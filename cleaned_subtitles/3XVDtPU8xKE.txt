So for everyone that I haven't met before, I'm Alex Rampel on the Apps Fund. I've been at the firm for 10 years. I stole this from Chris Dixon who published a post like this about probably 12 or 13 years ago. And the whole premise is that product cycles drive growth. And you know the top of the chart here is the NASDAQ from 1977 to present. It goes up sometimes, it goes down sometimes. Over the long run, it has gone up. But there have been some very scary down points. So there really there have been four major product cycles. There was the PC. Obviously before the PC, there was the semiconductor. But we got to start somewhere. We'll start with the PC. Um there's always an infrastructure layer of companies that are building the back end. There's the application layer of people that are building, you know, things that actually are used. So, you know, Lotus was one of the first infrastructure, sorry, application companies. Adobe, Semantic, all of these companies that kind of grew out of the 1980s. But the the infra players, if you were Apple and Microsoft, then you had the internet um that was enormous. lots of bubbles along the way but uh some very very enduring infrastructure companies like Cisco and Okami enduring companies in the application space like eBay and Amazon that were built on top of that then you had cloud so AWS accounts for the vast majority of market cap of Amazon you've got workday Shopify viva others that were the application layer um mobile took all of these things that came before and now put a supercomputer in everybody's pocket so the vast majority of humans on planet earth have a smartphone which is pretty amazing um and that was the mobile era which is still still actually kind of playing out. Like I just bought an Android phone to test things with. It was $40 and this was more powerful than like a super than the ENIAC in 1946 or whenever the ENIAC came out. And then two years ago was that this AI era is coming out as well. And uh you know the NASDAQ is higher. We we know that. But the AI era really is playing out. And the cool thing is this is not a net new thing. This is building on everything before. Like if we didn't have smartphones and we didn't have cloud, but we just had the eniac AI would be pretty cool. Like you could go check it out in a museum. But the fact is you now have, you know, 8 billion humans on planet Earth, the vast majority of whom have smartphones. And the adoption of this new technology is taking off like never before. So the AI layer, the the AI era is here. the the vast majority of uh net new revenue that's happening in software land is actually coming from AI both at the application layer and the infrastructure layer.
>> It's hard to to actually think back two years ago. At that point in time, of course, chat GPT uh 3 had launched. I think chat GPT4 had also launched, but it was all just text and and imaging and some basic reasoning, but none of the native audio stuff, obviously, real life uh real-time interaction, none of that actually um had happened yet. It's hard to even imagine how far we've come even in just the two-year time frame as a as a part of that.
>> Yeah. I mean, it's it's really remarkable like what these things have done. I mean, one of the ways of kind of joking about this is that, you know, we had this idea of artificial general intelligence or the touring test. Like when can we tell the difference between a computer and a human if we don't know who our interlocutor is? And the answer is like if you were to take a person 10 years ago and show them or 20 years ago or 30 like oh my god this is like a fully sentient this is smarter than any kind of human out there. We we kind of keep changing the goalpost a little bit on on what exactly is AGI but yes the the the the pace of innovation here is just remarkable and the important thing is just the opportunity set that that it unlocks. So there there was a paper very there's always whenever you have a bull market and very very exciting tech there's always somebody saying it's a bubble or it doesn't work or you know it's all overhyped and I think there was some MIT paper that came out um this is not faulty MIT this is somebody who published the paper it's like oh you know most enterprise deployments really really aren't working um in terms of AI um we're seeing the exact opposite and I'll I'll show two things so there's a company called RAMP um and they are kind of credit card expense management products And you see this giant tick up in January of 2025 which is you know when did enterprises and these are much more like who uses ramp. This is not necessarily a startup but it's a more forward thinking company. It's not necessarily GE. It's a company with, you know, thousands of employees, maybe in the Bay Area or New York, that wants to be more tech forward. And they've just realized like, wow, this stuff, Jen, to your point, like GPT 3.5, pretty good. Four. I was like, wow, it's pretty amazing. I could write a I could write a new episode of Seinfeld with it. Like amazing things that I could do almost to to kind of wow my friends, like a magic trick. But now the magic trick has actually gone into the enterprise and is saving people time and money. And uh you know one of the themes that you'll potentially get out of this presentation from me is that I have this this uh prevailing view of human behavior which is everybody wants two things. They want to be richer and lazier. So they want to do less work and get more economic value. And this is really what Gen AI unlocks. And it's really starting to happen right now. And this has been a little bit of a flat curve but it has been inflecting a lot. And you see this in the expense data. You see it in the growth of all of the companies both at the infrastructure layer and at the app layer. And you know again whether they're overvalued or undervalued is almost not the point. it's hard to time the market on these things. The amount of value that they are generating um is just tremendous and we're going to get into this in a second. Um so there there's a if anybody knows Maslo's hierarchy of needs like you know this is like this philosophical tome of what is it that humans need at the base of the pyramid you know people would joke is Wi-Fi. So, it's like, okay, I need all these things that have been true for hundreds of years. And at the very very top of that pyramid is this self-actualization concept, but what I really really need, if you talk to any teenager, it's like, you know, where's my Wi-Fi? Where's my Wi-Fi? And what's starting to happen now next is uh it's actually AI. Um, so obviously you can't have AI without the Wi-Fi, but um something like 15% of adults on planet Earth now use Chat GPT every single week. Um, and why are they using it? It's just part of their daily routine. you know, whether it's settling a bet with their friends over like, you know, how does this work or that work or I want directions to this thing or I'm really puzzled. My wife just used it to complain to the school because uh our kid missed the bus and the bus driver said he can't open the door because it's against the law to open the door. This is the true story. So, my wife, you know, had chat GPT scan all the laws in California um and the US um you know, federal system at large even though our government is closed down. Nope. That was completely made up. Send a very very polite note. Um, I'm sure that the school is going to start adopting Chat GBT2 to start responding to people like like my wife saying, you know, apologizing on behalf of the bus driver. But they did they did send an apology. Sorry, we made that up. Next time we could open the door for your child if he is on time when the the the bus has already closed the door. It's like a countably infinite number of use cases for these things. And the growth of minutes per user in the US, I mean, this is just astronomical. And as these things work better and as they unlock more use cases, it's kind of obvious that the uh the growth in minutes will go up. This is happening at a break neck speed. So the uh the key paper which was co-written by this this very very smart guy uh nom Shazir in 2017, attention is all you need. It introduced the transformer model. Um, I remember we have a partner here, Frank Chen, who's been here for a very, very long time, and he demoed chat GPT or GPT2. Um, and it like it didn't really work that well. It reminded me of this thing called Eliza, which was like a famous Marov chain based thing. It's like it was it was basically a therapist that came out. It was an AI based therapist in the 1960s or 1970s. It's still around. You could try it. And basically, you say like, you know, doctor, I'm not feeling well. And then it just kind of says, and why is it, Jen, that you aren't feeling well? It just basically takes the words that you say, turns it into a question. It feels kind of sentient until you ask it like, "Hey, I want to complain to the school about the bus driving." And then it says, "And why do you want to complain to the school about the bus driving?" It doesn't actually give you an answer or anything that you need. So, um, you know, OpenAI, it's it's hard to imagine that this just happened a couple years ago, but um, from 2023 until now, like we really have entered the golden age of apps. And I I base that purely numerically. I mean like the number of I'm used to companies that will grow from I don't know like we used to talk talk about like double double triple or triple triple double or all these different ways of measuring revenue growth because normally if you're selling a software product and let's just say that you're selling a software product to an enterprise and it's you know $100,000 a year you might sell a couple one year a couple the next year a couple the next year but very very rarely have we ever seen a software company go from zero to hund00 million in revenue in a year or two and we are seeing this right now and that that's why and this is not like oh we're seeing it because people have too much money and they're buying these things. These are companies that are buying these things because it unlocks so much value for them. Um they want to be lazier, they want to be richer and this is unlocking that. So I'm going to talk about three broader themes that we're seeing in AI applications. Really more broadly these are the types of companies that we're investing in. And partially this is uh when we ask ourselves what is defensible? Um what is it that the labs aren't going to do? Because this is a very very good question. It's not like OpenAI just wants to be this backend layer for everything. they have a leading consumer app like they just launched arguably a competitor to Tik Tok. Um so Microsoft is getting into the space in a meaningful way and if if you look at the history of software I mean this firm was started by Mark Andre. He started a company called Netscape. Netscape became roadkill um due to this company called Microsoft that went into an antitrust case because of making Netscape roadkill and whatnot. But um how do you build an enduring company and what are the what are the areas that potentially have the most enduring growth? And there are three that I'm going to lay out. So the first is um you know basically traditional software is going AI native. And this is no different than like if you could have built a time machine if you built a time machine right now go back 15 20 years and say I'm just going to invest in every single cloudnative company that pops up. You would have an incredible portfolio. You'd have Shopify. You'd have Viva. Um you'd have Netswuite when Netswu's a little bit older. you'd have, you know, Salesforce when it went first went public because it turned out that the incumbents couldn't really respond to that because they were selling on premise software or shrink wrap software um for a lot of money upfront and they didn't really know how to go for like less money every single month as a subscription. So, you know, category one is Trad software that's going AI native. Category two is arguably the biggest, which is basically it's not competing with the software market at all. This is um if any of you saw my talk that I gave in May, um software is starting to eat labor. You're basically selling software that does the job of what people would do before. This is arguably a much much bigger market. The the the laws of business still apply. You have to build real modes. You can't just build something that's a little widget that somebody underprices your widget by a dollar tomorrow. We're going to talk about that in a second. And then lastly, um I call this the walled garden, but basically really really interesting proprietary data models where the value of this business because you're able to deliver the finished product thanks to AI becomes much more valuable. And uh I'll talk about number one. So existing categories are going AI native. So this is a little we actually have a post coming out about this in a couple days. Um but I'm sure everybody here has heard of bingo or played bingo. I'm from Florida. There's lots of bingo in Florida. Um lots of different names on this list. And um one of the key lessons that I had as an investor is um you know and Mercury is kind of a great example of the tortoise that beat and is you know still beating the hair. Mercury built a neo bank for startups. So, they said, "We're going to be the better source for you when you start your company to go deposit your money with us. We're going to, you know, help you pay your bills, um, track your expenses, be a basic accounting system." Mercury never stole an existing customer from Silicon Valley Bank until the weekend that Silicon Valley Bank failed. And it is what I would call the canonical green field opportunity versus brownfield opportunity. So, brownfield is you're selling to an existing market. So, let's just take an example here. um email marketing, you use Mailchimp, I want to go sell you a competitor to Mailchimp because it has AI. That's going to be really hard. Or you use Netswuite and I'm going to say like, hey, ditch your Netswuite. I'm going to give you AI Netswuite. That's going to be really hard. If you're a net new company, and this is what I mean by green field. You have no existing product. You're not using anything. You're a brand new company. Or sometimes you hit an inflection point. So the inflection point, I'll pick on Netswuite here for a second. Um the inflection point is I have 50 employees now. I have three entities and two currencies. I've been using QuickBooks my entire life. Uh QuickBooks can't handle for whatever reason they cannot handle multi-entity multicurrency support very well. KPMG says, "Hey, you got to go move to a better ERP system that supports that." And now I have an opportunity to pick the better product in the market and Netswuite is a product in the market or I can try this thing called real uh which is one of our companies which is basically like Netswuite but it closes the books for you. It has 50 AI features built in. That is a Greenfield example. Now, these things don't grow like weeds because you have to wait for the new company creation. Um, you're going entirely for green field and not for brownfield. But every single one of these spots on this bingo board, the incumbents are all adopting AI and they're going to make their businesses much much better with AI. Like bill.com is going to be a stronger business or SAP is going to be a stronger business or Adobe is going to be a stronger business because of AI. They're just going to be able to charge for new things. Workday will start charging, and I mentioned this in my presentation that I gave a couple months ago. Workday will say, "Hey, do you do you want us to do reference checks on every new employee that you enter into our system? That's $500 per reference check. Why can't somebody do it for $4.99?" Because you're stuck with Workday. And there's a saying that I use a lot, which is the best companies have hostages, not customers. And I'll talk about a couple examples here. Um, so RPA, there's an existing company called UiPath, public company. Um, customer support, there's an existing company called Zenesk. It's now a private company. uh ERP, SAP, Netswuite or in some cases like Zenesk charges per seat per month. That is almost an extinct business model for support software because well wait a minute I don't want to pay per seat per month when 99% of all queries can be answered by the support software I want to pay per outcome. So we've been aggressively betting on the bingo board let's evaluate every company that we see in this space. So if it's payroll, if it's support, if it's ERP um and the important thing is that these are systems of record. So this is the the best companies take hostages, not customers. Uh like we don't want to invest in hostage companies. We don't want to invest in companies that have negative 100 NPS. We want to invest in companies that still have a very very strong mo. And that's what I mean when I use that expression. Um so all of the companies that we're looking at here, what is a system of record? It just means like it runs the entire business. Everything on that bingo board like how do you get rid of of of Netswuite? It's basically impossible. you can enter in with an AI wedge or um you know more often than not a lot of these bingo categories are we're just building the new system of record. Um the existing incumbent is doing that as well but it still is a no-brainer whenever you're brand new in the market or at this inflection point of do I use this old one or do I need this this new one. So uh next here. So the second theme here uh which I am personally most excited about is where new categories are emerging where labor is is software and there's no bingo board for this at all. And the reason why is because there weren't software companies that did this before. And like the predominant theme is that you have a lot of things where you would hire a person, you can't hire that person or that person that you were going to hire doesn't speak 21 different foreign languages and won't work 24 hours a day. But software can do 90% of what that human would do. Now, you will pay for software, not necessarily at the same like rate that you would pay for labor, but this is not something that you would hire a software product for. This is not something you would ever have a software product for before. So, I'll talk about a couple examples here. Um, and obviously, you know, I mentioned this, I can mention this ad nauseium, but the labor market is astronomically bigger than the software market. So, next, um, so again, this is kind of the governing principle here. You go look at a job, front desk receptionist, Plaza Lane Optometry. Plaza Lane Optometry has like they have a a bingo board as well in terms of software that they spend uh money on. They probably spend money on Microsoft Office. They probably spend money on Squarespace or Wix. That's on the order of $500 a year. If you can deliver them a software product that does, you know, call it five out of the eight things on this job posting, they will hire that software product. What do they pay for that software product? This is the part of the market that is almost unknown. Um because they're probably they're almost definitely not going to pay the $47,000 a year that they're advertising for this job or whatever the the the rate is that they're paying for the job. Um they're probably not going to pay $500 for software. Um but the the the promoter, the the creator, developer of this software product, an application software company, might say, you know, we're going to charge you $20,000 a year. They need to be careful about how they do this. We often want to see them turn into a system of records so that if they are doing, you know, five of these eight job responsibilities, somebody doesn't pop up and say, "We're going to charge $19,999 a year." We want to make sure that this is a very, very sticky end solution for Plaza Lane Optometry. You're going to see, I believe, a lot of market cap creation on the bingo board of existing software products that have a new better alternative that are going after Greenfield. But here, you can go after Brownfield. You can go after existing companies. you could probably charge a lot more. There was a path to much much more explosive revenue growth.
>> But just to maybe to take a step back, you've probably heard a ton about what's happening in legal AI. You know, just given how document intensive the industry is, there's tons of applications for LLMs in the space. Most of what you've probably heard are around companies like Harvey, you know, serving the defense and the corporate side. Maybe less familiar to you might be the plaintiff side, which is really about representing the individuals in areas like employment law or personal injury. And you know, we we spent a bunch of time looking at, you know, the different com companies on the plaintiff side. In part because one of the unique characteristics about that side of the market is that these attorneys operate on a contingency basis, meaning they only get paid if they win. And so they're incredibly aligned with their clients. They don't they don't build by the hour, you know, they they take a percentage of the of the actual case outcome. And so as a result, you know, for every hundred leads that a plaintiff attorney gets, they often take one case because anytime you take a case, it's an investment in your time and your labor. So just incredible alignment with AI's impact on their core business model, right? To to contrast that, if you're a corporate attorney, you know, and you're, you know, you know, junior uh attorney is 50 times more productive, you just eroded some of the revenue that you can actually charge to your end client. Again, in this case, if you can make your attorneys, you know, 5x more productive, you can potentially increase, you know, your revenue by 5x or more. And so, the EVE guys had a a particular particularly interesting um kind of point of view from a product perspective, they really wanted to own the endto-end workflow from intake all the way to outcomes. And so uh you know to Alex's point earlier around voice you know they recently launched a voice agent which is actually collecting evidence you know from their prospective clients and it's sifting through you know mountains of you know medical records or employment documents and helping these attorneys you know figure out which cases to take because it is generating sort of this data set of you know case characteristics such that it can say hey this case is potentially worth 50k you know this case is worth $5 million. you should probably spend time, you know, on this case over here. And then it'll just help step through all the different phases of prelitigation and litigation for these attorneys. So, it'll draft a medical chronology. It'll draft a kind of core artifact of these cases, which is known as a demand letter. Um, it'll file complaints. Um, and ultimately, I think what's so interesting about this business, and it speaks to, I think, why Moes matter, you know, one is these attorneys are living in this product all day long. like one of the core you know pieces of feedback that we heard when we were diligencing the business was that literally 100% of the cases were flowing through the product but interestingly as Eve begins to generate data on outcomes that data isn't public right that's not something that the large you know labs can train models against and that data is actually informing better intake right so that they can then go back and say at intake hey given the characteristics that we've seen in all the cases that we prosecuted across all the you know the e platform you know, these have these three variables that make this case potentially worth a lot more money. Or to Alex's point, it can, you know, reduce the cost of taking on a case. You know, before an attorney was only taking a case that, you know, at minimum could potentially make them 50k and suddenly they can afford to take cases at 5k. You know, the market expands, right? And and there's a a big sort of supply and demand imbalance, you know, t on on the plaintiff side that that EV is unlocking. And as a result, you know, just the market pull for this product has been candidly like stronger than we even anticipated. You know, you know, my hope is that it has a lot of characteristics that we'll be, you know, continuously investing in where AI is just incredibly aligned with the business, both, you know, driving revenue and uh, you know, saving these folks money.
>> Well, thanks J. Yeah. And the reason why I wanted to talk about that is I I think it's it's really cool as Eve, but it's a metaphor for the types of businesses that we find compelling and and why, you know, 0 to 30 certainly or 2 to 30 is not normal, but it actually is normal if you're able to move very very quickly and just deliver again this this promise of I'm going to make you lazier and richer. Um so let's go to the next slide. Actually before we go to to salient Alex why don't we just take some of these questions here because they're relevant in the context of an example and then also um before we switch to salient uh exemplify why why we find these to be particularly compelling. So there's a good question here from Brian. A lot of consumptionbased AI apps have found it hard to become mission critical. They're easy to switch on or off as a part of the broader suite. How do you evaluate that in diligence? Maybe David if you want to use uh Eve as an example or other others that we have in the portfolio. How do you evaluate that intelligence and what patterns have you seen around in which apps actually graduate to being essential?
>> Yeah, I mean what one of the distinctions that I often draw is this notion of um differentiation versus defensibility. And I think AI is an incredible tool often for differentiation, right? So the idea that the voice agent can speak to folks in 50 languages and gather that evidence, you know, highly differentiated versus the human, right? obviously delivering value but that capability alone in my opinion is not a source of their defensibility right the source of defensibility for Eve is in owning the end workflow right it is actually in building a product that is contextual to you know all the work that that attorney has to do and then I think you know not unique to e but one of the kind of uh x factors is that the data that that business is generating which Alex will get into a bit in this sort of walled garden it has a bit of these characteristics of this sort of walled garden um is not public and it sort of creates a source of compounding competitive advantage, you know, for the product itself, right? So, the more cases that Eve can prosecute for all their different clients, you know, the smarter that the product becomes and it actually, you know, kind of reinforces that loop. It becomes sort of, you know, you're showing you're showing up to a knife fight with a gun, right? And so soon it's going to become an essential tool for any plaintiff attorney to operate with. Um, and that just becomes very difficult to displace, right? So, it's not so much the AIS, right, in the voice or or the ability to summarize documents. it's actually in becoming kind of the system record this end workflow
>> for sure. Um and in fact actually yeah there's multiple threats to pull on it but maybe I'll answer uh ask this question first uh relatedly around um talking about the potential upside of market size of these companies around um labor versus vertical software bucket and how do companies in this category build defensible most um and particularly earn attractive margins as AI proliferates and and costs continue to scale down.
>> Yeah. Why don't we come back to that one at the end because I think hopefully what you'll get from it's not like we're just investing in companies that do labor and then the end. Um there modes matter if in fact more than ever because the one thing that's happened in software is once upon a time there was a company called Word Perfect and Word Perfect kind of like kept growing for a very very long time or once upon a time there was a company called VisiCal and then whoever had the most distribution said I should do that copies it and obviously you know Word Perfect is toast, Visical is toast. Lotus 123 which was the one that beat Visical that became toast but it would normally take 5 years for the the bread to become toast and there was a very very high level of prolific speed I mean now um you know Anish David and I and Jen can go build a software product we can vibe code if you've heard that term we can go build software very very quickly what makes it actually increases the peril for anybody who's built a software product that has an enormous margin pool you know your margin is my opportunity well I can vibe Well, I could vibe code against your opportunity. It has to be very very sticky. It has to have some unique competitive advantage and data is often one of those. So, if I work with every plaintiff law firm or you know actually why don't we go to the next slide here and I'll just talk about salient a little bit. Sorry. Uh so, so salient is is in the EVE mold. Um and I know we also had a question about like you know what is the societal impact of everybody losing their job. Like I don't think that's actually going to happen very quickly. uh you know 98% of Americans were farmers in 1789 and obviously the the tractor made some of them unemployed and made them do other things but most of what we're seeing candidly is not about eliminating work. I mean I do think that the three and a half million people that drive trucks at some point in time like we have a better solution than the truck the truck driving human you have you know AI doing that but most of these things they're really it it's like you have cost here you have value here you would never hire a human where they are producing less value than their cost it just does not make sense but if you can now hire AI u effectively you can hire AI where the amount of value that like the cost is has gone down, the value has stayed the same. You're going to hire a lot of AI. You're not going to get rid of a lot of humans. And if anything, um we never know. This is so hard to predict, but what will humans do? I mean, like there was no job of like product manager 75 years ago uh at a software company or designer. Like all of these jobs that exist today, they wouldn't have made any sense to somebody in 1800. So, it's hard to it's hard to kind of pontificate on that. But a lot of the things that we're seeing, they're not displacing people per se. Okay. I mean, I know it sounds piffy to say software is eating labor, but really software is augmenting labor or it's like all of these people that I can't hire, whether there's a job shortage or a skill shortage or whatever. I can now deploy people that will answer a phone like I I would just never hire somebody to go answer the phone for me at 2 a.m. I would hire somebody at 4 p.m. but not at 2 a.m. It's just the value to cost equation is inverted. Um, and kind of a great example of this is like the the salient, yes, they are going to people that collect um uh it's it's called autoloan servicing. So, you go to an auto lender, they have to go make sure that they're collecting on their bills or if the person's in a car accident and the insurance carrier is at, you know, supposed to pay you. How do I make sure that that insurance carrier is paying me on time and writing the check to the right person? In this case, because I have the the lease, like they need to write it to me and not the actual, you know, not not the person uh in in their actual name. How do I do all of that kind of stuff? I would hire lots of people. I would train lots of people. A lot of these people hate their jobs because it turns out um people yell at them all day and say, "I'm not paying you back for this car or the insurance carrier keeps you on hold for four hours and that whole music is just terrible and you're gonna want to kill yourself if you have to listen to that 12 hours a day." Like all these reasons why humans don't want to do this or you can't hire humans for this. The key thing with Saliant is not that they're saving you money. Um the key thing with Saliant is that they collect 50% more. Like this is the key thing because um Arya the CEO, he kept pitching like I'm going to save you money. I'm going to save you money. I'm going to save you money. Like people like saving money, but if you go to somebody and say, "I will collect 50% more revenue for you every single month, and I will make sure that you don't go to jail because none of these people that you hire that aren't very well trained that have to listen to this horrible hold music for four hours a day, they don't say something that they're not supposed to say, I can make sure that AI doesn't do any of these things." Like, that's why that company is growing so explosively. It really is. It's it's much more about the value generation. I mean, yes, the cost is much lower. And this is one of the questions around like how do they figure out how to how to charge for the product? They went to their first um client had a $50 million a year call center with I think a 40 to 70% annualized churn rate per employee. So it's just and not because they're firing people. It's just like nobody wants this job. Um so they now say I will do it for you with software. Um I will give you a system of record. I will make sure that we're scraping every single new federal and state statute because what you say in Missouri is very, very different than what you have to say in California is very different than what you say in Iowa. We're going to do all of these things. No human can keep that in their head at the same time. It's like, all right, I'm talking to David. Shoot. What do I say? He's uh from Santa, you know, he's somewhere in California. Oh, wait, but actually he's traveling to like Kansas. I don't know what to say. Like salient knows exactly what to say and it knows how to say it in 21 languages and that's why the the collections rate is 50% higher. So like this whole category of like we are going to make you more money um and and it's going to cost you less like it's just it's a very very hard thing to move away from. The key question for us which I think is a very good question is how do we make sure that we're backing the right one and how do we make sure that salient is not I mean this was my number one question when when Ari came in I was like well how are imagine that there's a company called Taliant and a company called salient why is it that salient is going to be talent and salient and and Ari actually had Ari the CEO had a very very good answer to this not to like you know he looked up on chat GPT how do I answer this difficult question from a VC but again modes matter um we know exactly what script to say um this is an example of kind of a data mode. It's like because we've done millions of phone calls, we know exactly what to say. Um we have lower latency on every single like statute that comes out from like we they actually have like a very very good product that ingests every single law like as it is even proposed as a statute in all 50 states. Sometimes it's at the county level. Like they're doing all of these things that make it so much harder to compete so that they will not lose a deal. You know, modes matter more than ever because you're able to create software so much more readily. Actually, maybe this is a good dub to to this section, which is does this then mean software becomes way way way more specific in certain categories and it doesn't need to win a bunch of different categories and to become a huge business and and I think that might actually be a good dubtail to this theme that that you want to cover here.
>> Yeah, I mean this is the thing that we don't know. I mean like we obviously have many examples of vertical software companies that have become very big. So Service Titan is a vertical software company. Um, MindBody is a vertical software company. Toast, that's a very large vertical software company. Toast is designed for restaurant tours to run their business, to integrate with Door Dash, to pay their weight staff, to do land, like everything around operating a business. It's a vertical operating system. It's very, very hard to displace one of those. People would have doubted how big that could become. And actually, a lot of people did like it was very hard for Toast to raise their B- round because people would say, "Well, I look at the the restaurant space and like, you know, half these restaurants go out of business every year. I look at how much software they buy. Well, they don't buy any software, so therefore this is a bad company. I'm not going to invest in it." And and you know, fast forward 10 years. Um, but the reason why that happened was it turned out the business was much bigger in this case because they added financial services. And the financial services were we're going to do lending to restaurants. We're going to do payment processing for restaurants and we make it very very sticky because it's an entire software platform and there's no way for first data or global payments or any of these companies that traditionally do software to go append a sorry that traditionally do payment processing to append some kind of software solution. So that's why toast you know people got toast wrong. It's a very valuable company and a public company today. Um I think the same thing applies for I'm adding in labor. Like it's not just I do labor and then somebody does labor for a penny cheaper. I have I I need to build some kind of system of record for you, some kind of vertical operating system for you so that you can't just go switch out for the cheaper player. And maybe this is a good way to kind of go into theme three here. Um, which I'm I'm very excited about. And I I call this the walled garden. Um, and this is really important today because if you look at like take take a metaphor here where this amazing company called OpenAI shows up and they're like, "Hey, we're a vegetable farm and we're we're farming tokens um and we're going to sell tokens. We're going to charge for tokens to all these people out there that are building applications. So it plays out exactly as I talked about like OpenAI is an infrastructure company. We invest in all these application companies. But then OpenAI is like you know what we should put some restaurants on our farm because a lot of people come to our farm. Let's just have restaurants here. And then all these restaurant turns are like wait a minute like you're selling me vegetables now you're competing with me. Like that that that's not good. Um, the reason why I bring this up as an example is because it actually is happening and it's a blueprint for how to potentially deal with a world where um, the the the source of the raw material is actually what is rare. So, let's go to the next slide and I'll show you like I'll make this a little bit clearer, but as I mentioned, this is kind of like the world's second oldest profession. There are lots of cases where I I I kind of construct some physical property, I build a wall around it and I charge you for access to my property. You can do this in the data world as well. And you know, I'll pick an example on this little this this little bingo board here of FlightAware. Um I'm not sure how many people have heard of FlightAware. How do they get their data? And their their data, by the way, what is their data? There's nothing proprietary about it. It's all public. Um you can buy an antenna on Amazon to receive it's called ADSB transponder data. So, every single airplane after that Malaysian plane went missing. Um, has a little transp transponder on it that shows its height, its speed, all these different attributes on it, beams it down to planet Earth. Um, antennas can pick this up and figure out, you know, this tail number is at this place. I can buy one. It's free. Flight I think they have something like a hundred antennas around the world. They pick up all this information and they can char that. That's a piece of data like I can ask chat GPT that. They don't know that. Um, only FlightAware knows that or Pitchbook does this for funding rounds. Like who know who knew what the, you know, series B price of a company in 1992 was? Like Pitchbook somehow has that or Lexus Nexus knows this. Co-Star knows this for uh real estate data. Bloomberg knows this for all sorts of exotic financial stuff. Like it's in many cases it's all free. Ancestry.com built their entire data mode by buying genealogical records from the Mormon church. All of this stuff is not available on chat GPT. It's not available on anthropic. Of course, they can license it, but the reason why I mention this is what do you do with FlightAware data or what do you do with Bloomberg data or what do you like I'll tell you what I do with pitchbook data? I hire an analyst and I say analyst go write me a memo about this company called EVE and compare it to every other company in the legal space that had ever done something before. And PitchBook just sells us a subscription for here's every single series B of legal tech company since 1992. Okay, that's valuable. They can charge $20 or $200 or whatever they charge per month for that. What would be more valuable is saying because they're the only ones that actually have that piece of information. They should probably charge $2,000 for that, which might mean, I mean, maybe this makes you nervous. We might need one less analyst because now we have a finished product because we, what we don't want is we don't just want a subscription to pitchbook data. We actually want to do something with it. We want to somehow take that vegetable, if you follow my metaphor, and turn it into a finished meal. Um, you know, one of my favorite examples here is domain tools. Domain tools does, they have one thing which is very interesting. They run a who is query which says who owns a particular domain name. This company has been around for a very very long time. If I want to figure out who owned a domain in 1998, there's one place to go and that's domain tools. So like this model has been around for a very very long time before AI. Very very large companies exist in this space. When you add AI, it makes it tremendously more valuable. So I'll give you three examples that hopefully kind of hammer this point home. So there's a company called Open Evidence, which if you use it, apparently two-thirds of doctors in America use this thing pretty much every week. Um, Open Evidence is exactly like ChatGpt. The interface looks exactly like ChatGpt, except you know who has exclusive license to the New England Journal of Medicine and every other medical journal out there, Open Evidence. Um, so if I I tore my Achilles if I want to read about what I should do, all of the evidence-based care out there, I can go to Chat GBT. It's it's moderately useful. There's no reason not to do that. Open evidence is so much better because they're the only ones that actually have. They've built in this case, they found all the data. They found all the unique vegetables out there. They convinced the vegetable seller not to sell it to any other restaurant and they have a restaurant that delivers the whole thing where there's a 26-y old company called Vlex. Incredible company that just got bought. Um the I I the CEO was telling me that the origin story of this company. He's from Spain. He bought up every single legal record in Spain. Um and why would you want to buy up legal records? Because I don't know, Wilson Cinci wants to know, you know, Spanish case law in case Andre Horowitz goes invest in a company and figure you needs to figure something out. So VLEX would uh aggregate and digitize this information, sell it to law firms and other people that need legal information. Pretty high gross margin, but you know, very very low scale and predominantly European and Spain. Um then they were like, you know what, we should add AI to this. And um apparently it quintupled their revenue. And why would it quintuple their revenue? I might love Harvey. I pay for Harvey, amazing product, but if I want to have a finished memo for my client at 7 a.m. I can't get a parallegal to go do this. and I know that it needs to incorporate some element of Spanish legal data like VLEx is my only solution and instead of charging $2 a month or $2 an article or $200 a month or whatever they can charge for the raw material and what Ask Leo does is it's a procurement product. So if I'm a company um and every company, every employee at every company kind of hates their procurement department because on the one hand the procurement department is supposed to save the company money by making sure that some rogue employee doesn't buy, you know, expensive widgets at an at an overpriced uh price from a unapproved vendor. But on the other hand, they they introduce all sorts of complexity into the process. So imagine that I've got a contract from Deote to give me AI and and and you know somehow revitalize my company. um who has 50 other contracts from deote where I can understand what I push back on like that. That is actually very very useful proprietary information. I wish I could go ask chat GPT for this but they don't have the world's treasure trove like what what is the information they will never get. They're never going to get 50 old Deote contracts. Like where would you find them? I guess you could do a foyer request or something but you're not going to find them. And ask Leo has these. So it just makes the product so much better. And go go back one slide here. Um, it's hard to say where we're going to find these things, but the the the most compelling of the ones that we found are it's like all of the information is free. Just like ADSB flight transponder data, that's free, but you find something that just like it wasn't worth that much before because like what do you do with flight data? What do you do with who is record data on the internet? Um, I actually talked to an entrepreneur recently. He was like, "Oh yeah, you know what? I like to figure out historical subscriber data on of YouTubers." is like YouTube doesn't publish like how many subscribers Mr. Beast had on August 4th, you know, 2017. Like where would you find that? There's some company that collates that, collects that, and that's just they're just selling the data. It's not available anywhere else. And you know, these are some uh we just published a post. I would encourage people to read it on like, you know, the walled garden or we called it fruits of the walled garden. all of these things like creative archives, logistics, like you go to like some county recorders office and you can see who owns what property record, but you have to go to the county recorders office to to find that. It's all free, but you can digitize that, make that available, and then add AI to that. And this sounds like, oh, just a add AI. It's much more valuable. The reason why is because you're saying, I have something that nobody else has. There's a reason why people are buying this before because they're trying to create something that that is of higher value at the end and you can now do this. So, you know, go to every museum or actually I just talked to an entrepreneur um who found every old manual. This is a great example. Found every old manual for like blenders made in the 1980s, 1990s. Like just you can buy this stuff for pretty much nothing on eBay. Where would you find a manual for an old blender in 1999? I have no idea. But apparently eBay is where you find it. But it just shows like these these walled gardens that you can build with data. Um you could have built this before you could build a 10 or 100 times more valuable company today. So Alex, can I pause you here um in part because you know the last era of investing you gave a great framework in the world a great framework for thinking about the battle between startups and incumbents and you know if startups could figure out distribution before incumbents can figure out innovation that was you know their their success win like how how take us through the dynamic of when you're thinking about which companies to invest into where it's very clear that they can disrupt you know the incumbents in the category and where you know what are the examples where it probably doesn't make a lot of sense for someone to build a company like and that has a a proprietary walled garden that is going to be very difficult to unseat.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think there are two ways of thinking about this. Number one is in the case of the used blenders on eBay or the manuals like there just wasn't a company before um charging for access to the subscription of like I'm going to sell you, you know, per data article that I've digitized or I'm going to charge you $20 a month. Like, you know, probably not that interesting. But now if you have this finished product that you can charge a thousand dollars for versus like the raw material that you charge a dollar for, maybe now the business is tenable. So, so one category is you just find a new data source and there's a reason why like you know in venture capital school we learn to always ask why now? Like if this is such a great idea, why didn't this exist 10 years ago? Great answer for Uber when it came out. There was no iPhone and no GPS transponder in every device. Um once you have that, now you can have Uber. Um, the why now for some of these more esoteric things is it's it's kind of like a little bit of a why now. Like why isn't this a $20 million business like VLEX after struggling for 26 years? Why is it now a hundred million dollar business? It's because you can deliver the finished product. Um, and of course like there are I I would argue like a lot of the old things that were out there like ancestry.com is a valuable company. they digitized LDS data and a lot of people want to figure out where they came from and there's an NBC show that says you know what are your roots and people like watching that and all these kinds of things you know it's a valuable company that would be one where it's like I would be hardressed to say how do you make that dramatically better with AI maybe it's like I want to say hey please I'm about to die I want to figure out which one of my errors to leave all of my money to please email them and set up dates with me so I can figure that out and like that's the value ad that you do with this proprietary data um this is why I'm an investor, not an entrepreneur anymore. I'm out of good ideas. Um, but that would be something where, you know, there is an existing data store. U maybe I licensed that like Open Evidence. They didn't create new medical journal entries. They were just like, "Hey, let's go distribute to doctors. We know that doctors are really interested in this stuff. We know that all of the information is in these old medical journals and the back catalog is very uh very very useful." Like it turned out like I think um of all the the things that Michael Jackson did right and wrong um probably the the most right from an economics perspective was buying the back catalog of the Beatles um or like he he bought a big chunk of that that ended up being worth a lot because until the copyright runs out like Beatles catalog a lot of people like listening to the Beatles that's going to become more valuable. So you can buy existing stuff that is already out there that already has a business and that's like open evidence or you can try to create something net new which is kind of more of the ask Leo. So I I I don't know if that perfectly answers your question, but my view on on everything that's happening in AI right now is it's one of these weird situations where it's very different than cloud where most on-prem software providers were like cloud is stupid. Most potential customers were like cloud is stupid. It's not safe. I don't trust it. I want to host things like you'd have your entire IT staff is like I don't trust that stuff. So the the existing incumbents did not build cloud providers like Peopleoft did not say let's go build Peopleoft Cloud. They have it now. Um, but uh that's where that's where Workday came from. They were like, "We're going to build this." It took a while for the business to c for the for the for everything to catch up. I'm very very bullish on incumbents. Um, I I I hope I can say that because I don't think that I think Netswuite is going to figure out 15 different ways to monetize with AI. I think that Quickbook in it has this gold mine on their hands where they're they're just going to start charging per collections that they make to all of their existing hostages that use QuickBooks. Um, but that still does not mean that you don't have these green field opportunities. You don't have these new data opport like there's so many new opportunities that have popped up largely because of this value cost thing. It's like you have so many like it's this infinite number of things where it's like I find something where everybody would want this at $5, but it is currently only sold for $10. Therefore, nobody wants it. Therefore, it's not a business. Wait a minute. AI allows me to sell it for $5. So, it's it's really one of these rare situations where it's good for both. Whereas I think mobile, like most people love, Blackberry was great. iPhone was stupid. That's why the incumbents didn't, you know, that's why, you know, why didn't Booking.com build Airbnb? Why why didn't uh I don't know, uh, taxi cab company build Uber? It's just most people thought this was stupid. Everybody thinks that this is a good idea because of course intelligent like you know, AGI and everybody's pocket is a very good idea. No, nobody can argue against that. It's more of um the the existing incumbents. This is why I'm just I'm I'm bearish on the brownfield opportunity on the bingo board. I'm very very bearish on I'm sorry. I'm very bullish on the brownfield opportunity for the for like walled gardens and for um kind of software that does the job of labor.
>> For sure. By the way, I thought you were gonna say the smartest thing Michael Jackson did was let his family use his likeness for the Michael Jackson live show, which I according to Ben has now generated more revenue uh from that show than his entire existence uh as a performer. But anyway,
>> but I give him more credit for like I I think apparently what happened was somebody was like, "You know what? You know where the money is?" It's like that it's it's like that movie The Graduate. It's like Plastics, right? Somebody was like put Michael Jackson aside. You know where the money is? Back cataloges.
>> Good point. I have a lot of I'm going to I'm going to go buy the Beatles back catalog and then I'll make money from it because this, you know, CDs are going to come out and streaming is going to come out and there's so many different ways of monetizing this. So,
>> smart move smart move by demand. Uh
>> let's let's uh
>> well actually let's cover some of the the there was um question about the walled garden uh metaphor that Daniel had here. So, the implication is that the new restaurant is direct to consumer. Why wouldn't the company sell to the end user rather than a business that is ultimately the intermediary?
>> This is a great question. So this is like VLEX is a good example of this, right? Like VLEX could have sold their data to Harvey. Um instead they realize this exact point. It's like they should just be in this business of selling directly to they they they shouldn't be selling to to Wilson Cinci anymore or if they are they should dramatically change the pricing of their product. they should change their pricing strategy and instead of saying we're going to charge you know this like tiny subscription fee and allow so much of the value creation to occur elsewhere we're going like open AAI on their you know OpenAI charges very very little per million tokens we're just going to consume that and then enrich everything that we have that is proprietary to us and then go sell that directly so um you know it's a good question but I think the point from an investment lens is we a lot of entrepreneurs are now looking for sometimes it's like existing companies where it's like they don't know what's going on they can just buy that data those existing companies if they're run by an entrepreneurial CEO like they realize wow I can make my business 10 times better and we're going to go invest in those um and then lastly I'm just going to buy some antenna from Amazon and like listen to Malaysian Airlines flights or whatever and then aggregate this information that's completely free but it's not free past tense right like the number of subscrib subscribers that Mr. Beast had 5 years ago, like the number of subscribers today, you just go to YouTube, you see exactly what that is. If I wanted to see what that was 10 years ago, that's what is actually proprietary. So sometimes the proprietariness, if you will, everything is free. Anybody can go collect this stuff that's free. The value only accrews over time. Um, and there are a lot of examples of this. Like, you know, I can go to the Mormon church and get my genealogical information. um and they'll probably give it to me and I don't have to go pay for an ancestry.com account, but it's kind of useful and easier to just do it with ancestry.com than to go fly to Utah. So, so sometimes just the the ease of going to somebody who's already digitized um and put this this information in an easier to digest form. That's one of the reasons why like people go to Lexus Nexus. That's one of the reasons why people go to a lot of these providers because sometimes they're the only game in town, sometimes they're the best game in town. Um, but increasingly today they're the ones that can actually give me a finished product and actually it saves the end customer money as well because I don't really want to buy Lexus Nexus data. I just want to know if I should accept or reject this transaction. Um, and there's a lot of enrichment that I do of the data. There's a lot of workflow. There are a lot of analysts. Like if I'm a financial services company, I hire fraud analysts to go tell me what's going on. And the raw vegetable uh that I I need to figure this out is this Lexus Nexus information. But Lexus Nexus like this is this would be kind of bullishness for an incumbent probably can do a lot of things if they're the only ones that have that information.
>> Great. Um Alex, I feel like you paid Joe to to ask this question, but I'm going to take it here and then we'll switch gears to to um Anish uh your your two sections here. Uh what is your view on white collar services AI roll-ups, i.e. fully verticalized software plus services companies that are popping up.
>> Yeah. So, um I wrote an article about this two years ago. I called it Barbarians at the Gate, but where the the Barbarians is spelled with an AI uh in homage to the RJR Noiscoco deal in the 1980s and a book that was written about that. I mean, I think it's very interesting is what we're great at is like here are two people that are going to change the world. They don't know how they're going to do it. We're buying an out-of-the-m call option. Um there are a lot of private equity firms out there that are like we're good at firing everybody and like you know moving people to the Philippines and doing this and doing that and all of these kinds of things like this is a big thing that private equity is looking at the same time we do have a couple bets in this space and um it's it's you know very very smart entrepreneur but there's never a question of um can I get more clients as an accountant because I can't hire more CPAs to do tax returns. It's like the hardest part is to get the clients. So you have to go to the Chamber of Commerce meetings. Like it's just very very hard to buy one accounting firm and then by virtue of like all sorts of cost synergies, you can now onboard 10,000 more clients. Like that's just like the way that you would have to play that game is you buy one accounting firm, you like integrate it for nine months, then you go buy another accounting firm, then you buy another accounting firm. And yes, is there value at the end? Absolutely. But you probably have to buy 200 accounting firms and then you're left with a pretty interesting business. And there's probably a big competitor called, you know, mid-market PE who's done this for 500, you know, years, not yours, but has done this 500 times and they're going to do a better job of that playbook. On the other hand, there is a strategy that we think is very interesting, which is instead of having a sales team, you buy one. So, you know, take the example of debt collection. I could buy a publicly traded debt collector that has lots of people, that doesn't do a very good job, that doesn't follow lots of laws. Um, and I want to get started somehow. I I I built this great tool that I believe in. I want to dog food it. I don't have any customers right now. I know I'll buy a company that has declining revenue but five blue chip clients. I'll buy this company for three times EBITDA. And now I'll transform it with AI. And now I don't have to buy a second one. I don't have to buy a third one. I don't have to buy a fourth one. I can just say I have better collections rates. Um I have five blue chip customers that love me and I'm cheaper. So do you want to be lazier and richer? like yes I already have the customers to back this up and I can now onboard a thousand customers into the existing acquisition that I made. That's actually quite interesting. So the question is which one are you doing? And I think the we're going to go roll up you know a hundred dental clinics or we're going to and we're going to make it better. We're going to roll up you know dermat I have a friend that rolls up dermatology clinics. It's like I just don't think we're good at that game. Um, and the problem is that dermatology clinics are like just because I bought one in San Carlos, it doesn't help me like do anything in Florida. I got to go buy more there. Uh, same with accountants. Uh, versus, you know, debt collection that's very very national. You could buy one and then, you know, that is your entry point. And it's kind of an opportunity cost. Do I hire salespeople um to go sell um or if the best companies have hostages, not customers, do I buy some company that is stagnant and even shrinking because they don't know how to respond to AI? Because by the way all of these companies like every debt collection company like they'd be crazy not to look into doing AI on their own. So it is this battle between startup and incumbent but there there is an interesting opportunity and we've done one in the um in the MSP space um managed service provider for IT um because a lot of it now is not he hey come into my law firm office with 50 people and fix my printers. It's like onboard me into Microsoft Office and like all of that stuff can be done remotely. It's a very very digital experience. It's a hundred billion dollar market. Like that's a little bit more interesting because I can actually ingest more clients that way as opposed to I have to buy hundreds of these things. So hopefully that that makes sense.
>> Awesome. All right. Should we switch gears?
>> So so I want to turn it over to Anish because all of these things that we're talking about, they also apply to consumer. Um so um so maybe with that, why don't we talk why and how this applies to consumer.
>> Great. Actually, if we're going to do that, why don't we skip ahead a slide and then we'll come back to this. So, great. So, this is the application of all the categories that Alex outlined to consumer AI. It's it's the exact same pattern. So, the first and very important one is traditional categories are going AI native. This is happening. So, if you look at Photoshop, it's a fantastic business. Well, what do you do if you're a young designer coming up in their career? You want to use the AI native Photoshop. The AI native Photoshop is Korea. That's over 18 months. So it's a fabulous product and it has all the AI primitives built in and it's the one that's being chosen by people that are adopting a first design tool and are early in their career. So this sort of transformation of existing categories is definitely happening. You know the second is category creation. 11 Labs is a fabulous example of this. This sort of market for voice and audio models really didn't exist 5 years ago. There was no I mean perhaps people doing voice actors and voice dictation as a niche market. it just wasn't interesting. 11's done something much more ambitious. They're a model um a model provider and they have both consumer and enterprise SKUs and because they vertically integrate, they're able to really go after this opportunity, create the category in a very short period of time. Finally, proprietary data. Um Alex talked about proprietary data. It's actually near and dear to my heart because I I worked at a large-scale consumer company that was based on proprietary data, which is Credit Karma, for many years. So I I've seen this playbook and it works extraordinarily well. The area that we've actually seen it applied in one of our investments is a company called Slingshot. Slingshot is an AI therapist. How do they collect their proprietary data? Well, they actually go to existing therapists and they provide an AI scribe, a notetaker. And the notetaker takes notes while those therapists counsel their patients. It then uses the generated notes to train a foundation model. And the foundation model trains a consumer product called Ash, which is then um sold directly to consumers. Of course, OpenAI and Chhat GPT are formidable, but they simply don't have the data that Slingshot has. And as a result, Slingshot's able to provide a differentiated and high-priced product and it's working well. So each of the sort of observations Alex made is absolutely playing out in consumer AI and we're very consistent in our um approach to the three. Do you want to go back one? I think this is an important slide as well and an important concept um because a very fair question is well why aren't either labs or um sort of big tech um big tech who have real model efforts like Google going to win it all well the reason is that in many categories being an aggregator of models is actually preferable to consuming just a single model and the metaphor that we're all familiar with here of course is airlines it's much more useful to search for a flight from SF to New York on Kayak because I can look across the inventory of every airline versus just going to Delta United and looking at their inventory alone. The same thing is true in categories like vibe coding or creative tools where you really want access to all of the models. And the reason for that is the models each have their respective specializations. So they're not exact substitutes. You want to work with them all. You want a single pane of glass. And the labs and big tech companies can sort of definitionally only use their own firstparty models. So this is why we see the aggregators winning and it's an important trend and and sort of investing principle for consumer AI. The key thing I mean everybody's heard this this framework before but our job is to find pick and win deals and then once we win deals to help these companies actually achieve their objectives and and most importantly don't screw them up by by giving them bad advice and and telling them what to do. The CEO knows what to do and and we're there to um advise and consent. Um, but the way that we do this is we try to be the leader and the expert on on every market. We're putting out more benchmarks. Like there's actually a really cool benchmark that we're we're coming out with. It's like an AI product AI productivity benchmark. So for all these different categories actually this is pretty cool. So everybody on the team and the way that I would kind of phrase this is we have a process interrupt job. So our interrupt is there's a very very incredible deal. I'm like incredible, incredible, incredible. Like let's go meet with them, drop everything. This is unfortunately from my wife and children's perspective like a weekly occurrence right now where it's like ah got to cancel this. I have to have dinner with this entrepreneur who who has discovered that the fountain not of youth but of you know perpetual emotion um or so they think. Um so go meet with them. That's the interrupt part. The process part is like um you know I'll give you a good example. Uh somebody is going to out Salesforce Salesforce not for the hostages that they have but is going to build the green field version of Salesforce because how is that possible? Everybody hates using Salesforce. there is a new company that's going to do this better that's going to be AI native. Um how do we make sure that we are adept at finding picking and winning and supporting that investment? Well, we believe in adverse selection versus positive selection. So, a very inexpensive deal that has been hanging around the hoop for six months, that's probably bad. We don't want to meet with them. We want to meet with the best company. If it's the best company, every other venture firm also wants to meet with the best company. Obviously, um they're going to send out their big guns to go try to win that deal. And it's very hard to win these great deals. So the best way of starting with this is to write this article and we made a video about this as well which has had like it's hundreds of thousands of views. It's pretty incredible. Death of a Salesforce, why AI will transform sales. Joe Schmidt and Mark Andrusco on our team wrote that. Everybody wants to talk to them. But ultimately knowing what you're talking about really really matters or you know death taxes and AI. We've done we've covered the gamut on everything around taxes. Um what about companionship? What about like we we do something that we just came up with like what are the top 50 enterprise applications, the top 50 consumer applications? You know, we often get a somewhat a porative joke, although I think it's it's a compliment. We're we're a media firm that monetizes with venture capital, but there's a method to this madness and the method is it's helping us find deals, it's helping us pick deals, and it's helping us win deals. So, next um and this is the team that does that. So everybody, you know, again, we've we've got process interrupt. Um, but you know, we have a very very prolific process uh calendar where we're publishing things. We're we're becoming experts in certain categories and trying to find entrepreneurs that are positive selection that are building the best things here and we always see them and like a good example of this is where if you talk to to Nick Cop who's the CEO of um you know Sema and Mark Andrew just knew more about this category. um you know we we were in a very very competitive series B process um yeah I mean so if you look at this uh this chart um so we have a bunch of people like what are the two things that a lot of companies need they're like okay we need help on the accounting side because it's like yeah everybody wants to buy our product I shouldn't say the accounting side but just how do I scale a business and make sure that you know very important revenue is more than expenses and also how do I go build out a sales team and on the other side you have people as I mentioned kind of the content generators So like Mark and Olivia and Joe and Kimberly and Gabe, you know, Kimberly, I'll call her out here. Like um there's a company called Decagon. She introduced the two co-founders. Um Joe has written some great content and has a lot of great people coming to him. We want to make sure that uh if somebody leaves or somebody gets hit by a bus or you know whatever happens, we want to make sure that the entrepreneur experience is very good. If you think about the origin of the firm, the firm originally was the only people that we will have write checks are people that have run a company or started a company. And actually I I joined as part of that that mandate because I you know for better or for worse run a company and started the company. But then we realized that some of the best people to find deals like Olivia is just nonparel in terms of her ability to find great deals and be an expert as I mentioned in voice AI. So it would be insane not to have her who's like the the the front of the spear finding a lot of these great deals to be um working with a lot of these entrepreneurs.
>> Great. Uh the follow on to that question is is there a process in case folks want to check out um what's the process for investment decision-m and and um is the right assumption is that each partner is given a budget to invest rather than needing investment approval or how how has that changed if at all?
>> Yeah, so we we try to be highly highly conviction oriented. Um, and I feel like my job and David's job and Anisha's job is to make sure that the right process is followed because what what the mistake, the automatic mistake of venture capital is I'm old. I don't use social apps. Why would anybody want to send disappearing messages? That's stupid. Let's pass on that deal. And meanwhile, you have like the really really smart not to be agist like 24y old who actually uses this tool every day who knows the entrepreneur and says, "This is the greatest thing that I've ever seen." Um and then the old person, you know, the I'm the old person here, you know, vetos that deal versus the right process is yes, we do have somewhat of a budget. Um and our investment committee is effectively like making sure that we believe very strongly that the process was followed, that you've met every competitor, that the work is topnotch, and we will often defer um to the individual who, you know, is in the arena. Um and our job is to just make sure process and you know, kind of turn that second key. So, it's kind of a it's a it's a two key process and you know again much more convictionoriented. I I know that that doesn't perfectly answer the but we don't have a committee where we everybody votes and then you have to have this many votes and then it's all this political horse trading. It's all right for especially for seeds where a lot of the younger people we have them focused on doing seeds where it's a little bit trickier but for the for the smaller checks which we are predominantly focused on let's just defer to the uh the person with high conviction but make sure that our entire process is done end to end and that this is the expert it came from the content you know what you're talking about and so on and so forth
>> right um may just generally talk about team um evolution and changes how you're thinking about the augmentation of kind of check writers on the team how you are evaluating the path to promotion for folks whether or not you know in light of some of the recent promotions and also evolution of check writers if you will hire any incremental people as well.
>> Yeah, I mean I think the main thing that we often debate about just very candidly is what we want the most is probably more leverage um as opposed to capacity. So we have the capacity to do lots and lots of deals. But if it's the best deal in the world, we need to assume that our counterparty is Rolof at Sequoia or is you know a top partner at Excel or Reed Hoffman at Greylock. Like all of these people are active, but if it's a great deal, the entrepreneur wants to talk to as many people as possible and will often be starruck by the person that started a multi-billion dollar company as as they should. That makes a lot of sense. So um I would say the the one the one area that we might look to add to is you know somebody who probably has built a you know quasi generational company that is still very very hungry as an investor. This is not like you go play this is not a retirement job. This is an anti-retirement job. This will drive somebody crazy to the point where they want to retire because you have to work 20 hours a day sometimes and the working 20 hours a day is something that my my kids make fun of. It's like you just have coffee with people. How is that working? It's like you have to have a lot of coffee. You have to have a very high tolerance for coffee and then you have to switch to alcohol at like 5:00 p.m. It's a lot of work to do this stuff. But you know, joking aside, you really need to be able to meet with everybody and when it is a great like because how do we how do we know like this is the errors of commission versus omission. We need to make sure there are five this actually happened with the ERP space. If we get one of those wrong, not only do we lose our money because we were wrong, but we lose like infinite money because we didn't we didn't actually invest in the right one. So, we have to make sure that we are on top of all of these people and that our team is made up of experts that all of these entrepreneurs want to meet with. So, um I don't know if that that answers your your question, Jen, but um the I think the only thing that I would potentially add is um you know, when it's time to go win a superpower deal, like we all show up together. Um and by the way, like you know, I I jokingly call Mark the Air Force because like if we need a big strike, like we what do we do? We we call in the F-35s. like Mark's got a few of those. We'll have dinner at Mark's house. Ben will show like we all show up beyond just this team. Um but having a few other people that can kind of, you know, lead the charge on winning deals. Um and have board gravitas is helpful. Of course, that is how we use Brian. That is how we use Andy. Like I'm I'm doing that too largely. We want to get as much ownership as possible. And you know, we we might need more people at a senior level not to find the deals, not to pick the deals. Of course, you know, we don't want to just say like, "Hey, you're just a monkey that helps us win deals." But that that is a very very helpful thing to go do. And that's a capacity perspective.
>> By the way, I know it frustrates folks probably on this call to no end because we can't cleanly attribute a certain deal to a certain GP and all all fronts, but hopefully that also represents how much we think about this uh sport as as a team sport and uh one in which we bring the entire you know kind of force of the firm uh to to bear as a part of that. Um, and also just in case people uh did not pick up, Mark does not actually have an F-35, but he's the uh F-35 that comes in to to win deals as a as a part of that. Okay, we uh have two kind of last questions. Maybe we can bundle them together and it this was in reference to um any observations on customer retention to date on AI native companies and then just a scale of spending required for enterprise sales uh for these type of companies. Maybe David or or Anish, you want to take this one? I can talk a little bit about the customer retention point. I mean I we so far we haven't seen a bunch of sort of price shopping and switching and I think it's important that the companies that are selling in the startups that are selling into these companies build a rich software ecosystem around the primitive. This is what David was talking about with voice like it's it's necessary but not sufficient to provide a voice capability. You've got to build a lot of things around that voice capability. So I think one is the companies that are building rich ecosystems have do a better job of retaining their customers. I think the other thing is that AI is moving so quickly. Many of these customers are looking to these startups as their sort of AI solutions provider and they're looking to them for a much more holistic set of things. And because new primitives are being released every day, the startups are kind of helping drive them into the future and um and helping them sort of capture a lot of the topline gains from the new technology. So I'd say so far certainly on the enterprise side retention has not been an issue and then happy to speak to consumer as well where we've also seen strong retention signs.
>> Honestly I don't think we're seeing a tremendous difference from an enterprise sales perspective. I mean if anything we're seeing more inbound than ever. I mean Eve hasn't had to have an outbound motion which is kind of insane uh given you know the scale with which they're operating. Um so there is a lot of sort of market pull for a bunch of these categories but at the limit I think that they will all need you know you know significant kind of enterprise sales and I I think if anything what we're seeing especially when companies are selling to larger corporates is is more of a forward deployed motion on the engineering side. I think many large companies are looking to startups to better understand where and how to apply AI within their organizations. Um and so if anything we're seeing people invest more kind of on the forward deployed engineering side than than necessarily on the sales side.
>> I mean it's a very cultural thing which is um before you hire somebody this is kind of happening in a lot of startups it's not happening at GE can you use AI for this job. In fact you know Ben is the CEO of injuries and horror it's like he's asking that before we hire people here. Um, and I think that mindset actually if you do it correctly, like if you're Eve and you're like, "Oh, I'm just going to hire people that play golf with lawyers and that's my entire sales process and I'll never use AI for anything and I'm just going to use Netswuite and I'm just going to use QuickBooks." Like that that's not how these companies are actually orchestrated. Like they they really they understand the transformative power both on a cost side and a revenue side and they're they're transforming themselves internally.
>> All right, with that note, thank you all for joining and talk to you all soon. Thank you.
>> Thank you.
