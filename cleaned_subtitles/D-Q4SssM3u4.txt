In April this year, the Accounting General Office released the latest statistics on the gap between rich and poor in Taiwan.
Statistics on household wealth distribution in the 110 years of the Republic of China
The wealth of the top 20% of households is about 51.33 million yuan
The wealth of the bottom 20% of households is only about 770,000 yuan
The gap between rich and poor is as high as 66.9 times
over the past 40 years
GDP of countries around the world continues to grow
But many people feel that their quality of life has declined
The gap between rich and poor is widening
Politicians don’t listen to public opinion
This resulted in angry crowds all over the world
Demonstrations and attempts to use votes to remove certain political parties
Why is the country getting richer and richer, but people’s lives getting harder and harder?
The book I’m going to face today is “The Economics of Anger”
Let’s understand why capitalism makes more and more people angry
The author of this book is American international economist Mark Blyth
In this book he talks to a hedge fund manager
Unraveling the evolution of capitalism over the past hundred years
It can be seen as a dialogue between the left and the right
Finally, we propose a solution that transcends the left and right factions.
First, let’s define what anger economics is
We can differentiate between some legitimate anger
Some anger is irrational
Aristotle said
"We applaud a person who is angry for the right reasons and against the right people."
For example, public moral outrage is justified
Because it reveals the collective moral consciousness
For example, after the 2008 financial crisis
The global economy is being brought down by Wall Street bankers
But political policymakers bailed out the banks
And in turn, they blame the public and say
It was you who borrowed money from the bank to buy a house you couldn't afford.
You should blame yourselves
This triggered the anger of people around the world
This anger is justified
Because it exposes vulnerabilities in the economic system
The anger must be heard
Only capitalism can repair its mistakes
Or after the Panama Papers were revealed in 2017
Everyone found that big companies and wealthy people evaded taxes
Angry people in many countries demand politicians to step down
Because tax evasion violates social ethics
It's morally wrong for rich people not to pay taxes
He will leave the country without funds to maintain social operations
And the yellow vest movement in France in 2019
It was Macron who ignored public opinion and resolutely raised fuel taxes
sparked dissatisfaction among French workers
We found that over the past 20 years
There are more and more scandals and social movements exposing the corruption of today’s economic system
The author believes that behind these anger
Reflects that the public has lost confidence in capitalism
But politicians don’t deal with it
Rather, it uses public anger to inflame voters.
Talk about which political party should be removed from power
This prevents people from discussing the really important issues:
Such as salary structure, housing justice, wealth inequality
For example, the Brexit issue has paralyzed British political debate for three years.
All focus shifts to Brexit
This way people don’t realize the inherent problems of capitalism
Thinking that as long as another political party comes to power, the problem will be solved
Cover up what is happening by blaming other parties
So now the author wants to face it head on
He said capitalism is like a computer
Now this computer has a bug and crashes
It means there is a compatibility issue between hardware and software.
We can't keep it running with some little patch software
Instead, you should change to a new operating system
Then the author will make a diagnosis of capitalism
Revisiting the development of capitalism over the past 100 years
Every time capitalism encounters a crisis
will cause public anger
And anger is exactly the turning point that allows capitalism to renew
over the past 100 years
Capitalism has gone through three stages
The first stage is liberal capitalism from the 1870s to the 1930s
liberalism believes
In a free market, both employers and workers will find the position that best suits their own interests.
Therefore, the market will automatically allocate the supply, demand and price of capital and labor.
This is called "market clearing"
So if someone is unemployed or low paid
This is all determined by the market mechanism
If the state attempts to intervene in the market and help the poor
On the contrary, it will disrupt market operations and bring counterproductive effects.
This version of capitalism 1.0 worked until World War I but crashed
In 1929, the Great Depression occurred in Europe and the United States, and millions of workers lost their jobs.
At that time, most economists believed
This is only a short-term phenomenon
The free market will correct these problems automatically
But as a result, the unemployment problem has not disappeared
leading to mass dissatisfaction
At that time, European governments shifted public anger to other scapegoats.
Not to face it is a symptom of capitalism failing
Like the rise of fascism in Germany
It’s the state taking advantage of the people’s anger
Defenders of capitalism like to say:
"In the long run, the market mechanism will automatically correct the unemployment problem."
But Keynes, the economist at the time, said ironically:
"In the long run, we are all dead."
If the government is not allowed to intervene in the free market
Then the free market will kill people first
But why didn’t Capitalism 1.0 realize this?
Economic historian Karl Polanyi pointed out
This is because there is an essential difference between capitalism and market transactions.
That is, it requires the state to construct "fictitious commodities": such as labor, land, capital
What does "labor is a fictitious commodity" mean?
in the labor market
The employer can buy your labor force at any price
For investors
Labor force is simply the number of employees
It's just a number on the salary table
But workers are self-aware and human beings
People will want the value of their labor to rise rather than fall
In comparison
A cow has no self-awareness
He doesn't care if his value goes up or down
If you lower the price of a cow and sell it to someone else,
This cow won't protest that you're trampling on my humanity.
But if capitalists lower labor wages
Workers will protest and be angry
these actions
It may in turn endanger the interests of the employer
We must hold the gavel of the people's will
Go and smash Mr. Krabs's terrifying thief's den
Supporting the strike makes me so hungry
Friends, let’s go eat delicious crab patties together
The more management wants to treat labor as a commodity
Any salary reduction
The more he will discover that labor is different from other commodities
Because workers may not be able to bear it and fight back
You can organize a trade union to demand a salary increase
Or ask the country to raise the minimum wage
Therefore, "labor is a fictitious commodity" will be exposed
People will demand state action to protect labor rights
For example, Roosevelt's New Deal in the United States is an example
People demand that the government protect workers from the abuses of the capitalist market
After the crisis of capitalism 1.0
Because of the rise of fascism
And World War II
Let many people realize that version 1.0 has too many bugs
So the economist Keynes proposed a new theory
Let’s upgrade capitalism to version 2.0
Keynes said
when the great depression happened
No investor will be willing to invest money
Therefore, the government must intervene in market investment at this time
This government investment won't just help the unemployed
And it’s a signal to investors
Let them regain their confidence
Willing to invest money to enter the market
Government investment is key to stabilizing market demand and avoiding the decline of capitalism
So in the 30 years from 1945 to 1975
European and American countries have entered Capitalism 2.0
The government vigorously intervenes in the market to maintain full employment and increase wages.
During this period, trade unions were powerful and bargaining with employers was the norm.
The fruits of GDP growth can be distributed more equitably to labor
Therefore, if the employer wants to increase profits
Cannot deduct employee salaries or reduce personnel costs
We must find ways to increase production capacity
When a company increases its profits
Workers will also get more
When labor wages rise
You will also pay more taxes and consume more
The government can collect more taxes
Can be invested in medical care, education, and public construction
people will live better
Therefore, the overall GDP growth will trigger a positive cycle
That's why 30 years after the war
Western countries were able to move to a postwar welfare state
Stable economic growth and improved social welfare
French national income triples
The American middle class has grown significantly
A large number of public housing is being built in the UK
By 1973, the ratio of U.S. labor income to GDP reached its peak.
It was at this stage that the "post-war baby boomers" enjoyed various dividends of the times.
Arguably the healthiest period of capitalism
Because it has learned the lessons of Capitalism 1.0
But version 2.0 also has bugs after 30 years of operation.
Economist Michal Kalecki pointed out
Keynesian policies can maintain long-term stable employment rates
Although it will bring about a positive cycle of wages
But rising wages hurt ROI
Again, with full national benefits
An incompetent person can suddenly say he doesn't want to work and go on strike.
Anyway, social welfare is good
You can always find a job or support the government
Then the company must give higher wages
To retain talents
But if wages keep rising
people have more money to go shopping
will cause the value of the commodity to rise accordingly
That is, inflation will occur
And when an economy experiences inflation
Investors must expect higher investment returns in the future
to offset the losses caused by inflation
This will lead to a decrease in investment willingness
So Keynes's model developed to the end
There will be "Stagflation"
Michal Kalecki predicted this in 1943
As a result, in the 1970s
This prophecy came true
In order to deal with this problem, Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time,
raise bank interest rates
Make it difficult for companies to borrow money from banks
In this way, companies must reduce manpower requirements
leading to increased unemployment and lower labor wages
This will curb inflation
But this is only a short-term emergency measure
Dealing with the bugs of Capitalism 2.0
Long-term measures are needed
So starting in the 1980s
Capitalism has been upgraded to version 3.0
Capitalism 2.0 gives workers stability after 30 years
Stagnant inflation emerged in the 1970s
At this moment
Big corporate capitalists and political groups in Europe and the United States
It was in this crisis that we found a turning point in transforming capitalism.
Economists Milton Friedman and Hayek at the time
Conceived of a version of Capitalism 3.0
called neoliberalism
The goal is to maintain low inflation and stable prices at all costs
Prevent version 2.0 errors from happening again
But you need to upgrade the software to 3.0
The hardware must also change
That means changing the system
First, we must prevent workers from having too much power to demand higher wages.
So in the 1980s
Mrs. Thatcher in the UK vigorously attacked the power of trade unions
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Won’t you negotiate with these strikers? </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Will you not negotiate with them ever?</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>I will never negotiate with people who use coercion and violence to achieve their objective. <font color=#FFDC00FF>I will never negotiate with people
who use coercion and violence to achieve their objective. /font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They are the enemies of democracy . </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They are the enemies of democracy. </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They are not
interested in the future of democracy.</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They
are trying to kill democracy for their own purposes.</font>
Many U.S. businesses are relocating to non-union states
If workers don’t have the right to ask their bosses for a raise
Then you don’t have to worry about wages rising too fast and causing inflation.
The more critical hardware upgrade is to open up the global financial market.
In version 2.0 of capitalism
In order to fully employ domestic workers,
The state will ensure that capital investment is domestic
If you are an investor after World War II
Your capital can only be invested in domestic companies
So if any company in the country goes on strike
Will directly threaten the interests of the employer
Therefore, the employer is more likely to make concessions
But version 3.0 of capitalism removes financial regulations
Claiming to make capital more efficient
Investment should not be limited to domestic
Capitalists should be allowed to invest in countries with the highest returns
So in 1994 NAFTA was established
<font color=#FFE400FF>In an economy
where competition is global and change is the only constant, </font> <font color=#FFE400FF>In an economy where competition is global and change is the only constant, </font> >
<font color=#FFE400FF>We must ensure that American workers can survive safely</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>we simply cannot advance the security of American workers </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>We cannot build walls of protection around our economy </font> <font color=#FFE400FF>by building walls
of protection around our economy </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>or
by pretending that global competition isn't there. </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Our only choice is to take this new
world head on.</font>
China joined the WTO in 2001
<font color=#FFE900FF>I represent the Chinese government</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Express gratitude to the WTO Ministerial Conference for its decision on China’s accession to the WTO</font>
liberalization of these trades
Free capital from the constraints of national borders
Capital can circulate freely
But workers are locked inside the country
This has a consequence
In version 2.0
Employers will be worried about domestic labor strikes
But in version 3.0
The employer doesn’t have to worry anymore
Because investment and factory establishment are all done abroad.
Domestic workers will lose a lot of job opportunities
This arouses the anger of the lower-class workers
For example, Wisconsin in the United States
Lost a third of its industry in the past 30 years
Industries are moving to other countries
This was originally a strong vote area for the Democratic Party.
In the 2016 election, he switched to supporting Trump.
Because at that time Trump promised to cooperate with Hon Hai and Foxconn
Bring these lost jobs back to America
<font color=#FFF700FF>Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire, and develop than the United States</font> <font color=#FFF700FF>Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire
, and grow than right here in the United States.</font>
As a result, even after being elected, the promise was not fulfilled.
Instead, it made local residents even angrier.
<font color=#FFF200FF>
My predecessor came to Racine with a promise of, quote,</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Reclaiming our country's proud manufacturing legacy.</font> <font color=#FFF200FF>reclaiming our
country's proud manufacturing legacy.</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Well, we had 'Infrastructure Day' every… week for four years, </font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Nothing was built in the end</font> <font color=#FFF200FF>didn't build a damn thing
.</font>
This also creates capitalism 3.0 and 2.0 versions, two different career paths.
In the 2.0 period
Post-war baby boomers can learn a skill and live a stable life
But in version 3.0
Capitalist globalization has caused fierce competition since the 1980s
Contracts can be outsourced to cheaper labor
Companies begin to prefer short-term contracts and the gig economy
No one knows how long the next contract will last after their contract expires.
Capitalism 3.0 has developed so far
Three big problems have arisen
The first is income inequality
Since the 1980s
The income growth of the top 1% is equivalent to that of the bottom 50% combined
Neoliberalism would argue
In the long run, capitalism can bring about a "trickle-down" effect
The fruits of growth can improve the living standards of all people
Even the lowest income will increase
So inequality is allowed
Because the overall economy has indeed grown
It’s just that the people at the top get more, and the people at the bottom get less.
But research finds that the "trickle-down effect" does not occur
Since the 1980s
U.S. GDP continues to rise
But workers’ real wages have been stagnant for 40 years
In Taiwan, before 2002, GDP growth would drive wage growth.
But since 2002, GDP has continued to grow, but real wages have stagnated.
Taiwan begins to repeat the development trajectory of the United States
This is the second bug of Capitalism 3.0: real wage stagnation
Here comes the problem
If people's wages are frozen, all the wealth created will flow to the employer
So how do people go to college, buy a car, buy a house?
very simple
Capitalism creates massive bank loans
If you can't make money, you can borrow money from the bank
So from 1980 to 2000
Consumer credit in European and American countries is expanding at twice the rate of income growth
Banks make money
Encourage everyone to borrow more money, regardless of the borrower's repayment ability
This results in banks taking too much risk
The result was the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, which brought capitalism 3.0 to its knees.
after the financial tsunami
Governments only address bugs in banking systems
But the other two bugs still exist
Income inequality and stagnant wages prove that capitalism is broken
This is why young people are so angry about capitalism
Because the sense of generational deprivation is too strong
What the postwar baby generation inherited from the previous generation was Capitalism 2.0
That is, the welfare state period in Europe and the United States
You can enjoy free college, cheap housing, and medical care
You can accumulate assets by working hard
You can also inherit your parents’ inheritance
But the young people of the Millennial generation
Inherited Capitalism 3.0 from birth
That is neoliberalism
no union power
Must pay high student loans
There are also housing prices that are unaffordable
The post-war baby generation was born simple
But the Millennium era has been in difficult mode since it was born
50% of the wealth in the United States today is owned by postwar baby boomers
In other words, people aged 60-80 control most of the country’s wealth.
This creates a vicious cycle
If assets are highly concentrated in the elderly
Young people have no money
Then there is no spending power
But if no one consumes, the economy will not be active.
Young people still have to pay student loans and taxes on their salary.
Used to pay post-war baby boom retirees
Obviously these old people are the richest
Then politicians will pander to the votes of the wealthy class
And the wealthy class are all old people
It's like the old man dominates the country's political system
It is even less possible to implement policies that are beneficial to young people.
For example, Trump helped cut taxes for the wealthy by $1.5 trillion
Most of these rich people are old people
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Dear young people</font> <font color=#FFEC00FF>Dear young people </font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>
Don't vote.</font> <font color=#FFEC00FF>Don't vote.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Trump was us.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Trump. That was us.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>He's our guy .</font> <font color=#FFEC00FF>He's our guy
.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Reducing taxes for the rich? </font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Tax cuts for the rich?</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>hell yeah, i'm rich as fuck.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>hell yeah, i'm rich as fuck.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Climate change? </font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Climate change?</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>That's a you problem .</font> <font color=#FFEC00FF>That's a you problem
.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>I'll be dead soon.</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>I'll be dead soon.</font>
Finally, after these old people pass away,
They will leave their inheritance to their children
The rich second generation is born in a simple mode
In comparison
Young people without inheritance must take out loans to buy cars and houses
will allow the inequalities of capitalism to be passed on to the next generation.
So economist Piketty said
Today’s world is a kind of “hereditary capitalism”
Capitalist inequality stems from cross-generational inequality
Some people win when they are reincarnated into the right family.
But this deviates from the "free market and fair competition" promised by capitalism.
But now governments don't face people's anger
Instead, they transfer their anger to other victims.
Just like what happened when the crisis of Capitalism 1.0 happened
For example, those who support Brexit in the UK are usually from rural areas.
because they saw a lot of Eastern European immigrants moving in
Then farm work wages dropped.
Make the locals feel like my life is getting worse
Because they moved in
same
Recently, in order to deal with the problem of labor shortage, the Taiwan government has opened the door for Indian workers to come to Taiwan.
triggered a backlash from many people
At this time the focus will be shifted to say:
If you object, you are discriminating against Indians
But if you listen carefully to these objections
What many people are protesting is that the government does not improve the salary structure
I just want to go to other countries to find cheaper labor
To listen to the reasons for people’s anger
we will find
What is reflected behind the scenes is the bug of Capitalism 3.0
Taiwan’s GDP grows every year
Wages have stagnated for 20 years
Now we have to go to other countries to introduce cheaper labor
The public's anger is certainly justified
After reviewing the three stages of development of capitalism,
Finally, the author will propose several solutions to eliminate the bugs of Capitalism 3.0
When many economists refer to wealth inequality
Will propose taxation
For example, Piketty proposed a “global wealth tax”
Or during the 2020 US election
Senator Warren proposes wealth tax on the super rich
<font color=#FFFD00FF>This is
a wealth tax that has been needed for a long time.</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>We have watched the wealth of the billionaire class
in America</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>increase
by more than a trillion dollars over the last year.</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>A two percent wealth tax would just help level the playing field a little bit</font> <font color=#FFFD00FF>
a two cent wealth tax would just help level the playing field a little bit</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>and create the kind of revenue that would let us build back better.</font> <font color=#FFFD00FF>and create
the kind of revenue that would let us build back better.</font>
But these proposals are unrealistic
Because rich people have money and can bribe politicians
It's impossible to get these bills passed
And the rich all know how to avoid taxes
You can't find out where their money is hidden.
So there must be something more radical than taxation
The author proposes three options
The first is to set up a national wealth fund
This is similar to the "sovereign wealth funds" established by Singapore, Norway, and Arab oil-producing countries.
These countries export far more than they import
There is a huge foreign exchange surplus every year
The money is invested by the government
make more money
For example, Norway’s sovereign fund bought shares of TSMC
Then use the money to pay citizens’ pensions and pensions
To maintain high welfare policy
But that's because Norway has oil so it can do this.
What do countries without crude oil do?
The National Wealth Fund is a similar program
Governments can issue bonds at zero interest rates
Because rich countries around the world are becoming older
The elderly tend to avoid risks
So for the elderly
Bonds are the safest option
Because it is guaranteed by the state
The government can then use the money it gets from selling the bonds
Go for a portfolio with a higher yield
Then every once in a while
After the government repays the bonds
The surplus generated will become the public wealth of the country.
The government can allocate money to households with the least assets in the country
Let the poor start to have a fixed asset
Or spend the money on education, housing, and medical care
This way people don’t have to worry about not being able to afford basic expenses
It is equivalent to restoring the high social welfare of Capitalism 2.0
Can effectively calm people’s anger
simply put
The National Wealth Fund is the government’s investment
The money earned is used to take care of the low-paid people in society
implement social welfare
Let every citizen become a shareholder
So the National Wealth Fund is kind of like universal basic income.
The state of Alaska in the United States established a permanent fund in 1976
$1,600 per resident per year
This kind of state-owned fund can solve the problem of "where does the money come from" when facing universal basic income?
The second solution to deal with inequality is "data dividend"
Many people who oppose universal basic income would say
If you can get something for nothing
Then no one will want to work
Anyway, if you act useless at home, the government will give you money
Now the author says
Users of technology products can charge a "data bonus" fee from technology companies
Because when we use Google, Facebook, various social media
Technology companies can monitor and track our data
Then sell this information to advertisers to make money
They can also use this data to upgrade their algorithms
Therefore, each user is like the raw material for the company to make money.
Companies take raw materials from us
Shouldn't you have to pay for it?
If you create something today
Another person takes it directly
We would consider this theft.
When we use technology
In fact, I am also creating
Create our search articles and information about ourselves
Therefore, the ownership of the materials we produce belongs to us.
If technology companies want to use user information to make money
Then we should be entitled to receive a data bonus
<font color=#FFF500FF>Many of our tech giants are
paying 0 and near 0 taxes.</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>
And they're selling and reselling our data for tens of billions of dollars.< /font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>The biggest winners in the 21st century economy are not actually sharing those winnings with
the rest of us .</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>That's
what I'm going to change as president.</font>
The third and final idea is
Establish an independent fiscal council
This fiscal meeting is like an automatic stabilizer
Can decide in advance if financial problems arise
How to reduce taxes and increase government spending
Instead of waiting for the government to respond promptly when an economic recession occurs
This meeting must be independent
How to allocate government budget expenditures
So that they won’t be controlled by political parties
For example, many European countries implemented austerity policies after the European debt crisis in 2011.
leading to a reduction in public welfare
Many Europeans are angry
If there is an independent fiscal meeting
This wrong decision might never have happened in the first place
In today’s episode we introduce the Economics of Anger
over the past 100 years
Capitalism encounters three failures
Each crash resulted in massive public outrage.
Also brings new software upgrades
Today we are in the third crisis
The gap between rich and poor continues to widen
Wage stagnation for 20 years
We are therefore justified in being angry at the system
We can set up a national wealth fund to reduce the gap between rich and poor
Use data dividends to fight against technology companies using our information for free
Establish an independent fiscal council as a stabilizer for economic downturns
All three proposals respond to today’s anger against capitalism
Not as difficult to implement as a rich tax or universal basic income
Rather, it is a solution that can be achieved within the system.
As long as capitalism continues to fail
Continued widening of inequality and low wages
Anger economics will appear again and again
Until the system hears people's angry voices
