[Music] hi everyone I'm thrilled to be here with Yen stoltenberg who just finished off uh as the Secretary General in NATO and before NATO he was the Prime Minister of Norway warm welcome y thank you so much for having me so I'm having here um you know a book which uh you wrote uh which came out 8 years ago which basically covered the period until 10 years ago and it's got a beautiful picture of you on the on the front here um but just what are the what are the most important changes in the world since that book came out the most important changes at least related to my task my responsibilities in NATO is that uh the world has become more dangerous the good that's the bad news the good news is that NATO has become stronger to protect close to 1 billion people um um of course there are many other changes but but but seen from a security perspective we have now a fullscale war in Europe uh we we have uh uh a new very devastating conflict in the Middle East risk of escalation and we have significantly more Global rivalry between great Powers United States China um uh and then we have cyber hybrid terrorist threats as a constant threat to our security so so fundamentally we live in a more unpredictable more uh uh dangerous world than we have done for decades M if we um cover some of these points there so so how do you think the Ukraine situation will end what's the most likely Wars are by Nature extremely unpredictable and predictable so therefore I will be very careful predicting how that will end um but um um of course we all want this war to end the challenge is that uh the quickest way to end a war is to lose a war uh but that will not lead to peace that will lead to occupation of Ukraine and Ukraine will not be a sovereign independent Democratic nation in Europe and it will be a country controlled by by Moscow so if you want the war to end in a way where millions of ukrainians still can live in a free Democratic Society then we need to convince President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield that he has to sit down and negotiate agree uh a solution where Ukraine uh can still be a sovereign uh Democratic nation and I don't believe that we can change Putin's mind but I think we can change his calculus meaning that I don't think we can change his ambition his goal of trying to control Ukraine but I think that by providing Military Support to Ukraine we can um ensure that the cost of achieving that goal for Russia is so high that they will accept a solution where Ukraine prevails in one way or another the decision of um not giving uh more offensive weapons which was uh kind of renewed lately what do you think about that well Al NATO allies have delivered a lot of also offensive weapons the reality is that of course we have gradually changed uh uh um over the years I remember when I came to Nato in 2014 then some allies United States United Kingdom um uh uh a couple of other Canada they provided some Military Support some some training but hardly any little uh weapons uh it was a big discussion for instance about uh javelins the anti-tank weapons which has Pro extremely important on the battlefield in Ukraine and I think actually we should have done more before the fullscale invasion in 2022 um but after 2022 the full scale Invasion NATO allies have delivered much more Military Support than President Putin expected and to be honest also we expected um we had big discussions on whether we were going to deliver battle tanks now allies deliver a lot of advanced modern battle tanks including us Abrams Tanks European or German leopard tanks um we deliver Advanced Air Defense systems Patriots we deliver uh long range artillery also cruise missiles uh from for instance United Kingdom and France and then also f-16s so the the scale and the quality of this Military Support is much bigger than anyone was able to foresee uh just a couple of years ago uh I think the The Dilemma which has which continues to be discussed among allies is to what extent will should we allow Ukraine to use all these weapons against military targets inside Russia and allies have different policy some NATO allies have said uh there are no restrictions um except for uh also adhering to international law uh others have imposed some restrictions on the use of uh weapons deep into Russia what do you think I think we need to remember what this is that this is a war aggression Russia has attacked another country that's a blatant violation of international law um according to international law Ukraine has the right for self-defense uh self-defense includes the right to strike legitimate military Targets on the territory of the aggressor meaning Russia so therefore I have argued for uh loosening up these restrictions uh and uh many allies have done so and then there is a ongoing conversation among NATO allies exactly to what extent they should remove all the restrictions uh uh um when it comes to hitting legitimate military targets under territor if uh Ukraine have to recede more territory is that more likely to happen you think I'm extremely careful even though I'm now stepped down as secret General to to to a way to to speculate because it can be self-fulfilling prophecies if you start to say that we believe that Ukraine has to do this and that or seed more territory then of course it can boost R the morale of the Russians and reduce the moral morale of the ukrainians and even though I know that I'm not speaking on behalf of NATO anymore I think it matters what we all say uh when it comes to what we believe that Ukraine uh also may be forced to um fundamentally it is only the ukrainians that can decide uh what are acceptable conditions they are paying the highest price they are sacrificing people uh uh every day to to fight for their freedom and again I think that the path to peace is to convince Putin that he cannot win on the battlefield uh there is a very close relationship between what happens on the battlefield and what can happen around the negotiating table so if you want some kind of acceptable solution where Ukraine will remain as a independent nation then military strength on the battlefield is the way to convince Putin that that he has to accept that then of course it's for the ukrainians to decide uh how much they are willing to to give up to to to achieve peace I I've met many Finnish politicians of the last couple of years since fin now had joined NATO I think we even have the president in Oso today yeah yeah you're absolutely right and um and I and Alex St the president of uh of Finland uh um they always or they often and and many other finish politicians have have in a way shared with us the the history of Finland um it's different from Ukraine but there are there are some parallels they were invaded by the Red Army in 1939 um and they were able to as a small country to to to inflict much more heavy losses uh and pain on the invading Russian or Soviet forces so the Red Army didn't achieve their goals but to end the war Finland had to accept to give up to seed roughly 10% of their territory and their second biggest city vorg which is now part of Russia MH uh but of course uh in return they gained borders and security that has lasted for decades um I'm not saying that this is the parallel for ukra and a NATO membership a NATO membership what's been the most important advice you've given your successor Mark R first of all I I've been very careful giving any advice because I I I I just don't think that you know people are leaving a position should be to especially not in public to explicit on advice and so on I have great trust in Mar he's a great leader he has been prime minister for I think it's 14 years uh and of course just to lead coalitions to find compromises I think is the best way to qualify to become a Secret General NATO to to to know how to to to reconcile different views um but but I I cannot hide that of course the most important task for any Secor General NATO is to keep this big uh uh family uh together yeah and we are 32 allies uh and we don't always agree on all issues so his main task is to ensure that despite these differences that we are able to u to to Rally around the core task to protect and defend each other you have um over the last few years become more vocal about China um what are the concerns you have first I would like to say that if you instance read that book uh so M I read it twice yeah yeah love it I I I I know I was a great believer in China for many years um and I was EXT extremely impressed I I remember I visited China Al in 85 or ' 86 Le middle of the ' 80s and I was extremely impressed um by the changes that Ding did and how they were opening up their economy uh how the economic growth of China changed the world partly for the people in China uh lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty but also actually important for the rest of the world uh by creating a big New Market by by by providing lot of products uh to the global economy Norway benefited we sold a lot of energy oil gas uh into the Chinese market or Global Market uh and then we bought a lot of uh things from China good price uh so that has been a great success story for China and for the rest of the world um uh then I can not say exactly when My Views started to change but I remember I was very disappointed the way China re reacted when the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize committee awarded the Peace Prize to a Chinese disident I think it was in 2010 and then they actually imposed heavy sanctions against Norway and behaved very they wanted us to apologize uh and and that behavior was quite shocking and then of course after I arrived in NATO and over the last years we have seen a much more assertive China trying to dominate control the South China Sea uh they have lost actually in the international Court in the hog so what they do there is a violation of international law threatening neighbors um threatening Taiwan uh and China is investing heavily in new Advanced weapons including nuclear weapons um without any transparency and then of course in Ukraine what we see there is that security is not uh Regional security is global because China is the main enabler of Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine uh by providing the uh micro Electronics the components for Russians to build the bombs and the missiles they're using uh in Ukraine so the Clos and closer alignment between Russia and China Al of course is one of the reasons why we are concerned let me add one more thing and that is that CH we don't Al when I was Secretary General NATO I remember very well that we didn't we didn't say that China is an enemy or an adversary we need to engage with China on issues related to climate change they have to be part of the global economy of course uh and and um in the future hopefully also arms control but we but we have to be not it's important that we're not naive and not make the same mistakes as we did for instance when it comes to Russia being over dependent on gas from Russia we should not be over dependent on specific Commodities or technology from China the fact that there are stronger and stronger links between the autocrats in the world what are the what are the implications for the Western world that we have to be uh together when we see that the autocrats are more and more aligned and then of course that's partly we meaning partly NATO allies so 32 Nations on the both sou Atlantic but also with other countries which at least don't to be don't want to be part of kind of autocratic Alliance and again Ukraine is perhaps the the clear example Russia is responsible for war aggression the main providers of weapons uh and and enablers of that war is North Korea uh Iran and China uh and uh and and this is not rhetoric this is this is this is real and makes a difference on the battlefield and we also also see how Russia and China are exercise you more together um also around Japan uh um uh and know parts of the world so so this is really a global picture that makes it even more important that of course NATO allies stand together but also that we work with Partners all around the world including South Korea Japan and many other countries how do you read them the activities around Taiwan just now well I we see that China again and again repeat uh different threats uh both in rhetoric but also with these very high-profile uh uh exercises we actually exercising how to invade Taiwan and that will be uh extremely dangerous and uh and the rhetoric is is dangerous therefore it is important that we that military force is not used to change status quo uh in and around Taiwan uh there are millions of people living there um uh NATO allies recognize that uh and and Norway uh recognize that there's one China uh but but we also uh support the idea of people having the right to live in a democratic and opposite Society we had the same idea with Hong Kong that was two systems in one nation that Hong Kong should be some kind of democratic part of China uh that didn't last for very long and of course it will be a trategy of millions of people living in Taiwan experien something similar to what the people of Hong Kong has experienced over the last years how should the Business Leaders and we as investors think about engaging with China this is extremely difficult question uh but I think just to be aware Ware that there are dilemas and to be conscious uh about those dilemas helps uh uh I I have been and I continue to be a strong believer in free trade and most of my political life I really worked for free trade agreements including uh the open European market and I believe that globalization free trade benefits us all having said that freedom is more important than free trade and sometimes you have to recognize that you cannot have free trade if it uh if the cost is that you actually undermine freedom and one example is Russian gas uh until 2022 many European governments meant that buying gas from Russia was a commercial issue it it it was not a political issues polit politicians should stay out of a commercial deal between commercial companies in Europe with commercial companies in in Russia that proved very wrong because to buy gas from Russia is not a commercial issue at least much more than a commercial issue it it was it was a security vulnerability that that Russia utilized after uh the full scale Evas of Ukraine they tried to cerse European allies from supporting Ukraine by using the gas and we should not repeat the same mistakes with uh with uh with China it's quite amazing that we ended up in that situation actually with uh Russian gas yeah yeah it wasn't amazing but I think we need to remember that it was quite common European view that that we that that trade with that all kind of trade with Russia was a good thing and again I have been partly part of that that view I have been in favor of trade with Russia I've been in favor of trade with China with very little restrictions then gradually I I I saw how especially Russia but also to some extent China has used trade as a political tool and therefore the politicians have responsibilities to put in some regulations laws uh to ensure that we don't make the really big mistakes but within those regulations there has to also be judgment by each and individual private commercial company and and the Dilemma is that the the extremes will not work we cannot have absolutely open and free trade there has to be some security uh uh considerations uh part of those decisions uh but on the other hand we cannot isolate China so to find this balance where we have some trade some uh economic relations but without making ourself too vulnerable I I cannot give the exact answer but the dialogue between governments uh companies on how to find this balance is the B way best way to try to at least find the best way forward together last Hotpot uh Middle East how do you think that will play out it's difficult to predict Ukraine even harder to predict the Middle East uh and um what we see now is a trategy um um it's dangerous um and there is risk of further escalation uh and especially with Iran uh which has de stabilized the region for many years and continue to do so um as a norian I think it's important to remember that in 1993 we had the Osa Accord which has been heavily criticized since for many years but I still believe that that's in a way the only way that can create some kind of lasting solution and that's a two-state solution you need a state for the Israelis and you need a Palestinian or state for the pal Palestinians it's not easy but the alternative to continue as we do now is absolutely not viable uh so therefore sometimes crisis creates the momentum to find new Solutions uh and hopefully at least one thing that can come out of what we see in the Middle East now is a renewed effort to uh find a two-state solution there are some voices that want the EU to play a more important part in defense policy what is your view on that my view is that if it's done in the right way is very good if it's done in the wrong way it's very bad uh so what's the right way and the right way is that EU should do more and they and and they have started to step up uh when it comes to for instance strengthening the defense industry meaning uh overcoming the fragmentation of the European Defense industry um to increase defense spending uh and to and to in general strengthen European uh uh uh defenses meaning that that that will also strengthen NATO um uh 96% of the people living in the European Union they live in a NATO country so that will be more or less the same what is not good is to create alternative and competing structures uh and to and to underpin the idea of Eur the European Union uh defending Europe but can you see that some people are in favor of this given the US position yes but I think that's that's dangerous I I I I think that any uh attempt to in a way uh split or divide Europe from North America will undermine our security because we live in a more dangerous world and and if we go alone we will be weaker and more vulnerable um and the European Union cannot defend uh Europe um 80% of NATO's defense expenditure comes from non-eu NATO allies that's of course United States but also Canada a big Ally uh uh the United Kingdom the second biggest defense spender in uh in in NATO uh but also uh this is about geography turkey in in the South extremely important for fighting Isis fighting terrorism bordering Iraq and uh and Syria in the north Norway in Iceland perhaps not the biggest NATO allies but very important for the transatlantic link for so so so geography and resources makes it clear that this idea that EU should develop some kind of independent defense will just undermine uh and duplicate uh the NATO structures and the NATO structures has to North America and Europe together uh is the only way to defend uh Europe we are together we are 50% of the world's military might and 50% of the world's uh economic Mar so as long as we stand together North americ Europe will be safe good space yeah cor lot of issues yeah well there are so the world is so complex right it is it is what's going on in space from a Warfare point of view so first I think what we see is that is more and more weaponization of space and and what happens in space space matters more and more for uh what's going on on the earth that's obvious for communications GPS cyber and then of course targeting a lot of military operations in Ukraine are dependent on satellites in in in space and and any future conflict space uh will be important uh what we also then see is that again Russia and China are developing capabilities that can actually be used as offensive weapons uh and this is a dangerous uh uh um development and again the there's a need for transparency there is a need for uh Arms Control uh and there is a need also for for allies and partners to stand together to address these issues together in a way a bit related to that AI what are the issues surrounding that when it comes to Warfare some people uh in America say that we should build AI into everything we do into all the weapons all the cars everything right to beat the Chinese in this kind of fight what how do you see AI impact Warfare also I I have to admit that I have read and and listened to many experts uh explaining about Ai and and and I still struggle to fully understand the full implications but I think what is obvious that AI has and will even more so in the future change nature of warfare uh perhaps as fundamental as the Industrial Revolution did because you have to understand that if you go to if you go to the from from from from cesa to Napoleon the soldiers could actually participate the the the the soldiers participating uh in the Roman Empire or part of the Roman Empire they could actually make a difference on the battlefield uh during the napic War uh because they had they had the technology that actually was applicable also at that time then from napic war to the first world everything first world war everything changed with the Industrial Revolution being Al then implemented into Warfare I think we see something similar now uh a fundamental shift where we don't ful understand but but but autonomous systems uh facial recognition um drones cyber attacks by using also AI is has the potential of changing Warfare so much that it's very hard to fully uh understand uh the full implications we have SE we have already seen it on the battlefield in uh Ukraine yeah um it's not the secret that some of the drones and the surveillance systems that NATO operates also uses AI uh to process information so this is a this has already started but we only seen the beginning of a fundamental change of the natural Warfare interestingly the two uh Nobel prizes that were won over the last week in chemistry and physics uh you know have ai underpinnings so it is really changing uh a lot of things um but the fact that uh we regul AI so much in Europe is that holding back our defense capabilities so far I've not heard the defense industry complaining about that but but it maybe uh and um and and I think the challenge the dilemas every time we we we approach new technologies is that in one way we want ethical standards we want transparency we want regulations to prevent the misuse of important technology on the other hand if we only impose restrictions on ourselves being Europe or or or North American Europe Western Alliance but but but our adversaries they have no restrictions then of course we can just make ourself more vulnerable fundamentally this is very much the same dilemas we have faced with nuclear uh weapons of course nuclear weapons are extremely devastating the potential to really destroy uh human life in the way we know it today uh so in that way it's very easy to be against nuclear weapons and and and I would like to have a world without any nuclear weapons the challenge is that as long as they exist I think we are safer when we have nuclear weapons to deter the adversary of using those weapons against us so unilateral disarmament is dangerous uh what it is good and what you should strive for is balanced transparent uh uh uh multilateral uh arms control that applies for nuclear weapons but fundamentally it also applies for all other Technologies for instance AI cyber well in one way we have all touched upon it because cyber and AI is interl um and um and it just demonstrates that Warfare conflicts can take place in many domains in the old times we had in way air sea and land uh but now we have space as a domain and cyber as domain but do we have strong enough uh offensive capabilities in cyber or are we just continuous attack and defend no again these are sensitive issues and I know that some some countries are very reluctant to speak too much about it but I know and it's not the secret that NATO allies also have uh offensive capabilities I think we call them National effects but it's only different word for the same and I had the the very interesting experience when I actually saw uh in one of the allot countries uh how they used I was actually in the kind of Command Center cyber Command Center where they actually used cyber offensive capabilities to attack Isis this was back in 201 16 or 17 uh and that was extremely effective uh how NATO Ally used cyber to take down the Cyber networks um uh of ice in Iraq in Iraq and and Syria then of course that's perhaps the most not the most advanced adversary that you can face but of course there are offensive capabilities because cyber is now a domain as air sea land and the other domains are and a truly Global domain there are some problems one problem is that attribution is harder in cyber uh so one of the first challenge you will face with a with a full-fledged Cyber attack is to actually decide who is attacking you um uh uh second um the other challenge is that is that um um it's it's it's there's a much more more much blur more blurred line between conflict and non-conflict when when when do you have to trigger Article Five when do you have to declare war uh uh when you have a Cyber attack because Cyber attack is something that's go goes on almost every day in different ways yeah and when when do you surpass the threshold of something which which will trigger a full response from yeah from the armed forces from uh from perhaps or or NATO alliance so the French um Statesman clemont s said war is too important to be left of generals and you have paraphrased this by saying business is too serious to be left to Business Leaders alone what do you what do you mean by that I mean by that that um I believe in free trade I believe in private business but I believe that um some of the issues related to commercial decisions are too important to be left to commercial decisions or considerations alone and again we have touched upon the the most recent examples G from from Russia or over dependence on uh Commodities from China or the export of key Technologies from us to authoritarian Powers it may be a good business deal but it will be uh undermining or dangerous for our own uh own security or for instance allow authoritarian Powers uh to control critical infrastructure again maybe good business deals but make us but make but may potenti make us vulnerable so this is what I mean by it's too important to be left to businessmen alone a US Venture Capital firms have ramped up um efforts within defense but we haven't really done the same in Europe even though NATO has uh Venture Capital arm right yes how how do you see this developing well I I think that we need um we need to invest more in our defense industry uh and uh and we also need to realize that we need Venture Capital we need um Innovation and that's the reason why NATO again Al I'm now stepped down but I'm sure that Mark the the current Secretary General will follow up on this uh has stepped up um uh the efforts to work with private business uh to ensure that we maintain the technological Edge which has been the benefit of Western countries for decades and help to ensure our security we always had the most Advanced Technologies that is not so obvious anymore especially in of the Chinese economy and and their ability to also develop new technologies and uh and use those Technologies in their defense uh production um there's also an other change that has happened over decades back in the 40s and 50s and 60s perhaps even the 70s most of the defense technology was developed by the government uh nuclear was a big state run program Manhattan program in the US uh GPS uh these kind of internet was actually result of government finan government uh uh controlled entities uh research programs this has totally changed now most of the advanced and Technologies are developed in private uh business in private companies AI uh cyber the the whole Silicon Valley the whole the whole and SpaceX all of these things are now private so but but the governments uh and our defense sector which is of course still State responsibilities are totally dependent so we need to work with the private business to ensure that um we keep as militaries the the the the technological lead to ensure that we have the best armies in the future yes let's uh change tag here and U move into happier territories we have something in uh Norway called the spending rule hling reg which you first as a student of Economics uh worked on then as a minister of finance and prime minister and so on and it's a rule which tells how much of the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund can be spent every year to support the budget and it's really been a Cornerstone in the economic planning in this country now what what inspire you to create this rule it was the understanding that Norway was going to get a lot of revenues from the oil and gas and much bigger revenues than we expected um um and therefore when I was prime minister in 2000 uh then we actually had only net oil revenues only for a few years the first net oil revenues came to Norway in 1996 in the beginning they were quite small uh then it was obvious that uh we needed we needed some way of uh deciding how much we could spend and we were very afraid of uh what we refer to as Dutch disease uh to spend too much um and therefore we started partly the kind of academic but also then a political discussion on how to establish a fiscal rule for how much of the oil revenues we could spend and the purpose was actually twofold one was to ensure that uh not only Our Generation but also future Generations get the benefit uh of the oil and gas resources that we are found Onan continental shelf uh that's a kind of long-term perspective the other reason to uh established a fiscal Rule and the and the pension fund um was to ensure that we could uh stabilize the economy to separate earnings from spending and prevent overheating of the uh economy and therefore we we established the pension fund and the first money was allocated to the pension fund in 96 but perhaps as important was this fiscal rule where we decided that all the oil and gas revenues uh was going to go into norian pension fund and then that the only thing we're going to spend was the financial return uh which we estimate to 3% in yield terms per year as an as an average and therefore the fiscal R says that we should only uh spend on average uh the fiscal uh return 3% estimated um uh and um and that has served Norway very well it's quite a Feit to manage to get um political consensus around the spending of such vast resources uh and probably one of the successes of uh well one of the main successes of the fund uh has it worked the way you thought yes and if anything it worked even better uh uh uh because uh partly because the fund has become much bigger than we expected for many reasons oil and gas production at thean content Shelf has been bigger prices have been higher and we also have good Investments because of people like like you have been able to manage the fund in a very good way so the combination of all these things have made the fund much bigger and therefore also the fiscal rule more important if you had at the time when the fiscal rule was made had also made a rule for how much uh in total could the fund contribute to in percent of the budget what do you think that percentage would have been I think it would have been lower than the current percent which I think is now 25% or roughly almost one one quarter of the norian state expenditure or state budget is finan by the return from the oil fund or from so instead of 25 what do you think he would have been if you I am not able I know I but but but but but then I think it's important in a way as I'm not able to give you an exact number but I think it's also important to understand that there are concerns and I'm careful being going too much into that debate because that's a very Norwegian debate and I and I'm careful being too specific on issues I not worked so close with over the last years but but I think the the idea back in 2000 when we made the fiscal rule was in a way that this was going to it could last forever because in one way NATO has sorry Norway has spent zero of the oil uh revenues the only thing we have spent is the fiscal return on the oil revenues and um and and of course that can last forever uh as long as we have the installment the CH The Challenge and you know that better than anyone one else is that of course we now have some much our wealth in the stock market then of course there can be big fluctuations uh that can have a impact on the Norwegian economy and that's a new risk which we didn't face at least not in the same way uh uh before um uh so and and I'm always a bit careful um uh changing these kind of fiscal rules too often because that will undermine The credibility uh perhaps it's better to have an imperfect rule which is credible than to always try to uh run for a more perfect rule but which is um constantly changed that will because this is this is a self-imposed restriction and the biggest success in a way is that a Democratic Society as Norway has been able to handle this enormous amount of cash without spending it uh uh I remember back in the 1990s when we uh had this discussion and started to invest in in equities and and had the first allocations to the pension fund many experts also economists colleagues of mine said this cannot happen the the the Democratic institutions politicians they will spend if they get the money they will spend so they were actually in favor of reducing the oil and gas production to keep the wealth uh in the continental shelf um and the actually former Governor noran Central Bank bank harm scan he led an expert group and they said it cannot work politician will spend if they get the money we have proven them wrong and that's the biggest success and but but again if you start to change these rules too often you may undermine in a way the the magic of the Line in the Sand which is which is the the fiscal rule I think we can say Well done norian politicians and well done the Minister of Finance and the management and the the the NB and all those who have been irresponsible yes we talked about how the world has changed since since you wrote this book uh how have you changed I've been I've become I to say more realistic about the the dangers I I I I have always been extremely optimistic and and embrace the world and free trade and openness I'm less that guy now uh because I've seen the backside of that uh medal or that coin and I've been as I've always been in favor of the transatlantic Bond North America and Europe together but of course being in NATO for 10 years I I'm more aware of the importance so I'm more I'm more I say even more committed to that idea I'm 10 years older and and first and foremost not first and foremost but but in on top of that for the first time in my life I'm I'm in one way free meaning that and that's not only a good thing I always worked in public sector uh as an economist as a politician and in NATO which is also public sector and now I'm I'm back in Norway and start a new life which is very different from the life I lived up to now and that's a danger it's it's scary but also a good thing yeah you mentioned that um both you and R had worked in a multi multi-party system you know with lots of parties uh you have to work with the union and so on now how that experience how has that made you a better Diplomat and negotiator you think well I think I think that's the most important thing I I brought with me to to n to and the most important thing that Mar brings uh with him to Nato is this of leading something where you have to find compromises I think I've never been a CEO but I think when when you are a CEO just make decisions that's at least my my my my impression in a private company and you have a very clear mandate when you're a prime minister especially in a multiparty governments uh and with not clear ma majority in the in the parliament which is the case in more and more at least European countries then you need to find compromises every day that's just the the the the rule of of of the game and and and that's also when you are the boss in NATO that's the same you have uh not many parties but you have 32 different countries and they all have to agree because you talk about beautiful compromises most people don't think compromises are so beautiful but you you really like them yeah I like them partly because I think that very often actually the solution is better when you make a compromise uh uh um then you then you find something which balance different interests and and and and and that's very often the best solution to take into account different interest different views but second that's the only way to make decisions and to and to move forward and and our Democratic societies are compromises between capital and labor between right and left between different political views um and overall I believe that these open societies uh with different interest are better than extreme societies that uh just adad to one religion or one political ideology M now now uh Nordic leadership style is also more it's a it's a flatter style it's more about consensus and so on was that also something you brought into NATO yeah yes I brought it into NATO but it was less conscious than I than I was aware of because I just brought the way I have led norian governments uh for 10 years uh I brought that same culture to to Nato um I afterwards or after some years after some some time I realized that that was the some extent a new style uh but I believe in talking to people having open access to people and to also be frank so I think it's much easier to have good decisions when the people you work with actually have the courage of telling you that you are wrong or we have to do something different or this doesn't work instead of people are afraid of criticizing or or or being frank and open with you you ran this country um during the July attack uh the terror attacks that had and you know through the Ukraine situation in NATO what are the how does one lead uh during these traumatic situations what's the key to sto it's to remain calm in a way um and to and to make sure that you sleep uh uh uh because U it is important to be able to function uh so I've seen some people in crisis exhausting thems too early uh so so you need to protect yourself self um that may sound a bit egoistic but but I think if a leader shall function uh uh over time you need to ensure that you get the support the help so you can do what you have to do as a leader to be there uh to formulate uh a message to to uh to be present especially in the public domain for a political leader and therefore also need not to be shy to ask for help and support M how do you work with feelings I'm a bit strange there because because when the crisis are acute i i i suppress them I just keep them away and and in one way I think that helps me dealing with uh feelings um um so I remember especially in 2022 no sorry in in in in 2011 the terrorist attacks on the 22nd of of July friends of mine were killed uh people I knew very well worked with were killed but I didn't fully take that into as I say myself until days after uh because I think actually the fact that I had the role to play that I had to lead that I had to give speeches to be present to give Comfort to those who have lost their loved ones that helped me to deal with my feelings um of course it's not a sustainable way you canot do that forever but for at least the first days to have a task help me to deal with my own feelings is it lonely it is lonely but but perhaps less lonely that's that people believe Al I and that's a party up to yourself I I think if anything I'm quite good at at asking for help asking for advice calling people asking them to come uh to talk to them and uh about the big things the Small Things the feelings uh and I think it's a bit up to yourself as a leader to be able to open up and uh accept people into your life and I if there's anything I'm quite good at is to uh allow people to help me who do you who do you allow to help you almost everyone as meaning of course those who are closest to me uh working with me um family members my wife um but but they can also be you know more or less random person who are there if I have a if I have some makeup before a TV show or something I can ask all those what do you think about this what do you think about that so so I think it's about the openness to advice not be afraid of uh of of getting advice now uh you may not particularly want to talk about it but you have uh this incredible presence right uh one of the most incredible presences I've seen and you know I was so lucky I came down to brussells to have dinner with you and you you live you lived in this gated community and I you know I had dinner with you at 7:00 came me through the gate walked for 50 m and then there is one person standing on the street welcoming me yeah and that's you yeah and you are the Secretary General of NATO and a very very important man and I just felt you know a bit overwhelmed by that experience but I like I like people I like you and and that's natural thing for me to go out and say Hello uh and uh but who taught you that how did you pick it up no I never that who who P how did you pick it up it just Falls natural for me uh it may be that I learned it more from my father than I'm aware of because he was also very open for know to like people and I and I think it's impossible to be a politician without liking to be together with people to app I get energy from being together with with people it's not a cost it's something actually gives me something that that when I'm together with with with people um then of course sometimes I also need to rest and then I just I leave as I go maybe a sudden I go early to bed or I I I I don't uh attend reception or or or dinner but but or I go in the weekends I can go out in norian forest or and iow to be alone or only together with my wife or close friend but but in general it's it's something that actually gives me energy to be together with people talking about um people just how you at NATO you've been dealing with um you know people who are perceived to have you know large uh egos I guess what's the key to reaching consensus with them and getting to agreement no I think it's about taking their concerns seriously and to even if we disagree on many issues we may they may Al actually also have relevant points and uh and concerns and uh without being too specific of course there have been a lot of attention of how did we manage four years of uh president Trump in the white house um and and and it's no no secret that I disagree with him on trade and or abortion or or climate change but that is that was not core issues for NATO so what I focused on was what matters for NATO and actually on those issues we were had yeah a large degree of agreement his main message was that European all had to invest more in events he conveyed that message in a way which was a bit say not as didn't use conver different than than many other political leaders but but the core of that message was something was absolutely the same as President Obama had done before him or President Biden does now uh and I took that concern seriously and I think that helped the same with with with President erogan people asked me how how does that work well he has expressed serious concerns about the fact that no other country NATO all country have suffered more terrorist attacks than than than turkey so take that seriously so I think focus on the issues uh uh that's the best way of uh uh addressing strong political leaders you're now back in Oso how does it feel it's great to be back in Oso uh it's a sunny fall day it's not always sunny in Norway but it is actually I like Norway I like Oso this is the time this is the town where I'm born and grew up uh uh have my family my wife here uh uh so that's that's that's that's great uh it's a bit different of course uh but it's a new life and and it's fascinating uh to open a new chapter of my life why is the forest so important for you because for me nature is a place to be a bit alone uh or to together with one or two a persons in be close with them it's a way to both just relax but also to exercise and then of course it's nice to go out and have dinners but actually one of the best ways to be together with all the people it's for me just to walk and we talk and we walk for half an hour or 3 hours uh and but you also cook yeah I cook because I hunt I hunt Okay no I am I the very strange thing I my family has has no what should I say had no interest for hunting but then when when I was 50 I had some 50 years crisis as we called in Norway so then I started to do strange things including climbing some mountains which was something I never did before uh and starting also to hunt which was a totally new experience and then I hunt uh the three or four days every year and uh often I don't shoot anything uh but sometimes I able to shoot a Norwegian reindeer yeah and then I uh one of the specialities is then to prepare the reinder for friends yeah and I was lucky enough to be at one of those dinners but the the thing that really impressed me was that you served Earl Gray ice tea no Earl Gray ice cream which you had made yourself yeah but that's now this is a very good podcast because now we get all the best information about me because I I when I lived in in NATO I had the privilege of having a chef in the house of course there were lot of dinners and and representation and so on but they also prepared uh food for me and uh and especially during the corona we were a bit stuck in that house um so I spent more time in the house than than than normal uh and then I started to actually learn from him how to cook I'm not a chef uh and there many very few dishes I'm able to to to to make but for instance to make my own homemade ice cream I'm actually bought a machine uh so I can make quite good ice cream uh and it's not so difficult but it's nice to serve ice cream which you have prepared yourself and the Norwegian population and the European uh population should uh make food for you every day because you have uh served uh the country and Europe and made it a safer place so uh big thanks for doing that and big thanks for being here today no thanks so much oh
