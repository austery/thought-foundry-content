all the turmoil that Mao causes all the people when he gets in power tens of millions of people are dying and yet there's never a major Insurgency after he takes power there's never a coup that works Communists are good at this when the North Vietnamese win what do they promply get famine and in Vietnam I think you have kind of three harvests like how do you ever have famine in that place but uh yeah they did uh Comm this is the Brilliance of Communism is this Comm R system and the party system and how they set up their government it's incredibly effective about maintaining power it's a very effective about seizing power during Warfare maintaining it that thereafter but it does not deliver Prosperity it it delivers compounding poverty take a look at North Korea it's a mess but the man's in power why don't the highlevel officials in the CCP after they see the impact of the Great lead forward the the lakes and D J pings why don't they well they they they um uh he he wasn't running day-to-day Affairs but in terms of making sure he's never in position to in the future reolution um this is when you get uh Pungo haai who uh this he was the General that was in charge of forces during the Korean War and also long he Long March generation he had lost several of his siblings to starvation over the course of these Civil Wars and uh he he he and Leos shachi pulled the plug on Ma and then Mao is uh demoted from one of his positions uh and that's when you get the cultural revolution cuz U Mao is on his way out of power from these guys so what does Mao do is he rallies the youth the red guards these are the children who've been educated in communist education about how wonderful the Communists are and beloved chairman Ma so chairman now tells the teenagers that they should be in charge think about teenagers not much life experience but telling them they're in charge and then they start out by killing off their teachers right they have teachers they probably don't like and it's incredibly empowering and then they start working their way up the educational system and fan outward and uh it's like a semi Civil War and then this is when ly baow comes in who is a military leader and Ma's going to use him to restore order uh but after he's ousted all the people who are going to get rid of him so that's what the cultural revolution is about and it it um is ruinous for production right doing all this and you're gutting your education Sy educational system like all the people who gave the hard grades who have may actually known something they're gone from M's perspective didn't the cultural revolution work extremely well because for him yeah for he he launches it because he sees kushev speech in 1956 denouncing Stalin and what he had done he didn't want the same thing to to him after he dies and today look the portrait of ma hangs in the square and he's like revered in the way that Hitler or Stalin aren't revered in their countries despite killing more people so yeah well though I think Stalin's having a bit of a comeback with Vladimir Putin so and and Vladimir Putin is starting to mimic more of the um centralized he's going to recentralize his economy in ways that start looking like the old one when people say things like xan Ping is acting like Mao how do you react knowing how Mao actually behaved oh xiin ping apparently reveres ma my understanding about XI Jin Ping's education is his dad was a very highlevel communist leader who was purged but not killed and sent to sort of interior North somewhere in China and so when she was on the what is it the down to the countryside movement where a lot of kids were sent to really horrible places he was sent I think where his dad was so what or or where protectors who liked his dad were so it wasn't as bad it could be but um he was not well educated because he couldn't be in that period right it's during the colge he may have degrees from places but the institution in question during the the cultural revolution wasn't delivering an education so he he's a believer in communism don't don't ever kid yourself that the the Communist Party of China doesn't believe in communism now they think they've modified some of the uh economic stuff under dun shaing but now they're recentralizing it right back the way it was given that the uh the fact that he personally suffered during the cultural revolution I think there's a story that at some point because his dad was denounced he was denounced and he like tried to come back to their home to get fed by his mother and his mother had to turn him away this happens to him during the cultural revolution how do you explain these like um the CCP officials who personally suffered during the cultural revolution being prau I mean Stalin was abused as a child and then he's incredibly abusive Hitler was abused as a child I why why would you expect well you're assuming the man I I use the word psych sociopath or psychopath I both apply to him uh don't think he's going to have any Tender Mercies for anyone oh he abandoned various sets of kids who starved to death and died and one son he put him right up in Korea where he could get killed and he promptly did so oh and Stalin that was another great one well the Nazis captured Stalin's son and wanted to trade him for some something it's stons na na n h how do people in China today think about Mao and why why aren't they more pissed off you know you look at these numbers I I'm I'm guessing I'm not Chinese um but I think all of us need to be proud of things and of course one thing to be very proud of if you're CH Chinese is Chinese civilization these enormous achievements in philosophy in The Sciences uh all kinds of Arts it's incredible but many Chinese also want to feel proud of their leaders and so ma is incredibly consequential and I think it's also really hard um to look at the dark side of your own country this country has slavery it is our original sin we have not gotten over it and the part of the United States where slavery was most deeply embedded to this day has the deepest problems dealing with that
