Before I get started,
I just want a quick show of hands.
Who here has teens or pre-teen children?
OK, cool, that's a lot of you.
I just want to know,
has the experience been for you
the same as it's been for me?
And by that I mean very connective,
the communication is always very clear,
there's never any conflict,
definitely no sneakiness.
Same, same?
OK, great, good good, good.
I'm glad we can start
all on the same page.
But it's wild, isn't it?
How quickly our children are growing.
I began thinking a little while ago,
how do I find a way
to stay connected with my children
when they're in this stage?
When they were little,
they would climb up onto my lap
and ask me to sing them lullabies
and read them stories.
And now I feel the time
that we have together
just slipping through my fingers.
My kids are digital native youth,
and that means the entire time
they've been around
so have video games and smartphones
and the internet
and all of the technology.
So I've been watching my kids
play video games for a while now,
but I had no interest myself
until I had this genius idea.
I wondered, what if instead of trying
to pull my kids into my world with me,
what would it be like if I stepped
into their world with them?
I mean, back in the day,
I was pretty good at "Diddy Kong Racing."
So like, how hard can it be?
Picture this.
I'm sitting at my house
with my headset on,
with my PC in front of me,
and my kids are over at their dad's house.
My oldest, who are then 10 and 12,
are there with their headsets on
and their devices,
and we all dive in to the wonderful,
magic, mysterious world of "Fortnite."
Immediately my kids are off,
racking up points,
opening treasure chests.
I literally don't know what they're doing
because I am right where I landed,
spinning in a circle.
Don't even know how to open
a door or open a treasure chest
or move on to anything.
And pretty soon,
I have to let my kids know
I've been shot and I'm down.
(Laughter)
Immediately, my 12-year-old said,
“It’s OK, hold on, Mom.”
And this kid comes running towards me,
building a structure
out of literally nothing
and holding his hand over me to heal me.
That was kind of cool.
I didn't know you could heal people.
My middle son --
if you have a middle son,
you can probably relate with this --
he comes crashing a semi truck
through the wall his brother just made,
hops out in a full body banana costume
and lays his hand over me to heal me.
After the exasperated sigh
of "Why do I have to?"
That was the point
where I could have quit,
where I could have said,
"I'm terrible at video games.
This is not for me."
But I didn't quit.
I didn't quit because
we were laughing so hard.
I was laughing at the absolute absurdity
of this entire situation,
and I suspect they
might have been laughing
at how completely terrible
I was at video games.
But at that point they decided
that they would stick closer to me
and teach me how to play this game.
But I didn't just learn about the game.
I learned about them.
I learned about the connections
that they make together
and the way they communicate
while they're playing these games.
And maybe the most importantly,
I learned this is the connection
that I've been craving as well.
I feel like we played
and connected in a way
that not a lot of teens
and parents get to connect.
Because we connected through play,
we connected through them
teaching me a new skill
and me being brave enough
or silly enough to think
I could maybe play along.
And as it turns out, I wasn't alone.
I was talking to my brother Amos
about video games
and he told me something surprising.
He told me that he has connected
with his nieces and nephews
more through video games
than anything else in the entire world.
Before you judge him too harshly,
you need to understand
that Uncle Amos lives in New Zealand.
Before he was in New Zealand,
he lived in Germany.
So the entire time
that my kids have been around,
they've never known Uncle Amos.
They've never been
in the same country as him.
He would not get an hour-long
phone call from my kids.
But hopping on "Fortnite,"
playing games together,
making memories together.
Maybe learning how absolutely feral
my middle son is.
It's a game changer.
Now, you might be sitting
there wondering, what is esports?
Luckily, it's pretty simple.
Esports are just competitive video games.
Anything can be an esport
if it's a competitive digital game.
Games like "Fortnite,"
shooter games like that can be an esport,
or games like chess can be an esport
if it's played with computers.
What ties them all together
is that they're all competitive.
If you have ever talked to a child,
like ever in your life,
you've probably heard of games like
"Mario Kart," "Fortnite," "Rocket League."
All esports or electronic sports.
But do not call them electronic sports
because you will lose
all of your street cred,
especially with your children.
Trust me on that one.
And it's not just my kids
who get to have this experience now,
because the state
of South Dakota this year
sanctioned esports
as a high school activity.
Yeah, that's pretty great.
(Applause)
So right now, kids
are playing esports teams
within the four walls
of schools in South Dakota.
This is important because
these kids are not just playing,
they're practicing,
they're practicing and gaining skills
that they will use
for the rest of their lives.
Skills like leadership, teamwork,
communication, strategy,
and the ability to handle tough emotions.
So fast forward to these
same kids starting their careers.
Businesses also get to benefit
from the skills that kids have gained
in high school and in college.
And in that same vein, we can talk
about the inclusivity of esports.
I challenge you to think of a more
inclusive sport anywhere in the world.
It doesn't matter your age,
your background, or your ability.
Anyone can play, compete,
grow and win in esports.
Of course, there's other benefits
that I didn't notice
until I got further into this
with my children.
I understand that as a parent,
video games and esports
are kind of a complicated subject
because we fear the communication
that happens within these spaces,
especially because sometimes
our kids are talking to strangers.
I think that that's a valid fear.
And I understand now,
when I joined my kids in this space,
I got to learn with them
and helped teach them
how to navigate this space.
I also learned that it's not just scary.
There's joy in these spaces
because this is a shared space
and we can have shared experiences here.
When I was there with them,
I got a first-hand glimpse
into their world,
and I learned how to better protect them
and help them through this space.
In fact, video games even helped me
when it was time to introduce
my kids to someone new.
As a single parent,
it can be kind of awkward
to introduce your kids
to your significant other.
So a couple months
before we introduced our families,
we all hopped on Fortnite
to play together.
This is a life hack, I am serious.
So we, his kids and my kids and us
all jumped on Fortnite together
and it was pretty awesome
because there was no pressure of like,
if we didn't have something to talk about,
we're just playing a game,
we don't have to talk.
If things weren't going so great,
we could just dip.
We didn't have to stay
for any certain amount of time.
I got to see how he responded to my kids'
silly, competitive or sometimes
a little bit feral nature.
And I also got to see
how he responded to his children
if they were upset
or being critical with each other.
And then,
when the time came for us
to introduce our families in person,
we all had something to talk about.
And maybe this idea
isn't so new after all.
Because back when I was a kid,
my parents told me
that TV would rot our brains
and threw our TV into the trash.
Growing up in rural
South Dakota in the '90s,
I really didn't miss our TV that much.
If you grew up in South Dakota
in the wild, wild west
or east, in my case,
of South Dakota in the '90s,
you probably have a pretty good idea
about what we got up to.
If not, let me paint you a picture.
Imagine trying to ride cattle in a field.
Maybe climbing up to the second-story roof
of an outbuilding in the winter
to hop on your sled and go
screaming down the other side?
Or maybe the timeless tradition
of daring your city slicker friends
to touch the electric fence,
knowing full well how that will feel
because you yourself have touched
the electric fence a time or two.
But these are all memorable
parts of my childhood
and stories for another day.
But I will never forget the Christmas
that my parents surprised us
with a Nintendo 64.
This gorgeous electronic
came with four controllers,
and it turns out my parents
didn't throw our TV away.
They just put it in storage.
So they brought that old box down
and we all got to sit down
and play together.
It was a blast playing with my brothers
and sometimes I even won.
Like I said, I was pretty good
at Diddy Kong Racing.
But the true joy came when we would get
to connect with my dad.
You see, my dad had two
distinct sides to his personality.
On one side, he was pretty strict
and serious and a disciplinarian,
which I understand,
he was raising a gaggle of children,
so that can kind of be expected.
But on the other side of him,
he was playful and carefree
and absolutely hilarious.
And when we all got
to race and play together,
this is the part of him
that we got to see.
My brother Ezra told me a story
about one day he was sitting
at home playing "Halo,"
and Dad came home on his lunch break.
Dad sat down and started playing with him
and pretty soon, half an hour goes past.
Then an hour, and then
it's two hours later.
And finally, Ezra is like,
“Dad, don’t you have to be at work?”
And Dad said, “Work can wait.
We're saving the world right now."
(Laughter)
My dad didn't really like video games.
He didn't really --
He didn't like them,
nor was he good at them.
But he chose to connect with us there
because that's where we were.
He chose to speak our language
even though he didn't really like it.
Now that he's been gone for eight years,
I wish that we could make more of those
memories with my kids and with us.
And as a mother now,
I draw from those experiences
as much as I can.
Whenever my kids ask me to play
"Fortnite" or "Minecraft" with them,
it doesn't matter how busy I am,
I never regret sitting down
and playing with them.
Video games have surprised me
in so many ways,
from schools creating a sense
of belonging for kids
who wouldn't otherwise have that,
to teaching them skills
for their lives that they will use
for the rest of their lives.
From my dad playing with us growing up
and me playing with my children,
when I speak of esports,
people come out of the woodwork
to share their stories with me.
Not stories of sitting in a basement
and chugging energy drinks.
Stories about connection.
That's what brings this all together.
When I began pondering how I would share
this story about esports with you all,
I realized if I wouldn't have said yes
when my kids asked me to play "Fortnite,"
none of this would have happened.
I said yes to them,
and then my boss asked me
if I would drive up
to northern Minnesota
to research this esports competition
and see what it would take
to make that happen here in Sioux Falls.
I started learning from
and with my colleagues
about how to build this
right here in Sioux Falls.
And then last September,
I got to co-lead South Dakota's
first all-ages free esports competition
in Sioux Falls,
and our board of directors
has agreed to bring it back
for round two this October.
(Cheers and applause)
And now, today, I'm standing
here on this TEDx stage.
Somewhere I never saw myself
in a million years.
But this whole journey started
with wanting to connect with my sons.
And ultimately, that's who
I'm still trying to connect with.
What I found through
flailing around Fortnite,
saying yes to unexpected opportunities,
and learning alongside my children
is that connection is always worth it,
even if you don't know
how to open the door.
My sons are who I keep saying yes to,
and I would say, the best
unexpected benefit of all --
my kids legitimately think I'm cool.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
