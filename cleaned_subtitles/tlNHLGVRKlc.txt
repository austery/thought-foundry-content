I think Americans need to worry about overextension any country has to worry about overextension we have finite resources also you're talking about sending your fellow Americans go get themselves killed that's quite something to ask someone to make that kind of sacrifice see it had better be worth it right there are 300 million Americans while the world's got 8 billion uh be cautious and it's what's key on this Maritime order the big insurance policy of it all is our allies and institutions this is the great gift of the greatest generation of having created the UN which is how many millions of lives have been saved from polio vaccines and other things that come through the UN do not dismiss these organizations they've done a lot or the EU work through these things and listen to your uh allies they'll they will have insights and there is power in allies tell me who China's allies are the crazy man in Korea who can't even feed people in the 21st century although he certainly feeds himself but that's a whole yeah I mean it's it's incredible a China who who are China's friends I mean Iran a theocracy I mean talk about P who does theocracies anymore okay the Iranians okay good on them so after World War II the Soviets are giving the Communists in China tremendous amounts of leftover weapons from the Japanese at the same time Truman does an actual arms embargo on shenek in 1946 the martial plan for Europe is 13 billion to help build up defenses against communist uh appeal at the same time Truman is has to be forced in 1948 by Congress to give a couple hundred million to China literally 100th of what was given to Europe and by that time it's too late for Chen kek if you just look at that record it just seems like sort of we've abysmally messed up after World War to and helping the national state in power right do not exaggerate the capabilities of any one country for openers but I think it's really important to distinguish between nation building and Nation rebuilding if you're rebuilding which is what happens in Japan and Germany they already had full up institutions modern economies before the war they had no problems with educational institutions going all the way up judicial institutions they had competent police forces they had elements and other things so that when you give Germans some cash and Japanese as well they know exactly how to recreate things and rapidly produce modern institutions you're talking about China they never had these institutions there is no indigenous expertise oh and by the way what's the illit the literacy rate in China compared to Japan whoa no one reads in China and everyone reads in Japan it's not quite that bad and we've had this problem in Iraq and Afghanistan so we decide we're going to do the deification thing and then we think the police are going to still show up and work except no it's that's not how it works they haven't got these institutions and so it's not feasible to a Marshall Plan in China would not have worked and also we had really competent Foreign Service officers in China in this period why they're the children of missionaries and so they spoke fluent Chinese and had a deep understanding of China and they were saying it's hopeless that there is no way shankai sh's going to win this thing because he's hated by the peasantry which he was because for the reasons I've told you right if he's busy droning them into his armies because he feels he has no choices whereas the Communists are giving them land and educating them you better believe who the The Peasants are supporting and the missionaries they were then caught up in the McCarthy purges and were just about ruined lost their jobs in the state department elsewhere only to be exonerated I don't know 10 15 20 years later when they've already lost their careers and who knows how they raised their families I thought it was a case that later on they realized it was hopeless and so then they stopped supporting Chang but it's at the time it different people realize it at different times but the reason they didn't support Chang as much as they should have was because it was just thought that like Cheng is going to win and therefore we don't have to support him they they're constantly goting the nationalists to form some sort of ceasefire do some sort of coalition government when in fact what I should have done is like no you have to make sure that you keep China no it was considered hopeless this is called making a net assessment of not what you want it to be but an accurate one they believed it was not feasible even in like 1945 46 you're talking hundreds of millions of people we can't even deal with Afghanistan today with what 20 million people it's not feasible it's at the end of World War II American GIS are sick of it and as are their parents we didn't to send G we just had to like not Europe has been leveled and there's this absolute fear that the Communists are going to move into Europe which actually counts for Western economies in those days the Italian and French communist parties were incredibly strong so all the focus of limited resources is going to make sure that Europe settles out and we don't have infinite resources I feel you could do better than one 100th of the Marshal plan to keep China returning communist and look what the consequences was Vietnam we had to fight Korea we had to fight Cambodia the genocide there got it but you can't solve all these things there are things that are not feasible I want to linger on this because you're an optimist anyway maybe you're right but anyway you've got my take on it and you've got I I can't prove I'm right I remember in your book there's a passage where you say there's so many sort of individual intention things that led to the Communist taking power if any of these factors was off the outcome might have been different of all these factors the fact that American suppor or lack thereof was not one of them it just seems like it was a super contingent thing but also America not being as strong as they should have just didn't matter I don't know that it it's just not politically feasible I mean talk about it you want to go put yourself back in those days you've already done a three-year tour in World War II because in those days you started serving whenever it was in the war and you weren't coming home until the war was over it was none of this nine-month tours a year tour here and there it was you're there for the duration so you get home and then you're told go make nice to the Chinese and go get self killed there how is that going to fly in your family probably poorly I mean again you don't have to send the g. there you can just not do an arms embargo on them uh I think it was so Minor by then it's too late the great question is some people would argue then 1946 when Marshall tells shankai Sheek to stop halt his Advance this is when he's doing quite well when I mentioned that the terminal point of retreat for the Communists was up in sipping Manchuria someone are arue that Marshall should never have done that he should have let the nationalists go all the way up and that would have changed the outcome of the Chinese Civil War you can make an argument that that might be true here's the counterargument I don't know the answer if you look at a map of China or imagine one manua is way up it's like a Salient into communist territory because it's bordering all the Soviet Union and then it's got quite a coastline but the Soviets had blockaded that so nothing nothing's getting in that way the only way given the Chinese Railway system is literally one train line connects manua to South China so it means shangai sh's movements are incredibly predictable so one argument you could make and people have and I don't know the answer none of us does is that hey that was the big error so if that's the big error uh the mistake and this is a common one that Americans make so this is worth talking about is America amans often don't look at Waring parties to understand is if they are primary adversaries there is no way you're going to make them make nice so the United States had trouble for years trying to get pakistanis and Indians to cooperate and it would want to give Aid to both of them and just didn't get it as long as they're primary adversaries you Aid one it infuriates the other and they're never going to cooperate the two of them or I suspect what was going on in Iraq and Afghanistan stand so you want to have a democracy and you want to have all the parties represented well if they all want to obliterate each other the last thing they want to do is have representation of the other side right so if you have parties that want to exterminate each other the idea of getting them to cooperate is impossible so don't try it so that would be the lesson from this thing of the we kept trying to do a coalition government with the Communists and the nationalists it's a non-starter mhm the United States was a very isolationist country and didn't have the attitude of a great power until after World War I and World War I uh we felt dragged into it and these horrible Wars and that being quite irresponsible during the Great Depression and just ignoring everybody else's problems didn't want to hear about it and then we get a World War II out of that and then we rethink that whole proposition
