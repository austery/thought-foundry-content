Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today we continue with the content from last episode.
Let's talk about why people's sense of agency is underdeveloped.
This is the root cause of falling into superstition and irrationality.
In the previous video
We are discussing such a phenomenon
That is many superstitions and fanaticisms throughout history and across the world.
All of this is inseparable from the participation and promotion of intellectuals.
To this day
We can also observe many such phenomena.
Many with high education
Experts and scholars who have mastered complex knowledge
Once you leave the professional field
They will appear very helpless and blindly obedient.
They will easily
Swallowed up by some grand narrative
Even in the field of this major
They will also abandon their proper judgment.
We draw the following conclusion:
An abundance of knowledge cannot mask a poverty of subjectivity.
Because their personal boundaries are blurred.
Constantly in a state of being "infiltrated" by the outside world
In a fundamental sense
True rational thinking cannot be taught.
Rather, it is a product of an individual's pursuit of freedom and individuality.
It is in a person's self
From the collective representation of chaos
Difficult to separate
And began to try to be proactive,
In the process of independently grasping the world
Slowly born
But here's an even more interesting phenomenon:
That is, people who lack subjectivity.
They often don't consider themselves to be blindly following others.
on the contrary
They are good at combining rationality and science
It becomes a defense mechanism
Transformed into a set of sophisticated armor
To package its fragile, empty core.
This is a very typical Chinese-style rationality
A rationality without self
Or more accurately
It is a kind of solution,
Degrading and restoring the rationality of the self
So, this video...
Let's discuss this topic in detail.
I will put this video in
The list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
Speaking of this kind of Chinese-style rationality
I think
In our lives
I often see this type of person:
To regard reductionism as truth
When you talk to him about people
When it comes to emotions, dignity, and uniqueness
He'll coldly tell you: Stop being so dramatic.
Humans are nothing more than a bunch of protein and water
Your love
It's just a chemical reaction between dopamine and oxytocin.
Your pain
It's just fluctuations in neurotransmitters, etc.
For example
When you want to pursue some unconventional ideal
He would throw out a bunch of big data and statistical patterns.
This is to persuade you to give up.
For example, less than 1% of people have achieved this.
What makes you think you're the exception?
You are just a...
There are no special samples.
For example, when many people discuss social issues...
Like to emphasize
"Objective laws" and "historical inevitability"
For example, believing that at this stage of development
Sacrificing the interests of some people is inevitable.
This is the price of moving to a higher stage.
They believe
This objective law
It does not require human subjective will.
Driven by initiative
The whole world
Naturally, one will progress to a higher stage.
This kind of thing is very popular in Chinese society.
A calm and rational way of thinking
However, this rationality
However, it is based on an unproven assumption.
Each person is a blank slate, devoid of distinctions.
Individual internal factors are unimportant.
Meaningless
Furthermore, this seemingly calm and indifferent rationality
Hidden behind it is an extremely deep fear.
That is, it is itself a defense mechanism.
In a personal will
In a social environment where one is easily rejected by external factors
If you take the initiative
Kill, belittle, and deconstruct the self
So when this self
When crushed by the collective, authority, or fate
The person involved will not feel pain.
There is even a sense of liberation and detachment in the joy of liberation.
Through this kind of spiritual "scorched earth policy"
The parties involved were able to return to a peaceful state of mind ahead of schedule.
No more painful death
And this state
Rationalization as a high level of wisdom
And genes, molecules,
Statistical patterns, historical patterns, and so on.
They were all just playing the role of the one representing destruction.
Symbols of power and death
Of course, we are not saying
A person's spirit cannot be denied.
It's not that
As long as it's something a person truly wants to do.
It must be right.
Rather, it means we should explain spirit through the lens of spirit.
Within the framework of spirit
To find reasons to support or deny
Instead of using an external,
Non-spiritual laws
Go directly declare it invalid
Of course I could persuade another person.
Don't do this
For example, a friend
disregarding everything
I want to quit a stable job
Go pursue your artistic dreams
I probably don't think this is a good choice either.
However, this kind of persuasion
It should not be based solely on statistical patterns and big data.
For example, the average income in this industry is very low.
How to
These things should only be used as reference information.
Moreover, the other party is most likely aware of these facts.
Explaining spirit with spirit
mean
We should first unconditionally acknowledge and affirm
That most fundamental spiritual need
Then based on this
To explore that surface-level behavioral strategy
Is it reasonable?
For example, this friend wants to resign immediately.
Go be an artist
The feasibility of this strategy may not be very high.
But deep down, the person involved
A strong desire
Able to create works that are unique to oneself
Desire to be seen and acknowledged by others
Instead of repetitive work day after day
This deep-seated motivation is 100% legitimate.
It is absolutely reasonable
Only when we admit it
The rationality of this spiritual need
Only then can we discuss specific behavioral strategies.
Explore whether there are other
A gentler, more gradual approach
To achieve this goal
We say
This model of explaining spirit through spirit
It is also a kind of rationality
But unlike that kind of rigid rationality,
This rationality
It is based on both parties having
Beyond a clearly defined self
thus
It will not restrict or devour a person's freedom.
On the contrary, it will expand each other's spiritual world.
But this vibrant rationality
This seems to be rare in Chinese society.
Why the spiritual world of the Chinese people
Easier to be this
"Dead intellect"
And it is difficult to nurture fresh,
A vibrant rationality?
this
Let's get back to today.
The core concepts to be explored
"The Law of Interpenetration" and "Collective Representation"
Let's start by discussing the law of mutual penetration.
The concept of the law of interpenetration
First by French anthropologist
Lévy-Bruhl proposed
He discovered while studying primitive thought
Primitive humans were not like modern humans.
Put "I" and "the world"
The distinction between "subjective" and "objective" is so clear.
In their world
There exists a mysterious force among all things.
Invisible connection
The so-called "law of mutual penetration"
It is a kind of indistinguishability between subjective and objective.
A mindset that transcends boundaries between people and things
Under the influence of the interpenetration law
A person no longer believes in logic and facts
Instead, it believes in the interplay of all things.
There exists a mysterious sense of connection and infiltration.
A rational person with subjectivity
His basic premise is:
Subjective will cannot replace objective facts
I want it to rain
It might not rain.
I hate someone
This does not mean that he will encounter misfortune.
The ancient Chinese concept of the unity of heaven and humanity
This is a typical example of the interpenetration law.
For example, the ancients believed
The occurrence of natural disasters
Its root cause is not a change in the physical world.
Rather, it is the disorder of human order.
Earthquakes, floods, solar eclipses
These are things that modern people would consider
It is a purely natural phenomenon.
In the eyes of the ancients
It was Heaven's punishment for the ruler's lack of virtue.
condemnation and warning
Here
Human morality and nature
order
Bound tightly by a mysterious bond
mutual penetration
Mutual induction
certainly
This often stems from complex political struggles.
For example, using natural disasters to attack political opponents.
But the discourse system that enabled its establishment
Its underlying logic is the "law of mutual penetration".
For example
Traditional Chinese medicine views the five organs of the human body:
Heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys
It is not considered an anatomical organ.
Furthermore, it is believed that
It corresponds to the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.
And the five emotions of joy, anger, thought, sorrow, and fear.
Here
Between emotions, organs and natural elements
There is no causal chain in modern science.
Rather, it is a symbolic, mutually permeating connection.
For example, many Chinese people believe that you are the one who is shaped by what you eat.
It is believed that eating animal kidneys can nourish the kidneys.
Here
The function of kidneys and human health
It is believed that a mysterious intuition exists.
Eat it and you will gain its power.
This way of thinking
It is ubiquitous in Chinese culture
As
The ones we quoted before
Wang Yangming's famous saying:
The world is still one family
China still has one person
If one distinguishes between self and others based on physical form...
A petty person.
This illustrates Chinese culture
It's not that I don't know the boundaries between people.
And the difference between humans and objects in physical form
But in terms of value,
In the highest spiritual pursuit
It tends to dissolve this distinction.
It considers the highest wisdom and virtue
It lies precisely in transcending this distinction of form.
Reaching a state of complete immersion in the universe, where one forgets oneself and all things are one.
In this realm
Clear personal boundaries
It is seen as a limitation of petty people
When a culture
When the highest level advocates the forgetting of self and external things...
An inevitable result
It is an obstacle to cognitive ability.
because
It is fundamental
It eliminates the opposition between subjective and objective.
This enables independent analysis of objective objects.
Calm Analysis
Become impossible
Even immoral
It's the behavior of a petty person.
Science is possible
It is precisely because we can describe a natural phenomenon
Treat it merely as a natural phenomenon
Excluding all morality and emotion
and the projection of mysticism
Purely using cause and effect,
Analyze it using categories such as space and time.
Harmony between humanity and nature, and the interpenetration of all things
It sounds so romantic
There is an aesthetic value
But in reality
This kind of thinking often doesn't lead to poetry.
Instead, it leads to hysterical paranoia.
Because of human beings' resistance to disasters,
Attention to risks and losses
Always greater than the benefits
When a person is in a state of mutual permeation
Things in the outside world
When it can directly penetrate into his soul
His most instinctive reaction
It's not about absorbing the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon.
Rather, it is to prevent the invasion of evil.
This can easily lead to a
The endless pursuit of "purity"
And extreme conservatism and fear
Because the subject does not have independent, self-existent boundaries.
Therefore, everything external
Whether it's a natural phenomenon or a foreign culture
Everything was mysterious to him.
It is a kind of power that can control his mind.
The power of the enemy
therefore
He was in a state of endless fear of everything.
for example
During the Boxer Rebellion
People believed that the foreigners' railways disrupted the feng shui.
The foreigners' electric wires severed the earth's veins.
This is not a physical injury.
It is also a spiritual penetration of Chinese culture.
Since everything is interconnected...
So they used foreign products.
For example, matches, pencils
It is equivalent to a person's body and soul.
Already been taken by foreigners
Corrupted by evil spirit
He would no longer be a pure Chinese.
Instead, they are traitors and collaborators.
The collective must be physically destroyed in order to be purified.
Of course, this kind of thinking also exists in Chinese society today.
For example, some domestic mobile phones
I'm very used to using patriotic marketing.
This is also based on a principle of mutual penetration.
Its essence is the collapse of a person's personal boundaries.
In this state
The subject cannot detach itself from the object.
It felt like being sucked into a giant black hole.
Unable to establish an independent perspective
As Hegel said...
Clear thinking must exist on its own.
In other words
Only when you can yourself
Pull out of the surrounding environment
As an independent observer
When examining the world
Logic and rationality can only be born from this.
If a person's spirit
Always in a state of
Dependence and Subordination to Others
So his thinking
It can only be a pot of mixed fear,
A paste of desire and fantasy
Because we need to observe the object clearly.
It is always necessary to define an independent base point.
To leverage the world
The main body needs to be from
To "transcend" from the chaos of the world.
To become "self-existent"
And this transcendent action
At the mental level, this manifests as the ability to abstract.
for example
Before the emergence of mathematics in ancient Greece
Whether it was ancient Egypt or Babylon
Mathematics is more of a practical skill.
It always and
Specific sensory substances are intertwined:
To measure the land after the Nile floods
To calculate the volume of the barn
To record the goods traded
At that time, "round" meant wheels and plates.
"Number" refers to a flock of sheep or soldiers.
Mathematical thinking
It has not been separated from the specific object it serves.
And the ancient Greeks
Especially from Pythagoras
To Plato and Euclid
Completed an amazing leap
They started for the first time
The pursuit of pure, abstract mathematics
They were no longer satisfied with studying this.
Or that specific round object
Instead, they began to think about what "the circle itself" is.
A perfect
It doesn't exist in reality.
Only a point and a radius
The pure idea constituted by this definition
Regarding this point
Our future
I will make a series of videos on Western philosophy.
To talk about
If we look at it from a psychological perspective
Let's examine the law of mutual penetration.
Then we can discover
It is somewhat similar to a borderline personality disorder organization.
The person involved is unable to integrate their own feelings.
and opinions of others
Their inner world is divided,
Composed of broken fragments
They lack a sense of self
Sense of integration with significant others
Because there is no continuous and stable self
Therefore, any disturbance from the outside world
They can penetrate his mind directly.
It became his internal pain
He has difficulty distinguishing between "external events".
And "inner feelings"
For him
The turmoil of the outside world
It is the collapse of the internal self.
Fragile, fragmented selves
Nature does not have a fixed boundary.
To distinguish between "I" and "not me"
This is precisely where the "law of mutual penetration" comes from.
Psychological basis
individuals with borderline personality disorder
Interpenetration can be easily achieved using projective identification.
In projective identification
Individuals not only [dislike] the parts they cannot tolerate
For example, anger and incompetence.
Projected onto another person
They will also unconsciously seduce,
Force the other party
Feel and act as you project yourself.
Just like one's inner state
It truly became like the other person's inner reality.
at this time
The psychological boundaries between oneself and others have become completely blurred.
From this we can also understand
Why
Many people are keen to use reductionism to dissolve their ego.
This is essentially a form of defense.
That is, by filling
An uncertain, living self
Reduced to a bunch of indistinguishable...
Predictable substances
It was able to escape due to unclear self-boundaries
And could be attacked by "bad objects" at any time.
Invasion and Devouring
Fundamental Anxiety
To summarize
In today's video
From a philosophical and psychological perspective
In-depth discussion
This mutually penetrating mental state
Such a premodern,
Chaotic mental state
What practical technologies and methods are used?
So stubbornly preserved
Even in modern society
What about those that are constantly copied and reproduced?
This leads to...
The core concept of our next video:
"Collective Representation"
That's all for today's video.
