I was like, maybe they're right. Maybe we should just sell. And I remember having that conversation with Ben, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. You can sell. You're going to make a lot of money and you'll be super successful in life, but you know, if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, you know, I missed that one shot. That was the one thing I should have taken it all the way. Now I'll never know how far I could have taken it." Could have been.
>> So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? You know, I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less. excited to bring back Boss Talk. This was a series that you guys did a few years ago on Clubhouse that was a a big hit.
>> Yeah, we had fun. It was Ben's idea.
>> Yeah. Excited to bring it back. So, in the spirit of of of boss talk, let's talk about the the first time that you became a boss in terms of running uh uh data bricks. Um, let's talk about the moment in 2016 when data bricks was was uh not things weren't as smooth as perhaps they should have been and we were looking for a new CEO and uh Ben you recommended Ali. First of all, like kudos to Yan for building the company originally and uh Ben uh you know investing and believing in us and then also I kind of couldn't have done the CEO job. Uh Ben basically babysat me uh the first couple years a short short baby
>> you know so uh um but I I did know what was kind of wrong with the company because I had been there for two three years and I had seen from inside you know what we should change and what the issues were. uh but we had an open source project that actually became very successful thanks to those first two three years.
>> Apache Spark became a worldwide sensation and we could pride ourselves on the number of downloads uh of the software.
>> Well and and and the uh the Spark conference. Yeah. You know
>> Yeah. Spark conference.
>> Now the data and AI conference.
>> Yeah. But the problem was that uh you know as it is often with open source is that you just uh um everyone's just downloading the open source version. actually your biggest enemy uh is your open source project. The main thing you have to fight in the market is hey why can't I just download the open source version Amazon is offering it the cloud vendors are just offering it I'm just going to use that
>> so this was the biggest challenge that data had at the time and we needed to do like very serious aggressive pivots internally which were going to be very very painful to lots of people like to the whole ethos of the company internally and uh uh so I kind of knew that for almost a year so when I got the shot uh that's kind of like the the what we started doing
>> the strategy was like make spark the biggest open source thing. I mean I I can remember it on all the slides now and then you know data bricks would have the best spark but we never data bricks never had like necessarily we didn't do a lot to make it the best spark or or not differentiated enough and that was kind of the first thing all he did on the product side and then he hired um Ron Gabrisco which that was transformational because that kind of dragged the company into the world. Yeah.
>> So obviously that was the right right decision and and paid off. Maybe zooming out. Ben, you've worked with and and you know all the great CEOs of our and worked with them. Um where where does Ali spike in where are his superpowers as a as a CEO as a boss that have uh helped you know contribute to the impact.
>> I mean Alli's really good. So like I always rate CEO. So it's like okay if I was running that company would I do a better job or a worse job? And and with data bricks I do a way [ __ ] worse job. So, so he's good on many many dimensions. So, I I'd say first of all, you know, he he is a real technologist like not a you know pseudo technologist um like his competitors. I'm sorry. Um so he really knows the product. He understands the product strategy in detail. He also uh ran engineering before he was CEOs. you know, mostly what I worked on him with with him on the early days was just okay, go to market and BD and um and he's really good at both of those. Uh, you know, that's where we had to catch up. You know, Snowflake had an amazing go to market. Uh, and then we needed a big deal with, you know, kind of big partners. And every time I I got him like a little BD tutor, John O Farerrell, who who did a nice job, came in and kind of taught Olly about how you structure a deal, how you do things. But like he learned everything so fast. And then probably the thing that he does that is I wish I could get all our CEOs to do is he doesn't he doesn't hesitate. He trusts his eye. Like he'll see something and he doesn't know if it's right. And so if you look at the strategy changes data bricks has had, you know, one big one was building a data warehouse. Like that that like is a pretty big swing and a seemingly like quicksotic insane idea given where they were. Um, but you know, he he both knew he's paranoid enough that he knew that that could be an issue and then he trusted himself enough to go get deep enough to decide whether to do it or not as opposed to, you know, ignore it like these guys are trying to kill me. I don't want to see it. Um, which is what a lot of CEOs do and you know, so that kind of thing. But there's a lot of there there's a lot of elements to that job. It's a very complicated job. Al Ali talk about more about the journey about you know evolving from an academic a technologist to someone commercial. Um it's it's a you know journey we our CEOs go through talk about what it was like for you in in the context of what others can learn from it.
>> Yeah I mean uh so so we were in academia so we were you know scientists and then you know I led engineering and product so you got to learn how to build a you know product and get product market fit and then I became CEO afterwards. Each of these has different sort of challenges. I think that in all of them the thing that is in common is that you really have to understand and be extremely good at the task at hand. And so number one admit that you don't actually know everything about the job. Uh so a like you know first step of anonymous alcoholics like admit you have admit you have admit you have a problem. Okay. And then number two uh be a student and learn everything you can about it. Right? go all the way down to the details and try to learn from the best and uh and then you know work your butt off like you know you're you know nothing you're zero right it's like you know nothing about writing reliable software um so I think for that's I would say that's was the same thing I tried to learn I tried to network with the best heads of engineering with the head best heads of products I try to read every book you know I got as much as I could uh you know out of Ben and Mark I read all of their blogs all of their books everybody else's but then you know you do search and you start you know search firms are really great at getting you to meet who's the number one product manager by reputation in the market right now. Can you get 30 minutes with that person? Just sit down. They're not going to join you because your company is too crappy and too small. Can you get 30 minutes with them? You know, can you get a dinner with them? Can you get a breakfast with them? And then just ask them lots and lots and lots of dumb questions and they'll tell you. They'll happily just tell you like, "Hey, here's how I run. You know, here's how I do it. The other guys are wrong." And then, you know, they'll give you a playbook and you can go compare it. You can go to the next person and say, "Hey, this is the playbook I heard from like, no, no, that's totally wrong. You don't do it that way. Here's how I do it." And then, you know, very soon you learn enough. And if you, you know, really have grit and you work hard, um, uh, you're going to be able to do great things. That's about you yourself. But also, if you hire a great team, because as a leader, you know, you alone can't do much. Um, so can you hire the best people out there? Uh, so that's also part of that. Do you know what great looks like? Have you interviewed all the best people? And then can you now sell them and get the best people to come work for you? Once you start assembling a team of excellent people, uh, then they will uplift you. This is a managerial leverage that I learned from uh from Ben um you know which which is from high output management uh by Andy Grove. Uh but it's basically are they so great that you're learning from them like you know it's like Ali was a great head of engineering but actually he was a great head of engineering because the people that worked underneath me were doing amazing things and that was I was just standing on their shoulders. So you just have to do that and you have to instill everybody else to do that recursively so that you end up with a just you know amazing killer team and you got to continue doing that. Now you have to okay for engineering it wasn't actually that hard cuz I had written a lot of software but now you're CEO so now you have to do that for marketing you have to do that for sales where you know they were super helpful because they had done it with loud cloud and opsw so they knew how to build a B2B machine how the game was played uh but you you have to do it again but now you're doing it in a field where you're really clueless and also probably all of your instincts are wrong and your intuition is completely wrong uh so can you be clairvoyant and see the truth or do you want to lie to yourself and that's where I think a A lot of founders make mistakes. Like they'll do well in their own archetype. When they have to step outside of their own archetype, they make a mistake. They hire people that are like their own archetype in other roles where that could be lethal. So,
>> by the way, that's how we started uh data bricks was I think everybody was a PhD in computer science who was running anything.
>> Yeah. Like including sales.
>> Yeah. Yeah, that's probably the number one mistake is you just go, okay, well, like I'm an engineer, so I want a sales guy who can talk to me and understands engineering. And that's like, well, that's not a really good criteria for sales. Like, one thing that I'm good at is rather than telling somebody, you know, that's stupid and hurting their feelings or so forth, I'll ask them a really [ __ ] up question. Um, you know, actually, I did it in in a board meeting. I I I said, "Well, like could you help me with the math on this?" Cuz I I I don't understand the math. Um
>> actually, it was worse. I said, "Help me with the I'm just trying to understand basic math. You have all these numbers on the slide." Yeah.
>> And if you said that your conversion ratio is 5%. But I can't divide any of those two numbers to get 5%. And then the person freaked out and said, "No, no, don't freak out. Just tell me which of the two numbers do I divide to get 5%." Because I've divided all of them and none of them is fired.
>> Like, am I going to be fired? So, so, so he does a much better version of that, which is he'll like if if somebody's really really screwed something up or messing he'll go, "How do you think it's going?" And I was like, since he told me that, I was like, "Oh, yeah, that's a better way to do it. That's even better."
>> So, yeah. Yeah, he he's he's a very good student.
>> Can I refund that? So like you know I think that's a you know there's this book called radical cander and I think people take it too far and they misunderstand it and so on. But I think the essence of that book is that um if feedback if if you know are you criticizing me?
>> Yeah.
>> Are you saying I'm stupid? I can't do the vision cuz my point is not about the 5%. I was trying to make a different point and now you're just this is a cheap shot and now I'm like hurt and I think by the way I think you're wrong. It's not five. I said six and a half.
>> So are you criticizing me or is it like no no I'm here like to help you. I can like not help you but if you beg me for help maybe I'll help you. So, which of the two modes? So, if you can get people into the mode of like, "Oh, wow. I'm like being helped, like they're helping me and I'm going to get further ahead in my career and I'll be more successful." Uh, please, no, no, no, please don't leave. Come back and tell me more like cuz I'm I'm taking notes here. So, if you can flip to that and I think a lot of uh feedback can be recast into, you know, I'm just here to help you, but feel free to completely ignore this advice. But, you know, if you want to be really successful, if you want to get that job or if you want to get that project next time, if you did it this way that you probably would have had a higher probability of getting that, but you know, I don't care. Like, you do whatever you want. And then people are much more receptive. They're like, "No, no, no, please. I want to know more."
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then just the frequency of it, I think, helps a lot, too, where if you if I see you once a year at your review and I tell you what's wrong with you, you're going to be offended. No matter what it is, no matter how wrong it is, no matter how correct I am, it's going to be offensive. But if every day if I see you doing something I don't like, I go, "No, don't do it that way. Do it this way." Then you get desensitized to it. And so I think the mistake a lot of particular engineers make is they just don't say what they think when they think it because they're afraid of hurting someone's feelings. But that's how you save their feelings because they're used to you. um you know that's you're you're always doing that and you're doing with everybody. They see it. They're like, "Oh yeah, [ __ ] Ben's an [ __ ] He's like always doing this, but like that's how he is and like that's how we work and it's no problem." Um as opposed to, you know, the the hammer and you try and put in a [ __ ] sandwich. Oh, you do this really well, but this is all [ __ ] up and this is good. And people are like, well, so like now in my written review, you're telling me that for the first time this is all [ __ ] up. Like [ __ ] you. Yeah, this this is very common and and you can see this in in the industry that you know people it's like
>> you know the extreme version of it is like they get fired right
>> and then head of HR talks to them and they're like do you know do you see this coming it was obvious right you knew this no I had no idea like wait you didn't get any feedback on this uh no like I I only got thumbs up all along for like a whole year so I'm in shock um this is super common right
>> so maybe on the topic of managing talent um you have this incredibly high intensity culture at data bricks Um, and there was this thread recently in our CEO thread where they asked everyone, but you had a great response on, hey, we have 50 people. How do we scale? We have this culture of 996, right? You work 99 six days a week. Um, how have you scaled that intensity well into 10,000 employees?
>> I think, uh, start with, you know, setting the tone at the top. If you're the hardest working person, you know, it kind of everything will take care of itself from there on. Uh, if you're not working hard, it's very hard. I mean it's if you have you know it's a double standard I mean Ben has a whole book about that like which is you know you know it's basically you know what you do is who you are is the whole title of the book right so it's like if you are working extremely extremely hard the rest of the organization is also as well uh you know are you calling people at 9:00 p.m. 10 p.m. are you working weekends do they expect you not that you expect them and you're going to be angry and yell at them if they're not dropping everything for you not that but the fact that they just know that Ali is working 24/7 and he's working 7 days a week and you know he's working at 11 p.m. or 2 a.m. or whatever it is. Uh, I think that gets a lot of it done. Uh, the second thing I would say is, uh, you can vet for this when you hire people,
>> you know, and the easiest way to vet for it
>> because, you know,
>> well, it's you got to be careful with it because the people who say they're going to work the hardest are not the ones who work the hardest.
>> So, don't so don't
>> It's the opposite.
>> Yeah. Yeah. 100% true, right? So, the best way to vet for this is to do back doors. You know, ask people if if I ask someone, you know, hey, how was Sarah? Like, did you did you like was she great? They're always going to say, yeah, she was great. Right.
>> But they're going to be much more honest if you ask them like, "Hey, how much uh does she like grind the midnight oil? Is she like and they'll tell you right away. It's like, oh my god, she works like crazy." It's like, um, you know, she's I mean, I think she has a good balance. You know, you can like sus that out very easily from back doors references. You can people will remember the people and they'll just offer it up and say, "Oh, that person was like nuts. They were like working 24/7." So, um, I think that way you can get people that are hardworking. By the way, I don't want to overemphasize. I don't think everything is just work harder. You know, you have to also work smarter. And uh I think that you want to make sure that uh it's sustainable. I can work insanely hard. I'm motivated. Um everybody has a different threshold for how hard they can work. Uh I don't think you want a culture where people are burning out. I think you really should avoid that. In fact, you know, at data books, I'm very often going in and saying, "Hey, this team like you know your scores are really bad on work life balance. Like what are you doing about it?" or you guys should take several days off or you should do some offsites or do something like we we actually go in and if we see that there's some groups and other groups at data bricks you know their their work life balance scores are like 100%. they're like, you know, slacking off. Um, you know, so then it's kind of the opposite. But, um, but I do think that you can you can kind of up for that. Um, and I think that also setting the expectation. Um, you know, I would say, you know, uh, one of my competitors, Frank Slutman, wrote a book called Amp It Up. Uh, it's a great book on how you get, uh, you know, execution into a company like getting a high performance culture where you everybody's always trying to excel and do better and better. Sort of that kind of culture into a company. That's that's a good book if you want to just study and he's doing it at scale at bigger companies. So I think that's highly recommended reading as well.
>> Yeah. And I think you know a lot of it at at his scale ends up being things like organizational design and do are people feeling like they're having an impact when they're like it if people are feeling like they're having an impact and they're good then they'll work very hard. Um, but if you're in some kind of weird three-legged race that the CEO has constructed where everybody's got dependencies on everybody else, it it just doesn't matter, you know, like you'll you'll just have a lot of people go like I know if I work hard, it's not going to make a difference. So, like why would I do that? And like you can't overcome that with rahrh and you know lead by example or anything else like that's just fundamental to how it is. And you see in like look in any company of any scale um you know even at our scale like look there are some groups who really uh can have impact and work extremely hard and then groups who have lesser impact will work less hard and you just see that
>> you know people who are motivated and they feel excited about work and they don't see the impact that they're having they're going to work way way way harder versus if you're demoralized and you feel like it's it's not going well I'm not having impact I don't have any autonomy um then um you know you're not going to you just don't want even you're like kind of depressed sitting down working. I do think there's one thing here where leaders can really help which is to make your team feel like they're winning and that they're doing a great job. Like you can ask more from people but if I feel like hey I'm losing and everything we're doing is wrong
>> and I'm putting in all these hours and it's stupid like there's like what's the point of this then people don't want to work. So you you so I think it's like feeling like we're winning like we're the winning team. we're winning like you know and wow they're expecting more from me and you know so then I think you can get you need that motivation in people.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Which is why by by the way the hard job is when you aren't winning.
>> Yeah. to get the output like particularly in uh
>> Silicon Valley because you know you're you're battling attrition this and that and to get things on the right track that that that that takes a whole different
>> kind of level of technique and storytelling and
>> show you how you could be winning and all that kind of stuff that that gets very very complicated.
>> We've both done that, right?
>> Yeah. There's been phases in our company's lives where
>> we weren't winning.
>> Yeah. I mean especially you know this the story you had in heart about heart things which is probably the best business book I've read which I read by the way before uh starting data bricks and influenced us a lot um you know those are superant yeah that's that's the difficult that's such an important point because even if you're winning people got to feel like that but if you're not winning getting them to feel like you're winning is we have a path to winning
>> yeah we have a path
>> we have a you know and it's like rock solid it's going to work but It demands sacrifice from all of us, you know,
>> and it and there is no feeling as good as when you're not winning and then you get it to winning.
>> Like that's the best feeling. You can't replicate that once you're super successful. You you never can quite get that feeling again.
>> Yeah, that's true.
>> But you also never feel that horrible pain again.
>> Well, it's easier to be the underdog in some ways, right? You know, you have nothing to lose
>> in some ways. in most ways not.
>> Well, I want to explore this leading from the top because that was kind of the first thing you started with. Um, we actually hired an ex data bricks employee to A16Z. So, we have some inside scoop on your leadership style. And one of the things he said was, you have this, and Ben sort of touched on this too, but you have this amazing ability to be strategic, help your team focus, but you're also very in the weeds. Like, you're giving product feedback, you respond to emails super quickly. um and product launch emails, no matter how small they are, you'll respond congrats, which you know, he found it hugely motivating. How do you do all that? Like, and where do you fly high, where do you fly low?
>> Yeah. By the way, I I respond even to progress reports on all those products and I follow them in detail, every one of them. I try to respond to every product. Insane
>> respond. But um um look, I think this is if you're just going to fly high and give highlevel like inspirational speeches and then you know we'll trust and we'll delegate to people. It's not going to work. So my way is you know you got to get in the weeds. You got to understand this is back to what I said at the very beginning like how how do you become great at head of engineering? How do you hire a great head of marketing? The only way you can do that is by being really excellent at it. So you need to study the game and become the best. So um so I try to stay, you know, stay tuned to all of these things. Um
>> there's this quote if you do everything you will win
>> and then the question is you have you done everything.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah so you know you just it takes a lot of effort um you know you need to learn all your keyboard shortcuts um but uh but I think that's you know people feel motivated that hey I have like direct relationship you know we used to say we used to have one of one of the culture principles used to be hey uh be a co-founder uh and we don't want to have any employees at data bricks we just want co-founders. So, uh, and the key point was like, hey, you're kind of the owner of this company. You're not just a renter. Come here and yeah, we can talk about it and you can you can suggest an idea. You might have just joined and you're straight out of school. You might have a great idea for a product. Tell me about it. You know, I'm I'm happy to push it. And so, it's it's making people feel like they they have an impact and they're inspired. Back to Ben's point, then it's going to be much more exciting for them, right, than following some bureaucracy. So, I I don't follow the bureaucracy basically. I go talk to anyone I like, you I try to go to the person that is actually the closest to the work that's being done at any given time.
>> Uh but there are some tricks and rules around how you do that without breaking the whole organization. So you can't just willingly uh talk to anyone. Uh but yeah, that's that that's part of it.
>> Yeah, you listening and giving direction is is very different on that. If you give direction, you can cause a lot of chaos. Um, but if you you go talk to people, you listen to understand the problem and then send it back down the chain of command tends to work very very well. But look, generally you if you're a CEO and you don't fly low and fast, it's going to be a mess because you don't you never get the truth because the truth never makes it to you like through your people. Like if you if I go talk to Ali's executive staff about what's going on in their organization or anybody's, first of all, they're gonna spin it. Second of all, they don't actually know. And so like you can't you need to help them debug their organizations because they're they got a million things going on. They're also kind of going to the problem, going to the bottleneck, trying to figure out what's happening. And so like that it's just a very unreliable source of information. All the knowledge in a company is with the individual contributors that are doing the work and the customers that like there's no there's no knowledge with the people who are talking to you as CEO who are on your staff. That's not that's not the way information moves. And so you got to be now he's like super fast and which enables him to go super low. But you know in any given time the way to think about it as a CEO is it's not like you're spending the exact amount of attention to HR as you are to you know the key engineering project as you are to the you know the key kind of sales competitive deals and that you you have to you don't address everything evenly. You can never do that. It's just a bad idea. Now, you'll probably get to everything eventually, but you're not spending the same amount of time on every single department. The ORC chart is not the way that company works.
>> It's just a communication architecture.
>> Yeah. I I think the best way I would say it is like it's kind of like a T and want to be broad and then you have the leg that goes down and goes really really deep. But you want to do that anchoring. Uh and the key thing is to have a really good priority order of what's most important
>> and kind of drop everything else. like you know you drop that tea and go really really low like it might be HR I might be deep diving all the way down to HR looking at our HR handbook our policy everything like who was this person what happened why is this happening in that group what's going on in that group what's the culture in that group what happened here like you might want to do that it might be existential for your company as we've seen some companies went under because of HR problems right uh or ethical issues that were going on uh so I think having a really good priority order is really important I think some execs like they just want to have a perfect ducks in a row I have my weekly one-on- ones I have my weekly staff meeting, I have my weekly this and then I do this and then we follow the rules and we do all of this and then that's like just like the top part of the tea
>> and then there's nothing that goes uh deep and that's the issue I think.
>> Yeah. Over systematizing or or making it like symmetrical. You don't even you don't have to have one-on- ones with the same frequency of all your staff or like some of them you you know like you can meet very seldom well like everything is different. Every part of the company is different. You may need to meet with somebody every day.
>> Yeah.
>> Um and then other people,
>> you know, you can meet once a quarter for now because it's just not that serious. Um and you can't get caught up in making everything fair and symmetric. Particularly like your staff, they got to be able to deal.
>> Yeah. And this is actually the biggest conversation that
>> I had with Ali early on is like if they can't do it, they can't do it.
>> That's it.
>> It's a wrap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't try and fix them. They can't be fixed. It's not going to happen.
>> And you know, it's a sad lesson, but important lesson. I actually I want to turn the conversation to an area that Ben was saying you had to catch up on at least in the beginning. Um which is the BD dealmaking stuff which is interesting to me just because I think of you as like a consmate dealmaker now.
>> I feel like you're playing chess everyone else is playing checkers. Um I want to go back to 2017
>> with maybe one of the first gamechanging deals that you guys did. Um and that was the deal with Microsoft.
>> Can you guys talk a little bit more about how that deal came about? Anything you do differently? Um, and by the way, founders still to this day ask us about it because it's sort of a model for how they'd like to do deals.
>> Yeah, maybe maybe I should start by saying that, you know, we had tried to get close to Microsoft for a long while. I think Ben had told us you need to that's an important partner uh because they have the biggest distribution channel. You know, they today they have 60,000 sellers. If you can unlock that in any small way, it's going to be a game changer for you. And I had been try and I had been CEO for a year. So, I'd been trying hard to get uh in there and many many people offered me, you know, hey, so here's I actually know Satya, so I'm going to get you introduced. And I got multiple introductions to Satya. He just like either never responded or just CCed his EA and it went to into EA, you know, like we're still trying to find time. He's been so busy this last six months, you know. Uh so uh but then uh then he had a meeting with Ben and I think he was here actually uh at A16Z and um and uh they actually just talked and I was not actually in the loop and then he called me up and said, "Hey, I I talked to Satya and I think this is he's excited. He wants to do this."
>> And uh I I saved the email. So Ben introduced me to Satya and this was I think 3 or 4 AM I was like in New York and the email went to Satya and then Satia added like four or five people to the email thread and then they added four or five people. So like within an hour I had like 25 emails in my inbox and suddenly all these people that were not responding to my emails from Microsoft right after Satia CC the next person they were all like hey I'm clearing my calendar would love to meet you do you have any time in the next two days or 3 days or you know but really kind of the original pitch of what's the give and get was Ben and Satya at A6Z and they kind of figured it out and I was not actually even there. So we had some luck and then Ali did a couple of things that were or quite a few things that that that were very very effective. So the luck was um at the time deal with big companies there's always a timing element and there was a company called Horton Works um that had a deal with Microsoft to provide some similar kind of functionality and they were basically um putting a gun to Microsoft's head saying like you pay us more money or we're going to pull our product
>> and they were on prem and they were in cloud so it was like a big mismatch also.
>> Yeah. So it was a real So Microsoft was like super pissed at them and wanted to stick it to them. And so that was you know so you have SATA going like I think this company's interesting and then this ground level thing going like we want to [ __ ] these guys and that that kind of opened enough of a door um to get it going. Uh but there were so like one of the most important things in the deal uh was which you know and John O Farerrell really emphasized this for for both of us was look you got to get them to put enough they're such a big company that they're going to lose interest many times. So, if you don't have them write you such a big check that somebody in there is going to get fired if it doesn't go well, you're it doesn't matter if you get the deal, you're going to lose the deal. And so, what we did is we're like, and the technique that we had was, okay, give us a forecast like like we we're a little company. We we can't afford to do this deal, you know? We can only afford to have one partner. So, give us a forecast of what you'll do.
>> Yeah. Cuz our engineers are busy. like they're going to do this integration that wipes out 12 months of our roadap. We don't we don't have anything else. You guys have like many thousands of engineers. So this is we only have one of these we can.
>> Yeah. So we you know whoever can sell the we think you can sell the most but we don't know like what's your so you know like kind of challenged their kind of manhood a little bit. And so they come out with this big ass forecast and we're like okay great just give us a little portion of that.
>> It was a huge deal. It was a lot of it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And then then then Ali said, "Look, you know, when we got all the way down to the deal, he was like, "If I don't get this number, Ben's going to fire me."
>> And so, can you help me out?
>> It was very interesting. Bad cop.
>> It was a very interesting dynamic. So, you know, John Farrell had strategized with us and told us that, you know, they have to do a big pre-commit because then they have skin in the game, otherwise they're just going to forget. They'll do like the PR, but then they'll forget about you. But then when we were trying to get that from Microsoft, I remember I was talking to Tekeshumoto who is, you know, one of the main brains at Microsoft, like one of the key strategists there.
>> And his thing was, I don't want to give you a big commit cuz you're such a small company. I'm worried you take this money and you get drunk off of it and you're not going to do anything afterwards.
>> And so I had to really convince him that no, I'm extremely hungry. Like there's no way like I will continue to have crazy appetites. Don't worry about it. So both sides were kind of worried about different things. But but yeah, the give and get was important that you said in the beginning which was they had a gap in the product portfolio,
>> right? They were competing with AWS. They had a gap at the time and we had a great product. They have amazing distribution channel. So like in in these BD deals, uh there always has to be a give and get that actually is kind of commensurate. And this is why most of these deals fall apart and they don't work.
>> There has to be something that you as a small player can give that they don't have. And usually you don't have anything to give them. Uh usually I find all these small companies show up and they come for instance to data bricks now and say oh we'd love for you to partner with us but what what am I getting out of it right? You don't report to me I don't report to you. So the moment we've closed the deal if it's not good for me neither of us will just do our side of the bargain. So there has to be something in the deal dynamics in the construct that inherently is extremely beneficial both sides. There has to be a trade that makes sense. Microsoft really wanted that product. We really wanted their distribution channel.
>> And then the other thing that I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't understand is any big deal of that size, you lose at least three times before you win it. And we lost that deal
>> 10 times.
>> 10 times. And like including like the day before we were supposed to launch it. Um the you know the the antibodies came out of the company and uh Ali had to fly up to Red VIN and sit there.
>> There was one engineer that just said not doing this. This is not going to go. We don't. He just he was they actually put a guy in place at Microsoft who was actually super you had a great reputation but he was a builder. So he just had huge problems with this. It's like this is not a product I built.
>> Why would we why would I make this successful? Uh so yeah there's like usually there's like many times so like if if you don't have grit those deals will die because this deal died multiple times as Ben said. It was like completely over like it was completely blocked by some exec that said absolutely not. I'm blocking it. It's veto it's over. And no one wanted to overrule him. So you have to go in there and work. You have to And the only way we did I like they call it the nerd bird. I would take the you know uh SF Seattle flight up there. I was up there so much. I knew all the buildings, all the rooms, everything. So you just have to spend time on the ground and talk to as many people as possible and sort of influence that organization from within. And I will say look, you know, with with all the difficulty of the deal and um you know, and and Microsoft being Microsoft, they've been as good a partner um as not only we've had a data bricks, but in the entire portfolio. I mean they've really you know lived up and delivered uh what they said they would do which is I I think you have to give such a a huge credit because like in the whole Gates and Balmer era they were never that good a partner to anybody and he's really turned that around and um you know they they've been fantastic with us. This was around the time where Satcha had taken over and you know he was giving to everyone at Microsoft the book growth mindset or mindset which is about growth mindset. So there was this kind of aura in the air that you know we should we should try like let's try to make things happen. Let's have a growth mindset here. Let's see is there a way we can partner. So this would have been impossible five years earlier. So is kudos to Satia and they put us on the map and he's been a great partner ever since. You know whenever there's been issues they always resolve it. Uh so um you know we are very thankful. We wouldn't be where we are without them.
>> Yeah. No just amazing amazing really. I I want to open up the conversation to dealm more more broadly now that you're not a small company anymore and you're a big company making acquisitions you know uh tabular neon mosaic just to name a few what is your sort of your your approach in terms of when to to to build versus when to buy slash how do you think about sort of acquisitions more broadly? Yeah, I mean what we try to not do, so let's start with a simple thing uh is a lot of companies especially at scale they'll buy revenue. So they'll look at a company they say hey this company is this size we'll just uh buy that company we'll put more sales people on it then we can accelerate the revenue we're buying that revenue uh and that's how they're doing it. Um we're not doing that. You know what we're really doing is number one we spend a lot of time with the team and the founders. So we're trying to see hey can we build together like you come here and you build together that's very different from that buying revenue model the buying revenue model often times you part ways from the C with the CEO from day one like you can see the big companies they literally have a plan like I have you know have some execs that come from these big companies they say hey our plan usually is to part ways with the CEO like you make a deal and the CEO can leave um and then but also the key people in those companies quickly leave all of them like the top management and then you know you keep promoting the people from below that couldn't get promoted before and then eventually you bring in your own people to take over the company and then the company is dead. There's nothing left of it and there's no integration between that asset that you bought and the platform that you have. Um, so to avoid all of those, can you get people that really feel like they're your co-founders? So, we spent just enormous amount of time with who we're like the the company you're buying, who are the founders, how do they work, are we culturally the same? Spend time with them. Do we get along? Do we see the world the same way? You know, are we going to click? Are we going to do this together? Um, are we going to be able to build in the next five years? So, that's where we spend number one. Number two, we spend a lot of time on uh on the product. You know, what's the product experience? How would we integrate this? What would it look like? How much can we can we rewrite most of it? Can we not rewrite it? What's the what programming? Like I always ask this and people like why that's such a dumb question. I ask what what language would you write it in? Like why do you want to do that? What is what does that matter? No, because we're going to integrate the code bases, right? It's like the build systems won't work. It's not going to even compile. So um uh so a product is something we spend a huge amount of time and talking to customers understanding what the um what the what the excitement around that product looks like and how the integration would look like. The last thing we do is we look at the financials you know what's the revenue multiple and you know how much can we grow it and what's the three-year plan five year plan and so on and I feel like big companies corporative departments do it exactly in the reverse order of this. They start with hey the revenue is this but we could accelerate it and the multiple is so low and like you know in this in my Excel sheet here this makes perfect sense uh you know and then second they go to like hey is this a good product and then lastly like hey how do we convince these knuckleheads I mean we probably don't want to have them here but we got to pay them off somehow so uh so I think you know thinking about it that way you get more longevity out of it. Yeah. And this is this really comes it sounds like he's talking um like a product guy, but this is really the thing that people get wrong on the go to market because what happens is if you've got multiple product architectures, that's going to mean multiple SE forces, multiple posts sales things, and your entire sales efficiency is going to go through the floor And because, you know, they have a keen eye on that, everything they buy ends up looking like a data bricks product, you know, like and and that work is going in. They're not just selling some [ __ ] to get some money to, you know, go on a corp dev thing. And and I would say so many uh like when you bring in a professional CEO, this is what they screw up because they don't understand that. Yeah. Engineering goes, "Yeah, yeah, we can take it on. There's another set of engineers. We don't care if they work on that." Blah, blah, blah. And engineering gets less efficient too, but it wrecks the field and that's um and then the customers hate it because it Yeah. Like okay, I've got to learn another access control model. I got to do this. I got you know these are not things anybody wants to be part of.
>> Yeah, 100%. Yeah. This is it's the go to market side that you're worried about that you know that experience that those customers will have. Uh you know they're going to come back immediately and say, "Hey, we were so we were already upset about these things before the acquisition. Maybe you can fix them now." It's like no actually you know several of those people actually quit and now we're going to just work on integration and that thing now got pushed out another two years. Yeah.
>> Um so you don't want to be in that situation. So there's a lot of companies that do that and by the way it work what they're doing works revenue wise. They are getting the revenue they are getting the the stock swap works like you know if they're multiple of the
>> it's a creative deal temporarily.
>> Yeah it works and then the first year you get the bump in the revenue you get a second year boost in revenue growth as well. So fin the financial engineering actually works great for those companies. It's just long term. It ends up being like, you know, a bag of crap that doesn't work together
>> and it affects a brand. You know, like one of the things is the one of the reasons data bricks is so powerful is all their customers want to buy all their products because they're like we know that's the best software we buy. And as soon as you start chipping away at that with these financial strategies, like you can't get it back because the reputation is every customer's experience. There is there's no marketing through that.
>> It's the best software because it was written by the engineers and built by those that were the best. Yeah.
>> Including the acquisitions that we got. They were phenomenal people that came in and they continue and since we gelled, they continued building it.
>> So that's why it's great. It's like the, you know, so we pay a lot of attention. That's like back to the, you know, who are you getting into your company?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Uh that's the other thing, right? Like you can buy something that's got a lot of sales where you're downgrading your whole like company. Ross Perau actually wrote about in Citizen Perau his biggest fear which definitely came true was he built this elite thing at EDS and then they would actually acquire IT departments and they're like he was like they're going to absorb us not vice versa and that does happen. M
>> yeah there there is one really good company that um well one really successful company that we never acquired and I always vetoed it whenever it came up because I just think that the quality of their employee base is not great and I didn't want it to dilute data bricks uh you know otherwise from every other angle that deal always made sense and I always vetoed it because I felt that you know it's just they're all going to quit or be super unhappy let's just not do it. Yeah. It's also why like merger of equals are because
>> Yeah,
>> because the cultures aren't equal. The people aren't equal.
>> And what made you feel that way? You just spent time with them and you they just didn't exude sort of data bricks culture.
>> Well, I mean it's look it's it's like with everything else like it's like when we were gra grading students at the university it's like okay the rock stars are super easy to find out. So they're like there and then the people that are really really bad that's like it's not hard and then there are people in the middle that's it's it's that's in the gray zone. this was a company that was, you know, I feel like the talent is not phenomenal and you don't need to be a genius to know that. And then there's some startups, you know, immediately like, you know, okay, these guys are Olympia winners and they're like phenomenal and they're like executing like crazy and they have a track record.
>> Uh, so I don't think those are that hard and we try to hire these and these this is the one that I vetoed. The hard part is what do you do with the ones in the middle?
>> That's always where you spend all of your energy trying to sus out like, you know, okay, they're not stellar stellar, but maybe they are. Maybe they just didn't have maybe they didn't have the go to market, they didn't have the funding, they didn't have the support that they needed and so on. Maybe they could if we give them a chance or maybe they're just mediocre. Uh, and that's where you spend a lot of your time. But you got to spend time with them. You have to interview all the people. Um, you know, you have to have your people interview all the people. Can't just be this can't be an Excel sheet exercise.
>> Yeah. And Silicon Valley has a lot of lopsided companies. So, you know, you'll have a great engineering team and a bad company because it's like, you know, bad leadership, bad go to market. You also can have like guys who can sell anything with a ridiculously like poor engineering team and they can just sell it and you know you got to be very very careful about that. Actually our you know our our our CRO at data bricks is you know he came from a company that you know he he sell anything.
>> Yeah he was he was he was he was selling SFTP secure FTP which is free
>> and he was selling it for a while. He was selling it for a lot. He was making a lot of money. We're saying, you know, the electronic medical health records, you know, how important are they? If they got dropped, you know, how much of a risk is it to your business? Well, this is secure FTP.
>> You need it to be secure on somebody grabbing that file. He's good.
>> Yeah. The only thing I'd add too is this strategy is probably making you more attractive to the people you want to acquire, too. They don't want to sell if they're going to get fired right away.
>> Yeah, for sure. It's very competitive.
>> Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's also a reputation, right? people know like they'll look back and say, "Okay, what happened to your previous acquisitions?"
>> Yeah.
>> You know, was there a huge fight and everybody's quitting left and right or you know, did they work out? You know, how are you taking care of those people? You know, are they what roles do they have? Do they have influential roles in your company? Um, you know, that's also important. So, you're setting a precedent. You're setting a precedent in many, many ways with acquisitions, M&A, you know, deal dynamics, the price, the, you know, when you go through the lawyers come back and that you're spending all those 20, 30 days doing the definitive agreement. Every little thing you agree to there is a precedent for the next deal.
>> Yep. Totally. No,
>> maybe actually just to turn so we're talking about data bricks as an acquirer. If we go back in time again to maybe a moment where you thought about selling and maybe that you know
>> you didn't actually seriously consider that um but uh I wanted to actually just sort of quote this infamous email sort of circulating our firm that Ben sent to
>> Yeah, Ali brought it I had forgotten about it. you brought it up at a board meeting. brought it to the bed. Um but uh and actually this wasn't and this was not pertaining to selling the company but it was I think selling a a candidate right and um you you talk about hey Ben can you sell this candidate on the fact that we'll be worth 10 billion maybe
>> the candidate was worried about the company getting
>> he wanted he wanted to have a double trigger because the company if databook sells am I and they fire me as a salesperson what equity am I going to get so give me double trigger so I'm protected if we get bought and I get fired I vest all my equity immediately Yep. Exactly. And so, you know, in response to this, um, Ben, and I'm gonna paraphrase this a little bit, but, uh, he writes back to you, I'm like thinking about Ben's tone in this, you are severely underelling the opportunity. We are Oracle in the cloud, and we will be worth 10x what Oracle is. But what was your reaction when you when you saw that? And did that give you more fortitude to not sell the company?
>> Yeah, Ben's crazy. I think the first thought was exactly Ben's crazy. Uh but uh but no, I I think both uh Ben and Mark uh always kind of pushed us to think bigger.
>> I remember we did the pitch at a 16Z for I think our series D which would have been around 2017 or so and uh the question was asked um you know what's the what's your biggest bottleneck? And I said biggest bottleneck is hiring. He said okay well who who who's are you losing to? And I said, "Well, it's Google, you know, it's the fangs."
>> And and the response I got back was, "Well, you need to just add the data bricks to fang. It needs to be fang db with a straight face." And and it was like and I was like, and my reaction was I laughed. I literally said, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is not serious." Like it's like, "Yeah, that's the problem." Like, "Huh?" It's like, "No, I'm serious. You need to add data bricks to fang, you know?" And and then there was like a pause and there was like this and I think it's doable. And so then I actually went back and thought about it a lot and I was like is it doable? Like is it am I the crazy one or are they the crazy one? Who's the crazy one here? Like who's who's nuts here? And you know and that kind of pushed us to think about how do we change our com philosophy?
>> Uh how do we if if we wanted to go and get the best of the best out of Google? What does it require? And we developed a new model but we're like okay actually the way to think about it is your market cap divided by number of employees. That's how much money you can give away in terms of dilution. And actually we did calculated the number at that time and we're like wait we're actually richer than Google in terms of you know how much dilution we can afford per engineer because they were at that time this was like you know before the Twitter downsizing so all the companies were oversized so um so we did the calculations it turned out that we actually can probably pay P95th percentile we did the math on P 95th percentile for engineering and it was like yeah this actually the math works out we moved all the comp bands and we told them and we told the employees about it it's like okay we're paying you P 95th you know and we can afford it and uh so was that came out of that simple, you know, so these simple, you know, your trillion dollars, just add your acronym to the to FANG and so on. They're silly and they're kind of crazy, but they do push you. And you go back and think about, hey, what is the fundamental reason from first principles that we couldn't do something like that? Why couldn't we be a trillion? What's the bottleneck from being a trillion or being part of Fang and then you think about it and you start zooming in on like can we unblock that? Um, so it it has helped us and has been a driving force even though it's you know it's a little annoying you know you know it's like you know hey you know hey mom dad I got the A+ it's like yeah but we ranked I was number two in the class so was someone better than you?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. For what it's worth when I joined the firm in 2019 the series F of Data Bricks was the first deal I worked on and I think the the valuation was six billion.
>> Ben says to us oh well it's going to be a hundred billion dollar company. And we were like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, Ben." Lo and behold,
>> they're doing all this work. I'm like, "What are you doing?" Like, six billion, seven billion, doesn't matter.
>> I was right.
>> He was right. Yeah. Yeah. That one you have proven to be right. Yeah. still have ways to go for two trillion. But
>> well, the thing that you almost never get and Alli and I had this conversation the one time we did have a real acquisition offer on the company is you just don't get this good a market opportunity with this good an entrepreneur like that. That's the rarest of rare things. Like we we see great entrepreneurs but their market opportunity is limited and then we see you know companies that have a great market opportunity but the entrepreneur is not big enough to fulfill that. Um but this was a case where we have both.
>> Yeah I I remember actually the conversation that kind of flipped me. Um the acquisition offer was on the table. It was six times bigger than the valuation we had at the time. And I had done the mistake of telling my co-founders. And
>> yeah, they were like, "Let's go."
>> They were like, "We're done." So, everyone's like, "Stop the work. Stop working. Take your hands off the keyboard. Nobody work anymore. We're done here." Right? And let's count my money. Like, you know, how much money do I have? You know, what would you buy for that amount of money? You know, so they were like completely like not doing anything. And there's just this crazy gossip going around. And then it was like they had told some of the exec and then they were calling each other every day like hey what all he think like you know you think he's he looked in a bad mood today you think he's going to say no no it's like what did he say like he said this thing he said this once so there's just a lot of politicking going around and nobody was doing any work anymore and and I was like you know maybe they're right maybe we should just sell and I remember having that conversation with Ben and I think we were in a car both of us and u uh and you know he says that he drops the fbombs and he pisses people off and so on and they don't take the feedback but actually he did exactly the radical cander thing with me which is he said hey you can do whatever you want I'll support you either case and actually if you sell for this number it's really great for me me being Ben like we make a lot of money at A6 and Z I'll pay the investors back many times over so honestly if it's for me personally that's probably the better option um but I'm just thinking back I was CEO LoudCloud ops and you know uh just the cards I were given that that company wasn't the company you have and when I look back how often do you in in life get a chance to even have a company like CloudCloud or Opsswware, let alone a data bricks. And this is just such a freaking big market. You can sell, you're going to make a lot of money, and you'll be super successful in life. But, you know, if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, you know, I missed that one shot. That was the one thing. I should have taken it all the way. And now I'll never know how far I could have taken it. Could have been.
>> So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? You know, I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less. I really couldn't care less. And I was like, "Okay, thanks. Hang up. We're never doing this. We're done. This is not happening."
>> What a pep talk.
>> Yeah. So that's how we did it. So it was it was excellent.
>> I think I also said, "I guarantee you you'll never have an idea this good again as long as you live."
>> Yeah.
>> This is the best idea you're ever going to have.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, an idea that also takes off and works, right?
>> Yeah.
>> Um, so I want to tie one thing that you said in in all of that is you were company building. Um but then also just sort of the calculus that founders but also your employees are making and that's around comp. Um so in the early days you could afford to pay 95th percentile, right? Um
>> today there's crazy AI talent wars going on. We we've talked about this a bunch throughout the summer. Um
>> and we know that you can bring the best talent in the house, right, to data bricks. How do you keep them with all of this craziness going on? Because now 95th percentile, I don't even know what that means. Is that like you pay a billion dollars?
>> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. The joke is which company says we're P50th? You know, we pay P50th. Like who does that? There's no company that does that. So, how does how does
>> There is. Yeah. The 75th percentile is the single biggest lie in Silicon Valley. It's like a complete fabrication
>> probably. Probably. So, um but um you know, I think that um the it is a crazy time with AI and I do think I feel bad. I did actually an exit interview with someone this morning. I feel bad for the kids right now because there's like too much pressure on them like they feel like oh they have to start companies and they have to and I've never actually had anything like this because every year I talk to the interns uh and uh you know I get questions about how do we build our own company you know how do we succeed at data bricks and so on the last two years have just been crazy all all the kids are like when should I become a CEO when should I start my own company what's a good valuation am I missing out if I do like an internship here for three months at data bricks will I have wasted my opportunity in life and this is like the time for AGI And I could have like been one of the guys that does super intelligence and like you know how would you time that? How was it for you? How old were you when you were 22? What did you do? and you know and so um I do think it's it's kind of crazy times and I do think it's also exaggerated like you know I don't think anyone's getting hundred million dollar offers you know I mean yes there's like one you know character AI and so on but I don't think it's actually true and it's also in the interest of CEOs you should know uh to say that hey you know the you know people try to poach data people from data bricks for a billion dollars and they said no like it's in our interest to say that right because that kind of sets the bar at a billion and then any employee that cannot for half of it's going to feel really insulted. It's like why don't I get a billion dollar offer? Like I heard like on the news that the other people are getting a billion. Um so I I do think that the most
>> by the way Sam used that in reverse on Meta. He's like oh yeah they offered all our guys hundred million dollars into the next guy who got the 50.
>> Now I have to pay 100 at least. Right. That's like the smart move. Um but I would say that look u uh you know and and not all startups have the valuation of their we 100 billion and you know with 10,000 employees we actually can afford to actually pay significant and we do pay significant for the right talent. Uh but you know if what do you do when you're smaller like we were smaller at some point well then it's talk about how big you are going to get and what the opportunity is and what you could do together and what it would worth worth together. Um but I think most uh most people earlier in the career they really want to learn and they want to really feel that they can have impact. So if you can really bring them in and you can sort of mentor them, you can stay close to them and as a CEO you have huge power if you can just spend two minutes with uh you know a kid out of school. Uh it's immense to them and you say hey you know I'll I'll even mentor you. I'll help you like what what do you want to do in five years? I'm thinking about starting my own company actually in six months you know but I'll work at data bricks for 10 years but in six months I would love to be a CEO. So then you can say hey I can coach you to uh you know I I know how the fundraising I know the early days and so on and you can actually mentor a lot of them and that's actually worth a lot to them as well. Uh but in general like help them be successful and help them build their careers and also if you've done it before like we have um you can kind of calm them down a little bit and say hey you have like few decades you know don't worry about it it's like it's not uh you know it's the FOMO uh and the pressure you know has to be uh kind of reduced and I think that's also calming they feel good about it.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I always say the best cure for starting your own company fever is to start your own company and that'll teach you.
>> It's not that easy.
>> By the way, they come back like after start companies often times they come back to data bricks and they're much more thankful and you understand and actually I didn't mention this earlier when you asked about acquisitions. My favorite acquisition uh because I said they start with the people, right? and then the product and with the people I love to hire people who have seen great at a big company like or I don't know if it's great but they've seen process scale big company they've been at a Google they've been at Amazon they understand the processes so that I understand how to navigate a bureaucracy and work with it and they're not going to just be inundated by it but then they've gone on and done their own startup and um and that's really really hard right it's like it's like extremely hard uh trying to do everything yourself and you don't have any help and you know you're trying to do this in this crazy market and you're trying to compete with hundred million dollar offers when you have like nothing. Um, so that takes a certain amount of grit and it's really humbling. Uh, so I love the people that have done both of those. They end up being actually the perfect employees at databicks because they come in and they're really thankful. They're like, "Hey, what these guys have done at databick is actually really really hard. I tried it and I'm really good. I was like one of the best at Google or somewhere and then I did my own startup and we absolutely failed and so hey show some respect here like you know these guys know what they're talking about." So those are great employees actually. So, you know, I think uh keep a great relationship with people who leave your company cuz they'll they can boomerang back in a couple years.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And look, it's it's very hard to make these things work.
>> Um and and you it also requires a lot of luck. I mean, I think one of the things people don't realize is a lot of things have to go right that should never go right.
>> Um and a lot of things will go wrong, but like if you can grab your lucky moments, that's a rare that's a rare thing.
>> Yeah. One one way to prove that is if datab data started in 2013
>> if we had started in 2012 you know that rocky year that difficult year 2015 would have then happened in 2014
>> right to start the funds are we not we don't have the revenue but we were a cloud AI open source company uh those things didn't take off in 2014 so
>> you know even if like if we had to do the CEO change and all of that and I had become CEO a year earlier it just we were too early in the market the cloud hadn't taken off AI was not nobody that was not even a phrase AI meant robotics. People use machine learning as the phrase and uh so company would have failed. We wouldn't have had enough momentum. There's not enough cloud, you know, TAM there to be had.
>> If we started the company in 2014, a year later instead, so a year later than we actually did, then uh we would have had our difficult year in 2016.
>> But by 2016, the cloud was starting to happen, AI was starting to happen, you know, so we would have done the fixes in 2017 and it would have been too late to late to the party and probably the hyperscalers would have taken it away. you know, our competitors were taking it away and we were just wouldn't have get enough momentum to be able to succeed and that's timing of when we started. So, how did we clock it so well? Uh, we had to wait for Mate to finish his PhD thesis. That's it.
>> Yeah, that that you know that that was the whole thing.
>> So, there's a lot of randomness. Uh, and you got to get lucky. and and and it was so on the edge as it was that on the series C um Yan had a handshake with the Redpoint with Redpoint and Redpoint just stopped returning his calls to the point where the series C was led by us who also led the series A and uh NEA who led the series B like we co-led the series C because nobody else would do it. I mean it was that it was that
>> close to going under and most companies weren't even right that would be it.
>> Yeah, it was very close because we couldn't get funding for anyone. It's just funding freezed up and nobody wanted to invest anymore. So it was really a lifeline uh from A&Z.
>> Yeah. We were just you know burning a lot of cash. We weren't generating much revenue other than Spark Summit.
>> We had a lot of downloads. We had a lot of downloads.
>> A lot of downloads
>> and recurring conference revenue.
>> Yeah. and recurring.
>> How confident were you in that time when when things were at their level?
>> Oh, I mean I seriously considered taking the professor job at Berkeley because uh I you know I seriously thought this was going to be very very hard to pull off. Um you know it's like you know I think the sentiment at data bricks was or at least my sentiment was uh look you you win some things you lose some things in life. We created Apache Spark and we made it a worldwide sensation. Everybody's downloading the downloads are through the roof. We have this greatest conference like you know thousands of people come to our conference. It's awesome. Let's go back. Let's do it again. Let's publish another paper and do those kind of things. We're just not business guys. We just don't understand business. You know, that's okay. You know, we don't want to be business guys. So, uh so that's kind of how I felt about it, right? Uh but uh what I knew was that hey, um you know,
>> by the way, every mate went back and became a professor. Like all all this stuff happened.
>> Yeah. Yan went back, you know, and um but uh you know, in 2015,
>> we knew that we had tried everything. And by the way, PLG is something that we had tried very hard and it didn't work for us.
>> Like you know, actually one of our biggest failures was PLG at data bricks. Everybody kept telling us PLG, PLG, PLG. And we're like, okay, product growth and Amazon didn't just swipe their credit cards. We don't need sales people. Um but so in 2015, I had kind of like
>> Except Cranny.
>> Exactly. Yes, that is true. Uh kudos to Mark. So that year we had like formed some hypothesis that uh you know we have nothing to lose. Uh what if we just pivoted these things? What if we went all in into B2B enterprise sales you know cuz certainly it's not PLG is not working you know at 3 million AR that's not going to take you anywhere. Um and you know and they're just taking our open source software so we have to have proprietary code around it you know and yeah the execs team are all PhDs you know. So what if we bring in someone that doesn't have a PhD and see how it goes. So, so
>> I never forget Arcelon going, "We made the number." And I was like, "You made a ridiculous number." Like, you made the number. Like, if you keep making that number, you're going to go bankrupt. Like, that you didn't make the number. You made a number that you set that was way too low. Like, we haven't figured it out.
>> Ben was very nice and complimentary in our board meetings that year, 2015. You know,
>> we were Yeah, we we were in a bit of trouble.
>> Let's say it was very truthing. Uh, but uh but yeah, so we had nothing to lose. So we didn't know that we were going to succeed, but we had nothing to lose to make those big changes and we made them in 2016. And it turned out those were the bottlenecks. You know, giving away your software for free. Uh not having execs that have seen the movie before like Ron who came in and um you know um just uh the PLG motion is not going to cut it. So maybe we should just try. We weren't certain that B2B would work, but we knew that PLG is not working for sure.
>> Yeah. Well, another like I mean you know we got Ron I mean like the fact that the first sales guy we hired was a sales savant like a genius. Shock. I mean like that never happens. And and he was a guy we didn't know. Like we like our talent team like found him some from some company we never heard of.
>> Yeah. French company. And the only
>> really the only reason we hired him was because he was the only guy Cranny ever liked. Like in all the sales guys he ever interviewed, he was like this is the guy.
>> Wow.
>> And
>> yeah, he he is a new generation more cr but we just like stumbled into him. Yeah. Yeah. Like unbelievable. And
>> without Ron
>> very hard to see us this company getting to where it got to.
>> So there's some luck involved in us even finding him. Uh but then that he was phenomenal and also kudos to Yan who actually led the search in 2015. Uh so you know um but uh yeah Ron was game changing for us but Ron was a very uncomfortable uh hire
>> because he did not have a PhD
>> and uh he
>> did have an engineering degree. Yeah, he does have an engineering degree from Stanford that helped a little bit, but uh but he's he's a sales, you know, true and true sales guy like he's not a, you know, he's not one of these he's he's a classic sales person, right? Who grew up in sales um even though he has an engineering degree. So, um the comfortable thing would have been to pick someone and we had some candidates in the mix who were super technical using the product, giving us feedback, but they probably would not and that would have been much more comfortable for us.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh
>> yeah, Ron was uncomfortable. He was a very uncomfortable hireer and he made it very uncomfortable for us for many years and he still does.
>> But that's a lot of the key to the company.
>> Yeah.
>> Is it forces it forces a customer focus that would be impossible to have without somebody that smart and crafty
>> about getting his way. I mean just like unbelievable.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> If you can keep also the original team together that's important. We were, you know, seven co-founders still. Many of the co-founders like, you know, you said data warehousing was a big push for us. My co-founder Reynold was really the one that kind of pushed this.
>> Yeah. Like, well, the the contribution level from a large number of co-founders is unique in the industry. I mean, you've got Patrick, you have Rainald, you have Mate, you have Arcelon. I mean, like, it's it's crazy how much
>> the original team contributes.
>> Yeah. So the PhDs all contribute like Arson really made the go to market work you know and he really made the sort of Ron work with the rest of the company that was super critical mate continued doing lots of innovations over the years Patrick led all of engineering in big chunks of it and you know so on and we've had other people we've been lucky to get such folks so hiring is critical and keeping the original talent I think those were some of the things
>> yeah usually founders usually only one of the co-founders contributes long term and so to have you know to have that going and Yan's still on the board and Scott's still on the board. I mean, like, it's very unusual.
>> Yeah, we have a lot more we can get into, but we're at time, so we'll leave it for future episodes of Boss Talk, but this is a great first episode.
>> All right, that was fun. Thanks so much. Thank you so much, guys. [Music]
