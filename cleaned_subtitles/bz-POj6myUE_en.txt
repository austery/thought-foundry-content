You've also built a custom GBT to make sure that your writing is concise. So, can you show us a little bit of what that looks like? I've been giving feedback multiple times and my writing is good, but it can be really long. So, my Slack messages on updates and channels are really long and it's hard for people to get through. And Lenny released a newsletter where you had Wes Cow say her recommendations on how to write concisely, how to deliver message. Well, I took these newsletters, I command Ped it, downloaded them, and I put it into a custom GPT as my guidelines to how to write. And then you have this here, this instructions. GPT rewrites Slack messages to be more concise, to be more clear, to be readable, maintains the natural voice of the user because I want anyone in my company, anyone in general to use this GPT so it doesn't like make it super AI, avoid too much dashes, don't give so much bullet points, all that stuff like that. And then I come into here so often, I'll write a message out on Slack to like myself. I'll copy it, paste it in here, and it does a really good job of making it super concise, sticking to these guidelines up, delivering to the point, having a really good follow-up and leadup as to what the next section will be. It is a lifesaver. People respond to my Slack messages more
