What do you think of
when you see this forest?
Maybe you think of ways
the forest could be useful to us.
Maybe as a source
of timber or a fuel wood,
or maybe as a store of carbon
with which we can tackle climate change.
And all of these are useful
and sometimes necessary ways of thinking
about a forest or any ecosystem.
Or maybe, just maybe, you feel
something more mysterious and wondrous.
Maybe you have an inkling of a world
far more ancient than our young species.
A world full of beings
that communicate in languages
of sound and chemistry and light,
that we barely understand.
A world that needs
to be approached with humility.
In this world,
plants perform the everyday miracle
of turning light and air into life,
and that energy that captured sunshine
then cascades from plant to animal
to fungus to bacterium.
And on the way,
it carries great currents of carbon,
nitrogen and other essential nutrients
that together build the web of life
that is that ecosystem.
And the same applies
at the scale of the planet.
The planet is the sum
of the world's ecosystems,
but it is so much more.
It is an interconnected and shimmering web
of flows of carbon
and energy and nutrients
that build up the ancient matrix
that is our home,
from which we have emerged
as a species that nurtures us,
on which we depend utterly.
I'm an ecosystem ecologist,
and I study this world
of flows and interactions.
And together with a team
of ecologists around the world,
we measure and map the flows of energy,
of carbon and nutrients
that build up the ecosystem.
Starting with the capture
of sunshine by plants,
we follow those flows of energy
to build the biomass of trees,
and we follow that energy down
into the roots and fungi
and into the soil,
and then beyond the plants and fungi,
into the creatures of the soil,
the worms, the invertebrates,
by measuring the abundance
of each creature,
we can map and calculate
these flows of energy.
And we find every life form
a miracle of evolution.
Sometimes our approaches
take the latest technologies,
such as acoustic sensors or camera traps,
coupled with artificial
intelligence tools.
Sometimes we use more
traditional approaches,
such as counting birds
in a rainforest at dawn,
that require training
and expertise and dedication and passion.
And with this type of work,
we're able to build up a map
of the flows that make up an ecosystem.
So to take an example
of this English woodland
just outside of Oxford,
we can calculate that 60 percent
of that captured sunshine
pours down into the trunks of the trees.
A smaller fraction
pours down from the trees
through the roots into the soil.
Another pathway into the soil
is falling leaves in the autumn,
or falling fruit.
Of all that plant material,
a fraction is consumed
by plant-eating animals,
and a smaller fraction of that is consumed
by animal-eating animals,
and so the web of life
is built and maintained.
And by doing this work
in various ecosystems,
we learn some things.
One thing we learn is that the resilience
and health of an ecosystem
is determined both by the total
amount of flow of energy,
but also by how complex
that flow of energy is,
how many species it passes through.
And I call this complex flow
of energy the spread of energy,
the vibrancy of an ecosystem.
In our current work,
we're also trying to go
from individual ecosystems
to the scale of the whole living planet,
the biosphere.
Here's one example which we seek
to look at the biosphere
through these biological eyes.
And this is a map of the intensity
of biological activity
on the land surface.
And this is for July,
and the world looks vaguely familiar.
Africa looks a bit strange,
the Sahara has shriveled away to nothing,
the southern hemispheres have shrunk away.
This is January and look
how different the world is.
The Northern hemisphere has shriveled away
into its deep, dark winter.
The world is dominated by the magnificent
metabolism of the tropics.
We live on a tropical planet.
Just look how large Kenya is there
compared to all of Europe biologically.
And we can do this
for every month of the year.
And so get a glimpse of the great
green heartbeat of energy and life
that powers and nourishes
all life on this planet Earth.
(Applause)
And through this work,
I can tell you some
really interesting science.
And I'm here to tell you
some of those scientific stories,
but I'm here to do more than that.
I also want to argue
that this vibrancy of the living world
is something that we don't
pay enough attention to
when we think of how
we work with nature
to tackle the environmental
challenges we face.
In conservation,
we may focus excessively on particular
charismatic species like elephants,
or we may focus instead
on what nature can do for us,
its ecosystem services.
And we don't pay enough attention
to the webs of energy and life
that hold everything together.
So when we look at the world
through these vibrancy eyes,
some surprises can emerge.
Vibrant ecosystems don't
have to be places empty of people.
Many cultures, traditional cultures,
Indigenous people, smallholder farmers,
live in places fizzing
with ecological energy.
And many agricultural systems,
regenerative systems and others,
can also buzz with ecological energy.
The absence of people is not
the highest state of nature.
We need it in some places perhaps,
but in many places people
can and do build vibrant nature
and we need to work with those energies.
We have also learned
what is not a vibrant ecosystem.
Images such as this,
endless rows of trees,
perhaps planted for timber
or for carbon capture,
the richness of life
reduced to a single function.
All that vibrant flow of energy channeled
and canalized into a single species.
This is not a forest.
And yet, when we think of working
with nature to tackle climate change,
we're in danger sometimes of focusing
too much on the carbon value of nature.
And carbon has a role.
Certainly, there are situations where
it can help us mitigate climate change
and at the same time raise
finance that can help us protect
or restore natural ecosystems.
But if we go too far,
if we focus on carbon,
when we stop it being a tool
and it starts becoming a worldview,
then we're in danger of reducing
the infinities of nature
into some sort of carbon machine
that we can dial up and down.
Here's another example of this.
This is a landscape,
and you may look at this
and see all of those open,
treeless spaces and think,
well, maybe this is an opportunity
for tree planting.
Trees are inherently good
and they absorb carbon,
and maybe you can offset
your company's carbon emissions
with an extensive tree
planting program here.
But this is a savannah.
And the savannah is rich precisely
because of the lack of trees.
It's those grasses that grow in the open
spaces that provide, nourish life,
provide for life-regenerating fires,
and support the unique and charismatic
biodiversity that is the savannah.
This should not be a focus
for intensive tree planting
for carbon capture and climate mitigation.
We need to work with
vibrancy of the Earth.
But why does vibrancy matter?
For many reasons.
But I think one of the reasons
is that it gives ecosystems
and all of us who depend on ecosystems,
our best chance to adapt
and cope with aspects of the tide
of global change that is engulfing us,
including from climate change.
And I'd like to show one final example,
which is the case of tropical atolls.
Atolls are low-lying islands,
less than one meter above sea level,
and are often characterized
as the first victims of climate change
destined to drown under the rising seas
in the next few decades.
Or are they?
We've just finished a project
where we've examined these island systems,
but rather than seeing them
as islands in isolation,
we've looked at them as integrated
and interconnected island reef systems.
And when we look at it that way,
that view makes all the difference.
So what we did is compare
wild islands with ghost islands.
And wild islands are places such as this,
where seabirds come in to nest on the soil
or in the branches of a native vegetation.
And ghost islands are places such as this.
Now this may look like your
archetypal holiday paradise
of swaying palm trees
and white sand and turquoise waters,
but this is an ecologically
depleted system,
its vibrancy is dimmed.
Why is that, I hear some of you ask.
It's because many of these places
were once coconut plantations
for an extensive coconut oil
industry on these islands,
which has now largely collapsed,
these plantations are abandoned.
But the coconut is overgrowing
and suppressing the return
of native vegetation.
And also many of these islands
are densely populated by rats
brought in by sailors,
which eat out the eggs of seabirds
and prevent the seabirds from nesting.
So in this project,
we followed the flow
of energy and nutrients
from the seabirds
through into the forest
and then beyond the forest,
into the surrounding reef.
And what we found
is that on the wild islands,
the seabirds harvested fish
for hundreds of kilometers
and brought in the nutrients
in those fish to the islands
where they deposited
those nutrients in their poop,
their guano, that fertilized the island.
The poop and the guano
then washed off into the surrounding reef
and increased the rate
of growth of the coral,
and also the rate at which
the coral bounced back
from bleaching events
linked to heat waves.
And those higher nutrients also
supported a higher abundance of fish.
And of particular importance
are the parrotfish,
which with their beaks,
they eat away at the dead coral
to get at the algae inside,
and in the process,
they poop out the coral as sand
and that parrotfish poop, that sand,
then washes up to create the island.
And what we found
is that about up to 85 percent
of the sand on these islands
originated as parrotfish poop.
If you're lucky enough
to find yourself on a sandy, white,
tropical island beach,
think about the parrotfish
and be grateful.
(Laughter)
But we also found the native vegetation
doing extraordinary things
that, in just one square meter of soil,
the plants produced
20 kilometers of fine roots,
and those roots bound the sand together
and can turn that sand
into nourishing soil.
And so the forest was able to grow
and the island to grow alongside it.
So what we were able to do in this project
is describe this flow of energy
and sediment and nutrients
from birds to island to reef
and then back to islands.
And when we put all our numbers together,
we calculated that a wild island,
a vibrant island,
full of seabirds, of native vegetation
and fish that aren't overharvested,
those islands were able to grow
at rates that keep up with mid-level
scenarios of sea-level rise.
But a depleted island,
diminished in its vibrancy,
would struggle much more
and is much more likely to drown
under the rising tides.
But there are limits to this adaptation.
The extreme levels of sea level rise
would be hard to cope with,
so we shouldn't use signs of adaptation
as an excuse to not tackle the urgency
of tackling climate change
and sea-level rise.
So the lesson that comes from this project
is that we need to work with the vibrancy
of these atoll systems
to maintain and restore
that vibrancy where we can,
to give them their best chance
of coping with climate change
and for the communities
that depend on them
also to have the best chance
of coping with rising sea level.
And I think there's a wider principle
that's being emerged here.
It's just harder to see
in most ecosystems,
which are much more spatially
entangled and much more complex,
like this rainforest here in the Amazon,
where it's really hard
to predict the details
of how ecosystems are going to respond
to the tide of global change
that is engulfing them,
whether from climate change
or from the other factors.
What we do know is that the more
we can work with the wild energies
of these ecosystems,
the more we can maintain
and rebuild their vibrancy,
the best chance they have to cope
with the change that is coming
and adapt to that change,
and the best chance we have,
as all who are dependent
on these ecosystems,
to adapt to that change.
And that applies to wild
and semi-wild ecosystems,
but I believe it also
applies to our agricultural systems
and our urban landscapes as well.
And this applies at the scale
of the planet, the living Earth.
We need to work with
the energies of the biosphere
to regenerate and restore them,
to have a world that is vibrant
and as possible,
not a biosphere that is
commodified and packaged
and industrialized
to be subservient to human needs,
but are resilient and regenerative planet
where both humans
and the rest of life on Earth
can thrive and flourish.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
