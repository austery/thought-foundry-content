哈嘍 大家好  
Hello everyone  
我是莊也  
I'm Zhuang Ye  
歡迎您收看莊也雜談  
Welcome to Zhuang Ye Talks  
今天  
Today  
咱們聊一聊觀眾們點播非常多的  
Let's talk about something that has been highly requested by viewers  
非常有可能當選加拿大下任總理的  
A very likely candidate to become Canada's next Prime Minister  
保守黨黨魁博勵治  
The leader of the Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre  
以及在他領導之下的保守黨  
And the Conservative Party under his leadership  
有什麼樣的一個執政理念  
What kind of governing philosophy they may pursue  
為什麼說這個話題  
Why are we discussing this topic  
不僅僅是因為觀眾點播的比較多  
Not just because it's a popular request from viewers  
還有一個原因  
There's another reason  
就是因為上集節目  
It's because in the last episode  
咱們說那個加拿大加入美國的話題  
We discussed the topic of Canada joining the United States  
我看觀眾的反饋留言裡面  
I saw in the viewers' feedback comments  
有點出乎我的意料之外  
There were some unexpected responses
我發現  
I found that  
好像有一半以上的留言的觀眾  
It seems that more than half of the viewers in the comments  
對加拿大加入美國這個事非常嚮往  
are very eager for the idea of Canada joining the United States  
非常感興趣  
and very interested in it  
並且對於我話裡話外的  
and also quite upset with my implied stance  
似乎不支持加拿大加入美國  
seemingly not supporting Canada joining the U.S.  
這種這種站位  
on this position  
就感到非常的氣憤  
they feel very upset about it  
說話有不好聽的  
Some even said harsh things  
這個我得聲明一下  
I need to clarify this  
其實我並沒有說旗幟鮮明的  
In fact, I never explicitly said  
堅決反對加拿大加入美國  
that I strongly oppose Canada joining the U.S.  
沒有我節目中我只是說  
I simply stated in my show  
美加合併這件事在客觀上很難辦到  
that objectively, the merger between Canada and the U.S. is difficult to achieve  
至於為什麼難  
As for why it's difficult  
是因為這六大原因等等等等  
it's due to six major reasons, etc.  
我可沒說堅決反對  
I didn’t say I strongly oppose it  
你可別誤會  
Don't misunderstand me  
我儘量是  
I try to be  
持一個中立客觀的態度  
neutral and objective in my approach  
看待美加合併這件事情  
when it comes to the idea of Canada merging with the U.S.  
如果真的是全國民調都同意  
If national polls were to show agreement  
那我一樣  
then I would also  
雙手贊成  
give my full support  
樂見其成  
and be happy to see it happen  
我有什麼好反對的 是吧  
What would I have to oppose, right?  
不過  
However  
我看到有些人說贊成加拿大加入美國  
I saw some people saying they support Canada joining the U.S.  
他的理由就是  
Their reason is that  
只是對加拿大的現狀不滿意  
they are simply dissatisfied with the current state of Canada  
因為左棍橫行毀了現在的加拿大  
because left-wing extremists have ruined Canada today  
因此交給美國無可厚非  
so it's understandable to hand it over to the U.S.  
這個邏輯其實我是完全不同意的  
I completely disagree with this logic  
難道  
Is it really the case that  
加拿大除了您說的這個左棍橫行之外  
besides the left-wing extremism you mentioned,  
就沒有其他的政治力量來撥亂反正嗎  
there are no other political forces that can restore order?  
難道除了交給特朗普  
Is the only option really to hand it over to Trump?  
那加拿大就沒有其他的路可走了嗎  
Does that mean Canada has no other path?  
當然不是  
Of course not  
咱們今天就來看一看加拿大未來的希望  
Today, let's explore Canada's future possibilities  
下一屆加拿大總理的最熱門的人選  
The most popular candidate for the next Canadian prime minister  
保守黨的黨魁  
The leader of the Conservative Party  
這位論外貌  
In terms of appearance  
不輸特魯多  
he's no less attractive than Trudeau  
論歲數更加的年富力強  
In terms of age, he's more energetic and youthful  
論思維比特魯多更加的敏捷  
In terms of thinking, he is more agile than Trudeau  
論價值觀  
In terms of values  
比特魯多是更加正常的  
his values are much more reasonable than Trudeau's  
噠噠 保守黨黨魁博勵治  
And now, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party
以及在他領導下的保守黨  
And the Conservative Party under his leadership  
對未來的加拿大的走向  
The direction of Canada's future  
秉持一種什麼樣的治國理念  
What kind of governing philosophy they hold for the future  
相信聽完今天的介紹  
I believe after today's introduction  
你一定會對加拿大的未來充滿信心  
you will definitely be filled with confidence about Canada's future  
那咱們先簡單介紹一下  
Now, let's briefly introduce  
博勵治這個人的個人背景  
the personal background of Pierre Poilievre  
他的名字  
His name  
這個挺難寫的  
This one is quite hard to write  
這麼寫發音是這麼念  
This is how it's written, and it's pronounced like this.
in French or in French Canadian
his name would be said as ....
in English to say his name as ....
然後  
Then,  
咱們再說一說他的中文名稱"博勵治"  
Let's talk about his Chinese name, "博勵治".  
不過值得一提的是  
However, it's worth mentioning that  
這個中文名字  
this Chinese name  
其實並非是經過他官方正式確認的  
was not officially confirmed by him.  
而是一些個別的華語媒體按照音譯  
Instead, some individual Chinese media outlets transliterated it  
把它寫成這三個字  
and wrote it as these three characters.  
然後就傳開了  
Then it spread.  
當然  
Of course,  
也有些人認為博勵治這個“治”字  
some people believe the "治" character in 博勵治  
應該換成“志向”的“志”  
should be replaced with the character "志" (meaning aspiration).  
這更符合他的政治形象  
This would better align with his political image.  
這不就能體現“勵志”嗎  
This would reflect the meaning of "inspiring".  
鼓舞人的寓意  
It carries an inspiring connotation.  
當然了甭管是博勵治還是博勵志  
Of course, whether it's 博勵治 or 博勵志  
無所謂  
it doesn't matter.  
當然還有人喜歡直來直去  
Some people also prefer to be straightforward  
按照他的名字的首字母簡寫PP  
and use the initials of his name, PP.  
就叫他皮皮  
They just call him "Pipi".  
所以說  
So,  
怎麼叫都成  
it doesn't matter what you call him.  
反正他本人沒有確認過  
Anyway, he hasn't confirmed it himself.  
不過咱們今天為了說起來方便  
But for convenience, today,  
咱們就叫他博勵治  
we'll call him 博勵治.  
博勵治這個人  
This person, 博勵治,  
你看他這個姓  
you see his last name  
Poilievre  
Poilievre,  
他這個姓一看  
at first glance, his last name  
一般人都會以為他是一個法裔出身  
would make most people think he is of French descent.  
但實際上  
But in fact,  
他的生理種族並不是法裔  
his ethnic background is not French.  
他其實是愛爾蘭裔  
He is actually of Irish descent.  
他是1979年的6月3日  
He was born on June 3, 1979.  
出生在阿省的卡爾加里  
He was born in Calgary, Alberta.  
今年剛好45歲  
He is 45 years old this year.  
他的生母名字叫做Jacqueline Farrell  
His biological mother's name was Jacqueline Farrell.  
傑奎琳.法雷爾  
Jacqueline Farrell.  
有媒體報導  
Some media reports  
就是這位法雷爾女士最近剛剛去世  
say that Ms. Farrell passed away recently.  
其實這個法雷爾家  
In fact, the Farrell family  
他是愛爾蘭裔的加拿大人  
is of Irish-Canadian descent.  
博勵治他的外祖父名字叫做Patrick Farrell  
Poilievre's grandfather's name was Patrick Farrell.  
就是帕特里克.法雷爾  
His name was Patrick Farrell.  
他是1953年從愛爾蘭移民加拿大的  
He immigrated to Canada from Ireland in 1953.  
在1979年 這位老法雷爾先生  
In 1979, this elderly Mr. Farrell  
他16歲的女兒傑奎琳  
had a 16-year-old daughter, Jacqueline.  
生下了一個男孩  
She gave birth to a boy.  
這個男孩就是博勵治  
This boy was Pierre Poilievre.  
但是傑奎琳沒有辦法撫養這個男孩  
But Jacqueline was unable to raise him.  
因為傑奎琳當時還是一位高中生  
Because she was still a high school student at the time.  
我猜 肯定看到這有人會問  
I guess someone will ask at this point,  
那這個博勵治  
So, who is Poilievre's biological father?  
他的生物學的父親到底是誰  
Who is his biological father?  
這個你甭猜了  
Well, don't guess.  
目前這個信息並未對外公開披露  
This information has not been made public.  
對外披露的只有他母親的信息  
Only information about his mother has been disclosed.  
他母親剛生下他的時候  
When his mother had just given birth to him,  
原本打算給他起名叫做Jeff， Jeff Farrell  
she initially planned to name him Jeff, Jeff Farrell.  
只不過後來因為他被收養了嘛  
However, later he was adopted,  
於是這個名字也就被塵封了起來  
and thus, this name was sealed away.  
儘管  
Even though  
後來博勵治也曾經提到過這個名字  
Poilievre has mentioned this name later on  
能夠提醒他這個不同尋常的身世  
as a reminder of his extraordinary background.  
這個孩子生下來之後  
After this child was born,  
就被一對教師夫妻收養  
he was adopted by a teacher couple.  
他的養父母給他起的正式的名字  
His adoptive parents gave him the formal name  
就是現在咱們看到的這個Pierre  
which is the Pierre we know today.
後來博勵治的媽媽傑奎琳  
Later, Pierre Poilievre's mother, Jacqueline,  
又一次懷孕生下來的第二個兒子  
became pregnant again and gave birth to her second son.  
也就是博勵治的同母異父的兄弟  
This was Pierre Poilievre's half-brother, from the same mother but a different father.  
也被這對好心的教師夫妻給收養了  
He was also adopted by this kind and caring teacher couple.  
這裡  
Here,  
咱們簡單說一下他這個養父母  
let's briefly talk about his adoptive parents.  
這對教師  
They were both teachers.  
這是一對來自薩斯卡徹溫省的  
This couple came from Saskatchewan.  
法裔加拿大家庭  
They were from a French-Canadian family.  
他的養父母的名字分別是Marlene Poilievre  
His adoptive parents' names were Marlene Poilievre  
和這個Donald Poilievre  
and Donald Poilievre.  
這位女教師是不是法裔咱們不清楚  
It's unclear whether the female teacher was of French descent,  
但是他這個家庭中的男主人  
but the male head of the household was certainly a French-Canadian.  
他確定是一個法裔的加拿大人  
He was confirmed to be a French-Canadian.  
博勵治就是在這對教師夫妻  
Pierre Poilievre grew up in this teacher couple's  
位於卡爾加里市郊的  
home on the outskirts of Calgary.  
一個普通的家庭環境中長大  
It was a typical family environment.  
咱們前面也說了  
As we mentioned earlier,  
這對夫婦  
this couple  
後來還收養了博勵治同母異父的弟弟Patrick  
later adopted Pierre Poilievre's half-brother, Patrick.  
這兩個男孩子  
The two boys,  
兄弟倆 在這個法裔家庭中  
grew up in this French-Canadian household  
從小接受的是法語和英語的雙語教育  
and received bilingual education in both French and English.  
並且在文化上  
Culturally,  
深受法裔天主教文化的影響  
they were heavily influenced by French Catholic culture.  
正是這種多元文化背景  
It was this multicultural background  
使博勵治本人對加拿大的多樣性  
that gave Pierre Poilievre a deep understanding of Canada's diversity.  
有了一個深刻的理解  
He developed a profound appreciation for it.  
後來在博勵治12歲左右的時候  
Later, when Pierre Poilievre was around 12 years old,  
養父母的婚姻破裂了  
his adoptive parents' marriage fell apart.  
至於離婚的原因  
As for the reason for the divorce,  
是因為博勵治的養父Donald Poilievre  
it was because Pierre Poilievre's adoptive father, Donald Poilievre,  
是一個同性戀  
was a gay man.  
所以說家庭就分了  
So, the family broke apart.  
雖說一般情況下  
Although in most cases,  
離婚都會引起家庭的矛盾  
divorce causes family conflicts,  
以及家人之間的各種紛爭  
and various disputes among family members,  
但是他們家比較和諧  
this family remained relatively harmonious.  
雖說養父母兩口子離婚了  
Although his adoptive parents divorced,  
但是博勵治與他的這對養父母  
Pierre Poilievre maintained good relationships with both of his adoptive parents  
包括他養父後來的男性伴侶  
as well as his adoptive father's later male partner.  
這些人之間 都保持著比較融洽的關係  
All of them maintained cordial relations.  
隨後在博勵治20多歲的時候  
Later, in his twenties,  
他又找到了自己的  
he reconnected with his  
親生母親和外祖父  
biological mother and grandfather.  
就是他跟他的血親家庭之間  
This meant he also rebuilt ties with his biological family.  
也建立了很好的聯繫  
He established a strong connection with them.  
他第一次見到他親媽的時候  
The first time he met his biological mother,  
就是這個傑奎琳  
Jacqueline,  
當時這個傑奎琳  
Jacqueline, at that time,  
是在美國的北卡羅萊納州  
was working as a nurse in North Carolina, USA.  
當一名護士  
She was a nurse.  
見到母親的同時  
When he saw his mother,  
也見到了自己的外祖父  
he also met his grandfather.  
後來博勵治  
Later, Pierre Poilievre  
在2022年贏得保守黨黨魁選舉的當晚上  
won the Conservative Party leadership election in 2022.  
除了2017年去世的外祖父之外  
Except for his grandfather, who passed away in 2017,  
其他所有跟他有關係的這些親戚們  
all the other relatives who were related to him  
都出席了這場盛會  
attended this grand event.  
你看  
As you can see,  
咱們講他之前的這些家庭的經歷  
talking about his previous family experiences,  
其實對他個人的成長和價值觀  
In fact, it had a profound influence on his personal growth and values.  
形成了深遠的影響  
It played a lasting role in shaping his worldview.  
博勵治實際上是從高中時候  
Poilievre actually showed a strong interest in politics since high school.  
就開始展現出對政治的濃厚興趣  
He began to show a strong passion for politics back then.  
他在學校裡  
While in school,  
就積極參加保守黨的青年學生組織  
he actively participated in the Conservative Party's youth organization.  
展現出對辯論  
showing a keen interest in debating  
演講以及社會活動這方面的熱情  
speech-making and social activities.  
他這個人演講  
He was very skilled in public speaking.  
他非常擅長這個  
He was very good at it.  
而且思維特別的敏捷  
Moreover, his thinking was exceptionally quick.  
善於把一個複雜的問題  
He was good at breaking down complex issues  
掰開了揉碎了  
and explaining them in simple, easy-to-understand terms.  
用一個非常淺顯易懂的語言表達出來  
He was able to express them in a very straightforward and clear language.  
然後在他1997年高中畢業之後  
Then, after graduating from high school in 1997,  
他進入了卡爾加里大學  
he entered the University of Calgary,  
學習國際關係和商業文學這個專業  
where he studied International Relations and Business Literature.  
後來拿到了學士學位  
Later, he earned his bachelor's degree.  
他在大學期間  
During his university years,  
他同樣  
he also  
積極投身于各種校園政治活動  
actively engaged in various campus political activities.  
參加大學裡的這個保守黨的社團  
He joined the Conservative Party club at his university.  
並開始在當地社區裡面  
and began to campaign for Conservative Party candidates in the local community.  
為保守黨這個候選人拉票  
He helped with campaigning for Conservative candidates.  
正是在大學期間  
It was during his university years  
他與不少保守黨的老黨員  
that he formed strong relationships with senior Conservative Party members  
以及年輕的政治活躍分子們打成一片  
and young political activists,  
後來為他從政結下了深厚的政治人脈  
which laid the foundation for his future political connections.  
大學畢業之後  
After graduating from university,  
就是在2002年左右  
around 2002,  
他就離開了自己的故鄉卡爾加里  
he left his hometown of Calgary  
搬到了渥太華  
and moved to Ottawa.  
並且在政壇找到了工作  
He soon found a job in politics,  
擔任一位政治大咖的顧問  
working as an advisor to a prominent politician.  
這麼年輕就當顧問了  
Becoming an advisor at such a young age  
不簡單  
is no small feat.  
至於是哪位政治大咖  
As for who the prominent politician was,  
就是當年一個如日中天的  
it was none other than the then rising star  
加拿大右翼政黨  
of the Canadian right-wing party,  
“加拿大聯盟”的領導人  
the leader of the "Canadian Alliance,"  
斯托克韋爾·戴 (Stockwell Day)  
Stockwell Day.  
他當Day先生的顧問  
He was an advisor to Mr. Day.  
然後  
Then,  
博勵治就一直居住在渥太華地區了  
Poilievre settled in the Ottawa area.  
順嘴咱們簡單說一下他的老闆Stockwell Day  
Just a quick note about his boss, Stockwell Day.  
加拿大聯盟的領導人  
He was the leader of the Canadian Alliance.  
估計說起這位Day先生您不知道  
You probably don’t know much about Mr. Day,  
他的下一任您肯定知道  
but you definitely know his successor.  
就是那個斯蒂芬.哈珀  
It was Stephen Harper.  
其實Day先生所在的這個"加拿大聯盟"  
Actually, the "Canadian Alliance" that Mr. Day was part of  
就是後來如日中天的  
would later become the powerful  
保守黨的前身之一  
precursor of the Conservative Party.  
後來在2003年的12月  
In December 2003,  
加拿大聯盟  
the Canadian Alliance  
和加拿大歷史上的這個"進步保守黨"  
merged with the Progressive Conservative Party in Canadian history,  
最終投票合併為今天的"加拿大保守黨"  
to form today's Conservative Party of Canada.  
而加拿大聯盟的領袖斯蒂芬.哈珀  
The leader of the Canadian Alliance, Stephen Harper,  
在次年2004年3月20日  
was elected the leader of the newly-formed Conservative Party on March 20, 2004.  
當選為新成立的加拿大保守黨的黨魁  
The following year, in 2006, he became the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada.  
後來大家都知道  
As we all know,  
哈珀是在2006年  
Harper was elected in 2006.  
當選為加拿大第22任總理  
He became the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada.  
好了 這個說遠了  
Alright, we’re getting off track here.  
咱們說回到這位博勵治  
Let's get back to Pierre Poilievre.  
博勵治是在2004年正式進入政壇  
Poilievre officially entered politics in 2004.  
年僅25歲的他  
At just 25 years old, he  
首次當選為渥太華地區的  
was first elected as a Member of Parliament for the Nepean-Carleton district in Ottawa  
尼賓卡爾頓選區（Nepean-Carleton）的下議院的議員  
to the House of Commons in the Nepean-Carleton riding.  
他也是當時國會中最年輕的議員  
He was also the youngest member of parliament at the time.  
在自此之後的20年中  
Over the next 20 years,  
歷經7次國會選舉  
he went through 7 federal elections.  
博勵治是一直勝選  
Poilievre consistently won each time.  
從未落選  
He never lost an election.  
就這麼牛叉  
He was that impressive.  
因此說  
So,  
咱們看這位博勵治先生  
looking at Mr. Poilievre,  
他其實就是一個天生的政客  
he is, in fact, a born politician.  
你別看他今年才45歲  
Don't be fooled by his age of 45,  
但是他的從政經歷已經超過20年了  
he's already had over 20 years of political experience.  
要是在算上大學期間  
If you count his time in university,  
那都超過27年了  
it's already been over 27 years.  
非常老資格的一位政客  
A very seasoned politician.  
好 咱們說回  
Now, back to the point,  
2004年博勵治剛進入議會的時候  
in 2004, when Poilievre first entered Parliament,  
他剛25歲嘛  
he was only 25 years old.  
很年輕  
He was very young.  
有句老話叫做 初生牛犢不怕虎  
There's an old saying, "A young calf is not afraid of a tiger."  
再加上他特別好鬥  
Plus, he was particularly combative,  
愛出風頭的這個性格  
and had a personality that loved to be in the spotlight.  
因此表現尤為搶眼  
As a result, he stood out even more.  
他特別敢於在這個議會辯論中  
He was especially bold in parliamentary debates,  
發表鮮明而且直接的觀點  
expressing strong and direct opinions.  
面對媒體也是毫不退縮  
He was also fearless when facing the media.  
因為他的這個思路清晰  
His thoughts were clear,  
語言犀利  
and his language was sharp.  
於是他迅速成為  
As a result, he quickly became  
保守黨的新生代的代表人物之一  
one of the new generation leaders of the Conservative Party.  
立刻在黨內是嶄露頭角  
He immediately stood out within the party.  
在哈珀政府時期  
During the Harper government,  
他曾擔任多個議會秘書職位  
he held several parliamentary secretary positions.  
後來在2013年到2015年間  
Later, from 2013 to 2015,  
擔任民主改革部的部長  
he served as Minister for Democratic Reform.  
在2015年  
In 2015,  
擔任就業和社會發展部部長的職務  
he became Minister of Employment and Social Development.  
為他積累了豐富的政治經驗  
This gave him a wealth of political experience.  
然而  
However,  
他的直率風格也引發了一些爭議  
his straightforward style also sparked some controversy.  
被部分人視為過于激進  
Some viewed him as overly radical.  
這個博勵治  
This Poilievre,  
他最引人注目的事情之一就是他  
one of the most striking things about him is his  
他過于自信  
extreme confidence.  
但這麼說是褒義詞  
But this is a compliment.  
如果您願意的話  
If you prefer,  
也可以用一個同義詞  
you can also use a synonym  
“盲目自大”來替換  
like “blind arrogance” to describe it.  
據一位不願意透露姓名的  
According to an unnamed  
保守黨的工作人員  
Conservative Party staff member,  
在博勵治2013年剛當部長的時候  
when Poilievre first became a minister in 2013,  
對博勵治的這個人的這個品行  
they described his character,  
就這麼描述  
saying his behavior was  
說他擔任部長的時候  
unbearable during his time as a minister.  
令人難以忍受  
He avoided anyone he thought was below his status.  
他迴避任何他認為地位低於他的人  
But this same anonymous Conservative staff member  
不過還是這位不願意透露姓名的  
later added,  
保守黨工作人員  
that although he was somewhat unsociable at the time,  
後來補充說  
he is much better now.  
雖說那個時候他比較不合群  
He's very different now compared to then.  
但是他現在好多了  
This shows that Poilievre himself  
跟以前相比有很大的不同  
can see the problems within himself and is willing to improve.  
這說明博勵治自己  
This shows that Poilievre himself  
還是能夠看清自己身上的問題  
is capable of seeing his own flaws  
並且能夠願意加以改進  
and is willing to make improvements.  
你看這個改進 後來的成果也顯而易見嘛  
And you can see the results of that improvement later on.  
在2022年的9月10日  
On September 10, 2022,  
他以壓倒性的優勢  
he won with an overwhelming majority,  
當選為保守黨的黨魁  
and became the leader of the Conservative Party.
和官方反對黨的領袖  
and the leader of the official opposition party
不過雖說他成功當選黨魁  
Although he successfully became the party leader
但是很多人並不看好他  
many people are not optimistic about him
認為這次保守黨選擇了他  
believing that the Conservative Party's choice of him
妥妥的就是“搬起石頭砸了自己的腳”  
is definitely like "picking up a stone and smashing their own foot."
為什麼這麼說  
Why is that?
因為博勵治這個人  
Because of Pierre Poilievre
他以直言不諱  
he is known for his bluntness
充滿激情的演講風格著稱  
and passionate speaking style.
善於辯論  
He is skilled in debate
敢於說話呀  
and is not afraid to speak his mind.
這樣的人很容易說錯話  
Such people are prone to saying the wrong things
很容易得罪人  
and easily offend others.
可能不利於保守黨的公眾形象  
This could be detrimental to the Conservative Party's public image.
就是因為這個博勵治  
Because of this, Poilievre
在議會辯論中  
in parliamentary debates
他這個人性就能看出來  
his personality is quite evident
他給人的印象最深的就是  
The strongest impression he leaves on people is
他比較好鬥  
that he is combative
所以很多人不看好他  
and that's why many people don’t have faith in him.
這個當然也不能怪他  
Of course, this cannot solely be blamed on him.
這跟他在保守黨陣營中擔負的角色  
This is tied to the role he plays in the Conservative camp.
是分不開的  
It's inseparable from that.
他的定位就是向對手發動進攻的那個  
His role is that of an attack dog against the opposition.
attack dog這種角色  
The "attack dog" role
如果是打排球的那叫主攻手  
is like the main attacker in volleyball
踢足球的那叫前鋒  
or a forward in soccer,
橄欖球那叫跑位  
a running back in football,
打棒球的那叫擊球手  
or a batter in baseball.
保守黨那叫博勵治  
For the Conservative Party, that's Pierre Poilievre.
就是這麼有特點  
He is just that distinctive.
他辯論的方式非常的犀利  
His debate style is very sharp.
更傾向于進攻而不是防守  
He is more inclined to attack rather than defend.
他總是按照自己的方式出牌  
He always plays his hand the way he wants,
而不是按照對手的節奏  
rather than following the opponent's rhythm.
被對手牽著鼻子走  
He doesn’t let the opponent lead him by the nose.
他比較習慣牽著對手的鼻子走  
He is more accustomed to leading his opponents.
再加上他知識儲備非常的豐富  
In addition, he has a vast store of knowledge.
博聞強記  
He is well-read and has a strong memory.
辯論的時候  
During debates
引經據典  
he cites references and quotes,
有理有據  
and presents strong, well-supported arguments.
表現出色  
He performs excellently.
各種數字是張嘴就來  
He can rattle off various numbers effortlessly.
所以說聽他辯論實際上是一個享受  
Listening to his debates is actually a pleasure.
特點非常的鮮明  
His traits are very distinct.
深受支持者們的喜愛  
He is greatly loved by his supporters.
但是對那些跟他辯論的對手來說  
But for his debate opponents,
跟他辯論就是一場災難  
debating him is a disaster.
經常把對方辯友給給折磨的張口結舌  
He often leaves his opponents speechless.
就感覺他這個人特別的粗魯  
It feels like he is extremely rude.
就是對手就說他  
His opponents say that he
他“習慣走到可接受的行為界限之上”  
“habitually crosses the line of acceptable behavior.”
就是踩到紅線了  
He steps over the red line.
“甚至可能稍微過頭一點”  
“Sometimes even goes a little too far.”
這個咱們舉個例子  
Let's take an example.
在2024年的4月30  
On April 30, 2024,
博勵治在眾議院的質詢環節  
Poilievre criticized Prime Minister Trudeau during a question period in the House of Commons.
他就批評總理特魯多  
He criticized Prime Minister Trudeau
當時打算在BC省試點  
who was planning to pilot a program in British Columbia
將某些硬性的毒品合法化的舉措  
to legalize certain hard drugs.
他就對特魯多以及他的這個政策  
He expressed strong discontent with Trudeau and his policy.
非常的不滿  
He was very dissatisfied.
雙方直接開罵  
The two sides directly began to argue.
當時博勵治  
At that moment, Poilievre
使用了這個“wacko”這個詞  
used the word "wacko."
這個詞是一個貶義詞  
This word is a derogatory term.
直譯過來就是瘋子精神病  
Literally translated, it means crazy or mentally ill.
當然這個詞的意思  
Of course, the meaning of the word
並不是那種真正的精神病人  
doesn’t refer to a real mentally ill person,
而是那種怎麼說  
but rather someone who seems
腦子進水  
to be out of their mind
大腦短路  
or mentally short-circuited,
看上去很古怪的  
someone with very bizarre and strange thinking.
怪異的那種思維不正常的人  
A person with abnormal and eccentric thought patterns.
於是聽到這個詞  
So when he heard this term,  
當時這個眾議院的議長  
at that time, the Speaker of the House,  
這個Greg Fergus  
Greg Fergus,  
就認為博勵治的言論不可接受  
he thought Poilievre's remarks were unacceptable.  
要求他立刻撤回  
He demanded that Poilievre retract them immediately.  
博勵治那性格  
But Poilievre's character…  
那能撤回嗎  
Could he retract them?  
只表示他同意  
He only agreed to use the words “extreme” or “radical”  
用“極端”或者是“激進”兩個詞  
to replace the word “wacko”.  
來替換這個wacko  
But of course, that still didn’t work.  
那當然也不行了  
Then, after Poilievre refused to retract his remarks four times,  
然後  
the Speaker, Mr. Fergus,  
就是在博勵治4次拒絶撤回言論之後  
cited “using inappropriate language” as a reason,  
這個議長Fergus  
and expelled Poilievre from the House for the rest of the day.  
就以“使用非議會要求的語言”為由  
This move sparked a collective protest from Conservative MPs.  
把博勵治在當天的剩餘時間內  
Another example  
逐出議會  
is from a video interview he gave a year ago.  
此舉  
This video was posted on his YouTube channel,  
也是引發了保守黨議員們的集體抗議  
resulting in viral spread.  
另外還有一個例子  
By now, it has reached 1.2 million views.  
就是他在一年前接受一個採訪的視頻  
Why did it go viral?  
這個視頻他發在自己的油管頻道上了  
Because during the entire interview,  
結果造成了視頻病毒式的傳播  
he casually ate an apple while being interviewed.  
截止現在已經有1.2M（百萬）的觀看量  
Even while eating,  
為什麼這麼火呀  
Poilievre remained calm and composed.  
因為在整個的採訪過程中  
Why did he eat?  
他一邊接受採訪  
Many analysts believe it was intentional.  
一邊漫不經心的吃蘋果  
He used this indifferent attitude  
但是即使是吃蘋果  
to deal with reporters he didn’t like.  
博勵治  
It was a clear act of performance art.  
他始終保持著一個冷靜和鎮定的舉止  
Many reporters have a habit of being biased  
那他為什麼要吃  
or asking shallow questions.  
其實很多人分析他是故意的  
Poilievre really dislikes this behavior.  
用這種漫不經心的態度  
So if you’re allowed to ask silly questions,  
來對待那些他不喜歡的採訪記者  
then he is allowed to answer while casually eating an apple.  
妥妥的是一個行為藝術  
It was certainly a performance piece.  
因為很多記者有個毛病  
Many reporters have this issue—  
就是在提問中  
they often display prejudice in their questions.  
就會無來由的表現出一些偏見  
Or they ask shallow questions.  
或者是缺乏深度的一些提問  
Poilievre really dislikes this.  
這個博勵治就特別討厭這種人  
Pierre Poilievre really dislikes people like this  
那既然允許你們提問的時候不過腦子  
Since you're allowed to ask questions without thinking  
那也就允許我在回答你們的時候  
then I should be allowed to answer while  
亢哧亢哧吃蘋果  
crunching on an apple  
哈哈看得我這個過癮  
Haha, this is so satisfying to watch  
很多網友表示看了這個視頻之後  
Many netizens said they became fans of Poilievre after watching this video  
迅速被博勵治圈粉  
quickly becoming his supporters  
因此說我建議你也可以看一看  
So, I suggest you check it out too  
所以說你看  
So, you see  
從上面說的這些小故事中  
From the little stories mentioned above  
可以看出來博勵治這個人的個人特點  
you can see Pierre Poilievre's personal traits  
他的這些特點  
These traits of his  
不一定會讓他成為一個深受歡迎的總理  
won't necessarily make him a widely loved prime minister  
事實也是如此  
And the facts prove this  
根據華爾街日報的報導  
According to the Wall Street Journal  
目前加拿大民眾對他的好感度  
currently, Canadians' opinions of him  
依然是兩極分化  
are still polarized  
甚至那些對他持負面看法的人  
In fact, those with negative views of him  
大概還多一些  
probably outnumber those who support him  
最高曾經達到過55%  
It peaked at 55%  
但是隨著他的曝光率越來越高  
But as his exposure increases  
現在反對他的人也應該是逐漸減少  
the number of people opposing him should gradually decrease  
那當然  
Of course,  
還是有不少人不喜歡他  
there are still many people who don't like him  
什麼原因  
Why is that?  
我認為是兩個原因  
I believe there are two reasons  
第一這個人的個人風格比較激進  
First, his personal style is quite radical  
他主張民粹主義的經濟政策  
He advocates for populist economic policies  
而且說話的時候不苟言笑  
And when he speaks, he is serious and unsmiling  
跟那位極度自戀的特魯多先生  
In contrast to the extremely narcissistic Prime Minister Trudeau  
平時展現給民眾看的那種陽光帥氣  
who always presents a sunny, handsome image to the public  
笑臉明媚  
with a bright, smiling face  
與民同樂的這個風格  
and a style of engaging with the people  
形成了一個鮮明的對比  
which forms a stark contrast  
就感覺這位博勵治先生  
It feels like Mr. Poilievre  
總是拉著臉  
is always scowling  
拒人于千里之外  
and keeping people at arm's length  
給人一種不好接近的感覺  
giving the impression that he is hard to approach  
第二個大家不喜歡他的原因  
The second reason people dislike him  
就是他一直給人的印象就是批評多  
is that he has always been perceived as more critical  
質疑多 提問題是一把一把的  
questioning a lot, throwing out tons of issues  
但是似乎  
but it seems  
沒有給出讓人印象深刻的解決方案  
he hasn't provided any impressive solutions  
關於這兩個  
About these two points  
這個我點評一下  
I'll comment on this  
不過說之前我交代一下  
But before I start, let me clarify  
我個人是很欣賞他的  
Personally, I admire him  
但是咱們咱們做節目  
but when we make the program  
還是儘儘量中立  
we still try to stay neutral  
先說他這個第一點  
Let's first talk about his first point  
就是他不會作秀  
which is that he doesn't perform for show  
拒人于千里之外  
keeping people at a distance  
這點其實我覺得無無所謂  
I actually don’t think it matters  
這總理又不是交際花  
The prime minister is not supposed to be a social butterfly  
總理的任務  
The job of a prime minister  
不是讓所有的加拿大老百姓喜歡你  
is not to make every Canadian citizen like you  
像像特魯多那樣的  
Like Trudeau does  
成天耍酷  
acting cool all day  
成天上演親民秀  
putting on a show for the people every day  
跟民眾各種合影  
taking photos with the public  
把自己按照模特的標準來要求  
holding himself to model standards  
最後把加拿大搞得一團糟是吧  
and ending up making a mess of Canada  
四個字形容特魯多  
Four words to describe Trudeau  
繡花枕頭  
An ornamental pillow  
外頭好看  
Good-looking on the outside  
裡面是一個草包  
but hollow on the inside  
其實  
Actually  
加拿大需要的是一個實實在在的總理  
What Canada needs is a real, down-to-earth prime minister  
一個可以讓加拿大人民  
One who can make the Canadian people  
日子過得舒服一點的  
live a little more comfortably  
思維稍微正常一點的總理  
and have a more reasonable mindset.  
可以說博勵治不苟言笑  
It can be said that Poilievre is serious and not easily amused.  
這無所謂  
This doesn’t matter.  
關於第二點  
Regarding the second point,  
就是說他批評多  
that he criticizes a lot  
質疑多但是沒有給出解決方案  
and questions a lot but doesn't provide solutions,  
這個我覺得也很正常  
I think this is quite normal.  
因為什麼  
Why?  
因為他不是執政黨  
Because he is not in power.  
他是在野黨  
He is in the opposition.  
而在野黨  
And the role of the opposition party  
他存在的意義就是提出反對意見  
is to raise opposing views.  
這個是在野黨的主業  
This is the primary job of the opposition party.  
而給出解決方案  
And providing solutions  
是在野黨的副業中的副業  
is more of a side job for the opposition.  
因為這個也正常  
Because it's also normal.  
他不需要給  
He doesn’t need to provide them.  
因為他說了也不算  
Because what he says doesn’t count.  
他白說  
It would be in vain.  
因此說  
Therefore,  
只要他提的意見是對的  
as long as his suggestions are correct,  
只要他提的意見不是造謠中傷  
as long as they aren’t spreading falsehoods or slander,  
只要他不是胡說八道  
and as long as they aren’t nonsense,  
我覺得提意見沒問題  
I think there's no problem in making suggestions.  
一點問題都沒有  
No problem at all.  
你比方說前面說的  
For example, what was said earlier,  
他批評特魯多的毒品政策的時候  
when he criticized Trudeau's drug policy,  
說特魯多wacko  
calling Trudeau “wacko,”  
我就覺得這個詞確實不合適  
I think this term is indeed inappropriate.  
說的太輕了  
It's too light.  
還有沒有更重的詞  
Is there a stronger word?  
這個回頭我下去找找  
I’ll go and find one later.  
另外他  
Additionally, he  
他還批評特魯多這個高稅收  
also criticized Trudeau's high taxes  
和高支出的政策  
and high spending policies.  
認為這些政策  
He believes these policies  
未能有效解決民眾關切  
haven’t effectively addressed the concerns of the people,  
導致社會分裂和經濟停滯  
leading to social division and economic stagnation,  
增加了企業和家庭的負擔  
increasing the burden on businesses and families,  
對中產階級造成了很大的壓力  
and putting a lot of pressure on the middle class,  
導致收入增長停滯  
causing stagnation in income growth,  
無法對抗通脹帶來的生活成本上升  
making it impossible to fight the rising cost of living caused by inflation.  
你看 這批評的太對了  
Look, this criticism is absolutely right.  
說那你光批評沒解決方案  
They say, “You’re just criticizing, no solutions.”  
誰說沒有  
Who says there are no solutions?  
以前是不怎麼提  
It wasn’t mentioned much before,  
現在隨著最近一段時間  
but now, with the recent period  
自由黨的民調臭大街  
the Liberal Party's approval rating is plummeting,  
之後這個保守黨重新執政的概率  
the likelihood of the Conservative Party returning to power  
是前所未有的高  
is higher than ever.  
於是這位博勵治也開始走上前台  
Thus, Pierre Poilievre is starting to take the stage.  
宣揚自己的執政理念  
He is promoting his governing philosophy.  
關於這個  
Regarding this,  
我追著看了好幾期關於他的訪談  
I followed several interviews about him,  
尤其是看了那個  
especially the one  
Jordan Peterson在2025年1月2日對他的專訪  
Jordan Peterson's interview with him on January 2, 2025.  
就感覺他說的特別的好  
I felt that he spoke very well.  
基本上是各種數據  
Basically, he presented all kinds of data,  
各種證據  
various pieces of evidence,  
掰開了揉碎了給你講清楚了  
and broke it down, explaining everything clearly.  
現在加拿大所面臨的各種問題  
He explained the various issues Canada is facing today.  
而且提出了一些  
Moreover, he proposed some  
自己將來要推出的一些政策  
policies that he plans to introduce in the future.  
當然政策還談不上  
Of course, they can’t be called policies yet,  
至少是指明了一個前進的方向  
but at least he pointed out a direction for progress.  
...執政理念  
...governing philosophy.  
好 接下來咱們就重磅  
Alright, next we have something big to discuss  
咱們就簡單總結一下  
Let's briefly summarize  
博勵治以及博勵治領導下的保守黨  
Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party under his leadership  
將會推出什麼樣的一個政策  
What kind of policies they will introduce  
來讓加拿大重拾當年的榮光  
to bring Canada back to its former glory  
鐺鐺鐺鐺  
Ding ding ding  
對對 這個  
Yes, that's right, this  
先別鐺鐺  
Let's hold off on the bells for now  
說之前咱們先託付一下  
Before we continue, let me clarify  
下面  
The following  
我說的這些保守黨未來的政策總結  
is a summary of future policies by the Conservative Party  
有些是直接引用他自己說的話  
Some of it is directly from what he has said  
有些是根據他以往他的言論  
Some is based on his previous statements  
和最新的那個Jordan Peterson 2025年1月2日的採訪  
and the latest interview with Jordan Peterson on January 2, 2025  
總結出來的  
summarized from that  
還有一些  
There are also some  
就是根據保守黨以往的傳統  
based on the Conservative Party's traditions  
推測出來的  
which I’ve speculated  
這個說說清楚  
Let me make this clear  
我不保證100%正確  
I can’t guarantee it's 100% accurate  
等回頭博勵治上台之後  
When Poilievre comes into office later  
退休的某些政策  
some of the retirement policies  
跟我說的相差十萬八千里  
might be miles apart from what I’ve said  
八竿子打不著  
Completely off the mark  
雖說這個也不太可能  
Though this is unlikely  
但是還是有很小的概率  
there's still a small chance  
他不按照我說的來  
that he won’t follow what I said  
當然也對  
Of course, that's true  
他要是完全按照我說的來  
If he were to follow everything I said  
那我成了加拿大總理了  
then I’d become the Prime Minister of Canada  
哈哈 開玩笑  
Haha, just kidding  
所以說你要有一個心理準備  
So, you need to be mentally prepared  
一般來說呀  
Generally speaking  
這個在野黨上台變成執政黨  
when an opposition party comes into power  
他推行的新政策  
the new policies they implement  
也是需要一步一步來  
also need to be carried out step by step  
無論是哪個政黨執政  
No matter which party is in power  
都需要在前任政策的基礎上  
they need to adjust and improve based on the previous government's policies  
進行調整和完善  
not overturn everything immediately  
而不是一下徹底推翻  
Unlike Trump's approach  
像特朗普那樣的  
which is rare  
那樣的比較少  
It's much less common  
大部分  
Most  
都得是慢慢實行  
have to be gradually implemented  
再有一個就是博勵治  
Another thing is that Poilievre  
他必須考慮  
must consider  
他的前任給他留下的爛攤子  
the mess left by his predecessors  
對他的新政府可能造成的影響  
and the impact it might have on his new government  
這個特魯多的自由黨政府之前什麼樣  
We all know what Trudeau's Liberal government was like  
這個您清楚  
You’re clear about this  
用一句俏皮話說  
To put it in a cheeky way  
10屁股債還了9屁股  
paid off 9 of 10 butt debts  
欠一屁股債  
still owes one butt debt  
欠債的話  
If there's debt  
政府手頭就缺錢  
the government will be short of money  
再加上即將到來的特朗普的關稅大棒  
And with the looming tariff threats from Trump  
你看  
Look at  
擺在博勵治面前這麼一個爛攤子  
the mess laid out in front of Poilievre  
政治經濟社會環境都不樂觀  
The political, economic, and social environments are not looking optimistic  
那都會對下一屆政府的很多政策  
This will affect many policies of the next government  
造成影響  
and have a big impact  
所以說  
So  
我覺得應該給他時間  
I think he should be given time  
一步一步來解決  
to solve things step by step  
所以說  
So,  
今天我說的這些  
what I’m about to discuss today  
博勵治領導下的保守黨的執政理念  
are the governing philosophies of the Conservative Party under Poilievre's leadership.  
只是一個比較大的方向  
This is just a broad direction.  
即使某些政策暫時看不到落地  
Even if some policies don’t seem to be materializing for now,  
這個也不用著急  
there's no need to worry about it.  
遲早的事  
It's only a matter of time.  
OK 咱們託付完畢  
Alright, we’re done with the preliminary discussion.  
進入正題  
Let's get to the main topic.  
噹噹噹當  
Ding ding ding!  
保守黨即將推出的政策  
The policies the Conservative Party is about to introduce  
這有很多  
are numerous.  
但是總而言之  
But in summary,  
咱們要是用一句話來總結的話  
if we were to sum it up in one sentence,  
那就是博勵治自己曾經說過的  
it would be something Poilievre himself once said:  
就是回歸Common Sense  
It's about returning to Common Sense.  
這個Common Sense  
This Common Sense  
就是常識嘛  
is just common sense.  
回歸常識  
Return to common sense.  
這裡所謂的這個Common Sense  
What is meant by this Common Sense here  
說白了  
In simple terms,  
就是普通老百姓認為合理的事兒  
it's what ordinary people consider reasonable.  
換句話說  
In other words,  
就是那種符合普通人的利益  
it's about policies that align with the interests of the average person.  
能夠實際落地  
Policies that can be practically implemented,  
減少官僚干預  
reducing bureaucratic interference,  
給家庭和個人更大空間的  
giving families and individuals more space,  
可以讓老百姓得到看得見  
allowing people to see tangible benefits,  
摸得著好處的  
and touch the advantages directly.  
那些接地氣的政策  
These are down-to-earth policies.  
當然  
Of course,  
這是個大詞  
this is a broad term.  
具體來說  
Specifically,  
可以拆解為以下幾個方面  
it can be broken down into several aspects.  
咱們先說經濟政策這塊  
Let's first talk about economic policies.  
第一個重要的舉措  
The first important measure  
就是精簡政府  
is streamlining the government.  
所謂精簡政府  
What is meant by streamlining the government  
就是通過減少政府干預  
is reducing government intervention  
來促進自由市場的發展  
to promote the development of a free market.  
促進企業發展  
It's about fostering business development.  
然後這個企業有了活力  
Once businesses are more vibrant,  
就能夠創造出更多的就業機會  
they can create more job opportunities.  
就可以拉低現在非常高的失業率  
This can help reduce the currently high unemployment rate.  
第二個措施就是降低稅率  
The second measure is lowering taxes.  
他的目的  
The goal of this measure  
就是減輕加拿大人的經濟負擔  
is to alleviate the economic burden on Canadians.  
他主張給企業和個人減稅  
He advocates for tax cuts for businesses and individuals.  
以便刺激投資和消費  
This is to stimulate investment and consumption.  
從而帶動經濟增長  
Which will, in turn, drive economic growth.  
他認為在過去幾年中  
He believes that in recent years,  
加拿大政府  
the Canadian government  
在疫情期間的大規模的支出部分可以理解  
could justify the large expenditures during the pandemic,  
但是在疫情後期  
but in the post-pandemic period,  
政府並沒有及時收縮開支  
the government did not promptly cut spending,  
導致現在嚴重的通貨膨脹  
leading to severe inflation now,  
以及赤字不斷擴大  
and the continuous expansion of the deficit.  
在博勵治的設想中  
In Poilievre's vision,  
他上台之後將全面評估政府預算  
once he takes office, he will conduct a thorough evaluation of the government budget.  
削減那些不必要的行政和項目支出  
He will reduce unnecessary administrative and project expenditures.  
裁減冗員  
He will cut excess personnel.  
減員增效  
This will improve efficiency by reducing staff.  
第三個就是在環境和能源政策方面  
The third aspect concerns environmental and energy policies.  
在這個議題上  
On this issue,  
保守黨通常與自由黨  
the Conservative Party generally has clear differences with the Liberal Party  
存在著明顯的分歧  
on this matter.  
博勵治就多次質疑  
Pierre Poilievre has repeatedly questioned  
上屆自由黨政府引入的這個碳稅  
the carbon tax introduced by the previous Liberal government  
認為這個無厘頭的碳稅  
believing that this absurd carbon tax  
加重了普通家庭的生活負擔  
increased the financial burden on ordinary families  
而對這個碳稅所宣稱的  
and that the claimed environmental benefits of this carbon tax  
將會對環境帶來的保護作用  
are actually not as significant as advertised  
實際效果其實沒有那麼顯著  
and the actual effects are not so pronounced.  
博勵治就說  
Poilievre has stated  
他上台之後一定要取消碳稅  
that once he is in office, he will eliminate the carbon tax.  
不過  
However,  
取消碳稅並不代表他不重視環保  
removing the carbon tax doesn't mean he disregards environmental protection.  
他是更傾向于通過技術創新和企業研發  
He prefers to focus on reducing emissions through technological innovation and corporate research and development  
來減少排放  
to cut emissions.  
同時確保加拿大這個能源行業  
At the same time, he ensures that Canada's energy sector  
比方說石油天然氣行業  
such as the oil and natural gas industry  
能夠繼續發展  
can continue to grow.  
不會被政府用各種環保的理由  
It will not be excessively constrained by the government under the guise of environmental protection.  
給他過度的遏制  
He aims to avoid overregulation.  
另外  
Additionally,  
他也會重視對那些新能源的投資  
he will also emphasize investment in renewable energy.  
不過喜新不厭舊  
However, he advocates for the idea of embracing new without rejecting the old.  
投資新能源  
Investing in renewable energy  
並不會以犧牲傳統能源行業為代價  
will not come at the cost of traditional energy industries.  
接下來說一說他的社會政策  
Next, let's talk about his social policies.  
在社會政策這方面  
In terms of social policies,  
第一個就是傾聽普通民眾的聲音  
the first one is listening to the voices of ordinary people.  
他這個意思就是說呀  
What he means is that  
以後政府定決策  
government decisions should not be made by high-ranking officials on a whim.  
不應該由政府高官們拍腦袋來決定  
Government decisions shouldn't be made just by the elites.  
不能天上一腳地上一腳  
The government should not make decisions without considering the people's needs.  
想一出是一出  
Decisions shouldn't be random or inconsistent.  
你得傾聽民意  
You need to listen to public opinion.  
第二個舉措就是在個人自主權方面  
The second measure is in terms of personal autonomy.  
博勵治主張減少不必要的法規和限制  
Poilievre advocates for reducing unnecessary regulations and restrictions.  
以釋放個人的潛力  
to unlock the potential of individuals.  
提倡個人自主權  
He promotes personal autonomy.  
無論是在個人的經濟方面  
Whether it's in personal finance,  
家長選擇學校方面  
parents' choice of schools,  
還是在言論自由方面  
or in freedom of speech,  
以及健康和打疫苗方面  
or in health and vaccination matters,  
這種事情  
these matters,  
交給民眾自己決定  
should be left to the public to decide.  
政府最好少管  
The government should intervene as little as possible.  
你看他在那個卡車司機示威事件中  
Take his stance during the trucker protest as an example.  
他的態度  
His attitude  
就是對特魯多  
was in stark contrast to Trudeau's.  
政府要求卡車司機強制打疫苗的  
When the government mandated vaccines for truckers,  
這個態度  
his position  
他就跟特魯多是截然相反  
was completely opposite to Trudeau's.  
他是堅決反對  
He firmly opposed it.  
第三個就是強調家庭  
The third is the emphasis on family.  
博勵治認為  
Poilievre believes that  
強大的家庭是國家繁榮的基礎  
strong families are the foundation of national prosperity.  
他考慮這個政府制定政策的時候  
When making policies,  
一定要考慮對家庭的支持  
he believes the government must consider supporting families.  
尤其是在提供那個育兒支持  
Especially in providing child-rearing support,  
還有提供教育資源方面  
and in providing educational resources.  
應該時刻考慮到  
It should always consider  
為加拿大的家庭減輕負擔  
how to reduce the burdens on Canadian families.  
促進家庭健康發展  
and promote healthy family development.  
第四條就是關於如何應對高房價  
The fourth is about how to tackle high housing prices.  
您知道  
You know,  
過去幾年  
in recent years,  
加拿大各大城市的房價非常的高  
housing prices in major Canadian cities have been extremely high,  
遠遠超出了  
far exceeding  
很多普通家庭和年輕人的承受範圍  
the affordability of many ordinary families and young people.
博勵治就認為  
Poilievre believes that  
導致住房緊缺和房價居高不下  
the root cause of the housing shortage and high prices  
根源在於政府的審批程序過于繁瑣  
lies in the overly complicated government approval process  
以及某些地方政府  
and some local governments  
不願意  
are unwilling  
或者缺乏動力推進快速建房的流程  
or lack the motivation to push forward fast housing construction processes  
博勵治多次談到  
Poilievre has mentioned multiple times  
要通過削減審批流程  
the need to reduce approval processes  
為開發商與建房項目  
to provide developers and housing projects  
提供更靈活的激勵和法規  
with more flexible incentives and regulations  
讓市場可以迅速增加住房供應  
to allow the market to quickly increase housing supply  
簡而言之  
In short,  
他是希望  
he hopes  
市場能夠承擔更多的建房的責任  
that the market can take on more responsibility for building homes  
而不應該過度的依賴政府的補貼  
and should not overly rely on government subsidies  
另外  
Additionally,  
他也更加傾向于通過聯邦與省市合作  
he also leans more towards federal and provincial cooperation  
鼓勵把更多的公共土地  
encouraging the use of more public land  
用於住房建設  
for housing construction  
第五個就是毒品政策這塊  
The fifth point is drug policy  
博勵治非常反對  
Poilievre strongly opposes  
現任自由黨政府的毒品安全供應計劃  
the current Liberal government's safe drug supply program  
他聲稱這些計劃  
He claims that these programs  
導致了毒品使用  
have led to increased drug use  
和相關的死亡人數的增加  
and a rise in related deaths  
他把這些毒品程序標記為“有害程序”  
He labels these drug programs as “harmful”  
說他們正在殺人  
saying they are killing people  
對那些所謂的  
For those so-called  
在監管下的毒品消費場所  
supervised drug consumption sites  
這個也就是咱們媒體常說的毒品站  
which the media often refers to as drug stations  
毒品安全屋之類  
or safe drug houses  
博勵治對這些就表示  
Poilievre has expressed  
他打算關閉這些毒品站  
his intention to shut down these drug stations  
認為這些東西  
believing these things  
加劇了公共的安全問題  
exacerbate public safety issues  
同時他強調  
At the same time, he emphasizes  
需要增加那些  
the need to increase access for  
與毒癮正在作鬥爭的個人  
those battling addiction to receive treatment and rehabilitation services  
獲得治療和康復服務的機會  
to have access to treatment and rehabilitation services  
那那麼治療這些癮君子的錢  
As for the cost of treating these addicts  
也不需要老百姓出  
it shouldn't come from the taxpayers  
也不需要政府出  
nor should it be funded by the government  
他建議通過  
He suggests taking legal action against  
對那些被認為  
pharmaceutical companies deemed responsible  
對阿片類藥物危機負責的製藥公司  
for the opioid crisis  
這個阿片類藥物就是那個芬太尼  
These opioids refer to substances like fentanyl  
對這些公司採取法律行動  
and taking legal action against these companies  
跟他們收錢  
to hold them accountable and recover funds  
然後  
and then  
拿到錢再資助這些康復的服務  
use the funds to support rehabilitation services  
第六點  
The sixth point  
就是在如何降低犯罪率這塊  
is how to reduce the crime rate  
博勵治把犯罪率上升  
Poilievre attributes the rising crime rate  
歸因于現在自由黨政府的  
to the current Liberal government's  
過于寬大的保釋和量刑的做法  
lenient bail and sentencing policies  
過分的保證了罪犯的人權  
which excessively protect the human rights of criminals  
也就是所謂的抓了就放的  
known as the "catch and release" approach  
這個做法  
This practice  
讓犯罪分子們是有恃無恐  
leaves criminals unafraid of punishment  
得不到任何應有的懲罰  
and they don’t receive the punishment they deserve  
這才導致了現在社會  
This has led to the current situation in society  
犯罪率居高不下的嚴重狀況  
where the crime rate remains dangerously high  
博勵治就提議  
Poilievre proposed  
實施那種針對慣犯的三次打擊法  
implementing a three-strikes law for repeat offenders  
事不過三  
Three strikes, you're out  
第三次你就別想舒服  
After the third offense, no comfort  
目的就是  
The goal is  
對那些多次犯下嚴重罪行的人  
to impose harsher penalties on those who commit serious crimes repeatedly  
實施更嚴厲的懲罰  
and ensure stricter punishments.  
而且  
And also  
設立這種對暴力犯罪和性犯罪的  
Establishing mandatory minimum sentences for violent and sexual crimes  
強制性的最低刑罰  
A mandatory minimum sentence  
目的就是威懾那些嚴重的犯罪活動  
The goal is to deter serious criminal activities  
好 這個是社會政策  
Okay, this is the social policy  
接下來咱們再說一說他的教育政策  
Next, let's talk about his education policy  
這個可能屏幕前有很多的留學生  
There may be many international students watching this  
還有很多家長  
And many parents as well  
很關心這個話題  
Who are very concerned about this topic  
在教育這塊  
On the topic of education  
第一個  
The first point is  
博勵治強調家庭在教育中的核心地位  
Poilievre emphasizes the central role of family in education  
他認為家庭是孩子教育的第一責任人  
He believes that the family is the primary responsible party for children's education  
主張家長應該擁有更多的選擇學校的權利  
He advocates that parents should have more rights to choose schools  
應該根據孩子的需求和興趣  
Parents should be able to choose schools based on their child's needs and interests  
選擇適合自己孩子的學校和教育方式  
To select the appropriate school and educational methods for their child  
而不是由別人說了算  
Rather than being dictated by others  
第二  
The second point  
他提倡在教育體系中引入競爭機制  
He advocates introducing competition mechanisms into the education system  
競爭能夠激發學校的創新和改進  
Competition can stimulate innovation and improvement in schools  
提升整體的教育水平  
Improving the overall level of education  
第三個觀點就是  
The third point is  
博勵治支持教育內容的多樣化  
Poilievre supports the diversification of educational content  
認為應該尊重不同的文化和價值觀  
He believes that different cultures and values should be respected  
促進學生的全面理解和包容  
Fostering comprehensive understanding and inclusivity among students  
另外他也強調  
Additionally, he emphasizes  
教育應該培養學生的批判性思維  
Education should cultivate students' critical thinking  
和獨立判斷能力  
And their ability to make independent judgments  
幫助他們成為有責任感的公民  
Helping them become responsible citizens  
第四個是關於大學教育這塊  
The fourth point is about university education  
博勵治承諾要保護大學的言論自由  
Poilievre promises to protect freedom of speech in universities  
他建議任命一名退休法官  
He suggests appointing a retired judge  
作為言論自由的衛士  
As a guardian of free speech  
來監督和調查學術審查的投訴  
To oversee and investigate complaints regarding academic censorship  
並且有權建議  
And has the authority to recommend  
減少對不合規大學的聯邦資助  
Reducing federal funding to non-compliant universities  
第五條就是關於省級學校  
The fifth point is about provincial schools  
在性別認同方面的政策  
Policies regarding gender identity  
當然這個你也知道  
Of course, you know  
因為教育不是聯邦政府負責的  
Because education is not under federal jurisdiction  
是省政府管的  
It is managed by the provincial governments  
因此說博勵治只能是提建議  
Therefore, Poilievre can only make suggestions  
不過他強調了一個原則  
However, he emphasizes one principle  
有關此類關於性別這個問題的決定  
Decisions on such gender-related issues  
應該由各省政府和家長共同負責  
Should be jointly responsible by provincial governments and parents  
而不能把家長的意見排除在外  
And parents' opinions should not be excluded  
接下來再說一說  
Next, let's talk about  
大家都比較關心的移民政策問題  
The immigration policy issue that everyone is concerned about  
這個我相信屏幕前有很多移民朋友  
I believe there are many immigrant friends watching this  
會有一些擔心  
Who might be worried  
因為這個傳統的保守黨  
Because the traditional Conservative Party  
他們的某些成員在歷史上有段時期  
Some of their members have historically had a period of  
對多元文化的立場是偏保守的  
A conservative stance on multiculturalism  
對新移民的語言  
On new immigrants' language  
文化融入要求  
And their cultural integration requirements  
都比較高  
Have been relatively high  
就可能會有人擔心  
So some may be worried  
這個博勵治上台之後  
That Poilievre's rise to power  
會不會對這個加拿大的移民政策  
Will cause Canada's immigration policy  
整體右傾  
To shift to the right  
對移民不好？  
And be bad for immigrants?  
這個我覺得您大可放心  
I think you can rest assured about this  
據我觀察  
From what I have observed  
博勵治本人在公開場合  
Poilievre himself has not been  
談到移民的話題時候  
As extreme in his rhetoric on immigration in public  
並沒有像某些極有政治人物那樣  
As some highly political figures have been  
激烈的排外  
Aggressively xenophobic
他不說這種話  
He doesn't say things like that  
這個咱不說別的  
Let's not talk about anything else here  
就說一件事  
Let's just talk about one thing  
他跟特魯多那樣的官二代不一樣  
He's different from the second-generation political elite like Trudeau  
他其實從小成長於普通家庭  
He actually grew up in an ordinary family  
受的是普通的加拿大式的正統教育  
He received a typical Canadian education  
而加拿大  
And Canada  
作為一個移民國家  
As an immigrant nation  
對新移民和留學生的依賴程度  
Relies heavily on immigrants and international students  
非常的高  
It's extremely high  
博勵治從小身邊看到的  
What Poilievre saw growing up  
聽到的都是那些普通移民的生活  
And heard were the lives of ordinary immigrants  
再加上他身兼法裔和英裔兩種文化  
In addition, he has both French and English cultural backgrounds  
他的三觀是不可能走極端路線反移民的  
His worldview cannot possibly take an extreme anti-immigrant stance  
而且你看他太太  
And also, if you look at his wife  
他太太實際上也是移民來的  
His wife is also an immigrant  
他太太是委內瑞拉移民  
His wife is a Venezuelan immigrant  
名字叫做Anaida Galindo  
Her name is Anaida Galindo  
她是1987年3月5日出生於委內瑞拉的Caracas  
She was born on March 5, 1987, in Caracas, Venezuela  
她的父親  
Her father  
曾經是委內瑞拉的一個銀行經理  
Was once a bank manager in Venezuela  
這個小姑娘是在8歲的時候  
This young girl moved to Canada at the age of 8  
跟她的家人移民到加拿大  
She immigrated with her family to Canada  
定居在魁北克的蒙特利爾  
They settled in Montreal, Quebec  
等這個Anaida上班  
After Anaida started working  
之後  
She later  
她是在加拿大的參議院和眾議院  
Worked as a parliamentary affairs advisor in the Canadian Senate and House of Commons  
擔任議會事務顧問  
Serving as an advisor on parliamentary affairs  
於是後來就因為工作關係  
Later, due to work connections  
認識了博勵治  
She met Poilievre  
後來兩個人是在2017年的12月結婚  
They later got married in December 2017  
有兩個孩子  
They have two children  
大的是女兒  
The older one is a daughter  
小的是兒子  
The younger one is a son  
因此據我分析  
So, based on my analysis  
這個博勵治對待移民的態度  
Poilievre's attitude toward immigration  
他就是一個非常正常的態度  
Is a very normal one  
他不會反移民的  
He is not anti-immigrant  
他更多的  
He focuses more on  
還是著眼于經濟與財政的問題  
Economic and fiscal issues  
只要留學生和新移民  
As long as international students and new immigrants  
能夠展現自我價值  
Can demonstrate their value  
他都會加以支持  
He will support them  
這個咱們也不是亂說  
We're not just saying this without reason  
咱們可以通過分析他的言論  
We can see this by analyzing his statements  
可以看出來  
It's clear  
他對移民政策強調的是  
He emphasizes that immigration policy should be  
合法 有序 高質量  
Legal, orderly, and high-quality  
就是他得平衡這兩者之間的關係  
He needs to balance these two aspects  
既要讓這個保守派的基本盤滿意  
Satisfying the conservative base  
保持對外來人員的  
While maintaining control over outsiders  
這個管控和篩選意識  
And screening awareness  
又不能忽視加拿大隊外國人才勞動力  
He can't ignore the demand for foreign labor in Canada  
以及外國留學生的極大的需求  
And the huge demand for international students  
所以說這兩者得平衡  
So, these two aspects need to be balanced  
當然這裡面說的管控和篩選  
Of course, when we talk about control and screening  
不是說要限制移民數量那麼簡單  
It's not just about restricting the number of immigrants  
而是說不要流入過多的那種  
It means avoiding an influx of people who  
除了吃福利  
Are only here to consume welfare  
對加拿大人來說沒有任何貢獻的那種  
And contribute nothing to Canadians  
純拖加拿大後腿的  
Purely dragging Canada down  
那那那種 說白了就是難民了  
Those, to put it bluntly, are refugees  
難民可以有  
There can be refugees  
但是不要太多  
But not too many  
而且應該適度的引導社會  
And society should be properly guided  
把焦點放在  
To focus on  
如何更好的吸收和利用新移民的技能  
How to better absorb and utilize the skills  
和資源上面  
And resources of new immigrants  
而不是一味限制移民數量  
Rather than just restricting the number of immigrants  
這就是他所謂的這個管控的意思  
This is what he means by control  
不過總體上來說  
Overall, however,  
他還是傾向于減少難民  
he is still inclined to reduce the intake of refugees  
和臨時居民的接收  
and temporary residents.  
以符合加拿大的住房  
to align with Canada's housing  
和醫療的保健能力  
and healthcare capacity.  
他建議把這個移民的吸收量  
He suggests linking immigration intake  
和這個住房的供應量掛鉤起來  
with the supply of housing.  
他多次明確表示  
He has repeatedly stated  
目前的接收移民的力度  
that the current level of immigration intake  
嚴重超出了  
severely exceeds  
加拿大可以容納新移民的能力  
Canada's capacity to accommodate new immigrants.  
所以說你看  
So, as you can see,  
他這個思維是很正常的  
his thinking is quite reasonable.  
因此說他執政之後  
Therefore, after taking office,  
對移民來說  
immigrants can expect  
大概率會推出以下這些具體的措施  
that he is likely to implement the following measures.  
第一個  
The first one  
就是關於技術移民和快速通道這塊  
is related to skilled immigration and the Express Entry program.  
博勵治多次表示  
Poilievre has repeatedly expressed  
對一些走後門  
strong dissatisfaction with cases of backdoor access  
或者是這個快速通道被濫用的情況  
or misuse of the Express Entry system.  
表示強烈的不滿  
He has strongly criticized it.  
他認為必須要整頓和規範  
He believes there must be an overhaul and regulation  
引入一個更加嚴格的  
introducing a stricter  
技術移民的評分體系  
skilled immigration points system.  
更透明與快速的審核流程  
A more transparent and faster review process.  
確保真正符合加拿大經濟需要的人  
To ensure that people who truly meet Canada's economic needs  
能夠迅速獲批  
can be quickly approved.  
目前加拿大的經濟  
Currently, Canada's economy  
仍然需要大量的工程師的  
still requires a large number of engineers,  
IT人員的  
IT professionals,  
醫療人員  
healthcare workers,  
護理人員等等  
nurses, and so on.  
保守黨一直認為  
The Conservative Party has always believed  
只有高技能的移民  
that only high-skilled immigrants  
才能夠直接促進加拿大的經濟發展  
can directly contribute to Canada's economic development.  
因此說  
Therefore,  
保守黨可能會為此類申請者  
the Conservative Party may offer these applicants  
提供更加透明  
a more transparent  
更加高效的審批流程  
and efficient approval process.  
當然對那些低技能  
Of course, for those with low skills  
或者是因為家庭原因申請團聚移民的  
or those applying for family reunification due to personal reasons,  
這個申請人  
their applications  
他也不會說是把門給關死  
won't be completely shut out,  
只不過審核會更加的嚴格  
but the review process will be stricter.  
減少被濫用的可能性  
to reduce the possibility of abuse.  
第二個  
The second one  
就是關於這個留學機構  
concerns the regulation of educational institutions  
和這個院校資質的監管  
and the accreditation of schools.  
就是針對留學生這塊  
Regarding international students,  
他的看法也是開放和謹慎並舉  
his approach is one of openness, with caution.  
一方面  
On one hand,  
他也承認  
he also acknowledges  
留學生對加拿大的經濟  
the contribution of international students to Canada's economy  
和校園文化的多元化的貢獻  
and the diversification of campus culture.  
另一方面  
On the other hand,  
他認為政府不應該為了那個學費經濟  
he believes the government should not prioritize tuition revenue  
而無限制的放開留學通道  
by loosening the international student pathways indefinitely.  
你看在自由黨時代  
Look at the Liberal era,  
有不少私立院校  
many private schools  
或者是些不知名的野鷄大學  
or lesser-known "fly-by-night" universities  
被質疑質量不過關  
have been criticized for poor quality,  
卻能夠招來大批的國際學生  
yet they still manage to attract a large number of international students,  
以賺取高額的學費  
to profit from high tuition fees.  
博勵治就特別恨這種  
Poilievre particularly despises this  
多次表達自己的反對態度  
and has repeatedly expressed his opposition to it.  
因此說這個博勵治在這方面  
Therefore, Pierre Poilievre may strengthen regulations in this area
可能會加強監管  
and may increase oversight
要求院校定期向聯邦移民部  
requiring institutions to report regularly to the federal immigration department
報告學生的就讀情況  
on the enrollment status of students
並且對那些不達標的院校進行整頓  
and take action to rectify institutions that do not meet standards
或者是直接取消招生資格  
or even revoke their recruitment eligibility
他反正是希望  
His goal, after all, is
留學政策能夠給高校帶來收入的同時  
that international student policies can bring revenue to universities
也要確保加拿大社會的整體負擔可控  
while ensuring that the overall burden on Canadian society remains manageable
不至於引發住房  
without exacerbating housing
就業資源的這些更加嚴重的緊缺  
and employment resource shortages
總體來說  
Overall,
對於那些真正的  
for those who truly
想要靠自己的努力和刻苦的學習  
wish to achieve a high level of education in Canada through hard work and dedication
拿到加拿大的高學歷的  
these students will benefit from
這些學生們來說  
an increasingly regulated educational environment
這個整體的就讀環境  
which will be more standardized in the future
以後將更加的規範  
and more regulated.
第三點就是關於學生就業這塊  
The third point concerns student employment
因為博勵治非常重視  
because Poilievre places great emphasis on
加拿大的學校教育  
the alignment of Canada's educational system
和加拿大的勞動力市場的實際需求  
with the actual needs of the Canadian labor market
這兩方面的這個配合  
and the coordination of these two aspects
因此媒體分析  
Therefore, media analysis suggests
他可能會鼓勵留學生  
he may encourage international students
在加拿大完成學業之後  
to stay in Canada after graduation
留在本地工作並且定居  
work locally and settle down
但是同樣  
However, at the same time
也是需要做到兩個平衡  
it will require a balance of two factors
一方面  
On one hand,
需要維持加拿大對國際學生的吸引力  
Canada needs to maintain its attractiveness to international students
另一方面  
On the other hand,
也要確保留學生的規模  
it must also ensure that the scale of international students
不會過度的膨脹  
does not expand excessively
而擠占本地學生的就業空間  
and crowd out job opportunities for local students
也是一個二者平衡  
This balance is crucial
還有人分析  
Others speculate
或許他會推動某些省份和地區  
that he may push certain provinces and regions
與聯邦進行合作  
to collaborate with the federal government
鼓勵留學生畢業之後  
to encourage international students to work in
從事那些比較缺勞動力的行業  
sectors with labor shortages after graduation
或者是去一些偏遠的地區  
or to work in remote areas
就業並且定居  
and settle down
從而平衡加拿大的  
in order to balance Canada's
人口與經濟發展的區域差異  
regional disparities in population and economic development
也許會推出一些相應的優惠政策  
Perhaps he will introduce corresponding incentive policies
比方說你要是去偏遠地區的話  
For instance, if you go to a remote area
這個審批就會快一點  
the approval process will be faster
或者給你提供一些額外的激勵措施之類的  
or offer you additional incentives
當然  
Of course,
以上我說的這幾條  
the points I just mentioned
都是“可能”  
are all "possibilities"
博勵治本人畢竟現在還沒當選  
Poilievre has not yet been elected, after all
現在說什麼都還是太早  
It is still too early to make predictions
最後一個  
The final point
就是說一下  
is to mention
他關於國家主權方面的政策  
his policies regarding national sovereignty
首先第一個就是大家最關心的  
The first, and perhaps most concerning,
就是那個大嘴巴特朗普所說的  
is the statement made by the loudmouth Trump
加拿大應該成為美國的第51個州  
that Canada should become the 51st state of the United States
這個上集節目我說過了  
I mentioned this in the previous episode
博勵治他明確表示  
Poilievre has made it clear
加拿大永遠不會成為美國的第51個州  
that Canada will never become the 51st state of the United States
加拿大是一個偉大而獨立的國家  
Canada is a great and independent country
他就是強調  
He emphasizes that
加拿大  
Canada
應該抵禦外部勢力對國家政策的干預  
should resist foreign interference in its national policies
維護國家的獨立性和自主性  
and maintain its independence and autonomy
主張加強加拿大的邊境和軍隊  
and advocates for strengthening Canada's borders and military
另外在國際事務中  
In addition, in international affairs  
加拿大應該根據自身的利益和價值觀  
Canada should act based on its own interests and values  
採取獨立自主的立場  
Adopt an independent stance  
保護國家利益  
Protect national interests  
不知道大家看了我前面說的這些  
I wonder how everyone feels after hearing what I said earlier  
這個政策那個政策的什麼感覺  
About this policy and that policy  
反正我說的是挺開心的  
Anyway, I felt quite happy saying it  
也挺興奮的  
And quite excited as well  
這個不對  
Wait, that's not right  
我還是作為媒體  
I still need to maintain neutrality as a media outlet  
我還是...雖然是自媒體  
I mean... even though I am self-media  
我還是得儘量保持中立  
I still have to strive to stay neutral  
這個我總結一下吧  
Let me summarize this  
前面我提到的這些  
These things I mentioned earlier  
政策大方向  
The general direction of the policies  
有很多的亮點  
There are many highlights  
但是這裡面有很多的問題  
But there are also many issues within them  
咱們就先說問題  
Let's start with the issues  
我個人看來  
In my personal opinion  
博勵治的政策  
Poilievre's policies  
有一定的理想主義成分在裡面  
Have some elements of idealism in them  
你看在這個政治舞台上  
You see, on this political stage  
他不是簡單的你  
It's not as simple as you  
你所謂的一個Common Sense  
Your so-called "Common Sense"  
一個單詞  
Just a single word  
就能夠  
Can convince  
就可以說服所有的反對力量來支持你的  
All opposition forces to support you  
這個咱們舉一個最簡單的例子  
Let's take a very simple example  
博勵治的Common Sense  
Poilievre's Common Sense  
跟特朗普心中的Common Sense 那能一樣嗎  
Can it be the same as Trump's Common Sense?  
還有跟這個特魯多心目中的Common Sense  
And how about Trudeau's Common Sense?  
那個能一樣嗎  
Can that be the same?  
你看特魯多就覺得吸毒者呀  
You see, Trudeau believes drug users  
流浪者那都是弱勢群體  
And the homeless are vulnerable groups  
那政府應該大力保護  
And the government should strongly protect them  
你看特魯多的這種Common Sense  
This is Trudeau's Common Sense  
所以說...  
So...  
所謂Common Sense這個詞  
The term "Common Sense"  
其實就只是一個宣傳口號  
Is actually just a propaganda slogan  
最後還是會陷入自說自話的一個怪圈  
In the end, it will fall into a vicious circle of talking to oneself  
另外 咱們以這個移民為例  
Another example is immigration  
雖說  
Although  
博勵治主張高質量有序的移民  
Poilievre advocates for high-quality, orderly immigration  
可是  
However,  
現在加拿大面對的是全球化競爭  
Canada is now facing global competition  
你也需要加大力度  
You also need to step up efforts  
去爭奪那些頂尖人才  
To compete for top talent  
依靠新移民  
Rely on new immigrants  
來支撐勞動力市場和人口的增長  
To support the labor market and population growth  
如果你過于嚴格的篩選  
If you are too strict in screening  
可能會錯失大量高潛力的移民  
You might miss out on a large number of high-potential immigrants  
但是反過來  
But conversely,  
如果放的太鬆的話  
If it's too lax  
又會引發對社會和資源分配的  
It could raise concerns about social and resource allocation  
這個擔憂  
This concern  
所以說能否拿捏好這個平衡  
So, whether this balance can be struck  
還是需要一個十分細緻的政策設計  
Requires a very detailed policy design  
另外再比如說的這個貿易和外交  
Another example is trade and diplomacy  
你看  
You see,  
保守黨歷來強調與美國的友好合作  
The Conservative Party has always emphasized friendly cooperation with the United States  
於是很多人就覺得  
So many people think  
博勵治這次對特朗普  
Poilievre will just follow whatever Trump says this time  
是不是也都是特朗普說什麼就給什麼  
Isn’t it the case that he will just give Trump whatever he asks for?  
這個怎麼說  
What can be said about this?  
平時對美國言聽計從 可以  
Normally, listening to the U.S. might be fine  
但是在現在  
But now,  
這種美國的自我保護主義抬頭  
With the rise of American protectionism  
對加拿大開始徵收高額關稅  
Imposing high tariffs on Canada  
對加拿大的資源  
On Canada's resources  
或者產品進行限制的時候  
Or restricting Canadian products  
作為加拿大總理  
As the Prime Minister of Canada  
應該如何維護加拿大的自身利益  
How should you safeguard Canada's own interests?  
具體應該怎麼做  
What should be done specifically?  
好像沒有聽他說  
It seems like we haven’t heard him speak on this.  
另外  
Additionally  
我看他在那個接受採訪的時候提到了  
I saw that he mentioned during the interview  
“天然氣的價格“  
"The price of natural gas"  
“在歐洲和亞洲的價格是北美的3到5倍”  
"Prices in Europe and Asia are 3 to 5 times higher than in North America"  
“這意味著”  
"This means"  
“如果加拿大能夠把產品運到那邊的話”  
"If Canada can transport products there"  
“那能夠獲得巨額的利潤”  
"That would generate huge profits"  
當然 他只說了一嘴  
Of course, he just mentioned it briefly  
因此說大家就推測  
So people speculate  
他應該會加強  
He will likely strengthen  
加拿大與歐洲和亞洲的貿易關係  
Canada's trade relations with Europe and Asia  
不過  
However,  
至於他的具體的外交政策框架  
As for his specific foreign policy framework  
現在他尚未完全闡明  
He has not fully explained it yet  
當然前面我只是舉了兩個例子  
Of course, I have only given two examples so far  
而加拿大當前所面臨的挑戰  
The challenges Canada currently faces  
遠遠不止什麼移民  
Are far beyond just immigration  
外貿 外交  
Foreign trade, diplomacy  
還包括什麼通脹  
It also includes inflation  
房價呀 公共債務  
Housing prices, public debt  
疫情後遺症  
The aftermath of the pandemic  
全球局勢動盪  
Global instability  
人口老齡化呀  
Aging population  
氣候變暖  
Climate change  
所以說博勵治的這個回歸Common Sense  
So, Pierre Poilievre's return to "Common Sense"  
這個主張  
This advocacy  
雖說是簡單直接  
Although it is simple and direct  
但是在複雜的國際環境下  
In the complex international environment  
他的政策難免受到外部的約束  
His policies are inevitably constrained by external factors  
還有  
Also,  
現在加拿大這個多元的社會經濟結構  
Canada's current diverse socio-economic structure  
區域的利益衝突  
Regional conflicts of interest  
和這個意識形態的分歧  
And ideological differences  
以及加拿大現在這個議會制  
And Canada's current parliamentary system  
決定了他必須在黨派博弈中尋求妥協  
It means he must seek compromises in party politics  
如果  
If  
他以後要是不幸組建了一個少數政府  
If he unfortunately forms a minority government in the future  
他還得需要爭取魁人黨團  
He will still need to gain support from the Bloc Québécois  
或者是新民黨NDP  
Or the New Democratic Party (NDP)  
或者 甚至是他的對手自由黨的支持  
Or even support from his opponent, the Liberal Party  
所以說這個政治現實的複雜性  
So the complexity of political reality  
可能會削弱他所謂的Common Sense  
May weaken his so-called "Common Sense"  
這個直接性  
This directness  
就使得他這個改革的過程充滿挑戰  
Making his reform process full of challenges  
好 前面就是我總結的他  
Alright, what I summarized earlier  
他闡明自己的執政理念時候  
When he clarified his governance philosophy  
我看到裡面的一些問題  
I noticed some issues within it  
當然我我這個不是批評  
Of course, this is not criticism  
而是我對他執政前景的一個擔心  
But a concern about his future governance  
就是提出來大家可以思考  
I raise this for everyone to think about  
當然除了我自己說的這些問題之外  
Of course, aside from the issues I've mentioned  
我觀察咱們華人社區對博勵治的態度  
I have observed that the Chinese community's attitude toward Poilievre  
目前大多數還是肯定多於反對  
Currently, the majority are more supportive than opposed  
都比較支持他  
Most people support him  
很多人期待  
Many people expect  
他能夠對現在的加拿大社會的高房價  
He will reform the high housing prices in Canadian society  
高通貨膨脹的進行一個改革  
And address high inflation  
對自由黨亂花錢的這個做法加以糾正  
And correct the Liberal Party's reckless spending  
也同時  
At the same time  
也很欣賞博勵治這位  
They also appreciate Poilievre's  
這位  
This  
這個小夥子的幹練和說人話的風格  
Young man's competence and straightforward style  
另外也非常認同他這個小政府  
They also strongly agree with his small government approach  
和對個人奮鬥這個精神的倡導  
And his advocacy for individual effort
但是也有另外一些人擔憂  
But there are also other concerns  
就是說  
That is to say,  
保守黨傳統上對社會福利的收縮  
The Conservative Party's traditional reduction of social welfare  
可能會影響到新移民的公共服務  
Might affect public services for new immigrants  
或者是補貼  
Or subsidies  
還有就是  
And also,  
在針對留學生和移民資質的審核層面  
On the aspect of reviewing the qualifications of international students and immigrants  
是不是也有可能會更加嚴格  
Is it also possible that it will become stricter?  
會導致一些人群陷入不利的境地  
This might put some groups in a disadvantaged position  
這樣  
That's how it is  
但是說一千道一萬  
But to say a thousand words,  
我個人對他還是比較有信心的  
Personally, I still have a lot of confidence in him  
這裡面有三個理由  
There are three reasons for this  
第一個就是我感覺博勵治這個人  
The first reason is that I feel Pierre Poilievre  
看問題比較能夠切中要害  
Has a good sense of hitting the nail on the head  
感覺他  
He seems to  
在與普通大眾打交道的時候  
When interacting with the general public  
他的語言更加接地氣  
His language is more down-to-earth  
說人話能夠切中要害的  
He speaks in a way that resonates with people and addresses key issues  
指出很多大眾心目中的問題  
Pointing out many issues that are on the minds of the public  
對那些在生活成本上面苦苦掙扎  
For those struggling with the cost of living  
對政府官僚化  
And those dissatisfied with bureaucratization in government  
心存不滿的加拿大人來說  
It seems he provides a remedy  
他似乎就提供了一種良藥  
He seems to offer a cure  
減少稅收  
Reducing taxes  
減少管制  
Reducing regulations  
重視個人奮鬥  
Emphasizing personal effort  
這樣的思路  
Such an approach  
在短期內確實能夠激發社會活力  
In the short term, this can certainly stimulate social vitality  
我看好他的第二個理由  
The second reason I’m optimistic about him  
就是他的政治經驗非常的豐富  
Is that he has very rich political experience  
剛才咱們前面說了  
As we mentioned earlier  
他的個人履歷  
His personal history  
體現了  
Reflects  
他對加拿大多元文化的深刻理解  
His profound understanding of Canada's multiculturalism  
並且他有20多年  
And he has more than 20 years  
27年左右的在政治領域的服務經歷  
Around 27 years of service in the political field  
所以說他的成長經歷  
So his personal growth experience  
以及他的教育背景  
And his educational background  
為他在政治舞台上的成功  
Have laid a solid foundation for his success on the political stage  
奠定了堅實的基礎  
Providing a strong foundation  
最後一個我看好他的理由  
The final reason I’m optimistic about him  
就是他的性格  
Is his character  
他有一種那種  
He has this kind of  
怎麼說 毫不退縮  
How should I put it, he's unwavering  
迎難而上  
And faces challenges head-on  
勇敢戰鬥的精神  
With a courageous spirit  
而且特別能說呀  
And he's particularly good at speaking  
句句說到點子上  
Every word he says hits the point  
儘管在競選的時候所說的話  
Although some of what he said during the campaign  
和最後他上台以後執政的實踐之間  
Might differ from the actual implementation after he takes office  
往往存在差異  
There is often a discrepancy  
不過我相信  
But I believe  
只要博勵治能夠繼續發揚他的優點  
As long as Poilievre continues to promote his strengths  
應該能夠平衡種種壓力  
He should be able to balance various pressures  
兌現他對大眾做出的Common Sense的承諾  
And fulfill his commitment to the public for common sense  
所許諾的種種好處  
The various benefits he promised  
帶領加拿大民眾  
Lead the people of Canada  
實現15年前哈珀時代的榮光  
And bring back the glory of Harper's era 15 years ago  
讓我們拭目以待  
Let's wait and see  
好 今天時間到了  
Alright, time's up for today  
咱們就說到這  
That's all for today
