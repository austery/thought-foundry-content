I am billed as the world's
greatest mind reader.
But guess what?
I can't read minds.
What I can do is read people.
And people ask a question all the time,
which is, “Were you born with this?”
And the answer is no, of course not.
Absolutely not.
I do not possess any supernatural powers.
I am not a psychic.
This is a learnable skill
that I feel anyone could do,
but I've applied
for about roughly three decades
at reverse-engineering the human mind.
If I know how you think,
I know what you think.
And I want to ask each and every one
of you in this room a question.
But before we do, take a deep breath in.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale out and close your eyes.
A little zen mode, OK.
I see the people with trust issues,
eyes wide open,
holding their wallets and phones.
Fellow New Yorkers.
(Laughter)
Here is my question.
If you could have dinner,
hypothetical, with someone famous, right?
Some of you have heard
this question already,
I didn't invent it, I love asking people,
someone famous,
dead or alive, past or present,
man, woman, whatever.
I like to ask people,
who would that person be for you?
It’s fascinating, everyone’s different,
and if you've already
done it, open your eyes.
Some of you have done it,
some of you are quick,
I see nods, I see people
that are decisive.
If you haven't, you always
need a deadline for creativity.
Three, two, one, crunch time,
open your eyes.
Everyone out there,
give me a big clap over your head
if you can see your person
in your mind's eye, give me a big clap.
(Claps)
One more big clap.
Notice the technique.
Elbows locked on this man.
Michael Phelps would have been jealous
of that streamline.
Stand up, please.
Introduce yourself.
Person: I'm Ian.
OP: Ian, question for you.
Before you walked
in this room and sat down,
did you have any idea who I was
or what I was going to do?
Ian: No, actually, sorry.
OP: OK, that's cool,
nobody reads the agenda.
Totally fine.
Give me another clap.
I like that, right here,
you not only clap,
but threw in a little belly dance.
I reward extra credit.
She's hiding her name tag.
She's like, "I'm giving
the mentalist nothing."
What is your name?
Person: Oh, hi, I'm Nanjera.
OP: Nanjera? Stand up please.
Did I say that correctly, Nanjera?
Wonderful.
Give me another clap.
One more clap.
This man and I just locked eyes.
When we made eye contact,
he closed his eyes tightly.
(Laughter)
As if activating a camouflage shield
where if he doesn't see me,
would I still see him?
I still see you, Jeff Johnson,
stand up, please.
Give all three helpers
a round of applause.
(Applause)
Notice the question
and the way it was phrased.
Dead or alive?
Fifty-fifty, like flipping a coin.
All three of you, please.
I don't read minds,
I'm telling you the truth.
I read people.
Try not to react.
If the person you thought of is alive,
then their heart is beating
in their chest,
the room is getting warm,
like the blood flowing
through their veins,
they're happy, smiling,
alive, warming up.
Cold? You feel a shiver down your neck.
Clear cut, 100 percent,
Jeff Johnson, your person
is alive and well, am I right?
JJ: You're right.
OP: The boisterous smile,
the effervescence, 100 percent,
versus Ian, dead guy vibes
written all over this guy.
Is it a dead guy?
Ian: Yeah.
OP: Classic Ian, classic.
(Laughter)
Ian, focus on this --
Also, the lingering hands in pockets,
always indicator of another guy.
Guy-to-guy interaction. Is it a guy?
Ian: Yes.
OP: Of course it is.
If it's a female, hands in front
of the crotch, I don't know why.
(Laughter)
A few of you are going to get home,
and you see your husband like this,
and you're like, "Who is she?"
(Laughter)
Ian, think of his first name,
think of his last name.
First name, last name.
Come back to me.
The first name, try to count the letters.
This doesn't make sense.
Listen to me.
This doesn't make sense.
He was confused when I asked
about the last name.
He tried to shield it, but I saw it.
Why was he confused?
Then I asked the first name,
count the letters.
It was too long.
Sit down if it's Alexander the Great.
Ian: What?
(Laughter and scattered applause)
You don't have to hold
the applause inside, TED.
You can let it out.
(Applause and cheers)
You've seen a taste of what I do.
And this is used primarily
for the purpose of entertainment.
But what I'd like to show you now
is how you could apply
the principles of my craft,
which is known as mentalism,
to your everyday lives.
At home, at work, in your relationships.
How would guessing a celebrity
out of a stranger's mind help you?
Well, frankly, it really can't.
(Laughter)
But I have a situation,
a scenario where knowing someone's name
would be incredibly valuable.
Let me paint a portrait.
You're at a party, you're at a work event,
you've walked up to somebody new,
you've looked them in the eye,
shaken their hands,
introduced yourselves to each other,
and right at that moment,
you realize that you have completely
forgotten the person's name
who just told it to you one second ago.
Raise your hand if you can share
this experience.
You raise your hand, too, you liar.
She's like, "Not me, not me."
I want to give you a superpower,
from this day forward,
where you will never, ever
forget the name of someone you just met.
Ever.
And how am I going to do this?
Using, can you guess?
Shampoo.
Didn't see that one coming, did you?
The back of every bottle of shampoo
is a masterclass in brilliant marketing.
Three words in the instructions:
lather, rinse, repeat.
Lather, makes your hair smell good;
rinse makes it clean;
repeat -- we've got to sell some product.
I want to repurpose that catchphrase
that each and every one
of you will remember
and take with you
for the rest of your days.
Listen. Repeat. Reply.
Say it with me, listen, repeat, reply.
Listen sounds like the most
obvious thing in the world.
Of course, listen to the name.
But that's where most of you falter.
At the moment the person
tells you the name,
you are actually not listening.
You are thinking about what
you're going to say back.
Do I know this person
or what am I going to say next?
Or a million other thoughts
that pop into your head.
It's not a memory issue.
You didn't forget the name,
you never knew it.
Imagine I give you a twig
and I tell you, write my name
in the sand at the beach.
And you try with the twig.
First wave washes it away.
But if I give you a thick branch,
you carve it in.
You repeat those letters.
It's going to take a whole lot
of waves until there's no trace.
So here's what each
of you is going to do.
When you meet the next person,
make your mind a blank
for all of two seconds.
When they say their name, truly listen.
And now repeat.
Everybody say it with me, repeat.
We are going to say their name
twice back to them, right?
Ashley, is that right?
Great to meet you Ashley.
This serves two purposes.
One, it kind of repetitively
ingrains it in our memory.
Second, you know how
to pronounce it correctly.
Nanjera? Am I saying that right, Nanjera?
See, there was a reason I did that.
Third, third: reply.
Listen, repeat?
Reply.
Reply is where we fully
cement the name in.
Here is how we do that,
I'll give you three examples.
First one, a compliment.
Everyone loves a good compliment, right?
"Ashley, those earrings,
I love those earrings, Ashley."
Now she's Ashley with the earrings.
A visual indicator.
Next up, spelling.
"Do you spell that Ashley
with an EIGH or with an EY?
EY, of course, that's the right
spelling, Ashley, I knew."
Or, third, a personal connection.
"Ashley, that's so funny.
My cousin’s married to Ashley.”
Is my cousin really married to Ashley?
Absolutely not, I'm a total liar.
(Laughter)
But none of you will forget
the name Ashley.
And neither will I.
And neither will we forget Nanjera,
after I said her name multiple times.
Nanjera, I think -- again, rouging
of the cheeks, little sweat.
Your person is alive also.
Nanjera: Correct.
OP: Now, what I do in my profession
is I take things that appear
to have limitless possibilities
and break them down.
People that are famous,
there are several, kind of, categories.
I'm going to say them quickly,
you don't have to nod,
but we had a conqueror,
let's call it a historical figure.
We have singers, movie stars,
athletes, comedians, politicians,
already registered a hit.
Too funny you did this.
Alright.
Shouldn't have smiled,
tighten it up, Nanjera.
(Laughter)
Three days ago,
I did a show in Dallas, Texas.
Dallas, Texas.
And the last person standing
thought of a singer.
It's always singers where this happens.
I got his singer correct
and he didn't sit down.
And do you know what he said to me?
I go, you know, why isn't he sitting down?
He goes, "Oh yeah?
What song am I thinking of?"
(Laughter)
I'm like, buddy, this is not Netflix.
(Laughter)
Always singers.
Tell us all,
who, in your mind, is sitting
across from you, having dinner?
You're on the edge of your seat.
What's their name?
Nanjera: Bob Dylan.
OP: I couldn't hear you.
Nanjera: Bob Dylan.
OP: Can I ask you a question?
I always like this.
Everyone, listen to me.
I call this the grass is greener approach.
I can always see it
when someone's eyes shift.
She goes, "Mm, I like Bob Dylan,
but I actually had
someone else in my mind."
You thought of someone else.
It's in the back of your head,
but you just shifted.
Can you tell me --
Folks --
(Laughter)
This is not my first rodeo.
(Laughter)
Who was the first person you thought of?
(Laughter)
Tell us.
Nanjera: Trevor Noah.
OP: Ooh. It's not a singer.
Ooh.
Don't ever doubt me again, TED,
don't you ever doubt me again.
(Applause and cheers)
Jeff.
Do you know what the most common
question I get at the end of a show is?
Other than, of course, "How do you do it,"
is, "Aren't you afraid
of getting it wrong?"
That's what I get asked,
because people understand
that there is risk involved in what I do.
This is not sleight-of-hand
card tricks that work every time.
And so the answer is,
yeah, of course, of course I am.
You know what?
Because what's fascinating to me
is people can feel the element of risk.
And I think the number one
factor in success,
both on stage and in every
facet of my life,
is an unshakable belief that it will work.
It's self-fulfilling.
And in this case, it's not a belief
that I'm going to guess your person.
Been there, done that.
I don't plateau, Jeff, I peak.
So I am not going to read your mind.
I want to empower someone
in this room to do it instead.
This Frisbee --
(Laughter)
Was purchased on Amazon Prime,
free two-day shipping, 87 cents.
It has a 1.5-star review.
(Laughter)
This is literally the worst
Frisbee in the world.
(Laughter)
Please, sir, grab that.
Tell me your first name.
Person: Dylan.
OP: That's correct.
(Laughter)
Stand up, Dylan.
The Frisbee is made out
of mesh, everybody.
Which means if it hits you
in the face, it will not hurt.
But it will hurt your pride
if this goes viral on TED Talks later.
Everyone hands up in defensive posture.
Dylan, close your eyes so you can't
even try to aim this piece of junk.
Throw it.
Someone catch.
Give it a throw, please go.
Oh, my God, is that far?
Mike runner, run, run, run.
Stand up, stand up!
(Applause)
Please stand up.
What is your name?
Did you say Brett?
Person: Yeah, Brett.
OP: Have you ever met or spoken
a word to Jeff Johnson before?
Brett: I actually haven't.
OP: OK, maybe more networking
at the next breakout session.
(Laughter)
Please, Brett, come on up.
Give him a huge round of applause,
make your way up, Brett.
Two Ts, I like the way you roll, Brett.
Not going to forget
that name, are you now?
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Brett, I’m bringing you front and center.
Let's adjust this to the height
my wife wishes I had.
(Laughter)
She is watching this now live
and saying "That's true."
Brett, here's what you're going to do.
I'm going to ask you in a moment --
Have you ever spoken
to me a word in your life?
Brett: I haven't.
OP: He seemed happy
about that, that was weird.
I'm going to ask him in a moment
to close his eyes.
You need to believe it
in order to achieve it.
When you close your eyes,
I am going to ask Jeff to uncap a marker.
And you're going to write the person.
Very important, Jeff,
you thought of one person,
is that correct?
Jeff: That's right.
OP: Because, you know,
Nanjera is like, having dinner.
She's like, load it up,
let's get a six top.
Brett, close your eyes.
His eyes are closed.
Brett, keep your eyes closed.
Jeff, open up your marker, please.
As big as you can, so we can't see it,
write down the first and last name
of the person you are imagining
sitting down to dinner with.
Brett, open your eyes.
You have to believe it
in order to achieve it.
Look, not into his eyes,
look into his soul.
And when I snap my fingers,
tell him, who is he having dinner with?
Brett: Barack Obama.
OP: Turn it around!
Show everybody, show everybody.
(Cheers and applause)
Thank you, Brett.
(Cheers and applause)
I am Oz Pearlman,
thank you very much, everybody.
