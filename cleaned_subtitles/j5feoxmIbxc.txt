Political tensions are high.
Division seems to be everywhere
and celebrities are no
exception.
For example, in September,
thousands of actors
and filmmakers signed an open
letter calling for a boycott of
Israeli film groups over
the war in Gaza.
In response, another group of
actors and filmmakers signed
an open letter rejecting
the boycott.
So what's at stake?
When celebrities express views
many see as divisive?
What can they gain?
What can they lose?
And do their views even actually
make a difference anyway?
I asked Tim McLaughlin,
a crisis communications
strategist, and Amil Niazi,
a freelance writer
and cultural critic.
To Amil, thank you so much
for joining us on the program.
How are you doing?
>> Good, good.
Thank you.
>> There's an attraction with
people in terms of wanting
celebrities to speak out,
and I want to get a better
understanding of why.
Why do we why do we look
to celebrities to speak out
whether it's first
or when something is happening
in the midst of it?
Why do we why do we?
Why are we drawn to them?
>> Yeah.
You know, I think as culture
has evolved, we want we
sort of have built this
parasocial relationship with
celebrities, influencers.
You know, I think we really
live in a very influencer-led
culture right now
where we have a desire for
an intimacy and a connection
and a very personal connection
with our celebrities.
You know, we're used to seeing
them on Instagram, talking
directly to us on TikTok.
There's no longer that divide
where, you know, a publicist
controlled what a celebrity
said and how they reacted,
and you sort of only knew them
on the press tour.
Now you have access to them
24/7,
and they want you to have that
access because it it helps
build their brand.
But what comes along with that
is a desire then,
for them to speak about
the pressing issues of the day,
because it would be weird
for them not to.
Right.
The problem is that that's not
their expertise.
It is not really
necessarily something
that they should speak about.
They don't have a connection
to it.
And so you're left in this
awkward space where if they say
the wrong thing, they're
vilified.
If they say the right thing,
then now they are held to
a certain standard that they
have to maintain.
So it puts celebrities in
a very awkward position.
And I think that you're
going to see more and more
sort of, you know, things
like Jennifer Lawrence pop up
where they really just want to
say, I'm done speaking about
anything that's not my craft.
>> All right.
Well, this is what you do.
So I want a better
understanding of should public
figures be expected to be
experts on topics on issues.
>> You know, to Amil's point,
they're not experts in
these subjects.
So I think expecting
celebrities to have opinions
on every issue, every
hot button topic that comes up,
I just think that's, you know,
unfair to the celebrities.
They are experts at their craft,
whether it's music,
entertainment, art, whatever it
is, that's their expertise.
So expecting them to be experts
in each social issue or
politics, it's just an
impossible standard
to live up to.
And it also sets the precedent.
Once you speak out,
once you're then expected
your fans and your audience
is expecting you to chime in
to every single conversation.
So I think the the figure
then sort of loses
their identity as well
in that process.
Who are they without
the advocacy role?
You know, so I often think
it's in the celebrities'
best interest to
not chime into conversations.
And most often they have more
to risk by doing so.
>> I'm curious in terms of the
pressure that celebrities or
influencers might be getting,
is it from their following?
Is it what they're seeing
on social like?
I need to get into
this conversation.
>> Yeah.
I mean, once you have,
you know, your peer kind of do
something, then, you know, you
feel a certain degree of
pressure to, to align with that.
And certainly your, your
audience and your fan base,
you know, we're so engaged
and interacted online.
It's a two-way conversation
now.
So your, your fan base
really can say,
we expect this of you and the
celebrities are going to see
that and, and have a, you know,
perhaps want to respond to it
in order to try and preserve
the connection with that,
that fan base.
>> All right.
Let's talk about sort of
topics.
People are were quite
comfortable speaking up
on Jemmy Kimmel when he was
taken off the air.
Canadians
and Americans will remember on
SNL when, you know, Mike Myers
opened his shirt and showed,
you know, Canada is not for
sale and elbows up.
But there are other
conversations that
are a bit trickier.
Gaza.
Why is it that certain
topics require require
refinement?
Rightfully so.
But why are they trickier
to handle?
>> Well, I mean, you can just
extrapolate the comfort level
of having a conversation about
Gaza at work, sometimes even at
home amongst your friends.
Right?
Everyone has a very
often personal connection to it.
They are often, you know, ill
prepared to speak about the
context of this conversation.
And I think that people often
have a very visceral reaction
to the celebrities take, you
know, whether it's Amy Schumer
coming out and, you know, her
opinion or whether it's Hannah
Einbinder at the Emmys saying,
you know, go birds free,
Palestine, either side is going
to electrify the people who
care about the issue, whether
it's on this side or that side.
So if it's if it's a hot button
issue, you know, in any
circumstance, then of course
the celebrities speaking out
about it is going to be a hot
button issue as well.
>> To help peel the curtain
back a little bit.
What what should
a public figure consider
before they post or make
a statement?
Are these is there
conversations that you have had
with people to be like, okay,
let's, let's let's take a
moment here.
Let's take a breath.
What what do we encouraging
them to post or not post.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> I think half the battle is
having the conversation ahead
of time proactively, because
clients often come to me
in a reactive state.
They've posted something online
that's usually
emotionally driven.
And now we have quite a mess
to clean up because it wasn't
thought out, it wasn't
well-planned, and now
they're in over their head.
So if we can take a step back,
that's kind of the first piece
of advice is take a step back.
Let's think strategically about
this.
And look, I'm not here to
tell you one way or the other
if you should or you shouldn't
do it.
But what I'm going to
bring you through is a risk
assessment, and then you can
decide if it's worth it from
you, for you.
So we'll get a lay of
the landscape.
Understand.
You know, what's
the generally the popular
opinion on this topic?
Are you with the popular
opinion or are we going to
be fighting an uphill battle
here?
If you have a more unpopular
opinion, we're going to
look at your audience.
Are you going to lose a
significant chunk of your
fan base?
Does your audience expect
this of you?
Do they even care?
Or should you just stay in your
lane and then are there
financial repercussions?
You know, these celebrities
have brand deals.
They have, you know, contracts.
So does your contract allow you
to potentially chime in
in this conversation safely?
Are you going to risk
turning off brands
to wanting to work with you
because it's a
controversial topic.
So once we do that
risk assessment, it often opens
the client's eyes to say,
well, I don't know that
I want to put this deal or this
gig that I've booked at risk
by speaking out.
But sometimes they're closely
connected and feel
super passionately
about the issue.
And we can speak out
in a, you know, in a more
thoughtful way and do it
properly.
But I certainly recommend
that that risk assessment,
I think, is really critical
for understanding the
landscape.
>> You talked about Jennifer
Lawrence and a lot of these
situations.
The conversation is fluid.
Things are changing depending
on where you jump in.
It's kind of important.
And so actress Jennifer Lawrence
recently said she does not want
to take away from her craft
by speaking up anymore.
What's your take on
her statement?
>> I'm sort of divided on
something like that.
On the one hand, I agree
that I don't necessarily want
to hear from Jennifer Lawrence
on, you know, if Canada
should be a sovereign
country or.
>> Stay in your lane, okay.
>> Stay in your lane and and
often the best thing that they
can speak about is their craft
and how sometimes that
naturally intersects with
politics or what's happening in
the world, but oftentimes it
doesn't.
So she should just talk
about acting.
>> And to your point, she in
that clip, you know, she says,
I'm taking on roles that
reflect my.
>> Exactly.
She wants her art
to speak for her.
And I think a lot of creatives
feel the same way.
And they do want their art
to be the thing that, you know,
navigates those conversations
and you can perceive it however
you want.
And that's the conversation.
That's the debate.
On the other hand, it can come
across as cowardly that she
doesn't want to risk her brand
deals.
She doesn't want to risk,
you know, Givenchy or
Balenciaga or whatever.
I don't know what brand deal
she has, but when money's
on the table, that's when
people either show
their mettle or they, you know,
shirk away from these hard
conversations so it can be
perceived, I think, as sort of
the cowardly decision that you
don't you you don't know what
to say or you're not brave
enough to say it.
And so you're just sort of
saying, like, I'm
going to say nothing.
And, and as, as, you know,
from some of these
heated conversations
we've been having, silence can
speak volumes.
>> I am curious, though, how
much influence do they really
have?
Do they?
Does it actually move
the conversation outside of,
say, a, you know, a tweet
thread or an Instagram thread?
Is there actual movement on?
Sort of.
>> No, I don't think so.
Someone like Miss Rachel,
who who keeps it in the
conversation, who really this
is something that she believes
so strongly in and she's
willing to risk it all to, to
keep these kids at the
forefront.
Yeah, I think she could.
But for the most part,
you know, Jennifer Lawrence
saying XYZ is not going to have
a real tangible impact on the
conversation.
>> No.
All right.
We're going to talk about
Miss Rachel.
So let's bring this up.
As you mentioned, Miss Rachel,
very popular children's
educator, entertainer,
millions of followers
and has a Netflix
program as well.
She recently posted this.
It reads tag celebrities,
leaders and politicians
who have spoken out
about Gaza.
Let's thank them and follow
them.
And then she commented right at
the bottom there.
We won't forget who was
silent and who showed up to.
Is there something inherent in
this moment in social media
that makes praising and shaming
effective?
>> Well, there's sort of my
professional answer
and then my personal answer.
I want to kind of talk
about Miss Rachel, though,
first, because I think
she's one of the few.
She's certainly an outlier,
in my opinion,
but she's one of the few
that have done it right.
And I think she can be she can
dig into this conversation at a
deeper level than I think some
others.
Because her career started
on YouTube.
She owns that audience,
and she makes a very lucrative
career just through her YouTube.
The Netflix deals
and all of that came later.
So she doesn't rely
on that audience.
So I think that's the difference
for her, and it's clear
her passion about it.
It's not gimmicky.
It's not.
She's not feeling this pressure
from her audience to
say something.
It's true and it's from
the heart.
And she's connected.
The connection to her brand
is children.
She's led with that.
So I think that's what works
for her.
As for audiences putting
pressure on these celebrities to
to speak out or are shaming them
if they do or don't?
What I'm actually seeing a lot
of is, is, is bot farms
amplifying some of
this engagement.
So so it's become trickier
in today's age, you know,
this digital era to
differentiate what's legitimate
criticism and what's being
amplified by people with with
an agenda.
You know, shaming is
ineffective.
Shaming may, in
the short term provide,
you know, some benefit.
But over the long term,
studies show that shaming
is ineffective for
behavioural change and and
truly convincing someone that
their position is is wrong.
So I think, you know, this is a
personal opinion, but, you know,
the shaming culture to me is
just it's gone too far.
So that's on the shame side
of things.
And as for its impact
on celebrities, and if they do
or they they don't speak out,
we have to better understand
that that sentiment, if it's,
you know, if it's legitimate,
if it's true, and then kind of
do that risk assessment that I
mentioned.
>> All right, Amil, same
question here.
>> Yeah.
I think it's really
tricky because, you know, of
everything has said about the
legitimacy of who is sort of
like putting the pressure on
these celebrities.
Is it their fans
or is it, you know, sort of
trolls or, you know, people
with nefarious sort of
influence?
But I do think that
we are stepping out of a
shaming culture.
I think you're starting to see
more and more, if you recall,
like during the Black Square
era, you know, during
the pandemic when there
was a lot of pressure on
celebrities to post a black
square, to sort of let black
voices be amplified on social
media, it was a kind of an
absurd movement.
It proved very quickly
to be, you know, a
little bit of a joke.
Right?
And so it put, put the ones who
posted it in a very awkward
position and ones who didn't
post in a very awkward position,
and it wasn't legitimate in the
end.
So I think we're coming
out of a place where people
feel like they have to follow
the trend in the moment.
You know, at the same time
of the Vlack Square,
you also had a lot of notes,
apologies, you know,
celebrities sort of being
like, I'm sorry, I did this
thing.
And we had an expectation
they would apologise for
their mistakes.
>> More often than not, we see
apologies, don't move, don't
work, they don't work.
>> And people moved on.
So many things have happened
since that.
That was only like a month ago.
So much is in the news cycle
these days, like from Trump to,
you know, whatever.
Like there's just so much
that that changes so frequently
and so fast that celebrities
now don't really have to
say anything.
>> Yeah.
Because then your apology
then becomes the second
news cycle.
>> Becomes a joke, becomes
fodder for the trolls.
And so I feel like
we're stepping away from
that type of accountability
to something else.
And I feel like it is the
Jennifer Lawrence style, where
it's like, I'm going to say
nothing until it's my turn to
go on the press tour.
>> All right.
Well, we are unfortunately
going to have to leave it there.
As you said, there's so much.
>> There's so much.
>> So I'm sure that we will
have to come back to this
conversation.
Another point.
Thank you so much for your
insights. I really appreciate it
