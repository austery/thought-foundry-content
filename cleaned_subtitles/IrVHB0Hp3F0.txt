- I started out as an intern in pediatrics
and I would see one ear
infection after another,
and the kids were adorable,
but one ear infection
is pretty much the same as every other.
Whereas when you talk to
people about their lives,
it's never the same.
And I knew that that
would keep me interested
for my whole career, which it has.
- [Narrator] The secret to happiness.
- I became interested in
psychiatry unexpectedly.
I had never known a
psychiatrist growing up.
But when I was in medical school,
I found that the way people's minds worked
was the most fascinating
thing I could possibly study.
So I eventually found that
there was really nothing else
for me in medicine, but doing psychiatry.
I am the fourth director
of the Harvard Study of Adult Development,
and it is the longest study of adult life
that's ever been done.
We're in our 85th year.
It started in 1938
as two studies that weren't
even aware of each other.
One study started at Harvard
Student Health Service
with 19-year-old sophomores
who were thought by
their deans to be fine,
upstanding young men.
And the other study was a
study of juvenile delinquency
and it selected boys middle school age
from Boston's poorest families,
but also the most troubled families,
families beset by problems
like domestic violence
and parental mental illness
and physical illness.
This study set out to understand
what makes people thrive
as they grow and develop.
And that was unusual
because most research that's been done
is done on what goes
wrong in human development
so that we can help people.
But this was a study of what goes right,
so it was how do kids from
disadvantaged families
stay on good paths and develop well?
And then, of course, the
very privileged Harvard group
was meant to be a study of
normal young adult development.
We now know that if you wanna study
normal young adult development,
you don't just study
white men from Harvard,
but at that time, that's what they did.
We study wellbeing as
people go through life,
and our big question is,
if you could make one choice today
to make it likely that
you would stay happy
and stay healthy throughout your life,
what single choice would you make?
And most of us think it's
something to do with getting rich
or achieving a lot,
and some people even think
they need to become famous
to have a happy, healthy life.
But our study and many other studies show
that the single choice we can make
that's most likely to keep us
on a good path of wellbeing
is to invest in our
relationships with other people.
The people in our study
who had the happiest,
warmest relationships
were the people who stayed healthy longest
and who lived the longest.
The Harvard study started in 1938,
and it has followed the same people
throughout their entire lives,
from the time they were teenagers
all the way into old age.
The study began with 724 young men,
and then we brought in most of their wives
and eventually most of their children,
so that now there are over 2,000 people
in these 724 families who we have followed
through their entire adult lives.
We started collecting information
by giving these young men
elaborate psychological examinations,
also medical examinations.
Then we went to their homes,
we talked to their parents,
and sometimes even their grandparents,
and the workers made elaborate notes
about what was being served for dinner
and what the discipline
style was in the family
and even what the curtains looked like.
And then eventually,
as new methods of studying
human life came on board,
we adopted those methods.
So audio taping, videotaping,
we now draw blood for DNA,
and DNA wasn't even imagined
in 1938 when the study began.
We've put many of our
people into an MRI scanner
and watched how their brains light up
as we show them different visual images.
We bring them into our laboratory
and we deliberately stress them out,
and then we watch how
they recover from stress
as one more way of
understanding wellbeing.
One of the things that is more common now,
but was unusual when we started it
was combining biological measures
and psychological measures
and seeing how our biology is influenced
by our mental states and vice versa.
So it's this combining of
mind and body measurement
that was relatively new
in the last 20 years.
The question comes up,
how much of our happiness
is under our control?
And they've actually done some
scientific analysis of this.
A psychologist named Sonja Lyubomirsky
did an analysis in which she estimates
that about 50% of our happiness
is a kind of biological set point,
probably determined by our genes.
That has to do with inborn temperament.
We all know people who are
kind of naturally gloomy
and other people who are naturally chipper
no matter what's going on.
So about half of our happiness
is that inborn temperament.
And then about 10% she finds
is based on our current
life circumstances.
And then the last 40%
is under our control.
We can move the needle.
We can make ourselves
more likely to be happy
by building a life that
includes the conditions
that make for happiness.
The questions that we might ask ourselves
about our relationships
are kind of simple.
One is, do I have enough
connection in my life
or do I even have too much connection?
If I'm a shyer person
and don't need as many people in my life,
so do I have what I need?
And each person can check in
with themselves about that.
Then the question is,
do I have relationships that
are warm and supportive?
And there again, each of us
needs to ask that question,
do I have people who have my back,
who I feel I could call
and would be there in an emergency?
Because hard times are
always coming our way.
And then the question is also,
what am I getting from relationships?
Do I have enough people to have fun with?
Do I have enough people who
will loan me their tools
when I need to fix something in my house,
or who will drive me to the
doctor when I need a ride?
Do I have those kinds of friends?
One of the things we know about life
is that we all have worries.
We all have concerns that come along,
worries about children,
worries about health,
worries about finances.
And one of the best teachings I got
in my training as a psychiatrist
was from one of my mentors
who said, "Never worry alone."
And this teacher meant that about
being worried about a
patient who I was treating.
But what I've come to understand
that it's really good advice
for just about everything in life,
that if I'm really worried about something
and I share it with somebody I trust,
it makes all the difference
in how much better I feel
and how much less alone
I feel with my worry.
There are so many different things
we get from relationships,
and so each of us can
check in with ourselves
about what we have and what we
would like a little more of.
So we've learned several big
lessons about relationships,
about good relationships,
and one of them is that
childhood experience
really does matter.
What happens to us in
childhood sets the stage
for what we come to expect from the world,
and that's often a good thing
if we're raised by people
who are warm and caring and reliable.
Some people don't have that luck
and are raised in environments
where they feel like the
people who are supposed
to take care of aren't
trustworthy, can't be relied upon.
And so many of those
people come into adulthood
with the expectation that
the world is not a safe place
and that people can't be relied on.
The other thing we've learned
is that adult experience
can correct for some of
those unfortunate lessons
that people learn in childhood.
Becoming connected with a good partner,
with good friends who you can count on
can go a long way to change
those gloomy expectations
about the world and about relationships,
and allow us to realize that yes,
we can find people who are good,
reliable partners in our relational world.
So another lesson that we learn is that
all relationships that are
important have some disagreements
or some difficulties.
And that actually,
facing those difficulties
goes a long way to strengthen
relationships much of the time
so that if we can work on relationships,
that turns out to have great payoff
in terms of keeping our
connections stronger.
What that means is that it's
normal to have disagreements,
it's normal to have difficulties,
and that the more skill we can develop
in working through difficulties,
the better our social worlds are.
One of the biggest lessons
we learned from our study
is that our connections with other people
help us weather the hard times of life
and hard times are there in every life.
So our original participants
were born during the Great Depression
and many of the Harvard
undergraduates were of an age
to go and serve in World War II.
And when we asked them,
how did you get through
these really difficult times?
All of them to a person talked
about their relationships.
Our neighbors shared what little we had
during the depression.
My fellow soldiers in the trenches
were the people who kept me going.
The letters that came to me from back home
while I was overseas in the
war were what sustained me.
And so what we find is
that these connections
turn out to be the best protection
against the difficult times
that are always coming our way.
We are pretty sure that we human beings
evolved to be social animals,
that in fact, staying together in groups
made it more likely that we
would survive the dangers
that are out there in the world
and pass on our genes, which
is the goal of evolution.
So we evolved to find being together
secure and safe and to find
being alone a stressor.
And what we find is that
that is still the case,
that people who are more isolated
than they want to be are stressed.
Loneliness is a big stressor,
and we think that that
is biologically based
as well as emotionally based.
The best hypothesis
about how relationships
get into our bodies
and affect our physical
health is through stress,
that we're having stressful experiences
often all day long, and that's normal.
And that when we're
stressed, the body is meant
to go into what we call
fight or flight mode,
where essentially heart rate
goes up, might start to sweat,
a variety of changes happen.
But then when the stressor is removed,
the body is meant to
return to equilibrium.
What we think happens is that
if I have something stressful
happen during the day
and I can go home and talk
to a friend or call someone,
I can literally feel my body calm down.
If I don't have anyone I can talk to
about something that happens
in my life that's stressful,
we believe what happens is we
stay in a kind of low level
chronic fight or flight mode.
And what that means is
that we have higher levels
of circulating stress
hormones like cortisol.
We have higher levels of inflammation
going on in the body all the time,
and that these changes gradually wear away
different body systems,
which is how stress and loneliness
could make it more likely
that we would get coronary artery disease
and more likely that we
would get type two diabetes
or arthritis could affect
multiple body systems
through this common
denominator of chronic stress.
Our understanding is
that good relationships
actually are emotion regulators,
that what happens is
that good relationships
involve the exchange of positive emotion
that helps our bodies stay in equilibrium.
So in fact, they've put
people in MRI scanners
and watched what happens to them
when they go through a
stressful medical procedure,
and they find that if they're
holding someone's hand,
even a stranger, but
certainly someone they know,
their bodies stay much
closer to equilibrium
than if they're alone undergoing
the same medical procedure.
And so what it shows us
is that being connected to another person
makes us feel safer and keeps our bodies
at a kind of physiologic
equilibrium that promotes health.
A toxic relationship is one
where we can't get beyond
difficulties, unhappiness, anger.
We can't come out the other side
to a place where we're
okay again with each other.
And so a toxic relationship
involves unhappiness,
even if you're quiet about it.
Chronic resentment, often withdrawal,
and then active arguing.
On the other hand,
couples argue all the time
without having these detrimental effects.
What we've found from our research
is that couples can argue
often and quite vocally,
but if there is a bedrock
of affection and respect,
those relationships continue
to be positive and stable.
Research shows us that loneliness
is certainly a stressor
and that we have increased
levels of stress hormones,
increased levels of chronic inflammation,
but research also shows us that
ongoing acrimony in a relationship,
constant arguing and unhappiness,
is also hazardous to our health
for just the same reasons.
So there was in fact
a study that suggested
that staying in a really
toxic intimate relationship
may be worse than splitting
up for that reason
because a really difficult
acrimonious relationship
is that source of chronic stress
that keeps us in fight or
flight mode most of the time
and breaks down our body systems.
The research shows that people
who have a secure connection
with a partner in late life
have slower brain decline.
In addition, the research shows
that people who are lonely in late life
have more rapid brain decline.
So we know that this same
process of increased stress
or decreased stress
affects how our brains age.
