[Applause] [Music] now I I can't quite hear you conversation there you can hear me now now I can yeah all right but here it's super safe so uh no problem was great I loved it I love the opening I loved the video yeah same here we have fantastic people here and uh yeah it takes a toll on them once in a while you know yeah so um psychological safety why do we need it as investors and what does it look like well I I think you need psychological safety as investors because your success depends on your ability to make high quality bets now you might not like the word bets you might prefer decisions or Investments but make no mistake they bets right there there's uncertainty in in in in that way um and those are absolutely dependent on high quality conversations and high quality conversations are dependent on psychological safety they require that people lean in and say the uncomfortable truths when they they raise an idea they raise a concern they raise a dissenting View and the conversation includes sort of questions and answers and and and makes thoughtful progress toward an uncertain resolution but one that people feel is is high enough quality to go forward right so what does it look like it looks like a sense of permission for cander it does not look comfortable you know in fact it it probably looks a little uncomfortable because it's not natural and normal to sort of to lean in with the thoughts you have that you're not absolutely sure are right or helpful yeah so so the obvious question is also when it becomes kind of um unsafe it it becomes unsafe once in a while anytime but when it becomes like chronically unsafe what what do we do any advice to the audience ah yeah I mean because when it becomes chronically unsafe what what you end up with which by the way is invisible and I think that's really important you know to recognize the the asymmetry um here because you can hear when people speak up you cannot hear when they hold back you just don't know that there actually is something in their heads that they're not sharing so so in a sense as a leader you have to assume that it may be happening and that that it may put you at risk and and the quality of the work at risk so I think what the the place to start is just and it may seem you know old or redundant but keep reminding people of the nature of the work you're doing that the work you're doing necessarily includes uncertainty right it necessarily benefits from diverse perspectives or backgrounds that you know that that have a different angle on the situation um and so it's it's um when I and why why does that matter because when you are reminding people of the uncertainty and what's at stake you're setting a kind of intellectual rationale for why it actually makes sense that you do care about their voice so it's so you actually focus on the on the why we need it so the the drivers not so talking too much about psychological safety might have backfire a bit no no in fact some ways if if I had my brothers I'd recommend don't talk about it at all it just talk about what does a high quality conversation look like how Does it include people you know really taking those risks to share their thoughts and being willing to listen intently in the moments when they're not speaking right so that together we are making progress toward the best possible decision we can make all right so so this psychological safety goes a bit up and down so it fluctuates a bit so but how vulnerable is it really from your perspective maybe that's a bit too Global question yeah I mean this is the this is sort of the problem is that it's it's actually quite ve vulnerable um and I I think there's two asymmetries uh that that that people need to internalize uh and sort of intellectually and maybe emotionally as well and one is what I call the risk reward calculus right and that's the if I mean imagine a moment where you are weighing maybe not entirely consciously but you're you're you're weighing whether or not to speak up about something to share a thought a view and in that moment if you were to speak who gains well the team you know the the the um the organization if you will how confident are you that your voice will produce a gain not very and when will that gain occur well sometime down the road now if you because you're not quite sure stay silent who gains you do right you stay you stay safe and comfortable for another minute when does that gain happen immediately how confident are you that your silence won't produce a bad outcome 100% so that's a pretty profound asymmetry you know when you think about it you realize that leaders actually have to go on a treasure hunt because otherwise the risk reward calculus will get you every time and and I think the other um the other is the asymmetry between um the the good and bad exchanges right so if I have U you know and maybe it happens rarely but if I have a bad a bad reaction to my taking a risk and speaking up and someone is dismissive or judgmental or you know even um you know downright humiliates me I will not try again for quite some time whereas if I have a good response it won't sort of preclude me from trying again but it doesn't necessarily make it that much easier it just doesn't make it harder right so again the degree to which I'm willing to try again goes vastly down if I have you know one humiliating moment and so given you know given those those sort of asymmetries you have to um you have to sort of I guess I guess I'm just answering your question wholeheartedly which is you are vulnerable yeah makes sense I think I think we all can relate to that as well so so one misunderstanding or uh or what what we ended up uh realizing sometimes is that people when we talk a bit about psychological safety we have to open the box a bit and then we talk about it and then people may be missed the point so they're trying to make it comfortable but for no particular reason performance- wise so like you get points for making it safe but like you forget to to draw the link between that what's what's your advice for those misunderstandings yeah yeah I mean I think my my Dev is again to to not again but to come to come to that um constant sort of appreciation of the knowledge intensive really intellectual work that you do um you know and that's that's different from say high-risk work in a you know in a a power plant or an aluminum plant or something like that but there is some there are some ways in which you have it in common which is that both require a sense of of of vigilance of very um thoughtful conscious inter relationships with others I'm interrelating meaning I want to listen to you closely I want you to listen to me closely we want people to be paying attention um and doesn't mean you have to be you know completely on all the time there are breaks of course and there are you know we we want people to you know leave at the end of the day go for a run whatever you know whatever works for you but but that that sense of awareness that the knowledge intends of intellectual work you do requires a kind of um alertness and an and an engagement to do it well um and you know what what allows people in high-risk Industries to perform well and to avoid sort of catastrophic accidents or worker uh accidents is not a kind of um I don't know a blind spot about failure but quite the opposite it's like a almost a preoccupation with failure they are aware you know that around every corner is a potentially fatal accident and because of that they sort of bring their aame to the moment to the moments that need it and all I'm suggesting is you can bring your aame to the moments that need it and it it's it requires um vigilance it requires a little bravery you know and it requires just kind of an appreciation for for what's at stake all right thanks for sharing that isn't it interesting us nerding about you know on the psychological safety part so guess what Amy has written this great book I just finished it uh the right kind of wrongs is the name is a book about failures way great fun what fun so so you separate so so I think sometimes having a language around failures and doing things wrong is like uh digging or have some more Precision to it and you you have an interestes um separation between basic complex and intelligent failures can you clarify a bit sure sure so a basic failure is a failure that occurs in familiar territory usually because of human error just a single dumb mistake leads to a basic failure for instance in 2021 a City Bank employee accidentally checked the wrong box in an online form and accidentally transferred $900 million to a group of lenders right and then later a judge uh made a controversial ruling that did not allow City Bank to reclaim those funds right so it was a single human error maybe not paying attention maybe not well trained I don't know that led to a failure that we would all consider fairly sizable that was nonetheless basic so basic doesn't mean small or big you know it's a basic failure when you forget to charge your phone and you know Miss a meeting whatever but some of them are big some of them are small basic complex failures are ones with um the perfect storms they're the they're the failures that inevitably happen in you know relatively familiar territory when a handful of small deviations from best practice come together in just the wrong way to create a failure a supply chain breakdown in a global pandemic for instance again basic failures can be I mean complex failures can be small or large but there the what makes what's different is that any one of those factors on its own those small deviations wouldn't produce a failure it it was The Perfect Storm the way they came together neither basic nor complex failures are worthy of Celebration right they're not useful like when we're at our best we can prevent them I mean some of them will slip through I understand that and that's okay we're human but when we're at our best we don't need to have those they they bring us learning but not a whole lot of new learning in contrast what I call intelligent failures are those that uh explicitly occur in New Territory they are the undesired results of thoughtful experiments so a failure for a failure to be intelligent um we must not yet have the knowledge we need to get the result we want so it's new territory much of your work is in New Territory by definition yeah it's in pursuit of a goal whether that's making money or you know mastering a a skill or making a scientific discovery you have a goal number three it is um hypothesis driven you've you've you've taken the time to figure out what we know what we don't know and you've made a good bet and then finally for a failure to be intelligent it should not be any larger than necessary to get the new knowledge right so this is what scient do every day uh but I would argue in your business you are doing this uh as well athletes also do this yeah trying to yeah trying to get into new territory uh you're stretching and it doesn't always work yeah so uh new territory we need to take risk and we should celebrate it because we don't know it's hard to yeah you have to train yourself to say Okay that was disappointing and it's still valuable right it brings us something we did not know before yeah and all territory so we we're all human beings we had some erors small today you know things happen uh we should uh get them out in in the open so we can identify them learn from them and maybe who knows we might even prevent them next time but uh yeah exactly so that's useful just uh before we run out of time here um Amy so um we see that in this Marathon sport um you become world champions of uh committing mistakes or doing doing something wrong and yeah so but so you want to focus on the on the wins right but I can see it takes a toll on quite a few people any advice this is I suppose this is my job but uh any advice yeah uh how can people travel light but still remain their because we're long term we want people to last be years I think you know part of it is having a a more you know training yourself to have a more rational response to the disappointments I andan I think we have a natural response that's quite emotional and we believe you know at some level We Believe well that shouldn't have happened and it's it it it it exhausts us in a way to think that way and when we learn to master the pause you know just insert that space between the stimulus and our response we can then think more rationally about the situation okay that's disappointing and what do we learn from it what actually happened and how do we use it uh to go forward it's a almost a Relentless forward F Focus we care about the past because the past is full of learnings but our our our focus is on on the future and and what do we do with all that valuable learning that's good advice I just haven't off the burner I need to ask you Amy uh this psychological safety really strike the chord researchers applied PR practitioners organizations have used it to become better where are the herds going in social sciences now do you think you know I I I I I don't really know it seems to me all anyone can talk about is AI so maybe it's AI nudges that help us Master the pause that help us you know sort of be brave uh be more rational I don't know but um we'll we'll have to just wait and see this was great Amy thanks for joining us bye thanks for having me thank you [Music]
