[Music] Pixar has dominated the world of animation with titles like Toy Story Finding Nemo The Incredibles cars Monsters zc the firm has won 27 Academy Awards and today we are in the very very good company with Ed catull who started it with Steve Jobs and John ler now Ed also wrote the best book I have ever read about creativity namely creativity. in if you haven't read it you should run out and buy it so at what an honor to have you on the podcast it's my pleasure to be here um Ed when you started Pixar what was your vision for the firm well initially the vision was just to make the first animated film and uh in the process of doing that I and we transferred from like a technical Vision to a a management and a cultural vision and it took a while to figure this out many years of observing other companies making mistakes and learning but also finding that managing for me personally was extremely interesting so I went from being a technical person to a manager but evolved over time no training it's just all learning as you go observing and learning from the mistakes As You observe this and as you um worked what kind of Cultural Mission do did you have well I I was fortunate in that when I started off in graduate school my first two teachers later received the touring award for entirely different reasons one of them was Alan Kay who pretty much ingrained me the notion that things were going to change at an exponential rate but the other one was from Ivan Southerland who was basically saying it doesn't matter what your big vision is you got to solve the problem now so these are the two sides of it but one of the more important things was that when I was at in graduate school I loved the culture it was supportive everybody was in This Together there was no real class structure and when I left I just said to myself this is the kind of environment that I would like to have for the rest of my life one of the things you talk about in your book what actually about three important points in terms of getting Collective creativity one is that uh you uh should put the cre the creative Authority in the hand of a project leader rather than a an executive wh why is that important projects need leadership with them but at the same time if everything is topped down then that means the person who is at the top of the company is making the decisions but the person at the top of the company actually often doesn't know exactly what what's going on so um from my point of view it meant that the people who are running and this included Steve Jobs too who was our um the uh the chairman of the M investor was that we didn't pretend to be filmmakers that you have filmmakers there and they have to make the decisions but we also know those decisions are hard they're tough um you uh essentially have to trust TR them because nothing works when you start and if you don't do that then they're not solving the problems you don't want to become their problem you want them to own the problem of making the film you also talk about uh the importance of sharing work in progress which is for many people quite difficult why um tell us why it's important to just share your work I think this true with life in general and with with projects is that if you're taking on anything that's important then it requires a lot of people they're all participating in it and you have to think of them as co-creators and if you're going to treat them like co-creators then they have to be engaged in the problems which means that since you know you're going to have problems at the beginning that I can't even judge whether or not something is good because it has problems the only judge that I have of of had of of any project was whether or not the team was functioning well together if they're functioning well if they're laughing and they're struggling with each other then they are much more likely to solve the problems and if they're not getting along with each other or they or the leader loses the trust in the people then they're not likely to solve the problem so the the measure is the health of the group not not whether or not the Project's working because the project is the problem so they may struggle and I'm not looking at the fact that they're struggling it's are they going are they working together you also uh talk about the the importance of dismantling natural barriers and and silos and so on um tell me about that well the natural uh tendency in organizations is to optimize something and make it work work group in other words even though they don't like silos people tend to make them just a natural tendency in organizations um and so if you point this out that they're doing something that they don't actually particularly like then they're more open to sort of breaking down those doors and what it means is paying attention to little details in the case of the Pixar building which I believe is the best building I've ever worked in in my life was the middle of the building was an open space where people crossed and had to cross to get around the building so it was designed to have all the the community things at the center our theaters we had three theaters to show films in process our eating area our meeting rooms our bathrooms were all at the center so everybody had a reason to cross um it's just paying attention to those kinds of details which caused inadvertent encounters to take place what were some of the other things that you liked with the building the decor was uh clean but at the same time all the walls like the walls to the animators were painted white and the reason they were painted white was they were encouraged and allowed to do whatever they wanted to these buildings I me to these rooms and they just did strange things some of them cut holes in the walls and Facilities supported that so nobody was saying don't touch this or don't paint this I like knock yourself out and they did they did some of the strangest things and it gave a an organic feel to the building but organic in the sense that the people working in the spaces were the ones who made the changes there isn't any facilities group that's saying don't do that their job is do that and the only requirement is don't break fire code laws now um you mentioned Steve jobes um when you compare him with other CEOs what sets him apart what set him apart over the course of my life with him and I worked for Steve longer than anybody else um when I first knew him he was like that kind of person who got kicked out of apple and uh which was not a good behavior so I knew him when he he was there and that's what people write about and make the movies about but Steve was so smart that I watched him learn from his mistakes and he went through an arc in his life and probably in the years of 1991 through 995 he dramatically changed he got married his son Reed was born um Pixar made its first film and was successful when Pixar went public in '95 it was his first success since being forced out of apple and uh in the process he became empathetic and after he changed the people who are with Him stayed with him for the rest of his life so that's sort of like the arc part of the story but the other one was the sheer um Brilliance and the understanding of change so as I mentioned he didn't tell us how to make the films at at Pixar never did nor did he ever tell me how to do technology or what computers to use what software to use so that was my domain um he was just a fierce protector of what we were doing and we were very different than Apple but the other thing which I don't think people realized was Steve relationship with the people around him this is where the mythology about Steve actually isn't M doesn't match up with the reality so as an example at Pixar we were a public company for 10 years during that 10 years Steve fired two members of the board of directors and the reason he fired them was they never disagreed with him and he said if they don't disagree with me they're not bringing any value to the company his people favored the phone over the iPad and they disagreed and they convinced Steve they think well he was always making the right decision the right decision was to have strong people who disagreed with you but you all had a common interest in mind how important has it been for you Ed to have people around you who disagree with you well it's one of the those things that has been emotionally um one of the most gratifying things I had at Pixar was when I go into a meeting then I was just one of the people throwing out ideas we'd have these intense discussions and the reason it was emotionally gratifying was even if we didn't solve the problem and we didn't agree when I walked out of that meeting feeling like that all of us own the problem they weren't looking at me and saying what should we do you're the leader make the decision it's like we're all in this together I mean we were together for years and years and years because in fact we felt like a like a say like a squabbling family but a family was holding together on you know solving difficult problems what's the key to creating that kind of family and that kind of atmosphere where people can disagree in a constructive manner well I I think part of it is is genuinely appreciating the contributions of others and setting up an environment where they're all that way too that is they want to hear what the others have to say so when we set up our Brain Trust which people find kind of interesting but there are a few keys to the Brain Trust one of them is the the Brain Trust actually doesn't have any Authority explain what the Brain Trust is we understood at the beginning that you get lost in your own project you lose objectivity so it's very important to have an outside force who is understands the business or the project and will question what you're doing um but at the same time they have a vested interest in your succeeding so we started with our first few films there was a person down at Disney's Tom schum marker who was that outside force he would just challenge what we were doing we didn't often didn't agree didn't matter he was the outside force but we appreciated it but at some point he was going to go he went up to the theatrical in Disney back in New York we were going to lose the outside force so we thought we need to make our own outside force which was this group of the leaders who could then challenge other people people's films all right that didn't work the reason it didn't work was we're all in the building together we're not really outside but what we did find in the process of doing that that it was remarkably effective at surfacing problems so we just evolved to figure out how to do this and one of the rules we realized right away was that this group couldn't override the director all they were was giving uh feedback and notes but by removing the power from the room it was now about the discussion of the project itself um my role there was actually to look at the Dynamics of the room my job was is this group working well are they being honest with each other and why if they aren't being honest why are people afraid to say what they think do they not want to look bad in front of others are they tried to impress each other but there are all kinds of things that are human reactions that can get in the way okay well what are they and how do we address them and we ended up with a a group that in general was extremely effective focusing on the problem giving their notes and then moving on then the team that's over the film later has to go back with those notes and think about what they mean and and figure how to address the problems but they don't have to take the solutions that were offered you never call anything a failure you just say that it it doesn't work how come well one thing to not is the word failure is really loaded because it's got two meanings one of them is that you screwed up you didn't work hard you know can and in business and in government failure is used as a bludgeon with which to beat opponents so um there there's actually really negative consequences that can come with failure itself but there's another meaning of failure which is that we all fail we all learn from it but it's almost impossible for people to uh separate these two meanings of failure but if you look at the learning part of it which is what we're really trying to focus on here what it really means is you tried something and it doesn't work and if that's your mindset then you're just saying okay let's try this that didn't work that calling a failure doesn't help the other thing is that once in a while we do have failures like something is really got screwed up but you reserve the word failure for a real failure not for the fact that you're just everybody's trying to do their best to solve the problem and they don't need somebody they're going to get bludgeoned with it and they actually need the confidence that let's try this and I'm not going to get damaged by it but if you do have if you do have a proper failure how did you how did you deal with it well a a proper failure would be as an example where after trying and trying to fix something like we've got let's say a leadership problem on a film all right so people are having problem with a direct director and they don't feel the director is listening or responding and in other words we do everything we can to protect the team but if the team loses confidence in the leader then that's a problem so then we try to shore them up we will add people to the team or make some changes but in the end if it can't work then we will replace and have replaced the director on the film The the truth is when you put somebody in the role and you think they can do it you are always taking a risk but you need to do that you need fresh voices you need new viewpoints but you're also giving them a role they've never had before some rise to it some don't honestly I can't tell ahead of time which means every once in a while you got to go in and and and figure out or or put a new leader in your book you talk about periods where you you guys were just working insanely hard and for instance uh for Toy Story 2 you you finished that in record time what's the kind of key to managing people during those super stressful times well the key is that everybody really wants this to work they have a vested interest in the company and for me it was one of the most important things is that it wasn't like we as the the leaders are saying this is the insane goal it's like we've got an insane problem we have to solve and we all need to get together to solve this problem so they come in with a a mindset and part of the insane work was that they were working hard to solve the problem in fact after that one that one was pretty insane actually it was too insane um because it was just physically hard on people but there are a lot of films after that where we had to put of restrictions in place because people would overwork because they were trying to impress or they're trying to do more than was necessary for the film that wasn't good for them or good for the film so that's a it was a tricky balance but I like the fact they really wanted to do great work but we were in this for the Long Haul so there's another side to this which is people overworking when they shouldn't be overworking anded you have uh created some of the most memorable characters uh in the history of of film making um well first of all what's the what is your favorite character well I I would it's not so much a character the first thing to note is that because I was there during the making the films I don't see them in the same way that other people do I can't I'm not the objective Outsider um so every one of these films has a story behind it there are probably like four or five films which uh rise to the top for me not only is films but also the story behind them so one of course is Ratatouille uh which is such an an unlikely story uh it's also one where the original director who's a lovely man he's the one that conceived the idea he designed the characters he designed the set but he was stuck and we had to replace him and um we replaced him with Brad Bird who basically was a is a brilliant writer and he solved the problem of of the movie so if you look at the final movie it's the realization of the original pitch which came from somebody else but it would not have been that great movie without this Insight that Brad had and his incredible sense of dialogue and then it it took it to an utterly different level what is the key to good storytelling well um the storytelling in in general if you think about it like if you read a book to a child what's the important part is you're holding the child in your lap and you're reading to them um it's it's a personal connection and uh we we see stories throughout our life some are well written some are just you know locked off filling a requirement when you're doing podcasts you're essentially telling and hearing stories and stories are one of the most important things we have to communicate with each other so if we're telling a story uh or books or movies or Broadway plays is we really want to communicate with people now I know some stories are just to inform some are to entertain but the best movies are the ones which connect to people that you walk out you will had a good experience but you also walk walk away with something that you've connected with what's the key to create that connection well I believe that um it's you know a a couple of people who are leading this like the director and the writer who have got a concept that they want but the the reason you have other people involved in it is you want to have the experiences from other people you want other people around there telling stories from their own lives or their own experiences or things they see and there's a richness with Gathering each of these and then figuring out okay what is it that's going to make this unique but good storytelling also and good movie making requires that it also be engaging so one does have to pay attention to the entertainment and since we have family films there's got to be some humor involved with it that holds people long because you want to have uh all ages you're combining the adventure the humor uh the looks the appearance the lightings the lighting um all of these elements which are part of good movie making something which conveys you know you a few ideas into an hour and a half and when you develop characters what is the key to developing memorable characters well we have character designers uh who are trying to make the characters appealing even the villains are meant to be appealing just at a at a visual sense so that's one level of the character and the other is how they're animated you look at the at the animation and and say well they're just moving around but the animators have got incredible senses of vision that is they're seeing things that most of us don't see uh at a conscious level like where our eyes look uh the Twitches on our face our body language uh is something that we do see even if we're not aware of it consciously aware of it we're still subconsciously reading what's going on with body language and a good animator does see that and puts that into the character I give an example this back from Toy Story two where um the girl Jesse is talking about her life but she's taking the braid and she's twisting it almost nobody consciously remembers that she was twisting her hair but when you see that you know know that that's a sign of her anxiety that's what what what animators do is to see things that are catches at a different level so at a movie you've got like three different levels of communicating you've got the body language you've got uh the actual uh animation itself you know the motion and then you got the words that they say and what it's interesting when those different levels are actually at odds with each other if you say that you're happy but you're doing physical actions with your body which says you're nervous or you're afraid then your brain picks up and say okay now it's interesting because what they're saying doesn't match what they're doing but that's true in life it's like let reading body languages is like okay I can tell that what they're saying is not what they really mean why what's the best way to um develop talent in a creative organization we published everything we did we had some competitors who didn't because they thought they wanted secrets and our view was we want to participate in the community and it wasn't because we were you know religious Believers in open source it was because it's all a talent play if you participate and you are the place that people want to go to then you bring in the best talent so we went to Lucas film and it was the same thing George completely supported the fact that we wanted to publish everything and we brought in even more great talent and then Steve Jobs came in Steve is known for being secretive but he never questioned my decision to publish everything because he understood that everything we did was about bringing good talent well then we reached the point where we brought in John and John understood that this was all about getting Talent so his first two hires were Pete doctor and Andrew Stanton who were incredibly talented so essentially you've got two groups Who start off with the notion of this all about getting good talents we need to bring in extraordinarily good people now when you're doing good work then you're more likely to attract good people but it means you have to be open to bringing in new people I just love how uh you used openness and transparency to attract talent and and how that is more important than keeping secrets you know I'm I'm just a really believer in the same thing you you you say sometimes say smart people are more important than Gad dares what do you mean by that I mean the first thing is just to to acknowledge my own limits I learned early on about half of my decisions were a Croc half were good and I don't actually have a way of measuring that but I think it's important to understand that we are wrong more than we think we are and okay if you're wrong a lot then how do you get to good place well you bring in people who know things that you don't know which means if you're picking people and you can't even judge whether or not they bring value see you're you're measuring their ethics their work but um you're also taking a risk but the success rate if you approach it this way is actually really high so the number of people who rise the occasion uh I've always found is very good these have to be trusted most of them really want to succeed they don't all succeed but most do so um if they're smart and I'm referring to that in a fairly General sense like they're just really talented and you're looking for the potential and you hire based upon potential not upon whether or not they reached a certain level think you know level thinking is they've crossed the bar they can do the job no it it's what is the potential because the potential is good actually they'll catch up to what they need for the job very quickly how do you screen for potential in the case of of Pixar for instance the bugs life our second film the leaders of the film hired people who could do the job we had more hiring failures from that film than any other because that that was their Criterion could they do the job so I I talk with them a lot about it is know you hire for potential now the question is how do you hire for potential so I said well let's put together an intern program so they took eight interns the first year and they were amazing seven of those eight after they graduated came back and joined us they're they're still there and they're they're phenomenal um but they worked they did real work they weren't trainees in the sense they're watching as they came and so well let's give them real projects so they went back to school and said I get to work on a movie so the next year more people applied and you know I lost time I checked there were like 10,000 applications for most 100 positions so right to begin with you're hiring people who come in as a result of other people having been given real work and having had a good experience so now you can select from pretty good people and then you You observe them and then you see whether or not they work so the first filtering process actually is is pretty easy because we got off I think to a good start on that it's why I love uh you know graduate and summer intern programs because you just you just see people who got tremendous uh possibilities and you know uh abilities and they just deliver things that you never thought was possible I mean you're right that's it's um I don't know why people resist resistant to it but it's an awesome way to look at people and find people inredible and as you and as you point out they just bring something new and fresh to any organization anded you are the the most humble person we ever had on this podcast have you always been this humble I I don't I don't know the answer to that actually I was easily intimidated but even though I was intimidated by people in authority and EMP power it never affected whether or not I thought something was right or wrong um do you need to be humble to be successful in Creative Industries I think it's very important to understand and I think I did understand to begin with is that uh I really am wrong a lot of the time and I think if you sort of understand that you're wrong More Than You Think You Are and that you need other people um that you're in a better place and if you're successful um it doesn't mean it's because you made all these right decisions it's because there are a lot of people who were there making this work you know I frankly I have seen people who think that it was them who did it and it's you know it's a it's a negative it's a poison in the body to think that your success is because you did it yourself well that's a very profound um observation how do you think uh AI will change animation the one thing that that's happened over the course of my life is that while Moore's law has been a great key indicator the the the more important number is the the compound annual Improvement of performance per price so for 60 years years the annual compound rate has been 40% per year all right that's mindblowing all right and that's continuing even though Mor's law has essentially tailed off um and the actual rate is increased because with the use of of gpus and so forth the amount of computing is incredible now if you look at the last 10 years the aggregate Computing in the world has increased increas by a factor of 1 million in 10 years and in the next 10 years it's going to increase by 1 million the the amount of computing available in a either your portable device or your desktop will increase by a factor of 40 to 100 in the next 10 years so when you look at that rate which is kind of what we've lived through you know for me it's been the the last 50 years is it's going to change things dramatically for for good or for bad so the answer is will it affect uh animation absolutely it's also highly unpredictable so that's that's also been the course all along is that is it going to change things absolutely when the internet came along uh you could see was going to change everything was going to democratize information it also democratized disinformation we are going to go through dramatic changes without a doubt it's just that it's pretty unpredictable and I think that with something like this our values matter how we treat people matter and those other things which just what which aren't just about the technology but they're about our humanity and the way we work with people are going to be uh crucial as they've always been some people are good at it and some don't care talking about um humanity and focusing in on other things you go on um silent Retreats from time to time what are they about well um I was on one last week when I did this it was kind of scary because the that part of the brain which is always chattering and talking uh I always thought was me and it was it was actually in in slowing that down or stopping it to realize it isn't true it's it's a tool I have but um when I slow that down I it's a a calmer place to be so I've done two of them that have lasted for a month and some people do it for a very long period of time and uh it's a hard to describ State a lot of people are afraid of the concept of being quiet and so part of it is to realize oh there's nothing to be afraid of what do you feel like when you come out of a month of Silence he s it's a a calm that's I I typically have things I need to return to do but I can go out it with more equinity we have um a lot of um young people on this listening to this podcast what is your advice to young people you have 78 years of experience if you were to synthesize this down to a few pieces of advice for young people the one thing I've paid attention to recently is that some people want to get rich quick and for most people I've know who done just it wasn't their goal it was actually to have a personal goal which is one they feel good about it has nothing to do with wealth or anything like that it's like I want to make a contribution to the world and I know a lot who are that way they want to address some of the serious problems of the world today and um we know that we've got very serious like extremely serious environmental problems that are coming we've got unknown consequences of our newer Technologies with AI we can see the upside for them which is is going to happen we don't fully know the downside and so what are the the the ethics or the values that people have to bring to these changes which are coming for those who are young they're entering into a a time of significant change so it's an opportunity but in that opportunity which is one of dramatic change is to make sure you hold on to some core values while you do it to think about what are values and what do you want to do and what do you not want to do and how do you keep from getting lost and the other is to Value other people's talent because you are entering into a space where there other people who are very talented but you also have colleagues with you how do you establish relations with others and it was one of the my community that I was growing up with actually is not the entertainment Community it's the the sigraph community which is the group that developed computer Graphics which had such a profound impact those are my friends and they're friends because when I was young I joined with other people to solve other problems and uh you know we remained friends who participated my entire life I value that to younger people because I don't know what's going to happen you can't even repeat what I did you can't repeat the past so you you learn from it You observe but what you take away is okay how do we approach the coming changes and what are the challenges that are meaningful that we want to work on well Ed we um we can't repeat the past and for sure we cannot repeat uh what you have done so um a big thanks for being on the broadcast but an even bigger thanks for creating all the characters and fairy tales and for making our lives so much richer with what you've done so big thanks from all of us well thank you and I've enjoyed talking with you Nikolai bye guys
