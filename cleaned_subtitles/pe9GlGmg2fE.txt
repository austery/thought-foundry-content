Do your customers care about price?
Oh, boy.
They do.
I've been thinking about this a lot.
So I was I was,
you know, it's the end of the year,
so I'm doing numbers and all those things
you have to do when you have investors.
And I was looking at the price of French
fries specifically,
and we've been noted for the French fries
and the beef.
tallow fries and the best fries in D.C.
and whatever.
And I think they're on the menu right now
for 12 bucks an order.
And I was looking at an old menu of mine
from restaurant, you know, in 2019,
and they were all the same fries.
I've been making the same fries forever.
They were on the menu
for nine bucks an order,
and I was like, wow,
you know, we've really gone up.
12 bucks is kind of expensive
for an order of fries.
Like, is there any room for this?
And I started sort of digging
into the price of goods
and the labor involved
and realized that, like,
if I wanted the same sort of margins
on that $9 order fries
that I have on my now $12 order fries,
they would actually be 25 bucks.
Wow. So like, we've just sort of like the
the cost of goods is like eviscerated
sort of the margins on that.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal.
And I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy,
we were down in DC several weeks ago.
We were at that iaff conference and,
we had a great meal and we were in town.
We did indeed.
So we had a good meal. Yeah,
we went to a place called Butterworth's,
which is getting a lot of buzz.
Yeah, it's been getting a lot of buzz
for a while and sort of serves,
I don't want to say farm to table
because that's not really it,
but like an emphasis on organic tonic,
maybe like rarer cuts of meat.
I remember we had bone marrow,
which you love.
I love bone marrow.
The first time I ever ate bone
marrow was an all you can eat buffet
in Las Vegas.
And so it wasn't even the best bone
marrow.
But like, I ended up with a mountain
of empty bones on my plate.
I think for one of us, like,
like sort of rich.
Well, it's like I would say it's
like sucking the life force of an animal.
It's animal essence.
We had really good fries, which famously.
And we'll probably get beef tallow,
no seed oils, very,
very, very hip, very strong.
So I'm pretty sure we had,
something with foie gras, which I love,
I think I seem to recall
there was some left on the plate
and I was like, does anyone want this?
Does it? Can I take this bite?
Can I take this bite?
I cannot resist, fog. Right.
Anyway, it was a really good meal.
I love doing, restaurant episodes, period.
Because.
Or talking about the food industry.
Because if you want to understand
the economy, both in the sort of short
term like where we are on this, like
with food costs and labor costs and, how,
you know, free spending people are they're
a great snapshot in any given time.
They're just this perfect combination
of labor cost inputs and rent,
which is like the whole economy there.
There's
also the supply chain issue. Right.
And we did that whole episode on Cisco,
the dominant food
supplier to restaurants in America.
I doubt Butterworth uses
Cisco for obvious reasons.
But like where they actually source
their ingredients
is a really interesting topic. Right?
This is what I got to say,
which is that like there
there's perfect combination
of the snapshot at the moment
and then the big structural things
of how the economy works across the cycle.
So I really like restaurant episode.
There's also an interesting
cultural element in this.
And like everything is cultural
and political nowadays,
including the restaurant.
Yes, because Butterworth's has been
described as a sort of right wing.
Yeah, MAGA hangout.
So we should talk about that too.
Yeah.
I'm fascinated by the DC scene
because I was like,
oh, they're like Democrat bars
or Republican bars.
I don't do they mix?
You got to declare your political
allegiance before you walk in.
It's so and actually,
there's something really profound here
because I feel like this is happening
to brands of all types.
Right? Yeah.
Is this the right kind of brand that the
left coded brand is that everybody in DC.
Will have to choose
sides? You have to choose sides.
But anyway, it's funny, you know, because
we were there and our producer was like,
we should go to a lot of awards.
So I was like, oh, there's the MAGA
restaurant. Great. I want to check it out.
But when you go in, you know, it's
not like there's you wouldn't know it.
Let's say you.
Aren't wearing red hats and stuff.
But you would never know it at all.
You would never like.
At least the night we were there,
I didn't see any like,
white House notables that I recognized,
although apparently they do hang out there
from time to time.
But it's not like designed.
It looks just like a very nice,
normal restaurant.
A real good a great dining room.
So there is a bit of a clubhouse
element to it.
We should talk about the overall design
because it's pretty unique as well.
Well, when I tweeted, I was like, oh,
we had a great meal of butter
words on Twitter.
All these people respond
because, you know, apparently whatever.
Anyway,
it made the connection with, the, chef
and owner of the restaurant,
Bart Hutchins.
We really do
have the perfect guest there for it.
And talk about Butterworth's.
We're going to be speaking
with Bart Hutchins.
Bart, thank you so much
for coming on the podcast.
Yeah, thanks for having me, guys.
What does it mean?
What's a maga restaurant?
Oh, God.
Where do we start?
Is it so do you think of it if when,
when you see in the media there's like,
oh, this is like, do you conceive of it
the same way that it's written about?
What does that mean in your head?
So, so the history of restaurants
more or less doesn't include DC.
Like when we think of the great American
restaurants, they happen sort of in LA
or they happen in New York.
And so you think about like spas ago
in the 80s, I guess,
and what people talk about
when they talk about
Spago is like, this actor was there,
that actor was there, whatever.
And then when you talk
about the great restaurants of New York,
you talk about this, model eight there,
this actor right there, this baked person
eight there, this like important person
eight there.
And so in DC, the version of that
now that sort of politics or pop
culture is like what politicians
are eating at these restaurants
and that sort of becomes
what you're known for.
And so early on, we were on the hill.
And so we developed a following
among the new administration
that came in like two months
after we opened.
And so now it is a Maga restaurant,
because that's like an interesting way
to talk about the restaurant.
Because they're there.
And so it's just like you're, you're,
you're notability is like,
who's in the dining room?
And so early on, we had a lot of customers
from the administration
from like Scott Batson to Marco Rubio,
Steve Bannon, whatever it may be.
And so as that sort of developed,
it became the MAGA restaurant.
But like if, if we did what we did it
Butterworth's.
Well, in New York, it would be like the
I don't know if we did it
somewhere near Wall Street
would be like the Wall Street restaurant.
So I, I'm not like it'd be like, you know.
Just one quick thing.
Follow up.
When anyone launches
an establishment in DC,
do they have to sort of
think about this question of sort of
which side is which side will be aligned
with this restaurant
in terms of like the market opportunity?
No, it's relatively new.
It was it was a it was a binary
sort of in the 70s, 80s, 90s
of like you, you had political customers
or you didn't.
Right.
So there was a very famous, restaurant
in, in, in downtown DC in the 70s
called Sanssouci.
It was like this French restaurant
and the entire administration,
all the administrations with their,
you know, all these things,
and Mick Jagger showed up one day and
he wasn't wearing a proper sports coat,
so they kicked him out.
But it was a political place, like you had
to look like you sort of belonged there.
And so there was there was political
restaurants or nonpolitical restaurants,
and it was
it was a lot about proximity and how close
you are to these various buildings.
But but this like,
declaring everything
sort of right or left is very new.
In an odd.
I want to go back to something you said.
I'm kind of surprised that
Washington, D.C.
didn't develop more of a food scene,
given that, you know, I think about it
as a political city, for obvious reasons.
A lot of politics is about,
you know, being seen
with the right people
and, appearing important.
And so it's kind of surprising to me
that it didn't develop more of these,
like, seen and be seen restaurants.
Yeah.
I it's it's strange
when we, when we started the place
this was sort of explicitly
an aim like the dining room is designed
to not hide anyone. Right.
Like you will be seen in BC and like
there's no, there's no hiding place.
That was a big part of the business model
because I was looking at Spago
and a couple other places
in New York from the 80s
and thinking through that process.
I think
maybe the answer to DC is
like it was more of a house party thing.
And there's always been
sort of like the gentlemen's clubs
and the private clubs
and like the Georgetown scene was a
you bring in a chef and do a party
at your house like there was.
It was always like behind closed doors.
It's a very like the smoke filled room
thing exists for a reason, right?
Like DC is a town that likes to hide
itself.
Yeah.
It is interesting to think
like you read stories about DC
and all the legendary things
that would be like,
you know, some some editor at the
Washington Post or something like that
were famous for their cocktail parties
and everyone was there.
So it is true.
It does feel like the places
where people congregated
did tend to be
these more like private entities.
Just one more question.
No, it is not quite true that it's like,
oh, you opened the restaurant
before the new administration
and they started,
I mean, you're one of your co-owners.
I think there's like, affiliated
with Breitbart UK.
I mean, there are Butterworth.
Yeah, named after him.
There are there are political routes
to the restaurant.
Right. Totally.
I mean, this this is part of being in DC.
We have six investors, I think two
the third one, I would have to ask
because he's like a tech bro.
So you never know where they align.
But two of them are pretty solidly
like classic libs.
And a few of them are pretty,
pretty like MAGA adjacent conservatives.
I will say the one you're talking about,
Raheem Kassam,
he used to work with Steve Bannon,
was the Breitbart editor in London.
He's done
a lot of work with the administration.
One of our investors,
when we started, when we opened the place,
you sort of invite all your friends
and family, and that's how you sort of
get the business going.
And it turns out he was just way
better at it than the rest of us.
Right.
So, like the first night we were open,
there's like 60 reservations
and I'm pretty sure
like 45 of them were from Rahim.
And so the MAGA thing
did sort of generate in that way.
How difficult
is it to get investors for a restaurant
business in general,
but also specifically in DC?
Yeah.
It's like it's a terrible investment,
right?
Like if you're if you're listening to this
for financial advice, don't do it.
Yeah. They say never open a restaurant.
And I imagine they also say
never invest in a restaurant.
Right.
So if you're if you're looking
to make money off an investment,
never invest in a restaurant.
If you're looking to sort of build
for yourself a,
a place to be
to always have the good table,
to invite your friends, to have something
to talk about at dinner parties.
It's one of the best investments, right?
Like there's
nothing more interesting than sort of
like what's going on
and there's nothing more convenient
than, like,
not having to host at your own house
and to be able to say, oh, like,
come to my restaurant, sit at my table.
That part of it's great.
But as a, as a business investment, it's
like the worst, especially post-Covid.
Like the margins are joke.
Let's talk about the menu. We I mean,
the whole team came.
Everyone loved the meal.
Like, how do you go about the process of
sort of conceptualizing the overall menu?
A goal for the menu?
Yeah.
So our specifically
is working with farmers.
So I have a host of farmers
that I've been working with as a chef for
I guess, a decade now.
And most of them are the, the sort of
Pennsylvania Amish and Mennonites.
So, you know, the sort of
not technologically plugged in folks.
And so it's
I get a call from them on Mondays,
like, go, this is sort of
what's coming out of the ground this week.
These are
which animals are being slaughtered?
Which ones do you want?
And then those products come in and the
menu is based off of that, which sort of,
doesn't really allow
you to have the same dish on the menu
every single day,
which is a classic sort of trope
of the restaurant industry,
if you're like in culinary school
or whatever, they'll sort of say, like,
consistency is super important.
You should have the same dish
prepared the same way every time,
because if it becomes somebody's favorite
and they can't come
get it next week, they'll be super mad
and they'll stop being a customer.
But what that does is sort of create
a sort of leans
into a global supply chain where
you, like, you have to have, bananas.
Every single,
day if you have a Bananas Foster.
But like,
bananas are not growing year round
unless you're willing to sort of
go across the globe
and then you're dealing with shipping
and the product's not as fresh.
And in all of these sort of problems.
So what we do is
we work with these farmers,
and whatever's coming out of the ground
at that time is what we're doing.
And so in the summer
when there's a ton of tomatoes, we're
getting all the tomatoes in what we can
and what we're not selling,
using were canning to make tomato sauce
in the winter when there's no tomatoes.
Like, that's a really sort of good way
to work around
not having produce in the winter.
But other than that, we're sort of,
obligated to
and constrained by what's actually
coming out of the ground at that time.
Is it true that you don't serve burgers
because you don't want everyone
to just go into the restaurant and order
a burger all the time?
The the burger conundrum
is, is, conundrum?
I love the burger conundrum is the
is the bane of my existence.
So, I had a restaurant three blocks
from Butterworths years ago called Buca.
It's it was it was a lot
like Butterworth's, but smaller.
And we did a burger because that was,
you know, it's good money at the time.
And it quickly became like one of those
like, oh, this is the best burger in DC.
Really popular burger.
And so then you do this, like
really interesting dish with pheasant or,
you know, whatever.
And you work really hard on it
and you're so excited you can't wait.
People try it and then you sell 30 burgers
at a night and then you're done.
And so the problem with the burger is not
that it's it's bad economics
or that it's a bad dish.
I love burgers as much as anyone.
The problem is, if you do it
well, it's it's the only thing you become
capable of selling.
Because it's so
self-explanatory
and it's it's so desirable.
And so if you want to sort of work
with all these products,
if you want to be able to,
like, sort of sell bone marrow
or you won't be able
to sell these game birds,
or you won't be able to sell this weird
vegetable, you can't have a burger
because it just dominates the entire menu.
This actually reminds me
of the podcast industry, right?
Because often
like some of our best episodes,
I would argue some of our episodes
that get the best feedback
come in lower
in terms of downloads than some that I.
I am not such a fan of.
No, this is really interesting.
I had never thought about this.
If you have any I guess signature item,
it has this crowding out.
In fact, the moment
you have a great burger
and it gets on the bus,
it's like, oh, we all or got to order
the best burger in DC because we're here,
then what is the point of invest?
I had never thought about this phenomenon,
the curse of the curse of the burger,
but I was like, okay, what?
Hey, what about all this other great,
stuff that we have talked to us about?
The audience capture for ground beef.
The, the, the supply chain.
How did okay, so you talked to the farmers
in Pennsylvania, etc..
How does it get there?
What are the who are the entities that,
sort of that actually deliver the food?
And how built out is that,
who are these companies and so forth
that actually make
this distribution happen.
So I'm a psycho
and I try to avoid the like quote unquote
larger supply chain at all costs.
So the, the,
the actual way that the produce
and most of the meat gets to
the restaurant is a as a literal Amish,
Amish guy with like a hat in the beard
and everything shows up at seven.
He's like one of the few people that has
the key box code to the restaurant.
Because he refuses to be in
DC during the day
because there's too much traffic
and it's too loud. He enough.
So he
comes in early, comes to the restaurant,
drops it all off, we shop.
It's there.
For a lot of restaurants,
it is sort of Cisco
and a couple other really large companies
that are that are doing this procurement.
And then a huge tractor trailer shows up.
And these are sort of commoditized
and like,
they're pretty standard
across the industry.
But if you
if you want to break out of that, you're
dealing with like a guy
with a Ford F-150 in the, in a trailer.
I know you said you had these farmer
relationships
from your previous experience
as a restaurant owner,
but how do you actually go about finding
and identifying potential suppliers,
especially in the Amish and Mennonite
community?
Because, you know,
I imagine they're not necessarily
posting ads online or something like that.
No, they have a land line
that they're only allowed to use in the
barn for one of them.
So in the earlier
days, now, now that that
there's sort of an economy for this,
because the farm to table thing happened.
But in the early days before, before
that was sort of an industry of it
in and of itself.
The trick was
you would go to farmers markets, like
actually the same one that you would go to
on a Saturday morning or whatever.
And you would talk to the farmer
and you would sort of
say like, hey,
these carrots are really good.
I have a restaurant.
I want to buy 80 pounds of them
every week.
Can I get your contact information
or whatever it may be?
And then for a lot of those,
if you see your favorite farm
stall at the market on Saturdays
disappear, it's because of enough of us
are buying their stuff
to where they don't
have to deal with that. Right.
It's my fault.
No, the
so for sure.
You know, I,
you know I there's farmers markets
in my neighborhood in the East Village.
I love going to a farmer's market.
Actually,
I, I never really thought about farmer's
market economics before, but
how much are farmers markets in general
about the revenue that they make there
versus
like building some of these connections
such that they have more,
you know, a place to be seen
by potentially commercial clients?
Yeah, you should definitely,
you know, next time you're there, ask,
but my understanding
is that if you're at the farmers
market, you're sort of
at the beginning of your cycle
as a new company,
a new enterprise or the end.
And so I, you know, there was a farmer
that I bought from from a long time,
who did pigs
up in Illinois, and now I'm working
with a closer distributor in Virginia.
But the last time I saw him,
he was at the farmers market.
And he was like, yeah, yeah,
this is the only outlet
I have to sell things anymore. Like,
we're all the way out.
We're like,
we're done. We're closing up shop.
We're selling the farm.
And so, you know, that's sort of the
the cycle is either
they're trying to build an audience
so that they can do this wholesale process
or they're, they're sort of like,
this is their last leg
because it's not a great economic model,
like being in a farmers market is, is,
it's like small potatoes for them.
I know you said that, the ingredients
and the menu construction
was influenced by seasonality.
So what's in season at any given time?
But how much does price
actually influence your decisions?
So, you know, if a farmer comes in
and says, I have trying to think
of an inexpensive thing for Gras,
I have the best gras in the world
or something like that,
but it's really, really expensive.
Would you still buy it?
Do your customers care about price?
Oh, boy.
They do.
No, no they do.
I I've been thinking about this a lot,
so I was I was,
you know, it's the end of the year.
So I'm doing numbers and all those things
you have to do when you have investors.
And I was looking at the price of French
fries specifically,
and we've been noted for the French fries
and the beef Tyler fries and the
best fries in D.C. and whatever.
And I think they're on the menu right now
for 12 bucks an order.
And I was looking at an old menu of mine
from restaurant, you know, in 2019,
and they were all the same fries.
I've been making the same fries forever.
They were on the menu
for nine bucks an order,
and I was like, wow,
you know, really gone up.
12 bucks is kind of expensive
for an order of fries.
Like, is there any room for this?
And I started sort of digging
into the price of goods
and the labor involved
and realized that, like,
if I one of the same sort of margins
on that $9 order of fries
that I have on my now $12 order fries,
they would actually be 25 bucks.
Wow. So like, we've just sort of like the
the cost of goods is like eviscerated
sort of the margins on that.
And we found other ways to make it up.
In different areas of the menu
or with private events or whatever,
catering, whatever it may be.
But, but
chefs are not inclined
to at least like the chefs
that are in the kitchen every day
are not inclined to think
about the price of goods
because they want the best product.
Like they'll sort of go
they'll sort of stretch their own margins
to get the better product.
If you're if you're eating at a restaurant
where, like, the chef, like the chef is
named on something, you're getting the
the best product, no matter what it cost,
because we're just psychotic
and obsessive in that way.
Because we, you know, they tend to be
more artists than like, economists, right?
So they, they,
they want the thing to taste
as good as they can,
specifically because other chefs
are going to come in and eat
and be like, this is this is that doodoo
foie gras from Sysco or whatever,
but why are you serving that?
And it's really embarrassing for.
But do
you have specials at the restaurant.
No, because we change the menu every day.
So the special place
is sort of like designed to allow you
to keep the same menu year round
and then like do
the seasonal thing on the weekends.
Or is it.
Just but, well, maybe you could just
there's just a general question.
I think, like everyone who read that
Kitchen Confidential became really like
cynical about specials is like,
oh, this is this is just
how the chef gets rid of the fish
that's about to go bad or whatever.
Can you clear up some misconceptions
are like, how real is that?
I don't know that that book made me.
I read it in high school.
You know, a high schooler loves a book
like that, but like, or maybe early
college, but, like, it makes you
very cynical about a lot of decisions.
And this comes out and it's like,
oh, this is
this is just a plate of like,
tomatoes with vinegar.
And they called it something fancy.
Like, how real is that phenomenon?
Yeah.
So two things.
Number one, in his second book,
he totally,
Anthony and his second book,
Medium Raw, I think it was called
he totally regrets writing that essay.
Oh, he's like, this has been detrimental
to the restaurant industry.
I was idiot, I was really mad.
I'm sorry I wrote that.
It's not true.
So the funny thing about Anthony Bourdain,
and this is this is,
he wasn't like, a good chef.
He was like a very normal
run of the mill chef.
He was a great writer,
a really good media personality.
But, like, he, like,
if he lived in Columbus, like he would be
the chef of an Applebee's. Like,
it was a very like.
Like the medium, the road, like a workman.
Like he was a he was a he was a workman.
God, that's going to get clipped.
I'm going to look like a jerk.
But like, he, you know, he, he,
and he would say that himself, like,
he wasn't like a grand sort of haute
chef or whatever he was.
He was a workman.
He was a he was a journeyman.
And so that is true at that level.
It's totally true.
And all of it's still true to this day.
Like, if the fish is starting
to go bad on Friday
and you're one of those restaurants,
they are going to toss it
in some vinaigrette
and put it on a salad on the French menu.
That's 100% going to happen.
But the Bart,
since that essay was written in the 90s,
or I think it was the 90s,
the bar for chefs.
And because of the whole foodie
revolution of the mid odds,
the, the, the lowest level of like chef
is much higher than it was then.
Like, there's not
there's fewer and fewer journeymen.
And there's
more and more people who are into it
because they're like obsessive
about the products and sort
of artistically minded in that regard.
So if you're eating at a restaurant
that's not a train,
you know,
I wouldn't worry too much about that stuff
because they okay, if anything,
they're more inclined to throw it out
before you would even notice,
because they're just sort of like,
they would be ashamed if they sold
a piece of fish that smelled bad.
Yeah.
In defense of Anthony Bourdain's
cooking ability,
his cookbook is really good,
and he has an awesome recipe for lasagna.
And then a whole, like, schedule
for doing Thanksgiving dinner.
And I follow those religiously.
Although I will admit there, you know,
they're basic recipes in some sense.
They're not particularly creative, but
they're great, and I rely on them anyway.
You know, you mentioned the importance
of chefs, in a restaurant like this.
How competitive are restaurants
when it comes to getting the best chef?
Extremely.
It's like,
when we were opening,
when we were opening, butter was
I would go stand out back of restaurants
that I liked,
where the, the sort of dumpsters were
where people might take smoke breaks
in hopes that I could talk to the cooks
and steal them.
So we, we trade talent,
and sort of fight over talent.
An extremely competitive way.
So much so that, there's, like, serious
feuds over it across cities,
like in New York, DC, in LA,
there are chefs who hate each other
because they steal each other's cooks,
particularly if you have like,
a really good, fast dishwasher and I can
have one dishwasher instead of two,
I'm going to take your dishwasher. Wow.
Can I ask you?
So the night that we were there,
I after I tweeted we were there
and I think maybe you sent
maybe it was via DM and you're like,
oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Said something like,
I'm glad you enjoyed the meal.
I think we had sort of an off night
or something like that.
What does that mean, like an off night
or from the perspective of the chef?
Because it certainly seemed
like a very busy night, etc..
Our food was excellent.
In your mind when you say, you know what,
we kind of had an off night.
What does that mean to you?
It can mean a few things that night.
Specifically, it meant,
the it was very busy that night,
but the busyness was not spread out.
It wasn't like, oh, there's a table
at 615, the another table at 630,
the noble table, it was every single table
came in at the exact same time.
And so
what happens then is all your production
lines get screwed at the exact same time.
So then there's a huge wave of cocktails
in the bartenders
rushing through all the cocktails,
because all the cocktail orders
came in at the same time.
And then it moved to the kitchen,
and the kitchen's rushing
through all the orders
because they all came in at the same time,
instead of sort of
like being super purposeful and like,
okay, I have ten minutes to do this one,
and then the next one's going to come in
and then the next one's going to come
and they all come in at the same time.
So you're rushing through it.
And as a result, like things get sloppy.
And so that night specifically,
I watched the rhythm of the restaurant
and everyone came in
at the exact same time,
and I could see the kitchen
getting backed up
and tickets were a little slower
than I would like them to be.
And some of the plates, like,
I was like, oh,
I wish we had plated that
a little bit differently.
I wish it was a little neater here.
And so when that happens, reservation
systems are mostly designed to do that.
Some of them are designed to fit as many
people in as they can and good for them.
But most reservation systems
are designed to slow down
the number of people who are coming in
so that the dishes and the drinks
and whatever it may be, are done well
and done intentionally.
And when
there's like a huge swath of walk
ins on any given night, that's when the,
that's when the sort of like,
the production capacities of a kitchen
or a bar get sort of backlogged
and they get sloppy.
Treated,
sort of reminds me a little bit of like,
our, our conversations that we talk about
electricity and grid,
which is the difference between total
throughput and peak throughput.
Right.
And so, you know,
you want an even distribution.
And the problems come on that one
really hot day or whatever.
And so yeah, spreading it out, spreading
the demand out
is also a very important consideration
in sort of optimal grid design.
Only you would compare
the restaurant business
to electricity grids,
but it makes sense I agree.
Since
since we're on the topic of reservations,
one phenomenon of living in a foodie city
is that you have restaurants
where it's very difficult
to get a reservation.
And I'm thinking specifically of carbon.
I would love to take my husband to carbon
one day, but my impression of the process
to get space there is like it's
so difficult, it's basically not worth it.
And in fact, in New York,
you know how reservation auctions, people
selling well, platforms.
There's one thing you know, there are
these one, I forget which app is where
you can get a reservation fairly easily
if you pre-commit to a minimum spend.
So it's like you can pre-commit
to like a $300 spend or.
Whatever, $300 worth of.
Garlic and then and then anyway.
So first of all,
how do I get a reservation at carbon?
What are your tips?
And then secondly, what do restaurants
think of these
like very intense competitions
for seating in the restaurant.
Yeah.
Number one,
this is mostly David Chang's fault,
so I hope I hope he knows this is entirely
his fault.
Momofuku Ko was this,
he's, like, sort of Michelin
starred restaurant, like, it's closed now.
But it was the first one that I.
That I knew of
at the time that that did this, like,
there's no way around the reservation
system, like, you have to log on
exactly two weeks before,
and you have to sort of win the lottery.
There's this famous story
about how his parents
couldn't
get a reservation for the first year
because he refused to sort of
break out of the system.
And so used to you would like,
know somebody and you would shake hands
and you would sort of get a reservation
and whatever, in this like super,
scarcity model sort of
produced this, like this, this reservation
thing to some extent.
So how do you get a reservation?
A lot of them are now designed
to not have any workarounds.
Right.
So, like knowing
somebody is not going to help you.
Because if you, if you interfere with that
scarcity model, you,
you interfere with the entire system.
And so and so your best, your best luck
is to sort of be online at the right time
when they go live.
Some reservations, book a month out,
some book a whole year out, some book
one week out.
So understanding
exactly where you are in that process
and when those dates unlock is,
is sort of where you want to be.
Most of these systems are sort of
automatically ran by OpenTable or Rizzi.
And so they're pretty standardized.
A lot of them are midnight.
I think Rosie's midnight.
And I think open table's like 2 a.m.,
so understanding that might be helpful.
Other than that, there's just like,
not a lot of ways around it anymore
because of the sort of scarcity model
that we have to maintain.
That being said,
knowing the owner would help.
So go meet the Tracy
brothers, have them on the podcast,
and then see
if they can get your reservation.
That might that might do it.
There's nice. Very ethical. Yeah.
You mentioned David.
I just remembered, some friends of mine
back when David Chang had, his food
magazine.
Like, I remember that
it closed down in love, like, 2017, but,
they used to do
dramatic readings of, like, sit there
and, you know, someone would read it out
loud in a really dramatic fashion.
And it was hilarious. It was so much fun.
I need to do that again.
I think that sounds very fun.
I. Love Lucky Peter.
I still have, every issue.
Oh, really? Like.
Oh, yeah. I was like.
Those are probably about like.
You know what they might be.
Actually. Those were the good old days.
We didn't do Lucky Beach.
I want to talk a little bit
about more about the labor market.
So you talked about the intense
competition for chefs, but also,
you know, there's the competition
for a really high skilled dishwasher.
I kind of like a two part question,
which is like, right now
we're recording this December 17th, like a
how does the competition
for sort of maybe, you know, the not,
you know, the sort of more everyday
restaurant labor, like,
what does it look like?
And I'm also curious,
you know, restaurant kitchens,
I suspect, are sort of disproportionately
draw from the immigrant workforce,
perhaps probably in many restaurants,
a lot of undocumented immigrants.
I'm curious
if you see any effect from that.
And just to the extent
that there is a restaurant ideology
or that, you know, and I associate,
obviously a sort of the crackdown
on immigration and or the reversal
of, of restraint, unrestrained
immigration is part of the signature moves
of the current political environment.
Can you talk a little bit
about how this all looks
from the perspective
of someone who has to staff a restaurant?
Yeah.
I mean, there's an arms
race to some extent, right?
Which is like traditionally the restaurant
industry has drawn from this.
Undocumented labor market.
And, and that there's obviously
less, less
and less of those each day right now.
For a multitude of political reasons.
And so the, the,
the good restaurant workers that are left,
are becoming incredibly scarce.
And so there's, there's huge
incentives to if,
if somebody if your dishwasher comes and
asks for a raise, you just give it to them
because you're finding another one, like
training, you know, training a new person
who's never done it before or whatever
it may be, it's going to take you months.
In the cost
will just work out to be exactly
the same as giving
the one you have a raise.
And so the the market on cooks is, is,
you know, sort of when I started out the,
the cook and dishwasher
sort of level of the, of the staffing,
not the management level, but below that,
was the average was like sort of 2 or
$3 above the minimum wage.
And now it's like at least.
It's close to double now, right.
Like so
the DC minimum wage is creeping up to 15.
And I think our average cooks
and dishwashers are like 26, 27 an hour.
And so
and so that market is becoming incredibly
it's becoming harder and harder to staff,
because we, you know,
there was decades of sort of training
this undocumented community
on how to do these tasks.
And now
all of that sort of like human capacity,
all of that training has been pushed out.
And so for the ones who are documented,
the ones who stayed or whatever it may be,
their, their prices
and their value are skyrocketing
because it's because there's just less
and less of them.
And that that time that was spent
training, whether it was that sort of at,
at Applebee's or a restaurant
like mine or whatever it may be,
those years and years of of training,
are becoming harder and harder to find.
You can't just, like, replace that
in six months, like you can't teach.
I can't
with with a dishwasher,
maybe with with cook.
I can't take a guy who works at,
you know, Dunkin Donuts or whatever
and train him
to be like a French line
cook in less than a year.
It's going to take a long time to get him
sort of to where he can do things
to order and be useful.
And so there's a lot of just training
that's gone.
And it's been great for the wages
of the people who are still here.
But it is
it is really competitive right now.
One notable thing about Butterworth's
is it's an a really cool building.
Yeah, a historic building.
And the decor is really nice.
Joe knows that I'm into interior
decorating.
So, you know,
you've got the antler chandeliers
and the sort of plush seats
and all of that.
How important is the, I guess, the vibe
of the restaurant to the overall business?
Massively important. Right?
Like, the, the
I think these days I spent as much time
thinking about lighting and volume level
and like,
spacing out of seats and,
and and whether or not you can hear
the person you're talking to
and that stuff, as I do about the food.
Because again, this, this
there's this sort of arc
that started in the food thing
sort of started in 2008,
with the with the housing crisis
in the real estate bubble.
And so all of a sudden,
all of these young, ambitious chefs
could afford to go open a restaurant, and,
and they hired cooks beneath them.
And they trained those cooks.
So we got a sort of a wealth of good cooks
and good people
that went on to be chefs.
And so that foodie thing
that we saw in the mid aughts,
produced a ton of
really good food, like,
we are better off because of it.
And, but now sort of real estate and,
and those things are back to
where they were in that way, before that.
And so now your competitive advantage
isn't just that your food's good,
because good food is easier
and easier to come by like you can
you can find a good chef
in any neighborhood,
but you're
but you need a competitive advantage
because rents are sort of back
to where they were or whatever.
They're very,
incredibly expensive right now.
And so you're, oh,
we have the best food in town.
Like, doesn't
work, doesn't work anymore. Right?
So, like,
you have to combine the best food
with a comfortable place to hang out
or with a specific social scene
or with a whatever it may be.
You mentioned lighting.
How much of that?
When you think about lighting,
how much is it about the experience
of the diners that night
versus lighting for Instagram ability
or TikTok or whatever it is?
And how do you think about the fact
that part of eating is creating
social content, and how does that
factor into your strategy
and thinking about the overall vibe?
So I think a lot about it.
And you saw this again
with that sort of like the foodie thing.
Yeah,
the restaurants were incredibly bright,
and the Scandinavian minimalism thing
was, a trend at the time,
but also lent itself to Instagram
and like posting and taking pictures.
I really do. I can't stand it.
But it
lent itself to sort of photography and,
and those sort of things incredibly
well because you had these bright, natural
light restaurants
and you could sort of photograph
something top down in a way, and
it would look really good on Instagram.
And so to say, I don't think about it,
I don't want to be a part of
that is not true,
because what I'm actually trying to do
is the exact opposite,
which is like our food photographs,
terribly.
If you have photos on your phone
from that night, they probably look awful.
But it's this it's a reaction
to that thing which is like,
I want to feel like something
sort of before that
date or something sort of more classic
or more timeless than that.
The the rule of thumb, I work for this,
this great,
really good restaurateur,
named Brennan, who's down in Florida now.
So if you're ever in Destin and you find
a good restaurant, he probably owns it.
But his rule of thumb was, like,
if it's if it's too bright to reasonably
get away with giving a handjob, that it's
too bright and the restaurant is.
It's. Not what I, say. But.
And if you. Train thumb, it's good too.
But if you if you tell that to your staff,
they never forget.
Like you'll never come into butter
where it'll be too bright
because they won't forget that one.
Thank you for changing
my restaurant experience forever.
There's a really good breakfast place
in Connecticut that I like to go to.
The food's amazing.
The service is excellent,
but the decor is terrible.
It's like gray vinyl flooring
and just white walls.
And every time I'm in there, I'm
like, well, they should let me redecorate.
I would do it for free
just to enjoy it a bit more.
It treats it.
You know how much I loathe
the degree to which the built environment
has been designed for?
Like you've heard me like rant
about millennial pink and all of these,
all of these design cliches,
I know, but these design elements
that are just so clearly designed
to be a backdrop for someone's Instagram
and the way our whole real life has been
reorient did for photography,
for social photography drives me crazy,
and I do appreciate any anything
that just like this looks like the pre
iPhone era, you know what I'm saying?
Absolutely.
One thing I
wanted to ask is, you know,
we talked about the clientele earlier and,
you know, you got some well known
people into the restaurant.
Do you try to, I'm trying to think, like,
directly publicize that or like,
monetize that.
If Steve Bannon comes in
for the first time, what do you do?
So it's it's actually the exact opposite.
And, on some level,
I'm grateful that the media
at large has done this for us
because it's as a restaurant tour.
It's like really embarrassing to do that.
And so my big fear
is if you have a major client,
you know, Nancy Pelosi was like a regular
one of my older restaurants.
The big fear is
if the people find out there they are,
they'll start coming to interrupt
her in the middle of dinner.
And then that person's gone.
And I've watched it happen
with restaurants over and over again.
And that that can range from,
like a famous person to,
you know, if you're if your bar gets known
for having, like, pretty women
at the bar, like, all of a sudden
it's like 70% male and the pretty woman,
like, this is, this is this is like
a reality of this thing, right?
Which is like, they're there
because, nobody's bothering them there,
and they get to be normal
and sort of human.
And so in some ways, it's
been an incredible thing for us
that the, the,
the sort of media has picked up on this
and they're, they're happy to,
to sort of write about it because it does
bring in new customers
who are looking for that specific thing.
But at the same time, you're always afraid
of losing those customers.
So for me specifically, I would never,
ever, in a million years be like,
hey, Politico,
by the way, like in the spotted,
you know, Marco Rubio having dinner
with his family, because then you'll
just never see that customer again.
And that's that's a
that's a terrible thing to do to somebody.
It's funny you said, Mark, I literally
just going to use Marco in my example.
The question I was going to ask.
So you're there in the show
if someone says, well, by the way,
Marco Rubio's in the dining room tonight,
don't do anything different.
So at that point, it's the same thing
with the food critic.
At that point, it's
too late to do anything different.
So, so much of cooking and so much of,
of preparing food for a restaurant happens
before the first diner sits down, right?
Like if you're braising something,
you take, you know, the four hours
it takes to braise that thing
and then the service starts
and you're you're basically
just sort of heating up at that point.
So there's not a lot
you can do on the food level,
but there is the sort of
like minor details
around the, around the edges,
which is like, okay,
the plate is going
to be a little bit cleaner.
You know,
you're going to let the server know.
So one of the funniest ones is we had,
the ambassador from the UK and early
on, and I didn't know who he was.
And so I said I was like,
hey, what's up, man?
All the,
all the British people were like, well,
you're supposed to say whatever the title.
I don't even remember at this point
because I don't care.
But, you know, I use the wrong greetings
and there's a whole proper
greeting etiquette
that I just didn't know.
And so you do sort of try
to let the servers in in the,
in the front of house
know that sort of thing
because it's just embarrassing for them
if you don't.
You mentioned pretty women at the bar.
So now I have to ask,
I imagine running a restaurant,
you see some interesting things go down
and you probably hear
a lot of interesting conversations.
What's the most dramatic incident or,
intriguing conversation that you've seen?
What's what's this is so funny.
So the, the sort of political era we're in
now where it let's seems to be
all anyone talks about.
Isn't is incredibly,
boring to me.
So there's a lot of, like,
there's a lot of sort of like
political arguments
or dealmaking that happens,
at the restaurants in DC.
Whereas like
sort of this pre
this era, I had a nightclub, restaurant,
lounge thing in Adams Morgan
where like semi-regularly,
a sort of a male,
this one I'm specifically thinking
about this,
woman came in with her.
She was in a relationship,
and she was having an affair.
And so she came in with her
affair partner and was seated next
to a guy who was also having an affair,
which was her partner.
And so they were
seated right next to each,
and had to, like, we had to
find the bouncers and sort of drag
all of those people out,
because the sort of arguments
and the yelling at each other started,
was, was just over the top and ridiculous.
I don't know, I feel like maybe
that would be a good way to discover that.
It's like, okay, let's just call it a wash
here or, or.
Even a we're both guilty.
We're both guilty.
All right, I have I actually have
like a million more questions.
I'm mindful of the time I have one last
just sort of like
maybe an important macroeconomic question.
So what awards
hasn't been opened that long?
But you've been in the business
for a long time.
And one of the things that we talk about
a lot is, you know,
in the 2021, 2022 era,
one of the phenomenons of that time was,
for the first time in
maybe many people's lives,
they were a small business owner.
It may have been the first time
that you couldn't
just put a sign in the window saying
help, wanted and expect
a lot of people to shop.
It was an era of labor scarcity,
the likes of which we hadn't seen in
decades, and maybe people had never had
to contemplate that possibility before.
And the question we've been wrestling with
and asking a lot of people is like,
what are the sort of scars
from that period,
the traumas of that period,
and how did they carry over?
Did you has your experience of that time,
of realizing that you could wake up
and might literally not be able to
perhaps staff a restaurant that day
so that you can function?
Has it stayed with you to now
in such a way that you think strategically
different about things like optimal
staffing levels or optimal inventory
or anything like that?
Did it change the way you do business
into some sort of lasting way?
Yeah, in a ton of ways.
I'm not even sure which one to start with.
So so number one,
I have if you
if you came to the restaurant tonight
and you went into the kitchen,
it's the exact same people that worked
would be the day Covid started.
And so I've kept, kept them in
various ways through multiple restaurants.
Because I watched all
my other friends
sort of lose cooks and dishwashers
and whatever, during that time
and not be able to get them back.
And so they're like, a chef designs a dish
and maybe even does a bunch of the prep,
but at the end of the day,
you're still putting up
the hands of your staff to do it, do it,
do it right when, when an order comes in.
And I saw that the, the wholesale quality
of their food plummet
because they all of a sudden they were
handing it to people they didn't train.
And so through a number of reasons, got
really lucky, kept a lot of those people.
And I will keep them
as long as I possibly can.
Because to train a new generation
of after them myself would just.
I mean, I'm
almost too late in my career to do it.
And so that's, that's a big thing.
We did see a huge exit of like, management
level staff during that time.
So if you're a really good front of house
staff or if you're a really good waiter
or a really good manager,
a really good bartender,
it turns out you're also a great salesman.
So a lot of money into real estate and
and sales and whatever it may be.
And so there is
if you're at restaurants now
and you're like,
why is service so bad, number one?
They're understaffed
because labor has become so expensive
that they're trying to get more tables
out of one server.
Number two, the people that they spent
training to do those front of house jobs
exited that entire economy during Covid
because we were I mean, we were sort of
frontlines of this thing happening.
We were expected to be open every day,
but without any staff or money to do it
with, and so and so a lot of like the best
Somalia's the best front of house managers
totally exit the market.
So those are still hard to find.
And we struggle with it all the time.
I've got a good friend,
a house manager right now.
I'm really lucky, but it took us.
But he's our third one and one year
because they're just really hard to find.
The talent pool for that is,
is, is is really empty right now.
And then
the cost of goods is just never recovered.
And so sort of like,
you know, when it started,
we were like, oh, you know,
supply chains are bad right now
because of shipping or whatever it may be.
And, they'll, they'll go back down on,
you know, whatever it was, fryer oil.
This is a big part of the beef
tallow thing.
With the fries
is I buy the cows from this farmer.
So I also get a good price on his tallow,
because I sort of buy the whole thing.
But most fryers in, you know,
in any restaurant in the entire world,
are filled with canola oils that are
that are sort of globally processed.
Right?
And so during Covid,
you saw all these things go up in price
and you were told
they were going to come down and,
it's shipping containers,
whatever it may be.
They never they never came down.
It cost an unbelievable.
It's like 200 bucks a night
to fill a fryer or something like that.
And so we
that's when I sort of started
the switch to beef tallow
and all that because I was like,
okay, well, I know this guy.
He's 30 miles away or whatever.
I'm going to just buy his entire product
and keep the supply chain like 1 to 1.
So there's this is all kinds of,
of, of things that happened to Covid
that we're still recovering from.
But the big ones are the staffing
and the consumer. There's obviously.
Vertical integration.
There's one more macro.
Yeah. One more macro question
that we got to ask.
We talked about the supply side,
but what are you seeing on
the demand side in terms of customers
coming in and ordering.
And how connected would you say
you are to the broader business cycle?
Because I imagine, you know,
if you're running a McDonald's franchise,
you probably experience
the business cycle in a very different way
to someone
who's running a boutique restaurant.
Yeah.
So my understanding just,
you know, from other restaurant tours
in the news and stuff
is that it's down right now,
and that I think reservations are down
like 15% from last year.
What most people are reporting,
we're in a very special circumstance.
Obviously we're new and we're a
or at the end of the day, a luxury item.
And so, you know, air
mass prices never dropped once and Hermes
demand never dropped once during Covid.
Like this is this is sort of like the
the side of the business that we're in.
We're lucky to be in.
And I hope we can stay in it.
So for us, it's,
it's it's a totally different ballgame.
My understanding
is that the reservations are way down.
Spending is way down.
Across the board.
Yeah. I just have one last question, and,
I'll give you a chance to sort of, like,
really
let your right wing side come out.
Health code violations and permitting
and all that stuff.
Of course, those are some of the most
uncomfortable scenes.
If you watch that show the bear.
How real is it from your perspective?
Do you want to rant a lot about, sort of,
do you want to tell us anything
about permitting and such in DC?
Yeah.
I mean, so number one, the bears
fascinating.
The first season that Uber Eats episode,
I still so all of us
switch to Uber Eats and all of these
things are Covid is about to survive.
And that ding that it makes
when a new order comes in, it
still sends me into like a blackout rage.
I remember one time during Covid
picking up the iPad that the Uber Eats
order came
in, and just throwing it in the deep fryer
and being like,
screw it, I'm not doing this anymore.
And so that episode,
I watched it with my wife, we,
I at one point I was like,
I think we might have to turn this off.
Like, I was getting, like, too, too upset,
too anxious because it was too accurate.
It was totally spot
on. On what that feels like.
With the with the, with the health code
violations
and the
and the permitting and all that stuff.
Oh, God.
Is this where
we're going to have to tell the episode?
And I've been I've been doing
so good of what you have.
I'm trying so hard.
It's ridiculous.
There was a,
a restaurant tour that I worked for, and,
the prep kitchen was in the basement,
and it wasn't ventilated, and I was like,
how how did you get a permit for this?
And he was like, well, we put $10,000
in a briefcase and gave it to the guy.
And that's how we have this, this.
So if you go down to City Hall
and you pull the records for the building,
this basement doesn't even exist.
And this was like less than 12 years ago.
And so
and so
that obviously
doesn't seem like an ideal system,
but to do that
same thing at the restaurant we have now,
took us almost eight months
to get the single permit for that.
And so there's some times
where you're like,
was it better
when we just put some cash in a briefcase?
Like, I'm
not entirely sure what we're doing here.
Because you're paying rent that entire
eight months at that point, you know,
$10,000 a lot cheaper
than, you know, whatever your rent is.
Eight months.
And, yeah, it's a it's a strange thing.
I mean, I'm not sure what sort of like.
Don't say that.
What sort of make work job
it is for the city
to have these health inspectors
that come by
and say the same thing
every single time, which is like,
hey, by the way,
like you're like, they put a thermometer
in all your food, which is hypothetically
for food safety, but, you know,
all the half decent restaurants are fine.
So, like, what are you doing here?
I saw you last month.
They were the right temperature
last month. Can you leave me alone?
But it's really the permitting process
because you're in this race
against your landlord, the open,
before you start paying them. And,
getting 17 different permits to, like,
have a basement or have a closet
or whatever it may be.
Is is is legitimately,
stopping new restaurants from opening.
So it's it's it's it's pretty miserable.
And that's just,
that's not left or right wing.
That's just like,
really like, sort of like a technocrat
would be better in this regard, right?
Like it's like, please
let me get my permit a little bit faster.
Or a mob system.
Right.
Like, my understanding is from
my friends in Montreal
is that it's still very much a mob system.
And so they go, yeah, well,
we still put some cash in a briefcase,
and then, boom, we're open in a month.
So, so, you know, let's pick one of those.
But that's middle ground right now
where like it's just like
three guys in
an office who are completely,
they're going to come like, inspect me
this week for saying this.
It's like there's like
three guys in office
who are all idiots is just is miserable.
Yeah. You're
definitely going to get a yeah, yeah.
That's your problem. Yeah.
I mean. Who cares. Bart Hutchins
That was fantastic.
Thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
Those are a lot of fun. Yeah.
It was good to. Talk to you guys.
Thank you so much. Thanks, guys.
I love restaurant episodes.
I mean, I love restaurants,
but I love restaurant it.
I've just always learned
so much talking to these guys.
We could do like a spinoff series
or something.
Yeah. Know they're incredibly informative.
In terms of the macro
economic environment,
but also all these little themes
that we talk about on Odd Lots
It's like the supply chain,
like labor hoarding, like,
to your point, distribution of resources
such as energy.
No, I agree, I never thought
about that time because obviously
I presume a restaurant wants
all tables filled any given time, right?
But I had never really thought about.
I think you have to have them staggered
so that you do not have
all the cocktail orders come out.
All the same. I never thought about that.
And there's sort of a
risk of like demand spikes.
You have the system design
for some optimal throughput.
And so you but the idea of like
you don't want it all at the same time
very, very intuitive I suppose.
But I just
it hadn't occurred to me before.
Did you watch The Bear. You must have.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I had to stop watching
because it was so stressful
and it was so many people
shouting at each other.
I just
I couldn't do it after the first season.
It's funny how, like, basically
everyone we talked to is like, yep,
it's exactly how it is.
And it's super difficult that
and have you watched The Pit, by the way?
No, but you keep recommending.
That it's good.
There's a new season starting soon, but,
I, you know, I was talking
to a friend of mine who works
at the NYU Medical facilities,
but he had the same reaction.
Like, you can't watch that.
I, as a consumer of TV shows, to my mind,
that's a very good sign.
If people say, no,
I can't watch this, it's too real.
It's like, okay,
I'm not getting something overly dramatic.
Yeah, I'm going to put the pit on my list.
Yeah.
You're sure
this is something that stands out
whenever we do a restaurant episode,
which is there's an intensity
about the job.
And in many ways it's a unique industry
because the profit margins aren't
that big, right?
You're probably doing it for something
other than money.
You're selecting your ingredients
usually, often because you want to make
the best menu item possible.
Not necessarily, again, because it's going
to produce the most profit.
And you basically dedicate
your entire life to this undertaking.
Right? It's also weird to.
Absolutely.
It's interesting to think about, you know,
what is a chef?
You think there's like, oh, this is
someone who makes good food, right?
But then the idea is like that.
The chef then has to think about
lighting the set, all these other things
that do not strictly fall under
what we think of as the making of food.
I don't know, there's so many interesting
things. I mean, the other,
it's so interesting how
many trends seem to date back to 2008.
And so part of the story
there was like, okay,
there's a lot of cheap
rents, restaurants can open up.
But it's also the truth
that media is was such at the time
because of the invention of the iPhone
and so forth, that like foodie culture,
was like a thing in the media.
Right?
And all these, all these different
crosswinds that happen and at certain
key points that made it difficult
to disentangle history.
I don't know,
that was just a really fun episode.
I felt like I learned quite a bit
and I went, oh, and also the the burger.
The burger program was something
I'd never known about.
Yeah, that makes sense again, intuitively.
I gotta say though,
it makes you wonder what comes next.
So like, we've perfected food.
A lot of restaurants
have perfected the vibes
or certainly pay attention to it
more than they used to.
What comes next? Do you think?
I don't know, what do you think I do?
Some thought.
Do you have some?
I mean, I'd like it to be service.
Yeah.
I worry that it's going to be like
some customization thing, which I hate.
Oh, yeah.
We shouldn't give customers options.
I hate that.
I don't like, I don't like,
I don't like choice.
Yeah. That's right, that's right.
Okay. Shall we leave it
there. Let's leave it there.
