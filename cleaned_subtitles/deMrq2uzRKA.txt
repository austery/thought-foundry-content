us growing the initial 10 people on the team, we did crazy recruiting stunts like flying across the world to the person. Oh yeah. Uh after they say no. And then yeah, I think that one of the key challenges facing the company uh in the future and we've faced in the past is we are in a market that's like you know had a iPod moment and like it's going to have an iPhone moment. Please join us in welcoming to the stage Michael Troll, co-founder and CEO of Curser and general partner Martin Cassada.
>> Great to be here.
>> Good morning everyone.
>> Thanks for being here, Michael.
>> H glad to be here. Yeah,
>> appreciate it. He very very rarely does these things I had to beg. So I really appreciate you coming up. No, we didn't miss this. Yeah.
>> Okay. So, uh, as everybody knows, Michael's CEO of Curser. It's one of the, uh, fastest growing companies certainly we've ever seen. Um, it's everywhere. It's crazy. You have to hire, operate through that. So, actually, what I want to do is dig into not the typical kind of founder journey, what brought you here, that there'll be a little bit of that, but like how are you handling the mayhem? Is that cool?
>> Sure. Yeah. No, that sounds great.
>> Okay, great. So, to start to start off with, we'll just do a little bit of history. So, um, I met with a company recently and they came in and they said, "We are the 3D of Cursor." And I said, "Funny story, cuz Kurser was once a 3D company." Is that right?
>> Yes.
>> And so, maybe do you mind talking about kind of a bit of the origin story?
>> Of course. So, uh, there's a bunch of different ways you could actually peg the start date, but, uh, effectively the way the company got started was my co-founders and I, we were close colleagues from school and some other places and we were two moments got us really excited about building a company. Uh, one was trying some of the first useful AI products and in particular trying GitHub copilot, the incumbent in our space. uh and uh the reason this got us excited about starting a company is these products were actually useful and this was the first existence proof of you know AI that you know it's we shouldn't be working on AI in a lab. Uh it's time to actually build systems out in the real world and there's real useful things that you could be doing. Uh the second thing that got us excited was scaling laws too. Uh we got excited about how it seemed like even if the field ran out of ideas the models would get better. And so this was around 2021, beginning of 2022. Um and then uh cursor sort of came out of kind of a whiteboard exercise where we were very excited about a cursor for X for many different spaces. And what does that mean? Uh we thought at the time that there would be for a bunch of different verticals of knowledge work the company that automates uh that area of knowledge work. Uh you know a company for each space and uh that company it would do a couple of things. The first thing it would do is it would build the best product for that space. Uh and it would define what the actual act of that knowledge work looks like as AI matures and gets better. Uh and then with that product, it would win distribution. It would win a big business. Uh and it would get resources like data and capital. And then it would back into being something that looks a little bit more labl like though not a foundation model lab where it would start to use the data uh it gets access to to actually work on the the under underlying models and kind of push the autonomy in the space and then that would then in turn push forward the product and change what the best product looks like. You get this flywheel going. Uh and so we were really really really interested in that and we thought that Microsoft would do that for coding and uh we wanted to work on you know a sleepy uh more or you know less competitive space uh and we had some colleagues who who did mechanical engineering and we were familiar with CAD systems and so there was this uh yeah initial false start of working on uh working on mechanical engineering actually and working on me models to help people be more productive within CAD systems and also building building our own sort of CAD So that was how we got started. It was a bad idea. The founder market fit was horrible. There was this blind man in the elephant problem where we would hop on calls with uh mechis and ask them what they do during their days and we we only we never really had like an intuitive sense for it. I almost wish that in the kind of six seven months where we were working on that we had just gone and been interns at a company uh to really learn the space. But uh eventually eventually we put that idea aside and uh kind of came back to the to the thing that we were really most interested in which is working on programming.
>> So so I've got this theory I don't I don't know I would actually like to hear your views on it on why cursor did so well early on and it's actually pretty benal which is um you know at the time we were surveying the space and there was a lot of companies and they were doing a lot of different things and a lot of it was pretty science fiction like you know we're going to create an agent that will like be a software engineer. We're going to create a model using this new technique. we're going to do all the things. We're going to rewrite the editor, etc. And one of my theories why in early on cursor did well is you were incredibly focused. You chose VS Code. Copilot had matured the market for a few years at the time and it was this narrow focus and just like a way way way better product um that did it. And so two questions. A do you think this is kind of a legit legit view on it? And then the second question is is like h how how did you decide to maintain focus when everybody else was doing everything else because it it was the time to to build the agents or build the model or
>> um yes I definitely think that there's a lot of truth truth to that. I think that also there's an important asterisk in that uh you know the story of this company is still yet to be written and there's so much more to do too.
>> Of course. Yeah. Yeah. No to get to get to this point. I mean like the success to this point I mean there was just such an updraft. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Um yes. So um uh going back to when we were working on the CAD stuff, uh the cold start problem in that space was much harder than in our space where to get started on helping people be more productive and building mech models of uh stuff that they were going to make in the real world. Uh none of the out of the box models were good at that stuff. Uh like there were there was actually like no good 3D representations. You were like open source 3D models that had had transfer. uh if you took the existing textbased LLMs and you tried to get the LLMs to be good at CAD uh they weren't really and so uh much of our time uh spent working on the cat idea in addition to you know calls with mechy's where we didn't really understand what they did in their day job which was obviously a big problem uh it was it was spent doing a lot of modeling work and a lot of data scraping work and we were kind we kind of had PTSD from that when we decided to put it aside and work on programming and so initially yes we were super focused. We were super expedient and we did hack on hack on hack to just get something out into the world as fast as possible uh and start to get some momentum. And part of that was, you know, we didn't have uh you know, we had some funding, but um nothing like the the seed rounds of today. Um and uh and you we had four co-founders and um you know still we talked about hiring expanding the team but uh you know I think we were still really fully learning how to do that and so yes the competitive landscape at the time it was Microsoft it was dozens of startups these startups fit into a bunch of different buckets there were some that were immediately trying to build big foundation models there were some that you know had high fluid product ideas of like very different changes in people's workflows uh and we just tried to get something out as fast as possible. And I remember at the time the like commitment device for us was actually the monthly investor update uh which probably no one read at the time but uh yeah we would it was I think from day one deciding to work on cursor it was a couple weeks to actually have an IDE that we used ourselves and initially we we didn't even fork VS code we actually built from scratch. So we built ID from scratch that we used ourselves as a daily driver. couple more weeks to actually get into other people's hands and then in the span of total I think a couple of months we had launched our first beta uh out to the internet and uh immediately it started to get interest from people uh and then you know that kind of set off the momentum
>> and just I mean just specifically while while the momentum was building a number of the people in the same space were broadening very quickly like they'd go to CLI very quickly or they would like integrate with Intelligj or whatever it was and like you decided not to I mean was it Was this was this like super intentional or was it just you know you're getting pull on the right one like you had enough work to do?
>> Um yeah the ideas were intentional in that uh you know we kind of just worked all the time and so the four co-founders every day it would be breakfast, lunch and dinner. What are you going to talk about? You're going to debate endlessly these core strategic questions of do you build an editor and an extension? Do you do anything on the model side of things? Um and um you know other you know the initial product ideas
>> build a new ID. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Um and yeah I think that we were we were really really intentional about wanting to own the surface. So at the time it's it's not super controversial now but at the time people just thought it was very weird to do an editor whether it was a fork or not a fork. Uh they said you can't get people to to switch their code editor. They're too tied to it. Which we knew was wrong.
>> Um because we had actually switched the VS Code ecosystem because of Copilot. Uh we were all like lites using command line Vim. Uh and uh so we knew that if you built a better mousetrap you could get people to switch you know the bar would be high.
>> Um and then yeah we were very very intentional about eventually in the future we want to touch the model side of things and there's been a whole story of backing into that and that's actually been a really important product lover for us but uh we didn't want to start there. Uh we wanted to just get something out to the world not touch any of the modeling stuff.
>> Awesome. Okay. So, I I told you this anecdote and you said you didn't remember it, but I remember it very well, which is um so the ear the early days were about scale and I I've seen a lot of companies over the years. I've been in the industry for 30 years. I've never seen scale like this this quickly, especially with a small team. And I remember one night I got a call from you and you were like, "Listen, we've taken down one of the big clouds cuz like they can't handle our scale and um there was this actually relatively minor service disruption and then you guys fixed it actually pretty quick and it was fine." But apparently in that time or so Oscar tells me someone showed up at the cursor office and put an iPad on the window and says cursor's down.
>> So like definitely it was like to a point where people are noticing. It was for me it was kind of a shock cuz it's kind of this nondescript building like you know that that they found out.
>> Um so it would be great
>> to hear how you think and the team thinks about handling this much scale especially because I mean you're really at the point that you're
>> you know like you're even stressing the platforms you rely on even though they're some of the largest platforms. I mean there's nowhere to go.
>> Yeah. Um yeah, that that anecdote is lost within the
>> of the many of the many Yeah.
>> back in the day. Um yeah, I think that
>> well early on the way we encountered scale was just it was such a tiny team operating a service that that started to grow very fast. And um my I my co-founders are are great. Um and um but you know we're not the the most experienced group if you can't tell uh just in terms of of years of experience. And so uh yeah very quickly you know we had lots of people using the service. Uh there's ways in which uh especially with things like we have our own file sync system that you can think of it as like there's kind of two or three different sort of mini dropboxes within cursor where you know early on uh within cursor there's kind of like a search engine for the AI. Um, and you know, it seems like a kind of on the surface it doesn't sound like it should be that complex, but it ends up being uh kind of annoying to build. Uh, and depending on how you built it, uh, definitely can start stressing uh stressing the systems that you rely on. Um, but yeah, very quickly we were were getting to a scale when it came to just normal boring cloud services stuff. And so there was a whole story of, you know, we were running a very very large Kubernetes cluster larger than um, many other companies. and then uh trying to figure that out on the fly with five total people at the company and uh having things you know having having hiccups and troubles with that. Uh then we sort of just got a handle of that uh by making some of the right architecture decisions growing the team. Then the next big scaling problem that came up was actually just stressing the API providers. uh and uh that was less a being very clever technically to get past that scale and that was more a relationship thing where uh you know these I I don't think the API providers really knew what to make of us because it's you know these four 20somes and their thing now comprises like a really high double digit percent of their API revenue and uh now they're going to have to make capacity planning decisions uh decisions maybe financing decisions to you know handle the growth under the hood And that was more of just a uh and I think it's something we're still learning, you know, forging relationships with people. Uh it was also getting very clever about turns out uh these tokens, these API tokens, you can get them for the same model for many providers. Uh there are there are token resellers that exist out there. And uh it's strategically helpful actually to spread it across multiple providers which have committed contracts. And so we got very good at hunting out all the all the sonnet tokens that exist in the world. Um and uh so that was that was a level of scale that was tricky for us. I I'd say now right now we do a decent bit of our own uh training. We do some of our own inference and so there's like now a whole you know side of the scale uh there's there's a whole new scale problem there in and making decisions there. Do do you do do you think that this converges on you know heterogeneous dependency on third parties or do you think it converges on largely you're running your own infrastructure or like have you not gotten that far
>> for the underlying uh model inference?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> No no no no just not just just infrastructure in general like more and more you're pulling stuff in house just so that you have control of it
>> just for operating our our website desktop app back end things like that.
>> Yeah. Um I think we've been pretty multi cloud from the start. Uh and so I think we're definitely on a default path to heterogeneous rely on multiple providers.
>> We have data bricks snowflake we have uh we're on AWS GCV and Azure uh for cell for web stuff. uh we use uh planet scale for databases and have had our whole uh you know one of the scaling the kind of boring cloud services uh stuff was was really reliant on our DB where there was a whole Kubernetes side of things things like core DNS going down then there was a whole series of DB stories where some of things we're doing are like pretty DB heavy and uh eventually we got to a point where uh well usually you should just scale the RDS instance that works well for a long time eventually you run out of that and then it's like do you shard the database
>> uh and then we switch AWS's service which claims to not let you shard the database.
>> Turns out uh that's wrong.
>> You think of these public clouds as they have it all together. Uh but really it's a very small set of customers for the highest highest level of scale and they're figuring it out on the fly. Uh and so planet scale has been amazing there where we went from limitless to planet scale.
>> Sam Sam, are you here?
>> Thank you very much Sam. We appreciate it. All us developers for Sam. Um but yeah no for us I think multiple providers uh multiple providers are are great at different things and so that's our plan. Um just quickly before going towards talent um so you've had to balance focus which you were very good at since then you've done a lot of multi-product stuff right you did bugbot you did CLI um you're doing infrastructure improvements to what extent is the decision to do this is pretty organic um and just obvious and to what extent do you kind of do prioritization in a more deliberate way or maybe just walk through how you think about kind of where to expend R&D resources given everything that you're you're dealing with.
>> Uh it's pretty deliberate. We try to say no to lots of things,
>> but I do think we're going to need to be a multi- product company going into the future.
>> I think that there's a big multi-product opportunity in our space where there's a whole AI coding bundle to be built and we kind of want to be the uh for for many of our customers like the AI coding provider for them. Um and uh so far that's really focused on this wedge in which is you know the surface that you sit in the pane of glass that you sit in when you're an engineer going about your day um uh building software which is the editor and we think that there's still so much more to do there and that's the main focus. That's where we spend resources. Um we do think that uh the ways in which work is changing within the editor start to affect how teams work together too. And so we think that that presents both a big strategic opportunity. It's also just like necessary to have the best editor thing is to also have this compliment that's, you know, helping teams review and collaborate a little bit more.
>> Um, and so we're intentional about it. Uh, it's been, uh, we're we're still, I think, learning how to how to do it well. Um, like how to give projects like that air cover. um how to do cross-ell where um there's really really big cross-ell opportunities in our space both from a like growth engineering PLG show them the button side of thing and then you know enabling the sales team
>> I I will say there like many founders underappreciate how tough it is to go from single product to multi-product when it comes to actually go to market I mean it's it's very very complex
>> yeah and a lot we're still learning there uh but you know uh very uh very excited by kind of the early results
>> awesome okay I'd like to shift towards talent um so I think you one of the more rigorous and thoughtful talent uh hiring processes I've ever seen. Like I try to like reserve a part of my evening and weekends to help you uh to talk to and recruit people. And every and before I hop on every one of these calls, I get this incredibly well thought out like here's where it is. Here's what we've done. You know, I mean, I I just think there's so much behind this process. So, if you wouldn't mind, can you just kind of walk through how you think about recruiting and kind of how you run your process and what you found out what works and maybe what doesn't work?
>> Yeah. Have your board members do lots of calls until they cry uncle prepare
>> them. Take advantage of their time.
>> Uh um yeah, how have we thought about recruiting? Um
>> I think that there are ways in which our process is uh pretty orthodox. I think that some of the things that might be unique, one is uh normally when you're a small company, there's this thing that you do with the first set of engineers where you basically just have people contract with you and you probably don't do a normal lead code style thing, a normal interview loop. That's what we did. Uh it felt the most natural because you're kind of getting to the ground truth of do you work well with the person? And then usually people stop it after a couple of a couple of hires. Uh we have and we've tried to kill it many times internally. I've tried to kill it too. Uh uh we still kind of do that where everyone who gets hired on the edge team and the design team uh spends two days in office and they work on a project and it's very free form. It's not like you know you have this whiteboard interview and then that whiteboard interview and your days two days are packed. It's here's a desk, here's a laptop, uh you know, here's three projects you could work on. Here's a frozen version like of an you know a frozen older version of the codebase with the dev setup. uh just go do it and then you uh this functions this has kind of two functions. So one function is uh I think it's a really great test that tests for orthogonal things to the normal coding style interviews that we we ask before people get on site uh where you're seeing you know can they go end to end in the codebase like are they agentic uh our engine design and product are pretty tightly coupled and so we try to hire product engineers who have product sense this gives you a sense of that you know what would they build if left in a vacuum without a team um and so I I think it really gives us a lot of signal on raw technical skills needed to be successful in our environment. And um you know that gives us a sense of would we want to be around you? Do you want to be around us? Uh if one of the benefits, you know, maybe sub sub point third benefit is uh it really gives the candidate a ton of information about the company uh and what it's going to be like to show up on the first day. Um, and I think that that's led to, you know, really really really high chance of fit on their end too, uh, if they say yes. And so that's that's one of the more unorthodox things we do is we have this two-day onsite and we've clung to it even though we are over 200 people now.
>> And but you don't do this with like go to market or other
>> we did initially. Uh, so yeah sales guy like
>> Yeah. So yeah no so to hire our first reps we would give them we're like here are inbound leads and
>> that's awesome. have a quota.
>> Yeah, it was Yeah, it was a little bit more structured where, you know, they would do a demo. Uh they would do some like mock customer communications,
>> but we would give them access to the real the real data and have them dig in. I think the very very very first one we did was was literally like
>> the rep came in, we showed them everything. We're like,
>> teach us how we should do sales.
>> Uh but then it started to get more structured.
>> Okay. Awesome. Great. Um so listen, I think this wave in general is changing a lot of orthodoxy on how you build companies. I mean it just it's a new super cycle like you know we're questioning everything. You're definitely on the forefront of that. I mean you've got you know relatively I would say junior folks running very large orgs and it's working out incredibly well. Another thing that you're you're you're doing I would say almost to like an extreme amount is is is M&A. Like you've been very very good at doing these kind of tuckins for a 2-year-old company, right? Like I mean clearly a lot of private companies acquire companies but you've done a great job about that. Would you be open to sharing kind of how you think about this? I mean like the adage preai was like startups should never buy startups and it's actually been hugely successful not just with curs but across the board and so I think it'd be great to hear how how that's worked for you. Any lessons learned?
>> Yeah, I think that so far for us uh it's been consistent with an approach of do anything possible to get the most talented people.
>> Yeah. And so, you know, early on as part of our uh, you know, us growing the initial 10 people on the team, uh, we did crazy recruiting stunts like, you know, flying I Yeah, some some of these, you know, are kind of normal and people do them, but but a lot of things like flying across the world to the person. Oh, yeah. Uh, after they say no. Uh and um and then when they say no after you fly across the world, uh you make up a dinner with researchers that's happening in SF that they should totally fly to and come to 6 months later so that you can reignite the conversation and convert them to be an engineer and then they end up being one, you know, one of the best people on the team. Um that that happened. Um but so yeah, we've we've really tried to get the most talented people possible and I think that sometimes uh you know either conveniently or inconveniently those people are working on companies. Uh and that's where mostly it's come from. It's come from the talent side of things. Um, I think increasingly in the future, you know, with the whole suite of products that are possible in our space and with the benefits we think of of bundling those together, we're especially interested in uh earlier than than most companies in their maturity uh using M&A as a strategic tool also to to start to build out a couple of like GM type structures within the company and add on complimentary products. Um and yeah that's something where you know for each new product that becomes possible in our space we might try doing it internally. We might look to see what the market has to offer and if there's really the right fit with the right set of founders uh you know would would love to join up with them. Um yeah that's a little bit about how we thought about it uh so far. The first the first real M&A we did was uh was super maven uh and so uh this uh as just one concrete example this was a team of five people. It was started by the person who had built co-pilot, GitHub copilot before GitHub copilot which was tab 9. Y
>> um and was also a researcher at OpenAI had done a bunch of work with uh with John um uh thinking machines and uh uh Jacob's Jacob's fantastic and uh he was working on you know we were working on autocomplete models uh he was working on autocomplete models uh the stuff the technology we were doing is very complimentary and just really built a relationship stayed close over many months and it was really us like approaching him and being being kind of aggressive. All right. So, uh, I have to wrap it up now, but I want to ask you one more question.
>> Sure.
>> Okay. So, and this actually came from one of your candidates. I just thought it was such a clever way to, uh, to to to phrase it. He's like, you know what? Cursor is disrupting software, and which we all agree. I mean, this whole AI wave is disrupting software. And he said, but cursor is written in software. So, to what extent is this ora boros somehow, you know, ushering in your own disruption? And I thought it was nicely philosophical. So I'd love any thoughts you had because my answer to him was like well I'd rather be the one disrupting than not but you know that felt like a very VC thing to say. So yeah wait and so is the like uh cursor do narrative like if cursor is so good then someone could
>> no this is someone that was super excited to it was a very philosophical person was super excited to join and it was like basically listen if if you're focused on building the disruption
>> but you know the the foundation of the product is what's being disrupted what does that actually mean
>> um yeah I think that maybe two things one is I think despite the headlines. Despite how much demand there is in this market and how much software has changed over the last few years, it's so far away from being automated%.
>> It's so inefficient. Building software in a in a professional setting, especially with, you know, anywhere from dozens to tens of thousands of people, it's just
>> it's really easy in an executive level to um underestimate just how far away we are from from the limit of of automating software. So, I think that there's a really really long way to go. There's a really long messy middle. Yeah. Um and then yeah I think that one of the challenges uh key challenges facing the company uh in the future and we've faced in the past is we are going we are in a market that's like you know had a iPod moment and like it's going to have an iPhone moment and another iPhone moment and uh I think that there have been a couple of those so far. I think that there are definitely more in the future and we've tried to build a company to be a place that that can continually build those things because if we don't, you know, uh we're kaput. Uh and I think that it's actually, you know, it's a challenge. It's one of the nice things about the physics of the space too because I think it's one of the things that makes it pretty tricky for a Microsoft to really compete in a big way.
>> Um but yeah, definitely definitely a challenge.
>> Awesome. Great.
>> Well, thank you so much. Please give the Michael a hand for coming and doing this. Thank you so much for coming. Thanks for your leadership.
