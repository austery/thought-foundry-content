China has weaponized its critical minerals
monopoly, on which
the entire Western industrial base
depends.
According to the European Council
of Foreign Relations experts, Doctor
Tobias Gherke,
This dependency is even worse
than Europe's
2021 dependance on Russian gas,
which led to a massive energy
crisis in 2022.
So if China cuts its critical minerals
completely today,
our industry is not prepared.
Vast elements of our base industry
in Europe, but also in other places,
rely on these UN access
to permanent magnets, most importantly.
So if that would stop tomorrow,
quite frankly, some of these industries,
like the automotive industry,
would grind to a halt.
There would be no more production
very quickly,
and that would have incredible
cascading effects.
Imagine that 13 million people are
employed in the car industry in Europe.
Imagine,
95% of them would stop production.
I mean, we are talking,
an economic crisis
of historic proportions.
No wonder governments ranging from Europe
to the US to India, are scrambling
to reduce their dependance
on Chinese minerals like rare earths,
copper and lithium.
But this will be incredibly hard.
China's mineral monopoly is protected
by its massive scale,
massive government subsidies,
lax environmental regulations,
and China churns out 
hundreds of thousands
of academics
and PhDs in mining and geology.
And, you know, in Europe,
it's a drop in the ocean.
And so, even if you're now wouldn’t
want to reverse this,
you know that, 
the deck is stacked against us.
But there is hope for the West
in the 1980s and 1990s, the West
dominated all of these industries,
and China was able to break
through the Western monopoly
through clever policies.
So can the West learn from China
to take back its sovereignty?
Yes, absolutely.
In this video, I'll show you how
they can do it in five steps.
But before getting into the specifics,
let's do a quick recap
of why critical minerals are so important.
For simplicity,
let's start with the critical minerals
that have been in the news the most.
We are discussing, 
critical minerals and rare earths.
Probably heard people
talking recently about rare,
what is so special
about these rare earths?
Sure.
The F-35 jet, state of the art US
Navy destroyer nuclear attack submarines.
I found they all contain
thousands of pounds of rare earths.
But what for the main product
that is made out of refined
rare earths is our permanent magnets.
These are magnets
that do not need an external power source
to generate their magnetic field.
They allow modern wind turbines,
for example,
to transform wind into electricity.
They are at the core of loudspeakers,
microphones, and all of our headphones.
The new Nintendo Switch to has super
snappy
magnetic attachments that sound like this
sounds good, but perhaps more
crucially, modern cars
cannot be made without permanent magnets.
They power your car's trunk sense
or your car's steering system, its air
conditioning actuator, the window
lifting motor and for electric vehicles,
even its entire motor.
So this is why it really matters to that.
China holds holds a global share of earth
refining and permanent magnet production,
somewhere around 95%.
And worryingly,
China has recently introduced
a licensing system
that requires any firm in the world
to apply for a Chinese license
to use these magnets.
And need to go to Beijing and say, hello,
I'm Volkswagen.
I need that permanent magnet.
Do I get a license if Beijing says no?
Volkswagen.
Stellantis for the entire western
car industry ground to a halt.
And even if they can replace
all the permanent magnets all over Western
cars, that will be so expensive
that they would soon be
crushed by competitors
that do have a license from Beijing.
China has already shown
that it is willing to use economic weapons
like this to devastate local industries.
For example, in 2023, China no longer
granted Chinese firms
licenses to export graphite to Sweden.
It wasn't exactly clear
why it did this, but publications
like The Economist have mentioned
that it may have been triggered
when a Swedish free speech group
gave an award to a Chinese dissident.
Although the reason could also
have been strategic for a while,
Sweden's promising battery startup
Northvolt seemed like the only company
that could be competitive
against Chinese producers.
But two years after China's ban,
Sweden's Northvolt
shut its doors for good in Sweden
only 10 to 15 years ago,
this would be unthinkable.
Back then, the dominant idea
was that the global free market
just determines everything.
If a battery company wants to buy minerals
and it is in short supply,
the price will just go up for everyone
at the same time.
And the highest bidder, well,
they will buy.
The only job of the government
was still at the free market.
Function as efficiently as possible.
This logic no longer works today.
Governments are increasingly realizing
their role is no longer
just about making markets efficient.
It's also about protecting domestic
industries from foreign manipulation.
Therefore, governments have now
been forced to think carefully about
critical minerals and critical materials
more broadly, which are defined
as any materials that have, number one,
a high risk of supply chain disruption.
And number two, serve an essential
function in one or more technologies.
By this definition, a rare
earths are clearly a critical material.
China now has a massive power
over foreign manufacturing firms
because it has a monopoly
or near monopoly in the two
other parts of the supply chain
mining and refining.
On average,
China controls 54% of rare earth mining.
But far more importantly, it controls
about 77% of rare earth refining.
This is the pattern that we see
all across industries
that power the modern,
increasingly electrified global economy.
For example, if we look at copper,
which is the main conductor
of electricity, we can see that
mining is relatively diversified.
Even though Chile, the Congo
and Peru are the biggest producers.
But when it comes to refining,
China is much more dominant.
But the West's critical material
vulnerability is not purely limited
to China.
Think, for example, nickel,
which is a key input in steel production,
and it is one of the most promising metals
to be used in batteries.
However, supply is not secure at all.
Given that Indonesia is the epicenter
of global nickel production
and now also refining what you see,
like China,
Indonesia has shown that it is more
than willing to use its nickel dominance
as an economic weapon, as it has banned
all raw nickel exports
to ensure that it also dominates
the nickel refinement industry.
However, so far,
China has smartly moved in to make sure
many of the best Indonesian based
nickel refineries
are in fact Chinese companies.
But nickel is a rare exception where
a country other than China dominates.
If you look at the most common
element used in batteries,
lithium, we can again see that in mining.
Sure, China is a big player,
but Australia is actually more important.
However, Australian mines largely
depend on Chinese refining capacity,
making Western battery manufacturers again
largely dependent on China.
This pattern holds for almost all critical
minerals graphite, cobalt, you name it.
Mining
dominance is different for a mineral,
even if China
almost always plays a big role.
But the real story is about refinery.
China dominates
almost all critical mineral
refinery, giving it an insanely powerful
economic weapon
that it is
now starting to use to get both Western
and non-Western countries
like India to do what it wants.
But before we get to
how the West can respond, this, of course,
raises the question why is China
so dominant in mineral refinement?
Because it really wasn't always like this
just a few decades ago.
In fact, after the Second World War,
the dominant rare earth player
was actually the United States
thanks to the massive mountain
pass mines in California.
So, ironically, as US Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent recently said,
the technology, especially in rare earth
magnets, it's being used against us.
It was U.S.
technology, but Japan and Europe
also played a major role.
France, Germany, Portugal, Spain
all of them had strong
mineral mining industries and not.
So what happened?
How did the Chinese take over this
strategic industry?
The answer actually consists of two parts.
The first part is Chinese strategy.
Interestingly, there are some rumors
that China's rare earth monopoly was a
result of a grand geo economic strategy
set out already by Deng Xiapeng in 1992.
But according to Michaela Roibu.
I hope I pronounced correctly
who was doing her doctoral research
on China's rare earth monopoly.
China's current
dominance is probably and ironically,
a result of industrial protection by Japan
and the US in the 1990s, which excluded
Chinese firms from obtaining
the know how to refine critical minerals.
Now to counter this,
they were forced to attract a lot of
foreign investment and talent
and knowhow into minerals
and to the mineral space,
mostly from Europe.
And they did this by giving foreigners
all sorts of juicy advantages,
like tax credits
that gave lax environmental protection.
Crucially, the Europeans
let them do this. Why?
Well, two reasons.
The first is the increasingly dominant
free market philosophy in the 1990s.
If European firms
could produce more cheaply in China,
then of course they were free to do it.
The second reason
was environmental protection.
You see, refining critical minerals
is really a really dirty business.
You will need a lot of a big chemical mix
to clean, to wash off the actual mineral
that you want.
The 1990s was also a time of rising
environmental regulations in the West.
Western firms could dodge
these regulations by moving to China.
And politicians were actually quite happy
to be rid of these highly
polluting industries. Bye bye.
However, just as with Western car firms
moving to China,
the Chinese had regulations in place
that all foreign firms needed to set up
local joint ventures where they had
to transfer knowledge to China
if they wanted to work cheaply in China.
The thing is, businesses care
about profits in the next couple of years.
They do not strategize about competition
in 40 years time.
So they happily moved their production
to China.
But today, after 3 or 4 decades,
just as German car manufacturers now
struggle to compete with the Chinese
firms, the rare earth mining
and especially refinery business
is now dominated by Chinese firms,
giving the Chinese government
their incredibly powerful economic weapon.
So, of course, Western governments
are now struggling
to respond and actually,
it may be too late.
For at least four reasons.
Environmental regulations,
this is, number one, are still much
stricter in the West than in China.
Reason number two Chinese firms now
have massive, massive scale advantages.
Reason number three Chinese firms
in strategic sectors are often
heavily subsidized by the government
if they need it.
And then finally, number four,
China churns out
hundreds of thousands of academics
and PhDs in mining and geology.
And, you know, in Europe
it's a drop in the ocean.
And so even if you and I wouldn't
want to reverse this,
you know, that the, 
the deck is stacked against us.
And yet the deck was also stacked
against China in the 1990s,
when all of the knowhow
and technology was in the West.
So what can the West learn from China?
Here's how the West should respond.
And actually,
this is not just applicable to the West.
It's applicable to any country
that wants to remain independent
in the new age of geo economics, where
great powers, including those in the West,
I have to say,
will not hesitate to use economic weapons
to achieve political goals.
Any country that wants sovereignty in this
age needs a grand geo economic strategy
in which they set themselves a goal
for how independent they want to be.
Importantly, such a strategy
is not just about critical minerals.
It considers minerals.
It considers oil.
It considers cloud
computing infrastructure.
It considers an entire economy.
Having a ground geo
economic strategy does not mean
every country
should be independent in everything.
Giving it complete
independence is often simply impossible
and in all cases extremely inefficient.
So any Western strategy should focus
on achieving the right balance between
full free market type specialization
and autarky for critical minerals.
This means the following step number one
is that Western governments should learn
from China who is, by the way, already
stockpiling oil, grain and even pork.
Then, in the age of geo economics,
every nation needs some buffers.
In this case of critical minerals,
for the most part, Western governments
are already starting to do this.
Or planning to do this.
Step number two.
Most Western governments need to realize
that gaining some more independence
from Chinese minerals can best be done
in a big alliance.
Europe and Japan
don't have many minerals, but
they do have some knowhow left
and they have lots of money to invest.
Australia and Canada
have lots of minerals,
but they almost completely rely on Chinese
refineries.
Therefore, Western governments
like Japan, Australia, Canada and EU,
the US and Australia
and many more are already forming
mineral alliances
between individual countries.
But in my opinion,
these individual alliances are likely
much less effective than a concerted
big group effort.
Just as NATO as a big alliance
is far more effective than a patchwork
of defensive alliances
between individual states, and Mineral
Alliance is also far more effective
if it is big.
Still, even with a big, very big alliance,
step number three is needed.
We know that Chinese industrial advantages
are now
just too big for private Western companies
to overcome.
On top of that,
as Scott Bessent recently said,
any time anyone tries to stand up
one of these rare earths
critical mineral facilities, Chinese
come in, they flood the market.
In other words,
the Chinese state
is actively coordinating its industry to
prevent foreign competition from rising.
Therefore, a free market approach
just will not work.
Instead, governments need to study and
copy China's industrial policy approach.
As a group, they should use
industrial policy tools like subsidies,
price floors and tariffs to help
the mineral, mining and, crucially,
refinery industries
recover in allied countries.
On top of that, in step number four,
Western countries should use industrial
policy tools like subsidies and tariffs
strategically to speed up
the development of alternative
and recycling technologies as well.
And yes, this is already happening.
For example, France is building a massive
magnet recycling plant in the south.
And when it comes
to technological replacement,
BMW, BMV and Renault
are already experimenting
with the new electric motors
that do not rely on rare earths.
But these are just small initiatives.
There is no big strategic effort yet.
The potential of Chinese retaliation
then brings us to step five.
Western countries
should develop a portfolio
of other technologies and materials
on which China relies,
and they should create a doctrine
that determines what happens
if any ally faces a geo economic attack.
Because even mineral poor regions
like Europe are not powerless.
Imagine Europe would say, in response
to China threatening
to cut roads in
Europe would respond and say,
and then we will cut off the maintenance
and servicing of Airbus aircraft in China.
It would be huge.
Similarly,
like Russia did in 2020, China holds
almost all of its financial reserves
in Western currencies.
So in this step five, it's clear
that there is enough leverage in the West
to make a doctrine that essentially makes
clear in geoeconomic terms that if you do
X, I will do y, and our
y needs to be very large and painful
because you want to escalate
in order to de-escalate.
And while, of course, it is clear
that when it comes to critical minerals,
these five steps are intended to
counter China.
But I personally think Western countries
should develop their geo economic strategy
not just to target critical minerals,
and also not just to target China.
We have to be honest.
China is not unique in using geo
economic weapons
to get others to do what they want.
Under Trump, the US is doing this as well,
and as we've seen
throughout history, the West has done
this from time to time as well.
But yeah, that's my take.
Have I been unfair to China?
Do these steps make any sense?
Am I forgetting something?
