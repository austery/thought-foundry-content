In this room, one in eight women
will develop breast cancer
and one in 43 will die.
Looks better for men,
but they're not immune.
And in 2022,
the deaths by breast cancer
were 670,000 globally
and 11,500 in the UK.
That's 32 people every day.
And cases are predicted
to rise to 70,000 by 2040, right?
But here's the good news.
The death rates are actually falling
and they have been falling,
remarkably, by 44 percent.
Why?
Certainly because interventions and better
screening and better treatments,
but definitely because we can
catch cancer earlier.
So let's talk about screening.
For breast cancer, we have the gold
standard of mammography,
which is followed by biopsy
if the result is positive.
And we have the breast screening
program that invites women every year
after a certain age.
But actually the target --
is 70 percent nationally,
but the uptake can be really low
in some areas of the country.
So why is that?
We really need to understand the reasons
why we can't do more screening
and why we can't have a better uptake.
Because I think we can.
So NHS backlogs, obviously
this has been exacerbated by COVID.
Let me say also by decades
of underfunding of the NHS.
We have reduced resources.
So there is a disproportion
between the number of screenings
needed and radiologists.
Also, the mammography
equipment isn't exactly present
in every city, town,
village that you would need.
So we have here an accessibility problem
which is significantly worse
for underserved populations.
Let's be honest, I personally
would choose my life over my modesty,
but this is not exactly an exam,
a test that preserves your modesty, right?
And for some populations,
this is absolutely
culturally unacceptable.
It is invasive.
There is a fear associated with radiation.
And for many women,
it's actually so painful
that they refuse to go.
There was a recent survey of 2,000 women,
and a staggering 21 percent said
that the embarrassment of being topless
and the fear of pain
would actually prevent them
from undertaking screening.
And women know it is so
important to take up the screening,
but this still happens.
So but what if I told you
that my team and I are [producing what is]
probably a game changing test?
Looks exactly like a test
that will bypass NHS backlogs.
That doesn't need
any more resources from NHS.
That actually preserves your modesty
because it's completely non-invasive.
There is no rejection
and pain associated with it.
And what if I told you that this comes
from the world of fingerprints?
CSI and fingerprints, right?
An invisible world
like that of a fingerprint.
We all know fingerprints are for, right?
So they're used to identify a suspect
by comparing the mark that they left
at the crime scene
with the fingerprint
that has been taken upon arrest
or from prior convictions, right?
So you might tell me, OK,
what's this got to do with breast cancer?
So bear with me, because I need you
to rethink what a fingerprint is.
And this video helps you to do just that.
So this is a close up
of a fingertip, right?
And the elevated part
of the skin are the ridges.
And then you see these little holes there.
Those are the sweat pores
from which the sweat comes through.
And as you're sweating,
it's beautiful, formation of sweat there,
as soon as you touch a surface,
you transfer that sweat onto the surface.
And now you transfer it
in a rather mesmerizing way.
So it's a beautiful pattern of lines
that it is not just a pattern of lines.
It is a pattern of lines
made up of molecules.
What molecules?
Whatever our body produces,
metabolizes and then
eliminates through sweat.
And of course, anything that is sitting
on your fingertip as you go around
in your activities touching things, right?
So that's really what a fingerprint is.
It's a molecular pattern
unique to an individual
by a molecular pattern or lines.
And what can we do with this?
We're exploiting this knowledge.
And in some pioneering research
we have developed a mass
spectrometry technique called MALDI
that actually measures
the weight of the molecules,
and by making these measurements,
we are able to know
what these molecules are,
who these molecules are,
but we can also see them.
So if these molecules are distributed
homogeneously onto the ridge pattern,
by visualizing them,
you can visualize
a beautiful ridge pattern.
So now you get a molecular image
of a fingerprint, right?
And look at this.
Amazing, to me, this is amazing.
Look at the perfection
of that fingerprint.
And what this is, is just a person
that has styled his hair
using a gel, right?
And what that is,
is one of the molecules
that is contained in the gel.
By visualizing that,
we get a beautiful fingerprint image.
And we can even resolve
overlapping fingerprints.
So in this case you can see
the separation of six fingerprints.
Why?
Because we've just
interrogated the software
and recalled the image
of distribution of molecules
that are unique to each
of those fingerprints.
So, for example, we can eliminate
the fingerprint of the victim,
or we can submit to the database
for identification
the fingerprint of the perpetrator.
But although this technique has been used
already nationally and internationally,
it's been endorsed by the Home Office,
that's actually not the only thing
that we can do with this.
Remember, we are looking at molecules
and molecules are there for a reason.
They tell a story about you.
They tell about your lifestyle.
They might tell about the medications
that you're taking.
We can even say something
about your state of mind
if you take drugs of abuse
and even what have you been doing
just prior to or during
committing the crime?
So now you're still asking,
OK, so when are we going to get
to the part of the breast cancer?
OK, we're going to get there.
We were looking at personal information.
So we were looking at the possibility
to, from a fingerprint,
say whether that belongs
to a man or to a woman.
So for this study, we asked the donors
to actually swipe
a fingertip on a surface.
So this is now a smudged fingerprint.
And then we use our MALDI
technique with fire laser,
we get the molecules blast off
and then taken up
by the mass spectrometer
that measures the way.
And we were looking at proteins.
And we discovered
that the protein profiles
between men and women
are different enough.
And we can tell them apart
with the 86 percent of accuracy.
And this is, folks, where serendipity
manifested in all of its beauty.
Because my next question was,
who are these proteins?
And as I was looking into this,
I realized that some of these proteins
actually were already reported
in the scientific literature
as biomarkers of breast cancer.
Let that sink in.
Fingertip smears,
or smudged fingerprints,
contain proteins
that might be able to tell
whether a woman is affected
by breast cancer or not.
So, of course, I rush to my team
and, you know, we have a meeting
and our jaws really dropped.
I mean, mine was still dropping
from the early discovery
and we all had the same two images
together in our mind.
We had a mammogram
versus a swipe of a fingertip.
And also then at that point we thought,
well then can we further
the optimization of this method?
Can we refine it to maybe
produce a non-invasive screening
of breast cancer?
And maybe even just as a pre-screening?
So then only women that are
positive to this very simple test,
go through mammograms.
And that is going to save
a lot of emotional distress
to women and to family,
as well as saving, you know,
NHS a lot of resources.
So CARS organization demos
have actually estimated a cost
of 17.5 billion pounds
associated to breast cancer interventions,
treatment and screening.
It's a lot.
We can't reduce the distress
to families, to communities,
and we can also reduce this cost.
So it took me the best part of six years,
because I was labeled crazy --
The best part of six years
to obtain 45,000 pounds
to prove the concept.
And we did prove the concept.
So with that 45,000 pounds,
I also hijacked some
of the findings that I had.
But anyway, with those 45,000 pounds,
we were able to look at 15 women
That gave us three different
fingerprint smears.
And we then analyzed the smears
in three different locations.
So we had 135 samples to look at.
Simply they came, and did
actually this three times:
one, two, three.
That's my sample.
I know it sounds crazy.
The sample preparation for us
takes about a couple of hours,
but the results
can be obtained in minutes.
And then we trained
a machine-learning algorithm
to recognize the protein patterns
coming from women
with early breast cancer,
benign and metastatic.
And we found out
that we can tell them apart
with the 97.8 percent of accuracy
against the 70 to 90 percent
accuracy of mammogram.
And the results are shown here
in this confusion matrix,
I'm going to try and use the laser.
That's the confusion matrix.
Don't know why it's called confusion.
The confusion matrix.
What it tells you there
is that of 135 samples,
we spotted every time a woman had cancer.
So...
Do you think
that a test that will reduce
the NHS costs,
that bypasses the backlogs,
that doesn't require any more resources,
that is not invasive,
that is painless, radiation-free,
that increases accessibility
because in our vision,
we can take this test at the GP practices
even in the comfort of your own home.
And then we can ship it,
COVID-style, as we used to do.
So you really solve
the accessibility problem as well.
And in doing all this,
it obviously increases compliance
and hence it saves lives.
And do you think there's something
like this is not worth
the investment, the dedication,
the perseverance?
I think it is.
And I think that this is definitely
an idea worth sharing.
Thank you very much.
