Today I’m chatting with Nick 
Lane, who is an evolutionary  
biochemist at University College London.
He has many books and papers which help  
us reconceptualize life’s 4 billion years 
in terms of energy flow and helps explain  
everything from how life came to be in the 
first place, to the origin of eukaryotes, to  
many contingencies we see today in how life works.
Nick, maybe a good place to start would be here. 
Why are eukaryotes so significant in your 
worldview of why life is the way it is? 
First, thanks for having me here. This is 
fun. I love talking about this kind of thing.  
Eukaryotes. What’s a eukaryote? It’s basically the 
cells that make us up, but also make up plants and  
make up things like amoeba or fungi, algae.
Everything that’s large and complex that  
you can see is composed of this one 
cell type called the eukaryotic cell. 
We have a nucleus where all the DNA is, 
where all the genes are, and then all this  
machinery, cell membranes and things.
There’s a lot of kit in these cells. 
The weirdness is, if you look inside a plant cell 
or a fungal cell, it looks exactly the same under  
an electron microscope to one of our cells.
But they have a completely different lifestyle. 
Why would they have all the same kit, 
if they evolved to be a single-celled  
algae living in an ocean doing photosynthesis?
It’s still got the same kit that our cells have. 
We know that because they share all 
of these things, they arose once  
in the whole history of life on Earth.
There could have been multiple origins,  
but there’s no evidence for that.
If there was, it disappeared without trace. 
We’ve got this singularity which happened about 
2 billion years ago, about 2 billion years into  
the history of life on Earth.
This thing happens once that  
gives rise to all complex life on Earth.
The one thing you could conclude from that  
is bacteria and archaea, in terms of their genetic 
repertoire, they’ve actually got a lot more genes,  
a lot more versatility than eukaryotes do.
It’s just that a single bacterial  
cell has much less in it.
But there’s so many different  
types of bacterial cells that overall 
they’ve explored genetic sequence space. 
They had 4 billion years to have a go at that and 
they never came up with a trick which says it’s  
not in the genes, it’s not about information.
There’s something else which is controlling it. 
That something is the acquisition of these 
power packs in our cells called mitochondria. 
Now let’s go to the origins of life.
You have this really compelling story  
where you imagine that the first life forms 
were continuous with Earth’s geochemistry. 
Can you recapitulate the story a little bit?
I’ll tell you how I got there first. 
I started out working on mitochondria.
That took me into the evolution of eukaryotes. 
Eukaryotes acquire these endosymbionts 
that become mitochondria and they  
change the potential of evolution.
It doesn’t change everything immediately,  
but it changes where the endpoints can be.
It allows the evolution of these large, complex  
cells and eventually multicellular organisms and 
us. What are mitochondria actually doing? What  
they’re actually doing is respiration. They’re 
generating energy for cells. They’re doing plenty  
of other things as well, but the main thing we 
can think about is they’re the energy producers. 
They’re derived from bacteria, and bacteria 
produce their energy in exactly the same way. 
They’re generating energy by generating 
an electrical charge on the membrane. 
That charge is small, but 
the membrane’s really thin. 
The charge is about 150 to 200 millivolts, but 
the membrane is five nanometers in thickness,  
so that’s five millionths of a millimeter.
If you shrank yourself down to the size of a  
molecule and stood next to that membrane, you 
would experience 30 million volts per meter,  
which is equivalent to a bolt of lightning.
That’s the strength of the force of the  
voltage across the membrane, which is colossal.
It’s generated by really sophisticated proteins  
that pump protons across the membrane.
Then it’s ATP synthase, which is pretty  
much universal, and it’s a rotating 
nanomotor that sits in the membrane. 
This is colossally complex, interesting 
machinery, and it’s universally conserved. 
It’s as conserved as, say, a ribosome, 
the protein-building factory. 
It’s pretty much everywhere across life.
You wonder, how on earth  
did life come to be that way?
If it’s conserved universally across life,  
it looks like it goes right back to the common 
ancestors of all cells. So there’s the question.  
How did it arise in the first place?
That was, for me, tremendously  
thrilling because it’s a way in, as 
a researcher, to the origin of life. 
How did these energy-generating 
systems arise in the first place? 
My way in was, the gates were opened 
by Bill Martin and Mike Russell who,  
around the early 2000s, were publishing 
some amazing papers together. 
They were saying that in this 
deep-sea hydrothermal vent,  
rather than it being like a black smoker with 
a chimney with smoke belching out of the top,  
it’s like a mineralized sponge with lots of 
pores that are cell-like in their structure. 
You’ve got an acidic early ocean.
You’ve got alkaline fluids coming out of these. 
You’ve got mixing going on in this whole system.
You could at least imagine that you’ve got a pore  
in here which is a bit like a cell 
in terms of its size and its shape. 
On the outside, you’ve got acid ocean 
waters percolating in, and on the inside,  
you’ve got these hydrothermal fluids.
So you’ve got a barrier, you’ve got an  
inside and an outside, and you’ve got more protons 
outside coming in, potentially driving work. 
It’s very much like a cell is structured.
The other thing is, what are these minerals? 
You’ve got these mineralized pores with minerals.
The minerals, we think, on early Earth would have  
been a lot of metals in there, things like iron 
sulfide or nickel sulfides and things like that. 
The reason that’s important is that what plant 
cells do, but also what autotrophic bacteria do,  
is they take CO2 and they take 
hydrogen and they react them together  
to make all the building blocks of life.
Plants get the hydrogen from water, H2O. 
They take the H2 out of water and throw away 
the oxygen, and that collects in the atmosphere. 
But what bacteria very often do is that they have 
got hydrogen bubbling out of a hydrothermal vent. 
They just take the hydrogen straight 
as gas, and they react it with CO2  
and they make all the building blocks of life.
What are the enzymes that they use to do that? 
They’re very often using these same metals that 
you would have found in the early oceans—nickel  
and iron and so on.
How are they powering  
the reaction between hydrogen and CO2?
They’re using this membrane potential,  
the electrical potential—the difference 
in protons between the outside and the  
inside—to drive that work, effectively, 
to power the reaction between hydrogen  
and CO2 to make organics and drive growth.
This was all in place before I came along. 
This was coming from Mike Russell and Bill 
Martin. The details are very uncertain.  
Whether or not you can really drive any 
biochemistry that way is very uncertain. 
But it’s a thrilling idea because 
you’ve got a continuity between a  
geological environment and cells as we know them.
If it did emerge that way, then it would say,  
"Here’s why bacteria have got this charge 
on their membrane," because it was there  
in a hydrothermal vent from the beginning.
It always powered work from the very beginning. 
That’s why, in the end, an 
endosymbiosis that gives rise to  
eukaryotes would free you from the constraints 
of generating a charge on the membrane. 
Now you internalize that in eukaryotes, and now 
you’re free to become larger and more complex. 
You’ve gone from thinking about a puzzle about why 
eukaryotes are special to thinking about planetary  
systems and thinking about the origin of life.
What are the forces that are going to give  
rise to life, how would that constrain 
life, and would we see the same things  
on other planets or something different?
What are the fundamental reasons that it works  
this way? It becomes astrobiology, really. It’s 
a thrilling change of perspective to come from my  
own background, which was to do with mitochondrial 
biology, an organ transplantation once upon a  
time, and spinning on a pinhead, you end up 
working on the origin of life. It’s fantastic. 
It’s so fascinating. Just to recapitulate, 
for my own understanding and the audience’s,  
let’s just break down what we have here.
You have the analog of a cell in these pores. 
You have something which concentrates the buildup 
of these organics so that they don’t just all  
diffuse in some big primordial soup.
This is why you think some primordial  
lake is not where this happened.
It had to be concentrated in some entity. 
Then you’ve got a chemiosmotic gradient, 
a proton gradient, which drives work. 
Specifically, it favors the fixation 
of carbon dioxide to drive the reaction  
with hydrogen gas to make organics.
Then you’ve got, along this membrane,  
catalysts, which are basically early enzymes.
You’ve got enzymes, you’ve got the cell,  
you’ve got the proton gradient.
The story is that you make very simple  
organics with CO2 and H2, and then those simple 
organics are then recatalyzed to make more and  
more complex organics, and TL;DR, metabolism, 
fatty acids, and nucleotides, everything else. 
That’s basically it. What do you 
get if you react hydrogen and CO2? 
What you get are what are called 
Krebs cycle intermediates. 
So carboxylic acids, small molecules made 
only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,  
with this organic acid group at the end, which 
can be 2, 3, 4, 5 carbon units in the chain. 
This is your basic building blocks.
You add on ammonia to this and  
you get an amino acid.
You add more hydrogen on,  
and you’re going to get a sugar.
You react amino acids with sugars,  
and you’re going to get nucleotides.
There are lots of steps along here,  
but this is the basic starting point 
for all of biosynthesis in biochemistry. 
Then if you make fatty acids, they will 
spontaneously, because of the hydrophilic  
nature of their different sides, they 
will spontaneously form a membrane. 
As I say, Krebs cycle intermediates 
are short-chain carboxylic acids. 
A fatty acid is a long chain, 10, 12, 15 
carbons in the chain instead of four or five. 
They will spontaneously, not just alone 
usually but if you’ve got other long-chain  
hydrocarbons mixed up with them—then you 
will form a bilayer membrane spontaneously. 
We’ve done this in the lab, 
and it’s pretty robust. 
You can make these things at 70-90° centigrade, 
across a range of pH from around pH 7 up to  
about pH 12, and in the presence of ions like 
calcium and magnesium and other salts and so on. 
You make a vesicle with a bilayer membrane around 
it, which is the same as a cell membrane. They’re  
amazingly dynamic things. They’re always 
fusing with each other and breaking apart,  
fissioning, separating into two or three.
They’re very dynamic things under a microscope. 
You could have imagined that life is this 
Frankenstein-like moment where things zap  
alive, and now you’ve got life.
I hate that as an idea, but go on. 
Yeah, but that’s the alternative, where the bolt 
of lightning makes these organics, et cetera. 
Here you have this story where every life 
form you see is continuous with something  
which is continuous with something which 
is eventually just continuous with entirely  
spontaneous chemical reactions.
That’s just a very interesting  
way to think about the evolution of life.
A cell is effectively reduced inside, which  
is to say it’s got electrons inside. Outside it’s 
relatively oxidized. You pump all these protons  
out, so it’s acidic outside, it’s alkaline inside, 
and it’s reduced inside. That’s like the Earth.  
All the electrons are in the iron in the core and 
the mantle of the Earth. It’s relatively alkaline  
inside. That’s why there’s alkaline fluids in 
these vents. The outside is relatively oxidized.  
You’ve got all the CO2 in the oceans.
The cells are a little battery with  
the same structure as the Earth.
If you look in a hydrothermal system,  
the cell membranes around the Earth, the 
crust of the Earth is like the membrane. 
Where you have traffic going between the inside 
and the outside is the hydrothermal systems. 
The pores in these hydrothermal systems 
are little cell-like entities as well. 
You keep having on multiple scales this same 
kind of… The idea that the Earth is a giant  
battery that produces little living, cell-like, 
mini batteries, it’s a rather beautiful idea. 
You can’t allow yourself to get too hung up 
on a metaphor, but it’s a beautiful image. 
Yeah, 100%. Basically you’ve got Earth as this 
giant cell, and then from the hydrothermal vent,  
this little bubble pops off.
Bubbling off many copies of the Earth. 
It’s such a fascinating theory. The thing 
I want to understand is what part of  
life the way it works now is contingent, 
and which would you expect to be shared  
even if you found life on another planet?
It sounds like you’re saying that carbon,  
the chemical profile, is just the obvious 
candidate to build life on top of. Proton  
gradients? Is there another way you could 
build these chemiosmotic gradients that  
drive work? We have other chemistry.
In principle, yes, you could use sodium  
ions instead of protons, but it’s very different.
If you’re starting with carbon dioxide, the first  
thing to realize about that is that carbon is 
extremely good at the chemistry that it does. 
It’s forming very strong bonds 
with all kinds of molecules,  
so you can form complex, interesting molecules.
I think of CO2 as a Lego brick that you pluck  
out of the air and you bind it onto something.
You can build things one brick at a time that way. 
Then you can build really interesting complex 
molecules like DNA and RNA from doing that. 
You can’t do that with silicon.
With intelligent design, you can make  
really complex AI robots, whatever it may be, 
but the whole thing requires humans to do it. 
But if you’re thinking about how life would start 
on a planet where there isn’t an intelligent  
designer who’s putting it all together, you 
need molecules that can do that chemistry,  
and CO2 is the outstanding example. Water is 
everywhere. Hydrogen, oxygen, these are all  
elements that are very common in the universe.
So you’re going to keep on getting this same  
chemistry everywhere.
We know that there are,  
from discoveries of exoplanets in recent years, 
if you extrapolate how many we’ve not seen yet,  
the number of wet rocky planets or moons in, say, 
the Milky Way is probably in the order of 20,  
30, 40 billion of them.
What fraction of them would  
you say have a non-eukaryotic life?
I’ll take a punt here. I would expect  
that if you’ve got these same conditions 
on a wet, rocky planet, you’re going to  
be producing these same vents because it’s 
the same chemistry that’s going to happen. 
So even the vents are not contingent in your view?
No. The vents are produced by a mineral called  
olivine, which is really 
common in interstellar dust. 
The mantle of the Earth is made of this 
mineral called olivine. It will react  
with water. When it reacts with water, it’s 
slow, if you were to put a lump of olivine in  
a bucket of water, you’ll not see very much.
But if you’re dealing with the pressures down  
at the bottom of the ocean and warmer 
temperatures, you’re producing bucket  
loads of hydrogen gas in alkaline fluids.
That’s what these hydrothermal vents are. 
Any wet, rocky planet will produce these vents.
There’s evidence for them on Mars from the early  
days of Mars when there were oceans on Mars.
There’s evidence now on moons, the icy moons,  
Enceladus and Europa.
This is going on in  
our own solar system right now.
If there are 20–30 billion Earth-like  
planets and presumably some big fraction of 
them have these vents if they all have these  
rock formations, is your view that a notable 
fraction of them have life that also operates… 
My view would be yes. Any wet, 
rocky planet would have a decent… 
With the same metabolism?
Yes. If you’re starting  
with CO2 and hydrogen, what I’m saying is the 
metabolism is thermodynamically favored chemistry. 
This same chemistry will just go on happening 
because if you react hydrogen with CO2, and with  
another CO2 molecule, the parts of the molecules 
that are going to react are quite predictable. 
This is a naive question, but what is the reason 
to think that there are no alternative chemistries  
which lead to alternative metabolisms?
Perhaps under very different conditions,  
you could end up with…
But if you’ve got essentially  
similar conditions… The other thing is that we 
know that even with very different chemistries,  
you end up with a similar subset of molecules.
The kind of organics you see on meteorites,  
it’s utterly different chemistry going on.
You’re dealing with helium radicals,  
but you’re still seeing amino acids and 
you’re still seeing nuclear bases and so on. 
These are molecules which are basically 
stable and tend to be formed under a  
wide range of conditions.
So 20 billion Earth-like  
planets with water and these rocks.
Not necessarily Earth-like, but wet and rocky. 
If you just had to pull a number out of 
nowhere and just say, "This fraction has  
nucleotides," what fraction would you say?
I would say a substantial fraction. 
Like over 1%?
Yes. I would imagine 50% or something. 
Really?
You say pull a number out of a hat. 
I’m doing exactly what you’re saying.
I’m pulling a number out of a hat. 
I think this kind of chemistry is going to 
give you the same nucleotides repeatedly. 
Again, I know we’re just chatting here.
But according to this story, pretty  
sophisticated organics are extremely 
abundant throughout the universe. 
That’s not to say they’re collecting 
in an ocean at a high concentration. 
What you have in a hydrothermal 
vent is a continuous throughflow. 
Within pockets within this vent, 
within the pores within this vent,  
bound to the walls pretty much within cells.
So within a vent system you could have very  
high concentrations of things ultimately, 
but not necessarily in the oceans or in  
the atmosphere or anywhere else.
I guess you could have prokaryotes  
then who just take over.
We did have this,  
they proliferated through the oceans and 
changed the composition of the atmosphere. 
Not just the atmosphere, but 
also the whole of geology. 
Hundreds of minerals are 
basically the product of life. 
So your view is that if eukaryotes are the 
fundamental bottleneck, you can go from  
geochemistry to early life, that’s easy.
Going from early life to changing the  
entire composition of the Earth 
through early prokaryotes is easy. 
If those two things are easy and then you’ve got 
10 billion planets in the Milky Way that have gone  
to the middle step, does that imply that 
there’s on the order of 10 billion planets that… 
From nucleotides, you’ve then got to get to RNA 
and DNA and ribosomes and molecular machines. 
So there’s a long gap there as well.
So just having nucleotides,  
that’s a requirement to get any further.
I see. Again, if you had to pull a number out  
of the air, what fraction have done that?
Well, a lower fraction, obviously. 
Over a billion?
I would like to be optimistic. 
I would like to think that these processes 
are going to drive life into existence on a  
substantial proportion of these planets or moons.
I would expect that there would be similarities  
in the genetic code.
I would expect that a lot  
of metabolism would look similar.
I would expect that they would  
have a membrane potential driving the work.
Because if you’re dealing with CO2 and hydrogen,  
you’ve got this same fundamental problem.
How do you make them react? 
So there are hundreds of millions of planets 
in the Milky Way which presumably have  
something like ribosomes and DNA and RNA?
Yes, that’s my own thinking. We’re talking  
about serious planetary driving forces driving 
fairly deterministic chemistry that’s going to  
give you the same kind of intermediates which 
are going to have the same kind of chemistry,  
the same kind of feedbacks.
They’re going to push things  
into similar directions.
Now, the further from CO2  
fixation towards genetics you get, the 
less similarity there’s going to be. 
This is not my inclination, but 
if I were a God-fearing person,  
I would hear this and I’d be like, "Wow, 
this is a vindication of intelligent design." 
The laws of the universe just favor this chemistry 
which leads to life, at least according to the  
story, so strongly that it’s hard to resist this 
formation. I’m curious about your interpretation. 
I agree with you. I find it 
almost a little disturbing. 
I have to say that I’m not a religious person 
either, but I don’t object to religion. 
I’m not a militant atheist at all.
I like the fact that religions have  
searched for meaning and searched for origins.
I have some fellow feeling with that search  
and truth in some sense, with 
a small T, in my own case. 
But insofar as this is consistent with the idea 
of a God, the God would be a deist God that  
effectively set the laws of the universe in motion 
and they’re left to play out. This is Einstein’s  
God. In terms of what most people understand 
by God, most people look for comfort in God and  
are looking for something which is meaningful 
to them and who’s been involved in humanity. 
This is a very cold kind of "God as 
thermodynamics" who sets the laws  
of the universe in motion, reproducibly 
gives rise to the same kinds of things. 
Yes, you could interpret it in a 
natural theistic way, but I don’t  
think many people would get that much comfort 
or meaning from that way of seeing the world. 
A very basic question, but if life is not 
only abundant but almost inevitable in all  
these rocky planets, then the bottleneck to 
not seeing aliens everywhere, presumably,  
is eukaryotes which leads to complexity.
There’s more than one bottleneck,  
but eukaryotes is in my own mind the big one.
It would have to be the case that out of  
billions of potential planets that 
could give rise to eukaryotes, only on  
Earth does this chance occurrence happen.
I wouldn’t argue that. Only on Earth? No,  
I don’t think so. What I would 
dig my heels in about a little  
bit is there’s a Carl Sagan cosmological view.
We’re talking about almost the inevitability  
of life arising according to these laws of 
chemistry and thermodynamics, and you get life. 
Then is it going to roll on and inevitably 
give rise to complex life and to humans and to  
intelligence? It’s a beautiful thought. It would 
be lovely if that was how the universe worked. 
But what we know on Earth is that you have 2 
billion years of stasis, and then this apparent  
singular event where eukaryotes arose, and then 
another long gap before you get to animals. 
If you roll back the clock 2 
million years, there aren’t any  
humans around either. We’re just the icing.
Why is it supposedly this hard to have this  
successful endosymbiotic event?
There are multiple reasons. One  
of them is that prokaryotes, we should say 
archaea and bacteria, are pretty small things. 
Having another cell inside you is 
already a difficult thing to do. 
There are occasional phagocytes in bacteria that 
can engulf other cells, but it’s pretty uncommon. 
Once you’ve got these cells inside you, that 
may have happened on scores of occasions. 
There’s some tentative evidence that 
suggests it happened with archaea. 
There’s one nice example where the 
haloarchaea seem to have acquired  
more than a thousand bacterial genes from the 
same source, implying perhaps they had got an  
endosymbiont that they then lost later on.
The question is, how often would it go  
wrong and you lose your endosymbiont?
I guess that would be the more likely outcome,  
that you pick up a bunch of genes and you 
lose your endosymbiont. It simply doesn’t  
work out. It’s hard to know exactly 
what all the bottlenecks are here. 
But there has been some modeling work 
done to see if you get an endosymbiont,  
are you going to grow faster if you don’t have 
the endosymbiont or you do have the endosymbiont? 
And if you’re the endosymbiont, are you going to 
grow faster if you’re outside or if you’re inside? 
Under most conditions that these people have 
looked at there in Santa Fe, the answer is you  
do better if you’re not part of the symbiosis.
Only under certain conditions will you do better. 
So predictably, the endpoint 
is that it doesn’t work. 
Given how many bacteria and archaea there are, 
throughout Earth’s history there are trillions,  
trillions, and trillions of these running around, 
there are many situations in which there was an  
endosymbiosis, and in only one case it succeeded.
The odds would have to be remarkable. 
It would have to be extremely, extremely tough.
It is a vivid way of seeing it. 
We know what bacteria and archaea 
look like and people have been  
studying these things and finding new examples.
There’s a group discovered 10 years ago called  
the Asgard archaea, and they’re relatively 
eukaryotic-like, which is to say they’ve  
got proteins in there and genes that are pretty 
similar to eukaryotic ones. They’re interesting  
cells. They’ve got long processes and possibly 
they can move vesicles around inside them. 
So they’re doing a few eukaryotic things.
But if you look at their internal  
structure, it’s not very complex.
It’s nothing like a eukaryotic cell. 
And if you look at their genome size, 
it’s a standard prokaryotic genome size. 
You’re talking four or five thousand genes.
So these are not eukaryotic by any  
stretch of the imagination.
Then you look at a eukaryotic cell. 
I said this at the beginning, you look at a 
plant cell or an animal cell or a fungal cell,  
or an alga or amoeba under a microscope, and 
they’ve all got the same stuff, and it’s weird. 
Why would a single-celled alga living 
in the ocean have all the same kit  
that one of my kidney cells has?
The easiest way to understand that  
is to say it wasn’t adaptation to an 
external environment to a way of life. 
It was adaptation to an 
internal selection pressure 
If you think about it in terms of a battle between 
the host cell and the endosymbiont for finding  
a way of living together, you can argue for the 
nucleus arising that there is all kinds of genetic  
parasites coming out of the mitochondria forcing 
you to do something to protect your own genome. 
So you can construct a lot of this 
history of eukaryogenesis, it’s called. 
You start with simple cells with a 
cell inside, and you end up with the  
same cell structure everywhere, all these 
endomembrane systems and everything else. 
The broader thing we’re trying to understand here 
is if this story is true, there’s life everywhere. 
But eukaryotes giving rise to intelligent life, 
which is about to go explore the cosmos, is as  
far as we can tell, happening only in one place 
in our light cone. So why is that? You could say,  
"Well, the bottleneck is the eukaryote and it 
is very hard to get a successful endosymbiosis  
which then continues over time.
But what is the fundamental  
problem this is solving?
Large genomes. To have a multicellular  
organism where effectively you’re deriving 
from a single cell, that restricts the chances  
of effectively all the cells having a fight.
There are plenty of examples of multicellular  
slime molds, for example, 
where the cells come together. 
They can form structures like a stalk, 
for example, which loosens spores into  
the environment, but they fight because 
they’re genetically different to each other. 
So you start with a single cell and 
you develop, so there’s less genetic  
fighting going on between the cells than 
there would be if they come together. 
But that means then if you want to have complex 
functions—if you want to have a liver doing  
one thing and kidneys doing something else, and 
the brain doing something else—all of the cells  
have to have the same genes.
You express this lot in the  
liver and that lot in the brain.
So you must have a large genome. 
The only way you can have a large genome is by 
having mitochondria and having a eukaryotic cell. 
There are no examples of this level of 
sophistication of a multicellular bacterium. 
That’s quite interesting. The reason you need a 
large genome is just to put all your eggs in one  
basket so that every cell in the body feels 
incentivized to make the germline continue. 
You’re restricting the amount of fighting.
The thing I was getting at is,  
the eukaryote is solving for a large genome.
It’s allowing the cell to get much bigger. 
Why are we so confident that this is the 
only way this problem could have been solved? 
It just seems like if there are billions of 
planets which have gotten to the precursor  
stage here, none of them can find an 
alternative solution to mitochondria  
for just letting themselves get bigger?
Beggars belief. I know where you’re coming from. 
It kind of makes me wonder whether we’re, 
because we’ve only observed one way to solve  
this solution, we’re assuming that there 
must be only one way to solve the problem. 
The problem itself doesn’t seem… You just want 
a smaller copy of the genome sitting next to  
the site of respiration. That’s the basic 
problem. There’s no other way to solve that? 
Maybe there is, but I think we have to look at 
the probability of certain things happening. 
If you want to have a giant bacterium, there 
are a bunch of giant bacteria around on Earth. 
There’s at least six or seven different, quite 
unrelated species that have evolved giant size. 
The thing that they all have in common is 
they have what’s called extreme polyploidy,  
which is to say they have literally tens of 
thousands of copies of their complete genome. 
So it may be a small genome, we’re 
talking a three-megabase genome,  
so around 3,000 genes in it.
And you’ve got tens of thousands of copies. 
Sometimes the very largest ones have 700,000 
to 800,000 copies of their complete genome. 
The energy requirements for copying all of that 
and expressing all of those genomes are colossal. 
What we have with endosymbiosis, 
we still have extreme polyploidy,  
but we’ve whittled away all 
the genes that you don’t need. 
A symbiosis is based on 
effectively complementarity. 
You’ve got a symbiont that’s doing 
something for the host cell and  
the host cell that’s taking something or 
giving something back to the endosymbiont. 
So it’s a relationship which 
is based on mutual needs. 
One of them becomes much smaller and that 
allows the other one to become much larger. 
So a symbiosis will do it.
Now there could be multiple ways of  
having a symbiosis, but there’s no examples of it.
All of these examples of very large bacteria  
and they all have extreme polyploidy.
None of them have come up with a complex  
trafficking network where you effectively 
take things in and you ship it over there. 
There’s just not enough genetic space.
But just to make sure I understood the  
feature request correctly, it’s basically: 
you want a smaller copy of the genome that  
is only relevant to respiration sitting 
across the entire membrane, and many copies  
of it sitting across the entire membrane.
I guess I’m just, it seems hard for me to… 
You’re incredulous that this same 
thing would be repeated. Yes. 
There’s no other way to solve 
this on the billions of planets? 
Because if there were another way to solve it, 
then what you would expect is that as soon as  
you get to the stage of prokaryotes that have 
other niches that they could colonize if only  
they could drive towards complexity, this would 
somehow be solved and then you’d have eukaryote,  
and then intelligence…
A couple of things I’d say. 
Number one, there’s a thing 
called Orgel’s second rule,  
which is that evolution is cleverer than you are.
Of course, I cannot say that there’s no other  
way that it could possibly happen.
But it’s also hand-waving to say, "Oh,  
evolution’s so clever, the universe is so big, 
there’s got to be another way that it can happen." 
You know, engage your brain and 
tell me how it’s going to work. 
I cannot say it’s the only 
way it could possibly happen. 
But what I’ve said is that wet, rocky planets 
are common. They’re everywhere. You’re going  
to have these same serpentinizing 
things. You’re going to have CO2.  
You’re going to have a similar biochemistry.
You’re going to give rise to bacterial cells  
that have got a charge on their membrane.
That constrains them and every example  
that we know on Earth where they seem to 
have got bigger, there’s a constraint that  
probabilistically happens every time.
They always end up with extreme  
polyploidy and they don’t end up with 
sophisticated transport networks. 
So that’s not to say it’s got 
to happen that way every time. 
Maybe there’s a way around it, but it’s 
not an easy way around it because they  
haven’t done it regularly on Earth.
They haven’t done it at all on Earth. 
The only occasion where it worked on Earth 
was where they came up with eukaryotes. 
That’s not to say it’s the 
only possible way of doing it. 
But if you try and dissect, what are the 
alternatives? I can’t think of any. Ok,  
I’m limited. But if you think there are some, then 
you tell me what they might be and you test them. 
I get this a lot, and it’s fair enough.
Because if I assert to you that life’s going  
to be this way somewhere else in the universe… 
I grew up watching Star Wars and Star Trek and  
reading Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
I love the idea that the universe is full  
of all kinds of stuff as much as anybody.
So I don’t like my position of saying,  
"Actually it’s quite limited and you’re going 
to see the same kinds of things elsewhere." 
It’s not a position that I dreamt of having.
It’s just a position that I’ve been forced into by  
everything that I’ve learned about life on Earth. 
Now, maybe I’m just wrong. But if you simply say  
you’re limited by your imagination, you’re wrong 
because you can’t think of it. Well, that’s not  
science anymore. Now we’re talking about just 
imagination and hand-waving, but it’s not science. 
So I’m giving reasons why probabilistically 
it’s going to be this way. 
What I would say is if you’ve got a thousand 
planets with life on them, maybe life is going  
to be the same way 999 out of a thousand times 
because it’s going to be carbon-based, it’s going  
to be water, it’s going to be cells, it’s going 
to be charges, it’s going to be hydrogen and CO2,  
and you’re going to face the same constraints.
But maybe one other occasion, it’s something  
completely different that I never thought 
of and under very different conditions. 
But there’s a probabilistic thing that carbon is 
so common, water is so common, you are going to  
keep seeing the same constraints again and again.
If it’s the case that a significant fraction of  
rocky planets should have at least 
organics and cells and so forth,  
it feels like we should be able to learn pretty 
soon whether this story is correct, right? 
If that part ends up being true, and we 
also don’t see eukaryotes elsewhere, then  
the whole picture is lent a lot more credence.
But are we about to go to a couple of moons  
and see if we can find some 
organics there and so forth? 
That may take us a while but yeah, we 
already know that there are organics. 
On Enceladus, for example, one of the moons of 
Saturn, when Cassini flew by some years ago,  
there were plumes coming through cracks in the 
ice of water, but with organics dissolved in  
the water, and hydrogen and organic molecules.
The pH is around eight or nine, so it implies  
that underneath that frozen surface, 
which people say is about 5km thick,  
underneath that there’s a liquid ocean.
Underneath that there are hydrothermal  
systems producing alkaline fluids 
which have made the oceans alkaline. 
It’s the same chemistry going on.
So we know there’s organics in these plumes. 
We don’t know what’s under the ice.
I do think that the incentives to  
go to these places and drill into the ice 
and have a look will get the better of us. 
There will always be people saying we shouldn’t 
introduce bacteria from our own system into there. 
Bacteria from the Earth would probably survive 
extremely well in a place like Enceladus. 
It would be lovely to know, and 
I’m all in favor of exploration. 
Help me understand how 
replicators arise in this world. 
If you’ve got these independent pores and 
they’re each individually accumulating their  
own organics through the spontaneous processes, 
initially at least there’s no shared inheritance. 
It’s not like if there’s a very 
successful pore, it then causes  
there to be more pores exactly like it.
Think what I would call protocells inside  
these pores.
The organics  
that you’re making are self-organizing.
A fatty acid bilayer membrane will form. 
What you really need for positive feedbacks 
is to be making the organics inside this  
protocell and for that protocell to 
grow and to make a copy of itself. 
Now it will make a copy of itself, because the 
chemistry, if the chemistry is deterministic, it  
says, this is the chemistry you’re going to get.
If you drive that chemistry through by the  
pressure of hydrogen in the system, you’re 
just going to make twice as many molecules and  
they’re going to divide in two. Now you’ve got two 
protocells. So there’s a form of heredity to that,  
which is they get the same molecules because 
that’s effectively all you’re allowed to do. 
So the thing buds off and then 
settles into another pore? 
Yes.
I see. Okay got it. And this happens  
relatively early in this process?
Yes. 
So the rise of replicators 
happens relatively early. 
I would hesitate to use the word 
replicator here. These are growing.  
I would say they are growing protocells that 
are effectively making more of themselves. 
You could call it a replicator, but I would 
prefer to use the word replicator for something  
more like RNA, which would be the conventional 
term for a replicator, where you are literally  
replicating the exact sequence of this RNA.
At what point do we get to the gene’s-eye  
point of view, where the gene is 
the coherent unit of replication? 
The sooner the better. Which is to say, if you’ve 
got this deterministic chemistry, which is going  
to drive growth and make more cells, it’s 
also a dead end. You can’t do anything else.  
You’re entirely dependent on the environment.
You can’t evolve into something more complex. 
To some extent you can, but you’re 
always going to get the same thing. 
The same environment will 
always give you the same thing. 
As soon as you start introducing 
random bits of RNA into this,  
then you’ve got what you call evolvability, which 
is to say you can begin to resist the environment. 
You can begin to do things which are 
not just dictated by the environment. 
You can evolve and change and leave 
vents in the end and do other things. 
So as soon as you’ve got genes, you’ve 
got the potential to do almost anything. 
If you’ve got naked bits of 
RNA, what tends to happen is  
they’re selected for their replication speed.
They just go on making copies of themselves. 
They don’t become more complex, they 
don’t start encoding metabolism, they  
just go on copying themselves and it’s a dead end.
If you’re trapping them inside growing protocells,  
then effectively they’re sharing the same fate.
If some of them are capable of making that  
protocell grow faster, then they 
will get more copies of themselves  
because they’re inside this protocell.
The protocell’s growing faster, it makes  
a copy of itself and it’s still associated.
So you’ve got selection as we know it in cells  
today, where the replicators are the genes, but 
the system which is being reproduced is the cell. 
Your sort of mitochondria-first viewpoint 
that helps explain why there’s two sexes. 
Maybe you can recapitulate that argument.
But I’m just curious if there were a world  
where prokaryotes had evolved sex, do you think 
they would have likely evolved just one sex? 
I’m going to unpack that a little bit because 
what have mitochondria got to do with sex? 
So what they have to do with sex is that 
effectively the female sex – and this  
goes even for single cells, things that don’t 
have any obvious differences between gametes,  
which is to say they don’t have 
oocytes and sperm or anything. 
They produce little motile gametes that look 
more like sperm than anything else. Both sexes  
would do that. But by definition, the female sex 
passes on the mitochondria and the male does not. 
That’s an approximation, it’s not always true.
There are exceptions to that rule, but it’s  
a rule of thumb in biology that the females 
pass on the mitochondrial DNA. Why would that  
happen? With sex, what you’re doing is you’re 
increasing the variance in the nuclear genome  
and you’re subjecting that to selection, 
and the winners are coming through that. 
Everything which is worse than it would 
have been gets eliminated by selection. 
So you’re increasing variance on nuclear genes, 
the genomes, and then selecting for what works. 
With the mitochondria, they’re passing 
on asexually down the generations. 
There’s a very small genome, but 
there are multiple copies of it. 
The question is, how do you keep that clean?
How do you prevent that from degrading  
and degenerating over time?
Because let’s say you’ve got  
100 copies of mitochondrial DNA and two of them 
acquire mutations, but you’ve still got 98 which  
are doing their job fine, what’s the penalty for 
those two mutations? It’s not very much. You’ll  
hardly notice them. Now you acquire another couple 
of mutations and you can degenerate over time,  
a process called Muller’s ratchet.
It’s basically, these mutations  
are somewhat screened from selection by being 
compensated for by other clean copies you have. 
So how do you get rid of those mutations 
that are building up over time? 
Well, the answer is what you need to do is 
increase variance of mitochondrial genes. 
What you need to do is effectively segregate into 
these cells all the mutants and into those ones,  
all the wild-type ones.
You can do that by multiple  
rounds of cell division.
But it helps if you’ve  
got two sexes where effectively only 
one sex passes on the mitochondria. 
You’re already sampling, you’re 
already increasing the variance  
and you’re increasing visibility to selection.
It’s about the quality of mitochondrial genes. 
Can you help me understand why it’s 
the case that uniparental inheritance  
of mitochondria helps increase variance?
We’re talking about variance between cells. 
If you imagine that you have 100 cells and 
they all come from the same parent, let’s say. 
If you give all the mitochondria that you have 
straight into a single cell without changing  
any of the ratios there, then it’s exactly the 
same as you are. It’s fully clonal. But if you  
take a small subsection of those and say you 
take a random 10%—you give 10% to this one,  
a random 10% to that one, a random 10% to this 
one—randomly, this cell is going to happen to  
have got all the good copies and this cell is 
going to happen to have got all the bad copies. 
Now you subject these 100 cells to 
selection and say, "How are you doing?" 
The one that got all the good 
copies does well, that gets on. 
So what you’re doing is increasing the 
variance between this next generation of cells. 
The ones that got all the mutants, they get hit.
The ones that got all the clean copies,  
they do all right.
The parent had got both  
the mutations and the clean copies.
But how do you distinguish between  
them? It’s about sampling, basically. And 
uniparental inheritance is a form of sampling. 
You’re taking the mitochondria 
only from one of the two parents. 
You’re not mixing up mutations that both parents 
had. You’re taking a subset. So you’re always  
increasing variance between the daughter cells.
Uniparental inheritance is giving you a subset. 
Then there’s the question 
of why there’s two sexes. 
We explained why there’s this evolutionary niche 
for only one parent to pass on the mitochondria. 
So there’s at least two niches.
One is to pass on the mitochondria,  
one is don’t pass on the mitochondria.
Once you’ve established those two,  
then you can ask the question, "Why 
aren’t there more than two sexes?" 
Then you could just say, "Well, there would 
just be a repetition of one of these two. 
These are the two fundamental ones."
I mean, it’s more complex, but the  
thing about two sexes is you could say 
it’s the worst of all possible worlds. 
Let’s take it away from humans so 
we can be dispassionate about it. 
You’ve got these single-celled critters swimming 
around and they’re all producing gametes. 
The gametes look the same as each other 
and they’ll fuse in the same way as sex  
and they’ll line up the chromosomes.
They do exactly the same thing  
that we do on a single-cell scale.
But having two sexes means that you  
can only mate with 50% of the population.
The other 50% is the same sex as you and  
it’s not going to accept your gametes.
If you had three sexes or four sexes,  
then you would be able to mate with a 
larger proportion of the population. 
With some fungi, they still have two 
sexes, but they have mating types as well. 
You can have 27,000 mating types in some 
fungi, which is all about outbreeding. 
So you can mate with just about anything.
If you’ve been to some college campuses today,  
they’re replicating some portion of that.
Becoming fungal, yes. Two sexes then, in that  
sense, is the worst of all possible worlds.
If you had only one sex, if everyone was a  
hermaphrodite, you could mate with everybody.
If you had three sexes, you could mate with  
two-thirds of the population 
and so on. So why two? Well,  
there’s the fundamental difference that one is 
passing on the mitochondria and the other is not. 
Beyond that, if you’ve got multiple mating 
types, you still have one that passes on the  
mitochondria and the other one doesn’t.
So in these fungi that have all of these  
mating types, there’s kind of a pecking 
order that the dominant one will pass on  
the mitochondria and the less dominant 
one doesn’t pass on the mitochondria. 
So you end up with really complex systems.
You can imagine it’s pretty hard to enforce  
this. Stuff can go wrong. The more complex 
the system is, the more it will go wrong. 
So I guess in that sense, why 
do you end up with two sexes? 
It’s partly a minimization of error.
You have this really interesting discussion  
about how this not only explains why there’s 
two sexes, but the particular differences in  
why eggs and sperm developed the way they do, 
why there’s different amounts of replications  
before they are mature, et cetera.
I wonder if we can recapitulate that. 
So as soon as you’ve got this fundamental 
difference, even in single-celled critters,  
that one of the sexes passes on the 
mitochondria and the other one doesn’t…  
Males do not pass on their mitochondria.
This is beginning to explain differences  
in multicellular organisms between the 
sexes, between the nature of the germline. 
In some sense, men do not really have a germline 
in the sense that women have a germline. 
In the female germline, you make these 
oocytes and you put them on ice effectively. 
You look after them, you switch them off as 
much as you can, you try and protect them from  
mutations, you mollycoddle them effectively.
Whereas men just mass-produce  
sperm full of mutations.
There’s a lovely phrase from James Crow, who’s  
a geneticist: "there’s no greater genetic health 
hazard in the population than fertile old men." 
So why would you go on 
mass-producing sperm all the time? 
Part of it is you don’t have to pass 
on the mitochondria, so you’re freeing  
yourself up to mass-produce sperm.
Some of them are full of mutations,  
but a lot of them aren’t.
You mass-produce them and the  
chances are it’s going to work out okay because 
the ones that can swim best, for example, are the  
ones that are more likely to… That’s not strictly 
true, but you can imagine it along those lines. 
But in the case of the oocytes, in the case of the 
egg cells, you’re passing on those mitochondria. 
You don’t want to be accumulating 
mutations in that mitochondrial DNA. 
You want to switch them off as much as 
possible, keep them on ice as much as possible. 
Very much the differences between how 
the sexes end up becoming different  
to each other, boils down to what are the 
constraints on your reproductive system. 
Let’s talk about the Y chromosome, 
which is also not recombined. 
Just the same way that female egg cells try to 
minimize the amount of duplications in order to  
preserve the quality of the mitochondrial 
DNA and prevent errors, why isn’t the  
same thing happening with the Y chromosome?
Shouldn’t all this sperm duplication be resulting  
in all kinds of errors in the Y chromosome?
Well, it does. The Y chromosome is degenerate. 
I’m going to make that the title.
But there are some things that have  
lost their Y chromosome altogether.
And they still have sexes because  
it’s not strictly dependent on the Y chromosome.
If you look at what determines sexes across the  
whole canvas of evolution, it’s weird.
Because amphibians, for example,  
have temperature-dependent sex determination.
So males would develop at a higher temperature  
than females, or sometimes 
it’s the other way around. 
Birds have different sex 
chromosomes to mammals, for example. 
So sex chromosomes have evolved on 
multiple different occasions. What’s  
the Y chromosome doing? Well, the Y chromosome 
is encoding a growth factor, and that growth  
factor switches on other growth factors.
The earliest difference that you could tell  
between the two sexes in embryonic development 
is not the activation of the Y chromosome,  
the SRY gene. It’s the growth rate. 
There was a woman at UCL, where I am,  
called Ursula Mittwoch, who spent her career… 
She had about 15 Nature papers in the 1960s. 
She worked on these kinds of questions.
She saw the growth rate as the common  
denominator that the Y chromosome is saying, 
"Grow fast." Why would you grow fast? Well,  
in part, you can grow fast.
You don’t have any constraints on  
trashing your own mitochondria because you’re 
not passing them on. So you can grow fast.  
This might be an advantage to growing fast.
If you’re a male, you’re going to get the  
resources. You grow faster. If you’re a female, 
you don’t want to grow so fast because you need  
to effectively cordon off your germline to 
preserve the oocytes for the next generation. 
Until you’ve done that, you don’t 
want to trash your mitochondria. 
So you’ve got a delay phase 
before you can start growing fast. 
Interesting. Is this why women live longer?
Ursula Mittwoch argued that  
that was exactly the case.
We don’t know for a fact that that’s true. 
But it’s quite common that females live 
longer than males, not just in humans,  
but in Drosophila as well, they usually do.
Suppose that evolution on humans just continued  
naturally for the next billion years.
We didn’t have AGI and  
human gene editing, et cetera.
Is the equilibrium that you’d anticipate that the  
Y chromosome would then just fade away altogether 
and there’d be some other way of determining sex  
and sex-dependent characteristics?
There are, and it has disappeared  
altogether in some species.
Usually what you retain is one gene which causes  
a different rate of growth. The Y chromosome 
is degenerate. It’s lost most of its genes. 
The thing about Muller’s ratchet—which is 
the degradation of things when you don’t  
have sex or you don’t have any recombination—is 
that there are two factors that influence it. 
One of them is the population size.
In bacteria, if you’ve got a small  
population and they’re not sexual, then you 
accumulate mutations in that population. 
But if you’ve got a much larger population, 
the closer you get towards an infinitely large  
population, they’re not all going 
to accumulate the same mutations. 
So the population as a whole is going to be fine.
This goes back decades in population genetics. 
The other thing which is less explored in 
population genetics is the size of the genome. 
With bacteria, if you increase their 
genome size up to eukaryotic-sized genomes,  
you can’t maintain a larger genome.
You’ll accumulate mutations in  
that genome, and it’ll shrink again.
With the Y chromosome, yes it shrunk. 
It’s a tiny chromosome in 
comparison with all of the rest. 
It’s really how many genes can 
you maintain in a good state? 
With the Y chromosome, you only 
need a couple of genes in there. 
It’s the SRY gene saying grow faster, and 
you only need that to remain functional. 
Selection at the level of fertile or infertile 
men will weed out the ones that have got a  
non-functional SRY gene.
It’s not as if you’ve  
got a patchwork of mutations.
You can afford to degenerate your  
Y chromosome down to almost nothing 
and you’ll still be functional. 
It’s quite interesting because you were 
saying that the same thing happened to  
the mitochondrial DNA, which is a tiny 
genome, and has shrunk over time, starting  
from the original bacteria that was engulfed.
It’s gone down from, say, 3,000 or 4,000 genes to,  
in our own case, 37 genes.
You cannot sustain a  
large genome if you’re inside.
As I said, population size matters. 
If you were a free-living bacterium living out 
there in the wild with a population of a million,  
and now you shelter inside another cell and it’s 
a small cell, now you’ve got a population of five. 
You will accumulate mutations and you can’t 
resist them, so you’ll lose genes. So your genome  
shrinks. That’s what happened to the mitochondria.
You just can’t maintain a bacterial-sized genome. 
It might be worth explaining why it is the 
case that sex is preferable to lateral gene  
transfer in the sense of systematic pooling 
and parallel search across gene space. 
If there is this advantage of sex and 
bacteria have some antecedent to it,  
why didn’t they just get the whole thing? 
Is it just that it’s not 
compatible with their size? 
I think they had no need for it.
What they do is lateral gene transfer. 
Basically you pick up random 
bits of DNA from the environment. 
It can be a bit more sinister than that.
You can kill the cell next to you  
and take its DNA and load that in.
That does happen, but for the most part,  
you pick up bits of DNA from the environment.
It’s usually small pieces,  
usually one gene’s worth or something.
You’d only do that if you’re a bit stressed. 
If things aren’t going well for you, 
you will then pick up bits of DNA,  
bind it into your genome and hope for the best.
For most critters, most of the time it’s not  
going to work, but for one of them 
it does, and they will take over. 
It speeds up adaptation to a changing environment.
Why are they only using one gene? 
There’s two ways of seeing this.
You’ve got a bacterial-sized genome,  
it’s pretty small.
You’re going to replicate  
faster if you keep that genome small.
It’s kind of a disadvantage to have a big,  
unwieldy genome. Eukaryotes have 
that. It’s an interesting question.  
Why would you have such a big, unwieldy genome 
that takes longer to copy? Bacteria are really  
streamlined. They get rid of genes they 
don’t need and then they can grow faster. 
But now the conditions change and now you need 
this gene. So what do you do? You pick it up.  
You just pick up random genes and hope for 
the best, pick up the right one and off you  
go again. Bacterial genome sizes are small. 
They’ve got what you’d say is a small genome,  
but then a large pan-genome, which is 
all of the genes they have access to. 
So an E. coli cell might have 3,000 
to 4,000 genes in a single cell,  
but access to 30,000 to 40,000 genes.
What is keeping the metagenome around? 
Why doesn’t everybody just 
converge to this streamlined  
thing that is needed for the current context?
What keeps the metagenome around is the fact that  
different strains of E. coli, or whatever bacteria 
they may be, are living in different environments. 
You could have commensal 
bacteria living in your gut. 
You could have bacteria E. coli living on 
your skin, a very different environment. 
You can then have non-commensal pathogenic 
E. coli which are behaving differently again. 
They can differ in 50% of their genome.
You’ve got all of these things going on  
side by side and they can all 
borrow genes from each other. 
This is within the same species, 
whatever species exactly means with  
bacteria, it doesn’t quite have a meaning.
This is the dynamic of bacterial evolution. 
They retain small genomes with 
access to large pan-genomes,  
and they’re forever borrowing, matching and so on.
They effectively remain competitive by keeping  
their own genome pretty small.
Eukaryotes threw all of  
that out and got larger genomes.
Then the question is, if you try to do  
that with a large genome, a eukaryotic-sized 
genome and then you go on picking up little  
bits of DNA from the environment—the chances 
of you replacing the right gene gets lower. 
It just becomes less and less 
efficient the bigger your genome is. 
By the time you get to eukaryotes, 
they have a large genome. 
Why do they have a large genome?
I would say it’s because you acquired this  
endosymbiont, they become the mitochondria.
Now you have a lot more energy available. 
There’s all kinds of reasons why 
eukaryotes will tolerate a larger genome. 
But the bottom line is you’ve got the energy to do 
something with it which bacteria never really had. 
Now lateral gene transfer is just not good 
enough to maintain this larger genome. 
You’re going to have to do 
something more systematic. 
So you pull on an entire genome, you line 
everything up, you cross over between them. 
Now it’s systematic, it’s reciprocal, 
and you can maintain the quality  
of genes in a much larger genome.
Bacteria never had the need to do that. 
As I was reading your book, 
just to ease my own ignorance,  
I was trying to come up with an analogy.
Please let me know in which ways it’s naive. 
Also thanks for tolerating all 
my other naive questions today. 
Here in Silicon Valley, maybe an analogy that will 
work for us is to think about a GitHub repository. 
I’m already out of my depth now.
Basically you have this code base,  
and you have ways in which you do version control.
The usual way this is done, and this may be  
analogous to sexual recombination, is that 
somebody makes what is called a new branch. 
In that branch, they might make 
changes which are organized next  
to the function that they’re trying to change.
When the maintainer is looking at the code, they  
can see what the original code was at this point.
Here’s the modification to that point of code,  
and you see the diff, and then you can 
merge it back if it seems sensible. 
The analogy here might be sexual recombination 
that’s organized along the relevant gene. 
You see this allele, you see that allele.
Evolution here is a maintainer which is  
then driving one of them to fixation.
The analogy for asexual reproduction,  
cloning with mutation, would be one where you fork 
the repository, then you make a random change. 
You just change some random variable, 
you change a word, you change a bit. 
Almost every single time this will be deleterious. 
And even when it’s not deleterious, 
there’s no merge functionality. 
You’ve got millions of repositories that are 
then spawning millions of other repositories. 
Even if some improvement has been made on one 
of them, there’s no systematic way in which the  
improvements can be merged together.
It sounds quite similar, yes. 
Finally lateral gene transfer. Here 
the analogy might be, you’ve got one  
repository for editing web pages and another 
repository for controlling airline software. 
What you just do is you take a 
random 500-line sequence in this  
web page editing software and you just put it in a 
random point in the airplane management software. 
There’s no systematic organization of, 
"Here’s where the relevant functionality is." 
There is a bit, which is to say with lateral 
gene transfer, you would normally match the  
ends to something you’ve got already.
I don’t know enough about coding to  
give a comparable example, but effectively 
you would be picking up a module which had  
some resemblance in terms of, "Okay, 
it fits into this part of the code." 
So you’d only put that in.
It may or may not be useful there,  
but it’s not just completely random.
It’s plugged into a place where you  
know you have something like that that 
used to be there or could be there. 
So it’s not just random, but 
you don’t know what you put in. 
So then I don’t really have a good intuition 
for why lateral gene transfer does not produce  
similar benefits to recombination.
It’s really just a scaling thing. 
If you pick up a random piece of DNA and 
you’ve got a genome which is 10 times larger,  
how fast can you pick up DNA from the environment?
You’d have to pick up 10 times as much to do that. 
Do you have the capacity to 
pick up 10 times as much? 
There’s also a penalty for doing it, which is 
to say, like a mutation, you’ve got no idea  
what you’re plugging in. It could be almost 
anything. You know where you’re plugging it,  
you’re plugging it in the right place, but 
what’s in that cassette, you don’t really know. 
So the more you do it, the more you 
will degenerate yourself as well. 
There are costs and benefits to doing it.
Maybe to close this off,  what is the  
experiment or method of interrogation, 
which would give us the most amount  
of information about the this story?
There are so many aspects of this story,  
so many possible answers I could give there.
In terms of eukaryotes, giant bacteria, the  
likelihood of life, a lot depends on observation.
We simply don’t know enough about what’s out  
there. So it’s not necessarily experimentation. 
If I assert that giant bacteria are always going  
to have extreme polyploidy with multiple copies 
of their genome, and you find an example that’s  
not like that, my ideas are already breaking up. 
So that’s useful to know. For the origin of life,  
I really wish I could come up with a convincing 
reason why I should go down in a submersible to a  
deep-sea hydrothermal system like Lost City.
I would love to go to Lost City. 
But the trouble is that the ocean chemistry 
is completely different now to what it was 4  
billion years ago. It’s now full of oxygen. 
It’s full of bacteria and things as well. 
But the ocean chemistry is 
different because there’s oxygen. 
There’s no iron, there’s no nickel in the oceans.
You can go to a vent like Lost City and the walls  
are not made of catalytic minerals anymore.
They’re made of aragonite and brucite,  
so calcium carbonate and magnesium 
hydroxides and things like that. 
So the chemistry it can do is very different, 
and there’s lots of bacteria living there. 
I would gain, beyond just the 
sheer amazement of seeing it,  
there’s not a lot it would be able to tell me.
What we’re actually doing is experiments in a  
lab in an anaerobic glove box 
where you exclude the oxygen. 
So you can do these experiments 
reacting hydrogen and CO2. 
How many of the molecules in 
biochemistry can we produce that way? 
It’s slow and laborious, and you get small 
amounts and sometimes you get contaminations. 
Sometimes you have to start all over again.
It’s slow work, but it’s moving forward. It’s  
not just us, either. There are 
other groups around the world. 
Joseph Moran’s group, for example, has done a lot 
of really nice biochemistry along these lines. 
That’s moving forward, but we’re 
talking decades before we’re getting  
to the level where we can say, "Right, we 
can drive flux through all of metabolism,  
and here’s the set of conditions that will do it." 
Certainly some years. There are big crux points,  
like making purine nucleotides where there are 
12 steps in this synthetic pathway, and all the  
intermediates are unstable and break down easily.
It has been done in things like methanol,  
so not in water. In water, stuff breaks down. 
We’re trying to do it. It’s difficult. I believe  
we’ll get there, which is why we’re trying 
to do it, but maybe we won’t, in which case,  
again, the hypothesis is wrong.
You’ve got to wake up every morning  
and think the hypothesis could be wrong.
It’s beautiful, it makes sense, but there are  
so many beautiful ideas killed by ugly facts.
There’s no good believing that you’re right. 
You’ve got to believe you’re 
probably wrong and keep going anyway. 
The other thing which I’m excited about at the 
moment is work on anesthetics and mitochondria,  
it turns out - I heard this from a guy called 
Luca Turin a few years ago now—who pointed out  
to me that anesthetics affect mitochondria.
I had no idea that anesthetics affect  
mitochondria. They do. We’ve been doing 
experiments on it, and it seems not fully  
established yet, but it does seem as 
if their main effect is mitochondria. 
Anesthetics work on all kinds of 
things, including things like amoeba. 
It doesn’t prove anything but it’s beginning 
to say, if you can make an amoeba unconscious,  
then was it conscious before? Not as we 
understand consciousness. The way we would  
understand consciousness is really 
about neural nets, a nervous system,  
and all the complexity of human consciousness.
That’s what we primarily think about. 
But there’s a deep problem which goes back.
It’s the mind-body problem, but it was framed  
by David Chalmers as the hard problem of 
consciousness, which boils down, as my  
understanding of this is, to more or less that we 
don’t know what a feeling is in physical terms. 
You can understand the information 
processing of a neural network. 
But if you feel miserable or you feel pain 
or you feel love or whatever it may be, what  
actually is that in the chemistry of the system?
The problem is that you have all of these neural  
nets firing and some of them are conscious.
We’re aware of what we’re thinking about. 
Others, which seem to have all the same properties 
in terms of the neurons—they have synapses,  
they have neurotransmitters, they depolarize, 
they pass on an action potential—but we’re  
not conscious of it. It’s non-conscious 
information processing. So there’s this  
question. If anesthetics affect things that don’t 
have neural nets, and feelings are something that  
we can’t define in terms of a neural net, could 
it be that feelings are somehow linked more  
broadly to life? So why would they be? The way I 
think about this is as an evolutionary biologist. 
The first question is, would we think that 
the feelings are real? I would say yes. Do  
we think that they evolved? I would say 
yes. I think any evolutionary biologist  
would say yes to those questions.
If it’s real and it evolved,  
then natural selection must be able 
to see it and act on it in some way. 
In other words, there’s something physical 
about it that can be selected for. 
I don’t think there’s anything 
controversial about that statement. 
But if it’s physical and real and has 
been selected on, the implication is we  
should be able to measure it.
It has to offer an advantage  
for selection to act on, and if it’s a 
physical process, it should be measurable. 
But we don’t really know what 
we’re trying to measure here. 
I then revert back to thinking, what would 
a bacterial cell need to do? This is just  
back-of-the-envelope thinking. I immediately 
think about metabolism. What’s the difference  
between the inside of a bacterial cell and 
the outside world? The inside is metabolically  
alive. It’s doing stuff with its chemistry 
all the time, and it’s at a colossal rate. 
A bacterial cell will have about a billion 
reactions every second in this metabolism. 
I’m immediately left wondering, 
how is it all controlled? 
How do you get this cell to have 
a coherent behavior so it decides,  
"I’m going to crawl over there"?
How do you even know what state you’re in? 
How do you synchronize all of this biochemistry?
Probably most people’s answer to that would be  
metabolic regulation of one sort or another.
But that’s not really the driver. 
The driver in the end is 
the thermodynamic drivers. 
How many electrons do you have?
That’s in the form of food  
or NADH or whatever it may be.
How much energy do you have in the form of ATP? 
These are the things that are going to 
synchronize reactions in the same phase. 
The problem there is when you’re dealing with 
molecules, you’re dealing with tens of thousands  
of them, so you’ve got a large statistical 
sampling which is time-consuming to figure out. 
But there is a better way of doing it, which is 
to say, if you’re taking electrons from food in  
NADH and you’re passing them to oxygen, but 
you’re generating a membrane potential and  
that’s driving ATP synthesis, you can measure 
the rate of change and the membrane potential  
and the fields that would be generated, 
electrostatic and electromagnetic fields. 
That’s going to give you a handle on your 
state, on your metabolic state in relation  
to the outside world. Is there enough food 
there? Is there enough oxygen there? Is it  
too hot? Is there a virus? Do I have enough 
iron to be able to do all these reactions? 
You’ve got all these potentially conflicting 
feedback loops, and you’ve got to make a decision. 
Just thinking loosely about how a bacterial cell 
is going to behave, you find that you’re already  
framing it in terms of, as an entity, as a cell, 
it’s got to make some decision about what to do. 
It’s got to integrate all this information 
and make a coherent decision as a self,  
as an entity. Is that free will? Probably 
not in any way that we recognize it,  
but it makes a decision in relation to its 
environment, and the outcome is survival or not. 
What I think a feeling is then is effectively 
the electromagnetic fields generated by membrane  
potential, which is telling you what your 
physical metabolic state is in relation  
to the environment you’re in.
That leads me to a question. 
If consciousness is somehow about mitochondria, 
are the mitochondria in that sense just really  
simply an ATP-generating engine, and you 
interfere with the way they make ATP and  
so anesthetics work by effectively giving you 
an energy deficit so the brain closes down? 
That would be dull if it were true, but it 
would be useful to know if it were true. 
Much more exciting would be, do mitochondria 
generate the kind of fields that I was talking  
about in bacteria that are giving some indication 
of your status in certain mitochondria, certain  
neurons, and the anesthetics interfere with that?
That would be magical if that were true. 
That would be a whole new direction 
of research, which would be fantastic. 
It’s very difficult to measure fields.
It’s very easy to measure artifacts  
that you don’t know what you’re really doing.
We need more physicists working in this area to  
do the hard calculations, and we need more data.
Is it really just in one of these respiratory  
complexes, complex I?
So there’s lots of  
standard molecular biology that we can do.
It’s beginning to point to this idea that yes,  
there’s something going on about the 
way that complex I works which may  
link to generating fields that may link to how 
anesthetics work. That’s just fun. The thing  
that’s great about science is it’s really fun.
It’s one thing I’m always trying to get across  
to the people in my lab. You can’t forget the fun. 
If it becomes drudgery, then you best go because  
you’ll make much more money somewhere else.
You’ll have a better life somewhere else. 
But if what you really care about is the 
science and the experiments, it’s got to be fun. 
You’ve got to really enjoy 
wanting to go and do that. 
I have to say, one of the great 
things for me is it’s always been fun. 
It’s been great to vicariously get a sense 
of that feeling from reading your books. 
Thank you.
For the audience, this conversation has been  
most coupled with Nick’s book, The Vital Question.
I would recommend getting that if you want to  
better follow the argument here.
There’s way more detail there  
that would be helpful.
One, this is a thing I was  
telling you earlier, it fills a niche of books 
which, unfortunately, there are just very few of. 
There are textbooks where you can spend 
2,000 pages learning about molecular biology. 
But a layperson who’s curious is just 
practically not going to get a chance to do that. 
On the other end, there are what are 
basically just anecdotes about scientists  
or anecdotes about the history of science.
This one discoverer was really mercurial,  
and here’s how he ran his lab, and 
here’s how his parents were like. 
But it never really talks about 
the actual relevant science. 
A book like this actually does 
fill the explanatory middle. 
Thank you. Physicists are very good at writing 
books about the big questions of the universe. 
There’s a large readership for having 
your mind blown by a book that you’re  
not going to understand everything 
because you know it’s difficult. 
How do we know anything at all about 
the Big Bang or how black holes work  
or background radiation or whatever it may be?
With life, the origin of life or the trajectory  
of life on a planet, and whether we 
get complex life inevitably or whether  
we’re going to get stuck with bacteria in most 
places, these are big universe-sized questions. 
There’s not many people writing about them and 
trying to take you to the edge of what we know  
in the way that the physicists very often do 
and just saying, "Well, here’s how I see it. 
Here are the questions through my eyes."
You’ve got to try and be honest and say, "Okay, I  
see it this way, other people see it differently."
By the way, the fact that LLMs exist has made the  
process of reading a book like this 
much more feasible and productive. 
I had a book club with a couple of my friends. 
We’re not biologists. We’re laypeople to this  
audience. I do encourage people for a book 
like this to see if you can form a book club  
or something and just talk to LLMs a bunch 
because there’s just a bunch of extremely  
basic remedial chemistry and biology that we were 
able to recapitulate with the help of the LLMs. 
This whole thing of, "Why is the CO2 and H2 
reaction incentivized when one side is alkaline  
and one side is acidic in this early environment?"
You just go through the  
remedial chemistry with the LLM.
Yes, I did my best to explain it in the book,  
and it seems that I didn’t do a great job of it.
There’s so much detail, and you can’t avoid that  
because it’s there in the questions.
This is a problem with biology,  
it’s incredibly complex.
Physicists look at biology  
and they think it’s just too hard to explain, and 
biologists have got all of this terminology and  
often get lost in the terminology.
I find myself, by nature,  
trying to find simple common denominators.
That lends itself then to writing about them. 
I probably oversimplify all the time, or 
maybe I fail and don’t simplify it enough. 
But you wrestle with it and 
you try and make it work. 
It’s genuinely interesting for me to talk 
to you and the other guys in the book club  
to see where you were struggling with it.
I will build this into the next time I’m writing  
a book and try to figure out how I do that better.
Nick, this has been great. Thank you for the guide  
through both the remedial biology and chemistry, 
but also through many of the most interesting  
questions that you could ask about life.
Been great fun. Thanks a lot.
