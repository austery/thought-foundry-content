Let me tell you a story.
This story begins in the summer of 2008.
It's one of those scorching summers
where everything stops
and time itself seems suspended.
I'm 11 and sitting in front
of the computer for days on end,
melting into my chair.
Somehow my dad has found this website
that he claims is this cool,
new virtual-reality experience.
And I'm 11, which means
I still trust my dad.
So I hop on this site, right?
It's called ExitReality,
which is exactly what I want to do,
because it's 42 degrees outside
and there's no air con in our apartment.
If you know what Second Life is,
it's kind of like that.
You can make your own avatars
in the most rudimentary 3D graphics
I have ever seen in my life.
And then supposedly you can meet with
and talk to other avatars
in this endless expanse
of digital landscape
engulfed in a permanent sunset.
But because it is 2008,
everything freaks out
when you press any button,
and the lag is enough
to give anyone anxiety.
I mean, I already had anxiety
as an 11-year-old,
so it made me want to literally die.
But I persevered even though
there's nary a soul in sight.
I key-smashed my way through
pixelated deserts and abandoned streets.
And then, in the corner of my screen,
something appears.
Someone appears.
Their avatar is wearing
a leather jacket and a mohawk.
So I approached them and I'm like,
"Hey, nice mohawk."
Once again, I'm 11,
so please withhold your judgment,
I'm begging you.
We start chatting
and he tells me his name is Tommy,
and then he asks "ASL?"
Which, of course, means
age, sex, location.
And obviously I'm like,
"17, male, Canada,"
even though I'm an 11-year-old boy
living in northwest Sydney.
(Laughter)
We added each other on MSN,
and we start talking for hours a day.
I'm talking hours since both of us
are horny teens or tweens, in my case,
with absolutely nothing better to do.
He tells me his favorite band
is Death Cab for Cutie,
and I'm like, "Oh my God! Same!"
Even though the only
thing on my iPod is Coldplay.
(Laughter)
And then suddenly, we fall out of contact.
I'm not sure how it happened,
but it was devastating.
Pulverizing.
One day we were talking for hours
and the next we just weren't?
My first real heartbreak,
though certainly not
my last online boyfriend.
Now you might be wondering
why I’m telling you this story.
And it's not just because I love
embarrassing myself on stage.
Tommy, if you're listening,
please DM me, I'm desperate.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm telling you this story
because I know you have a similar one.
Especially if you also grew up
in the days of the early internet, right?
Maybe you also got your heart broken
by some guy you'd never met.
Or maybe you were less dramatic than I was
and just made a friend on Club Penguin.
Or God forbid, Habbo Hotel.
What I'm saying is this:
we should return to the days
of the early internet,
the Wild West of the internet,
where everything felt a little looser,
a little jankier,
a little more spontaneous,
where you, too, could meet
the love of your life
and get ghosted as an 11-year-old.
(Laughter)
Where discovery still felt possible.
Here's the thing.
The internet, as it is right now,
is more restricted than ever, right?
More corporate, more buttoned up,
more difficult to find things outside
of what we actually want to see
and what's fed to us algorithmically.
I'm an internet culture writer,
and my screen time is 12 hours a day,
which means I'm clinically insane.
But even if you use the internet
like, a normal amount,
I'm sure you'll have noticed
that the internet today
is a very different place
to what it was five, 10, 15 years ago.
The internet, as it is right now,
is both vaster and harder
than it ever has been.
If you're on TikTok,
which I think most of you are,
you'll know that micro trends pop up
at the speed of light,
then disappear into the ether,
never to be spoken of again.
As an experiment,
I wrote down a list of things
that were going viral on TikTok
about a month ago
while I was writing this talk, right?
Here's that list now.
"The Hunger Games," OK.
Vodka pasta sauce.
Flavored water, "WaterTok"
and unicorn syrup.
Being a "la la la girl"
versus being an "OK, OK, OK girl."
I mean, none of these words
are in the Bible, right?
If you cast your mind back even further,
the trends become even more meaningless.
I'm talking "coastal grandma aesthetic."
I'm talking "frazzled English woman."
I’m talking the return of twee,
pasta chips, whimsy goth,
dark academia, Barbiecore.
What do these words even mean?
(Laughter)
We are cycling through content
at such a velocity
that things become old news
the second they hit the feed.
Even me standing here right now,
telling you that things
are happening faster.
You guessed it, that's old news too.
To quote one famous meme,
“Everything happens so much.”
All of this means
that it's harder to see the things
that we actually want to see.
We're losing control, this is not new.
But what if there was a solution?
What if we could turn back time?
What if we could bring back
some of the features
that made the early internet
so utopian, so lawless,
so full of spontaneous connection
and random experimental zeal?
Well, we can.
So the first solution is the galaxy
brain solution, of course.
It's to repurpose our existing platforms
into spaces that feel
like the early internet again.
For the past couple of years,
I've been turning to niche Facebook groups
as replacements for the early
internet forums of the 2000s.
I know I’m going to sound like the world’s
oldest zoomer right now.
But back in my day,
we had these forums with message boards
where you could message people
about your specific interests,
things like Fall Out Boy
and other emo bands,
countercultures and various subcultures,
PlayStation games, etc, etc, etc.
For the past decade or so,
a smorgasbord of Facebook groups
have popped up kind of in their place.
They act very similarly to these forums.
There are groups
for public transport stans.
There are groups for architecture heads
who just really love stairs.
There are groups for sharing
disgusting photos of terrible food.
I mean, there is a group for everyone, OK?
There is a group called
Subtle Asian Traits
that many of you might have heard of,
and it's literally just a group
about being Asian.
And it has two million members,
making it one of the biggest
Facebook groups, right?
Now is the peak time of absolute chaos.
We are living in a time when everyone,
even your aunt's friend who keeps
sending you minion memes,
has left Facebook.
Which means the only people
left in these groups
are truly the most desperate,
the most committed, the most insane,
the people who have thrown
all caution to the wind
and said, "Who cares,"
to any given conventions of social media.
These spaces are completely
shielded from the frenetic,
demanding nature of online life today.
You can choose whether to post or not,
whether to engage or not,
whether to take things further or not.
You most likely won't know
anyone else in these groups.
There are hardly any celebrities
either, in these groups,
no one's in it to be seen.
Being in these groups
is truly like experiencing
the last, almost, utopia online.
Now there is also an easier solution,
but you need to bear with me, OK,
because I know it sounds super dumb.
The solution is to talk to your friends.
And I promise I don't mean this
in a kind of "get off your phones,
we live in a society" kind of way, OK?
Promise.
I mean, talking to your friends
and asking them
what they're listening to,
what they're consuming,
what they've come across on their feeds.
The worst thing about the algorithm
is that it's so tailored to us
that it can feel inescapable.
But the best thing about the algorithm
is that it's so tailored to us
that no two feeds are the same.
Your friend is listening to a song
that you would have never encountered.
Your parents are on a side of YouTube
that you didn't even know existed.
Your aunt's friend is still
sending you minion memes, OK?
I want every person in this room
to try one thing after this.
Open up your phones, you have permission,
open any app
and show the person next to you
the first thing on your feed.
You might be surprised at how strangely
vulnerable the experience is
and also how surprising the results are.
I mean, this is how I found out
that my partner's TikTok feed
was 90 percent musical theater content,
which made me question
all of my life choices.
But ignoring that,
looking at your phone
and looking at someone else's feed
can help us bring back
the randomness of the early internet.
Think back to me and Tommy, for example.
What we shared was a random,
fleeting encounter which couldn't
have happened anywhere else but online
or at any other time
but the early internet.
That phase might be long gone,
but we can still bring back
the emotional high
of spontaneity, of discovery.
So go forth and be crazy again.
Go and have your heart broken by some guy
who lives three continents away from you.
Go and discover a corner of the internet
previously hidden from you.
Go and be a tween online again,
and go and turn the clock back to 2008.
(Applause)
