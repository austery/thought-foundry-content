>> in This hand
>> in this hand or the neck
>> I was like 612 that's pretty violent.
>> 612 is violent.

>> J I think the best best part of this is that it was not his birthday and there we sang him happy birthday. His birthday is a month later and there was a guest there who it was his actual birthday watching us [laughter] celebrate your not birthday. That's true.
>> That is the true sign of a hijack somebody. What do you say to your sons before you give them $60,000 worth of clothes? Are you like, "My buddy bought me a new wardrobe and I don't want it and this is for you."
>> He said, "My buddies bought all these clothes for me. Stupid idiots." [laughter]

>> J's the one who churns the butter.
>> True. Someone's got to churn the butter.
>> There's people milking the cow. We're at the home game, but Jal turns the butter.
>> No, no. I swear to God, I'm at the home game and I see this GoFundMe page. like, "Hey, invest in our company, whatever." I was like, "I don't know. Crowdfunding, whatever."
>> So, I'm like, I'm trying it out. I'm like, "What should I do?" And I'm like, "Well, Phil Helmouth is wearing um a tracksuit that literally has tears in it. It's so old. It's like fraying."
>> Yes.
>> So, I just put up a um help fund a new tracksuit for Phil H. I took a picture of his fraying, you know, classic Adidas tracksuit. And instantly $2,000 comes in from the poker community.

>> Here, I I I will tell you because I don't I don't really care that much to to hold it back, but
>> they say that should be in the middle.
>> Phil will never play a three street hand. So you have to reduce you have to figure out the mechanics that gets him most of the chips in in a two street hand.
>> Oh wow.
>> So
>> he'll never he'll never just you can look at any hand.
>> It's totally totally uh press and so you check. Now you reduce it to a two street hand. You min bet the turn. Sometimes he'll pop you.
>> Wow.
>> I almost popped.
>> So if I'm bluffing three streets if I'm not two.
>> No. No. Helm has this very specific thing where he just he just will not play three street hands.
>> Right. Right.
>> There's a lot of does.
>> I've noticed that. No.
>> Yeah. Keeps it small. He likes to keep it small.
>> Unlike
>> King made it too.
>> Oh, Keing made it to two. Sorry, I was going to raise.
>> It's the home game. You're allowed to raise if you want your mouth.
>> It's okay. Just going to be respectful.
>> I think fundamentally there's two two types. One person looks for reasons to fold and one person looks for reasons to call. Right.
>> You and I are opposites on that.
>> I'm definitely the person who looks for reasons to call. For sure. Uh-huh.
>> You don't say. I concede. [laughter]

>> Yeah, I think it's got to at least be several thousand that were just like
>> there's poker groups that are popping up in the in the bay because
>> Oh, man. Several thousand what they started, I think. Yeah.
>> A way underestimation.
>> Yeah, that's at least a couple hundred thousand people have come in because of these guys.
>> Yeah, it's amazing, man.
>> Okay, I'll go all in.
>> Hold up.
>> Yikes.
>> Reedberg's always dangerous. always dangerous. You're like the the quiet killer at the poker table.
>> Wow.
>> Every time
>> I needed a club. I had the ace of clubs blocker.
>> It's like a perfect fluff card for me.
>> I don't think I've ever seen Dave have a losing session ever.
>> I've had losing. I'm down to
>> Oh, yeah. I know. I've never I've never seen it. No, he didn't lose any other year. And then this is the first year.
>> This is the first year I'm losing. You're right. Yeah.
>> Yeah. And I don't know why.
>> Play once.
>> I didn't play a lot.
>> He's played like seven six times with us. He he's been a little bit like he's used to sitting down and having the deck smash him. He doesn't know what to do when doesn't have any hands.
>> I noticed that.
>> He works his bicep.
>> I really enjoyed that one tournament. I played that I played that $10,000 World Series tournament.
>> I've never heard that one. [laughter]
>> Um what was that? We all played the World Series 10,000 buying.
>> Oh yeah, that turbo.
>> The turbo. That was super fun, man.
>> 61212.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. You guys came in for that. the the 10,000
>> that honestly I enjoy that.
>> [ __ ] if we launch allin tournament series as our adviser, our top adviser and then heating as our second most important adviser, what would you guys advise us to do with our
>> say there's no amount
>> I'd say
>> we need professional sky youth for any amount he wants basically.
>> He's the biggest influencer in the game. That's all. No, no, but we we need advice from tournament experts like
>> look everybody one thing that I would say is tournaments right now in my opinion it's like they're they're hurting hurting cattle into a like at a farm. In my opinion like players are kind of treated like you guys will do whatever we want you to do because we know you will. So they just kind of treat the mainstream player pretty bad in tournament stops. So I think like starting earlier, having a nice lunch break, letting them go home at a recent at a decent time like rather than just like
>> that would go that would get me to play a couple.
>> Yeah. This is why you like Triton. Is Triton different?
>> Triton plays late, but they give you a super ultra like VIP experience.
>> Uh I still wish that they would shut things down earlier, but those guys don't really
>> work like that. They just play all day every day and the end of the day you have to cater to what they want. But like uh
>> oh
>> what do we got? Beautiful
>> 82
>> 82 that JCO J tomorrow Gil Labbert is hosting the one drop at noon by
>> Yeah you were telling us that
>> I had a really good
>> it's going to be a fast
>> Oh my god I was dead.
>> I would play that. Oh,
>> no. [snorts] 90% you can donate. Like I'll if I win, I'm going to obviously donate
>> probably all of it. At least half. Donate to
>> How much is the buy in?
>> $5,000 buying. Great
>> at noon. And they're going to they're going to end it quickly. We need to do a good group of people.
>> But you're doing live.
>> We want to do the most elite poker tournament ever with the highest end. So would poker players
>> 816.
>> Yes.
>> 816.
>> Would Let me ask you one question though. Um, would poker players be willing to pay to play in a tournament, to play in an elite kind of environment?
>> I Yes, I think absolutely. I think
>> even professional poker players, they lean towards good experiences. They go to venues that make them happy when they wake up and grab breakfast or take a walk outside. Like a few of the stops that you play internationally, they feel like poker prison. It's like the only thing that exists is a poker. You just get depressed. Like, why am I here? I don't want to be here. So, I think have it at a great venue where there's stuff for people to do outside of poker. Have reasonable hours for the tournament. Make it more experience-based than just poker. Like, so people are actually enjoying themselves.
>> And the thing is, if you want it DJ,
>> bestie hand,
>> if you want it DJ, like there's a casino. Like, you can bag your chips up and go DJ. Like, if you want more time to gamble, like you can do that.
>> I would say that these guys and us, we all like two-day tournaments. Like, let's get the final table on day two. I mean, that's just that's
>> every Triton tournament is a two-day tournament,
>> right? Even King might be able.
>> My biggest issue with tournaments is there's too much skill involved. I'd like to figure out a way where it's more luck, you know.
>> Well, Triton's fast schedules or fast structures really give me three cards. I don't know.
>> Have you seen how many randoms went tournament skating?
>> Yeah.
>> Faster structures they they [laughter] you know
>> four three.
>> Yeah. offsuit jack like a [ __ ] ding-dong ships it with the offsuit jack which is the right thing to do.
>> There's a lot of luck involved in tournaments and
>> I'm only playing the players.
>> I'm really just being silly.
>> I could have had that ace, bro. What else would I have done on the button?
>> I had four five. I was about to raise. I was about to three bet. You would have isolated.
>> I had a king. Actually, if you bet small, you would have wrote me into that hand. I wanted to take it down early cuz all I'm playing for is second place right now. I know one of these idiots pros is going to win first. All I have to do is
>> just get lucky and double my money.
>> It would be impossible for me to win a 30-minute tournament. Jason,
>> what is this?
>> Talking about having a chance.
>> Yeah.
>> I just need to get lucky.
>> I think the blinds have to go up next hand cuz
>> correct. Yeah, there's no way this is going to finish if we
>> By the way, good food when people are playing like an actual offering that isn't discussing.
>> I think
>> Play your hand.
>> What's the blind schedule? It's like
>> 32. Um,
>> we'll go 1.
>> Maybe we go two, four.
>> Oh, can we play a bomb pot?
>> This This isn't fast enough for you.
>> Well, I'm just wondering about
>> playing three hands a level.
>> Why don't we add a bomb pod to this? [laughter]
>> I'm not even kidding.
>> One level was two hands.
>> Why don't we play bomb pot? What time are we supposed to go on stage?
>> Can we rotate a bomb pod? I check.
>> Is it 1:30?
>> Oh [ __ ] What happened? Is it just me and Helmu?
>> Me and Helmu?
>> Yes. Catch up. I think we just make it a $1,000 bump for the rest of the way.
>> We could also just like play until
>> No, you guys have to leave and then we just all in dark and see who wins. I mean,
>> this is frustrating. I have a pair
>> 6K. He would bet 4K if you
>> If you could give us a longer speech before you fold, that would be great. Thanks. [laughter] I took 11 seconds.
>> Literally four 4 second levels. This guy's taking a 30 minutes.
>> He's like, "Guys, you're not going to believe this, but I I got a piece of the flop."
>> What are we at? 4,08.
>> Let me make it about me.
>> They call that funeral for your cards, right?
>> Yeah. He's literally giving a eulogy for his body.
>> I mean, I took 11 seconds.
>> We have 38 minutes. Everybody like
>> I took 11 seconds to idiots. They really want to find a way to make
>> Can you guys put a crafts table in the corner?
>> Yeah. while we're playing.
>> I actually am a big fan of that.
>> I have a Wouldn't that be great?
>> A cold brew out there. Would you mind asking to bring my cold brew in?
>> We had fun playing Bakarat
>> on the table from Starbucks right there.
>> Bakarat is more my speed.
>> You and me and we had uh we had some of our
>> regulars. I've never played Bakarat. I'd like to do that. The shrimp.
>> Thank you.
>> Oh, you're too kind.

>> Go for it. Should be a hero.
>> Thank you.
>> I have you beat.
>> Just uh pour this half into another cup. I'm going to split it with [ __ ] Guy, too. [laughter]
>> I would have called you too for the kids.
>> Oh, is what Freeberg chickening out and trying to sit out a couple of rounds to try to eek out second place?
>> That's typical. Yeah.
>> So, are we going to talk about Alan Keating almost beating up the guy last night?
>> Hold up. What? You almost beat somebody up last night
>> in carbone.
>> No way.
>> He smacked his hand on the table and said enough.
>> The all the plates on the table did the little like one inch

>> We could do like a some random games that none of us have ever played before.

>> Oh my god.
>> Please hold up.
>> I got the six of the ace of the choppy.
>> WOW. [screaming]
>> YES, YES, YES. YES, YES, YES. OH MY GOD. So great.
>> What a call by me.
>> Choppy. Choppy.
>> Wow.
>> Why do I not get rewarded for such [ __ ] stellar play?
>> Unbelievable. It
>> was a really good call.
>> Nothing better than Helmuth not winning. There is nothing better [laughter] than that. Not
>> I do feel that way. Yeah.
>> It's so great when he doesn't win.
>> Yeah.
>> When he had when he what is it? 15. He turns the
>> 153. Okay.
>> Oh, you don't like it when I do that, do you?
>> For the viewers, one thing that they
>> I thought if you had a pair, you would call
>> I have to move in with ace high there. I think one thing the viewers should know about poker is all the money in the middle makes it so that you don't have to get your money in in front for it to be profitable. That's like an important thing for people to understand. Sometimes even if you know your beat, if you're being laid a price to gamble, sometimes you have to gamble and it's better than folding. That's something and I think there's a lot of analogies to that
>> in business. Yep.
>> Life decision making.
>> Yeah. Like sometimes you know you have the worst of it but you got to run it. Having the best hand is kind of lame to be honest. [laughter]
>> It's rare. It doesn't happen often some nights happens a lot, but
>> you hold them. It's hard to make a good hand.
>> That's why it's the best game.
>> PLO, I feel like it's been sold as if it's an action game. But you come into the hand with king 10, 74.
>> You're facing king, queen, jack, 10, and pocket kings and aces. So many hands.
>> There's no board where you're
>> dominate. Yeah.
>> Or your advantage.
>> You can't catch.
>> Short-handed. It's
>> I said all in.
>> True.
>> Short-handed. It's
>> true.
>> I'm going to need a little advice. [ __ ]
>> I said all in.
>> No, I He went all in. But
>> uh I think it's been sold as a gambler's game when
>> this is going to be a big decision for me. How much chips did he have left? All in.
>> He could have ace king here. He could have king queen here.
>> He's got like 193 or something. I think this would be a very tough decision for me.
>> He doesn't have aces, but he could have ace king. He could have king queen.
>> Wow. Do I want to go out?
>> Could he do that with queens or tens? He knows I could have a king. Really difficult decision. Could have. Could he have any of those set of sevens? No.
>> I'll just go grab one.
>> He did raise pre flop. He could have ace kings. sugar non- sugar things or whatever sweetened.
>> Nice to be here.
>> Okay, I'll take
>> So many chips left.
>> Any of them.
>> Thank you.
>> All right, I'm going to lift if I fight another day.
>> Run it. Run it. Rabbit hunt. Let's see it.
>> He's going back door regardless.
>> World's easiest call.
>> NO.
>> OH MY GOD. [screaming] WHAT?
>> OH, he he folded.
>> He wanted the best hand by all. I knew it was coming. He's running so hot right now.
>> I knew it was coming.
>> You avoided the pain.
>> Wow.
>> I was like, you know what? I could live to fight another day here.
>> That's second level play right there.
>> Fear rewarded. [laughter]
>> Second level.
>> The pros would have snapped the money.
>> Fear rewarded.
>> No, I mean, he's playing against me, so I would put him on a better hand playing against me. He knows I'm, you know, I play a tighter range of hands. So,
>> good read.
>> Yeah,
>> it was the wrong read. King N. You're right. King nine of clubs was a little stronger than [laughter] I thought. Pre flop.
>> Yeah. He flips that over and you're like,
>> I was like, "Oh god, that's gross."
>> Right. [laughter]
>> Oh boy.
>> That was a good hand. I like that hand.
>> Run.
>> We got to get sacks out here.
>> Mhm.
