we have something in uh Norway called the spending rule hling reg which you first as a brilliant student of Economics uh worked on then as a minister of finance and the Prime Minister and so on and it's a rule which tells how much of the Norwegian sov wealth fund can be spent every year to support the budget and it's really been a Cornerstone in the economic planning in this country now what what inspire you to create this rule it was the understanding that Norway was going to get a lot of revenues from the oil and gas and much bigger revenues than we expected um um and therefore when I was prime minister in 2000 uh then we actually had only net oil revenues only for a few years the first net oil revenues came to Norway in 1996 in the beginning they were quite small uh then it was obvious that we needed we needed some way of uh deciding how much we could spend and we were very afraid of uh what we referred to as Dutch disease uh to spend too much um and therefore we started partly in the kind of academic but also then a political discussion on how to establish a fiscal rule for how much of the oil revenues we could spend and the purpose was actually twofold one was to ensure that uh not only Our Generation but also future Generations get the benefit uh of the oil and gas resources that we have found on thean Al shelf uh that's kind of long-term perspective the other reason to uh establish the fiscal Rule and the and the pension fund um was to ensure that we could uh stabilize theion economy to separate earnings from spending and prevent overheating of the uh economy and therefore we we established a pension fund and the first money was allocated to the pension fund in 96 but perhaps as important was this fiscal rule where we decided that all the oil and gas revenues uh was going to go into norian pension fund and then that the only thing we're going to spend was the financial return uh which we estimate to 3% in yield terms per year as as an average and therefore the fiscal R says that we should only uh spend on average uh the fiscal uh return 3% estimated um uh and um and that has served Norway very well it's Quite a feat to manage to get um political consensus around the spending of such vast resources uh and probably one of the successes of uh well one of the main successes of the fund uh has it worked the way you thought yes and if anything it worked even better uh um U because uh partly because the fund has become much bigger than we expected for many reasons oil and gas production at noran on Shelf has been bigger prices have been higher and we also have good Investments because of people like like you have been able to manage the fund in a very good way so the combination of all these things have made the fund much bigger and therefore also the fiscal rule more important if you had at the time when the fiscal rule was made had also made a rule for how much uh in total could the fund contribute to in percent of the budget what do you think that percentage would have been I think it would have been lower than the current percent which I think is now yeah 25% or roughly almost one one quarter of the norian state expenditure or state budget is financed by the return from the oil fund or from so instead of 25 what do you think he would have been if you I am not able I know but but but but but then I think it's important in way as I'm not able to give you an exact number but I think it's also important to understand that there are concerns and I'm careful be going too much into that debate because that's a very Norwegian debate and I and I'm careful being too specific on issues I not worked so close with over the last years but but I think the idea back in 2000 when we made the fiscal rule was in a way that this was going to it could last forever because in one way NATO has sorry Norway has spent zero of the oil uh revenues the only thing we have spent is the fiscal return on the oil revenues and um and and of course that can last forever uh as long as we have the installment the The Challenge and you know that better than anyone one else is that of course we now have so much our wealth in the stock market then of course there can be big fluctuations uh that can have a impact on the Norwegian economy and that's a new risk which we didn't face at least not in the same way uh uh before um uh so and and I'm always a bit careful um uh changing these kind of fiscal rules to offer because that will undermine The credibility uh perhaps it's better to have an imperfect rule which is credible than to always try to uh run for a more perfect rule but which is um constantly changed that will because this is this is a self-imposed restriction and the biggest success in a way is that a Democratic Society as Norway has been able to handle this enormous amount of cash without spending it m uh uh I remember back in the 1990s when we uh had this discussion and started to invest in in equities and and had the first allocation to the pension fund many experts also economists colleagues of mine said this cannot happen the the the Democratic institutions politicians they will spend if they get the money they will spend so they were actually in favor of reducing the oil and gas production to keep the wealth uh in the continental shelf um and they actually for former Governor norian Central Bank bank har scan he led an expert group and they said it cannot work politician will spend if they get the money we have proven them wrong and that's the biggest success and but but again if you start to change these rules too often you may undermine in a way the the magic of the Line in the Sand which is which is the the fiscal rle I think we can say Well done norian politicians and well done the Minister of Finance and the management and the the the and B and all also have been IR responsible
