Oh Boy Have we been Lucky oil was found in one of the last drills in 1969 and forward thinking politicians they acted such that Norwegian people were the ones that benefited and not only our Generation But The Generations come and in 1990 only si years Prior the first inflow the Norwegian parliament adopt an act that established the Norwegian government petroleum fund it was called at that time That was only si years Prior to the first inflow So the Timing was quite excellent So when the funny when the money started to flow in the organization was just set up ready to invest and since then or go has been to Eh maximize or give the highest possible return for The moderate Risk så det heter fun can endure almost 5 billion croner has been added in the fund since The Beginning That is The Flow of money that has been saved from the revenues for norian sale of oil and gas prod production but most of the fund is return since the first inflow in 96 the fund a Return of 14000 billion kroner including the currency effect of 3000 billion The Return accounts for 75% of the value of the fund including the cur That is fascinating protect the Norwegian mainland economy the fund is only invested outside of Norway So the investments are divided between North America Europe and Asia Oceania primarily 72% of the fund is invested in equities 26% in fixed income and 2% in real estate we have an automatic rule that makes us sell Down or reduce equities St market incre and equi decline to keep the equ por around 70% most the fixed income assets Are Made in develop markets

on fundamental research and These strategies enables us to achieve the Exposure to the Broad equity market expressed in the equity benchmark at the same time increased The Return based on company analysis the security Selection London New York Singapore organ Global Sector teams fus Markets Mars markets and Smalls in Asia all them are in country [Musikk] focused based in the country maning monea fusing fusing India fing Brazil to focusing on Japan small and Korea small et in Europe and Us It's a bit more mixed with both locally based country Focus small managers And Also some region managers and Sector managers The Thing is that we look for specialists that know a few areas very well we have today 110 managers in 50 different cities across the World We strongly Believe in the information advantage of being on the grounders we Seek to find the build portfolios grounded in their extensive local knowledge and research the maintain reg communication with the companies in the portfolios by frequently Visiting on s and not in conferences So our aim is to generate Excess return as of last year we have generated 1.8% annualized Excess Return of the fees since beginning That is 90 billion kron the Fe and over time only Paid 3% in fees that is 80% of access return is kept by n we also believe that the external managers will reduce The Risk of over investments by avoiding certain companies with problematic business models and weak corporate governance in these markets and These markets or These managers they operate in markets with higher Exposure Risk our focus on issues is integrated In The Selection and monitoring for EX before Selected year after that we Send Expectations documents to the managers and discuss the issues with them to ensure that the managers Invest the focus on e Risk they understand what is important to us and That they have that in Mind when they are investing On behalf of Us So the local managers they actually avoided 75% of the companies in their local benchmarks our strategy has Evolved over time with both the with the expansion of the funds universe The F size the Changes in the market environment our approach has always been dynamic and the segments we have chosen to focus on they Have Changed small Focus 200 markets 2005 reg managers Man [Musikk] great Deal uncertainty that may be better assessed through additional research we expect Changes continue going forward as we know There will be Changes in opportunities What has not ch Is that all are only They are based on Deep fundamental research and they are all on segregated accounts That is the are trading on our book in our name There are several reason for Why we do that first that we see at all times what they buy and sell so we know The Risk of each of the portfolios the holdings in each of the portfolios Changes of each of them and the combination do that sa investment Universe Us IF anything there is absolutely No Doubt Who owns The asss because they are trading on our book you may have seen the movie already book Mone ball movie with Brad Pitt as Billy Bean Who is building a team of baseball players for oak a they can't compete on salary do the s process are constr Team Bas players aref man like week sess for EX We don't ask for look at higher managers Because We Believe The expected research expected performance will be good not that have good performance in the future in the history eh an historic performance May hide certain factors whether for example good performance was driven by certain analysts Who used to work in the team fur need long History to figure out performance is driven by skill and very frequently we don't have history and second not an investment committee inim that decides Which man that should be should be awarded a mandate eh but an individual portfolio manager Bim or we have said that employing external managers is an investment decision and investment decisions should not be made in group settings So we are eight people in the team selecting managers and each of us in the team are forf managers Who are responsible for Selection and termination Within each over one dedicated decision maker for mand We don't use consultants to assist us several of them in knowledge eh several managers but we are in a different position than many of the other clients so we have to decided to dig Deep over s to know every aspect of the manager portfolio philosophy and the interaction in the team Because we are striving to create a portfolio of different portfolio managers that fit Well together with different Focus and different Investment universes So what do we do we follow quite structured Selection process starts with a short question to Potential managers with questions the organ Teams and the full portfolio Act Back Time Fors in Who as main competitors this information is us to get better insight into additional managers based on that we have huge dataset with Potential managers and can do different analysis on the actual portfolios the Changes when and what been buying eh and differences between each this lead to short around can meet on s and those Selected for the second third round more extens Operation comp et of Me team to F times before Selection and several of them screen out during the during These meetings while new managers are found and Included in the search each Time Of These meetings doing a lot more analysis on the Changes in the portfolio Potential Changes in the team this is repe continuously all Invest Potential managers we usually Meet the manag three to four times before Selection and Once Per quarter after They are Selected in this meeting we discussed the portfolio individual companies when they met the management of the companies where they misted what they talked about Which ESG issues they discussed What is priced into the company eh why they have a different View from the rest of the market and both companies they are invested in and companies they have decided to stay out of all the meetings with these managers are conducted on site we never meet any managers in our offices and there are several reason for that first Is We prefer the manager to focus on the investments and the portfolio travel around the world to me us the second is that By seeing them on site we can Meet the whole Team Of course is impossible if you Drag them to Norway and the third is that when meeting the managers in a Country We don't only Meet the ones that you have but we meet all the existing And Also Potential managers so we can compare their view on markets and companies so that gives a very good understanding of the managers different views Who thinks differently Than The Rest Who are early or late to investment idees Who are engaged in hing ETC when looking for managers in a certain market we look for a good investment company and a good PF manager with the company experience is return is to individuals and They need organ Can We found smaller Priv organ more often higher access the larg ones and larg ones own by financial institutions i several Reason For That more often better alignment of Interest the portfolio managers the analy customers compensation structure that sort of reflects and strengthen alignment furen Priv own organ better at attracting retaining growing tal teams St and find more frequently focus on Gathering rather return in some the laran differents link different parts financial experience is personal responsibility and personality lead to dent analysis PMS det ownership to the final investment decision avoid investment teams with rigid investment committees and look for organizations we can find clear and individual based decision making the overconfidence in group settings with lack of Quality and seeking unanimity that should be avoided in investment decisions it is very important that the portfolio manager has a strong team around him or her to give input on the stocks to buy and the stocks that he or She should have sold in general just give them a hard time such That they can help him or her to avoid anchoring Bias l aversion Bias and other behavioral traps for EX one managers in Japan they have a war room where views from the team are fled out and opinions are expressed Independent sene in general we Seek to identify that investment Culture ised at all levels sitting down pr desk prefer ear investor We are searching fores and given that we don't look at track record we can look for good Teams and good portfolio managers Else many of the other allat out there and we often find hungry teams focused on showing the world large Potential Cent That they will succeed given the long commitment managers that we select we have time to grow with them for it requires quite Deep eh diligence into why they start The Business and passion for investing compared to the work building organization and Team give them input and discussions types of decision makers forf managers we have chosen to invest with They are quite diverse There are some common characteristics amongs They need to have a creative and distinct View of the world where they Seek different data different interpretations and can put the numbers into context essential to be Curious challenge Convention Wisdom inquisitive and Humble need to be willing to Always look for new information and willing to change One's Mind One PM Sitting on the road cars for a week before investing Another One was sitting in a wheelchair traveling Around the World to make up his own View in general They need to find information through their own analysis market and companies and at the time That Ching market Dynamics m lead to disruption the only information away from is inside information i PM with Golf Clubs in in The Office claiming that the best information that he got was the with theos Golf cour That is one of the shortest meetings I Ever Had the external managers apply huge analytical capacity on a limited number equities Seek to identify companies with attract valuation and of positive ESG progress and These convictions should be reflected in the portfolio we Seek for concentrated portfolios We Believe Selected the best portfolio manager in that specific field and we expect them to take High market Risk to perform the group That is responsible for The Selection termination and ongoing return and Risk There are many more of us in that are involved in monitoring governance compliance internal legal advisers Risk management and measurement Operations internal and external auditors Who regularly go through all over r but fusing more on what we do given that all over mandates are on segregated account we access to all holdings and Changes in the portfolio Daily through database Weil several monitoring Tools on this data That is crucial in monitoring each of the managers Tools performance Risk Trading holding for to Trading anal man buying and selling stock in combination with performance and broker estimates This is put context over discussions with the managers to evaluate They are executing the strategies and philosophies is the PM follow a Momentum player When is he or She increasing the position are the utilizing market volatility to trade the position are they will to be able to rev rev investment thesis and change the portfolio stale portfolios are red Flag and Something that we would investigate further market change quite drastically and we expect over managers to adjust their pfos furthermore this database is stretching back to 1998 Which gives us a huge dataset on when and how they underperform or outperform and how we should think about combining managers increase funding terminate the mandates ETC so our Focus is to optimize portfolio managers based on over knowledge of the portfolio the regular meetings with the managers the analysis of the portfolios the aim is to maximize expected return Per dollar fee and s additional manager May Bring Excess performance but also May Bring Us Closer to indexed portfolio which is just an expensive way of doing it we manag the portfolio quite actively on average we have 14 new and 10 terminations every year 40% of the determinations IS due to significant Changes around the portfolio manager that he or She is leaving expanding the Coverage et CE 40% is due to wrong Selection from us or that we are less convinced about their Excess performance going forward for some Reason and 20% is due to shifting strategy getting out of Sector managers Out Regional managers the shortest We had is Two Weeks That was the portfolio manager that left right after had sign the agreement and the longest is a UK small mandate That We had since 2001 on average hold mandates for bit of 4 years eh average holding of today mandates about between 6 and 7 so we use experts in Selected market segments utilizing Deep fundamental research prefer small and privately owned organizations prefer single PMS versus Team Run portfolios or investment committees we meet the whole organization on site we look for some specific characteristics with manag and the team TH moning process
