MURIEL WILKINS: I think
there's the first place
to start is to be curious.
So you've got to
not just go to what
do I need to do
differently, which
is what most of us who are
extremely action biased will do.
You've got to take a
beat and ask yourself,
what is happening right now?
What are the outcomes
that I'm getting?
Where's the dissonance?
And let me reverse engineer it.
What are the
behaviors or actions
I'm taking that are
leading to the current act,
to the current outcomes?
And then take a
step back from that
and say, what is
the mindset that
is driving that type
of action and behavior?
What are the assumptions
that I'm making, either
about the way that
I need to lead,
about those who I'm leading,
about the context that I'm in,
that are then driving
the current actions?
ALISON BEARD: Muriel, thank you
so much for being with me today.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you.
I'm so delighted to be here.
ALISON BEARD: Let's first
talk about what exactly
a hidden blocker is.
They're hidden because people
don't that they're there,
and they've managed to be very
successful in spite of them?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
So hidden blockers are
beliefs that you hold.
And what is a belief?
A belief is a narrative
that you tell yourself.
It's a story.
It's an assumption.
And so the reason
why they are hidden
is because, while they may
have helped you in the past,
they have become so
habitual that you're not
even aware that they're still
operating in situations where
they actually might not
be as effective as they
have been for you in the past.
ALISON BEARD: If it is
something that's not obvious,
how does it become apparent?
MURIEL WILKINS: It
usually becomes apparent,
because there's some
dissonance between what
you desire in
terms of an outcome
and what you're
actually experiencing.
And so you can have a cue
around that in two ways.
It can be an external cue.
So if you've ever received
some feedback, for example,
and you're like, that feedback
doesn't resonate with me
or that's not the way
I want to be seen,
or your team might
not be performing
in the way you'd
like them to perform.
So there might be
some external cues
that things aren't going the
way that you would like them,
but you can also have
some internal cues.
If you're feeling frustration,
if you're feeling burned out,
if you're feeling some
unease or some malaise
around how you're operating
at work or how you're leading,
then that is also something
you should be listening
to that behind that, might be
a belief or a limiting belief,
or a hidden blocker,
as I call them,
that is getting in your way.
ALISON BEARD: And so
you're an executive coach.
And so how did you
come to understand
that lots of professionals who
are seemingly high powered,
high achieving, are suffering
from these blockers,
and it is preventing them
from getting that promotion
or encouraging their team to
perform as well as they can?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
I mean, really, it
was a parallel path,
I think, on two levels.
So the first level is,
I saw with my clients
that we were very
action oriented
in terms of moving towards
the goals that they had.
And so we were very quick,
if they received feedback
to say, OK, well here's
what you're going to do.
But what I found is that
it wasn't sustainable.
They were able to take the
actions, change the behavior,
but it was short lived.
And so I became curious around
why is it that they still
keep hitting a wall,
even though they might
be successful on the outside.
They may still
get the promotion,
but they were still
facing a level
of frustration, a level
of unease with the way
that they were leading.
That led me to think,
well, what's behind that?
And I then found that, well,
what's driving the behavior
is the belief.
It's our internal
operating system.
So I saw this happen with my
clients, and quite frankly,
I also saw it happen
with myself, where
I kept hitting certain walls,
professionally or otherwise,
and recognized that,
well, maybe I'm
contributing to
them in some way.
And it's not just about
changing what I'm doing,
but it's also about
changing the way
I think about what I'm doing.
ALISON BEARD: So it's
like if you get feedback
that you're a
micromanager, it's not,
OK, how do I stop micromanaging,
it's why do I micromanage.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
What's driving the
micromanagement.
Which is, a lot of
times based on, well,
what are you thinking about
the folks that you're managing,
or what are you thinking about
the work that you're doing,
or what are you thinking
about yourself that's
then leading to that behavior?
And what's interesting,
Alison, is this is nothing new.
It's something that's applied
in a lot of other domains.
You think about health.
You think about weight loss.
People always say you've got to
change your mindset around food
before you can change your
relationship with food,
which then changes the way you
eat and all the rest of it.
Well, then so why can't it
apply to the way that we work
and certainly, the
way that we lead?
ALISON BEARD: So how did
you go about identifying
the most common types of
blockers that people experience?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
So I became curious, again,
around, not only are there
beliefs that might get in
your way, but then I wondered,
are there some that cross
different types of leaders?
So I looked across
over 300 of the leaders
that I had coached
over the past 20 years
and looked to see what evidence
there was around what might
be driving their behavior.
And I wasn't sure if I was
going to find anything,
but lo and behold,
there were seven
that bubbled up to the top.
Now, that's not to say they
are the only beliefs that
might get in your way, but
these were the most common ones
across these leaders that I had
worked with who, by the way,
differed in terms of gender,
in terms of demographics,
in terms of sectors.
So it's pretty agnostic in
terms of where they showed up.
ALISON BEARD: And also, they
differed in terms of level
in the hierarchy.
This can happen to
someone who's very junior,
as well as someone
who's in the C-suite.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, I mean, most
of the folks that I looked
at were, in at very least,
managerial positions,
so they did lead others.
But what happens is they become
more consequential the more
that you're trying
to lead at scale.
So the more that you are going
up through the leadership
pipeline, if you
will, or advancing
in your profession,
the more that there's
a risk of them
getting in the way.
ALISON BEARD: So I want to
clue our listeners in to what
the seven blockers are.
We can't dig into all
of them, but we'll
dig into a few of them.
So the seven are--
I need to be involved, I need
it done now, I'm know I'm right,
I can't make a mistake,
if I can do it,
so can you; I can't say no,
and I don't belong here.
So the I need it done
now certainly resonates
with many people, particularly
in today's climate
where everything is moving
at such a fast pace,
we need a result. So talk
about how that manifests itself
and the damage
that it can cause.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, so the
way that it manifests itself,
quite frankly, it may
not manifest itself
in terms of you feeling an
internal queue of oh, my gosh,
I have this belief, and it's
having dire consequences on me,
but it certainly has
consequences on everyone else.
And the way it shows up
is, it feels like there's
lack of prioritization.
We are equating everything
as important and urgent
at the same time.
It feels like people
are burned out
because they are pulling
all types of things
to be able to get
everything on the list done.
And oh, by the way, it never
feels like anything is done.
It also looks like there's
frequent change happening.
So you're on the change
acceleration wheel
at an organizational
level, which
also, has dire consequences
because the organization may not
be equipped or ready to
sustain that level of change
so frequently.
So there are a number of ways
that it shows up externally.
And quite frankly,
the only person
who feels like they're
benefiting from it
is the leader itself who holds
that belief, because they think
that they are being productive.
But in actuality,
what's happening
is toxic productivity,
which is, when
you're trying to do
things at all costs
or at any cost, which then has
a severe impact on the people
within your organization and
your ability to build capacity
within that company.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And we're going to talk
through the process
for unblocking yourself.
But first, let's dig in
to a few more examples.
I can do it, so you
should be able to too.
That really resonates
with me as a Gen Xer
who is dealing with people from
many different generations, who
operate in a different
way than I do.
It also is a functional thing.
I come from a journalism
background, not a corporate one.
Talk about why, if
that's my blocker,
it could be holding me back.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, so you what's
interesting, all of these
beliefs come from a good place.
The intent is good, and we often
think about that if I can do it,
so can you, is motivational.
If I can do it, little old
me, why can't you do it?
But the assumption there is
that what the person is bringing
to the table is
exactly what you bring
to the table, which
runs completely counter
to Developing People 101.
ALISON BEARD: And then they'll
do it exactly the way--
MURIEL WILKINS: And that
you'll do it exactly--
exactly.
So if we think about
how to develop people,
how to lead change
in an organization,
how to grow capacity, again,
within an organization.
The number one
rule is, you've got
to meet people where they are.
That, even, underlies any
negotiation or any influence.
And so the skill of being able
to meet people where they are
and the mindset to
be able to do that
is what leads to a
lot of effectiveness
in so many different domains.
So if our starting point is no,
meet me where I am, which is,
essentially, what the if I
can do it, so can you says,
then we're getting in our
way of really being effective
in a number of different areas.
ALISON BEARD: And then the third
one I just want to touch on
is fear of making mistakes.
Because I think, particularly,
when you get to a certain level,
you expect that
what you're doing
and that everyone sees
you and looks at you
and expects you to be perfect.
But then I think also,
in times like this
of great economic and
geopolitical uncertainty,
with technological
change, people
feel a little bit paralyzed.
And they definitely are
maybe more risk averse,
because a misstep could
really have dire consequences
for their career.
So talk a little
bit about how you
see this I can't make a mistake
playing out for your clients
right now.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, absolutely.
So the I can't make a
mistake belief really
gets in the way of being
able to move forward.
And what's clear
with my clients who
hold leadership
positions is they
have two mandates,
particularly when
they are leading organizations.
One mandate is they
have to manage risk.
Yes, absolutely.
This is not about being
a reckless mistake maker.
You ought to manage risk.
But there are other mandate is
to move the organization forward
in the strategic direction
that it needs to go in.
We need to get results.
We need to be able to
deliver to whatever metrics
you're looking to deliver to.
The I can't make a mistake
tends to hold that latter part
of the formula back
because we become concerned
about making decisions.
We become concerned about
putting a stake in the ground.
It can lead to changing
course too often,
instead of trying
to follow through.
It can lead to then even not
delegating and building people
from within.
So it just holds us
back from exacting
some of the leadership
responsibilities
that we actually have.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And career wise, you do make the
point that people with blockers
can still get promoted.
They can still rise very
high in the organization.
So for someone who maybe thinks
that some of their blockers
are productive, being a
perfectionist or demanding
urgency, what's the impetus
for doing the work required
to push through them?
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, there
always has to be an impetus.
The change doesn't happen just
from lying around and saying,
oh, maybe today, I'll
exact some change.
So usually, it's
either something
from the outside
that gets imposed.
So a lot of times with the
I can't make a mistake,
as an example, for that
being a hidden belief
is, it causes a
lot of frustration
from stakeholders
your boss, your peers,
those who work for you.
And if you as a leader do not
want to alienate or frustrate
your counterparts or
your stakeholders,
then you decide that you want
to do something different.
So that might be an impetus.
But the other is that, again,
there can be an internal queue.
If it's creating
some angst, if you're
recognizing that you're not
moving forward in the way
that you need to that you're
not performing at the level
at which you would like, or
that your organization is not
moving fast enough.
Then you have to question
what part of that are you
contributing to?
You might not be responsible
for the whole thing,
but you certainly are
responsible for one part of it,
and that can be
driven by how you're
thinking about the actions your
organization needs to take.
ALISON BEARD: So if you're
sensing these things,
either your team is
frustrated or you personally
are like, something
is off, how do you
go about diagnosing what
your specific problem is?
MURIEL WILKINS: That's
when you start to name it.
So the first step is
really even uncovering
that there's some
dissonance and then naming
the belief that is
contributing to the dissonance
that you're experiencing.
That all has to happen before
you do anything differently.
ALISON BEARD: And do you
ever see people struggle
to figure out what it is or
if what it is is pointed out
to them, they push back on it?
MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
Because the belief, in
and of itself, is not bad.
It has helped you.
It's probably what's made
you successful up until now.
But if we really
look at what it means
to be adaptable as
a leader, you've
gotta be able to open
up the aperture and say,
there is a possibility
that what has helped
me may not be helping me now.
And that's when they start
loosening the grip a little bit.
It's also understanding
that you don't
need to get rid of that belief.
I mean, we certainly
don't want to get rid
of the belief of I
can't make a mistake,
because there are certain
points in time where
we need to hold on to that one.
But again, being more
expansive as a leader
and being able to deal
with the complexity
that you're dealing
with is going
to require you to tap
into different mindsets,
the ones that are going to
be effective for that time.
So what it does
is, once a leader
starts understanding that
by exploring and being
able to put that one
to the side for even
a limited amount of time and
exploring other mindsets,
once they start
understanding that that
can be their superpower,
to actually deal
with the complexities of
the times that they're in,
then they recognize that it's
an asset that they can leverage.
ALISON BEARD: And then
most of us would then say,
OK, my problem is that
I'm a perfectionist.
I can't make mistakes, so
let me change that belief.
Why do you have this
middle step that
is about better understanding
what the belief is
before you try to fix it?
MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.
So the first is you
want to uncover it,
then you want to unpack it.
And the unpacking
is, let me understand
why this belief is even here.
In a way, you're befriending it.
Because as I said
before, it's not bad.
It's just not serving
you in this moment.
And if you can't understand
when it is serving you,
when it is not
serving you, you have
a higher risk of repeating it
again in the wrong situations.
So part of that process
is understanding
at what point in your
life, in your career,
in different situations,
did it actually
help you so that you
can assess situations,
Just as we do with a business.
You can assess situations
that you're facing
and be proactive and say,
what kind of belief or mindset
do I need to bring into
this particular situation
to increase the probability
that I will get to the outcomes
that I desire?
ALISON BEARD: So now
can we get to fixing it?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yes.
ALISON BEARD: OK, great.
So you've uncovered,
you've unpacked,
and now, you need to move
forward and change yourself
from someone who thinks
they can't make mistakes
to a different person.
That has to start with
actually just believing
that you can change.
If you've always identified
as a perfectionist,
it's part of your identity, how
do you move to a mode in which
you wouldn't?
MURIEL WILKINS: So it's
so interesting, Alison,
that you're even using the
terminology change who you are.
Because actually, I don't see
this as changing who you are.
And here's why.
I think underlying,
this is people
mistaken that their
beliefs who they are.
All of our beliefs are learned.
They're what we learned
in order to be successful
or in order to survive
or thrive in any context
that we were in early on in life
and as we moved through life.
The key here is
they're malleable.
They are things that
you can change according
to what it is that you
want, rather than react
to the experiences that
you had in the past.
But it doesn't necessarily
change who you are as a person.
If anything, it
expands who you are.
And so when you start seeing
it from that perspective,
I think that that is the mindset
that then leads to more openness
to say, oh, OK, yes, I
can pick up another belief
or I can now start doing the
work in this way, which then
allows you to actually move
into this action phase, which
is, if I pick up this new
belief, if I've reframed it
and I've moved from I can't make
a mistake to we're going to do
the best that we can with
the resources that we have,
or we're going to do
the best that we can
with the information that
we have, then you can say,
OK, well,
what actions align
with that that it
will allow me to get to
the outcome that I want?
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
What are some other
examples of ways to reframe
these unproductive blockers?
So maybe we'll take
some of the others
that we discussed, like,
if I can do it, so can you.
MURIEL WILKINS: So if I
can do it for you-- and let
me just take a step back here.
I think it's very
important that just as you
have to name what the
original belief is,
it's also very important that
people own what the reframe is.
So I can suggest examples,
but at the end of the day,
the work is to say
come up with one
that's going to work for you.
And so the I can do it, so can
you, it's a very simple reframe.
I will meet you where you are.
It's a different starting line.
Doesn't mean that
you're still not holding
the output as critical or
you don't think the task
is important.
You're just taking a
different path to get there.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And what about I
need it done now?
MURIEL WILKINS: I
need it done now,
that's a tricky one
because you have to really
recognize that maybe not--
ALISON BEARD: Sometimes
MURIEL WILKINS:
Sometimes you do.
And in those situations,
the house is on fire.
I need it done now.
I need you to get
out of the house.
But not everything is a fire.
And so it's understanding that
the reframe can be something
like, I need it done
now if it's a priority.
Or I need it done now,
if it's actually urgent.
Or I need it done
now, if it falls
within the parameters of what
we have set as our objectives
for this month, this year.
So there's a filter that's
created around this,
what you have prescribed
as a universal rule, which
then turns it as not universal
across every situation.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
So can you give us an
example of an executive
that you've worked
with or encountered
that has gone
through this process
to turn a hidden blocker into
a more productive belief?
MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
So one of my favorites,
which I talk about,
is one of the
executives I worked
with who, his hidden
belief or hidden blocker
was, I know I'm right.
And what was tricky
about that is,
he actually was right
most of the time.
So a lot of times we
hear, well, maybe you
could hear a different solution.
Actually, the folks who
have that as a belief,
they have evidence that a
lot of times, they are right.
And they have this uncanny
ability to see around corners.
The issue is that there
was then a consequence
to that in terms of the way
that he demonstrated it.
He was alienating a lot
of his stakeholders.
People really didn't
like to be in meetings
with him, because
that's what he led with,
is him knowing the answer.
What led him to then decide that
he wanted to reframe it or look
at it differently is
when he recognized
that his job was no longer to
just be a subject-matter expert.
His job was to lead
in that organization.
ALISON BEARD: And
that's something
that so many people
struggle with as they
rise through the ranks.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
And so leading was not just
about feeding the answers
to folks.
That leading was also
about building the capacity
so that they could come
up with the answers.
That's part of leading is
you're building systems.
You're building people.
And oh, by the way,
to do it in a way
where you're not alienating
everyone else that you need
to be able to do the
work, but you're actually
getting them aligned.
And so when he
redefined what success
was, what the outcome
was that he wanted,
then we could work
backwards and say, OK, so
what is the belief
that you would
need to be able to reach
that type of success,
rather than just
getting to the answer.
And his reframe was,
I need to guide people
to the right answer, rather
than I have the right answer.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah,
that's just slow though.
And so a lot of people
struggle with that.
If I do, certainly,
if I'm editing a piece
and I know how the
sentence should read,
I don't make a comment
in the margins, hi,
could you emphasize
this instead of this?
I just redo it.
MURIEL WILKINS: And
it depends, again,
on what your outcomes are.
And so if your desired
outcome, you're
the result you want is, I'm just
trying to get this out the door
as quickly as possible,
then that works for you.
But if the desired
outcome is, I also
want to build talent
in this person,
and I want them to be
able to figure this
out on their own the
next time around,
then there has to be
a different approach,
because feeding them the
answer is not going to do that.
What you're creating there
is learned helplessness.
ALISON BEARD:
Right Oh, goodness.
OK, I might need some coaching
sessions after this, Muriel.
I thought there were
different blockers,
but maybe that's my one.
So if people can struggle with
several blockers at one time,
what's your advice for
how to tackle them?
Is it one by one?
Can you do multiple at once?
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, my advice is,
pick one, which
is really grounded
in any way you can or
should ever do change
is pick one thing at a time.
And so I would say
pick one, pick the one
that you're either most
motivated to work on or the one,
potentially, that's having the
most just-in-time consequences
for you and is really creating
a cost, and work on that one.
And I even try to hesitate
using the word work,
but rather, practice it.
Because this is a practice.
It never ends.
I mean, you just asked me, are
there any that I struggle with?
And I don't really even
think about them as struggle.
Every time they pop up,
I'm now able to recognize
them a lot faster.
And when they pop up, I'm
like, there you are again.
We know what to do.
And that's where
we want to get to.
It's making yourself
more nimble to deal
with any situation
in front of you
so that you can coach
yourself in the moment.
And the more you practice
it, the less time it takes.
And what you're measuring is
that your course correction is
a lot faster than
it was in the past,
and that you are able to enter
those situations with a lot more
ease than you previously have.
ALISON BEARD: So
the practice is,
the belief pops into your head
and you reframe it right away.
MURIEL WILKINS: The practice is,
the belief pops in your head.
You notice that it pops up.
You might not even
name it just yet.
You notice there's a dissonance.
Something feels off.
What's the belief
that's driving the off.
What am I doing?
What's driving it?
If I want something
differently, let
me reframe the
belief that's going
to increase the
probability that I will
get to what I actually want.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And can people do
this themselves?
We don't want to make this
an advertisement for Muriel
coaching.
But do people need a coach?
Do they need therapist?
Do they need a mentor?
MURIEL WILKINS: I'm trying
to work myself out of a job.
When I work with folks one on
one as their executive coach,
I measure the success that
by the time we're done,
they're able to do this
work on themselves.
And I know that they
can, because they'll
ask me something.
And before I can even open
my mouth, they'll say,
I already know what
I need to ask myself.
So the key here is
in the questions
that you're asking yourself,
because the answer is already
there.
And so yes, I absolutely
believe that folks
can do this for themselves.
They can learn to coach
themselves in most situations.
Maybe not.
We all need sometimes
a little extra support.
But if leaders can learn
to coach themselves,
it increases their
ability to coach others,
and it then increases
their ability
to face situations with more
ease, which, my goodness, would
certainly make things easier
for everyone else as well.
ALISON BEARD: Are
there any applications
to beliefs that people have
not just about themselves,
but about their organization or
their industry or their teams?
MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
The issue with those
is that, oftentimes,
the things on the outside of us,
their teams, their organization,
et cetera, are not things
that are in your control.
And so while we
can sit and reframe
them, which could be
helpful in just making
you feel a little
calmer, you can't then
exact the action against it.
And so I always
say start with you.
Not to say you hold
full responsibility
for whatever is happening,
but you certainly
contribute some of it,
particularly as a leader.
And if anything, even if
you're not contributing to it
from an action
standpoint, sometimes it's
just a way that
you want to change
the way that you're experiencing
the challenges that you're
facing.
I mean, we talked
about the uncertainty
that's happening right
now on a macro level.
Well, there are different
ways of experiencing
that uncertainty.
And something that you
do have control over
is how you experience
any situation,
but it doesn't start from
what you do in that situation.
It starts with what
you think about what
you do in that situation.
ALISON BEARD: Where some
people see a million risks,
other people see a
million opportunities.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
ALISON BEARD: And if
you're a team leader,
can you do some work to help
people understand their blockers
without pointing out, I see that
you have this hidden blocker?
And you always you're right,
and you need to change.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Because I know I'm
right about your hidden blocker.
So Absolutely.
Again, I would say that you
ought to start with yourself.
And you can number
one, role model
what it looks like to
be able to do this work.
So what does that look like?
You're in a meeting
and before you
start talking about what
you want the team to do,
you make it very clear
what your assumptions are
and your beliefs are right.
Again, assumptions is a
different way of framing it.
That may feel more
comfortable for you.
But then if you're helping
others on your team
before, let's say you're
having a feedback session
or feedback conversation
with someone on your team,
instead of moving directly
to here's the feedback,
here's what you need to do,
you may want to ask them,
for example, what were you
thinking about that situation
before you approached
it in that way.
If you have somebody who
is hesitant to speak up
in meetings, for
example, can ask
them, what is it that
you're thinking when you're
in those meetings that's getting
in the way of you speaking up?
And that then helps
you drill down to,
what is the mindset that
they would need to have?
You can then shift
to, what would
you need to think, what
assumptions would you
need to make to enable you to
speak up in those meetings?
And that, again, allows them to
open up in terms of the choices
that they have for
different approaches
in that particular situation.
ALISON BEARD:
Let's say all of us
start to do this, in our
team, in our organization.
What do you see as the
overarching positive benefit?
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, look,
I think there's so much talk
about organizational culture.
And when you think about
an organizational culture,
all it is is a collective
set of beliefs.
And so I think at
a collective level,
if everyone started to
check what are the beliefs
that we're bringing in,
what are the beliefs
that we need in order to
have the type of place
that we want to have,
that is what would then
propel a real culture change in
organizations and quite frankly,
propels change at all,
beyond organizations.
ALISON BEARD: So
it's basically, all
of the people who have learned
how to do this reframing,
getting together
and talking about,
OK, what are the beliefs
that are holding us back
collectively.
MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.
ALISON BEARD: And how
do we collectively
change how the
organization is going
to think about what it does?
MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.
I mean, you can do this at a
number of different levels,
whether it's for yourself,
you can do it at a team level.
Most of the frustration
I see on teams
is they can't get past
that storming stage
because there are
misaligned expectations.
Well, what are expectations?
Expectations are what we
believe needs to happen.
And so you need to level
set and check those beliefs,
check those expectations
and those assumptions
before you move
forward and decide
what they need to
be in order for us
to be able to move forward.
And you can certainly do
it at a collective level,
at an organizational level.
ALISON BEARD: Well, as you say,
I need to start with myself.
So I'm going to call you next
week, and we're going to start--
MURIEL WILKINS: Anytime.
ALISON BEARD: --uncovering
my biggest blockers.
Well, Muriel, thank you so much.
I've learned a lot
from this conversation.
And I'm going to develop
a more positive mindset
about my ability to
change and the fact
that I can reframe some of
the beliefs that are limiting.
MURIEL WILKINS: Terrific.
ALISON BEARD: Thank you so much.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you.
It was delightful.
