why was Russia so robust against not initially but eventually so robust against pushing back against the Germans despite losing tens of millions of soldiers the government doesn't collapse like the Zars did in World War I and not only that but a communist country is able to produce these really Advanced tanks in large and reliable numbers there's so many Mysteries are like why central planning worked why the government didn't collapse despite the fact that Stalin you know killed all so many people he would have been hated right so ah but Hitler killed more and was more hated uh what you're thinking about is what did the Russians do I'm going to flip it what do the Germans do a useful concept comes from the Samuel Griffith translation of sunzo which talks about death ground what's death ground it's when your enemy puts you on death ground which means they're going to kill you and therefore you have no choice but to fight because if you don't fight you're dead and even if you fight your odds are poor but at least that's the only way you're going to get out the ukrainians initially welcomed the Germans why because Stalin and friends had imposed the uh terrible Famine of the early 1930s on them and they couldn't imagine that anything would be worse than that until they met Nazis who then had them dig their own Mass Graves the ukrainians rethought that whole thing and if you do this to people you will conjure a formidable enemy so that's what happened to Russia you can see it happening to Ukraine now before your eyes go back uh before the invasion of Crimea in 2014 you got Ukraine which has very corrupt government and people were sixes and sevens about whether they want to do Ukrainian things or Russian things okay fast forward to now where you have Russians blowing away the people who were most loyal to them in the eastern part of the country who didn't leave their apartment buildings are being leveled by Russians ukrainians think aha you know this idea that we can coexist with these people is over and and our irony is Putin's forging Ukrainian national identity and Wars often do this in the United States uh we start out with our 13 colonies and they're all very different after the Revolutionary War that starts forging a national identity and by the time you get to the end of the Civil War where you have northern armies at least those people have been all over the country they have a real sense of nature by the end of that one it's interesting because the strategy we pursued with Germany and Japan was unconditional surrender now do you think of that is different than obviously we didn't commit genocide or anything but you think that is different than the sort of um total unlimited policy objectives that for example Germany had in Ukraine or Japan had in China or we also pursued unconditional surrender against the south in the Civil War right so how do you think about because that's also something where your back is up against the wall why did that not result in the same kind of morale because because the United States did not put the people of these countries on death ground the leadership had self- put themselves on death ground by where the basically the problem for Tojo hiedi is if he backs down on anything he's out of office and then he doesn't know what happens after that so he personally is on Career death ground and possibly he thinks uh well we would we we were planning to that he would get executed at the end of the war but the Japanese people eventually figured out that they weren't on J death ground and in fact the Japanese people were so exhausted by the whole thing that they the society shattered um but the United States was never uh going to put the German people start massacring them in the way that the Russians massacred the poles when they moved in the Germans massacred the poles how do you wind up with eight or nine million polish deaths in World War II think about that's a large number it's because they're massing they're being massed but there was a fire bombing you know Tokyo and Dron and Berlin I think it was in your book that 84,000 people died in that one night fire bombing in Tokyo it's terrible why did that not make them put them in the mind frame of a sort of total uh death ground well a I don't know but B Japan had been at War since 1931 in China uh they had been sending large armies this isn't like recent us Wars the counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan this is their sending hundreds of of thousands of troops to occupy Manchuria the Chinese don't give up it goes on and on and on so by the time you're getting to 1945 it's a long time also they had committed atrocities in China and they knew all about it and the atrocities got even better when there were wounded Japanese soldiers their commanders ordered their fellow soldiers to execute them because they didn't want cripples going home they couldn't deal with them there and so rather than have the pick them up they executed them in place you can you imagine how Japanese soldiers felt about this how do we explain the high morale the famously High morale of the Japanese military where they would refuse to surrender even after given orders by their superiors despite knowing about um these things that you were talking about uh it's true um it's because it's a different culture so in Japanese culture you belong to ingroups or out groups so the biggest ingroup the Japanese belong to was Japanese people and everybody else but within Japan you come from a province a locality Etc you go school education various places you belong to a job wherever you have and there are various units within your job and you owe loyalty it's obligations in the west it's all about Liberties and my rights in the East it's about obligations to other people and so you owe obligations to all of these uh organizations and when they soldiers are thinking about war they're not thinking about Grant strategy they're thinking about operational success so the moment you as a soldier start losing a battle instead of in the west where you can Retreat you can surrender and it's not dishonorable because you're going to live to fight another day in Japan you're a failure and therefore if you go come home back as a failed Soldier you bring dishonor to yourself your family uh your locality anyone you are associated with so that's why it is so difficult to for them to surrender however by the time you get to the end of the war they are so exhausted think about it their economy is I don't know I can't remember the statistics exactly something like a tenth of our economy they have something like a 13th of our I can't remember was coal or steel production and they don't have any um local oil production uh they're importers of food and they're not getting that food so by the time you get to 45 they're exhausted and it's um it's a shattering that occurs and um finally at the very end you have emperor hero who knew full well earlier if he disagreed and he didn't disagree for a long time that he would be assassinated or be proclaimed deranged and he had a perfectly good underage son to be used as a figure head he knew that he couldn't do much about it uh at the very end when he decided he was about to get nuked that's when he intervenes to break the deadlock and at the cabinet meetings and there are a variety of people at the very top who realizes it's over could heroo have intervened earlier I doubt it let's go back more than five years if he intervenes um when Japan is overextending in China is there any chance that he could have succeeded I doubt he uh thought of Japan overextending in China what expertise does he have he liked Guppies he likes studying fish in his backyard he has no expertise and then of course there's the Hubers of it all that we're going to dominate this place and they look at the Chinese as an absolutely feckless backward place that's had all these warlord things going on and it doesn't Dawn on them that by their extreme brutality in China the Chinese finally get it going uh we're not the problem the Japanese are the problem and it is uh what the Japanese do that superlu China and is the great impetus to n nation building you can see parallels with Hitler doing the same thing in Russia and and also right now um uh Putin's busy canonizing uh zalinski and uh creating a real Nation out of Ukraine that's never going to forget these ongoing events yeah well what I learned from your book that I thought was really interesting and also tragic because of the counterfactual was one of the strategies you suggested what could have been that Japan could have if it thought like a continental power it could have allied with the Nationalist to beat the Communist in Russia maybe waged almost a three- front war with Germany the Nationalist and Japan beat the Communist and prevented the Communists from taking hold in China and given the consequences of Communism in Russia and China and how many lives could have been saved if you know I guess Hitler was beaten and the Communists are beaten that Japanese choice just seems so tragic let's say they do it uh that means Hitler forever and that means if you're anything but a nice Aran uh your days are numbered certainly it would be the have been the most massive ethnic cleanse ever in Europe
