For markets to be efficient in any degree,
not even perfectly efficient.
This famous idea of the wisdom of crowds
has to be helping us a lot.
The hypothesis that we're all geniuses
is never going to fly, right?
So the wisdom of crowds and, you know.
Well, says, even if on average,
most people don't know the answer,
the stupid answers cancel.
And the right answers don't,
because they're the same.
My favorite example of that,
and this might be dating myself, is
is, Regis Philbin
and Who Wants to Be a millionaire?
Right.
Remember the show? Multiple choice show.
It's frightening that you're
describing that as old, but I guess it is.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's been off the air.
Sadly, Regis has passed away. It's old.
Sorry. Sorry.
But you had multiple cheats.
Like three cheats.
One was a friend,
and a friend was almost useless.
You people a your friend
usually wasn't much smarter than you.
And b people. At least to me.
I didn't watch every episode, but seemed
to choose friends who knew the same stuff.
They knew.
Right.
You really want to choose a friend who is
in, like, a totally different field?
I think in some countries,
the friends also had a tendency
to deliberately give the wrong answer
because they just
didn't want to see their friend actually
win money.
The most cynical phrase ever is nothing
succeeds like a friend's failure.
There we go.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway
and I'm Joe Weisenthal 
Joe It's a big month for us.
It's a big month for us.
We've been doing this for ten years.
I know, I can't believe it.
Do you remember the first episode?
Yeah. Of course, with, Tom Keene. Yeah.
And then our second episode,
I think, was about bananas.
For some reason, it was. You're right.
It took us a long time,
to figure out what we were doing.
It took us a long time
to figure out what we were doing,
and I don't think I would have that point.
I would have expected
that we'd be doing it ten years.
I don't know.
I was expecting,
I think, turning on a microphone
in a radio studio and talking for a while.
Oh, we started doing it
because we wanted to have a podcast
and talk to interesting people.
I think we were hashtag blessed
that no one was listening for a very,
very long time, which gave us a long
runway to figure things out.
So we got lucky.
That said, you know, ten years.
It is, in fact,
a long time to be doing this.
And a lot has changed in that period.
A lot has changed in that period.
Sometimes mind blowing.
And it really, you know, I feel like and
we've talked about this before for sure,
but the thing that we were covering
is capital
and news at the time are now capital
H history.
And it's like these things
that are we sort of take for granted.
Everyone was there was like no children.
Let us tell you
what it was like in the old days
when, you know, people were worried
the world was going to come to an end
because, you
know, Greece is sovereign debt
and all this stuff that we just
sort of part of the landscape,
but people don't remember it.
No, one of those things has to be
the idea of value or fundamental
investing, right?
Like, let us tell you about the days
when price actually mattered.
Letters had a limit
to what investors would pile into.
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Let us talk about the days
when people used to talk about PE ratios.
This stock oh it's at a 20 5BE.
We better sell it and buy the stock
at two £0.15 or whatever.
Yes, that feels quaint.
Maybe it'll be back there one day.
But for now, given
how many things in the market seem to be,
some of these, the Grandma and Dodd
kind of stuff, it feels a little old.
A little old fashioned.
Little old fashioned.
Yeah. Okay.
So one of the big themes that has emerged
in the ten years
that we've been doing this podcast is,
everyone seems to have grown more stupid.
I would say, hopefully that's not related.
It's not like a correlation thing.
It, it could be all right.
But, you know, we have all this
gamification of investing,
people betting on lines going up.
Yeah.
Or down, people betting on random meme
coins, things like that.
And I think, you know,
we talk about it a lot on the podcast,
but this is actually
a fundamental shift in the market.
If you think about the market as something
that's supposed to be about capital
allocation.
Yeah, alignment of incentives.
People are investing in something
because they think it's
going to be profitable in the future
at the right price.
And now people
are just sort of piling into stuff
because other people are doing it.
And again, line go up deep down,
I still believe that the value of a stock
should reflect the net present value.
I know you're an MH guy, but I've, it's
been a little bit hard with,
some of these things and,
you know, the other thing too,
that is sort of change
is that like half of our episodes
these days are kind of
AI related in some way.
And so I think there's
a lot of interesting stuff
going on, particularly
at the intersection of tech and applying
tech to both investing in tech,
but then the application of tech
to investing and so forth.
So, yes, much has changed,
a lot has changed.
And we have the perfect guest
to talk about how everyone has grown
more stupid over time.
We're going to be speaking with someone
we've wanted on the show for a really,
really long time.
I'm very excited about this.
It's Cliff Asness
the co-founder and CIO of AQR.
Thank you so much for coming
on. All thoughts.
Thank you for having me.
What's it like to be a rational person
living in an irrational world class?
Yeah,
you've been doing it for a long time.
Well, a rational person is not always
how I'm described,
but there's rational investing,
and then there's rational conduct
in your personal life.
So let's just distinguish those,
you guys in your intro
said like,
it's a little it's
a little scary for the next hour
because you said
like a third of the things I want to say.
Oh, shoot. Okay.
I wrote a rather, you know, gigantic piece
in the Journal of Portfolio Management.
They were having a 50th anniversary.
None of us were quite old enough
to have been there in the first issue,
but they were looking for the old guys
to write kind of retrospectives.
And the piece I wrote was called
The Less Efficient Market Hypothesis.
And now I think you guys
probably know this, but my dissertation
advisor was, a little known guy
named Eugene Fama we've heard of,
I was his Ta for two years.
I grew up in MH.
I love that you guys should say MH
and your audience knows.
Yeah, what you're talking about.
That is not the norm for me.
When I, when I,
when I talk about these things,
I was
not a perfect, efficient marketer
even back then.
Neither is Gene, by the way.
Gene, Gene's not a zealot.
Yeah, well, he about third week of class.
I know that's because I took the class
three times I didn't fail,
but as the ta, I sat through it,
three full years.
And like, the third week, he always tells
the class markets are almost
certainly not perfectly efficient
because genes are brilliant guy
and recognizes
that perfection is a really stupid idea.
He's been on the show, by the way.
Oh, I didn't okay. Yeah, yeah.
And I don't know if that came up,
but he's always very honest about that.
He probably thinks they're considerably
more efficient than I do these days.
And I think I probably think it's
they're more efficient than then
maybe the active average retail trader.
But I wrote a dissertation for him
on the success of price momentum.
That is not a very gene Fama dissertation.
A gene Fama dissertation is I've studied
price momentum and it loses gobs of money.
And these idiots on Wall Street do it
anyway.
That's kind of a fishing market.
Look how silly they are.
And he was great about it.
I remember I kind of mumbled, I'm like,
I want to write a dissertation
on price momentum. And by the way, I.
I find it works very well.
What was that? Cliff? It works very well.
What was that? Cliff? It works very well.
And he said, if it's in the data,
write the paper.
So, I've drifted at least a little bit
further from efficient markets,
even way back then, now price momentum.
I'll do a lot of Segways. You're
going to have to stop. No, that's great.
That's fine.
I do parenthetical
within parenthetical price.
Momentum is often
thought of as this index of irrationality.
It can work for two different reasons.
It can work because of yes, feedback
loops.
Chasing line goes up, just like you said
before, and people pour in,
which isn't very connected to reality.
It's just chasing returns.
But it can also work, because of what
the behavioral
finance people would call under reaction.
News comes out
that should move the price by so and so.
On average, we have found
they say we it's the royal we of academia
and private researchers
that the price moves in the right
direction but doesn't move all the way.
So if you trade on that,
there's still a little bit to go.
That's a quant thing.
You wouldn't want to bet on one
stock that way.
But if on average that happens
and you could do that through
observing the price or the fundamentals,
there's usually a little bit more to go.
So it's not always irrational. Momentum.
But here's
here's what I observed
in the very beginning of acre AQR
launched in 1998 after
we had a fabulous run at Goldman Sachs.
Is this survivorship bias?
And this you don't get to start your own
billion dollar hedge fund
unless you have a fabulous run
at Goldman Sachs or something.
Equivalent.
We had a good first month.
You know, the story is going to go and
you say you had a good first month, right?
And then that first month, by the way,
was August of of 1998,
when the S&P was down
20% on the Russian debt crisis.
And we're doing high fives,
like we say, we're market neutral
and we're up a little bit in a crash.
And it was my first
of many lessons,
never too high, five in this business,
when you fully retire and divest,
you get one high five now.
But that's the.
Well, no, it's the end.
When you do the high fives.
I'm a I'm I'm a queen too.
Is is also superstitious.
Which if that's a contradiction
what the heck.
But the next 18 months was the crescendo
of the famous dot.com or tech bubble.
And that was not kind to us.
It was particularly
not kind because we decided to start
with a extremely aggressive, market
neutral fund.
So momentum
helped, as you can imagine, in a bubble.
But value was just destroyed
and that was most of the model back then.
Things have really broadened,
broadened out.
We hit spreads
between cheap and expensive.
This is something we invented at the time,
and now a lot of people do.
No one had
people said short stocks on valuations
go long, the cheap, short the expensive.
But the very obvious question of how cheap
and how expensive are they?
Sometimes pretty tightly clustered,
sometimes wider.
Does that mean they're better or worse
going forward?
Was not asked before.
So we invented this measure,
and the spread between cheap and expensive
for 50 years had looked like a
well behaved series.
It moved around a fair amount, but.
And then I'm drawing on my hand
if you see the video.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. We should mention
this is an audio medium.
So and then in late 99, 2000
and went to just way
wider than anything ever seen for 50
plus years.
We also showed that
historically those were better times.
You never saw that before, but when it was
wider were better times for value.
We stuck with it.
We made money. Round trip. Life was good
if you would ask me after the round trip,
which was harrowing.
You know, even if we love our process,
you never want to start a business
with poor returns,
if you ask me.
At the end of that, which was probably
a couple years later, 2003,
do you think you're ever going
to see that in your career again?
I think I would,
I think don't want to ask, thank God,
because I think
I would have gotten it wrong,
but but I think I would have said, oh,
probably not.
Hopefully.
I wouldn't say definitely no one who does
what any of us do for a living,
I should say definitely.
That's a bad word.
In markets, 40% is the favored
term, right?
There's always a 40% chance there's all,
but hey,
it was the craziest thing
numerically in 50 plus years.
Be the question presupposes it's built in
that I and people of my cohort
will still be around.
Yeah, right.
And we'll probably be closer to in charge.
So how's it going to happen again?
And then it happened again.
Even before Covid, by late 2019,
that spread between cheap and expensive
was approaching income extremes.
And then it blew past it in, in in Covid,
it went to what I in a geeky math
joke that no one ever gets called
125th percentile.
There is a 125th percentile.
Okay, it's the new 100th percentile.
I'm trying to convey that it went further
and we survived that one too.
We suffered somewhat
and then we made more than all of it.
Back round trip. Good.
Most of the time we really don't look like
value investors, by the way,
only in extreme bubbles
do we seem to have that property.
And I think it's smaller
now than it used to be.
The last five years
have been quite strong for us,
and it's not been a very good value
market.
Yeah.
There's so many questions that I have
that I want to ask that,
are sort of embedded
or related to your answer.
I'm gonna just ask
you just like a very narrow question,
sort of skip ahead in something dumb.
You should make it
the spread between the most expensive
and the cheapest stocks. Yes.
How much easier it is to simply compile
that spread.
Is it today
versus the technology that you're working
with when you're starting your career?
For that, I got to disappoint in saying
not that much.
Okay.
We had the databases. Okay.
A lot of technological advancement
is about speed.
Okay.
And new data sets
with what quants will call alternative
data is something we're very into.
But the classic data, if you're looking
for price to sales ratios.
I'm old, but we had tested out that old.
We had telephones in Bloomberg's,
but that does bring us to me
observing these two episodes.
And I step back and I asked a question,
what the hell happened?
Why did we see something
crazier than 50 years?
And then why did it happen again?
And that led to this paper,
the Less Efficient Market Hypothesis.
I do believe that markets have shown,
and I think I have some good guesses
as to why, that they are more susceptible
to bouts of crazy, than they used to be.
Just before going further,
one quick definitional question.
Efficient markets.
Because one way you could define
whether or not market is efficient is
are these securities disconnected
from what
you would say, the net present value
of all future free cash flows?
Another way that I often think about it,
but I'm no quant, is are there obvious
opportunities for the active manager
to make money just for our purposes here?
How do you define market efficiency?
Much closer to the first one. Okay.
The practical question of
can you make money?
From these is if they're a big deviations
from fair value.
And this relates to some stuff I did
in a less efficient market hypothesis,
if there are big deviations, the classic
and you'll notice
a giant caveat
if you can stick with your position.
Not a small thing.
You will make money.
There are opportunities.
And in fact,
I think a less efficient market.
In that sense,
in your present value sense,
almost has to deliver bigger opportunities
for people who can stick with it.
It also makes it considerably harder
to stick with.
Yeah, because the extremes
you have to live through
and the length of time
those extremes can go on.
For one thing, that I'm dying
for an academic to take me up on this.
I'm too old to do the math on this.
But most I've never seen a model
that looks at pain.
You just utility the negative
of losing money in terms
of how long you've lost money for,
not just magnitude.
Right.
And in real life I can tell you a drawdown
that is one and a half times bigger,
but with six months instead of three years
is ridiculously easier to,
to live through.
So the, the bigger disconnect
from reality again,
I haven't even told you why
I think it's going on,
but if I'm right that we have
these bouts of it, it's not necessarily
every day things are crazy, but
these bouts of it is is a two edged sword.
It's a bigger opportunity for people who
can stick with it, and it's harder to do.
And I find that not that what I think is
fair is particularly relevant,
but I find that that really fair, harder
to do but more lucrative if you can do it.
I don't think the efficient
market idea of buying
what is fundamentally mismatched against
its future cash flows, adjusted for risk
forecasting, those cash flows,
what risk really means
we still have some open issues there.
Yeah,
but I don't think that will ever go away
unless markets are perfectly efficient.
But how easy it is to identify
and how easy it is to stick with,
I think crazy markets,
make it easier to identify
what to do and harder to do like that.
I do want to ask you
why you think this is happening.
But before we do,
this is a very basic question,
but sometimes the basic questions
are the most interesting.
But when you say it's painful
to try to stay rational
during these bouts of irrationality,
why is that exactly?
Because I get that
there are funding costs,
I get that there are carrying costs.
But on the other hand,
you're a big hedge fund with deep pockets.
This is presumably
what investors are paying you to do.
Is it just the emotional trauma
or stress of having to explain to everyone
why you're taking the position that
you have when it's not paying off yet?
That is a big part of it.
I have a running fight with one of
my co-founders who never gets upset.
I'm always upset, but I'm more upset
when we're losing money.
This is sort of our dynamic.
I have to say, I get more upset than Joe
where he'll come in
my office during a bad period,
and I'll be upset.
It'll be a bad day in a bad period.
He's like, why are you upset?
And I'm like, well,
because people are yelling at us and I,
we're losing money.
And he's like, but you're pretty sure
we're going to win, right?
I'm like, yeah.
He's like, and you have all your own money
and your kid's money in this, right?
So you're not doing anything different.
You wouldn't do that
if you weren't. I'm like, yeah.
He's like, so we're going to win.
It's just a question of when,
why do you care?
And I look at him like he's from Mars
and go, why do you not care?
And we finally figured out, is it
kind of obvious that I talk to clients
a lot more than he does?
It's a lot easier to have that attitude
when you're just sitting in your office.
Also, we are not immune from this.
You get even if people love you
and think you've done
well for 25 years, you have a bad
two years, you get redemptions
and some of those are of serious size.
We fell
by like half over about three years.
And that's not fun.
You have to shrink your firm.
You have to let some people you love go.
So there is some real pain
that goes with that.
It does not.
That period did not shake my confidence
in the actual investment process.
I feel bad.
I think I did better than our investors
because I kept adding and saying,
take the ball up on what I do.
Not everyone can do that,
and I know more than they know.
Not in a weird insider sense.
And just, I should be more confident
in my own process than anyone else's.
But it was.
It is excruciating. The amount I remember,
someone I admire tremendously
when Stan Druckenmiller,
retired, to run his own money.
He's still very active in markets.
I think he wrote a note
that resonated with me.
Because I forget the exact details,
but the essence was
it's too painful
into upsetting to run client money.
The man never had a down year.
And I'm
like, if Stan can take it, those of us.
And we've had a lot more up years
than down years
and life's been good
or I won't be sitting here,
but we've had never three,
but two plus years of of pain.
And I'm like, if Stan can't take it, man,
this is harder to do than it looks like
the whole world thinks you're stupid
when you're losing money.
No matter what you can point to,
no matter what evidence you can point to,
I should say the whole world,
your mom still likes you.
But, a lot of your world.
And know a lot of investors stuck with us,
and I love them for it.
But you do lose a lot of people,
so it's not fun for a business
to go through that intuitively,
though, is to your point, measuring
the utility of long drought drawdowns
versus deep, drawdowns.
This must be a very acute thing for anyone
who's not just managing
their own personal portfolio
for the reason that you've just described.
Yeah, I, I've,
I've talked about this with other money
managers, this idea of length versus
versus severity. Yeah.
And I've never had one who's not like
yeah, length is is much worse.
Well, one of the things is
when something goes on,
it's often a similar story
for two and a quarter years.
Yeah.
Right.
So you go back after six months
where rationality
is getting absolutely punished.
You get a lot of sympathy from people.
You show them, look,
the bigger bargains, we're right.
We're going to be right.
You go back six months later, like, okay,
you go back
six months and six months later.
They're like,
you're just saying the same for year.
And eventually they just think
maybe you're a dinosaur.
Or like, maybe you just don't get
this new wave that's going.
Is it possible that we've really had
a again, it's not everyone.
We have a tremendous amount of investors
stick with us
and we have ones who double up who get it,
that those are often opportunities.
But but you shrink
when you lose money for a while
and you grow
when you make money for a while.
It's the ironclad rule of this business.
And and sometimes it's just backwards.
So one of the things
that has been happening recently,
that has changed from 2015
when we started doing this, is retail
participation in the market, and it just
feels like it is such a big thing
for retail investors now to use things
like options, even, you know, 1 or 0 day
options, the kind of stuff that you might
more traditionally associate
with someone running a hedge fund.
Now they're trading.
Oh, we're not stupid enough.
Okay, well, there we go. Options.
All right.
Some hedge funds, then.
Does the increased presence
of retail in the market
change
the way that you do business at all?
I think it contributes
to what we're talking about
of this dislocation.
I hate this because I sound very elitist
when I this on, on retail,
but there's a lot of academic work
that shows retail on net losers.
They don't net is important.
They go through periods where they win.
They go through periods
where they win a lot.
You know, if you buy a meme stock going to
triples tomorrow, you don't always lose.
But on average retail transfers, money
to Wall Street and to institutions.
So if they're a bigger force in markets,
you're going to have more of that
going on.
And it jives perfectly
because that would raise the opportunity
if they're generally
on the wrong side of things.
But there are more of them,
many more of them than they used to be.
They can be right.
Even if they're wrong on the facts.
They can be right on the numbers
for longer than they used to be.
So I do think this is part of it.
And I apologize
to all the really smart retail investors.
Anytime you talk about averages,
you're dissing a whole lot of people
that don't deserve to be.
But on average, retail loses
zero day options.
Oh my God, they're making exactly
the people
they claim to despise on Wall Street.
Very rich. By trading these things.
And it's it's just vandals.
I love that.
Well, all right,
we got to get to the question of why.
Right. But one last question.
Sort of leading up to it.
How do you establish that?
What do you look at in the market that
right now you say
this is a less efficient market than once?
It was.
What are these number.
What is the measure or is it just feel
or you just feel sort of crazy
like as observed,
most of it is quantitative.
Okay. I do start with this thing
I've talked about already.
This spreads between cheap and expensive.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't just look at spreads.
I wrote a piece back in 2000
during the tech bubble.
It's called bubble logic.
Never got published
because I tried to make a book out of it.
And the bubble came down too fast for me.
It that was good for my business,
but bad for my my my author,
career.
Where I didn't just look at price
multiples.
I looked at it in a more holistic sense.
What growth do we need to justify
these multiples trying to come up?
The only time I will use the word
bubble is when I've tried very hard,
and it doesn't
mean we'll come up with the same answer,
but this is the framework I use.
I've tried
very hard to come up with assumptions,
even if I don't like them and think
they're at the outer edge of possible.
That could justify these prices.
Yeah, and if they don't come close twice
in my career I've been willing to go,
no, this this I'm willing
needs to be word.
I should tell you right now,
when it comes to within stocks,
the whole market is a different issue.
The market is quite expensive,
right? Yeah.
But when it comes to the spread
between cheap and expensive,
I'm not using the bubble word, okay?
We're that same measure.
It's not the 125th percentile anymore.
It's the,
I haven't called the 77th percentile.
It's wider than on average,
maybe making it a little more attractive
if you can stick with it. That big if,
But I
don't use the word bubble
for 77th percentile.
I use it for blowing through.
So five years ago,
I was saying it's a bubble.
Now I'm just saying
this is a little bit of an odd market.
So I want to ask
you more about the bubble.
But we keep, we keep touting that.
We're going to ask you the question.
So let's ask the why question, okay.
Why are markets becoming less efficient?
Okay.
Well, first of all,
I and I say this in the piece,
a lot of conjecture going on.
This is an op ed.
As statisticians I think a 50 page.
Yeah, a 50 page page.
I think academic op ed.
Look, this is our first time doing this.
You will be convinced I could do a 50
page, single spaced op ed, I believe you.
I know you can't, it's just as a quant,
as a statistician,
you'd like to see 100 bubbles.
Have stats on each one.
This way they're all they'd rhyme,
but they wouldn't be exactly the same.
You tease out what's going on.
If you see two in a 35 year career,
you're not going to be able
to prove this statistically.
But I believe in my conjectures.
I'm not soft soaping.
I'm. I'm, I'm or soft selling.
I'm I'm. Yeah.
I just wanted clear that
that that nobody is going to walk away
saying he proved it.
I list a few reasons in the piece why
markets might be prone to bouts of bigger
disconnects from reality.
My second favorite,
is one I'm sure you've talked about.
I know I've listened to
you guys talk about it.
The rise of Passive Investing.
I am not a passive hater.
They're really smart people.
Mike Green's out there.
The amount that guy hates passive.
I don't know.
The Middle East has never seen hate. Like.
Like the amount my green hates passive.
But but again, he's a smart.
He's a smart guy. He makes interesting
arguments. I'm not that guy.
I think passive has been a huge positive
for an investor.
Welfare.
I actually was lucky enough
to be fairly good friends with Jack Bogle,
and he was a hero of mine.
We had a podcast briefly, and he did
two really, and he came on it finally.
I in fact, I'll tell you
part of that story in a second.
So the
rise of I'm not a passive hater,
but here's what we know.
We know the whole world cannot be passive.
And when I say passive, I mean in the Jack
Bogle market cap weighted sense,
sometimes people use passive
for people like us,
and they really mean rules based,
like you're not.
And that's not how I use the word passive.
I mean, someone who owns the entire
market.
Yeah, we're long short and leverage.
How do you get to passive on that?
I don't know, but some people do.
I own the entire market.
We had Jack on the podcast
and he absolutely agreed.
You can't.
Everyone can't be passive.
Now, of course, being Jack Bogle,
he thinks at that point
the marginal investor
should still move to passive, but
he recognizes the obvious fact
that if 100% of the people
are not looking at prices,
nobody's looking at prices.
Who's figuring out if Nvidia is worth more
or less than the corner drugstore?
Right.
So the market gets very weird there.
We don't even understand what happens
there. It's a singularity.
I use a physics analogy.
We don't know what happens.
There are PhD students in finance,
and I used to be
one of these will stay up late
at night in their cups talking about
what happens if everyone was passive,
what would it even look like?
We know it's very weird,
and I doubt all the weirdness happens
between 99.999% passive and 100.
So we're on a curve.
We're a lot more passive
than we used to be.
Even that you're probably aware it's
hard to measure exactly how how much
is passive direct passive true market cap.
Wait, you can measure.
But what about people who take, you know,
80 basis points of tracking error?
They're kind of mostly passive.
Are people pegged to like custom indices?
Now it's kind of funny.
You guys remember The Princess Bride?
Yeah, yeah.
Remember mostly dead.
That's
probably dead. You're mostly passive.
So I think
fewer people thinking about prices, fewer
people willing to take the other side
when things get a little crazy.
If one if one side
really starts to get crazy,
there are fewer people out there
that has to exacerbate these swings.
My actual number one reason,
though, you talked about the gamification.
For me, it's the overall,
I'm going to sound like a very old man
yelling
at the sky on my lawn right now, you know,
get off my lawn or yelling at the sky.
Some Simpsons thing.
Yeah.
I'm Abe in this case,
but someone yells at cloud.
Yeah, exactly.
Thank you. Social media
and the broader environment.
I don't want to do politics except to say
I don't think you find many people.
There'll be some.
But I don't think you find many people
who don't agree with the idea
that this environment has made
our politics worse and more dangerous.
We confirmation bias.
We we live in our own bubbles.
We have algorithms
that push us further and further towards.
You start out as, moderate belief,
but it keeps pushing you towards extremes.
And, and pretty soon
you're saying stupid things like,
hey, that Tucker Carlson, he's a good guy.
All right,
I might have revealed a little poll.
Yeah, you did a bit of politics there.
So all of that
adds up to making our politics worse,
more prone, in particular
to swings and extremes.
Markets are not arbitrage mechanisms
that sometimes misunderstood
their voting mechanisms.
The price is a weighted average vote
where the weight is by dollars.
I lucky enough to get more vote
than the average person in Warren Buffett,
gets a lot more votes than than I get.
If we all disagree on on on on opinions.
The reason is on an arbitrage mechanism.
And here I'll get a little geeky.
I imagine you're reasonably sure
this thing is mispriced
in that Gramm and Dodd sense,
and you think it's massively mispriced
trading enough to make it a third less
mispriced.
It's not very risky to you
because it's not that big a trade
and it's
very high expected return
because it's that mispriced.
Now you've moved it back to a third
or maybe half the next
part of the trade is much riskier to you
because you already have the trade on.
So you're just adding more.
Oh, I see it. Yeah.
And it has half the gain
because you've already closed it by half.
So arbitrage will not take the
if on net more people believe
something stupid stupid is going to win.
And we're going to be
at least somewhat off of real prices.
And I find it remarkably easy to believe
that this same environment
that makes our politics go a little crazy.
For markets to be efficient
in any degree,
not even perfectly efficient.
This famous idea of the wisdom of crowds
has to be helping us a lot.
The hypothesis that we're all geniuses
is never going to fly, right?
So the wisdom of crowds and,
you know, well, says, even if on average,
most people don't know the answer,
the stupid answers cancel.
And the right answers don't,
because they're the same.
My favorite example of that,
and this I might be dating myself
is, is, Regis Philbin.
And who wants to be a millionaire?
Right?
Remember the show multiple choice show?
It's frightening that you're
describing that as old, but I guess it is.
Yeah, yeah, it's been off the air.
Sadly, Regis has passed away. It's old.
Sorry, sorry.
But you had to answer
multiple choice questions,
and if you miss one, you're out.
They start off ridiculously easy,
and they get harder and harder.
You had multiple cheats.
Like three cheats.
One was a friend.
A friend was almost useless.
You people a your friend
usually wasn't much smarter than you.
And b people, at least to me.
I. I didn't watch every episode,
but seemed to choose friends
who knew the same stuff. They knew. Right?
You really want to choose a friend
who is in, like a totally different field?
I think in some countries,
the friends also had a tendency
to deliberately give the wrong answer
because they just
didn't want to see their friend actually
win money.
The most cynical phrase ever is nothing
succeeds like a friend's failure.
There we go.
I don't I'm not condoning that.
But it is out there.
The other one
was, eliminate two of the wrong answers.
That's great.
Yeah, obviously,
even if you have no idea,
you go from one out of 4 to 1 out of two.
The other one was poll the audience.
And at least to my non-exhaustive
examination, I didn't. I
it seemed to work pretty much every time,
even if the question was hard,
because I imagine you have
100 people in a room.
Ten of them know the answer.
The other ones are guessing the 90
distribute evenly over the the four.
Maybe not perfectly evenly.
It's, but roughly evenly.
The ten all end on B, so you pick
B because it's bigger work
pretty much every time.
There's a crucial assumption in that
the the audience has to be
relatively independent of each other.
And they did that.
They weren't talking.
It was silent voting.
If the audience all gets to talk,
maybe the ten convince the 90,
but maybe they don't.
Maybe a demagogue with a better, Twitter
feed convinces everyone, and if you ruin
the independence and I think
we ever come up with a better vehicle
for turning a wisdom of crowds into,
craziness of mobs, then social media,
I'd be hard pressed to to describe it.
I find this to be very compelling.
Jim sur wiki at the New York Times,
he came out with that
book, Wisdom of Crowds in 2005,
but that was right before social media
blew up.
And then, you know,
there's that famous book and, 1841
extraordinary popular delusion
and the Madness of crowds.
So we've always sort of understood
that crowds can be modes,
be both mad and wise.
And I find this very interesting,
the idea that perhaps the likeness of
the crowd is what sort of flips
it from wisdom to madness.
I think that's exactly right.
You maybe can come up
with counterexamples,
but I think most of the time,
if the crowd is making
independent decisions
and this can go for political voting
and go for markets,
you're going to get some degree of wisdom.
When the crowd is all making
a unified decision.
It can still work out,
but you are much more susceptible,
to, what the quants technical term is.
Cray cray.
I want
to pivot a little bit and talk about AI.
You've, written or you've talked recently.
I forget exactly the word that was used in
some of the headlines, succumbing
to the rendering or surrendering
to the machine, regrets and so forth.
What is it?
We talk, we try to talk a lot about?
I still don't know exactly what it means
in any context.
What does it mean to surrender
to the machines in the income?
Well, first, not
not every journalist has Bloomberg's
high standards.
But I am reasonably certain
I said partially
in that in the word partially got dropped.
Even skipping all the details. Yeah.
If you're going to use AI in your process
at all,
almost by definition,
you are going to lose a little intuition.
And the way I say that,
and it bothered me for a couple of years,
I think I slowed us down on AI by a year
or two just by saying,
you know, we've always prided ourselves on
the balance of we intuitively understand
why we think we this makes money
and the evidence that it makes money.
And when you go to AI,
you're normally giving up some.
Not all.
We actually do try very hard to figure out
why we think this works or doesn't work.
But if you weren't giving up
some intuition,
what the heck is the AI doing?
If it's simple and you could have just
seen it with the naked eye,
it's hard to imagine it's helping.
But let me give you a concrete example.
We like good momentum.
We like it in price.
We like it in fundamentals.
One way people, on the quant side,
have tried to measure this for years
is something like earnings calls,
trying to decide if earnings
calls are good news or bad news.
And if people under react to good news,
you want to buy when it's
when it's good news.
Is this
just like how many times people say
great quarter guys or are you looking at
something else? It's
going to sound about as silly as that.
Okay, you build up tables of words
and phrases with numerical values,
and then you say,
what's the numerical score of this?
And they can be much more subtle
than this.
I'm going to use a real simple example.
The word increasing plus one. Right.
And I'm sure you see the floor.
If the actual sentence was massive,
embezzlement is increasing.
You know our bet on that one.
The amount of fraud we're seeing in
our private credit deals is increasing.
Quant can survive looking stupid a lot,
if that's 47% of the time.
If 53% of the time it's
getting it right, fine.
And those things had some efficacy,
but they weren't great.
What we do today is we train
ML, it's called natural language
processing.
It's a subfield of out of ML
to analyze corporate statements.
But what it does, and this is going to be
the geekiest thing, I'll say.
It represents every corporate statement.
It looks across them
and represents them as a set of numbers,
what the geeks
will call a vector of numbers.
Then what we do is Paris to say,
all right, we have 50 years
of this across many firms.
We have different vectors of numbers
for every earnings call.
What combination go long
when the first number's
good, short when the second number is
is is high blah blah blah.
What best combination forecasts
that seems to be correlated
to what we were doing before these word
count things just considerably better.
It does a better job than word counts.
And that blank language is very nonlinear.
Whether something is good,
whether that word increasing is good,
AI is not perfect, but it's chance
of figuring out if if increasing was good
or bad, especially when it's trained on
tons of these things better than us.
Here's where you lose the intuition.
No, I skip the step.
I like to do that. That's fun. Sneaky.
If you ask myself,
or even some of the younger people
who are much more tooled up
on, on, on machine learning than I am
these days, what does that
vector of numbers actually mean?
You often get a,
we we really can't tell you that.
We can say it.
It's summing up in a mathematical sense,
the information content of that.
We still get intuition
because this indicator
acts like a short term momentum indicator.
So it's picking up
what we want it to pick up.
And it's also done fabulously well for us
for multiple years in, in real life.
But we are giving up intuition
at one stage that we used to not do.
So my answer was meant
to be much more subtle
that there are give ups and intuition.
When you move to something like machine
learning, they almost have to be.
Or else again, what are you doing?
I was uncomfortable for that for a while,
so I was starting to do me a culpa
saying that that I slowed us down
and it came out as well.
I used to hate this,
but now I have no job.
The machine runs it.
Which is probably going to be true
in eight years, but not yet.
This reminds me, actually, of something
I wanted to ask
because another big multi year decade
trend is the rise of the multi strats.
And at AQR, as I understand it
you have a multi Strat model in there
but it's more centralized
than some other places.
Can you go into a little bit more detail.
Sure.
They get used interchangeably but
I think that's the difference
between multi strat and multi manager.
Okay.
Multi strat just means
I wrote a dissertation on choosing U.S.
stocks.
We have applied similar things
to stocks around the world.
Two currencies, two commodities.
Two directional bets through trend
following
we think of these,
they are correlated but low.
So we think of
these as different strategies.
And we think a set of our strategies,
is better than a single one.
Or, you know, it's
just the power of diversification.
So we're big believers in a particularly
if you have a common philosophy.
So it's not just fitting the data, it's
it's fitting into an overall theme
of what you believe in.
We're big believers in multi strats.
What we share with multi manager
is that belief in diversification.
Multi manager is what it sounds like
it is.
We are one team building these
we might of course
have little separate teams at AQR.
But will one firm building these.
They are farming it out
to different people.
To be frank if you had told me
their business model ten, 20 years ago,
I would have been very cynical
that it worked if you told me, a what?
The total fees are going to be
when you add up everything
that's passed through, through
and a fair amount of them
and they vary in how quick they do this.
If something's not working for
what I would consider a very short while.
Yeah, they stopped doing it.
And I know there are a lot of low
to medium Sharpe ratio risk adjusted
return strategies that are really good
long term but have bad periods.
So, if someone told me that model
I were to go, you're going to charge a ton
and you're going to throw out
people have a bad two quarters. No.
And there have been people
who've obviously proven me wrong.
And I'm humble about this.
I don't fully understand
why they must be very,
very good at actual selecting the alpha.
Yeah. Right.
And this is something that I, we don't do.
We're, we're internal quants
who build our own models.
We've never maybe be interesting one day.
We've never tried to apply
that to choosing outside people.
But there are plenty of people,
by the way,
I've tried to start
multi manager and failed.
So it's not like
you just apply this charge a ton.
Hire a bunch of
active managers and fire them
if they have a bad two hours.
Just automatically works.
It does seem though, that like talent
is the the thing that's like capping
multi strat expansion, right.
That's the limiting factor.
And and they vary.
But some of the major ones are giving back
money.
There's even if you believe in this model
and I even from afar,
I have to be a believer.
I've seen the results are too good
for too long, in my view,
to have a decent chance
of of of randomness.
I don't exactly know what they're doing.
I'm still waiting for for for Ken
and Steve and Izzy
to send me their exact process.
That that would be wonderful.
Izzy doesn't share it with,
you know, even better if medallion would
send me the exact process.
But I, I respect it,
but the amount of individual
alpha teams that can be out there
has to.
Wall Alpha is finite,
but has to have a decently tight cap.
And and the ones I've seen
are fairly disciplined.
About this. And again it varies.
I can't speak for, for for for everyone
I know we compete
for talent with them
much more than we used to.
We often want
they have non quant parts of what they do,
but they have quant parts of what they do.
And for young quant,
they're often considering an offer for a
AQR and Citadel.
To pick a just one example.
We win our fair share.
We lose our fair share.
I think we probably pay
a little less in the short term,
but we don't fire you
if you have a bad week.
So some people are.
It doesn't seem like a stretch.
I'm not picking on Kenny.
He's not doing that. I'm just saying no.
But we know it's a more cutthroat
investor.
We've done
a lot of episodes on that environment.
We know, like,
they cut bait pretty quickly.
If you, lose money,
I want to go back a little bit
to the connection between sort of.
I machine learning
and interpretability of the factor.
You know,
the quintessential, you know, the risk
is, of course, that you find something
that works strictly from data mining.
Right?
Tickers that start with B tend to rise.
On Tuesday.
And I usually use the CEO's middle
initial.
Yeah, stuff like that.
We know like but you know,
even when you were talking about,
in the very first answer, you're
talking about momentum and you said, well,
there's two reasons that theories
for why momentum can work.
Do you think we've let's just go back
to the canonical at quant factors.
Is there complete consensus
about why these factors were
not at all okay.
They you start out with because
like intuitively like cheap stocks go.
But I my impression is that there's
even still disagreement about why.
Yeah.
You start out with the great divide
and when,
when they split the Nobel Prize
between Jean Fama and Robert Shiller,
my, my co-founder and I wrote a piece
on the cover of Institutional Investor
with that titled The Great Divide,
because they, they were, Lars Hansen
also want a share of it.
I shouldn't leave them out.
But Shiller and Fama were juxtaposes
the efficient market guy
and the inefficient market guy,
which is fairly close to I don't
I don't think either of them are zealots,
but it's fairly close to to true.
So you start out if something has worked
historically and made a lot of money
over, over a long period,
you start out with what you lead with.
Is it data mining?
Let's say you convince yourself
it's not okay.
Let's just put that way. And
and that's a really important thing.
I'm not, you know, Pooh poohing
that stuff.
You got you got to do that.
Then you got to
ask yourself why the two main
contenders
are a rational gene fama kind of market,
where some stocks are riskier than others.
And whatever you're using to say,
go long these and short
these is loading on that risk.
And if something is risky
you should make more for investing in it.
One of the problems is identifying a.
There are some fights within these fights.
What do we mean by risk.
Is risk
beta like the capital asset prices?
Our finance academics
are like every other academic
because if some fights define
your turns, Talmudic at this point.
But yeah, but is is risk battle
like the capital asset pricing model
or the capital asset pricing
model is a beautiful, elegant model
that has failed everywhere
it's ever been attempted.
Is risk more multi-dimensional?
Is risk something like,
what happens in a Great Depression,
which is very hard to, to, to measure?
The other argument is
markets are not perfect.
People make errors
and it's behavioral finance.
So if a cheap stock meets
inexpensive stock because it's inherently
adding some risk that you can't diversify
away, that's a Gene Fama explanation
if it beats an expensive stock because
people went too far, they didn't invest.
They went past the Graham endpoint. Yeah.
And if you can hold it,
you make money when reality sets in.
That's more the Bob Shiller point.
I love Gene, he's my hero.
I have probably drifted from 75, 25
Gene to 7525 bob over my career.
World's complicated one of the hard
parts is everyone wants to win.
But both explanations can be true.
And it can be true at different times.
Life isn't so, so simple,
but those are the two biggies.
But once you get into behavioral
finance now, you can fight about why
what what behavioral bias.
Notice the you could sum up
the two reasons I gave you for momentum
as as under reaction an overreaction.
Overreaction is chasing
right under reactions.
The information came out
didn't move far enough.
And I hopped on that bandwagon.
You know,
you're in a little bit of a dodgy area
when your two best explanations
sound a little like antonyms.
Now the the I'm being intentionally funny.
We know it works.
We're just not sure
whether it's underwrite
literally opposite things
or intuitively opposite things.
We know it's one of them, and there's
some division being a little too negative.
You can actually they're good papers
teasing out,
the under reaction is easier to show.
You can actually show
the fundamentals do catch up.
I think the overreaction
probably kicks in more in bubbles
where there is just more feedback trading.
Again, both explanations can be true
and they can vary in their intensity
over time.
The overreaction might have
a very small part of it, except plus
or minus two years around a major bubble
when it may be the the driving force.
So we have to get really comfortable.
We don't have to have the be all, end
all single explanation.
But if there are a few good explanations
and no real counter ones
and we have really strong
50 year empirical results.
Yeah,
we're
we're okay with taking some bet on this.
You never want to put all your money
on one thing.
That's not a quant thing.
I'm going to try to connect
a bunch of the sort of decade
long megatrends
that we've been discussing.
But, I'm thinking behavioral finance,
gamification of markets, big data, AI,
all those fun things combining into sports
betting, which seems to be getting bigger
and bigger than ever.
And the reason I ask is because,
I was talking to someone in a bar
the other day and they said that
AQR was doing more sports betting stuff.
Someone in a bar was talking about AQR
doing sports.
Yeah, I know it.
Well, it probably says more about the bars
that I'm in,
the people
I'm talking to than anything else.
But yeah, they mentioned that
picturing the Star Wars cantina right now,
I got to tell you so I'm just curious,
is that a thing or are you
maybe interested in the sort of prediction
market aspect of things nowadays?
And Susquehanna is getting into it,
I think.
I think no one again tells
you exactly what they're, they're doing.
I my sense is they are into it
and are good at it.
This is incipient for us.
We are considering and looking at it.
We have a long history.
Toby Moskowitz,
who's a Yale professor and an ECR partner.
A great deal, by the way.
You get paid for two full time
jobs that are 80% overlap.
I'll keep that in mind for
if Toby's listening, just, you know,
you're lucky, man.
He wrote a book
called Score Casting that was all about
sports.
But the sports analytics,
the Moneyball type stuff
looks a lot like what we do.
It looks a lot like people are not pricing
this.
Right, people?
I wrote my most downloaded paper ever,
which is really a little annoying
because it's like the only one
I've written outside of my field.
Was on when to pull the goaltender
in a hockey game, Yeah.
And I wrote it with, with,
a colleague and friend, Aaron Brown.
We built a model, and we came up with.
You should be pulling the goalie.
If you're losing by one
with 5 or 6 minutes left.
Not with two minutes left.
And I'm pretty sure we're right.
We spent a lot of time in that paper
saying, why aren't they doing it?
And making analogies to investing? What?
You know,
when people know the right thing to do
but can't do it
because the public opprobrium,
if they get it
wrong, will be much worse, right.
Like I want they're saying
like football team should go for it
on fourth down a lot more than they do.
And that's like one of these things
that happen.
And they have started to yeah.
There is a feedback
where some of these things are slow.
Some of them are fast.
Baseball has largely absorbed
a lot of these things.
You know, on base percentage was one
of the major insights of of Moneyball.
And nobody
nobody's missing that one anymore.
But we still think, particularly in
the betting markets are not probably
not as rational as,
as Toby's forecasting book.
So we do think there might be
opportunities there, but I don't want to
overstate it.
Just because
I am cynical about online sports betting.
Betting? I got to tell you two things.
I was always a very libertarian guy.
I still think I am,
but a couple things have made me less
libertarian children.
The existence of my children
will make you go,
yeah, maybe people shouldn't be able
to do anything they want
when they turn over.
There should be some rules.
And and, sports betting and maybe
walking down the New York City streets
and getting a contact. I,
the sports betting, we're already,
you know,
some of these scandals
we're starting to see. Yeah.
How do you not have them when, you know,
some of these people make a ton of money,
but they don't all make a ton of money.
And there's a lot
of money in sports betting.
Anything you
do for entertainment is fine
if you do it in entertainment size.
If you go to Las Vegas and you go,
the odds are on the house side.
I'm going to lose $500 over two days.
Probably. If I win, great.
But it's going to be fun.
It's factored
into the cost of a Vegas vacation.
But like, I have a whole bunch of of 20
something year old
mostly guys, in my extended family,
a lot of them are sports bettors,
and they're not even.
It even pisses me off that they're
not even rooting for their teams anymore.
They're kind of rooting for this player
to score on their prop.
It is a strange dynamic.
Yeah.
So do I think that gamification
is highly related?
I think if you go
look at the Robinhood app and FanDuel,
I think you will find they are
and far more similar on their feedback
and how they treat things
and in how their investors do on average,
and particularly sports betting,
you know, investors lose on average
because the sports betting companies
make money.
It's like saying on average
insurance is a bad deal.
You know how I know?
Because insurance companies
are profitable.
Doesn't mean it's stupid to do,
because maybe if it's in a risk
you can't tolerate,
that could be a fair trade.
There's a price you pay for peace of mind,
which is something I've come to appreciate
over the course of ten years.
There is zero chance that the average
online sports bettor is making money.
Yeah, I just have, one last question.
You know, I think if you looked at like,
some particularly crazy times in markets,
here's something that's changed very much
since we started the podcast
first ten years ago.
I think if you look at some crazy times
in markets, whether it's,
you know, 2019 when some of these measures
were getting extreme or just, you know,
the Spac mania of 2021, one theory
that one might have offered is there.
And you just like, oh,
yeah, now we have you know,
we haven't been in for a long time
and yet some of this sort of speculative
mania craze is has not gone away.
How surprised are you
that the move from 0% to, say, 5%
or whatever
didn't have more of a sapping effect
on some of the behavior
and speculative froth, or just sort of
animal spirits in these markets,
I, I am mildly surprised.
Okay.
I left this out, but I actually had three
possible reasons in my paper.
And the third one was super low
interest rates for a long time
for why things can get crazy.
Now the counterargument is once
you break people's brains,
they don't necessarily repair themselves.
Right? Instantly.
So I think it was probably
a contributory factor.
Again, very hard to prove an example of
I'll give you a lot of people
in 19 and 20 when the spreads
between cheap and expensive were here.
We're saying it was a super low
interest rate environment.
And growth stocks
have more cash flows in the future.
Low interest rates
means they're worth more.
We did the math on that.
It explained like 2% of the increasing
value spread.
And in 99 2000
interest rates were quite high.
That's right. There was no zero 99.
So it's not a unified field theory
explanation.
Yeah.
Do I think it helped kickstart some.
And again we're in the soft guesswork.
But I think these are educated guesses.
And I listed it as one of my three.
I think it certainly kicked us off
on some of these things.
Certainly loosen
the bounds of rationality.
Absolutely. Free money.
We'll we'll do that.
I don't think it's not human nature
that all that the takeaways are
and everything comes back.
Would I have thought
it was a bigger effect in going back to,
you know, at one point we hit about 5%
on the ten year, almost 5%.
What?
I thought that would have mattered more.
Yeah.
Only in 2022
did we see one ugly year, over that.
But it has mattered less than I thought.
It doesn't mean it will never matter.
All right, Cliff Asness
thank you so much for coming on.
Odd Lots and kicking off our, ten year
anniversary celebrations again?
Yeah, we joke that was so much fun.
That was great.
Literally the perfect guest.
Literally the perfect guest. One.
Well,
there's so many things that stuck out
from that conversation,
but one of the things that stuck out
from the conversation, it's
this idea about the thing that flips
from the conversation, it's
this idea about the thing that flips
from the conversation, it's
this idea about the thing that flips
the wisdom of crowds
into the madness of crowds.
Right?
And the idea that maybe
the wisdom of crowds theory works
as long as everyone is sort of
isolated and independent
and making their own choice
off of the information available to them.
But it starts to fall apart
when everyone is tied
to everyone else,
and sort of in the same social network.
And, you know, if you think about
one of the dominant themes in markets
in recent years, it has been people
herding into the same positions right?
I found that to be really fascinating.
I think that's where it makes
a lot of intuitive sense.
It probably can explain a lot of things
about the world of politics,
about the world of markets, etc.
this idea that we're all just sort of one
connected global village, as Marshall
McLuhan put it, we're all just
gossiping each other all the time.
We're just constant talk, talk, talk.
No, that's a very interesting idea.
I also do is interesting, the idea of,
length of drawdown versus
depth of drawdown and the, the former
being more painful,
which strikes me, is something I hadn't
I hadn't really heard anyone
talk about that before,
but especially from the perspective
of a manager of other people's money,
it's a very highly intuitive
that makes a lot of sense to me that,
okay, like, yeah, you had a bad quarter
or whatever event you're like,
oh, your ideas are just out of date.
It's been three years
since you've made money.
Maybe time to rethink
some of your fundamentals assumptions.
People are impatient.
That's one thing
I've learned over the course of ten years.
Yeah.
The other thing was the idea of markets
not necessarily
being an arbitrage mechanism,
which I think is very counter intuitive
to the way
a lot of people will think about markets
and this idea that like, well,
sometimes you can't compress the price
all the way to where
it should be rationally or logically
or according to EMH or whatever,
because the reward just isn't
necessarily there to get to that.
Like final 10%.
It's interesting to,
to think about, the sort of link
between patterns and interpretability,
why something works.
And in our conversation,
a couple of weeks ago with Ian
Dunning of Hudson River trading is
like they do not put a lot of emphasis
on interpretability.
There's a pattern and there's some reason
to establish that the pattern works.
It makes money.
The idea that they
then have to also come up
with an economic story about why it works
is not so important to them.
Maybe that's
because it has to do with time frames.
Obviously, Cliff's, trading time
frame is going to be very different
than a high frequency
trading firm like, HRT.
But it is interesting.
And then it's interesting
to think that even in the most established
quant patterns, like why do cheap stocks
outperform
more expensive stocks over the long term?
Right.
Even there, there is dispute
about why this pattern holds,
even though it feels a little bit
more intuitive.
So much interesting stuff here.
It's also, I guess it sort of warms
my old cynical heart, that maybe,
maybe the edge for humans will be,
spotting the regime change, right?
Which, you know, at least there's
something left for us to do
if it's not just pure pattern recognition.
Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
