Number five throughout history is,
man's inventiveness,
particularly of new technologies.
Okay.
And here we are with AI.
And all of those are connected.
They're each related how
what happens when they AI affects
productivity, affects who gets the money
or what happens in job political.
You have to spend money to have a military
and the conflicts.
And then there are trade wars.
And it all transpires pretty much
in the same way over those 500 years.
You can see these cycles in that pattern.
Hello
and welcome to another episode of the Odd
Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
So Tracy, since we've been doing
the podcast for ten years, you know,
trying to talk to
some of the big thinkers, right?
Some of the people who have a little bit
of a perspective on how the world changed.
We say how the world is changed
in ten years,
but it's a little bit arbitrary
how the world's changed and maybe
what the next ten years or 50
years are going to be like,
thinkers thinking big thoughts,
zooming out a little bit.
And I think everyone sort of
is these days.
I mean, it happens to be that we're sort
of celebrating our anniversary or birthday
or whatever it is, but it's just
I think it's just in the air,
you know, like everyone,
I guess
people are always trying to think big,
but there's something in the air right now
where everyone is trying to grapple
with pretty evident change that is afoot.
Well, here's the thing.
The big story in markets is, I sure.
Right.
And whether or not it's in a bubble
and AI is a story
that is not just about finance
and markets.
It's a story
that, like, touches multiple things.
It's a cultural, social
and political story.
So you have people talking literally
about how AI is going to change the world.
It's going to change art.
It's going to change music,
movies, people as well.
Right? So for
some people are going to lose their jobs,
some people are going to get rich.
People talk about it
in this existential way,
both for countries
and companies, to your point.
And if you don't win in the AI race,
then you are literally dead
or part of the permanent underclass
or whatever people say.
And then I think beyond AI,
even if we didn't have this boom
that really started in late 2022,
even if that weren't going on,
there'd be all these other big questions
related to technological competition,
because we already talking about that,
particularly. Yeah, we were China.
There would be all the concerns
about the size of the debt.
There'd be all the concerns
about demographics and so forth,
and the perhaps strain
that changes in demographics
are going to put on the existing labor
force.
So, yes,
you have all of these things going on.
Big picture questions.
Then layer into the AI question.
And I just feel like people right now is
we all feel like we're consumed by these
like sort of forward uncertainty
or questions about the integrity
of elections and democracy
and all of these things.
This sort of the,
the we're at this clearing of the woods
where we don't know which direction
we're going to go.
You know, who's very good at synthesizing
major forces going on in the world?
Well, we do indeed have the perfect guest,
someone who many people turn to
and who obviously has an incredible track
record of talking about things
both in the big picture and shorter
cycles.
We are going to be speaking with Ray
Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater.
He ran it for 50 years.
That's kind of unbelievable.
You know we've seen many market cycles.
We're proud of ten years
of doing a podcast, 50 years of running.
What became the world's biggest hedge
fund is an orders of magnitude
more impressive accomplishment.
So Ray thrilled that you're in here
in studio with us, thrilled
that you're taking the time to chat
with us once again.
Appreciate you. Coming back on Odd Lots.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Congratulations on ten years ago.
Starting this thing, I think of how,
the world has changed in those ten years.
And you want to talk macro?
Listen, I think you're you've heard
you've heard a thing or two about it.
Yeah.
I am global macro.
Global macro.
And I is just a part of that.
Yeah.
It's a small thing in relationship
to the whole global macro issue.
It's, how do you I mean, like,
I know we'll get into all this thing,
but again, like,
it feels like something we're
patting ourselves
on the back on ten years
podcast, 50 years of running a hedge fund.
Like I say it, it doesn't even seem real
that that could even be possible.
I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but.
Yeah.
What did you what? Oh it's fantastic.
Yeah.
You know, I
do you have any tips on longevity
because we're like,
well, we want to be doing this again
in ten years.
Or maybe again,
no one's asking us about in 40 years.
Yeah, yeah. So,
meaningful work and meaningful
relationships.
In other words, do you have
is it your passion
to make it as great as it can be
and a shared passion?
And are you doing it
with people that you care about
and you have meaningful relationships?
And if you've got that, you know,
you've got the energy to keep evolving
and you know, that's what it's about.
I think that's, for me, what it's about.
How would you characterize this moment,
not just in markets
but in global macro, as you point out,
in terms of your experience, your career,
how does it stack up to previous decades?
It's part of and it's part of a long term
evolution
that, I'd like to take you
through a brief macro
perspective of that evolution,
and I'd like to start,
if I could, with a little story
of what would change me.
Okay. When I was 12, I,
in I earned a little bit
of money,
and I put my money in the stock market
because everybody was in the stock
market at the time.
And the people I caddied for
would tell me about the stock market and,
the I bought a company
and is the only company I ever heard of
that was selling for less than $5 a share.
Did you just choose it? Right? It was.
It was the only company that was less
than $5 a share that I heard of.
And I figured if I could buy more shares.
So if I went up, I'd make more money.
That was my logic. Okay.
You know, there are many people today
in the market and I would keep going.
But the silly is the number
of people out there who I believe, like,
have come to think similar logic,
particularly in other areas like crypto.
Anyway, I keep going,
keep going about what I was doing.
I was obviously stuck, stupid.
But what happened was it was a company
that was about to go broke.
Another company acquired it, and when it,
tripled in value, I thought I was smart.
And this is an easy game,
and I got hooked on the game.
Okay, fast forward.
I graduated college, and,
1971,
clerking on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange before
I went to graduate school in the summer.
August 15th, 1971.
President Nixon gets on the television and
says, you're not going to get the gold.
Gold was money then, and you had
paper money, and it depreciated in value.
So, so you're not going to get the gold.
And I walked on the floor of the stock
exchange the next morning, and I thought,
this big crisis money as we know it is
ending, we're going to have a problem.
And it went up more than it
gone up in decades, and I didn't.
That's because I didn't know
what a devaluation was.
So I studied history
and I found the exact same thing happened
in March of 1933, with Roosevelt
getting on the radio and making the exact
same move because they didn't
have enough real money back then.
It was gold, was real money.
They didn't have it.
And that led me to realize
for the first time that I needed
to understand things that happened before
my lifetime, not just my experiences.
So I studied the 30s,
and because I studied the 30s,
I was able to anticipate the 2008
financial crisis
because it was the thing
that was playing over and over again.
And there are
those things that are going on now.
Okay, we'll get into those. Yeah.
But there let me study history. And
so about
6 or 7 years ago, I studied
the last 500 years of history to studying
what causes the rise and decline
of reserve currencies in the empires.
And I said, the last 500 years.
And that brings me to the five big forces.
Let's hear them. Okay.
The five big forces are and they each
have a mechanics to them, a dynamic.
The first is how money,
debt, markets and economics works.
Okay. And we'll get into that.
The second,
by the way, there's a big cycle.
There is
and we can call it a monetary order.
And there's a monetary order
that always happens and breaks down.
And it's part of an arc that has to do
with limitations on debt and money.
And we'll get into that
like a leveraged cycle.
Right. How much debt can you take on?
And what is the value of money?
Money supposed to have?
A store hold of wealth is data store
hold of wealth.
And what is our money?
That's a question
that we have to deal with today.
Right?
What is that money that you can be
an effective store, hold oil.
Okay.
And are we at the end of our debt cycle?
Okay.
That's number one.
Number two related to this money
and who has money and wealth differences
and so on.
A part of the cycle
is that capitalism creates
great opportunities for inventiveness
to be productive and so on.
And it raises living standards
and it raises wealth.
But it raises wealth in an unequal way.
And there are big wealth differences that
naturally come as a part of the cycle.
And those wealth and and values
differences
get to a point where
there are irreconcilable differences.
So throughout history,
there's the left and there's the right,
there's the rich and there's the poor,
and there are those who are liberals
and those who are conservatives.
And throughout history
they have a conflict, particularly
if you have an economic problem.
So that's the second force, right?
The third force is the changing world
order,
the international geopolitical order.
And that has a cycle to it, to you started
and last time you saw it, 1945,
the end of the war.
That war determines who has power.
The powerful determine
what the new world order is like.
And then you have the rising power
challenging the existing power,
and then you change
the dynamic of the world order.
The world order always changes.
The monetary order changes,
the domestic political order
changes, the world order changes.
And there is that arc number.
Fourth force is acts of nature.
Throughout history, droughts, floods
and pandemics have killed more people
and toppled more orders
than the first three that I mentioned.
And number five throughout history is,
man's inventiveness,
particularly of new technologies.
Okay.
And here we are
with AI and all of those are connected.
They're each relate
how what happens when they AI affects
productivity, affects who gets the money
or what happens in geopolitical.
You have to spend money to have a military
and the conflicts.
And then there are trade wars.
And it all transpires pretty much
in the same way over those 500 years.
You can see these cycles in that pattern.
It is pretty incredible listening to this
and thinking, you know what?
It's not just our imagination.
We are in a time of extraordinary change.
We had a global pandemic
that disrupted life
for everyone on Earth in varying ways,
at least to some extent.
We do have this unbelievable technology
that everyone is trying
to wrap their heads around with AI.
We did have even starting, you know,
arguably ten years ago, the emergence
of serious trade tensions with China.
We do see the emergence of their military
clearly getting much more strong, like,
you know, you see all these things like,
it's not we're
I guess we're not hallucinating.
Some big stuff is going on these days.
Well, yes.
And the thing that I would like to,
focus on
is the mechanics of how that happens.
The inter relationships between
where are we in the debt cycle?
Where are we in wealth?
Well, we'll talk about these things
and where what does that mean?
Geopolitical and so on.
And if it's for me, it's like
watching the movie over and over again.
There is connections
and there's a cyclicality
to this, a big cycle dynamic
so that we can step back.
I think everybody looks
at the news item of the day,
and they don't step back and see the big
arc and the cause and effect relationship.
So that's why I'm
hoping we can get into that. Okay.
Well let me try to thread the needle
between the news item of the day
and the big arc.
But when you look at something like I,
how does that fit into your five forces
framework?
Draw the lines for us.
Well, I mean, first of all,
it has tremendous effect
on the economics of it, right?
It looks to me very, very similar
to all the times in history,
that there was great inventions and great
changes such as the 20s, the late 20s.
So a real productive it's hard to change
and maybe the greatest ever.
But right up there.
But let's imagine the 20s. Okay.
So imagine let me take you into the 2030s.
Imagine we need to get like a time warp
soundtrack back in time.
But first time
electricity is going into houses,
and you can have washing machines
and and refrigerators.
First time we have the car.
Okay. First time that we have airplanes.
First time
we have movies that you can go at ten.
First time you have radio.
You used to have silence in your house
and so on.
The the first invention of television
and so on.
Can you imagine it was the much more,
immediate and exciting,
you see the revolutions in those things.
And so there's a mechanic to a mechanism
of which how does wealth get created
and what's the difference of wealth?
And how does a bubble come
and how does a bubble go, in other words,
to distinguish it.
And that's, by the way,
many of those bubbles.
So you I can go back in history
and give you many examples,
but that would be a good example.
So what makes it go up and what is the
difference between wealth and money.
So you get into the mechanics.
Wealth is not money okay.
And so and this becomes very relevant
to, to us now.
In other words what the wealth is,
it's easy to create wealth.
It's because what you do, what you
somebody what what you guys go on.
What? Okay,
but let me give you an example.
Yeah. Okay. You come up with a great idea.
You want to create a unicorn, you sell $50
million of the stock, and you value it
$1 billion.
Yeah.
Okay, now you're a billionaire,
and now that company is worth $1 billion.
But what happens is you actually is it
is it really worth it?
I think every child or teenager is at
some point had this idea right.
I'm going to start a company.
And then Tracy, I was I'm going
to sell her a dollar's worth of share.
But it's just this for and suddenly,
oh, I'm a billionaire.
Like itself is being created suddenly like
I think every everyone has this scheme
at some point in their life. Okay.
But the thing to realize is wealth
is different from money, okay?
Wealth. You can't you can't spend wealth.
You have to sell wealth
in order to get money to go buy things.
Okay. And so how did the bubbles happen?
Okay.
The bubbles happen in the way
that you create these needs for money.
And then the wealth rises
and then there's a need to sell it.
For example,
let's imagine that we put in wealth taxes.
Okay okay.
What's going to happen.
Those are going to need to sell
some of that stock
to be able to get up the cash
to be able to pay taxes.
Right.
Whether it for whatever reason
the need for cash happens
and you want to make a conversion
from wealth to money to be able
to come up with the money and in all the
bubbles, it's work this way.
There's not enough
cash and there's the desire for that cash,
and then you sell it
and the dynamic begins to work in reverse.
So that's all I'm talking about
is mechanics.
Yeah.
So when you asked me the question
and I look at today to today,
it looks like another one of those
okay, who's got the wealth.
And then where is the vulnerability
that can
is this real wealth
or is it accounting wealth.
And then and it's people
make the mistake of thinking,
will it, produce an income over its time
in order to justify that valuation?
That's not what make bubbles okay.
Because the answer to that question
did not change
between 1928 and 1931.
It's not like they found out the answer.
And then they say, okay, that's okay.
It's this dynamic between
wealth and money.
Okay, so there's a mechanics to the way
this happens, right?
And if you understand those
and it goes back a long time,
if you go back to the Old Testament,
the year of Jubilee okay.
How do you deal with debt.
And you have to pay back the debt
because debt is a need for money.
I have to deliver money on my debt.
So it's important
to understand those mechanics.
So actually,
let's get into a mechanical question
for you that and you mentioned
the idea of a wealth tax.
One of the things that you hear a lot
when people characterize the economy
today of 2025, is that a lot of it
is riding on people as well as people talk
about, you know, the k-shaped recovery.
They talk about how people in the higher
income or wealth
quintiles are really driving
consumption, etc.
then we look at these large obligations
that we have, whether national debt
or just the obligations
to care for seniors, etc..
Is this sort of where it comes together
that at some point
maybe we don't call it a wealth tax, etc.,
but where the political entity feels
compelled to go after the, quote, wealth,
the wealth that exists on paper. Yes.
And it's happened over and over and over
again for basically the same reasons.
Okay.
If you look at the 30s, for example,
or it's the same, you need the money.
Okay.
So just watch what's happening. Right?
There's a small group
between 1 and 10% of the population
that,
this is going unbelievably great for.
Right. And then there's the bottom 60%.
The bottom 60% are having problems
being productive and being effective.
60% of Americans
have below a sixth grade reading level.
Okay.
The stock ownership of the top 10%,
they own about 90% of the stocks.
The bottom 60% own about 5% of the stocks.
So we're seeing this wealth and,
and so who are you going
to get the money from?
The way you used to get the money
was that you would borrow the money.
You would the debt would continue to rise
relative to the GDP
or relative to your incomes.
And it would end and then you'd spend.
Well, we're close to not being able
to have that happen for mechanical reasons
that are worth understanding, because I
and I'll get into that in a minute.
But, well, I'll get into it now.
When one man sets
are another man's assets,
and if you're holding a lot of bonds,
a lot of government bonds, you're,
that's a lot of, debt
is that a good store hold of wealth?
And then when you have the political
or geopolitical problems
that are going on conflicts,
then the foreign ownership
owners of those
who owned about a third of the bonds,
may not want to hold those bonds
because they think it may not
be a good store old wealth, either,
because it's being depreciated
or because they may have sanctions.
So if you go back like into the 30s
before, there's always the economic war,
including the financial war in which,
entities are cut off sanctions.
We call them now.
Okay.
So there is this dynamic in which
and it's not just an American dynamic,
it's a UK dynamic.
It's a, France dynamic.
It's a Chinese dynamic
in which we're at a point
where it's not easy to keep doing it
the way we were doing it, by selling more
and more of those bonds in that way.
And so then we'll look at look at it.
You can't borrow like it used to.
Number two, you can't tax.
Okay.
Politically, it's, I went to Washington
speaking leaders on both sides, and so on.
And the answer is, you know, we, I said we
we gotta get the budget down
to, 3% of GDP.
And you can do that if you take it for,
this a little bit of this and that,
and you can do that.
And but what happens is
the answer I get is and it's the same
in the UK, it's the same in France, same
or all around the world.
You have to understand that I can't
I have to make one of two pledges or both.
I will not raise your taxes
and I will not cut your benefits.
Okay.
So now you can't borrow.
It's not that much you can't borrow.
Yeah.
You can't keep it up as it was.
You can't raise the taxes.
Politics okay.
You can't cut the spending okay.
So there we are.
It's different from where you were
ten years ago when you okay.
The world is very different from.
I was thinking about your 10th year
anniversary.
Okay. 2015. Yeah. Okay.
So think about how different the world
is as a function of these five forces.
Right. That's what it looks like, right.
Absolutely.
So can we talk about this in a U.S context
specifically since you brought up DC.
But it feels like the U.S
especially has changed in ten years.
So rising inequality
the deficit is higher than ever.
And we also have an administration
which seems to be
redefining America's place in the world.
How does that fit into, again,
your five forces framework.
And I guess I should bring up
the debasement trade as well,
because this was a big theme
earlier in the year of the.
Yeah, yeah.
The, the idea that, you know,
people don't want to be in the dollar
because they don't know
what's going to happen with the debt
or because they're worried about sanctions
and limits on currencies.
It's all the same, isn't it.
And it's all interrelated. Right?
I mean, okay, and it's all understandable,
right?
It's all you have a financial limitation.
You have large wealth gaps.
You reach the point,
that,
you don't want to negotiate.
You're sick and tired.
The electorate is sick
and tired of hearing these excuses.
They want populism.
So populism arises from this.
And populism
of the left and populism of the right.
So they greater polarity and they say,
I don't want to compromise my things.
I want it delivered.
So win for me, okay.
Win for me,
my values, my way of operating.
And therefore you have
irreconcilable differences.
And so if you look at history, the people
who arise are of the same character.
Oh, you have you produce populists
because of that,
that sort of circumstances
while the world is changing.
Okay. So what is the place in the world?
Okay.
We can't sustain what we were doing
before.
Think of the relationship, let's say,
between the United States and China
by way of example. Okay.
The dynamic of, Chinese will sell,
inexpensive, their goods cost effectively.
Americans buy it,
send them the money, the Chinese
take the money and they put it into bonds.
That dynamic can't exist anymore.
First of all, they don't trust each other.
Everybody's worried.
Okay, the United States will worry. Can.
I can't be dependent on imports
from China.
The Chinese worry
that I can't be dependent, that
you're going to give me my.
I'm. I'm a predator.
Am I going to get my money?
If you study history, maybe
because of conflict, I can be, a problem.
You lose the middle class
because they are the manufacturers
you've shipped manufacturing to China,
and so you don't have the man.
And you say we have to bring back
manufacturing.
We need self-sufficiency.
Okay, so now self-sufficiency
means you cannot continue
that dynamic anymore, right?
And then what do you do
when there's the challenge
the the wars that are not the military
wars, the trade
war, the technology
war, the geopolitical influence war.
It's not like you can go to
what was imagined in the post-World War
Two period
that the United States said, we're
going to have a multilateral world order.
We're going to have a United Nations,
and we're going to go vote,
and we're going to have, a world Bank,
and we're going to have an all these world
organ, a world Trade Organization,
and so on.
We're going to have those types of things.
Well, that's that's naive.
We're past that.
So we switch from a,
you know, a multicloud or a world order
to a unilateral world order
where power matters, right?
That's what's going on. Right.
So, Joe, I'm I'm kind of laughing here
because I'm thinking back to both of us
studied international relations, right?
Yeah.
In college I'm thinking how much time I
spent studying international institutions.
Yeah, like the World Trade Organization
and the U.S..
Yeah.
Totally irrelevant.
Now, can I ask you a personal question?
Not that personal,
but we heard you on the podcast in March,
and you were talking about
the scale of the U.S debt and so forth,
and it was, you know, this was on the eve
of when the big tax cut negotiations
were happening.
It was clear that the white House
wanted to push a tax cut.
And as you mentioned, you went to DC and,
you know, you were fine.
There are ways to get the budget
deficit within 3% of GDP.
This is not an insurmountable task.
But, you know, right now,
there does not seem to be any meaningful
change in the,
spending or deficit trajectory.
Did you find it personally demoralizing?
You were concerned in March.
Now here we are talking on November 14th.
You know, the last eight months of your
if you got more concerned, did
that experience have any effect on you?
I've been in the markets for a very,
very long time.
I'm a hyper realist.
Okay.
Have you everything
as a learning experience.
And so when I don't
I don't get demoralized.
Okay.
I find it interesting and informative.
So I was disappointed.
I mean, it would have been better
for everybody if we could work together.
And we can also find,
even if we couldn't agree on how to do it,
just do it proportionately across things
to make those changes,
to try to bring that in order.
But it was a good reminder of where we are
in the political cycle
to understand the nature of that.
And so that's what it is.
You can't be idealistic.
Yeah. You have to be realistic.
I consider myself to be someone who every
new experience is a learning environment.
And that's why I love the job that I have.
And everything is new and interesting.
But occasionally things of the news
get to me a little bit
more than I wish they would there.
There's a
there's a feeling in the stomach.
Yeah, yeah.
And it's like,
this is not just an intellectual exercise.
This actually is stakes for but for me.
Listen,
I've been doing a markets 50 years.
Yeah okay.
And a lot of emotion
can get in to the way.
So how do you is it the meditation
like meditation has a big effect.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. Yeah. You. No no no you're right.
Is this like a key element of separating
the emotion from the learning?
That's right.
The ability
this meditation I would say would be
maybe the single most important reason
for whatever success I've had.
I mean, meaning
it has given me an equanimity
to step back, to see the arc, to accept
there's a life cycle.
Okay, I'm 76 years old.
I know where it is.
People, you know, there's
all sorts of things that we all go through
and so on to the ability
to step back a line,
the subliminal, that subconscious mind
which has an effect, and the intellectual
mind to be able to do that
while still feeling the emotions,
but being able to, look down on
how does reality work and almost,
even things we don't wish were true.
You know, it's like,
the tooth fairy or Santa Claus.
Okay, we wish that we exist,
but we can accept the fact that they don't
exist, don't have our preconception,
and just learn.
Here's reality
and how to deal with reality.
Meditation has helped me a lot to do that.
And but I think that's the right approach.
Well okay.
So if you meditate
and you recognize the arc of history,
what do you actually do
with that information.
Especially if you're trading or investing.
Because I think
part of the problem when we have
these conversations is we talk about like,
oh, the debt keeps going up
and there is political polarization.
And it just seems like there
there aren't many solutions
to those problems, and there's not much
we can do with that recognition.
Oh, I see, I just disagree.
I think that what I think you'll ask
yourself how does it work mechanistically.
What effect
can I have on how it's handled.
How any difficult situation is handled,
like being in debt
and having these conflicts and so on.
How do you handle it?
Well for the, for the greater good
and whatever.
And then
or maybe you can't change the world,
but you can deal with it yourself.
And what do I do to take care of myself,
my family and so on?
And you can, you can deal with that
by first understanding.
How does it work mechanistically?
That's that's why I wrote these books.
The last book is how Countries Go Broke.
Not it's it's the mechanics of it.
And so you could see it as indicators
and you can do the calculation
and you can line it up
with what's happening
and you know where you are,
you know how you can store your money.
How do you what's a store hold of wealth.
So you can have a skill
and you can understand what's going on,
and you can understand
how to position yourself
and or
and you can maybe bring it to Washington
and or other places, and you can you
you can bring it to Washington.
But it's the mechanics of the podcast,
okay?
It is not an it is not an ideology.
Okay.
So separate yourself from there are
different views and different preferences.
And there's the left and the right.
And I can't tell you
whether the left or the right.
That's a different question.
But whether you're of the left
or you're of the right,
they're dealing with the same mechanics.
And if you understand those mechanics
then you as a policymaker can do it.
And now we're in a situation,
of course, that policy of politics
is part of that mechanics. Okay.
Now we have to accept the politics
and then we have to say,
where are we going
and how do we best deal with that.
You can do all of that.
You said the thing of, you know, sometimes
our truths that we don't want to exist,
and maybe we try to turn our face or
imagine the truth
and they think that's bad.
Well, yeah. Right.
And so you don't want that to be bad.
No, no, it's just
reality. You know, there's,
one of the phrases that
the, the CCP has over in China
seeking truth from facts.
And it sounds very obvious,
but it is very hard to do it.
It can be hard to just look at facts
and actually observe the world as it is,
rather than the observer.
I think the world that we want to be
part of it is a habit.
So mean.
I mean
I think that if we're, if we're taught
the emotional like
What is real.
Yeah.
Reality is interesting.
Reality is beautiful in a sense.
If you take evolution and things die
and and things happen, they may not.
It's like if you recognize that
and you think that way
and it's all part of that evolution
and you and you can get that
in your mindset, that's so much better
than being able than saying,
I don't know, dying is bad.
I mean, give that as an example
or this thing is bad.
And when we approach it
that this thing is bad and so on,
then it's that fault of that thing
rather than, okay,
how does the system work?
And then how do we
then deal with the system
to get the best outcome
because we could deal with the system.
For example, the mechanics
today has a lot to do with,
how people deal with each other, right?
In other words, if we were collectively
being able to solve these problems and,
and put the collective
well-being ahead,
we would have a lot less wars.
We'd have a lot better
solving of problems, not the ideological.
And I have to fight
for that kind of thing.
So it's an approach that approach
could be taken on and toward.
This is
the idea that you can't control the world,
but you can control your reactions
and you can influence the world.
People together, world leaders,
if they were to try to say,
what is the common good
and how do we work it out mechanistically
so that, okay,
somebody is going to give here
and somebody is going to give there
and then we
but that'll produce a better outcome
than if we go to war or, you know, there's
there are better approaches
that leaders of countries.
Yes, there's leaders of countries
can do this.
And also individuals can do this in terms
of what they're going to be with others.
Have you ever considered
going into politics or policy?
Is that something
that. Not since I see more.
Because you know what?
I think it's I have great admiration,
great appreciation
for the people who take on that life
that, we have a challenge in terms of even
how the system works,
because there are so many people right now
who, have opinions,
want to fight for those opinions,
and they determine the votes.
Then then they create people
who are acting out
and all of these things, you know, it's,
it's not an effective I do think, though,
it's very difficult to be successful.
I do think, though, I am worried
how often young encounter intelligent
people, thoughtful people, etc.
and when you ask them if they ever
consider elected office immediately,
the answer is no.
Like it's it's
actually a little bit disturbing.
It is disturbing how quickly
basically anyone
sane would have that it
anyone who's sane was a.
Of course I would never go into elected
office or never pursue elected office
because you look around,
the environment's miserable,
but then you think, well,
what kind of filter does
that have on the actual leaders
that we end up do get?
That's a reality. It is a reality as well.
But no, I know, I know, but like,
what do you think about that filter?
And you think about, okay,
you want quality leadership etc.?
Well, look,
think about anyone who seems like
normally say and immediately says,
of course
I would never go into elected, right?
So let's just look at that for a minute
and take it through
the perspective that I'm,
trying to convey.
We look at that and how it's different
from 10 or 20 years ago
and how the people are.
So the first thing we should do is,
besides saying that's terrible,
we should look at why is that okay?
Does that make sense? Yes. Why?
I we can answer that. We.
It makes sense. Yeah.
There's the clash, the
the party alignment.
Be analytical.
Okay.
And then say okay what do we do.
Okay. What does.
So maybe you're contributing
into good things in your way and try
you know, but you have to be practical
if you're going to have an effect there.
You have to have an effect
on the people who have their hands
on the levers of power.
They affect things.
Not us chatting away. Yeah. Okay.
And the voters may be, but
what can you do to help to bring about it?
Or what do you need to do yourself
in order to do that?
So you have to be analytical and and,
mechanical
about what the cause effect relationships
because it comes back to the mechanics
cause effect relationship.
If you understand the cause effect
relationships, like how politics works,
how the populations work,
you can be analytical in doing that,
but also the causes
you can get ahead of the game
because the causes happen
before the effects.
And if you know
the cause effect relationship
and you could see the causes and imagine
the effects, you can be ahead of the game.
Is there anything in your, you know,
very long career experience that didn't
match up with previous examples
or cycles in history all the time?
Okay. I mean,
in 1971,
in other words, I had a preconception.
I walk on the floor of the stock exchange
and, and I realized,
wow, okay, now I go to the 30s
and I learn something, right.
What about a Bridgewater?
I mean, any interest I can get.
But what I've learned
is that whatever success in life I've had
is also more because I know how to deal
with what I don't know than anything.
I know.
Okay, I learned that, okay,
I know some things,
but what I don't know about what
the future is and so on still very large.
So I learned how to, diversify.
I learned how through
financial engineering
in terms of controlling,
I could through diversification,
improve my return to risk
ratio by a factor of five.
But by keeping the return
the same and diversifying,
well, that will reduce the risk
without reducing the returns.
That's mechanics.
But that came from my knowing that.
I don't know that I can't be sure.
Okay, so when you're analytical that way
and you view these things as a puzzle,
then there are all these puzzles
and you have to solve the puzzles.
But if you can do it
calmly and analytically and so on,
you can engineer the mechanics
or how you're dealing with it.
That's what I mean by principles
for dealing with reality.
And what about it?
Bridgewater was there ever
and like times that yes it all the time.
The moment all the time.
You know I knew what I wanted.
Okay. That that was that's an advantage.
If you start a company you can make it
what you want, what the culture should be.
And, you know, in one
sentence,
I wanted meaningful work and meaningful
relationships through radical truthfulness
and radical transparency.
Okay, so I really believe
that if you can have
meaningful work, in other words,
something you're in to the mission
and you have great,
relationships
with people who are in that mission.
Maybe it's you two, with, lots. Okay.
I don't know what it is,
but if you're on that mission
and you have a great relationship
and so on, that's magical.
But you also need to have
radical truthfulness.
In other words, if you don't think he's
doing a good job and he or vice
versa or something, and Tracy looks like
it's true, she looks like a team.
You guys put together a team
we actually buddy.
No, I'm not picking on you.
No, no, no it's not.
It's gonna say we're pretty honest people.
It occurs to me.
Let me finish
answering the question. Okay?
Because I haven't gotten
to the challenges, okay, I want that.
I believe in that truthfulness and so on.
So then, there are trade offs.
Not everybody likes that.
Okay? Not everybody.
You know, there's an aversion
to looking at mistakes.
There's,
an aversion to looking at weaknesses.
How do you get over that.
Where in other words.
And so I, I, I have to face
these questions and deal with it.
That's what led to my first book,
Principles of Life and Work.
But in other words,
when we recognize that knowing
our weaknesses is a great thing,
it's a great power.
So how do you objectively
get to the notion
of knowing your strengths and weaknesses?
And I created personality
profile Test there,
for your listeners,
go to it's a free test.
Principles.
You you can go online
and learn about your nature
and what your nature is
and how you deal with things.
So there's the constant encountering
reality,
what your goals are
and what your aspirations are.
And so I encountered that.
I thought that's your question
and I encounter that.
And then you realize
you encounter obstacles and then you view
those obstacles as puzzles as you
that you have to solve
in order to get there,
because you have choices.
And if you make better choices,
you get better outcomes.
So that, I'm giving that as an example.
So recognizing that
it's not the best place for some people
and that other people couldn't
possibly work anywhere else
because they can't get the meaningful work
and bring fellowship
or the truthfulness,
you know, the truthfulness,
the political politics
that goes on in companies and so on.
These people,
a lot of them can't work anywhere else
because they can't get that truthfulness
and that that spirit.
So yes, it's constantly
finding these things out
through
discovering of interacting with reality
and then solving puzzles
and developing principles.
So it occurs to me when you're talking
about this like it's become very popular,
maybe in the last ten years,
but probably a little bit longer.
People love to talk about
corporate culture.
This place is a good corporate culture.
This place is a bad corporate culture.
What is the corporate culture
of Silicon Valley?
What is the corporate culture
of the big banks, etc.?
I mean, you clearly were very one thing
you're clearly very ahead of
the curve is just thinking about this term
corporate culture.
You know, there's a term and
it's just like, what do you want to do?
How do you want to behave with each other?
I mean, we don't have to even use the word
corporate culture in any relationship.
If you have a marriage, if you have
friendships, if you have partnerships,
it's you have to face the question of
how do you want to be with each other?
Yeah.
Well, how do you actually shape
the culture then?
Well, two ways.
I know what I believe is best
and whatever, but I'm not actually sure.
And then I go through the question
and answer.
I believe I do have an idea. Meritocracy.
That's a different from values, different
people could live their lifestyles,
different kinds of lifestyles,
freedom of choice to operate that way.
But I kind of know what I believe is best
and what I want, and then I
and then I have, openness to, debate.
Is that right? Is that the best?
Because if you have an idea meritocracy,
where you can have anybody debate
anything, you know, anybody at Bridgewater
at any time could
could challenge me on anything.
And I felt the obligation for everybody
to hear that exchange
of why I think this is best and not,
and then let people make decisions
or enlighten me
when it comes to that trade off,
because otherwise
they wouldn't be invested with you,
you know, to take it on a practical level,
how do you deal with, in an environment
in which people are encouraged
to be transparent and to be critical,
even, senior people or junior people?
How do you avoid the pitfalls
of bullying and mobs?
Because I think
this is actually very relevant.
When you think about politics,
we think about social media, etc.
how do you how do you prevent
and environment of openness
from turning into mob psychology?
I'll tell you how I do it.
And and just also accept the fact
that any of these things,
you're not of the most perfect.
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
But first of all, you go
first, you go and you paint the picture
of how it should be.
Okay?
And you know that not anyone's view
is, objective.
Okay.
Is your, point of view,
and your point of view may be different
and highlight that.
So I if you go to, Ted talks,
there's a Ted talk I gave and it shows
how we created.
I created a tool called the Dot collector,
which everybody
has put as we're having meetings,
putting their thoughts in.
And so I. Yeah.
And the reactions
so we feel free to give your thoughts,
bring it up
including critical thoughts or not.
Then you get to what I call
believability weighted decision making.
How do you get about whether this person
is a better decision maker?
What the strengths and weaknesses
of the person of each person is
so that they can play their role?
Well, if you draw,
if you set that out as your aspiration,
you'll find ways of doing that.
Like there may be tests, there may be,
you know, how do you pick your doctor?
You know, you have you met
one who has an appointment open?
Yeah, that's pretty much it. Know.
But do you know what?
You get three smart people. Yeah.
The three best or the two best.
Get a second opinion
and you want to make sure.
So it's the same thing.
And picking people there.
And how do you do that.
You want that.
And then you have to let people know that
that's good for them and it's good
for the organization that it's fair
okay, that the process is fair.
It's not one person making a pronouncement
of one another person is like that.
As you go through the cases and you say,
oh, that case happened that way
and it happened again,
what do you think? And so on.
You work your way.
Once you have
the notion that the system is fair
and you're just trying to get at
what's true and what are people
strengths and weaknesses and so on, you're
making great leaps toward that,
as distinct from most companies
in which they don't talk about that.
And, you know,
or they're behind the scenes.
Like, I had a rule,
if you talk behind somebody's back
three times or more, critically,
you're out.
Okay.
And but if but you're always free
to bring it up and deal with it
because let's deal with it.
Let's just try to find out what
the problem is and deal with it that way.
So on the bullying, they can tell the
bully, okay, you can tell the book why?
Why did you do that? Why is that that way?
But in any case, that was my path.
Whether you choose a different path,
I think you have to agree
that getting a truthfulness.
Team sports teams have to do this right?
So. Yeah.
How do you select. I'm sorry.
You're not doing a good job at that thing.
You have to deal with it.
And you have to make the team great.
It's like that. Well,
so now I have to ask,
what do you think about multi strats
and the pot shops?
Because the culture that you're laying out
where everyone is sort of talking
to each other
and challenging each other seems very,
very different to the multi strat model.
That seems to be much more predicated
on, you know,
little teams that are sort of off
and doing their own thing.
There's different ways to play the game.
That's a totally valid way
to play the game.
And maybe,
maybe the it's just a totally utility way.
In that way.
There is is it
effective in making the investment
decision
can be very effective for lots of reasons.
I can digress into uncorrelated return
streams, many operations,
blah blah, blah, blah, blah.
That could be very effective.
And, it may not be effective of creating,
the meaningful relationships
and those types of things.
Therefore,
you're going to have the continuity
and a competitive business problem.
In other words, people will go for,
you know, which is what we've seen
a little bit of that,
have a little bit more money, a little bit
more of they're not in it together.
They're not sharing their lives.
They're not sharing their mission
together. Yeah.
And so on.
So maybe it's a totally fine way
for the investment management,
but it's not a fine way
for building a 50 year old.
I did this I built a 50 year
old organized nation while others
it is raised a question
like in those environments
like what is the franchise value.
Because what happened.
Right.
What seems to be there's there's model
which has produced extraordinary returns
for some investors.
You do get the situation
in which everyone is sort of a mercenary
and everyone
and then and everyone, you know,
dangled these big paychecks and bonuses
and you're it's hard to build.
Yeah, it's hard to imagine that
environment building a 50 year franchise.
I think I think it's
I think it's not going to last.
And it's particularly in the era of,
and I say more similar.
Okay.
I think that you're going to have
and I'm going to try to help it have,
I enabled,
ability
to be an independent investment manager.
Okay. Like Uber. Okay, okay.
Uber's got a technology that they take
the individual, they plug them into that.
That technology and whatever.
And everybody can do that.
In a sense I think we're going
to be moving more into that direction.
So what is it?
But I,
there's that's a path
that we can go down and,
that's a whole other path.
Well,
you said you're going to try to help it.
What does that mean?
Are you working on something?
Well, I might I'm building my own ability,
and I want to
share how, people can do certain things.
That's it.
But you don't think this model
this because it's been very hot.
Again, talk about things that have changed
ten years, ten years ago
we were not talked about multi strand
talk about fund to fund the fund of funds.
Much more back then you're a little
it sounds that you're skeptical
that this model will endure
much will endure.
Well I think in every.
But I'm just looking at mechanism.
Yeah. Yeah yeah. Talk about okay.
So what creates cohesiveness.
You have to have the need for cohesiveness
okay.
What is the cohesiveness.
What is the commitment okay I think
when we help each other I believe in
how people can help each other.
Okay. Are they helping each other?
Can they be better?
And that's the question isn't it. Okay.
So when we're thinking multi stripe
if everybody's there and you put it
together as that, that could be done
technologically very easily.
Right. So the going to stick it together.
Okay. What is the relationship like.
Okay.
To be on the mission together
and to have relationships
and so on is invaluable
not only in terms of effectiveness
in terms of doing job because different
people have different skills
and you do that together,
but it is also psychologically rewarding.
The greatest source of happiness.
Okay, this is this is,
I think, an important thing.
Studies of happiness all around the world
and so on shows that,
income past a certain level
does not bring a higher level of happiness
once you get the basics
taking care of that.
The greatest source of happiness
is community.
Yeah. Do I have a sense of community?
Okay.
People who are there for me
and I can help and I work for that.
That's a powerful force
and it's very rewarding.
Okay. It was it. My thoughts?
I have one more question.
Since we're being very retrospective here
and nostalgic in some ways,
do you think if you were setting out
today,
do you think you would have been able
to create a Bridgewater
in the current environment?
Yeah.
How would you I think I think
and I think that, everybody can
and that entrepreneurship
is, is so clearly an example
that it is the greatest power.
Money is not the greatest power.
Money will seek out the people,
the entrepreneur,
the person who has the talent get
have enabled people, and that money
will go to them to make them.
That's that's what investors do.
We try to find
those people are going to make
these new things wonderful things happen.
So the talent of an individual
to attract money,
to attract the resources
that are necessary for success.
Okay, then we can do that.
Now the question is how are you?
Okay.
Are you the next
one of those who's got the ideas
and can put that together
and make the case for your supports
that I need this, this and the other thing
and grow and become better?
Yes, I believe that we're in a period
of time that that's very, very good.
You need different resources than you did.
You know, the way I did it is
I play I was a kid, I played the markets,
I like the markets.
Then I'm one day
I make a pitch to somebody,
you know, I did my thing.
And then the world Bank
gave me a $5 million account.
And, okay, world
Bank gives me a $5 million account
because we were just
talking about markets,
and they gave me a $5 million account,
and that's started me in the institutional
asset management business.
Then the next one gives me the account,
then I get to build
a track record,
then I get to build the things I need.
I mean, right now,
if you're running an operation,
it can be expensive
because you need compliance department.
You have to deal with the regulatory
things.
You have a lot of those things,
but you can find your way.
Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater.
Thank you so much
for coming back on the podcast.
So good to be back.
And congratulations again
for your ten years. Keep it up.
Thank you so much.
We'll, looking forward to our 50th year.
That'll be it.
Oh man. Let's see if we can pull that off.
Anyway, that was fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Tracy, 50 years is insane.
I mean, that's insane.
Like, in any field media,
it actually is it.
But when I like when I said
that was the end, when he said
he rents
that almost seems too hard to wrap my head
around that you could run something
for 50 a a hedge fund,
that it could survive that long,
like this incredible track record.
Yeah, well,
he said he was 76 years old, so.
Yeah. No,
I just started it very, very young.
Yeah, it's a 26.
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm kind of in.
I'm in a strange mood now,
and I like introspective and retrospective
and thinking about the future,
but I do think, you know, it is true.
He pioneered a lot of stuff like culture.
Yeah.
And we hear a lot of stuff
about Bridgewater's very, special culture
and distinct culture.
Culture? Yeah.
You know, I'll say a couple of things
is just that, you know,
I feel like as a as a middle aged man,
you know, you start to like,
change your view on the world
and you're like,
wait, does everything seem a little crazy
objectively,
or is it just my state in life?
And what am I losing?
Yeah, no, I think it's important.
And I actually would like the answer
in some way to be that I'm losing touch,
like, oh, everything is totally fine.
I'm just sort of like aging
sort of out of touch these days.
And so I don't know whether I find it
reassuring or not that no, like,
these are really big things
that are going on
and all of these things,
these big historical forces,
we've got a bunch of them all
sort of converging at once.
Will they are big things going on.
But I think one comforting thing,
and this is why
I think people tend to read history
in times of change.
Sure.
Because you feel very unsettled.
You feel very insecure.
And so you look back at history,
you start seeing these patterns
to raise point, and then you're like, oh,
okay, maybe things will be all right.
But also you can read
certain history books and think,
oh God, things are going to be terrible.
Yeah.
No, I know it's it's all about the book,
I suppose, about the time frame.
I mean, the other thing
and Ray mentioned is in terms of legacy,
I do associate, Bridgewater
specifically with,
teaching a lot of people
about the sort of specific ways
that you can achieve great returns
through leverage plus diversification.
Right,
which is sort of like the magic that,
that they brought to it,
which is we're going to diversify.
And you typically associate
diversification with,
I'm going to sleep better at night, but
I'm a sacrifice return and that's fine.
But this idea is like, well,
maybe you can like sort of,
you know, achieve both through leverage.
And of course it worked, really well. And
yeah, the results speak for themselves.
Also interesting.
Here's a comment about I'm
glad you asked this question.
Sure.
Because that was very interesting.
Well, this idea
that relationships are like personal
camaraderie is the glue that sort of holds
the whole thing together.
I think if you talk to people in that,
in that world, yeah,
like the money can be great, obviously,
but I never, ever
sounds like a particularly satisfying
life.

and it does sort, you do sort of wonder
whether the balance of power
or whether the
how sustainable this model is.
It's been a while since we've done a multi

we should revisit it
because there have been some developments.
Yeah. All right. Shall we leave it
there. Let's leave it there.
