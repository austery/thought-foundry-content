- How can all the diversity
and, sort of, seeming order
that's out there in the world
emerge from a process
dependent upon chance?
It kind of works like a staircase.
Chance invents, and natural
selection propagates
that chance invention.
Our immune system works on
the very same principles
of mutation and selection
as evolution at large
does in the big world.
Cancer is truly an evolutionary disease,
meaning that it is a disease that results
from the exact same evolutionary
process we're describing.
So while Darwin's is the
most famous figure associated
with the theory of evolution,
Alfred Russel Wallace played a key part.
And in their day,
this was referred to as
the Darwin-Wallace theory.
I'm Sean B. Carroll,
evolutionary biologist
and author of several books,
including my most recent,
"A Series of Fortune Events:
Chance and the Making of
Planet, Life, and You."
- [Narrator] Chapter one, how life works:
the staircase of evolution.
- So evolution, what it really
means is change over time.
So we wanna know how that
change occurs over time.
And there's two dimensions
to this process,
and it kind of works like a staircase.
And one process is mutation,
and that's the rise in the staircase.
Those occur by chance.
If mutation didn't happen,
all things would be identical.
So you need mutation
to make individuals
different from one another.
Those mutations are genetic
changes, changes in their DNA.
If by chance that changes a property
that favors reproduction,
survival of the individuals,
it will spread, and that's
the selection process.
And that's, sort of, the
run in the staircase.
Chance invents, and natural
selection propagates
that chance invention.
And once that process has happened,
new mutations can then
be added on top of that,
maybe even changing the
character a little bit further.
And that's another rise in the staircase.
And if that's working
better, that's gonna spread.
And so it's the cumulative
set of mutations
and the cumulative process of selection
that takes us up that staircase.
So that staircase could have
goodness knows how many stairs,
but it has to go through
this stepwise process
of individual mutations arising,
sweeping through the population,
new ones arising, sweeping
through the populations.
It doesn't go from the base of the stairs
to the top of the stairs in one jump.
And this is hard for people
to get their heads around
because they may think
about that first step.
And it's, sort of, hard to imagine,
you know, how do you get
something as complicated,
you know, as individual organs like an eye
or a wing of a bird or things like that.
But time, immense time.
The speed with which some
new adaptation spreads
through a population
depends upon the magnitude
of the advantage it conveys.
If it's about a 3% advantage,
meaning that about 103 individuals survive
for every 100 that don't have it,
well, that will take about
a thousand generations
to spread through the population.
Now, I'm saying generations
because it depends upon the
generation time of the creature.
So if the generation time, for example,
if humans is 25 years,
it'll take 25,000 years
for that to spread through
the human population.
But if the generation time is 20 minutes,
you can work it out.
It'll take, you know, 20,000 minutes
to spread through, which is much shorter.
It's a matter of generations
because reproduction
is a generation-by-generation process.
It's really important to underscore
that these mutations occur at random
without any consideration
of whether they're good
or bad for the organism.
It's the external conditions
that are gonna sort this out.
So some things can be
good for one creature
and bad for another, okay?
So for example,
a color change might make
a creature more invisible
in some settings, more visible in another.
Some mutation may make it better
adapted to warmer climates,
less well adapted to
colder climates, right?
So it depends on these
external circumstances.
So the mutations arise at random.
Well, what about those
external circumstances?
Well, we'd say it's
the abiotic conditions,
the physical world that
the creature is living in.
Well, that's also
generated a lot at random.
Tectonic plates moving
across the earth, vulcanism,
all the things that shape
the conditions of life
are often due to physical
processes of the earth.
Of all the many thousands
and millions of things that
creatures have come up with,
I have a few of my favorites
that I think really exemplify
this process of adaptation.
And one of my favorite sets of creatures,
there's some fish called icefish.
They live in the southern
ocean around the Antarctic.
And they live in water
that is actually below
the freezing temperature of fresh water.
They're right around about
29 degrees Fahrenheit,
is the ocean around the Antarctic.
And that's a challenging environment,
so challenging, for example,
that you may know that there's
ice flows around there,
and if little ice crystals
just get into the bodies
of these fish, they'll nucleate freezing.
They'll freeze like fish sticks.
So they need to have a mechanism
that prevents them from freezing
at that cold temperature.
And what they've done is
they've evolved antifreeze.
Certain proteins in their bloodstream,
made in very large quantities,
suppress the ability
of ice crystals to grow
inside their bodies.
And so they're able to tolerate
that subfreezing water of the Antarctic,
and other fish aren't.
So what's happened over the last 30
or 40 million years is that a lot of fish
that were once swam in those oceans,
sharks and rays and all
that, they're all gone.
They're extinct from those waters.
We find them in more temperate waters.
But it's the icefish
and the antifreeze-bearing
relatives that those waters.
And the icefish have also
come up with something
that's incredibly nifty
and shocked naturalists when
they first discovered it,
which is if you open any fish you know,
slice it open, you're gonna see red blood
because that's something that
animals with backbones have
and have had for almost 500
million years on this planet.
But you slice open an icefish,
their blood is colorless
'cause they've gotten
rid of red blood cells.
So they don't even have a mechanism
for carrying oxygen actively
in their bloodstream like we do.
They've ditched red blood cells,
and the reason they've
ditched red blood cells
is that those low temperatures,
it makes their blood too viscous.
And that's a disadvantage.
To the icefish,
it was an advantage to get
rid of red blood cells.
To the rest of us, it's instantly fatal.
So it's a good illustration
of just how conditional
these adaptations are
that to exploit the resources
of the southern ocean,
you gotta make antifreeze
and get rid of your red blood cells,
where the other parts of the world,
antifreeze would be irrelevant,
and your red blood cells are necessary
for every second of life.
Let's talk about speciation.
That process of variations
helping to adapt,
that's the process of adaptation.
But speciation is the generation
of two species from one.
What does that take for there
to be two species to form?
And we know, and this is
where in the island biology
of Wallace and Darwin help,
is that they were seeing
species on different islands.
Well, islands provide some isolation,
and that isolation means
that those populations
aren't exchanging genes.
Over time, each of those populations
will accumulate mutations
that exist in one population
and not the other, vice versa.
Well, those could become
genetically distinct enough
that if those things
were ever to come back again in contact,
they may not be compatible
with one another,
and they'll be species.
So how long does that take?
Well, it's been estimated
for big animals like mammals and birds,
that works out to roughly
be about 2 million years.
But 2 million years is still a long time.
And you've probably heard, for example,
that there's now very strong evidence
that Homo sapiens, our species,
mated with Neanderthals
a distinct species.
And what's really happened
in the last few decades
is that for biologists,
that species barrier has
become much more porous
than we first thought it was.
In the old days, in Darwin's day,
species were characterized
as really distinct things,
and we didn't think there
was any kinda shenanigans
going on between them.
But we now understand
that it's a much more porous situation,
that for some period of time
as populations are diverging,
they can get back together.
And things that we humans
might call distinct species
can often interbreed.
Another common question
or idea is that, you know, for example,
if humans evolve from apes,
why are apes still around?
Well, important thing is to understand
that evolution is a splitting process.
So the family trees keep splitting.
So the human part of that tree
has had now its own separate history
from the eight part of that tree.
We shared a common ancestor
about 6 million years ago.
But apes have gone on living as they do,
for example, in the old world.
And there's a great diversity of apes,
of course, still here,
baboons, orangutans, gorillas,
chimpanzees, et cetera,
while the human branch has gone on
and has its own evolutionary trajectory.
It's not that evolution is linear
and that everything new replaces the old.
It's a splitting process.
And so that's why the tree of life
has just split into
enormous numbers of branches
from common ancestors.
Two of our main records of
evolution are the fossil record
and the DNA record.
The DNA record is largely
only accessible to us
for living creatures
and maybe some creatures
that have lived over
the past million years.
You know, do we have every brick?
Do we have every intermediate?
No, 'cause, you know,
extinction takes away 99.9%
of all species.
So if there was no extinction,
we'd have a perfect record
of evolution, right?
We don't have the DNA record
of dinosaurs, for example,
but we've got the fossil
record of dinosaurs.
So we use these two records
to, sort of, reconstruct
the history of life.
That allows us to
reconstruct the evolution
of things that are fairly complex.
Let's take something like a
walking limb from a fish fin.
This evolutionary process transpired over,
eh, 20, 30 million years,
about 380, 390 million years ago.
To do that, we have to get fossils
that represent the various
stages of evolution
and see, how did all the bones change
so you went from a swimming
fin to a walking limb?
And the fossil record, by
now, is pretty darn good.
Then we can go to creatures
that have fins, fish,
and we go to creatures like
amphibians that have limbs,
and we can figure out how do
those genetic programs work,
and where are the differences?
Now, we don't have
every detail sorted out,
and that would be
incredibly time-consuming
and expensive to do,
but we certainly have the general picture
that we understand how the
bones changed in history
and we understand how the
development of program changed
to generate a limb in the place of a fin.
And that's not something Darwin ever had.
That's something that we really only had
for the last 20 to 25 years.
So evolutionary science
keeps building on this huge foundation,
and what we get is an ever more detailed
and ever more confident
record of what's happened.
But what's at no doubt
is that this process,
mutation and selection,
mutation and selection,
is the universal, going
on in every population
of every living thing every day.
In fact, this process of mutation
and selection seems so universal
that we think it must
have played a vital role
at the origin of life.
And that anywhere where life exists
in the universe, it's operating.
So evolution is this
vast and rich process,
and you know, we've been
trying to understand it
for 160 years.
And in the course of that,
there's some misunderstanding
in just how it's communicated,
where I think there's some conflict
between the terms we scientists use
and, sort of, their common understanding.
And one of those is theory. We
talk of scientific theories.
Theory is much higher on the
hierarchy than, for example,
a fact or just an observation.
A theory is assembled from
lots and lots of facts
and independent lines of
evidence that, sort of, cohere.
So a theory is really,
sort of, the top category
of scientific idea,
where, of course, you know, in the street,
theory might mean that's my best guess
or that's just something
that I'm conjecturing.
The way we talk about
those kind of conjectures,
we call those hypotheses.
And that when hypotheses
have been rigorously tested,
that's what can contribute
to making a theory.
So folks, when we speak of theory,
think that we're still
very tentative about,
you know, the truth of evolution.
That's not all the case.
The theory of evolution,
which has grown enormously
in the last 160 years,
is a huge body of observations, evidence,
and facts that are
consistent with one another,
that come from completely
different sources of science.
And that's what gives it its power.
We, of course, wish that maybe
that connotation of theory
that's, you know, more of
the everyday connotation
would be better understood.
- [Narrator] Chapter
two, how our bodies work:
the staircase of self-defense.
- Now, here's something about
the staircase of evolution
that's very little appreciated.
It's going on in every one
of our bodies every day.
It's keeping us alive.
And that's because our immune system works
on the very same principles
of mutation and selection
as evolution writ large
does in the big world.
Every day, we are exposed
to all sorts of potential pathogens:
bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites.
We've gotta fend these off.
And by the time we're full-grown adults,
there are actually more
bacterial cells living on
and in our bodies than
there are our own cells,
trillions and trillions of microbes.
We've gotta keep these in check,
or, of course, we'll
suffer and potentially die.
And that's the job of our immune system.
And our immune system operates
on the very same principles
as the staircase of evolution.
It's a staircase of self-defense.
And the most remarkable
property, our immune system,
is it seems to be able to recognize
as foreign virtually anything
that can come at us out of nature,
including entirely new pathogens
that didn't even exist
in the human population.
And how do we do that?
Well, it involves a process
based on mutation and selection.
And the way this starts,
I'll just describe it
starting with a single cell.
So you have billions of cells,
but these cells have different
molecules on their surface
that when they are complementary
to molecules on the surface of a pathogen,
they're activated, they're engaged.
And when engaged, they
multiply very rapidly
such that over a period of about a week,
one cell may become billions of cells
and start to pump out large quantities
of chemical weapons known as antibodies
that thwart that invader.
These billions of cells
over our immune system
are actually clones,
clones that are subtly
distinct from each other
that have unique ability to
recognize something else.
Now, that something else
could be any variety of things
on an invading pathogen,
but once they recognize that,
that clone gets amplified,
can grow to be many, many, many cells
in the course of a week or so.
That first wave of defense
is decent, but not optimized.
There's actually a mechanism
to make those chemical weapons,
the antibodies that cell
makes, even more potent,
even more deadly to essentially
the invading pathogen.
And that's because there's
a specific genetic mechanism
that mutates the antibody-encoding genes.
Leaves the rest of the
genes in the body alone,
but just the antibody
genes start undergoing
a process called hypermutation
and, therefore, generating all
sorts of antibody variants.
And the antibody variants
that recognize the pathogen
better are selected for.
So here we go. We're
climbing the staircase.
So this hypermutation process,
we now select antibodies,
and this can go through various cycles
to make ever better and better antibodies.
So we're really zeroing in
on this particular pathogen.
So late in immune response,
say, for example, the second
week you're recovering
from a flu virus,
your immune system is ever more potent,
ever more powerful in defeating its enemy
because it's up that staircase.
Eventually, a staircase, sort of, splits,
and some cells are set aside
as what's called memory cells.
They're there to be used
when this pathogen is encountered again.
Other cells continue
to make the antibodies.
Now, this is the marvelous thing.
Y'all are familiar with a
phenomenon where, for example,
you don't get measles twice,
you don't get chicken
pox twice, et cetera.
Why is this? Immunological memory.
That even if 50, 60,
whatever number of years ago
you might have been exposed to that virus,
your immune system is still poised
to attack it again if you're exposed again
so you don't even get the infection.
This system is called adaptive immunity,
much like the process of evolution
of mutation and selection is adaptive.
It really only exists in this form,
in animals with backbones,
long-lived, generally larger animals.
And you can see its utility
because the longer your lifespan,
the greater the chance
you're gonna re-encounter
a particular pathogen.
If you're a short-lived
mayfly or something like this,
you don't live long enough
to see the same thing twice.
There's not that kind of immunity.
So lots of animals including,
you know, simpler things like
worms and flies and all that,
they have what we call innate immunity.
They have ways
that, sort of, put barriers
up against pathogens.
But this adaptive immunity only exists
in creatures with
backbones, with vertebrates.
And it's pretty elaborate in us,
in mammals, animals with fur, et cetera.
But it's pretty well developed
even in things like fish and sharks.
Inside our bodies,
the timescale of this
process is very, very fast.
It's more like what we described
with respect to microbes
'cause it starts with cells
and cells that can
multiply pretty frequently.
So a lot of evolution can
take place in a short time.
Most of us are, sort of, familiar
that, you know, most
infections don't knock us down
for more than about a week.
That's when our immune
system eventually, sort of,
catches up and overtakes the pathogen.
So that gives you a sense
of the timescale it takes
to mount the response,
expand that response
to the point where it
overwhelms the pathogen,
whereas out there in the world,
sort of, a battle between
predator and prey or whatever,
that may go on for hundreds
of thousands of years
before there's, sort of, a winner.
Same process, much more
rapid timescale in your body.
How is it possible that we can
recognize virtually anything
that the world will throw at us?
And fundamentally, one
of the problems there
is, sort of, a coding problem.
How can one make all the
different kinds of antibodies
that could recognize all the
different possible pathogens
that, you know, a species might encounter?
And the solution to that
required understanding
how antibody genes are encoded in DNA,
something we weren't able
to do until the 1970s or so.
And what that's revealed
is that we mix and match
pieces of antibodies in a way
that we can generate millions
of combinations of antibodies.
And it's now estimated
that we may be able to make
about 10 billion different antibodies.
And you might go,
"Well, that sounds, sort
of, impressive, but okay."
Well, here's the thing:
In our entire genome, all of our DNA,
we only have about 20,000 genes.
So how do you make 10 billion antibodies
when there's only 20,000
genes to begin with?
And this is the brilliant
trick of the immune system.
It makes antibodies from
short little gene segments
that it mixes and matches in millions,
if not billions, of combinations.
So the trick of combinations
is that it's just like in a,
you know, if you can take
a deck of cards, right,
and you have, you know, five
cards you draw from a deck,
there's lots and lots of
different combinations you can,
even if you have only 52 different cards.
And so from a modest
number of antibody genes
on the order of a few hundred,
by mixing and matching them in pieces,
we can generate enormous
numbers of antibodies.
So the immune system,
even with all its powers,
can still be, sort of, beat to the punch.
There's still pathogens that can kill us.
And this is why we vaccinate.
And we understand, in vaccines,
generally what we're giving
is a little component,
usually a non-living component,
not the virus itself,
not the pathogen itself,
but maybe just a molecule
that represents that pathogen.
And we're using that to
prime the immune system.
So we're activating the immune system
so it goes through some of
those steps on the staircase,
establishes memory, and
is poised to respond,
should we encounter that pathogen.
And by being vaccinated,
by being immunized,
that can save lives,
certainly save the suffering
of a particular disease,
shorten its course,
save us days off work,
whatever it might be.
But this is why we have
these vaccine strategies
and we seek ways to give our
immune system a head start
'cause if we don't vaccinate,
then we're at risk of suffering the damage
that pathogen causes
unless or until our
immune system catches up,
feeling lousy, or in some cases,
there's lots of morbidity
with these infections.
One of the most notorious ones
in human history is the smallpox virus,
which killed hundreds of millions
of people in human history
and even tens of millions of
people in the 20th century
until we came up with a vaccine.
And there was a global effort
to vaccinate virtually
every human on the planet.
And that eradicated
smallpox from the world
so that now we don't even
vaccinate for smallpox.
But that was a virus that moved faster
and caused greater pathology
than our bodies could keep up with.
- [Narrator] Chapter
three, how cancer works:
the staircase of mutation.
- So we understand this
evolutionary process
is what drives our adaptive immune system
and protects us against
enemies from without.
But it turns that sometimes the enemy
is coming from within the house.
And I'm speaking specifically of cancer.
And cancer is truly an
evolutionary disease,
meaning that it is a disease that results
from the exact same evolutionary
process we're describing
of the evolutionary process
in the external world,
of the evolutionary process
in the immune system.
Cancer forms in the same way,
and that is mutations take
place in individual cells
that if they convey some growth
advantage to those cells,
those cells may outgrow their neighbors,
and additional mutations may happen
so they outgrow their neighbors further.
And that's what we define as
a tumor, a population of cells
that is now growing unregulated
relative to its normal neighbors.
And that's a threat
because that unregulated growth can lead
to spread throughout the body,
can lead to organ involvement,
et cetera, and death.
But the other concern is,
is that cancer gets larger,
some of those cells are gonna
get yet additional mutations,
and some of those cells
are gonna get yet additional mutations.
And so as cancer progresses over time,
that tumor is less and less
like the cell it started from,
and the tumor itself is
more genetically diverse.
And that's giving us a real
challenge therapeutically.
So there is a staircase of cancer,
and the way to understand that
is that our risk of cancer
is really age-dependent.
The incidence of cancer
goes up really significantly
as we get older.
And think for a moment why that might be.
And what that is
is it takes time to climb
that whole staircase.
So later in life,
individual cells have gone
through more divisions,
they've had more chances
to accumulate mutations,
mutations that give them
some growth advantage
over other cells.
And so our risk of cancer
grows really significantly
as we get into our 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.
So that tells us not only is
it an evolutionary disease,
it's a genetic disease.
It's mutations taking place in genes
that somehow disrupt the normal process
of controlling cell growth.
So a huge interest has
been, what are those genes?
How do we find them?
How does this all work?
We first got a hint that
cancer was a genetic phenomenon
when scientists first started
seeing chromosomal changes
in cancers, chromosomes
that were broken and fused
and things like this
and that all the tumor cells
would have those broken chromosomes
or tumors that arose
independently in different people
would have those rearranged chromosomes.
And that gave us a hint,
okay, something genetically is going on.
But the crucial thing was to
identify, well, what genes?
Well, thanks to genomics,
thanks to gene cloning,
we now know that there
are about 20,000 genes
that essentially run the human body.
And we've identified 150 of those
that, when mutated, can
contribute in some way to cancer.
We'll call those drivers,
and those drivers split into two classes.
One class we'll call accelerators
because when they're mutated,
they really accelerate
cell multiplication.
They also have the name
oncogenes, promoting cancer.
Another class of genes,
they serve as brakes,
they hold back proliferation,
But if they're disrupted by mutation
and we no longer have
their braking function,
then the cells can grow out of control.
So just like an out-of-control car,
out-of-control self-proliferation
can even be due
to a stuck accelerator or a broken brake.
It can be due to oncogenes
that promote cancer
or tumor suppressors
that would normally suppress that cancer,
but they've been disrupted by mutation.
So scientists have banded
together across the world
to build this, sort of,
catalog of driver genes.
And so they study the state of these genes
in all sorts of cancers.
And there's some really,
really clear insights from doing this.
And the first is, well,
it's a multi-hit process.
Usually, any cancer has
disruptions to multiple genes,
might be three, four or five, even seven
of these driver genes.
And if we look at cancers
that arrive in kids
and compare that with
cancers that arise in adults,
there's a really profound distinction.
When we look in kids,
we see there are very
few mutations overall
in the DNA of the cancer cell,
but they'll be in driver genes.
And you don't see many other mutations
that have taken place
that are different, say,
from Mom and Dad's DNA.
And that's because a young child,
its cells have not gone
through that many divisions.
It's not accumulated very
many other mutations.
It just so happens the
mutations that occurred
were in these critical driver genes.
It's horrible, heartbreaking, bad luck.
But the longer we live, all of our cells,
whenever DNA is copied, mutations occur.
Now, most of those
mutations have no effect.
They're sprinkled among the
billions of bases that we have.
But every now and then, one of
these driver genes gets hit.
Well, the longer we live
and the more divisions our
cells have gone through,
the greater the chance that
there have accumulated mutations
and eventually hit one
or more driver genes.
And once they hit a driver gene,
if that cell starts to
out-proliferate its neighbors,
well, then those cells
in turn may be going
through more rounds of
division, more mutations.
And so now, essentially
the snowball is rolling
such that by later in life,
we have cells that have accumulated
a number of driver mutations,
and many of our cells at least
have one driver mutation.
It may not be pathogenic whatsoever,
but a lot of our cells will
have mutations in them,
some of which could
eventually be a problem.
So understanding that cancer
is this, sort of, disease,
this interplay of mutation and selection,
there's really three factors
that can contribute to
the formation of cancer.
First is just bad luck, that
the small number of mutations
that are gonna happen anyway
just happen to hit driver genes.
Really, that's the explanation
of pediatric cancer.
And the kindest thing you can do
to any parent whose child is
struck is to reassure them
that there was nothing
they did to cause it
and nothing they could
have done to prevent it.
Then there are lifestyle issues,
like tobacco use and sun exposure.
They'll increase the risk
of particular cancers,
lungs because that's where the smoke goes,
and of course, the skin
'cause that's what's being
exposed to the sunlight.
And the third is just age. It's time.
The longer we live,
the more divisions our
cells have gone through,
the more mutations have happened,
and the more all the environmental things
that we've been exposed to
have had chance to work on us
so that later in life,
our cells are carrying loss of mutations,
and we just hope that none of those cells
have, sort of, that unlucky
combination of mutations
that will make it an uncontrollable tumor.
So I think there's a few pillars
of how we're combating cancer now
that's really different
from how we did it before.
Now, for prevention,
we're looking for these mutations.
So you've seen, for example,
a product like Cologuard
where a stool sample can
be sent to a company.
Well, they're looking for
mutations characteristic
of gastrointestinal cancers
in that fecal sample, okay?
So that's early detection.
And we know that the earlier
you can detect cancer,
the better shot you have
of counteracting it.
The second pillar is to know those cancers
and to realize that different driver genes
are mutated in different cancers.
So instead of treating
breast cancer as a monolith,
we now subtype breast cancer
according to the mutations
that exist in an individual's tumor.
So it's really important
that the genotype,
meaning the genetic makeup of a tumor,
is analyzed when that is first diagnosed.
That will shape the treatment course
because the other thing
that oncologists are doing
is they use different drugs,
different regimens to
go after these cancers
is to study which things work against
which genotypes of cancer.
So we're now, I think,
classifying and categorizing cancers
with much greater degree
of sophistication.
And then there is the
specific therapy side.
All sorts of drugs have been designed
to go after those mutated genes,
so to specifically target
what has gone wrong in
an individual cancer
because of the mutation
of a particular gene.
Some of these drugs have
been spectacular success.
Some are doing a good job at,
let's just say buying time
in the hope that the cancer be contained
and, you know, managed over
the longer period of time
and treated more as
like a chronic disease,
not necessarily eliminated,
but at least managed.
Only in the last about 25 years
has this really been possible,
but the practice of this
has really grown enormously
in the last about 15 years.
And there's all sorts of new
drugs under clinical trials
at any given moment,
again, trying to give a
much more specific therapy
to the particular alterations
that had happened in a
given individual's tumors.
Better prevention, better
diagnosis, better therapy,
this is driving cancer rates down,
certainly for certain types of cancers,
and hopefully going to
drive survival rates up
over the long term.
These parallels in how life evolves,
how the immune system
works, how cancer arises,
at one level, they're startling
because the connections aren't so obvious,
but fundamentally, they're
operating on the same process,
this mutation and selection.
But of course, mutation
is a random process,
and it's really hard to
get our heads around,
how can all the diversity
and, sort of, seeming order
that's out there in the world
emerge from a process
dependent upon chance?
Yet there you have it.
Whenever you have variation
and you have competition,
natural selection operates
and gives us the variety of life.
In the immune system,
chance is being exploited.
You think, "Well, we
can't leave the defense
of our bodies against chance,"
but here we're exploiting chance.
Now, of course, cancer
has its root in chance,
the unlucky mutation that hits a gene
that could throw a cell
out of balance with a body.
That evolutionary process
we've been discussing
is one of error and trial,
whereas humans, sort of,
think like engineers.
We think of what we want as an outcome
and how we can get there, sort
of, in the shortest distance.
And we may use some trial and error,
but we really try to minimize the error,
whereas really these
evolutionary processes
start with error.
They start with a random change
and then try those things out.
And I think it's just been hard for us
to get our heads around that,
yet the more we understand this
and all of its manifestations
and the immune system
and cancer are too later realizations,
we see that this process
is a fundamental biological process,
random genetic variation
and the sorting of that variation
through natural selection.
- [Narrator] Chapter
four: The untold story
of Alfred Russel Wallace.
- So about 15 years ago
on a visit to the University of Cambridge,
I happened to visit the archives there
where they hold a lot of
original materials from Darwin.
And to my astonishment,
they brought out and placed
into these sweaty hands
a copy of one of the
early manuscripts that,
many, many, many years later,
would be modified into
the origin of species.
After Darwin got back from his voyage,
he was pondering these ideas,
and he decided to write
them down in essay form.
And by 1844, he completed a 230-page essay
that's fleshed out a
lot of his basic ideas.
He wouldn't publish anything
on evolution for 15 years.
That essay, I think, was lost for decades
and found under the steps of his house.
So when it was presented to
me, all over the manuscript,
including on the back pages,
there were drawings by Darwin's kids,
they had been using it like scrap paper.
It was a spine-tingling moment for me
because this was really the birth
of one of the biggest
ideas humans have ever had.
And I'm grateful that they
found it under the stairway
at Darwin's house.
So while Darwin's is the
most famous figure associated
with the theory of evolution,
Alfred Russel Wallace played a key part
and deserves huge credit,
both for his ideas and
for his enormous effort.
So really important to understand
that the prevailing idea at the time
to which Darwin subscribed
and most British scientists subscribed
was, we'll call special creation
or the theory of special creation.
And that was the idea
that every species was
specially created by God
and, sort of, placed, or at
least emerged in the habitat
or in the place on the
globe that best suited it.
Now, what started to shake
that theory in Darwin's
mind and in Wallace's mind
was in the course of their journeys,
particularly when they
visited archipelagos,
strings of islands,
each of them observed
species on different islands
that were slightly
different from one another.
Now, Darwin, and this is
just a twist of his story,
after nearly five years at sea
and having made a full
voyage around the world,
they were about to turn
from the southern tip of
Africa back up to Europe.
But his captain, who
was, sort of, obsessive,
decided he wanted to do
some more measurements
in South America, so he went
back across the Atlantic.
And Darwin was, at first, just crestfallen
that he wasn't headed home,
but he needed to make
good use of that time.
And he started to take his notebooks out
and review what he had seen,
but also, sort of, annotate them.
And he thought back to
the Galapagos Islands,
and he thought back to these mockingbirds
that he had seen on different islands.
And he saw that on different islands,
the Mockingbird were slightly
different from one another
in their feather patterns
and things like that.
And he thought,
these islands were within
sight of one another,
just 50 or 60 miles away from one another.
If a creator was placing species,
sort of, perfectly adapted
to each place, why would
these mockingbirds be
just slightly different from one another?
Now, Wallace's story is more dramatic
because Wallace, after
four years in the Amazon,
really at the breaking point,
decided to return to England
with specimens and whatever
ideas he had collected.
And on his way home, his ship caught fire.
He had to get into a lifeboat.
The ship sank right in front of him
with all of his specimens.
And he was in an open
lifeboat for 10 days,
hoping to be picked up.
And he was picked up,
eventually made his way back to England.
You'd think after that experience,
he would've sworn off all voyaging.
But two years later, he goes back out
and does an eight-year voyage
across the Malay Archipelago
and collects tens of
thousands of more specimens.
He noticed, for example,
that birdwing butterflies,
these beautiful, incredibly
brilliantly-colored,
large butterflies were slightly different
from island to island.
They both thought in the
theory of special creation,
these islands all looked alike.
Why would there be just
slightly different species,
island to island?
And it struck both of them:
because species could change.
Species weren't stable,
they weren't immutable,
as the theory of special creation argued.
They in fact changed.
And this opened up the big question then,
or at least the daring question,
of, are species the product
of natural processes
or divinely created?
And they thought this was strong evidence
that species change naturally.
They change according to the
conditions they encounter
in different places.
And the islands were crucial,
sort of, laboratories
for understanding this
because the volcanic islands
of the Galapagos look very
similar to one another,
but the creatures were a bit of different.
The islands of the Malay Archipelago,
very similar foliage and all that,
but the creatures were
a little bit different.
And the only way they could,
sort of, reconcile that
was to say, well, the
species were changing.
They weren't fixed.
They weren't immutable.
And as they worked further,
they thought about some other patterns.
They knew about fossils.
In fact, Darwin discovered
some really interesting fossils
on the coast of Argentina.
And through correspondence
back home while he was at sea,
he realized these were,
sort of, larger versions
of animals that lived in
South America at the time.
So he found, for example,
giant ground sloths.
You know, huge, like,
eight-feet-tall ground sloths,
much larger than the living ones.
But he realized, hmm, those
are extinct creatures.
What's the relationship between
the extinct and the living?
And he's starting to
think about that genealogy
between the extinct and the living.
And Wallace is also becoming
aware of these fossils
'cause he's reading now what's coming out
from the first studies fossils in Britain
in the first part of the 19th century.
They had also each read this work
by an economist Thomas Malthus.
And Malthus emphasized
that there were limits on populations.
He thought about the
growth of populations.
And Malthus said that, you know,
disease and famine,
that limited, for example,
the growth of populations.
Well, Darwin and Wallace
being out in nature,
they understood that life was very tough.
They understood that, really,
life was a battlefield,
a contest, and that far
more young are produced
than can survive to adulthood.
And what's uncanny is when
you look at the writings
of each of these individuals,
Darwin's notebooks,
Wallace's draft manuscript,
they use the same language.
They describe life as, quote,
"A struggle for existence,"
exactly the same words,
unbeknownst to each other.
And they talk about
variations, however slight,
and that they could be favored.
And that led Darwin to coin
the word natural selection.
They'll be selected for in nature.
And the things that are disadvantaged
will be selected against.
And Wallace said
essentially the same thing,
that one could imagine if
there's a slight advantage,
that slight advantage will be passed on,
generation after generation.
So Darwin, for 20 years,
is back home in England.
He's well-known
because right after he did
the voyage on the Beagle,
he wrote a book that we call today,
"The Voyage of the Beagle."
And it was a popular
read. It's a great read.
It's still a great read
today about his travels.
And he was an eminent naturalist.
Wallace was an unknown.
He was from far more modest upbringing,
and he was really paying
his way on his voyages
by selling a fraction of the specimens
that he was collecting.
So he was thousands and
thousands of miles away
from the center of science in England,
and he wasn't connected really at all.
So Wallace, by 1858,
has a pretty good idea
that life changes, life evolves.
And he writes up a very short account
of his thinking about how that works.
And he decides to send
it to the one naturalist
with whom he struck up a correspondence
who thinks might appreciate it.
He sends it to Charles Darwin.
Well, this event rocks Darwin,
because Darwin has not gone public
with his theory of evolution.
And now here's this
far-away correspondent,
7,000 miles away from England,
who, in just a few pages,
essentially the same idea that Darwin has,
that Darwin's labored
on for about 20 years.
Well, Darwin's friends rally
and decide that the best thing to do
would be to read Wallace's paper
and an excerpt from Darwin's work
in front of a British scientific society
to, sort of, put both of
these ideas out in the public.
Darwin wasn't there.
It turns out Darwin had suffered tragedy.
He was burying Charles
Jr., one of his sons,
on the day this paper was read.
And Wallace was 7,000 miles away,
didn't even know it was going on.
It really didn't make much of a splash,
not much attention was paid.
But the next year
is when Darwin published
"On the Origin of Species,"
and that's when everyone paid attention.
The response and acceptance or rejection,
particularly to Darwin's
"Origin of Species,"
'cause that's the book everybody
could put their hands on.
It sold out in its first printing,
it was reprinted quickly,
it was translated into other languages,
American versions were made.
So people who are interested
in science, biology,
natural history around the
world could get their hands
on Darwin's ideas.
So the reactions were
a very wide spectrum.
Thomas Huxley, who was one
of Darwin's close confidants,
sort of, thought, "You know, wow,
why didn't I think of that?"
He thought it was, you know,
compelling and sort of obvious.
But I think one thing to
appreciate with Darwin
is that his book is extraordinary
in that he also presents
and analyzes the critiques
of his own theory.
I mean, imagine that.
This is just something that
human beings don't generally do.
If they've got an idea,
they're gonna put out all the evidence
in favor of their idea
and they're usually not going to present
to the opposition all the
evidence either against it
or all the evidence that's missing.
But Darwin did this in a masterful way
and basically often saying
things like, you know,
if a particular thing was found,
it could crush my theory.
Or if my theory is true,
this would be true,
but there wouldn't
necessarily be any evidence
weighing on that.
So it was a masterful presentation.
And I think it made it
very accessible to people.
They understood the strengths
and weaknesses of the theory,
and then new discoveries
could be interpreted
in light of that theory.
And as some new discoveries,
particularly from the fossil
record, came to light,
well, that gave a lot of power
to Darwin, 'cause Darwin,
at the time "Origin of
Species" was published,
the fossil record was pretty skimpy,
but Darwin made some
really strong predictions
about what should be found,
for example, in the fossil record.
And one of those was transitional forms.
If the tree of life has evolved
in the way that he said,
there should be forms
that are intermediate
between existing forms today.
And two years after the
"Origin of Species,"
a fossil called Archaeopteryx,
which has got mixed characteristics
of both birds and
reptiles, was discovered.
And I mean,
you couldn't have drawn
anything better than that fossil
for supporting Darwin's theory.
So I think the reception of
the scientific community,
some of it, at first,
was, you know, positive,
but there were long, long holdouts.
There were career long
holdouts against Darwin
among even very eminent
natural historians,
biologists, and scientists.
And that holdout
was really for reasons
we'd all recognize today.
While Darwin didn't, in 1859,
didn't comment directly on
the evolution of humans,
he did later in 1871.
Everyone knew that humans
were gonna be a touchy subject,
because for at least a couple millennia,
the thinking was that,
you know, man was created
in God's image, not descended
from some previous animal forms.
But clearly Darwin's theory
would be interpreted to say
that, no, humans, just
like every other animal,
evolve their anatomy and their physiology
from preexisting forms.
And some scientists
held out on that point,
both perhaps from their
own viewpoint of faith,
but also, I think, because of
some pressures in the academy.
Darwin was on the short list
to be knighted when the
origin of species came out.
Well, he never got that knighthood.
So, you know, this was an idea
that many people found repulsive.
They were really worried about
the societal implications
to, sort of, take the creator
out of the immediate picture
of sort of, you know,
tending to human affairs.
And that's, of course, still a struggle
that exists to today.
And, you know, scientists, you
know, being part of society,
it was not universally,
you know, accepted,
far from it.
Where Wallace really
finally grasped the scope
of what Darwin had been
working and thinking
was in 1859 when "The Origin
of Species" was published.
And he received a copy of
"The Origin of Species."
And he read it and reread it.
In fact, Wallace's own copy
is in the Natural
History Museum in London.
So we can understand, sort of,
his reactions in real time.
But I think one of the
most poignant things I know
in the history of science
was Wallace's put his thoughts
in reactions in a letter
to his close friend in
confidant, Henry Walter Bates,
with whom he had first
traveled to the Amazon.
And Wallace is just gushing
with admiration for Darwin.
And he says, "I never,
given any amount of time,
I could have never come up
with something as massive
and compelling as Darwin."
And he said, "I don't
think any branch of science
has ever been created by
an individual such as this,
such as Darwin."
So Wallace was in awe
of Darwin's synthesis,
which was "The Origin of Species,"
but they were mutually
generous to each other.
Darwin, right off on page
one, acknowledges Wallace
and Wallace's ideas.
And Wallace later, for example,
when he writes his first major book,
he dedicates it to Darwin.
They are, you know, mutual
admirers to the point
where, for example, Wallace
is gonna be a pallbearer
at Darwin's funeral.
And in their day,
this was referred to as
the Darwin-Wallace theory.
It's only later that biologists
and historians just started
kind of forgetting about Wallace
and crediting Darwin.
Now, there might be reasons for that.
Darwin came from a wealthy family.
The University of
Cambridge did a great job
at, sort of, amassing Darwin's collections
and Darwin's writings.
And so we just have a
better historical record
of everything that Darwin did.
But at the time, it was
the Darwin-Wallace theory.
And I think by today's
scientific standards,
given the genesis of this theory,
the theory certainly of natural selection
by the two individuals,
we would be crediting both of them.
And you know, it's just
the unfortunate sort of,
you know, accidents of time
that people kept talking about Darwin
and Wallace, sort of,
faded to the background.
But I really feel in
the last 25 years or so
that Wallace has seen,
sort of, a renaissance
and that people are much more aware
of Wallace's huge contributions.
And then Wallace outlived
Darwin by 30 years.
So he was a really important figure
in the discussion of evolution
'cause, you know, this
was a brand new science.
It had relatively few
advocates at the beginning,
certainly people that
really understood it well.
And so Wallace played a huge role
in getting people to help
understand these ideas.
I think if Darwin and
Wallace were alive today,
they would be so overjoyed
by the detail with which
we understand the process
that they first figured out.
They knew variation was important,
they knew variation was the fuel
of the evolutionary process,
had no idea how that variation arose.
Now any biologist can
point right to the DNA
in a newly hatched creature
and say, "There's the mutation.
That's what's gonna make the difference."
So our understanding of the
material basis of evolution
is phenomenally strong.
And I think that would be
extremely gratifying to them.
But these other manifestations,
the role it plays in health and disease
were nowhere in Darwin
and Wallace's minds.
So I think that would,
again, further astound them
that this process they figured out
had such widespread ramifications
beyond just the natural world.
What we've seen are striking parallels
in how life evolves, how
our immune system works,
and even how cancer arises,
this process of mutation and
selection, the staircase.
So really, the process
that Darwin and Wallace
had that first insight into
is a universal process.
Wherever there's variation,
wherever there's competition,
selection will operate.
For me personally as an
evolutionary biologist,
this just underscores
the explanatory power
of evolutionary theory
and the importance of understanding
the evolutionary process.
You might think, "Well,
the evolutionary process,
let's just leave it to the
scientists to worry about it."
But I think in our daily lives,
you understand that this
is why we vaccinate.
This is why we are now
developing these strategies
against cancer that we,
of course, hope everybody
will be able to benefit from.
That's a long way from the Beagle voyage
of 160 years ago.
But that's fundamentally where Darwin
and Wallace have brought us.
