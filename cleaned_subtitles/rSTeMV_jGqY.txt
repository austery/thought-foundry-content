Hi, this is Daria. Today we're talking about the future of tech jobs and focusing specifically on the next 10 to 15 years. There are some very clear trends we can bank on even now. I will be talking about the roles that already show very strong momentum and are guaranteed to keep growing. Now, I didn't want to make yet another video talking about AI. I wanted to be very actionable and also suitable for people with various backgrounds, whether it's tech, non- tech, business, science, etc. So, here's what I'm going to cover. I'll walk you through specific fields, not just roles, that will dominate the tech market in the next 15 years. For each, I will give proven stats and numbers that will explain why those are the jobs of the next 10 years. I will also discuss less techy and more techy options to show you the variety of roles that exist out there. And then we'll briefly talk about the salaries in different parts of the world. Starting with cyber security. Now, what is cyber security? Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It includes firewalls that block threats, systems that detect intrusions in real time, encryption that keeps sensitive data safe, and response teams that act fast when a breach happens. If it touches the internet, it's a target and someone needs to be there to secure it. Now, why is it the job of the future? Cyber threats increase in volume and complexity. Every year, attackers use more sophisticated tools to target everything from small businesses to infrastructure. And on top of that, AI is now being used by both attackers and defenders. Hackers use AI to automate fishing, crack passwords, and find vulnerabilities faster than ever. Security teams are using AI for real-time threat detection and incident response. Add the explosion of the remote work, cloud adoption, and IoT, and the need for security expert is only accelerating. Now, let's talk about the numbers. There's a massive market demand. AI and cyber security is projected to hit $12 billion by 2032. And this is the growth from 24.8 in 2024. Number two, also there is a severe talent gap. Cyber security roles remain to be unfilled globally. Exploding demand. Cyber security job growth is 267%. This is three times faster than any other job in tech. AI adoption is becoming mainstream. 44% of companies already use AI to detect cyber threats. Now, let's talk about the roles. We're starting with more techy cyber security engineer. They design secure systems and infrastructure. They manage firewalls and monitor network activity. Number two, testers and ethical hackers. They simulate cyber attacks to find vulnerabilities before real hackers do. Incident responders. They investigate security breaches. They contain threats and restore system during a cyber event. And security architects, they develop the overall security framework and strategy for the entire company. Now on to the less techy jobs. Sales engineer, they work with a sales team to explain security product to the client. This is a perfect mix of sales and cyber security job. You're not going to need to code every single day, but you need to understand the industry and the trends deeply to be able to provide the right solution to the customer. Compliance analysts, they ensure the company meets laws and regulations like GDPR or so to compliance. It's very heavy at documentation, audits and policy. Security awareness trainer or could also be a program manager on cyber security for a given organization. They build internal training programs to teach employees how to avoid fishing scams and breaches and all sorts of things. It's a great job if you're good at communication and training personnel. As for the salaries, moving on to cloud. What is cloud? Cloud computing means you don't store your information or data or run your own software on local machines anymore. It all lives in remote servers maintained by companies like AWS, Google Cloud or Azure. The cloud powers everything from Tik Tok to Zoom to fintech apps. It's not just storage. It's the infrastructure backbone of modern tech. Why is it a job of the future? Because companies are migrating to cloud to save money and scale faster. What used to take 6 months before in a data center now takes 6 minutes in AWS. But the complexity has also grown. Businesses are wasting millions on misconfigured or or reused services. Cloud now also powers AI training and deployment. So cloud talent is missionritical for security, scalability, and cost management. Now onto the numbers. Cloud market is booming. Just listen to this. It's projected to grow from $722 billion in 2025 to 2.7 trillion by 2034. There is a massive total addressable market. Cloud services expect to hit two trillion by 2032, growing at 22%. AI fueled growth. Generative AI could drive 200 billion to 300 billion in cloud spend by 2030. Cloud has also a very diverse revenue stream. You can go into software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, backend as a service. There is a large variety of cloud deployment models. Now talking about the jobs starting with the more techy ones. Cloud engineer they build and maintain the entire cloud infrastructure. DevOps engineer they automate deployment and integration pipelines. They manage CI/CD and do all sorts of optimization of cloud environment. Site reliability engineer. They ensure the cloud systems are reliable, available and scalable with minimum downtime. And lastly cloud security engineer. They design and enforce security for cloud-based systems and services. Onto the less techy job, cloud product manager. They define features for cloud services and make them usable for developers. It is still a pretty technical job for a product manager, but at least you don't have to code every single day. Cloud account executive or cloud sales engineer. They sell cloud infrastructure solutions to businesses and make very good commissions. Cloud billing analyst. They track and reduce cloud spending across departments. And this specific role is growing very fast due to rising cloud bills. as for the salaries. Moving on to AI ethics. What is AI ethics? AI ethics is the field making sure artificial intelligence systems act fairly, responsibly, and transparently. That means preventing algorithmic bias, ensuring people know how decisions are made, and protecting user rights. For example, if a system decides who gets a loan or who gets a job, someone has to make sure that it's being fair in those decisions. Why is it the job of the future? AI is rolling out faster than most people can understand it. It's used in hiring, credit score, law enforcement, healthcare, governments, all sorts of things. We have to put in regulations in place and governments are stepping in with new regulations. Public trust and AI is very fragile and companies cannot afford ethical failures. As regulations increase, companies are forming dedicated, responsible AI teams and they're hiring people who understand both ethics and policy. Speaking of the numbers, it is a very fast growing field. AI ethics is expected to grow by 28% by 2029. New roles are being formed. Titles such as AI ethics officer and human AI collaboration specialist and all sorts of AI ethics roles will be emerging as of 2025. hiring surge. AI job postings jumped 38% between 2020 and 2024 with rising demand for ethics oversight. And lastly, AI will add $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Ethical safeguards are now business critical. Lastly, there is a massive talent and skill gap. AI is creating 78 million jobs by 2030, but ethics talent is still in short supply. Now, on to the jobs. More techy ones. AI auditor. They evaluate models for bias, fairness, and compliance. A machine learning researcher with ethics focus. They build models with interpretability and safety as primary goals. AI governance engineer. They develop tools to monitor, document, and control AI systems at scale. Responsible AI engineers. They build pipelines that prioritize fairness, explanability, and traceability and AI outputs. Onto the less techy jobs. AI policy analyst tracks AI related legislation, advises teams on compliance and works with public agencies. Ethics program manager. They build internal programs to ensure AI systems follow ethical standards. AI PR and communications leads. They shape public messaging around AI and prepare for political and ethical scrutiny. This is the kind of a role where crisis management meets tech. This is a wonderful job for people who studied philosophy, psychology, public policy, political science, and liberal arts. If you're one of those people who did one of those degrees at school and you're not sure how to apply it and where you can work with that kind of degree, this is a fantastic opportunity for you. All you need to do is to upskill on how AI works. You don't necessarily need to code. You just need to have a very good understanding of how AI models get trained. As for the salaries onto the data science and robotics. Now what is this field about? Data science is using programming and statistics to extract insights from huge data sets, predicting customer churn, forecasting demand or flagging fraud. Robotics is designing and building machines that automate physical tasks. From warehouse bots to surgical robots, IoT is about connecting physical devices, toasters, speakers, fridges, cars to the internet so they can collect data and respond to their environment. Why are these the jobs of the future? We're drowning in data and companies are turning that data into value. Robotics is transforming labor intensive industries and IoT is creating smart devices, smarter homes, smarter cities, smarter factories. Demand for data scientists, robotics and IoT specialists will grow as automation, analytics and device networks scale. Now onto the numbers. There is a massive global demand. The robotics market is projected to reach 310 billion by 2030 while IoT is expected to hit 1.3 trillion. Data related roles are growing 36% yearover-year with over 11 million new data and AI jobs expected by 2035. Cross industry adoption. Robotics and IoT are scaling fast in logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, and smart cities. There is a significant skill shortage in fields such as robotics and IoT. Now, let's talk about the jobs. More techy ones, data scientists. They build predictive models and analytics pipelines. Machine learning engineers, they develop and apply machine learning models to solve big problems with a lot of data. Robotics engineers, they design and program physical machines and control systems. IoT architects, they build the infrastructure that connects and secures smart devices at scale. Now, onto the less techy jobs. Machine learning and AI product managers. Even though this is a less techy job, ML and AI PMs are still pretty technical as they still need to understand how machine learning models work, how the product development life cycle works within a ML product as well as to stay on top of trends. But an AI product manager is still a product manager except they build an AI powered products. AI sales specialists. They sell IoT, AI or robotics systems to manufacturers, logistics companies, hospitals, etc. This is a highly specialized sales role as you need to understand the needs of your customers and how they use AI. Ask for the salaries. And lastly, science plus tech such as biotech, climate tech, or health tech. What is it? This is the intersection of science and tech. Pretty much any scientific field, biology, chemistry, or physics, and technology. Examples of biotech companies go all the way from lab grown meat to gene editing. Climate tech builds tools that reduce carbon emission or adapt to environmental changes. Think carbon capture, energy storage or sustainable farming. Health tech includes digital diagnostics, AI assisted medicine, wearables and tellahalth. Why is it the job of the future? The global health, food systems, and climate tech are under strain. Tech is stepping in. Biotech is accelerating drug discovery and personalized medicine. Climate tech is racing against a warming planet. Health tech is expanding its efficiency and access in care. Onto the numbers, biotech alone is projected to hit $3.8 trillion by 2030. And climate tech startups raised $70 billion in VC funding in 2024. Global urgency. Climate change, aging population, and healthcare crisis are driving long-term investment in science-driven tech and AI integration. AI is accelerating drug discovery, diagnostics, energy modeling, and sustainability products. Let's talk about the jobs, more techy ones. Biioinformatics engineer. They use software to analyze genetic data and biological patterns. Climate data scientists, they model climate change scenarios and predict environmental impact. They design tech enabled tools to be used in diagnostics, monitoring or treatment. AI researcher in biotech or climate tech field. They apply machine learning to drug discovery, diagnostics, or patient outcome prediction. And now onto the less techy jobs. Specialized projects and operations managers. They keep scientific projects moving across research, engineering, and product. They coordinate biotech research studies. No lab work, just pure specialized project management. This is a wonderful choice for those of you who did their undergrad in sciences. And if you're not sure about what you want to do next in life or you're not sure that you want to pursue the academia, this job is perfect for those of you who did science degrees and perhaps you're not sure how to apply it if you don't want to go into academia. This is a perfect intersection of a science background plus technical skills. So all you need to do is to upskill on the technical side. So if you're one of those people who studied biology, physics, biochemistry, chemistry, any kind of life sciences or even mathematical sciences, but you don't want to go into pure data science or IoT, science plus tech is a wonderful choice because you work on very important problems that have worldwide impact. as for the salaries. So yeah, that's the list. Five areas, dozens of roles, techy and less techy, but all growing very fast. I hope this was helpful. Till next time. Bye.
