[Music] hi everybody I'm Nicola tangan and today I'm here with one of the most incredible Tech entrepreneurs Of All Times who started off in his freshman dorm room and built his company to one of the largest technology companies in the world now onethird of you will have a PC with his name on Michael D welcome thank you so much great to be with you normally Michael I would kind of start with the present but I think when it comes to you we have to go all the way back you know with the beginning you were very young and you bought an IBM computer and most most people would kind of start to do computer things but you took it apart instead what did you how did that happen what did what did you see inside that computer well you know you can't actually understand things unless you uh take them apart and know how they work and uh yeah I was very interested in electronics and kind of what was inside right and you know microprocessors memory chips and disc drives and power supplies and I kind of wanted to understand all this and so um I was curious and I was interested and one of the things that I found was that the the parts that were in this uh IBM PC you know was introduced in August of 1981 uh none of the parts were made by IBM and I was I was upgrading computers but you were what were you like 15 years old or something I was 16 years old 16 and how could you how did you buy it I mean did you get some money from your parents or you've made your own money or well I I I had when I was 12 I worked in a Chinese restaurant and uh had a bunch of different jobs I was like you know trading stocks and currency and when I was 14 and um I got a job at uh at a newspaper not delivering the newspapers selling newspapers and it just kind of had all the these little businesses right to to make money and it was fun right when you took it apart the the IBM what where were you were you in your room or living room or I was I was uh in my parents house you know where I lived in my room yeah so you you get a screwdriver and you just screw it apart sure yeah but what and what did you see inside what what was the how what did you learn when you open it well back then you could actually learn a lot because you didn't have these large chips that we have today that are an amalgamation of lots of small chips yeah and so you could literally uh get a book that would explain what each chip did and you could understand the circuits and as I said I was upgrading computers to make them do more right you know more memory more storage uh make them go faster right and so what I found in this IBM personal computer was that none of the parts were made by IBM M and then I sort of discovered that that the uh cost that they were uh you know the price they were charging for the computer was roughly six times the cost of the parts right and so it didn't really seem like it was fair to me that that it was that expensive IBM was the most valuable company in the world at that stage and you were 16y old they they were the most valuable company in the world and they were about 80% of the value of the sector you know called technology at the time so they were more dominant in their sector than any company maybe in any time in history I mean are there any companies today that are 80% of one sector of the S&P 500 no not even close so yeah they they were incredibly successful company what did you think at the time when you did you have any longer term plans so was this uh uh what do you think well when you're 16 years old you don't you don't have long-term plans right and I didn't I I I I was just having fun you know with computers and upgrading them and you know went through High School sort of doing that and I was programming computers and I was tutoring other kids on how to use computers and very interested in the idea that the personal computer was very empowering you know you could program it to do things and some of the parents of the kids I was tutoring said well you know I'd like a computer can can you help me get one like sure you I'll get you one I'll set it up for you and and I'll upgrade it for you and I'll you know uh do do all that and so it kind of became a little bit of a of a business while I was going to high school upgrading these computers and then um I went off to college I was uh Texas University of Texas I was a biology major I was supposed to be a doctor cuz your parents wanted you to study Premed my parents wanted me to to be a doctor my father's a doctor my brother's a doctor many of my cousins are doctors and so it was sort of the family business you know be a doctor and uh strong en encouragement from the parents so I'm not in in my parents house anymore I'm in the dorm room I've got a lot of time right you know University of Texas is a big school some of the classes are enormous if if you show up or you don't show up they don't really notice all the time right so you so you didn't always show up so I'm kind of doing this computer thing and and it's getting bigger and bigger and um my parents found out about it they got very upset they kind of made me stop I stopped for 10 days and uh and that's when I decided that actually this was something more so how did it scale how quickly do you did you scale it cuz growth rates in the beginning were tremendous right so um in early May of 1984 uh I the company was incorporated Del computer Corporation became a corporation uh and it was about a week or two before my final exams of my freshman year and so the first year we had $6 million in revenue and uh the second year was about uh 33 million and we we grew about 80% per year for the first eight years compounded and then for the six years after that we grew about 60% per year so you know if you put any number in there and you do that kind of compounding all of a sudden you've got tens of billions of dollars and and so that's what happened we we started um originally making upgrade kits for the IBM computers then designing our own computers and then uh expanding geographically we expanded from desktop computers into notebook computers then into servers and storage and services and here we are today 40 years how much how much did you work uh what does it take all the time I mean what else is there to do I mean if you're starting I mean uh yeah when when you when you start a company and you're 19 years old that's all you do is you work it's fun it's your life right yeah so so what is the entrepreneurial mindset what is it what is it that makes some people do these kind of things they're not many of them they're not many of you what do you think it is for me it was curiosity and and just interest in technology and uh the possibility that these machines you know could could enable people to do things and I was interested in in business and also I saw that that uh you know wow when when people get these machines you know they can do amazing things with them and the technology is improving so much and uh you know always looking to find a better way to do it you know can we can we beat the other guys right can we can we can we build a machine that is more has more performance than our competitors can we offer better value to our customers and you know grow grow the business and ultimately grow the impact of what we're able to do with with technology why do you think there are more entrepreneurs in America than elsewhere I think there's something in the in the culture that you know is is accepting uh risk even embracing risk in a good way right um that says well okay if you try something and it doesn't quite work and you fail it's okay try something else right and maybe that that is not as accepted everywhere I think there's you know a combination of factors right it's this risk acceptance It's Capital that will invest behind that there's a history of other entrepreneurs that you can look to that I look to and others look to and said well yeah they did it so maybe I could do it did you think it would risk at the time did you did you have a hair no no so if you have nothing nothing to lose right so uh it didn't see like a big risk I mean the risk for me was if it didn't work I go back to college so not that big of a risk now obviously you know as the business grow grows you're like wow now I've got you know hundreds of people working for me I'm responsible for them you know some of them have families and they have kids and so every night when you sort of put your head down on the pillow you're thinking I've got a big responsibility now I better not screw this up right all these people are depending on me but I think there's also a lot of opportunity that is unrealized because people aren't uh maybe as willing to take risks but I never really thought about it as oh I'm taking this massive risk you know you also uh changed the way uh people thought about supply chain how was your thinking differently than what was normally at the time so you know we um started the business as a a as a selling directly to the customer right and you know when I say that there's a there's generally a perception that the customer is an individual consumer it's true we sell to Consumers but actually the vast majority of our business has always been even from the beginning businesses uh governments institutions you know of all sizes large and small and so we we had this direct model that's how that's how the company started and uh if you contrast that to others where you had let's say retail stores and a and a series of people that were kind of in the middle between the manufacturer and the ultimate customer you have you know this kind of classical system of guessing what the demand is going to be and then putting inventory in these various locations and so uh something interesting occurred with with uh the the the personal computer and still very much the case in this industry and many others there's always new technology right and the cost of the material is generally coming down yeah and so if one company has you know let's say 90 days of collective inventory in its various stages going from the manufacturer to the ultimate customer and another company has let's say 5 days of inventory between the manufacturer and the customer and the material costs are coming down like this there's only one company that's going to win yeah right because it has a structural cost Advantage so that's what we had it also had an way better return on Capital right because we didn't have to have all the capital employed there so um how did we come about this well one way we came about it is we didn't have any capital right so so we had to invent something that was way more efficient and we had this direct to the customer model which also gave us incredible Fidelity in the signal of the demand yeah right because you know if somebody walks into a store well you have to have guessed before what it is they're going to buy but if somebody calls us on the phone or now you know we have the internet right they go online they buy something we know exactly what they want right because they're tell us yeah and that signal can go back to our supplier you know in a nanc and so you get this very efficient supply chain that you know is also very efficient in in in capital return you mentioned it was important to have a role models and of course uh some people have football players and baseball players as their role models I believe you more had people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and so on uh how important is that yeah well and and you met Steve Jobs when you were very young I did and and you know you had you had uh you know people like Fred Smith who started FedEx and Charles Schwab and others you know you could see entrepreneurs that were out there you know starting businesses you like that's pretty cool right what what what what they're doing and um you know it it was never like I want to be exactly like that it's like well what can I learn from that they did something really cool and interesting and yeah I think it's I think it's important to have those examp it's interesting because um when I prepared for this I spoke to a lot of people who know you and and they all say you know what Michael Dell he's like a he's like a real businessman he loves business I mean there are few like dieh hard businessmen and if it hadn't been computers it would have been something else just why do you love business I think I think it's fun be because you know uh it's it's an interesting puzzle right to to solve right it's like why do certain businesses grow and succeed why do other fail you know how do you position how do you create the right products how do you align the the people and the teams you know to to to drive success and ultimately progress in the world my view is generally not from the government it's from it's from the private sector it's from individuals and businesses that are propelling uh Innovations and driving driving forward and so you know to be a to be a part of that in the technology sector in the most exciting time in the world I don't know anything that would be more fun and interesting than that just off the year 2000 you became the biggest brand in the world did you celebrate that I mean are you are you a believer in celebration you know we kind of have this uh phrase you know celebrate for a nanc so we not we do some celebrations but not too big into that we we mostly think about where are we going in the future how do we continue to grow and expand and provide more to our customers and you know we're in a business where it's always changing there's always something new coming what's been the biggest surprise for you in terms of Technology development so when you go back what has been like wow this is I never expected this to happen it kind of happens in a bit a slow motion so it's not all that surprising um I think certainly you know in the last two or three years the tremendous uh progress in in Ai and particularly large language models and the speed at which that's happened and how it's been diffused you know into open source and you know is I think really a revolution in a lot of areas I was surprised by it um in in in the instant that that it started to to happen as I think a lot of people were what is your take on the current state of AI development I think we're in the the the first 10% of the scurve you know and uh most of the uh world has not really figured out how to use all these tools although we have access you know very broadly the tools that we have are pretty amazing but they're the worst they'll ever be right they're going to get way way better in 5 years and most of the data that exists in the world hasn't even been touched as it relates to uh these kinds of tools and and and and there will also be compounding improvements that layer on top of the existing improvements and yeah I think it's a it's a it's a revolution in terms of the productivity and efficiency that it unlocks inside existing businesses more than that I think it's an opportunity for growth and for reimagining how a lot of things are done in the world that ultimately will uh Propel you know Humanity forward so when you look at because you have insights into a lot of the Enterprises and what what are the most exciting uh changes and developments you're seeing there I think we're I think we're still very much at the beginning of this and what's happening is businesses Enterprises are realizing that they can fundamentally rethink a number of their processes and ultimately become much better at the things that are important to them and uh automate a lot of things that are wrote or not as interesting you know for for humans to do and you know we had this sort of uh shumer creative Destruction for a long time right where some new technology or model comes along and and it you know replaces old ones this is just that but turbocharged to an extreme but is it slower than you had expected is the uptake from normal companies slower it doesn't feel very slow to to from from where I see it because people people are slow when it comes to changing the way they work right there there's definitely there's definitely a cultural element there right you you have to you have to want to change and you have to have a culture that Embraces change and that's not always the case in all organizations but I think what's generally happening is you know you have again a kind of s-curve adoption where you have some early leaders in just about every industry that kind of say wow you know we can have 10 or 20% productivity Improvement not it's not very hard to get that and there have been sightings of 30% or 40% we better go do that right and if one firm does that and another firm in the same industry hears about that like well maybe we better do that too if they don't you'll see firms more quickly separating themselves succeeding faster or failing faster which has generally been a trend for a long time right the the pace of business cycle been been speeding up and so uh I think we're I think we're starting to see that and there there are tons of use cases that are obvious from software development you know enhancing the the the productivity of software developers making the code actually better Sam Sam Oldman told us that we should improve over productivity by 20% so that's the target we have well there you go I and I think that is a completely reasonable Target that's not a crazy Target at all given the tools that are out there now I think it's it's easier for larger firms than smaller firms because there are way more people involved in the processes that go on inside larger firms yeah right but they also have you know cultural inertia and you know things that can get in the way but you know this is this is why leaders differentiate they're able to make changes that Propel organizations forward yeah talking about tools who do you think will um will win the hardware race the chip race clearly we we have one company you know Nvidia that has uh got an incredible early lead right and and they're they're they're they're in a great position uh lots of companies have entered the space I don't think of it as as uh as you know one company wins everything so you know first of all AI itself will occur anywhere where there is data right so on your PC on your phone in your car every thing in the world is becoming more intelligent and more connected you know and is generating data and so the AI is going to go to where the where the data is and you know some of it will occur in big training you know data centers like the kind we're building and and uh you know talking about but most of it will actually occur in the real physical world so I think there will be many companies that that succeed in in that space certainly we have been you know probably the leading company in the world now building these large AI uh server farms for uh training and inference to to fuel these AI engines some people think that uh eventually uh compute will be free you think computer will be free eventually sure you can have a free computer just doesn't do very much right if you want the latest one that cost a little more than free right um but I mean the cost you know of of a given unit of computing certainly is ASM totically approaching zero for sure it's just that what you want to do that's interesting and valuable uses more computing power moving into uh consumer PCS so um a third of your income is from commercial PC um like the one I have on at my desk what are the important Innovations taking place here now they look a bit like they don't change that much right I mean they look a bit like the one I had last year and last year yeah this is kind of the deceptive thing right because if I said here's a PC right well you could have a PC from 40 years ago or 30 years ago you know 10 years ago still a PC right well actually what the PC does is very very different than it used to do and so we keep asking to do more and more things right now the big thing that's that's you know going in the PC is AI and you know we used to have the the CPU right then we had the GPU now we have something called the npu a neural processing unit and it is a part of the processor that speeds up the AI activities that occur on the PC to an incredible degree and pretty much all the soft software that you're using is being Rewritten so that anytime there's a prompt uh or some you know user interaction that is that experience is enhanced and made better using Ai and most of that AI maybe 85 90% of it will run locally on your PC and so we talk about the AI PC and there are 1.5 billion PCS in the world rough and about 750 million of them are more than four years old obviously they're not going to be able to do this even the ones from last year don't really do it so all the new ones have these npu the this this ability to enhance AI software on them and that's probably the biggest thing that's going on in addition to you know longer battery life we have you know more than 24hour battery life you know super super bright dis super thin super light very secure you know all the things that you'd want in a in a in a new machine to replace the one that's that's several years old there's so we will continue to buy new ones basically yeah I mean if you want to be in the in the future right you we sell a product in in in the PC which is actually not our main business by by profits right uh that would be the cloud and the data center um we sell a product that is a fine life Appliance okay what that means is that when we create a new one that is significantly better than the old one you'll want to replace it uh now if we don't create one that's that much better then you won't want to replace it so that's our job is to make it so compelling that you don't want your old one anymore now moving on to um uh uh to the company so in you were listed on a so exchange for 25 years and then in 2013 you took Del private to get off the stock exchange correct why why did you do that so um you know around 2010 we started uh evolving the company in uh into new areas and we were making Acquisitions and we were building uh you know cloud data center networking storage capability and kind of the more we did that the less the market liked it at the same time something else was going on you had the the smartphone and the tablet right were sort of On The Rise and so a lot of people looked at the smartphone and the tablet they said well that that's the new thing we don't need the PC anymore because we have we have these other things and Dell even though it has all these other businesses it's kind of a PC company so the PC's dead so therefore Dell's dead right so so the stock kept going down we're buying back the stock at one point the stock is like really low and I'm thinking this is kind of crazy I this company's generating lots of free cash flow billions of dollars of free cash flow every year it had generated $150 billion dollar of cash flow in in its lifetime let's just do a huge buyback let's buy back all the shares okay and and and we'll accelerate the transformation of the company uh faster because we won't be thinking about the quarterly you know uh uh you know gyration we'll be thinking more about the fiveyear and the 10year outcome so that's what we did but you also bought so when it was Private you also bought EMC very big deal yeah we so so when we when we when we took SP like 67 billion right so biggest technology acquisition correct the world had ever seen right so when when when we took Del private it was the largest take private ever in technology yeah and then a private company uh bought a$ 67 billion public company and took it private too which was kind of fun and um that significantly accelerated our transformation now we kind of became uh like a public company then because we had a tracking stock associated with emc's ownership in VMware and uh and then ultimately we we became a fully public company again at the end of 2018 so it's the most profitable private deal ever I think that's what I'm told it it's worked it's worked out well could have been a lot worse but it worked out well so you characterize it as as fun still did you have any fear uh when you were doing that or not really a little bit a little bit you know there there were certainly uh periods where there was uncertainty right like okay how's all this going to work right you know we're uh this is a fairly big company we're we're buying and combining with our company and and you had some activist investors who didn't make life easier for you we did we did yeah um so there was there was there was definitely there were definitely some moments but we worked through through all that had a lot of great people helping me and you know we we had a we had a theory about how it would work and uh it actually turned out better than we thought in in almost all areas not not everyone and we were able to create you know a a much broader set of capabilities for customers that customers thought you know was very attractive what was the one thing that went particularly much better than you had expected well we we we believe that if we went to our large Enterprise customers and we said well you know in the past you you would buy the servers from Dell and you would buy the storage from EMC and you would buy you know some software here and You' put all this stuff together and that if we said well hey you know we're number one in all these areas including commercial PCS would you rather have fewer suppliers than more that they would like that and we didn't really need heroic assumptions uh for for the the you know the combination with EMC to work and so we didn't really have heroic assumptions but it turned out that it worked even better than we thought and so there was you know $20 billion in organic Revenue growth uh in the first several years and uh customers really liked what we were doing so we you know cranked up the Innovation engine we kept applying you know uh new capabilities and uh customers liked it well congratulations it's incredible what are the positiv was a lot of fun still is yeah I know I can see that what um what are the positives and negatives of being a private being a public company are you having a stock market listing you know I think I think you you could do it either way uh honestly you know back in 2012 2013 we had kind of gotten ourselves into a into a bad situation really where we were overly short-term focused and so you know going private was a was a great reset for us and it allowed us to kind of reignite the entrepreneurial culture and reset the time Horizon to a longer one and we've been able to maintain that you know even as we've come public again um and so yeah I mean everybody understands the the kind of pluses and minuses um but you know for us th those were those were the main things and and you know how do you maintain a longer term orientation you know even as you're a public company and you you you mentioned resetting Cora culture what is the Cora culture at Dell how would you describe it it's winning it's it's it's it's delivering value for our customers it is understanding their requirements and solving them it is uh a results orientation um it is uh play nice but win yeah so kind of brings brings us to the book you you wrote there yes play nice but win what what does it mean it means that you know we we can be fair and ethical and honest in our approach and also win um and um you know it's just it's something I learned from from my parents from my mother specifically um that she taught me and my my two brothers when we were when we were little kids and kind of stuck with me and uh it's kind of uh in the book I talk a lot more about the less it's a great book I I love the book thank you I had a lot of fun writing the book too I did that during during Co but what's the key to winning I mean how do you win in this industry it's a complicated uh mixture of things right it's part strategy it's part uh engaging and understanding you know new customer requirements I mean at one level what we do is we solve problems that customers have that are valuable and important to them now and in the future and if we do that successfully they give us more business and we grow and we Thrive as a as a business and if we don't we you know we're gone right just the way it works and so our job is to listen with big ears and understand the customer requirements what are those challenges are uh now there's more to it than that right we have to also understand and what are the molecular ingredients of technology that are coming around the corner uh and all the Innovations in science that are going to enable uh the the new capabilities that that can be built in software hardware and everything else and so how do you have the biggest impact on the company now I spend my time on on strategy on uh products on customers on you know de developing uh our our team and and our leaders um you know and and certainly a big part of strategy is where are we going to focus our our resources and uh what is our path to continuing to win and create value when you speak to other CEOs do you see a difference between the founders the people who have founded and St CEOs and other CEOs not always um but certainly you know it is personal right when you when you found when you found a company and you it's been your life's work right and you you've been doing doing it uh for all of your adult conscious life uh yeah I think there's something different there but but I I've seen plenty of non-founders who who are also incredibly passionate about what they're doing uh so I don't think there's a hard and fast rule about that do people dare to disagree with you well if they don't disagree with me then I get very worried right and so you know we we we we we try to create an environment that we make sure uh that we have active debate and discussion first of all I don't try to make all the decisions myself that would be disastrous would slow the company down but to your point you need you need a a team that's able to have a a rigorous debate and you know I mean I'm often very uh unsure about a lot of things right because things are moving around all the time things are changing and so you know we we often have this notion of uh okay we've got an idea and a belief but they could change right new information new data new facts uh something different happened we change our mind so uh this friend of mine he went to a conference at a hotel in uh in Texas and there was his notepad on the table and you there's a quote from you at the bottom of the notepad and it says try never to be the smartest person in the room and if you are I suggest you invite smarter people or find a different room yeah I mean you you you want to surround yourself with really smart people that that can you know help Propel whatever it is you're doing forward and uh I I believe that and what is it that keep you hungry now I mean you are you you have this incredbly successful company you're one of the richest people in the world just what makes you excited you know uh we just we you know last week was the superc Computing 24 show right we showed off this rack where we can put 50 trillion transistors in one rack okay and if you if you step back and you think about that amount of computing power and what can be done in uh drug Discovery as it relates to cancer or in solving all the unsolved problems in the world uh that is what excites me what excites me is the impact that technology has on the world in a in a very positive way and that's what we do any particular areas you excited about I mean I know your philanthropy for instance goes into health education yeah definitely I definitely I think health is is an area where technology has yet to make the impact that it could and we're starting to see some signs that you know it it can have an enormous impact in in the next decade or so and uh you know that's incredibly exciting I think education you know this idea of an infinitely patient tutor that can help you know a student learn exactly the thing that they need to learn to to advance and ultimately you know technology has always been about enabling human potential and the last you know uh 40 years have been incredibly exciting but I think it's just a pregame show I think we're we're just getting to the the more interesting part where technology is is going to have a much bigger role in progressing the world forward and so you know we're not doing everything there's a lot of we have to work with a lot of other companies to make all this happen but to be a part of that is incredibly exciting fascinating interesting and fun at the same time as you have done uh built the technology company you also have built MSD Capital which is well which was in a way a family office but has become much bigger right um and one of the most successful investment boutiques on Wall Street you hire Greg lmow from Goldman is a an extremely accomplished investment bankers you merged it with uh BDT and other a very strong firm how do you see this going forward MSD BDT right so you know it really started out as investing you know for our foundation and for our family and then you know I had a bunch of friends that said well you know hey looks like you're uh doing this pretty well can we come and take a look sure yeah come and take a look and then and they said we want to build the same thing you know okay fine great go build the same thing and uh they came back a couple years later and said well we we tried it's it's hard uh can we invest with you said no no we don't want to do that uh they came back a you know few times and a couple years later we said okay fine so so we we sort of set up a firm to help other Founders usually and some some families and uh and then merging with BDT now we have something much greater which essentially provides you know aligned advice and aligned capital and uh aligned investment Solutions uh not just for our family but for lots of families and and um as I said I love business I love investing it's all very interesting and fun what what is your role in this I am mostly still running Delta Technologies as the chairman CEO uh but I'm you know chairman of The Advisory Board of the firm and I help the firm you know in areas where I you know maybe know a little bit more than than some other areas and you know Greg and Byron Trot are doing a great job leading the firm they don't really need my help that much but you know I'll pitch in from time to time when I when I can help you mentioned uh fun uh a few times and clearly you are more fun than most cosos that's uh that's a very that's very clear what what place does humor play in your company I think Humber is is very important yeah I mean if you can't laugh joke around uh play tricks on people you know you're doing it wrong right so you you have you have to be able to laugh at yourself and you know and uh and humor is incredibly important do you look for it when you hire do you hire fun people are people in in Dell more fun than than anywhere else I don't know about that um um me personally I have not spent a lot of time in recent years um hiring from the outside most of the the work that I've done in the company has been developing and training the next generation of leaders inside the company yeah I'm spending time developing uh our team figuring out you know who who who who speaks up right who has a different perspective who can see around corners and who has new interesting ideas and who's not afraid to challenge the way we did it before uh those are the people that I want to have more responsibility how' you relax uh well I learned a long time ago that there's a diminishing return to the number of hours worked in any given day right and if you're going to do something for a long time you better find the right sort of you know balance it's maybe not exactly the right word
