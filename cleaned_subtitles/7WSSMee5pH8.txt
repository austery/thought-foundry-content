- A cognitive script is an
internalized behavioral pattern
that tells us how we're supposed
or at least how we think
we're supposed to act
in certain situations.
They can be very helpful for
routine tasks and decisions
in everyday life.
Cognitive scripts were first discovered
in a seminal 1979 study, where researchers
found that people are
following very similar scripts
in similar situations,
such as going to the doctor
or going to the restaurant.
And since then, they have
found those cognitive scripts
in all areas of your life.
For routine everyday decisions,
cognitive scripts are actually
very practical and useful.
For example, you know that
when you're going to go
to the doctor, you're supposed
to wait in the waiting room
and then someone is
going to call your name.
And then, you're going to
go into doctor's office
and this is where you're
going to start telling them
about whatever the issue is, right?
And you know in which
order you're supposed to do
all of those different actions.
Great, useful, and it's
a pretty good thing
that you don't have to overthink it
every time you go to the doctor.
The problem with cognitive
scripts is when we use them
to make more important
decisions in our lives,
in our careers, in our relationships,
instead of asking ourselves,
is that really what I want
to do, is that my decision,
we let our choices being
driven by those stories
that we have internalized by those scripts
that tell us how we're supposed to behave
in a certain situation.
(gentle music)
One of these scripts is the Sequel Script.
That's the script where we
feel like we've always behaved
in a certain way, so we're
going to keep on behaving
in the same way.
We feel like the narrative
needs to make sense.
This is the script that
makes people choose careers
that are aligned with whatever
they studied at university.
That is the script that
makes people keep on dating
the same kind of people
they've been dating before.
And this is in general the
script that makes us repeat
the exact same behaviors and patterns
that we've had in the past.
In relationships in particular,
what's very interesting
is that we want the Sequel to connect
to whatever the previous experience was.
So, that might mean dating
the exact same type of person
or choosing the next person in response
to whoever we were dating before.
And they might look like
the complete opposite,
but the truth is we still pick this person
based on the sense of continuity
with whatever the previous
experience was before.
With the Sequel Script,
it's quite obvious why it
limits the possibilities
that we might explore in life,
because we feel like whatever decision
we're making next needs to make sense
in relation to the decisions
we made in the past.
We ignore a lot
of more left field,
unexpected type of decisions
that might be opportunities for growth,
and exploration, and self discovery.
Another cognitive script
that rules our life
is the Crowdpleaser Script.
This is the script where we make decisions
based on whatever is going to please
people around us the most.
Quite often, those are the
people are our parents.
We might make decisions based on whatever
is going to make them feel like
you're safe and successful.
But the audience for
the Crowdpleaser Script
can also be your friends,
can be your partner,
can be your colleagues.
And what you don't realize
when you follow the Crowdpleaser Script
is that you're not making decisions
based on what you want and
what would make you happy,
but based on what will make
others around you happy.
Finally, there's the Epic Script,
and this one is very insidious
because it's actually
celebrated in our society.
It's the script that says
that whatever you do,
it needs to be big, it
needs to be very ambitious,
it needs to be impactful.
Anything less than that is failure.
The Epic Script is an extreme version
of the idea of following your dreams.
And because of that, it has
created a form of stigma
around having a small, simple life.
A life that is focused on just
being happy in the moment,
being present, being connected,
and exploring your curiosity.
Because if you don't have those
external signs of success,
if you're not following
your grant passion,
then are you really
living a meaningful life?
This is the anxiety inducing question
that is created by the Epic Script.
When you think about it,
this is a very myopic
definition of success
where we try to put all of
our eggs in the same basket.
We choose this one thing and we say,
"If I succeed to this, then
I'm successful in life."
The problem with this is that if we fail
at this particular project,
this particular goal,
we feel like we have
failed at life entirely.
And the other problem with
putting all of our eggs
in the same basket is that
then sometimes the basket
just becomes too heavy and
we drop it all together.
Our modern hyperconnected online world
has made the Epic Script,
unfortunately, very,
very popular with people.
We have become overly obsessed
with finding our purpose.
Mentions in books of the
phrase, "find your purpose,"
have surged 700% in the
past two decades only.
We see all of those stories
of success of people
who have found their passion
and who are very happy
as a result of this.
We see the entrepreneur
that followed their passion
and was very successful,
but we don't see all of
the thousands of other ones
that have tried the exact
same thing and failed.
This is called survivorship bias,
and it's very unfortunate how nowadays
we are basing all of our
decisions and even our self-worth
based on that incomplete information.
Once you have identified
the cognitive scripts
that rule your life, you can
actually break free from them,
and it really starts by seeing them
as stories we tell ourselves
rather than truth that we
need to follow blindly.
A really good way to do
this is to stop for a second
every time you hear yourself
saying, "I should do this."
This word should is actually
a really good signal
that there might be a
cognitive script at play
somewhere here.
And once you've identified
the places in your life
and the situations in your
life where you are using
that word, should, you can then
decide to replace that word
with another word, might.
What might I want to do
instead of what should I do.
What might I want to explore?
What might I want to experiment with?
If you wanna start writing
your own scripts in life,
there are three questions
that you can ask yourself
while designing your next experiment.
The first one is am I following my past
or discovering my path?
The second one is am I following the crowd
or am I discovering my tribe?
And then finally, am
I following my passion
or am I discovering my curiosity?
Those three questions together
allow you to embrace the
liminal space we're all in,
to make friends with uncertainty,
to start experimenting more,
and very importantly, to deal
with those three powerful
cognitive scripts
that underlie a lot of our decisions
on an unconscious level.
