>> Hello and welcome to another episode of the All Thoughts Podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway
>> and I'm Joe Weisenthal.
>> Joe,
>> yes.
>> Have you ever wanted to tour a data center?
>> Uh, I'd love to. Um,
>> part of me thinks it would be really boring, like if you actually went inside, cuz it would just be a bunch of the same cables like over and over and over again, but part of me thinks just seeing the scale of it would be amazing. You know what I would do if I tooured a data center is I would look at those cables and every nut and bolt and vac and um and heating thing and get every brand name I could on any little piece of equipment in the entire thing and then see are there any of these that are AI plays that the market doesn't real you know any random screwdriver that's being used in this operation what is the name is it publicly traded
>> so literally picks and shovels
>> yeah just lit exactly oh here is here there's a company that makes the um you know the doors stop is are they an AI play because they're going to need a lot of doors stops for all these doors. That's what I would do.
>> Okay. So, uh I guess the the Joe Hypers scale data center ETF um coming to a market near you eventually. That would be a good idea.
>> That's a great idea.
>> Well, today we're going to talk about uh some of these data centers. Yeah. with someone who has actually gone on a field trip and looked at them and then we're going to talk about broader AI because of course
>> with markets still you know basically at records there's a lot of concern that valuations are getting out of hand we've had these financing deals which just do my head in in terms of like trying to track who's lending to who and who's buying from who and all of that so we should talk about it
>> totally because I mean two things which is one we know how important AI is to the stock market two, you know, as there's all these sort of complicated financing deals and the numbers change by the day. So just today we got news that in the latest Open AI is allowing some of its employees to sell shares at a half a trillion dollar valuation. It just seems like it's constant fund raise, constant numbers that go higher and higher and higher every day. Various estimates for how much capital expenditure is going to happen in this cycle seem to go up. I feel like what we really need to do is have one of these conversations every month and just get for real like we need to keep uh like it changes so fast and the stakes seem so high.
>> Yeah, you definitely need frequent updates. The other thing of course hovering in the background is the importance of the AI buildout to the overall economy, right? And this is the question like is the I think Deutsche Bank actually put out a note on this. Is the entire US economy being propped up by AI right now? Maybe that's not a problem if you know if the AI stuff actually gets built and materializes into real money. But you can imagine if it is a bubble then that would be bad.
>> The way I see it is there's essentially two ways this is going to end up. One is it turns out it was a bubble we have a massive recession and we all lose our jobs. And the other possibility is that AI is not a bubble. We have AGI and we all lose our jobs. And so I'm curious which of the two paths is going to happen. Well, I got to say there are some alternate possibilities. Did you see the uh Dallas Fed chart?
>> Uh I haven't seen that one.
>> So, it showed GDP per capita and one line was like for AGI and it just goes straight up.
>> Straight up. It just literally vertical.
>> Yeah. But then the other line is what if the robots take over the world and kill everyone and that line went straight down.
>> So, yeah. So,
>> okay. Okay.
>> Lots of good outcomes here.
>> Yes. All right. Uh so we have the perfect guest, someone we've spoken to before, uh who writes absolutely phenomenal research about AI and actually digs into literally the nuts and bolts of everything. We're going to be speaking with James Van Gilan. He is the author of the Catrini newsletter. James, thanks for coming back on.
>> Thanks for having me. I feel like uh the last time we were here, we were also discussing whether AI is a bubble or not, and now we get to do it again.
>> One day, one day it'll be right. Right. Analysts going on field trips is one of my favorite genres of research. Explain to us how you managed to do this.
>> So drones have become very commoditized. The likelihood of anything in the world being more than a 10 mile radius from someone with a drone is extremely low.
>> And we kind of use that to our advantage because we've been sitting in front of a screen watching green numbers go up and up and up. And it's not my fault that they named it Stargate. It kind of lends itself to not taking it as serious as as one otherwise might.
>> And someone I read a tweet that said, "Well, where's the proof?
>> There probably should be proof, right?" So, we looked at some satellite images and we went, "Okay, a year ago this was dirt and now there's this thing and it's the size of lower Manhattan."
>> Wow.
>> So,
>> it's in Texas, right?
>> It's in Abalene, Texas. And and the the I mean, this is actually one of the smaller ones. I mean, if you look at Louisiana Meta's Hyperion, it would start, the footprint would start at the top of Central Park and it would go down to Soho.
>> Wow.
>> So,
>> that's why they call it hypers scale.
>> So, just to be clear with Stargate, this is like the thing that like Trump and Oracle and probably SoftBank is in the middle. Like, what is this complex? Who's behind it? This thing that you went and uh toured and got some drone footage of. So it's essentially a mix of um you know Oracle, OpenAI, there's some involvement from Nvidia, there's Saudi interest with MGX, there is some financing involved and it is just one of uh currently five uh data centers that are planned with a half a trillion dollars of investment. That's why we went and looked at it because when you really think about it, this represents probably the largest infrastructure buildout and effort since World War II.
>> Where are they getting the energy from?
>> So, that's the that's the best part. That was the first thing we saw in the drone is you fly over it
>> and they just built their own natural gas plant
>> and going like Joe, great idea. just going and looking at all the but you got to look at the big stuff too, right? And and without uh
>> I mean without power these are just kind of you know hunks of metal. So you have outside of Stargate Avalene 10 natural gas turbines and the interesting thing is these aren't like the really good natural gas turbines because if you wanted so natural gas turbines follow along simple cycle combined cycle these are simple cycle they're each 35 megawatt which is very much on the lower end uh half of them are from G Vernova half of them are from Caterpillar a company that Caterpillar owns called solar turbines and the reason why they're not you would think oh you're spending half a trillion dollars on these things, you could probably get the best thing ever, but that'll take you seven years.
>> Oh, right. Because there's a there's a natural gas turbine Yeah. shortage. By the way, there's a headline speak. So, there's a headline, an article on the Bloomberg today by Matthew Griffin. The hunt for winners in the artificial intelligence gold rush has landed on an unlikely target. Oldline industrial equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. So, you got to look at every one of these brands that's uh supplying it. And Caterpillar is up a lot or it's up today and the stock is uh done very well. So, okay, Caterpillar, who else? What are some of the What else do you see besides these big turbines when you go out and tour this facility?
>> So,
>> oh, this stock is a rocket. So, that's at 40.
>> You see any people like security guards?
>> So many people,
>> huh?
>> And I mean, it's there.
>> I don't know. you've seen like Silicon Valley and there's that scene where there's like one guy in the data center and he's like, "Yeah, you know, night and day don't really matter much down here and it's just one guy running." But
>> in the buildout, I mean, there are every single HVAC technician or guy that knows how to lay fiber or guy that knows electrical or plumbing. Uh
>> within a 100 mile radius of Abene, those are they're all there, right? There's 7,000 people working on building this and this is just one site. And uh yeah,
>> so people have been talking about the picks and shovels fa phase of AI investment for a while now, but it seems like stuff is still getting built and it has further to run. my kind of favorite we can you know and I'm sure we will discuss whether this is a bubble or not but at the end of the day the money is getting spent and my favorite kind of setup in the market is you have something that has a multiple that reflects kind of a wrong reality or doesn't really fully integrate a secular theme and then you have a cycle that's really bad. So whether it's kind of the robotic supply chain goes throughout the automotive cycle and if you guys are aware that's been a nightmare. Uh and then you have some of these a lot of these companies took really significant draw downs when Trump got elected
>> because uh the
>> this isn't really tech capex. It's much more similar to like LG terminal capex
>> that kind of entails the same companies that were benefiting from the IRA. Oh, interesting.
>> So, everyone sold them and now it turns out it's kind of like the horseshoe theory, right? You can
>> No, that's super interesting. Like, it's just these sort of like oldline industrials and they did very well under the Obama administration because of all the factories and all that stuff that we talked about and then it's like, okay, we're pulling the plug on this, but now there's just this title wave of money. By the way, Caterpillar was a $334 stock on April 2nd, right before Liberation Day, which is sort of where we should benchmark things. now 486 at an all-time high. What are some of the other companies you see out there? No, for real, like
>> preferably the ones that haven't gone up yet, right?
>> Yeah. Well, but seriously, like who else is uh who else is getting a piece of this action?
>> So, uh something that I want to make sure I mention just to frame this whole thing, uh if you look at the building site plans, they have the names of all the data halls and they are literally each called Ludicrous Building. So, it's Ludicrous Building One, Ludicrous Building Two. Wait, is it Ludicrous with a K?
>> No.
>> Oh, that would be great.
>> I mean, Ludicrous spelled correctly is also fantastic, but
>> uh the compet I mean really I would encourage anyone to go and look at this video because the the it's it's just a there is such a disconnect between looking at green numbers going up like like caterpillar going you okay cool. Yeah. And then you see it and it is mind-blowing. I mean they have rows of uh dry and adiatic coolers that are you know hundreds and hundreds for the liquid cooling loops
>> and then you have uh the kind of uh all the HVAC the power generation transmission.
>> We compiled a list of basically 200 companies 50 of which were high confidence in in kind of seeing as part of this buildout. And the interesting thing is you have these multinational OEMs. The scale of this project is so large that you can call one of them and say okay we want to go with uh you know uh Mitsubishi heavy or we want to use uh eaten for for this thing and they will say yeah okay well we can do 60% of it.
>> I mean it it the biggest companies in the world are are yeah
>> they're just fighting they don't have to fight with each other because the pie is so big. how scarce, you know, there's all this um around the country there's been all this tension like is there going to be enough energy for data centers? What about the water? What about the politics? People we see these uh town halls where the locals still want a data center. How scarce are locations like Abolene? I mean, there's a lot of empty space in Texas. Could you see are there more Stargates or more Abalines out there waiting where the companies can just say, you know what, we're just going to build our own infrastructure. we're going to build our own natural gas plant and we're just going to do it in the desert in Texas where we don't have to worry about nimbies or local politics or anything. Is that the future for a lot of this stuff?
>> Yeah, there's already another uh facility that's planned in Shackleford, Texas, which is not too far from Abalene. Abalene is already planning on expanding by another 600 megawatts. I mean, that's how we're measuring data centers now is is just in megawatts and gigawatts. Uh in Louisiana, that's where Meta is building Hyperion. you have uh some uh unidentified or unannounced Midwest facility that'll probably be in Ohio. Uh basically, yeah, anywhere that you can get the gas, anywhere you can get the power, anywhere that there's the land. Uh there was one planned in Indianapolis. And it's interesting you bring up water cuz we wrote about water a little while ago as well, and we were basing our projections off of what the water consumption of like existing data centers were. The advancements in liquid cooling have changed that a lot. So there was a huge kind of uproar about well this data center is going to use so much water and if you look at it this was in Indianapolis and if you look at it it's about the same amount of water as a thousand households because it's all closed loop liquid cooling now the water just gets recycled and and filtered back. So, it's really just something where the constraint is still power and getting these kind of turbines and it's and and it's going to increasingly become a thing where it's behind the meter power generation.
>> They're just going to build their own power plants. They're not going to rely on the grid. You guys remember what happened in Texas in 21 with Erica? Yeah. They you cannot underwrite that as a data center.
>> Like uh you you just can't be offline. So that's kind of where we're headed is this power and energy kind of bottleneck is the bottleneck. The mo one of the more interesting things we ran across is you look at XAI's data center and we went through a lot of the filings of all these different data centers. are permitted for 15 35 megawatt turbines
>> and there's thermal imaging of the site that shows they're using 35
>> H gnova another one that was a 330
>> you're just typing tickers.
>> Yeah, that was a $330 stock on April 2nd. That's a $69 stock. So check out Seaman's Energy.
>> Thank you, Joe. Oh, he's he's doing it.
>> You could you could keep going.
>> All right. Um I have kind of this isn't an essential question, but
>> Okay, wait. I got it. Hey, Sean. I knew this was going to happen. I know. Seaman's Energy was a $56 stock on April 2nd. That's 108. That's a straight lineup. Okay.
>> Okay. Clearly, someone's making money.
>> Yeah. [Music] Like how big are the walls of these things? And what does security actually look like? Because, you know, we talk about people being upset about higher energy prices. I understand that maybe some of the some of them are building out their own energy capacity, but you know, in a populist mindset, people might still be upset at AI. Still upset that AI is going to take jobs and things like that. They could become targets, right?
>> Yeah, absolutely. I I I mean, apparently security isn't tight enough to shoot down a drone yet.
>> Oh, of course. Yeah. But when you talk about the walls, like the interesting thing is everything in this data center has you can't just build it like a house.
>> Everything needs to have the right, you know, anti-corrosion, uh, insulation. You can't just be losing heat. You're already spending so much money on cooling. So everything in the building envelope is also kind of the most expensive thing it could be.
>> And I assume it's like a sealed envelope, I guess.
>> Yeah, exactly. and and uh the the opportunity of just how how big is this going to be if you actually believe the the the people that are building this uh and this is kind of an interesting dynamic of the hyperscalers are in somewhat of a prisoner's dilemma. We can't speak to whether they actually uh believe or not, but the party line is we're building machine God.
>> And if we're building machine God, then that's kind of a religious zealatry. So uh 3 years ago most of these hyperscalers were making net zero by 2030. Uh that is not happening. There's no way that's happening. Uh maybe they buy carbon off it but that's not happening because if you need to do it now you're using natural gas.
>> And then you say well once we create machine God machine God will fix it
>> right
>> and you can justify a lot of stuff.
>> Wait. Okay. So, let's talk about is AI in a bubble? Cuz when when we're conversing about buildings that are literally called Ludicrous and we're talking about machine God will solve all our problems, sounds a little bubbly.
>> Yeah, that's the kind of stuff you look back on and say, "Oh, yeah, that was the top."
>> I know that we we have to talk about this and that requires some numbers, so I have some notes. But the interesting I mean you can make a case for either side and it kind of hinges on not so much what AI looks like in the future but more where we are in the cycle. If the question is is AI a bubble? Yeah, probably. It's a new technology. It's exciting. Every single time we've the railroads, the you know com if it's not a bubble, it will be and it probably is already.
>> But where are we in the bubble? That's the interesting thing for investors. So if you look at kind of where are we in the financing side? When we had the.com bubble, the big thing uh are you guys familiar with dark fiber?
>> No.
>> So essentially they were building out this kind of infrastructure for the internet and uh the the conviction of the day was the internet's going to be the biggest thing in the world. Correct. And 97% of the fiber that was laid was called dark fiber because it wasn't lit up. It was just laying there because eventually we're going to need it. That's not the case right now. Every single time that one of these data centers comes online, you're at 100% utilization. There's no dark fiber. And we're continuing to need more. I mean, I don't know if you guys saw Sora 2, more than 70% of the content that we consume is video.
>> So, a video model makes a lot of sense. It's also way more computensive. And the the final form of chat AI is not chat bots. It's going to be video. It's going to be robotics which use video models. So that's kind of like the the bullish side, but I totally see I have some numbers here. So we've had some of these circular deals. Um
>> and uh
>> so far I mean
>> there's hundreds of billions of dollars for this. Most of the financing is structured much more like toll roads or or LG terminals. The Meta Hyperion was $29 billion. uh 26 billion of that was PIMCO on debt and then Blue Owl with 3 billion of equity. An offbalance sheet arrangement which also was pretty popular during the com bubble. Then you have stuff like GPU collateralized SPVS. Coreweave has a 7.5 billion Blackstone SPV. There's like an 11 billion dollar GPUbacked loan market now which compared to the the infrastructure thing I can get the that it's like those GPUs are going to be worth like they will depreciate. So
>> that's that's ABS, right? That's like asset back securities. Okay.
>> Yeah. But when you look at the where we just saying where are we in the cycle? Well,
>> there's been there's been a lot of these off balance sheet arrangements. But in terms of that prisoners dilemma that we spoke about where nobody's going to back off because then maybe they risk not creating machine God. The debt to equity ratio on most of the hyperscalers is not crazy. Sure,
>> Oracle has the highest and but they still have a lot of room to lever up in pursuit of this goal. The interesting kind of dynamic of Nvidia finances its customers and then its customers buy Nvidia GPUs and then you know that yeah that's a bubble dynamic that's that's visible circular financing and and but the demand is real. Well, this is my this is I guess the question. If the demand is real, why are the Nvidia of the world financing their customers, right? Intuitively, you think, okay, Nvidia's the demand for chips is maxed out, right? Then intuitively, you think, well, then there's plenty of money elsewhere. So, do you have a uh guess for why Nvidia is impelled to, you know, invest in OpenAI, invest in Corewave? It's been a long time investor in Cororeweave and so forth. Yeah, I I could I could take the very skeptical view or the kind of not skeptical view. The not skeptical view is the best thing for Nvidia is that we accomplish AGI. So, anything that it can do to get us closer to that massive massive infrastructure that's required for that is great for them
>> as quickly as possible.
>> As quickly as possible because uh every year that you don't achieve AGI becomes less likely. So, uh, that is maybe the core factor. And then there's
>> it's good for for them and, uh, the the and playing into that
>> the because this this isn't necessarily like the dot bubble because the.com bubble had fiber and then it had, you know, pets.com and and Amazon and all that stuff. This is all pretty much capex, right? Tech is capital intensive again, which means that it's the bust won't necessarily be like the.com bubble where it gives the real players time to shine. If the capex spending grinds to a halt because the market goes down, that's the worst thing in the world. So, in a way, it's also it's in their interest obviously to make sure that that doesn't happen. Another [Music] question actually but and I want to ask it now because I might forget. Um there was a headline I think earlier this week again headlines almost every day. Can you explain why Meta which is building out which obviously hyperscaler they have tons of data center capacity. Why do they need to do a deal with coreweave? So I saw that meta is going to uh pay a few bill 14 billion some number for capacity on core. What can the what do the neoclouds bring to the table such that the legacy is like you know what we we want some of your capacity?
>> It's basically I would say anything you can do to shift that capex away from yourself is is great. Right? If if you're if you're right now a lot of this stuff is funded from cash flow and yeah, we're starting to see debt financing take its place, but if you the the you're running a company that's existed for a while and is one of the biggest companies in the world and yes, you could justify taking inordinate amount amounts of risk to do this, but just like anyone else, if you have a goal and you can kind of shift away some of that risk to because if you know, if Cororeweave goes bankrupt, Meta's not it's not it's not the worst thing in the world for Meta. What would you be looking out for for signs of the bubble bursting or I guess the capex um faucet starting to turn off?
>> So, in terms of like the uh warning signs first, monitoring used GPU prices, I think is a great way to to see what's going on. Seeing like contract renegotiations, waiver headlines from private credit, and also a big one would be any delays in delivering power. uh make it so that you finance this thing and then it's not going to be able to work
>> right. I do think that another in you really do have to kind of index to the revenue that's being generated by the AI companies as well. And I don't you saw OpenAI recently announced that they're uh basically allowing you to buy things with one click from the inside the app. Mhm.
>> And I think that that was also a big uh driving factor in the router where they kind of route your model to the it's it's it's setting it up for advertising cuz the other day I asked Google a pretty simple question and it just gave me the answer
>> with no advertisements delivered to me. So we need to I think that there is the killer apps kind of are here or coming but that has to happen fast.
>> Yeah. the um the fact that the internet kind of runs on ads is an underappreciated reality of our world and we did an episode on it way way back in the day. Is there any way if I wanted to get exposure to like the good stuff of AI, the actual money being spent, but then I don't like all the circular financing arrangements. Is there a way to hedge that particular risk? Yeah, you could uh you could uh buy all the real companies that are building this kind of uh data center and then you could short Blue Owl and the private credit companies that are doing the kind of uh financing aspect of it because if it goes bad, they have limited upside and kind of unlimited downside. And if it continues happening, the companies that are actually building it have unlimited upside and they're still like you said, these old line uh kind of industrial that like they still have a core business to go back to. What's your take on so OpenAI announced its new Sora thing that Tracy has a code for. Meta announced its Meta AI which a lot of people's like this is slop and I don't we don't need to get into a debate about whether this is all garbage. I kind of think it is but that's not actually the question I'm interested in. The question I'm interested in is one way to view these things is you know what these are going to be these video these AI videos are going to be really important sort of business revenue drivers in our pursuit to AGI and the other view is look if they were close to AGI they would not be devoting time to the slot factories and this is the sort of question and I'm curious from your perspective what do you think is the real logic behind all of this effort to create these sort of you know dumb like oh a video of a astron not riding a horse through space with a, you know, cowboy hat on or whatever.
>> Video models are going to become the most important part of this. You uh you need, for example, LLMs don't really interact with the world,
>> but we're starting to see in robotics AI models interact with the world. So you have these video language action models and you can structure it so that there was a interesting paper on archive recently that uh and you know this is uh video models like V3 are emergent zerosot learners and understanders and what that just means is you can give it uh basically like a second of context and then it can extrapolate about what's going on beyond that becomes extremely important for robotics and you can structure these vision language action models where you have uh like a slow reasoning model that is kind of like your conscious mind and determines what it needs to do and then you have like a fast model that actually does the movements and stuff. AI kind of extends into the realm of you need to generate as much data as possible and having, you know, video data and knowing what's good and what's bad is also very important. But yeah, to your question, Open AI probably does want to show that they're making more money. And I don't doubt that there are people there that truly believe that they're building the machine god. And I also don't doubt that they realize if they to have a shot at doing that, they need the market to play along and they need to keep growing their revenues. So I think there's a lot of really good counterarguments about like not necessarily are we in a bubble? Yes. Uh is the bubble over? Like there are good arguments for that. I don't think one of the I don't think that oh well they're leaning into like kind of this slops that you know it's a company. They're going to do whatever they can to make money. That's capitalism.
>> Um, you know, one of the things I think about another reality of our current time, this is kind of related, but if we're talking about video data, YouTube staying power has been like phenomenal, right? It's been around for decades now, and we haven't really seen any successful competitors.
>> Anyway,
>> well, since uh we wanted to talk about stocks that are going up, I I know
>> that's another one. Uh people kind of forgot that video takes up a lot more storage than text does. And if we're going to start just like throwing out the slop on video, the part basically one of the only areas of semiconductors that has gotten ignored has been storage. Not like not like memory like like uh RAM and stuff, but like hard drives and solid state discs like Western Digital and uh you know.
>> Okay. So Seagate.
>> Yeah.
>> That's what we're talking about. So this was a this was a $84 stock in late March and now it's a 254. That's where you're going, right? Okay.
>> Yeah. And yeah, there's a crazy there's a crazy chart,
>> but it has gotten attention, but you think it could go up more.
>> I think so. And I think that uh to illustrate that dynamic that's going to keep happening. Basically, you just keep looking at stuff where there's people say, "Oh, well, you know, there's a there's a glut of X and that's why this isn't going to win from AI." And then eventually the glut of X doesn't matter. It's a that that's what happened to Nvidia in the beginning of all this. There was a glut of crypto GPUs and now nobody car like when's the last time you heard someone bearish on Nvidia because there's too many crypto miners.
>> SanDisk was $48 in April 2nd. That's $126 stock. Pretty crazy. These are just these are like just the tools are just store just basic. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Crazy.
>> It's it is. And uh it's it I guess you could be worried by that or you could say this isn't uh this isn't like Nvidia doubling in a month necessarily, right? That it's just people discovering I think it's a good barometer which is important in a bubble that people are still paying very close attention
>> and uh you start to get worried when everybody just goes into the Cisco of it all. But these are real companies that have real products. Of course, there's some silly stuff that's happening, but it's not only silly stuff. It's not 2021 with the, you know,
>> yeah,
>> I don't need to.
>> So, speaking of on the ground research, or maybe I should say in the sky research. When it comes to robotics, you had a robot dog, right? One of those like really advanced ones.
>> We got a unitry robot dog. It is super impressive. It's also incredibly creepy when it stands up on its hind legs.
>> Yeah. Have you seen the video?
>> Yeah, I saw your video of it. Yeah.
>> It's uh and Unitry. We went and visited Unitry, too. And it's I've seen Boston Dynamics uh you know, spot robot, which is actually more impressive. Also could probably murder you like and and the interesting thing about Unitry is yeah, this the robot kind of feels like a weapon. It's very heavy and stuff, but it's even they're humanoid like it can't lift more than 8 pounds. And also, Unitry is not focused on like making the brain. They just want to make the hardware. And you go there and they were like, "Where's your LAR from?" Oh, well, we needed this specific thing, so we just made it ourselves.
>> H
>> Okay. Where what about your actuators? Well, we made those ourselves, too. Anything that they don't make themselves, they get within a 90 km radius of their headquarters.
>> Wait, where's their headquarters? It's in uh Hanghao.
>> Nice.
>> So, it's something where you're really that's the competition that we have stacked up against us in the US versus China. And
>> I think the interesting route that they've taken is
>> it's super advanced. You can code on it. You can you can already see videos of people, you know, buying them and making them do specific things. But they made them not super like it's not going to kill you. And that's a great way to get a bunch of training data because we don't have enough training data of what it's like to move around the world. We have the sum history of all human knowledge that's been recorded for text models, but we need more data for robotics. And I think that that's like an interesting kind of thing where they're just kind of sending these out into the world so that they can get enough data to actually make it safe enough to have a robot in your house.
>> How can anyone buy a unit dog? Like are they for is for sale online? Yeah, there there's a lead time, but uh I can get around it if you
>> Wait, how much are they?
>> Uh so they start at uh 3,000 and then uh we got the the super advanced one that you can attach a robotic arm to so it can manipulate its environment and that was $8,000. And then their humanoid is 16, which is like less than the cost of a used Honda.
>> That's not bad.
>> Well, 3,000 also the price for like a really good purebred dog.
>> Well, that's what I was going to say. Like right there people pay a lot of money for actual dogs. So yeah, it seems
>> Why are you looking at me?
>> Why do you think I'm looking at you?
>> Okay, James, that was so much fun. Thank you so much for coming in and uh sharing with us your your field trip observations.
>> Thanks, Rob. [Music] Joe, I think maybe it's the cynical journalist in me, but I get really nervous when we start saying it's different this time.
>> Yeah. I mean, it's always different. It's always the same. It's sort of there certainly, you know. Yeah. I mean, look, it's crazy and it's a lot of money and it's still, you know, we've been asking people on the podcast, what kind of use value are you getting out of this technology? And it's still very ambiguous. Um,
>> I don't know. I don't have It's not my job to time the market. So, I'm glad I don't have to have a view on all of this stuff. But I do think
>> that's a copout, Joe.
>> No, I do think I do think for Okay, what's your Okay, give us your Give us your price target. You That's a Okay, give give us your price target. Okay. Um, I do think this is moving so fast and every day the numbers are so big and it's the stakes are so high for all of this that it does feel like we just need regular updates on the state of how much money is being spent in this area and what the eventual payoff will be.
>> I want someone to draw a massive like infographic of all the financing details because I think you could make a really interesting one.
>> Yeah, you definitely could.
>> That would probably be illuminating. On that note, I did think James' suggestion of, you know, shorting the private credit players and then going long the actual physical hardware ones. That was interesting.
>> Yeah. No, it's really interesting. Also, I had not realized I mean, it is very interesting the way booms or bubbles, whatever you want to call it. I don't like using the word bubble because that applies whatever booms or bubbles, the way they spread out. I just think that's extremely interesting. Right. So Nvidia takes off in late 2022 when people are blown away by Chat GPT and they say this incredible and it's being powered by all these uh Nvidia chips and then people go on the hunt right for other things. It's like what else? And even still today in October 2025, that spreading out process continues. And so, okay, in the last few months, maybe it's like a caterpillar or maybe suddenly people realizing that just sort of old-fashioned computer storage is going to be very hot, but we're still in this phase where as people open their eyes to these things, the spreading out uh continues to this day.
>> Right. Well, also there's an expectation that eventually, you know, normal companies are going to benefit from it as well and become more efficient and all of that.
>> I just remembered I the one question I was going to ask James, but I could just throw it out as sort of a speculative question. So, he mentioned all of the workers. Could you ask all of the workers that are out this are building these things? And it does make me wonder about the sort of crowding out possibility. Like imagine if you imagine if you had some other business in Abelene and you're trying to hire an HVAC worker right now because HVAC, you know, you're like, "Oh, restaurant competing with like Open AI."
>> Yeah. You're like you're you have a restaurant in Abene and you're like, "You know what? I need to update my air conditioner or whatever or what and what are you going to do because all the HVAC workers are at that uh big Stargate operation." And I do think this is a very interesting macro question on all kinds of things, which is the degree to which all of this spending with uncertain payoffs will have a crowding out and potentially inflationary effect on the rest of the economy.
>> Well, presumably machine God will eventually design HVAC robots. So, problem will be solved.
>> Problem will be solved.
>> All right. Shall we leave it there?
>> Let's leave it there.
