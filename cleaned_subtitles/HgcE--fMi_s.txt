Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today we continue our discussion on collective representation.
In the previous video
We analyzed a very ancient
But the prevailing mental state in contemporary times
"Interpenetration rate"
When a person's subjectivity is underdeveloped
When unable to establish clear psychological boundaries
He will fall into a kind of
In the chaos where subject and object are indistinguishable
In his world
Subjective will can replace objective facts.
Emotional fluctuations are projected as hostility from the outside world.
He is no longer an independent observer
Instead, it sank into the environment.
Always feel
One is influenced by mysterious external forces
Penetration and influence
If we look at it from a psychological perspective
To examine individuals trapped in a state of mutual penetration
It can be found
The person involved is unable to integrate their own feelings.
and opinions of others
Their inner world
It is composed of split, broken fragments.
The parties involved have difficulty distinguishing between them.
"External events" and "internal feelings"
Because there is no continuous and stable self
Therefore, any disturbance from the outside world
They can penetrate his mind directly.
It became his internal pain
However, this leads to a question
A deeper question:
If "interpenetration" is a primitive...
It could even be described as a naive way of thinking.
So, in a scientifically advanced world
A modern society with awakened rational consciousness
Why this way of thinking?
They weren't naturally eliminated?
It seems to possess a tenacious vitality.
Able to transcend the cycles of history
In every social frenzy
Being constantly copied and reproduced
This is the concept we're going to discuss today.
"Collective Representation"
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
So what is a collective representation?
In Lévy-Bruhl's definition
Collective representation
More than just collective consensus as we usually understand it
or public opinion
Because of consensus, public opinion, and ideas
Both are products of language and reason.
Collective representation is even more powerful than these.
It is something that exists prior to the individual.
And a kind of forced acceptance by individuals
Atmosphere, aura, or air
This collective representation
Usually in some important ceremony,
Must be followed
Formed from customs, traditions and habits
In these situations
The parties involved will be affected by this collective atmosphere
Completely encircled and surrounded
So much so
Even if the person is separated from the group environment
Living alone
Just by thinking about those things...
Intense emotions will also arise immediately.
Any rational thought will be drowned out.
In "Primitive Mind"
Lévy-Bruhl recorded
In French Congo and other regions
Witchcraft Trial Procedure:
When an important person died
Or someone's death was suspicious.
The whole village would gather together for a meeting.
At this time, the wizard or witch doctor
The ceremony is about to begin.
These mysterious rituals, though without reason
But everyone believes this can expose the criminals.
At such gatherings
Even the bravest person
The thought of being called out
He was about to be convicted.
And he died as an object of public condemnation.
I also tremble all over.
Why is he shaking?
Because in that atmosphere
Any personal arguments and protests
They are all completely useless.
Collective representation
It possesses an unquestionable authority.
If you don't accept
Not just a cognitive error
It is also a moral sin
When an individual is in such a situation
When surrounded by a collective that completely envelops you
His thinking can only be based on collective emotions.
Or an appendage or projection of the collective unconscious.
It is chaos and original logic
So-called original logic
According to Lévy-Bruhl
This primarily refers to a kind of indifference towards conflict.
The law of contradiction is a fundamental law of formal logic.
that is
For the same object
You cannot make two contradictory judgments.
We cannot both affirm and deny.
Maintain consistency in thinking.
However, under the shadow of collective representation
Human thought is not bound by the law of contradiction.
He didn't perceive any chaos here.
Lévy-Bruhl gave examples in the book.
The Porro people believe they are long-tailed parrots.
In their view
One can be a person
It could also be a bird with bright red feathers.
They are the same as parrots.
They and the parrot
They share the same very mysterious essence.
"I am a human" and "I am a bird"
These two contradictory judgments
They can reach a consensus in their thinking.
Some might consider this a kind of poetry.
For example
We might joke about it sometimes.
I am a cat
I am a bird
but
This is completely different from that original logic.
When we say these words
To be able to recognize that this is a metaphor
We can distinguish
What is the real world?
What is symbolic meaning, the spiritual world?
We will not confuse the two.
But for primitive thinking
This shore and the other shore
The real world and the spiritual world
They permeate each other.
They are completely one world.
thus
Everything in this world has also been shrouded in mystery.
Even two things
Completely different in physical properties
The parties involved may also believe in the realm of mystery.
These two things are essentially the same.
Therefore, there is no contradiction.
And this mysterious atmosphere
It is guaranteed by the coercive power of collective representation.
certainly
We modern people don't say "I am a bird".
This kind of totem worship language
However, collective representation
The law of interpenetration has not truly disappeared.
Modern people use many
Seemingly rational concepts
Even philosophical discourse
To package this primitive thinking
For example in China
People really like to use
Essentially, it's about "starting from the big picture".
"Look at it dialectically" and "take the political account"
These seemingly philosophical terms
However, since the parties involved did not provide an explanation...
What are essence and phenomena?
What are the big picture and the details?
What are the political and economic costs?
This leads to this so-called "essence".
In fact, it's no different from the mysterious world of primitive people.
The result is that it can stitch together all opposing concepts.
By adding the phrase "look at the problem dialectically".
The parties involved not only eliminated their self-contradictions
It even produced a kind of
The sense of superiority that "I have grasped a higher truth"
For example, during the Great Leap Forward
On the one hand, people highly admire science and truth.
Emphasizing materialism and objective laws
Mocking religion as backward feudal superstition
However, the next second
This attitude can also
Seamlessly connected to
"The bolder the people, the greater the harvest."
Believe in the spiritual atomic bomb
It is believed that grain production can break through physical limits.
In North Korea
The main idea emphasizes on the one hand
The people are the masters of the revolution.
A driving force of history
On the one hand, it can also create sun worship
This very primitive thing
The leader is seen as the sun
Wherever the light shines, it brings light.
Under that collective atmosphere
The parties involved did not feel
What's wrong with this seamless switching?
Because of this mysterious revolutionary spirit
It has already permeated the physical world.
Rice is not only a plant
Rather, it is the physical carrier of revolutionary will.
The same
The Spirit of a Leader
With abstract meaning
and the people's will with mysterious significance
They are completely the same
Worshiping a leader is worshiping the people themselves.
As for how miserable the lives of individual people are...
None of this diminishes this mysterious unity.
So here's the question:
In modern society
This "grand collective representation"
How exactly does it get into our brain?
And what about suppressing our ability to think rationally?
We all know Descartes' famous quote.
"I think, therefore I am"
This is also a profound tradition in Western philosophy.
First-person authority
It means that
An individual
Able to be direct, transparent, and accurate
Knowing one's inner state
From the perspective of rationalist philosophy
I know what I'm thinking.
This is the natural starting point.
They assume
The subjectivity of the mind is innate.
Kant was the culmination of this philosophical tradition.
All his philosophies
All of these are based on the premise that human beings are rational agents.
This is based on the premise
This is certainly very profound.
But it may have overlooked
Having a clear and independent
A rational subject capable of self-examination
This is not the starting point of the human spirit.
On the contrary, it was an achievement fraught with difficulties.
in other words
The threshold for this starting point is very high.
People are not carrying
A brain capable of "I think"
The one who came to this world
On the contrary
When we are born
Living in a
Chaotic, boundless
In the ocean of emotions
There
Without "me"
There was no "you" either.
Only a cluster
Vague fear, hunger, and anger
So
That rational subject capable of my thinking
Where does it grow from?
It is a person's emotions in an attachment relationship.
Products that achieve good mirroring
As we did on September 7th last year
The video says
The budding of a child's self-awareness
Those in need of care
It can reflect and mirror children's emotions.
At the same time, not going
Suppressing and engulfing children's emotional world
When children discover
The signal he sent
It can evoke a response from caregivers.
At the same time, he himself
When the caregiver is not consumed by their emotions.
He will have a crucial feeling
I can influence others.
This feeling
It's about "execution" and "proactiveness".
And the true origin of "self-confidence"
It is precisely in this situation
In the process of confirming emotions time and time again
Children rely on caregivers as intermediaries
Learned to distinguish:
This is my anger.
That was a mother's comforting words.
"This is what I need."
That's external satisfaction.
In this process
The chaotic emotion was named.
The vague feeling was structured
A complex, advanced
Self-awareness with independent boundaries
And that's how it came to be.
When children discover
Self-expression through specific emotions
When able to evoke a specific response from the caregiver
Using caregivers as intermediaries
Children can distinguish
And name your various feelings
And it has produced more complex
and higher self-awareness
so
Rationality doesn't fall from the sky.
It is made up of countless moments that have been seen.
Accumulated
This involves
Another important concept we've discussed before
Implicit relational knowledge
In this video from February 16th
We said
Implicit relational knowledge
It is when an individual establishes intimate relationships with others
Gradually formed
Knowledge about how to interact with others
This kind of knowledge does not exist in the form of language.
Instead, through non-verbal and emotional means
and interactive methods
Subtly
Influences our behavior and interaction patterns
Collective representation is not merely a concept.
It is also an omnipresent relational field
In this field
It has gone through countless times
Small, non-verbal interactions
Continuously improving our implicit relational knowledge
To rewrite and shape
for example
At family gatherings during Chinese New Year
Everyone was clinking glasses and exchanging toasts.
Several elders
He started teasing a young woman in the family.
She's so old and still not married.
Cannot find object
Or perhaps they're joking about her low income.
Not pretty enough, etc.
These words are very hurtful.
But in that scene
Everyone felt it was very natural.
The whole occasion was filled with joy and harmony.
A warm and tender atmosphere
Even the girl who was being teased
He also awkwardly smiled.
At this time
As an observer
There might be an urge to stop this atmosphere.
But at the very moment he opened his mouth
You feel a huge, invisible resistance.
You'll feel like you're the one ruining the atmosphere.
It's that immature, overly serious one.
Disappointing oddball
You might implicitly think
I've had similar experiences before.
The fear of being ostracized and isolated
You might also think of
You will continue to live in this family in the future.
What if I offend someone like this?
So you start to rationalize all of this.
for example:
Everyone seems to be having a good time.
Those elders didn't mean any harm.
It's just an expression of concern.
At this moment
You've accepted this group atmosphere.
Suggestion and inducement
Let's turn our attention to another one.
A scene familiar to all Chinese people
High school campus
In this field
"Implicit relational knowledge" is not derived from eye cues.
Or perhaps it was learned from a warm and affectionate atmosphere.
Instead, it is instilled through high-intensity rituals.
for example
Chinese high schools often have some strange slogans.
Life can be reincarnated
The National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) is held only once.
And this sentence
Why sleep so much before death, when you'll have plenty of time to sleep after?
We would feel
These words are simply unbelievably abstract.
The college entrance examination has been turned into a form of death worship.
but
When an individual is in that classroom
At that rally
Or the scene of college entrance examination mobilization
In that kind of stirring music
Uniform slogans
Under banners everywhere
I believe most students
It doesn't seem absurd.
On the contrary, it will make you feel excited.
I remember reading an inspirational book in high school.
The author will take the college entrance examination
Comparable to the Battle of Shimen in the War of Resistance Against Japan
This battle
Known for its large-scale melee and hand-to-hand combat.
The author vividly describes the brutality of that war.
And encourage students
Summon the courage to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.
Go prepare for the college entrance examination
But there is a very strange place here.
In war
The soldiers were facing a common enemy.
Soldiers among each other
They truly rely on and support each other.
However
The National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) is essentially a zero-sum game.
Your competitors
Not a big boss called the College Entrance Examination
It just so happens to be your classmate
You scored one point higher than your classmate.
So the classmate became the one who didn't work hard.
therefore
This is based on the shared effort for the college entrance examination.
The camaraderie that arose
It's actually very fake.
Because of this goal
It's in itself dismantling this kind of relationship.
On the surface, everyone seems very united and friendly.
Deep down, it's hard not to be calculating.
Their rankings and social classes
To distrust and defend each other
When the college entrance examination ends
The fictional common enemy vanished instantly.
The kind of camaraderie maintained by injections of adrenaline
It will also collapse.
All that's left is a mess of emptiness.
And a kind of deep-rooted
Distrust of interpersonal relationships
Chinese classmate reunion
It's easy to make it look very tacky.
They weren't reminiscing when they got together.
Instead, they were full of vigilance.
Pay attention to how well the other person is doing.
Therefore we say
This collective representation not only suppresses rationality
It also poisoned
The ability to build real interpersonal relationships
Speaking of which
Maybe friends
It evokes a sense of despair regarding humanity:
Are people really that fragile?
It's easy to be influenced by the group.
Is it a mob that is implied and manipulated?
Is this simply the worst aspect of human nature?
I don't think so.
On the contrary
I believe in this "social nature" of human beings.
On the contrary, it is the noblest place for humankind.
Humans can communicate through empathy and attachment.
Link with others
This ability is a double-edged sword.
It can be used to manufacture
A collective manifestation of blind obedience, manipulation, and ignorance
But it can also give birth
A person's free individuality
The key is not whether you belong to the group.
And in
Your social connections
Is it rich, open and diverse?
This is similar to the checks and balances in politics.
If a country has only one absolute power
Then it will inevitably move towards despotism.
The same
If a person's life
Only one type or class of collectives exists.
for example
He is both a subordinate of the unit
Another junior member of the family
The logic of these two is completely isomorphic.
So
This monotonous, high-pressure collective atmosphere
It could only suffocate his rationality.
Turn him into a timid and submissive person
but
If a person can possess
Multiple and independent social identities
In these different circles
You follow completely different rules.
Playing completely different roles
It is precisely between these different identities
Tension, Conflict and Balance
It provides you with a huge psychological space
In this space
You can jump out of any of them.
The constraints of a single collective
To examine and judge it
As Qin Hui said in "Pastoral Poetry and Rhapsody"
As mentioned in
A free and individualistic personality is not innate.
Ultimately
It is the development of production and social interaction
The product of the rich social connections formed
certainly
We need to be wary of a false kind of pluralism.
Some societies seem very lively
The division of labor is very detailed.
Seemingly highly differentiated
But in reality
They still share the same kernel.
For example, most county towns in China
On the surface, there are government and schools
Hospitals, businesses, etc.
But the economic lifeline of the entire city
It's actually the civil servant economy.
Wherever you go
You are in a state of...
Under the pervasive atmosphere of the system
People's values
Way of thinking, unspoken rules
They are all highly similar.
That's all for today's video.
