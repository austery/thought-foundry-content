People talk about this k-shaped economy.
Is that real or is that a man?
I absolutely believe so, but I think that
it's a little bit more nuanced.
And so, you know,
one of the things that we spotted
late last year
and we're tracking into this year was that
we weren't the first to see
that it was a k-shaped economy,
but a lot of people
were making the assumption
that the k-shaped economy
was being driven by income levels.
But when we were looking at the data
at the time, we were seeing that
those that had were in sort of the higher
income level.
In our case, that's 150,000 above.
So that's not your, you know, people
who were running hedge funds and music
and, you know, but still it's
the relatively better to do, cohort.
They were actually seeing the highest year
over year increases in delinquency
rates at the time.
So we knew that okay, hold on a second.
It isn't as simple as this.
So, you know, we spend a lot of time
and thought a lot of banks
and we kind of collaborated
with them to try to understand what's
what's really then the differentiator.
And then what seemed to be a really
a part of this is wealth.
So, you know, a lot of people
don't necessarily differentiate
income and wealth, but they are separate.
Yeah.
And so, you know, when you're looking
then at a high income
cohort at a time to try to see like, okay,
well which ones are doing well.
Which ones weren't.
Homeownership
was the biggest differentiator
because they had a bigger cushion
something they can rely on, rely on.
And then obviously other indicator
other aspects as well like stock ownership
and and small business ownership etc..
But homeownership is is the one
that has the more and the bigger effect
because there's more people in the US
economy on a whole.
And then let's say has a stock portfolio.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
I feel like
I just do not have any feel right now,
unlike the state of the consumer. Really.
I mean, your k-shaped economy, 
labor market slowing down.
Then there's like lowest layoffs in years.
You go outside, everything looks booming.
Like I just have no feel right.
I think sentiment is terrible,
but consumer sentiment is terrible
for years and people keep shopping.
I have no sense of it. Right?
Well, consumer sentiment actually came in
higher than expected most recently.
True. Big surprise.
But I was going to say are you not out
shopping for Christmas presents?
It's insane. Right? Yeah.
There's a lot of people buying
a lot of stuff, buying a lot of stuff.
But I think this gets to the K-shaped
economy point,
which is if you have a cohort
of wealthy people who are buying more, it
more than offsets the lower income people
who are buying less at lower prices.
So it's really hard to tell.
It's really hard to tell.
One thing
that, definitely feels different.
You know, if you look at aggregate
measures of household balance sheets,
like this is something
that is very different than sort of like
pre grade financial crisis.
The, the the general view
is that the American consumer
or the American household
has a very big cushion.
There is a lot of home
equity built up there.
It is not a thin layer.
Obviously anyone with money
and any sort of,
you know, investment account has done
phenomenally well.
We're recording this December 12th
yesterday, I think the S&P 500 hit yet
a new all time high.
So if you have any sort of home
equity buildup,
if you have any sort of investment,
you are doing very well.
On the other hand, of course, people
are stretched from years of inflation.
We know that hiring has, slowed down.
We know that, you know,
we see these headlines, delinquencies
for cars have like shot up.
But I've been seeing these headlines
for years.
I don't totally know what they mean or how
apples to apples they are with the past.
I just don't know.
I just I'm very confused.
Yeah.
You know what's really interesting to me,
just from a financial perspective?
Yeah.
If you look at some of the bonds
that were actually built on consumer
loans, the weakest ones are now from the
like 2020 to 2022 period.
Oh, was that so?
See, this is another interesting
element of measures
like delinquencies and why I sort of
wonder like how comparable they are.
Because okay, partly a delinquency measure
is a snapshot of a moment in time.
Right? A snapshot of health.
But it also inherently reflects
something in the past
because it reflects, you know,
what were lending standards at the time.
Right. Exactly.
So, you know, and that was a period of low
interest rates.
Everything was turning on Wall Street
banks.
Yeah. Give money to anyone.
Anyway, we need to get a better picture
of exactly what's going on.
How stressed is the consumer?
How much do these delinquencies
just reflect the profligacy of lenders
during the boom times
when rates were nothing, etc.?
And, yes, we need to figure this out.
Especially we're in the middle
of shopping season and all that stuff.
So I'm very excited to say
we really do have the perfect guest.
We're going to be
speaking with Rikard Bandebo
He is the executive vice president, chief
strategy officer, chief economist
at VantageScore,
a credit scoring company.
Rikard, thank you so much
for coming on the podcast.
Thank you for having me. It's an honor.
What is VantageScore, a U.S.
credit scoring company.
What do you do there?
So we're the largest credit
scoring company in the United States.
And we were founded almost 20 years ago
by the three credit bureaus
TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.
And we sort of created,
with a very specific mission
in mind to to drive greater competition
and credit scoring.
Prior to us, that really wasn't
a lot of choice in this space.
We've also there to create sort of drive
more innovation
and create the most predictive scores.
Which was a big ask from the banks
at the time,
and also to be able to expand access
to millions to enable everyone
who really is creditworthy to be able
to get access to credit products.
You mentioned the banks.
Just then.
Can you expound a little bit
more on your customer base?
Yeah.
So, you know, we used
obviously the primary use case that most
people think about when it comes to credit
scores, is for lending, right?
When you know, you're applying for a loan
and they want to evaluate whether or not
you're going to be able to perform
on that loan,
they'll often pull your credit score
as part of that process, but it's used in
many other stages as well.
So, for instance,
many people who are applying
to rent in a new apartment
building may also get asked for it.
When you are trying to get a utility.
Definitely in New York,
you get asked for it.
Yes, you certainly do.
And utility bills, telephones,
anything that involves a long term
commitment on payments generally.
Now, you'll often
get asked to provide your credit score.
So I just explained for the way you were,
you were started by whom?
20 years ago, we were a joint venture
by Experian, Equifax and TransUnion,
the three national credit
reporting agencies.
I don't understand what's the difference
between these major companies
that we've all heard of that provide
a credit score, etc.
that they such founded you like?
I mean, what do you do
differently than them?
Well, so what they do
is they're the ones who, who, collect
all this data from lenders and others
on your credit performance record.
They call credit bureaus.
They collect that
they're highly regulated.
But then most lenders can't just
make sense of all of that data on its own.
They need some guidance to help to
translate that into a what does that mean?
Right? Okay.
And so that's where our scoring algorithm
comes into effect.
Right.
And so the scoring algorithm helps
to take in all these hundreds
of different factors about you.
Yeah. To try to then
determine what does that mean
about your propensity to pay okay.
You mentioned predictive analysis as well.
What exactly is that
and what's that based on.
Well so when credit scores are created
right.
The aim the goal is to try to evaluate
what is the likelihood of somebody
going to, default on a payment
over the next 24 months.
So when you see that score, the score is
actually a translation of a probability.
Yeah, I don't odds right.
To evaluate what is that risk
and how
did we
end up with the system of Fico scores
in the US because it has like
an interesting history?
Well, you know, back in the day,
fair Isaac, you know, they created
the first sort of known credit score.
They were the first ones to realize
that, you know,
there was a free and fair Isaac.
Is that focusing? Yes.
Oh, okay. Yes. Keep going.
Let's go back a bit. Right.
So in the old days,
you know, lending was not necessarily
the most fair system
that there was, right.
You know, they may want to call up
your previous employer,
they may call your landlord,
they may just ask around.
And if they don't know anything about you,
you know,
there was a lot of judgment involved
in lending a lot of racial discrimination
as well. That certainly was built
into that system. Right.
And so, then there was a law career,
the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
They said, like, you can't do that.
You need a, you know, a better system
that is fair.
And that is a better quantitative ability
to assess people's risk.
Right.
And that created than this,
need to be able to consolidate
all this quantitative information
in a way that lenders could easily use it.
So, you know, a
Fico was the first fair Isaac at the time
was the first to create that.
And they did very well doing so.
But, you know, then there was a need for,
competition, innovation
and there was a lot of frustration
around the time of 20 years ago
that there was only one game in town,
and it
and it didn't score about 20% of the US
population.
It still doesn't.
And so and then a lot of lenders were felt
frustrated.
Like, like if it doesn't work for 20%
of the population, there's a problem.
We need something different.
And so then and the bureaus took
the unusual step of actually coming
together to create an alternative.
And that became Vantagescore interest.
Can I, as a consumer,
go, credit score shopping.
So the, first of all, there's
different ways to, to use it, right?
So a lender will typically choose
the credit score
that they're going to use for being able
to, underwrite alone with you.
And often,
you know, they'll use many more factors
than just a simple credit score, right?
Particularly the more sophisticated ones.
However, when you're trying to understand
what your situation
is, you had lots of different places
you can go.
You can either go to the credit bureaus,
you can go to the likes of Credit Karma.
There are many different services
out there, but I can't force the lender
to look at a specific don't look at yeah,
look at this one over here.
It's great. You get a second opinion.
No, I'm afraid not.
That's not how it works.
It's really,
you know, the lenders try to determine
what is the most appropriate score
for their product and different.
And there are many, many different schools
out there that schools
that are in some cases built specifically
for types of products, like auto loans
and the other schools
that are schools that are generic,
that can be used for any type of product.
What do you do? See,
you collect more data.
And you mentioned that there is this wide
swath of the population that doesn't that
that wasn't
being captured by the credit bureaus.
What do you do
additionally, on top of them
to expand the pool,
find potentially creditworthy borrowers
that the, that the,
that they had been missing before.
So, you know,
the the the thing is that, 
the quality and the types of data that's
been collected by the credit bureaus
has improved significantly over time.
Okay.
And so when we started
creating our algorithms were,
you know, the current version that's now
being adopted for mortgages, the version
four, we're releasing version
five this year.
We obviously we actually go
and rewrite the whole thing each time
so that each time we can come up with
the most accurate way based
on the current data available
and our current ability to understand
how consumers are behaving,
because that behavior changes over time.
You know, other companies,
what they've done
is they built a model long time ago.
They don't like to necessarily revealed
everybody how it works.
The secret sauce. Right.
So when you're seeing that as a chief risk
officer,
and there's a new model coming along,
either you want to understand that it's
going to be very similar to the previous
one to be okay with it, or you need to
get a lot of transparency in how it works
so you can get comfort in this new model.
So I think there's
the big divergence in strategy.
We go back to boots and redo everything
from scratch each time,
but in the same time provide an awful
lot of transparency and a lot of tools
so that lenders can get
a really good understanding of
exactly how this is going to work
and how it's going to behave
in different situations.
And they can test it out right.
Whereas the other one is still working
with many limitations
that have been in place
since the very first models.
And because of those limitations,
that's a big difference in why,
we score a lot more people.
So I give you a very concrete example.
So for instance, one of the limitations
that the others have is that
if you haven't had any credit activity
for the past six months,
you're not going to get a score.
So you could just imagine somebody
that is,
to watch the military
been deployed overseas or anything else.
Right.
But the good thing is, you know,
starting about, you know, 15 years ago,
the bureau started
collecting and storing data
so we could use time series data,
because who'd have thought
that time series
data could be useful in prediction, right.
Completely strange idea. Right.
So with
with Vantagescore before we started
and using trended data time series data.
And with that
obviously we can see about 24 months.
So yes, if there's a gap
in six months of history, it's important.
But we're still able to see what happened
before then.
Right.
And that gets rid of,
you know, tens of millions of people
when you have that constraint.
There are other constraints in there too.
So people that are new to credit.
So if they haven't had a full six months
of history, again, they won't get scored.
And then if they only trade lines,
they won't get scored.
Right.
And so what we've been able to do
is to deal with those constraints
in a different way by a using time series
data, b using some other data points.
So we were the first to use M
utility payments and rent.
I mean, who'd have thought
that your ability to pay your rent could
somehow, again, be useful
in trying to assess your your risk?
Right.
And so,
you know, including those new
different types of data, realizing
that these constraints can be changed
now that you have time series data,
but then also guess what?
You know, math has evolved as well.
Okay.
And so, you know, what we realized too
was that you if you can be really smart
and use some new methods like,
you know, some AI methods, for instance,
like clustering to really understand,
well, look, here's a group of people
and they behave in a certain way.
And by doing that in a better way, we can
then figure out what is the best way
to measure this group of people here
versus this group of people here.
And doing that well enables you
to build much more predictive scores.
And so that's an important
the answer to that.
Not a lot of people always realize
is that it's not one
formula
that's calculating everybody's score.
You know, people will get depending
on what their credit file looks like
and the history looks like,
they'll get divided into, you know,
different segments, and then each segment
is scored according to that.
And that again
increases the ability to score people
accurately and score more people
like in our case, it's 33 million
more people that we're able to score.
So it's quite substantial.
How did the models deal with, breaks
in previous consumer patterns?
Because we have seen,
some major ones in recent years.
So after the pandemic, we had phenomenal,
a phenomenally tight labor market.
And we saw a lot of wage growth
for lower income,
a lot of spending that was sort of
unprecedented in many ways.
How do models actually incorporate
that sort of big shift in the trend?
So I think that's something
really important to try to understand.
And it's
and it's not easily understood by many.
So give me a second here.
I'll try to break this down.
This is no we have when people say,
give me a second,
I have to break this down.
Please break it down.
You can have a minute.
Have a minute.
Honestly, that's kind of what I enjoy
most about listening to your, podcast.
Yeah.
And so, like,
the first thing to understand
is that this credit score
is not an absolute measure of risk.
It's a relative measure of risk.
And let me break that down for you. Right.
So what it means is that,
you know, a score,
if somebody did score 720 in 1 month
and then somebody else has score 723 years
later, the risk will be different.
And the reason for that is very deliberate
when we are evaluating a person.
Right.
Because of the laws of the fair Credit
Reporting Act.
Right.
We're allowed to look
at the things that are about you,
but there are things that are going out on
at the same time in the economy
that impact risk of the population
as a whole.
Right?
So that's why it's so important
when you're looking at things
like credit scores to understand
when was that score pulled?
Right.
Because the score, 720 in 2017
had a very different characteristic,
of a score of 720 in 2022.
Okay.
Now, but the thing to bear in mind is
this is an excellent
relative measure of risk.
So at any one given point in time,
you know, somebody with a
720 is going to be much better
performing than somebody at 630.
And the same time somebody at 840 is going
to be much better than both of them.
Okay. And that holds consistently true.
And so that's why it's very important
and still
obviously very important to include
when you're making lending decisions.
But you know, lenders
have to be thoughtful, right?
They have to as they're making decisions
about, you know, how many people
they want to be to underwrite
and how to think about risk.
They need to also start thinking
about these external factors as well,
so that they can then, you know,
set their underwriting criteria
to meet the kind of level of risk that
they're willing to take on this mixture.
I had never thought about this,
but of course, that makes so much sense.
So it's like I could have an excellent
credit history.
I could have ex employment
pay all my rent, but for example,
if the economy is going down the tubes,
I may still yet
be a risky credit
because I may lose my job at some point.
And so this idea that it kind of
has to be relative
because the underlying conditions
that affect everyone are
they're outside of our control,
but they are still important
from the perspective of the lender.
Exactly.
And at the same time, you know,
if you get declined for credit card,
you can't be told that
the reason you're getting declined
is because unemployment has hit 5%.
Okay, right.
It's that doesn't work
that the laws are very specific.
The reasons for why you're not getting
the top score have to be explained,
and they have to be based on,
on, attributes and data, obviously,
that are specific to you.
What's the most important external factor
when it comes to credit scoring?
Because I've heard arguments for obviously
the labor market, the unemployment rate,
but also wage income
and therefore real disposable income.
How do you weight those different factors?
I mean, I think if you're a lender, it's
going to really depend upon
what types of consumers you're lending to.
Right.
And particularly
now we're seeing such divergence
across consumers in terms of who's
doing well and who isn't.
And so, for instance,
if you are a lender focused on people
that are kind of below prime,
let's say that not completely subprime,
but that near prime group and, and you're,
you know, you're focusing on auto loans
and you know, you're in regions like Texas
or in certain areas, then obviously,
the understanding the economic conditions
that are affecting those people, like,
you know, a lot of those people would be
working in certain types of industries.
What is employment
like in those types of industries?
Right. Or is it people
that are in the gig economy?
Right. And so, it is quite nuanced.
It's not necessarily one thing
and it's going to depend.
Whereas on the other extreme,
you know, if you're handing out
black cards
and your audience is incredibly affluent,
then again, you know, it's it's
less about the risk because at that point,
your risk of default is probably 1
in 10,000, right.
So they're they're just trying to make,
you know,
sure that it is absolutely risk free.
All right.
So someone in a
highly cyclical industry, like,
I don't know, truck drivers in Texas
or something that we're taking out, auto
loans would probably be seen as riskier
or the labor
market would depend more for them.
Whereas if you're taking out,
you know, a black Amex card or something
like that,
probably real disposable income.
Yeah. Okay.
So you mentioned different segmentation.
Is the,
people talking about this k-shaped
economy, is that real or is that a meme?
I absolutely believe so. But I think that
it's a little bit more nuanced.
And so, you know,
one of the things that we spotted
late last year
and we're tracking into this year was that
we weren't the first to see
that it was a k-shaped economy,
but a lot of people
were making the assumption
that the k-shaped economy
was being driven by income levels.
But when we were looking at the data
at the time, we were seeing that
those that had were in sort of the higher
income level.
In our case, that's 150,000 above.
So that's not your, you know, people
who are running hedge funds and etc.
and, you know, but still it's, it's
the relatively better to do cohort.
They were actually seeing the highest year
over year increases in delinquency
rates at the time.
So we knew that okay, hold on a second.
It isn't as simple as this.
So, you know, we spend a lot of time
and sort of a lot of banks
and we kind of collaborated
with them to try to understand what's
what's really then the differentiator.
And then what seemed to be really
a part of this is wealth.
So, you know, a lot of people don't
necessarily differentiate
income and wealth, but they are separate.
Yeah.
And so, you know, when you're looking
then at a high income cohort
at a time to try to see like, okay,
well which ones are doing well
and which ones weren't homeownership
was the biggest differentiator
because they had a bigger cushion,
something they can rely on, rely on.
And then obviously other indicator,
other aspects as well,
like stock ownership and
and small business ownership etc..
But homeownership is is the one
that has the more and the bigger effect
because there's more people in the US
economy on a whole.
And then let's say has a stock portfolio.
I talk more about mortgage rates
because this feels pretty key
when you're talking about
the k-shaped economy, which is if anyone,
anyone who bought their house before 2020,
is probably a very lucky person
and, has locked in a low mortgage rate,
I think mortgage rates are still even
after the rate cut, we're at like 6%
or something versus I think at one point
they got down to like 3%
right after the for people like 2.5%.
Yeah. Crazy.
Yeah.
And so if you bought a house
then you actually have this
like massive cushion,
as you put it, versus
someone who's buying a house now
or in the past couple of years in a way,
I see there's a bit of a silver lining
when it comes to housing, right?
We we have seen rates come down this week.
Hopefully they will continue to come down
next year.
Yeah, there's a lot of debate, obviously
even within the Federal Reserve. Mr..
Exactly.
The the speed at which that's
going to be accomplished.
And obviously there are many other factors
that can impact that.
But I the reason we see a silver
lining is to for two reasons.
Okay.
As interest rates comes down,
obviously for people to own homes,
that's their biggest monthly payment.
Right now there isn't much, point
for many to refinance given
what the interest rates are.
But if it comes down a bit more,
it'll be much more.
It'll make much more sense
for a large tranche of homeowners
that have higher interest rates
to be able to to make that switch.
So we'd expect a bit of a refinancing boom
as it hits a certain level.
But the other thing
that's really exciting
about what's happening
in the homeownership space is that in the,
this year, 
the FAA changed the rules about,
what can be used, what credit scores
can be used in mortgage.
So historically,
they've used a very old version.
That's from the 90s, of the classic
score, in, in mortgage applications.
And that was actually not
deliberately done.
So it was just that
it got written into the rules.
And then since then, as a recommendation,
but then it became kind of
the de facto a monopoly, in that space.
And the problem is that's a model
that, went through the last crisis
and the Federal Reserve,
a Saint Louis actually found that it,
it didn't work
well at all in that situation.
In fact, it saw a bigger rate of increase
in delinquencies amongst those
that were prime than it did amongst those
that were subprime.
So the rate of increase, which is not how
a model supposed to work, surprisingly.
Right.
And so, what's happening
now is that the,
they have allowed for vantagescore
for to be used.
And the reason I say that is it's a
because as I mentioned before, it
a lot more people,
when they have the ability
to get access to homeownership.
So that will create a bit more demand.
Okay. Right.
Which is great.
And the other thing to think about too is
who are these people
that, that get access to this.
Right?
It's a lot of people
that are not necessarily in the areas
that have been, have been so crazy
with house price increases.
Right. There are a lot of rural
communities, like.
So if you look at the state where there's
the biggest difference between
score of all people with a new score,
it's actually West Virginia.
And so those economies
could certainly do really well
from a change to more people
having home ownership.
And then the second thing
too, is obviously R&B is really important.
Had some challenges back in 2008, 2009.
Right.
And so having a better
plan is a very important, modest way.
I heard about those challenges.
I think they came up a couple of times.
I was educated in the UK.
Pardon me.
We have a tendency to understate
things, but, you know, having a newer,
more proven model, one that's,
you know, worked so well and credit card
and other things for the past eight years,
it's become the most used model in,
in many other segments.
So having a proven model
that's new and more predictive is
should help as well with reducing
the systemic risk in the arms market.
Just just to go back very quickly
because I don't I it sounded important.
Can you just clarify a little bit more.
What is this rule change such that could
unlock additional source of demand?
Okay.
So, when you went to a bank
before, wanted to submit loans to Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.
Okay.
They could only submit those loans
using the Fico classic score.
Okay, okay.
Which is actually 2 or 3 different scores
and go into that another point.
But anyway, and
and they used to be like a cutoff
that if you'd have 620
then you couldn't, be able to submit it.
You could go to an FHA, FHA loan.
But those are more expensive. Right.
But you couldn't necessarily
get a, a, a normal conforming loan
that goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
So that's not changed.
The first of all, that minimum
limit of Fico been removed.
And now,
they are just updating all the pipes
to allow them
to use Vantagescore as a choice.
So now there will be a choice.
Lenders can choose
which score they want to to use,
and they can make their own evaluations
about which one performs better.
Okay, so let's go back
to, starting at the end of last year.
And you saw that increase in
delinquencies among fairly,
people with decent incomes.
Maybe they didn't have as much.
Well, talk to us about the numbers.
How big were these numbers?
How much did they catch
people by surprise?
And what is the story there about why
there was this delinquency pressure?
Well, so,
you know, the good thing is it's available
since the end of last year.
But, you know,
when we're looking at this data,
then again, look, high income earners,
not surprisingly, have lower delinquency
rates than middle income earners.
And that had themselves lower
delinquency rates than the lower income.
Right.
But not a lot of people were looking
at that kind of year
over year trend and the momentum. Right.
I'm always looking at momentum
because I'm trying to get an early read on
kind of how things are developing.
And so at the time, you know,
we saw actually let's
go back a little bit
because I think it can explain
a little bit more about
what's going on in the economy.
Is that right?
So, when the pandemic happens, right,
a lot of stimulus comes
in, a lot of forbearance programs
are put in place as a result of that.
So many people's, you know, credit, health
and the way that they appear on the
on the credit files improved dramatically.
They're paying down their credit cards.
They were building up their savings.
It was a it was a good situation,
temporary, but good.
But then, you know,
20, 21, 22 starts creeping in
and we start seeing that, okay.
This is not a persistent situation.
This was a one off. Right?
And we started seeing delinquency rates
starting to come up again.
Right.
What we saw, which shouldn't be too
surprising, particularly given
that that was when inflation was kicking
in, in a, in a big way,
was that those
that were initially impacted
and who are seeing the biggest rises
were the lower income households.
Right.
So for the first sort of,
you know, six months, nine months,
that was the group
that was seeing the biggest year
over year increases.
But then what we started seeing was that,
you know, come 2023 forward,
we actually started seeing that,
then the middle
and higher income households
were starting being impacted, too.
And that's probably related to the fact
that lower income households
had less, disposable or income,
but they also had less
savings put away so that, you know,
they're the first to feel the pain.
But then when there is
this consistent imbalance
between your inflows and outflows, right,
you can even if you have, you know,
30,000 or 50,000 that's put away,
that's going to start depleting.
And that's what we started
seeing happening
even with these higher income households,
because at the same time, you know,
they were hit by so many pressures.
Right.
Biggest rent increases
I think we'd ever seen
it came into, you know, came into effect
those few years after Covid.
Right.
We saw things on, you know, car prices,
the cost of auto financing
going up through the roof
and then various other things,
you know, very other costs
also went up substantially.
And so, you know,
it's not that higher income
people were immune from this, right?
Also, you know, as an economist,
you know,
a lot of people always talk about, hey,
when inflation kicks in,
it disproportionately impacts
lower income households
because the cost of bread,
the cost of milk, etc..
You know, it's not like high income people
buy milk.
That's 100 times more expensive, right?
But the reality is, is
if you look at people's
big outlays, right,
many of those actually scale with income
rent, for instance, people
that earn more tend to rent higher.
Other big outlays such as,
you know, their, child care, education
and other things.
They also have been scaling
more with income.
Now, obviously there's a level of income
that you know that that does not apply to.
But if we still talk about that cohort,
150 to 250 or so of household income,
they're definitely seeing
that they felt the pain too.
They it took them longer before
it started impacting their delinquencies.
But they did start feeling the pain.
The good news though
is, that as we started
looking at the second half
of this year, right,
so we still saw those delinquencies
and high incomes
rising very heavily at the beginning,
the first half of this year.
But since July, 
and I've got data from October.
So, you know,
of the three of the four months
since July, we've seen that higher
income households came down.
So that's a good sign.
And the reason I say that's a good sign
is not because I'm a fan of
making the k-shaped economy even more so.
But the fact that so much of the U.S.
economy is driven by spending,
and you mentioned earlier
that high income households
disproportionately impact, that
and so if that dries up, that has a knock
on effect on the whole economy.
So to the fact that we're seeing
that cohort, that those delinquencies
are starting to come down, I think there's
some light at the end of the tunnel
that reminds me, actually,
I always wondered, how useful are big
shopping events
like Black Friday or Christmas
in terms of gauging consumer sentiment?
So you you always see the headlines.
You certainly saw them this year,
you know, record Black Friday spending.
But then you also see people break down
that spending and say, well,
actually it's
because everyone is so pressured.
They really need the low prices.
So they're buying everything.
Now, how useful
is something like that to you?
You know,
you can always see trends, right?
And so you know that from one perspective,
it's always good to
look at a number of different things,
such as spending on Black Friday, Cyber
Monday, etc., because, you know,
there are nuances into
how people have been spending
for those weekends over 20 years.
But still,
if you look at the last three years,
you can start to see things
that are happening.
But the thing that, you know,
I haven't been able to get my head around
is how much of that year over year
increase in spending in the holidays
is driven by the prices of the goods
going up.
Yeah.
Versus people buying things
that would have traditionally been more
expensive or splurging more
that for me isn't obvious.
And I think that again, when trying
to understand how the economy is going,
it's so important if you're looking at
from a spending perspective
to actually
look at the different merchants.
Right.
So how is McDonald's doing
and what are the trends there?
What's happening in high end?
How is LVMH doing versus,
you know, Walmart, etc..
And so, because again,
you know, even though I said that,
you know,
there's a silver lining in the high
income,
consumers are, you know, seeing declines,
middle income have come down,
but they're still increasing
and low income are are staying
persistently higher on 8% year
over year
increases, in their delinquency rates.
And so again,
there's we're probably next to you.
You're going to see more more households
struggling to make ends meet
than we saw this year.
I still don't think that there is,
you know,
you know, just looking at the trends
going to be any kind of major break point.
But the thing to bear in mind
with that, though,
is that if you look at here the situation
and you look at, for instance, JP
Morgan published that, you know,
the amount of cash people have in their
checking accounts is coming down.
So it just means that there is
more of a challenge if there's a big shock
to the system at some point.
Not that I can foresee
any shock to the system,
but it's always something to be
a little bit wary of before we going,
I want to go back to something
you said very quickly.
You said, okay, intuitively,
people with higher incomes,
they're going to have delinquencies
at a lower rate
than people's middle incomes,
and they're going to have, delinquencies,
a lower rate than people
with lower incomes.
That's not intuitive to me, actually,
because I would also
imagine
that underwrite is very different, etc.
it's not obvious to me
why higher income people default
less than lower income people,
because I would imagine
lenders know their income
and they're going to have, you know,
they're going to scrutinize the loan
of a lower income person
much more intensely, etc..
So why why should this trend exist,
given that they are don't they don't get
they don't don't get the same loan terms
or same loan availability?
No they don't.
And you know, a high income
household by typically is more expensive
than a car than a low income household.
Well, but higher income households
tend to have more of an ability
to squirrel some money away,
or they tend to have,
other assets that they can't or knows
that the lender knows
that the higher income, household
is going to have likely more savings
than the lender knows, that the household
that's in a very tight income
probably has very little, cushion
in the form of what we call wealth.
And so why doesn't that just get baked
into the underwriting standards?
Well, in in ways it does. Right.
And so, you know, when you're, you know,
you're underwriting a loan for, let's say,
somebody who is high income
and has a good credit history,
your expectation of their default
is going to be incredibly low, right?
So that's built into the pricing
and that's built into, you know,
and you obviously don't
just look at a credit score.
You look at, you know,
what their income is and various
other important metrics to be able
to determine the appropriate amount
that you will lend them, etc.. Right.
But higher income
consumers may not need to take on
as much debt
as a proportion to their income
as lower income households to make.
But, you know, to to get through
what they need to do. Right.
And so if you look at, for instance,
a high income household,
how much of their, even though,
for instance, probably housing and
car costs are some of the biggest outlays
they have, proportionately,
they're probably less than
for lower income households.
Right.
And so you know, a lot of it
has to do with that proportionality.
But then also just that, again,
they will tend to have a bit more reserves
so that they can ride through situations.
Talk to us about auto delinquencies.
Those have been rising.
And obviously there's a lot of lending
going on.
Again,
Tracy mentioned a sort of 2020 to 2022
vintage car prices
themselves are going up.
So not only have the rates gone up,
but we've seen a tremendous amount of auto
inflation.
So sort of stress at every level.
We see the numbers going
up. One of those tell us
as a fascinating story.
There's been a lot of interest,
that was paid attention to auto loans
because, you know, suddenly in 2022,
we started seeing this auto
loan delinquencies going up much faster
than other types of loan delinquencies.
And it was having a profound effect,
obviously, on auto lenders and
the economy as a whole. And, you know,
everybody is trying explain.
Well, you see, we got a bit too loose
during the period of Covid
and other things, and they started
adjusting their lending criteria.
Right?
So they did adjust their lending criteria,
around 2023 for most of them.
But then we started,
we still saw that despite that,
the delinquency rates
kept persistently increasing.
And then when we looked at the data,
we actually saw that, you know, when you
they had actually had an impact
by adjusting their landing,
their lending criteria, we saw that
the delinquency rates among subprime
auto lenders, where auto loans reduced
quite dramatically after that.
So they did have that effect.
But we saw that the delinquency rates on
near prime and Prime continued to go up.
And that was what drove that increase.
And so we realized there's
something more going on here.
And also why is it it's so different.
So we went back a long time.
We went back to 2010 to try to understand
kind of what's been going on.
Because not many people
look at it from that time scale,
but it's actually quite fascinating
because back in 2010,
auto had the best performance
of any loan product at the time,
it was the least risky.
This was always the narrative.
The Americans
will never give up their cars.
Even if they lose their job.
They can sleep in their car and
live in the car, which is very dystopian.
But that's I remember hearing that story
literally from a banker,
a banker who was actually working
on bundling phone loans.
And he was like, the other thing, right?
Yeah.
No one will give up their phone. Yeah.
So, you know, so at that time it was,
you know, it was a it performed well.
Right.
And people did not default as much on
that as on other products.
But then we've seen
it has transitioned over that 15 year
period to now, you know,
being the first quarter of this year,
it was the riskiest
credit product out there.
And then subsequently student
loans started coming in.
And that's another story.
You know, those delinquency rates
are at historic levels.
But on the auto loan side,
we then trot out what's causing this.
Right?
And so what we've seen was that,
there's a number of factors,
some of them obvious, some of them
a little bit more subtle, right.
The average cost of a car
has gone up an incredible amount.
And what we've seen is
then the average loan value for,
auto loans has increased
more than any other loan value.
And that may sound like okay,
but if you think about it, mortgages
tend to be the one that caused the most
because house prices
have appreciated so much over time.
So the fact that the average auto
loan has grown more than the average
mortgage has over
that 15 year period is telling.
Okay.
Secondly, obviously there is this
you know, there's this double whammy.
So not only is the car more expensive,
but then more recently interest rates
have been higher. Right.
And so you know,
they're not going to have to pay more,
not just for the principal
but also the interest.
But I think one of the things
that has caught many, consumers off guard
is, okay, so they're in the dealership,
they're being shown some numbers,
some people get it and they go like,
okay, yes, we can still do that.
We can make it work.
We can just about mix and stretch.
Because also I think
people are trying to buy either the same
that they had before or slightly better.
I know many people like downgrading okay.
And so they think, well, it's the same car
and yes,
there's a little bit more,
but we can make ends meet, right?
By looking at these numbers.
But what they often forget about
is that insurance has gone up
significantly,
as have just the cost of ownership.
Repair costs
have also gone up substantially.
And so when all those things
then hit them,
they can be in a situation
where we just can't make it work.
And so, you know, that's
that's not good.
And, you know, the good thing
is, of all the loan
products, mortgages are performing
pretty well.
Okay.
That's they are increasing,
but they're still much, much lower
than they were back in 2010
and obviously much lower than 28 to 29.
So, but if you default on a mortgage,
it takes some time before
anything really happens, right?
With an auto loan, they they will come
and they will take that car away from you.
And given that, you know,
so many people rely on that car
to go to their job, to make their income
to, you know, to do other tasks,
they're important, like they're shopping
or taking their children to the school
or other things that they need to do.
People don't willingly
just default on these auto loans.
And so I think it is a sign
that correlates with the fact that,
you know, more households are struggling
to make ends meet.
How much insight do
you have into leverage?
And the reason I ask is because we've seen
an explosion in buy now pay later.
Programs, virtually every site you go to
now has three different options
for getting a loan for a small amount,
and only a few of those.
My understanding is are actually reporting
to the credit bureaus.
So and I can also
imagine if you're a lower income person
who is perhaps more pressured,
you're
probably going to turn to a family member
and say something like, hey,
can you loan me,
I don't know, 500 bucks
to make it to the end of the month?
And there's no way that credit
scoring bureaus are going to have insight
into things like that. Informal loans.
There's, you know,
the credit data that comes from the credit
bureaus
is still incredibly productive and useful,
but it doesn't capture everything.
Like Alex was on I think recently,
a firm has is done to provision
data to the credit file, which is great,
but that not all of them are there.
And so, you know, I think there is
still a lot that's not visible.
And that is definitely a concern
to lenders.
We've been here their concerns about
stacking and and things of that nature.
Obviously, you know,
these companies haven't got to where
they are without having some understanding
of risk themselves.
Right.
So they're not going to necessarily
just let someone who's not performing
a loan take out another five Bnpl loans.
Right.
And the ability of a consumer to go to
all different Bnpl providers and use that.
There's a level of effort and
sophistication required to do that there.
Certainly I'm sure there going to be some,
but I don't know how many people fall
into that category.
Nevertheless,
it is a concern that more is invisible.
And that's why I think, you know,
being able to pull in more than credit
file data, such as cash flow data
becomes really important.
And so what we're seeing is that
there are more and more on,
that are looking to incorporate cash flow
into the process
because then they can have
a better understanding
of the ins and outs. Right?
Is their checking balance, 
going up or declining over time.
You know, are there is
that does our income look like it stable?
Does it look like it's more sporadic.
And so we still have started building now
credit scores that also incorporate
that type of data.
And that I think is going to become
even more important, as we go forward,
because there are going to be more
and more ways that consumers can borrow.
So that's probably the better way
to get that holistic view so quickly.
Auto delinquencies, are they
are they at their highest level
ever right now or close like. Yep.
I mean they are. Yes.
And so you know
and and they're continuing to to go up.
So what we have seen though is that credit
cards, for instance, they went up a lot.
So they went on to delinquencies.
Credit card
delinquencies went up a lot in 2324.
But they've started coming down
and we started seeing personal loans
coming down as well.
So it's a very nuanced picture.
So we've seen the and securitized,
delinquencies have started
coming down this year, year over year.
But we're still seeing mortgage and auto
loans continue that, you know, to continue
to increase, which is pretty topsy turvy
when you kind of think about it.
So the other thing happening now
is, insurance rates going up.
Because of the, I guess
non extension of previous subsidies.
And one thing you're seeing all over
social media is people
posting
their new insurance rates for 2026.
And I've seen some crazy ones,
you know, something going from $600
to like $1,800 a month.
How much pressure
would you expect something like that
to exert on the consumer for next year?
It's you
know, for many it's going to be the straw
that could break the camel's back, right?
It's just, you know, particularly
if it's just like car insurance
can be a very significant outlay
for for many households.
But, you know, there's other insurance
for homeowners.
Homeowner's insurance is going up.
And particularly if they're in areas
like California or Florida
where, you know,
natural disasters have led to, you know,
an increase in premiums
above the national average.
And so, again, like,
I don't see that there's
any one thing that is going to cause
a, the house to fall down.
But at the same time,
just there's more and more households
where that that one unexpected increase
puts them in a, in a, in a situation
that then makes it impossible
for them to make, their, their payments
that month or for a number of months.
Talk to us about the resumption of student
loan payments.
I mean,
you mentioned the importance of the it's
not only the stimulus,
but all that sort of forbearance.
And so all this stuff is the one thing
that just kept getting pushed
forever
was the resumption of student loans.
How much when
that when those numbers turned back on
or those payments turned back on.
How what kind of impact did that have?
And what are we seeing with student
loan delinquencies?
Yeah, it had a very big impact.
And so, you know,
if we look back before Covid,
the average, student loan delinquency
rate was around that 10% was sort of
wavering around
between 9 and 11% in that sort of range.
And then obviously in this five year
period, of, of forbearance, as I know,
reporting, because you had a period
of a year between 24 and 25,
through 24 where, they were
starting to need to make payments,
but they just weren't being reported.
So that's a basically
a long period of time
where people just got
used to not having to make that payment.
And also a very substantial part
of student loan borrowers who never had
ever made a payment because they,
you know, they finished their
their studies or they, you know, 
in a period when there was forbearance.
And so what then happened
was they started trickling
back onto the credit file
sort of mid-February of this year.
And then I think you got the first batch
really kind of come in by May.
And at that point you saw that
the delinquency rates on the student loans
that were not in deferment was over 20%.
So they were over
double what the historical norm was
since then.
And at the highest level ever,
it is the highest level
that we've seen going back a long,
long time.
So remember, there's been a lot of changes
when it was not federally mandated
and privately owned.
So I don't have visibility going back
as that far, but at least in recent
history, is absolutely the highest
by a very substantial amount.
And that's not too surprising.
But one of the things that we've seen
is that we expected that there would be
some people who go into delinquency
not because they intended to.
Right.
And so there were
some people who they moved
and they didn't get the addresses
or a lot of people that were confused
because there's so many mixed messages
like, we're going to be forgiven,
but there were not
and we're not certain program.
But now that program doesn't
exist anymore.
So, you know, some people have been able
to then address that.
And so it's come down to this or 17,
17.5%, which is a good sign.
And so that's improving.
But there still are people
who are on programs that have,
that have been killed,
like the, the Safe program.
And so they are going to next year,
have to either
get on to another forbearance program
or start making payments.
And so it's
maybe we haven't seen the full effect.
Then basically
of the resumption of student loans,
which we've seen the biggest batch
come through, but there still are
some more, cohorts of consumer borrowers.
That will either have their
existing program expire,
or that aren't being reported yet
because, and the servicers are trying
to figure out exactly what's going on
before they report to the credit bureau.
So there still is
a little bit of lack of visibility
there from on the credit servicer side.
Rikard,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
That was great.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Tracy, It always comes back
to, insurance doesn't it?
That's always like the thing the there's,
the little fly in the ointment is,
you know, you buy this car and it's like,
okay, here's the car
and here's the interest payment.
Oh, I think we can make the math work,
but you can't control what that insurance
payment is going to be.
You have no idea what it's going to be.
This is my theory. Insurers secretly
run this.
They were on the run.
The world. They really do.
You know, the other thing I was thinking,
and we've written about this
in the newsletter, but one of the
difficulties of our current economic
moment is there is so much division
and difference built into the aggregate.
If you're just looking at a single number,
a total, like if you looked
at the average Fico score of an American,
it tells you almost nothing now
because the
the individuals are so disparate.
Yeah.
And it really does come down to,
you know, wealth.
Right.
And there's this this is what wealth is
just such an important factor
in the economy.
We always talk about income
and income inequality
and of course that's a real phenomenon.
But wealth is such an important predictor
driver of anything.
And it also goes to show
like how important like
financial market and asset
prices are to the real economy.
And it gives me once again an opportunity
to say the stock market is the economy,
because we live in such a wealth
driven economy.
You know, someone once wrote into me,
I wrote something about pressures on lower
income people, 
and someone wrote into me saying, well,
why don't the lower income people
own more assets?
If they did,
they'd be in a better position.
Have you tried not being poor?
Why haven't you tried just being rich?
Why haven't you tried buying in video
20 years ago?
Why have you tried buying a house
in California in 2009 after the bust?
It's that simple.
Stop being poor. Seriously.
The other thing I was thinking
just on auto delinquency is I also think
the trade down story is a big piece here,
which is,
I mean, a car from ten years ago
now is pretty decent.
And I say that as someone who owns,
I think it's a,
Toyota Rav4 from like 2011
or something like that.
Oh, yeah.
Like it's pretty dependable
and I don't really feel
the need to get like a fancy new car.
And I imagine
if you're under pressure on your car loan,
it's probably like not that difficult
necessarily
to find an older car
that is somewhat reliable.
I don't know, you know,
the one thing though.
So I have a car, that I bought in 2015.
It runs, perfectly.
Well, I would not be surprised
if it continued like, no issues at all.
It doesn't have CarPlay integration.
Oh yeah.
The one difference between an older cars
and newer cars is that it's very nice.
Like having that know that that interface
where you have like,
got a little speaker or something.
Yeah.
But what it doesn't have is that like
really nice interface with the map.
Like, and I know that to minor,
but it's like, oh, do you have a map.
It has a really it has
it's a Subaru.
For those curious, and it's like,
you know,
it's like they're in-house to crappy map.
It's not the really nice like Google Maps
where it's, like,
really clear and it doesn't have turn
by turn navigation.
I know this sounds like kind of minor,
but it is very annoying.
And like when I am in a car
that has like a modern,
I have a little tangent here
when I am in a car
that has like a really nice interface
with,
a nice Google Maps or Apple Maps
and the Spotify integration.
It's very nice.
And apparently we've
taken into the dealer, they just cannot.
It is on.
Oh really? Yeah, it's on upgradable.
There's no for some reason
there is no way to put in a new dash.
Oh, sorry.
I thought you meant un upgradable
in terms of trading it in for.
No no no don't.
Upgradeable is like we cannot like this.
We could never install CarPlay
or whatever.
Yeah.
You know,
my husband and I rented one of those,
like, big fancy trucks, pickup trucks.
And I was amazed by the amenities
that are actually.
Yeah, including, like, the heated seats
I personalized heated, heavy heated what?
Yeah. That's fancy.
You know, it is very nice in the winter.
Heated seats.
We just talk about cars
for, yeah, maybe a while longer.
But the thing is, like,
even for a car like that, I just.
I cannot imagine spending like, $100,000
plus whatever the interest rate actually
is on something like that.
I remember that, meme from like,
2010 was like, no one will ever do.
Yeah, that was a big thing.
And the phone, it really was two things
that people will always find a way
to make a payment for the car
and the phone, I forget.
Right?
Which is why I think you have to look
at something structural that's shifted.
And I suspect
maybe it's the availability of,
you know, lots of older cars,
but just, just one last point.
It's I thought it was very interesting.
Ricardo was saying it's like there's no
obvious catalyst for classic cataclysms.
There's not obvious like,
oh, here is something we are
on the verge of consumer credit collapse.
But it is a story of
just like steadily building pressure,
right, such that if there
is some sort of spark or something,
there is a lot of stress, not,
you know, the resumption of student loans
after five years, the fact that the total
loan price of the car has gotten so high
relative to people's income, all of these
different things see you like
have all these upwards dresses on prices.
You have all of this reliance,
obviously, on accumulated
wealth,
most notably stock market and home equity.
So you have a lot of things
coming together
that are not necessarily disaster
or anything like that, but the, the,
the alignment of pressures isn't there
where things could potentially get bad.
Right? The consumer is much more fragile.
Yeah, than they used to be.
They might have been a few years ago.
Yeah. All right. Shall we leave it
there. Let's leave it there.
Okay.
