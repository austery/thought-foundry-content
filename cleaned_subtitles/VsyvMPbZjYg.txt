for the first time. It actually can be enjoyable and even more convenient to talk to an AI on the phone than talking to a human. I don't want to be mean to my people, the speech scientists, but historically, for some reason, voice did not attract the visionaries in machine learning. All the new hardware companies have voice at the heart of the product. All of these devices, they got rid of keyboards. They don't really have a a screen or an interface, and voice is going to be the main one.
>> Hi, I'm Matt from First Mark. Welcome to the Matt podcast. Voice AI is having a big moment. For years, the field was stuck in the uncanny valley, lagging well behind other AI modalities, robotic, slow, and frustrating. But in the last 18 months, everything has started to change. My guest today is Neil Zegidore, CEO of Gradium AI and formerly of Deep Mind and Meta. Neil is one of the very top AI researchers in the field and a key architect of the rapid evolution of voice AI towards real-time native audio intelligence. This conversation is a deep dive into everything you need to know about VoiceAI, where we explore many key concepts in a very accessible way and discuss plenty of fun stuff, including why Voice AI has so few experts, the massive challenge of building native audio models, and the rise of autonomous voice agents. Please enjoy this terrific and very educational conversation with Neil Ziggor.
>> Hey Neil, welcome.
>> Hey, thanks for having me. So a lot of people in the industry are saying that voice AI is having its big moment. There's certainly a lot of activity. There's a lot of funding rounds from your perspective. So you've been in this field for many years now at Deep Mind Meta now Gradium. Is voice indeed having its big moment or are we still early?
>> I think it's uh both having a big moment and we are still early. It's having a big moment because there is progress all around uh AI models and in voice for example the progress in latency naturalness accuracy have been really really huge in the past years in particular in the two uh last years and at the same time text models have evolved into what we now call agents which are not only text models but you know they can they can actually make actions and manipulate data access information and so on and so forth. And now when you when you bring both together, you can have voice interfaces that at the same time are going to solve complex problems. And so I think there is a moment now because for the first time it's actually can be enjoyable to and even more convenient to talk to an AI on the phone than talking to a human because you can call any time of the day or night and the interaction is uh is working pretty well and it sounds really nice and the latency is low and so on and so forth. So it's definitely having a moment because I think in a way it's now it can be used in much more use cases than it used to. But it's still early because it's still quite experimental. So anybody who who is using even the most advanced voice agents and compare that to the her movie from 12 years ago uh you know it's obvious the gap that is still remaining and there are so many topics that are completely unressed at the moment. In particular you know every time you you watch the voice agent demo uh just realize that it's someone talking to a phone in a quiet room. So the day where you will have someone shouting to a robot in the middle of a factory and having the robot understanding what's happening and who's talking to them that will be you know like we'll be there and we are not there at all.
>> Mhm. So we'll get into some of the technical details in a minute but um at a high level why uh has voice AI being I guess the most underdeveloped modality. There's been obviously extraordinary progress on text AI and then image AI and then video AI, but it seems that voice has been a little bit the the the poor parents in terms of uh progress. Why is that? I don't want to be mean to uh uh my people the speech scientists but historically for some reason uh voice did not attract the like the visionaries in in machine learning right so even if you looked at the dynamics in conferences uh if you proposed a new method like fundamental algorithm and you wanted it to be accepted in a prestigious venue you had to have an application either in computer vision like image classification or NLP if you did it in speech you will get rejected because it was like uh two speech and at the same time the the the prestige of speech conferences uh used to be much lower than that of computer vision or or NLP. So honestly I I don't really know why because when you look at the details the first big success of deep learning everybody knows the Alex net model in 2012 where for the first time you know you had a deep learning model uh outperforming every single alternative on image classification but actually the really first big success in deep learning was speech recognition with work from Joffrey Hinton himself.
>> Uh
>> and when was that?
>> It was in I think 2007 or 2008. So way way before uh
>> yes and so I think it's uh you know it was just not as prestigious and uh so it wouldn't attract uh a lot of people that could have made significant contributions I would say and uh then what happened and was very nice is there was kind of a convergence of algorithms around transformers and LLM so that now pretty much regardless of the task or modality you are looking at you're always looking at the same technology and there started to be much more progress also thanks to now the similarity between as different modalities because in particular what I contributed to with as my team was to take a lot of inspiration from successes in vision and uh and NLP and apply them directly to speech but it's still interesting because in a way um there are way fewer people who can train a competitive speech model than in text or in vision so I mean it's a good position to to be in because it's you know very few people have really gone into like the depth of of this topic
>> and uh and it's one that is very challenging because it's bringing ideally if you want to solve the problems you need to understand machine learning signal processing that is much more you know completely different literature around telecommunication audio compression and so on along with uh psychology and not like cognitive psychology but psychoacoustics how does the and hearing works, how does speech production works in humans, you know, so all of these when you bring them together, you can make competitive models, but it's it requires kind of a very wide scope of uh of expertise in very different domains.
>> Fascinating. To put it in numbers, how many would you say people there are in the world with that expertise? Are we talking about 100, 500, 10?
>> Between 10 and 100, no, I would say 50. I don't know. It's hard to say but uh yeah I think it's very few and really meaningful contributions that have pushed the field forward have been made by very small groups of people and I I think that's also what's nice. So AI I think in general is is is one field where individuals can have a disproportionate impact because you know the amount of things you can you can do by yourself. You have access to to compute and uh and data sets is huge and in voice in particular since the required compute is much lower and is that the same for data really a few individuals can make stuff that is completely uh you know just changing u applications at very large scales.
>> Great. So you mentioned uh her a minute ago which is the individual reference for any conversation about uh voice. What is the ultimate success in voice that the field is working towards? Is that super low latency expressiveness? Uh what what is what is great? So latency latency is already something that only makes sense if you are in a turnbased conversation because latency then the definition of latency is how much time there is between two turns. One of the thing we contributed uh doing is uh getting rid of speaker turns completely uh with what we call full duplex conversation. So the idea that it's always listening always speaking and when it's not speaking it's just that it's producing silence but you know it's always on and in that context there is no real latency anymore. So because the model is just basically can talk at any time and it can talk over you and you can talk over it and that makes the conversation really natural. And then naturalness it's not only these dynamics in terms of tempo you know like when the model can jump in the conversation when they should remain quiet there's this dynamics question and then there is emotion and so there is emotion in what the AI expresses it's emotion is uh natural but also appropriate that if you start feeling confident enough to start sharing about stuff that makes you unhappy or sad or feeling miserable it's not saying Oh, I'm so sorry for you. Let's talk about it. And uh it will also understand uh when you're getting upset, when you're getting confused and so on and so forth. This will make already uh voice AI in terms of interaction extremely natural and the as close as possible to human, which is basically what is one of the things we we see in the her movie, which I I hate mentioning as a reference because it's so overused. It's annoying.
>> Yeah. But at the same time, everybody understands, you know, the gap between where we are right now and and the movie. So that's I I think it's still a relevant one. And it's even interesting how relevant it still is despite the, you know, the fact that there's so much work around voice. But then there will be other questions about
>> how voice is integrated into our lives. So you know, there are paradigm in in in voice AI such as wake word detection. So you know when you use uh Google Home or Alexa whatever you know you have a wake word that is going to turn uh the speech to text on. So now let's say you want to to work with your assistant that is always listening to you. So in a way you would have something that is just running constantly without having even necessarily a wake word. So all of this I think is going to be both technical challenges and product challenges around where do they sit how are we interacting with them the link to the hardware as well. So I think what is a good sign for voice as a field as well is that in my perception all the new hardware companies have voice at the heart of the product. All the prototypes that we see whether it's it's glasses or pendants or you know like the new stuff that Johnny and Samman are working on voice is at the heart of the product and will be the main way of interacting. So all of these devices they got rid of keyboards. they don't really have a like a screen or an interface rather on you know and voice is going to be the one that is the main one.
>> What's your vision of the future? Where does voice fit in? Is that a voice and text? Is that primarily voice for certain use cases? And the you know there certainly an argument um that you'll hear a lot of people saying voice is great but like most of the time like I'm at the office like the last thing I want is like for people to hear my conversation and therefore I don't want to talk to a machine. So where does voice fit in um that vision of the future?
>> So for example, I used to think that one obvious application where voice was kind of irrelevant was coding because it's fundamentally you're not going to read code out loud, right? Yet now since coding is going more and more towards vibe coding which is natural language, it makes a lot of sense to do it by by speaking. And you know now people are developing products that allow you to you know dispatch orders to coding agents uh in a way that is much more efficient that if you had to type in each different window to each of them even prompting LLMs now is doing by voice is much more convenient rather than typing. I still agree that there is one part which is more social about what the offices environment will look like. I don't know maybe we will just also rethink uh the way we just structure office environments. What is sure is um now people have AI assistants that are almost colleagues, right? Uh I mean you talk to any software engineer the anthropomorphization of code code is I find it extremely funny. It's uh you know even the the the verb coding I mean it's going to be coding pretty soon. And so these people you know they will if it's more convenient to interact with their main uh tool through voice uh that will justify also rethinking office spaces I guess. So, so uh yeah, I think there will be work around that and we will naturally find them if if voice becomes the main way. I mean if it's more practical to interact with with AI through through voice.
>> Super interesting. Before we go further, let's talk about you uh a little bit and your journey and the company. So I mentioned deep mind and meta and now gradium and cut in the middle. Just like walk us through uh your life story and uh your work. So I studied in mathematics and u I started uh my career in with a short internship in quantitative finance.
>> Yeah.
>> And that was in Paris right?
>> Yes in Paris. And uh I was born and raised there. And what was interesting during my internship I had access to a Bloomberg you know terminal and so I will see the news uh like the constant news in in the below the screen. You know, I was thinking, what if I could have an algorithm that just read this news and take positions on the market faster than anyone because it was just able to analyze the news live. And I was looking, but I had no keywords about that, right? So I I literally Googled how can I analyze text automatically or whatever. And I found machine learning and I, you know, it was a epiphany. Decided to completely stop,
>> started studying again. My goal was to go back to finance with AI you know and machine learning but I got passionate about all the possibilities there was around uh so back then there were no LLMs and it was not really about generative AI it was about medical imaging text understanding uh a lot of things around uh audio speech recognition obviously and I looked for for an internship which was about unsupervised uh learning which was already pretty cool and I just wanted to do it and uh so I pretended that was passionate about language and u and I got the internship and then Yanluk opened Facebook Paris and was able to interview. So for the anecdote um I did my coding interview with Sumit Chintella who then invented PyTorch and now I think he's the CTO of thinking machines. Yep. And so I didn't know how to code because I I had only studied mathematics and so he asked me to implement C means basic algorithm and I asked if I could do it in mat lab because I didn't know I didn't even know Python I knew like very basics Python and he was kind enough to let me do my coding interview in mat lab and I got the job which when I think about it it's so cringe because oh my god thank you sumit but uh and yeah I did my PhD there it was very interesting was already on speech and I was spending half my time at Facebook and all my half my time at economy in Paris in a lab that was studying language acquisition in babies. In particular, the main observation on which the lab was built was that humans learn language from mostly two speakers, their parents with few hundreds to 1,000 hours overall in the first four years with huge variance between social backgrounds and without annotation, right? Because you learn to speak before you learn how to read. And that still makes us already pretty okay for conversation when when we are kids. And you know speech recognition back then was trained with already hundred of thousands of hours of annotated data. Now it's millions of hours annotated annotated data. So the topic was more around efficient learning which is interesting because it was 10 years ago but now is still as relevant as I think there was a a new company that raised a large ground recently to know make learning more efficient. So it's still as relevant as it used to.
>> Yep.
>> And then I joined Google. At that time it was interesting because uh so I joined working on speech in Google brain and there were almost nobody working on speech in Google brain.
>> It was not considered vibrant uh research topic.
>> It was it was like a product uh topic. A lot of people were saying oh but it solved you know. Oh no it's sold. It just works. So already back then.
>> Yeah.
>> And uh
>> what year was that?
>> Uh 2019.
>> 2019. And uh so I found someone to to work with me and uh we did like a lot of work around speech and then I got excited about a specific topic around compression audio compression. So was just out of patient I wanted to do like a new compression format that would not be MP3.
>> It's like a Silicon Valley right the HBO show.
>> Exactly. And uh and I wanted to do it with nor. The idea was that uh it
>> Yeah. it will be computationally more expensive to uh compress and and decompress the audio but then you could compress it much more efficiently
>> and that's something we worked on for Google meet and uh it was called soundstream that was the first what we call neural uh audio codec and I had no plan of doing genatic modeling back then really didn't care about that um but I was very lonely in a way and I just wanted I was trying to lure some people around me who are working in reinforcement learning. I wanted to get them to work on speech with me. I started a project around diarization, which is a task of you're listening to a conversation and you have to to tell who said what, which is probably the less sexy research topic out there. I'm sorry. I think it's fascinating, but you cannot get people excit I It's very hard to get people excited about
>> within speech, which is not very sexy. This is the less like Yeah. Like the monk project, you know, like very lonely and very Yeah. uh I was not very successful with that to to get people to work with me and I thought okay generative models uh the nice thing that if we generate speech people will listen to it and be oh that's cool my things you know my method has generated speech so honestly it was very opportunistic for me I thought that it will be a good way to get people to work uh with me and so we started a project and the idea was that we started to see success around language models so it was 2021 way before CH GPT but you know internally Finally at Google there were already quite a few projects that were successful around language models. And the idea was that just after the work we had done on the neural codec. So now if instead of using your codec for uh real-time communication but you just use it to compress audio now you have
>> you want to define quickly what a codec is.
>> Yeah. A codec is just a compression decompression. So you have an audio, right? And you want to send it over the network when you're having a Zoom meeting. And uh you're not going to send the uncompressed wave file because it's too heavy. So you're going to compress it in a much lighter file that you will send over the network and then the receiver can decompress it into back into audio. And the secret is based on a lot of science and knowledge around human hearing. we know what kind of information we can remove from audio so that it won't create a perceived degradation basically. So it's there is a lot of science around what specific information you can remove from from an audio that will make it almost as good for human as the original one despite the fact that you removed a lot of information which allows you to compress. And the main idea was that instead of using hardcoded rules to do that, we would learn from data what are the transformations that allow to compress audio while making it as transparent as possible for for the human ears basically.
>> And so now we had this way of compressing extremely efficiently much more than MP3 or opus an audio. And in a way you could consider that it was so compressed that it was almost like text. And so we just simple thing we did is just train LLM to predict this compressed studio instead of predicting text. And then you could do is the exact same thing you can do with text. You could prompt. So I take Swiss audio compress it. I pass it to LM and I let it predict the next compressed audio and realized we had in one week we had invented instant voice cloning. So we could replicate any voice with a few second of audio. And yes, this became extremely successful because it was all the advantages we had with LLMs, we could benefit. So LM are great at modeling long context. They scale very well. So if you want to have a large model, you just scale the small model. It sounds obvious like that, but for a lot of architectures, it's very difficult to go from a 100 million parameter to a billion parameter model. With transformers and LLMs, it's obvious. And um I could go into more details, but in
>> what was that project called?
>> ALM. and uh and then it gave music and then it gave notebookm that were the automated podcast and that became the standard framework for audio generation. There were two families that were kind of fighting at one during some time it was diffusion uh models which I think what 11 labs was based on early on and we were the audio language model family. I think today virtually everything is audio language models because since they are auto reggressive so they they run in a in a streaming fashion they are naturally compatible with real-time inference which is kind of the main topic around voice right now and so everybody is using uh this technology today and yeah so it was a a very uh very successful and uh and extremely easy to apply to new tasks. So, you know, we did it on speech first and so then we we collected a data set of piano performances and then we had a model for piano and then we did more general music and then we could do pretty much um anything. Uh it's even used by a nonprofit uh lab working on human uh sorry animal
>> vocalizations to try to to decode the language of of animals called the Earth Species Project. So yeah, you can it's you know as flexible as LLM forex basically.
>> Amazing. Amazing. you played an incredibly uh important pioneering uh role in guess the current state of voice and then what was the next stop after that
>> at the time where there where uh Gemini started at at Google that's where that's when I I left so I wanted to to you know to create a small research environment that reminded me of the early days of fair or Google brain so very small team elite uh no distraction sorry to say that no product manager or no you know like just just research scientists, no emails like just just you know uh locked in a room with the machines and uh focused on on science and in particular what the goal for me was really to keep working on fundamental research and keep pushing the field forward and training students and so on because I felt very grateful to have been able to do uh research in such an open environment. It was also obvious for me that uh and for this I think I agree 100% with Yan Lukan the fact that what made AI dynamic and get from imaget in 2012 to where we are right now today is open research that's uh because it's kind of a worldwide collaboration and everybody benefits from the progress of everyone. So that's for for me it was important for the field itself to to keep this going and so we decided to create a nonprofit with the help of of Erishad. So for the anecdote the code name was sphere because that's the name of the restaurant where we discuss the project and we then understood that we could never trademark the name sphere obviously. So we just asked a ch GPT for a sphere in a few languages and sphere in Japanese in isqai
>> and there was AI in it. So like okay that's the name of the lab now and uh so that's how we created QAI. The first person I I reached out to is Alex dece who is also now co-ounder of of gradium is our chief science officer because we had done our PhD together at Facebook and then when I joined Google we kind of kind of became rivals because uh you know we are working on the same stuff at the same time and every time we'll meet one another we'll just not talk about anything because like what are you working on? Oh, nothing. Okay. And and uh and yeah, and so uh so yeah, we had a small team but with big expertise in speech and we decided to to work on the stuff that again it was opportunistic decision that uh we made. So I looked at, you know, the kind of stuff we could do around voice and for a lab, okay, we had 1,000 GPUs that seemed a lot in 2023. It was still already at least one order of magnitude lower than biggest labs. So we wanted a project where we could do a difference despite the fact that we were four for people. It shouldn't need too much compute and it should be very innovative so that you know just by being smart about what we did we could make a difference. And so we we focused on conversational AI and real-time conversation because I had seen from the inside at Google that nobody's was daring to touch this topic because it was so challenging, you know, and it really seemed extremely far to be able to to cast the task of dialogue into an LM, right? People were just working on like TTS and speech to text. Uh the interactive stuff was really not there yet. So we thought, okay, we're going to work on it and we're going to make it full duplex. Might as well do something really, really innovative. What we didn't know at the time is that OpenAI was already working on a speechtospech conversation for a while. Uh but in 6 months, we have a team of core team of four people and then six, we were able to ship a model train from scratch called Mushi that is still to this day only full duplex model. Uh you can talk to it. It's a bit dumb because it's archaic in terms of intelligence, you know, but the latency is still one year and a half after it's still the best in the world by far.
>> Mhm.
>> And I think what was very interesting was that a very small team could do make such a difference because then we shipped the first speech to speech translation system and then streaming speech to text and then streaming text to speech and our models have been used across all industry. Uh we are always proud to hear that a lot of big companies are using it, a lot of small companies are using it. Maya and M demo from Sesame was built around our open source models. So I think what I really like about voice and what makes Gradium uh a project I I deeply believe in is it's one of the modalities in AI where a very small team can make a difference. You don't I don't really see benefits from having extremely large organization with a lot of people and resources because you don't need that many resources. you know, you're not you don't need 10,000 GPUs to train a a speech model. You don't need 1,000 people. The ability to go fast, iterate fast um with the right people to me is far superior to the advantage of having a big uh organization.
>> And then let's talk about Gradium. So, Gradium is a commercial spin-off.
>> Yes. So, as I said, our open source models were very successful. They are still downloaded uh millions of times a month. And we started having uh companies reaching out from all sizes, small, very large. They saw the potential. Sometimes it was a bit weird because I was talking to uh people leading extremely large teams and I was explaining how I could train by myself uh streaming speech to text that was uh better than all alternatives. There was something we were doing very well but at the same time our open source models remain limited. They were fundamentally prototypes for us. They were not even the actual contribution for us. The contribution was the invention and the related research publication. For us, it was kind of like a artifact accompanying the paper these models. But uh people wanted such models to be multilingual, higher quality, you know, all the things that make an actual product. And so we considered kind of outsourcing this part, you know, working with another team that will lead the product and so on. And honestly after a few interactions I realized nobody could carry such a project except us.
>> Nobody can believe in something if they have not uh developed it from scratch. We were in conversations with uh companies that wanted to create partnerships to improve uh our open source models and I would look at the specifications they wanted and I realized it's something we could do in a few days and they had been struggling for months. So yeah, I mean it seems that we are also the best team to to do that. And from a personal point of view, you know, I was kind of addict to academic prestige. Uh having best paper awards, all this stuff, it was always nice, but it was never enough. Every time I did a paper, I was happy for like two hours and then I was already thinking about the next version. And at the same time it felt a bit weird eventually that I could not imagine that at the end of my career I would have worked on something so applied and so close to actual real life applications and not doing them uh myself you know not contributing to them directly. So I think in the end even in terms of achievement academic success is one thing but nothing is near in terms of impact to the fact of having people using your models for the the real world and in a way I think it's it's something that is uh it's kind of generalized now in the industry and was also something that made me think is I looked at all the people I respected the most. The main one being to me a living legend Aon von art from Google deep mind all these guys they they they were making so nice contributions scientifically and then they decided to focus on products and I think it's I want to think it's because they also realize that academic prestige is one thing but making a real impact is having your models being used in the real world and so for me it's it's the ultimate uh impact we can have we still do science um in particular cutai keeps doing open source and open science and so on. For me the upside about it is mostly to be able to train the next generation of AI researchers and keep the field alive as I said because I think it's to have a healthy and vibrant AI field you need to have scientific dissemination so scientific exchange between institutions
>> and there also you know like the Chinese lab I making a remarkable work and they kind of are forcing everyone to stay open to some extent because otherwise it also hurts the ego I think of of the people who are in the lab that don't publish. That was also something where I was very opportunistic about. So my strategy was like if we publish in a world where the others don't publish uh they will get so pissed uh you know of us claiming all the inventions that it will make them join us eventually. And it's true that you know it's kind of hard because some people they they want to be in the in the place that is the cool place where the cool stuff happens. It's not only about composition and so on. It's uh now it's it's I would say everybody working in AI and doing a good job in AI is going to get good economic outcomes. So then what can you you know glory is also very important and it can be scientific or it can be just being proud that you are making the best products but I think it's also an important part important part. Yeah.
>> Great. Now, Gradium is an actual company that was launched a few months ago and obviously you are a new entrance in the field of AI where there's a tremendous amount of competition. So, I think for for voice in particular like the obvious question is why has OpenAI or Google or MEA not already won Voice AI? And I think you probably alluded to some of the reasons up front, but why why is that? Why why can a small company hope to become the leader?
>> So one thing I I mentioned was u if you have the right team it can be extremely small and still make a significant impact. Other uh arguments I think is one is focus. So for example, if you look at large multimodel models, right? Like these generic models that understand images and can generate text and can produce code and so on. You have uh like a limited budget which is a number of parameters and data you're going to fit to your model. When you want to add speech to them, you're fighting with coding and uh image understanding and so on. So you are playing with a lot of trade-offs that are irrelevant to the task that you want to to solve. And at the same time these models are so large they cannot run at scale because they will just make everyone lose money in the process. The only uh format that makes sense for speech models to run at scale is to be extremely compact which also means that the training resources you need to train them are much smaller than what you need in a to train other kind of model. So the resources are not as challenging as for text models. I think also another aspect is uh in a way not trying to just make a conversational product. So really making building blocks so that people can build the product. So we could make the gradium conversational assistant and think a lot about its capabilities and what it can do and what it cannot do and what will be the use cases for people and so on and hope that uh like the voice mode of open AI it's used for this task and this task and so on. But it's impossible to cover everything with that. And so now if we want to cover uh NPCs uh fake sport commentors in in video game and a language learning app and an annoying character in a cartoon and the customer uh center agent and so on, then we just make the building blocks. And this again is it's not really I think in the DNA of big companies to do this kind of very specific models that are targeted towards developers uh rather than trying to solve a lot of things at the same time.
>> And then there's an additional aspect to this which is that voice can also and should be pretty often on device versus uh an API call to the cloud. Is that is that fair? I think what is very ch very challenging right now is if you want to have the full intelligence on device like the like your full conversational AI on device. Honestly I would say at this point if you want such a model to be useful we are not there yet right you can have something that can chit chat a bit and it will be decent or we also have shipped models on device but they are much more constrained in terms of applications. So for example, we we started a year ago with a ondevice speech to speech translation which is something that makes a lot of sense because when you're traveling maybe you know you don't have a data plan that is uh going in every country. So it makes a sense to have something that works on your phone if you want to order at a restaurant or something like that. I think it's a particularly adapted use case. But now we also uh we released two weeks ago a model called Pocket TTS that not only is on device but CPU only. So uh there are already mods for AAA video games uh where the NPCs can be powered through these voice models and now you unlock a completely new kind of of applications because ondevice models allow to do very large scale personalized content that will be uh economically and not realistic with an API. So again these kind of things is uh you know if you want to make meaningful progress in that direction making small models in voice is much more difficult than making large models invoice. So keeping the quality while reducing the size of the model that's where the big challenge is and our CPU model in terms of algorithm it's like the cutting edge of what we know you know it's really the latest generation of everything we've been doing so far. So just a few days ago there was this big announcement by Alibaba/quen that they were open sourcing the Quen 3 TTS family for voice design clone and generation. How do you think about uh opensource uh in your world as Gradium? Is that a friend? Is that a foe? So if you if you read the paper you will find our our names uh in several pages. It's mostly uh inspired from uh the Mushi architecture like pretty much every uh model right now even the VTA model that was released by Mistral tweaks ago is also uh based on on our framework. I think that's really interesting because this proves that uh uh there are things that we you know that we do right because everybody is building on them. At the same time, I would say it's quite an advantage because I would say not there are two kinds of p research papers. There are research papers that are meant to be as explicit and reproducible as possible which is what we try to do when we do one. And there are some that are more about I would say marketing in the sense that they are mostly focused on the results and the performance rather than explaining the underlying mechanism and the data and so on and so forth. The nice thing of build people building around the frameworks we introduce is that even when they don't give details we can infer the details. So in a way in a competitive landscape I think it's a it's quite an advantage because in a way it would be more challenging if people were transitioning to something completely different from what we've been doing because you know then we would could not infer anything from when reading their papers. Now all of this is very familiar when we read those and at the same time we have all the issues that people are facing. We have been facing them for a while and so we have already workarounds and new versions and so on. Open source at cutout that's like the the end goal of the lab at gradium that's not the end goal of the lab. The end goal of lab is to make uh of the companies to make competitive products that outperform every alternatives. But open source is I think it's a good way of uh allowing developers to prototype stuff understanding what people expect what they want. You know it's also a way to train talent.
>> Mh.
>> A few days ago we released the hibiki zero. So that's hibiki was our speechtospech translation system. Now it's a new algorithm uh that makes it even lower latency, better voice cloning, multilingual and so on and so forth. And the PhD student who who was working on that project at Qoutai is joining Gradium for a few months to do visiting PhD and then he will start his PhD again. So I think there are very healthy relations between open source and proource that can be done. At the same time I u I don't think it's it hurts any defensibility quite the opposite honestly
>> and uh and so I think it's um it's also for talent it's very attractive because people when they join us they know that they can work on really competitive products but at the same time they can keep sharing uh models and more exploratory research and do really frontier stuff and I think if we want to stay uh at the cutting edge We should be a product company but also be a frontier lab and being a frontier lab you need to do fundamental research too.
>> Y to
>> what's the gap between uh open source and closed source in voice obviously in text there is like this cat and mouse game and the it seems that the commercial labs are constantly like pretty far ahead of the open source. Is that the same thing in voice AI? So what is interesting in a in a in voice is now I think a high school student could make something that is decent but then what people want is the last mile and the last mile is extremely difficult and the last mile is pronouncing well all the difficult cases is having a latency that not only is low but is robust and almost zero downtime and um you know being able to clone voices regardless of accents and so on. all all these hard cases for me the only way to find the energy to solve them is because that's your business you know because uh otherwise if you look at benchmarks like the benchmarks for TTS it's a libri speech so it's it's books a lot of them from dstyfki so it's it's it's more about whether you are going to miss a i or a y in a in a Russian name or you know it doesn't evaluate can you pronounce phone numbers and email addresses and URLs and all this stuff. So, so when you optimize for the bench these benchmarks, you lose a lot of uh the actual real world cases. Yeah. So, I think the main difference is the incentive to do things really with the finest details only makes sense for when you want to be competitive in product. It's not only about the models, right? Uh the infrastructure to to run these models at scale is extremely important. I think particularly in a API uh business model your margins mostly depend from the efficiency of your inference and so in particular I'm very lucky to have in my team one of my co-ounders law who did several years in you know he did all this car in quantitative finance mostly at Jane Street and now we have more people coming from quantitative finance and these people they are really passionate about efficient inference that's their bread and butter you know uh because in financial like uh in high frequency trading that's kind that's the only way to exist and and the engineering challenges are really significant and I think a team in engineering as well and not just like training models makes a huge difference and where now if we're talking then about on device inference that's even more complex right if you want a model to run on all Android and iPhone and so on you know that's a big engineering challenge
>> you mentioned benchmarks a minute ago and that seems to A really interesting question for voice and video as well and images is how do you make a case that your technology is better than the next provider because some of it seems to be a little bit around vibes right like how you feel when you're on the receiving end of a voice AI. One things that is uh that is clear is that you can only trust human judgment. People have tried to make objective proxies of uh human judgment like that would be a neural network that listens to an audio and gives it a grade. Uh it sucks like so many people try and it works on their constrained setting and on real audio it doesn't work at all and completely breaks. So we don't trust anything about uh you know but our ears. So we do a lot of blind test internally. We do a lot of blind test externally. So we are working with human judgment constantly. So every single decision we make is based on human listening. We don't trust metrics at all. So it's fundamentally subjective experience the quality of audio. But there are some things that are going to be widely shared rather like the the pro the tone and the rhythm are natural or not. A lot of people would agree on that. Is a voice nice or not? Nobody agrees on that. And so then the only way for me to claim to have uh the best solution is to have the largest uh catalog and most diverse set of voices that people can pick because then you know it's the kind of what voice are people going to like this really depends on uh uh between people. I had faced that in the past when we did music at Google. So for the first time we made you know text to music. So you could type like uh death metal with Marima or whatever and you get death metal with MIMA and uh and so we put like some like a website online where people could do this stuff and at the same time we were already planning to do for the first time a LHF so reinforcement learning from human feedback on music
>> and so what we had designed is people could give a so there will be two generations every time and people could give a trophy. I had planned that because you know I wanted for the first time to have integrate humans in the loop of music generation because I think you know scientifically that will be uh really huge uh and what was interesting is that so we made a a paper about that called musicl and it was quite nice but the results were not extremely convincing and then what we did is that we just did judgements judgment ourselves so you know with people with my colleagues we took like I don't know 10 or 20 pairs of audio and each time we choose our preferred one and there was zero agreement between people. So there is no way uh you know like an algorithm is going to learn human preferences when there is so much subjectivity. So the only thing you can make is make it more steable for each user to be able to customize it because there is nothing that is going to you know please every user consistently. Mhm.
>> The obvious next question is if if nobody can agree on whether this model is better than that model, then uh aren't all the models more or less the same and therefore the entire voice AI model industry is sort of like commoditized all the models being u the same. I think then people talk about TTS already, right? Which is much more constrained than voice AI. So in text to speech I mean there are factual metrics about accuracy and latency and then there are more um subjective things around expressivity and so on but you can again you can really make a difference by making it more controllable more customizable and so on and so forth. So I don't think that it's clear that the best TTS the most controllable the most the most smart in terms of expression is in front of us. nothing is is close to it yet and then there is everything that is not TTS. Uh you look at transcription now again what what if a lot of people are are speaking. So I was talking about theization as the le least sexy problem ever. At the same time it's uh it's a extremely useful problem and you look at the error rates and they are very bad. I mean it's still just not working in difficult cases where you have a podcast with a lot of people talking at the same time just completely breaks. full duplex we know we did machine a year and a half ago still nobody has made it into a product that there are so many things that are just not existing today that I think the the communityization maybe it will happen someday but we are very very far from it honestly and the gap in uh you know there is already bridging the gap in quality and abilities you know to make that as powerful as human production of speech and understanding of speech in complex environments and so on and then Even if you reach this point, there will always be challenging about getting the same performance with smaller models because then again like a full duplex smart voice AI that can run on a on a gamer GPU or on a on an iPhone. Good luck, you know, like that's okay. Awesome. I'd love to spend a little bit of time on the technical aspects of Voice AI. So we we talked about some of them, alluded to others, but I think it'd be nice to bring everything together. So in terms of the fundamental innovation that you described around speechtoech models, c can you for us compare and contrast like the the old way which I believe is the cascade
>> uh versus this new generation of models. How does that
>> cascaded system which is the old way but is actually pretty new. So like the old way is without LM you know. you think about so we talk you know the old so the old way is like Alexa and so on it's
>> back two years ago back in the day two years ago
>> the old way is natural language understanding with parsing with very limited vocabularies and so on but the cascaded ID is you basically just take a LLM and and you wrap it into a speech input and speech output so you have like streaming transcription and streaming text to speech the nice thing about that is you can plug in LM and you can customize its behavior through its prompt like you would do with a text model. A main limitation is around first latency of the whole thing because you're running three model in a cascade and each of them is going to add to the overall latency of the interaction and uh by going through the bottleneck of text you lose what we call par linguistic information which is all the information we convey when we speak on top of what we say. to that uh emotional states irony lying is one you know like a lot you know it's uh you know a lot of information is conveyed that is not um that is not in what to say particular I I encourage people to to look at the every few years inter speech one of the main speech conferences organizes a par linguistic challenge with challenges that are more random every time like uh so li lying detection is one but then you have trying to recognize is the the origin of the parent of someone from them speaking or there was one about people are speaking while eating and you had to recognize what they are eating. So you know anyway when we speak there are a lot of information that come about us and this is lost through so what you're writing obviously is maybe not the most uh like relevant one but understanding in the customer care context understanding that you're getting lost or annoyed and so on it's extremely important to be able to recover the conversation into a good state. Sometimes it's obvious from the text like if if the AI says go to hell yeah probably they're upset. uh but sometimes it's not that that obvious in that kind of cues can be uh uh can be helpful and so that's the only way I mean one way to address all of that all together is piece to speech and full duplex on top of that addresses what I think today is the worst part of voice AI I hate it from the bottom of my heart it's turn taking in any introductory course to a conventional network or image classification there is always this analogy that that is made that you can make rule to tell whether an image is shot in the morning or night just based on colors, right? You can just look at colors values and make a handmade rule. But now if you want to recognize whether it's a cat or a dog, you cannot make rules that are recognize all the shapes of cats and dogs and all the angles and so on and so forth. So that's why we do machine learning, right? You just learn from the data when you cannot make the rules. With turn taking, we are back at the archaic era of handmade rules which is ridiculous. It's like you have an algorithm called the voice activity detection algorithm that just says whether it's silent or not and if it's silent more than xund of millconds and then this rule and this rule and this rule then it's an interruption but if this happened it's not an interruption and and so you have rules on top of rules on top of rules to decide whether the model should talk or not and that makes it so that I mean you know that everybody who's talking with cascaded systems right now is you need discipline when you talk to AI you need to adapt to its flow otherwise it's it gets lost and gets confused and interrupts and so on and this is extremely annoying mushy again people can can talk to it today it's not really powerful but the the quality of the interaction is unmatched in the sense that you can really take five seconds to think about what you're going to say and then talk and the model won't be lost it will just you know be extremely uh flexible
>> and and what we did is uh it was extremely simple thing. So we took like the audio language model instead of having it modeling one stream of tokens we called it multiream just two stream of tokens one for the user one for the AI and both can be active at the same time and there is no turn taking anymore and you just train it on stereo data people talking on the phone and you have like one person on the left channel and one on the right and your model models both at the same time and then you play the the role of left channel and the AI plays the ro the role of right channel and the model will learn how to handle a conversation like humans on the phone.
>> Mhm.
>> And so when we did the motion announcement particular there was a fun early demo that we did of at some point we trained the model on the fish data set. So, it's a phone conversation about uh that were recorded in the US in the late '9s and you could literally give a phone call to the late '9s and it will mention like Saddam Hussein and Jack Shiraak and talk about you know like a lot of political stuff from the it was very weird because you're talking to a guy say hey I'm both from Arizona and every time it's a new guy and you can talk about whatever and they tell you about their job and so on. So it's a kind of paranormal experience. Very fun. I think eventually it's impossible to think that we will stick to turn taking in the future. So obviously for us like the the end goal is multiplex. That's uh was always our motivation. At the moment what we do is cascaded systems because that's where the market is right now. It's people they are still iterating a lot on the underlying text models that they want to to use on the uh tool use and so on and so there is so much progress on the text side. One drawback of speechtospech models is that since everything is integrated when you go from a text model to the speechtospech model you need to fine tune it on speech data. So now it's the cost to switch the underlying text model is extremely high because you will need to refine tune everything from scratch. People want something that is modular plug and play. What will solve everything is providing the same flexibility as like cascaded system so that you can change the back end on demand basically and you get the same customizability and customization that you have with text models but with the full duplex and that's this this I think is going to be a convincing solution to all the current limitations.
>> So that's the frontier of voice AI. one of the frontiers I would say. Yeah. Again, ones where I would say a frontier is I could like bet to every single speech team in the world that they don't solve it in the next year or so. It's a robot in the middle in the factory and there is a lot of noise from machines and you have a lot of people talking to the robot and the robot has to figure out what the hell is going on. This uh I can you know I can I can sign that it's uh this is extremely challenging. If
>> if I had to pick the worst topic we work, I mean the ones that will be the most challenging, I think that will be this one. Even more than full duplex much, you know, much more difficult, I think.
>> And what happens behind the scenes when you have that noisy environment? Like what what does the model actually do? And how do you solve that problem? Like if you're calling a receptionist in a restaurant and like he or she picks up and there's super light in the back, how do you solve that problem? One thing that is u really important is to have uh several uh microphones. So we do we have two ears and it's extremely useful because that's allow us for example to localize an audio source. So the reason the why the reason why we can localize where sound come from because we have a small time difference between the time when it arrives in this year and this year. So if it arrives here before my brain will understand it will come this and you get like anger and then the acceleration of the face gives you the other dimension and so that's how you can locate in 3D. So having the ability of of doing this specialization understanding you know where the sources are coming from and which one is saying what and so on. Again it's it's both a hardware and software issue. Creating training data for that is extremely challenging. Honestly the level of robustness that we have as humans on that is uh exist extremely high also you know we are all lipreing we don't know that we are doing it but everybody is lip reading all the time that helps understanding a lot
>> u in noisy environments in particular we do it unconsciously but we all do it I think interactions on the phone are quite okay because you know the mouth is close to the phone and the phone can do a lot of work to enhance the quality but now you know people want to have a robot that is uh that can even a static robot that is just in in a room and you want to shout to it from your living room. It's called farfield speech recognition. It's it's really broken. Every every company who has made these home assistants know how difficult it is to have them work in in environments where there are several people. The reason I say I think it's one of the biggest challenge is in TTS we see a lot of progress for this kind of hard understanding problem. I hear people seeing the exact same stuff as they did 10 years ago. Like there was zero progress.
>> You mentioned data a second ago. How does that work for voice AI and how does that compare to text AI? Obviously text AI the LLMs are training on the whole internet but presumably there's a lot less audio and speech data to train on. How does that work? So if you do the math basically like training on a few trillions of tokens which is what you will do for you know like a basic text model that will amount to hundred of millions of hours of speech or something like that which is kind of amounts that are very hard to to get. I think this is it's a very interesting question that comes up in a lot of discussions and everybody has their theories in particular one impact uh one let's say one attribute of speech data was that if you train a conversational model on speech data is going to be much less intelligent than a model trained on text and I think it's because when you listen to speech data it's u the density of information is is much lower than you will have in text so you don't have Wikipedia like uh you know in speech data you don't have stack overflow reit and so on getting your model to learn about the world from speech I think is a terrible idea. I think you should start I mean you know we have text model. So what we did for mach we started from the text model and then we we we we we took this test model and and and trained it on speech while trying to prevent as much as possible a loss of intelligence. So all the time we will recmp compute the text metrics and they will degrade but we are trying you know like to keep it a bit contained but indeed the quality of uh of speech data extremely variable honestly I think we are training on way too much data so far we train on 7 million hours of speech it's ridiculous I mean we we could probably do that with 10,000 hours if we had the right method we didn't care because we had the data so like yeah screw it we just train on that which is great to capture all the very specific idiosyncrasies in voice the French accent like the things that make a voice unique. So for the diversity of voice, the amount of data is extremely useful. But at the same time, you could think okay if my model is intelligent as a text model, it could learn dynamics of conversation from a few thousands or dozens of thousand hours of data and not millions of hours of of data. That's one source of data. The largest volume is just you know unstructured conversation like publicly available audio books and this kind of stuff. And then you get towards more uh specific data that you make for your applications. For example, for TTS, you want to have uh expressive data of high quality. You don't want to have something that is recorded with uh arbitrary conditions. You want really studio recording, very low level of noise, u professional or semi-professional actors. And then there is what what kind of text do do you give them to read? And so I it's a very also interesting problem because so if you want to generate hundreds of thousand of hours of of scripts for voice actors, it's not that easy. I mean you cannot ask Clo or JPT write 100,000 hours of scripts and make them as diverse as possible. So it doesn't work. It's going just to be in a loop and and and collapse on a few topics. You know, even if you ask for phone numbers, they are not really random number generators. They will produce eventually like always the same phone numbers. So, Alex and my team spent a lot of time on making very complex machines for script generation with like a taxonomy of all possible topics and subtopics and sub subtopics and sub subtopics and sampling constantly. And every time we generate a phone number, it generated with an actual random number generator so that we actually cover the whole scope of phone number. So I think it's a very interesting problem. It's painful. It's annoying. It's really about details. And I love that because I think that's always where we can differentiate. It's just because we always as a gamer say we tank we tank the the painful stuff. And this pays off a lot because as I said in terms of computational resources, we don't need as much as to train largeing models or video models. But for speech, it's not really about the volume of data, but having high quality data is extremely useful and very important. And the accuracy, for example, of annotations, it's paramount. And it's a lot of human labor to be able to annotate precisely.
>> There is a labeling aspect to do this.
>> Yes. And the labeling aspect, it's interesting because automatic annotation works very well. And where humans are useful is really for the few mistakes that the best automatic annotations will do right now. And uh and so the only way to make it worth the time of humans is if they have perfect annotation. If they have slightly imperfect annotation, not really worth it.
>> How does it work if you want to add a new language especially uh not to pick on any but like I don't know u like Africans like something where there's less data on the internet presumably. Do do you have to hire actors to you know and create scripts specifically for them? How does it work?
>> What is interesting is that we see uh transfer between languages in particular languages from the same family. For example, with Hibiki Zero that we released last week. So it was trained on 50,000 hours or maybe 100,000 hours for for example Portuguese and Spanish. And then to do Italian translation to English, 1,000 hours was enough. I would say for languages that belong to a completely different family that's more challenging. What is nice is that fundamentally the whole pipeline is the same. The whole uh right now we have been focusing on a few languages to find the recipe that works and then then it can be uh applied to to most languages. Uh what is very difficult is uh unwritten languages. to languages that don't have an official writing system.
>> That's uh a lot of dialects where people are mixing languages and putting like a bit of French and then a bit of creole and then a bit of something else and so on. This is very challenging because getting data is difficult. Getting annotated data is even more difficult because you have much fewer annotators that can do that. But it's uh these ones are are the most uh challenging I would say
>> but it has been a challenge for for a long time and uh and there are a lot of projects around around collecting data in such language. Interestingly there is one u so for example the the content that you can find in the most languages is the Bible and so like the main source for uh like the most widely available content in the world in the Bible in all languages because a lot of people spend time into translating it and so on. So that's a very valuable source of data. Obviously you won't have a mention of modern vocabulary in it.
>> And what about a hardware? So you you mentioned earlier this is not a big hardware GPU play compared to bigms. Is that is that correct?
>> If you want to have voice models to run at scale and make sense from a uh you know in terms of economics you need to have this model compact. Anyway, if you think about having NPCs in a game where people are going to pay, I don't know, 70 bucks or 90 bucks or whatever for a game and then they want to talk to to it 3 hours a day because it's a very good game. So, you spend a lot of time on it. You can if you have a large model, it's just impossible. Not only doesn't fit on the GPU, but even through APIs, it just wouldn't make sense economically. So, fundamentally, I think these models need to be small, but sometimes they require access to large model because they're solving a complex task. I'm quite state in a way stating the obvious but selective and adaptive compute usage based on the context and the difficulty of the task at hand. The task being as precise as like the next few words can I just answer like that because some somebody say hey and I just say hey they ask for like the next flight to SF and I have to look up on internet to find the the time. So being very selective about when to compute to use compute I think that's that's the only way to for all of it to make sense uh economically.
>> Let's talk a little bit about the product and business aspect of Voice AI. You you mentioned that you were building a model company but also a product company. What is a product in in Voice AI? And the two things I'm thinking of are like one cloning uh and then agents. That's the two thing that people are talking about a lot. Take whichever one you want.
>> Yeah. So I think for this one um so for us the product is the underlying models right because what we see is that uh people are building voice agents. So voice agents uh it sounds I think a lot like a a business agent like a customer care agent or something like that. But an NPC in a way is an agent right because uh they have a voice interface they have a underlying text model. Eventually in video games they will be able to do function calling to launch a quest to decide that you solved something or to to to control an action and so on and so forth. What we focus on is providing uh the best technology to the people who want to build the agent. So we don't build agents ourselves. We really want to focus on the quality of the model because that's our specialty. That's where our talent is and at the same time I think it will be a bit unrealistic unrealistic to think that we can address all the needs of the market with our agents because again the I think what is very exciting is when we look at our customers it's every time there is a new one it's completely unpredictable what it will be about and it's about uh learning and customer care and video games and media and personalized uh press and it's so wide that we that we'd rather you know just make it easy for people to build voice agents and provide them with a reliable models infrastructure and that also works pretty well because in terms of of staff we are less than 15 employees today at Gradium when we partner with a company that deploys voice agents in banks or hospitals or different kind of businesses it requires a lot of what we could call today a forward deployment engineer. So there is a lot of staff human labor that is involved for these deployments into various complex systems and infrastructures and we can just focus on the model. So that also allows us to remain pretty small and really focus on on the science and the engineering
>> and uh voice cloning is that a is that a use case? Actually with at Gradium we have the best of of the of the industry and the best means not only replicating like the specific characteristic of someone but I mean also the accent some unusual recording condition and so in a lot of context for example if you want to create a vintage sounding character with old radio effects and it's something that we do pretty well. If you want to have a robot voice we can do that pretty well as well. If you want to have any kind of accent or speaking style like posh or more, you know, laidback or more urban, any kind of social aspects of an individual aspect of voice is something that we uh that we replicate pretty well. I think what is interesting is that voice learning in itself where I see the most potential is about creative creating interactive experiences around uh licenses. I tried to pitch for example you know who wants to be a millionaire uh there is a video game and the questions can be generated on the flight you would like the host to the voice of the host to on them all the time
>> so this one makes a lot of sense with cloning a specific voice because you want to replicate the voice of a character of a person of a athlete of a K-pop star whatever I don't know you know any kind of experience where people want to engage with a voice that they know but they want to go for an iterative experience then in a lot of cases for example in customer care people don't want a specific voice they want a voice with specific characteristics and that is nice for the use case. And so typically they clone the voice of a colleague that has a good voice. For these customers, I think the solution that makes the most sense is not cloning, it's voice design. So being able to to create voices from a natural language description and having your voice generation being really faithful to the prompt so that you can it's really worth iterating on it because there are a few solutions that exist today around voice design but as far as I know they are not very popular and people still still stick to the existing voice catalog because they cannot steer it precisely enough.
>> Yeah. But when this works, this will allow uh people to design the voices that they want for their use case, which I think is very interesting. Even though sometimes I'm a bit surprised because we have some customers, they just take a random stock voice from our catalog, which is one of ours like me or my colleague, and they don't care. And like I try to p them like let's design a voice together, make let's make a voice that represents your brand. But some people like no, it's fine. It's
>> fascinating. Or maybe you just have such a great voice that that's what the market wants. inevitable question around privacy and then deep fakes. Uh obviously in a context where one can clone somebody else's voice pretty easily. What does that mean and how do you protect all of us?
>> So first thing I want to say what are marking is a scam. I'm sorry I have to say it just doesn't work. Uh I worked on it.
>> Uh we have an appendix in the Mushi paper around how we could break so easily any watermarking that was supposed to be state. So people should not rely on that. Also water marking who verify the watermark right uh you will need a platform to do the verification and remove the audio but if someone in
>> explain what watermarking is in the context of audio yeah in audio that's the idea of of either finding a way to so when you generate an audio you put a hidden stamp in it like you would do in an image but now it's in audio so you cannot hear it but it makes it very recognizable that it not only it's fake but it's fake from this specific model
>> and also there is defect detection which is just recognizing get that audio is synthetic even if there is no water mark in it just telling true from fake these are very difficult to do unfortunately you know if you get a phone call from a scammer unless you have inside your phone the automatic detection it's useless right you cannot put upload it to a website that says it's true or fake honestly I would say at this point I don't know who has their grandma who lost their credit card and at the airport and it's $1,000 today because it's always a story I hear. It's probably not the case if you if someone gives you a phone call. So I would say just um in that context honestly I think there is nothing as safe as just acting asking personal questions that only the person that they pretend to be could answer.
>> So you think it's going to be a fact of life and therefore we need all to be just more vigilant.
>> Yeah. I mean you know it was already this the case with uh with emails right? And uh and people just need to be much more vigilant and probably will find ways to have authentification for example on the other phone side that it's actual person that is calling and so on and so forth.
>> But on the on the privacy front if I if I clone my voice with Gradium then you keep control of it.
>> Only you can use it. You need to own to own it but nobody will be able to uh uh to use it.
>> Yeah. And so it's only for your your own usage. And I think what eventually we could also do which was done before is allow people if they want to opt in uh to share their voice with the community so that they can also get you know like financial compensation if their voice is used by uh by other users. Okay. So I think this one is um this one is is is you know it's has a lot of value because it's it's a good way of sourcing a lot of voices eventually again if we omit the case of replicating familiar voices from licenses or existing people who who give their voice knowingly to create specific content. I think voice design is going to, you know, just remove this issue because then again people typically are going to clone the voice of someone but what they wanted is someone from a specific gender, specific demographics, age, accent and so on and so they could just fill this information and get a few propositions or voices that will fit their their need and that will remove the need for for for voice cloning.
>> Yeah. So as we get towards the end of this conversation just like a few sort of quick ones. one there seems to be an emerging discussion about the intersection between voice and screens or image. Is that something that you focus on?
>> There are several things in particular. So if you want to do uh speech understanding having access to the video can help a lot again for theization. For example, if you're filming like if you're listening presidential debates with several candidates, it's awful to understand. If you watch, you can see who is speaking at at each time and so on. So audio visual understanding is much stronger than audio understanding in itself. I think now also what is interesting is uh so we see that in a video generation like with V3 from Google now there is native audio that is uh included and that's why I think it's a for video generation I think the most natural thing is integration of video and audio. I don't think it really makes sense to do video to audio generation separately because typically the data exists as a multimodel signal right when you have a video you have the audio track as well so you might as well just exploit both to train your models so however now so for example we released for the Valentine's Day a small app called bridger clone now if I put my face in to you know like in photo I put to video I say make a video it's going to make up a voice that it thinks sound like me based on my appearance, my age and so on.
>> Where do people find that? So it's it's uh
>> it's called bridge clone.app
>> bridger clone like bridgetone like there's a plan word.
>> Exactly.
>> bridger clone.app.
>> Yeah. Okay.
>> And so what it allows you to do is now you can clone your voice. you can record a small a short uh love message and now you get a video of you in your voice, you know, and and this again I think that's that's why it's useful to have a a voice that is treated as kind of a separate component because now you can have much more control on the actual voice of the of the virtual character rather than you know just having a likely voice that sounds like it could be yours.
>> Yep. Okay. So we talked about cloning. Obviously cloning is uh just one of the many apps like ultimately just to play it back and drive it home. you provide building blocks and models to create all sorts of different products uh based on voice whether that's you know customer service use case or like any kind of like interaction translation like all sorts of
>> and what is interesting is u so at QA in two years we were able to do uh conversation uh translation TTS speech to text always competing with much bigger and much more mature teams it's still the same at Gradium and one of the big strengths is that we have kind of this fundamental framework for the generation around audio language models and it's extremely flexible. So I think one of our strengths as well is our ability to do like a new task and when people come up with new needs whether it's about annotating various stuff or generating various stuff all of this can be cast pretty easily in in our framework. Then if we see that there is huge demand for uh speed separation, it's pretty easy for us to do it for uh voice transformation for accent transformation whatever you know it's uh that's also why we are always interacting with the developers to understand what they want. We're also now giving access to alpha models that can do, you know, stuff that are still experimental but are world premieres and u and yeah, I think it's that's something I'm pretty excited because we can be much more creative than just speech to text and TTS. Obviously these are kind of the master tasks where we want to be the best in the world because that's where most of the opportunities are but at the same time we can do a lot of fun stuff that is completely uh orthogonal to to that in particular around transformation audio effects uh and so on. I think that can be there a lot of things to that can be very cool.
>> Great. And last uh theme or or or question, you building this company out of Paris. Obviously, you're building the company very much in a global way and you have multiple customers in in different geographies, including very much the US. We recording this today, New York. Uh you're flying out to San Francisco in a few hours. any thoughts on the current state uh of the French AI scene and the uh European I guess AI scene? you know, there's always this fun back and forth, you know, seen from the US combination of like occasionally admiration pretty often mockery and the fact that the Macron or whoever runs his social account um sort of misfired the other day by saying that he was going to allocate 30 million euros to AI when in reality meant specific program to attract a few academics to to to France. But um so what on the ground there what is your sense of the current state and the strengths and weaknesses of the
>> lot of things to say about that. I was born and raised in Paris. I did all my career there. Uh Facebook arrived when I started my PhD and then Google brain moved to Paris and Google did mind afterwards. I'm what we can call terminally online in the sense that I love the very mean memes against Europe. So this guy I don't remember his name. It's like a fake Swedish name. And he keeps posting about how, you know, he has after only 20 meetings, he has contributed a€ 10,000 check for and it's a compliance first company and everything, you know. But I love it. It's very mean. Honestly, I love it because it's very mean. I'm like I love when people have so much time to spend just to be mean. I mean, I think it's it's quite uh you know, I respect that. But uh uh at the same time it's so far from uh from reality. So you know uh French AI and European AI. So European AI is mostly French to be fair. There's also Germany but a lot of it is in France
>> and before French companies as there was French talent in American companies. So again a lot of the current audio generative models of Google a global company obviously were developed between Paris and Zurich actually most of it lama was started in Paris. Dino which is the uh most groundbreaking vision work from Facebook was developed in Paris. A lot of things have been developed in Paris that are not seen as Parisian because they were made in in American companies. And now I think the like the field in Paris is like the talent is so dense and the people are extremely strong and extremely committed and the best you know signal that that proves it is we used to have Facebook and and Google in Paris now there is openai there is entropic there is cohhere pretty much everybody is opening in an AB lab in Paris and the reason why they do is for the talent. So I think we have everything in France to to develop uh global companies in particular, you know, in AI, which is an economy really built around talent. That's a perfect uh uh a perfect deal for for it. Also, as a French uh as a French guy, I really don't want us to to screw it up, you know, in France because
>> in a way, you know, when you see like the the most successful French companies, it's a it's luxury or kind of stuff. And so yeah, I really want AI to be uh you know that's a field where France can make a big difference and that can become one of the most biggest driver in in the European economy. If it doesn't work then Europe will really have to look itself in the mirror and be like how could we screw it up with so many strong people because you know the people are here
>> and you know capital we we can get capital in in in in Europe as well. I think all all the conditions are are there for it to be competitive. In a way, the more people are mocking Europe, the more it can make the people who mock overconfident about themselves and everyone who is overconfident eventually get displaced by the underdog. So, you know, I I mean people should always uh you know like when I when I was the 996 uh like laring on on Twitter, it's it's ridiculous like people coding at the gym like what the like code and then go to the gym. you're not doing a good gym and you're not doing good code. So you're just it's just pretending. So I think we don't have a culture of pretending and that's whole Europe from the most western to the most eastern part. We tend to be a bit more pessimistic maybe and a bit more down to earth about our impact and the challenges and so on. We don't try to sugar coat things. We rarely look enthusiastic or happy about our work. But you know it's a good discipline. So I think the results kind of speak for themselves. What what I think you know um so mistral for example was you know sometimes it's mock because it's not considered the frontier lab like open entropic whatever okay but look at the staff and the resources and so on. I know the best people from Mistral they they you know they can be compared to the top of the top of the biggest lab. So then there's a question of scale and scale of resources indeed. So what you the unfortunate tweet you mentioned about the 30 million euros you know is is one of them
>> but yeah I mean other than that people are there are a lot of very strong people and you know they have done also a lot of great things for American companies I mean Yanuk was is one of them obviously but it's not only him Sammy Benjio who used to lead brain is now is leading Apple MLR the amount of French people in the leadership of big tech AI research is is is very charge.
>> Wonderful. Well, I love that.
>> I get carried a bit when I speak.
>> I love I love the fighting spirit and this is a wonderful way to end it. So, Neil, thank you so much. This was uh terrific. Really appreciate it.
>> Thanks.
