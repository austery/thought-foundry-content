BRENE BROWN: I felt like I had
tapped into something that both
gave me a sense
of real stability,
but also a springboard for
some power that I needed to do
what he was asking me to do.
And so "strong ground" became
my mantra, not just in the gym,
but also before a hard meeting,
before coaching with a CEO,
before talking to my own coach.
It was very much,
OK, strong ground.
Find your athletic stance, get
grounded down in your values,
not just for stability,
but also for agility.
And so, I think,
right now, given
the velocity, this
pace of change,
we need to find our ground.
[THEME MUSIC]
ADI IGNATIUS: So I'm here
with Brené Brown, a research
professor at the University of
Houston, a best-selling author,
and host of the Dare
to Lead podcast.
Her latest book
is Strong Ground--
The Lessons of
Daring Leadership,
the Tenacity of Paradox, and
the Wisdom of the Human Spirit.
Thank you for being on IdeaCast.
BRENE BROWN: I'm
excited to be with you.
ADI IGNATIUS: So
we're in a moment
that, I guess, I
would call dynamic,
and I don't mean in the
necessarily positive sense,
but where you have volatility,
but also major shifts.
And I feel like almost
everything is up for grabs.
A little bit like the
1960s, although very, very,
very different.
What does good leadership look
like when the ground seems
to be shifting so dramatically?
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
I think, it's interesting.
The word "dynamic"
is interesting.
I think what I'm
feeling personally
is massive instability
and unpredictability.
Even our ability to forecast
in short increments of time
has been completely disrupted.
And I think good
leadership right now
is about settling the ball.
I'm going to jump right
into a sports metaphor.
Are you going with me?
I mean--
ADI IGNATIUS: I'm good.
I'm good with that.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah,
I think it's about--
the metaphor I've
been thinking about
lately is a visual that
I have of both my kids
when they played soccer
when they were five.
And five-year-old soccer
is a really fun thing
to watch because balls come
in really fast and hard
at head height.
And a kid sticks their
foot up in the air
and tries to kick it somewhere
smart at head height,
and invariably, it
goes off the field.
But I think that's what a lot
of leaders are doing right now.
Balls are coming in hard and
fast, unpredictably high.
And instead of jumping
up and catching the ball
with their chest, dropping
the ball to the ground,
putting their foot on the
ball to maintain possession,
looking down the pitch,
thinking strategically, thinking
and anticipating
where people are
going to be based on
training and skill,
we're just making really
fast, non-strategic decisions
that sometimes are because
we are in scarcity mode
and we're not deploying
the skills we have.
And more often,
right now, I think,
we don't have the
skills we need.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I think
there's one other thing, which
is that in periods of
uncertainty, hyper uncertainty,
there is a school
of thought that you
have to be decisive, right?
Don't be a victim of this.
You have to-- so there's
a bias toward action.
So I feel like one
of the paradoxes
is that versus systems thinking
is having this of comeback,
right--
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: --where
counter advice is, no.
You were saying.
Slow it down.
Think holistically about
how a decision will
affect whatever it is--
the entire company,
the entire organization.
So how are you seeing those
two imperatives play out?
BRENE BROWN: Well, as a
big fan of systems theory,
I love to see--
I don't that it ever
went away, but I
love to see the
renaissance of the language
and thinking about it.
I think the foundational,
strategic thinking
of everything we're doing right
now has to be systems theory.
How internal
systems are impacted
by what we're doing, how that
bounces off external systems.
In systems theory, we learn that
in order for systems to operate,
the boundaries of a system
have to be permeable.
So feedback flows in
and out of systems
bringing new information.
We recalibrate.
We send out information.
So there's a permeability
around systems,
and whether that's biological
or leadership systems,
it doesn't matter.
When we don't have those
permeable boundaries
and the walls around a
system close, which you're
seeing everywhere right
now out of self-protection,
what ends up happening is a
system becomes self-referencing.
So an example of this is a
CEO feels a ton of pressure
to develop and implement
an AI strategy.
But because of scarcity,
the system walls,
they're not taking
time for feedback.
They're not red teaming.
They're not doing a pre-mortem.
They're not thinking through
alignment of business strategy
and technology strategy.
They're not skilling
up their people.
And so what ends up
happening is that system
becomes self-referencing.
And in this climate
that's losing.
ADI IGNATIUS: On
AI specifically,
that report that we all
read from MIT that said,
95% of AI projects do
not have a positive ROI,
whether that's the methodology
was accurate, whether it was
too soon or not too soon
to do research like that,
I've talked to a lot of people
who are taking that to heart
and are slowing things down,
applying more of a systems
approach, specifically to AI.
We know it produces
value, but just
kind of getting the first
thing we can out there is
no longer the viable approach.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
It's one of the
things that I seem to,
in this book, be taking a lot
of constructs and concepts
that we use and adding
an adjective to them.
So yes, urgency, but
productive urgency.
Yes, risk taking, but
strategic risk taking.
I feel like I'm using every--
I'm taking a battery,
a pause, adjectives
and adding it to everything
that people are feeling.
So yes, we need to be urgent,
but unproductive urgency
is always action over impact.
And I think when you
look at that MIT study--
and yeah, people are asking
very good questions about it,
but it should not be ignored.
And I'm a tech optimist.
What I am not is
optimistic about people's
reflexive decision-making
when they're in scarcity mode.
ADI IGNATIUS: So on the topic
of authenticity, whether we like
that word or not, we've lived
through this period where
leaders were comfortable,
or many leaders,
the best leaders were
comfortable with being
outspoken about their
values and values
like sustainability,
like diversity,
like long-term thinking.
Suddenly, in the
US, at least, a lot
of the CEOs who spoke
that way now don't dare
do so because these topics
have become controversial.
And in the context of the
authenticity or vulnerability
that seems to produce
the leadership
we admire, are we seeing an
absence of authentic leadership
now in this suddenly highly
politicized business moment?
BRENE BROWN: I think
we're seeing fear.
I don't think of
value that can be
abandoned based on an
administration is a value.
It might be a marketing
or branding idea,
but a value that's
abandoned based
on who's in the White House
is not really a core value.
The expression of values
may change over time,
and they should.
For example, there are a
lot of companies right now
who have integrity
as a value, but when
they operationalize that
value, they've never
contemplated data governance.
They've never
contemplated privacy.
They've never contemplated
authentic voice politically.
And so, I think,
it's a leader's job
to be able to lead for
impact around mission,
regardless of the
administration.
They don't get a break there.
And it's also a leader's
job not to abandon
the values of the company.
And so that is a very short-term
game in a long-term world.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, I like that.
I wrote a piece
along those lines,
pitting Davos man versus
Mar-a-Lago man, and just said,
this is a clarifying moment.
If you really believe
in these things,
this is a moment to double down.
If you don't, as
you were saying,
it was just performative,
maybe that's not a value
and that's not who you are
or who your company ism so.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
And also if it was
performative and you're not
finding a way to move
forward in your integrity,
then don't be shocked by
the consumer backlash.
ADI IGNATIUS: Absolutely.
So the book is
called Strong Ground,
and, let's give it--
listeners who haven't read it
yet, what is Strong
Ground exactly?
Obviously, it's a big book,
but, the short version,
what is Strong Ground?
And, how did you decide that
was the concept that you really
wanted to identify
to drive this book?
BRENE BROWN: It starts
with pickleball, of course.
ADI IGNATIUS: Of course.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
A tennis player for 30 years,
I scoffed at pickleball
for two years, and then
it took me two games
to start playing
six days a week.
So--
ADI IGNATIUS: I would do it, but
I'm too young for pickleball.
BRENE BROWN: I got whipped up on
yesterday pretty bad by a couple
of 20-year-olds.
So it has its moments, for sure.
I got injured.
And when I went to a trainer,
he told me I had no core,
and that I was--
ADI IGNATIUS: Aw.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah, which
was rude, but yeah,
he actually had me take
a test, and he's like,
scored a 10 out of 10.
And I was like,
of course, I did.
And he said, no, a 10 out of 22.
Sorry.
And he said your
physical age is like 77.
I was like, oh, my God.
And he said, and--
ADI IGNATIUS: A perfect 10.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS:
Perfect 10 out of 22.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah, exactly.
And you don't have
to be a researcher
to be like, damn, that's bad.
So he basically said, I
had a compensatory injury,
that I didn't have the
big, strong muscles that I
needed to do what I
wanted to do on the court.
So I was using
inefficient muscle groups
and I was getting hurt.
And the more he talked, the
more I thought about the leaders
I work with.
He said things like,
we're going to go slow,
we're going to be
thoughtful, and we're not
going to build on dysfunction.
And so in a very serious moment,
while I was trying to find
my lats-- which I was
confused, I didn't have--
he looked at me and he
said-- he called me "Brown."
He was a very tough guy.
He said, "Brown,
find the ground."
And I said, what do you mean?
He said, "Find the ground."
So I looked down at the floor
and he said, no, not the floor.
Find your ground.
Use your mind to
connect with your body
and feel the ground
under your feet.
And it took me a minute,
but when I did it,
I felt like I had tapped into
something that both gave me
a sense of real stability,
but also a springboard
for some power that I needed to
do what he was asking me to do.
And so "strong ground" became
my mantra, not just in the gym,
but also before a hard meeting,
before coaching with a CEO.
It was very much,
OK, strong ground.
Find your athletic stance,
get grounded in your values,
not just for stability,
but also for agility.
And so I think, right
now, given the velocity,
this pace of change, we
need to find our ground.
Both to provide stability--
I mean, here's the thing, Adi.
We're not
neurobiologically wired
for what's happening right now.
Our nervous systems, our
brains hate uncertainty.
It makes an action
bias look like nothing.
Right now, we're just
solve, solve solve.
So I think the ground
is that place--
it's like if there's a chapter
in the book on the tush push,
just the physics of
the ground, I think,
is what we need right now.
ADI IGNATIUS: For our
very global audience,
we will explain that "tush
push" is a play in the National
Football League, but it's a play
that involves elaborate teamwork
and is inordinately successful.
But anyway, I'm just--
BRENE BROWN: It's
very successful.
And if you're not in the US
or not a fan of the National
Football League, I can tell
you that where it came from
is scrum in rugby.
So it's a bunch of
folks creating force
to move a ball by grounding into
the turf and pushing together.
And why I love it as a
metaphor for leadership
is it's almost hard to defend
because our thinking is
if we go over this
mass of people
creating force and
moving, that's smart.
But the lesson,
Newtonian physics,
is when you lose
touch with the ground,
your force is
completely depleted.
Because force is not
just your body weight,
but your body weight times
pushing against the ground.
And so I think Newtonian physics
is a really good leadership
metaphor for what
we need right now.
A bunch of folks
in an organization
firmly planted in their
values, very clear on mission,
very clear on goals, pushing
in the same direction,
and not becoming untethered.
ADI IGNATIUS: So we
often ask leaders,
what is it you want from HBR?
What is the most valuable kind
of content we can give you?
And the answer's often, we want
to see examples of other people,
of our competitors even,
in some crucible moment
or solving some problem.
And people have said it's
like watching game tape.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah,
ADI IGNATIUS: Right?
That's kind of what
they get out of it.
So you have this phrase-- use
this phrase "pocket presence"
for leaders, which I love that
because it gets at this hyper
uncertain, hyper
volatile moment,
but how you have to execute.
Talk about pocket presence.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah,
it's interesting
because I came up
during a period of time
where there was a lot of
focus on executive presence.
And that's a really
gauzy construct for me
as a researcher.
I don't-- at its best, I don't
understand exactly what it
means.
At its worst, I think it
introduces a ton of bias
into what do we think a
leader should look like.
In this very funny
moment, I have
to share that I
texted Adam Grant,
and we're really good friends.
And I said, hey,
OK if I take down
executive presence in the book?
And I just got the three dots
on the iPhone, I was like, oh,
uh-oh.
ADI IGNATIUS: You're in trouble.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah, he's going
to tell me, don't do it.
And he said, yes, absolutely.
It's cover for discriminating
against introverts in women.
And then two seconds later,
"And while you're at it,
could you take down
charisma, as well?
Pocket presence
is very observable
and measurable and teachable.
And it's a term out of again,
the National Football League.
It's about a
collective competency.
A quarterback is said to have
pocket presence in the National
Football League or College
Football, high school football,
when he gets the ball, the folks
who protect him have about three
seconds to protect
him before, like,
1,500 pounds defenders come
crashing in, and can he,
in a very short amount of time,
make decisions about how to move
the ball down the field?
Run it, pass it, hand
it off, whatever it is.
And underneath this term is
what I think we need today.
One, anticipatory thinking.
He doesn't throw the ball
to where the receiver is.
He reads the field
and throws the ball
to where the receiver
is going to be
in a second or two seconds,
based on their training.
Two, temporal awareness.
We completely underestimate
this skill set for leaders.
Temporal awareness, the
rumor has it, that Brady--
Tom Brady, the quarterback for
the Patriots for many years--
had an internal clock
that was so precise,
he knew exactly when
to let go of the ball.
And he could tell where
the people were around him,
protecting him by the shaking
of the field through his feet.
I mean, this is
temporal presence.
Leaders need temporal presence.
How much time do I
really have here?
How do I slow down my
team without losing
a sense of urgency?
So anticipatory awareness,
temporal awareness,
and the third big one is--
and this is, I
think, a hard one--
which is situational awareness.
What system is my team sitting
in within our organization,
within the market, and within
the geopolitical world?
And how does that
impact our decisions
that we make every day?
So I love pocket presence as a
collective competency for teams.
ADI IGNATIUS: So
part of this has
to be pattern recognition, too.
You're doing it
over and over again.
So my favorite quarterback--
I'm a Washington Commanders
fan, so Jayden Daniels
is-- he's a kid, he's
in his second year,
and he is incredible.
But one of the things that
seems to differentiate him,
differentiated skill, is he
basically uses a kind of a VR
set thing, where--
so all day long,
even when he's not on the field
and he doesn't have anybody else
to play with, he's basically
experiencing everything
you're describing, where
you have a couple seconds,
1,500 pounds enemies is bearing
down on you, and yet, somehow,
you see the whole field.
And I'm interested,
how do executives
develop-- how do they get that
kind of pattern recognition?
I mean, you got to
learn on the job.
You can't really do it. pretend.
But how do they
develop that skill?
BRENE BROWN: The biggest chapter
in the book and was the hardest
chapter I've ever
written in my career--
and I've written I've written
a lot of books and a lot
of chapters, but-- it was a
chapter on what I call "grounded
confidence."
And how I got there is through
the initial leadership study
on courageous leadership,
where my hypothesis
was completely wrong.
I've never been more
wrong in my life.
So we studied 150
transformational leaders,
and we defined and
operationalized
transformative
leaders by leaders
who created performance
results that
were enviable by
their competitors
and had cultures where
people wanted to work.
And it was shocking to me
because it was the first time
in my 30-year career as a
qualitative researcher that when
we asked 150 leaders across the
world, different industries,
"What's the future
of leadership?",
they had the same answer.
Which is, we must
have braver leaders
and more courageous cultures.
My hypothesis was the biggest
barrier to courageous leadership
is fear.
And, Adi, I'll tell you just a
moment that I'll never forget.
It's just etched in my mind.
I was sitting across from
one of those leaders,
kind of playing back
the findings to him.
And he said, let
me be very clear.
If you're creating a list
of courageous leaders,
and you're defining that as
people who don't feel fear,
don't put me on your list.
I'm afraid every day.
And I was like, what?
So it's not fear
that is the barrier
to courageous leadership.
It turns out that it's armor.
It's how we protect
ourselves when we're afraid,
when we don't have the emotional
awareness to say, shoot,
I'm in fear right now.
I'm making
scarcity-based decisions.
I'm not thinking fully.
So what we replace armor
with is grounded confidence.
And one of the big grounded
confidence skills--
it's a collection of 30
skills and mindsets--
was pattern recognition,
just what you named.
And by another name,
it's intuition.
There's a big debate about
whether, do we use our gut
or do we use data?
I just watched something
recently where Jeff Bezos said,
if it comes down to data or
my gut, I'm going with my gut.
But it's actually not
how intuition and pattern
recognition works.
It's a cognitive process
where your mind filters
through a hundred
files very quickly
to recognize a pattern where
you've been there before--
how did you handle it
and what was successful?
One of the greatest
ways that leaders
can develop pattern
recognition--
because we don't watch tape.
There's nothing to watch.
Makes it easier in sport--
is to make sure when there's
a failure or a setback
or a disappointment around
a decision, a strategy,
or a performance
metric, that there's
open discussion about that.
And that, that discussion is
about learning and embedding
the learning.
Because what you're
doing is you're
creating a mental
file system that
sharpens pattern recognition.
And so if you want to
increase pattern recognition,
open conversations around
hard learnings is key.
ADI IGNATIUS: That's great.
Yeah, I mean, look, we
all want to be Steve Jobs.
I don't need no stinking
focus groups, right?
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: But
I think what you're
talking about is
there are processes
that can make you smarter, can
make your institutions smarter.
I want to get back,
though, to what
you said about armor, because
I think that's important.
The idea of breaking
down armor, I
mean, it's a classic of, I don't
know, adolescent psychology,
neurobiology, breaking down
the armor, the hero's journey,
all these things.
BRENE BROWN: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: But the
armor comes back, right?
And we wrap ourselves in
armor, yeah, to feel safe.
And I guess, I'd love your
thoughts on how do you
embrace fear as a positive?
I always thought
if you're anxious,
that means it matters
and build on that.
But the armor comes
back and how do
you perpetually try to
break away the armor that
holds you back as a leader?
BRENE BROWN: Over
the past six years,
we've taken 150,000 leaders
across 45 countries through
the Dare to Lead programming
around courageous leadership,
the training.
And we got a lot
of data from that,
because we collect
data on everything.
And it seems simple,
but it's also difficult
and requires courage.
You cannot effectively start
peeling off your armor if you
don't know what it is and you
don't recognize the situations
in which you use
it or reach for it.
I would say-- it's
interesting that you
mentioned the hero's journey
and adolescent psychology.
I would say that the greatest
developmental milestone
of midlife is a moment
meant where all of us
say this no longer serves.
This kept me safe
as a kid growing up.
It kept me safe in my 20s and
30s in my years of acquisition
and acquirement and trying
to figure out who I am.
But it's tight and it's heavy.
I don't even who's
under here anymore.
And it's not working.
And so I think, one of
the first things that we
do as leaders is we take them
through a process where you
have to identify what it is?
Like, for me, my armor--
I have lots of armor.
Intensity.
I get super intense.
And because I'm a founder and a
CEO, when I get super intense,
the people around me
get quiet and move away.
The exact opposite of what I
need to make good decisions.
But I'm self-protecting.
I micromanage.
I go into the worst kind of
founder mode you've ever seen.
I will pick the font.
I will check your email.
I will pick the color.
And I get very perfectionistic.
And I get overly
decisive, which is weird.
So a lot of people have
analysis paralysis.
I just sit in a meeting and
go, no, we're not doing that.
Move that.
Change that.
The admissions, no,
we're pivoting here.
Don't do that.
And then I'll look
up and say, oh, crap.
I think I'm in some fear.
Let's not do those things.
To which my team responds,
we don't write anything down
when you're acting this way.
Yeah, but I think,
if there's someone
that you really love and
trust outside of work,
it's a brave question to ask.
What kind of behaviors do I
engage in when I'm in fear
and I'm armoring up?
ADI IGNATIUS: HBR has been
around for more than 100 years.
You have been writing
best-selling books
on a lot of the topics
we hold dear for decades.
And there are millions of ideas
coming from other sources that
are good ideas, and
they're research-based,
and they're tested.
Why are we still not very good
at leadership and not very good
at management?
We can point to one or two
examples of this person
really nails it.
But most of the examples
are counter indicators.
Why are we not better
at these things
that you and I spend so much
time researching, writing about,
trying to share best
practices, et cetera?
BRENE BROWN: Because who
we are is how we lead.
And I don't care
who the scholar is
or what the approach
is, if you don't have
a very significant
level of self-awareness,
emotional granularity, emotional
awareness, systems thinking,
I think, it's very,
very tough to lead.
And I think we'd rather do
pretty much anything other
than figure out how we're
getting in our own way.
And so to take a group of
people with a very serious goal,
a serious mission,
a lot of pressure,
a lot of external and
internal complexity,
and get this group
of people to move
in the same direction
with power and purpose
is an extraordinary thing to
do over a long period of time,
and requires really
understanding yourself
and how human beings work.
And I think you can squeeze good
performance and growth, whatever
your metric is, on a short-term
basis with power over fear,
external reward.
But if you want something
long-term and meaningful,
it's got to be
intrinsic, and it's
got to be about self-awareness,
and I think that's hard.
ADI IGNATIUS: To people
who are listening
to this who are thinking, yeah,
although this sounds like quite
a journey, if I want to make
progress in these areas,
what are some things
people can do,
can think about right now to
become more effective leaders?
BRENE BROWN: I would
start with this.
I don't think
people are OK, Adi.
I don't think
we're OK right now.
I think collectively, we are
dysregulated, distrustful,
and disconnected.
And I think that makes leading
particularly difficult right
now.
If I could wave a magic
wand and change one thing,
one skill set that
leaders had, I would say,
figure out what it takes to
create time where none exists.
Figure out how to take
a breath and challenge
your own thinking
or your behavior
or how you're showing up.
When there's a big decision
or strategy being made,
how do you take a deep
breath and slow a room down
to be thoughtful?
To run a pre-mortem
on what's happening?
To invite a red team in to take
a look at your decision-making?
Settle yourself.
And take a deep breath and
settle the people around you.
And I think that's a challenge,
but if you can start there--
there's no self-reflection,
there's no self-awareness,
there's no smart strategy,
there's no AI approach,
there's nothing without
grounded thinking.
So to take a deep breath
and slow things down--
and I'm talking about minutes.
I'm not talking about months.
And what really scares me
the most-- and this is,
to be honest with you-- very
ubiquitous with the companies
I'm in right now, I'm in
four different companies
right now across
different industries.
Three of them--
yeah, three of them--
one is US-based.
Three of them are global--
and the thing that I hear over
and over, which probably led me
to this answer to
your question was,
I don't have time
to think about it.
I mean, dangerous.
ADI IGNATIUS: And do you feel
you're on strong ground now?
BRENE BROWN: All the time?
No.
Am I getting better at
recognizing when I'm not
and the cost of that to me,
personally and professionally?
Yes, I am aware of when
I'm on strong ground,
and I'm aware of when I'm not.
I was working with a football
team about a month ago.
And I asked a couple of the
offensive linemen to come up.
And I asked them to get
on their tippy toes,
and then on one foot.
And I said, I'm
going to push you.
And I pushed them into the
shoulders and they fell over.
And of course, all
their teammates
were like, damn, she got you.
Then I said-- I asked
each of the players,
tell me your values.
What are your two big values?
And they told me what they were.
And I said, plant your
left foot in one value,
plant your right foot
in the other value.
And I said, I want to
see if I can move you.
And it was like pushing
into a concrete wall.
And so, we are, again,
dysregulated, distrusting,
and disconnected.
And the first place we need
to start regulating, trusting,
and reconnecting is
ourself to something
bigger than us, that provides
stability and agility
at the same time.
ADI IGNATIUS: I'm
going to bring you down
to talk to my softball team
in New London, Connecticut.
You can tell us how
to run to first base
without pulling a
hamstring every time.
BRENE BROWN: Oh, God.
Yeah, I mean,
that's what happens.
And that's real.
ADI IGNATIUS: Brené
Brown, thank you
for being our guest
today on IdeaCast.
BRENE BROWN: What a pleasure.
Thank you for having me.
