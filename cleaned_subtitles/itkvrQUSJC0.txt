I believe this is it right here that is it yeah yes I mean to think of the the fact that we were able to build a million uh Cubit quantum computer in a thing of this size is just unbelievable like I mean that and and that's I think the Crux of it right which is unless and until we could do that you can't dream of building a utility scale quantum computer and you're saying the eventual million cubits will go on a chip size okay amazing the fundamental breakthrough here the vision that we've always had is you need a physics breakthrough uh in order to build a utility scale quantum computer that works um and so we took that path you know uh which was the the path of sort of saying look the one way for having that less noisy or the more reliable Cubit is to bet on a physical property that by definition um is more reliable and that's kind of what led us to those Mayana uh zero modes as the thing to go um which was theorized in the 1930s and so so the question was can we actually physically fabricate these things can we actually build them so the big breakthrough effectively and I know you talked to Chan was um that we now finally have existence proof uh and a physics breakthrough of a myana zero modes um in a new phase of matter effectively right so this this is why I think we like the analogy of thinking of this as the transistor moment of quantum Computing where we effectively have a new uh phase which is the topological phase where which is more reli which which means we can even now uh reliably hide the quantum information and measure it uh and then and we can fabricate it and so now that we have it we feel like with that core foundational um fabrication technique uh out of the way we can start building a myana chip uh that myana one which I think is going to basically be the first chip that will be capable of a million cubits physical and then on that thousands of M thousands of logical cubits eror corrected and then it game on right so then you kind suddenly have now got the ability to build a real utility Square quantum computer and that to me is now so much more feasible right we've been work because without something like this you will still be able to achieve Milestones but you'll never be able to build a utility scale computer and so that's why we're excited about it amazing the um the the million uh topological cubits thousands of logical cubits what is the estimated timeline to scale up to that level what what does the mor law here if you've got the first transistor look like like we've obviously been working on this for 30 years I'm glad we now have uh the fabrication the physics breakthrough and the fabrication breakthrough this is I mean I mean I wish we had a quantum computer because by the way the first thing the quantum computer will allow us to do is build quantum computers because it's going to be so much easier to simulate uh atom by atom construction of these new Quantum Gates essentially but in any case uh to me I think the next real thing is now that we have the fabrication technique uh let us go build that first fall tolerant quantum computer um and that'll be the logical thing so I would say now I can say oh maybe 27 28 29 we we will be able to actually build this right so now that we have this one gate can I I put the thing into an integrated circuit and then actually put these integrated circuits into a real computer uh that I think is where the next logical step is and what do you see as 2728 you've got it working is it um is it like a thing you ask us through the API is it something you're using internally for your own research and materials and chemistry see one thing that have been excited about is even in today's world right um because we were we had this Quantum program and we had we could say hey here's you know some apis to it the Breakthrough we had maybe two years ago was to sort of think of this HPC stack and AI stack and Quantum together in fact if you think about it right um AI is like an emulator um of the simulator like Quantum is like a simulator of nature like what what is what Quantum going to do by the way uh Quantum is not going to replace classical right Quantum is great at what Quantum can do and classical will be also because you can't like I mean like to be able to Quantum is going to be fantastic for anything that is not data heavy but it's got more exploration heavy in terms of the state space right so which is it should be data light but exponential states that you want to explore and you know simulation is a great one uh chemical physics what have you biology uh so one of the things that we've started doing is really using AI as the emulation engine but you can then train so the way I think of it as you know if you have ai plus Quantum maybe you'll use quantum to generate synthetic data that then gets used by AI to train better models that know how to model something like chemistry or physics or what have you and and these two things will get used together so even today that's kind of effectively what we're doing with the combination of HPC and Ai and I hope to replace some of the HPC pieces with quantum computers
