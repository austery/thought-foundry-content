classical economics picture an economy as a massive machine that runs best when left alone this is the core idea behind classical economics born in the 18th century when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776 Smith introduced us to the Invisible Hand the idea that millions of people each pursuing their own self-interest unknowingly create order in the economy when a baker bakes bread they're not thinking about feeding Society they're trying to make money yet their pursuit of profit ensures people get their daily bread classical economists believe that prices wages and markets naturally adjust themselves if bread becomes too expensive bakers will see an opportunity to make money more Bakers enter the market increasing Supply and bringing prices down if wages in one industry are high workers flock there until wages balance out this school gave us David Ricardo theory of comparative advantage the idea that countries should produce what they're best at relative to others England might be better than Portugal at making both wine and cloth but if england is much better at cloth and only slightly better at wine both countries benefit when England focuses on cloth and Portugal on wine the classical economists had one major warning government interference disrupts this natural order tariffs price controls and heavy regulations are like throwing a wrench into our economic machine their motto l a fair Let It Be marxian economics if classical economics saw the free market as a harmonious dance Karl Mars saw it as a battlefield writing in the midst of the Industrial Revolution Marx wasn't just proposing an economic theory he was diagnosing what he saw as a fatal disease in capitalism at the heart of marxian Economics is the labor theory of value the idea that a product's True Value comes from the human labor put into making it picture a worker in a factory making chairs in 8 hours they might make 10 chairs that sell for $50 each their wage $80 for the day marks would ask if the worker created $500 worth of value why do they only receive $80 the remaining $420 is what he called Surplus value essentially profit extracted from the workers's labor this leads to Marx's concept of exploitation capitalists the factory owners grow wealthy not through their own work but by pocketing this Surplus value Mark saw this as an inherent feature of capitalism not a bug like a pressure cooker building steam he believed this exploitation would eventually lead to Revolution Marx introduced the idea of historical materialism the notion that economic systems naturally evolve through stages just as feudalism gave way to capitalism he predicted capitalism would inevitably collapse under its own contradictions leading to socialism and eventually communism Game Theory imagine economics as a giant chess game where every move you make depends on what you think others will do that's game theory developed by John Von Newman and later revolutionized by John Nash yes the Beautiful Mind guy while other economic theories try to predict markets Game Theory asks a different question how do people behave when their success depends on others choices let's start with the most famous example the prisoners dilemma two criminals are rested and separated each has two choices stay silent or betray their partner if both stay silent they each get one year in prison if both betray they each get three years but if one betrays while the other stays silent the betrayer goes free while their partner gets 5 years the rational choice is to betray but here's the twist if both make this rational choice they end up worse off than if they'd cooperated this simple game explains everything from arms races to price Wars to climate change companies might all benefit from keeping prices high but each has an incentive to undercut the others countries might benefit from reducing carbon emissions but each has an incentive to keep polluting While others cut back it's the tragedy of rational self-interest Nash's biggest contribution was proving that in any game there's at least one point where no player can benefit by changing their strategy alone the famous Nash equilibrium think about traffic we all drive on the right side in America not because it's inherently better but because everyone else does changing your strategy alone would be disastrous Game Theory isn't just academic it's revolutionized business strategy international relations and even biology it's used to design auctions negotiate treaties and understand everything from dating markets to animal behavior it shows us that sometimes the pursuit of self-interest leads to everyone losing neoclassical economics in the late 19th century economists had a revelation what if we stopped looking at the economy through the lens of social classes and instead focused on how individuals make choices enter neoclassical economics which revolutionized how we think about value and price unlike classical or marxian economists who thought value came from labor neoclassicals introduced marginalism the idea that value comes from the additional satisfaction you get from one more unit of something think about eating pizza the First Slice amazing the fourth slice less exciting the eighth slice you might even pay someone to take it away this diminishing marginal utility explains why water essential for life is cheap while diamonds which we can live without are expensive neoclassicals view the economy as a comp complex web of supply and demand curves always seeking equilibrium they assume people are rational actors who make decisions to maximize their satisfaction given their limited resources businesses aim to maximize profits consumers aim to maximize utility and prices act as signals coordinating this elaborate dance their model of perfect competition envisions many small firms competing with identical products complete information and no barriers to country while this rarely exists in reality it serves as a benchmark for measuring market efficiency and understanding how prices are determined kenian economics the Great Depression shattered the idea that markets always fix themselves in 1936 John Maynard KES stepped in with a radical new vision sometimes the Invisible Hand needs a push K's flipped economic thinking on its head by focusing on aggregate demand the total spending in an economy his key Insight during a recession people and businesses get scared people save more businesses invest less but here's the Paradox what's smart for individuals becomes disastrous for the economy when everyone saves at once spending drops businesses lay off workers those workers spend less and the economy spirals downward this is where canes said government must step in if businesses won't invest and consumers won't spend the government should fill the Gap build Bridges hire workers cut taxes do whatever it takes to get money flowing again this spending creates a multiplier effect when the government hires a construction worker that worker buys groceries the grocery store owner buys new equipment and so on with each dollar of government spending generating more than a dollar of economic activity K's most revolutionary idea in a depression Thrift isn't a virtue it's the problem to him trying to save your way out of a recession was like trying to lose weight by starving yourself it might make sense individually but collectively it's a recipe for disaster supply side economics remember the 1980s when Reagan promised that tax cuts would pay for themselves that's supply side economics in action while Keynesian focus on boosting demand Supply Siders say we've got it backwards focus on production and the rest will follow the theory Rose to prominence during a time of stagflation when the economy was both stagnating and experiencing High inflation something Keynesian economics struggle to explain their big idea is that high taxes and regulations discourage people from producing cut taxes especially on businesses and high earners and you'll unleash a wave of investment and work effort the economy grows so much that government actually collects more revenue from lower tax rates this concept was famously illustrated by Economist Arthur laugher on a napkin creating what we now call the laugher curve Supply Siders believe in trickle down effects when the wealthy get tax breaks they invest in new businesses create jobs and boost wages like water flowing downhill the benefits eventually reach everyone they argue that high marginal tax rates discourage work and investment after all why work harder if the government takes most of your additional earnings but here's where it gets controversial while supply side policies led to economic boom they also coincided with growing deficits and inequality the 1981 tax cuts didn't pay for themselves as promised by 1982 Reagan had to raise some taxes to combat growing deficits critics say this proves the theory doesn't work supporters argue taxes were still too high and regulations too burdensome supply side economics fundamentally changed how we think about taxes and growth today most economists agree that tax rates matter for economic behavior but debate the size of the effect the theory remains influential in political debates about tax policy though often more as a political tool than an economic Doctrine monetarism in the 1970s as inflation spiraled out of control Milton Freedman and the monitor interests emerged with a direct challenge to Keynesian dominance their message was simple the real problem isn't managing demand it's managing money to monitor interests inflation isn't some mysterious Force it's pure mathematics print too much money and each dollar becomes worth less they summed it up in one famous phrase inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon think of it like adding water to soup the more you add the less flavorful each spoonful becomes fredman argued that government attempts to fine-tune the economy often do more harm than good there's a lag between economic problems and policy responses like trying to drive a car by looking in the rearview mirror instead he advocated for a simple rule increase the money supply by a small steady amount each year no fancy policies no government spending sprees just stable predictable monetary growth monitor interests also introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment a baseline level of joblessness that's actually healthy for the economy trying to push unemployment below this natural rate through government policy would only lead to inflation not lasting Prosperity their solution let markets work keep money stable and get government out of the way development economics why do some Nations Prosper While others stay poor this isn't just an academic question it's about billions of people's lives development economics tackles this by looking Beyond Simple models of growth revealing that Prosperity isn't just about capital and labor it's about the complex web of Institutions culture and history that shape economic progress development economists identified something Insidious called poverty y traps Vicious Cycles where poverty itself prevents growth imagine a farmer too poor to buy fertilizer without fertilizer yields stay low with low yields they can't save enough to buy fertilizer next year now multiply this across millions of people if you're too poor to save or invest in education you stay poor if your country can't build infrastructure it can't attract business if corruption is widespread honest Behavior becomes costly each problem reinforces the others but here's where it gets interesting development economists found that small targeted interventions can break these Cycles micro Finance programs pioneered by muhamad Unice in Bangladesh give small loans to entrepreneurs who' never qualify for traditional banking conditional cash transfers like Brazil's Bolsa Familia pay families to keep kids in school even Simple Solutions like adding I assault boosted IQ scores and productivity across developing nations the field has also shattered old myths about development we used to think poor countries just needed more capital or better technology but countries like Argentina started rich and fell behind While others like Singapore started poor and prospered the difference institutions property rights rule of law education systems and political stability matter more than Raw resources or money this leads to development economics big lesson Economic Development isn't just about money it's about transforming societies markets alone aren't enough you need Education Health Care good governance and institutions that encourage Innovation and Enterprise it's not just about getting richer it's about building the foundations for lasting Prosperity Austrian School while other economists were busy building mathematical models the Austrian School said we were missing the Point founded by Carl manger and developed by Scholars like Friedrich Hayek and ludvig Von mises the austrians insisted that economics isn't about equations it's about Human Action their most distinctive idea is their theory of business Cycles unlike other economists who blame recessions on insufficient demand or monetary mishaps austrians point the finger at central banks when central banks keep interest rates artificially low it's like giving the economy a sugar Rush businesses embark on ambitious projects thinking there's more savings available than there really is but eventually reality hits the Sugar Rush ends projects fail and the economy crashes the austrians are also famous for their critique of central planning Hayek argued that no Central planner could ever gather enough information to efficiently run an economy think about trying to coordinate what millions of people want for breakfast tomorrow it's impossible markets through the price system solve this problem automatically every purchase and sale sends signals about what people want and need creating what they call spontaneous order this school takes individual Freedom seriously to them the economy isn't a machine to be managed but a complex network of human choices that should be left free to evolve naturally behavioral economics what if humans aren't the rational calculators that traditional economics assumes in the 1970s psychologists Daniel man and Amos fski started poking holes in our assumptions about human rationality giving birth to behavioral economics their research revealed we're walking bundles of biases and mental shortcuts we feel the pain of losing $100 more intensely than the pleasure of gaining $100 we'll drive across town to save $5 on a $15 item but won't do the same to save $5 on a $500 item we buy gym memberships in January knowing will barely use them traditional economics can't explain these behaviors but behavioral economics can this school introduced the concept of bounded rationality we don't always make the best decisions just ones that are good enough we're influenced by how choices are framed by what others are doing and by our emotions ever notice how stores Mark prices as $999 instead of $10 or how hotels put 80% of guests reuse their towels signs in bathrooms that's behavioral economics at work the implications are huge if people aren't perfectly rational then markets aren't perfectly efficient this opens the door for nudges subtle changes in how choices are presented that can help people make better decisions while preserving their freedom to choose new institutional economics if traditional economics sees markets as a frictionless machine new instit tional economics niie reminds us that in the real world nothing runs that smoothly founded by Ronald Co and developed by Scholars like Douglas North ni asks why do we need institutions like corporations laws and property rights in the first place their answer revolves around transaction costs the friction and economic exchanges imagine trying to make a movie without a corporation you'd need separate contracts with every actor camera operator and crew member you'd have to negotiate every decision the paperwork alone would kill the project this is why we create institutions like film companies they reduce these transaction costs and make complex projects possible ni also emphasizes path dependence how history shapes Economic Development why does Silicon Valley dominate Tech why do some countries stay poor While others Prosper it's not just about resources or policies it's about the evolution of Institution over time a country's legal system property rights and business culture create patterns that are hard to change this school sees Economic Development as more than just accumulating Capital it's about building better institutions from reliable courts to functioning markets bad institutions can trap countries in poverty while good ones create the foundation for Prosperity public Choice Theory what if we analyzed government the same way we analyze markets public Choice Theory does exactly that and the results are unsettling founded by James Buchanan and Gordon tulk it applies economic thinking to politics challenging our romantic Notions about democracy and public service their key Insight politicians and bureaucrats aren't selfless public servants they're rational actors pursuing their own interests just like anyone else just as businesses seek profits politicians seek votes and bureaucrats seek larger budgets a congressman might know a policy is bad for the country but if it benefits their District guess how they'll vote this explains why good policies often fail to pass while bad ones persist like zombies that just won't die they identified a crucial concept called concentrated benefits and dispersed costs imagine a sugar tariff that costs consumers $20 each per year but give sugar producers an extra $20 million the cost is spread so thin that no individual consumer will bother fighting it while producers will Lobby hard to keep it this pattern repeats everywhere from Farm subsidies to trade restrictions it's why democracy often produces policies that harm the majority to benefit powerful minorities public Choice theorists also expose the myth of the public interest when a new regulation appears we assume it's to protect consumers but dig deeper and you often Find incumbent firms using government power to crush competition they showed how interest groups capture their Regulators turning Watchdogs into guard dogs for the industry but they don't just criticize they suggest Solutions constitutional rules can limit government's ability to play favorites Sunset Clauses can make regulations expire unless actively renewed competition between jurisdictions can check government power if your state tax is too much you can move their message democracy needs rules to make self-interest serve the common good right
