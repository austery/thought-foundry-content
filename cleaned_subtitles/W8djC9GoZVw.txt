I study adolescent brains for a living.
I also study their hormones,
social lives and mental health.
But first, I fell in love
with their brains.
Just look at this beautiful brain
of a 13-year-old girl.
Millions of connecting fibers.
It's like
a piece of art living inside our head.
Isn't that amazing?
Unfortunately, the story we tell
about adolescents isn't so amazing.
We have, as a society,
a long history of judging young people,
underestimating them.
We launch full-blown moral panics
with every trend they set
and technology they embrace.
That sets up bad expectations
where nobody wins.
So my mission is to use science
to help change society's narrative.
Think about it. 
Right now,
the story we tell about adolescents
is they're too anxious, too depressed,
obsessed with their phones,
and full of FOMO.
Rewind a couple decades.
Different story, equally unflattering.
They're too rebellious,
party animals,
maybe glued to their TVs or Ataris.
Why can't they be more like adults,
who, of course, have
exactly the right amount
of mental health issues
and other vices, right?
(Laughter)
Of course not.
But when it comes
to young people, it's a problem.
And we look for something to blame.
Is it their biology?
Maybe the latest technology?
I'm here to tell you
what the science says.
Adolescence isn't a problem to be solved.
It's a transformative period
of growth and opportunity,
and we all have a role to play
in helping them unlock its potential.
So let's dive into the science
of adolescence.
First things first, who is an adolescent?
I can't see very well.
I'm sure there are some in here.
You're probably thinking teenagers, right?
Thank you.
Actually, no.
Scientists say adolescent lasts
from about 10 to 25 years of age.
Why?
Because of how it's defined.
With a biological beginning in puberty
and a social ending
when they gain adult rights,
roles and responsibilities.
Let's start with a biological beginning
and something that probably
nobody in this room
is excited to talk about except me.
[Puberty]
(Laughter)
Puberty.
It's the best.
OK, let's take a quick guided tour.
Puberty is a natural process
everybody goes through
starting around age ten,
give or take a year,
when our brains release hormones
that ultimately change
a lot about our bodies.
We can't see what's going
on inside our bodies
but there are a lot
of outward puberty signs,
from skin, hair and voice changes
to body smells, shapes and size.
One puberty change
that might be a surprise is sleep.
Puberty kick starts a sleep phase delay,
which means an adolescent's
biological clock
doesn't make them feel tired
until one or two hours later than before.
Combine that with everything
going on in their social lives
and ta-da, you have
a new night owl in the family.
Now, if you spend any time
around middle schoolers,
you'll know the range
in these puberty signs is huge,
especially between boys and girls,
because on average,
girls start puberty about one
or two years earlier than boys.
So you can thank puberty
for so many awkward middle-school dances.
(Laughter)
When you see the signs
that puberty is starting,
something really important
to know is this:
going through puberty earlier
than your same-age, same-sex peers
is linked with more depression risk,
especially in girls.
But the surprising thing
we've learned about that is
it's not the hormones
increasing that risk.
It's how young people, girls,
feel their bodies are changing
compared to others.
That's because having your body
change so dramatically
changes how you feel about yourself,
and that matters for your mental health.
It also changes how society sees you.
One way this shows up
is in something called adultification.
When we see more grown-up looking bodies,
we treat them differently.
We have different expectations.
For example,
older boys assume early-maturing girls
are more interested in things like sex.
And adultification also happens
in our education and justice systems
where it's extra harmful.
The bigger picture here
is we love to blame hormones,
but biology matters less
than how young people see themselves
and how society sees them
during this stage of life.
That's actually a good thing.
We can't avoid hormone changes forever,
but we can make puberty a little easier
by combining greater awareness
of some of these puberty-related risks
and biases I just talked about
with open communication.
Look, if you can talk candidly
about puberty to a middle schooler,
you have set the foundation
for honest conversations,
not just about physical health,
but all kinds of important things to come.
Besides hormones,
another slice of adolescent biology
we misunderstand is their brains.
The idea that teenagers
have immature brains
and that's why they make
such bad decisions,
it's everywhere.
Where did that come from?
In the 1990s and 2000s
neuroscientists learned
that adolescent brain changes
don't really level out
until your mid-twenties.
This brain science was so striking
that it helped shape multiple
Supreme Court decisions,
most importantly, ending
the death penalty for minors.
Now we've basically --
yeah, applause for that.
(Applause)
Science that matters.
(Applause)
Now we've basically embraced the idea
that the adolescent brain
is still developing.
That's fantastic.
But ...
There's a risk that the same science
used to protect youth
can be misapplied to limit their rights,
like to vote or make their own
healthcare decisions.
So I have a really important
message to share.
Decades of research show
adolescents can make good decisions
about big things.
Around age 16,
their decision-making abilities
basically match those of adults
when they have the time
and space to think carefully.
It's interesting, right?
I just told you the adolescent brain
is still changing to the mid-20s,
but these key decision-making
abilities are online earlier.
So I think that it's time we reframe
our view of adolescent brains.
Don't think of them as immature.
They're perfectly suited
to meet the needs of young people.
Their brains prime them to explore,
learn quickly from rewards,
and be sensitive to social status.
It's easy to think
of those things as liabilities,
but that would be a mistake.
They're actually powerful assets
at a time in life when building identity,
independence and new relationships
outside the family really matters.
So ...
Let's acknowledge all the amazing
things that adolescents can do
and to be super concrete,
if you find that a young
person's right to vote
or make their own healthcare decisions
is on the ballot in the future,
don't forget, research shows
these are exactly the things
they can do well by age 16.
(Applause)
I thought I studied the biggest
and baddest monsters of adolescence,
and then smartphones entered the chat.
Forget biology.
The most explosive story right now
is that social media
is destroying this generation.
It's true that youth anxiety,
depression and suicide risk
are at alarming levels.
But are smartphones to blame?
Anyone want to know what the science says?
OK, you ready?
Social media use
is one of the least influential factors
shaping youth mental health.
I know, this isn't what we're being told.
And the kicker is, I know
it probably doesn’t feel true
if you parent or teach adolescents.
But here's the thing.
Science doesn't care
if something feels true.
(Laughter)
(Applause and cheers)
Let me tell you the facts.
Scientists have a way
of statistically summarizing information
across all the studies on a topic.
It’s called a meta-analysis.
Meta-analyses are great
because they can keep you
from getting science whiplash.
You know, when the headlines
ping-pong back and forth
with each new shiny study.
Anyways, there are a lot
of them on this topic
and they consistently show
really small effects.
Excessive time on social media
is linked with maybe
15 percent higher levels
of mental health problems
in youth, at most.
That's like nudging from 20 percent,
which is the current baseline risk
for adolescent depression,
up to 23 percent.
The effect is so small,
it almost gets lost in the noise.
And in fact, when studies do a good job
accounting for the many known risk factors
in adolescent depression,
that's exactly what happens.
The effect basically disappears.
This makes sense if social
media use is like a marker
of youth mental health problems,
a correlate and not the cause.
Now those other risk factors,
those should be on your list
because you have way more impact.
Take relationships.
Whether you're 16 or 60,
they matter for your mental health.
For example, youth who are bullied
have double the risk
of developing depression.
That's a way bigger effect.
But an adolescent
with high-quality friendships,
they can spend four
or five hours a day online,
and still have over a 90 percent chance
of great mental health and well-being.
If four to five hours a day
kind of freaks you out,
that's the current national average
for 13-to 19-year-olds.
What about families?
The good news is they can protect
against bad outcomes
from even the worst experiences,
including bullying.
But parent mental health problems
more than triple the risk
of adolescents developing them, too,
3.5 times greater risk.
I don't say this to blame parents.
My point is just that parents matter
way more than phones.
Look, as someone deeply invested
in the well-being of young people,
both as a scientist and as a mom,
I wish the answer were as simple
as shutting off the phones.
But the science is clear.
We won't be able to solve this
by focusing on social media alone.
In fact,
young people often turn online first
for mental health resources and support.
So what do we do?
Big system-level changes
are needed to fix this, no question.
But we're not powerless.
If you're worried
about youth mental health,
build their resilience.
Listen, provide support.
Help them learn
that feelings and failures
are a normal part of adolescence.
Because they're a normal part of life.
I love how this message is for all of us.
It's for parents, especially.
Even the best parents fail sometimes.
We have hard days and big feelings.
But too few of us get
the support that we need.
So if you're struggling
with your own mental health,
know that asking for help
makes you a great parent,
because one of the best predictors
of this generation's well-being
is the mental health of those
who care for them.
In other words, put your own
oxygen mask on first.
Alright.
(Applause)
Let's land this thing.
Adolescence last
from 10 to 25 years of age
when bodies, brains, relationships
and mental health are all changing.
But it's not the biological
or psychological changes
alone that define adolescence.
We do.
We are all in this together.
That means
we have to stop doom-shaming young people.
If we keep saying this generation
is being destroyed,
how can we expect them
to believe in their own potential?
(Applause)
Instead, we need to respect
their growing strengths,
create space for them to contribute
at home, at school and in the community.
Honestly, we need young people
just as much as they need
our love and support.
Their ability to adapt
to our rapidly-changing world,
it's a superpower.
It's time to change the narrative.
Adolescents,
they're not a problem to be solved.
They represent our brightest future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
