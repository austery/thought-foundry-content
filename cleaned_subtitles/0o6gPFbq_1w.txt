Adam Smith is regarded as the father of capitalism. In 1776, he published an inquiry into the wealth of nations, revolutionizing economic thought. Almost 250 years later, his ideas have shaped the economic system that dominates the world. But would he recognize his vision in today's practice? Let's see how Smith reacts to two of capitalism's most prominent champions. Remarkable what markets have built. In my day, I could scarcely imagine such prosperity. built it all myself. Nobody builds like Trump. We're expanding markets beyond Earth now to Mars and beyond. And how have you achieved such extraordinary wealth? Innovation, disruption, taking risks others won't. I understand your Tesla company received substantial government subsidies. Those were available to anyone innovating in clean energy. The government created market incentives and I responded efficiently. Curious. In my work, I noted that people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merrynt and diversion. But the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public. I worried about businesses seeking favors from government. I've gotten plenty of tax breaks for my buildings. That's just smart business. The government offers it, you take it. Yet you both criticize government intervention in markets. In my view, government should provide certain public works and institutions which it can never be for the interest of any individual or small number of individuals to erect and maintain. But today's government is inefficient and corrupt. Exactly. And I made a fortune in real estate without government help. My properties are magnificent. Trump Tower is probably the most successful building in New York. Mr. Trump, I understand your wealth derives substantially from land ownership and rents. I own the best properties, prime real estate, tremendous value. I wrote that landlords love to reap where they never sowed and often become wealthy in their sleep without working, thinking, or taking the least trouble. I believe the progress of society came from productive industry, not passive collection of rents. I built these buildings. I improve the land. I actually create things. My companies make revolutionary products. Indeed. Yet, I understand you've purchased existing companies rather than starting many of them and now work to eliminate competition. I warned that monopolies are a great enemy to good management. My companies create more competition. Look at Tesla. We've forced the entire auto industry to embrace electric vehicles. And I've created thousands of jobs with my properties. Beautiful jobs. The best jobs. Speaking of jobs, my employees work harder than anyone. They're paid well for their innovation. How do you compensate your workers? Market rates, sometimes with stock options. I advocated that high wages to workers were the foundation of national prosperity. No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. Workers today are paid what they're worth. The market decides. We need to reduce regulations that force artificial wage force. Yet, I argued the law should not be hostile to workers when they combine to raise wages, just as it shouldn't help them. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to raise it. Look, I've been very generous to my employees. Very generous. They love working for me. The free market is the ultimate arbiter. If workers feel underpaid, they can go elsewhere. Exactly. And another thing about capitalism, it rewards visionaries. People who can see what others can't. That's why we're successful. H I see. That's quite interesting. Adam Smith lived during the early days of industrial capitalism, observing small workshops and local markets where producers and consumers often knew each other personally. The invisible hand he described operated within communities where reputation mattered and relationships were direct. Smith's capitalism emerged from mercantalism where trade was heavily regulated by governments seeking to accumulate gold and silver. He advocated for freer markets but never envisioned the extreme concentration of wealth or corporate power we see today. For Smith, competition required many small producers, not a handful of dominant firms. Yes, today's free markets are anything but free. They involve government subsidies, regulatory credits, strategic bankruptcies, and tax loopholes that benefit insiders. But that observation alone doesn't tell us much about the systems evolution. The more fascinating question is, how has capitalism transformed into something Adam Smith would barely recognize? Smith lived in a world where information traveled at the speed of horses, where most people never ventured more than 20 m from their birthplace. The idea that you could order a product manufactured on another continent and receive it within days would have seemed like sorcery. Global supply chains, instantaneous electronic transactions, and multinational corporations operating across hundreds of jurisdictions weren't just undeveloped in Smith's time. They were unimaginable. Capitalism evolved because it had to. The industrial revolution created production capabilities that vastly exceeded local demand. New transportation technologies, steamships, railroads, eventually airplanes, made global trade increasingly practical. Digital technologies later accelerated these trends exponentially. This evolution solved problems Smith's version of capitalism never had to face. How do you coordinate production across continents? How do you mobilize the massive capital needed for modern infrastructure? How do you manage risk in a globally interconnected economy? The solutions, large corporations, stock markets, complex financial instruments, international trade agreements, created unprecedented prosperity, and lifted billions from subsistence living. Yet, they also produce second order effects. Extreme wealth concentration, environmental externalities, and economic power that transcends national boundaries. These aren't bugs in the system, they're features. A global economy of 8 billion people requires coordination mechanisms far beyond what Smith envisioned for local markets. However, these mechanisms have been increasingly captured by those who understand how to manipulate them. Today's economic elites don't just participate in markets, they shape them. They don't just follow regulations, they help write them. They don't just compete within systems, they design the systems themselves. The question isn't whether we should return to some mythical pure capitalism that never really existed. It's whether we can evolve our economic systems once again to address the challenges of our time, climate change, technological disruption, and the concentration of both wealth and power. Smith believed markets should serve human flourishing. Looking at today's system, would he recognize that foundational purpose? Or would he see a system that has optimized for profit at the expense of the broader human welfare he originally envisioned?
