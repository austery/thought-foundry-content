<p class="english-text">And it's all about.
It's all about.
It's all about Tracy.
It's all. About.
It's all about.
It's all about Joe.
How's that?
Hello, and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway and.
I'm Joe Weisenthal.
Joe, we were doing a Q&A this morning.
That's right.
It was a lot of fun.
Go on a live Q&A
and someone asked a question about whether
or not we're going to do more
health care episodes.
And we don't do enough. Do it.
No, we don't,
and there's a reason for that.
I personally am incredibly intimidated
by the US health care system.
I do not understand it. At all.
It is just a complete mystery to me.
But I was very happy to say in response
to that question that this same day.
That's right.
We're actually recording
a health care episode,
with someone that we've wanted to speak to
for for a long time.
I'm the same way in the sense that,
first of all, yes, I'm the same way, in
the sense that I really do not know much
about how the health care system works.
I don't even know where to begin
asking the right questions.
This is what you do.
You have to just start a random episode,
and that gives you
the germs of the next question,
the next episode, the next episode.
But there are so it seems so
big and sprawling, etc.
that what is the first question to ask?
So we just have to plunge right in
and just pick one, which we're doing now
and then maybe that will lead
to the string of health care episodes,
which we should have done a long time ago.
That's exactly right.
There's also a lot of new stuff
happening in health care at the moment,
and we've recorded an episode
on Chinese biotechs a little while ago
that was incredibly fascinating.
Definitely.
I'm very curious
to see what's going on on the U.S.
side of biotech investing.
And we do have another episode plan that's
sort of tangentially related to that.
But clearly there's a lot to talk about.
The other
very Odd Lots-y thing with this guest is
we like people who have interesting
career histories, right?
That's right.
How we, how they got to where they are
today is often
a very interesting question.
You know,
I have nothing against people
who just took the normal path, people
who just sort of, you know, went
to college and then they got their MBA.
And it's okay. You forgive them.
I forgive them.
That's really fine.
But it's also interesting to hear
about the people
who maybe walked in through the side door,
so to speak.
Absolutely.
So we do, in fact, have the perfect guest.
We have someone who has a lot of thoughts
on U.S.
health care
and who is also a biotech investor,
and also formerly the lead singer of,
Chester French.
So D.A. Wallach, welcome to the show.
Thanks so much for coming on.
Thanks for having me, guys.
I'm, I'm a Odd Lots junkie,
so this looks like going to the Grammys.
Amazing. Oh, did you ever win a Grammy?
No. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have.
I shouldn't have asked that.
Not. Not yet. Is not. Yet.
Not yet, not yet.
I love the piano
in the background by the way.
But I guess my first question should be,
can you talk to us about the through line
between being a musician and health care,
and how you and biotech,
and how you got into this space?
Because I think, you know, it's not
a natural transition, to say the least.
Yeah.
Well,
I'll tell you how I ended up doing this,
and then I'll try to connect them
theoretically, in some way
it might be a little tenuous.
I've basically had three careers
so far in my limited adult life.
I was a professional rock musician
with the band
that you mentioned for several years,
and then I kind of slipped
into the venture capital world
when I invested in Spotify.
That was 13 years ago,
and that was pretty much
the only company in the private markets
I was well-positioned to understand
as a musician.
And through the success of that,
I got turned on to how exciting
venture capital was.
Started doing other types of investments
across different industries was involved
in space Acts and Ripple
and a bunch of interesting other startups.
And then ultimately, a guy I knew started
an early stage health care company.
It was a telemedicine startup
called Doctor On Demand, and telemedicine
at the time was not a hot topic
because this is pre-COVID, right.
So we still primarily
went to the doctor in person.
And when I made that investment,
I started to learn more and more about our
health care system and was just blown away
by how screwed up and stupid it was.
And then that eventually evolved
into learning more about biotechnology
and the other subsectors of health care
that are critical to medicine.
And it's ended up being what I do
in terms of the connection between music
and any of this stuff.
There are a couple of ways
I can think about it.
One is I tell people now my job is like
being a record producer for scientists.
So there's a little bit of a parallel
there, but the other is that
I think there's a unique challenge
in music to combining art and commerce.
Yeah, and in health care,
there's a similar parallel challenge,
which is how do you combine
medicine and capitalism,
which don't naturally go together
very well.
Right. And I imagine yeah.
The, the, the producer,
analogy makes a ton of sense.
And you know, there are a lot of musicians
who are really brilliant
and really great musicians,
but for whatever reason,
the lightning doesn't strike
where they are or doesn't strike nearby
and they don't take off,
probably many brilliant scientists, etc..
But the paths from brilliant science
to commercial blockbuster can often,
I assume, be tricky or dispiriting.
In many ways, etc.
biotech specifically.
Of all the things in investing, biotech,
strikes me as this whole different world
than the rest of like, investing.
You know, when I think of like a software
company, it's like, oh, okay, well,
they've accumulated these clients
and their churn is low, etc..
Yeah.
This seems like a company
that has traction is going to grow
when it comes to biotech.
It's like,
okay, here's some patent on a sequence.
And maybe ten years from now
it'll get approved to something
that'll be a therapy.
It seems so much harder to figure out.
Like, what are the heuristics
that one would use to establish
this is a likely this science is likely
going to turn into a business.
Oh, that's that's absolutely true.
I it's like a completely different
paradigm as an investor.
I think the typical biotech company
is like a bag of options.
And each one of the drugs
that the company is working on in success
could be worth billions of dollars,
but that's ten years away, often minimum.
And so you're trying to price things
based on their ultimate
potential scale
times, their probability of succeeding.
And unfortunately, the base rates in terms
of probability of success are very low.
So if you take small molecules,
which is one major area of drugs,
the base case is like a 5% probability
of success
from the original idea
to an FDA approval and a marketed drug.
Now you get to a higher sort of prior
probability with, antibodies
or so-called biologics,
other classes of drugs
that are intrinsically more likely to work
than small molecules.
But still, in every case, you're dealing
with very low probabilities of success.
And the entire challenge
is a biotech investors.
How do you manage
those low probability events and build
portfolios that are still likely
to make money, despite the fact
that each individual project
is relatively unlikely to work?
I'd say in tech,
there's this well-described kind of power
law distribution of winners and losers,
which is to say,
a very small number of companies
make all the money and pay
for the huge number of losers in biotech.
That's still true to a degree, but
the magnitudes of the winners are lower.
And so a really good biotech investor
probably has a lower,
sorry, a higher batting average
than the typical tech investor.
But the winds are not as big.
So one thing I'm really curious about
is how you source potential investments
and how you find, you know,
you use the analogy of the record
producer,
how you find talent in the space
or how the talent kind of finds you
and whether or not it's different
from, again, the sort of soft where
or tech space that we usually talk about
when it comes to venture capital.
You know, when I started doing venture
investing, there was,
like I said, 12, 13 years ago,
it was obviously a well-established part
of the capital markets.
But, you know, I cold emailed
Brian Armstrong from Coinbase
and was meeting with them two days later.
And it's hard to overstate
how much money has rushed in
over the past decade.
So what went from being an established
but still kind of marginal part
of the capital markets
is now all anyone thinks or talks about.
Yeah.
And so in biotech,
what I found getting into this area
was that it was more like that
venture market I had encountered.
There was a scarcity of capital
relative to the capital,
the caliber of ideas that were out there.
And so I'd say deal sourcing
is much easier in a sense,
because there's less money chasing.
Yeah, huge number of good ideas.
And those ideas, by and large,
do come out of our university
and research infrastructure
here in America.
The same is also true
in other parts of the world,
in Europe, China, India and so forth.
But it's really the translation
of those academic concepts into products
that could make money.
That is the challenge.
That's the so-called valley of death
that people
sometimes talk about in our industry.
Yeah, there are just an immense number
of cool ideas
if you go into any university
in our country,
but such a small number of them
is ever going to cross that chasm.
And part of that is that the expertise
and the personnel required to do that
translational work
is not the same expertise
that is required to do
the inventing in the first place.
And so that is really what
the large pharmaceutical companies
have a specialized expertise,
and they train people
in this translational work.
How do you go from early science
to real products?
Right.
When I go to like a typical venture
capitalist website
or I see their Twitter bio or something
like that, it'll say like,
we met great founders and I'm like,
thanks, that's very helpful because
that distinguishes you from the venture
capitalists who backed crappy founders.
So I'm glad I'm going to invest
with you instead.
What's the biotech equivalent?
What's the cliche in your industry
that every VC says that ostensibly
distinguishes them from all the others?
Well, I'm not sure what the VCs say.
I mean, they are kind of commoditized
in the sense that most of the firms
look pretty similar.
They employ 30 PhDs and physicians,
and the value of those people
is that they can make sense
of the information that you have
to process
to invest intelligently in this space.
In terms of what distinguishes
the founders that they like to look at,
I'd say again, it's kind of the inverse
of what you find in tech.
There's a real premium on, quote,
gray hair in the biotech industry,
because the only way to learn this stuff
is to do it over and over again.
And they have had a lot of failures.
And if you think about a software company,
the tropes you are familiar with,
are you know, fail fast, pivot.
Right.
You know, like you launch
something that doesn't work.
You tweak the product design,
you go into a different market,
you can adapt very readily to the market.
In biotech, if you choose to embark upon
a clinical program,
you're in for 30 or 40 million bucks.
That's not an easy door
to walk back out of.
Yeah.
And so there's a real premium on people
with experience who have done it
multiple times.
That is a little bit
at odds in recent years with a movement
that people have, I think, awkwardly
dubbed tech bio instead of biotech.
And really,
these are Silicon Valley tech investors,
not totally unlike myself,
who have gotten into biotech.
And they think that what's about to change
is it's going to go
the way of the tech industry,
and the next big companies
are going to be started by really clever
21 year olds coming out of Stanford.
And that hypothesis people
have been testing now for a few years.
I'd say it's a little too early to,
issue a verdict is that that's
never really been our theory.
Is that hypothesis just predicated on AI
coming in and making,
you know, drug development easier?
Is that all it is?
There's a lot of that.
I'd say there are two parts of it.
One of it is
maybe more substantive than that.
This is a little nuanced.
I know of lots of people like nuance.
We love it.
One of the big transformations that
really gave rise to the biotech industry.
And when I use that term biotech,
I'm distinguishing it from big pharma.
So biotech really just means
small drug companies.
Many of them are public.
What really gave rise to
that industry was the big
pharma is at the behest of Wall Street
Deprioritized early stage research,
because Wall Street
said you're wasting a lot of money on this
really risky early stage discovery work.
What we would rather you did
was just let all these crazy guys
like de finance startups,
and once they work, just by then,
you know
you're going to pay a higher price,
but you won't be burning all this money
on early stuff.
What that led to was an exodus
of very specialized technical experts
from the pharma companies,
and it created the so-called CRO, or
contract research organization ecosystem.
So you now, as a consequence of that,
for the past
20 years have had a very proficient,
environment, full of,
contract organizations
that you can hire as a little company
to outsource a lot of work
that you couldn't in the past.
So the best analogy to tat to tech
would be sort of like virtual servers
or cloud infrastructure, like,
you know, to have a startup,
you used to have
all these servers in your office
and then at some point
you didn't need that.
So the cost of new company
formation went way down.
So part of the argument for younger,
more agile founders has been, look,
we got this whole new kind
of infrastructure
through which they can build companies
in a really agile way.
The other argument, you know, exactly to
your question is around AI.
And that theory is basically, look,
these old people don't understand AI.
Let's get some young Silicon Valley
computer science types to do this.
And they're going to show them
how it's done.
I feel like that's probably.
A phenomenon that goes beyond biotech,
where there's
this fantasy
and maybe in some cases it's even correct.
But there is this fantasy
that every industry out there
must be dominated by old dinosaurs
who don't know how to use tech,
and who have been doing something
the same way forever.
And so steer 2025.
It must be out of date by now,
and they haven't figured this out.
And if we could just cough,
cough journalism.
Yeah, right.
If we could just hire whiz kids,
then we could reinvent the industry
from first principles and just do a much
better job than the legacy things.
And I think whether it's health care
or whether it's industrial stuff
that we see Silicon Valley getting excited
about right now, it just feels like
the default assumption
must be that the veterans are doing
something wrong, and with pure brainpower,
we can figure out what that thing is.
I think that
is a reasonable characterization
of what people say.
Yeah, in a lot of different places.
And I don't think it's true in my sector.
But as with every conversation about AI,
the challenge is balancing
two ideas that can be true
at the same time, but seem contradictory.
And one is that this stuff is amazing.
And it is, particularly in life sciences,
responsible for some true breakthroughs
like the breakthrough
that won Demis Hassabis at DeepMind,
the Nobel Prize last year with,
AlphaFold, which was this amazing
discovery they made that use in machine
learning models.
You could solve a problem
that had gone unsolved for decades,
which was can you predict
from the sequence of a proteins
amino acids what three dimensional shape
a protein is going to take
in a physical environment
and I just threw around
a bunch of terms of art.
But this is fundamental
to drug development and drug discovery.
So it's like on the one hand,
you can't deny these breakthroughs
that we're experiencing.
You can't deny that
when you talk to Gemini, it's staggering
what this thing can do.
I mean, I'm sitting there all day
having it teach me about asset
pricing models
or whatever else I'm interested in.
But at the same time,
the religious movement
that is powering all of the investment
and a lot of the entrepreneurship here
across industries is full of hot air
and is making claims
that are preposterous.
Unless you are a zealot.
Just real quickly.
If we'd been having this conversation
in a month ago,
would you have said Gemini?
Or would you have said ChatGPT?
Because I switched from Chegg,
we did a Gemini in the last month,
and I'm just curious whether you're
what you would have said a month ago.
A month ago, I was using all of them.
Now I'm only using Gemini.
It's interesting.
All right, good data point. Okay,
talk to us about the choke points
when it comes to new drug development,
because I imagine, okay, maybe
AI machine learning can speed up
some of the research or discovery process,
but even after that, you have to go
through these really long clinical trials
that in some cases take decades.
What what are the major,
I guess, like stumbling blocks
to getting something to the market?
Your question held the answer.
So the the process of taking a drug
from idea to the market,
you can think of as a funnel
to just use a visual analogy
and into the top of the funnel go all the
millions of ideas that people have.
And then as you go down the funnel,
you are spending progressively
more and more and more money
to prove two things.
The first is that the drug is safe
and won't harm
or kill people,
and the second is that the drug works
and it actually modifies
the disease that you're trying to treat.
And the tragedy of our moment
is that the only way to figure out
if drugs are safe and effective
is to try them in human beings,
living, breathing human beings.
And that is extraordinarily time consuming
and incredibly expensive financially.
So I wish for the day
when AI is able to fully simulate
an accurate human in the computer,
and we don't need to do clinical trials
on real people.
But until that moment, the vast
majority of the cost and expense and time
that is involved in drug discovery
remains with us.
So most of the AI technologies
that people are excited about really
would have the effect of putting more
good ideas into the top of the funnel.
But unfortunately,
that doesn't solve a problem that we have.
We already are drowning in good ideas,
and the issue is exactly the choke point
or bottleneck that you're referring to.
This is really I
there's actually two questions.
First of all, is there low hanging fruit
from a regulatory side
to accelerate that process?
People like to fathom, oh,
the FDA must be super.
There's another area
people will say, well,
the FDA must be super slow and do things
one way we could speed this up.
I don't know, is there somewhere
along the process where like
from a regulatory standpoint
or some other thing that the either
the cost of the timelines could shrink
or is it mostly still just the reality of
we have to test these things on humans,
and that's costly and it takes time.
Well, we don't need to do anything.
We could have no FDA. Sure.
And anyone who has a good drug idea
just launches it commercially.
And if some people die from that
and it doesn't do anything, that's fine.
By the way, that's
kind of like the supplement industry.
Yeah. Peptide. Deal with it.
Milton Friedman
famously thought that the FDA
should only assess the safety of drugs.
Yeah, and if a drug was proven safe,
put it on the market
and let the market dictate
whether people determine
they should pay for it
based on their lived experience
with whether it works or not.
Now, I just personally prefer
to live in a world
where
if I've got something that's going wrong,
I can more or less trust that the product
my doctor gives me
has been proven safe and effective,
and that reflects that.
We have today a pretty high bar
for approving drugs,
but we could certainly lower that bar.
We could change the type of data
that the FDA requires.
And that's what's happening in China.
By the way, I know you mentioned this
other episode you did with my friend Tim.
In China, the regulatory environment
has been moving pretty rapidly,
and they've done that deliberately
because they want to be more productive,
they want to approve more drugs,
and they're trying to strike that balance
between being prolific and, holding things
to a high standard at the same time.
So, you know, we'll see.
And I just want to
follow up on one other thing you said,
because I think it seems important,
someone like Sam Altman,
when he talks about the promise of AI
a lot of it is like, oh, we could find
the next drug that cures cancer.
In the meantime,
we're going to make the sort of slot
machine that makes weird videos, etc.
but really, we're trying to find
these wonder drugs in the long term.
But for what?
It sounds like you said, candidates
are not where the shortage is like.
The issue is not that we lack
a sufficiently
a number of sufficiently promising
molecule combinations.
The scarcity is not on that at that point.
That's my view.
I mean, I'll steal, man.
The other argument, the other thing,
it would be, well, look, DEA,
you said ten minutes ago that these drugs
have a 5% probability
of working from the outset.
You know, if we had better
predictive models that told us certain
candidates were much more likely to work
than others, wouldn't that be great?
And my rejoinder to that is, yes, but
how would we know that we've done that?
Meaning, if the three of us tomorrow
invented a black box
that produce drug candidate concepts,
and we were certain
that our model doubled the prior
probability from 5% to 10%,
that would be a truly revolutionary
innovation on our part.
But how many candidates from that model
would we need to take
all the way to an approval?
Before we had statistically demonstrated
that we,
in fact increased the rate of of success?
Yeah.
So people may have already cracked
that code.
You know,
Google may have already cracked the code.
Sam Altman may have cracked that code,
but someone's going to need to spend $30
billion developing the drug ideas he has
before we know whether he's done that.
And until that money is spent,
it's pure conjecture and salesmanship.
How are you actually evaluating
opportunities in the US against China
competition?
Because, you know, if clinical trials
are the major choke point
and if China seems to be trying
to make that process
as efficient as possible, it seems like
maybe they have an advantage.
I mean, they definitely have an advantage.
And if I had to make a bet today
on our sector, it would be that
China is going to be the big story
over the next decade or two.
I think it's a fundamental structural
shift in the global biotechnology market.
And there are advantages are multiple.
I mean, their advantages are regulatory.
They relate to the personnel.
We have lost an amazing amount of talent
who was educated here
in our graduate schools
and now has gone back to China.
And furthermore, they are,
able to develop things in the clinic
which is to say, do clinical trials
a lot faster and at a much higher volume
than our infrastructure can handle.
So they've got big advantages.
Now, how do I think about investing
in the US versus China?
I don't that much
because I don't speak Mandarin.
And I think it would be really difficult
for me to invest in China today.
But increasingly, companies in the U.S.
are starting to outsource
certain parts of the research process
to Chinese companies.
And increasingly,
they're going to outsource parts
of the clinical development process,
the clinical trials to China,
that's going to make a huge impact
on the industry.
Yeah. This was actually my next question.
I guess how translatable is a successful
clinical trial
in China to a market like the US?
3 or 4 years ago, what
both investors and regulators in
the US would have told you
was that it's not that translatable
because they're liars
and they make up all the data
and it's rampant with fraud.
And there may have been
some truth to that,
but I think there was also
a good amount of racism.
And what sort of woke
everyone up in the past couple of years
was that some very significant
clinical trials were done in China.
People were suspicious of the data.
Then they replicated those trials
in Europe or the United States
and got very similar data.
And folks thought, whoa,
maybe they're not so bad at this.
So I think decreasingly people
are skeptical.
And which said, less awkwardly,
people are trusting more and more
what's coming out of China.
And it's incumbent upon the Chinese,
to the extent that they want
this to be a major strategy to continue,
enhancing people's trust in the quality
of their work in their data.
If they can do that,
I think it's a global industry.
A lot of the companies are multinationals.
They don't care if the drug comes
out of the U.S. or comes out of China.
This isn't really
a question about private or VC stage
investing per se,
but about biotech more broadly.
You know, there is some sickos out there
on the internet who like trade by trade,
retail traders
who trade up biotech stocks.
And again, this is I've never I've talked
you know, I've covered the stock market
for a long time in various ways.
I've never spent any time really getting
to know a publicly traded biotech stock.
Is are you insane
to try to invest in biotech?
If you don't have a PhD level
understanding of biology, like,
can anyone have alpha in this industry
if they don't actually know
science?
I think it's tough.
Yeah, it seems very tough to me.
Yeah. I mean, here's the thing.
What's really interesting about biotech
in the public markets is it's
abundantly clear that active investors
can have alpha in biotech.
Whereas as you guys know
that is not clear.
Right.
And the rest of the public
equity landscape.
And so whereas there is very little
if not negative persistence of performance
among active equity managers
broadly in biotech,
you have a small number of firms that have
been doing great for sometimes decades.
And they all have real
science expertise on staff.
They do.
And, you know, the dynamic
between them and the generalists,
so to speak,
is that they do a lot of very detailed
work to make sense of the information
you need to process,
to value these companies and to assess
their probability of success.
And then the generalists often follow
those specialists into these names
and the fortunes of the industry
in these cycles,
like we're coming out of a four year
Great Depression for biotech,
I should just mention
a lot of those fortunes
ride on the sector
rotations of the generalists.
So the specialists have to stick
with biotech because that's what they do.
But whether or not companies can IPO,
whether or not companies
can fund their next clinical trial
is largely a function of
whether the generalists are in the sector
at that moment or not.
And we're just in the midst of the early
rotation of generalists back into biotech.
With the biotech investing downturn,
was that just a function
of higher interest rates,
or was something else going on?
It was a confluence of everything
that could go wrong.
At the same time,
it was higher interest rates,
which really punished these biotech stocks
relative to other companies because,
you know, no cash flows for ten years
and then a big bowl of some money.
So these companies are very sensitive
to discount rates.
Yeah.
Add to that
this dynamic where the generalists
had gotten out of the sector
that ultimately is fatal.
And then, consider the fact
that we had such a comedown
after the sugar high of Covid.
So obviously, during Covid,
there was this moment of clarity
where everyone for a second recognized
that this sector is for each of us
at some point in our lives,
the most important thing
that happens in the global economy,
like without the biotech industry,
you know, we're all in trouble.
And we kind of
go through life pretending like we're
never going to need this industry.
And then you get cancer
or your dad gets cancer.
Yeah, your kid gets some rare disease,
and you go,
Holy cow,
I wish I'd thought about this before.
Maybe all these people who are doing this
with their lives are not evil
bloodsuckers
who Bernie Sanders needs to take down.
And, you know, that is,
I think part of what dawned on people
during Covid
when we all were vulnerable
and we all were yearning for a solution.
Talk a little bit more about, I guess, the
the financial incentives
about actually developing new drugs.
So we we all know the story of
if you're based in the US,
you can go to Mexico or wherever else
and buy the same medicine
for like five bucks as opposed to $500
or perhaps even more in the US.
And the argument for
that seems to be that, well,
you know, the big pharma companies
need to be rewarded
for all the research and the effort
and the risk that they actually take on.
And for some reason, the US seems to be
the designated place to do that.
But like, why?
Why is my question why U.S drug pricing?
Well, the the big bounty
for a drug development
company is the United States market.
And that's partly because we as a society
have decided that we want
all the new most advanced drugs.
We want them first
and we don't want to deny them to people
who could benefit from them.
Now the price we pay for those commitments
is that our drug prices are higher
than the prices in other countries.
And the reason their prices are lower
is because their governments
choose which drugs
their people will have access to,
and they make those choices and then
negotiate the prices with the companies.
And they basically will say to Pfizer
or AstraZeneca,
look,
if you want your drug sold here in Japan,
you're going to take the price
that we give you.
And then the pharma company decides
whether they want to accept that deal
or not.
Now, the United States absolutely could
choose as a civilization to negotiate.
In that same manner, our government
could make the choice for us as to exactly
what we're willing to pay for every drug
there would be two consequences to that.
One is that we would
go without certain drugs.
The second
is that a lot of drugs would not even
be developed in the first place,
because the total pool of profits
available to drug companies
would be much smaller.
And so I don't know that
there's any perfect answer
to how much pharmaceutical innovation
we should have in the world.
We get to choose how much innovation
we want to occur and the way we choose.
That is by determining
the size of that bounty that exists.
How big is the profit pool?
We want to allow for innovative drug
development, and a lot of that is driven
by our patent law.
Remember, a patent in
this industry is a legalized monopoly.
So we give drug companies a legal monopoly
for a limited period of time.
And that dictates how much money
they're able to make off of a new drug.
We could shorten the patent life
and that would reduce the profit pool,
you'd have less drug development.
We could remove the patent life.
You could have a permanent monopoly.
And believe me, the industry would
double or triple overnight.
So it's a choice we have to make
and it's a civic choice.
You mentioned the Bernie Sanders
of the world who, they look at the profits
of drug companies,
they look at the prices of drugs. And,
you know, perhaps if they got their way,
there would be less investment
in drug discovery instead of drug at all,
maybe less profit going back to Covid.
However, there was also the backlash
on the other side,
essentially
just this deep skepticism towards
the premise of pharma and that
what are these scientists doing?
And why don't they tell you
about this route
that people have used for thousands
of years that cured these diseases
that they don't want you to know about,
so that they can sell your stuff?
Talk to us about like,
just the sort of political environment
investing in biotech
in a political environment
or a growing number of people, frankly,
seem to distrust
the promise of scientific expertise.
Look, it's tough, and
some of the blame certainly belongs
with the scientific community,
because, you know,
to the extent that, say, in the early days
of Covid, communication
with the public about, say,
the value of masks was not clear
and it was maybe even misleading.
Yeah, some of the presentation of data
regarding the efficacy of the vaccines
was not transparent.
And that eroded the public's
trust in a very understandable way.
Now, I'm
no apologist for medicine or science
because I don't think these are privileged
priesthoods.
I think every person should be able
to be engaged
in and understand science and medicine.
And unfortunately,
the entire history of medicine
began with medical science
as total witchcraft and sorcery.
So if you go back to antiquity,
the first people
calling themselves
doctors objectively understood nothing.
Yeah.
So this was pure sophistry
from the beginning.
And we are on this long journey
through
which medicine is going from total B.S.
and witchcraft
to slowly turning into a real science,
something that deserves to be called
science.
Medicine is filled with common practices
that are not rigorously based on evidence,
and that is symptomatic of where we are
in that journey that I'm describing.
So I'm an advocate for medicine
becoming always more and more scientific.
I believe that scientific policymakers,
scientists and academia
need to do a much better job
communicating transparently,
and that's the only way to engender
that kind of trust.
You're talking about show,
and the trust is critical
because it is what gives permission
to this industry's existence.
We talk more about, I guess, autonomy
when it comes to medical decisions,
because this is, you know, a big culture
shock of non-Americans who come to the US
is drug adverts on TV where they,
you know, here's this great drug,
and then they read off all the risk
factors really, really quickly.
And one of the risks is always death
or severe brain damage or something.
Suicidal tendencies.
Yeah.
And I'm always like, again,
I've never asked
for a drug that I've seen on TV.
I do remember when I,
when I first came to the US as an adult,
I went to get a prescription.
I found a new doctor to do that.
And I said I needed this thing.
And the doctor was like, oh, well,
we have to run all these medical tests
before we can give you that.
And it ended up in a big argument
with my insurance provider.
And I remember
talking to people about that,
and they were like, well,
you should have pushed back
against the doctor about the testing.
And I was like, what do I know?
I just do what the doctor tells me, right?
How much, say, should people?
Actually, it sounds weird,
but you know, given the lack of experience
and given the way other systems
work, around the world,
how much safe should people
have in their own medical treatment?
I think
ultimately they should have almost
all of the say it's your body.
Ultimately,
you have to make the best decision
you can make, and you should regard
physicians, nurses, others in the system
as consultants
who support you in making wise decisions.
The one caveat there, however,
is that we do socialize
a lot of our medical costs.
And in many other countries,
they completely socialized medical costs.
And to the extent that you want
the rest of us to pay
for your medical care, I do believe
we need to have some standards around
what it's appropriate to pay for.
Yeah.
I mean, at the moment
it seems like most of those decisions
are left up to the insurers,
which again, in other places in the world,
it would be left up to, to the governments
to make those decisions.
Are insurers
the sort of another limiting factor here?
I believe they are.
I believe the private insurance industry
adds zero value to the United States
health care system, almost,
that it may slightly overstate it,
but it's close to zero in my book.
And I really don't believe
insurance companies ought to be the ones
making decisions
about what medical care is appropriate.
I noticed there in the video
you have a really nice looking microphone.
Is that like a is that a,
is that a musical?
Is that a microphone for recording music?
Yeah, this is
this is the one I, this is one I sing on.
It's first of all, you sound good,
but it also looks a lot cooler
than the typical microphone
that are, that are guests.
Do you, do you are you still
are you still playing much music?
I do, but but thankfully, now it's
just for fun, not for money,
which is a much more comfortable place
for it to live in my life.
Are you, do you think at all about,
AI generated music
and, the effect that that's going to have
on musicians this month?
I feel like a lot of musicians, like
the ones that I follow on Instagram.
I would say there's
a lot of anxiety about this.
There is anxiety.
And look, I mean, it's really hard
to make a living as a musician.
Yeah.
Now it's always been really hard and,
you know, I can't imagine what the
lifestyle was of a lute player and George
the second Royal Court or something.
But, you know, it's a tough business
and it is scary
when new technology comes on the scene.
That might change the way
you make money as an artist.
I lived through that with Spotify.
People were terrified of it and, you know,
fortunately, what it did over time.
They should have all done
what you did, would get long Spotify
and then hedge their own risk to it,
but keep going on the.
Spot.
Spotify by multiples
increased the total revenue
of the recorded music business,
which was the goal.
So mission accomplished. Now
look, I is going to make music.
And I think like all creative people,
like journalists, like investors,
everyone is going to think about
how they can use it to be more effective,
have more leverage, have a cooler output.
I mean, I have very little doubt
that artists are going to do
unbelieve cool and original stuff
with AI tools, and it's already happening.
And for whatever reason,
I have very little trepidation
that they're going
to be put out of business,
because I think ultimately music
is communication.
Real quickly on that.
When you talk about like doing
unbelievably cool things with music.
So I see in the background
you have a piano for example.
And one of the things
when I think about AI music is
and actually I think like, for example,
the founder of sumo
and some of these other AI,
music companies I've talked about,
this is like,
well, music, learning to play instruments
is really hard.
And therefore can we separate in some way
the craft of music,
the hours that someone has to spend
just doing scales on the piano
before they can compose something?
Maybe you could. What?
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could just have amazing, beautiful
piano sonatas without ever having had
put in those thousands of hours?
You know, Mary had a little lamb
and then so forth.
But it does raise the question to my mind
of whether one can create
great art
if they never had to learn the craft.
I think
the nuance with which one can
communicate through music
is a function
of how many options you perceive.
Okay?
In other words,
if you know the piano inside out,
you're aware of so many creative
choices at your disposal at any moment.
And if your ability to express yourself
is squeezed
down to what you can put
into a natural language prompt.
Yes. Now those musical ideas are having
to pass through the medium of language
right to be realized,
and that inherently erodes
the resolution and the expansiveness
with which you can express yourself.
Yeah, I feel like there's a danger here
that you go off on a big orality tangent
and whether ideas can exist without words
and things like that.
No, but I do think this is this,
that answer very insightful.
Like,
can you actually create great piano music
if you don't know the limits
of what the piano can do?
And if you're only trying to describe
in language, make this beautiful sonata.
I think that's very tough.
And I thought that answer made a lesson.
Da. We're going to have to wrap it up
soon.
I have one last question,
and I'm going to kind of I'm
going to put you on the spot.
Can you can you sing a little Odd Lots song
for us? like three bars of an Odd Lots Song?
I don't care if you generate it
with, you know, I guess Gemini now,
but if you think you could.
Let's see. I mean.
Oh, wow.
I'm going to turn this on.
Let's see. Here.
Oh, this is really cool. Yeah.
If you aren't watching the video.
So he's moving his microphone.
He's moving his microphone to his keyboard
okay.
Can you see me. Yeah. Yeah.
All right. Yeah.
Go for it. I'm in through here.
Okay.
We're going to try.
And it's all about.
It's all about.
It's all about Tracy.
It's all about.
It's all about.
It's all about Joe.
How's that.
Feel? Pretty good. You have.
You have a great voice. Yeah. It is.
If you ever want to compose
an outro song for us.
Yeah, something like that.
I would love to. I'm.
I am the composer of 2 or 3 podcasts.
Theme song.
Oh, and, I have to say, I love your guys.
Thank you.
It gets
me excited
that I got to end on this for you guys.
You know, in high school,
the reason I got into
investing in high school,
I was an economics nerd.
Oh, yeah, I. Heard.
I heard that you actually wrote, like,
some,
a paper that won, like, a prize
from the fed or something like that.
The Federal Reserve
had this nerd competition,
and they sponsored called Fed Challenge
and captain
of my high school team one year,
and we got to DC and we we saw
Greenspan walk out with his wise
and face and hands and anyways,
if I had had odd lots to listen to in high
school, man, I would have been in heaven
because you guys touched on
so much interesting stuff.
And this just has to be
the most exciting thing for young people
to, experience in order to get turned on
to business and economics and finance
and recognize these aren't just boring,
that's, you know, staid topics.
They're fascinating.
Now, thank you for saying that.
I really appreciate it. And also,
thank you for singing for us.
I think that was an Odd Lots first
  that was a first. Yeah.
So you're well on the spot.
I know we've had, moral hazard. Yeah.
Country singing economist on before
but that was fantastic.
D.A. Wallach,
thank you so much for coming on the show.
Really appreciate you guys.
Thanks for having me.
That was really interesting, Jeff.
That was super fun. He was great.
He's also pretty good at, you know,
I know again, he said it was tenuous,
but the through line from music to biotech
kind of makes sense.
I think it makes a lot of sense in the
especially the fact that,
you know, these are these are all startup
investing, as we know.
You know, there's there's this power
law phenomenon where one of your 20
portfolio companies
is going to make all the money.
Yeah, the lottery ticket.
But, you know, like biotech is like
lottery ticket to lottery tickets.
There's so much success, uncertainty.
Lottery with lower payouts.
There's lower payouts. There's
so much success, uncertainty.
There's so much time that elapses between
the initial work and where you have
see if there's any signals of traction.
It does feel a lot like the uncertainty
that exists in the music industry
and selecting like,
which of these 100 bands
that all sound great
and they're all really talented, actually
has what it takes to be a commercial hit.
A lot of parallels. Yeah.
I thought the the dinosaur bias point
was an interesting one as well
because you can imagine, like again,
to the timeline point,
you kind of have to be old to have
any success in the industry historically,
just because it can take, you know, a
decade to get a particular drug to market.
So you don't have that much opportunity
to have, you know, those wins
unless you get old.
And there's no shortage.
There's no, you know, there may be
regulatory things that can be done.
But fundamentally, if you want to know
whether something works
and if you want to know whether this drug
is going to kill people who take it or not
and whether it's safe or not,
there is no substitute for doing a test
and seeing what, what happens.
And to to your point
or to your observation
about the dinosaurs, like,
I do think that lots of people
have this fantasy that anytime
there's a legacy industry of any sort,
that if you just got 21 year olds
from Stanford in the same room, you gave.
Them a garage and workout.
Garage, that they would do it a lot
better than the veterans.
That was the DOGE premise.
And, DOGE doesn't exist anymore. So. Yeah.
All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.

### 生物技术投资的独特范式：风险与回报

D.A. Wallach 强调，生物技术（Biotech）投资与软件或科技投资有着本质的区别。科技公司通常可以通过客户积累、低客户流失率等指标来衡量其发展势头。然而，生物技术公司的情况则截然不同。其核心价值往往体现在一项专利或一项潜在的治疗方法上，而这些可能需要十年或更长时间才能获得美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）的批准并成为上市药物。因此，生物技术投资的评估模型更像是对一系列“期权”（options）进行定价，即评估每种药物的潜在市场规模乘以其成功的概率。不幸的是，这些成功的概率通常非常低。例如，对于小分子药物（small molecules），从最初的想法到最终获得 FDA 批准并上市，成功率可能只有 5%。虽然像抗体或生物制剂（biologics）这类药物的成功率会稍高，但整体而言，生物技术投资始终伴随着极低的成功概率。

<p class="english-text">But I guess my first question should be,
can you talk to us about the through line
between being a musician and health care,
and how you and biotech,
and how you got into this space?
Because I think, you know, it's not
a natural transition, to say the least.
Yeah.
Well,
I'll tell you how I ended up doing this,
and then I'll try to connect them
theoretically, in some way
it might be a little tenuous.
I've basically had three careers
so far in my limited adult life.
I was a professional rock musician
with the band
that you mentioned for several years,
and then I kind of slipped
into the venture capital world
when I invested in Spotify.
That was 13 years ago,
and that was pretty much
the only company in the private markets
I was well-positioned to understand
as a musician.
And through the success of that,
I got turned on to how exciting
venture capital was.
Started doing other types of investments
across different industries was involved
in space Acts and Ripple
and a bunch of interesting other startups.
And then ultimately, a guy I knew started
an early stage health care company.
It was a telemedicine startup
called Doctor On Demand, and telemedicine
at the time was not a hot topic
because this is pre-COVID, right.
So we still primarily
went to the doctor in person.
And when I made that investment,
I started to learn more and more about our
health care system and was just blown away
by how screwed up and stupid it was.
And then that eventually evolved
into learning more about biotechnology
and the other subsectors of health care
that are critical to medicine.
And it's ended up being what I do
in terms of the connection between music
and any of this stuff.
There are a couple of ways
I can think about it.
One is I tell people now my job is like
being a record producer for scientists.
So there's a little bit of a parallel
there, but the other is that
I think there's a unique challenge
in music to combining art and commerce.
Yeah, and in health care,
there's a similar parallel challenge,
which is how do you combine
medicine and capitalism,
which don't naturally go together
very well.
Right. And I imagine yeah.
The, the, the producer,
analogy makes a ton of sense.
And you know, there are a lot of musicians
who are really brilliant
and really great musicians,
but for whatever reason,
the lightning doesn't strike
where they are or doesn't strike nearby
and they don't take off,
probably many brilliant scientists, etc..
But the paths from brilliant science
to commercial blockbuster can often,
I assume, be tricky or dispiriting.
In many ways, etc.
biotech specifically.
Of all the things in investing, biotech,
strikes me as this whole different world
than the rest of like, investing.
You know, when I think of like a software
company, it's like, oh, okay, well,
they've accumulated these clients
and their churn is low, etc..
Yeah.
This seems like a company
that has traction is going to grow
when it comes to biotech.
It's like,
okay, here's some patent on a sequence.
And maybe ten years from now
it'll get approved to something
that'll be a therapy.
It seems so much harder to figure out.
Like, what are the heuristics
that one would use to establish
this is a likely this science is likely
going to turn into a business.
Oh, that's that's absolutely true.
I it's like a completely different
paradigm as an investor.
I think the typical biotech company
is like a bag of options.
And each one of the drugs
that the company is working on in success
could be worth billions of dollars,
but that's ten years away, often minimum.
And so you're trying to price things
based on their ultimate
potential scale
times, their probability of succeeding.
And unfortunately, the base rates in terms
of probability of success are very low.
So if you take small molecules,
which is one major area of drugs,
the base case is like a 5% probability
of success
from the original idea
to an FDA approval and a marketed drug.
Now you get to a higher sort of prior
probability with, antibodies
or so-called biologics,
other classes of drugs
that are intrinsically more likely to work
than small molecules.
But still, in every case, you're dealing
with very low probabilities of success.
And the entire challenge
is a biotech investors.
How do you manage
those low probability events and build
portfolios that are still likely
to make money, despite the fact
that each individual project
is relatively unlikely to work?
I'd say in tech,
there's this well-described kind of power
law distribution of winners and losers,
which is to say,
a very small number of companies
make all the money and pay
for the huge number of losers in biotech.
That's still true to a degree, but
the magnitudes of the winners are lower.
And so a really good biotech investor
probably has a lower,
sorry, a higher batting average
than the typical tech investor.
But the winds are not as big.</p>

### 交易来源与“死亡之谷”

与科技领域相比，生物技术领域的交易来源（deal sourcing）相对容易。Wallach 指出，尽管存在大量优秀的科学理念，但相对于这些理念的数量，可获得的资本却显得稀缺。这些理念大多源自美国大学和研究机构。然而，将这些学术概念转化为能够盈利的实际产品，是生物技术行业面临的核心挑战，即所谓的“死亡之谷”（valley of death）。只有极少数的大学研究项目能够成功跨越这一鸿沟。这不仅需要科学家的发明能力，还需要具备将早期科学转化为成熟产品的专业知识和人才，而这正是大型制药公司和合同研究组织（CROs - Contract Research Organizations）所擅长的领域。

<p class="english-text">So one thing I'm really curious about
is how you source potential investments
and how you find, you know,
you use the analogy of the record
producer,
how you find talent in the space
or how the talent kind of finds you
and whether or not it's different
from, again, the sort of soft where
or tech space that we usually talk about
when it comes to venture capital.
You know, when I started doing venture
investing, there was,
like I said, 12, 13 years ago,
it was obviously a well-established part
of the capital markets.
But, you know, I cold emailed
Brian Armstrong from Coinbase
and was meeting with them two days later.
And it's hard to overstate
how much money has rushed in
over the past decade.
So what went from being an established
but still kind of marginal part
of the capital markets
is now all anyone thinks or talks about.
Yeah.
And so in biotech,
what I found getting into this area
was that it was more like that
venture market I had encountered.
There was a scarcity of capital
relative to the capital,
the caliber of ideas that were out there.
And so I'd say deal sourcing
is much easier in a sense,
because there's less money chasing.
Yeah, huge number of good ideas.
And those ideas, by and large,
do come out of our university
and research infrastructure
here in America.
The same is also true
in other parts of the world,
in Europe, China, India and so forth.
But it's really the translation
of those academic concepts into products
that could make money.
That is the challenge.
That's the so-called valley of death
that people
sometimes talk about in our industry.
Yeah, there are just an immense number
of cool ideas
if you go into any university
in our country,
but such a small number of them
is ever going to cross that chasm.
And part of that is that the expertise
and the personnel required to do that
translational work
is not the same expertise
that is required to do
the inventing in the first place.
And so that is really what
the large pharmaceutical companies
have a specialized expertise,
and they train people
in this translational work.
How do you go from early science
to real products?
Right.</p>

### “科技生物”运动与人工智能的崛起

近年来，一种被称为“科技生物”（Tech Bio）的趋势兴起，吸引了许多硅谷的科技投资者进入生物技术领域。他们认为，生物技术行业即将迎来变革，并可能像科技行业一样，由年轻、聪明的创业者（例如来自斯坦福大学的 21 岁学生）引领。这种观点认为，人工智能（AI）的进步将极大地简化药物研发过程。然而，Wallach 对这种“恐龙偏见”（dinosaur bias）——即认为老牌行业由不懂技术的老古董主导的假设——持谨慎态度。他承认 AI 在生命科学领域取得了突破性进展，例如 DeepMind 的 AlphaFold（一种利用机器学习预测蛋白质三维结构的 AI 模型），这对药物研发至关重要。但他同时指出，许多关于 AI 的投资和创业热潮中充斥着夸大的宣传。他提到，自己现在更倾向于使用 Gemini 而非 ChatGPT，并认为 AI 的真正价值在于解决实际问题，而非仅仅制造“噱头”。

<p class="english-text">When I go to like a typical venture
capitalist website
or I see their Twitter bio or something
like that, it'll say like,
we met great founders and I'm like,
thanks, that's very helpful because
that distinguishes you from the venture
capitalists who backed crappy founders.
So I'm glad I'm going to invest
with you instead.
What's the biotech equivalent?
What's the cliche in your industry
that every VC says that ostensibly
distinguishes them from all the others?
Well, I'm not sure what the VCs say.
I mean, they are kind of commoditized
in the sense that most of the firms
look pretty similar.
They employ 30 PhDs and physicians,
and the value of those people
is that they can make sense
of the information that you have
to process
to invest intelligently in this space.
In terms of what distinguishes
the founders that they like to look at,
I'd say again, it's kind of the inverse
of what you find in tech.
There's a real premium on, quote,
gray hair in the biotech industry,
because the only way to learn this stuff
is to do it over and over again.
And they have had a lot of failures.
And if you think about a software company,
the tropes you are familiar with,
are you know, fail fast, pivot.
Right.
You know, like you launch
something that doesn't work.
You tweak the product design,
you go into a different market,
you can adapt very readily to the market.
In biotech, if you choose to embark upon
a clinical program,
you're in for 30 or 40 million bucks.
That's not an easy door
to walk back out of.
Yeah.
And so there's a real premium on people
with experience who have done it
multiple times.
That is a little bit
at odds in recent years with a movement
that people have, I think, awkwardly
dubbed tech bio instead of biotech.
And really,
these are Silicon Valley tech investors,
not totally unlike myself,
who have gotten into biotech.
And they think that what's about to change
is it's going to go
the way of the tech industry,
and the next big companies
are going to be started by really clever
21 year olds coming out of Stanford.
And that hypothesis people
have been testing now for a few years.
I'd say it's a little too early to,
issue a verdict is that that's
never really been our theory.
Is that hypothesis just predicated on AI
coming in and making,
you know, drug development easier?
Is that all it is?
There's a lot of that.
I'd say there are two parts of it.
One of it is
maybe more substantive than that.
This is a little nuanced.
I know of lots of people like nuance.
We love it.
One of the big transformations that
really gave rise to the biotech industry.
And when I use that term biotech,
I'm distinguishing it from big pharma.
So biotech really just means
small drug companies.
Many of them are public.
What really gave rise to
that industry was the big
pharma is at the behest of Wall Street
Deprioritized early stage research,
because Wall Street
said you're wasting a lot of money on this
really risky early stage discovery work.
What we would rather you did
was just let all these crazy guys
like de finance startups,
and once they work, just by then,
you know
you're going to pay a higher price,
but you won't be burning all this money
on early stuff.
What that led to was an exodus
of very specialized technical experts
from the pharma companies,
and it created the so-called CRO, or
contract research organization ecosystem.
So you now, as a consequence of that,
for the past
20 years have had a very proficient,
environment, full of,
contract organizations
that you can hire as a little company
to outsource a lot of work
that you couldn't in the past.
So the best analogy to tat to tech
would be sort of like virtual servers
or cloud infrastructure, like,
you know, to have a startup,
you used to have
all these servers in your office
and then at some point
you didn't need that.
So the cost of new company
formation went way down.
So part of the argument for younger,
more agile founders has been, look,
we got this whole new kind
of infrastructure
through which they can build companies
in a really agile way.
The other argument, you know, exactly to
your question is around AI.
And that theory is basically, look,
these old people don't understand AI.
Let's get some young Silicon Valley
computer science types to do this.
And they're going to show them
how it's done.
I feel like that's probably.
A phenomenon that goes beyond biotech,
where there's
this fantasy
and maybe in some cases it's even correct.
But there is this fantasy
that every industry out there
must be dominated by old dinosaurs
who don't know how to use tech,
and who have been doing something
the same way forever.
And so steer 2025.
It must be out of date by now,
and they haven't figured this out.
And if we could just cough,
cough journalism.
Yeah, right.
If we could just hire whiz kids,
then we could reinvent the industry
from first principles and just do a much
better job than the legacy things.
And I think whether it's health care
or whether it's industrial stuff
that we see Silicon Valley getting excited
about right now, it just feels like
the default assumption
must be that the veterans are doing
something wrong, and with pure brainpower,
we can figure out what that thing is.
I think that
is a reasonable characterization
of what people say.
Yeah, in a lot of different places.
And I don't think it's true in my sector.
But as with every conversation about AI,
the challenge is balancing
two ideas that can be true
at the same time, but seem contradictory.
And one is that this stuff is amazing.
And it is, particularly in life sciences,
responsible for some true breakthroughs
like the breakthrough
that won Demis Hassabis at DeepMind,
the Nobel Prize last year with,
AlphaFold, which was this amazing
discovery they made that use in machine
learning models.
You could solve a problem
that had gone unsolved for decades,
which was can you predict
from the sequence of a proteins
amino acids what three dimensional shape
a protein is going to take
in a physical environment
and I just threw around
a bunch of terms of art.
But this is fundamental
to drug development and drug discovery.
So it's like on the one hand,
you can't deny these breakthroughs
that we're experiencing.
You can't deny that
when you talk to Gemini, it's staggering
what this thing can do.
I mean, I'm sitting there all day
having it teach me about asset
pricing models
or whatever else I'm interested in.
But at the same time,
the religious movement
that is powering all of the investment
and a lot of the entrepreneurship here
across industries is full of hot air
and is making claims
that are preposterous.
Unless you are a zealot.
Just real quickly.
If we'd been having this conversation
in a month ago,
would you have said Gemini?
Or would you have said ChatGPT?
Because I switched from Chegg,
we did a Gemini in the last month,
and I'm just curious whether you're
what you would have said a month ago.
A month ago, I was using all of them.
Now I'm only using Gemini.
It's interesting.
All right, good data point.</p>

### 药物研发的瓶颈与监管考量

药物从概念到上市的过程，可以被视为一个漏斗。最初涌入的是数百万个想法，随着流程的深入，需要投入越来越多的资金来证明两点：一是药物的安全性（不会对人体造成伤害或死亡），二是药物的有效性（能实际改善所治疗的疾病）。然而，目前验证这些安全性和有效性的唯一方法是在活生生的人体上进行临床试验（clinical trials），这是一个极其耗时且成本高昂的过程。尽管 AI 技术可以帮助产生更多好的想法，但它并不能解决药物研发的核心瓶颈——即临床试验的漫长周期和高昂费用。

关于监管，Wallach 提到，虽然有人认为美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）的审批流程过于缓慢，但也有观点认为，如果完全取消 FDA，允许任何药物直接上市，可能会导致更多人因无效或有害的药物而死亡，这类似于当前的补充剂行业。他引用了米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）的观点，即 FDA 应仅评估药物的安全性，而市场应根据用户体验来决定其有效性和价值。Wallach 个人更倾向于一个有严格安全性和有效性标准的体系。他指出，中国在监管环境方面正快速变化，旨在提高审批效率和数量，并在效率与高标准之间寻求平衡。

<p class="english-text">talk to us about the choke points
when it comes to new drug development,
because I imagine, okay, maybe
AI machine learning can speed up
some of the research or discovery process,
but even after that, you have to go
through these really long clinical trials
that in some cases take decades.
What what are the major,
I guess, like stumbling blocks
to getting something to the market?
Your question held the answer.
So the the process of taking a drug
from idea to the market,
you can think of as a funnel
to just use a visual analogy
and into the top of the funnel go all the
millions of ideas that people have.
And then as you go down the funnel,
you are spending progressively
more and more and more money
to prove two things.
The first is that the drug is safe
and won't harm
or kill people,
and the second is that the drug works
and it actually modifies
the disease that you're trying to treat.
And the tragedy of our moment
is that the only way to figure out
if drugs are safe and effective
is to try them in human beings,
living, breathing human beings.
And that is extraordinarily time consuming
and incredibly expensive financially.
So I wish for the day
when AI is able to fully simulate
an accurate human in the computer,
and we don't need to do clinical trials
on real people.
But until that moment, the vast
majority of the cost and expense and time
that is involved in drug discovery
remains with us.
So most of the AI technologies
that people are excited about really
would have the effect of putting more
good ideas into the top of the funnel.
But unfortunately,
that doesn't solve a problem that we have.
We already are drowning in good ideas,
and the issue is exactly the choke point
or bottleneck that you're referring to.
This is really I
there's actually two questions.
First of all, is there low hanging fruit
from a regulatory side
to accelerate that process?
People like to fathom, oh,
the FDA must be super.
There's another area
people will say, well,
the FDA must be super slow and do things
one way we could speed this up.
I don't know, is there somewhere
along the process where like
from a regulatory standpoint
or some other thing that the either
the cost of the timelines could shrink
or is it mostly still just the reality of
we have to test these things on humans,
and that's costly and it takes time.
Well, we don't need to do anything.
We could have no FDA. Sure.
And anyone who has a good drug idea
just launches it commercially.
And if some people die from that
and it doesn't do anything, that's fine.
By the way, that's
kind of like the supplement industry.
Yeah. Peptide. Deal with it.
Milton Friedman
famously thought that the FDA
should only assess the safety of drugs.
Yeah, and if a drug was proven safe,
put it on the market
and let the market dictate
whether people determine
they should pay for it
based on their lived experience
with whether it works or not.
Now, I just personally prefer
to live in a world
where
if I've got something that's going wrong,
I can more or less trust that the product
my doctor gives me
has been proven safe and effective,
and that reflects that.
We have today a pretty high bar
for approving drugs,
but we could certainly lower that bar.
We could change the type of data
that the FDA requires.
And that's what's happening in China.
By the way, I know you mentioned this
other episode you did with my friend Tim.
In China, the regulatory environment
has been moving pretty rapidly,
and they've done that deliberately
because they want to be more productive,
they want to approve more drugs,
and they're trying to strike that balance
between being prolific and, holding things
to a high standard at the same time.
So, you know, we'll see.
And I just want to
follow up on one other thing you said,
because I think it seems important,
someone like Sam Altman,
when he talks about the promise of AI
a lot of it is like, oh, we could find
the next drug that cures cancer.
In the meantime,
we're going to make the sort of slot
machine that makes weird videos, etc.
but really, we're trying to find
these wonder drugs in the long term.
But for what?
It sounds like you said, candidates
are not where the shortage is like.
The issue is not that we lack
a sufficiently
a number of sufficiently promising
molecule combinations.
The scarcity is not on that at that point.
That's my view.
I mean, I'll steal, man.
The other argument, the other thing,
it would be, well, look, DEA,
you said ten minutes ago that these drugs
have a 5% probability
of working from the outset.
You know, if we had better
predictive models that told us certain
candidates were much more likely to work
than others, wouldn't that be great?
And my rejoinder to that is, yes, but
how would we know that we've done that?
Meaning, if the three of us tomorrow
invented a black box
that produce drug candidate concepts,
and we were certain
that our model doubled the prior
probability from 5% to 10%,
that would be a truly revolutionary
innovation on our part.
But how many candidates from that model
would we need to take
all the way to an approval?
Before we had statistically demonstrated
that we,
in fact increased the rate of of success?
Yeah.
So people may have already cracked
that code.
You know,
Google may have already cracked the code.
Sam Altman may have cracked that code,
but someone's going to need to spend $30
billion developing the drug ideas he has
before we know whether he's done that.
And until that money is spent,
it's pure conjecture and salesmanship.</p>

### 中美生物技术竞争与临床试验的可信度

Wallach 认为，未来十年，中国在全球生物技术市场将扮演重要角色，并可能成为“大故事”。中国在监管、人才吸引（许多在美国接受教育的顶尖人才已回归中国）以及临床试验的执行速度和规模方面都拥有显著优势。美国虽然在生物技术领域仍是领导者，但其基础设施处理临床试验的能力已显不足。尽管如此，Wallach 表示自己因语言障碍（不懂中文）而难以直接投资中国市场，但他注意到美国公司正日益将部分研发和临床试验外包给中国。

关于中国临床试验数据的可信度，Wallach 指出，过去几年，美国投资者和监管机构曾对中国数据的真实性表示怀疑，甚至带有种族偏见。然而，随着一些重要的中国临床试验在欧洲和美国得到成功复制，人们的看法正在转变，对中国数据的信任度逐渐提高。他强调，中国需要持续提升其工作和数据的质量，以增强全球信任。

<p class="english-text">How are you actually evaluating
opportunities in the US against China
competition?
Because, you know, if clinical trials
are the major choke point
and if China seems to be trying
to make that process
as efficient as possible, it seems like
maybe they have an advantage.
I mean, they definitely have an advantage.
And if I had to make a bet today
on our sector, it would be that
China is going to be the big story
over the next decade or two.
I think it's a fundamental structural
shift in the global biotechnology market.
And there are advantages are multiple.
I mean, their advantages are regulatory.
They relate to the personnel.
We have lost an amazing amount of talent
who was educated here
in our graduate schools
and now has gone back to China.
And furthermore, they are,
able to develop things in the clinic
which is to say, do clinical trials
a lot faster and at a much higher volume
than our infrastructure can handle.
So they've got big advantages.
Now, how do I think about investing
in the US versus China?
I don't that much
because I don't speak Mandarin.
And I think it would be really difficult
for me to invest in China today.
But increasingly, companies in the U.S.
are starting to outsource
certain parts of the research process
to Chinese companies.
And increasingly,
they're going to outsource parts
of the clinical development process,
the clinical trials to China,
that's going to make a huge impact
on the industry.
Yeah. This was actually my next question.
I guess how translatable is a successful
clinical trial
in China to a market like the US?
3 or 4 years ago, what
both investors and regulators in
the US would have told you
was that it's not that translatable
because they're liars
and they make up all the data
and it's rampant with fraud.
And there may have been
some truth to that,
but I think there was also
a good amount of racism.
And what sort of woke
everyone up in the past couple of years
was that some very significant
clinical trials were done in China.
People were suspicious of the data.
Then they replicated those trials
in Europe or the United States
and got very similar data.
And folks thought, whoa,
maybe they're not so bad at this.
So I think decreasingly people
are skeptical.
And which said, less awkwardly,
people are trusting more and more
what's coming out of China.
And it's incumbent upon the Chinese,
to the extent that they want
this to be a major strategy to continue,
enhancing people's trust in the quality
of their work in their data.
If they can do that,
I think it's a global industry.
A lot of the companies are multinationals.
They don't care if the drug comes
out of the U.S. or comes out of China.
This isn't really
a question about private or VC stage
investing per se,
but about biotech more broadly.
You know, there is some sickos out there
on the internet who like trade by trade,
retail traders
who trade up biotech stocks.
And again, this is I've never I've talked
you know, I've covered the stock market
for a long time in various ways.
I've never spent any time really getting
to know a publicly traded biotech stock.
Is are you insane
to try to invest in biotech?
If you don't have a PhD level
understanding of biology, like,
can anyone have alpha in this industry
if they don't actually know
science?
I think it's tough.
Yeah, it seems very tough to me.
Yeah. I mean, here's the thing.
What's really interesting about biotech
in the public markets is it's
abundantly clear that active investors
can have alpha in biotech.
Whereas as you guys know
that is not clear.
Right.
And the rest of the public
equity landscape.
And so whereas there is very little
if not negative persistence of performance
among active equity managers
broadly in biotech,
you have a small number of firms that have
been doing great for sometimes decades.
And they all have real
science expertise on staff.
They do.
And, you know, the dynamic
between them and the generalists,
so to speak,
is that they do a lot of very detailed
work to make sense of the information
you need to process,
to value these companies and to assess
their probability of success.
And then the generalists often follow
those specialists into these names
and the fortunes of the industry
in these cycles,
like we're coming out of a four year
Great Depression for biotech,
I should just mention
a lot of those fortunes
ride on the sector
rotations of the generalists.
So the specialists have to stick
with biotech because that's what they do.
But whether or not companies can IPO,
whether or not companies
can fund their next clinical trial
is largely a function of
whether the generalists are in the sector
at that moment or not.
And we're just in the midst of the early
rotation of generalists back into biotech.</p>

### 生物技术投资的金融激励与定价逻辑

美国市场是全球药物开发公司最大的“奖赏池”。这是因为美国社会普遍希望优先获得最先进的药物，并且不愿剥夺患者受益的机会。然而，这种承诺的代价是美国国内的药物价格远高于其他国家。其他国家政府通过选择性地批准药物并进行价格谈判来控制成本。

Wallach 解释说，药物定价与创新激励密切相关。专利法赋予了制药公司在一定时期内的合法垄断权，这决定了它们能从新药中获利多少。如果缩短专利期，利润池会缩小，从而减少药物研发；反之，如果延长专利期，研发投入会大幅增加。他认为，我们选择允许多少创新发生，是通过决定这个“奖赏池”的大小来体现的。对于像伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）等批评者提出的高利润问题，Wallach 回应说，减少利润可能会导致更少的药物研发投入。

<p class="english-text">With the biotech investing downturn,
was that just a function
of higher interest rates,
or was something else going on?
It was a confluence of everything
that could go wrong.
At the same time,
it was higher interest rates,
which really punished these biotech stocks
relative to other companies because,
you know, no cash flows for ten years
and then a big bowl of some money.
So these companies are very sensitive
to discount rates.
Yeah.
Add to that
this dynamic where the generalists
had gotten out of the sector
that ultimately is fatal.
And then, consider the fact
that we had such a comedown
after the sugar high of Covid.
So obviously, during Covid,
there was this moment of clarity
where everyone for a second recognized
that this sector is for each of us
at some point in our lives,
the most important thing
that happens in the global economy,
like without the biotech industry,
you know, we're all in trouble.
And we kind of
go through life pretending like we're
never going to need this industry.
And then you get cancer
or your dad gets cancer.
Yeah, your kid gets some rare disease,
and you go,
Holy cow,
I wish I'd thought about this before.
Maybe all these people who are doing this
with their lives are not evil
bloodsuckers
who Bernie Sanders needs to take down.
And, you know, that is,
I think part of what dawned on people
during Covid
when we all were vulnerable
and we all were yearning for a solution.
Talk a little bit more about, I guess, the
the financial incentives
about actually developing new drugs.
So we we all know the story of
if you're based in the US,
you can go to Mexico or wherever else
and buy the same medicine
for like five bucks as opposed to $500
or perhaps even more in the US.
And the argument for
that seems to be that, well,
you know, the big pharma companies
need to be rewarded
for all the research and the effort
and the risk that they actually take on.
And for some reason, the US seems to be
the designated place to do that.
But like, why?
Why is my question why U.S drug pricing?
Well, the the big bounty
for a drug development
company is the United States market.
And that's partly because we as a society
have decided that we want
all the new most advanced drugs.
We want them first
and we don't want to deny them to people
who could benefit from them.
Now the price we pay for those commitments
is that our drug prices are higher
than the prices in other countries.
And the reason their prices are lower
is because their governments
choose which drugs
their people will have access to,
and they make those choices and then
negotiate the prices with the companies.
And they basically will say to Pfizer
or AstraZeneca,
look,
if you want your drug sold here in Japan,
you're going to take the price
that we give you.
And then the pharma company decides
whether they want to accept that deal
or not.
Now, the United States absolutely could
choose as a civilization to negotiate.
In that same manner, our government
could make the choice for us as to exactly
what we're willing to pay for every drug
there would be two consequences to that.
One is that we would
go without certain drugs.
The second
is that a lot of drugs would not even
be developed in the first place,
because the total pool of profits
available to drug companies
would be much smaller.
And so I don't know that
there's any perfect answer
to how much pharmaceutical innovation
we should have in the world.
We get to choose how much innovation
we want to occur and the way we choose.
That is by determining
the size of that bounty that exists.
How big is the profit pool?
We want to allow for innovative drug
development, and a lot of that is driven
by our patent law.
Remember, a patent in
this industry is a legalized monopoly.
So we give drug companies a legal monopoly
for a limited period of time.
And that dictates how much money
they're able to make off of a new drug.
We could shorten the patent life
and that would reduce the profit pool,
and you'd have less drug development.
We could remove the patent life.
You could have a permanent monopoly.
And believe me, the industry would
double or triple overnight.
So it's a choice we have to make
and it's a civic choice.
You mentioned the Bernie Sanders
of the world who, they look at the profits
of drug companies,
they look at the prices of drugs. And,
you know, perhaps if they got their way,
there would be less investment
in drug discovery instead of drug at all,
maybe less profit going back to Covid.
However, there was also the backlash
on the other side,
essentially
just this deep skepticism towards
the premise of pharma and that
what are these scientists doing?
And why don't they tell you
about this route
that people have used for thousands
of years that cured these diseases
that they don't want you to know about,
so that they can sell your stuff?
Talk to us about like,
just the sort of political environment
investing in biotech
in a political environment
or a growing number of people, frankly,
seem to distrust
the promise of scientific expertise.</p>

### 对科学专业知识的信任与医疗决策自主权

公众对科学专业知识的信任度下降是一个复杂的问题。Wallach 认为，科学界自身也应承担部分责任，尤其是在早期 COVID-19 疫情期间，关于口罩的价值以及疫苗有效性的沟通不够清晰，甚至存在误导，这侵蚀了公众的信任。他强调，医学正经历一个从“巫术和魔法”向真正科学的漫长演变过程，其中仍存在许多未经严格证据支持的常见做法。因此，他倡导医学界应更加透明地沟通，以重建信任。

在医疗决策自主权方面，Wallach 认为个人最终应拥有对自己身体的决定权，并将医生视为提供建议的顾问。然而，他也指出，由于医疗成本的社会化（即由集体承担），在一定程度上需要设定标准来决定哪些治疗是“适宜支付”的。他认为，私人保险行业在美国医疗体系中几乎没有增值作用，并且不应由保险公司来决定何种医疗是恰当的。

<p class="english-text">Look, it's tough, and
some of the blame certainly belongs
with the scientific community,
because, you know,
to the extent that, say, in the early days
of Covid, communication
with the public about, say,
the value of masks was not clear
and it was maybe even misleading.
Yeah, some of the presentation of data
regarding the efficacy of the vaccines
was not transparent.
And that eroded the public's
trust in a very understandable way.
Now, I'm
no apologist for medicine or science
because I don't think these are privileged
priesthoods.
I think every person should be able
to be engaged
in and understand science and medicine.
And unfortunately,
the entire history of medicine
began with medical science
as total witchcraft and sorcery.
So if you go back to antiquity,
the first people
calling themselves
doctors objectively understood nothing.
Yeah.
So this was pure sophistry
from the beginning.
And we are on this long journey
through
which medicine is going from total B.S.
and witchcraft
to slowly turning into a real science,
something that deserves to be called
science.
Medicine is filled with common practices
that are not rigorously based on evidence,
and that is symptomatic of where we are
in that journey that I'm describing.
So I'm an advocate for medicine
becoming always more and more scientific.
I believe that scientific policymakers,
scientists and academia
need to do a much better job
communicating transparently,
and that's the only way to engender
that kind of trust.
You're talking about show,
and the trust is critical
because it is what gives permission
to this industry's existence.
We talk more about, I guess, autonomy
when it comes to medical decisions,
because this is, you know, a big culture
shock of non-Americans who come to the US
is drug adverts on TV where they,
you know, here's this great drug,
and then they read off all the risk
factors really, really quickly.
And one of the risks is always death
or severe brain damage or something.
Suicidal tendencies.
Yeah.
And I'm always like, again,
I've never asked
for a drug that I've seen on TV.
I do remember when I,
when I first came to the US as an adult,
I went to get a prescription.
I found a new doctor to do that.
And I said I needed this thing.
And the doctor was like, oh, well,
we have to run all these medical tests
before we can give you that.
And it ended up in a big argument
with my insurance provider.
And I remember
talking to people about that,
and they were like, well,
you should have pushed back
against the doctor about the testing.
And I was like, what do I know?
I just do what the doctor tells me, right?
How much, say, should people?
Actually, it sounds weird,
but you know, given the lack of experience
and given the way other systems
work, around the world,
how much safe should people
have in their own medical treatment?
I think
ultimately they should have almost
all of the say it's your body.
Ultimately,
you have to make the best decision
you can make, and you should regard
physicians, nurses, others in the system
as consultants
who support you in making wise decisions.
The one caveat there, however,
is that we do socialize
a lot of our medical costs.
And in many other countries,
they completely socialized medical costs.
And to the extent that you want
the rest of us to pay
for your medical care, I do believe
we need to have some standards around
what it's appropriate to pay for.
Yeah.
I mean, at the moment
it seems like most of those decisions
are left up to the insurers,
which again, in other places in the world,
it would be left up to, to the governments
to make those decisions.
Are insurers
the sort of another limiting factor here?
I believe they are.
I believe the private insurance industry
adds zero value to the United States
health care system, almost,
that it may slightly overstate it,
but it's close to zero in my book.
And I really don't believe
insurance companies ought to be the ones
making decisions
about what medical care is appropriate.</p>

### AI 与音乐创作的未来

在节目接近尾声时，Wallach 谈到了 AI 对音乐产业的影响。他承认许多音乐人对 AI 生成音乐感到焦虑，因为这可能改变他们的收入模式。他以自己经历 Spotify 带来的变革为例，指出技术进步最初可能引发恐惧，但最终往往能增加整个行业的总收入。Wallach 相信，艺术家（包括音乐家、记者和投资者）将学会利用 AI 工具来提高效率、增强创作能力，并产生更酷的作品。他认为，音乐本质上是沟通，AI 不会取代艺术家，反而可能激发新的、原创的艺术形式。

关于学习音乐技艺的必要性，Wallach 认为，对乐器（如钢琴）的深入理解能带来更丰富的创作选择。如果创作过程仅限于通过自然语言提示来生成音乐，可能会削弱表达的精细度和广度。他认为，伟大的艺术创作往往源于对技艺的深刻掌握，而不仅仅是语言描述。

<p class="english-text">I noticed there in the video
you have a really nice looking microphone.
Is that like a is that a,
is that a musical?
Is that a microphone for recording music?
Yeah, this is
this is the one I, this is one I sing on.
It's first of all, you sound good,
but it also looks a lot cooler
than the typical microphone
that are, that are guests.
Do you, do you are you still
are you still playing much music?
I do, but but thankfully, now it's
just for fun, not for money,
which is a much more comfortable place
for it to live in my life.
Are you, do you think at all about,
AI generated music
and, the effect that that's going to have
on musicians this month?
I feel like a lot of musicians, like
the ones that I follow on Instagram.
I would say there's
a lot of anxiety about this.
There is anxiety.
And look, I mean, it's really hard
to make a living as a musician.
Yeah.
Now it's always been really hard and,
you know, I can't imagine what the
lifestyle was of a lute player and George
the second Royal Court or something.
But, you know, it's a tough business
and it is scary
when new technology comes on the scene.
That might change the way
you make money as an artist.
I lived through that with Spotify.
People were terrified of it and, you know,
fortunately, what it did over time.
They should have all done
what you did, would get long Spotify
and then hedge their own risk to it,
but keep going on the.
Spot.
Spotify by multiples
increased the total revenue
of the recorded music business,
which was the goal.
So mission accomplished. Now
look, I is going to make music.
And I think like all creative people,
like journalists, like investors,
everyone is going to think about
how they can use it to be more effective,
have more leverage, have a cooler output.
I mean, I have very little doubt
that artists are going to do
unbelieve cool and original stuff
with AI tools, and it's already happening.
And for whatever reason,
I have very little trepidation
that they're going
to be put out of business,
because I think ultimately music
is communication.
Real quickly on that.
When you talk about like doing
unbelievably cool things with music.
So I see in the background
you have a piano for example.
And one of the things
when I think about AI music is
and actually I think like, for example,
the founder of sumo
and some of these other AI,
music companies I've talked about,
this is like,
well, music, learning to play instruments
is really hard.
And therefore can we separate in some way
the craft of music,
the hours that someone has to spend
just doing scales on the piano
before they can compose something?
Maybe you could. What?
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could just have amazing, beautiful
piano sonatas without ever having had
put in those thousands of hours?
You know, Mary had a little lamb
and then so forth.
But it does raise the question to my mind
of whether one can create
great art
if they never had to learn the craft.
I think
the nuance with which one can
communicate through music
is a function
of how many options you perceive.
Okay?
In other words,
if you know the piano inside out,
you're aware of so many creative
choices at your disposal at any moment.
And if your ability to express yourself
is squeezed
down to what you can put
into a natural language prompt.
Yes. Now those musical ideas are having
to pass through the medium of language
right to be realized,
and that inherently erodes
the resolution and the expansiveness
with which you can express yourself.
Yeah, I feel like there's a danger here
that you go off on a big orality tangent
and whether ideas can exist without words
and things like that.
No, but I do think this is this,
that answer very insightful.
Like,
can you actually create great piano music
if you don't know the limits
of what the piano can do?
And if you're only trying to describe
in language, make this beautiful sonata.
I think that's very tough.
And I thought that answer made a lesson.</p>

<p class="english-text">Da. We're going to have to wrap it up
soon.
I have one last question,
and I'm going to kind of I'm
going to put you on the spot.
Can you can you sing a little Odd Lots song
for us? like three bars of an Odd Lots Song?
I don't care if you generate it
with, you know, I guess Gemini now,
but if you think you could.
Let's see. I mean.
Oh, wow.
I'm going to turn this on.
Let's see. Here.
Oh, this is really cool. Yeah.
If you aren't watching the video.
So he's moving his microphone.
He's moving his microphone to his keyboard
okay.
Can you see me. Yeah. Yeah.
All right. Yeah.
Go for it. I'm in through here.
Okay.
We're going to try.
And it's all about.
It's all about.
It's all about Tracy.
It's all about.
It's all about.
It's all about Joe.
How's that.
Feel? Pretty good. You have.
You have a great voice. Yeah. It is.
If you ever want to compose
an outro song for us.
Yeah, something like that.
I would love to. I'm.
I am the composer of 2 or 3 podcasts.
Theme song.
Oh, and, I have to say, I love your guys.
Thank you.
It gets
me excited
that I got to end on this for you guys.
You know, in high school,
the reason I got into
investing in high school,
I was an economics nerd.
Oh, yeah, I. Heard.
I heard that you actually wrote, like,
some,
a paper that won, like, a prize
from the fed or something like that.
The Federal Reserve
had this nerd competition,
and they sponsored called Fed Challenge
and captain
of my high school team one year,
and we got to DC and we we saw
Greenspan walk out with his wise
and face and hands and anyways,
if I had had odd lots to listen to in high
school, man, I would have been in heaven
because you guys touched on
so much interesting stuff.
And this just has to be
the most exciting thing for young people
to, experience in order to get turned on
to business and economics and finance
and recognize these aren't just boring,
that's, you know, staid topics.
They're fascinating.
Now, thank you for saying that.
I really appreciate it. And also,
thank you for singing for us.
I think that was an Odd Lots first
  that was a first. Yeah.
So you're well on the spot.
I know we've had, moral hazard. Yeah.
Country singing economist on before
but that was fantastic.
D.A. Wallach,
thank you so much for coming on the show.
Really appreciate you guys.
Thanks for having me.
That was really interesting, Jeff.
That was super fun. He was great.
He's also pretty good at, you know,
I know again, he said it was tenuous,
but the through line from music to biotech
kind of makes sense.
I think it makes a lot of sense in the
especially the fact that,
you know, these are these are all startup
investing, as we know.
You know, there's there's this power
law phenomenon where one of your 20
portfolio companies
is going to make all the money.
Yeah, the lottery ticket.
But, you know, like biotech is like
lottery ticket to lottery tickets.
There's so much success, uncertainty.
Lottery with lower payouts.
There's lower payouts. There's
so much success, uncertainty.
There's so much time that elapses between
the initial work and where you have
see if there's any signals of traction.
It does feel a lot like the uncertainty
that exists in the music industry
and selecting like,
which of these 100 bands
that all sound great
and they're all really talented, actually
has what it takes to be a commercial hit.
A lot of parallels. Yeah.
I thought the the dinosaur bias point
was an interesting one as well
because you can imagine, like again,
to the timeline point,
you kind of have to be old to have
any success in the industry historically,
just because it can take, you know, a
decade to get a particular drug to market.
So you don't have that much opportunity
to have, you know, those wins
unless you get old.
And there's no shortage.
There's no, you know, there may be
regulatory things that can be done.
But fundamentally, if you want to know
whether something works
and if you want to know whether this drug
is going to kill people who take it or not
and whether it's safe or not,
there is no substitute for doing a test
and seeing what, what happens.
And to to your point
or to your observation
about the dinosaurs, like,
I do think that lots of people
have this fantasy that anytime
there's a legacy industry of any sort,
that if you just got 21 year olds
from Stanford in the same room, you gave.
Them a garage and workout.
Garage, that they would do it a lot
better than the veterans.
That was the DOGE premise.
And, DOGE doesn't exist anymore. So. Yeah.
All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
