### 新闻播报

**Tracy Mumpford**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumpford。今天是2月12日，星期四。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumpford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumpford. Today's Thursday, February 12th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

### 埃尔帕索机场混乱

**Reporter**: 我想非常非常清楚地说明，这件事本不应该发生。在没有与城市协调的情况下，你不能限制一个主要城市的领空。在德克萨斯州埃尔帕索，当地领导人严厉批评了昨天该市上空领空突然而神秘的关闭事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: I want to be very, very clear that this should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city. In El Paso, Texas, local leaders sharply criticized the abrupt and mysterious closure of the airspace over the city yesterday.

</details>

**Reporter**: >> 所有航空运营都被停飞，包括紧急航班。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> All aviation operations were grounded, including emergency flights.

</details>

**Reporter**: 这是自9/11以来未曾发生过的重大且不必要的干扰。混乱始于周二深夜，当时**联邦航空管理局 (FAA)** 宣布关闭埃尔帕索领空10天，毫无预警。几小时后该命令被撤销，但相互矛盾的解释加剧了混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11. The chaos began late Tuesday night when the Federal Aviation Administration announced a 10-day closure of El Paso's airspace with no warning. It was rescinded just hours later, but competing explanations for what happened have caused even more confusion.

</details>

**Reporter**: **特朗普政府**的高级官员表示，关闭发生于**墨西哥贩毒集团**的无人机突然越过美国边境之后。交通部长在社交媒体上声称，“威胁已被解除。”但《纽约时报》采访的多位知情人士的说法削弱了这一解释。他们表示，**FAA**发布关闭令是因为**边境巡逻队**使用了**五角大楼**借调的激光反无人机设备，而航空官员认为他们没有足够的时间或信息来确保商业航班不受影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Top Trump administration officials said the shutdown happened after Mexican cartel drones suddenly crossed the US border. The Secretary of Transportation claimed on social media that quote, "The threat has been neutralized." But that explanation was undercut by multiple people the Times talked to who'd been briefed on the situation. They said the FAA issued the shutdown order after Border Patrol used an anti- drone laser on loan from the Pentagon, and aviation officials felt they didn't have enough time or information to make sure commercial flights wouldn't be affected.

</details>

**Reporter**: 使用激光的边境巡逻队特工以为他们瞄准的是贩毒集团的无人机。结果却是一个派对气球。即使在这起事件之前，像五角大楼的激光这类反无人机技术的滥用也已引起安全担忧。近年来，军方开发了一系列防御系统，包括微波干扰器和火箭发射的反无人机，但其中大部分是为战区设计的。一位无人机专家告诉《纽约时报》，在国内使用这些威慑手段，那里有数千架客机飞行，会增加附带损害的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Border Patrol agents who used the laser thought they were targeting a cartel drone. It turned out to be a party balloon. Even before this incident, the ramped up use of anti- drone technology like the Pentagon's laser has raised safety concerns. In recent years, the military has developed a range of defensive systems, including microwave zappers and rocket launched counter drones, but most of those are intended for war zones. One drone expert told the Times that using those kinds of deterrents domestically where there are thousands of passenger planes flying around raises the risk of collateral damage.

### 邦迪听证会

**Reporter**: 现在，来自华盛顿的三条简讯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Now, three quick updates from Washington.

</details>

**Reporter**: >> 您宣誓或确认，您即将提供的证词是真实且正确的吗？昨天在国会山上，司法部长**Pam Bondi**与议员们进行了激烈的辩论，他们就**司法部**对**埃普斯坦调查**的处理方式质询她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct? On Capitol Hill yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi faced off with lawmakers in a bitter back and forth as they grilled her about the Department of Justice's handling of the Epstein investigation.

</details>

**Reporter**: >> 您有多少人…… >> 请稍等。我要回答问题。>> 我回答我的问题。>> 不，我要按我想回答的方式回答问题。**众议院司法委员会**的听证会迅速变得充满对抗性，因为民主党人以及至少一位共和党议员质疑该部门为何没有隐藏**埃普斯坦**受害者的一些名字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> How many have you >> Excuse me. I'm going to answer the question. >> I answer my question. >> No, I'm going to answer the question the way I want to answer the question. The hearing with the House Judiciary Committee quickly turned combative as Democrats and at least one Republican on the panel questioned why the department didn't redact the names of some of Epstein's victims from the files it released.

</details>

**Reporter**: >> 这是关于你为你的**司法部**以及它对站在你身后的幸存者造成的伤害承担责任。在一场特别紧张的交流中，华盛顿州众议员**Primila Gyipol**试图让**邦迪**向在听证室里的一群受害者道歉。我不会为了她的表演而自降身份。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> It is about you taking responsibility for your Department of Justice and the harm that it has done to the survivors who are standing right behind you. In one particularly tense exchange, Representative Primila Gyipol of Washington tried to get Bondi to apologize to a group of victims who were in the hearing room. I'm not going to get in the gutter for her theatrics.

</details>

**Reporter**: >> **邦迪**拒绝道歉，并为自己的记录辩护，称她作为一名检察官，花费了“整个职业生涯”为受害者而战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Bondi refused to apologize and defended her record, saying that as a prosecutor, she spent her quote entire career fighting for victims.

</details>

### 关税与国会

**Reporter**: 昨天在众议院，议员们还投票撤销了**特朗普总统**去年对**加拿大**征收的关税。这是一个很大程度上象征性的举动，因为特朗普可以轻易否决它。但值得注意的是，有六名共和党人与民主党人联手，对总统的政策提出反对。共和党领导人一直试图避免这种投票，部分原因是不想让共和党人在关税问题上留下支持的记录，这可能成为中期选举中的一个分裂性话题。他们甚至操纵了国会计算日期的方式，以拖延关于此事的最后期限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Also in the House yesterday, lawmakers voted to rescind the tariffs President Trump imposed on Canada last year. It's a largely symbolic move because Trump can just veto it. But it's notable that six Republicans joined with Democrats to push back on the president. GOP leaders had been trying to avoid this kind of vote in part because they didn't want Republicans to have to go on the record as supporting tariffs, which could be a divisive topic in the midterm elections. They even went as far as manipulating what counts as a day in Congress to drag out a deadline on the topic.

</details>

**Reporter**: 特朗普的广泛关税是否会维持，这个问题也在**最高法院**上演。预计法官们很快将就他最初是否有权实施这些关税做出裁决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: The question of whether Trump's sweeping tariffs will stand is also playing out in the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether he had the authority to put them in place to begin with.

</details>

### 就业市场与经济

**Reporter**: 来自**劳工部**的新数据显示，在经历了2025年动荡的一年后，今年的就业市场开局比预期强劲。1月份的就业报告显示，雇主增加了13万个工作岗位。强劲的就业数据可能表明，劳动力市场正从此前因贸易战、政府的移民镇压以及大规模解雇政府工作人员而导致的招聘缓慢时期中复苏。然而，专家警告称，经济增长并不均衡。他们称之为“**K型经济**”，就像字母K一样。基本上，高收入家庭像字母的一条分支一样不断攀升，而低收入家庭则越来越挣扎，他们的分支向下倾斜。**美国银行**的首席经济学家最近在一份报告中写道，该国已达到60年来收入不平等的高峰。一个能说明这一点的统计数据：去年，美国**1%**的家庭拥有全部净资产的13%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: And new data from the Labor Department shows that the job market is off to a stronger than expected start this year after a very bumpy 2025. The January jobs report shows employers added 130,000 jobs. The peppy results could be a sign that the labor market is emerging from a period of extremely slow hiring brought on by trade wars. the administration's immigration crackdown and its firing spree of government workers. Experts warn though that the economy is not growing evenly. They've called it a K-shaped economy as in the letter K. Basically, higher inome households keep climbing up like one branch of the letter, while lower inome households are struggling more and more, their branch angling down. The chief economist at US Bank wrote in a report recently that the country has hit a 60-year peak in income inequality. A stat to drive that home. Last year, 1th3 of Americans total net worth was held by the top 1% of households.

### 生育治疗新突破

**Reporter**: 今天上午，一群**生物技术研究人员**发表了一项新研究，该研究指向一种可能具有变革性的生育治疗方法。许多类型的治疗都涉及从女性体内取出卵子，卵子越多，获得可用于怀孕的胚胎（可能导致生育）的机会就越大。研究人员发现，传统的取卵方法常常会遗漏一些卵子，他们开发了一种设备来收集更多卵子。生育诊所传统上使用高倍显微镜在所谓的卵泡液中寻找卵子，然后丢弃这些液体。新方法将液体通过一个设备，该设备基本上像一个迷你弹球机，有一系列保险杠和通道，可以捕捉可能被遗漏的卵子。使用这种技术，科学家们能够为超过一半的患者找到额外的卵子。在一个案例中，其中一个卵子成功导致了怀孕和健康的出生。一位未参与该研究的生殖健康专家告诉《纽约时报》，这表明“这些额外的卵子不是小小的、干瘪的、他们不想要的卵子。它们是可行的。”该专家和其他人表示，这项新研究很有前景，但需要更大规模的研究来证实其结果。该研究背后的公司表示，它正在与**FDA**进行谈判，以获得更广泛部署这种弹球机式设备的批准。同时，该公司表示，生育诊所可以将其作为研究工作的一部分使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: This morning, a group of biotech researchers have published a new study that points to a potentially transformative method of fertility treatment. Many types of those treatments involve retrieving eggs from women. And the more eggs there are, the higher the chances are of getting a viable embryo that could lead to a birth. The researchers discovered though that conventional methods of finding those eggs often miss some, and they've developed a device to collect more of them. Fertility clinics have traditionally used high power microscopes to search for eggs in what's known as follicular fluid, then discarded that fluid. The new method takes the fluid and runs it through a device that's basically like a mini pinball machine with a series of bumpers and lanes that catch eggs that might have otherwise been missed. Using that technique, the scientists were able to find additional eggs for more than half of patients. In one case, one of those eggs led to a pregnancy and healthy birth. A reproductive health expert not involved in the research told the Times that showed that quote, "These extra eggs weren't small shriveled up eggs that they didn't want anyway. These were viable." That expert and others said the new research is promising, though larger studies are needed to confirm the results. The company behind the new findings says it's in talks with the FDA to get approval to deploy that pinball like device more broadly. In the meantime, it says fertility clinics can use it as part of research efforts.

### 奢侈旅游市场

**Reporter**: 最后，说到那个**K型经济**，我们的团队个性化您的每一次旅程，以激发和惊叹您。**奢侈旅游市场**正在蓬勃发展。无论是预订米其林星级餐厅的最后一分钟座位，还是像在斐济海岸与鲨鱼一起游泳这样更刺激的体验。虽然许多人正在削减航空旅行或度假等开支，但超富裕人群（我们说的是3000万美元以上）却在大手笔消费，越来越多的公司希望分一杯羹。在最近于法国戛纳举行的旅游展上，参展商和奢侈旅游顾问的数量是2000年代初期的10倍。日益激烈的竞争基本上引发了一场“奢华有多奢华”的军备竞赛。我们能满足客户最疯狂的奇思妙想？如果您想到的是私人飞机，那您就想得不够大。一些旅游高管分享了客户的故事，比如一位客户希望安排他的儿子在意大利的国家体育场与大牌职业运动员一起踢足球。或者有一次，一位客户因为季风侵蚀了他们租用的别墅附近的海滩而惊慌失措，顾问不得不安排紧急运送沙子。一位顾问说，对他的客户来说，这和任何事情一样，都是关于情感的，他说：“你想感觉比任何人都特别。”

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: And finally, speaking of that K-shaped economy, our team personalizes every journey to inspire and amaze you. The luxury travel market is booming. Whether it's acquiring a lastminute reservation at a Michelin star restaurant or something more thrilling like swimming with the sharks off the coast of Fiji. While many people are cutting back on things like air travel or vacations, the ultra rich, we're talking 30 million plus, are going big and more and more companies want a piece of that. At a recent travel expo in Can France, there were 10 times as many exhibitors and luxury travel advisers than in the early 2000s. The increasing competition has basically set off an arms race of how lux is lux. What wildest whim can we meet? If you're thinking, oh, private jet, you are not thinking big enough. Some of the travel executives shared stories like a client who wanted them to arrange it so his son could play soccer with bigname professional athletes in one of Italy's national stadiums. Or the time a client panicked because a monsoon had eroded the beach near their rented villa in the seells and the adviser had to arrange to have an emergency shipment of sand brought in. One said that for his clients, it's about emotion as much as anything, saying, quote, "You want to feel more special than anyone else."
