### 维系爱情的仪式

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 如果你必须给出一个维系爱情的伴侣仪式，那会是什么？每周一次，告诉你的伴侣你爱他们的三件事，以及他们可以做得更好的三件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: If you had to give one relationship ritual to stay in love, what would that be? Once a week, tell your partner three things that you love about them and three things they could have done better.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 但有些人会想，如果我告诉戴夫我们要开始互相写这些纸条，他会觉得很尴尬，而且不会去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: But some people thinking, well, and if I told Dave that we're going to start writing these notes to each other, he's going to cringe and not going to do it.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 说实话，戴夫说不出他喜欢你的三件事吗？真的吗，戴夫？这要求很高吗？我绝对不相信。更大的问题是，这让你感到不舒服的是什么？你看，我不是治疗师，我是一名离婚律师。我代理一些最杰出的精英、运动员、企业家，他们在这方面和任何人一样糟糕，因为我们内心有一部分害怕去触碰“你爱我什么？”“我做错了什么？”而且这不仅仅是浪漫关系。比如，我妈妈十年前在与癌症长期抗争后去世了。我们之间有很多话需要说，但都没有说。我内心有一部分希望她还在，这样我就可以为我做错的一些事情道歉。但我们不这样做，因为人们只是不想忍受暂时的不适。所以我认为爱、承诺、说“我会给他们伤害我的机会”这些事情都非常需要勇气。这很可怕，但我很勇敢。你知道，你的婚姻会结束。它以死亡或离婚告终。而对于两个在关系结束时能说出“这个人帮助我成为了最真实的自己”的人来说，这是你能给予另一个人类最大的礼物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Honestly, Dave can't name three things he likes about you. Really, Dave? Is that a big ask? I absolutely call bull on that. The bigger question is what's uncomfortable about that for you? And look, I'm not a therapist. I'm a divorce lawyer. I represent some of the most high achieving minds, athletes, entrepreneurs, and they're just as bad at this as anybody because there's a part of us that's afraid to poke at what do you love about me? What am I getting wrong? And it's not just romantic relationships. Like, my mom died 10 years ago after a long battle with cancer. There was a lot between us that needed to be said and wasn't said. And there's a part of me that wishes she was here so that I could have apologized for some things I got wrong. But we don't do that because people just don't want temporary discomfort. And so I think there's something deeply courageous about love, about commitment, about saying I'm going to give them the opportunity to hurt me. Like it's scary, but I'm brave. You know, your marriage will end. It ends in death or divorce. And for two people at the end of their relationship to say, "This person helped me become the most authentic version of myself." That's the greatest gift you could give to another human being.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 正如你从这张照片中看到的，我刚刚向我的未婚妻求婚了。我想听听如何才能不把事情搞砸的建议。如果我的未婚妻最终来到你的事务所，她很可能来那里的原因是什么？我将要面对一个女人，她要和一位优秀的供养者、优秀的保护者离婚，而她来找我的首要原因是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And as you can see from this photo, I just proposed to my fiance. I'd like some advice on how not to mess this up. Like if my fiance ends up walking into your practice, what is the reason she's likely to end up there? The number one reason that I'm going to have a woman sitting across from me, divorcing someone who's a great provider, great protector is

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 这对所有人来说都不是显而易见的，而且这会让我一辈子都有生意可做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: that is not obvious to everybody and it'll keep me in business for the rest of my life.

</details>

### 爱的社会现状

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: **詹姆斯**，正如你从这张照片中看到的，我刚刚向我的未婚妻求婚了，她欣然答应了。我请你来这里，部分原因是我希望得到一些关于如何不把事情搞砸的建议，因为我以前和你聊过，大约有50%的人在求婚后最终会以某种方式把事情搞砸。不过，在我们深入探讨这个问题之前，在你帮助我弄清楚如何维系爱情、不把事情搞砸之前...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: James, as you can see from this photo, I just proposed to my fiance and gladly she said yes. So, I've brought you here in part because I'd like some advice on how not to mess this up because I know from speaking to you previously about 50% of people that get down on their knee end up messing it up in some way. Before we get into this though, and before you help me figure out how to stay in love and not mess it up.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 从社会角度来看，你认为我们对爱的看法、我们维系、寻找和理解爱的能力处于什么阶段？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Where do you find us at as it relates to love as a society? If you were to zoom out and diagnose society's relationship with the subject of love and their ability to keep it, find it, and understand it, where are we?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我认为我们作为一个文化正处于一个非常不舒服的时刻。我认为我们比任何时候都更渴望感受到真正的连接。我认为我们厌倦了仅仅盯着屏幕。我认为我们走出疫情时，有一种感觉，好吧，我希望与其他人一起生活在这个世界上，感受真实的人的温暖。然而，我们在寻找连接和保持连接方面，拥有的有效工具越来越少，这两者是完全不同的技能。但我们比以往任何时候都更渴望它。所以我们比以往任何时候都更饥渴，却不知道如何“烹饪”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I think we we're in this really uncomfortable moment as a culture. I think we we want more than anything to feel real connection. I think we're sick of just looking at screens. I think we came out of the pandemic with a feeling of, okay, I want to be in the world with other people and feel the warmth of real people. And yet, we have an increasingly lower number of useful tools in finding connection and staying connected, which are two totally different skills. And yet we're yearning for it more than ever. So we're more hungry than we've ever been and we have no idea how to cook

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 在你看来，因为你见过太多人离婚和关系破裂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: in your head because you've seen so many people go through divorce and relationships fail.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 一定有一份我可能会搞砸的事情清单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: There must be a sort of checklist of things that I'm likely to mess up.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的，我的意思是，首先，当我得知你订婚的时候，我非常高兴，因为我总是为人们加油。我真的是。我总是为爱加油。所以我想在我们之前的谈话中，你显然是一个非常深情的人，而你找到了这个人，对我来说，这是最美好的事情。我认为，从本质上讲，这是你最喜欢的人。我实在想不出比这更美好的事情了。就像你看着一个人说：“你是我最喜欢的人。”而那个人也看着你说：“你是我最喜欢的人。”而且你知道这是真的。当他们说的时候，这是真的。这对我来说，是值得追求的东西。这感觉就像是，如果我努力去争取它，即使失败了，我也会再试一次，因为如果你能找到它，它就是世界上最伟大的事情。对我来说，我不会在你的婚礼上致辞，但如果我致辞，我会说我对你有两个愿望。你知道，你的婚姻会结束。我以前在我们的第一次谈话中就对你说过。每段婚姻都会结束。它以死亡或离婚告终。我希望你的婚姻以死亡告终。我希望当它以死亡告终时，让我们先送你走，当你临终时，她会希望对你说或对周围的人说：“你帮助我成为了最真实的自己，你仍然是我最喜欢的人。”因为我想不出比这更大的祝福了。对于两个人在生命的尽头，在他们关系的尽头，说：“这个人帮助我成为了最真实的自己，他们仍然是我最喜欢的人。”我认为这是你能给予另一个人类最大的礼物。我喜欢这个想法，即使知道这有风险，这可能不会成功，这在统计学上胜算不大，但我还是要尝试一下，因为，你知道，它给我的生活增添了一些东西，我也给她的生活增添了一些东西，而且，你知道，我们要尝试一下。我不知道。我觉得这很美。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. I mean, well, you know, first of all, when I when I knew you, you know, heard you got engaged, I was thrilled because I'm always cheering for people. I really am. I'm always cheering for love. And so I think in our prior conversations, you're obviously someone who loves very deeply and and the fact that you found this person, you know, to me is the most lovely thing. You know, I I think at its core, this is your favorite person. I just can't think of anything more lovely than that. Like the idea that you would look at a person and go, "You're my favorite person." And and that person would look at you and say, "You're my favorite person." And that you would know that it's true. like when they say it that it's true. Like that that feels to me like something worth pursuing. That feels like something that if I tried to get it and I failed, I'd try again because if you could find it, it's just about the greatest thing in the world. Like the the thought to me that, you know, I I I won't get to give a toast at your wedding, but I will say that if I was going to give the toast, it would be that there are two wishes I have for you. You know, your marriage will end. I mean, I've said it to you before in one of our first conversations. Every marriage ends. It ends in death or divorce. I hope yours ends in death. And I hope when it ends in death that let's send you off first that when you're dying that she will say hopefully to you or to those around, you helped me become the most authentic version of myself and you're still my favorite person. Because I can't think of a greater blessing than that. like for two people at the end of their life, at the end of their relationship to say, "This person helped me become the most authentic version of myself and they're still my favorite person." That's the greatest gift you could give to another human being, I think. And I like the idea that even in the face of knowing that this is risky, this is something that may not work, this is something that statistically the odds are against, but I'm going to give it a shot because, you know, there's something it adds to my life and there's something I add to her life and, you know, we're going to we're going to give it a shot. I don't know. I found that very beautiful.

### 离婚律师的视角

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 作为一名离婚律师，同时也是爱情的忠实拥护者，你是否曾试图劝说某人不要离婚？有没有过这样的情况，你审视了局势，然后觉得他们应该复合？是的，我想说的是，我的第一个想法通常是，这个人是否准确地感知到他们所处的境况？所以人们会来找我，他们会说，人们来找我时处于非常不同的情况。有时人们会来找我，他们已经被送达了离婚文件，婚姻已经结束，现在的问题是，好吧，我们必须采取防御性反应。所以你知道，当人们来到我的办公室时，情况通常是如此严峻和破裂，以至于他们是来雇佣我做那个特定目的的。但我会毫不犹豫地说，如果我感觉到这个人会从个人治疗中受益，这可能会帮助他们以不同的方式看待关系，并以不同的方式进入关系，我不会犹豫地推荐他们。还有一些人，这比你想象的更常见，关系中发生了可怕的事情。他们出轨被抓了。他们抓到自己的配偶出轨了。他们失业了，这在他们的关系中造成了巨大的不和。这通常会让我觉得，也许这会受益于心理健康专业人士的干预，或者每个人都深呼吸一下，花一分钟时间，尤其是有孩子参与时，但即使没有孩子也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: As a divorce lawyer who is also a very big fan of love, do you ever find yourself trying to get someone not to get a divorce, has there ever been an instance where you you looked at the situation and thought, you know what, they should just get back together? Yeah. I what I'll say is my first thought is often, is this person accurately perceiving the situation that they're in? So people will come in and they'll say, you know, it really people come to me in very different situations. So sometimes people will come to me and they're they're they've been served with divorce papers like the marriage is over and now it's about okay we have to react defensively. So you know when people come to my office the situation is often so dire and so broken that they're coming in to hire me for that specific purpose. But I will say without question that if I get any sense that this person would either a benefit from individual therapy that might help them view the relationship differently and come to the relationship differently. I will not hesitate to refer them. And then there are people that and it's more common than you'd think that something awful has happened in the relationship. They had an affair and got caught. they caught their spouse having an affair. Uh they've lost their job and it created tremendous discord in their relationship. And that often will feel to me like something that perhaps would benefit from the intervention of mental health professionals or everyone just taking a breath and taking a minute, especially when there's kids involved, but even when there aren't.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你的客户主要是男性还是女性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Are your clients predominantly men or women?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 差不多是各占一半。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: It's pretty much an even split really.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。我代理很多非常成功的高净值人士，或者嫁给他们的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. I represent a lot of either very high achieving high- netw worth individuals or people married to them.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这两类人来找你的原因不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And are the reasons that they come to you, those two different groups, different?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 比如他们想要分居的原因，从根本上来说是不同的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Like the reason why they want a separation, is it fundamentally different?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 就出轨这个具体例子而言，我想说男性比女性更容易被抓到出轨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So the specific example of cheating, I would say men get caught cheating more often than women.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这意味着他们出轨更多吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Does that mean they cheat more?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 不，这意味着他们更容易被抓到出轨。我认为没有人能真正准确地说，我知道人们喜欢统计数据，我知道嘉宾们倾向于出来说，72%的人...我所说的一切都基于我25年来促成婚姻破裂的观察。男性和女性都会出轨。男性出轨的方式比女性更散漫、更愚蠢。根据我的专业经验，当女性出轨时，通常意味着这段关系已经彻底结束了。这段关系已经结束了，这要么是一个软着陆的地方，要么是这个人，这个女人，在她脑海中巩固“是的，这件事已经结束了”的最后机会。而男性，我真的见过数百名男性坐在我对面，他们被抓到出轨，或者感觉到自己即将被抓到出轨，他们对我说：“是的，这和我的妻子无关。我爱我的妻子。这和那无关。我只是，我不知道。我只是不知道我为什么会做我做的事情。我只是做了。”我知道每个人都想，因为在文明社会中，人们会觉得“我不敢相信。怎么会有人说那样的话？”但闭嘴。如果你家里有薯片，你知道你不应该吃它们。你不想吃它们。你想要充满活力的健康。你想要照顾好自己，但它们就在那里。它们就在那里。你是人。就像我能比我的大脑更好地控制我的食物环境。我早上醒来时很有决心。但在晚上7、8点钟，当我有点累，漫长的一天结束后，我值得一些好东西时，如果薯片在那里，我就会吃薯片。我们是人。我们是人。有时我们只是感到孤独、饥饿、愤怒或疲惫，或者这些因素的某种组合。而这种温暖的东西，比如与另一个人的连接，调情的乐趣，感受到自己与你所吸引的任何类型的人之间的能量的兴奋。我认为这很正常。然后问题就变成了你没有考虑这些事情的后果。如果你考虑这些事情的后果，你会做出更好的选择。但我们都知道，纪律就是用你现在想要的东西来换取你最想要的东西。有时很难记住你最想要的东西，并将其保持在你的视线之内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: No, it means they get caught cheating more. I I don't think that anyone could really truly accurately say, you know, I know people love statistics and I know that that, you know, guests have a tendency to come out and say, well, 72% of people who are everything I'm saying is based on what I've observed in 25 years of facilitating the demise of marriages. Men and women both cheat. Men cheat in just more scattershot stupid ways than women do. When women cheat, in my experience professionally, it's usually an indication of like the it's the absolute end of this relationship. The relationship is over and this is either a soft place to land or it's sort of a final opportunity for this person to solidify, this woman to solidify in her head that yeah, this thing is over. Whereas men, I I've really had hundreds at this point of men sit across from me who've been caught in an affair or sense that they're about to get caught in an affair and they say to me like, "Yeah, this had nothing to do with my wife. Like, I love my wife. It had nothing to do with that. It just I don't know. I just I don't know why I did what I did. I just did it." And I I know everyone kind of wants to because in civilized society it feels good to kind of go like I can't believe that. That's how could someone say that? But shut up. Like if you have you have potato chips in your cabinet, you know, you you you know that you're not supposed to eat them. You don't want to eat them. You want vibrant good health. You want to take care of your but they're there. They're there. And you're human. And like I can control my food environment better than my brain. Like I have a lot of resolve when I wake up in the morning. But at about 7 8:00 at night when I'm a little bit tired and it's been a long day and I deserve something nice, if the potato chips are there, I'm eating the potato chips. Like, we're human. We're human. There are times where we're just feeling lonely or hungry or angry or tired or some combination of those factors. and this warm thing like the connection to another person, the the joy of flirtation, the excitement of of feeling the energy between yourself and whatever it is type of person that you're attracted to. I think it's very normal. And then the problem becomes that you're not thinking about the consequences of those things. If you were thinking about the consequences of those things, you'd make better choices. But we all know that discipline is trading what you want now for what you want most. And sometimes it's hard to remember what you want most and to keep it in your line of sight.

### 关系中的“滑坡”

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 那么根据你的经验，如果我的未婚妻有一天来到你的事务所，从她的角度来看，她很可能来那里要求你帮助她结束与我的关系的原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So from your experience, you know, if my fiance someday ends up walking into your practice, what is the reason she's likely to end up there from her perspective asking you to help her get out of the relationship with me?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 最明显的原因，如果你要说最普遍的、统计学上的平均原因，那会是你停止了关注她，停止了注意到她，在**史蒂文**重要的事情清单中，她排在中间偏下。对于像你这样成就斐然的人，对于像你这样有创业精神的人，对于像你这样过着一种生活方式的人，你今天在这边海岸，明天在另一个国家，随时随地飞来飞去，收到各种有趣的邀请，你必须进行优先级排序，因为你不可能做所有你想做的事情。通常会是她觉得自己排名下滑了。我认为这通常不是你所描述的那种生活方式的问题，而是你如何安排时间让她融入其中的问题。因为我确实发现了很多例子，在关系工作中，那些生活中充满这种强度和日程混乱的人，他们的生活是不可预测的，但他们有能力每天早上、每天下午，或者偶尔但持续地对她说：“嘿，我在录音间隙有一分钟时间。我只是想让你知道我在想你。”或者“嘿，你知道吗，我从这里开车到那里时听到了那首歌，它让我想起了你，我等不及下周见到你。”你知道，对我来说，这样的事情有多难？顺便说一句，这不一定非得是全球性的生活方式。它甚至可以是，“嘿，我们有几个孩子和两条狗，你知道，我妈妈病了，我得照顾她，所以我非常忙。”但你如何让你的伴侣知道，“嘿，你仍然非常重要。我们仍然彼此紧密相连”，因为这是头号抱怨。这是头号原因，特别是对于女性来说，我将要面对一个女人，她要和一位优秀的供养者、优秀的保护者，以及所有这些方面都很好的人离婚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: the most obvious, if you're going to be like the most the average, the statistical average, it would be that you've stopped seeing her and stopped noticing her in in the list of things that are important to Steven, that she's somewhere in the middle to bottom of that list. Like for for a high achiever like you, for someone who's entrepreneurial in the manner that you are, for someone who, you know, lives the kind of lifestyle that you do where you're on this coast one day and this country another day and flying here on a moment's notice and getting invitations to interesting things and you have to triage because you couldn't possibly do all the things that you'd like to do. It usually would be that she just feels herself slipping in the rankings. And I think that that is often not a function of what you're like that lifestyle I just described. It's a function of where you take time to fit her into that. Because I genuinely have found tremendous number of examples of people who and this is in the relationship work who have that level of intensity in their life and that level of chaos in their schedule and it's unpredictable but they have that ability every morning or every afternoon or every once in a while but consistently to say hey I have a minute between recordings. I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you. Or hey, you know, I heard that song when I was in the car from here to here and it makes me think of you and I can't wait to see you next week. You know, something like that to me, like how hard is that? By the way, doesn't have to be like a global lifestyle. It could even be, hey, we got a couple of kids and two dogs and you know, my my mom is sick and I got to tend to her so I'm super busy. But how do you let your partner know, hey, you're still really important. we're still really connected to each other because that's the number one complaint. That's the number one reason, particularly with women, that I'm going to have a woman sitting across from me divorcing someone who's a great provider, great protector, great all of those things.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这对所有人来说都不是显而易见的。说实话，对我来说也不一定显而易见。我自然而然的运作方式，这就是我的本性。我与很多朋友聊过，以了解他们如何运作，以及他们的大脑如何工作，那就是当我在这里时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: That is not obvious to everybody. And I'll be honest, it's not it wasn't necessarily obvious to me. The way that I operate naturally, and this is just the way that I am. I've spoken to so many of my friends to understand how they operate and the way that their brain works is when I'm here.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我唯一想的就是这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: The only thing I'm thinking about is this

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 而且我几乎擅长忘记其他一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and I almost I'm remarkable at forgetting everything else

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 并且完全投入其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and and being completely here.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这听起来像是一件好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Now that sounds like a good thing,

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 但这也意味着我可能会失去14个小时，忘记去联系。我可能会忘记，你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: but it also means that I can lose 14 hours and forget to to check in. I can forget, you know.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 当你和她在一起的时候也是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Is it is it also true when you're with her?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。当我们安排好时间的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yes. When we have scheduled the time.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Good.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 所以，当我们安排好时间一起做某事时，我就会在那里。我不会玩手机。我不会做任何其他事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, you know, when we schedule the time to go and do something together, I'm I'm there. I'm not on my phone. I'm not doing anything else.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 很好。我认为这是一个巨大的优先事项。我越来越多地听到人们有这样的感觉，是的，我们在一起，但我们并没有真正地在一起。我们坐在那里，他们却在玩手机或者做其他事情。我认为非常非常重要的是，关系的一个真正重要的方面是，有时间你们彼此给予那种程度的专注。但再说一遍，你知道，这并不是我们必然被教导的东西。我们可能有父母作为榜样，但他们往往不是好榜样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Good. I think that's a tremendous priority. I'm hearing more and more from people the feeling of, yeah, we're together, but we're not together. We're sitting there and they're on their phone or they're doing other things. And I think that it's really really important that one of the really important aspects of relationship be that there is time where you give each other that level of focus. But again, you know, like it's just not something we are necessarily taught. We have maybe we have our parents as models, but very often they're they're not good models.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 有趣的是，出于某种原因，我选择了一个与我性格相反的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What's interesting here as well is for some reason I've chosen someone who's like the opposite of me in terms of the way that I

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 部分原因是因为她，是的，很可能。当我与一些像我一样的朋友交谈时，他们也选择了与自己相反的伴侣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: partly because she Yeah, probably. And when I've spoken to some of my friends who are quite like me, they've also chosen partners who are the opposite of them.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 你能想象吗？我知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Could you imagine? I know.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 你能想象两个你吗？就像想象我跟我自己，你知道，你跟你自己。那会非常激烈。但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Could you imagine two of you? Like imagine me with me, you know, you with you. That would like it would be so intense. But

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 这就是为什么很容易产生误解，因为我们一生都假设对方和我们有相同的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: this is why it becomes so easy to misunderstand because we go through life assuming the other person has the same perspective as we do

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 而且他们对事情的感受和我们一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: and they feel the same way that we do about things. And

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 但解决办法是什么？我不得不学习如何去关心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: but what's the solution to that? I've had to learn to check in.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。但你不觉得她喜欢你这一点吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. But don't you think she loves that about you?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 她喜欢。她今天早上刚给我发了一条信息说：“非常感谢。”因为我这次离开的时候说：“听着，我每天都会和你视频通话。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: She does. She actually just sent me a message this morning saying, "Thank you so much." Because I said when I left this time, I said, "Listen, I'm going to FaceTime you every day,

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 即使只有一分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: even if it's for just one minute."

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以，那不是很可爱吗？你仍在努力弄清楚如何才能做得更好。这太棒了。这是一件美好的事情。你知道，有趣的是，如果我走进你的家，桌上放着**《习惯的力量》**或**《高效能人士的七个习惯》**，我会说：“哦，看看**史蒂文**。他仍然如此成功。他仍在努力磨砺矛尖。太棒了。”你知道，但如果你走进家门，看到一本书，比如**《如何维系爱情》**，你就会说：“**史蒂文**还好吗？一切都顺利吗？关系怎么了？”为什么？为什么我们作为一个社会，不承认我们在这方面有点糟糕？我们不太擅长维持连接。我们不太擅长帮助他人感受被爱，感受值得被爱，以及帮助我们的伴侣感受被爱，弄清楚如何维持连接。也许关键就是那个小小的举动，那一分钟的视频通话，那一分钟的“嘿，也许我们应该试试这个”。你实际上在说什么？你实际上在说的是：“我想做好这份工作。我怎样才能做好这份工作？我怎样才能保持良好？我怎样才能做得更好？”就像我们去面试，我们非常想要这份工作。约会就是这样。约会就是我到处投简历。我到处投简历。我希望能找到一些东西，一些适合我的技能和需求，他们也想要我，我能得到很好的报酬，我能从中得到一些东西，我也能为它付出一些东西，因为我拥有所有的天赋，我拥有所有的这些东西，我想把它奉献给一个有价值的事业，我想为此得到报酬，我想成为某一部分。约会就是一场求职面试，然后你得到了这份工作，一段时间内你会觉得“我得到了这份工作。天哪，办公室太棒了，你应该看看，我完全知道会发生什么，你知道有成长空间。这份工作有成长空间。会很棒的，你知道，我真的觉得有晋升空间。这可能就是这份工作。这可能就是我的事业。这可能就是我的天职。它可能很有意义，很美好。我想我能为之贡献一些东西。”我们都非常兴奋。然后你跳到三年后，我们就会说：“那该死的工作。那份工作。是的。不，我又要去工作了。好吧。我们走吧。”就是这样。你知道，我有一个朋友刚找到一份最好的工作。天哪。他们得到了很棒的工作，我们只想着这些，而不是试图记住，在某个时候，你所处的这段关系曾是你渴望的，就像你有一天会找到一个你最喜欢的人，你也是他们最喜欢的人，你们会彼此扶持，看到彼此的盲点，帮助彼此弄清楚你是谁，并成为那个人，你们会一起成长，一起改变。一些核心的东西会保持不变。一些东西会以美好、有意义的方式改变。你会经历美好的事情，可怕的事情，以及世界上所有抛向你的事情。你再也不会孤单，因为你会拥有这个人。然而，以某种方式，去关心并想做好这份工作，并进行绩效评估，却被认为是有点奇怪的。你管理团队。你管理那么多团队。你多久会说：“我们不需要进行绩效评估？”

**James Sexton**: So, isn't that lovely, though? You're still trying to figure out how can I be better at this thing? And that's amazing. That's a beautiful thing. You know what's so funny is if I walked into your home and on the table there was, you know, **The Power of Habit** by during or **The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People**, I would go, "Oh, look at look at Stephen. He's still so successful. He's still trying to sharpen the point of the spear. Amazing." You know, but if you walk in and you see a book, you know, **How to Stay in Love**, you go, "Things all right with Stephen? Like things going okay? What's going on with the relationship?" Why? Why don't we as a society just acknowledge we're we're kind of bad at this? We're kind of bad at maintaining connection. We're kind of bad at helping like feeling loved and feeling worthy of love and helping our partner feel loved and figuring out how to maintain connection. And maybe the key is that little thing, that one minute facetime, that one minute of saying, "Hey, maybe we should try this other thing." What are you actually saying? What you're actually saying is, "I want to be good at this job. How can I be good at this job? How can I stay good at it? How can I get even better at it?" Like, we go for the job interview and we want this job so bad. Like, that's what dating is. Dating is I'm sending my resume all over the place. I'm sending it all over the place. I hope I can find something, something that suits my skills and my needs and where they want me and I'll be well compensated and I'll get something from it and I'll give something to it because I have all this talent and I have all this stuff and I want to give it to a worthy cause and I want to be compensated for that and I want to feel part of something. That's all dating is is it's a job interview and then you get the job and for a little while you're like I got the job. It's the oh my god you should see the office is amazing and you should and I could I knew exactly what's going you know there's room for growth. There's room for growth in this job. It's going to be great, you know, and I I really feel like there's room for advancement. Like, this could be the job. This could be my career. This could be my vocation. It could be meaningful and wonderful. I think I have something I could contribute to. And we're so excited. And you jump ahead 3 years later and we're like, that job. That job. Yeah. No, I got to go to work again. Like, yep. All right. Here we go. That's it. You know, I got a friend who just got the best job. Oh my god. They had their they got the great and that's all we instead of trying to remember that at some point the relationship that you're in was something you aspired to like the idea that you were someday going to find a person who just was your favorite person and you were their favorite person and you were going to be there for each other and see each other's blind spots and help each other like figure out who you are and be it and that you were going to grow together and change together. And some core things would stay exactly the same. And some things would change in beautiful, meaningful ways. And you'd see each other through amazing things and terrible things and all the things that the world throws at you. You'd never be alone again because you'd have this person like, and somehow it's considered sort of odd to check in and want to be good at that job and have performance reviews. Like, you run teams. you run so many teams. How how often do you go, we don't need to have performance reviews?

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我认为这核心在于，我们可能通过媒体和社交媒体，假设关系应该是毫不费力的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think at the heart of this is we assume probably through media and social media that relationships are supposed to be effortless.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Why?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我不知道，这就像你看到的那样，对吧？我记得，我记得我女朋友前几天告诉我，她说：“哦，我在**Instagram**上关注的这对情侣太棒了。他们简直是完美的一对。”结果发现那个男的在和别人睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I don't just kind of what you see, right? Like I remember I remember my girlfriend telling me the other day, she was like, "Oh, there's this couple I follow on **Instagram** and they're like amazing. they're like the perfect couple and it's just just turned out that the guy is sleeping with someone else.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。我又想，好吧，我女朋友过去5年间通过间接观察那对情侣，可能提高了她对一段关系的期望，因为她只是通过一个二维窗口来看待，但关系中自然存在的混乱却发生在你之外，我们都只有一个二维窗口，就像在**Instagram**上广播关系问题并不能带来关注。不。我还想说的是，你看，我们很多关于一段关系应该是什么样子的观念，都是通过电影和电视中对关系的描绘形成的，对吧？是的。好吧。那么，我们能同意浪漫喜剧或爱情电影基本上就是情感版的色情片吗？它是一种风格化的、截取的谎言，旨在放大事物中最具视觉和情感吸引力或刺激性的方面，比如，是的，有冲突，但它被非常整洁、非常漂亮地解决了。所以这种认为关系应该毫不费力的观念，我认为很大程度上是基于这种感觉，而且，一个故事是喜剧还是悲剧，取决于你在哪里结束故事，对吧？所以，我们总是把故事结束在一个“瞧，他们相爱了，手牵手走开了”的地方。但是，他们走进了生活。他们走进了这个充满复杂性的生活生态系统，有我们无法控制的因素影响着我们的情绪状态、我们伴侣的情绪状态、你、我、和我们。所以有很多事情正在发生，而认为“这应该毫不费力”的想法。其他一切都是大量的工作，而且可能是，顺便说一句，相反的，这毫不费力，而这是一种苦差事，我们倾向于不必要地以这种二元方式看待事物，就像我们作为一个社会在不以二元方式看待一切方面取得了很大的进步，比如性别角色不再那么僵化，你是一个工作者还是一个家庭主妇也不再那么僵化，有一种平衡感。你可以两者兼顾。就像把这些事情看作一个光谱。但是我们仍然非常固守这种观念，认为关系应该是最平稳、最容易的事情，或者关系是辛苦的工作。你不应该总是快乐。如果你认为那就是你，哦，你不快乐。没有人快乐，或者你不应该快乐。那不是婚姻的重点。婚姻的重点是承诺。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. And I thought and again I thought well that watch my girlfriend vicariously watching that couple for the last 5 years has probably increased her expectations on what a relationship should be cuz she's just had this sort of two dimensional window but there was some the natural mess of relationship was taking place outside of you and we all just have the 2D window like relationship problems on **Instagram** broadcasting that doesn't doesn't drive followership. No. And what what what I'll also say is look, we formulate a lot of our conception of what a relationship should look like by portrayals of relationships in film and television, right? Yeah. Okay. So, can we agree that the romcom or the romantic film is basically just an emotional version of pornography? like it's a stylized excerted falsehood that's designed to amplify the the most visually and emotionally compelling or stimulating aspects of things like yes there's conflict but it gets cleaned up very neatly and very nicely like there's it's so this perception that that relationships should be effortless is based I think on largely that which is this feeling that and again whether a story is a comedy or a tragedy depends and where you end the story, right? So, we always end the story in a spot where it's like, "Tada, they're in love and they walk off hand in hand." But, right, they walk off into life. They walk off into this ecosystem of life that's filled with complexity and there's factors beyond our control that are impacting our emotional state, the emotional state of our partner, the you, the me, and the Wii. So, there's a lot going on and and the thought that, well, this should be effortless. everything else is a lot of work and potentially and by the way the opposite like this is effortless and this is a drudgery and we tend to just see things in that binary way unnecessarily like we've made so much progress as a society when it comes to not viewing everything in a binary like there's there's not as much rigidity about gender roles anymore there's not as rigidity about you know are you a worker are you like a career person or a family person like there's a sense of weight. You can kind of be a little bit of both. Like look at these things as a spectrum a little bit. So, but this we're still pretty glued into this idea that like relationships are supposed to be the smoothest, easiest thing or relationships are hard work. You're not supposed to be happy all the time. And shut up if you think that that's what you oh you're not happy. Nobody's happy or you're not supposed to be happy. That's not the point of marriage. The point of marriage is a commitment.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 关系应该是简单的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Are relationships supposed to be simple?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我不知道你说的“简单”是什么意思。容易驾驭吗？不，它们显然不容易驾驭，因为其中56%以离婚告终。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I don't know what you mean by simple. Simple to navigate? No, they're obviously not simple to navigate because 56% of them end in divorce.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 会很难吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Is it going to be hard?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 如果你对“难”的定义是“我必须投入一定程度的注意力”，那么是的，会很难。那很难吗？真的吗？那很难吗？我认为那并不难。投入注意力并不难。记住要投入注意力可能很难，但你不会为自己设置提醒吗？你有很多小工具，难道你不能在一天中设置一些提醒，比如“哦，她，把她放在我的视线之内”吗？再说一遍，这不意味着你不爱她，不意味着她不在你的脑海中。这只是意味着你是一个有动力、勤奋的人。我是一个有动力、勤奋的人。很多时候，我生活中非常重要的事情并不在我的脑海中。但这就是我使用提醒的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: If your definition of hard is I have to pay some level of attention to it, then yes, it's going to be hard. Is that hard? Like, is that hard? Really? Is that hard? Like, I don't think it's that hard. Paying attention isn't that hard. Remembering to pay attention might be hard, but don't you create reminders for yourself? You've got so many gadgets and you can't have some reminder in the day of like, oh her, keep her in my line of sight. Again, it doesn't mean you don't love her, that she's not front of mind. It means you're a driven, hardworking person. I'm a driven, hardworking person. There's tons of times where very important things in my life aren't front of mind. But that's why I use reminders.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 那么，反过来问我一开始问的那个问题，如果我在未来的某个时候来找你，**詹姆斯**，我说：“听着，我需要离婚。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So to invert that question that I asked at the top of this, if I am to come to you at some point in the future, James, and I say, "Listen, I need a divorce."

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 根据我的为人以及这与你所处理的像我这样的客户之间的关联，我可能会给出什么理由？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What am I likely to give as the reason for that based on, you know, who I am and how that correlates to the clients like me that you deal with?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。所以你给出的理由和潜在的根本原因是不同的。你给出的理由会是一个实际的原因，要么是我遇到了别人，要么是她遇到了别人，我们大吵了一架，我说了一些无法收回的话。我在财务上遭遇了惨败，她只是因为看到未来充满不确定性而抛弃了我，或者她做了一些糟糕的决定，做了一些我无法容忍的背叛行为。但再说一遍，那只是表面原因。在这之下是更大的原因，那就是我们迷失了方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. So the reason you're going to give and the underlying reason is different. So, the the reason you're going to give is going to be a practical reason, which is either I've met someone else, she's met someone else, um we've had a terrible fight and uh I've said things that we can't take back. I had a spectacular failure financially and she's just bailing on me because she sees that the future's really rocky or she made some terrible decision and did something awful that's a betrayal that I can't abide by. But again, that's the presenting reason. Underneath that is the bigger reason, which is we lost the plot.

</details>

### 婚姻的意义与承诺

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我们迷失了方向。就像，那是一个故事的一个章节的开始。它是一个章节的结束，也是一个章节的开始。那张照片，那个故事的第一章是这个人与那个人在同一个星球上徘徊，试图弄清楚一切，试图弄清楚他们在做什么。他们有他们的起源故事，他们有他们的，你知道，他们随着时间发展出的互补病理，然后，你知道，他们找到了彼此。世界上有80亿人，不知何故他们的路径相交了，你知道，他们开始有了这种连接，所以有了你，有了我，然后有了我们，那个维恩图就开始了，然后你开始用事物填充它，你用人填充它。你用经历填充它。而这只是旅途中的一站，就像这样。这两个人，这只是一个瞬间。这是一个不可思议的瞬间。它可以像一个高潮。它可以像一个瞬间，有了这个，然后是之后的一切。它是一个标点符号。就像我喜欢说生活有标点符号。比如你有了孩子，你失业了，你找到了工作，诸如此类。那些都是标点符号。这是一个重要的标点符号。它要么是结束的开始，要么是开始的结束。你可以书写它。你可以书写那个章节。但对我来说，这是一个瞬间。之所以这是一个美丽的瞬间，是因为这是一个充满巨大乐观的瞬间。这是一个你们两个人说“你是我最喜欢的人”的瞬间，而且我，我，我希望和你一起书写这下一个章节，它有一个不同的标题。但实际上，标题只是一个象征。戒指只是一个象征。它只是一个承诺的象征。它是一个诺言的象征。而所有的诺言都只是意图的象征。仅此而已。它只是一个意图。我们的意图是，我们不再孤单。我们将一起做这件事。顺便说一句，你已经不孤单了。你达到了这个地步，你会问这个问题，这正是你不再感到孤单的美好印证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: We lost the plot. Like that that's a that's the start of a chapter in a story. It's the end of a chapter and the start of a chapter. That photo like the first chapter in that story was was was this person and this person wandering around on the same planet trying to figure it out, trying to figure out what they're doing. And they have their origin story and they have their you know their complimentary pathologies that developed over time and then you know they found each other. 8 billion people in the world and somehow their paths intersected you know and they started to have this connection and so there was the you and there was the me and then there was the Wii and that ven diagram started right and then you start to fill it with things you fill it with people. You fill it with experiences. And this is just a stop along the way like this. These two people, this is just a moment. It's an incredible moment. It can be like kuman. It can be like a moment that there was this and then everything after this. It's a punctuation mark. Like I like to say that life has punctuation marks. Like you had a kid, you lost your job, you got a job, whatever. Those are punctuation marks. This is a big punctuation mark. And it will either be you know the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You get to write that. You get to write that chapter. But this is a moment for me. The reason why this is a beautiful moment is this is a moment of tremendous optimism. This is a moment where the two of you said you're my favorite person and and I I want to write this next chapter with you as as having a different title in it. But really, like the title's just a symbol. The the ring is just a symbol. It's just a symbol of a commitment. It's a symbol of of a promise. And all a promises is a symbol of intention. That's all. It's just an intention. Our intention is we're not going to be alone anymore. We're going to do this together. And by the way, you're already not alone. The fact that you got to this place that you would ask this question, that that's a beautiful confirmation of the fact that you don't feel alone.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我们会迷失方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: We would have lost the plot.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。是的。你会迷失故事的方向。所以，这是一个故事。这个故事会走向何方？你希望它走向何方？你希望它走向一个未来，有一天你们俩会一起变老。也许会有孩子。也许会有宠物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. Yeah. You would have lost the plot of the story. I So, this is a story. Where does this story go? Where do you want it to go? You want it to go to a future that features the two of you old together someday. Maybe it features children. Maybe it features companion animals.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 那么，我们最有可能迷失方向的原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And what what is the most likely reason that we would lose the plot?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 你停止了关注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: You stop paying attention.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你停止了，你停止了做你现在正在做的事情。你是如何走到这个美好时刻的？你开始做相反的事情。你通过关注走到了这个时刻。你通过把这作为优先事项走到了这个时刻。你通过把这放在心上走到了这个时刻。通过珍视这只是一个象征的东西，你对我来说是有价值的。你为什么要单膝跪地？你为什么要单膝跪地？我的意思是，想想所有这些的象征意义。我们生活在一个符号的世界里。就像我穿的这身衣服，我正在向你表达一些东西。我认真对待这件事。这就是你穿西装的原因。你穿西装是为了表达你认真对待这件事。那么你为什么要这样做？这简单来说是什么？我单膝跪地。为什么？我在你面前谦卑自己。我向你献上一些东西。我希望你会接受我给你的礼物。这象征意义中有些非常可爱的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You stop you stop doing what you're currently do. How did you get to this beautiful moment? You start doing the opposite. You got to this moment by paying attention. You got to this moment by making this a priority. You got to this moment by by keeping this front of mind. By valuing what is this but a symbol of you are valuable to me. Why did you get on one knee? Why do you get on one knee? I mean, think about the symbols of all of this. We live in a world of symbols. Like the outfit I'm wearing, I'm saying something to you. I take this seriously. That's why you wear a suit. is you wear a suit to say I take this seriously. So what why did you do this? What is this as simple? I'm down on one knee. Why? I'm humbling myself in front of you. I'm offering something to you. I'm hoping you will accept the gift I am giving to you. Like there's something very lovely about that symbol.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这就是你所说的“滑坡”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Is this is this what you call slippage?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: “滑坡”正是当你开始无意中，人们很少会有意地出现“滑坡”。通常是，“好吧，我们把那件事搞定了。现在我们可以专注于其他事情了。”那就是“滑坡”。“滑坡”是这些小小的断裂。小小的断裂本身并不意味着什么。就像没有一滴雨水能造成洪水。那一点点雨滴，它只是一点点雨滴。它真的就只是那样。但“滑坡”是这种逐渐增加的小断裂，最终导致了巨大的婚姻杀手，你进来然后说：“这就是我们离婚的原因。”但那不是原因。那是所有这些小碎片造成的，但在某个时候你还在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Slippage is exactly when you start to unintentionally again people rarely have slippage intentionally. It's usually that, okay, we got that knocked out. Now we can focus on the other stuff. And that's slippage. Slippage is these small disconnections. Small disconnections that in of themselves mean nothing. Like no single raindrops responsible for the flood. That little raindrop, it's just a little raindrop. That's all it really is. But slippage is this gradually increasing number of small disconnections that eventually leads to the giant marriage killer that you come in and say, "Here's why we're getting divorced." But it wasn't that. It it was all these little pieces, but at some point you were there.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你认为人们在当下就发现了“滑坡”，但他们认为这不值得争吵或采取行动吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Do you think people spot the slippage in the moment, but they don't think it's big enough to fight about or do something about?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 100%。那就是认知偏差。那就是谬误，它会让我一辈子都有生意可做，因为人们只是不想忍受暂时的不适。就像我们对快乐的渴望与我们对痛苦的厌恶相比，我们对痛苦的厌恶每次都会赢。我们知道这一点。这就是为什么有阿片类药物危机，而不是可卡因危机。因为其中一种是让你感觉非常好，而另一种是消除痛苦。就像人类的欲望，任何科学家都会告诉你这一点，问问我们的朋友**安德鲁·胡伯曼**，问问任何人，他们都会告诉你，人类逃避痛苦的欲望是自我控制的关键方面。所以逃避痛苦，甚至是轻微的不适，甚至是，再说一遍，这是由“爱应该是轻松的”这种叙事推动的。如果你要让它变得不舒服，你一定是做错了。也许你没有和你的灵魂伴侣在一起。你知道，那会是如此轻松和毫不费力。你总是会知道对方想要什么。你永远不必告诉他们。他们会知道。他们会足够了解你，知道你需要什么。他们会理解你。尽管，顺便说一句，真的，我53岁了。我接受治疗20年了。我想我最多只能理解这个家伙70%。就像，我在这里。我在这里，我只能理解这个家伙大约70%。就像，我应该100%理解你吗？因为我们正在交换体液。就像，我应该仅仅因为我们睡在同一张床上，就100%理解你并预知一切吗？我理解我自己也只有70%。那还是经过大量反思的结果。所以，我真的认为我们认为这应该毫不费力，这应该很容易，而且永远不应该不舒服，这是极其不公平的。没关系，就像我，我认为因为我的职业，我整天都必须告诉人们他们不想听的真相。我告诉他们他们需要听的，而不是他们想听的。你知道，当客户在咨询或谈话结束时对我说：“天哪，我感觉好多了。”我总是说：“那太好了。那不是我的本意。”因为我不想让任何我专业交谈的人认为我是在告诉你一些让你感觉更好的事情。我不是来让你感觉更好的。我不是治疗师。我是来告诉你真相的。如果真相让你感觉更好，那太好了。如果真相让你感到不舒服，至少你现在知道了真相。所以，我认为在关系中，再说一遍，如果你最想要的是持久的终生连接，我们尽可能地理解彼此，我们尽可能地帮助彼此驾驭自我和彼此，并且我们不会迷失现在这个美丽故事的方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: 100%. And that's that's the cognitive bias. That's the fallacy that will keep me in business for the rest of my life because people just don't want temporary discomfort. Like our desire for joy versus our aversion to pain, our aversion to pain will win every single time. We know this. That's why there was an opiate crisis more so than a cocaine crisis. Because one of those things is about making you feel really good and the other is about getting rid of pain. Like the the human desire any scientist will tell you this ask our friend **Andrew Huberman** ask anybody they will tell you the human desire to escape pain is the controlling aspect of self. So escaping pain even discomfort even dis and again this is this is pushed by the narrative that love should be easy. If you're going to make if anything's uncomfortable about it, you must be doing it wrong. Maybe you're not with your soulmate. You know, it would be so easy and effortless. You'd always know what the other person wanted. You'd never have to tell them. They would know. They would know you well enough to know what it is that you need. And they would get you. Even though, by the way, really, really like I'm 53 years old. I've been in therapy for 20 years. I get like 70% of this guy, I think, like at best. Like, and I'm in here. I'm in here and I get about 70% of this guy. Like, and I'm supposed to get you a 100%. Because we're exchanging bodily fluids. Like, we're I'm supposed to just cuz we've slept in the same bed, I'm supposed to get you 100% and get ahead of stuff. Like, I get me 70%. And that's with a lot of reflection. So, I I really think that it's wildly unfair for us to to to think that, you know, this should be effortless, this should be easy, and that it should never be uncomfortable. It's okay to be like I I think because of what I do for a living, I have to tell people things they don't want to hear all day because it's true. And I tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear. And you know, when clients say to me at the end of a consultation or conversation like, "Oh my god, I feel so much better." better. I always go, "That's great. That wasn't my intention." Because I don't want anyone I talk to professionally to think I am telling you something to make you feel better. I'm not here to make you feel better. I'm not a therapist. I'm here to tell you the truth. And if the truth makes you feel better, great. If the truth makes you uncomfortable, at least you know the truth now. So, I feel like in relationship again, if what you want most is lasting lifelong connection where we get each other as best we can, we can help each other navigate self and each other as best we can and we cannot lose the plot of a story that is really beautiful right now.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以，我的职业是在法庭上试图操纵人们的情绪状态。那是我的工作。我的工作是让法官喜欢我的客户，不喜欢对方。我希望对方感到害怕。我希望我的客户感到安全。我希望记录员和法警喜欢我，喜欢我的客户，这样当我们休庭时，他们和法官一起回到后台，他们会说：“我喜欢**吉姆**。他是个非常好的律师。”或者“哦，他的客户看起来很好。”或者“天哪，另一个人看起来像个混蛋。”或者“天哪，那个律师是个混蛋。”所以，我在这里操纵人们的情绪状态。那是我的工作。这就是一名庭审律师所做的事情。我们操纵人们的情绪状态。我们玩弄这些杠杆，对吧？所以我这样说，是为了说明我们应该在我们的关系中这样做。这没有什么邪恶的。这些都是工具，你如何使用它们会让你对它是好是坏有一个判断。你看，如果你所做的是为了维持连接，你如何解读它将决定一切。所以，即使你刚才说的那句话，比如，“嗯，关系中好像出了点问题。”好吧，我们已经走上了错误的叙事，因为当有人告诉你某件事做错了时，会有一种自动的防御性反应：“我不是故意做错的，你知道，我做错了也不是我的错。”它会激发出我们内心的防御性，而不是说“有些事情变了。你注意到有些事情变了吗？你注意到我们以前是怎么谈论彼此的吗？你知道，有时，我不知道是不是我做了什么，如果是的话，我真的很感激你告诉我，但最近我们吵架的时候，语气似乎变了。你注意到了吗？还是只有我这样？”现在，这是一种非防御性的对话。我没有指责你什么。我只是注意到有些事情变了。顺便说一句，很好。我们爱彼此。看看那张照片中我们有多爱彼此。把结婚照放在某个地方。看看那个瞬间。我们当时彼此疯狂。我们是对方想要的一切，甚至更多。所以，任何时候，如果有什么事情与此不同了，难道你不想知道吗？难道你不想知道吗？顺便说一句，不是以指责的方式。最常见的是，我们不再像以前那样频繁地做爱了。我们没有做爱。我们很少做爱。我没有像以前那样得到那么多口交。我们没有得到。好吧，有办法像我刚才那样说。那只会让你自讨苦吃。那不会奏效，因为那会变成：“好吧，你也不常在我身边。好吧，我也不常在你身边，因为我工作太多了，我没看到你花钱少了。好吧，你知道，说实话，如果事情发展到那一步，我宁愿花很多钱也不愿你这样对待我。”现在，我们只是在吵架。然而，如果我们说：“哦，还记得我们有多亲密吗？还记得我们出去玩的时候吗？我昨天还在想我们那个周末出去玩的时候。还记得我们甚至没有离开房间吗？那太有趣了。我喜欢我们感觉如此连接和亲密的时候，你知道吗？我感觉，我感觉最近有时我们可能没有那么连接和亲密了，如果我做了什么让情况变成这样，我真的想把它做好。我真的想把它做好。”你知道，道歉在关系中具有巨大的价值，就像律师一样，我会告诉你我的一个商业秘密。你知道，我的工作有时是非常好斗的。所以，有时非常激进是正确的做法。但有时激进并不能解决任何问题。如果我第一次与一位律师互动，这是我从未合作过的律师。所以我们除了名声之外彼此不了解，他们对我非常强硬，我做的第一件事就是道歉。我会说：“你知道，我很抱歉。我只是想说，你的语气，你对我说话的方式，如果我在我们最初的互动中说了什么让你觉得我不尊重你，或者你知道，我不重视你的观点，或者我有时有打断别人的倾向，我有时有，所以如果我冒犯了你，我道歉，因为你对我说话的方式，我感觉我一定说错了什么，或者我一定，所以我绝对道歉，如果我做了什么，他们除了然后说‘哦，不，不，那只是我的语气。我就是那样。哦，是的，当然。’之外，还有什么选择呢？你看，我们都有一个战斗姿态，或者我只是觉得，天哪，这个人对我太强硬了。我感觉我一定无意中说了什么，或者，你知道，然后每个人都平静下来了，你知道吗？”所以我认为这是一种非常简单的方式，可以引发关于这些小型预防性维护的讨论，而不会把它变成一件大事，因为我们又会认为，如果我提出来，就会变成一件大事。它不必变成一件大事。

**James Sexton**: So, what I do for a living in court is I try to manipulate people's emotional state. That's my job. Like, my job is to go and make the judge like my client, dislike the other side. I want the other side to feel scared. I want my client to feel safe. I want the court reporter who's taking things down and the court officer to like me and to like my client so that when we take a break in testimony and they go in the back with the judge, they go, "I like Jim. He's a really good lawyer." Or, "Oh, his client seems so nice." Or, "Boy, the other guy seems like a jerk." Or, "Boy, that other lawyer is a jerk." Like so I'm here manipulating people's emotional state. That's my job. Like that's what a trial lawyer does. We manipulate people's emotional state. We play with the levers, right? So I say this as to say we should be doing this in our relationships. There's nothing nefarious about that. These are tools and how you use them will will give you a sense of whether it's good or bad or what. Look, if what you are doing is to maintain connection, how you parse it is going to be everything. So, even the way you just said that, like, well, something's kind of going wrong in the relationship. Okay, we're already off to the wrong narrative because when someone tells you something's been done wrong, there's this automatic defensive response of, well, I didn't mean to do it wrong and well, you know, it's not my fault that I did it wrong. It brings out something defensive in us rather than saying something's changed. Have you noticed that something changed? Have you noticed that remember when we used to talk to each other about you know sometimes like and I don't know if it's something that I've done and if it is you know I I I really would appreciate you telling me but like when we have been fighting lately like that the tone seems to have changed. Have you noticed that? Is it just me? I now it's a non-defensive dialogue. I'm not accusing you of something. I'm noting that something has changed. And by the way, good. We love each look at how much we love each other in that picture. Like look at put the wedding photos up somewhere. Look at that moment. We were nuts about each other in that moment. We were everything the other person ever wanted and more. So anytime something has changed from that, don't you want to know? Don't you want to know? And by the way, not in an accusatory fashion. The most common one is we're not having sex as much as we used to. We're not having sex. We're not having much sex. I'm not getting as much oral sex as I used to get. We're not getting Okay, there's a way to say that the way I just said it. That's just going to blow up in your face. It's not going to work because it's, well, well, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND AS MUCH. WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND AS much cuz I'm working so much and I don't see you spending less. Well, you know, honestly, if it comes down to that, I'd spend a lot to not have you treat me this way. Now, we're just having a fight. Whereas, if we say like, oh, remember how clo remember when we went away? I was just thinking yesterday about when we went away that weekend. Remember we ended up not even leaving the room? It was so fun. I love when we're like feeling that connected and close, you know? I feel like I feel like lately sometimes like we're maybe not as connected and close like and if there's something I'm I'm doing that's making that like I I really want to get it right. Like I really want to get it right. You know, there's something about apologizing first, like having some humility in relationship that has tremendous value. Like when a lawyer like I'll I'll tell you one of my trade secrets. You know, I my job is a very combative job sometimes. So, there's times where being very aggressive is the right move. But there's times where being aggressive just doesn't accomplish anything. And if I'm interacting with a lawyer for the first time, this is someone I haven't had cases with. So, we don't know each other except by reputation and they come at me really hard, the first thing I'll do is apologize. I'll say, "You know, I I I'm sorry. I just have to say like your tone like you're coming at me like it if I said something in our initial interaction that made you feel like that I didn't have respect for you or that you know I didn't value your perspective or like it I have a tendency to interrupt people sometimes I have a tendency to so if I offended you I apologize because the way that you're kind of talking to me like I feel like I must have said something wrong or I must have so I apologize absolutely if I did what is the per what choice do they have but to then Oh, no, no, that's that's just my tone. That's just how I Oh, yeah, of course. Look, hey, we all have a game face or I just felt like, oh my god, like this guy's coming at me so hard. Like I I felt like I must have said something inadvertently or, you know, and and then everyone's kind of calmer now, you know? So I think that this is a very easy way to invite discussion about these small preventative maintenance things without turning it into a whole like because we again we just think that oh if I bring that up it's going to turn into a whole thing. It doesn't have to turn into a whole thing period.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。是的，我想我问这个问题部分是因为我隐约注意到，当我们七年前第一次见面时，我们更有耐心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. Yeah, I think I asked that in part because I it's something that I I've like subtly noticed that when we were when we first met 7 years ago, we were much more patient.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我想我可能需要进行一次对话，讨论如何在解决问题时恢复耐心。我们现在有点急于求成。我只是觉得，哦，如果你把这个推演下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And I'm like, I probably need to have a conversation about returning to being more patient when we're trying to solve problems. We kind of like rush through them now. And I just I'm like, oh, you play this forward.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你把这个推演下去一二十年。我就会想，天哪，如果我们不放慢速度，我们真的不会擅长解决问题。是的。而且。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You play this forward a decade or two decades. I'm like, damn, we're really not going to be great at solving problems if we don't just like slow down with them. Yeah. And

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 很多时候这意味着更专注地倾听对方的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: a lot of that just means like listening to the other person's point of view a bit bit more intently.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。那很难。那很难，因为你知道你的大脑运转很快。这绝对是我在关系中挣扎的地方。任何一种关系中，我都很像：“好吧，快点。我们得把这架飞机降落。快走。跳到最后。时间就是金钱。我们在做什么？我们要去哪里？”我在这方面很糟糕。我总是打断别人。我在这方面不好。我正在努力改进，因为我以为我知道他们接下来要说什么。但很多时候我错了，尤其是在关系中，我错了。就像，说男人和女人不同，这不是一个受欢迎的观点，但男人和女人就是不同。我这样说并不是为了说一方优越，一方劣等。我这样说只是为了说明我们不同。我们以不同的方式处理事情。我们以不同的方式体验生活。从社会角度来看，我们受到的待遇不同。我们有不同的生活经历，我真诚地相信，在关系中，我们应该思考：“嘿，我并不真正了解这个人是如何运作的。”我花了整整四十年，甚至五十年，才明白，如果我与一个女人处于浪漫关系中，她回家后开始告诉我一些让她心烦的事情，她想要的不是我男性朋友想要的东西。就像如果我打电话给我的一个哥们，如果我打电话给你，我以前给你打过电话。如果我打电话给你说：“**史蒂文**，我遇到了这个问题，伙计。我正在处理我的一个儿子，他正在做XYZ。”我期望如果你说：“那一定很难，**吉姆**。”我会说：“是的，**史蒂文**。所以我才给你打电话。你有什么建议吗？你觉得我应该怎么做？你是个聪明人。我打电话给你是因为我希望你帮助我。”很多时候，情况恰恰相反。大多数女性希望你倾听她们。给予她们一些支持。你们可以进行这样的对话。一对伴侣可以进行这样的对话。你可以说：“嘿，听着。现在，在这一刻，你不是带着问题来找我的。但当你带着问题来找我时，我的自然倾向是开始提出解决方案。我学到了，或者我听**塞克斯顿**在**史蒂文**的节目中说，也许那不是最好的方式。你觉得这是真的吗？比如，你希望我，也许当你谈论这些事情时，我能做些什么？因为，再说一遍，这是一份工作。我想做好这份工作。为什么我问你如何才能更好地完成这份工作是错的呢？”我发现明确地向我的未婚妻说明我在那些情况下的需求非常有用。再说一遍，这对她来说并不自然，反之亦然。就像她在那种情况下需要我做的，与我在那种情况下需要她做的恰恰相反。我特别想到当她经历一些事情，挣扎于一些事情时。她希望我能陪伴在她身边，她通常也希望得到一些建议，而她的建议通常与我的相反。反之，当我在那些情况下时，我实际上根本不想谈论它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. And that's hard. That's hard because you know your your brain moves quickly. Like it's something I struggle with in relationship for sure. Like any kind of relationship is I'm very like all right, come on. We got to land this plane. Like let's go. Like skip to the end. Time is money. Like what are we what are we doing? Where are we going with this? Like and I I'm terrible at it. I interrupt people constantly. Like I'm I'm not good at that. And it's something I'm working on because I I I think I know what they have to say next. And I'm wrong a lot of the time, especially in relationship, I'm wrong. Like it's not a popular opinion to say that men and women are different, but men and women are different. And and and I don't say that to say one is superior and one is inferior. I say that to say that we're different. We we navigate things differently. We experience life differently. We're treated differently from a societal standpoint. We've had different life experiences and I genuinely believe that it would be very valuable for us in relationship to to sort of think, hey, I don't really know everything about how this person is wired. It took me fully 40 some odd years, if not 50, to figure out that if I'm in a romantic relationship with a woman and she comes home and starts telling me about something that's upsetting to her, that she doesn't want what my male friends want. Like if I called a buddy of mine, if I called you, I've called you before. If I called you and I said, "Stephen, I'm having this problem, man. I'm dealing with one of my sons and he's doing XYZ." I ex if you went, "That must be very hard, Jim. I'd be like, "Yes, it is, Stephen. That's why I called you. Do you have any suggestions? Like, what do you think I should do here? Like, you're a smart guy. I called you cuz I wanted you to help me." Very often, that is the opposite. Most women want you to hear them. Give them some support. You guys can have this conversation. A couple can have this conversation. You can say, "Hey, listen. right now in this moment, we're not you're not coming to me with a problem. But when you come to me with a problem, my natural proclivity is to start throwing solutions. And I've I've learned or I I heard Stexton say on Steven's show that, you know, maybe that's not the best way. Do you find that's true? Like, do you want me to maybe like when you say these things, could I because again, this is a job. I want to be good at this job. Why Why is it wrong for me to ask you how to how can I be better at this job? I found it really useful to state explicitly to my fiance what my needs are in those situations. And again, it didn't come naturally to her and vice versa. Like it didn't what she needs from me in those situations is the opposite of what I need from her in those situations. I'm thinking particularly when she's like going through something and she's struggling with something. She wants me to be be present and she um often wants like some advice on it and she and her advice is like the opposite of mine often and in the inverse when I'm going through those situations I actually don't want to talk about it at all.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我只是希望她能在那里。

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 但在那一刻说这些有什么不对呢？我有一个菜单。我有一个菜单给你。你能告诉我你想要哪一个吗？就像你说的，你饿了。我说：“你想吃什么？你想吃寿司吗？你想让我给你做点什么吗？你想吃奶酪吐司吗？你想我们出去找个地方吃汉堡吗？你想要什么？”对吧？你不能直接说：“嘿，我有一个菜单。我可以只听你说，告诉你我爱你，然后就在这里。我可以给你一些解决方案，以及我可能会如何处理这个问题。我可以试着分散你的注意力，给你讲一个我今天遇到的有趣故事，或者我可以抱起你，挠你痒痒。我们可以去另一个房间，在床上翻滚一会儿，让你暂时忘记烦恼，然后我们可以弄清楚你可能想要其他哪些选择。我们可以一起散步，我们可以谈论它，或者不谈论它。你想要菜单上的什么？因为我为你提供了所有这些。你想要哪一个？”她最糟糕的回答可能是：“我不知道。”然后你说：“好吧，那我来选一个。我来选一个。如果感觉好，那太好了。如果不好，你会告诉我，好吗？我不会生气。”再说一遍，那需要多长时间，**史蒂文**？30秒。30秒。把它说出来。就像那样。那比盲目地向目标投掷飞镖，却不知道目标在哪里要好得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: But what but what would be wrong with saying in that moment? I've got a menu. I've got a menu for you. Can you tell me which one you want? Cuz just like just like you said, you're hungry. And I said, "What are you hungry for? Do you want sushi? Do you want me to make you something? Do you want some cheese toast? Do you want us to go out someplace and we can get burgers? What is it you want?" Right? Couldn't you just say, "Hey, I've got a menu. I can just listen and tell you I love you and just be here. I can give you some solutions and and how I might handle the problem. I can try to distract you and tell you a funny story about something that happened to me today or I can pick you up and tickle you. We can go in the other room and roll around in the sheets for a little while and take your mind off it and then we can figure out which of the other options you might want. We can go for a walk together and we can talk about it or not talk about it. What would you like on the menu? Because that's I'm serving all of those things for you. Which one would you like? And the worst thing she could say is, "I don't know." And you go, "Okay, then I'm going to pick one. I'm going to pick one. And if it feels good, great. And if it doesn't, you'll tell me, okay? And I won't be offended." Like again, what' that take, Stephen? 30 seconds. 30 seconds. Throw that out there. Like that. That's instead of just blindly throwing darts at the target, not knowing where the target is.

### 维系爱情的每周仪式

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 如果你必须给所有听众一个伴侣仪式，你认为哪个仪式最能增加他们在一起、相爱的可能性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: If you had to give everybody listening one relationship ritual that you would think would most increase the probability that they stay together, stay in love.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 那个伴侣仪式会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What would that relationship ritual be?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我认为每周一次，你应该专门做一件事，告诉你的伴侣你真正喜欢他们的三件事。而且每周都应该有所不同。如果你真的想尝试这个的进阶版，如果你想把它从一个30秒的任务变成一个你投入到关系中的整整五分钟，我认为你应该告诉你的伴侣。你知道，我对关系维护的感觉，就像你可能听过**达赖喇嘛**的故事，他被认为是这样说的。一位高端主管，你知道，支付了巨额金钱，才得以与**达赖喇嘛**私下会面。**达赖喇嘛**对他说，你知道，如果你在寻求内心平静，你应该每天冥想15分钟。那位主管说，我每天没有15分钟时间冥想。他说，那么你应该每天冥想一小时。我也有同样的感觉。如果你每周没有五分钟时间投入到你的配偶或伴侣身上，那么你将需要数小时。我认为你应该实际预留数小时。就像每周五分钟，我建议以下这个确切的、系统化的基本方法。这就是我下一本书的主题。它讲述的是一种系统化的方法，让你擅长爱。我的想法是，我认为每周一次，这是进阶版，但最少只需写下来，发一封电子邮件，发一条短信，无论是什么，告诉你的伴侣你爱他们的三件事。进阶版是，告诉你的伴侣你爱他们的三件事。告诉他们本周有三次他们让你感受到了被爱。这是你本周做的三件事，让我感受到了被爱。就像，当你给我发那条信息说，那让我感到非常柔软，那让我感受到了被爱。无论是什么，我相信你都能立刻想到她本周做的三件事，让你感受到了被爱。而且现在才周一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I think that once a week you should make a specific task of telling your partner three things that you really like about them. And every week it should be something different. I think you should tell your partner if you really want to want to take the advanced edition of this. If you want to turn it from a 30- secondond task into like a whole five minutes that you devote to your relationship, you know, I feel about relationship maintenance the way that if you've ever heard the story, I think the **Daly Lama** is the one credited with saying it. That's that a high high-end executive, you know, paid a colossal amount of money to have a private audience with the **Daly Lama**. And the **Daly Lama** said to him, you know, um, if you're searching for inner peace, you should meditate for 15 minutes a day. And the executive said, I don't have 15 minutes a day to meditate. He said, then you should meditate for an hour a day. I feel the same way. If you don't have five minutes a week to devote to your spouse or partner, then you're going to need hours. I think you should actually set aside hours. Like five minutes a week, I would suggest the following exact s just systematic basic thing. This is what my next book is about. out. It's about a systematic approach to being good at love. And the idea is once a week, I think here's the advanced version, but minimum just write down, send an email, send a text, whatever it is, tell your partner three things that you love about them. The advanced version is tell your partner three things you love about them. Tell them three times this week that they made you feel loved. Here's three things you did this week that made me feel loved. Like here's three. When you sent me that message and said that made me feel so soft, that made me feel very loved. Like whatever it is, I'm sure you could find off the top of your head three things that she did this week that made you feel loved. And it's only Monday.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 正在听的听众中，有些人现在正处于恋爱关系中。他们听到你这样说，但有些人仍然不会去做。你认为他们为什么不会去做？他们内心在进行什么样的对话？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: People at home are in relationships right now. They're hearing you say that and some of them are still not going to do it. Why do you think they're not going to do it? Like what is that mental conversation they're having where they go?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我认为我们，我认为他们认为这毫无意义。我认为他们可能处于关系中的一个阶段，觉得这有什么意义呢？我们已经走得太远了，这不会有帮助。我认为，最重要的是，我对此的真实感受，我认为人们不想大声说出来的秘密是，我认为我们很害怕。我认为我们很害怕。我认为我们害怕的不是我们关系的未来。我认为我们害怕的是我们觉得自己不值得被爱。我认为这是大多数人最根本的恐惧。我认为大多数人最根本的恐惧是，如果你了解我，你就不会爱我。如果你能看到我，真正的我，就像我内心深处的我，所有的弱点，所有的恐惧，所有可怕的自私想法，所有的变态，所有我内心深处以及我们每个人内心深处最黑暗的东西，如果你能看到这些，你就不可能爱我。随之而来的感觉是，你爱的是我扮演的角色，那个没有向你展示所有这些东西的角色。我只是向你展示我最好的一面。如果你看到真正的我，你就不会真正爱我。我认为我们最大的恐惧是我们不值得被爱。我认为我们内心有一部分害怕去触碰“你爱我什么？”“我爱你什么？”“我做错了什么？”再说一遍，就像完成那个练习一样，你知道，这里有一些事情。这里有三件我爱你的事。这里有三件你本周做的事让我感受到了被爱。这里有三件我可以做得更好的事。或者告诉我三件我可以做得更好的事。或者告诉你的伴侣三件他们可以做得更好的事。然后如果你想加入一个有趣的问题，因为我认为你应该以有趣的事情结束，这里有三件你本周做的事让我想要和你做爱。

**James Sexton**: I think we're I Well, I think we're I think they think it's pointless. I think they they might be at a point in their relationship where it feels like what would be the point we're so far gone it wouldn't help. I think more than anything my my real feeling on this the secret that I don't think people want to say out loud I think we're terrified. I think we're terrified. And I think what we're terrified of is not is not the future of our relationship. I think what we're terrified of is that we we feel like we're not worthy of love. I think it's most people's fundamental terror. I think most people's fundamental fear is that if you knew me, you wouldn't love me. If you could see me, the real me, like the me that's in here, all the weakness, all the fear, all the horrible selfish thoughts, all the perversity, all the all the darkest things that are inside of me and every single one of us that if you could if you saw that, you couldn't possibly love me. and the feeling that comes with that which is so you love the character I'm playing that's not showing you all those things. I'm just I'm just showing you the best parts of myself. If you saw the real me, you wouldn't really love me. I think our greatest fear is that we're not worthy of love. And I think that there's a part of us that's afraid to like poke at what do you love about me? What do I love about you? How how what am I getting wrong? Like again, like finishing that exercise, you know, here's some things. Here's three things I love about you. Here's three things you did this week that made me feel loved. Here's three things I could have done better. Or tell me three things I could have done better. Or tell your partner three things they could have done better. And then if you want to have a fun one thrown in there, cuz I think you should end on fun stuff, here's three things you did this week that made me want to have sex with you.

**Steven Bartlett**: It is uncomfortable for some people, isn't it?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的，对某些人来说非常不舒服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah, it's very uncomfortable for some people.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 很有趣的是，你可能与某人处于一段充满爱的关系中，但在更深层次上却害怕亲密。说实话，因为只有我和你，没有人会听到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It's quite interesting that you could be in a loving relationship with someone, but also be at some deeper level scared of intimacy. And I'll be honest, because it's just me and you, nobody's listening.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 当然。当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Sure. Of course.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我认为在某种程度上我一直害怕亲密。这听起来比实际更有意识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think at some client privilege. Yeah. I think at some level I've always been scared of intimacy. It makes it sound more conscious than it is,

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 但在某种更深层次上，我一直，我不知道，在亲密关系方面有点疏离，当涉及到能够表达这些事情时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: but at some deeper level I've always been, I don't know, a bit disconnected intimately when it comes to like uh being able to articulate

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我们把它简单化。这就是我为什么要把它简单化的原因。我没有问“你对我的爱根植于什么？我们连接的本质是什么？它如何融入更广阔的背景？比如我从小与母亲的关系非常具有挑战性，我觉得你填补了一些伤口，伙计们，我们不需要像**西格蒙德·弗洛伊德**那样出现在关系中，现在我们就可以做，在这段关系中，我喜欢你的三件事是什么？你和我之间有哪些经历让我们彼此开怀大笑？我们有友谊。顺便说一句，那是一种怎样的快乐啊。坐在一个人对面说：“你知道我喜欢你什么吗？”伙计。我想听听那个清单。那很可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: these things. We keep it simple. That that's why I want to keep that simple. I didn't say what is what is your love for me rooted in and what is the nature of our connection and how does it fit into the broader context like I had a very challenging relationship with my mother growing up and I feel like you fill some of the wounds that guys we don't need like **Sigman Freud** doesn't have to show up in the relationship what are three we could do it right now in this relationship what are three things I like about you what are three experiences you and I have had with each other that made each other laugh. Like we have a friendship. Like what a joy that is by the way. Like what a joy it is to sit across from someone and say, "You know what I like about you?" man. I I want to hear that list. Like that's lovely.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你认为人们回避型和焦虑型的整个想法，你知道，这种依恋风格等等。你认为这些东西与你所看到的相符吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Do you think the whole idea of people being avoidant and sort of anxious? You know, this attachment style and stuff. Do is that does that stuff track to what you've seen?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。但你知道，我也认为，我不明白为什么我们对待与他人的连接与对待其他事情不同，比如锻炼。锻炼。好吧。有一段时间没去健身房了。你去健身房，你会感到酸痛。你不能举重很多。你必须慢慢开始。几天之内，你会感到酸痛。如果你说：“哦，我太酸痛了。我不会再去健身房了。”好吧，那么你永远不会变得健康，你永远不会度过酸痛阶段。因为如果你说：“我等一个月，然后再回去做同样的事情。”你猜怎么着？你只会，你必须通过不舒服的部分，才能到达感觉真正好起来，不再那么酸痛的部分。是的，你有时仍然会酸痛。你可能有点用力过猛了。也许那周和**胡伯曼**一起锻炼了。但你知道吗？其他几周，你会说：“嘿，我不觉得酸痛。我只是觉得强壮和健康。”所以，会有一些时刻，这可能会感觉有点奇怪。它可能有点尴尬。它可能有点酸痛。可能有些周，这种简单的小练习会感觉有点，哦，有点不舒服。或者，是的，你本周做的让我感受到被爱的事情清单，我必须努力去寻找。好吧，太好了。难道这种有点不舒服的对话不能防止“滑坡”吗？难道这种小小的对话不比你们之间距离逐渐拉大，最终变得无法逾越，因为它变成了你们之间的鸿沟所带来的长期影响更好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: It does. But you know, I I also think too like I don't understand why we treat our connections to other people differently than things we are like exercise. Exercise. Okay. Haven't been to the gym in a while. You go to the gym, you're going to be sore. You're not going to be able to lift a lot. You're going to have to start slow. And for a couple days, you're going to be sore. And if you go, oo, I that was I was very sore after that. I'm not going back to the gym. Okay. then you're never going to get fit and you're never going to get past the sore stage. Cuz if you go, I'll wait a month and then I'll go back and do the same thing again. Guess what? You're just going to You have to move through the uncomfortable part to get to the part where it starts to feel really good and you're not as sore. Yeah, you'll sometimes still be sore. You pushed it a little too hard. Maybe worked out with **Huberman** that week. But you know what? Other weeks like you go, "Hey, I don't feel sore. I just feel strong and healthy." So, there's going to be moments where this might feel a little weird. It might feel a little awkward. It might feel a little sore. There might be weeks where that kind of a simple little practice feels a little like, oh, it feels a little uncomfortable. Or, yeah, the list of things that you did this week that made me feel loved, I have to reach for it. Okay, great. Isn't that little uncomfortable conversation that might prevent slippage? Isn't that little conversation better than the long-term impact of having a distance start growing between the two of you that eventually becomes impossible to navigate because it becomes a chasm between the two of you?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你认为依恋风格理论有任何真实性吗？从你所看到的来看？你是否倾向于发现有些人回避亲密，有些人焦虑，有些人介于两者之间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Do you think the attachment style theory has any truth to it from what you've seen? Do you tend to find people are, you know, there's some people that are avoidant of intimacy, there's some people that are anxious, there's some people in the middle.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。我的意思是，你看，我认为我们都是我们成长的产物，我认为我们很多，我作为一个53岁的接受治疗的男人，惊讶地发现我的很多挑战都根植于七岁的**吉姆**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. I mean, look, I I think that we're all creatures of our our upbringing, and I think a lot of our I'm amazed as a 53-year-old man in therapy how often a lot of my challenges are rooted in seven-year-old Jim.

</details>

### 自我认知与寻求帮助

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 作为一个如此多谈论爱的人，我很好奇你仍然在哪些方面挣扎，你知道，因为我，我的意思是，我从自己的经验中知道，我可能知道所有的一切，我每天都和专家坐在一起。我并不是不知道这些东西。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: As a man that talks so much about love, I'm I'm curious to know what it is that you still struggle with in terms of, you know, because I I mean, I know from my own experience that I can know every I can know so much. I sit here with experts all day every day. It's not like I don't know this stuff. Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 但付诸实践是另一回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: But then putting it into practice is a different task.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。我的意思是，这就是为什么你永远不会听到我用我自己和我的关系作为例子，因为我认为你可以在理论上是一个非常熟练的人，但在实际应用中，你会有自己独特的挑战。我认为用你自己和你的关系作为例子是危险的，因为我在自己的职业生涯中学到了这一点，当时我经历了一次非常友好的离婚。所以我的离婚经历是我前妻和我以及我们独特情况的独特功能，这些情况把我们带到了现在。所以如果我以此作为我分析事物的基础，我认为这是一个非常浅薄的样本量。我知道对我来说，我在我所有关系中，甚至在我的职业关系中，最大的挑战是承认我需要帮助。我认为因为我是在一个很多需求没有得到满足的环境中长大的。我父亲是一个非常严重的酒鬼。我母亲试图照顾一个非常严重的酒鬼。当我需要什么的时候，即使是很小的时候，我也会感到很多羞耻，因为它没有得到满足，你知道，我早餐饿了，当然，让我给你做些早餐，而是被回应：“什么？你不能自己做早餐吗？你怎么了？”那是我，那是我，**李小龙**海报，我的是**查克·诺里斯**在那里。是的，这大概是九岁的时候，冲绳刚柔流空手道。这是我的房间。是的，我非常，非常孤独。我真的很孤独。我真的很悲伤。我喜欢武术，因为那里有一种非常清晰的阳刚之气，就像这种保护性的、强大的超能力，你可以建立起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. I mean, it's why you'll never hear me use myself in my relationships as an example because I think you can be, you know, an incredibly skilled person at at the theory of something and then in its practical application, you have your own unique challenges. I think that using yourself as the example and your relationships as an example is dangerous because I I learned it in my own professional life when I had a very friendly divorce. And so my experience of divorce is the unique function of the constitution of my ex-wife and of me and of our unique circumstances that brought us where we are. So if I use that as the basis for my analysis of things, I think it's a very shallow sample size. I I know for me my greatest challenge in every relationship I've ever had, but even in my my professional relationships is acknowledging when I need help. I I think because I was raised in an environment where a lot of my needs weren't met. My father was a very serious alcoholic. My mother was trying to tend to a very serious alcoholic. when I needed something even from a very young age I I felt a lot of shame because it wasn't met with you know I'm hungry for breakfast like of course let me make you some breakfast it was met with what you can't make your own breakfast what's wrong with you and I it was this guy yeah that was me that was me **Bruce Lee** poster and my was **Chuck Norris** up there um yeah this is probably like nine nine years old Okinawa and Goju Ryu karate. This is my room. Yeah, I was very um very lonely. I was really lonely. I was really sad. And um I loved martial arts because there was this very clear kind of masculinity on display, like this protective, strong superpower that you could build.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 这不是天生就有的。你没有赢得基因彩票。你可以通过纪律和练习，拥有这种超能力，让你感到安全，那就是我痴迷于拥有的东西。我内心深处仍然有很多那个年轻人，他害怕寻求帮助。我希望成为一个可以为自己做所有事情的人。我希望我能回顾过去说，那是因为我的天性就是非常自我实现，但实际上，那只是因为我非常悲伤和害怕，如果我寻求帮助，我会被羞辱，如果我说“你能对我好一点吗”，答案会是否定的。所以我学会了做所有事情，比如我做饭非常好。我擅长很多事情。我擅长大多数事情。几乎任何我用心去做的事情，我都能做好。但我花了很多年才明白，尽管这对我很有帮助，它建立了我的事业，以及成功和财务成功带来的安全感，以及现在某种程度的声望。我花了很多时间才明白，那也是我生命中最大的障碍。我正在53岁时学习，这个家伙仍然在那里，一直在和我说话。我现在通过自己的治疗学会了对他说：“哦，我听到你了。我听到你了。我很高兴你还在那里。你不再需要那么害怕了。”我不是，我感激他。我认为这是最好的目标，就是与它和平相处。就像我确定在你内心深处，有一个小男孩躲在房间的某个角落，感到非常迷失和孤独。我认为承认那仍然是你脑海中的一个声音，没有什么不对，没有什么软弱，没有什么不阳刚，没有什么不坚强。承认你脑海中的那个声音，它把你带到了现在，但它也以某种方式阻碍了你。你永远无法摆脱它。但也许你会做的是，听清楚它是什么，它是一个曾经在那里非常重要的声音，是为了拯救你。它做得非常好。但现在没关系了。没关系了。你不必把它从你身上打掉，但你也不必听从它。你不必让它来开车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: It wasn't just gifted to you. like you didn't win the genetic lottery. Like you could through discipline and practice you could have this superpower that would make you feel safe and and that was what I obsessed about having. There's still a lot of that that person that young man still in me that is afraid to ask for help. I wanted to be someone who I could do do it all for myself. And I I I wish I could say looking back that it was because that was my natural proclivity is to want to be very self-actualized, but it really was that I was just absolutely sad and terrified that if I asked I'd be shamed if I said like could you be nice to me that the answer would be no. So I learned how to do everything like I cook amazingly well. like I'm good at a lot of things. I'm good at most things. Almost anything I put my mind to I'm good at. But it took me a lot of years to figure out that that although that has served me really well and it's built my career and the security and safety that came with being so successful and having financial success and you know now some level of notoriety. It took me a long time to figure out that that also has been the greatest obstacle in my life. And I it it I'm learning at the age of 53 that this guy is like he's still there and talking to me all the time. And I've learned now again through my own therapy to say to him like, "Oh, I hear you. Like, I hear you. I'm glad you're still there. Like, you don't have to be so scared anymore. I'm not I'm grateful to him. I think that's the best thing to aspire to is to make peace with that. Like I'm sure in you there is some little boy like hiding in some part of his room feeling very lost and very lonely. And I don't think there's anything wrong or weak or not masculine or not strong about acknowledging that that's still a voice in your head. And acknowledging that that voice in your head, like it it brought you where you are, but it also held you back in some ways. And you're never going to get rid of it. But maybe what you'll do is hear it for what it is, which is is it's a voice that was once there really important to save you. and it did a really good job of that. But that it's okay. Like it's okay. You don't have to beat that out of you, but you don't have to listen to it either. You don't have to let it drive the car.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 他们心里没有那么多仇恨。他们讨厌午睡。这就是清单的结尾。其他一切，他们都只想爱彼此，拥抱彼此，玩耍。当他们觉得自己伤害了某人时，他们会停下来，非常害怕，因为他们不是故意的。然后我们变成了这些总是互相攻击的生物，你知道吗？我认为归根结底，我们想要的只是那个。我们想要的只是像我们自己那样温暖、开放的版本，在世界把我们打垮之前。也许这就是爱应该有的样子。也许爱就是我们重新连接到我们内心深处那个如此简单的部分的机会。我只是想让你爱我。我希望被你爱。我希望你觉得自己值得我的爱。我希望我值得你的爱。为什么非要这么难呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: they don't have all that hate in their heart. They hate naps. It's the end of the list. Like everything else like they just want to like love each other and hug each other and play. And when they like think they hurt someone, they stop and they're very scared cuz they didn't mean to. And then we turn into these creatures that are just attacking each other all the time, you know? And I think at the end of the day, like all we want is that. Like all we want is to just be like that warm, open version of ourselves before the world beat the out of us. And maybe that's what love's supposed to be. Like maybe what love is is an opportunity for us to like reconnect to that part of ourselves that was just so simple. Like I just want you to love me. I want to be loved by you. I want you to feel worthy of my love. I want to feel worthy of yours. Like, why does it have to be so hard?

### 逃避感受与成瘾

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我在想，嗯，有很多人在很小的时候就不得不非常独立，无论出于什么原因。也许父母不在身边。也许在你的情况下，你知道，我听过，你知道，做这个播客，你会得到一些模式识别，你有时会想，哦，好吧，如果父母中的一方是酒鬼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I was thinking about how um there's a lot of people that at a very early age had to be very independent for whatever reason. Maybe a parent wasn't around. Maybe in your case, you know, I've heard, you know, doing this podcast, you get a bit of pattern recognition where you you sometimes think, oh, okay, so if one of the parents was an alcoholic,

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 酒鬼的成年子女，我记得读过**《康复：酒鬼的成年子女》**这本书，我在大学时在一家书店偶然发现的，我记得读完后想，他们是不是在读我的日记？天哪，因为那里有一个关于酒鬼成年子女的类型之一，原型之一的描述，那就是你，是的，控制，控制。就像想要控制一切，因为当你和一个酒鬼住在一起时，生活会感到如此混乱。当那个本应是你主要照顾者和让你感到安全的主要机制的人变得不可预测和混乱时，那就会在你内心产生一种持续的、高度的、你知道，高度的“我需要尽可能紧紧抓住”的感觉，那也驱使你变得极其独立。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: adult children of alcoholics were were I remember reading the book **Recovery, Adult Children of Alcoholics**, I stumbled on it when I was in college in a bookstore and I remember reading it and going, have they been reading my diary? Like what the holy because there was this profile of like one of the types one of the archetypes of adult children of alcoholics is that you yeah control control like wanting to control everything because life feels so chaotic when you live with an alcoholic. When the person who is supposed to be your primary caregiver and the primary mechanism for you to feel safe feels unpredictable and chaotic and that is that creates in you this constant sense of a heightened you know heightened sense of I need to hold on as tight as I can and also that drove you to be incredibly independent.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 独立和连接似乎处于光谱的两端。我之所以这样说，部分原因是我看到。

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 总的来说，如果我们从独立和依赖的角度来看这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And generally if we zoom out on this point of independence and dependency

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我想说，过去一二十年，社会上的叙事一直倾向于颂扬独立，而不是依赖。依赖是不酷的。就像“做自己的老板，自己创业，自力更生”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I would say that the narrative in society over the last I know 10 20 years or whatever has been pointed at glorifying independence and not dependency. Dependency is like not cool. It's like be your own boss start your own business down on your own two feet.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。是的。我以前认为，我想说我三四十岁时的决定性特征是，我相信存在两个版本的**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**。一个是我当时最外向的一面，那就是冷酷无情和唯利是图。就像我，我，我将做好这份工作。我将把它做得非常好。我将越来越擅长它。我将把我的技能武器化，那就是我将成为的样子。然后我内心还有另一部分，它一直都在那里。我把它藏在衣柜里一段时间，那一部分在谈论爱时会眼眶湿润，想到狗会哭泣，你知道，看**《爱在光谱中》**时，每集都会哭三四次。就像我内心这个非常柔软、温柔、充满爱心、富有同情心、善解人意、敏感的部分。我觉得它们是两种交战的力量。有两个版本的我。问题是，我如何才能打败那个柔软的小懦夫，成为最终形态，那就是像一台机器一样的我，可以做任何需要做的事情，并且以别人无法做到的方式去做。我很幸运，在我的职业领域，我就是**马友友**在大提琴领域一样，就像在法庭上，我拥有天赋。我记得当时想，好吧，那就是我的最终形态，一个法庭大师，其他一切都只是我需要做什么才能达到那里。我记得我前妻对我说，你知道，你永远不会像爱法律一样爱任何女人。就像你余生遇到的每一个女人，都将是次要的，因为你太爱在法庭上了。你在法庭上很棒，但你在客厅里却不知道该做什么。就像在你的客厅里，你完全瘫痪了。然而在法庭上，你知道每一个，它有明确的规则。它有节奏。我知道目标是什么。就像我确切地知道，那是受控的混乱。我很擅长。所以，我内心有一部分想，好吧，我有这个柔软、温暖、美好、可爱、善解人意的一面，然后还有这个真正成功的一面，而后者把我带到了所有地方。它让我拥有了我拥有的一切。所以我必须弄清楚如何摆脱前者，保留后者。就像，在我整个三十多岁和大部分四十多岁的时候，我的主要任务就是试图弄清楚如何摆脱我内心那一部分。无论我如何大声播放**九寸钉**的音乐，戴着耳机，试图变成一台机器，我就是无法摆脱我内心那一部分。然后我开始意识到，我认为部分原因是因为这项工作。我认为是因为我不知何故偶然进入了一个需要大量谈论感受的境地。不知何故，我被请来，说：“这里有一个有趣的离婚律师，他将谈论离婚的事情。”结果不知何故，却大量谈论了爱、柔软、温暖和同情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. Yeah. I so I used to view I would say the defining characteristics of my 30s and 40s was the belief that there were two versions of **Jim Sexton**. One was the one that was the most forward- facing at that time which was lead pipe cruelty and mercenary sensibility. Like I'm I'm I'm going to do this job. I'm going to do it really well. I'm going to get better and better at it. I'm going to just take my skill set and weaponize it and that's who I'm going to be. And then there was this other part of me that was always there. I kind of stuffed it in the closet for a while that like gets misty eyed when I talk about love and cries when I think about dogs and, you know, watches **Love on the Spectrum** and can't make it through an episode without weeping three or four times. Like this very soft, gentle, loving, compassionate, empathetic, sensitive part of me. And I felt like they were two waring forces. There were two versions of me. And the question was, how can I beat that soft little, you know, wuss out of me and be the final form, which is like the me that's a machine that can just do it like that can just do what needs to be done and do it in a way that nobody else can do. And I'm very blessed that I am in my line of work. what **yoyo ma** is in cello like in a courtroom I have a god-given talent and I remember thinking okay that's the final form of me is a master in the courtroom and and everything else is just what do I need to do to get there I remember my ex-wife saying to me you know you will never love any woman as much as you love the law like every woman who you ever meet for the rest of your life will be playing second fiddle to how much you love being in a courtroom. You're great in a courtroom and you have no idea what to do in your living room. Like in your living room, you're just totally paralyzed. Whereas in a courtroom, you know every it has why it has defined rules. It has a cadence. I know what the goal is. Like I know exact it's controlled chaos. I'm great at it. So there was a part of me that went, okay, there's this soft, warm, wonderful, lovely, empathetic side of me, and then there's this real successful, and that's the one that got me everywhere. That's the one that got me everything I have. So I have to figure out how to get rid of this one and keep this one. Like, and for my entire 30s and most of my 40s, that was my primary thing was trying to figure out how to get rid of that part of me. And no matter how loudly I blared **9-in nails** on on on on my headphones and tried to become a machine, I couldn't get rid of that part of me. And then I came to realize, I think in part because of this work. I think because of like somehow I stumbled into being in a position where I end up talking about feelings a whole lot. And it's somehow I I I got brought in to have go here's this interesting divorce lawyer who's going to talk about divorce stuff and somehow ended up talking a lot about love and softness and warmth and compassion.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我不认为那是偶然的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I didn't think it somehow

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。不，没错。我从中学会了，从表达那个声音中学会了，实际上并没有两种交战的力量。它们是自我中两个非常真实的方面，必须在我内心共存。它们彼此以某种方式相互创造。就像我认为如果我没有巨大的敏感性和同情心，并且不能设身处地为房间里不同的人着想，我就不会成为一个那么好的律师和法庭辩护人。所以我认为，当我们开始把我们身上看似矛盾的特质，看作是我们真实自我的真实体现时，我们必须学会如何让它们共舞，以某种方式共同前进。有时这个人应该主导。有时那个非常专注的自我，那个你知道的，非常使命驱动的人，应该主导。特别是对于男性来说，我们被教导一种僵化。男性的性别角色具有巨大的僵化性。我的意思是，我成长在一个时代，你只能选择成为**克林特·伊斯特伍德**或**理查德·西蒙斯**。你只有这两个选择。你要么是100%冷酷无情，要么是温暖模糊，但那样你就不是真正的男性。我认为情况并非如此。你看，我在巴西柔术垫上度过了20年。我必须告诉你，有些家伙可以用拇指轻松折断你的脖子，但他们也是最温暖、最可爱的人，因为这些都是真实自我的各个方面。知道我内心那个柔软温暖的部分，滋养它，让它花些时间，让它参与对话，这让我变得更好。它让我更真实。它让我在这方面做得更好。顺便说一句，让那一部分展现出来，并没有削弱这一部分。所以当你开始以这种方式看待它时，我真的认为有更多更广阔的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. No, exactly. And what I came to learn from that from from giving that voice is that there actually isn't two waring forces. It's two very authentic aspects of self that have to exist inside of me. And each one of them creates the other in some ways. Like I don't think I'd be anywhere near as good of a lawyer and courtroom advocate if I didn't have a tremendous sensitivity and empathy and couldn't put myself in the heads of the various people in the room. So I think that when we start to see what seems like opposite traits in us instead as authentic representations of aspects of who we are that we have to learn how to do let them dance, let them move together in some way. And there's times where this guy should take the lead. And there's times where that very focused self that you know is very missiondriven, that person should lead. And and for men in particular, like we've been taught a rigidity. Like the gender role for men has a tremendous rigidity. I mean, I grew up in a time where you either got to be **Clint Eastwood** or **Richard Simmons**. Those were your two choices. You either had to be, you know, like icy 100% or you had to be, you know, you could be warm and fuzzy, but then you were just not really masculine. And I just don't think that's the case. Like you look at like I've spent 20 years on the Brazilian jiu-jitsu mat. I have to tell you like there are some dudes could snap your neck with like any with their thumb and they're some of the warmest most lovely people because these are all authentic aspects of self. And to know that like the soft warm version of me feeding it, letting it spend some time letting it be in conversation, it it makes me better at the other part. It makes me more authentic. It makes me better at that part. And by the way, letting that part out, it hasn't done anything to diminish this part. So when you start to see it that way, I I really think that there's a tremendous broader menu of possibilities out there.

### 为什么爱如此重要

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我生命中有几个朋友在关系和爱情方面真的很挣扎。对于所有那些在爱情中真正挣扎的人，他们环顾四周，看到其他人似乎都解决了问题，或者至少正在努力解决问题，但他们看着自己，然后说：“这对我就是行不通。怎么回事？为什么我的朋友圈里只有我一个人没有找到爱情，或者没有恋爱？”他们因此自责。我认为那是一个很好的起点。为什么会发生在我身上？然后开始审视它是什么时候开始发生的，以及贯穿始终的一致线索是什么，有没有我可以问这个问题的人，他们了解我，爱我，并且愿意诚实地告诉我，如果没有，那太好了，有哪些资源可以提供其他人的智慧，他们可能也有类似的经历。我认为有很多切入点可以与自己进行这种对话。我认为首先要认识到，是的，我正在溺水。那么解决方案是什么呢？不是假装一切都很好。这就是我们创造的生态系统。我们正在过着我们的搞笑片段，看着别人的精彩集锦。我们整天被鼓励告诉所有人我们做得有多好，我们如何大获成功，我们感觉有多棒，我们有多专注。为什么？因为我们害怕，如果我们说：“我不知道。我感觉自己有时在溺水。我有时会感到如此井井有条，然后又会感到自己在溺水。”顺便说一句，当人们有这种诚实的时候，那真是太美了。我必须告诉你，人们对我说的一件事是，当我说“我不明白我说的任何话为什么会引起共鸣”时，人们会说：“老兄，你太真实了。太真实了。太直白、太诚实、太真实了。”这存在于我们每个人身上，那种真实性，那种基本的东西，就是大声说出来：“是的，我不知道。我不知道。我没有完全搞清楚。”这没关系，因为我确实搞清楚了一些事情。所以也许如果我搞清楚了这些事情，而你搞清楚了其他事情，我们只是停止互相吹牛五分钟，而是说，你知道，我在这方面做得很好，但在这方面我感觉一团糟。我认识的每一个成功的朋友，每一个名人朋友，我都有一些朋友，人们看着他们会说：“哦，老兄，他简直太厉害了。”就像你我的朋友。人们看着你，他们会说：“他太厉害了。”你生活中有一些方面你会说：“我得努力改进。”我生活中有太多方面我会说：“我得努力改进。”我搞清楚了所有其他事情，但我还没有搞清楚那个。你知道吗？进行那样的对话真是太可爱了。为什么我们不能都为那样的对话多留出一点空间呢？我认为那并不难。它至少和我们的锻炼习惯一样重要。它至少和记住别人的生日一样重要。

**James Sexton**: I've got several friends in my life that have really struggled with relationships and love. And uh for all those people that have really really struggled in love and they look around at everybody else and everybody else seems to have worked it out or at least be working through a situation but they look at themselves and go, "It just doesn't work for me. What's going on? Why am I the only one in my friendship group that hasn't found love or isn't in a relationship?" And they kind of beat themselves up about it. I think that's a great starting point. Why is this happening to me? and start looking at when did it start happening and what's the consistent thread through all of it and are there people that I could ask that question of who know me and love me and would be willing to tell me honestly and if there aren't great what are some resources out there in terms of the wisdom of other people that might share that experience I think there's so many entry points to that conversation with yourself I think the start is to identify that yeah I'm drowning like what here's what the solution is not is to pretend everything's fine. And that's the ecosystem we've created. We're we're living our gag reel and watching everyone's greatest hits. And we're encouraged all day long to tell everyone how great we're doing and how we're crushing it and how great we feel and how focused we are. Because why? Because we're terrified that if we said, "I don't know. I feel like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm drowning sometimes. I have moments where I feel so put together and then I have moments where I think I'm drowning. And and by the way, when people have that kind of honesty, there's something so beautiful about it. Like I have to tell you, like one of the things that people say about me when I go, I don't understand why anything I'm saying resonates with anybody. People are like, "Dude, you're so real. It's so real. It's so blunt and honest and like real." This is it's in every one of us is that same realness, that same basic just all it is is just saying out loud like, "Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Like, I don't have it all figured out." AND THAT'S OKAY CUZ I HAVE SOME THINGS really figured out. So maybe if I've got these things really figured out and you've got these other things really figured out and we're just stop bullshitting each other for five minutes and instead go, you know, I'm doing great on this, but like this I feel like I'm a train wreck on. Like every high achieving friend I have, every celebrity friend I have, every per I have friends who people look at them and go, "Oh, dude, he is murdering it." Like you're my friend. People look at you, they go, "He's murdering it." There are aspects of your life that you're like, "I got to work on that." There's tons of aspects of my life where I go, I got to work on that. Like I I figured all these other things out, but I haven't figured that out yet. And you know what? It's so lovely to have that conversation. Like why why can't we just make some space for that all of us a little bit more? I don't think it's that hard. It's at least as important as our workout routine. It's at least as important as remembering someone's birthday.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。我，我，我不知道为什么，我不知道为什么我们，嗯，现在很少有空间来解决我们的连接挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. I I I wonder why that I wonder why it is that we um there's so little space for us to work on our connection challenges these days.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 它没有被优先考虑。我们变成了我们所关注的。我们优先考虑我们被告知要优先考虑的事情。我们被告知要优先考虑炫耀性消费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: It hasn't been prioritized. We become what we behold. We prioritize what we've been told to prioritize. We've been told to prioritize conspicuous consumption.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我们被教导衡量一个人的标准是他们拥有多少经济上的成功。这就是为什么我真诚地相信，如果我们继续沿着这条路走下去，以经济成功高于一切，实际上是消费、我们拥有什么、我们穿什么、我们有什么或我们看起来怎么样，对吧？作为优先事项，我们将一无所获。然而，如果我们改变这一点，说，嘿，比如快乐、平静、在我们内心找到一些平静，找到一些对我们个人来说感觉正确的平衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: We've been taught that the measure of a person is is how much financial success they have. That's why I genuinely believe that if we continue to barrel along using this the metric of success being financial above all else really consumption, what we own, what we wear, what we have or how we look, right? as the priority, we're barreling towards nothing. Whereas if we were to change that and say, hey, like joy, peace, finding some peace within ourselves, finding some balance that feels right to us individually.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我认为这是一个非常好的简单词，人们在思考他们生活中的成功KPI时没有足够多地思考它，那就是“我感觉如何？”我认为我们都在不同的环境中长大，学会了忽略自己的感受，取而代之的是把“世界如何看待我”作为主要衡量标准。我前几天还在想，实际上，你知道，我们可以去做所有这些播客、书籍等等，但我们都生来就带有一个内在的指南针，每天都会告诉你你的感受，但我们没有人去倾听它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think that's a really good simple word which people don't think about enough when they're thinking about the KPIs of success in their life, which is how do I feel? And I think we've all grown up in different contexts learning to tune out of how I feel and in its place put how does the world feel about me as like the primary metric. And it's like I I was thinking the other day that actually, you know, we can go do all these podcasts and books and whatever else, but we were all born with this sort of internal compass that tells you every day how you feel, but like none of us tune into it.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。是的。实际上，衡量标准变成了你拥有多少粉丝？你有多富有？你如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. Yeah. And actually the metric becomes like how many followers do you have? How rich are you? How

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 它被世界从我们身上打掉了。我，我，我告诉你，你总是能从我这里得到最感性的东西，**史蒂文**。我将告诉你我作为父母最羞耻的时刻。我有两个儿子。他们分别是26岁和28岁。28岁的儿子刚刚在九月结婚。他是一名律师。他很棒。他当时一定五六岁。发生了一些事情，他开始哭泣，好像有人伤害了他的感情，或者发生了什么，但这对我来说当时并不是什么大事。我的意思是，我当时二十多岁，他出生时我24岁，所以是的，我当时二十多岁，他哭了，他哭了，我希望他停止哭泣，因为看到他哭让我很难过，我非常爱他，所以我觉得看到他哭让我非常不舒服。我记得我抓住了他，不是粗暴地，我抓住了他，我看着他，我说：“控制你自己。”我说：“控制你自己。”我说：“冷静下来，控制你自己。”我记得他，他设法做到了。那是二十多年后的事了。我为那一刻感到羞耻。因为我明白我当时想对他说什么。我当时想对他说，我不想让你痛苦。我对他痛苦感到不舒服。我还想对这个家伙说一些话，大概是：“伙计，如果世界知道你有很多感受，它就不会对你友善。你必须找到一种方法来隐藏它。”那一刻发生了很多事情。但当我回顾那一刻时，我只是觉得，不，那是我做错的事情。那是我做错的事情。我认为我们不应该告诉人们，不仅仅是男孩，也许男孩尤其如此。但我不认为我们应该告诉人们“控制你自己”。“停止感受那么多。”我认为，我认为，我认为试图让人们控制自己的感受，与不让一切都受你时时刻刻的短暂感受所支配之间是有区别的。我认为这是一个更难、更微妙的信息。但我想，如果我们以感受为主导，如果我们首先深入感受，如果我们首先识别感受，如果我们弄清楚我们想要感受什么，我们希望对方感受什么，把它带回到婚姻中，带回到连接中，我之前问的那些问题，那个练习。你本周什么时候让我感受到了被爱？这是你本周做的一些让我感受到了被爱的事情。这是你本周做的一些让我对你产生欲望的事情。这是你本周做的一些让我感受不到被你爱，或者让我感受不到与你连接的事情。也许我们只是需要帮助彼此学习如何识别和感受我们的感受。也许我们更需要**罗杰斯先生**，而不是，你知道，激烈的自助。也许我们只是需要更多的帮助，不是试图控制我们的感受，而是弄清楚它们是什么并感受它们。我认为，你知道，我们很多人都在分散自己的注意力，以此来避免感受任何东西，因为我甚至在思考一个实际的方法，让你重新接触到你真实的感受。是的。

**James Sexton**: it's beaten out of us by the world. Like I I I will tell you, you always get the most emotional stuff out of me, Stephen. I will tell you my most shameful moment as a parent. So I have two sons. They're 26 and 28. 28-year-old just got married in September. He's a lawyer. He's awesome. He must have been five or six. and something happened like and he was he started crying like someone hurt his feelings or something happened but it wasn't I don't know it wasn't that big of a deal like it it to me at the moment I mean I was in my 20s he was 24 when I I was 24 when he was born so yeah I was in my 20s and he was crying he was crying and like I wanted him to stop crying because it made me sad to see him cry like I love him so much like that I was like it made me so uncomfortable able to see him crying. And I remember I like I like grabbed him, not roughly, I grabbed him and I just looked at him and I was like, "Control yourself." I'm like, "Control yourself." I'm like, "Calm down and control yourself." And I remember like he he managed to do it. It's 20some years later. Like, and I I'm ashamed of that moment. because I understand what I was trying to say to him. Like I was trying to say to him, I I don't want you to be in pain. Like I'm uncomfortable with your pain. I also wanted I wanted to say something to this guy probably which is like dude like the world's not going to be nice to you if it knows that you have all these feelings. Like you got to find a way to hide it. There's so much going on in that moment. But like I look back on that moment and I just think like no like that was the wrong thing to do. Like it was the wrong thing to do. Like I don't think we should be telling people not just boys like boys particularly maybe. But I don't think we should be telling people like control yourself. Like stop feeling so much. Like I think I think I think there's a difference between trying to like get people to control their feelings and not letting like everything be governed by the transient feelings that you have from moment to moment. And I I think it's a harder more subtle message. But like I think fe if we lead with the feelings, if we lean into the feelings first, if we identify the feelings first, if we figure out what it is we want to feel, we want the other person to feel to bring it back to marriage to bring it back to connection that what were the questions I was asking earlier that that exercise. When did I make you feel loved this week? Here's some things you did that made me feel loved this week. Here's some things that made me feel desire towards you this week. Here's some things you did this week that made me feel less than loved by you or that made me feel less connected to you. Like what? Maybe we just need to help each other learn how to identify our feelings and feel our feelings. Like maybe we need more **Mr. Rogers** and less, you know, intense self-help. Like maybe we just need more help not trying to control our feelings, but just figure out what they are and feel them. I think, you know, a lot of us are distracting ourselves as a way to avoid feeling anything because even I was thinking about like a practical way for you to get back in touch with actually how you're feeling. Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我想到的每一个解决方案都被厄运打断了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And every solution I came up with was like interrupted by doom.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 好吧，我听过最好的成瘾定义来自治疗师**戴夫·克鲁格曼**，他说，成瘾是你为了逃避感受，而做任何事情，如果你什么都不做，你就会感受到什么。我总是对人们说，工作是我最喜欢的麻醉剂。就像如果你看看我生命中最富有成效的时期，它们几乎总是在我个人生活中发生可怕事情的时候。要么我正在离婚，要么我母亲正在去世，要么发生了一些痛苦的事情。所以我从掌控感和能力感中获得了巨大的安慰，这就是我在工作中感受到的。所以，我工作越多，通常就越能衡量我生活中哪些方面我不想感受某些事情。再说一遍，这就是为什么我认为治疗开始时最好的问题，实际上是唯一的问题，就是我害怕感受什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Well, the best definition of addiction I've ever heard was from a therapist **Dave Klugman** who said to me, um, addiction is anything you do to get away from feeling what you would would have felt if you'd done nothing at all. And I've always said to people, work is my favorite narcotic. Like if you look at the most productive times in my life, they were almost always when something awful was happening in my personal life. Either I was getting divorced, my mother was dying, some some painful thing was happening. So I took tremendous comfort in feeling in control and competent, which is how I feel at work. So the the more I'm working is usually a gauge of of where there are aspects of my life that I don't want to feel certain things. And again, that's why I think that the the best question to ask at the start of therapy, the only question really, is what is it I'm afraid to feel?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我想因为我们即将结束这个关于在爱情中挣扎的人的部分，所以值得总结一下，告诉他们为什么他们应该认真对待爱情，停止分散注意力，停止逃避它，停止避免接受治疗。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think because we're closing off on this section where we were talking about people who have struggled in love, it is probably worth just closing the section by giving them a why as to like the the reason why they should take love seriously and stop distracting themselves and stop avoiding it and stop avoiding going to therapy,

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 把它藏在地毯下。

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 而且，你知道，变得富有，拥有漂亮的房子，美好的假期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And, you know, get rich, nice house, nice holidays.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。那些都是很棒的事情。那些都是值得追求的。我认为当你回顾你的人生，无论你处于人生的哪个阶段，大多数人都会回忆起他们感受到爱，或者感受到巨大爱意的时刻，作为他们人生中最高光的时刻。我认为即使是名声，我代理过很多名人，现在像你一样，我也尝到了一点点。那真的只是陌生人的赞美。就像陌生人的爱，那很可爱。那很可爱。就像甜味剂。它很甜。它不是糖，但它很甜。就像，被陌生人爱戴感觉很好。那很可爱，你知道吗？但它和真正了解你，与你有着共同历史，并且真正爱你的人的爱一样吗？我认为我们所有人都知道，如果我们诚实的话，当我们回顾人生中那些我们最庆幸自己活着的时刻，通常是那些让我们感受到被爱，或者我们能够去爱别人的时刻，或者理想情况下是两者的结合。所以我认为浪漫的爱是一个很好的机会，你不必是一个有宗教信仰的人，因此相信婚姻是一种圣礼，你被召唤去创造孩子。你不必是一个相信婚姻对社会有益的人，因此我们必须这样做，如果你爱**美国**或你爱**英国**，你就必须为国家这样做。它真的可以只是审视你作为人类的自身经历，审视你自己的感受，然后说：“好吧，我什么时候真正感受到被爱？我什么时候感受到爱？那些是我人生中最高光的时刻吗？那些是我人生中最美好的时刻吗？”你刚才描述的很多其他事情，比如假期，通常不是独自一人。通常是和别人在一起。通常是和某人在一起。即使是短暂的爱，也是与另一个人的某种连接。所以更大的问题是，是，是，是那种伴侣关系中独有的爱，对吧？你找到一个人，然后让那个人成为你的人。那种排列组合对你来说有效吗？我认为有很多人尝试过，但失败了。大多数人尝试过，但失败了。解决办法是放弃它吗？我不这么认为。我认为解决办法是弄清楚它什么时候有效，因为它有效的时候，它就太好了，对吧？去和任何真正拥有过一段伟大、成功、长期关系的人聊聊。再说一遍，即使它最终结束了，即使“从此幸福快乐”意味着“从此各自幸福快乐”。如果你生命中有10年、20年，你与另一个人感受到了深刻、美妙的亲密连接，以及极大的性满足，以及所有其他事情，就像，你知道，最好的情况，对吧？就像你结婚了，好吧，如果你有一段一夫一妻制的婚姻，我愿意相信你只会和你想睡的女人睡，那会是一个。她只会和她想睡的男人睡，那会是一个。因为当我饱了，我就不饿了。我不需要再吃东西了。就像当我满足了，我就不需要更多了。如果一夫一妻制婚姻的目标，如果传统婚姻的目标是我们要彼此说：“嘿，你和我，我们将分享空间。我们将一起走过一段旅程。我们将在彼此的生命中扮演非常重要的角色。我们将为此添砖加瓦。这里有浪漫和性的成分，这使得它不仅仅是友谊，大多数婚姻中，你都在说我们将只与彼此分享自我的那个方面。好吧。所以如果那是你想要的，而从中产生的是，你知道，你想要感受到的东西，那就是我想要感受到深刻的连接。我想要感受到一种越来越深的连接。我想要在这段关系中感到安全。情感上，身体上，我想要在其中感到安全。我只是认为大声地从一开始就彼此说出这些，并彼此说：“我们能做些什么来，如果我们都决定要这样做，我们不必这样做，但我们要做。我们如何才能让这件事保持美好和连接？”我认为答案真的没有那么复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I think when you look back on your life, whatever stage of your life you're in, most people will recall a moment where they felt loved or where they felt tremendous love as the highest points of their life. I I think even celebrity and I represent a lot of celebrities and now like you I've had a little taste of it. That's really just the praise of strangers. It's like the love of strangers, which is lovely. It's lovely. It's like neutrieet. It's sweet. It's not sugar, but it's sweet. Like, feels good to have strangers adore you. It's lovely, you know? But is it the same as having someone who genuinely knows you and has a history of with you and really loves you? Like I think all of us know if we're honest that when we look back on our life at the moments where we felt the most glad that we're here, it was usually something that we felt that made us feel loved or that we got to feel loved towards someone else or or ideally a combination of the two. So I think romantic love is a great opportunity and you don't have to be someone who's religious and therefore believes that marriage is a sacrament that you're called to for the purpose of creating children. You don't have to be someone who believes that you know marriage is good for society and therefore that's why we have to do it is if you love **America** or you love the **UK** you have to do this for the country. It really can just be to look inside your own experience as a human being and look inside your own feelings and say, "Okay, when have I felt truly loved? When have I felt love? And were those the highest moments in my life? Were those the best moments in my life?" A lot of those other things that you just described like holiday, it's usually not by yourself. It's usually with other people. It's usually with someone. Even if it's transient love, it's some kind of connection to another person. So the the bigger question is is is the unique form of love that that comes with a pair bond, right? I you find one person and you make that person your person. Like is that the permutation that works for you? And I think there are a lot of people who try at that and fail. The majority of people try at that and fail. Is the solution to that to give up on it? I don't think so. I think the solution to it is to figure out when it works because when it works, it it's so good, right? Talk to anybody who's really had a great successful long-term relationship. Again, even if it eventually ends, even if you know, happily ever after means happily ever after separately. If you had 10, 20 years of your life where you felt deep, wonderful intimate connection with another person and great sexual satisfaction and all kinds of other things like you know at best right like you're you're getting married okay and if you have a monogous marriage I would like to think that you will sleep with as many women as you want to which will be one and she will sleep with as many men as she wants to, which will be one. Cuz when I'm full, I'm not hungry. I don't need more to eat. Like when I'm satisfied, I don't need more. Like if if the goal of a monogous marriage, if the goal of a traditional marriage is that we're going to say to each other, "Hey, you and I, we're going to share space. We're going to share a journey together. We're going to play a very important role in each other's lives. We're going to add to that. there's this romantic and sexual component which makes it something other than a friendship and most marriages you're saying we're going to only share that aspect of self with each other. Okay. So if that's what you want and what comes from that is you know something you want to feel and that is I want to feel deeply connected. I want to feel a connection that gets deeper and deeper. I want to feel safe in this relationship. Emotionally, physically, I want to feel safe in it. Like, I just think that there's tremendous value in saying that out loud to each other from the beginning and saying to each other, what can we do to to if we both have decided this is something we're going to do, we don't have to do it, but we're going to do it. How can we keep this thing lovely and connected? And I I think the answer really is not that complicated.

**Steven Bartlett**: Do you think I should get a prenup?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yes, of course.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你为什么认为我应该签婚前协议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Why do you think I should get a prenup?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 你有婚前协议吗？它要么由州立法机构撰写，要么由你和她撰写。你更信任谁？你去过车管所吗？你走进车管所然后说：“哦，这些人太棒了。他们应该负责一切。”我的意思是，你知道吗？他们应该为我们的婚姻制定规则。顺便说一句，即使这个立法机构不断变化，无论你是谁，无论你的政治观点如何，在过去的20年里，你总会在某个时候说：“我简直不敢相信现在掌权的是谁。我简直不敢相信现在掌管政府的是谁。”无论你属于哪个阵营。所以你所说的，因为你的婚姻有婚前协议。你结婚了，你签了婚前协议。你是在说，我更信任我们未来居住州的立法机构，以防我们分手，而不是我从80亿个选择中选出的伴侣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: You have a prenup? It'll either be written by the state legislature or it'll be written by you and she. Who do you trust more? You've been to the DMV. Have you walked into the DMV and went, "Oh, these people are great. They should be in charge of everything." I mean, you know what? They should make the rules for our marriage. And by the way, even though this legislature changes constantly, like whoever you are, whatever your political views are, in the last 20 years, at some point you've gone, I cannot believe who's in charge here. I cannot believe who's in charge of the government. Whatever side of the aisle you're on. So what you're saying cuz your marriage has a prenup. You get married, you've got a prenup. You're saying I trust the legislature of the state in which we will be residing in the future in the event we break up more than I trust my partner who I've chosen out of 8 billion options.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我想很多听众会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I imagine a lot of people listening would

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 害怕向伴侣提及婚前协议。

**Steven Bartlett**: be scared to mention a prenup to their partner.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 顺便说一句，那些人尤其如此，就像我说的，你知道，我每天没有15分钟时间冥想。太好了。你需要一个小时。如果你害怕向你的伴侣提及婚前协议，那么你绝对应该向你的伴侣提及婚前协议，因为那意味着我害怕与我的伴侣进行艰难的对话。如果你要结婚，你应该习惯进行艰难的对话。生活会很快地向你袭来。会发生很多事情，需要进行艰难的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: And those people in particular, by the way, it's just like I said about, you know, I don't have 15 minutes a day to meditate. Great. that you need an hour. If you'd be scared to mention a prenup to your partner, then then you should definitely mention a prenup to your partner because what that means is I'm afraid to have a hard conversation with my partner. And if you're going to get married, you should get accustomed to having hard conversations. Life is going to come at you very fast. And there's going to be lots of things that happen that require hard conversations.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 他们会说你不信任我，你认为我会拿走你的东西。这很不性感。这很。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and they say you don't trust me like you think I'm going to take your stuff. This is not very sexy. This is

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 好吧，可以说你也不信任我，对吧？因为信任是双向的。所以当你说你不信任我时，你是在说你不相信这段婚姻会持久，或者你不相信，你是在说你不相信如果这段婚姻结束，我们不会彼此公平。对吧？那么你为什么要嫁给一个你认为不会对你公平的人呢？你不是在保护自己免受彼此的伤害。你是在保护自己免受政府制定规则的伤害，以防你的婚姻以死亡以外的方式结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: well arguably you don't trust me equally, right? Because that trust works both ways. So what what what you're saying when you say you don't trust me is you're saying that you don't trust that this marriage is going to last or you don't trust you're saying you don't trust that in the event this marriage ends we won't be fair to each other. Right? So, why would you marry someone who you don't believe that they're going to be fair to you? What you're you're not protecting yourselves against each other. You're protecting yourselves against the government making the rule set in the event that that your marriage ends in something other than death.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你知道，我有一个朋友，有两个人说服我应该签婚前协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You know, I've got a friend um there's two people that convinced me that I should get a prenup.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 其中一个是你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: One of them was you.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 谢谢。嗯，另一个是看着一个朋友经历离婚，他告诉我，实际上，我们有一次去吃饭，看到他脸上的沮丧，因为这个过程不仅毁了他与前妻的关系，因为他们经历了七年的猛烈攻击，两组律师都在互相争斗。他说他支付了律师费，她的律师费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Thanks. Um, and then the other was watching a friend go through divorce and he said to me actually when we we went for dinner one time that it was it was it was looking at his face and seeing the like depression in his face from the process because not only had it ruined his relationship with his ex-wife because they've gone through this onslaught for seven years where two sets of lawyers were fighting either side. He said that he had paid for the lawyer her lawyers

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 他必须这样做，我当时不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: which he has to do which I I wasn't

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。有一个推定，即收入较高的一方应该负责收入较低配偶的合理法律费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. There's a presumption that the higher earning individual should be responsible for the legal reasonable legal fees of the the less uh earning spouse.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 他说她的律师现在拥有了一座摩天大楼，而当这场离婚开始时，他还在一个小小的办公室里。现在他拥有了一座巨大的建筑，因为他不得不为她的律师花费数千万。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: He said her lawyer has now got like a skyscraper whereas when this divorce started he was in a small little office. Now he's got like some massive building because he's had to spend tens of millions on her lawyers.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 而且。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的，我有一些客户支付了数百万。他还说了另一件事，那就是他有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: yeah, I've had clients who paid millions. The other thing he said was that he has

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 她的律师正试图夸大他的资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: her lawyer is trying to inflate his assets

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 告诉法官他的生意价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: to tell the judge that his business is worth

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 数十亿美元，现在我知道为什么这场离婚拖了这么久了。他们有相互对立的专家。所以，律师们没有雇佣中立专家来评估他的商业利益，而是选择雇佣各自的党派专家。这种情况有时会发生。当你雇佣一个党派专家时，你当然会，你知道，如果你代表想要一半财产的一方，你会找到一个人。你可以，香烟公司有医生愿意作证说香烟对你有益。如果你付足够的钱，你可以找到一个专家来说几乎任何事情。所以你找到可信的专家，他们会过高地评估企业价值，然后因为价值是投机性的，然后另一方有动机雇佣专家，他们会故意贬低企业价值，然后你有两个机会。一是你可以玩弄数据集，你可以质疑数据集，然后另一个是你可以质疑从数据集得出的结论。所以你可以说你使用了错误的数据，所以你得出了错误的结论。或者你可以说你使用了正确的数据，但你得出了错误的结论，或者两者兼而有之。这就是我每天在法庭上做的事情，就是试图设计这些观感，或者阻止这些观感被朝那个方向设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: billions of dollars when now I know why this divorce is taking so long. They have dueling experts. So instead of of the two lawyers hiring neutral a neutral expert to value his business interests, what they've elected to do instead is to hire individual partisan experts. And that happens sometimes. And when you hire an individual partisan expert, of course you're going to, you know, if you represent the party who wants half of this thing, you're going to find someone. You can, the cigarette companies had doctors who were willing to testify that cigarettes are good for you. Like you can find an expert to say almost anything if you pay them enough. So you find credible experts that will overly value the business and then because value is speculative and then the other side has an incentive to hire experts who will deliberately diminish the value of the business and then you have two opportunities. One is you can play with the data set and you can impeach the data set and then the other is you can impeach the conclusion that came from the data set. So you can say you used the wrong data and that's how you got to the wrong conclusion. Or you can say you use the right data but you came to the wrong conclusion or some combination of both. Like this is the I get to do all day in a courtroom is to like try to engineer those optics or prevent those optics from being engineered in that direction.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 假设我现在正在和我的伴侣离婚。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And say that I was going through a divorce now with my partner. Mhm.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我的妻子会，她的律师理论上会试图说这个播客价值十亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: My wife would well her lawyer would theoretically be trying to say that this podcast is worth a billion dollars

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 因为那样理论上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: because then theoretically

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 她有权获得更大的百分比。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: she's entitled to a larger percentage. Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 她可能有权获得五亿美元。如果法官认为这个播客价值十亿，我需要找到一种方法支付她五亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: She might be entitled to 500 million. And if the judge believes that this podcast is worth a billion, I need to find a way to pay her 500 million.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 即使我没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Even if I don't have it,

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 它可以分期支付。这被称为分配裁决。它可以分很长一段时间支付。那是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: it can be paid over time. It's what's called a distributive award. It can be paid over an extended period of time. That's

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我的律师会试图争辩说这不值钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and my lawyer is going to be trying to argue that this is worth nothing.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 一文不值。这绝对毫不费力。它一文不值。你应该有负面或有条件折扣，关键人物折扣。这是缺乏市场性折扣。是的，这就是我整天做的事情。这就是我的工作。你看，你知道你为什么需要婚前协议，因为天哪，愿你们俩都不要发生那种事。你会付钱给我。我每小时收一千美元，帮助人们驾驭那种混乱，或者制造那种混乱作为对付一个人的武器，或者只是威胁制造那种混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Nothing. It's absolutely effortless. It's worth nothing. You should have negative contingency discounts, a key man discount. It's a lack of discount for marketability. There's Yeah, this is all I do all day. This is the gig. And and see, you know why you want a prenup is cuz God forbid for both of you that that happens. Like you're you're going to pay me. I get a thousand dollars an hour to help people navigate that kind of chaos or to create that kind of chaos as a weapon against a person or to just threaten that kind of chaos.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 这不意味着你的利益在于扩大冲突，拖延冲突，延长冲突吗？顺便说一句，我靠操纵人们的情绪状态谋生。我之前说过。你不认为我可以用我的能力作恶，让我的客户感到恐惧和担忧，认为有力量正在联合起来对付他吗？顺便说一句，这就是好律师如何赢得好名声的原因，因为有时我们有一个客户，我们可能赚数百万美元，但我们以大约一万美元的费用解决了这个案子。就像我现在有一个案子，我的对方律师，我认为他是**纽约市**唯一比我更好的律师。他对我来说就像一个偶像，因为他是一个非常优秀的庭审律师，他是这个案子中我的对手，这不是我们第一次交手，我们俩在法庭上就像两只霸王龙在打架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Doesn't that mean it's your in your interest to stretch to amplify conflict and stretch it out and protract it? And by the way, I manipulate people's emotional state for a living. I said that earlier. You don't think I could use my powers for evil to get my client terrified and worried that forces are aligning against him? By the way, that's how good lawyers get their reputation as being good lawyers because sometimes we have a client where we could potentially make millions of dollars and we settle the case within like $10,000 worth of fee. Like I have a case right now where my opposing council is I I would consider the only lawyer in New York City better than me. like he's sort of like an idol to me in the sense that he's such a good trial lawyer and he's my adversary on this case and it's not the first case we've had against each other and we are like when the two of us go in a courtroom it's like T-Rexes fighting

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我们会在两通电话内解决这个案子，因为我们俩都不是那种会不必要地扩大冲突的人。我们之所以有声誉，就是因为我们不那样做。我们中最优秀的人，就是这样赢得声誉的。那些扩大冲突的人，消息会传出去。消息会传出去，这是一个你靠声誉生存和死亡的行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: we're going to settle this case in like two phone calls because we both are just not the kind of people that are going to unnecessarily amplify conflict. We we we have our reputation because we don't do that. Like the best of us, that's how you earn the reputation. The people that do that amplifying of conflict, word gets out. Word gets out and that's this is a business where you live and die by your reputation.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以，我这里有一些**M&M's**巧克力豆之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So, I have some M&M's here or something.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你喜欢**M&M's**。嗯，给我解释一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You love M&M's. Um, explain to me.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以，这实际上很好地说明了婚前协议应该是什么。好吧。婚前协议就是，婚前协议不是对我们分手可能性的公投。婚前协议不是对我们彼此信任程度的评论。婚前协议不是，你知道，一个让你去坑害你即将与之共度一生的人的机会。好吧？婚前协议是一套规则。它创建了分层。好吧？所以，你有一些东西。她有一些东西。现在，你什么都不欠她。她什么都不欠你。你的就是你的。她的就是她的。你处于所有权体系中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So, this is actually a great illustration of what a prenup should be. Okay. All a prenup is, a prenup is not a referendum on the likelihood of us breaking up. A prenup is not a commentary on how much we trust each other. A prenup is not um, you know, an opportunity to screw the person you're about to join lives with. Okay? A prenup is a rule set. It's creating tranches. Okay? So, you have some things. She has some things. Right now, you don't owe her anything. She doesn't owe you anything. Yours is yours. Hers is hers. You're in the title system.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我们能谈谈如果我们只是约会的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Can we talk about if we're just dating?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 所以，如果我们正在约会，我听说有些法律规定，如果你和某人约会足够长时间，最终他们基本上可以声称拥有你的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, if we're dating, I heard that there's some laws where if you date someone long enough, eventually they can basically argue that they own your stuff.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。那被称为以前的普通法婚姻，或者它让你对我们以前称之为“伴侣赡养费”的东西负责，那就像是给朋友的赡养费。好吧。嗯，大多数司法管辖区不再承认这一点。它不存在了。这很大程度上是婚姻平等缺失的结果。所以一旦婚姻平等实现，一旦同性恋个体可以结婚，法院系统基本上就开始说不再存在准婚姻关系了。如果你结婚了，你就是结婚了。如果你没有，你就没有。所以，如果你决定同居而没有婚姻，那么你就不再有准婚姻关系了。现在婚姻平等是全国性的法律，所有想结婚的人都被允许结婚。你不能说：“好吧，我们有点像结婚了，但我们没有结婚。”你要么结婚了，要么没有结婚。这就是两个分层。所以，那种情况，你处于所有权体系中。你的就是你的，她的就是她的。除了自愿的“我们”之外，没有“我们”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. So that's called what used to be called common law marriage or it makes you responsible for what we used to call palimony which is like alimony for a friend palimony. Okay. Um most jurisdictions no longer honor that. It doesn't exist. It was largely a function of the absence of marriage equality. So once marriage equality occurred, once gay and lesbian individuals could marry, the court system essentially started saying there's no such thing as a quasi marital relationship anymore. If you are married, you're married. If you're not, you're not. So, if you decide to live together and you don't have a marriage, then you can't have a quasi marital relationship anymore. Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and everyone who wants to get married is allowed to get married. You can't say, "Well, we were kind of like married, but we weren't married." Like, you're either married or you're not married. Those are the two tranches. So, that situation, you're in the title system. Yours is yours, hers is hers. There is no wei except for the voluntary wei.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 好的。那么现在回到**M&M's**巧克力豆和婚前协议的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay. So now using coming back to this example of these M&Ms and prenups.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 那么婚姻简单来说就是这样。有你，有我，这是我们。这是我们的桶。好吧？当我们结婚时，我们会把你拿走。我没有全部放进去。看到我没有全部放进去吗？好吧，我把这个分开。这叫做独立财产。好吧，在**加利福尼亚州**，这叫做共同财产。这是我在婚姻期间获得的任何东西。好吧，这是独立财产。如果我把它分开，它就保持分开。好吧，它保持分开。记住这一点。这是她。好吧。所以，她也把她的一些东西放进去了。可能不完全一样，但非常接近。顺便说一句，我们刚刚结婚。很容易看出哪个是哪个，对吧？好吧。所以，这就是任何婚姻，无论有没有婚前协议。好吧？婚姻就是这样。有你，有我，有我们。我们结合在一起。顺便说一句，这不仅仅适用于资产和负债。这就像我们东西的性质，我们的家具，我们带入关系中的东西。你甚至可以说这就像我们看电视的内容，对吧？是你，我，我们，然后我们把两者结合起来。好吧。现在，你和我都明白，这实际上就是它开始的样子。它永远不会保持整洁，对吧？它总是开始混在一起。在法律上，我们称之为混同。好吧。现在，婚前协议的有趣之处在于。这仍然保持简单，因为你放进这个桶里的任何东西都是婚姻财产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So here's what marriage is simply put. There's you, there's me, this is we. This is the bucket of we. Okay? When we get married, we're going to take you. I didn't put it all. See how I didn't put it all? Okay, I'm keeping this separate. That's called separate property. Okay, in **California**, this is called community property. This is anything I acquire during the marriage. Okay, this is separate property. If I keep it separate, it stays separate. Okay, it stays separate. Keep that thought. This is her. Okay. So, she's put some of hers in there, too. May not be exactly the same, but it's pretty close to it. And by the way, we just got married. It's pretty obvious to see which one's which, right? Okay. So, so this is any marriage really, with or without a prenup. Okay? This is what marriage looks like. There's you and there's me and there's we. We're combining. And by the way, this isn't just for assets and liabilities. This is like the nature of our stuff, our furniture, the things we bring to the relationship. You could even argue it's like what we watch on TV, right? It's you, me, we, and we combine the two. Okay. Now, you and I both know this is actually what it starts to look like. It never stays just neat, does it? It always starts to get kind of mixed up together. In the law, we call that co-mingling. Okay. Now, here's what's interesting with a prenup. This stays this simple because anything you put in this bucket is marital.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 那可能是我为房子买的东西。那可能是一个联名银行账户。它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And that could be stuff I bought for the house. It could be a joint bank account. It

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 可能是任何东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: could be anything.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 好的？当我们有婚前协议时，我们所做的就是你的、我的、我们的，我们正在定义它。所以也许我希望你感觉到我非常投入这段关系。所以我再投入一些。嘿，宝贝，我刚拿到工作奖金。我把它投入到“我们”中。我这边留一点。我那边留一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Okay? All we're doing when we have a prenup is yours, mine, ours, and we're defining that. So maybe I want you to feel I'm very invested in this relationship. So I throw some more in. Hey babe, I just got a bonus at work. I'm throwing it into the wei. I'm keeping a little over here. I'm keeping a little over here.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 等等，你能在结婚后这样做吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wait, can you do that after the marriage?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 有婚前协议的话？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: With a prenup?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以，你可以增加婚前协议的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So, you can add to a prenup.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 有了婚前协议，你所说的是，如果它在我的名下，那就是我的。资产或负债。如果它在你的名下，那就是你的。资产或负债。如果它在我们的联名下，我们就50/50分割，或者按照我们书面约定的方式。但我们创建了三个独立的桶。你的，我的，和我们的。好吧？你知道在**加利福尼亚州**七年后，或者在**纽约州**，如果你以任何方式混同资产，会发生什么吗？这仅仅是你名下的东西。这仅仅是她名下的东西。你结婚前拥有的东西。这是你和我结婚前的你和我。现在都是共同财产了。所有的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: With a prenup, what you're saying is if it's in my name, it's mine. Asset or liability. If it's in your name, it's yours. Asset or liability. If it's in our joint names, we divide it 50/50 or how we agree in writing. But we create three separate buckets. Yours, mine, and ours. Okay? Do you know what happens in the state of **California** after seven years or in the state of **New York** if you co-mingle assets in any way? This is solely things in your name. This is solely things in her name. Things you owned before marriage. This is the you and the me before you got married. It's community property now. All of it.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 所有的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Everything.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所有的一切。每一分钱。你没有婚前协议。里面的一切，这里面的一切都将受到分割。这里面的一切都将受到识别、估价和分割。想想看，想想看，整理这些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: All of it. Every bit of it. You didn't have a prenup. Everything that's in it, everything in here is is subject to division. Everything that's in here is subject to identification, valuation, and division. And think about think about sorting that out.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 而且回到我朋友的例子，这些资产的一些价值是有争议的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And also going back to my friend, some of the value of these assets is up for debate.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 当然。当然。不仅是价值，因为你看，其中一些已经破裂了，一些没有。它们是在这个过程中破裂的，还是之前就破裂了？是她弄坏的，还是你弄坏的？哪些比其他更有价值？这些一开始都一样吗？没关系。都在里面了。顺便说一句，拿出婚姻财产，拿出你的财产。现在，那会花你多长时间？那是不可能做到的。一旦你进入共同财产体系，一旦你把某些东西放进“我们”这个类别，如果你没有婚前协议就结婚，你可能会无意中陷入这个体系，顺便说一句，我靠帮助人们解决这个问题过着非常舒适的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Sure. Sure. Not only is the value because look, some of these are cracked and some of them aren't. And did they crack in this process or were they cracked before? Did she crack them or did you crack them? And which ones are worth more than the others? And were these the same at the be? It doesn't matter. It's all in. And by the way, take take out the marital take out your property. Now, how long is that going to take you? It's impossible to do that. Once you're in the community property system, once you've put something into the Wii category, if you get married without a prenup, you can unintentionally buy into this into this system, which by the way, I make a very comfortable living helping people sort this out.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 然而，你所要做的就是就你的、我的、我们的规则集达成一致，然后这是有意的。现在，我明白为什么这对某些人来说很可怕，因为你必须进行一场对话，关于“好吧，我们是把它放在联名下吗？”或者“好吧，你拿到了那笔奖金。你是把它放在我的账户里，还是你的账户里，或者一些在你的账户里，一些在我的账户里，或者一些在这里？”但难道不是最好对这方面保持一定程度的控制吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Whereas whereas all you had to do was agree on the rule set of yours, mine, ours, and then this is intentional. Now, I understand why that's scary for some people because you have to have a conversation about, well, are we putting that in joint names? Or, well, you got that bonus. Are you putting it in my account or your account or some in your account and some in my account or some in this? But isn't it better to keep some level of control over this?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 如果我是一个受金钱驱动的人，我娶了你，而你是一个亿万富翁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: If I was a financially motivated individual and I was marrying say you and you were a billionaire,

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我的意思是，避免这份婚前协议非常符合我的利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I mean it's very much in my interest to avoid this prenup.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 也许吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Maybe.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 因为那样，你知道，七年后一切都会变成“我们”的。所以我只需要和你在一起七年，然后我就可以离开，我将赚到五亿美元。你见过这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Because then, you know, it's all going to become we in seven years time. So I've just got to be with you for seven years and then I can bounce out of this and I'm going to make half half a billion dollars. Have you ever seen that?

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 当然。你见过吗？但我也要告诉你。换个角度想一下。我们结婚了六年半。一切进展顺利。我们到了六年半的关口。你是一个亿万富翁。你可能不傻，对吧？你会打这个赌吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Of course. Have you ever seen but here's also what I will say to you. Flip that story for a second. So we're married for 6 and 1/2 years. It's going pretty well. We're at the 6 and 1/2 year mark. You're you're a billionaire. You're probably not stupid, right? Are you going to take that bet?

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 是七年是那个时刻吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Is it seven years is the moment

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 七年是那个时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: 7 years is the moment

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 当一切都变成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: when it all becomes

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 共同财产。是的。所以你发现一些非常成功的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: community property. Yeah. So do you find some very successful people

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 他们在六年半的时候离婚率飙升，为什么？原因和为什么我告诉人们不要在婚前协议中设置所谓的“日落条款”是一样的，因为人们都天真地以为他们会说：“好吧，我们会签婚前协议，但十年后它就会失效，十年后它就会像**《碟中谍》**一样自毁。”而这只会让人们在九年半的时候问一些非常令人不适的问题，因为七年，七年就像蜜月期结束了。你可能有一个或两个孩子，然后突然你会想：“好吧，我是否希望我结婚前拥有的一切的一半现在都受到分割？事情进展得那么顺利吗？我想打这个赌吗？”你看，我们生活在现实中。当你嫁给一个人时，你是在把你的命运嫁给他们，你正在对一个你看不见的未来做出决定。它还没有发生。如果七年是我们的资产混同到共同财产的程度，以至于我们必须在关系中分割资产的时刻，你见过有人在七年零一天后申请离婚，因为他们要得到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: they spike the divorce rate at six years six and a half years because why? It's the same reason why I tell people don't put don't put what we call you know sunset clauses in a prenup because people people all have the bright idea that they're going to oh well we'll do a prenup but after 10 years it'll go away after 10 years you know it'll self-destruct like in **Mission Impossible**. And all that does is makes people ask really icky questions at the nine and a half year mark where they have to start going because seven years seven years it's like the honeymoon's over. Maybe you got a kid or two and all of a sudden you go, "Okay, do I want fully one half of everything I owned prior to the marriage to now be subject to division? Is it going that good? Do I want to take this bet?" Like look, we live in reality. What you're doing when you marry someone is you're marrying your destiny to them and you're making decisions about a future that you can't see. It hasn't happened yet. If seven years is the moment when our assets become co-mingled to the point that community property where we have to kind of split our assets in a relationship, have you ever seen someone get to like seven years in one day and then file for divorce because they're going to get

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的，我见过有人等到那一刻。还有其他适用的公式。就像我现在有很多客户来找我咨询，他们说：“是的，我不会再等六个月才提交申请，因为六个月后我们就满20年了。”当我们达到那个点时，根据公式，赡养费会上升到另一个水平。就像这样。当政府为你做决定时，他们会设定数字。就像我们现在附近有一条高速公路。每小时55英里是可接受的合法行驶速度。56英里你就犯了罪。76英里你就犯了不同级别的罪。106英里你就犯了更高级别的重罪。对吧？56和55差别很大吗？不。我们必须选择一个数字。所以我们选择了那个数字。那么你相信政府会选择这个数字吗？这是你在考虑婚前协议时唯一需要问的问题，那就是我是否如此信任政府，以至于我会让他们来选择数字？就我个人而言，我不信任。就我个人而言，如果我喜欢一个人到如此程度，以至于我决定从80亿个选项中选择他们，我想我应该对那个人有足够的信心，能够与我们之间制定一套规则，而且，顺便说一句，不是一套复杂的规则。如果它在我的名下，那就是我的。如果它在你的名下，那就是你的。如果它在我们的名下，那就是我们的。然后你可以进行所有你想进行的对话，关于你为什么不把东西放在联名下，或者你为什么把东西放在联名下，以及我需要什么才能感到安全，因为是这样。如果你是亿万富翁，或者你嫁给了亿万富翁，你们都想感受到，记住，我们回到你想要感受什么？你想要感受什么？那是关键问题。你想要感受什么？你们都想感到安全。这公平吗？我代理过很多亲密伴侣虐待和家庭暴力的受害者，以及强制控制的受害者，我可以告诉你，如果你不感到安全，你就无法感受到爱。有很多方式可以让一个人感到不安全，身体上、情感上、经济上。有很多方式可以让人感到，我希望你希望让你的未婚妻感到安全。我希望她希望让你感到安全。所以，你让她感到安全的方式之一。顺便说一句，你无法保护她免受世界上所有事情的伤害。你知道的，对吧？就像有人扔了核弹，你什么也做不了来帮助她。好吧？有很多事情发生，你无法保护她免受伤害，但你会尽力而为，那很棒。好吧。顺便说一句，她希望你感到安全。她希望你感到安全，不被利用，并因你本来的样子而被爱。对吧？我完全相信她爱你不仅仅是为了钱。世界上有很多有钱人。所以，她爱你是因为你独特的组合。其中一个因素可能是你是一个在事业上非常成功的男人。那让她感到安全。那让她感到安心。那让她觉得她可以和你有一个光明美好的未来。她可以把精力集中在其他事情上，而不是寻找。那太好了。这太好了，伙计。我们都很开心。我们在做这件事。那么，把这个对话作为一个持续的对话，关于我们需要什么才能感到安全，有什么问题呢？因为如果你处于那种动态中，她很漂亮，他很富有，如果她对他说：“嘿，如果我们分手了，我需要一些东西。我并没有真正关注财务，而你比我拥有多得多。”你告诉我一个男人不会说：“是的，这很合理。”顺便说一句，什么时候进行那次对话？当你和对方在恋爱初期疯狂相爱时，当你单膝跪地在餐厅前向对方求婚时。你不能在分手时进行。那是进行那次对话最糟糕的时候。在你们第一次拥有那种乐观和彼此连接的丰富情感时进行。然后，顺便说一句，他感到不安全的是什么？他感到不安全的是，他说：“你看，我愿意为这段关系在财务上做出贡献。显然，我已经证明了这一点。我给你买了**铂金包**。我给你买了车。我支付你的账单。我正在签约娶你，给你一个美好、幸福的生活。”你是否有权获得我曾经拥有的一切的100%或50%？我现在拥有的比你多得多。那看起来太离谱了。你是在说我结婚后赚到的一切都应该分割吗？这就是婚前协议的伟大之处。你可以在那种情况下制定任何你想要的规则。所以我相信，坦诚地谈论这些事情具有真正的价值。你看，这只是**M&M's**。归根结底，这只是钱。顺便说一句，这并没有比你口袋里拿着的那些我们赋予了价值的纸片有更多的实际价值。如果非要说有什么，那就是这个味道很好。你想嚼多少钱就嚼多少钱。那没用。我确实和我的伴侣进行了这次对话，我们讨论了它，她非常，她非常支持婚前协议，因为她也想要一份，她想保护她的资产和她建立的事业，以及所有这些事情，这很有用，但我也承认，你知道，我赚更多的钱，所以如果将来我们有一个大家庭，我们有四五个孩子。

**James Sexton**: What you're doing when you marry someone is you're marrying your destiny to them and you're making decisions about a future that you can't see. It hasn't happened yet. If seven years is the moment when our assets become co-mingled to the point that community property where we have to kind of split our assets in a relationship, have you ever seen someone get to like seven years in one day and then file for divorce because they're going to get Yeah, I've had people who wait until the exact moment. Like there's other there's other formulas that are applicable. Like I I have plenty of people right now that have come to me for a consultation and they're like, "Yeah, I'm not going to file for another 6 months because we'll hit 20 years in 6 months." And when we hit that, it kicks up to another level of alimony in terms of the formulas. Like here's the thing. When the government makes decisions for you, they set numbers. Like there's a highway near where we are right now. It's 55 miles an hour is an acceptable legal speed to drive on that. 56 and you're committing a crime. 76 and you're committing a different level of crime. 106 and you're committing a higher level felony crime. Right? Is 56 and 55 that much different? No. We had to pick a number. So, we picked that number. So, do you trust the government to pick the number? That's the only question to ask when you're thinking about a prenup is, do I trust the government so much that I'm going to let them pick the number? Personally, I don't. Personally, if I like someone so much that I've decided I'm going to choose them out of 8 billion other options, I would think I have enough faith in that person to come up with a rule set between us that we and BY THE WAY, NOT A COMPLICATED rule set. If it's in my name, it's mine. If it's in your name, it's yours. If it's in our name, it's ours. Then you can have all the conversations you want about why aren't you putting things in joint names or why are you putting things in joint names and here's what I need to feel safe because here's the thing. If you're the billionaire or you're the person marrying the billionaire you both want to feel remember we're going back to what is it you want to feel? What is it you want to feel? That's the key question. You what do you want to feel? You both want to feel safe. Isn't that fair? I've represented a lot of victims of intimate partner abuse and domestic violence and course of control and I can tell you you can't feel loved if you don't feel safe. And there's lots of ways for a person to feel unsafe physically, emotionally, financially. There's lots of ways to make someone I hope you want to make your fiance feel safe. And I hope she wants to make you feel safe. So, one of the ways that you make her feel safe. By the way, you can't protect her from everything in the world. You know that, right? Like somebody drops a nuke, there's nothing you're going to be able to do to help her with that. Okay? There's lots of things that can happen that you can't keep her safe from, but you're going to do your darnest, and that's great. Okay. And by the way, like she wants you to feel safe. She wants you to feel safe and not taken advantage of and loved for who you are. Right? I I have every confidence she does not love you just for money. There's lots of people with money in the world. So, she loves the unique combination of things that are you. One factor of which may be that you're a very successful man professionally. And that makes her feel safe. And that makes her feel secure. And it makes her feel like she can really have a future with you that's a bright and lovely one. And she can focus her energies on things other than find. That's great. This is great, man. We're both happy. We're doing the thing. So, what is wrong with just keeping this conversation an ongoing conversation about what is it we need to feel safe? Cuz if you are in that dynamic where she's gorgeous and he's rich, if she says to him, "Hey, if we split up, I'm going to like need some things. Like, I I'm not really focusing on finances and you have so much more than me. You're telling me a guy's not going to say, "Yeah, it makes sense." And by the way, when's the time to have that conversation? WHEN YOU'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH EACH other in the beginning of this thing, when you're on your knee in front of the restaurant, you know, proposing to the person. You don't have it when you're breaking up. That's the worst time to have that conversation. Have it when you're first having that abundance of optimism and connection to each other. And then and then, by the way, what does he feel unsafe? He feels unsafe that he's saying, "Look, I'm willing to contribute financially to this relationship. Clearly, I've proven that. I bought you a **Birkin bag**. I bought you a car. I pay for your bills. I'm signing on to marry you and to give you a wonderful, beautiful life." Are you entitled to 100% or 50% of everything I've ever owned? I have so much more than you right now. Like, that seems wildly. Do you Are you saying that everything I earn from the date of marriage on we should split? Like, that's what's great about a prenup. You can make whatever rules you want to in that situation. So I I believe there is genuine value in having honest conversations about these things. Look, I it's just **M&M's**. It's just money the end of the day. And by the way, this has no more real value than the pieces of paper you're holding in your pocket that we've attributed value to. If anything, this tastes good. Chew on money all you want. It won't help. I did have this conversation with my partner and we we talked about it and she was very um she was very supportive of a prenup because she also wants one and she wants to protect her assets and the business that she's built and all those kinds of things which was useful but also I acknowledged you know that I'm I earn more money so in the event that we have a big family in the future we have four five kids

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我认为我需要贡献更多，以确保她将来一切安好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: you I think I need to contribute more to make sure that she's fine in the event

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 当然不是，但你看，这就是重点，你是一个理性的人，如果她的回应是：“好吧，你知道，我们可能想要一个家庭，你知道，如果我们真的有了，你比我多得多，尽管我签署了保护你的资产，但你知道，我真正专注于的追求并不是纯粹的财务，它们更多是为了世界的福祉，或者为了个人的福祉，我是一个帮助者，我是一个想要让世界变得更美好的人。”你知道，我对她有一些了解，我知道这些是她的目标，她的目标不是成为一切的CEO，她的目标是帮助世界，帮助人们。那很美。那可能是你如此爱她的原因之一。所以，你们俩现在不应该进行这样的对话吗？然后说：“好吧，当然。”顺便说一句，如果我们有了孩子，我将需要不同的东西。婚前协议的伟大之处在于你可以制定一份协议，规定：“如果我们没有孩子，就是这样。如果我们有孩子，就是那样。”你可以设置一些对你们双方都有意义的保护措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I'm not of course but but see this is the point you're a reasonable person if your response when she said well you know I we may want to have a family and you know if we do like you have so much more than me and although I'm signing off to protect your assets like you know the pursuits I I am really concentrating my day on are not purely financial they're more for the good of the world or for the good of individuals I'm I'm a helper I'm a person who wants to to to to make the world a better place you know I know a little bit about her that I know that these are these are her goals her goal is not to be I want to be the CEO of everything her goal goals is to help the world and to help people. That's beautiful. That's probably one of the reasons why you love her so much. And so, isn't that a conversation the two of you should have now and say, "Well, of course." And by the way, if we have kids, I'm going to need different things. What's great about a prenup is you can make one that says, "If we don't have kids, it's this. If we have kids, it's this." Like, there's protections you can put in that make sense to both of you.

### 宠物协议

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 宠物呢？我听说过这种宠物协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What about pets? I've heard about this petnup.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 宠物协议？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Petnup? Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 什么是宠物协议？人们真的会这样做吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What's a pet nup? And do people actually

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。是的。宠物协议（**PTNUP**）是我创建的网站**trustedpetnup.com**，它是免费的。100%免费。它是“随你支付”的。所以如果你想支付任何费用，100%都会捐给动物收容所，基本上是501c3动物收容所。但本质上，我们发现现在法律系统中越来越多地发生的是类似监护权案件，但对象是伴侣动物。所以人们养狗，人们养猫，人们养鸟，人们养任何动物组合。我们对我们的宠物投入了深厚的情感。嗯，多年来，法律将宠物视为“动产”。动产是财产，财产本质上就像如果你杀了别人的狗，你欠他们狗的替换价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. Yeah. Pet a **PTNUP** is I actually created the site **trustedpetnup.com** and uh it's free. It's 100% free. It's uh if you it's a pay as you wish. So if you want to to pay anything towards it, 100% of it goes to animal shelters basically to to 501c3 animal shelters. But essentially what we have found is happening more in the legal system right now is the equivalent of custody cases but for companion animals. So people have a dog, people have a cat, people have a bird, people have any combination of animals. We feel deeply emotionally invested in our pets. Um the law for many years looked at pets as what was called cattle. Chatt is property and property is essentially like if you killed someone's dog, you owed them the replacement value of the dog.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 从法律角度来看，你通常会看到什么？是不是他们曾经一起养了一只宠物，但从未真正明确谁拥有这只宠物。他们离婚了。他们都为这只宠物争吵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What do you tend to see from a legal perspective here? Is it that at one point they bought a pet together, they never really clarified who owns the pet. They go through a divorce. They're both arguing over the pet.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 这种情况发生了很多。是的，那是最常见的组合。有时是他们在约会时一起养了一只宠物，其中一人住在自己的公寓里，或者其他地方，狗或猫和他们住在一起，然后他们合并了家庭，现在他们都对这只动物产生了深厚的感情，你知道，他们和这只动物一起度过了5年或10年，现在他们都像对待孩子一样。他们都像对待继子一样，非常相似，就像它不是我的亲生孩子，但你知道，我与它相处了很长时间，并参与了它的照顾，我对它们来说意味着什么。法律上呢？法律上呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: That happened a lot. Yeah, that was the most common permutation. Sometimes it was they got a pet together while they were dating and one of them was living, you know, in their own apartment or whatever and the dog or cat was living with them and then they merged their homes and now they both grow deeply attached to this animal and you know they've spent 5 years or 10 years together with this animal and now they both like a child. They both have this like a stepchild is very similar like it's not my blood child but it's you know someone who I've spent a long time with and been part of their care and I mean something to them. What's the legal? What's what what's the

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 好吧，多年来，宠物一直被视为动产。它们被视为财产。所以，你知道，我记得**纽约县**有一个案例，当事人无法就如何处理狗达成一致，比如谁来养狗。法官说：“好吧，我命令把狗卖掉，然后分割收益。”当然，人们出去后就明白了，那非常像**所罗门**的判决。人们出去后就为狗制定了探视时间表。但我们只是说，就像婚前协议中的任何事情一样，提前做好。提前做好。如果你有宠物，就签宠物协议。即使你不结婚，如果你同居或约会，也要签订一份合同，说明：“我们都关心这只动物。我们收养了这只动物，或者我们购买了这只动物，或者我们把这只动物带入了我们的生活。现在，如果我们的关系结束了，规则将是这样。我们将共同做出重要的医疗决定，并听取兽医的意见。如果我们中的任何一方要放弃这只动物供人领养，另一方将有自动领养的权利。如果最终到了需要安乐死的时候，我们双方都有权在告别那只狗的时候在场，或者我们双方都有权共同决定那只动物的骨灰将放在哪里，或者它们将被埋葬在哪里，或者我们双方都有权获得一半的骨灰，或者如果我们要分开，我们将为狗制定探视时间表。”那就是宠物协议。宠物协议是两个人之间的一份合同。你看，就像孩子一样，宠物没有要求这一切。宠物没有要求你们分手。这不是它们的错。我不知道有谁是因为狗或猫而分手的。我相信有人，但那不是重点。所以，提前制定一套规则是非常非常有用的。我喜欢提前制定规则。我喜欢知道我们正在玩的游戏规则，因为我们可以相应地调整我们的行为。嗯，离婚率在统计上是否在增加？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Well, for many many years, pets were considered chatt. They were considered property. So, you know, I I remember a case in **New York County** where the parties could not agree on what to do with the dog, like who would keep the dog. And the judge said, "Okay, I'm ordering the dog to be sold and the proceeds divided." And of course, the people then went outside and figured, it was very **Solomonike**. The people went outside and figured out a visitation schedule for the dog. But what we're just saying is just like anything in a prenup, do this in advance. Just do this in advance. you have a pet, have a petup. Even if you're not getting married, if you're cohabitating or you're dating someone, have a contract that says, "We both care about this animal. We've adopted this animal or we purchased this animal or we brought this animal into our lives. And now, in the event that our relationship ends, here's what the rules will be. We will jointly make important medical decisions and be guided by the veterinarian's, you know, perspective. Um if if either of us ever is going to give up the animal for adoption, the other person will have the automatic right to adopt the animal. If the time eventually comes where there has been a recommendation of euthanasia by we will both be entitled to be there when we say goodbye to that dog or we'll both be entitled to jointly agree on where that animal's ashes will be or where they'll be buried or we'll each be entitled to one half of the ashes or we'll have a visitation schedule for the dog in the event that we separate. That's what a petnup is. A petup is a contract between two people. Look, just like kids, pets didn't ask for this. Pets didn't ask for you guys to break up. It's not their fault. Like, I don't know anybody that ever broke up because of the dog or the cat. I'm sure there's somebody out there, but that's not what it's about. So, it is very, very useful to have in advance a rule set. I like rules in advance. I like to know the rules of the game that we're playing because we can adjust our behavior accordingly. Is um divorce increasing statistically?

</details>

### 离婚率与代际差异

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 所以最新的统计数据显示，离婚率正在缓慢上升。它曾经很低。它曾经下降过。疫情期间它下降了。部分原因是法院系统的可及性。再说一遍，当你查看离婚率时，离婚率是根据提交的婚姻解除证明来计算的，这是法院系统在离婚最终确定时向州提交的最终文件。所以你真正看到的只是那些婚姻彻底失败并有离婚判决的案例。有很多人只是出去买牛奶就再也没回来，或者他们分居后从未最终确定离婚。这些人没有被纳入统计数据。所以，那些默默地在一起痛苦生活，或者住在不同地方，然后搬出去但从未最终确定离婚的人，这些统计数据都没有包括他们。这些只是那些真正以离婚告终，并且离婚已在州政府注册的人。但离婚率下降了，然后当法院系统在疫情后重新开放时，离婚申请率飙升，现在又在稳步上升。有趣的是，结婚率正在下降，人们结婚的平均年龄正在上升。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: So it's the most recent statistic is the divorce rate is slowly going up. It was low. It had it had gone down. It went down during the pandemic. Part of that was a function of access to the court system. When again when you're looking at the divorce rate, the divorce rate is calculated based on the filing of what's called certificate of dissolution of marriage, which is the final document that's filed with the state by the court system when a divorce has been finalized. So all you're really seeing there is what marriage is catastrophically failed and and there was a judgment of divorce center. There are many people that just go out for milk and never come back or they physically separate and then they never finalize the divorce. They're not factored into that statistic. So, and the people who quietly stay together miserable or live in different places and just move out and never finalize their divorce. That that that statistic doesn't include any of those people. These are just the people that it actually ended in divorce and that divorce was registered with the state. But the divorce rate went down and then it the divorce filing rate spiked when the court systems opened back up post pandemic and now it's steadily going back up again. Now what's interesting is the marriage rate is going down and the average age at which people marry is going up.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我当时在看这里的代际划分，它说年轻夫妇，也就是千禧一代和**Z世代**的离婚率大幅下降。他们结婚较晚，先同居，并且在统计上更具选择性，从而导致更稳定的婚姻。然而，有一种现象叫做“灰色离婚”。50岁以上人群的离婚率，他们称之为“灰色离婚”，自1990年以来翻了一番，65岁以上人群的离婚率翻了三番。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I was looking at the generational divide here and it says younger couples so millennials and **Gen Z** divorce rates have plummeted. They are marrying later, cohabiting first and statistically more selective leading to more stable marriages. However, there is something called the gray divorce. divorce rates for people over 50 um they refer to as gray divorce has doubled since 1990 and tripled for those over 65.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。“灰色离婚”是很多离婚律师现在正在思考和谈论的话题，首先是人们寿命更长了。由于像勃起功能障碍药物这样的东西，人们以不同的方式活得更久了。你知道，一个80岁的人拥有活跃的性生活，在过去20年药物出现之前，这种情况并不常见。所以，一个70岁或80岁的人的生活质量、外貌和健康状况发生了很大的变化。所以，你知道，随着激素替代疗法，随着所有不同的药物，人们在老年时期过着比以前更性化、更浪漫的生活，这常常导致人们说：“你知道吗，我还有十年时间。我不会再待在这段不幸福的关系中，我要分手。”顺便说一句，我实际上不认为你刚才谈到的这两个统计数据是无关的。我认为千禧一代，他们还没有结婚那么久。婚姻彻底失败的问题，就像我以前说过，人们离婚的方式和他们破产的方式一样，非常缓慢，然后突然之间就全部发生了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah. Gray divorce is a uh something that a lot of divorce lawyers are thinking and talking a lot about right now which is that first of all people are living much longer. People are living in a different way much longer thanks to things like erectile dysfunction medication. like you know an 80year-old having you know a active sex life is not something that really existed so often prior to the pharmaceutical advent of erectile dysfunction drugs which really only occurred in the last 20 years. So there's a big change in in what a 70year-old or 80year-old's quality of life is and what they look like and what their health is like. So, you know, with with uh hormone replacement therapy, with you know, all the different medications that are out there, people are living more uh sexually uh you know, and romantically charged lives in their elder years than they used to, which often leads people to say, you know what, I've got 10 more years. I'm not going to stay in this unhappy relationship and I'm going to split up. I actually don't think, by the way, that those two statistics that you just talked about are unrelated. I think millennials they they haven't been married for that long yet. Like the question of catastrophic failure of a marriage like I I've said it before that people get divorced the same way they go bankrupt very slowly and then all at once.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 我在研究中发现的两个原因，表面上很不明显。其中一个是，这一代（婴儿潮一代和**Z世代**）的女性比前几代人更有可能拥有自己的事业和退休储蓄。这意味着她们有能力离开不幸福的婚姻。当我与更年期专家等交谈时，他们告诉我，他们经常看到这种情况，在人生的这个阶段，女性会，你知道，做出离开的决定。另一个原因是离婚的耻辱感降低了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What two of the reasons given in the research I did as well were quite quite unobvious on the surface. One of them is that women in this generation boomers and **Gen Z** are more likely to have their own careers and retirement savings than previous generations. Meaning they can afford to leave unhappy marriages. And when I've spoken with menopause experts and so on, they they've told me they see this often that in this season of life, women will, you know, make a decision to to leave. And the other one is the reduced stigma about divorce.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: Yeah.

</details>

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 所以离婚不再被视为道德上的失败，这使得在晚年分手在社会上更容易被接受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So divorce is no longer seen as a moral failure, making it socially easier to split later in life.

</details>

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我相信这是真的。我认为我们确实改变了我们对待离婚的方式。我们不再在社会上将其视为一场灾难性的失败。我认为我们常常将其视为一个章节的结束和新篇章的开始。我不认为那不好。我认为消除离婚的污名，并看到，好吧，有时当关系不再对双方都有效，并且他们已经尽力尝试让它奏效，他们决定“从此幸福快乐”意味着“从此各自幸福快乐”时，对人们来说会更好。我不认为那一定是坏事。同样，你也可以争辩说，千禧一代（再说一遍，只有时间会证明）更善于维持婚姻的原因之一是，他们带着更现实的期望进入婚姻。他们不会期望这个人会是他们的一切。他们看待它时会说：“是的，作为一个人类，我正在和一个人类结婚。我还没有完全弄清楚我自己。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Sexton**: I believe that that's true. I think that we've definitely changed the manner in which we relate to divorce. We no longer consider it a catastrophic failure socially. I think that we often see it as the ending of a chapter and the beginning of a new one. I don't think that that's bad. I think dstigmatizing divorce and seeing that, okay, sometimes it is better for people when the relationship is no longer working for both of them and they've done the things they've tried to do to make it work and they've decided that happily ever after means happily ever after separately. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Similarly, you could make the argument that one of the reasons millennials, and again, only time will tell, that millennials are better at uh staying married is going to be that they go into it with more realistic expectations. They don't go into it with the expectation that this person's going to be their everything. They they look at it and go, "Yeah, as a human being, I'm marrying another human being. I haven't quite figured myself out."

### 婚姻书籍与危险假设

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你的哪本书更受欢迎？**《如何不搞砸你的婚姻：一位见多识广的离婚律师的直言不讳》**，还是**《如何维系爱情》**？

**James Sexton**: So, **How to Stay in Love** has been out longer. Yeah. So, it's done quite well um over the period of time. It's in its fourth printing right now.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我认为，它是第一本由离婚律师撰写的，直接探讨如何避免离婚的书。它基本上是一本“如何不”的书。所以，我认为那是一个关键概念，就是如何保持人们的连接，以及你能学到什么。你看，如果你想学习如何保持你的车况良好，你会去找新车经销商还是机械师？新车经销商只看到全新的车。他们对如何实际维护一辆车一无所知。机械师擅长这个。我们告诉你可预测的故障点在哪里。所以，我认为这就是这本书受欢迎的原因。我们没有谈论的最重要的事情是什么？关于维系这个非常珍贵、对许多人来说非常难以捉摸的东西，叫做爱？你知道，我最近一直在思考两件事，我作为一名已订婚的男人和朋友对你说。我认为人们在结婚时会做出两个看似矛盾的假设，我希望你不要做这些假设。好吧？我希望这对夫妇中的任何一方都不要做这些假设。

**James Sexton**: I think a it was the first book written by a divorce lawyer to headon take on the topic of how to not get divorced. It was a how not to book basically. So, I think that that was the the key concept was uh keeping people connected and and what you could learn. Look, who are you going to go to if you want to learn how to keep your car in good condition? A new car dealer or a mechanic? Like, a new car dealer only sees brand new cars. They don't know anything about, you know, about how to actually keep one together. Mechanics are good at that. We tell you where the predictable points of failure are. So, I think that was what made the book popular. What's the most important thing we didn't talk about that we should have talked about as it pertains to the subject of holding on to this very precious thing and very elusive thing for many called love? You know, something I've been thinking a lot about lately is two, and I say this to you as an engaged man and as a friend. I think there's two seemingly contradictory assumptions people make when they get married that I hope you're not making. Okay? I hope this couple neither person in this couple is making

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 一个是认为婚姻会改变对方。所以，你知道，**史蒂文**工作那么多，他那么努力，但一旦我们结婚了，他就会多回家，他就会多待在家里，他就会更平静。你知道，她，她，你知道，当我，我正在编造一些东西，但她担心我，当我在外面旅行时，她担心诱惑会困扰我。但一旦我们结婚了，她就会知道我们有一个非常坚实的承诺。她就不会再有那种担忧了。好吧。认为婚姻会改变某人是一个非常危险的假设。很多来到我办公室的人，他们进入婚姻时认为这会改变他们想看到改变的事情。

**James Sexton**: one is thinking that marriage will change the other person. So, you know, Steven works so much and he's so hard charging, but once we get married, he'll come home more and he'll be home more and he'll calm down more. You know, she's uh uh you know, very worried about me when I'm I'm making something up, but she's worried about me when I'm out and on the road and she's worried about temptation bothering me. But once we're married, she'll know we have a really solid commitment. She won't have that worry anymore. Okay. Thinking that marriage is going to change someone is a very dangerous assumption. And a lot of the people that come into my office, they entered marriage thinking this is going to change things that I want to see changed.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 矛盾的第二件事是认为一旦我们结婚，什么都不会改变。

**James Sexton**: The contradictory second thing is thinking once we get married nothing will change.

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 认为“这太可爱了。她太棒了。我爱她所激发的那个我。所以，和她在一起时我太棒了。”而她认为：“他太棒了，我爱他如何让我。”因为，你知道，我们不仅仅爱这个人。我们爱和那个人在一起时的我们。我们爱那个人如何让我们看待自己。那是一件可爱的事情。那是爱最美好的事情之一，对吧？所以假设那永远不会改变，假设婚姻不会以某种方式为我们共同找到的这个美好、温暖的事物筑起一道墙，保护它免受世界上所有其他事物的伤害，并且什么都不会改变，它只会一直美好，这是另一个非常危险的假设。所以即使这看起来像是一个矛盾。

**James Sexton**: thinking, "This is so lovely. She's so wonderful. I love the version of me she brings out. So, I'm so wonderful when I'm with her." And her thinking, "He's so wonderful, and I love who he how he makes me." Because, you know, we don't just love the person. We love the person we are when we're with that person. We love how that person makes us feel about ourselves. That's a lovely thing. It's one of the best things about love, right? So making the assumption that that will never change that nothing about this rel that marrying will somehow build a wall around this beautiful wonderful warm thing that we found together and it'll protect it from all the other things in the world and nothing will change and it'll just stay wonderful is another very dangerous assumption. So even though it seems like a contradiction,

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 我希望事情会改变，我也希望有些事情不会改变。而我能想到的唯一方法，能让这两个矛盾的元素和平共存，而不直接导致我面前的这张桌子，就是不断地谈论它。当事情发生变化时，就谈论它。指出来就好。不要带着评判，不要带着愤怒，不要相信因为某些事情改变了就是坏事。也不要相信改变就一定是好事。只是说：“嘿，还记得这两个人吗？那个人现在有点不同了。这没关系吗？为什么会这样？是好事还是坏事？你怀念他吗？我们能做些什么不同的或更好的事情吗？”就像这两个人彼此发现了价值。他们爱对方，他们爱和对方在一起时的自己。再说一遍，我再说一次。你的婚姻会结束。我保证。我希望它以死亡告终。我希望当它结束时，你会看着她，你会说：“她帮助我成为了最真实的自己，她仍然是我最喜欢的人。”那是你能给予她，以及你们彼此能给予对方，而且我认为你们两个人一起能给予世界的最大礼物，那比所有的**M&M's**都更有价值。

**James Sexton**: I hope that things change and I hope some things don't change. And the only way that I can think of to let those two contradictory elements peacefully coexist in a manner that doesn't lead directly to the desk in front of me is to just keep talking about it. And when things change, just talk about it. Just point it out. Not with judgment, not with anger, not with the belief that because something changed it's bad. And not with the change that change is automatically good. Just saying, "Hey, remember these two people? That guy's a little different now. Is that okay? Why did that happen? Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Do you miss him? Is there something that we could do that's different or better?" Like these two people found value in each other. They they love the other person and they love who they are when they're with the person. And again, I'll I'll say it again. Your marriage will end. I promise. I hope it ends in death. And I hope when it ends that you will look at her and you will say, "She helped me become the most authentic version of myself and she's still my favorite person." That's the greatest gift that you could give to her and that you can give to each other and that I think the two of you together could give to the world and that's worth all the **M&M's**.

**史蒂文·巴特利特**: 你为什么强调“真实性”在这个语境中如此重要？因为你用了那个词，“她帮助我成为了最真实的自己。”为什么这很重要？

**Steven Bartlett**: Why do you point to authenticity as being so important in this context? Because you use that word, she helped me become the most authentic version of myself. Why does that matter?

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 因为这不关乎成为她为你设想的那个你，也不关乎她成为你希望她成为的样子。我认为有时爱，那个人并没有成为我们希望他们成为的样子。我认为有时我们希望他们成为的样子可能并不是他们最真实的样子。你知道，**纪伯伦**在**《先知》**中谈到孩子时说，孩子是活着的箭，你射出箭，是的，你的目标有一定关系，但风也有一定关系，还有许多其他因素也有关系。所以，你知道，上帝爱手稳的弓箭手和笔直的箭。我觉得如果你说。

**James Sexton**: Because it's not about becoming the version of you that she envisions for you. or her becoming who you want her to become. I think that sometimes love the person doesn't become what we wanted them to be. And I think sometimes what we wanted them to be might not be the most authentic version of who they are. You know, **Cahil Gabbron** in **The Prophet** when he's talking about children, he says that children are living arrows and and and that you you fire the arrow and yes, your aim has something to do with it, but the wind has something to do with it and so many other things have something to do with it. And so, you know, God loves the archer with the steady hand and the arrow that's straight. And I feel like if you were to say

**詹姆斯·塞克斯顿**: 这个人成为了我希望他们成为的样子，因为再说一遍，我认为我们在最好的共生关系中的职责是，你非常关心她，甚至超过关心你自己。她也关心你，甚至超过关心她自己。但不是让你成为她希望你成为的男人，也不是让她成为你希望她成为的女人。你希望为她服务，她也希望为你服务。我希望帮助你成为最真实的自己。我能看到你的盲点。你不能。这就是为什么它们是盲点。所以，我将帮助你成为最真实的自己。这就是承诺。那应该是婚姻中的承诺，就是我希望帮助你成为，我将尽我所能帮助你成为最真实的
