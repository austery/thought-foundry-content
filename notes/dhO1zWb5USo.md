### SurgoCap的投资理念与策略

**Nikolai**: 大家好，我是**Norges Bank Investment Management**的首席执行官**Nikolai Tangen**。今天我非常高兴能邀请到**Mala Gaonkar**。我们认识很久了。Mala创立了**SurgoCap Partners**，最初管理着18亿美元的资产，如今已发展到数十亿美元。在此之前，她在**Lone Pine Capital**担任创始合伙人长达23年，那是有史以来最成功的**对冲基金**之一。很高兴您能来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Hi everybody, I'm **Nikolai Tangen**, CEO of **Norges Bank Investment Management**. And today I'm very happy because I have **Mala Gaonkar** with me. We've known each other for quite some time. Mala started **SurgoCap Partners** with $1.8 billion, and today it has grown to $X billion. Before that, she worked for 23 years as a founding partner at **Lone Pine Capital**, which is one of the most successful **hedge funds** ever. Happy to have you here.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 很高兴来到这里，谢谢。请您介绍一下**SurgoCap**及其运作方式。**SurgoCap**致力于实现许多投资公司都在追求的目标：在三到五年的周期内，以低于市场风险的方式跑赢市场。这里的风险指的是资本损失，而非波动性。我们通过识别全球极少数真正卓越的企业来实现这一目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: It's great to be here. Thank you. Tell me about **SurgoCap** and what it does. Yes, **SurgoCap** tries to do what many investment firms do. It tries to beat the market with less risk than the market over a three to five-year cycle. Risk means loss of capital, not volatility. And we try to achieve this by identifying a very small number of truly great businesses in the world.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们的产品实际上就是我们的流程。这是一个非常透明的流程，它关注一些非常具体的因素。这些因素正如您之前提到的，是我在过去23年里与业界一些最优秀的人士，我的前同事们一起投资，从我的许多错误和经验教训中提炼出来的。所以**SurgoCap**就是从这种提炼中诞生的。识别一家卓越企业有许多不同的因素。但在我看来，一家卓越的企业是拥有非常持久的**护城河**（moats）的企业。这种**持久性**正是我们真正的差异化所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: And we, our product is actually our process. A very transparent process that looks at very specific factors. Which are actually, as you mentioned earlier, a distillation of my lessons learned, my many mistakes, and lessons learned from investing with some of the best people in the business, my former colleagues, for 23 years. So **Surgo** was built from this distillation. There are many different factors to identify a great business. But in my opinion, a great business is one that has very long-lasting **moats**. And this **duration** is our real differentiation.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 所以它们很难被竞争，也很难被超越。世界上有多少这样的优秀公司呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So they're hard to compete with. They're hard to outcompete. How many great companies are there in the world?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 正如我所说，数量非常少。我认为并没有那么多。我们实际上专注于四个垂直领域，我认为在这些领域，通过一个非常具体的因素，我们能获得一些优势。所以，回到30年的投资经验。每个企业都是一个**技术企业**，对吗？如果你是一家航空航天公司，或者一家医疗科技企业，或者一家金融数据企业，那么你的核心就是一家技术公司。如果你想大规模、高质量地交付，你就必须成为一家技术企业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: As I said, it's very few. I don't think there are that many. We actually focus on four verticals where I think there's a bit of an edge from a very specific factor. So, coming back to 30 years of investing experience. Every business is a **technology business**, right? So if you're an aerospace company, or a med-tech business, or a financial data business, then you are a technology company in your backbone. If you want to deliver at scale and with quality, you have to be a tech business.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为理解一个企业的**技术栈**（tech stack）是我们投入大量时间的事情，尤其是在非技术企业中。这是第一点。第二点是，旧技术如何在今天以全新的方式带来**颠覆**。例如，如果你看看汽车行业，它雇佣的人数远超科技行业，但它今天正被一项1976年发明的技术所颠覆，那就是**锂离子电池**。这总是让我非常着迷。当我们开始在韩国投资时，我们购买**GPU**是为了让视频游戏看起来更有趣、更吸引人。而现在，快进到今天，同样的**GPU**正在推动**人工智能**（AI）的发展，这是我们时代最大的社会、人口和技术变革之一。对我来说，旧技术以新方式带来颠覆是非常有趣的，我们甚至在非技术企业中寻找这样的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: And I think understanding the **tech stack** map of a business is something we spend a lot of time on, especially in non-tech businesses. That's the first point. The second is how old technologies are disrupting in completely new ways today. For example, if you look at the auto industry, which employs far more people than the tech industry, it's being disrupted today by a technology invented in 1976, namely the **lithium-ion battery**. This always fascinates me a lot. When we started investing in Korea, we were buying **GPUs** to make video games more fun and engaging. Now, fast forward to today, those same **GPUs** are driving **AI**, which is one of the biggest social, demographic, and technological shifts of our time. For me, it's very interesting that old technologies are causing disruption in new ways, and we look for such opportunities even in non-tech businesses.

### 团队规模与数据科学的应用

**Nikolai**: 我们稍后再回到那个话题。但是当您成立基金时，您给自己设定了什么样的自我限制？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: And we'll come back to that. But when you set up the fund, what kind of self-imposed constraints did you put on yourself?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。有几种方法可以做到。其中之一是**专注**。所以我们决定，我希望团队保持小规模。有几种方法可以做到。其中之一是专注。所以我们决定，或者说，我希望我们的团队保持小规模。如果我从首席执行官那里得到过一个最一致的建议——其中许多人也曾登上这个播客——无论是运营大公司还是小企业的创始人，核心观点都是：保持团队规模小。这不仅仅关乎资产管理规模（AUM）。是的，将1美元乘以数十亿美元比将数十亿美元乘以数十亿美元更容易。但保持团队小规模，并创造一个协作的、跨国界的思维环境，这对于产生创意想法至关重要，对我来说是最重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes. So there are a few ways to do that. One is **focus**. So we decided, I wanted to keep the team small. There are a few ways to do that. One is focus. So we decided, or rather, I wanted our team to remain small. If I've received one consistent piece of advice from CEOs, and many of them have been on this podcast, whether you're running large companies or founders of small businesses, the main point was this: keep the team size small. It's not just about AUM. Yes, multiplying $1 is easier than multiplying billions of dollars. But keeping the team small and creating a collaborative cross-border thinking environment, which is necessary for generating creative ideas, was most important to me.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 有多小？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: How small?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们有一个投资团队，其中也包括一个**数据科学团队**，我们会定期开会，就像这样围着一张桌子，以便进行一次真正的圆桌讨论。嗯，嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: We have an investment team that also includes a **data science team**, and we meet on a regular basis, around a table like this, so we can have a proper round table discussion. Hmm, hmm.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 就像您可能听说过的，**Jeff Bezos**谈论的是“两张披萨的团队”。但我们更喜欢保持“一张披萨的团队”规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: As you may have heard, **Jeff Bezos** talks about two-pizza box teams. But we prefer to stay at a one-pizza box team size.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 就一个盒子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Just one box.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 所以，我会说，每个人分到的披萨并不多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So, I would say that's not much pizza per person.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 没错。我们保持简单。据说我们挪威人是世界上最爱吃披萨的人。据说我们每人每年吃大约11公斤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Exactly. We keep things simple. We Norwegians are said to be the biggest pizza eaters in the world. It is said that we eat about 11 kg per person.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Really?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes, yes.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 这很有趣。我没想到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: That's quite interesting. I hadn't thought of that.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 但是当您将自己的公司与其他科技投资者进行比较时，您认为有什么不同？我们正在观察技术与非技术业务的结合点，正如我所说，旧技术如何以新方式带来变革。这是一个角度。我们还会查看竞争对手、客户和其他常规检查清单。我想说，第二个重要的教训是关于**偏见**，以及您今天如何利用**数据科学**，这在我们投资生涯初期是无法做到的。鉴于**机器学习**现在变得如此快速和开源，您可以以非常低的成本构建非常强大的第三方数据检查。这包括自动化调查，以及围绕市场和技术采用的不同数据点的自动化跟踪，这在90年代末我们职业生涯初期是无法做到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: But when you look at your company compared to other tech investors, what do you think is the difference? We are seeing where technology is meeting non-technology businesses, and as I said, how old technology is bringing about change in new ways. So that's one angle. We also look at the common checklist of competitive and customer and other checks. I would say the second big lesson is about **bias**, and how you can use **data science** today, as we couldn't at the beginning of our investment careers. Given how fast and open source **machine learning** has become, you can build very robust third-party data checks at very low cost. This includes automated surveys, automated tracking of different data points around markets and tech adoption, which we couldn't do at the beginning of our careers in the late 90s.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您能举个例子吗？现在您可以做些什么以前做不到的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Can you give an example? What can you do now that you couldn't do before?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 具体来说，如果您需要追踪产品采用情况，当我们刚开始时，比如1998年在**Lone Pine**，当我观察早期采用情况时，例如**Adobe**产品向云端转型时，那是一个非常手动的过程。您必须亲自联系客户。调查大多需要通过电话进行。追踪回复率也相当棘手。但现在，对于这些任务，我们实际上可以使用**调查机器人**。我们可以结合使用两者：增强型人工调查员，并进行更深入的调查。我们可以通过**机器学习**以高度自动化的方式追踪更多的**SKU**（库存单位）。我们可以进行**网络抓取**。坦率地说，以前没有这样的规模和范围来观察产品采用情况。无法查明哪些供应商开放了**API**，哪些没有。所以这包括**技术栈映射**、产品采用、客户采用，甚至各种通用消费者采用数据，这些现在在消费领域都得到了相当严格的追踪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So, very specifically, if you need to track product adoption, when we were starting, like in 1998 at **Lone Pine**, when I was looking at early adoptions, like about **Adobe** products when they were transitioning to the cloud, it was a very manual process. You had to go out and contact customers. Surveys mostly had to be done over the phone. Tracking response rates was also quite tricky. But now for these tasks, we can actually use **survey bots**. We can use a combination of both. Augmented human surveyors and also do deeper dives. We can track more **SKUs** in a very automated way with **machine learning**. We can **web scrape**. And frankly, there wasn't such scale and scope before to look at product adoptions. To find out who keeps open **APIs** for suppliers and who doesn't. So this includes **tech stack mapping**, product adoption, customer adoption, even various types of general consumer adoption data, which is now tracked quite strictly in the consumer world.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您认为未来的投资机构会更小吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Do you believe that investment organizations will be smaller in the future?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为它们会更小，或许也应该更小，因为**人类协作**在小规模下效果最好。最有趣的数据和那些经常被忽视的想法往往来自跨行业领域。例如，**AI**如何影响**医疗科技**，或者它如何影响航空航天领域的**材料科学创新**。我认为这些角度远比仅仅将**AI**视为技术中的**AI**更有趣。在您的公司中，**AI**有哪些最大或最令人惊讶的优势？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think they will be smaller, and perhaps they should be smaller, because **human collaboration** works best at a small scale. The most interesting data and those ideas that are often missing come from across industry borders. For example, how **AI** is influencing **med-tech**, or how it's affecting **material science innovation** in aerospace. I think these angles are far more interesting than just seeing **AI** as **AI** in technology. What are some of the biggest or some of the most surprising benefits of **AI** in your companies?

</details>

### AI在医疗科技与芯片领域的颠覆

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为**医疗技术**领域正在发生的事情，可能没有得到应有的广泛理解。我给您举一个非常具体而有趣的例子。如果您看一下**影像领域**，比如**MRI**、**CT扫描**、**PET扫描**等。现在获取这些医学图像的准确性、清晰度和速度在过去几年中以近70%的速度提高，而几年前情况并非如此。对于全球老龄化人口来说，这不仅对治疗性护理，也对预防性护理非常有帮助，并且以这种方式，显然使护理更加经济实惠。所以我认为这是一个围绕影像的巨大领域，并且理解这些旧疾病如何增加，而且，我认为早期预防这些疾病一直是一件大事。第二个大领域是**手术的执行方式**。我认为人们谈论**AI**和**机器人技术**在制造业中的应用。人们有时不理解的是，全球每年进行近3亿次手术，而这些手术现在正受到**机器人手术**的影响，特别是通过像**Intuitive Surgical**这样的公司。所以我认为这是另一个大类别，您可以看到真正的创新正在发生。其中**触觉反馈映射**、软件和围绕手术执行的更优技术的结合，确实导致了更少的错误。医学生的培训更容易，并且总体上为这些治疗性治疗的交付创造了更好的环境。正如您所知，关于控制医疗成本的讨论很多，我希望正确实施**AI**能对此有所帮助。所以，是的，我认为技术如何与非技术业务交叉，以及我们如何利用数据来消除人类决策过程中的偏见，是我们非常关注的理念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think what's happening in **medical technology** is perhaps not as well and widely understood as it should be. So let me give you a very specific and interesting example. If you look at the **imaging space**, like **MRI**, **CT scans**, **PET scans**, etc. The accuracy, clarity, and speed with which these medical images can now be taken has been improving at a rate of almost 70% in the last few years, whereas a few years ago, this was not at all the case. For the aging population worldwide, this has been very helpful not only for therapeutic care but also for preventive care, and in this way, obviously, it makes care more affordable. So I think this is a big area around imaging, and understanding how these old diseases are increasing, and you know, I think preventing these diseases early on has been a big thing. The second big area is **how surgeries are performed**. So I think people talk about **AI** and **robotics** in the manufacturing sector. What people sometimes don't understand is that almost 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide, and these are now being influenced by **robotic surgery**, especially through companies like **Intuitive Surgical**. So I think this is another big category where you're seeing real innovation happening. Where the combination of **haptic feedback mapping**, software, and better technology around performing surgery is really leading to fewer errors. Easier training for medical students, and overall a better environment for how these therapeutic treatments can be delivered. And as you know, there's a big discussion about controlling healthcare costs, and I hope that properly implementing **AI** can help with this. So yes, I think this idea of how technology is intersecting with non-tech businesses, and how we can use data to de-bias the human decision-making process, is something we pay a lot of attention to.

</details>

### 集中投资与去偏见化决策

**Nikolai**: 非常有趣。现在您相信**集中投资**。当您选择某物时，您会迈出相当大的一步，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Very interesting. Now you believe in **concentration**. When you choose something, you take a pretty big step, right?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 那么，您是如何看待集中投资的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So tell me, how do you think about concentration?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我有意专注于这四个垂直领域：**企业数据**（广义上的技术）、**金融服务**、**医疗保健服务**和**工业技术**。因为我觉得这些领域是新兴技术颠覆主题最相关的，并且您可以看到拥有非常持久**护城河**的市场领导者，它们能够带来增量回报，而且考虑到当前的技术趋势，将资本部署到这些增量回报上的路径今天更加清晰。所以我们只专注于这四个领域，我们也考虑**主题性风险敞口**，原因非常直接。首先，我认为这为您提供了进攻的机会。因为在某个时候，由于市场结构的被动性，轻微的异常因素轮动可能会扰乱投资组合。这使我们有机会在这些时期进行进攻，我们认为在这四个行业中的每一个都有许多有趣的投资理念，我们不会做出任何妥协。此外，对于每个标的，我们都有不同的、强劲的长期投资论点驱动因素。您在印度长大，我曾在播客上听您谈论食物，那么您是如何为您的投资组合增添风味的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I have deliberately focused on these four verticals: **enterprise data** (broadly tech), **financial services**, **healthcare services**, and **industrial technologies**. Because I felt that these are the areas where these themes of emerging technology disruption are most relevant, and where you can see market leaders with very durable **moats** that work for incremental returns, and the path to deploy capital on that incremental return is clearer today given current technology trends. So we only focus on these four areas, and we also think about **thematic exposure**, and the reason for this is very straightforward. Firstly, I think it gives you an opportunity to play offense. Because at some point, due to the passive nature of market structure, a slight odd factor rotation can disrupt a portfolio. This gives us an opportunity to play offense during those periods, and we feel that in each of these four sectors, there are many interesting investment ideas where we are not making any kind of compromise. In addition, for each name, we have different and strong drivers for a long-term thesis. You grew up in India, and I heard you talk about food on a podcast, so how do you spice up your portfolio?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为**质量**是我们的调味品。我们专注于那些拥有**护城河**并能长期持续发展的企业。我们有非常**去偏见化**的数据追踪方法，这些方法并非仅仅基于我或团队的直觉，而是真正基于**系统性思维**，而非孤立思维。这就是调味品。我认为这确实非常令人兴奋，因为它是一个极其难以思考的问题，而且要做好它非常具有挑战性，我认为有必要多谈谈它，**Nikolai**，您自己也是投资过程的学生。但您知道，我们都非常喜欢**Kahneman**、**Tversky**和**Thaler**的作品，对吗？我记得有一次我父亲给了我**Bertrand Russell**的一句精彩名言：“人类无所不能，除了不愿思考。”这非常直接。就像**Kahneman**谈论**系统一思维**和**系统二思维**一样。**系统一思维**是那种直觉的、本能的感觉，它实际上是积极的。它帮助人类在日常任务中做出快速流畅的反应，而且效果很好。但**系统二思维**，它非常困难，它需要真正深入、有条理、逻辑性地思考。所以我总是努力确保我的团队和我们的投资组合是由**系统二思维**驱动的。在这里我必须插一句，我曾经为了我的硕士论文采访过您。[笑声] 没错。关于决策，这实际上就是主题。那么请告诉我，您何时使用直觉，何时使用分析？在您的职业生涯中，您对**模式识别**的使用发生了怎样的变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I consider **quality** to be the spice for us. We focus on businesses that have **moats** and can last for a long duration. And we have very **de-biased** ways of tracking data that are not based solely on my or the team's intuition, but are actually based on **systematic thinking**, not siloed thinking. That's the spice. I think it's really exciting because it's an incredibly difficult thing to think about, and doing it well is very challenging, and I think it's important to talk about it a bit more, and **Nikolai**, you yourself have been a student of the investment process. But you know, we both love the work of **Kahneman**, **Tversky**, and **Thaler**, right? I remember once my father gave me a wonderful quote from **Bertrand Russell**, which was, 'Men are capable of anything, except they don't want to think.' And it's very straightforward. Just as **Kahneman** talks about **System One** and **System Two thinking**. **System One thinking** is that intuitive gut feeling, which is actually positive. It helps humanity to give quick and fluid reactions in day-to-day tasks, and it works very well. But **System Two thinking**, which is very difficult, which is really thinking deeply and methodically and logically. So I always try to make sure that my team and our portfolio are driven by **System Two thinking**. Here I have to interject that I once interviewed you for my master's thesis. [laughter] That's right. In decision-making, which was actually about this. So tell me, when do you use intuition and when do you use analysis? So how has your use of **pattern recognition** changed during your career?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 在我的**模式识别**中，我认为发生的变化是，我现在更多地考虑**背景**，而不是个体分析观点。所以，也许我以前更强调个人、首席执行官、领导力或英雄模式，而没有足够关注公司和企业运作的社会背景。我通过艰难的学习才认识到这一点。我见过许多失败。我的第一份工作是在**世界银行**担任初级分析师，在俄罗斯和蒙古工作。我去了那里。这是一个非常深刻的例子。我当时去那里时想着，“好吧，当我们接管这些国有公司时，我们会对它们进行估值。我们会通过不同的地方银行分支机构分发股票。我们会开放股票市场。资本主义、自由民主，一切都会很棒。历史的终结。”结果发生的事情却有些不同，对吗？相反，许多腐败和错误做法迅速蔓延。**独裁**在所有这些国家兴起，即使在今天，这些同样的事情仍在新闻头条中。你不能仅仅忽视或割裂70年的**共产主义历史**，并期望人们一夜之间采纳一种全新的思维方式。我认为今天也是如此。当你自下而上地审视企业时，理解整个**背景**非常重要。你必须通过望远镜和显微镜来观察，这样你才能系统而清晰地思考这些企业在当今的背景下将如何演变。所以，这是我思考很多的问题：我们如何纠正我们对这些具体失败的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: In my **pattern recognition**, I think the change that has come is that now I think more about **context** rather than individual analytical viewpoints. And so perhaps I previously gave more emphasis to the person or the CEO or leadership or the hero model, and did not pay as much attention to the social context in which companies and businesses were operating. And I learned this the hard way. I have seen many failures. My first job at the **World Bank** was working as a junior analyst in Russia and Mongolia. I went there. This is a very poignant example. I went there thinking, 'Okay, when we take over these state-owned companies, we will value them. We will distribute tickets through different local bank branches. We will open stock markets. Capitalism, liberal democracy, everything will be great. The end of history.' What happened turned out to be a bit different, right? Instead, a lot of corrupt and wrong practices rapidly grew. **Autocracy** emerged in all these countries, and even today, these same things are in the news headlines. You can't just ignore or separate 70 years of **communist history** and expect people to adopt a completely new way of thinking overnight. I think the same is true today. When you are looking at businesses from the bottom up, it is very important to understand the entire **context**. You have to look through binoculars and microscopes so that you can think systematically and clearly about how these businesses will evolve in the context they are in today. So, this is something I think a lot about: how we correct our thinking about these specific failures.

### 私募市场与新想法的发现

**Nikolai**: 您也可以投资**私营公司**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: You can also invest in **private companies**.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。那么您为什么决定这样做呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes. So why did you decide to do that?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为我们显然知道，**私营部门**存在着非常大的市值和大型公司，我们也知道，**公开市场**中的公司数量现在不如以前，实际上，它们的数量在一段时间内减少了很多。因此，除了这些趋势之外，关注**私募市场**的另一个原因是，它们往往是最具**颠覆性**的。变革发生在边缘，而不是核心，对吗？这是我的基本观点，而在边缘的是小型企业、私营公司、那些正在崭露头角的无名创始人。变革将发生在边缘。因此，确保我们的网络和思维不仅在美国，而且在全球这四个领域——我们关注的这四个大行业——都是我们的责任。与私营公司交流是这个过程的一部分。就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think we obviously know that there are very large market caps and large companies present in the **private sector**, and we also know that there are fewer companies in the **public markets** now than before; in fact, their number has decreased quite a bit over time. So, in addition to these trends, another reason to look at **private markets** is that they are often the most **disruptive**. Change happens at the edges, not at the core, right? This is my fundamental view, and at the edges are small businesses, private companies, unsung founders who are just emerging. That's where change will happen at the margins. So, it's our responsibility to ensure that our networks and thinking are not just in America but globally in these four sectors. These four big industries that we focus on. Talking to private companies is part of that process. It's that simple.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您是如何寻找新想法的？比如，您早上醒来会想：“砰，我需要看看这个”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: How do you find new ideas? Like, do you wake up in the morning and think, 'Bang, I need to look at this'?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我并不是早上醒来就想：“砰，我需要看看这个。”实际上，这是一个漫长的过程。对我来说，这是一个漫长的**想法孵化过程**。所以我读很多书，思考很多，然后和我的团队交谈，并与我们拥有的任何更广泛的网络进行讨论。但正如我之前所说，变革发生在边缘，所以这实际上是关于深入实地。它是关于去参加那些鲜为人知的行业贸易展，那些展示自动化、新型**机器人系统**的展会，在那里我可能会得到一个新想法。它可能是一个我们持续在**AI**开发者和非技术行业之间进行的调查，以了解他们实际在做什么，他们在尝试什么，哪些有效，哪些无效。所以，我想说，它实际上更多地来自一个更鲜为人知的视角，我从那里获得最好的想法，而不是仅仅与现有的大型参与者交谈，尽管那显然也很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So it's not like I wake up in the morning and think, 'Bang, I need to look at this.' Actually, it's a long process. For me, it's a long **incubation process** for ideas. So I read a lot, think a lot, and then talk to my team and discuss with whatever broader networks we have. But then, as I said before, change happens at the edges, so it's actually about going into the field. It's about going to that obscure industry trade show that features automation, new **robotic systems**, where I might get a new idea. It could be an ongoing survey that we are constantly conducting between **AI** developers and non-tech industries to see what they are actually working on, what they are trying, what is working, and what is not working. So, I would say it actually comes from a more obscure perspective, where I get my best ideas, rather than just talking to existing big players, although that's obviously important.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 那么，当您有了一个想法之后，您会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So what do you do with an idea once you have it?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 下一步，正如您之前问到的关于直觉、**系统一思维**和**系统二思维**的问题，就是将其通过一个非常精细的过滤器，也就是**整体投资清单**。我非常相信**清单驱动的方法**。我们经历这个过程，然后，正如我之前谈到**偏见**时所说，我们确保有办法追踪论点，并且我们能够抓住那根绳子。这样做的原因是，我认为我们容易受到许多带有华丽名称的偏见的影响，对吗？比如**确认偏误**、**可用性偏误**或**沉没成本偏误**。当我回顾我的许多投资错误时，它们都是由于这些偏见中的一个或另一个造成的。这是非常人性化的。这是自然的，其中一些也具有积极的方面。但对于投资来说，可能就少了一些。所以我希望确保我们有数据点，能够以**无偏见**的方式将投资论点联系起来，以便投资团队和我能够追踪它，并确保我们没有忽视可能成为论点逆风的问题。所以我在这方面投入了大量时间。我还花费大量时间确保，你知道，我们谈论遗漏和佣金的错误。但我也希望我们避免犯错误。所以我的很多时间也花在思考哪些假设可能错误。哪些地方可能出错。哪些地方可能发生市场颠覆？这也是我关注的一点。**FOMO**（错失恐惧症）可能是最大的问题，对吗？所以我告诉我的团队，“让我们从**FOMO**转向**TOMO**：**深思熟虑地错过**（Thoughtfully Missing Out）”，确保我们正在关注任何新的趋势。也许我们可以尝试扩大我们的**能力圈**。但如果不能，那么我们需要明确我们的**能力圈**是什么，不断扩大它，但界限应该清晰。所以我想说，我的想法更多地是关于引导团队，而不是关于具体的股票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: The next step, as you asked earlier about intuition, **System One**, and **System Two thinking**, is to put it through a very fine filter, which is the **overall investment checklist**. I strongly believe in a **checklist-driven approach**. We go through this process, and then, as I said earlier about **biases**, we ensure that we have a way to track the thesis and also that we can hold onto that rope. And the reason for this is that I think we are susceptible to many biases with colorful names, right? Like **confirmation bias**, **availability bias**, or **sunk cost bias**. When I look at many of my investment mistakes, they were all due to one or another of these biases. This is very human. It's natural, and some of them have positive aspects. But for investing, perhaps a little less so. So that's why I want to make sure that we have data points that allow us to link the investment thesis in an **unbiased** way so that the investment team and I can track it and see that we are not ignoring issues that could become headwinds for the thesis. So I spend a lot of time on this. I also spend a lot of time making sure that, you know, we talk about errors of omission and commission. But I also want us to avoid making mistakes. So a lot of my time is also spent thinking about what assumptions are being made that might be wrong. Where things can go wrong. Where market disruptions can happen? And this is also something I pay attention to. **FOMO** is perhaps the biggest problem, right? So I tell my team, 'Let's move from **FOMO** to **TOMO**: **Thoughtfully Missing Out**,' ensuring that we are looking at whatever new flavor there is. Perhaps we can try to expand our **circle of competence**. But if we can't, then we need to be clear about what our **circle of competence** is, keep expanding it, but the boundaries should be clear. So I would say that my ideas are as much about steering the team as they are about specific stocks.

**Nikolai**: 您如何使用它们？它们是做决策，还是帮助您做决策？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: How do you use them? Do they make decisions, or do they help you make decisions?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我的团队经验非常丰富，我很幸运能与这个小团队合作，他们都拥有十年或更长时间的**选股经验**，我将他们视为我的合作者。我真的认为他们是我的决策过程中非常重要的人。我认为这非常像一项团队运动，所以需要一个强大的团队。我将自己视为教练和导师。**SurgoCap**的一个重要驱动力就是吸引和培养下一批杰出的投资人才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: My team is very experienced, and I'm lucky to work with this small group who have a decade or more of **stock-picking experience**, and I use them as my collaborators. I truly consider them as people who are very important to my decision-making process. I think this is very much a team sport, so a strong team is needed. I see myself as a coach and mentor. A big driver of **SurgoCap** is to attract and mentor the next round of brilliant investment talent.

**Nikolai**: 那么，深思熟虑地错过。有哪些**危险信号**会让您远离某件事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So, thoughtfully missing out. What are the **red flags** that would keep you away from something?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。在我看来，第一个是**妥协**。如果您仅仅因为估值而投资一家企业，或者如果您投资一位创始人，认为他们是下一个救世主，但却忽视了其他问题，那么这就是一个**危险信号**。实际上，在做出投资决策时过于情绪化。每当我看到这种情况，或者当我对自己某件事过于兴奋时，我都会将其视为一个**危险信号**。我们应该确保我们以平衡和深思熟虑的方式考虑企业的所有方面，而不是只关注一个方面。我认为这就是**偏见**自然而然产生的地方。因为我们人类天生就被设定去寻找那个重大而激动人心的时刻。那是我们的进化，对吗？我们当时正在寻找那个即将攻击我们的捕食者。但实际上，我认为在当今世界，事情并非那么简单。事实上，它极其复杂，有许多因素可能是对的，也可能是错的，而花时间在所有这些方面，这就是我希望我们做到的。如果我们不这样做，我就会犯错误。放下情绪并不容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes. So, in my view, the first is **compromise**. If you are investing in a business solely because of valuation, or if you are investing in a founder believing them to be the next Messiah, but there are other problems you are ignoring, then that's a **red flag**. Actually, being too emotional in making investment decisions. Whenever I see that, or when I myself get too excited about something, I consider it a **red flag**. We should ensure that we are considering all aspects of the business in a balanced and thoughtful way, rather than focusing on just one. And I think that's where **bias** naturally comes in. Because we humans are naturally wired to find that big, exciting moment. That was our evolution, right? We were looking for that predator that was about to attack us. But actually, I think in today's world, it's not that simple. In fact, it's extremely complex, and there are many factors that can be right and can also be wrong, and spending time on all these aspects is what I look for us to do. If we don't, I make mistakes. It's not easy to let go of emotions.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为您需要一套方法论和流程，将其引入您的**系统二思维**，并创建工具，让您和您的团队能够朝着这个方向前进。请记住，当我们谈论市场本质时，股票受**叙事**驱动的程度与受**数字**驱动的程度一样大。所以您应该尊重这种背景，并欣赏理解这种背景。即使在**苏联**的最后几天，它也曾多么强大，我认为我们需要平衡这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think you need to have a methodology and process that brings it into your **System Two thinking** and creates tools that allow you and your team to move in that direction. Remember, as soon as we talk about the nature of markets, stocks are driven as much by **narrative** as they are by **numbers**. So you should respect that context and appreciate understanding that context. Even in the last days of the **Soviet Union**, and how powerful it was, and I think we need to balance this.

### 长期护城河与投资案例

**Nikolai**: 您提到了**护城河**，长期**护城河**，作为一种决定性的品质。那么您还在寻找哪些其他类型的**品质信号**呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: You mentioned **moats**, long-term **moats**, as a definitional quality. So what other kinds of **quality signs** are you looking for?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 所以当我谈论**护城河**时，我指的是一个以高**增量投资资本回报率**（ROIC）运营的企业，因为归根结底，一个企业的价值取决于它从增量投资资本中获得的**回报**，而您会将这些资本部署到您可以获得的回报上，对吗？所以这是一个平衡，即什么驱动**ROIC**，然后将其倍增。有很多方法，但实际上最好的方法是什么？如果仅仅通过提价，我不喜欢那样。但如果通过**功能创新**、**市场增长**、**新地理区域**或**新产品**，同时伴随提价，那么这很棒。所以拥有多个杠杆来驱动**ROIC**是一件大事。其次，您可以在这些增量回报上部署多少资本？有些企业，特别是那些优秀的企业，拥有高增量回报。但它们部署这些资本的能力正在减弱。那种增长市场已经不复存在了。这就是为什么试图理解它是什么类型的企业，以及如果它们拥有大量可以部署的资本，而我们今天在技术领域看到了这一点，那么**执行风险**就非常高。所以我认为我们需要看到我们获得的**回报**与部署的资本水平相对于现有企业的销售额和规模相称，因为这会增加**执行风险**，我需要对此进行大量思考。我认为**增量回报**的组合，您可以将资本部署到这些回报中，并且有方法来管理其中一个的积极方面和另一个的**执行风险**的消极方面。这些都是我们思考的所有事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So when I talk about **moats**, I mean a business that operates on high **incremental ROIC**, because ultimately the value of a business depends on the **return** it gets from incremental invested capital, and you will deploy that capital on the returns you can get, right? So it's a balance of what drives **ROIC**, and then multiplying it. There are many ways, but what are actually the best ways? If it's just by raising prices, I don't like that. But if it's through **feature innovation**, **market growth**, **new geographies**, or **new products** along with price increases, then that's great. So having multiple levers to drive **ROIC** is a big deal. Secondly, how much capital can you deploy on those incremental returns? Some businesses, especially the excellent ones, have high incremental returns, but their capacity to deploy that capital is diminishing. That kind of growth market is no longer there. That's why trying to understand what kind of business it is, and if they have a lot of capital they can deploy, and we are seeing this in the technology sector today, then the **execution risk** is very high. So I think we need to see that we are getting returns commensurate with the level of capital deployed relative to the sales and size of the existing business, because that increases **execution risk**, which I need to think a lot about. I think the combination of **incremental return**, the capital you can deploy into those returns, having ways to manage the positive in one and the negative of **execution risk** in the other. These are all the things we think about.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 那么，不谈论您目前投资组合中的任何东西，但请举一个您做过的符合其中一些观点的优秀投资的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So without talking about anything you currently have in the portfolio, but give an example of a great investment you've made that fits some of these points.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，我想说，从大规模来看，我们在之前的职位上也进行过一些这样的投资，这也是这些业务最棒的地方。我认为现在真正有趣的是**芯片**领域正在发生的事情，所以我们在这方面投入了大量时间。所以您有像**台积电**（TSMC）这样的知名企业，它们几乎垄断了市场，特别是在**工艺工程**方面。所以它实际上不仅仅是关于一件事，而是许多事情的组合。这就是为什么我喜欢这种**系统性护城河**，它不是一个简单的小事情。不是说城市里只有金矿，而是拥有从矿中提取黄金的工艺。我喜欢拥有这种动态的企业。我还认为**AI**的**芯片层**正在发生一些非常有趣的事情。关于**训练**的讨论很多。但我认为训练有点困难，而**推理**（inference）才是真正的赚钱之道，对吗？所以最终，我们每天都会让模型做这项工作，它们将存在于特定的**大型语言模型**（LLM）中。**Google**将拥有自己的**推理栈**，**OpenAI**、**Anthropic**和其他公司也是如此。我认为**Google**的**TPU**（张量处理单元）周围正在发生的事情在降低成本方面确实非常有趣。所以**ASIC**，或**ASIC芯片**，即为特定工作负载设计的**应用专用芯片**，正因为如此，它们创造了非常持久的优势，这就是为什么我们非常关注这种主题。我们之前谈到了**医疗技术**。但我认为**市场进入护城河**（go-to-market moats）与持续增长的**流程创新**的结合，以及它涉及全球大量的医生、护士执业者群体，他们实际上正在执行这些工作。这也产生了很大的参与度。所以我认为这是另一个领域，大型企业正在真正崛起并已经建立起来。所以在**芯片栈层**周围发生的事情中，这可能是两大类，而**医疗技术层**已经持续了20年，所以它并不新鲜。我认为还有另一个有趣的类别，有一种观点认为**AI**实际上可能比它看起来更具颠覆性，所以我认为在**实时数据**和**数据分析**中存在一些专有数据提供商。我认为它们确实非常有趣，是真正优秀的企业。它们同时拥有**记录系统**（systems of record）和**工作流系统**（systems of workflow），这三者结合起来，再加上一个非常基本的创新引擎，通常会创造出非常强大的**护城河**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes, I would say that on a large scale, we have made some of these investments in our previous roles as well, and that's the best thing about these businesses. I think what's really interesting right now is what's happening with **chips**, so we're spending a lot of time on that. So you have businesses like **TSMC**, which are well-known, which have pretty much cornered the market, especially in aspects of **process engineering**. So it's actually not just about one thing, but a combination of many things. That's why I like such **systematic moats** where there isn't one small, easy thing. It's not just that there's a gold mine in the city, but owning the process of how gold is extracted from the mine. I like businesses that have these kinds of dynamics. I also think there's something very interesting happening in the **chip layer** of **AI** right now. Where there's been a lot of talk about **training**. But I think training is a bit difficult, but **inference** is the real money-maker, right? So ultimately, we're going to make models do this work every day, and these will be inside specific **LLMs**. **Google** will have its own **inference stack**, **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and others. And I think what's happening around **Google**'s **TPUs** is really interesting in terms of reducing this. So **ASICs**, or **ASIC chips**, **application-specific chips** that are designed for specific workloads, and because of this, they create very long-lasting advantages, and that's why we are paying a lot of attention to this kind of theme. We talked about **medical technology** earlier. But I think the combination of **go-to-market moats** and continuously increasing **process innovation**, and it involves a large group of doctors, nurse practitioners around the world who are actually executing it. This also creates a lot of engagement. So I think this is another area where big businesses are really emerging and have already been built. So in what's happening around the **chip stack layer**, these are perhaps the two big buckets, and the **med-tech layer** that has been going on for the last 20 years, so it's not new. I think there's another interesting category too, where there's a view that **AI** is perhaps actually disrupting a little more than it is, and so I think there are some proprietary data providers within **real-time data** and **data analytics**. I think they are really interesting and truly great businesses. Where they have both **systems of record** and **systems of workflow** together, and these three together, with a very basic innovation engine, often create very strong **moats**.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 那会是哪种类型的公司呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: What kind of companies would those be?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 那么这些将是提供**金融数据**的企业。所以想想您的投资组合所需的**外汇清算**或**固定收益**或**股票市场**所需的所有**实时定价**。我认为这些是**实时数据**，对于像**大型语言模型**（LLM）这样的东西来说，由于其**实时性**，将很难改变，因为它们嵌入在围绕交易和合规的真实工作流中，这些工作流也极难改变。所以人们认为**AI模型**可以取代它们。但我认为这对我来说几乎很难看到或理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So these would be businesses that, for example, provide **financial data**. So think about all the **real-time pricing** needed for **FX clearance** or **fixed income** or **equity markets**, even for your portfolio. I think these are **real-time data** that would be very difficult for something like an **LLM** to ever change, because of their **real-time nature**. But they are embedded in the real workflows around trading and compliance, which are also very difficult to change. So people have this idea that **AI models** can remove them. But I think it's almost very difficult for me to see or understand that.

</details>

### 投资时间跨度与做空策略

**Nikolai**: 当您投资或思考时，您的**时间跨度**是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: When you invest or think, what is your **time horizon**?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 尽可能长，显然**做空**是不同的。它们更多是**催化剂驱动**的，通常**催化剂周期**不到9个月。但在**做多**方面，正如我所说，我依靠我的流程来寻找**持久性**。所以我们真正寻找的是驱动**增量回报**和可以部署到该**增量回报**上的资本的因素组合，这些因素实际上根据我们的**估值范围**在3到5年的周期内可见。但理想情况下，我们也会寻找超越这个范围的杠杆。那么**做空**与**做多投资**相比如何？同一个人可以同时做这两种操作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: As long as possible, obviously **shorts** are different. They are more **catalyst-driven** and usually have **catalyst periods** of less than 9 months. But on the **long side**, as I said, I rely on my process to look for **duration**. So we are really looking for a combination of factors that drive **incremental returns** and capital that can be deployed on that **incremental return**, which are actually visible in a 3 to 5-year cycle according to our **valuation horizon**. But ideally, we look for levers beyond that. So how does **shorting** compare to **long investing**? Can the same person do both?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 这是一个很好的问题，因为它实际上是**做多**的另一块肌肉，正如您所知。它实际上是关于思考它。所以有时您会看到清晰的**做空机会**，它们是**做多**的破碎镜像。X正在赢，Y正在输。我认为这些非常少见，很少见到，通常这还不够。我认为除此之外，您还需要把握好时机，即这些赢或输的动态何时会真正发挥作用。通常，它通过某种组合发生。比如清晰的**价格竞争压力**，清晰的**份额竞争压力**，这些会导致**定价压力**，然后这些与管理层执行不力等其他因素结合起来，您就会有一个相当好的**做空机会**。但问题是，在您所需的时间框架内拥有这些因素的组合是一项艰巨的任务。然后再加上各种**因素轮动**和当今市场的**被动性**，这通常由**量化基金**、**ETF**和其他基金驱动。您有许多驱动交易的动态，您需要思考这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: That's a very good question because it's actually the other muscle of the **long side**, as you know. It's actually about thinking about it. So sometimes you'll see clear **shorts** that are broken mirror images of longs. X is winning, Y is losing. I think these are very few and rarely seen, and usually, that's not enough. I think in addition to that, you need to get the timing right as to when those winning or losing dynamics will actually play out. Usually, it happens through some combination. Like clear **price competitive pressure**, clear **share competitive pressure** that leads to those **pricing pressures**, and then those combined with other factors like poor execution by management, you have a pretty good, pretty good short. But the problem is that having that combination of factors within the time frame you need is a difficult task. And then add to that all kinds of **factor rotations** and the **passive nature** of today's market, which is often driven by **quants** and **ETFs** and other funds. You have many dynamics that are driving trading that you need to think about.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您会**做空**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Do you short?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们会**做空**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: We do short.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 这非常非常紧张。[笑声] 老实说，这意味着我喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: It's very, very stressful. [laughter] Honestly, it means I like it.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 因为您，因为您错了那么久，而当您对了，它就像爆发一样，对吗？而且它们持续不了多久。您可能在一周内非常正确，然后您又错了两年，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Because you, because you're wrong for so long, and when you're right, it's just like bursts, right? And they don't last very long. You might be very right for a week, and then you're wrong again for two years, right?

</details>

**Nikolai**: 这很难，您会承受痛苦。您寻找绝对利润的**做空机会**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: It's difficult, and you suffer the pain. You look for absolute profit dollar shorts.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您关心**估值**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Do you care about **valuation**?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，我认为**估值**非常重要。我们关注**自由现金流倍数**。我们核销**股权激励**。我们采用所有传统方法，并以相当保守的方式看待事物。这样做的原因正如我之前所说，是为了管理风险。所以考虑到这一点，我思考的是**风险调整后的回报**，我认为**估值**以及您预先支付的金额是其中非常重要的一部分，尤其是在考虑**估值**和市场中的**信息不对称**时，这一点更为重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes, I think **valuation** matters a lot. We look at **free cash flow multiples**. We expense **stock-based comp**. We use all the old methods and look at things quite conservatively. And the reason for that is what I said earlier about the desire to manage risk. So thinking about this, I think about **risk-adjusted returns**, and I think **valuation** and how much you pay upfront is a very big part of that, and especially thinking about **valuation** and **information asymmetries** in the market is even more important.

</details>

### Lone Pine Capital的经验教训

**Nikolai**: 让我们回到您在**Lone Pine**的时光，我的意思是，您是和**Steve Mandel**一起创立的。您在**Lone Pine**学到了哪些重要的经验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Let's go back to your time at **Lone Pine**, and as I mean, you started it with **Steve Mandel**. What important lessons did you learn from your time at **Lone Pine**?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，我认为有很多。我的意思是，我很幸运有机会在那里与**Steve**以及一群杰出的人一起工作。我想说，我学到的最大教训之一就是我们谈论的**偏见**。我给您举一个非常具体的例子，您谈到了**做空**。我们可以从**做空**开始。我在**Lone Pine**犯的最大错误之一就是**做空诺基亚**（Nokia）。我做空了**诺基亚**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes, I think there were many things. I mean, and I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with **Steve** and a group of many brilliant people there. I would say one of the biggest lessons I learned was the one we talked about regarding **bias**. Let me give you a very specific example, and you talked about **shorts**. We can start with **shorts**. One of my biggest mistakes at **Lone Pine** was **shorting Nokia**. And I shorted **Nokia**.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 它最终下跌了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: It eventually went down.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 这就是有趣的地方。所以我认为我完全正确，然后显然在2014年，**微软**（Microsoft）以70亿美元收购了它，那对我来说和我的公司来说都是非常痛苦的一天，然后18个月后，**微软**将其**减记**了。它结束了，所以您可能是对的，也可能完全是错的，就像您之前在**做空**方面所说的那样。那么这一切的教训是什么？教训是：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So that's the interesting thing. So I thought I was absolutely right, and then obviously in 2014, **Microsoft** came and bought it for $7 billion, and that was a very painful day for me and my firm, and then 18 months later, **Microsoft** wrote it off. It was over, and so you can be right and you can also be completely wrong, as you said earlier on the **short side**. So what was the lesson in all this? The lesson is this.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 如果您将一家企业视为一个独立的业务。是的，您是对的。很棒。然而，您实际上并没有考虑该企业随着时间推移的所有其他**战略价值**。所以，思考一个企业不是孤立的，而是以更**系统化**的方式，但不是孤立的部分，这是我必须反复学习的事情，也是我教给我的团队的。所以，**系统化**，而不是孤立思考。这是第一点，**诺基亚**的例子就是其中之一。第二点是避免**资产负债表杠杆**，比如**公开市场杠杆收购**（LBOs），我通过艰难的方式学到，也许这不适合我，我犯过错误，投资了那些过度杠杆化的好企业，它们确实是很好的企业，但结果是，当困难时期和必要的维护到来时，它们几乎没有运营能力。所以这是另一个重要的教训，我在那里犯了错误，比如在**Altice**这样的企业中。至于第三点，我认为也许是最有趣的，回到我们关于**AI芯片**的讨论，以及旧技术如何以新方式造成颠覆，那就是**英伟达**（Nvidia）。**英伟达**完全将自己视为一家**GPU**企业，它也确实是，但随后在2015年，我们看到了**深度强化学习**、**DeepMind**的论文，这非常有趣和令人兴奋，您开始看到**并行计算**将是多么重要。**GPU**将如何有助于这种**并行计算**。实际上，它们对于驱动**机器学习**的新引擎，即**并行计算**的运作是必要的。我们当时不知道**生成式AI**会发生。但您肯定看到了**机器学习**早期阶段正在发生的事情，它后来演变成了**生成式AI**。事实是，当时除了用于视频游戏的**GPU**之外，还有一个很大的**加密货币**组成部分。当时，**游戏**和**加密货币**正在推动**英伟达**。我说：“是的，但这个**AI**会发生，而且会非常大。”结果他们错过了，而且你看，很大程度上，**加密货币**同时崩溃了，而**游戏**也受到中国许可证延迟的影响，这在当时是视频游戏业务需求的一个主要驱动因素。所以我卖掉了它，这是我不应该做的。但重要的是，那是一个错误。但最大的错误不是那个。最大的错误是后来没有再看**英伟达**。所以我认为这种**沉没成本偏误**非常强大，这就是为什么我现在在**SurgoCap**投入这么多时间，以确保我们不断对现有的想法集进行强有力的调查，并确保我们不断修订它们，包括那些我们错过的名字，以确保我们不会一次又一次地陷入这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: If you think of a business as a standalone business. Yes, you were right. Great. However, you didn't actually think about all the other **strategic value** of the business over time. So thinking about a business not in isolation but in a more **systematic** way, but not in silos, this is something I have to learn again and again, and something I teach my team. So **systematic**, not siloed thinking. That's number one, and the **Nokia** example is one. And the second is avoiding **balance sheet leverage**, like public **LBOs**, and I've learned the hard way that perhaps it's not for me, and I've made mistakes where I invested in good businesses that were overleveraged, quite good businesses, they were overleveraged, but as a result, when difficult times and necessary maintenance came, they had very little capacity to operate. So that's another big lesson, and I made mistakes there, like in businesses like **Altice**. As for the third, I think perhaps the most interesting, going back to our discussion on **AI chips** and how old technology can cause disruption in new ways, which is **Nvidia**. So **Nvidia** completely saw itself as a **GPU** business, which it was, but then in 2015, we had the **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, **DeepMind** papers, and it was very interesting and exciting, and you started to see how important **parallel compute** would be. How **GPUs** would be helpful for that **parallel compute**. Actually, they would be necessary for making that new engine of **machine learning**, that **parallel compute**, work. We didn't know that **generative AI** was going to happen. But you definitely saw what was happening in the early stages of **machine learning**, which later became **generative AI**. And the truth is, at that time, besides **GPUs** for video games, there was also a big **crypto** component. At that time, **gaming** and **crypto** were driving **Nvidia**. And I said, 'Yes, but this **AI** thing will happen, and it will be very big.' It turned out that they missed it, and look, to a large extent, **crypto** crashed simultaneously, and **gaming** was affected due to permit delays in China, which was a big driver of demand for the video gaming part of the business at that time. So I sold it, which I shouldn't have done. But the big thing is, that was a mistake. But the big mistake wasn't that. The big mistake was not looking at **Nvidia** again later. So I think this **sunk cost bias** is very powerful, and that's why I now spend so much time at **Surgo** to ensure that we keep doing a robust survey of the idea sets out there and ensure that we continuously revise them, including those names we missed, to make sure we don't fall into this problem again and again.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 以更低的价格买回您卖掉的东西非常困难。没有人同意。我认为，我认为正因为它如此困难，所以对于新想法来说，这是一个非常重要和有趣的机会。当您犯错时，这经常发生，至少对我来说是这样，那么我认为这可能是三个具有明确教训的坚实例子。一个是关于**系统性思维**而非孤立思维。第二个是关于对**金融杠杆**保持谨慎，而不是我们都乐于接受的其他**杠杆驱动因素**。第三个是关于我们之前谈到的这些**偏见**，包括**沉没成本偏误**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: It's very difficult to buy back things you've sold at a lower price. No one agrees. I think, I think because it's so difficult, it's a very important and interesting opportunity for new ideas. When you're wrong, which often happens, and at least for me, it does, then I think these are perhaps three solid examples with clear lessons. One about **systematic**, not isolated thinking. Second about being cautious about **financial leverage** versus other drivers of leverage that we are all happy about. And third about these **biases** we talked about earlier, including **sunk cost bias**.

### 多元文化背景与社会服务

**Nikolai**: 那么**Mala**，我想问您一些稍微个人化的问题。您认为，我的意思是，您在美国和印度都生活过一段时间。您认为这种**多元文化背景**是否影响了您看待世界和投资的方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: So **Mala**, I'd like to ask you some questions of a slightly personal nature. Do you think, I mean, you grew up partly in the US and partly in India. Do you think this **multicultural background** influences the way you see the world and investing?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 在很大程度上，我会说。在印度长大，在一个不像今天这样，一个非常安静的城市长大。那时，它实际上被认为是一个退休城市。我的父母都是，我母亲是医生，我父亲是学者，他们在那里以这种身份工作。在许多方面，那是一种非常安静、非常学术、非常知识分子的成长环境。但我并非不知道当时印度的严酷现实。一个在许多方面被竖立的围墙所困扰的印度。那是一个**封闭经济**，被称为“**许可证制度**”（License Raj），很明显，这给整个经济带来了真正的问题，即使在我小时候也是如此。但我认为，看到**收入不平等**的程度，也是令人震惊的，不仅在印度，而且在全世界，它的危险对我来说变得非常清楚，而对机构缺乏信任，这常常导致**腐败**，是我从小就经历的事情，它无处不在。我认为这至少在我心中灌输了一种非常强烈的**回馈和服务**的意识，我认为这部分也来自我的家庭。我的曾祖母曾入狱，因为她在**甘地**领导的**自由运动**中工作，我认为**社会服务**以及您如何回馈社会的理念，因在印度长大的社会现实而进一步加强。现在，说了这么多，它在某些方面也非常棒。部分原因在于当地文化和当地动态非常强大，并且有非常丰富的文学、历史和自我理解，这在某种程度上也源于当时印度非常非常封闭的事实。所以我认为，所有这一切的结果是，我对印度以什么闻名，它今天变成了什么，以及它未来会变成什么感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: To a great extent, I would say. Growing up in India, growing up in a place that wasn't what it is today, a very quiet city. At that time, it was actually considered a retirement city. Both my parents, my mother is a doctor, my father is an academic, and they worked there in that capacity. And it was in many ways a very quiet, very academic, very intellectual upbringing. But I was not unaware of the very harsh realities of India at that time. An India that was in many ways troubled by the walls that had been erected. It was a **closed economy** at that time, called the **License Raj**, and it was very clear that this was causing real problems for the economy overall, even as a young girl growing up. But I think seeing the level of **income inequality** is also something that is shocking, not just in India but around the world, and its dangers became very clear to me, and the lack of trust in institutions, which often leads to **corruption**, was something I grew up with, and it was all around me. And I think this is something that has at least instilled in me a very strong sense of **giving back and service**, and I think this is partly my family as well. My great-grandmother was in jail because she was working in the **freedom movement** under **Gandhi**, and I think the idea of **social service** and how you give back was further strengthened by the social realities of growing up in India. Now, having said all that, it was also wonderful in some ways. Partly because the local culture and local dynamics were very strong, and there was a very rich literature and history and self-understanding that also came somewhat from the fact that India was very, very closed at that time. And so I think as a result of all this, I felt very proud of what India is known for, what it has become today, and what it will become in the future.

### 女性在投资界与多重身份

**Nikolai**: 您是许多女性的榜样，我认为当您推出您的基金时，那是任何女性有史以来最大的**对冲基金**发行。对吗？这真的非常非常了不起。对于在投资界做一名女性，您有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: You are a role model for many women, and I think when you launched your fund, it was the biggest launch, the biggest **hedge fund** launch by any woman ever, right? That's really, really amazing. Any thoughts on being a woman in the investment world?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我想说，首先，我希望这个记录很快就会被打破，我相信它会的。那里有一些真正有才华的女性。我希望我不仅能成为女性的榜样，也能成为更广泛的投资界，也许以后是慈善界的榜样。这是我工作、原则和身份中非常重要的一部分。我真的觉得投资行业，广义上讲，是一个非常好的行业。无论您是何种类型的局外人。它是我能想象到的最**精英主义**的行业。我的意思是，我可能是一个头上长着两只角的绿色火星人。但如果我能带来投资回报，门外就会排着队的人，那些想购买我产品的人，对吗？所以我认为这是一个非常**精英主义**的行业，我只希望像**SurgoCap**这样的地方以及您在这里运营的平台，能够为这个行业中的更多人增加价值，因为我真的认为对于那些**求知欲强**的人来说，这是一个绝佳的地方，各种各样的人都可以来为世界做出贡献。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I would say, first of all, I hope this record will be broken very soon, and I'm sure it will be. There are some truly talented women out there. I hope I will be a role model not just for women, but for the broader investment community and perhaps later the philanthropic community as well. This is a very important part of my work and my principles and my identity. I really feel that the investment business, broadly speaking, is a very good business. No matter what kind of outsider you are. It's as much a **meritocracy** as I can imagine. I mean, I could be a green Martian with two horns on my head. But if I deliver investment returns, there will be a line of people outside the door who want to buy my product, right? So I think it's a very **meritocratic** industry, and I just hope that places like **Surgo** and the platforms you're running here are ways to add value for more people in this industry, because I really think it's a fantastic place for people who are **intellectually curious**, all kinds of people who can come and be useful to the world.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 嗯，您确实拥有多种特质，因为您对许多不同的事物感兴趣。您写过文章。您写过一本书。您参与过一部戏剧。所有这些如何融入您的**创造力**和**好奇心**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Well, you really have many qualities because you're interested in so many different things. You've written. You've written a book. You've been involved in a play. How does all this work into your **creativity** and **curiosity**?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为……嗯，先告诉我您的一些事情，因为您做了很多有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think... well, first tell me about some of your things, because you do a lot of funky things.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 除了专业工作，我主要做两件事。一件是**慈善事业**，另一件是**创意工作**，我可以先和您谈谈后者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I do two main things besides professional work. One is **philanthropy**, and the other is **creative work**, which I can talk about with you first.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 所以在**慈善**方面，我起步很早。从在**Lone Pine**的第一年开始，我就觉得回馈社会非常重要，就像我作为一名投资者所做的那样，这实际上是关于支持非常优秀的**社会企业家**，并看看我们能否及早发现他们。所以我非常幸运地遇到了**Paul Farmer**，他当时正处于创建**Partners in Health**的早期阶段。不幸的是，他去世了。但他对我来说是一位非常好的导师，他说，他总是说：“公共卫生就像武装抢劫，而不是帮助一位老太太过马路。”你必须打破一些东西才能建立一些东西，它确实是这样的，而且在打破**孤立思维**以真正将解决方案带给人们方面，还有很多工作要做。例如，在印度的一个农村妇产诊所。我从像他这样的人，像**Atul Gawande**这样的人，以及我合作过的其他人那里学到了这些，所有这些都归功于当时在**盖茨基金会**（Gates Foundation）工作的**Samaj Gear**，我创立了**Surgo Health**，这已经是十多年前的事了，我们的观点很大程度上是关于我们如何改善**医疗保健服务交付**，并真正通过有针对性的**数据集**提供帮助。不仅仅是数据和数据集，而是**行为数据**。所以我认为**AI**中可能发生的最有趣的事情之一就是将“为什么”加入到**AI**中。**AI**非常擅长解决**Nikolai**接下来会点击哪个广告的问题，但不能解决“为什么”的问题？我认为添加这种大规模的**行为数据**，您可以使用一些相当基本的**贝叶斯网络数学**来做到这一点，以解释为什么一位女性不去妇产诊所分娩？或者为什么这个社区的XYZ没有使用避孕措施？这是我们投入大量时间的事情。将数据视为**公共产品**，将**数据科学**视为**公共产品**，这是我们投入大量时间的事情。所以这是**慈善工作**的重要组成部分，我们与**比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会**（Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation）等团体以及地方政府合作提供帮助。一个有趣的事情是，我们在印度做了大量关于**孕产妇死亡率**的工作，以帮助针对**北方邦**，该邦每年仅在妇产诊所的采用上就花费10亿美元，并且还在增加。然后我们开始接到来自美国的电话。那里的**孕产妇死亡率**正在上升。这是一个真正的问题。我们如何在美国使用同样的技术？然后与**优步**（Uber）以及联系过的**Dara**（Dara Khosrowshahi）开始了一个真正的项目。我想您采访过他，为母亲们提供乘车服务。问题不在于制定妇产计划并确保女性真正去诊所。在这种情况下，**交通**实际上才是最有趣的事情。是交通，而不是医院护理。所以理解“为什么”非常重要。所以我就此打住。但我认为这是一个非常重要的一面，技术和慈善事业在这里交汇。关于**创意工作**真正有趣的是，我认为我们人类在不考虑自己的时候最快乐。无论是专业工作、慈善工作还是创意工作，这就是为什么我很高兴地做所有这些，从大学时代起，我的意思是，写短篇小说，我认为最终一切都是一个故事，对吗？而且我们最近和一群非常不同类型的非常成功的人共进晚餐，而且……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So on the **philanthropy** front, I started very early. So from the first year at **Lone Pine**, I felt that giving back was very important, and as I do as an investor, it was really about supporting very good **social entrepreneurs** and seeing if we could see them and see them early. So I was very lucky to meet **Paul Farmer**, who was in the early stages of building **Partners in Health** at the time. Sadly, he passed away. But he was a very good mentor to me, and he said, he always said, 'Public health is like armed robbery, rather than helping an old lady cross the street.' You have to break things to build things, and it really is like that, and there's a lot that needs to be done in terms of breaking **siloed thinking** to really get solutions to people. For example, in a rural maternity clinic in India. I learned this from people like him, people like **Atul Gawande**, and others I've worked with, and this all happened because of **Samaj Gear**, who was working at the **Gates Foundation** at the time, and I started **Surgo Health**, and this was more than a decade ago now, and our perspective was very much about how we can improve **healthcare service delivery** and really help with targeted **data sets**. Not just data and data sets, but **behavioral data**. So I think one of the most interesting things potentially happening in **AI** is adding 'why' to **AI**. **AI** is very good at solving the question of which ad **Nikolai** will click next, but not why? And I think adding this large-scale **behavioral data**, which you can do using some fairly basic **Bayesian networking math**, to explain why a woman is not going to a maternity clinic for delivery, or why XYZ in this community is not using contraception. This is something we spend a lot of time on. And seeing data as a **public good** and **data science** as a **public good** is something we spend a lot of time on. So this is a big part of the **philanthropic effort**, and we work with groups like the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation** and others, and local governments to help. And one interesting thing is we did a lot of work on **maternal mortality** in India to help target the state of **Uttar Pradesh**, which is spending a billion dollars every year just on maternity clinic adoption and increasing it. And then we started getting calls from people in the US. **Maternal mortality** is increasing here. This is a real problem. How can we use the same techniques in the US? And then a real program started with **Uber**, with **Dara**, who reached out. I think you interviewed him, to provide rides for moms. The problem wasn't creating maternity plans and making sure women actually went to clinics. In that case, **transportation** was actually the interesting thing. It was transport, not hospital care. So understanding 'why' is very important. So I'll stop here. But I think this is a very important side where technology and philanthropy both meet. The really interesting thing about **creative work** is that I think we humans are happiest when we don't think about ourselves. Whether it's professional work, philanthropic work, or **creative work**, and that's why I do all this happily, since college, I mean, writing short stories, and I think ultimately everything is a story, right? And we recently had dinner with a group of very successful people of very different kinds, and...

</details>

**Nikolai**: 嗯，您让他们做预测。您的晚餐很有趣。[笑声]

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Well, you asked them to make predictions. You have fun dinners. [laughter]

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们让他们做预测。他们都做出了相当悲观的预测。所以这是**叙事自我**和我如何看待自己与**社会自我**和社会背景之间的冲突，这就是为什么我认为**冲突**是我喜欢写作和思考的东西，而且这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: And we asked them to make predictions. All of them made quite pessimistic predictions. So this is a conflict between the **narrative self** and how I see myself versus the **social self** and social context, and that's why I think **conflict** is something I like to write and think about, and it's been really fun.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 给我讲讲那个**剧场项目**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Tell me about the **theater project**.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，所以那个**剧场项目**，“**心灵剧场**”（Theater of the Mind），实际上是基于一系列**神经科学实验**。我对我们谈论的那些经济游戏周围发生的事情非常感兴趣，在**Kahneman**、**Thaler**和**Tversky**的作品中。例如，有一种游戏叫做**独裁者游戏**（Dictator Game），即使游戏组中的一个人可以拿走桌上所有的硬币，人们仍然不会这样做。他们想要分享，这就是希望所在，我对此很感兴趣，我想把它带到伦敦**科学博物馆**的地下室，那是世界上最伟大的博物馆之一。但我的朋友**Brian Eno**说：“不，这里面还有更多。”他把我介绍给了**David Byrne**，他正在思考一个不同背景下的实验，更多地是玩弄**感官本体感受**（sensory proprioception），并理解你如何能够居住在一个玩偶的身体里。这项工作是由瑞典实验室**Ersson Labs**完成的。当我们见面时，我们想：“好吧，这实际上是别的东西，它是一个戏剧作品。”它有一个故事。这是一个男人倒着生活，用这些实验性方面处理记忆的故事。它在丹佛非常成功，现在正前往芝加哥的**古德曼剧院**（Goodman Theatre）。所以这也真的很有趣。所以这实际上是关于以新的和新鲜的方式思考，并确保它转化为更具创造性、更少孤立的思维。您如何将所有这些带回到投资中？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes, so the **theater project**, '**Theater of the Mind**,' was actually based on a series of **neuroscience experiments**. I was very interested in what was happening around some of those economic games we talk about, in the work of **Kahneman**, **Thaler**, and **Tversky**. For example, there's a game called the **Dictator Game**, where even if a person in the playing group can take all the coins on the table, people still don't do that. They want to share, and that's the hopeful thing, and I was interested in this, and I wanted to take it to the basement of the **Science Museum** in London, which is one of the great museums of the world. But my friend **Brian Eno** said, 'No, there's something more to this.' He introduced me to **David Byrne**, who was thinking about an experiment in a different context, playing more with **sensory proprioception** and understanding how you can inhabit the body of a doll. This work was done by a Swedish lab, **Ersson Labs**. And when we met, we thought, 'Okay, this is actually something else, which is a theater piece.' It has a story. It's the story of a man living his life backward and dealing with memories with these experimental aspects. It was very successful in Denver and is now going to the **Goodman Theatre** in Chicago. So this has also been really fun. So it's really about thinking in new and fresh ways and making sure that it turns into more creative, less siloed thinking. How do you bring all this back to investing?

</details>

### 投资、好奇心与谦逊

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为所有这些都回到了这样一个想法：一切在某些方面都只是**叙事**，而实际上是思考**背景**，以及它与戏剧中不同角色相比有多么强大，以及它们如何协同工作。实际上是思考这一个完整的**系统性过程**。我认为这是所有这些的共同点。第二是**好奇心**。我认为在所有这些努力中，**好奇心**是最重要的。无论是为了社会服务解决一个问题，寻找一个伟大的投资并尽可能地理解它，还是做好的、非常好的**创意工作**。我认为第二个品质是**开放性**。写作是**谦逊**的一个很好的练习。与我其他的工作不同，没有人真正关心我是否再写一个短篇故事。世界上有许多这样的故事。但要真正让人们关心，你必须反复修改。什么是修改？就是尽可能地做到最好。这意味着对可能性保持**开放**，对更好保持**开放**。我认为，要警惕**确定性**。我认为这可能是所有这些的另一个共同点。那个100%确定X或Y或Z正在发生的人，对我来说总是一个**危险信号**。它从来没有那么确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think it all goes back to this idea of how everything is just **narrative** in some ways, and actually thinking about **context** and how powerful it is compared to the different characters in a play, and how they all work together. Actually thinking about this one entire **systemic process**. I think that's the common point in all of them. The second is **curiosity**. I think **curiosity** is the most important thing in each of these endeavors. Whether it's solving a problem for social service, finding a great investment and understanding it as much as possible, or doing good, very good **creative work**. I think the second quality is **openness**. Writing is a good exercise in **humility**. Unlike my other work, no one really cares if I write another short story or not. There are many such stories in the world. But to really make people care, you have to revise again and again. What is revision? It's making it as good as possible. It means openness to possibilities and openness to better. And I think, beware of **certainty**. I think that's perhaps another common thread in all of this. The person who is 100% sure that X or Y or Z is happening, that's always a **red flag** for me. It's never that certain.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 保持**好奇心**和**谦逊**的秘诀是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: What's the secret to staying **curious** and **humble**?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为这是一个非常，这是一个很好的循环，对吗？因为如果您从一开始就**好奇**和**谦逊**，您就会学习，您会看到还有多少东西要学习，这会让您保持**谦逊**。然后您，但您也会对那里存在的可能性感到兴奋。所以我认为这只是一个很好的循环。一开始就踏上那个轮子，而且我认为这也更有趣，对吗？有什么比学习更有趣的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think it's a very, it's a good cycle, right? Because if you're **curious** and **humble** from the beginning, you learn, and you see how much more there is to learn, and that keeps you **humble**. And then you, but you're also excited by the possibilities out there. So I think it's just a good cycle. Getting on that wheel at the beginning, and I think it's more fun too, right? What's more fun than learning?

**Nikolai**: 您什么时候起床？

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您读些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: What do you read?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我通常读报纸。我通常只是花时间思考。然后有时我喜欢散一会儿步，然后我读所有的报纸。正常的事情，然后我直接投入工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I usually read newspapers. I usually just spend time thinking. And then sometimes I like to take a short walk, and then I read all the newspapers. Normal things, and then I get straight to work.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您是如何思考的？您只是坐着思考吗？

**Nikolai**: How do you think? Do you just sit and think?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 通常是边走边想，四处走动。

**Mala Gaonkar**: Usually while walking, moving around.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您会构建您的想法，还是只是看着狗、树和事物？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: Do you structure your thoughts, or do you just look at dogs and trees and things?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 不。我一天中的其他时间有很多**结构化思维**。所以在那段时间，我只是让我的思绪自由漫游，看看会想到什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: No. I have a lot of **structured thinking** in the rest of my day. So at that time of day, I just let my mind wander and see what comes up.

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您如何放松？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nikolai**: How do you relax?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我通过与我爱的人共度时光来放松。我的朋友，我的家人，阅读，长途徒步。所以这些都是常见的方式。我认为我们很多人都用它们来断开连接，与大自然在一起，与朋友和家人在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I relax by spending time with the people I love. My friends, my family, reading, going for long hikes. So these are common ways. I think many of us use them to disconnect, to be with nature, and to be with friends and family.
