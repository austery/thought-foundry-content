### 创业公司失败：被忽视的常态

欢迎收听Odd Lots播客的又一期节目。我是Jill Weisenthal。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Jill Weisenthal</p>
</details>

我是Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

Tracy，我们总是听到关于创业公司成功退出的故事，比如人们成为亿万富翁、公司被收购、**IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股）等等。但我认为那并不是大多数创业公司的结局，我们谈论的只是那些成功的案例。你从不听说其他成百上千家失败的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, we always hear about big startup exits. you know, people becoming billionaires, companies getting acquired, going IPO, etc. But I don't think that's most of them is not that. That's just the ones we talk about. You never hear about the scores of other ones that always fail.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 不，这叫做**幸存者偏差**（survival bias: 指人们往往只关注“幸存”下来的事物，从而忽略了那些未能幸存的事物），对吧？所以你只听说赢家，因为所有输家基本上都消失了，无法再发声。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, this is called survival bias, right? So, you only ever hear about the winners because all the losers are basically gone and can no longer uh communicate.</p>
</details>

没错。另外一点是，大多数创业公司都会失败。**VCs**（Venture Capitalists: 风险投资家）会说：“哦，我需要一个赢家来弥补每百个，也许是20个输家。”可能有一些公司能获得两三倍的回报，但这并不是带来巨额财富的。但很有趣，因为输家才是常态，是任何一系列投资的预期结果。是的，我们确实应该更频繁地谈论输家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And then the other thing is that most startups fail and you know VCs talk about oh I need one winner for every you know whatever hundred maybe 20 losers or whatever they're probably few in the middle they get two or three x returns but that's not what delivers the big money but yeah it's funny because it's the losers that's the norm that's the expectation going in with any series of investments and yeah we really should talk about losers more often.</p>
</details>

Jill: 是的，我对此很感兴趣。我们来谈谈输家。我还要说一件事，当我们谈论很多创业公司投资，尤其是在科技领域时，你不会真的认为它们拥有可以出售的资产，或者很多资产。所以，当一家纸箱制造商破产时，可能有一些设备可以出售，有土地，也许有建筑物可以重新利用，一些知识产权。但对于很多科技公司来说，如果它们不成功，似乎什么都没有留下，然后就好像“好吧，直接拔掉插头，大家继续前进”。但我不知道实际情况是否如此，我不知道在公司“死亡”的那一刻究竟会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah I'm into it. Let's talk about losers. I'll say one other thing too which is that when we talk about a lot of startup investing particularly in technology you know you don't really think of them as having assets or a lot of assets that can be sold right so when a sort of cardboard box manufacturer goes bankrupt or whatever well there's probably some equipment that can be sold there's land maybe there's a building that could be reproposed some intellectual property maybe I don't know for some of these with a lot of tech companies it seems like there's nothing there if they don't succeed and then there's like all right you just pull the plug and everybody moves on but I don't really know if that's the case like I don't actually know what happens at that moment of death</p>
</details>

Tracy: 嗯，据我所知，破产往往在很多方面都相当复杂。我回想起一个极端的例子，雷曼兄弟的破产案花了14年才解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well from what I remember bankruptcy tends to be uh pretty complicated in in various ways and I'm thinking back this is the ultimate extreme example but the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that took 14 years</p>
</details>

Jill: 我记得我报道了它好几年。他们有很多交易对手，一个庞大的债权人瀑布流等等。我不知道对于规模较小的风投公司来说，情况会是怎样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I remember covering it for like years and years and years and years and they had all these counter parties, this big waterfall of creditors and things like that. And I wonder how it works for I guess smaller VC companies.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 完全正确。而且似乎那种法庭体验是你可能想尽量避免的。所以，我们确实请到了最合适的嘉宾来谈谈公司失败时会发生什么，创业公司失败时会发生什么。我们正在与David Johnson对话。他是Resolution Financial Advisors的执行合伙人。这是一家总部位于洛杉矶的金融咨询公司，专门从事破产事务。所以，我们将了解所有这些。David，非常感谢你来参加播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And it seems like that whole court experience is probably something you might want to avoid if you can. So anyway, we really do have the perfect guest to talk about what happens when a company fails, what happens when the startup fails. We are talking with David Johnson. He is a managing principal at Resolution Financial Advisors. They're a financial advisory firm based out of Los Angeles that focuses exclusively on the insolveny world. So, we're going to learn about all of this. David, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 谢谢你们，Joe和Tracy。我很高兴能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you, Joe and Tracy. I'm delighted to be here.</p>
</details>

Jill: 这会很有趣。你能不能先介绍一下，你或者Resolution Financial Advisors是做什么的？你们典型的客户是什么样的，他们在寻求什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is going to be a lot of fun. Why don't you start off? What do you do or what does Resolution Financial Advisors do? What is your sort of typical client and what are they looking for?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: Resolution Financial Advisors是一家金融咨询公司，这是真的，但我们不做很多其他金融咨询公司做的工作。我很久以前在Alvarez and Marcel开始我的职业生涯。我想我是他们第21号员工，现在那是一家拥有10,000名员工的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Resolution Financial Advisors is a financial advisory firm. It's true, but we don't do a lot of the work that other financial advisories firms do. I started my career at Alvarez and Marcel a long time ago. I think I was employee number 21 of what is now a 10,000 person firm.</p>
</details>

Jill: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 我在那里做了重组工作、临时管理工作和法务会计工作。所以，我在职业生涯中做了很多那方面的工作，但我们现在不再做那些了。我们像激光束一样专注于我所说的“破产世界”，也就是破产的替代方案和其他清算公司的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I did restructuring work and interim management work and forensic accounting work there. So, I've done a lot of that in my career, but that's not what we do anymore. We focus like a laser beam on what I call the insolveny world. that is alternatives to bankruptcy and other ways to wind down companies</p>
</details>

我们通过回收价值来创造价值，有时我们确实会使用破产法。我是一名破产专家，一名特许金融分析师（CFA），也是一名认证破产和重组顾问。因此，在某些情况下，破产是正确的工具，但对于大多数与我合作的人来说，它并不是正确的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">create value by recovering value and sometimes we do use the bankruptcy code. I am a bankruptcy specialist. I'm a chartered financial analyst and I am a certified insolveny and restructuring adviser and so bankruptcy is the right tool in some cases but for most of the people with whom I do work it's not the right solution. So, why don't we talk about the various solutions that are potentially on the table? Because I think a lot of people will recognize something like chapter 11 bankruptcy. I know as the daughter of a commercial airline pilot, I am certainly familiar with chapter 11 bankruptcy and that allows you to, you know, keep operating, keep the business going while you sort out your various creditors. And then there's chapter 7, which is an actual liquidation. And then there's, I assume, more creative workouts that you are advising on. What are the options?</p>
</details>

Tracy: 那么，我们来谈谈可能存在的各种解决方案吧？因为我认为很多人会认识到像**美国破产法第11章**（Chapter 11 bankruptcy: 允许公司在重组债务的同时继续运营）这样的东西。我知道作为一名商业航空公司飞行员的女儿，我当然熟悉美国破产法第11章，它允许你在处理各种债权人的同时，继续运营业务。然后是**美国破产法第7章**（Chapter 7 bankruptcy: 涉及公司资产的清算），这是一种实际的清算。我想，还有更多你正在提供咨询的创新重组方案。有哪些选择呢？

And then there's chapter 7, which is an actual liquidation. And then there's, I assume, more creative workouts that you are advising on. What are the options?</p>
</details>

### 破产清算：传统路径与替代方案

David Johnson: Tracy，这是一个非常好的总结，谢谢。是的，第11章是重组。在那里，你可以获得**自动中止**（automatic stay: 法律程序暂停，以保护债务人免受债权人追索），暂停债权人的追索，并有机会喘息，以优惠条件筹集新资金，并在一个非常严格的法院监督程序下进行资产出售。它有其存在的价值。我经历过很多这样的案例。如果你想重组一家公司，它们非常有效。许多通过破产购买资产的买家会更喜欢通过法官的命令来完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a really good summary, Tracy. Thank you. Yes. Chapter 11 is the restructuring. That's where you get a an automatic stay, a pause from your creditors, and a chance to catch your breath, raise new money under favorable terms, conduct a sale of the assets in a very, very court supervised process. Has its place. I've been through many of those. They are terrific if you want to restructure a company. Many buyers buying assets out of bankruptcy will prefer a judge's order to do it that way.</p>
</details>

正如你所说，第7章是你把钥匙扔在桌上然后走开的时候。破产法院会任命一名独立的律师，他们被称为**破产受托人**（bankruptcy trustee: 负责管理和清算破产财产的独立第三方），但他们往往不是销售**异类资产**（esoteric assets: 具有独特或不寻常特征，难以估价和出售的资产）的专家。你通常不指望在第7章中能回收任何价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chapter seven, as you said, is when you throw the keys on the table and walk away. And bankruptcy court will appoint a independent attorney, a bankruptcy trustee, they're called, but they tend to be people who are not specialists at selling esoteric assets. You don't really expect any value recovery in a chapter 7.</p>
</details>

所以我们专注于提供替代方案，让公司拥有更多的控制权，并且当然不会让他们承担那么多成本。例如，要进入第11章破产程序，你几乎肯定需要至少10万到20万美元，仅仅是作为给破产律师的预付金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we do is we specialize in alternatives that give the company a little bit more control and certainly don't ask them to incur so many costs. For example, to get into a chapter 11 bankruptcy, you almost certainly need upwards of a hundred or $200,000 just to give a retainer to your bankruptcy council.</p>
</details>

Jill: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 有时这是有必要的，但对于我们今天将要讨论的公司来说，这不是明智的资金使用方式，特别是当你没有预期的销售或重组结果时。你只是想关闭公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes that's warranted, but for the companies we'll be talking about today, it's not a wise use of money, especially when you don't have an expected outcome where there will be a sale or a restructuring. You simply want to shut down.</p>
</details>

Jill: 我有一个非常简短的问题，然后是一个真正的问题。我从未听说过像美国破产法第6章这样的东西。它存在吗？或者其他章节是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have one really short question then a real question. Like I've never heard of like a chapter 6 bankruptcy. Does that exist or what's up with all those other chapters?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 还有其他破产章节。有些是专门针对农民的，例如。还有一些是处理在美国的国际公司的。但你最常听到的是第11章、第7章，以及**美国破产法第13章**（Chapter 13 bankruptcy: 允许有稳定收入的个人在一定时期内偿还债务，同时保留资产）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are other bankruptcies. There are some especially for farmers for example. There are some that deal with international companies in the United States. But chapter 11, chapter 7, and then chapter 13 are the ones you hear about most of the time.</p>
</details>

Jill: 明白了。好的。这只是我一直想问的一个问题。我可能问**Perplexity**（Perplexity: 一款基于AI的问答搜索引擎）也能得到一个不错的答案，但现在我已经解决了。你提到了异类资产。所以我想象有些类型的资产对任何人来说都非常容易出售，比如一栋建筑物或类似的东西。办公室之类的并不复杂。那么，什么是异类资产？如果你不是这方面的专家，你可能真的不知道如何从中获得最高价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got it. Okay. That was just one of those questions I've been dying to get off my chest. I probably could have asked Chad GPT that and got a decent answer, but now I got that out of the way. You mentioned esoteric assets. So I imagine that there are some types of assets that are very easy for anyone to sell like a building or something. It's not very complicated offices whatever and then what is an esoteric asset for which if you're not a specialist in it you might really not know how to get top value for it.</p>
</details>

### 异类资产的挑战与价值最大化

David Johnson: 所以我在新经济领域做了很多工作。过去20年大部分时间我都在与硅谷公司合作，这些公司有科技初创企业、生物制药、清洁能源等，这些都非常**知识产权密集型**（intellectual property-heavy: 指公司资产主要由专利、商标、版权等无形资产构成）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I do a lot of work in the new economy. I've spent most of the past 20 years working with Silicon Valley firms who have tech startups biioarma clean energy things that are very intellectual propertyheavy.</p>
</details>

有时，在出售公司资产时，我们会有机械设备、库存或其他可以轻易拍卖的东西。但如果你拥有特定技术的**专利组合**（patent portfolio: 公司拥有的所有专利的集合），或者你正在开发一种药物，或者你拥有独特的特殊软件，那么就没有基准可循。没有公开叫价的拍卖系统可以进行。你真的必须找到合适的、有针对性的买家，并努力将这些资产变现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is sometimes the case that in selling a company's assets, we have machinery and equipment or inventory or something that could easily be auctioned. But if you have a patent portfolio for a specific technology or if you've got a drug in development or you've got a special software that does something unique, there's no benchmark for that. There's no open outcry auction system that you can conduct for that. You've really got to find the right buyers narrowly tailored and conduct an effort to monetize those assets.</p>
</details>

Jill: 好的，我想谈谈那些失败者，因为我坚信，你知道，你总是读那些商业书籍，它们会说“这是一家巨大的成功公司”，但没有人写那些没有成功的公司，就像你一开始提到的那样，Joe。所以，我很好奇，在你这么多年的工作中，你是否观察到失败公司之间有什么共同点？是否存在某种普遍存在于所有失败中的特质？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I want to talk about the losers because I am a firm believer, you know, you always read all those business books that are like here's this massive company that was a huge success story and no one ever writes about the ones that didn't make it as you mentioned at the beginning, Joe. So, one thing I'm wondering in your many many years of doing this, have you observed like a commonality among companies that fail? Is there something that is I guess endemic to all the failures?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 我不会这么说。那些投资这些公司的人拥有更多的信息，可能也比我聪明得多。大约一年前，有一本新书叫做《风险投资心态》（The Venture Mindset），它指出硅谷的风险投资公司并不介意亏钱。他们不介意投资那些不会成功的项目。他们更担心的是错过那些成功的项目，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wouldn't say so. The people that are doing the investing in those companies have a lot more information and probably are a lot more intelligent than I am. There was a recent book out a year or so ago called the venture mindset and it makes the point that Silicon Valley venture firms don't really mind losing money. They don't mind investing in something that won't succeed. They're much more concerned about missing the ones that do succeed. right?</p>
</details>

他们知道十个投资中，八个甚至更多会持平或完全失败，但我的数字是十个中八个。是另外两个或十个中那一个会支撑基金一年的收益。所以他们撒下大网。当然，他们尽力进行明智的选择，但他们撒下大网，其中大多数都需要被关闭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They know that eight out of 10, perhaps more, but my number is eight out of 10 investments will either break even or fail completely. It's the other two or the other one out of that 10 that will carry the fund for the year. So, they cast a wide net. They do their best to pick intelligently, of course, but they cast a wide net and most of them need to be shut down.</p>
</details>

Jill: 那么，从多年亏损到实际破产和失败的触发点或催化剂是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, what's the trigger or the catalyst from going to losing money for years and years and years to an actual bankruptcy and failure?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 好问题。那就是他们来找我的时候。公司来找我的时候，它们可能处于**未产生收入**（pre-revenue: 尚未开始销售产品或服务，没有营收）阶段。它们几乎总是**未盈利**（pre-profitability: 尚未实现盈利）的。它们可能依赖下一批风险投资的资金注入。如果他们的计划是烧掉一定数量的钱，并且风险投资伙伴会继续为他们提供资金，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good question. That's when they come to me. The companies come to me when they're perhaps pre-revenue. They're almost always pre-p profofitability. They are relying probably on the next trunch of venture funding to come in. If their plan says we're going to burn a certain amount of money and the venture partners are going to continue to fund us,</p>
</details>

最终，风险投资基金会失去耐心，基金已经满期或过时，或者他们根本不再相信这个想法。这是第一件事。如果这笔钱没有进来，你就无法支付工资，无法运营。或者他们可能有一个**有担保债权人**（secured lender: 拥有抵押品作为贷款担保的债权人），比如硅谷银行。我与他们合作。他们做了很多风险投资。银行可能会失去耐心。银行可能不得不减记贷款。银行可能想要收回他们的债务。好的？他们可能会切断信用额度，或者根本不再向他们提供任何资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">eventually the venture fund runs out of patience, the fund is is full or old, or they simply don't believe in the idea anymore. That's the first thing. If that money doesn't come in, you can't make payroll, you can't operate. Or perhaps they've got a secured lender like Silicon Valley Bank. I do work with them. They do a lot of venture investing. The bank may run out of patience. The bank may have to write down the loan. The bank may want to recover their debt. Okay? And they'll cut off their line of credit perhaps or simply fail to advance them any more money.</p>
</details>

或者风险投资公司可能已经尝试出售公司，尝试出售技术，他们已经进行了投资银行流程，但没有买家出现。那么，当你走到尽头时该怎么办？没有更多的现金来支付工资。你无法继续为公司提供资金。你该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or perhaps the venture firm has tried to sell the company, tried to sell the technology, they've run an investment banking process and no buyer has emerged. So what do you do when you come to the end of the road? There's no more cash to pay payroll. You can't continue funding your company. What do you do?</p>
</details>

Jill: 好的。所以他们来找你，正如你所说，至少在某些情况下，会有这些异类资产，而典型的法院任命清算人没有专业知识来为它们获得最高价值。顺便说一句，我想象在某些情况下你没有专业知识，但你必须学习它，或者你必须专注于它。所以，假设我正在做一些新颖的事情，比如药物发现或其他什么，你可以给我们举个例子，某种新型资产来到你面前，你的工作是获得最高价值，你还没有真正处理过，你还不了解这个具体的东西，也许因为它很新颖。给我们举一个异类资产的例子，以及你是如何寻找买家，让他们能够支付最高价值的。你知道，Paul McCartney曾说过他很幸运，因为在他的工作中，他不需要知道如何读乐谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, they come to you and as you said, there are going to be these esoteric assets in at least some cases for which a typical courtappointed liquidator does not have the specialty to get the max dollar for them. Incidentally, I imagine there are situations in which you don't have the specialty, but you have to learn it or you have to focus on that. So let's say I'm doing something novel and I don't drug discovery or whatever it is you can give us the example some new type of asset comes to you your job is to get Maxeller you haven't really dealt you don't know this specific thing yet maybe because it's novel give us an example of some esoteric asset and how you sought out to find the buyer who was able to pay max dollar you know Paul McCartney once said that he was fortunate because in his line of work he did not need to know how to read music.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah,</p>
</details>

我处理的是广泛的技术。正如我所说，清洁技术、生物制药和软件、AI，所有这些我一无所知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I deal in broad-based technology. I'm, as I said, clean techch and biioarma and software and AI, all of which I know nothing about.</p>
</details>

我不需要成为技术的专家。我需要知道如何找到了解技术的人。所以，我想把这些资产呈现在合适的人面前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't need to be a specialist in the technology. I need to know how to find the people that know it. So, I want to put those assets in front of the right people.</p>
</details>

我运行我称之为“迷你投资银行流程”的东西。我们必须快速完成。我们没有多少钱。公司里的人很快就会离开。所以，我不会做六个月，我做八周。我总结技术，把它打包成一个小文件，然后把它呈现在那个非常狭窄的、有针对性的领域中的50到100家公司面前，无论那个领域是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I run what I call a mini investment banking process. We have to do it quickly. We don't have much money. The people that are at the company are going to be gone very, very soon. So, I don't do it for six months. I do it for eight weeks. I sum up the technology. I put it into a little package and I put it in front of the 50 to 100 companies in that very narrowly targeted space, whatever that space happens to be.</p>
</details>

Jill: 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 我要确保该行业中的每个人都有机会查看并发表意见。我不需要学习它。我需要了解足够多的信息才能谈论它，但我的职责是把人们带到谈判桌前。我想把他们呈现在发明这项技术的人面前，那些能告诉大家为什么这项技术最棒的人面前，然后让市场告诉我它的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to make sure that everybody in that respective industry has a chance to look at it and opine. I don't have to learn it. I have to know enough to talk about it a little bit, but I'm there to bring people to the table. I want to put them in front of the people who invented the technology, the people who can tell everybody why it's the greatest thing. and let the market tell me what it is.</p>
</details>

Jill: 那么，给我们举一个技术方面的例子，或者讲一个你必须这样做的故事。

<p class="english-text">So, give us an example of ad technology or give us a story about where you had to do that.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 很久以前，我曾为一家名为Proteiogenics的公司工作。那是在10多年前，所以我可以放心地说出它的名字。他们正在进行新生儿疾病研究。他们收集了——哦，我不知道有多少品脱的阴道液，全部冷冻在他们实验室的地下室里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Long time ago, I worked on a company called Proteiogenics. It was more than 10 years ago, so I feel comfortable releasing the name. They were doing research in neonatal disease. They had collected oh, I don't know how many pints of vaginal fluid all in deep freeze in the basement of their laboratory.</p>
</details>

Jill: 没有能力，阴道液有二级市场吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Didn't have the ability there a secondary market for vaginal fluid?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 嗯，我的工作就是去发现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Well, that was my job to find out.</p>
</details>

Jill: 天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 完全正确。当时有专利，有研究，有医学测试，还有患者记录，所有这些都是为了分析他们正在寻找的疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's exactly right. Now, there were patents and there were research and there were medical tests and there were patient records all analyzing for disease for whatever disease they were looking for.</p>
</details>

我们最终将这项技术出售给了一家大型的，我想是总部位于波士顿的制药公司。我不知道后来发生了什么，但我必须管理这个过程。公司一夜之间关闭了。设施被锁起来，阴道液还在深冷柜里，房东对此很不高兴。所以我的工作有两件事。我的工作总是两件事：第一，将资产变现。在“冰块融化”之前迅速完成。我必须找到买家。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We ultimately did sell that technology to a large I think Boston-based pharmaceutical company. I don't know what ever happened to it from there, but I had to manage that process. The company closed overnight. The facility was locked with the vaginal fluid in the deep freezers and I had a landlord who wasn't very happy about that. So my job was to two things. My job is always two things. Number one, monetize the assets. Do it quickly before the ice cube melts. I had to find a buyer.</p>
</details>

Jill: 你这里说得很形象。就像冰块在融化，这在业界有时是一个老生常谈的比喻，但你谈论的是字面意义上的融化冷藏。继续说。情况变得有点棘手，因为房东把我锁在外面了。房东在加州不应该能那样做，但我最终不得不进行谈判，并保持电力供应，直到我能够进行销售流程，吸引人们的兴趣，备份技术数据，并用冷藏卡车把那些冷柜运走，所有这些都在时间紧迫的情况下进行，我的预算非常有限，要支付租金和电费。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You're being very literal here. Like it's a melting ice cube and this is sometimes a cliche in the world, but you're talking about literal melting refrigeration. Keep going. It got a little dicey because the landlord locked me out. Now, landlords aren't supposed to be able to do that in California, but I wound up having to negotiate something and keeping the lights on until such time as I could run the sale process, get people interested, back up the technical data, and move those freezers out on refrigerated trucks, all while the clock was ticking, while I had a very limited budget to pay the rent and to keep the electricity on.</p>
</details>

现在，那又是一个好结果，因为我们出售了这项技术。如果我没记错的话，大概是200万美元，这在我的业务中是一个很好的结果。这可能足以偿还**有担保债权人**（secured lender: 拥有抵押品作为贷款担保的债权人）。通常有一家银行是第一个获得偿还的。然后是**无担保债权人**（unsecured creditors: 没有抵押品担保的债权人），他们排在第二位，比如贸易债权人、房东等等。所以，我们会尽量争取更多。当时那家公司可能投资了5000万美元，来自各种基金、贷款人和股权投资者，所以我们无法让这些人全部得到偿还，但我们希望能尽可能多地获取价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that was a good outcome again because we sold the technology. I'm thinking, if I remember correctly, maybe $2 million, which is a great outcome in my business. That was probably enough to repay the secured lender. There was often a bank that's first in line to get paid. And then there are unsecured creditors who come second, trade creditors, landlords, things like that. So, we're going to try to to get as much. Now, there was probably $50 million invested in that company from various funds, lenders, equity investors, and so we're not going to get those guys repaid, but we want to source as much value as we can.</p>
</details>

有人会问我：“一项技术值多少钱？”我的回答总是：“我不知道，但我会查清楚。”我怎么查清楚呢？正如我之前所说，我们会与行业内的每个人交谈，每个了解这项技术的人，每个能够说“这可能对我有用”的人，我们会让他们发表意见。有时答案是“没有人”。

<p class="english-text">Somebody will say to me, "How much is a technology worth?" And my answer is always, "I have no idea, but I'm gonna find out." How am I gonna find out?

Sometimes the answer is no one.</p>

David Johnson: 我不记得买家的名字了，但我记得那是一家大型的、总部位于波士顿的生物科技公司，名字很有名。我只记得那是买家。然后我记得的另一件事是，当我们搬走的那天，我们把技术备份到了一个外置硬盘上。他们为此支付了200万美元。当他们准备离开时，却找不到硬盘了。我们在垃圾桶里找到了它。

### 公司倒闭中的人性与激励

Jill: 我想对公司失败这件事变得非常“窥探”，我想，只是想问一堆具体的例子。但是你有没有进入一家公司，然后只是，你知道，厌恶或惊讶地摇头，对正在发生的事情感到震惊？比如，这家公司怎么可能以这种方式运行了这么长时间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm just going to get very um voyeristic about corporate failures, I guess, and just ask for a bunch of specific examples, but have you ever gone into a company and just, you know, shook your head in disgust or surprise at what's been going on? like how could this company actually have been running this way for I don't know however long.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 价值的毁灭如此巨大，这常常让我感到惊讶。如果你告诉我，X公司投资了5000万到1亿美元，但却一无所获，或者这项技术只能以100万或200万美元的价格出售。钱都去哪儿了？这是一个很好的问题，我从事这项工作很长时间了，但我真的没有一个好的答案。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It is often surprising to me that the destruction of value is so great. If you told me $50 to $100 million was invested in X and there's nothing to show for it or maybe the technology has a buyer for a million or $2 million. Where does the money go? That's a very good question and I've been doing this a long time and I I don't really have a good answer for that.</p>
</details>

Jill: 你知道，我好奇的是，当一家公司濒临倒闭时，如果我是一个创始人，或者我是一个董事会成员，或者其他什么，我可能会非常心不在焉。我有点不惊讶，在某些情况下，一些重要的技术，比如在一个硬盘上，等等，被扔进了垃圾桶，或者没有人真正关心继续支付冷藏费用。但是，你知道，如果你参与其中，你可能正在考虑你的下一件事。这已经死了。这是浪费时间。我看不出未来的任何好处。谈谈那些后期阶段，以及谁真正有动力坚持到最后，直到钥匙被交出，直到交易完成。你如何让他们专注于提取最后的价值，而大多数人我想在那时都想继续前进？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, something I'm curious about is will it could if when a company is on its deathbed, if I were a founder or if I were a board member or whatever, like I would be pretty checked out. Like I'm kind of not surprised in some instances that like, you know what, some important bit of technology, it's on a hard drive, etc. gets thrown in the trash or no one really cares about keeping the refrigeration bill going. But, you know, if you're whatever involved in this, like you might be thinking about your next thing. This is dead. This is a waste of time. I see no future upside. Talk about like those late stages and who actually is incentivized to till the very end till the keys are handed over till the sale is made. Like how do you get them focused on extracting that last value when most people I would imagine want to move on at that point?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: Joe，这是一个很好的过渡。那么我们是如何被雇佣的？为什么人们会请我们进来？这完全正确。如果我是一家公司的董事会成员，我可能在一家风险投资公司或私募股权公司，或者可能是一家风险贷款机构。一旦我看到不会有任何回收或只有微不足道的回收，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's an excellent segue, Joe. So how do we get hired? Why do people bring us in? It's exactly right. If I'm on the board of a company, I'm probably residing at a venture capital firm or a private equity firm or maybe a venture lender and once I see that there's not going to be any recovery or minor recovery,</p>
</details>

Jill: 你为什么要再花一秒钟在上面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why would you want to spend another second on it</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 或者再花一美元？完全正确。所以，我宁愿去专注于那些有上升空间的事情。所以，他们希望尽快把它交给我。因此，在我的业务范畴内，我们经常（并非总是）参与一种正式的破产程序，称为**为债权人利益转让**（Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, 简称ABC）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or another dollar? That's exactly right. So, I'd rather go focus on my things with upside. So, they want to as quickly as possible hand it off to me. So, under the rubric of my business, we very often, not always, but very often engage in a formal kind of insolveny process. known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors, okay? Or ABC for short.</p>
</details>

这是一种在许多州都得到认可的破产形式。它不属于联邦破产法，而是加州、特拉华州等州的州法律。它有着悠久的历史，并不是什么新鲜事，可以追溯到英国普通法。在ABC程序下，公司会说：“我们有资产。我们有债务。我们无法继续经营业务。所以，我们将把我们所有的资产转让给第三方受托人。”那个人就是我。我同样有两项工作。第一，将这些资产变现，尽量收集资金并存入一个信托账户供债权人使用。我的第二项职能是进行公司的行政清算。准备最终的纳税申报表。存储账簿和记录。确保W2表格在年底发给员工。根据《雇员退休收入保障法》（Orisa law）妥善清算401k计划。所有这些行政事务都是董事会成员真正关心并且应该关心的，但他们没有专业知识或兴趣自己去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a form of insolveny that's well recognized in many states. It's not under federal bankruptcy law. It's under state law in California, state law in Delaware. Has a long storied history. It's nothing new. Goes back to English common law. Under an ABC, a company says, "We have assets. We have debts. We can't continue to operate the business. So, we're going to take all of our assets and assign them to a third party trustee. That's me. And I have, again, I have two jobs. One, turn those assets into cash, try to collect as much money and put it in a trust account for creditors. And my second function is to do the administrative wind down of the company. Get the final tax returns prepared. Store the books and records. Make sure the W2s go out to the employees at the end of the year. Wind down the 401k under Orisa law properly. All the administrative things that board of members really do care about and should care about but don't have the expertise or the interest to do themselves.</p>
</details>

因此，当交易发生时，当公司将这些资产转让给我时，董事会通常会在同一天辞职。

Jill: 在**特拉华州解散**（Delaware dissolution: 公司在特拉华州注册并根据该州法律进行的解散程序）中，如果公司只是提交文件关闭公司而没有正式的破产程序，特拉华州要求至少一名董事在三年内继续承担董事责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in a Delaware dissolution, if the company's just going to file paperworks to close the company without a formal insolveny process, Delaware requires at least one director stay on the hook as a director for three years,</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 这意味着你必须保持保险到位。你必须继续用可能面临风险的事项来打扰董事。在这种情况下，他们不必这样做。他们把所有的工作都放在我和我的合伙人肩上。我们有法律上的**信托责任**（fiduciary duty: 法律或道德上要求一方为另一方利益行事的责任）来做我们谈论过的事情：将资产变现并清算公司。而且我们经常再也不会与那些董事交谈。

<details>

<p class="english-text">which means you've got to keep, you know, insurance in place. You've got to continue to bother the directors with items he may be at risk. In this case, they don't have to.

And it's very often we never talk to those directors again.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我正在思考如何提出这个问题，但是否有人曾试图影响你作为受托人的决定，你作为受托人应该是独立的，遵循法律的？是否有人曾试图让自己在债权人清偿顺序中提前？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm thinking how to frame this question, but does anyone ever try to influence your decisions as a trustee who is, you know, supposed to be independent following the law? Does anyone ever try to kick themselves up the waterfall or something like that?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 这是一个好问题。我很少遇到那样的情况。我们非常严格地处理破产程序。我们遵守联邦破产法第11章中的许多相同规则。拥有正式的ABC破产程序的表面本身就是强大的。我们告诉我们的公司，如果你只是走开，你欠银行钱，你欠无担保债权人钱，人们会很生气。人们会寻找可以起诉的人。人们可能会推动**非自愿破产**（involuntary bankruptcy: 债权人而非债务人主动向法院申请的破产程序）。你们都不希望发生这些。你们想走开。相反，让Resolution成为目标。给某人一个提交索赔的地方。给他们一个可以发泄的对象。让他们知道有一个程序。并向他们保证你正在独立行事。如果需要分配任何资金，你将获得公平的份额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a good question. I've had very few experiences like that. We handle the insolveny process very strictly. We adhere to a lot of the same rules that occur in chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy. The veneer of having the formal ABC insolveny process is itself powerful. We tell our companies if you just walk away and you owe the bank money and you owe unsecured creditors money, people are going to be angry. People are going to look for somebody to sue. People are going to perhaps push for an involuntary bankruptcy. You guys don't want any of that. You want to walk away. Instead, make resolution the target. Give somebody a place to file a claim. Give them someone to yell at. Let them know there's a process. And give them the assurance that you're acting independently. And if there's any money to distribute, you'll get your fair share.</p>

### 速度与复杂性：破产清算的平衡

Jill: 好的。我想问的另一件事是，我一开始提到了雷曼兄弟的破产案，你知道，它花了十多年才解决，也许是一个极端的例子，但你确实经常听说破产程序持续多年。而在你的业务中，听起来你试图非常迅速地完成清算，对吧？你试图尽可能多地获得资金，也许这意味着你必须非常非常迅速地行动。所以，我很好奇你是如何平衡速度需求与实际清算一家公司的财务和法律复杂性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, the other thing I wanted to ask is I mentioned at the beginning the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which you know took more than a decade to resolve and was perhaps an extreme example, but you do often hear about bankruptcy proceedings that go on for years and years and years. And in your business, it sounds like you're trying to be pretty fast with the windown, right? You're trying to get as much money as possible and maybe that means you have to move really, really quickly. So, I'm curious how you kind of balance the need for speed with the financial and legal complexities of actually winding down a company.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 持续很长时间的破产案之所以如此，是因为有大量的实质性资产需要出售或分割，而且你通常会有一大群债权人。这些债权人可以组成自己的委员会。他们可以聘请自己的律师、自己的财务顾问。存在许多相互竞争的利益。你说得对，雷曼兄弟会是一个极端的例子。那是我的老老板Brian Marcel。我们花了几年时间才完成那个案子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bankruptcies that go on for a long time do so because there are material assets that have to get sold or divvied up and you often have a huge constituency of creditors. Those creditors can form their own committee. They can hire their own counsel, their own financial adviserss. There's many competing interests. You're right. Leman would be an extreme example. That was my old boss, Brian Marcel. We spent years doing that one.</p>
</details>

在我的案例中，你没有那种情况，因为你只有一个资产，或者你拥有的资产价值未知，最多可能只有几百万美元。在大多数通过我的程序处理的案例中，我们谈论的不是数十亿美元。所以，需要管理的东西更少。你没有破产的一些法律好处，但也没有限制。你不必请求法官的许可来做各种事情。你通常不必拥有庞大的财务顾问团队来管理现金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In these cases, you don't have that in my cases because you have a single asset or you have assets that have unknown value and likely several million dollars at most. We're not talking about a billion dollars in most cases that go through my process. So, there's less to manage. You don't have some of the the legal benefits of bankruptcy, but nor do you have the restrictions. You don't have to ask a judge for permission to do all sorts of things. You don't have to usually have a large staff of financial adviserss managing the cash.</p>
</details>

确实，有时在我的程序中，我们继续运营公司的业务，但只使用骨干人员，最多几个月。所以它们远没有那么复杂。结果对于这么多债权人来说也远没有那么严峻。但我会给你一个例子，说明我们曾希望进行ABC程序，但最终却进行了第11章破产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is true that sometimes in my processes we continue to run the operations of the company, but on a skeleton crew and maybe for a few months at most. So they're not nearly as complicated. The outcome is not nearly as fraught for so many creditors. But I will give you one example of when we had hoped to do an ABC but wound up doing a chapter 11 instead. Hm.</p>
</details>

几年前有一家体育公司。他们有一个网站，收集或整理体育文章。我们有一位体育作家只写佛罗里达马林鱼队，还有一位体育作家只写旧金山的这支球队。抱歉，我对体育不太了解。所以，他们有一群人都与这家公司签订了合同。这家公司有网站，而且是一个知名品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a company a few years ago that was in the sports business. They had a website that accumulated or curated sports writing. We had one sports writer who only wrote about the Florida Marlins and one sports writer that only wrote about this team in San Francisco. Sorry, I'm not much of a sports buff. So, they had a collection of people all of whom were contracted with this company. The company had the website and was a well-known brand.</p>
</details>

我们曾希望进行**为债权人利益转让**（Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, ABC），因为我们有1000万美元的债务。我们有一个买家愿意为这些资产支付1000万美元。听起来很匹配。不幸的是，破产中有一些特殊的规则在这里很方便，但在破产程序之外我们无法利用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had hoped to do an assignment for the benefit of creditors because we had $10 million of debt. We had a buyer who wanted to pay $10 million for the assets. Sounded like a great match. Unfortunately, there are special rules in bankruptcy that come in handy here that we can't take advantage of in the outside of the bankruptcy process.</p>
</details>

具体来说，在破产中，如果你有像那样的承包商，如果你有高管合同，你可以把这些合同拖延下去，并把它们纳入对买家的出售中。这些承包商必须在破产法院的配合下接受。在ABC程序中，我没有那种权力。所以我必须与一百或两百名体育作家谈判，让他们同意出售给买家，而这是不可行的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Specifically, in bankruptcy, if you have contractors like that, if you have executive contracts, you can drag those contracts along and put them in a sale to a buyer. And those contractors have to go along with that along with a bankruptcy court. In an ABC, I don't have that power. So I would have had to negotiate with a hundred or 200 sports writers to get them to go along with the sale to the buyer and that was not</p>

Jill: 可行的。

David Johnson: 因此，我们提交了第11章破产申请。我们通过第11章363条款的销售程序完成了与买家的销售，销售得以完成。现在，不利的一面是。我们有1000万美元的贷款。我们有一个1000万美元的买家。

</details>

等到破产程序支付完毕，包括破产律师费、我们公司费用、债权人委员会及其律师和财务顾问的费用，以及延误、特殊保险和必须预留的资金，买家确实支付了1000万美元。但贷款人最终只拿到了700万美元。

### 案例研究：从生物科技到共享滑板车

Jill: 等等，等等。他们用那些人头做什么？

<p class="english-text">Wait, wait. What do they do with the heads?</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我本来不想问那个问题。

<p class="english-text">I wasn't going to ask that question.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 哦，好的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Oh, okay.</p>

抱歉，我没有更多故事了，但我们找到了人把它们带走了。

<p class="english-text">I'm sorry. I don't have more to the story, but we uh we found somebody to take them off.</p>

我的工作是把人头处理掉，然后继续生活。

<p class="english-text">My job was to get the human heads off and then move on with life.</p>

Jill: 你的工作完成了。

David Johnson: 我把世界分为两个部分：我的问题和不是我的问题。我发现那样会更快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I divide the world into two sections. things that are my problem, things that are not my problem. And I find that I'm much happier that way.</p>
</details>

Jill: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 但我确实有一次处理过核废料。那是一家核医学公司，不是一桶桶发光的棒子，而是你可以拿在手里的东西，但仍然需要妥善处理。再一次，这些都是那些签署成为董事的人不想花时间解决的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I did have nuclear waste one time. There was a a nuclear medicine company, not buckets of glowing rods, but you know, something you could hold in your hand, but still it needed to be disposed of properly. Once again, these are things that people who signed up to be a director don't want to spend their time solving.</p>
</details>

Jill: 我正要问，你卖过的最奇怪的东西是什么，但我猜，你知道，人头和核废料会排在前列。所以也许我换个问题。你提出过的最具创意的买家解决方案是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was about to ask, what's the weirdest thing you ever had to sell, but I'm assuming, you know, human heads would be up there along with nuclear waste. So maybe I'll ask instead. What's the most creative buyer solution that you have come up with?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 嗯，那我再讲一个故事。我不想提名字，因为它涉及一家财富500强公司，但我会告诉你足够有趣的部分。大约一年半前，我接到一个律师的电话，他在纽约给我介绍业务。实际上，他们说：“我的客户遇到了灾难。他们需要立即与你通话。”我与董事会通了电话。我们刚刚发现首席执行官一直在对我们撒谎，我们现金告罄，无法支付工资，我们必须立即关闭。好的，所以我们介入接管了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let me tell another story then. And I I don't want to mention the name because it was a Fortune 500 company that was involved, but I'll tell you enough to be interesting. I got a call about a year and a half ago from an attorney who sends me business here in New York. Actually, they said, "My client has a disaster. They need to talk to you right away." I get on the phone with the board of directors. H we just found out the CEO has been lying to us and we're out of cash and we can't make payroll and we've got to shut down right away. Okay, so we came in took over and</p>
</details>

结果发现这家公司——我再说一遍，我不能说得太具体。我只能告诉你，它非常“新经济”，简直就是“互联网泡沫”的尖叫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">turns out the company and I again I can't get too specific. I can tell you it was so new economy that it just screams peak.com</p>
</details>

这是我很久以来听过的最愚蠢的概念，我真希望我能告诉你那是什么。这家公司原本准备以5000万美元的价格出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">silliest concept that I had heard in a long time and I wish I could tell you what it was. company was teed up to be sold for $50 million</p>
</details>

首席执行官现金告罄，但试图延长他的运营时间以完成出售。所以他不断地向高利贷者借钱，几乎就像支票兑现店一样，一次又一次地借25万美元，试图支付工资并延长他的运营时间，直到他能完成出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the CEO was running out of cash but trying to extend his runway to get to the sale. So he was going to hard money lenders almost like check cashing shops and borrowing $250,000 at a time again and again and again to try to pay for payroll and extend his runway till he could get the sale done.</p>
</details>

他时间不够了。董事会发现他在做这些事。他们发现公司没有任何现金了，于是立即关闭了公司。现在，买家仍然对这家公司非常感兴趣，但公司实际上已经不复存在了。所有员工都被解雇了。所有系统都被关闭了，但他们仍然拥有技术。他们仍然拥有专利。他们仍然拥有界面。他们仍然拥有客户群。他们仍然拥有商业计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He ran out of time. The board found out that he was doing this. They found out they didn't have any cash left over and they shut the company down right away. Now, the buyer was still very interested in the company, but the company didn't really exist anymore. All of the employees were terminated. All the systems were shut down, but they still had the the technology. They still had the patents. They still had the interface. They still had the customer base. They still have the business plan.</p>
</details>

所以买家说：“我们仍然想购买这项技术，但我们不会再支付5000万美元了。”所以我们进行了一些谈判。我们把公司四处推销了一下，但这些人已经在谈判桌上，他们准备购买。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the buyer said, "We'd still like to buy the technology, but we're not going to pay $50 million anymore." So, we negotiated a little bit. We shopped the company around a little bit, but these guys were at the table and they were ready to buy.</p>
</details>

他们以1500万美元的价格购买了这家公司。他们基本上获得了相同的技术。现在，他们必须把“Humpty Dumpty”（指一个破碎的东西需要重新组装）重新组装起来，但他们通过这个ABC破产程序以非常优惠的价格购买了这家公司。不必经历破产。不必支付所有那些费用。它在几周内而不是几个月内完成，他们得到了他们想要的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They bought the company for $15 million15. They got essentially the same technology. Now, they had to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, but they got a great bargain buying the company through this ABC insolveny process. Didn't have to go through bankruptcy. Didn't have to pay all those fees. It was done in a matter of weeks, not months, and they got what they were looking for.</p>
</details>

同时，我能够收集到足够的资金来全额偿还风险贷款人，这很罕见。现在，有一些无担保债权人没有得到偿还，股权当然也完全没有价值了，但这项技术得以存活。他们雇佣了一些前员工。优先贷款人得到了偿还。这在我的世界里是一个相当不错的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, I was able to collect enough money to repay the venture lender in full, which is rare. Now, there are unsecured creditors that weren't paid, and equity, of course, is completely out of the money, but the technology lives on. They hired some of the former employees. The senior lender got paid. That's a pretty good outcome in my world.</p>
</details>

Jill: 我不知道你是否有这方面的经验，但在我看来，寻找合适的买家，人工智能可能会非常有用。你遇到一些你以前从未遇到过的资产，比如人头等等，然后我进去说：“什么样的买家可能会在市场上购买人头或其他什么？”我很好奇你是否发现情况确实如此，因为我想象，你知道，你的通讯录、你的直觉、你所做的研究，但你是否发现随着时间的推移，你所在行业的技术使得快速找到某些资产的理想买家变得更容易了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if you have experience with this, but to my mind, it strikes me that for finding the right buyers, it seems like this is where AI could be really useful. You come upon some asset that you've never experienced before, like human heads, etc., And then I go in and say, "What is the type of buyer that would maybe be in the market to purchase human heads or whatever?" I'm curious if you found that to be the case because I imagine, you know, your rolodex, your intuition, the research you do, but have you found that technology over time in your industry has made it easier to rapidly locate the ideal buyer of certain certain assets?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 有一点。我现在54岁。我的合伙人比我年轻，所以他们对此更感兴趣也更精通。但当我找到一家拥有待售资产的公司时，我就会对公司所有者，或者知识产权的发明者，或者公司总裁说，告诉我，你知道，

<details>

<p class="english-text">A a bit. Now, I'm 54. My partners are younger than I am, so they're more interested and savvy at doing that. But when I find a company who has an asset for sale, I say to the the owners of the company or the inventor of the intellectual property or the president of the company, tell me, you know,</p>

<p class="english-text">Give me the top four or five people that you know off the top of your head, and then I'm going to use AI to develop a larger list. Got it?</p>

<p class="english-text">I can usually get that to 50 or or up to a hundred of people really targeted. I've got thousands of people in my database, but I don't want to send this opportunity to everybody. I want the people in that industry have a chance to look at it.</p>
</details>

Jill: 我刚刚在Perplexity中输入了这个问题：“我合法地获得了一些人头，需要出售。潜在买家会是谁？”它给了我一个列表，包括具体的名称，如**Bone Dealers**（骨头经销商）、**Skulls Unlimited**（头骨无限）和**The Bone Room**（骨头屋）。我不知道这是否是幻觉。

有一次，我担任一家典当连锁店的接管人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At one point, I was serving as a receiver for a chain of pawn shops.</p>
</details>

现在，**接管**（receivership: 法院任命第三方接管公司资产以保护债权人利益的程序）与破产有点不同。它与我们谈论的ABC也不同。在这种情况下，贷款人甚至投资者对管理层失去信心，他们想要一个“保姆”。他们想要一个能够控制现金、监督管理层、也许雇佣和解雇管理层、最终也许出售公司的人。但这并不是你想要关闭公司或摧毁什么的时候。你只是想要一些成人监督。所以我担任了这家典当连锁店的接管人，它实际上是支票兑现店。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a receiverhip is a little bit different than a bankruptcy. It's different than the ABC we talked about. It is the case that a lender or even investors don't have faith in management and they want a babysitter. They want someone to can keep take control of the cash, look over management shoulders, perhaps hire and fire management, ultimately perhaps sell the company. But this is not when you want to shut a company down or destroy something. You just want some adult supervision. So I served as a receiver for this chain of pawn shops, which was really check cashing stores,</p>
</details>

但他们经营黄金。他们的总部有一个大金库，用来存放一些黄金。如果你去支票兑现店，你有一条金项链，你想借50美元，他们会留下你的金项链。但当人们把他们的金牙存入金库时，情况变得非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but they dealt in gold. They had a big vault in their headquarters where they would store some of the gold. If you go into a check cashaching store and you have a gold necklace and you want to borrow $50, they'll keep your gold necklace. It got very interesting though when people were depositing their gold teeth into the vault.</p>
</details>

你知道，如果他们不回来偿还贷款，金牙就会留在金库里。所以，我们有很多有趣的事情要处理。再说一次，在支票兑现店，所有现金业务，你会看到很多100美元的钞票，成桶成桶地漂浮着。所以，新经济，旧经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, if they don't come back and repay the loan, the gold teeth stay in the vault. So, we had a lot of interesting things to deal with there.

Tracy: 我们之前在开始前聊过，你做过一家滑板车公司，我一直对那些滑板车公司感到好奇，因为你知道，有些还在运营。那个行业的所有公司似乎都很糟糕。那些上市的公司表现都很差。

</details>

Jill: Joe，你对滑板车很看好。是的，我知道你会这么说。我非常看好滑板车。我实际上仍然喜欢它们。当我在城市里时，它们是中等距离出行的不错方式。尽管如此，我的理解是，它们在美国至少没有特别盈利。当他们有一堆旧的品牌滑板车散落在各处时，会发生什么？

<p class="english-text">Joe, you were very scooters. Yes, I knew you were going to say that. I was very bullish on the scooters. I still actually like them. When I'm in a city, it's not a bad way to get around medium length distances. Nonetheless, my understanding is that they have not been particularly at least in the US, particularly profitable companies. What happens when they have like a bunch of old branded uh scooters laying around?</p>

David Johnson: 这是一个有趣的问题。这是一个有趣的行业。我认为可能投资过度了。我有一个故事，既有好的结果，也有坏的结果。

<p class="english-text">That's an interesting question. It isn't an interesting business. I think it was probably overinvested in I have a story with both a good outcome and a bad outcome.</p>
</details>

好的。一家名为Super Pedestrian的公司，我不太熟悉，但它和Lime、Bird一样，做着完全相同的事情，在欧洲有很大的影响力。这家公司现金告罄。风险贷款人（不是银行，而是风险贷款人）联系了我们，说：“我们需要有人来弄清楚该怎么做。我们如何收回我们的钱？这里一定有价值。我们投资了数不清的钱。我们在美国各地、欧洲各地都有很多滑板车。你该怎么办？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, a company called Super Pedestrian, which is not one I was familiar with, but it's up there with Lime and Bird and it does the exact same thing, has a very large presence in Europe. The company ran out of cash. The venture lender, not a bank, but the venture lender contacted us and said, "We need somebody to figure out what to do. How do we get our money back? There's got to be value here. We invested X gazillion dollars. We've got a lot of scooters all over the United States, all over Europe. What do you do?"</p>
</details>

所以我们从欧洲开始。结果发现欧洲投资者对此非常感兴趣。所以我们在西班牙有滑板车。我们在英国有滑板车。我们在法国有滑板车。我们在德国有滑板车。我们在瑞士有滑板车。我在欧洲的工作不多。我不了解欧洲的破产法。我不了解所有那些非常不同的法律。我有时在那里工作，但我有时依赖当地专家。但那项业务受到了很多关注。幸运的是，我们能够联系到英国的律师，他们在召集所有这些买家和销售方面做得非常出色。这次我们不必拆分公司。我们将德国实体、法国实体和西班牙实体全部出售给了一家挪威公司，该公司资金充足，并且相信滑板车业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we started out in Europe. Turns out there was a lot of interest from European investors. And so we had scooters in Spain. We had scooters in the UK. We had scooters in France. We had scooters in Germany. We had scooters in Switzerland. And I don't do a lot of work in Europe. I don't know European insolveny law. I don't know all the very different ones. I sometimes do work over there, but I rely on local specialists sometimes. But I had a lot of attention on that business. Fortunately, we were able to get council in the UK who did a fantastic job of corelling all of these buyers and selling. We didn't have to take apart the companies this time. We sold the German entity and this French entity and the Spanish entity all to a company I think from Norway who was wellunded and believed in scooters.</p>
</details>

所以我们能够在短短一两个月内完成这项交易。那项业务仍在继续。我仍然在新闻中看到它们。另一方面，我们在美国就没有那么幸运了。我们没有找到任何对当地业务足够感兴趣的人。经过大量的搜索、大量的账单支付和大量的房东锁住滑板车之后，据我所知，那些滑板车仍然停放在洛杉矶和华盛顿特区的街角，也许在某个地方的底部。

<p class="english-text">And so we were able to flip that almost in in a matter of a month or two. And that business is still going. I still see them in the news.

我喜欢滑板车，但我确实认为它带有一种奇怪的公共破坏元素，在某种程度上，一家公司认为它可以把产品随意放置在社区周围。这就像什么？它们是从哪里来的？然后你会在沟渠里看到它们。反正，Tracy，继续说。

Tracy: 我想问的是，那些剩下的滑板车，公司是否会对那些可能发生的事情负责，或者如果它们造成了某种事故？如果我在人行道上骑车，不小心撞上了一辆废弃的滑板车，我能起诉那家倒闭的公司吗？

David Johnson: 这既是福也是祸。我记得几年前滑板车刚来到洛杉矶时，人们会把它们扔进河里，扔进海里。这让我很惊讶，这种商业模式竟然能奏效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's both a blessing and a curse. I remember when the scooters first came to Los Angeles a few years ago, and people would just throw them in the river, throw them in the ocean. It was astounding to me that that business model could work.</p>
</details>

有人相信它。洛杉矶周围仍然有很多那样的滑板车。再说一次，除非技术活跃，否则它们没有用。所以，我不知道发生了什么。我最终在那件事完全解决之前离开了那家公司。但这就是问题所在。有各种各样的政府罚款。城市会处以罚款，或者要求我们有保险，例如，如果我们打算运营滑板车。所以，我们有点束手无策。我们不想运营一家滑板车公司。我有一家小公司，人手不足。如果我能支付他们工资，我当然可以依靠一些前员工，但我不想运营那样的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Somebody believed in it. There are a lot of those scooters still around Los Angeles. And again, they're not useful unless you have the technology active. So, I I don't know what happened. I I wound up leaving that company before that was fully resolved. But that is the question. There were all sorts of government penalties. Cities imposed fines or wanted to make sure we had insurance, for example, if we were going to operate scooters. So, we're a little bit hamstrung. We don't want to be operating a scooter company. I've got a small firm and I'm not staffed. I can certainly rely on some of the former employees if I can pay them, but I don't want to be operating a company like that.</p>

### 法律与道德的边界：个人数据与核废料

Jill: 但实际上我想象，在——我的意思是23andMe是一个极端的例子，因为它太个人化了。但我不得不想象，个人身份信息在很多互联网初创公司中实际上非常普遍，人们必须提交信息才能设置账户等等。我想象，有很多也许没那么棘手但仍然相当棘手的问题，这些公司会遇到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But actually imagine that in a I mean 23 and me is an extreme example because it's so personal. But I have to imagine personal identifiable information is actually got to be pretty common in a lot of internet startups etc where people have to submit information to set up an account etc. I imagine that there are a lot of maybe not quite as tricky but still pretty tricky questions that are raised with some of these companies.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 我们确实必须小心。我去年早些时候出售了一家票务公司。实际上，我在票务行业做了四五笔交易，就像StubHub的竞争对手一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have to take care. I I sold a business earlier last year in the ticketing. Actually, I've done four or five deals in the ticketing business like a StubHub type competitor.</p>
</details>

当然，那里有信用卡信息和个人信息。我们通常不销售这些。所以，只要我小心确保它不会在公众中传播，我就不必太担心。有时，如果我出售一家公司，我必须审查他们的互联网隐私政策，以确保我能够出售客户列表。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there are, of course, credit card information and and personal information. We don't generally sell that. And so, as long as I'm careful that it doesn't get disseminated out in the public, I don't have to worry about that too much. There is sometimes the case if I sell a company, I have to review their internet privacy policy to make sure I'm able to sell the customer list. Mhm.</p>
</details>

我们确实认真对待这一点，我们确实与律师合作，以确保我们不会承担责任。当然不想做那些决定，然后有人回来指责我做了违法的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we do take that seriously and we do work with council to make sure that we aren't going to be on the hook. Certainly don't want to make those decisions and have someone come back and say I did something illegal.</p>
</details>

Jill: 我可以坐在这里听公司失败的故事几个小时，但我们时间不多了。所以我只问最后一个问题，那就是对于异类资产，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I could sit here and listen to corporate failure stories for hours, but we are running out of time. So I'm just going to ask one other question which is for esoteric assets,</p>
</details>

你如何确保你获得了合理的价格？比如人头这样的东西，我想象人头没有二级市场。我的意思是，没有交易所显示价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you go about ensuring that you have that you're getting a reasonable price? So something like human heads, I imagine there is no secondary market for human heads. There's no What I mean is there's no exchange showing you a price.</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 没有基准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no benchmark.</p>
</details>

Jill: 对。没有人头价格的基准。所以有人可能会给你一个报价，但我想象，如果没有那个特定市场的专业知识，你不一定会知道价格是否合理。那么，你如何确保你获得了尽可能多的钱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. There's no benchmark human head price. So someone could make you an offer, but I imagine without expertise in that particular market, you wouldn't necessarily know if it was a good price or not. So how do you go about making sure that you're getting the most money possible?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 我经常被问到这个问题，答案是没有基准。对于这些非常独特、在某些情况下非常有趣的技术资产，没有流动市场。你必须询问市场。一件东西的价值取决于别人愿意为它支付多少钱。所以，重要的是我能把机会呈现在所有可能感兴趣的人面前。这就是我之前说的，那个行业里有50到100人。如果我把它推销给所有应该了解它并知道如何估值的人，而他们说：“抱歉，我不感兴趣。”那么我就可以相当确定它今天没有市场价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I get that question a lot and the answer is there are no benchmarks. There's no liquid market for these type of assets that are very unique and very interesting technology in some cases. You have to ask the market. Something is worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. So, it's important that I get the opportunity in front of everybody who might have an interest. That's why I said earlier 50 to 100 people in that industry. And if I shop it to all of the people who should know what it is and how to value it, and they say, "Sorry, I'm not interested." then I can be pretty sure it's got no market value today.</p>
</details>

如果我能让四五个人说：“嘿，这很有趣。让我做些功课。让我和管理层谈谈。让我提出一个报价。”然后我得到四五个报价，而且这些报价都集中在300万美元左右。那么，我就确定了这项技术的市场价值。如果我有三个报价是50万美元，一个报价是500万美元，我就会选择500万美元的报价。那就是这项技术的价值。所以，我比任何人都更清楚这项技术值多少钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I get four or five people to say, "Hey, this is interesting. Let me do some homework. Let me talk to management. Let me make an offer." And I get four or five offers and the offers are all centered around $3 million. Well, I've identified the market value of that technology. If I've got three offers at $500,000 and one offer at $5 million, I'm going to grab the $5 million offer. That's the value of the technology. So, I know better than anybody else what that technology is worth.</p>
</details>

事实上，在将近20年的时间里，我只上过一次法庭，我想，就是这个Co-apt案子，我告诉你，我以300万美元的价格出售了这项技术，偿还了有担保贷款人，但没有钱留给其他人。有一位原告律师代表一些声称受伤的人，不是因为我们讨论的这项新技术，而是因为公司做的其他事情，某种皮肤磨削器之类的。那些患者可能有潜在索赔，或有条件的索赔。他们声称遭受了伤害。他们没有被判决。没有判决。但原告律师可能有案子，因为患者可能遭受了痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, I had to go to court only one time, I think, in almost 20 years where it was this co-apt case again, I'll tell you that, where I sold the technology for, let's call it, $3 million, and I repaid the secured lender and there was no money for anybody else. There was a plaintiff's attorney who was representing some people who had said that they were injured, not by this new technology we discussed, but something else the company had done, some kind of dermapiller or something. And those patients had potential claims, contingent claims. They said they suffered injury. They weren't adjudicated. There were no judgments. But the plaintiff's attorney may have had a case as patients may have suffered.</p>
</details>

然而，当我们出售这项技术时，有足够的钱偿还银行，但没有钱留给其他人。原告律师把我们告上了法庭，他们说：“是的，你以300万美元的价格出售了公司，但如果你知道自己在做什么，Johnson，你会以1100万美元的价格出售，我们所有人都会得到偿还。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nevertheless, when we sold the technology, there was enough money to pay back the bank and nobody else. The plaintiff's attorney took us to court and they said, "Yes, you sold the company for $3 million, but if you know what you were doing, Johnson, you would have sold it for $11 million and we all would have gotten paid."</p>
</details>

他说：“我这里有一个象牙塔经济学家。”他说这家公司值1100万美元。我说：“真的吗？”他说：“这是我的文件夹。这是我联系过的出售这项技术的人。50、60、70个。这是其中10个表示有兴趣查看的人。”他们签署了**保密协议**（non-disclosure agreements: 法律合同，规定双方或多方之间共享的机密材料或信息不得向第三方披露）。在进行尽职调查后，其中四家公司向我提出了购买公司的报价。我选择了价格最高的那家。所以，如果你的象牙塔经济学家想以1100万美元购买这家公司，我真希望我能遇到他。我很乐意卖给他。但我在现实世界中知道，一件东西的价值取决于别人愿意支付多少。我问了所有人，这就是他们告诉我的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He says, "I have an ivory tower economist right here at my desk." and he says this company was worth $11 million. And I said, "Really?" He goes, "Here's my binder. Here are the people that I reached out to to sell this technology. 50, 60, 70 of them. And here are the 10 that said they were interested in looking at it." And they signed non-disclosure agreements. And after doing their diligence, four of them came to me with an offer to buy the company. And I chose the one with the highest price. So, if your ivory tower economist wanted to buy this company for $11 million, I sure wish I would have met it. I would have been happy to sell it to him. But I know in the real world that something is worth what someone's willing to pay. And I asked everybody and this is what they told me.</p>
</details>

### 关键教训：尽早介入的重要性

Jill: 我再问最后一个问题。我无法抗拒，但关于企业死亡，你希望更多的管理者或企业家能学到并内化什么教训？如果你能给那些失败公司或设法生存但总有失败风险的公司的管理者一条建议，那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to ask one more question. I can't resist, but is there a lesson about corporate mortality that you wish more executives or entrepreneurs would learn and internalize? If you could give a piece of advice to executives of failing companies or companies that are managing to survive, but there's always a risk of failure, what would it be?</p>
</details>

David Johnson: 顺便说一句，我赢得了那个官司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I won the court case. By the way,</p>
</details>

我会给你每个人都会说的同样建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll give you the same advice that that everybody says.</p>
</details>

尽早来找我们总是明智的，而不是拖延。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coming to us earlier rather than later is always wise.</p>
</details>

你只有现金流允许你存在的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You only have as long as your cash runway allows you to be there.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你有六个月的现金，而不是六周的现金，我就可以进行更彻底的搜索。我可能会找到其他买家，创造更多价值，我可以在更长的时间内留住更多人。我可以为技术的保存做更好的准备。所以，越早越好。我做了很多应急计划。人们来找我，说：“我有一个报价，但我不知道它是否会成交。那么，我该如何为不利情况做准备？”或者，“我们认为我们会获得下一轮风险投资，但万一没有，我该怎么办？”所以，我做了很多那样的计划。我们拥有的时间越多，结果就越好。另一方面，我以前也接到过电话：“我周五发不出工资了。你能帮我吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you have six months worth of cash instead of six weeks worth of cash, I can do a more thorough search. I can come up with potentially other buyers, create more value, I can keep more people around for a longer period of time. I can make better preparations for the preservation of the technology. So earlier is always better. And I do a lot of contingency planning. People come to me and say, "I've got an offer on the table, but I don't know if it's going to close. So, how do I prepare for the downside?" Or, "We think we're going to get that next round of venture funding, but just in case it doesn't come in, what do I do?" So, I do a lot of that kind of planning. And the more time we have, the better. On the other hand, I have gotten the phone call before. I can't make payroll on Friday. Can you help me?</p>
</details>

Jill: 应该早点给我打电话。David Johnson，我想如果我是一家公司的董事会成员，你出现了，说：“你知道吗，情况很艰难，但我们会为你争取到最大价值。”我想我会感觉很好。我觉得你会为我们做得很好。非常感谢你来到Odd Lots，告诉我们这个我一无所知的利基领域。这很有趣。谢谢你，Joe。谢谢你，Tracy。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should have called me earlier. David Johnson, I think if I were on the board of a company and you showed up and said, you know what, tough situation, but we're going to get you the max dollar. I think I'd feel really good. I feel like you'd do a good uh job for us. Really appreciate you coming on OddLotss and telling us about this niche that I knew nothing about. This has been fun. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Tracy.</p>
</details>

Tracy: Tracy，那很有趣。我对这个话题一无所知，他是最完美的嘉宾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, that was a lot of fun. I didn't know anything about any of this topic and uh he was the perfect guest for that.</p>
</details>

是的，一个非常小众的话题，对于一个有时专门从事非常小众销售的人来说。那太有趣了。我正在努力思考我最大的收获是什么。我的意思是，我想重点是硅谷很多人对多年亏损感到多么自在，然后资金供应会突然中断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, a very niche topic for someone who specializes sometimes in very niche sales. That was so interesting. I'm trying to think what my big takeaway is here. I mean, I guess the emphasis on how comfortable a lot of Silicon Valley actually is with losing money for years and years and years and then how suddenly that tap can be turned off.</p>
</details>

Jill: 嗯，所以我觉得你最后一个问题和他的最后一个回答，关于越早越好，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so I thought your last question and his last answer about like sooner the better</p>
</details>

Tracy: 真的很有趣，也很重要。我只是觉得，如果我是一家公司的创始人，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">was really interesting and really important. And I just feel like if I were a founder of a company,</p>
</details>

Jill: 我永远不会选择“越早越好”。我会坚持到最后一刻，直到我账户里的最后一美元，以便支付工资。我永远不会打电话给David，直到我被迫离开房间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would never do sooner. I would hold out till the very last second, the last dollar in my account in order to make payroll. I would never call David up until I was absolutely forced out of the room.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 即使，你知道，你陷入了所有这些所谓的**委托-代理问题**（principal agent problems: 委托人与代理人之间利益不一致导致的问题），对吧？因为你突然为了自己而运营，作为一个试图保住股权的人，希望能继续下去。同时，你正在烧钱或信用，而且可能，你知道，每天都在减少他们的回收价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even though, you know, you get into all what do they call principal agent problems here, right? Because you're suddenly operating for yourself as someone who's trying to keep your equity in the money in the hopes that it can going on. Meanwhile, you're burning through credit or cash and probably, you know, diminishing their recovery value by the day.</p>
</details>

在公司生命周期结束时，有很多有趣的激励错位可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a lot of interesting uh incentive disalignment potential at the end of life there.</p>
</details>

Jill: 是的。我想象那些最终可能失败的初创公司创始人，他们天生可能是乐观主义者，所以他们可能坐在那里，认为他们会在最后一刻得到一个“绝杀”，然后它没有实现，为时已晚，他们手忙脚乱地支付工资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I imagine that the founders of startups that might eventually fail, they're probably optimistic by nature and so they're probably sat there thinking they might get a hailmary at the very last minute and then it doesn't materialize and it's too late and they're scrambling to make payroll.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我猜这就是董事会的职责，对吧？董事会应该解决一些这些激励一致性问题，就像，“兄弟，放弃吧。你必须开始清算阶段。”我想这就是为什么他故事中的一位创始人会借个人支票兑现贷款来维持公司运营，正是因为董事会可能不会让公司继续运营，如果他们知道公司真实的财务状况的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess this is what the board, right? The board is supposed to solve some of these incentive alignment problems and it's like, bro, come on. You got to give up. you got to you got to begin the liquidation phase, which I guess is why the founder in one of his stories was taking, you know, personal check cashing loans to keep it going precisely because the board maybe wouldn't have let it keep going had they been aware of the true financial state of the company. Although anyway, very interesting conversation,</p>
