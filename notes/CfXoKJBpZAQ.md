title: 特朗普联盟的裂痕：保守派内部的挑战与“美国优先”的辩论
---
### 特朗普联盟的裂痕与内部挑战

自唐纳德·特朗普重返权力巅峰以来，他与他一手创建的运动之间日益公开的破裂，一直是令人惊讶的故事情节之一。从可负担性问题到对外战争，右翼的关键人物现在正大胆挑战特朗普的优先事项和他（在某些方面的）有效性。今天，我的同事罗伯特·德雷珀将探讨 MAGA 运动内部日益增长的紧张关系，以及这些关系告诉我们关于后特朗普时代美国右翼可能是什么样子。

<p class="english-text">In the years since Donald Trump roared back to power, one of the most surprising storylines of his second term has been a series of increasingly public ruptures between the president and the movement he created. On everything from affordability to foreign wars, key figures on the right are now daring to challenge Trump's priorities and his effectiveness. Today, my colleague Robert Draper on the growing tensions inside the MAGA movement and what they tell us about what the American right might look like in a postTrump world.</p>

### 历史视角下的总统权力与党派演变

我们正在迎来一个“跛脚鸭总统”（lame duck president）的时代，即任期即将结束、权力或影响力显著下降的在任总统。他不再完全掌控议程，党派开始着眼于他之后的未来。但通常情况下，这种情况发生在年中选举之后，即两年之后。而现在，这位总统上任仅 10 到 11 个月，就已开始显现出历史上我们与“跛脚鸭”总统相关的疲软迹象，尽管他本不应如此。与此同时，像没有其他政治人物那样，特朗普对他的党派施加了真正的控制。党派的哲学、执政理念一直是他说了算。这种情况已经开始改变。人们开始敢于表达异议或对特朗普的执政理念提出异议，这本身就是一件非常新颖的事情。因此，这种情况的发生以及如此早地发生，都是不寻常的特征，我敢说，在总统于一月宣誓就职时，没有人会预料到。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. In a sense, Natalie, what's taking place is in step with what historically has transpired with presidencies that after a certain period, a president begins to take on the appearance of being a lame duck. he no longer is in full control of the agenda and the party begins to look at life after him. But typically that has taken place after the midterms, after a 2-year period. And so what's really notable is that this president is now just 10 to 11 months in beginning to show the signs of weakness that historically we associate with a lame duck when in fact he should not be a lame duck. Right? And alongside that, it's also notable that President Trump, like no other political figure before him in recent memory, at least has exerted a real strangle hold over his party. The party's philosophy, the party's governing ideology has been whatever President Trump has said it will be. That has started to change. and the fact that people are daring and and let's be clear, not everyone is, but that anyone is beginning to voice objections or take exception to President Trump's governing philosophy is something very new. So, the fact that it's happening at all and the fact that it's happening so early are both unusual features that were, I don't think, in any way expected when this president first took his oath in January. Right.</p>

### 裂痕初现：查理·柯克与“爱泼斯坦文件”争议

这确实令人震惊，因为似乎就在几个月前，我们还认为这位总统是无所不能的、不可战胜的。他以巨大的授权席卷而来。他左手右手地采取行政行动。而你现在说，他正被他自己党内的人视为脆弱的。这听起来像是……是的。当特朗普总统第二次宣誓就职时，右翼有人宣称这是美国的黄金时代，他们真的相信没有什么是不可能的。然而，这种情况在夏末开始改变，当时我们开始看到著名的保守派影响者敢于偏离政府的政策信息，甚至公然反驳政府的首选政策。因此，他们开始含蓄地宣布总统不再是全能的，并在本届政府中预示着一种脆弱性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It does strike me as honestly stunning because it feels as though just a few months ago we were thinking of this president really as as all powerful as kind of invincible. He was swept in with this mandate. He was taking executive actions left and right. And very quickly you're saying he's now being seen within his own party as vulnerable. It sounds like >> that's right. And when President Trump took his second oath of office, there were people on the right proclaiming this the golden era of America, they really believed that nothing would be impossible with this president. But that began to change, however, in the late summer when we began to see prominent conservative influencers dared to go off message from administration policy and in fact outright contradict what the administration's preferred policy was. And so in doing so they began implicitly to announce that the president was no longer omnipotent and to precage a kind of vulnerability in this administration.</p>

### 塔克·卡尔森与尼克·富恩特斯的争议性访谈

我能确定一个日期。今年 9 月 10 日，查理·柯克（Charlie Kirk）被暗杀。柯克是“美国转折点”（Turning Point USA）的负责人，不仅是一位保守派活动家，还是总统的亲信。而且，纳塔莉，运动内部已经出现了裂痕。总统拒绝释放“爱泼斯坦文件”（Epstein files）引发了不满。总统决定轰炸伊朗的核设施也引起了担忧，而查理·柯克未能完全平息这些日益增长的担忧。我想尝试解决我们许多听众正在通过电子邮件向我们提出的问题。我当然指的是“爱泼斯坦事件”。柯克所能做的就是缓和对总统的批评。每个人都知道我对“爱泼斯坦事件”的看法。我很想看到司法部采取行动解封大陪审团的证词。我认为这将是一个巨大的胜利。对外而言。我认为我们应该释放“爱泼斯坦文件”。一旦柯克意识到总统在这件事上的立场，即他不希望听到右翼影响者再谈论“爱泼斯坦事件”，柯克就能够巧妙地将焦点从他推动释放文件，转变为说：“我将信任凯什·帕特尔（Cash Patel）、丹·博尼诺（Dan Bonino）、J.D. 万斯（JD Vance）。这是他们的球，是他们的责任。我对政府处理此事的能力充满信心。我已经表明了我的立场。”而这一观点成为了右翼人士普遍的谈论焦点。我将信任我在政府的朋友来做该做的事情。我已经说过了。

<p class="english-text">I can place a date on it. that date of September 10th of this year when Charlie Kirk was assassinated. Kirk, the head of Turning Point USA, was not only a conservative activist but a confidant of the president. And to be clear, Natalie, there were already fissurers in the movement. There was disqu over the president's entrangence regarding his refusal to release the Epstein files. There was concern relating to the president's decision to bomb nuclear facilities in Iran and Charlie Kirk was unable to tamp down altogether those growing concerns. I want to try to address the issue that many people in our audience are emailing us about. I'm of course talking about the Epstein situation. What Kirk was able to do was to modulate criticisms of the president. Everyone knows my opinion about the Epstein thing. I I I would love to see the DOJ move to unseal the grand jury testimony. I think that would be a big win to say externally. I think that we should release the Epstein files. And once it became evident to Kirk where the president stood on this that he didn't want to hear right-wing influencers talking about the subject of Epstein anymore. Kirk was able to expertly pivot away from him pressing for the release of the files to saying >> I'm going to trust Cash Patel, Dan Bonino, JD Vance. It's their ball. It's their possession. I have full faith in the administration's ability to look into this matter. I've said my piece and that viewpoint became the prevailing talking point amongst figures on the right. I'm going to trust my friends in the government to do what needs to be done. I've said</p>

### 保守派阵营的强烈反应与分裂

这是柯克在整体右翼信息上传递纪律的独特技巧。人们在这方面看重柯克，因此，当他在 9 月 10 日遇刺时，这种纪律几乎立即开始瓦解。没有了他，人们开始觉得保守派运动或 MAGA 运动不再是迷失方向，而是充斥着所有这些紧张关系。那么，罗伯特，你首先在哪里看到了这种损失对 MAGA 的影响？比如，在柯克去世后，这些正在酝酿的分歧开始公开化的第一个例子是什么？我认为，在这些不满和分歧变得非常公开的第一个时刻是塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）在他的节目中接待了白人至上主义者尼克·富恩特斯（Nick Fuentes）。富恩特斯曾被视为保守派运动中的一个禁忌人物，一个他们非常想将其边缘化的人，因为他曾随意发表一些毫不掩饰的、反犹太主义的、种族主义的和性别歧视的言论。他曾暗示，关于 600 万犹太人在大屠杀中丧生的数字是不准确的。他曾直言不讳地说，黑人在吉姆·克劳（Jim Crow）时期比现在过得更好。他对女性发表了各种令人厌恶的言论，认为她们基本上应该被当作财产使用。最重要的是，他不仅批评以色列和以色列政府，还聚焦于他所谓的“美国有组织的犹太人问题”。并且毫不悔改地相信犹太人是一个问题，他们无法融入，并且固执地不愿融入，而这给美国带来了最严重的问题。因此，对于卡尔森来说，他可以说是美国最有影响力的保守派声音，一个在总统特朗普的各种分歧中始终非常亲近的人，并且与副总统 J.D. 万斯尤其亲近。让尼克·富恩特斯有机会宣泄他那些充满偏见的言论，是许多人对此访谈感到极度担忧的原因。

<p class="english-text">This was the unique skill of Kirk to enforce a kind of discipline in the overall message of the right. People looked to Kirk in that regard and correspondingly then when he was gunned down on September the 10th, that discipline almost immediately began to give way. And without him, it began to feel like the conservative movement or the MAGA movement was not so much cast a drift but reverberating with all of these tensions. So, Robert, where do you first see the impact of that loss on MAGA? Like, what's the first example of these divisions that were bubbling up starting to spill out in the open after Kirk's death? I think the first moment at which these discontents, disagreements became very public was when Tucker Carlson hosted on his show the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Fuentes had been considered a sort of verboten figure in the conservative movement, a guy they very much wanted to keep at the margins because he has casually issued some unabashedly anti-semitic and racist and sexist commentary. He has suggested that the numbers don't add up when it comes to 6 million Jews perishing in the Holocaust. He has said outright that blacks were better off under Jim Crow than they are today. He has made all sorts of obnoxious statements regarding women and how they should essentially be used as chatt. And most of all, he has not just spoken critically of Israel and the Israeli government, but he has honed in on what he calls the problem of organized jewelry in America. and has been unapologetic in his belief that Jews are a problem, unassimilable and encouraable in their unwillingness to assimilate and that that presents America with its foremost problem. And so for Carlson, who is arguably the most influential conservative voice in America, a person who remains very close to President Trump through the thick and thin of their disagreements and who is especially close to Vice President JD Vance. To be offering Nick Fuentes an opportunity to air his bigoted musings was the reason why so many people viewed this interview with great alarm.</p>

### 马乔里·泰勒·格林：从铁杆盟友到批评者

请告诉我关于尼克·富恩特斯的情况。他是什么人？当然。尼克·富恩特斯是一位 27 岁的右翼网红，自 2017 年以来一直活跃于公众视野。他是特朗普总统的早期且响亮的追随者，但并非特别有影响力。2017 年，他开始出现在媒体上，因为在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔举行的“团结右翼集会”（Unite the Right rally）上，出现了“你们不会取代我们，犹太人不会取代我们”的臭名昭著的口号。火炬手。是的。他当时也在场。因此，他开始获得一些关注，但总体上被右翼排斥。即使他与 Kanye West 一起在海湖庄园（Mar-a-Lago）与特朗普总统共进晚餐，情况也是如此。这些是富恩特斯零星的露面，但他仍然被认为不是一个重要人物。但与此同时，对吧？特朗普并没有否认富恩特斯。在那次臭名昭著的午餐后，他也没有谴责他。他只是说了一些话，比如，“我不知道这个人是谁。我没有邀请他。”但没有直接否认。是的。这是一个关键点。纳塔莉，特朗普拒绝说，“顺便说一句，如果我知道，我绝不会带他来，你知道的，在海湖庄园”，这与佐治亚州国会议员玛乔里·泰勒·格林（Marjorie Taylor Greene）和国会议员保罗·戈萨尔（Paul Gosar）在 2021 年和 2022 年出现在尼克·富恩特斯的“美国优先”（America First）会议上的声明非常吻合。那么，这里发生了什么？为什么拒绝公开谴责富恩特斯？原因在于，他们都认识到，无论富恩特斯是或不是什么，他都拥有一大批年轻、男性、几乎全是白人、心怀不满的保守派追随者，这是特朗普联盟的关键组成部分。没有人愿意谴责富恩特斯，因为害怕谴责他的追随者。没错。他们希望他离开这个阵营，但他们仍然想要他的人。因此，他一直给保守派运动带来一个难题。主要是他们的观点是，希望他会消失，这些年轻、心怀不满的男性保守派会找到另一个“大哥”式的人物。所以，情况就是这样，直到今年八月和九月初，塔克·卡尔森在节目中偶然评论富恩特斯，说富恩特斯只是一个住在地下室里说些令人厌恶的话的孩子。富恩特斯将此视为一个机会，在他的播客上连续多天进行反驳，这反过来又极大地增加了他的追随者，并引起了人们对富恩特斯与卡尔森之间争执的关注。因此，所有右翼播客主都开始谈论这件事。最终，卡尔森本人决定，并且坦率地说，被他的一些朋友说服，他们告诉他，你低估了这个人富恩特斯。他实际上拥有相当大的追随者，然后卡尔森决定邀请他上自己的节目。尼克·富恩特斯，谢谢你接受采访。是的，谢谢你的邀请。我想见见你。我听说过你。所以，嗯，谢谢。嗯，这真是一段非常友好的两个小时。你就是这样的人之一。我想见你的原因之一是你是一个被剪辑片段定义的人。是的。我也是这样的人。所以我明白。但是，卡尔森实际上是将麦克风递给了富恩特斯，让他自由发挥。所以，我将闭嘴，你告诉我你真正相信什么。是的，嗯，听着，我的意思是，我感谢你这么说，因为这就是我们所处的媒体环境的现实。所以，如果你不期望你了解我所有的观点，但我的意思是，就犹太人而言……

<p class="english-text">Can you tell us about Nick Fuentes? Who is he? >> Sure. Nick Fuentes is a 27-year-old right-wing influencer who had been more or less on the scene since 2017. He was an early and loud supporter of President Trump, but not one of any particular consequence. In 2017, he began to pop up in the media because at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that included the notorious chant, you will not replace us, Jews will not replace us. >> The torch carriers. Yeah. >> Yes. Went was among them. So, he began to gain some traction then, but by and large was held at bay from the right. And that continued really to be the case even when he had dinner with Kanye West with President Trump at Mara Lago. These were the sort of sporadic appearances by Fuentes, but he was still viewed as not a major figure. >> And yet at the same time, right, Trump didn't disavow Fuentes. He didn't condemn him after that infamous lunch. She kind of said something like, "I didn't know who this guy was. I didn't invite him." But there was no direct disaval. >> No. And that's a salient point. Natalie Trump's refusal to say, "And by the way, had I known, I would never have brought him, you know, at Mara Lago was very much in keeping with the statements made by Marjgery Taylor Green, the congresswoman from Georgia, and Congressman Paul Gosar when each of them in 2021 and 2022 appeared at Nick Fuentes' America First conferences." So, what's going on here? Why the refusal to condemn Fentes outwardly? What that's about is that they all recognize that Fuentes, for whatever else he was or wasn't, commanded a sizable following of young male, almost entirely white, disaffected conservatives, which is a key part of the Trump coalition. And no one wished to condemn Fuentes for fear of condemning his followers. >> Right. They don't want to kick him out of the tent. >> That's right. They want him out of the tent, but they still want his people. And so it's he's presented the conservative movement with something of a conundrum throughout. Mainly them the view of Fuentes was hopefully he will just go away and these young disaffected male conservatives will find another big brother figure. So, that was the state of play until [snorts] around August and early September of this year when Tucker Carlson happened to make a sidelong comment about Fuentes on his show saying that Fuentes was just some kid living in his basement saying obnoxious things. And Fuentes saw that as an opportunity to issue days and days of rebuttals on his own podcast, which in turn really ratcheted up his following >> and brought attention not just to Fuentes visav Carlson, but Fuentes in general. And all of the podcasters on the ride began to talk about this dust up between those two. And so finally Carlson himself decided and was convinced frankly by people who were friends of his who talked to him and said you know you're underestimating this guy Fuentes. He actually has a really sizable following and um Carlson decided then to have him on his show. >> Nick Fuentes, thank you for doing this. >> Yeah, thank you for having me. >> I wanted to meet you. I've heard about you. >> I've heard about you. So >> well, thank you. Um >> and it was this very sort of genial two hours. >> You're one of those people. One of the reasons I wanted to meet you is you're one of those people who is defined by clips. >> Yes. >> And I'm one of those people also. So I get it. But >> in which Carlson in effect slid the microphone in front of Fuentes and let him riff on. >> So I'm going to just shut up and you tell me what you actually believe. >> Yeah. Well, and and listen, I mean, and I appreciate you saying that because it's that's just the reality of the media environment we're in. So if you I don't expect you to know all my views but I mean as far as the Jews are concerned</p>

### 特朗普的回击：对格林的公开抨击

那么，塔克·卡尔森为什么要这样做？你知道为什么吗？我正是这个问题。当然。嗯，我认为答案是，纳塔莉，他发现与富恩特斯有共同点，因为卡尔森本人在过去一年里越来越反以色列，或者正如他所说的，反以色列政府。我一直认为批评和质疑我们与以色列的关系是很好的，因为它很疯狂，而且对我们有害。我们从中一无所获。我完全同意你的观点。以色列政府长期以来一直是操纵美国事务的“尾巴”。我一直认为我对以色列的立场是最温和的。不恨以色列。只是不想卷入他们的战争。不想为此买单。不想为外国的堕胎支付费用。抱歉。当我们削减国内的食品券时，这真是太离谱了。这不符合“美国优先”。同时坚持他憎恶反犹太主义。我确实认为，客观上是坏的、破坏性的，就是所有犹太人都有罪，或者任何人都有罪，因为那根本不真实。而且，但总的来说，他对富恩特斯明确的反犹太主义观点非常宽容。就像我说的，你实际上无法将以色列、新保守派以及你谈论的所有这些事情与犹太身份分开。

<p class="english-text">Now why did Tucker Carlson do this? Well, you know why? >> My question exactly. >> Sure. Well, and I think that the answer to that Natalie is that he was finding common cause in Fuentes because Carlson himself over the past year had become increasingly anti-Israel or as he would put it anti-Israeli government. I always thought it's great to criticize and question like our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it. I completely agree with you there. >> That the Israeli government has been the tail that has wagged the dog of American affairs for far too long. >> I've always thought I have the most world's most moderate position on Israel. Don't hate Israel. Just don't want to get involved in their wars. Don't want to pay for this. Don't want to pay for abortion on demand in a foreign country. Sorry. >> When we're cutting food stamps on our own, like this is outrageous. It's not America first >> while insisting that he abhores anti-semitism. >> What I do think is bad just objectively bad and destructive is the all Jews are guilty or all anybody is guilty of anything cuz that's just like not true. And >> but by and large, he was very accommodating towards Fuentes's view which was and is unambiguously anti-semitic. Like I said, you cannot actually divorce Israel and the neocons and all all those things that you talk about from Jewishness.</p>

### 格林辞职与“美国优先”原则的重申

塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）的地位如此之高，以前从未在节目中与富恩特斯（Fuentes）交谈过。你显然正在崛起。你才华横溢。作为一名谈话者，你肯定比我更有才华。并且给予他如此轻松地对待。尼克·富恩特斯，非常感谢你。谢谢。很高兴认识你。同样。这让许多右翼人士感到非常震惊和不恰当。塔克·卡尔森是个无名小卒。他在福克斯（Fox）出名。仅此而已。马克·莱文（Mark Levin），这位右翼广播员，谴责了卡尔森。“尼克·富恩特斯是我们鞋底上的口香糖。塔克·卡尔森是政治肌体上的一颗溃烂的痔疮。他们不是 MAGA。他们不是保守派。”“今天，塔克·卡尔森是美国最危险的反犹太主义者。”国会议员兰迪·费恩（Randy Fine）也表示，卡尔森的言论和他对富恩特斯友好的态度在保守派运动中没有立足之地。塔克不是 MAGA。特别是，著名的右翼播客主持人本·夏皮罗（Ben Shapiro），来自《每日 वायर》（The Daily Wire）。夏皮罗本人是一位正统派犹太人。他毫不含糊地表示。“问题不在于塔克·卡尔森上周在他的节目中邀请了尼克·富恩特斯。他完全有权利这样做，当然。问题在于塔克·卡尔森决定将尼克·富恩特斯正常化并吹捧他。这是反犹太主义。拒绝为希特勒的支持者（如尼克·富恩特斯）提供信号助推，这不是取消。批评塔克·卡尔森在言语上吹捧尼克·富恩特斯和其他反美疯子，也不是取消。因此，这次塔克-富恩特斯访谈显然触动了神经，引发了关于美以关系和反犹太主义的争议，以及保守派运动是否容忍赤裸裸的反犹太主义。我想知道特朗普在这件事上持什么立场，罗伯特，因为他显然与以色列保持着非常密切的联盟，但他也有与尼克·富恩特斯共进晚餐的记录。那么，特朗普在这件事上持什么立场？以及整个事件告诉我们关于他在这个问题上的脆弱性？是的，这是一个很好的问题，纳塔莉。一方面，我认为特朗普一直是，我们所见过的最亲以色列的总统之一。另一方面，他从未谴责过富恩特斯，副总统 J.D. 万斯也从未谴责过，尽管富恩特斯经常侮辱万斯本人、万斯的妻子以及她来自印度的家人。因此，似乎存在一种纵容偏见和反犹太主义在保守派运动中传播的许可结构，这让许多右翼人士感到不适。但你提到了脆弱性，我认为这是一个重要的关注点，不仅与反犹太主义有关，也与如何解读本届政府的优先事项有关。当总统当选时，很大程度上是因为将我们的注意力集中在国内问题上。现在，尼克·富恩特斯和塔克·卡尔森可以合理地声称，外国纠葛已经侵入了，并且在许多方面扰乱了这些政府优先事项，不仅涉及以色列，还涉及乌克兰和委内瑞拉。这似乎与人们普遍对特朗普优先事项的质疑有关，即关注外交事务、外国冲突，可能损害了对国内问题的关注。

<p class="english-text">There had never really been anyone of Tucker Carlson's stature who had spoken to Fuentes before on the air. >> You're clearly ascendant. You're enormously talented. You're more talented than I am for sure as a talker. and to give him that kind of softball treatment. >> Nick Fuentes, thank you very much. >> Thank you. >> It's nice to meet you. >> Likewise. I struck so many on the right as really alarming and inappropriate. [music] >> Tucker Carlson's a nobody. He got famous on Fox. That's it. >> Mark Levin, the right-wing broadcaster, denounced Carlson. >> Nick Fuentes is gum on the bottom of our shoe. Tucker Carlson is a bleeding hemorrhoid on the body politic. They're not MAGA. They're not conservative. >> Today, Tucker Carlson is the most dangerous anti-semite in America. >> The Congressman Randy Fine said as well that [music] Carlson's remarks and his amiable treatment of Fentes had no place in the conservative movement. Tucker is not MAGA. >> And in particular, the well-known right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire. Shapiro himself is an Orthodox Jew. He made no bones about it. >> The issue here isn't that Tucker Carlson had Nick Fentes on his show last week. He has every right to do that, of course. The issue here is that Tucker Carlson decided to normalize and fluff Nick Fuentes. That >> this is anti-semitism. It is not cancellation to refuse to signal boost Hitler's supporters like [music] Nick Fuentes. It is not cancellation to criticize Tucker Carlson for rhetorically fluffing Nick Fuentes and other anti-American crackpots. [music] So this Tucker Fuentes interview obviously touched a nerve over divisions on the question of the US relationship with Israel and anti-semitism and whether there is tolerance for blatant anti-semitism in the conservative movement. And I'm curious where Trump sits in all of this, Robert, because he's obviously maintained a very close alliance with Israel, but he's also been known to have a meal with Nick Fuentes. So, where is Trump on this? And what does this whole saga tell us about his vulnerability on this issue? >> Yeah, it's a great question, Natalie. and on the one hand I think that Trump has been [clears throat] one of the most pro-Israel presidents we've seen. On the other hand has at no point denounced Fuentes, nor for that matter has Vice President JD Vance despite the fact that Fuentes has routinely insulted not only Vance but Vance's wife and her family who are from India. So there is a permission structure seemingly for bigotry and anti-semitism to be aired out in the conservative movement which makes a lot of people on the right uncomfortable. But you mentioned vulnerability and I think this is an important thing to focus on not just as it relates to anti-semitism but also how one interprets this administration's priorities. when the president was elected largely on keeping our attention fixed to domestic issues. Now, Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson are able to reasonably assert that foreign entanglements have intruded into and and in many ways disrupted those administration priorities not just as regards Israel but as regards Ukraine and as regards Venezuela. And it sounds like it's connected to a kind of broader question that's being asked about Trump's priorities in general, the focus on foreign affairs, on foreign conflicts to potentially the detriment of a focus on domestic issues.</p>

### 特朗普的政治实力与联盟的脆弱性分析

我曾与塔克·卡尔森谈过这件事，当时我在 11 月花了几小时与他在一起，卡尔森对此有一个理论，他说：“听着，事实是，特朗普总统正意识到解决许多棘手国内问题有多么困难，尤其是在可负担性方面。你知道，你可以谈论鸡蛋的价格或汽油的价格，但总的来说，美国存在真正的可负担性危机，而且很难对此做些什么。”卡尔森说，相比之下，你知道，你可以去轰炸伊朗的一个核设施，知道伊朗可能不会对此做任何事，而你可以看起来很英雄，看起来很强大。所以，特朗普，尽管他自己历史上一直关注国内问题，但现在他发现，在外交政策领域比在国内更容易显得像神一样。对？我的意思是，卡尔森在这里说的话有政治逻辑。驱动特朗普当选的主要问题之一是经济。所以，我想很多人觉得他们投票给他是因为他们期望特朗普总统能像激光一样专注于钱包问题，而不是调解遥远地方的冲突，而他在这方面做了很多。但通过提出这一点，纳塔莉，你实际上引入了我认为一个重要的区别，那就是特朗普总统两个口号之间的区别。MAGA，“让美国再次伟大”，以及“美国优先”。所以，“让美国再次伟大”基本上是一个竞选口号。它与特朗普总统密不可分。我的意思是，每个人都明白，它的意思是，当奥巴马总统执政时，美国并不伟大。当特朗普总统执政时，它变得伟大。当拜登总统执政时，它又变得糟糕。现在，因为特朗普，它又变得伟大。坦率地说，这是一种个人崇拜的观念，但它最终是一个口号。“美国优先”是一项原则，而定义“美国优先”是什么，是进行有益的意识形态辩论的主题。

<p class="english-text">I talked to Tucker Carlson about this when I spent a few hours with him in uh November and Carlson had a theory on this and he said, "Look, the truth is is that President Trump is realizing how difficult it is to solve a lot of these intractable domestic issues, particularly as it relates to affordability. You know, you can you can talk about the price of eggs or something or even the price of gas, but overall there is a real affordability crisis in America and it's tough to do anything about that. Carlson said that by contrast, you know, you can go bomb a nuclear site in Iran knowing Iran probably isn't going to do anything about it and you can look heroic and you can look powerful. And so Trump, for all of his own focus historically on domestic problems, is now realizing it's easier to be godlike in the foreign policy arena than at home. >> Right? I mean, there's a political logic to what Carlson is saying here. One of the main issues driving Trump's election was the economy. And so I imagine there's a lot of people who feel like they voted for him because they expected Trump as president to have a laser-like focus on pocketbook issues rather than on mediating conflicts in far-flung places, which is something he's done a lot of in his first year. >> Right. But in raising that point, Natalie, what you're doing is essentially introducing what I think is an important distinction and that is the distinction between two slogans by President Trump. MAGA, make America great again and America first. So, make America great again is basically a campaign slogan. It's inextricably tied to President Trump. I mean, everyone kind of understands that what it means is like America wasn't great when Obama was president. It became great when Trump became president. It became terrible again when Biden was president. Now, it's great again because of Trump. It's to put it bluntly a personality cult notion, but it is finally a slogan. America first is a principle and defining what America first is is the kind of thing that's subject to useful ideological argument. M</p>

### 特朗普的“负担能力”之旅与选民焦虑

我认为，塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）和也许同样重要的是，国会议员玛乔里·泰勒·格林（Marjorie Taylor Greene）一直站在最前沿，他们说：“看，‘美国优先’的原则已经阐明。保守派、特朗普总统的选民都普遍理解了这些原则。而现在，特朗普政府已经背离了对美国人民的这些承诺。”同时，你知道，花费了大量资金在许多人感到不满的事情上，例如宴会厅。是的，他自己的行为似乎与他将美国人放在首位的承诺相悖。正是这种认知失调开始导致党内出现另一个明显的裂痕，特别是与玛乔里·泰勒·格林有关。我们将在休息后谈论她。我们马上回来。罗伯特，你提到了来自佐治亚州的国会议员玛乔里·泰勒·格林，她的人生轨迹确实是这次我们看到一些右翼人士与特朗普决裂的缩影。显然，她因成为特朗普最亲密的盟友之一而闻名，而现在她已经宣布辞职，并明确表示特朗普背叛了这场运动。所以，让我们来谈谈玛乔里·泰勒·格林的人生旅程。纳塔莉，这真是一段独特的旅程。它代表了一个 MAGA 忠诚者转变为特朗普政府的异议声音的最极端案例。但话虽如此，我认为这在更广泛的意义上反映了从每个人都精确地唱着 MAGA 的赞歌，到现在发出不和谐音符的演变。考虑到格林对特朗普如此坚定不移的支持，这真是令人瞩目。她于 2021 年初抵达华盛顿，带着毫不掩饰的亲特朗普竞选平台，期望她将成为促成特朗普总统第二个任期的一部分。然而，她抵达时，距离 1 月 6 日仅几天，特朗普已经落败。在国会骚乱之后，许多共和党人希望与这位落败的前总统划清界限，而玛乔里·泰勒·格林却是华盛顿最激烈的特朗普辩护者，对吗？她一直如此，尤其是在 2024 年的共和党全国代表大会上。她坐在他旁边的总统包厢里，并宣称特朗普是上帝的恩赐，她认为他是在拯救美国。所以，特朗普第二个任期的开始，格林坚定不移地站在他一边。但与此同时，她自己的人生轨迹与她在国会的经历交织在一起，她对自己的党派越来越感到失望，因为一旦拥有权力，党派并没有真正做什么。她开始考虑竞选其他职位，也许是参议员，也许是佐治亚州州长。但特朗普白宫非但没有给予任何鼓励，反而基本上泼了冷水。她告诉我，她觉得她对特朗普的所有忠诚都像是一条单行道。没有得到回报。是的，没错。因此，我认为这为过去两三个月发生的事情奠定了基础，她开始对共和党，甚至对特朗普总统本人越来越感到失望。我认为一个真正的引爆点是特朗普拒绝释放“爱泼斯坦文件”。这已经成为右翼人士的信仰核心，他们唯一能达成一致的就是杰弗里·爱泼斯坦是美国最邪恶的性交易者。因此，看到特朗普现在犹豫不决，然后说，“别再谈论爱泼斯坦了，那里什么都没有”，这对她来说是令人发指的。然后在政府关门期间，她开始回家，与她的选民交谈，他们会说，“你知道，住房仍然负担不起。杂货仍然负担不起。我们以为总统会对此做些什么。顺便问一下，他为什么要把所有这些钱花在以色列，而我们却看到加沙发生的可怕景象？”格林告诉我，她开始听到她的选民说出“种族灭绝”这个词，格林成为第一位公开将加沙发生的事情描述为种族灭绝的著名共和党人。因此，格林开始公开表达她的担忧。不仅仅是她表达了担忧，还在于她在哪里表达了担忧。

<p class="english-text">I think that Tucker Carlson and perhaps just as much Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green have been at the forefront of saying look America first principles have been laid out. They have been commonly understood by conservatives, by voters of President Trump. And now the Trump administration has been weward, has veered off of those commitments to Americans. >> And at the same time, you know, spending money on things that a lot of people took issue with, a ballroom, for example. >> Yes. That his own actions seem to be at variance with his pledges to put Americans first. And it's this cognitive dissonance that began to result in another noticeable fracture in the party, particularly with Marjorie Taylor Green. And we will talk about her right after the break. We'll be right back. >> [music] >> Robert, you brought up Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green from Georgia, and her evolution really feels emblematic of this break with Trump that we're starting to see among some on the right. Obviously, she became famous for being one of Trump's closest allies, and now she has since announced her resignation from office and said pretty explicitly that Trump is betraying the movement. So, let's talk about this journey that Marjorie Taylor Green has been on. >> I mean, Natalie, it is a singular journey. It represents the most extreme case of a magaloyalist becoming a dissenting voice to the Trump administration. But having said that, I do think that it does reflect in a broader sense this evolution from everyone singing with precision from the MAGA himnel to now striking discordant notes. And that [clears throat] is so remarkable given how unfl flagging a supporter Green was of Trump. She arrived in Washington in early January of 2021, freshly elected with an unapologetically proTrump campaign platform, expecting that she would be part of facilitating President Trump's second term. Instead, she arrived just a couple of days before January the 6th with Trump having been defeated. And at a time on the heels of the capital riot when a lot of Republicans wanted to distance themselves from the defeated former president, Marjorie Taylor Green was the most viciferous defender of Trump really in Washington, right? And continued to be so throughout his campaign in 2024 when he was at the Republican National Convention. She sat by his side on the second day in the presidential booth and was pledging that Trump was a gift from God and that she viewed him in kind of these theological proportions as someone who would be saving America. So the beginning of Trump's second term saw Marjorie Taylor Green unfl flaggingly by his side. But then alongside her own arc regarding Trump was her own experience in Congress when she became increasingly disillusioned with her own party that uh once it had power didn't really do anything with it and she began to think maybe of running for something else perhaps senator perhaps governor of Georgia. And far from getting any encouragement the Trump White House basically threw a wet blanket over that. She told me that she felt like all of her loyalty to Trump was amounting to a one-way street. >> It wasn't being rewarded. >> That's correct. Yes. And uh and so that sets the stage then, I think, for what began to happen over the last 2 or 3 months where she began to be increasingly disillusioned not just with the Republican party, but with President Trump himself. And I think that one real flash point was Trump's refusal to release the Epstein files. This had become an article of faith amongst the right, the one thing they could all agree on was that Jeffrey Epstein was the most heinous sex trafficker in America. And so to see now Trump hedging and then saying, "Stop talking about Epstein. There's no there there was outrageous to her." Then during the government shutdown, she began to go home and she'd talk to her constituents and they'd say, you know, housing is still unaffordable. Groceries are still unaffordable. We thought that the president was going to do something about this. And why, by the way, is he spending all this money in Israel and we're seeing this horrible footage of what's taking place in Gaza. Green told me that she began to hear the G-word genocide by her own constituents and Green became the first prominent Republican to describe what was taking place in Gaza as a genocide. So Green began to voice her concerns very publicly. And it's not just that she voiced them, but it's where she voiced them. >> [music] >> For the very first time on The View, we are joined by someone you might be surprised to see here. >> She went on The View. Please welcome Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, >> which is largely regarded as a a left-leaning show. And the spectre of this right-wing mega warrior being on a show like that was a rather remarkable one and one frankly that people on the set of The View were surprised at. I I spoke to one of them who had said that they were suspecting that Green would come in loaded for bear and just rip into all of them and once again talk about how great Trump was. >> Look, I'm with women, so I feel very comfortable saying this. I'm really tired of the pissing contest in Washington DC between the men. >> I I really >> They were not prepared at all for this really very accommodating individual >> and I feel like the government has failed all of us and it it purely disgusts me. said, "Look, things have gotten overheated in today's politics. >> I represent a district that is rural manufacturing district, bluecollar workers, and people have been crushed by decades of failure in Washington DC." And so, I have no problem pointing fingers at everyone. >> And one by one, maybe it's become a Democrat. Marjorie, >> I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Green. The co-hosts on the air expressed astonishment that this was the Marjorie Taylor Green they were seeing. [music] And in addition to the view Green was speaking to other media outlets. >> Here's my issue. I'm America first and I don't apologize for that and I believe Congress both Democrats and Republicans should be serving the American people. Though what she had to say during these interviews wasn't openly critical of the administration, implicitly she was striking a note of disagreement. >> And when you campaign on America first, it's like having a restaurant advertising like a certain type of food and then you don't deliver America first. You're not going to have those return customers. >> I don't know what happened to Marie. She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think. And it clearly got under President Trump's skin. >> Somebody like Marjorie Taylor Green who's now catering to the other side. I don't know what, you know, I guess she's, you know, got some kind of an act going on, but I'm surprised at her. But when somebody like [clears throat] Marjorie goes over and starts making statements like that, it shows she doesn't know. >> The great umbrage that he took was expressed finally. Tonight, disagreements between President Trump and one of his most reliable and vocal supporters in Congress have taken an ugly turn >> with a posting that he made on Truth Social. >> Marjorie Trader Green is a disgrace to our great Republican party. [music] He wrote on social media >> in which he called her Marjgery Trader Green belting lunatics's call every day. End quote. >> It said that she was always trying to call him, but that he had no time for this. that she was pouting because he hadn't been supportive of her political ambitions, but now he not only had had enough of her. >> The president even suggested he'd be open to backing a challenger to her seat in Congress. >> He alluded to the distinct likelihood that he would try to find a Trump loyalist who would primary her in her congressional race in 2026. [music] Yeah, I mean, this was a pretty frontal attack by Trump. So, how does Green respond? >> She was deeply upset most of all by the label of her as a traitor. And of course, the implication was that she was a traitor not just to President Trump and to the MAGA movement, but a traitor to America. And she was really outraged by that. What she also reacted to was a torrent of death threats that came in. This in a sense was not new to Green. She had gotten death threats really from early on in taking office. She was being doxed. Lots of things like that were happening. They were all happening from the left. However, now she was getting attacks from what she often described as her favorite president. Her favorite president was unleashing in her view these threats. And it's not just that the threats were levied against her. They were levied against her own children. And her children were named. I know this because Green told me that and said she was terrified. So it was really really alarming and scary for her. >> Wow. >> And uh so this was I was getting all these texts by the way, you know, from friends of mine in the political world saying she's rebranding herself. What is this about? >> And and what is your sense about what these appearances were really about? Were they driven by the feedback she was getting from her constituents? Was it something else? >> Yes. The former tinged also with the belief of what the hell, I've got nothing to lose. since whim has my unfl flagging loyalty paid off for me? It hasn't. So, she felt somewhat liberated from her allegiances to President Trump. But I think alongside that, she truly believed what she was saying. She truly had heard what her constituents had been telling her that they were like her taking the president's principle of America first, not just seriously, but literally. you know, they were saying, "Hang on, how is it America first to be um not just supporting Ukraine, but also Israel? Do we not care about women who have been victimized by the rich and powerful? And meanwhile, things are still expensive. Why isn't the president out there every day doing something about this?" These were the tenants of America First that they believed the president would be addressing, that Marjorie Taylor Green was certain he would be addressing. But she now began to have doubts in part because she was hearing her constituents raise those very same doubts. >> And not long after, >> hi everyone. >> She announces that she's going to resign. >> That's correct. >> I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington DC and [music] just never fit in. She did a video that she posted on X. >> I ran for Congress in 2020 and have fought every single day believing that make America great again meant America first. >> It was a posting that took even her close allies by surprise. >> America first should mean America first and only Americans first with no other foreign country ever being attached to America first in our halls of government. It became, I think, obvious to most, if not all, that it was really her renouncing a movement that had strayed from its core America first principle. >> I do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president that we all fought for. and that she would be fighting if she were to be reelected on behalf of a president who now disliked her and who had done her great injury, but also who no longer was the embodiment of America first. And so what was the point of [music] that? I have to ask Robert, isn't the fact that Green stepped down over this dust up a sign that Trump is actually stronger politically than we may be thinking? I mean, I think a lot of people might see this incident as him winning. He still at the end of the day had the political weight to drive one of his critics out of political office. Historically, that has been the case, just as you've described it, Natalie, that this is a show of Trump's power. But to say that now would be to ignore the atmospherics. That all of this is taking place at a point in which Trump's approval rating is near the lowest that it's ever been. at a time when people on the right like Tucker Carlson are beginning to, you know, speak with a great deal of bluntness, with real candor about the Trump administration's misguided priorities. So if this was just crushing the one lone denter and everybody then issuing a chorus on the right of good riddens to her, we all love President Trump. It'd be one thing, but that's not actually what's taken place. She simply said Trump's White House is not doing what they said they were going to do. And that sentiment is one that is beginning to gain a lot of traction on the right. It's extending to the Trump coalition that got him reelected in 2024. I don't think that his hardcore base has uh deserted him. But the bottom has really fallen out of his support amongst independents and they were key to his victory as were young people and black males and Latino males as well. Now, whether it's because of their own experiences or because they happen to be listening to Tucker Carlson, to Nick Fuentes, and to other influencers, or a combination, the polling data clearly shows that these people who were so crucial to Trump's victory in 2024 are starting to move away from him in really, really significant numbers. And so even if his core base remains steadfast, the clear and present danger for the Trump administration is that he no longer has a solid coalition of the type that brought him victory. USA.</p>

### 未来展望与时事速递

罗伯特，我想问你，你是否觉得特朗普实际上在倾听选民和像玛乔里·泰勒·格林这样的人提出的担忧？他刚刚开始了新的国内巡演，其目的是走遍全国，谈论可负担性问题。“薪水，你获得更低的物价，更高的薪水。”这确实在某种程度上承认了他在这里有问题。是的，这是真的。他肯定吸收了这一点。我认为他的易怒性已经显露无遗。“他们说他不应该旅行。他应该专注于国内。你他妈的以为我在做什么？”姿态不是“选民，我听到了你们的声音。我感受到了你们的痛苦。”远非如此。相反，他对“可负担性”这个词不屑一顾。“但是他们用了‘可负担性’这个词，这就是他们唯一的词。他们说‘可负担性’。”但我认为最让特朗普恼火的是，他的选民在第一天就普遍信任特朗普所说的一切，或者他即将要做的一切。但是他的选民所感受到的焦虑现在已经无法隐藏。我认为这导致了特朗普的防御心理。“你知道，那些愚蠢的人，他们说他不应该离开我们的国家。是的，让我们坐着无所事事。”那么，特朗普即将开始的这次巡演能否帮助弥合共和党的分歧，并恢复他作为保守派运动中唯一的声音？也许吧。但我确实认为，我们所看到的，是那些敢于让总统对其“美国优先”的承诺负责的声音的出现。随着各方在这一承诺的含义上争论不休，由此产生的裂痕将难以愈合。很难想象有什么能让所有这些碎片重新组合在一起。罗伯特，非常感谢你的时间。没问题，纳塔莉。我们将很快回来。今天还有其他你需要知道的新闻。今天的新闻很有趣。总统特朗普周三下午宣布，美国已在委内瑞拉海岸缴获了一艘油轮。一艘大型油轮。非常大。实际上是缴获的最大的一艘。这次缴获是本届政府加大对委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicholas Maduro）施压行动的明显升级。特朗普没有提供关于此次行动的任何额外细节，但匿名接受采访的美国官员表示，此次行动是经过深思熟虑的计划的结果，并且没有造成人员伤亡。此外，美联储周三投票决定将利率下调四分之一个百分点。这是连续第四次投票，并非所有成员都支持，这标志着中央银行的分裂程度之大，因为它正努力在失业率上升和顽固通胀的风险之间取得平衡。今天的节目由凯特琳·奥基夫（Caitlyn O'Keefe）和埃里克·库普基（Eric Kupky）制作，亚历克斯·斯特恩（Alex Stern）协助。由瑞秋·奎斯特（Rachel Quester）编辑，佩奇·考瓦特（Paige Cowat）协助，苏珊·李（Susan Lee）进行事实核查，音乐由玛丽安·洛扎诺（Marian Lozano）、艾丽西亚·埃图普（Alicia Etup）、丹·鲍威尔（Dan Powell）和黛安·王（Diane Wong）提供，由克里斯·伍德（Chris Wood）负责工程。这就是今天的《每日》。我叫纳塔莉·基特鲁夫（Natalie Kitroof）。明天见。

<p class="english-text">Yes. So I I talked to Tucker Carlson about this when I spent a few hours with him in uh November and Carlson had a theory on this and he said, "Look, the truth is is that President Trump is realizing how difficult it is to solve a lot of these intractable domestic issues, particularly as it relates to affordability. You know, you can you can talk about the price of eggs or something or even the price of gas, but overall there is a real affordability crisis in America and it's tough to do anything about that. Carlson said that by contrast, you know, you can go bomb a nuclear site in Iran knowing Iran probably isn't going to do anything about it and you can look heroic and you can look powerful. And so Trump, for all of his own focus historically on domestic problems, is now realizing it's easier to be godlike in the foreign policy arena than at home. >> Right? I mean, there's a political logic to what Carlson is saying here. One of the main issues driving Trump's election was the economy. And so I imagine there's a lot of people who feel like they voted for him because they expected Trump as president to have a laser-like focus on pocketbook issues rather than on mediating conflicts in far-flung places, which is something he's done a lot of in his first year. >> Right. But in raising that point, Natalie, what you're doing is essentially introducing what I think is an important distinction and that is the distinction between two slogans by President Trump. MAGA, make America great again and America first. So, make America great again is basically a campaign slogan. It's inextricably tied to President Trump. I mean, everyone kind of understands that what it means is like America wasn't great when Obama was president. It became great when Trump became president. It became terrible again when Biden was president. Now, it's great again because of Trump. It's to put it bluntly a personality cult notion, but it is finally a slogan.

It'd be one thing, but that's not actually what's taken place. She simply said Trump's White House is not doing what they said they were going to do. And that sentiment is one that is beginning to gain a lot of traction on the right. It's extending to the Trump coalition that got him reelected in 2024. I don't think that his hardcore base has uh deserted him. But the bottom has really fallen out of his support amongst independents and they were key to his victory as were young people and black males and Latino males as well. Now, whether it's because of their own experiences or because they happen to be listening to Tucker Carlson, to Nick Fuentes, and to other influencers, or a combination, the polling data clearly shows that these people who were so crucial to Trump's victory in 2024 are starting to move away from him in really, really significant numbers. And so even if his core base remains steadfast, the clear and present danger for the Trump administration is that he no longer has a solid coalition of the type that brought him victory. USA. >> I just want to say hello and I'm thrilled to be back. [cheering] Robert, I want to end by asking if you get the sense that Trump is actually listening perhaps to the concerns that are being raised by voters and by people like Marjorie Taylor Green. He's just kicked off this new domestic tour, the purpose of which is to go around the country and talk about issues of affordability. >> Paychecks, you're getting lower prices, bigger paychecks. And that does feel like an acknowledgment in some sense that he knows he has a problem here. >> Yes, that's true. He certainly absorbed this. I think that his testiness has been on full display. >> They said he shouldn't be traveling. He should focus on home. What the hell do you think I'm doing? >> The posture is not one of voters, I hear you. I feel your pain. Far from it. Instead, he has been dismissive of the word affordability. >> But they use the word affordability and that's their only word. They say affordability. >> But I think most of all, Natalie, what >> has annoyed Trump is that his voters had been generally trusting of everything that Trump said he was doing or was about to do during his first 100 days. But the anxieties that his constituents are feeling is now impossible to hide. And I think that that has created a real defensiveness with Trump. >> He said, you know, the stupid people, they say he shouldn't be leaving our country. Yeah, let's sit around and twiddle our thumbs. So, will this tour that Trump is embarking on help mend the schisms in the Republican party and restore him as the one and only voice in the conservative movement? Possibly. But I do think that what we've seen take place is an emergence of voices who dare to hold the president accountable to his America first pledge. And as various people jousted over just what that pledge should be, the fractures that ensue are really going to be impossible to heal. It's hard to imagine what would happen to bring all of those pieces back together. >> Well, Robert, thank you so much for your time. >> Sure thing, Natalie. [music] We'll be right back. [music] Here's what else you need to know today. >> This has been an interesting day from the standpoint of news. >> President Trump announced Wednesday afternoon that the US had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. large tanker. Very large. Largest one ever seized. Actually, >> the seizure was a clear escalation in the administration's [music] pressure campaign against Nicholas Maduro, the president of Venezuela. Trump didn't offer any additional details about the operation, [music] but US officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the action was the result of deliberate planning and that there were no casualties. and the Federal Reserve voted on Wednesday to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage [music] point. It was the fourth straight vote in a row that wasn't backed by all members, a mark [music] of just how fractured the central bank has become as it struggles to balance the risks of rising unemployment [music] and sticky inflation.
