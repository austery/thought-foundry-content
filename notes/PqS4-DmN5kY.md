### 欢迎来到Odd Lots播客：美国国债市场专题

**Tracy Aloway:** 大家好，欢迎收听Odd Lots播客的特别节目。我是Tracy Aloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to a very special episode of the All Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我是Joe Weisenthal。您即将听到的内容，其标题非常谦逊，名为“全球最重要的市场有史以来最棒的小组讨论”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Joe Weisenthal. So what you are about to hear has the very very modest title of the best ever panel on the world's most important market.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这个市场就是**美国国债市场**（US Treasury Market: 全球最大的主权债务市场，被视为无风险资产基准）。当然，这是我们6月26日在纽约活动上现场录制的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is the US Treasury market. Of course, this was recorded live at our New York event on June 26.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 没错。我们最近在纽约举办了Odd Lots现场活动。国债市场目前发生了很多事情。人们对利率、外国需求以及现有国债市场基础设施处理所有债务量的能力和**流动性**（Liquidity: 资产在不影响其价格的情况下，可以快速买卖的程度）存在疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. We had our recent OLATs live event in New York. And there's so much going on in the Treasury markets. There's questions about rates. There's questions about foreign demand. There's questions about liquidity and the capacity of existing Treasury market infrastructure to handle all of the volume of debt out there.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 因此，我们希望召集一些我们最喜欢的人，来真正理解正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we wanted together some of our favorite people to actually understand what's going on.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，谁会购买所有这些债券？我们确实有一个非常出色的小组。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. Who's going to buy all the bonds? And we did indeed have an absolutely amazing panel.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 小组成员包括Nelly Lang，她是布鲁金斯学会（Brookings Institution）的高级研究员，也是前美国财政部国内金融事务副部长。我们还有Ira Jersey，您可能在之前的节目中听过他，他是彭博资讯（Bloomberg Intelligence）的首席美国利率策略师。最后，还有Odd Lots节目的常客Josh Younger，他是哥伦比亚大学（Columbia University）的讲师，同时还身兼多职。我们希望您喜欢。请听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we had Nelly Lang. She is a senior fellow over at the Brookings Institution. She is also the former under secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. We had Ira Jersey, who you might remember from a previous episode. He is the chief US interest rate strategist over at Bloomberg Intelligence. And finally, we had an OddLot's favorite, Josh Younger. He is a lecturer at Columbia University, among many other things. So, we hope you enjoy. Take a listen.</p>
</details>

### 谁将购买美国国债？

**Joe Weisenthal:** 那么，有人担心谁会购买这些债务吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, is anyone worried about who's going to buy the debt?</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 谁先来回答这个问题？嗯，有人吗？我想我先开始吧。我并不担心谁会购买这些债务。你知道，当我们普遍思考市场，尤其是大型国家相对有**流动性**（Liquidity: 资产在不影响其价格的情况下，可以快速买卖的程度）的**主权债务**（Sovereign Debt: 由国家政府发行的债务，通常以本国货币计价）市场时，总会有买家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who goes first for that one? Well, anyone? I I mean, I guess I'll start. Um I I'm not worried about who's going to buy the debt. Um you know when when we think about markets generally and especially markets for sovereign debt of large countries that are relatively liquid, there will be a buyer.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 现在价格可能会变化，我认为这是我们最近几周看到的一些情况，当美国经济有所放缓时。你肯定会看到两年期收益率实际上已经下降了，在短期内下降了近50个基点，但长期收益率几乎没有变化。我认为这至少部分表明，有些人有点害怕购买这些债务，除非给它加上某种溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the price might change and I think that's one of the things we have seen somewhat um in recent weeks when you have somewhat of a slowing economy in the US. You certainly see like two-year yields have actually gone down, you know, better part of 50 basis points over the near term, but the long end hasn't done very much at all. And I think that that is at least in part an indication that there are some people who are a little bit scared to buy that debt without having some type of premium put onto it.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以它会被买走。问题是价格是多少？这就不一样了，对吧？我是一名投资策略师，而不是政策制定者。对吧？我认为有些人把我们的工作搞混了。当Nelly在财政部工作时，她对世界的看法和她必须做的事情与我们作为投资者所做的事情大相径庭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it it'll get bought. The question is at what price? And and that's different, right? Like I'm an investment strategist. I'm not a policy maker, right? Right. And and I think that there's some people who kind of messed that up with what like our job is. When Nelly was at the Treasury Department, she had a much different, you know, view of the world that she had to do as opposed to what we do as investors.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，就这一点而言，确实，我们市场中现在有比以前更多的价格敏感型买家，对吧？我们以前有很多中央银行，很多主权财富基金。它们仍然存在，但与国内买家，比如散户相比，后者的增长要快得多。Nelly，这是否改变了你对债务的看法，与几年前相比？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, on that note, it is true that we have more, I would say, price sensitive buyers in the market than we used to, right? So, we used to have a lot of central banks, a lot of sovereign wealth funds. they're still there, but compared to domestic buyers, um, retail, like that has grown a lot more. Nelly, does that change the way you think about debt versus, you know, some years ago?</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 当然。你刚才说价格会调整，总会有买家，但几十年前，我们拥有一个更稳定的投资者基础，包括中央银行和外国基金。现在，它更像是**非银行金融机构**（Non-Bank Financial Institutions - NBFI: 不具备银行牌照但提供金融服务的机构），比如对冲基金，出于各种原因，还有私人基金，它们使用国债进行流动性风险管理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. So, you said prices will adjust. There will be a buyer, but it used to be decades ago, we just had a much more stable investor base, central banks, foreign funds. Um, now it's like the non-bank, what we would call the non-bank financial institutions. It's hedge funds for various reasons, private funds who use treasuries for liquidity risk management.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 所以一旦市场变得波动，它们就会想要出售国债，以帮助管理自己的头寸。因此，投资者基础已经改变。总会有买家，但这可能会改变价格，并改变价格的波动方式。你知道，鉴于投资者基础的变化，波动性会大得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the minute things get volatile, they'll want to sell treasuries to help manage their own positions. And so the investor base has changed. There will there will be buyers but it could change the price and change the way prices fluctuate. You know there just going to be much more volatility given the changing investor base.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 这就是财政部必须定期发行债务时所考虑的问题。我当时在财政部的时候，每年大概有250次拍卖。他们会考虑这些，这确实会影响你如何看待短期国库券与长期息票债券等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's something that Treasury who has to issue the debt regularly. We can we we when I was at Treasury probably 250 auctions a year. they think about that and uh it does affect how you think about bills versus longer term coupons and all that.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 我想我可以用另一种方式来表达同样的事情。我应该先声明一下，我以为离开美联储后就可以摆脱免责声明了，但我还是要说一个免责声明，那就是这不是投资建议，我工作的地方有很多头寸，我所说的一切都不应暗示我们可能持有或不持有任何头寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess I would different way of saying the same thing. U I should start with I I I thought I'd get away from disclaimers when I left the feds but I have to say a disclaimer which is this is not investment advice and I worked at a place that has lots of positions and nothing I say should implicate what which positions we may have or not have.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 话虽如此，我认为提出这个问题的类似方式是：他们为什么要购买债务？因为市场会以某个价格出清。我们可能喜欢或不喜欢那个价格，但价格过去会因为各种原因而波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That said, uh I uh you know, I think it's uh a similar way to ask the question is why are they buying the debt? Because the market's going to clear at a price. Uh we may or may not like that price, but prices used to fluctuate like all over time for various reasons.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 我的意思是，在美国内战期间，我们有一个固定的需求基础，因为如果你想成为一家银行，你就必须购买国债。然而价格仍然波动，对吧？所以对我来说，问题是：你购买证券是为了对冲一个与你所购买的资产期限相似的负债吗？你是为了长期持有吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean during the civil war, we had a captive demand base because if you wanted to be a bank, you had to buy treasuries. And yet the price moved, right? And so for me it's are you buying a security to hedge a liability that is of similar duration to the thing you're buying. Are you in it for the long haul?</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 一个经典的例子是人寿保险公司，它们拥有非常长期的、与寿命相关的负债，这是专业术语。对吧？只要人们活着，人寿保险公司就必须购买期限相似的债务，它们会非常稳定。它们可能对价格敏感，但可能程度较低。归根结底，它们有必须得到资金支持的负债。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh a classic example is like a life insurance company which has very long-term longevity indexed is the term of art. Right? It's like as long as you people are alive there's going to be life insurance companies that have to buy debt of similar length and they're going to be very stable. They might be price sensitive but probably less so. And at the end of the day, they have this liability that has to get funded.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 银行在相同程度上也有这些非常长期的负债。存款是长期负债。我想我们在其中一集节目中谈到过这一点。所以，它们需要长期资产来对冲长期负债，因为，你知道，你们都有银行账户。你们可以随时取回自己的钱，但你们通常不会这样做，对吧？所以，那是一个长期负债。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Banks to the same extent have these very long-term liabilities. Deposits are long-term liabilities. I think we talked about that on one of the episodes. So, they need long-term assets to hedge long-term liabilities because, you know, you all have bank accounts. You can get your money back whenever you want, but you tend not to, right? So, that's a long-term liability.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 对冲基金不会持有10年，因为这不是它们业务的性质。它们对价格信号和相对价值做出反应。国债交易实际上只是对价格信号的反应，市场试图找到成本最低的买家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A hedge fund is not in it for 10 years because that is not the nature of the of the business. Um, they are responding to price signals and relative value. Treasury trading is really just a response to price signals where the market is attempting to find the lowest cost buyer.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 有一本19世纪的伟大书籍，是弗里德曼（Freriedman）的灵感来源，我不是弗里德曼的信徒，但这是一个有趣的故事，这本书叫做《喂养巴黎》（Feeding Paris），作者是巴斯夏（Bastiat），一位法国经济学家。他说，如果一个人负责喂养巴黎，那么所有人都会饿死，因为如果你独自做出所有这些决定，就不可能喂饱一百万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's this great book from the 19th century which is inspiration for Freriedman. I'm not a Freeman knight but like it's an interesting story which is called Feeding Paris which is by Bastiat and a French economist and he was saying if one person was responsible for feeding Paris, everyone would die because it's impossible to feed a million people if you're making all these decisions on your own.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以价格信号让食物在需要的时候到达需要的地方。因此，价格机制的奇迹在于，巴黎每天早上醒来都有食物，而且这仍然是事实，对吧？我的意思是城市是复杂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So price signals get the food to where it has to go when it has to go there. And so like the miracle of of of the price mechanism is the fact that Paris wakes up every morning um and has food and and it's still true, right? I mean cities are complicated.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以在国债市场中，“喂养巴黎”的等价物是**基差交易**（Basis Trades: 利用现货和期货价格差异进行套利）和**掉期利差交易**（Swap Spread Trades: 利率掉期与国债收益率之间的利差交易），以及每一次使用杠杆资金（**回购**，Repo: 卖方出售证券并同意在未来某个日期以更高价格回购的短期借贷）购买证券并用衍生品对冲风险的情况，这些交易中的价格差异使其值得进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the the in the Treasury market case, the the feeding Paris equivalent is basis trades and swap spread trades and every every instance of buying a security with levered money repo and things like that and hedging the risk with the derivative where the price difference between those things makes that worthwhile.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 这也表明我们没有足够的长期负债对冲者。我们必须寻找其他人。我们应该关注哪些数据点？因为如果我查看10年期收益率，它与货币政策的长期轨迹有关，这会因为通胀、增长等各种原因而波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's also a signal that we don't have enough of those liability hedgers who are in it for the long haul. We have to find somebody else. What are the data points we should be looking at? Because if I look at the 10-year yield, you know, it's something to do with the long-term trajectory of monetary policy and that's going to fluctuate for various reasons, inflation growth, etc.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 如果我们想捕捉其他一些动态，比如买家构成或仅仅是持有美元计价债务资产的意愿变化，我们还应该关注什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we want to capture some of these other dynamics such as the change in who are the buyers or the just the desire to even own US dollar denominated debt assets, what should what else should we be looking at?</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 嗯，我这样看待美国国债，假设没有真正的信用风险，对吧？我仍然会认为，目前10年期国债收益率中嵌入的信用风险不会超过几个基点。那么10年期国债，我再次强调，我这样看待它，它必须在**名义GDP增长**（Nominal GDP Growth: 未经通胀调整的经济总产出增长率）附近。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so so the way that I look at US treasuries, assuming that there's not real credit risk, right? And I would I would still I would still argue that there's still not credit risk more than a couple of basis points that's embedded in the the current yield of say the 10-year Treasury. Then 10-year treasuries the again the way that I look at it it have to be somewhere around nominal GDP growth.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以基本上是这个国家长期增长率的轨迹，这就是市场会吐出的结果，加上或减去你所说的某种流动性溢价或折价。现在，我认为对于国债，正如Josh刚才所说，拥有深度流动性融资市场和深度流动性衍生品市场的市场，为了对冲风险，往往会获得更好的结果和更低的收益率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right so basically at the trajectory of what is the growth rate of the country in the longer run and that's what the market is going to spit out plus or minus like you said some kind of liquidity or either premium or discount. Now, I would argue that with treasuries, to Josh's point right there, is that markets that have deep liquid funding markets, deep liquid derivatives markets, in order for someone to hedge that risk, you tend to get better outcomes and lower yields because of that.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以，你知道，我们做了一项研究。我实际上在瑞信（Credit Swiss）工作时，为世界银行（World Bank）的一项研究做了一些工作，内容是关于世界上几乎所有**OECD**（Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: 经济合作与发展组织）成员国政府债券市场的流动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, we did a study. I actually um when I was back at Credit Swiss, I did something actually for the for a World Bank study about what is liquidity in just about every single OECD government bond market in the in the world.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 你得出的结论是，当你有深度和流动性的融资市场，比如**回购市场**（Repo Market: 银行和其他金融机构通过出售和回购证券进行短期借贷的市场），以及当你有衍生品市场时，买卖价差是最窄的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what you determined is bid offers were tightest when you had deep and liquid funding markets like repo and when you had derivative markets.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以你看看意大利，它基本上没有一个特别深厚和流动性的衍生品市场，而法国和西班牙则有。所以西班牙的利差实际上比意大利的利差要窄。嗯，这并不是说收益率水平可能相同，但不同之处在于那些深度流动性的辅助市场很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you you look at Italy that basically didn't have a derivative market that was particularly deep and liquid versus a France which did and a Spain that did actually. So so Spanish spreads were actually tighter than Italian spreads. Um, not that the yield levels might have been the same, but but the the difference is those deep liquid like ancillary markets around things matter.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 这就是美国与世界上任何其他国家不同的地方，因为我们拥有所有这些丰富的条件，而其他很少有市场拥有。我认为这就是为什么人们很难不参与国债市场，无论是作为负债管理工具还是交易工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's where the US is unlike any other country in the world because we have all of those things in abundance that very few other markets have, you know, and and I think that's one reason why it's going to be difficult for people not to be involved with treasuries either as a liability management tool or as a trading in instrument.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，Nelly，请说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, well, oh, Nelly, please.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 我只是想强调一下，你知道，从长期来看，如何看待收益率，长期名义GDP增长，但这种增长存在很多不确定性，而且它会波动。所以如果你对通胀不确定，即使你有一个预期的通胀路径，如果它很高，它可能会更不稳定，或者如果你对任何政策不确定，无论是你是否会支持美元，或者你是否会支持美国作为避险资产，或者你是否会支持债务或试图减少债务，这都会增加不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was just going to add I think just to emphasize you know it is long-term how to think about yields long-term nominal GDP growth but there's a lot of uncertainty about that growth and that comes and you know that fluctuates and so if you're uncertain about inflation even if you have an expected path of inflation if it's high it might be more volatile or if you're uncertain about policies any kind of policy either you know whether you're going to support the dollar or you're going to support the US as a safe haven or you're going to support debt or try to reduce debt that adds uncertainty.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 所以国债，你知道，从长远来看，它是名义GDP，但在此期间，你会根据这种不确定性的大小，波动我们所说的溢价或折价。我倾向于认为目前存在相当大的不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then treasuries you know like in long long run it is nominal GDP but in the meantime you're kind of going to fluctuate what these we call premiums or discounts you know depending on how much uncertainty there is about that I tend to think there's a fair amount of uncertainty about that right now.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 你能说服Joe，**期限溢价**（Term Premium: 投资者持有长期债券而非短期债券所要求的额外补偿）是真实存在的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you convince Joe that there is such a thing as the term premium?</p>
</details>

### 期限溢价：国债市场的“暗物质”

**Nelly Lang:** 嗯，是的，因为如果你将期限溢价定义为**预期假说**（Expectations Hypothesis: 长期利率是未来短期利率预期的平均值）减去当前收益率，那么就有一个残差，那就是期限溢价。然后你尝试用你所了解的事物来解释这个残差，但总会有一些东西留下，对我来说，这在经验上就是期限溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, yes because so because if you define term premium as the expectations hypothesis less whatever the current yield is there's a residual and that is a term premium. Then you just try to define you try to use things you know about to explain the residual but there's always something left and that to me is a term premium empirically.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 经验上，我不知道我是否能说服你，但我认为我实际上在彭博电台（Bloomberg radio）上称它为国债市场的“暗物质”，对吧？期限溢价必须存在。问题是，我们是否正确地衡量它，对吧？这就是它的艺术性，而不是期限溢价的科学性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I empirically I don't know if I'm going to convince you, but I think I called it on uh Bloomberg radio actually. I called it the uh the dark matter of um of the Treasury market, right? That term premium must exist. The question is, do we measure it properly, right? That and and that's the art of it as opposed to the science of of term premium.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以我喜欢最简单的方法，就是问人们他们认为长期短期利率会是多少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I like the easiest possible way to do this, which is just to ask people what they think short rates are going to be over the long run.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。以及明天的长期利率会是多少。费城联储（Philly Fed）每季度都会这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And what long-term rates are going to be tomorrow. And the Philly Fed does this every quarter.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 费城联储。好的，更多。所以他们只是请经济学家预测他们认为这将如何或那将如何。其中有通胀和GDP增长以及所有这些其他因素。但每年一次，我想是第一季度，所以我们现在或很快就会得到。他们会询问10年期平均国库券收益率，然后他们还会询问10年期收益率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Philly Fed. Okay, same more. So they just ask economists to make predictions as to what they think this that or the other thing are going to do. And there's like inflation and GDP growth and all these other things. But once a year, I think the first quarter, so we probably get that either now or soon. They ask 10ear average T bill yields and then they also ask about the tenure yield.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以你实际上只是在问人们，这些模型上可以添加很多花哨的东西。有些带有花哨东西的模型包含了调查数据。有些人只看调查数据。有些人只做建模，但在所有这些情况下，都有一个残差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you're just literally asking people there's a lot of bells and whistles you can put on these models. And some of the models with bells and whistles incorporate the survey data. Some people just look only at the survey data. Some people do just the modeling, but in all these cases, there's a residual.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，这并不意味着它是正的，这是真正关键的一点。期限溢价可以是负的，你可以明白为什么我不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, doesn't mean it's positive is the really key thing. Turner term premium can be negative, which you can see why I'm unsatisfied.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 是的。就是这样。它是暗物质。他们进行这些调查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Like this is the thing. It's dark matter. They ask these surveys.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。这并没有真正像他们问的随机调查一样。有时它会变成负数。你可以明白为什么我会持怀疑态度。我对此并不完全满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Which doesn't really like they ask this they ask a random survey. Sometimes it gets negative. Like you can see why like I'm skeptical. Like I'm not totally satisfied by any of this.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 不，但是两年期收益率和十年期收益率之间存在差异。所以这个差异也是真实的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, but there's a difference between the two-year yield and the 10-year yield. So therefore that difference also true.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，那可能是两年到十年之间利率的预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that could be the expectations of of race between two and 10.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 但你可以写下你认为的，或者一项调查你认为的两年到十年之间的差异，通常会有一个残差，可以是正的也可以是负的，而且它通常可以被解释为与通胀预期或其他类型的不确定性相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you can write down what you think or a survey of what you think is between the two and 10 and there's usually a residual and can be positive or negative and having it can often be explained correlated with things like inflation expectations or other kinds of uncertainty.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 我可以告诉你，根据我处理暗物质和期限溢价的经验。哦，是的，Josh曾是一名真正的天体物理学家。所以两者都非常令人不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can tell you from experience with both dark matter and turn premium. Oh yeah, Josh was an actual astrophysicist. So both deeply unsatisfying.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，等等，从物理学角度来看，暗物质是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so wait, what's dark matter in the uh from the physics perspective?</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 嗯，我们不知道它是什么。我们只知道它存在。曾有人试图用各种方式来解释它，比如试图坚持我们旧有的思维方式，认为世界充满了我们可以触摸和看到的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we don't know what it is. We just know it's there. Uh there were attempts to explain it away in various like trying to hang on to the old way we think about the world is full of stuff that we can touch and see.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 是的。但那些从未奏效，而且它太多了。然后别让我谈论暗能量，那是相反的，对吧？所以，多年前我为霍普金斯大学（Hopkins）的一位同事工作，他的博士论文被要求证实其他实验来测量宇宙的大小和形状。其中一部分是称量它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But those never worked and there's just too much of it. Um and then don't get me started on dark energy which is the opposite, right? And so I I I worked for uh for someone at Hopkins years ago who for his his PhD thesis he was told to confirm other experiments to measure the size and shape of the universe. And part of that was weighing it.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以他使用超新星做了那个实验，这是一种不同的方法。有很多不同的方法可以做事情。他得到了一个负数。非常不满意。宇宙的负质量密度，你立刻会说，好吧，这真是浪费。我为什么要花两年时间做这个？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so he did that experiment using supernovings which is a different way to do this. Lots of different ways to do things. Got a negative number. Super unsatisfying. Negative mass density of the universe which you immediately you'd say like okay well this was a waste. Why did I spend two years doing this?</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 相反，他继续研究，结果发现它非常真实，他因此获得了诺贝尔奖。我并不是说期限溢价模型会带来诺贝尔奖，但有时那些非常令人不满意的事情，你越深入挖掘，就越真实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">instead he ran with it and it turned out it was super real and he got a Nobel Prize from that outcome which I'm not saying will come from term premium modless but but sometimes the deeply unsatisfying thing is the more you dig into it the more it's real.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 我认为无论你如何分析这些信息，无论是直接询问人们，还是试图以某种极其复杂的方式模拟市场所告诉你的，你总是会得到一个残差。现在问题是，这个期限溢价告诉你什么？你能否找到一致的方法来衡量和追踪它？正负值的情况显然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that any way you slice that information either literally asking people or trying to model what the market's telling you in some super sophisticated way you always come up with a residual now the question is what is that term premium telling you and can you find consistent ways to measure it and track it and there's positive negative thing is clearly the case.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 而且，你知道，有不同的微观经济学方法来解释为什么这应该或不应该成立。它真正归结为不确定性。所以，不确定性是否与收益率相关？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know there's different microeconomic ways to explain why that should or should not be true. It really comes down to uncertainty. So and is the uncertainty correlated with yields.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以，如果我不知道未来经济会发生什么，当利率上升或下降时，这种不确定性是更大还是更小？这自然会产生这些错位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I don't know what's going to happen in the future to the economy, is that uncertainty greater or lesser when the rates go up or down? And that naturally generates these dislocations.</p>
</details>

### 债券义警：是神话还是现实？

**Tracy Aloway:** 你能谈谈另一种存在，那就是**债券义警**（Bond Vigilantes: 指那些通过抛售债券来惩罚政府财政不负责任行为的投资者）吗？我们刚刚听到Taleb谈论赤字。然而，我觉得那种认为投资者会有一天早上醒来说：“哦，等等。我真的担心赤字。今天就是我要卖掉所有债券头寸的日子。”这种想法可能不常发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you talk about the existence of something else which is bond vigilantes? So, we just we just heard Taleb talk about the deficit. And yet, I feel like the notion that there are investors that, you know, wake up one morning and say, "Oh, wait. I'm really worried about the deficit. Today's the day I'm going to, you know, sell all my bond exposure." That probably doesn't happen that often.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 其次，Nelly，我非常想听听你的看法，但你知道，当你在财政部工作时，你是否坐在办公室里想：“哦，债券义警要来抓我了。我最好在发行计划上保持纪律。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then secondly, Nelly, I would be very interested in your take on this, but you know, when you were at Treasury, did you sit in the office going like, "Oh, the bond vigilantes are going to get me. I better be disciplined with my issuance schedule.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 嗯，这是问我还是问大家？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, was that a question for me or for everyone?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 所有人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 好的。让我说一下，不，我没有那样想。在去财政部之前，我在美联储（Fed）工作了30年。你确实非常关心债券收益率。我的意思是，它对货币政策的运作方式是根本性的。它对你发行国债的方式是根本性的，但你不会每天都考虑它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, let me just No, I didn't sit there with with that. And I was at the Fed for 30 years before I went to Treasury. And you do care a lot about bond yields. I mean, it's sort of fundamental to the way monetary policy works. It's fundamental to the way you issue treasuries, but you don't think about it on a daily basis.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 但它确实会影响你如何看待这些稀有事件。如果这些，你知道，你没有预料到的冲击——根据定义你不会预料到——但如果你的系统中有大量杠杆，并且你遇到了一个意想不到的冲击，人们就会进行交易并改变头寸，那时你才会担心，但这并不是一个持续的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it really influences how you view events like these scarce events and if um these like you know shocks that you weren't which by definition you're not expecting but if you've got a system where there's a lot of leverage and you have an unexpected shock people are going to make trades and change positions and that's when you worry but it's not an ongoing thing.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 所以为了防止这类事情发生，作为政策制定者，你会花大量时间去了解杠杆在哪里，以及如何保持其可控性，并确保他们能够保持其融资。这涉及到融资对于能够交易国债的重要性。所以这是一个更大的图景，但它不是每天都在发生的事情。我不是这样认为的，但它很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So those kinds of to sort of prevent that you spend a lot of time as a policy maker where do we understand where the leverage is and how can we keep it manageable and make sure they can keep their funding. This is gets to the point the funding being you know fundamental to being able to trade treasuries. So it's kind of a bigger picture but it's not a daily thing. I don't but um but it's important.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 我实际上认为这是一个非常重要的市场纪律机制。是的。债务水平很重要，对吧？所以，债券义警，没有一群人会聚在酒吧里说：“嘿，我们要去卖国债。今天就是这一天。”是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually think it's a really important market disciplining mechanism. Yeah. The level of debt matters, right? So the the bod finchelantes, like there's no group of people who get together at a bar and say, hey, we're going to go sell treasuries. Today's the day. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 就像，“嘿，明天，你知道，债务会变得太大。我们只是卖掉国债。”我认为，这个问题以多种方式表现出来。其中之一就是我们所看到的**收益率曲线陡峭化**（Steepening of the Yield Curve: 长期债券收益率与短期债券收益率之差扩大），对吧？在正常环境下，如果美联储预计会降息，你也会预期到这一点，这当然已经发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like like, hey, tomorrow, you know, the debt is going to be too big. Let's just sell treasuries. The the issue, I think, is manifests itself in multiple ways. And one is this the steepening of the yield curve that we've seen, right? in a in a normal environment. You'd expect that anyway if the Federal Reserve was expected to cut rates, which it certainly has.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 但与此同时，你知道，你确实越来越担心，当你每年有两万亿、两万五千亿美元的赤字时，我们最终会陷入**债务陷阱**（Debt Trap: 债务利息支出过高，导致政府难以偿还本金或进行其他必要开支），债务利息支出变得如此之大，以至于华盛顿的财政官员将不得不采取措施。但市场尚未迫使他们这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at the same time, you know, you do have a growing fear that when you have two trillion, $2.5 trillion deficits every year and we wind up in a in a in a debt trap where interest rates and the interest on the debt ends up being so large that the fiscal agents in Washington will have to do something about it. but the market hasn't yet forced them into it.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 我认为这种强制，这种迫使政府实际采取行动的做法，可能才是你真正获得某种财政回应的动力。挑战在于政治，对吧？那是因为我们联邦政府超过50%的支出是医疗保险、社会保障和债务利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and I think that that's that forcing um that forcing the government to actually act and do something is really what might have to be the impetus for you to actually get some kind of fiscal response. The challenge is political, right? And and that is because 50 plus% of our debt is interest of excuse me of our spending by the federal government is Medicare, Social Security, and interest on the debt.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 嗯，这些都是难以应对的事情，对吧？真的非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, those are hard things to contend with, right? It's really, really difficult.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以我相信债券义警，但不是在美国背景下。我的意思是，当我们谈论债券义警时，我们指的是90年代的**新兴市场危机**（EM Crisis: 90年代亚洲、拉美等地发生的金融危机），当时人们担心我拿不回我的美元。它们是美元债券。我拿不回这些美元，因为这笔债务的对手方没有它们，也无法以合理的价格获得它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I I believe in bond vigilantes, is not in a US context. And what I mean by that is when we talk about bond vigilantes, we're really referring to the '9s em crisis where the concern was I'm not going to get my dollar. They were dollar bonds. I'm not going to get these dollars back because the counterparty to this debt doesn't have them and can't get them at a reasonable price.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 所以债券会违约，因此我想在违约发生之前抢先一步，因为，你知道，经典的银行挤兑。我想在其他人之前退出，以免被困住。在美国背景下，你没有这个问题。所以问题是谁会醒来并出售，以及为什么？我再说一遍为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, the bond will default and therefore I want to get ahead of this default because, you know, the classic bank run. and I want to get out before everyone else is before I'm stuck. In the US context, you don't have that problem. So, the question is who's going to wake up and sell and why? I'm saying why again.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 他们会出售，因为他们被迫出售。我们有**回购义警**（Repo Vigilantes: 指回购市场参与者因市场流动性或杠杆问题被迫出售资产），可以说，在2020年和2025年都曾出现。他们因为各种原因被迫出售。其中一个原因就是市场整体波动性的增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and they will sell because they are forced to sell. And we've had the repo vigilantes, so to speak, strike in 2020 and in 2025. And they were forced to sell for a variety of reasons. One was just the increase in the volatility of the market in general.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 然后是追加保证金通知，尤其是在2020年，他们被去杠杆化了。然后问题就变成了我们是否正走向那种情景？债务增长之所以重要，是因为这些回购义警不担心他们持有的债券的信用风险。他们担心没有人会从他们那里购买，因为银行系统或交易商，即与银行关联的交易商，本应是这些交易的另一方，将没有能力，每笔交易都会变得越来越便宜，他们将陷入一种困难的**市值重估**（Mark-to-Market: 资产或负债按当前市场价格进行估值）状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then there were margin calls especially in 2020 where they were delevered. Um and the uh the the the question then becomes like are we heading for that kind of scenario? And the reason why the debt growth matters is because these repo vigilantes are not worried about the credit of the bonds they hold. They're worried no one will buy them from them because the banking system or the dealer, the bank affiliated dealers that are be supposed to be on the other side of these trades won't have capacity and every trade's going to keep ticking cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and they're going to be in a difficult like sort of marktomarket situation.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 但那是一套非常不同的考虑因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's a very different set of considerations.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的。这与债务的整体增长有关，但也与市场的结构以及它如何安置债务有关。既然我们在这里，我只是想澄清一些我多年来一直想了解的事情，十多年来，我一直坐在我的彭博终端前。每隔一段时间，你就会看到一个红色标题，谈论像“尾部”的**投标覆盖率**（Bid-to-Cover: 拍卖中收到的总投标量与待售证券量之比）。我从来都无法判断这些拍卖统计数据是否真的有什么不同。比如，“哦，糟糕的拍卖”然后又变成了“一次好的拍卖”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And it's sort of related to overall growth in the debt, but it's also related to the structure of the market and how it places it. Since we're here and we're just clarifying things for me that I've always wanted to, you know, learn about for years, over 10 years, I've been sitting at my Bloomberg terminal. Every once in a while you get a red headline and it talks about like bid to cover in the tail and I can never tell if any of these auction statistics really make a difference. Like, oh, terrible auction and then it was a good auction.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我应该如何解读这些信息？它有多大用处？或者对谁有用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What how should I consume that information? How useful is that? Or for whom is that useful?</p>
</details>

### 国债拍卖数据与市场结构变化

**Ira Jersey:** 嗯，我们实际上今年早些时候在彭博资讯（Bloomberg Intelligence）开始了一套评级方法，我们将这些拍卖从D级评到A+级。我们查看各种投标指标来做到这一点，以及它们与近期历史的比较。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so so so we actually started just earlier this year in Bloomberg Intelligence having a grading methodology where we actually grade these from D to A plus and you know we we we look at a variety of the bidding metrics in order to do that and and how they compare to recent history.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以你看到的一个大问题，这涉及到Josh提到的结构问题。你回到大约10到12年前，你会看到**一级交易商**（Primary Dealers: 获准直接与美联储进行交易的金融机构）是息票债券的最大买家。今天，他们是最小的买家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the big things that you've seen and this goes to Josh's thing uh issues about structure. you go back about 10 12 years and you saw that primary dealers were the biggest buyers of coupon uh coupon debt. Today they're the smallest.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以你实际上在最近的拍卖中，例如我们本周刚刚进行的拍卖，我们今天早些时候进行了一次七年期拍卖，昨天是五年期。交易商只购买了大约10%的债券，而如果你回到2012年、2013年，他们会购买这些拍卖的40%到60%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you actually in the recent auctions for example that we just had this this week uh we did a seven-year auction earlier today we had five year yesterday. Um the uh dealers only bought about 10% of the bonds whereas if you went back to 2012 2013 it would have been they would have bought 40 to 60% of those auctions.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以投标指标很重要，因为它能让你看到主要需求来自哪里。我们现在知道，由于市场结构的变化，特别是在**巴塞尔协议III**（Basil III: 一套全球银行监管标准，旨在加强银行资本充足率、流动性和杠杆率）实施以来，交易商的购买量要小得多，而最终用户是更大的买家。其中一些是**高频交易员**（High-Frequency Traders - HFTs: 利用高速计算机程序在极短时间内执行大量交易的交易者），或者可能是那些有回购账簿并需要通过获取一些抵押品来填补的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the bidding metrics matter and it matters because you can see where the primary demand is coming from. And we know now that you know dealers because of the changes in market structure that have occurred particularly since the institution of Basil 3 are are much smaller buyers and and you know basically end users are much larger buyers and and some of those are high frequency traders or maybe people who have repo books and kind of need to fill them by by getting some collateral.</p>
</details>

**Ira Jersey:** 所以所有这些投标指标都很重要，但**尾部**（Tail: 拍卖中最高接受收益率与拍卖前市场收益率之间的差异）会告诉你，在拍卖结束时市场定价错误，与该拍卖的总需求相比。那个尾部是唯一最重要的东西，其次是其中关于谁实际购买以及他们出价多少的一些细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of those bidding metrics matter, but the tails will show you that the market was mispriced at the time that the auction closed versus what the aggregate demand was at that auction. And that's that tail is the single most important thing to look at followed by then some of the details in there about who was actually purchasing and then u you know how much they bid for.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 既然我们提到了市场结构，国债市场确实经历了一些波动事件，这很奇怪，因为理论上，它应该是一个相当无聊、稳定、老式的市场，但它却并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, since we brought up market structure, it is true that the Treasury market has experienced a number of volatility events at this point, which is weird because in theory, it's supposed to be a pretty boring kind of stayed old-fashioned market and it's been anything but.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 你是说我一直很无聊。我很抱歉。我很抱歉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're telling me that I'm I've been boring. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，现在不是了。这是个好消息。它本应如此。嗯，我们有所有这些在每次波动事件后实施的措施，比如**隔夜逆回购协议**（RRP: Overnight Reverse Repo Program: 美联储向合格对手方出售证券并同意次日回购的工具，用于吸收市场流动性）、**常备回购便利**（Standing Repo Facility: 美联储向合格对手方提供隔夜回购交易的工具，以缓解短期融资市场压力）。我们刚刚修改了**补充杠杆率**（Supplementary Leverage Ratio - SLR: 一项银行监管规定，要求银行持有一定比例的资本以应对风险），以帮助交易银行持有更多国债。为什么我们似乎仍然会发生这些波动事件？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, not anymore. That's the good news. It's supposed to be supposed to be. Um, and we have all these things that have been put in place after every single volatility event like, you know, the RRP, the standing repo facility. We just had a change to the supplementary leverage ratio to help dealer banks hold more treasuries. Why do we still seem to have these V events happening?</p>
</details>

### 波动性事件与市场流动性

**Josh Younger:** 我想我们有时应该有它们。所以，认为国债市场从未发生过事件的想法。我的意思是，回到90年代，有大规模的波动事件，比如2003年。有大规模的抵押贷款展期。有一次意外的75个基点加息。所以这些事件一直都存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess my we should have them sometimes. So, the idea that treasury markets never had events. I mean, go back to the 90s and there were massive V events in like 2003. there's a massive mortgage extension. There was a surprise 75 basis point hike in the night. So, there's always been these events.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 我认为现在的区别在于，很难 pinpoint 一个根本来源。通常在过去，你可以说：“哦，这是全球金融危机，这是美联储以人们意想不到的方式加息。”现在，有一个试图弄清楚为什么会发生这种情况的整个过程，而且它往往发生得非常快，并且往往会扰乱很多关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the the difference now is it's harder to pinpoint a fundamental source. Like usually back then you could say, "Oh, this was the GSC's this was the Fed hiking rates in a way that people didn't expect. Now there's like this whole like process of trying to figure out why this is happening and and it it tends to um happen very quickly and it tends to disrupt a lot of relationships."</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 但我认为从某种意义上说，这些事情过去一直在发生。只是市场规模大得多。银行系统提供这种抵消的能力较弱。而且交易发生的频率确实大大增加了。我的意思是，现在市场非常活跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like I I think in one sense this is stuff that's been happening in the past. It's just the market is much larger. The banking system's ability to provide that offset is is is lesser. Um and uh the the the the frequency with which trades happen just really gone up. I mean like the markets are very active now.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 但我认为这都是问题的症状，那就是它有点像国债市场的“即时供应”版本，即交易商无法持有大量库存。所以他们必须非常高效地匹配交易。过去，如果你不知道买家和卖家，你只需隔夜持有。现在，高频交易员以非常高效、快节奏的方式为他们做这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think that's all kind of a symptom of the issue which is it's kind of like a just in time supply version of treasury markets which is you have dealers can't hold a lot of inventory. So they have to match trades really efficiently. It used to be if you didn't know the buyer and the seller, you just hold it overnight. Now the high frequency traders do that for them in a very efficient fast-paced way.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 然后**交易商**（Dealers: 在金融市场中买卖证券以赚取差价的机构，通常也扮演做市商角色）试图通过价格机制让对冲基金持有库存，因为基差交易基本上就是交易商过去所做的事情。而这一切都非常脆弱。所以这些因素的结合产生了这些冲击，因为整个安排可能会非常迅速地崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the dealers are trying to get hedge funds and through the price mechanism to hold inventory on their behalf because basis trades are basically what dealers used to do. And that's all very fragile. And so that combination of things generates these shocks because the whole that arrangement can collapse very quickly.</p>
</details>

**Josh Younger:** 但你知道，归根结底，市场规模增长得更快。是的。比交易商能够利用的容量增长得更快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you know at the end of the day like the the size of the market is growing faster. Yeah. than the dealers have capacity to to use.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 是的。我只是想从政策制定者的角度提供一些看法，就像如果你退一步看，技术发生了如此多的变化，然后是买家基础的变化。我们谈到了现在和过去谁购买的结构性变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nelly. Yeah. I just to provide like a policy makers perspective like if you just step back there's just been so many changes in technology and then the changes in the buyer base. We talked about the structural change on who buys now versus then.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 所以，在2014年，发生了一件叫做国债**闪电暴跌**（Flash Rally: 市场在极短时间内出现剧烈价格波动，然后迅速反转的现象）的事情。我记得那个。你还记得吗？没有人明白为什么国债收益率在2分钟内上下波动了30个基点然后又反转了，这有点吓到了公共部门，你知道，政府官员会想：这怎么可能？这是什么交易？这与这些新的高频交易员有很大关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like in 2014 there was something called a flash rally in the trade. I remember that. Remember and like no one understood why the Treasury yield went up and down like 30 basis points in 2 minutes and reversed and it was it kind of scared the public sector, you know, the government officials like how is this possible? What is the trade and had to do a lot with these new highfrequency traders?</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 花了很多时间才弄清楚发生了什么。所以那甚至是在有很多国债之前。现在我们有更多的国债，而且数量也很大。但我想我也会区分波动事件和市场**非流动性**（Illiquidity: 资产难以快速买卖而不影响其价格的状态）事件，只是因为如果新闻是波动的，经济发生了新的变化，你会预期国债收益率和价格也会波动。它们应该如此。它们应该反映这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It took a lot of time to like dissect what happened. So that was even before there was a lot of treasury debt. Now we have more treasury debt and there's just you know the volume. But I guess I would also separate the I would make a distinction between volatility events and then market illiquidity events just because if the mark if news is volatile, there's new changes in the economy, you would expect Treasury yields and prices to be volatile. They should. They're supposed to reflect that.</p>
</details>

**Nelly Lang:** 我认为最近发生的大部分情况都是如此。但令人担忧的是，当你无法轻松快速地进行交易时，因为你吸引了比平时更多的交易商，只是因为波动性更高。所以你总是会得到一点，嗯，当事情变得波动时，你总是会得到一点较少的流动性，你知道，只是因为风险更高，但当他们停止**做市**（Making Markets: 交易商准备好买卖证券以提供流动性）或停止报价或其他事情时，你就无法实际进行交易，这些才是政策制定者真正关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think a lot of what's been happening recently. But the concerns are when you can't transact easily and quickly because you've pulled in more dealers pulled in more than they might normally would just because of the higher volatility. So you you should always get a little well you should always get a little less liquidity when things get volatile you know just because risk is higher but it's when they sort of stop making markets or stop posting or something then and you can't actually transact those are the things that the policy makers really care about.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 这有一个平衡点，我们希望国债市场是深度和流动性的。深度流动性意味着交易成本低廉，这意味着交易商每笔交易赚的钱不多。所以老笑话是“我们正在亏损，但我们将通过交易量来弥补”，类似这样的事情，希望不是那样。

<p class="english-text">it it there's there's this balancing thing where we want treasure marks to be deep and liquid. Deep liquid means it's inexpensive to transact which means the dealers don't make much money per trade. So the old joke like we're making losses but we'll make up for it in volume kind of thing and like hopefully not that but the the uh the respon if you want low transaction costs the the way you get that and still have functioning businesses leverage.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 这75年来，自从财政部和美联储出现以来，这一直是核心问题。所以当你对银行施加杠杆限制时，即使银行没有杠杆限制，当交易台有杠杆限制时，当杠杆在机构内部是零和游戏时，这有点像这些杠杆率的作用，每个人都在争夺相同的资源，这个过程引入了摩擦。

<p class="english-text">And this this has been the case for you know 75 years since the Treasury Fed that this was always the core issue and so when you leverage constrain banks and even if the bank isn't leverage constrained when the desk is leverage constrained when leverage is a zero sum game within the institution which is kind of what these leverage ratios do everyone's fighting over the same resource and that process introduces friction.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 归根结底，我认为这些波动事件大多只是时间上的滞后，就像如果你不得不思考太久，市场可能会离你而去。所以，你知道，在2020年，如果你不得不花两天时间来弄清楚谁获得了增量资产负债表，那么在2020年3月的两天内可能会发生很多事情。这些非常人性化的经历是推动事物发展的原因。

<p class="english-text">And at the end of the day I think these V events are mostly just time slippage like if you have to think about things for too long the market can run away from you so you know in 2020 if you had to spend two days figuring out who gets incremental balance sheet a lot can happen in two days in March of 2020 and and and these very human experiences are kind of what drive uh the thing.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 我们在4月底的节目中谈到了4月份的事件，时间上的滞后正是当时发生的一个大问题，就在你4月9日睡着之前，对吧？那是因为，你看，你不能在纽约时间晚上11点半打电话给纽约的交易台，要求更多的交易商资产负债表，而你却在香港进行交易，对吧？这样做很难。

<p class="english-text">And we talked about this on on the show that we did back in uh in late April about the April event and that time slippage is exactly a big thing part of what happened when when right before you fell asleep on on April 9th, right? Um it's because like look, you you can't call the New York dealer desk to get more dealer balance sheet at 11:30 at night New York time um when you're trading in Hong Kong, right? It's it's just hard to do that.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 所以你会遇到这些波动事件，它们会造成非流动性市场，但只在特定的时间点，对吧？然后这总是会被套利掉。你知道，人们，归根结底，我们绝对不是价格接受者，对吧？有很多人，你知道，基本上希望他们的资产价格能够反映他们正在承担的风险。

<p class="english-text">So So you get these VA events that that are create illquid markets but only at certain points in time, right? Right. And and then that always gets arbed away. You know, people are are, you know, at the end of the day, we're we're definitely not price takers, right? There's a lot of people who are um you know, basically want the price of their of the asset to reflect the risk that they're taking.</p>

**Josh Younger:** 所以，当你遇到新闻事件，当你从唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）那里得到一个头条新闻，你认为美元可能不再是储备货币时，这会影响全球范围内的美元资产，无论它们在哪里。

<p class="english-text">And so, you're going to get these instantaneous shifts in expectations. When you get a news event, when you get a headline from, you know, Donald Trump and you think that maybe the dollar is not going to be the reserve currency anymore, that's going to affect dollar assets regardless of where they are in the world.</p>
