title: 揭秘嗅觉与气流：从犬鼻到法医科学的痕迹检测技术
---

### 犬类嗅觉的科学奥秘与痕迹检测的起源

在美国政府的这个实验室里，研究人员通过研究气流来侦破案件。他们利用镜子、灯光和激光，能够照亮空气温度和密度最微小的差异，并追踪毒品粉末如何在房屋房间内沉降，确定是哪个人开了枪，或者发现从密封包裹中逸出的微粒。本视频的一部分由Lutron的Caseta赞助。几个世纪以来，我们用于检测微量物质的最佳工具始终如一。

<p class="english-text">In this US Government lab, they study air flow to solve crimes, using mirrors, lights and lasers, they can illuminate the tiniest differences in air temperature and density, and track how drug powder settles in the rooms of a house, determine which person fired a gun, or spot particles escaping from a sealed package. A portion of this video was sponsored by Caseta by Lutron. Our best tool for picking up trace substances has been the same for centuries.</p>

事实证明，大自然已经为我们提供了最好的化学探测器，那就是狗的鼻子。这是“泡泡”，一个3D打印的、解剖结构精确的雌性拉布拉多寻回犬模型。我们曾试图让一只警犬来到这里，站在镜子前，但狗很快就会又饿又暴躁。我们只得到了大约四秒钟的好镜头，我就觉得，好吧，我们可以做得更好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So it turns out nature has already provided us with the best chemical detector, and that is the dog's nose. So this is Bubbles. She's a 3D-printed, anatomically-correct model of a female Labrador Retriever. We tried to get one of the police canines to come in here and get in front of the mirror, but dogs get hungry and cranky very quickly. And we got about four seconds of good footage, and I'm like, okay, we can do better than this.</p>
</details>

狗能够嗅探到非常微弱和遥远的气味，但它们并非仅仅通过吸气来做到这一点。它们以每秒大约五次的频率快速呼气和吸气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dogs can sniff very faint scents and from far away, but they don't do it just by breathing in. What they do is breathe out and in rapidly around five times a second. (air whizzing)</p>
</details>

我希望你注意到这个脉动运动，我们称之为“狗零食”，对吗？这就是我们的狗零食。如果你注意到这个脉动运动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I want you to notice is this pulsating motion by the, we'll call it the doggy treat, right? This is our doggy treat. If you notice this pulsating motion.</p>
</details>

而让它们能够从远处探测到气味的原因是快速而湍急的呼气。当狗呼气时，每个鼻孔都会喷出湍急的气流，就像你我呼气时一样。如果你把手放在鼻子下面呼气，那也是两股湍急的气流从狗的鼻子里出来。但当狗趴在地上时，这些气流会向后方引导。狗将空气向后推，通过这样做，它会从前方吸入空气。所以想象一下我，我这样吹气，当我这样做时，我实际上会伸出手将空气拉向我。狗会反向吸气，对吗？获取新的样本，然后用它上方惊人的化学探测器——它的**嗅觉区域**（Olfactory Region: 负责嗅觉的脑部区域）——进行分析，而且每秒进行五次。平均而言，狗在嗅探东西时，每秒五次的重复正弦波。这就是狗成为这种不可思议的采样系统的原因。犬种似乎并不重要。它们的进化以某种方式让它们明白了，好的，每五分之一秒是我在下一次吸气前需要的时间。如果狗有无限的肺活量，并且它只是不断吸气，它的探测范围会非常有限。但由于这种进出式的**风箱效应**（Bellows Effect: 像风箱一样通过压缩和膨胀来移动空气），它的探测范围大约增加了18倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what allows them to detect scents from far away is the rapid and turbulent exhale. When the dog exhales, there's a turbulent air jet that comes out of each nostril, just like when you and I exhale. If you put your hand under here and just exhale outta your nose, those are two turbulent air jets coming out of the dog's nose. But when the dog is down on the ground, those air jets are vectored back towards its rear. The dog is pushing air back, and when by doing that, it's pulling air from ahead of it. So imagine me, I'm blowing air this way, and when I do that, I actually reach out and pull air towards me. The dog reverses flow inhales, right? Gets a new sample, analyzes it with an amazing chemical detector upstairs, right? Its olfactory region, and does it at five times a second. On average, a dog when it's sniffing for something, five times a second repetitive sine wave. So that's what makes the dog this incredible sampling system. It kind of didn't matter the breed of dog. Somehow their evolution allowed them to figure out, okay, one over five seconds is what I need before I take the next puff or the next inhale. If the dog had infinite lung capacity, and it just inhaled constantly, it has a very limited reach. But because of this in and out bellows effect, its reach goes up by roughly a factor of 18.</p>
</details>

我们有许多市售的蒸汽探测器，好吗？因为其中一些非常适合各种爆炸物和毒品，一些非常适合化学和生物危害物，但它们都只是吸入空气。我们所做的是设计并打印出本质上是鼻孔的东西，可以插到这个设备上，让它像狗一样嗅探。然后通过一系列受控实验，通过将蒸汽源移动得越来越远，我们平均能够将这些设备的检测能力提高大约16到18倍。哇！仅仅通过让它们像真正的狗一样嗅探。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a number of commercially available vapor detectors, okay? Because some of these are really good for various explosives and drugs, some are very good for chemical and biological hazards, but they all just inhale air. What we did is we designed and printed what are essentially nostrils that plug onto this thing and make it sniff like a dog. And then by doing a set of controlled experiments, by moving your vapor source farther and farther, we were able to, on average, improve the detection capabilities of these by roughly a factor of 16 to 18. Whoa! Just by making them sniff like a real dog.</p>
</details>

### 气流可视化技术：纹影成像与影图法

我们能够使用**纹影成像**（Schlieren Imaging: 一种光学技术，用于可视化流体中折射率的微小变化，常用于观察气流、热对流和冲击波）来观察狗的呼吸。我以前也做过关于这个的视频。这是一个汽车前照灯。之后，我有一个聚光镜，它将光线聚焦到一个点。所以从那里我们的光线发散，然后上来并充满我们的镜子。把这些光束想象成箭，好吗？有一束束箭向上射来，它们笔直如线，但当它们穿过折射率不同的物体时——这可能是我手上的热量，或者是密度不同的气体——那些光线就会稍微偏移，它们偏移得非常轻微，好吗？它们会折射，它们会弯曲。然后它们都回来了。所以我们回到这里，就在这里我们有一个双向镜。所以光线可以这样穿过镜子，但当它回来时，它会转90度。如果你看这里，我有一把刀片。它的作用是，它正好位于镜子的焦点上。我有那个刀片边缘，它能够在焦平面内外移动。所以我要做的就是切断那些偏移了一点点的光箭，那些光束，我把它们切断，我阻挡它们。当我把刀刃移开时，我现在没有切断任何光线，所以你基本上有一个非常昂贵的镜子，它对你没有任何作用。但当我拿起这把刀片，然后推入时，你开始看到空气中的湍流，当我推入得越来越多时，是的，你看到了，把你的手放进去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're able to see this dog breath using Schlieren imaging. I've actually done a video on this before. This is an automotive headlamp. After that, I have a condenser lens, so it takes this light and focuses it down to a point. So from there our light diverges, and it comes up and it fills our mirror. Think of these light beams as arrows, okay? And there are a bunch of arrows that are coming up, they're straight as can be, but when they pass something of a different refractive index, which could be the heat from my hand, or a different density, which could be a gas of a different density, those light rays, they shift a little bit, they shift very slightly, okay? They refract, they bend. Then they all come back. So we're coming back here, and right here we have a two-way mirror. So light can travel through the mirror this way, but when it comes back, it turns 90 degrees. And if you look right here, I have a razor blade. And what this is doing, it is positioned exactly at the focal point of that mirror. I have that razor blade edge, it's able to move in and out of the focal plane. And so what I do is I cut off those arrows of light, those beams of light that shifted a little bit, and I cut 'em off, I block 'em. As I move the knife edge out, so I'm not cutting off any light right now, so you basically have a really expensive mirror, it's not doing anything for you. But as I take this razor blade, and push it in, you start to see, you know, turbulence in the air, and as I take it more and more, yeah, there you go, get your hand in there.</p>
</details>

哇，你的纹影成像装置比我的好多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whoa, your Schlieren setup is so much better than mine.</p>
</details>

所以看看这个。这是一个**影图法**（Shadowgraph: 一种用于可视化流体流动的光学方法，通过观察光线穿过流体时产生的阴影来显示密度变化）系统。哇。所以它是纹影成像的小兄弟，好吗？它不是一个纹影成像系统，但非常接近，是一个影图法。影图法没有那么敏感，好吗？但它更容易建造。看，我们有一个手电筒和一面白墙，我们已经看到了一个影图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So take a look at this. So this is in a Shadowgraph system. Wow. So it's Schlieren's little brother, okay? It's not a Schlieren system, but it's very close, a Shadowgraph. Shadowgraph is not as sensitive, okay? But it's easier to build. Look, we have a flashlight and a white wall, and we're already seeing a shadowgraph there.</p>
</details>

那为什么会这样呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why does this work?</p>
</details>

发生的情况是，我们有光线，它不像我希望的那样聚焦，但越聚焦越好。光线这样上来，它穿过一个密度和折射率不同的热火焰，我们基本上是在墙上投射出那个羽流的阴影，这就是为什么它被称为影图法。这些仍然可以用来详细可视化流型。仅仅通过观察影图法中枪支射击的画面，我们就能实际计算出子弹的速度和枪声的响度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's happening is we have light, it's not as focused as I would like, but the more focus, the better. The light's coming up this way, it's passing through a hot flame of a different density and refractive index, and we're basically casting a shadow of that plume on the wall, which is why it's called a Shadowgraph. These can still be used to visualize flow patterns in detail. Just by looking at the footage of guns fired in a Shadowgraph, we can actually figure out the speed of the bullet and how loud the bang was.</p>
</details>

我们的子弹呼啸而出，它是超音速的，因为它有一个非常小的弓形激波。你看到了吗？是的。非常非常小。所以它大约是**马赫数**（Mach Number: 物体速度与当地声速之比，用于描述超音速运动）1.05左右，略高于音速。将其与臭名昭著的AK47突击步枪进行比较。这里我们可以定性地观察到两件事。第一，如果你将史密斯威森手枪和AK47并排比较，这条线的黑暗程度是不同的。这是一种更安静的枪械，声音没那么大，报告声也没那么响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's our bullet whizzing off, it is supersonic because it has a very small bow shock. You see it there? Yep. Very, very small. So it's, you know, roughly what Mach 1.05 maybe, just above sonic. Compare that to the infamous AK47 assault rifle. There's two things that we can qualitatively observe here. One is, if you compare these side to side, the Smith & Wesson versus the AK47, the darkness of this line is different. This is a quieter firearm, it's not as loud, the report is not as loud.</p>
</details>

因为它不那么明显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because it's less pronounced.</p>
</details>

Matt：它不那么明显，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[Matt] It's less pronounced, yep.</p>
</details>

枪支发射时释放的热气体向外膨胀，产生冲击波。穿过这个冲击波，空气的压力、温度和密度会迅速变化。这种变化越大，它在影图法中显示得就越暗。所以你可以通过冲击波的黑暗程度来判断它的响度。然后我们看到子弹以大约马赫数二，二点五的速度呼啸而出。它大概是两三度，对吧？你实际上可以测量并计算出马赫数。任何在空气中移动的物体都会产生以声速传播的压力波。由于这颗子弹的移动速度快于声速，它产生的所有压力波都会被压缩成一个单一的锥形冲击波。这就像一个微小的音爆。你可以用它来确定子弹的速度。角度的正弦值是声速与物体速度之比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The hot gases released when the gun is fired expand outwards, creating a shockwave. Across this shock, the pressure, temperature, and density of the air changes rapidly. And the bigger that change, the darker this shows up in the Shadowgraph. So you can get a sense of how loud it is by how dark that shock appears. And then here we see our bullet whizzing off at about, oh gosh, Mach two, two and a half, It's like two, three degrees, right? You could actually measure that and calculate the Mach number. Any object moving through air creates pressure waves that travel out at the speed of sound. Since this bullet is moving faster than the speed of sound, the pressure waves it creates all get compressed together into a single conical shock wave. It's like a tiny sonic boom. And you can use this to determine the speed of the bullet. The sine of the angle is the ratio of the speed of sound to the speed of the object.</p>
</details>

### 激光光片技术与法医痕迹检测

还有一种不同的可视化气流的方法，那就是使用**激光光片**（Laser Sheet: 一种将激光束展开成薄片状的技术，用于照亮流体中的粒子，从而可视化流动模式）。它能照亮微小颗粒。所以我们可以看到枪支发射时产生的火药残留物羽流。我们称之为激光光片。原因是，好的，现在我们的光线在那里，我几乎看不到它，因为我戴着激光安全眼镜。是的，我只能在相机里看到它。是的，所以这里发生的是我们有一束激光束，我们通过一个圆柱形玻璃棒引导它。它只是一块圆柱形的玻璃。它的作用是将光束展开成一个二维的激光光墙。好的？所以它的工作原理是，每当颗粒或舞台烟雾穿过这个光片时，它们就会因为激光而发光。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is a different way to visualize flow, which is with a laser sheet. It illuminates fine particles. So we can see the plumes of gun powder residue created when a gun is fired. We call this laser light sheet. And the reason is, okay, so now our light's there, I can barely see it because I have laser safety glasses on. Yep. I can only see it in the camera. Yeah, so what's happening here is we have a laser beam, and we send it, we steer it through a cylindrical glass rod. All it is, is a piece of glass that's a cylinder. And what that does is it spreads that beam into a two-dimensional wall of laser light. Okay? And so the way this works is whenever particles or theatrical fog cross through this sheet, they light up because of the laser.</p>
</details>

现在有很多努力正在投入到理解**枪击残留物**（Gunshot Residue, GSR: 枪支发射后产生的燃烧和未燃烧的推进剂颗粒）上。所以枪击残留物是枪支发射时产生的燃烧和未燃烧的推进剂。对吗？所以我们在这里看到的是利用激光和高速摄像机，我们正在观察射击事件后产生的枪击残留物羽流。这是在实际射击场内观察通风情况。但看看这一切。这些都是你肉眼看不到但确实存在的枪击残留物，所以你可以想象，如果你在家里，这是几秒钟内的五次射击。大量的物质。其中很多都落在射击者的手上，但不幸的是，很多也分散到当地环境中。它传播的范围比我预期的要远得多。所以问题是，我们能否区分射击者实际造成的痕迹和例如两分钟后走进来的旁观者造成的痕迹？这就是我们目前正在积极追求的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of effort now going into understanding gunshot residue. So gunshot residue is the kind of burned and unburned propellant that occurs whenever a firearm is discharged, right? So what we're looking at here is using laser lights and high speed cameras, is we're looking at the plume of gunshot residue that's generated after a firing event. This is looking at ventilation inside an actual gun range. But look at all this. This is all gunshot residue that you can't see with the naked eye, but is there, so you can imagine if you're inside a home, this is five shots in a few seconds. Enormous amounts of material. A lot of this is landing on the hands of the shooter, but unfortunately a lot of it is also being dispersed into the local environment. It goes way farther than I expected. So the question is, can we differentiate between something that's actually been done by the shooter and something, say, by a bystander that walked in two minutes later? So that this is what we're actively trying to pursue right now.</p>
</details>

所以这些是我们在**NIST**（National Institute of Standards and Technology: 美国国家标准与技术研究院，负责制定测量标准和技术）使用的工具和技术，它们是定性的，有时是半定量的，但它们确实有助于说明正在发生的事情。然后这方面的公共安全部分涉及痕迹违禁品检测。我们都在产生热量，对吗？所以我们都有这种温暖的空气羽流。你想看看吗？我给你看。这有点疯狂。你看到了吗？所以那被称为**人体热羽流**（Human Thermal Plume: 人体散发的热量和微粒形成的向上气流）。你猜那羽流里有什么？水？我身体的一部分。皮肤细胞。不可能。是的。所以我们以相当惊人的速度脱落皮肤细胞。我忘了具体数字是多少，但很多。每小时数千个左右。所以我们不断脱落这些皮肤细胞，从痕迹检测的角度来看，这实际上不一定是坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these are tools and techniques that we use here at NIST that are qualitative or sometimes semi-quantitative, but they really help illustrate what's happening. And then the public security part of this, deals with trace contraband detection. We're all generating heat, right? So we all have this warm plume of air. You wanna see it? I'll show you. It's kind of crazy. So you seeing it there? So that is called the human thermal plume. And guess what's in that plume? Water? Parts of me. Skin cells. No way. Yeah. So we're shedding skin cells at a pretty creepy rate. I forget what the number is, but it's a lot. Thousands an hour-ish. So we are shedding these skin cells constantly, and it's actually not necessarily a bad thing from a trace detection standpoint.</p>
</details>

你是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you mean?</p>
</details>

嗯，每当我们谈论痕迹检测时，无论是毒品还是爆炸物，都基于一个基本原则，它被称为**洛卡德交换原理**（Locard's Exchange Principle: 法医科学中的一个基本原则，指出犯罪者在犯罪现场留下痕迹，同时也会从现场带走痕迹）。它属于法医科学。它说的是每一次接触都会留下痕迹。这意味着当你完成这个实验室的工作时，你身体的一部分会留在实验室里，无论你喜欢与否，对吗？因为我们都在脱落皮肤细胞，并带走东西，带着东西离开。所以如果我是一个炸弹制造者，如果我参与在我家地下室制造非法芬太尼，我最终会用散装材料污染自己。这种污染以非常非常小的颗粒形式出现。我们现在拥有的化学检测系统非常灵敏，它们可以检测到单个爆炸物残留颗粒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, whenever we are talking about trace detection, whether it's drugs or explosives, it's all based on this fundamental principle, it's called Locard's Exchange Principle. It's in forensic science. It's that every contact leaves a trace. And what that means is when you're done in this lab, there will be parts of you left behind in this lab, whether you like it or not, right? 'Cause we're all shedding skin cells and taking things, and taking stuff with us. So if I'm a bomb maker, if I'm involved in manufacturing, you know, illegal fentanyl in my basement, I am ultimately contaminating myself with the bulk material. And this contamination comes in the form of very, very small particles. And the chemical detection systems that we have available now are so sensitive, they can detect a single particle of say, an explosive residue.</p>
</details>

想象一下你有一个包裹里的炸弹，对吗？你正在某个安检设施，对吗？你可能在一个筛选来自海外物品的设施，你可能有一个嗅探器，你有一个市售的蒸汽探测器，你有10秒钟来采样这个包裹。你应该把你的设备指向哪里，对吗？这些实验帮助我们理解你应该把设备指向哪里。我们称之为“打嗝”。我们正在让包裹“打嗝”。所以我们这里有一些丙酮。所以无论你在哪里让它“打嗝”，在哪里挤压它，丙酮蒸汽都会从所有的缝隙中逸出，对吗？所以它们从缝隙中出来，所以那个缝隙给你最大的机会实际检测到里面有什么，对吗？你不想去没有缝隙的地方。你不想去上面没有缝隙的地方。你想去这些角落，那里东西实际上正在渗透出来，渗透到盒子外面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Imagine you have a bomb in a package, right? And you're at some kind of screening facility, right? You're at a facility that maybe is screening things coming in from overseas, maybe you've got a sniffer, you've got a commercially available vapor detector, and you've got 10 seconds to sample this package. Where do you point your device, right? These are the kinds of experiments that help us understand where you should point your device. We call this burping. We're burping the package. So we have some acetone in here. So wherever you burp it, where you squeeze it, you have acetone vapor coming out of all the gaps, right? So they're coming out in the gaps, so that gap gives you the highest chance of actually detecting what's inside, right? You don't want to go over here where there's no gaps. You don't want to go up there where there's no gap. You want to go in these corners here, where stuff is actually kind of permeating through and outside of the box.</p>
</details>

这是我们最近正在做的一些工作。我们基本上是在模拟非法毒品制造。所以这里有一些滑石粉，对吗？没什么大不了的。我把它摇一摇。当我打开并挤压它时，我什么也看不到，但你在相机里看到了什么吗？是的。所以再说一次，肉眼我们永远看不到这个。但因为激光为我们提供了照明，我们能够看到这个。让我们做一个小实验，我将非法物质A倒入物质B中。我首先要做的是，当我取下这个盖子时，请注意看。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This is some recent work we're doing. We are basically simulating illicit drug manufacturing. So here's some talc powder, right? No big deal. I'm gonna shake it up a little bit. When I open this and squeeze, I can't see anything, but are you seeing anything in the camera? Yes. So again, to the naked eye, we'd never be able to see this. But because the laser is doing the illuminating for us, we're able to see this. Let's do a little experiment where I am taking illegal substance A and pouring it into substance B. First thing I'll do, just watch when I take the lid off of this. (tense music)</p>

<p class="english-text">So just imagine, you're in a basement, and you're building stuff like this, and you don't realize that there's all this contamination spreading and landing on other surfaces in your room. And I can't talk about the numbers, but they're pretty startling.</p>

如果你看右上角的图表，那实际上是围绕这个人产生的颗粒的实时计数。所以那个图表基本上代表了他正在处理的材料的吸入暴露量。这太疯狂了，如果你想想看，如果那是芬太尼，而那个人没有戴口罩，他们就完了。我们会在这种东西中添加荧光粉，这样我们就可以实际可视化污染物去了哪里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If you look at the graph and the top right, that is actually real-time counts of the particles that are being generated around this person. So that plot represents basically inhalation exposure of the materials that he's working with. That's crazy, if you think about, 'cause if that's fentanyl, and that person doesn't have a mask on, they're gone. We add fluorescent powder to this kind of stuff, so we can actually visualize where the contamination goes.</p>
</details>

### 公共安全与无人机采样

这另一个很酷的部分是，我们可以使用定量方法来采样房屋表面。我们基本上使用擦拭取样。这和你去机场时的想法是一样的。你有没有去过那里，他们要求检查你的手？是的。对吗？他们会拿一个小棉签擦拭你的手。他们正在寻找这些微量的爆炸物颗粒，如果你参与了爆炸装置的制造，这些颗粒可能在你身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other cool part of this is that we can use a quantitative method of sampling surfaces in the house. We basically use swabbing. And it's the same idea when you go to the airport. Have you ever gone there and they ask for your hands? Yeah. Right? And they take a little swab and they wipe your hands. What they're doing is they're looking for these trace amounts of explosive particles that could be on you if you were involved in the manufacture of an explosive device.</p>

但那是一架无人机。那是在看一架无人机。问题是，你知道，你会得到这种很酷的螺旋桨洗流，这四个螺旋桨都在相互作用。所以问题是，我们能否利用无人机的流体动力学为我们进行采样？我的意思是，如果有可疑的制造设施，比如说制造甲基苯丙胺或芬太尼，你知道，让**危险品处理小组**（Hazmat Crews: 专门处理危险材料的团队）参与进来是非常非常昂贵的。让他们来，他们必须穿上防护服，他们必须进入一个潜在的真正危险的情况。如果我们有一架无人机呢？我们只是把无人机飞进去，对吗？它嗡嗡地飞来飞去，它的腹部有一个特殊的收集器，我们利用无人机的螺旋桨洗流将颗粒从表面搅动起来，然后以某种方式吸入并收集它们。无人机返回基地，你进行化学分析，你说，好的，房子是干净的，或者不，我们发现了东西。好的，现在是时候派出危险品处理小组了。你知道吗？

<p class="english-text">But that's a drone. That's looking at a drone. And the question is, 'cause you know, you get this cool prop wash, and these four propellers that are are all interacting with each other. So the question is, can we use the fluid dynamics of a drone to do the sampling for us? And here's what I mean by that. If there is a suspected, you know, manufacturing facility of something, say it's a methamphetamine or fentanyl, you know, it's very, very expensive to get Hazmat crews involved. Have them come, they have to gown up, they have to go in, to a potential really dangerous situation. What if we had a drone? We just flew the drone in, right? It buzzes around and it's got some special kind of collector on the belly of the drone and we're using the prop wash of the drone to stir up particles off of a surface, and then somehow inhale them, collect them. The drone comes back to base, you run your chemical analysis, you say, okay, the house is clean, or no, we found stuff. Okay, now it's time to pull out the Hazmat crew. You know?</p>

所以我想让你一直牢记在心的大局是公共安全和保障这个理念。所以这才是这个实验室真正发生的事情。但在这个总括性术语之下，想想口罩研究。所以当新冠疫情爆发时，我们在这里改变了研究方向，试图解决一些与口罩相关的问题。这个装置实际上会像人类一样呼吸，那个人恰好是我。所以我测量了我自己的呼吸频率，然后建立了一个系统，设计了一个气动系统来复制它，但它也有一个造雾机，一个雾发生器。所以这个装置基本上看起来就像是吸了一口烟然后呼出。

<p class="english-text">So the big-picture idea that I want you to keep in the back of your head the whole time is this idea of public safety and security. So that's really what happens in this lab. But underneath that kind of umbrella term, think mask research. So when the Covid pandemic hit, we kind of switched gears in here to try to address some of the issues related to masks. This thing will actually breathe as a human does, that human happens to be me. So I measured my own kind of breathing rate, and then built a system, kinda engineered a pneumatic system that replicates that, but it also has a fog machine, a fog generator. So this thing basically just looks like it took a drag off of a cigarette and exhaled.</p>

这很酷的是，它看起来好像什么都没有穿过，对吗？但有数百万计的颗粒试图穿过。有些确实穿过了，因为它不是100%有效的。所以我写了一个图像处理代码。所以你获取这些信息，把它插入代码中，它会根据像素进行分析，并计算白色像素，果然，如果你使用**N95口罩**（N95 Mask: 一种过滤空气中至少95%的非油性颗粒的呼吸防护口罩），你把N95放在这里，通过图像处理代码运行它，你猜有多少百分比的像素会变白？5%？5%。好的。

<p class="english-text">What's kind of cool with this is it looks like there's nothing coming through, right? But there is millions and millions of particles trying to make it through. Some do, 'cause it's not 100%. So I wrote an image-processing code. So you take this information, you plug it into a code, and it analyzes, based on pixels and it's counting white pixels, and sure enough, if you use an N95, you put an N95 on here, you run it through an image processing code, guess what percentage of pixels light up white? 5%? 5%. Okay.</p>

现在我只是想让你自然呼吸。所以当你吸气时，它会变暗。当你呼气时，它会变亮，因为空气被你的肺部加热然后排出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I just want you to breathe naturally. So when you're inhaling, it gets dark. And when you're exhaling, it gets lighter, because the air is being warmed by your lungs and then coming back out.</p>
</details>

就像看到呼吸的效果如此之快，它很快就变暗了，这很有趣。但这向我表明，这个现在根本没有改变颜色。所以这被用来区分密封和过滤。我注意到颜色变化更加剧烈。是的。有了这个，你知道，它进进出出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like it's interesting how fast you can see the effect of the breathing in, like just makes it go dark so quickly. But that shows me that, like this now doesn't change color at all. So this is being used to seal versus filter. I notice the color change is a lot more dramatic. Yeah. With this, you know, it was in and out.</p>

我觉得那是一个更薄的口罩，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel like that's a thinner mask, right?</p>

Matt：是的。所以热量传递会更大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">[Matt] Yeah. So the heat transfer-through, it is gonna be greater.</p>

我觉得有很多东西从上面出来。

<p class="english-text">I feel like there's a lot coming out over the top.</p>

确实有，是的，有很多。如果你只是自然呼吸，你会看到有很多东西从那里出来。

<p class="english-text">There is, yeah, there's a lot. If you just breathe naturally, you'll see a lot coming out there.</p>

关于口罩的事情，对吧，就像，最初他们说，口罩没用，不要戴口罩。然后他们说，口罩有用，比如，戴布口罩，然后他们说，不，布口罩没用，就像，我不知道，关于口罩有很多困惑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The thing with masks, right, is like, initially they were like, masks don't work, don't wear a mask. And then they were like, masks do work, like, and wear a cloth mask, and then they were like, no, no cloth masks don't work, like, I don't know, there was a lot of confusion around masks.</p>
</details>

我们很早就了解到，关于口罩有效性的沟通本可以改进，对吗？所以这就是我们用纹影成像做我们所做的事情的原因。事实是，普通美国人不会坐下来阅读科学期刊文章。但他们会坐下来观看一个90秒的视频，看我戴着或不戴口罩咳嗽。这就是我们所做的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What we learned early on was that the communication of, you know, mask effectiveness could have been improved, right? And so that's kind of why I did what we did with the Schlieren. The truth is, the average American is not gonna sit down and read a scientific journal article. But they will sit down and watch a 90-second video of me coughing with a mask on and off. And that's what we did.</p>

### NIST在公共安全研究中的作用与未来展望

我们与其他联邦机构在这里有一种独特的关系。所以你有一个三字母机构，它对某件事有特定的需求，对吗？在安全领域。他们通常会来到NIST，他们会说，嘿，我们真的对采样人们鞋子上的爆炸物很感兴趣，无论出于什么原因，对吗？所以我们在这里，特别是在这个实验室里，我们找出一些好的方法来采样鞋子上的爆炸物？哪些方法不太好？为了评估一个甚至还不存在的鞋子采样系统，测量需要是什么样子？然后支持这些测量的标准需要是什么样子？对吗？所以我们在实验室里找出所有这些东西，整齐地打包好，交还给赞助机构，然后他们将其带给工业界。工业界在开发这类系统方面已经领先一步，因为我们在这里的实验室里做了大量的繁重工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of a unique relationship we have with other federal agencies here. So you have a three-letter agency that has a specific need for something, right? In the security arena. What they'll often do is they'll come here to NIST, and they'll say, hey, we're really interested in sampling people's shoes for explosives for whatever reason, right? So what we do here, and in this lab in particular, is we figure out what are some good ways to sample shoes for explosives? What are some not so good ways, right? What do the measurements need to look like to evaluate a shoe-sampling system that doesn't even exist yet? And then what do the standards need to look like that support those measurements, right? And so we figure all this stuff out in the lab, package it up nice and neat, give it back to the sponsoring agency, and then they take it to industry. And industry already has a leg up on the development of these kinds of systems, because we did a lot of the heavy lifting here in the lab.</p>

因为随着与新冠相关的可视化项目的成功，我们现在意识到这种技术的应用空间是巨大的。室内空气质量。你可以想象一个更大的镜子，我们可以观察两个人之间的互动，以及这种从一个人到另一个人的转移是怎样的。核心信息是，气流可视化是我们在NIST使用的一个关键工具，它真正帮助我们理解正在发生的事情，对吗？对各种表面进行定量分析是一回事，但现在我们可以看到，我们实际上可以看到正在发生的事情，以及这些颗粒是在哪里产生的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Because with the success of, you know, doing the Covid-related visualization, we're realizing now that the application space for this kind of technology is huge. Indoor air quality. You can imagine a bigger mirror where we could look at two people interacting with each other, and what that transfer looks like from one person to the other. The take-home message is flow visualization is a critical tool that we use here at NIST to really help understand what's happening, right? It's one thing to do quantitative analysis on various surfaces, but now we can see, we can actually see what's happening, and where these particles are generated.</p>

<p class="english-text">Thanks to Lutron for sponsoring this portion of this video. Perfect lighting isn't just important for visualizing air flow, it's also essential for making your house feel welcoming, cozy and safe. And with the sponsor of this video, Caseta by Lutron, you can easily set up your own perfect lighting. You know, Caseta provides premium smart lighting control, including switches, remotes and plug-in smart dimmers, which allow you to customize your home lighting from anywhere in the house. What I love about smart switches is that one switch can control many regular bulbs. So you can effectively make all your bulbs smart just by replacing the switch. And installation is easy.</p>
</details>

首先，确保你关闭了开关的电源，然后断开现有电线，并将它们连接到Caseta的智能开关。如果你需要任何帮助，他们只需点击或致电即可。然后通过智能集线器，你只需使用手机就可以打开和关闭灯光。或者你可以使用其他设备，比如Alexa或Google Assistant。Caseta与比任何其他智能照明控制系统更多的智能家居品牌兼容。此外，他们的开关不依赖Wi-Fi，所以它们始终保持连接，你始终可以控制你的灯光。我个人喜欢在家里设置定时器，例如我办公室的灯会在晚上自动打开。这让我安心，我的家人总会回到一个光线充足的家。最棒的是，如果我已经上床睡觉了，我可以检查哪些灯还亮着，然后关掉它们，而无需跑遍整个房子。在casetawireless.com/veritasium了解更多关于Caseta的信息。感谢Lutron赞助我视频的这一部分。

<p class="english-text">First, make sure you turn off power to the switch, and then disconnect the existing wires, and connect them to Caseta's Smart Switch. If you need any help, they're just a click or a call away. And then with the Smart Hub, you can turn your lights on and off just using your phone. Or you can use another device, like Alexa or Google Assistant. Caseta works with more smart home brands than any other smart lighting control system. Plus their switches don't rely on Wi-Fi, so they always stay connected, and you always have control over your lights. I personally like setting timers in my house, for example the lights in my office turn on by themselves in the evening. And this gives me peace of mind that my family will always come home to a well-lit house. And the best part of it all is if I'm already in bed, I can just check which lights are still on, and turn them off without having to run around the house.
