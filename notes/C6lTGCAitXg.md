### 细菌：地球上最特别的生物

我从小就经常生病，肺炎总是缠着我，这都源于细菌。高中时，我参加了一个自然科学展览会，遇到了两位学长，他们告诉我他们正在改造细菌，用于生产蛋白质，从而解决世界饥饿问题。这个场景彻底改变了我的人生，因为我之前并不知道细菌的潜力。它们是地球上最特别的生物，因为它们拥有超强的力量，可以在一瞬间杀死你，也可以拯救你。我叫 Patricia Ayma Maldonado，是一名细菌训练师。2018年，我创立了这家公司，我们正在利用能吃有机废物的细菌生产可生物降解的生物塑料。

I remember all my childhood
being at the doctor,
and my frequent pneumonia
were due to bacteria.
At high school, I went
to a natural science fair,
and I met two older students
[who] told me that they were
like modifying bacteria
for producing proteins
and solv[ing] hunger in the world.
And that scenario just changed my life
because I didn't know
the potential of bacteria.
They are the most special
creature on Earth
because they are super powerful.
They just can kill you
or save you in a second.
I am Patricia Ayma Maldonado,
and I am a bacteria trainer.
In 2018, I founded the company.
We are producing
a biodegradable bioplastic
with bacteria that eat organic waste.

### 塑料问题的本质：生产、使用与处置

我认为塑料本身并不是问题，问题在于我们如何生产它、如何使用它以及如何处理它。塑料对于不同的社会、技术和医疗进步至关重要，它被广泛应用于我们能想到的任何领域。塑料轻便、柔软、灵活，并且具有其他产品无法比拟的优异性能。我们需要塑料。传统上，塑料是从石油中提取的。石油基塑料在环境中停留时间很长，而且全球只有9%的塑料被回收利用。90%的塑料被焚烧，50%被填埋。即使被回收，塑料也会降低质量，因此通常需要将其与原生塑料混合，才能达到最佳的应用效果。所谓原生塑料，是指从石油中首次提取的塑料。2023年的数据显示，原生塑料的提取量有所增加，这意味着我们既在推广回收利用，又在增加原生塑料的生产，这是一种虚假的**可持续性**（Sustainability: 满足当前需求而不损害后代满足其需求的能力）幻觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
I think that plastic
isn't a problem itself.
It's how we produce it,
how we use it
and how we dispose of it.
Plastic is crucial for different social,
technological and medical advancements.
We use it in wherever you can think.
Plastic is light,
plastic is soft, plastic is flexible,
and it has a very good performance
that [no] other products can give.
We need plastic.
Traditionally, plastic is extracted
from petrol sources.
Petrol-based plastic
sticks around for a long time,
and only nine percent of the plastic
in the world is recycled.
Ninety percent of plastic is incinerated,
and 50 percent goes to landfills.
When it gets recycled, it loses quality.
So it is quite important
to mix it again with virgin plastic
in order to have the best
application of the product.
When I mean virgin plastic,
I mean the plastic that is extracted,
for the first time,
from this fraction of the petroleum.
Data from 2023 shows that extraction
of virgin plastic has increased.
So that means that we
are promoting recycling
and also virgin production
[of] plastic is increasing.
So it is the perfect illusion
of sustainability.

### 系统性责任：从个人到企业

如果我们什么都不做，到2050年，海洋中的塑料将超过鱼的数量。塑料污染仍在增长，并将持续增长，除非我们改变系统问责的方式。因为往往看起来，所有的责任都落在个人身上。无论你如何努力避免使用一次性塑料，无论你如何在家中正确地进行分类，这永远都不够。一家公司生产塑料产品，而消费者却要负责保护地球。我需要这种塑料，但你们没有给我提供另一种解决方案。他们必须开始思考未来，是时候承担责任，用能够保护地球的材料来替代这种材料了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
If we do nothing,
in 2050, there will be more plastic
than fish in the sea.
It is still growing
and will continue growing
if we do not change how the system
is accountable on that.
Because it often seems
that the full responsibility
falls onto individuals.
No matter how you try
to avoid single-use plastics,
no matter how you separate
properly at your home,
it will never be enough.
A company puts a plastic product,
and the customer
has to take care of the planet.
I need that plastic,
you are not giving me another solution.
They have to start
thinking about the future.
It's time to be accountable
and to substitute this type of material
for the ones that can
take care of the planet.

### 生物塑料：双重生物基的解决方案

**生物塑料**（Bioplastic: 由可再生生物质来源制成的塑料）是指满足以下两个条件之一的塑料。它要么是生物基的，这意味着它不含石油基塑料；要么是生物降解或可堆肥的，即其生命周期结束时可以自然分解。我们的生物塑料是双重生物基的，从其来源到其生命周期结束，都是生物基的。我们与农产品公司合作，例如啤酒生产公司，他们将啤酒生产后的剩余酵母提供给我们。第一阶段，我们有一群细菌“烹饪”废料，它们就像厨师一样，将废料烹饪得非常美味。第二阶段，另一群细菌将美味的废料转化为生物塑料。最终，我们获得生物塑料。这是某些细菌可以做到的事情，并非所有细菌都可以做到，这是一种适应性生存技能。你需要“请求”细菌做某事，它们就会去做。对我来说，细菌是女孩，好吧？（笑声）所以它是一个超级女孩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So a bioplastic is a plastic
that meets one of these two conditions.
It is bioplastic from its origin.
That means there is no
petrol-based plastic.
Or it is bioplastic for its end of life.
That means that it's
biodegradable or compostable.
Our bioplastic is double bioplastic,
from its origin to its end of life.
We work with agri-food companies,
for example, a beer production company,
and they give to us
the leftover, or the spent yeast
from the beer production.
At first stage,
we have a group of bacterias
that cook the waste, OK?
They are like the chef,
and they cook the waste
so that is like, really tasty.
For a second stage,
another one group of bacteria
take that tasty waste
and produce the bioplastic.
And at the end, we obtain the bioplastic.

### 细菌工厂：从废弃物到价值的转变

我们采用一种安装在废物产生地（客户设施）的系统，直接将废物导入我们的模型，我们的“盒子”，并且该系统每天24小时运转。这对于与我们合作的公司来说，是一个全新的场景。他们从管理废物转变为获得真正的利益和价值，因为他们无需更换机器，只需要改变思维方式。目前，我们每天已经处理三吨的废弃酵母。我们用300克酵母生产1公斤生物塑料。顺便说一下，这种生物塑料是由细菌和有机废物生产的，它具有与石油基塑料相同的外观和相似的行为。这意味着它可以熔化、流动、进入机器，并提供强度。你可以用它来制造与石油基塑料相同的产品。目前，这种生物塑料已经在奢侈品领域得到应用，例如香水、化妆品、医疗保健等，任何你能想到的需要塑料的产品都可以使用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
This is a thing that some kind
of bacteria can do,
not all the bacteria can do,
and it's an adaptive survival skill.
You have to ask bacteria
[to do] something, and she will do it.
For me, bacteria is a girl, OK?
(Laughs)
So it’s a super-girl.
We work with a system that is installed
there where the waste is generated,
in the customer facilities,
and we start taking the waste
directly into our model, our box,
and that is working 24 hours a day.
It is a new scenario
for companies working with us.
They go from managing a waste
into having a real benefit, a real value,
because they do not
have to change machines,
they have to change the mentality.
Right now, we are already treating
three tons of spent yeast in a day.
We take 300 grams of yeast
to produce one kilo of bioplastic.
And this is bioplastic, by the way,
produced with bacteria and organic waste.
So it has the same appearance
and it behaves really similar.
It means that it can melt,
it can flow, it can enter in the machines,
it can give you like a strength, you know.
And you just can make the same products
as petrol-based plastics.

### 生物降解与未来展望

如果你把塑料扔掉——顺便说一下，我不想让你这样做，我希望你正确地分类。但如果你这样做，我们可以预期生物塑料进入海洋环境后，在四个月内可以降解90%，具体取决于生物塑料的寿命。生物塑料不会产生微塑料。它是天然的，自然分解成小化合物，成为其他细菌和微生物的食物。现在我们拥有这些细菌，并且我们的计划已经运行，每天处理三吨有机废物，将其转化为生物塑料，这使我们走在了这场全球马拉松的最前沿。这是一种新的方式，一种新的替代方案，可以保护地球。这就是我所努力的方向，它确实值得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Right now, this bioplastic is already
working in luxury, like perfume,
cosmetics, healthcare,
whatever you can imagine with a plastic
that behaves as a petrol-based
plastic, you know?
If you throw the plastic away --
I don't want you to do that, by the way.
I want you to separate properly.
But if you do it, then we can expect
that bioplastic gets
to the marine environment.
And maybe in four months
it can biodegrade in 90 percent,
depending on the life
that the bioplastic has.
You cannot make microplastics
with bioplastics.
It is organic, it breaks naturally,
like in small compounds,
and is food for other bacteria,
for other microorganisms.
Having this bacteria right now
and having our plan already functioning,
working with three tons
of organic waste a day,
transforming this into bioplastic,
it puts us on the first line
of this marathon,
this global marathon.
This is a new way, a new alternative
to take care of the planet.
This is what I work for,
and it is really worthy.
