### 全球经济现状：特朗普时代的回归与不确定性
当前全球经济的形态本还算不错，但显然，随着唐纳德·特朗普带来的全球化重组以及欧洲正在发生的变化，经济正被卷入混乱之中。现在是一个相当疯狂的时期。说这是我们前所未见的局面可能有点夸张，我觉得这感觉有点像70年代。特朗普本人也让我想起了尼克松，但显然，我们正面临一段颠簸的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you assess the current state of the global economy just now? Well, it was in modestly good shape, but obviously it's being thrown into chaos with the restructuring of globalization that Donald Trump comes with what's happening in Europe. You know, it it's a pretty wild time. I don't think it's it'd be a little bit much say it's unlike anything we've seen before. I think it feels a little like the 70s to me. Trump actually feels a little like Nixon to me, but obviously we're in for a wild ride.</p>
</details>

所谓的美国例外论现在也受到了冲击。我们有时称美国为**霸权**（Hegemon: 指在国际体系中拥有主导地位的国家），即主宰一切的国家。而现在，这个霸权似乎正在自我攻击。特朗普声称，度过这一切之后情况会变得更好，我希望他真有一个计划。但显然，股市和所有人都在变得紧张，担心可能根本没有计划。我不知道，作为美国总统，我希望他的政策能成功，但很难确切理解他的走向和做法。这在很多方面都感觉像是回到了70年代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where are we in terms of American exceptionalism now? Well, it's been dented. I mean, I'd almost we sometimes call the US the hegemon, the one that dominates everything. And it's almost like the hegeimon is turning on itself. And Trump says, and I hope he has a plan, that it's all going to be better on the other side of this, but uh obviously the stock markets are getting nervous. Uh everybody's getting nervous that there might not be a plan. I don't know. I mean, I say I he's the president of the United States. I wish his policies well, but uh it's it's hard to understand exactly where he's going and what he's doing. Again, it feels like a throwback to the 70s in a lot of ways.</p>
</details>

### 关税政策的深远影响
我最大的担忧是，我们正在侵蚀构成美国例外论基石的制度，比如对法治的信任，以及美国言出必行的信誉。我不是说我们过去总是如此，但在偿还债务方面确实是这样。我当然也担心那种认为信奉全球贸易和全球一体化的人就是“**全球主义者**”（Globalists: 相信全球贸易和一体化对世界有利的人）的观点。我自己就是一个毫无歉意的全球主义者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are your biggest concern when it comes to the current economic policy? Well, I mean, the the the biggest concern is that uh we undermine the institutions that are the bedrock of US exceptionalism. You trust the rule of law. Uh when the United States gives its word, it keeps its word. I'm not saying we always did that, but you know, uh certainly with respect to paying our debts, uh I'm concerned uh certainly about this view that people uh who believe in global trade and global integration are globalists. I'm an unapologetic globalist myself.</p>
</details>

全球经济的这种分裂令人担忧。特朗普和他的人有时会说，“让我们回到50年代吧。”但50年代我们的收入水平要低得多。好吧，也许我们会有更多的制造业岗位，也许吧，但物品的价格会高出很多。很难判断这其中有多少是虚张声势的表演，以及他是否会退让。显然，早期大家都是这么认为的，觉得他只是为了迎合他的基本盘，之后会收敛。但目前看来，情况并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh this fracturing of the global economy. I mean, Trump sometimes and his people sometimes say, "Let's go back to the 50s." Well, we had a lot lower income back in the 50s. Like, okay, maybe we'll have more manufacturing jobs, maybe, but things will cost a lot more. I mean, it's it's just a little hard to know how much of its bluster theater. He'll retreat. Obviously, early on that's what everyone thought that he was just saying this for his base and he would pull back, but uh you know that's uh um certainly not how it's been going.</p>
</details>

预测一年后的关税情况非常困难，感觉他每天早上醒来都在转轮盘。他先转轮盘决定指向哪个国家，然后再转一次决定要征收多少关税，第二天又改变主意。这真的很难预测，但我认为他对此非常执着。所以我猜，美国会对欧洲征收至少10%、15%甚至20%的关税，而欧洲也会进行报复，期间会有很多来回的噪音。他似乎是关税的信徒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where do you see tariffs a year from now? Whoa. You threw in the year from now. I mean, it seems like he's spinning a wheel when he when he wakes up every morning. And first he spins the wheel to see what country it points at, and then he spins the wheel to see what tariff he wants to put on, and then he changes his mind the next day. I mean, that's that's a really hard thing to forecast, but I I I think he's very intent on it. So I'm guessing the US will have tariffs for example on Europe uh on on the uh on the order of uh uh I don't know at least 10 you know 15% 20%. And Europe will have retaliated and there'll have been a lot of noise back and forth. He he he seems to be a believer.</p>
</details>

早在2016年他第一次竞选时，一个与他关系密切的人打电话给我，问我有没有什么总体看法。我说，首先，这次谈话从未发生过，我不能被看作是和你交谈。但既然你问了，我讨论了一些事情，并指出关税是个糟糕的主意。那人回答说，候选人特朗普比我更懂政治，他认为80%的美国人都喜欢关税。可悲的是，我发现这一点很难反驳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I even back in 2016 when he was first running someone who was uh close to him called me and just for did I have any general thoughts and I said okay first of all this conversation never happened I'm I I can't be seen as talking to you but if you ask me I discussed some things but the tariffs are a terrible idea why are you doing the tariffs this is this is and uh you know the person said Well, you know, the candidate, uh, Trump, uh, he knows politics better than I do, and he thinks 80% of Americans love tariffs. And actually, you know, I, sadly, I find that hard to argue with.</p>
</details>

我的母亲是一位图书管理员，一个非常聪明的女性。她也喜欢关税。我作为一名经济学家，拥有国际经济学博士学位，我会跟她解释关税会让所有东西都变贵，我们是否真的想这么做，并详细说明我们买他们的东西、他们买我们的东西的整个复杂过程。但她就是不让步，不同意我的观点。这是一个受过良好教育的女性，所以关税确实很受欢迎。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, my mother was a librarian, a brilliant woman. Uh, uh, she sadly passed away a few years ago, but she liked tariffs. And I would I'm an economist and she kind of knew I had a PhD in economist and I worked on international economics and I would say yeah but you know it would make everything more expensive and do we really want to do this and I went into the whole rigmarole about how we buy stuff from them and they'd buy stuff from us us and she just wouldn't give in you know she did not agree and I mean that's a you know very educated woman and so it's very popular.</p>
</details>

历史上，这正是总统需要站出来扮演的角色之一：即使人们喜欢关税，也要告诉他们“这就像吃蔬菜，你可能不喜欢，但对你有好处，吃了才能成长”。顺便说一句，特朗普并非首创此举。在2016年差点成为候选人、在民主党内非常有影响力的伯尼·桑德斯，他的主张也大同小异。虽然他现在不会承认，但当时美国左翼的立场和特朗普之间并没有太大差别。全球化对美国来说显然是极好的，我们何必自欺欺人呢？美国一直处于顶端，从中受益。是的，全球化存在问题，但他似乎就认为关税对他非常有利。我们将拭目以待结果如何。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And historically This has been one of the issues where the president who knows that people don't like tariffs, people like tariffs, stands and says, "Well, you know, this you you don't like you don't want to have to eat your your vegetables, but eat them and you'll grow and it'll be better." And uh Trump didn't invent this, by the way. Bernie Sanders, who was came very close to being the candidate in 2016, is very influential in the Democratic party. He had pretty much the same stuff. he wouldn't agree now, but there's not a lot of open water between really the left where the left was in the US and Trump. I mean, it's it's been one of those things which, you know, uh it's it's been obviously very good. Globalization's been great for the United States. Who are we kidding? I mean, the United States has been at the top. has benefited and yes, there are problems with globalization, but uh he he seems to just think it's really good for him. We'll we'll see how it plays out.</p>
</details>

说实话，如果我们只是全面征收20%的关税，情况会很糟糕，就像一次大规模的增税。它会减少贸易，干扰全球供应链等等。但这并非世界末日，前提是特朗普同时采取一系列明智的措施，比如放松管制、寻找提高创新的方法等。如果他能做到，总体上可能还行。关税确实能增加财政收入。但这件事最奇怪的地方在于其随机性，你根本不知道接下来会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How bad are Tariffs for globalization? So, truth be told, if we just slapped on 20% tariffs, it would be very bad, like a big tax hike. It would reduce trade. it would interfere with the global supply chains and such. It would not be the end of the world if together with that Trump did a bunch of sensible things deregulation uh you know finding uh ways to uh improve innovation. I don't know. But if he did on balance it could be okay. They do raise revenue. What what's just been so weird about it is the randomness of it. Just you don't know what's coming.</p>
</details>

这就像他想让所有人都躲着他。我看着各个国家，就像企鹅被北极熊捕食一样。它们对此感到悲伤，但不想上前与北极熊搏斗，只是向后退缩。现在每个国家都是这样，都希望北极熊去关注别的国家。我认为真正的问题在于这种随机性，以及它预示着未来可能出现的其他事情，比如中央银行的独立性。

<p class="english-text">It's like he wants everyone to hide from him. I I I sort of look at country I I don't know if you ever visited the North Pole, but the the uh uh penguins are sort of getting eaten by the polar bear and they're very sad about that, but they don't want to go in and fight the polar bear. They sort of hold back and that's how everyone is. they want. Oh, go look at the other country. And anyway, I I I think the real problem is the randomness and what it signals about other things to come such as central bank independence.</p>
</details>

关税对通胀的影响其实不是大问题。它会推高物价，但美国是一个相当封闭的经济体，所以物价上涨会有一个短期效应。这虽然不愉快，一部分会体现为通货膨胀，一部分是质量下降，但真正的问题在于创新放缓、长期增长受损，以及对美国消费者的影响。每一项研究都表明，关税最终由我们消费者承担。这在他2018年实施关税时就已得到验证。所以，这套说辞有点像“墨西哥会为边境墙买单”一样，最终是美国消费者通过更高的价格和更低的商品质量来支付关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What will be the impact on inflation from the tariffs? So that is not a big deal. I mean uh it raises prices. is the United States is pretty closed and it raises prices there'll be a short-term effect that's I mean it won't be pleasant and I think some of it will be inflation some of it lower quality but the the problem is more uh innovation slowing growth over the longer run and uh the effect on American consumers well you know of course we pay the tariffs dollar for dollar. Every study shows that. It shows it on other examples. It shows it when he put in tariffs in 2018. And uh so you know this whole story, it's a little bit obviously like Mexico will pay for the wall. The American consumers will pay the tariffs both in terms of higher prices and I think lower quality. their goods that if they revert to the United States will will be lower quality than we get at the moment at least for a long time to come.</p>

### 欧洲的应对之道：地缘政治的再平衡
从棋手的角度看，欧洲需要将长期战略与短期战术结合起来。特朗普正在迫使欧洲做一些它可能早就该做的事情。多年来我一直在欧洲的演讲中提到，我们需要欧洲成为美国的地缘政治制衡力量。你不能每次美国总统大选时都重新思考一切。你需要一个制衡，而欧洲，尽管有其内部摩擦和分歧，但可能更稳定。法国或德国的一次选举不会突然改变一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you navigate the trade negotiations in the US from like a chess player point of view? I think you have to combine, you know, long-term strategy. What is it we want to do? Some of the things Trump is forcing Europe to do, it probably should have done a long time ago. I think I've I've said whenever I've given talks in Europe uh over the years or at least often we need Europe to be a geopolitical counterweight to the United States. You can't every time there's a presidential election and you know you think people think you know this is the worst thing that'll ever happen. I don't know what's to come. Every time there's a presidential election you can't suddenly rethink everything. you need a counterbalance and Europe uh for whatever its frictions and divisions probably is more more stable. You don't have one election in France or Germany suddenly changing everything. Change a lot but not everything. So that's good.</p>
</details>

欧洲需要考虑在科技上更加独立。前欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉 (Mario Draghi) 在一份报告中指出了欧洲在这方面的落后。军事和科技是相连的，因为军事项目常常为科技初创企业和投资提供早期资金。至于短期战术，确实很难抉择。是向特朗普屈服、亲吻他的戒指，以避免200%的关税，还是忍气吞声，希望事态平息？这都不是好的选择。但从另一方面看，这迫使欧洲变得更果断、更独立，我认为这是早就该发生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh on the other and you you uh you need to think about um being more independent in tech. that Mario Draghi, the former head of the ECB, wrote a report where he made that point where Europe's lagged. And those two things are connected because military often provides the funding early on for uh tech uh tech startups, tech investment and uh I mean then there's short-term tactics which obviously really hard to know. I mean, do you supplicate to Trump and kiss the ring or which your public hates, but then he's not throwing a 200% tariff on you, or do you just sort of turn the other cheek and hope that it calms down? I mean, it's it's it it's not it's not good in a way, but on the other hand, it kind of forces Europe to g be more assertive, to be more independent in a way that I think has been a long time coming.</p>
</details>

### 美国经济衰退风险与政治分歧
美国出现经济衰退的几率已急剧上升。有趣的是，我们可能面临的衰退性质是信心丧失，而非石油危机、大流行病或全球金融危机。在消费者中，尤其是那些没有投票给特朗普的人（约占一半），他们认为世界末日即将来临。民主党选民的各项指标都糟糕得离谱。奇怪的是，他们也认为通胀将飙升。而你和共和党人交谈，他们则觉得一切都好，经济运行良好，总统工作出色，通胀会很低。他们看着同样的数据，却得出完全不同的结论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Will we have a recession in the US? I mean, I think the odds have gone up sharply. And it's sort of funny, but the nature of the recession we might get is a loss of confidence, not an oil shock, not a pandemic, not a global financial crisis. But among consumers, particularly consumers who didn't vote for Trump, which is about half of people, they think it's the end of the world. They think it's 2008-9, the global financial crisis, the pandemic. The indicators for the Democratic voters are just off the charts terrible. Oddly enough, they also think inflation's going to go through the roof. You talk to the Republicans, everything's ducky. They economy is doing fine. There's nothing to worry about. President's doing a great job. Inflation's going to be low. I mean, they're looking at the same data and just drawing completely different conclusions.</p>
</details>

我从未见过政治倾向如此严重地影响人们对数据的看法。当然，这种情况一直存在，比如在拜登执政期间，共和党人认为通胀远高于实际水平，而民主党人则认为远低于实际水平。但现在这种情况更为显著，并且可能引发衰退，因为共和党人的消费增加不足以弥补民主党人的消费减少。我收到很多亲戚、朋友甚至专业同事的信件和邮件，问我是否应该卖掉所有资产，世界是否即将终结。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you seen this before that um political uh inclination uh impacts the way you look at data this way? I've never seen it, of course we see it but uh we saw it under Biden where the Republicans thought inflation was way higher than it was and the Democrats thought inflation was way lower than it was. I mean just ask what's inflation and the Republicans just give a different answer. But it is much more pronounced and it can cause a recession because yeah you the the Republicans are not going to spend enough to make up for what the Democrats aren't spending. I get so many letters and emails from relatives, friends, even professional colleagues. Should I sell everything? You know, is the world ending?</p>
</details>

我不相信存在所谓的“**特朗普看跌期权**”（Trump Put: 指市场相信如果股市下跌，特朗普会采取措施进行干预以支撑市场的信念）。他显然会关注市场，但他是一个非常决心要在历史上留下自己印记的人。他内心深处相信关税是美好的。他在第一个任期内言出必行。因此，市场认为他会退让的想法是过去的思维。真正令人担忧的是政策的随机性。如果他只是征收10%或20%的关税，那并非世界末日。但这种不可预测性才是问题所在。所以我认为他有坚定的信念，不会轻易退缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you believe there is such a thing as a Trump put? He clearly looks at the market, but this is someone who's very determined to put his place in history. He I don't know if it came from his childhood or something, but he has this deep belief that tariffs are beautiful. He says it again and again. It seemed to have worked very well for him politically. He in his first term when he said something, he delivered it. And so I I don't you know that that was certainly the the thinking that the markets had was that he would pull back. Now I want to emphasize the real concerns the randomness of it if if he just put in tariffs which we did think he was going to do and you know 10% 20% it it would not have been the end of the world. Bad idea but not crippling you it would hurt growth in the long run. it would hurt US welfare, but you know, nothing to uh nothing compared to some of the bigger things that go on. So, I don't I don't believe in a Trump put. Uh I think he has conviction.</p>

### 美元霸权的黄昏：一个时代的转折点
我认为，美元在全球经济中的足迹和主导地位在十年前就已达到顶峰。从储备持有量、交易数量、以美元计价的商品等多种衡量标准来看，都呈现出相同的故事。美元体系一直很幸运，美国的制度也很好，但随着美国面临挑战者，它们的表现比我预想的要差。这并不意味着欧元会取代美元，但令人惊讶的是，欧元目前仍是一种区域性货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's your view now on on the US dollar's global role? So I think uh and my book argues that we sort of reached the peak 10 years ago in terms of the dollar's footprint and dominance in the global economy and lots of different measures uh you know how many reserves people hold uh number of transactions in dollars what's priced in dollars and we won't need to go into detail. they all kind of tell the same story and I think there's this what I sort of portray there is there's this sense in which the dollar has been lucky at different stages the US has been good the US system's good but as the US has faced challenggers I think they've fallen short more than I would have guessed and it it doesn't mean we'd have the euro instead of the dollar but it is a surprise that the euro right now is a regional currency It's just basically not a central currency outside of Europe.</p>
</details>

我引用丹麦国际象棋特级大师本特·拉尔森 (Bent Larsen) 的话说，当被问及愿意选择幸运还是优秀时，他回答说：“我宁愿既幸运又优秀。”我认为美国人忘记了幸运的部分，只是拍着胸脯说我们是世界上最伟大的国家。因此，我认为有很多趋势正推动美元仍然处于顶端，但已不像过去那样是绝对的王者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually towards the end of the book quote the Danish Grandmaster Ben Larson uh and he was asked would you rather be lucky or good and he said I'd rather be lucky and good and I think Americans forget the lucky part we just beat ourselves on the chest we're the greatest country in the world everybody loves us so I think there are a lot of trends pushing towards the dollar still being at the top but not quite as much king of the world as we were.</p>
</details>

全球储备货币的更替通常是缓慢的，需要上百年时间。我将美元描述为处于“中晚期”。目前没有谁能立即取而代之。要让美元戏剧性地消失，除非发生像去年一部名为《内战》(Civil War) 的电影中所描绘的反乌托邦未来，美元变得一文不值，人人都用加元。但我不认为这种情况会戏剧性地发生。

<p class="english-text">Is there a scenario where the dollar uh loses its status as the world reserve currency in a bit more dramatic fashion? What what could what could cause that?

I don't know you know but no I don't see it happen dramatic happening dramatically.</p>

### 中国经济放缓及其全球影响
中国正认真考虑扩大**人民币**（Renminbi: 中国的官方货币）的国际足迹，让更多商品和贷款以人民币计价。他们这么做有几个原因。首先，这事他们20年前就该做了。其次，美国对俄罗斯的制裁让他们惊出一身冷汗。中国肯定在考虑某天可能因台湾问题而触怒美国，因此正审视这些制裁措施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there's the uh polemic stuff like when Lula says he doesn't want to use the dollar in Brazil and he he has no power. I mean, he's not able to do anything. But I think the Chinese take it very seriously of wanting it's it's not that they want to get everyone for everything to use the renminbi their Chinese currency instead. It's that they want to expand its footprint. more things priced in Chinese currency, more loans priced in Chinese currency. And they've got a couple reasons for this. First of all, they should have done that 20 years ago. Over time, it has become a little looser. But I think what's really scared the daylights out of them is watching what the US has tried to do to Russia with the sanctions. And you know, we don't know, but China is certainly thinking about uh, you know, provoking the ire of the United States at some point by trying to take over Taiwan and looking at the sanctions.</p>
</details>

问题不仅在于制裁本身，还在于美国能够洞察一切的能力。美国有能力制定游戏规则。在银行家们就交易机制进行谈判时，美国拥有巨大的影响力。许多交易都通过美国进行清算，只要触及美元，大部分都会经过美国。通过将更多交易转为人民币并发展自己的清算机制，中国可以规避这一点。这与他们寻求多元化的其他所有考量同样重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it it isn't just, you know, it isn't just the sanctions, it's the ability of the United States to see everything. And I a thing many people don't understand about the military and power and dominance of the United States is the US gets to make the rules of the game when bankers are negotiating over you know what kind of uh transactions mechanism should we have how swift is something people may have heard of the uh international uh messaging system that's used by banks all of these negotiations the US, you know, it's not like they say it's our bomb and we're going to go home if you don't do what we want, but they can. And it gives them this tremendous power and so many things go through the United States. We Donald Trump can possibly see some things you bought uh because the clearing goes through the United States. If it touches the dollar, most of it goes to the United States. So by getting more things into rembi getting more things into the Chinese currency and developing their own the word is rails but their own clearing mechanisms they can get around this that's as big as all the other things that the Chinese are looking at when they're trying to diversify.</p>

我对中国官方公布的5%左右的GDP增长数据持怀疑态度。他们甚至因质疑数据而将学者投入监狱。中国经济放缓对能源和商品出口国影响巨大。如果中国未来两三年的增长率是2-3%而不是8%，这对挪威、美国、巴西和阿根廷等能源生产国来说都不是好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh official Chinese GDP growth is around 5%. Some people think it's it's lower and you are quite skeptical when it comes to the official figure as well, right? Yeah, absolutely. They're throwing people in in jail for questioning the figure. They're academics who said in uh too publicly that they thought the growth was overstated and they got in trouble. What are the global implications of a Chinese economic slowdown? Well, um it's very big on uh energy exporters and commodity exporters. I mean, if you if we were to turn around and tell you that China's growth's going to be 8% the next 2 or 3 years instead of I think it's going to be 2 or 3%. Uh probably that would be very good for inflows into the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. I mean and for Norway in general uh and for the United States as a big uh energy producer and good for Brazil and good for Argentina.</p>

中国正在出现某种程度的“**日本化**”（Japanification: 指一个经济体陷入类似日本长期的低增长、低通胀甚至通缩的停滞状态）。问题只是程度深浅。在金融危机后的复苏速度上，瑞典是最快的，而日本则花了二十年。中国的“瑞典时间”已经结束了。在我看来，这场危机还会持续好几年。通货紧缩、增长缓慢、房地产问题、基础设施和住房过度建设，这些相似之处确实非常惊人。

<p class="english-text">So, do we have a some kind of japanification in China now then? Yes, we do. The question is a matter of degree. So we those of us who work on financial crisis look at Sweden on the one end is like the fastest recovery ever and the other end is Japan which by some measures took two decades. China's Sweden time is over. That's gone. They're having a longer crisis than that. Uh it looks to me like it'll be a few more years uh to I don't I don't I think that China has a lot of things going for it but they have this over centralization of power which you know may undermine their longer term growth but it's uh you know certainly the the the deflation the slow growth the housing problem the ahe overbuilding in infrastructure and housing the similarities are are really quite remarkable.</p>

中国真正做得好的地方是其私营部门，它们在某些科技领域极具创新性。但政府打压了它们，比如阿里巴巴创始人马云的遭遇。他们需要回归到由私营部门引领增长的模式，但习主席一直不愿放权。

<p class="english-text">Well, the thing is where China was doing really well was their private sector. They're they were very innovative. There are areas of tech where they're just fantastic and uh they're great investments in China if you could make them now. But they they crush them. You know, famously Jack Ma who recently reappeared had sort of he's the founder of Alibaba and one of the great innovators at China just sort of disappeared and you know he was a little too vocal about his power. They started putting uh party hacks on the boards of financial firms of you know uh their tech companies. So they need to go back to this growth model where the private sector leads and the states not doing everything. But President Xi's been very reluctant to let go of that power. He's worried about instability.</p>

许多公司正在采取“**中国+1**”（China plus one: 指企业为分散风险，在维持中国业务的同时，在另一个国家建立生产基地的策略）战略，将新投资转移到其他国家。但这并非主要问题。真正的大问题是房地产暴跌，消费者恐慌，不信任政府，从而不敢消费。这才是他们增长如此缓慢的根本原因。

<p class="english-text">There is quite a bit of manufacturing moving out of China. How does this impact the situation? Well, I mean there's still quite a manufacturing force, but it's reduced invest. It's reduced investment into China. So uh it's been great for Japan, for Korea, for Singapore, Malaysia, even Indonesia and India. So as you well know, a lot of companies have this China plus one strategy, meaning we're leaving our stuff in China. And by the way, they can't get it out right now anyway. And we're going to do our new investments uh we're going to do our new investments somewhere else. But I I don't think that alone is the big thing. The big thing is that housing, real estate's plummeting. Consumers are panicked. They don't trust the government. They're not spending. That's really the big impetus of why they're so going growing so slowly.</p>

### 印度经济的崛起与挑战
印度在一段时间以来一直是一个积极的故事。他们的增长率已经超过中国，并且似乎会持续一段时间。莫迪总理终于在印度建设基础设施，为未来增长奠定基础。尽管他们仍有无数问题，比如少数垄断企业主导经济，以及高额的关税，但总体上表现不错。我对印度持乐观态度，但很难感到欣喜若狂，因为治理一个14亿人口的国家实在太难了。

I mean, uh, we can still point to a lot of problems in India, but they have faster growth rates than China. Who'd have thought that? and seemed to be for a while. Uh Modi is building infrastructure finally uh in India that you know is laying the groundwork for future growth. They still have myriad problems. A few monopolies dominate a lot of the economy. We're talking about Donald Trump's tariffs. India is already there and they they've actually come down some but you know not uh not not enough. So, you know, it's doing well. I'm optimistic but it's hard to get euphoric about India because it's just so hard to govern a country of 1.4 billion people.</p>

### 通货膨胀：卷土重来的政治经济学问题
我一直认为通货膨胀只是暂时缓解，并未消亡。我的学术论文也阐述了这一观点。我认为，在通胀非常低的时期，央行固然做得不错，但他们也很幸运。全球化、中国的崛起、以及普遍远离民粹主义政策的共识都对抑制通胀起到了帮助作用。他们是顺风而行。

<details>

<p class="english-text">How has your uh view on inflation changed over the last 10 years? So I have always thought inflation was in remission and not dead. And my academic papers have made this case. My colleagues across all of academics, I think, became in somehow mesmerized, brainwashed by central banks saying there's never going to be inflation, nothing to worry about. I think in fact the period where inflation was really low uh the central banks were good going back to Ben Larson but they were also lucky because globalization helped the rise of China helped. There was a general consensus away from populist policies more or less and that helped. They had the they had the wind at their backs.</p>
</details>

现在，他们不再顺风。不仅技术因素变了，政治环境也变了，“别管央行”的时代已经一去不复返。通胀不一定要很高，央行可以控制它。但经济学家、预测者和意见领袖们忘记了，通胀是一个政治经济学问题。如果你没有真正独立的中央银行，这是核心所在，你就会周期性地遇到麻烦。

<p class="english-text">Now they don't. And not only did they have the wind at their backs in terms of these techno factors, but the politics were leave the central bank alone. And that has been thrown by the wayside in in many countries. So inflation doesn't have to be high. The central banks can control inflation. But e economists, prognosticators, opinion makers had just forgotten that inflation's a political economy problem. And if you don't really have central bank independence, that's the core of it, you're going to periodically run into trouble.</p>

我认为2%的目标仍然可以实现，但未来五到七年内，我们将看到另一轮类似疫情后的大规模通胀爆发。这将由另一次冲击引发，届时央行将陷入困境，既要担心衰退，又要担心通胀，但政治压力将迫使他们更担心衰退。他们将无法像2008-2009年那样顶住政治压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is 2% uh still a realistic target? Well, I mean, I uh you're asking, are they going to ever get down to 2% again? I think what I think is they will but we will see in the next my book says 5 to seven years but that was the I did the page the final day of page proof was just the day after Trump got elected I might make that a little faster now than 5 to seven years there's going to be another big burst of inflation similar to what we saw in the uh after the pandemic what's going to cause that surge what's going to cause That will be another shock where the central banks are, you know, get put into a corner where they worry about recession, they worry about inflation, but the pressures are going to be towards worrying about having a recession and they're just not going to be able to stand up to the politics the way they might have say in 2008 and 2009.</p>
</details>

可能的触发因素包括网络战争、另一场大流行病，或者失控的美国债务。这些冲击会抑制增长，而政府会通过花钱来支撑消费。债务本身不会机械地转化为通胀，它会转化为更高的利率或通胀。届时，美联储将面临加息的压力。祝他们好运，即使特朗普不是总统，这也很难做到。所以我做的是一个政治经济学的判断，当情况变得艰难时，一些人会选择退缩，而不是战斗。

I'm saying that when the going gets tough, some of the, you know, some of them are going to hide and not fight the fight.</p>

### 美联储的独立性危机
很多人不理解的是，美联储不是最高法院，它没有欧洲央行那样的宪法地位。它可能在一周内消失。而且，不只是特朗普想让它消失，左翼也想。他们有各种计划，想让它印钱然后分发给民众。因此，美联储的独立性正受到来自政治光谱两端的巨大压力。

<p class="english-text">A thing a lot of people don't understand is the central this the Fed is not the Supreme Court. It does not have that kind of constitutional status that the ECB does have. And it it could disappear in a week. And by the way, it isn't just Trump that wants it to disappear. The left wants it to disappear, too. They have all these plans. They want to, you know, have it print money and give it away to people. So, there's there's a lot of pressures on on the Fed's independence coming from both sides of the spectrum.</p>
</details>

央行的独立性是一个新事物。40年前我写第一篇关于这个主题的论文时，几乎没有国家拥有独立的央行。它具有实验性，很多人认为它在降低通胀方面很有用，但现在既然通胀下来了，我们就不再需要它了。他们没有看到，正是因为有了央行的独立性，通胀才得以控制。

They were in a room in the Treasury a few people. This whole they were part of the treasury. most countries the central bank was part of the treasury. The notion of central bank independence which I by the way I think I wrote the first paper on uh just 40 years ago now and back then almost no one had independent central banks. It's new. It's experimental and there a lot of people who are saying well it's had its benefits but now that inflation's down we don't need it anymore. it we it was useful to bring inflation down. Now we don't need it, which of course, you know, they don't they don't see that that's why inflation's down because you have central bank independence.</p>

我认为，短期内我们可能会看到类似尼克松时代的价格管制。我们还会看到更多被称为“**金融抑制**”（Financial Repression: 指政府通过各种政策手段，如利率管制、资本管制等，将资金引导至政府部门，从而使储户的实际回报率低于市场水平）的措施，迫使银行和金融公司以低于其意愿的回报率持有更多政府债务。这些疯狂的事情很快就会在我们身边的舞台上演。

So I think that you know kind of wilder stuff like that is coming to a theater near you soon.</p>

### 美国国债的可持续性之辩
以目前的路径来看，美国债务问题最终将不得不通过通货膨胀来解决。过去，很多人认为利率将永远保持低位，比如拉里·萨默斯 (Larry Summers) 的“**长期停滞**”（Secular Stagnation: 指市场经济可能陷入长期需求不足、增长缓慢的困境的理论）理论。但我一直认为，低利率时期终将过去，现在它已经过去了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is the current level of US debt sustainable? Well, yes and no. I mean, uh no in the sense with on its current path, it's going to have to get resolved by inflation. Uh it's not going to get I I think again going back to my colleagues in the profession, there were these people who argued interest rates would be lower forever. Larry Summers had this I don't know if you've ever had this line in your podcast, secular stagnation. We're never going to grow again. Uh interest rates will be low. We're not inventing anything. Everybody's getting old. And I I I debated this with him uh 10 years ago. Paul Krugman, even Peter Teal, actually Gary Kasparov uh at one time. And I've always thought, you know, that people are very short. They're looking at the recent past too much. And if you look at a longer time period, you would see that this period of low interest rates was going to go away. I think it has.</p>
</details>

以我们现有的债务水平和增长速度，我们将需要进行调整。但政客们并没有让民众为此做好准备。所以我预见到，最终会伴随着一次大的冲击，比如大流行病，出现一次大规模的通货膨胀，这将在一定程度上降低债务。但这一次，利率会上升得更多。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And if it if interest rates come way down, well, any debt sustainable if you don't have to pay interest on it. But with the level we have and the uh rate it's going, we're going to need be need needing to make adjustments. I don't think politicians have prepared people to make the adjustments. So at the you know what I see happening eventually and it'll happen together with a big shock like we discussed pandemic we're going to have a a big inflation that's going to partly bring the debt down but this time interest rates are going to go up a lot more.</p>

美国今年的赤字占GDP的7%。国会预算办公室预测，目前36万亿美元的债务将在10年内增至65万亿美元。必须进行调整，要么增税，要么削减开支。左翼和右翼都在讲述一个虚构的故事：左派认为可以无限借债，右派认为减税可以自我买单。现在，利率的上升表明市场不再相信这些了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The US is running a I think it's a 7% of GDP deficit this year. I mean, and it'll come down a bit, but who knows how much. Uh, all the projections are the debts currently at 36 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office, I think, has it going to 65 trillion in 10 years. So there are lots of things you can I'm not tell I I'm not about what you should adjust. I'm not about the size of government. That's a separate question. But you know some kind of adjustments will need to be made. And one of the things that has really puzzled me throughout all this is that particularly on the left they just want to make debt really big. That's been the argument for a long time. Anyone who thinks that big debt is a problem is in favor of austerity. They think you must not want to give people stuff. And I would say no, just raise taxes. If you want to give people more stuff and bigger transfers, all for it, more power to you, but raise taxes. This whole idea of it's a free lunch. You can just give everything away. You're shooting yourself in the foot, which the Biden administration did to some extent. And on the right they say, "Oh, we can do whatever we want because when we cut taxes, growth just soarses, doesn't cost anything." And it soarses a little, but it doesn't pay for itself. So, they've both been telling this fiction, which I think now interest rates are saying the markets don't believe.</p>

### 欧洲的防务与财政挑战
我认为美国，即使是哈里斯赢得大选，也无法同时保卫欧洲、中东和亚洲。美国的国防预算已从冷战末期占GDP的8%降至现在的3.5%。我与之交谈的大多数外交政策专家都认为，美国没有能力同时在两个地区投射力量，更不用说三个了。因此，欧洲将不得不承担更多责任。这不仅仅是把国防开支提高到2%的问题，还需要弥补数十年的投资不足。这对欧洲将是一个巨大的调整。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I think the United States even if Harris had won, she was the one opposing Trump. uh is not prepared to defend Europe, the Middle East and Asia at the same time. The US defense budget which I was like 8% of GDP uh towards the end of the cold war is 3 and a half% of GDP now. I think it will go up uh again regardless of Harris or Trump winning. But uh most of the foreign policy experts I talked to think the US does not have the capacity to project power in two regions at once, much less three. And so it's going to fall to Europe to take more responsibility. And it's it's not just going to 2%. There's decades of underinvestment that need to be made up for. And that that's going to be that's going to be a big adjustment for Europe.</p>

### 人工智能的双重影响：通缩动力与社会动荡
我们绝对有可能低估了包括人工智能在内的新技术带来的通缩效应。技术可能会产生类似全球化的效果，对工资和价格构成下行压力。这是一个明显的可能性。但另一方面，我认为人工智能也将导致许多政治紧张局势和工人失业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a um could it be that we potentially underestimate the deflationary effect of new technology including AI? What do you think? Absolutely we could. Um so you know it's possible that technology will produce an effect like globalization did putting downward pressure on wages and putting downward uh pressure on prices. And that's a distinct possibility. But on the other hand, I think uh AI is also going to lead to a lot of uh political tensions, uh a lot of worker displacement.</p>
</details>

我担心的是人工智能发展的速度太快，人类将无法适应。我们显然在战争中看到了这一点，但也可能在工作场所看到。这造成了巨大的不确定性。我努力对此保持乐观，但我不认同那种“别担心通胀，因为AI会让一切变得更便宜”的观点。对央行的政治压力非常、非常强大。因此，我认为即使AI将改变我们的生活，通胀在未来几十年仍将是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yes, there's definitely a bright side to AI and I've been arguing that for for years. back when I did the debate with Peter Teal and Gary Kasparov uh just over a decade ago, they were arguing this idea there wouldn't be growth again. And I said, I'm a chess player. I see what's going on with AI. It looks to me like it's going to be good. What worries me is that it's going to be so fast. Humans, mankind, will not be able to adjust to it. And that's what worries me right now. the uh you know the potentially chaotic change that could happen with AI. We obviously see it in warfare but we may see it in the workplace as well. I I I try to be an optimist about it, but I I don't buy this idea that don't worry about inflation because this is going to make everything cheaper. These political pressures on central banks are very very powerful. So I think inflation is going to be a problem for the next several decades even though I do think AI will transform our lives.</p>

### 总结与展望：与主流相悖的观点
在很多方面，我的观点都与主流不同。我现在的主要不同观点是，我曾几乎是唯一一个认为实际利率不会永远保持低位的学术经济学家。我也曾孤立地指出，当利率上升时，今天看起来像是免费午餐的债务将不再是。我还曾是少数认为中国不会一直增长到天上去，而是会经历金融危机的人。

<p class="english-text">Where are you the most different from other economists in your views now you think? Well, where I have been different uh for some uh in many places over the years, but right now where I've been different is I was sort of all alone in arguing that real interest rates weren't going to be low forever among academic economists. I was uh alone in saying when they rise debt which seems like a free lunch today uh is not going to be I would say I was also pretty isolated in saying China was not going to grow to the moon uh that it would have a financial crisis.</p>

我在书中提出的另一个观点是，美元将不再是你习以为常的样子。它已经达到了顶峰，正在走下坡路。这个观点与共识相去甚远。我认为我们在尼克松时代已经看到了一些迹象，现在我们将再次看到。这不仅仅是美元会贬值，更是其全球足迹将会缩小。我们生活在一个美元主导的世界，美元仍将是第一，但它的地位将逐渐下降。

But uh you know that that I I've sort of discussed over the the our time here some of the reasons I thought that was true. It's not just the dollar is going to come down in value.
