### 私募信贷与AI：市场热点与担忧

**Tracy**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的 OddLots 播客。我是 **Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm **Tracy Aloway**.

</details>

**Joe**: 我是 **Joe Weisenthal**。Joe，我一直在思考 **Sam Altman** 那个关于炒作周期的说法——“结束了，然后我们又回来了”。他显然是在谈论人工智能以及人们对人工智能的感受，但我认为这个说法可以应用到当前的许多不同市场。所以，人工智能当然是其中之一，但私募信贷也是。回想一下去年年底，对吧？我们看到 **摩根大通**的 **Jamie Dimon** 所谓的“蟑螂”从私募信贷中冒出来，人们开始真正担心。快进到 2026 年 1 月，那些担忧似乎都已烟消云散。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: and I'm **Joe Wisenthal**. Joe, I keep thinking about that **Sam Alman** hype cycle kind of phrase, the whole it's over and then we're so back thing. And obviously he was talking about AI and how people, you know, feel about AI, but I think you could apply it to a bunch of different markets at the moment. So AI obviously, but also private credit. Think back to the end of last year, right? We had all the **JP Morgan**, **Jamie Diamonds**, proverbial cockroaches emerging from private credit and people started to get really worried. Fast forward to January 2026 and a lot of those concerns seem to have faded into the background.

</details>

**Tracy**: 对。你写过那篇文章，对吧？就像各地的利差都非常紧，我们已经知道今年股市上涨了，但据我了解，信贷市场开局非常强劲，各种类型的信贷都是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Right. You wrote that thing, right? Like spreads everywhere are super tight and already we know that the uh the stock market is up for the year, but credit market is off to a very strong start of all flavors from what I understand.

</details>

**Joe**: 对。股市抢走了所有风头。但如果你看看公司债券市场，这是公募债券市场，不是私募市场，利差基本上处于历史高位。我认为高收益指数今年开盘时处于其历史上最紧的水平。这太疯狂了，但也突出了一个重要观点，即利差和回报都是相对的。对吧？所以如果公募市场绝对繁荣，这对私募信贷可能是件好事，但私募信贷也与公募市场竞争，对吧？所以如果你在公募信贷或杠杆贷款等领域获得相当不错的回报，也许你就不会像以前那样大量进入私募信贷了。如果你发现一所房子里只有一只蟑螂呢？那会是……你能想象吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Right. Stock markets stealing all the spotlight. But if you look at the corporate bond market, now this is the public bond market, not private, but spreads are, you know, at basically historic heights. I think the uh the high yield index is starting at its like tightest level ever in the history of the index for the year. This is crazy, but it also highlights an important point which is that spreads and returns are all relative. Yeah. Right. And so if the public market is absolutely booming, that could be a good thing for private credit, but also private credit competes with the public market, right? So if you're getting pretty good returns in public credit or leverage loans, something like that, maybe you're not going into private credit as much as you used to. What if you found a house that just had one cockroach? That would be Could you imagine?

</details>

**Tracy**: 永远不会只有一只蟑螂。这就是重点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: There's never one cockroach. That's the point.

</details>

**Joe**: 肯定有第一只蟑螂进入了房子。你很快就能抓住它，然后你就没有蟑螂问题了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: There had to have been a first cockroach that enters the house. You get it really quickly in your uh and then you don't have a cockroach problem.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我有没有告诉过你我有多讨厌蟑螂？首先，我 14 岁搬回日本时，重新学会的第一个日语单词就是“kokori hoy hoy”，因为我必须去当地的便利店买蟑螂屋，因为整个公寓都闹蟑螂了。其次，我太讨厌蟑螂了，我曾经读了一整本关于蟑螂的书，只是为了知己知彼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Did I ever tell you I hate cockroaches so much. The first of all, the first Japanese word I ever relearned when I moved back to Japan as like a 14-year-old was kokori hoy hoy because I had to go down to the local kambini, the convenience store, and buy cockroach hotels because the entire apartment was infested. And secondly, I hate cockroaches so much. I once uh read an entire book about cockroaches just to know my enemy.

</details>

**Joe**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Wow.

</details>

**Tracy**: 那本书有 300 多页，全是关于蟑螂的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: It was like 300 pages on cockroach.

</details>

**Joe**: 我们应该请作者来播客吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Should we get the author on the podcast?

</details>

**Tracy**: 哦，那真是一本好书。它是一项关于蟑螂历史的文化和科学研究。但无论如何，我们跑题太远了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Oh, it was actually a really good book. It was a sort of like cultural and scientific study of the history of cockroaches. But anyway, we are getting massively off topic.

</details>

**Joe**: 我来介绍一下我们的嘉宾吧？事实上，我们请到了最完美的嘉宾。好的，我们将讨论所有关于私募信贷的事情，包括私募信贷目前如何与人工智能领域相关联。我们正在与 **Michael Zawadzki** 对话，他也被称为 **Z**。他是 **黑石信贷**的全球首席投资官。那么 **Z**，非常感谢您来到播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Shall I introduce our guest? We do, in fact, have the perfect guest. All right, so we're going to be talking all things private credit, including how private credit is relating to the AI space. At the moment, we're speaking with **Michael Zawatsky**, also known as **Z**. He is the global chief investment officer for **Blackstone Credit**. So **Z**, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

</details>

**Z**: 非常荣幸来到这里。谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Wonderful to be here. Thanks for having me.

### 黑石集团的私募信贷增长之路

**Tracy**: 您的 **黑石集团**的优秀代表告诉我，在过去的 20 年里，您已将 **黑石集团**的信贷业务发展成为 **黑石集团**资产规模最大的业务。这有多难？您只是顺应了企业发行的浪潮吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So I am told by your uh lovely **Blackstone** representatives that over the last 20 years you have grown **Blackstone's** credit franchise into the largest business by assets at **Blackstone**. How hard was that? Were you just sort of like riding a wave of corporate issuance?

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，我们来谈谈这里发生的一些事情。我经常被问到私募信贷的增长，我认为存在一个误解，即这种增长是由过度冒险驱动的。但当你真正退一步思考市场中发生的事情时，你会发现基本上出现了一项创新突破，它改变了业务的运作方式，对所有市场参与者都更好。我喜欢把它比作 **亚马逊**在零售领域所做的事情。对吧？在 **亚马逊**出现之前，如果你想买东西，你必须去商店。但 **亚马逊**消除了中间商，将消费者直接带到制造商面前，并在此过程中创造了一种更简单、更高效、对经济更有利、更透明的东西。私募信贷做了什么？它做了同样的事情。它直接将借款人带到我们投资者的资本面前。我们有时称之为“从农场到餐桌”模式，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, let's talk about a few things that have happened here. You know, I often get asked about this growth of private credit and I think there's a misconception that that growth was driven by excess risk-taking. But when you actually step back and think about what's happened in the market, you basically had a innovative breakthrough that changed the way business was done that was better for all market participants. The way I like to analogize it to is what happened with **Amazon** in the retail space. Right? Before **Amazon**, if you wanted to go buy something, you had to go to the store. But **Amazon** kind of took out that middleman and brought you the consumer directly to the manufacturer and in the process created something that was simpler, more efficient, better for the economy, more transparent. What's private credit done? It's done the same thing. It's brought the borrower right up directly to our investors capital. We sometimes call it this farm-to-table model, right?

</details>

**Z**: 你在这个过程中做了什么？你砍掉了所有的中间商，所有的银团贷款，所有的交易台，所有那些导致过程中资金流失的东西。在这个过程中，你建立了一个对所有市场参与者都更好的东西。如果你是借款人，你可以直接与你的贷款人对话。你得到一个定制的解决方案。你获得速度，执行的确定性。如果你是投资者，你以更高回报的形式捕获了所有那些多余的资金流失。在过去的 20 年里一直如此。顺便说一句，如果你是金融市场，你拥有一个杠杆更低、资产负债管理更完善的生态系统，为整个生态系统带来了更多的金融稳定性。当你拥有一个对所有市场参与者都真正有利的东西时，它往往会大幅增长，这就是私募信贷中发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: What have you done in that process? You've cut out all the middlemen, all the syndication, all the trading desks, all the stuff that led to leakage along the way. And in the process, you built something that was better for all market participants. If you're a borrower, you get to speak directly to your lender. You get a customized solution. You get speed, certainty of execution. If you're an investor, you capture all of that excess leakage in the form of higher returns. And that's been the case for the last 20 years. And by the way, if you're the financial markets, you have an ecosystem that is less levered, more asset liability management, brings more financial stability to the overall ecosystem. When you have something that's really good for all market participants, it tends to grow a lot and that's what's happened in private credit.

</details>

**Joe**: 在这个我非常喜欢的类比中，相当于“网络”的是什么？对吧？所以 **亚马逊**之所以能够砍掉实体书店或各种其他零售商等，是因为互联网的存在，它解决了某些信息问题等。您会如何描述现在存在的那种东西，使得如此多的中间商等可以被砍掉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: What is the equivalent of like in this analogy which I really like, what is the equivalent of the web, right? So the reason **Amazon** could cut out the physical bookstore or the various other retailers etc is because the internet exists and that create solves some information problems etc. How would you describe the sort of like the thing that exists now such that so many different middlemen and so forth can be cut out

</details>

**Z**: 规模。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: scale. Okay.

</details>

**Joe**: 规模，对吧？我们今天能做的事情，20 年前做不到，是因为我们没有资本基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Scale, right? The reason we couldn't do what we do today

</details>

**Z**: 20 年前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: 20 years ago

</details>

**Joe**: 是因为我们没有资本基础。我们无法完成一笔超过 10 亿美元的交易。这里有一个有趣的事实。在 2021 年之前，历史上只有 5 笔超过 50 亿美元的私募信贷交易。自 2021 年以来，已经有 100 多笔，而我们 **黑石集团**完成了其中大部分。那么，这意味着什么？我们拥有足够的资本规模来实际解决客户的问题。我们拥有广泛的团队来覆盖市场，并将这些解决方案直接带给我们的借款人。然后，发生的另一件事是私募信贷的扩展，超越了许多人认为的范围，即中端市场发起人支持的直接贷款，进入我们所说的“实体经济”。对吧？将今天价值 2 万亿美元的市场，扩展到 30 万亿美元以上的潜在市场，当你考虑私募投资级实物资产和资产支持融资等领域时。所以，这其中另一个重要部分就是潜在市场的巨大扩张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: is cuz we didn't have the capital base. We couldn't write a billion dollar plus deal. Here's an interesting fact. Before 2021, there were only $5 billion plus private credit deals done ever. Since 2021, 100 plus, and we at **Blackstone** have done most of them. So, what does that mean? We have the scale of capital to actually solve the problems for our clients. we have the breath of team to go out and cover the market and bring these solutions direct to our borrowers. And then the other thing that's happened is the expansion of private credit beyond what a lot of people think of it as which is middle market sponsor back direct lending into what we call the real economy. Right? taking what is a$ two trillion dollar market today and thinking about a 30 plus trillion dollar addressable market when you think about areas like private investment grade real assets assetbacked finance and so the other big piece of this is just the massive expansion in the addressable market that's come about

</details>

**Tracy**: 我理解您关于定制化融资解决方案以及让投资者更接近资本的观点，但与此同时，随着基础的增长，对交易的竞争也会加剧，那时您就会开始看到，不仅可能利差降低，而且杠杆也会增加。我们已经看到一些优先留置权现在变成了统一债权，以及其他通常会引起一些担忧的事情。您在市场中看到这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: so I take the point about you know customized financing solutions and bringing investors closer to capital and all of that but at the same time like the concern is that as the base grows, competition for deals increases and that's when you start to see not just potentially lower spreads but also more leverage and we have seen you know some first leans that are now uni trenches and things that would normally spark a little bit of worry. Is that something that you're seeing in the market?

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，这很有趣。你看，我从事私募信贷已经二十年了。回想我们 20 年前首次进行的私募信贷交易，我会告诉你，我不知道其中任何一笔交易今天是否能通过我们的投资委员会。它们规模小，周期性强，基本上是银行不愿做的东西。快进到今天。想想我们做的平均直接贷款交易。它是一个拥有 2 亿美元息税前利润的业务。贷款价值比是 40%。全球金融危机前，交易的贷款价值比超过 65%。所以，当我思考今天高级担保贷款的风险状况时，相对于历史而言，感觉相当不错。然后，这还需要结合这样一个事实：我们 **黑石集团**在信贷领域看到的投资级私募信贷机会，我认为是增长最快的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, it's funny. Look, I've been doing private credit for two decades. I think back to the deals that we were first doing in private credit 20 years ago and I would tell you I don't know that a single one of them would pass our investment committee today. They were small. They were cyclical. They were basically the stuff the banks wouldn't do. Fast forward to today. Think about the average direct lending deal we do. It's a $200 million EBIT business. It's 40% loan to value. PreGf loan to values on deals were 65% plus. And so when I think about the risk posture of a senior secured loan today, it feels pretty good relative to history. And then that needs to be combined with the fact that this opportunity in investment grade private credit I would say is the fastest growing opportunity we see in credit at **Blackstone**.

</details>

### AI基础设施融资的机遇

**Tracy**: 对吧？所以这是正在发生的另一个新事物，那就是投资级私募信贷。所以，你知道，私募信贷扩展到拥有非常良好资产负债表的公司，而不是垃圾评级公司，已经变得越来越普遍。它正在走向主流，其中很大一部分是由 AI 相关发行和科技相关发行驱动的。请多谈谈您在该领域看到的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Right? So this is the other new thing that's happening is uh IG private credit. So, you know, private credit extended to companies with very good balance sheets, not junk rated, uh, has become more of a thing. It's going mainstream and a lot of that is driven by AI issuance and techreated issuance. Talk more about what you're seeing in that space.

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，我认为这是很大一部分，对吧？每当你看到对资本有巨大需求时，我们显然在数据中心建设中看到了这一点，然后与此相关的所有能源、电力和基础设施都需要伴随其发展。你看到了巨大的资本需求，而需要如此多资本的市场需要获取所有可用的选项，这包括公募信贷，但也包括私募信贷。**摩根士丹利**去年年底发布了一份报告，估计未来五年仅数字基础设施建设就需要 **8000亿美元**的私募信贷融资。好的，这是一个巨大的数字。我认为当人们思考例如数据中心融资的融资要素时，他们会错过一点，那就是我们正在为 15-20 年的照付不议合同提供融资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, I think that's a big part of it, right? Anytime you see a significant need for capital which we obviously see in the data center buildout and then connected to that all the energy power and infrastructure that needs to uh accompany that. You see huge capital needs and markets that need that much capital need to access all available options and that includes public credit but that also includes private credit. **Morgan Stanley** put out a piece late last year that estimated that $800 billion of private credit alone is needed to finance the digital infrastructure build out over the next 5 years. Okay, so that's a massive number. I think what gets missed when people think about the financing element of financing a data center for example is we're financing 15 20-year take-or-pay contracts with

</details>

**Tracy**: 照付不议合同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: take pay contract

</details>

**Z**: 意思是，想想三净租赁合同。无论你的使用量是多少，无论你的运营成本是多少，你每个月都会从租户那里获得一笔固定金额，而且他们不能退出合同。好的？你从世界上一些最高质量的信用对手方那里获得这些。对吧？超大规模公司是当今大多数数据中心的租户。所以，当我戴着信贷的帽子时，如果我可以针对世界上一些最好的对手方，针对已知明确的现金流，并且我可以以比同等评级的公募信贷高出 150 到 200 个基点的额外利差来放贷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: meaning think about a triple net lease contract. No matter what your usage is, no matter what your operating costs are, you're getting a fixed sum every single month from your tenant and they can't get out of that contract. Okay? And you're getting that from some of the highest quality credit counterparties in the world, right? Hyperscalers are the tenants in most of the data centers today. And so as I sit with my credit hat on, if I can lend against some of the best counterparties in the world against a known defined stream of cash flows and I can do that with 150 to 200 basis points of excess spread versus like rated public credit.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。抱歉，请解释一下。所以，我们世界上最值得信赖的公司是这些现金流充裕的公司，大型科技公司等等。我仍然不太明白，私募信贷市场对它们有什么优势？正如您所提到的，利差更宽。它们可以进入债券市场。它们一直都在这样做，或者它们当然可以。那么，私募信贷为像 **Meta** 和 **苹果**这样的公司解决了什么问题，以至于它们不能通过公募信贷市场借款？定制化，好的，速度，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. Well, sorry, explain that. So, we the uh most creditworthy companies in the worlds are these cash flow gushers, the big tech companies, etc. What is the I still don't quite get what is the advantage for them of the private credit market spreads as you mentioned are wider. They can access the bond market. They do it all the time or they certainly can. So what is the what does private credit solve for the meadows of the world and the apples of the world such that they can't borrow um versus the public credit market? Customization, okay, speed,

</details>

**Z**: 确定性、灵活性，直接为借款人提供解决方案。有时在时间或其他方面存在某些要素，需要私下解决方案，保密性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: certainty, flexibility, bringing that solution direct to the borrower. Sometimes there's certain elements in terms of the timing or whatever the case may be that requires a private solution, confidentiality.

</details>

**Tracy**: 您能进一步解释一下吗？比如，当您说“定制化”时，这些项目具体有什么特点？人们总是说定制化。给我们一个具体的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Can you just explain that a little further? Like what is it about these projects specifically when you say like customization? People say customization all the time. Give us a specific example.

</details>

**Z**: 好的。嗯，有时会有建设要素。好的。所以，你需要随着时间的推移进行融资，而不是在第一天就投入所有资本。这是一个很好的例子，对吧？有时你需要以某种方式进行结构化，嗯，在现金流的时间安排方面。这是另一个例子。所以，有些需求不一定会增加信用风险，但它们不符合投资级公募债券的标准化模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Okay. Well, sometimes there's a construction element. Okay. So, you need to fund over time as opposed to funding all of your capital day one. That's a good example, right? Sometimes you need to structure in a certain way um in terms of the timing of the cash flows. That's another example. So there are things that are needed that don't necessarily increase credit risk, but they don't fit the cookie cutter mold of a straight away investment grade public bond.

</details>

### 黑石集团的AI敞口与策略

**Tracy**: 这可能是一个难以回答的问题，但当您审视自己的投资组合，您非常庞大的投资组合时，您能大致估计一下多年来 AI 敞口增加了多少吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So this might be a difficult question to answer, but when you look at your own portfolio, your own very large portfolio, can you give like a rough estimate of how much AI exposure has increased over the years?

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，这是一个引人入胜的问题，对吧？因为我倾向于非常广泛地思考 AI 敞口，对吧？因为我认为 AI 不仅会影响数据中心和直接的、你知道的、一级衍生影响，还会影响二级衍生影响和三级衍生影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, that's a fascinating question, right? Because um I tend to think about AI exposure pretty broadly, right? cuz I think AI will impact not just data centers and the direct um you know um first derivative impact but the second derivative impact the third derivative impact.

</details>

**Joe**: 所以您也在关注可能受到颠覆的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: So you're looking at companies that could be disrupted as well.

</details>

**Z**: 我们正在关注所有这些，而且我们一直在关注所有这些，这是在 **黑石集团**工作的一部分，对吧？我们对全球所有这些市场正在发生的事情有令人难以置信的洞察力，不仅在我们拥有 5000 多个借款人的信贷业务中，还有我们的私募股权业务、基础设施业务、房地产业务。我们恰好拥有世界上几个最大的数据中心开发商。我们有一个庞大的运营团队，帮助公司实施 AI 能力，帮助它们在需要时进行进攻和防守。因此，我们利用所有这些资源，我思考 AI 对我们投资组合中几乎所有业务的影响，程度各不相同。但我认为作为投资者，你必须积极主动地思考这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: We're looking at it all and we have been looking at it all and this is this is part of working at **Blackstone**, right? Like we have unbelievable insights into what's going on all around the globe in all of these markets, not just within our credit business that has 5,000 plus borrowers, but our private equity business, our infrastructure business, our real estate business. We happen to own a couple of the largest data center developers in the world. We have a huge operating team that helps companies implement uh AI capabilities, help them play offense and defense when needed. And so we leverage all of these res resources and I think about AI impact across almost every business in our portfolio to varying degrees. But I think you have to be front-footed in thinking about that as an investor.

</details>

**Tracy**: 那么直接敞口呢？我们先不谈二级衍生品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: What about direct exposure to let's forget about second derivatives.

</details>

**Joe**: 我理解您的观点，但我之所以问这个问题，是因为像保险公司这样的地方存在一些关于集中度限制的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I take the point but like the reason I'm asking is because there are some concerns around concentration limits at places like insurers.

</details>

**Z**: 是的。你看，我们在 **黑石集团**拥有超过 **5000亿美元**的资产和信贷，我会告诉你，直接数据中心敞口的金额只占其中很小一部分。它不会达到让我们的任何客户感到集中度过高的水平。那么，除了正式的集中度限制之外，就日常业务而言，现在或过去一年中，您会说有多少新活动与数据中心或可能是一些电力融资相关，这些电力融资也是数据中心所必需的。你看，嗯，我会告诉你，这占我们工作的重要一部分，因为它是一个资本密集型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Yeah. Look, we have over $500 billion dollar of assets uh and credit at **Blackstone** and I would tell you like the the amount of direct data center exposure is is a small minority of that. It would not rise to the level of something where any of our clients would feel like they have concentration. What about in terms of setting aside like formal concentration limits just in terms of like on a day-to-day business right now or over the last year how much of new new activity would you say is related to either sort of data centers or maybe some of the power uh yeah the power financing that is also needed for data centers. Look, um I would tell you it's a material portion of what we're doing because it is such a capital intensive.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah.

</details>

**Z**: 信贷密集型市场的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Credit intensive part of the market.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah.

</details>

**Z**: 但当我思考我们在信贷业务中正在做的一切时，它并没有显示出显著超配。例如，如果我思考我们在私募投资级业务中正在做的事情，那是一个广义上的实物资产策略，对吧？它显然包括数字基础设施。它包括能源和电力，但它也包括住宅抵押贷款，这是一个巨大的资产类别。它包括设备融资。我们最近刚刚宣布了一项交易，嗯，进行飞机发动机合作。坦率地说，我认为它所包含的最大一项是我们所说的企业解决方案。这些是与公募投资级公司的大规模定制化私募信贷合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: But when I think about everything we're doing across our business and credit, it doesn't it doesn't screen as something that's, you know, significantly overweight. Like if I think about what we're doing in our private investment grade business, that's a real asset strategy broadly defined, right? That includes obviously digital infrastructure. It includes energy and power, but it includes residential mortgages, which is a massive asset class. It includes equipment finance. We just announced a deal recently um to do to do an aircraft engine partnership. And frankly, I'd say the single biggest thing that it includes is what we call corporate solutions. And these are largecale customized private credit partnerships with public investment grade companies.

</details>

**Z**: 所以最近我们与加拿大 **罗杰斯**公司达成了一项交易，我们为他们提供了 **50亿美元**的融资，用于他们的网络基础设施回程。然后，我们去年年底与 **塞拉基础设施**公司达成了一项交易，帮助他们建设一个液化天然气项目。我们不仅在美国看到了这种情况，在全球范围内也看到了。事实上，我们昨天与欧洲超市公司 **阿霍德**宣布了一项交易，帮助他们扩展物流版图。所以，我会告诉你，我在我们的私募投资级业务中看到的最大主题就是我们所说的企业解决方案这一概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: And so recently we did a deal with **Rogers** up in Canada where we did a $5 billion financing for them against their network infrastructure back hall. We then did a deal late last year with **Serra Infrastructure** to help them build out an LNG project. And we're seeing that not just in the US, we're seeing that globally. We announced a deal yesterday in fact with **Ahold**, the the European supermarket company to help expand their logistics footprint. And so I would tell you the biggest theme I see across our private investment grade business is this notion of what we call corporate solutions.

</details>

### 私募信贷的风险管理与市场展望

**Tracy**: 嗯，目前交易的来源情况如何？所以 **黑石集团**显然非常大。所以我猜人们会不断地来找您，但与此同时，我们听到的一种情况是，当私募信贷市场非常非常火热时，

**Tracy**: Um what's it like sourcing deals at the moment? So **Blackstone** obviously very big. So I imagine people are coming to you constantly but at the same time one of the things we heard when the private credit market was very very hot was

</details>

**Joe**: 交易竞争非常激烈，每个人都想参与某些融资交易。那么情况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: there's a lot of competition for deals right and everyone wants um in on certain financing transactions. So what's it like?

</details>

**Z**: 你必须逐个市场来看，对吧？我们刚才谈论的是私募投资级企业解决方案，一些大型基础设施信贷领域。我会告诉你，在那个市场，对资本的需求大于像 **黑石集团**这样有能力满足这些需求的参与者。所以，在那个市场，我会告诉你，我们有强劲的交易活动，而且在那个市场，我看到了大量的额外利差。我知道您之前提到利差很紧。但在那个领域，我会说利差实际上相当有吸引力，对吧？如果你考虑一下今天公募投资级利差是 80 个基点。如果你能在同等信用评级的风险中获得 250 个基点，那是一个很大的相对额外利差，之所以会发生这种情况，是因为资本需求相对于资本供应而言非常有吸引力，这作为贷款人对我们来说是显而易见的。我会说在直接贷款市场，嗯，这是一个利差随着流动性次投资级市场而收紧的市场，但额外利差仍然存在，即那几百个基点的额外利差持续存在。我认为有所帮助的是，你正在看到交易活动的增加，我们去年下半年看到了非常强劲的并购活动，如果我看看我们第四季度的项目储备，它实际上比去年同期增长了 25%，我认为我们对交易活动的强劲复苏持乐观态度，这将有助于您在那个市场专门寻找交易的观点。我认为另一件非常重要的事情是，您问过关于我们如何扩大业务规模的问题，其中一部分不仅仅是等待电话响起。我们工作的一个重要部分是思考 **黑石集团**所有业务中，不仅仅是信贷业务，我们希望部署资本的主题领域，以及数字基础设施、能源和电力。这些是投资级领域的好例子，但次投资级领域也有先进的例子。生命科学、公用事业服务。我们的团队所做的是，我们主动识别这些公司，并向它们推销定制化解决方案。因为我们拥有足够的资本规模来实际解决这个问题，所以我们可以做到这一点。我们去年年底与一家名为 **Signant Health** 的生命科学公司达成了一项交易，这是一笔超过 10 亿美元的交易，由我们牵头。我们是如何做到的？嗯，我们为他们的头号竞争对手提供了融资。我们跟踪了这笔贷款，因为我们将其保留在我们的流动性账簿中。所以，我们有了这个想法，嘿，我们给这家公司打电话，说你们应该做一笔私募贷款。这就是创意产生的地方。这也是市场差异化所在。很多人都能拿起电话。

**Z**: You got to take it market by market, right? We were just talking about private investment grade corporate solutions, some of these big infrastructure credit areas. I would tell you in that market there is more demand for capital than there are players like **Blackstone** with the scale to actually meet those needs. And so that is a market where I would tell you we have robust deal activity and that is a market where I see a lot of excess spread. I know you mentioned earlier that spreads are tight. That's an area where I would say spreads are actually quite attractive, right? If you think about public IG spreads today are 80 basis points. If you can make 250 basis points in like forl like credit rated risk like that's a lot of relative excess spread and that's happening because the demand for capital relative to the supply of capital is quite attractive and that's showing up for us as lenders. I'd say in the direct lending market um that's a market where spreads have tightened in sympathy with the liquid subinvestment grade markets but the excess spread remains right that excess spread of a couple hundred basis points persists I think what is helping is you are seeing this increase in deal activity we saw very strong M&A activity in the back half of last year if I look at our Q4 pipeline it's actually up 25% versus what it was at this time last year and I think we are optimistic about a strong recovery in deal activity that will help on your point in terms of sourcing deals in that market specifically. I think the other thing that's really important and and you asked this question around how do we scale a business part of it is not just waiting and sitting for the phone to ring. A huge part of what we do is think about the thematic areas within all of **Blackstone**, not just credit that we want to deploy capital in and digital infra energy and power. Those are good examples in the investment grade space, but there are also advance examples in the subinvestment grade space. Life sciences, utility services. And what our team does is we proactively identify these companies and pitch them customized solutions. And because we have the scale of capital to actually solve that problem, we can do that. We did a deal late last year with a company called **Signant Health** in the life sciences space, a billion-dollar plus transaction that we led. How did we do that? Well, we had financed their number one competitor. We had followed this loan because we had held it in our liquid book. And so, we had the idea, hey, let's call this company and say, you should do a private loan. And that's where the idea Asian comes. And that's where the differentiation in the market comes. A lot of people can pick up the phone.

</details>

**Joe**: 并不是很多人都能创造自己的想法并真正实现它们。我认为这是我们独有的优势。一切都像是规模和幂律，以及通过增长和拥有那个网络而产生的复合回报，强者愈强，这确实是一件非凡的事情，我们在科技领域看到了，但在金融领域也清晰可见。我认为，你知道，市场份额归属于最大参与者的百分比，嗯，显然是一个优势。显然，我们想更多地谈论整个行业，回到你提到的“结束了，我们又回来了”的周期。所以去年年底，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Not a lot of people can create their own ideas and actually affectuate them. And I think that's something we're uniquely good at. everything is just sort of like scale and power laws and compounding return from having grown and having ha having that network the big get bigger it's really such an extraordinary thing and we see it in tech but we also clearly see it in finance I think with like you know the percentage of market share that acrru to the biggest players um clearly an advantage obviously want to talk more about the industry overall going back to you know Tracy mentioned that we're so it's so over we're so back or so or so cycle. So at the end of last year

</details>

**Tracy**: 有两件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: there were two things

</details>

**Joe**: 嗯，有两起类似“爆雷”事件，但都与汽车有关。所以，嗯，**Tricolor**，我不知道我发音对不对 **Tricolor**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: um there were like two like kind of blowups um in but both were both related to autos. So uh treellor I don't know if I'm pronouncing triricor

</details>

**Tracy**: 那是那种我发音时会觉得自己很蠢的词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: that's one of those words where I feel like very stupid pronouncing it the right way.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的，我也是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah I do too.

</details>

**Joe**: 我想，我应该直接说 **Tricolor** 吗？我不知道。所以有 **Tricolor**，然后是 **First Brands**，我相当确定我发音正确。然后，嗯，那是在汽车领域，然后还有一些在 5 分钟内病毒式传播的事情。有一些关于芯片的事情，也许它们贬值速度会比人们预期的快，很多人会为此买单，我把这个放在一边。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: And I'm like, should I just sayricolor like I don't So there was a precolor and then **First Brands** which I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing correctly. And then there was like so that was like in the auto space and then there was all the stuff that went viral for about 5 minutes. There was something about the chips and maybe they're going to depreciate faster than people expect and a bunch of people are going to be holding the bag and I racket that out aside.

</details>

**Tracy**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Okay.

</details>

**Joe**: 你在汽车领域看到了那些爆雷事件。**Jamie Dimon** 带着“蟑螂”出现了。您对那一刻的看法是什么？有没有理由认为还有更多的 **Tricolor** 存在？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: You get those uh blowups and the auto area. **Jamie Diamond** comes out with the cockroaches. What was your read on that moment? Was there reason to think that there are more trol out there?

</details>

**Z**: 我会告诉你，当所有这些事情发生时，我们都摸不着头脑。我们摸不着头脑的最大原因是，所有这些例子都是由银行牵头、银行银团、银行承销的交易，不知何故被与私募信贷混淆了。这对我们来说是最大的挫败感，因为我们审视了这些交易，我们说：“嘿，私募信贷的优势之一是你可以进行私人层面的尽职调查。你可以接触管理团队。你可以进行数周的工作。你可以私下获取信息。”所以我们观察到的一点是存在这种误解，这就是为什么我们认为继续就公募信贷和私募信贷之间的区别进行教育如此重要，而那些情况是公募信贷。我认为另一件人们可能没有意识到的事情是，虽然私募信贷最近受到了很多关注，但私募信贷已经存在很长时间了。你可以看看私募信贷 20 年的回报，你会发现它们在 20 年间，在整个周期中，都比流动性信贷高出几百个基点。此外，你还可以看看，在那个 20 年期间，该行业的实际损失率为 1%。所以，我认为我们关注数据，我们关注澄清，但我认为最后一件同样重要的事情是，次投资级信贷中会发生违约。我认为这是另一件被人们忽视的事情。人们看到关于信贷问题的头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: I would tell you when all of that was going down, we were scratching our heads. And the biggest reason we were scratching our heads were all of those examples were bankled, bagg syndicated, baggwritten deals that somehow got confused with private credit. And this is the biggest frustration for us because we looked at those deals and we said, "Hey, one of the advantages of private credit is you can actually do private level due diligence. You can get access to management team. You can do weeks of work. You can get private access to information." And so one of our observations there was there was this misconception and that's why we think it's so important to continue to educate on the distinctions between public credit and private credit and those situations um were public credit. I think the other thing that I think people maybe maybe don't appreciate is while private credit has gotten a lot of attention recently, private credit's been around for a long time. You can look at 20-year returns in private credit and you can see that they've outperformed liquid credit by several hundred basis points over 20 years through cycles. Also, you can look at the fact that realized losses over that 20-year period for the industry have been 1%. And so I think we look to the data, we look to the clarification, but then I think the last thing that's also important to highlight here is defaults happen in sub investment grade credit. And I think this is the other thing that I think gets missed. People see a headline about a credit issue.

</details>

**Joe**: 我们的投资组合中有数千个信贷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: We have thousands of credit in our portfolios.

</details>

**Z**: 其中一些会出现问题。这是正常的。如果你看看杠杆贷款市场和公募高收益市场的长期违约率，它是 3%。这些事情会发生。我们在承销中考虑了它们。我们在如何标记我们的投资组合中考虑了它们。最重要的是，我们有资源来处理这些情况。我们有运营人员。我们有一个庞大的重组团队。如果我们的账簿中确实存在挑战，我认为就您的规模观点而言，Joe，拥有 **黑石集团**的实力，**黑石集团**的资源和智力资本来实际支持这些公司，并为我们的投资者带来长期良好的结果，这才是最重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Some of them are going to have issues. That is normal. If you look at the long-term default rate in the leverage loan market, in the public high yield market, it's 3%. These things happen. We account for them in our underwriting. We account for them in how we mark our portfolio. And most importantly, we have the resources to deal with those situations. We have operating people. We've got a big workout team. And if we do have challenges in our book, I think to your point on scale, Joe, having the strength of **Blackstone**, the resource and intellectual capital of **Blackstone** to actually support those companies and drive good outcomes for our investors over term, that's what matters.

</details>

**Joe**: 我理解您关于 20 年回报的观点，但你知道，20 年前，私募信贷行业几乎不存在，对吧？然后我们基本上经历了 17 年的牛市，除了 2020 年的五分钟。嗯，风险资产经历了 17 年的牛市。所以我不认为说“是的，回报是真实的，它们确实带来了回报，违约率很低，违约确实会发生”是疯狂的，但我不认为完全不怀疑我们是否正处于一个转折点是疯狂的，因为在某种程度上，如果 20 年的记录中有 17 年或多或少处于不间断的牛市中，你只能将它推断到这个程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: just uh I take your point about the 20-year returns, but you know, 20 years ago, the private credit industry barely existed, right? And then we've basically had a 17-year bull market except for five minutes in 2020. Um a 17-year bull market in risk assets. So I don't think it's crazy to say like yes the returns they're real they deliver the defaults are low defaults happen but I don't think it's totally crazy to wonder if you're a turning point because there's to some extent you can only take a 20-year track record so far if 17 years of them were in more or less a non-stop bull market.

</details>

**Z**: 所以这是我看到的。首先，我认为市场上会发生的是，私募信贷将继续增长，你将继续看到强劲的私募信贷表现。话虽如此，你是对的。如果我展望未来而不是回顾过去，我认为你有理由相信你会在资产类别中看到更多的分散。你会看到一些参与者表现不佳。你会看到一些参与者有更高的损失。我不认为这意味着整个资产类别将面临挑战，因为我们最初使用的 **亚马逊**类比模型仍然存在。相对于流动性市场的额外利差是持久的。我们的客户访问私募信贷以及直接贷款之外所有这些新领域的方式，我们正处于那条非常非常漫长道路的开端。所以我认为私募信贷的长期论点是完整的。顺便说一句，除了经济衰退，你不会看到大规模的违约潮。而且对我来说，我们似乎没有走向经济衰退。当我看到企业盈利增长，当我看到消费者状况，当我看到财政和货币刺激时，这些都没有指向经济衰退。所以当我展望未来时，我没有看到行业出现这个大的转折点。我看到了行业的持续增长。但我确实看到了更多的分散，这是一件好事。如果你考虑所有成熟的资产类别，你都有顶尖的四分之一管理者和垫底的四分之一管理者。所以我认为这个资产类别将更多地关注谁更擅长发起交易，谁更擅长管理投资组合中的挑战，谁拥有最广泛的视野来识别广义信贷领域中客户可以部署的、存在额外利差的、存在更好风险调整后回报的领域。我认为这就是我们正在进入的时代，我会说我们强烈拥抱那个时代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: So here's what I see. First off, what I think will happen in the market is that you will continue to see private credit grow and you will continue to see strong private credit performance. That said, you're right. If I look forward versus looking back, I think you it's reasonable to believe that you will see more dispersion in the asset class. You will see some players underperform. You will see some players have higher losses. I don't think that means the entire asset class will face challenges because the model like we started with that **Amazon** analogy that still persists. The excess spread versus liquid markets that is durable. The way our clients access private credit and all of these new areas beyond direct lending, we're at the very very beginning of that very very long road. And so I think the long-term thesis for private credit is intact. By the way, you don't see massive waves of defaults outside of recessions. And it doesn't feel like to me we're headed into a recession. When I look at corporate um earnings growth, when I look at where consumers are, when I look at fiscal and monetary stimulus, none of that points to recession to me. And so when I look forward, I don't see we I don't see this big turning point for the industry. I see continued growth in the industry. But what I do see is more dispersion which is a good thing. If you think about all established asset classes, you have top quartile managers and you have bottom cortile managers. And so I think the asset class will be a lot more about who is better at originating deals, who is better at managing challenges in their portfolio, who has the broadest aperture to identify areas within credit broadly defined where clients can deploy where there is excess spread, where there is better risk adjusted returns. I think that's the era we're heading into and I would say we strongly embrace that era.

</details>

**Tracy**: 好的。所以您认为不会出现大量违约，但责任管理操作或仅仅是债务重组呢？因为这种情况偶尔会发生。如果您看看私募信贷的违约率，我认为官方数据低于 2% 左右。但如果您加上我们在 **First Brands** 等公司看到的责任管理操作，它会更高。我认为它会达到 5% 左右。您是否预计随着这种分散效应的显现，会有更多公司重组债务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Okay. So you don't see lots of defaults coming up, but what about liability management exercises or just restructuring debt? Because this is something that comes up occasionally. If you look at the default rate for private credit, I think officially it's below 2% something like that. But if you add back in the liability management exercises that we've seen at places like **First Brands**, um it goes higher. I think it goes to like 5% or something like that. Would you expect more companies to be restructuring debt as this dispersion effect maybe feeds through?

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，我认为有两点我想在这里详细说明。第一，责任管理这个概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, I think there's two pieces I want to unpack there. One, this whole notion of liability management.

</details>

**Z**: 它确实是一种公募市场现象，它存在于公募市场中，因为公募信贷文件非常薄弱，对吧？它们没有私募信贷中拥有的相同契约保护。所以，你可能会有债务堆叠在你前面。你可能会有抵押品被剥离。这就是公募市场中许多情况发生的原因。幸运的是，在私募信贷中，文件更具保护性。所以，我认为你会在私募信贷市场中看到更少的这种激进行为，当然是相对于公募信贷市场而言。我要说的第二件事，Tracy，是违约只是开始。对客户来说真正重要的是损失，对吧？因为私募信贷文件的强度允许你坐下来与所有者谈判，也许可以获得更多股权。有时我们必须控制公司，我们可以利用 **黑石集团**的所有资源来改善那家公司，并实际为我们的客户带来强劲的结果。所以我认为这是我将关注的两点。是的，你会看到违约，但问题是随着时间的推移，投资者的损失经验是什么，我认为我们对此非常有信心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: It really is a public market phenomenon and it exists in the public markets because public credit documents are really weak, right? It they don't have the same covenant protections that you have in private credit. And so, you can have debt layered in front of you. You can have collateral stripped. That's what's happened in a lot of these situations in the public markets. Fortunately, in private credit, the documents are more protective. And so, I think you will see less of that aggressive behavior in the private credit markets certainly versus the public credit markets. The second thing I would say, Tracy, is um the default is just the beginning. What really matters to clients are losses, right? Because the strength of a private credit document allows you to get to a table and negotiate with the owner for maybe more equity. Sometimes we have to take control of the company and we can use all of the resources of **Blackstone** to improve that company and actually deliver a strong outcome for our clients. And so I think those are the two points I would focus on. Yes, you will see defaults but the question is over time what is the loss experience for investors and that's something I think we have a lot of conviction in.

</details>

**Tracy**: 好的。所以除了 **First Brands** 的爆雷事件之外，还有

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Okay. So the other thing besides the uh **first branch** and **first branch** and trial blowups was the

</details>

**Joe**: 你只是想一直说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: you just want to keep saying

</details>

**Tracy**: 我会再多说 10 次。嗯，是这种担忧，你知道，关于一些数据中心融资的质量，比如芯片是否会像人们想象的那么有价值，嗯，你知道，实际上我刚才查了一下，像 **Oracle** 的一些信用违约互换实际上基本上继续创下新高，**Coreweave** 是另一个很多人关注的公司，它实际上有所回落。所以也许我不知道人们放松了一点，但从资本提供者，也就是贷款人的角度来看，嗯，目前对 AI 或相关基础设施融资的兴趣如何？在这些小插曲和我们在 CDS 市场中看到的可能代表这类情况的一些代理指标之后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I just I'm going to say like 10 more times um was this anxiety about you know the quality of some of these data center finding like oh are the chips going to be as valuable as people think and um you know actually I was just looking up like um some of the credit default swaps on **Oracle** actually uh basically continuing to hit new highs **coreweave** which is another one that people were watching a lot that's actually come in a bit So maybe I don't know people are chilled out a little bit but from the um capital provider the the the lenders um what is the appetite right now for AI or related infrastructure financing in the wave of some of these hiccups and what we see in like the CDS market for what might be some proxies for this kind of stuff.

</details>

**Z**: 看，我认为风险的性质很重要，对吧？我不想一概而论，因为你提到了。抵押品的类型很重要。你的对手方对我们来说很重要。无论是为芯片融资，还是为数据中心融资，我们都不想承担残值风险，对吧？我不认为那是信用风险。所以，如果我能投资芯片，如果我能投资一个拥有投资级对手方风险的数据中心，并且我的债务将根据合同协议（无论是三净租赁还是其他）全额偿还，而且我不需要承担残值风险。我不在乎那个数据中心在第 25 年值多少钱。我不在乎那些芯片在第 7 年值多少钱。那是真正好的风险。我认为当你将其限制在我们正在做的范围内时，我认为这非常有吸引力。人们会承担下一层风险吗？他们可能会，但你需要获得股权回报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Look, I think the nature of the risk matters, right? I don't want to paint it with a broad brush cuz you hit it. The type of collateral matters. Who your counterparty matters for us. Whether we're financing chips, we're financing a data center, we don't want to take residual value risk, right? I don't view that as credit risk. So, if I can invest in chips, if I can invest in a data center that has investment grade counterparty risk and my debt will fully be repaid inside of that contractual agreement, whether it's triple net or whatever. Um, and I don't have to take residual value risk. I don't care what that data center is worth in year 25. I don't care what those chips are worth in year 7. That's really good risk. I think when you confine it to that which is what we are doing I think that's quite attractive. Will folks take that next layer of risk? They might, but you need to make equity returns.

</details>

**Joe**: 有没有像一些，你知道，那些不那么三净的，随便什么，他们会比较说，好的，2026 年 1 月和 2025 年 1 月，有没有任何担忧？因为我们知道对建设有巨大的需求，对吧？这是一个多年、数万亿美元的项目。从您的角度来看，目前用于建设的资本基础有多强劲？它有没有发生变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: any pullback like in some of the you know the less triple net whatever they like compare say okay January 2026 versus January 2025 any anxiety because we know that there is incredible demand for the buildout right it's this multi-year multi- trillion dollar thing from your perspective right now how uh strong is the capital base for that buildout has it changed at all

</details>

**Z**: 我认为当你拥有合同保护时，我强调的是需求是存在的。现在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: I think when you have the contractual protections And I'm highlighting I think the demand is there. Now

</details>

**Joe**: 自 2025 年以来有没有发生一些变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: there been some change since 2025.

</details>

**Z**: 我会告诉你，因为对资本的需求如此巨大，并且大于可用资本的供应。当你看到这种情况发生时，你会看到利差趋于扩大。这是一件健康的事情。这对市场来说是件好事。我认为那些没有我强调的保护措施的交易，它们在信贷市场中更难完成。你会看到它们在股权市场中获得融资。我认为这两件事都是健康的。我认为当我退一步看时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: I would tell you that because the demand for capital is so significant and bigger than the supply of available capital. When you see that happen, you see spreads tend to widen. That's a healthy thing. That's a good thing for the markets. And I think some of those deals that don't have the protections that I highlighted, they have a harder time getting done in the credit markets. And you see them get funded in the equity markets. I think both of those things are healthy. I think when I take a big step back,

</details>

**Z**: 关于这个市场有很多讨论，但我们坚信 AI 的影响。当然。我认为更大的风险是低估了它对你更广泛投资组合的影响，就像我之前提到的那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: there is a lot of chatter about this market, but we are firm believers in the impact of AI. Sure. And I think the bigger risk is underestimating the impact of it on your broader portfolio like I was alluding to before.

</details>

**Tracy**: 嗯，您第四季度过得怎么样？您从投资者那里收到了哪些问题？因为我们知道，像 **Blue Owl** 等其他一些私募信贷参与者收到了一批赎回。嗯，您看到了类似的压力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Um, what was the fourth quarter actually like for you and what sort of questions were you getting from investors? Because we know, you know, some other private credit players like **Blue Owl** got a bunch of redemptions. Um, did you see similar pressures?

</details>

**Z**: 看，每当你看到你强调的那些新闻时，收到问题是很自然的，我们欢迎这些问题，我们用我刚才强调的事实来回答它们。我认为对我们来说，我们继续看到对信贷的非常强劲的需求。我第四季度大概两次环游世界，与我们全球的客户会面，我会告诉你，总的来说，他们想要更多的私募信贷，对吧？我们的机构客户。我认为截至 9 月 30 日的年初至今流入量比去年同期增长了 50% 以上。我们去年年底与许多大客户举行了一次论坛，讨论信贷市场中的相对价值和风险。实际上，这对我来说很棒，因为这是一种我可以实际调查客户观点的方式。我会告诉你，他们继续对私募信贷非常看好。如果说有什么的话，他们觉得作为一种资产类别，私募信贷的配置不足。所以我认为这种势头将继续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Look, anytime you tend to see um some of the press that you highlighted, it's natural to get questions and we embrace those questions and we address them with the facts that I just highlighted. I think for us, we continue to see very strong demand for credit. I was around the world I think twice in the fourth quarter meeting with um our clients around the world and I would tell you in aggregate they want more private credit, right? our institutional clients. I think year-to-date through 9:30 inflows were up over 50% versus where they were a year prior. We held a forum with many of our big clients um late last year to discuss relative value and risks in the credit market. And actually, it was great for me because it was a way I could actually survey our clients on their views. And I would tell you they continue to be very bullish on private credit. If anything, they feel underallocated to private credit as an asset class. And so I think the momentum will continue.

</details>

**Joe**: 这有点触及我最喜欢谈论的事情之一，比如投资组合构建，但对于这些大型客户来说，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: This sort of touches on one of my favorite um things to talk about like sort of portfolio construction, but for these mega clients,

</details>

**Joe**: 如果他们说：“好的，我们配置不足，或者我们想要更多。”那么私募信贷的特点在他们广泛的投资组合配置中为他们解决了什么问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: if they say, "Okay, we're underallocated or we want more of this." What is it that in their broad portfolio allocation the characteristics of private credit are solving for them right now?

</details>

**Z**: 是的。嗯，你看，收益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Yeah. Well, look, yield.

</details>

**Tracy**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Okay.

</details>

**Z**: 每个人都喜欢收益，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Everyone loves yield, right?

</details>

**Z**: 每个人都喜欢收益。我认为即使利差收紧，利率略有下降，即便如此，信贷收益相对于标普 500 指数的盈利收益，在很长一段时间内都非常有吸引力。所以，信贷仍然具有吸引力。我认为当估值昂贵时，就像今天世界上大多数资产类别一样，在资本结构顶端采取防御性策略非常重要。多元化，对吧？我们的大多数客户在他们的投资组合中都有大量的信用风险，抱歉，是企业风险，无论是私募股权还是信贷方面。实物资产呢？这就是为什么资产支持融资，这就是为什么投资级对我们的客户如此具有说服力，如此高的信心，因为它提供了多元化。它提供了对实物硬资产的访问，这些资产相对于企业风险具有下行保护。然后，我想说，我们全球客户的另一个大主题是我们所说的多资产信贷。这个概念是，信贷作为一个整体是我希望部署资金的地方。然而，我也认识到市场有涨有跌。信贷内部的一个市场可能具有吸引力，而另一个市场可能吸引力较小。我如何与像 **黑石集团**这样的公司合作，在我们所做的一切中，在信贷内部的十几种不同资产类别中，建立一个多元化、有弹性、更高收益的投资组合，让我能够转向市场中最好的机会，无论它们在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Everybody loves yield. And I think even with spreads tighter and with rates coming off a little bit, even with that, the yield in credit relative to the earnings yield of the S&P is as attractive has been over a very long period of time. So, credit remains attractive. I think when valuations are expensive like they are across the world today in most asset classes, being defensive at the top of the capital structure really matters. Diversification, right? Most of our clients have a lot of credit risk, corporate credit risk, excuse me, corporate risk in their portfolios, whether it's private equity or on the credit side. What about real assets? That's why assetback finance, that's why investment grade have been so um convincing for you know so high conviction for our clients because it offers that diversification. It offers that access to real hard assets that are downside protected versus corporate risk. And then I would say the other big theme for our clients around the world is something we call multi-asset credit. It is this notion that credit as a whole is a place I want to be deployed into. However, I'm also recognizing the fact that markets eb and flow. Where one market within credit is attractive, one might be less attractive. How do I partner with someone like **Blackstone** across everything we do over a dozen different asset classes within credit to build a diversified, resilient, higher yielding portfolio that allows me to pivot to the best opportunities in the market wherever they may be?

**Joe**: 嗯，撇开 2025 年底的一些“蟑螂现象”不谈，还有另一件对信贷市场来说相当大的事情发生了，那就是银行杠杆贷款指导方针的撤销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: M um setting aside some of the uh cockroach phenomenon of late 2025, there was another thing that happened that was pretty big for the credit market and that was the withdrawal of the leverage lending guidelines for banks.

</details>

**Joe**: 嗯，基本上让他们更容易进行广泛的银团贷款。您认为这会增加银行与业务发展公司之间的竞争吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Uh basically making it easier for them to uh do broadly syndicated loans. Would you expect that to increase competition between the banks and the you know BDC's so to speak?

</details>

**Z**: 看，这件事受到了很多关注，我最近和银行的许多朋友谈过。我认为现实是，在新的直接贷款交易中，市场，我指的是私募股权发起人，他们已经很大程度上表达了意见，对吧？比如速度、确定性、灵活性、定制化，所有我强调的东西，对他们来说都是非常好的，尤其是在他们收购公司并参与竞争性拍卖过程时。即使是过去两年中符合杠杆贷款指导方针的交易，其中 85% 也是通过私募方式融资的，对吧？所以即使有合规的交易，借款人仍然选择私募信贷。我会说，今天我们与银行的合作机会，特别是在我们业务的投资级方面，它比我所说的过去几年中看到的任何情况都要大。银行渴望与我们合作，他们保留客户关系，他们保留服务，我们保留资产。我们正在将这视为一种全球动态，特别是在一些长期资产类别，这些硬资产类别周围，而这些正是我们的投资者想要的东西，所以我认为这种合作机会将继续增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Look, that one's gotten a lot of attention and I've spoken to a lot of my friends at the banks recently. I think the reality is on new direct lending deals, the market, and by the market, I mean the private equity sponsors, they've largely spoken, right? Like speed, certainty, flexibility, customization, all the stuff I hit on, that's a really good thing for them, especially when they're buying a company and they're in a competitive auction process. Even deals that met the leverage loan lending guidelines that were in place over the last two years, 85% of them were financed privately, right? So even when you had complying deals, they were borrowers were still choosing private credit. I'd say today our partnership opportunities with the banks, particularly on the investment grade side of what we do, it is more uh it is bigger than anything I would say that we've seen over the last several years. The bank's desire to partner with us where they keep the client arrangement, they keep the servicing, we keep the asset. We are seeing that as a global dynamic especially around some of these longer duration asset classes, these hard asset asset classes and those are the exact things that our our investors want and so I think that partnership opportunity um will continue to grow.

**Tracy**: 这是我们之前谈过的“亦敌亦友”动态，对吧？所以私募贷款人与公募贷款人、银行竞争，但与此同时，我们看到更多的合作。不，这其中有很多直觉，你知道，想要保持这种关系，但也有这种元素，比如，好的，速度和定制化，融资。我有一个关于管理的问题，内部管理和发展业务的艺术。您提到了要积极主动。所以，您会有人打电话，他们会说，我们做了这件事。您对这个解决方案感兴趣吗？等等。您有这家大公司。您正在随着时间的推移建设它。我很好奇，您如何设计一个系统，让很多人都在打电话，但又希望他们发展自己的业务，同时又不降低标准，不让垃圾进入，您认为如何将这些系统构建进去，以便打电话的人不会，你知道，只是为了增加销量而带来一堆垃圾？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: This is the friendmy dynamic that we've spoken about before right so private lenders are in competition with the public lenders the banks but at the same time we're seeing more partnerships. No, and there's a lot of intu intuitive there about, you know, wanting to keep that relationship, but also this element of like, okay, the speed and customization, the financing. I have a question actually about management, internal management and the art of growing a business. You mentioned being proactive. So, you're going to have people on the phone and they're like, we did this thing. Would you be interested in this solution? And so forth. You have this big company. You're building it over time. I'm curious like how do you design a system such that you have lots of people working the phones but um wanting to grow their own books but not lower standards and let garbage into it and how do you think like how do you build those systems into it so that the person on the phone isn't you know yeah bringing in a bunch of garbage just to grow volume

</details>

**Z**: 我喜欢这个问题。所以，当我回顾我们 **黑石信贷**业务的历史时，显然我们看到了巨大的增长，我们看到了巨大的成功。嗯，对我个人来说，一个重要的转折点是疫情，因为在那之前，我们几乎将每个业务都作为垂直部门来运营，对吧？无论是直接贷款、资产支持融资还是流动性信贷，我们在每个业务中都有项目经理，他们从筹集资本到投资资本再到管理团队，几乎都作为一个垂直实体来运营各自的业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: I love this question so um as I think back at the history of our business at blastoning credit obviously we've seen tremendous growth we've seen tremendous success. Um, a big turning point for me personally was co because up until that point in time, we ran each of our businesses almost as verticals, right? We whether it was direct lending or asset back finance or liquid credit, we had PMs in each of those businesses and they ran each of their businesses from raising the capital to investing the capital to manage the team almost as a vertical entity.

</details>

**Z**: 我们没有横向层级。但疫情教会我们，当我们都穿着睡衣在家，市场变得混乱时，我们需要这种连接性。如果我们的业务的一个部分与另一个部分真正连接起来，那将非常有价值。因此，我们开始建立我们的首席投资官办公室，由我领导，作为一个横向层级，连接所有点，并在我们的团队中带来巨大的连贯性。五年后，那个团队现在有 120 多人。那个团队日复一日地做的事情是统一我们每个投资业务的结构。所以我们有一个单一的投资委员会，无论你是直接贷款交易、资产支持交易还是流动性交易，你都去同一个投资委员会，相同的承销标准，相同的备忘录，但最重要的是，相同的人听取来自 **黑石信贷**生态系统所有不同部分的交易，以了解哪里有最好的机会。顺便说一句，那个投资委员会还包括 **黑石集团**信贷之外的高级代表。我们在私募股权中学习到了什么？我们在基础设施中学习到了什么可能影响这个决定？我们汇总和监控数据的方式，我们现在有一个集中的投资组合公司报告系统。所以，每当我们在一个领域看到弱点时，整个团队都会立即知道，并说：“好的，让我们在这个行业减少发起，让我们在另一个行业加大发起。”所以，系统化我们的数据，集中化我们的流程，更广泛地融入我们在 **黑石集团**看到的主题，这已成为我们旅程的关键部分，我认为也是我们未来巨大的竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: We had no horizontal layer. But what co taught us when we were all at home in our pajamas and the markets were going wonky that we needed that connectivity. It would be really valuable if one piece of our business was really connected with the other piece of our business. And so we started building out our CIO office which I lead as a horizontal layer to connect all of the dots and bring tremendous consistency across our teams. And 5 years on that team is now 120 plus people. And what that team does day in day out is unifying the fabric of every single one of our investment businesses. And so we have a single investment committee that whether you are a direct lending deal or an asset back deal or a liquid deal, you go to that same investment committee, same underwriting standards, same memo, but most importantly the same people hearing the deals from all the different parts of the **Blackstone** credit ecosystem to know where are the best opportunities. By the way, that investment committee also includes senior representatives of **Blackstone** outside of credit. What are we learning in private equity? What are we learning in infrastructure that might influence this decision? The way we aggregate and monitor data, we now have one centralized portfolio company reporting system. And so anytime we see weaknesses in an area, instantly the entire team knows that and say, "Okay, let's pull back origination in this sector and let's lean into origination in this other sector." And so systemizing our data, centralizing our processes, being even more plugged into the themes we see more broadly at **Blackstone**, that has been a critical part of our journey and I think a huge competitive advantage for us going forward.

### 保险资本与私募信贷的共生

**Tracy**: 我想回到我们对话的起点，我是说，真正的起点，您的职位名称。所以 **黑石信贷**和保险的首席投资官。我认为这非常重要，并且在很多方面被低估了，但保险公司和私募信贷之间的合作一直非常出色。我们看到的大部分私募信贷增长都直接来自保险公司。如果您在私募信贷领域，或者能够接触到那个资本池，那么成为一家保险公司有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I just want to go back to where we started the conversation and I mean really the beginning of the conversation, your job title. So CIO for **Blackstone Credit** and insurance. I think this is really important and underappreciated in many ways, but the partnership between insurers and private credit has been phenomenal. Like a lot of the private credit growth that we are seeing is coming directly from insurers. How important is it to I guess be an insurance company if you're in the private credit space or have access to that pool of capital?

</details>

**Z**: 当然。嗯，有几点我想在这里强调。嗯，第一是我们在保险领域的商业模式，因为它与其他一些模式不同，对吧？我们没有专属的保险资产负债表。我们不直接在 **黑石集团**发起保险负债。我们所做的只是代表保险客户充当第三方资产管理人。那是我们最擅长的。我们只想做这个。我们一点一滴地建立了我们的客户基础。这是一个完全开放的架构模型。我们所有的客户都并肩而坐。嗯，所以我认为这种商业模式至关重要，对吧？我们不想与我们的客户竞争。嗯，我们希望确保他们每个人都能在我们这里获得良好的体验。我认为这是一个商业模式问题。我认为这是我们如何建立这个特许经营权的重要组成部分。第二部分是原因。为什么保险公司寻求私募信贷资本？嗯，就寿险公司而言，你正在承保一份 40 年的寿险保单。就承保年金而言，你正在承保一份固定的合同。嗯，管理资产以应对这些负债的最佳方式是安全、支付现金的合同资产。这些资产正是我们在私募信贷中发起的。而我们在这场讨论中一直谈论的额外利差，同等信用评级的投资级信贷的 150 到 200 个基点，对于保险公司来说，相对于仅仅在屏幕上购买传统流动性资产，这是极其宝贵的。我们已经看到美国保险公司大规模采用这种方式并取得了巨大成功。我认为未来的一大主题是同样的理念扩展到欧洲、扩展到亚洲，因为它非常适合保险公司的资产负债表，高质量、安全、合同化、长期限的投资级资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Sure. Well, couple points I want to really hit here. Um, one is our business model in insurance because it is different than some others, right? We don't have a captive insurance balance sheet. We don't originate insurance liabilities directly at **Blackstone**. All we do is act as a third-party asset manager on behalf of insurance clients. That's what we do best. That's all we want to do. Brick by brick. We've built our client base. It's a fully open architecture model. All of our clients sit shoulder-to-shoulder. Um, and so I think that business model is critical, right? We don't want to compete with our clients. Um, and we want to make sure that every single one of them gets a great experience with us. I think that's a business model question. And I think that's an important part of how we set up that franchise. The second piece is the why. Why are insurance companies seeking private credit capital? Well, in the case of a lifeur, you're writing a 40-year life insurance policy. In case of writing an annuity, you're writing a a set uh contract. Um the best way to manage assets against those liabilities are safe cash paying contractual assets. Those assets are exactly what we originate in private credit. And that excess spread that we've been talking about throughout this discussion, 150 to 200 basis points for investment grade like for like credit, that is extraordinarily valuable for insurance companies versus just buying traditional liquids on the screen. And we've seen US insurance companies adopt that in scale with a ton of success. And one of the big themes I see going forward is that same idea expanding to Europe, expanding to Asia because it is such a strong fit for insurance company balance sheets, highquality, safe, contractual, longduration investment grade assets.

</details>

**Joe**: 所以我从未在保险或私募信贷领域工作过，但我曾在媒体行业和数字媒体行业工作。你看到的一种现象是，公司刚开始时，他们会购买各种现成的第三方解决方案，比如“哦，我要购买一款软件来运行我的网站内容管理系统”。然后你发展壮大，然后你继续发展壮大，然后你会说，“你知道吗，这个第三方解决方案不行，我需要构建自己的软件来管理我的内容等等。”那么会发生什么呢？保险公司是否会达到一个点，他们会说，“你知道吗，我们很高兴与你们合作，但我们实际上想推出自己的私募信贷部门”，我们知道当然有一些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: So I've never worked in insurance or private credit, but I've worked in the media industry and the digital media industry. And one of the phenomenons that you see is company starts and they buy various thirdparty solutions off the shelf like oh I'm going to like buy a piece of software to run my uh content management system for the website. Then you grow and then you grow and you're like you know what this uh third party solution doesn't work I need to build my own software for managing my content etc. Does what happens like do insurance companies hit a point where it's like you know what

</details>

**Tracy**: 我的意思是，有一些保险公司是完全合并的。他们会这样做吗？有没有一个点，让他们拥有自己的私募信贷部门是有意义的，还是说这取决于具体情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: we we we've enjoyed doing business with you but we actually want to launch our own private credit arm and we know that there are some of course I mean there are insurers who are joined at the do all do they what is there a point where it just makes sense for them to like have their own private credit shop or is it sort of case by case whether that makes sense for them?

</details>

**Z**: 嗯，我认为总体的趋势是相反的，对吧？我们的业务之所以增长如此之快，是因为保险公司说：“嘿，**黑石集团**，你们在这方面真的很擅长。你们有一个庞大的专业团队。你们拥有大量的专业知识。我们无法复制。”但这因公司而异，有些公司继续内部做一些事情。有些公司有特定的策略，他们拥有这方面的专业知识，他们会继续内部做，我们很乐意在我们可以增加价值的领域进行补充。但我想说，总体的趋势是认识到我们已经建立了这个基础设施，这个发起团队，这个首席投资官投资组合管理特许经营权，这个资产配置框架，客户希望从中受益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Well, I think the direction of travel broadly is the other way, right? The reason why our business has grown so much is because insurance companies have said, "Hey, **Blackstone**one, you're really good at this. You've got a huge dedicated team. You've got tons of expertise. We can't replicate it." But that is company by company and some continue to do some things in house. Some have certain strategies where they have that expertise and they'll continue to do that in house and we're happy to complement in the areas where we can be editive. But I would say the overall direction of travel is a realization that we have built out this infrastructure, this origination team, this CIO portfolio man management franchise, this allocate asset allocation framework and clients want to benefit from that.

### 私募信贷的未来挑战与思考

**Joe**: 嗯，您在整个对话中都提到了额外利差，我理解一切都是相对的观点。我想我在开场白中也提到了这一点，但直接贷款的利差在过去一年中确实下降了。所以，我认为我们三年来首次跌破 10% 左右。以前它们在中低十位数。您认为明年或今年利差会发生什么变化？我应该这么说，因为如果供应增加，但利差却越来越紧，这对我来说似乎有点令人担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Uh you've mentioned excess spreads throughout this conversation and I take the point that everything is relative. I think I mentioned that in the intro, but it is also true that spreads on direct lending have fallen over the past year. So, I think we went below 10% for like the first time in 3 years, something like that. They used to be in the mid to low teens. What do you see happening to spreads next year or this year, I should say, because it seems kind of concerning to me if we're getting more supply, but spreads are grinding tighter.

</details>

**Z**: 是的。嗯，你看，我认为有几件事。首先，你提到了，对吧？借款人确实有选择权，对吧？所以与流动性市场的情况会有一些联系，随着时间的推移，私募与流动性市场之间的 200 个基点利差一直保持不变，今天也保持不变。所以我认为这是一件值得关注的事情，我认为你提出的相对价值点是关键点。我认为第二件事是，嗯，是的，你开始看到更多的并购供应，但我们仍然远低于五年前的水平。所以我认为还有很大的发展空间。当我退一步，看看私募股权干火药与私募信贷干火药的简单数学时，私募股权干火药是私募信贷的五倍。好的。所以我认为在供应方面还有很大的发展空间。我认为今天的利差相当稳定。我认为我们的客户赚取了相对于流动性市场的额外利差，赚取了绝对回报，即使它不像三年前那样，但相对于今天股票的估值和他们投资组合中的其他东西，仍然感觉相当不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Yeah. Well, look, I think there's a couple of things there. First, you mentioned it, right? Um, borrowers do have choice, right? And so there is going to be some connection to where the liquid markets are and over time that 200 basis point spread for privates versus liquids has held and it holds today. And so I think that's one thing to watch and I think that relative value point you made is the crit critical point. I think the second thing is um yes you are starting to see more M&A supply but we're still well off where we were 5 years ago. And so I think there's still a lot more room to run. And when I kind of step back and I look at the simple math of private equity dry powder versus private credit dry powder, private equity dry powder outstrips it five to one. Okay. And so I think there's still a lot more room to run in the supply equation. I think spreads today are pretty stable. And I think our clients earning that excess spread versus liquids, earning that absolute return, which still feels quite good even though it's not the same as it was 3 years ago still feels quite good relative to where equities are valued today and other things in their portfolio.

</details>

**Joe**: 在一般私人资产中，一个流行的批评是，你知道，人们称之为“波动性洗白”。就像，“哦，看，我的股票投资组合和我的其他投资组合在一个糟糕的季度表现不佳，但我的信贷投资组合这个季度持平”，因为没有交易，没有标记，这让我晚上睡得更安稳。而这种指责是，这个行业在某种程度上建立在这样一个概念上：这是一种能让我晚上睡得更好的资产类别，它不会波动等等。您对私人资产中“波动性洗白”的说法有什么回应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: In private assets in general, one of the popular critiques is that, you know, people call volatility laundering. It's like, oh, look, I had a rough quarter in my in my stock portfolio and my whatever, but my credit portfolio is flat this quarter and because there were no trades, there were no marks and that makes me feel sleep easier at night. And the the accusation is is an industry built to some extent on this notion of like here's this asset class that just like helps me sleep better at night, it doesn't doesn't move, etc. What do you what's the response to the volatility laundering claim in in private assets generally?

</details>

**Z**: 是的，有几点。首先，我查看了 20 年的损失率，对吧？你无法在 20 年内隐藏这一点。我认为这些数据不言自明。其次，你是对的。像，关于估值的这个问题在私人资产中一直存在。我的意思是，**黑石集团**已经存在 40 年了。我们使用一流的流程，与第三方估值提供商合作。我们每个季度都会标记我们的账簿。嗯，而且这些第三方是做这件事的人。我们将其按市值计价。公司基本面、市场变动，所有这些都会显现出来。对我来说有趣的是，你知道，当我们确实看到一项资产表现不佳并将其标记下调时（我们在我们的观察名单资产上就是这样做的），我们会收到关于它的问题。人们正在关注这一点。然而，他们也同时问我们，你们真的在标记你们的资产吗？所以，我认为如果你真的看看我们的投资组合，你会看到一小部分账簿没有达到我们预期的表现，我们也会相应地标记它们。我认为这是健康的。我认为这是好的。我认为这为我们的客户提供了一些缓冲，我们将继续使用我们成熟的第三方流程来继续这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Yeah, a couple things there. First, I looked to a 20-year loss ratio, right? Like, you can't hide that over 20 years. And I think those stats speak for themselves. Second, you're right. Like, this question around valuations have have been out there in private assets. I mean, Blast's been around for 40 years. We use a best-in-class process with third party valuation providers. We mark our book every single quarter. Um, and and those third parties are the ones that are doing it. And we mark that to market. company fundamentals, market moves, that all shows up. What's funny to me is, you know, when we do see underperformance in an asset and we mark it down, which we do on our watch list assets, we get questions about that. People are paying attention to that. Yet, they are also asking us out of the same breath, are you actually marking your assets? And so, I think if you actually look at our portfolio, you will see a small subset of the book that isn't doing what we expected to do, and we mark those accordingly. I think that's healthy. I think that's good. I think that provides some buffer for our clients and we'll continue to use our third party wellestablished process to continue to do so.

</details>

**Joe**: 嗯，您之前提到了干火药，这是市场的一个真理，那就是干火药似乎总是在等待时机，无论我们处于信贷周期的哪个阶段，总有人在谈论干火药。我有点惊讶听到您在私募信贷领域引用的那个数字，因为我们确实看到了惊人的增长，而且仍然有现金闲置需要部署。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Uh you mentioned dry powder earlier and this is a truism of markets which is dry powder always seems to be waiting in the wings like no matter where we are in the credit cycle someone's talking about dry powder. I'm sort of surprised to hear that much the number you cited in the private credit space because again like we have seen phenomenal growth and there's still cash lying around that needs to be deployed.

</details>

**Z**: 看，我们继续看到强劲的资金流入市场，对吧？产品正在做它应该做的事情，那就是为客户带来相对于流动性资产的强劲、持续的超额表现。我认为只要你看到这种情况继续下去，你就会继续看到所有客户类型（无论是保险、机构还是个人）的强劲资金流入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Look, we continue to see strong flows into the market, right? The product is doing what it's supposed to do which is generate strong consistent outperformance for clients relative to liquids. I think as long as you see that continue, you're going to continue to see strong flows across all of our client types, whether it's insurance, institutions, individuals.

### AI对金融工作流与人才需求的影响

**Joe**: 嗯，我今天在 2026 年 1 月经常问很多人一个问题，在您的组织内部。您是否找到了生成式 AI 工具的生产性应用，让您的生活更轻松，并减少，嗯，释放人们的工作时间去做其他事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: uh question I ask a lot of people today in January 2026 within your organization. Are you finding productive applications of generative AI tools that make your life easier and reduce uh free up working hours from people who to do other things?

</details>

**Z**: 是的，你看，这是我们关注的重点，我认为如果我说我们今天拥有“金票”那是在撒谎，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Yeah, look, this is a huge focus for us and I think I would be lying if I say we have the golden ticket today,

</details>

**Z**: 但我们非常关注这个领域。我们如何让我们的业务更高效？我们如何让我们的团队更轻松？无论是构建模型，了解在尽职调查过程中要问什么问题，数据聚合和分析，所有这些都在进行中。它处于不同的发展阶段。嗯，我认为你会继续看到我们大力投入。它永远无法取代投资决策，对吧？那仍然是我们流程的核心。但我认为，只要我们能利用 AI 提高效率，就像我说的，我们有工具可以做到这一点，比如创建投资委员会备忘录的初稿，模型的初稿，聚合数据，这样我们就能帮助我们的团队更早地发现趋势。所有这些都在进行中，我认为你会看到越来越多的采用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: but we have a lot of focus on this area. How do we make our business more efficient? How do we make it easier on our teams? Whether it's building models, knowing what questions to ask in their due diligence process, data aggregation and analysis, all of this stuff is in motion. It's at various stages of development. Um, and I think you will continue to see us lean into that significantly. It can never replace the investment decision, right? That's still going to be central to our process. But I think anytime we can use AI to drive efficiency, and I like I said, we have tools that allow that to like create the start of an investment committee memo, the start of a model, aggregate data so we can help our team see trends earlier. All of these things are in process and I think more and more you'll see higher adoption.

</details>

**Tracy**: 您能想象未来估值更多地由 AI 完成吗？因为我想到第三方估值服务。他们正在进行矩阵定价，这基本上是从他们能得到的其他线索中推断市场价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Could you imagine a future where valuation is done more by AI? Because I think about the third party valuation services. They're doing matrix pricing which is basically inferring the market value from you know other clues they can get.

</details>

**Joe**: 推断，你知道，那基本上就是 AI。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Inference is like you know that's AI basically.

</details>

**Z**: 看，我认为使用 AI 来支持这个过程，你知道，市场利差在哪里变动了？好的，这家公司的表现是 X。这如何转化为一个标记？我认为你会看到，就像我强调的投资过程一样。我认为你会看到支持工具的采用，提高效率，提高准确性，提高规模。归根结底，你仍然需要一个人来做出决定。嗯，但我确实认为你会看到它越来越多地融入我们的工作流程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Z**: Look, I I think using AI to support that process, you know, where have market spreads moved? Okay, this company's performance was X. How does that translate into a mark? I think you will see just like I I highlighted on the investment process. I think you will see adoption of support tools driving efficiency, driving accuracy, driving scale. At the end of the day, you still need a human at the end of that to make the decision. Um, but I do think you'll see it incorporated more and more into our workflows.

### 私募信贷的未来挑战与思考

**Tracy**: Joe，我是一名记者或播客主持人。也许有区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Joe, I'm a journalist or a podcast host. Maybe there's a difference.

</details>

**Joe**: 不，不，不。没有，我们是记者。人们在派对上问我，你做什么的？我说我是记者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: No, no, no. There's no no we're journalists. People ask me at parties, what do you do? I say I'm a journalist.

</details>

**Tracy**: 好的。好的。嗯，记者的天性是，嗯，比投资者更悲观一点。我的意思是，如果你是投资者，几乎从定义上来说，你必须是乐观的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: All right. All right. Uh the natural tendencies of journalists is to uh be a little bit more pessimistic than an investor. I mean, if you're an investor, almost by definition, you have to be optimistic.

</details>

**Joe**: 我同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I agree.

</details>

**Tracy**: 一个偏执的乐观主义者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: A paranoid optimist.

</details>

**Joe**: 对。但我确实在私募信贷市场看到了一些担忧迹象。所以，除了我们谈论的蟑螂之外，你知道，我们有更多的公司进行责任管理。我发现文件这一点有点令人惊讶，因为在我们之前的对话中，当然在我看到的一些研究中，人们说文件正在下降。所以投资者保护基本上正在下降，并且与公募市场有更多的趋同等等。所以，我理解这一点，就像我们节目中的每个私募信贷投资者都会说他们与众不同，他们更具选择性等等。这可能是真的，但总的来说，如果你看到文件下降，杠杆上升，供应增加，那看起来有点糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: That's right. But I do see some signs of worry in the private credit market. So, beyond the cockroaches um that we talked about, you know, we have more companies doing liability managements. The documentation point I found kind of surprising because in our previous conversations and certainly in some of the research that I see people say that documentation is declining. So investor protections are basically going down and there's more convergence with the public market and things like that. So, I I take the point that like every private credit investor that we have on this show is going to say that they're different and they're more selective and things like that. And it may be true, but overall, if you're seeing documentation go down and leverage go up and supply increasing, that seems kind of bad.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。不，我的意思是，你看，我认为我猜，我的意思是，所有这些在我看来在这些紧张关系中都非常直观。另一件事，它与此有点相关，那就是你如何维持，好的，你考虑基本服务，对吧？你考虑像速度和定制化等基本服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. No, I mean, look, I think the thing that I I guess I mean, all of that sounds very intuitive to me in these tensions. The other thing that and it's sort of related to this is like how do you maintain like okay you think about the fundamental service right you think about the fundamental service of like speed and custom customizability and so forth

</details>

**Tracy**: 然后存在的紧张关系是，好的，你想要立即解决这个问题等等，以及这与健全的文件之间的紧张关系。我的意思是，20 年的记录在某种程度上不言自明。但另一方面，你可以看到这些事情随着时间的推移会如何，嗯，尤其是在如此竞争激烈的环境中产生紧张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: and then the tension that exists is like okay you want to like turn this around right away etc and the tension between that and like robust documentations and I mean again 20-year to some extent speaks for itself. But on the other hand, like you could see how these things over time would come into um especially come into tension such a competitive environment.

</details>

**Joe**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Exactly.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我想，你知道吗，你给我打电话是因为你需要钱。我想能够立即给你一个答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I want to you know what you you place a phone call to me because you need money. I want to be able to give you an answer right away.

</details>

**Joe**: 我会很快说“是”。我想能够对你说“是”，以维持你的业务，维持这条线，以及作为贷款人与借款人之间的关系，与，你知道，我与我的那些想要保护的人之间的关系，等等，之间可能出现的紧张关系。你肯定能看到那些会如何出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I'm going to say yes very quickly. I want to be able to say yes to you to maintain your business, to maintain that line and the tensions that could potentially emerge between like our relationship as the lender to the borrower versus, you know, my relationship to my uh people who want protections, etc. You could see how those uh would emerge for sure.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。好的。我们就在这里结束吧？
