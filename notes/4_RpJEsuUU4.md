title: 奥的斯CEO Judy Marks访谈：电梯行业的创新、文化与领导力
---

### 奥的斯：连接世界的百年品牌

大家好，我是挪威**主权财富基金**（Sovereign Wealth Fund: 国家拥有的投资基金）的首席执行官Nicolai Tangen。今天，我很荣幸能与奥的斯（**Otis**：全球领先的电梯和自动扶梯制造商及服务提供商）的首席执行官兼总裁Judy Marks女士在一起。奥的斯是一家令人惊叹的公司，作为电梯和升降机制造商，他们每天在全球200个国家运送24亿人次。我认为Judy的领导力是创新和“以人为本”文化的杰出典范。非常欢迎您。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody. I'm Nicolola Tangan, the CEO of Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund. And today I'm in really good company with Judy Marx, who is the CEO and president of Otis. Now Otis is an incredible company. It's a lifts and elevator company, and they move 2.4 billion people every day across 200 countries. Now, uh I think Judy's leadership is just like a standout example of innovation and people first culture. And so big welcome. Thanks Nikolai. Great to be great to be here in Oslo with you.</p>
</details>

Judy，当我们一起乘坐电梯，您按下五楼时，您如何判断这是一部好的电梯？首先，随着技术的发展，您可能在进入电梯轿厢之前就已经按下了楼层。但对我来说，好的电梯关乎乘坐质量、安全以及整体的乘客体验。我认为乘客体验将是未来许多变化之一。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So the first thing is so now um Judy we we go into an elevator right you and I uh together and um you press you know fifth floor. Just how how do you know that you're in a good elevator? Well the first thing is actually as technology develops hopefully you're going to press that floor before you ever get to the get to the unit and the car itself. But to me it's about ride quality. It's about safety. Uh, and it's about um just the general passenger experience. And I think that passenger experience is going to be one of the many things that changes in the near future.</p>
</details>

什么是乘坐质量？它是一种感觉。您会感觉到什么？我认为每个人都有不同的反应：它是否平稳？它是否会影响我的耳朵？这是一种非常个人化的体验。它应该快速加速吗？它应该平稳启动吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is a ride ride quality? What is that? Uh, it's something you feel. Yeah. You feel how do you feel? How do you What do you feel? Oh, I think I think every person has a reaction. Is it smooth? Is it uh is does it bother my does it bother my ears? Um, how does it It's just a It's a It's a very personal experience. Should it like accelerate a lot? Should it uh be I mean just what should it like start with a bang? Should it start smoothly? What what should it do?</p>
</details>

作为一名工程师，我们的目标是尽可能快地实现加速，以便安全、迅速地运送更多人。客户希望以最小的空间，最高效、最快速地运送最多的人，因为如果电梯井道不用于电梯，他们就可以出租或出售那部分空间，无论是公寓楼还是零售空间。因此，目标是加速并且不在每一层都停。这是一个生理和速度之间的平衡。我们之所以在乘客进入电梯前就让他们选择楼层，然后告知他们乘坐哪部电梯，是为了减少停靠次数，更快加速，更快运送乘客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know the goal and and Noli, you know, I'm an engineer. So, so the goal is the faster you can get to acceleration, the more people you can move safely and move quickly. And when I talk to customers, what they want is to use the least amount of space to move the most amount of people as efficiently and quickly as they can. because if they're not using it for a hoist for an elevator, they can rent it. They can sell that space, you know, whether it's an apartment building or retail. So, the goal is to accelerate and not stop at every floor. Um, so so but but it's a balance in terms of physiology and it's a balance in terms of how fast you can you can actually move the people. But the reason we group people in in a in a product where you you push the floor before you ever get into the elevator and then it tells you which one to go. The reason we group them is to be able to have less stops and to accelerate more quickly and to move people more quickly.</p>
</details>

电梯里应该有音乐吗？我认为应该有。多年前，我们是第一家在电梯里安装音乐的公司。您最喜欢哪种电梯音乐？我们相信现在的电梯可以提供音乐选择。但最初电梯里安装音乐的原因是，在电梯实现**自主运行**（Autonomous: 无需人工操作即可自行运行）之前，曾有电梯服务员。音乐是为了安抚那些习惯有人在电梯里的人的恐惧，让他们感到更舒适，听着舒缓的音乐，这就是电梯音乐的由来。

<p class="english-text">Should there be music in an elevator? I think there there should be and uh we were the first elevator that put music in uh many many years ago. What's your favorite what's your favorite elevator music? Uh I Well, it's interesting. We actually believe elevators now can offer you to choose your music. All right. So, I think it's up to anybody. But the original reason that music was put in elevators was when there used to be elevator attendance before they were autonomous. And so, this was to to settle people's fears who were used to having someone in there. So, they felt more comfortable. They they listened to calming music and that's where elevator music came from.</p>
</details>

哦，这很有趣。

### 标志性建筑与全球足迹

您在全球许多标志性建筑中都有业务。您最引以为傲的是什么？我不得不提及我们从建成之日起就参与的一些建筑。我们是唯一一家从第一天起就入驻埃菲尔铁塔的美国或非法国公司。我们仍在进行现代化改造和维护，为埃菲尔铁塔提供全面服务，它确实是标志性的。帝国大厦也是如此。那座大楼在13个月内建成，当时是世界上最高的建筑，在技术上对我们提出了巨大挑战。我们仍在为Tony Malcin和帝国大厦提供服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you are you are in a lot of iconic buildings around the world. Uh, what are you what are you most proud of? Well, I I'd have to go back to some of the buildings we've been in since day since the day they were built. Uh, we were the only US or non-French company to be in the Eiffel Tower from day one. We're still modernizing and maintaining. We have full service on the Eiffel Tower and it's truly iconic. Same with the Empire State Building. Uh, you know, as that building went up in 13 months, it was the highest building in the world at the time and it really stretched us technologically. We still are working for for Tony Malcin uh and the Empire State Building.</p>
</details>

帝国大厦在13个月内建成。您认为今天需要多长时间？会更长。为什么？因为法规。当时没有那么多法规。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He went up in 13 months. The whole Empire State Building was How long How long time do you think they would have it would have taken them today? A lot longer. And why why regulations were were not okay. So lots of people no regulations. Yeah,</p>
</details>

上个月我经仁川机场转机到新航站楼，那里有我们最大的自动人行道，长达130多米。我们生产自动人行道、自动扶梯，也服务于标志性建筑，比如我们有世界最高的建筑哈利法塔。当然，随着建筑不断增高，这个纪录会随时间改变。但对您来说，重要的只是您使用的那栋建筑。我可以谈论标志性建筑，但真正重要的是您居住和使用的电梯，只要它可靠并能把您送到目的地，您甚至不会想到电梯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, I think about um as recent as uh last month, I was transiting through Inchan through through through the Inchan terminal to the new terminal, and we've got our largest moving walkway there. It's over 130 m long, one one unit. So, uh you know, we do moving walkways, we do escalators, but but iconic buildings, we have the Burge, we have the tallest building in the world. Now, that that'll change over time as as buildings continue to rise, but um you know, it it only matters to you for the building you use. So, I can talk iconic, but it kind of only matters where you live and what you use. And as long as that's reliable and gets you where you need to be, you don't even think about the elevator.</p>
</details>

法规是一个有趣的话题。圣母院在五年内重建完成，因为他们被告知不需要遵守法规。所以，这可能会带来巨大的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, regulations is an interesting thing, right? So, they managed to rebuild Notradam in 5 years because they were told they didn't need to to care about regulations. So um it can have have a big big difference moving um looking at the the total market.</p>
</details>

### 行业整合与盈利能力

我认为最令人着迷的事情之一是电梯公司数量如此之少。是的，这个行业非常**整合**（Consolidated: 指市场由少数几家大型公司主导）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the fascinating things I think is just how few elevator companies there are. Yeah, it's very very consolidated. Very consolidated.</p>
</details>

对。比如奥的斯、蒂森克虏伯（Tiss Con）。出于对我竞争对手的尊重，还有迅达（Schindler），以及四家日本竞争对手和几家中国竞争对手。为什么这个行业如此整合？我认为原因有很多。我认为最重要的一点是我们工作的性质：生命安全，高风险业务，包括安装工作，我们必须在高空作业。但更重要的是，我们每天运送大量人员，而且我们无法训练或控制每一位乘客，无论是吵闹的足球迷在自动扶梯上跳上跳下，还是一群大学兄弟会成员想看看电梯能挤多少人。我们无法控制这些，但每个人每次乘坐都必须安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So you got like uh you got Otis, Tiss Con. Well I I out of respect for my competitors Schindler and then there's four Japanese competitors and a few Chinese competitors. Yeah. So why is this all consolidated? Uh I think it's a variety of reasons. I think the the single most important is the nature of the work we do life safety uh high-risk high uh business uh in terms of both installations I mean we work at heights um but I think more importantly the fact that um we move people every day uh and you think about just uh you know and you've heard me say this before I we can't train or control a single passenger whether it's a rowdy group of football fans jumping up and down on an escalator or uh or a group of of of college fraternity uh brothers who who want to see how many people they can fit in an elevator. Um you know we we don't control that and yet everyone has to have a safe ride every time.</p>
</details>

为什么你们能赚这么多钱？为什么这个行业如此有利可图？这个行业之所以有利可图，是因为服务业务。我们的产品是固定不动的，它可能上下移动，可能对角移动，也可能是自动人行道，但它会永远留在原地，这意味着您需要服务，而服务是受法规管制的。法规要求客户必须进行定期维护。对我们来说，这是一种订阅服务，每年一次。我们有很多客户会签订多年合同，但客户必须进行维护，以便当地政府和当局检查他们的设备并继续使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you make so much money? Why is this business so profitable? Well, the business is profitable. Um and it's because of the service business. So what happens is and and we do we do focus on this as a as a a service-driven business model on a flywheel. Uh the beauty of our business is our product stays in place. It may move up and down. It may move diagonally. It may move uh a moving walkway, but it stays forever, which means you have the service which is regulated. The regulation Nikolai is on the customer. So when you think about the fact that someone something has to have scheduled maintenance for us, it's a subscription service. It's annual. Uh we have many that go multiple years, but customers have to have that if they're going to get their unit inspected by the local government, local authorities, uh and continue to use it.</p>
</details>

如果检查不合格，他们就会关闭电梯，或者要求维修。所以，维修也是我们服务业务的一部分。这是一种“故障修复”式的业务。这些机电设备正变得越来越数字化，但电梯也会像您生活中的其他设备一样老化，无论是家用电器还是洗衣机，它们都需要更换。在我们的案例中，它们需要在正在使用的建筑物中原地更换，我们称之为**现代化改造**（Modernization: 对现有设备进行升级以提升性能和延长寿命）。这确实是下一个巨大的市场，服务业务本身的利润率超过24%。这是一项“以人为本”的业务，我们有44,000名专业的现场机械师每天负责这项工作。这就是我们成为服务公司的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and if it and if it doesn't pass the rate, they close it down, right? They close it down or they require repair. So, the repair part of our business is part of our service business as well. Uh it's a break fix kind of business. These are electromechanical becoming more digital but but elevators age just like any other uh equipment you have in your in your life. Um whether it's an appliance whether it's a washing machine and and they need to to be replaced and in our case they need to be replaced in place in a live building and we call that modernization and that's that's really the next big market service business itself uh over 24% in terms of of margin. Um, and it's a it's a people business. It's where we've got 44,000 uh professional field mechanics who take care of that every day. That's why we're a service company.</p>
</details>

您在特定地区非常强大，对吗？国家、地区。我不会说你们瓜分了世界，当然没有，但例如，你们在西班牙非常强大。请告诉我们你们特别强大的地区以及原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, now you're very strong in particular regions, right? Uh, countries, areas. Um, now I wouldn't say you have kind of card the the world up amongst you because of course you haven't, but you know, you for instance are very strong in Spain. Uh, just what are the tell us about the areas where you are particularly strong and why?</p>
</details>

是的，这又回到了密度问题。我们不衡量或不要求我们的团队成为全球第一。我要求他们成为各自市场的佼佼者。我们通过四个区域进入市场，这些区域又细分为运营单位、运营区域，最终形成1400个分支机构。这1400个分支机构都是小型**损益表**（P&L: Profit and Loss statement，指公司的盈利或亏损情况），它们各有优缺点。但其中一部分是历史遗留问题。我们是一家美国公司，1853年在纽约扬克斯成立。因此，我们在美国的实力很强。我们是该市场的领导者，这是一个非常有吸引力的市场，我们对我们的业绩非常满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think again and it gets back to density. Um we try and and we don't measure or I don't challenge our team to be number one globally. I challenge them to be tops in their own markets. And and we go to market obviously through four regions. And these regions all break down into operating units, operating areas and eventually 1400 branches. These 1400 branches are small P&Ls. They each have strengths and weaknesses. Um but but part of it is is legacy in terms of where we are. We are a US company. We were founded in Yoners, New York in 1853. Um so so our US strength is strong. We're number one in that market and that's a a very um a very attractive market for us and one where we're we're very pleased with our with our results.</p>
</details>

为什么你们在中国不够强大？这很有趣。我们40年前进入中国。我们是第一批进入中国的美国公司之一，从天津开始，然后遍布全国。但现在我们在中国排名第三，我刚来的时候是第四。我认为，如果您看看2000年至2015年间对中国的投资，在前母公司旗下，我们没有像一些竞争对手那样大规模投资和扩张。我不想重提旧事，我认为当时增长确实强劲，但还不够强劲。回到您刚才的另一个问题，南欧对我们来说是一个非常有吸引力的市场。仅在西班牙，我们就拥有超过25万台设备。想想欧洲的密度，每栋建筑，想想任何城市，看看奥斯陆这里，一旦超过三层楼，每栋建筑至少有一部电梯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um why are you not stronger in China? Well, so it's interesting. Uh we got to China 40 years ago. Uh we were one of the first American companies in we started in Tenzin and spread throughout the throughout the country. Um, but I I think if you were now number three in China, we used to be number four when I first got here. Uh, I think if you look at um the investments that were made in China between 2000 and 2015, uh, we did not invest and expand to the same scale as some of our competitors under the former parent. Uh, I'm I I'm not revisiting that. I think it was just uh there was really strong growth, just not strong enough. Um, but yeah, back to your other question. Uh the southern Europe is a very very attractive business for us. Um you know we've got over a quarter of a million units in in Spain alone. Uh and you think about density in Europe where every building every building. Think of any city. Look out here in Oslo. You know once you get past three stories uh there's at least one one lift in every in every building.</p>
</details>

### 人口结构驱动因素与未来创新

请告诉我关于驱动因素系列，因为你们有一些非常强大的长期人口结构驱动因素。您如何看待它们？对于一个已经存在了172年的企业，我们仍然拥有这些令人兴奋的**大趋势**（Mega Trends: 影响深远的长期社会、经济、环境或技术变化），它们预示着增长空间。**城镇化**（Urbanization: 人口从农村地区向城市地区迁移的趋势）仍然存在。我们看到了城镇化，我们把建筑建得又高又密。但如果您考虑新兴市场，甚至成熟市场，人们仍在向城市迁移。仅在中国，至少还有2.5亿人希望从农村搬离，摆脱贫困，迁往城市地区。东南亚、印度正在经历巨大的城镇化进程。但我们甚至看到，即使在北欧和世界其他地区，设备业务仍在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M. So tell me about the driver series because you got you got some really powerful long-term demographic drivers. Just what how do you see them? Yeah. So so for a business that's been around we'll go on 172 years in September, we still have these these these mega trends um that that get you excited and and actually show room for growth. Uh urbanization remains um you know we've seen the urbanization. So we kind of we pile them high. We p we high and dense. Uh but if you think about um emerging markets and even mature markets, people are still moving to cities. Uh China alone, there's still another at least 250 million people that they want to move off the farms, raise out of poverty and move to urban areas. Southeast Asia, India is going through a tremendous amount of of urbanization. Um but we're even seeing that uh you know the business is still growing even on the equipment side in in Northern Europe uh and in in the rest of the world.</p>
</details>

是什么推动了这里的增长？我们变老了，爬不动楼梯了。是的，这是第二个趋势，即**人口老龄化**（Aging Population: 社会中老年人口比例增加的现象）。我不再谈论我们变老，我用“长寿”这个词。这听起来对您和我都更好。但如果您考虑老龄化人口和需求，人们希望在年老时留在自己的家中。我们看到各地老年人生活建筑的兴起，但如果我们能为家庭增加移动性，随着我们都变老，人们需要这个。接下来，我们已经在许多建筑中应用并证明了我们的能力，即允许机器人操作电梯，这些**人形机器人**（Humanoids: 具有人类外形和能力的机器人）将能够控制电梯，进入并为长寿的人们提供服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is driving it here? The fact that we get older and can't manage to walk the stairs. Yeah, that's the second trend which is which is um you know is the aging population. I I actually stopped talking about us getting older and I I use the term longevity. Yeah, it sounds better for you and I totally. But if you think about the the aging population and the demand needs, um people want to stay in their homes as they age. Uh we're seeing uh senior living pick up everywhere uh in terms of buildings, but if we can add mobility to homes uh as we all age, uh people need that. And then as you the the next the next step which we've already we already used and have proven in lots of buildings is our ability to allow robots to operate uh elevators which will then be humanoids who have the ability to to control the elevator to come in and and to be able to deliver services to to people as they as they live longer.</p>
</details>

您是一个非常重要的服务企业。您见过最好的服务是什么？您有过的最佳服务体验是什么？我可以说我们最好的服务在日本。那里对卓越有很高的期望。规范更高，客户的要求也更高。当然，我们必须在每部电梯中安装**地震传感器**（Earthquake Sensor: 用于检测地震并触发安全措施的设备），因为该国的性质和需求。但日本对质量有很高的期望。这并非我们行业独有，但在我们行业中确实如此。如果我们在日本的电梯发生故障，客户必须拨打奥的斯热线寻求机械师帮助，我们的分公司经理会亲自拜访客户，解释发生的原因，道歉，并确保不再发生。这在世界其他任何地方都不会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you are you are a very important service business. Um what's the best service you have seen anywhere? What's the best service experience you've ever had? Uh I would tell you our best service is in Japan. Um and it's an expectation there. It's an expectation of excellence. The code is higher. The demand the requirements are higher from the customers. Uh and it's not even in the sophistication of of course we have to have an earthquake sensor in every elevator due to the due the nature of the uh the country and the needs. Um, but there is an expectation of quality in Japan. Not unique to our industry, but certainly in our industry. If we have an elevator breakdown in Japan and we have to uh they have to call our Otus line, our help line for for a request for a mechanic because because our elevator stopped, our branch manager actually goes physically to see that customer to explain what happened, to apologize, and to make sure it doesn't happen again. That doesn't happen anywhere else in the world.</p>
</details>

不。这很有趣，因为如果您问我最好的服务体验是什么，我会说是京都的一家**日式旅馆**（Ryokan: 日本传统旅馆）。那简直令人难以置信。我记得在留言簿上，有希尔顿家族成员的签名，她说这完美诠释了服务的真谛。它给我留下了深刻的印象，那种个性化的、亲自处理的方式。为什么这在日本如此特别？我认为这是一种文化期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Well, that you know it's so interesting because if you had asked me what's best service experience I ever had, I would say it was in a Rio Khan in Coyoto. A Rioan is a guest house and it was just unbelievable. And I remember in the guest book it was uh signed by I think it was one of the first Hiltons you know she said this epitomizes what service should be all about. And it made such an impression on me just personality you know the way they handled you personally. So why tell me why is this specific to Japan? I I I I think it's cultural expectation.</p>
</details>

我告诉您，另一部分是，在日本，他们也认识到他们是最大、老龄化最快的社会。因此，他们有相应的规划。我将其与我们的业务联系起来，这可能是我们处理零件和设备**报废**（Obsolescence: 物品因过时或不再有用而失去价值）方面最成熟的业务。所以，他们有一种提前思考一切的心态，然后极度以客户为中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I would tell you the other part of it which are and you know they stood they stood outside the guest house and they waited until they couldn't see us anymore. You know when it took us 5 minutes to walk down the street and they were just standing there. Unbelievable. Yeah. The other the other part though is is there's also a recognition in Japan of they are the the largest the the most rapidly aging society. So there's there's planning in place and and how I would correlate that to our business is it's probably the most mature business we have in dealing with obsolescence of parts and of equipment. So there's this just this me mental mindset of thinking of everything in advance and then being extremely customer focused.</p>
</details>

您是否试图让奥的斯更像一家日本公司？我认为在心态和以客户为中心方面绝对是。我们是日本电梯行业中唯一的非日本公司，我们已经在那儿很久了，我相信超过70年。我们从中学到了很多，我们也会轮换我们的领导团队，特别是我的任期内的最高层领导都是非日本人，这样他们可以体验并带回自己的国家。但我们会在团队内部分享经验教训。但期望值非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So are you trying to make Otis um more of a Japanese company? Um I think there's mindset mindset customer centricity absolutely. Uh we're the only non-Japanese player in Japan in our industry and we've been there for a long time uh over 70 years I believe. Um and and we've learned a lot from that and we do rotate our leaders through there especially uh the last at least the leaders um in my tenure have all at the top have all been non-Japanese so they can experience it and then take it back to their country. Uh but we share lessons learned amongst amongst the group. Um but but expectations very high.</p>
</details>

### 法规与行业护城河

电梯有哪些类型的法规？法规因城市、国家和世界各地而异。我们称之为**规范**（Code: 指特定行业或领域的技术标准和规则），有非常具体的安全标准、限制和检查制度规范。有些国家规定必须按计划进行维护，而另一些国家则由您控制，维护时间不固定，但必须达到目标。即使在美国，我认为我们在南卡罗来纳州佛罗伦萨的工厂也需要根据70或80多种不同的规范进行生产，仅仅是为了支持美国和加拿大市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What type of regulations are there for elevators? Oh, there's there's regulations that vary by city, by country, by parts of the world. Um very specific we call it code uh very specific codes on safety standards, on limitations, on inspection regimes. Uh we have some countries where the maintenance has to happen. it's regulated by by by schedule. Uh others where you have the control and it's unscheduled but you have to meet the objectives. Uh but if you go even in the US uh I think our factory in Florence, South Carolina builds to over 70 or 80 different codes just to support the US and Canada.</p>
</details>

这给您带来了什么样的**护城河**（Moat: 商业中指企业难以被竞争对手模仿的竞争优势）？这非常巨大。巨大。这就是为什么我们如此整合的原因。首先，客户会信任一个全新的品牌吗？再次强调，您是在将人们的生命托付给他们。其次，这个护城河意味着没有一个全球标准，没有一个全球要求。因此，对于一个新进入者来说，要想真正打入一个城市以上的市场，需要大量的知识、投资和风险管理，这就是我认为这个行业如此整合的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what kind of mold does that provide you with? I mean is different. That's tremendous. Tremendous. Uh which is why we haven't had why we're so consolidated. Um, first of all, you know, are are customers going to trust a brand new brand? Uh, again, you're trusting them with people's lives. Uh, but second, you have this moat that says there is no one global standard. There's no one global uh requirement. Uh, so uh for someone to enter and to and to truly hit larger than a one city market uh takes a tremendous amount of knowledge, investment, risk management uh and that's why I think it's so consolidated.</p>
</details>

为什么电梯从不坠落？它们很少坠落。如果您仔细想想，您几乎听不到这样的消息。它们只是挂在那里，靠着一根绳子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do they never fall down? Elevators. Yeah. Well, there's a very rarely. I mean, you hardly hear about them if you think about it. They just kind of hang there in a rope and then</p>

### 安全系统与机械师的重要性

嗯，有一样东西叫做**配重块**（Counterweight: 电梯系统中用于平衡轿厢重量的装置）。您可以看到它们。我们昨天在蒙克博物馆，那不是我们的电梯，但它是玻璃的，所以您可以看到电梯运行时配重块也在移动。但在蒙克博物馆，我们看到了焦虑的画面。您的电梯里很少有焦虑，对吗？目标就是没有焦虑。没有焦虑，也没有**困人事件**（Entrapments: 电梯故障导致乘客被困）。但困人事件偶尔会发生，比如停电或出现问题时。电梯比飞机更安全。您知道飞机有多安全。每天有这么多人使用，它是一项经过验证的技术。但我认为它如此安全的最大原因在于它拥有**多重冗余安全系统**（Multi-redundant Safety System: 包含多个独立备份组件，以确保在部分组件失效时系统仍能正常运行）。我们称之为**安全链**（Safety Chain: 一系列相互关联的安全装置，确保电梯在任何故障情况下都能安全停止）。因此，有三层安全保护，这就是您从不坠落的原因。总有一个机械层，还有一个**限速器**（Governor: 电梯安全装置，在超速时触发安全钳），您有能力通过安全装置确保人们停下来。

<p class="english-text">Well, there is this thing called a counterwe, right? And you can see them. We were in the monk museum yesterday and it was not our elevator, but you could see the it was glass, so you could see the uh the counterwe moving as the elevator goes. Um, but I mean in the monk museum, we saw pictures of angst. There's very little angst in your in your elevators, right? That's the goal is is no angst. No angst and no uh no enttrapments. But the enttrapments do happen on occasion when power goes out when when there are issues. Uh the elevator is uh it's safer to be in an elevator than fly in an airplane. And you know how safe airplanes are. Um again with so many people every day using it, it's uh it's a proven technology. But I think the biggest reason that that it's so safe is it's got it's got, you know, a multi-redundant safety system. We call it a safety chain. Uh so there's there's three layers of safety, which is why you never fall. Uh there's there's always a mechanical layer, but there's you have a governor and you just have the ability uh with the safeties to to make sure that people stop.</p>

今天的未来，以及我们现在的一些产品中已经看到的，是确保当您停下来时，即使是紧急情况，您也能停在某个层站，这样人们就不会被困在楼层之间。这是人们可能遇到的最糟糕的经历。消防队会赶到，他们可能不得不破墙而入。所以，这是可行的。但挑战在于，Nicolai，我们有电梯。好消息是我们制造了可靠的电梯。我们有一些电梯已经使用了50、70年甚至更久。我见过一些19世纪90年代的电梯。它们经过现代化改造，但你知道，随着技术的发展，每天有2200万部电梯和自动扶梯在使用。有大量的**装机量**（Installed Base: 指已安装并投入使用的产品数量）需要不断现代化，使其技术更先进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The that today's the future and and what we're seeing already today in some of our offerings is making sure that when you stop, even if they it has to be an emergency, you you you actually stop at a landing so that people don't get caught between floors. Uh which is which is the worst experience someone can have. the fire brigade will show up and they have to break through a wall or something. So, that's available. But the challenge, Nikolai, is we have elevators. The beautiful news is we've built reliable elevators. Uh we have elevators that have been around 50 70 years. Um and more. I've been in some from the 1890s. So, they get modernized, but you know, again, as that technology gets applied, there's 22 million elevators and escalators in use every day. uh there's a lot of install base to get to to continue to modernize and make things more technologically uh advanced.</p>
</details>

拥有高密度的装机量为什么重要？这关乎您的服务团队的生产力。如果您在路线上拥有高密度，人们就不必长途跋涉，减少非生产性时间，您就能拥有更高效率的机械师。如果您能为他们提供工具和技术帮助，那就更好了。但这始于一个非常基本的路线规划算法。这就是我们许多人早年遇到的数学挑战：当您有这种密度时，如何制定路线？它让您能够做到，如果一个机械师昨天能处理11部电梯，如何让同一个机械师一天处理12部电梯？我用这些数字只是作为代表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is it important to have the installed base to have a high density of install base? Well, it's all about uh productivity and and of your service fleet, right? So, if you can along route have the density where people don't have to travel and have much as much non-productive time, uh you have the ability to have more productive mechanics and if you can give them the tools and technology to help them, that's even better. But it it starts with a very basic algorithm on on routing. Um which is you know the kind of the the math challenge that that many of us had earlier in life. How do you how do you develop a route when you have that density? It gives you that ability to you know if a mechanic yesterday can handle 11, how do you get that same mechanic to handle 12 elevators in a day? And I use those numbers as just representative.</p>

很高兴听到您谈论您的44,000名机械师，您几乎要热泪盈眶。我清楚地看到您热爱您的机械师。我确实如此。我希望他们知道。请告诉我关于他们的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's nice to hear you talk about your 44,000 mechanics because you nearly get tears in your eyes. I It's just clear to me that you love your mechanics. I do. And I I hope they know. Tell me about them. Tell me about them.</p>
</details>

这是一个有趣的行业，这是一个“以人为本”的行业。这些机械师是专业人士。我努力给予他们应得的尊重。在我们公司，我不用“员工”这个词，我用“同事”这个词，因为我认为这更尊重。但没有我们的机械师，我们就无法开展业务。这44,000名机械师都非常敬业。我称之为“谦逊的骄傲”。他们关心奥的斯。他们中许多人的父亲也曾是我们的机械师。这是一种非常代代相传的行业。这个行业已经发生了很大的变化。它不再那么机械化，不再需要那么多润滑油和机油。它更多的是故障排除和数字化。但仍然需要机械方面的专业人员。所以，我们有44,000名机械师，他们通常不会出现在办公室，或者很少。我们会在工作现场进行安全会议。但这些人工作相对独立，但他们是我们公司的一部分，他们的成功就是我们的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So So it's an interesting business. Um it's a people business. Yeah. And these mechanics are professionals. And I I I I try to show them the respect they deserve. Uh I don't use the word employees in our company. I use the word colleagues because I think it's respectful. Uh but we have no business without our mechanics. Um and uh these 44,000 are dedicated. I call it a humble pride. They care about Otis. Um, many of them, their fathers worked for us as mechanics. It's very much a trade that gets passed down. Uh, the trades changed quite a bit. It's not as mechanical. Uh, it's not as much lube and oil anymore. It's it's a lot more uh trouble find troubleshooting and digital. Uh, but there's still that mechanical need for people. And so, we're calling on 44,000 mechanics who don't typically show up at an office ever. Uh, or very rare. We'll do we'll do safety huddles. We'll do those at job sites. But but these are people who work fairly independently but are part of our company and as they succeed we succeed.</p>
</details>

您甚至会给他们一些硬币或奖章。请告诉我关于这个。我确实有。出于尊重，我制作了一枚硬币。这是我的CEO硬币。它有这么大。它们都有编号，每当我看到工作现场的机械师时，我都会感谢他们，告诉他们他们是我们公司的核心和灵魂，他们确实如此。我们的增长受限于机械师的能力和数量。自我们独立以来的五年里，我们增加了超过10%的机械师。去年我们增加了2,000名。今年我们会增加更多。这就是我们的增长限制因素。信不信由你，这就是我们的增长限制因素。所以，在**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器）的世界里，我们没有裁员，我们正在增加机械师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh if you even have you even have a like a coin or a medal that you give some of them. Tell me about I do. I have a um you know out of respect I have a a coin that I've made. It's my CEO coin. Uh it's about this big. Um they're all numbered and anytime I get to see a mechanic at a job site uh I thank them and I tell them they're the heart and soul of our company and they are um you know our growth is limited to our mechanics capabilities and the number of mechanics we have. We've added uh over 10% uh of mechanics since in the 5 years since we became independent. Uh we're going to add we added 2,000 last year. We we'll add more this year. That's our growth limiter. Believe it or not, that's our growth limiter. So in in the world of AI um we're not shrinking we're we're adding mechanics.</p>
</details>

您是从哪里得到这个硬币的想法的？我听说过军队里有这个。是的，我职业生涯早期在国防业务，航空航天和国防领域工作，我一直觉得这很有意义。对我来说，当您能亲自感谢他们时，影响力更大。而且只给机械师。主管们看着我，他们会说：“那我呢？”我说：“不，不，不。你们是管理团队的一部分。我们通过其他方式奖励你们，但这只是我表达感谢的方式。”我们的大部分机械师都通过**集体谈判**（Collective Bargaining: 劳资双方就工作条件等进行谈判）在全球范围内获得代表。我知道人们倾向于认为这是一种以欧洲为中心的事情。显然，我们在欧洲各地都有劳资委员会，但我们的美国员工、韩国员工、日本员工都有代表。对我们来说，这是我们一直以来的经营方式。我们尊重并以这种方式工作，而且效果很好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Where did you get the idea of the coin? I mean I've I've heard about that from the army. Um yeah I was in the defense business uh earlier in my career aerospace and defense and I always found it um meaningful. Um to me it's it's more impactful though when you can uh do it in person and with a thank you. And it's only mechanics. I I the supervisors look at me and they're like how about me? And I'm like, "No, no, no. You're part of you're part of the the management team. Um, we we reward you other ways, but it's just it's my way of saying thank you." And most of our mechanics are are part of uh are part most of our labor is represented by collective bargaining all over the world. I know people tend to think of that as a Europe ccentric thing. Uh obviously we have works councils across Europe, but our our US workforce is represented, our Korean workforce, our Japanese workforce. For us, it's the way we've always done business. we respect and and work with work this way and it it works fine.</p>
</details>

为什么更多的美国公司不以这种方式与员工合作？我无法评论这一点。我们的关系很牢固。我们有一个多行业的工会，在美国和加拿大的每一项工作，无论是安装还是服务，都由我们的劳动力完成。

<p class="english-text">Why don't more US companies do it do work with workforce this way? Yeah, I I can't talk to that. Our our relationship's strong.

### 电梯行业的创新

谈到创新，您现在在电梯行业看到了哪些最有趣的创新？有几项。我认为最有趣且可能影响最大的，是**互联电梯**（Connected Elevators: 通过物联网技术连接到网络的电梯）领域。我们有100万部电梯连接到**物联网**（IoT: Internet of Things: 互联网之物，指通过网络连接的物理设备），因此我们拥有庞大的**数据湖**（Data Lake: 存储大量原始数据的中央存储库），可以进行**预防性维护**（Preventive Maintenance: 在设备发生故障前进行的维护）和**预测性维护**（Prognostic Maintenance: 基于数据分析预测设备故障并进行维护），并保持透明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to innovation, what are the most interesting innovations that you are seeing just now in the elevator industry? There's a few uh I'd say the the most interesting that'll probably have the largest impact is in the world of connected elevators. Um so whether it's the IoT connection where we've got a million of our elevators connected so we have a huge data lake so that we can do preventive and eventually prognostic maintenance but be transparent. So IoT just to so that's internet of things. internet of things.</p>
</details>

物联网就是**万物互联**（Internet of Things: 通过网络连接的物理设备）。设备运行和所有信息都以非常接近实时的方式发送给我们。我会用不同的方式来定义它。您从别墅电梯获取信息的方式，与您从丽笙蓝标酒店获取信息的方式略有不同，这取决于您获取信息的周期性。但这为我们提供了关于电梯及其运行方式的巨大信息。不仅我们的现场机械师可以看到，我们的奥的斯热线服务台也可以看到，我们的客户也可以看到。因此，我们为他们提供了一个仪表盘，让他们可以看到设备的健康状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it's the equipment operation and and everything being sent to us on a a very uh pseudo real-time basis. I'll I'll define it differently. You need information from from a villa uh elevator a little differently than you need it from the Rison Blue uh in terms of the the period periodicity of how often you get it. Um, but it gives us tremendous information on the elevator, uh, how it operates. And not only can our mechanic see that, our field mechanic, our Otus line help desk can see it, and our customers can see it. And so we give them a dashboard so they can see the health status of their equipment.</p>
</details>

但我认为它将带我们走向何方，我知道它将带我们走向何方，那就是我们进行定期维护时，能够说：“听着，这个来回移动门的**门机**（Door Operator: 控制电梯门开关的装置），我们知道它在使用15,000次后（我随便举个数字），将需要校准或更换。”因此，当我们进行定期维护时，我们可以在它发生故障之前更换或校准它。这种**正常运行时间**（Uptime: 设备或系统正常运行的时间比例）对人们很重要，因为人们只在电梯不工作时才关心它。当电梯不工作时，他们会环顾四周，说：“哦，是的，我被困在电梯里了，或者自动扶梯坏了。”所以，对我们来说，正常运行时间绝对至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but I think where it's going to I know where it's going to take us is the our ability as we do scheduled maintenance to say, "Listen, this door operator that's moving the doors back and forth, we know at I'll make a up a number at 15,000 uses, um, it's going to either need alignment or replacement. So, when we're doing scheduled maintenance anyway and and coming by to do all of our our scheduled maintenance, we can either replace it or align it before it ever breaks. And that matters that that uptime matters to people because people only care about elevators when they're not working as you and I know that's when they that's when they look around they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm in I'm in an elevator and I and I have an issue or or there's a you know there's a block and I can't use the escalator." Um so for us that uptime is is is absolutely critical.</p>
</details>

但这种连接超越了我们的客户。所以，这些是物业经理、公寓服务客户。现在，这种连接将延伸到乘客。我们有手机应用程序，您可以在公寓里呼叫自动扶梯或电梯，甚至在您到达之前。所以您实际上发出了呼叫，它会说：“好的，它在这里。”我们有许多办公楼，当您通过门禁系统、旋转门进入时，安全系统会识别您，然后告诉您去哪里。我们还有一些客户，它不仅会告诉您去哪里，还会知道如果您要去八楼并且是第一个到达的人，当您到达时，它会打开该楼层的灯。所以，我们是建筑生态系统的一部分。我喜欢把我们看作是脊梁。但同样，当我们了解交通流量时，我们拥有世界上每栋建筑的交通流量数据。所以，这是一个巨大的数据分析量，可以帮助我们。但也许您想选择自己的音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So but that connected goes beyond the c our customers. So those are property managers, condominium service customers. Um the the connected is going to go to the passenger now. So we have apps on on your phones where you can call the escalator from your from your apartment before you ever or the elevator before you ever get to it. So you actually make the call and it says, "Okay, it's here." Um, we have many office buildings where as you pass through the the the access control, the turn style to get in, the security to get in, it recognizes you and then it tells you what what where to go. Uh, and then we have we have certain clients where not only does it uh tell you where to go, but it knows if you're going to the eighth floor and you're the first person there, as you get there, it turns on the lights on the floor. So, so we're part of a building ecosystem. I like to think of us as the spine. Um but again when we understand traffic we we we have traffic flow for every building in the world. So it's a tremendous amount of data analytics that can help us. But maybe you want to choose your own music.</p>
</details>

另一件事是，现在它们是上下移动的。它们什么时候会开始横向移动？我不太确定电梯的横向移动是否是电梯的最佳用途。有其他交通方式可以实现这一点，无论是自动人行道，还是您在机场乘坐过的移动车辆。我最后再提一点，我在我们的实验室里已经看到了。当您年老时，需要去看医生，您走进电梯，却不记得是几点？要去哪里？您可以对电梯说话，说：“我需要去看史密斯医生。”它就会带您去您需要去的地方。所以，这种乘客体验将随着技术的进步而不断改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the other thing which maybe I mean now they go up and down. When will they start to go sideways? You know I I'm not sure that the sideways for an elevator is the best use of an elevator. Um there's other modes of transit that that accomplish this. whether they're moving walkways, whether they're things you've you've been on in in airports where you have uh you know, moving moving vehicles. Um I just go back one last time to, you know, and I've seen this now in our in our labs. Um so if you think as you age and and you need to go to a doctor's office and you walk in the elevator and you don't you don't recall what is it? Is it 6:15? What what I don't know where I'm going, you can talk to the elevator and say, "I need to see Dr. Dr. Smith." uh and it it takes you where you need to go. So this passenger experience is going to continue to improve over time um and as technology improves.</p>

### 奥的斯从联合技术公司分拆后的领导力

谈到领导力。奥的斯是从一家名为联合技术公司（**United Technologies**：一家大型美国企业集团，后分拆）的**企业集团**（Conglomerate: 由多个不同业务领域公司组成的集团）中**分拆**（Spin-off: 将母公司的一部分业务独立出来成为新公司）出来的，这发生在新冠疫情期间。这很有挑战性，对吗？您从中学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh moving on to leadership. So um Otis came out of uh a conglomerate called United Technologies and this happened during COVID. So pretty challenging, right? What did you what did you learn from this?</p>
</details>

是的，我们当时正在准备。联合技术公司董事会于2018年11月决定进行**三方分拆**（Three-way Spin: 将公司分拆成三个独立实体）。当时，联合技术公司将保留，我们将作为奥的斯分拆，**开利**（Carrier: 供暖、通风与空调（HVAC）设备制造商）这家**暖通空调**（HVAC: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning）公司也将分拆。我们有16个月的时间来完成这项工作。与此同时，Nicolai，从奥的斯的角度来看，我们也在恢复盈利增长。那是我们证明自己不仅知道如何准备成为一家独立公司，而且向世界展示这一点的时刻。所以，我们用2019年进行准备和证明。然后，我们在2月份纽约证券交易所的行业投资者日上，对我们的**股权路演**（Equity Road Show: 公司在发行股票前向潜在投资者进行的推介活动）感到非常兴奋，计划在3月底进行。突然之间，世界发生了巨大的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so we were preparing uh the United Technologies board in November of 2018 decided that we were going to do a three-way spin. Mhm. Uh, United Technologies would remain at that time. Um, we would spin off as Otis and Carrier, the HVAC company, would spin off as well, and we had a 16-month window to complete this. Simultaneous to that, Nikolai, we were also uh from an Otis perspective returning to earnings growth. And that was our time to prove that we knew not just how to prepare to be an independent company, but to show that to the world. So we we took 2019 to prove that to prepare. Uh and then uh we were at our industry uh investor day in February at the New York Stock Exchange and all excited for our equity road show at the end of March and all of a sudden the world changed pretty drastically.</p>
</details>

所以，我们远程进行了股权路演。然后，我们在4月3日午夜，也就是新冠疫情最严重的时候，成立了公司。纽约证券交易所是远程的，一切都是远程的。我们知道我们必须前进。我们知道我们会分拆。我们知道这是正确的做法。我们知道我们已经准备好了。但当您想到4月3日，第一次结账，准备第一次财报电话会议，第一次董事会会议，所有一切都是远程进行。这需要巨大的**敏捷性**（Agility: 快速适应变化的能力）和**韧性**（Resilience: 从困难中恢复并适应的能力）。我们是一项基本服务。所以，世界某些地区的建筑业仍在继续，随着疫情在世界各地蔓延，我们从中国吸取了经验教训，中国在2月和3月已经经历了第一波疫情爆发，我们迅速将其推广到世界各地，并说：“这是您接触客户的方式。”我们有一些客户绝对需要我们，医院、交通枢纽。再次强调，出于对我现场团队的尊重，他们在疫情最严重的时候每天都在外面工作，去医院确保人们能得到照顾。这就是您看到我们使命产生共鸣的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we did the equity road show remote. Uh and then we we launched the company midnight on April 3rd right in the middle of COVID. New York Stock Exchange was remote. everything was remote and um and we knew we had to go. We knew we were going to spin. We knew it was the right thing to do. We knew we were prepared. But as you think about April 3rd, um closing the books for the first time, uh getting ready for your first earnings call, all of this first board meeting being everything being remote. Um it took a tremendous amount of agility, resilience, and we were an essential service. So construction continued in parts of the world uh and as co uh oscillated through parts of the world and what we did is we took the lessons from China which had already gone through that first burst in February and March and quickly moved it around the world and said here's how you get to customers. We had customers who absolutely needed us, hospitals, transit, and again back to my respect for our field. They were out there every day in the middle of this this Corona virus um going to going to c hospitals to make sure that people could be taken care of. And that's that's kind of where you see this resonance with our mission.</p>
</details>

所以，我们必须经营业务，我们必须领导，我们必须沟通。当时我住在公寓里。我们正在重建我们的公寓，我和我丈夫住在一个小公寓里。我当时在进行实时沟通，他充当我的摄影师。我们从一个非常空旷的地方与公司进行实时沟通。事实上，我的传播负责人会打电话给我，她说：“你至少在背景放一盆植物或一件艺术品吗？”我说：“不，不，这只是暂时的。”我说：“这会让人们倾听信息。”所以，我们团结了团队，我们不仅度过了难关，而且我告诉您，我们做好了准备，迎接繁荣和加速。我记得在第一年结束时，我召集了领导团队，我说：“好了，准备加速。”他们说：“Judy，我们正处于**黑天鹅事件**（Black Swan Event: 指不可预测且影响巨大的事件）之中。我们从未面对过这样的事情。我们的团队表现得非常好。服务业务也表现良好。这给了我们韧性。”在此期间，我没有解雇任何一位同事。我们都降薪了。我们做了所有必须做的事情，因为我知道我们会回来。我不知道什么时候，但Nicolai，我知道我们会回来。所以，在第一年结束时，我说：“准备加速。”我说：“因为比赛将在1月1日重新开始。我们是一家新公司，我们必须强劲开局。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we had to run a business, we had to lead, and we had to communicate. And I was I was on from a from an apartment. We were rebuilding our our condominium and my husband and I were living in a small apartment. I was doing real time he was he was my he was my cinematographer and we were doing real time communication with the company um from a from a a very vacant uh uh place. As a matter of fact, my communications person would call me and she'd say, "Do you at least have a plant to put in the background or a piece of artwork?" And I said, "No, no, this is temporary." I said, "Let this will make people listen to the message." So we we rallied the team uh and um and and got not just got through it, but I would tell you we we got ready to to thrive and accelerate. And I remember at the end of the first year um I I got the leadership team together and I and I said, "Okay, get ready to accelerate." And they said, "Dude, we're in the middle of a black swan event. I mean, we've never faced anything like this. Our teams responded incredibly well. The service business held up well. It gave us that resilience. Uh, I was I did not lay off a single colleague during this time period. We we all took we took cuts. We did whatever we had to because I knew we would come back. I didn't know when, but at Nikolai, I knew we'd come back. And so, at the end of that first year, I said, "Get ready to accelerate." And I said, "Because the race is going to start again on January 1st. We're a new company and we've got to come out of the gates strong."</p>
</details>

有趣的是，那些没有裁员的公司恢复得如此强劲，我们在许多行业都看到了这一点。当您分拆时，基本上意味着您将公司分成几部分，对吗？所以您有了自己的身份，以及**问责制**（Accountability: 对自己的行为负责）。这通常会释放出令人难以置信的能量。那么您在奥的斯看到了什么？这对人们来说意味着什么，拥有自己的品牌名称？是的，他们喜欢它，而且它不仅仅是写在门上。我们的机械师们完全把它穿在身上。为什么这对人们如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's interesting how the companies you know who didn't lay off people came back so much stronger and we see it in so many industries but um when you uh so a spin basically means that you split the company into several pieces right so you get your own identity and so on and and and accountability totally and that uh very often unleashes this incredible energy right so how did you see that in Otis what did it meant to what did it mean to people to have to have their own kind of name on the on the Yeah, they they loved it and it's it's not on the door, right? Our mechanics wear it totally on their door. Why is it so important for people?</p>
</details>

我认为人们渴望成为更大事业的一部分。他们想理解目标。他们想理解，在我们的案例中，他们与“如何让世界运转”产生共鸣。但我想他们也希望得到认可。当您是一个企业集团的一部分时，企业集团的财报电话会议，我们只是一行。我们只是财报中的一行。我们只是一个单行细分市场，所以能见度很低。随着时间的推移，这种问责制，如果我们季度表现不佳，其他部门会弥补。您没有那种无处可藏的感觉。所以，那种确保我们所做的一切都至关重要的动力。我们正在摆脱那些不重要的举措。我们不必做那些对别人重要但对奥的斯可能不重要的事情。所以，每天100%专注于运营纪律和重要事项，这就是体现在结果中的。人们会团结起来。

<p class="english-text">Um, I think it's people want to be part of something uh bigger. They want to understand purpose. They want to understand and in our case, they they resonate with how they keep the world moving. Um, but I think they also want to be appreciated. And you know, when you're part of a conglomerate, uh, you know, the earnings calls for the conglomerate, you know, we were one line. um we were one line in the in the releases. We were one we were a oneline segment so there was very little visibility and um over time you know that accountability if we had had a bad if we had a bad quarter one of the other divisions made up for it. You don't have that there's nowhere to hide. Um so so that that that that drive to make sure everything we were doing mattered. We were getting rid of of initiatives that didn't matter. we weren't having to do things that were important to someone else but maybe not to Otis. So that that 100% focus every day on on discipline on operating and on on what mattered um is what shows in the results and people people they rally.</p>

有一本书叫做《我们力量》，讲的是您想属于谁以及这意味着什么。这对您意味着什么？这只是一个例子，说明您属于一个更小、更负责任的实体，这会产生很大的影响。您在联合技术公司内部被视为**现金奶牛**（Cash Call: 指能持续产生大量现金流但增长潜力有限的业务）运营了八年，没有显示出盈利增长。管理层被视为现金奶牛运营，您认为他们感觉如何？

是的，我当时大部分时间不在那里，但显然有一种观点。我们是在1976年被收购的。所以您想想这家公司成立于1853年。第一次在纽约证券交易所上市是1920年，讽刺的是，在我们几乎在同一个月重新上市的100年前。随着时间的推移，奥的斯的服务业务很强劲，但在**全球金融危机**（GFC: Global Financial Crisis: 2008年左右的全球经济衰退）之后，我们的定价与金融危机脱节，价格高得多。作为母公司的一部分，人们被激励的指标有两个：利润和现金流。当您这样做而不激励任何组织的增长时，您可能会达到一个收获业务的阶段，奥的斯当时正在被收获。现金流大于1%或1.0，就现金流与净收入而言。我们现在仍然保持这一点。我们仍然在这样做，我为此感到自豪。但它产生了巨大的现金，这些现金流向了母公司，母公司进行**资本配置**（Capital Allocation: 公司将资金分配到不同投资和项目的方式），这是我们现在显然自己做的事情。作为资本配置的一部分，他们希望在其他部门进行一项非常重要的投资，而不是投资于中国的电梯业务。在中国的电梯业务服务方面，我们作为奥的斯在母公司旗下的一些年份里，**研发**（R&D: Research and Development: 研究与开发）占销售额的百分比远低于1%，**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure: 资本支出）也远低于1%。所以，它确实是，你知道，甚至IT系统都相当陈旧，但这些都是企业集团可以做出的资本决策。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I I I I was not there during most of that time but uh there was clearly a view um and so we were acquired in 1976. So you think about the company formed in 1853. First time on the New York Stock Exchange was 1920 ironically a 100red years before we went back almost the same month. Um and and over time uh Otis' service business was strong, but post the GFC we were we were out of out of sync with our pricing was much higher than financial crisis. Yeah, sorry. Greater financial crisis. Um so uh as part of the parent there were two two metrics that people were incentivized on uh profit and cash flow and when you do that and you don't incentivize on growth in any organization uh you can get to a point where you harvest a business and o Otis was being harvested uh the cash flow greater than 1% or or 1.0 0 in terms of of cash flow to to net income. Uh and we we maintain that now. We're still doing it which which which I'm proud of. But um but it it threw off tremendous cash and that cash went to the parent and the parent did the capital allocation which is something we obviously do ourselves now. As part of that capital allocation, they had a very significant investment they wanted to make in a in a in other divisions instead of uh investing in the elevator business in China. uh in elevator business in China service I mean our R&D as a percent of sales during some of those years as Otus under the parent was far less than 1% our capex was far less than 1%. So it was truly it was you know the the even the IT systems were rather antiquated but but those were capital decisions that cor that a conglomerate gets to make.</p>

### 企业文化与核心原则

那么，您接手后，在企业文化方面改变了什么？我们一直忠于自我。我们专注于我们称之为“**绝对原则**”（Absolutes: 公司内部不可妥协的核心价值观）的东西。其他人称之为价值观。价值观是一个有趣的词，但“绝对原则”真正划定了界限，即这是“可行/不可行”的。您必须做到这些才能成为我们公司的一部分。安全一直是奥的斯的绝对原则。它必须是。它已经从身体安全扩展到普遍的福祉。人们在危险情况下工作，在高空作业，接触电力。我们确实有17家制造工厂，但我们的大部分员工都在现场。所以安全至关重要。我认为在过去几年里，我们已经将身体健康的安全性扩展到普遍的福祉。如果我们的同事心不在焉，他们可能会受伤，甚至更糟。所以，安全是第一位的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how have you what have you in terms of the corporate culture uh what have you changed since you took over? Well, we've stayed uh we've stayed true to who we are. We've um focused on something we call our absolutes. Uh other people call this um you know a values for us. Values is an interesting term, but absolutes really sets the line that uh it's it's a go no-go. You have to do these to be part of our company. Uh safety was always an absolute at Otis. It needs to be. Uh it's expanded from physical safety. again people working in dangerous situations working at heights exposed to electricity. Um we do have 17 manufacturing plants but again the majority of our workforce is in the field. Uh so safety is critical and I think what we've seen over the past few years is we've added to the physical well-being of safety to well-being in general. Uh we have our if our colleagues don't have their mind in their work they can get hurt uh or worse or even worse. So, so safety is first.</p>
</details>

我们的第二个绝对原则是**道德**（Ethics: 道德规范）。对我们来说，**合规性**（Compliance: 遵守法律、法规和内部政策）绝对至关重要，但更重要的是，即使没有人监督，也要做正确的事情，尤其是在独自工作时。最后一个，我刚来时我们改变了它，原来是“控制”，我觉得这很有趣，但不是所有72,000名同事都能参与的。对我来说，“质量”是正确的第三个绝对原则。所以我们专注于此。但我们也创造了一种文化，我们希望听到每个人的声音。最好的想法来自公司内部，但它们不是来自我，也不是来自领导团队。它们来自与客户在一起的团队，无论是销售团队还是现场团队。我们希望听到这些声音。所以我们希望听到每个人的声音。我们创造了一个环境，让声音被听到，我们每一位同事不仅有能力，也有责任在他们认为不安全时停止工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Our our second absolute is ethics. And for us, you know, compliance is absolutely critical, but more importantly, doing the right thing even when no one's looking is critical, especially when you're working alone. Uh, and the last one, which which we changed when I got there, it was controls, which I thought was interesting, but more not something that all 72,000 colleagues could participate in. And to me, just quality was the right right third absolute. So we focused on that. Um but we also uh created a culture where we want every voice to be heard. Uh the best ideas come from inside the company, but they they don't come from me. They don't come from the leadership team. They come from our team that's that's out with customers, whether they're sales, whether they're field. Uh and and we want to hear those. So we wanted every voice to be heard. and and we've created an environment where the voices are heard and every single one of our colleagues has the not just the ability but the responsibility to stop work if they don't think that do do people disagree with you inside the company?</p>

公司内部有人不同意您的意见吗？当然。您如何处理？大多数时候处理得很好，但并非总是如此，我坦白说。我认为重要的是，他们经常是对的吗？哦，是的，他们更接近实际情况。你知道，我有点觉得，如果您决定所有事情，公司永远不会比您更好。如果您结合了各种意见，您可以创造出令人难以置信的事物。是的，这很棒。我有一个非常简单的电子邮件和手机号码，大多数人都有，无论是公司内部还是外部。我直接收到客户投诉。我阅读我所有的电子邮件。没有人过滤任何东西。它不会进入另一个邮箱。我认为了解正在发生的事情很重要。但我认为文化很重要，在我们的案例中，有一种我称之为“谦逊的骄傲”，但更有一种绝对的热情，确保事情得到妥善处理，确保电梯尽快恢复运行。有时他们甚至做得有点过头，我会说：“伙计们，这本来是可以收费的。我知道你们想尽快完成，但你们至少可以为我们记录下来，以便我们也能记录下来。”但这就是您再次获得这些绝妙想法的地方，比如“如果我们把这样的东西放在井道里，我们就能确保安全”，或者“如果我们在这里安装摄像头，或者在这里安装传感器，这会有帮助”。

<p class="english-text">absolutely how do you deal with that uh most days very well not always I'll be honest um you know I think it's important are they often right oh yeah they're closer to it they're closer to it. Um, and and you know, it's I kind of think that if you have if you decide everything, the company can never be better than you. Yeah. If you have the combination of all types of opinions, you could create incredible things. Yeah. It's amazing. And um I I have a a very easy email and a mobile number that that most people have, whether they're inside the company or outside. I get customer complaints directly to me. I read all my own emails. I don't nobody nobody filters anything. It doesn't go to another box. Um I think it's important to understand what's happening. Um but uh I think you know culture matters and in our case there's this I called it humble pride but there's this this this absolute zealousness to make sure um especially with our mechanics that things are are put back right that that the elevators back in operation as quick as possible. And sometimes they they do this um almost to an extreme where I'm like that would be billable guys. I know I know you want to get can you can you at least record this for us so that we can we can capture it as well. Um but but that's where you again you just get these incredible ideas on well you know if we if we put something like this in the pit you know then then we can we can make sure or if we put a camera here or if we did or put a sensor here you know this this would help</p>

### 首席执行官的角色与乐观主义

首席执行官的角色是什么？我认为最重要的两个角色是制定战略。这至关重要——愿景、使命、战略，但它绝对关乎制定战略，并确保每个人都理解它，不仅理解，而且相信并执行它。因此，在像我们这样长周期的业务中，正确制定战略非常重要。它很重要，因为这个战略可以持续数年甚至数十年。风险管理是一个关键因素，而今天这些企业风险较少是技术性的，较少是运营性的，更多是关于人，以及您必须处理的、您可能根本无法控制的因素。最后，我认为，就我而言，它确实是关于抓住核心，即以客户为中心。推动这种运营纪律，而不是我参与其中，而是灌输这种重要性，让每个人每天都明白什么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what uh what's the role of a CEO I think or roles roles yeah I think uh there I think the most the two most important roles in my mind are setting strategy um and that's that's pivotal um vision mission strategy but it's absolutely about setting the strategy and making sure everyone understands it and not only understands it but they believe in it and they execute it. Um so setting it correctly is really important in a long cycle business like ours. It matters because that strategy can last years and decades. Um risk management is a key factor and today that that that these enterprise risks are are are less technical uh are less operational and are more about people and then factors that you have to deal with that you may not control at all. And then I think the last is um is just in my my case I think it really is about getting to the core of of what's important customer centricity. Um driving that operational discipline without me being part of it but instilling that what matters so that everyone understands every day what's important.</p>
</details>

讲故事在这其中有多重要？哦，我认为讲故事绝对至关重要。我是一名工程师出身，但那不是您与人交谈的方式。您要尊重他们，但您必须将一切置于语境中。无论是与投资者、政府官员，还是与机械师，无论是市政厅会议，本周早些时候我来见您之前，我与我们在奥斯陆的团队会面，办公室里大约有20人。如果我每天能与20人交谈，我会告诉他们：“这就是我们的目标，这就是我们的表现，这就是我们需要做才能成长，并感谢你们。”你知道，有时您是讲故事的人，有时您是啦啦队长。因为我认为首席执行官需要是乐观主义者。我是一个乐观主义者，因为您比其他人更能看到公司的全貌和商业世界的全貌。如果您能综合这些信息，并讲述这个故事，无论是关于大趋势，关于我们的发展方向，关于我们的表现，还是仅仅为了表彰您的团队，这都很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is storytelling in this? Oh I think storytelling is absolutely critical. I uh you know I'm an engineer by background but that's not how you talk to people. uh you talk to them with respect but you have to context everything and it's that context whether it's with investors whether it's with government officials whether it's with the mechanics whether it's a town hall I I I came before before I came to see you earlier this week I met with our team here in Oslo about 20 people in the office and if I could get to 20 people every day I would to tell them you know here's what we're about here's how we're doing and here's here's what we need to do to grow and to thank you know, there's there's your storyteller some days, your cheerleader some days. Um, because I think the CEO needs to be the optimist. Um, and I I am an optimist because you get to see more of the company and more of of the business world than anyone else. And if you can synthesize that and tell that story about whether it's the mega trends, whether it's where we're going, whether it's how we're performing, or to just recognize your teams, it matters.</p>
</details>

请告诉我乐观主义的重要性。我的意思是，难道指出不好的事情不重要吗？哦，是的。不好的事情很容易。我的意思是，作为任何一位领导者，不仅仅是首席执行官，任何听众，大多数时候您都在处理例外情况，对吗？大多数领导者都不是在处理日常事务。您要么处理事情进展顺利的顶端，要么处理事情进展不顺利的底端。所以，您每天来上班，忘记那80%的事情。您甚至不处理中间那80%，对吗？那是流程负责的。那是纪律负责的。那是您下面的组织负责的。您处理的是顶端和底端。我认为太多人专注于日常问题。太多人专注于“哦，我们遇到了这个问题”。所以您要解决问题。您需要退后一步，看看那顶端10%。不仅仅是那10%的人，而是哪些事情进展顺利。您必须描绘出这幅画面。这是一幅真实的画面。它不像蒙克。您必须描绘出可能性的画面，因为如果您是一位优秀的领导者，您就会有追随者，人们会信任您。但您必须建立这种信任，Nicolai。这需要时间和证明。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tell me about the importance of being an optimist. I mean, don't you think it's important to point out uh the bad stuff? And Oh, yeah. Bad stuff's easy. I mean, you know, as as any leader, not just a CEO, but anybody listening to this, you know, most days you're dealing with exceptions, right? Most people aren't dealing with routine as a leader. You're dealing with with either the top end of things going right or the bottom end of things going wrong. So, so you come in every day and you forget about that 80%. You don't even deal with the 80% in the middle, right? That's what process takes care of. That's what discipline takes care of. That's what organizations below you take care of. You're dealing with the top and the bottom. Um I think too many people focus on on the problems of the day. Too many pe which they're real. Too many people focus on on you know oh we had this issue. So you're going to do issue resolution. Um you need to pull back and look at that top 10 too. It's not just the top 10% of the people but what's going right. And you have to paint the picture. And it's it's a valid picture. It's not like monk. You have to paint that picture of what's possible because if you're a good leader, you have followership and people will trust you. But you have to build that trust, Nikolai. And that takes time and takes proof.</p>

### 鼓励女性领导者与个人反思

您是工业公司中少数几位女性领导者之一。您如何鼓励更多女性进入这些传统上由男性主导的领域？或者这不重要吗？我认为如果您是一位优秀的领导者，性别并不重要。我已经在工业界工作了41年，现在差不多42年了，我一直都在男性主导的行业中。所以，对我来说，这只是我的常态。我不认为我经历的事情与零售、消费品或电信行业有什么不同。这里有需要解决的问题，有需要领导的业务，我非常鼓励女性。我们很早就通过**STEM**（Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: 科学、技术、工程和数学）项目，通过我们的“Made to Move Communities”社会项目，在学校早期就推动这一点。我会告诉所有人，无论是女孩还是男孩，都要坚持学习数学和科学。我的意思是，在10到12岁的时候，您就可以通过放弃数学和科学路径，将自己排除在整个未来的职业道路之外，无论是STEM还是其他领域。所以，我鼓励每个人都这样做。我确实关心女性拥有机会。她们需要表现，但她们可以做到。我不明白为什么有些公司或其他组织不想接触世界一半的人才。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, you're among a small handful of female leaders in industrial companies. um how can you encourage more women to go into these traditionally maledominated areas or does it not matter? I you know I I don't think it matters if you're a good leader. Um I I've been 41 years almost 42 now almost 41 in industry. Um and I've always been in male-dominated industries. So uh to me this is just my normal. Um I don't think I've experienced things different than you know if you're in if you're in retail or consumer package goods or telco. Um this is there are problems to be solved. There are businesses to be led and I would highly encourage women. I mean we start very early in with STEM programs with our made to move communities um social program uh to drive this earlier in school. I would tell anyone, girl, boy, stay in math and science. I mean, you know, it's the only career you you can actually at at 10 to 12 years old, take yourself off an entire future career path, whether it be in STEM or something else, by just getting off the math and science path. Um, so I encourage everyone to do that. Um, I do care about women uh having opportunities. Um, and they need to perform, but but they can. And I don't understand how some companies or or other organizations would not want access to half the world's talent.</p>

哦，您听起来像我丈夫。您接下来要做什么，Judy？嗯，这是一个很好的问题。我一直认为我喜欢分享我所学到的东西。对我来说，**指导**（Mentoring: 指导和支持他人职业发展）和**教练**（Coaching: 帮助他人提升技能和表现）很重要。所以，某种形式的这种工作，无论是教学，我想我会喜欢。您会是一位很棒的老师。我相信您可以在任何商学院任教。我们会看看。但现在，我不会考虑那个。我真正考虑的是我们能把公司带到哪里。这与我无关。这是一个标志性品牌，Nicolai，我们真的想把它打造成一家标志性公司。对我来说，这其中有一种细微的差别，在于我们如何表现，我们每天如何出现。但，我不仅仅是一个乐观主义者。当我查看所有数据时，我们面前有巨大的增长空间。我的意思是，拥有我们所拥有的**有机增长机会**（Organic Opportunities: 通过内部资源和现有业务增长的机会）几乎是一种奢侈，而不是需要通过**无机增长**（Inorganically: 通过并购等外部方式实现增长）来分散注意力，或者进入相邻市场。

So, some form of that, whether it's teaching, uh, I think I would love Well, you'd be a great teacher. I'm sure you can teach at whatever business school you want. Uh, we'll see. Um, but but right now, you know, I I uh I I'm not I don't think about that. I think about really where where we can take the company. And it's not about me. It's it's it's an iconic brand, Nikolai, that that we really want to make an iconic company. And to me, those are, you know, there's a nuance there in terms of how we perform, how we show up every day. But, um, I I it's more than being an optimist. As I look at all the data, we have so much room in front of us to grow. I I mean I it's almost a luxury to have the organic opportunities we have versus needing to get distracted inorganic versus needing to go into adjacent markets.</p>

您的内在驱动力是什么？是什么驱使着您？哇。我非常争强好胜。我非常没有耐心。希望这些特质随着时间的推移有所软化，但并没有消失。您想向世界展示什么样的人？如果真是这样，我不知道。你知道，只是向世界展示。是的。有所作为。是的。有所作为。这很个人化。非常个人化。我非常关心，当我们表现不如预期时，我是第一个承认的。每个季度，在财报发布后的第二天，我都会与我们前500名领导者交谈。上个季度我们确实有些地方做得不够好。这么说吧。它会得到解决。但我是第一个对他们说：“你知道，我承担责任。”

绝对如此。您如何放松？我不太擅长放松。而且也没有太多时间。您读什么书？我读，我尝试读关于领导力的书。我尝试读关于学习的书，因为我们都需要学习。如果您面前坐着一位首席执行官，他认为自己不再需要学习，那么我会告诉您，他会变得停滞不前。在当今世界，有太多东西需要学习。我现在正在读一本叫做《**激进不确定性**》（Radical Uncertainty: 指无法通过概率模型预测的极端不确定性）的书。你知道，我以前可能不会读这本书。我开玩笑说，前几天我们在一起，我对纳斯达克首席执行官**Adena Friedman**说：“我以为我们作为首席执行官只会经历一次黑天鹅事件。”所以，这些是有趣的时代，但也是充满机遇的时代。这本书更侧重于哪些不确定性可以预测，哪些不能。作为首席执行官，我们经常谈论控制我们能控制的。我绝对相信这一点，问题在于定义我们能控制什么，我试图从这本书中得到的是，我是否能控制更多我只是没有想到的东西？
