### 犯罪恐惧心理

**史蒂夫**: 史蒂夫，我先请教你。我们刚才听了民意调查员沙奇·库尔关于加拿大人对犯罪日益增长的恐惧。我想从心理学家的角度问，加拿大人对犯罪感到恐惧是否合理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Steve, I'm going to start with you. We just heard from pollster Shachi Kurl on Canadians fear growing fear of crime. And I'm wondering, from a psychologist point of view, whether it makes sense for Canadians to be afraid of crime.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 是的，我认为我们现在看到的也是我们所有人从各方面感受到的威胁的一种内化，对吧？我们有环境方面的问题，有地缘政治方面的问题。我们的大脑会本能地对威胁做出反应。事实上，它有一些特殊的系统就是为了寻找威胁并让我们做好准备。而这些系统现在前所未有地被激活。我们承受着一种慢性压力。当这种情况发生时，像犯罪这样的事情，虽然一直被视为威胁，但可能被感知得比平时更具威胁性，发生的可能性也更大。所以我认为环境因素确实加剧了我们目前的这种感知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Yeah, I think what we're seeing also is a very much an internalization of all the threat we're all feeling from all sides now, right? We've got the environmental stuff, we've got geopolitical stuff. Our our brain just sort of reacts to threat. In fact, it's it's got special systems just to look for threat and to get us ready for it. And those systems are kind of engaged like never before now. And we have this sort of chronic stress. And when that happens, you know, things like crime which would always be perceived as as threatening but probably are perceived as more threatening, more likely to happen than they typically would. So I think the environment is really contributing to this perception we're having.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，正如我们在上一段中了解到的，数据显示过去一年犯罪率有所下降。那么，为什么这似乎没有引起人们的共鸣呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Jennifer, as we learned in our last segment, the stats show crime has come down a bit in the last year. So why doesn't that seem to resonate with people?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 我认为是因为它无时无刻不在社交媒体上充斥着我们的视野。过去，我们只会在新闻发生时才看到，通常是在晚间新闻里，而现在我们随时随地都能在指尖看到它，所以人们觉得它一直都在，他们看到它发生，并且他们几乎会与同样经历这些事情的个体产生共鸣，这进而导致了他们生活中恐惧感的增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: I think because it's in our faces all the time in social media. Back in the day, we only saw news when it happened on the hour, usually in the evening news, and now we see it at our fingertips whenever we want, so people feel like it's always there and they see it happening, and they almost resonate with the individuals who are also experiencing it, which then causes that increased feel of fear in their lives.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 是的。如果我没记错的话，社交媒体的设计就是为了吸引眼球。我们会被可怕的事物所吸引。所以，不仅仅是我们都在从社交媒体获取新闻。社交媒体本身就存在一种偏见，倾向于向我们呈现这些可怕的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Yeah. And if I may just add to that quickly to the design of social media is to grab eyeballs. And we are attracted to things that are scary. And so it's not just that we're all getting our news from social media. There's a bias in social media to present this scary stuff to us.

</details>

### 个人犯罪的冲击

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，我想问一下，就我们看到的犯罪类型而言，我希望你能回忆一下你在一线工作时的经历。我们看到的以及在社交媒体上看到的、在晚上六点新闻里看到的这些犯罪类型，感觉它们更具个人性质，你知道，更贴近我们的生活，比如入室盗窃，这些是否也引起了共鸣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Jennifer, I do want to ask, you know, in terms of the types of crimes that we're seeing, and I'm hoping you can maybe go back to, you know, your time on the front lines as well. But the types of crimes that we're seeing and that we're seeing on social media that we're seeing, you know, on our 6:00 news, it feels like it's more personal that, you know, these are much closer to home when we see home invasions, when we're seeing, you know, carjackings, does any of that resonate as well?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 我会说是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: I would say yes.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 被闯入的恐惧感对人们来说更大，尤其是在它发生的时候。比如在阿尔伯塔的农村地区，财产犯罪实际上正在增加。当一个人经历财产犯罪时，他们会感到被侵犯，然后在自己的家中感到恐惧，而他们本应感到安全。我知道作为一名警察，我们曾遇到过很多毒品犯罪、精神健康问题。我和我的同事正在进行一项关于警察在日益增长的毒品犯罪和无家可归问题中的经历的研究，他们发现警察正在以更高的比例经历这些，而且人们变得越来越暴力。其中很多实际上是陌生人犯罪，尽管它不像已知的犯罪那样普遍，但它仍然会引起人们的恐惧感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: And the fear of being broken into is greater for people, especially when it's happening. What, like in rural Alberta, it is actually on the increase property crime. And when an individual experiences property crime, they feel violated and then they feel fearful in their own home when they're supposed to feel safe. And I know as a police officer, we encountered a lot of drug crime, mental health. And my colleague and I are actually doing a study on police officers experiences with the increased drug crimes and homelessness, and they're finding that police officers are experiencing that at a greater rate, and people are becoming more violent. And a lot of it is actually happening with stranger crime, even though it's not as prevalent as known crime, it still creates that sense of fear in people.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，我想接着你刚才说的，当我们想到犯罪时，通常会与大城市联系起来。但正如你提到的，你正在进行的项目以及你想要了解的农村地区，那里的居民是否和城市居民一样害怕犯罪？比如，你所在的阿尔伯塔农村地区，与埃德蒙顿或卡尔加里相比，人们的恐惧程度如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Jennifer, I want to stick with you when you talk about sort of the rural when we think of crime, it's often associated with big cities. But as you mentioned, the project that you're working on and sort of want to get a sense of rural areas, are people just as fearful of crime living in where you are, say, in rural Alberta versus, say, Edmonton or Calgary?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 绝对是。我实际上是这里阿尔伯塔农村地区警察委员会的主席。财产犯罪确实在增加。皇家骑警（RCMP）也注意到了这一点。有趣的是，从2023年开始，他们看到了暴力犯罪的增加。其中很多与家庭暴力有关。所以施暴者是受害者认识的人。但很多毒品问题正在向阿尔伯塔农村地区蔓延，从城市地区转移过来，他们正在闯入人们的家中，这导致了恐惧感的增加。而且由于皇家骑警（RCMP）经常需要15到20分钟甚至数小时才能赶到，人们担心如果他们在闯入者行动时被抓到，将无法得到及时救援。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Absolutely. And I actually am the chair of the police committee in rural Alberta here. And there is an increase in property crime. And the RCMP have noted that. And interestingly, starting in 2023, they've seen an increase in violent crime. A lot of it is associated with domestic violence. So the offenders are known to the victim. But a lot of the drug issues are moving to rural Alberta, which from the urban areas and they're breaking into people's homes, which is creating an increased fear. And because the RCMP are often 15, 20 minutes, hours away from helping somebody, there is that fear that they're not going to be able to be saved if they catch an intruder in the action.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 史蒂夫。是的，我想接着说这一点。你知道，像入室盗窃这样的个人犯罪是典型的例子，因为这不仅仅是，想象一下我们坐在那里看新闻，看到很多我们并不真正关心的事，比如另一辆卡车着火了。那些卡车司机在做什么？但这并不会让我们觉得与自己有关。而入室盗窃则不同。你知道，我们能感同身受。因此，我们更有可能记住这些故事。当我们估计事件发生的概率时，我们使用的一个工具叫做“可得性启发法”。我们能多快地回忆起该事件的例子。而这些入室盗窃的例子会很快浮现在脑海中。所以它们可能对我们如何判断事件发生的可能性产生了不成比例的影响。我们可能认为它发生的可能性比实际要大得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Yeah, and I really want to follow up upon that. You know, those personal crimes like the home invasion is the prototypical because it's not just like, imagine when we sit and watch the news, we see a bunch of things that we don't think really, you know, another tow truck is on fire and they're. And what are these tow truck people doing? But it doesn't really feel personal to us. The home invasions, do. You know, we can kind of feel that. And as a result, we're more likely to remember those stories. And when we estimate the probabilities of events, one of the things we use is something called the availability heuristic. How quickly can we bring to mind examples of that event. And these home invasions come to mind pretty quickly. So they're probably having a disproportionate impact on on how we all, you know, figure out how likely is this. And we probably think it's far more likely than it is.

</details>

### 大脑的反应机制

**史蒂夫**: 帮助我们从大脑的角度理解一下。你知道，当我们看到社交媒体上的视频，看到新闻上的视频时，我们的本能是什么？我们该怎么做？我想我们已经有很多关于如何在加拿大作为房主保护自己的法律的讨论了。你知道，当我们谈论恐惧时，有“战斗”、“逃跑”和“冻结”。请帮助我们理解一下，当我观看社交媒体上关于“砸抢”的视频时，大脑是如何工作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Help us understand a little bit in terms of the brain. You know, when we see these videos on social media, when we see these videos on the news, what what is our instinct? What are we doing? Is it I think we've had a lot of conversation of, you know, here in Canada about, you know, what laws we can do as homeowners to protect ourselves. There is this, you know, when we talk about the, you know, the fear, there's the flight, there is the freeze. Help us understand sort of how the brain is working when when I am watching a video of a smash and grab on social media.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 是的，是的。实际上，进入大脑的每一个感官信息都会经过我们称之为“杏仁核”的小东西，它是我们大脑两侧各有一个的、形状像杏仁的部分。杏仁核的工作是感知危险。它的存在是为了让我们活下来。当它检测到某些威胁时，而且这种威胁是广义的，不一定是一个拿着棒球棍的人。它可能是一种尴尬或社交上的威胁。它们会启动这种战斗、逃跑、冻结的系统。在社交媒体上，你知道，冻结并没有太多意义。逃跑。我希望有更多的人逃离社交媒体，但他们没有。那么这会留下什么呢？它让你留下。战斗。在社交媒体上，“战斗”实际上意味着分享，让人们知道，嘿，这里有危险。所以这是另一种放大。现在，让你害怕的东西，你更有可能分享。而这会让它对其他人来说更加普遍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Yeah, yeah. So really, every sensory bit of information that comes into the brain goes through these little things called the amygdala, a little almond shaped part of our brain on either side. And the amygdala's job is to sense danger. It's there to keep us alive. And when it detects something threatening and threat is in a very general sense, it doesn't have to be somebody with a baseball bat. It could be an embarrassment or social, you know, threats. They'll kick in this fight, flight freeze system in social media. You know, freeze doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Flee. I wish a lot more people were fleeing social media than they are. They're not. So what does that leave you? It leaves you. Fight and fight in social media really means to share, to kind of let people know, hey, here's this danger. And so that's another amplification. Now, something that scares you, you're more likely to share. And that's going to make it more prevalent for everybody else.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，当我们看到人们在街上吸毒，或者有人在公共场合出现精神健康问题时，这对我们的安全感有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Jennifer, when we see people doing, for example, hard drugs on the street or someone having a mental health episode in public, what does that do to our sense of safety?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 嗯，这会增加恐惧感，因为你常常会感到无助，而且由于加拿大许多城市和地区警力不足，他们觉得这种安全感并不总是唾手可得。我个人可以说，我以前在卡尔加里市中心工作时，情况不像现在这么糟。我知道当我走在卡尔加里市中心时，你会看到无家可归者，你会看到吸毒的人，比如那些神志不清的人，不管他们吸的是甲基还是别的什么。这很可怕，因为他们会变得好斗。而很多时候人们不知道如何应对这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Well, it creates a greater level of fear, because oftentimes you feel helpless, and because a lot of cities and areas across Canada are having less police officers, they feel that that safety element isn't always readily available to them. And I can personally say that I used to work downtown Calgary, and it wasn't as bad as it is now. And I know that when I'm walking in downtown Calgary, I mean, you see homeless individuals, you see drug people like people whacked out on whether it's meth or whatever it is. And it is it's frightening because they become confrontational. And a lot of times people don't know how to react in those situations.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 是的。即使他们没有变得好斗，我们的大脑自然也会害怕我们不太了解的事物。而这些人是我们不太了解的人。但同样，当我们看到街上的一些人，我们不太清楚他们是怎么变成这样的，也不太清楚他们是否危险。你知道，很多经历无家可归的人，比如，根本不危险。但因为我们不真正理解，所以大脑会感到害怕。大脑喜欢能够预测人们将如何回应以及如何行动。当我们觉得我们没有这种预测能力时，不确定他们会做什么，那么他们就会变得可怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Yeah. And even when they don't become confrontational, the brain naturally is fearful of things we don't understand very well. And those could be people's we don't understand very well. But again, when we see, you know, some of these individuals on the street and we don't quite get how they got there, and we don't really understand if they're dangerous or not. You know, a lot a lot of the people experiencing homelessness, for example, are not dangerous at all. But because we don't really understand that it's scary to the brain. The the brain likes to be able to predict how people are going to respond and how people are going to act. When we feel like we don't have that prediction, we're not sure what they're going to do, then they become scary.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 你刚才。是的。我正好想插一句我们目前正在进行的研究。很多警察说，无家可归者担心自己的生命安全，因为他们住在帐篷城里。他们住在那些让他们感到不安全的地方，而且无处可去。所以我同意史蒂夫的说法，这对那些个体来说绝对是一种威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: You were. Yeah. So I was just going to jump in with the study that we're doing right now. A lot of police officers are actually saying that the homeless population are fearful for their lives because they're they're living in tent cities. They're living in areas where they don't feel safe and they have nowhere else to go. And so that I agree with what Steve is saying is that is absolutely a threatening thing for even those individuals.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，我想接着问你。你曾是卡尔加里警察局的警官，服务了14年。你提到了警官短缺问题，增加可见的警力部署是否是解决人们恐惧的一种潜在方法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Jennifer, I want to stick with you. You were a police officer with Calgary Police Services for 14 years. You had mentioned sort of the shortage of police officers is having more visible police presence, a potential answer to addressing people's fears?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 绝对是。在卡尔加里这里，警察局长曾让我们的警长或省警务部门与卡尔加里警方合作，他们只是在卡尔加里市中心巡逻，与人们交谈，处理犯罪问题，由此产生的安全水平令人惊叹。我认为这实际上也是卡尔加里警方在市中心部署巡逻的原因，因为在高层建筑工作的人们感到不安全，所以增加地面上的可见警力，警察实际上可以给人们带来安全感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Absolutely. And in Calgary here, the chief of police actually had our sheriffs or our provincial police service partner with the Calgary police, and all they did was walk around downtown Calgary talking to people, dealing with the crime element and the level of safety that resulted in that initiative was amazing. And I think that is actually why the Calgary police put in a foot patrol in downtown Calgary, because individuals working in the high rises were feeling less safe, and so having more boots on the ground and visible, police can actually give individuals that level of safety.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 对于那些与警察关系不好的人或社区呢？詹妮弗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: What about people who have or communities rather that have a poor relationship with police? Jennifer.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 在这种情况下，我认为与这些个体进行互动和接触非常重要，也是警方的职责。我知道卡尔加里警方和皇家骑警（RCMP）也一样，他们会举办社区论坛，邀请那些可能对警方运作方式有疑问的人，特别是那些来自不同国家、与警方关系不佳的人，并努力建立这些关系，我认为这些都非常重要。我还会建议人们尝试参加“骑警随行”活动，这样他们就能看到警察日常处理的工作，并认识到这是一项艰巨的任务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: In that case, I think it's important and incumbent on the police to interact and engage with those individuals. And I know that the Calgary police and the RCMP as well, they hold community forums which invite individuals that maybe have questions about how the police function if they come from a different country, where the relationship with the police is not a good one, and trying to build those relationships, and I think those are very important. And I would also suggest that people try and do ride alongs so they can see what police actually deal with on a day to day basis and see that it is a difficult job.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 詹妮弗，我想象一下，即使在多伦多，对于那些乘坐公共交通的人来说，看到身穿制服的人可能会让他们感到安心。我想知道，你认为增加警力是解决办法吗？还是我们需要解决一些问题的根源？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Steve, I imagine for some people, even here in Toronto, for people who take transit, for example, seeing someone in uniform might help them, give them a sense of safety. And I'm just wondering, do you think a greater police presence is the answer, or do we need to address perhaps the root cause of some of these issues?

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 我认为，就感知而言，这可能很棘手。显然，我们希望解决根源问题。我们希望努力减少犯罪。但肯定的是，有警察在周围，特别是像詹妮弗建议的那样，如果你感到舒适并与这些警察有联系，如果他们有那种社区警务的氛围，这对我们来说是这样的：如果我们正在地铁上，而那里有一些我们不太确定的角色，我们又开始有点害怕，因为我们不知道他们会怎么做。你知道，如果附近有警察，我知道这听起来有点糟糕，但社会就是这样运作的。这是他们的问题，对吧？如果那个人开始出现什么情况，我就不必做什么了。要么逃跑，要么实际地，你知道，介入。天知道我们有多少人会担心这样做。所以要知道，嘿，那是他们的工作。当事情开始出错时，他们会介入。这意味着我不必。这是一种巨大的安慰。而这正是我们每天依赖警察的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: I mean, when it comes to perceptions, it can be tricky. Obviously we want to be after the root causes. We want to try to reduce crime. But but certainly having police officers around, especially as Jennifer suggests, if you feel comfortable and connected to those officers, if they have that community policing kind of vibe, what that does for us is if we're on the subway and there's some characters that we're a little unsure of again, and we're getting a little scared because we don't know how they're going to act. You know, if there's an officer nearby, we know this is going to sound kind of nasty, but this is how society works. It's their problem, right? If that person starts to get whatever, I don't have to do something about it. Either escape or actually, you know, step in. God forbid many of us would be worried about doing that. So to know, hey, that's their job. When when things start to go wrong, they're going to step in. And that means I don't have to. That's that's a huge level of comfort. And it's what we rely on on officers for every day.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 我现在不得不问这个问题了，詹妮弗，你显然不能代表任何警察部门说话，特别是多伦多警察局，该部门在2024年入室盗窃案高发时受到了很多关注。我不知道你是否听说了这个故事，但有一位警官曾建议居民将车钥匙放在门前，以避免与窃贼发生冲突。信息传递在这种情况下扮演着怎样的角色？因为，你知道，对于许多听到这个消息的居民来说，就像史蒂夫说的，看到警察可能会让他们觉得，嗯，那不是我的问题了。是他们的问题。但如果警察在某些情况下推卸责任，那么安全感和对安全的感知就会受到侵蚀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: I do have to ask this question now, Jennifer, you don't obviously speak for any police service right now, specifically the Toronto Police Service, which is one service that got a lot of attention in 2024 when this was at the height of home invasions. I don't know if you had heard the story, but there was a police officer that had suggested that residents leave their car keys at the front of the door to avoid confrontation with thieves. How does messaging sort of play into this? Because one, you know, for for a lot of residents who heard that message, just like Steve said, seeing a police officer might be okay, well, that's now not my problem. It's their problem. But if police are perhaps passing the puck in certain situations, that that safety and that that perception of safety has eroded.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 我很高兴你提到了这一点。我非常清楚那件事。在我那些仍然是警察的朋友中，我们讨论过这件事。我不同意那种想法。你应该考虑安装摄像头，因为摄像头不仅让你感觉更安全，还能帮助警察确定谁可能闯入或试图闯入他们的住所。在我看来，提供安全建议比说“把你的钥匙放在门前”要好，这就像说“把你的门锁打开，然后说，随便进来拿你想要的东西，你就没事了”。我认为这会在公众中造成一种敌意，当他们看到警察似乎在推卸责任时，就像“这不是我们的问题，让他们拿走他们需要的东西，然后继续你的生活”。但就像史蒂夫说的，也像我提到的，当有人闯入你的家时，这是对你个人空间的侵犯，这会造成长期的创伤和恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: And I'm actually glad you brought that up. I'm well aware of that incident. And among my friends who continue to be police officers, we've discussed that. I disagree with that form of idea. You instead, they should be looking at things like, okay, installing cameras because cameras not only make you feel safer, they help the police determine who may be broke in or is trying to break into their place. Giving them ideas for safety would be a better idea, in my view, than saying, leave your key fob at the front door like it's a kin to saying just leave your door unlocked, right? And say, pretty much, come in and take what you want and you're good. And I think that creates this animosity amongst the public when they see the police are almost passing the buck, like it's not our problem, just let them take what they need and then get on with your life. But like Steve said, and I alluded to, when someone breaks into your home, that's a violation of your personal space, and that creates a level of trauma and fear for a long time after all.

</details>

### 应对焦虑

**史蒂夫**: 好的。我们还有不到一分钟的时间，我想了解一下，如果人们对社区的犯罪感到焦虑，他们应该如何应对？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: Right. We have about just under a minute or so, and I want to get a sense if people are feeling anxious about crime in their communities, how should they try to navigate around them?

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 我认为，总的来说，信息很重要。詹妮弗建议参加“骑警随行”。我不知道，我们中的任何人都可以参加“骑警随行”吗？如果可以的话，这很酷，但我想，你知道，了解警察正在做出的努力，以及你和你的邻居，你知道，你可以。我们想到旧的邻里守望计划之类的事情。但字面上说，这种社交联系带来了很多安全感，甚至来自于联系你的邻居，并说，你知道，嘿，这里有点问题。我们能一起努力，关注社区，如果有什么不对劲就互相告知吗？你知道，我觉得这是一种社区努力，可以帮助你感到更安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: I mean, generally, information is great. Jennifer suggested going a ride along. I don't know, can any of us just go on a ride along? It's kind of cool if we can, but but I think, you know, getting a sense of the efforts that the police are making and how you and potentially your neighborhood, you know, you can. We think of old neighborhood watch programs and things like that. But but literally there's a lot of security in that social connection that even comes from reaching out to your neighbours and saying, you know, hey, there's a bit of an issue here. Can can we work together and have eyes on the neighborhood and let each other know if anything seems up? You know, feeling like that's that's part of a community effort I think can help you feel a lot more secure.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 詹妮弗，我还要补充一点，教育自己了解法院系统和个人如何被释放，理解这个过程，理解警察如何运作。就像我之前说的，看到他们如何工作可以大大有助于让社会感觉更安全，因为他们看到了正在遵循和完成的程序。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer**: Jennifer I would also adding on to that, educating yourself about the court systems and how individuals are released, understanding that process, understanding how police function. And like I go back to seeing how they do their job can go a long way and making society feel safer because they see there actually is processes that are being followed and done.

</details>

**史蒂夫**: 我们就先谈到这里。詹妮弗。史蒂夫，非常感谢你在这件事上的见解。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve**: We're going to have to leave it there. Jennifer. Steve, really appreciate your insights on this one. Thank you so much.

</details>

**詹妮弗**: 谢谢你，谢谢。

**Jennifer**: Thank you, thank you.
