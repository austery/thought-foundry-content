### 精彩片段集锦：数学研究范式的重塑与 AI 的介入

**数学家 / 研究员**：作为一名一线数学家，你常常会产生某个想法，觉得它或许可行；接着你会尝试几个小时、几天甚至几个星期，但到了某个节点你往往就放弃了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mathematician / Researcher**: Often as a practicing mathematician you have an idea and then you kind of think it might work, then you try for a few hours, a few weeks, and at some point you give up.

</details>

**主持人 / 对话者**：而对于 GPT 来说，它的逻辑则是：“好吧，人类让我做这个，那我们就全力去把它推导出来。”正因如此，我们现在正处于一个“可触及数学成果”全面复兴的阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host / Interlocutor**: Whereas for GPT, like, okay, a human told me to do this, let's just do this. And so that's why we're sort of in this renaissance of like reachable results.

</details>

**数学家 / 研究员**：这个课题最精彩的地方，在于当下确实没有人真正清楚其中的全貌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mathematician / Researcher**: This is the best part about this problem, which is really nobody has any idea.

</details>

**主持人 / 对话者**：模型到底是在以某种不可思议的方式进行盲猜吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host / Interlocutor**: Is the model just guessing in some insane way?

</details>

**数学家 / 研究员**：到目前为止，它似乎还没有展现出明显的上限，但它目前确实还没有掌握全部的背景上下文。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mathematician / Researcher**: It doesn't seem like there's a limit so far, but it doesn't have that context yet.

</details>

**主持人 / 对话者**：如果应用数学的发展步伐能够大幅加快，对整个世界来说都将是一件幸事。数学问题的难度上限是极高的。即使 AI 在数学能力上继续保持指数级的跃升，它在很大程度上也可能永远无法解决像 P 与 NP 猜想（P vs NP）这样的终极难题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host / Interlocutor**: It'd be nice for the world if applied mathematics went a lot faster. The ceiling for difficulty of a math problem is pretty high. Even if AI continues getting like exponentially better at math, plausible will never solve something like P versus NP.

</details>

**主持人 / 对话者**：数学界接纳并吸收这一工具的理想方式应该是什么样的？可能现阶段绝大多数数学家都已经意识到：好吧，AI 显然正在做出一些非常扎实、非平凡（non-trivial）的成果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host / Interlocutor**: What's the ideal way that this is being taken up by the math community? Probably most at this point are like, okay, AI is obviously doing some non-trivial stuff.

</details>

### 从纯数学研究到加入 OpenAI：初识前沿大模型的震撼时刻

**主持人**：非常感谢两位今天能来。这真的令人极其兴奋，因为我认为数学在 AI 的推动下正以不可思议的速度飞速演进。我非常希望能与两位兼具一线数学家背景并在 OpenAI 工作的专家深入聊聊其中的一些最新成果。今天来到现场的是 Mark Sellke 和 Mahtab Sawhney。说起来我们之间其实颇有渊源，因为赵宇飞（Yufei Zhao）老师曾是你们两位的导师。与我十多年前就离开数学界不同，你们两位在数学领域的钻研要深厚得多。因此，能听你们系统分享 OpenAI 是如何切入这一领域的，以及在 AI 带来极其迅猛助力的当下，你们认为数学研究将走向何方，是一件非常令人激动的事。或许我们可以先从一些非常基础的问题聊起：在可以公开分享的范围内，你们目前具体从事什么工作？你们又是如何从一线纯数学研究者转型加入 OpenAI 的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, thank you guys for coming. This is really exciting because I think math has been moving so fast with AI. I'd just love to, you know, get to both practicing mathematicians and who work at OpenAI to chat on some of these results. So, you know, we have with us Mark Sellke and Mahtab Sawhney. We're connected actually because Yufei was actually your adviser. And so both of you guys have worked much more deeply in math since I've quit over a decade ago. And so this is very exciting to kind of hear a download of your thoughts on how OpenAI has been sort of approaching this and also just like where you think math is going with the incredibly rapid advance of how AI has been helping. So yeah, I don't know, maybe we can start off with some very basic questions of like what do you do to the extent that you can of course share, and how did you come from being a practicing mathematician to working at OpenAI?

</details>

**Mark Sellke / Mahtab Sawhney**：我想我们俩大体上都是在去年模型在数学推理能力上真正开始突飞猛进时感到无比兴奋的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Sellke / Mahtab Sawhney**: Yeah, I mean I guess we both broadly got excited last year when the model started to really take off in math.

</details>

**Mahtab Sawhney**：是的。我加入的时间比 Mark 稍晚一点。具体来说，我是在去年夏天看到了国际数学奥林匹克竞赛（IMO）的金牌水平表现，当时我的第一反应就是：这太不可思议了，我一定要搞清楚他们到底是怎么做到的，必须亲自去探个究竟。随后到了秋天，Mark 给了我一个 GPT-5（内部前沿推理模型）的测试账号。接着我便开始亲自测试并上手摆弄这些模型，随后极其迅速地确信了一点：与这些前沿模型一起工作和探索，体验确实非同凡响、令人极其振奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mahtab Sawhney**: Yeah. Um, so I joined a little bit before... I saw the IMO gold medal last summer basically and I thought, you know, this is amazing. I want to see what the heck they did. Let me go see. And then yeah, I guess in the fall Mark gave me a GPT-5 account and then I started playing with models and very quickly became convinced that yeah, it was extremely exciting to play with them. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**：在那之前你们两位就已经在合作了对吧？你们彼此已经相识很久了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You two were collaborating before this. Yeah, you've known each other for a while.

</details>

**Mark Sellke / Mahtab Sawhney**：是的，我们实际上还共同合著发表过一篇论文。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Sellke / Mahtab Sawhney**: Yeah, we had like one paper we actually wrote jointly.

</details>

**主持人**：所以说，GPT-5 就是促使你彻底转变观念的转折点。当时吸引你的神奇之处究竟是什么？你在测试时抛给了它怎样的问题？整个探索过程是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So, GPT-5 was your conversion. What was the magic that sort of, I don't know, as you're doing, like what question do you throw at it? What process?

</details>

### 突破文献迷雾：大模型在保罗·埃尔德什猜想库中的惊人检索与推演能力

**Mahtab Sawhney**：是的。我认为整件事情的开端——至少对我个人的顿悟时刻来说——是这样的：数学界有一个著名的未解问题集合。保罗·埃尔德什（Paul Erdős）是一位极其著名的数学家，他生前提出过海量的数学猜想与公开问题。如今这些问题都被整理并收录在了一个专门的网站数据库中。我个人的研究方向正是组合数学（Combinatorics），而埃尔德什提出的许多问题恰恰是该领域中最核心、最关键的基石问题。因此，平时在那个网站上浏览翻阅这些问题本身就是一件很有乐趣的事。

然而，过去常常发生一件让我感到极其沮丧的事情：我看到某个问题被标记为“公开未解（Open）”，但实际上我无法确切知道这个状态是否准确，因为数学文献浩如烟海且极其分散，要彻底检索清楚它是否其实已经被某人攻克往往非常困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mahtab Sawhney**: Yeah. So, I think how this started was, at least for me, the starting moment was something like: there's a collection of problems called... so Paul Erdős is a very famous mathematician, posed a bunch of problems, and so they've now all been collected on this site. And so I specifically worked in combinatorics, and a lot of these questions are among the most important. So it's always fun to flick through the site, but one thing that often happened to me that was extremely frustrating was I would look at a question, see that it's marked as open, and then not actually know if it's correct, not actually know if it was still unsolved because the literature is often quite hard to search.

</details>

**主持人**：确实如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Mahtab Sawhney**：在当时的一个具体案例中，我直接把那个问题输入到了 GPT-5 中。大概仅仅过了五分钟，模型就成功找到了一篇极其精准的相关参考文献。更巧的是，当时我的几位朋友正好也在关注并思考网站上的那个特定问题。我和他们交流讨论过，我们之前已经花了好几个小时去推演，但始终无法判断这个问题究竟是不是现有技术手段能够触及的。

因此，当模型明确告诉你：“是的，这个问题在现有工具的解决范围内，具体的证明思路和解决步骤如下”，并且把路径清晰摆在你面前时，那种感觉真的太美妙了。这正是 GPT-5 呈现给我的结果。随后我立刻把这件事告诉了 Mark，对我而言，这确实是一个极度令人震撼的瞬间。随后我们顺着这个方向进行了更深入的挖掘，在当时一口气找到了十多个类似的成功案例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mahtab Sawhney**: And in one instance I just plugged it into GPT-5, and like five minutes later it found a reference. And this was a case where a few of my friends had actually started thinking about the problem on the site. I was talking with them, and I mean we had spent a few hours, wasn't clear if the problem was within reach. And it was just very nice, okay, to be told: yes, this is in reach, here's how you do it. And yeah, GPT-5 told me this, and then I told Mark about this, and this for me was quite a surprising moment. Yeah. And then we looked more into it and we found like 10 more cases sort of like this at the time.

### 从广博联想到精密执行：AI 解决数学难题的双重相对优势

**主持人**：感觉在广泛的领域之间建立跨学科连接，或者像你刚才提到的那样，去大海捞针般检索历史上是否已有相关前置成果，对人类的大脑来说确实是极其繁重耗时的工作，但对机器来说或许正是天然的强项。但我猜想，随着过去一年的飞速进展，最令人印象深刻的突破已经远远超出了单纯的“文献检索与关联”范畴。无论我们是从更抽象的角度来讨论，还是结合最近通过 Astra 项目等公布的具体数学成果来剖析，你们能否为我详细阐述一下：最近的进展是如何超越单纯的跨领域搜索与知识连接，真正展现出类似于职业数学家那种更深层、更严密的数学推理能力的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I feel like, you know, being better at maybe making connections between wide [fields] or even just like, as you're saying, the search for whether there's been a result or a related thing earlier is just kind of humanly hard, but maybe better for machine. But I imagine as the progress has happened in the last year, what has been impressive has kind of reached beyond that. And maybe through talking about it more abstractly, or if it's more natural to talk about it through like one of the problems that has been recently announced through, you know, Astra, you can kind of enlighten me as to how the recent progress has been a lot more than just searching through more areas, making these connections between the field, and perhaps just actually deeper, more mathematical reasoning that's similar to a working mathematician.

</details>

**Mark Sellke**：是的。我认为你刚才提到的“广博搜索与无所不知”这一点，目前依然绝对是 AI 极其显著的相对优势之一，并且这在很大程度上决定了 AI 当前能够率先攻克的数学问题类型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Sellke**: Yeah. I mean, I think this search point of being familiar with everything is still definitely like a relative strength that maybe informs the types of problems that AI is solving now.

</details>

**Mark Sellke**：除此之外，我认为模型还展现出了其他几项非常鲜明的相对优势与劣势。其中另一个极其突出的相对优势在于：一旦模型锁定了某个核心想法，它在执行具体技术推导方面的能力极其强悍。

每当数学家产生一个构想时，通常都需要完成大量的技术铺垫与严密对齐——比如你需要反复确认 $\epsilon$ 是否严格小于 $\delta$ 之类的分析细节，你必须确保每一个不等式和边界条件都分毫不差。对于人类研究者而言，在这些极其繁复琐碎的技术细节中迷失方向是常有的事；但在我的实际观察中，AI 在推导和攻克这类繁复论证时，几乎总能以惊人的准确率完美搞定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Sellke**: Um, I think there are some other relative strengths and weaknesses. Another relative strength that's pretty noticeable is just like it's very good at executing on some idea once it has it. Whenever you have an idea, there's usually some amount of getting everything lined up, like is epsilon smaller than delta, this kind of thing, you have to get everything correct. And like for a human, it's easy to get lost in these kinds of details, and the AIs just kind of always nail these kinds of arguments, I find.

### 单位距离猜想与算力博弈：突破人类心理与时间的收益瓶颈

**主持人**：确实如此。关于这一点你们肯定了解得比我更深入，但比如在单位距离猜想（Unit Distance Problem）这类问题中，尽管核心方案中确实包含了 OpenAI 的独创性贡献，但其宏观的切入思路可能早在埃尔德什最初提出时就已经有所探讨。然而，将这种思路付诸完整、严谨的数学推演，本身就是一项极其宏大艰巨的技术壮举。

对于人类数学家而言，每个人的精力和时间都是极其有限的。如果在进行了许多步深入推演之后前景依然不明朗——除非你是像安德鲁·怀尔斯（Andrew Wiles）那样能够隐姓埋名、独自闭关十年去攻克费马大定理——否则在面对不确定性时，继续死磕的风险回报比（risk-reward）就显得很不划算。但对于 GPT 来说，它的逻辑就变成了：“既然人类指令让我探索这个方向，那我就毫不犹豫地一推到底。”这也正是我们当下迎来可触及数学成果全面爆发的原因。这种观察符合实际情况吗？在 Astra 所取得的一系列成果中，主要体现的也是这种能力优势，还是说其中还蕴含了其他的额外要素或突破性机制？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Is it usually just... I mean I feel like you guys will know more detail on this, but like for the unit distance problem, the approach there was definitely contributions from OpenAI, but like the approach perhaps was suggested even originally by Erdős, and then it's just that the actual reasoning was a very momentous feat. And so for a human, you're like: well, I only have a limited amount of time, and if after so many steps it is still not clear... I mean maybe you're like Andrew Wiles and you actually spend 10 years alone and do something, but if it's not clear, then it doesn't become... like the risk-reward is not good enough. Whereas for GPT, like okay, a human told me to do this, let's just do this. And so that's why we're sort of in this renaissance of like reachable results. Does that track? And did you feel like with the Astra results, is that sort of like where the strengths have been primarily, or there's an extra ingredient or magic here?

</details>

**Mahtab Sawhney / Mark Sellke**：我认为单位距离问题的例子非常具有启发性。就具体的数学构造而言，你完全可以认为它与前人曾经尝试过的构造形式非常相似。

但在实际的数学研究中，经常会遇到这样的情况：作为一名一线数学家，你产生了一个灵感，觉得它有可能奏效；于是你尝试了几个小时、几天乃至几个星期，但在某个时刻你选择了放弃。随后，一种并不罕见、甚至令人颇为懊恼的经历是：在一两年之后，你发现其他人沿着你当初认为行不通的想法成功走通了证明。

因此，如何真正把一个想法推导落地、彻底做通，往往在整个攻坚战中占据了极其庞大的比重。尤其是在单位距离猜想这个案例中，充斥着海量极其苛刻、极其繁琐的技术细节。

在平时的数学研究中，你实际上无时无刻不在与问题本身进行概率博弈（gambling against the problem）。你心里会想：“也许我应该尝试这种构造方法，但这看起来成功的概率极低，根本不值得浪费我宝贵的时间。”而在这些案例中，模型凭借着将既有广博知识融会贯通的能力，以及某种极为优秀的数学品味（good taste），在多次抉择中精准下注并押中了正确的路径。你完全可以清晰地看到这种能力在实际推演中所展现出的威力……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mahtab Sawhney / Mark Sellke**: I think the unit distance example is quite telling in the sense of maybe the exact construction you can make it look very similar to what people had tried before. But often as a practicing mathematician you have an idea and then you kind of think it might work, then you try for a few hours, a few days, a few weeks, and at some point you give up. And then a not so uncommon experience is that you find out a year or two later that somebody else got the idea to work that you thought didn't work. So somehow getting an idea to work can even be a large portion of the battle. And especially in the case of the unit distance conjecture, there's just a lot of extraordinarily finicky details. And very often when you're doing mathematics, you're kind of gambling against the problem. You're like: maybe I should try this approach, but it seems really unlikely and just not worth my time. And the model, I think, in several of these cases, both by combining what it knew and sort of having good taste, kind of made the correct bet. And you can kind of see...

### 推理模型的数学判断力与搜索树剪枝

**Speaker A**：在我们公开发布的总结性思维链（chain of thought）中，你可以看到这一点。仔细审视它的过程，你会发现它的推理方式非常像一名数学家：正因为它掌握了一些非常关键且正确的要点，它便能够做出恰当的决策，并最终成功对搜索树进行剪枝。它并不是在盲目尝试所有的可能性，尽管它确实尝试了许多不同的方向。它极其坚韧执着，但同时……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ... this in, um, the summarized chain of thought we released. You can sort of look at it and it's reasoning like a mathematician, and because it knows a few very correct bits, it makes the right decisions and is eventually able to prune the search tree. It's not really trying everything. It tries a lot of different things. It's extremely dogged, but it kind of...

</details>

**Speaker B**：我的意思是，它不可能去穷举每一种想法。它必须在有限的想法集合中进行探索，并且能够结合自身的知识储备以及良好的数学直觉与判断力，找到正确的前进路径。对我而言，这非常令人震撼，因为这个问题此前已经有很多人深入思考过了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: I mean it can't try every idea. It has to try a limited set of ideas and it's able to kind of use its knowledge plus good mathematical judgment and find the right path to go along. So I mean that for me was like because this was a problem which a lot of people had thought about and yeah.

</details>

**Speaker A**：这种思路并非前所未见的异想天开，这一事实恰恰说明很多人之前都曾尝试过，或者至少有几位非常顶尖的数学家曾经探索过这个方向。我认为这正是让整个过程变得极其引人入胜的地方。

此外，当看到这些证明过程时，我内心还有另一种强烈的体会：作为人类，当我有了一个想法并试图去实现它时，我很可能会制定出一个完全行不通的错误方案。一旦你沿着一条错误的路径走了一段时间，要重塑大脑的认知、彻底推倒重来并尝试一条全新的路径，往往是极其困难的。因为在你脑海中，最初的那个核心想法已经与那些最终走不通的推导紧密纠缠在一起了。这就好比你的“上下文窗口”（context window）被污染了，而你又不可能直接克隆一个上周的自己，对自己说：“别走这条路，换个方向试试，往另一个方向建立你的直觉。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I mean the idea, the fact that the idea is not so foreign probably indicates that a lot of people had tried it or at least a few very serious mathematicians have tried, and I think that's what made it really interesting to see. I think something else that like I feel when I see these proofs is like, if I have an idea and I'm trying to execute, it might be that I have some wrong plan for how to get things to work. And as a human, if you have some wrong path you go down for a while, it can be hard to rewire your brain to start over and try a different path. Your initial idea is linked in your brain with these other things that ended up not working. You know, it's sort of like your context window is a little polluted, and you can't just make another clone of yourself from last week and say, you know, don't do this, try something else, build your intuition in another direction...

</details>

**Speaker B**：但是对于人工智能来说，做到这一点非常容易。所以我认为这也是另一个关键原因……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: ...but you know it's very easy to do this with an AI. So, I think this is another reason that it's like...

</details>

**Speaker A**：嗯，一旦你掌握了良好的大方向，把细节推导正确突然之间就不再是什么不可逾越的障碍了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...um it like getting the details right once you have some good general direction is like much less of a barrier all of a sudden.

</details>

### 回溯机制与上下文纯净性：AI 与人类思维的对比

**Speaker B**：而且当你提到用 AI 做这件事容易得多时，这其中其实完全没有人类的直接干预。就像你刚才在推理轨迹（reasoning traces）中所描述的那样，是模型自己在做出这些选择。也许它会经历回溯（backtrack），但它能够完全不被之前思考问题时的旧上下文所干扰，通过自身的机制重新出发。

在实际观察中，你们是否确实看到它具有这种回溯的能力？还是说它只是单纯运气好、做出了正确的选择？这是一个偶发的幸运样本（lucky sample），还是它真的像数学家那样在严谨推理——意识到“好吧，这条路走不通”，然后退回到起点，并且完全不让失败的尝试污染后续的思考？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And when you say it's much easier to do with AI, it's not actually being directed with human interference too. It's like, as you were saying in the reasoning traces, it's making these choices. Maybe it backtracks, but then it's able to not be distracted by maybe like the context in which it's thinking about the problem via these machinery, and it's like go back... do you see it kind of go back as well or is it just like making good choices? Is it a lucky sample or is it like actually reasoning like a mathematician where okay, it doesn't do well in this path, but it goes back, but then it doesn't let that pollute?

</details>

**Speaker A**：不，它绝对会犯错，而且在犯错之后它会回溯并重新审视问题。我认为它在某种程度上计算极其精准、逻辑非常严密。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: No, I mean it definitely makes mistakes and then it goes back and thinks about it. I think it's somehow very calculating, very correct. I mean, yeah.

</details>

**Speaker B**：作为人类数学家，在做这些决策时往往无法做到尽善尽美……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: As human mathematicians, you're not always perfect at making these decisions and like...

</details>

**Speaker A**：比如当某种方法第一次失败时，人类会不由自主地大幅调低这种方法的可行性预期，尝试几次之后就会彻底放弃。但在我们所见到的几个解法中，模型表现得明显出色得多，它能够更加客观地评估一条路径成功的概率，而不是像人类那样轻易全盘否定某种方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...like the first time something doesn't work, you automatically kind of downgrade how likely this approach is to work and you keep doing this a few times. The model somehow is much better able to... it seems for several of the solutions we've seen, somehow it seems much better able to update how likely the path is to work versus rejecting a path versus a human doing it.

</details>

**Speaker B**：但我觉得即便模型自身没有这种完美的概率更新机制，只要你可以直接重启一个全新的模型会话，就意味着你始终可以做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: But I think even if it weren't, the fact that you could just start another model session over means that, you know, it's always going to be the case that...

</details>

**Speaker A**：我明白你的意思。从某种意义上说，这确实利用了你可以针对同一个问题并行运行多个智能体（parallel agents）的优势。但如果它本身就具备回溯能力，那确实会让它看起来更像一名人类数学家。而且很可能它自身确实在进行类似的操作，因为很显然，我们人类必须通过犯错，才能建立起对于“为什么该解空间不在可行路径集合内”的直觉认知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Got it here. So in some sense it is still leveraging the fact that you could run parallel agents on the problem. But if it were kind of backtracking, then does make it seem much more like a human mathematician, and perhaps it is kind of doing some of that stuff too, because obviously we have to make mistakes in order to even gain intuition for why that solution space is not in the set of paths that it could be in.

</details>

**Speaker B**：人类之间也会发生类似的情况：当你陷入某种方法的死胡同卡住时，你可能会把自己的大致构想告诉另一个人，然后对方回过头来，想出把它做通的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: I mean, I think this kind of thing happens with humans, too, where if you get stuck on some approach, you might tell another human your kind of general idea and then they'll come back and figure out how to get it to work and you know, it's just...

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah.

</details>

### 数学文献的局限与通用推理能力的涌现

**Speaker B**：在人类之间做这种协作需要花费更多的时间。这让我不禁思考一个问题——当然是在你能公开讨论的范围内，显然不用透露具体的训练配方或细节——令人感到非常奇妙的是，如果你仅仅去学习现有的数学论文，从先验角度来看，这其实是一个非常糟糕的数学训练集。数学教科书甚至是一个更典型的例子：它们极度不擅长重构当初人们构想这些概念的原始动机。

也许有些人喜欢，但千万别指望从鲁丁（Rudin）的书中去学会真正的实分析！那本书的呈现方式已经过于干净、凝练了。我认为这在教学上是有缺陷的，因为它完全没有展示出促使我们以某种特定方式构建定义的艰难挣扎过程。比如，我们为什么非要用如此高度抽象的方式去定义实数？论文也是同理，绝大多数人在撰写论文时，并不是带着“我要把读者培养成一名数学家”的教学背景去写的。因此，学习数学的真实认知演进脉络，实际上并没有内嵌在我们作为数学家所留下的这些学术成果之中。

所以换一种方式来提这个问题：如果这些推理轨迹确实生成了更加贴近真实数学思维的内容，这种能力究竟是如何产生的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: It takes more time to do this with humans. I wonder... I mean, you know, maybe this gets to the extent that you can actually talk about sort of like—obviously don't talk about the training recipes or whatever—but it's interesting that if you're just studying, for instance, math papers, it's a very poor training set a priori for math. Because, I mean, maybe math textbooks are even a pure example of this: it's really bad at actually reconstructing the motivation for why things were... I mean, maybe some people like it, but don't learn real analysis from Rudin! It's very clean already and crisp. And I think that's bad because it doesn't show the struggle that made us formulate definitions in a certain way. Like, why do we even need to have real numbers be defined in this super abstract way, etc.? And so, you know, I think papers also... I mean, most people don't write papers with the context of "I need to educate somebody to be a mathematician", and so the actual curriculum of learning math is not inherent in a lot of our artifacts as mathematicians. So maybe another way to ask this question is: if the reasoning traces are actually producing things that are more close to mathematical thought, how does that arise?

</details>

**Speaker A**：我想说的是，OpenAI 一直是推理模型领域的先驱，率先探索了如何教会 AI 以这种模式进行思考与推理。因此，我们在各个可能的方向上都投入了大量工作，致力于让模型在更长的时间跨度内、在各种不同的领域中实现更优秀的推理表现。

我们训练的是通用推理模型（general purpose reasoning models）。我们在数学层面上描述的许多行为——比如回溯、推倒重来等等——其实并不是数学领域所独有的。虽然在这些例子中我们是在数学场景下观察到了它们，但它们本质上是通用的推理工具。我认为，只要你在“提升推理能力”这一方向上持续深耕，最终都必然会看到这些模式的涌现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Um, I mean, yeah, I guess OpenAI has been the pioneer of reasoning models and, you know, teaching AI to reason in this way. So we're doing a lot of work in all possible directions on teaching models to reason better and for longer, and in all kinds of different domains. I think we're training general purpose reasoning models, and a lot of these behaviors that we're describing mathematically, like backtracking or kind of starting again... these are not really specific to mathematics. We're seeing them specifically in mathematics in these examples, but they're general purpose tools for reasoning. And I think if you work hard at reasoning, you should see these patterns eventually. Mhm.

### 代码数据与数学推理：从语法到高层语义的跃迁

**Speaker B**：所以这是一种涌现出来的能力？因为我认为这正是 OpenAI 方法的精妙之处：它并不依赖形式化自动证明（autoformalization）来引导推理过程，而这种方式显然更加贴近人类的思维习惯。

但是有一点并不显然：如果你仅仅是在数学证明语料库上进行训练（即使是在 Lean 中进行了自动形式化），你是否真的能获得“如何正确思考”的认知映射？换个角度来看代码：代码是一个非常优质的训练语料，因为它是为数不多的具有如此庞大上下文的数据集之一。你可能在书籍中也能看到长上下文，但书籍在结构上的内在关联性更低，平均而言其结构化程度远不如代码。

回到数学论文与代码的对比，也许目前我们在代码模型上仍然欠缺的，恰恰是数据集本身所不包含的内容——也就是深层的语义。语法虽然一应俱全，但关于“为什么我必须以这种方式编写代码”的高层语义却相对匮乏。我可能把话题扯得有点过于哲学化了，但看到模型涌现出如此高水平的数学推理能力，确实令人惊叹。如果我们稍后深入讨论具体问题，大家就会发现，它绝不仅仅是在按照预期进行简单的“暴力穷举”。很显然，你们对其中的一些推理轨迹感到非常惊艳，而这些能力绝非轻易就能从我们所能想到的常规训练集中直接获取到的。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So it's emergent? Because I do think that's why the OpenAI approach... it doesn't rely on doing autoformalization in order to guide the reasoning, and I think that's obviously more like us. But it's just so not obvious that if you're just training on say a corpus of math proofs, maybe autoformalized in Lean, that you get the sort of projection of how to think well. Put another way, with code: code is such a good corpus to train on because it's one of the few datasets that has such large context. Maybe you see this kind of with books, but they're less structurally interconnected, there's just less structure there on average in a book compared to a piece of code. And so with math papers, maybe what we're still bad at with coding models is stuff that that dataset doesn't contain, which is the semantics—the syntax is there, but there's a little bit of the higher level semantics of why do I have to write it this way. I'm getting too much into the philosophical, but it is just really interesting how it's still emergent that it's doing good mathematics. And we'll probably get into this in more detail if you wanted to talk about some of the problems, which is not just doing the expected "let's push the brute force thing". You clearly are impressed with some of the reasoning traces, and it's just not obvious that's gleaned from what we would imagine would be the easy training set here.

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的，完全没错。我认为这种……

**Speaker A**: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think this kind of...

### 模型思维链的公开与人类专家的相似性

**研究员 A**：这就是我们决定公开发布这类结果的思维链总结（summarized chains of thought）的重要原因之一。因为如果你以前从未见过这些内容，只是看到所有这些数学证明被直接输出出来，你其实会有些拿不准这到底意味着什么——比如，模型是不是通过某种极其不可思议的方式瞎猜出来的？它是不是在用某种完全异于人类的方式进行思考？究竟背后发生了什么？但实际上，它的推理过程与人类专家的思考方式惊人地相似。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: ...thing is one reason we decided it was important to release like these summarized chains of thought for these kinds of results because if you've never seen these and you just see all these proofs coming out, you're kind of not sure what it means. Like is the model just guessing in some insane way? Like is it thinking in some totally foreign like what's going on? But actually it's reasoning kind of shockingly like an expert human would.

</details>

**主持人**：是的，确实如此。读起来的感觉非常像是在看同事随手写下的草稿笔记。我的意思是，在某种程度上它可能稍微显得更杂乱无章一些。但就像你平时与合作者非常紧密地共事时那样，有时他们会直接在发给你的邮件里一股脑倾倒出他们当时所有的想法，读这个模型思维链的感觉，就非常像把很多这类零散想法串联在了一起。所以刚开始看的前几次确实会觉得非常震撼。对了，在 Astro 尝试解决的这最后一组 10 道题目中，你们两位当时在选题发布方面参与度高吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's very much like reading a colleague's like notes. I mean, it's a little more disorganized in some way. Especially if you work close enough with collaborators, sometimes you'll just see them like spill out their thoughts in an email to you, and it kind of feels like reading a lot of those chained together. So, yeah, it's quite surprising the first few times. Were you two sort of very involved in choosing the problems to release in this like last 10 problem set that Astros applied to?

</details>

**主持人**：哪一道是你们最喜欢的题目？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Which was your favorite?

</details>

**研究员 A**：对，我们确实深度参与了选题。你要先聊聊你的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, we were definitely involved. Do you want to start on?

</details>

**研究员 B**：可以啊，要不从球体堆积（sphere packing）问题开始？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher B**: Yeah, I mean packing maybe.

</details>

### 球体堆积问题与低维情形（$d=1, 2, 3$）

**研究员 A**：好的，那我就先讲讲这道题。在这些问题当中，我个人最喜欢的是下面这个。这是一个表面上极其简单的问题，本质上探讨的就是：你如何以最高效率将一堆球体紧密排列放置？我画的圆圈画得不太好，大小也画得不太一样，但……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, I guess. So, I guess my personal favorite among these problems is the following. It's an extremely simple question which is just about how efficiently can you put a bunch—my circles are not very good and they're not all the same size, but...

</details>

**主持人**：但我们假设它们的尺寸是完全相同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: But we're assuming they are.

</details>

**研究员 A**：没错。所以这个问题就是：在一组 $d$ 维空间中放置若干个半径为 1 的超球体，你最多能把它们排得多致密？换句话说，它们的最大堆积密度是多少？在二维空间中，这有点像大家非常熟悉且喜欢的那个经典图像——就是一堆圆球紧贴着排列，自然构成了一个正六边形晶格点阵（hexagonal lattice）。希望我画得足够清楚，能把六边形勾勒出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah. So the question is just like how dense can you place a bunch of—so you have a bunch of spheres of radius one in $d$ dimensions. So the question is how densely can they pack? And so in two dimensions it's kind of like the—so for $d=1$, this is not an interesting question really, it's just the real line and you can cut it up, and a sphere in dimension one is just a unit segment so okay you can cover everything. So in $d=2$, it's kind of the picture that everybody loves, it's just a bunch of spheres which sort of form like a hexagonal lattice. Hopefully I've drawn it well enough that I can draw the hexagon.

</details>

**主持人**：这可能暴露了我在这类问题上的浅薄认知——二维下的六边形堆积最优性是很显而易见的吗？是否存在一个非常优雅的数学证明能直接证明最优结构必须是这种晶格点阵？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Kind of betraying my naivete on this problem. Is that like obvious? Is there like a very elegant proof that it's lattice?

</details>

**研究员 A**：其实并没有那么显而易见。事实上，这个结论直到上世纪 60 年代才被严格证明出来。虽然有一个相对简短的论证过程，但绝不是轻易就能看出来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, it's not so obvious that this should work. It was only proven in the 60s, I think. There's a short argument, but it's not so easy.

</details>

**主持人**：那背后的几何直觉在哪里？这个证明的核心论证机制大概是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Where's the intuition? Like what is kind of like the machinery of the argument?

</details>

**研究员 B**：它看起来确实显然就应该是这样摆放的，这也是为什么大家直觉上……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher B**: I mean it definitely looks like it should work. That's why we're...

</details>

**研究员 A**：是的。我认为这正是这类问题最有意思的地方——实际上没有人真正能完全搞懂这个问题的深层本质。坦白讲，对于二维情况我能给出的最好直觉就是：大自然里的蜜蜂筑巢就是这么排列蜂窝的；如果存在某种更高效的排列方式，蜜蜂大概率在演化过程中早就采用另一种方式去筑造蜂巢了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah. So I think this is the best part about this problem which is really nobody has any idea about this problem. Honestly the best intuition I have for this is that bees do this, and if there was a more efficient way then probably bees would pack honeycomb some other way.

</details>

**主持人**：演化的力量是极度追求效率的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Evolution is efficient.

</details>

**研究员 A**：没错。除此之外，我自己也没有什么太好的纯直觉论据。而且，要想了解人类在这个领域的认知有多么匮乏，只要看三维情况（$d=3$）就清楚了：在三维空间中，最优答案其实就是杂货店里堆叠橙子的那种常见堆法（开普勒猜想）。然而这个结论直到 2000 年代初期才由托马斯·黑尔斯（Thomas Hales）通过计算机辅助彻底证实。而且直到今天我们依然没有简短的证明，目前已有的最短证明篇幅也长达数百页。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah. I think beyond that, I don't have a great argument. And I think how little we know is demonstrated by the fact that for $d=3$, the answer is just how you pack oranges in a grocery store. And this was only proved by Hales sometime in the 2000s, and we don't have a short proof of this—I think the shortest proof is like a few hundred pages.

</details>

**主持人**：那黑尔斯的证明主要是借助了数学中哪个领域的工具？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what area does it draw from in order to...

</details>

**研究员 A**：它大量使用了线性规划（Linear Programming）的论证方法，并且涉及极其精细繁复的局部几何构型分析。实际上整个论证过程相当冗长丑陋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: So it's a lot of linear programming arguments and it's very delicate geometry. It's quite ugly actually.

</details>

**主持人**：这在数学界算是公认极其繁复丑陋的一个证明了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: This is like a famously ugly argument.

</details>

**研究员 A**：可不是嘛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Oh no.

</details>

### 特殊高维空间的最优解（$d=8$ 与 $d=24$）

**研究员 A**：紧接着，球体堆积领域最著名的两个里程碑结果出现在 8 维（$d=8$）和 24 维（$d=24$）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: And then the two most famous results are $d=8$ and $24$.

</details>

**主持人**：8 维和 24 维？这背后肯定存在某种奇妙的对称子空间或者特殊代数结构。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: $8$ and $24$. There must be some like weird subspace.

</details>

**研究员 A**：没错，完全正确！这是在 2017 年前后被证明的（玛丽娜·维亚佐夫斯卡等人）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, exactly. So this was done in 2017.

</details>

**主持人**：希望这两个维度的证明比起三维来要优美得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sounds slightly prettier though, I hope.

</details>

**研究员 A**：确实优美得多。之所以能在这两个非常特殊的维度精确求解，原因在于它们都属于所谓的“晶格堆积”（lattice packing）——结构具有极高的规则性与对称性。事实证明，在这两个维度下存在两种极其特殊的几何点阵，分别被称为 $E_8$ 晶格点阵和利奇晶格（Leech lattice）。它们非常优美，而且密度异乎寻常地高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: So the reason it works out in these two very special dimensions is that this is called a lattice packing. So it's very regular, and it turns out in these two dimensions there are two very special lattices. They're called the $E_8$ and Leech lattice, and they're very nice and unusually dense.

</details>

**研究员 B**：它们源自数学其他领域的深刻研究，是非常非常漂亮对称的结构，最终被证明正是对应维度下的全局最优堆积结构。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher B**: They're just very, very pretty structures coming from other areas of math, and it turns out that they're the optimal structures.

</details>

**主持人**：但它们本质上仍然是规则点阵堆积。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: But they're still like regular.

</details>

**研究员 A**：是的，非常规则。但除此以外，对于其他任何维度我们都不知道精确的最优堆积密度了。人类迄今为止确切知道精确解的只有这 5 个维度（$d=1, 2, 3, 8, 24$），对其余所有维度几乎一无所知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, they're very regular. But beyond this, we don't know any more exact dimensions. We know these five dimensions and we kind of don't know anything else.

</details>

### 高维渐近界的差距与反直觉几何现象

**研究员 A**：为了让你感受一下我们对高维情况的理解有多么匮乏，这里有两个非常惊人的事实。如果我们将 $\Delta_d$ 定义为 $d$ 维空间中球体堆积的最大密度，其实很容易得到一个简单的下界，大约是 $2^{-d}$。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: And to give an indication of how little we know, there are two very surprising things about this. So you can define $\Delta_d$ to be the densest sphere packing in $d$ dimensions. There's kind of an easy lower bound of like $2^{-d}$.

</details>

**研究员 B**：证明这个并不难。基本上只要构造一个贪心排列，当其中无法再塞入任何一个额外的球体时，它的整体堆积密度就必然至少达到 $2^{-d}$。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher B**: This is not so hard to show. Basically, any packing where you can't put in another sphere has to have this density.

</details>

**研究员 A**：对，所以这个值还不算小得离谱。而且我们知道随着维度升高，最大密度必然以指数级衰减。也就是说，上界表现为形式如 $(1 - c)^d$（对应常数 $c$）的指数衰减，因此在高维空间中，球体能够填充覆盖的空间比例会迅速缩减到趋近于零的极小份额。但除此之外，我们几乎什么都不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: So, okay, it's not ridiculously small. And we know that it has to decay exponentially—so it decays like it grows like $1 - c$ for some constant. In large dimensions, you can only cover a vanishingly small portion. But we know basically nothing else.

</details>

**主持人**：这主要是因为高维超球体本身的体积性质非常反直觉吧，比如它在高维立方体中所占的体积占比会急剧萎缩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's just because like the high dimensional sphere thing where it occupies—the volume behavior is weird.

</details>

**研究员 A**：没错，由于球体之间彼此排斥不能重叠，在高维空间中这一点表现得更加极端。我不认为存在某种特别简短直观的几句话能完全解释为什么它必然呈指数级微小，但在数学上已知确实如此。在很长一段时间里，数学界能给出的最好上界是一个奇怪的数值，大致是 $2^{-0.599 d}$。这是由两位俄罗斯数学家（卡巴强斯基与列文斯坦，Kabatiansky & Levenshtein）在上世纪 70 年代证明出来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah. Basically they don't want to touch next to each other. I don't think there's a particularly short way to see that it's exponentially small, but it's known to be exponentially small. And for a long, long time the best bound was something like this funny number, like $2^{-0.599 d}$. This was proved by two mathematicians in the 70s (Kabatiansky and Levenshtein).

</details>

**主持人**：这个指数上的 $0.599$ 确实是个非常奇怪的数字，它是从哪里推导出来的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay, that's a weird number. Where's that spit out of?

</details>

**研究员 A**：它来自于求解某个极其丑陋复杂的最优化问题的极值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: It's the answer to some extremely ugly optimization problem.

</details>

**研究员 B**：不过它背后其实有一套非常漂亮的底层核心策略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher B**: There's a nice underlying strategy.

</details>

**研究员 A**：关于这两位苏联数学家在 70 年代的工作，我再说最后一点：现在其实很难找到他们当年的原始论文，整篇论文只有短短一两页。因为篇幅极其受限，他们在文章里几乎没写太多细节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, I'll say one last thing about this. These were these two Russian mathematicians in the 70s. It's actually very hard to find their paper. It's like two pages long. They don't write very many details because the paper was short.

</details>

**主持人**：刚才说的 $2^{-d}$ 下界，就是简单按超立方体方格点阵（square lattice）那样排列吗，还是有其他构造？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: $2^{-d}$ is just like the square lattice, like the dumb one, or is that...

</details>

**研究员 A**：其实并不是那么简单。这个下界的严格论证是这样的：想象你在空间中放置了一组互不重叠的单位球体，并且尽可能不断添加，直到空间中没有任何空隙能够再塞入任何一个额外的球体。考虑任意一个满足这种“极大不可添加”性质的球体堆积。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: It's actually not so easy to... The argument for this is as follows: basically imagine that you have a set of spheres and you construct a set of spheres so that you can't put down another sphere, because if you could put down an extra sphere, you just keep putting it down. So you have a set of spheres so that there's no other sphere which you can put down. Take any such packing.

</details>

**研究员 A**：我断言这种堆积所占据的空间体积比例至少为 $2^{-d}$。理由非常直接：如果你把当前堆积中的每一个球体的半径放大到原来的两倍（体积放大到 $2^d$ 倍），这些膨胀后的球体就必须完全覆盖整个空间的每一个点。因为反之，如果放大两倍后空间中依然存在没有被覆盖的空隙点，那就说明在原点处本就可以再塞进一个新的单位球体，这与前提矛盾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: And I claim that this has to cover at least $2^{-d}$ fraction. The reason is that if you blew up each of these spheres by a factor of two, then they have to cover every point in space. And the reason is otherwise if there was any empty space, you could put down a sphere there.

</details>

**主持人**：明白了。如果只是采取普通的正交方格点阵排列，实际上对角线方向会有更多的空隙可以继续塞球进去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So I guess if you take the usual lattice, there are actually like more places you can put things kind of diagonally.

</details>

**研究员 A**：没错，那样做得到的密度实际上会更差。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Okay. Yeah. So that's actually like a worse bound.

</details>

**主持人**：因为在空隙里还可以继续不断塞球进去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. You can just keep plopping things in.

</details>

**研究员 A**：对，这与高维空间中一个非常有趣的几何反常现象密切相关：如果你在高维超立方体的每个角顶点都放置一个内切球体……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah. This is related to this really funny fact where if you take a cube in high dimensions, you put a sphere on every point.

</details>

**主持人**：这些球体的相对体积占比小到几乎可以忽略不计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's like vanishingly small.

</details>

**研究员 A**：确实小到极致。它小到什么程度呢？你甚至可以在超立方体最中心留出的空隙里再塞进一个球体，而且它能完全容纳进去，甚至半径随着维度增大还能超越超立方体边界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: It's vanishingly small. It's so small you can put another sphere in the middle and it fits.

</details>

**主持人**：高维超球体的几何特性的确非常诡异反直觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: High dimensional sphere behavior is weird.

</details>

### AI 模型的突破：线性规划界（LP Bound）

**研究员 A**：是的，极其反常。而令人惊叹的地方就在于模型给出的证明：这里我写下两点。针对这个问题，Astro 模型（或者这里最准确的称呼）展现出了以下成果：我接下来要写下一个被称为线性规划界（LP bound）的方法……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher A**: Yeah, very weird. And so the great part is that the model shows the following. So I'll write two things. This is Astra, I guess probably the right way to refer to this. I'm going to write something called the LP bound. I'm...

</details>

<!-- chunk 4/8 -->

### 高维球堆积的线性规划界与渐近行为

**Speaker A**: 我稍后会解释这一点。它表明这个值小于这个非常漂亮的数字。你想写等于吗？是的，它基本上等于 $(e / (2\pi) + o(1))^d$。如果你去计算这个具体数值是多少，它大概就像……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...not. I'll explain this in a second. And it shows that it's smaller than this very nice number. Do you want to say equals? Yeah, it's equal essentially to $(e / (2\pi) + o(1))^d$. And if you can work out what this number is, it's like...

</details>

**Speaker B**: 大概是类似 $2^{-0.6d}$ 这样的形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: It's like roughly something like $2^{-0.6...}$

</details>

**Speaker A**: 很接近了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Close.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 是的，挺出人意料的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah, it's surprising.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 但是这个形式，比如包含 $e$ 和 $\pi$ 的表达式，你会觉得也许背后存在着某种脱颖而出的优美结构。它至多是……这大概相当于 $2^{-0.61...d}$。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: But this one, you know, $e$ to... you're like, oh, maybe there's some nicer kind of structure there that fell out. It's at most... this is like roughly something like $2^{-0.61...d}$.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 那是具体的数值计算结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: That's the numeric.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 我之前以为是 0.604。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I thought it was 604.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Great.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 好的，有几点需要说明。首先，这里的 $\text{LP}(d)$ 是什么？Viazovska 的工作实际上建立在一些更早的研究基础之上。事实证明，有一种方法可以通过所谓的线性规划界（Linear Programming bound）来攻克球堆积问题。LP 就代表线性规划。Cohn 和 Elkies 提出了一种基于线性规划来解决球堆积问题的方法。这相当于在凸集上求解线性优化问题，不过在这里它是某种无限维的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, this shows mine. Yeah. So okay, so there are a couple of things. So first, what is this $\text{LP}(d)$? So Viazovska's work actually builds on some earlier work. It turns out that there's a way to attack sphere packing via what's called a linear programming bound. So LP just stands for linear programming. So Cohn and Elkies gave an approach for sphere packing based on linear programming. So it's like a linear optimization problem over a convex set, but it's all kind of infinite-dimensional here.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 基本上，这可以归结为去理解以下内容：你试图去构造一个函数 $f$。这是一个定义在 $d$ 维空间中、映射到实数集 $\mathbb{R}$ 的函数，它满足以下性质：第一，函数 $f(x)$ 在 $\|x\| > 1$ 时始终小于等于 0；第二，它的傅里叶变换 $\widehat{f}(x)$ 始终非负。之所以说这是一个线性规划问题，是因为傅里叶变换是一个线性算子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And basically what this reduces down to is you try to understand the following. So what you try to show is you basically construct a function $f$. So this is in $d$ dimensions and it's mapping to $\mathbb{R}$, and it has the following properties. So first, $f(x)$—this is a function in $d$ dimensions—is always less than zero if the size of $x$ is bigger than 1; and second, you have that the Fourier transform of $x$ is always non-negative. So this is just a linear program because the Fourier transform is a linear operator.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 所以你只需要取任意一个满足这些性质的 $f$ 即可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So you're taking just some arbitrary $f$ that satisfies this property.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的。你可以取任何满足这些性质的函数 $f$。他们证明了密度 $\Delta_d$ 可以被一个比值所界定：即 $f(0)$ 与傅里叶变换在零点处的值之比，再除以 $d$ 维空间中半径为 $1/2$ 的球体体积。这个证明对于经验丰富的数学家来说并不算长，大概半个段落就能证完，但技巧性很强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. So you can take any $f$ that satisfies these properties. And what they prove is that $\Delta_d$ is bounded by the ratio of the Fourier transform at zero... of $f(0)$ over the Fourier transform at zero times the volume of the ball of radius $1/2$ in $d$ dimensions. And so, okay, this proof is not so short... for experienced mathematicians it took half a paragraph to prove it, but it's a little bit tricky.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 关键在于，这是一个松弛问题（relaxation problem）。并不能保证选取最优的 $f$ 就一定能给出关于 $\Delta_d$ 的紧界。但 Viazovska 所做的工作——也是她在 2022 年荣获菲尔兹奖的很大一部分原因——在于她在 8 维和 24 维空间中构造出了具体的函数，使得这个线性规划上界与这两个非常特殊的格（E8 和 Leech 格）的密度完全吻合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And the point is, so it turns out this is a relaxation problem. There's no guarantee that taking the optimal $f$ will give you a good bound on $\Delta_d$. But what Viazovska did—and this was sort of the key, I mean a large part of the reason she won a Fields Medal in 2022 was that—she constructed a function in 8 and 24 dimensions such that this upper bound matches exactly these two very special lattices.

</details>

### AI 模型在高维分析中的突破

**Speaker B**: 这简直是大自然的奇迹：你既能构造出这样的函数，它又能恰好给出最优界。但这本身是一个非常自然的问题：一个具有两个非常简单性质的函数，你只想知道它在很大维度下的表现如何。这此前一直是一个巨大的谜团。曾经有 Cohn 等人撰写的数值分析论文，仅基于数值实验猜想过这个答案，但他们完全不知道为什么答案会是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And these are kind of miracles of nature that both you can construct this function and that it gives you the optimal bound. But this is a very, very natural problem. I mean, it's a function with two very simple properties, and you just want to understand how this behaves for large dimensions $d$, and that was a big mystery. There was a numeric paper by Cohn and several others which conjectured that, just based on doing numerics, that this was the answer, but they had no idea why this would be the answer.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 而模型所展现出的是，在高维情况下，线性规划界确实具有极其优美的渐近行为。它的证明在某种程度上解释了这一结果的来源。由于彻底理解了这个 LP 界，实际上也就给出了关于 $\Delta_d$ 的一个更好的界。事实证明，以前的旧界也可以在这个框架下重新解释，而模型所做的是展示了在这个框架下所能获得的最优界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And what the model shows is that actually the linear programming bound in large dimensions has this extremely nice asymptotic behavior, and the proof kind of explains where this is coming from. And because you understand this LP bound perfectly, this actually just gives a better bound on $\Delta_d$. It turns out that this old bound can be kind of reinterpreted in this framework, and what the model does is it shows you the best possible bound you can get by this framework.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 所以模型建立起了这种联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So the model sort of made the connection and...

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的。模型给出的是一个函数 $f$：首先它构造出了能给出该上界的函数 $f$，接着证明了不存在任何函数 $f$ 能做到更好。因此这是一个等式结论，性质非常强。所以我们现在对高维下的这个问题有了非常深入的理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yes. The model gives a function $f$ which... so first it constructs a function $f$ which gives you this bound, and then it shows that there's no function $f$ which does any better. So it's an equality, which is quite strong. So we now understand this problem in high dimensions very well.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 这确实非常了不起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And that's pretty remarkable.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 模型当时接到的提示大概就是“去分析高维下的这个线性规划，尽情探索吧”。为了说明之前的猜想有多缺乏理论根据——它基本上完全建立在数值模拟之上，虽然是非常高超的数值计算，但终究只是数值拟合。因此你必须去弄清楚为什么这才是正确的目标，而模型做到了，这确实令人赞叹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And the model was just kind of told like, "Analyze this linear program in high dimensions, you know, go have fun." And to give an indication of how little... I think this conjecture was based basically only by doing numerics—extremely clever numerics, but numerics—and so you have to kind of figure out why this is the right thing to aim for, and it does, and that was pretty remarkable.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 我读研究生的时候确实思考过这个问题大概六个月，我记得当时完全没有任何进展。所以能看到有人解释清楚它为什么是对的，真是一种非常愉悦的体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, I mean, I had actually thought about this problem for about six months at some point when I was a graduate student and, yeah, just... I remember making like absolutely zero progress on it. So it was very nice to be explained why it was... yeah, why it was true. So that was a pleasant experience.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 我想总体而言，这也是许多人都曾尝试过的问题之一。它非同寻常的地方在于，模型的解法非常简短，特别是证明“LP 无法做到更好”的那部分。虽然包含了几页复分析的内容，但思路完全切中要害。一旦你看到了这个证明，你会觉得难以置信，心想为什么之前从来没有人这么做过？优秀的数学研究有很多种类型，但我认为其中一种就是：当你看到它时会忍不住感叹“天哪，我怎么就没想到呢？”能见证这样的解法非常有趣。这也是为什么我非常喜欢这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: I think also in general it was one of these solutions which... I knew several people had tried the problem. It's pretty remarkable because the model's solution, especially for this being like that the LP can't do better than this, was quite short. It's a few pages of complex analysis, but it's kind of exactly the right approach. Like once you see it, it's unbelievable, like why hadn't somebody done this before? There are many types of good mathematics, but I think one of them is just like you see it and you're like, "Oh man, why didn't I think of this?" And it was really fun and... I mean, I sort of knew why I didn't think of it, but it was quite nice to see it and it was fun to see. That's why I like this problem a lot.

### 从球面码到纠错码

**Speaker A**: 是的。这是 Astra 解决的 10 个问题中的第一个。而第二个问题实际上与它密切相关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. So this is the first of the 10 problems that Astra saw. But the second is actually closely related.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 第一个是球堆积问题。第二个则是关于球面码（Spherical Codes）与二进制码（Binary Codes）的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So this was sphere packing. The second one is spherical and binary codes.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 你应该画一个码的示意图。你刚才画了球堆积，其实两者的图像基本是一样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: So what's... you should draw a code. You drew a packing. It's going to be the same picture. Okay, sure, sure.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 不然我们脑海里就全是他的堆积图像了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Otherwise, we're going to have his picture packing in our mind.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的。球面码字面意思上其实就是定义在另一个球面表面的球堆积。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. A spherical code is literally just a sphere packing, but on another sphere.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 没错，球面码基本上就是分布在另一个球体表面上的球堆积。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. So, I mean, a spherical code is basically just a sphere packing on the surface of another sphere. So, yeah.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的，它看起来就像一个球面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, it looks like a sphere.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 好的。图像跟之前一样，只是现在处于一个弯曲的表面上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. Okay. So, same picture as before, except you're kind of on a curved surface. Okay, okay.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 那么，为什么它被称为“码”呢？我想原因在于二进制码，这又是类似的概念，只不过现在它定义在一个超立方体上。好的，让我在立方体上画一个最简单的码的示意图。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Okay. So why is it called a code? Well, I guess the reason is because of binary codes, which is again the same sort of thing, but now it's on a cube. Okay. Yeah, fine. Let me draw a picture of a cube and some simplest possible code on it.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 当你在发送信息时，这实际上涉及到纠错码（error-correcting codes）。什么是纠错码呢？比如我给你发送一串比特流，我担心传输过程中某些比特会发生损坏翻转。可能由于系统中的某些噪声误差，某个比特改变了，而我们希望有一种通信协议，使得你能够纠正这种小范围的错误，并恢复出我原本想要传达的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: So like when you're sending... so this is really like about error-correcting codes. So what are error-correcting codes? So, you know, it's like I send you some string of bits, right? And maybe I'm worried that some of the bits I send you get corrupted, right? So maybe like just because of some errors in my system, like this one gets changed, and we want some communication protocol so that like you can decode this like small amount of error and like recover what I was trying to tell you.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 日常的英语语言在某种程度上也具备这种性质，对吧？如果我打字出现了几个拼写错误，你依然能够理解我在说什么。但如果我们采用某种非常脆弱的通信机制，那它就无法工作了。因此，编码就是解决这个问题的途径。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And you know, like normal English language kind of has this sort of property, right? If I make a few typos, you know, you're going to be able to understand what I'm saying. But if we have some like really brittle communication scheme, it's not going to work. So codes are kind of the way you solve this.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 在数学上，这意味着具有固定长度的二进制字符串可以看作某个超立方体上的一个顶点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And mathematically, it just means like, you know, what's a binary string like this of a fixed length? It's like a point on some hypercube.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Mhm.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 我们希望构建一个由合法码字组成的字典，使得这些码字彼此之间保持足够的距离。比如在这个例子中，如果我们不希望任意两个码字相邻，我们可以选取这四个顶点——如果将各位数字相加，也就是取那些和为偶数的顶点。在这种情况下，虽然发生错误时你可能无法确切判定它是从哪一个码字变过来的，但至少你可以识别出它不是一个合法的码字……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And we want a dictionary of allowable codewords that are like separated from each other. So, like in this case, if I don't want any two to be adjacent, I would kind of take these four vertices, kind of the even ones if you sum up the digits, right? And like okay, I guess in this case if I have an error you can't tell which one it's from, but at least you can tell it's like not...

### 汉明距离、纠错码与高维球填充

**Speaker A**：……至少你能判断出里面存在错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...at least you can tell there was an error.

</details>

**Speaker B**：原来如此，我明白了。是的，因为在编码空间中它是相对稀疏的，它们不是相邻的两个点。所以当汉明距离不……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Oh I see. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's like kind of sparse in the... Yeah. It's like it's not two adjacent. So that like is this is like when the Hamming distance is not...

</details>

**Speaker A**：对，没错。你希望字典中任意两个不同码字之间都有足够大的汉明距离。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. You want Yeah. So you want like a large Hamming distance between any distinct in your in your dictionary.

</details>

**Speaker B**：我想如果是选取两个对角顶点，那么哪怕出现单比特错误，我也总能恢复出它原本来自哪个点——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And Yeah. I guess if you take two opposite corners then if I have like a single bit error I can always like recover which point it was coming from

</details>

**Speaker A**：也就是离它绝对最近的那一个点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: the one that it's definitely closest to.

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的。所以在两种情况下都存在同样的问题：在极高维度的设定下，你究竟能获得怎样的速率或密度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. So there's kind of the same question in both of these cases like in a very high-dimensional setting what kind of rate can you get?

</details>

**Speaker A**：对于二进制编码来说，这确实是一个极其现实且具有实际意义的问题。就像是：如果我给你发送一个 $n$ 比特的字符串，且信道有 1% 的误码率，那么为了容忍这种程度的错误，我的消息究竟需要增加多长？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And like for binary codes it's really like you know an extremely practical question. It's sort of like if I send you like an n-bit string and there's like 1% error rate, like how much longer does my message have to become to tolerate that amount of errors,

</details>

**Speaker B**：没错，这就是通信中某种基础的信息论极限。而且你可以发现，球面编码的情形与高维球填充问题非常相似。例如，如果你把所有这些小球的半径缩小到极致，那么大球面的曲率影响就会变得微乎其微，它看起来就完全等同于在全空间（欧几里得空间）中进行球填充。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: right this like some fundamental information theoretic limit of like communication. And you know, but you can see certainly this spherical case looks very much like sphere packing. For example, if you make all these little spheres really small, then the curvature of the big sphere is kind of not going to matter so much, and it looks like just packing spheres in full space.

</details>

### 表示论与代数对称性带来的突破

**Speaker A**：事实上，这些问题之间的关联极其紧密。针对这些问题，之前 Kabatiansky-Levenshtein (KL) 那些作者给出过类似的界限，既有针对球面情形的，也有针对超立方体情形的，但本质上都是相通的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Um, and in fact, yeah, like these problems turned out to be very related. So for these problems, there were similar bounds coming from these KL authors, and like there's like something for the sphere and something for the cube, but it's all kind of the same stuff. Mhm.

</details>

**Speaker A**：我们的模型在这些情形下也找到了更好的界。如果你把具体的证明技术写出来，它们看起来其实大相径庭。比如，之前针对全空间线性规划界分析使用的是复分析；

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And our models found better bounds for these cases as well. And like the techniques look pretty different actually if you write them out. So this full space analysis of this linear programming was using like just complex analysis.

</details>

**Speaker A**：但针对这些编码问题的方法，模型使用的则是表示论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Um but the method for these cases were using representation theory.

</details>

**Speaker B**：哦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Oh,

</details>

**Speaker A**：因为球面和超立方体都具有高度的对称性，而该证明的核心思想正是充分利用这种对称性。在原有的既有方法中其实已经包含了一定程度的对称性利用，但模型带来的实质性改进在于极深地引入了表示论，以更加精妙和高阶的方式将代数对称性融入其中。并且事实证明，根据表示论推导出的公式，如果你在球面码情形下取小球极限，你就能复现出一部分结果并还原出该数值。因此这个结果并非巧合孤立的特例，尽管从编码的角度来看你只推导了界的一个方向，但二者之间存在着非常紧密的内在联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: like both the sphere and the cube have a lot of symmetry and basically the idea of the proof was to really leverage this symmetry. Like there's some amount of this in the previous existing method and really the improvement is to lean into the representation theory like really hard and kind of make the algebraic symmetry enter in a more sophisticated way. And then it turns out that from the representation theory formulas, if you kind of take this small sphere limit in the spherical code case, you recover part of this result and you recover this value. So this result isn't a special case. You kind of only went one direction of the bound from looking at it from the code's point of view. But like there's like a very close connection.

</details>

**Speaker B**：原来是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Okay.

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah.

</details>

### 人机协作中的追问与数学直觉

**Speaker B**：明白。所以你们是让模型并行去跑这些问题，让它自主去发现，而不是由你们在过程中持续投喂线索？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. Yeah. So you guys let this like run in parallel. So it's like kind of discovering, or because you're not sort of like feeding it.

</details>

**Speaker A**：其实在这个特定的案例中，确实包含了一定程度的人机交互。这很有意思——除了这一对问题之外，其他所有问题基本上都是我们输入问题后，模型直接给出了完整的解法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: So actually this was the one case where there was some interactivity involved. Interesting. So for all of, so except for this pair, it was just, you know, we had some problems, we fed them in, and the model came back with some solutions.

</details>

**Speaker A**：但这里发生的事情非常有趣：我们起初只是要求它去改进编码理论中的界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Um what happened here was actually pretty interesting. So we first asked it to improve the bound for the codes.

</details>

**Speaker B**：嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Mhm.

</details>

**Speaker A**：模型给出了一个改进方案，其中运用了一定程度的表示论。接着我们就问它：“嘿，你能把这个思路推得更远一些吗？如果继续推下去会发生什么？”随后它返回了一个深奥复杂得多的表示论框架。结果表明，只要把该方法推到极致，就能从中自然推导出全空间球填充问题的猜想值！于是我们紧接着就要求它直接对这个对象进行分析，试图把整个理论图景补全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: And it came back with an improvement that like used some amount of representation theory. And then we kind of asked it, hey, can you like push this further, like you know what happens? And then it came back with some like much more sophisticated representation theory, and it turned out that you got this conjectured value for full space sphere packing out of that method by pushing it as far as it can go. So then we kind of ask to directly analyze the sky and try to complete the picture.

</details>

**Speaker B**：明白。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Okay.

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah.

</details>

**Speaker B**：所以这种关联绝对不是巧合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So the relationship isn't a coincidence.

</details>

**Speaker A**：对，绝非巧合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

### 脚手架、任务导向与模型的探索品味

**Speaker B**：这非常有意思。刚才你提到最开始的提示词非常基础，仅仅是问它“你能把这个推得更远吗？”这依然需要人类数学家的判断力。但长远来看，随着模型规模的扩展，大家会预期模型不再需要人类去推这一把；或者另一种观点认为，外部脚手架（Harness）与交互流程极为关键，这种追问本身就是脚手架机制的一部分。鉴于你们与 Astra 以及各代前沿模型的深度合作经验，你们如何看待人类输入/外部脚手架与模型内生能力之间的关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: It's like interesting when you're saying the first prompt, which is you know maybe so basic, which is like 'can you push this further?' It does require some judgment from mathematicians. But like eventually you would imagine by scaling the models you don't need to do that, or there's another view that the harness actually does matter, and this is kind of part of the harness apparatus. Do you guys have any views on that with your working with Astra, especially generations of models and how how much you have to kind of input or how much the harness matters versus not.

</details>

**Speaker A**：确实，我觉得模型会出现一些类似的有趣特质，这主要取决于你最初到底要求它做什么。在这个具体案例中，最初给模型的指令只是要求它将编码界改进一个指数因子，这主要体现为顶部的首项常数优化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I mean, yeah, I guess there have been some like funny quirks like this that just come from exactly what you asked the model to do basically. Like in this case, what the model was asked to do originally for codes was to improve the bounds by like some exponential factor. So it really shows up in this leading constant up here.

</details>

**Speaker B**：嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Mhm.

</details>

**Speaker A**：模型确实成功改进了界，完成之后它就不会主动去过度深挖。有时你确实能看到它主动深入，但有时它完成了给定的任务就停步了。当你再次提示它“继续深入”时，它就能走得更远。所以这根本不是能力上限的问题，只是它当时并没有自发去往那个方向探索而已。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Um and you know it improved the bounds and it didn't try to push things too much further. Like sometimes you see it do but sometimes it just doesn't bother, but yeah you know you just ask it again and it goes further. So it wasn't like a capabilities issue. It just kind of didn't feel like it at the time.

</details>

**Speaker B**：你觉得这应该被称为数学判断力（Judgment）吗？或者该怎么去定义这种特质？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Do you call that judgment or like what is the... because like there is a... Yeah. What do you call that?

</details>

**Speaker A**：我认为目前的模型倾向于高度的任务导向（Task-oriented）。如果你给它设定一个明确的任务，只要它达成了这个任务，它就感到非常满足并停在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I think models tend to be pretty task oriented. If you tell it to do a task and it accomplishes the task, it's pretty happy.

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的，关于这种任务导向性——我们是否能期望模型未来会跃升到更高的层次？并不是说它们会变得不擅长完成具体任务，而是它们能上升到拥有全局判断力的层次，懂得自主决定“不，我们应该往这个全新方向深入”。因为你们人类数学家拥有这种判断力，你们看到初步结果时会意识到：“这非常有前景，模型似乎运用了大量的表示论工具，而且目前看来并没有明显的上限瓶颈。”但模型本身当时并没有这种全局背景认知。我想说的是，尽管单看这一个案例可能很难外推，但回顾前几代模型，过去你们必须给予极多的提示词引导和复杂的脚手架干预，而后来需要的人工干预越来越少。这是否让你们确信模型能力正处于极为迅猛的上升通道中？在更宏观的层面上，解决一个高难度的数学难题，往往意味着必须同时拆解并攻克大量相对容易一些的子问题；而模型能够解决越来越难的数学问题，本身就证明它能够在单个连续的单元中承担越来越庞大且复杂的工作量。这确实显得前景十分光明。毕竟在任何严肃的数学证明中，都不可能仅凭单一灵感就能直达终点，你需要让多个板块相互交织、互相呼应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So yeah, like the task orientedness it's like but do we expect that level to kind of ascend up to... it's not that they will be less good at being task oriented. It's like they'll ascend to the level of like okay no let's let's go in this direction. You'll have the judgment because you guys had the judgment. You're like okay this is pretty promising. Looks like you're using a lot of representation theory. It doesn't seem like there's a limit so far. Um, but it doesn't have that context yet. But like I guess what I'm trying to say is like this one it's hard to maybe extra harder to extrapolate. But from like previous generations when you had to give it more maybe prompting more of that harness work but eventually you probably had to give it less. So it probably gives you some confidence that there's this like really fast ascension. And do you see, yeah, somehow solving a harder math problem is like you have to solve many smaller like somewhat less hard math problems and the fact that the math problems are getting harder is kind of an indication that you're the model is able to take on more and more work in like a single continuous unit. Um and I think that's that's the thing that looks very promising somehow like any of these solutions it's not like one idea and then you're kind of home free. You need several pieces to kind of interact and talk to each other. And

</details>

**Speaker B**：而且模型并非瞬间一次性构想出所有思路，对吧？它无法在一瞬间凭空把所有环节完整导出。模型需要去观察这一模块如何与另一模块相互作用，而这种模块间的协同与组合本身就是一个需要攻克的难题，或者说需要将众多子问题拼装在一起。因此，有没有可能当你们提示它“把这个推得更远”时，这种提示的量级其实就等同于它在内部求解的所有微小步骤之一？所以你并不觉得这是一种特权式的人工方向指引，而只像是“顺手推了它一把”；或者你其实认为这里面存在着更根本的问题——我想探讨的更宏大问题是：模型是否具备了真正的科研“品味”（Taste）？因为当人们谈论模型在自主科研（Research）方面取得多大进展时，我们期待的正是某种程度的递归自我改进（RSI）；而关于这种能力的演进既有令人惊叹的飞跃，也有人会觉得“或许在现阶段它还……”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: the models I the model doesn't come up with all the ideas at once, right? It doesn't pull everything out of in in an instance of kind of the fact that it needs to sort of see how this piece interacts with another piece. That's kind of like solving a problem in itself or piecing together many problems in itself. It could just be that okay when you're telling it okay push this even further that was of the same order of like magnitude as like all the smaller things it's solving as well in between and so you don't think that's kind of like a privilege direction it's just sort of like hey let's give it like one one more help or you actually think that there's I guess what I'm trying to get at a bigger question is like is there a good sense of like you know taste because like when people talk about for instance how well the models are getting at like um doing research for instance that's what we you know we want a little bit of RSI um and and sort of like there's surprising things about how that improves and then there's like the oh you know maybe right now it's

### 模型能力演进与学术“品味”的功利主义定义

**Speaker A**：在当前阶段，模型的感觉依然有点像初级研究员——并不能真正提出恰当的问题。因此，我很想了解一下，随着每一代模型的演进与突破，你是在哪些具体维度上看到这种进展的？或者说，到底什么才算得上是所谓的“学术品味”（Taste）？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...at a level of still like a junior researcher, it's like not really asking like the right problems. And so I'm just trying to get like a maybe a sense of like where you're seeing that progress through the model advancements each generation. I mean, what is taste even?

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的，我认为我对“品味”的看法倾向于相当功利主义。如果你能够通过做出更明智的判断来更快地解决问题，我认为这就是衡量品味的最佳通用指标。而且从某种程度上说，能够解决难度更高的问题，在定义上就意味着它拥有更好的品味。

我认为偶尔——因为当前的模型是以具体任务为导向的——你确实会看到类似这样的迹象：模型显然已经取得了某种突破，它在某种程度上也意识到自己取得了突破，但随后它并没有完全将其推向极致，因为那并不是你最初要求它做的事情。不过，与我们迄今为止所看到的整体进展态势相比，这种现象似乎相当次要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah, I think I tend to be pretty utilitarian in my view of taste. And like if you're able to solve problems faster by making better judgments, like I think that's like the best general proxy I have for taste. And somehow the fact that solving harder problems means it has, kind of by definition, means it has better taste.

I think occasionally, because they are task-oriented, you do occasionally get these symptoms of like: "Oh, it clearly has made a breakthrough, it kind of understands it's made a breakthrough, and then it doesn't kind of push all the way to the limit because that's not what you asked." But that seems rather minor compared to the state of progress we've seen so far.

</details>

**Speaker A**：好的，明白了，这非常清晰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Okay, yeah. I think it's a pretty clear...

</details>

**Speaker B**：我认为如果你试图让同一个模型既去执行具体的长周期复杂任务，同时又展现出宏观的品味，它可能会陷入混乱。但如果你有一个专门负责宏观品味与方向把控的模型，另外还有一个模型专门负责深入底层、长期专注于攻克具体难题——就像作为监督型 AI 的下属执行者一样——我觉得在当前架构下这种分工是完全可行的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Like, I think maybe you're liable to get confused if you're trying to like do a concrete long horizon task and show taste kind of at the same time. But like, you know, if you have like one model that's responsible for taste and one model that's responsible for going out and working for a long time at solving a hard problem—kind of as the underling of the supervising AI—I feel like that's kind of going to be fine currently.

</details>

### 双层模型架构、执行框架与智能的本质

**Speaker A**：噢，这很有意思。因为你的意思相当于是在说，这两个模块即使不是完全独立的，至少也不应该互相污染彼此的上下文。在我看来，这可能是一个比预期更强的论断。

这确实非常耐人寻味。沿着你提到的功利主义视角来看，解决越来越难的问题绝不仅仅意味着进行暴力搜索，而是在不断做出抉择。它相当于从极其庞大的潜在路径空间中进行高效剪枝，筛选出一条既切实可行、但在整个解空间中占比极小的精准路径。

然而，为什么会需要一个单独的模型、独立生成的实例，或者另一个模型版本来提供这种“品味”呢？或者说这种假设本身过于抽象、脱离实际？我们是否应该直接让实际系统自行演进？

与此相关的一个核心问题是：究竟是什么推动我们获得更高阶的智能？是外围框架（Harness）与基础模型的结合，还是仅仅取决于模型本身？我们在实际应用 AI 或初创公司的实践中经常能看到这种拉锯：你确实需要外围框架，但当换上全新一代的模型时，原有的框架往往适应得很差，因为有时极其精简的最小化框架反而是释放模型原生能力的最优解。

但与此同时，现在的训练体系又要求将框架与模型紧密结合进行针对性训练。这一方面可能是出于商业壁垒考虑，增加专有性以防止他人轻易复现；但另一方面，或许也确实是为了更好地控制我们所关心的推理轨迹（Reasoning Traces）。

绕了这么一大圈，我想表达的是：看到模型在数学能力上的飞速提升确实令人惊叹。而像“品味”这样极其抽象、难以捉摸的概念，或许正是我们抽丝剥茧、搞清楚核心关键要素的有效切入点。

我对此唯一非显然的体会是：当一个人在专注于某项任务时，常常会陷入思维定势，埋头苦干却走入死胡同；此时只要有一个朋友站在身后看一眼，随口问一句……

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Oh, interesting. Because that is like saying that these two things are somewhat, if not separate, at least they shouldn't kind of pollute each other's contexts, which is a little bit... I mean it could be potentially like a stronger statement than I guess.

Yeah, it's just kind of interesting because it might just be like to your point: let's take the utilitarian answer, solving harder and harder problems is doing a lot more than just brute forcing something. It's making choices. It's like pruning a vastly large space of possible paths into something that's like really... both tractable, but then ends up being a diminishingly small path within that space.

Um, but like why would a separate model, a separate generation, or something that's a different version of the model contribute to taste? Or maybe that's totally too abstract and doesn't make any sense, and we should just let the actual... This might lead to the related question: what is the thing that gets us to a better version of intelligence—the harness and the model, or is it just the model?

And it's like we see this, at least in applied AI or startups, where it's a continual battle: you need the harness, but then the harness adapts very poorly to a new model, because sometimes a very minimal harness is still the best way to expose the raw power of the model. But then now we also have these training regimes where we require the harness to be trained with it. I mean, maybe part of this is to keep things more proprietary and harder for other people to use, but I think partially it's maybe actually that it helps have more control on like the reasoning traces you care about.

It's a long rambling way of saying: this is so interesting to see how the models have gotten better at math, and maybe something that's like very abstract and hard to describe like taste is a way to tease out like what is actually necessary here.

I think my only like non-trivial thought here is that like when you're working—I mean just when you're doing any task—occasionally you get pigeonholed and you like work really hard, and just having a friend look over your shoulder and be like...

### 学术品味、直觉与索菲克群（Sofic Groups）的数学背景

**Speaker A**：但我认为很大一部分“品味”还在于能够敏锐地预判：你自己或者你构想中的某种特定方法，究竟擅长解决哪些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: But I think a lot of taste is also like having a sense of what problems you or like some method you have in mind are going to be good at solving.

</details>

**Speaker B**：嗯，确实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Mhm.

</details>

**Speaker A**：当然，这其中肯定包含某种纯粹的审美取向；但同时也包含一种学术直觉——清楚自己应该去探索什么方向才能切实取得进展。按常理推断，当系统越来越擅长完成各类复杂任务时，这种直觉也会作为一种副产品自然而然地涌现出来，对吧？

另外，如果你愿意的话，我们随时可以进入关于索菲克群（Sofic Groups）的讨论，这绝对是一个超级吸引人的数学话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Like it's... I mean certainly there's some amount of like absolute aesthetic point, right? But there's also just like you know having a nose for what what you might want to pursue because you'll be able to make progress. Um and you know I think for that like there's you know you would expect that as a side product of being good at completing tasks you would you would get there sort of, right?

Let me know if we still want to do like a section on sofic groups because I think you know up to you guys it's definitely super interesting.

</details>

**Speaker B**：好的，那么第一个问题或许是：什么是“群”（Group）？我们先来回顾一下基础定义。

在数学上，群是一个配备了某种乘法运算的元素集合。本质上，这是数学家形式化描述“对称性”（Symmetry）的方式。

具体来说，如果 $g$ 和 $h$ 是群中的元素，那么它们的乘积 $gh$ 也是群中某个明确良定义的元素。群运算满足结合律（Associativity）；群中存在单位元（Identity）；并且对于群中的每一个元素 $g$，都存在唯一的逆元（Inverse）。

总的来说，群是对各种操作复合（Composing Operations）的一种高度抽象。这些操作可以是具体的数字运算、矩阵乘法，也可以是几何物体的旋转变换（旋转本身实际上就是矩阵乘法的一种特例）。

群可以分为有限群（Finite Groups）和无限群（Infinite Groups）。例如，如果你有一个正方形，它的所有旋转对称操作构成一个仅包含 4 个元素的有限群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So maybe the the first question is what is a group? Let's remind ourselves.

So uh a group is uh a set of elements with some multiplication operation. And uh basically this is how mathematicians think about symmetry. So, so you're like basically like if G and H are elements of your group, then GH has some is some other well-defined uh element of your group and you have like uh associativity uh and you have an inverse. So for every G there's some inverse uh and there's some like specific element in the group that uh is is kind of the identity.

Uh okay so you know it's it's some like abstraction of like uh composing operations. So these could be like numbers they could be like multiplying matrices they could be like like rotating something which is you know a special case of multiplying matrices.

Um and uh groups that can be finite or infinite. So like you know um if if you have like a square like all the rotations of it form a group with like four elements.

</details>

**Speaker A**：而如果是一个圆，它的所有旋转操作构成的群则包含不可数无穷多个元素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: If you have like a circle then the rotations form a group with like uncountably many elements.

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的。而索菲克群要么是有限群，要么是可数群。通常情况下，你可以将它们想象为可数无限群，也就是说它的元素个数与整数集合的基数相同。

从直观意义上讲，一个群如果被称为“索菲克群”（Sofic Group），意味着它在某种意义上可以通过一系列有限群来进行近似逼近。

长期以来，数学界一直不知道是否存在“非索菲克群”（Non-sofic Group）。因此，Astra 所证明的里程碑成果……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Um and uh so sofic groups are either finite or countable. You should think of them as being countably infinite. So there's like the same number of elements as like the integers.

and uh it's sofic if in some sense uh it can be uh approximated by finite groups. So we didn't know if there was a non-sofic group. So so the the the result that uh Astra proved...

</details>

**Speaker A**：……就是直接证明了：确实存在非索菲克群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: ...is simply that uh there exists a non-sofic group.

</details>

### 有限逼近的极限与非索菲克群反例的意义

**Speaker B**：没错。在深入探讨具体证明细节之前，我觉得数学史上的很多重大研究纲领都体现了这样一种思想：“作为人类，我们本质上是有限的造物，那么不妨看看我们的有限逼近方法究竟能走多远。”

在这个问题上——尤其对于可数群的情况——它可能与 Elek-Szabó 或 Aldous-Lyons 的理论密切相关。这有助于建立一个直观认知：如果所有群都能被有限近似（即所有群都是索菲克群），那将是一个多么美妙的结论，而且这个假设看起来也合情合理。因此，我非常期待听听它究竟是如何找到反例的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. And without like I mean we can you know before going to to that proof it is like you know it's like I feel like a lot of the programs of math is like okay we are such finite creatures let's see how well our finite approximations are you know uh do.

and in this case especially for the countable case it's like maybe you'll be relating it to like the Aldous-Lyons thing. It's just like it helps kind of anchor the picture of like it seems like such a I mean it's a nice result if it were true, but it it's not and it seems almost like reasonable. And so yeah, I I actually didn't um didn't uh go I would love to hear the explanation of like how it it found a counter example.

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的，过去人们之所以一直期望不存在非索菲克群——即每一个群都能进行这种有限近似——在某种程度上就像是在期盼奇迹的发生。

因为事实证明，具有索菲克性质的群拥有许多极其优秀的数学性质。针对有限群成立的某些数学证明，可以直接借助索菲克群定义所允许的逼近方式推广到无限情形，从而顺利得出结论。

例如，数学中有一个概念叫做“满射群”（Surjunctive Groups）。有一个著名定理指出：任何索菲克群都必然是满射群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, I mean I I would say that like you know the the hope that there was no non-sofic group so every group has this kind of approximation like maybe this is sort of like people hoping that there's a miracle

because uh it turns out that groups like this have a lot of nice properties um because uh you can run certain proofs for finite groups and then uh you know kind of approximate them in whatever way the definition of being sofic lets you approximate them and get the result.

So, so like um there's this notion of being a surjunctive group. So there's uh there's some fact that uh any uh group which is sofic is uh also surjunctive.

</details>

<!-- chunk 7/8 -->

### 群论动力系统与索菲克群猜想的起源

**Speaker A**: 类似地，亚满射性（surjunctivity）是群上动力系统的一种性质。我想最初的问题在于，是否每一个群都是亚满射群（surjunctive group）。这是 Gottschalk 在 20 世纪 70 年代提出的一个问题。而这种“先针对有限群进行证明，然后再进行有限逼近”的论证模式，正是引发“是否存在非索菲克群（non-sofic group）”这一疑问的最初动机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Surjunctive is some property of dynamical systems on the group. And I guess the original question was whether every group is surjunctive. This is some question of Gottschalk from the 70s. And this fact follows this pattern of: prove it for finite groups and then do this approximation. That is what motivated the question about whether there's a non-sofic group.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 嗯，也许我可以稍微谈谈 Aldous-Lyons 猜想……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Mhm. Yeah, maybe I'll say a little bit about this Aldous-Lyons conjecture and...

</details>

**Speaker A**: 当然，请讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, sure, yeah, yeah.

</details>

### Aldous-Lyons 猜想与有限图逼近

**Speaker B**: 我想我之前听说过这个猜想，因为在概率论中存在一个相关的、更强的猜想，由 Aldous 和 Lyons 推广普及。这个猜想大致是指：任何具有某种良好性质（即所谓的幺模性，unimodularity）的无限图——或者说一个幺模随机图（unimodular random graph）——都可以用大型有限图来逼近。

如果不深入探讨具体的数学细节，解释这类命题内涵的最佳方式，就是看它们在整数集上意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So I guess I had heard of this a little bit beforehand because there's a related stronger conjecture in probability that was made popular by Aldous and Lyons. This conjecture roughly says that any infinite graph with some nice property called unimodularity—a unimodular random graph—can be approximated by large finite graphs. So maybe the way to explain what these kinds of things are trying to say without getting into technical weeds is to say what they mean about the integers.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 那么，我们该如何将整数集画成一张图呢？这被称为凯莱图（Cayley graph），你只需把最近邻的数连接起来。在某种规范意义上，这就是代表整数集的图。而且在某种意义上，你可以用有限图来逼近它。为什么呢？如果你观察模 $n$ 的整数，就会得到类似的图景，只不过它是一个大圆圈，而不是一条无限长的直线。

关键在于，如果你观察无限直线上的任意一点以及有限圆圈上的任意一点，它们局部的邻域结构看起来是完全相同的。你必须走到非常远的地方，才能看清其全局几何结构其实是一个圆圈而非一条直线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So how would I draw the integers as a graph? This is called a Cayley graph; you're just going to connect nearest neighbors. Okay, so there's some kind of canonical way in which this is the graph that represents the integers. And there's some sense in which you can approximate this by finite graphs. Why? Well, if you look at integers mod $n$, then you kind of get the same picture, but you have a big circle instead of an infinite line. And the point is if you look at any point here and any point here, nearby things look the same. You have to go very far away to kind of see this global geometric structure that you have a circle and not a line.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Mhm.

</details>

### 索菲克逼近与两类猜想的关联

**Speaker B**: 事实上，整数群和模 $n$ 整数群都是群，其运算分别就是普通的数相加或模 $n$ 相加。因此，这些模 $n$ 整数构成了整个整数群的索菲克逼近（sofic approximations）。这种局部逼近的性质，正是整数群属于索菲克群的原因。

“每一个群都是索菲克群”这一断言，可以说是这种利用有限群逼近无限群性质的某种推广。而 Aldous-Lyons 猜想则是一个更宽泛的猜想，它认为对任何网络都可以进行类似逼近，且大致上不需要那么多的代数结构约束。所以它是一个适用范围更广的猜想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And in fact, the integers and integers mod $n$ are both groups, just by adding numbers or adding numbers mod $n$. So these integers mod $n$ are sofic approximations for the full integers. This approximation is kind of why the integers are a sofic group. So the statement that every group is sofic is sort of a generalization of the fact that you can do this approximation with groups. And this Aldous-Lyons conjecture is kind of a broader conjecture that for any network you can do this, and you don't require as much algebraic structure, roughly. So it's kind of a broader conjecture.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 大约两年前，这个猜想被证伪了。那是一项真正意义上的力作（tour de force），长达 250 页，建立在先前另一篇 200 页工作的基础之上。它运用了量子复杂性理论（quantum complexity theory）等深奥工具，搭建了一座极其复杂的桥梁。我认为当时能够完全读懂它的人少之又少。既然这是一个更强的猜想，那么证伪它在逻辑强度上就弱于证伪“所有群都是索菲克群”的命题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: So this conjecture was disproved earlier, like two years ago, and it was kind of a real tour de force work—like 250 pages building on another 200 pages. It uses quantum complexity theory, so it really builds this very complicated bridge, and I think not very many people could understand this. Right. So since this is a stronger conjecture, the disproof is weaker than disproving this statement that all groups are sofic.

</details>

### 短小精悍的直接证明与构造差异

**Speaker B**: 但事实证明，直接证明“存在非索菲克群”的论文要简短、容易得多，与证伪 Aldous-Lyons 猜想那项令人惊叹的浩瀚工作截然不同。它大约只有 15 页左右，完全没有涉及与量子复杂性之间那种极其繁复的关联，而是基本上始终保持在纯粹的群论领域内部。虽然它确实借用了其他数学家（比如 Kun 和 Thom 等人）已有的重要成果，但总体而言，它是一篇非常合理、规范的数学证明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: But it turns out that the direct proof that there's a non-sofic group was much shorter and easier than this really amazing disproof of the Aldous-Lyons conjecture. It's like 15 pages maybe, and it doesn't have any of this very complicated connection with quantum complexity. It just kind of stays in group theory land. I mean, it uses some important existing results by other mathematicians like Kun and Thom, but it's like a very reasonable, normal kind of proof.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的。也许这是在陈述显而易见的事实，但索菲克群命题与它之间的关联，正是在于你取群的凯莱图，而那恰恰就是他们在 Aldous-Lyons 猜想中所研究的对象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. And kind of spelling out the obvious, but the connection between the sofic group statement is just you take the Cayley graph, and that's the one that they use for Aldous-Lyons.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 所以这就是为什么群的情况可以看作其中的一个子集……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. And so that's why it's like a subset of...

</details>

**Speaker B**: 对，基本机制就是这样。对于任意一个群，你可以精确地构建出它的凯莱图：选取一组生成元，然后将相邻的元素连接起来。在这个例子中，这就是整数群的凯莱图。

当你从一个群出发时，你得到的是一张确定性的图——单一一整张图，固定了一组生成元。而 Aldous-Lyons 猜想之所以更强，本质上是因为它允许研究范围扩展到非确定性的图网络。它允许图具有随机性，只需满足某种额外的幺模性质来严格约束其随机方式即可。

这就是二者的核心区别。在索菲克群的问题中，你必须给出一个确定性的网络，而不是随机网络。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Right. So basically what happens is for a group you can take exactly a Cayley graph: you take some elements that generate the group and you kind of connect elements that are adjacent. So in this case, this is a Cayley graph of the integers. Right, so when you do that from a group you get a deterministic graph—you just get a single graph once you fix some set of generators. So this conjecture is stronger basically because it allows a broader set of graphs that aren't deterministic. It allows them to be random, but have some extra unimodularity property that constrains exactly how it can be random. But basically that's the difference. Here you kind of have to give a deterministic network instead of a random one.

</details>

### AI 辅助数学证明的特点与组合学阻碍

**Speaker A**: 明白。对于这个结果，有什么令人意外或值得玩味的地方吗？我是指，你之前提到它的一些特点，比如整个证明技术都严格保留在群论框架内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. Anything kind of interesting or surprising about the result? I mean, you mentioned some things, which is like it stayed within group theory techniques.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 我觉得它可能是当前 AI 生成数学定理普遍特征的一个极佳范例：到目前为止，AI 给出的反例证明通常都非常简短。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: I mean, I think maybe it's like a nice example of this general pattern that theorems produced by AI have generally been—like the proofs are pretty short generally, like with the counterexamples so far.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 确实如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 是的。尽管它本质上是一个反例构造，但要完成分析，你必须处理一些复杂的环节。这里的难点在于，“索菲克群”这一性质非常抽象，难以直接抓住其本质特征。因此，你必须找到一种具体的表述方式，构建出一套能够断言“这个群绝不可能是索菲克群”的判别方法。

最终的证明实际上非常短。它几乎可以算作一个组合学论证，但却是一个极其微妙、精细的组合论证。模型不知怎的，不仅需要提出正确的前提命题，清楚文献中已经具备了哪些拼图碎片，还要将整个逻辑链条无误地执行下去——这确实非常精彩。

这个问题的艰深之处正在于，要直接把握“能否被任意有限结构所逼近”这一条件是极其困难的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah, but I mean this one, it's sort of a counterexample, but there's some stuff you have to do to analyze things. The difficult part here is that the property of being a sofic group is not so easy to get your hands on. So you have to find a concrete way of producing a way of saying this group cannot be sofic. And the proof is actually very short. It's almost a combinatorics argument, but it's a very, very delicate combinatorics argument. And the model somehow needed to both have the right statement and know what pieces exist in the literature, and then execute it correctly, and that's very nice. The difficulty of this problem is that it's just very hard to get your hands on being approximated by any possible finite structure.

</details>

### 事后复盘与数学社区的跟进

**Speaker A**: 我正想问，在那个可数无穷的层面上，究竟发生了什么才抵御了这种有限逼近？你们在做“事后复盘”（postmortem）时——比如要求模型解释背后的机制——有得到直观的理解吗？它给出了令人满意的解释吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I was going to say, what is happening at that countable infinity that's resisting this approximation? Did it give a sense of that when you do a postmortem, when you're like, "Okay, Astra, explain to me what is the..."?

</details>

**Speaker B**: 哦，是的，我们确实做了详尽的复盘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Oh yeah, we did that all right.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 那么从它那里得到的解释是什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: What was a good explanation you got out of it?

</details>

**Speaker B**: 我认为其中存在着某种具体的组合学阻碍（combinatorial obstruction）。这虽然很难用一两句话解释清楚，但确实存在一个明确的组合障碍。如果你阅读先前的文献，就会意识到这正是前人未能完全排除的盲区。而模型找到了一种方法，指出只要引入这一额外的代数事实，那种诡异的“协同串通”（conspiracy）就绝不可能发生。它的目标非常明确，就是为了排除先前作者在隐式论述中所担忧的协同现象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: I think there's some concrete combinatorial obstruction. It's hard to explain, but there's some concrete combinatorics obstruction which, if you read the previous papers, you realize that that's what they couldn't rule out. And Astra found a way to say, "Okay, no, if you add this one extra algebraic fact, this weird conspiracy can't happen." It's very clearly trying to rule out conspiracy that the previous authors had implicitly written about.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 事实证明，前人锁定的那些怀疑对象确实是正确的。他们的大方向是对的，而模型完成了这“最后一英里”的冲刺——不论你如何去量化这一步的难度。

但要是放在一年前，如果有人告诉我所有这些 AI 生成的数学证明都会如此简短且优雅，我一定会感到非常吃惊。大家之前可能会担心 AI 会生成动辄上千页人类根本无法理解的庞杂内容，但实际情况恰恰相反。目前看来，只有人类才会写出 200 页的证明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: And those were the actual suspects, it turned out. So they were sort of on the right track, and then this did the last mile of—well, however you quantify that. But I think, like a year ago, I would have been very surprised to learn that all of these AI proofs are very short and elegant. You're kind of afraid that they're going to generate all these thousand-page things and you're never going to be able to understand it. But it's been kind of the opposite. Only humans can generate 200-page proofs right now.

</details>

**Speaker A**: 是的。而且我之前也想问，做这种事后复盘往往能激发更多的数学新思想，因为在人类合作中，正是这种深挖催生了新的数学。如果稍微调整一下提示词，比如问它“你会如何推广这个结论”，我不确定你们是否使用过这种技术，让模型去进一步探索并利用它已经建立的成果？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. Well, and also doing that postmortem ends up usually engendering more mathematics because when you do that with humans, that's what breeds new mathematics. So maybe if you alter the prompt a little bit and be like, "How would you generalize this?" or something like that... I don't know if that's been a technique for you guys to have it explore and exploit what it has already developed.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 嗯，其实已经有后续的研究跟进了，是由这项研究所依托的原作者 Thom 他们开展的。所以数学界已经在积极跟进了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Well, there has been followup on this already, actually by Thom, on whose work this was built. So they...

</details>

**Speaker A**: 数学界正在逐步跟进介入。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: The math community is coming on.

</details>

**Speaker B**: 是的，没错，而这正是我们所期望看到的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is kind of what we're hoping, right?

### 数学界对 AI 的接纳与合作演进

**Speaker A**：你知道的，我们自己并不想去写大量的后续跟进论文。但如果能出现一些有趣的后续研究，进一步拓展这些核心思想，并在本次研究的背景下给出更多非收缩群（non-systolic groups）的具体范例，我们会感到非常高兴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: You know, we don't want to be writing lots of follow-up papers ourselves, but if there's some interesting follow-up building out these ideas more and giving more examples of non-systolic groups in this case, we're very, very happy that there's that follow-up.

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的。这正好引出了一个绝佳的话题：数学界应当以何种理想方式来吸收并接纳这些成果？因为在当下一线数学家中，大家的态度可以说各不相同。目前大多数人大概都会承认：“好吧，AI 显然正在做出一些非凡的工作，如果不在自己的工作流中引入它，将会是一种劣势。”不过我也确实听说过一些情况，有些人很难接受将 AI 列为论文合著者，或者对这种模式下究竟该如何进行贡献署名感到困惑。但如果从更乐观的角度来看——正如你刚才所说，你们希望数学家能够在此类结果的基础上继续构建。AI 确实会生成大量有待人类检验的结果，这无疑给整个数学社区和学术界带来了压力。那么，你们预期数学家对 AI 的接纳以及双方的合作模式会如何演进？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. Well, actually maybe that's a great segue into what's the ideal way that this is being taken up by the math community. Because I feel like there's a spectrum of answers from working mathematicians. Some—probably most at this point—are like: "Okay, AI is obviously doing some non-trivial stuff. It would be a disadvantage not to admit that in my workflow." I've definitely heard some stories where people would find it hard to either take AI as a co-author, or like how do you even do kind of attribution this way? But to paint the more optimistic picture: you're saying you want the mathematicians to be building on these results. It definitely generates a lot more results to be verified. So it puts pressure on the community and the profession. How do you expect the evolution of uptake and collaboration with mathematicians?

</details>

**Speaker A**：我的意思是，模型能够生成高深复杂的数学成果这一事实，本身就意味着它们同样能帮助你理解高深的数学。比如我自己偶尔也喜欢浏览 arXiv 预印本网站去琢磨某些证明。过去我可能会去读论文的引言，但现在的实际做法要快得多：直接把 PDF 上传到我最常用的模型里，让它梳理出大致的证明策略。这种方式极大地提升了效率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I mean, given the fact that the models can produce sophisticated mathematics means that they can help you understand sophisticated mathematics. Occasionally I enjoy looking at the arXiv and I want to understand some proof. I could read the introduction, but in practice it's just much faster to take the PDF, put it into my favorite model, and get an output of what the rough proof strategy is.

</details>

**Speaker C**：当然，模型不仅会帮我们呈指数级生成更多数学成果，更让吸收和理解这些数学变得容易得多。眼下人机交互之间可能还需要一些来回调试，但至少对我而言，借助模型去理解一段数学内容，要比完全不用模型快得多。因此，它在带来大量待消化内容的同时，本身也在协助解决它所带来的这一挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker C**: Of course, models are going to help us produce exponentially more mathematics, but they also make it much easier to absorb it. And right now, okay, it's still a bit of a challenge back and forth, but I think for me at least, it's much, much faster to understand a piece of mathematics with a model than without it. So it's helping solve the problem it creates anyways.

### 数学研究范式重塑与参与门槛的降低

**Speaker B**：确实，我深有同感。我并不觉得这会构成多么严重的问题。当然，我没有评教职（tenure）之类的学术包袱，所以没有那么大的现实压力。我非常赞同降低数学门槛这一点。如果我不需要耗费海量时间去生啃某个全新领域的材料，我就可以把它丢给 ChatGPT，或者期待你们即将发布给大众使用的更强大模型。我认为这其中最积极的一面在于，能够让更多人参与到数学研究中来。人们可以带着各异的直觉跨界进入，并且真正有可能产出优质的数学成果。这是否更接近你们所希望推动的愿景？或者说，你们认为应当警惕哪些问题，以便足够迅速地适应并充分利用 AI 带来的优势？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah, I feel like that at least. I don't view it as creating much more of a problem, but again, I don't have such high stakes in like, okay, whether I'm going to get tenure, etc. So I agree with making it more accessible. If I'm not spending so much time absorbing an area, I can put it into ChatGPT and then expect to—I mean, you guys have an even more powerful model hopefully releasing for other people to enjoy as well. But the positive version of that is actually more people can participate in mathematics. People might be coming with other intuitions and they could actually maybe generate good mathematics. Is that sort of closer to the vision of what you're hoping this is pushing towards? Or what things do you think to be wary of to adapt fast enough to take advantage of AI?

</details>

**Speaker A**：是的，我认为未来肯定会发生巨变。在数学领域，一项研究成果的成立包含很多重要环节：既需要有人提出这一成果，也需要有人去理解、吸收并将其内化，进而在此基础上展开更多探索，搞清楚它在人类整体知识体系中的坐标。而在几年前，证明某个数学结果极其困难，以至于其他环节都被附带绑定在了一起——如果你凭一己之力证出了某个命题，你自然会对它理解得非常透彻，在某种意义上你就顺理成章地负责维护它并向其他人讲解。而现在，曾经作为核心瓶颈的“证明过程”不再那么难以逾越，知识组织、理解和传播等其他层面的约束便凸显了出来。因此，未来组织和梳理数学知识的最佳架构可能会截然不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah, I think certainly there will be a lot of changes, right? In math, there are a lot of things that are kind of important for a given result, right? You need someone to come up with it, but you also need people to understand and absorb it, internalize it enough to do more with it, and figure out where it fits into humanity's understanding. A couple of years ago, proving the result was so hard that kind of the other stuff was just coming along for the ride. If you manage to prove this thing yourself, you're automatically going to understand it quite well. You're kind of responsible for maintaining it in some sense and explaining it to other people. And now, what was the main bottleneck before is kind of much less of a bottleneck, and these other constraints come into play. So the optimal structuring for organizing the knowledge could look rather different.

</details>

**Speaker B**：具体会变成什么样呢？这是否会让数学这门学科变得更加经验主义（empirical）？大家是不是会把精力放在以前稀缺的硬核推理之外？我并不是说经验化有什么不好，但这几乎让它运作起来像一门完全不同的学科了。毕竟数学的很多乐趣恰恰在于理解本身。那么，理解、沟通、整合框架，以及保持人类独有的审美鉴赏力，是否仍将是稀缺且宝贵的核心价值？当下的数学家是否需要据此调整自身的定位并重塑评价与激励机制？还是说这种描述过于脸谱化，实际情况会是别的样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. How does that look? Does this make the field a lot more kind of empirical? Will people do sort of the hard—the first thing that was scarce, which is like all the reasoning—and then... Not that it's a bad thing to make it empirical, but it's almost like it functions as a very different discipline. A lot of the fun stuff is understanding, and so understanding, communicating, maybe assembling, having still the human taste—does that sort of remain rarified, and is that how current mathematicians need to adapt and reward contributions? Or is this too much of a caricature and it's something else?

</details>

**Speaker C**：我认为，随着我们积累的数学成果越来越多，懂得如何将它们置于恰当的理论框架中，并能够清晰地解释给其他同行以促成共赏，必然会变得极为关键。过去我们虽然内隐地看重这一点，但通常是因为最初证明定理的那个人顺便把理解带给了大家。而在未来，这会越来越体现为一种独立职能：由人类专家去把这些深奥的认知传递给他人并提供指导。这种集体层面的共同理解，过去在数学研究中往往是隐性的，未来将日益成为这门学科中更加显性且具有极高价值的重要部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker C**: I think certainly understanding how to put—as we get more and more mathematics—put it in a proper framework, and being able to explain it to other humans so that they can also appreciate it. Somehow implicitly we valued this, but it was usually because you were the person proving the result that gave everybody else the understanding. But I think increasingly it would be a function of: you're the human who can sort of give this understanding to other people and help them with it. More of that communal understanding was much more implicit in how we view math in general, but I think it will be an increasingly more explicit and valuable part of the subject.

### 重大数学谜题、应用前景与总结致谢

**Speaker A**：数学有一点非常美妙，那就是数学难题的难度上限极高。因此，即使 AI 在数学能力上持续呈现指数级提升，我们也很可能依然无法彻底攻克像 P vs NP 这样的世纪难题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: A nice thing about math is that the ceiling for difficulty of a math problem is pretty high. So even if AI continues getting exponentially better at math, it's plausible we'll never solve something like P versus NP.

</details>

**Speaker C**：而且数学界的研究焦点可能会随之转移，变得更加专注于探索这些重大的未解之谜，而减少在那些偏常规的次要问题上的精力消耗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker C**: And it could be that the field kind of becomes more attached to these big mysteries and less to smaller mysteries that are more like routine.

</details>

**Speaker B**：是的，我认为那是一个非常令人向往的前景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Yeah. I think that's a positive vision.

</details>

**Speaker A**：而且在我的生命中，有些数学谜题我曾花了数月甚至数年的时间去苦思冥想却始终不得其解……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: I mean also, there are things I spent like months or years of my life wondering about not getting to know...

</details>

**Speaker B**：一旦能见证答案揭晓，那是多么巨大的喜悦啊！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: What a joy when we get them!

</details>

**Speaker A**：是啊，其中一部分谜题我终将能够获知答案，光是想到这一点就让我感到非常欣慰和兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. Some portion of them I'll get to know the answer to. I'm pretty happy about that.

</details>

**Speaker B**：确实如此。我对这种数学成果与深度理解迎来的全面复兴感到无比振奋。数学本身就是一个无限广阔的领域，这里绝无夸大其词，你能在这里创造的东西实在太丰富了。特别是对于像我这样无法把全职精力投入到专业数学研究中的人来说，现在在数学实践中能够施展拳脚的空间变得广阔得多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Exactly. No, I'm excited about this renaissance of results and understanding. I feel like this is such an infinite field—no pun intended—there's just so much that you can actually create here. Especially for somebody like me who's not going to have the time to actually practice mathematics, now there's a lot more that you can actually do in the activity of math.

</details>

**Speaker A**：没错。非全职从事数学研究的人去理解前沿进展、探究他们心中好奇已久的数学奥秘的能力，将会得到大幅提升。此外，如果你在从事其他工作时需要用到某些高深数学，你不再需要专门去满世界寻找该领域的顶尖专家才能将其实际应用到自己的项目中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: Yeah. I think the ability of someone who's not working on math as their literal job all the time to understand what's going on and learn about some of the mysteries they might have wondered about will go up quite a lot. Also, if you're working on something that requires some math, suddenly you don't need to find a world expert on this topic to be able to use it in your own work.

</details>

**Speaker B**：数学家们可要多包涵了！不过这确实是事实。过去能够精通这些专门数学并提供支持的人才实在太稀缺了，因此这项技术非常有帮助。它可能会对理论物理学产生积极推动，未来大家拭目以待，同时也会惠及众多其他应用领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker B**: Sorry, mathematicians! Yeah, no, it's true. I mean, I think there was just like a dearth of actual people who could do that and so I think this is helpful. Maybe it's helpful for theoretical physics. We'll see. But a lot of other applied areas as well.

</details>

**Speaker A**：如果应用数学的发展步伐能够大幅加快，对整个世界而言都将是一件幸事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker A**: It'd be nice for the world if applied mathematics went a lot faster.

</details>

**Speaker B**：完全赞同，我也持同样的看法。非常感谢二位今天的加入！这场交流非常愉快，看到模型取得如此巨大的进展令人无比振奋。期待很快能再次邀请你们来对谈。

<details>
