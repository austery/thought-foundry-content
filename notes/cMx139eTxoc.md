### 致命的奇迹材料

**Gregor**: 它们无处不在。哇，这个真的好蓝。你应该过来看看，这太蓝了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: They're just everywhere. Whoa, this is really blue. You should come look, this is so blue.

</details>

**Researcher**: 看看你找到了多少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher**: Look at how many you're finding.

</details>

**Gregor**: 我感觉自己像**咕噜**，我的宝贝！如果不是那么危险，这会是个有趣的活动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: I feel like Gollum, my precious! if it weren't so dangerous, it'd be a fun activity to do.

</details>

**Researcher**: 这些是大块的，那么那些你看不见的微粒呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher**: These are the big chunks, so what about all the particles you can't see?

</details>

**Speaker**: 这种材料曾用于建造**世贸中心**大楼。当双子塔倒塌时，它被粉碎成微观大小，并释放到空气中。这些微粒在空气中停留了数天，成千上万的人在不知情的情况下吸入了它们。它们深埋在人们的肺部，造成严重破坏并引发各种疾病。几十年来我们都知道这些微粒极其危险，但当双子塔倒塌时，没有人得到警告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: This same kind of material was used in the construction of the World Trade Center buildings. And when the towers fell, it was pulverized to microscopic size and released into the air. The particles remained airborne for days and thousands of people unknowingly breathed them in. They buried themselves deep within people's lungs, wreaking havoc and causing all sorts of diseases. We've known for decades that these particles are extremely dangerous, but when the towers fell, no one was warned.

</details>

**Speaker**: 浓度如此之高，以至于它们不会构成健康危害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard.

</details>

**Gregor**: 然而，今天与这种灰尘相关的疾病造成的死亡人数，是袭击本身的两倍多。一旦我们开始寻找，我们就会在意想不到的地方不断发现这种材料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: And yet today the diseases linked to that dust have killed more than twice as many people as the attacks themselves. Once we started looking, we kept finding this material in places we never expected.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他告诉报纸：“人们不只是在吃它、呼吸它，他们还在直接注射它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: He was telling the newspapers, "People aren't just eating it and breathing it, they're mainlining it."

</details>

**Gregor**: 在热门的越野地点、化妆品甚至儿童玩具中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: In popular off-roading spots, in makeup, and even kids toys.

</details>

**Sean**: **米老鼠**蜡笔，别这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: Say It Ain't So Mickey Mouse crayons.

</details>

**Speaker**: 不！它已经在学校和家庭周围的灰尘中被检测到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: No! It's been detected in the dust around schools and homes.

</details>

**Speaker**: 那里有五代人因此丧生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Five generations of people died up there.

</details>

**Gregor**: 然而，我们没有彻底禁止它，而是任由它扩散。一些国家每年仍在进口数十万吨，据估计到2035年，将有近**280万人**可能因此死亡。这是一个关于一种致命的奇迹材料的视频，我们却无法停止使用它。这项调查基于公开文件、录音和第三方来源。所有链接都在描述中。感谢**Ground News**赞助本视频。稍后会详细介绍他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: And instead of banning it outright, we let it spread. Some countries are still importing hundreds of thousands of tons each year, and it's estimated that by 2035, nearly 2.8 million people might die because of it. This is a video about a deadly miracle material we can't stop using. This investigation is based on publicly available documents, recordings, and third party sources. All of our links are in the description. Thank you to Ground News for sponsoring this video. More about them later.

### 石棉的古老发现

**Gregor**: 有一个关于公元二世纪左右古希腊人的故事。他们有一个金色的灯笼，可以燃烧一整年而不熄灭，这都归功于一种非常特殊的灯芯，它就是烧不坏。那么他们是如何开发这项技术的呢？事实是，他们没有开发，他们是发现了它。想象一下，你2000年前走在路上，看到这种毛茸茸的东西从地里冒出来。它有许多纤维，你可以将它们拉开并扭成各种形状。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: There is this story about the ancient Greeks from around the second century AD. They had this golden lantern that would burn for a whole year without going out, all because of a very special wick that just wouldn't burn down. So how did they develop this technology? Well, the truth is they didn't, they found it. Imagine you're walking around 2,000 years ago and you see this fluffy looking stuff poking out the ground. It's got all of these fibers that you can pull apart and twist into shapes.

</details>

**Sean**: 首先，我们来拿一束。它看起来像棉花。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: First off, let's get a nice bundle. So it looks like cotton.

</details>

**Gregor**: 它看起来会烧得很好，就像它会——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: It looks like it would burn really well, like it would just-

</details>

**Speaker**: 是的，你可以用它生火，对吧，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah, you can start a fire with it, right, alright.

</details>

**Gregor**: 好的，我们看看会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Okay, let's see what happens.

</details>

**Sean**: 它没有燃烧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: It's not burning.

</details>

**Speaker**: 那是因为这实际上是一种**岩石**。它是一种天然矿物。其核心构成单元很简单，是一个被四个氧原子包围的**硅原子**。硅在其外层有四个电子，但它真正想要八个。所以每个氧原子都与它共享一个电子，但氧原子共享不均匀，因为它比硅更具电负性，它会将那些共享电子拉向自己。这使得氧原子侧略带负电，硅原子侧略带正电。现在这些原子之间存在静电引力，这使得原子彼此靠近并加强了这种键。结果是一个极其稳定的金字塔形单元，称为**二氧化硅四面体**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: That's because this is actually a rock. It's a naturally occurring mineral. The core building block is simple. It's a silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms. Now silicon has four electrons in its outer shell, but it really wants eight. So each of the oxygens shares one electron with it, but oxygen doesn't share evenly since it's more electronegative than silicon, it pulls those shared electrons closer to itself. This leaves the oxygen side slightly negative and the silicon side slightly positive. Now there's an electrostatic attraction between these atoms, which pulls the atoms closer together and strengthens this bond. The result is an incredibly stable pyramid shaped unit called as silica tetrahedron.

</details>

**Speaker**: 但如果你看看这些角上的氧原子，它们只共享了一个电子，但它们实际上想要两个来完成它们的外层。所以这些角与其他的硅原子连接起来，形成更多的四面体。通过这种方式，结构不断增长。内部的键非常坚固和稳定，而且由于原子已经与硅酸盐结构内部的氧原子紧密结合，空气中的氧气没有可以反应的东西，所以这种材料不会燃烧。但总的来说，这些构成单元并没有什么特别之处。地球上超过90%的矿物都是由这种物质构成的，从**石英**到**粘土**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But if you look at the oxygens in these corner spots, they've only shared one electron, but they actually want two to complete their outer shells. So the corners link up with other silicon atoms to form more tetrahedra. And in this way, the structure just keeps growing. The bonds inside here are incredibly strong and stable, and because the atoms are already tightly bound to the oxygens inside the silicate structure, the oxygen in the air has nothing to react with, so the material doesn't burn. But overall, there's nothing special about these building blocks. More than 90% of the Earth's minerals are made from this stuff, everything from quartz to clay.

</details>

**Speaker**: 这种材料的特殊之处在于这些单元如何连接。在这里，四面体形成了一个**薄片**，与它结合的是第二个薄片，由**镁原子**和**羟基**组成，羟基只是一个氧原子和一个氢原子粘在一起。现在，这两个层之间的原子间距略有不同。所以有一个微小的错配，这导致这些层之间产生张力，使它们卷曲起来，最终形成这些微小的**卷轴状管**。这些管在受热时不容易分解。这种结构在高达**600摄氏度**左右的温度下保持稳定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: What makes this material special is how those units link up. Here, the tetrahedra have formed a sheet, and bonded to it there is actually a second sheet made of magnesium atoms and hydroxyl groups, which are just an oxygen and a hydrogen stuck together. Now, the atomic spacings of these two layers are slightly different. So there's a tiny mismatch, which causes tension between these layers causing them to curl up, and you end up with these tiny scroll-like tubes. These tubes don't break down easily under heat. The structure stays stable up to around 600 degrees Celsius.

</details>

**Gregor**: 那么，所有这些你看到的穿插其中的单个纤维，它们都是这些卷曲状的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: So like all these individual fibers that you see running through here, those are all like these curls?

</details>

**Speaker**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yes.

</details>

**Gregor**: 那是什么，那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: What is that, what was that there?

</details>

**Sean**: 那只是我用镊子扭动纤维的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: That's just a place where I twisted the fiber with my tweezers.

</details>

**Gregor**: 哦，好的。当你扭动这些纤维时，它们实际上不会断裂。所以它实际上是一种可以编织的岩石。当你这样做时，纤维会形成一种缠结的层状结构。所以如果引入热量，它必须通过许多接触点从一根纤维传递到另一根纤维，空气填充在它们之间的空间。这降低了热量通过材料传播的速度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Oh, okay. And when you twist these fibers, they actually don't break. So it's literally a rock you can weave. And when you do, the fibers form a tangled, layered structure. So if heat is introduced, it has to pass from fiber to fiber across many contact points with air filling the spaces between them. This reduces how quickly heat can spread through the material.

</details>

### 工业应用与火灾防护

**Gregor**: 因此，人们开始将其编织成**剧院幕布**和**蒸汽机绝缘毯**，甚至**防火服**，基本上是任何他们不希望着火的地方。但最重要的用途是在19世纪。在1790年至1870年间，美国城市地区的人口从20分之一跃升到大约四分之一。为了适应这种情况，人们不得不在现有建筑上加盖楼层，庭院里则挤满了临时扩建的部分，有效地将所有这些建筑紧密地堆积在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Because of that, people started weaving it into things like theater curtains and insulation blankets for steam engines, even fireproof clothing, essentially anywhere they didn't want something to catch fire. But by far the most important use came around in the 1800s. Between 1790 and 1870, the number of people living in urban areas in America jumped from 1 in 20 to around 1 in 4. So to accommodate this, people had to tack on extra floors onto existing buildings and courtyards would then be filled with makeshift extensions, effectively tightly packing all of these buildings together.

</details>

**Gregor**: 几乎所有这些建筑都是木制的，但里面的人仍然用明火做饭。他们使用煤气灯，点燃蜡烛。所以一次事故，整个社区都可能付之一炬。这种现实在1835年12月袭击了**纽约市**，在短短两天内，**曼哈顿**爆发了三场独立的火灾。一位旁观者将其描述为“一片火海，伴随着咆哮、翻滚、燃烧的波浪”。最终，曼哈顿三分之一英里的区域被吞噬，摧毁了近**700座建筑**，损失达**2000万美元**。这相当于今天的**7.3亿美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Pretty much all these buildings were made out of wood, but the people inside still cooked with open flames. They used gas lamps, they lit candles. So one accident and an entire neighborhood could go up in flames. That reality hit New York City in December, 1835, when within a span of just two days, three separate fires erupted in Manhattan. One bystander described what followed as "An ocean of fire with roaring, rolling, burning waves." By the end, a third of a mile of Manhattan was engulfed, destroying nearly 700 buildings at a cost of $20 million. That's over $730 million of today's money.

</details>

**Gregor**: 类似的灾难在世界各地的城市发生，**芝加哥**、**伦敦**、**汉堡**、**东京**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Similar catastrophes were happening in cities all over the world, Chicago, London, Hamburg, Tokyo.

</details>

**Reporter**: 这种可怕的破坏速度何时才能结束？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: When will this appalling rate of destruction come to an end?

</details>

**Gregor**: 问题在于，当建筑物燃烧时，它会将余烬喷向空中。这些余烬随后被风携带，落在其他屋顶上，将其点燃。所以在**纽约大火**23年后，一位名叫**亨利·沃德·约翰斯**的21岁年轻人着手通过使屋顶防火来打破这种连锁反应。但这比听起来要棘手。无论他的解决方案是什么，它都必须能在整个城市使用。所以它必须足够便宜和容易大规模生产，足够耐用以暴露在屋顶上，经受夏日烘烤和冬季冰冻，最重要的是，即使暴露在燃烧的余烬中，它也不能点燃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: The problem was that when a building burned, it spewed up embers into the air. These then got carried by the wind and landed onto other roofs, setting them alight. So 23 years after the Great Fire of New York, a 21-year-old named Henry Ward Johns set out to break that chain reaction by making roofs fireproof. But that's trickier than it sounds. Whatever his solution was, it had to be usable across an entire city. So cheap and easy enough to mass produce, durable enough to sit exposed on rooftops baking in the summer sun, freezing in the winter, and most importantly, it was not allowed to ignite even when exposed to burning embers.

</details>

**Gregor**: 约翰斯知道有一种矿物已经被纺成防火织物，但只有长纤维才适用于线。较短的纤维实际上被当作废料扫到一边。约翰斯意识到这些废料正是他所需要的，防火、坚韧，最重要的是便宜。所以他在他的地下室公寓里建立了一个临时实验室，开始实验。他用茶壶加热焦油，涂抹在布上，然后压入这些微小的纤维。然后他用他妻子全新的洗衣机将整个东西压过，当他测试时，它成功了，它没有燃烧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Now, Johns knew of a mineral that was already being spun into fireproof fabric, but only the long fibers were useful for thread. The shorter ones were actually swept aside as waste. Johns realized those scraps were exactly what he needed, fireproof, tough and most importantly, cheap. So he set up a makeshift lab in his basement apartment and started experimenting. He heated up tar in his tea kettle, smeared that onto cloth, and then pressed in these tiny fibers. Then he ringed the whole thing through his wife's brand new clothes ringer, and when he tested it, it worked, it didn't burn.

</details>

**Gregor**: 1868年，**亨利·沃德·约翰斯**为他的发明申请了专利，到1927年，他建立的公司**Johns-Manville**年销售额达到**4500万美元**，按今天的货币计算超过**8亿美元**。很快，人们开始在各种建筑材料中使用这种耐火材料。在美国各地，消费量从1900年的约**20,400吨**增长到1973年的峰值**803,000吨**。正因为如此，美国几乎所有建筑物，无论是公共还是私人，商业还是住宅，都使用了某种形式的这种材料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: In 1868, Henry Ward Johns patented his invention, and by 1927, the company he built was generating $45 million in annual sales, more than 800 million in today's money. Soon people were using this fire-resistant stuff in all kinds of building materials, across America, consumption grew from around 20,400 tons in 1900 to a peak of 803,000 tons in 1973. Because of that, pretty much every building in the US, public or private, commercial or residential, used some form of this material.

</details>

**Gregor**: 在同一时期，更严格的建筑规范、更安全的供暖系统和其他耐火材料也得到了引入，这表明，在此期间，与火灾相关的死亡人数下降了约**80%**。所以这种材料可能帮助全球数百万人挽救了生命。因为它不会被火烧毁，古希腊人给它的名字一直沿用至今。他们称之为“不可熄灭的”，或者说**石棉**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: During that same period, stronger building codes, safer heating systems and other fire-resistant materials were also introduced, and it showed, during that time, fire-related deaths dropped around 80%. So this material likely helped save millions of lives worldwide. Because it couldn't be destroyed by fire, the name the ancient Greeks gave it, it stuck around. They called it inextinguishable, or asbestos.

</details>

### 石棉无处不在：奇迹材料

**Presenter**: 石棉，这种非凡的矿物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Presenter**: Asbestos, the remarkable mineral.

</details>

**Gregor**: 到20世纪中叶，石棉无处不在，刹车片、烤面包机、熨衣板、吹风机、外科敷料和毯子里都有。酿酒师用它过滤啤酒。一种牙膏品牌甚至用它来增加抛光效果。百货商店橱窗和电影《**绿野仙踪**》中的假雪，也都是石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: By the mid 20th century, asbestos was everywhere, inside brake pads, toasters, ironing boards, hair dryers, surgical dressings, and blankets. You know, brewers filtered beer through it. One brand of toothpaste even used it for extra polish, the fake snow in department store windows and in movies like "The Wizard of Oz," all of that's asbestos too.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我们正在经历不寻常的天气，是吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Unusual weather we're having, eh?

</details>

**Gregor**: 抱歉，**多萝西**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Sorry, Dorothy.

</details>

**Speaker**: 这件事太大了，**漫威**甚至有一个反派叫**石棉女士**。她会放火逃避警察，然后轻松地走过火海，安全地待在她的石棉紧身衣里。为了满足这种需求，石棉被大规模地从地下开采出来。主要的采矿作业遍布**加拿大**、**俄罗斯**和**南非**，全球产量在1977年达到每年约**480万吨**的峰值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It was such a big deal, Marvel even had a villain called Asbestos Lady. She'd set a fire to escape the police, and she'd easily walk through it, safe inside her asbestos bodysuit. To feed this demand, asbestos was pulled out of the ground on an enormous scale. Major mining operations spread across Canada, Russia, and South Africa with global production peaking at approximately 4.8 million tons per year in 1977.

</details>

**Speaker**: 但石棉最终出现在如此多不同产品中的原因，是因为它实际上是一组不同的矿物。我们之前试图燃烧的那种白色、蓬松的物质，叫做**温石棉**（chrysotile），它属于一种名为**蛇纹石**的矿物家族。但其他类型的石棉看起来完全不同。例如，还有棕色的石棉，称为**铁石棉**（amosite）。它形成粗厚的纤维，几乎看起来像木屑，坚固、稳定且高度耐热。所以它非常适合用于建筑材料，如**水泥板**。这种类型属于不同的矿物家族，**角闪石**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But the reason asbestos ended up in so many different products is because it's actually a group of different minerals, that white, fluffy stuff we tried to burn earlier, it's called chrysotile, and it belongs to a mineral family known as the serpentines. But other types of asbestos looked completely different. For instance, there is also brown asbestos known as amosite. It forms thick fibers that almost look like wood splinters, strong, stable, and highly heat resistant. So it was perfect for putting into building materials like cement panels. This type belongs to a different mineral family, the amphiboles.

</details>

**Speaker**: 在这里，二氧化硅四面体不是形成薄片，而是锁定成坚硬的梯状链条，而铁石棉、**铁**和**镁离子**，以及嵌入结构中的羟基，将这些链条结合在一起，形成这些长而针状的纤维。但如果稍微调整一下化学成分，让铁和**钠离子**结合这些链条，你就会得到这种**蓝石棉**（crocidolite）。这些晶体很容易沿其长度分裂，形成这些细小柔韧的纤维，它们仍然异常坚固，抗拉强度可与高级钢丝媲美。这种类型用于耐化学腐蚀的绝缘材料、造船厂，甚至早期防毒面具内的过滤器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Here, instead of forming sheets, the silica tetrahedra lock into rigid, ladder-like chains, and amosite, iron and magnesium ions, along with hydroxyl groups embedded in the structure, bind those chains together, forming these long, needle-like fibers, but tweak that chemistry just slightly so that now iron and sodium ions bind the chains, and you get this, blue asbestos or crocidolite. These crystals split easily along their length and they create these fine flexible fibers that are still extraordinarily strong with tensile strengths comparable to high grade steel wire. This type went into chemical-resistant insulation, shipyards, and even filters inside early gas masks.

</details>

**Speaker**: 哦，还有一种用途，现在听起来难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Oh, and there was another use, one that's hard to believe now.

</details>

**Speaker**: 在我手中的这个魔盒里，有一些在**北卡罗来纳州**制造的东西。它们是20世纪50年代生产的香烟，如果你看滤嘴，你会发现滤嘴是蓝色的，石棉。这是**Kent**牌香烟，带有**Micronite滤嘴**，滤嘴本身就是用**青石棉**制造的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: In this magic box I have right here is something that was manufactured right here in North Carolina. They're cigarettes, produced in the 1950s, and if you look at the filter, you see the filters are blue, asbestos. This is Kent with a Micronite filter that was manufactured with crocidolite asbestos in the filter itself.

</details>

**Speaker**: 所以你不仅在吸烟，你还在通过一个蓝石棉滤嘴吸烟。是的，真是个好买卖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: So you're not only smoking, you were smoking it through a blue asbestos filter. Yes, what a deal.

</details>

**Speaker**: 只有**Kent**拥有你听过如此多的革命性新**Micronite滤嘴**。Kent，而且只有Kent过滤效果最好，过滤效果最好，过滤效果最好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Only Kent has the revolutionary new Micronite filter you've heard so much about. Kent and only Kent filters best, filters best, filters best.

</details>

### 早期警示：石棉肺

**Gregor**: 在20世纪初，一位名叫**内莉·克肖**的年轻女子在一家将石棉纤维纺成线的工厂工作。她每天都吸入那些机器排放到空气中的灰尘。所以到了三十出头的时候，她病得很重，几乎无法呼吸。当她最终决定向工厂寻求帮助时，他们拒绝了，他们说帮助工人会开创一个危险的先例。内莉不久后去世，年仅33岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: In the early 1900s, a young woman named Nelly Kershaw worked in a factory that spun asbestos fibers into threads. Every day she breathed in the dust that those machines threw into the air. So by her early thirties, she was so sick she could barely breathe. And when she finally decided to ask the factory for help, they refused, they said helping out workers would set a dangerous precedent. Nelly died shortly after at the age of just 33.

</details>

**Gregor**: 内莉的案例引起了病理学家**威廉·库克博士**的注意。当他打开她的胸腔时，她的肺部呈灰色且布满疤痕，几乎是蓝黑色，就像内部有巨大的瘀伤。当他的解剖刀划过它们时，它们发出沙沙声。就像刮擦砂纸一样。组织充满了矿物颗粒，在显微镜下，病因是毋庸置疑的，石棉纤维嵌在肺组织中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Nelly's case caught the attention of pathologist Dr. William Cook. When he opened up her chest, her lungs were gray and scarred, almost blue-black, like they had a huge internal bruise. And when his scalpel passed through them, they rasped. It was like scraping against sandpaper. The tissue was full of mineral grit, and under the microscope the cause was unmistakable, asbestos fibers lodged into the lung tissue.

</details>

**Speaker**: 如果我们吸入某种石棉纤维，我不会把它们想象成微小的直箭头，它们会直接穿过鼻子或嘴巴，然后向下进入气管。如果我们继续向下，随着我们深入肺组织，它们会变得越来越小。然后你进入这些**肺泡囊**，这些石棉纤维会滞留在那里的组织中，肺分泌物、酶，甚至白细胞，都很难分解它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: If we were to inhale some type of an asbestos fiber, I kind of won't think of them as like little microscopic straight arrows, they kind of just shoot down through the nose or the mouth and move down through the trachea. If we continue on going down here, we get smaller and smaller as we penetrate deeper into the lung tissue. And then you get into these alveolar sacs, these asbestos fibers, they lodge in the tissue there, and lung secretions, enzymes, even white blood cells, they have a really hard time breaking those down.

</details>

**Speaker**: 最终你的肺部深处会留下疤痕。1924年，**库克博士**发表了对这种疾病的首次医学描述，这种疾病后来被称为**石棉肺**。当这些石棉纤维滞留在肺部时，身体会将其视为入侵者，一种名为**巨噬细胞**的特殊细胞会进入，这些细胞的工作是吞噬和消化细菌、灰尘或碎片。但石棉纤维太长太硬，无法吞咽。这有点像试图横着吃牙签。巨噬细胞不断尝试并失败，在此过程中，它们会释放**炎症化学物质**，损害周围的肺组织。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: You end up with scarring deep inside the lungs. In 1924, Dr. Cook published the first medical description of this condition, which became known as asbestosis. When these asbestos fibers lodge into the lungs, the body treats them like invaders, specialized cells called macrophages move in, cells whose job it is to engulf and digest bacteria, dust or debris. But asbestos fibers are too long and stiff to swallow. It's kind of like trying to eat a toothpick sideways. The macrophages keep trying and failing, and in the process, they release inflammatory chemicals that damage the surrounding lung tissue.

</details>

**Speaker**: 因此，日复一日吸入石棉粉尘的工人，积累了越来越多的损伤。当**英国政府**派出的医生检查数百名石棉工人时，他们发现超过**25%**的人已经表现出肺部疾病的迹象。对于暴露超过20年的工人，这个数字接近**80%**。因此，在1931年，政府正式将石棉列为**工作场所危害**，使其成为首批因健康风险而受到监管的工业材料之一。

<details>

**Speaker**: So workers breathing in asbestos dust day after day, accumulated more and more damage. When doctors sent by the British government examined hundreds of asbestos workers, they found that more than 25% already showed signs of lung disease. And for workers with over 20 years of exposure, that number was closer to 80%. So in 1931, the government officially classified asbestos as a workplace hazard, making it one of the first industrial materials to be regulated for health risks.

**Speaker**: 但新规定只涵盖了石棉制造工厂。它们没有扩展到其他工人，如造船工人、矿工或建筑工人，他们经常接触石棉粉尘。在大西洋彼岸，情况也好不到哪里去。美国没有具有约束力的联邦石棉规定，只有一个建议。**美国公共卫生服务局**建议的临时暴露限值为每立方英尺空气**500万个石棉颗粒**，这意味着一个正常呼吸的工人每小时可以吸入超过**3亿个石棉颗粒**，仍被认为符合指导方针。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But the new rules only covered factories where asbestos was manufactured. They didn't extend to other workers like ship builders, miners or construction workers who were regularly exposed to asbestos dust. Across the Atlantic, things weren't much better. There was no binding federal asbestos rules in the States, only a recommendation. The US Public Health Service suggested a temporary exposure limit of 5 million asbestos particles for a single cubic foot of air, which meant that a worker breathing normally could inhale over 300 million asbestos particles an hour and still be considered within guidelines.

**Speaker**: 这对造船厂工人来说尤其成问题，当**第二次世界大战**爆发时，船只上都塞满了石棉绝缘材料。所以工人们每天都在厚厚的纤维云中切割和安装石棉。根据当时的指导方针，这些水平符合安全工作条件的官方定义。事实上，石棉仍然被宣传为一种神奇的材料。几年前，《**时代**》杂志甚至将**Johns-Manville**的总裁**刘易斯·H·布朗**放在1939年4月3日的封面上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: This became especially problematic for shipyard workers when World War II broke out, ships were packed with asbestos insulation. So workers spent their days cutting and fitting asbestos in thick clouds of fibers. And according to the guidelines of the day, these levels met the official definition of safe working conditions. In fact, asbestos was still marketed as a magic material. A few years earlier, "Time" magazine actually put Johns-Manville's president, Lewis H. Brown on its April 3rd, 1939 cover.

### 间皮瘤关联与行业掩盖

**Gregor**: 但在20世纪60年代初，终于有一位医生开始将石棉的线索连接起来。**欧文·塞利科夫博士**在**新泽西州帕特森**经营一家小型诊所，当地的石棉工人工会询问他们的成员是否可以去看他。不久之后，他看到了多名工人患有严重的肺部瘢痕，或者更令人担忧的是，一种极其罕见的癌症，称为**间皮瘤**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But in the early 1960s, finally one doctor started connecting the dots on asbestos. Dr. Irving Selikoff was running a small clinic in Patterson, New Jersey, when the local asbestos workers Union asked if their members could come and see him. Before long, he'd seen multiple workers with either severe lung scarring or more concerningly, an extremely rare cancer called mesothelioma.

</details>

**Speaker**: **间皮瘤**与石棉暴露密切相关，是胸腔内膜细胞的癌症。最常见的是**胸膜腔**。这些胸膜膜内衬有间皮细胞。有时会发生的情况是，纤维会从肺组织中穿出，直接进入这个腔体，它们实际上可以刺穿肺部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: A mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos exposure and is cancer of those cells lining the inside of the chest cavity. And most commonly, it's this pleural cavity. These pleural membranes are aligned with mesothelial cells. Sometimes what happens is the fibers will work their way out of the lung tissue and directly get into this cavity here, and they can literally pierce out the lungs.

</details>

**Speaker**: 它们造成持续的刺激。随着时间的推移，这会引发构成这些内膜的细胞发生癌变。**塞利科夫**需要更多数据来了解问题的规模，但工厂主拒绝与他分享工人的医疗记录。所以塞利科夫不得不发挥创造力。在**第二次世界大战**期间，许多受雇于**海军**的造船厂工人接受了联邦背景调查。成千上万的这些人一直在使用石棉来绝缘船只。所以塞利科夫利用幸存的**联邦调查局**战时人事记录，开始追踪他们，并一个接一个地费力拼凑他们的病史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They cause constant irritation. And over time, that can trigger cancerous changes in the cells that make up those linings. Selikoff needed more data to understand the scale of the problem, but factory owners refused to share medical records from their workers with him. So Selikoff had to get creative. See, during World War II, many shipyard workers employed by the Navy underwent federal background checks. Thousands of these men had been working with asbestos to insulate ships. So using surviving FBI wartime personnel records, Selikoff began tracking them down and one by one painstakingly pieced together their medical histories.

</details>

**Speaker**: 浮出水面的不是少数孤立的悲剧，而是一种模式，即暴露的致命性甚至超过了战斗本身。每1000名军人中有**8.6人**在行动中丧生，而每1000名造船厂工人中，后来有**14人**死于石棉相关癌症。塞利科夫对数百名石棉绝缘工人展开了正式调查，他的发现证实了他的担忧：普遍的致残性石棉肺、数十例间皮瘤病例、肺癌发病率比预期高出约**七倍**，以及胃肠道癌症增加了**三倍**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: What emerged wasn't a handful of isolated tragedies, it was a pattern, that exposure proved deadlier than combat itself. 8.6 out of every 1,000 servicemen were killed in action, whereas 14 out of every 1,000 shipyard workers later died from asbestos-related cancers. Selikoff launched a formal investigation into hundreds of asbestos insulation workers, and what he found confirmed his fears, widespread disabling asbestosis, dozens of cases of mesothelioma, lung cancer rates roughly seven times higher than expected and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers.

</details>

**Speaker**: 1964年，他在**纽约科学院**组织了一次会议，首次将所有这些证据公开呈现在一个地方，并记录在案。这标志着石棉不再被视为一种现代奇迹材料，而是开始被认为是**公共健康危机**的时刻。但石棉行业进行了反击，试图诋毁塞利科夫。行业资助的研究团体发表论文，淡化暴露风险，并将塞利科夫的发现描述为夸大其词。他们发起了一场协调一致的公关活动来诋毁他，试图称他为危言耸听者，并散布谣言说他甚至不是真正的医生，仅仅因为他是在**苏格兰**获得的医学学位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: In 1964, he organized a conference at the New York Academy of Sciences where for the first time, all this evidence was presented publicly in one place, and on the record, it marked the moment when asbestos stopped being seen as a modern miracle material and instead started being recognized as a public health crisis. But the asbestos industry fought back trying to discredit Selikoff. Industry-funded research groups came out with papers minimizing the risk of exposure and framing Selikoff's findings as overblown. They started a coordinated PR effort to discredit him, trying to call him alarmist, and starting a rumor that he wasn't even a real doctor just because he got his medical degree out in Scotland.

</details>

**Speaker**: 但塞利科夫继续前进。他不断发表关于石棉暴露对健康造成毁灭性影响的数据，他每天工作18小时，记录每一位写信给他的病人。他联系政策制定者，甚至世界各国领导人，敦促他们采取行动对抗石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But Selikoff kept going. He kept publishing data on the devastating health effects of asbestos exposure, he worked 18 hour days documenting every patient who wrote to him. He contacted policymakers, even world leaders, urging them to take action against asbestos.

</details>

**Speaker**: **塞利科夫**，这位在1970年代组织这次会议的传奇医生发现，静脉注射药物被石棉过滤污染了。人们不只是在吃它、呼吸它，他们还在直接注射它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Now Selikoff, the legendary doctor who organized this conference in the 1970s found that intravenous drugs were being contaminated by asbestos filtration. People aren't just eating it and breathing it, they're mainlining it.

</details>

**Gregor**: 到了1970年代，没有人再能否认了，矿工、工厂工人、造船厂绝缘工人，那些在石棉繁荣时期几十年前接触过石棉的人，现在正以惊人的数量出现多种癌症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: By the 1970s, no one could deny it any longer, miners, factory workers, shipyard insulators, people who'd been exposed decades earlier during the asbestos boom, were now turning up with multiple cancers in huge numbers.

</details>

**Speaker**: 石棉暴露与各种不同的癌症有关。肺组织中有**淋巴管**，但你的全身都有。石棉纤维有时会自行迁移到淋巴管中。有时白细胞会将其带入淋巴系统。一旦进入淋巴系统，它就有可能到达人体的任何地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Asbestos exposure is linked to all sorts of different cancers. The lung tissue has lymphatic vessels in it, but you have 'em throughout your whole body. The asbestos fibers sometimes on their own can migrate into the lymphatic vessels. Sometimes the white blood cells will take it into the lymphatic system. Once you hit the lymphatic system, you have the potential to go anywhere in the human body.

</details>

**Gregor**: 尸检发现纤维几乎存在于身体的每个器官中，大脑、骨髓、脾脏、肠道、胰腺、前列腺、卵巢、甲状腺和肝脏。在这些纤维到达的每个组织中，它们都会引发相同的连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Autopsies have found fibers in nearly every organ in the body, the brain, bone marrow, spleen, intestines, pancreas, prostate, ovaries, thyroid, and liver. And in every tissue those fibers reach, they set off the same chain reaction.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我想象这些白细胞有自己的个性，它们会变得非常愤怒和沮丧，因为它们无法吞噬这种石棉纤维。他们创造了这个术语，本质上叫做“**受挫的吞噬作用**”。它们开始释放像**活性氧物质**这样的东西。它们会损害周围的细胞，非常重要的是损害**DNA**。这些细胞会开始失控地分裂，当它们开始聚集在一起时，我们开始称这些细胞团为**癌症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I'm imagining these white blood cells with personalities, and they get all mad and frustrated because they can't engulf this asbestos fiber. They've coined this term called essentially, frustrated phagocytosis. They start releasing these things like reactive oxygen species. They can cause damage to surrounding cells, and really important is damage to DNA. Those cells can start dividing out of control when they start to clump together, and we start to call those clumps of cells cancer.

</details>

### 企业欺骗与证据掩埋

**Gregor**: 美国法院充斥着针对**Johns-Manville**等公司的诉讼。石棉造成的危害有充分的记录。信息是公开的。公司应该知道他们的产品是危险的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: US courts were flooded with lawsuits against companies like Johns-Manville. The harm asbestos caused was well documented. The information was out there. Companies should have known their products were dangerous.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他们应该知道公共领域中关于石棉危害的合理可用信息。如果他们能阅读石棉专利，他们就能阅读石棉病理学论文。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They should know what's reasonably available in the public domain about the dangers of asbestos. If they can read asbestos patents, they can read asbestos pathology papers.

</details>

**Gregor**: 但这些公司否认了。需要的是确凿的证据，证明这些公司知道他们的产品正在杀死他们的工人。然后，律师**卡尔·阿什**在1974年一家名为**Raybestos Manhattan**的巨型石棉公司的报告中发现了一些奇怪的东西。在这份报告中，该公司表示他们实际上自1930年代以来一直在调查石棉的健康危害。所以阿什开始深入挖掘。他提交了一份内部文件请求，起初，该公司声称找不到太多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But the companies denied it. What was needed was definitive evidence that the companies knew their products were killing their workers. Then an attorney, Carl Ash, noticed something strange in the 1974 report by this huge asbestos company called Raybestos Manhattan. See, in this report, the company suggested that they had actually been investigating health hazards of asbestos since the 1930s. So Ash started digging. He filed a request for internal documents, and at first, the company claimed it couldn't find much.

</details>

**Gregor**: 然后出乎意料的是，阿什收到了一箱文件，里面塞满了由**Raybestos Manhattan**前总裁**萨姆纳·辛普森**精心保存的文件。早在1935年，一家期刊联系了辛普森，因为他们想写一篇关于石棉肺的文章。不久之后，辛普森亲自联系了**Johns-Manville**的律师**范迪弗·布朗**，说：“我认为关于石棉说得越少，对我们越有利。”布朗回复说：“我非常同意你的看法，我们的利益最好通过让石棉肺得到最少的宣传来维护。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Then unexpectedly, Ash was handed a banker's box stuffed full of documents, meticulously kept by Raybestos Manhattan's, former president, Sumner Simpson. Back in 1935, a journal contacted Simpson because they wanted to write an article about asbestosis. Shortly after, Simpson himself reached out to Johns-Manville's lawyer, Vandiver Brown, saying, "I think the less said about asbestos, the better off we are." To which Brown replied, "I quite agree with you that our interests are best served by having asbestosis receive the minimum of publicity."

</details>

**Gregor**: 同样的论文还披露，在1930年代，**Raybestos**和**Johns-Manville**聘请了一家外部公司**Saranac Laboratories**对动物进行石棉研究。但这些公司坚持控制哪些研究结果可以公开。正如**范迪弗**的一封信所指出的：“我们进一步理解，结果将被视为提供所需资金者的财产，他们将决定是否、在何种程度上以及以何种方式公开这些结果。”**Saranac Laboratories**对此条款表示“同意”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: The same papers also revealed that in the 1930s, Raybestos and Johns-Manville hired an external company, Saranac Laboratories, to do studies of asbestos on animals. But the companies insisted on controlling what from those studies will be made public. As a letter from Vandiver points out, "It is our further understanding that the results will be considered the property of those who are advancing the required funds, who will determine whether, to what extent and in what manner they shall be made public." A clause to which Saranac Laboratories said, "Yes."

</details>

**Gregor**: 但在他们负责汇编所有这些证据的首席研究员于1946年去世后，这些公司同意不发表任何包含“令人反感材料”的东西。“令人反感”意味着任何表明石棉致癌的迹象。所以当**Saranac Laboratories**完成他们的研究后，这些公司拿走了报告，进行了编辑，然后就掩埋了证据。这是一份原始手稿的副本，你可以看到整个部分都被划掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But after their lead researcher who was compiling all this evidence died in 1946, the companies agreed that nothing should be published that contained any objectionable material. Objectionable meaning any sort of indication that asbestos causes cancer. So when Saranac Laboratories finished their research, the companies took the report, edited it, and just buried the evidence. Here's an original copy of that manuscript, and you can find whole sections just crossed out.

</details>

**Gregor**: 其他文件甚至更具破坏性。**Johns-Manville**的一位医疗官员后来作证说，直到1971年，该公司都有一项政策，即如果工人的体检显示有石棉肺或石棉相关肺癌的迹象，他们不会告知工人。在一份宣誓证词中，一位证人回忆起他们在1940年代初与**Johns-Manville**总裁的一次会议，询问他们为什么不警告工人石棉的危害。据证人回忆，他们问：“你是说你会让他们一直工作直到他们倒下死去吗？”总裁回答说：“是的，那样我们可以省很多钱。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Other documents were even more damaging. A Johns-Manville medical official later testified that up until 1971, the company had a policy of not telling their workers if their physicals showed signs of asbestosis or asbestos-related lung cancers. And in sworn testimony, a witness recalled a meeting they had in the early 1940s with the president of Johns-Manville, asking why they weren't warning workers about asbestos. As the witness recalls it, they asked, "Do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead?" To which the president replied, "Yes, we save a lot of money that way."

</details>

### 沉默的阴谋与破产

**Gregor**: **萨姆纳·辛普森**的文件一经曝光，就揭示了一场新的工业**水门事件**。该行业标准的“哦，我们不知道”的辩护，简直是土崩瓦解。人们将其与**大型烟草公司**隐瞒吸烟风险的行为相提并论。诉讼激增，每个案件都带来了新的发现，每一轮的发现都揭示了一个更广泛、更协调的掩盖行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Once the Sumner Simpson papers got out, they unlocked a new industrial Watergate. The industry's standard, "Oh, we didn't know," defense, it simply fell apart. Comparisons were made to big tobacco's concealment of smoking risks. And the lawsuits surged, each case brought new discovery and each round of discovery exposed a wider, more coordinated coverup.

</details>

**Gregor**: 自从“石棉肺”一词在1920年代开始出现在医学期刊上以来，**Johns-Manville**就着手巩固其市场地位。首先，他们收购了最大的**岩棉公司**，然后他们收购了一家拥有**硅酸钙绝缘材料**关键专利的公司，这种绝缘材料可以在没有石棉的情况下制造。与此同时，拥有非石棉绝缘材料的公司被鼓励创建石棉产品线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Ever since the word asbestosis started showing up in medical journals in the 1920s, Johns-Manville went out to secure the market around itself. First, they acquired the biggest rock wall company, then they acquired a firm holding the key patents to calcium silicate insulation, insulation that could be made without asbestos. Now, at the same time, companies that had non asbestos insulation were incentivized into creating asbestos product lines.

</details>

**Gregor**: 每次收购或诱导，另一个潜在的竞争对手就失去了谴责石棉并说“哦，我们有无石棉产品”的能力。因此，每个公司反过来都成为了这个“**沉默的阴谋**”的一员。这就是石棉行业保证其生存的方式，通过确保没有人能公开反对它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: With each acquisition or inducement, another potential competitor lost the ability to denounce asbestos and say, "Oh, we have an asbestos-free product." So each in turn became a member of this conspiracy of silence. That is how the asbestos industry guaranteed its survival, by ensuring no one could speak out against it.

</details>

**Narrator**: 我们建议您考虑使用石棉作为您家的墙壁材料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: We suggest you consider asbestos for the walls of your home.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他们的商业决策以及做出这些决策的人都是商人。我的意思是，“道德”或“道德义务”这些词在公司文件中几乎不存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Their business decisions and the people who make them are businessmen. I mean, the word morality or moral obligation is almost non-existent in the corporate documents.

</details>

**Gregor**: 1982年，**Johns-Manville**申请了**破产保护**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: In 1982, Johns-Manville filed for bankruptcy protection.

</details>

**Speaker**: **Manville公司**董事会已决定，公司应根据《**破产法**》第11章申请重组。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Manville Corporation's board of directors has determined that the corporation should file for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.

</details>

**Gregor**: 这不是因为他们破产了，而是在很大程度上被视为一种方式，旨在保护公司免受大量石棉诉讼的冲击。尽管有所有不利于他们的证据，**Johns-Manville**还是幸存了下来。他们至今仍在运营，尽管他们不再生产石棉。在1940年至1980年间，以**Johns-Manville**为首的石棉行业，使大约**2100万美国人**接触了这些纤维。石棉相关死亡每年至少达到**8000到10000人**，还有更多人遭受终身疾病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Not because they were broke, but in a move widely seen as a way to shield the company from a flood of asbestos lawsuits. Despite all the evidence against them, Johns-Manville survived. They continue operating to this day, although they no longer produce asbestos. Between 1940 and 1980, the asbestos industry, led by Johns-Manville, exposed roughly 21 million Americans to these fibers. Asbestos related deaths amounted to at least 8 to 10,000 people every year, with many more suffering lifelong disease.

</details>

### 美国的监管失败

**Gregor**: 1989年，**美国环保局**（EPA）发布了一项规定，逐步淘汰美国几乎所有石棉的使用。这本该是故事的结局。但该行业立即提起诉讼，不是因为有人质疑石棉致癌，这一点当时已无可否认，而是因为一个法律技术问题。根据法律，**EPA**必须证明彻底禁止石棉是唯一的解决方案。任何低于此的措施都行不通。这几乎是一项不可能完成的任务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: In 1989, the EPA issued a rule to phase out almost all asbestos use in the United States. And that should have been the end of the story. But the industry sued immediately, not because anyone disputed asbestos causes cancer, that was undeniable by this point, but because of a legal technicality, see, under the law, the EPA had to prove that an outright ban of asbestos was the only solution. And that anything less than that just wouldn't cut it. This was an almost impossible feat.

</details>

**Gregor**: 现在，该行业辩称他们没有做到这一点，不幸的是，美国法院同意了。所以1991年，他们裁定**EPA**未能达到这个狭隘的法律标准。至此，石棉禁令胎死腹中。但到那时，石棉对制造或使用它的公司来说，在经济和法律上都变得风险巨大，以至于其总体使用量确实下降了。然而，最终，在多年试图定义和规范石棉之后，唯一真正留下来的只是一个狭隘的定义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Now, the industry argued that they hadn't done that, and unfortunately the US courts agreed. So in 1991, they ruled that the EPA just hadn't met this narrow legal standard. And with that, the asbestos ban was dead in the water. But by then, asbestos had become so financially and legally risky for the companies that manufactured it or used it, that its overall use did actually decline. Yet in the end, after years of trying to define and regulate asbestos, the only thing that truly stuck around was a definition and a narrow one.

</details>

**Gregor**: **温石棉**和五种**角闪石**，因为这些是当时唯一被开采、销售和用于工厂的种类。但那六种成为了官方的石棉矿物，而其他任何东西，无论多么像纤维或潜在危险，都不算数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Chrysotile and five amphiboles, because these were the only ones being mined, sold, and used in factories. But those six became the official asbestos minerals and anything else, no matter how fiber-like or potentially dangerous, well, that doesn't count.

Can you find the sparkly box? Right. And send it to me, pronto. There's Claire's in all, in all of the malls, all across America. And then I look further and it's all over the world.

**Speaker**: 这种情况还在不断发生。就在几个月前，**澳大利亚**和**新西兰**大约70所学校不得不关闭，因为在儿童玩沙中发现了石棉。在报道这个故事的60家媒体中，只有**24%**来自右翼来源。根据你获取新闻的渠道，这可能从未进入你的视野，这是一个问题，因为像这样的公共健康信息不应该被忽视。这就是我们请**Ground News**赞助这个视频的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And this keeps happening. Just a couple of months ago, around 70 schools in Australia and New Zealand had to close down because of the asbestos found in children's play sand. Out of the 60 outlets that reported on this story, only 24% were from right-leaning sources. Depending on where you get your news, this might have never crossed your radar, which is a problem because public health information like this shouldn't fall through the cracks. And this is why we've asked Ground News to sponsor this video.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他们将世界各地媒体的新闻汇集到一个地方，这样你就可以轻松地看到党派分歧，通过他们颜色编码的布局，你还可以轻松地按事实性、所有权和来源对新闻进行分类，这样你就可以并排看到像这样的故事是如何被报道的，以及你需要的所有背景信息。以这两个标题为例，这篇来自《**先驱太阳报**》的文章只谈论对石棉的恐惧，而这个事实性很高的来源则明确指出在装饰沙中发现了石棉，这种差异很重要，我想知道这种担忧是仅仅怀疑还是实际的石棉污染，这就是为什么我发现**Ground News**如此有用。你得到的是完整的情况，而不仅仅是一个为了点击量而耸人听听的标题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They compile news from outlets all over the world into one place so that you can easily see the partisan split and with their color-coded layout, it's also easy to sort your news by factuality, ownership and source so that you can see how a story like this is getting covered side by side with all the context you need. Take these two headlines for example, this article from the "Herald Sun" only talks about the fear of asbestos, while this very high factuality source firmly states that asbestos was found in decorative sand, that difference matters, I would like to know whether the concern is over a mere suspicion or actual asbestos contamination, and that's why I find Ground News so useful. You get the full picture, not just one headline sensationalizing for clicks.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他们还有一个专门的**盲点信息流**，用于报道那些被政治光谱两端不成比例地报道的故事，所有这些都是为了帮助人们避免他们的**回音室**。我们与**Ground News**合作，因为我们有相同的使命，那就是追求真相，这就是为什么我们以**40%的折扣**提供他们的**Vantage计划**，网址是ground.news/ve。所以如果你想支持这个频道，同时也想更清楚地了解世界，请查看描述中的链接，或者你也可以扫描这个二维码。所以我要感谢**Ground News**赞助了视频的这一部分，现在让我们去弄清楚为什么石棉会进入所有这些消费品中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And they also have a dedicated blind spot feed for stories like these that are, you know, disproportionately covered by either side of the political spectrum, all to help people avoid their echo chambers. Now, we partnered up with Ground News because we share the same mission, getting to the truth, and that's why we're offering 40% off their vantage plan at ground.news/ve. So if you wanna support the channel, but also want a clearer understanding of the world, check out that link in the description, or you can also scan this QR code. So I wanna thank Ground News for sponsoring this part of the video, and now let's go figure out why asbestos is even getting into all these consumer products.

### 石棉的天然形成与“1%规则”

**Gregor**: 现在，没有人会故意将石棉放入化妆品或儿童玩具中，那么我们都知道是致命的东西怎么会无处不在呢？嗯，这是石棉形成地点的不幸后果，而**蒙大拿州利比**最能说明这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Now, no one is intentionally putting asbestos in makeup or kids' toys, so how did something we know is deadly just end up everywhere? Well, it's an unfortunate consequence of where asbestos forms and nowhere makes that more clear than Libby, Montana.

</details>

**Speaker**: 谈论它让我心碎。那里的矿山是**蛭石矿**。它在北边大约五六英里处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It kind of breaks my heart to talk about it. The mine up there is vermiculite mine. It's about five six miles north.

</details>

**Speaker**: **蛭石**是一种矿物，用于从绝缘材料到防火材料再到盆栽土壤的各种产品中。它本身是无害的。问题是，**利比**的蛭石与**角闪石石棉纤维**混合形成。同样的事情也发生在其他我们开采的矿物上，包括像**滑石粉**这样的东西。这就是石棉最终进入我们**肖恩**实验室看到的那些产品中的原因。最糟糕的是，拥有并经营该矿的公司**W.R. Grace**，他们知道，他们知道矿石含有石棉。他们知道人们正在生病，但他们没有警告小镇。事实上，他们试图掩盖近30年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Vermiculite is a mineral that is used in everything from insulation to fireproofing to potting soil. On its own, it's harmless. The problem was, Libby's vermiculite formed mixed in with affable asbestos fibers. And the same thing happens with other minerals we mine, including stuff like talc. That's how asbestos ends up in products like the ones we saw at Sean's lab. And the worst part, the company that owned and operated the mine, W.R. Grace, they knew, they knew the ore contained asbestos. They knew people were getting sick and they didn't warn the town. In fact, they tried to cover it up for almost 30 years.

</details>

**Speaker**: 他们那里有数百名工人。当然，当矿工回家时，他们的衣服上沾满了灰尘，他们的孩子和妻子也因此感染并死亡。但**利比**周围的医生们知道，他们非常清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They had hundreds of workers in there. And of course, when the miners would go home, they had dust all over their clothes, and their kids and their wives got it and died as well. But the doctors up around Libby, they knew, boy did they know.

</details>

**Speaker**: 除了长期与石棉暴露相关的肺部疾病和癌症外，研究人员还发现一些**自身免疫疾病**的发病率几乎是全国平均水平的**六倍**。到1999年**利比**事件成为头条新闻时，记者记录了在一个不到3000人的小镇上，近**200人**死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Besides the lung disease and cancer's long associated with asbestos exposure, researchers were also finding rates of some autoimmune diseases were nearly six times higher than the national average. And by the time the Libby situation hit the headlines in 1999, reporters documented nearly 200 deaths in a town of fewer than 3,000.

</details>

**Speaker**: 它可能需要20年才能发作，但很快你就会完全无法呼吸，然后死于窒息。我能通过某人的声音判断他们离死亡还有多远，因为他们都没有幸存下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And it could take 20 years for it to go, but pretty soon you have no breath at all and you die of asphyxiation. I could tell I'm talking on the phone by somebody's voice, how far along they were toward death, because none of 'em survived.

</details>

**Speaker**: 最终，在2009年，**EPA**宣布**利比**进入**公共卫生紧急状态**，称其为“美国历史上最严重的社区工业中毒事件”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Finally, in 2009, the EPA declared a public health emergency in Libby, calling it "The worst case of industrial poisoning of a community in US history."

</details>

**Speaker**: 但**利比**只是冰山一角。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But Libby's just the tip of the iceberg,

</details>

**Speaker**: 因为几十年来，**W.R. Grace**将**利比蛭石**运往全国各地，随之而来的是致命的**角闪石石棉**，最终以**阁楼绝缘材料**的形式进入了数百万家庭。**Grace**还生产了一种防火喷雾，用于高层建筑的钢框架。到1970年，美国建造的一半以上的多层建筑都使用了这种防火喷雾，包括**世贸中心**。但这种喷雾实际上被宣传为**无石棉**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Because for decades, W.R. Grace shipped Libby vermiculite around the country, and with it, deadly affable asbestos, which ended up in millions of homes as attic insulation. And Grace also made a fireproof spray that was used on the steel frames of high-rise buildings. By 1970, over half of the multi-story buildings erected in the United States used this fireproof spray, including the World Trade Center. But this spray was actually marketed as asbestos-free.

</details>

**Speaker**: 根据《**纽约时报**》后来的调查，**Grace**游说监管机构采纳一个阈值，即含有少于**1%石棉**的产品将不受监管。**Grace**辩称，如此少量石棉的危险尚未得到证实。这被称为“**1%规则**”或“**Grace规则**”。这项决定不仅影响了**利比矿**的产品，它还重塑了石棉在各地被检测、监管和忽视的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: According to a later investigation by the "New York Times," Grace lobbied regulators to adopt a threshold under which products containing less than 1% of asbestos would not be regulated. Grace argued that the danger of such small amounts had not been proved. This became known as the 1% rule or the Grace Rule. That decision didn't just affect the products from Libby's mine, it reshaped how asbestos was detected, regulated, and ignored everywhere.

</details>

**Speaker**: 哦，我的天哪！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Oh my God!

</details>

**Speaker**: 看看死亡的阴影！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Look at the shadow of death!

</details>

**Speaker**: 哦，我的天哪！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Oh my God!

</details>

**Speaker**: 好的，当那件事发生时，我就知道。我知道他们有石棉，所以我开始打电话。我说：“你们怎么保护人们免受它的侵害？因为现在那些东西到处都是。你们看到了灰尘云，对吧？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Okay, when that went down, I knew it. I knew they had asbestos, and so I started calling. I said, "What do you, how are you gonna protect people from that 'cause now that stuff's all over the place. You saw the dust clouds, right?"

</details>

**Gregor**: **9月11日**事件成为单一灾难性事件后石棉检测的最大现实世界测试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: September 11th became the largest real world test of asbestos detection following a single catastrophic event.

</details>

**Speaker**: 灰尘太厚了，你什么也看不见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The dust is so thick you can't see.

</details>

**Speaker**: 当**EPA**开始采样并分析灰尘时，他们选择了一种我们在实验室使用的方法，称为**偏光显微镜**（PLM）。但**PLM**有两个主要限制。首先，如果样品中石棉的重量低于**1%**，它就很难检测到。其次，它只能看到长度大约超过**五微米**或宽度大约超过**四分之一微米**的纤维。因此，最小且通常最危险的纤维，例如双子塔倒塌时被粉碎的那些，使用**PLM**很难检测到。要可靠地找到这些纤维，你需要**透射电子显微镜**（TEM）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: When the EPA began sampling the dust and analyzing it, they chose a method we use back at the lab called polarized light microscopy or PLM. But the PLM has two major limitations. First, it's struggles to detect asbestos if it's less than 1% by weight in the sample, and second, it can only see the fibers that are roughly longer than about five micrometers or wider than about a quarter of a micrometer. As a result, the smallest and oftentimes the most dangerous fibers, like the ones pulverized during the collapse of the towers, are difficult to detect using just the PLM. To reliably find these, you need transmission electron microscopy or TEM.

</details>

**Sean**: 我们用**光显微镜**最多能放大约**一千倍**，而这个最多能放大约**一百万倍**。但我们需要看到的是，哪些是最细的纤维，它们可能进入你的肺部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: Where we top out of about a thousand times with electro, with light microscopy, this tops out at about a million times. But what we need to see is just what are the finest fibers that potentially can go into your lung.

</details>

**Gregor**: 在没有使用**TEM**的情况下，**EPA**宣布纽约的空气是安全的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Without having used a TEM, the EPA declared New York's air safe.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我们检测的所有物质，包括石棉、铅和挥发性有机化合物，都低于公众健康的任何关注水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Everything we've tested for, which includes asbestos, lead, and VOCs have been below any level of concern for the general public health.

</details>

**Gregor**: 但**911**之后的一些研究人员确实用**TEM**做了研究。他们发现大多数样品中的石棉含量远远高于**EPA**自己的安全阈值。报告还警告说，由于这些纤维中有许多实际上比正常纤维小，它们尤其危险。他们将结果发布在**美国工业卫生协会**网站上，但在几小时内，他们的帖子就消失了。不到24小时后，研究人员被告知他们已被解雇，不再需要前往**世贸中心遗址**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But some researchers after 911 actually did do studies with TEM. They found asbestos levels far above the EPA's own safety thresholds in most of their samples. And the report also warned that because many of these fibers were actually smaller than normal, they were especially dangerous. They posted the results on the American Industrial Hygiene Association website, but within hours, their post disappeared. Less than 24 hours later, the researchers were notified they been taken off the job and were no longer required at Ground Zero.

</details>

**Gregor**: 一位前**EPA**首席调查员后来在**CBS**上表示，他们认为该机构故意使用了错误的检测方法，并淡化了危险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: One former EPA chief investigator later went on CBS saying they believe the agency had deliberately used the wrong testing methods and downplayed the danger.

</details>

**Speaker**: 纽约市直接谎报了空气中石棉的检测结果。当他们最终发布时，他们篡改了结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: New York City directly lied about the test results for asbestos in air. When they finally released them, they doctored the result.

</details>

**Gregor**: 我们不知道这是否属实，但需要明确的是，**PLM**仍然被广泛用于检测石棉，因为它更快、更便宜、更容易部署。但我们知道两件事。首先，**PLM**方法不够灵敏，无法检测**世贸中心遗址**灰尘中是否存在石棉纤维。其次，**EPA**确实有其他更灵敏的方法可用。无论动机如何，结果都是一样的。纽约人被告知空气是安全的，而实际上并非如此。截至2023年12月，已登记在**世贸中心健康计划**中的**6781人**因与**世贸中心遗址**相关的时间而导致的疾病或癌症死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: We don't know if that's true, but to be clear, PLM is still widely used to detect asbestos because it's faster, it's cheaper, it's easier to deploy. But what we do know is two things. First, the PLM method was not sensitive enough to detect whether there were asbestos fibers in the dust at Ground Zero. And second, the EPA did have other, more sensitive methods available to them. Whatever the motives, the result was the same. New Yorkers were told that the air was safe when it really wasn't. And as of December, 2023, 6,781 of those who have been registered with the World Trade Center Health Program have died either of an illness or a cancer linked just to their time being around Ground Zero.

</details>

### 石棉的定义：一个有缺陷的系统

**Gregor**: 但即使**EPA**使用了**TEM**，答案仍然不会简单，因为即使那样，研究人员也会遇到一个更基本的问题。到底什么才算石棉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But even if the EPA had used the TEM, the answer would still not be simple because even then researchers run into a more basic problem. What actually counts as asbestos?

</details>

**Speaker**: 空气中有石棉吗？土壤中有石棉吗？水中有石棉吗？身体里有石棉吗？所有这些计数规则都基于那些不是超长，但比绝大多数**利比角闪石纤维**和绝大多数吸入纤维长得多的纤维。所以他们甚至没有计算那些，他们甚至没有寻找它们。我们现在告诉人们他们是否暴露的方式是一个谎言！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Is there asbestos in the air? Is there asbestos in the soil? Is there asbestos in the water? Is there asbestos in the body? All of those counting rules are based on fibers that are not super-long, but they're way longer than the vast majority of say, Libby amphibole fibers and the vast majority of fibers that are inhaled. So they're not even counting those, they're not even looking for them. The ways that we are right now telling people whether they're being exposed or not is a lie!

</details>

**Gregor**: 当较长的纤维断裂形成所谓的**解理碎片**时，它们也不算数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: And when longer fibers break forming these so-called cleavage fragments, they don't count either.

</details>

**Speaker**: 是的，有一整套努力说：“哦，是的，如果它被破坏了，它就不危险。”但有那么多论文表明，如果你将纯粹的**解理碎片**放入小鼠体内，它们会病得很重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah, there's a whole effort to say, "Oh yeah, if it's been broken, it's not dangerous." But there are so many papers out there that show that if you put pure cleavage fragments into mice, they get very, very sick.

</details>

**Gregor**: 当你身处这样的地方，意识到灰尘在一种定义下可能被认为是石棉污染的，而在另一种定义下则完全安全时，这真的很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: This really matters when you're in a place like this and you realize the dust could be considered asbestos-contaminated under one definition, and perfectly safe under another.

</details>

**Researcher**: 没有人会想到在这里发现石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Researcher**: Nobody would've expected to find asbestos here.

</details>

**Gregor**: 明确地说，**内华达州**没有石棉矿，没有工业场所，完全没有石棉商业使用的历史。但地质学家**布伦达·巴克**和**罗德·梅特卡夫**在**拉斯维加斯**郊外约**100万英亩**的土地上发现了石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: To be clear, there were no asbestos mines in Nevada, no industrial sites, no history of asbestos commercial use at all. But geologists, Brenda Buck and Rod Metcalf found asbestos spread across approximately 1 million acres outside Las Vegas.

</details>

**Rod**: 地质过程会运输这些物质。你知道，在侵蚀开始之前，它们只是沿着山前的基岩。现在它们在下面的沉积物中，在这里的溪流中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rod**: Geologic processes transport these materials. And you know, before the erosion started, they were just in the bedrocks along the mountain front. Now they're in sediments down they're, in the stream here.

</details>

**Brenda**: 像这种天然存在的物质的问题是，它在岩石中可能只占很小的百分比，在土壤中甚至更小，但这些物质会进入空气中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brenda**: And the problem with the naturally occurring stuff like this is it may be only a small percentage in the rock and even a smaller percentage in the soil, but this stuff gets in the air.

</details>

**Gregor**: 整个社区可能在不知情的情况下吸入它并生病。所以**布伦达**和**罗德**试图警告人们。早在2012年末，他们整理了所有发现，准备在**美国地质学会会议**上进行演示。但在会议开始之前，摘要就引起了一位记者的注意，他报道了这个故事，然后反弹就开始了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Entire communities might be breathing it in and getting sick without knowing. So Brenda and Rod tried to warn people. Back in late 2012, they compiled all of their findings for a presentation at the Conference of the Geological Society of America. But before the conference even began, the abstract caught the attention of a journalist who reported on the story, and that's when the pushback started.

</details>

**Gregor**: 很快，**内华达州**发出了**停止函**，官员们质疑**布伦达**和**罗德**的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Soon the state of Nevada sent a cease and desist letter, and officials questioned Brenda and Rod's methods.

</details>

**Speaker**: 所以如果你去**拉斯维加斯**，你就会接触到他们不想让外界知道的石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: So if you go to Las Vegas, you're gonna get exposed to asbestos that they didn't want that out there.

</details>

**Speaker**: 每次我开车进入**博尔德城**，一分钟内就会有一个官员跟着我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Every time I drove into Boulder City, there was an official tailing me within a minute.

</details>

**Speaker**: 信息很明确，不要再深入调查了。好吧，我们决定深入调查。所以我们开车进入沙漠，到一个热门的越野地点，测试**拉斯维加斯**周围的灰尘中是否真的含有石棉。好的，我被绑在**沙滩车**上。我要开到那个盆地里，**肖恩**在我的呼吸区绑了一些**集尘器**和接收器，这样我们就可以实际计算出我通过扬起的灰尘会吸入多少石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The message was clear, don't look any further. Well, we did decide to look further. So we drove out into the desert to a popular off-roading spot to test whether there really is asbestos in the dust around Las Vegas. Okay, I'm strapped into a dune buggy here. I'm going to go down in that basin, and Sean's strapped up some dust collectors with receivers in my breathing zone so we can actually figure out how much asbestos I would be inhaling through the dust that I kick up.

</details>

**Gregor**: 呜！你看到那些甜甜圈了吗，嗯？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Woo! You see those donuts, huh?

</details>

**Sean**: 是的，是的，你在下面玩得很嗨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: Yeah, yeah, you were ripping it up down there.

</details>

**Gregor**: 是的，从地质学的角度来看，有什么发现吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Yeah, from a geological point of view, any notes?

</details>

**Sean**: 今天下雨了。我在看的时候想到了这一点，我想：“可能没有太多灰尘。”但这些是挂在你呼吸区的空气样本，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: It rained today. I thought about that while I was watching, I was like, "There might not be much dust," but these are the air samples that were hanging in your breathing room, right?

</details>

**Speaker**: 是的，是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yes, yeah, yeah.

</details>

**Sean**: 我看了看它们，过滤器上有一些棕色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: And I looked at them and the filters have some tanning on them.

</details>

**Speaker**: 哦，那太好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Oh, that's good.

</details>

**Sean**: 这意味着我们确实收集到了一些灰尘。我们还不知道里面有什么，但肯定有东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: Which means we actually did get some dust. We don't know what's in it yet, but there's something in there.

</details>

**Gregor**: 但我们最初的计划是实际上在**博尔德城**外的**干涸湖床**上做这个，因为那里是人们进行大部分越野活动的地方，你知道，他们露营，他们拍照，甚至拍婚纱照，除了我们去的那天。好的，我们现在在**拉斯维加斯**的**干涸湖床**上，据说在我们去的那天，湖决定不再是干涸的，无论从任何意义上来说。哦，我的天哪。所以我们要做的就是穿上防护服，采集一些样本，然后弄清楚这些东西里到底有多少石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But the original plan was for us to actually do this at the dry lake bed just outside Boulder City, because this is where people do the majority of their off-roading, you know, they camp, they do photo shoots, even take their wedding photos, except not on the day that we were there. Okay, we're out here on the dry lake bed, supposedly in Las Vegas, where on the one day that we're here, the lake has decided not to be dry in any sort of definition. Oh my God. And so what we're gonna go do is suit up, get some samples, and figure out how much asbestos there really is in this stuff.

</details>

**Sean**: 好的。我们要再做一次。我们去那个岛上。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: Okay. We're gonna do a third. Let's go out to that island. Okay.

</details>

**Speaker**: 好的，拿到样本了。下一步，把它们带到实验室。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Okay, got the samples. Next step, take 'em to the lab.

</details>

**Speaker**: 很高兴再次见到你们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Great to see you guys again.

</details>

**Gregor**: 是的，也很高兴见到你。嗯，我想我们来这里是为了同一件事，就是我们得到了什么样的结果？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Yeah, good to see you too. Well, we are here for one thing I suppose, like what kind of results did we get?

</details>

**Speaker**: 现在揭晓答案，请敲鼓。我首先做了**沙滩车**的空气样本。你左右肩膀上的那些样本，我没有发现任何石棉纤维。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Now the big reveal, drum roll please. I did the dune buggy air samples first. Those samples that you had on your left and right shoulders, I didn't find any asbestos fibers.

</details>

**Gregor**: 好的，嗯，我想这有点令人欣慰。我很高兴我们做了演示，我也很高兴我们没有发现任何东西，因为我非常确定我在几个地方摘下了口罩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Okay, well, I guess that's a bit of a relief. I'm glad we did the demonstration and I'm kind of glad we didn't find anything because I'm pretty sure I took my mask off at a few points.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我也有过那种经历，比如，我们什么也没找到。哦，但是等等，我当时正在呼吸那个（哔）。（笑）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I've been in those shoes, like, we didn't find anything. Oh, but wait a minute, I was breathing that (beep). (laughing)

</details>

**Gregor**: 完全正确。（轻笑）那么**干涸湖床**的样本呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Exactly. (chuckling) So what about the samples in the dry lake bed?

</details>

**Speaker**: 啊，再敲鼓。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Ah, another drum roll.

</details>

**Gregor**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Okay.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我发现了**角闪石石棉**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I found amphibole asbestos.

</details>

**Gregor**: 哇，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Wow, okay.

</details>

**Speaker**: 它就在那里。它确实在那里。我数了一下纤维的数量，他们分析了过滤器的面积，我发现我们走过的每克泥土中含有**3000万到5000万个石棉结构**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It's there. It is there. I counted up a number of fibers, the area of the filter they analyzed, and I figured out that we had between 30 and 50 million asbestos structures per gram of mud that we were walking through.

</details>

**Gregor**: 哇。想想看，我们只是把车停在路边，走了大约30米，采集了三个样本，所有这些样本都含有如此高浓度的石棉，我们甚至不需要特意去寻找。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Whoa. Just to think that we pulled off to the side of the road, walked what, 30 meters, took three samples, and all of them had these incredibly high concentrations of asbestos right there, it's not like we had to go out and find.

</details>

**Speaker**: 对。非常湿润的土壤对我们来说是幸运的，因为我们知道那片土壤里有石棉。现在想想那些在湖床干涸时开着吉普车穿过那里的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Right. Very wet soil was lucky for us because we know there's asbestos in that soil. Now think about the guys that go taking their jeep across there when it is a dry lake.

</details>

**Gregor**: 我的意思是，那是我们最初的计划，在那里开**沙滩车**。我忍不住想，人们总是开车经过那条路。他们肯定会靠边停车，肯定会下去，然后扬起灰尘和石块——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: I mean, that was our initial plan to do the dune bugging there. And I can't like help but think about people drive down that road all the time. They must pull over, they must go down there, like just kick dust and rocks and-

</details>

**Sean**: 我们知道他们会。我们知道他们会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: We know they do. We know they do.

</details>

**Gregor**: 而且没有标志告诉你**干涸湖床**有什么问题。这不像我们，你知道，发现了这个，这些数据自——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: And there's no sign to tell you that there's anything wrong with the dry lake. It's not like we, you know, discovered this, this has been available data since-

</details>

**Sean**: 2013年10月是**布伦达·巴克**等人发表的《**南内华达州天然石棉对人类暴露的潜在影响**》的实际出版日期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: October of 2013 is the actual publication date of naturally occurring asbestos, potential for human exposure in Southern Nevada by Brenda Buck et al.

</details>

**Gregor**: 所以我们有这些数据已经13年了。这不像我们重新发现了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: So 13 years we've had this data. It's not like we'd rediscovered anything.

</details>

**Sean**: 这就是这门科学的另一个难点。你需要公众知情，但你又不想吓到他们。那么你如何找到正确的方式呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: And that's the other thing that's really hard about this science. You need the public to be aware, but you don't want to terrify them. And so how do you find the right way?

</details>

**Gregor**: 这可能会被数千万人看到。那么你有什么想传达的信息吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: This will potentially be seen by tens of millions of people. So is there a message you want to get out?

</details>

**Sean**: 这是一种自然灾害，就像你生活中的许多事情一样，人们知道自己的房子是否在洪泛区是很好的，对吧？了解地震风险是很好的。了解飓风和龙卷风是很好的。嗯，这只是另一种自然灾害，如果你有这些信息，那么你就可以做出更好的决定，过上更健康的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: This is a natural hazard, just like a lot of things in your life, it's really good for people to know whether or not their house is in a flooding zone, right? It's really good to know about earthquake risks. It's really good to know about hurricanes and tornadoes. Well, this is just another natural hazard, and if you have the information, then you can make better decisions to live a healthier life.

</details>

### 未解决的问题与全球影响

**Gregor**: 一个大问题是现实世界中的石棉与它的监管方式不符。以这根纤维为例，它来自我们视频开头参观的**拉斯维加斯**郊外现场的同一种**蓝石棉**样本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: One big problem is that asbestos in the real world doesn't line up with how it's regulated. Take this fiber, it comes from a sample of the same blue asbestos from the site outside Las Vegas we visited at the start of the video.

</details>

**Sean**: 我认为我们这里至少有两种不同的**角闪石相**，因为如果它在这个方向是黄色的，但在同一纤维束的这个方向是蓝色的，那么我们就有了从这里到这里的相变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean**: I think we have two different phases, at least of amphibole here because if it's yellow in this orientation, but also blue in this orientation in the same fiber bundle, then we have a change in the phase from here to here.

</details>

**Gregor**: 所以这根纤维实际上是两种矿物。这种复杂性也体现在其结构中，在**电子显微镜**下，一面可能符合石棉的定义，而另一面可能仅仅因为其形状而不符合。所以一根纤维可能在一面符合六种命名和受监管的石棉矿物之一，但另一面则完全不受监管。然而，你的肺部并不关心这些类别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: So this one fiber is actually two minerals. And that complexity shows up in its structure too, under the electron microscope, one side could meet the definition of asbestos, the other may not simply because of its shape. So one single fiber could fall within one of the six named and regulated asbestos minerals if you look at one side, but the other would be completely unregulated. Your lungs don't care about these categories, though.

</details>

**Narrator**: 石棉纤维，你会在任何地方找到它。它不是普通的岩石，实际上也不是单一的岩石，而是一组相关的矿物，它们具有共同的特性，但程度不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: The asbestos fiber, you'll find it everywhere. No ordinary rock, no single rock indeed, but a group of related minerals with characteristics in common, but in varying degrees,

</details>

**Speaker**: 大多数专家会说：“石棉不是矿物或地质术语，它是一个商业术语。”但那是象征性的。我为什么这么说？因为它不仅仅是一个商业术语。我们现在知道石棉会致人死亡。所以如果我们要这么说，我们必须根据健康影响来定义它，但我们没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Most experts will say, "Asbestos isn't a mineral or a geologic term, it's a commercial one," but that's symbolics. Why do I say that? Because it's not just a commercial term. We now know that asbestos can kill you. So if we're gonna say that, we have to define it based on health effect, and we don't.

</details>

**Gregor**: 那么我们到底在做什么呢？这个系统如此复杂，如此繁重，以至于我们的国家甚至无法维持对石棉的禁令，这种已知的致癌物每年导致多达**10000名美国人**死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: So what are we actually doing about it? The system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos, a known carcinogen that kills as many as 10,000 Americans every year.

</details>

**Gregor**: 嗯，2016年，**国会**确实试图修复这个破损的系统。他们通过了一项修正案，赋予**EPA**新的权力来评估和限制危险化学品，包括石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Well, in 2016, Congress did try to fix this broken system. They passed an amendment giving the EPA new power to evaluate and restrict dangerous chemicals, including asbestos.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我认为现在是时候签署《**弗兰克·R·拉登堡21世纪化学品安全法案**》并使其成为法律了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I think it's time to sign the Frank R. Ladenburg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act into law.

</details>

**Gregor**: 但随后进展再次停滞。在**特朗普政府**时期，加强石棉规则的努力急剧放缓。**特朗普**多年来一直公开赞扬石棉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But then progress stalled, again. Under the Trump administration, efforts to strengthen asbestos rules slowed dramatically. Trump had publicly praised asbestos for years.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我所在行业的很多人认为石棉是有史以来最伟大的防火材料！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: A lot of people in my industry think asbestos is the greatest fireproofing material ever, ever made!

</details>

**Gregor**: 直到2024年，美国才最终禁止了**温石棉**。但这项禁令不包括其他五种石棉，而且仍然允许一些制造商有长达**12年**的时间来逐步淘汰它。它没有解决如何处理学校、家庭和其他建筑物中已有的石棉，也没有修复任何众多的分类、识别和检测漏洞，它也没有解决环境中的石棉问题。最重要的是，**EPA**再次被起诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: It wasn't until 2024 that the US finally banned chrysotile asbestos. But this ban doesn't cover the other five types of asbestos, and it still allows some manufacturers up to 12 years to phase it out. It doesn't address what to do with asbestos already in schools and homes and other buildings, nor does it fix any of the numerous classification, identification, and detection loopholes, and it doesn't address the asbestos in the environment. On top of that, the EPA is already getting sued, again.

</details>

**Speaker**: 商业行业施加了巨大的压力，使其听起来没有那么糟糕，并寻找方法允许他们继续使用这种材料。这是我们国家和其他国家决策中一个可悲的事实，那就是它是由金钱驱动的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: There have been tremendous forces from commercial industries to make it sound like it's not as bad as it is, and to find ways to allow them to continue to use the material. This is a sad, sad fact of our decision-making in our country and other countries, is that it's driven by money.

</details>

**Gregor**: 但至少美国正在寻求某种程度的适度。其他国家就没有那么幸运了。2019年，**印度**进口了超过**35万吨石棉**，预计在未来几十年，那里将有**600万人**可能患上石棉相关疾病。类似的事情也发生在许多其他**亚洲国家**。我们实际上发现了一个网站，看起来你可以在那里购买**中国制造**的石棉布，但请不要这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: But at least the United States are going for some level of moderation. Other countries are not that lucky. In 2019, India imported more than 350,000 tons of asbestos, and it's predicted that in the upcoming decades, 6 million people there might develop asbestos-related diseases. And similar things are happening in many of the other countries in Asia. We've actually found this website where it looks like you can just buy asbestos cloth made in China, but please don't.

</details>

**Gregor**: 而且我们已经开采的所有石棉，即使我们停止使用它，它仍然存在。石棉在环境中不会自然衰变。那么你应该担心吗？嗯，家里有石棉并不自动意味着它很危险。如果你的天花板里有石棉，而且你不去钻它，你可能就会没事。如果颗粒物进入空气中，石棉就会成为问题，但谁知道哪家房子有石棉，所有这些石棉在哪里，谁来处理它，以及如何处理？所以这些问题的许多答案都还没有。但如果你担心自己接触石棉，请查看我们在描述中提供的链接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: And all of the asbestos that we've already mined, even after we stop using it, it's still out there. Asbestos doesn't naturally decay in the environment. So should you be worried? Well, having asbestos in your house doesn't automatically mean that it's dangerous. If you have asbestos in your ceiling and you don't drill into it, you're probably gonna be fine. Asbestos is an issue if the particles go airborne, but who knows which house has asbestos, where all of that asbestos is, who's gonna take care of it and how? So a lot of the answers to these questions just don't exist yet. But if you're worried about asbestos exposure for yourself, check out the links that we've put in the description.

### 结论：面对真相

**Gregor**: 我认为问题很大一部分在于人们认为石棉是一个已解决的问题。我将是第一个承认，我曾陷入这种思维定式。这是我为我们的**PFAS**视频写的结尾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: I think a big part of the problem is that people assume asbestos is a solved issue. And I'll be the first to admit, I fell for that line of thinking. Here's the ending I wrote for our PFAS video.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我们以前也遇到过**含铅汽油**、**氟利昂**和石棉的问题，每次我们都做了研究，并做出了正确的决定，逐步淘汰这些化学品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: We've been here before with lead gasoline, Freon and asbestos, and each time we did the research and made the right decision to phase these chemicals out.

</details>

**Gregor**: 是的，我完全没有意识到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Yeah, I was completely oblivious.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我们会回顾我们的历史，我们对烟草做了什么？每个人都在吸烟，对吧？即使我当时不吸烟，不提供烟灰缸也是不合适的。所有为大型香烟公司工作的科学家都说：“烟草从来没有伤害过任何人。”但由于公众的强烈抗议和对吸烟导致疾病的认识，每个人都知道有人死于香烟，对吧？现在，你可能会发现石棉相关疾病以某种方式影响了你，你甚至还不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: We will look back at our history and what do we do with tobacco? Everybody was smoking, right? It would be improper for me to not offer an ashtray even if I wasn't a smoker back in the day. And all the scientists working for the big cigarette companies said, "Why, tobacco never hurt anybody." But because of the outcry and the recognition that smoking causes disease, everybody knows someone who died because of cigarettes, right? Now, you might find out that asbestos-related diseases has touched you in some way, you don't even know yet.

</details>

**Speaker**: 我不知道我的祖父死于石棉，我的父亲很可能死于石棉。当我开始在显微镜下观察石棉时，我知道吗？不。当我更换我开的**吉普车**的刹车时，我知道吗？不。当我穿过含有石棉的灰尘时，我知道吗？不。现在我知道了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I didn't know my grandfather died because of asbestos, that my father is dying more likely than not because of asbestos. Did I know that when I started looking at asbestos under a microscope, no. Did I know that when I changed the brakes on the Jeeps that I ran around in, no. Did I know that when I ran around through asbestos-containing dust, no. Now I do.

</details>

**Gregor**: 几乎所有我们为这个视频采访的科学家和记者都说了同样的话。这是一个很难被公开的故事。他们面临经济压力、政治压力，研究被埋藏，有些人甚至因为报道这个故事而收到死亡威胁。这是一个令人不舒服的话题，但我认为正是这些令人不舒服的话题最重要，它们最有潜力做好事，然而它们也是最令人不舒服的观看内容。所以我非常感谢你们坚持到最后，面对真相，让自己了解情况，并成为解决方案的一部分。所以，也许现在比以往任何时候都更感谢你们的观看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregor**: Pretty much every scientist and journalist we spoke to for this video said the same thing. This is a hard story to get out there. They've faced economic pressure, political pressure, the research got buried, and some people even received death threats for reporting on the story. It is an uncomfortable topic, but I think it's these uncomfortable topics that matter the most, that have the potential to do the most good, yet they are also the ones that are the most uncomfortable to watch. So I really appreciate you for sticking around to the end and facing the truth, making yourself aware and becoming part of the solution. So perhaps now more than ever, thank you for watching.
