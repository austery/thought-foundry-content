### 新闻头条

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是本周新闻头条。我是特蕾西·曼福德。今天是1月23日，星期五。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, January 23rd. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

### TikTok交易

**Tracy Mumford**: 经过一场高风险、旷日持久的法律拉锯战，拥有 **TikTok** 的中国公司已达成一项协议，将创建一个新的美国版社交媒体应用。根据这项协议，公司 **ByteDance** 已引入了一批非中国投资者，他们将负责管理该平台面向其超过 **2亿** 美国用户。以下是关于这项交易需要了解的三件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: After a highstakes, yearslong legal saga, the Chinese company that owns TikTok has struck a deal to create a new US version of the social media app. Under the agreement, the company ByteDance has brought in a group of non-Chinese investors who will now help run the platform for its 200 million plus American users. Here are three things to know about the deal.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 第一，为什么会有这项交易？早在疫情期间，随着该应用人气飙升，美国立法者开始担心它可能构成国家安全风险，因为中国政府可能能够访问美国人的个人信息或向他们推送宣传。这最终导致了一项法律，该法律本应在去年年初禁止TikTok，除非它与ByteDance剥离。但特朗普总统多次推迟了该法律的执行，同时他亲自参与组建了一个新的投资者安排。那么，第二件需要了解的事情是：这些投资者是谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: First, why is there a deal at all? Back in the pandemic, as the app surged in popularity, US lawmakers started to worry that it could be a national security risk with the Chinese government potentially able to access personal information about Americans or feed them propaganda. That eventually led to a law that was supposed to have banned TikTok if it didn't break off from ByteDance by early last year. But President Trump delayed enforcement of that law multiple times while he got personally involved in putting together a new arrangement of investors. So the second thing to know who are those investors?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: ByteDance 实际上仍然是最大的参与者，拥有新合资公司约 20% 的股份。其他主要股东包括一些大型投资公司以及云计算巨头 **Oracle**。其中几位新所有者与特朗普有联系，例如 Oracle 的亿万富翁首席执行官 **Larry Ellison**，他曾多次访问白宫。这是埃里森家族在美国新闻和娱乐领域影响力迅速扩张的最新例证。目前，拉里和他的儿子大卫控制着包括 CBS 在内的派拉蒙公司，并正在争夺华纳兄弟探索频道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: ByteDance is still actually the biggest player owning about 20% of the new venture. Other leading stakeholders include some major investment firms and Oracle the cloud computing giant. Several of those new owners have ties to Trump, like Oracle's billionaire CEO Larry Ellison, who's made frequent visits to the White House. It is the latest example of the Ellison family's rapidly expanding influence over news and entertainment in the US. At this point, Larry and his son David control Paramount, which includes CBS, and are making a play for Warner Brothers Discovery.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 第三件事，这对 TikTok 用户意味着什么？简短的回答是，现在说还为时过早。你不需要下载一个新应用，ByteDance 仍将向美国版的 TikTok 授权其强大的推荐算法。但是，新的所有者将有权审核应用上的内容，决定哪些视频可以保留或删除。这引起了一些专家和 TikTok 用户的担忧，他们担心新所有者可能会试图影响人们看到的内容，可能会展示更多符合特朗普政府观点的帖子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And the third thing, what does this all mean for people who use TikTok? The short answer, it is too early to tell. You do not have to download a new app, and ByteDance will still be licensing its powerful recommendation algorithm to the American TikTok. But the new ownership will have the power to moderate content on the app, deciding which videos to leave up or take down. That's raised concerns among some experts and TikTok users that the new owners could try to influence what people see, potentially showing more posts aligned with the Trump administration's views.

</details>

### 明尼苏达抗议

**Tracy Mumford**: 我们将不购物，不工作，不回学校。今天是1月23日，星期五。今天在明尼苏达州……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: We are not going to shop. We are not going to work. We are not going to school on Friday, January 23rd. Today in Minnesota,

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: ……我们关闭了星期五商场的所有生意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> we are shut down all the business in Mall 24 on Friday.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 据预计，该州将有数百家企业关闭，作为反对特朗普政府加强移民执法行动的一般性罢工的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Hundreds of businesses are expected to close across the state as part of a general strike in protest of the Trump administration's ramped up immigration enforcement.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 不要上班，不要花一分钱。我们不去美国购物中心，不去汉堡王。我们什么都不做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Don't show up to work. Don't spend no kind of money. We ain't going to the Mall of America. We're not going to no Burger King. We ain't doing none of that.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 这发生之际，居民们几周来一直在反击联邦特工的涌入。政府已派出多达 3000 人，他们的行动导致数千人被捕，至少发生两起枪击事件，包括 **ICE**（美国移民及海关执法局）官员击毙 **Renee Good**。当地官员称此次部署为“入侵”，因为特工们已渗透到各社区，并采取了侵略性策略，砸碎汽车车窗，向人们脸上喷洒胡椒喷雾。有一次，他们把一个后来被证实是美国公民的男人从他家里拖出来，当时他只穿着内裤，在雪地里。在另一件本周引起全国关注的案件中，他们拘留了一名 5 岁的男孩，当时他正和父亲一起放学回家。学校官员说，他是该学区近期被拘留的第四名儿童。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> It comes as motans have been pushing back for weeks on the surge of federal agents there. The government has sent as many as 3,000 and their operation has led to thousands of arrests and at least two shootings, including the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer. Local officials have called the deployment an invasion as agents have fanned out in neighborhoods and used aggressive tactics, breaking car windows and deploying pepper spray in people's faces. At one point, they dragged a man who turned out to be a US citizen out of his house in his underwear in the snow. In another case that's gotten national attention this week, they detained a 5-year-old boy as he was coming home from prek with his dad. School officials said he was the fourth child in the district to be detained recently.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 大家下午好，你们好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Good afternoon, everybody. How we doing?

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 鉴于该州局势紧张，副总统 **J. D. Vance** 昨天前往双子城。我想与商界领袖、ICE 官员、当地执法部门会面，以便更好地了解正在发生的事情，这样我们就可以稍微缓和一下气氛，减少混乱，但仍然……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> With the state on edge, Vice President J. D. Vance traveled to the Twin Cities yesterday. I wanted to meet with business leaders, with ICE officers, with local law enforcement to try to understand a little bit better what's going on so that we can tone down the temperature a little bit, reduce the chaos, but still

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: Vance 表示，他认为联邦特工们做得“非常出色”，并且城市的动荡是州和地方官员未能合作的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Vance said that he thought federal agents were doing a quote incredible job, and that the unrest in the city was the result of a failure of cooperation by state and local officials.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 在对示威活动的另一次更新中，**司法部**逮捕了三名在圣保罗一家教堂进行示威的人，他们要求一名牧师辞职，因为他们认为他为 ICE 工作。这是联邦政府直接下令逮捕非暴力抗议者的罕见情况。**特朗普**总统在网上写道，他看到了他们打断教堂礼拜仪式的视频，并说：“他们是麻烦制造者，应该被关进监狱或驱逐出境。”司法部还试图起诉前 CNN 记者 **Don Lemon**，他当时在现场报道此事，但消息人士告诉《泰晤士报》，一名联邦治安法官拒绝批准该刑事诉讼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: In another update on the protests, the Justice Department arrested three people over a demonstration at a church in St. Paul after they went there to demand that one of the pastors resign, believing he works for ICE. It's a rare instance of the federal government directing the arrests of nonviolent protesters. President Trump wrote online that he'd seen footage of them interrupting the church service, saying, quote, "They are troublemakers who should be thrown in jail or thrown out of the country." The Justice Department also tried to charge former CNN journalist Don Lemon, who was at the scene reporting on it, but sources tell the Times a federal magistrate judge refused to approve that criminal complaint.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 与此同时，一项新的 Time Sienna 民意调查显示，虽然约一半的选民支持特朗普总统的驱逐政策，但 61% 的人认为 ICE 的策略“太过分了”。这其中包括近五分之一的共和党人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: Meanwhile, a new Time Sienna poll shows that while roughly half of voters support President Trump's deportations, 61% said ICE had gone quote too far in their tactics. That includes nearly one in five Republicans.

</details>

### 严峻天气预报

**Tracy Mumford**: 嗯，我们一直在等待冬季天气，而我们将在本周末迎来它。这席卷了整个美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Well, we have waited for winter weather and boy are we going to get it going into this weekend. We are across the US.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 北德克萨斯州大片地区已发布冬季风暴警报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Wintertorm watch is now up for a large portion of North Texas.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 人们正在为一场重大的冬季风暴做准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> People are bracing for a major winter storm.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 密苏里州的道路维护人员正在为这些风暴做准备。它可能以雪和冻雨的混合形式影响近一半的美国人口。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Road crews in Missouri are out preparing for these storms. It could hit almost half the country's population with a mix of snow and sleet.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 我敢肯定，纽约和我们整个走廊地区将是下一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> I am sure New York and our entire corridor here is going to be next.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 风暴预计将于今天下午在落基山脉开始，并在周末向东横扫全国。气象学家说，一些地区可能会有超过一英尺的降雪，之后是剧烈的冰冻。例如，北达科他州的风寒可能低至零下 50 度。一位气象学家告诉《泰晤士报》：“人类走出门外将是危险的。”更南边，主要担忧的是冻雨。州和地方官员正在为树木、电线和道路可能被厚冰覆盖的可能性做准备，这会导致交通延误。人们还担心电网。专家们正在将此次情况与 5 年前发生在德克萨斯州的一场大规模冬季风暴进行比较，那场风暴导致大范围停电，并造成约 200 人死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> The storm is expected to get going this afternoon in the Rockies before moving east across the country over the weekend. Meteorologists say some regions could get a foot or more of snow and after that an intense freeze. The wind chill in North Dakota, for example, could drop as low as -50°. One meteorologist told the Times, "It's going to be hazardous for humans to step outside." Further south, the big concern is freezing rain. State and local officials are preparing for the possibility of trees, power lines, and roads being covered in heavy ice causing travel delays. There's also concern about the power grid. Experts are drawing comparisons to another massive winter storm in Texas 5 years ago that led to extensive blackouts and left around 200 people dead.

</details>

### 犯罪率下降

**Tracy Mumford**: 对全国犯罪数据的一项新分析指出了一项值得注意的里程碑。2025 年很可能将成为一个世纪以来凶杀率最低的一年。根据对数字进行分析的无党派刑事司法委员会的数据，这一下降是多年来暴力犯罪总体下降的一部分。除了疫情期间的短暂激增外，专家们表示，犯罪率下降没有一个明确的答案，但他们有广泛的猜测。一些人认为这是因为 70 年代淘汰了含铅汽油，含铅汽油会损害大脑发育。其他可能的因素包括：监控摄像头的日益普及、新的警务技术、为青少年提供暑期工作的更多项目、更好的心理健康治疗，或者甚至是中国人口的老龄化。一位研究犯罪的教授告诉《泰晤士报》，像屏幕时间增加这样的习惯改变也可能在其中发挥作用，他说美国社会“越来越不面对面了，而这对于暴力来说是一种要求。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: A new analysis of crime data from across the country is pointing to a remarkable milestone. 2025 will likely register as having the lowest national homicide rate in more than a century. According to the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice, which crunched the numbers, the drop is part of an overall decrease in violent crime that's been happening for years. Apart from a temporary surge during the pandemic, experts say there's no one clear answer for why crime rates have been falling, but they have a wide range of educated guesses. Some point to the phasing out of lead gasoline back in the 70s, which had impaired brain development. Some other possible factors, the growing use of surveillance cameras, new policing techniques, more programs that give teenagers summer jobs, better mental health treatment, or even the country's aging population. One professor who studies crime told the Times that changing habits like more screen time could also be playing a role, saying American society is quote becoming much less face to face, which is sort of a requirement for violence.

### 奥斯卡提名

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally,

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 你一直在与魔鬼共舞。有一天他会跟着你回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> you keep dancing with the devil. One day he's going to follow you home.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 今年奥斯卡提名的一大亮点是，吸血鬼电影《**Sinners**》打破了有史以来获得最多提名的纪录，超越了之前的《**Titanic**》、《**La La Land**》和《**All About Eve**》三部影片并列的纪录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> The big wow out of the Oscar nominations this year was that the vampire movie Sinners broke the record for most nominations ever, beating out the previous three-way tie of Titanic, La La Land, and All About Eve.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 谢谢你，SENSEI。谢谢。革命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Thank you, SENSEI. THANK YOU. REVOLUTION.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 电影《**One Battle After Another**》，讲述了一个草根团队奋起反抗威权主义的故事，紧随其后。这两部都是好莱坞现在大多不再制作的那种电影。大制作的原创故事，而不是续集、衍生剧等。事实上，最初支持《Sinners》和《One Battle After Another》的制片厂高管们，因为承担这些风险而普遍被认为会丢掉工作。根据《泰晤士报》的流行文化记者 **Kyle Buchanan** 的说法，最大的遗珠是《**Wicked**》续集颗粒无收，零提名，尽管第一部获得了不少提名。而根据凯尔的说法，另一部重要的影片是 **F1**，这部赛车电影，由 **Brad Pitt** 主演，他开得飞快，还脱了上衣，获得了最佳影片提名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> The movie One Battle After Another about a scrappy crew rising up against authoritarianism was close behind. Both are the kind of movies Hollywood has mostly stopped making. Big budget original stories instead of sequels, spin-offs, etc. In fact, the studio executives who originally backed Sinners and one battle after another were widely expected to lose their jobs for taking those swings. The biggest snub in the nominations, according to the Times pop culture reporter Kyle Buchanan, is that the Wicked sequel got none, zero, even after the first installment got a bunch. And one of the major h reallyies, according to Kyle, F1, the race car movie featuring Brad Pitt driving real fast and taking his shirt off, walked away with a best picture nomination.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 你赢了什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Did you win something?

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 呜呜呜。奥斯卡颁奖典礼将于 3 月 15 日举行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> Vroom vroom. The Oscar ceremony will be March 15th.

</details>

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，是时候进行测验了。我们准备了几个关于《泰晤士报》报道过的故事的问题。开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, time for the quiz. We've got a few questions for you about stories the Times has been covering. Here we go.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 首先，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: First up,

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 在格陵兰和丹麦，特朗普总统最近威胁要占领北极岛屿引发了抗议。街上的一些人戴着看起来像特朗普标志性帽子一样的红色帽子，上面确实有相同的 MAGA 首字母缩写，但在这里，M A 代表着别的东西。您的问题是，帽子上写的是什么？提示：它是“让美国……”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> in Greenland and Denmark, President Trump's recent threats to seize the Arctic Island sparked protests. Some of the people out on the streets wore red hats that look like the ones Trump made famous, and they do have the same MAGA initials, but in this case, M A stands for something else. Your question, what do the hats say? A hint, it's make America what

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 答案是，“让美国走开”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: the answer, make America go away.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 当我们制作它时，有趣的是，我们只卖了大约五顶，我送了很多给朋友等等，他们说，“啊，真有趣。” 设计这些帽子的人告诉美联社，他去年首次制作了一批，但直到最近特朗普加强了他的威胁，它们才真正成为畅销品。现在，设计师正试图跟上新一轮的在线订单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> When we made it, funny enough, we sold maybe five and we g I gave a lot of way to friends and so on and they say, "Ah, that's funny." The man who designed the hats told the Associated Press he first made a batch last year, but they weren't really a bestseller until recently when Trump amped up his threats. Now, the designer is trying to keep up with a new flood of online orders.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 下一个问题。在过去几年里，随着 **GLP1 药物**（如 **Ompic**）越来越受欢迎，它们对美国企业产生了意想不到的副作用。快餐公司正在陷入困境，因为人们渴望更少的加工食品，一些婚纱设计师也看到客户在减肥后要求紧急修改的订单激增。现在，一份新报告称，有一个行业尤其可能因此类药物节省数亿美元。是哪个行业？提示：你可能会说，这些美国公司在削减成本方面是团结一致的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next question. In the past few years, as GLP1 drugs like Ompic have become more and more popular, they've had unexpected side effects for American businesses. Junk food companies are scrambling as people crave less processed food, and some wedding dress designers are seeing a surge in customers asking for lastminute alterations after losing weight. Now, a new report says that one industry in particular could potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to the drugs. What industry is it? A hint, you might say these American companies are united on trying to cut costs.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 答案是，**美国航空业**。根据一家金融服务公司的一项研究，该国的四大航空公司，包括美国航空和联合航空，由于乘客体重减轻，每年可以在燃料上节省多达 5.8 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: The answer, the US airline industry. According to the study by a financial services firm, the country's four biggest airlines, including American and United, could save as much as 580 million a year on fuel because of lighter passengers.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 快速的附加题。大约有多少比例的美国人表示他们服用过 GLP-1 药物？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Quick bonus question. Roughly what percentage of Americans say they have taken a GLP-1 drug?

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 答案是，大约 20%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: The answer about 20%.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后一个问题，标志性的时装设计师 **Valentino** 本周去世。在他数十年的职业生涯中，他曾为世界上最著名的女性设计服装。罗马市长曾这样评价他：在意大利，有教皇，也有 Valentino。我将问你几个关于他重大时尚时刻的问题。看看你是否能说出他设计了谁的礼服。这件礼服对我的一生来说非常非常重要。她让我成名于美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And last question, the iconic fashion designer Valentino died this week. Over his decades long career, he dressed some of the most famous women in the world. The mayor of Rome once said about him. In Italy, there is the Pope and there is Valentino. I've got a few questions for you about some of his big fashion moments. See if you can name whose dresses he designed. This dress is something very very important in my life. She make me famous in United States.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 这位前第一夫人结婚时穿着一件奶油色蕾丝 Valentino 礼服，那是在 1968 年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> This former first lady wore a cream lace Valentino dress when she got married again in 1968.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 下一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next one.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 这件红色礼服。她实际上穿着一套红色的紧身衣。我是说，说真的，这太不可思议了。从头到脚都是勃艮第红。勃艮第红。这位时尚偶像在 1992 年与丈夫公开分居期间，穿着他的一件设计作品，这件作品并不完全符合传统的皇室着装规范。而且……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> This red dress. She's actually wearing a red tight. I mean seriously, this is incredible. Head to toe burgundy. Burgundy. This style icon famously wore one of his designs in 1992 amid a very public separation from her husband. And it did not exactly adhere to a traditional royal dress code. And

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 奥斯卡颁给了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> and the Oscar goes to

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 当这位女演员在 2001 年赢得她的第一个奥斯卡奖时，她穿着一件黑白相间的 Valentino 礼服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> when this actress won her first ever Oscar in 2001, she was wearing a black and white Valentino.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 所以我感谢你真的让我感觉……我喜欢这里。所以按顺序来说，是一位第一夫人，一位打破传统皇室着装规范的时尚偶像，以及那位捧回奖杯的女演员，这是一个很大的提示，她扮演了 **Aaron Brokovich**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: >> So I thank you for really making me feel so I love it up here. So that was in order a first lady, a style icon bucking traditional royal dress, and the actress who took home the trophy for, and this is kind of a big hint, playing Aaron Brochovich.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 答案是，**Jackie Onassis** 的婚纱，**Princess Diana** 的及膝勃艮第色礼服，以及 **Julia Roberts** 庆祝她重大胜利的礼服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: The answers, Jackie Onasses in the wedding dress, Princess Diana in a kneelength burgundy number, and Julia Roberts celebrating her big win.

</details>

**News Clip Speaker**: 我就留在这里分享我学到的一个关于 Valentino 的个人最喜欢的趣闻。据称，当他旅行时，他经常带着他心爱的五只巴哥犬一起乘坐他的私人飞机。当他到达目的地时，他的车队里会有一辆专门为巴哥犬准备的车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Clip Speaker**: I'll just leave you here with my personal favorite Valentino fact that I learned. Apparently, when he traveled, he regularly brought five of his beloved pugs along with him on his private jet. And when he got to his destination, there would be a car in his motorcade specifically for the pugs.
