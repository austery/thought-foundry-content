### 委内瑞拉债务市场概览

**Tracy Alloway**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的Odd Lots播客。我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我是**Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: Joe，委内瑞拉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Joe Venezuela.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 委内瑞拉周。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Venezuela week.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们已经讨论了石油市场，现在我们得谈谈债务市场了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So we've done the oil market. Yeah, we got to do the debt market.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们得谈谈债务市场。我对这些一无所知，所以我们必须聊聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We got to do the debt market. I don't know anything about this stuff, so we got to do it.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我之所以喜欢报道债务市场和债券，其中一个原因是，我们习惯于将债券视为合同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: One of the reasons that I really like covering the debt market, bonds, is because I think we're used to thinking of bonds as contracts.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但我总是更喜欢把它们看作故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But I always like to think of them more as stories.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以，它们充满了各种叙事、内在价值和历史。**Margaret Atwood**有一句很棒的话，她写了一整本书叫《**Payback on Debt**》，她将债务描述为“谁欠了什么以及为什么欠”的故事或记忆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, they're full of all these narratives and embedded values and history. And there's actually a great quote from Margaret Atwood. She wrote this whole book called Payback on Debt. and she describes it as a story or a memory of who owes what and why.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当然，如果你谈论的是一个故事或叙事，它们会随着时间而改变，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And of course, if you're talking about a story or a narrative, those can change over time, right?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 绝对是。我的意思是，我只知道，从周六早上和早盘交易开始，我认为现有的违约**委内瑞拉**债务已经反弹了。我认为它上涨了。哦，是的。但我不明白，你知道，你正试图让经济重新运转起来。你要让每个人都为这笔钱买单，这笔钱是由一个被国际社会视为独裁者的人借的。如果说有什么的话，那些促成了他持续崛起的债权人，难道不应该由他们来支付吗？他们不仅不应该得到偿还，难道不应该额外支付委内瑞拉人民，因为他们资助了一个被广泛认为是罪犯的人吗？我们称这个人是毒品恐怖分子，所以我们难道不应该惩罚那些借钱给他的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Absolutely. I mean, so one thing I know is that just since Saturday morning and the early trading, I think the existing defaulted Venezuelan debt that's out there, I think it's rallied. I think it's gone up. Oh, yeah. But I don't understand like, you know, you're trying to get the economy going again. You're going to make everybody pay for this money that was borrowed by someone who the international community regards to be legitimate as a dictator. If anything, shouldn't the creditors that facilitated his ongoing rise, shouldn't they have to pay? Not only should they not get paid back, shouldn't they pay the people of Venezuela extra for having subsidized someone that is widely regarded to be a criminal? We're calling this guy a narot terrorist and yet so it's like shouldn't we punish the people who lent to him?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 也许你该加入重组团队，Joe。不，但这是真的。这就是争论的焦点。所以你说得对，债券已经反弹了。有**委内瑞拉**主权债务，也有**PDVSA**发行的债务，这些债务几年前从每美元5美分涨到了30多美分。所以人们已经在赚钱了。这里的赌注是会进行某种重组，他们会得到更多的钱。当然，债权人，也就是投资者，总是想要更多。与此同时，有一个强有力的论点是，**委内瑞拉**人民的债务负担应该以某种方式减轻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Maybe you should be on the restructuring team joke. No, but it's true. So this is the debate. So you're right. Bonds have rallied. So there's Venezuelan sovereign debt. There's also debt issued by PVESA and those have gone from like 5 cents on the dollar a few years ago to more than 30 cents. So people are already making money. And the bet here is that there is going to be some sort of restructuring and they're going to get more money. And of course, the creditors, the investors always want more. Meanwhile, there's a strong argument that the Venezuelan people should have their debt load alleviated in some way.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我支持负回收率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I'm in favor of a negative recovery.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的，好吧。我们确实请到了最合适的嘉宾来谈论这一切。我们以前请他来过节目，但已经有一段时间了。我们将与**Lee Bukhite**交谈。他现在是一名退休律师。他有40年的法律职业生涯，参与了20多项主权债务重组，包括**希腊**和**伊拉克**的重组，这与我们今天的谈话息息相关。所以，他真的是最合适的嘉宾。Lee，欢迎回到节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay. All right. Well, we really do have the perfect guest to talk about all of this. Uh someone we've had on the show before, but it's been a while. We're going to be speaking with Lee Bukhite. He is a retired lawyer now. He's had a 40-year legal career, worked on more than two dozen sovereign debt restructurings, including Greece and Iraq, and that's going to be relevant to this conversation. So, really the perfect guest. Lee, welcome back to the show.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 谢谢你们，Tracy和Joe。很高兴回来。也许我们先从介绍债权人和**委内瑞拉**实际所欠债务的情况开始。谁拥有这些债券，我们谈论的是多少债务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Thank you, Tracy and Joe. Good to be back. Maybe just to begin, can you sort of set out the scene of the creditors and the debt that Venezuela actually owes? Who owns those bonds and how much debt are we talking about?

</details>

### 委内瑞拉债务构成与违约历史

**Lee Bukhite**: 总的来说，现在**委内瑞拉**的债务可能在1500亿到1700亿美元之间。并非所有这些都是债券。这也是我们应该讨论的问题之一。我们谈论的债券主要是**委内瑞拉共和国**和**PDVSA**的债券，大致各占一半。它们是在**查韦斯**和**马杜罗**执政初期发行的。所有这些债券都在2017年秋季违约。你们还记得**特朗普**先生在他的第一个任期内于2017年8月对**委内瑞拉**实施了制裁。结果是债券违约，此后一直处于违约状态。**委内瑞拉**在重组其所谓的“遗留债务存量”时将面临的困难之一是，还有各种其他形式的负债，它们不是债券。例如，有未支付的贸易债权人，有仲裁裁决的持有人，这些都是大额仲裁裁决，还有一些人在**委内瑞拉**有被冻结的存款。因此，重组，如果发生的话，将不会是我们习惯的那种简单的、同质化的重组，即只有债券或以前的银行贷款。这将是一个更加多样化的债权人群体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: In total, probably now the Venezuelan debt is someplace between 150 and 170 billion. Not all of that is bombs. And that's one of the issues that we should discuss. The bonds that we're talking about are principally Republic of Venezuela and Pedabvesa bonds roughly split 5050. They were issued during the Chavez and early Maduro periods. They went into default all of them in the fall of 2017. You remember Mr. Trump in his first term imposed sanctions on Venezuela in August of 2017. The response was to have the bonds go into default and they have remained in default since then. One of the difficulties that Venezuela will face in restructuring its what I call legacy debt stock is that there are all kinds of other liabilities that are not in the form of bonds. So there are unpaid trade creditors, there are holders of arbitration awards, chunky arbitration awards, there are people with blocked deposits in Venezuela. And so the restructuring when and if it comes will not be the simple homogeneous kind of restructuring that we're used to where there are bonds or in the old days bank loans. This is going to be a much more diverse creditor group.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是否存在一种正式的层级结构，无论是成文法还是惯例，能够确定当存在多种工具时，谁先得到偿付？还是说，这取决于每个国家的具体情况，以及那些不一定以成文法形式存在的惯例，将有助于确定这种偿付顺序？我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Is there a formal hierarchy that exists either in written law or in norms that sort of establish who comes first when we have these multitude of instruments or is it the type of thing where the conditions of each country depending on what they are etc. And maybe the conventions, not necessarily written down the same way in formal law, will help sort of determine that waterfall. I suppose

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 法律上没有，但惯例上，多边机构，如**国际货币基金组织**（**IMF**）、**世界银行**、**美洲开发银行**等提供的债务被视为优先债权人。因此，它们不会以正式意义上的方式进行重组。一旦你从那个层面下来，就是政府债务。所以，你知道，**法国**、**德国**、**美国**等国家通常为了鼓励出口而提供的债务，然后是商业债务，这可以是债券、银行贷款和各种其他类型的债务，它们都享有同等地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: nothing in law, but in convention, debts extended by the multilateral institutions, the IMF, the World Bank, the Interamerican Development Bank, that sort of thing are treated as preferred creditors. So they will not be restructured in a formal sense. Once you come down from that level then you have government debts. So you know debts extended by France, Germany, the United States typically for export encouragement and then commercial debts and that can be bonds, bank loans and these various other sorts of things they all rank equally.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。现在，政府债权人希望你相信他们拥有某种中间的优先权，但实际上他们没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay. Now, the government creditors would like you to believe that they have some kind of intermediate seniority, but in fact, they don't.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: Joe在情绪激动的开场白中提到了这一点，但是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, Joe touched on this in his emotional intro, but

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我没想到会这么激动，但就像，我们称这个人是毒品恐怖分子，而我们却必须偿还他的债务。这太荒谬了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I wasn't expecting to get so agitated, but it's like, we're calling this guy a narot terrorist and we they have to pay back his debts. It's ridiculous.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这里存在不一致。当然。Lee，关于“可憎债务”的旧论点呢？这种观点认为，如果债务是由一个可憎政权或某种非法政权发行的，那么也许根本就不必偿还。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: There's an inconsistency there. Sure. Lee, what about the old odious debt argument? this idea that if debt is issued by I guess an odious regime or an illegitimate regime of some sort then maybe you don't have to pay it back at all.

</details>

### “可憎债务”原则的争议

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的，Tracy，这是一个非常敏感的领域。国际法非常严格地规定，政府继承其前任的义务。无论一个政府的政治理念与另一个政府有多么不同。所以，1917年**布尔什维克**取代**沙皇**。国际法规定**布尔什维克**必须履行债务。**拿破仑·波拿巴**也履行了他所继承的**波旁王朝**君主的债务。对此的例外情况非常有限。其中一个在20世纪初首次被讨论的就是“可憎债务”。在其最初的表述中，这意味着一个独裁政权所欠的债务，其收益未用于债务国公民的利益，并且债权人知道或应该知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah, this is a very sensitive area Tracy. International law is very strict in saying that governments succeed to inherit the obligations of their predecessors. No matter how different in political philosophy one administration may be from another. So the boleviks take over from the zar in 1917. International law says the boleviks have got to honor the debt. Napoleon Bonapart honored the debts of the bourbon monarchs that he followed. The exception there are very limited exceptions to that. One of them that was first talked about in the early part of the 20th century was odious debts. In its original formulation, that meant a debt incurred by a dictatorial regime where the proceeds were not used for the benefit of the citizenry of the debtor country and where the creditor knew or should have known

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 独裁者会窃取这笔钱。所以，这是一个相当狭窄的范畴。它在2003年**萨达姆**统治下的**伊拉克**背景下被重新提出，当时**乔治·W·布什**政府中的许多人推动以“可憎债务”为由否认**萨达姆**的债务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: that the dictator was going to steal the money. So, it was a pretty narrow category. It was resurrected in 2003 in the context of Saddam's Iraq and there was a push there by among others many in the George W. Bush administration who wished to have Saddam's debts disavowed on the basis that they were odious.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 我当时的看法是，那是不明智的。因为“可憎债务”的理论过于模糊，国际社会无法认可，因为一旦你走上这条路，就会有很多可疑的角色，他们的债务你可能也想否认。所以我当时的看法是，**伊拉克**将能够在不打出“可憎债务”旗号的情况下实现非常显著的债务减免。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: My view at the time was that that was ill- advised. That the doctrine of odius debt is sufficiently gauzy that it is not something that the international community could have endorsed because once you start down that road there are a lot of sketchy characters out there whose debt you might want to disavow. So my view at that time was that Iraq would be able to achieve very significant debt relief without unfurling the banner of odious debt.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你能再详细解释一下你认为“可憎债务”概念的负面后果吗？因为我认为很多人可能只是出于情感，觉得“是的，我们应该开始使用这个原则。**萨达姆**很坏，借钱给他的人可能也有理由认为他是个坏人。”你认为将这个概念引入主权债务法或规范的代价是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can you explain a little bit more what you see as the negative consequences of this notion of odious debt? Because I think a lot of people just maybe their heartstrings they're like yes we should start using this principle. Saddam bad the lenders to him probably had a reason to think he was a bad guy. What do you see as the cost of introducing this concept into sort of sovereign debt law or norms?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的，Joe，我完全理解这种情感上的论点。它让大多数人觉得是可憎的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah, Joe, I entirely understand the emotional argument. It strikes most people as reprehensible.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 你可能有一个独裁的、盗窃成性的政权，以**罗里塔尼亚共和国**的名义签署合同。当那个混蛋下台后，**罗里塔尼亚**的穷人却不得不偿还那笔债务。这是情感上的论点。另一方面是，什么构成“可憎债务”？你可能有一个可憎的政权，借钱建造一家儿童癌症医院。另一方面，你可能有一个民主选举的政权，借钱资助一个恐怖组织。在**伊拉克**的情况下，**布什**团队真的会将其定义为任何由可憎政权产生的债务。好的，即使你接受这个定义，告诉我什么是一个可憎政权？是一个对邻国发动战争的政权吗？是的，可能。是一个对环境因素不够重视的政权吗？是一个贬低女性的政权吗？告诉我什么是可憎的。一旦你走上这条路，就很难找到一个能让所有人满意地被视为“正直”的政权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: That you could have a dictatorial kleptomaniacal regime that signs a contract on behalf of the Republic of Roritania. And when that son of a bachelor exits the stage, the poor people of Ruran, you've got to repay that debt. That's the emotional argument. The other side of it is what constitutes an odious debt. You can have an odious regime that borrows money to build a children's cancer hospital. On the other hand, you can have a democratically elected regime that borrows money to finance a terrorist organization. What happened in the Iraq situation was the Bush team really would have defined it as any debt incurred by an odious regime. Okay, even if you take that, tell me what is an odious regime? Is it one that makes war on its neighbors? Yes, probably. Is it one that is insufficiently attuned to environmental factors? Is it one that misprices women? Tell me what's odious. And once you start down that road, pretty hard to find a regime that would to everyone's satisfaction be regarded as virtuous.

</details>

### 伊拉克债务重组的经验与委内瑞拉的异同

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈谈**伊拉克**的重组，因为这似乎是人们在讨论**委内瑞拉**时经常拿来比较的上一次主权债务重组。所以，你有一个石油生产国，正如我们一直在讨论的，在一个威权政权下运作，说得委婉一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: talk a little bit more about the Iraq restructuring because this seems to be the previous sovereign debt restructuring that people are drawing a lot of parallels to uh with Venezuela. So you have an oil producing country operating as we've been discussing under an authoritarian regime to put it mildly

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 一个所谓的毒品恐怖分子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: an alleged narotist.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。好吧。**萨达姆·侯赛因**从来不是毒品恐怖分子，是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Okay. Well, Saddam Hussein was never a naroterrorist, was he?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我不知道。他可能……我不知道。我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I don't know. He pro I don't know. I don't

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我不记得了。我当时才11岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I don't remember. I was only like I was like 11.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 毒品恐怖主义可能是**萨达姆**没有犯下的少数罪行之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Naroterrorism is probably one of the few sins that Saddam did not commit.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。是的。好的。这是他有利的一点。谈谈这里的相似之处。我们可以看看**伊拉克**主权债务重组，我认为最终债权人只得到了每美元10美分左右。这是这里的指导方针吗？你认为**委内瑞拉**会走类似的道路吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. A point in his favor. Talk about the parallels here. Can we look at the Iraq sovereign debt restructuring, which I think ended up being something like 10 cents on the dollar for creditors. Is that the guiding light here? Would you expect Venezuela to follow a similar path?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 不，不。**伊拉克**之所以不同寻常，原因如下。你们还记得**乔治·W·布什**，也就是**小布什**，组建了一个由40多个国家组成的联盟。**萨达姆**在全面入侵该国后被推翻。所以该国由联盟临时权力机构管理，主要由**美国**领导，但**英国**和其他一些国家也在那里。他们确实管理着这个国家，而不是像**Donald Trump**所说的那样管理**委内瑞拉**。当时，联盟临时权力机构确实在管理它。**布什**团队非常希望那个实验能够成功。他们希望在**中东**中心地带建立一个稳定、民主的**伊拉克**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: No. No. Iraq was unusual for this reason. You remember that George W. Bush, George II, put together a coalition of 40some countries. Saddam was ousted after a full invasion of the country. So the country was run by the coalition provisional authority largely led by the United States but the Brits were there and there were some others. They really did run the country not in the way Donald Trump says he runs Venezuela at that point. The coalition provisional authority really did run it. The Bush team really wanted that experiment to succeed. They wanted a stable, democratic Iraq right in the middle of the Middle East.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 一个在必要时会支持**以色列**的国家。他们想要一个对抗**伊朗**的堡垒。他们真的希望它成功。他们当时（也就是2003-2004年）的看法是，**萨达姆**积累的这团债务阴云，顺便说一句，他在1990年**安理会**对他实施制裁时就停止支付了，这笔债务存量将有效地阻止任何人投资**伊拉克**、借钱给它等等。因此，**布什**政府的人认为这是**伊拉克**经济复苏的主要障碍，所以他们发布了指令，以最迅速的方式处理这笔债务存量。就他们而言，他们更倾向于Joe的观点，即他们不喜欢**萨达姆·侯赛因**，也不喜欢任何借钱给**萨达姆·侯赛因**的人。所以他们对债权人几乎没有同情。**美国**的风险敞口非常有限。所以这对**美国政府**来说是一个相对无害的立场。但他们最初的提议是直接说这笔债务是可憎的。让我们完全勾销它。我们去了**巴黎俱乐部**，那个谈判政府间债务的团体，我想是带着勾销95%债务的提议。最终，80%的债务被勾销了。这对于一个拥有世界第四大石油储量的中等收入国家来说，绝对是不同寻常的。但这就是**布什**政府的思维方式。我看不出**Donald Trump**对**委内瑞拉**公民有任何特别的关怀。他的关怀似乎是针对石油公司，也许还有**美国政府**本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Someone that would support Israel when that became necessary. They wanted a bull work against Iran. And they really wanted it to succeed. And their perception at the time, this is now 20034, was that this myasmic cloud of debt that Saddam had accumulated and ceased paying, by the way, in 1990 when the Security Council put sanctions on him, that debt stock would effectively keep anyone from investing in Iraq, lending it money, and so forth. So it was viewed by the Bush people as a major obstacle to the economic recovery of Iraq and and so they issued the mandate deal with that debt stock in the most expeditious way possible. And as far as they were more of Joe's view that they didn't like Saddam Hussein and they didn't like anyone who lent money to Saddam Hussein. So they had little sympathy for the creditors. The United States had a very limited exposure. So this was a relatively harmless position for the US government to take. But their initial proposal was to go and and say the debt is odious. Let's write off 100% of it. And we went to the Paris Club, the group that negotiates governmental intergovernmental debt, I think with a proposal to write off 95% of it. In the end, 80% of it was written off. And that was absolutely extraordinary for a middle inome country that sits on the fourth largest oil reserves in the world. But that was the mindset of the Bush people. I don't see Donald Trump having any particular solicitude for the citizens of Venezuela. His solicitude seems to be for the oil companies and perhaps for the US government itself.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这很有趣。我的意思是，我们有什么资格去猜测**Donald Trump**的想法呢？因为另一方面，你知道，石油价格是每桶57美元。石油公司愿意花费数百亿美元重建这个国家吗？他们现在想要更便宜的石油吗？如果**委内瑞拉**的油田重新开启，这很可能会发生。不清楚。撇开所有这些不谈，也许我们稍后会更多地尝试解读**Donald Trump**的想法。我们对**委内瑞拉**债务或**PDVSA**债务的持有者了解多少？我们能分辨出目前持有这些债务的是哪种类型的机构或实体吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's interesting. I mean, who are we, I suppose, to speculate into Donald Trump's mind? Because on the other hand, you know, it's like oil's at $57 a barrel. Do the oil companies want to spend tens of billions of dollars rebuilding this? Do they want even cheaper oil right now, which would presumably happen if the taps turn on in Venezuela? Unclear. Setting all that aside, and maybe we'll get a little bit more towards Donald Trump mind reading in a moment. What do we know about the holders of Venezuelan debt or pedesa debt, are we able to tell what type of institutions or entities are currently holding it?

</details>

### 委内瑞拉债务持有者与谈判动态

**Lee Bukhite**: Joe，终端上有一个名为HDS的功能，代表“持仓”，你可以查一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Joe, there's a function on the terminal called HDS, which stands for holdings, and you can look it up.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。好吧，但我会把它留给Lee。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay. Well, but I'll leave it to leave.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，Lee是终端。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, Lever is the terminal.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 不，不。它主要被交易到**对冲基金**手中。好的。在2019年1月，**布什**先生在他的第一个任期内实施了一项限制，阻止**美国**居民购买**委内瑞拉**债务，甚至不能自己出售。他们可以卖到海外。因此，其中一些被出售了。但正如Tracy在她的开场白中所说，那些日子里，这些债务以每美元7、8、9美分的价格交易。但与大多数主权债务重组一样，当债务以债券形式存在，即自由交易的债券时，你实际上不知道谁拥有它，直到你提出重组要约。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: No, no. It's mostly traded into the hands of hedge funds. Okay. In January of 2019, Mr. Bush in his first term imposed a restriction that prevented US residents from buying Venezuelan debt or even selling it to themselves. They could sell it overseas. And so some of it was sold off. But as Tracy said in her introductory remarks, in those days this debt was trading 7 8 9 cents on the dollar. But as with most sovereign debt restructurings, when the debt is in the form of bonds, freely tradable bonds, you don't actually know who owns it until such time as you make an offer to restructure it.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 只是快速跟进一下，这重要吗？好吧，也许人们对那些以每美元两美分或五美分的价格购买不良债务的**对冲基金**没有太多同情。或者也许人们对某些实体有不同的看法，比如那些保守地管理主权债务以供“寡妇和孤儿”使用的实体。但从国际法、**纽约法**或主权债务重组法的角度来看，债权人群体的构成是否会影响到这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Just real quickly as a followup, does it matter? Okay, maybe people don't have a lot of sympathy for hedge funds that are picking up distress debt at two cents or 5 cents on the dollar or maybe people feel differently about some entity that I don't know is man just conservatively managing sovereign debt for widows and orphans so to speak. But from the perspective of international law or New York law or sovereign debt restructuring law, does the composition of the creditor group bear into this at all?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 不。债权就是债权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: No. The claim is the claim.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: Joe，它在债务谈判中是相关的。如果我面对一个以10美分购买债权的人，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Where it is relevant, Joe, is in the negotiation of the debt. If I sit across from someone who paid 10 cents for their claim, Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我给他20美分，我就是英雄。但如果我面对一个以前的银行家，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and I offer them 20 cents, I'm a hero. But if I sit across from a in the old days a banker

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 他借出了100美分，我给他20美分。我就是个坏蛋。所以它在这个意义上影响着谈判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: who lent a hundred cents and I offer him 20 cents. I'm a heel. And so it plays into the negotiation in that sense.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你认为**美国财政部**会大量参与这些谈判吗？就实际过程、法律过程而言？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Would you expect the US Treasury to be heavily involved in these negotiations just in terms of the actual process, the legal process?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 远不及**乔治·布什**的财政部在2004年和2005年那样。自1982年**墨西哥**开启现代主权债务重组时代以来，**美国财政部**一直关注这些问题以协商一致的方式解决。因此，我预计，如果时机成熟，他们会鼓励**委内瑞拉**政府和**委内瑞拉**债务持有者以协商一致的方式进行谈判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Not nearly as much as George Bush's Treasury was back in 2004 and five. The US Treasury has always had an interest since 1982 when Mexico began the modern era of sovereign debt workouts. US Treasury has always had an interest in seeing these problems dealt with in a consensual negotiated way. So I would expect if and when the time comes they would encourage both the Venezuelan administration and the holders of Venezuela's debts to negotiate them in a consensual way.

### 制裁对重组的阻碍与特朗普政府的立场

**Joe Weisenthal**: 实际上，让我倒退一下。我的意思是，我们正在谈论这些谈判，市场显然反映出一些变化的预期，但是**马杜罗**的逮捕和引渡是否会使这一切不可避免？这是否必须发生？或者是否可能，因为他的副总统目前...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, actually, let me back up. I mean, we're talking about these negotiations and the market is clearly reflecting some expectations of a change, but does the arrest, the rendition of um Maduro make that inevitable? Does this have to happen or is it possible that again because his vice president is currently

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 这是同一个政权。这是同一个政权，**特朗普**似乎对此没意见，因为无论出于何种原因，我们只能猜测他们私下进行了什么样的对话等等。但是这些谈判是否不可避免？是否有正式的发令枪？是否有理由它们必须发生？或者**委内瑞拉**能否一直违约，并在没有解决债务问题的情况下勉强度日？我不认为他们可以无限期地违约，但没有发令枪。事实上，自2017年以来阻止**委内瑞拉**债务重组的，一直是**美国政府**实施的制裁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: It's the same regime. It's the same regime, which seems to be Trump seems to be okay with because for whatever reason, uh, we can only speculate what kind of conversations they've had in the background and so forth. But is there an inevitability to these negotiations? Is there a formal starting gun? Is there a reason that they ever have to happen? Or could Venezuela just stay on default and sort of muddle through without any resolution to the debt question? I don't think they can stay in default indefinitely, but there is no starting gun. As a matter of fact, what has prevented a restructuring of Venezuela's debt since 2017 has been the sanctions imposed by the US government.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，是的。这很有趣。所以，你甚至不能坐下来开始谈论重组，因为你会违反制裁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, yeah. This is funny. So, you can't even sit down and begin to talk about a restructuring because you'd be in violation of of sanctions.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的。所以，这些制裁必须放松。而这个决定最终取决于**特朗普**先生，他可能会或可能不会决定**马杜罗**的下台是开始放松制裁的充分依据，但我认为不会。按照目前的路径，他会希望在**加拉加斯**看到一个顺从的政权。他已经说得很清楚了。**委内瑞拉**总统必须是一个听从**Donald John Trump**命令的人。他已经说过，如果他们足够顺从，那么他可能会开始放松制裁，也许会允许债务重组继续进行。这次改变的是什么，以及这次会有什么不同，如果你听总统上周末的讲话，他没有谈论民主。他只是顺带提了一句希望看到**委内瑞拉**再次伟大。但他的主要焦点是石油公司。他希望他们开采石油，为此，他实际上说：“我们将确保你们在**查韦斯**时代发生的征用索赔得到支付。”如果他信守他在**乔治·布什**在**伊拉克**时所说的话，**Donald Trump**曾批评**布什**没有拿**伊拉克**的石油来支付入侵的费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah. And so, those sanctions would have to be relaxed. And that decision ultimately sits with Mr. Trump and he may or may not decide that the removal of Maduro is a sufficient basis on which to begin relaxing sanctions, but I don't think so. On the current path, he will want to see a complacent regime in Caracus. He has said as much. the president of Venezuela has got to be someone who follows the orders of Donald John Trump. And he's he's said that if they are sufficiently complacent, then perhaps he will begin relaxing sanctions, perhaps allowing a debt restructuring to go forward. What has changed and what will be different this time is if you listen to the president's speech last weekend, he didn't talk about democracy. He made a passing reference to wanting to see Venezuela made great again. But his principal focus was on the oil companies. He wants them pumping oil and to that end in effect said, "We will make sure that your claims for expropriation which occurred in the Chavez era are getting paid." And if he is true to what he said back when George Bush was in Iraq, Donald Trump criticized Bush for not having taken Iraqi oil to pay for the costs of the invasion.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 所以我预计他这次会说，**山姆大叔**有权获得补偿，以支付维持**加勒比海**海军舰队的费用。因此，在重组中，通常是国家公民与国家债权人之间的争吵的“偿付顺序”，在这种情况下，可能有人排在最前面，也许**美国政府**排在最前面，然后是石油公司，之后才是公民和债权人之间的争吵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: And so I expect he will say this time that Uncle Sam is entitled to be recompensed for the cost of keeping that naval armada in the Caribbean. So in a restructuring the waterfall which is normally a squabble between the citizens of the country and the creditors of the country. In this case there may be people at the top and maybe US government is at the very top and oil companies come next and then the squabble between citizens and creditors.

</details>

### 创新解决方案：石油挂钩工具

**Tracy Alloway**: 我在我的生活和工作中了解到一件事，那就是律师如果不是富有创造力，那就什么也不是。所以，我想知道，是否有某种创造性的解决方案，至少可以在一定程度上帮助**委内瑞拉**减轻债务负担，同时，我想，保持投资者的善意。所以，我在想，也许他们可以得到延期而不是削减。或者，也许你可以像**墨西哥**那样，有新的贷款，但这些贷款与旧债务的处理方式不同。诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: One thing I've learned in my life and job is that lawyers are nothing if not creative. So, I'm wondering, is there some sort of creative solution that could at least help perhaps on the margin the Venezuelan debt load while I guess preserving the goodwill, so to speak, of investors. So, I'm thinking, you know, maybe maybe they get an extension instead of a haircut. Or maybe you have something like the Mexico situation where you have new loans but those fall under different treatment to the older debt. Something like that.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的。听着，有几件事。首先，这个国家的石油基础设施已经严重退化。我认为需要两到五年的大量投资才能使基础设施达到**委内瑞拉**在2016年左右的开采水平，大约每天300万桶。所以，这不会在一夜之间发生，不会有大量的收入涌入。第二点，如果**特朗普**先生信守诺言，这些收入的第一批将流向那些进行投资的石油公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah. Look, a couple of things. First, the oil infrastructure in this country has been badly degraded. It's going to take two to five years, I think, of significant investment to bring that infrastructure up to the point where Venezuela is pumping what it was pumping say back in 2016, maybe 3 million barrels a day. So, this is not going to happen overnight that there's a huge influx of revenues. Second point, if Mr. Trump is true to his word, first dibs on those revenues will go to the oil companies who are making these investments.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 第三，一些资金必须用于改善**委内瑞拉**公民的生活，使其有明显的改善。否则，执政的政权将非常脆弱。所以，你谈论的是几年时间，其中大部分资金将不得不流向其他地方，而不是遗留债券持有人的口袋。因此，我预计债券持有人会要求一种通常被称为“**价值回收工具**”的东西。这是一个95%的外汇收入来自石油商品销售的国家。因此，合乎逻辑的做法是债券持有人会说：“给我们一个与石油市场挂钩的工具。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Third, some money is going to have to be used to have a discernable improvement in the lives of Venezuelan citizens. Otherwise, the regime that's in power will be very fragile. So, you're talking about years in which most of this money is going to have to go places other than into the pockets of legacy bond holders. What I would expect therefore is that the bond holders will ask for what is generically called a value recovery instrument. This is a country that deres 95% of its foreign currency earnings from the sale of a commodity oil. So the logical thing would be for the bond holders to say give us an instrument that is a play on the oil market.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 顺便说一句，这在90年代初的所谓“**布雷迪计划**”期间就做过。当时有石油出口国，如**墨西哥**、**委内瑞拉**、**尼日利亚**，他们通过提供石油认股权证来“甜化”他们的**布雷迪**重组，如果未来油价超过某个行权价，这些认股权证就会支付。**墨西哥**在1990年发行的认股权证，行权价设定在每桶14美元的巨大水平。但我预计这将是**委内瑞拉**重组中的“模糊因素”。你说得对，大多数支付将不得不推迟很长时间，但石油工具很可能会成为组合的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: That was done by the way in the early 90s during the so-called Brady initiative. You had oil exporters, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria, and they sweetened their Brady restructurings by giving oil warrants that would pay off if oil exceeded a certain strike price in the future. Mexico's issued in 1990 had the strike price set at the enormous level of $14 a barrel, but I would expect that that will be the fudge factor in a Venezuelan restructuring. You're right that most payments will have to be deferred for quite a long time, but an oil instrument is likely to be part of the mix.

</details>

### 主权债务的国际法与市政法

**Joe Weisenthal**: 当我们谈论主权债务的国际法时，我们实际谈论的是什么法律？因为我知道他们经常谈论**纽约法**，很多债券实际上是在那里发行或通过那里的银行进行的。所以当你谈论“国际法规定这个那个”时，我们实际谈论的是哪一套法律体系，以及什么法律与**委内瑞拉**债务相关？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: When we're talking about international law with respect to sovereign debt, what law are we actually talking about? Because I know often they talk about New York law where a lot of bonds actually get issued or they go through the banks there, whatever. So when you talk about okay international law says this that or whatever about what corpus of law are we actually talking about here and what law is relevant to the Venezuelan debt.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 是的。债务工具本身将根据某个市政管辖区的法律发行。95%的主权新兴市场主权债务是根据**纽约法**或**英国法**发行的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Yeah. The debt instruments themselves will be issued under the law of a municipal jurisdiction. 95% of sovereign emerging market sovereign debt is issued under the law of either New York or England.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。就**委内瑞拉**而言，全部都是**纽约法**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay. In Venezuela's case, it's all New York law.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Okay.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 当我说国际法时，那不是适用于合同的法律。那实际上是适用于构成国际体系一部分的政府的法律。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: When I say international law, that's not the law applicable to the contract. That's really the law applicable to the governments that form part of the international okay

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 系统。所以就**委内瑞拉**而言，将是**纽约法**。但就这一点而言，我知道长期以来一直有人在讨论建立某种共同框架来处理主权债务重组。在目前这个时间点，这是否现实，还是仍然是空中楼阁的想法？这个想法最早是在2001年12月**阿根廷**违约时提出的，实际上是由**IMF**推动的。他们称之为“**主权债务重组机制**”。他们的理由如下：在公司债务重组中，根据破产法、市政破产法，如果绝大多数债权人同意重组，他们的决定就会约束任何持异议的少数派。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: system. So it will be New York law in the case of Venezuela. But just on this note, I know there's been chatter for a long time now about creating some sort of common framework when it comes to sovereign debt restructurings. Is that at all realistic at this point in time or is it still sort of pie in the sky thinking? That idea was first broached back at the time of the Argentine default in December of 2001 and it was actually promoted by the IMF. They called it the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism. They reasoned as follows. In corporate debt workouts, under bankruptcy, municipal bankruptcy laws, if a super majority of the creditors agree to a restructuring, their decision binds any dissenting minority.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Right?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 主权国家不受破产法的约束。因此，主权债务重组的特点是存在“钉子户”债权人。也就是说，那些不加入自愿债务重组并寻求追究其法律补救措施的债权人。**阿根廷**对此深有体会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Sovereigns are not subject to a bankruptcy law. And so, sovereign debt workouts have been characterized by holdout creditors. that is creditors that do not join a voluntary debt restructuring and seek to pursue their legal remedies. Argentina knows all about this.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，他们知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yes, they do.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 所以**IMF**认为，我们需要的是一个针对主权国家的**破产法第11章**。这个想法因为**美国**不支持而胎死腹中。但它仍然有一些生命力，过去几年**纽约州立法机构**也曾提出过法案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: So, the IMF reasoned, well, what we need is a chapter 11 for sovereigns. That idea died a political death because the Americans did not support it. But it continues to have some vitality and bills have been introduced over the last few years into the New York legislature.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 其中一项建议是，也许**纽约**，其法律管辖着许多这些债务工具，应该自行建立一种**破产法第11章**程序。它没有获得太多关注。我不认为那会...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: One of them suggesting that perhaps New York, whose law governs many of these dead instruments, should itself put in place a kind of chapter 11 process. It hasn't gotten much traction. I don't think that that will

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 为什么不呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: why not?

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 有很多原因。主权债务重组的某些方面与公司债务重组有实质性区别。其中之一是，法院无法控制外国主权国家。不能...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Uh for a bunch of reasons. There are aspects of sovereign debt workouts that differ materially from corporate debt workouts. Among other things, the court does not control the foreign sovereign. Cannot

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 外国主权国家。我们要清算你。我们要拿走**委内瑞拉**的钥匙。我的意思是，钥匙某种程度上正在这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: foreign sovereign. We're going to liquidate you. We're going to take the keys to Well, I mean, keys to Venezuela kind of doing it.

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 没错。他们不能说我们要更换管理层。主权国家是主权的。这始终是主权债务重组的主要特点，即你正在与不受任何制度化破产制度约束的债务人打交道。因此，我们不得不依赖协商一致的重组。但我不会对“协商一致”这个词过于强调。有时会有鼓励。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Exactly. They can't say we're going to replace the management. Sovereigns are sovereign. And that has always been the principal feature of sovereign debt workouts is that you're dealing with debtors who are not subject to any institutionalized bankruptcy regime. Therefore, we've had to rely on consensual workouts. But I'm not going to put too fine a point on the word consensual. Sometimes there's been encouragement.

</details>

</details>

**Lee Bukhite**: 再见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lee Bukhite**: Byebye.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: Joe，我真的很喜欢这次对话。Lee有令人难以置信的天赋，能用非常非常清晰的语言解释事物。但是，你知道，让我印象深刻的是，我想，主权债务和公司债务之间的对比。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Joe, I really enjoyed that conversation. Lee has an incredible talent for explaining things in very very clear language. But, you know, the thing that stuck out to me is, I guess, the contrast between sovereign versus corporate debt.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你知道，他最后谈到了这一点。这种观点认为，你不能像处理公司那样对主权国家进行某种标准化的破产程序，因为主权国家是主权的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know, he talked about it at the end. this idea that you can't really have a sort of standardized bankruptcy process for a sovereign as you do with a corporate because sovereigns are sovereign.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你不能有新的股权。就像“哦，现在这个国家归股权持有人所有”，对吧？因为公司就是这样。所以就像“哦，所有的，你知道吗，哦，债务人得到削减，然后他们变成新的股权持有人”，对吧？债务人变成什么？在主权概念中，债务人成为股权持有人意味着什么？除了在某种程度上，他的观点我觉得很有趣，就是“好吧，你可以有一个石油挂钩的工具”，但并不是每个陷入困境的国家都会有一个像石油这样容易出售的商品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You can't have like a new equity. It's like oh and now the and now the country goes to the equity holders, right? Because that's what happens in a company, right? So it's like oh all the you know what oh the debtors get a haircut and there's a new they become equity holders, right? the debtors be what what would that even mean in the sovereign concept for the debtors to become equity holders except to some extent to his point which I thought was interesting was like okay you could have an oil linked instrument but not every country that gets into trouble is going to have like a very easily salailable commodity such as oil

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，而且我也在开场白中提到了这一点，但“债务是一种人类的建构”，它实际上并不存在，除了在我们的思想中。所以...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: yeah and also just I talked about this in the intro but the idea of debt is a human construct like it doesn't actually exist except in our minds And so

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 还有终端的页面上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and on the pages of the terminal

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当然，还有终端的页面上。所以它会随着时间而改变，其中嵌入了所有这些价值观，一个人的合法政权是另一个人的，或者另一个投资者的独裁政权，这似乎很难在公开法庭上进行诉讼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and on the pages of the terminal of course. So it can change over time and there are all these values embedded in it and one man's legitimate regime is another man's or another investor's dictatorship and it seems very hard to litigate that in a public court.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 完全正确。你如何定义“可憎”？你如何定义一个“可憎政权”？你如何定义什么是“适当的收益”和“不适当的收益”？显然极其困难，当然，也许**美国政府**现在会说**马杜罗**是毒品恐怖分子等等，但这只是司法部的观点，司法部已经对**马杜罗**提出了指控，无论那是否是某种客观现实，这很难说。顺便说一句，我喜欢那一集。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Totally. How you define odius how do you define an odious regime? How do you define what are appropriate proceeds and inappropriate proceeds? clearly extremely difficult and of course sure maybe the US government right now will say Maduro narot terrorists etc but that is just the perspective of the department of justice which has uh which has filed charges against Maduro whatever whether that's some objective reality difficult by the way I love that episode

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我宁愿不问任何问题，只是听Lee讲一整集。

**Tracy Alloway**: I would have rather not asked any questions and just listen to Lee talk for the for the whole time

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，也许我们应该做一个关于主权债务的三部曲系列，就让他来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, maybe we should do like a three-part series on sovereign debt and it just be

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: just have Lee tell stories about, you know, being across the table from various creditors.
