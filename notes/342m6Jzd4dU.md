### 委内瑞拉事件

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是1月5日，星期二。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, January 5th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

[Music]

**Tracy Mumford**: 美国对委内瑞拉的袭击及其对 **尼古拉斯·马杜罗** 的抓捕事件持续引发轩然大波，昨日的四个关键时刻对此事进行了展现。首先，在 **联合国安全理事会** 的紧急会议上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The continuing uproar over the US's attack on Venezuela and its capture of Nicholas Maduro played out in four key moments yesterday. First, at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.

</details>

**引用**: 这是西半球。这是我们生活的地方。我们不会允许西半球被用作我们国家敌人的行动基地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we're not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be used as a base of operation for our nation's adversaries.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在会上，美国为其在委内瑞拉的行动进行了辩护，但面临了包括 **巴西**、**墨西哥** 和 **法国** 在内的一些坚定盟友的严厉批评。他们表示，为抓捕马杜罗而采取的军事行动违反了国际法。一位法国高级外交官称，美国已经侵蚀了“国际秩序的基石”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And there the US defended its actions in Venezuela, but faced a wave of criticism from some of its staunch allies, including Brazil, Mexico, and France. They said the military operation to seize Maduro was a violation of international law. And a top French diplomat said the US had chipped away at the very foundation of international order.

</details>

### 国内反应

**Tracy Mumford**: 接下来，在委内瑞拉，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next, in Venezuela,

</details>

[Applause]

**Tracy Mumford**: 该国国民议会举行了一场激烈的会议，包括马杜罗的儿子在内的议员们呼吁释放他。**德利·罗德里格斯**，该国的临时总统，抨击了她所谓的“非法军事侵略”，并对美国采取了敌对态度，尽管她此前曾呼吁和平共存。会议上这种对抗的基调凸显了一个事实：即使马杜罗被美国拘留，他的忠诚追随者在委内瑞拉仍牢牢掌握着权力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: there was a fiery meeting of the country's National Assembly where lawmakers, including Maduro's son, called for his release, and Deli Rodriguez, the interim president of the country, blasted what she called an illegitimate military aggression, taking a hostile tone toward the US, even as she has called for peaceful coexistence. The defiant tone of the meeting underscored the fact that even with Maduro in detention in the US, his loyalists still have a tight grip on power in Venezuela.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 随后，几乎在同一时间，在 **曼哈顿** 的一间法院，马杜罗本人首次出庭接受法官审理，他对自己被指控的“毒品交易”和其他罪名表示不认罪，并声称自己是被美国政府绑架的。他说自己不是普通罪犯，而是战俘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Then at almost exactly the same time in a courthouse in Manhattan, Maduro himself made his first appearance in front of a judge, entering a plea of not guilty to narotism and other charges and saying that he had been kidnapped by the American government. He said he was not a common criminal defendant, but a prisoner of war.

</details>

**引用**: 在法院外，人群聚集，他们高呼“不要为石油流血”、“把手从委内瑞拉土地上拿开”来抗议美国的行动，同时也庆祝马杜罗被捕。**《纽约时报》** 采访了人群中的一位委内瑞拉异见人士，他表示自己曾遭受马杜罗政权的迫害；还有人表示，他们希望他的下台能为委内瑞拉带来新的开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Outside the courthouse, crowds gathered both to protest the US's actions with chants of no blood for oil, hands off Venezuelan soil, but also to celebrate Maduro's capture. The Times spoke with Venezuelan dissident in the crowd who said they'd been persecuted by the Maduro regime and others who said that they hoped his removal would be a new beginning for Venezuela.

</details>

**引用**: “我明白很多人不同意，因为这看起来很疯狂，但对于我们这些多年来遭受苦难的人来说，我只想告诉你，你永远不知道我们已经生活在这种情况下。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: I understand that uh so many people doesn't agree because it it looks crazy what happened, but for us that been suffering so many years uh I I just tell you you never even know what we already live with this situation.

</details>

[Music]

### 格陵兰争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，在华盛顿，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And lastly, in Washington,

</details>

**引用**: “我们有美军驻扎在该国境外。我们设定了条款和条件。我们对他们所有的石油和商业往来实行了全面禁运。所以，美国说了算。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So, the United States is in charge.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **特朗普** 政府一直坚持其现在控制着委内瑞拉的说法。**史蒂文·米勒**，总统特朗普的高级政策顾问之一，在 **CNN** 上阐述了他们的方针。他很快就遭到了参议员 **伯尼·桑德斯** 的尖锐批评。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The administration has been doubling down on its insistence that it now controls Venezuela. Steven Miller, one of President Trump's top policy adviserss, went on CNN to explain their approach. He was quickly met with sharp criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders.

</details>

**引用**: “米勒先生对帝国主义给出了一个很好的定义。这并非新鲜事。我是说，英国做过，法国做过，美国也做过。我们很强大。我们拥有地球上最强大的军队。我们可以经营任何我们想要的国家。这真的是我们人民想要的美国吗？我不这么认为。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Mr. Miller gave a very good definition of imperialism. And that's not new. I mean, England did it, France did it, the United States has done it. We are powerful. We have the strongest military on Earth. We can run any country we want. Is that really the kind of America that our people want? I don't think so.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 参议院预计本周晚些时候将就一项决议进行投票，该决议将迫使特朗普总统在继续在委内瑞拉进行任何军事行动前获得国会批准。到目前为止，共和党议员大多支持政府，而一些民主党人则质疑抓捕马杜罗的突袭行动是否合法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Senate is expected to hold a vote later this week on a resolution that would force President Trump to get Congress's permission to continue any military operations in Venezuela. So far, Republican lawmakers have largely backed the administration, while some Democrats have questioned whether the raid to capture Maduro was legal.

</details>

[Music]

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于特朗普政府还有两个快速更新。美国应该拥有 **格陵兰** 作为美国的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two more quick updates on the Trump administration. the United States should have Greenland as part of the United States.

</details>

**引用**: 在 **CNN** 的采访中，**史蒂文·米勒** 还宣称，格陵兰理所当然地属于美国，并且如果特朗普政府愿意，可以从 **丹麦**手中夺取它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: In his interview on CNN, Steven Miller also declared that Greenland rightfully belongs to the US and that the Trump administration could seize it from Denmark if it wanted to.

</details>

**引用**: “我们生活在一个真实的世界里，这个世界由力量、由武力、由权力所统治。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: We live in a world in the real world that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这些评论反映了米勒对世界秩序的设想，即美国可以在国家利益允许的情况下推翻其他国家并夺取领土。如果美国真的对格陵兰采取行动，这将从根本上撕裂 **北约**。丹麦和美国都是该军事联盟的创始成员国，该联盟承诺相互防御。丹麦首相昨日表示，特朗普威胁要夺取格陵兰的言论应被认真对待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: the comments reflect Miller's vision for a world order in which the US can overthrow other countries and take territory if the government says it's in the national interest. If the US does act on Greenland, it would essentially rip NATO apart. Denmark and the US are both founding members of the military alliance where countries pledged to defend each other against attack. Denmark's prime minister said yesterday that Trump's threats to seize Greenland should be taken seriously.

### 疫苗政策调整

**Tracy Mumford**: 在卫生部长 **罗伯特·F·肯尼迪** 二世的任内，一项最重大的变动是，**CDC**（美国疾病控制与预防中心）的儿童推荐疫苗名单被大幅缩减。过去，建议儿童接种17种常规疫苗，现在是11种。联邦官员昨日宣布，他们不再建议所有儿童接种甲肝和乙肝、流感或 **RSV**（呼吸道合胞病毒）疫苗，而RSV是导致美国婴儿住院的主要原因。肯尼迪，一位长期的疫苗怀疑论者，表示此举“保护了儿童，尊重了家庭，并重建了公众对公共健康的信任”。更新后的指南预计不会立即影响家庭获得疫苗的途径，但公共卫生专家表示愤怒，称联邦官员没有提供证据支持这些改变，也没有纳入疫苗专家的意见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And in one of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s most significant changes yet, the CDC's list of recommended vaccines for children has been drastically scaled back. There were 17 routine shots recommended for kids. Now there are 11. Federal officials announced yesterday that they no longer suggest all children get immunized against hepatitis A and B, the flu, or RSV, which is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the US. Kennedy, who's been a longtime vaccine skeptic, said the move quote, protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health. The updated guidance isn't expected to immediately affect families access to the shots, but public health experts expressed outrage, saying federal officials did not present evidence to support the changes or incorporate input from vaccine experts.

### 议员辞职

**Tracy Mumford**: “能担任佐治亚州第14选区的代表，我感到荣幸和自豪。” 强硬派共和党人 **玛乔丽·泰勒·格林** 已于昨晚午夜生效辞去职务。她是在去年年底与特朗普总统公开决裂后突然宣布辞职的。两人曾是亲密盟友，但在过去一年中反复发生冲突，最引人注目的是她推动释放 **爱泼斯坦（Epstein）** 文件。特朗普给她起了个绰号“Marjgery Trader Green”。在她离开华盛顿之际，她发誓已厌倦政治。我的同事 **罗伯特·德雷珀** 说，她在国会的遗产并非立法成就，而是关于她如何利用政治聚光灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Been an honor and a privilege to serve Georgia's 14th district as their representative. Effective midnight last night, the hard-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Green has resigned from office. She abruptly announced that she was leaving late last year after publicly breaking with President Trump. The two went from close allies to repeatedly clashing over the last year, most notably over her push to get the Epstein files released. Trump branded her Marjgery Trader Green. as she leaves Washington swearing that she's done with politics. My colleague Robert Draper says her legacy in Congress isn't a legislative one. It's not about any bills she championed. It's about how she used the political spotlight.

</details>

**引用**: “我所做的就是敲响警钟。这是美国的一场重大危机。她比她之前的几乎任何一位立法者都更清楚，在国会里，全世界都是一个舞台，你可以吸引人们的注意力。你可以增加自己的观众。你可以通过在镜头前做出离谱的事情来积累在线捐款。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: What I am doing is sounding the alarm bells. This is a major crisis in America. She really more than almost any legislator before her understood that in Congress all the world's a stage and that you could seize people's attention. You could increase your own audience. You could amass online donations by doing outrageous things on camera.

</details>

**引用**: “你的感受受伤了吗？” 她的言论在委员会听证会以及国情咨文演讲中都引起了关注，2022年她曾对拜登总统大喊大叫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Are your feelings hurt? her words down a both in committee hearings and for that matter at the State of the Union address where in 2022 she famously heckled President Biden.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我与格林进行了长时间的谈话，简而言之，她离开国会的理由分为两类。第一，国会比过去更加成为一个“无所作为”的政府分支。第二，因为她觉得她的党派领袖特朗普总统已经偏离了最初吸引她进入国会的“美国优先”原则。我认为，这其中也表明 **MAGA** 运动中正在缓慢但确实地出现真正的分裂，少数（不是很多，但少数）该运动的领导者正在质疑其“教父”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: I spoke to Green at length and in a nutshell her reason for leaving Congress broke down into two categories. First, that Congress had become even more of a do nothing branch of government than it had in the past. And secondly, because she felt that the leader of her party, President Trump, had strayed from the America first principles that brought her to Congress to begin with. I think that among other things, it shows that there is a real fracture developing slowly but surely in the MAGA movement where a few, not many, but a few leaders of that movement are calling into question its godfather.

### 历史的回响

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，**伊娃·施洛**，一位 **犹太** 大屠杀幸存者，也是 **安妮·弗兰克** 的继姐，于96岁高龄去世。成长过程中，她的家人为躲避纳粹而逃离维也纳，然后是布鲁塞尔，最终抵达阿姆斯特丹，在那里他们与弗兰克一家成了邻居。当伊娃和安妮都还是十几岁的少年时，她们的家庭都躲藏了起来。安妮在她的日记中详细记录了那段时光。在躲藏了大约两年后，两家人都被盖世太保发现。安妮死于 **贝尔根-贝尔森** 集中营。伊娃后来从 **奥斯维辛** 获释。安妮的父亲，作为弗兰克家族唯一的幸存者，后来娶了伊娃的母亲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, Eva Schllo, a Holocaust survivor and the stepsister of Anne Frank, has died at 96. Growing up, her family fled Vienna, then Brussels, ahead of the Nazis, before they landed in Amsterdam, where they became neighbors with the Franks. When both Eva and Anne were barely teenagers, their families went into hiding. Anne famously detailed that time in her diary. After roughly two years of staying hidden away, both families were discovered by the Gustapo. Anne died at the Bergen Bellson concentration camp. Eva was later freed from Awitz. And Anne's father, who was the only surviving member of the Frank family, went on to marry Eva's mother.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 40多年来，伊娃一直没有谈论过她在战争期间所遭受的恐怖。当她的孙辈问起她胳膊上的纹身时，她告诉他们那是一个电话号码。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: For more than 40 years, Eva didn't talk about the horrors that she'd endured during the war. When her grandkids asked her about the tattoo on her arm, she told them it was a phone number.

</details>

**引用**: “我是一个非常害羞的人，从不谈论我的经历，突然有200个人看着我。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: I was a very shy person, never spoken about my experience, and suddenly there were 200 people looking at me.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 但在20世纪80年代关于安妮生平的一个展览开幕式上，伊娃开始公开讲述自己的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: But at the opening of an exhibit about Ann's life in the 1980s, Eva began to tell her own story publicly.

</details>

**引用**: “然后，洪水闸门最终打开了，我再也停不下来。” 她开始周游世界，向人们讲述不公正的危险，特别是对年轻人。2019年，当她听说加州一群学生被拍到行纳粹礼时，她亲自去见了他们，事后她说：“我认为他们真的没有考虑后果，但我认为他们从中吸取了终生教训。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Then eventually the floodgates opened and I couldn't stop anymore. She went on to travel all across the world to speak about the dangers of injustice, particularly to young people. In 2019, when she heard about a group of students in California who'd been photographed giving a Nazi salute, she went to meet with them personally, saying afterwards, "I think they really didn't think about the consequences, but I think they have learned a lesson for life."
