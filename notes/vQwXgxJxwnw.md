### 移民背景与早期生活

**Chamath**: **CZ**，欢迎来到 All-In 播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: CZ, welcome to the All-In podcast.

</details>

**CZ**: 谢谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Well, thanks for having me here.

</details>

**Chamath**: 见到你真的非常高兴。我想从头开始聊起，因为我觉得很多人并不像他们应该的那样了解你的背景。我非常关注的一部分是你早期在**加拿大**的经历，这和我的很像。你在**麦当劳**打过工，我在**汉堡王**打过工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: It's really, really great to see you. I want to go all the way back to the beginning because I think a lot of people don't really know your background the way that they probably should. The part of the background that I really care about is there's parts of your early journey in Canada, which is very similar to mine. You worked at McDonald's. I worked at Burger King.

</details>

**CZ**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Okay.

</details>

**Chamath**: 但在那之前，你的父母在**天安门事件**前后从中国移民出来，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: But before that, your parents were able to immigrate from China right around Tiananmen Square, right?

</details>

**CZ**: 我父亲是在 1984 年去加拿大留学的，那是 1989 年之前的五年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: My father went to Canada to study in 1984. That's five years before Tiananmen Square.

</details>

**Chamath**: 那是怎么发生的？你父亲去了加拿大之后就留在那里了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: How did that come about? So your father stayed in Canada once he went there or no?

</details>

**CZ**: 他基本上每年能回来探亲两次，但大部分时间他都在加拿大。他在中国曾是一名**教授**。他先是在**多伦多大学**参加了一个交流项目，几年后搬到了温哥华的**不列颠哥伦比亚大学 (UBC)**。那时申请护照非常困难，需要三四年的时间。我们从 1985 年左右开始申请，花了大约两三年才拿到护照，拿到护照后又花了几年才拿到签证。当时的流程就是这么慢。最终我们在 1989 年事件后不久拿到了签证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Uh he he could visit us every twice a year basically but he would most of the time he was in Canada and he was a teacher in China. He was a professor in China and then he went to do a exchange program in University of Toronto first. And then a couple years later he moved to UBC University of British Columbia in Vancouver. And then he was there. We were applying back back then it's actually very difficult to get a passport. It takes like three or four years to get a passport. We started applying in 1985 fiveish. It took like two three years to get a passport and then after you get a passport... meaning a Chinese passport. A Chinese passport. Yeah. So and then it takes like another few years to get a visa. Like that's just how long the process takes back then. And then yeah, so we got it shortly after in 1989.

</details>

**Chamath**: 回过头来看，这似乎有些机缘巧合。有没有可能在事件发生后，他们直接关闭了一切，不再批准签证了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: When you look back, it almost seems fortuitous. Isn't there a version where post-Tiananmen they kind of just shut everything down and say, \"Okay, let's just reset and then maybe they wouldn't have approved the visa or...\"

</details>

**CZ**: 事实上，在那之后签证反而变得更容易了，但护照变得更难办了。他们不再轻易签发新护照。但我们很幸运，在事件发生前一年左右就拿到了护照，当时正在等签证，而之后签证变得容易了。所以从某种程度上说，那件事反而帮我们拿到了签证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: No, actually after that the visa got easier. The passports got harder. So they no longer issue new passport... the reissue of new passports got harder. But we were lucky. So we got the passports maybe a year before that and then we're waiting for the visa and then afterwards the visa got easier. So in some ways that actually kind of helped us to get the visa.

</details>

### 加拿大的成长岁月

**Chamath**: 那件事有没有在某种程度上塑造了你的观点？当时你才 12 岁，是太年轻了还是有影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Did that event shape your perspective in any way shape or form or not really? Were you too young or no? You were what 12?

</details>

**CZ**: 我当时 12 岁。我觉得在意识层面没有，它没有改变我太多。但在潜意识里，当时有很多关于**民主**的讨论。我当时住在大学校园里，那是**中国科学技术大学**，中国最顶尖的四所大学之一。所以大学生之间有很多讨论，他们比我大七到九岁。虽然我才 12 岁，没有真正参与其中，但我认为潜意识里可能产生了一些影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I was 12. So I think consciously no. It didn't change me that much but I subconsciously I think you know there were discussions about democracy. I was actually living on a university campus back then, the China Science and Technology University, one of the top four universities in China. So there were a lot of discussions among the university students which were older, probably seven to nine years older than me. So there were some discussions but I was 12 so I wasn't really clued into it but I think subconsciously it may have some kind of a subconscious impact.

</details>

**Chamath**: 搬到温哥华后感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: And what was it like when you moved to Vancouver?

</details>

**CZ**: 感觉完全不同，是一个全新的国家。我在学校学过几年英语，但一点也不流利。温哥华很棒，加拿大到处是绿植，空间开阔，生活水平很高，一切都很干净，水果都比以前见的大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I moved to Vancouver. Yeah. It's just different. It's very different. It's just a completely new country. I studied English for like couple years in school but you know I was not fluent at all. But yeah, Vancouver is great. Canada is nice green, nice greenery, open space. Everything's pretty, the living standard is high. Everything's pretty good. Everything is very clean. The fruits are bigger. It's just a really nice environment.

</details>

**Chamath**: 当家人团聚后，你父母都工作吗？他们做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Did both your parents work when the family was reunited? What do they do?

</details>

**CZ**: 我父亲当时在大学当助理教授，每个月拿大约 1000 加元的津贴。我们住在 UBC 提供的低价教职工宿舍里。我记得抵达加拿大的第三天，我母亲就去了一家缝纫工厂缝衣服。她在中国曾是数学和历史老师，但因为英语不好，找不到同水平的工作，只能在拿最低工资的工厂干活。她在那儿干了七到十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: So my father was like assistant professor in the university. He gets like a thousand Canadian dollars per month of like a stipend. We get some like really low-cost housing with the faculty housing from UBC. So we lived on campus. I think on the third day of our arrival in Canada, my mom went to a factory, sewing factory to work like sewing clothes. She was a math and history teacher in China, but she doesn't speak that much English. So she couldn't get the same level of jobs and she basically can only work at a minimum wage factory. She did that for like seven to 10 years.

</details>

**Chamath**: 我母亲在斯里兰卡曾是护士，我们移民获得难民身份后，我父亲失业了，我母亲成了管家。我 14 岁时得到了第一份工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: My mom was a nurse in Sri Lanka and when we immigrated when we got refugee status, my father was unemployed and my mom became a housekeeper and that's what she did. And then I think when I was like 14 is when I got my first job.

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，我 15 岁时在麦当劳得到了第一份工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah. I got my first job at McDonald's at I think it's 14 or 15. I think it was 15.

</details>

**Chamath**: 我们同岁，所以可能也是 14 岁。你还记得当时不列颠哥伦比亚省的最低工资是多少吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: We're the same age so it probably would have been 14. Do you remember what the minimum wage was in British Columbia back then?

</details>

**CZ**: 我记得。最低工资是 6 美元，但麦当劳只付 4.5 美元。这低于最低工资，因为麦当劳有特殊豁免，因为那里有很多年轻人工作。我在 14 岁生日那天申请了工作，一周后就开始在那儿翻汉堡了。那是我的第一份收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I do. The minimum wage was $6, but McDonald's pay $4.50. That's below minimum wage because the McDonald's somehow had like a special exemption because they a lot of young kids work there. So, I think it was on my 14th birthday that I applied for the job and then a week later I was flipping burgers there. It was the first income I had.

</details>

### 技术启蒙与大学经历

**Chamath**: 你当时不是那种 24 小时都在编程、学习计算机科学的天才少年吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: You're not like this precocious technical wonder kid who's coding 24/7 and learning computer science or were you?

</details>

**CZ**: 不，我不会那样描述自己。我是个技术男，我学习计算机科学，高中时就对编程感兴趣，但我不是什么编程奇才或天才。我觉得自己是个不错的程序员，职业生涯中写过一些不错的代码。大约在 28 到 30 岁时，我开始转向业务开发和销售。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Uh no I wouldn't describe me as that. I think I'm a technical guy. I started computer science. I was interested in programming even in high school. But I wasn't a programming wizard. I wasn't like one of those really genius coders. I think I'm a decent coder. I wrote some decent code in my career and then when I was like 28, 30-ish I moved away from coding. I was doing more business development, sales and etc.

</details>

**Chamath**: 所以你就是一个努力适应加拿大的普通移民孩子。你朋友多吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So you're a normal immigrant kid learning to adapt in Canada. Did you have a lot of friends?

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，我有很多朋友。在学校里，大多数亚洲人只和亚洲人混在一起，但我是一个例外，我有很多白人朋友和各种各样的朋友。在加拿大的青少年时光非常棒，那是我人生中最美好的几年，塑造了我快乐的性格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah, I had a lot of friends. In our school most of the Asians hang out with Asians but I was actually one of the exceptions that I had like Caucasian friends. I had all kind of different friends. My teenager years in Canada was great. It was like some of the best years, I think those years are really shaped to me to be a happy person.

</details>

**Chamath**: 当你没能进入我的母校**滑铁卢大学**而不得不选择**麦吉尔大学 (McGill)** 时，你感觉如何？这让你觉得自己很笨吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: How did it feel when you weren't able to get into my alma mater University of Waterloo and so had to settle for McGill? How did that make you feel? Does it make you feel stupid?

</details>

**CZ**: 实际上，我姐姐去了滑铁卢，所以我当时在滑铁卢、麦吉尔和多伦多大学之间做选择。我不想留在温哥华去 UBC，我想去不同的城市。UBC 给了我录取通知，但我拒绝了。当时我非常尊敬的一位朋友的母亲建议我当医生，因为医生生活水平高。我听从了她的建议，去学了生物学。但滑铁卢并不是一所以生物学见长的学校，所以我去了麦吉尔。但一个学期后，我就决定不再学物理了，转到了计算机科学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: So actually my sister went to Waterloo so I was deciding between Waterloo and McGill and maybe UT. I knew I wasn't going to go to UBC. I wanted a different city. And actually UBC gave me an offer but I just knew I don't want to go there. At the time my friend's mother who I really respect, she said well you might want to become a doctor because doctors have a good living, a good lifestyle. I took her advice. I study biology and Waterloo is not much of a biology school. So, I went to McGill. But then one semester later I said, \"No, no more biology. I'm going to move to computer science.\"

</details>

**Chamath**: 你的大学生活典型吗？暑假有很棒的实习吗？你是怎么付学费的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Was it a typical kind of college experience for you? Did you have great jobs in the summertime or were you just like an average normal university kid? How'd you pay for school by the way?

</details>

**CZ**: 我每个暑假都工作，学年期间也兼职。我没有申请学生贷款。第一年我从父亲那里拿了大约 6000 加元，第二年还差一点，我姐姐给了我 3000 加元。从那以后，我再也没拿过家里的钱，完全自给自足。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I worked every summer. I worked every summer and I also worked part-time during the school year. I didn't take any student debt. The first year I actually still took about $6,000 Canadian dollars from my dad. The second year I was still a bit short. My sister gave me $3,000. And then from that point on I never took money at all. I was self-sustainable. No student debt. Very lucky.

</details>

### 东京历险与职业起步

**Chamath**: 你从麦吉尔大学计算机科学专业毕业了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So you graduate from McGill in computer science.

</details>

**CZ**: 事实上，我没有从麦吉尔毕业。我在那里读了四年，大三时得到了一份实习工作，然后实习期不断延长，我就没回麦吉尔。后来我发现申请日本的工作签证需要学士学位，于是我在 2000 年互联网泡沫顶峰时，参加了一个名为**美国计算机科学学院**的在线教育项目，拿到了学位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah. In computer... actually I didn't graduate from McGill. I went there for four years and on my third year I got an internship job and then extended, extended, extended and I didn't go back to McGill. So I didn't graduate from McGill and later on I found out I still need a bachelor's degree to apply for work visas in Japan. So I went to an online education program called the American College of Computer Science and got a degree there.

</details>

**Chamath**: 哪份实习让你开始工作的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Okay. So which internship did you get where you started to work there?

</details>

**CZ**: 是在**东京**的一家公司。我从大一开始就一直在做编程工作。我先是在一家叫 Original Sim 的公司写模拟软件，大三时进入了东京的一家公司叫 **Fusion Systems Japan**。他们为东京证券交易所的经纪商开发**订单执行系统**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I got an internship at to in Tokyo. I always from first year college I always worked on a programming job. I worked at a company called Original Sim writing some simulation software and then third year I got into a company in Japan in Tokyo called Fusion Systems Japan and then they were writing order execution systems for brokers of the Tokyo stock.

</details>

**Chamath**: 那是一家在加拿大有办公室的日本公司吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Sorry that's a Japanese company with an office in Montreal or an office in Canada or no?

</details>

**CZ**: 不，我直接去了东京。那其实是一群美国人在东京开的公司。我当时觉得这是一场冒险，在东京生活一个暑假一定很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: No no I I went to Tokyo. It's actually an American bunch of American guys' company that's in Tokyo. I mean I was a college student and living in Tokyo is like you know it's fun. It's a dream.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你当时写的是什么样的软件？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: And what kind of software did you write?

</details>

**CZ**: 主要是订单执行软件。基本上就是今天驱动**币安**运行的那种软件。我参与的所有软件都不涉及决策，只是负责订单的移动和买卖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Mostly order execution software. So the same software like that moves orders and buy... what drives Binance today. Pretty much. So it's the same style. Actually all the software I was involved with have no decision-making.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你是被这个领域吸引，还是仅仅因为它是一份工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Were you attracted to the subject matter or you just did it because it was your job?

</details>

**CZ**: 一开始是因为工作。我当时太年轻，不知道各行各业的区别。公司最初让我负责一个医疗影像存储系统的项目，但很快我就接触到了公司的核心产品——订单执行系统。我喜欢它，因为它需要极高的技术专业性，一切都关乎**效率**、速度和**低延迟**。潜意识里，我是一个效率驱动的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I first did it was because it was my job. I was so young I didn't know what all the different industries are. But very soon the company's main product is the order execution system, so I was involved in that and then that became the thing over my career and I like it because it requires quite a lot of technical expertise. Everything is about efficiency, making it go as fast as possible, process as low latency as possible. I'm an efficiency kind of driven guy.

</details>

### 低延迟交易的技术挑战

**Chamath**: 在高频交易组织中，他们为了节省几毫秒的延迟，甚至会定制电路和物理光纤。在软件层面，你如何针对这些边界条件进行优化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: In high frequency trading organization, they go to such a degree to basically optimize for efficiency and low latency all the way down to their own physical fiber infrastructure. How does that manifest in the software? How do you actually optimize for those boundary conditions in code?

</details>

**CZ**: 有几个层面。首先，你要写出高效的代码，消除所有数据库查询，将一切都放在**内存**中进行。你要减少任何额外的计算，简化风险检查。更高级的版本会使用 **FPGA**（现场可编程逻辑门阵列），这是一种直接在网卡上的芯片，这样数据就不必经过内存再回到处理器。十年前，那个往返过程大约是 100 微秒，通过 FPGA 可以减少到 20 微秒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Well, there's quite a few levels, right? The first level you do is basically you write a software to be efficient and fast. You want to remove all the database lookups. So you want to do everything in memory and then you want to reduce any sort of additional computation. You want to simplify the risk checks. And then the more advanced versions you move on to like the FPGA which is a network chip card that's on the network card. So that you don't have to go all the way up to memory and come all the way back down to the processor. Back then that round trip is about 100 microseconds and by avoiding that you reduce down to 20 microseconds.

</details>

**Chamath**: 既然高频交易涉及这么多资金，为什么他们不尝试开发自己的**定制芯片 (ASIC)**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Why when so much money is on the line for high frequency trading, why did they never try their own custom silicon (ASIC)?

</details>

**CZ**: 我认为是因为算法变化太快了。设计自己的芯片虽然非常高效，但修改起来需要很长时间。FPGA 提供了两全其美的方案，尽管它的编程周期也比软件长十倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I think the algorithms change too often. So when you want to design your own chip, it is very efficient, but when you want to change it, it takes a long time. I think FPGA already offers kind of the best of both worlds.

</details>

### 从彭博到上海创业

**Chamath**: 你在日本工作的公司成功吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: The company you worked at in Japan was it successful?

</details>

**CZ**: 很成功，那家公司在 2000 年之前被一家纳斯达克上市公司以 5200 万美元收购了。当时我才 20 多岁，只是个程序员，一个“薪水族”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: It's successful. That company got sold to a NASDAQ listed company just before 2000 for like $52 million. At that time I was too young. I was like 20 something. I was just a coder. You're a salary man.

</details>

**Chamath**: 之后发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So then walk us through what happens afterwards.

</details>

**CZ**: 公司被收购后出现了严重的文化冲突，这是我第一次意识到并购可能行不通。原来的合伙人又开了一家新公司，租了非常豪华的办公室，但一年后就倒闭了，因为没有任何收入。这让我明白，过去的成功并不能保证未来的成功。2001 年初，我开始找新工作，**彭博 (Bloomberg)** 正在招聘。我在 911 事件前拿到了纽约的录取通知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: So that company got sold. There was a lot of culture clashes. That's my first experience about how mergers may not work. The same partners went to do a different company, but they rented a very fancy office. That company only lasted a year. It means that previous success doesn't guarantee future success. In early 2001 I was looking for new jobs and then Bloomberg was hiring. This is right before 911. I kind of got an offer before 911.

</details>

**Chamath**: 911 之后你还是去了纽约？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So after 911 you went to New York?

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，我在 2001 年 11 月去了纽约。当时的街道非常安静。我在彭博工作了四年，担任高级开发人员，负责期货交易系统。当时我还没有创业的念头，只是一个想体验世界、寻找出路的年轻人。我在两年内被提拔了三次，开始管理一个 60 到 80 人的团队。我不再写代码，变成了经理，那是“最糟糕的转型”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I went to New York in November of 2001. I worked at Bloomberg for four years. I joined as a senior developer. I was put into a team called Tradebook Futures. Still no inkling of that entrepreneurial bug. I was just a young guy trying to get a job, experience different parts of the world. I got promoted three times in two years and then I was leading a team of 60 initially and then grew to about 80 people. That's when I became sort of a manager. I no longer wrote code. The worst transition.

</details>

**Chamath**: 然后你辞职去了中国？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: And then you quit and moved to China.

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，2005 年初。我在日本认识的朋友想在亚洲创办一家新的金融科技公司。他们认为**上海**是未来金融科技最热门的地方。我们六个人去了上海，我是唯一会说中文的，虽然当时我的中文已经很生疏了。我们的想法是把华尔街的交易技术带到中国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yes. Beginning of 2005. The same friends I made in Japan, they were talking about starting a new fintech company in Asia. They said Shanghai is most likely the most happening place for the future of fintech. So the six of us went there to do a new IT startup in Shanghai. Our idea was let's bring the Wall Street trading technology into China so we can service the brokers and exchanges in China.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你们当时知道怎么分配股权吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Did you know to even ask the question like okay guys what's our equity split?

</details>

**CZ**: 并不是平分的。大老板占了大约 40%，剩下的五个人平分，我拿了大约 11%。我当时对股东权利、优先股和普通股一无所知。到了上海后，我开始和客户谈，才发现我们注册为**外商独资企业 (WFOE)**，而中国的券商和金融机构是不允许与外商独资企业合作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: It wasn't one-sixth. The top guy had like 40% and the rest five of us split equally so I had about 11%. I didn't know any of the ins and outs about shareholder rights. I had no idea what common stock is versus preferred. Once we landed in China, I found out we are registered as a wholly foreigner owned enterprise (WFOE). The Chinese brokers and financial institutions are not allowed to work with a WFOE.

</details>

**Chamath**: 所以你们转型了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So you pivoted?

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，我们变成了“外包开发”。我们为各种公司做 IT 系统，甚至修打印机或做 SAP 实施。我们做了几年，活了下来。我们有很多汽车行业的客户，比如上海通用、上海大众。后来我们在香港开了办公室，开始与摩根士丹利、德意志银行合作。我在那家公司待了八年，直到 2013 年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah, the company pivoted towards doing any IT system for any company. Work for hire. We can be fixing printers or we can be writing SAP implementations. We did that for a few years and we actually made a living. We had a number of automotive clients, Shanghai General Motors, Shanghai Volkswagen. Three or four years in we started having offices in Hong Kong and then we were dealing with Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank. I left in 2013 after 8 years.

</details>

### 比特币的启示

**Chamath**: 在那八年里，你结婚生子了。到 2013 年你 36 岁时，你还是个拿薪水的初级合伙人，孩子上私立学校，生活很稳定。然后发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: In the eight years you worked at that company, you got married and had kids. By 2013 you're 36, a salary guy, junior partner, kids in private school. So then what happens?

</details>

**CZ**: 我接触到了**比特币**。我的一位朋友告诉我一定要看看这个东西。我花了大约六个月才完全理解它。我读了**白皮书**，一遍又一遍地读。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I came across Bitcoin. One of my friends tells me, \"Look, CZ, you got to look at this thing called Bitcoin.\" I look into it. It took me about roughly six months to fully understand it. I read the white paper and I read it again and read it again.

</details>

**Chamath**: 我在 2012 年写过一篇关于比特币的文章，说每个人都应该把净资产的 1% 投入比特币作为“混蛋保险”。比特币白皮书最吸引我的一点是，它是极少数我能从头读到尾，且写得极其优雅、非技术人员也能读懂的技术文档。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: I wrote this thing in 2012 about Bitcoin and I said everybody should put 1% of their net worth into Bitcoin as \"schmuck insurance\". The thing that captivated me was it was the only white paper that I read end to end where I thought this is one of the most elegantly written pieces of non-technical prose. You could literally give it to somebody non-technical and they would understand it.

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，它只有九页。写得短小精悍且优雅是非常困难的。向我推荐它的是**曹大容 (Ron Cao)**，他当时是光速创投在中国的董事总经理。我们在玩私人扑克局，他说：“CZ，你应该看看比特币。”第二天我和**李启元 (Bobby Lee)** 吃了午饭，他当时正要加入 BTCC 担任 CEO。Bobby 告诉我，把净资产的 10% 投进去，如果归零你只损失 10%，但如果涨 10 倍，你的净资产就翻倍了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah, and it's only nine pages. It's much harder to write it very short and elegantly. The friend that showed it to you was Ron Cao. He was a managing director of Lightspeed Ventures in China. We have a poker house game. Ron says, \"CZ, you should look at this thing called Bitcoin.\" I had lunch with Bobby Lee the next day and Bobby said put 10% of your net worth into Bitcoin. He said there's a small chance you will go to zero then you lose 10%. There's a much higher chance you will go 10x and you'll double your net worth.

**Chamath**: 你当时觉得入场晚了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Did you feel late?

</details>

**CZ**: 到 2013 年底我完全信服时，比特币已经从 70 美元涨到了 1000 美元。我觉得太晚了。但在比特币行业，无论你什么时候进来，你总会觉得自己晚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: By end of 2013 I started like I'm convinced now. But then Bitcoin went from $70 in mid 2013 to like $1,000 by end of 2013. I was like, I'm too late. Doesn't matter when you get into Bitcoin, you always feel late.

### 卖房梭哈与币安诞生

**Chamath**: 你当时还在那家公司工作，是利用业余时间研究这些吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Were you still working at that company while you were doing all of this moonlighting?

</details>

**CZ**: 是的。我去拉斯维加斯参加了一个比特币会议，见到了 **Vitalik**、查理·李等所有人。当时媒体都在说比特币是毒枭用的，但在会议上我看到的是一群极客和非常好的人。回来后，我告诉合伙人我们要写一个比特币支付系统，但他们不感兴趣。对我来说，互联网我太年轻没赶上，比特币我不能再错过了。于是我决定辞职，卖掉了上海的房子，全部换成比特币。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yes. I flew to Las Vegas for a Bitcoin conference. Met Vitalik, Charlie Lee, everyone. The media was like Bitcoin is only used by drug lords. But when you go to the conference it was like a bunch of geeks and they're very nice people. I told my partners we should do a Bitcoin payment system. For me, the internet I was too young to do too much with it, and there was this Bitcoin thing and I wasn't going to miss it. So I told my partners I'm going to quit. I sold my apartment in Shanghai and buy Bitcoin.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你卖了多少钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: How much did you sell it for?

</details>

**CZ**: 大约 90 万美元。我分批买入，第一批是在 800 美元买的，然后价格跌到了 600、400 美元，最后均价大约 600 美元。当时我还没有工作，但我只想在比特币行业找工作。几周后，我加入了 **Blockchain.info** 担任技术副总裁，后来又去了 **OKCoin** 担任 CTO。但在 OKCoin 待了八个月后，因为文化差异和一些我不认同的做法，我离开了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Roughly $900,000. Every trench I get, I just buy. The first trench at $800 and then Bitcoin is dropping $600, $400. Kind of averaged to about $600. I was looking for a job in the Bitcoin industry. I joined Blockchain.info as VP of Engineering. Then I joined OKCoin as CTO. That didn't last long either because there were culture differences.

</details>

**Chamath**: 币安是怎么开始的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: So how do we get from there to Binance?

</details>

**CZ**: 2015 年，我和几个同事想在东京做一个比特币交易所，但投资者认为我不懂日语，不会成功。他们建议我把技术卖给其他交易所。于是我们转型做“交易所即服务 (SaaS)”，为 30 多家交易所提供系统。直到 2017 年 3 月，中国政府关闭了我们大部分客户。我们必须再次转型。2017 年 6 月，我决定做自己的币币交易所，并进行 **ICO**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: In 2015, I with a couple of my old colleagues said we're going to do a Bitcoin exchange in Tokyo. But investors said you won't be successful because you don't speak Japanese. They said why don't you sell the technology to other exchanges. So we pivoted to an exchange systems provider. In March 2017 the Chinese government shut down most of our clients. By end of May we said why don't we do our own crypto-to-crypto only trading. In June 2017 I said we're going to do an ICO.

</details>

**Chamath**: 币安的 ICO 筹了多少钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: How much did you raise?

</details>

**CZ**: 筹了 1500 万美元。我们发行了 **BNB** 代币，承诺持有者可以享受 50% 的手续费折扣。2017 年 7 月平台上线，但 9 月中国就发布了禁令。我们决定全员搬迁到东京。当时团队只有 30 人，几乎都没成家，大家收拾行李就走了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Raised $15 million. We launched the token BNB. September 4th, Chinese government issued a memo saying crypto exchanges are no longer allowed. I said let's move to Tokyo. We had like 30 people then. Everybody just packed up and moved.

</details>

### 爆发式增长与监管博弈

**Chamath**: 币安是一夜成名的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: When you first launched Binance, was it an instant hit?

</details>

**CZ**: 产品的增长非常快，因为我们的系统比竞争对手快得多。肉眼可见地快。2017 年底，我们已经是全球第一的交易所。我记得有一些超现实的时刻，我问财务我们的收入是多少，她说几百个比特币。我当时觉得这不可能，一定是算错了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: The product was growing pretty well. Placing an order on Binance is so much faster than on competing platform. By that New Year's Eve 2017 we were number one exchange already. There were some really surreal moments. I asked team what's our revenue? She said like a couple hundred Bitcoins. I was like, that's crazy. This number can't be correct.

</details>

**Chamath**: 2018 年初你登上了《福布斯》封面。作为一个 40 岁才致富的人，金钱对你意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Early 2018 Forbes put you on the cover. What is money when you're in your 40s and you make it?

</details>

**CZ**: 钱很重要，但不是一切。我 40 多岁了，性格很稳，不会去买兰博基尼或开疯狂派对。我现在的房子还是三四手的旧房子，客厅每个月都会漏水，但它大小合适，功能齐全。我是一个功能驱动的人，只要能解决问题，我不关心它是否奢华。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Money is not everything. I'm not like a young 20-year-old that just you know Lambos, big parties. I have a very comfortable life. My house is an old house that I bought third or fourth hand. The living room water leaks every month or so. But I'm function driven. If it functions, I'm okay. I don't care about the fanciness.

</details>

**Chamath**: 什么时候事情开始变得复杂？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: When did things at Binance start to get complicated for you?

</details>

**CZ**: 2021 年左右，美国政府开始要求提供信息。到了 2022 年底，态度变得更加敌对。2023 年初，情况变得很明确：要么达成协议，要么被起诉。那是非常有压力的时期。我每天要和 20 多个律师开会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: They started asking for information in 2021. Late 2022 it was getting more hostile. In early 2023 it was more clear that we either reach a deal of some kind or they're going to indict us. It was very stressful. Daily calls with like 12-20 lawyers on call for more than a year.

</details>

### 认罪、监狱与未来

**Chamath**: 你最终同意了认罪协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: You eventually agreed to the final terms.

</details>

**CZ**: 是的，我承认了一项违反《银行保密法》的指控，即未能注册为金融服务公司。这在历史上从未有人因此入狱。政府还想增加两项指控，说我个人协助了非法交易，但法院驳回了，因为他们没有任何证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Yeah, I validated a single charge of a banking secrecy violation, which is a registration failure. No one went to jail for this in history. The government want to add two additional charges, they call enhancements. The court outright rejected those because they couldn't provide any evidence.

</details>

**Chamath**: 在监狱里的生活是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: What was it like in prison?

</details>

**CZ**: 那是一个非常糟糕的经历。监狱里按种族分群，这其实避免了很多冲突。我所在的群组只有六个人，包括亚洲人和太平洋岛民。我被送进了一个低安全级别的监狱，那里大多是毒贩。我学会了如何保持低调，不要随便接受别人的好意。出狱后，我做的第一件事就是洗个痛快的澡，吃一盘新鲜水果。在监狱里，我几个月没见过完整的水果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: It's a really bad experience overall. They organize prisons by race. This actually does avoid a lot of conflicts. I was sent to a low security prison where all the drug laws are. The first thing I did when I got out was a good shower and a good meal. I haven't seen a whole fruit for like months.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你现在不能再经营币安了，这让你难过吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: You couldn't run Binance per se. Did that make you sad?

</details>

**CZ**: 卸任时我确实哭了，那是我人生中极少数流泪的时刻。但现在我挺开心的，我有更多自由时间。我现在专注于 **Giggle Academy**，这是一个免费的数字化教育平台，旨在为全球 12 亿无法接受教育的人提供服务。我不打算在这个项目里发币，我希望它是一个纯粹的教育平台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Stepping down was really really hard. I actually cried. But after a while I was like I'm actually quite happy not to run Binance. I have a lot more free time. I do Giggle Academy, this free education platform. I will for a very long time resist issue a token on the Giggle Academy. I want it to be a real free education platform instead of a token platform.

</details>

**Chamath**: 你对未来的 AI 代理和加密货币有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: What's your vision for AI agents and crypto?

</details>

**CZ**: 未来我们每个人都会有成千上万个 **AI 代理**在后台为我们工作。它们需要支付，而它们不会去银行开户，因为银行无法对 AI 进行 KYC。AI 代理将是加密货币最大的用户。它们会以极高的频率进行交易，传统银行网络根本无法支撑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: Soon each of us going to have like hundreds or thousands of agents working for us in the background and they will be transacting. They're not going to use banks. Banks won't onboard and AML KYC an agent. Agents will transact at a transaction volume and at a rate that'll make the traditional network's head spin.

</details>

**Chamath**: 最后，你想对那些视你为榜样的人说些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Finally, what do you want to say to people who look up to you?

</details>

**CZ**: 我只是个普通人，并不超级聪明。成功需要价值观、情商和大量的运气。你无法改变环境，只能改变自己。每天逼自己进步一点点，坚持 30 年，如果你运气够好，你就会成功。金钱只是生活的一个维度，一旦够用了，更多的钱并不会让你更快乐。健康、家庭和对社会的积极影响才是最重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CZ**: I'm a normal dude. I don't think I'm super smart. There's a lot of luck as well. You usually cannot change the situation, so what you can only do is change yourself. If you just push yourself a little bit every day for like 30 years and you get lucky, you will be successful. Money is only one tangent. Once you have enough, more doesn't make you happy. Health, family, and positive impact are extremely important.
