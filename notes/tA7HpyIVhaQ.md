title: 特朗普支持者在明尼阿波利斯事件后对移民政策的立场分歧
summary: 本期节目探讨了美国前总统**特朗普**的选民在明尼阿波利斯发生联邦特工击毙两名美国公民事件后，对移民执法政策所产生的复杂情绪与分歧。许多选民最初坚定支持**特朗普**全面打击非法移民的行动，但在目睹政府执法过度和无辜公民伤亡后，开始重新审视其立场。节目采访了多位**特朗普**支持者，他们有的对自己的投票感到后悔，认为政府“欺骗”了他们；有的则像**威尔克·威尔金森**和**约翰·派马**一样，虽然对执法方式表示担忧，但仍坚信大规模驱逐非法移民的必要性，认为这是为了保护美国本土工人利益，并认为公民应避免干预执法行动。

### 移民政策与政府执法冲突

**Michael Bubaro**: 大家好，我是《纽约时报》的**迈克尔·布巴罗**，这里是《每日》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bubaro. This is the daily.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 如何处理无证移民的问题，长期以来一直将**特朗普**总统和他的支持者紧密联系在一起。以至于在过去一年里，绝大多数支持者都支持他全面打击非法移民的行动。但随后，明尼阿波利斯在过去几周发生了一系列非同寻常的事件，联邦特工在街头击毙了两名美国公民。突然之间，MAGA运动的两个最大优先事项——打击非法移民和反对政府越权——以最生动的方式发生了冲突。今天，我们采访了**特朗普**的选民，了解他们如何理解这场冲突，以及在某些情况下，这如何从根本上改变了他们对总统的看法。今天是2月9日星期一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: The question of what to do about undocumented immigrants has long bonded President Trump to his supporters. So much so that an overwhelming majority of them back his allout crackdown over the past year. But then came the extraordinary events of the past few weeks in Minneapolis where federal agents killed two American citizens in the streets. Suddenly, two of the MAGA movement's biggest priorities, fighting illegal immigration and fighting government overreach were colliding in the most vivid way imaginable. Today we speak with Trump voters about how they're making sense of that clash and how in some cases it's fundamentally changing their view of the president. It's Monday, February 9th.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你好，我是《纽约时报》的**凯特琳**。你好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Hi, this is Caitlyn calling from the New York Times. How are you?

</details>

**Jessica Chung**: 你好，我叫**杰西卡·钟**，我们前段时间在马里科帕共和党办公室见过面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessica Chung**: Hi, my name is Jessica Chung and we met a while ago around the Maricopa Republicans office.

</details>

**旁白**: 在过去几周，随着明尼苏达州的紧张局势升级，《每日》的制作人**凯特琳·奥基夫**和**杰西卡·钟**采访了十几位在上次选举中投票给**唐纳德·特朗普**的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Over the past few weeks, as tensions in Minnesota ramped up, Daily Producers Caitlyn O'Keeffe and Jessica Chung spoke with over a dozen people who voted for Donald Trump in the last election.

</details>

**受访者**: 我在马萨诸塞州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: I'm in Massachusetts.

</details>

**受访者**: 哦，是吗？我现在正在车库里和你说话。我们聊天的时候我正在抽雪茄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Oh, you are? I'm in my garage talking to you right now. I'm smoking a cigar while we're having this conversation.

</details>

**受访者**: 不错，哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Nice. Wow.

</details>

**旁白**: 对他们中的许多人来说，移民一直是他们投票的主要原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: For many of them, immigration had been a major reason for that vote.

</details>

**受访者**: 我记得他们描绘了一幅画面，说有一个大型的“大篷车队”，他们就是这么称呼的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: I remember they painted the picture that there was a large caravan. That's what they called it.

</details>

**受访者**: 持续不断的移民大篷车涌入。我的印象是人们成群结队地过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: A continuous flow of migrant caravans coming up. That was my impression is that people were coming over in droves

</details>

**受访者**: 看起来有1万、2万、3万人甚至更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: and it looked like there was 10, 20, 30,000 people or more

</details>

**受访者**: 然后他们会说：“哦，是的，你知道，有这么多中国人越境而来。”就像你会听到一些随机的事情，然后你会想：“等等，什么？发生了什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: and then they were like, "Oh yeah, you know, there's all these Chinese people coming through the border." Like it was just like random things you would hear and you're like, "Wait, what? What is going on?"

</details>

**旁白**: 从**特朗普**宣誓就职第二任期的那一刻起，他们就对他如此迅速而果断地采取行动关闭边境印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: And from the moment Trump was sworn in for a second term, they were impressed with just how quickly and decisively he took action to close the border.

</details>

**受访者**: 哦，我觉得他做得非常棒。这简直是超乎寻常的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Oh, I think he did a fantastic job with it. This is absolutely extraordinary.

</details>

**受访者**: 他只是使用了现有的法律。他说：“好吧，边境关闭了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: And he just used existing laws. He said, "Okay, borders closed."

</details>

**受访者**: 我们从每天被入侵，变成了边境有法律和秩序的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: We went from being invaded on a daily basis to borders where law and order prevailed.

</details>

**受访者**: 我们一直听到人们说移民系统坏了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: We keep hearing people talk about how the immigration system's broken.

</details>

**受访者**: 嗯，移民法确实坏了。然而，事实上，我们发现那不是真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Well, the immigration laws are broken. Yet, in fact, we discovered that was not true.

</details>

**受访者**: 它没有坏，只是没有被执行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: It's not broken. It's just not enforced.

</details>

**受访者**: 你只需要执行它们。多么新颖的概念啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: You just simply need to enforce them. What a novel concept.

</details>

**受访者**: 一旦他们关闭了边境，下一步就是把那些非法入境的人赶出去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Once they closed the border, then the next step was to get people out that came in illegally.

</details>

**旁白**: 实际上，这意味着向美国城市街头部署数千名联邦特工。这意味着针对**ICE**和**边境巡逻队**的大规模抗议。国民警卫队进入社区，法院拘留，以及联邦特工出现在工作场所、商店和学校附近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: In practice, that meant deploying thousands of federal agents into the streets of American cities. It meant huge protests against ICE and Border Patrol. The National Guard going into neighborhoods, detentions at courouses, and federal agents showing up at workplaces, at stores, and near schools.

</details>

**儿童**: 看到我们的朋友和老师被催泪瓦斯袭击仍然很可怕。你在学校吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**儿童**: It's still really scary to see our friends and teachers get um teargassed. Were you at the school?

</details>

**旁白**: 此时，一些**特朗普**的选民开始重新考虑他们对总统计划的支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: At that point, some of Trump's voters began to rethink their support for the president's plan.

</details>

**受访者**: 他们抓孩子，或者他们抓美国公民，拘留他们，然后把他们塞进面包车后面，却不给他们合理的怀疑理由，说明为什么要带走他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: They're grabbing kids or they're grabbing US citizens, detaining them, and putting them in the back of the van and not giving them reasonable suspicion as to why they're being taken away.

</details>

**受访者**: 我不知道会发生那样的事情。那些通过合法途径办事的人，去移民局处理文件过期或公民申请下一步流程的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: I did not know that things like that would happen. People that are doing this the legal way, that are going to the immigration office to take care of a lapse of paperwork or the next step in their process to become a citizen.

</details>

**受访者**: 这是错的。他们这样做是不人道的，我不支持。我当时想，我要站出来，尽我所能去抗议，和我的同胞们站在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: This is wrong. The way they're going about this is inhumane and I don't support it. I was like, I want to go and step up and do what I can and protest and be with my fellow humanity.

</details>

**旁白**: 随后，一名**ICE**特工开枪击毙了一名美国公民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: And then an ICE agent shot and killed a US citizen.

</details>

### 公民死亡引发的重新思考

**受访者**: 最近发生在**蕾妮·古德**身上的情况，令人难以置信地看清了正在发生的事情，以及本届政府将如何处理未来的事情。这对于像肯塔基州列克星敦的**克里斯·斯蒂内特**和佐治亚州亚特兰大的**卡特·布朗**这样的人来说，是一个警钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: The most recent situation that happened with Renee Good was an unbelievable eyeopener to what was going on and how this administration was going to handle things moving forward. That was a kind of wakeup call for people like Chris Stinett in Lexington, Kentucky, and Carter Brown in Atlanta, Georgia.

</details>

**受访者**: 我告诉一个亲近的人，那可能发生在我们任何一个人身上。她给我的回复是：“嗯，我希望你比那更有理智，永远不要出现在那样的地方。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: I told someone close to me that like that could have been any of us. And her reply back to me was, "Well, I'd hope you'd have more sense than to ever be at somewhere like that."

</details>

**旁白**: 他们甚至开始怀疑：“那可能是我或我的家人吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: They even started to wonder, "Could that have been me or a member of my family?"

</details>

**受访者**: 起初，我不知道她的种族。这让我崩溃了。然后发现她后来是白人，这让我更害怕了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: At first, I didn't know her race. It It broke me. And then to find out that she was white afterwards, it scared me even more.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你的妻子也有类似的感觉吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Does your wife also feel similarly?

</details>

**受访者**: 哦，百分之百。她非常沮丧。她37岁，所以这让她有点感同身受，因为**蕾妮·古德**也是37岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Oh, 100%. She's been very upset. She's 37 and so that resonates with her a little bit because Renee Good was 37

</details>

**受访者**: 而且她也是一位母亲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: and she's also a mom.

</details>

**旁白**: 他们曾认为**特朗普**的执法行动会集中在“最坏的坏人”身上，那些有暴力犯罪记录的人。但这次事件并非如此。**卡特**和**克里斯**在过去三届总统选举中都支持**唐纳德·特朗普**，现在他们都表示后悔自己的投票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: They had believed that Trump's enforcement actions would focus on the worst of the worst, people who had a record of committing violent crimes. This wasn't that. Both Carter and Chris, who supported Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections, now say that they regret their vote.

</details>

**受访者**: 人们讨厌我用“被骗”这个词，但那是我从旁观者的角度描述我感受的最佳方式。你知道，你会觉得这就像一场开卷考试，一切都在那里。我刚离开的那个社区，很多人都挂着“别踩我”的旗帜。但你知道他们对**蕾妮**事件的回复是什么吗？“服从就行了。”所以到底是什么？是“别踩我”还是“服从就行了”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: People hate that I use the word bamboozled, but that's the best way that I can describe how I feel on the outside looking in. You know, you're like, it was an open book test. Everything was right there. The community that I just left, many of them have don't tread on me flags flying. But you know what their reply back to what happened with Renee is? Just comply. So what is it? Don't tread on me or just comply.

</details>

**受访者**: 如果我们把所有人都赶走，路上还会有多少人死去？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: If we remove everybody, how many more people will die along the way?

</details>

**旁白**: 当然，并非所有有疑虑的人都后悔投票给**特朗普**。对他们中的一些人来说，情况更为复杂。**凯特琳·奥基夫**联系到了明尼苏达州的一位这样的选民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: But of course, not everyone with misgivings regrets their vote for Trump. For some of them, it's more complicated. Caitlyn O'Keeffe reached one such voter in Minnesota.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你能介绍一下自己吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Can I just have you introduce yourself?

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 是的，我是**威尔克·威尔金森**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: Yeah, I am Wilk Wilkinson. Uh,

</details>

**旁白**: 几周前，我打电话给**威尔克·威尔金森**。他50岁，住在明尼阿波利斯城外约40英里的清水镇附近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: a couple weeks ago, I called Wilk Wilkinson. He's 50 years old and he lives about 40 miles outside of Minneapolis near Clear Water.

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我从小在餐馆工作，做建筑，开卡车，是一种非常蓝领的氛围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: Grew up uh working in restaurants, working construction, truck driving, very kind of a bluecollar atmosphere.

</details>

**旁白**: 他说右翼的民粹主义信息引起了他的共鸣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: He says the populist message of the right resonated with him.

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我在2016年、2020年和2024年都投票给了**唐纳德·特朗普**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I uh I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020 and 2024.

</details>

**旁白**: 现在他为一家旨在弥合政治分歧的非营利组织工作。我想了解他是如何看待家乡州正在进行的移民执法之战的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Now he works for a nonprofit that aims to bridge political divides. I wanted to understand how he was thinking about the battle over immigration enforcement going on in his home state.

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我完全同意这样的观点：我们国家有太多非法入境的人，他们没有以正确的方式行事，我们是一个法治国家，这些法律必须得到维护。但做事也有正确的方式和错误的方式。当1月24日新闻爆出联邦特工在明尼阿波利斯击毙了一名名叫**亚历克斯·普雷伊**的男子时，**威尔**去寻找了视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I agree fully with the idea that we have far too many people in this country who came here illegally and have not done things the right way and we we are a nation of laws and those laws have to be upheld. But there is also a right way to do things in a wrong way. When the news broke on January 24th that federal agents had killed a man in Minneapolis named Alex Prey, Will went looking for the video.

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 当我最初看到第一个视频，然后听到国土安全部部长**克里斯蒂·诺姆**的叙述时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: You know, when I initially saw the first video and then I heard the narrative coming out of Secretary of Homeland Security Christy Gnome,

</details>

**克里斯蒂·诺姆**: 我确实想谈谈我们今天在明尼阿波利斯街头发生的悲剧情况。这发生在国土安全部执法部门执行其合法职责以确保美国人安全的过程中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**克里斯蒂·诺姆**: I do want to address the tragic situation that we saw in Minneapolis today that unfolded on the streets. It occurred uh with DHS law enforcement as they carried out their lawful duties to keep Americans safe in

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我听到她说了什么。她说这个人阻碍了他们的执法行动，袭击了那些警官，他身上有武器和几十发弹药，意图伤害这些警官，他那样挥舞武器并阻碍了他们正在做的工作。我们会继续。我首先寻找的是任何可以被认为是挥舞枪支的方式，因为那是立即出现的叙述。我想，我必须看看我是不是错过了什么。这里发生了我没有看到的事情吗？我看了网上所有的视频，看了好几遍。我把它导入我的软件，放慢，加快，试图让一切都说得通。然后我立即看到，不幸的是，这完全是**克里斯蒂·诺姆**的捏造。我想，这太糟糕了。太糟糕了。我非常失望。我必须说实话，因为当她是南达科他州州长时，我是**克里斯蒂·诺姆**的忠实粉丝。但后来我认为更令人失望的是，他们坚持不放，然后事情立即变得部落化了。人们站到了自己的立场，进入了自己的小圈子，开始为他们以前绝不会原谅的事情找借口，这对我个人来说是最大的心碎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I heard her say what she said. This individual went and impeded their law enforcement operations, attacked those officers, had a weapon on him and multiple dozens of rounds of ammunition wishing to inflict harm on these officers coming brandishing like that and impeding their work that they were doing. We'll continue. The first thing that I was looking for was any way that it could be considered, you know, brandishing a firearm because that was the immediate narrative that came out. I'm like, I've got to see if I'm missing something. Is there something happening here that I am not seeing? I watched every single video that I think is online. I watched it several times. I dropped it into my software, slowed it down, sped it up, trying to make it all make sense. and uh saw immediately that it was an outright fabrication on the part of Christy Gnome, unfortunately. And and I'm like, this is awful. Awful. And I was so disappointed. I I got to be honest, cuz I was a huge Christy Gnome fan when she was the governor of South Dakota. But then I think what was more disappointing was they stuck to it and then it instantly became tribalized. people went to their side, went to their silos and started excusing things that they would never, ever, ever otherwise excuse was the biggest heartbreak for me personally.

</details>

**旁白**: 另一件让**威尔克**担心的事情是，**特朗普**政府在枪击事件后出来说，**普雷伊**携带枪支参加抗议活动是违法的。正如**克里斯蒂**所说，你不能携带装有多发弹匣的枪支参加任何你想要的抗议活动。就这么简单。你没有权利违法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Another thing that concerned Wilk was the Trump administration coming out after the shooting, saying that it was unlawful for Pretty to bring a gun to a protest. As Christie said, you cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple. You don't have that right to break the law.

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我会这么说，**凯特琳**，我是一名隐蔽持枪者。你知道，我是一个**第二修正案**的绝对主义者。我这辈子都在接触枪支。他当时所在的地方，法律允许他持枪吗？是的，允许。**联邦调查局**局长**卡什·帕特尔**显然说错了，**克里斯蒂·诺姆**也显然说错了。他们如此随意地发表这些明显错误的言论，这表明是的，**第二修正案**正面临被本届政府侵犯的危险。那么，**亚历克斯·普雷伊**在做他所做的事情时携带武器是否明智？不，一点也不。那是一个非常非常非常糟糕的人生选择，无疑导致了他被杀。这一点毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I mean, I I will say this, Kaitlin, I'm a concealed carrier. You know, I'm a Second Amendment absolutist. I, you know, I've been around guns literally my whole life. And was he allowed to carry a gun where he was by law? Yes, he was. Cash Patel, the FBI director, was clearly wrong about stating what he stated. Christy Gnome was clearly wrong about stating what she stated. The fact that they play so fast and loose with making statements like that when they were clearly wrong says yes, the Second Amendment is in danger of being violated by this administration. Now, was it smart that Alex Freddy was armed while he was doing what he was doing? No, not at all. It was a very, very, very poor life choice that certainly contributed to him be getting killed. There's no question about that.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 发生在**普雷伊**身上的事情，那个视频，是否以任何方式改变了你对**特朗普**政府及其移民政策执行方式的看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Does what happened to Prey? Does that video change in any way the way that you think about the Trump administration and its enforcement of immigration policies?

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我会说这些政策的执行方式，或者说以前的执行方式，我认为**汤姆·霍尔曼**实际上带来了一种以前没有的冷静和深思熟虑，但以前的执行方式是完全错误的。在我看来，保守派应该对政府的武力持怀疑态度，政府的唯一职责是保护个人免受不当武力和欺诈。我确实看到了联邦政府正在实施不当武力，我百分之百反对。当他们开始对这个国家的公民使用不当武力时，它改变了这种关系的动态，这是一个非常非常非常大的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I would say that the way that these policies are being enforced or were I think Tom Holman actually introduces a level of calm and consideration that wasn't there before but the way that they were being enforced was all wrong. Conservatives are supposed to be in my opinion suspect of government force and the government's sole role is to protect the individual from undue force and fraud. I was definitely seeing an element of undue force being perpetrated by the federal government, which I am 100% against. When they begin to use undue force on the citizens of this country, it changes the dynamic of that relationship and it's a very very very big deal.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 那么你以前对大规模驱逐出境的看法是什么？比如目标是什么？在过去一年和过去一周里，你的看法有所改变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: And what were your views on mass deportations before like the goal? And you know, have they changed in the past year and also in the past week?

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 所以我对大规模驱逐出境以及我们需要驱逐非法入境者的看法没有改变。不是因为这次事件，也不是因为明尼苏达州正在发生的事情。只是因为在我看来，某种事情的实施方式是令人发指的。它只是极其无效和无能。但这并没有改变我认为这件事本身仍然是正确的事情这一事实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: So my opinion of of mass deportations and the idea that we need to deport people who are in this country illegally has not changed. Not because of this event, not because of what's happening in Minnesota. Just because the way that something is being implemented, in my opinion, is egregious. It's just terribly ineffective and incompetent. does not change the fact that I think that the thing itself is still the right thing to do.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 那么，说**特朗普**总统仍然得到你的支持，但他们需要做得更好，这样公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: So, is it fair to say that President Trump still has your support, but they need to do better?

</details>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: 我会说**宪法**得到了我的支持。我的意思是，**特朗普**政府仍然在做一些我完全支持的事情。就继续支持本届政府而言，我唯一能说的是，如果**卡玛拉·哈里斯**赢得了选举，我认为我想要的任何事情都不会在这一点上实现，甚至可能会让几件事情变得更糟。所以，就是这样。我至少以这种方式得到了一些东西。但我们仍然面临一个非常非常非常大的问题，那就是一个似乎不太尊重**第一修正案**、**第二修正案**、**第四修正案**以及可能其他几项修正案的政府。老实说，这确实是个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**威尔克·威尔金森**: I would say that the Constitution has my support. I mean, there are still some things that that the Trump administration is doing that I fully support. And the only thing that I can say in terms of continuing to support this administration is if Camala Harris had won the election, I don't think anything that I wanted would have been accomplished at this point and probably even made several things worse. So, there's that. I'm still at least this way getting something. But we still have a really, really, really big problem with an administration that doesn't seem to have a lot of regard for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and probably several others. Let's be honest, it's it's problematic.

</details>

**旁白**: 最近的民意调查显示，约30%的共和党人认为移民执法策略走得太远，但绝大多数人表示，要么进展顺利，要么需要进一步加强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Recent polling shows that about 30% of Republicans think immigration enforcement tactics have gone too far, but the vast majority say it's either on track or needs to go even further

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 看看**特朗普**政府目前正在推行的大规模驱逐出境政策，你有什么不同的做法吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: looking at how the Trump administration is currently pursuing mass deportations. Is there anything you would do differently?

</details>

**受访者**: 就**特朗普**政府而言，不，并没有什么不同。他正在做他竞选时承诺的所有事情。他正在做我雇他做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: As far as the Trump administration goes, no, not really. He's doing all the things that he promised while he was running. He's doing what I hired him to do.

</details>

**受访者**: 我认为这正是我投票支持的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: I think it's exactly what I voted for.

</details>

**受访者**: 所以，如果你问我，现在坐下来抱怨他正在做这些事情，这有点愚蠢。如果你投票给他，你就需要全力支持他。我的问题不在于驱逐出境。我的问题是这些所谓的抗议者正在煽动，好像他们希望发生这样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: So to sit back and complain that he's doing those things now is kind of stupid if you ask me. If you voted for him, you need to be supporting him all the way. My problem isn't with the deportations. My problem is that these so-called protesters are instigating like they want stuff like this to happen.

**受访者**: I know this sounds very harsh, but you play stupid games. You win stupid prizes. You know, you make stupid choices, you get stupid consequences. I still support the deportation policy.

**受访者**: 非法移民是错误的。无论你怎么看，人们都必须离开这个国家。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**受访者**: Illegal immigration is wrong. No matter how you look at it, people have to leave the country.

**受访者**: 你知道，每当他们说我们要清除非法移民，我们要关闭边境时，没有人真正说过那会是什么样子。或者，比如说，做烧烤。我不知道。你喜欢烤猪肉吗？

<details>

**受访者**: You know, whenever they say we're going to get rid of the illegals and we're going to close the border, nobody ever says exactly what that's going to look like. Or let's say making barbecue for instance. I don't know. Do you like barbecued pork?

**约翰·派马**: 我叫**约翰**。我53岁。我是一名泥瓦匠。我住在马萨诸塞州。我一生都在建筑行业，我拥有一家非常小的公司。我有一个妻子，两个孩子，嗯，这就是我的概况。

**约翰·派马**: My name is John. I'm 53 years old. I'm a Mason. I live in Massachusetts. I've been in in the construction industry my whole life and I own a very small company. Um, I have a wife, two kids, and um, that's me in a nutshell.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Is there a political party that you have historically identified with?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 嗯，最初在我高中时期和之后几年，应该是民主党。然后我通常会变得保守。我在2024年投票给了**特朗普**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: Um, initially it would have been the Democratic party when I was in high school and probably a few years after. And then I generally kind of turned conservative and I voted for Trump in 2024.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 嗯哼。你2016年投票给他了吗？你一直觉得他是一个你信任的政治家吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Uh-huh. And did you vote for him in 16? You know, have you always felt like he is a politician that you've believed in?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 所以在2016年、2020年和2024年，我相信我得到了一个选择，恕我直言，我得到了一个选择，要么吃屎，要么喝尿。在所有这三种情况下，我都喝了尿。所以这就是你的答案。在所有这三种情况下，我都投票给了**特朗普**。所以这就是我对这个人有多大的热情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: So in 2016, 2020, and 2024, I believe I was given the option, and excuse my French, I was given the option to eat [ __ ] or drink piss. And in all three cases, I drank piss. So there's your answer. And in all three cases, I voted for Trump. So that's how much passion I have for the man.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 嗯哼。你在2024年投票时，对你来说最重要的问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Mhm. What were the most important issues to you when you cast your ballot in 2024?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 嗯，移民是一个主要问题，但这在我一生中一直是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: Well, immigration was a major issue, but that has been an issue my whole entire life.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 我能问为什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Can I ask why?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 嗯，因为我做的工作。简单来说，我用身体搬运重物。我工作的根本就是体力劳动者。我搬东西，我拿起东西，我放下东西。而这种工作受到了非法移民的极大损害。我进入建筑行业纯属偶然。我有点像个少年犯，我的表弟**泰德**在楠塔基特岛的一家园林建筑公司为我工作，我去了那里，做了一名体力劳动者，然后随着我做下去，你知道，我成了一个相当不错的体力劳动者。后来我为其他公司工作，我看到有人被雇佣，他们的工资比我低得多。当我询问时，我的老板会说：“嗯，他们更便宜。我不需要为他们支付工伤赔偿。我不需要为他们支付一般责任保险。如果他们受伤了，他们会去急诊室。我一点也不费力。”我的工资越来越低，因为我正在与那些因为雇佣成本更低而被雇佣的人竞争。这让我很困扰。然后当我成为一名泥瓦匠并开始建造时，我发现我正在与那些采取这种做法的公司竞争。我不能雇佣非法外国人。这看起来不对。顺便说一下，这是非法的，但人们却逍遥法外。而我正在与他们竞争。你只需简单地看到那些出去工作的团队就能注意到这一点。当你给别人一个工作报价时，你甚至都接近不了最低价或中等价。你总是最高价。我永远也得不到一定比例的工作。然后我不能提高我的费率，因为这是一个不公平的市场。我喜欢为自己工作的想法，我能做这份工作，而且我很擅长，但现在我年纪越来越大，做起来越来越难，尤其是我现在不能雇佣一个体力劳动者，因为我觉得我不能给他们一份足以维持生计的工资。所以，现在只有我一个人在做这份工作，这让我很吃力，但我会努力保持身材，继续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: Uh because of what I do. To be kind of simple, I move mass with my body. I'm a laborer at the very root of what I do. I move things. I pick things up. I put things down. And that kind of work has been compromised by illegal immigration greatly. I got into construction purely as an accident. I was sort of a juvenile delinquent a bit and my cousin Ted worked for me in Nucket for a landscape construction company and I went down there and I worked as a laborer and then as I did it I I you know I became a pretty good laborer. Later I worked for other companies and I was seeing people getting hired and getting paid a lot less than me. And when I inquired about it, my boss would say, "Well, they're less expensive. I don't have to pay workman's comp on them. I don't have to pay general liability insurance on them. If they get hurt, they'll go to the emergency room. No sweat off my back." And I was getting paid less and less because I was competing against people who were hired because it cost less to hire them or employ them. That bothered me. And then when I became a Mason and I started building, I found that I was competing with companies that did that practice. And I I couldn't hire an illegal alien. I I just didn't seem right. And it's illegal, by the way, but people are getting away with it. And I'm competing against them. And you notice it by just simply seeing the crews that are going out there. And when you give a price to somebody to do work, you're not even close to the lowest or the mid price. You're always the highest price. And I'm never going to get a certain percentage of jobs. And then I can't increase my rate because it's an unfair marketplace. I like the idea of working for myself and I could do the work and I was good at it, but it's getting to the point I'm getting older and it's harder to do, especially now I can't I can't hire a laborer because I don't feel that I can give them an um a living wage. So, it's just me doing the work, which is it's beating me up quite a bit, but um try to stay in shape and I keep going.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你觉得在**拜登**执政期间，这个问题更严重了吗？移民劳工竞争的问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Did you feel under Biden that that problem was worse? The problem of competition from immigrant labor?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 不，它一直在稳步恶化。最近让我对此的思考过程有所收敛的是**特朗普**在他第二任期在边境所做的事情，他立即关闭了边境口岸。一直追溯到我开始工作的时候，我想当时**老布什**是总统，我们就有非法移民问题。似乎每位总统都有机会阻止非法移民涌入边境，但他们中没有一个，无论是民主党还是共和党，对此采取了任何行动。而事实是，正如我们所见，它本可以如此迅速地完成，这让我有点警觉。这让我觉得自己作为一名美国工人，作为一名工薪阶层被遗忘了。他们谈论这个国家的工薪阶层。他们谈论这个国家的企业主是国家的支柱。但政客们不相信这一点，或者他们不对此采取行动。那么，这引出了我想问你的下一个问题，那就是你如何看待**特朗普**总统在他第二任期的第一年迄今在移民问题上所做的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: No, it's been steadily getting worse. What recently kind of narrowed down my thought process on that was what Trump did at the border his second term. by immediately shutting it down the border crossings. All the way back to when I started working when I think it was Bush Senior was president, uh we had illegal immigration problems. It seems like every president had an opportunity to stop that flood of illegal immigrants going over the border and none of them, Democrat or Republican, did anything about it. And the fact that it could have been done so quickly as we have seen is a little alarming to me. It makes me feel like I'm forgotten as an American worker, as a workingclass person. They talk about the working class in this country. They talk about the business owners in this country being the backbone of the country. But politicians don't believe that or they don't act on that. Well, this brings me to the next question that I wanted to ask you, which is how do you feel about what President Trump has done on immigration so far this first year of his second term?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 我想说他做得够多了。我不认为他做到了，但这个国家似乎无法处理。我认为我们没有胆量去面对它。需要发生什么？**ICE**不应该被置于必须与国家公民作战的境地，去做一件本不该发生的工作。我们不应该有非法移民这个问题，但现在我们有了。我们必须做些什么来解决它，这很难让人接受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: I'd like to say he's doing enough. I don't think he is, but this country seems to not be able to handle it. I don't think we have the stomach for it. What needs to happen? ICE shouldn't be put in a situation where they have to fight citizens of the country to do a job that should have never happened. We shouldn't have had this issue with illegal immigrants, but now we do. It's very hard to stomach what we need to do to take care of it.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你认为需要做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: What do you think needs to be done?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 嗯，我认为我们需要做他正在做的事情。我认为我们确实需要驱逐所有非法移民，无论他们在这里多久。事实上，我对那些非法在这里的人并非没有同情心。他们通常是好人，我认为每个人都同意他们通常不暴力，但在我看来，这就是同情心问题所在。所以，我们对这些需要工作、需要改善生活的人抱有同情心。但我的同情心首先必须放在美国工人身上。如果这里的人找不到**美国梦**，我们真的应该重新考虑我们的移民政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: Well, I think we need to do what he's doing. I think we do need to remove all illegal immigrants, no matter how long they've been here. In fact, I'm not uncompassionate to the people that are illegally here. They are generally good people and I think everyone can agree that they generally aren't violent, but this is where the compassion problem is in my opinion. So, we have compassion for these people who need work and they need to better their lives. But my compassion has to lie with the American worker first. And we should really think about our immigration policy in general if the people here can't find the American dream.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Mhm.

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 我不知道他做得够不够。我担心如果他做得更多，像我们看到的那些事故就会发生，这很可怕。这很可怕。但我们必须退一步问，为什么会发生这种事？为什么明尼苏达州会有**ICE**特工？明尼苏达州不应该有**ICE**特工。我们刚刚关闭了边境。**ICE**特工之所以在明尼苏达州，是因为40年的非法移民问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: I'm don't know if he's doing enough. And I fear that if he did more accidents like we've seen has happened will happen, which is horrible. It's horrible. But we have to step back and say, why did that happen? Why is there an ICE agent in Minnesota? There shouldn't be an ICE agent in Minnesota. We just shut the border down. The ICE agent is in Minnesota because of 40 years of illegal immigration.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 你认为什么时候才算够？你认为正确的最终目标是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Is there a point when you think it will be enough? Like what's the end goal that you think is right?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 我的意思是，理想情况下，你希望你的国家没有非法移民。这能实现吗？我不相信这是可能的。但我不知道。不幸的是，我们现在处于一个境地，当我们解决这个问题时，它会花费金钱。我的意思是，你将不得不支付更多的钱来修剪草坪，修理屋顶。你应该支付更多，因为那是这份工作所需的成本。而做这份工作的人应该赚这么多钱。他们应该过上体面的生活，以实现**美国梦**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: I mean, ideally you want zero illegal immigrants in your country. Is it achievable? I have don't believe it is possible. I don't know though. And unfortunately, we're at the point where when we fix this, it's going to cost money. I mean, you're going to have to pay more to get your lawn cut, your roof done. And you should pay more because that's how much the job takes. And that's how much these people who do this job should make. They should make a living to earn that American dream.

</details>

**旁白**: 在**约翰**和我谈话仅仅一周多之后，联邦特工击毙了**亚历克斯·普雷伊**，这是明尼苏达州在不到一个月内第二位被击毙的美国公民。我再次打电话给**约翰**，看看这是否改变了他的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Just over a week after John and I spoke, federal agents killed Alex Prey, the second US citizen in Minnesota in less than a month. I called John back to see if this had shifted his views.

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 我看了一些视频，但没有分析。我只知道那里可能有一些错误。我不认为他应该被枪杀。我可能认为开枪的警官可能不知道枪已经从他手中拿走了，并且可能听到另一名警官喊“有枪”。所以，视频没有显示这一点存在问题，但我不知道你是否能从那个视频中了解整个故事。我当然没有。我知道有人死了，这是错误的，我知道警官感到威胁，这也是错误的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: I saw some of the video, but I didn't analyze it. I just know that probably there were a couple faults there. I don't believe he should have been shot. I believe probably the officer that shot him may not have known that the gun was taken away from him and may have heard another officer yell gun. So, there's faults with the video not kind of showing that, but I don't know if you can get the whole story out of that video. I certainly didn't. I know that a person died and that's wrong and I know officers felt threatened and that's wrong.

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 然而，最让我困扰的是，在2025年，有人死于非法移民之手。我只是快速查了一下，其中一些情况相当糟糕，我把他们的名字放在谷歌上，看看是否能找到关于他们的新闻报道，我特别去了《纽约时报》，但我放进去的第一个人的新闻报道却没有。关于这个被边境巡逻队枪杀的人，还没有一篇新闻文章，有18篇。我数到18就停了。但是有一个男孩被非法移民杀害了，当时他正在帮助他的母亲，或者阻止她被强奸。就在2025年，没有《纽约时报》的报道。这只是一种道德指南针，我认为已经失落了。所以这让我非常困扰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: However, what bothered me most about the whole thing is that in 2025 there were people that died by the hands of illegal immigrants. I just looked it up quickly and some of them were were pretty bad and I put their names on the Google and to see if I could find news stories about them and I particularly went to the New York Times and there's no news on the first people I put in. Not one news article yet on this man that got shot by the border patrol there's 18. I stopped counting at 18. But there was a boy that got killed by an illegal immigrant when he was helping his mother or stopping her from getting raped. Just 2025, no report from the New York Times. And it's just there's a moral kind of compass there that I think has been lost. So that that that bothers me like a lot.

</details>

**旁白**: 除了围绕**亚历克斯·普雷伊**之死的新闻报道之外，**约翰**告诉我，他还对地方执法部门没有协助联邦移民官员执行驱逐出境感到沮丧。他认为理想情况下，他们应该像一个团队一样合作。但尽管面临这些挑战，尽管有两名美国公民死亡，尽管有抗议活动，**约翰**仍然希望**特朗普**政府在明尼苏达州坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: Beyond the drum beat of news coverage around Alex Py's death, John told me he was also frustrated that local law enforcement wasn't helping federal immigration officials carry out the deportations. That ideally they'd be working together as a team. But despite these challenges, despite the death of two American citizens, despite the protests, John still wanted the Trump administration to stay the course in Minnesota.

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 仅仅因为工作不顺利，并不意味着你停止工作。我相信人们的公民权利和他们的抗议权利。当抗议活动阻止联邦特工执行他的工作时，那就不再是抗议了。你知道，**言论自由修正案**是你可以说任何你想说的话，但你不能在拥挤的电影院里喊“着火了”。你不能把它推向那个极端。你可以在场边抗议。州和地方政府应该在那里确保抗议活动不与联邦官员发生冲突。他们可以抗议，他们有充分的权利，他们也应该这样做。如果他们觉得这不对，他们绝对应该抗议。但他们不应该干预联邦特工追捕非法移民的行动。那是这个国家人民授权的行动方针。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: Just because the job isn't working doesn't mean you stop doing the job. I believe in people's civil rights and their right to protest. When the protests stop a federal agent from doing his job, that's when it stops being protest. You know, the free speech amendment is you can say anything you want, but you can't yell fire in a packed movie theater. You can't take it to that extreme. You can be on the sidelines and protest. And the state and local government should be there making sure the protest is not getting involved with the federal officers. And they can protest and they have every right to and they should. If they don't feel this is right, they should protest absolutely. But they should not get involved in the operations of federal agents going after illegal immigrants. That was a course of action that was mandated by the people of this country.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 嗯哼。有没有一个点，你认为代价会变得太大？追求这个驱逐非法入境者的目标的代价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: Mhm. Is there a point at which the cost becomes too much? The cost of pursuing this goal of deporting people in the country illegally.

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 一条生命就应该太多了。但在这里受到伤害的人，是那些让自己卷入本质上具有风险、暴力、涉及武器的行动的人。它涉及人类移动其他不想被移动的人类。如果有人把自己置于那样的情况中，他们就会遇到问题。就待在家里吧。让政府去做你前任政府让他们做的工作。这不像**特朗普**把这些非法移民带到这些地区，只是为了杀死美国公民。我的意思是，如果你读报纸，听起来就是这样。听起来**特朗普**和他的边境巡逻队开始了这一切。嗯，如果每个人都待在家里，让他们做自己的工作，就不会有死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: One life should be too much. But the people who are getting hurt here are people who are getting themselves involved in a action that is inherently risky, violent. It involves weapons. It involves human beings moving other human beings who don't want to be moved. If someone puts themselves in a situation like that, they're going to have issues. Just stay home. Let the government do the job that your previous government got them into. It's not like Trump brought these illegal immigrants into these areas just so he could kill American citizens. I mean, that's what it sounds like if you read the newspapers. It sounds like Trump started all this and his border patrol started this. Well, if everyone just stayed home and let them do their jobs, there would be no deaths.

</details>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: 我只是想知道，当你想到你希望在10年或20年后生活的移民系统时，理想情况会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Caitlyn O'Keeffe**: I wonder just what does the ideal situation look like when you think about the immigration system you'd like to live under in 10 years or 20 years?

</details>

**约翰·派马**: 我想这取决于这个国家如何对待其最低收入者。所以，如果我们的公民在高中毕业后有能力找到工作，获得一份不错的收入，买房，可能还能养家糊口，那么我们就应该有一个非常自由的移民政策，对来自世界各地所有人的审查一视同仁。我希望它能成为一个真正的世界各地人民的大熔炉。所以这就是我未来所看到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**约翰·派马**: I guess what it would matter on the state of this country in terms of how it treats its lowest income earners. So if we have the ability for a citizens, you know, after high school to get a job, to make a good income, buy a house, possibly to raise a family, then we should have an immigration policy that's very liberal with vetting of all people from all places and have it equal to people of all places. They like it to be an actual melting pot of people all around the world. So that's where I see it in the future.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: We'll be right back. Here's what else you need today. The latest disclosure of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein has led to the resignation of a top aid to Britain's prime minister. On Sunday, Morgan Mweeny, the chief of staff to Prime Minister Kier Starmer, stepped down over his role in the appointment of an Epstein friend as Britain's ambassador to the United States. New emails showed that the ambassador, Peter Mandlesson, had a close relationship with Epstein and even shared sensitive government information with him. Mweeny said that he now regrets recommending Mandlesson for the ambassadorship. The latest Epstein disclosures will be the subject of tomorrow's show. And days after the Washington Post laid off hundreds of journalists, its CEO and publisher Will Lewis has resigned. Lewis, who was appointed by post owner Jeff Bezos, failed to turn around the post's finances and had a strained relationship with its newsroom. That relationship was further inflamed by Lewis's decision not to speak to the newsroom during the layoffs. Instead, around the same time, he was spotted attending an event related to the Super Bowl in San Francisco.
