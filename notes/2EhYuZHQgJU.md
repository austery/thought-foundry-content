### 政府监控与异议压制

近期，美国国土安全部（DHS）被曝出正积极推动社交媒体平台披露批评移民与海关执法局（ICE）的用户的身份信息。据政府官员及未获授权公开谈论此事的科技界人士透露，DHS已向包括Google、Reddit、Discord以及拥有Facebook和Instagram的Meta在内的多家公司发送了数百份行政搜查令。这些搜查令要求提供批评ICE的账号，或发布有关执法人员位置信息的用户的姓名、电子邮件、电话号码及其他身份识别数据。

根据政府官员的说法，Meta、Reddit和Google已部分遵从了这些请求。部分公司表示，它们会先通知账户所有者，并给予10至14天的时间在法庭上对搜查令提出异议。过往，此类搜查令的使用极为罕见，科技界人士曾表示，它们主要用于追踪涉及儿童贩卖等严重犯罪的账户背后人员。然而，特朗普政府正采取强硬手段压制对ICE的批评声音，部分措施包括识别公开反对该机构的美国公民。ICE曾告知明尼阿波利斯和芝加哥的抗议者，他们正被记录并使用面部识别技术进行身份识别。上个月，白宫边境官员在接受采访时表示，正致力于建立一个数据库，收录因“干扰、阻碍袭击”而被捕人员的信息。在法庭上，DHS的律师辩称，寻求这些信息是为了保障ICE执法人员在现场的安全。Meta、Reddit和Discord在回应《纽约时报》关于搜查令的询问时均拒绝置评。Google的一位女发言人则表示：“我们会审查每一项法律要求，并反对那些过于宽泛的要求。”

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, February 16th. Here's what we're covering.

The Times has learned that in recent months, the Department of Homeland Security has been pushing social media sites to reveal the identities of people who criticize ICE online. According to government officials and tech employees who are not authorized to speak publicly, DHS has sent hundreds of administrative subpoenas to Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. It's asked for the names, emails, phone numbers, and other identifying data behind social media accounts that criticize the agency or post about the location of agents.

According to government officials, Meta, Reddit, and Google have all complied with some of the requests. Some of the companies say they notified the account owners first and gave them 10 to 14 days to fight the subpoena in court. In the past, these kind of subpoenas were issued only sparingly. Tech employees told the Times they were primarily used to uncover people behind accounts engaged in serious crimes like child trafficking. But the Trump administration's been aggressively trying to tamp down criticism of ICE, partly by identifying Americans who've spoken out against the agency. ICE told protesters in Minneapolis and Chicago that they were being recorded and identified with facial recognition technology. And last month, the White House border said on Fox News that he was pushing to create a database of people who were arrested for quote interference impeding an assault. In court, DHS lawyers have argued that they're seeking this information to keep ICE agents safe in the field. In response to questions from the Times about the subpoenas, Meta, Reddit, and Discord declined to comment. A Google spokeswoman said, quote, "We review every legal demand and push back against those that are over broad."

### 执法争议与抗议活动

在特朗普政府的移民打击行动方面，还有其他几项快速更新。ICE代理主管表示，有两名特工因在明尼阿波利斯的一起枪击事件中做出虚假陈述而受到停职调查。上个月发生的这起事件中，一名移民特工击伤了一名男子的腿部，政府官员随即急于为使用武力辩护，声称有三人用扫帚和雪铲袭击了该官员，并表示他担心自己的生命安全。然而，这一说法在法庭上不攻自破，因为美国检察官表示该事件的版本不属实。目前，被指控袭击该特工的男子已被撤销指控。涉事特工可能面临解雇或刑事起诉。这是国土安全部提供的一起枪击事件的说法，后来被证明存在疑问或完全错误，这是最新的一个例子。

与此同时，全国范围内，学生们正通过罢课来抗议政府的驱逐政策。在过去几周，美国30多个州的数千名学生走出了课堂，以示对政府驱逐策略的抗议。然而，在德克萨斯州，共和党官员正试图压制这些示威活动。州长格雷格·阿博特（Greg Abbott）已暗示，可能会削减发生抗议活动的学区资金，并逮捕行为失序的学生。阿博特近期还在社交媒体上警告称，允许此类行为发生的学校和教职员工应被视为“共谋者”。尽管面临威胁，罢课行动仍在继续。达拉斯一名16岁的学生告诉《纽约时报》，这些抗议活动对她而言是个人化的，因为她的表亲今年被驱逐出境，留下他的妻子和5岁的儿子与她家人同住。

Now, a few other quick updates on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The acting head of ICE says that two agents have been suspended and are being investigated for making false statements related to a shooting in Minneapolis. In the incident last month, an immigration agent shot a man in the leg and administration officials immediately rushed to justify the use of force, claiming three people had attacked the officer with a broom and a snow shovel and that he feared for his life. That narrative collapsed in court, however, when the US attorney said that version of events was not true. The charges against the men accused of attacking the agent have now been dropped. The agents could be fired or face criminal prosecution. It's the latest example of the Department of Homeland Security providing an account of a shooting that later proved questionable or outright wrong.

And nobody is illegal on stolen land. >> Across the country, no justice, no peace. >> Students in more than three dozen states have walked out of class in recent weeks to protest the administration's deportation tactics. But in Texas, Republican officials are trying to tamp those demonstrations down. Governor Greg Abbott has suggested state funding could be stripped from school districts where there are protests and that students who are disorderly should be arrested. Abbott recently warned on social media that schools and staff who allow this behavior should be treated as co-conspirators.

Despite the threats, the walkouts have continued. One 16-year-old in Dallas told the Times the protests are personal for her. Her cousin was deported this year, leaving his wife and 5-year-old son to move in with her family.

### 地缘政治叙事与军事介入

去年年底，特朗普总统曾出人意料地威胁要“枪炮齐鸣”地派遣美军进入尼日利亚，以保护该国的基督徒。如今，首批美军已抵达当地，参与一项非战斗部署，预计将包括约200名人员。特朗普总统采纳了由多位共和党议员及其他人近几个月来一直推动的观点，即尼日利亚存在一场“持续的基督教种族灭绝”。甚至在圣诞节当天，他还轰炸了该国北部地区，声称是为了保护尼日利亚的基督徒。

《纽约时报》西非局局长露丝·姆兰（Ruth Mlan）指出，理解特朗普总统所推行的这一叙事，关键在于它极大地简化了非洲人口最多国家中一个极为复杂的情况。这是一个非常复杂的国家，存在圣战分子、被人们泛称为“匪徒”的群体（他们经常进行大规模绑架和杀戮），以及分离主义者等各种不同的武装行为者在地面上实施暴力。而受害者群体来自许多不同的背景，包括穆斯林、基督徒以及信奉传统宗教的尼日利亚人。姆兰认为，许多尼日利亚人对这一叙事感到困惑，尤其是它甚至导致了空袭。人们担心美国可能误读了局势，而当世界上最强大的国家介入并向你的国家投掷炸弹时，这可能非常危险。但她也认为，也有不少尼日利亚人对本国政府感到厌倦，并将美国干预视为积极因素，如果这能迫使本国政府采取行动，制止全国范围内影响几乎所有人的暴力事件。

Late last year, President Trump caught some offguard when he threatened to send the US military into Nigeria, quote, guns ablazing, to protect Christians in the country. Now, the first wave of US troops have arrived on the ground there, part of a non-combat deployment that's expected to include about 200 personnel. President Trump has picked up on the idea that has been pushed by a bunch of Republican lawmakers and others for months now that there's what he calls an ongoing Christian genocide in Nigeria. And it's got to the point where, you know, on Christmas day he bombed the north of the country saying that he was trying to protect Nigerian Christians.

>> Ruth Mlan is the Times West Africa bureau chief.

>> The thing to understand about this narrative that President Trump is pushing is that it really oversimplifies what is actually a very complex situation in Africa's most populous country. So a very complex nation. You have jihadists. You have what people loosely term bandits, groups of people who often carry out mass kidnappings and killings. You have separatists, all sorts of different armed actors carrying out this violence on the ground. And the people being killed come from many different sorts of groups and that comprises both Muslims and Christians and people practicing traditional religions in Nigeria. I think a lot of Nigerians are confused by this narrative and the fact that it's even led to things like air strikes. I think a lot of people are worried that the Americans are getting the narrative wrong and that can be a dangerous thing when the most powerful nation in the world is involved and is sending bombs to your country. But I do think that there are plenty of Nigerians as well who are so fed up with their own government and see American intervention as a positive thing if it can force their own government to act and stop the violence that's playing out across the whole country and is affecting practically everybody.

### 名人丑闻与公关危机

在洛杉矶，一家知名人才经纪公司的负责人因其名字出现在“爱泼斯坦文件”（Epstein Files）中而面临公众的强烈反对，并正采取措施应对。凯西·沃瑟曼（Casey Wasserman），出身于好莱坞一个传奇家族，表示他已开始着手出售沃瑟曼集团（Wasserman Group）。该集团代表着从Coldplay乐队到布兰妮·斯皮尔斯（Britney Spears）等数千名艺术家和运动员。在过去一周左右的时间里，包括切尔西·汉（Chelsey Han）和足球明星阿比·瓦姆巴赫（Abby Wambach）在内的数十名客户宣布离开该经纪公司，理由是他们对沃瑟曼曾发送给爱泼斯坦长期同伙兼共犯吉莱恩·麦克斯韦尔（Ghislaine Maxwell）的轻浮邮件感到愤怒。这些邮件可追溯至2003年，即爱泼斯坦首次被捕的数年前。在邮件中，沃瑟曼写给麦克斯韦尔：“我无时无刻不在想你。”在一份向员工道歉的备忘录中，沃瑟曼表示他与麦克斯韦尔和爱泼斯坦只有“有限的接触”。尽管他将退出人才经纪业务，但他仍打算继续担任另一项备受瞩目的职务——2028年洛杉矶奥运会组委会主席。

In Los Angeles, the head of a powerhouse talent agency is bowing to backlash over his name showing up in the Epstein Files. Casey Wasserman, who comes from a legendary Hollywood family, said he's starting the process of selling the Wasserman group, which represents thousands of artists and athletes from Coldplay to Britney Grryer. Over the last week or so, dozens of those clients, including Chapel Ran and the soccer star Abby Wombach, announced they were leaving the agency, saying they were outraged over flirtatious emails Wasserman had sent to Galileain Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and co-conspirator. The emails were from 2003, several years before Epstein was first arrested. In them, Wasserman wrote to Maxwell, quote, I think of you all the time. In a memo apologizing to his staff, Wasserman said he only had quote limited interactions with Maxwell and Epstein. And he has said that even as he steps back from the talent agency, he still intends to stay on in another high-profile role. He's the chair of the organizing committee for the 2028 Olympics in LA.

### 智能家居的隐私困境

最后，关于家庭宠物的话题。宠物是家庭的一份子，但每年有1000万宠物走失。上周，家庭安全公司Ring发布了一则本应温馨的超级碗广告，展示了其摄像头如何帮助寻找走失的宠物。广告中，Ring应用里一张狗狗的照片会触发户外摄像头进行搜索匹配。然而，广告的反应并非全然正面。批评者认为这项技术过于侵入性，展示了如何将整个社区的摄像头联动起来寻找一只狗。在社交媒体上，人们质疑当局是否能够利用这项技术，潜在地接入成千上万个摄像头来追踪人们的日常行踪。

如今，在对其产品的新一轮审查中，Ring宣布将终止与另一家监控技术公司的合作。这家公司为全国各地的警察部门提供车牌识别器等工具。此次合作本会将Ring的技术与其技术相结合，并在调查期间帮助房主与执法部门共享录像。Ring公司（由亚马逊所有）并未说明终止合作是否是由于超级碗广告的反应，仅表示该合作项目将需要比预期更多的时间和资源。马萨诸塞州参议员埃德·马基（Ed Markey）长期以来一直批评Ring的数据隐私实践，他称此举是“在防范我国不断扩张的监控技术网络方面迈出的重要一步”。

And finally, >> pets are family, but every year 10 million go missing. And >> last week, the home security company Ring put out what was supposed to be a heartwarming Super Bowl ad, showing how its cameras could help find a lost pet. >> One post of a dog's photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match. Search. But the reaction was not all a critics found the tech invasive, showing how a whole neighborhood's worth of cameras linked up to look for the dog. On social media, people asked if authorities would be able to use it, potentially tapping into thousands of cameras to track people's everyday movements. Now, amid that fresh wave of scrutiny of its products, Ring has announced that it's ending a partnership with another surveillance tech firm, one that provides tools like license plate readers to police departments across the country. The partnership would have linked Ring's Tech with theirs and helped homeowners share footage with law enforcement during investigations. Ring, which is owned by Amazon, did not say that the breakup of the deal was because of the Super Bowl reaction, saying only that the partnership would have needed significantly more time and resources than anticipated. Senator Ed Marky of Massachusetts, who has long been critical of Ring's data privacy practices, called it an important step in quote, guarding against the everexpanding network of surveillance technologies in this country.
