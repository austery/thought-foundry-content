### 传统球探模式的局限性

现在，我想请大家想象一下体育界的伟大。你们看到了什么？很可能是勒布朗·詹姆斯、凯特琳·克拉克、萨克万·巴克利、西蒙·拜尔斯、罗纳尔多、梅西这样的运动员。我们往往倾向于认为运动员只来自少数几个国家。所以，如果你们认为世界上最优秀的体育人才都只来自这些地方，我也会理解，但这并非完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I'm going to start by getting you to visualize sporting greatness. And what do you see? It's probably athletes like LeBron James, Caitlin Clark, Saquon Barkley, Simone Biles, Ronaldo, Messi. You see, we tend to think of athletes from quite a small subset of countries. So I'd forgive you for thinking that the best talent in the world just comes from those places. But that's not strictly true.</p>
</details>

因为天赋早在他们取得体育成就之前就已经存在，而要实现他们的潜力，沿途需要发生很多事情。其中一个常被忽视的因素是，他们获得了机会并被看到了。天赋无处不在，而发现天赋可能才是真正的挑战。那么，我们该如何做到这一点呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because talent existed long before their sporting greatness, and many things have to happen along the way for them to realize their potential. Now, one thing that's commonly overlooked is that they got an opportunity and were visible. You see, talent exists everywhere. It's finding the talent that can be the challenge. So how do we do that?</p>
</details>

通常，这依赖于球探。被球探发现是每个年轻运动员的梦想。你看到那个老头坐在看台上，写着笔记，然后你接到电话，他想让你去试训。这对很多人来说都是一个激动人心的幻想。然而，球探的数量是有限的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now typically, that's scouting. It's every young athlete's dream to be scouted. You see the old guy up in the bleachers, he's writing his notes, and later you get the call, he wants you to try out. It's a thrilling fantasy for so many people. There's only so many scouts.</p>
</details>

我来自英国，切尔西足球俱乐部（Chelsea Football Club）拥有世界上最负盛名、资金最雄厚的青年学院项目之一。但每支**英超联赛**（Premier League: 英格兰足球联赛系统的最高级别联赛）球队，或者说每位英超球探，每年大约只能考察2000名球员。然而，有数百万人参与这项运动。即使在这2000人中，也已经受到球员地理位置、成本因素和可及性因素的极大限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I'm from the UK, where Chelsea Football Club have one of the most prestigious and well-funded youth academy programs in the world. But each Premier League team, or each Premier League scout, can only see about 2,000 players per year. But millions play the game. And even from those 2,000, it's already super limited by the player's geography, their cost factors, their access factors.</p>
</details>

现在，许多年轻人开始自己动手。他们将自己精彩表现的社交媒体短片上传到网上。但这只是用一个并非为人才识别而设计的算法，取代了人类来决定谁能被看到。我们该如何解决这个问题？切尔西足球俱乐部根本不可能看到世界上所有的天才。或者，真的可能吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lots of young people are now taking that into their own hands. They're uploading social media clips of their best plays online. But now we've just replaced a human with an algorithm that's not designed for talent ID to decide who gets seen. What do we do about that? It's simply not possible for Chelsea Football Club to see every talent in the world. Or is it?</p>
</details>

### aiScout的诞生：用技术弥合差距

现在，像**计算机视觉AI**（Computer Vision AI: 一种使计算机能够“看”并解释图像和视频的技术）、**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器能力）和**深度学习**（Deep Learning: 机器学习的一个子领域，使用多层神经网络从数据中学习）这样的技术，正在帮助我们弥合这一差距。就我个人而言，我不是球探也不是教练。我的职业是**生物力学**（Biomechanics: 研究生物体运动的力学原理的科学）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You see, there's technologies now like computer vision, AI and deep learning, that are helping us bridge that gap. Now, personally, I'm not a scout or a coach. My route was biomechanics, which is the science of motion.</p>
</details>

像我这个行业的许多人一样，我们在体育实验室或俱乐部工作，职责是提高运动员表现或降低受伤风险。有一天，我在实验室工作时，我的现任创始人兼首席执行官达伦·佩里斯带着他受伤的儿子里夫走了进来。我们用所有这些精密的设备开始分析里夫。我们聊起了球探问题，他指出球探工作是多么不公平和带有偏见。他亲身经历过，一个人的未来可能在一天之内，由一个有主观意见的人决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like many people in my profession, we work in sports laboratories or with clubs with a remit of improving athlete performance or reducing injury risk. And I was working in my lab that one day, my now founder and CEO, Darren Peries, walked in with his son, Reef, who was struggling with an injury, and we started analyzing him with all this wonderful equipment. And we got talking about the scouting problem, and he noted just how unfair and biased scouting could be. He'd seen it himself. Entire futures could be decided in one day by one person who has an opinion.</p>
</details>

他指出青年球探工作是多么缺乏数据支持。他问我，如果我们把所有这些实验室协议、所有数据、所有设备，都整合到一套标准化的智能手机训练中，这样世界上任何地方的任何孩子都能得到公平公正的测试，那会怎么样？对我来说，这是一个针对真实问题的绝妙愿景。所以我加入了他的团队ai.io，我们致力于在所有体育领域构建基于AI的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He noted how completely devoid of data youth scouting can be. And he said to me, what if we took all this lab protocols, all the data, all the equipment, and put them into a set of standardized smartphone drills so any kid, anywhere in the world could be tested fairly and equitably? For me, it was a brilliant vision to a genuine problem. So I joined his team, ai.io, where we build AI-based solutions across all of sport.</p>
</details>

我们构建的第一个产品就是aiScout，用于解决眼前的问题。简单来说，它的工作原理是这样的：孩子免费下载一个应用程序，然后直接通过手机录制自己完成预设训练的视频。我们在云端使用计算机视觉AI来分析这些视频。我们分析22个关键身体部位，甚至可以将2D视频转换为推断出的3D数据，并将所有这些信息整合起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the first thing we built was aiScout for the problem at hand. And here's how it works, simply speaking. Kid downloads an app for free and they record themselves doing these predefined drills directly from the phone. We use computer-vision AI in the cloud to analyze that. We analyze 22 key body segments. We can even do things like turn the 2D video into an inferred 3D and bring all that together.</p>
</details>

我们能获取到他们跑步的方向、转身的方式、跳跃的高度、速度、对称性、协调性等等数据。但收集这些原始数据只是问题的一部分。你还需要知道如何解释这些数据，并且能够根据这些数据对运动员进行评分。最重要的是，你必须针对那些寻找人才的人，使数据具有特异性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We get things like what direction did they run, how did they turn, how high did they jump, the speed, the symmetry, the coordination, and so on. But collecting that raw-level data is just one part of the problem. So you've got to know how to interpret that data, and you've got to be able to score an athlete based on that data. And most importantly, you've got to make it specific for those that are looking for talent.</p>
</details>

特异性在这里是关键。例如，在足球运动中——对于观众中的美国人来说就是“soccer”——每个球队、球探或教练根据他们当时的需求，寻找的东西都有所不同。有些球队或教练可能需要力量和速度兼备的运动员，而另一些则可能需要协调性、技术和出色的身体动作。因此，我们的球探系统必须根据每个俱乐部进行定制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Specificity is key here. For example, in football -- soccer, for the Americans in the audience -- each team or scout or coach kind of look for a different thing depending on what they need at that given moment of time. So some teams or coaches might want athletes with power and pace, others might want coordination and technique and great body movement. So we have to make our scout, we have to be tailored, on that club-by-club basis.</p>
</details>

### 与英超俱乐部的合作：建立信任与基准

为了回答这些问题并真正开发出这款产品，我们与两支英超球队——伯恩利足球俱乐部（Burnley Football Club）和切尔西足球俱乐部（Chelsea Football Club）——进行了合作。我们首先直接问他们，如果我们能通过智能手机分析世界上任何一个孩子，并提供足球特有的指标，他们需要知道什么才能让这些数据对他们有用并加以利用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now to answer these questions and really to build out that product, we partner with two Premier League teams, Burnley Football Club and Chelsea Football Club. And we started by just asking them directly, if we could analyze any kid in the world, from a smartphone and give you football-specific metrics, what do you need to know to make that relevant to you and to use it?</p>
</details>

有趣的是，他们说需要可比较、可基准化、可靠的数据。最重要的是，无论是他们自己还是他们将要分析的孩子，都需要明白数据的来源。不能有任何歧义。所以我们开始与他们一起开发这些预设训练。这些训练包括十米冲刺、**反向运动跳跃**（Counter-movement jumps: 一种常见的跳跃测试，通过快速下蹲再立即向上跳起，测量爆发力）、带球绕锥、传球、射门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And interestingly, they said, comparable, benchmarkable, reliable data. And above all else, both themselves and the kids they'd be analyzing, would need to understand where the data is coming from. There can be no ambiguity. So we started developing these predefined drills with them. They were ten-meter sprints, counter-movement jumps, they were dribbling through cones, they were passing, shooting.</p>
</details>

这都不是什么新鲜事。这些都是球探通常会用来评估球员的真实项目。然后我们和那些球探坐下来，查看了大量的视频。你们更喜欢球员A还是球员B？结果发现，球探的艺术实际上极其复杂。许多经验丰富的球探所做的事情都是非常直观的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is nothing new. This was just genuine things that scouts would normally look at to make an assessment of a player. And then we sat down with those scouts and looked through a ton of video. Do you prefer player A or player B? Now it turns out the art of scouting is actually incredibly complex. So much of what experienced scout does is really intuitive.</p>
</details>

所以，尽管他们知道自己更喜欢球员B，也许我们大多数人看着视频也能看出来，但他们无法向我们清楚地表达原因。因此，我们必须和他们坐在一起，提问，并将他们的洞察力转化为我们可以用来评分的东西。我们创建了算法。然后，我们通过这个算法处理了数千个视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So whilst they knew they preferred player B, and maybe most of us can, looking at the video here, but they couldn't articulate it to us. So we had to sit with them, ask the questions, and turn their insights into something we could use to score. We created the algorithm. And with that algorithm, we just pumped thousands of videos through it.</p>
</details>

我们开始建立跨年龄和性别的基准和标准。因为当然，你不能用分析13岁孩子的方式去分析22岁的人。22岁的人几乎总是更高、更强壮、更快。你需要将13岁的孩子与13岁的孩子进行比较，这样你才能真正看到谁脱颖而出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we started to make benchmarks and standards across age and gender. Because of course, you can't analyze a 13-year-old to a 22-year-old. The 22-year-old is almost always going to be bigger, stronger, faster. You need to compare 13-year-olds to 13-year-olds so you can really see who stands out.</p>
</details>

### 早期成功与全球推广

说到脱颖而出，我永远不会忘记，当我们第一次开发这个应用程序时，我们招募了50名来自英国的大学生。老实说，他们都是普通的足球运动员，除了一个人，本。他们都完成了我们的训练，而他鹤立鸡群，表现非常非常出色。他当时17岁。这个人以前怎么会没有被球探发现呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And talking of standing out, I'll never forget, when we were first developing the app, we recruited 50 college kids from the UK. They were, honestly, kind of average footballers, except this one guy, Ben. They all did our drills and he was head and shoulders above the rest. Like, just really, really good. Like, he was 17. How has this guy not been scouted before?</p>
</details>

最疯狂的是，他家离切尔西足球俱乐部的训练场只有几分钟的路程。他不是住在某个偏远的村庄。他就在世界上最好的青训学院之一的附近。系统没有发现他，但我们发现了。长话短说，这就是我们知道我们正在构建的东西是有效的时刻。因为他获得了切尔西足球俱乐部的试训机会，在U18首秀中进球，后来签约了另一家英超俱乐部，甚至代表国家队出战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the crazy thing is, he lived just minutes down the road from Chelsea FC training ground. He wasn't in some remote village. He was literally down the road from one of the world's best academies. The system didn't see him, but we did. I'll cut a long story short here, but this is where we knew what we were building was working. Because he got a trial for Chelsea Football Club, scored in his under-18 debut, and he later signed for another Premier League club and even represented his country.</p>
</details>

但这还不够。我们需要在那些偏远地区测试它。这应该是为所有人服务的。理论上，因为所有的繁重工作都在云端完成——视频分析、处理、评分、建模——这意味着无论你来自伦敦还是孟买，只要能使用智能手机，这个系统就能运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that wasn't enough. We needed to test this in those remote places. This should be for everyone. Now, theoretically, because all the heavy lifting is done in the cloud, the analysis of the video, the processing, the scoring, the modeling, it means that whether you're from London or Mumbai, if you've got access to a smartphone, this thing can work.</p>
</details>

我们很幸运能与印度的信实基金会（Reliance Foundation）合作。他们有一个很棒的项目，每年都会派出球探去寻找最优秀的11岁天才，为他们提供五年的体育奖学金和免费教育。其中最优秀的孩子通常会继续在印度从事职业体育。他们面临着和切尔西一样的问题：少数球探只能看到几千人，而符合条件的可能有数百万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're lucky to partner with Reliance Foundation in India. They have an amazing program where they send scouts out every single year to find the best 11-year-old talent to give them five-year scholarships to play sport and have free education. With the best of those generally going on to play professional sport in India. Same problem as Chelsea. Few scouts can see a few thousand people; potentially millions that are eligible.</p>
</details>

所以他们求助于我们，试图找到那些在偏远地区难以接触到的孩子。他们在WhatsApp上向他们的受众发出了号召。通过WhatsApp做这件事对我们来说是新鲜事，但家长和学生被要求下载应用程序，在手机里完成训练，并直接通过aiScout为信实基金会进行试训。现在每年有数万名孩子这样做。根据他们的数据，表现最好的孩子会被送到一个现场人才识别日，由球探决定谁能获得这些奖学金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they turned to us to try and find some of those hard-to-reach kids in difficult locations. And they put out a call on WhatsApp to their audience. New to us to do this on WhatsApp, but the parents and students were asked to download an app and do the drills inside the phone and trial for Reliance Foundation directly from aiScout. Tens of thousands of kids now do this every single year. And the best ones, based on their data, get sent to an in-person talent ID day where the scouts make the decision on who gets those scholarships.</p>
</details>

这是一个很好的例子，说明我们是如何增强球探流程，而不仅仅是取代他们的流程。最成功的例子是，我们有很多这样的例子，其中一名球员通过一个社区共享手机下载了应用程序，他从未参加过有组织的体育活动，却为自己赢得了一份五年奖学金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a great example of how we're augmenting the scouting process, not just replacing their processes. The best example of success was, we've had many there, is one player actually downloaded the app from a shared community phone, had never played organized sport, and got himself a five-year scholarship.</p>
</details>

除此之外，就在去年，国际奥委会（IOC）及其当时的合作伙伴英特尔（Intel）联系了我们，谈及即将到来的塞内加尔青年奥运会。他们有点担心塞内加尔国家队没有足够的人才来填补青年奥运会的所有参赛队伍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, only last year, the IOC and their partner at the time, Intel, they reached out to us about the up-and-coming Youth Olympics, which is in Senegal. They had a little concern that actually the Senegalese national teams didn't have enough talent to fill all the teams that are going to be in those Youth Olympics.</p>
</details>

这项技术最棒的地方在于：你想踢足球吗？你可以通过我们的应用程序为足球俱乐部试训。你也可以反其道而行之。根据你的优势，它可以告诉你可能擅长什么。如果你有出色的加速能力和反应力量，那可能是七人制橄榄球或室内五人制足球。如果你有出色的上肢力量和手眼协调能力，那可能是棒球或垒球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here's the great thing about the technology. You want to play football? You can trial for a football club through our app. You can also do the opposite. Based on your strengths, it can tell you what you might be good at. So if you've got great acceleration, great reactive strength, it could be rugby sevens or futsal. You've got great upper body power and hand-eye coordination. It could be a baseball or a softball.</p>
</details>

这正是我们所做的。我们将应用程序安装到平板电脑中，交给军事领导人和学校教师，他们就站在那里录制班级里的孩子。几天后，数千名孩子参与其中，现在有40名孩子正在为青年奥运会进行摔跤、田径和足球等项目的训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's exactly what we did. We put the app into tablets, we gave it to military leaders and school teachers, and they just stood there and they recorded the kids in their class. A few days into that, thousands of kids later, 40 are now being trained ahead of those Youth Olympics in things like wrestling and athletics and football.</p>
</details>

### 未来展望：全球化与跨领域应用

那么，接下来会走向何方？如今，这个应用程序通过合作项目、人才识别计划，与俱乐部、联合会合作运行，有时应用程序上还有品牌合作伙伴，成千上万的孩子通过它进行试训和训练。其中数百人取得了成功，现在正在从事职业体育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, where does this go from here? So the app today runs through partnership programs, talent ID initiatives, with clubs, with federations, sometimes there are brand partners on the app, where hundreds of thousands of kids trial and do these drills. Hundreds of those have had successful outcomes and now playing professional sport.</p>
</details>

我们接下来会走向何方？实际上，我们将把这项技术推向全球，对吧？所以它现在是多语言的，并开始在应用程序中推出。多云支持也即将到来。这意味着它可以是云无关的，我们可以在任何需要合作的地区，将特定国家的功能放入应用程序中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And where do we go from here? Actually we go global with this, right? So it's now multi-language, it's starting to roll out into the app. Multi-cloud is coming. So it can be cloud-agnostic, which means we can put country-specific things into the app in any region that we need to work with.</p>
</details>

就在美国，我们很自豪地宣布，**MLS**（Major League Soccer: 美国职业足球大联盟）——我们在这里称之为大联盟足球——已经将这项技术推广到**MLS NEXT**（MLS NEXT: 美国职业足球大联盟（MLS）的青年发展项目，旨在培养下一代足球人才）项目中。现在有45,000名孩子每年使用这个应用程序三次：季前、季中、季后，这样我们就可以追踪和监测他们随时间的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And right here, in the US, proud to announce the MLS, or Major League Soccer as we know it here, have rolled this out to the MLS NEXT program. 45,000 kids right now are using the app three times per year. Preseason, mid-season, postseason so we can track and monitor their changes over time.</p>
</details>

最棒的是，球探和教练可以通过我们的控制中心实时获取所有数据。它不是一个黑盒子，而是一个他们可以信任并从数据中学习、了解数据来源的工具。我们还会走向何方？对大家来说，想象我们如何开始进入家庭医疗和医学等领域，可能并不是一个很大的飞跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the great thing is, the scouts and the coaches get all the data in real time via our control center. It's not a black box, but something they can trust and learn from the data and see where that data is coming from. And where else do we go? It's probably not a big leap for you all to imagine how we start to move into things like at-home healthcare and medical.</p>
</details>

但我们也在开始为美式橄榄球、篮球、棒球、板球等运动创建运动库。因为底层的运动原语，比如切入、减速、跳跃、投掷、击打，它们在很多运动中都很好地通用。因为在体育运动中，有一件事永远是真的：天赋是普遍存在的，才华遍布全球的每一个角落。现在，有了科技和你们自己的智能手机，你们可以使这些天赋显现，并创造一个公平的竞争环境。谢谢大家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we're also starting to create the kind of movement libraries for American football, for basketball, for baseball, for cricket. Because the underlying movement primitives, the cut, the deceleration, the jump, the throw, the strike, they translate well across quite a lot of sports. Because one thing in sport is always true. Talent is universal and brilliance exists in every corner of the globe. Now, with technology and your very own smartphone, you can make that talent visible and level the playing field. Thank you. (Applause)</p>
