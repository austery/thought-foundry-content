### 佐兰·曼达尼在纽约市长选举中获胜

在纽约市，佐兰·曼达尼（Zoran Mandani）昨晚以惊人的政治崛起画上句号，赢得了市长选举，当地选民投票率达到1960年代以来的最高水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In New York City, Zoran Mandani capped off a stunning political rise last night, winning the mayoral election with voter turnout there, the highest it's been since the 1960s.</p>
</details>

纽约，今晚你们带来了变革的授权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change.</p>
</details>

这是一个关于我们能负担得起的城市，以及一个能真正实现这一目标的政府的授权。曼达尼明年宣誓就职时，将以34岁的年龄成为纽约一个多世纪以来最年轻的市长，同时也是第一位穆斯林、第一位南亚裔，以及美国最大城市有史以来第二位**民主社会主义者**（Democratic Socialist: 一种主张通过民主手段实现社会主义目标的政治意识形态）市长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A mandate for a city we can afford and a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that. When Mandani is sworn in next year, he'll become New York's youngest mayor in more than a century at 34 years old, as well as the first Muslim, first South Asian, and only the second ever Democratic socialist to run America's largest city.</p>
</details>

曼达尼的胜利对**进步派**（Progressives: 政治上主张社会改革和进步的群体）来说是一次巨大的胜利。他代表了民主党的左翼，与众议员亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯（Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez）和伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）是亲密盟友。现在，曼达尼已成为美国最杰出的进步派之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mdani's victory is a huge win for progressives. He represents the left wing of the Democratic party. He's close allies with Representative Alexandria Okasiocortez and Bernie Sanders. And now Manny is one of the most prominent progressives in the country.</p>
</details>

《泰晤士报》市政厅分社社长艾玛·菲茨西蒙斯（Emma FitzSimmons）表示，曼达尼的崛起是“流星般”的。在竞选开始时，他几乎是一位默默无闻的州议员。在初选前，他是一个如此不被看好的候选人，甚至没有准备胜选演讲。但在过去一年里，他擅长社交媒体的竞选活动使他成为全国性人物，他雄心勃勃的施政纲领也激发了广大纽约市民的热情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Emma Fitz Simmons is the Times city hall bureau chief. She says Mandani's rise has been meteoric. At the start of the race, he was a virtually unknown state assemblyman. Ahead of the primary, he was such a longshot candidate, he didn't even prepare a victory speech. But over the last year, his social media savvy campaign turned him into a national figure and his ambitious platform electrified a broad range of New Yorkers.</p>
</details>

曼达尼与年轻选民和移民建立了联系。他以“可负担性”为竞选口号，承诺通过免费公交、冻结**租金管制公寓**（Rent-stabilized apartments: 受政府法规限制租金涨幅的公寓）的租金，以及实施全民育儿服务，使纽约市变得更加宜居。但现在，最艰难的部分开始了：管理一个拥有800万人口的城市。他将面临诸多挑战，既要运营一个复杂的城市，又要努力兑现他对选民的承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Manny connected with younger voters and immigrants. He ran on this message of affordability, that he was going to make the city more affordable by making buses free, by freezing the rents on rentstabilized apartments, and by implementing universal child care. But now the hard part begins. running a city of 8 million people. He's going to face a lot of challenges running a complex city and trying to make progress that he has promised to voters.</p>

### 民主党在全国范围内取得胜利，特朗普遭遇挫折

与此同时，昨晚全国各地的民主党候选人赢得了多项选举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, Democrats up and down the ballot won elections across the country last night.</p>
</details>

这是一场艰难的战斗，也是艰难的一天，但我知道你们是新泽西人。我们爱你们，我也爱你们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was a tough fight and this was a tough day, but I know you're New Jersey. We love you and I love you.</p>
</details>

在新泽西州，迈基·谢里尔（Mikey Cheryl）以较大优势赢得了州长席位。在弗吉尼亚州，阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格（Abigail Spanberger）通过她的胜利扭转了州长席位的控制权，我们选择了我们的联邦而不是混乱。两位候选人都击败了唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统支持的共和党挑战者，这显然是对特朗普上任第一年激进政策的一种反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In New Jersey, Mikey Cheryl won the governor's seat by a wide margin. And in Virginia, we chose our Commonwealth over chaos. Abigail Spanberger flipped control of the governor's seat with her win. Both candidates beat out Republican challengers who President Trump had endorsed, an apparent rebuke of Trump's aggressive first year in office.</p>
</details>

在加利福尼亚州，选民们批准了一项旨在重新划分该州国会选区地图以有利于民主党的措施，这也被视为对总统的反击。在特朗普推动共和党在红州也采取同样做法的几个月后，民主党在一些小型选举中也取得了胜利。宾夕法尼亚州的选民选择维持州最高法院的民主党多数席位。在佐治亚州，民主党在州公用事业委员会中翻转了几个席位，这是被视为明年中期选举**风向标**（Bellwether: 预示未来趋势的指标）的几场选举之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In what was also seen as backlash to the president, voters in California approved a measure to redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Democrats. After months of Trump pushing the GOP to do the same in red states, Democrats also notched victories in smaller races. Pennsylvania voters chose to keep the Democratic majority on the state supreme court. And in Georgia, Democrats flipped several seats on the state's utility board, one of several races seen as a bellweather for the midterms next year.</p>
</details>

### 政府停摆与政治僵局

截至午夜，政府停摆已正式成为美国历史上最长的停摆，持续了整整35天，并且还在继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As of midnight, the government shutdown is now officially the longest shutdown in American history, stretching on for 35 full days and counting.</p>
</details>

共和党人需要明白，家庭不会忘记这一切，因为他们每个月都将为巨额医疗费用上涨付出代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Republicans need to get it into their head. Families are not going to forget this because they are going to be paying the cost of the mega healthc care hike every single month.</p>
</details>

民主党人仍然表示，除非共和党人达成协议，为数百万美国人延长医疗补贴，否则他们不会投票重新开放政府。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Democrats still say they won't vote to reopen the government unless Republicans strike a deal to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.</p>
</details>

民主党人完全偏离了轨道。我们只需要五名民主党参议员将国家利益置于党派之上，投票结束这次鲁莽的停摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Democrats have completely lost the plot. All we need are five Democrat senators to put country over party and vote to end this reckless shutdown.</p>
</details>

共和党人表示，除非民主党人帮助他们通过一项短期支出法案并使政府恢复运作，否则他们不会就任何事情进行谈判。在上次政府资金出现重大缺口期间，即特朗普总统第一个任期内，特朗普曾试图通过谈判解决问题。但这一次，总统采取了更强硬的立场，推动联邦工作人员裁员并削减对民主党州份的资金。现在，他和他的政府正在加剧这些威胁。他昨天暗示，他可能会违抗法院命令，并扣留对超过4000万美国人的**食品券支付**（Food stamp payments: 美国政府为低收入家庭提供的食品援助计划），白宫后来撤回了这一威胁。政府仍在考虑不向那些被强制休假但依法有权获得工资的联邦工作人员支付补发工资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Republicans say they won't negotiate on anything until Democrats help them pass a short-term spending bill and get the government back up and running. During the last major lapse in government funding, which happened in President Trump's first term, Trump got involved in trying to negotiate a way out. But this time around, the president has taken a more aggressive stance by pushing for layoffs of federal workers and funding cuts to Democratic states. Now, he and his administration are only ramping up those kinds of threats. He suggested yesterday that he might defy a court order and withhold food stamp payments to over 40 million Americans, a threat the White House later walked back. And the administration is still floating not giving back pay to furlowed federal workers who've gone without paychecks, even though they're legally entitled to that money.</p>

### 肯塔基州货运飞机坠毁事故

任何看过图像和视频的人都知道这次坠机有多么猛烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anybody who has seen the images and the video uh know how violent this crash is.</p>
</details>

昨晚在肯塔基州路易斯维尔，一架UPS货运飞机在跑道上滑行时似乎起火，短暂起飞后，在机场外不远处坠毁并爆炸成一个巨大的火球。目前，我们认为主要受影响区域包括两家企业。看起来它们受到了相当直接的撞击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In Louisville, Kentucky last night, a UPS cargo plane appeared to catch fire as it traveled down the runway, taking off briefly before it crashed and exploded in an enormous fireball just outside the airport. Right now, we believe that the main area hit consisted of two businesses. It looks like they were hit uh pretty directly.</p>
</details>

坠机事故造成至少七人死亡，11人受伤。该市市长表示，四名遇难者是地面人员。一名目击者告诉《泰晤士报》，他听到多次爆炸声，当时这架载有近4万加仑航空燃油的飞机撞上了跑道附近的工业区，他还看到人们从火焰和残骸中逃离。此次坠机暂时中断了UPS在该机场的运营，该机场是美国最大的航空货运枢纽之一。每天，超过300架UPS航班载运约200万个包裹进出路易斯维尔。国家运输安全委员会（National Transportation Safety Board）表示，其调查团队将于今天抵达现场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At least seven people were killed and 11 were injured in the crash. The city's mayor said four of the fatalities were people on the ground. An eyewitness told the Times that he heard multiple explosions as the plane, which was loaded with almost 40,000 gallons of jet fuel, hit the industrial area near the runway, and that he saw people run away from the flames and the wreckage. The crash temporarily disrupted UPS's operations at the airport, which is one of the largest air cargo hubs in the country. Every day, more than 300 UPS flights carrying about 2 million packages go in and out of Louisville. The National Transportation Safety Board says its team of investigators will arrive on the scene today.</p>

### 以色列巴勒斯坦被拘留者受虐案争议

在以色列，一起涉及加沙一名巴勒斯坦被拘留者涉嫌受虐的案件再次引发了全国性争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In Israel, a case involving the alleged abuse of a Palestinian detainee from Gaza has reignited a national controversy.</p>
</details>

去年，一群以色列士兵被指控在军事监狱中袭击该男子，包括打断他的肋骨、刺穿他的肺部和撕裂他的直肠。该设施有长期以来被指控虐待被拘留者的历史，数千名加沙居民曾被关押在那里。事件发生后不久，监控录像被泄露。由于士兵们大多将自己和被拘留者藏在摄像机视线之外，因此录像未能清晰地显示发生了什么。尽管如此，录像片段显示他们围住了被按在墙上的男子，后来他躺在地上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year, a group of Israeli soldiers were accused of assaulting the man at a military jail, including breaking his ribs, puncturing a lung, and tearing his rectum. There's a long history of abuse allegations at that facility where thousands of gazins have been held. Surveillance footage of the incident was leaked shortly after. It didn't offer a clear view of what happened since the soldiers mostly hid themselves and the detainee from the cameras. Still, excerpts of the footage showed them surrounding the man as he was pinned against a wall and later him lying on the ground.</p>
</details>

士兵被拘留后，一些右翼以色列人举行抗议，称士兵在羁押期间虐待巴勒斯坦人应基本免受起诉。该案件现在再次成为新闻焦点，因为以色列军方的首席法律官员上周承认是她泄露了这段录像。她在辞职信中为这一决定辩护，称她这样做是为了让人们看到调查是合法的。她写道，即使在战争期间，也有义务调查虐待行为。她补充说，“不幸的是，这种基本理解，即有些行为绝不能做，即使是对最卑劣的被拘留者，也不再能说服所有人。”本周，她因涉嫌渎职和妨碍司法而被捕。被控虐待的士兵的律师现在表示，他们的案件应该被撤销，理由是她通过泄露录像玷污了法律程序。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After the soldiers were detained, some right-wing Israelis protested, saying that soldiers should be largely immune from prosecution for mistreating Palestinians in custody. The case is back in the news now because the Israeli military's chief legal officer admitted last week that she was the one who leaked the footage. She defended that decision in a resignation letter, saying she'd done it so people could see the investigation was legitimate. She wrote that even during war, there is an obligation to investigate abuse. She added, quote, "Unfortunately, this basic understanding that there are actions which must never be taken, even against the vilest of detainees, no longer convinces everyone." This week, she was arrested on suspicion of misconduct and obstructing justice. Lawyers for the soldiers who've been charged with abuse now say their case should be dropped, arguing she sullied the legal process by leaking the tape.</p>
</details>

### 阿拉斯加台风与考古遗址

最后，在阿拉斯加，一场台风的残余上个月袭击了该州，一夜之间侵蚀了多达60英尺的海岸线。这场罕见的风暴袭击的地点之一是海岸线上的一个考古发掘现场，研究人员一直在那里挖掘当地**尤皮克人**（Yupic people: 阿拉斯加和俄罗斯远东地区的原住民群体）祖先留下的文物。其中一些物品已有600年历史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally, in Alaska, the remnants of a typhoon hit the state last month, carving away as much as 60 ft of coastal land overnight. One of the things the rare storm hit was an archaeological dig site on the shoreline where researchers had been excavating artifacts left behind by the ancestors of the Yupic people there. Some of the objects were up to 600 years old.</p>
</details>

自风暴以来，人们一直在争分夺秒地回收被冲走的物品，包括木制公牛、玩偶、雕刻品和箭杆。一些当地人发现它们再次被冲上沙滩。你以为你捡到的是浮木，但实际上它可能是一个无价的面具。一位考古学家估计，可能仍有1万件文物散落在外面，人们一直在成箱地从水中打捞它们。对许多人来说，在气候变化正在改变北极的当下，发现和保护这段历史显得尤为紧迫。那里的冻土过去能保存物品数百年。但现在，被称为**永久冻土**（Permafrost: 长期处于冰冻状态的土壤）的土壤融化已导致一些埋藏的物品开始分解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ever since the storm, there's been a race to recover the items that got washed away. Wooden bulls, dolls, carvings, arrow shafts. Some of the locals have found them washing up again on the beach. You think you're picking up driftwood, but it's actually a priceless mask. One archaeologist estimates there are likely 10,000 artifacts still out there, and people have been rescuing them from the water by the box full. For many, finding and preserving that history feels particularly urgent now as climate change transforms the Arctic. The frozen ground there used to preserve objects for centuries. But now the thaw of the soil known as perafrost has caused some buried objects to begin decomposing.</p>
</details>

令人意想不到的是，摧毁发掘现场的同一场风暴也可能帮助发现了新的文物。就在几英里外，一座旧房子的木梁现在正从被风暴撕裂的永久冻土中显露出来。那个遗址可能比被冲走的发掘现场还要古老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In a twist, the same storm that destroyed the dig site also may have helped expose new finds. Just a few miles away, the wooden beams of an old house are now peeking through the storm shredded perafrost. That site is possibly even older than what was washed away at the dig.</p>
</details>
