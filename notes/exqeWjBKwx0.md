### 欺诈与金融周期

**发言人**: 欺诈行为具有周期性，对吧？因为在经济繁荣时期，人们往往会视而不见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: There is a cyclical element to fraud, right? Because in good times people will look the other way.

</details>

**发言人**: 我不认为它是周期性的，我认为它一直都在。我只是觉得，谁说的来着，“当潮水退去时，你就能知道谁在裸泳。”我想是**巴菲特**说的。是的，是的。然而，**加尔布雷斯**谈到了“欺诈泡沫”（the bezzle）。对，在经济繁荣时期，欺诈和骗局往往更容易滋生，人们对此熟视无睹，然后这些问题不断积累。但这可能就是我们已经经历了20年的原因，就像你说的，我们没有经历过信贷危机。我的意思是，自金融危机以来，现在已经差不多20年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And I don't I don't think it's cyclical. I think it's always there. I just think, you know, the who's that said it, you know, when the when the water goes out you can figure out is swimming nude. I think it was buffet. Buffet. Yeah. Yeah. Well Galbraith's however talked about the bezzle. Right. The, the the propensity of flimflam and scams to exist during the good times and people just like, and that accumulates and accumulates. But that could be. We've had like 20 years, as you said, like we haven't had a credit. I mean, we're it's almost 20 years since the financial crisis now.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，金融总能找到办法自我引爆。我的意思是，这并非个人观点，看看历史就知道了。我认为发生的情况是，我们找到了好东西，然后就一直利用它们。在每一次出现问题的情况下，你都会不断地推动某件事，直到它超越极限。对吧？金融业是一个历史上可以赚很多钱的行业，对吧？你在玩别人的钱，从别人的钱里赚取一分一厘。我只会不断地推动，不断地推动。当它最终崩溃时，就会彻底崩盘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. The finance always finds its way, finds a way to blow itself up. I mean, it's it's yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's it's not an opinion. And just look at history. I think what happens is you get you get, you know, we find good things and then you ride them and you. Yeah. In every instance where something's gone wrong, you just keep pushing on something till you take it over the edge. Right. Finances. An industry where historically you could make a lot of money at it. Right? You're playing with other people's money, you know, pennies and nickels coming off of other people's money. I'm just going to keep pushing. I'm going to keep pushing and keep pushing. When it finally falls, it falls hard.

### 银行业的规模优势

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听Odd Lots播客的又一期节目。我是**Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Alloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy，我想我们最近一些节目的主题之一，也是我们这个时代的大趋势之一，就是**规模**是一种竞争优势。规模带来回报，规模效应带来回报。某人拿起电话说“我现在需要很多钱”的能力，以及金融机构因此获得的优势，我们看到它存在于许多行业。但在我们的金融对话中，它确实非常突出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So Tracy, one of the motifs, I guess, of some of our recent. Motif is a. Good word. It's a good word, isn't it? Thank you. One of the motifs of some of our recent conversations, and also, I guess one of the megatrends of our time is this idea of just like scale is a competitive advantage. Size returns to size, returns to scale. The ability of someone to, like pick up a phone and say, I need a lot of money right now. And the advantage that accrues to financial players is we see it across a lot of sectors. But it really it stands out a lot in our finance conversations.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 在商业中做大感觉很好，对吧？一旦你做大了，你就会拥有所有这些竞争优势，让你变得更大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It feels good to be big in business, right? Like once you get big, you have all this competitive advantage that allows you to get bigger.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我认为最明显的地方，而且已经持续了一段时间，就是银行业，对吧？美国银行业的长期趋势是强者恒强。我们都见过那些图表，显示构成**美国银行**或**摩根大通**的所有小银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: The place where this is most noticeable, I would argue, and it's been this way for a while, is the banking industry right? Like the long run trend among U.S. banks is the big get bigger. And we've all seen those charts of like all the little banks that compose Bank of America or JP Morgan.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我喜欢那些图表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I love those charts.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我也喜欢。这似乎是行业发展的方向，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I do too. And that's the direction the industry seems to be heading, right?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Right.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我觉得很有趣的是，把它类比成科技行业，因为科技行业也是如此，对吧？如果你看看大型科技公司，我们谈论**七巨头**等等，它们的表现确实超越了中小型科技公司。这真是令人难以置信。我们对网络效应、锁定效应等有直观的理解。但令人着迷的是，我们讲述的一些故事可能有点不足，因为我们看到同样的故事在银行领域重演。对于银行来说，这似乎有几个方面：一是**资产负债表容量**，以及进行大额交易的能力等等。当然，还有另一方面，就是你可以提供的服务菜单，对吧？如果你是一家大银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It's so interesting to me to like to think about, like, these are an analog to tech because it's the same in tech, right? If you look at big tech and we talk about the mag seven, etc., they've really outperformed middle tech or small tech. It is truly incredible. And we have intuitive reasons for understanding of that network effects lock and and so forth. And it's so fascinating that some of our story that we tell must be a little bit insufficient, because we see the same story replicated as, as we're talking about, with banks and with banks, it seems to be a couple of fold as like one is balance sheet capacity, right? And the ability to do big deals and so forth. And then of course, there's the other thing, which is just like the sort of the menu of services that you can offer, right? If you're a big bank.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 对。而且你拥有资产负债表，你有很多钱。所以如果出现一笔大交易，你可以很快地部署资金，并且在发行方面获得优先权，这在最近的信贷市场表现良好。所以我们没有做太多纯粹的银行业节目，虽然我们做过一些。但我们可能是在**硅谷银行**事件之后做的最多。我们讨论了社区银行或小型区域银行面临的挑战等等，然后我们知道像**摩根大通**这样的大银行的巨大规模。但那些规模介于**摩根大通**和超级区域银行之间的银行呢？它们有自己有趣的视角。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Right. And also just the fact that you have, well, balance sheet, you have a lot of money. So for juicy deal comes up, you can deploy it quite quickly and you get like first dibs on issuance, which has been good in the recent credit market. So we haven't done like a ton of pure banking episodes or the we've done some. But, you know, we did the most probably right in the wake of, Silicon Valley Bank, obviously. And we talked about like, the challenges of some of the community banks or the sort of smaller regional banks, etc., and then we know, like the huge scale of, like the JP morgan's of the world, but also like, what about the banks? And just sort of like some JP Morgan scale, not. Super regionals, I believe they're called. Super regionals. Interesting perspectives of their own.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我一直说我喜欢和银行家交谈，那些了解银行业运作方式的人。他们通常是我们最有趣的嘉宾。顺便问一下，你有没有看过**KBW银行指数**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And so and I've always said I love talking to bankers, people who understand how banking works just like they're I think they're usually at some of our, our most interesting guests. Have you looked at the, KBW Bank index, by the way?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 今天没有，实际上好几天没看了。或者说，不是好几天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Not today, actually, not in a few days. Or maybe not a few days. Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 它最近表现如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What has it been doing?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 它涨了很多。事实上，我认为在过去12个月里，它的表现超过了**标普500指数**。这在一定程度上说明了人们对银行和银行监管的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It's up quite a lot. In fact, I think over the past 12 months it's outperformed the S&P 500. So that kind of tells you how people feel about banks and bank regulation.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 绝对是这样。**特朗普**上任时，其中一件事就是“放松管制交易”。那是一个因素。可以说，在金融领域，总的来说，虽然10%的信用卡现金返还不像是放松管制，但我会说这是华尔街的预期在很大程度上被本届政府满足的领域之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Absolutely. Right. One of the things when Trump won was the sort of like the deregulation trade. And that was one element. And arguably I would say in finance, by and large, though, 10% credit card cash does not scream deregulation. I would say that's one of the areas in which the expectations of Wall Street have actually been met, by and large, by this administration.

</details>

### PNC的银行定位与战略

**Joe Weisenthal**: 无论如何，我非常高兴地说，我们确实请到了最完美的嘉宾来谈论2026年的银行业。我们将与**PNC金融**的CEO **Bill Demchak**对话，PNC是美国第六大银行，我想它应该是一家超级区域银行。Bill，非常感谢您来到Odd Lots。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Anyway, I'm very excited to say we really do have the perfect guest to talk about the banking world in 2026. We're going to be speaking with Bill Demchak, CEO of PNC financial, which is the sixth biggest bank in the country, I guess a super regional. So, Bill, thank you so much for coming on of late.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 很高兴来到这里，但我得纠正一下。我们是一家全国性银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: It's it's great to be here, but I'm going to correct. Oh, we're a national bank.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 全国性银行。是的。我为什么说超级区域银行呢？你以前是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: National bank. Yeah. Why did I say super regional didn't. Were you once that.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 因为我们有大型银行，人们不知道该怎么称呼我们这样的银行，但是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: You know, because we have the mega banks and people don't know what to call somebody like us, but yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我一直以为超级区域银行就是大型银行下面的那个类别。但我的意思是，区域银行是在某个区域内运营的银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I always thought super regional was just like that category below the mega. But I mean, a regional bank is a bank that operates in a region.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 好的，我们遍布全国最大的大都会区。我们在每个州都有业务。所以我们只是**摩根大通**规模的六分之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Okay, we're. Across the country in the largest MSAs. We're in every state. We. So we're just, you know, one sixth the size of a JPMorgan.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Got it.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 但我们仍然是全国性银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: But we're still a national bank.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 太棒了。既然我们正处于纠正对话记录的阶段，我当然很熟悉**PNC**这个品牌。你会在其他地方看到它，可能在某个体育场或其他地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Excellent. Well, since we're just in the center of the correcting the record phase of the conversation, I'm certainly familiar with the PNC brand. You see it on things elsewhere, probably like a stadium somewhere or some other stadium somewhere.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我们有**海盗队**的**PNC公园**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: We have PNC Park for the Pirates, PNC Park.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好了。那您能给我们一个大致的介绍吗？**PNC金融**是做什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So there you go. But why don't you just give us the big overview? Like, what is PNC financial?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我们是一家传统银行。我们以前称之为“主街银行”（Main Street Bank）。也许这个称呼合适，也许不合适。但我们帮助人们储蓄，我们放贷，我们进行投资，我们通过支付转移资金。我们是一家致力于在全美范围内拥有零售业务的银行，因为美国的零售份额正在整合。我们的优势在于较大的中型市场和较小的企业客户。当然，我们也做商业银行和企业银行。我们在资本市场活跃于几乎所有产品，除了新的股权发行。但我们更像一家传统银行。所以当你谈论规模，以及你最初提到的**摩根大通**时，他们必须在50个国家开展业务。他们在传统银行业务之外还有多个业务线。我们在我们想做的事情上有规模。所以，规模在于你选择攻击的领域，而不是仅仅衡量资产负债表的规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: We are a traditional bank. We used to call it Main Street Bank. Maybe that fits. Maybe it doesn't. But, you know, we help people save. We lend money, we do investments, we move money through payments. We're a bank that aspires to be, you know, coast to coast with, with a retail presence, as retail share consolidates in the US. You know, our sweet spot is larger middle market, smaller, large corporate. But of course, we do commercial and and business banking. We're active in the capital markets across basically every product. But new new equity issuance. But more of a traditional bank. So when you talk about you were talking about scale and your initial thing at JP Morgan, they've got to be in 50 countries. You know, they're in multiple lines of business beyond traditional banking. We have scale and what we want to do. So there's scale and the things you choose to attack, versus scale, just measuring balance sheet size.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 明白了。但你们一直在增长。你们最近进行了一次收购。**First Bank**的目标是成为像那些全国性巨头一样的银行吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Got it. You have been growing, though. You made an acquisition recently. First Bank is the ambition to be, you know, as big as some of the, the G sibs, like the nationally, the national giants, let's say.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我们的目标不是规模，而是**保持相关性**。美国市场的一个背景是，自州际银行法取消以来，银行业的零售份额一直在整合。这种整合仍在加速，大型银行在很大程度上以牺牲小型银行为代价而获胜。因此，在不久的将来，我预计将有五到六家机构控制美国的零售银行业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: The ambition isn't about size. The ambition is about being relevant. So one of the things going on backdrop to the US market in particular, is there has been consolidation in retail, share in banking, you know, ever since they got rid of interstate banking laws. That continues apace with the mega banks largely winning, at the expense of the very small banks. And so at some point in the not too distant future, I suspect that there's going to be 5 or 6 players who control retail in the US.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 就像加拿大模式一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: The Canada model. Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。我们的愿望，而且我们正在按计划实现它，我们认为我们可以做到，就是成为这五到六家银行之一。这会带来多大的规模？我不在乎，你只需要对全国各地的消费者都具有相关性。你不应该因为在某个特定市场没有业务而处于劣势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: And our aspiration, and we're on pace to do it. And we think we can do it just to be one of those 5 or 6 banks. What size that leads to? I don't care, you just need to be relevant to consumers everywhere in the, in the country. And you shouldn't be disadvantaged because you don't have presence in a particular market, would it?

</details>

### 零售市场整合与网点密度

**Joe Weisenthal**: 您会如何阐述为什么真正的大银行能持续赢得零售市场份额？我能想出一些答案，但真正的原因是什么？您会如何描述？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How would you articulate why the really big banks continue to win a share of the retail market? I could come up with some answer. But what's the real how would you describe it?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 这是无处不在的市场存在。一旦你在某个特定市场的**网点密度**超过7%，你往往会表现出色，前提是你的声誉良好，产品也不错。你不需要做到最好，但你必须拥有所有数字应用、数字签名、正确位置的网点、电子转账等所有你期望从银行获得的服务。你们可能也在这样的银行办理业务，你在那里成长。如果你考虑这个定义，今天只有三四家银行，实际上只有两家符合这个定义：**摩根大通**和**美国银行**。**富国银行**（Wells）现在取消了资产上限等限制，有潜力继续增长。然后还有一些渴望进入的银行。我们显然是其中之一，而且我们可能是追求这个目标时间最长的人之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: It's ubiquitous market presence. You know, once you get over 7% branch density in a particular market, you tend to outperform, under the assumption you have an okay reputation and decent products. You know, the you don't have to have the best, but you have to have the menu of all the digital applications, digital signature branches in the right place, you know, electronic transfer, all the things you come to expect from the bank. You guys probably bank at, you get there, and you grow. And if you think about that definition, there's only 3 or 4 banks today. Actually only two that fit that definition. JP Morgan A. And B of A, the Wells, you know, has the potential, you know, now that they've gotten rid of the asset cap and so forth to continue to grow. And then you have some aspirants who'd like to get in. There were clearly one of those and one of the one of the people who's been after this game probably longer than most.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 您刚才提到的指标是什么？7%的网点密度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Just so what was the metric that you cited? 7% branch density. What is the.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。顺便说一句，我们使用7%，其他银行会说8%，但大概就在这个范围。如果你在一个市场拥有7%或8%的实体网点份额，并且产品不错，你就能控制该市场实际存款和经济效益的绝大部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So so, by the way, we use 7% other banks. We'll talk about eight, but it's somewhere around there. You get to a place where if you have presence in a market, 7 or 8% of the share of just physical presence with decent products, you control a disproportionate share of the actual deposits in economics coming out of that market.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我听到这个其实很惊讶，因为自金融危机以来，主流观点一直是实体网点没那么重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So I'm actually surprised to hear that because the story, you know, that's dominated since the financial crisis has basically been that physical branches don't matter that much.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。所以你看到全美范围内，网点净关闭数量相对于新建网点数量来说是惊人的。但你在幕后看到的是像**PNC**这样的银行，在我们非常密集的市场，我们已经存在了165年，我们正在减少这些网点，因为你不需要那么多。但我们正在**休斯顿**、**达拉斯**和**迈阿密**积极建设。在收购**First Bank**之前，我们还在**丹佛**建设。所以我们正在进入所有这些人口正在增长的市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So you've seen across the U.S., you know, net closures of branches is off the charts relative to new builds. But what you see behind the scenes is somebody like PNC, where we are, if you think about our very dense markets where we've been for 165 years, we're thinning those branches because you don't need as much. But we're building aggressively in Houston and Dallas and Miami. We were building in Denver until we bought first Bank. So going to all these growing markets where the population's moving.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 天哪，我突然想到，这期节目之后，我想跟进采访一下你们负责选址的主要负责人。因为我们做过关于得来速选址、杂货店选址的节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Man, it just occurred to me, I already after we do this episode, I want to follow up and like do an interview with, like, whoever your main person doing site selection is because we've done episodes on like, oh, we have a drive through site selection, grocery store site selection.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我们有一个很棒的团队正在建设。顺便说一句，我们已经宣布将在这些新市场建设300个网点。另外，当我们完成100个后，我们会再增加100个。所以这个过程会继续下去。我们离最终目标可能还差1000个，但我们不需要明天就达到。不过，每年建设100个网点在选址上就是一项巨大的工程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: We have a great team we're building. But by the way, you know, we've announced we're building 300 branches in these new markets. And as an aside, once we knock 100 off, we'll add another 100. So it's going to keep going. We're probably 1000 short of where we ultimately want to be, but we don't have to be there tomorrow. But just building a hundred branches a year is a mass of exercise on site selection.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你们简直是建筑公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You're a construction company.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的，没错。所以你需要选择正确的位置。你需要决定是做得来速，还是在某个购物中心末端，作为新开发项目的附加部分。实体方面，我们有预设的设计，所以我们知道要建造什么，但你仍然需要承包商，需要有人来运营你搬进网点的实体设施。我们现在有模块化设备。新网点开业时，一辆载有模块化设备的卡车会开过来，网点运行所需的一切，从电脑到纸张到笔，都在这个模块化设备里。直接把它送到网点，这就是我们要做的事情。我们还会进行**First Bank**的转换。顺便说一句，这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yes. I mean exactly right. So you need to pick the right location. You need to choose whether you're going to do a drive through, or you're going to be at the end of some shopping, something where you're kind of an end add on to a to a new development. The physical, you know, we have preset designs so we know what we're building, but you still need a contractor, you need somebody running at the physical plant that you move into the branch. We have pods now. New branch opens. Truck with a pod shows up and everything that that branch needs to run from computers to paper to pens is in a pod. Just deliver it right into the branch, which is what we're going to do. And we do the first bank conversion. As an aside. That's really interesting.

</details>

### 银行监管与并购

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。我们来谈谈银行监管，因为我觉得这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Let's talk about bank regulation because I think this is fun.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Very fun.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我认为这是整合故事的一部分，尽管金融危机后，人们更关注大型银行，即**全球系统重要性银行**（G-SIBs），但与此同时，这些G-SIBs似乎也从某些监管中受益了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This is part of the consolidation story, I think, is that even though post financial crisis, there was more focus on the significant banks, the G sibs, at the same time, those G sib seem to have benefited from, some of the regulation.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是这样吗？您会这样描述吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Is that how you would characterize it?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我不知道他们是否从监管中受益。他们不得不持有额外的资本。他们显然在危机时期表现优于大多数小型银行，就像我们在**硅谷银行**和其他一些银行身上看到的那样。但他们也因此被竞争对手隔离开来。所以，我多年来一直在谈论竞争的必要性。其中一些竞争来自**并购**（M&A）。另一些则需要进行某些活动的能力。从理论上讲，现在或在更容易做到这一点的环境中，这可能是真的。尽管我会告诉你，我认为如果在**拜登政府**时期我们选择进行大型交易，我们本可以做到。我认为人们倾向于喜欢监管机构发出的那种口号：“好的交易没问题，坏的交易不行。”但他们不会告诉你什么是坏的交易。但好的交易通常是当你有一家好银行，有人负责，并且你有技术可以真正吸收另一家银行，并且你可以保护消费者等等。这些交易在上一届政府时期本可以完成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: I don't know that they, I don't know. They benefited from regulation. They had to carry extra capital. They clearly, you know, in times of crisis, have done better than the broad swath of smaller banks, as we saw with Silicon Valley and some others. But they were sort of walled off from competitors. So, you know, I've talked for years about just the need to be able to compete. Some of that competition comes from M&A. Some of it just needs to, you know, the ability to do certain activities. In, in theory now or in an environment where it's easier to do that. And I think practically that's probably true. Although I would tell you, I think we could have done large deals had we chosen to back during the Biden administration. I, I think people tend like one of those sound bites that comes out of regulators is good deals are okay, bad deals aren't. But they won't tell you what a bad deal is. But a good deal is typically when you have one bank, someone one good bank, somebody in charge. Yeah, you have technology that can actually absorb the other bank. And you can protect consumers and so on and so forth. Those could have gotten done in the last administration.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这很有趣。那我们再多谈谈您的并购理念吧。因为您的股票表现一直很好。但有一段时间，尤其是在去年，直到最近，它的表现一直不佳。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's interesting. Well, let's talk about more about your philosophy of M&A because so your stock has done very well. But it has for a while, especially in the last year up until recently had been underperforming. Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 您的原话大概是“所有人都认为我们要搞砸什么”，我不知道确切的引文，但大概是这个意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Some of the other banks. And you're like quote is like everyone thinks we're going to do something like, I don't know, an exact quote, but it's like something. Why does it for the.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 整个世界都认为我很蠢。是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Whole world's betting I'm stupid. Yeah, right.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但你们是如何增长的呢？市场认为你们会做一些事情，所以他们想抛售股票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But so like but then how do you grow? So. Okay, all the market that I want to pay off the stock because they think that you're going to do.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 这不复杂。我们从基本事实开始。去年，我们的营收增长和每股收益（EPS）都超越了所有银行，包括**摩根大通**。我们的增长，抱歉，税前净收入（pre-provision net revenue）。是的，非常棒的一年。我们在新客户获取、营收增长、费用控制、出色的新技术推出等方面都创下了纪录。我们表现不佳的部分背景是，大型银行表现出色，因为人们正确地认为监管将放松，它们可以比以往返还更多的资本。所以，把这部分银行归为一类，它们表现出色，因为它们拥有所有这些资本，可以自由地做任何想做的事情。小型银行的价值上升，因为像我这样口无遮拦的**Bill Demchak**说会有整合，所以大家都会去收购它们。所以它们的价值上升了。而我们作为潜在的收购方，鉴于我们历史上的表现和在整合方面的出色能力，我们却受到了打击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: This is that this isn't this isn't complex. We'll just start with the basics. All right. Last year we outperformed I think everybody including JP Morgan and top line revenue growth and EPS. People in our growth. People, you know. Sorry. You think I know pre pre-provision, net revenue. Okay. Yeah. Fantastic year. We set records and new client acquisition, revenue growth, expense control, great new tech roll and and stuff that we underperform. Part of the backdrop of that was the mega banks outperformed as people correctly thought regulation was going to drop and they could return more capital than they historically had. So take that bucket. They're doing great because they have all this capital and they're free to do whatever they want to. Smaller banks went up in value because, you know, people like Bill Demchak with a big mouth said there's going to be consolidation. So everybody's going to buy them. So they go up in value. And because we are a likely acquirer, given our historical performance and being good at integration, we get. Crushed.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你们是否因为对更宽松并购的预期而受到惩罚？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Did you get penalized from the perception of a more liberal M&A?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 绝对是这样。但部分原因在我。因为我谈论规模的必要性，我谈论零售业正在发生的整合，我谈论为什么这有意义，然后人们就跳到“不惜一切代价”这个结论。这是一个糟糕的假设。不是不惜一切代价。我们可以通过有机增长来实现，只是需要更长的时间。而且，在今天这种所有东西都在飞涨，而我们表现不佳的环境下，我们极不可能找到对我们有经济意义的交易。此外，现在环境非常好，没有一家合理规模的银行愿意出售。这就像八月阳光明媚的日子。利率走势正确，收益率曲线变陡，信贷状况良好，监管正在放松。在这种情况下，没有人会出售他们的银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Absolutely. But it was a part of it's my fault. And, you know, because I talk you know, I talk about the need for scale. I talk about the consolidation that's happening in retail. I talk about why this makes sense and people make this leap and therefore to end the sentence with at any cost. And that's a terrible assumption. Not at any cost. We can do this organically. It just takes longer. And, you know, today with everything flying in value and us underperforming, it's extremely unlikely we find something that makes economic sense for us. Plus, the fact just is inside the environment is so good right now. Nobody none of the reasonable size banks want to sell. This is like, this is like a sunny day in in August, man. You got you know, rates are going the right way. The curve is steepening. Credit's great. Regulation is coming down. Nobody sells their bank in that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 您每天早上都会查看**PNC**的股价吗？我总是好奇这一点。上市公司的CEO们，你们的市场表现会立即被市场评判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Do you wake up every morning and check the PNC share price? I always wonder about this. CEOs of public companies, you're graded instantaneously by the market.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的，但市场有时是不公平的评判者，所以我不会关注它。我们一直关注各种指标：我们是否在赢得客户？我们是否在自动化流程并提高效率？我们的营销活动是否触达了目标人群？我们在数字领域的吸引力如何？所有这些最终都会导致股价表现，但不是在一天之内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yes, but the market at times is an unfair grader, so I don't pay attention to it. You know, when we I look at metrics all the time, are we winning clients? Are we, automating things and getting more efficient? Are we? Is our marketing campaign reaching people? What's our traction level and digital? You know, all these things that ultimately will lead to a share price performance, but not in the day.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，那我们来谈谈。很多银行现在表现不错，它们不想出售。您不是个笨蛋，所以您不想做一笔愚蠢的交易。所以不会有交易，对吧？所以您有成为真正大银行之一的抱负。那么，这就只剩下有机增长了。这是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, let's talk then a little bit about okay, so a lot of banks are doing well. They don't they're not they don't want to sell. Yeah. You're not a stupid guy. So you don't want to make like a dumb deal. So there's there is. So there's not going to be there's. Not going to be deals okay. So you have this aspiration to one of the really big banks. And so okay that leaves organic growth. What is this.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 但从长远来看，我们正处于监管变革的奇怪窗口期，这并非**特朗普政府**时期。在**拜登**之前和之后，交易一直都在进行。我们已经经营了165年。你提到的那个关于所有银行的小图表？是的，我们历史上已经整合了150家银行，而且还会继续下去。但这不需要现在就发生，对吧？现在奇怪的是，我们刚刚结束了拜登执政下四年的奇怪时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: But it also yeah I mean in perspective we're in this the the weird window in regulatory change isn't the Trump administration. It was the Biden administration any time before Biden. And now after Biden deals get done all the time, we're 165 years in business. You know, the little chart you talked about with all the banks? Yeah, we've got to have 150 banks under us through time, and that'll continue. But it doesn't have to happen now, right? The weird thing about now is just we ended the four years of strange period under Biden.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Got it.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 现在我们又回到了老游戏，会一直持续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Now we're just back to the old game will go for, you know, go on and on and on.

</details>

### 有机增长与客户关系

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么，有机增长策略的本质是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So what is the essence of the organic growth strategy to if it's yeah, to grow.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 到目前为止我一直在谈论零售业务。让我谈谈零售业务的原因。零售业务的最终原因在于**零售存款**。零售存款成本低且稳定。它们使你能够通过贷款支持你的企业、社区和消费者。在我们的企业机构银行（Cnib）业务中，我们已经连续15年每年都获得了市场份额。在一个非常分散的市场中，我们谈论大型银行如何获取零售份额。但在企业商业领域，没有人拥有真正的市场份额。它到处都是分散的。我们在这个领域获胜的方式是，在当地市场开展业务。我们进行组织。这听起来可能有点傻，但我们没有按产品划分小组，我们是按客户划分小组。我们进入市场，我们有区域总裁，我们有产品专业知识，我们选择该市场中最重要和最令人印象深刻的客户进行覆盖，而不是其他任何人。我们不一定与那些上门的客户做生意，因为那只是我们能做生意的客户。我们会联系同样的客户，比如你在迈阿密或德克萨斯州想覆盖的客户，我们会联系他们十年，直到他们回电给我们。耐心、坚持、一致性。好的产品理念，非常低的银行家流失率，我们就能赢。然后你只需要在新市场不断重复这个过程，增加人员，并关注收购。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So, so far I've been talking about retail. Let me talk about the reason for retail. So ultimate reason for retail is retail deposits. Retail deposits are low cost or sticky. They allow you to support your corporate community and consumers with loans. We've been able to win and what we call our Cnib business a corporate institutional bank business, gain share every year for the last, I don't know, 15 years. And what is a very fragmented market? You know, we talk about the mega banks gathering retail share. But in corporate commercial nobody has any real share. It's it's it's shotgun everywhere. And we win in that space and we do it by, you know, going to market locally. We organize. And this will all sound kind of silly, but we don't have panels by product. We have panels by client. We go into the market. We have a regional president, we have product expertise, and we choose the most important and impressive clients to cover in that market, not anybody else. We don't do business with somebody necessarily who walks through the door, because that's all that we'll do business with. We'll call on the same rate. A client, you know, that, you know, you want to cover if you're in Miami or you're in Texas, we'll call on them for ten years until they call us back. Patience, persistence, consistency. Good product ideas are real low bank turning banker turnover and we win. And you just, you know, rinse and repeat going to new markets add people keep your eye on.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 关于收购，我真的很好奇，将另一家银行整合到贵公司有多困难，因为您刚才说您擅长整合。这到底意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Just on acquisitions. I'm really curious how difficult it is to integrate another bank with your company because you just said you're good at integration. What does that actually entail?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 这是一个很好的问题。所以整合有一个机械组成部分，然后当然还有一个文化组成部分。机械组成部分本应很容易，但对某些人来说，随着时间的推移却变得困难。谈到**First Bank**的机械组成部分，我们只是简单地获取他们所有的**数据记录**。所以，一个支票账户的数据项记录，我们导入这些数据，但我们不导入他们的应用程序。所有这些数据都进入**PNC**。然后在一个周末，我们简单地在我们现有的产品和服务上开设一百万个新账户。听起来很简单。如果你能移动数据，你就可以有效地开设新账户。我的团队会尖叫，这没那么容易。但基本上你就是这么做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: That's a great question. So integration there's a mechanical component. And then of course there's a cultural component, mechanical component. Should otherwise be easy, but as proven difficult for some people over time, the mechanical components to talk about first bank for us, we simply take all of their data records. So, you know, record field data items that are for one of their checking accounts. And we import that data, but we don't import that application. All that data comes into PNC. And then over a weekend we simply open up a million new accounts on our existing products and services. Sounds pretty simple. If you can move the data, you can just effectively open new accounts. My my team will scream, it's not that easy. But that's basically what you do.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 对您来说看起来很容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It looks easy to you. Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。现在突然间，我们有了所有这些拥有新账户的客户。他们如何登录？他们如何学习？我们的在线平台与别人的在线平台不同。所以现在你进入了培训模块、与客户的沟通、培训他们的网点。**First Bank**的员工和这些一线人员，历史上是一家非常棒的银行。我们现在保留了他们所有面向客户的员工。他们突然之间必须知道**PNC**产品和他们旧产品之间的区别。那么我们如何做到这一点？这就是整合最终的含义。它有一个机械部分，让系统正常工作。所以你打开它，灯就亮了。还有向网点运送模块化设备，这样他们就拥有所有**PNC**的设备、标牌和所有其他东西。但有很多时间是花在人身上的。我们派驻网点伙伴。我们会从全国各地调派网点经理，让他们在**First Bank**的每个网点待上几周，与那里的员工一起工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Now all of a sudden, okay, now we have all these customers with new accounts. How do they how do they log in? How do they learn? Like our online is different than somebody else is online. So now you're getting into training modules, communications with clients, training their branches with first Bank trims and this front line set of people incredible bank in history. We're keeping all their client facing employees now. They all of a sudden have to know the difference between PNC products and their old products. So how do we do that? That's what integration ultimately means. There's a mechanical piece of it. Get the systems to work. So you turn it on, the lights go on. There's delivering pods to the branches. So they have all the PNC equipment and the signage and all that other stuff. But there's a lot of time with people. We send in branch buddies. So we'll take branch managers from all around the country and go have them spend, you know, a couple of weeks in each, you know, sitting with the branches at first Bank.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这有助于您的视角。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That just helps your perspective. Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。学习。我的意思是，银行业在某些方面很简单，在某些方面又极其复杂。网点里的员工，你可能会遇到的问题。对吧？你可能会说，我不太去网点，或者我不考虑这些，但当你去网点时，通常是出了大问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: And the learning and it's I mean banking, you know, in some ways is simple. In some ways it's wildly complex. An employee in a branch, the problems that you might walk in. Right. You say, oh, I don't really go into a branch or I don't think about it, but when you go into a branch, something's really busted. Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。所以员工们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So the employees.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所以员工们。对。他们需要知道如何解决问题。这就是我们说我们擅长整合的原因。因为我们专注于确保我们的新同事知道如何做好他们的工作，并且能够帮助他们的客户，因为他们拥有一直以来的客户。他们不想在新职位上表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So the employees. Right. They need to know how to fix it. And that's when we say we're good at integrations. It's because we focus on making sure that our new teammates know how to do their job and can help their clients because they have the same clients they've had forever. They don't want to look bad in their new role.

</details>

### AI在银行运营中的应用

**Tracy Alloway**: 您能详细谈谈这些答案吗？比如，他们现在需要知道如何销售或熟悉**PNC**的产品。请再多谈谈这些差异，功能上实际发生了什么变化，为什么它不仅仅是更换标志和笔，而是关于文化或产品的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can you actually just talk more about the answers, like, okay, they need to know how to like, sell or be familiar with the PNC product now, like talk a little bit more about like what that difference is, what actually changes functionally, why it wouldn't be what it is about either culture or products such that it's not just replacing the the logo and the pens.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所有的东西在细节上都略有不同。我的意思是，支票账户就是支票账户。但想象一下，你在一个网点或客服中心。你遇到了问题。你支付了车贷，按时发送了，但它通过慢速邮件寄送，丢失了。你被罚款了。你去了网点，你说，这真的不公平，我寄了，你却要罚我款。网点的人会怎么做？对。对此总有一些答案。我们的程序是什么？现在有了**AI**，你可以直接进入一个基于我们所有客户服务协议构建的**大型语言模型**，然后问：“我该怎么办？刚刚发生了这件事。”它会告诉你，比如，给客户退还费用，然后给某某发个通知，不管那个特定问题的答案是什么。但坐在那里的员工需要知道，我该查询哪个系统？我的浏览器是什么？我该和谁交谈？如果我要破例，我应该去找网点经理吗？还是我们可以在这里处理？或者我需要打电话给**费城**某个后台办公室的陌生房间里的人吗？所有这些，因为我们自动化了大部分，现在都集中在网点的查询中心和**自主学习**。更重要的是，越来越多的客户可以**自助服务**，比如他们被锁定了账户，他们可以自己解决问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: And the well, everything works at the margin, slightly different. I mean, checking accounts, a checking account. But imagine you're you're in a branch or you're in the care center. You have a problem. You made your car payment, you sent it through. It was time stamped the right time, but it went through snail mail, got lost. You got penalized a fee, and you go to the branch and you say, you know, it's really not fair. I sent this, and I you're hitting me with the fee and the branch person. What do they do? Right. It's there's there's some answer to that. What's our procedure? Well, you know, now with AI, you can just go into a large language model that is built off of all of our customer service protocols and say, what do I do? This just happened. They'll tell you, you know, credit the customer the fee and send a note to the, you know, whatever the answer is for that particular problem. But the person sitting there needs to know like which system do I query. What's my browser, what am I who do I talk to. You know, if I'm going to make an exception do I go to the branch manager or can we do that here. Or do I want to call somebody in some strange room in a back office and Philadelphia, all of that with us, because we automate so much of it is now center of query and self-learning in the branch. And then importantly, more and more with our customers self caring, you know, they get locked out. You know, just just be able to fix the problem yourself.

</details>

### 信贷审批与本地专业知识

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我几年来一直在想一件事，在零售或商业信贷的实际承保方面，本地专业知识还重要吗？因为我认为大多数美国人过去对银行有一种非常浪漫化的观念，就像《美好人生》那种模式，你的分行经理了解你，了解你的整个生活和生意。我的感觉是现在这种情况已经不多了。但如果我错了，请告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: One thing I've wondered for a few years, does local expertise matter anymore when it comes to actual underwriting, either in retail or commercial? Because I think most of America used to have this very romanticized notion of the banks, the sort of It's a Wonderful Life model, where you're your branch manager, knows you and knows your entire life and business and all of that. My sense is that doesn't exist so much anymore. But tell me if I'm wrong.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 你错了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: You're wrong.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 当你成为一家大银行时，这更难实现。但是，信贷是如何随着时间演变的呢？消费者。如果他们是你的现有客户，现在会根据你看到的现金流进行评分。所以不是**FICO分数**。你实际上可以看到某人何时支付了租金，或者他们的消费模式是否可预测。你可以建立模型来判断，这个人是一个非常勤勉的好信用客户，即使这可能不会出现在像本地市场业务中。你要贷款给这个小型开发商，你要贷款给街角的这家商店。对于小企业来说，网点和本地银行家真的很重要，因为我能看到人流量在哪里。他们了解经营这家企业的人的声誉。这些人，他们是否以积极的方式影响社区，人们是否愿意支持他们。所有这些仍然很重要。所有这些，你越能让当地人在决策中有发言权，我总是称之为在某种程度上给一个原本机械的“是”或“否”的决定加上一点主观判断，你的**信贷承保**也会越好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: It's harder to accomplish when you become a larger bank. But, you know, how is credit evolved through time? Consumers. Consumers. Now, if they're an existing client of you are scored based on their cash flows that you see. So not a fight go score. You can actually see when did somebody pay the rent or their spending patterns predictable. You can build models to see you know what. This person is a really diligent good credit even though it might should not show up in a like a local market business. You're going to lend to this small developer, you're going to lend to this store on the corner. Branches really matter and local bankers matter for small businesses because I see where the foot traffic is. They know the reputation of the person who's running that business. The people you know, are they a, community influencer in a good way, where they're, you know, people want to support them. All that stuff still matters and all that stuff. The more you can give somebody voice locally in the decision, I always kind of call it putting a thumb on the scale a little bit on a yes or no that's otherwise mechanical. The better your credit underwriting as well.

### 信用卡利率上限的影响

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们正在谈论消费信贷。如果像**特朗普总统**提议的那样，**信用卡**利率上限为10%，世界、美国或这个行业会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It's just we're talking about consumer credit. What happens to what happens to the world, what happens to America or the industry if there's a 10% cap on credit card rates? As president Trump has proposed?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所以，如果发生这种情况，我唯一能确定的是，如果按照今天的方式运营，全国所有的信用卡业务都会亏损。我们有信用卡业务。我收取刷卡费，大部分会通过奖励返还。当有人循环使用余额时，我赚取信用。当有人在月底还清时，我提供信用。对。我为你垫付这笔钱。如果你每个月都结清账户，但希望我能通过刷卡费赚到钱。所有这些之后，你收取利息，你会有损失，然后你获得利润，也许能赚4%的假设利息。我这里只是随便说些数字，但假设平均利率是18%。我最终赚4%。如果有人把我的18%降到10%，那我就会亏损4%。所有这些计算都会出来。这就是为什么我不认为这会发生，几乎不可能发生。你只会简单地关闭美国的消费信贷。他们不能强迫，他们可以说上限是10%，我会说，好的，我退出。我为什么要去做一个每年亏损4%的生意呢？一些事情会改变。费用会上升，额度会被削减，奖励会消失。然后一些新的东西会从尘埃中出现，但它看起来会和今天完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So the only thing I know for sure, if that happens, is that all the credit card businesses in the country lose money, if run exactly the way they are today. So we have, you know, credit card business. I get swipe fees, I get most of those away with rewards. I earn credit when somebody is revolving a balance. I lend credit when somebody pays it at the end of the month. Right. I'm fronting that money for you. If you clear your account every month. But hopefully I'm getting some swipe fees to make that good. After all that, you charge interest rates, you have losses and you get a margin, maybe make 4% and assume interest. I make it up numbers here, but assume maybe the average rate is 18%. I make four at the bottom. Nothing going to take my 18. I'm going to drop it to ten. Oh. I just made minus four. It's all that math is going to come out. Which is why I don't think this goes like there's almost no way this can happen. You'll just simply shut down consumer credit in the US. They can't force they can say the cap is 10% and I'll say, fine, I'm out. I'm like, why would I do it if I'm going to lose 4% a year on that, something's going to change. Fees are going to go up, lines are going to get cut, rewards will go away. You know, and something will emerge out of the dust, but it's not going to look at all like it does today.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 您认为这项提案的起源或其背后的理由是什么？如果业内所有人都说这基本上会终结信用卡业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What do you think the genesis of the proposal or the rationale behind it actually is? If you know, everyone in the industry says this basically ends credit cards.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的，我认为首先是它的情感吸引力。我的意思是，你向某人收取18%的循环信贷利息听起来很荒谬。我认为这听起来很高。但这恰好是你需要收取的利率才能赚钱。但它听起来很高，这就是为什么我从不循环使用余额，我每个月都还清。所以有一种情感上的吸引力。天哪，你应该能够放贷。比如，我以10%的利率借钱给你。我以10%的利率借钱给你。谢谢。对。但我不能在茫茫人海中准确地找出你是谁，对吧？有很多人。我以4%的利率借钱，因为我永远也收不回来。你知道，这就是问题所在。你试图覆盖更广泛的人群，向推动我们经济的消费者提供信贷。科学并不是那么精确，能说你得到9%，你得到22%。我不知道你怎么样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah, I think because first of all, the emotional appeal of it, it's I mean, it sounds absurd that you're charging somebody 18% for revolving credit. I think that sounds high. That happens to be the rate that you need to charge to make money. But it sounds, which is why I never revolve a balance. I pay it off every month. So there's this emotion appeal. Geez, you ought to be able to lend. Like I'll lend money to you at 10%. I'll lend money to you at 10%. Thanks. Right. But I can't necessarily figure out who you are in a sea of people, right? There's a bunch of people. I'll lend money at 4% because I'll never to pull it. You know, that's the issue. And you try to get to the broader population and extend credit to the consumer. That drives our economy. Science isn't so exact to say you get nine and you're 22. I don't know about you.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 实际上，我想反驳一下，因为直觉上我会认为你们能够做到这一点。您刚才提到，你们可以获得详细的还款倾向数据，甚至连**FICO分数**都无法捕捉到。是的，你们拥有大量数据和预测能力。以及**Tracy**是否会循环使用余额的差异。所以当有人说18%似乎很高时，我们是否应该相信？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, actually, I want to push because intuitively, I would think you'd be able to do that. You just mentioned the fact that you have granular access to propensity to pay back, that it's not even captured by. Yes, you have incredible amounts of data and predictive capacity. And the difference between whether mere trace you're going to revolve. So when someone says 18% seems high, yeah. Are we supposed to just like, believe?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 哦，相信我，这很高。这是我在这项业务中赚钱所需要收取的费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Oh, just trust me, it's high. This is what I need to charge in order to make money in this business.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我的意思是，我可以相信您，但我想知道您会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I mean, I could trust you, but I'm like, how would you?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 但数学就是数学。好的，最终结果。对吧？你说当你运行你的模型并查看还款倾向时，你基本上，无论是看**FICO**还是其他任何东西，一个FICO分数的好坏取决于那个人下周是否还有工作。对。他们，你可以查看可预测性，是的，这个人一直在支付房租。他们在食物、汽油和娱乐方面的支出模式稳定。他们的储蓄账户余额总是保持相当稳定。这应该是一个好的信用。但如果他们因为经济衰退而被解雇或失业，那就不是一个好的信用了。突然之间，我以为这是一个非常好的信用，我应该收取5%的利息。结果我把整个东西都冲销了，因为那笔信贷没有任何回收价值。这就是科学失败的地方。存在你无法建模的外部变量，你撒的网越广，结果的分散性就越大。然而，如果我们已经确定了那个利率设定了一个合理的利润率。全国最大的发卡机构，你可以猜到是谁，对吧？拥有最好的计算机模型，最好的融资信贷，最好的向非优级借款人提供信贷。他们的交易价格是账面价值的一倍。如果这是一个天才的生意，那太多了。我会把利率降低1%，然后增加市场份额。问题是，它实际上并没有那么好。

<details>

**Bill Demchak**: But the math is the math. Okay, the end result. Right? You say when you run your models and you look at, you know, propensity to pay you back, you basically, you know, whether you're looking at Flaco or anything, a Fico is only as good as whether that person has a job next week. Right. They, they you know you can look at predictability and yes this person has been paying their rent. They have a steady expenditure thing on food and on gas and on entertainment. And their savings account balances always stay pretty steady. That ought to be a good credit. Well it isn't a good credit. If they get fired or lose their job because the economy's in a downturn. And all of a sudden, well, I thought that was a really good credit. I should charge 5%. Turns out I just wrote the whole thing off because there's no recovery value in that credit. That's that's where the science fails. There's there's exogenous variables you can't model in the wider you cast the net, right. The bigger the dispersion on outcomes. However, if we've settled there, that interest rate kind of sets a reasonable profit margin. The largest card issuer in the country, you could figure out who this is, right? Best at best computer models, best funding credit, best expand. You know, extending credit to to to non-prime borrowers. They trade at one times book value. That this was a genius business like this way too much. I'd drop the rate by 1% you know and gross share. The problem is, it's not so great, actually.

### 私人信贷与信贷周期

**Tracy Alloway**: 我想谈谈**私人信贷**。因为这显然是一个我们总是听到银行面临来自中型市场贷方新竞争的领域。但与此同时，我们也看到银行现在与私人信贷合作。在我看来也是如此。好的，请给我们解释一下这种关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I want to talk about private credit a little bit. Because obviously this is an area where we always hear about banks face new competition from middle market lenders and all of that. But at the same time, we also see banks teaming up with private credit now. And it seems to me also. Yeah. Okay. Talk us through that relationship.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。所以传统上，独立的**高收益信贷**，如果你所做的只是四处走动放贷，没有特别的专业知识，但却针对单一的大额信贷的杠杆客户，那资本回报率真的很糟糕，对吧？所有的科学研究，追溯到**穆迪**在80年代开始追踪这些数据，你大概能获得35%的回收率。你有10%的违约率。你会经历周期，有时更糟，有时更好。这不是一个特别好的生意。如果将它与公司除了信贷之外的**钱包业务**结合起来，它就会变成一个更好的生意，有时甚至是一个非常棒的生意。比如**IPO**、并购费、债券费，所有这些伴随而来的东西，突然之间它就变成了一个相当不错的生意。过去几年发生的事情是，我们看到越来越多的信贷从银行流向**私募股权**和其他另类形式。在**PNC**，这表现为我们可能有一个家族客户，我们已经为他们服务了一百年，现在这个第三代家族企业被卖给了私募股权公司，我们的客户就没了，因为我不想以那个杠杆率提供那笔贷款。而无论谁提供那笔贷款，都会要求获得资金管理关系以及与该客户相关的所有其他业务。所以我们对此的看法是，我不知道我是否一定想提供那笔贷款。有时我会，但我想保持这种关系。所以我们与**TCW**的合作就是一个例子。当这种情况发生时，我们现在将资金投入**TCW基金**，就像其他许多人一样。但现在发生的是，我们会保留客户，我们会分散信贷风险，但保留费用。所以这项业务的**股本回报率**会大大提高。整个概念，还记得吗，过去三年里的私人信贷。天哪，真是个新事物。我们很擅长。我们会让你发大财。为什么私募股权有点陷入困境？因为没有东西被出售。他们需要筹集新资金。我们已经十年没有违约了。所以一位经理出现并说，看看我的业绩记录。我可以以两倍的杠杆率，在扣除费用后给你10%的回报。这太棒了。私募股权很糟糕，跟我来吧。当然，我们已经十年没有经历信贷周期了，所以那些数据都是垃圾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So traditionally, standalone high yield credit, if all you did was walk around and just lend money, with no particular expertise but across, you know, leveraged clients at a single big credit. That's a really lousy return on capital, right? The, you know, all the science going back to and Moody's started tracking this stuff in the 80s. You get kind of a 35% recovery. You have a 10% default rate. You go through cycles sometimes a lot worse, sometimes a lot better. It's not a particularly good business. Becomes a a better business and sometimes a fantastic business. If you couple that with the wallet that goes with that company beyond just the credit. So IPOs, M&A fees bond feel, you know, whatever the stuff is that goes along with all of a sudden it becomes a pretty good business what's happened in the last couple of years we've seen this drift into more and more credit, leaving banks going into private equity and other alternative forms that PNC, it manifested itself where we'd have a client that we might have banked for a hundred years on by third generation family that just got sold to private equity, and our client's gone, because I don't want to make that loan at that leverage ratio. And whoever does make the loan is going to demand the Treasury management relationship and all the other stuff that goes with that client. So are we come out at it is I don't know that I necessarily want to make the loan. I will sometimes, but I want to keep the relationship. So our partnership with TCW is an example is when that happens. Now we, you know, we put capital in the TCW fund, as did a bunch of other people, but happens now. We'll keep the client, you know, we'll diversify the credit risk but keep the fees. So the return on equity on that thing, you know, goes way up the whole notion, remember, like private credit in the last three years. Oh my God. So new thing. We're great at it. We're going to make you a fortune. Why is it private equity kind of hit the skids. Nothing was getting sold. They need to raise new money. We haven't had defaults in ten years. So a manager shows up and says, look at my track record. I can earn, you know, with two times leverage, I'll give you 10% return after fees. This is fantastic. Private equity sucks. Come with me. Of course, we haven't had a credit cycle in ten years, so those stats are all garbage.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。当你真正经历一个信贷周期，并且你有两倍的杠杆，然后你开始出现违约，我们已经有一些了，那就不那么令人兴奋了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. You know, I actually go through a credit cycle and you have two times leverage on that thing, and you start having defaults, which we've had a few of us on. It's not really exciting.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我可以在这次对话中问一个宏观问题吗？您认为我们目前处于信贷周期的哪个阶段？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Can I ask one macro question in this conversation, which is where where do you think we are in the credit cycle at the moment?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我已经放弃预测了。今天的信贷状况相当好。比相当好还要好。系统中的许多杠杆，大家都在抱怨的，实际上都与具有非常好的**企业价值**的事物有关。所以我不太担心公司的消失。我把它看作是所有权结构的重新分配。对，他们过度杠杆化了。他们要么被私募股权公司救助，要么他们说，不，这是钥匙。现在债务持有人拥有了公司，然后债务持有人重组债务并再次出售。有人亏了钱。但公司仍然是家好公司，只是过度杠杆化了。但你现在听到的关于信贷的大部分噪音，除了欺诈，你知道**杰米**说的，当事情紧张时，蟑螂就会出现。大部分都是不错的企业，只是过度杠杆化了。然后当然还有欺诈。今天还没有真正出现什么问题，因为经济并没有立即崩溃。除了关税方面的一些孤立问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: I've given up trying to predict that credit today is pretty good. Better than pretty good. A lot of the leverage that's in this system that everybody complains about are actually with things that are very good enterprise value. So I don't worry so much about the disappearance of a company. I think about it in terms of reallocation of the ownership structure right over there, over leveraged. They go down either private equity firm bails them out or they say, no, here are the keys. And now the debt holder owns and then the debt holder restructures the debt and sells them again. Somebody lost money. But companies still a good company was just over levered to to go. But most of the noise you're hearing right now on credit beyond the fraud, you know the cockroaches that Jamie said come up when things get stretched. Most of it are decent enterprises just over levered. And then of course, you have the fraud. You haven't had anything that's really going down today because the economy just crashed on the spot. Other than some isolated issues with tariffs.

</details>

**发言人**: 欺诈行为具有周期性，对吧？因为在经济繁荣时期，人们往往会视而不见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: There is a cyclical element to fraud, right. Because in good times people look the other way.

</details>

**发言人**: 我不认为它是周期性的，我认为它一直都在。我只是觉得，谁说的来着，“当潮水退去时，你就能知道谁在裸泳。”我想是**巴菲特**说的。是的，是的。然而，**加尔布雷斯**谈到了“欺诈泡沫”（the bezzle）。对，在经济繁荣时期，欺诈和骗局往往更容易滋生，人们对此熟视无睹，然后这些问题不断积累。但这可能就是我们已经经历了20年的原因，就像你说的，我们没有经历过信贷危机。我的意思是，自金融危机以来，现在已经差不多20年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And I don't I don't think it's cyclical. I think it's always there. I just think you know the who's a said, you know when the water goes out you can figure out who's swimming nude. I think it was buffet. Buffet. Yeah. Yeah. Well Galbraith however, talked about the bezzle. Right. The, the the propensity of flimflam and scams to exist during the good times and people just like, and that accumulates and accumulates and. That could be. We've had like 20 years, as you said, like we were the credits. I mean, we're it's almost 20 years since the financial crisis now.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，金融总能找到办法自我引爆。我的意思是，这并非个人观点，看看历史就知道了。我认为发生的情况是，我们找到了好东西，然后就一直利用它们。在每一次出现问题的情况下，你都会不断地推动某件事，直到它超越极限。对。金融业是一个历史上可以赚很多钱的行业，对吧？你在玩别人的钱，从别人的钱里赚取一分一厘。我只会不断地推动，不断地推动。当它最终崩溃时，就会彻底崩盘。我们还没有经历过，你知道，现在有什么新事物？是**金融科技**和**加密货币**，银行业已经被监管束缚了十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. The finance always finds its way, finds a way to blow itself up. I mean, it's it's yeah. I mean, it's, you know, it's not an opinion. And just look at history. I think what happens is you get you get, you know, we find good things and then you write them and you. Yeah. In every instance where something's gone wrong, you just keep pushing on something till you take it over the edge. Right. Finance is an industry where historically you can make a lot of money at it, right? You're playing with other people's money, you know, pennies and nickels coming off of other people's money. I'm just going to keep pushing. I'm going to keep pushing and keep pushing. When it finally falls, it falls hard. We haven't had that, you know, what's the new, new thing now? It's fintech and it's crypto and it's, you know, banking has been kind of throttled by regulation for ten years.

### 硅谷银行危机与贴现窗口

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈到金融总是能找到办法自我引爆，我们能谈谈**硅谷银行**和2023年吗？因为他们确实因为各种原因自我引爆了。但其中一个原因是他们持有的债券太多了，这有点不寻常。那对您来说是怎样的经历？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, speaking of finance, always finding a way to blow itself up. Can we talk about, Silicon Valley Bank and 2023 because, you know, they managed to blow themselves up, for a variety of reasons. But one of them was they just had too many bonds, which is kind of, you know, an unusual one. What was that experience like for you?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 首先，我们回到**硅谷银行**。我实际上认为他们有一个很棒的机构。他们一直这么说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: First of all, Let's well, let's go back to Silicon Valley. I actually think they had a great institution. They had. Been saying that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谁一直在说他们需要这个关于硅谷银行或勘探者的插头？好的，继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Who's been saying that they need terms of this plug on the silicon Valley bank or prospectors. Okay. Keep going.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 不，它只是一个独特的商业模式，拥有非常忠诚的客户群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: No, it's just it it's it was a unique business model with a very loyal client base that they.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 没那么忠诚。我的意思是，如果你是**戴安**，忠诚度就荡然无存了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Not that loyal in. The, I mean, look at, you know, if you're Diane, loyalty goes out the window. But,

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 但他们在一个与他们基本业务完全无关的方面自我引爆了。对吧？利率非常低。根据一些计算，他们的久期像90年代的**长期资本管理公司**一样长。我的意思是，他们真的杠杆率很高，并且低估了存款的**负凸性**。对。你认为平均而言，在整个周期中，它们会在那里七年，但它们明天就消失了。所以他们只是在利率问题上自我引爆了，这与他们的核心竞争力或作为一家特许经营银行的本质毫无关系。这很不幸，但我的意思是，这只是一个新手错误。没有什么。这只是一个疯狂的头寸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: they blew themselves up in something that was not at all of their basic business. Right? Interest rates are super low. They got as long by some calculations as, like, long term capital was back in the night. I mean, they were really, really levered and underestimated the negative convexity deposits. Right. You think you know on average through the cycle they're going to be there seven years ups. They're gone tomorrow. And so they just they blew themselves up on rates that had nothing to do with their core competence or what they were as a franchise. And it's unfortunate, but I mean, it was just it was rookie mistake. There was nothing. There's just a crazy position to be in.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那些日子之后有多可怕？然后人们开始寻找任何名字里有“加利福尼亚”的银行，人们在做空它，或者有新闻标题说区域银行指数，区域银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How like how scary, you know, those those days afterwards. And then people started hunting for like any, any bank that had the word California in the name, like people were shorting it or people were they. Or, you know, you had headlines where, you know, the regional bank index, the regional bank.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 这就是为什么我是一家全国性银行。我们不是区域银行，因为下次他们把区域银行的标题放进去时，我不想被牵扯进去。实际上，我们在这期间受益了。我们是一个避风港。我们在这段时间里确实获得了存款，开设了数千个新账户。然后每天都有人发布区域银行指数，我们的估值就会受到打击，这没关系。它总是这样。估值是短期的。之后一切都迅速恢复了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: And it's why I'm a national bank. We are not a regional bank, because the next time they put regional bank headlines in there, I don't want to be associated together. Now, we actually benefited during that. You know, we're we're a safe haven. And we actually gathered deposits and opened thousands of new accounts during that period of time. And then every day somebody would flash the regional bank index and we'd get blasted on our valuation, which is fine. It always yeah. You know, valuations are short term. It all came ripping back after that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 2023年银行业危机期间出现的一个问题，我想是**贴现窗口**以及银行集体不愿使用它的情况。这是**美联储**一直在努力改变的事情。对。实际上，您还记得2022年末，贴现窗口的使用量有一个很大的飙升吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So one of the issues that came up during the 2023 banking drama, I guess, is the discount window and the banks reluctance collectively to use it. And this is something that the fed has been trying to change. Right. And actually, do you remember in late 2022, there was a big spike in, tapping?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 贴现窗口的使用。结果发现，那不是任何一家最终陷入困境的银行。那是**德克萨斯州**的**Bill Bank**。那是一家奇怪的银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Usage of the discount window. And it turned out that wasn't any of the banks that, like, ended up getting into trouble. It was Bill Bank down in Texas. It's a weird bank.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的，那是一家非常奇怪的银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah, it's a very weird bank.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但无论如何，监管机构正试图让银行更多地使用贴现窗口，让他们对此感到更自在。您对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But anyway, regulators trying to get banks to use the discount window more, feel more comfortable with it. How do you feel about it?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 这是一个很好的问题。所以在金融危机之前和监管、**LCR**（流动性覆盖率）和长期债务提案等所有这些东西之前，有一个非常活跃的**联邦基金市场**。所以在某一天，银行存放在其**美联储**账户中的超额准备金非常少，我们会互相交易联邦基金。如果我需要20亿，你会给我20亿。第二天我可能会给你20亿，这种大额的联邦基金头寸。这就是你每天晚上平衡账簿的方式。然后他们出来说，等等，我们不希望你再那样做了。有一个LCR规定。你必须留出这么多流动性。而不是进入联邦基金市场，这导致了所有这些超额准备金，联邦基金市场基本上是美联储设定利率，没有人按照那个利率交易。它就像**LIBOR**一样死了。它消失了。我甚至不知道他们为什么还要谈论它。现在他们基本上对你说，不要使用贴现窗口，而是持有所有这些现金。你只是冻结了经济，因为你停止了资本流转。**住房贷款银行**介入，因为我必须持有所有这些国债和抵押贷款证券。我可以把它们抵押给住房贷款银行，他们会以相当好的利率借钱给我。所以那将是我的出路。我会去找住房贷款银行，然后以相当好的利率借款，或者我会回购我持有的国债。**硅谷银行**事件发生了。他们有住房贷款，他们没有任何贴现窗口额度。现在贴现窗口会简单地以国债和机构债券为抵押放贷，因为这基本上是通过**美联储电汇系统**进行电子结算的。如果你抵押贷款，抵押起来真的很难。所以如果我只有证券可以抵押，我应该直接回购它们，或者我把它们交给住房贷款银行。贴现窗口会做更多的事情。但如果我想提取我的贷款余额，我需要给他们物理的、有湿签名的贷款文件，放在一个24小时有人看守、审计的保险库里，就像有一个花园一样。我把湿签名文件堆起来，这样他们就知道当我提取那笔贷款时，我确实拥有那笔贷款，因为它不像债券那样通过美联储电汇结算。这是一笔贷款，对吧？我借钱给你，你签了字，我把它放在某个地方。然后你说，好吧，我们预先放置这些贷款。**PNC**花费了数百万美元。所以我们绝大多数的**CNI贷款**现在都在贴现窗口。我们不借用它们，但它们在那里。如果我们想借用它们的话。我打了个电话。情况好了一点，但你不能完成它。我必须完成它，所以情况好了一点。但基本上，就像在疫情期间，或者疫情之后，当办公室里没有人时，你会打电话，就像你向这些公司借钱的方式，你打电话给**克利夫兰**。他们是美联储的人。然后他们说，好的，你状况良好，华盛顿会允许你使用贴现窗口。然后他们会打电话给华盛顿，然后可能一天左右之后，你就能拿到钱。当办公室里没有人时，没有人会接电话。我需要从贴现窗口提款。它只是响着，没有人。没有系统。我不能像输入就能提款。我不能像通过经纪人进行联邦基金交易就能提款。它是不可用的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: But that's a great question. So before the financial crisis and before regulation, and LCR and long term debt proposals and all that other stuff, there was a very active fed funds market. So in a given day, the excess reserve a bank would hold deposited in its fed account was tiny, and we would trade fed funds around with each other. If I needed 2 billion, you'd give me 2 billion. Next day I might give you 2 billion, like big size fed fund positions. And that's how you balance your books at the end of every night. And then they come out and they say, hang on, we don't want you doing that anymore. There's an LCR. You have to have this much liquidity stuck aside. Instead of going into the fed funds market that gave rise to all these excess reserves, fed fund markets, basically the fed sets that rate, nobody trades on that rate. It's as dead as LIBOR. It's gone. I don't even know why they talk about it anymore. Now you have they basically said to you, don't use the discount window and hold all this cash. You just froze the economy because you stopped the circulation and of, of of capital transformation. Home loan banks step in because I have to hold all of these treasuries and mortgage securities. I can pledge them the home loan and they'll lend me money at a pretty good rate. So that's going to be my outlet. I'm going to go to a home loan and I'm just going to borrow. They're at a pretty good rate or I'm going to repo my treasuries that I hold. Silicon Valley happens. And they had home loan loans. They didn't have any discount window lines. Now the discount window will lend against treasuries and agencies pretty simply because it's basically settled electronically through effectively the fed wire system. If you're pledging loans, it's really hard to pledge. So if all I have is securities to pledge, I should just repo them or I'll give them to the home loan bank discount window will do more than that. But if I want to draw against my loan balance, I need to give them physical wet signature loan docs in a vault guarded, audited 24 hours a day like there's going to be a garden. I wet signatures stacked up so they know that when I draw against that loan, I actually have that loan because it doesn't settle fed wire like a bond does. This is a loan, right? I lend you money, you sign the thing, I put it in the door somewhere. Then you say, all right, let's pre-position these loans we spent PNC spent millions and millions and millions of dollars. So the vast majority of our CNI loans are now at the discount window, We don't borrow on them, but they're there. If we wanted to borrow under them. I got a call. It's gotten a little better, but you can't finish it. That I got to finish it, so it's gone a little better. But basically, like during Covid, you know, or post Covid, when nobody is coming in the office, you'd call, like the way you borrow from these companies, you call it Cleveland. There are there are fed to all this. And then they say, okay, you're in good shape, will allow Washington to allow you to use the discount window. And then they'll call Washington and then maybe like a day or so later, you can have money when nobody is coming in the office, nobody would answer the phone. I got to draw in the discount window. It just rings. Nobody's there. There's no system. It's not like I can type in and draw. It's not like I can do a fed funds trade through a broker and draw the money. It's it's unusable.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但现在你们已经预先放置好了，如果需要的话，可以以贷款为抵押进行借款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But now you're pre-positioned. Yeah. To borrow against loans. If you need to.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。我们手头有足够的流动性，基本上可以应对任何可能发生的情况，因为我们已经将所有抵押品放置在最佳位置。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. We have enough liquidity on hand basically to cover anything that can happen because we positioned all of our collateral and the optimal spots.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而且我们刚刚得到了，您提到物理位置，因为您在谈论湿签名文件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Plus we just got you talk about physical spot when you say you because you're talking about like wet signature documents.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。所以实际上，唯一可以以**CNI贷款**为抵押借款的地方就是贴现窗口。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So the only place you can borrow against CNI loans in effect is the discount window.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。所以他们会去那里。那是湿签名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So okay. So okay. So they're going to go over there. That's what signature.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我可以在回购市场、住房贷款银行或美联储以证券为抵押借款。所以这就是**硅谷银行**事件中抵押品放置的混乱之处。我有500亿美元现金存放在美联储的超额准备金账户中。所以那是即时流动性。我拥有大量国债，如果需要的话可以出售。所以你只需要弄清楚，我如何才能从这些资产中获得最大的收益？我正在预先放置，但要确保它们在正确的位置。这样，如果我在紧急情况下需要流动性，我就能获得。**硅谷银行**没有这样做，美联储也没有让他们轻易做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: I can borrow against securities in the repo market at the home loan or the fed. So this is kind of the confusion that happened with where was stuff pledged with Silicon Valley. I have, you know, 50 billion of cash sitting on the Fed's excess reserve book. So that's instant liquidity. And I own a whole bunch of treasuries that I can sell if I had to. So you just you figure out how do I optimally earn whatever I can on these assets? I'm pre-positioning, but get them in the right place. So if I need liquidity in an emergency, I can get it. Silicon Valley did not do that, and the fed did not make it easy for them to do that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我想澄清一下，当您说“把它们放在正确的位置”时，您是指一个物理位置吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I'm just going to be clear when you say get them in the right place, you mean like a physical place?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 有些是物理的，比如贷款，那些湿签名的。我真的认为我们把它们带到一个金库里，然后转动一个大转盘，它们就被锁在里面了。但证券是通过**Cusip**代码，你会说，这批承兑汇票已经预先放置在美联储。所以我知道它们在哪里。我知道余额。我知道我可以立即通过美联储电汇系统发送它们并提款。所以就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Some of it's physical, like the loans, the wet signature ones. I literally think we take them down to, like, a vault and spin a dial, you know, with the big, the big crank, and they get locked in there. But, no securities by Cusip, you would say. Like this, Birch accepts, is pre-positioned with the fed. So I just know where they are. I know the balances. I know I can send them right over fed wire and draw on that. So it's it's it's that thing. Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 关于贴现窗口，我一直想知道一件事。历史上银行不愿使用它的部分原因是他们担心这会泄露到市场。对。然后会有他们正在利用市场的谣言。这到底是如何发生的？我不明白这些泄露。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: One thing I always wondered with the discount window. So part of the reluctance historically to tap it on the part of banks has been they're worried it'll get out into the market. Right. And there'll be rumors that they're tapping the market. How does that actually happen? I don't understand the leaks.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所以理论上，因为假设有人从美联储提取了资金。贴现窗口是区域性美联储。假设有人通过**克利夫兰联储**从贴现窗口提取了1000亿甚至200亿美元，这就像对**PNC**征税一样。所以人们可以找出是谁。那么你为什么要这样做呢？然后我得编个故事来解释它应该如何发展。所以回到我最初说的联邦基金市场已经死了。没有人交易它。我们应该直接交易贴现窗口。对。贴现率应该是我整天都在借贷。我可以留下超额准备金。对。如果我有钱可以提供，当我需要钱时，我可以从贴现窗口借钱。而且应该有一个五基点的更好的报价。如果你这样做，你会向系统注入更多流动性，从而以很好的方式促进经济增长。但他们就像抹去了**LIBOR**一样。他们通过所有的LCR抹去了联邦基金，你知道，贴现率的概念，只是贴现率的买卖报价，然后突然之间贴现窗口就变成了正确的交易方式。它正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So in theory, because let's imagine somebody drew on the fed. So the discount window is regional fed. Let's assume somebody took down 100 billion from the or even 20 billion from the discount window through the Cleveland Fed kind of levy PNC. So the people can figure out who it is. So why are you doing that? And then I got a story and I got to explain it where I think this should go. So go back to the original where I said fed funds is dead. Nobody trades it. We ought to just trade the discount window. Right. The discount rate ought to be. I'm just lending and borrowing all day long. I can leave money excess reserves. Right. If I have money to give and I can borrow money discount window when I need money. And there ought to be like a five basis point. Better offer on that. You'd put more liquidity into the system here to grow the economy if you did that. You know, in a great way. But it's like they wiped out LIBOR. They wiped out fed funds through all their LCR from the, you know, the idea of the discount rate, just bet offer on the discount rate and then all of a sudden discount window becomes right way transaction. It's happening.

### 稳定币与加密货币监管

**Joe Weisenthal**: 所以您得原谅我，因为现在世界上发生了很多事情。所以我不能关注所有事情。我不知道您对**有息稳定币**的立场，我理解这是这个领域的一个大问题，一个争论。我再次，我一直在关注其他事情，但我看到关于这个的头条新闻不断出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So you have to forgive me because there's a lot going on in the world today. So I can't pay attention to everything. I have no idea where you stand on a yield bearing stablecoins, which I understand to be a big thing, debate in the sector. And I'm again, I have I've been paying attention to other things, but I see headlines about this pop up.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。所以**稳定币立法**，天才般的立法出台了。他们留下了一个小漏洞。他们说没有利息，但通过提供奖励、促销活动来规避了。现在正在讨论的是《**清晰法案**》（Clarity Act）。他们正试图堵住这个漏洞。他们指的是银行和银行周围的人。而**加密货币**行业则希望保持这个漏洞开放。为什么不呢？如果你能支付利息，它就会推动交易量。银行希望支付利息。我不希望你支付利息，因为你可能会从这个系统中吸走存款，而且你正在扰乱已经运作了250年的资本系统。你确定要扰乱它吗？归根结底，我认为稳定币被构建、推出和营销为一种支付机制。它在某种程度上，顺便说一句，我不确定它是否会，但它会使支付更容易、更快、更便宜等等。而不是作为一种投资工具。对吧？投资工具是不同的事物，需要不同的监管。所以突然之间，像一个购买**美国国库券**并支付利息的稳定币。在我看来，这非常像一个**货币市场基金**。那没关系。如果它是一个货币市场基金，那就像货币市场基金一样监管它。不能让银行破产。你必须手头有足够的流动性。所有相关的披露规则。然后你想怎么做就怎么做。去支付人们和货币市场基金。我只是觉得他们把事情混淆了。而且我认为，我未经证实的担忧是，我们还没有在加密货币领域彻底引爆。对。它是在你学习这些东西的过程中，时断时续地发生。我们为什么需要一次性启动所有东西呢？让我们先弄清楚一些事情。如果它有效，并且有逻辑去做，那么以后再做。我只是不知道你是否需要一次性做所有事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So, stablecoin legislation, genius that comes out. They left a little loophole in there. They said no interest, but it kind of got run around by offering rewards, promos, same thing. Clarity act is what's being debated right now. They're trying to close that loophole. They being kind of banks and people around banks. Keeping the loophole open as crypto. You know, why not. If you can pay interest it's going to drive volume. I want to pay interest banks. I don't want you to pay interest because you're going to potentially suck deposits out of this system, and you're messing around with the capital system that's worked for 250 years. You sure you want to mess with it? You know, at the end of the day, I think of I think the following stablecoin has been built, launched, marketed as a payment mechanism. It's somehow. And by the way, I'm not sure it will, but, you know, it's going to make payments easier, faster, cheaper, whatever. Not as an investment vehicle. Right? An investment vehicle is a different animal and needs different regulation. So all a sudden like a stablecoin this by T-bills that pays you interest. That looks an awful lot like a money fund to me. That's fine. If it's a money fund, then regulate it like a money fund. Can't break the bank. You got to have this much liquidity on hand. You know, all the disclosure rules that go around with it. Then do what you want with it. You know, go ahead and pay people and money funds. I just think they're mixing things. And I think, you know, my, my uninformed worry is we're not done blowing up in crypto yet. Right. It's in fits and starts as you learn these things. Why do we need to start everything at once. Let's figure some stuff out. If it works and there's a logic to doing it then go ahead and do it later. I just I don't know that you need to do it all at once.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 着什么急？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What's the rush? Yeah.

</details>

### 巴塞尔协议III终局提案

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们即将迎来**超级碗**。当我想到超级碗时，我总是想到**巴塞尔协议III终局提案**以及他们在2024年发布的广告。那真是，不是吗？那是一个非常有效的营销工具，至少对我来说是这样。我们正在等待终局提案。您认为原始文件或建议与现在之间可能会有什么变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You know, we are coming up to, the Super Bowl. And when I think of Super Bowl, I always think of, the basil and game proposals and that ad that they ran in 2024. It, it was a real, wasn't it? It was a very effective marketing tool, at least for me. And we are expecting a proposal, of the end game. What's your sense of what might change between, you know, the original document or suggestions versus now?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 我对此没有任何内部信息。但是，最初的提案是蔑视数学的。他们基本上设定了一个提高资本的目标，然后使用了错误的数学方法来达到这个结果，这就是很多愤怒的来源。因为如果你开始制定规则和资本分配，你就会无意中在不应该出现的地方引发风险。所以我认为数学问题已经解决了。关于**压力测试**的诉讼以及模型需要公开的事实。所以他们衡量的数学会好很多。你听说过将一些分数与通货膨胀和一些边界挂钩。我不知道他们会对**操作风险资本**做什么。那一直是一个争议。我认为他们会在**信用风险评级**上给予一些信用，这是欧洲给予而我们没有的。我猜里面会有些东西让每个人都满意，然后每个人又会集体对某些事情感到失望。他们不会完全放弃，但他们会努力使其方向正确，并基于真实的数学，而不是凭空捏造的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: I have no insight information on that. But, the original proposal that was written was in contempt of math. They basically they had a goal of raising capital, and then they used bad math to cause that outcome, which was a lot of what the outrage was over because if you start making up rules and capital allocation, you inadvertently cause risk to emerge in places that shouldn't. So I think the math is fixed. You know, the lawsuit on the stress test and the in the fact the models need to be public. So the math is going to be a lot better on what they measure. You've heard about indexing some scores to inflation and some of the boundaries. I don't know what they're going to do on operated risk capital. That's been a fight. I think they're going to give some credit on credit risk ratings that Europe gives that we don't. And my guess is there'll be something in there for everybody, and then everybody will collectively be disappointed about something. They're not going to give away the shot, but they're going to try to make it directionally correct and based on real math, instead of made up stuff.

### AI与技术栈现代化

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我想回到您之前关于银行整合的说法，您实际上给出了一个非常罕见的，我想说是2026年**生成式AI**应用的真实案例，您提到当地银行网点的人员可以询问政策并学习，所以那不仅仅是一个假设。那是现在正在发生的事情。是的，那是真的。您能谈谈吗？这是我们最近在播客上一直在讨论的一个主题，就是不仅仅是AI本身或实施AI。我们要实施AI，而是公司与软件供应商之间关系的变化，AI是否改变了这些关系？您是否有优势，因为有些特定的利基功能您可以自己构建？您能谈谈您在公司内部看到这些事情如何发展吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I want to go back to something you said about the bank integration, and you actually gave a very rare, I would say, actual 2026 application of, generative AI implementation, where you mentioned that the person at the local bank branch can actually, like ask a question about the policies and learn so that that wasn't just a hypothetical. That's a real thing that's happening right now. Yeah. That's real. Can you talk? This is a theme that's been we've been talking about on the, podcast lately, which is, you know, not just AI per se or implementing AI. We're going to like implement AI, but like, you know, the changing relationship between a company and their software vendors and, you know, does AI change some of these relationships? Do you have leverage because there are certain, like niche functions that you could, like, build yourself? Can you talk a little bit about how you're seeing some of these things play out within your firm?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的，这很有趣，因为有太多更好的信息。这方面很棒。所以从基础开始。为了利用**AI**，你需要**干净的数据**。将数据定义为单一事实来源。我们为此花费了十年时间和巨额财富。所以，听起来可能很傻，但想想一家公司内部有多少不同的地方可能有一个支票账户余额，它被转换成七天内的平均支票账户余额，或者中位数，或者这个那个。所以当有人试图提取数据来运行报告或构建模型时，他们甚至不知道他们提取的是什么真实数据。所以你必须在基础源和索引处清理数据。然后你就会知道你是否有能力构建模型，无论是大型语言模型还是分析模型。有现成的**开放模型**你可以直接使用，这就是我们倾向于用来构建文档分类的方法。我们正在使用我们自己的数据，我们自己的文档。我不需要他们的数据。我也不需要重新训练他们的模型，除了在我自己的数据上运行它，这是一个小得多的计算工厂，对吧？我没有把整个互联网都下载下来。我只有这个东西。然后一旦我们训练了模型，运行模型不需要大量的计算，训练模型才需要大量的计算。当我们谈论实施AI时，有些是花哨的东西。我要实施**Copilot**。现在人们可以替我写电子邮件了。每个人都知道我的电子邮件是Copilot写的，因为它太客气了，而且标点符号都正确。这能为我们赚到钱吗？可能不会，但它很酷。是的，所以当你听到大多数人说没有理由，他们只是插入了Copilot，每年支付2000万美元的许可证费用。它开始发挥作用的地方是当它能为我们的员工或客户快速回答问题，以及它能以同样的方式自动化流程。我们已经进行了20年的自动化之旅，对吧？从互联网开始，然后是微服务和应用程序。AI只是下一个阶段。在过去十年中，我们可能在运营环境中获得了30%的生产力效率提升，实际上是过去七年。AI将再给我们带来30%的提升，而且会随着时间推移而实现。但把它看作是一种自动化。它就是这样。即使人们谈论AI，他们也会说，哦，发送电子邮件。那不是AI模型，它只是一个**决策树**。它正在自动化一个脚本中的答案，以一种人们不需要来回切换的方式移动数据，这都是相当基础的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah, this is fun because there's so much better information. Great about that. So start with the basics. In order to utilize a, you need clean data. Define data with a single source of truth. We've spent ten years doing that in a fortune. So, you know, as silly as that sounds, I think how many different places inside of a company you might have, you know, a checking account balance that's in morphed into the average checking account balance over seven days, or the median or the this or the that. And so when someone's trying to pull data to run a report or build a model, they don't even know what the real, they don't even know what they're pulling. So you got to get it clean at the base source and an index. Then you're going to know you have the capacity to build a model, whether it's large language or analytical, like large language models. There's open models out there you can just use, which is what we tend to do to build our document sorting. We're using it on our own data, our own documents. I don't need their data. And I don't need to retrain their model per se, other than running it on my own data, which is a much smaller compute factory, right? I don't have the whole internet down there and downloaded. I just got this thing right. And then once we train the model, running the model doesn't take a lot of compute training. The model takes a lot of compute. When we implement talk about AI, some of it's the the fancy object thing. I'm going to implement Copilot. And now people can write emails for me. Everybody knows when copilot wrote my email because it's way too polite and the punctuation is correct. Does that make us any money? Probably not, you know, but it's cool. And yeah, that's so when you hear most people say no reason, I they just plugged in copilot and paid somebody 20 million bucks a year for licenses where it starts to make a difference is when it can answer questions in a hurry for our employees or our clients, and where it can automate process the same way. We've been on this automation journey for 20 years now, right? Starting with internet and then kind of microservices and applications. AI is just the next stage of that. You know, we've got we over the last ten years probably get 30 points of productivity efficiency in our operating environments, really last seven years, actually, AI is going to give us another 30 and it's going to come through time. But it's think of it as a automation. All it is is even when people talk about AI, they'll say, oh, you know, send an email. It's not an AI model, it's just a decision tree. You know, it's automating a script in an answer, moving data in a way where somebody doesn't have to swivel, you know, pretty basic stuff.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么在承保方面呢？您会使用AI来自动化那个特定的流程吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What about on underwriting? Would you use AI to automate that particular process?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 实际上今天法律不允许这样做。所以有一些法律，我的意思是，是《**贷款真相法案**》（Truth in Lending）之类的法律，如果你申请信用卡，他们只是把我的利率保持在10%。所以我说不，我必须给你三个理由，说明我为什么说不。使用AI模型，我们会查看一千个变量，每个变量的权重取决于它们的交互作用和你的特定档案。所以租金的权重对一个人可能非常重，而对另一个人则不然。根据档案，我不能给你三个理由。模型告诉我不行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: It's actually not legally allowed today. So the there's. I mean, it's truth in lending or something, you know, 1 or 1 of these laws where if I tell you, you know, you applied for your credit card, they just kept my rates at 10%. So I said, no, I've got to give you the three reasons you know, of why I said no. With an AI model, we look at a thousand variables, and the weight of each of those variables is dependent upon their interaction and your particular profile. So the weight of rent might be very heavy for one person and not for another. Based on the profile, I can't give you three reasons. The model told me no.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，模型告诉我行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, the model told me yes.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所以今天在信贷决策中最终发生的事情很疯狂，但它有效。我们会用我们正常的标准来设定，比如债务收入比，以及你查看的其他任何东西，我们会说“是”或“否”。然后如果我们说“不”，我们会使用AI来尝试告诉你“是”。因为我仍然可以使用我最初的借口说“不”，但如果我后来让你说“是”，你就不会生我的气。所以这很疯狂。但关键是，从法律上讲，如果你说“不”，你必须能够阐明一个理由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So what ends up happening today in credit decisions? This is crazy. But it works is we'll set with our normal criteria this like this debt to income, you know, whatever else you look at, we'll say yes or no. And then if we tell, you know, we use AI to try to tell you. Yes. Because I can still use my original excuses. No, but if I turn, you say yes after the fact. You're not mad at me. So it's. It's crazy. But the point is that, legally speaking, if you say no, you have to be able to articulate a reason.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 所以最终发生的事情是每个人都把这个标准设定得太高了。这是需要审视的愚蠢规则之一。我的意思是，我们确实使用。它不完全是AI。有很多关于自动化的**决策树模型**有助于承保。但它不一定是**机器学习**应用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So what ends up happening is everybody sets this bar way too high. This is the one of these silly rules that needs to be, looked at. I mean, we we do use. It's not so much AI. There's a lot of decision tree models on automation that help with underwriting. But it's not necessarily a machine learning application.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **Tracy**，我的意思是，我发现我非常直观地理解AI作为另一种形式的**工作流自动化**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Tracing. I mean, I find I get this idea of, like, AI as another form of workflow automation. Very intuitive.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。**Tracy**和我过去常常发布播客的文字稿，但这是一个非常劳动密集型的过程，需要清理等等。所以我以为AI会是万能药。它就像清理这段文本。只是当我们做的时候，它还没有达到那个水平。它会创造虚假的句子，创造不存在的句子。但我理解这种直觉，即AI可以被训练来执行可重复的流程。现在，我们称之为大型语言模型的那些工作流自动化，是否有某些工作流自动化流程是五年前我们无法自动化，而现在可以的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yes. Tracy and I used to, publish transcripts of the podcast, but it was a very labor intensive, labor intensive process to, like, clean it up, etc.. And so I thought, like I was going to be the panacea. It's like clean this text. It just when we were doing it, it wasn't there yet. It was like creating fake. It was creating sentences that weren't there. But I understand this intuition that I can then be like trained on a repeatable process right now. And again, the things that we call I would do days, large language models, those workflow automations like are they are there certain workflow automations that today workflow processes that you could say we've been able to automate them in a way we couldn't have five years ago?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 哦，绝对有。绝对有。但让我给你们一些范围和数字，以及实际发生的情况。我们的技术栈相当干净。所以我们可能在这方面比一些人领先一点。但我们专注于在我们的客服中心和运营环境中，可寻址支出达到了14亿美元。这只是为客户解决问题，处理所有这些事情。我们已经想出了171种不同的方式来使用AI来减少这14亿美元的可寻址支出，我们认为大概可以减少40%。在这171个用例中，我们优先选择了五个正在运行的。那么，其中一个用例是什么样的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. But let me let me just give you kind of some scope and some numbers and what's actually happening. And I we have a pretty clean tech stack. So maybe we're a little further ahead at this than, than some. But we have we focused on a billion, four of addressable spend inside of our care centers, in our operating environments. This is just solving problems for customers, moving all that stuff. A billion for we spend we've come up with a 171 different ways to use AI in reducing that spend and the addressable piece of the billion for, we think probably 40% of it. Of the 171 use cases, we prioritize, five that are live. And so what is you know, what is one of those look like, for example?

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 比如，在我们的财富管理业务中，我们有很多信托律师。我的祖父，实际上是通过**PNC**，创建了这个小小的跨代信托，它写得很漂亮，是手写的，大约三页。也许是我的曾祖父。每个月都有律师需要查看这份文件，然后说，这符合条件或不符合条件，或者我们要进行这次分配。所有这些都是手动的。现在只需将它们读入**文档编写器**，所有这些数百万页信托文件的机械结果都会呈现在你面前。对。在这个日期付款。受益人，它只是让事情变得非常简单。所以**文档阅读**，文档内容的表达以及基本的东西。我不需要去搜索和查找，也不需要担心人为错误。这些东西会带来改变。我担心过度关注那些酷炫有趣的玩具，比如**ChatGPT**。我的意思是，这就像一个新的**谷歌搜索**。它只是提供答案，如果仅仅用于此，它不会让世界变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: So imagine, inside of our wealth business, you know, we got a bunch of trust lawyers. So my grandfather, it's actually with PNC. My grandfather created this small little trust skip generations and it's written it's beautiful. It's for handwritten on, like three pages. Maybe it was my great grandfather. Some lawyer every month has to look at that thing and say, you know, this qualifies or doesn't or we're going to do this distribution. All of those things are manual. Now just read them into the document writer and all of the things that are mechanical outcomes from those millions of pages of trust documents are right in front of you. Right. Payment on this date here. The beneficiaries, it just it makes it real simple. So document reading expression of what's in documents and the basic stuff. You know no I don't have to just go and search and find and human error. That that stuff will make a difference. I worry with too much focus on the cool, fun toy. ChatGPT. I mean, this is, you know, it's a new Google search. It's called. Give me the answer that that isn't going to make the world better if that's all it's used for.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你们是如何获得一个干净的**技术栈**的？因为这与银行整合也息息相关。你总是听说银行最终会有一堆混乱的技术系统，其中一些可能包括**COBOL**或旧语言之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How did you get a clean tech stack? Because this is something that also goes hand in hand with bank consolidation. You always hear that, you know, banks end up with this tangled mess of technological systems, maybe some that include, cobble or like old languages and things like that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **COBOL**，我总是记不住。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: COBOL, I can never. Remember can't even. Yeah.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 你出生的时候我们还在用COBOL编程呢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: You weren't even born yet when we were programing and COBOL.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么你们是如何管理的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So how do you so how do. You manage so.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 老实说，就在金融危机中期。我们与**National City**合并，双方都承受着压力。这有点像一场监管下的联姻。我们双方都没有能力运营一家更大的公司。我清楚地记得，我当时对合并后的组织说，我们必须重新思考如何运营，你不能再通过四处走动来管理了。而且双方的技术栈都无法独立生存。所以我们节省的钱比我们在公告中说的要少。或者说，我们确实节省了我们说会节省的钱。但我们悄悄地每年再投资20亿美元，持续了十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Honest answer right in the middle of the financial crisis. Right. We merged with National City under duress from both firms. Kind of a regulatory wedding. Neither of us had the capacity to run a larger firm. I mean, I distinctly remember, you know, talking to the combined organization, we have to rethink how we run something you can't manage by walking around anymore. And neither tech stack could survive on its own. And so we saved less money than we said we would in the announcement. Or actually, we saved what we said we would save. But quietly, we reinvested 2 billion bucks a year for ten years.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wow.

</details>

**Bill Demchak**: 是的。所以字面上都是全新的。我们从单服务器堆栈，比如**Apple**，你知道，这台电脑运行那个应用程序，每台电脑都不同，因为应用程序所有者那天和**戴尔**或第二天和**惠普**共进晚餐。是的，我们有11个数据中心。没有一个是在虚拟环境中。所以我们首先构建了自己的**云环境**，然后其次，用**云语言**编写所有东西，采用**微服务应用程序**。所以它是**云原生**的。这需要永远。但我们投入了大量的资金，并且一直在投资、投资、投资，最终达到了我们的技术栈像任何你能在外面找到的金融科技公司一样现代化的程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Demchak**: Yeah. So literally all new. We went from single server stack Apple, you know, so this computer runs that application and each computer is different because whoever the application owner was went to dinner with Dell that day or HP the next day. Yeah, we had 11 data centers. None of it was in a virtual environment. So building our own, first cloud environment and then secondly, writing everything in cloud language in a microservice application. So it's cloud native. That's forever. But we spent a ton of dough and just have invested, invested, invested, and got to a place where our tech stack is as modern as any fintech you'll find out there.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Conversation. We had a lot in that. But I, I just want to keep going. There are so many interesting angles. Bill actually answer the questions. Which is cannot be said for every seat. You know, I would say most of our guests are very good at answering questions. Not every CEO is great at always answering questions. But I was like, oh, I'm like learning something with each one of these things. Let's keep. Going.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 而且，他似乎对运营银行的细致实际方面有很好的把握。所以我对他们如何在金融危机后重新设计技术栈非常感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Also, genuinely, he seemed to have a good handle on like the granular practical aspects. I know running a bank. So I was really interested to hear how they redesigned their tech.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。我想他们比其他人抢先了一步。然后还有抵押品在贴现窗口的预先放置，我知道美联储一直在鼓励银行这样做。我没有意识到你必须发送实际的抵押贷款文件。如果你以这些为抵押借款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. After the financial crisis, I guess they got a head start on everyone else. And then also the pre-positioning of collateral at the discount window, I knew that the fed had been encouraging banks to do it. I did not realize that you had to send the actual mortgage docs. If you borrow against those.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 令人惊讶的是，有多少事情不是自动、电子完成的。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It is crazy how much is not just done automatically, electronically. Right?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我没有问，但我本来想问**区块链**是否能解决这个问题？但这个想法是，所有这些东西实际上都是电子化的，尽管显然有物理组成部分，但这个想法是，这里有一些理论上可以货币化的东西，它具有流动价值，是一种流动性工具。但由于系统结构的方式，如果它没有预先放置，就不能立即清算或转换为流动资产。这对我来说仍然有点不可思议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And here was I didn't ask it, but I was going to ask does blockchain solve this question? But the idea that like, okay, all of these things really are electronic ish, although there's clearly this physical component, but the idea that here is something which is theoretically monetizable, which has liquid value is a liquid instrument. But because of the way that the system is structured cannot actually be liquidated or turned into liquid assets immediately if it had were not pre-positioned. It's sort of a that actually does still seem a little bit wild to me that that is the case.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我一直认为抵押贷款转让是区块链的一个用例，对吧？

**Tracy Alloway**: I always thought that mortgage assignations were like one use case for blockchain, right?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，是的。你可以合理地看到区块链在这方面有所帮助，而不是，我不知道，追踪生菜的来源。这总是显得有点荒谬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, yeah. You could reasonably see blockchain, you know, helping out with that problem versus, I don't know, tracking the origins of lettuce. And it's like it always seemed kind of ridiculous.

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，这似乎是银行业中的一件事，而且再次，就像集成数据库一样。所以会有一个中央银行数据库。会有一个住房贷款银行数据库和一个区域银行和一个银行数据库。对。问题是，为什么它们不能互相交流呢？

<details>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well it seems like one of these things which is in banking and again is like integrated databases. So there's like a be a central bank database. There will be a home loan bank database and the regional bank and the bank database. Right. And the question is like, why can't they just all.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 互相交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Talk to. Each other.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 查看数据库的相关部分。对。我想这说起来容易做起来难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: See the relevant parts of the database. Right. And I suppose that's easier said than done.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我真的很喜欢听他谈论AI的实际应用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I really like hearing him talk to you about practical applications of AI.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。这再次感觉与我们去年的一些对话有所不同，或者说现在有更多关于AI作为一种**节省劳动力**或**节省时间**的技术的明确例子。所以这是我们认为在2026年需要更多关注的另一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Which again, maybe feels a little different than some of our conversations last year, or it feels like now there's more articulated examples of being, of this as a sort of labor saving or time saving technology. So that's another thing I think we have to pay more attention to in 2026.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，我们就到这里吧？
