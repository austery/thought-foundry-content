### 硅谷的创新哲学与AI投资框架

这实际上是人们对**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 位于美国加利福尼亚州北部，是全球高科技产业的中心）不了解的一点。你总是从“你能突然创造出什么惊人的东西？”这个问题开始。许多公司，当你问他们“你的商业模式是什么？”时，他们会说：“我不知道。”他们会说：“是的，我们会努力解决，但我能在这里创造出一些惊人的东西。”而这实际上是**硅谷**的核心理念，也可以说是它的“宗教”和知识体系，我非常热爱、钦佩并身体力行。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This is actually one of the things that I think people don't realize about Silicon Valley. You start with what's the amazing thing that you can suddenly create. Lots of these companies and you go, "What's your business model?" They go, "I don't know." They're like, "Yeah, we're going to try to work it out, but I can create something amazing here." And that's actually one of the fundamental, call it the religion of Silicon Valley and the knowledge of Silicon Valley that I so much love and admire and embody.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Re welcome podcast.</p>
</details>

Reid: 很高兴来到这里。Reed，你是那个时代最成功的**Web 2**（Web 2.0: 指互联网的第二个发展阶段，强调用户生成内容、可用性和互操作性）投资者之一。你知道，**Facebook**、**LinkedIn**（你显然是联合创始人）、**Airbnb**，还有许多其他公司。你有一些帮助你成功的框架，其中之一就是我们经常谈论和喜爱的**七宗罪**（Seven Deadly Sins: 一种投资框架，利用人类的普遍欲望来识别商业机会）。当你考虑**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）投资时，你采用什么样的框架或世界观？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's great to be here. So Reed, you're one of the most successful web 2 investors of of that era. You know, Facebook, uh, LinkedIn obviously, which you co-created, Airbnb, many, many others. And you had several frameworks that helped you do that. One of which was the seven deadly sins, which we talk about often and love. As you're thinking about AI investing, what what's a framework or worldview that you take to your AI investing?</p>
</details>

Reid: 显然，我们都像透过一块暗玻璃，透过一片迷雾，伴随着难以理解的频闪灯光，所以我们都在探索这个新宇宙。因此，我不知道我是否像Christopher一样拥有**七宗罪**，但它仍然有效，因为这是一个关于跨越全球80亿以上人口的心理基础设施的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously we're all looking through a glass darkly looking through a fog with strobe lights that don't really you know are hard to understand what's going on. So we're all navigating this new this new universe. So I don't don't know if I have as Christopher but the seven deadly sins still work because that's a question of what is infrastruct psychological infrastructure across all 8 billion plus human beings.</p>
</details>

>> 但我想有几点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But I'd say there's a couple things.</p>
</details>

Reid: 首先，会有一些显而易见的东西，比如聊天机器人、生产力工具、编码辅助等等。顺便说一句，这些仍然值得投资，但显而易见意味着对每个人都显而易见，所以进行差异化投资会更难。第二个领域是，这意味着什么？因为人们在颠覆性领域常常说一切都会改变，而不是说重要的东西会改变。就像你提到**Web 2**和**LinkedIn**，显然，随着平台的变化，你会想，现在是否有可能因为**AI**而出现新的**LinkedIn**？鉴于我的背景，我当然希望**LinkedIn**能成为那样，但你知道，无论如何，我总是支持创新、创业和对人类最有利的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is um there is going to be a set of things that are the kind of the obvious line of sight obvious line of sight bunch of stuff with chat bots bunch of stuff productivity coding assistance you know da d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d and so and by the way that's still worth investing in but obviously obvious line of sight means it's obvious to everybody line of sight and so so you know uh doing a differential investment is harder. The second area is well what does this mean because too often people say in an area of disruption that everything changes as opposed to significant things change. So like you were mentioning web 2 and LinkedIn and and obviously you know part of this with a platform change you go okay well are there now new LinkedIns that are possible because of AI or something like that and obviously given my own heritage I would love LinkedIn to be that but you know it's it's whatever I'm always pro innovation entrepreneurship best possible thing for humanity</p>
</details>

>> 但像那些更传统的东西，比如没有改变的**网络效应**（Network Effects: 产品或服务的价值随用户数量增加而增长的现象）、企业集成，以及其他一些新的平台会打乱现有秩序，但你仍然会以某种方式将这些秩序重新整合起来。那会是什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but like what are the kind of more traditional like the kind of things that haven't changed network effects you know enterprise integration you other kinds of things that that the new platform um upsets the apple cart, but you're still going to be putting that apple cart kind of back together in some way. And what is that?</p>
</details>

Reid: 然后第三点，可能是我投入最多时间的地方，就是我所认为的**硅谷**盲点。因为我们**硅谷**往往是世界上最令人惊叹的地方之一。这里有一个充满激烈**竞合**（Coopetition: 竞争与合作并存的关系）、学习、发明、构建新事物等的网络，这非常棒。但我们也有自己的局限，有自己的盲点。对我们来说，一个典型的盲点往往是——好吧，一切都应该用计算机科学来完成，一切都应该用软件来完成，一切都应该用比特来完成。这是最相关的事情，因为顺便说一句，这是一个很好的投资领域。但是，我想的是，**AI**革命将在哪些领域展现出魔力，但又不在**硅谷**的盲点之内？这可能是我投入大部分共同创立、发明和投资时间的地方。因为我认为，通常一个非常大的盲点正是那种你可以长期发展，创造出另一个标志性公司的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third um which is probably where I've been putting most of my time has been what I think of as Silicon Valley blind spots because what we tend to be like Silicon Valley is is one of the most amazing places in the world. there's a network of intense coopetition, learning, you know, invention, you know, kind of uh building new things, etc., which is just great. But we also have our cannons. We have our kind of blind spots. And a classic one for us tends to be um well, everything should be done in CS, everything should be done software, everything should be done in bits. And that's the most relevant thing because by the way, it's a great area to invest. Um, but it was like, okay, what are the areas where the AI revolution will be magical but won't be within the Silicon Valley blind spots? And that's probably where I've been putting the majority of my co-founding time, invention time, um, you know, kind of investment time, etc. Because like I think usually a blind spot on something that's very very big.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Reid: 对，这正是那种你会觉得“好吧，你有一条很长的跑道来创造一些可能成为另一个标志性公司的东西”的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. is precisely the kinds of things that you go, okay, you have a a long runway to create something that could be like another one of the iconic companies.</p>
</details>

### AI在药物发现与“原子世界”的机遇

>> 是的。让我们深入探讨一下，因为我们之前也在谈论人们如何过于关注生产力方面和工作流程方面，却忽略了其他元素。请多谈谈你现在觉得更有趣的其他方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Let's go deeper on that because we were also talking just just before this about how people focus so much on the productivity side, the workflow sides, but they're missing other other elements or so. Say more about other other things that you find more interesting now.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，所以，我在2015年，也就是大约十年前，告诉我在**Greylock**（Greylock Partners: 一家知名的风险投资公司）的合伙人之一，我说：“听着，**AI**在生产力方面会有很多不同的应用。我会帮忙的，对吧？”比如，你知道，如果你有需要我合作的公司，那太棒了。你知道，企业生产力等等，这些都是**Greylock**擅长的领域。但我实际上说，我认为这里正在出现的盲点，也会有一些像你们都知道的**Manifold Bio**（Manifold Bio: 一家利用 AI 进行药物发现的公司）这样的东西，它致力于如何创建一个以软件速度运作的药物发现工厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so um so one of the things I, you know, kind of told my partners back at Greylock in 2015, so it's like 10 years ago, um was I said, "Look, there's going to be a bunch of different things on productivity around AI. Um I'll help, right?" Like, you know, I'll you know, you have uh companies you want me to to work with that you're doing. Great. That's awesome. You know, enterprise productivity, etc. You know, things that Greylock tends to specialize on. But I said actually in fact what I think that's here getting the blind spots is um is also going to be some things like you know what you know as you guys both know Mattis AI um which is how do we create a drug discovery factory that works at the speed of software</p>
</details>

>> 当然，现在有监管问题，有生物学方面的比特，当然还有其他问题，所以它不会纯粹是软件的速度，但我们如何做到这一点？他们说：“哦，那你对生物学了解多少？”答案是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right now obviously there's regulatory obviously there's biological bits obviously d and so there's it won't be purely a speed of software but how do we do this And they said, "Oh, well, what do you know about biology?" And the answer is</p>
</details>

Reid: 零。好吧，也许不完全是零。你知道，我已经在**Biohub**（Chan Zuckerberg Biohub: 一个致力于基础生物医学研究的非营利组织）董事会任职十年了，我还在**Arc**（Arc Institute: 一个专注于生物医学研究的非营利机构）董事会等等。我一直在思考**原子世界与比特世界**（Worlds of Atoms and Worlds of Bits: 分别指物理世界和数字世界）的交集。而生物比特在某些方面介于**原子世界**和**比特世界**之间。我一直在深入思考这个问题，以及那些能够提升人类生活的事物，你知道，那种以人为本的关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> zero. Well, it maybe not quite zero. You know, been on the board of Biohub for 10 years. I'm on the board of Arc, etc. Like, I've been thinking about the intersection of the worlds of atoms and the worlds of bits. And you have biological bits which are kind of halfway between atoms and bits in various ways. I've been thinking about this a lot and kind of what the things are, not so much with a specific company focus as much as a what are things that elevate human life, you know, kind of focus.</p>
</details>

Reid: 这也是**Biohub**和**Arc**存在的部分原因。但后来我想，等等，现在有了**AI**，你就有了加速。因为，举个例子，这个插曲会很有趣。大约十年前，我被邀请去**斯坦福大学长期规划委员会**（Stanford Long-Term Planning Commission: 斯坦福大学的一个规划机构）做一次演讲。我告诉他们，他们应该基本上把所有的精力都投入到为每个学科开发**AI**工具上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">part of the reason why Biohub, part of the reason why ARC um but then I was like well wait a minute actually now with AI and you have the acceleration because like for example um actually this detour will be fun. Um so roughly also around 10 years ago I was asked to give a uh a talk to the Stanford Long-Term Planning Commission and um what I told them uh was that they should uh basically divert and and put all of their energy into AI tools for every single discipline.</p>
</details>

>> 这远在**ChatGPT**和所有其他东西出现之前。我使用的比喻是搜索比喻，因为想想看，如果你在每个学科都有一个定制的搜索生产力工具。当时，我能想象到，除了理论数学或理论物理学，我能为每个学科构建一个。今天，你甚至可能能够做理论数学和理论物理学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And this is well before chat GBT and all the rest. And the metaphor I used was a search metaphor because think if you had a custom search productivity tool in every single discipline. Now back then I could imagine it I could build one for every discipline other than theoretical math or theoretical physics. Today you might even be able to do theoretical math and theoretical physics.</p>
</details>

Reid: 对。没错。所以这样做可以改变知识的生成、知识的交流和知识的分析。现在，同样的事情，我们现在在想，生物系统仍然过于复杂，无法模拟。我们有了**大型语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models: 一种深度学习模型，能够理解和生成人类语言）这些惊人的东西，但经典的**硅谷**盲点是，哦，我们只要把它全部放入模拟中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Exactly. And so do that like transform knowledge generation, knowledge communication, knowledge analysis. Well, that kind of same thing now thinking, well, well, the biological system is still too complex to simulate. We've got all these amazing things with LLMs, but like the classic Silicon Valley blind spot is, oh, we'll just put it all in simulation</p>
</details>

>> 然后药物就会自动产生，对吧？那个模拟是困难的。现在，你从**AlphaFold**（AlphaFold: DeepMind 开发的蛋白质结构预测 AI 系统）和**AlphaZero**（AlphaZero: DeepMind 开发的通用棋类 AI 系统）的工作中开始看到的部分洞察是，因为人们只是认为，啊，物理材料需要**量子计算**（Quantum Computing: 利用量子力学现象进行计算的新型计算模式）。现在，**量子计算**可以做非常惊人的事情，但实际上，仅仅进行预测并使其预测正确，顺便说一句，它不必100%正确。它只需要1%正确，因为你可以验证其他99%不正确，然后找到那一个正确的东西。所以，这字面上就像，它不是大海捞针。它就像在太阳系中找一根针，对吧？但这有可能做到。这就是导致**硅谷**经典地认为“我们会把它全部放入模拟中，然后它就会解决问题”的部分原因。不，那行不通。或者，哦，不，我们将拥有一个超级智能的药物研究员，那将在两年内实现。我实际上认为，也许有一天，但不是很快。对吧？所以，无论如何，这就是在其他不同领域发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and drugs will fall out, right? That simulation is difficult. Now part of the insight that you begin to see from like the work with alpha you know glow and alpha zero is because like people just think ah physical material is going to take quantum muning. Now quantum computing could do really amazing things but actually simply doing prediction and getting that prediction right and by the way it doesn't have to be right 100% of the time. It has to be right like 1% of the time because you can validate the other 99% weren't w were right and then finding that one thing. And so literally it's like it's not a needle in a hay stack. It's like a needle in a solar system, right? And it's like but you could possibly do that. And that's part of what led to like okay Silicon Valley will classically go we'll put it all in simulation and that will solve it. Nope, that's not going to work. Or oh no, we're going to have a super intelligent drug researcher and that will be two years down the thing. I actually look maybe someday, not soon. Right? So anyway, that was the kind of thing that was the the the in other different areas.</p>
</details>

### AI对专业领域的影响：以医生为例

Reid: 现在，其中一部分也是，你知道，很多人实际上没有意识到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, part of it's also um you know, kind of uh what a lot of people don't realize actually</p>
</details>

>> 如果我没有说太久，我会讲我给的另一个例子，因为你会喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> if I'm not going too long I'll go I'll go to the other example that that I gave because you'll love this.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，这会呼应我们10到15年前的一些对话。所以，我正在为本周日的一场辩论做准备，辩论的主题是**AI**是否会在几年内取代所有医生。支持方的论点非常简单，那就是我们拥有大规模增长的能力。如果你看看今天的**ChatGPT**，你会发现，举个例子，给所有听众的建议是，如果你没有将**ChatGPT**或同等工具作为第二意见来使用，那你简直是疯了。你很无知。当你得到一个严重的诊断结果时，把它作为第二意见来检查。顺便说一句，如果它有分歧，那就去寻求第三意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um this will echo some of our conversations from 101 15 years ago. Um so um I am prepping for a debate about on Sunday this week on whether or not AIS will replace all doctors in a small number of years. Now the procase is very easy which is we have massively increasing capabilities. If you look at chat GBT today, um you'd go like for example, advice to everyone who's listening to this, if you're not using chat GBT or equivalent as a second opinion, you're out of your mind. You're ignorant. You get a serious result. Check it as a second opinion. And by the way, if it diverse, then go get a third.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，所以诊断能力，这些是比地球上任何人类都更好的知识库。所以，你会说，如果医生只是一个知识库，那它就会消失。然而，问题是，我实际上认为“医生”这个词的真正含义，并不是指那些只会握着你的手说“没关系”的人。你知道，我实际上认为，十年后、二十年后，医生这个职位仍然会存在。他们不会是知识库，他们将是知识库的专家用户，但不会是因为我上了十年医学院，我刻苦记忆了东西，所以我才是医生。那一切都将消失。那部分很好，但成为医生还有很多其他部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um and so the diagnostic capabilities, these are much better knowledge stores than any human being on the planet. So you go well if a doctor is just a knowledge store yeah that's going away. However the question is actually think that really do mean doctor and it's not like oh someone who holds your hand and says oh it's okay etc. Um you know I actually think there will be a a position for a doctor 10 years from now 20 years from now. It won't be as the knowledge store. It will be as a user of the as an expert user of the knowledge store, but it's not going to be, oh, because I went to med school for 10 years and I memorized things intensely, that's why I'm a doctor. That's all going away. Great. That part, but that but there's a lot of other parts to being a doctor now.</p>
</details>

Reid: 所以，我使用了**ChatGPT** Pro，你知道，进行了深度研究。我使用了**Claude 4 Opus 4.5**，你知道，进行了深度研究。我使用了**Gemini Ultra**。我使用了**Copilot**进行了深度研究。在所有这些工具中，我尽我所能地进行提示，以获得对我立场最有利的论点，因为我想，我即将就**AI**进行辩论，我当然应该使用**AI**来辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I went to Chat GBT Pro, you know, using deep research. I went to Claude, you know, uh, 4 Opus 4.5 deep research. I went to Gemini Ultra. I went to co-pilot deep research. And I in all of these things, I was doing everything I knew about prompting for to give me the best possible arguments for my position because I thought, well, I'm about to debate on AI. Of course, I should be using AI debate.</p>
</details>

Reid: 尽管我做了最大的努力，但答案只有B-或B。我不是说世界上没有更好的提示工程师，但我从**GPT-4**公开发布前六个月就获得了访问权限，一直在做这件事。对吧？所以我在提示方面有一些经验。我不是一个业余的提示工程师。所以，我看到这个结果，然后我想，“哦，这非常有趣，它揭示了当前**大型语言模型**在推理能力上的局限性。”因为，它基本上做了10到15分钟的计算，使用了32个**GPU**计算集群进行推理，完成了所有惊人的工作。相对于分析师需要三天才能完成的工作，它在10分钟内就完成了。当然，我并行设置了所有这些，你知道，在不同的浏览器标签页中，所有这些都进入不同的系统，然后对它们进行了比较。但它的缺陷在于，它给我的是关于今天优秀杂志、优秀文章如何支持这个立场的共识意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">The answers were B minus or B despite absolute topping. And I'm not like maybe there's probably better prompters in the world, but I've been doing this since I got access to GPD4 6 months before the public did. Right? So I've I've got some experience in the whole prompting thing. It's not like I'm an amateur prompter. And so I looked at this and I went, "Oh, this is very interesting and a telling of where current LLMs are limited in their reasoning capabilities." because um what it did is it basically did you know 10 to 15 minutes of like 32 GPU compute clusters doing inference bringing off all in amazing work relative to a work that an analyst would have produced in 3 days was produced in 10 minutes and of course I set it up all in parallel you know with different browser tabs all all going into the different systems and then ran the comparisons across them everything but its flaw was is that it was giving me a consensus opinion about how articles in good magazines, good things are arguing for that position today.</p>
</details>

Reid: 所有这些都很薄弱，因为它有点像，“哦，你需要人类来交叉检查诊断，对吧？”这在其中是一个普遍的主题。我想，好吧，顺便说一句，作为技术人员，我们非常清楚，人类交叉检查诊断，我们将会有**AI**交叉检查诊断。我们将会有**AI**交叉检查**AI**交叉检查诊断。当然，这里某个地方会有一些人类，但那不会是核心。20年后，医生将交叉检查诊断，因为顺便说一句，医生应该很快学会的是，如果你相信与**AI**给出的共识意见不同的东西，你最好有一个非常好的理由，并且你需要去进行一些调查。这并不意味着**AI**总是正确的。这实际上是我们在所有职业中都需要的东西，那就是更多的**横向思维**（Lateral Thinking: 一种非传统、创造性的问题解决方式）。好吧，这是一个很好的共识意见。现在，如果它不是共识意见呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all of that was weak because it was kind of like, oh, you need to have humans cross-check the diagnosis, right? Like was a common theme across this. I'm like, well, by the way, very clearly we know as technologists that human cross-checking the diagnosis, we're going to have AI cross-checking the diagnosis. We're going to have AI cross-checking the AI are cross-checking the diagnosis. And sure, there'll be humans around here somewhere, but like that's not going to be the central place to say in 20 years doctors are going to be cross-checking the diagnosis. Cuz by the way, what doctors should be learning very quickly is if you believe something different than the consensus opinion that an AI gives you, you'd better have a very good reason and you're going to go do some investigation. Doesn't mean the AI is always right. That's actually part of what you're like what we're going to need in all of our professions is is more sideways thinking, more lateral thinking. The okay, this is good consensus opinion. Now, what if it's not consensus opinion?</p>
</details>

>> 这就是医生需要做的事情。这就是律师需要做的事情。这就是程序员需要做的事情。你知道，这就是它的本质。而**大型语言模型**在这方面仍然存在结构性限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's what doctors need to be doing. That's what lawyers will need to be doing. That's what coders will need to be doing. You know, that's what it is. And LLMs are still pretty structurally limited there.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，这很有趣。我最喜欢的一句话是**理查德·费曼**（Richard Feynman: 著名物理学家，以其对科学和教育的独特见解而闻名）说的：“科学是对专家无知的信仰。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's funny. My my favorite saying is by Richard Feman. Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.</p>
</details>

Reid: 是的。有太多的职业，其专业性体现在**资质主义**（Credentialism: 过分强调学历和证书的倾向）上，对吧？它就像“如果这样，那么那样”。就像我有医学博士学位，所以我懂。我有法学博士学位，所以我懂。这就是为什么编程实际上有点超前，因为它就像“我不在乎你从哪里获得学位”。它有点超前于社会其他部分。现在，嗯，这很有趣，**米尔顿·弗里德曼**（Milton Friedman: 著名经济学家，自由主义思想的倡导者）有一次被问到，因为他是一位著名的自由主义者，你难道不认为脑外科医生应该有资质吗？他回答说，是的，市场会解决这个问题。这听起来有点疯狂，对吧？但这就是我们现在在比特世界中进行编码的方式。嗯，但感觉很多这种不那么先进的思维方式，是因为它很大程度上建立在层层**资质主义**之上。这是一个非常好的启发式方法。从历史上看，它一直如此。如果你有一个从**哈佛医学院**（Harvard Medical School: 哈佛大学的医学院）以优异成绩毕业的医生，那他很可能是一个好医生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. And there are so many professions where the credentialism is the expertness, right? It's like it's it's if this then that. And it's like I have MD, therefore I know. I have JD, therefore I know. And that's that's why coding is actually a little bit ahead of it because it's like I don't care where you got your degree. This is a it's kind of ahead of the rest of society. Now, um it's funny, Milton Friedman one time got asked um because he was you famous libertarian, don't you think that brain surgeons should be credentials? And it's like yeah, the market will figure that out. seems kind of crazy, right? But that's how we we now do coding when you're in the world of bits. Um, but it feels like a lot of the reasons why you have this, you know, very not not very advanced thinking is because so much of it is built upon layers of credentialism. And that's that's a very good huristic. Historically, it has been. If you have a doctor that graduated at the top of their class from Harvard Medical School, it's like probably a good doctor.</p>

Reid: 专业知识。我以为你会谈到比特与原子，这现在很有趣，因为像**高盛**（Goldman Sachs: 一家全球领先的投资银行和金融服务公司）的卖方分析师这种高价值工作，那是深度研究，对吧？而叠衣服，那需要10万美元的**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure: 购买固定资产的支出）。所以它不如你每小时付10美元的人做得好。**原子世界**的东西很难被颠覆。是的。最终我们会做到，但那是**硅谷**的盲点。但这就像**资本支出**与**运营支出**（Opex: Operating Expenditure: 维持日常运营的支出），或者说是比特与原子。

I thought you were going to get into um you know, Bits versus Adam atoms where it's kind of interesting right now where it's like all this highv value work like Goldman Sachs sellside analyst, that's deep research, right? Whereas Fold by Laundry, that's $100,000 of capex. So it doesn't work as well as somebody that you could pay $10 an hour to. And it's like the atoms stuff is so hard to actually disrupt. Yes. Um and we're going to get there eventually, but that's where Silicon Valley certainly has a blind spot. But it's like a capex versus opex or like you know bits versus Adams.</p>

Reid: 是的，原子是另一部分，但这也是生物学的原因，因为生物是比特化的原子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And what's the what's the best explanation for why it's so hard to figure out fold folding laundry but so easy to figure out? Um</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，实际上并没有那么难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> well it's actually not that hard to figure out</p>
</details>

>> 或者为什么我们花了更长的时间，更昂贵，因为我们无法预见到。

<p class="english-text">>> or why it's taken us much longer much more expensive because we couldn't it would have been hard to foresee that in advance.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，我记得几年前我和**伊利亚**（Ilya Sutskever: OpenAI 联合创始人兼首席科学家，此处指他）谈过这个问题，就像为什么如果你读**艾萨克·阿西莫夫**（Isaac Asimov: 著名科幻小说作家）的小说，里面谈到人们会为你做饭、叠衣服，为什么这些事情都没有发生？嗯，那是因为你从来没有一个足够聪明的大脑。这是问题的一部分，就是你可以，我的意思是，是的，你有像“你如何拿起这个水瓶”这样的事情，结果发现你的手非常非常……为什么人类比所有其他物种更先进？有两个原因：第一，我们有对生拇指；第二，我们发明了一种语言系统，可以代代相传，那就是文字。海豚非常聪明，实际上有一个完整的理论，它不仅仅是脑容量，而是脑身比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I remember I talked to Ilia about this a few years ago and it's like why is it that if you read an Asimov no no novel where it talked about like how you know people will cook for you and fold your lawn like why have none of these things happened. Um and it's like well you just never had a brain that was smart enough. This was part of the problem is that you could I mean yes you have things like you know how do you actually pick up this water bottle and it turns out your hands are very very well like why are humans more advanced than every other species. So there are two reasons number one is we have opposable thumbs and then number two is we've come up with a language system that we could pass down from generation to generation which is writing dolphins are very smart like there was actually a whole theory which is it wasn't just brain size it was brain to body size</p>
</details>

>> 所以人类是最高的。不。不是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so humans were the highest. Nope. Not true.</p>
</details>

Reid: 现在我们实际上测量了每一种动物，有很多动物的脑身比比人类更高。嗯，比如大象或海豚的这个比例更高，我忘了具体数字，但有很多动物实际上比人类更先进，但它们没有对生拇指。正因为如此，它们从未发展出文字。所以它们无法代代相传。而人类做到了。然后当然，人类的状况就像这样，然后工业革命，然后它就这样发展，现在它继续这样发展。顺便说一句，这就是为什么在过去四五年里，我意识到的一件事是，你知道，因为人类被经典地分类为**智人**（Homo sapiens），我实际上认为我们是**霍莫·特克尼库斯**（Homo Technicus: 意指通过技术迭代不断进化的智人），因为它是通过技术进行的迭代。是的。是的。没错。无论是哪种版本，写作、打字，你知道，但我们通过技术进行迭代。这才是真正的东西，它传给后代，建立在科学之上，你知道，所有其他的一切。我认为这才是真正的关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now that we've actually measured every single animal, there are a lot of animals that have more brain over body size. Um like that that that that ratio is in tilt of an elephant or of a dolphin or I forgot the numbers, but there are a bunch that are actually more advanced than humans, but they don't have opposable thumbs. And because of that, they never developed writing. So they can't actually iterate from generation to generation. And humans did. And then of course like the human condition was like it was this and then the industrial revolution then it went like that and now it's continued like this. By the way, this is the reason why in the last four or five years, one of the things I realized is, you know, um because of the classic uh uh classification of human beings as homo sapiens. I actually think we're homo because it's that iteration through technology. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Whatever version, writing, typing, you know, but it's we iterate through technology. That's the actual thing goes to future generations, builds on science, you know, all the rest of it. And that's what I think is really key.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。其他一些解释可能是，我们在白领工作方面拥有比“拿起东西”更多的数据，或者有些人提出了这种进化论的观点，认为我们使用对生拇指的时间比我们阅读的时间要长得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. A couple other explanations could be that we have more training data on white collar work than sort of you know pick picking things up or or some people make this evolutionary argument that we've been using our disposable thumbs for way longer than we've been say you know reading</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，是的，那是蜥蜴脑，你的大部分大脑都不是新皮质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">well yeah it's the the lizard brain like most of your brain is not the neoortex</p>
</details>

Reid: 就像绘画等等，这实际上非常非常困难。你找不到一只会画画的海豚。这可能是因为它们没有对生拇指，但也可能是因为大脑的那个部分没有发展。但你有数十亿年的进化，用于这些半自主的反应，比如战或逃，这已经存在了很长时间，远在绘画之前。但我认为主要问题是，你遇到了电池化学问题。我不能……事实证明，锂离子电池非常酷，但它的能量密度相对于细胞中的**ATP**（Adenosine Triphosphate: 三磷酸腺苷，细胞内能量的直接来源）来说非常糟糕，对吧？你有所有这些机器人不起作用的原因，但首先也是最重要的是，大脑从来没有那么好。所以你有了像**费努**（Fanuc: 一家日本机器人和自动化公司）这样的机器人，它制造装配线机器人。这些机器人工作得非常好，但它们是高度确定性的。但一旦你进入多自由度，你需要让很多事情协同工作。而**资本支出**，就像我需要10万美元才能让一个机器人为我叠衣服。我们有这么多额外的人可以做这项工作。经济上从来没有意义。但这就是为什么日本是机器人领域的领导者，因为他们雇不到人。所以，我不如建造。真实的故事，我在日本打保龄球时，他们有一个机器人，一个自动售货机机器人，会给你保龄球鞋，然后它会清洁保龄球鞋，对吧？而你在这里永远不会建造那样的东西，因为你会从当地高中雇一个人来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and like that's the like draw and paint and everything else which is actually very very hard. you can't find a dolphin that can draw or paint. And that's probably because they don't have opposable thumbs, but it's also like maybe that part of the brain hasn't developed, but you have like you have billions of years of evolution for these somewhat autonomous responses like fight or flight that's been around for a long long time well before drawing and painting. But I think the main issue is just like you have battery chemistry problems. Like I can't like it turns out like a lithium ion battery is pretty cool, but the energy density of that is terrible relative to ATP with cells, right? Like you have all of these reasons why robotics don't work, but first and foremost is the brain was never very good. So you had robotics like Fenoo, which makes assembly line robots. Those work really well, but it's like very deterministic or highly deterministic. But once you go into like, you know, multiple degrees of freedom, you have to get so many things to work. And the capex, it's like I need $100,000 to have a robot fold my laundry. And we have so many extra people that will do that work. The economics never made sense. But this is why Japan is a leader in robotics. because they can't hire anybody. So therefore, I might as well build true story, I went bowling in Japan and they had a robot to give like a vending machine robot that would give you your bowling shoes and then it would clean the bowling shoes, right? And it's like you would never build that here because you'd hire some guy from the local high school and he'd go do that.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。而且便宜得多，实际上也更有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And much cheaper and actually more effective.</p>
</details>

Reid: 但这就是**资本支出**，当**资本支出**线和**运营支出**线交叉时，就会觉得“哦，我应该建造机器人了”。所以这是你可能需要的另一件事。但如果成本下降，那么当然它就会倾向于**资本支出**而不是**运营支出**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But it's this capex like the capex line and the opex line when they cross then it's like oo I should build robots. So that's the other thing that you probably need. But if the cost goes down then of course it it goes in in favor of capex versus opex.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为在机器人方面还有其他几点需要深入探讨。所以，一个是密度，比特与价值的密度。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think there's other couple things to go in deeper on the robot side. So one is the density the the the the bits to value. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Reid: 对。所以，就像在语言中，当我们把所有这些东西封装起来，甚至封装到浪漫小说中时，它有很高的比特与价值比，而当你置身于整个世界中时，有很多东西，比如你如何从所有这些比特中抽象出来，以及你如何抽象它们？还有一部分是常识意识，就像我看到**GPT-2**、**3**、**4**、**5**时，它是一个**智者症候群**（Savant Syndrome: 在某些特定领域表现出超常能力，但在其他方面可能存在障碍的现象）的进展，对吧？这些智者症候群令人惊叹，但这并不意味着它就是智者。但当它犯错时，就像一个经典例子，**微软**已经运行了多年的代理相互长时间对话，就像“让我们运行一年，看看会发生什么”，它们经常陷入“谢谢你，不，谢谢你。不，谢谢你。”一个月后，又是“谢谢你，不，谢谢你。”而人类会说：“停下来，对吧？”就像它是一个简单的表达**情境感知**（Context Awareness: 理解和利用环境信息的能力）的方式，说不，不，不，不。让我们保持高度**情境感知**。即使进展如此神奇，比如更好的数据、更好的推理、更好的个性化等等，**情境感知**也只是一个代理。是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. So like in language when we encapsulated all these things even into like romance novels there's a high bits to value whereas when you're kind of in the whole world there's a lot of like how do you we abstract from all those bits and how do you abstract them? There's another part of it which is kind of common sense awareness like this is one of the things that like when I look at you know GBD2 3 4 5 it's a progression of sants right and the soants are amazing it doesn't mean the savant but but like when it makes mistakes like as a classic thing so Microsoft has had running for years now agents talking to each other long form like just like let's go for a year and do that and see what happens and so often they get into like oh thank you no thank you. No, thank you. One month later, thank you. No, thank you. Which human beings are like, stop, right? Like just like it's and that's like a that's a simple way of putting the context awareness thing of saying no, no, no, no. Let's let's stay very context aware. And even as magical as the progression has been, like much much better data, much much better reasoning, much much better uh personalization, etc., etc., context awareness only is a proxy of that. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 我想深入探讨你关于医生的问题，Reid，因为Alex，我们刚刚发布了你关于软件吞噬劳动力的演讲。我很好奇你有什么框架来思考哪些领域会有更多的**Copilot**模型，而哪些领域会完全取代工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I want to go deeper on um your question about doctor's read and because Alex, we just released one of your talks around you software eating labor and I'm curious where you how you what sort of frameworks you have for thinking about what spaces are going to have more of this co-pilot model versus what spaces it's going to be sort of replacing the work entirely.</p>
</details>

Reid: 我希望我能做到，我将使用**大型语言模型**来预测未来，但我会得到一个B-。所以也许我会回答我得到一个B+。嗯，我认为很多情况都像自然一样，存在这种拟态版本，那就是，好吧，我信任医生。每个人都信任医生。启发式方法是：你在哪里上的医学院？显然，现在有三分之二的医生使用**Open Evidence**（Open Evidence: 一种类似 ChatGPT 但专门针对医学文献的 AI 工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I have I wish I could I'm going to use an LM to go predict the future, but I'm going to get a B minus. So maybe I'll answer I get a B+. Um I think a lot of it is like the natural like there there's this skumorphic version which is okay. Well, I I trust the doctor. Everybody trusts the doctor. The heristic is where did you go to medical school? Apparently, twothirds of doctors now use open evidence.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，它就像**ChatGPT**，但它吸收了《**新英格兰医学杂志**》（The New England Journal of Medicine: 一份著名的医学期刊），并获得了许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, which is like chat GPT, but it ingested the New England Journal of Medicine have like a license to that.</p>

Reid: 所以，嗯。

>> 是的，**丹尼尔·纳德勒**（Daniel Nadler: Kensho 创始人，Open Evidence 的开发者）。

<p class="english-text">>> yeah, Daniel Nadler, good.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，**肯**（Ken: 指 Kensho，一家金融 AI 公司）？所以，是的。所以，这似乎没有理由不这样做。就像我的**七宗罪**版本，我会简化它，那就是每个人都想更懒惰、更富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Ken, right? So, yeah. So, so that seems like there's no reason not to do that. Like my my seven deadly sins version, uh, I'll simplify it, which is like everybody wants to be lazier and richer. M</p>
</details>

>> 所以，如果这是一种让我能接触更多病人，同时减少工作量的方式，人们当然会使用它，没有理由不这样做。但它是否取代了特定的工作？实际上，大多数像“软件吞噬劳动力”的事情，它现在并没有真正吞噬劳动力。效果最好的不是“嘿，我有一个产品，每个人都会失业”，没有人会购买这样的产品，它很难分发。相反，是“我将给你这个神奇的产品，让你变得更懒惰”。显然，它不会被这样表述，因为“懒惰和富有”听起来有点，你知道，不太好，但它会让你工作更少时间，赚更多钱。这是一个非常杀手级的组合。如果你有这样的产品，而且它是由已经拥有专业知识启发式的人提供的，这些产品就会一个接一个地被采纳、采纳、采纳。然后最终你会遇到你提到的那种情况，如果你在得到医疗诊断时没有使用**ChatGPT**，那你就是疯了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so if this is a way that I can like get more patients and do less work of course people are going to use this there's no reason not to but does it replace that particular thing and actually most of like the the software eats labor thing it doesn't actually eat labor right now the thing that's working the best is not like hey I have a product where everybody's going to lose their job nobody's going to buy that product it's very very hard to get that distributed as opposed to I will give you this magic product that allows you to be lazier obviously it's not framed this way like lazy and rich sounds kind of uh you know not not great but I'm going to let you work fewer hours and make more money. And that's that's a very killer combo. And if you have a product like that, um, and it's delivered by somebody that already has that heruristic of expertise, these are just going to go one after another and get adopted, adopted, adopted. And then eventually you're going to have cases like the one that you mentioned where if you don't use chat GPT when you get a medical diagnosis, you're insane.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, that's why I'm convinced that AI is massively underhyped because in in Silicon Valley, you might not make that claim. Maybe it's overhyped. Maybe valuation, whatever.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We all we all don't think it's overhyped.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，但我认为一旦我在现实世界中遇到某人，并向他们展示这些东西，他们就一无所知。部分原因就像他们看到了**IBM Watson**（IBM Watson: IBM 开发的问答系统，曾因在智力竞赛节目中获胜而闻名）的广告，然后说：“哦，那就是**AI**。”不，那不是**AI**，对吧？或者他们看到了假的**AI**。他们两年前看到了**ChatGPT**，它没有解决问题。嗯，这很有趣。我写了一篇博客文章。你知道，当你是我在**TrialPay**（TrialPay: 一家在线广告和支付公司，后被 Visa 收购）的投资者时，我把它叫做《**永远不要以现在来评判人**》（Never Judge People on the Present: Reid Hoffman 的一篇博客文章）。这是一个错误。这是一个类别错误，很多大公司的人都会犯，但我的意思是这几乎是隐喻性的。我写这篇博客文章的方式是，我找到了一段**老虎伍兹**（Tiger Woods: 著名高尔夫球手）两岁半时的视频。他打出了一个完美直线球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but I think once I meet somebody in the real world and I show them this stuff, they have no idea. And part of it is like they see the IBM Watson commercials and like, "Oh, that's AI." No, that's not AI, right? Or they see the fake AI. They've seen chat GPT two years ago. It didn't solve a problem. And uh it's funny. I I made this blog post. You know, back back when when you were my investor at Trial Pay, I called it never judge people on the present. And this is a mistake. It's it's a category error that a lot of big company people make, but I mean that almost metaphorically. And the way that I wrote this blog post was I found a video of Tiger Woods. He was two and a half years old. He hit a perfectly straight drive</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，他当时在，你知道，不是**今夜秀**（The Tonight Show: 美国一档著名的深夜脱口秀节目）之类的节目上。有两种方式观看那个视频。你可以说：“好吧，我44岁了，我可以比那个孩子打得远得多，”这是正确的。或者你可以说：“哇，如果那个两岁半的孩子继续这样下去，他可能会非常非常出色。”

Reid: 大多数人都是以现在来评判事物。是的。这就是为什么它被低估了，因为它就像他们在某个时间点尝试过。

Reid: 嗯，他们尝试的时间有一个分布，从概率上讲是在过去，然后他们会说：“哦，那对我的用例不起作用。它不起作用。”那很糟糕。但我认为它将主要围绕“懒惰致富”这个概念传播。这就是很多这些东西得以发展的原因。我在那些非常大的公司中看到的较少，因为在非常大的公司中存在**主代理问题**（Principal-Agent Problem: 委托人与代理人之间利益不一致导致的问题）。就像，好吧，我的公司赚钱了或省钱了。我是XYZ的董事。我只知道我想早点下班并获得晋升。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there's a distribution of when they tried it, like probabilistically it's in the past and like, "Oh, that didn't work for my use case. It doesn't work." And that's that's that's bad. But so I think it's going to diffuse largely around this like lazy rich like concept. And that's where a lot of these things have taken off. And I see it less at the very very big companies because you have a principal agent problem at the very big companies. Like okay my company made money or save money. I'm a director of XYZ. Like all I know is that I want to leave earlier and get promoted. Yeah.</p>

>> 这实际上对我有什么帮助？它帮助了公司的虚无实体。然而，在小型企业或个体经营者，或个体医生那里，我经营一家皮肤科诊所，不知何故我可以拥有五倍的病人，或者我是一名原告律师，我可以获得五倍的和解金。这就像，我当然会使用它，因为我可以更懒惰、更富有。

Reid: 很多怀疑论者正是如此。他们会说：“嗯，我两个月前试过，它没有解决这个问题。所以它很糟糕。”那是因为你以现在来评判它。你需要进行推断。嗯，你不想在“哦，**大型语言模型**有这个”之类的方面过度推断。你实际上会觉得，低估**AI**的人有两种：一种是一无所知的人，另一种是无所不知的人。

Reid: 并不是说它能做所有事情。例如，我仍然认为，如果我输入“**Reid Hoffman**应该如何通过投资**AI**赚钱”，我将再次尝试，或者我怀疑我仍然会得到我认为是“笨蛋商学院教授”的答案，而不是实际的游戏规则。但是，每个人都应该尝试。你知道，例如，当我们收到演示文稿时，我们会把它放进去，然后说：“给我一个尽职调查计划。”对。如果这里不是每个人都在这样做，那是一个错误。

### AI的未来：模型融合与可预测性

>> 是的。嗯，就推断而言。显然，过去几年取得了令人难以置信的增长。你当然从一开始就参与了**OpenAI**。当我们展望未来几年时，一个更广泛的问题是，扩展定律是否会成立，或者我们能用**大型语言模型**走到多远。嗯，我们是否需要另一种突破？你对这些问题有什么看法？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um in terms of let's go back to extrapolation. Obviously the last few years have had incredible um growth. You you were involved of course with open eyes since the beginning. When we look for the next few years um is a broader question as to whether scaling laws will hold whether sort of the limitations um or how far we can get with with LLMs. um do we need another breakthrough of a different kind? What is your view on some of these questions?</p>
</details>

Reid: 所以，我们都在这个推断未来的宇宙中遨游。**硅谷**的一个伟大之处在于，你会听到像**奇点理论**（Singularity Theory: 预测人工智能将超越人类智能，导致社会发生不可预测变化的理论）、**超智能**（Superintelligence: 远超人类智能的人工智能）理论、很快达到**超智能**的指数增长理论。我发现，通常的错误不是推断未来这个事实，那很聪明，人们需要这样做，而且做的人太少了。我想我记得我喜欢你的帖子并帮助推广了它，如果我没记错的话。

Reid: 嗯，但问题是，那是什么曲线？如果它是一个**智者症候群**曲线，那与“天哪，它是一个神化，现在它是上帝”是不同的，你知道吗？它就像，不，不，不，它会是一个比我们现在拥有的更惊人的**智者症候群**。但顺便说一句，如果它只是**智者症候群**，那我们总有空间。总有空间留给通才、交叉检查者和**情境感知**等等。现在，也许它会跨越一个阈值，也许不会。你知道，我认为那里有很多不同的问题，但那种推断往往会变成“好吧，它是指数级的，所以两年半后就会有魔法”，然后你会说，“好吧，看，它确实是魔法，但并非所有魔法都是如此。”这就是做事的方式。所以，我个人的信念是，嗯，看，**大型语言模型**的批评者犯了一个错误，你知道，我们可以逐一列举所有不同的批评者，哦，它不是知识表示，它在素数上搞砸了，你知道，等等等等。我们都……

Reid: 是的。没错。没错。你知道，就像，“哇，看，它坏了。”然后你会说，“你错过了魔法，对吧？”是的，也许有些结构性问题，即使在3到5年内，对**大型语言模型**来说仍然是一个难题。但**AI**不仅仅是“一个**大型语言模型**统治一切”。它是模型的组合。我们已经有了模型的组合。我们使用**扩散模型**（Diffusion Models: 一种生成模型，用于图像和视频生成）来完成各种图像和视频任务。顺便说一句，如果没有**大型语言模型**，它们将无法工作，因为需要**本体论**（Ontology: 哲学中研究存在本质的学问，在 AI 中指知识表示的结构）来生成“给我一个**星际迷航**（Star Trek: 著名科幻系列）船长**埃里克·托尔伯格**（Eric Torberg: 虚构人物），去探索宇宙，与**瓦肯人**（Vulcans: 星际迷航中的外星种族）进行第一次接触”之类的东西。现在，用我们的手机就可以做到，对吧？它会出现在那里，感谢**OpenAI**和**Google**的**Gemini**，因为**Google**的模型也非常好，但它需要**大型语言模型**来实现。但人们没有注意到的是，它将是**大型语言模型**和融合模型，我认为还有其他东西，它们之间有一个连接的“织物”。现在一个有趣的问题是，这个“织物”是基础的**大型语言模型**吗？还是其他东西？我认为这还有待确定，以及它达到智能的程度是一个有趣的问题。

Like, yes, maybe there's some structural things that over time, even in 3 to 5 years, will continue to be a difficult problem for LLMs. But AI is not just the one LLM to rule them all. It's a combination of models. We already have combination of models. We use diffusion models for various image and video tasks. Now, by the way, they wouldn't work al without also having the LLMs in order to have the ontology to say create me an Eric Torberg as a Star Trek captain, you know, going out to, you know, explore the universe and meeting first contact with the Vulcans and so forth, which, you know, now with our phone, we could do that, right? and it will be there uh courtesy open AI uh and you know VO because Google's model is also very good but it needs LM for that but the thing that people don't track is it's going to be LLMs and a fusion models and I think other things with a with a fabric across them now one of the interesting questions is is the fabric fundamental LLMs is the fabric other things I think that's a TBD on this and the degree to which it gets to intelligence is an interesting question now one of the things I think is a Um, you know, like I I talked to all the critics intensely, not because I necessarily agree with the criticism, but I'm trying to get to the what's the kernel of insight.</p>

Reid: 就像我喜欢**斯图尔特·罗素**（Stuart Russell: 著名人工智能研究者，著有《人工智能：一种现代方法》）最近一系列对话中的一点，他说：“嘿，如果我们能让这些模型的‘织物’更具可预测性，那将大大缓解对‘如果出现问题会怎样’的担忧。”好吧，让我们尝试这样做。现在，我不认为输出的整个验证，就像逻辑上的，我们甚至无法验证代码，对吧？验证对我来说非常困难。现在，他是一个聪明人。也许我们会弄清楚。但另一方面，这是一个好目标。我们能否使其更具可编程性、更可靠？我认为这是一个好目标，非常聪明的人应该为此努力。顺便说一句，聪明的**AI**也是如此。这就像数学方面的一些问题，如果你思考世界的基础。我的意思是，哲学是万物的基础。实际上，数学源于哲学。它被称为**笛卡尔平面**（Cartesian Plane: 笛卡尔坐标系，由法国哲学家笛卡尔创立），以**笛卡尔**（René Descartes: 法国哲学家、数学家、科学家）命名。你知道，你学哲学。你知道这个，对吧？所以，你有哲学、数学、物理学。为什么**牛顿**（Isaac Newton: 英国物理学家、数学家、天文学家）建立微积分来理解真实世界？所以，数学、物理学，物理学带来化学，化学带来生物学，然后生物学带来心理学。这就是这个堆栈。所以如果你解决了数学，那实际上非常有趣，因为**罗格斯大学**（Rutgers University: 美国一所著名的公立研究型大学）的**孔托维奇**教授（Contovich: 指 Rutgers 大学教授，此处未给出全名）对此写了很多。我发现这部分非常引人入胜，作为一个前数学家，因为有一些非常非常困难的问题。

<p class="english-text">And like one of the things that I um loved about, you know, kind of a set of recent conversations with Stuart Russell was say, hey, if we could actually get the fabric of these models to be more predictable, that would greatly uh allay the fears of what happens if something goes a muck. Well, okay, let's try to do that. Now, I don't think the whole verification of outputs like like logical like we can't even do verification of coding, right? Like verification strikes me as very hard. Now, brilliant man. Maybe we'll figure it out. But the um but but on the other hand, the hey, this is a good goal. Can we make that more programmable, reliable? I think that is a good goal that people that very smart people should be working on. And by the way, smart AIs. Well, that's some of the math side is like if you think about the the foundation of the world. I mean, uh, philosophy is the basis of everything. Actually, math cames from philosophy. It's called the cartisian plane after Decart. You know, you're a philosophy. You know this, right? So, you have you have uh philosophy, math, physics, like why did Newton build calculus to understand the real world? So, math, physics, physics gets you chemistry, chemistry gets you biology, and then biology gets you psychology. So, that's kind of the stack. So if you solve math, that's actually quite interesting because um there's a professor at Rutgers Contovich who's written about this a lot. Um and I find this part fascinating just as a former mathematician because there are some very very hard problems.</p>

Reid: 有传言说**DeepMind**将解决**纳维-斯托克斯方程**（Navier-Stokes Equation: 描述流体运动的偏微分方程，是“千禧年大奖难题”之一），那将是巨大的突破。那是**克莱数学研究所**（Clay Mathematics Institute: 一个致力于增进和传播数学知识的非营利机构）的千禧年大奖难题之一。

### 意识、自由意志与AI的哲学边界

>> 所以，正如你刚才提到的，Alex Reed，你主修哲学，但你对深度神经科学也非常感兴趣。有些人说，嘿，我们永远无法创造出拥有自己意识的**AI**，因为我们不了解我们自己的意识。我们不了解我们自己的大脑是如何运作的。嗯，然后还有一个更广泛的问题，哦，**AI**会有自己的目标吗？或者会有自己的能动性吗？你对这些围绕意识与**AI**相关的问题有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as you just mentioned, Alex Reed, you're a philosophy major, but you're also very interested in deep in neuroscience. And some people say that, hey, we'll never create AI with its own consciousness because we don't understand our own consciousness. We don't understand how our own brain works. Um, and and then there's broader question as, oh, will AI have its own goals or will have its own agency? Uh, what what is sort of your view on on some of these questions surrounding consciousness relates to AI?</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，意识本身就是一个火球，我会对此说几点。我认为能动性和目标几乎是确定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, consciousness is its own fireball, which I will say a few things about. I think agency and goals is almost certain.</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，我认为这是一个我们需要明确和控制的领域之一，这有点像“什么样的计算结构将它整合在一起”的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there is a question I think this is one of the areas where we want to ex um have some clarity and control that was a little bit like the the kind of question what kind of compute fabric holds it together</p>
</details>

Reid: 因为如果没有它能够设定自己的最小子目标和其他各种东西，你就无法进行复杂的解决问题。所以，目标设定和行为以及从中进行的推断，这就是你得到经典的那种情况，比如你告诉它最大化，你告诉它最大化回形针，它就会试图将整个星球变成回形针。有一点绝对是老式计算机的特点，那就是没有**情境感知**，这也是我甚至担心现代**AI**系统的问题。但另一方面，它就像，看，如果你真的在创造智能，它们不会说“哦，让我来，让我试着把所有东西都变成回形针”，它实际上并没有那么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> because you can't get complex problem solving without it being able to set its own minimum sub goals and other kinds of things and so so goal setting and behavior and inference from it and that's where you get the classic kind of like well you tell it to maximize you tell it to maximize paper clips and it tries to convert the entire planet into paper clips and there's one thing that's definitely old computer that which is no context awareness something I even worry about modern AI systems but on the other hand it's like look if you're actually creating intelligence they don't go oh let me let like let me just go try to convert everything into paper clips it's like it's it's actually in fact not that simple in terms of how it plays now um now consciousness is an interesting question because you got some very smart people Roger Penrose um who I actually interviewed way back and on Emperor's New Mind, speaking of mathematicians um and um you know who are like look actually in fact there's some thing about our form of intelligence our form of of of computational intelligence that's quantum based that has to do with how our physics work that has to do with things like t tubulars and so forth and by the way it's not impossible like that's that's that's a it's a coherent theory from a very smart mathematician like one of the world's smartest right? Like it's kind of in the category of there's other people as smart, but there's no one smarter, right, in in in that convective. And so so that's possible. Um I don't think you need consciousness for um goal setting uh or reasoning. Um I'm not even sure you need consciousness for certain forms of self-awareness. There may be some forms of self-awareness that consciousness is necessary for. It's a tricky thing. philosophers have been trying to address this not very well for as long as we've got records of philosophy, right? And and philosophers agree. I'm not philosophers wouldn't think I was throwing him under the bus with this. They're like, "Yeah, this is a hard problem because it ties to agency and free will and a bunch of other things." And and I think that the right thing to do is keep an open mind.</p>
</details>

Reid: 现在，意识是一个有趣的问题，因为有一些非常聪明的人，比如**罗杰·彭罗斯**（Roger Penrose: 著名数学物理学家，对意识和量子力学有独特见解），我很久以前采访过他，他在《**皇帝的新脑**》（The Emperor's New Mind: 罗杰·彭罗斯的著作，探讨意识与量子力学）中谈到了数学家，他们认为我们的智能形式、我们的计算智能形式是基于量子的，与我们的物理学如何运作有关，与像微管之类的东西有关。顺便说一句，这并非不可能，这是一个非常聪明的数学家提出的一个连贯理论，他是世界上最聪明的人之一，对吧？它属于那种“有其他人一样聪明，但没有人比他更聪明”的范畴。所以这是可能的。嗯，我认为目标设定或推理不需要意识。我甚至不确定某些形式的自我意识是否需要意识。可能有些形式的自我意识需要意识。这是一个棘手的问题。哲学家们一直在努力解决这个问题，但效果不佳，只要有哲学记录以来就是如此，对吧？哲学家们也同意。我不是说哲学家们会认为我是在贬低他们。他们会说：“是的，这是一个难题，因为它与能动性、自由意志和许多其他事情有关。”我认为正确的做法是保持开放的心态。

And like for example, you know, the kind of thing that you know what what I actually think most people obsess about the wrong things when it comes to AI. They obsess about the climate change stuff because actually in fact if you apply intelligence at the scale and availability of electricity, you're going to help climate change. You're going to solve grids and appliances and a bunch of other stuff. It's just like no, this will be net super positive. And by the way, you already see elements of it. U Google applied its algorithms to its own data centers which are u some of the best tuned grid systems in the world. 40% energy savings. I mean just you just d and just applying it. So that's the mistake. But one of the areas I think is this question around like what is the way that we want children growing up with AIS? What is their epistemology? What is their learning curves? You know what are the things that kind of play to this? because that kind of question is something that we want to be very intentional about in terms of how we're doing it.

They do things that are kind of like out of character but it's actually not out of character if you think about this free will override of just like chemicals going through your bloodstream which is kind of crazy to think about. Look, since we're on a geeky nerdy podcast, I'm going to say two geeky nerdy things are. One, the classic one is people say, "Yes, we are biochemical machines, but let's not be overly simplistic on what a biochemical machine is." That's like the Penrose, quantum computing, etc. And you get to this weird stuff in quantum, which is well, it's it it's of probabilistic dual superpositional form until it's measured. Why is there magic in measurement? And is that magic and measurement something that's conscious? You know, blah blah blah. know there's a bunch of stuff there. The the other um thing that I think is interesting that we're seeing as a resurgence in philosophy a little bit is idealism. Like we would have thought as physical materialists that that we go no idealists were disproven. They're gone. But actually beginning to say no actually in fact what exists is thinking and that all of the physical things around us come from that thinking. And obviously we see versions of this because you know I find myself entertained frequently here in Silicon Valley by people saying we're living in a simulation. I know it. You know it. And you're like well your simulation theory is very much like Christian intelligent design theory. It's the I have things that I can't explain. So therefore creator no therefore simulation. No therefore creator of simulation. You're like no no no but I you know. So clearly I'm not an idealist but that's why I see some resurgence of idealism happening.</p>

Reid: 我不知道。所以这是真的。我的意思是，就像饥饿一样。是的。我很饿。那是一种状态。是的。你知道，如果你正在开发**超智能**，你真的想要这种有点愚蠢的覆盖吗？我的意思是，有时一些完全正常的人会入狱，原因就是他们非常愤怒。他们做了一些有点不符合性格的事情，但如果你考虑到这种自由意志被仅仅是流经你血液的化学物质所覆盖，那实际上并不算不符合性格，这有点疯狂。听着，既然我们是在一个极客播客上，我要说两件极客的事情。第一，经典的说法是，人们说：“是的，我们是**生物化学机器**，但我们不要过于简化**生物化学机器**是什么。”这就像**彭罗斯**、**量子计算**等等。你在量子领域会遇到一些奇怪的事情，那就是，嗯，它在被测量之前是概率性的双**量子叠加**（Quantum Superposition: 量子力学中粒子可以同时处于多种状态的现象）形式。为什么测量中存在魔法？那种测量中的魔法是有意识的吗？你知道，等等等等。那里有很多东西。另一个我认为有趣的事情是，我们看到哲学中**唯心主义**（Idealism: 哲学流派，认为意识或精神是世界的基础）的复兴。我们作为物理唯物主义者，可能会认为不，**唯心主义者**已经被驳倒了。他们消失了。但实际上开始有人说不，实际上存在的是思想，我们周围所有的物理事物都来自那种思想。显然我们看到了这种版本的出现，因为你知道，我经常在**硅谷**被那些说“我们生活在一个模拟中”的人逗乐。我知道。你也知道。然后你会说，你的**模拟理论**（Simulation Theory: 认为我们所处的世界可能是一个计算机模拟的理论）非常像基督教的**智能设计理论**（Intelligent Design Theory: 认为宇宙和生命是由某种智能设计者创造的理论）。它就像，我有一些无法解释的事情。所以，因此是创造者，不，因此是模拟。不，因此是模拟的创造者。你会说不，不，不，但我，你知道。所以我显然不是一个**唯心主义者**，但这就是为什么我看到**唯心主义**正在复兴。

<p class="english-text">>> Um I want to return to uh LinkedIn how we began the conversation because we were lucky to or I was lucky to work many years with you. We would get pitches uh every week about a LinkedIn disruptor last 20 years. Right. Yes. And so and nothing's come even close.</p>
</details>

### LinkedIn的韧性与AI时代的商业模式

>> 嗯，我想回到我们开始对话的**LinkedIn**，因为我们很幸运，或者说我很幸运能和你一起工作多年。我们每周都会收到关于**LinkedIn**颠覆者的推介，过去20年都是如此。对。是的。但没有任何东西能接近它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No.</p>
</details>

Reid: 不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so it's fascinating. I'm curious why people p sort of underrated how hard it was and people have this about Twitter too or other things that kind of look simple perhaps but are actually very very difficult to unseat and have a lot of staying power. And and it's interesting you know Open AI they said they're coming out with a job service to quote use AI to help find the perfect matches between what companies need and what workers can offer. I'm curious how you think about sort of LinkedIn's durability. So look, I obviously think LinkedIn is durable, but first and foremost, I I kind of look at this as humanity, society, industry. So first and foremost is what are the things that are good for humanity, then what's good for society, then what's good for industry. And by the way, we do industry to be good for society, humanity. It's not an it's not oppositional. It's just a you know, how you're making these decisions and what you're thinking about. So I would be delighted if there were new amazing things that helped people um you know kind of uh make productive work, find productive work in make them do them. We're having going to have all this job transition uh coming from technological disruption with AI like it would be awesome. I of course would be extra awesome if it was LinkedIn bringing it just given my own personal craft of my hands and pride at what we built and all the rest. Now the thing with LinkedIn and you know Alex was with me on a lot of this journey uh you know as I sought his advice on various things um the the LinkedIn was one of those things where it's where the turtle eventually actually in fact like grows into something huge because for many many years the general scuttlebutt in Silicon Valley was LinkedIn was the was the the dull boring useless thing etc. And it was going to be Frenster. Probably most people listening to this don't know what Fster is. Then MySpace. Maybe a few people have heard of that, right? You know, and then of course we got, you know, Facebook and Meta and, you know, Tik Tok and all the rest. And part of the thing for LinkedIn is it's built a network that's hard to build, right? Because it doesn't have the same sizzle and pizzazz that photo sharing has. It doesn't have the same sizzle and pizzazz that you know you were referencing the seven deadly sins comment and back when I started doing that 2002 yes I left my walker at the door um uh the the thing that I used to say was uh Twitter was identity I actually mistook it it's wrath right and so it doesn't have the wrath you know kind of component of it and so um and so the uh you know the that and you said with LinkedIn LinkedIn's greed great you know because seven deadly sins kind of u you know because because that's you know a motivation that's very common across a lot of human beings</p>
</details>

Reid: 所以这很吸引人。我很好奇为什么人们低估了它的难度，人们对**Twitter**或其他看起来简单但实际上很难被取代且具有强大持久力的事物也有同样的看法。这很有趣，你知道，**OpenAI**表示他们将推出一项招聘服务，引用**AI**来帮助公司找到所需人才与工人所能提供的完美匹配。我很好奇你如何看待**LinkedIn**的持久性。所以，你看，我显然认为**LinkedIn**是持久的，但首先，我将此视为人类、社会、产业。所以首先是哪些对人类有益，然后是对社会有益，然后是对产业有益。顺便说一句，我们发展产业是为了对社会、人类有益。这不是对立的。这只是，你知道，你如何做出这些决定以及你正在思考什么。所以如果有什么新的、惊人的事物能帮助人们，你知道，创造生产性工作，找到生产性工作，并让他们去完成，我会很高兴。我们将面临所有这些由**AI**带来的技术颠覆所导致的就业转型，那将是太棒了。当然，如果是由**LinkedIn**来带来，那将是额外的棒，考虑到我个人的技艺以及我们所建立的一切的自豪感。现在，关于**LinkedIn**的事情，你知道Alex在我这段旅程的很多时候都和我在一起，你知道，我向他寻求各种建议。**LinkedIn**是那种乌龟最终会变得巨大的东西，因为很多很多年来，**硅谷**普遍的传言是**LinkedIn**是一个沉闷、无聊、无用的东西等等。它本会成为**弗兰斯特**（Friendster: 早期社交网络服务）。可能大多数听众不知道**弗兰斯特**是什么。然后是**MySpace**。也许有些人听说过，对吧？你知道，然后当然我们有了**Facebook**和**Meta**，你知道，**TikTok**等等。**LinkedIn**的一部分是它建立了一个难以建立的网络，对吧？因为它没有照片分享那样的轰动和魅力。它没有那种轰动和魅力，你知道，你提到了**七宗罪**的评论，当我2002年开始做这件事的时候，是的，我把我的助行器留在了门口。我过去常说的是**Twitter**是身份，我实际上误解了，它是愤怒，对吧？所以它没有愤怒的成分。所以，你知道，你和**LinkedIn**说，**LinkedIn**是贪婪，太棒了，你知道，因为**七宗罪**，你知道，因为那是一种在很多人类中非常普遍的动机。

<p class="english-text">>> yes exactly and so or you know you you're putting it in the punchy way but simply being productive yeah more value creation and acrewing some of that value to yourself</p>
</details>

Reid: 是的，没错，所以，或者你知道，你用一种有冲击力的方式表达，但简单来说就是提高生产力，创造更多价值，并将其中一部分价值归于自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and so um and so I think the reason why it's been difficult to create a uh a disruptor to LinkedIn is it's a very hard network to build. It's actually not easy. And um and by staying really true to it, you end up getting a lot of people going, well, this is this is where I am for that. And now I have a network of people with this and we are here together collaborating and doing stuff together. And that's the thing that a new thing would have to be. Um, and you know I uh you know I uh when I saw GBD4 um and uh knew that uh Microsoft had access to this. I called the LinkedIn people and said you guys have got to get in the room to see this, right? because you need to start thinking about what are the ways we help people more with that because you start with this is actually one of the things that I think people don't realize about Silicon Valley because you know the general discussion is oh you're trying to make all this money through equity and all this revenue of course you know business people are trying to do that but they don't realize is you start with what's the amazing thing that you can suddenly create and part of it is like lots of these companies like get started with and you go what's your business model you go I don't know like yeah we're going to try to work it out but I can create something amazing here and that's actually one of the fundamental like places of what they you know call it the religion of Silicon Valley and the knowledge of Silicon Valley that I so much you know love and admire and embody.</p>
</details>

Reid: 所以，嗯，我认为很难创造出**LinkedIn**的颠覆者，原因在于它是一个非常难以建立的网络。它实际上并不容易。嗯，通过真正忠于它，你最终会吸引很多人说：“好吧，这就是我为此而来的地方。”现在我拥有了一个由这些人组成的网络，我们在这里一起协作，一起做事。这就是新事物必须具备的特点。嗯，你知道，当我看到**GPT-4**时，我知道**微软**可以访问它。我打电话给**LinkedIn**的人，说：“你们必须到房间里看看这个，对吧？”因为你需要开始思考我们如何用它更好地帮助人们，因为你首先要思考的是，这实际上是人们对**硅谷**不了解的一点，因为你知道，一般的讨论是“哦，你试图通过股权和所有这些收入赚大钱”，当然，商界人士都在努力这样做，但他们没有意识到的是，你首先要思考的是你能突然创造出什么惊人的东西，其中一部分是，很多公司就是这样开始的，你问他们“你的商业模式是什么？”，他们会说“我不知道”，就像“是的，我们会努力解决，但我能在这里创造出一些惊人的东西”，这实际上是他们所说的**硅谷**的“宗教”和**硅谷**的知识体系的核心，我非常热爱、钦佩并身体力行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's that's actually a question that I have. So I'll say one thing. It's a huge compliment to LinkedIn. It's anti-fragile.</p>
</details>

>> 这实际上是我有一个问题。所以我要说一件事。这是对**LinkedIn**的巨大赞扬。它是**反脆弱**（Anti-fragile: 纳西姆·塔勒布提出的概念，指事物在面对冲击时不仅能恢复，还能变得更强）的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

Reid: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And that like Facebook, oh nobody goes there anymore. It's like the yogi bear and it's too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore. It's oh there were too many parents there and there's always been a new one. Like where did Snap like how did Snap start? like all these other networks started because people didn't want to hang out with their boomer parents. Um my my kid won't let me follow him on Instagram, right? It's like he doesn't want to use Facebook. So LinkedIn has has survived through all of that. But you referenced something that I think is a very interesting uh point which is back in like web two it was like get lots of traffic, get amazing retention, you know, smile curve and then you will figure out monetization. Yes.</p>
</details>

>> 就像**Facebook**，哦，现在没人去了。就像**瑜伽熊**（Yogi Bear: 动画片角色），太挤了。现在没人去了。哦，那里有太多父母，而且总有新的出现。就像**Snap**（Snap: Snapchat 的母公司）是怎么开始的？所有这些其他网络都是因为人们不想和他们的婴儿潮一代父母一起玩。嗯，我的孩子不让我在**Instagram**上关注他，对吧？他不想用**Facebook**。所以**LinkedIn**经受住了所有这些考验。但你提到了一个我认为非常有趣的观点，那就是在**Web 2**时代，它就像是获得大量流量，获得惊人的留存，你知道，微笑曲线，然后你就会想出如何变现。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And like that isn't happening right now. It's not like get lot Yes. It happened with chat GBT was like it's $20 a month. Yes. Right. like the monetization was kind of built in very very clear subscription versus like become giant. Yes.</p>
</details>

Reid: 而现在这种情况并没有发生。它不像“获得大量……”是的。**ChatGPT**就是这样，它每月20美元。是的。对。变现方式有点内置，非常明确的订阅模式，而不是像“变得巨大”。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Build a giant like do you think there will be new ones of those with AI?</p>
</details>

>> 建立一个巨头，你认为**AI**会带来新的巨头吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. And there will be new kind of premium. It's it's part of our tool chest. Now part of the reason why it's more tricky especially when you're doing open AI is because the the um like the cogs are changed a little. Yes. Right. For now. Yes. No. No. Like and so you just can't. This is one of the reasons why at PayPal we had to change to like we as you know because you were close to us there like we had to change to a paid model because we're like oh look we have exponentiating volume which means exponentiating cost curve which means despite having raised hundreds of millions of dollars we could literally count the we could point to the hour that we'd go out of business right because you know no you can't have an exponentiating cost curve. So I think that's one of the reasons why some of it has been different in AI because you like you can't have an exponentiating cost curve without at least a following revenue curve,</p>
</details>

Reid: 是的。而且会有新的高级模式。这是我们工具箱的一部分。现在，它之所以更棘手，尤其是在你使用**OpenAI**时，部分原因在于，嗯，就像成本结构有点改变了。是的。对。目前是这样。是的。不。不。所以你就是不能。这就是为什么在**PayPal**我们不得不改变，就像你知道的，因为你当时离我们很近，我们不得不改变为付费模式，因为我们觉得，哦，看，我们的交易量呈指数级增长，这意味着成本曲线也呈指数级增长，这意味着尽管我们已经筹集了数亿美元，我们仍然可以精确计算出我们将破产的时间，对吧？因为你知道，你不能有一个指数级增长的成本曲线。所以我认为这就是为什么在**AI**领域有些不同，因为你不能有一个指数级增长的成本曲线，而没有至少一个随之而来的收入曲线。

They're raising lots of money but the subscription revenue is baked in from day zero and that's that's the fundament.</p>
</details>

Reid: 但这几乎没有乐趣。就像**Pinterest**。他们现在怎么赚钱？一家大型上市公司。在那个时代有很多这样的公司，现在他们烧了很多钱。他们筹集了很多钱，但订阅收入从第一天就内置了，这就是基础。

<p class="english-text">>> Well, and it's fascinating. Some people have tried sort of different angles on LinkedIn. One that I was curious about a few years ago was sort of this idea of could you get um what's on LinkedIn is rums but not necessarily references. But the same way that résumés are viral, references are like anti or antimatic and people don't want them on the internet. If there was a data set that people wanted on the internet, LinkedIn would have would have done it to some degree. But uh yeah, I think most people who try these attempts don't kind of appreciate um sort of the subtleties of uh</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，这很吸引人。有些人尝试了从不同角度来做**LinkedIn**。几年前我很好奇的一个想法是，你能否获得**LinkedIn**上的简历，但不一定是推荐信。但就像简历具有病毒性一样，推荐信是反病毒的，人们不希望它们出现在互联网上。如果有一个人们希望出现在互联网上的数据集，**LinkedIn**在某种程度上会做到。但，是的，我认为大多数尝试这些的人并没有真正理解其中的微妙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and I've actually I mean we do have the equivalent of book blurb references. Yes. Endorsements.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> You don't have a negative reference.</p>
</details>

>> 你没有负面评价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, but but by the way, part of the reason why negative references is you have complexity in social relationships. That's the negative virality point that you were just making. And then you also have complexity on like you know kind of not just legal liability but social relationships and a bunch of other stuff. Now LinkedIn is still the best way to find a negative reference. I mean that's actually one of the things that that I use LinkedIn to figure out who might know a person</p>
</details>

Reid: 嗯，但顺便说一句，负面评价之所以存在，部分原因在于社交关系的复杂性。这就是你刚才提到的负面病毒性。然后你还有复杂性，比如不仅仅是法律责任，还有社交关系以及其他许多事情。现在**LinkedIn**仍然是找到负面评价的最佳方式。我的意思是，这实际上是我使用**LinkedIn**来找出谁可能认识某人的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and I have a standard email. You've probably gotten a bunch of these from me where I've where I've I email people saying um could you rate this person for me from 1 to 10 or or reply call me. negative. What?</p>

And if you get a set of eight and nines, like you may still call and get some get some information, but you're like, "Okay, I got a I got a quick referential information." Whereas, by the way, more often than not, you know, when you're checking someone you really know, you you get a couple call mess because because my and it's just that quick because email one sentence thing, get back, call me. You're like, "Okay, I understand."</p>

Reid: 对。顺便说一句，有时当一个人回复10分时，你会想：“真的吗？”就像你认识的最好的人，对吧？但你寻找的是一系列8分和9分。是的。如果你得到一系列8分和9分，你可能仍然会打电话并获得一些信息，但你会想：“好吧，我得到了一个快速的参考信息。”然而，顺便说一句，通常情况下，当你核实一个你真正认识的人时，你会收到几个“给我打电话”的信息，因为我的，而且就是那么快，因为邮件一句话，回复，给我打电话。你会想：“好吧，我明白了。”

### AI时代的时间杠杆与友谊的真谛

>> 是的。那太棒了。嗯，我很好奇，Reid，随着你的职业生涯不断升级，拥有更多机会，而且这些机会似乎在复合增长，尤其是在出售**LinkedIn**之后，你如何决定你的时间在哪里能发挥最大的杠杆作用，在哪里能产生最大的影响？你的思维框架是什么？

<p class="english-text">>> you know now within that you know part of that was you know co-founding manusi with Sedart Mukerji who's the CEO emperor uh author of emperor all malades um inventor of um some T- cell therapies. So it's like like for example getting an instruction from him on the FDA process, you know, that's the kind of thing that makes us all run screaming for the hills, right? As a as an instance. Um and so uh you know that kind of stuff, but also um you know like one of the things I think is really important is as technology drives more and more of everything that's going on in society, how do we make government more intelligent on technology? And so, you know, every kind of um, you know, kind of well-ordered western democracy, um, I've done been doing this for at least 20 to 25 years. If if a minister, you know, or kind of senior person from a from a democracy comes and asks for advice, I give it to them. So, you know, just last week, I was in France talking with McCron because he's trying to figure out like, how do I help French industry, French society, French people? What are the things I need to be doing? you know, if all the frontier models are going to be built in the US and maybe China, what does that mean for how I help, you know, our people and so forth and and he's doing the exact right thing, which is I understand that I have a potential challenge. What do I do to help my people?</p>
</details>

Reid: 你知道，现在在其中，你知道，其中一部分是与**西达尔塔·穆克吉**（Siddhartha Mukherjee: 印度裔美国医生、科学家和作家，著有《众病之王》）共同创立**Manifold Bio**，他是《**众病之王**》（The Emperor of All Maladies: 西达尔塔·穆克吉的普利策奖获奖作品，关于癌症的历史）的作者，嗯，一些**T细胞疗法**（T-cell Therapies: 一种利用 T 细胞治疗癌症的免疫疗法）的发明者。所以，举个例子，从他那里获得关于**FDA**（Food and Drug Administration: 美国食品药品监督管理局）流程的指导，你知道，那种事情会让我们所有人尖叫着逃跑，对吧？作为一个例子。嗯，所以，你知道那种事情，但同时，嗯，你知道，我认为真正重要的一件事是，随着技术推动社会中发生的一切越来越多，我们如何让政府在技术方面变得更智能？所以，你知道，每一种，你知道，那种秩序良好的西方民主国家，嗯，我做这件事至少有20到25年了。如果一个部长，你知道，或者一个来自民主国家的高级官员来寻求建议，我就会给他们。所以，你知道，就在上周，我在法国与**马克龙**（Emmanuel Macron: 法国总统）交谈，因为他正在努力弄清楚，我如何帮助法国工业、法国社会、法国人民？我需要做些什么？你知道，如果所有的前沿模型都将在美国和可能在中国建立，那对我如何帮助，你知道，我们的人民等等意味着什么？他正在做完全正确的事情，那就是我明白我有一个潜在的挑战。我该如何帮助我的人民？

<p class="english-text">>> Okay. I'm glad you calm down. One of the ways in which you're able to do that one it's important problems but two you you work on projects with friends sometimes over over decades and you you maybe we'll close here. You've thought a lot about friendship. You've you've you've written about it. You've spoken about it. I'm I'm curious what you found um most remarkable or most surprising um about French where you think more people should appreciate especially as we enter this AI era where people yeah sort of are questioning you know the next generation what's there going to be relationship to friends</p>
</details>

>> 好的。我很高兴你平静下来了。你能够做到这一点的一个原因是这些问题很重要，但第二个原因是，你有时会和朋友一起工作几十年，你，也许我们就在这里结束。你对友谊思考了很多。你写过它。你谈论过它。我很好奇你发现的关于友谊最显著或最令人惊讶的是什么，你认为更多人应该欣赏，尤其是在我们进入这个**AI**时代，人们有点质疑下一代与朋友的关系会是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I actually am going to write a bunch about this specifically because AI is now bringing some very important things that people need to understand which is friendship is a joint relationship it's not a oh you're just loyal to me or oh you just do things for me oh this person does things for me well there's a lot of people who do things for you. Your bus driver does things for you, you know, like like but that doesn't mean that you're friends. Friends, like for example, like a classic way of putting is like, "Oh, I had a really bad day and I show up my friend Alex and I want to talk to him and then Alex like, "Oh my god, here's my day." I'm like, "Oh, your day is much worse." We're going to talk about your day versus my day, right? You know, that's the kind of thing that happens because what I think fundamentally happens with friends is two people agree to help each other become the best possible versions of themselves.</p>
</details>

Reid: 我实际上打算专门写很多关于这个话题的东西，因为**AI**现在带来了一些人们需要理解的非常重要的事情，那就是友谊是一种共同的关系，它不是“哦，你只是忠于我”或者“哦，你只是为我做事”或者“这个人只是为我做事”。嗯，有很多人为你做事。你的公交车司机为你做事，你知道，但这并不意味着你们是朋友。朋友，举个例子，一个经典的说法是，“哦，我今天过得很糟糕，我去找我的朋友Alex，我想和他聊聊”，然后Alex会说，“哦，天哪，这是我的一天。”我会说，“哦，你的一天糟糕多了。”我们会谈论你的一天而不是我的一天，对吧？你知道，这就是会发生的事情，因为我认为朋友之间根本上发生的是两个人同意互相帮助，成为最好的自己。

<p class="english-text">>> how do I help you? But as part of also the thing that I uh I gave the um commencement speech at Vanderbilt a few years back and was on friendship and part of it was to say look part of friends is not just does does Alex help me but Alex allows me to help him right and as part of that that's part of how I become a deeper friend I learn things from it's not just help that helping Alex that joint relationship is really important and you're going to see all kinds of nutty people saying oh I have your AI friend right here. It's like no you don't. It's not a birectional relationship. Maybe awesome companion like just spectacular but it's not a friend. And you need to understand like part of friend is part of when we begin to realize that life's not just about us that we that it's a team sport. We go into it together. Um that sometimes, you know, friendship conversations are wonderful and difficult, you know, and that kind of thing. And I think that's what's really important. And and now that you know we've got this blurriness that AI has created, it's like shoot I have to go write some of this very soon so that people understand how to navigate it and why they should not think about AI anytime soon.</p>

Reid: 我如何帮助你？但作为其中一部分，我还几年前在**范德堡大学**（Vanderbilt University: 美国一所私立研究型大学）做了毕业典礼演讲，主题是友谊，其中一部分是说，看，朋友的一部分不仅仅是Alex是否帮助我，而是Alex允许我帮助他，对吧？作为其中一部分，这就是我如何成为一个更深层次的朋友，我从中学习东西，不仅仅是帮助Alex，那种共同的关系非常重要，你会看到各种各样疯狂的人说：“哦，我这里有你的**AI**朋友。”它就像不，你没有。它不是一种双向关系。也许是很棒的伴侣，非常棒，但它不是朋友。你需要明白，朋友的一部分是我们开始意识到生活不仅仅是关于我们自己，而是一项团队运动。我们一起投入其中。嗯，有时，你知道，友谊的对话是美妙而困难的，你知道，诸如此类。我认为这才是真正重要的。现在，你知道，**AI**创造了这种模糊性，我必须很快写一些关于这个的东西，以便人们理解如何驾驭它，以及为什么他们不应该很快将**AI**视为朋友。

Reid: 作为朋友。嗯，我一直很欣赏你的一点是，你能够和那些与你有分歧的人，或者你知道你几年没有亲近的人成为朋友，但你能够重新联系，你知道，那种能力是……
