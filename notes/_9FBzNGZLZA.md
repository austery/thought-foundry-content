title: 美国牛肉产业的困境：市场集中、进口冲击与牧场主的挣扎
---

### 美国牛肉产业的现状与困境

如今，我们已失去了超过一半的肉牛养殖场，这些养殖场在一个世代前还在经营。我们已经失去了其中52%的养殖场。我们还失去了25%的**母牛群**（Mother Cow Beef Herd: 用于繁殖肉牛的母牛群体）。目前，四大**肉类加工商**（Packers: 将活畜屠宰并加工成肉类产品的企业）控制着大约80%的**市场份额**（Marketplace Share: 企业在特定市场中销售额或产量的占比）。2024年，消费者为牛肉支付的价格约为每磅8.23美元。2021年，加工商和零售商获得了消费者每消费一美元牛肉中的60%以上，即60美分，而生产者获得的不足40美分。那么问题来了：在一个竞争激烈的市场中，这怎么可能发生？市场中的竞争力量如何能完全颠覆整个牛肉供应链中消费者牛肉美元的竞争性分配？这个问题的答案是：不可能。

<p class="english-text">Now, jump ahead today. We've wiped out over half of all the beef cattle operations in business just over a generation ago. We've lost 52% of them. We've wiped out 25% of our mother cow beef herd. And the four largest packers controlled today about 80% of the marketplace. And consumers in 2024 paid about $823 per pound for beef. In 2021, the packer and the retailer received over 60% or 60 cents of every consumer beef dollar and the producer received less than 40 cents. So here's this here's the question. How in a competitive market could that have happened? How could a competitive forces in the marketplace completely reversed the competitive allocation of the consumer beef dollar within the entire beef supply chain? The answer to that question is it can't.</p>

<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Joe，你吃鸡蛋多还是牛肉多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, what do you eat more of? Eggs or [music] beef?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我一直在想，我希望在生活中多吃些牛肉。我可能最终还是吃鸡蛋多，但牛肉就是那么美味。牛肉是全世界最好的食物，我真的这么认为。每次吃牛肉，我都会想为什么我不一直吃呢？它太好吃了，太令人满足了，营养丰富。吃完之后我就没有想吃零食和垃圾食品的冲动了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I was just thinking um I want to eat more beef in my my life. I probably do eat more eggs ultimately, but like beef is just so good. Beef is the best food there is in the entire world. I truly believe that. And every time I eat beef, I think about why don't I eat this all the time? It's so good. It's so satisfying. All these nutrients. I don't have this impulse to snack and eat garbage afterwards.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我想多吃牛肉。

<p class="english-text">I want to eat more beef.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我很确定我现在吃牛肉比鸡蛋多。我偶尔会吃煎蛋卷，也会把很多鸡蛋加到亚洲面条菜肴之类的里面，但不是很多。我渴望过上Tracy Aloay的饮食生活。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm pretty sure I eat more beef than eggs at this point. Like I will have the occasional omelette and I mix a lot of eggs into like Asian noodle dishes and things like that, but not that. I aspire to live the Tracy to have the Tracy Aloay diet.</p>

### 牛肉价格飙升与政治关注

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，正是如此。所以，我相信所有收听这个播客的人现在都听说过美国牛肉价格上涨的事情。最近几天，关于这个话题的头条新闻层出不穷。例如，我们录制这期节目是在10月30日，而本周早些时候，唐纳德·特朗普总统还在推特上发文，表示他希望牛肉价格能降低。他还一直在谈论从阿根廷购买牛肉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, this is exactly it. So, I'm sure everyone listening to this podcast at this point has heard about rising beef prices in the US. There are a lot of headlines flying around constantly in recent days about this. So, for instance, we're recording this on October 30th, and earlier this week, President Trump was tweeting about how he wants beef prices to be lower. He's also been talking about buying beef from Argentina. Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这确实是新闻热点。还有与中国的整个大豆贸易问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it is very much in the news. There's also the whole soybean drama with China.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我觉得很有趣，在特朗普的那篇帖子中，她说，嗯，牧场主应该庆幸现在情况很好，因为牛肉价格很高，但又要降下来。嗯，有很多，我之前在节目中也说过，我认为文明的最终标志是普通人或平均每人工作一小时能买到的牛肉或蛋白质的数量。我认为当这个指标倒退时，我们应该感到非常不安。所以撇开这些不谈，你知道，我很幸运。我可能负担得起我想吃多少牛肉就吃多少。但是碎牛肉的价格，我现在正在终端机上查找。自2010年以来，它已经翻了三倍。在大流行期间大约是4美元，现在超过6美元。我认为这些都是极其严重的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's funny because in that Trump post, she said, uh, cattle ranchers should appreciate how good things are going because high beef prices, but bring them down. Um there is just a lot and I've said this before on the show which is that I think the ultimate marker of civilization is the amount of beef or protein that you can buy with an hour's work that the median person or the average person can buy with an hour's work. And I think when it's going backwards, we should be very disturbed. So setting aside, you know, I'm very fortunate. I could probably afford to eat as much beef as I want. But the price of ground beef, I'm looking it up on the uh terminal now. It's like tripled since 2010. that there's like $4 around the pandemic. Now it's over $6. I think these are extremely serious issues.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我要说的是，我认为我们不需要对蛋白质如此痴迷。特别是美国人，我们已经吃了很多蛋白质了。好吧，多吃些纤维吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say I don't think we need to be quite as obsessed with protein. Americans especially, we already eat a lot of protein. Okay. Eat more fiber.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我不是说我们需要痴迷。实际上，我确实认为蛋白质热潮可能有点失控。我只是认为这是一个衡量富裕社会进步的很好指标，即蛋白质变得更便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not saying we need to be obsessed. Actually, I do think the protein craze may be a little out of hand. I just think this is like a very good measure of the advance of sort of a wealthy society that protein gets more affordable.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我会给你买一份牛股作为圣诞礼物。谢谢你。

<p class="english-text">No one can deny that we're talking to the perfect guest.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。那么，我们从一个非常简单的问题开始吧。你对过去几个月左右的牛肉价格有什么观察？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, why don't we start really simple? What have you observed about beef prices just you know in the past few months or so?</p>
</details>

### 活牛与牛肉价格的“反常”关系

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，正如你所指出的，我们看到牛肉价格在上涨，活牛价格也在上涨。所以，我们现在牛肉价格和活牛价格之间存在正向关系，我们是一个竞争性行业。我们不依赖政府的价格支持。我们是美国农业中最大的单一部门。养牛业每年产生约1000亿美元的现金收入。所以它比任何其他商品都大，比如玉米、小麦、棉花、奶制品。嗯，我们依赖竞争性市场力量，但直到最近我们才拥有竞争性市场力量。这就是我们需要深入探讨牛肉价格为何高昂的历史原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we've seen beef prices increasing as you've indicated and we see cattle pricing also increasing as you indicated. So, we now have a positive relationship between the price of beef and the price of cattle and we are a competitive ind industry. We do not rely on government price supports. We're the single largest segment of American agriculture. The cattle industry gener generates about a hundred billion dollars a year in cash receipts. So it's it's larger than any other commodity. Corn, wheat, cotton, dairy. Um and and we rely on competitive market forces, but we have not had competitive market forces until very recently. And that's where we need to get into the history of why beef prices are high.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我能很快问一下吗？你说现在活牛价格和牛肉价格之间存在正向关系。情况不总是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask very quickly? You said there's now a positive relationship between cattle prices and beef prices. Is that not always the case?</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 当然不是，尤其是在2015年之后。我们看到了**反向关系**（Inverse Relationship: 指两个变量之间呈反方向变化的趋势，一个增加另一个减少）。从2017年开始，我们看到牛肉价格一路飙升。而当牛肉价格上涨时，活牛价格却在下跌。这在一个牛肉的唯一成分就是活牛的行业中，确实非常奇怪。所以你会期望牛肉价格和活牛价格之间存在一种和谐、同步的正向关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That certainly has not been the case, especially since uh 2015. We saw an inverse relationship. We saw beef prices heading skyward beginning in [clears throat] 2017. And while beef prices were increasing, cattle prices were falling. And this is really odd in an industry where the only ingredient in beef is cattle. So you would expect there to be a harmonious synchronous relationship, a positive relationship between beef prices and cattle prices.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这是我在疫情期间在终端机上发现的事情之一。我学到了所有这些东西。我们实际上在终端机上有一个指数，对冲者有**对冲者优势牛肉加工商利润率**（Hedgers Edge Beef Packer Margin: 一种衡量肉类加工商利润率的指标，反映了活牛价格与牛肉产品销售价格之间的差额），我想这在某种程度上反映了这种价差。我们确实看到它总体上在2021年之前都在上涨，实际上它已经开始大幅压缩，但为什么会这样呢？是什么解释了这些东西可以朝不同方向发展？牛肉价格中除了活牛价格之外，还有什么额外的因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things I discovered on the terminal back during the pandemic. I learned all these things. We actually have an in uh index on the um terminal the hedgers have the hedgers edge beef packer margin which I imagine to some extent reflects that spread and um we do see it rise generally up really through 2021 uh it's actually started to compress quite a bit but just actually uh why is that like what what explain uh what explains why these things can move in different directions what is the added factor in the price of beef that is not the price of cattle.</p>
</details>

### 市场集中度演变：从竞争到失衡

**Bill Bullard:** 好的。让我们回到一个世代前，回到1980年。当时，美国有130万肉牛养殖户和牧场主。我们的**母牛群**大约有3700万头。消费者支付的牛肉价格约为每磅2.40美元。当时，行业中最大的四家加工商控制着36%的市场。所以如果我们思考牛肉行业是如何运作的，消费者支付的牛肉美元必须沿着整个供应链进行分配。回到1980年，每当消费者花一美元购买牛肉时，这笔钱都会通过竞争性市场力量进行分配，其中超过60美分会流向活牛生产者、农民、牧场主和育肥牛场。而不到40美分会流向牛肉行业的加工环节，也就是零售商和加工商。所以生产者获得了大部分份额，这是合理的，因为他们饲养动物15到18个月，然后才屠宰并加工成牛肉，而牛肉加工商只饲养动物大约七天，零售商则尽可能短地饲养。但重点是，当消费者为牛肉支付每磅2.40美元时，其中60美分流向了生产者，而不到40美分流向了加工商和零售商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? So let's go back to just over a generation. We'll go back to 1980. Great. At the time we had 1.3 million beef cattle farmers and ranchers in the United States. We had about 37 million cows in our mother cow herd. Beef prices that consumers paid were about $2.40 per pound. And we at that time we had the four largest packers in the industry controlling 36% of the industry. So if we think about how the beef industry works, it's the consumer beef dollar that has to be allocated along the entire supply chain. So back in 1980, every time a consumer spent a dollar on on beef, that dollar was allocated by competitive market forces and over 60 cents of that dollar went back to the live cattle producer, the farmer and rancher and the cattle feeder. And less than 40 cents went back to the processing part of the beef industry, and that's to the retailer and the packer. So the producer was receiving the majority share which made sense because they kept that animal and uh for 15 to 18 months before it was slaughtered and converted to beef and the beef packer only kept the animal for about seven days and the retailer kept it for the shortest amount of period possible. So but the point was is that when consumers were paying $2.40 40 cents per pound for beef. 60 cents of that dollar was going back to the producer and only less than 40 40 cents was going back to the processor and the retailer.</p>
</details>

现在，跳到今天。我们已经消灭了超过一半的肉牛养殖场，这些养殖场在一个世代前还在经营。我们已经失去了其中52%的养殖场。我们还消灭了25%的**母牛群**。目前，四大加工商控制着大约80%的市场份额。2024年，消费者为牛肉支付的价格约为每磅8.23美元。而现在在2020年或2021年，就在几年前，竞争性市场在市场中进行的分配已经完全颠倒了。2021年，加工商和零售商获得了消费者每消费一美元牛肉中的60%以上，即60美分，而生产者获得的不足40美分。那么问题来了：在一个竞争性市场中，这怎么可能发生？市场中的竞争力量如何能完全颠覆整个牛肉供应链中消费者牛肉美元的竞争性分配？这个问题的答案是：不可能。如果我们的市场是竞争性的，那绝不可能发生。这引发了我们过去几十年来一直在努力解决的问题。我们的行业正处于危机之中，而且一直如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now jump ahead today. We've wiped out over half of all the beef cattle operations in business just over a generation ago. We've lost 52% of them. We've wiped out 25% of our mother cow beef herd. And the four largest packers control today about 80% of the marketplace. And consumers in 2024 paid about $823 cents per pound for beef. And now in 2020 or 2021, just a couple years ago, the allocation that the competitive market was making in the marketplace was completely tipped on its head. In 2021, the packer and the retailer received over 60% or 60 cents of every consumer beef dollar and the producer received less than 40 cents. So here's this here's the question. How in a competitive market could that have happened? How could a competitive forces in the marketplace completely reversed the competitive allocation of the consumer beef dollar within the entire beef supply chain? The answer to that question is it can't. If our market was competitive, that could never have happened. That raises the concerns that we've been uh struggling with for the past several decades. Our industry is in a state of crisis, and it has been.</p>
</details>

### 市场失灵的深层原因：集中化与进口冲击

**Bill Bullard:** 发生这种情况的原因是行业集中和整合，跨国肉类加工商和零售商能够在供应链上游施加购买力，以及我们签订了自由贸易协定，允许肉类加工商和零售商从世界各地获取牛肉，从而取代国内生产。因为我们从阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大和墨西哥进口的牛肉，是国内产品的完美替代品。所以我们进口得越多，我们就越没有能力和容量来维持这种非常重要的蛋白质来源——牛肉的国内生产。所以我们今天看到的是一个功能失调的市场。正如我之前描述的，自2017年以来，我们看到消费者在零售店支付的牛肉价格上涨。我们看到活牛价格下跌。最新的普查显示，仅在2017年至2022年的五年间，我们就失去了10.6万个肉牛养殖场。农民和牧场主在此期间退出了这个行业。发生这种情况的原因是他们长期缺乏盈利能力。这是因为他们的市场功能失调。这是因为进口取代了我们的国内生产和我们扩张的机会。而现在我们遭遇了巨大的市场冲击，对市场造成了经济冲击。那就是2020年下半年发生的最新旱灾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what has happened is is because of industry concentration and consolidation, the ability of the multinational meatackers and retailers to exert buying power upstream in the supply chain, and the fact that we've entered free trade agreements that have allowed the meat packers and retailers to access beef from around the world and displace domestic production because the beef that we import from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Costa Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Mexico. It's a perfect substitute for domestic product. So the more we import, the less we have the ability and capacity to maintain domestic production of this very important protein source, which is beef. And so what we see today is a dysfunctional marketplace. As I described before, since 2017, we saw beef prices going up that consumers were paying in the retail store. We saw cattle prices going down. The latest census shows that just in the 5-year period from 2017 to 2022, we lost 106,000 beef cattle operations. Farmers and ranchers exited the industry during that period. And the reason that that's happened is because they've suffered long-term lack of profitability. It's because their market is dysfunctional. It's because imports have displaced our domestic production and our opportunity to expand. And now we've hit a a huge market shock, an economic shock to the market. And that was the latest drought that occurred in the latter part of 20120.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这正是我要问的。所以，我们肯定会更多地谈论行业整合。嗯，你知道，我正在看一个关于沃尔玛通过建立新工厂来加强对牛肉市场的控制的头条新闻。但是，为了暂时扮演一下“魔鬼代言人”，这其中有多少仅仅是由于纯粹的投入成本，比如谷物价格上涨，或者你刚才提到的干旱，或者劳动力成本？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what I was going to ask. So just to we're going to talk more about industry consolidation for sure. And um you know, I'm looking for instance at a headline right now about Walmart tightening its grip on the beef market by setting up a new plant. But just to play devil's advocate for a second, h how much of this is just down to pure input costs like grain going up or you know the drought that you just mentioned or labor costs</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 至少特别是我们过去一年所看到的变化，这显然无法用几十年的趋势来解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at least especially the move that we've seen over the last year which I'm sure which cannot obviously be explained by multi-deade trends</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 靠什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">by what?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 靠几十年的趋势。我相信这是真实存在的。但是，让我们具体谈谈过去一年或过去18个月发生的一些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By multi-de a multi-deade trend I believe that is real etc. But let's talk about some of these things that have happened in the last year specifically or the last whatever 18 months.</p>
</details>

### 投入成本与牧场主的议价能力

**Bill Bullard:** 所以我们看到的是，我们的活牛供应量已降至75年来的最低水平。我们面临着极其紧张的供应状况，但牛肉需求却异常强劲。消费者购买牛肉的意愿似乎没有上限。尽管价格上涨，消费者仍然清空了超市货架上的产品。因此，最近发生的旱灾加速了我们美国肉牛存栏量的持续清算。这就是为什么我们的供应如此紧张。然而，消费者对牛肉的需求却如此旺盛。因此，由于这种强劲的需求，我们看到了价格的飙升。消费者继续愿意为牛肉支付更高的价格。但这并不是我们市场过去十年来的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we've seen is our cattle supplies have tightened to the lowest levels in 75 years. We have extremely tight supply situation but we have incredibly strong beef demand. Consumers willingness to pay for beef appears unbounded. As prices have increased, consumers have still cleared the grocery store shelves with the product. And so the latest the latest drought that occurred had accelerated the ongoing liquidation of our US beef cattle or beef cattle inventory. And and that's why our supplies are so tight. Uh and yet you've got incredible consumer demand for beef. And so we have seen a spike in prices because of that strong demand. Consumers continue to be willing to pay more for beef. And but that is not how our market has been functioning for the past decade.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 假设下雨了，没有干旱了，等等。我们谈论的是一个怎样的时间线？再次强调，撇开结构性问题不谈，我们谈论的是一个现实的时间线，以回到我们认为舒适的活牛存栏水平，我们对我们国家拥有的活牛存栏水平感到满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's say the rain come back, there's no drought, etc. What are we talking about for a timeline? Again, setting aside the structural things, what do we talk about for a realistic timeline for getting back to where we think like, oh, we are comfortable with the level of cattle stock that we we are happy with the level of cattle stock that we have in this country,</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 好的。所以我们目前生产的牛肉比美国消费的牛肉少大约30亿磅。因此，美国农业中最大的部门实际上为国内市场生产不足。由于活牛漫长的生物周期，从决定保留活牛进行繁殖，到产下小牛，再到将小牛饲养到屠宰重量，需要大约三年时间，而饲养到屠宰重量需要15到18个月。因此，为了让我们的行业开始扩张阶段，我们需要一个能够激励生产者投资建设牛群的价格点。不幸的是，这个价格点在2023年左右就出现了。我们现在应该处于积极的扩张阶段，但事实却相反，国内消费者没有依赖美国生产者，我们在2024年将牛肉进口量增加到了创纪录的水平。这正在取代我们的国内生产。而且这种进口的增加在市场上没有区别。消费者无法分辨他们购买的牛肉是外国牛肉还是国内牛肉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? So we currently produce about three billion pounds less beef than what is consumed in America. So the largest segment of American agriculture actually underproduces for the domestic market. And because of the long biological cycle of cattle, it takes about three years to decide to hold back cattle to breed and then to have a calf and then to raise that calf to slaughter weight over a period of 15 to 18 months. And so in order for our industry to begin an expansion phase, uh we would need a price point that incentivizes producers to make the investment to build the herd. And unfortunately that that price point occurred back around 2023. We should be in an aggressive expansion phase now except that instead of uh domestic consumers relying on US producers, we've increased the volume of beef imports to record volumes in 2024. That's displacing our domestic production. And that increase of of imports is not distinguished in the marketplace. Consumers can't tell if the beef they're buying is foreign beef or domestic beef. H</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 这将权力和控制权交给了加工商、进口商和零售商。所以你的问题是，这其中有多少与投入成本的增加有关？嗯，投入成本的增加降低了美国活牛生产者在任何给定价格点获得的利润空间，我们确实看到了生产成本的增加。但重点是，活牛生产者不设定牛肉价格。牛肉价格是由销售给消费者的加工商和零售商设定的。在这个市场中，生产者是**价格接受者**（Price Taker: 指在完全竞争市场中，个体生产者或消费者无法通过自身行为影响市场价格，只能接受市场既定价格），几十年来一直如此。他们有活牛，他们将其出售，他们接受或拒绝加工商的出价，他们生产的是易腐产品。因此，当动物准备好屠宰，准备加工成牛肉产品时，饲养这些活牛的生产者只有一到两周或三周的时间来销售这些动物。否则，它们的质量就会下降，会增加脂肪而不是肌肉。因此，生产者在当前这种高度集中的市场中议价能力非常有限。当他们在一个由四大加工商控制80%市场的市场中销售时，他们是市场权力滥用的受害者，这种滥用源于这种高度集中的营销结构。因此，生产成本的增加降低了生产者的盈利能力，但它不影响生产者销售活牛的能力。活牛的需求被不断增加的进口量所抵消和削弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that puts the power and control in the hands of the packers and the importers and retailers. So your question was how much of this had to do with increase in input costs? Well, the increase in input costs reduces the the margin that US cattle producers receive at at any given price point and we've seen increased production costs certainly. But the point is is that cattle producers do not set the price of beef. This the price of beef is set by the packers and the retailers who sell to the consumer. The producer is a price taker in this market and has been for decades. They have cattle, they offer them for sale, they accept or reject a bid by the packer and they're producing a perishable product. So when an animal is ready for slaughter, ready to be fabricated into a beef product, the producer who fed that cattle has a week or a two to three week window in which to market the animal. Otherwise, it degrades in quality. Uh it adds fat instead of muscle. And as a result, the producer has um very limited bargaining power in a highly concentrated market as we have now. And when they're selling into a market that's controlled where forked packers control 80% of the market, uh they they are uh victims of the abuse of market power that emanates uh inherently from such a highly concentrated marketing structure. So the so the increase production costs reduce the profitability of producers but it doesn't it doesn't affect the producers's ability to market cattle. uh that would be the demand for live cattle and the demand for live cattle is offset and undercut by increased volumes of imports.</p>

### 奶牛产业对牛肉供应的影响

**Tracy Alloway:** 牛肉供应和奶制品行业、奶牛之间有什么关系？我之所以提出这个问题，你看起来很困惑，但我之所以提出这个问题，是因为Joe会厌倦我再次提到这本书，但我一直在读这本70年前关于小规模农业的书。我讨厌人们总是提起他们读过的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the relationship between beef availability and dair the dairy industry dairy cows? So one of the reason I bring it up you look confused but the reason I bring it up is because again Joe's going to get sick of me mentioning this but I've been reading this like 70year-old book on small-cale farming. I hate when people are always bringing up books that they've read.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我知道。这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know. It's crazy.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我总是提到它。不，开玩笑的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Re was bring it up one. No, that's a joke.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 而且，你知道，书中有一章是关于你是否想从事养牛业。所以，无论是为了牛肉而养牛，还是养奶牛。你从中学到的一件事是，每头奶牛通常在某个时候都会变成肉牛。一旦它的产奶量开始下降，它通常就会被卖去屠宰。那么，它们之间的关系或互动是怎样的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, there's a chapter in it about whether or not you want to go into cattle farming. So, or cattle ranching for beef or if you want to raise dairy cows. And one of the things that you learn from this is that every dairy cow usually becomes a beef cow at some point. once it reaches you know once its milk production starts to dry up it usually gets sold for slaughter. So what's what's the relationship or the interaction like there?</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，历史上你描述的是真实的，当奶牛超过其生产寿命时，它们会被作为淘汰动物销售到牛肉供应链中。这是一种非常瘦的肉产品，与我们从专门为牛肉生产的谷饲动物那里获得的更高质量的修剪肉混合在一起。所以牛肉行业和奶制品行业之间没有太多竞争。但最近，随着我们技术和基因能力的提高，我们已经开始饲养更多的雄性奶牛，并将它们引入育肥场进行饲养，它们现在开始在市场上与肉牛养殖户和牧场主竞争，这是我们行业中一个相对较新的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well historically what you described is true as the dairy animals uh have exceeded their production lifespan. They are marketed as call animals into the beef supply chain. And uh it's a very lean meat product that is mixed with the higher quality trim that we obtain over our grainfed animals that are fed in feed lots produced exclusively for beef. So there wasn't much competition between the beef industry and and the dairy industry. But here recently as we've increased our technology and genetic cap abilities uh we have begun to raise uh more male beh dairy animals and are bringing them into feed lots and feeding those animals and they are now beginning to compete with the beef cattle farmer and rancher in the marketplace and this is a relatively recent phenomena uh that's been occurring in our industry.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 等等，为什么会发生这种事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, why is that happening?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，多说一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, say more. Well,</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，发生这种情况是因为将奶牛销售到牛肉供应链中存在利润机会，当然，这会直接与我们美国的农民和牧场主竞争，他们不仅要应对奶牛肉类部门的这种增长，而且已经面临着这种无差异化的廉价进口洪流，这已经对他们在该行业的盈利能力产生了负面影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's happening because there's there's a profit opportunity uh to sell dairy cles into the beef supply chain and uh and of course that will compete directly with our America's farmers and ranchers who not only will have to now compete with this increase in the the dairy beef sector, but they're already dealing with this undifferentiated cheaper import flood uh that has been negatively affecting their p profitability in this industry.</p>
</details>

### 牧场扩张的障碍与“繁荣-萧条”周期

**Tracy Alloway:** 再多说一点，活牛价格上涨了，所以理论上，正如你所说，理论上这应该会激励投资等等。但是，请更多地谈谈牧场主在决定扩大存栏量时面临的一些投入成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">say a little bit more about okay cattle prices have gone up and so in theory that as you said in theory that should uh incentve investment etc but talk a little bit more about some of the input costs that a cattle rancher faces making these decisions to expand this their stock.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 所以，首先一个因素是是否有足够的土地来饲养动物，因为在肉牛行业，动物主要是在草地上饲养的。小牛出生后，它会在草地上吸吮母牛四到六个月，然后才被转移到供应链下游，成为一岁动物，最终被送到育肥场，在那里饲养直到达到屠宰重量。所以投入成本包括运营所需的燃料，包括保持动物健康的兽医费用。它包括维持动物充足牧草供应的土地成本。它包括用于收割干草和谷物以饲养这些活牛的设备成本。而且在许多情况下，它还包括劳动力。然而，美国的大多数家庭农场和牧场就是如此。它们是家庭农场和牧场，试图饲养活牛，它们正在经历投入成本的增加。你知道，我们也可以谈论化肥成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so one of the first factors is the availability of sufficient land to raise the animal because in the beef cattle industry, the animal is primarily raised on grass. uh after an an after a calf is born and it suckles the mother for about four to six months on grass and before it is moved uh downstream in the supply chain to become a yearling animal and ultimately delivered to a feed lot where it's fed until it slaughter weight. And so the input costs include the fuel uh with which to run an operation. It includes the veterary expenses for keeping your animals healthy. It includes the land costs of maintaining sufficient forage supplies for the animal. It includes the cost of equipment to put up hay and grain with which to feed those cattle. Uh and it in many instances it includes labor. However, most of the family farm and ranches here in the United States are just that. their family farms and ranches uh attempting to raise cattle and they they're experiencing increased input costs. You know, we could talk about fertilizer costs too as well,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但最终成本因通货膨胀而增加。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh ultimately the costs have increased due to inflation. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 这挤压了他们在任何价格点获得的利润空间。就行业整合而言，美国基本上有四家牛肉加工的**看门人**（Gatekeepers: 指在市场中拥有强大控制力，能够决定其他参与者能否进入或运营的企业），我们是如何走到这一步的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that squeezes the margin that they receive at whatever price point that they're experiencing. In terms of industry consolidation, the fact that there are basically, you know, four gatekeepers to beef processing in the US, how did we actually get here?</p>
</details>

### 反垄断法与执法困境

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，我们之所以走到这一步，是因为我们在执行美国反垄断法方面松懈了，比如1890年的**谢尔曼法案**（Sherman Act of 1890: 美国第一部反垄断法，旨在禁止限制贸易和垄断行为），以及我认为大约是1914年的**克莱顿法案**（Clayton Act: 旨在补充谢尔曼法案，禁止价格歧视、搭售、合并和兼并等可能减少竞争的行为）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we got here because we were lax in enforcing our US antirust laws, uh, the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act, I think it was about 1914.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 抱歉。上次我们谈论鸡蛋和鸡肉系列时，我们谈了很多反垄断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry. The last time we spoke about uh eggs in a big series about chicken, uh we talked a lot about antitrust,</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 是的，这是一个巨大的问题。事实上，牛肉价格上涨并非巧合，我们刚刚看到一项全国性集体诉讼达成和解，其中两家最大的加工商泰森（Tyson）和嘉吉（Cargill）据称已同意就消费者对牛肉价格操纵的投诉进行和解，金额约为8750万美元。所以，我们的行业存在长达数十年的反垄断法执法不力，这使得肉类加工商在1980年代能够进行所谓的“并购狂潮”。我们看到肉牛行业出现了前所未有的并购量或并购数量。正是通过这个过程，以及反垄断法的缺乏执行，肉类加工商才能够实现这种极高水平的集中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">right? Well, and that's a huge problem. In fact, it's no coincidence that as beef prices are increasing, we just saw a settlement in a national class action suit in which two of the largest packers, Tyson and Cargill, have purportedly agreed to settled the consumer's complaints about beef price fixing to the tune of about 87.5 million. Um, so what we have in our industry is a decadesl long lack of enforcement of antitrust laws that allowed the meatackers back in the 1980s to engage in what was called merger mania. We saw an unprecedented volume or amount of mergers and acquisitions in in the beef cattle industry. And it was through that process and no enforcement of antitrust laws that the meat packers were able to ex uh uh achieve this extremely high level of concentration.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 除此之外，国会早在100多年前就意识到独立的牲畜生产者非常容易受到集中肉类加工商的**垄断买方**（Monopsony Power: 指市场上只有一个主要买家，使其能够控制价格并对供应商施加压力）力量，即购买力的影响。因此，他们通过了所谓的1921年**包装商和畜牧场法案**（Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921: 旨在保护牲畜生产者免受肉类包装商和畜牧场的不公平、欺骗性或歧视性行为侵害）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and in addition to that, Congress realized over 100 years ago that independent livestock producers uh were really vulnerable to the monopsin power, the buying power of the concentrated meat packers. So they passed what was called the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 这项法案旨在确保肉类加工商不仅不能从事反垄断活动，如垄断和价格操纵，而且还规定他们不能从事从生产者那里采购牲畜的不公平行为。因此，这项重要的法案实际上有助于增强美国确保市场上不发生反垄断违规行为的能力，并为独立生产者在受到集中市场不公平或欺骗性对待时提供了追索权。问题是，就像我们的反垄断法一样，这项包装商和畜牧场法案也束之高阁。然而今天，美国农业部尚未颁布必要的规则来实施和执行这项已有100多年历史的包装商和畜牧场法案，该法案旨在保护独立牲畜生产者免受主导牛肉加工商的市场权力滥用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this this was to ensure that the meatackers not only could they not engage in anti- trust activities such as monopolization uh and price fixing, but this act also said they couldn't engage in practices of procuring livestock from producers that was patently unfair. Um, and so this important act actually helped to uh bolster the United States ability to to ensure antirust violations were not incurring in the marketplace and it gave the independent producer recourse in the event that they were treated unfairly or deceptively by the concentrated market. The problem is just like our antirust laws that collected dust on the shelf, so too did the Packers and Stockyards Act. And yet today, the US Department of Agriculture has not promagated the rules necessary in order to implement and enforce this over 100-year-old Packers and Stockyards Act that was intended to protect independent livestock producers from the abuse of market power of the dominant beef packers.</p>

### 牧场主代际传承的危机

**Tracy Alloway:** 牧场主的子女想成为牧场主吗？2023年，科迪·约翰逊（Cody Johnson）出了一首流行的乡村歌曲，名叫《Dirt Cheap》。这首歌的全部前提是关于一个父亲，一个房地产开发商给他提供了所有的土地，他正要收钱，然后他想到他的孩子们将永远无法在这片土地上奔跑，他感到很难过。当我听到这首歌时，我有点愤世嫉俗，我想，是的，但那个女儿长大后会卖掉这片土地，所以这算什么呢？她会搬到大城市去，但你们行业是否存在这样的问题，比如下一代牧场主会说，不，我想把这片土地卖给数据中心，或者我想把这片土地卖给一个住宅区，这样我就可以去纽约市从事金融工作了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do the children of ranchers want to become ranchers? Uh there is a there's a popular country song that came out in 2023 by Cody Johnson called Dirt Cheap. The entire premise of the song is about this dad and he this real estate developer offers him all this land and he's about to take the money and then he gets sad thinking about his kids will never be running around on this and when I hear the song I got a little cynical I was like yeah but that daughter is going to sell the land when she gets older so what's this like she's going to move to a big city but are there issues in your industry of like the next generation of ranchers like no I want to sell this land to a data center or I want to sell this land to a housing subdivision so that I can I go work in finance in New York City.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 当你所在的行业在一个世代的时间里失去了超过一半的参与者时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you have an industry like ours that has lost over half its participants in the course of just over a generation.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 美国农民和牧场主的平均年龄现在超过58岁，这并不令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not unsurprising that the average age of the US farmer and rancher is now somewhere north of 58 years of age.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 我们经常听到关于牧场家庭在经济成本价格挤压下挣扎了几十年的轶事信息。他们的孩子都看在眼里。他们鼓励孩子做除了牧场以外的其他事情。这是一个我们面临的巨大问题，因为这个扩张阶段将要求我们吸引新的进入者，吸引有抱负的肉牛养殖户和牧场主进入这个行业。这并没有发生。尽管我说价格点足以激励扩张，但一年多前，我们并没有扩张。我们没有扩张，因为我们的肉牛生产者最近目睹了活牛价格的彻底崩溃，当时我们大约处于今天的水平。那是在2014年和2015年。当时，我们行业的活牛名义价格达到了历史最高水平。牛肉消费者当时支付的牛肉名义价格也达到了历史最高水平。所有分析师，无论是政府还是私人，都说肉牛生产者将再获得三年的非常强劲的价格，因为活牛的生物周期很长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of and we hear anecdotal information all the time about ranch families who have struggled under a economic cost price squeeze for decades. their children have watched. They've encouraged their children to do something else other than to ranch. And that's a huge problem that we have because part of this expansion expansion phase will require us to attract new entrance to attract aspiring cattle farmers and ranchers into the industry. That's not happening. And even though I said that the price point has was sufficient to incentivize the expansion uh over a year ago, we're not expanding. And we're not expanding because our cattle producers have recently witnessed a complete collapse in cattle prices when we were about where we're at today. And that was just as recently as 2014 and 15. At that time, we had the highest nominal cattle prices in the history of our industry. And beef consumers were then paying the highest nominal beef prices in history. And every analyst, government and private alike, said the cattle producer is going to receive another three years of very strong prices because of that long biological cycle.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这对我来说是一个非常重要的数据点。牧场主基本上已经被训练成预期高价不一定会持续下去，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a very, this strikes me as a very important uh data point. The fact that the rancher has been trained essentially to expect that high prices won't necessarily sustain themselves, right? You could</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 繁荣-萧条。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the boom bust.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，繁荣-萧条。我们在各个行业都谈论这个问题。价格高是好事，但三年后，当那头牛准备好出售肉类时，价格还会那么高吗？仅仅暂时的高价是不够的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the boom bust. We talk about this across industries. It's like great that the price is there, but are is the price going to be there in three years when uh that when that cow is ready to be sold for meat? It's a very it's it's not enough to just have temporarily high prices.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，是的，正是如此。这正是2014年底发生的事情。2015年，当所有人都认为我们的活牛价格会保持强劲时，它们却莫名其妙地崩溃了。而且它们崩溃的速度和程度都超过了历史上的任何时候。它们一直崩溃，直到2017年，突然间消费者需求推动牛肉价格上涨，而肉类加工商为活牛支付的价格却越来越低。所以我们市场出现了这种完全功能失调的**反向关系**，生产者遭受了损失。正是在2017年至2022年期间，我们失去了10.6万名生产者。直到现在，在最近的这次干旱之后，我们才将牛群规模缩小到如此低的水平，才看到活牛价格开始再次对行业中潜在的竞争力量做出有利的反应。它们开始追逐牛肉价格上涨，我们最近几个月，随着牛肉价格上涨，我们更敏锐地看到了这一点。但事实是，我们没有执行反垄断法。我们现在需要做的是确定今天的牛肉价格在多大程度上是由市场中的反垄断行为造成的。不是来自市场中的价格接受者——活牛生产者，而是来自实际控制美国牛肉市场的跨国牛肉加工商和零售商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, well, that's right. And that's exactly what happened at the end of 2014. In 2015, when everyone believed that our cattle prices would stay strong, they inexplicably collapsed. And they collapsed further and faster than any time in history. And they collapsed until we hit that point of 2017 when suddenly consumer demand was driving beef prices higher and the meat packers were paying less and less for cattle or cattle prices. And so we had this inverse completely dysfunctional situation in the marketplace and producers were hurting. That's the period we lost 106,000 producers from 2017 to 2022. And only now after this latest drought that we shrunk the herd size to such an ultra- low level have we seen the cattle prices begin to once again respond favorably to the latent forces of competition in the industry. They began to chase beef prices upward and we've seen that uh more acutely here in the last couple few months uh as beef prices have increased. But the the fact is is that we have not enforced antitrust laws. And what we need to do now is determine to what extent are today's beef prices caused by antirust behavior in the marketplace. Not from the cattle producer who's a price taker in the marketplace, but by the multinational beef packers and retailers that are actually controlling the beef market here in the United States.</p>

### “鸡肉化”威胁：沃尔玛与牛肉产业的垂直整合

**Tracy Alloway:** 那么，说到这一点和扩张，我们确实看到了一些新的进入者，新的企业进入牛肉行业。我之前提到了沃尔玛。这背后的想法是什么？这仅仅是**垂直整合**（Vertical Integration: 指企业将供应链中不同阶段的业务整合到一起，例如从生产到加工再到零售）的策略，还是像沃尔玛这样的公司进入牛肉行业有什么额外的好处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speaking of that and expansion, one thing we have seen is new entrance, new corporate entrance moving into the beef industry. And I mentioned Walmart earlier. What's the thinking behind that? Is it just a vertical integration play or what's the additive for a company like Walmart to get into beef?</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，想想我们所有的畜牧业部门。所以，我们从家禽部门开始。那个部门在60年代和70年代实现了从鸡蛋到餐桌的**垂直整合**。是那些公司，我们称之为整合商，控制着生产。农民拥有他们的农场和牧场。他们投资了资本，但整合商决定了农民如何饲养那些鸡。事实上，整合商拥有这些鸡，并实质上雇佣农民为他们饲养。这种模式在80年代和90年代被应用到我们的生猪部门。回到1980年，我们有130万活牛生产者，我们还有66.7万生猪生产者分散在美国各地饲养生猪。但今天我们只剩下6.5万。我们消灭了90%的生猪生产者，因为那个行业，参与那个行业的公司开始遵循“鸡肉模式”。所以我们减少了参与者的数量，他们开始在高度集中的情况下饲养生猪，并且它完全实现了从出生到餐桌的垂直整合。活牛行业是这些主要的全球肉类加工商的最后一片**前沿阵地**（Last Frontier: 指某个领域中尚未被充分探索或开发的部分）。嗯，正是由于活牛对饲料的需求和漫长的生物周期，阻止了他们从事我们称之为“**鸡肉化**”（Chickenization: 描述一种农业产业模式，其中大型企业通过合同控制农民的生产过程，农民成为其雇佣的生产者而非独立经营者）的垂直整合模式。我们正在努力阻止活牛行业的“鸡肉化”。嗯，沃尔玛之所以进入这个行业，是因为它有利可图。所以沃尔玛决定要垂直整合肉牛行业。它将指导农民和牧场主必须使用什么基因来饲养动物。沃尔玛将规定生产实践和饲养方式，然后沃尔玛将为生产者提供营销渠道，然后沃尔玛将把由此产生的牛肉产品销售给消费者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you think about our all of our livestock sector. So, we'll start with the poultry sector. That sector was vertically integrated in the 60s and 70s from egg to plate. It's the corporations, what we call the integrators were controlling the production. The farmers own their farms and ranchers. They invested in the capital, but the integrators dictated how the farmers would raise those chickens. In fact, the integrator owned the chickens and essentially hired the uh farmer to raise them for for the integrator. That model was then applied in the 80s and 90s to our hog sector. Back in 1980 when we had 1.3 million cattle producers, we also had 667,000 hog producers scattered all across the United States raising hogs. Uh but today we're down to 65,000. We wiped out 90% of our hog producers because that industry, the corporations involved in that industry began to follow the chicken model. And so we reduced the number of participants and they began to raise hogs under a highly concentrated situation and it's completely vertical vertically integrated from birth to plate. The cattle industry is the last frontier frontier for these major global meatackers. Uh and it's because of the forage requirements and the long biological cycle of cattle that has has prevented them from engaging in the vertical integration model which we call chickenization. and we're trying to prevent the chickenization of our cattle industry. Uh but the reason Walmart's getting into it is because it's profitable. So Walmart has decided it's going to vertically integrate the beef cattle industry. It's going to direct what genetics a farmer rancher has to uh use in order to raise the animal. Walmart will dictate the production practices and feeding and then Walmart will provide the marketing outlet for the producers and then Walmart will sell that resulted beef product to the consumer.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这真的是“鸡肉化”。基本上是**锦标赛制度**（Tournament System: 一种合同养殖模式，农民根据其生产效率在与其他农民的比较中获得报酬，通常对农民不利）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It really is chickenization. It's the tournament system basically.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，它将导致那样。所以，**锦标赛制度**是一种定价机制，它极大地有利于整合商，并允许他们从农民那里购买鸡肉，并以更低的价格支付他们饲养鸡肉的管理技能。嗯，这是我们对沃尔玛模式的担忧。沃尔玛希望锁定牛肉行业的这个细分市场，他们希望淘汰所有这些已经被淘汰的肉牛生产者。生猪生产者在生猪行业被淘汰了，家禽生产者也被淘汰了。这个过程的第一步是取消，你取消了竞争性的现金市场。这就是让他们能够垂直整合一个行业的原因。我们正在活牛行业看到这一点。我们的现金市场正在以惊人的速度萎缩。如果我们允许这种情况继续下去，我们很快就会看到更多的垂直整合。这意味着我们将掏空美国各地的农村社区，就像我们过去四十年一直在做的那样。这是因为我们将通过取消他们的现金市场，通过瓦解竞争性基础设施，并将行业简单地交给一个高度集中、高度集中的牛肉加工和零售行业，从而消除我们独立的家庭农场和牧场主的盈利机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and it will lead to that. So, the tournament system is a pricing mechanism that greatly benefits the integrator and allows them to buy the chickens from the farmer and pay less for their managerial skills in raising the chicken for them. Um, and that's that's a concern we have with the Walmart model. Walmart wants to lock up uh this segment of the beef industry and they want to eliminate u all these cattle producers just have been eliminated. Hog producers were eliminated in the hog industry and poultry producers were eliminated. And the first step in the process is you do away with you eliminate the competitive cash market. That's what allows them to vertically integrate an industry. And we're seeing in that in the cattle industry. Our cash market has been shrinking at an alarming rate. And as we allow this to continue, we will soon see even more vertical integration. What this means is we're going to hollow out rural communities all across America just as we have been doing for the past four decades. And that's because we will eliminate profitable opportunities for our independent familycale farmers and ranchers uh by eliminating their cash market by dismantling the competitive infrastructure and simply handing the industry over to a highly sens centralized highly concentrated beef packing and retailing industry.</p>

### 贸易政策争议：关税、进口与原产地标签

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我将进入一些敏感领域。我不知道你的政治倾向如何。我也不特别关心。没关系。话虽如此，我认为，你知道，我有一些刻板印象，我想如果我设想典型的肉牛牧场主，他们的政治立场如何，戴着牛仔帽，说着乡村口音，我就会对他们在典型选举中的投票方式有一个预设，再次强调，不是指你个人，但你知道，我有我的刻板印象，等等。而且它们可能是真实的。现任政府，你知道，他一直在通过他的Truth Social账户与你们交流。他希望降低价格，但也希望你们感谢高价。有点不清楚。现任政府对独立的肉牛牧场主友好吗？嗯，独立的肉牛生产者需要的是对我们的进口进行管理，而不是将随意采购进口量的能力交给肉类加工商，以取代我们的国内生产，阻止我们的国内生产跟上人口增长，这正是这里发生的情况。所以我们需要的是对那些长期对美国保持贸易顺差的国家实施**关税**（Tariffs: 对进口商品征收的税费，旨在保护国内产业或增加政府收入）和**关税配额**（Tariff Rate Quotas: 一种贸易政策工具，对特定数量的进口商品征收较低关税，超出该数量则征收较高关税）。换句话说，我们从这些国家购买大量牛肉，但我们向它们销售的却很少。所以我们一直在呼吁实施关税和关税配额，关税配额当然是对任何国家可以出口到美国的牛肉数量的限制。

<p class="english-text">Uh I'm going to ve veer into some sensitive territory here. I don't know anything about how you lean politically. I also don't particularly care. It's fine.

Has the current administration, you know, talking he's been talking to you guys via his truth social account. He wants to to lower prices but also appreciate him for the high prices. A little unclear. He was this current administration uh been a friend to the uh to the independent cattle rancher. Well, what independent cattle producers needed is they needed our imports to be managed, not to hand to the meat packers the ability to source whatever volume of imports they want to displace our domestic production to prevent our domestic production from keeping up with growth growth in population, which is what has occurred here. And so what we needed was uh the implementation of tariffs and tariff rate quotas on countries that persistently maintain a trade surplus with with the United States. In other words, countries from which we buy large volumes of beef, but we sell to them very little. So we have been calling for tariffs and tariff rate quotas and tariff rate quotas of course are limits on the volume of beef that any country can um export to the United States.</p>

**Bill Bullard:** 所以，当特朗普总统开始他的第二个任期时，他做的第一件事就是征收关税。对于一个国内市场生产不足的行业，我们需要关税来为我们的行业提供扩张和增加生产的空间。所以我们强烈支持关税。当我们在2025年甚至去年看到巴西进口量绝对爆炸式增长时，我们很庆幸总统对巴西牛肉出口征收了50%的关税，因为那将进一步使我们的行业充斥着这些压低价格的进口产品。嗯，所以当总统宣布这个想法，通过增加阿根廷的牛肉进口配额来降低消费者牛肉价格时，我们认为他被误导了。他对市场结构如何运作不了解。我认为他不知道我们的行业刚刚经历了多年的价格低迷，而消费者却在经历创纪录的牛肉价格。我认为他不明白反垄断执法不力对我们的行业造成了多么严重的不利影响，并导致我们的行业萎缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when President Trump uh took his second term, that's the first thing he began doing was imposing tariffs. And for an industry that underproduces in the domestic market, we need the tariffs to provide our industry the space to expand and increase production. So we strongly supported the tariffs. When we saw Brazilian imports absolutely explode in 2025 and even last year, we were thankful that the president imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian uh exports of beef because that that was going to further keep our industry a wash in these price depressing imports. [clears throat] Uh so but when the president announced this u idea to lower consumer beef prices with by increasing Argentinian Argentina's beef uh import quoter rate we believe that he was misguided. He was misinformed as to how the market structure worked. I don't think he was aware that our industry has just gone through years of depressed prices while consumers were experiencing record beef prices. I don't think he understood how severe the lack of antitrust enforcement has adversely affected our industry and caused our industry to shrink.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 因此，生产者现在非常非常担忧，因为我们正处于应该扩张的价格点。但我们没有像应该那样扩张，因为担心我们行业中尚未纠正的市场失灵。这是因为我们不再确定总统是否真的会开始管理这些进口，或者他是否会继续让这些加工商进口他们想要的任何数量的牛肉和活牛，以取代我们的国内生产。他们这样做却没有告知消费者牛肉的来源。进口牛肉产品上没有**原产地标签**（Country of Origin Labeling, COOL: 要求零售商标明某些食品（如肉类）的原产国）。因此，消费者无法选择支持国内供应链还是国外供应链。这就是为什么我们敦促国会立即通过强制性原产地标签法案。我认为这将至少有助于减轻阿根廷进口增加对我们行业的负面影响，因为这样我们就可以向消费者宣传，请他们选择更高质量的美国生产牛肉，并支持美国肉牛养殖户和牧场主。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so, uh, producers are very, very concerned right now because we're at the price point where we should be expanding. But we're not expanding as we should be because of the concern for the uh, market failure in our industry that has not been corrected. It's because we're not certain anymore whether the president is in fact going to begin to manage these imports or if he was just going to let these packers continue to import whatever volume of beef and cattle they want to displace our domestic production. And they do this without informing consumers where that beef is from. There is no country of origin label on the imported beef product. So consumers can't choose to support the domestic supply chain versus the foreign supply chain. And that's why we're urging Congress to pass mandatory country of origin labeling immediately. And I think this will help to at least mitigate the negative impact that increased imports from Argentina will have on our industry because then we can go to the consumer and ask them them to choose the higher quality USA produced beef and support US cattle farmers and ranchers.</p>

### 消费者权益与市场失灵

**Tracy Alloway:** 听着，我完全理解你的意思，但是，你知道，我住在纽约市，我有孩子要养，我的一个孩子非常喜欢牛肉，而且绝大多数美国人绝不是牧场主。所以，你知道，我理解你有一个你所代表的选民群体。你想为他们争取。为什么绝大多数作为牛肉消费者的国民不应该从更高的活牛价格中受益，不应该从更高的牛肉价格中受益？我们为什么不应该支持这些趋势，无论是进口渠道，还是沃尔玛，坦率地说，沃尔玛在几乎所有进入的品类中都有长期压低价格的历史。他们是著名的低成本卖家。我们为什么不应该支持这些趋势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I totally get where you're coming from, but I, you know, I live in New York City and I have children to feed and one of my children loves beef a lot and the vast majority of Americans are not um cattle ranchers um by any stretch. So, like what is the you know, again, I understand that you have a uh constituency that you represent. You want to make your case. Why should the ent the vast majority of the country which are beef consumers get no benefit from higher cattle prices, get no benefit from higher beef prices? Why shouldn't we want the either imports uh channel or the Walmart, which frankly has a long history of driving prices down in almost any category they enter. They're sort of famously a lowcost uh seller. Why shouldn't we support these trends?</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 嗯，看看美国经济中的任何其他部门。例如，我们确实从中国进口大量商品，消费者可以去杂货店看到贴有中国产品标签的中国价格产品，或者他们可以购买美国产品，通常美国产品会更贵。但消费者有选择权。如果他们愿意，他们可以选择购买更便宜的产品。现在跳到牛肉行业。消费者没有选择权。产品是无差异化的。肉类加工商从澳大利亚、新西兰以及我之前提到的20个不同国家进口这些牛肉。他们进口的价格比我们在这里生产的便宜，但上面没有标签。上面有的是美国检验贴纸，这让不知情的消费者相信，嗯，那一定是国内产品。因此，由于消费者无法在更便宜的外国产品和更昂贵的美国生产产品之间做出选择，消费者没有获得价格节省，因为加工商和零售商会以相同的价格出售，因为他们不必区分。所以他们通过在世界上最富裕的牛肉消费市场——美利坚合众国，低买高卖来获取更高的利润。这只是我们功能失调市场的一个例子。消费者并没有从这些增加的进口量中受益。相反，这些增加的进口量降低了对我们国内活牛的需求，在过去四十年中，导致数十万活牛生产者退出这个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, look at any other sector in the American economy. So we do import large volumes of goods from China for example and a consumer can go to the grocery store and see a chinapriced product labeled as China product or China or they could buy a USA product and typically the USA product is going to cost more. But consumers have a choice. They can choose to purchase the cheaper product if they want to. Now jump to the beef industry. Consumers have no choice. The product is undifferentiated. The meat packers are importing this beef from Australia, New Zealand, and these 20 different countries I talked about earlier. They're importing them cheaper than what we can produce it here, but there's no label on it. What there is on it is a US inspection sticker, leading unsuspecting consumers to believe, well, that must be a domestic product. And so because the consumer can't choose between the cheaper foreign product and the more expensive USA produced product, there's no price saving for the consumer because the packers and the retailers will price it identical because they don't have to distinguish it. So they pocket the increased profitability of buying low and selling high in the most affluent beef uh consuming market in the world and that's the United States of America. That's that's just an example of our dysfunctional market. Consumers have not benefited from these increased volumes of imports. Instead, these increased volumes of imports have reduced demand for our domestic cattle, driving hundreds of thousands of cattle producers out of the industry over the past four decades.</p>

### 新加工商进入市场的壁垒

**Tracy Alloway:** 我能开一家牛肉加工厂吗？为什么我不能进入这个行业？看起来这是一个非常有利可图的生意。当然，如果你是JBS或类似的公司，你似乎赚了很多钱。为什么我们没有新的进入者？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I start a beef processing plant? Why why can't I go into it? Like, it seems like a very profitable business. Certainly, if you're a JBS or someone like that, you seem to be making a lot of money. Why don't we have new entrance?</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 所以，你有四家加工商控制着80%的育肥牛市场，这意味着他们也控制着大约80%的盒装牛肉市场，这意味着他们与主要零售商签订了长期和短期合同。他们在这些零售商那里有货架空间。所以，如果你是一家试图起步的小型加工厂，当你在一个高度集中整合的市场中营销时，你将如何销售你的牛肉？在这个市场中，零售商与最大的主导全球牛肉加工商签订了长期合同。你将如何进入市场？所以，我们有很多小型肉类加工商试图起步。这需要巨大的资本投入。尽管如此，政府实际上在前一届政府期间一直在鼓励他们的增长和发展。但是他们正在挣扎。他们挣扎的原因是他们很难销售他们的产品，即使他们销售的是高质量的产品。他们正在进入一个商品化的市场，优势落在了肉类加工商手中。所以，除非我们执行我们的市场反垄断法和公平竞争法，否则我们将继续看到这些新兴企业在寻找有利可图的产品销售渠道方面遇到严重困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have four packers controlling 80% of the fed cattle market, meaning they also control about 80% of the box beef market, meaning they've got long-term and short-term contracts with the major retailers. They have shelf space with those retailers. So, if you're a small packing plant trying to get started, how are you going to market your beef when you're marketing into such a highly concentrated consolidated market that has where the retailer has long-term contracts with the largest dominant global beef packers? How are you going to access a marketplace? So, we've had lots of smaller meat packers try to start up. It it requires a huge capital outlay to do so. Nevertheless, uh the government actually during the past administration has been encouraging their growth and development. Uh but they're struggling. They're struggling because they have difficulty in marketing their product even if they're marketing a a high quality product. They're marketing into a commodity structured marketplace and the advantage falls to the meat packers. So until and unless we enforce our our market our antitrust laws and our fair competition laws, we will continue to see these upstart experiencing severe difficulty in in finding a profitable marketing outlet for their product.</p>

### 动物蛋白需求增长与美国牛肉产业的未来

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你知道，就像我说的，我真的很喜欢牛肉。现在每个人都喜欢蛋白质。我们最近在另一集节目中谈论过这个问题。蛋白质真的很热门。特别是动物蛋白真的很热门。有很多网红和播客主持人会说多吃红肉之类的话，我们对红肉的态度也改变了。我小时候，红肉是可怕的，要少吃。现在却说红肉是你能吃到的最健康的食物。我不知道这是否是真的，但很多人会这么说。嗯，我们支付的价格，无论是活牛价格，还是碎牛肉或牛排的最终价格，有多少是关于人们饮食中想要更多动物蛋白的长期趋势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I like I said, I really like beef. Everyone's into protein these days. We we talked about this recently on another episode. Protein is really hot. Um animal protein in particular is really hot. There's a lot of influencers and people have podcasts and they say things like eat more red meat and our attitudes about red meat have changed. When I was growing up that was scary of don't cut back on your red meat. Now it's like oh red meat is like the healthiest thing you can eat. I don't know if that's true but a lot of people would say that. um how much of the prices that we pay whether it's for the price of cattle or the uh end price of uh ground beef or whatever or steak is about the secular trend towards people wanting to have more animal protein in their diets.</p>
</details>

**Bill Bullard:** 当然。所以，我认为这是一个巨大的因素。我认为有许多因素导致消费者对牛肉的需求增加和支付更高价格的意愿。我认为问题的答案就在其中。如果我们执行我们的反垄断法，让市场信号在我们的行业中流动，我们将开始扩张，我们的生产将很快与消费者需求达到平衡，我们将看到价格回落。事实上，如果消费者不愿意支付目前的牛肉价格，他们就会转向其他蛋白质来源，如羊肉、鸡肉和猪肉。你就会看到零售商的价格点开始下降，你就会看到牛肉高价回落。但如果政府导致这种情况发生，如果政府干预并迫使活牛需求下降，我们将不会增加美国牛群的规模，美国将越来越依赖外国牛肉来源。目前，2024年，美国市场上所有牛肉中约有22%是进口产品。如果我们看看我们的姊妹行业——羊肉行业，这正是我们的活牛行业正在发展的方向，2024年美国消费的所有羊肉中，73%来自澳大利亚和新西兰。我们已经摧毁了我们的国内羊肉行业。现在政府又把目光投向了活牛行业，在市场上没有任何产品差异化的情况下增加进口，只会加剧我们活牛生产者在参与者数量、活牛数量和营销渠道方面的持续萎缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So I I I think it's a huge factor. I think there are a number of factors contributing to the consumer's increased demand and willingness to pay more for beef. And I think therein lies the answer to the problem. If we enforce our anti antitrust laws and let the market signals flow in our industry, we will begin to expand and our uh production will soon hit an equilibrium with the consumer demand and we would see prices subside. In fact, if consumers are unwilling to pay current prices for beef, they would shift to other protein sources like like lamb, chicken, and pork. and you would see the price point from the retailers begin to fall and you would see uh the high beef prices subside and then uh actually but if the government causes this to happen, if the government interferes and forces the demand for live cattle to decline, we're not going to increase the size of our US cattle herd and America will become increasingly dependent on foreign sources for the beef. Right now at 2024 about 22% of all the beef available in the US market was imported product. And if we look at our ship our sister industry the sheep industry which is the direction our cattle industry is going in 2024 73% of all the lamb consumed in America came from Australia New Zealand. We've we've decimated our domestic sheep industry. Now we're now government has its sights on the cattle industry and increasing imports without any product differentiation in the marketplace will simply exacerbate the ongoing shrinking of our cattle producer in terms of the number of participants, number of cattle, and the number of marketing outlets.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** Joe。这真的很有趣，而且肯定与我们做的鸡肉系列密切相关。嗯，而且，它似乎是贯穿农业的“鸡肉化”主题。我之前没有意识到奶牛养殖基本上是农业的最后一片**前沿阵地**。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Joe. That was really interesting and definitely, you know, closely related to the chicken series that we did.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我也没有。老实说，我本来以为它或多或少已经那样了。我实际上认为沃尔玛的事情非常有趣，因为一方面人们看待沃尔玛这样的实体，觉得它是一个**垄断买方**，它将拥有如此大的权力。另一方面，你说这是一个新的市场进入者。这就像是市场变得更具竞争力了。我认为这对于那些想思考市场竞争的人来说是一个有趣的直觉检验，当你读到沃尔玛将进入牛肉加工业的头条新闻时，你会认为这是坏事还是好事？因为你问为什么没有更多的进入者？好吧，这是一个新的进入者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">either. And I to be honest, I would have already assumed it had been more or less on that. I actually think the uh the Walmart thing is uh very interesting because um on the one hand people look at an entity like Walmart and it's like here's this monopsiny player. It's going to drive so much power. On the other hand you say here is a new market entrance. This is it's like here is the market has just gotten more competitive. I think it's an interesting gut check for people who want to like think about like market competition that when you read a headline Walmart is going to get into beef processing. Do you read that as like bad or good? Because you asked why aren't there more entrance? Well, here's a new entrant coming in.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。嗯，我想说的是，我确实在沃尔玛购物，但我通常是为了批量购买牛肉。如果我想要真正好的牛肉，我就会去康涅狄格州的一个独立农场，那里有很多。我意识到并不是每个人都有这种奢侈。我会努力买到好的牛肉。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, what I would say is I do shop at Walmart, but I shop at Walmart generally for bulk beef. And if I'm looking for the really good stuff, I will go to an independent farmer, of which there are many in Connecticut, and I realize like not everyone has that luxury. And I will try to get the good beef.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。不，我认为，嗯，我喜欢谈论动物产业经济学。有很多紧张关系。我还要说一件事，你知道，我问过那个问题，为什么我们应该关心牛肉消费群体，也就是这个国家绝大多数的牛肉消费群体。美国过去在食品方面有很大的贸易顺差。直到最近几年才转为逆差。嗯，这对我来说可能是一个担忧的来源，就是我们不再能够在国内满足我们所有的食物需求。
