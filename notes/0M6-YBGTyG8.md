### 震动器指南的走红

**Rosie Garren**: 大家好，我是 Rosie。情人节快到了，无论你是否庆祝，空气中都弥漫着爱意。所以，我们想重温一期我们最受欢迎的节目：**震动器**专题。这一集充满了关于寻找适合你或你爱人的震动器的绝佳建议和推荐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Hey there, it's Rosie. Valentine's Day is coming up this week and whether you celebrate or not, love is in the air. So, we wanted to reair one of our all-time favorite episodes, the vibrator episode. This one is chalk full of great tips and recommendations for finding a vibrator that will suit you or the person you love.

</details>

**Christine Zerette**: 我脸都红了。我现在感觉自己好不成熟。我一直对这一集既害怕又超级期待，因为我觉得它会非常棒且有趣。但我也知道，我的家人可能会听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Zerette**: Christine, you're blushing. I totally blushing. I feel so immature right now. I've kind of been dreading but super looking forward to this episode because I think it's going to be great and I think it's super interesting. But I also know that maybe my like family is going to listen.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 没错，今天我们要聊的是震动器。顺便说一下，这是 **Wirecutter** 网站上有史以来最受欢迎的指南之一。人们对这份指南趋之若鹜，它几乎一年到头都排在阅读榜的前列。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: That's right. We are talking about vibrators. And by the way, one of the most popular guides on the Wirecutter site all time. People cannot get enough of this guide. It is way way up at the top of what people read on Wirecutter all year long, almost every day of the year.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 我觉得这反映了一些更深层的东西。坦白说，互联网上缺乏经过严格测试、可靠且直截了当的震动器评论。我们的作者为这份指南测试了大量的震动器，并邀请了广泛的人群参与测试。我们是用评测 **KitchenAid** 搅拌机或滚轮行李箱的严谨态度来对待它的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: I mean, we are laughing, right? But it's also I think it points to something much deeper. Honestly, I think there's a real hunger for this kind of straight review on vibrators, well-tested, well vetted options. And I feel like there's just not a lot of great sources for that on the internet. And our writer has tested so many vibrators for this guide and tested with a wide group of people. It's through the Wirecutter lens. I mean, that's at the end of the day, right? It's given the sort of same treatment that KitchenAid mixers or rollway suitcases are.

</details>

### 弥合“高潮差距”

**Rosie Garren**: 今天我们要请来 Wirecutter 性玩具报道的 MVP，我们的资深作者 **Bianca Alba**。Bianca 是一位非二元性别性健康教育者，拥有公共卫生硕士学位，自 2014 年起就一直在编写我们的震动器指南。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Today we're going to talk with Bianca Alba and they're going to tell us about the hang-ups people have when it comes to sex toys and how they test for our guide. Bianca Alba is a non-binary sexual health educator with a master's in public health and also works as a coach and journalist. They're Wirecutter's sex toy writer, working on our guide to vibrators since 2014.

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 谢谢邀请我。当人们发现我的职业是评测性玩具时，最常见的反应是咯咯笑、尴尬，或者觉得我在挑逗他们。但当他们听说我是为《**纽约时报**》工作时，他们会震惊地问：“《纽约时报》居然还做这个？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Hi, thanks for having me. What is the most common reaction that you get when people find out you review sex toys for a living? Giggly, discomfort, or sometimes they think I'm being provocative or seductive and it's like, no, this is really my job. And then when they find out that I'm doing it for New York Times, they're like, "The New York Times does what?" You know, there's this kind of like shock.

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 为什么这份指南如此受欢迎又充满争议？因为男性性行为和女性性行为之间存在双重标准。讨论 **Viagra**（万艾可）或避孕套并不那么禁忌，但一旦涉及专门为拥有**外阴**（vulva）的人提供**阴蒂高潮**（clitoral orgasm）的产品，人们就会觉得不舒服。对我来说，这份指南的核心是弥合“**高潮差距**”（orgasm gap）。研究显示，75% 拥有外阴的人（主要是异性恋女性）无法仅通过插入式性行为获得高潮，她们需要直接的阴蒂刺激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: There is a real double standard about male sexuality. I mean because there's a lot of discussion of stuff like Viagra and condoms are not so taboo to discuss but the idea that there is a product that is specifically just to give a person with a vulva a clitoral orgasm is like oh no it's either funny or uncomfortable or titilating when I think it's really just a part of health. For me, what this guide is really about is closing the orgasm gap. Like research has shown that 75% of people with vulvas, namely heterosexual women, are not going to be able to have an orgasm just from penetrative sex. And a vibrator is a very effective way to close the orgasm gap.

</details>

### 震动器的多样类型

**Rosie Garren**: 震动器是给谁用的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Who are vibrators for?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 广义上讲，震动器不仅仅是给拥有外阴的人用的。它们可以用于乳头刺激或按摩。**Magic Wand** 最初就是作为按摩器诞生的。现在市场上也出现了越来越多可以用于阴茎或其他身体部位的震动器。甚至还有不震动的玩具，比如**吸吮式玩具**（suction toys）、敲击式玩具或摆动式玩具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Broadly speaking, vibrators aren't just for people with vulvas. The guide that I've written up to this point has been focused on vibrators for clitoral stimulation, but that doesn't mean that they're only for people with vulvas. Vibrators can also be used on nipples. They can be used for massage. Like the Magic Wand started out as a massager. And they're increasingly coming out with more vibrators that can be used with penises or, you know, other body parts. And some don't even vibrate. There's also a lot of suction toys now that fit over the clitoris or nipples and suction.

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 震动器的种类非常多。有大型的**魔力棒**（wand vibrators）；有手掌大小的阴蒂刺激器；还有针对 **G点**或 **P点**设计的内置刺激器。还有双重刺激器，比如经典的“**兔子**”（rabbit）造型，它可以同时提供内部和外部刺激，带来混合高潮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Depending on what you're looking for, there are the big wand vibrators. There are smaller kind of like palmsized vibrators that are specifically clitoral stimulators. And then we have more internalized stimulators. So ones that are designed to be used for anal or vaginal penetration, G-spot or P-spot play. And then there are dual stimulators, which is, you know, the classic rabbit archetype where you have an internal stimulating part and an external stimulator.

</details>

### 如何挑选合适产品

**Rosie Garren**: 对于新手，你有什么推荐吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: For people who have never had the chance of using a vibrator, what are some of the basic things that you should ask if you really don't know where to start?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 我们的平价首选是 **Satisfyer Purple Pleasure**，大约 40 美元，非常小巧便携。另一个小巧的选择是 **Dame Air**，这是一款吸吮式震动器，非常适合伴侣共同使用。还有 **Lelo Dot**，它的尖端非常精准，可以让你针对阴蒂最敏感的部位进行刺激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Our budget pick is the Satisfier Purple Pleasure, which I think is about $40 on the Satisfier site. It's small, easy to like put in a purse. I think the other small picks we have is the Dame Air, which is a suction vibrator, which is also very small and is great for partner play. And then we have the Lelo Dot, which is very unique because it's very pointy. So, it focuses all of the vibration right at the tip at this little pin point.

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 很多人认为新手应该从温和的震动器开始，但这并不绝对。有些人需要非常强大的动力才能达到高潮。如果你发现自己很难达到临界点，可能需要更强劲的产品。我通常会向所有人推荐 **Magic Wand**。虽然它长得有点像医疗设备或麦克风，甚至有点丑，但它非常经典且强力。即使你不喜欢把它当性玩具，它也是一个非常棒的背部按摩器，所以你的钱不会白花。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: There's a sort of idea that if this is your first vibrator, then you don't want it to be as strong because that's scary. But the reality is there are a lot of people who cannot have an orgasm unless the vibrator is very powerful. If you want more power, go for the Magic Wand. And honestly, I do recommend the Magic Wand to everyone. But the thing I always tell people is even if you hate it as a sex toy, it's a really good back massager. So, you're not wasting your money.

</details>

### 严谨的评测流程

**Rosie Garren**: 描述一下你的测试过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Describe your testing process. What is it like?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 首先是研究。我会去大型贸易展，面对面接触设计者，亲手感受产品。我还会去芝加哥当地的性教育商店实地调研。我会建立一个复杂的电子表格，记录保修期、充电时间、电池续航等技术指标。每件产品我至少会亲自测试三到四次，因为身体状态（如**围绝经期**的激素周期）会影响感受。如果我觉得某款产品是“游戏规则改变者”，我们会把它发给第二轮测试者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Initially I do research. I just went to a big trade show and I met all these companies face to face. I also where I am in Chicago live close to Early to Bed. I will just walk in there and I will talk to their sex educators. I have a spreadsheet with the list of the toys. And then I keep track of all the different criteria we're looking at. And then I usually test it on my own at least three or four times because I have a hormonal cycle and I'm parmenopausal at this point too. And at that point, that's when we send it out to secondary testers.

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 我们努力实现测试人群的多样性，涵盖不同年龄段（20 到 50 岁，未来希望加入 60-70 岁的人群）。我们还研究了适合**跨性别女性**、绝经期人群以及残障人士（如握力有限的人）的产品。我们希望在有限的篇幅内让指南尽可能具有包容性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Absolutely. We try to test across the lifespan. I want to get more input about what is criteria for a good sex toy for trans women. I did a lot of research on what are good sex toys for Aphab people who are permenopausal or menopausal. And also disability accessibility. So, you know, maybe people who have limited grip strength. We're trying to make it as inclusive as possible.

</details>

### 警惕仿冒品与材质

**Rosie Garren**: 市场上有很多仿冒品吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Are there knockoff vibrators being sold out there?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 绝对有，尤其是在 Amazon、**Temu** 或 Alibaba 上。你必须非常小心材质。有些产品声称是硅胶，但实际上可能含有**邻苯二甲酸盐**（phthalates）等化学物质，这些材质容易滋生细菌并导致感染。如果价格好得令人难以置信（比如 30 美元的 Magic Wand），那多半是假货。建议投资 100 美元左右购买正品，并关注那些提供 5 到 10 年保修的品牌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Absolutely. Especially when you're using a retailer like Amazon. You can buy sex toys on like Tamu and Alibaba now, too. You do want to be careful especially in terms of like what materials they're using because there's issues with like materials offging chemicals like phalates. Those materials also harbor bacteria and can lead to infections. I would say the main thing to look out for is if the price is too good to be true. If you see something that's claiming to be a Magic Wand, but it's $30 when the product usually retails for $130, that's not going to be the real deal.

</details>

### 维护、清洁与建议

**Rosie Garren**: 如果买了不喜欢怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: What if you buy a vibrator and you just don't like it?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: 不要第一次尝试就放弃。身体需要一个适应过程。你可以尝试添加**润滑剂**，或者在不同的身体部位使用。至于处理，因为含有锂电池，不能直接扔进垃圾桶。我会用漂白剂消毒后送给朋友，但这并不适合所有人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Don't dismiss it on the first try. I think it's important to remember that your body kind of has a learning curve. Try it using it different ways. Add lube. Try it on a different body part. There's not really a lot of good information about how to dispose of them, because a lot of them contain lithium batteries, and so you can't really throw it in the garbage. I will disinfect them with bleach and rehome them with friends.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 最后一个快问快答：给伴侣买礼物有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Question number one, what do you advise if buying for a partner?

</details>

**Bianca Alba**: **一定要沟通**。不要把它当作一个惊喜礼物。最好一起决定，让对方挑选。另外，关于润滑剂：硅胶玩具不要搭配硅胶润滑剂，否则会损坏玩具表面。**水基润滑剂**通常是最安全的选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bianca Alba**: Talk to your partner. Not a good surprise gift. Make that decision together. And what type of lube should you use with a vibrator? Anything that's silicone, there are issues with using silicone toys with silicone lube cuz the molecules can bond and cause the toy to warp. So, I would say that like water-based lube is generally a safe bet.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 谢谢你，Bianca。我们学到了很多，尤其是如果一切都行不通，Magic Wand 还能当背部按摩器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Thank you so much, Bianca. It's been great to chat with you. If all else fails, your Magic Wand can be a back massage, right?
