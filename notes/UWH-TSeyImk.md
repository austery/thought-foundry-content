summary: 弗吉尼亚大学国际政治学教授戴尔·科普兰深入探讨了贸易与战争之间的复杂联系。他提出“动态现实主义”理论，认为国家对未来贸易环境的预期是决定和平或冲突的关键。积极的预期能促进和平，而关税和制裁等负面预期则可能引发战争，如同1941年的日本。该理论被应用于分析当前的中美关系，涵盖了关税争端、技术封锁（稀土、半导体）以及台湾问题，并指出理性的经济考量或许是避免冲突的重要制约因素。

### 对台海冲突的深层忧虑

Joe Weisenthal：您好，欢迎收听新一期的《Odd Lots》播客。我是 Joe Weisenthal。

Tracy Alloway：我是 Tracy Alloway。Tracy，我们最近和 Signum 公司的 Andrew Bishop 做了一期关于地缘政治预测的节目。不知你是否还记得，我们问他的最后一个问题让我有点不寒而栗。你记得吗？

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal. Tracy, we recently did that episode with Andrew Bishop of Signum on sort of geopolitical forecasting, etc. And I don't know if you remember, but the last question we asked him like sort of sent a shiver down my spine a little bit. Do you remember that?</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：他对中国与台湾之间爆发实际冲突的前景相当悲观，这场冲突很可能会卷入包括美国在内的其他世界大国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: He was pretty pessimistic about the outlook for an actual conflict between China and Taiwan, one that would presumably maybe draw in other world powers, including the US.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：是的。我觉得真正让我感到不寒而栗的是，我问他未来五年中国入侵台湾的可能性有多大。让我感到心寒的是他回答“是”的速度，对吧？不是因为他认为这是一个高概率事件，而是因为他毫不犹豫地就认为这是一个高概率事件。我觉得这非常令人不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Yeah. I think what actually really chilled me about that was, I asked him, I said, you know, what are the prospects for some sort of Chinese invasion of Taiwan with the next 5 years? What chilled me was how quickly he answered yes, right? Or it was not the fact that he considered it to be a high probability, is that he considered it to be a high probability without sort of humming and hawing about it. And I found that to be very disturbing.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：这并不让我感到太惊讶。我记得我讲过一个故事，我在大学时写了一篇论文，认为中国会在2008年奥运会前入侵台湾。结果证明是错的。但我认为很多人长期以来一直在预测这件事。这就引出了一个问题：究竟是什么催化剂，能让中华民国和中华人民共和国之间的紧张关系真正演变成武装冲突？然后，我想，这也引出了一个更普遍的问题，即战争是如何发生的，理论上它们是如何形成的，以及贸易战与热战之间的联系。当然，几年前有一本书叫《贸易战是阶级战争》，但贸易战也可能变成……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: That doesn't surprise me that much. I think I told the story about I wrote a dissertation in college about I thought China would invade Taiwan before the 2008 Olympics. So that turned out to be wrong. But I think lots of people have been kind of predicting this for a long time. And it brings up the question of like what exactly is the catalyst for these tensions between the Republic of China and the PRC to actually morph into physical conflict? And then I guess the question of like how wars come about in general, how they come about in theory, the connection between trade wars and hot wars. Of course, there was that book several years ago. Trade wars are class wars, but trade wars can also become...</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：贸易战也是真正的战争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: trade wars are also actual wars.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：贸易战，是的，完全正确。几年前，我们和 Christian Parent 做了一期关于亚历山大·汉密尔顿的节目。他的一个观点是，虽然关于独立战争的流行历史叙事会说，“哦，这是关于税收，或者我们不想为茶叶缴税之类的话题。”但在他看来，这实际上是关于英国限制美国将甘蔗转化为朗姆酒、向价值链上游移动的能力等等。当你想到一些国家限制其他国家在技术价值链上攀升时，就很难不联想到当前美中之间因芯片出口管制和其他类似限制而产生的紧张关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: Trade wars. Yeah. Exactly right. Several years ago, we did an episode with Christian Parent about Alexander Hamilton. And one of his points was that while the popular history of the revolution, the war for independence, people say, "Oh, you know, it's about taxes or we don't want to be taxed on tea or whatever." But that in his argument, it was really about British constraints on the US's inability to turn cane sugar into rum, move up the value chain, etc. And when you think about countries constraining other countries from moving up the technological value chain, once again, hard not to think about the tensions right now between the US and China with chip export controls and other such restrictions.</p>
</details>

### 经济因素在历史中的缺席

Tracy Alloway：总的来说，很多历史叙事似乎确实……有时会忽略很多经济学因素。比如，关于国际贸易及其对外交政策、资本流动的影响，可以写很多东西。我知道你是 Adam Tooze 的《毁灭的代价》的忠实粉丝，那本书基本上……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: In general, it does seem true that a lot of history tends to well, it kind of leaves out a lot of economics sometimes. Like there's so much you could write about international trade and the impact on foreign policy, capital flows. I know you're a big fan of Adam Tooze's Wages of Destruction, which is basically...</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我以前提到过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: I've mentioned that before.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我知道。我敢肯定你会在这次对话中再次提起它，但我真的认为它值得更多关注。它可能没有得到那么多关注，我想是因为……历史学家们可能更喜欢谈论那些激动人心的军事史之类的话题，但它绝对具有现实意义。我想问题在于，它的现实意义有多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: I know. I'm sure you're going to bring it up in this conversation, but I really think it deserves more attention and it probably doesn't get that much attention because I guess historians maybe they like to talk about, you know, sexy military history and things like that, but it definitely has relevance. And I guess the question is how much relevance?</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：完全正确。我很高兴地宣布，我们将进一步探讨这些话题，而且我们请到了最合适的嘉宾。我们将与弗吉尼亚大学国际政治学教授戴尔·科普兰（Dale Copeland）对话。他也是最近出版的《一个更安全的商业世界：从美国革命到中国崛起的美国外交政策》一书的作者。科普兰教授现在加入我们。非常感谢您的到来。

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Totally. Well, I'm really excited to say we're going to explore these topics further and we do have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Dale Copeland, professor of international politics at the University of Virginia. He's also the author of a recent book, A World Safer for Commerce: American Foreign Policy from the Revolution to the Rise of China. So, Professor Copeland joining us now. Thank you so much for coming on.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：很高兴来到这里。

Joe Weisenthal：您能否简要地给我们讲讲，您是如何看待贸易战与热战之间的这种联系的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Great to be here.

Joe Weisenthal: Why don't you just give us the sort of concise version of how you think about this link between trade wars and hot wars?</p>
</details>

### 贸易预期：决定和平与冲突的关键

Dale Copeland：好的。首先我想说，我们低估了贸易对任何体系的地缘政治军事稳定性的影响。我研究了2000年的历史，但在最近两本关于贸易与冲突问题的书中，我发现过去250年里，大国之间至少75%的重大冲突都与贸易和商业的作用直接相关。但有趣的是，我们有两种主流观点。自由主义者认为贸易总能带来和平，因为，嘿，如果美国和中国进行广泛贸易，他们为什么不愿维持和平呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Yes. So, let me start by saying that we underestimate how much impact trade has on the geopolitical military stability of any system. I've explored really 2,000 years of history, but in the last two books both on the question of trade and conflict, I found that at least 75% of the big conflicts between great powers over the last 250 years have been directly related to the role of trade and commerce. But here's what's interesting. We have two big perspectives out there. The liberals believe trade always leads to peace because hey, if US and China are trading extensively, why wouldn't they want to keep the peace going?</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：而现实主义学派则认为恰恰相反，贸易会导致高度依赖和对未来的担忧——担心自己会被切断联系，因此贸易应该会导致冲突。你可以在很多辩论中看到这种分歧，比如米尔斯海默与一些自由主义者的辩论。但我的立场是介于两者之间。它认为，在特定情况下，贸易对和平非常有益。如果各国对未来的贸易环境有积极的预期，他们期望通过贸易获得经济和军事增长，那么他们就希望维持和平。想想1990年以来的中国。它想要和平，想要贸易，并希望通过贸易继续增长。这对中国来说非常棒。然而，历史的另一面是，如果对未来贸易的预期开始下降或变得消极，那么现实主义的逻辑就会开始起作用，国家就会对未来感到悲观。想想1941年的日本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And the realist school believes it's the opposite that trade leads to high dependency and worries about the future. I'm going to be cut off and therefore trade should lead to conflict. And you see this divide in lots of debates. Mearsheimer versus some of the liberals for example. But my position is an intermediate one. And it says under certain circumstances, trade can be very good for peace. If states have positive expectations about the future trade environment, they expect to get the trade that helps them grow economically and militarily, then they want to keep the peace going. Think of China since 1990. It wants the peace. It wants the trade. And it wants to keep growing through that trade. And it's been great for China. The other aspect of this though in history is if expectations of future trade start to fall or become negative then the realist kind of logic kicks in and you have states that become pessimistic about the future. Think of Japan 1941.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：他们决定需要发动战争来保护并获取维持国内基本稳定和经济成功所需的原材料和市场。所以，情况可能朝两个方向发展。这当然意味着外交至关重要。例如，如果美中双方对未来贸易都有积极预期，那么未来二十年它们可以非常和平。但如果关税或经济制裁生效，双方或一方开始认为他们注定无法进入所需的世界市场，那么1941年日本的情景就可能重演，并可能导致中国，例如，染指东南亚。你提到了台湾。或者这可能意味着美国决定需要采取更具侵略性的姿态，以保持从非洲或拉丁美洲获取原材料的渠道。所以你可以看到，这里的基本观点是，根据我的论点，贸易可能走向任何一个方向，我的案例研究几乎总是显示这一点。我可以谈论很多案例，但最近的一本书实际上就是从你提到的美国革命开始的。我会说，我有一个更复杂的观点，但它根植于商业，以及美国人如何感觉自己被英国人压制，无法成长并成为他们可以成为的最强大的力量，他们不得不打一场战争来打破那些经济制裁，或者至少是英国强加的税法中内置的贸易限制。具有讽刺意味的是，我认为思考当今美中关系最好的案例，或者至少是需要避免的案例，是1750年到1776年的案例。在这种情况下，崛起国是中国，而当时是英属北美人；衰落国当时是英国，而现在是美国。这对我们是一个很好的教训，如果我们能避免英国当时所做的——对崛起国实施广泛的贸易限制——我们就能避免一场激烈的冷战，当然也能避免一场真正的热战。所以，我们可以从更宏观的角度来谈论这个问题，但这就是底线。这就是关于贸易如何导致冲突或和平的概述。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: and they decide that they need to go to war to protect and to get access to the raw materials and markets that they need for basic domestic stability and economic success. So it could go each way and what of course that means is that diplomacy matters a lot. US and China, for example, could be very peaceful over the next, you know, two decades if the expectations of future trade are positive on both sides. But if tariffs or economic sanctions kick in and both sides or one side start to believe that they're doomed to not have access to the world markets they need, then the 1941 scenario of Japan might kick in and it might lead to China, for example, going after Southeast Asia. you mentioned Taiwan or it might mean the US decides it needs to be more aggressive to keep access to raw materials from Africa or from Latin America, South America. So you can see that the basic point here is that trade can go either way for my argument and my case studies almost always show this and I can talk about a lot of them but the most recent book in fact starts with the one you mentioned which is the American Revolution and I have a I would say a much more complex view but it's rooted in commerce and how the Americans felt that they were being kept down by the British from growing and becoming the fullest kind of power they could and they had to fight a war to break those economic sanctions or at least the trade restrictions and the restrictions that were built into the tax code that the British imposed. And ironically and I say that the best case for thinking about US China today or at least the one to avoid is the 1750 to 1776 case where in this case the rising state is China and it was back then the British North Americans and the declining state of Britain back then and the US now is a good lesson for us if we avoid what the British did which is the extensive trade restrictions on the rising state we can avoid, you know, an intense cold war and in fact, of course, avoid an actual hot war. So, we can talk about this in a more general sense, but that's the bottom line. That's the overview about how trade leads to conflict or to peace.</p>

### “动态现实主义”框架解析

Tracy Alloway：我一直认为现实主义是一种强调相对收益的思想流派。也就是说，双方可以是贸易伙伴，但如果其中一方获得了巨大优势或增长速度远超另一方，那么就会导致紧张关系。而在新自由主义框架中，一切都关乎绝对收益，对吧？如果每个人都在受益，即使收益不均，大家也都很高兴。所以我很好奇，或许可以帮我们理解一下您的框架，我想您称之为**动态现实主义**（Dynamic Realism: 一种国际关系理论，认为国家对未来贸易环境的预期是决定其采取合作或对抗策略的关键，融合了传统现实主义的权力关切和自由主义对贸易利益的重视）。您能给我们举个例子，详细解释一下它的运作方式，以及它与传统的新自由主义或自由主义对现实主义的解释有何不同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: So, I always thought of realism as a school of thought that emphasizes relative gains. So you know two sides can be trading partners but if one of the trading partners is getting a huge advantage or growing enormously more than the other side then that kind of leads to tensions whereas in the neoliberal framework it's all about absolute gains right if everyone is benefiting even if they're unequal gains then everyone is happy so I'm curious maybe help us understand your framework I think you call it dynamic realism can you give us an example and sort of walk us through exactly how it works and how it differs from traditional interpretations of neoliberalism or just liberalism versus realism.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：当然。Tracy，你捕捉到了一个方面，主要是所谓的**进攻性现实主义**（Offensive Realism: 国际关系理论的一个分支，认为大国总是在寻求最大化其相对权力，并对其他国家的意图持悲观态度）的观点，比如约翰·米尔斯海默等人的观点，即国家在这种观点下总是对未来感到焦虑和担忧。所以他们从不希望一个次等国家通过贸易成长起来，也就是你提到的相对收益。约翰·米尔斯海默35年来一直说不要和中国贸易，它会成长起来，当然中国确实通过贸易成长了，他对此感到非常不安。他是我博士阶段的教授之一。那是一个方面，但我的论点是，聪明的大国实际上会平衡或努力处理外交政策中的权衡。是的，一方面，如果你真的对未来非常执着，你不想让一个希特勒成长起来，例如。所以，在1930年或1933年后与德国贸易是错误的。你想限制那个国家的成长。另一方面，历史上的大多数国家，包括中国，并没有那么坏。他们可能有一些侵略性意图，但不一定会摧毁你。当你面对那种崛起的国家时，你希望在压制对方的愿望和通过贸易利益来约束对方的意愿之间取得平衡。你希望给中国，例如，在1990年代及以后，有能力在增长中保持相对和平，并有动力不去破坏现有体系。我们可以讨论这个问题，但中国是一个相当独特的强国。它需要贸易来实现国内稳定，并且有充分的理由不想接管世界，这是由其国内情况决定的。所以，帮助那个国家成长并建立其力量，不一定是一件好事，但相对于其他选择，即切断它，实际上是两害相权取其轻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Sure. Tracy, you captured one aspect mostly the so-called offensive realist perspective, John Mearsheimer and so forth, which is that states in that view are always anxious and worried about the future. So they don't they never want to let a inferior state grow through trade. that relative gain you talked about and John Mearsheimer for 35 years has said don't trade with China it's going to grow and of course China did grow through trade and he finds that very upsetting he was one of my professors at my PhD level and that's one aspect but my argument is that smart great powers actually balance or try to grapple with the tradeoffs in foreign policy yes on the one hand if you're really obsessed with the future you don't want to let a Hitler grow, for example. So, trading with Germany after 1930 or 1933 was, you know, a wrongheaded thing. You want to constrain that state from growing. On the other hand, most states in history, including China, are not that bad. They may have some aggressive intentions, but they are not necessarily going to destroy you. And when you're faced with that kind of rising state, you want to balance off the desire to keep the other down from the willingness or the desire to, let's just say, constrain that other state through trade benefits. And you want to give China, for example, through the 1990s and after the ability to grow and be relatively peaceful in that growth and have incentives to not go after the system. And China it we can talk about this but China is quite a unique power. It wants trade. It needs trade for domestic stability and it has good reasons not to want to take over the world so to speak because of its domestic situation. So helping that that state grow and build up its power is actually not necessarily a good thing but it's relative to the alternatives namely cutting it off is actually a lesser of two evils.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：这就是我们引入另一种思想流派，我们称之为**防御性现实主义**（Defensive Realism: 国际关系理论的一个分支，认为国家的主要目标是维持自身安全，而非最大化权力，并且在安全得到保障时倾向于维持现状）的地方。在我的新书《一个安全的商业世界》的第二章中，我确实谈到了这一点，关于国家愿意做出权衡，接受相对损失，即让中国通过贸易增长，以换取使整个体系更稳定，并说服对方它确实有积极的贸易预期，因此不必走上战争道路，甚至不必攻击台湾。如果我们想谈到我的底线，那就是关于台湾的问题。在我看来，由于这些经济制约，台湾被攻击的可能性非常小。认识到这一点非常重要，中国知道这一点，并且不想通过做一些可能像接管台湾一样愚蠢的事情来打乱全局，从而引发巨大的经济制裁和全球价值链、全球供应链的中断。那将导致中国不希望出现的衰退局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And that's where we bring in this other school of thought we call defensive realism. And in my chapter two of my new book, A World Safe for Commerce, I do talk about that, about the willingness of states making trade-offs to accept a relative loss, that is letting China grow through trade for the benefit of making the the overall system more stable and to convince the other that it does have positive trade expectations and therefore doesn't have to go on the war path, doesn't have to even go after Taiwan. And this, if we want to get to my bottom line, is the thing about Taiwan is Taiwan will not is very unlikely to be attacked in my view because of these economic constraints. And it's very important to realize that China knows this and doesn't want to upset the apple cart by doing something perhaps as foolish as taking over Taiwan and having huge economic sanctions and disruptions to global value chains and global supply chains kick in and that would cause a declining situation for China that it does not want.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：那么，动态现实主义的论点是，国家基本上可以根据情况在进攻性现实主义和防御性现实主义之间切换，我想这取决于他们对经济、各自增长等的未来预期？如果是这样，您能否给我们举一个实际的历史例子，说明这种情况发生在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: So is the argument for dynamic realism is that basically that countries can kind of shift between offensive versus defensive realism depending on the situation and I guess their future expectations for the economy and respective growth and things like that and if so can you maybe give us an example an actual historical example of like where that happened.</p>
</details>

### 历史的教训：以日本为例

Dale Copeland：当然，我很乐意回到日本的例子，因为人们对此有所了解。在我的第二本书《经济相互依存与战争》中，我通过两三章的篇幅研究了日本从1880年起的增长，以及它卷入的几次冲突，例如1904年与俄国的冲突，当然还有1941年与美国的冲突，但也包括日本经历的长期和平时期，以及为什么日本在相对和平与全面重大冲突之间摇摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: sure I'd love to come back to the Japan one since people do know about it in my second book called economic interdependence and war. I study through two chapters uh three chapters really Japan's growth from 1880 onwards and the number of conflicts it did get into with Russia for example in 1904 and of course with the US in 1941 but also the long periods of peace that Japan had and why was Japan oscillating between relative peace and then allout major conflict.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，这显然与商业及其对未来的期望有很大关系。所以我不会说大国本身在进攻性和防御性现实主义之间摇摆。我实际上尝试做的是将两者融合成一个单一的论点。这意味着国家在每一刻都在不断地权衡，一方面是试图扩大其权力范围、经济权力范围、经济联系，以便通过贸易增长自己的权力基础，即长期权力基础；另一方面是避免引发或推动与另一个国家的不信任和敌对循环，这可能导致双方都不希望的战争。想想日本的案例。日本最初从1880年到1900年，相对温和，非常温和。它与中国打了一场小规模战争，但试图避免与大国发生大战。然而，它在1904年卷入了日俄战争。但这主要是因为俄国在满洲的不良行为，以及它对日本与中国本身进行更广泛贸易的意愿和努力的威胁。所以从文件中可以很清楚地看出，日本在尝试外交手段后，不情愿地卷入了与俄国的战争，这场战争是日本发起的，但它是在外交失败后才不情愿地这样做的。换句话说，它的负面预期使其进入了更具侵略性的模式。我不会称之为进攻性现实主义。我会称之为我的动态现实主义方法，即如果你因为贸易中断或预期贸易中断而相信自己正在衰落，你就会变得具有侵略性，你必须具有侵略性来保护你的长期贸易地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: well it has obviously a lot to do with commerce and its expectations of the future. So I wouldn't say that the great powers are oscillating themselves between offensive and defensive realism. What I actually try to do is blend the two into one single argument. So that what this means is that states are constantly grappling every moment really with this trade-off between trying to expand their power sphere, economic power sphere, their economic connections so they can grow their own power base, their long-term power base through trade and avoiding kicking in or propelling a cycle of mistrust and hostility with another state that might lead to a war that neither side wants. So think of the Japan case. Japan initially from 1880 to really 1900 was relatively moderate, relatively moderate. It had a small war with China but it tried to avoid big wars with big powers and yet it got itself into a Russo-Japanese war in 1904. But that was largely because of Russia's bad behavior, you might say, in Manchuria and its threat to Japan's willingness and effort to trade more extensively with China itself. So it's quite clear from the documents that Japan reluctantly after trying diplomacy got into a war with Russia that it started Japan started the war but it did so only reluctantly after diplomacy had failed. In other words, its negative expectations kicked it into a more aggressive mode. I wouldn't call that offensive realism. I would call it my dynamic realist approach, which says if you believe you're declining because of trade cutoffs or expectations of trade cutoffs, you're going to become aggressive and you have to be aggressive to protect your long-term trade position.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：现在，你猜怎么着？第一次世界大战后，在1920年代，日本非常温和。我们称之为“币原外交”，以当时的外务大臣币原喜重郎命名。但日本与美国合作。它与美国签订了军备控制协议。它与美国的贸易以及与所有大国的贸易都大幅增加。然后，你猜怎么着？1930年到来了，随着大萧条的发生，美国——这具有当代重要性——美国实施了这些非常高的关税。这些被称为1930年的**《斯穆特-霍利关税法》**（Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: 美国在1930年签署的一项贸易保护主义法案，大幅提高了超过2万种进口商品的关税，被认为是加剧全球大萧条的重要因素之一）的高关税彻底摧毁了日本。由于《斯穆特-霍利关税法》，日本在一年半内损失了三分之二的贸易。这改变了一切。即使币原仍在政府中，日本也决定，正如大家所知，入侵满洲并接管中国的一大片地区。军事上控制它。那是1931年9月。然后，至少与中国的关系，事情就从坏变得更糟。到1938-39年，它在满洲边境与苏联交战。这导致美国进一步限制，特别是到1941年对石油的限制。而那些与英国和荷兰协调的石油限制，据我估计，导致日本每年衰退约20%。这导致了珍珠港事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Now, guess what? After World War I in the 1920s, Japan was very moderate. They we call it Shidehara diplomacy after the foreign minister Shidehara. But Japan worked with the US. It had arms controlled agreements with the US. It increased quite extensively its trade with the United States and with all great powers. And guess what? 1930 comes along and with the great depression, the US, this is contemporary importance. US kicks in these very high tariffs. These high tariffs called the Smoot Holly tariffs of 1930 completely devastated Japan. Japan lost 2-thirds of its trade in one and a half years because of the Smoot Holly tariffs. And that changed everything. Japan even with Shidehara still in the government decided to, as everyone knows, invade Manchuria and take over a huge part of China. Take it over and control it militarily. That was September 1931. And then with China at least things just got went from bad to worse. And by 1938-39 it was fighting wars with the Soviet Union on the Manchurian border. And that led the US to further restrictions on oil in particular by 1941. And those oil restrictions that were coordinated with Britain and the Dutch led to Japan declining by my estimation about 20% per year. And that led to Pearl Harbor.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：这里面有很多细节。日本试图通过外交手段重新获得石油。美国几乎达成了协议，然后又切断了那些外交协议，导致了悲观情绪，即对未来贸易的负面预期，这引发了一场我们称之为太平洋战争的大规模战争。但这是一个非常强有力的平行案例。中国人明白这一点，他们明白自己不希望陷入一场关税螺旋，一场以牙还牙的报复，导致我们两国经济的脱钩，这可能使中国开始在相对实力上衰退，并使其转向最终武器，即发动预防性战争以恢复贸易，尤其是在东南亚的贸易，这对日本来说结果并不好，大家都知道。所以中国希望避免这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Now there's a lot of details there. Japan trying to get the oil back through diplomacy. The US almost making agreements and then cutting those diplomatic agreements off and leading to the pessimism, the negative expectations of future trade that led to a massive war we call the Pacific War. But that's a parallel, a very powerful one. And the Chinese understand that they understand that they do not want to get into a tariff spiral. tit for tat, a decoupling of our economies that could make China start to decline in relative power and make it turn to the ultimate weapon which is this preventive war to restore trade especially in Southeast Asia which did not go well for Japan and everyone knows that. So China wants to avoid that.</p>
</details>

### 当代启示：我们是否在重蹈覆辙？

Joe Weisenthal：我不想直接跳到这本书的最后一章。我是说，这本 proverbial 的书。但是，斯穆特-霍利法案，这些各种贸易限制，听起来不妙。听起来如果有人听了您关于避免战争的最佳方式的观点，我们现在的轨迹似乎正朝着完全相反的方向发展。

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: I don't want to like skip to the final chapter of the book here. So, the proverbial book, but Smoot Holly, these various trade restrictions, like it does not sound good. It sounds like if someone was listening to you about what is the optimal way to avoid war, it sounds like we're on the exact opposite trajectory as of right now.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，事情是这样的，Joe，你在某种程度上把这一点融入了你的观点中。如果，至少在我看来，我们理解历史，如果我们也理解好的理论，并采用一种更具动态现实主义的方法，这种方法展示了这些理性行为者在两三种不同形式的现实主义之间进行政策权衡，那么我们就可以避免过去犯下的错误。

<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Well, here's the thing, and Joe, you in some ways embedded this in your point. If we at least in my view, if we understand history, if we understand good theory as well and have a more dynamic realist approach which shows these rational actors making trade-offs in policy between two or three different forms of realism, if you will, then we can avoid the mistakes we made in the past.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我们可以。但我只是说，至少就我们最近看到的政策选择而言，听起来我们并没有做出能降低紧张局势的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: We can. But I'm just saying at least in terms of the policy choices that we've seen lately that does not sound like we are making the choices that reduce the temperature.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：啊，但这正是如此有趣的地方。让我们回到过去。想想四月初，特朗普最初举起他的大牌子时，上面写着对中国征收33%或34%的关税，对其他国家如泰国等征收更高的关税。那个牌子是一个信号，表明特朗普将对所有国家的每一种产品全面征收关税。大多数经济学家，包括我自己（我有经济学背景），都会说这是一个愚蠢的政策。但你猜发生了什么？大约一周之内，他放弃了对所有盟友征收大规模关税的做法。但我认为，因为他至少需要表现出他仍然强硬，他转而对中国征收145%的关税。当然，中国进行了报复。这就是你在谈判中会做的事情。你展示你的决心，你坚持你的立场，你表明你能够伤害对方。一旦中国实施高关税或表现出这种可能性，特别是当它对美国说，我们不会向你们输送稀土和关键矿产，我们不会给你们成为高科技经济体所需的矿产时，你猜发生了什么？5月12日，达成了一项协议。该协议基本上说，“哦，好吧，让我们暂停任何大规模关税，你知道，90天。”然后我们回到了，我想美国是30%，中国是10%。这是一场胜利吗？不完全是。但它显示了什么？它显示了在一个以不具备深厚历史知识而闻名的政府内部，学习曲线非常陡峭。说实话。但在财政部、商务部，我想还有国防部，有足够多的聪明人说，如果我们继续这样下去，我们可能会得到斯穆特-霍利效应。我们可能会重蹈1930年代的覆辙。我们可能会导致两国经济脱钩，从中国的角度来看，彭博社本身一年前也证实了这一点，如果全面脱钩和贸易制裁生效，这可能导致中国经济下滑15%到17%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Ah but this is what's so interesting. Let's just go back in time here. Think of early April and Trump initially if when he held up his big sign had 33% or 34% tariffs on China and much higher tariffs on other states you know Thailand and so forth. And that sign was a sign that Trump was going to go all out with tariffs on everyone, on every product. Most economists, and myself included, I have a background in economics, would say this was a foolish policy. But guess what happened? Within a week or so, he backed away from the massive tariffs on all the allies. But because I think he had to at least show that he was still tough, he went to 145% tariffs on China. And China, of course, retaliated. That's what you do in bargaining. You you show your resolve and you stick to your guns and you show that you can hurt the other. And once China kicked in high tariffs or the prospect of it and especially after it said to the US, we will not send you rare earth and critical minerals. we will not give you the kind of minerals you need to be a high-tech economy. Guess what happened? May 12th, there was an agreement and the agreement basically said, "Oh, well, let's hold off on any big tariffs for, you know, 90 days and we went back down to I think for the US 30% and China 10%." Was it a victory? Not really. But what did it show? It showed that the learning curve was very steep within an administration that is not known for having a huge knowledge of history. Let's be honest. But there were enough smart people in the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, I think in the defense department that said if we keep this up, we could get the Smoot Holly effect. We could get the 1930s all over again. we could get a decoupling of the two economies which from China's point of view and Bloomberg itself a year ago uh kind of confirmed this which from China's point of view could cause a 15 to 17% decline in China's economy should a full decoupling and trade sanctions kick in.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：所以说实话，我并不悲观。我实际上很乐观，认为已经有足够的学习正在进行，以确保我们能够与中国就关税问题达成协议。关税可能不会超高，也许，我不知道，35%左右，但它们不会是我们在1941年看到的那种禁运式的关税。当时甚至不是关税，他们只是说，日本，你将无法从我们美国或我们的盟友那里获得任何石油。正是这一点给日本领导层带来了如此大的困扰。所以你可以再次看到，我在这里有点议程。我的议程是把这段历史公之于众，这样人们就能理解犯了什么错误，为什么国家即使在很大程度上按照我的思路思考也并非完全理性，以及我们现在可以做出什么样的调整来避免一场冷战，更不用说一场热战了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: So I'm not pessimistic to be honest. I'm actually optimistic that there's enough learning already going on to make sure that we will get an agreement, I believe, with China on tariffs. They won't be super high, maybe, I don't know, 35% or something, but they're not going to be the kinds of embargo type of tariffs that we saw in 1941 that they weren't even tariffs. They were just Japan, you will not get any oil from us, the US, or from our allies. And that was what was causing such distress within the Japanese leadership. So you can see again that I have a bit of an agenda here. My agenda is to get this history out there so that people can understand what mistakes were made, why states were not fully rational even if they were thinking largely in my terms and what kinds of adjustments we can make now to avoid even a cold war let alone a hot war.</p>

### 关键商品的战略价值

Tracy Alloway：刚才那个稀土的例子，实际上提醒了我想问的一个问题。在您的分析或框架中，两个或多个相关方之间的贸易是由出口、进口还是资本流动驱动，这有关系吗？比如，人们对外交政策的思考方式，是否会因为贸易紧张的来源不同而存在质的差异？比如，如果紧张来自石油，或者像**稀土**（Rare Earths: 一组对现代技术至关重要的化学元素，广泛用于电子产品、可再生能源和国防工业）这样被人们认为对技术发展至关重要的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: The example of rare earths just then actually reminded me of something I wanted to ask which is in your analysis or your framework, does it matter whether the trade between two respective sides or maybe multiple respective sides is driven by exports or imports or capital flows? Like is there a qualitative difference in how people are thinking about foreign policy depending on where the trade tension is actually coming in? like if it's oil or like if it's rare earths something that people deem crucial to their technological development.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，Tracy，这是一个很好的问题，在国际关系领域内研究得非常不够。我应该提一下我的背景，我最初出生在加拿大，但在加拿大的背景是商业和经济学，在多伦多做了几年金融和市场营销主管，然后我才看到了曙光，转而研究国际关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Well, Tracy is a great question and very much understudied within the field of international relations. I should mention my background I was originally born in Canada but my background up in Canada was in business and economics and I worked as a as a finance and marketing executive in Toronto for a couple of years before I saw the light and studied international relations.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：真是完美的嘉宾。

Dale Copeland：嗯，就是这样。我们也可以谈谈公司政策。但我从我生命中的那段时期，以及从我的知识和对历史的研究中学到的是，具体的产品非常重要。产品的质的特性很重要。我给你们举一个我经常给学生举的例子，就是如果你有一辆车，你可能会说车里的汽油只占车重的1%，价值上可能更少。但没有汽油你就开不了车。所以人们会说，“哦，稀土只占我们进口的1%。”好吧，如果你没有稀土，你就造不出我们现在正在通话的电脑。你至少无法处于技术前沿，然后中国就会在技术上超过你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: truly the perfect guest.

Dale Copeland: Well, there you go. And you know, we can talk corporate policies as well. But what I learned from that time period of my life, but also from my knowledge and study of history, is that specific products matter a lot. The qualitative nature of the product matters. I'm going to give you an example I always give my students, which is if you have a car, you might say that the gas in the car is what 1% of the weight of the car and maybe less than that in terms of its value. But you can't drive the car without gas. And so that people say, "Oh, rare earths are only, you know, 1% of our imports." Well, if you can't have rare earths, you can't build the computers that we're talking through right now. You can't be at least at the technological edge, and China will then overtake you technologically.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：具有讽刺意味的是，中国知道这一点，并利用这一点对美国说，你们想在最高端的科技产品，比如半导体等方面与我们保持平等或领先。好吧，你们需要我们的稀土，我们希望与你们在经济上耦合，因为这意味着我们国内的稳定会很强。所以，让我们一起玩这个游戏，保持我们高水平的贸易。这是中国的立场。如果你愿意，我们稍后可以谈谈中国的国内制约因素。这是我的新书项目。我现在正和我的一个学生写一篇关于稀土的文章。这里的底线是，中国30年来一直有一个非常精心的策略。我们忘了，美国实际上在大约35年前生产了约30%的稀土。现在它几乎不生产了。而中国要么在国内生产所有稀土，要么更重要的是，它与刚果、印度尼西亚和其他地方建立联系，以便它可以在中国境内加工稀土，这使得中国几乎完全垄断了用于计算机和人工智能系统等的大部分稀土。所以，这是一个聪明的策略，因为中国在粮食、能源供应和其他进口方面非常脆弱，但它有一样东西，它知道美国需要并且想要，那就是它的谈判筹码，它使用了它。它在四月份打出了这张王牌，而且奏效了。两周之内，就达成了协议。哦，哇。这是怎么发生的？嗯，中国知道美国高层有足够多的聪明人会对总统说，“总统先生，您希望发展一个非常高科技的经济。您希望把最高水平的制造业带回美国，英特尔等等。”好吧，对不起，先生。没有中国的稀土我们做不到。所以，让我们继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And ironically, China knows this and is using this to say to the US, you want to stay, you know, equal with us or ahead of us in, let's say, the highest of high-tech products like semiconductors and so forth. Well, you're going to need our rare earths and we want to be coupled with you economically because that means our domestic stability at home will be strong. So, let's play this game together and keep our trade levels high. That's the Chinese position. And we can talk about China's domestic constraints later if you want. That's my new book project. And I'm writing an article right now on rare earths with a student of mine. And the bottom line here is that China has for 30 years had a very calculated strategy. America, we forget, actually produced about 30% of rare earth. Oh, about 35 years ago. Now it produces almost none. And China has either it produces all the rare earths at home or more importantly it creates connections with Congo and you know Indonesia and other places so that it can process the rare earths within China that gives China complete almost monopoly control over most of the rare earths that go into computers and AI systems and so forth. So, it's a smart strategy because China is very vulnerable on food, on on energy supplies, on other imports, but it has this one thing that they it knows the US needs and wants, and that's its leverage point for bargaining, and it used it. It played that ace of spades in April, and it worked. Within two weeks, there was a deal. Oh, wow. How did that happen? Well, China knows that the Americans have enough smart people at the top to say to the president, "Mr. President, you want to grow and develop a very high-tech economy. You want to bring manufacturing at the highest level back to the US, Intel, and so forth." Well, I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that without the Chinese rare earths. So, let's keep that going.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：我很快说一下，我们可以谈谈，但中国还有另一个杠杆，当然是中国三十年来一直在购买美国的国库券。中国仍然控制着大约一万亿，略少于一万亿美元的美国国库券。它可以抛售这些，摧毁美元的实力，至少是其相对强势。它不想这样做，因为，嘿，它想保持经济关系的持续。但它可以威胁这样做。那是另一个非常脆弱的点。我们知道，特朗普放弃最初关税的部分原因，正如大家所知，不是因为股市，而是因为在四月的头几周，人们在逃离美元。对美国增长的真正长期影响是毁灭性的，因为我们有巨大的赤字和庞大的债务。我们必须从国外获得更多资金来支付它。如果美元使国库券收益率，即利率上升，那么美国政府将花费巨额资金。所以保持低利率和低国库券收益率对所有这一切至关重要。所以你再次从学习的角度看，我认为美国人已经被泼了冷水，他们说，“是的，这很冷。我们不想走那条路。”那么我悲观什么呢？巴西？好吧，也许是巴西和加拿大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And I'll just say very quickly and we can talk about it, but China also has another lever and that of course is China has been buying Treasury bills from the US for some three decades. And China still controls oh about a trillion, a little less than a trillion dollars worth of US Treasury bills. It could dump those and destroy the dollar's power, at least its its relative strength. And it doesn't want to do that because hey, it wants to keep the economy economic relationship going. But it can threaten that. And that's another very vulnerable point. We know that part of the reason Trump backed away from the initial tariffs, as everyone knows, is not because of the stock market, but it was because people were fleeing from the US dollar in that first weeks of April. And the real long-term implications for US growth were devastating because we have a huge deficit and a large debt. We have to get more money coming in from abroad to pay for it. And if the US dollar makes the Treasury bill yields the interest rate go up, then that costs the American government a huge amount of money. So keeping interest rates low and Treasury bill yields low was vital to all of this. So you can see again from a learning perspective, I think the Americans have already had cold water splashed in their face and they said, "Yeah, it's cold. We don't want to go down that road." So what am I pessimistic about Brazil? Okay, maybe Brazil and Canada.</p>

### 不确定性下的国家决策

Joe Weisenthal：实际上，我很高兴你提到了巴西，因为我想问这个问题。如果这么多问题都取决于预期，是的，现在对于世界其他国家来说，要校准预期似乎非常困难。我想象一下，当特朗普总统宣布将对巴西征收50%的关税，而关税的一个主要原因是对前总统博索纳罗的待遇，这似乎是凭空出现的。这真的是经济问题吗？你知道，在当今美国贸易政策如此不稳定的时期，其他国家如何开始形成预期？政策本身不稳定，而政策的理由似乎也相当不可预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Actually, I'm glad you said Brazil because I was going to ask about this. If so much of these questions hinge on expectations, Yes. It seems like very hard right now, I would imagine, for other countries around the world to calibrate expectations when President Trump announces that there's going to be 50% tariffs on Brazil and that a major reason for the tariffs is the treatment of former President Bolsonaro, which is like, you know, seems like it comes out of nowhere. Is that really an economic thing? You know, how do countries other countries even begin to form expectations at a time when trade policy in the United States is so volatile? The policy itself is volatile and the sort of rationale for the policy is seemingly quite unpredictable.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，这是一个很好的问题，因为它触及了核心：我如何用我的技术语言来操作化“未来贸易预期”这个概念？在政治科学术语中，我如何衡量这一点，以及我如何理解他人如何看待美国或美国如何看待他人？现在，从历史上看，做到这一点的方法之一就是查看文件。如果你把它看作一个从100%到0%的光谱，100%是我确信我们将以100%的确定性继续进行贸易，那太好了。你知道，直到过去6个月，美加关系就是这样。嗯，很好。那是一端的确定性。另一端也有确定性，即我绝对确定你会继续切断我的联系。你正在切断我的联系，我在外交上无能为力来恢复贸易。到1941年11月，日本就是这种情况。我看过文件。日本人尝试了一切办法来恢复贸易，包括提出重大让步的提议。出于一个非常有趣的原因，富兰克林·罗斯福不能这样做。他几乎三次达成协议，但每次都中断了。我给你一个小小的提示，真正的原因是什么。他必须拯救苏联免于德国一端和日本另一端的两线作战。所以通过将日本人引向南方，不是针对珍珠港，他不知道那个，而是将日本人引向南方，他阻止了苏联不得不打一场两线战争，这基本上拯救了世界免于纳粹德国接管欧亚大陆。那是个题外话。我不想深入。那是第二本书。但重要的是，日本领导层在41年4月时有相对中等的预期。哦，你正在切断我们某些种类的石油、天然气和铁矿石。所以，好吧，让我们努力解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Well, it's a great question because it goes to the heart of how do I in my technological language operationalize this idea of expectations of your trade? How in political science terms do I measure this and how do I understand how others see the US or the US sees others? Now, part of the way to do this historically is just look at the documents. If you think of it as a spectrum from 100% I'm assured that we're going to keep trade going with 100% certainty, that's great. You know, that was the US Canada relationship up until last 6 months. Well, great. That's that's certainty at one end. There's also certainty at the other end where I'm absolutely certain you're going to keep cutting me off. You are cutting me off and there's nothing I can do diplomatically to get the trade back. That was Japan by November of 1941. I've looked at the documents. The Japanese tried everything to get the trade back, including offers of major concessions. And for a very interesting reason, FDR, Franklin Roosevelt, could not do that. And he almost made deals three times and he cut them off each time. And I'll give you a quick small hint at what the real reason is. He had to save the Soviet Union from a two-front war between Germany on one end and Japan on the other. So by drawing the Japanese south, not against Pearl Harbor, he didn't know about that, but drawing the Japanese south, he prevented the Soviets from having to fight a two-front war that saved basically the world from Nazi Germany taking over Eurasia. That's a that's a sideline. I don't want to get into it. It's a second book. But what is important here is the Japan leadership had relatively intermediate expectations in April of 41. Oh, you're cutting us off from some kinds of oil and or gas and iron ore. So, well, let's work on that.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：所以我想说的是，如果你把它看作一个光谱，Joe，你就可以计算出别人如何应对你的政策，反之亦然。那么巴西会怎么做？巴西会说，“天哪，这简直是凭空冒出来的。我本来，你知道，有70%的信心我们会达成某种协议。现在事情都泡汤了。”但了解特朗普的行事风格，他会抛出一些东西，然后又收回。你不得不说，你会采取的策略是，“好吧，这事儿五五开。我不知道他会怎么走。可能是50%的关税，也可能他在6周后就收回了。让我们对冲一下。让我们等等看。让我们采取观望政策。”当然，这只是我们都熟悉并喜爱的日常生活中的经典逻辑，即当你不确定事情时，你尽量不要反应过度，但你也不要什么都不做。你试图对冲你的赌注，就像他们说的，你确保你能以最好的方式应对任何一种情况。然后你等待。这就是我们在预期研究中称之为一种中间地带，我无法决定走哪条路。所以为了论证起见，我会说他走哪条路的可能性是50/50。因此，让我们等等看，并通过其他政策进行对冲，比如与其他金砖国家结盟，例如，中国和印度。多元化是一个很好的术语，来自所有领域，尤其是商界。在这种情况下，你通过多元化来规避大的风险，转向风险较低的项目，比如与欧洲人进行贸易，然后你利用这一点作为谈判的筹码。因为毕竟，这里的核心论点不仅仅是传统现实主义者那种由你无法控制的因素导致的确定性战争的观点。你知道，那是米尔斯海默和其他人经常宣扬的传统观点。我的观点要微妙得多，它认为这些因素很重要，但你可以通过自己的政策来控制那些预期，因此你可以利用外交和通过谈判来影响对方的预期，从而避免那些在历史上留下如此多伤疤的冲突。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: So, what I'm saying is if you think of it as a spectrum, Joe, and you can then calculate out how do others deal with your policies and vice versa. So, what does Brazil do? Brazil says, "My gosh, this came out of nowhere. I was, you know, relatively confident, let's say 70% confident we were going to get some kind of deal. Now things are off the table." But knowing what Trump does, which is throw things out and then, you know, retreat from them. You'd have to say what you're going to do is say, "Well, it's 50/50. I don't know where he's going to go with this. It could be 50% tariffs. Could easily be something he pulls away from in another 6 weeks. Let's hedge. Let's wait. Let's do the wait and see policy. And of course, that's just classic logic that we all know and love in our daily lives, which is when you're not kind of certain about things, you try not to overreact, but you also try not to do nothing. You try to hedge your bets, as they say, and you make sure you can deal with either scenario in the best way. And then you wait. And that's what what we would call an expectations research a kind of middle ground where I can't decide one way or the other. So for sake of argument, I'm going to say it's 50/50 that he'll go one way or the other. Therefore, let's wait and see and hedge through other policies aligning with the other bricks. For example, the China and Indias of the world. Diversifying is a great term that from all worlds, especially the business world. In situations like that, you diversify away from the big risk and you go towards lower risk items like trade with you know the Europeans and then you use that as leverage in the bargaining because after all the core thesis here is that it's not just that traditional realist view of deterministic wars that are caused by these things that you can't do anything about. And you know that's the traditional view that Mearsheimer and others often promote. My view is a much more subtle one which says these factors matter but you have control control over those expectations by your own policies and therefore you can use diplomacy and leveraging through bargaining to affect the other's expectations and avoid the kind of conflicts that have so pockmarked history.</p>
</details>

### 技术封锁的利与弊

Tracy Alloway：说到不同的政策，近年来发生的一件事是美国对中国实施的技术限制，我们看到这些限制从第一届特朗普政府延续到拜登政府，现在又延续到第二届政府。有些人会认为，有一种感觉是，也许这些限制导致中国加快了其技术进步，或者当然是感到了一种紧迫感，而这种紧迫感也许它以前没有那么强烈。所以我很好奇，这种对外部商业或贸易限制的恐惧，在多大程度上可以通过国内方式解决，而不是通过向外扩张的侵略性扩张，或者甚至是非侵略性扩张以及与更友好国家的伙伴关系来解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: So speaking of different policies, I mean one of the things that has happened in recent years are the technological limitations imposed on China by the US and we've seen those carried on from the first Trump administration into the Biden administration and now into the second administration as well. And some people would argue that there's a sense that maybe those restrictions have led to China ramping up its technological progress or certainly feeling a sense of urgency that perhaps it didn't feel as much before. And so I'm curious to what extent can this sort of fear of external limitations on commerce or trade, how much of that could be solved domestically instead of through, you know, outward-facing aggressive expansion or maybe even non-aggressive expansion and partnerships with friendlier countries.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：哦，这是一个极好的问题，Tracy。我喜欢你提问的方式，因为它让我可以从历史上谈论那些已经看到或预计会看到某些产品受到限制，因此试图调整的国家。让我们谈谈1930年代的日本和德国。你知道，在战争实际发生前的很多年，双方都在努力在国内合成石油和天然气。他们之所以这样做，是因为他们要么预计，要么已经被切断了某些能源来源，尤其是中东的石油。所以日本没有成功。德国能够利用煤炭和其他东西合成了它在二战期间所需石油和天然气的相当高的比例。在某种程度上相当令人惊讶。但问题是，国家是不情愿地进行这类事情的。而且这样做几乎总是效率低下。你可以想象，你必须再次做出权衡，你放弃了其他可以更有效地建立你力量的事情，因为你不愿意花钱去做你正在谈论的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Oh, that is a fantastic question, Tracy. And I like the way you phrased it because it allows me to talk historically about countries who have seen or expect to see restrictions on certain products and therefore try to adjust. Let's talk about Japan and Germany in the 1930s. You know, many years before the wars actually occurred, both sides were trying to synthesize at home oil and gas. and they were trying to do so because they either expected or were already being cut off from certain kinds of energy sources, especially the Middle East oil. And so Japan did not succeed. Germany was able to use coal and other things to synthesize quite a high percentage of its oil and gas that it needed during World War II. Quite surprising in a way. But here's the thing. States undergo those kinds of things reluctantly. And there's almost always great inefficiencies in doing so. As you can imagine, you have to make trade-offs once again and you trade away from other things that could build your power more efficiently because you are reluctant to spend your money trying to do what you're talking about.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：现在，中国一直在努力建立，我们不要自欺欺人，他们30年来一直在努力建立一个非常强大的技术基础。特别是当习近平上台时，他马上宣布，到2025年，那是他的日期，中国将在半导体生产方面基本实现自给自足。嗯，嘿，我看到的数据是，现在中国仍然需要从国外进口70%到75%的半导体，至少是高端的，而且几乎所有这些都来自，具有讽刺意味的是，台湾，但也来自日本和韩国。当然，英伟达和其他美国公司在这一切中也非常重要，因为它不仅仅是关于生产，还关于这些半导体的设计以及与之配套的人工智能。所以让我们设身处地为中国着想。他们会因为2017年开始的这些限制而像你说的那样加紧步伐吗？当然，他们加紧了，但他们是不是本来就在努力做这件事？是的，那是习近平在2012年宣布的。所以他们已经在努力做这些事情了。那么他们是否因为这些限制而放慢了速度？是的，我认为很明显他们被放慢了。

<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And now China has been trying to build, let's not kid ourselves, they've been trying to build a very strong technological base for 30 years. And especially when Xi Jinping got into power, he announced it right away that by 2025, that was his that was his date. China would be largely self-sufficient in semiconductor production. Well, hey, as the figure I saw that is right now, China still requires 70 to 75% of its semiconductors from abroad, at least the high-tech ones, and almost all of those come from, ironically, Taiwan, but also Japan and South Korea. And of course, Nvidia and other US companies are very important in all of this as well, because it's not just about the production, it's about the design of these semiconductors and the AI that goes with them. So let's just put ourselves in the shoes of China. Would they have ramped it up a bit as you say because of these restrictions that started in 2017? Sure, they ramped it up, but were they trying to do it anyways? Yes, that's what Xi Jinping announced in 2012. So they were already trying to do these kinds of things. So have they been slowed by the restrictions? Yes, I would argue it's quite obvious they have been.</p>

Dale Copeland：替代方案是什么？嗯，替代方案是允许我们所有最高端的科技自由流入中国，并允许台湾、韩国、日本和我们的其他盟友用来自我们的最高端科技生产他们想要的任何东西。顺便说一句，这包括荷兰的机器，即制造台湾芯片的**ASML**（ASML: 总部位于荷兰的光刻机制造商，其设备对于制造先进半导体至关重要）机器。台湾不制造机器，它制造芯片。而那些机器来自一个叫荷兰的小国。那些机器，大约2亿美元一台，被分成四五个部分，用四五架独立的747飞机运到台湾。嗯，那些机器不允许进入中国。不是最高端的那些。较低级别的机器。是的。好的。那些可以进去。所以，中国仍然有问题。它无法非常高效地制造所谓的7纳米以下的芯片。它必须用旧技术进行临时改造，而且它在临时改造方面做得非常出色，并为此付出了效率成本。但这是否意味着中国将能够成为最高科技芯片的高科技生产商，然后出口这些芯片？不。它能做到为自己的华为和中国的苹果iPhone制造提供供应吗？嗯，也许可以，但成本更高。而且最终，那些芯片可能不是最高质量的。每年，中国都知道它正在落后，或者至少让我们说，台湾和其他国家，包括现在的美国和英特尔，仍然处于5纳米以下芯片，现在是4纳米以下芯片的前沿，而这些正是人工智能所必需的。所以我赞成继续限制吗？是的。我是否意识到有办法绕过它？是的。

<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: What is the alternative? Well, the alternative is to allow the free flow of all of our highest of high-tech into China and allow Taiwan and South Korea and Japan and our other allies to allow them to produce whatever they want with the highest of high-tech that comes from us. And this includes, by the way, the Dutch machines, the ASML machines that make the chips in Taiwan. Taiwan doesn't make the machines, it makes the chips. And those machines come from from a little state called the Netherlands. And those machines, $200 million or so, they're broken into four or five parts and shipped on four or five separate 747s to get to Taiwan. Well, those machines are not allowed into China. They're not the highest of high-tech ones. The lower level machines. Yeah. Okay. Those can go in. So, China still has a problem. It can't make the so-called under seven nanometer chips very efficiently. It has to jimmy rig it with old technology and it's done an amazing job of jimmyrigging it and paying the efficiency costs to do so. But does that mean China will be able to be the high-tech producer of the highest tech chips and then export those? No. Can it do it to make it so that it can supply its own Huawei and let's say Apple iPhone manufacturing within China? Uh maybe but at a higher cost. And at the end of the day those chips may not be the highest of high quality. And every year, China knows it's falling behind or at least let's just say Taiwan and the others including now the US and Intel are still at the cutting edge of the under five nanometer chips now under four nanometer chips and those are what are essential to AI. So am I in favor of continued restrictions? Yes. Am I aware that there are ways to get around it? Yes.</p>

### 解读中国的全球雄心

Joe Weisenthal：这有点回到你之前谈到的，你想要与之贸易的国家的类型，以及关于我们应该如何看待中国的雄心存在分歧。我敢肯定有很多书，书的封面是鲜红色的之类的，它们把中国描绘成一个非常具有侵略性、有全球野心的强国，它们谈论所有他们正在建造的人工岛，以及他们在有争议的领土上与海军进行的各种演习等等。另一方面，你知道，就像我几年前读了亨利·基辛格关于中国的书，他描绘的方式是，从其最早的历史来看，中国除了贸易之外，对世界其他地方的事务从来没有太多兴趣。它对那些并不那么兴奋。与苏联不同，它没有一个共产国际试图在其他国家煽动共产主义等等。除了贸易，它并没有特别的扩张主义愿景。跟我们谈谈你的立场。听起来你更倾向于后者，但我们应该如何看待中国自身相对于世界其他地方的雄心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: This sort of goes back to something you were talking about the types of countries that you want to trade with and there are disagreements about how we should perceive China's ambitions. I'm sure there are scores of books out there and the book jacket is like bright red or something like that and they sort of portray China as this like very aggressive power with global ambitions and they talk about all the artificial islands they're building and the various exercises that they're doing with their navy and disputed territories and all kinds of things like that. On the other hand, you know, like I read um Henry Kissinger's book about China a couple years ago, and the way he depicts it is that from its earliest history, China has never had much, I would say, interest in some sense outside of trade, much interest in the goings on of the rest of the world. It's just not that excited about that. Unlike the Soviet Union, it didn't have a comment trying to ferment communism in other countries, etc. that it you know besides trade it it did not have particularly expansionist visions. Talk to us about like where you land. It sounds like you land more on the latter but how we should just think about China's own ambitions visa v the rest of the world.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，在某种程度上，Joe，这是最终的问题，因为我们知道中国可能或可能不会在总GDP上超过美国。是的，这是一个悬而未决的问题。但是，无论中国是否超过美国，或者即使它没有，它是否有野心控制世界更多地区或控制东南亚或军事上主宰非洲。这些是让人们夜不能寐的问题。我的论点，一如既往，是微妙的。我不是鸽派也不是鹰派。我是一个看情况而定的人。这就是情况所在。重要的是要理解我所谓的历史的推动因素和制约因素。推动因素确实是现实主义的。所有崛起的大国，1870年后的德国和日本，1890年后的美国，所有那些崛起的强国都希望扩大我所谓的经济势力范围。他们希望建立海军来保护那些势力范围。他们有一种马汉式的，阿尔弗雷德·塞耶·马汉式的逻辑，即嘿，我们需要更多贸易来增长，但如果我们要保护那份贸易，我们需要一支海军，我们现在就需要建立一支海军。中国已经这样做了，这很经典，这是所有大国都做过的策略，它吓坏了衰落的国家。说实话，英国害怕德国和日本，其他国家害怕苏联建立蓝水海军，但特别是对中国，因为其高贸易量。这非常可怕，因为现在中国是100多个国家的主要经济贸易伙伴，尤其是东南亚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Well in a way Joe this is the ultimate question because we know that China may or may not overtake the US in total GDP. Yeah that's an open air question. But whether China, if it does overtake the US or even if it doesn't, has ambitions to control more of the world or control Southeast Asia or militarily dominate Africa. Those are the kinds of questions that keep people up at night. And my argument, as always, is a nuanced one. I'm not a dove or a hawk. I'm a it depends kind of person. And here's where it depends. What is important is to understand both what I would call the propelling factors of history and the constraining factors. The propelling factors indeed are realist ones. All great powers when they rise, Germany and Japan after 1870, the US after 1890, all those rising powers do want to expand what I call their economic power spheres. They want to build navies to protect those spheres. They have a Mahanian Alfred Thayer Mahan kind of logic that says hey we need more trade to grow but if we're going to protect that trade we need a navy and we need to build a navy now so China has done that and that's just classic that's a strategy that all great powers have done and it scares the declining states let's be honest Britain got scared of Germany and and Japan other states got scared of the Soviet Union when it built a bluewater navy but especially with China because of its high trade trade. This is very scary because now China is the dominant economic trading partner for more than 100 countries, Southeast Asia especially.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：坦率地说，他们已经建立了一支几乎无人能及的海军，尤其是在东南亚地区，并且开始在海军领域挑战美国的全球地位和姿态。这令人担忧。同样令人担忧的是，如果再次戴上更现实主义的帽子，你必须说你永远无法完全了解或确定对方未来的意图。你现在可能喜欢他们，就像杜鲁门在1945年喜欢斯大林一样，但你可能不确定对方在10年或15年后会是什么样子。这是一个经典的、更具进攻性现实主义的立场，即“哦，中国未来的意图不确定。所以，我们现在必须做好准备。我们至少必须假设他们以后会变坏。所以，让我们现在就遏制他们。”这就是让鹰派在夜里兴奋的逻辑。但如果你理解这种更动态、更平衡的现实主义观点，你会说，嘿，遏制是一回事，但通过遏制将对方推向强硬立场是另一回事。你把他们推到了一个他们可能本来不希望处于的位置，即一个具有侵略性或扩张性的强国。所以你必须平衡这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: And let's be straightforward, they have built a navy that's almost second to none, certainly in Southeast Asian area, and is starting to challenge the US for global positioning, posturing, you might say, in the naval realm. That is worrisome. It's very worrisome as well because with a more realist hat on again, you have to say you never quite know or certain about the other's future intentions. You may even like them now as Truman likes Stalin in 1945, but you may be uncertain about what the other will be like in 10 or 15 years time. That's a classic more offensive realist position to say, "Oh, the future intentions of China are uncertain. So, we have to prepare now. we have to at least assume that they're going to be bad later. So, let's contain them now. That's the sort of logic that gets hawks going at night. But if you understand this more dynamic balanced view of realism, you would say, hey, it's one thing to contain, but it's also another thing to push the other through containment into a hardline stance. and you push them into a position they might not otherwise have wanted to be which is namely an aggressive or expansionistic power. So you have to balance that off.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：你如何做到这一点？你如何解读中国现在的意图，尤其是10年或15年后的意图？嗯，你知道，这就是基辛格既对又错的地方。他说的对的是，历史——这是我的新书——中国的历史表明，中国领导人不喜欢把他们的军队派到国外。他们不喜欢接管中国以外的地区，因为每当他们这样做时，他们国内都会出现重大问题。我研究了过去2000年的历史，我至少可以找出五次王朝因为出国或过多卷入海外事务而覆灭的例子。如果你愿意，我们可以谈谈这些。但中国领导人了解他们的历史，他们知道出国会导致国内不稳定，这是一个制约因素。基辛格错在，他忽略了中国对世界姿态中新的、相当不寻常的经济维度。中国，真的，在其大部分历史中，在经济上并没有那么深入地参与世界，至少超出了其近邻。而这正是新的地方。中国现在有38%的GDP与进出口挂钩。这是一个令人难以置信的数字。这是我自1905年以来见过的最高的，而那时是英国。英国的大部分贸易是与殖民地进行的。而中国的贸易是与它不控制的国家进行的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: How do you do this? How do you read the tea leaves of Chinese intentions even now but especially in 10 or 15 years time? Well, you know this is where Kissinger is right but also wrong. He's right that the history this is my new book. The history of China suggests that Chinese leaders do not like going abroad with their troops. They don't like taking over areas outside of China because whenever they've done so, they've had major problems at home. And I've looked at the last uh 2,000 years of history, and I can identify at least five times when dynasties have fallen because they've gone abroad or gotten too involved in overseas issues. We can talk about those if you want. But the Chinese leaders know their history and they know that going abroad can lead to domestic instability and that's a constraint. Where Kissinger's wrong is that he ignores the new and quite unusual economic dimension of China's posturing towards the world. China for really, you know, most of its history has not been that economically involved in the world, at least beyond its immediate neighbors. And this is what's new. China is now has 38% of its GDP tied up in exports and imports. That's an incredible figure. It's the highest I've seen since 1905, and that was Britain. And Britain had most of its trade with colonies. And China's trade is with countries it doesn't control.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：所以这对中国来说是一件非常令人担忧的事情。但它需要这个。它需要这个来发展经济，在技术上保持优势，当然还有维持国内稳定。现在，这才是关键。你猜怎么着？如果中国需要贸易来维持国内稳定，因为它需要发展经济，人民需要感觉到中国共产党的合法性，那么它就必须通过更多的贸易来骑在这只老虎上。如果它要在世界范围内进行更多的贸易，它就需要用军事力量，或者至少是海军力量来保护它。但这也会激发或造成与那些处于顶端的国家之间的误解螺旋。美国相对而言正在衰落，它担心那个崛起的强国。那么我的底线在哪里？如果我们引入基辛格的见解，即中国历史表明中国因为国内担忧而不喜欢出国，但再加上经济维度，即中国必须在经济上走向世界以维持国内和平。那么你就会看到，你或许能够通过确保他们对未来贸易体系有积极的预期来保持中国的和平。如果中国确实相信美国不是在脱钩，拜登在2023年当有这种说法时确保了这一点，他说，“哦，我们在去风险，习先生。我们不是在脱钩。”哦，好。那太好了。特朗普，你知道，在四月份几乎暗示他们将完全脱钩。然后他在五月初又收回了。我认为他不会脱钩。如果你想打赌，我几乎可以赌一百块。这很重要，因为这意味着和平可以通过这种预期机制来维持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: So that's a very concerning thing for China. But it needs that. It needs that to grow the economy, to be technologically superior, and of course to keep domestic stability. Now, that's the that's the kicker. Guess what? If China needs the trade to keep domestic stability because it needs to grow the economy and people need to feel that the Chinese Communist Party is legitimate, well, then it has to keep riding that tiger by having more trade. And if it's going to have more trade around the world, it needs to protect that with military or at least naval power. But that can also excite or create this spiral of misunderstanding with the very states that are on top. The US is declining relatively speaking and it worries about that rising power. So where's my bottom line here? If we bring in the Kissinger insight which Chinese history shows that China doesn't like to go abroad because of domestic concerns but then add in the economic dimension which is China has to go abroad economically to keep the peace at home. Then you see that you might be able to keep China peaceful by ensuring they have positive expectations about the future trading system. If China does believe that the US is not decoupling, and Biden made sure of that in 2023 when there was some talk of it, he said, "Oh, we're de-risking, Mr. Xi Jinping. We're not decoupling." Oh, good. That was great. Trump, you know, almost implied that they were going to fully decouple in April. Then he backed away from that in by early May. I don't think he will decouple. I will almost put a hundred bucks on it if you want to say that. And that's that's important because that means peace can be kept through this mechanism of expectations.</p>

### “一带一路”倡议的战略意图

Tracy Alloway：我还有一个问题，它自然地承接了你之前的一个观点，即关于外国纠葛的危险以及中国的历史，你知道，试图控制和保卫其非常庞大的帝国，并养活其庞大的帝国。但你谈到了**“一带一路”倡议**（Belt and Road Initiative: 由中国提出的全球基础设施发展战略，旨在通过投资和建设连接亚洲、欧洲和非洲的贸易路线来促进经济合作），在国家非常关心未来商业的背景下，与替代盟友或其他国家达成所有这些协议并进行所有这些投资，是很有道理的。但近年来，我们看到中国在某种程度上缩减了其中一些雄心，一些“一带一路”项目。我只是好奇，这个行动如何融入你的框架，以及你会如何解释它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: I just have one more question and it follows on naturally from one of your previous points about I guess the dangers of foreign entanglements and China's history you know trying to control and defend its very very massive empire and also feed its massive empire but you've talked about the belt and road initiative and in the context of countries caring a lot about future commerce you know striking all these deals and making all these investments in alternative allies or other countries makes a lot of sense. But in recent years, we've seen China sort of scale down some of those ambitions, some of the Belt and Road projects. And I'm just curious how that action fits into your framework and how you would interpret that.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：是的，这是一个很好的观点。尽管“缩减”是一个有趣的说法。如果你在向国外输送资金方面的增长率是10%，然后你降到7%，你是在缩减，但你仍然在增长。所以我对“一带一路”的解读是，他们意识到最初的努力对中国来说并不像他们希望的那样成功，很多国家无法偿还他们的贷款。毕竟，大部分是贷款，所以这限制了中国的收益。但“一带一路”仍然是他们更大全球战略中的关键元素，他们的雄心是与世界上几乎每个国家和地区建立经济联系，包括我们的后院南美洲。所以“一带一路”我仍然会说正在强劲发展，但它正在被重新调整和校准，以使其对中国更有效。重要的是要意识到它从何而来。现在，这是我们忘记的事情。我们认为这是2012年习近平宣布的，最初它被称为“一带一路”，你知道，这是一个有趣的想法，他真的去做了，并创建了一个银行系统来支持它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Yeah, it's a good point. And although scaling down is an interesting point. If you're growing at 10% in terms of your sending money abroad and you go to 7% you're scaling back but you're still growing. So the way I read Belt and Road is they realized that the initial efforts were not as successful for China as they wanted them to be and a lot of countries were not able to pay back their loans. After all most of it is loans and so that restricted China's benefits. But the belt and road is still the critical element in their larger global call them ambitions which is to have connections economically with pretty well every country and area of the world including our backyard of South America. So Belden Road is still I would say going strong but it's being retooled and and recalibrated to make it more effective for China. What is important to realize is where that came from. Now here's the thing that we forget. We think of this as 2012 and Xi Jinping announcing the initially it was called one belt one road and you know it was an interesting idea and he really went with it and he created a banking system to support it.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，那实际上可以追溯到1990年代的所谓“走出去”战略。我不记得那个的普通话怎么说了，但“走出去”战略非常相似。它基本上是这样一个想法，即如果我们不开始在国外进行重大投资，并将这些投资与原材料进口联系起来，我们就会开始衰退。我们可能连7%的增长都达不到，更不用说10%的增长了。所以他们看到了我们称之为增长曲线的S曲线的下行部分，他们不希望那种情况发生。所以他们走向了国外。这是一个经典的策略。美国也这样做过。“一带一路”是对此的正式化。有一本关于这个的很好的书，作者是Minure，它追溯到1990年代。为什么？因为这是一个他们需要通过贸易实现增长的策略，而贸易需要我们投资，而不仅仅是形成贸易伙伴。如果我们能发展他们的基础设施，特别是那些需要基础设施来出口原材料的非洲国家或亚洲国家，那么我们就会受益。我们会从中获得巨大的利益。所以，它会继续下去。它会被重新调整。它会非常强大。这对美国来说是一件可怕的事情，美国几乎总是控制着那些全球南方国家的大部分贸易流向。当然，美元在其中扮演了非常重要的角色。所以我预见的是，中国将继续推行这一战略，并用马汉式的海军战略来支持它。美国将继续认为这有些可怕。但只要，至少在南美洲，只要这不伴随着在南美洲加勒比地区的军事设施，就像古巴导弹危机那样，我们可能会让它发生，因为我们不希望敌对的螺旋反噬我们。所以，再次，两个理性的行为者，如果他们是理性的，将会平衡和权衡这种对更多权力和经济联系的渴望，以及他们可能引发导致战争的误解螺旋的恐惧，如果我是对的，他们会处理得很好，或者至少我希望他们会读到它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Well that was really back to the 1990s in this so-called going abroad strategy. I can't remember the Mandarin for that but the the going abroad strategy was very similar. It was basically the idea that if we don't start to create major investments abroad and tie those to uh imports of raw materials, we will start to decline. We might not get even 7% growth, let alone 10% growth. And so they saw what we call the sort of downside of the growth curve, the S-curve, and they didn't want to have that happen. So they went abroad. That's a classic strategy. The US has done it too. And the belt and road was a formalization of this. There's a great book by Minure on this that traces this back to the 1990s. And why why be this is a strategy that they need growth through trade and trade requires us to invest and not just to form trade partners. And if we can develop their infrastructure, especially African countries or Asian countries that need the infrastructure to export the materials, then we will benefit. We will benefit strongly from that. So, it's going to keep going. It's going to be retooled. It's going to be very strong. And it's a scary thing for the US, which is almost always controlled most of those uh global south states in terms of where that trade goes. and the US dollar of course being very much a part of that. So what I foresee is that China will keep that going support it with the Mahanian naval strategy. The US will continue to see that as somewhat scary. But as long as, at least in South America, as long as that doesn't go along with military installments in South America Caribbean like the Cuban missile crisis, we will probably let it happen because we don't want to have the spiral of hostility backfire on us. So again, two rational actors, if they're rational, will balance off and trade off this desire for more power and economic connection with the fear that they might cause a spiral of misunderstanding that leads to war and they'll play it right if I'm correct or at least I hope they'll they'll read it.</p>
</details>

### 习近平时代的延续与变革

Joe Weisenthal：是的。同样希望。我还有最后一个问题。我问过几个不同的人这个问题。你提到了习近平。好的。他推出了“一带一路”项目。他多大程度上是一种延续？在所有后毛泽东时代的领导人中，是否存在一条一贯的红线，或者说他多大程度上是对比如胡锦涛及其前任方向的转向？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Yes. Likewise. I have one last question. I've asked a few different people this. Xi Jinping you mentioned. Okay. He introduced the one belt one road project. How much is he a continuation? How much is there a consistent red strain red ribbon throughout all of the post-Mao leaders versus how much is he a pivot from the direction of you know say Hu Jintao and his predecessors.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：嗯，我认为还必须说，当你在任何现实主义或国际关系学派中处理理解对方意图的问题时，你必须处理三个不同的层面。你必须从个人层面开始，习近平本人是否不同。你必须从国内层面开始，说他是否受到某些其他人没有的国内制约或压力，或者他是否正在处理一个不同的系统环境，即中国在世界上的地位以及它需要完成什么。几乎每个人都倾向于追究习近平的个人方面，说他是个独裁者，他想要更多权力，他想要在历史上留名，他可能会因为渴望在历史上留名而攻击台湾。说实话，我认为普京很像这样。他是由他的个人方面驱动的，而不是出于对地缘政治的理性计算。但如果你去到国内和更系统的层面，我认为你可以看到习近平与邓小平在1990年代初定下的方针非常一致，最初是所谓的“韬光养晦”战略，隐藏你的实力，通过贸易增长你的经济实力，并为长期增长争取时间。当然，那一直是战略，直到习近平。很多人说，“哦，好吧，习近平推翻了邓小平。”不完全是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: well I think one also has to say that when you deal with understanding the other's intentions in any school of realism or international relations you have to deal with three different levels you have to start at the personal level and is Xi Jinping himself different. you have to start at the domestic level and say is he under certain domestic constraints or pressures that the others didn't have or is he dealing with a different systemic environment namely China's place in the world and what it needs to accomplish and there's a tendency of almost everybody to go after Xi Jinping's personal side and say well he's a dictator he wants more power he's you know he wants his place in history he he might attack Taiwan because of his desire for a place in history. To be honest, I think Putin is very much in that realm. He's driven by his personal aspects, not from rational calculations of geopolitics. But if you go to the domestic and the more systemic level, I think you can see Xi Jinping as being very much in line with what Deng Xiaoping laid down in the early 1990s, which initially was a so-called strategy of hide and bide to hide your power and grow your power, grow your economic strengths through trade and bide your time for long-term growth. And that of course was the strategy until Xi Jinping. And a lot of people say, "Oh, well, Xi Jinping threw over Deng Xiaoping." Not really.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：想想2023年。一旦他意识到“战狼外交”和强硬策略正在适得其反，并导致这种误解的螺旋，他就在那上面做出了让步。他从他以传播而闻名的更具侵略性的外交政策中退缩了。嗯，嘿，那仍然在表面之下。他仍然喜欢有点欺负其他国家。是的，那是真的。但中国的长期战略仍然是作为一个崛起的强国成长，并为此目的利用贸易。所以，他比以往任何时候都表现出更多温和领导人的迹象，因为他需要那些贸易联系。他实际上正在利用特朗普的关税混乱来与欧洲、金砖国家、南美洲等地建立更多的贸易联系。所以我怀疑，这与其说是他的个性，不如说是他认识到从长远来看什么对中国是理性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Think about 2023. He then once he was becoming very much aware that wolf warrior diplomacy and hardline tactics were backfiring and causing this spiral of misunderstanding, he made concessions on that. He backed away from the more aggressive, call it, foreign policies that he had come to be known for propagating. Well, hey, that is still there under the surface. He still likes to sort of bully other states. Yeah, that's true. But China's longer strategy is still to grow as a rising power and to use trade for that purpose. And so, he's showing a lot more signs of being a moderate leader than he ever has before because he needs those trade ties. and he's using actually the Trump tariff chaos to create more trade ties with Europe and the bricks and South America and so forth. So I suspect that it's not as much his personality as much as his realization of what is rational for China over the long term.</p>
</details>

Dale Copeland：现在，我最后要说的是，习近平当然在90年代和2000年代的早期是一个较小的官员，但所有中国领导人都明白那个基本点，那就是我们需要长期增长。我们需要贸易来做到这一点，但我们也需要避免因为在世界舞台上过于自信或咄咄逼人而使自己被切断贸易。我们该怎么办？我们平衡。我们有时会制定策略。所以我们，你知道，用一点杠杆，对一个国家施加杠杆，比如在2010年试图告诉日本，我们不接受你们在这些岛屿上的政策，我们要切断你们的稀土供应。所以稀土威胁在2010年首次被提出，而且奏效了，日本和中国仍然进行着非常大量的贸易。那并不意味着中国有了一个新的侵略性战略，那是在习近平之前。它只是把那些当作杠杆。所以最终，我认为习近平非常……我会称他为马基雅维利式的，在这个词的好的一面，即制定战略，理性计算未来，确保他推进，但在受到其他国家反击时又会退缩，并且最重要的是，因为中国的经济以及贸易对它的重要性，确保它建立那些贸易联系，而不是切断中国的贸易联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: Now the final thing I'll say on this regard is Xi Jinping of course was a more minor official through those earlier periods of the 90s and 2000s but all of the Chinese leaders understood that basic point which is that we need to grow over the long term. We need trade to do so but we also need to avoid having ourselves cut off from that trade by being overly assertive or aggressive on the world stage. What do we do? We balance. We sometimes strategize. so that we, you know, use a little bit of a lever, a lever over a state like trying to tell Japan in 2010, we won't accept your policy over these islands and we're going to cut you off from rare earths. So the rare earth threat was first broached in 2010 and it worked and Japan and China still trade very heavily. That didn't mean China had a new aggressive strategy and that was before Xi Jinping. It just used those as levers. So in the end I see Xi Jinping as very uh I would call him Machiavellian in the in the good sense of the word of strategizing rational calculating the future making sure he pushes out but pulls back when he's getting push back from other states and making sure most of all because of China's economy and the importance of trade to it making sure that it builds those trade ties and does not cut China off from those trade ties.</p>
</details>

### 尾声：为何台海冲突短期内不太可能发生

Dale Copeland：这就是为什么，最终，习近平一直在谈论台湾，正如你所暗示的，Tracy，你知道，我们本可以认为中国在20年前就准备好对台湾开战了。嗯，它仍然被推迟了，而且被推迟有一个非常好的理由。那就是彭博社一年前宣布的17%的下降，即如果入侵台湾后经济制裁生效，中国经济的下降。所以，如果你把这一切都带回到你最初关于台湾的观点，我不是乐观也不是悲观。我只是认为，出于理性的战略原因，中共和习近平没有立即想要入侵台湾的理由。他们知道经济上的负面影响是如此巨大，以至于无论他们的其他原因是什么，包括荣耀，如果这意味着摧毁他们40年来为之奋斗的一切，即他们的经济增长，他们是不会这样做的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Dale Copeland: and that is why in the end Xi Jinping keeps talking about Taiwan as you implied Tracy, you know, we could have thought of China being ready for war against Taiwan 20 years ago. Well, it's still being postponed and it's being postponed for a very good reason. That is the 17% decline that Bloomberg pronounced a year ago that the decline in the Chinese economy if economic sanctions kicked in after an invasion of Taiwan. So, if you bring it all the way back to your first points about Taiwan, I'm not optimistic or pessimistic. I just think for rational strategic reasons, the CCP, the Communist Party, and Xi Jinping have no immediate reason for wanting to invade Taiwan. And they know that the downside is so huge economically that whatever their other reasons, Glory included, they are not going to do that if it means destroying everything they've worked for for 40 years, their economic growth.</p>

### 播客主持人结语

Joe Weisenthal：嗯，这让我感觉好了一点，Tracy。

Tracy Alloway：我正要问呢。

Joe Weisenthal：是的。好吧。我是说，我能知道什么呢？我对这个问题没有任何看法，但在听了 Andrew Bishop 对战争前景如此自信的看法后，我吓坏了。我喜欢这样一个想法，即对于某些人看来只是时间问题或不可避免的事情，存在着令人信服的理性反驳论点。

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: Well, that made me feel a little bit better Tracy.

Tracy Alloway: I was about to ask.

Joe Weisenthal: Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, what do I know? I don't have any view on this question, but I was freaked out after how confident Andrew Bishop was about the prospect for war. And I like the idea that there are compelling rational counterarguments for what someone would see as just a matter of time or an inevitability.</p>

Tracy Alloway：你知道，你提到了所有那些封面是红色的书，它们谈论中国的危险和威胁。这很有趣，因为我记得读过一本书，我想它相当有名，但它论证的观点恰恰相反。所以，有点像 Dale 的观点，这个想法是，实际上中国有担心其国内边界等问题的历史，那本书叫《长城与空城计》，它的封面也是红色的。就像两边都是，它们总是红色的。

<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: You know, you mentioned all those books with red covers where they talk about like the danger and the threat of China. It's funny because I remember reading I think it was reasonably wellknown, but there was a book that argued the exact opposite. So, kind of to Dale's point, this idea that like actually China has a history of having to worry about, you know, its domestic borders and things like that, and it was called The Great Wall and the Empty Fortress, and it too had a red cover. It's like both sides, they're always red.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：这太老套了。如果你去……你知道，我有时回家的路上会在 Strand 书店停一下，因为它就在那里。我爱那个地方。是的。然后我，你知道，经常走到中国区。那简直是一堵红墙。就像，出版商们，拜托了。我懂。他们是共产主义者，他们的国旗是红色的，但是拜托，你们得有点创意吧。

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: It's so cliche. If you go to I, you know, I sometimes stop at the Strand bookstore on my way home because it's like right there. I love that place. Yeah. And I, you know, walk to the China section regularly. It's just a wall of red. It's like publishers, come on. I get it. They're communist, their flag is red, but like come on, you got to get a little bit more creative than that.</p>

Tracy Alloway：是的，的确。有一件事我觉得非常有趣，我可能在脑海深处已经知道了，但我猜我没有真正想过，那就是斯穆特-霍利关税法案和日本入侵满洲之间的时间长度基本上是一年。所以，我猜关税是1930年，然后日本在1931年入侵了满洲。这太惊人了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tracy Alloway: Yes, indeed. Um, one thing that I thought was really interesting, and I probably knew this already in the back of my mind, but I guess I hadn't really thought about it, but the length of time between the Smoot Holly tariffs and Japan invading Manchuria was basically a year. So, I guess the tariffs were 1930 and then Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. That's extraordinary.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：不，这个联系……而且，你知道，我整个节目都没提《毁灭的代价》。现在你要提了。嗯，它来了。那里有很多关于德国把煤炭变成合成油的内容。对此有非常详细的讨论，Dale 也提到了。但更重要的是，美国大萧条与所有这些国家经济机会的崩溃之间的联系，以及这如何迫使他们采取这种更具侵略性的姿态。所以重温那段历史，因为你知道，在我的脑海里，当我想到二战时，通常很容易忘记，你知道，1929年的股市崩盘以及美国和西欧等的国内经济危机，是如何直接导致了许多冲突的加剧。

<p class="english-text">Joe Weisenthal: No, the connection to and uh you know I made it through the whole episode without bringing up wages of destruction. Now you're going to do it. Well, and here it comes. There is a lot in there about Germany's turning coal into synthetic oil. A very detailed discussion of that which Dale brought up. But then also just more importantly the link between the Great Depression in the United States and then the collapse of economic opportunities for all these countries and how that forced them into this more aggressive posture so to speak. So revisiting that history because you know in my mind like when I think about World War II typically you know it's sort of easy to forget how like you know the 1929 stock market crash and the sort of domestic economic crisis in the US and Western Europe etc. how directly that led to a lot of the heightened conflict.</p>
