title: 社交媒体审判：成瘾技术与法律挑战
summary: 本期节目探讨了针对社交媒体公司的新一轮诉讼。这些诉讼不再聚焦于平台内容，而是指控其“成瘾性技术”导致用户（尤其是青少年）遭受焦虑、抑郁等身心伤害，并将其比作“数字尼古丁”。此举旨在绕过“第一修正案”的保护，将社交媒体公司置于“个人伤害”的法律框架下。文章分析了诉讼策略、关键证据（如内部文件显示公司知晓产品危害）、公司辩护（如230条款）以及潜在的“大烟草时刻”对行业商业模式的“生存威胁”。

### 社交媒体诉讼潮

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是瑞秋·艾布拉姆斯，欢迎收听《每日播报》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 多年来，社交媒体公司一直依赖于一道难以逾越的“第一修正案”保护，以使其免受关于其产品对儿童有害的法律诉讼。但现在，一群新的原告正采取不同的策略。今天，我的同事西西莉亚·孔将解释这些诉讼为何对社交媒体巨头构成生存威胁，以及这些公司可能如何为自己辩护。今天是1月29日，星期四。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: For years, social media companies have relied on an impenetrable First Amendment protection to shield them from legal claims that their products are dangerous to children. But now, a new cluster of plaintiffs are trying a different tact. Today, my colleague Siccilia Kong explains why these lawsuits pose an existential threat to social media giants and how those companies are likely to defend themselves. It's Thursday, January 29th.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 麻烦缠上了TikTok，因为几个州的州总检察长正在调查这款视频分享平台TikTok是否对儿童有害。Facebook的内部研究发现，其照片分享应用Instagram可能会损害数百万年轻用户的心理健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Trouble for Tik Tok as a group of attorney generals in several states look into whether the video sharing platform Tik Tok is harmful for children. Internal research at Facebook found that its photo sharing app Instagram can harm the mental health of millions of young users.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 研究表明，95%的青少年使用社交媒体。超过三分之一的人表示他们一直在使用。对年轻人来说，TikTok平台就像数字尼古丁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Research shows 95% of teens are on social media. More than a third say they're on constantly. For young people, the Tik Tok platform is like digital nicotine.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 一项图表显示，美国21%的女孩在使用Instagram后感觉“有点糟糕”或“糟糕得多”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: One chart showed 21% of girls in the US felt somewhat worse or much worse after using Instagram.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 社交媒体教会了我很多关于我自己的事情，我以前甚至不知道，比如我的鼻子很难看，或者我的体重不标准。社交媒体说，这些问题的解决方案不是自我接纳。社交媒体说，这些问题的解决方案是产品，有时甚至是手术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Social media taught me things about myself that I didn't even know, like how I had an ugly nose or how my weight wasn't the proper weight. Social media said the solution to these things wasn't self-acceptance. Social media said the solution to these things was products and sometimes even surgeries.

</details>

**旁白**: 未受监管的社交媒体是大规模杀伤性武器，持续危及所有美国青年的安全、隐私和福祉。是时候采取行动了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Unregulated social media is a weapon of mass destruction that continues to jeopardize the safety, privacy, and well-being of all American youth. It's time to act.

</details>

**一位律师/检察官**: 作为三个孩子的父亲，我感到愤怒和震惊。作为一名总检察长，我和我的同事们正在全国范围内采取行动来解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**An Attorney General**: As a dad of three, I'm angered and horrified. As an attorney general, I along with my colleagues across the country are taking action to do something about it.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 西西莉亚，欢迎来到《每日播报》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Cecilia, welcome to the Daily.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 谢谢你邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Thanks for having me.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，西西莉亚，我们在这个节目中已经多次谈论过关于社交媒体对儿童有害的说法，说它会导致心理健康障碍、社交孤立，并且多年来一直有各种尝试来真正遏制这些社交媒体平台的影响力。现在我们有了这批新的诉讼，我想了解一下，这些诉讼与我们之前看到的试图监管或约束这些公司的尝试有何不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So, Cecilia, we've talked a lot on this show about the claims that social media is harmful for children, that it can lead to mental health disorders, social isolation, and there have been all sorts of attempts over the years to really curb the reach and influence of these social media platforms. Now we have this new crop of lawsuits and I want to understand how are these lawsuits any different from previous attempts that we've seen to regulate or reign in these companies.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 多年来，社交媒体公司一直面临着严峻的审查和批评，因为它们过于强大，并且在托管虚假内容方面扼杀了竞争，以及与平台上托管内容相关的各种危害。但本周即将开始的庭审案件则截然不同，因为有数千名个人、学区和州总检察长联合提起了一系列诉讼，他们都在主张同一个观点，那就是社交媒体具有成瘾性，而这些平台的成瘾性已导致了一系列人身伤害，包括焦虑、抑郁、自杀念头和饮食失调。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So these social media companies have for years faced really tough scrutiny and criticism for being too powerful and crushing competition for hosting content that is false. all kinds of harms related to the kind of content that is hosted on these platforms. But the cases that are about to begin this week in trials is really different in that there are thousands of individuals, school districts and state attorneys generals that have come together in a series of lawsuits that are arguing the same one thing, which is that social media is addictive. and that the addictive nature of these platforms have led to a bevy of personal injuries including anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 所以，真正不同的是，这更多地是关于技术的性质，而不是它们托管的内容，这是一个非常新颖的法律理论。这本质上是社交媒体的“大烟草时刻”，正如你所知，这导致了多年来对烟草公司的诉讼，并最终导致了吸烟的减少。因此，许多社交媒体领域的人都认为这是一个真正的生存时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So what's really different is this is less about the content they host and this is more about the nature of the technologies and this is a really novel legal theory. It's essentially social media's big tobacco moment which led as you know to many years of litigation against the tobacco companies and ultimately led to the decline of smoking and so many in social media see this as a really existential moment.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 所以，基本上，这核心是个人伤害索赔，对吗？这有效地允许原告规避了传统上保护这些公司免受责任追究的“言论自由”辩护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So basically the crux of this is that these are personal injury claims, right? And that effectively allows the plaintiffs to sidestep what has traditionally shielded these companies from liability, which is their free speech defense.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 完全正确，瑞秋。这些案件中的律师和原告试图做的就是绕过社交媒体公司一直以来用来保护自己在法庭上免受指控的法律盾牌。他们说：“不，这实际上与言论无关。这是关于你们公司创建和设计了有害的技术，而这些技术违反了州和联邦的消费者法律。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: That's exactly right, Rachel. What the lawyers in these cases and the plaintiffs are trying to do is to get around that legal shield that the social media companies have been able to use to protect themselves in court. and they're saying, "No, this is actually not about speech at all. This is about you companies creating and engineering technologies to be harmful and that those are violations of state and federal consumer laws."

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，我们来梳理一下这些案件。他们具体是如何提出这一主张的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So, let's walk through these cases. How are they making that claim specifically?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 今年，我们将看到两批大型庭审案件开始审理。第一批在洛杉矶进行的庭审涉及九名原告。九起独立的庭审，由这九名不同的原告提起。他们都是个人，都声称在年轻时，还是未成年人时，他们对社交媒体上瘾，并因此遭受了伤害。这九起案件被称为“领头羊”案件，因为它们是从数千起个人对社交媒体公司提起的诉讼中挑选出来的。它们被视为非常具有代表性，能够反映个人因声称对这些社交媒体公司上瘾而经历和遭受的许多不同指控和经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So, this year we will see two big batches of trials begin in all of these cases that have been filed. And the first batch that takes place in Los Angeles include nine plaintiffs. Nine trials, separate trials by these different plaintiffs. They're all individuals all claiming that when they were young, when they were minors, they became addicted to social media and they suffered these harms. And these nine cases, they're known as bellweathers because they've been picked out of thousands of lawsuits filed by individuals against the social media companies. and they're seen as very representative of the many different charges and experiences that individuals have had and suffered as they claim by becoming addicted to these social media companies.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 第一起案件和庭审涉及一位简称KGM的个人。她现在20岁，来自加州奇科。她说她在8岁时创建了第一个社交媒体账户——YouTube。然后她在9岁时加入了Instagram，10岁时加入了Musical.ly（现称为TikTok），11岁时加入了Snapchat。所以，她长期使用所有社交媒体平台。她的母亲说，她完全不知道这些平台可能很危险，并且可能让她的孩子如此上瘾。直到看了新闻节目，了解到社交媒体的潜在危害后，她才意识到这一点。她的母亲说，如果她知道这些网站可能有多危险，她甚至可能不会让女儿拥有手机和使用这些应用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So the first case and trial that begins is of a individual who's goes by the initials KGM. She is a now 20-year-old from Chico, California. And she has said that she created her first social media account on YouTube at the age of 8. She then joined Instagram at the age of 9 and musically, which is now known as Tik Tok at the age of 10 and Snapchat at 11. So, she's been using all the social media platforms for a long time. And her mom said that she had no idea that these platforms could be dangerous and could become so addictive to her child. And she only figured that out after watching a news program where she learned about the potential harms of social media. Her mom said that if she had known how potentially harmful these sites were, she would have prevented her daughter from perhaps even having a phone and using the apps.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: KGM，也就是原告，她认为社交媒体平台对她有着极大的吸引力，让她“上钩”了。这些极具成瘾性的产品使用了诸如“无限滚动”（意味着可以一直滚动下去）和“自动播放视频”（在你还没反应过来时，下一个视频就已经排好队了）等功能。还有算法会为你推荐特定的内容，她发现这些内容非常有毒。所有这些功能导致她过度使用社交媒体并沉迷其中。进而导致了许多心理健康问题，包括焦虑、抑郁、自杀念头和身体形象问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: And what KGM, the plaintiff, is arguing is that the social media platforms were incredibly alluring to her and that she got hooked. And these very addictive products that use features like infinite scrolling, meaning it's just so easy to keep scrolling and scrolling and things like autoplay videos where right after you finish a video, the next one's queued up before you even think about it. and algorithms that direct you and recommend particular content that she has found to be very toxic. That all these features led her to overuse social media and become addicted. And that in turn led to lots of mental health problems including anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and body image issues for her.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这些是我们现在很多人都熟悉的那类指控。即年轻人可能因反复接触社交媒体平台而产生各种心理和情感问题。你还在关注哪些其他诉讼？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So these are the kinds of claims that I think a lot of people have become familiar with by now. The idea that young people can develop any number of mental and emotional conditions from repeated exposure to social media platforms. What is some of the other litigation that you're watching?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 下一波大型诉讼将于六月在联邦法院开始。它们被捆绑在一起，由数十个州的州总检察长以及学区提起。这些诉讼非常有趣，因为它们指控这些公司是“公共妨害物”，学区和各州不得不承担心理健康服务、学校内的辅导项目以及处理青年危机的所有相关费用。因此，他们起诉这些公司要求经济赔偿。他们还表示希望看到公司内部发生重大变革，即平台必须放弃一些成瘾性技术功能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So the next big wave begins around June in federal court. They're all bundled together and they're brought by attorneys general in dozens of states as well as school districts. And those are really interesting, Rachel, in that they are charging the companies with being a public nuisances that the fact that they as school districts and states have had to shoulder the costs of mental health services, phone programs within schools, all kinds of programs to deal with a youth crisis. And so they are suing the companies for monetary damages. And they're also saying that they would like to see big changes within the companies that the platforms have to give up some of these addictive technology features.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 鉴于这些都是个人伤害索赔，原告在法庭上需要证明什么才能胜诉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Given that these are all personal injury claims, what do the plaintiffs actually need to prove in order to prevail in court?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 原告需要证明的是社交媒体与成瘾有关。这将非常困难。这将是一种以前未经检验的新型论点。因此，他们必须出示专家证据，证明使用TikTok和Instagram上的无限滚动以及视频自动播放等工具，这些功能已导致了强迫性使用，并且技术与行为之间存在直接联系。他们还必须证明，这些公司从一开始就知道他们的产品有害，并且他们隐瞒了自己所知的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: What these plaintiffs have to prove is that social media is linked to addiction. And that's going to be hard. It's going to be a new sort of argument that hasn't been tested before. And so they're going to have to show that there is expert evidence that the use of tools like infinite scrolling on Tik Tok and on Instagram and autoplay of video are features that have led to compulsive use and that there is a direct link between the technology and behavior. And they'll also have to show that these companies knew all along that their products were harmful and that they withheld what they knew from the public.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，原告有什么最佳证据来证明你所说的技术与伤害之间的因果关系呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So what's the best evidence that the plaintiffs have to show what you're describing as a causal link between the technology and the harm?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 已经有许多关于社交媒体对心理健康影响的研究。但原告将真正依赖的是他们在审前发现过程中收集到的数十万份文件。原告律师表示，这些文件表明公司知道存在问题，并且他们内部发现了大量关于其产品以及它们如何影响年轻人的令人不安的证据。例如，2018年，Meta开始研究Instagram上的“美颜滤镜”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: So, there have been numerous studies done on the mental health effects of social media. But what the plaintiffs are going to really rely on is hundreds of thousands of documents that they've collected in discovery ahead of these trials that the plaintiff's lawyers say show that the companies knew that there was a problem and they found internally that there was a lot of troubling evidence about their products and how they affected young people. For example, in 2018, Meta began studying how beauty filters on Instagram.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: “美颜滤镜”，说清楚点，就是你可以放在自己脸上或别人脸上的滤镜，让它们看起来更漂亮，就是改变图像，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Beauty filters, just to be clear, those are the filter you can put on your face or somebody else's face to make them more beautiful, to just alter the image, right?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 是的。他们在2018年开始研究，并在2019年因公众强烈反对而决定禁止该滤镜。但同年，即2019年，CEO马克·扎克伯格考虑将滤镜重新引入Instagram。这些是推动用户参与度的重要因素，年轻人喜欢使用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Yes. And they began studying that in 2018 and um decided in 2019 after a lot of backlash publicly that they would ban the filter. But that same year in 2019, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO, considered bringing the filters back to Instagram. These were big drivers of engagement and young people like to use them.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 公司内部的员工恳请他不要这样做，其中包括一位高管，因为她说这些滤镜对年轻女孩来说“毒性太强”了。她说她自己的女儿就患有“身体畸形症”，她直接给扎克伯格发了一封邮件，请求他重新考虑。他忽略了这封邮件，并在2020年决定恢复美颜滤镜。因此，KGM的律师将指出这些内部文件，并表示这是公司不仅研究了问题，还认识到了问题，但却未向公众披露问题，反而允许这些工具继续运行的证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: And employees within the company implored him not to, including an executive, because she said they were really just so toxic for particularly young girls. and she said that her own daughter suffered from body dysmorphia and she sent an email directly to Zuckerberg asking him to reconsider. He ignored the email and decided in 2020 to reinstate the beauty filters. And so lawyers for KGM are going to point to these internal documents and say that this is really the proof that the company not only studied the problem, they recognized there was a problem and yet they did not tell the public about the problem. They allowed the tools to continue operating.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 原告具体要求什么？显然是金钱，但你能否更具体地说明他们的要求？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And what are the plaintiffs asking for specifically? Obviously money, but can you just give us a little bit more specifics on their demands?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 如你所说，原告要求经济赔偿，他们还要求改变这些平台的“设计”。因此，他们将要求更严格的年龄验证和工具，以确保未成年用户不再能够规避服务条款并使用这些平台。他们可能还会要求更多的家长控制功能，并要求公司移除“无限滚动”、“视频自动播放”和“Snapstreaks”（Snapchat连拍）等成瘾性功能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: The plaintiffs are asking, as you said, for monetary damages, and they are also asking for changes to the designs of these platforms. So, they're going to ask for stronger age verification and tools to make sure that underage users are no longer able to escape the terms and service and and use the platforms. They'll probably also ask for more parental controls and that the companies remove addictive features like infinite scroll and autoplay of videos and snap streaks.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 西西莉亚，我真的要暴露年龄了，什么是Snapstreak？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I'm really going to show my age here, Cecilia, but what is a snap streak?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 哦，Snapstreak有点像一个游戏，这也是它被指控具有成瘾性的原因。它是两个人之间的消息传递。目的是在两个人之间建立一个连续的消息记录。你通过每天沟通并发送“snaps”（通常是照片或视频）来维持这个连拍记录。如果你每天都沟通，你的连拍就会继续。如果你停止一天，你就会失去连拍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Oh, so a snap streak is it's kind of a game, and this is why it's been accused of being addictive. It's messaging between two people. And the idea is to create a streak of messages between two people. And you maintain a streak by communicating every day and sending snaps, which are usually visuals, like a photo or some sort of a video or some sort of a message. And you keep your streak going if you communicate every day. You lose your streak if you stop even for one day.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我明白了。这似乎非常明显是一个旨在让你尽可能长时间地停留在平台上的工具，这也是商业模式的一部分，对吧？这些公司就是这样试图对待用户的。所以，如果剥离了这些功能，可能会像你所说的，对整个商业模式构成一种生存威胁，这是合乎逻辑的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I see. And that does seem very clearly like an example of a tool that is designed to keep you on the platform as much as possible, which is part of the business model, right? That's what these companies are trying to do with their users. So it makes sense that if you take those features away, that could pose, as you said, kind of an existential threat to the entire business model.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 是的。而且要记住，商业模式是广告。而真正驱动广告收入的是用户参与度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: That's right. And it's important to keep in mind that the business model is advertising. And what really fuels advertising revenue is engagement,

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: right?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 用户参与度是核心。而这些工具就是为了让人们更投入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Engagement is at the heart of this. And these tools are meant to keep people more engaged.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 所以你可以看出为什么这些庭审对这些公司来说可能如此具有破坏性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So you can see why these trials are really so potentially damaging for these companies.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 因此，我们看到两家公司——Snap和TikTok——在与KGM的第一个案件中达成了和解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: And so that's why we've seen two companies, Snap and [snorts and music] Tik Tok, settle the very first case with KGM.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我们不知道和解的具体条款，但Meta和YouTube仍定于作为KGM诉讼的被告出庭，并且似乎非常决心继续进行审判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: We don't know the terms of those settlements, but Meta and YouTube are still scheduled to go to trial as defendants in KGM's lawsuit and appear very determined to continue to take this to trial.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 西西莉亚，如果这些诉讼对某些社交媒体公司来说可能如此具有生存威胁，为什么其中一些公司不像TikTok和Snap那样与KGM达成和解呢？假设他们为和解支付的金额与不得不改变整个商业模式相比微不足道，对吧？那为什么还要冒险去审判呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Cecilia, if these lawsuits are so existential potentially for some of these social media companies, why would some of them not settle the way that Tik Tok and Snap did with that first case? Presumably the money that they would have to pay to settle is nothing compared with having to alter an entire business model, right? So why even take the risk and go to trial?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 首先，有很多庭审已经安排好了。所以即使两家公司在KGM的第一个案件中达成了和解，在州法院和联邦法院还有无数的后续案件。另一件需要记住的事情是，这些公司，特别是Meta和YouTube，坚信他们有充分的理由，并且他们会提出言论保护。正如你提到的，瑞秋，他们会说有一项法律叫做《通信规范法案》第230条，该法案保护互联网公司免受其托管内容的影响。因为第230条一直非常宽泛，并且在许多不同的情况下都被有力地用于他们的有利地位，所以他们非常有信心能够再次依赖这一法律保护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Well, there are many trials that are scheduled first of all. So even though two companies were able to settle with KGM in this first case, there are numerous more in the state court as well as in federal court going forward. The other thing to keep in mind is that the companies, especially Meta and YouTube, really feel strongly that they have a good case on their side and they will bring up speech protections. Like you mentioned, Rachel, they're going to say that there is a law known as section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that shields internet companies from the content they host. because section 230 has been so broad and so strongly used in their favor in so many different instances and so they're feeling pretty confident that they can rely on that legal shield once again.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 此外，他们拒绝接受社交媒体可能与人身伤害有关的说法，并且公司的律师预计会争辩说，导致心理健康问题的因素有很多。他们会说这是多因素的。可能是学校问题、与朋友的压力，可能有各种各样的因素导致焦虑、抑郁和其他心理健康障碍，而不仅仅是社交媒体本身，对吧？而且，公平地说，因果关系确实是一个值得探讨的问题，对吧？因为我们如何区分社交媒体的影响与宣扬特定美容标准和特定体型的文化的影响呢？是否真的有可能将因果关系隔离并追溯到某个特定的社交媒体平台？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: In addition, they reject the idea that social media can be linked to personal injury and the company's lawyers are expected to argue that there are many factors that go into mental health issues. They're going to say that it's multifactorial. could be school problems, stress with friends, there could be all kinds of factors that lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders and not social media alone, right? And the causal link does in fairness feel like something worth grappling with, right? Because how do you distinguish the impact, for example, of social media from a culture that promotes certain beauty standards and certain body types, right? like is it actually possible to isolate and prove causation back to a specific social media platform?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 原告律师将试图再次利用他们收集到的所有内部文件，并试图展示推动用户参与度、使产品更具粘性甚至成瘾的努力。但最终，在这些加州案件中，将由陪审团来决定。陪审团也将决定后续的案件，这可能对原告有利，因为每个人都有关于社交媒体的故事。例如，我们知道大多数美国父母认为社交媒体是个问题，但这些公司迄今为止却逃避了审查。西西莉亚，如果这最终成为社交媒体的“大烟草时刻”，并且他们在法庭上输掉了这些官司，陪审团认定这确实是一种成瘾性产品，那么这意味着我们有一整代孩子现在都沉迷其中了。所以我想知道，我们整个谈话中一直在谈论社交媒体公司会发生什么，但这些孩子呢？他们实际上是这个大规模社会实验的“小白鼠”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: What the plaintiff's lawyers are going to try to do is to again draw from all the internal documents they've collected and they will try to show how the push to increase engagement and to make their products sticky and even addictive. But ultimately it comes down to a jury in these California cases. Juries will decide the subsequent cases as well and that might be favorable for the plaintiffs because everyone has a story about social media. We know for example that the majority of American parents see social media as a problem and yet the companies have so far escaped scrutiny. Cecilia, if this does end up being social media's big tobacco moment and they lose these cases in court and a jury decides that this is in fact an addictive product, that means that we have an entire generation of kids who are now addicted. And so I wonder, we've been talking this whole conversation a lot about what happens to the social media companies, but what happens to these children that have essentially been the guinea pigs for this massive social experiment?

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 几十年前，当针对大烟草公司的审判开始时，人们觉得指控这些公司制造了成瘾性和有害产品是疯狂且难以置信的。但他们确实做到了。而对于社交媒体，对于所有这些多年来因无法控制社交媒体应用使用而被指责的年轻人来说，这种对话可能会改变。指责的焦点可能会转移到社交媒体公司身上。当然，这无法弥补许多年轻人声称受到社交媒体平台伤害的经历，但它可能会深刻地改变我们社会的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: Remember decades ago when the trials began against big tobacco? It seemed crazy and really far-fetched to accuse the companies of creating an addictive and harmful product. But they did. And with social media, with all of these young people who have been blamed for years for being unable to regulate their use of these social media apps, the conversation might change. the blame could lie in a different place with the social media companies. Now, that won't take back the experiences of so many young people who say they've been harmed by these social media platforms, but it could profoundly change the conversation in our society.

**Rachel Abrams**: 今天还有其他重要新闻。周三，美联储投票决定将利率维持在当前水平，尽管面临特朗普总统要求降息的巨大压力。两位由特朗普总统任命的联储会理事投了反对票。但美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔继续拒绝特朗普的降息要求，甚至在本月政府启动了一项针对鲍威尔行为的异常刑事调查之后。

<details>

**Rachel Abrams**: Here's what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates at their current levels despite enormous pressure from President Trump to cut rates. Two Fed governors, both appointed by President Trump, cast dissenting votes.

**旁白**: 我们的建国者们曾广泛辩论，哪个政府部门应拥有宣战或发起战争的权力。他们几乎一致决定，并写入宪法的是，宣战或发起战争的权力属于国会。

**一位参议员**: 周三，两党参议员，包括来自肯塔基州的共和党人兰德·保罗，在一系列尖锐的质询中，向国务卿马尔科·卢比奥施压，要求他解释为何他或特朗普总统在派遣美军进入委内瑞拉逮捕并驱逐该国总统之前，没有咨询国会。那么我想问你，如果一个外国轰炸了我们的防空导弹，逮捕并驱逐了我们的总统，并封锁了我们的国家，这是否会被视为战争行为？这是否会被视为战争行为？

**A Senator**: Many in a series of pointed exchanges on Wednesday, senators of both parties, including Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky pressed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to explain why neither he nor President Trump consulted with Congress before sending US troops into Venezuela to arrest and remove the country's president.

Would it be an act of war?

**Marco Rubio**: 我们只是不认为这次行动接近宪法定义的战争。

**一位参议员**: 但如果有人对我们这样做，那会是战争行为吗？当然，那将是战争行为。我是在呼吁反战。在听证会上，卢比奥拒绝排除未来美国在委内瑞拉采取军事行动的可能性，但表示特朗普总统无意派美军重返该国。

**A Senator**: But would it be an act of war if someone did it to us? Of course, it would be an act of war. I'm calling anti-war. During the hearing, Rubio refused to rule out future US military action in Venezuela, but said that President Trump has no desire to send American troops back to the country.
