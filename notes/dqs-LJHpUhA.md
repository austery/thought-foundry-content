title: 美国船只袭击是否构成战争罪？对军事行动合法性的深度审视
---
### 美国船只袭击的法律争议

我是《纽约时报》的雷切尔·艾布拉姆斯，这里是《每日》节目。美国军方开始向来自南美的船只开火，至今已有三个月，造成80多人死亡，这促使民主党人紧急质疑这些袭击是否违法。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily. It's been 3 months since the American military began firing on boats from South America, killing more than 80 people and prompting Democrats to raise urgent questions about whether these attacks might be illegal.</p>
</details>

但现在，关于其中一次行动的新问题——军方用第二枚导弹杀死了幸存者——已促使国会共和党人也加入了要求问责的行列。国会对于袭击所谓的“毒品船”一事存在非常严重的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now, we're going to conduct oversight and we're going to try to get to the facts. New questions about one of those operations in which the military killed survivors with a second missile have prompted congressional Republicans to join those calls for accountability. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in.</p>
</details>

我的同事查理·萨维奇将解释这场重新燃起的辩论，以及政府如何为其行动辩护。今天是12月3日星期三。查理，几个月前我们曾邀请你来节目中，谈论特朗普政府在加勒比海对那些他们声称从委内瑞拉向美国运送毒品的船只发动的袭击行动。从一开始，这些袭击的合法性就受到了质疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My colleague Charlie Savage explains the renewed debate and how the administration is justifying its actions. It's Wednesday, December 3rd. Charlie, we had you on the show a couple months ago to talk about the Trump administration's campaign of boat strikes in the Caribbean against boats that they argued were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the United States. And from the beginning, there were questions about the legality of these attacks.</p>
</details>

的确，本周这些质疑因立法者，特别是共和党人宣布计划进行调查而变得更加紧迫。今天我想从《华盛顿邮报》似乎引发这一切的报道开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And those questions took on new urgency this week with lawmakers, notably Republicans, announcing plans to investigate. And that's where I'd like to start today with the Washington Post story that seems to have kicked all of this off.</p>
</details>

### 第一次袭击：幸存者被杀的争议

感恩节后的第二天，《华盛顿邮报》发表了一篇非常出色的报道，详细介绍了特朗普政府早在9月2日进行的第一次船只袭击。在迄今发生的21次袭击中，那次袭击一直是最受质疑的。部分原因是9月份曝光了一些额外的复杂细节，包括船只在被袭击前曾掉头，以及在船只沉没前，遭受的导弹袭击次数比特朗普发布视频中展示的更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the day after Thanksgiving, the Washington Post published a very good story about the first of Trump's boat attacks way back on September 2nd. Now, that had always been the most questionable of the 21 attacks that have happened so far. And part of the reason for that is that there were some additional complicating details that had come to light in September, including that the boat had turned around before it had attacked. That there were more missile strikes on the boat before it sank than just the one that was shown in a video that Trump had put out.</p>
</details>

《拦截者》（The Intercept）曾报道，第一次导弹袭击的最初幸存者在随后的袭击中死亡。但这些都只是粗略的骨架。这篇新闻报道为这次袭击增添了重要而丰富的细节。报道中提到，负责此次行动的**海军上将弗兰克·布拉德利**（Admiral Frank Bradley）下令进行第二次袭击，以杀死第一次袭击的幸存者，因为**国防部长皮特·赫格萨斯**（Pete Hegsath: 一位被提及的国防部长）曾表示要“杀死所有人”。这引发了一场轩然大波，而这种愤怒在9月份这些基本事实首次曝光时并未出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And The Intercept had reported that there were initial survivors of the first missile strike that died in the subsequent strike. But that was all kind of bare bones. This news story added significant and rich detail about this strike. And among the other things it reported was that Admiral Frank Bradley, who was running the operation, had ordered the second strike to kill the survivors of the first one because Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsath had said to kill everyone. And this set off a furor that had not happened back in September when the basic outlines of these facts had first come to light.</p>
</details>

查理，请解释一下，为什么现在会引发这种两党共同的愤怒？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So explain that for a second, Charlie. Why is it that this is now producing this kind of bipartisan outrage?</p>
</details>

要理解这一点，我认为你必须先弄清楚政府对其行为的解释。政府提出了一种法律理论，即这是一场武装冲突，一场特朗普决定我们正在进行的战争，尽管国会并未授权。这是一场与贩毒集团的战争，船上那些据称替贩毒集团走私毒品的人不是罪犯，而是战斗人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to understand that, I think you have to work through the administration's explanation of what it's doing. The administration has put forward a legal theory that this is an armed conflict. This is a war that Trump has decided we're at war, even though Congress has not authorized one. A war with drug cartels and that the people on the boat smuggling these drugs supposedly for the drug cartels are not criminals. They are combatants.</p>
</details>

许多人认为这不是对法律的合法解释，并认为这不是一场武装冲突。但即使你接受这一点，根据武装冲突法，明确规定你不能向那些已经退出战斗的人开火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a lot of people do not think that is a legitimate interpretation of the law and think this is not an armed conflict. But even if you accept it, under the laws of armed conflict very explicitly, you cannot fire upon people who are out of the fight,</p>
</details>

那些已经投降的人、受重伤无法反击的人，或者明确的遇难水手都不能被射击。那是战争罪。因此，根据你刚才概述的情况，9月份的第一次袭击摧毁了船只，杀死了大部分人，但留下了一些幸存者。第二次袭击杀死了剩余的幸存者，这根据战争规则中关于不打击对你没有迫在眉睫威胁的人的规定，似乎表面上就是非法的。这就是为什么《华盛顿邮报》的这篇报道引起了所有人的关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">people who have surrendered, people who are incredibly wounded and unable to fight you back or explicitly shipwrecked sailors cannot be fired upon. That is a war crime. So based on what you just outlined, this first strike in September that destroys the boat, kills most of the people, but leaves a couple of survivors, that second strike that kills the remaining survivors because of the rules of war about not striking people that basically pose no imminent threat to you seems illegal on its face. And that is why this Washington Post story catches everybody's attention.</p>
</details>

### 赫格萨斯的命令与意图

我们到底知道**赫格萨斯**在9月2日的袭击中做了什么或没做什么？我们对他的命令了解多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What exactly do we know though about what Hegsath did or did not do in relation to that September 2nd strike? Like what do we know about the order he gave?</p>
</details>

**赫格萨斯**从一开始就承认他授权对这艘船进行致命打击。这不是一次抓捕行动。他们不是为了破坏引擎然后逮捕船上的人。他们的目标是杀死船上的人，击沉船只，并销毁船上所谓的毒品。这一点没有争议。但问题是，他下达的命令是否考虑到第一次导弹袭击可能无法完成所有这些事情，并且可能存在遇难幸存者。如果发生这种情况，他们是否也应该被杀死？或者命令对此可能性保持沉默？但无论这些命令内容如何，我们被告知，一旦袭击开始，**赫格萨斯**就没有向**布拉德利**下达任何额外指示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Hegsath has acknowledged from the beginning that he authorized a lethal strike on this boat. This was not a capture operation. They weren't aiming to disable the engines and then go arrest the guys. The aim was to kill the people on the boat, sink the boat, destroy the purported drugs on the boat. So that's not in dispute. But the question is whether the orders he gave contemplated that the first missile wouldn't accomplish all those things and that there might be shipwrecked survivors. And if that happened, should they be killed too? Or was the order silent on that possibility? But whatever was in those orders, we have been told that Hegsath gave no additional instructions to Bradley once the attack commenced.</p>
</details>

换句话说，他没有看到或听到有最初的幸存者，然后才说什么。但这是国会需要弄清楚的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words, he didn't see or hear that there were initial survivors and then say something. But this is something Congress needs to figure out. Mhm.</p>
</details>

无论**赫格萨斯**说了什么或意图如何，下一个问题是**布拉德利海军上将**如何理解他的命令？他的意图是我们要杀死那两个人吗？他有没有留下任何同时期的记录，可以解释他是否认为自己是在特意杀死遇难幸存者，还是只是在打击他认为的合法目标？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And regardless of what Hegsath said or intended, the next question is what did Admiral Bradley understand his orders to be? Is his intent we want to kill those two people? Does he say anything that leaves a contemporaneous record that would explain whether he thought he was specifically trying to kill shipwrecked survivors or was just hitting a what he thought was a lawful target?</p>
</details>

再说一次，这开始变得有点深奥，因为如果他的意图是特意杀死这些人，而不是摧毁船只，这有什么区别呢？如果同一枚导弹击中同一目标，无论如何都会造成相同的损害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, this starts to get kind of esoteric because what difference does it make if his intent was to specifically kill these people versus destroy the vessel? if the same missile is hitting the same object causing the same damage regardless.</p>
</details>

这也是为什么试图将武装冲突法应用于这种情况会变得非常不尽人意的原因之一，因为这些规则是为拥有火炮、悬挂旗帜的国家军舰之间的海战而制定的。如果一艘船想投降，它可以降下旗帜并停止开火，然后就退出了战斗。但这艘船不是军舰，而是一艘可能载有非法消费品的快艇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is part of the reason why trying to apply the laws of armed conflict to this situation starts to become very unsatisfactory because these rules are written for naval engagements between warships of nation states that have guns. They're flying colors and if a ship wants to surrender, it can lower its colors and stop firing its guns and then it's out of the fight. But this is not a warship. This is a speedboat that may or may not be carrying an illicit consumer product.</p>
</details>

所以你基本上是说，如果**布拉德利**的意图只是杀死两名幸存者，那么他所做的事情及其合法性在战争法方面会非常明确。但如果他的目标是击沉船只或销毁毒品（这也是**赫格萨斯**最初授权和命令的一部分），那么情况就会变得有点模糊，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically what you're saying is that if the intent here from Bradley was to simply kill the two remaining survivors, it would be really pretty clear-cut what he had done and whether it was legal in terms of the laws of war. But if he was aiming to sink the boat or destroy the drugs, which was also part of the initial mandate and order from Hegse, that's where it gets a bit murkier, right?</p>
</details>

是的，情况会变得更加模糊。当然，即使是最初的命令要合法，这首先必须是一场武装冲突，而除了政府内部，很少有人认为这是一场武装冲突。因此，如果这不是一场武装冲突，那么第一枚导弹是谋杀，第二枚导弹也是谋杀，它们都是非法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's where it gets murkier. Of course, even for that initial order to be lawful, this has to be an armed conflict, which very, very few people outside of the administration think it is. And so, if it's not an armed conflict, the first missile was murder, the second missile was murder, they were all unlawful.</p>
</details>

### 政府的回应与特朗普的立场

到目前为止，政府是如何回应的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How has the administration responded so far?</p>
</details>

整个政府都为这次行动进行了辩护。它强调**赫格萨斯**没有明确命令杀死最初的两名幸存者，并暗示这是一种对所发生事件的误解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The administration as a whole has defended the entire operation. It is stressed that Hegsath did not specifically order the killing of the two initial survivors and has suggested that that is a mis interpretation of what happened.</p>
</details>

尽管如此，它仍然为**布拉德利海军上将**下令进行后续打击的行动辩护，坚称这是合法的。这是整个政府的立场。话虽如此，非常有趣的是，周日晚上，特朗普总统被记者问及此事时，他与第二次打击保持了距离。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nevertheless, it has defended the actions of Admiral Bradley in ordering the follow-up strike, insisting it was lawful, and that's the administration as a whole. That said, very interestingly, on Sunday night, if there were a second strike that killed wounded people in, President Trump was asked about this by reporters and he distanced himself from the second strike,</p>
</details>

他说：“不，我不会希望那样。不是第二次打击。第一次打击非常致命，如果周围有两个人，那没关系。但**皮特**说那没有发生。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal. It was fine if there were two people around. But Pete said that didn't happen.</p>
</details>

这让你觉得有道理吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does that make you sense?</p>
</details>

我非常有信心。他说第一次打击没问题，包括其致命性，但他不希望有第二次打击。为什么不呢？这暗示他对后续打击感到某种不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have great confidence. He said the first one was fine, including the fact that it was lethal, but he wouldn't have wanted the second one. Why not? And the suggestion is he has some kind of discomfort with that follow-up strike.</p>
</details>

### 军事律师的角色与法律顾问办公室的权力

这一切让我好奇，这种事情通常是如何运作的。这些袭击的合法性是问题的关键。所以，我很好奇谁在当时向**布拉德利指挥官**或**皮特·赫格萨斯**这样的人提供法律建议，告诉他们什么是合法的，什么是不合法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This all makes me wonder how this sort of thing would normally work. Like the legality of these strikes in this kind of detail is the thing at issue. And so I'm curious about who is advising the people involved like Commander Bradley or Pete Hegsth about what is legal and what is not in the moment.</p>
</details>

嗯，它应该这样运作：指挥链各级的军事指挥官都应该有参谋**军事检察官**（JAGs: Judge Advocate General officers，负责为军事指挥官提供战争法咨询的军官），他们会就战争法以及什么会越界提供建议。**皮特·赫格萨斯**有一位总法律顾问，并且是受司法部建议的政府的一部分。但我们知道，在7月、8月、9月初，这次行动在筹备阶段，在最初的袭击发生之前，审议过程非常保密。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the way it's supposed to work is the military commanders at each level of the chain are supposed to have staff judge advocate general officers, JAGs, who are advising them about the laws of war and what would cross the line. And Pete Hegsath has a general counsel and is part of an administration that is advised by the Justice Department. But one of the things we know about this operation as it was getting put together in July, August, early September leading up to this initial attack is that the deliberations were very closely held,</p>
</details>

很少有职业军事律师被允许参与讨论。没有很多军装律师、非政治任命的律师被允许参与审议。**皮特·赫格萨斯**在战争中是一名排长，而不是高级指挥官，他似乎对军事律师这个概念产生了敌意。他在回忆录中称他们为“蠢货”（jagoffs）。他似乎将他认为过于限制其部队在看到威胁时开火的交战规则归咎于他们。他似乎误解了，制定这些规则的不是**军事检察官**，而是指挥官。他因此产生了这种敌意。他做的第一件事就是解雇了各军种的最高**军事检察官**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that few career military lawyers were allowed into the room. There weren't a lot of lawyers, uniform lawyers, non-politically appointed lawyers being allowed into the deliberations. Pete Hegsath comes up as a platoon leader in war, not a senior commander, and he seems to have acquired a hostility towards the idea of military lawyers. He talks about them as jagoffs in his memoir. He seems to blame them for rules of engagement that he found to be unduly restrictive about when his troops could open fire on someone they saw as a threat. And he seems to misunderstand that the Jags are not the ones setting those rules, the commanders are. And he acquires from that this hostility. And the first thing he does is he fires the top Jags of the services.</p>
</details>

他一直在试图用国民警卫队成员来取代他们，这些国民警卫队成员更像是来自各州的政治官员，而不是通过**军事检察官**部队晋升的职业现役**军事检察官**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, he's been trying to replace them with not career active duty jags that have come up through the Jag Corps, but with National Guardsmen who are sort of more political officials coming out of states.</p>
</details>

查理，那么**布拉德利**下令进行第二次打击的法律依据会是什么？它会基于什么？在不了解我们一直在讨论的那些仍然模糊的细节的情况下，很难回答。这里听众应该理解的一个问题是，我们现在知道，在这次袭击发生几天后，司法部的**法律顾问办公室**（OLC: Office of Legal Counsel，美国司法部内一个强大的机构，负责为行政部门提供法律意见）——这是行政部门法律体系中一个非常强大的节点——发布或签署了一份备忘录，称其接受特朗普的决定，即这是一场针对这些贩毒集团的武装冲突，所有这些都是合法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Charlie, what would the legal rationale be for Bradley to order that second strike? Like, what would that be based on? It's hard to answer not knowing the details of the sort of questions that we've been talking about that remain fuzzy. And one of the issues here that listeners ought to understand is that we now know that behind the scenes, a couple days after this strike, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is a very powerful node in the Executive Branch legal system, produced or signed a memo that said it accepted Trump's determination that this is an armed conflict against these drug cartels and that all this stuff was lawful.</p>
</details>

所有这些公开辩护的一部分是，贩毒集团是如何攻击我们的？他们没有攻击我们。他们只是在销售一种非法消费品。这很糟糕，但这不是对我们的武装袭击。而修辞上的辩解是，是的，每年有数万美国人死于过量吸毒，这相当于一次袭击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And part of the public justification of all this has been how is it that the cartels are attacking us? They're not attacking us. They're selling an illicit consumer product. That's bad, but it's not an armed attack on us. And the the rhetorical justification has been, yes, but tens of thousands of Americans are dying from overdoses each year, and that's equivalent to an attack.</p>
</details>

所以一旦它被定义为武装冲突，你就可以打击船只了。这份备忘录中有一点与政府一直在公开宣扬的说法不同，那就是船上的毒品，即所谓的货物，是合法的军事目标。为什么？因为贩毒集团可以出售这些毒品，获得利润并将其用于军事装备，以维持他们所谓的对美国的战争努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So once it's an armed conflict, you can hit the boat supposedly. One of the things that this memo says that is different than the public rhetoric the administration has been putting forward is that the drugs, the purported cargo on these boats is a lawful military target. Why? Because the drug cartels could sell those drugs. They could get the profits and spend them on military equipment to sustain their supposed war efforts against the United States.</p>
</details>

因此，围绕美国最初为何向这艘船开火，并持续开火直到所有人死亡，然后船只沉入海底的这种模糊性，部分原因在于后续打击的目标到底是什么？是毒品吗？是船只吗？还是船上的人？或者以某种令人困惑的方式，它们都是目标？因为如果**布拉德利指挥官**进行第二次打击是为了瞄准船上的毒品，而杀死两名幸存者只是附带损害，那么理论上这可以作为司法部所设定的合法行为的辩护，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so part of this murkiness around what is the reason the US fires on this boat in the first instance keeps firing on it until everyone is dead then the boat is at the bottom of the ocean is was the target of those follow-up strikes especially was it the drugs? Was it the boat or was it the people? Was it all of them in some confusing way? Because if Commander Bradley did that second strike in order to target the drugs on the boat and the killing of the two survivors was collateral damage, then theoretically that could be a defense under what the DOJ laid out as kosher, right?</p>
</details>

是的，如果**布拉德利海军上将**这样说，并且有同时期的证据支持他，那么他的立场会强硬得多。但同样，这只有在你首先接受这是一场武装冲突，并且这是看待此事的正确视角时才成立。因为如果不是，他们一开始就没有权利杀人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Admiral Bradley is in a much stronger position if that's what he says and if there's contemporaneous evidence backing him up. Again though, only if you accept in the first place that this is an armed conflict and this is the right lens to be bringing to bear on this at all. Because if it's not, they didn't have a right to kill the people in the first place.</p>
</details>

听起来，杀死最初袭击的幸存者可能是战争罪，如果意图是杀死他们的话，但我们并不知道这一点。事实上，我们不知道的事情太多了，以至于我们无法明确地说它听起来像什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like there are compelling reasons why the killing of the survivors of that initial strike could be a war crime if the intent was to kill them, which we do not know. And in fact, there is so much that we don't know that we cannot say it sounds like anything definitively.</p>
</details>

正因为如此，我想起了几周前那六位民主党议员发布的视频，他们敦促军人无视非法命令。鉴于我们讨论的一切，军人应该如何理解什么是合法的，什么是不合法的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And because of that, I am reminded of the video that those six Democratic lawmakers released a couple weeks ago, which urged service members to ignore illegal orders. Given everything that we've discussed, how are service members supposed to understand what is legal and what is not?</p>
</details>

当你面对一位总司令发布命令，并且这些命令得到司法部备忘录支持，而除了现任行政部门之外，很少有人认为这些备忘录站得住脚时，这是一个极其困难的困境。士兵们应该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is an exceedingly difficult dilemma when you're faced with a commander-in-chief who's issuing orders backed by a Justice Department memo that very few people outside of the current executive branch of government think holds water. What are soldiers supposed to do?</p>
</details>

对吧？为了澄清，当立法者制作那个视频时，他们是否知道这些？他们是否在谈论这些？所以，那些立法者——他们都是军事情报部门的退伍军人——告诉士兵们不应该服从非法命令的视频，其中一个有趣的地方是他们没有说明他们指的是哪些非法命令。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? And just to be clear, when the lawmakers made that video, were they aware of any of this? Were they talking about this? So, one of the interesting things about that video from those lawmakers who are all military intelligence veterans telling soldiers you should not obey illegal orders is they don't say what illegal orders they have in mind.</p>
</details>

所以，特朗普政府的一个抱怨是：你们在说什么？你们是说我们发出了非法命令吗？是哪些？你知道，这可能与特朗普向城市部署军队，其中一些人表现得像警察有关。也可能是这次船只行动。但特朗普政府对那个视频反应非常激烈，称他们为叛乱分子，并对他们展开调查，因为他们竟敢说出这种实际上只是一个法律真理的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the complaints actually by the Trump administration of what are you talking about? Are you saying we've given illegal orders? Which ones? And you know, it could be something about the fact that Trump has been deploying troops into cities and some of them are acting kind of like police officers. It could be this boats operation. But the Trump administration responds very fiercely to that video and calls them insurrectionists and opens investigations of them for daring to say this thing, which is actually just illegal truism.</p>
</details>

我认为这是导致现在国家对围绕特朗普在这些船只上杀人事件的法律争议的关注比9月份更加激烈的原因之一，当时人们还在试图理解这个新事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that I think is a contributing factor to why as the country's attention is returned to legal controversies surrounding Trump's killing of people on these boats. The reaction has been more fierce now than in September when it was still kind of a new thing that people were trying to wrap their heads around.</p>
</details>

### 国会的监督与法律追责的困境

自9月初以来，这种法律阴影一直很明显，而由共和党控制的国会直到现在才对进行多少监督表现出特别的兴趣。因此，随着这项工作在未来几天和几周内展开，我们将看到关注的范围有多广，立法者会提出什么问题，以及他们能够获取什么信息，这将非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This legal cloud has been apparent since early September, and Congress, controlled by the Republican party, has not been particularly interested in performing much oversight until now. And so as this effort unfolds in coming days and weeks, it will be interesting to see how broad the focus is, what questions lawmakers ask, and what information they're able to extract.</p>
</details>

查理，在休息之前，你告诉我们国会要求调查的事情。如果真的发生，那会是什么样子？国会在这里实际拥有什么权力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Charlie, before the break, you told us about these congressional calls for investigation. What might that look like if it happened? And what power does Congress actually have here?</p>
</details>

现在，武装部队委员会的一些共和党人似乎有兴趣获得一些答案，至少是关于第一次袭击中第二次导弹打击的答案。因此，国会正在觉醒。现阶段我们不知道这项监督工作会走多远。它可能非常深入，也可能非常有限。所有这些都将取决于共和党人让特朗普政府感到不适的意愿，正如任何政治观察家所知，这对他们来说并非易事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, now that some Republicans on the Armed Services committees appear to be interested in getting some answers, at least about this second missile strike in this first attack. Congress is therefore awakening. We do not know at this stage how far this oversight effort will go. It could be very searching. It could be very limited. And all of that is going to depend on the appetite of Republicans to make life uncomfortable for the Trump administration, which as any observer of politics knows is not something that is easy for them to do.</p>
</details>

如果他们真的想弄清真相，他们可以要求和争取很多事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If they really want to get to the bottom of this, they have a number of things they can ask for and demand and push the limits to try to get.</p>

他们可以传唤证人并让他们宣誓作证。**赫格萨斯**，显然还有**布拉德利海军上将**。显然，他们还可以要求其他东西。我们知道，政府已经发布了大约30秒的剪辑监控视频，其中没有显示后续打击，也没有显示有人在第一次袭击中幸存，但他们有那个视频。事实上，《纽约时报》已经就那次袭击的未经剪辑的视频提起了诉讼。国会也可以要求提供那个视频。

<p class="english-text">they can call witnesses and have them give sworn testimony. Hegsath, obviously Admiral Bradley, obviously there are things they could ask for as well. the the administration has released, as we know, this sort of 30 second edited surveillance clip that doesn't show the follow-up strikes. It doesn't show people surviving the first attack, but they've, you know, they've got that video. In fact, the New York Times has filed a lawsuit for the unedited video of that strike. Congress also could demand that video.</p>

一位非常资深的退役**军事检察官**告诉我，可以通过实际证据来分析的一个问题是，第二次向船只发射的是哪种导弹，因为它们可以配置成反人员或反物资的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a retired very senior JAG told me that one of the questions that could maybe be parsed through actual evidence is what kind of missile was it that was fired at the boat the second time because they can be configured to be anti-personnel or anti-material.</p>
</details>

反人员导弹可以产生大量弹片以杀死人员，而不是在大型物体上制造一个大洞。那么，他们发射的是哪种导弹？他们是否有其他类型的导弹可用？这些都是如果你真的深入研究这些细节的细微之处——在每个时刻说了什么、做了什么，意图是什么，理解是什么——国会可以要求，然后看看特朗普政府是否愿意交出这些证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">anti-personnel missile can produce a lot of shrapnel to try to kill people as opposed to one that's trying to produce a big hole in a large object. So, which kind did they shoot and did they have the other kind available? These are all the kinds of sort of evidentiary questions that if you're really drilling down into the nuances of these nitty-gritty things of what was said and done at each moment, what was the intent, what was the understanding, Congress could demand and then see if the Trump administration is willing to turn over.</p>
</details>

我只是想了解这些调查能带来什么。假设国会认定军方违法，那接下来会怎样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just want to understand what these investigations could even amount to. So hypothetically, if Congress determines that the military broke the law, what then?</p>
</details>

显然，国会本身是一个政治机构，它履行监督职能，拨款，并通过法律。它不起诉任何人。所以它的职责不是对任何人提出指控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously, Congress itself is a political body and it performs oversight and it appropriates funds and it passes laws. It doesn't prosecute people. So it's not its job to bring charges against anyone.</p>
</details>

当然。如果国会有政治意愿，即在未来的拨款法案中获得多数票，它可以切断对军方进一步船只袭击的资金。它可以拒绝确认特朗普的任命人选，直到政府停止做它认为应该停止的事情。你知道，理论上，它最终可以弹劾特朗普并罢免他的职务，但我们都知道，从政治现实来看，这不太可能发生。即使民主党重新控制了参众两院中的一个或两个，他们也不会拥有参议院定罪所需的三分之二多数票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. It could cut off funds to the military for further boat strikes if it had the political will, meaning majority votes to do that in future appropriations bills. It could refuse to confirm Trump appointees until the administration stops doing this thing it hypothetically thinks it ought to stop doing. You know, ultimately, in theory, it could impeach Trump and remove him from office, but we all know as a matter of political reality that that's unlikely to happen. Even if Democrats retake control of one or both chambers, they won't have the twothirds necessary to convict in the Senate.</p>

### 司法部法律顾问办公室的“免罪金牌”

那么我们刚才谈到的司法部备忘录呢？如果军方违法了，但他们没有超出备忘录授权的范围，那么任何人是否会面临任何后果？你现在问的是，如果有人在这里违法了，无论是整个行动还是仅仅是这次后续导弹袭击，理论上是否有可能有人在未来被指控谋杀或战争罪？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about that DOJ memo that we were talking about, though? Like, if the military broke the law, but they didn't go outside the bounds of what that memo authorized, is anybody vulnerable to any consequences? So, what you're asking about now is if someone broke the law here, whether it's the entire operation or just this follow-up missile strike, is there a place where theoretically someone could be charged, let's say, with murder or war crime down the road?</p>
</details>

嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

答案是，很难看出这会发生在哪里。事实是，现在当这些行动发生时，司法部的官方立场是这是合法的，你不能仅仅因为某人做了你司法部自己当时认为是合法的事情就起诉他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the answer to that is it's very difficult to see where that could happen. The fact is that right now while these actions are happening, the Justice Department's official position is this is lawful and that you can't prosecute someone just for doing anything that you yourself, that is the Justice Department, said was lawful at the time.</p>
</details>

他们依赖你的保证。你不能“诱捕”人们。这是一个正当程序的问题。所以这份**法律顾问办公室**备忘录，这份司法部备忘录，一位曾任**法律顾问办公室**负责人、现在哈佛大学任教的**杰克·戈德史密斯**（Jack Goldsmith）曾将其称为“免罪金牌”（get out of jail free cards）。你可以随意在一张印有**法律顾问办公室**抬头的纸上写下一些废话，然后人们就可以自由地做备忘录上说的任何事情。对此并没有真正的制约。这只是这个系统结构的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're relying on your asurances. You can't bait and switch people. This is a matter of due process. And so this OLC memo, the Justice Department memo, a former head of OLC who teaches at Harvard now named Jack Goldsmith has famously called them get out of jail free cards. Golden shields. You can just write down some nonsense on a piece of paper on OLC letterhead and suddenly people are free to do whatever that memo says. And there's just not really a check on that. It's a it's just the way the structure the system is structured.</p>
</details>

我想在这里暂停一下，因为你说的有点惊人。我的意思是，你不能写一份合同，让两方签署一份违法合同，然后说“好吧，我们有合同”。你是在说，如果司法部写了一份备忘录，说某事是合法的，那么它就保护了在备忘录范围内执行命令的任何人，即使根据任何其他分析，这些行为被认定为非法。仅仅是这份备忘录的存在，听起来就能保护人们免受起诉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just want to pause here because what you're saying is kind of remarkable. I mean, you cannot write a contract, for instance, and have two parties sign it that breaks the law and say, "Well, we have a contract." What you are saying is that if the DOJ writes a memo and says that something is lawful, that protects anybody carrying out orders within the bounds of that memo, even if by any other analysis, those actions are determined to be illegal. Just the fact that that memo exists, it sounds like, protects people from prosecution,</p>
</details>

是的，免受国内联邦起诉。没错。这就是司法部内部**法律顾问办公室**的权力。我们在20年前也看到过类似的情况，9/11事件后，布什政府的**法律顾问办公室**里有一位名叫**约翰·余**（John Yu）的律师，他对行政权力持有异乎寻常的宽泛看法，大多数人认为这是错误的。在他的观点下，总统可以授权任何他认为保护国家安全所必需的事情，比如未经授权的窃听、对囚犯施加**水刑**（waterboarding: 一种模拟溺水感的酷刑）。这些备忘录后来被撤销了，但在这些事情发生时它们是存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">domestic, federal prosecution. That's right. This is this is the power of the office of legal counsel within the Justice Department. And we saw an earlier round of this 20 years ago when after 9/11, the Bush administration had in its office of legal counsel a lawyer named John Yu who had a idiosyncratically broad view of executive power that most people thought was wrong. And under his view, the president could authorize anything he thought was necessary to protect national security. things like wiretapping without warrants, torturing prisoners. These memos are later rescended, but they were there while this stuff was happening.</p>
</details>

当**巴拉克·奥巴马**（Barack Obama）手下的自由派司法部长**埃里克·霍尔德**（Eric Holder）在2009年上任并对布什政府时期中情局对待被拘留者的方式展开刑事调查时，由于**法律顾问办公室**当时的保证问题，他说：“我们只会调查超出**法律顾问办公室**认可指导范围的行动。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when Eric Holder, the liberal attorney general under Barack Obama, comes in in 2009 and opens a criminal investigation into the treatment of detainees by the CIA under the Bush administration. Because of this problem of the OLC's asurances at the time, he says, "We are only going to look at actions that went beyond the guidance that was blessed by the OLC."</p>
</details>

所以**法律顾问办公室**说你可以对人们施加**水刑**，而你也这样做了。即使其他人说淹死人是酷刑且非法，**法律顾问办公室**说没问题。我们不会因此起诉你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the OLC said you can waterboard people and you waterboarded people. Even if everyone else says drowning people is torture and it's illegal, OLC said it was okay. We're not going to prosecute you for that.</p>
</details>

嗯。当然，这里的问题是，这也是我们回到关于第二次打击的讨论的地方，备忘录显然说，因为这被认为是武装冲突，所以符合战争法、武装冲突法的打击是允许的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. Now, the catch, of course, and this is where we circle back to this conversation about this second strike is the memo says apparently because this is supposedly an armed conflict, strikes that comport with the law of war, the law of armed conflict are permissible.</p>
</details>

对吧？第一次袭击中杀死遇难幸存者的第二次导弹打击，可以说不符合武装冲突法。因此，这就是这次特定打击与其他所有打击相比，可能更容易受到后期法律审查的地方，特别是如果有证据表明**布拉德利海军上将**的具体意图是瞄准仍然活着的船员，而不是船只或所谓的货物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? the second missile strike in the first attack which kills the shipwrecked survivors of the first missile strike arguably does not comport with the law of armed conflict. And so that's one place where this particular strike as opposed to all the others might be more vulnerable to later legal scrutiny because especially if there's evidence that Admiral Bradley's specific intent was to target the still living crew members as opposed to the boat or the supposed cargo.</p>
</details>

那是一个点，尽管有**法律顾问办公室**的备忘录，你仍然可以看到后来的检察官（我想这会在军事法庭系统）如果有政治意愿的话，会对此进行严格审查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a point where despite the OLC memo, you could see a later prosecutor, I guess this would be in the court marshall system, were there the political will to do so, taking a hard look at that,</p>
</details>

对吧？基本上，如果意图是杀死第一次袭击的幸存者，那么它可以说超出了备忘录的范围，也超出了被认为是合法战争的范围。因此，发起那次袭击的人员可能面临起诉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Basically, if the attempt was to kill the survivors of that first strike, it arguably would be outside the bounds of that memo and outside the bounds of what is considered legal warfare. So therefore, the people who launched that strike potentially could be prosecuted.</p>
</details>

如果未来没有全面的赦免，他们可能会面临起诉。当然，还有国际法。荷兰海牙有一个法院，叫做**国际刑事法院**（International Criminal Court: 位于荷兰海牙，负责审判战争罪、危害人类罪和种族灭绝罪的常设法院）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">potentially down the road if there's no sweeping preemptive pardon. Now, of course, there's also international law. There is a court in the Hague in the Netherlands called the International Criminal Court,</p>
</details>

它作为一个常设法院，负责起诉战争罪、危害人类罪、种族灭绝罪。我应该指出，我们不是**国际刑事法院**的缔约国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it exists as a standing court to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide. And I should note that we are not a party to the International Criminal Court.</p>
</details>

我们不是缔约国。委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚等国是缔约国。因此，在某些情况下，理论上美国官员可能会因在委内瑞拉境内对委内瑞拉人采取的行动而在海牙受到起诉。同样，现在海牙的法院对**弗拉基米尔·普京**（Vladimir Putin）发出了逮捕令，尽管俄罗斯不是创建该法院条约的成员国，因为乌克兰是成员国，所以**普京**因其在乌克兰的行动而受到指控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are not a party. The countries of Venezuela and Colombia among others are parties. And so there are circumstances in which in theory American officials could be prosecuted in the HEG for actions, let's say, inside Venezuela against Venezuelans. In the same way, right now the court in the HEG has an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin even though Russia is not a member of the treaty that creates the court for his actions in Ukraine because Ukraine is a member.</p>
</details>

嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

但这些船只袭击目前至少都发生在国际水域。据我们所知或在视频中看到的，这些船只没有悬挂任何国家的旗帜。它们没有在委内瑞拉或哥伦比亚注册。它们只是小船，不是军舰。因此，由于没有在任何国家注册，也不在任何国家的领土内，**国际刑事法院**对这些袭击没有管辖权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But these boats attacks are for now at least all in international waters. And these boats are not flying as far as we know or have seen on the videos any country's flag. They're not registered to Venezuela or Colombia. They're just little boats. They're not ships. And so without being registered to a country, without being in the country's territory, there's no jurisdiction for the International Criminal Court over these attacks.</p>
</details>

所以目前没有什么，除非这次行动蔓延到委内瑞拉，这有可能，但就目前而言，这些袭击，包括9月2日的袭击，都不会提交给**国际刑事法院**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing for now, unless this operation spreads to Venezuela, as it might, but for now, nothing on these attacks, including the September 2 attack, would come before the International Criminal Court.</p>

### 狭隘关注与更广泛的争议

查理，我们今天的对话是由我们讨论的对第一次船只袭击中第二次打击的更多审查所引发的，以及这是否违反了武装冲突规则。但我们的对话并非由整个船只袭击行动是否非法的问题所引发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Charlie, our conversation today was prompted by, as we discussed, more scrutiny about the second strike on that first boat and whether that violates the rules of armed conflict. But our conversation was not prompted by the question of whether the entire operation to fire on these boats is illegal.</p>
</details>

对吧？作为一名一直关注这个故事的每一个转折的国家安全专家，你对这种非常具体地关注第二次打击有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And I am curious as somebody who has been following every turn of the story and is a national security expert, what do you think about this focus very specifically on the second strike?</p>
</details>

一方面，人们关注此事是好事。我们看到国会监督委员会正在采取行动，提出尖锐的问题。我们将拭目以待他们对获取答案的承诺能持续多久，但这看起来有点像国会监督应该发挥作用的方式。人们对一些客观上非常重要的事情感兴趣。另一方面，一旦你真正深入研究，关于谁说了什么、何时说、出于何种意图以及对第二次打击的解释等问题都非常狭隘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on the one hand, it is good that people are paying attention. We're seeing congressional oversight committees swinging into action, asking hard questions. We'll see how committed they remain to, you know, getting the answers, but it looks kind of like the way congressional oversight is supposed to function. And people are interested in something that is objectively very important. On the other hand, the questions of who said what, when, with what intent, and with what interpretation about the second strike are very narrow once you start really drilling down on it.</p>
</details>

从某种程度上说，这可以说是在分散人们对从一开始就显而易见的更广泛问题的注意力，而这个问题不仅限于第二次导弹袭击，而是所有导弹袭击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in a way that is arguably distracting from the broader issue that has been apparent from the beginning and is not limited to the second missile strike but to all the missile strikes. Mhm.</p>

美国正在进行一场极其法律边缘化，至少可以说，具有致命后果的行动。而“这是否是一场武装冲突？这到底是不是一场战争？”这个更广泛的问题笼罩着整个事件。

<p class="english-text">The United States is engaged in an extraordinary legally edgy to say the least operation with literally deadly consequences. And the broader issue of is this an armed conflict? Is this a war at all? Hangs over the entire thing.</p>
</details>

如果这不是一场战争，如果这不是一场武装冲突，即使特朗普说他认定这是一场战争，那么有问题的就不只是9月2日第二次导弹袭击造成的两起死亡事件。已经发生了21次船只袭击，83人被杀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if it's not a war, if it's not an armed conflict, even if Trump says he's determined that it is one, then it's not just those two deaths from that second missile on September 2nd that are an issue. There have been 21 boat strikes. 83 people have been killed.</p>
</details>

如果这不是一场武装冲突，那么所有83起杀戮都可以说是谋杀。
