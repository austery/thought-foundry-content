### 认知差异：我们的大脑远比想象中不同

我们常常认为，其他人看待世界的方式与我们相似。然而，2015年一件连衣裙的颜色引发的争议，却让我们意识到，即使面对相同的现实，不同的大脑也会产生截然不同的感知。演讲者Alex Rosenthal认为，我们的思维方式比我们想象的更加不同，而与不同思维的人合作，才是创造奇迹的关键。他通过自己的经历，揭示了大脑多样性的奇妙之处。

So in 2015,
a bride-to-be uploaded a picture
of a dress to the internet --
(Laughter)
And we all lost our minds.
If you see this as blue
and black, say “Team blue.”
Audience: Team blue!
If you see this as white and gold, how?
How do you see that as white and gold?
(Laughter)
Why does this break our brains so much?
It's because it puts us into confrontation
with the fact that two minds
can perceive the same reality
entirely differently.
I'd like to talk to you about two things.
One, our minds are much
more different than we think.
And two, you should seek out minds
that are different than your own,
because that's where the magic happens.

### 无心象觉：一种独特的认知体验

Rosenthal分享了他自己独特的认知体验——**无心象觉**（Aphantasia: 无法在脑海中形成图像）。他无法在脑海中“看到”图像，即使在进行可视化练习时，也一片空白。这种现象并非罕见，大约有2-4%的人口患有无心象觉，而另有3-6%的人则拥有**超心象觉**（Hyperphantasia: 能够以极高的细节进行可视化，甚至可以将想象中的事物叠加到现实中）。每个人都处于一个连续的光谱上，体验着不同程度的视觉想象能力。

So if you'll indulge me for a second,
please visualize the following.
You can do it with your eyes
open or closed,
whichever gives you
the most vivid mental imagery.
A rocket ship crash lands
on an alien planet.
A creature comes up
to the hatch and knocks.
And someone opens it from within.
So now I'm going to ask you
some questions about what you just saw.
What color was the planet?
What kind of creature was it?
And who opened the hatch?
I'll show you what I see.
Nothing.
That's because I have
a condition called aphantasia,
which is where I don't have access
to my mind's eye.
It turns out that the mind's
eye is a spectrum.
On one end are about two
to four percent of us with aphantasia.
And at the other extreme
is hyperphantasia.
That's where you can visualize
in exquisite detail,
sometimes even able to superimpose
what you're imagining on reality.
That's about three
to six percent of people.
Everyone else is somewhere in between.

### 重新定义“正常”：拥抱神经多样性

Rosenthal意识到，长期以来，我们倾向于将与“正常”大脑功能不同的认知体验视为病态。但他认为，这种观念是错误的。不存在绝对的“正常”，差异本身并非缺陷。相反，这些差异是通往我们各自独特的认知世界的线索，而我们却往往因为只拥有自己的视角而无法窥见全貌。**神经多样性**（Neurodiversity: 大脑功能上的自然变异）应该被视为一种宝贵的财富，而非需要被矫正的缺陷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The norm is to pathologize
these experiences
into a list of conditions
that depart from a so-called
“normal” functioning of the mind.
I think we're thinking
about this completely wrong.
There is no true normal out there,
and difference is not deviance.
Rather, these are all clues
towards a vast and profound star field
we're each individually blinded to
because we only have our one
cozy, inescapable mind
as a single reference point.

### 多元思维的优势：创新与合作的力量

研究表明，自闭症谱系人群在模式识别和逻辑推理方面表现出色；患有多动症的学生在创造性问题解决和发散性思维任务中通常优于同龄人；阅读障碍者在高级空间推理方面也具有优势。因此，如果差异是常态，我们应该积极寻求与自己思维方式不同的人合作，共同创造非凡的成果。多元化的团队能够产生更优越的成果，而多元化的思维则能带来奇迹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
It's no secret that different
people think differently.
Many people on the autism spectrum
excel at pattern recognition
and logical deduction.
Multiple studies have shown
students with ADHD outperforming,
on average, their peers,
at creative problem solving
and divergent thinking tasks,
and there are very similar
findings for dyslexia,
especially when it comes
to advanced spatial reasoning.
So if difference is in fact the norm,
what do we do with that?
I say seek out minds
that are different than your own
and make something incredible together.

### 实践：拥抱差异，创造价值

越来越多的公司，如SAP、惠普和摩根大通，开始实施招聘神经多样性人才的计划，并报告了生产力、士气、创新和质量的相应提升。Rosenthal也亲身经历了这种优势，通过与不同思维的人合作，创造出令人惊叹的作品，例如一部关于分形几何的黑色电影动画，以及一款融合了拼图和逃脱室元素的创新游戏。他最终认识到，自己的大脑虽然与众不同，但却让他找到了最适合自己的位置，并从中获得了巨大的快乐和成就感。

<summary>Original English</summary>
There's a wealth of research
that shows that teams of people
from diverse backgrounds
produce superior outcomes.
I'd like to propose a corollary to this:
diverse minds working together
can produce wonders.
This comes with challenges
and opportunities.
So in the last decade or so,
companies such as SAP,
Hewlett Packard and JPMorgan
have started programs
designed to recruit neurodivergent talent.
And in the time since, they've reported
corresponding gains in productivity,
morale, innovation and quality.
