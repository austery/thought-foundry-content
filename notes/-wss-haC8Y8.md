### 生日感言：社群的力量与感恩之心

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是10月27日，星期一，我们正在直播。这是我正式满28岁后，第一次为大家带来《市场开盘》。今天就是过去364天里大家一直祝我生日快乐的日子，今天才是我的生日。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Monday, October 27th. We are live. It is the first market open coming to everybody from someone who is now officially 28 years old. It's actually the day that you all have been wishing happy birthday for for the past 364 days. Today is actually the day for us to have my birthday.</p>
</details>

这事儿成了个梗，真的很有趣。我甚至不知道祝别人生日快乐怎么就成了一个梗，但它确实发展到了一个程度，以至于 Tom Lee 在八月份时都以为是我的生日，因为你们一群人都在那么说。我不知道他今天看到我真正的生日会作何感想。但不管怎样，我们开播了，我今天正式28岁了。感谢大家来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's so funny that this thing became a meme. It's like I don't even know how it became a meme of just wishing someone happy birthday, but it came it became a meme to such an extent that Tom Lee thought it was my birthday back in August because a bunch of you guys said it and I don't know if he's going to see my actual birthday today and what he's going to say, but there we go. We're live and officially 28 years old today. Thank everybody for being here.</p>
</details>

我们有很多内容要谈，有很多东西要深入。我们有中美贸易的最新消息，这对市场显然非常重要。你可以看到，现在盘前市场一片翠绿。这大概是我能收到的最好的生日礼物了，整个市场创下历史新高。Palantir 今天或许能冲上190美元，那将非常棒。我们还有一系列宏观更新，似乎都对即将到来的降息相当利好。劳动力市场数据和其他一些因素，至少在帮助我们形成盘前的一些上涨势头，这也非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. We got this China US trade update which obviously is very important for the markets and you can see right now in the pre-markets we are greeny green. It's the best birthday gift I guess you could ask and all-time high across the market. Maybe Palantir push for 190 today which would be very nice. We got a bunch of different macro updates that seem to be pretty bullish in regards to rate cuts coming up. Uh labor market data and a few other things that seem to be at least helping the way we have some of this pre-market momentum which is also really important.</p>
</details>

然后是财报。盘前有几家公司的财报非常重要，值得一谈。我们也会聊聊盘后的一些财报。明天早上有 SoFi、PayPal 和 UNH。之后，周四有亚马逊和苹果，周三有微软、谷歌和 Meta，同时周三还有降息决定——**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会，负责制定美国货币政策）的决议。有96.7%的概率我们会迎来一次降息。所以，这将是极其疯狂的一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then we have earnings. We have a couple of earnings in the pre-market that are pretty important to talk about. We'll talk about some earnings after the close as well. But tomorrow we got SoFi, PayPal, and UNH in the morning. And then after that, you've got Amazon, Apple on Thursday, Microsoft, Google, and Meta on Wednesday along with rate cuts on Wednesday. The FOMC decision. There's a 96.7% chance we're going to get a rate cut. So, it is just going to be a wild, wild week.</p>
</details>

这是需要大家全神贯注的一周。在这样的一周里，投资组合可能会出现巨大的波动，希望是向上的。至少目前，我们正在经历向上的波动。我想这里的大多数人，可能仅在盘前市场就已经收复了过去几周的全部损失，甚至可能投资组合创下了新高。所以，这非常非常令人兴奋。我们有很多内容要聊，很多事情要开始，我很激动能在这里和大家又共度一天。是的，Amcore 也会在盘后发布财报。我们会谈到所有这些，以及今天晚些时候的其他财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it's a week for everyone to lock in. This is a week where, you know, portfolios can really take some massive swings hopefully to the upside. At least right now, we're experiencing to the upside. I mean, I think the majority of people here probably are recovering anything they lost over the past couple weeks in the pre-markets alone, potentially even even hitting new all-time highs in the portfolio. So, very very very exciting stuff. We got a lot to get into, a lot to get going, and I am excited to be here uh for another day to to talk to everybody. Yes, we have Amcore earnings after the bell as well. So, we'll get into all that and uh we'll see all the other earnings we have later today.</p>
</details>

再次感谢大家的生日祝福。我想我在这里花几分钟说点什么，然后我们再进入市场开盘环节。首先，我会在节目最后统一回复所有的超级留言，这样我们可以在节目结束时一次性处理，我也可以逐一感谢大家。但是，看，我对自己所处的位置感到非常、非常感激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, thank you everybody for the happy birthday wishes. I guess I'll just take like a couple minutes right here and just say something and then we'll get into we'll get into the market open. First of all, I I just um I'll get to all the super chats at the end as well so we can just do them all at once at at the end of the show and um I can individually thank everybody. But look, I am very, very very grateful to be in the position I'm in.</p>
</details>

我想随着年龄的增长，你会开始更多地反思自己的生活。一本关于 Karp 的书即将出版，我整个周末都在读这本书。这是关于他生平的，一本关于 Karp 的自传。所以，当我读着这本关于一个从根本上改变了我生活的人的书时——更不用说他改变了我们许多人的生活，我今天能站在这里的原因之一就是因为我选择冒险去分析他的公司——这真的让我对自己的生活进行了反思，思考过去28年里发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think as you get older, you start reflecting a little bit more on your life. This book about Karp is coming out. I read this entire book over the weekend and uh you know, it's about his life. It's an autobiography on Karp. And so as I was reading this book on someone who has fundamentally changed my life, much less changed so many of our lives and you know one of the reasons I'm even here today is because I I I chose to take a chance on analyzing his company. It really made me reflective about my life and just thinking about what has happened over the past 28 years.</p>
</details>

而我更多地思考了过去四年发生的事情，也就是这个社群的建立。我认为，作为人类，我们都能认同的最内在、最客观的要素之一，就是我们所有人都需要社群。无论你是民主党人还是共和党人，无论你的种族、性别如何，归根结底，你需要一个社群来获得某种程度上有意义的幸福。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and more than anything I thought about what has happened over the past four years which is you know this entire community being built. I think I think one of the most intrinsic elements, the most objectively intrinsic things that we can all agree on as a species is that all of us need community. You know, whether you're Democrat, Republican, no matter what race, gender, it's like at the end of the day, you need a community for some level of meaningful happiness.</p>
</details>

一生都奉行个人主义，只关心自己，是很难的。因为生活中的所有收获，无论是职业上的成功还是财务上的成功，如果没有情感上的收获，就很难去庆祝。而很多情感上的收获来自于与一个社群共同庆祝你的胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really hard to just be individualistic your entire life and only care about yourself. uh because because all the gains of life, whether it's through through professional success, financial success, it's hard to celebrate it if there's no emotional gains. And a lot of those emotional gains come from celebrating your wins with a community.</p>
</details>

所以，在过去28年里，我最引以为豪的事情之一，就是我不知何故培养出了一套培养社群所必需的技能，然后在过去四年里，我以勤奋的工作将这个社群建设到今天的规模。我必须说，如果没有你们，我不会在这里。我不会每天早上都出现在这里。我不可能处于现在的位置。我不会得到所有这些公司邀请我参加活动的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, uh I I I just think one of the things I'm the most proud of over the past 28 years that I've been able to do is is somehow develop a skill set that would be necessary to cultivate a community and then over the past four years have the work ethic to to build this community to be where it is today. And I would not be here, if I don't say this enough, I would not be here without you guys. I would not be here every morning. I would not be able to be in this position. I would not get the opportunities I get to to be invited to these events from all these uh you know, companies that that want to talk to me.</p>
</details>

除非有一群在乎的观众，否则我不可能被邀请去和所有这些CEO做播客。正是因为你们的在乎，以及你们在过去四年里对我的旅程如此支持，这真的是……我甚至不知道该说什么。这是一生难求的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would not be able to be invited to go do podcasts with all these CEOs unless there was there was an audience that cared. And the fact that you guys cared and the fact that you guys have been so happy about my journey over the past four years, I mean, it's it's it's it's I don't even know what to say. It is it is the journey of a lifetime.</p>
</details>

在像今天这样的日子里，随着年龄的增长，你会开始对自己一生中所做的事情感到非常、非常感激。你真的想确保让人们知道你有多感激，因为时间稍纵即逝。我们不知道自己在这个星球上还有多少时间。这就是变老的悖论。你在一边庆祝生命，但同时，客观地说，你也在一步步接近生命的终点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And on a day like today, as you get older, you start to get really really grateful over the things that you've done in your life. And you really want to make sure that you let people know how grateful you are because time is fleeting. We don't know how much time we have on this planet. That's the uh that's the what is it? That's the paradox of getting older. It's like you're celebrating life, but at the same time, you are getting closer to the end of life if we're just, you know, being objective about it.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，在这些时刻，让人们知道你对你所经历的旅程有多在乎，以及你有多感激他们在这段旅程中给予的支持，是至关重要的。即使他们没有参与旅程的每一个部分，即使他们没有被旅程的每一个部分所影响，但他们曾是其中的一部分，这个事实就意味着一切，真的很难用言语来形容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think in these moments it's really really important to just let people know how much you care about the journey that you've been on and and how much you appreciate the support that they've had on that journey. Even if they've not been on every part of that journey and even if they've not been affected by every part of the journey, the fact that they've been part of it is it it just means the world and there's there's really uh there there's really not many words to describe that.</p>
</details>

好了，谢谢大家。我很感激。如果今天也是你的生日，也祝你生日快乐。我看到有几个人也说今天是他们的生日。真是太不可思议了。77s说他今天38岁了。我喜欢这个。28岁，38岁，我们都在这里，我们都活着。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So there we go. Thank you everybody. Appreciate it. If it's your birthday as well today, happy birthday to you as well. I think I see a couple other people that say it's their birthday. So, pretty incredible. 77s says I'm 38 today. I love it. 2838, we're here. We're alive.</p>
</details>

感谢大家的超级留言。我会在节目快结束时再读，这样我们可以一次性处理完所有事情。但再次，我发自内心地、深深地、深深地感激你们所有人，是你们让我能够每天都活在我的梦想之中。有人说我说话像70岁的老人，问我是不是快不行了。不，我不是。但我想确保人们明白我有多感激。能处在这样的位置是一种极大的荣幸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you all for the super chats. I'll read them towards the end of the show so we can get through everything. But once again, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply appreciate from the bottom of my heart all of you guys allow me to live my dream every single day. Man's talking like he's 70 years old. Are you dying of it? No, I'm not. But just like look, I I really do want to make sure people understand how grateful I am. This is a very privileged position to be in this situation.</p>
</details>

我知道我为了走到今天付出了极大的努力，但无论你多么努力，你仍然需要一点运气。你需要有人欣赏你的笑话，而你们确实欣赏。YouTube上有很多主播试图让人们笑，但没人理会，而你们却在乎。当然，有人可能会说你们是在嘲笑我，而不是和我一起笑。但重点是，只要有笑声，这真的不重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and and I know I've worked my ass off to get here, but no matter how hard you work, you still you need a little bit of of luck on your side in terms of, you know, you need people to laugh at your jokes, and you guys laugh. You guys really do laugh. I mean, there's a lot of people on YouTube that try to go live and get people to laugh at their jokes, and no one cares, and you guys care. Now, one would argue you're laughing at me, not with me. But the point is, as long as there's a laugh, it really doesn't matter.</p>
</details>

你们选择笑，选择在这里，这对我意义重大。真的，真的非常重要。我希望有一天能当面感谢你们每一个人。我们离2026年越来越近了，届时我会公布更多关于粉丝见面会的细节。希望很多人能来参加，我能亲自感谢每一位社群成员。这个社群是我乐于从事这份工作的原因。我每天都因为能做这件事而感到活着是幸福的。而这件事能给参与我们日常活动的每一个人带来任何程度的快乐，这对我来说就意味着全世界。真的，这对我来说意味着一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, the fact that you guys choose to laugh and choose to be here, it means a lot. It really, really, really means a lot. And I wish I could thank each of you in person one day. So, so, you know, we're getting closer to 2026. I'm going to have more details on the meetups. Hopefully, a lot of people can come to those meetups. And, uh, I can individually thank every single person in person for for being part of this community. I mean, this community is is is the reason why I'm I'm happy to be doing what I'm doing. I mean, I am happy to be alive on a daily basis because I get to do this. And the fact that this could bring any level of happiness to the people that are part of what we're doing every day, it just means the world. It really truly it it means everything to me.</p>

### 市场概览：普涨行情与关键动态

好了，我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。让我们进入正题。现在市场情况如何？嗯，一片绿色。我们是绿油油的，甚至比昨晚还要绿。标普500指数期货是68205，现在是68272。特斯拉涨了1%，Palantir涨了2%，Robinhood涨了3.1%，可能要重返150美元。Grab回到了6美元以上。谷歌264美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. Let's get into it. What do we got going on? Well, we're green. We are greeny green and we are even more green than where we were last night. We had 68205. We're at 68272. Tesla's up 1%. Palantir's up 2%. Hoodie is up 3.1% potentially making its way back to 150. Grab back above $6. Google 264.</p>
</details>

谷歌周末确认与Anthropic签署了一项大协议。Anthropic将购买大量的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Units: 张量处理单元，谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路）。这确实在提振谷歌现在的股价。Reddit涨了3%。亚马逊，向所有和我一起买入亚马逊的朋友们致敬。213、215、217，甚至222美元。过去几周确实是个好机会，现在亚马逊股价上涨至228美元。希望在财报公布前我们能突破230美元的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google signed a big deal with Anthropic. It was confirmed over the weekend. Massive level of TPUs are going to be or going to be purchased by Anthropic. So, that's really helping Google price right now. Reddit's up 3%. Amazon, shout out to everyone who bought Amazon with me. 213, 215, 217, even 222. I mean literally there like it's just been a great opportunity over the past couple weeks and you got Amazon moving higher 228. Hopefully we can crack that 230 level before we get into earnings.</p>
</details>

英伟达回到190美元。很高兴看到Palantir在189美元。也许今天Palantir和英伟达会成为双胞胎。Palantir就在那里，189.04美元。MicroStrategy在涨，ASML在涨，Hims回到50美元以上。Roblox在涨，CrowdStrike在涨，Coinbase在涨，CoreWeave在涨，Rocket Lab在涨，Nebius在涨。看，Nebius涨到了121.95美元。Iren也在涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Nvidia back to 190. Very nice to see. Palantir 189. Maybe Palantir and Nvidia are going to be twins today. You got Palantir right there. 189.04. Micro strategy is up. ASML is up. Him's back above 50. Roblox is up. Crowd Strike is up. Coinbase is up. Coreweave is up. Rocket Lab is up. Nebius is up. Look at that. 121.95 on Nebius. Iren is up.</p>
</details>

这是一个非常非常大规模的上涨日，说实话，这背后有多种原因。我是否会看到一些抛售，一些人获利了结？当然，我们已经看到了。一些盘前价格比昨晚要低。所以，如果我们看到这种情况，我认为不应该让任何人感到恐慌。但趋势是向好的，我们今天会花很多时间从宏观和地缘政治的角度来讨论这个趋势，并最终得出结论，如果这个趋势持续下去，我认为市场在未来几个月会走向何方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it's just a massive, massive day, which to be honest, look, is very green for a variety of reasons. Could I see a little bit of a sell-off, a little bit of people taking some profits? Of course, we're already seeing that. Some of these pre-market prices are lower than where they were last night. So, I don't think that should scare anyone if we see that. But the trend is on the right side, and we're going to spend a lot of time today talking about the trend from a macro perspective and geopolitical perspective, and ultimately the conclusion on where I think this market can go over the next coming months if we continue this trend.</p>
</details>

关于SoFi，我周五又买了500股。我没有做收盘直播。老实说，我只是在收盘时感觉不太好。这是我忘了提的另一件事。我发帖说我不会做收盘直播，帖子下面的评论数量之多，很多人说：“兄弟，我们爱你，但你已经是我们日程的一部分了，希望你早日康复，因为错过收盘直播确实会影响我们的生活，我们希望生活中有这一部分。”这对我意义重大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SoFi, I did buy another 500 shares on Friday. I didn't go live on the market close. Um, honestly, I just I just really wasn't feeling the best in the market close. And that that was another thing I forgot to mention. Like I I I posted I I wasn't going to go live on the market close. And the amount of comments underneath that post that uh you know just said, "Dude, we love you, but you are part of our schedule and uh we hope you get better because you know, missing the market close is something that actually affects our lives because we you know, we we we want to have that part of our life." I mean, that means a lot.</p>
</details>

当然，还有很多其他评论暗示我的喉咙痛是因为我在Grindr上约会。那是另一个话题了。那些评论大概占了20%。但另外80%的评论非常友善，也让我感到非常谦卑，知道我真的希望能直播。我只是感觉糟透了。我不知道周五发生了什么，但我觉得如果我不能付出100%的努力，那就不值得直播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there were a lot of other comments suggesting that my throat was hurting because I was on a grinder date. And that's that's that's for another conversation. Those were those were those were about 20% of the comments. But the other 80% of comments, which is very very nice, and it was very very humbling to uh to know that I really wish I want I could go live. I just I felt horrible, dude. I don't know what was happening on Friday, but I felt if I couldn't give my full 100% then it wasn't worth going live.</p>
</details>

但是，我周五又买了500股SoFi。我没法说，因为我没直播，所以没法宣布。但是，30.10美元，我的平均成本现在是29.5美元。让我们看看Noto能否给我们带来35美元的价位。我有一千股。我们明天早上就会看到SoFi会发生什么，以及我们是否能继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um look, I bought another 500 shares of SoFi on Friday. I I I couldn't say anything because I didn't go live, so I couldn't announce it. But $30.10, my average is now $29.5. I mean, let's see if Noto can give us that 35 level. Have a,000 shares. And we're going to see tomorrow morning what happens with SoFi and if uh if we can keep going from there.</p>
</details>

New Bank在涨，DoorDash在涨，达美航空在涨，京东在涨，Oklo在涨，Anduril在涨，Big Bear AI也在涨。很多过去几周大幅回调的动量股开始有所回升。所以这几乎是一场全面反弹。AMD 259美元。这几乎是一场全面反弹。唯一在跌的是黄金，这实际上是利好，因为你不想看到一个避险资产在市场上涨时也上涨，因为这往往有点不稳定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">New Bank is up, Door Dash is up, Delta's up, JD is up, Oklo is up, you've got Anduril that is up. Big Bear AI that is up. A lot of the momentum stocks that took a bit a big a bit of a draw down over the past couple weeks, those are starting to recover a bit. So, it's pretty much an everything rally. AMD 259. It is pretty much an everything rally. The only thing that's down is gold, which is actually bullish because you don't want a risk-off asset rallying while the market's rallying because it tends to be a little wonky.</p>
</details>

当然，黄金在今年上涨60%后下跌了几个百分点。但这确实预示着市场可能更偏向于风险偏好（risk on）而非风险规避（risk off）。我知道黄金传统上被视为避险资产，但也许在今年上涨60%之后，黄金现在本身也成了风险资产。但你确实看到一些大宗商品交易出现疲软，这可能对股市有利，因为更多的资金可能会转向承担更多风险。更多风险意味着我们都拥有的这些风险资产，比如科技股，往往会表现得更好，这非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, granted, gold is down a couple percentage points after being up 60% for the year. But it does signal maybe there's a little bit more risk on versus risk off. And I know gold is conventionally seen as risk-off, but maybe after the 60% rally this year, gold is now risk. But you are seeing a little bit of weakness in some of the commodity trades which potentially is good for the equity markets as more of that money maybe transitions into taking more risk. More risk means more of these risk assets that we all own like tech stocks tend to do a little bit better which is very exciting to see.</p>
</details>

稀土今天下跌，原因是根据特朗普的言论，看起来他们正在就稀土金属和矿物达成协议，这意味着对那些国内稀土股票供应商的需求依然存在，只是可能不会达到三周前我们以为中美正在脱钩时的水平。所以这些股票才会下跌。我能预见它们会复苏，但不知道是否能很快回到历史高点。尽管如此，如果中国供应稀土，这对更广泛的美国供应链是有利的，对整个股市也是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rare earths are down today and the reason rare earths are down is because it does look like based on what Trump said and we have a couple clips to watch uh that they are getting to an agreement on rare earth metals and minerals which means the demand for the domestic suppliers of those rare earth stocks. I mean that demand is still going to be there. It's just not going to be potentially at the level that it was three weeks ago when we thought that China and the US were decoupling. And so that's why those stocks are down. I can see them recovering. I don't know if they get back to all-time highs anytime soon, but nonetheless, uh, it is good for the broader American supply chain if we have China supplying rare earths. And, you know, that's good for the broader equity markets as well.</p>
</details>

是的，在这样的一天，稀土并不那么稀有了。它们之前上涨是因为我们以为不再和中国做朋友了。如果我们要和中国做朋友，看起来确实如此，那么它们可能就不会上涨了。但除此之外，你还有很多其他的风险资产正在获得动力，这非常非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yeah, not so rare earths on a day like I mean, you know, they were rallying because we thought we were not going to be friends with China anymore. If we're going to be friends with China, which it seems like we are, then they probably wouldn't rally. But outside of that, you got a lot of other risk on assets that are just getting momentum and it is very, very exciting.</p>

看，Lululemon涨了。它真的涨了吗？Lululemon。哇，Lulu涨了5%。我的天，除非今天出现一些抛售，否则很难找到下跌的股票。这是一场基础广泛的市场反弹。我们即将进入年底。让我们来谈谈这次广泛反弹的一些原因。但我很好奇，我们今天收盘时到底是红是绿，我们能否保持住这股势头，以及哪些股票会失去一些动力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">See, Lululemon is up. Is that actually up? Lululemon. Wow. Lulu's up 5%. I mean, dude, it's going to be hard to find unless we get a bit of a selloff today. It's going to be hard to I mean, this is a broad-based market rally. We're getting into the end of the year. Let's get into some of the reason for why we are seeing this broad-based rally. But I'd be very curious to see if we actually end the day red or green and if we can hold on to this momentum and what stock lose a little bit of steam.</p>
</details>

我认为今天会是上涨的一天。我能预见到午盘时段可能会有一些抛售，或许是从历史高点获利了结，但我认为鉴于许多叙事催化剂已经开始朝着对多头有利的方向发展，下行势头不足。如果这些趋势持续下去，我们可能会看到更多的上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think it's going to be a green day. I I I could see a little bit of a sell-off towards the middle of the day, maybe taking some profits from the all-time highs, but I I don't think this is enough momentum to the downside given how many of the narrative catalysts have started to come in the direction of the bulls and if those continues, you know, we probably continue to get a bit more a bit more green.</p>
</details>

Lululemon与NFL合作了？真的吗？好吧，原来如此。Lulu和NFL。我想这足以推高股价了。他们确实需要一些不同的东西。是的，Lululemon正在与NFL合作，为所有32支NFL球队推出一个服装系列。嗯，好吧。NFL现在很火。NFL的广告投放达到了历史新高。NFL的预测市场规模巨大。所以，看起来Lulu正在利用这部分市场关注度，这也应该对他们有帮助。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get Lulu partnered with the NFL. Really? Okay. Well, there you go. Lulu and the NFL. I guess that's enough to pump up the stock. So, I mean, they definitely needed something different. Yeah. Lulu is partnering with the NFL to launch an apparel collection for all 32 NFL teams, huh? Okay. I mean, the NFL is hot right now. You got advertising on the NFL reaching all-time highs. You have the prediction markets being massive for the NFL. So, looks like Lulu is tapping into some of that mind share, and that should be helping them as well.</p>

### 中美贸易关系现曙光，市场情绪高涨

好了，让我们来谈谈我们手头的一些话题。首先，中国方面发生了什么？周末有很多关于Bessent的言论，其中很多内容都相当利好。以下是他的说法，以及市场为何因他对中国的评论而上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into a bunch of the talks we have. First of all, what's going on with China? We got a lot of quotes by Bessent over the weekend and a lot of this stuff is pretty bullish. Here is what he said and here is why the markets are rallying based off his comments in regards to China.</p>
</details>

这是我与我的中国同行，副总理何立峰的第五次会晤，我们讨论了广泛的议题，我认为我们已经为两位领导人下周四在韩国的会晤达成了一个实质性的框架。总统在威胁如果中国实施稀土全球出口管制，将征收100%关税时，给了我最大的筹码。所以我认为我们已经避免了这种情况。因此，关税将被避免，我们与中国有定期的季度会议。原定于11月10日或之前举行，我认为我们不必再开了。我们一直在按季度滚动关税，所以我们对此达成了共识。我们还就美国农民的大量农产品采购达成了一致。我们同意中国将开始帮助我们处理用于制造芬太尼这种可怕流行病的前体化学品，这种流行病正在蹂躏我们的国家。所以，我想说，总的来说，这是一次非常好的会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was the fifth meeting that I've had with my Chinese counterpart, the vice premier He Lifeng and we covered a wide range of issues and I think we've reached a substantial framework for the two leaders who will meet in Korea next Thursday. So uh you know on the on the table the president had given me maximum leverage when he threatened 100% tariffs if the Chinese impose their rare earth uh global export controls. So I think we have averted that. So the the tariffs will be averted and we have a regular meeting regular quarterly meeting uh with the Chinese. uh it was scheduled for November 10th or before November 10th. I don't think we will have to have that. So uh we have been rolling the tariffs quarterly. So we agreed on that. We also agreed on substantial agriculture purchases for US farmers. We agreed that the Chinese would begin to help us uh with the precursor chemicals for this terrible fentanyl epidemic that's ravaging our country. So I would say that it was a very good meeting overall.</p>
</details>

不仅Bessent这么说，中国驻美大使馆昨天也表示，双方同意，在两国元首的战略引领下，将充分利用中美经贸磋商机制，就各自关切保持密切沟通，推动经贸关系健康可持续发展，造福两国人民，为全球繁荣做出贡献。所以，基本上中国方面同意了Bessent的说法，即我们将与美国合作，促成一项协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean you're hearing it right there from Bessent and then not only did Bessent say that the Chinese embassy and the US this is what they said yesterday. Uh both sides agree that the strategic guidance of the two heads of state they will make full use of the Chinese US economic trading consultation mechanism maintain close communication on respective concerns and promote the healthy sustainable development of economic and trade relations to benefit the two peoples and contribute to global prosperity. So, I mean, you've got the Chinese basically agreeing with Bessent right there that we are going to be uh working with the US to actually make a deal happen.</p>
</details>

然后，特朗普确认谈判进展顺利，或者至少初步会谈进展顺利，他很快将在中国或美国与习近平会面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you've got Trump confirming that uh negotiations are going so well or at least initial talks are going so well that he's going to be meeting Xi pretty soon either in China or in the US.</p>
</details>

我们基本同意我会去中国。那是什么时候？在年初的时候。好的，之后习主席可能会来华盛顿、棕榈滩或其他地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We pretty much agreed that I'll be going to China. When is that? In the earlier part of the year. Okay. and President Xi will be coming into maybe Washington or Palm Beach or someplace sometime after that.</p>
</details>

如果在10月10日我们市场出现3%的回调是因为中国那条关于美国说中国在稀土问题上咄咄逼人，我们不买他们大豆之类的推文，而现在那个原因似乎已经不那么重要了。这不意味着我们已经达成了协议，但确实意味着我们似乎有了一个能导向友好结果的协议框架。特朗普甚至邀请习近平到白宫。我真的不知道，也许我太天真了，但在11月1日或10月30日他们在韩国会面时，特朗普正在从马来西亚回来的路上，我想他昨晚去了日本，所以他应该在几天内回到美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if the reason we had a 3% draw down on October 10th was because of the China tweet around the United States basically saying hey China's being aggressive with rare earths and we're not going to buy their soybeans yada yada and now that reason seems to be all but not as relevant. It doesn't mean we have a deal yet but it does mean it looks like we have a framework for a deal that will result in something friendly. I mean, Trump's literally inviting Xi to the White House. I really I don't know, maybe I'm being naive about it, but on November 1st or October 30th when they meet in South Korea, uh Trump is on his way back from Malaysia as we speak. I think he's he's actually went to Japan last night, so he should be coming back to the US in in a couple days.</p>
</details>

我很难相信，在Bessent进行了所有这些富有成效的对话之后，他们最终会无法达成协议，尤其是在年底。特朗普知道中期选举即将来临，他也知道这是他担任总统第一年的尾声。你想通过一些标志性的立法。显然，那项“大而美的法案”是最重要的，但下一件大事就是与中国、印度等国锁定这些贸易协议。我们已经和日本、韩国、欧洲达成了协议。如果我们能与主要国家锁定协议，不仅市场会喜欢，对整体经济健康也可能非常有益。考虑到我们正在面临赤字，我们确实需要贸易协议来促进GDP增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's hard for me to believe that after all these productive conversations that Bessent has had that they're going to end up with no deal, especially towards the end of the year. Trump knows the midterms are coming up. Trump knows this is the end of his first year as being president. I mean you want to get some landmark legislation. Obviously big beautiful bill was the the most important thing but the next big thing is locking in these trade deals with China, India etc. We already have Japan, South Korea, Europe. If we can lock it in with the major nations, I mean not only would the markets like it, but that could also be very productive for the broader health of the economy. And given we are running up a a deficit, we do need the trade deals to contribute to GDP growth.</p>
</details>

所以，我不知道。感觉年底我们会有些乐子。十一月通常也是一年中最好的月份之一。所以现在你有了贸易协议的催化剂，有了我们稍后会讨论的更广泛的财报催化剂，然后十一月又比预期的要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I don't know, dude. It feels like we're going to have some fun towards the end of the year. November tends to be one of the best months of the year as well. Uh so now you've got the trade deal catalyst, you've got the broader earnings catalyst that we'll talk about in a second. And then you've got November being better than expected.</p>
</details>

然后你还有即将到来的降息，毕竟场外还有很多资金。随着这些资金进入场内，如果降息持续，它们可能会有更多动力离场观望。看起来有机会。我们年底可能会有一个非常非常强劲的收官。而且看起来现在可能正在上演这一幕。所以，这就是我们在中国动态背景下所看到的情况，而且看起来这势头一点也没有减弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, and then you got the rate cuts coming up where, you know, there is a lot of money on the sidelines at the end of the day. As that money gets to the sidelines, uh you know, it's going to have more of an incentive to potentially get off the sidelines if we continue to get rate cuts. Seems like there's a shot. Seems like there's a shot. We could have a really, really strong end of year. And it looks like that could be what's playing out right now. So, that's what we have in the context of the China updates and doesn't look like that's slowing down at all.</p>
</details>

### 重点公司动态：Palantir、Robinhood 及加密货币市场

再次感谢大家的生日祝福。深深感谢每一位的祝福。我现在28岁了，我们会继续努力。我们会像往常一样，每一天都继续努力。好了，这就是关于中国的情况。让我们来看看其他一些正在发生的事情。首先，Palantir。周末有传言说Palantir将与波兰签署一份意向书。现在已经正式确认了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you again for all the happy birthday wishes. Deeply, deeply appreciate everyone for the wishes. Your boy is now 28 and uh we're going to keep working. We're going to keep working every single day as usual. All right, so that's what we had for China. Let's get into some of the other stuff we got going on. First of all, Palantir, uh, there was rumors over the weekend that Palantir was going to be signing a letter of intent with Poland. It officially is confirmed.</p>
</details>

Palantir刚刚发推文说：“我们致力于服务波兰，并自豪地深化与国防部的合作关系。今天的协议为Palantir的人工智能防御技术开始迅速支持该国武装部队铺平了道路，因为他们在日益复杂的威胁环境中处于创新的前沿，并加强了波兰作为国防主权领导者的地位。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palantir just tweeted, "We are committed to Poland and proud to deepen our partnership with the Ministry of Defense. Today's agreement paves the way for Palantir's AI enabled defense technology to begin rapidly supporting the country's armed forces as they innovate at the forefront of an increasingly complex threat environment and strengthen Poland's position as a sovereign leader in defense."</p>
</details>

Palantir、波兰武装部队、波兰国防工业以及快速增长的波兰国防初创生态系统之间的技术合作，将使波兰成为国防人工智能领域的先驱和领导者。我认为这非常令人兴奋，因为上周你刚看到与Lumen签订了2亿美元的合同，这是另一家商业政府供应商。Palantir正在逐步建立多年的合作伙伴关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Technological collaboration between Palantir, the Polish armed forces, the Polish defend industry, and the rapidly growing Polish defense startup ecosystem will make Poland a pioneer and leader in AI for defense. Uh, I think this is really exciting because last week you had a $200 million contract with Lumen, which is another commercial government provider. Palantir, you know, really inching a multi-year partnership.</p>
</details>

Lumen的CEO在福克斯商业频道上说：“Alex走进我们的房间说，‘在我们向你们展示价值之前，不要付钱给我们。’他向我们展示了价值，这就是为什么我们现在为他的公司软件支付数亿美元。”看起来Palantir正在采取同样的方法，即价值是在实际展示软件影响之后产生的。他们可能在过去几个月里向波兰展示了他们的软件，现在波兰国防部希望采取更积极的方式与Palantir合作，这很合理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the CEO of Lumen was on Fox Business and said, "Alex came into our room and said, "Don't pay us until we can show you the value." and he showed us the value and that's why we're now paying him hundreds of millions of dollars for the company software and it looks like Palantir is taking that same approach which is the value is downstream from actually showing the impact of the software and they've probably shown their software over the past couple of months to Poland and now Poland's Ministry of Defense wants to take a more productive approach working with Palantir makes sense.</p>
</details>

毕竟，考虑到俄罗斯和乌克兰发生的一切，许多波罗的海国家显然希望采取更多的预防措施，Palantir已经与其中许多国家合作，包括立陶宛。现在看起来他们与波兰建立了正式的合作关系。看，这只股票离历史新高只差大约80美分。我认为我们有可能突破它。我们将在9:30市场开盘时看看它是否会被抛售，或者那里是否有一些阻力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean at at the end of the day with everything going on in Russia Ukraine a lot of the Baltic states obviously want to take more precautionary measures has worked with many of them including Lithuania And it looks like they now have an official partnership with Poland. I mean, look, the stock is about 80 cents away from an all-time high. I think there's a world where we can crack it. We're going to see at 9:30 when the market opens if it ends up getting dumped and or if there's a bit of resistance right there.</p>
</details>

是的，对于聊天室里所有波兰人来说，我看到很多来自波兰的人，看起来Palantir可能正在为整个国防部提供操作系统。所以这对Palantir来说非常令人兴奋，看起来这是另一笔好交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, for all the people that are Polish in the chat, I see a bunch of people that are from Poland. It looks like Palantir might be potentially uh powering the entire operating system for the Ministry of Defense. So very very exciting for Palantir and it looks like that is another good deal.</p>
</details>

关于Robinhood，我们收到了对Robinhood的评级上调，目标价为161美元。我们之所以得到161美元的目标价，是因为财报更新。Compass Point将他们的目标价从105美元提高到了161美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Robin Hood, we got an upgrade on Robin Hood 161 for Hoodie. Uh and the reason we got 161 is because of earnings updates. So you've got Compass Point. They raised their price target from 105 to 161.</p>
</details>

他们是这么说的：“我们对第三季度EBITDA的预测比市场普遍预期高出6%，我们预计Hood将披露10月份的趋势远超第四季度的预期。如果我们将我们的预测年化，交易收入仅比2026年的共识低2%。第四季度提供了额外的季度环比增长空间，同时预测市场交易量、加密货币费用定价和质押收入也会增加。”质押是许多分析师假设中尚未真正考虑到的因素之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's what they said. Our 3Q EBITDA forecast is 6% above the street and we expect Hood to disclose October trends pacing well above fourth quarter expectations. If we annualize our forecast, transaction revenue is only 2% below consensus for 2026. Fourth quarter offers additional upside quarter over quarter alongside higher prediction market volumes, crypto fee pricing, and staking revenue. Staking is one of those things that's not really baked into a lot of analysts assumptions yet.</p>
</details>

“虽然Hood的2026年市盈率为62倍，EBITDA倍数为43倍，交易价格存在溢价，但只要收入和EBITDA继续超出预期，我们对我们的‘买入’评级感到满意。我们将目标价提高到161美元。我们对2026年的每股收益预测比市场普遍预期高出7%，如果近期趋势持续，还有很大的上行空间。”看到Robinhood又获得一个目标价上调，尤其是在进入2026年之际，这非常令人高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While Hood trades at a premium of 62x or 2026 EPS and 43x EBITDA, we're comfortable with our buy rating as long as revenue EBIDA continue to exceed expectations. We increase our price target to 161. Our 2026 EPS is 7% above the street with a meaningful room for upside if recent trends persist. Very nice to see that you're getting another price target from Robin Hood, especially going into 2026.</p>
</details>

我认为很多人对Hood的一个担忧是，如果我们最终进入加密货币寒冬，或者市场虽然不是熊市，但缺乏向上的波动性，那么Hood的交易量就不会那么强劲。比特币目前在115,000美元，以太坊在4,100美元以上。如果这种情况在2026年没有发生，而且我确信我们在2026年会有一些10%到15%的回调，这每年都会发生。但如果大趋势保持不变，也许我们年底能达到7,000美元，到2026年可能更接近8,000美元，那么Robinhood很可能会成为一个关键角色，那些预测市场对公司继续表现良好也可能非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the concerns I think a lot of people have with Hood is that if we do end up in a crypto winter, if we end up in a little bit more of not a bearish market, but a lack of volatile market to the upside, Hood's transaction volumes won't be as strong. Bitcoin right there 115,000, Ethereum above 4,100. If that doesn't happen in 2026, and I'm sure we're going to have some draw downs in 2026 of 10% 15% that just tends to happen every single year. But if the broader trend is intact and you know maybe we end out the year 7,000 maybe we are much closer to 8,000 by 2026 then Robinhood's probably going to be a pivotal player and those prediction markets are also probably going to be very very important for the company to continue to do well.</p>
</details>

所以你看到了Robinhood带来的兴奋，这也导致了一些盘前交易的活跃。我的意思是，如果我们看到150美元，那将非常令人兴奋。我确实认为这次冲向150美元会更健康一些，这不仅仅是针对Robinhood。我认为很多这类股票，包括从140美元暴跌至96美元的Nebius，以及从150美元跌至120美元的Robinhood，它们现在能够反弹，尽管还没有完全回到历史高点，这是非常健康的，因为市场已经挤出了一些泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're getting some excitement right there from uh or excitement right there from Robin Hood and that's also leading to some of that pre-market action. I mean look if we see 150 it would be very exciting. I do think this 150 run would be a bit more healthier and it's not just for Robin Hood. I think a lot of these stocks, including a Nebius that took a nasty hit from 140 all the way down to 96, Robin Hood from 150 all the way down to 120, the fact that they're now gapping back up even though they're not fully at all time highs is very healthy because the market got a lot of the froth out of the system.</p>
</details>

所以，首先，你让很多卖家离场了，这是好事。其次，财报季即将到来。所以，如果Nebius和Hood能够超出财报预期，我认为他们会的，他们不是从历史高点开始向上突破，而是从低于历史高点的水平开始，这实际上让他们更容易达到新的历史高点。从历史上看，市场在获得一些收益之前需要经历一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you got a lot of the sellers to leave, which is good. Uh, and then number two, uh, you have earnings coming up. So, if Nebus and Hood can crush earnings, which I think they will, they are not starting at all-time highs in terms of making a move higher. They are starting at levels that are depressed from all-time highs, which actually makes it easier to get to new all-time highs. It just just, you know, historically when you look at the market, you need to have a little bit of pain before you have some gain.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为在整个市场范围内，以一种更健康的方式进入财报季是好事。显然，那些利用了这次下跌机会的人也从中受益了。所以，看到这些成长股的表现，我感到非常高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think across the entire board, it's it's a much healthier way to get into into the earning season. And obviously, those who took advantage of the dip have also benefited from that as well. So, very nice to see what's going on in the context of some of those growth stocks as well.</p>
</details>

好了，这就是关于Robinhood的情况。现在让我们转向加密货币方面的一些其他更新。首先是Bitmine，Tom Lee抄底了，虽然买入量没有很多人预期的那么多，但他确实买了331万美元。他们在周末购买了大约73,000个以太坊，或者说77,000个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so that's what you had on Robin Hood. And now let's transition over to a couple of other updates we have right here in the context of crypto. So first of all Bitmine uh Tom Lee bought the dip didn't buy as much as a lot of people expected but he did buy 3.31 million. They bought about 73,000 Ethereum or 77,000 Ethereum over the weekend.</p>
</details>

他说，美中贸易谈判的进展对以太坊和整个加密货币市场都是积极的。这些是全球性资产，几周前不断升级的紧张局势引发了加密货币有史以来最大规模的去杠杆事件。虽然以太坊和加密货币的基本面与股市不相关，但Fundstrat的研究表明，在过去15年中，当股市上涨时，以太坊和加密货币表现更好。这意味着加密货币通过相关的杠杆渠道与风险偏好资产相关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He says the progress and trade talks between the US and China is positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly. These are global assets and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging crypto event over a few weeks ago. While the fundamentals of Ethereum and crypto are uncorrelated to equities, Fundstrat work has shown that in the past 15 years, Ethereum and crypto perform better when equities rise. Meaning crypto is correlated to risk on assets via the associated leverage channel.</p>
</details>

所以，Bitmine现在拥有整个以太坊资产类别的2.8%。Bitmine股价为53.10美元，上涨了5.3%。以太坊终于突破了4000美元，过去两周它基本上被困在3700到3900美元之间。现在的问题是，到11月底，这个家伙能否冲上5000美元。我对此持乐观态度。我不知道我们是否已经计入了10000美元的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you've got Bitmine that now owns 2.8% of the entire asset class when it comes to Ethereum. Bitmine right there at 53.10. That's up 5.3%. I mean Ethereum finally breaking above 4,000. It was stuck at 3700 to 3,900 basically for the past 2 weeks. The question now is if this bad boy can gap up to 5,000 towards the end of November. And I'm optimistic that it can. I don't know if we have that 10,000 level baked into it.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，比特币，如果它就收在这个水平，我们将保持十月份的上涨势头，这基本上描述了我们有多少次十月份是上涨的。过去八个十月都是上涨的。所以，如果我们能继续，即使我们只上涨1.2%，那也会很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Bitcoin uh if it just closes at this level, we will have October continue to be intact, which is essentially a um as you can see right here, description of how many times we've had a green October. Last eight Octobers were green. So, if we can continue, even if we entered up by 1.2%. It would be nice.</p>
</details>

你为什么认为Bitmine没有买更多？以太坊在4000美元以下待了一周。是的，我也不太确定。也许他们只是更谨慎一些，因为他们认为如果中美贸易谈判进展不那么顺利，以太坊可能会跌到3200美元左右，那样他们就能以更好的价格买入，这是一个合理的风险回报评估。就像，嘿，也许中国的事情更多的是一个逆风因素，我们需要谨慎。所以他们尽可能多地买入，但没有到花光所有现金的程度，我认为这样做是合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you think Bitmine didn't buy more? ETH was under 4K for a week. Yeah, I'm not fully sure. I mean, maybe they were just being a little bit more hesitant because they thought if the China trade negotiations didn't go that well that Ethereum would tank to like 3,200 and that's where they could get a better price, which is a fair risk-reward assessment to make. It's like, hey, maybe, you know, maybe the China stuff is more of a um headwind and we need to be cautious. And so they bought as much as they could but not enough to the point where they would essentially spend all the cash that they had which I think is fair to do.</p>
</details>

但是，你确实看到很多这些公司金库在继续购买更多。甚至MicroStrategy今天也买了更多。他们已经有一段时间没有买这么多了，但今天Saylor先生购买了390个比特币，价值4340万美元，每个比特币111,000美元，现在他们的平均成本是74,000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh you do have a lot of these treasuries continuing to buy more. I mean even Micro Strategy today, Micro Strategy bought more. It has been a while since they bought as much as they did but 390 Bitcoin 43.4 million is what Mr. Sailor purchased today. 111,000 per Bitcoin and uh now their average is 74,000.</p>
</details>

所以，那些能够以溢价持续稀释股份的优秀公司，正在继续购买尽可能多的比特币，这对加密生态系统来说也是非常令人兴奋的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have the best companies that are able to continue diluting at a premium continuing to buy as much Bitcoin as they have which is very exciting for the crypto ecosystem as well.</p>

### 特朗普的外交风格及其市场影响

关于特朗普说过的一些话，还有一些其他的片段。首先，特朗普和埃隆，他今天早上实际上对埃隆·马斯克发表了一些评论。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, some other clips in regards to some of the things that Trump has said. First of all, uh, Trump and Elon, he actually gave some comments this morning about Elon Musk.</p>
</details>

你和埃隆最近关系怎么样？我认为很好。你看，在查理那场美丽的悼念仪式上，埃隆也来了。和埃隆关系不错。我喜欢埃隆。我一直都喜欢埃隆。埃隆很好。自那次悼念仪式后你们聊过吗？断断续续聊过一点。是的，很少，没什么大事。听着，他是个好人，也是个很有能力的人。我一直都喜欢他。他有过一段不好的时期，一个糟糕的时刻。那是他生命中一个愚蠢的时刻，非常愚蠢。我相信他也会这么告诉你。但我喜欢埃隆，我猜我将永远喜欢他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is your relationship with Elon these days? I think it's good. I mean, you saw that during Charlie's beautiful tribute, Elon came up. It's good with Elon. I like Elon. I've always liked Elon. Elon's good. Have you talked to him since the memorial? Uh, on and off a little bit. Yeah. Very little. Nothing much. Look, he's a nice guy and he's a very capable guy. Uh, I've always liked him. He had a bad spell. He had a bad period. He had a bad moment. It was a stupid moment in his life. very stupid. I'm sure I'm sure he'd tell you that. But uh I like Elon and I suspect I'll always like him.</p>
</details>

如果你是特斯拉的股东，看到这个是好事，因为归根结底，我们不能忘记特斯拉在未来四年仍然需要有利于他们自动驾驶和机器人技术发展的立法。所以你需要政府某种程度上有意义的合作。埃隆和特朗普的关系可能正在从紧张中恢复，这也不是最坏的情况。特斯拉股价在盘前也上涨了约1%。

<p class="english-text">I mean, look, that's good to see if you're a Tesla shareholder because at the end of the day, we can't forget Tesla still needs legislation over the next four years that's going to be conducive to what they're doing with self-driving and probably also conducive to what they're going to be doing with robotics. So you need some level of meaningful uh cooperation from the administration and the fact that Elon and Trump potentially are uh recovering from some of the strains in the relationship. That is also not the worst thing to see. Tesla stock right there up about 1% in the in the pre-markets as well.</p>

所以，在特斯拉的背景下看到这一点是好的。我们这里还有一些其他的更新，也可能与特朗普有关。日本新任首相，该国首位女首相之一，正考虑购买大约100辆福特F-150作为政府用车，作为特朗普访问前的一个善意举动，特朗普昨晚正在访问。特朗普在空军一号上赞扬了该计划，称F-150是一款“热门卡车”，并说这位首相对品味很好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um so good to see that in the context of Tesla. We have some other updates right here that also are potentially implicating what we've got with Trump. Japan's new prime minister, one of the first female prime ministers of the country, is considering buying around a 100 Ford F-150s for government use as a goodwill move before Trump's visit, which Trump was visiting last night. Trump praised the plan aboard Air Force One, calling the F-150 a hot truck and saying that the PM has good taste.</p>
</details>

所以你已经看到更多这些全球领导人说：“嘿，让我们想办法向特朗普示好，让我们做些能以有意义的方式促进谈判的事情。”你看到周末加拿大发生了什么。显然，他们中的一些人停止播放那则广告，然后特朗普说：“我们周六要对关税增加10%。”市场对此似乎不太在意，他们更关心中国的事情。但Bessent评论了中国，或者说评论了加拿大，基本上说他们做的事情非常愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're already getting some more of these global leaders saying, "Hey, let's find a way to warm up to Trump and let's uh do something that can create the negotiations in a meaningful way." I mean, you saw what happened with Canada over the weekend. Obviously, the some of them stopped playing the ad and uh you know, Canada essentially Trump said, "We're going to increase the tariffs by 10% on Saturday." Market kind of didn't care too much about that. They cared more about the China stuff, but Bessent commented on China and or commented on Canada and basically said they were really stupid to do what they did.</p>
</details>

他让加拿大有点屈服于相反的方向，说：“好吧，看来我们得在这里谈判了。”一个主要的贸易问题是加拿大。当然，本周，特朗普总统突然中断了与加拿大的贸易谈判，并对加拿大加征了10%的关税，以回应安大略省政府播放的一则广告。广告中出现了前总统罗纳德·里根。为什么总统会因为一则他不喜欢看的电视广告来制定贸易政策？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he got Canada kind of capitulating to the opposite direction by saying, "All right, it looks like we're going to have to negotiate here." a major trade issue which is Canada. Of course, this week, President Trump abruptly broke off trade talks with uh Canada and put another 10% tariff on Canada in response to an ad that the government of Ontario ran. It features former President Ronald Reagan. Why is the president setting trade policy based on a television ad he doesn't like?</p>
</details>

嗯，克里斯汀，让我们想想。这是一种针对美国公民的宣传。你知道，这是**心理战**（Psychological Operation）。安大略省政府为什么要这么做？我被告知，他们已经或计划花费高达7500万美元在这些跨越美国边境的广告上。那么，除了影响公众舆论之外，这还有什么目的呢？你知道，这是安大略省省长单方面发起的一种宣传。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh well, Kristen, let's let's think about this. This this is a kind of propaganda against US citizens. You know, it it's it's psyops. Why why would the government of Ontario, I'm told, that they've spent they have spent or were planning to spend up to $75 million on these ads that come across the US border. So what what was the purpose of that other other than to sway public opinion and you know it's some kind of propaganda that the premier of Ontario unilaterally launched.</p>
</details>

这10%的关税会适用于所有加拿大商品吗，部长先生？克里斯汀，自从这件不幸的事件发生以来，我一直在出差。我知道那则广告已经被撤下了。所以，我们得看看情况，但我只是觉得这位省长的判断非常非常糟糕，你知道，他有点脾气火爆的名声。总统知道这10%的关税是否会适用于所有加拿大商品吗？他对此做出决定了吗？嗯，我确定他知道，我确定格里尔大使也知道，但再次强调，我们现在在亚洲，我们正在亚洲进行这些大型贸易协议，我们今天刚签署了马来西亚协议，非常棒。而且，你知道，我过去两天一直在和中国人谈判。所以，北美那边发生什么，我认为在特朗普总统在太平洋地区的领导力面前，都是次要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Will will the 10% tariffs apply to all Canadian goods? Mr. Secretary, uh Kristen, I I've been traveling since this unfortunate event happened. I know that the ad's been taken down. So, you know, we we'll have to see, but I I just think it was ter terrible, terrible judgment by by this premier, you know, who has a bit of a reputation for being a hothead. Does the president know if the tariffs will apply to 10% tariffs will apply to all Canadian goods? Has he made a determination about that? Well, uh, well, I I'm sure he I'm sure he knows and I'm sure the ambassador Greer, uh, knows, but again, you know, we're we're here out in Asia and we're doing these big trade deals out in Asia that we just signed the Malaysian deal today, which was fantastic. And, you know, I've been spending the past two days negotiating with the Chinese. So you know what's whatever is going on back in North America I think is the taking second fiddle to President Trump's leadership out here in the Pacific.</p>
</details>

所以市场对加拿大那10%的关税不太在意。我想特朗普要么会取消它，要么会用它作为谈判的筹码。但关于这件事，我想说一点，这也是我周五说的。我认为我们从未见过一位美国总统像特朗普这样利用总统的权力。无论你喜欢还是讨厌，这是另一个问题，但我认为没有任何外交顾问会说，你应该在半夜发推文，说你要对加拿大征收10%的关税，并且所有贸易谈判都因看到一则广告而正式终止。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the markets didn't care too much about that Canada 10% tariff. I imagine Trump will either get rid of it or use it as a form of leverage and negotiation. But the one thing I will say on this and and this is what I said kind of on Friday. Um, I don't think we've ever seen a president of the United States use the leverage of being the president of the United States like we've seen Trump use it. And and whether you like it or hate it is a different question, but I don't think any diplomatic uh consultant would say in the middle of the night you should tweet that you're putting a 10% tariff on Canada and that all trade negotiations are officially terminated based on seeing an advertisement.</p>
</details>

你知道，大多数外交顾问会告诉你，“嘿，这不是正确的处理方式。”特朗普根本不在乎。无论是中国、加拿大、韩国，他想说什么就直接对民众说。他不会通过中间人，他会直接发布。全世界都会做出反应，会很混乱。然后从混乱中，当你走到另一边时，可能会有一些光明的一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? You know, most diplomatic consultants would tell you, "Hey, that's not the right way to approach it." Trump has just not cared. He's not cared whether it's China, Canada, South Korea, whatever he's going to say, he's just going to publicly say it to the people. He's not going to go through an intermediary or a middleman. He's just going to directly post it. Everyone's going to consume it. The world's going to react. It's going to be chaotic. And then from that chaos, there is potentially some bright side uh or bright line when you get to the other side.</p>
</details>

到目前为止，在某些情况下，这种做法没有奏效，但在其他情况下，它奏效了，因为你非常直接，省去了所有废话，并且利用了“哦，我们是美国”的筹码。如果你不向我们出口稀土，那我们就不想和你做任何生意。如果你要播放那些用Ascent的话来说是心理战的广告，那我们就谈完了。而另一方，因为他们需要美国，因为我们是所有东西的大消费者，最终不得不至少在一定程度上屈服。即使这不能完全解决问题，也可能让你更接近达成协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so far, in some instances, it has not worked, but in other instances, it has worked because you just go so direct and you cut through all the BS and you use the leverage of saying, "Oh, we're the United States. If you're not going to export rare earths to us, then we don't want to do business with you at all. If you're going to run these commercials that, in the words of Ascent, operate as a psyop, then we are done talking to you." And like the other side, because they need the US because we are the large consumer of everything ends up having to capitulate at least to an extent. And if it doesn't fully solve the issue, it maybe gets you closer to a deal.</p>
</details>

无论你是否喜欢这种策略，这是一种我认为美国历史上没有其他总统使用到特朗普这种程度的策略。问题是，这种策略长期来看是否会完全奏效？我们拭目以待，但到目前为止，基于这种外交的混乱程度，你确实看到了一些效果。而且，这些效果可能利大于弊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whether you like the tactic or not, it is a tactic that I don't think any other president in the history of America has used to the extent that Trump has used it. And the question is just, you know, is that going to be a tactic that fully works over the long term? We're going to see, but so far you are getting some effects based on how I guess chaotic the diplomacy is. And potentially those effects are more positive than not.</p>

### 宏观展望：季节性利好与牛市逻辑

让我们谈谈一些宏观经济。这是我们得到的情况。所以，下周之后，季节性因素开始对熊市看起来非常不利。这是基于季节性角度的标准普尔500指数。正如你所看到的，大约在十月到十一月初这段时间会有些波动。下周之后，也就是接近十一月的第一周，你开始看到一些上涨。你开始看到更多的上涨，而且这种上涨往往更具侵略性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">macro. Let's talk about some of the macro. Here's what we got. So, after next week, seasonality starts to look really bad for the bears. This is the S&P 500 index based on a seasonal uh perspective. And as you're seeing right there, this is when it's a little choppy. Around that October to early November time after next week, aka towards the next week or to towards the first week of November, you start to get some upside. You start to get a lot more upside. and that upside tends to be uh a bit more aggressive.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你在十一月和十二月看空市场，首先，如果你全年都看空，你大概只有一个机会来利用这种看空情绪，如果你有空头头寸之类的话。那就是四月。那是一个非常短暂的时刻，你必须能够抓住它。因为之后就变成了逢低买入。期间你也有一些下跌的机会，最大的一次是10月10日的3%回调。现在那次回调已经被收复，你真的要问自己，那些机会从哪里来？看起来十一月、十二月不会有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, if you are a bear going into November and December, you've got I mean, first of all, if you've been a bear all year, you've had like one option to to to kind of to to to capitalize on the bearishness if you had shorts or anything like that. And that was April. And that was a very short-term moment that you had to be able to capitalize on it. Uh because then it ended up being about the dip. And you had some dips in between that. The the biggest was the 3% draw down on October 10th. And now that that's kind of been recovered, you got to really ask yourself where are those opportunities coming? And it doesn't look like it's going to come in November, December.</p>
</details>

除非宏观经济、劳动力市场、特朗普贸易协议等方面发生非常糟糕的事情。降息可能不会成为一个因素。也许财报真的令人失望，但目前看来财报一直相当不错。那么，进入今年最后两个月的看空理由是什么？政府关门在重新开放时可能是一个利好，但即使我们继续关门，市场似乎也并不在意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unless something really bad happens in the macro, labor market, Trump trade deals, etc. Rate cuts are probably not going to play a factor into that. Maybe earnings really disappoint, but it seems like so far earnings have been pretty good. So what is the bare case going into the last two months of the year? Government shutdown potentially is a tailwind when we reopen, but even if we continue to be shut down, the markets have not seemed to care.</p>
</details>

所以，看起来在年底前确实有一些非常强劲的积极势头，而且这可能不容易放缓。除此之外，看看这个。纳斯达克指数有望连续七个月上涨。如果你看这张图表，当纳斯达克指数连续至少七个月上涨时，平均一年后，股市上涨13%，这种情况发生的概率是100%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it does look like there is some real strong positive momentum going in towards the end of the year and you know that might not be easily slowing down. On top of that, take a look at this. The NASDAQ is on track to be up seven months in a row. And if you look at this chart, when the NASDAQ is up at least seven months in a row, on average, one year later, stock market's up 13%. 100% of the time.</p>
</details>

所以，当你看到科技股像纳斯达克这样连续上涨时，这确实预示着我们长期来看可能会走高，如果财报情况继续像现在这样强劲，看起来这势头不必放缓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you have that consecutive run of tech stocks the way that the NASDAQ is running, it does signal that it likely means we are going higher over the long term and if the earnings picture continues to be as strong as it's been, it looks like that doesn't have to slow down.</p>
</details>

除此之外，我上周展示了这张图表，但作为提醒很重要，普通机构投资者的现金水平，这是基于美国银行对基金经理的一项调查，为3.8%。你有相当大比例的基金经理在减少他们的现金余额，有人可能会说这有点见顶的迹象，因为这意味着场外现金不多了。另一些人可能会说，嗯，很多资金正在被部署，很多追逐业绩的基金经理，因为他们今年表现不佳，因为他们没有有效地在某些水平上逢低买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, I showed this chart last week, but important to serve as a reminder, the cash level for the average institutional investor, this was based on a Bank of America survey of fund managers, is at 3.8%. you have a significant level of fund managers reducing their cash balance, which one could say is a little toppy because that means there's not that much cash on sidelines. Another person can say, well, a lot of that money is being deployed and a lot of the fund managers that are chasing performance because they haven't performed this year because they weren't effectively buying the dip on certain levels.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，如果你是一个基金经理，你错过了四月的下跌，然后又在10月10日错过了下跌，你肯定对自己很恼火。你可能别无选择，要么继续持有现金，接受今年业绩落后于市场的事实——这就引出了一个问题，你当初为什么要管理基金？这对很多基金经理来说是一个存在主义的问题，因为他们的业务、他们的生计都依赖于此。或者，你选择追高？如果你不得不追高，那就会造成市场融涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if you're a fund manager and you miss the dip in April and then you miss the dip again on October 10th, I mean, you really got to be annoyed at yourself and you probably have no choice but to either stay in cash and just accept that you're going to underperform the market this year, which then begs the question, why do you even manage funds in the first place? And that's a existential question for a lot of these fund managers because literally their, you know, business, their livelihood depends on it. Or do you chase? And if you have to chase, then that just creates a melt-up.</p>
</details>

而这场融涨现在又得到了降息的助力，这再次为牛市增添了更多价值。除非你认为还会有另一次下跌，也许会有，但如果我们刚刚经历了一次回调，也许就不需要再有一次3%的回调了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this melt-up is now aided with rate cuts, which again continues to to add more value to the bullcase. Unless you think there's another dip coming, which maybe there is, but if we just had a draw down, maybe you don't need to have another uh another 3% draw down.</p>
</details>

我认为这正是我昨晚写到的。我们正在向一个处于历史高位、盈利增长达到两位数的市场降息。我们刚刚经历了一次3%的回调，回调的原因是中国问题，现在看来这个问题正在消失。全球地缘政治更加和平是一个利好。俄罗斯和乌克兰可能停火也是一个利好。到目前为止，财报一直非常出色。本周我们还有很多财报要公布，希望能够延续这一势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's that's kind of what I wrote up last night as well. I mean, we are cutting rates into a market that's at all-time highs and putting up double digit earnings growth. So, we just had a 3% draw down. The reason for that draw down was because of China. That seems to be going away. More geopolitical peace around the world is a tailwind. Potential ceasefire with Russia Ukraine could be a tailwind. Earnings have been incredible so far. We got a lot of earnings coming up this week that hopefully continues it.</p>
</details>

AI资本支出没有放缓。大型科技公司产出惊人的数字，这只会强化他们为什么在资本支出上投入如此之多。场外仍有七万五千亿美元。并非所有资金都会进入股市，但即使有几千亿，记住，过去15年，货币市场基金平均有三万亿在场外。是新冠疫情额外增加了四万亿。我们不需要那四万亿都出来，但如果你有几千亿出来，对整个经济来说仍然是一个巨大的推动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI capex not slowing down. Big tech companies producing monster numbers only reinforces why they're spending so much on capex. You still have seven and a half trillion dollars on the sidelines. Not all of it's going to come into the equity markets, but even if a couple hundred billion, remember the money market funds on average for the past 15 years have had three trillion on the sidelines. COVID is what created that extra four trillion that was added to it. We don't need to have that four trillion come out, but if you have a couple hundred billion come out, that's still a massive tailwind for the broader economy.</p>
</details>

政府重新开放将是好事。然后，如果通过这次贸易协议谈判，英伟达可能很快就能向中国销售，这将是一个内部利好，对所有半导体公司来说都是一个巨大的牛市理由，因为如果英伟达能够销售更多的GPU，美光、超微电脑也会获得更多业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Government reopening will be good. And then Nvidia might have a internal tailwind by being able to sell to China soon if that is negotiated from this trade deal, which is a massive bullcase for all the semiconductor names because if Nvidia is able to sell more GPUs, Micron, SMCI, they will get more business.</p>
</details>

所以，有一些事情需要关注，比如劳动力市场。经济中肯定存在一些我们不能忽视的问题，但大趋势似乎更偏向牛市。当我们进入年底时，看到这一点非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there's things to be concerned about like the labor market. There's definitely issues out there in the economy that we can't ignore, but the broader trend just seems to be more bullish than not. And that is that is very exciting to see as we head into the end of the year.</p>

</details>

好了，打起精神来。我们开始吧。英伟达189.95美元，接近190美元，当天上涨约2%。再次提醒，这只股票的历史高点是195美元。英伟达现在是190美元。Robinhood 141美元，当天上涨3%。Palantir，哦天哪，我们非常接近突破190美元了。那将是历史新高。188.04美元。在189美元处遇到了一点阻力。如果能突破190美元，我们就会看到历史新高。

英伟达再次上涨2%。特斯拉上涨1%。标普500指数682，682.85，当天上涨。AMD在255美元，也在上涨。开盘时我们确实看到了一些红色蜡烛图，这很正常，我想我们大多数人都预料到了，因为我们在盘前市场非常火爆。现在我们要看是否有人会逢低买入。但正如你所见，AMD从258美元跌到255美元，是红色的。Grab从6.02美元跌到5.96美元，是红色的。SoFi刚刚跌破30美元。你看到这种情况在整个市场普遍发生。但我认为这没关系，因为你开始获得一些动力，买家会进场。

### 芯片行业新变局：高通发布AI芯片挑战英伟达与AMD

高通，这家以智能手机芯片建立帝国的公司，正在推出新的数据中心AI芯片，从2026年开始。他们还刚刚宣布了第一个主要客户，那就是沙特支持的AI初创公司Humane，目标是从2026年开始，容量约为200兆瓦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that built its empire on smartphones. So they're launching new data center AI chips starting in 2026. And they also just announced their first major customer. That would be Saudi backed AI startup Humane targeting roughly 200 megawatts of capacity starting in 2026.</p>
</details>

所以他们并不是直接针对AI训练，那个市场让英伟达市值超过4万亿美元。高通的目标是推理（inference），也就是运行AI模型，而不是构建它们。所以每次你使用ChatGPT或生成AI图像，那就是推理。训练构建模型，推理每天使用它们数十亿次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they're not essentially going after AI training. That's the market that made Nvidia worth over $4 trillion. Qualcomm is targeting inference. That's running AI models, not necessarily building them. So every time you use chat GPT or generate an AI image, that's inference. So training builds the models. Inference uses them billions of times a day.</p>
</details>

高通认为这个市场将是巨大的。根据麦肯锡的数据，到2030年，数据中心的支出预计将接近6万亿，几乎是7万亿美元。因此，只要占据该市场的5%到10%，甚至仅仅5%，就能改变高通的业务。他们的产品是基于其Hexagon NPU的完整服务器系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Qualcomm thinks the market is going to be enormous. Nearly 6 trillion almost 7 trillion dollars in data center spending is expected through 2030 according to McKenzie. And so just capturing about 5 to 10% maybe just even 5% of that market would transform Qualcomm's business. Their products are complete server systems based on their hexagon NPU.</p>
</details>

也就是神经处理单元芯片，已经在全球数十亿部智能手机中使用。一个关键优势，这里有点技术性，是每张卡有768GB的内存。他们说这比英伟达和AMD在这种特定的机架式设置中提供的要多。但这对于运行更大的AI模型很重要。所以这就是高通希望竞争的地方。他们将销售你现在在屏幕上看到的这些完整系统，或者也销售单个组件。高通表示，即使是英伟达或AMD也可能成为他们某些部件的客户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that'd be neural processing unit chips already used in billions of smartphones around the world. One key advantage, and this is where it gets a little technical, it's a 768 gigabytes of memory per card. They're saying that's more than what Nvidia and AMD offer in this particular uh rack type setting. That matters though for running larger AI models. And so this is where Qualcomm hopes to compete. They'll sell these complete systems that you're seeing on your screen right now for or also individual components. Qualcomm says even Nvidia or AMD could become customers for some of their parts.</p>
</details>

但时机非常重要，因为例如，OpenAI最近宣布正在从AMD购买芯片，这表明大型AI公司希望有英伟达之外的选择，尤其是在推理市场。但高通目前只点名了一个客户。没有定价细节。他们将在2026年推出，这比英伟达的主导地位晚了几年，但无可否认，这对高通来说是一个巨大的新市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the timing really matters because for example, OpenAI recently announced it's buying chips from AMD, showing big AI companies want alternatives to Nvidia, especially within the inference market. But Qualcomm only named one customer so far. There's no pricing details. They're launching in 2026, which is years behind Nvidia's dominance, but there's no taking away from the fact that this is a big new market for Qualcomm guys.</p>

是的，正如你指出的，克里斯蒂娜，潜在的竞争对手不乏其人，显然有AMD和英伟达，但也有其他公司。而且，你知道，有时我觉得我们谈论得不够多的是，Alphabet，我的意思是他们的TPU也是用于推理的，对吧？这在某种程度上让他们在每个token的成本上可能占有优势。这有点不同的话题，但对于超大规模云服务商来说，很多都归结于此。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I mean as you point out Christina no shortage of potential competitors obviously AMD and Nvidia but others as well and we you know sometimes I don't think we talk enough about the fact that Alphabet I mean their TPU is for inference as well right and gives them potentially a leg up to a certain extent this is kind of a different subject but on a cost per token basis in terms of what it costs them and a lot of this goes back to that I guess for the hyperscalers</p>

你的每个token成本会是多少？我不知道这东西会如何定价，能做什么，但这将变得很重要。

<p class="english-text">what is your you know what's the cost per token going to be I don't know where this thing's going to get priced and what it's going to be able to do but that will become important.</p>
</details>

是的。通常在芯片行业，他们称之为总拥有成本（TCO），所以高通没有提供具体细节。很多公司如何衡量它是不同的。他们说总拥有成本会更低，因为这些芯片的功耗效率更高，因为这些不是GPU，它们使用更多的电力。NPU和更多定制芯片往往使用更少的电力。所以这将是他们未来的卖点。我相信在未来几个月，他们会公布更多相关数据。但就你所说，谷歌确实脱颖而出。甚至英伟达的黄仁勋也多次谈到谷歌在TPU市场变得多么先进，他们已经在这个领域很长时间了。这家公司不是五年前才开始制造芯片的。所以，毫无疑问，那是另一家值得关注的公司。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Normally in the chip world they refer to it as total cost of ownership TCO and so Qualcomm didn't provide specific details. A lot of companies how they benchmark it is different. They're saying that the total cost of ownership will be cheaper uh because of the power efficiency of said chips because these aren't GPUs that are using a lot more power. The NPUs and more custom-made chips tend to use a lot less. So, that's going to be their selling point going forward. I'm sure in the coming months they'll reveal some more data around that. But to your point, Google really stands out. Even Jensen Wong from Nvidia has spoken many times about just how advanced Google has become in the TPU market and just they've been here for a long time. This isn't a company that just made a chip uh you know, five years ago. So, uh, that's another company to look out for. No doubt.</p>
</details>

我们怎么看？我们认为这是炒作吗？我的天，203美元。你们怎么看？我们认为这对高通来说是炒作，还是认为他们刚刚加入了与英伟达和AMD的竞争？谁能想到高通会加入这场竞赛？股价上涨20%，当天上涨31美元，给半导体投资者带来了一个完全的意外，他们可能没想到高通会与世界上最大的芯片公司竞争。

<p class="english-text">All right. What are we thinking? Do we think it's hype? Oh my goodness. 203. What do we guys think? Do we think this is hype for Qualcomm or do we think they just entered into the race with Nvidia and AMD? Dude, who would have thought Qualcomm enters the race? 20% move, $31 up on the day and completely sends a surprise to semiconductor investors that maybe didn't think Qualcomm was going to be competing with uh the biggest chip companies in the world.</p>

<p class="english-text">Okay, here we go. Uh, effulgent. Effulgent. Radiating brilliance, shining brightly, full of light or joy. Effulgent.</p>
</details>

我会说今天的股市非常effulgent。标普上涨1%，特斯拉上涨5%，Palantir上涨2%，Robinhood上涨5%，英伟达上涨3%，SoFi上涨3%，谷歌上涨2.7%。我的意思是，你真的看到了一些令人兴奋的走势。如果我们能将这种势头保持到收盘，然后进入从明天开始的财报季，那么这将是一个非常effulgent的股市，直到年底。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I would say the stock market is pretty damn effulgent today. Up 1% on the S&P. Tesla's up five. Palantir's up two. Hoodie's up five. Nvidia's up three. SoFi's up three, Google's up 2.7. I mean, you're really getting some exciting moves right here. And if we can continue this on to the end of the day and then going into earnings starting tomorrow and then this would be a very effulgent stock market for the for the end of the year.</p>
