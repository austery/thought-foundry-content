### 校园图景：混乱中的高频渗透

目前的校园氛围呈现出一种**混乱与活力并存**的状态。根据学生自发的调查显示，约 **90% 的学生**已将 AI 融入日常工作流，其用途涵盖了从总结讲座、解答习题到获取作业反馈的多元场景。然而，校方与教授的反应却极度两极分化：部分课程严厉禁止，而另一些则积极鼓励。这种规则的**灰色地带**（Gray-zone: 缺乏明确界定和指导的监管真空）让学生在享受效率提升的同时，也面临着如何合规使用工具的困惑。特别是在硅谷附近的伯克利等高校，AI 的热度极高，它已成为填补助教（TA）无法即时响应时的重要知识来源。

在商学院和研究生层面，AI 的应用则更具专业导向。学生利用它进行**市场调研**（Market Research）、分析商业案例及财务研究。但这种便利也带来了负面效应，尤其是在时间紧迫的压力下，部分学生会利用 AI 快速完成测验。这引发了深刻的反思：研究生阶段本应是培养**批判性思维**（Critical Thinking）和决策果断性的关键期，过度依赖 AI 可能会削弱这些核心能力的构建。

- I think AI and especially how students use AI, it's very telling of those motivations. You know, there are some students who are using it to complete work for them, you know, to do it on their behalf. And there are some students who, you know, are staying away from AI, or using it proactively. They're using it in ways that reinforce their learning. It's our responsibility now as students to, you know, use this tool to, you know, achieve your own individual outcomes.
- Everyone is talking about how AI is changing education, but we figured, what better way to learn about these changes than by asking actual students? My name is Greg; I'm from Anthropic, and today I'm joined by four university students who are here to give us the inside scoop.
- What are the vibes like on campus these days with AI? How are people thinking about it?
- Yeah, so I did a survey not too long ago on how students are using AI, and I saw that, you know, 90% of students are using AI in their day-to-day workflows, using it to summarize lectures, using it to answer problem sets, to help give feedback on assignments that they had written. And so, really a diverse sort of, like, use case for AI within students. It's having an impact. Universities are having to manage that. We're seeing changes in rules and regulations. We're seeing, you know, some courses ban it, other courses encourage it. And so, students are in a bit of a gray-zone right now where they may not know how to use AI.
- Yeah, I also concur. There is a lot of chaos in understanding AI and what role it'll play in universities, but at the same time, there's a lot of energy surrounding it, especially being at Berkeley and being so close to AI hype in the Bay Area. I also agree that, like, over 90%, if not basically everyone uses AI in some way or form, mostly in the form of chatbots.
- As business students, I see even myself and my colleagues, like, we use AI for a lot of different things. We use AI to understand and analyze business cases, do market research, just come up with financial research, as well. People also use AI, as well, to complete quizzes, you know, like, when you don't have time, 'cause when you're a grad student, sometimes you've got multiple jobs that you're working. So, that's the bad side of it that, when you're in grad school, you know it's supposed to be, like, a time for you to expand your critical thinking, a time for you to be someone who is, like, more decisive, someone who has, like, substance in how you make decisions.

### 角色转变：从工具使用者到构建者

AI 工具的普及正在大幅降低技术门槛，催生了一批**非技术背景的构建者**。以往只有计算机专业的学生才能涉足的领域，现在通过 **Claude Code** 等工具，即使是会计、心理学或政治学专业的学生也能熟练使用终端（Terminal）并构建完整的项目。这种转变不仅提升了学生的自信心，也改变了校园社团的运作方式——许多社团不再仅仅满足于运营社交媒体账号，而是利用 AI 开发功能丰富的官方网站。

在各种**黑客松**（Hackathons）和创新竞赛中，学生们展示了 AI 的强大潜力：
*   **Courseer 应用**: 针对热门课程名额稀缺的问题，学生开发了 AI 监控系统，一旦出现空位即刻通知。
*   **图书馆位子搜索器**: 通过扫描数据定位校园内的空闲教室，解决图书馆座无虚席的痛点。
*   **医疗健康探索**: 结合计算机视觉与 API，尝试通过摄像头识别中风迹象或情绪状态，用于心理健康辅助。

这种“构建文化”的核心在于**人类情感与洞察**。正如普林斯顿学生提到的“Vibe-a-thon”项目，获胜者往往不是技术最复杂的，而是那些能通过 AI 游戏化校园生活、引起群体共鸣的创意。在建立这种技术自信后，学生们开始思考如何将 AI 转化为个性化的“私人导师”。

- And a lot of computer science and also, like, other engineering classes, it's still kind of a taboo to use AI. I mean, in application these days, we're using a lot of, like, AI coding assistance to build actual projects outside the classroom. But in the classroom, we're still using, like, VS code and blocking out these AI features because professors, at least at the moment, are still kind of discouraging it. I think that's the number one, I guess, breakthrough with these AI tools is that the accessibility and barrier into building something, like a project or software in general, has gone down a lot.
- Yeah, I've seen that a lot at my university where students who, you know, don't typically have the confidence to go and build with, you know, raw code have now, you know, started using the terminal, for example, which is incredible to see. And, you know, Claude Code, for example, makes that so much more accessible, so much friendlier.
- I think one cool tool that my friend and I built was this place where you could basically put in your lecture slides, and it gives you sort of, like, professor annotations down the side of each slide. It kind of preempts my questions, and so I've prompted it such that it knows that I want to know the definitions of certain things on the slides.
- I think one of my favorite things that someone has built with AI is, it's an app called Courseer. What they did is they built this AI, and you can, like, just input the course that you want, and then it's gonna alert you the moment a seat is open in that class.
- My friend built this amazing tool that basically scans all of all of the data on which classrooms are free. And again, like, non-technical student building this, which is insane, unheard of.
- I've seen in the past few hackathons or entrepreneurship classes where a lot of students have been looking into, like, healthcare use cases, mixing computer vision with a Claude API to interpret a person's, like, emotions for, like, a mental health use-case.

### 动机揭示：AI 是阶梯还是拐杖？

AI 的使用方式已成为衡量学生**学习动机**的试金石。通常可以将大学目标归纳为三类：深度学习、职业铺垫、社交网络。对于那些仅追求职业或社交、对学习本身缺乏兴趣的学生，AI 往往沦为**代劳工具**（On their behalf），用于规避思考以节省时间。而对于渴望深度理解的学生，AI 则被用作**强化学习**的催化剂。这种分化揭示了一个残酷的现实：在 AI 时代，学生完全可以不学无术地混过大学，因此**个人责任感**（Individual Responsibility）变得前所未有的重要。

为了防止 AI 成为阻碍成长的“拐杖”，学生们开始强调**意图性**（Intentionality: 明确使用 AI 的目的而非盲目生成）。
1.  **从单向提问转向深度对话**: 不再是简单的“问答模式”，而是通过上传大纲和课程资料，将 AI 视为长期合作的助手。
2.  **教育模式的重构**: 伦敦政经学院（LSE）的某些课程已开始要求学生提交与 AI 的对话记录，考察其提问的质量，并以视频演讲取代传统论文，以验证学生是否真正掌握了知识。
3.  **个性化辅导**: 利用 AI 的“学习模式”（Learning Mode）进行苏格拉底式的反向提问，通过不断解释和辩论来巩固理解。

这种对学习深度的追求，正面临着来自求职市场和“AI 废料”的现实挑战。

- I think AI and especially how students use AI is very telling of those motivations. I think students, you know, you can typically group three objectives for university. The first I would say is to learn. A second objective is to position yourself for a career. And I think the third is the social element. I think AI is revealing why you're really at university, because we have the tools now to get through university without actually learning much. It's our responsibility now as students to use this tool to achieve your own individual outcomes.
- I actually agree, and I think a lot of, for how I use and approach AI is, like, intention. I like to think about am I asking it to, for example, directly complete a task for me? Or is it more of, like, something that I'm brainstorming and I'd like to think about it from different perspectives?
- University is a one-size-fits-all route at the moment. And so, AI is acting more as a personalized tutor if you prompt it in the right way. I've seen the learning mode from Claude where, you know, it's asking questions back to you. It's more of a, like, a progressive development of understanding.
- I have to say, I've seen some, like, pretty cool advancements in some of the courses at my university. They basically give you guidance on how to use Claude. They say you should have a conversation with Claude, give it a persona. And then, they ask for the conversation log because they wanna see, you know, how are you interacting with it? And then, they film a video instead of putting an essay together.

### 现实博弈：求职焦虑与 AI 废料

在步入职场的前夕，学生们感受到了 AI 带来的双重压力。一方面，AI 提升了面试练习和简历优化的效率；另一方面，企业端也在利用 AI 进行**自动化筛选**（AI Screening），导致学生在提交简历后几分钟内就会收到冰冷的拒信。这种“非人化”的招聘流程让学生感到极大的焦虑。此外，**AI 废料**（AI Slop: 泛指低质量、同质化且缺乏人类洞察的生成内容）的泛滥也让学生感到警惕。那些充满“M-dashes”破折号、语气平淡且逻辑套路的生成内容，在求职信或小组作业中极具辨识度，甚至引发了**所有权羞耻**（Ownership Shame），即学生在承认使用过 AI 时会感到不自在。

在小组合作中，这种矛盾尤为突出。
*   **“肮脏的 AI 之手”**: 部分学生对 AI 持强烈抵触情绪，担心其破坏学术纯洁性。
*   **协作策略**: 聪明的小组会先共同制定大纲，再由成员各自决定是否使用 AI 辅助，最后通过大量的**面对面交流**（Face-to-face time）来消除 AI 生成的疏离感。
*   **质量把控**: 优秀的实践者会要求 AI 扮演“评审员”角色，根据教授的评分标准对自己的初稿进行严苛打分，并多次迭代。

面对这些挑战，学生们总结出了一套在 AI 时代生存的实操准则。

- How does everyone feel about getting a job after graduation?
- Unfortunately, the downside is that also companies are obviously using AI a lot more, which involves a lot of Hirevues. I've basically been talking to a screen this entire recruiting cycle, which can feel a little less human because I don't feel like there's no chemistry.
- I agree with you, especially, like, the screening job candidates. It's so painful. You've put time together, tailored your application, and then 15 minutes later, "Sorry, we regret to inform you."
- I think, like, AI slop for me is when I receive an output from Claude or any other AI tool that I know that if I had just used my own brain, I could have come up with something better than that. It gives me a cover letter which is so generic.
- There's been a really strong sense of ownership shame that I've noticed whenever AI even gets mentioned. I think the line between of how much the human is using the AI versus how much is the AI actually just controlling the whole project is very blurry right now.
- One student was saying, like, "I'm gonna do this project before you guys get your grubby AI hands on it."
- What I like to do personally is have a lot of, like, bullet points or just, like, thought-dumping into Claude and working with it to kind of structure my thoughts. And then, one thing I really like asking Claude actually is to give the context of who is usually reviewing my work. "Hey, here are some criteria. Rate my work score out of 10."

### 策略共识：重塑个人所有权

针对如何在教育中驾驭 AI，四位学生达成了高度共识，并提出了以下核心建议：

1.  **深度学习而非表面替代**: 
    *   为每门课程建立独立的 AI 项目空间，上传所有相关资料。
    *   使用“简洁模式”快速梳理知识点，使用“学习模式”进行自我测试。
2.  **划定“工具”与“拐杖”的界限**: 
    *   **终极测试**: 如果你无法在没有 AI 的情况下，向一个五年级小学生解释清楚你所提交的内容，或者无法在 15 分钟的演示中为自己的观点辩护，那么你已经越界了。
3.  **拥抱 AI 顺应力**: 
    *   通过 Substack 等平台关注最新的 AI 工作流，保持**AI 灵敏度**（AI Fluency）。
    *   意识到 AI 可能会犯错，保持批判性眼光，确保产出物具有个人的“声音”和“温度”。

最终，学生们持有一种**“我们会解决它”**（We'll figure it out）的乐观态度。他们认为，虽然作弊和依赖现象客观存在，但随着学生对工具的熟悉，他们会逐渐意识到完全依赖 AI 的产出并不能带来真正的竞争力和成就感。大学和社会需要给学生留出探索的空间，信任他们能够通过实践找到人机协作的最佳平衡点。

- What is a tip that you have for students right now?
- Learn it. Learn how to use it. It's only to your advantage if you understand how it can optimize your career.
- If you're trying to learn new concepts, start a new project for every class. Try and paste in all the relevant files.
- My tip would be use the styles. The learning mode is fantastic. If you want to augment your own brain, use the learning mode. It will ask you questions back.
- How do you draw the line between using AI as a tool and using AI as a crutch?
- If I was in a room like this, and I can't explain or defend what I've built, even if someone asks a super critical or specific question, I think that's the line.
- I should be able to explain it like I'm explaining to someone in fifth grade.
- There have been times where I've submitted pieces which are, like, fully AI, and it's just like, this is not gonna take me anywhere at the end of the day. But you learn that. I think universities need to be conscious of the fact that students will learn, and you've gotta trust the students, right? We'll figure it out.
- This whole time, I kind of expected this conversation to shift into doomerism, and it never quite did. I think all of you are thoughtfully positive about the future.
