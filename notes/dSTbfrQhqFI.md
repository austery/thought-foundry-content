### 市场概览与英伟达的回应

大家好，欢迎回到本频道。我们再次带来每日回顾节目，今天有很多内容要讨论。英伟达（**Nvidia**）正式回应了谷歌（**Google**）的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. We've got a lot to talk about today. Nvidia officially response to Google.</p>
</details>

昨晚有一则重磅消息传出，称谷歌及其**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌开发的专用人工智能加速器）将对英伟达构成“死亡威胁”，导致英伟达股价当日下跌8%。但现在看来，这种情况可能不会发生，我们将对此进行探讨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a big story that came out last night that Google and their TPUs were now going to essentially the way the market priced that Nvidia was down 8% on the day be the death of Nvidia. That might not be happening. So, we're going to talk about that.</p>
</details>

关于12月的降息概率，我们昨天花了很多时间讨论市场如何重新定价降息预期，目前已升至约85%。今天早上我们收到了一些宏观数据，这些数据倾向于支持降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rate cut probabilities for December. We spent a lot of time yesterday talking about how the market is reperricing the idea of rate cuts have gone up to about 85%. We got some macro data this morning that is leaning in the favor of getting that rate cut.</p>
</details>

此外，标普500指数（**S&P 500**）今天上涨1%，昨天上涨1.5%。本月我们曾下跌约5%，现在已经收复了2.5%，即下跌幅度的一半。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then overall S&P 500 was up 1% today. It was up 1.5% yesterday. We were down about 5% for the month. So we've recovered 2 and a half% 50% of what we were down.</p>
</details>

我们离历史高点不远了，也许有机会达到，而且“圣诞老人行情”（Santa Claus rally）仍然可能出现。因此，我们将讨论宏观经济的现状，看看是否有机会实现这一目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are not that far away from alltime highs. Maybe there's a shot to get there and this Santa Claus rally still is possible. So we'll discuss what's going on in the macro and see if there's a chance to make that happen.</p>
</details>

感谢大家的到来，让我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you everybody for being here. Let's get into it.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达与谷歌的竞争

好的，让我们从今天最大的新闻开始，那显然是英伟达和谷歌。首先，昨天发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, let's start with the biggest story of the day, which obviously was Nvidia and Google. First of all, what happened yesterday?</p>
</details>

谷歌在某些讨论中，可能（我们尚未从谷歌或Meta得到任何确认）计划向Meta出售价值数十亿美元的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌开发的专用人工智能加速器），即其张量处理单元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google in some discussions potentially, we still don't have any confirmation on this from Google or Meta to sell billions of dollars worth of TPUs, their tensor processing units to Meta.</p>
</details>

显然，市场对此反应强烈，认为“等等，如果谷歌要向Meta出售他们的芯片，而Meta不再从英伟达购买芯片，这对英伟达来说是不是利空？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, the street took that seriously and said, "Wait a second. If if if Google is going to be selling their chips to Meta and Meta's not buying their chips from Nvidia, could that be bearish for Nvidia?"</p>
</details>

嗯，英伟达决定是时候回应今天出现的一些说法了。所以，这是英伟达的声明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Nvidia decided that it's time to respond to some of the claims that came out today. So, here is what Nvidia said.</p>
</details>

正如您在屏幕上看到的，他们表示：“我们为谷歌的成功感到高兴。他们在人工智能领域取得了巨大进步，我们将继续向谷歌供货。英伟达领先行业一代，是唯一能够运行所有AI模型并在所有计算发生的地方运行的平台。英伟达提供比**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 专用集成电路，为特定任务设计）更强大的性能、多功能性和可替代性，而ASIC是为特定的AI框架或功能设计的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As you can see right here on the screen, we're delighted by Google's success. They've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google. Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry. It's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungeibility than A6, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.</p>
</details>

今天肯定有些人对这个回应不太满意。我不是其中之一。我认为英伟达做出回应是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you definitely had some people today that were not the happiest with this response. I was not one of them. I think it was a good thing that Nvidia responded.</p>
</details>

归根结底，我确实认为英伟达应该回应这类说法。然而，我能理解另一种观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the day, I do think that uh Nvidia should be responding to these types of claims. However, I can understand the the the counter perspective.</p>
</details>

那么，这种反驳的观点是什么呢？第一个论点是英伟达昨天已经回应了**Michael Bur**（知名投资者Michael Burry，此处原文为Michael Bur）。他们向卖方分析师（**Sell-side analysts**: 为投资银行或经纪公司工作，向客户提供研究报告和投资建议）发出了一份备忘录，解释了为什么英伟达不是下一个**安然**（Enron: 美国历史上著名的能源交易公司，因会计丑闻破产），以及为什么折旧说法毫无意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what's that counter perspective? The first argument is that Nvidia already responded to Michael Bur yesterday. They sent a memo out to the sellside analysts about why Nvidia is not the next Enron and why the depreciation claims don't make any sense.</p>
</details>

所以很多人已经在说，为什么英伟达，一家价值4万亿美元的公司，要花时间回应这个Michael Bur？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, a lot of people already were saying, well, why is Nvidia, you know, $4 trillion company? Why are they spending their time responding to this Michael Bur guy?</p>
</details>

然后今天，谷歌并没有出来说什么。谷歌没有说“我们要干掉英伟达”。谷歌只是可能要出售他们的TPU。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then today, you know, Google didn't come out and say anything. Google's not saying, you know, we're going to kill Nvidia. Google's just potentially going to sell their TPUs.</p>
</details>

英伟达再次发布公开声明，回应投资者对AI交易开始感到有些紧张和担忧的事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And once again, Nvidia is putting out a public statement to respond to the fact that investors are starting to get a little bit more nervous and worried about what's going on with this AI trade.</p>
</details>

这是我的看法。第一，我认为**Jensen Huang**（英伟达CEO）捍卫自己的公司是可以的。毕竟，Jensen是一家万亿美元公司的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's my perspective on it. Number one, I think it's okay for Jensen to defend his company. I mean, at the end of the day, Jensen is a company of a multi- he's a CEO of a multi- trillion dollar company.</p>
</details>

他明白，就像上周泄露的备忘录所说，他正处于一种**第二十二条军规**（Catch-22: 指一种无法摆脱的困境或悖论）的境地：如果他们继续表现出色，他们就在一个由英伟达推动的AI泡沫中；如果他们表现不佳，AI泡沫就会破裂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He understands, as for the leaked memo that came out last week, that he's in a catch 22, which is that if they continue to do well, they're in an AI bubble that's being fueled by Nvidia. If they don't do well, then the AI bubble pops.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为从他的角度来看，这就像是“我们处于一个双输的局面。我们不如直接回应。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think from his perspective, it's like, we're in a lose-lose situation. We might as well just respond.</p>
</details>

发布回应所带来的公众关系打击或反弹微不足道，因为归根结底，最好是让派对继续下去，而要让派对继续下去，世界就必须相信英伟达会赢，所以我们不如回应那些说我们不会赢或有更强烈担忧的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like the public PR hit or backlash that we're going to get of actually issuing a response is minuscule compared to not responding because at the end of the day it's better to keep the party going and to keep the party going. The world has to believe that Nvidia is going to win and so we might as well respond to the people that are out there that are saying that we won't win or that have more aggressive concerns.</p>
</details>

今天早上，当英伟达跌至169美元时，我没有在169美元买入，而是在170.8美元买入。我在市场开盘时买入，当时Jose也上节目了，他的观点是TPU事件对英伟达来说没什么大不了的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To me this morning when Nvidia fell to 169 which I did not buy the dip at 169 I got it at 170.8. I bought a live and market open when Jose came on the show who his opinion was also that the the TPU thing is kind of a nothing broker for Nvidia.</p>
</details>

当时它跌到了169美元。我知道很多人在聊天中买入了。如果你买了英伟达，或者你开始对英伟达的船感到有点害怕，请在评论中告诉我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um that's when it dipped to 169. I know a lot of people in the chat bought it. Let me know in the comments if if you bought Nvidia or you are you know starting to get a little bit more scared of Nvidia's boat.</p>
</details>

那感觉就像一个**Deepseek**（此处指股价大幅下跌的时刻，可能指某个特定股票或事件）时刻。虽然不像Deepseek那样下跌40%，但它在169美元停留了几分钟，在170-172美元停留了大约30分钟到一个小时，然后开始反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That felt like a Deepseek moment. Now it wasn't 40% downside like Deepseek but it stayed at 169 for a couple minutes. Stayed at 170 172 for like maybe 30 minutes to an hour and then it began rebounding.</p>
</details>

我认为这不仅仅是因为宏观论点开始趋于一致，而是人们开始问自己：“等等，我要因为谷歌可能开始销售更多**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌开发的专用人工智能加速器）就全盘否定英伟达吗？TPU只是他们生态系统内部的一种集成芯片架构。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think it's not just because the macro argument started lining up, but rather people just started asking themselves, "Wait a second, I'm going to discount everything for Nvidia, because Google might start selling more of their TPUs, which is just an integrated chip architecture inside of their ecosystem."</p>
</details>

有几个原因说明这不会是英伟达的末日。第一，最坏的情况，假设是这样，那也只是英伟达10%的收入会消失，因为谷歌将减少在英伟达芯片上的支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, there's a couple reasons why that's not going to be the death of Nvidia. Number one, worst case scenario, let's say it is, and that's 10% of Nvidia's revenue that goes away because Google is going to stop spending as much on Nvidia chips.</p>
</details>

请记住，他们仍然需要为自己的数据中心购买一些**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，广泛用于AI计算），因为他们在**GCP**（Google Cloud Platform: 谷歌的云计算服务平台）中有工作负载，提供给其他客户，这些客户为AI生态系统付费，所以他们仍然需要继续购买英伟达GPU。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">remember they still have to buy some of those chips for their data centers because they have workloads in GCP that they give to other their to their other clients that you you know pay for that AI ecosystem and so they still have to keep buying Nvidia GPUs</p>
</details>

但假设谷歌开始更多地使用自己的TPU而不是购买英伟达GPU，导致英伟达销售额下降10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but let's say 10% of Nvidia sales go down because Google starts using more of their TPUs versus buying their GPUs.</p>
</details>

好的，那还有90%的巨额收入，很可能最终会分配给英伟达。所以很难想象，即使在最坏的情况下，英伟达会因为谷歌奇迹般地停止购买所有这些GPU，而TPU取而代之，或者他们开始向英伟达的客户销售TPU，英伟达就会完蛋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, that's 90% of uh a lot of money that's probably going to have to be allocated or a lot of market share that's going to eventually be allocated to Nvidia. And so it's hard to imagine that even if at the worst case scenario, Nvidia's losing 10% of their business because Google magically stops buying all these GPUs and the TPU takes over or that they start selling TPUs to Nvidia's customers that Nvidia is screwed.</p>
</details>

围绕**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 专用集成电路，为特定任务设计）的这场争论已经发生过很多次了。Jensen Huang曾多次公开评论此事，并赞扬了开发ASIC的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This debate essentially around A6 has been had many times. Jensen has public commented on it many times. Jensen has praised the companies working on AS6.</p>
</details>

但我们在那条推文中看到的评论与Jensen所说的非常相似，那就是ASIC很酷，但它们并不能解决实际问题。它们可以解决特定类型的问题，这就是它们是ASIC的原因——它们是专业化的。但在通用计算方面，英伟达变得非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the comments that we saw in that tweet are very similar to what Jensen has said, which is that AS6 are cool, but they do not solve the actual problem. they could solve a specific type of problem. That's why they're A6. They're specialized. But in terms of general purpose computing, that's where Nvidia becomes very important.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这是第一点。即使你假设谷歌将停止在英伟达上的支出，英伟达仍然有巨大的市场可以争取。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um I think that's the first thing. Even if you assumed that Google was going to stop spending on Nvidia, there would still be a massive amount of market for Nvidia to still go after.</p>
</details>

第二点是，许多客户不喜欢谷歌带来的锁定效应。谷歌TPU集成在**GCP**（Google Cloud Platform: 谷歌的云计算服务平台）中。如果客户不使用GCP，他们就无法轻易访问TPU架构，从而将其与所有工作负载和云服务集成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is that a lot of customers don't like the lockin effect that comes in with Google. Google TPUs are integrated across GCP. If a customer doesn't use GCP, they're not easily going to be able to access the TPU architecture to then be able to integrate with all their workloads and cloud services.</p>
</details>

英伟达的**CUDA**（Compute Unified Device Architecture: 英伟达开发的并行计算平台和编程模型）开发者生态系统是供应商无关的，或者我应该说它是云计算供应商无关的，因为你可以将任何英伟达芯片连接到任何云提供商。这是一个巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia with CUDA developer ecosystem, it being vendor agnostic or I should say cloud computing vendor agnostic because you can hook up any of these Nvidia chips to any of these cloud providers. That is a big plus.</p>
</details>

对于超微半导体（**AMD**）也是如此。AMD当天一度下跌9%，然后才反弹，因为围绕谷歌窃取芯片市场的同样论点开始影响英伟达和AMD。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same thing for AMD. AMD was down 9% on the day before it recovered because the same sort of argument around Google stealing the chip market started affecting Nvidia and AMD.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，归根结底，这些担忧在我看来是如此令人难以置信地平庸，用一个政治正确的说法就是“愚蠢”，以至于我认为今天的下跌是一个礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, at the end of the day, these concerns seem so unbelievably, in my opinion, intellectually mediocre, which is a politically correct way to say stupid that I think the dip was a gift today.</p>
</details>

也许下跌会更严重，也许担忧会继续恶化，但这些担忧似乎并非基于现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe that dip gets worse and, you know, maybe the concerns continue to get bad, but it doesn't seem like those concerns are rooted in reality.</p>
</details>

这是谷歌DeepMind（**Google DeepMind**: 谷歌旗下的人工智能研究公司）的研究科学家**Amir Yazdan**（负责TPU设计）今天对英伟达抛售的看法：“这次抛售表明市场对硬件和需求是多么无知。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what Amir Yazdan, who is a research scientist at Google DeepMind, who works on TPU design, said about the Nvidia sell-off today. The sell-off shows how clueless the market is about hardware and the demand.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，你真的有一个谷歌DeepMind的研究科学家，一个从事TPU工作的人，出来说这很愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you literally have a Google DeepMind research scientist who works on TPUs coming out and saying this is stupid.</p>
</details>

今天时间线上还有很多其他人。我的意思是，有些人说这是英伟达的末日。还有很多人说，伙计，谷歌从2016年就有TPU了。市场只是现在才决定发现它并弄明白，然后他们就要抛售世界上最重要的、增长最快的公司之一，因为他们认为TPU正在接管一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you had, you know, a lot of other people on the timeline today. I mean, you had some people saying that this is the death of Nvidia. You had a lot of other people saying, dude, Google has had TPUs since 2016. like the market is just deciding to discover it and figure it out and they're going to sell off one of the most one of the world's most important companies that's growing the fastest because they think TPUs are taking over.</p>
</details>

我对此持怀疑态度。所以我买入了更多。我现在持有英伟达的全部仓位。我已经有一段时间没有加仓了。今天我在170美元加仓了更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am going to take the under on that. So, I bought more. I have a full Nvidia position. Haven't added in a while. Added more today at 170.</p>
</details>

如果它真的跌破170美元，我会再加仓。但这似乎不是最大的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If it really does get below that 170 level, I'll add more. But it doesn't seem like this is the biggest concern.</p>
</details>

我理解为什么人们对Jensen的回应感到恼火。归根结底，我认为他想捍卫自己的公司，他会做出回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I understand why people are annoyed at Jensen responding. At the end of the day, I think he wants to defend his company and he's going to issue a response.</p>
</details>

当你真正审视它时，是的，这确实可能在某些方面影响英伟达。这里肯定存在看跌的情况。但对于这只目前以明年预期收益24倍交易的股票来说，这是否是一个足够有意义的看跌情况，使其跌至15倍？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you really look at it, yes, there are some ways that this can affect a video. There's definitely a bare case here. Is it a meaningful enough bare case for this stock that is now trading at 24 times next year's earnings to go down to like 15 times that?</p>
</details>

我不这么认为。因此，我今天买入了更多英伟达股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think so. And as a result, I bought more Nvidia today.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济数据与降息预期

好的，接下来，我们有一些宏观数据。降息的可能性更高了，今天达到了85%。昨天是75%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Next up, we've got some macro data. So, the probability for a rate cut has gone higher. It reached 85% today. Yesterday was 75%.</p>
</details>

周五或周四时最低只有30%。周五它跳升了，因为一些美联储主席变得看涨。昨天又有更多的美联储主席变得看涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it was a low at 30% back on Friday and or on Thursday. On Friday it jumped up because you had some Fed presidents get bullish. Yesterday you had some more Fed presidents get bullish.</p>
</details>

今天我们得到了一些宏观数据，这些数据继续表明坏消息理论上可能是好消息，这足以促成降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we got some macro data today that continue to kind of indicate bad news could theoretically be good news and that's enough to get this rate cut.</p>
</details>

那么，我们今天收到的第一份数据是什么？来自**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing: 一家提供人力资源管理服务的公司，其报告常被用作劳动力市场指标）的首次申领失业救济人数。上周ADP报告称我们每周减少2500个工作岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what's the first piece of data we got today? Jobless claims from the ADP. So last week ADP reported we were having negative 2500 jobs per week.</p>
</details>

本周他们公布私人非农就业人数平均减少了13500人。这意味着每周失业人数增加了大约6倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This week they came out and said private payrolls fell by an average of 13,500. So about a 6x increase in terms of the amount of jobs that we are losing per week.</p>
</details>

这并不是一个巨大的增长，但无论如何，它确实是一个增长。这是劳动力市场持续走弱（不是恶化，而是走弱）的另一个原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again this is not a massive massive increase but nonetheless it is indeed an increase. And this is another reason why the labor market continues to weaken not deteriorate but weaken.</p>
</details>

这使得美联储降息的可能性更高，这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is what got the Fed probabilities to give us a higher chance of getting a rate cut, which was very important to see.</p>
</details>

除此之外，你还得到了一些**PPI**（Producer Price Index: 生产者物价指数，衡量生产者销售商品和服务的价格变化）数据。这份PPI数据实际上好于预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, you got some of the PPI data. Now, that PPI data was actually better than expected.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你看看这里，美国9月份生产者价格上涨0.3%。市场预期如此。生产者价格同比上涨2.7%。市场预期如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you take a look at this right here, US September producer prices were up.3%. Street expected that. Um, producer prices year-over-year were up 2.7. Street expected that.</p>
</details>

核心PPI上涨0.1%，市场预期0.3%。核心PPI同比上涨2.6%，市场预期2.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Core was up.1 Street expected.3. And then core on the yearly was 2.6. 6 Street expected 2.7.</p>
</details>

所以你实际上的通胀数据弱于市场预期，这是好事，因为不降息的全部担忧在于通胀上涨过快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you actually had weaker inflation prints than what the street expected, which was good because the whole concern about not getting a rate cut is that inflation is going up too much.</p>
</details>

而且劳动力市场状况恶化，这又是一个细微之处。你不能有一个糟糕的劳动力市场，因为那样的话，即使我们降息也无关紧要，因为收益无论如何都会受损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you had worse labor market conditions, which again is the nuance. You can't have a horrible labor market because then it doesn't matter if we're going to cut rates because earnings are going to suffer anyway.</p>
</details>

如果人们没有工作，他们就没有钱。所以收益会恶化。但是，如果劳动力市场正在走弱，这足以让美联储降息，这对我们所有拥有资产的人来说都是非常好的，因为更低的资本成本非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If people don't have jobs, they don't have money. So earnings are going to, you know, deteriorate. But if you have a weakening labor market and that's enough signal for the Fed to cut rates, which is really good for all of us that own assets because lower cost of capital is very important.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我发表了一篇Substack文章，题为《经济的两极分化》（**The bifurcation of the economy**）。我也会把它放在描述中。它更深入地探讨了为什么资本成本对那些靠工资过活的人如此重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">U by the way, I published a Substack article, the bifurcation of the economy. I'll put that in the description as well. Really goes deeper into why the cost of capital is so important for people that are living uh paycheck to paycheck.</p>
</details>

所以，对于我们在次级汽车贷款、学生贷款和信用卡方面看到的14年来最高水平的拖欠率，我们需要这些更低的利率来帮助经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, [snorts] for the delinquencies that we've seen at the highest levels in 14 years on subprime auto, student loans, and um credit cards, like we need these lower rates that will help the economy.</p>
</details>

现在，如果劳动力市场正式恶化，那么更低的利率将无关紧要，因为25个**基点**（Basis points: 金融领域常用单位，1个基点等于0.01%）的降息，或者说每一次增量25个基点的降息，大约需要一年时间才能对经济产生实际影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if the labor market is officially deteriorated, lower rates are not going to matter because it takes about a year for the 25 basis points or at least every incremental 25 basis points to actually make an impact on the economy.</p>
</details>

它需要大约12个月才能在系统中发挥作用。所以，我们现在必须开始降息。如果劳动力市场正在走弱，我们就有可能阻止它恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Takes about 12 months to work in the system. So, we got to start cutting now. If the labor market's weakening, we can potentially save it from deteriorating.</p>
</details>

如果它正在恶化，那就太晚了。而美联储已经迟了多次。所以，这就是试图驾驭劳动力市场现状的微妙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If it's deteriorating, we're too late. And the Fed has been late many times. So, that is the nuance of trying to navigate what's going on in the labor market.</p>
</details>

如果我们能有意义地做到这一点，那么希望我们能得到降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if we can meaningfully do that, then hopefully we'll get a rate cut.</p>
</details>

然后我们还有一份宏观数据。美国10月份预算赤字为2840亿美元，去年为2570亿美元。这是10月份的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we got one more piece of macro data right here. Uh US October budget deficit was 284 billion versus 257 last year. This is for the month of October.</p>
</details>

这增加了大约300亿美元。尽管我们的净关税收入为310亿美元，而2024年10月为70亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's an increase of about 30 billion. Uh even though our net custom receipts were 31 billion versus 7 billion in October of 2024.</p>
</details>

所以我们的关税收入增加了400%以上。然而，我们又增加了2870亿美元的赤字，比去年预期多300亿美元，因为我们的支出继续超过我们的储蓄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you had more than a 400% increase in the amount of tariff revenues that we collected. Yet, we increased the deficit by another 287 billion, 30 billion more than expected from last year because our spending continues to outpace our savings.</p>
</details>

即使有关税收入，我不知道如果我们甚至在收取了长期以来四倍多的关税后都无法管理预算，我们如何能给每个人2000美元的股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, even with the tariff revenue coming in, I don't know how we're going to give everyone a $2,000 dividend if we're not even able to manage the budget after collecting 4x more the amount of tariffs that we've ever collected in a very long time.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，讽刺的是，这是比特币的看涨理由，尽管比特币目前表现不佳。但这个政府将继续支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, nonetheless, ironically, this is the bull case for Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin's not acting like it. But, this government's going to continue to spend.</p>
</details>

我们作为投资者的工作是，无论政府是否理顺账目（很难相信任何政府都能做到），都要将资本分配给那些将从所有这些支出和利率环境中受益的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our job as investors is to allocate capital to the companies that are going to benefit from all that spending and the interest rate environment regardless of if the government has their uh books in order which is you know very hard to trust any administration is going to be able to do that</p>
</details>

但如果我们继续支出，我们不如获得更低的资本成本来进行支出，所以希望我们能继续降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if we're going to keep spending we might as well get a lower cost of capital of doing the spending so hopefully we continue to cut rates.</p>

### 人工智能对生产力的影响

好的，我们要讨论的最后一件事是几条宏观数据，我认为这些数据基于我今天整理的一些内容非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right last thing we're going to discuss is just a couple piece of macro data that I thought were important based on some of the stuff that I've been uh compiling today.</p>
</details>

首先是**Anthropic**（一家领先的人工智能安全公司）的这项研究，我认为它非常有趣。他们基本上做了一项研究，估计在人工智能时代，美国的劳动生产率增长可能提高到1.8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first thing is this study right here from Anthropic I thought was very interesting. Uh, basically they did a study that's estimating labor productivity growth in the United States could increase to 1.8% in the age of AI.</p>
</details>

这将是自2019年以来平均增长率的两倍。他们是如何做到这一点的呢？这项由AI安全公司发布的研究分析了10万次与**Claude**（Anthropic开发的一款大型语言模型聊天机器人）的真实对话，以计算该技术广泛采用后可能产生的经济影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This would be doubling the average rate since 2019. Now, how did they do this? The study published by the AI safety company analyzed 100,000 real conversations with Claude, which is their chatbot to calculate potential economic impacts as the technology achieves widespread adoption.</p>
</details>

研究发现，人工智能平均将任务完成时间缩短了80%，其中医疗助理任务的时间节省高达90%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The research found that AI reduces task completion time by 80%. On average with healthcare assistant tasks seeing time savings of up to 90%. I I mean that stuff is is is just quite incredible to see.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这简直令人难以置信。完成一项任务需要1.4小时，人工成本为55美元，才能使其成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it would take someone 1.4 hours to complete and cost $55 in human labor in order to make this a real thing.</p>
</details>

我认为今天这类研究最有趣的一点是，这是人工智能的希望，这是生产力的希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think one of the most interesting things about this type of study today is that this is the hope of AI. This is the hope of productivity.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，所有那些问“AI的投资回报率（ROI）是什么？它什么时候到来？”的人，它将体现在整体**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值）、生产力以及公司所看到的劳动力利润效率中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, everyone that's asking what's the ROI on AI, when is it going to come? It's going to come in overall GDP, productivity, and the labor um margin efficiency that companies see.</p>
</details>

现在，它也可能导致大量裁员，这是一个完全不同的问题。但如果，这仅仅是**Claude**（Anthropic开发的一款大型语言模型聊天机器人）分析了10万次对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it might lead to a lot of layoffs as well, which is a whole different question. But if and that's just 100,000 conversations that Claude is analyzing.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这些聊天机器人每月进行数亿次对话。我想你将能够获得大量关于生产力如何在这些聊天机器人中（无论是**Grock**、**Gemini**、**GPT**还是**Claude**等）汇合的统计数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, these chat bots are having hundreds of millions of conversations every month. I would imagine you're going to start to be able to get a lot of aggregate statistical data on how and where the confluence of productivity can happen within these chatbots whether it's Grock, Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.</p>
</details>

这将导致更多的数据驱动的生产力方法，远优于麦肯锡（**McKinsey**）、毕马威（**KPMG**）、德勤（**Deloitte**）或埃森哲（**Accenture**）在咨询中提出的如何提高生产力的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's just going to lead to a lot more uh I guess you can say datadriven approaches to productivity way better than what a McKenzie or a KPMG or a Deote or an Accenture could produce in terms of their consulting for how we can become more productive.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这些AI机器人非常真实，它们进行的对话也非常真实，这显然可能对整个AI交易产生重大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it seems like these AI bots are very real and the conversations they're having are very real, which obviously could be a major impact for the whole AI trade.</p>
</details>

### 散户情绪与市场趋势

**IBKR**（Interactive Brokers: 盈透证券，一家全球性的在线券商）的另一份数据，我认为今天很重要。这是IBKR上交易量最大的股票：英伟达、特斯拉（**Tesla**）、超微半导体（**AMD**）、Palantir（**Pounder**）、Meta（**Metagle**）、**TQQQ**（ProShares UltraPro QQQ: 一支三倍做多纳斯达克100指数的交易所交易基金）、**QQQ**（Invesco QQQ Trust: 一支追踪纳斯达克100指数的交易所交易基金）、谷歌和亚马逊（**Amazon**）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IBKR, another piece of data I thought was important today. These were the top traded stocks on IBKR, Nvidia, Tesla, AMD, Pounder, Metagle, TQQQ, which is triple leverage, QQQ, Google, QQQ, and then Amazon.</p>
</details>

散户投资者正在大量买入科技股。非常简单。散户正在大量买入科技股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Retail's loading up in tech. Very simple. Retail is loading up in tech.</p>
</details>

AI情绪我不想说正在回归，但至少它不像几周前那么糟糕了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The AI sentiment is I don't want to say coming back, but at least it's not I know Nvidia's still down substantially from earnings, but it's not as bad as it was a couple weeks ago.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，几周前，人们认为AI已经死了。我认为**Gemini 3**（谷歌开发的大型语言模型）的出现似乎在说：“不，我们还活得好好的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, a couple weeks ago, people just thought AI was dead. And I think Gemini 3 kind of came in and said, "No, we're very much alive."</p>
</details>

结果，你看到一些人开始涌入科技股。上周，看看这张图表。标普500指数的日均名义交易量达到了创纪录的3.5万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, you're getting some of those people to start piling up in tech. And last week, take a look at this chart right here. Um, the average daily notional trading volume in the S&P 500 hit a record 3.5 trillion.</p>
</details>

是的，人们很可能在上周逢低买入了。再次强调，这是上周，当时感觉天要塌下来了，市场一周下跌了大约4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, it's very likely that people bought the dip last week. Again, this was last week when it felt like the sky was falling and markets were down like 4% for the week.</p>
</details>

他们可能买入了看涨期权。我的意思是，如果你看看标普500指数的名义期权交易量与历史平均水平的对比，这是在**罗素2000指数**（Russell 2000: 衡量美国小型股表现的指数）市值呈红色，标普日均期权名义交易量呈蓝色的情况下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and they probably bought calls. I mean, if you're looking at the S&P 500 notional option volume versus the historical average of it, this is on top of the Russell 2000 market cap in the red and the S&P daily option notional volume in in blue.</p>
</details>

你看到创纪录的高点。更令人难以置信的是，上周交易了9500万份合约。根据**高盛**（Goldman Sachs: 一家全球领先的投资银行和金融服务公司）的数据，这是历史上最高的交易量之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're seeing a record high. And what's also really really incredible about this is that 95 million contracts were traded last week. It was one of the highest in history as per Goldman Sachs.</p>
</details>

过去一年，每天交易的所有期权美元价值翻了一番，自2020年以来飙升了8倍以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dollar value of all the options traded each day has doubled over the last year and has surged over 8x since 2020.</p>
</details>

同样非常重要的是，这可能表明“逢低买入”的心态又回来了。我不想说我们已经完全摆脱困境，每次下跌你都能立即买入并获得回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's also really important about this is that it goes to potentially say the sort of buy the dip mentality is back. I'm I don't want to say it's, you know, we're completely out of the woods and then every dip you immediately buy and you get rewarded.</p>
</details>

显然，考虑到收益增长如此之好，这是一个长期牛市，所有这些趋势，量化宽松即将到来等等，这些都是逢低买入应该得到回报的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, there is some logic to that given the earnings growth is so good and it's this secular bull market. There's all these trends, quantitative easing is coming up, etc., etc. for why buying the dip should be rewarded.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，在过去一个月里，几乎每次逢低买入都感觉像是在接飞刀。如果这种情况改变，逢低买入的心态回归，并且这让人们感到非常兴奋，我们上周在期权交易量方面也看到了这一点，也许这也会是年底前的看涨因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless, over the past month, it almost felt like every time you bought the dip, you bought a falling knife. If that changes and buying the dip is back and that becomes something that's very exciting to people and we kind of saw it last week in regards to the amount of options that were traded, maybe that also is going to be something bullish going into the end of the year.</p>
</details>

### 经济两极分化与消费支出

最后一张图表我想和大家分享，回到经济两极分化的论点。美国家庭总收入超过15万美元的比例有所增加，而中产阶级却在萎缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Final chart I want to share with everybody going back to this bifurcation of the economy argument. The percentage of US households with a total income greater than 150,000 has increased as the middle class has been shrinking.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这项分析非常重要。经通胀调整后，收入超过15万美元的美国家庭现在占所有家庭的创纪录的34%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I thought this analysis was really important. US households with incomes greater than 150,000 adjusted for inflation now make up a record 34% of all households.</p>
</details>

这比1965年增加了29个百分点。与此同时，中产阶级萎缩了11个百分点，降至45%，创历史新低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is up 29 percentage points since 1965. At the same time, the middle class has shrunk 11 percentage points to 45%, the lowest on record.</p>
</details>

一个四口之家的基本家庭预算生活成本现在在13万到15万美元之间。这再次证明了贫富差距正在持续扩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">living costs for a basic family of four budget are now between 130,000 and 150,000. Once again, it goes to prove the argument that the wealth gap is continuing to broaden.</p>
</details>

对此，除了机构或政客的政治结构能够拯救我们之外，我的解决方案是加入所有权阶层。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And kind of my solution to this outside of the political structure of institutions or politicians that could save us is joining the ownership class.</p>
</details>

而且，你知道，加入所有权阶层的人越多，他们获得的利益就越多。但我们显然看到经济正在更广泛地两极分化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Um, and you know, the more people that join the ownership class, the more benefit they've had. But we are clearly seeing a broader bifurcation of the economy.</p>
</details>

现在，我要说一件事来反驳我今天关于经济两极分化论点的说法。**XRT**（SPDR S&P Retail ETF: 一支追踪美国零售业表现的交易所交易基金），即零售商**ETF**（Exchange Traded Fund: 交易所交易基金），创下了自5月以来的最佳表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one thing I will say to kind of push back against what I'm saying today around this whole bifurcation of the economy argument. XRT, which is the uh retailer uh um ETF, had its best day since May.</p>
</details>

百思买（**Best Buy**）、Burlington（**Burlington**）、Coofactory（**Coofactory**）、Atrombi（**Atrombi**）当天上涨40%，科尔士（**Kohl's**）上涨40%。然后，Urban Outfitters（**Urban Outfitters**）上涨20%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Best Buy, Burlington, Coofactory, Atrombi was up 40% on the day. Kohl's was up 40%. Um and then after I was Urban Outfitters was up 20%.</p>
</details>

我不知道这是否是年底需求提前释放。每个人都认为人们会继续在衣服或其他商品上消费，但我觉得消费者正在走弱，我们有很多数据表明消费者正在走弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if this is like a pulling forward of demand going into the end of the year. And everyone thinks that like people are just going to keep spending on clothes or stuff, but like I thought the consumer was weakening and we have plenty of data to say the consumer is weakening.</p>
</details>

但如果他们在Urban Outfitters消费，或者从Abberrombi购买75美元的牛仔裤，甚至百思买今天也有不错的收益。所有这些股票都得到了市场的青睐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if they're spending at Urban Outfitters or buying $75 jeans from Abberrombi, even Best Buy had decent earnings today. You had all these stocks just really get some love.</p>
</details>

Chipotle（**Chipotle**）上涨7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chipotle was up 7%.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，也许我们看到数据中出现了一些反趋势，表明消费者并没有走弱。如果我们获得降息，劳动力市场没有那么糟糕，消费者没有走弱，而且AI交易活跃，那么我认为我们将把这个牛市延续到明年，甚至可能到明年年底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, maybe we're seeing some counter trends in the data that the consumer is not weakening. And if we get rate cuts, the labor market's not that bad, and the consumer is not weakening, and this AI trade is well and alive, I think we continue this bull market into next year, potentially towards the end of the year as well, and maybe that's how the year could end up playing out.</p>
</details>

### 总结与展望

好了，我的分享就到这里。感谢大家的收听和观看。我们明天将进行本周的最后一次每日回顾。
