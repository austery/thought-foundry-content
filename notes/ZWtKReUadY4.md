### 浪漫的定义

**安娜·马丁**: 只要有爱，你就会坠入爱河。那种比任何事物都强烈的爱。为了爱而爱。我也爱你，胜过一切。爱依然存在。这里是来自**《纽约时报》**的**安娜·马丁**。欢迎收听**《现代爱情》(Modern Love)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Love now and you fall in love. Love that was stronger than anything. For the love of love. And I love you more than anything. There's still love. From the New York Times. I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love.

</details>

**安娜·马丁**: 过去一个月里，我们一直在征集你们经历过最浪漫的事。这都是因为本周是**情人节**。情人节快乐！除了浪漫，情人节还能关乎什么呢？但我一直在想，浪漫对人们到底意味着什么？它在我们的生活中究竟是如何体现的？什么样的浪漫举动能让你在多年后依然津津乐道？我们收到了非常多回复，我真希望全都能放出来。虽然不能全部播出，但我们确实听了每一条留言。今天，我们将听到其中的一些故事，然后，我将与“情人节国王和王后”本人进行对话。现在，请坐好，放松，让浪漫席卷你的全身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: So, for the past month, we've been asking you to send us the most romantic things that have ever happened to you. All because it's Valentine's Day this week. Happy Valentine's Day. And what is Valentine's Day about but romance? But I've been wondering like, what does romance really mean to people? How does it actually show up in our lives? What's the kind of romantic gesture you keep talking about years later? We got so many responses from all of you, and I feel like I'm always saying this, but I wish we could play them all. We did listen to every single one, though. Today, we are going to hear some of your stories, and then, my friends, I'm speaking with the Queen and King of Valentine's themselves. All right, sit back, relax, and let the romance wash over you.

### 细微处的深情

**[听众A]**: 我生命中最浪漫的时刻发生在2025年2月14日，也就是三个月前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener A]**: My most romantic experience occurred on February 14th, 2025, Valentine's Day, only 3 months ago.

</details>

**[听众B]**: 那是在2024年12月16日，我遇到了现在的妻子。当时我住在纽约市，而他在夏威夷驻扎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener B]**: It was actually December 16th, 2024 when I met my now wife. I lived in New York City. He was stationed in Hawaii.

</details>

**[听众C]**: 当时我们刚开始交往几个月。有一次大中午，我们站在街角等红绿灯。他看着我，吻了我。与此同时，一辆经典的**有轨电车**经过。车尾的一个男人看到我们接吻，他像**《雨中曲》**里那样探出身子，向我们挥手大喊：“他爱你！他真的真的很爱你！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener C]**: I was in the first few months of a relationship. We were standing on a street corner at one point in the middle of the day waiting to cross the street. He looked over at me. He kissed me. And meanwhile, one of those classic trolley cars was riding by. And this one man who was on the back of the train saw us kiss and he leaned out like he was like in Singing in the Rain and waved at us and he shouted, "He loves you. He really really loves you."

</details>

**[听众D]**: 我丈夫在结婚前很久就带我开始跑步。我们结婚38年后他去世了。他一直非常鼓励我，是我最大的拉拉队队长。他会给我写便条，每次跑完马拉松，他总是我第一个打电话的人。但他做过最棒、最浪漫的事是，每天晚上我们坐在沙发上时，他都会让我把脚放在他的腿上——我那双因为跑步而变得粗糙、难看的脚——然后他会帮我**按摩**。那是如此温柔而浪漫的举动，我永远不会忘记。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener D]**: My husband introduced me to running long before we were married and we were married for 38 years when he passed away. He encouraged me so much. He was my biggest cheerleader. He'd write me notes, always be the first person I'd call after a marathon. But the thing that he did that was the best and most romantic thing was that every night when we'd sit on the couch, he would ask me to put my feet into his lap, my gnarly, ugly, running feet, and he would rub them. It was such a tender and romantic gesture. I'll never forget it.

</details>

**[听众E]**: 我们的第一次约会在一家爵士酒吧。约会期间我点了一份 **枣泥饼 (Ma'amoul)**，那是我最喜欢的饼干之一。第二次约会时，他从口袋里掏出一样东西说要给我个惊喜。他手心里是一块包装好的枣泥饼，因为他记得我在第一次约会时说过喜欢它。我觉得这非常贴心。到了第三次、第四次、第五次约会，他依然会从夹克口袋里掏出枣泥饼。他成箱地买回来，确保每次约会开始时都能给我一块。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener E]**: Our first date was at a jazz bar. Sometime into the date I made a second order of a mamu which is a date cookie. It's one of my favorite cookies. On our second date, we meet up and he pulls something out of his pocket and says he has a surprise for me. And in his palm is a wrapped mamu cookie because he remembered that I said that I liked it on our first date. On our third date, the same thing happened. On our fourth date, our fifth date, our sixth date, he continued to have mamul cookies that he bought in bulk and made sure to always have one to give me every time we started our date.

</details>

**[听众F]**: 我的故事并不宏大，甚至很微小。我的左耳部分失聪，如果在嘈杂的环境里，我会感到非常孤立和沮丧。我的伴侣和我在一起四年了，每次我们出去吃饭，他总是第一个冲到桌子旁，确保我坐的位置能最清楚地听到大家的谈话。他做这些从不需要我开口。每当我想起他是在努力让我尽可能感到舒适和融入时，我都会露出微笑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener F]**: Mine's not very grand. I am partially deaf in my left ear. If I'm in a space with a lot of noise, I can barely hear a thing. That can lead me to feeling quite isolated and frustrated. Well, my partner who I've been with for about four years now, anytime we're out somewhere, he is the first one to the table, and he always makes sure that I have a seat at the place where I could best hear the entirety of the group. He does this without me asking him to. And that just makes me smile every time he does it.

</details>

### 默契与接纳

**[听众G]**: 有一次半夜我热醒了，挣扎着想脱掉卫衣，又怕把里面的T恤也带出来。我丈夫在睡梦中似乎察觉到了，他默默地伸过手，帮我拽住T恤的下摆，让我能轻松脱掉卫衣。他拍了拍我的背，翻身又睡着了。第二天早上醒来，我觉得能和这样一个即便在熟睡中也能注意到你的挣扎并伸出援手的人在一起，真是太幸运了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener G]**: Halfway through the night, I woke up very warm. I sat up and I was really struggling to get my sweatshirt off without it taking my t-shirt with it. Kind of out of nowhere and silently he reached over and I felt his hand kind of grasp the lower part of my t-shirt and I was able to then easily take off my sweatshirt. He gave my back a little pat and then he rolled over and fell back asleep. When I woke up the next morning, I just thought, "God, that's so nice to have someone who's notice that you're struggling and just kind of lend a hand."

</details>

**[听众H]**: 我有一个很尴尬的迷信：睡觉前必须**敲木头**。搬去和男友约翰同住时，我很怕被他发现。有一天他还是撞见了。他听我解释说去露营或出差时找不到木头敲会很困扰。他沉默了一会儿说：“我能为你做一个**敲门木块**吗？这样你随身带着它去任何地方都可以。”这让我感觉到，即使是你身上最不起眼的部分也是被接纳的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener H]**: I have this thing that's really embarrassing. I am superstitious and I have to knock on wood before bed. When I moved in with my boyfriend John, I was nervous he would catch me. And one day he did catch me. He listened as I told him about how it's hard when we go camping or I am traveling for work and there is no wood to knock on nearby. He lay silently for a while and then said, "Can I make you a knocking block so you can take it with you anywhere?" It showed me what it feels like when even the least impressive parts of you are welcome.

</details>

**[听众I]**: 很久以前，我对身上的雀斑感到很自卑。我当时的男朋友跪在垫子上，用手指慢慢勾勒我腿上的深色雀斑。他说：“也许如果我们把这些点连接起来，最终就能找到所有的**星座**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener I]**: A long time ago I had my first boyfriend. I explained that I felt self-conscious about all the spots. He was quiet as he kneled on the floor beside me and he slowly traced the dark freckles on my legs with his finger. Maybe if we connected the dots, he said, eventually we could find all the constellations.

</details>

### 陌生人的善意

**[听众J]**: 我们当时是两个穷学生，想庆祝情人节，于是去了一家超出预算的高级餐厅。邻桌坐着两位老太太，她们离开时向我们挥手告别。买单时，服务员说她们已经帮我们付了钱。她们想让我们知道，**爱无处不在**。有时我们认为浪漫只是两个人的事，但有时浪漫也存在于社区和周围人的微小善举中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Listener J]**: The two of us were very broke college students and wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day and we found a very fancy nice restaurant. There were these two elderly women kind of a few tables down from us. When it came time for us to get the check, the server had said that our dinner was actually covered by those ladies. They wanted to let us know that love is all around. I think sometimes romance can be found so deeply in community as well and the small actions by the people around us.

</details>

### 情人节之王

**安娜·马丁**: 感谢大家的分享。有一位听众写信告诉我们，有一对夫妇总是公开展示他们的浪漫。在过去的30年里，**朗尼·安德森 (Lonnie Anderson)** 一直在为他的妻子**安·布勒·威瑟斯彭 (Ann Buler Witherspoon)** 制作宏大、夸张的情人节惊喜。他因此变得小有名气。欢迎朗尼和安来到《现代爱情》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: The stories you all sent us, they were so lovely to listen to. So, thank you again. We did have one person write in though to tell us about a couple who does their romantic gestures very publicly. For the past 30 years, Lonnie Anderson has been making these huge over-the-top Valentines for his wife Anne Buler Witherspoon. Ann Bulger Witherspoon, Lonnie Anderson, welcome to Modern Love.

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 你好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: Hello.

</details>

**安娜·马丁**: 朗尼，很多人称你为“情人节之王”。这30年来你都做了些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Lonnie, you have been called by many people the king of Valentine's Day. What is this tradition?

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 我不觉得自己是国王。但我确实深爱我的妻子。这30年来，我一直尝试为她构思创意十足的情人节礼物。比如，我让**国家天文馆**重新编写了圆顶程序，让星空中显示出“我爱安”。我还把她所有朋友制作的情人节贺卡投影在阿尔伯克基市中心的一座20层高的建筑上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: Well, I don't know if I would say I'm the king. But yeah, I love my wife very dearly and for 30 years I have tried to come up with, you know, a creative and wonderful Valentine for her. We had the National Planetarium reprogram the dome so that it says I love an in the stars. I projected all the Valentine's downtown in Albuquerque on a giant building like a 20s story building.

</details>

**安·布勒·威瑟斯彭**: 还有一年，朗尼在我回家的路上设置了各种“我爱安”的牌子。他把社区里能看到的各种标牌——比如折扣店门口的那种——都换成了告白。最后以社区里的一幅巨大的“我爱安”**壁画**结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Buler Witherspoon**: So along the same theme, one year Lonnie kind of put various I love an signs on my drive home. Anything that like all the signage you see around your neighborhood said I love I just I just switched out and it ended with a a large I love an mural in the neighborhood.

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 我还请过阿尔伯克基最著名的厨师来家里做饭，让我们的女儿当领班。还有一次，在一家历史悠久的剧院，只有我和安两个观众，交响乐团专门为她演奏了一曲。我还做过一个巨大的**麦田怪圈**，那是一个50英尺宽的心形，中间写着她的名字，从太空中都能看到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: You've also turned the house into a restaurant. We had what the most famous chef in Albuquerque come and do it. Another thing we did is in this big historic theater just me and an, they played one song for an and we were the only two people in the audience. I made a giant crop circle. So I did a giant heart with her name. It was the size of this huge field. It can only be seen from space.

</details>

### 从私人到社区

**安娜·马丁**: 这一切是怎么开始的？安，告诉我朗尼送给你的第一个情人节礼物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I have to know like how did this start? An tell me the story of the first Valentine Lonnie ever gave you.

</details>

**安·布勒·威瑟斯彭**: 当时我们刚开始约会不到一年，还在异地恋。他把我的客厅变成了一个巨大的**游戏棋盘**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Buler Witherspoon**: So we had just started dating. He was living in Portland and I was living in Albuquerque. He had converted the living room into a game board.

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 我做了巨大的骰子。你掷骰子，落在不同的格子上会有不同的活动，比如吃块巧克力、喝杯香槟，或者“告诉我一件我不知道的关于你的事”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: I made these giant dice. You would roll the dye and as you moved through the game board there would be various questions or various activities like have a piece of chocolate pour a glass of champagne, tell me something that I don't know about you.

</details>

**安·布勒·威瑟斯彭**: 那是磨合期的开始。当时我有点怀疑：这家伙是不是在显摆？这种劲头什么时候会过去？但一年又一年，他坚持了下来。我意识到这不仅仅是为了追求我，他背后真的有一种热情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Buler Witherspoon**: So there's discovery to be had. I think the first inclination of like, oh well, this is a little bit of a over-the-top and when is it going to putter out, right? And it did and then the next year. What became apparent in all of that is that it wasn't just to hook me, it really there is a passion behind it.

</details>

**安娜·马丁**: 朗尼，为什么一开始就搞得这么大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Lonnie, why go that big, that hard that soon?

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 很简单，因为爱。当你坠入爱河时，你会做疯狂的事。我无法控制安有多爱我，但我可以控制我有多爱她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: I mean, it's simple. It's love. When you're in love, what do you do? You do crazy stuff because you're so over the top. I'm not in charge of how much Ann loves me, but I am in charge of that I love her.

</details>

### 今年的甜蜜惊喜

**安娜·马丁**: 随着规模越来越大，这些举动也变得越来越公开。安，这种转变对你来说难吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Buler Witherspoon**: Anna, as these Valentine have gotten bigger and bigger they've also gotten more and more public. Was that transition hard?

</details>

**安·布勒·威瑟斯彭**: 我比他内敛得多。但后来我意识到，这已经不仅仅关乎我了。这成了朗尼送给社区的一份礼物，也是我回馈给朗尼的礼物。我接受了它从私密走向宏大和包容的过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Buler Witherspoon**: I'm probably a much more private person than him. And then there came a point where I really sort of said this isn't about Ann anymore. This is a gift I can give back to Lonnie and that it's larger than myself now. I'm okay with the idea that it has moved from the more quiet intimate towards larger and more inclusive and grander.

</details>

**安娜·马丁**: 最后一个问题，今年的情人节打算怎么过？为了不给安剧透，安，你能先离开房间一秒钟吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: My final question, obviously I'm dying to know what the heck this year's Valentine's Day is. Can you leave the room for like one second?

</details>

**朗尼·安德森**: 好的。今年我正和一位在非营利艺术工作室工作的好朋友合作。我们不打算送她一盒糖果，我们要送她**一间糖果店**。那是一家有百年历史的糖果店。我们用成千上万颗**糖豆**制作了一个巨大的招牌挂在橱窗里，上面写着“安”。糖果店还同意为她制作定制的糖果盒。所有参与制作的人都会把他们所爱之人的名字写在小红心上。整个社区都在帮我给安送出这间糖果店。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lonnie Anderson**: So this year instead of giving her a box of candy, we are going to give her an entire candy store. There's this historic over 100-year-old candy store. They made this giant sign for the front of this candy store that's made out of jelly beans. Thousands of jelly beans and then it says Ann. And then the candy stores agreed to make custom candies for her. And then all of these people that helped with the chili beans, they all put the person that they love their name on a little heart. They're going to give her an entire candy store.

</details>

**安娜·马丁**: 哇，朗尼。祝大家情人节快乐。感谢收听《现代爱情》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wow, Lonnie. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. Thanks for listening.
