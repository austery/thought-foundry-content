title: 加密货币的无限金钱漏洞已失效：从疯狂投机到金融现实的崩塌
---

### 加密货币财库公司的疯狂循环：从AI表情包到金融幻觉

加密货币的“无限金钱漏洞”似乎已经失效——我们或许永远无法真正知道究竟哪里出了问题。这套机制原本是这样运作的：你找一家无关紧要的公司，筹集资金购买比特币——或者任何其他代币（它们本质上都一样）——然后在社交媒体上发布一些近乎宗教式的言论，宣称货币的未来，并投入大量精力制作AI表情包。因为如今在企业金融教科书里已经公认：高质量的AI表情包确实能推高代币价格。这启动了一个飞轮效应：加密货币价格上涨 → 推动公司股价上升 → 你再发行更多股票融资 → 买入更多加密货币 → 如此循环往复。如果有人质疑现金流、市盈率，甚至热力学基本定律——那可能只是提醒你：该多做点AI表情包了。既然经营一家真正的企业如此枯燥、容易出错，为什么不去买点东西、发个推文、然后拉升它的价格呢？

<p class="english-text">The crypto infinite money glitch appears to be broken – and we may never truly know what went wrong. The way it was supposed to work is that you take an irrelevant company, raise capital to buy Bitcoin – or some other token (they are all the same) – then tweet something quasi-religious about the future of money and put a lot of effort into creating AI memes – as good AI memes will definitely drive the token price up – I mean that’s in corporate finance textbooks at this point… This starts the flywheel spinning: The crypto goes up – pushing your stock price up, you then sell more stock to raise money - buy more crypto, rinse and repeat. If there are any annoying questions about cash flow, P/E ratios, or the fundamental laws of thermodynamics – that is possibly just a sign that you need to crank out more AI memes. Why run a business – which is dull and boring and can go wrong in so many ways - when you can just buy something tweet about it and pump its price?</p>
</details>

这种模式的真正创新，是将公司股价的波动性货币化。如果你的股价像一只咖啡因上瘾的松鼠一样剧烈跳动——用极客的话说，就是具有很高的标准差——你就可以通过发行低息或零息可转换债券来变现这种波动性。股价越不稳定，嵌入的转股权价值就越高，对冲基金就会购买这些可转换债券——他们未必相信你的公司或你声称驱动其价值的柴犬币，但他们可以通过伽马交易（gamma trading）赚钱——我稍后会详细解释：这涉及买入可转换债券，同时按比例做空对应的股票，使你的整体头寸保持市场中性，并随着股价波动不断调整仓位规模。这些对冲基金根本不关心你的公司或柴犬币的价值，他们只在乎股价是否剧烈波动——而这正是你那些AI表情包和疯癫推文所要制造的效果。这形成了一个良性循环——好吧，至少是个循环——它让曾经失败公司的CEO能以低廉成本筹集资金购买愚蠢的代币，同时为对冲基金提供了有利可图、市场中性的交易机会。

<p class="english-text">Look – you can be as negative about this as you want to be – I know you guys can be judgmental - but it worked like a cheat code in a video game where companies could raise funds to buy crypto - that buying drove up the token prices; the firms stock price often went up even more than the crypto did – as idiots would buy the stock. Your quasi-religious tweets and memes to stir up your followers on the everything app were good for social media platforms and provided a real use case for Sora too – This was hype capitalism at its best. Whether you like it or not – it’s just how things work - it’s maybe even how things should work – as why have a company that does something - when you could just have a company that buys something and pumps its price up. It’s better… It’s more efficient… Over the last year, crypto treasury companies revolutionized the way business worked. And while it started with Microstrategy and Bitcoin – managers of other irrelevant companies worked out that you could stuff pretty much anything into this structure. As if you think about it – everything can be scarce if you raise enough money to buy all of it… The way I see it is that business has just been too complicated for too long – the guy with the high-pitched voice and the bitcoins - worked out that businesses - if you separate them from business activity can be much more efficient. Elon Musk – who spent billions of dollars on AI so that he could have a cartoon girlfriend says that most jobs will eventually become “optional,” comparable to hobbies like playing sports or gardening. He explained at a U.S. - Saudi Investment Forum that this can all happen as long as we create an AI that cares deeply about truth and beauty – and – you’re just not going to find a group that cares more about truth and beauty than the people attending an Elon Musk speech at a US Saudi investment forum.</p>

### 模仿者的陨落与GameStop的清醒

在过去一年中，加密货币财库公司彻底改变了商业运作方式。尽管它始于MicroStrategy和比特币，但其他无关紧要的公司也发现，几乎任何东西都能塞进这个结构里。因为如果你仔细想想——只要你筹集足够的钱去买下所有的东西，那么任何东西都能变得稀缺。在我看来，商业长期以来太过复杂了——那个高音调、拿着比特币的男人发现：如果把企业与其经营活动剥离，它们可以变得高效得多。埃隆·马斯克曾说，在他投入数十亿美元开发AI以拥有一个卡通女友之后，大多数工作最终都会变得“可选”，如同打网球或园艺一样。他在美沙投资论坛上解释说，只要我们创造出一个真正关心真理与美的AI，这一切都能实现——但你很难找到比参加埃隆·马斯克在美沙投资论坛演讲的这群人更关心真理与美的群体了。

<p class="english-text">In this brave new world – where everyone is living large and no one is working – we going to need our infinite money glitches to keep it all afloat. But… The problem now - is that the cheat code seems to have stopped working. Strategy - is no longer trading on animal spirits; it’s been dragged down by financial gravity. Since the company went all-in on bitcoin, it has hardly any other sources of revenue, and it now owes $800 million dollars a year in dividends and debt-interest payments. The massive premium to Net Asset Value - which was the magic dust that made the share issuance accretive - has evaporated to a pedestrian 1.15 times – worse than that - some of the copycat firms are now even trading at a discount to their crypto NAVs.</p>
</details>

在这一片模仿者的坟墓中，却有一个荒诞的例外：GameStop。当这位最初的“迷因股之王”宣布转向比特币财库策略时，其股价反而下跌了10%。为什么会这样？因为与Strategy不同，GameStop拥有真正的业务——它在购物中心向人们销售电子游戏和Funko Pop手办，而这些顾客并不全是GameStop的股东。市场意识到：如果你拥有真实的收入和真实客户，你就会被这些基本面所评判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But amidst this graveyard of copycats, there was one hilarious exception: GameStop. When the original meme-stock king announced it was pivoting to a Bitcoin treasury, the stock actually fell 10%. Why did this happen?? Well, because unlike Strategy, GameStop has an actual business. It sells video games and Funko Pops to people in shopping malls – not all of whom are also GameStop shareholders. The market realized that if you have real revenue and real customers, you are judged on them.</p>
</details>

### “无限金钱漏洞”的核心：NAV溢价幻觉

要理解Strategy的崩塌，你必须了解驱动这场狂热的荒谬算术。整个“Strategy”交易依赖于一个单一、脆弱的变量：**溢价（premium）**。在2024和2025年的大部分时间里，投资者愿意为Strategy资产负债表上每一美元的比特币支付约两美元。为什么？因为Strategy提供了一种别处无法获得的东西：**无追加保证金的杠杆（leverage without the margin call）**。如果你在交易所做多比特币并遭遇价格暴跌，你会被平仓；但如果你买入Strategy股票，你虽然仍会遭受巨大损失，却可以继续持有头寸并等待反弹。去年夏天我曾发布过一篇关于加密货币财库公司的视频，评论区里Strategy的拥趸们争论说，这家公司有价值，应该享有溢价，因为投资者无法轻易获得对比特币的杠杆敞口——但即使那时，已有超过100家公司做着完全相同的事，其中许多还以更低的溢价进行交易。为一美元的比特币支付两美元，这根本说不通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To understand the Strategy collapse - you have to understand the bizarre arithmetic that drove the boom. The entire "Strategy" trade relied on a single, fragile variable: the premium. For most of 2024 and 2025, investors were willing to pay around two dollars for every one dollar of Bitcoin on Strategy’s balance sheet. Why? Because Strategy offered something you couldn’t get elsewhere: leverage without the margin call. If you took a leveraged position in Bitcoin on an exchange and the price crashed, you got liquidated. If you bought Strategy stock, you got loads of bitcoin exposure but if it tanked - you still had a huge loss – but you could hold on to your position and hope for a bounce. I made a video about crypto treasury companies last summer and in the comments section, Strategy cheerleaders were arguing that the business was valuable and should trade at a premium because without it investors couldn’t easily get leveraged exposure to bitcoin – but even then there were more than 100 other companies already doing the exact same thing – many at lower premiums – It just didn’t make sense to pay two dollars for a dollars’ worth of bitcoin.</p>
</details>

然而，对于Strategy的投资者来说，高于净资产价值（NAV）的溢价是一件好事——因为它创造了一个递归循环。如果股价为200美元，但只代表100美元的比特币，那么公司可以以200美元的价格发行新股，买入价值200美元的比特币，随后现有股东（或HODLers）每股所持有的“比特币”数量就增加了。投资者眼中的稀释，竟然是增益的。这是一种魔术——Strategy越是通过发行股票来购买比特币，现有股东就越富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This premium above NAV was a good thing according to Strategy investors however - as it created a recursive loop. If the stock trades at $200 but represents only $100 of Bitcoin, the company could issue a new share at $200, buy $200 worth of Bitcoin, and suddenly the "Bitcoin per share" of the existing holders (or HODLERS) went up. The way investors saw it - dilution was actually accretive. It was a magic trick – where the more stock Strategy sold to buy Bitcoin, the richer the existing shareholders became.</p>
</details>

### 分红压力与资本幻灭

截至本视频录制时，比特币价格约为9万美元，年内下跌约5%——这已包含股息和其他现金流。而Strategy的股价则下跌了约40%，情况更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As of the time of this recording, Bitcoin is trading at around ninety thousand dollars – which is down about five percent year to date - that includes dividends and all other cashflows… Strategy, on the other hand is down around 40 percent year to date – which is worse.</p>
</details>

Strategy的股价一向非常波动——虽然它不是标普500成分股，但其波动性甚至超过了该指数中任何其他股票，包括特斯拉和Palantir等迷因股。其高波动性促成了我前面描述的可转换债券发行，但对于某些投资者来说，这种波动还不够。散户纷纷涌入与Strategy挂钩的杠杆单只股票ETF，如MSTX和MSTU，这些基金年内已下跌约85%。据彭博社报道，它们已成为美国4700多只ETF中表现最差的前10名之一。其中一只名为MSTP的杠杆ETF，今年6月才推出，现已下跌近85%。如果你投资了这些产品——最好还是保持沉默，以免法院下令让布兰妮·斯皮尔斯的父亲来管理你的资金。彭博社本周早些时候报道称，这三只杠杆ETF的投资者自10月初以来已损失约15亿美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Strategy is and was a very volatile stock – while it wasn’t an S&P500 member – it was more volatile than any other stock in that index – even meme stocks like Tesla and Palantir. Its high volatility enabled the convertible bond issuance that I described earlier – but for a certain type of investor – the most volatile stock wasn’t volatile enough. Retail traders piled into leveraged single stock ETF’s tied to Strategy like MSTX and MSTU which are down around 85% year to date. According to Bloomberg, that puts them among the 10 worst-performing funds in the entire US ETF market, out of more than 4,700 products currently trading. One of these leveraged Strategy ETF’s – MSTP was only launched in June and is down almost 85%. If you invested in these – you should probably keep quiet about it so that a court doesn’t order Britney Spears’ dad to look after your money for you. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that investors in these three leveraged ETF’s have lost about $1.5 billion in assets since early October.</p>

### 现实的回归：当“空心公司”不再成立

《金融时报》报道，纽约证券交易所上市的芯片制造商Sequans，在转向数字资产财库策略仅四个月后，就出售了价值一亿美元的比特币来偿还债权人。其首席执行官对媒体表示：“我们对比特币财库策略以及对比特币的坚定信念未改变。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The FT reported that NYSE-listed chipmaker Sequans sold $100 million dollars worth of Bitcoin to pay creditors just four months after pivoting to a digital asset treasury strategy. It’s CEO told the press “Our Bitcoin treasury strategy and our deep conviction in Bitcoin remain unchanged.”</p>
</details>

日本最大的比特币持有者Metaplanet，在股价下跌80%后，以持有的比特币为抵押借入1.3亿美元。英国加密财库的典范Smarter Web Company股价下跌44%，并以低于其持有的加密资产净值的价格交易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Metaplanet - Japan’s biggest Bitcoin holder, raised a $130 million loan against its bitcoin stash after its stock fell 80%. Smarter Web Company, the UK’s poster child for crypto treasuries, is down 44% and trading at a discount to the crypto it holds.</p>
</details>

### 高息优先股与不可持续的循环

策略公司发行了具有激进名称的优先股，如“Strife”（10%票息）、“Strike”（8%）和“Stretch”（当前可变利率接近10.75%）。这些股息高昂，意味着公司每个季度都必须拿出数亿美元。起初他们通过发行股票筹资——虽然没有巨大溢价，但比特币仍在上涨。如果你以10%的成本发行股票来购买年涨幅超过10%的比特币，这是一笔增益交易。但若比特币涨幅低于10%，甚至下跌——你仍需每年向这些投资者支付10%的股息，从而摧毁价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For Strategy – if there is no recovery in the price of bitcoin, the real pain will begin in 2027, when the firm’s convertible debt starts to mature. Its borrowing – right now - is modest relative to its assets; but, its lack of alternative sources of income may force it to start selling its bitcoin.</p>
</details>

如今，Strategy被迫出售普通股来筹集现金，以支付优先股股东的股息。当你开始从新投资者那里融资来支付旧投资者时——你的策略就开始像一个庞氏骗局了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Strategy is stuck. It is now selling common stock to raise cash so that it can make dividend payments to preferred stock holders. Now when you start raising capital from new investors to pay out old investors – your strategy starts to seem like more of a scheme…</p>
</details>

正如彭博社的马特·莱文所言：“我们以高于净资产价值的价格出售数十亿美元股票来购买比特币——这是一个精彩的故事……但我们以净资产价格出售十亿美元股票来支付我们先前借款的利息——这可就无趣多了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine noted, “'We are selling billions of dollars of stock at a premium to NAV to buy Bitcoin' is a great story... 'We are selling a billion dollars of stock at NAV to pay interest on the loans we previously took out' is considerably less fun.”</p>
</details>

### 当幻觉消散：投机的尽头

为什么最近加密货币暴跌？我其实不知道。它根本做不了什么——它只是一个可以下注的数字。它甚至不适用于非法支付，因为稳定币在这方面更有效。因此，像比特币这样的资产价格仅基于人们对其未来是否会涨的预期而波动。它似乎已与科技股高度相关，但没有真正理由相信这种关联会持续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why has crypto been tanking recently – I don’t really know. It doesn’t really do anything – it’s just a number to bet on. It is not even that useful for illegal payments as things like stablecoins are better at that – so the price of things like bitcoin just rise and fall based on whether people think it will rise or fall in the future. It seems to have become highly correlated with tech stocks – but there is no real reason to believe that will continue.</p>
</details>

2013年，乔·韦辛瑟尔（Joe Weisenthal）发表了一篇题为《黄金是对人类失败的押注》的文章，认为购买黄金是一种“负面”的经济行为，因为它代表了对“闪亮的石头”比“人类集体智慧”（表现为股票和生产性公司）更能保值的押注。他指出，当投资者购买黄金时，他们本质上是在对“全面政治崩溃”和“和平人类互动的失败”进行对冲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 2013, Joe Weisenthal wrote a column called Gold Is A Bet On Human Failure where he argued that buying gold is a "negative" economic act because it represents a bet that a "shiny rock" will hold value better than the "collective ingenuity of the human race" represented by stocks and productive companies. He argued that when investors buy gold, they are essentially hedging against "total political breakdown" and the failure of "peaceful human interaction".</p>
</details>

他后来将这一逻辑扩展至比特币，称其是更深刻的“做空系统”形式，认为比特币的吸引力源于对国家能力和制度的彻底不信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He has since extended this logic to include Bitcoin which he describes as an even more profound form of "shorting" the system, arguing that Bitcoin’s appeal is based in a complete loss of trust in state capacity and institutions.</p>

《经济学人》上个月发表了一篇优秀的文章，题为《加密货币得到了它想要的一切。现在它正在沉没》。文中指出，加密行业已从被嘲笑的对象转变为被政客和监管机构广泛接受的行业。但这一胜利创造了悖论：追逐的刺激感已结束。近年来每一次主要上涨，都是由对特定里程碑（如ETF获批或友好美国政府支持）的预期所驱动。如今，这些战斗已经获胜，投资者“轻易就能获得比特币”，市场已耗尽了其最有力的看涨叙事。没有新的催化剂或“禁忌之果”的故事来吸引下一批买家，加密货币便沦为纯粹的投机性资产，没有任何新的理由让这个数字继续上涨。

<p class="english-text">The Economist wrote a good piece last month called Crypto got everything it wanted. Now it’s sinking. In the piece they argued that the crypto industry has gone from being an object of mockery to being broadly accepted by politicians and regulators. But this victory has created a paradoxical problem: the thrill of the chase is over. Every major rally in recent years was fueled by the anticipation of specific milestones—like the approval of ETFs or the backing of a friendly US administration. Now that those battles have been won and investors have "no trouble getting their hands on bitcoin," the market has exhausted its most potent bullish narratives. Without a new catalyst or a "forbidden fruit" story to sell to the next wave of buyers, crypto is left as a purely speculative asset with no fresh reason for the number to go up.</p>

### 信仰、迷因与系统的自我吞噬

我的朋友泽克·福（Zeke Faux）几周前出现在丹·图米的YouTube频道上——如果你还没看过，我建议你去看一下。我在描述中附上了链接。他在视频中提出了“Juggalo比特币韧性理论”。泽克认为，比特币已经发展出一群像Juggalos（狂热的Insane Clown Posse粉丝）一样忠诚、对外界批评免疫的拥趸——他们打扮成小丑，参加年度聚会。我应该提一下，丹·图米是ICP的狂热粉丝——所以在他面前别贬低他们……

泽克在视频中指出，正如你不会赌Juggalos不会参加他们的年度聚会一样，你也别赌比特币信徒不会出现来支持比特币价格——或者在我YouTube评论区里说“比特币和加密货币不一样”……根据泽克的说法，这是一种**教派（cult）**——它仅仅通过拒绝离开，就在资产价格下方筑起了一道防线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My friend Zeke Faux appeared on Dan Toomey’s YouTube channel a few weeks ago – and if you haven’t watched that video you should. I’ll put a link in the description. In it he explained his "Juggalo Theory of bitcoin resilience." Zeke argued that Bitcoin has developed a fan base as committed and impervious to outside criticism as the Juggalos, the die-hard Insane Clown Posse fans – who dress up as clowns and attend an annual gathering. I should mention that Dan Toomey is a huge ICP fan – so don’t say anything bad about them around him… Zeke argued in the video that much like the way - you wouldn't bet against the Juggalos attending their big meetup every year - you shouldn't bet against Bitcoiners showing up to support the bitcoin price – or showing up in my YouTube comments section to say that Bitcoin is somehow not the same as crypto.... They are a cult – according to Zeke - that puts a floor on the asset price, simply by refusing to leave.</p>
</details>

但泽克随后给这个类比加了一个关键转折：与Juggalos不同，比特币信徒有强大的财务激励去传教。“如果招募更多Juggalos能让你变富呢？”他问道。如果吸纳新粉丝直接增加你的净资产，你就会更加努力地招募他们——突然间，音乐听起来也会好听多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Zeke then adds a critical twist to the analogy. Unlike the Juggalos, who congregate for the love of “the culture”, Bitcoiners have a powerful financial incentive to evangelize. "What if by recruiting more Juggalos, you would get rich?" he asks. If bringing in new fans directly increased your net worth, you would work a lot harder to recruit them—and suddenly, the music might start to sound a whole lot better to you.</p>
</details>

### 无墙可破，幻觉终结

现在，Strategy已无“草根逆袭”的叙事来推动股价。也没有制度性的壁垒需要突破了。Strategy发行了如此多的可转换债券，以至于伽马对冲——即交易员在股价下跌时买入、上涨时卖出——已摧毁了其波动性。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）不再是反派，它只是一个监管机构——而且是由一个加密货币人士领导的。美国商务部长也是个加密货币人士。贝莱德（BlackRock）也不能被视为敌人；它是托管方。而美国总统不仅站边，他的大部分财富甚至都来自加密货币。
