title: 科技亿万富翁如何重塑美国政治？

### 科技寡头对美国政治的影响

美国的科技寡头们非常富有，其中许多人也对“**觉醒心智病毒**”（woke mind virus: 指在社会正义和身份政治议题上过度敏感或激进的思潮）、监管和民主感到非常愤怒，他们正在利用其非凡的财富和权力，试图让世界反映他们的愿景。

<p class="english-text">US tech oligarchs are very very rich and many of them are also very angry at the woke mind virus at regulation at democracy and they're using their extraordinary wealth and power to try to make the world reflect their vision.</p>

雅各布·西尔弗曼（Jacob Silverman），新书《镀金的愤怒：埃隆·马斯克与硅谷的激进化》（Gilded Rage: Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley）的作者，同时也是加拿大广播公司（CBC）播客《埃隆·马斯克的诞生》（The Making of Elon Musk）的主持人，探讨了埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）和彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）等人物如何结合企业和政府权力以实现其目标。

### 硅谷的早期历史与政治转向

硅谷的早期历史与冷战和国家安全机构有着密切联系，初创企业的早期资金主要来自国防部和美国国家航空航天局（NASA）。然而，硅谷后来是如何获得进步政治思想堡垒的声誉的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk early history of Silicon Valley because I think not a lot of people know that closely close ties to the cold war the national security state when we talk about sort of the early funding for startups those were coming from the department of defense NASA I want to get a better understanding how did Silicon Valley later gain this sort of reputation uh as a bastion of progressive political ideas.</p>
</details>

从许多方面来看，今天的硅谷实际上正在回归其早期根源。但在20世纪70年代和80年代，尤其是在60年代和70年代反主流文化运动之后，科技行业被视为一种新的前沿和几乎是反主流文化实验的新领域。许多参与旧金山嬉皮士运动的人最终学习了编程或投身科技行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. Yeah. In many ways, the Silicon Valley of today is actually returning to its early roots. But uh in the 70s and 80s, especially coming out of the 60s and 70s counterculture, the tech industry was seen as kind of a new frontier and a new area of almost countercultural experimentation. A lot of people, a lot of hippies who were involved in the hippie movement in San Francisco ended up uh getting learning how to program or getting involved in tech.</p>
</details>

它被认为是一个在态度上更加自由和进步的行业，对新型社会实验持开放态度。当时，无论是行业内部还是外部，它都不被视为与政府关系密切或支持国家安全机构或美国外交政策的特权。这种普遍的态度或文化在80年代和90年代持续了一段时间，可以说那是科技界的主流态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was certainly seen as an industry that was much more liberal and progressive in its attitudes, open to kind of uh new forms of social experimentation. And it wasn't seen and I think in inside as well the industry, it wasn't seen as close to the government or supporting the prerogatives of say the national security state or US foreign policy. And we had that general attitude or culture for a little while certainly in the 80s and 90s. I I would say that was kind of the prevailing attitude in tech.</p>
</details>

然而，9/11事件之后情况开始发生变化，并在近年加剧，以至于我们几乎回到了科技与政府在50年代和60年代直接由国防部资助时的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but things really started to change after 9/11 and then have kind of intensified in recent years, I would say, until we're almost more back to the relationship that tech had in in the 50s and 60s when it was being directly funded by the defense department.</p>
</details>

在那些进步的岁月里，科技界的关键人物包括斯图尔特·布兰德（Stuart Brand），他是《全球目录》（Whole Earth Catalog）的一部分，他更多是科技界的一个人物，而不是科技高管或首席执行官。还有其他一些人，他们从60年代和70年代的反主流文化中走出来，将计算机甚至早期的互联网视为探索思想和自我、以及与他人交流、形成马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）所说的“地球村”的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, uh, it depends what area you're talking about, but there's someone like, uh, Stuart Brand who was part of the whole earth catalog, which became sort [clears throat] of he was less a tech, he was more of sort of a a figure on the tech scene rather than a tech executive or CEO. But um he there were other people who kind of came out of that 60s and 70s counterculture who saw um computers and even and the early internet as these opportunities for exploration of the mind and the self and communicating with other people forming that global village that Marshall McLuhan talked about.</p>
</details>

最近，史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）曾公开谈论服用**迷幻剂**（acid: 一种致幻药物，在此指LSD）是他人生中最具启发性的经历之一，他甚至在一次公开讲座中向学生推荐。这确实关乎一些人认为迷幻剂能带来的感知变化，但它与现在科技界人士在火人节（Burning Man）等活动中进行的毒品实验有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then more recently, you had someone like Steve Jobs who would talk who spoke uh in public about how dropping acid was one of the most informative experiences of his life. And he recommended it to students at a at a public lecture, I believe. Uh and that was really, you know, about that that change in perception that some people thought that psych and some people still think that psychedelics can bring you. But it was a it was kind of a different version of the countercultural and of drug experimentation than even what you hear now from tech people who go to Burning Man, for example.</p>

### 硅谷的激进化与政治“海报男孩”

根据《华盛顿邮报》报道，旧金山80%的居民和硅谷附近县约70%的居民投票支持卡马拉·哈里斯（Kla Harris）。那么，“激进化”意味着什么？谁是这些“海报男孩”？值得注意的是，他们都是男性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. All right. So, let's uh fast forward here to uh 2024, the presidential election. According to the Washington Post, 80% of San Francisco residents and about 70% of residents in the counties near Silicon Valley vote for Kla Harris. So, explain to me what do you mean by radicalization and sort of who are the poster boys? And I say poster boys because incidentally they are all men.</p>
</details>

确实，他们都是男性。虽然科技界也有一些著名的女性特朗普支持者，如甲骨文（Oracle）前联席首席执行官萨弗拉·卡茨（Saffric Catz）或IBM的吉尼·罗梅蒂（Genie Remedi），但我们主要讨论的是本书中20到30位男性的群体传记，他们几乎都是白人男性，是百万富翁和亿万富翁。他们是科技公司的首席执行官，也是风险投资家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are all men. I mean there are a few prominent women in tech who are Trump supporters like Saffric Catz uh who was the co-CEO of Oracle or Genie Remedi from IBM. But you know this we are talking about and this book is a little bit of a group biography of 20 to 30 men almost all white men who uh are millionaires and billionaires. They are uh CEOs of tech companies. they are venture capitalists and of course at the top of this heap is Elon Musk but there's also a lot of his friends and colleagues people from the greater PayPal mafia as it's been called.</p>
</details>

当然，埃隆·马斯克位居榜首，但也有他许多朋友和同事，包括“**PayPal黑手党**”（PayPal Mafia: 指PayPal早期员工和创始人，他们离开PayPal后创办或投资了许多成功的科技公司）的成员。彼得·蒂尔长期以来一直是硅谷最重要的保守派人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course at the top of this heap is Elon Musk but there's also a lot of his friends and colleagues people from the greater PayPal mafia as it's been called. Peter Teal has long been probably the most important Silicon Valley conservative.</p>
</details>

在过去几年，尤其是在2024年大选前，真正的变化在于，一些传统的科技保守派，如彼得·蒂尔、大卫·萨克斯（David Saxs）或一些知名度较低的风险投资家道格·利昂（Doug Leon），以及他们的许多朋友和同事——那些社会和经济地位相似、与他们交往的人——开始真正地被激进化，反对民主党和共和党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think what changed really in the last few years leading up to the 2024 election was that you had some traditional tech conservatives like Peter Teal or someone like David Saxs or some lesserk known names like Doug Leon who's a major venture capitalist but then you had a lot of their friends and colleagues people of a similar social status and economic status who who spent time with the with them who really did start getting radicalized against the Democrats and Republican party.</p>
</details>

其中一部分激进化始于旧金山，他们开始将旧金山视为一个失败的城市，并将其归咎于自由派和民主党。他们担心旧金山正在发生的一些社会问题，如无家可归和露天吸毒，无法解决，并且正在蔓延到其他城市。这解释了许多转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some of that I think did really start in San Francisco where they started to see San Francisco as a failed city and they blamed it on liberals and on Democrats and they saw they feared that what was happening in San Francisco some of its its social issues the homelessness the open air drug use they essentially decided that it couldn't be fixed and not only that it was spreading to other cities and that I think explains a lot of the transformation.</p>
</details>

此外，一些首席执行官，如主要风险投资家马克·安德森（Mark Andre），开始认为当时的社会正义运动，如“黑人的命也是命”（Black Lives Matter）或最近针对以色列在加沙军事行动的抗议活动，是不可接受的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you also had um some of these CEOs people like Mark Andre who's a major venture capitalist starting to think that um the social justice movements of the time like Black Lives Matter or more recently some of the protests against uh Israeli military activity in Gaza um that they just found those movements unacceptable.</p>
</details>

你从科技界高层人士那里听到，尤其是在公开场合，他们认为这是“觉醒主义”失控，或者事情已经走得太远。因此，这些首席执行官和风险投资家以前可能容忍的自由态度甚至社会正义愿景，在疫情期间开始发生变化，达到了他们无法识别或不再愿意容忍的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you hear from senior people in tech but publicly especially that um they think that this is wokeness g run a muck or this is something that's gone too far. So whatever vision of kind of liberal attitudes or even social justice that some of these CEOs and venture capitalists may have tolerated before certainly during the co era that started changing to a degree that they they either didn't recognize or weren't willing to tolerate anymore.</p>
</details>

### 彼得·蒂尔：激进化的教父

彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）与埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）有所不同。马斯克曾称自己是半民主党半共和党，表现得更为热情，而蒂尔则始终坚定地保守。可以说，他是这场运动的“教父”。他从一开始就是个政治动物，而埃隆·马斯克则不然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk a little bit more about uh Peter Peter Teal. um a little bit different when you compare him to someone like Elon Musk who you put on on your book's title, you know, a little bit more enthusiastic, someone who's called himself, you know, at the time, at one time a halfdemocrat, half Republican, but when you look at Peter Teal has always solidly been conservative. Help me understand sort of his influence on the radicalization of Silicon Valley. He is sort of the the presiding godfather of this movement, I would say. I mean, he is a political animal from from the beginning. And someone like Elon Musk, I would argue, wasn't before.</p>
</details>

蒂尔自斯坦福大学（Stanford）求学期间就一直是坚定的保守派/自由意志主义者。他创办了一份名为《斯坦福评论》（Stanford Review）的保守派刊物，并自那时起一直为他的公司招聘该杂志的员工。他还曾是一名作家，并合著了一本名为《多样性神话》（Thy Diversity Myth）的书，这本书在今天看来基本上就是一本反“觉醒主义”的煽动性书籍。当时，最大的“妖怪”是多元文化主义和政治正确性，这在90年代初与我们现在所说的“觉醒主义”或进步政治的含义大致相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, uh, Teal has been a hardcore conservative/ libertarian since he was in college at Stanford. He founded a a conservative publication called the Stanford Review. He's been hiring people from from that magazine ever since for his companies. And um, he was also a writer for a while and he co-wrote a book called Thy Diversity Myth, which was basically today we would call it kind of like an anti-woke sort of rabel rousing sort of book. At the time, the the big bogeyman was multiculturalism, which and political correctness, which in the early 90s kind of meant the same thing as what we might talk about wokeness or progressive politics now.</p>
</details>

所以，这始终是蒂尔非常重视的事情。马克斯·查夫金（Max Chaffkin）曾为彼得·蒂尔撰写传记，他表示我们所知的“PayPal黑手党”网络，即那些在PayPal致富并随后资助了许多公司的人，最初更多是一个政治网络，而不是商业网络。是的，它源于PayPal，但这些人中有些对政治非常感兴趣，包括蒂尔。在2016年大选期间，蒂尔是硅谷与“让美国再次伟大”（MAGA）和特朗普竞选团队之间建立联系的关键人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that has always been something important to Teal. Max Chaffkin, who wrote a biography of Peter Teal, has said that the PayPal Mafia Network, which we know as sort of the group of people who got really rich at PayPal and funded all these companies afterwards, started more as a political network, uh, Chaffkin has said, rather than a business one. Yes, it came out of PayPal, but these were people who were very some of them were very interested in politics, including Teal. And Teal was the Silicon Valley figure during the 2016 election who was kind of helping broker those connections between Silicon Valley and MAGA and the Trump campaign.</p>
</details>

### 拜登政府时期的矛盾与右倾

在特朗普（Trump）第一任期结束后不久，以及拜登（Biden）政府初期，硅谷及其高管们进一步向右翼靠拢。这期间发生了什么，推动了这种转变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's talk a little bit about that time uh just shortly after uh Trump's first term. Uh I want to get a better sense of what's happening there because at the end of that and the beginning of his second term, Silicon Valley and the executives have kind of moved further to the right. What was happening between that administration, Biden administration, uh that kind of pushed everything that way?</p>
</details>

蒂尔本人会说，特朗普政府对他来说有点过于混乱。我认为科技界人士或特朗普的一些保守派支持者对他们未能完成想做的事情感到不满。与此同时，在拜登政府期间，新冠疫情肆虐。这些企业家与政府的冲突比他们过去习惯的更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Teal himself would say that um the the Trump camp the Trump administration was a little too chaotic for him. And I think there was some dissatisfaction among people in tech or certainly some of Trump's conservative supporters that they didn't get done the things that they wanted to get done. At the same time during the Biden administration there this is when COVID was raging. This is when some of these uh entrepreneurs are coming into more conflicts with the state than they were used to.</p>
</details>

我仍然认为这些冲突按大多数标准来看并非重大冲突，但例如，在新冠疫情期间的一些封锁或隔离措施，埃隆·马斯克尤其对不得不关闭他在加利福尼亚弗里蒙特（Fremont）的主要特斯拉工厂感到非常不满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would still argue that these weren't necessarily major conflicts by most standards, but for example, like some of the the shutdowns or quarantine uh methods during COVID, Elon Musk especially was very upset about having to shut down his main factory in Fremont, California, his main Tesla factory.</p>
</details>

他曾与地方当局就此抗争，最终表示：“你知道吗？我还是要开工。如果需要逮捕某人，那就逮捕我吧。”这体现了他典型的夸张风格。此外，还有其他例子，比如马克·安德森（Mark Andre），一位重要的风险投资家和政治人物，他表示拜登政府提议对**未实现资本利得**（unrealized capital gains: 指资产价值增加但尚未出售变现的收益）征税是他的“红线”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was something he bowed with local authorities about. He eventually said, "You know what? I'm going to open it anyway. If you need to arrest someone, let it be me." In his sort of typical overdramatic style. Um but there were other instances like Mark Andre, major venture capitalist, major political player now. He said that the red line for him was when the Biden administration proposed attacks on unrealized capital gains.</p>
</details>

这笔税款仅针对非常高的金额，数百万美元。但这意味着，如果你是一位投资初创公司的风险投资家，公司上市后股价飙升，假设你有数亿美元的账面收益，你可能需要为此支付一些税款。值得注意的是，这在拜登政府时期并未实施，只是被提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was really only over a very high amount of money, millions and millions of dollars. But this meant that if you were say a venture capitalist who invests in a startup, it goes public, the stock booms, and say you you have a hundred hund00 million in paper gains, you might you maybe have to pay some taxes on it. Now, it's worth noting this was not implemented under the B administration. It was just proposed, right?</p>
</details>

但安德森在他的播客上表示，这是他的“红线”，他非常不喜欢。因此，对于这些不同的人来说，他们有不同的关注点，但他们现在认为自己受到了当权者的更多压迫。他们还会抱怨莉娜·汗（Lena Khan），她可能是拜登最有效的任命者。她曾担任**联邦贸易委员会**（Federal Trade Commission: 负责保护消费者和促进市场竞争的美国政府机构）主席。她致力于保护消费者，阻止一些并购，或努力拆分一些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that was something that Andre on his own podcast said was a red line and he really didn't like. So, um, for some of these different people, they were different things, but they they saw themselves now as being a little more oppressed by the powers that be. Um, they would also complain about Lena Khan, who was probably Biden's most effective appointee. She was the head of the Federal Trade Commission. She's the person who would try to protect consumers, who would prevent some mergers from happening or work to break up some companies.</p>
</details>

从某种角度看，她实际上帮助增加了科技行业和商业世界的竞争。但当时的科技行业已经受够了监管，受够了任何阻碍他们的人。他们曾与当权者达成一种协议，即“我们纳税，我们捐一些钱给慈善机构，你们让我们做自己的事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think from a certain point of view, she actually helped um increase competition in the tech industry and in the business world. But the the tech industry at the time had sort of had enough with regulation with anyone standing in their way. Uh there was kind of this bargain that they had made with with the powers that be that you know we pay our taxes, we'll pay some we'll donate a little bit to charity and you let us do our thing.</p>
</details>

### “公民联合”案与政治献金的洪流

美国政治的激进化有多少可以追溯到2010年，因为2010年发生了一件大事：最高法院的“**公民联合**”（Citizens United: 美国最高法院在2010年的一项判决，允许企业和工会在政治竞选中进行无限制的独立支出）裁决。这扇门是如何为科技精英们打开，让他们介入政治的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I how much of this radicalization of US politics can be traced back to 2010 because something big happens in 2010 Supreme Court citizens united decision. Help us understand how that kind of opens up this door for tech elites to sort of some would say meddal in in some of the politics here.</p>
</details>

现在，我们生活在美国政治竞选活动无限支出（unlimited spending）的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now we live in the era in the US of unlimited spending for for political campaigns.</p>
</details>

在上次大选中，埃隆·马斯克捐赠了（或者说“投入”更准确）超过2亿美元，可能接近3亿美元。加密货币行业，我在书中也大量提及，成为了最大的行业捐助者，他们捐赠了约2亿美元，主要捐给了一个名为“公平摇摆”（Fair Shake）的**超级政治行动委员会**（Super PACs: 一种美国政治组织，可以无限制地筹集和支出资金，以支持或反对候选人，但不能直接与候选人竞选团队协调）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. I mean, the last election must donate more than or donated is a funny term, but put forward more than $200 million, probably closer to 300. The crypto industry, who I talk a lot about in my book, um became the biggest donor by industry, they donated about $200 million mostly to uh one political action committee, one of these super PACs called Fair Shake.</p>
</details>

尤其是在上次大选中，科技行业一旦投入某事，有时会全力以赴。他们习惯于筹集巨额资金，因此投入2亿或4亿美元用于政治目标对他们来说是合理的。自2010年以来，我们看到大量资金涌入政治领域，并创建了这些庞大的超级政治行动委员会。但我们从未真正见过一个行业，或者说科技和加密货币（它们某种程度上是一回事）同时投入如此多的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I think in the especially in the last election, the the tech industry, you know, they when they go get into something, sometimes they go all the way, you know, and they're used to raising huge amounts of money. So to put 200 or $400 million towards a political goal for them makes a kind of sense. And, you know, we had seen since 2010 a lot of money flooding into politics and these huge super PACs being created, but we had never really seen one industry or really tech and crypto together. they're they're kind of one and the same uh put forward so much money at the same time and that I think was really novel.</p>
</details>

这确实是前所未有的。与此同时，一些科技领袖，最著名的是埃隆·马斯克，基本上将自己植入特朗普竞选团队中，马斯克本人也经常与特朗普同台。这种行为也是我们以前从未见过的。这些企业家和科技精英的个人信仰与经营企业、成为精明商人之间有多少关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the same time you also had individual tech leaders most notably Elon Musk basically implant themselves within the Trump campaign and Musk himself starting to be on stage a lot and at Trump's side and that kind of behavior was also something we hadn't really seen before. How much of this is these entrepreneurs and tech elites uh personal beliefs versus running a business being being a a a sound businessman?</p>
</details>

我认为两者兼而有之。对其中一些人来说，这无疑是机会主义的。例如，谷歌（Google）在竞选期间并未公开支持特朗普，但我认为他们向他发出了某种祝贺，其前高管也出席了就职典礼，并拜访了白宫的特朗普。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a mix for some of them. It's certainly opportunistic. Like if you look at Google, Google didn't really publicly support Trump during the campaign, but I think they issued him some kind of congratulations and um its its ex top executives were uh at the at the inauguration. They visited Trump at the White House.</p>
</details>

像谷歌这样的公司，他们担心被拆分，因为他们正在经历反垄断诉讼。我认为其他一些大型科技公司也有类似的姿态，他们是机会主义的，并为自身利益着想。其中一些公司在特朗普第一次竞选期间就采取了一些政治立场，包括谷歌。谢尔盖·布林（Sergey Brin）曾相对低调地出现在旧金山机场，但被媒体发现并采访。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the case of something like Google, they're afraid of being broken up because they're going through an antitrust lawsuit. Uh, and I think some of the other big tech companies have a similar kind of posture where, you know, they are opportunistic and looking out for self-interest. Some of them took some political stances early in the first Trump campaign, including Google. You had Sergey Brin showed up at San Francisco airport somewhat quietly, but he was he was discovered there by media. He was interviewed.</p>
</details>

那是在2017年，他当时正在抗议第一次“穆斯林禁令”，并说：“我是一名难民。”因为他是一名来自苏联俄罗斯的犹太难民，他只是在那里表达自己的声音。现在，谢尔盖·布林正在与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）会面，而我们又面临着另一次“穆斯林禁令”。这表明，无论是在个人层面还是公司层面，一些事情都发生了多么戏剧性的变化。但我确实认为，尤其是在播客和社交媒体上发言的那些首席执行官和高管，他们已经完全转向右翼，并像马斯克一样被激进化了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is back in 2017. He was protesting the Muslim ban, the first Muslim ban, and he said, "I am a refugee." Because he was a Jewish refugee from Soviet Russia, and he was just showing up there and kind of making his voice known. Uh, now Sergey Brin is attending meetings with Donald Trump. And we have another Muslim ban going on. Uh, it just shows how dramatically both on an individual, I think, and on a company level, some of these things have changed. But I certainly think especially the people you hear t talking on podcasts on social media some of these CEOs and executives they have gone fully to the right and have been radicalized in the way that I think Musk has.</p>
</details>

### 科技精英对地方政治的介入与“网络国家”

几年前，富有的科技巨头开始介入旧金山的地方政治。旧金山记者吉尔·杜兰（Gil Duran）对书中提到的那些人的政治野心感到担忧，他曾说：“这些人有足够的钱，可以长时间地愚蠢和危险。他们必须开始寻找方法来夺取地盘和权力，创造一个与我们今天所知的美国截然不同的世界。我认为我们在旧金山政治中看到的，就是这种策略的出现。”杜兰所描述的策略有哪些例子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. I want to come back to a point that we were talking about sort of uh local politics. A few years ago uh wealthy tech mogul started weighing in on local politics in San Francisco specifically. I want to read a quote uh from Gil Duran a San Francisco based journalist alarmed by the political ambitions of those people that you mentioned in your book. These people have enough money to be dumb and dangerous for a very long time. They have to start finding ways to seize territory and power and create a different world that doesn't look anything like the United States we have today. I think what we're seeing here in San Francisco politics is like the emergence of that strategy. What are some of the examples of the strategy that Duran is uh describing?</p>
</details>

这里有几个重要的事情。首先，几年前我们看到的一个变化是，旧金山的科技界人士将更多的钱投入到地方政治中，因为他们意识到可以通过金钱获得一些东西。因此，我们看到了旧金山学区委员会成员的罢免，这是以前从未发生过的事情。大卫·萨克斯（David Saxs），现在是特朗普的AI和加密货币沙皇，就是这场运动的领导者，他捐赠了大量资金。

<p class="english-text">Well, there there are a couple of important things there. For one thing, the one of the one of the changes that we've seeded seeing a few years ago was uh tech people in San Francisco putting a lot more money into local politics because they realized they can get something for their money. So we saw a recall of members of the San Francisco school board, something that had never happened before. There was and people like David Saxs, who's now Trump's AI and cryptozar, were at the head of this. He was donating a lot of money.</p>
</details>

然后他们试图罢免州长加文·纽森（Gavin Newsome），但没有成功。但后来他们取得了重大胜利，罢免了地区检察官切萨·鲍丁（Chasa Bodin），他被认为是改革派的进步派检察官，但被污蔑为“索罗斯检察官”，被指责释放罪犯，并对旧金山犯罪率的上升负责。

<p class="english-text">And then they tried to recall Governor Gavin Newsome. That actually wasn't successful. But then they had a big victory when they recalled the district attorney, Chasa Bodin, who was considered this reformist, progressive DA, but really got tarred as someone who was a Soros DA who was, you know, letting criminals off and and responsible for an upsurge of crime in San Francisco.</p>
</details>

当时，这实际上是对情况的误读。旧金山的犯罪率，特别是暴力犯罪，并没有那么糟糕。当时有很多社会困境，有很多财产犯罪和非暴力犯罪，但这在当地人看来变得非常明显，对旧金山的精英们来说是无法容忍的。所以，这就是事情的开始。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that that was actually at the time even a misreading of the situation. I would say that the crime didn't uh necessarily crime violent crime wasn't in a bad way in San Francisco. what you had was a lot of uh social destitution. You had a lot of property crime and non-violent crime, but it had become very visible to people there and and intolerable to the San Francisco elites. So, that's kind of where it started.</p>
</details>

当吉尔谈论夺取实际土地和领土时，科技精英们有两条路线。他们参与常规政治，试图影响旧金山和全国（通过特朗普）发生的事情，但他们也是这些运动的一部分。其中一个被称为“**网络国家运动**”（network state movement: 一种旨在通过在线社区和加密货币等技术，在物理世界中创建新的主权实体或“国家”的运动），吉尔对此报道得非常好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And when Gil is talking about seizing actual land and territory, I mean, there's kind of two tracks that we see the tech elites on. They're involved in regular politics, you know, trying to influence what's happening in San Francisco and nationally via Trump, but they are also uh part of these movements. One's called the the network state movement that Gil reports very well on.</p>
</details>

他们也被称为“**特许城市**”（charter cities: 指由一个国家授权，在特定区域内建立一套独立于国家现有法律和行政体系的治理结构，通常由私人实体管理），他们实际上试图获得对土地的主权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're also called charter cities where they're actually trying to gain land where they can have sovereignty over.</p>
</details>

洪都拉斯（Honduras）是一个重要的例子，那里有一个名为罗阿坦（Roaton）的岛屿，上面有一个名为“繁荣”（Prospera）的定居点，由一家美国公司拥有。在洪都拉斯前一个更右翼的政权下，他们得以基本上购买这块土地的主权，并将其变成一个特许城市。这些事情的主要目标是逃避税收，建立一个由一小群科技精英运营的“定制国家”，这在某种程度上是一种**独裁**（dictatorship: 独裁统治）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Honduras is the big one which is there's an island called Roaton there and there's a settlement called Prospera which is owned by an American company, a piece of land there that under a previous more right-wing Honduran regime, they were able to essentially buy sovereignty over this land and turn it into a charter city. And the main goal of these things is really to escape taxes, to have a sort of bespoke nation that is somewhat of a dictatorship, you know, run by a small group of tech elites.</p>
</details>

他们经常谈论的一件事是，他们希望在这些特许城市中进行在美国或其他国家可能不合法的医学实验。这与该行业对延长生命研究或激进的人体实验的兴趣密切相关，而大多数人可能对此还不太适应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one thing that they talk about a lot that they want to do in these kinds of charter cities are medical experiments that may not be legal in in the US or other countries. This very much relates to the industry's interests in life extension research or or radical forms of human experimentation that most of us probably aren't that comfortable with yet.</p>
</details>

目前，从洪都拉斯到美国的一些地方，再到公海，再到格陵兰岛，都有很多这样的努力。有一个大型的特许城市初创公司会非常乐意看到特朗普在美国接管格陵兰岛，因为那可能是另一个潜在的领土。但实际上，他们正在寻找主权薄弱的地方，或者地方政府已经放弃，可以将其移交给公司或少数美国风险投资家的地方，让他们建立自己的社区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and there h there are a lot of efforts going on right now from in Honduras to even places in the United States to the open ocean uh to um Greenland. Uh there's a there's a big uh charter city startup that would be very happy to see Trump in the United States take over Greenland because that's another possible territory. But um really what they're looking for are places with weak sovereignty or places where the local government has given up and they can hand it over to a corporation essentially or a few American venture capitalists and say here start your own community and you know it's often presented as hey this is just what's wrong with a new community or building something new but it the in practice these things look more like mini dictatorships that are are really there to serve a few millionaires and billionaires.</p>
</details>

### 彼得·蒂尔与政治门徒

提到格陵兰岛，人们立刻会想到副总统J.D.万斯（JD Vance）。彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）在他的政治生涯早期资助了万斯。蒂尔是否按照自己的形象塑造了J.D.万斯，就像他创建“繁荣”定居点一样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned Greenland, so right off the bat, I'm thinking of Vice President JD Vance. Maybe not a a favorite there, but uh you talk about him a bit in in this book. Uh he was sponsored early in his political career by Peter Teal. Um did Teal create JD Vance in his own image or in a in the same way he created say Prosper?</p>
</details>

我认为万斯是自愿按照蒂尔的形象塑造自己的。蒂尔有一些门徒。像布雷克·马斯特斯（Blake Masters）这样的人，他在亚利桑那州的参议员竞选中失败了，或者其他为蒂尔工作了一辈子的人。有时他们直接来自《斯坦福评论》。万斯是在他人生中一个不同的阶段，在耶鲁法学院（Yale Law School）时遇到蒂尔的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think uh Vance willingly fashioned himself in Vance in Teal's image. I think there Teal has disciples of a sort. I mean, people like Blake Masters who didn't win his his uh Senate race in Arizona or other people who have worked for Teal basically their whole lives. Sometimes they come straight out of the Stanford Review. Vance was someone who met Teal a little at a different point in his life when he was at Yale Law School.</p>
</details>

正如万斯所描述的，他当时感到有些迷茫。万斯通过他自己的叙述和回忆录，将自己描述为在人生的不同阶段都在寻找身份认同感的人。他甚至改过几次名字，参军入伍。他试图摆脱困苦的出身。当他在耶鲁遇到前来演讲的蒂尔时，蒂尔是一个经常去许多大学演讲的人。根据万斯的说法，他听到有人非常聪明，但也告诉他要远离精英法律界那种以功绩为导向的激烈竞争。他还喜欢蒂尔的宗教信仰，蒂尔是基督徒。这深深吸引了万斯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he as as Teal I mean as Vance has described it uh he was felt a little lost. I mean Vance is someone who through his own narrative and and his uh memoir has described himself as searching for a sense of identity at different points of his life. I mean he even changed his name a couple times he went into the Marines. He uh he was trying to escape kind times hard luck upbringing and when he met Teal at Teal came to to give a speech at Yale. Teal is someone who goes to a lot of colleges even still to give speeches. And according to his account, he heard someone there who he thought was very smart, but also telling him to kind of get away from the merit- driven rat race of elite law. And also what he liked about Teal is that Teal's religious. He's a Christian. And that appealed a lot to Vance.</p>
</details>

此后，万斯的整个人生都因蒂尔而改变和塑造。但可以说，这是万斯自己的选择，他看到了一个可以作为榜样和导师的人，然后全力以赴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And after that, Vance got in touch with them. And from there, his whole life really changed and was shaped by by Teal. But it it was a it was a choice I would say of Vances of them of him seeing someone who he could use as a model and a mentor and then really going for it.</p>
</details>

### DEI与身份认同的讽刺

许多右翼巨头谴责**DEI**（Diversity, Equity, Inclusion: 多样性、公平和包容）政策。但讽刺的是，这些富有的科技巨头似乎以自己的方式痴迷于身份认同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Many right-wing moguls have denounced DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion policies. Uh but I'm hoping you can help me understand the irony here because it seems in their own way these wealthy tech moguls are obsessed with identity. How so?</p>
</details>

是的，他们中的许多人确实认为自己是精英，有些甚至认为自己是“**基因精英**”（genetic elites: 指认为自己因遗传或生物学因素而优于他人，通常与优生学思想相关）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh certainly a lot of them consider themselves elites and some of them consider themselves genetic elites. I mean and so in that way there what's the distinction between those two?</p>
</details>

不幸的是，在硅谷的许多地方，你会看到**优生学**（eugenics: 一种旨在通过选择性繁殖来改善人类遗传质量的社会哲学）的重现。这不仅包括我之前谈到的生命延长研究，还包括对**体外受精**（IVF: In Vitro Fertilization: 一种辅助生殖技术）和各种生殖程序的大量研究，这些研究超越了仅仅帮助人们生育或繁殖的能力，而是实际上筛选婴儿或胚胎以获得不同的特质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well you unfortunately you see a a recurrence in what could politely be called eugenics in a lot of Silicon Valley. I mean, not just what I was talking about with um this research into life extension, but uh a lot of research into um IVF and different reproductive procedures that go beyond just trying to, you know, make people fertile or ability to reproduce, but actually, you know, screening babies for or embryos for different qualities.</p>
</details>

我认为科技精英们有一种感觉，无论是作为备受尊崇的“创始人”（founder）、工程师还是风险投资家，他们都是这个杰出精英群体的一部分。与此同时，他们非常清楚自己的地位，他们中的大多数是白人男性，他们选择认为DEI和任何其他多样性措施，以及一些旨在纠正对边缘化人群的旧有错误的社会正义运动，反而是一种针对像他们这样的白人的受害或歧视形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think there there is a sense among tech elites that whether you're a founder which is a pretty hallowed identity or an engineer or a venture capitalist you are part of this distinguished elite at the same time you know more traditional forms of identity like they are I think they are very conscious of their status that most of them are white males and they have chosen to think that DEI and any other diversity measures and also social justice movements that some of which try to write old wrongs against you for marginalized people are h are instead um a form of victimization or discrimination against white people like them.</p>
</details>

因此，他们似乎觉得自己处于劣势，自己的身份受到了威胁，认为作为一个保守的白人男性是不被接受的。我当然不认为这是事实，我认为他们的成功就是证明。但他们觉得他们必须为自己的身份道歉，而现在他们有一种感觉，可以再次为自己的身份感到自豪，其中一部分就是将自己视为能够统治我们其他人的精英。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in that way that they seem to feel like they're on the back foot and that their own identity is threatened, that it's not okay to be a a conservative white male. Um I I certainly don't think that's true and I think that the proof is in uh how successful that they they've been but they feel like they sort of have to apolog the the the buying era having to apologize for who they are and now there's a sense that they can be proud of who they are again and part of that is considering themselves the sort of these elites the elect who can rule over the rest of us.</p>
</details>

### 未来展望：政府合同与安全国家

科技巨头们不仅成功地限制了加密货币和人工智能的监管，他们还在国家安全机构中根深蒂固，并领导着反DEI和反“觉醒主义”的行动。未来几年他们还会想要什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got one last question for you here. Um, tech moguls as as we discussed have succeeded in not only limiting regulations for cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence. They're becoming more deeply embedded in the national security state and they lead the anti-dei sort of woke charge. What will they want in the years ahead?</p>
</details>

他们当然将政府视为一个现金来源。他们想要政府合同，他们知道会有大量资金来自那里。一直以来都是如此，但鉴于右翼科技领袖们如何围绕特朗普，并正在充斥他的政府，他们现在正在寻求大额合同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they're certainly looking to the government as uh a cash source. They want contracts with the government. They want, they know that a lot of money is going to be coming from there. It always has, but um given how right-wing tech leads have kind of circled around Trump and are populating his administration, they're now looking for big contracts.</p>
</details>

我认为仍然会有面向消费者的公司，当然，他们会努力向公众销售产品。但像“**星门计划**”（Stargate initiative: 指美国政府或相关机构为数据中心和人工智能计算投入数百亿美元的计划）这样的项目，将数千亿美元投入到人工智能和计算的数据中心，这对科技行业来说是一个巨大的机会。我之前说过，他们正在回归50年代的版本，当时科技行业有一种愿景，认为它虽然起源于国防机构，但后来发展成为一个面向公众的行业，具有某种自由的反主流文化价值观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that there's still going to be consumerf facing companies, of course, and trying to sell their products to the public. But with something like the Stargate initiative, which is hundreds of billions of dollars being put into data centers for AI and computing, that that's a huge uh possibility for the tech industry. And I said earlier that they're kind of going back to the 50s version where, you know, there there was a vision of of the tech industry that used to say, okay, it came out of the the defense establishment a little bit, but then it found its own as this public facing industry with somewhat liberal countercultural values.</p>
</details>

但现在，他们非常自豪地回归为国家工作，为安全国家工作。这不仅仅是彼得·蒂尔的**Palantir**（Palantir: 一家美国软件公司，以其大数据分析平台闻名，常为政府机构和情报部门提供服务）这样的公司，还有谷歌、微软（Microsoft）等所有科技公司，以及像**Anduril**（Anduril: 一家国防技术公司，专注于为军事和政府机构开发人工智能和自主系统）这样专门为国防和情报机构服务的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now they're ve very proudly going back to working for the state, working for the security state. It's not just companies like Peter Teal's Palanteer, you know, it's Google, Microsoft, all the tech companies and also ones that are purpose-built to work for the uh defense and intelligence uh establishment like Anderil.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为他们现在看到了自己的未来，他们中没有人真正是实践中的自由意志主义者，即使他们有时在理论上声称是。他们更愿意与当权者联合，以一种在10或15年前的科技普通员工看来不可接受的方式，寻求共同的利润和权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I think that's where they see their future now is um none of them are really libertarians in practice even if they sometimes claim to be in in in theory and they are much more willing to unite with the powers that the and to seek mutual profit and power there in a way that I think wouldn't have been acceptable kind of to the tech rank and file 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
</details>

### 对新闻业和民主的担忧

雅各布·西尔弗曼被问及是否担心这些强大人物的权力，以及他所挖掘和发现的内容，以及他们是否知道他是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said last question but I am just curious. I'm going to throw one more at you. you talk about sort of you you've talked on your book about uh even working with some of these uh some of these very powerful people and uh with all the journalism and the research and all of the stuff that you do. Are you ever worried at all uh just in terms of how powerful these people are just in terms of what you're digging up and and so forth sort of what you're able to find and if they know who you are.</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼表示，他并不总是知道这些人是否知道他是谁。他曾参与一项法律动议，以揭露X（前身为Twitter）的股东，并且成功了。在进行这项工作时，他曾想：“哦，我想知道这是否已经传到了X的总法律顾问那里。”但他更广泛地担心新闻记者整体的处境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um yeah I don't always know you know if these people know who I am. I mean, I was involved I I was involved in a I filed a legal motion to get, for example, the the shareholders of X uncovered and and that worked. And, you know, when I was going through that, I was like, "Oh, I wonder if this has reached sort of the general council of X yet." But, um, I worry I worry more broadly about journalists in general, I would say.</p>
</details>

有时他确实会想到自己，尤其因为他是一名自由职业者，不总是隶属于大型出版物。人们告诉他，一些亿万富翁非常喜欢诉讼。其中一些人通过私人侦探或其他方式进行“肮脏勾当”。他们当然不介意诽谤他人，甚至只是在社交媒体上攻击你，让你成为当天的“反派”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, yeah, sometimes I certainly think about myself, especially because I'm I'm a freelancer. I'm not always attached to a big publication. And people tell me that some of these the some of these billionaires, you know, are very ligious. Some of them are work do their own dirty tricks through uh private investigators or other people. They certainly don't have a problem smearing others or even just, you know, kind of lighting you up on social media and making you the villain of the day.</p>
</details>

所以，这种事情令人担忧。更令人担忧的是，他们似乎对新闻业、公民社会和民主本身缺乏尊重。一些人，比如蒂尔，曾公开表示他们不是民主的忠实拥护者。马斯克曾说，也许我们需要一位罗马皇帝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that kind of stuff I think is concerning. I think what's more broadly concerning is how little respect they seem to have for journalism and civil society and democracy itself. I mean, these are some people like Teal who are on record as saying that they're not such big fans of democracy. Musk has said maybe we need a Roman emperor.</p>
</details>

所以，他当然担心自己，但也有一些人在《纽约时报》或其他地方揭露这个行业的重大秘密或丑闻。我们所有人都必须保持警惕，并且也要认识一位律师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I certainly worry about myself, but you know, there are people who are revealing big secrets about this industry or big scandals at at the New York Times or elsewhere. And you I think we all have to be a little bit on guard and know a lawyer, too.</p>
</details>
