title: 新重商主义时代？全球贸易政策的演变与挑战
summary: 本次访谈深入探讨了重商主义及其现代变体——新重商主义。专家们追溯了重商主义在17-18世纪欧洲经济思想中的主导地位，强调其将国际经济政策视为国家权力工具，并视国际经济互动为零和博弈的特点。访谈分析了新重商主义在当今全球经济中的复苏迹象，特别是在美国、中国和加拿大等国的贸易政策中，探讨了关税、国家补贴和保护主义措施的兴起，并反思了其对全球经济秩序和自由贸易原则的潜在影响。

### 重商主义的定义与核心理念

**Eric**: 首先，在我们这里给出一个定义之前，让我们先对我们所谈论的“重商主义”有一个大致的了解。重商主义主导了17世纪和18世纪欧洲关于国际经济政策的思考。重商主义的潜在信念是，国际经济政策主要是国家权力的工具，因为权力不像繁荣那样是相对的。重商主义者将国际经济交往视为一场零和游戏。你赢，我输。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: Before we get into sort of a definition here, let's get an idea of what we're talking about when we talk about mercantilism. Mercantilism dominated European thinking on international economic policy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The underlying belief of mercantilism was that international economic policy is primarily a tool of state power, since power, unlike prosperity, is relative. Mercantilists think of international economic engagement as zero sum. You win, I lose.

</details>

**Martin Wolf**: 这是《金融时报》今年早些时候马丁·沃尔夫的说法。埃里克，这是对重商主义的准确描述吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martin Wolf**: That was Martin Wolf in the Financial Times earlier this year. Eric, is this an accurate representation of mercantilism?

</details>

**Eric**: 是的，我可能会补充两点。第一，重商主义者相信权力和财富是紧密相连的。所以，如果你试图提升你国家的权力，你也在试图提升它的财富，两者之间存在一种相互关系。第二点我想补充的是，你知道，你可以成为一个相信提升国家权力和财富的人，同时又是一个自由贸易的信奉者。但在重商主义的情况下，他们提出的政策不是自由贸易。而是保护主义政策，但却是战略性的保护主义政策。所以这些人不是相信自给自足、自给自足，而是以战略性的方式利用保护主义来实现目标。同时，你的国家仍然处于一个相对开放的经济体中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: It is, I would add, maybe two things. One is that Mercantilists have a belief that power and wealth are deeply interconnected. So if you're trying to promote the power of your state, you're also trying to promote its wealth, and there's a reciprocal relationship there. And the other thing I would add is that, you know, you could be someone who believes in promoting the power and wealth of your state, but be a free trader. But in the case of mercantilism, the policy prescription that they have is not free trade. It's protectionist policies, but strategic protectionist policies. So these are not people who believe in autarky, self-sufficiency, but rather using protectionism and strategic ways to achieve objectives. While your state remains in a relatively open world economy.

</details>

**Eric**: 而且，如果我再补充一点，他们不仅对国家行为或国家干预感兴趣的是边境。它也在经济内部。所以有补贴和国有企业以及诸如此类的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: And if I can just add one additional thing, it's not just at the border that they're interested in state activism or state interventionism. It's also within the economy. So subsidies and state owned enterprises and all kinds of things like that.

</details>

**Drew**: 当我们想到重商主义时，我认为很多人会想到最大化出口、最小化进口。你刚才提到了其他一些特征，但当我们谈论重商主义时，关税或殖民化又如何呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: When we think of mercantilism, I think a lot of people think about maximizing export, minimizing imports. You mentioned a few other traits there, but what about tariffs or colonisation when we when we talk about mercantilism.

</details>

**Eric**: 是的。历史上，许多重商主义者也是帝国主义者。但并非所有重商主义者都是如此。所以在重商主义阵营中存在巨大的多样性。所以，我的意思是，一种看待重商主义阵营的方式是，它就像一种知识传统，类似于经济自由主义。亚当·斯密有很多追随者。在重商主义传统中，也有类似的思想家，其中一些人是帝国主义者，但另一些人是反帝国主义者。所以在这个问题上没有一致性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: Yeah. So certainly historically many mercantilists were imperialists as well. But it's not true of all of them. So there's a huge variety in mercantilist camp. So I mean, one way to think about the mercantilist camp is it's like an intellectual tradition, like economic liberalism. So Adam Smith has many followers. There's a similar line of thinkers in the mercantilist tradition, and some of them were imperialists, but others were anti-imperialists. So there's no consistency on that on that issue.

</details>

### 全球经济政策的转变

**Drew**: 德鲁，当我们放眼世界时，我们听到一些国家正在制定基于关税的贸易协议，变得更加自力更生。在你看来，这是否是当前正在发生的全球政治经济转变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Drew, when we look around the world, we hear of countries making trade deals based on tariffs, becoming more self-reliant. In your view, is this a kind of global political economic shift happening right now?

</details>

**Eric**: 确实正在发生转变。从特朗普政府的角度来看，自由贸易时期，它确实是二战后基于规则的体系的一部分，世界贸易组织所应用的，用亚当·斯密的说法，是“提高所有船只的水平”，或者正如埃里克所说，重商主义是真正的零和。因此，随着世界贸易组织的力量越来越弱，世界上有许多国家正在应用新重商主义的原则。如果你愿意，你可以看到唐纳德·特朗普的出口和进口，以及他对贸易逆差的担忧。这是这种转变的反映。还有补贴国家冠军和政府为自己考虑国家利益。这使得经典的自由贸易者处于更大的劣势，再次面对比美国大得多的国家，考虑到特朗普政府的走向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: There is a shift going on. And from the perspective of the Trump administration, the period of free trade, which really was part and parcel of the rules based system after the Second World War, what becomes the World Trade Organization was applying Adam Smith, in the sense of trade, raised all boats and and as Eric was saying, or you were saying, mercantilism is really zero sum. So you've got a whole series of countries around the world as the World Trade Organization becomes less and less powerful, that are applying the principles of neo mercantilism. If you like, you can see Donald Trump exports and imports and his concern about trade balances. This is a reflection of that. Also subsidies national champions and governments thinking about their country for themselves. And that puts us a classic free trader at an even greater disadvantage, up again against the much bigger United States, considering that that's where the Trump administration appears to be going.

</details>

### 中国的新重商主义

**Drew**: 好的，在我们谈到加拿大之前，我想谈谈两个最大的经济体。我们已经谈过了美国，但让我们谈谈中国。埃里克，中国一直是新重商主义思想的核心。你能给我们一些证据来支持这一点吗？我们看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: All right, before we get to Canada, I want to talk about the two biggest economies. We already talked about the US, but let's talk about China. Eric, China has been at at the centre of this neo mercantilism idea. Can you give us some evidence to sort of support this. What have we seen.

</details>

**Eric**: 是的。中国是一个有趣的案例，因为它有着悠久的重商主义或新重商主义思想传统。事实上，19世纪的中国思想家们推广这一理念时，他们会追溯到公元前3世纪的《商君书》，该书提出了权力和财富相互关联的观点。所以这是中国思想中一个根深蒂固的传统。习近平和中国现任领导人深受孙中山等20世纪早期思想家的重商主义思想影响。中国的新重商主义版本比美国的新重商主义思想传统（其根源也深植于19世纪）更具干预性。它只是以一种不那么积极、不那么干预的方式。它在历史上也更侧重于出口。这是中国新重商主义历史的一个关键特征。所以它有其独特的特点。但自1978年邓小平上台以来，中国无疑一直在推行新重商主义政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: Yeah. So China is an interesting case because it has a long tradition of mercantilist or neo mercantilist thought. In fact, Chinese thinkers in the 19th century who were promoting this idea, you know, would would reach back into the third century BC to the book of Lord Shang, who had ideas about power and wealth being interconnected. So this is a deep tradition in Chinese thought. Xi Jinping and the current era current leader of China is very informed by mercantilist thought figures like Sun Yat-sen from earlier in the 20th century, and the Chinese version of neo mercantilism is a much more interventionist version than, say, the history of American neo mercantilist thought, which also has deep roots in the in the 19th century. It's just in a less activist, less interventionist manner. It's also historically been much more export oriented. That's a key feature of the kind of Chinese history of neo mercantilism. So it's got its distinctive features. But certainly since Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978, China has been pursuing neo mercantilist policies.

</details>

### 美国政策的演变

**Drew**: 没错，我们在这里谈论了美国。特朗普的关税转向保护主义。这是否标志着全面转向重商主义，还是美国在这方面存在混合因素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: True, we talked about the US here. Trump's tariffs shifts towards protectionism. Does this signal a full move to mercantilism, or is there a mix here when it comes to the US?

</details>

**Eric**: 我们真的不知道。我的意思是，很难预测他在这条路上会走多远。但就目前而言，他肯定没有退缩。如果说有什么的话，他正在加倍努力。例如，如果我们考虑与中国的关系，他对中国贸易逆差、贸易顺差的担忧，其中很大一部分是以进入美国的消费品形式存在的。你知道，有一个长期的传统正在改变，即基本上每个人都是消费者，每个人都从低价中受益。现在我们面临的情况是，特朗普在十年前就预见了这一点，即对国内经济、对工人的担忧更强，对制造业等事务的担忧更强，这些事务已经在很大程度上从美国经济中被剥离了。以及作为消费者和作为经济体工人的平衡。巨大的变化。他可以在一定程度上强调这一点，这取决于他正在关注帮助哪些领域。目前。很难看到制造业在美国真正起飞，考虑到工资的规模，或者例如，你知道的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: We don't know really. I mean, it's hard to project predict how far he's going to go down this road. But as of now he's certainly not pulling back. If anything, he's doubling down. If we think about the relationship with China, for example, the concern he has about the size of the Chinese trade balance, trade surplus, much of that in the form of consumer goods coming to the United States. You know, there's been a long tradition that's changing now in which essentially everybody was a consumer and everybody benefited from low prices. And now we've got a situation in which and Trump was ahead of this a decade ago, in which much stronger concern about the domestic economy, about workers, about things like manufacturing that have been stripped out to a sizable extent of the US economy, and the balance between being a consumer and being a worker for the economy. Wide changes. And he can continues to emphasize that to some extent it depends. The success depends on what sectors he's looking at helping. Right now. It's hard to see manufacturing really taking off in the United States, given the size of wages or for something cool, for example, you know.

</details>

### 加拿大与贸易协议

**Drew**: 让我们谈谈加拿大，加拿大，中国，达成一项协议，以减少对加拿大海产品产品的关税，以换取一系列电动汽车。这是否属于重商主义的范畴？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Let's talk Canada, Canada, China, strike a deal for reduction in tariffs on canola seafood products in exchange for a set number of EVs. Would this fall into a category of mercantilism?

</details>

**Eric**: 在一定程度上，以及加拿大与美国相关的特殊条件。政府希望实现贸易多元化。而我们在过去几天看到的是美国的意愿。这对加拿大限制其贸易多元化能力是危险的。首先，我们75%的贸易出口到美国，中国则只有5%，你知道，所以你在多元化方面面临挑战。我们已经尝试了很多次，但都没有成功。我们现在可能看到的是一种新的进攻性重商主义，我想你可以这么说，在这种情况下，美国，正如我刚才所说，试图向加拿大施压，限制或选择在美国大市场和其他市场之间，特别是中国之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: I, in part and in part the special conditions which Canada has in relation to the United States. The government's desire to diversify trade. And what we're seeing in the last few days is the US desire. And this is dangerous for Canada to limit the ability of Canada to diversify trade. To begin with, 75% of our trade exports to the United States, China is more like 5%, you know, so you've got a challenge in terms of diversification. We've tried it many times and haven't been successful. What we may be seeing now is a new offensive mercantilist, I guess you could say, in which the United States, as I was saying, tries to put pressure on Canada by limiting or choosing between the big US market and other markets, in particular China.

</details>

**Drew**: 埃里克，在你看来，加拿大是在新重商主义体系内行事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Eric, in your view, is Canada acting within a neo mercantilist system?

</details>

**Eric**: 我的意思是，广义上说，任何时候你限制进口，你都可以将其归类为一种数量政策。如果目标是最大化你国家的权力和财富。我认为，在加拿大，你知道，我们长期以来一直对美国反对自由贸易做出回应。我们在19世纪中期有一个自由贸易协定，后来被废弃了。我们最终转向了19世纪70年代末的国家政策，这是一项旨在实现贸易多元化、努力建立国内市场的重商主义战略。这是我们对“火车脱轨”的被动回应。我们在大萧条时期也做过同样的事情，当时美国推出了《斯姆特-霍利关税法》。你知道，我们很快转向了英国市场，试图找到替代方案。1971年尼克松冲击发生时，你知道，我们再次试图实现多元化。我们试图建立国家市场。所以，在加拿大，这通常是对美国自身背离自由贸易的回应而采取的被动战略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: I mean, in a general sense, anytime you're putting restrictions on imports, you can classify that as as a numeric policy. If the goal is to maximise power and wealth of your state. I think in the Canadian case, you know, we have a long history of responding to the United States going against free trade. So we used to have a free trade deal in the mid 19th century that got abandoned. And we turned eventually to the national policy in the late 1870s, which was a neo mercantilist strategy of trying to diversify trade, trying to build up a domestic market. And it's a response, though it's a reactive response to us turning against O-Train. We did the same in the Great Depression when the US introduced the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. You know, we turned very quickly to British markets trying to find an alternative. When the Nixon shock happened in 1971, you know, once again, we tried to diversify. We tried to build up national markets. So it's in the Canadian case, it's generally been a reactive strategy in response to America itself turning away from free trade.

</details>

### 当今贸易协议的性质

**Drew**: 帮助我们稍微理解一下，是什么让今天的贸易协议与自由贸易旗帜下的贸易协议不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Help us understand a little bit what makes the trade deals of today different from the trade deals that were happening sort of under the banner of free trade.

</details>

**Eric**: 所以，在那个时代，你可以称之为19世纪90年代自由贸易的鼎盛时期，当时世界贸易组织成立，你知道，那是一套多边贸易谈判，基本上是“一刀切”。世界上许多国家都参与其中。我们现在正处于一套双边关系之中。我认为美国尤其希望有一套双边中心辐射式的关系，它们是中心，从而最大化它们的权力。我认为中国也想要同样的东西。你知道，他们历史上有一种朝贡模式，即中国会与世界各地的国家进行双边交易，并通过这些双边关系最大化其权力。所以这是中心辐射式关系与更广泛的秩序之间的区别，在这种秩序中，所有人都受相同的规则约束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: So in the in the era, which you can call kind of the high point of free trade in the 1890s when the World Trade Organization is created, you know, that's a multilateral set of trade negotiations where it's kind of one size fits all. And many of the countries of the world are involved in that process. We're in right now is much more of a set of bilateral relationships. And I think the United States in particular, would like a set of kind of bilateral hub and spoke relationships at which they are the centre, and that maximises their power. I think China wants the same thing. You know, it's a it's a kind of tributary model that they had historically, where China would make bilateral deals with states around the world and, and, and maximise its power through those bilateral relationships. So it's the difference between that kind of hub and spoke relationship and a more multilateral order in which all are governed by the same rules.

</details>

**Drew**: 宣传。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Propaganda.

</details>

**Eric**: 是的。所以中心辐射式关系是北美经济和北美自由贸易协定结构的一个很好的例子，它变成了现有的自由贸易协定《美墨加协定》。在20世纪90年代初，美国只想和墨西哥谈判自由贸易协定，我们坚持要作为三边协定的一部分。现在，美国提出的《美墨加协定》的延续性之一是“双边”，这将触及同样的中心辐射式担忧。这是我们施加更大压力迫使加拿大首先服务于他们的一部分，但在他们不轻易行事的情况下，他们希望我们首先服务于他们，但在他们利用其权力的情况下，简单地说，你想表达一个观点。埃里克说得非常对。以加拿大的历史来看，我们认为自由贸易是过去40年和面向美国的一部分。从统计数据来看，重新定位的程度较小。但是国家政策、关税壁垒、在国内建立制造业的想法，对我们来说，这始终是第二选择。美国基本上给了我们一个二元选择。你可以自由贸易。如果你想成为这个国家的一部分，如果你不想成为这个国家的一部分，你就不会有自由贸易。我大大简化了，但其中有很多真实之处。而这种平衡，尤其是在美国本身的情况下，随着埃里克所说，在全球自由贸易方面，对我们来说总是很难找到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: Yeah. So the hub and spoke relationship is a good, good example in the North American economy and the structure of NAFTA, which became CUSMA the existing free trade agreement in the early 1990s, the United States wanted to negotiate a free trade agreement only with Mexico, we insisted, and this is after the bilateral agreement of being part of a trilateral agreement. Now, the United States, one of the things they floated with regard to the continuation of the USMCA is dual bilateral, which would get at the same concern with regard to hub and spoke. It's part and parcel, I think, of us putting greater pressure on Canada to serve them first, but in circumstances where they're not making it easy, they want us to serve them first, but in circumstances because of their power to take advantage is simply put, you know, I want to make a point. Eric was exactly right. With Canadian history, we think of free trade as having been part and parcel of, you know, the last 40 years and the reorientation towards the United States. There was less of a reorientation than, you know, in terms of the statistics. But the idea of a national policy, tariff wall build manufacturing at home. For us, that was always a second choice. The United States essentially offered us a binary choice. You can have free trade. And this goes back to the 19th century if you become part of the country, if you don't want to become part of the country, you're not going to have free trade. I'm simplifying hugely, but there's a lot of truth to it. And that balance, especially, as Eric said in the context of the United States itself, changing with regard to free trade globally was always tricky for us to find.

</details>

**Eric**: 我只是想补充一点，德鲁提出的观点非常有趣。而且，为了强调这一点，我们以前经历过这种情况。所以特朗普的英雄之一是麦金利，19世纪末的总统。麦金利以1890年的“麦金利关税”而闻名，其目的是向加拿大施压。麦金利本人并没有这么说，但当时麦金利身边的人试图向美国施压，迫使加拿大吞并。所以这是一个悠久的历史，我们必须以过去的方式做出反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: I was just going to add, it's a really interesting point that drew was making. And just to highlight that we've been through this before. So one of Trump's heroes is McKinley, the president from the late late 19th century. And McKinley is well known for something called the McKinley tariff in 1890, which did have the objective of pressuring Canada. And McKinley himself did not say this, but there were people at the time around McKinley who were trying to pressure United States, pressure Canada into annexation. And so this is a long history, and we have to react to it in the ways that we have in the past.

</details>

### 加拿大的定位与挑战

**Drew**: 那么，加拿大在这其中扮演什么角色呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: Where does Canada fit in all of this, then?

</details>

**Eric**: 这确实充满挑战，因为加拿大作为一个西方中等强国，有几个独特的方面。我们依赖贸易。我们依赖一个国家，你知道，他们可以挑战我们最好的朋友，但他们却不是。而且这种情况突然改变了。在自由贸易和1988年大选之后，我们已经习惯了这种环境。现在全球环境已经改变了。这是总理在达沃斯演讲的一个小节。我们面临的挑战之一是，我们像许多西方国家一样依赖贸易。美国，顺便说，不是因为它的国内市场如此之大。它们之间的贸易量比任何其他西方国家都多。我们处于较高的一方。但当然，这种依赖是针对一个国家的。总理现在试图做的是稍微摆脱这种依赖，走向世界各地进行交易，其中最具争议的是中国。我们以前尝试过，现在我们取得了一些进展，但这并不能替代正在背离我们的美国市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: It's really challenging because there's a few distinct aspects of Canada as a Western middle power. We are trade dependent. We are trade dependent on a country that was always, you know, they can be challenging our best friend and they're not. And it's changed suddenly. So we have come after free trade and the election of 1988 to be comfortable with this environment. And now the environment globally has changed. It's a little bit of a subset of the Prime Minister's speech in Davos. And part of our challenge is we, you know, are trade dependent like many Western countries. The United States, by the way, isn't because its domestic market is so big. They trade within themselves a lot more than any other Western country. We're on the higher side. But of course that dependence is on one country. And what the Prime Minister now is trying to do is shake this off a little bit and go around the world and do deals, the most controversial being China. And we have tried this before, and right now we are making some progress, but it's not a substitute for the US market that's turning its back on us.

</details>

### 新自由主义的终结？

**Drew**: 好的，埃里克，这是某种程度上的终结，你知道，自由市场，最小化的政府干预。这是新自由主义的终结吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: All right, Eric, is this the end of sort of, you know, free markets, minimal government, you know, intervention. Is this the end of neoliberalism?

</details>

**Eric**: 所以，目前我可以说“是”，但很难知道我们将走向何方。我的意思是，我认为争论我们正处于这种情况的原因是，美国正在回归一种对它们来说非常普遍的政策，你知道，在1945年之前，即我指的是，人们甚至在19世纪将新重商主义称为“美国政治经济体系”。所以这是一个根深蒂固的传统。德鲁提到了卡尼的达沃斯重要演讲，在同一次会议上，美国贸易代表詹姆斯·格林发表了演讲，他引用了这段历史，并说，你知道，这是美国的保护主义历史。因此，在某种程度上，美国正在回归一种对它们来说历史上正常的历史性常态的看法，这对全球体系来说是一个巨大的冲击，因为自1945年以来，美国一直是推动更开放世界经济的领导者。所以是的，从这个意义上说。但我认为，就未来而言，更有趣的问题是，这能持续多久？那么，美国国内是否会对特朗普的一些保护主义措施产生反作用？因为他所做的保护主义措施比特朗普经常提到的19世纪时期的保护主义措施更为极端。举个例子，为了在这里结束，你知道，我之前提到的1890年的麦金利关税在1892年的选举中在美国引起了反响。你知道，曾有过一次转向自由贸易的推动。所以这不是一成不变的，但正如德鲁认为的那样，这无疑是一个巨大的冲击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: So at the moment I would say yes, but but it's hard to know where we're going. I mean, the reason, I think to argue that that is the situation we're in is that the US is returning to a policy that was very common for them, you know, before 1945, which was I mean, people even referred to neo mercantilism in the 19th century as the American system of political economy. So this is a deep rooted tradition. Drew made reference to Kearney's important speech in Davos, the speech that was made at the same meeting by Jameson Greer, the US Trade Representative, invoked this history and said, you know, this is the American history to be protectionist. And so to the extent that that that kind of worldview that the US is returning to something that for them is historically normal, is a massive shock to the global system, because the US, since 1945, has been the leader of promoting a more open world economy. So yeah, in that sense. But I think the more interesting question in terms of looking forward is does that last? So will there be a backlash within the United States to some of the Trump protectionism? Because the kinds of kinds of protectionism he's done have been much more extreme than were even done in the kind of 19th century era that Trump often invokes. And just to give you one example, to finish up here, you know, the McKinley tariff that I mentioned earlier of 1890 produced a reaction in the United States and some of the 1892 elections. You know, there was a push back towards free trade. And so this isn't this isn't set in stone, but it's certainly a massive shock in the way that drew, I think, is accurately depicting.

</details>

**Drew**: 德鲁，在1890年至1892年期间，恰巧是我们可能称之为皮卡尼人入籍的时期，至少直到现在。当时有相当大的选民支持，绝非多数，在边境地区支持吞并。而在那个十年后期，随着西部的增长，加拿大变得更加自信。经济上。这似乎又出现了，多年后，在加拿大几乎没有支持，部分原因是，你知道，唐纳德·特朗普在所有我们正在谈论的情况下都提出了这一点。这是一个非常有趣的时刻。让我举一个埃里克谈到的重商主义局限性的例子。假设特朗普迫使苹果回家。去年有一本好书，《中国苹果》。对。一本关于他们战略的好书。如果iPhone在美国制造，成本会有多高？如果手机价格翻倍甚至翻三倍，消费者的反应会如何？政府在补贴美国消费者方面又会有何反应？你不会费心去补贴加拿大消费者。你知道，仅仅作为一个重要的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew**: So that period of 1890 to 1892, incidentally, is what we might call Piikani accession, at least until now. There were significant there was significant voter support, not majority by any means in border areas for annexation. And in the later part of the decade, as the West grew, Canada grew more confident in itself. Economically. That disappeared to come up now, many years later, with very little support in Canada, in part because, you know, it's being offered by Donald Trump in all the circumstances that we're talking about. It's a really interesting moment. Let me give an example of maybe the limits that Eric was talking about with regard to mercantilism. Let's say that Trump forced Apple to come home. There's a good book in the last year, Apple in China. Right. Great book on you know, their strategy there. How much would an iPhone cost if it was made in the United States. And what's the consumer reaction if that phone doubles or even triples? And what's the reaction of the government in terms of subsidising American consumers with regard to that? You're not going to bother with subsidising Canadian consumers. You know, just as one significant product.

</details>

**Eric**: 过去，正如你所提到的，重商主义导致了一个更加分裂的世界和冲突。这次我们走向何方？我先从埃里克开始，然后我们以，是的，是的，结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: In the past as you as you mentioned, mercantilism has led to a more fractured world and conflicts. Where are we headed this time? I'll start with Eric and then we'll finish with yeah, yeah.

</details>

**Eric**: 迅速地。新重商主义不一定需要是一个充满冲突的世界。所以一些最著名的重商主义思想家，弗里德里希·李斯特或亨利·凯里，他们都相信国际合作。所以问题是，特朗普是否正在做他试图做的事情，作为一种暂时的策略，然后达成某种新的国际协议？他身边的一些人谈论新的布雷顿森林体系，或者詹姆斯·格林一直在谈论新的国际经济体系。或者特朗普是否处于一种无休止的交易模式中，即永远没有最终结果？如果是后者，那么我们就处于一个更加充满冲突的世界。如果是前者，那么我们正处于一个暂时的阶段，试图建立一个新的需要谈判的均衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric**: Quickly. Neo mercantilism does not necessarily need to be a conflictual world. So some of the most famous Neo thinkers, Friedrich List or Henry Carey, those people believed in international cooperation. So the question is, is Trump doing what he's trying to do as a temporary strategy to then reach some kind of new international agreement? And so some of the people around him talk about a new Bretton Woods or Jameson Greer has been talking about a new international economic system. Or is Trump in a mode of kind of endless deal making where there's never any final outcome? And if it's the second one, we're in a much more conflictual world. If it's the first one, we're in a kind of a temporary phase where there's an attempt to establish a new equilibrium which needs to be negotiated.

**Eric**: 我担心。完全正确。我担心是后者，很难不考虑总统。他身边有聪明人。詹姆斯·格林是其中之一，他们从中期、长期来看。但当然，这个政府有很多问题。我们看到，就加拿大而言，你知道，加拿大有4000万人，他们从美国购买的商品和3.4亿美国人从我们这里购买的商品一样多。我们如何利用他们？我的意思是，如果你不能和加拿大相处，你知道，你真的不能和任何人相处，这就是我目前担心的，来自政府。但我们会拭目以待。

**Eric**: I fear. Exactly right. I fear it's the second it's hard to think about the president. He's got smart people around him. Jameson Greer being one of them, thinking medium term, thinking long term. But of course, it's this administration with all sorts of problems. And we see that with regard to Canada, you know, we've got 40 million people in Canada who buy as much stuff from the United States as 340 million Americans buy from us. How are we taking advantage of them? I mean, if you can't get along with Canada, you know, you can't really get along with anybody, which is what I fear right now from the administration. But we'll see.
