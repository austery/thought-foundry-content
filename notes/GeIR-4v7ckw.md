### 地缘政治动荡推升贵金属价值

本周市场经历了剧烈波动，尤其引人注目的是黄金和白银价格的飙升。白银已突破100美元大关，黄金价格也逼近5000美元。这种贵金属的“超级反弹”并非孤立事件，而是与近期一系列地缘政治事件紧密相连。我们回顾了在**达沃斯论坛**期间发生的事件，并将其与贵金属市场的表现联系起来，因为两者之间存在显著的关联性。

在分析贵金属市场时，白银的表现尤为突出，其价格走势呈现出近乎“抛物线”的形态。正如许多人所知，白银在某种意义上可以被视为“原始的模因币”（original memecoin），其吸引力远早于 meme 股票、加密货币或 NFT。零售投资者历来对购买白银表现出极大的热情。纵观其历史，白银周期性地经历抛物线式的飙升，随后又可能大幅回落。目前，我们似乎正处于又一个抛物线式上涨的阶段。在这样的上涨过程中，其最终高度往往难以预测，市场中充斥着对150美元甚至300美元的猜测，而不久前，100美元还曾是人们热议的上限。与此同时，黄金也表现强劲，但其上涨趋势显得更为稳健。

贵金属价格上涨的一个关键驱动因素是日益加剧的地缘政治风险。上周末，**欧盟与美国之间爆发贸易战**的前景一度笼罩市场。美国总统曾就格陵兰岛问题向欧盟施压，并暗示若无法如愿将对欧盟加征关税，欧洲领导人则坚决回应将予以反击。这一背景让人联想起去年“解放日”贸易战的记忆，当时4月份市场经历了剧烈波动，美国资产（包括美元、股票和国债）普遍出现大幅抛售。事后数据显示，去年4月存在大规模的外国资本从美国资产撤离的现象，但数月后这些资金又重新流入，使得去年整体而言，美国股市的资金流入量相当可观。

“做空美国”（Sell America）的交易策略在去年短暂出现后，本周随着贸易紧张局势升温而卷土重来，市场充斥着对局势如何发展的疑虑。随后，美国总统前往达沃斯，在与欧洲领导人会晤并发表讲话时，重申了美国对格陵兰岛的“绝对需要”，并强调了美国对北约的贡献，暗示北约可能不会永远支持美国。他甚至暗示，欧洲国家或许应“友善地”满足美国的要求。然而，真正缓解市场紧张情绪的是，总统明确表示**不会使用军事力量夺取格陵兰岛**，这消除了此前市场对军事冲突的担忧。此后，有传言称已形成某种协议框架，各方似乎都采取了缓和姿态，并将在细节公布后达成一致。这一消息迅速逆转了“做空美国”的趋势，表明这只是一个短暂的市场情绪波动。

在此期间，一些欧洲养老基金，特别是丹麦的一家基金，公开表示已出售了其持有的全部美国国债（约1亿美元）。尽管如此，仍有分析人士认为，欧洲联盟可能通过抛售美国资产来向美国施压，因为美国总统高度关注股市表现。数据显示，欧洲投资者确实持有大量美国资产，其中美国股票是最大头。这并非出于对美国总统的“好意”，而是因为美国股市，尤其是与人工智能（AI）相关的领域，提供了欧洲市场难以比拟的投资机会。尽管“做空美国”的交易短暂出现后迅速消退，但它反映出全球对世界格局变化的日益不安。欧洲领导人，如**欧洲央行行长拉加德**（Christine Lagarde），已明确表示需要进行一次彻底的**SWOT分析**（优势、劣势、机会、威胁），以应对这一“更大的警钟”，并决定如何实现欧洲的独立强大。然而，长期以来，技术官僚的治理效果并不理想，这表明许多人尚未完全认识到世界正在发生的深刻变化，尽管他们正开始觉醒。

在所有这些动荡中，贵金属成为了一颗耀眼的明星。即使在去年4月的“做空美国”交易期间，当几乎所有资产表现不佳时，黄金却表现出色。这似乎表明市场日益认识到，当风险源自美国时，黄金是一种有效的对冲工具。**国际清算银行（BIS）**上个月的一项研究指出，黄金市场可能存在泡沫，因为大量资金流入是由零售投资者推动的，这与黄金作为一种更偏向零售的投资属性相符。专业投资者通常追求现金流，但现在市场对黄金作为投资组合多元化工具的认识正在增强。如果这一趋势持续，许多大型投资经理和机构投资者可能仍处于“低配”状态，这预示着黄金价格可能还有进一步上涨的空间。至于白银，其走势可能更为独立，但地缘政治风险以及对黄金多元化配置价值认识的提升，无疑为其提供了强劲的支撑。

在达沃斯论坛上，**加拿大总理马克·卡尼**（Mark Carney）的演讲也令人印象深刻，并获得了广泛好评。卡尼指出，世界已经改变，中等强国必须团结起来，否则“不在桌上就会成为盘中餐”。他含蓄地批评了美国“霸权且具侵略性”的行为，并呼吁其他国家团结起来，否则将遭受损失。这番言论是对当前政治局势的清晰分析。然而，此番言论也引发了美国总统的强烈不满，总统公开批评了他，并威胁对加拿大与中国达成贸易协议征收关税。尽管如此，卡尼仍在积极推动关系多元化，他上周访问中国并达成了加拿大向中国出口菜籽油的协议，同时加拿大也调整了对中国电动汽车（EVs）的100%关税，引入了配额制。尽管加拿大国内（如安大略省汽车产业基地）对此存在一些争议，但这表明卡尼正在积极构建更广泛的国际关系网络，不仅与欧洲，也与中国。目前，加拿大大部分贸易仍与美国进行，因此实现贸易关系多元化是合理且明智的。但卡尼的举动无疑令美国总统感到不悦，其演讲带有明显的挑战意味。此外，即将到来的**北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）**重新谈判也可能因此变得复杂。

在地缘政治方面，我们还需关注日益增长的风险，尤其是在中东地区。近期有报道称，军事资产正被调往中东，这可能为黄金提供支撑。如果美国决定打击伊朗，这将成为黄金价格的又一重大利好。

从更传统的宏观指标来看，上周发生的一件重要事件与去年“做空美国”交易的演变相似。去年，尽管美国国债和股票在抛售潮后有所反弹，但美元却未能完全恢复，全年表现疲软。本周，美元同样表现不佳，美元指数出现显著下跌，而美元走弱通常会给黄金带来上行压力。美元兑多种货币都在贬值，唯独日元一度保持坚挺，直到本周五才出现变化。

<summary>Original English</summary>

This past week was a whirlwind in markets, and we have a lot to talk about. However, a lot of the things that happened also did resolve by the end of the week. So today, let's talk about two things. First off, let's talk about the ongoing super rally in gold and silver. Silver breaching $100, gold just shy of 5,000. And as we discussed, we also have to weave in what happened in Davos because I think the two are related.

Now, starting with the precious metals. If you look at a chart of silver, it looks like it's gone absolutely parabolic. Now, as you guys know, silver is basically the original memecoin. Before there were meme stocks, before there was crypto, before there was NFTTS, there was silver. And retail investors really, really liked buying silver. Over its history, silver often, well, periodically goes into these parabolic surges and then uh implodes. So, it looks like we're in another parabolic surge. Silver just, you know, when these happen, you have no idea how high it can go. Whispers of 150, whispers of 300, and honestly, not too long ago, the whispers were for 100. Now, gold is also, of course, doing very well as well, but then that seems to be a much steadier trend.

Now, one of the big drivers of the precious metals rally has to do with geopolitics. Last weekend, we had the prospect of an EU-US trade war. The president had told the European Union that he needed Greenland and if he couldn't get it, he would put tariffs on them. European leaders stood up for themselves and also suggested that they would fight back. Now, with this background, we kind of had flashbacks from the liberation day trade war last year. Remember last April was a very volatile time in markets. What happened then though was that there was a big sell-off in US assets. So the dollar sold off, equity sold off, and even treasury sold off, a very unusual combination. In retrospect, when we look at the official data, it becomes clear that there was a big foreign exodus from US assets in April. But the foreigners came right back months later and actually last year, according to official data that we have so far, was a pretty big year for inflows into US equities. So the sell America trade last year was fleeting, but it did come back this past week as prospects of the trader were heating up. There was very much a sell America trade, and so there was a lot of uncertainty as to how this would resolve.

Now the president went to Davos, met with all the European leaders on the stage. He gave a speech. He basically reiterated the absolute need for the US to have Greenland. Suggested that, you know, the US has always been there for NATO. You know, it doesn't seem like it's uh NATO may not always be there for the US. After all, it doesn't have much military. So, you know, maybe these guys should, you know, be nice and do him a solid and give him Greenland or something like that. So what did calm the market a lot though was the president said that he would not use military force to take Greenland, and for some reason there were rumors or fear of that could happen, and when the president affirmed that, that seemed to calm the markets down a lot. Um, later on, there were whispers that there was a framework of a deal. It seemed like everyone climbed down and they would work something out, details uh to be announced. Now this really uh reversed the sell America trade pretty quickly. So it was really again, just a fleeting moment. Uh, during that moment though, you did have European uh pension funds, one in uh in Denmark in particular, I believe, go out and tell everyone that they sold all their US treasuries. They held about 100 million. So basically zero. But there were talking heads that were suggesting that maybe the European Union could put pressure on the US by selling US assets. After all, we all know that the president cares very much about the stock market. Looking at the data, it's clear that the Europeans do hold a lot of US assets. Among them, the largest category is US stocks. Not for the goodness and not out of the goodness of their heart or for the benefit of the president, of course, but because US stocks have been a pretty good investment, especially if you want exposure to AI, which the European Union doesn't have very much of. Um, but so far this uh this sell America trade happened briefly, unwound again, but it's something that seems to be lurking in the background. There is increasing unease uh with how the world is changing, and the European leaders, I think President Lagarde of The ECB memorably told everyone that she would do a SWOT analysis, strengths, weaknesses, uh opportunities, threats, like a good technocrat. This is a wakeup call, a bigger one than we ever had. And I think that Europe is going to look at its strength, look at its weaknesses, do a, you know, a big SWOT analysis and decide what do we need to do to be strong by ourselves. Um, but of course, technocrats have been doing a terrible job over there for a long time. Um, so it just kind of shows to me at least that a lot of people there just don't fully grasp that the world is changing, but they are beginning to now. One star that stood out throughout all this turmoil was precious metals. Now, even last April when we had the Sell America trade, everything did poorly, but gold did well. So it seems like there's growing awareness in the markets that when you have risk that emanates from the United States, gold is a good hedge. And there's an interesting work from the BIS just last month suggesting that we may be in a bubble in gold because a lot of the inflows were driven by retail investors, which makes sense to me since gold really is more of a retail investment. If you are a professional investor, you know, you go to economist school and they read Ben Graham or something like that and they want cash flow. But I think there's more awareness now that you can have gold as a portfolio diversifier. And if that's the case, a lot of the large investment managers, big accounts are going to be underinvested. And so, uh, that suggests that there could be further upside in gold. I mean, silver I think is something separate. But I think this geopolitical issue, this and this awareness of greater diversification benefits of gold is a good tailwind. Now at Davos, we also had a very memorable speech uh by Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada. It was actually a very well-received speech and I thought it was very insightful. Basically Carney is laying out that the world has changed, that we middle powers, we have to unite. If we're not at the table, we're on the menu. As he memorably said, it was uh very much uh not so subtly hinting that the US is behaving in kind of a hegemonic aggressive way, and that everyone else, if we don't stand up together, we're going to be taken advantage of, which is again, very, I thought, a very clear analysis of of what's happening in the political situation. However, though, it did elicit very poor reactions from the president who called him out, and also today he is announcing that he's going to put tariffs on Canada if they do a trade deal with China. Now, just as Mark Carney is talking about having a multi-polar world, being able to hedge relationships with other people, he also is acting on it by going to China last week, concluding a deal with China where Canada would sell canola oil to China, and in return, tariffs they have on Chinese EVs. Currently it's at 100% basically, uh, no Chinese EVs into Canada. That's changing now. There is a quota on this, and there is some domestic politics there. Ontario, where the car industry in Canada is is based, is upset about this. But it does show that Mark Carney really is diversifying his relationships, maybe building more better relationships uh not just with um like Europe, but with with China as well. Now, at the moment, Canada does do the bulk of its trade with the US. So it's very reasonable and sound to diversify those relationships. U, but that did make the president unhappy. His speech was very obviously targeted uh in a defying tone towards the president. And of course, we do have upcoming NAFTA renegotiations in somewhere, which looked like it was going to be difficult. Now, one other thing that when it comes to geopolitics, we have to keep in mind on is that there is increasingly risk, not just let's say in Latin America, which you saw Venezuela, but there's increasing reports that there are military assets being moved to the Middle East, and that looks like it's going to be something that that is going to keep a bid on gold. As if there is war in the Middle East, if the US does decide to strike Iran, as is periodically reported in big publications, uh, that's going to be a major tailwind for for for gold.

But looking at more traditional metrics, one other thing that happened last week, of course, was just as the sell America trade last year unwound with treasuries being bit again and equities rallying again. Um, last year though, the dollar did not really recover its big sell-off and had a pretty bad year last year. This week, something similar happened. The dollar uh also didn't have a good week. If you look at the dollar index, notable decline, and of course, weaker dollar gives upward pressure, upward tailwind to gold. Now, dollar has been declining against many currencies, but one currency it has not been declining against is the Japanese yen, until of course, this Friday.

So, secondly, let's talk about what happened in Japan the past week. So Japan, just for context, is in a very interesting situation. So inflation, it looks like it's around two, between two and 3%. So it's definitely at the BOJ's target. But on the other hand, the BOJ has kept interest rates very low. Even uh so, it's projected to continue to hike rates, but right now it's 0.75% on its policy rate. That is of course, a lot lower than say, 2 and 1.5% inflation. At the same time, it's running what many people perceive to be more stimulative fiscal policy. Now, the data suggests that the fiscal position of Japan is improving, but Prime Minister Takahi over there called snap elections, is trying to get a bigger majority in the legislature. And I think it's widely perceived that if she were to get more legislative power, she would try to run a more stimulative policy and potentially also have a little bit more say in how monetary policy is conducted. So you have the very much the prospect of some degree of fiscal dominance, and also um at a time where it doesn't seem like the economy is needs uh needs that. And so you have Japanese bond yields consistently rising. Now, to be clear, bond yields in Japan have been very low, and so for them to adjust to this, you know, two, 3% inflation regime, plus uh the prospect that this may continue, plus that BOJ may continue to hike as the market projects, is totally reasonable, but it is becoming a little bit disorderly in the long end of the Japanese bond. You had a huge, huge upward surge earlier in the week, and that probably played a role in impacting US assets as well, as US treasuries as well. Now, when you move further out into the curve, it's going to be less liquid, and so some kind of hiccup is to be expected. And so, towards the end of the week, we did see um some of that retrace. At the BOJ meeting, the BOJ officials also suggest that working with the uh fiscal authorities there to try to maybe do something. So, it seems like they're aware of this, but it doesn't seem like it's something that is uh kind of like a total panic. It really seems to me at least so far that it's the rate market adjusting from decades and decades of disinflation to basically a return to more of a normal 2 to 3% inflation, and potentially more as the population ages.

Now the flip side of course, with the BOJ keeping interest rates low, is that it also has been very negative for the currency. If you look at a chart for USD JPY, you can see that even as uh the United States dollar depreciated against many other currencies, it continues to appreciate against the yen, with the yen surging to around 160 yen to the dollar. Now, this has historically been a time where it's been a red line where Japanese authorities intervene. Um, part of it is because when you have very weak yen, that becomes a problem for um inflation in Japan, especially as they import a lot of stuff like crude oil. So inflation politically unpopular, the government does something. This time around though, um, it seems like this was also a red line. But also note that at the moment, with energy prices so low, analysts are thinking that, you know, this inflationary flow through from weak currency is not going to be as strong because oil is uh, you know, just around $60. Um, the BOJ did reportedly seem to intervene. What we saw in the yen market on Friday was that a discreet kind of uh appreciation in the yen, USD JPY go lower. Uh, but then that was, you know, just a little bit. What really, really seemed to kick in the buying in the end selling in US JPY was murmurs that there was a rate check by the New York Fed on Friday. And what that is is that the New York Fed, which is uh where the trading desk of the Fed is, was calling dealers, like when the Federal Reserve interacts with markets, they do it through the primary dealers, calling dealers and asking about, you know, where yen is trading and so forth. And so, um, that seemed to tip off to the market that maybe the Fed would intervene into the currency markets, since that's kind of what you would do, right? You would kind of see where the market is trading first. Now, the Fed does not have jurisdiction over currency policy. So, this is going to be on behalf of the Treasury. So, what it is, it's seeming like Secretary Bessend or whoever over there has had enough of this yen weakness and is doing something about it. And they could be doing this in coordination with the uh Japanese authorities. Maybe the Japanese authorities are thinking that, you know, our intervention really hasn't been super effective. After all, we only have so many foreign reserves. But if we have the US step in, the US has basically, you know, a dollar printing press. They can continue to sell dollars and buy yen, that is to say, strengthen the yen. Maybe that would be more authoritative. But in any case, this was very effective. And just the New York Fed on behalf of the Treasury, just making some phone calls, really had a big impact on the market. And it's telling everyone that it's not just the Japanese authorities are drawing this 160 uh USD JPY as a line in the sand, but the US Treasury is on board as well. And so I think historically speaking, um, you know, this sudden strengthening of the yen has been risk negative. And so it's be interesting to see what happens uh when markets open uh Sunday. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be a carry trade blow up. I mean, maybe people don't have uh heavy positions in that, but there are going to be people who are conditioned, maybe algorithms and so forth, to say that a strong yen is going to be riskoff. So I think that that's going to be interesting to see how that happens. Um, oh, one other thing, of course, is to note that uh the BOJ did in their meeting last week revise up their inflation forecast. So the market and again, continues to think the BOG will continue to hike, and that should strengthen the yen, but I think the problem is that they're approaching it too slowly, and you know, inflation is 2, 3%, policy rate is at 0.75, so they are by many metrics still pretty easy.

All right, so that's all I prepared for this week. Uh, this coming week, I believe is a Fed meeting. So I'll be back to talk to you about what I think uh happened at the Fed. Doesn't look like it's going to be much happening. Very, very boring is my guess. An interesting development in the Fed chair race is that now Rick Ryder of Black Rockck is now favored to be Fed chair. There were some positive comments that uh were whispered about him over the past week. So, we'll see how that happens. He has an interesting view on monetary policy. Uh, there are tweets that suggest he shares kind of an MMT view. So, maybe I write about that this week. All right. Talk to you all soon.

### 日本经济十字路口与日元干预

接着，我们转向日本的经济状况。日本目前正处于一个有趣的境地：通胀率维持在2%至3%之间，已达到日本央行（BOJ）的目标水平。然而，日本央行却持续维持极低的利率，其政策利率目前仅为0.75%，远低于通胀率。与此同时，日本政府似乎在推行更为扩张性的财政政策。数据显示，日本的财政状况正在改善，但首相**高桥**（Takahi，此处原文如此转写）为了争取更大的立法多数而提前举行大选。普遍认为，如果她获得更多立法权力，将可能推行更具刺激性的政策，并可能在货币政策的制定中拥有更大的话语权。这预示着财政主导（fiscal dominance）的可能性增加，尤其是在经济并不十分需要强力刺激的背景下。因此，日本国债收益率持续攀升。

需要明确的是，日本国债收益率长期处于低位，因此其向2%-3%的通胀环境调整，并考虑到未来可能持续的通胀以及日本央行可能如市场预期般继续加息，是合乎情理的。然而，日本国债的长期限市场正变得有些混乱。本周初，长期国债收益率出现了巨大的上行波动，这可能也影响了包括美国国债在内的美国资产。当收益率曲线进一步向远端延伸时，流动性会降低，出现一些波动是可以预期的。因此，在本周后期，我们确实看到了一些回撤。在日本央行会议上，官员们也表示将与财政当局合作，寻求解决方案。这表明他们意识到了问题，但似乎并未构成全面恐慌。至少目前看来，这更像是利率市场从数十年的通缩环境向更正常的2%-3%通胀水平回归的调整，并且随着人口老龄化，通胀可能还会进一步上升。

日本央行维持低利率的另一面是，这对日元汇率极为不利。观察美元兑日元（USD/JPY）的走势图可以发现，尽管美元兑许多其他货币都在贬值，但它却持续升值兑日元，日元一度跌至约160日元兑1美元。历史上，这通常是日本当局进行干预的“红线”。部分原因是，日元大幅贬值会加剧日本的通胀压力，特别是考虑到日本大量进口商品，如原油。因此，在政治上不受欢迎的通胀面前，政府会采取行动。然而，这一次，尽管也触及了“红线”，但由于当前能源价格较低，分析师认为日元疲软带来的通胀传导效应不会像以往那样强烈，因为油价仅在60美元左右。

日本央行据报道似乎进行了干预。周五日元市场的表现是，日元出现了一定程度的温和升值，美元兑日元汇率有所下降。但真正显著推动日元升值（即美元兑日元下跌）的，是市场传闻**纽约联邦储备银行**（New York Fed）在周五进行了“利率检查”（rate check）。所谓“利率检查”，是指美联储的交易部门所在地纽约联储，通过与一级交易商（primary dealers）联系，询问当前日元汇率的交易情况。这似乎向市场发出了信号，表明美联储可能将干预外汇市场，因为这是他们会采取的行动之一——首先了解市场交易状况。

需要注意的是，美联储本身并不直接拥有外汇政策的管辖权，因此任何干预都将代表**美国财政部**（US Treasury）的立场。这表明，**财政部长耶伦**（Secretary Yellen，此处原文为Bessend，推测为转写错误，但按要求保留原文）或财政部其他官员已对日元疲软感到厌倦，并正在采取行动。这种行动可能是与日本当局协调进行的。也许日本当局认为，自身的干预效果不佳，毕竟其外汇储备有限。但如果美国介入，凭借其“印钞机”的实力，可以持续卖出美元、买入日元，从而有效提振日元汇率，这可能更具权威性。无论如何，这次行动非常有效。仅仅是纽约联储代表财政部进行的一些电话沟通，就对市场产生了巨大影响。这向市场传递了一个信息：不仅是日本当局将160美元兑日元视为一条“红线”，美国财政部也对此表示支持。

从历史角度看，日元这种突然的升值往往被视为风险负面信号。因此，在周日市场开盘后，观察其动向将非常有趣。这并不一定意味着会发生“套息交易”（carry trade）的崩溃，但可能会有部分交易员或算法将日元走强视为风险规避（risk-off）的信号。因此，这将是一个值得关注的动态。

此外，值得注意的是，日本央行在其上周的会议上上调了通胀预测。市场因此继续认为日本央行将继续加息，这将有助于日元走强。但我认为问题在于，日本央行采取行动的速度过于缓慢。目前通胀率为2%-3%，而政策利率仅为0.75%，从多项指标来看，其货币政策仍相当宽松。
