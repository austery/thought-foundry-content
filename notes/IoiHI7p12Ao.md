title: The War on Slop
---

### 对抗低质内容（Slop）的战争

大家早上好！我希望你们今天都充满活力，因为我需要你们的支持。我有点紧张，但我们会一起度过。**今天，我在这里要宣布对“低质内容”（Slop）宣战。**

### 什么是 Slop？

我们先来讨论一下这个话题。每个 AI 工程师都有一个秘密。我已经和一些个人朋友分享过这个观点，我现在直接分享给大家。

- **第一届峰会**：我们知道 AI 工程师将会是一个重要的角色。
- **第二届峰会**：我们将范围扩展到领导层。
- **第三届峰会**：我们意识到必须集中精力在模型实验室，这也是为什么今天世界顶级的实验室都聚集在这里。

我们通过 AIPMs 和 AI 设计师扩大了 AI 工程的影响范围。通过代码峰会，我们开始关注精选主题。如果今年最重要的主题是“编码”，但我今天不专门谈论编码。你们在接下来的时间里会听到很多关于编码的内容。

所以，请大家给我 5 分钟时间来谈谈“低质内容”。

我们做得很好，对吧？就像大家认为的那样，我认为“低质内容”与数量和质量有关。我思考的问题是，我们如何发展这个社区、这个行业和这个活动，同时保持高质量？

这也是我们非常关心的问题。我们在座位安排和演讲者选择上投入了很多精力。

- **我们正在与“低质内容”作斗争**。这其实是牛津英语词典的内容，它甚至是 2024 年年度词汇的候选词，可惜输给了“脑腐”。

但我对牛津词典有一点小意见，因为他们说“低质内容”是通过人工智能生成的。

- **低质内容**：低质量、缺乏真实性或不准确的内容。
- **但 AI 不一定带来低质内容**：无论是人类还是 AI 都可能产生低质内容。

### 低质内容的例子

你应该自己也见过类似的情况。我想举几个例子。

- **互联网俚语**：低质内容的反义词是“kino”。我从 Paul Rambles 那里学到了这个概念。
  - 当我制作 Sora 视频时，我会和 Sam Holman 制作非常无聊的视频。
  - 而其他有创造力且擅长工作的人制作 Sora 视频时，会出现猫玩弄挖掘机的场景。

同一个工作室可以制作出不同的内容。Netflix 制作了 K-pop 恶魔猎人，也有 Electric ST。

- **不同模型**：Slop 可以由不同模型产生，不予评论。

Slop 可以退化为 SLO（低质内容），而 Kino 也可以退化为 SLO。**如果你是趋势的早期参与者，当它是新鲜和新的时，这很好。**

如果你认出另一张图片，说明你太过网络化了。

### 对抗低质内容的战争

[清嗓子] 好吧，关注的人不多。嗯，大家回去做作业吧。

显然，我会顺便嘲笑一下《权力的游戏》，因为这是一个类似的情况。**就像低质内容无处不在一样**。

它由人类和 AI 共同生成。你明白了吗？

[清嗓子]

好吧。**同样的创业理念可以是优秀的，也可以是低质的**。

当我在 AI 工程师峰会发表我的第一篇主题演讲时，我们实际上使用过一个 AI 幻灯片公司。

我加载了同一个幻灯片，但最近它关闭了，因为它实际上是一个低质的公司。

有关于“Vibe Coding”的不同看法，我认为其中一个比另一个要好得多。

我认为这些是我们必须应对的紧张关系之一。

我们的一位演讲者稍后也会提到这一点。

我认为 **这两张图都是指数图表，但一个感觉更真实，一个更像是低质内容**。我希望人们能研究一下为什么会出现这种情况。

总之，**我们处于非对称战争中，而“低质内容”**……

我认为 U 最接近的匹配法则是 **Brandolini 定律**，它实际上指出：

> 生产某物的能量需求比传播它所需的能量高一个数量级。

所以，我们需要创造一个合适的法律。

因为大家都知道，**生成 token 的成本每年都在下降 100 到 1000 倍**。

所以，这是 **Fix 的反低质内容定律**：

> 对抗 SLO（低质内容）所需的“品味”比生产它所需的品味高一个数量级。

外面有很多低质内容，我们需要提升世界上的内容，因为这就是人类所坚持的。

我认为有一个积极的信息：**你可以用 AI 来对抗低质内容**。

我很自豪能够运行一个名为 AI 新闻的副项目，它是唯一一个在没什么内容时告诉你不要阅读它的新闻通讯。

谢谢。哦，非常感谢。

你也可以**提示 SLO（低质内容）**。

下一位演讲者是 Mahash 和 Barry。

我发现他们在技能集中有一个提示，承认了低质内容并告诉云不要产生低质内容，结果确实显著改善。

### 代码低质内容

我们听说过代码如何创建技术债，两个工程师可以创造出相当于 50 个工程师的工作量。

或者说，在更严肃的情况下，你可以开始暴露数百万用户的私人数据。

所有我提到的内容都发生在今年。

我有点像用这个主题演讲来总结。

并且，**就像开玩笑一样**，即使有人说：

> “哦，我的模型可以自主运行 30 到 60 小时。”

听起来有点**低质**，因为你也没有说：

> “好吧，代码好不好？”

你只是在说它运行了多长时间。

所以，**就像没有代表权就不要征税一样，你也不想在没有责任感的情况下享有自主权**。

最近我一直在研究**用 AI 对抗代码低质内容**。

所以，这是来自一些人的引语：

> 半自动价值死亡，你可以在那里保持人类的注意力，并与机器融为一体，以便解决最难的问题。

而对于可以商品化的东西，你可以让它更异步。

你可以查看更多关于它的细节。

**被低估的是我的其他关于代码地图的工作**，我最近用 AI 完成了这项工作，以扩展基于代码的理解。

这也是对抗低质内容的一种方式。

你可以和楼下的认知团队交谈，他们可以向你展示更多细节。

最后一件事，我总是想提及的是**计算机使用趋势**。

我认为计算机使用在去年左右首次亮相，距今已经有一年了。

但它现在真的非常好。

它可以自主操作最复杂的应用程序，包括 ID。

所以，我认为这真的很令人兴奋，你们应该使用它来对抗低质内容。

我们用它来做网站，这里有一个例子，我们用 Devon 来自动化网站更新。

最后，**我昨天从这次会议上学到的东西**是：

你也可以使用**子代理**来对抗语境轮换。

而且，我认为这是我观察到的最大主题之一。

如果你们想从这次会议中获得一些收获……

我个人和 AIE 最大的亮点之一是与 Greg Brockman 聊天，他总是提倡**模块化的概念**。

你可以保持人类设计的清晰界限，让 AI 代码负责中间的一切。

所以，这些都是想法，但我只有一个信息，想压缩给大家：

**“不再低质（No More Slop）**”。

你的老板告诉你：

> “我希望在季度末前有更多代码。”

你怎么回答？**一起说：不再低质（No More Slop）。**

你在打一场**非对称战争**。情况很糟糕。

你有一个测试不足的版本，可能会让你的公司感到尴尬。

对于真的很想推进它的人，你会说什么？

> 不再低质（No More Slop）。就是这样。

你的推特算法想要参与博取注意力的诱饵，并迫使你对广大公众撒谎。

你会说什么？

> 就是这样。

我希望你们有一个很棒的会议，让我们为**不再低质（No More Slop）**而努力。谢谢。热烈欢迎！

morning.
 How's
 everyone
 doing?


>> Good.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 energy
 for


this
 talk,
 so
 please
 back
 me
 up.
 I'm


very
 nervous.
 Uh
 but
 we'll
 get
 through


this.
 I'm
 declaring
 war
 on
 slop
 today.


Let's
 talk
 about
 this.
 Every
 AIE
 has
 a


secret.
 I
 I've
 told
 this
 to
 uh
 some


folks
 that
 are
 personal
 friends
 and
 I'll


just
 show
 show
 the
 secret.
 Now
 the
 first


summit
 we
 had
 the
 secret
 which
 was
 we


knew
 that
 the
 AI
 engineer
 was
 going
 to


be a
 thing.
 Second
 summit
 we
 extended
 it


to
 leadership.
 Third
 summit
 we
 realized


that
 basically
 we
 always
 needed
 to


concentrate
 on
 model
 labs
 and
 that's
 why


you
 see
 um
 all
 all
 the
 all
 the
 top
 tier


labs
 here
 today
 um
 world's
 fair
 we


started
 expanding
 the
 TAM
 of
 of
 what
 AI


engineering
 uh
 is
 is
 affiliated
 with


with
 AIPMs
 and
 AI
 designers
 and
 with
 the


code
 summit
 as
 Jed
 just
 talked
 about
 we


really
 started
 focus
 on
 curation
 and


focusing
 in
 on
 a
 theme
 and
 if
 there's


one
 theme
 that's
 really
 matters
 this


year
 is
 it's
 coding
 but
 I'm
 not
 here
 to


talk
 about
 coding
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 day


you're
 going to
 hear
 about
 coding.
 So


just
 just
 indulge
 me
 5
 minutes
 to
 talk


about
 slop.


Um
 we
 we've
 done
 really
 well,
 right?


Like
 so
 so
 like
 I
 think
 like
 slop
 is


sort
 of
 associated
 with
 quantity
 and


quality.
 And
 I
 think
 like
 that's


something
 that
 I'm
 really
 trying
 to


think
 about
 as
 well
 like
 how
 do
 we
 grow


this
 community,
 grow
 this
 industry
 and


grow
 this
 event
 uh
 with
 the
 the
 same


kind
 of
 taste
 and
 high
 quality
 that


you've
 come
 to
 expect.
 And
 this
 is


something
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 hope


hopefully
 you
 guys
 can
 see
 that
 we
 care


a
 lot
 about
 uh
 in
 curating
 all
 of
 you


coming
 here
 and
 all
 of
 the
 speakers
 that


you're
 about
 to
 see.
 Um
 we're
 in
 a
 war


against
 slop.
 Um
 this
 is
 actually
 uh
 the


Oxford
 English
 dictionary.
 Uh
 this
 is
 a


a
 candidate
 for
 the
 2024
 word
 of
 the


year.
 It
 lost
 to
 brain
 rot.
 [laughter]


But
 um
 but
 slop
 is
 slop
 is
 pretty
 good.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 probably
 gone
 even


more
 of
 an
 issue
 this
 year
 than
 last


year.
 Maybe
 it
 will
 win
 this
 year.
 I


have
 an
 issue
 with
 Oxford
 though
 because


they
 did
 us
 dirty
 by
 saying
 slop
 is
 is


generated
 using
 artificial
 intelligence.


The
 other
 part
 I
 I
 agree
 with.
 It's


lowquality,
 inauthentic
 or
 inaccurate.


But
 it
 doesn't
 take
 AI
 to
 be
 lowquality,


inauthentic
 or
 inaccurate.


Any
 human
 or
 AI
 can
 be
 an
 agent
 of
 slop,


right?
 You've
 seen
 this
 yourself.
 I'm


going
 to
 indulge
 me
 over
 a
 few
 examples.


By
 the
 way,
 I
 got
 this
 uh
 if
 you're
 not


familiar
 with
 like
 sort
 of
 internet


slang,
 the
 opposite
 of
 slop
 is
 kino.
 Um


and
 I
 got
 this
 idea
 from
 Paul
 Rambles


who
 uh
 like
 you
 know
 when
 I
 do
 Sora


videos,
 I
 do
 really
 boring
 Sora
 videos


with
 me
 and
 Sam
 Holman.
 When
 other


people
 who
 are
 actually
 creative
 and


good
 at
 their
 job
 do
 Sora
 videos,
 they


do
 cats
 playing
 digs.


Uh
 slot
 can
 be
 produced
 by
 the
 same


studio.
 There's
 K-pop
 demon
 hunters
 by


Netflix
 and
 there's
 electric
 st
 by


Netflix.


Slav
 can
 be
 produced
 in
 terms
 of


different
 models.
 No
 comment.


Slav
 can
 be
 SLO
 can
 something
 that's


keyno
 can
 degenerate
 into
 SLO,
 right?
 If


you're
 early
 on
 the
 trend
 and
 you're
 and


you
 you're
 starting
 that
 and
 it's
 and


it's
 fresh
 and
 new
 and
 that's
 great.
 U


if
 you're
 if
 you
 recognize
 the
 other


image,
 you're
 too
 online.


[clears throat]
 Okay,
 not
 enough
 people


recognize
 that
 image.
 Um
 go
 do
 your


homework.
 Um
 yeah,
 and
 obviously
 I'm


just
 going to
 throw
 in
 a
 dig
 at
 Game
 of


Thrones
 because
 this
 is the
 same
 same


thing,
 right?
 Like
 slop
 is
 everywhere.


It's
 generated
 by
 humans
 and
 AI.
 You
 get


it?
 [clears throat]


Okay.
 Um
 the
 same
 startup
 idea
 can
 be


keen
 versus
 slop.
 When
 I
 first
 presented


the
 my
 first
 keynote
 at
 AI
 engineer


summit,
 we
 actually
 used
 to
 uh
 which
 is


sort
 of
 like
 an
 AI
 slides
 company.
 Uh
 I


loaded
 I
 loaded
 up
 the
 same
 slide
 deck


and
 it
 was
 gone
 uh
 recently
 because
 uh


it
 was
 it
 was
 actually
 uh
 sort
 of
 uh


closed
 as
 a
 company.
 Um
 there's
 there's


you
 know
 different
 takes
 on
 vibe
 coding


and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 them
 uh
 is
 much


better
 than
 the
 other
 and
 I
 think
 like


this
 these
 are
 just
 like
 the
 tensions


that
 we
 have
 to
 navigate.
 um
 one
 of
 our


speakers
 later
 on
 as
 well
 meter.
 Um
 I


think
 it's
 really
 interesting
 that
 both


of
 them
 are
 exponential
 charts
 but
 one


of
 them
 feels
 more
 keeno
 and
 the
 other


is
 more
 slops
 and
 I
 think
 like
 I
 would


really
 like
 to
 have
 people
 investigate


why
 um
 so
 let
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 skip


through
 basically
 we're
 in
 an
 asymmetric


war
 and
 slop
 um
 I
 think
 u
 the
 closest


law
 that
 I
 found
 that
 matches
 this
 is


Brandolini's
 law
 which
 actually
 states


the
 amount
 of
 energy
 needed
 to
 refuel


 is
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude
 bigger


than
 needed
 to
 produce
 it.
 Right.
 So
 we


need
 to
 co coin
 an
 appropriate
 law
 as


well.
 Um
 because
 you
 know
 like
 the
 the


the
 cost
 of
 generating
 tokens
 is
 is


dropping
 by
 100
 to
 a
 thousand
 times


every
 single
 year.


Um
 so
 this
 is
 I
 guess
 Fix's
 law
 of


anti-slav
 the
 amount
 of
 taste
 needed
 to


fight
 SLO
 is
 in
 order
 manually
 bigger


than
 that
 needed
 to
 produce
 it.
 Right?


There's
 so
 much
 low
 taste
 out
 there.
 We


need
 to
 elevate
 uh
 what's
 out
 there
 in


the
 world
 because
 that's
 what
 we
 stand


for
 as
 humans.
 Um,
 I
 think
 there's


there's
 a
 positive
 message.
 You
 can
 use


AI
 to
 fight
 slop.
 Um,
 I'm
 proud
 I'm


proud
 to
 run
 as
 a
 side
 project
 AI
 news,


which
 is
 the
 only
 newsletter
 that
 tells


you
 not
 to
 read
 it
 when
 there's
 nothing


going
 on.
 Thank
 [laughter]
 you.
 Oh,


appreciate
 that.
 Um,
 you
 can
 also
 prompt


SLO.
 The
 next
 speaker
 is
 um
 Mahash
 and


Barry.
 Um
 I
 found
 this
 in
 the
 in
 the


sort
 of
 prompt
 in
 the
 in
 the
 skill
 set


that
 they
 that
 they
 put
 they
 put
 where


they
 actually
 acknowledge
 slop
 and
 tell


cloud
 not
 to
 produce
 slop
 and
 it


actually
 improves
 significantly
 from


left
 to
 right.
 Um
 what
 about
 code
 slop


right
 we
 hear
 about
 code
 um
 creating


tech
 where
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 two
 engineers


can
 create
 a
 tech
 debt
 of
 50
 engineers


or
 you
 know
 on
 a
 more
 serious
 note
 you


can
 start
 exposing
 private
 data
 of


millions
 of
 users
 and
 this
 this
 all


happened
 this
 year.
 Everything
 I'm


mentioning
 all
 happened
 this
 year.
 I'm


kind
 of
 using
 this
 keynote
 as
 a
 as
 a
 way


of
 recapping.
 Um,
 and
 it,
 you
 know,
 just


to
 be
 spicy
 a
 little
 bit,
 even
 people


who
 are
 saying
 things
 like,
 "Oh,
 my


model
 can
 go
 up
 to
 30
 to
 60
 hours
 uh


autonomously."
 Well,
 it
 feels
 a
 bit


sloppy
 because
 you're
 also
 not
 saying,


"Well,
 was
 the
 code
 good
 or
 not?"
 You're


just
 saying
 how
 long
 it
 went.
 So,
 in
 the


same
 way
 that
 you
 have
 no
 taxation


without
 representation,
 you
 don't
 want


autonomy
 without
 accountability.


Um
 something
 I've
 been
 working
 on
 more


recently
 is
 that
 using
 AI
 to
 fight
 code


slop
 as
 well.
 So
 uh
 this
 is
 from
 the
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 quoted
 this
 yesterday
 of


the
 semi-ync
 value
 of
 death
 where
 you


can
 sort
 of
 keep
 human
 attention
 and


mind
 meld
 with
 the
 machine
 in
 order
 to


work
 on
 the
 hardest
 problems
 whereas
 the


stuff
 that's
 commoditized
 you
 can
 make


it
 more
 async.
 So
 you
 can
 check
 out
 more


on
 that
 details.
 What
 seems
 to
 be
 less


appreciated
 is
 my
 is
 the
 other
 work
 on


code
 maps
 uh
 which
 I
 which
 I
 more


recently
 done
 where
 we
 actually
 use
 AI


to
 scale
 codebased
 understanding
 which


is
 also
 a
 a
 way
 to
 fight
 slop
 and
 you


can
 uh
 talk
 to
 the
 cognition
 folks
 uh


downstairs
 uh
 um
 who
 who
 can
 who
 can


show
 you
 more
 in
 detail.
 Um
 the
 the
 last


thing
 I
 always
 want
 to
 shout
 out
 as
 well


is
 is
 this
 trend
 of
 uh
 computer
 use.
 I


think
 computer
 use
 kind
 of
 debuted
 it


this
 time
 last
 year
 uh
 with
 Enthropic.


But
 uh
 it's
 it's
 getting
 really
 really


good
 now
 guys.
 It
 can
 really


autonomously
 operate
 the
 most
 complex


apps
 including
 an
 ID.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


really
 uh
 exciting
 and
 you
 should


probably
 use
 that
 to
 fight
 slot.
 We
 use


it
 for
 the
 website
 and
 here's
 an
 example


of
 us
 using
 Devon
 to
 automate
 the
 the


sort
 of
 website
 up
 website
 updates.
 Um


and
 finally
 something
 I
 learned
 from


this
 conference
 yesterday
 is
 that
 you


can
 also
 use
 sub
 agents
 to
 fight
 context


rot.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 themes
 of
 of
 uh
 that
 I'm


observing
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 take


away
 something
 from
 this
 conference


um
 and
 I
 also
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


highlights
 of
 the
 year
 for
 us
 as
 AIE
 and


myself
 personally
 was
 chatting
 with
 Greg


Brockman
 who
 always
 uh
 preaches
 the


concept
 of
 modularity
 where
 you
 can
 sort


of
 keep
 clear
 boundaries
 on
 what
 is


human
 designed
 and
 let
 the
 AI
 code


everything
 in
 between.
 Um,
 so
 these
 are


all
 ideas,
 but
 I
 just
 have
 this
 one


message
 that
 I
 want
 to
 comp
 compress


down
 to
 you
 today
 that
 I
 want
 you
 to
 say


with
 me.
 No
 more
 slop.
 Yeah.


Your
 boss
 tells
 you,
 "I
 want
 more
 lines


of
 code
 in
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 quarter."


What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 that?
 Say
 it
 with
 me.


No
 more
 slop.


>> You're
 fighting
 an
 asymmetric
 war.
 This


is
 how
 bad
 it
 is,
 right?
 You
 have
 an


insufficiently
 tested
 release
 that
 that


is
 potentially
 embarrassing
 to
 your


company.
 What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 people
 who


really
 want
 to
 push
 it?


>> No
 more
 slop.
 Exactly.
 [laughter]


Uh
 your
 your
 Twitter
 algorithm
 wants


engagement
 bait
 uh
 and
 is
 sort
 of
 you


know
 forced
 and
 telling
 you
 to
 to
 to
 lie


basically
 to
 the
 to
 the
 broad
 public.


What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 that?


>> Exactly.
 That's
 it.
 Uh
 I
 hope
 you
 have
 a


great
 conference
 and
 let's
 let's
 hear
 it


for
 uh
 not
 having
 any
 more
 stuff.
 Thank


you.
 Heat. Heat.
 [applause]
