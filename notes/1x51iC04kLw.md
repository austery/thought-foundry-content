### 金钱：亲密关系中的“禁忌”话题

主持人安娜·马丁在节目中指出，金钱是亲密关系中一个难以启齿的话题。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. So, last week I talked to a woman who was so tired of doing that awkward dance at the end of a date. Should I pay? Should you pay? Should I pretend I want to pay? Should we split it? She was so sick of that that she asked a guy who she barely knew to open a joint bank account. That was a very unusual solution to a common problem. Money is so hard to talk about in relationships. Figuring out what to spend on, what to save for, who's in charge of making what decisions. It's tricky stuff.</p>
</details>

她提到上周采访的一位女士，厌倦了约会结束时关于谁买单的尴尬场面——是她付钱，还是他付钱，或者假装想付钱，又或者AA制？她对此深感厌倦，以至于让一个几乎不认识的男人开了一个联名银行账户。这虽然是一个非常规的解决方案，却反映了一个普遍问题：在亲密关系中，金钱问题总是难以启齿。决定花什么、存什么、谁负责做哪些决定，这些都非常棘手。

<p class="english-text">Recently, I asked you to tell me how money issues are showing up in your relationships. You sent us your stories. Thanks for that. And today we have someone here to help.</p>
</details>

最近，主持人向听众征集了他们在关系中遇到金钱问题的故事，并收到了许多反馈。今天，他们请来了一位专家提供帮助。

<p class="english-text">You might know Rammit Sati from his Netflix show how to get rich or his podcast money for couples. Ratit has a lot of practical advice for couples about how to be smart with money. But even before that he has to get them talking about money without fighting or crying or shutting down. And he does that by figuring out what money means to them emotionally. So today we're meet Sati on how to have a money conversation that actually feels good. He answers your questions and talks about what it takes to live a rich life, whatever rich means to you.</p>
</details>

这位专家就是拉米特·塞西（Ramit Sethi），他因Netflix节目《如何致富》（How to Get Rich）和播客《夫妻理财》（Money for Couples）而广为人知。塞西为夫妻提供了许多关于如何明智理财的实用建议。但在此之前，他首先要帮助他们学会如何在不争吵、不哭泣、不逃避的情况下谈论金钱。他通过了解金钱对他们情感上的意义来做到这一点。因此，今天塞西将分享如何进行一次真正愉快的金钱对话，他会回答听众的问题，并探讨如何过上“富裕生活”，无论“富裕”对你意味着什么。

### 金钱对话为何如此艰难？

Ramit Sethi在节目中解释了金钱对话为何如此困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if you think about how we treat money, especially in America, it's actually no surprise. Parents rarely talk about it to their kids. The only phrase that they typically use ever is, "We can't afford it."</p>
</details>

他指出，如果我们审视人们对待金钱的方式，尤其是在美国，金钱对话的难度就不足为奇了。父母很少与孩子谈论金钱，他们通常只会说一句：“我们买不起。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as you grow up, where do you learn about money? From movies, from TV shows, maybe. It's like we create this tapestry and we put this story and that uncle and that aunt, etc. But we rarely have a structured understanding about money.</p>
</details>

长大后，我们从哪里学习金钱知识呢？可能来自电影、电视节目。我们就像编织了一幅挂毯，把各种故事、这位叔叔、那位阿姨的经历都放进去，但我们很少对金钱有结构化的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then just think about the terms that we hear around us. 401k. I can't think of a more confusing term that's a turnoff. When someone said Roth IRA, I'm like, who's Roth? Yeah, exactly. Totally.</p>
</details>

再想想我们周围听到的那些术语，比如**401k**（401k: 美国雇主赞助的退休储蓄计划）。他想不出一个比这更令人困惑、更让人望而却步的词了。当有人提到**Roth IRA**（Roth IRA: 一种退休储蓄账户，缴费是税后的，未来取款免税）时，他会想：“罗斯是谁？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So imagine this. You go to be 25, 35, 40, whatever the number is, and maybe you get into some kind of relationship. You yourself rarely have a point of view on money. Like most of us have a point of view on food. We know what type of food we like or what type of food makes us feel good. We don't have the point of view on money though. Then you partner up with somebody who equally does not have a point of view and suddenly we don't even know what we're actually talking about.</p>
</details>

想象一下，当你到了25、35、40岁或任何年龄，可能进入了一段关系。你自己对金钱很少有明确的看法。就像我们大多数人对食物有看法一样，我们知道自己喜欢什么类型的食物，或者什么食物让我们感觉良好。但我们对金钱却没有这样的看法。然后你和同样没有明确金钱观的人走到一起，突然间，我们甚至不知道自己在谈论什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a very difficult way to go through life. Almost like you're wearing smudged glasses. So everything you look at is a little confusing maybe a little tinged with scarcity. And that is why so many people I end up eventually maybe making more than they ever thought. They still feel behind with money. Why? Cuz it's not about the numbers. It is about the way that you feel when it comes to money.</p>
</details>

这是一种非常艰难的生活方式，就像戴着模糊的眼镜。你看到的一切都有些模糊，可能还带有一丝匮乏感。这就是为什么很多人最终可能赚的钱比他们想象的要多，但仍然觉得自己在金钱方面落后了。为什么？因为这无关乎数字，而是你对金钱的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you, let's say, you get into a relationship, get married, start building a future with someone who has their own smudged glasses on. And this creates even more of a problem.</p>
</details>

然后，假设你进入一段关系，结婚，开始与一个同样戴着模糊眼镜的人共建未来，这会带来更多问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. because you're usually not speaking about the money itself. So, one of the most typical disagreements that I will see when I speak to couples on my podcast is one person disagrees with how much the other spends at Target for whatever reason. It's always Target. Like I'm like, "Please, can we not do this again?" And you know, if I can just be very honest with you, your rich life has got to be bigger than Target. Your rich life has got to be bigger than buying a freaking Tide detergent and other commodities. There's got to be and I like Target, but it's got to be more than that. Okay, the other the other disagreement is</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi观察到，夫妻之间的争执通常不是关于金钱本身。他播客中夫妻最常见的争执之一是，一方对另一方在Target超市的消费金额不满。他开玩笑说：“拜托，我们能不能别再吵这个了？”他坦言，一个人的“富裕生活”必须超越Target超市，超越购买汰渍洗衣粉等日用品。虽然他喜欢Target，但生活必须有更深层的意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why does my partner go to the gas station and buy energy drinks every day? This is outrageous. And you know, I I recall this Instagram DM I got from somebody based in New York who said, "Reit, can you speak to my husband because he wastes money every day he buys an iced tea? Why is there such a disagreement about the iced tea? It is not about the iced tea. It is two different people looking at it two different ways. One person saying, "Hey, I earn a lot of money. I work hard. I'm going to get an iced tea. It's a nice little break in the middle of the day." The other saying, "When I grew up, we did not get iced tea. We made it at home." And those different visions of money, the couples rarely go into that level of detail. How did I grow up? How do I see money? What is our vision together? Instead, they spend 35 years arguing about iced tea.</p>
</details>

另一个常见的争执是：“为什么我的伴侣每天都要去加油站买能量饮料？这太离谱了！”Ramit Sethi回忆起一条来自纽约的Instagram私信，对方说：“Ramit，你能和我丈夫谈谈吗？他每天都浪费钱买冰茶。”他反问，为什么冰茶会引起如此大的分歧？这并非冰茶本身的问题，而是两个人以不同的方式看待它。一方可能说：“我赚了很多钱，工作很辛苦，买杯冰茶是午间很好的放松。”另一方则说：“我小时候，我们不买冰茶，都是在家自己做。”夫妻很少深入探讨这些不同的金钱观念，比如“我是如何长大的？”“我如何看待金钱？”“我们共同的愿景是什么？”相反，他们却为一杯冰茶争论了35年。

### 缺乏共同的“富裕生活愿景”

Ramit Sethi指出，亲密关系中金钱问题的最常见症结在于，缺乏一个共同的“富裕生活愿景”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's take a step back just for folks who aren't familiar with this concept. You speak about it a lot. What is a rich life?</p>
</details>

主持人请他解释“富裕生活”的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A rich life can be traveling two months a year. A rich life can be buying a beautiful cashmere coat. A rich life can be taking your kids to school every morning. So your rich life is yours and my rich life is mine and they are going to be completely different.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi解释说，“富裕生活”可以是一年旅行两个月，可以是一件漂亮的羊绒大衣，也可以是每天早上送孩子上学。因此，你的富裕生活是你的，我的富裕生活是我的，它们会完全不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very rarely do we elevate ourselves and ask the big questions. Hey, what is all this for? What kind of life are we building together?</p>
</details>

我们很少提升自己的视角，去问那些宏大的问题：“这一切是为了什么？我们正在共同建设怎样的生活？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that could be tangible. Sometimes it like when I was a kid, we could not afford to buy appetizers. We never did. Like it was just like a taboo part of the menu in the once every six weeks that we ate out. Right. And so part of my rich life in my early 20s was to be able to order appetizers.</p>
</details>

这种愿景可以是具体的。他回忆说，小时候家里买不起开胃菜，每六周出去吃一次饭，开胃菜就像菜单上的禁忌。因此，在他20岁出头时，他“富裕生活”的一部分就是能够点开胃菜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Now when it comes to you andor your partner, these are the kind of questions that I really want you to start by asking. What is our rich life? And they could be inexpensive. They could be quite luxurious. But we start with the vision and then we use the money to try to get there. I love this and it's it's like I want to return to this example of the tea because it does feel so, you know, universal. We all have a a tea in our life, right? The person who's buying tea or maybe we're the person buying tea. So, how would we apply the concept of a rich life to addressing that conflict?</p>
</details>

他建议，你和你的伴侣应该从问这些问题开始：“我们的富裕生活是什么？”这些愿景可以不昂贵，也可以非常奢侈。但我们首先要设定愿景，然后利用金钱去实现它。主持人很喜欢这个想法，并希望回到冰茶的例子，因为这感觉非常普遍。我们生活中都有自己的“冰茶”，无论是买冰茶的人，还是我们自己就是买冰茶的人。那么，如何将“富裕生活”的概念应用于解决这种冲突呢？

### 从贬低到好奇：DTOC原则

Ramit Sethi提出了一个名为**DTOC原则**（DTOC原则: Disparagement to Curiosity，从贬低到好奇的沟通原则）的沟通方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. First, I I want to suggest a principle called the DTOC principle. And this stands for disparagement to curiosity. Instead of saying why do you do that? That's such a waste of money. Saying like, "Hey, can you tell me about that? I noticed you love it every day." And I just love to know like where do you go when you buy it? What do you feel? Like what does it mean to you? And you might be so surprised that there are so many things to learn about your partner even after 25 years of marriage by going to this level of curiosity.</p>
</details>

首先，他建议采用DTOC原则。这意味着从“贬低”转向“好奇”。不要说“你为什么那样做？那是在浪费钱！”而是说：“嘿，你能告诉我那件事吗？我注意到你每天都很喜欢它。”他想知道你买的时候去了哪里？你有什么感受？它对你意味着什么？通过这种好奇心，即使结婚25年，你也会惊讶地发现关于伴侣的许多新事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have never been genuinely asked out of curiosity not judgment about our money. Whenever someone asks us about money, they're about to judge us. Oh, how much did that handbag cost? Oh, why did you get that car? And we know we're going to get judged. So, we start to shrink. But what we're doing is recalibrating. When I ask somebody, hey, um, it turns out you love to travel 6 months a year. I go, that sounds awesome. Where do you go? How do you stay in shape? What kind of food do you eat? And I am genuinely curious. And that's why people open up.</p>
</details>

我们从未真正被好奇地（而非评判地）问及金钱问题。每当有人问我们金钱，他们往往准备评判我们：“哦，那个手提包多少钱？”“哦，你为什么买那辆车？”我们知道自己会被评判，所以会退缩。但DTOC原则是在重新校准。当他问某人：“嘿，你好像喜欢一年旅行六个月。”他会说：“那听起来太棒了。你去哪里？你是如何保持身材的？你吃什么食物？”他是真心好奇，这就是人们敞开心扉的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Let me ask you this. like would the goal be to get this person to stop spending money on the tea or what what's the goal of this kind of conversation?</p>
</details>

主持人问道，这种对话的目标是让对方停止在冰茶上花钱，还是别的什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe maybe it turns out you actually cannot afford it. So by asking the questions of what it means, you can ultimately both together navigate to finding another way to accomplish that goal. That's one possibility. Another possibility is that you have more money than uh iced tea will ever affect. And so it actually is about connecting on a deeper, more emotional level and then going and looking at the numbers and realizing like we could buy 10 iced tea a day and it will affect us zero.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi回答说，也许最终发现你确实负担不起。通过询问其意义，你们可以共同找到实现目标的另一种方式。这是一种可能性。另一种可能性是，你们的钱多到冰茶根本不会产生任何影响。这样，对话就变成了在更深层次的情感上建立连接，然后审视数字，意识到即使每天买10杯冰茶，也丝毫不会影响你们的财务状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Y'all should go get iced tea together. How sweet would that be? Beautiful.</p>
</details>

主持人建议：“你们应该一起去买冰茶，那会多甜蜜啊！”Ramit Sethi赞同道：“太棒了。”

### Ramit Sethi的金钱观：从童年经历到婚前协议

主持人注意到Ramit Sethi对金钱充满热情，并请他分享塑造其金钱观的成长经历。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My parents are huge role models in the way that I look at the world. And um they're immigrants from India and when they came here, you know, they did not have a lot of money. My dad worked, my mom stayed home with us. We have a pretty big family. And I remember lots of little things that really shaped my world. I remember my mom would cook dinner for us every night and we would almost never eat out. Like I'm talking once every 6 weeks when we had a coupon to go to pizza. And those restaurants were really uh memorable for us because one like just getting to eat out was awesome, but it was a big deal. You know, we we would ask our dad for two quarters to play the arcades, but not more than that. Like that's too much. Um, and we knew kind of like what was on limits and what was off limits. And I actually really appreciate</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi表示，他的父母是他看待世界的巨大榜样。他们是来自印度的移民，刚来美国时并没有多少钱。父亲工作，母亲在家照顾他们。他们家人口众多。他回忆起许多塑造他世界观的小细节：母亲每晚为他们做饭，他们几乎从不在外面吃饭，大约每六周才用优惠券去吃一次披萨。这些外出就餐的经历对他们来说非常难忘，因为能出去吃饭本身就很棒，而且意义重大。他们会向父亲要两个25美分硬币去玩街机，但不能再多，因为那太多了。他们清楚什么可以做，什么不可以做。他非常感激这些经历。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Appetizers, desserts. I have to admit I don't I shouldn't admit this. We would order like two Cokes for our entire family and like share them, you know? I mean, we would water down the lemonade. I totally feel you. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's how exactly. Watering down everything, right? Oh, the shampoo's running out. Put some water in it. Boom.</p>
</details>

主持人问还有什么是不允许的，他补充道：“开胃菜、甜点。”他甚至承认，他们全家会只点两杯可乐然后分享。主持人表示理解，说他们也会稀释柠檬水。Ramit Sethi笑着说：“对，就是这样，什么都稀释，对吧？洗发水快用完了，加点水进去，搞定！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're also painting a picture of an incredibly happy childhood. I mean, you tell me, but it sounds, you know, overall very warm and beautiful. Like, what did those experiences, what did they teach you about what money was for or what its value was?</p>
</details>

主持人评论说，他描绘了一个非常幸福的童年，听起来温暖而美好。她问这些经历教会了他金钱的用途或价值是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, my my dad um told me something a few years ago that really it led me on to the fact that he had a a vision that I was not aware of. M so we're talking about a house and he said you know one day when you buy a house don't get too big of a house and I said why I just thought like we didn't have that big of a house cuz we couldn't afford it. That's the reason. And he goes yes okay you know we bought what we could but if you have too big of a house kids go into their own corner and they don't congregate. But if you have a small house everybody gets together and that's how you build a family.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi分享说，几年前父亲告诉他一件事，让他意识到父亲有一个他从未察觉的愿景。当时他们谈论房子，父亲说：“有一天你买房子，不要买太大的。”他问为什么，因为他一直以为他们家房子不大是因为买不起。父亲说：“是的，我们买了我们能买得起的，但如果你房子太大，孩子们就会各自躲在自己的角落，不会聚在一起。但如果房子小，大家就会聚在一起，这就是你建立家庭的方式。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. I thought to myself, like, wow, my dad did the most advanced possible thing you can do, which is turn a weakness into a strength. And the fact that we couldn't buy some mansion, like we didn't care. We're just kids. But actually, we ended up spending a ton of time together. And I'm still very close to my siblings and my parents. And so that is a rich life. Notice that it's not an abundance of money. It's actually working with what you got, but having a beautiful vision, which my dad only kind of recently led me into.</p>
</details>

他当时想：“哇，我父亲做了你能做的最先进的事情，就是把弱点变成优势。”他们买不起豪宅，但他们是孩子，并不在意。实际上，他们因此花了很多时间在一起。他至今仍与兄弟姐妹和父母关系非常亲近。这就是一种“富裕生活”。这并非金钱的充裕，而是利用你所拥有的，并拥有一个美好的愿景，而这个愿景是父亲最近才让他领悟到的。

<p class="english-text">When you met your wife, Cassandra, I'm curious where you were in terms of your relationship to money. Um, and really actually I think the more interesting question is, do you remember the first time money came up with Cassandra early on in your relationship?</p>
</details>

主持人问Ramit Sethi，他遇到妻子卡桑德拉（Cassandra）时，他对金钱的态度如何，以及他是否记得在关系早期第一次与卡桑德拉谈论金钱的情景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a great question. Well, I met her in New York. We were both living in New York. And I met her at a barbecue. And I remember it vividly because she had a huge smile, like a um unusually beautiful big smile. A I love just um how vibrant and positive she was. And it's funny because on our first date, we went to the East Village and we went to this um Mexican cocktail bar and I accidentally spilled an entire glass of water on her, like a whole glass. And I I still remember her reaction. She just laughed and I was like, "Oh my god." Like that kind of positivity that was so attractive, so appealing. And so, you know, we began dating seriously and I think probably money came up the first couple of times like when we took a trip, which is actually quite common for couples, you know, like that's the first time you really talk about money and and so there's that. But I think when it became like really serious, when we substantively talked about money was um when we got engaged and we started discussing a prenup and that really changed everything. M bring me into that.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi回忆说，他在纽约的一个烧烤派对上认识了卡桑德拉，当时两人都住在纽约。他清楚地记得她灿烂的笑容，以及她充满活力和积极乐观的个性。第一次约会时，他们去了东村的一家墨西哥鸡尾酒吧，他不小心把一整杯水洒在了她身上。他至今仍记得她的反应——她只是笑了。那种积极的态度非常吸引人。他们开始认真约会后，金钱问题可能在他们第一次旅行时就出现了，这在情侣中很常见，通常是第一次真正谈论金钱的时候。但当关系变得真正认真，他们实质性地谈论金钱，是在他们订婚并开始讨论**婚前协议**（Prenup: Prenuptial Agreement，婚前协议，约定婚姻破裂时财产分配）的时候，那彻底改变了一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I don't know anyone growing up who had a prenup. Me neither. And I thought it was cultural, but it was also probably socioeconomic. I just didn't know people who were wealthy. And you know, as as you grow in business, you know, folks, and there's a lot of tacit knowledge that's passed down. And so it's like, hey, what is a prenup? Well, most of us when we think about a prenup, we think it's some rich who's trying to screw over their partner. you know, they're driving outside of a limousine, they throw some papers out, say, "Sign this shit." I'm like, "That's not a pre that's actually just a Richie Rich episode. That's not like a prenup." So, I learned how it works. And I was like, "Oh, this is basically talking about what happens with your pre-marital assets, the stuff that you might have before you get married. So, let's say one partner owns a house or another has a business. M you kind of want to decide in the worst case of separation what would happen to those assets that were acquired before the marriage knowing that in almost all cases anything acquired during the marriage is split.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi表示，他成长过程中不认识任何签过婚前协议的人。他原以为这与文化有关，但可能也与社会经济地位有关，他只是不认识富裕的人。随着他在商业上的成长，他了解到许多隐性知识。他解释说，大多数人想到婚前协议时，会觉得是某个富人试图欺骗伴侣，就像电影里富豪从豪华轿车里扔出文件说“签了这个”。他说那不是真正的婚前协议，那只是《小富翁里奇》的剧情。他了解了婚前协议的运作方式后，意识到它主要是关于婚前资产的处理，即你在结婚前可能拥有的东西。例如，一方拥有一套房子，另一方拥有一家企业。在最坏的情况下，即分居时，你希望决定这些婚前资产如何处理，因为几乎所有情况下，婚姻期间获得的资产都会被分割。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I remember we sat down and I'm like my hands are freaking shaking and I said to her you know I have something that's really important to me. You know I've built up this business and this portfolio and it's important for me that we discuss a prenup. And why were you nervous? What were you nervous that she would perceive that as?</p>
</details>

他回忆说，他们坐下来谈论时，他的手都在颤抖。他对卡桑德拉说：“你知道，我有一些对我来说非常重要的东西。我建立了这家公司和这个投资组合，对我来说，我们讨论一份婚前协议很重要。”主持人问他为什么紧张，担心她会如何看待这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These conversations are so filled with like secondary meanings. So I was worried about rejection. I was worried about being misinterpreted. I was just worried about it all. I'd never done it before.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi说，这类对话充满了次要含义，他担心被拒绝，担心被误解，担心所有的一切，因为他从未做过这种事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So her response was actually the best response I could have possibly hoped for. She said, "Okay, I didn't expect that. I don't know much about it, but I'm willing to learn."</p>
</details>

卡桑德拉的反应是他所能期望的最好回应。她说：“好吧，我没想到。我对这个不太了解，但我愿意学习。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great. Yeah. Disparagement to curiosity. Disparagement to curiosity. There you go. Uh-huh.</p>
</details>

主持人称赞道：“太棒了。是的，从贬低到好奇。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was the beginning of us actually meeting as to what money meant to us. It's not just numbers. It's actually what it means to us. for people who are avoiding these types of conversations or frankly are scared to have them because I think that's a legitimate emotion like what would you say to give them courage?</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi说，这标志着他们真正开始探讨金钱对他们的意义，而不仅仅是数字。对于那些回避或害怕进行这类对话的人，他会如何鼓励他们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm I'm actually going to tell them exactly what to say and I will call this this is from my book called your first positive money conversation. And I use that term on purpose because most of us actually have never had a positive money conversation. we've only bered or judged or had that happen to us. So, in a positive money conversation, you go to your partner, you say, "Hey, I actually want to talk to you more about money and I want to feel good about it. I want us to feel connected."</p>
</details>

他表示，他会告诉他们具体该说什么。这来自他书中提到的“第一次积极的金钱对话”概念。他特意使用这个词，因为我们大多数人从未有过积极的金钱对话，只有抱怨、评判或被评判。因此，在一次积极的金钱对话中，你应该对伴侣说：“嘿，我其实想和你多聊聊金钱，我希望我们能对此感觉良好，我希望我们能感到彼此连接。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's part one of the conversation. Just tell them why it's going to be awesome. That's it. Then next, you say, you know, right now when I think about money, I feel um scared. I feel in the dark and I feel behind. How about you?</p>
</details>

这是对话的第一部分，只需告诉他们为什么这次对话会很棒。然后，第二步，你说：“你知道吗，现在当我想到金钱时，我感到……害怕。我感觉一无所知，而且落后了。你呢？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, notice what you're doing. You're leading with vulnerability and then you're tossing them the ball. This is not a monologue. You want them involved. And if they don't have an answer, that's okay. You don't have to push it, but you're giving them an opportunity.</p>
</details>

他指出，这样做是先示弱，然后把球抛给对方。这不是独白，你希望他们参与进来。如果他们没有答案，也没关系，不必强求，但你给了他们一个机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Third, you say, you know, when it comes to money, I want to feel competent. I want to feel calm, and I want to feel connected. How about you? And then the fourth point is just when should we talk about money next?</p>
</details>

第三步，你说：“你知道吗，谈到金钱，我希望自己能感到有能力、平静和连接。你呢？”第四点是：“我们下次什么时候再谈金钱？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it. Give each other a big old kiss and call it a day. We don't need to get into your freaking asset allocation on meeting one. All you got to do is give each other a hug and feel good. That's it.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi总结道，就这样。给彼此一个大大的吻，结束这一天。第一次见面不需要深入讨论资产配置。你们只需要拥抱彼此，感觉良好，仅此而已。

### 听众问答：金钱与亲密关系中的挑战

主持人强调，进入金钱对话的关键在于以感受和脆弱性开场，这与许多听众的问题息息相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um here is our first advice seeker. This one is from a woman named Michelle. Okay. So you asked about finances and this argument literally happened last week. I have been talking about opening a Roth IRA for my partner because I had done one over a year ago. So, this last week, I wanted to set one up for him and it turned into an argument because he said I'm treating him like a baby and that this was something he can do. So, I explained that I had brought this up a couple times and he never once tried to do it on his own and I don't understand what the problem is because this is bettering our future or even his future if we ever split up because we aren't married. So, it would be his money. But anyway, it's just been very frustrating and now it's like it's been a week. Do I bring it up again? Do I just leave it alone?</p>
</details>

第一位寻求建议的听众是米歇尔（Michelle）。她提到，上周她和伴侣因为财务问题发生了争执。她一直建议伴侣开设一个**Roth IRA**（Roth IRA: 一种退休储蓄账户，缴费是税后的，未来取款免税），因为她自己一年多前就开了一个。上周她想帮他设置，结果却演变成争吵，因为他说她把他当小孩，这是他自己能做的事。米歇尔解释说她已经提过好几次，但他从未尝试自己做，她不明白问题出在哪里，因为这会改善他们共同的未来，即使他们分手，也会改善他自己的未来，因为他们没有结婚，那笔钱将是他的。总之，这让她非常沮丧。现在一周过去了，她不知道是该再次提起，还是干脆算了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very common and I am so glad that we get to talk about this because there are layers here. The most common response people will often have is like, well, you just got to show them the numbers and show them the math and blah blah blah. Math is not going to solve an emotional problem. I wish I could go back in time and tell 22-year-old Ramit Sati that. I wish I could hear that myself. But that will not move the needle. I can also hear some really interesting um context from Michelle. Michelle says a year ago I opened my Roth IRA and now I'm telling him why don't you open your Roth and it'll be good for us etc. But if we are really candid, if I had come to Michelle 3 years ago and said, "Michelle, why don't you open up a Roth IRA?" You know what she would have said? "Nah, I don't know. It's fine. Whatever."</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi表示，这个问题非常普遍，他很高兴能讨论，因为它涉及多个层面。人们最常见的反应是：“你只需要给他们看数字和算术就行了。”但他强调，数学无法解决情感问题。他希望自己能回到过去告诉22岁的自己这一点。但那并不能改变现状。他还从米歇尔的话中听出了一些有趣的背景。米歇尔说她一年前开了自己的Roth IRA，现在告诉伴侣为什么不也开一个，这对他们都有好处。但如果坦诚地说，如果三年前他对米歇尔说：“米歇尔，你为什么不开一个Roth IRA？”她可能会说：“不，我不知道。没关系。随便吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is so common that when one person goes through a process of self-development, whether it's relationships, fitness, money, we then turn to our partner who has not gone through the same journey and we expect them to meet us where we are. That's not how it works.</p>
</details>

他指出，这很常见：当一个人经历了自我发展的过程，无论是在人际关系、健身还是金钱方面，我们就会转向尚未经历同样旅程的伴侣，并期望他们能达到我们现在的水平。但事情并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a really good point. That's where compassion comes in and systems. So, here's here's what I want to point out. I guarantee that the two of the them do not have a shared vision for a rich life. And candidly, she's probably right. Like, technically, he probably should open up a Roth IRA. It's an amazing account. But just going in there is like the equivalent of me, you know, jumping in and saying like, "You need to get new shoelaces." Like, why? What's the context here? like why is a shoelace fixed my and also shoelace is a lot of work and I don't even know where to get a shoelace okay I probably from the way that she's talking I suspect there's probably a bit of parent child dynamic I hear that a lot in couples that I speak to you'll often find one partner who will take on the role of a parent like you need to do this and then guess what the child kind of avoids it so we have a chaser avoider dynamic as well the more they avoid the more you chase and this becomes quite toxic over time.</p>
</details>

主持人认为这是一个很好的观点，涉及到同情心和系统。Ramit Sethi指出，他敢肯定他们两人没有共同的“富裕生活愿景”。坦率地说，米歇尔可能说得对，从技术上讲，她的伴侣确实应该开设一个Roth IRA，那是一个很棒的账户。但直接介入，就像他跳出来说：“你需要换新鞋带了。”为什么？背景是什么？为什么鞋带能解决我的问题？而且换鞋带很麻烦，我甚至不知道去哪里买鞋带。他从米歇尔的谈话方式中，怀疑这可能存在一种“父母-孩子”的动态关系，他在与夫妻交流时经常听到这种模式：一方扮演父母的角色，说“你需要做这个”，而另一方则像孩子一样回避。这形成了一种“追逐者-回避者”的动态：对方越回避，你就越追逐，随着时间的推移，这会变得相当有害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therapists deal with this all the time. This is why I recommend my guests see a therapist. It's very, very helpful. But overall, I think that what I would suggest to Michelle is zoom out. Do that first money conversation. Get a little buy in. Realize you don't have to solve everything on the first meeting. This this might actually take 9 months. It might even take 12. But when he is bought in um it is going to be smooth because you will not have to be the convincer that the two of you will actually be doing it as a team. And um so start there. Start with the vision. Ask what what is our rich life? What do we see our life being? How does money fit in? Maybe we should read a book together and learn how this works. Can I do chapter 1? You do chapter two. And then work your way towards a Roth IRA and more.</p>
</details>

治疗师经常处理这类问题，这也是他建议来宾去看治疗师的原因，这非常有帮助。但总的来说，他建议米歇尔放宽视野，进行第一次金钱对话，获得一些认同。要意识到不必在第一次谈话中解决所有问题，这可能需要9个月，甚至12个月。但当他真正参与进来时，事情就会顺利得多，因为你就不必再扮演说服者的角色，你们两人将作为一个团队来共同完成。所以，从那里开始，从愿景开始。问：“我们的富裕生活是什么？我们希望我们的生活是怎样的？金钱在其中扮演什么角色？也许我们可以一起读一本书，学习如何理财。我读第一章，你读第二章。”然后逐步走向Roth IRA及更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess my sort of final question on this is like how much how involved is too involved in a partner's finances?</p>
</details>

主持人问，在伴侣的财务问题上，过度介入的界限在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Excellent question. For somebody like Michelle, one thing that I want to encourage her to do is to set your expectations. What do you expect from a partner? For example, if if I'm dating, I might say, "Look, I expect that any partner that I'm dating saves and invests at least 10%." That's just important to me. That's a value thing to me. And for Michelle, it might be I expect that a partner that I'm dating is investing X amount for their retirement.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi认为这是一个很好的问题。对于像米歇尔这样的人，他鼓励她设定自己的期望。你对伴侣有什么期望？例如，如果他在约会，他可能会说：“看，我期望我约会的任何伴侣至少储蓄和投资10%。”这对他来说很重要，是一种价值观。对于米歇尔来说，这可能是：“我期望我约会的伴侣为他们的退休投资X金额。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you're not telling them you're bad or you need to do this, but like this is what I expect from a partner of mine. What do you think about that?</p>
</details>

你不是在告诉他们“你很糟糕”或者“你需要这样做”，而是说“这是我对我的伴侣的期望”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's interesting. It's like a first step for Michelle here is introspection for herself and then you laid out a a good road map of a compassionate sort of curious and long-term discussion that she and her partner partner can start having about sort of what does the future look like for us? Roth IRA included or Roth IRA not included.</p>
</details>

主持人认为这很有趣，米歇尔的第一步是自我反省，然后Ramit Sethi为她和伴侣描绘了一幅富有同情心、好奇且长期的讨论路线图，关于“我们的未来会是怎样？”无论是否包括Roth IRA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the question is really not about a Roth IRA. The goal is to live a rich life together.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi强调，问题并非Roth IRA本身，目标是共同过上富裕的生活。

### 收入差异与沟通策略

第二位寻求建议的听众是L。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, Modern Love. I have been dating someone very seriously for the past 2 years and we are both in our 60s. Ever since day one, because I'm very independent and I can afford my own way, I've always paid for myself. It would be so nice if one night when we're out to dinner, he picked up the check, but he absolutely never does. He has recently gone through a terrible divorce. It was like War of the Roses because they were both very wealthy. And I feel like he has some PTSD maybe where he does not want to spend money on another female.</p>
</details>

L说，她和男友已经认真约会两年了，两人都60多岁。从一开始，因为她非常独立，经济上能自给自足，所以她总是自己付钱。她很希望有一天晚上出去吃饭时，他能买单，但他从来没有这样做过。他最近经历了一场可怕的离婚，就像《玫瑰战争》一样，因为他们双方都非常富有。L觉得他可能因此患上了**创伤后应激障碍**（PTSD: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder），不愿再为其他女性花钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would love some advice on how I can bring this up to him or do I just continue paying half?</p>
</details>

她想知道如何向他提起这件事，或者是否应该继续AA制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. A lot there. I mean, I I wonder we did this earlier. I wonder if you could like script almost a way for L to bring it up or or another way into this conversation.</p>
</details>

主持人请Ramit Sethi为L提供一个沟通脚本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, first off, L sounds lovely and um this sounds like a very reasonable request. I didn't hear anything unreasonable from that. She said, "We split it. I would like for him to pick up the check occasionally." That seems exceedingly reasonable to me. How to bring it up, particularly with his divorce can be a little tricky. So, what I might say is I let's for ease of use, let's just call him John.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi首先表示，L听起来很可爱，她的要求非常合理。她希望男友偶尔买单，这在他看来非常合理。但考虑到他刚经历离婚，如何提出会有些棘手。他建议，为了方便，称她的男友为约翰（John）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, John, I just wanted to let you know that I love spending time with you and one of my highlights is when we go out to eat every weekend and I just wanted to have a conversation with you about a topic that might seem uncomfortable, money. And I know until now we have split and that is perfectly fine with me. I, as you know, I'm independent. I'm happy to do it. But it's also important to me that as we go through life more, as we become closer, that we think about what a partnership looks like, a team. And if I can just be really honest, once in a while, it would be nice if you picked up the check. How do you think about that? How does that strike you? So, let's pause right there. A couple of things. That may not be the perfect conversation, but you can adapt it for your needs. L couple of things I want to highlight that I did there for everybody listening. One is I always start with an appreciation. This is a little tip that I learned from my own therapist. Start with an appreciation. Hey, I love being able to talk to you about money. Two, acknowledge that you want to talk about something that might be a little uncomfortable. And give them an out. Give them an out. say, "Hey, if this if this doesn't feel like the right time to talk, let me know. We'll talk about it in a few days. No problem." And then three, just ask for what you want. This is so important. I find this to be a very very I I talked to couples who've been married 22 years and I they're dancing around it, walking on eggshells. I go, "Have you ever asked them what you want?" And they go, "Not that directly." I go, "Not directly at all. Why don't you ask right now?" And they do for the first time in 20 years.</p>
</details>

他建议L可以这样说：“约翰，我想让你知道，我喜欢和你在一起的时光，我们每个周末出去吃饭是我最开心的时刻之一。我想和你谈谈一个可能不太舒服的话题——金钱。我知道到目前为止我们一直是AA制，我完全没问题。如你所知，我经济独立，也很乐意这样做。但对我来说，随着我们关系越来越深入，越来越亲密，思考一下伴侣关系，一个团队，应该是什么样子也很重要。如果我能坦诚地说，偶尔由你来买单会很棒。你觉得呢？你对此有什么看法？”Ramit Sethi强调了几点：首先，总是以感谢开场，这是他从自己的治疗师那里学到的小技巧。例如，“嘿，我很高兴能和你谈论金钱。”其次，承认你想谈论一个可能不太舒服的话题，并给对方一个退路，说：“嘿，如果现在不是合适的时机，告诉我。我们几天后再谈，没问题。”第三，直接提出你想要什么。这非常重要。他发现很多结婚22年的夫妻都在这个问题上小心翼翼、回避不谈。他会问：“你有没有直接问过他们你想要什么？”他们会说：“没有那么直接。”他会说：“根本不直接。为什么不现在就问？”然后他们会这样做，这是20年来的第一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's incredible. There is so much power in number one being rooted in yourself and saying look it's okay for me to want this. They don't have to give it to me but at least I can ask and then for your partner to listen and hopefully if they are reasonable they might react as Cassandra did and say hey like I don't know anything about that but I'm willing to learn. That's a great answer. Or they might say you know what I never thought about it like that. Like would you mind if I think about it a bit more but I I love you. I would love, of course, I would love to pick up the tab once in a while. That's another way.</p>
</details>

主持人认为这令人难以置信，首先要立足于自身，说“我想要这个没关系。他们不必给我，但至少我可以提出来。”然后伴侣倾听，如果他们是理性的，他们可能会像卡桑德拉那样回应，说“嘿，我对此一无所知，但我愿意学习。”这是一个很好的答案。或者他们可能会说：“你知道吗，我从未那样想过。你介意我再考虑一下吗？但我爱你。我当然乐意偶尔买单。”这是另一种可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another thing that we that was later on in this um voicemail we couldn't play at all is L told us that her boyfriend makes a lot more money than she does. Several times more. Does that change your thinking about this question at all? Is that or or is that something you Yeah. Okay. 100%. What the hell? How did I not get that bit of intel? All right. Now, we need to adapt things a little bit. Okay. Um things change when there are income differences, particularly when you are not married. So I'll give you an example. Um when Cassandra and I were dating, I was making more money. If I asked her to go 50/50 on some trip or something that we were going to take, that would have been totally unfair because I made more than her. It would have financially drowned her. That's not fair. So one thing that I recommend is to go proportional. Again, if you make three times more, you pay three times more for the joint expenses. I probably wouldn't do that on like dinner out. That's just a bit weird and overly transactional.</p>
</details>

主持人补充说，L在语音邮件中提到，她的男友收入比她高很多倍。她问这是否会改变Ramit Sethi的建议。Ramit Sethi立刻说：“百分之百会！我怎么没得到这个信息？好吧，现在我们需要做一些调整。”他解释说，当存在收入差异时，尤其是在未婚的情况下，情况会发生变化。他举例说，他和卡桑德拉约会时，他赚得更多。如果他要求她在旅行或其他共同开销上AA制，那将非常不公平，因为他赚得比她多，这会在经济上压垮她。这不公平。所以他建议按比例分摊。如果你的收入是对方的三倍，那么你在共同开销上就应该支付三倍。不过，他可能不会在每次外出就餐时都这样做，那会显得有点奇怪和过于计较。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there are so many different ways to apply that. One, you could both say, "Hey, we're going to we're each going to put um put in some money to eat out every month. How much do we think we eat out? Let's just make the math easy. $100 per month." So, the person earning three times more puts in three times more towards that $100, right? Uh, and then whoever wants to physically pick up the check that time could.</p>
</details>

但有很多不同的方法可以应用这个原则。例如，你们可以都说：“嘿，我们每个月都要拿出一部分钱用于外出就餐。我们觉得我们每个月外出就餐的费用是多少？为了方便计算，假设每月100美元。”那么，收入是对方三倍的人就应该为这100美元投入三倍的钱，对吗？然后，谁想实际买单都可以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, in terms of L though, I just want to be clear before we move on. So, it's like the fact that he makes so much more. How would that change the conversation that you suggested to her initially? Would it change it?</p>
</details>

主持人追问，对于L的情况，男友收入高很多这一事实，会如何改变他最初建议的对话方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, I think it would. And I think that this takes some delicacy. Um, but it could be done. So, you know, number one, same thing. Start with an appreciation. Hey, I really appreciate and I love that we can go out, etc. I want us to be a team. um when it comes to us going out to eat and like just for example who pays how do you think about that and he's going to say well you know fine with me it's working and she'll say you know I agree that until now it has worked and again I really love our time together I can't help but notice that you know you make a lot more than I do and so what's 50% to me is a lot higher than what's 50% to you now I'm not here to nitpick over your income. That's yours. But what I really want to try to do with the two of us is to build a partnership together. And for me, a partnership does not make as much sense if we're doing 50/50 when the income is so different. Um, I also think that this might be a candidate for if they already see a therapist. This is a fantastic opportunity to bring this up in therapy because a skilled facilitator can certainly help with this one.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi认为会改变，并且需要一些技巧，但可以做到。第一步仍然是表达感谢：“嘿，我真的很感激也很喜欢我们能一起出去等等。我希望我们是一个团队。”然后谈到外出就餐，比如谁来付钱，他怎么看？他可能会说：“嗯，我觉得没问题，现在这样挺好。”L可以回应：“我知道到目前为止一直都很好，我也很喜欢我们在一起的时光。但我不得不注意到你的收入比我高很多，所以对我来说的50%比对你来说的50%要高得多。我不是来挑剔你的收入，那是你的。但我真正想和我们两个人一起做的是建立一种伙伴关系。对我来说，如果收入差异如此之大，还坚持AA制，这种伙伴关系就没有太大意义。”他还建议，如果他们已经有治疗师，这是一个绝佳的机会在治疗中提出这个问题，因为一位经验丰富的引导者肯定能提供帮助。

### 应对隐瞒债务与购房压力

第三位听众是塞丽卡（Celica）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My boyfriend was really clear at the beginning of our relationship that financial security was really important to him. And a year and a half into our relationship, my boyfriend found out that I had been lying about having $18,000 in credit card debt. I remember crying because I knew that I had broken trust and I expected us to be over right then and there. And he stopped and he said, "This is what we're going to do." And he came up with a plan to take care of my debt. And it was a very difficult year, but we managed to pay off my credit cards in that year. And after July, I will be debtree. The problems that we're facing now are we are in our late 20s. We're almost 30 and we are desperately trying to save our money to get a house. and I'm stressed out and upset because I feel like we're behind because of me and he does a great job at not putting the blame on me, but I know that he is not where he wanted to be at this point in his life.</p>
</details>

塞丽卡说，她的男友在他们关系开始时就明确表示，财务安全对他非常重要。然而，在他们交往一年半后，男友发现她一直在撒谎，她有18,000美元的信用卡债务。她记得自己当时哭了，因为她知道自己破坏了信任，以为他们的关系会就此结束。但男友停下来，说：“我们要这样做。”他提出了一个偿还她债务的计划。那是非常艰难的一年，但他们在那一年里成功还清了她的信用卡债务。今年七月之后，她将彻底摆脱债务。他们现在面临的问题是，他们都快30岁了，正拼命存钱买房。她感到压力和沮丧，因为她觉得他们因为自己而落后了。男友很棒，没有把责任归咎于她，但她知道男友现在的生活状况并非他所期望的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel like there's a lot there, but yeah, I'm curious your immediate reactions to that. Um, well, first I just have to recognize the the beautiful way that love shows up with money. I mean, no, I don't think she should have hidden the debt, I think that's a very tough and bad decision in relationships, but the way that her boyfriend stepped up is pretty amazing. And the way that the two of them went through it is quite a quite impressive.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi首先表示，他必须承认爱在金钱问题上展现出的美好方式。他认为她不应该隐瞒债务，那在关系中是一个非常艰难和糟糕的决定，但她男友挺身而出的方式令人惊叹。他们两人共同度过难关的方式也令人印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">people having debt is one of the things that makes people feel the most ashamed. And Celica, my suggestion for you is that you are more than guilt. You can be somebody who has learned from a bad decision in the past. You do not have to go through the rest of your life atoning for it. You can actually build something beautiful and connective with your boyfriend. And most importantly, you can actually accept that you are more than this one thing that you did in your life. You are so much more than that.</p>
</details>

他指出，负债是让人感到最羞愧的事情之一。他对塞丽卡的建议是：你不仅仅是内疚。你可以成为一个从过去的错误决定中吸取教训的人。你不必余生都在为此赎罪。你实际上可以和男友一起建立一些美好而有连接感的东西。最重要的是，你实际上可以接受你不仅仅是你生活中做过的这一件事。你远不止于此。

<p class="english-text">The solution is to take a step back, zoom out, ask each other, what is our rich life? What's our vision? If we want to buy a house, why? How long do we plan to stay there? What are the numbers?</p>
</details>

解决方案是退后一步，放宽视野，问彼此：“我们的富裕生活是什么？我们的愿景是什么？如果我们想买房，为什么？我们计划在那里住多久？数字是多少？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ooh, you're about to get me riled up on this one. So, I just want to point out some phrases I heard. Um, desperately, we desperately want to buy a house. We are stressed. We are behind. And there is blame. Notice those words. They are what I call hot emotions. They're very hot. like there's a fire. And with money, I want us to bring it down. I want these emotions to be cool, calm, and collected. That is how we want to relate to money. Okay? We do not want to be making hot decisions. Ah, I hate my life. It's so bad. No. Cool. Even if you have credit card debt, you can be cool about it. My debt payoff date is February 2032. Cool.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi指出，他听到了一些词语，如“拼命地”、“我们拼命想买房”、“我们压力很大”、“我们落后了”，以及“责备”。他称这些为“炽热的情绪”，就像火一样。他希望在金钱问题上，我们能把情绪降温，让它们变得冷静、沉着、镇定。这才是我们对待金钱的方式。我们不希望在情绪激动时做决定，比如“啊，我讨厌我的生活，太糟糕了。”不，要冷静。即使有信用卡债务，你也可以冷静对待。比如：“我的债务还清日期是2032年2月。很酷。”

<p class="english-text">I'm going to say something that might surprise a lot of listeners, which is sometimes buying a house may not be the right financial decision. I think this is a really interesting sort of tenant of yours. Speak on that. Why?</p>
</details>

主持人提到，Ramit Sethi有一个可能让许多听众惊讶的观点：有时买房可能不是正确的财务决定。她请他解释原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In America, our primary religion is home ownership. And you can tell it's religious because people don't use actual logic. They use trit little phrases like you're throwing money away on rent or why would you want to pay your landlord's mortgage? It's interesting that we don't use the same phrases when we go eat sushi. Oh, you're throwing money away on sushi. You're paying your sushi owner's mortgage. Why do I care? I'm getting good sushi and they're doing my dishes for me. It's great. But when it comes to home ownership, we genuinely believe that you the only way to create real wealth is to buy a house. And if we don't buy a house, we're a loser. I will share something quite surprising, which is that I have rented, my wife and I have rented, and I've personally rented for over 20 years. And I've made more money renting than I would have owning. A lot more.</p>

Ramit Sethi说，在美国，我们的主要“宗教”是房屋所有权。你可以看出它是宗教性的，因为人们不使用实际逻辑，而是使用一些陈词滥调，比如“你在浪费钱付房租”或者“你为什么要替房东还房贷？”有趣的是，我们吃寿司时不会说同样的话：“哦，你在浪费钱吃寿司，你在替寿司店老板还房贷。”他反问：“我为什么要关心？我吃到了好寿司，他们还帮我洗碗，这很棒。”但谈到房屋所有权，我们真心相信创造真正财富的唯一途径就是买房。如果我们不买房，我们就是失败者。他分享了一个令人惊讶的事实：他和妻子一直租房住，他个人租房超过20年。而且，他通过租房赚的钱比买房赚的钱多得多。

<p class="english-text">so sometimes renting and investing the difference can be a better decision than buying a house. The key principle here is you have to carefully run the numbers. You can run what's called a **买房与租房计算器** (Buy vs. Rent Calculator: 比较购房和租房财务成本的工具). Actually the New York Times has a fantastic calculator which I would highly recommend and you will discover for example in Manhattan just as a very obvious example it actually makes no financial sense to buy. Same thing in Menllo Park or in um Athetherton very expensive PaloAlto but also now in cities like Seattle and even other cities. In fact, it is cheaper to rent than to buy in 100% of the top 50 US metro cities right now.</p>

因此，有时租房并将差额投资，可能比买房是更好的决定。这里的关键原则是，你必须仔细计算数字。你可以使用**买房与租房计算器**（Buy vs. Rent Calculator: 比较购房和租房财务成本的工具）。实际上，《纽约时报》有一个很棒的计算器，他强烈推荐。你会发现，例如在曼哈顿，买房在财务上是完全不划算的。门洛帕克、阿瑟顿、非常昂贵的帕洛阿尔托也是如此，现在西雅图甚至其他城市也是一样。事实上，目前在美国前50大都市区中，100%的城市租房都比买房便宜。

<p class="english-text">So why am I sharing this with you? I need you to take the biggest financial decision of your life seriously. I need you to actually run the calculations. You need to understand what an **摊销表** (Amortization table: 显示贷款本金和利息随时间偿还情况的表格) looks like. You need to understand that your total cost of ownership should be primarily less than 28% of gross, but maybe up to 32 or 33. If you don't know what any of those words mean, you're not ready to buy a house.</p>
</details>

他分享这些是为了让听众认真对待人生中最大的财务决定。他希望他们实际进行计算，了解**摊销表**（Amortization table: 显示贷款本金和利息随时间偿还情况的表格）是什么样子。他们需要明白，总拥有成本应主要低于总收入的28%，但可能最高可达32%或33%。如果这些词语的意思你都不懂，那么你还没有准备好买房。

### 储蓄者与消费者：遗产规划的冲突

第四位听众是斯图尔特（Stuart）。

<p class="english-text">My wife and I have been fighting bitterly over the last few years about money, but this is about money in terms of estate planning. We're in our young 70s. We're relatively healthy and we have a lot of energy. My wife wants to spend as much money as is possible. Now, while we can enjoy it, I fear that we might outlive our money knowing the catastrophically high cost of long-term care. Uh, also, I want to be able to uh leave as much as possible to our three children. I have this fantasy that they're going to be in Paris uh uncing a bottle of champagne, enjoying fura, and toasting us. Thank you.</p>
</details>

斯图尔特说，他和妻子在过去几年里因为金钱问题争吵不休，但这次是关于遗产规划。他们都70出头，身体相对健康，精力充沛。他的妻子想尽可能多地花钱，趁现在还能享受。但他担心他们可能会花光所有的钱，因为长期护理的费用非常高昂。此外，他还想尽可能多地留给他们的三个孩子。他有一个幻想，希望孩子们能在巴黎开香槟，享受美食，并为他们祝酒。

<p class="english-text">What do you think about this? This is not the only voicemail we got of this sort where there is, and I imagine you also get this question a lot, a couple who has these polar opposite approaches to money, the spender versus the saver. What's your input there?</p>
</details>

主持人问Ramit Sethi对此有何看法，因为他们收到了许多类似的语音留言，夫妻双方对金钱的态度截然相反，一方是消费者，一方是储蓄者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it's very common and I speak to many couples where one has been future oriented for decades. We need to save and typically it goes like this. We need to save enough to get a house. They buy. We need to save enough to do the basement. We need to save enough to send the kids to school. Now, we need to save to send them to college. And meanwhile, the saver is typically accumulating quite a bit of money. It starts to become a little bit absurd. Like, what about actually living for today?</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi表示，这种情况非常普遍。他与许多夫妻交流过，其中一方几十年来一直着眼未来：“我们需要存钱。”通常是这样：需要存足够的钱买房，然后他们买了。需要存足够的钱装修地下室。需要存足够的钱送孩子上学。现在，需要存钱送他们上大学。与此同时，储蓄者通常积累了相当多的钱。这开始变得有点荒谬，比如：“那今天的生活呢？”

<p class="english-text">And this is why my work is called I will teach you to be rich. It's not called I will teach you to hoard money in a high yield savings account. The point of money is not to save it. The point of money is to use it to live a rich life. Part of that involves saving and investing diligently. I agree. But part of it involves building the skill of spending money. And that is something that I would be willing to bet most listeners have not worked on.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么他的作品名为《我将教你致富》，而不是《我将教你把钱囤积在高收益储蓄账户里》。金钱的目的不是储蓄，而是用它来过上富裕的生活。其中一部分确实包括勤奋储蓄和投资，他同意。但另一部分则包括培养花钱的技能。他敢打赌，大多数听众都没有在这方面下功夫。

<p class="english-text">So there's there's three real skills. The first skill when it comes to money is earning money. That's your career, your job, that kind of thing. Most people, they're decent at it. You know, they think about it a lot. Okay, cool. The next skill is managing your money. That is saving and investing and setting up the right structures and accounts. Yeah, I think some people are pretty good at this. They spend some time on it. The third skill is the skill of spending money meaningfully. And almost nobody does this. Now to Stuart's question.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi指出，金钱方面有三种真正的技能。第一种是赚钱，这与你的职业、工作等有关。大多数人在这方面还不错，他们会花很多心思。第二种是管理金钱，即储蓄、投资以及建立正确的结构和账户。他认为有些人在这方面做得很好，他们会花时间学习。第三种技能是“有意义地花钱”的技能。几乎没有人做到这一点。现在回到斯图尔特的问题。

<p class="english-text">I do agree that you should be planning and know that you're not going to run out of money. But I want to also point out that I also consider it a tragedy to end your life with way too much money, having never built the skill of spending it. And in fact, Stuart says, "I have a dream of my three kids popping champagne in Paris." Hey, Stuart, why don't you take your kids to Paris? What are you talking about? you you want to be looking down from heaven. Take them with you. Take them with you and show them what it's like to have spent a lifetime working and saving and now to be able to share this with your loved ones. And while you're there, Stuart, take your wife on a little trip and tell her, "Babe, I love you. And yes, I know that I want to save money and sometimes I might be a little bit in the spreadsheets, but that's because I love you. But I'm also listening and I know that it is our time to experience these things around the world. That is why I brought the kids here and that's why I'm also spending time just you and me.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi同意应该进行规划，确保不会花光钱。但他同时指出，如果一个人一生积累了太多金钱，却从未培养花钱的技能，那也是一种悲剧。斯图尔特说他梦想着三个孩子在巴黎开香槟。Ramit Sethi反问：“嘿，斯图尔特，你为什么不带你的孩子去巴黎呢？你在说什么？你想从天堂俯瞰吗？带他们一起去！带他们一起去，让他们看看一生努力工作和储蓄后，现在能够与所爱之人分享这一切是怎样的体验。当你身处巴黎时，斯图尔特，也带你的妻子去旅行，告诉她：‘宝贝，我爱你。是的，我知道我想存钱，有时我可能有点沉迷于电子表格，但那是因为我爱你。但我也在倾听，我知道现在是我们去体验世界各地这些事物的时候了。这就是我带孩子们来的原因，也是我只和你在一起的原因。’”

<p class="english-text">That is really quite full circle to me actually because we started off with that example of the guy who's buying the tease and we said one thing that they could do is buy the tease together. And I really like that suggestion. Stuart, take the kids and why not stop at that. You and your wife go on a wonderful trip to a place that you've wanted to go to. Do that together. Be connected.</p>
</details>

主持人认为这形成了一个很好的闭环，他们从买冰茶的例子开始，当时建议他们可以一起买冰茶。她很喜欢这个建议。她对斯图尔特说：“带孩子们去，为什么不就此止步呢？你和你的妻子去一个你们一直想去的美妙地方旅行。一起去做，保持连接。”

<p class="english-text">Stuart, send us a picture. This is the kind of stuff I love is seeing couples using their money and creating these magical experiences. Life is not a rich life is not lived in a spreadsheet.</p>
</details>

Ramit Sethi请斯图尔特给他们寄一张照片。他喜欢看到夫妻用金钱创造这些神奇的体验。他说：“生活不是，富裕生活不是活在电子表格里的。”

### 总结：金钱与情感的连接

主持人总结道，Ramit Sethi对这些脆弱问题的回应令人感到非常安心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is so important for all of us to understand. You know what I will also say, Reie, before we head to the close, is like the way that you respond to these questions that are deeply vulnerable is incredibly soothing because you're able to say with real sincerity like this is normal or I've seen this or yes, here's a plan, here's a script. and the kind of black box that finances, money and emotions can become like I find your approach very calming which is and and grounded and connected.</p>
</details>

她认为，Ramit Sethi对这些极度脆弱问题的回应非常抚慰人心，因为他能真诚地说：“这很正常，我见过这种情况，是的，这里有一个计划，这里有一个脚本。”在财务、金钱和情感可能变成的“黑箱”中，她觉得他的方法非常平静、扎实且富有连接感。
