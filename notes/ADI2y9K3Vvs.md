### 亚马逊财报解读与个人持仓复盘

近期亚马逊（AMZN）的财报表现引发市场震荡，股价在短时间内大幅下跌，从最高点至今已累计下跌超过22.54%。这引发了关于公司是否已显颓势、巨额资本支出（CAPEX）是否拖垮公司的疑问。本期视频将从最新财报、基本面、竞争环境及护城河等多个维度，对亚马逊进行深入分析。

作为一名亚马逊的长期持有者，我已持有该股票1331天。回顾我的个人仓位表现，复合年化回报率为10.61%，显著低于同期标普500指数基金ETF的20.28%。而在我的家庭信托账户中，亚马逊仓位占总持仓的近90%，该账户的年化回报率为-4.97%，很大程度上受到汇率波动的影响，尤其是近期美元的下跌侵蚀了部分回报。同期标普500 ETF的年化回报率为12.60%。这些数据表明，在过去一段时间内，我的亚马逊持仓表现并未跑赢大盘。这不禁让人思考：我买亚马逊是否彻底失败了？在**大语言模型（Large Language Model: 基于海量文本训练的AI系统）**时代，亚马逊是否还有未来？要解答这些问题，我们必须从公司最新的财报数据入手。

Today's video is about Amazon, stock ticker AMZN.
Amazon's latest earnings report was a complete disaster, wasn't it?
The stock price plummeted by 16.14% in 2 days.
It has fallen 22.54% from its peak in 3 months.
Is Amazon finished?
Is its massive CAPEX dragging the company down?
In today's video, we will take a detailed look at Amazon from multiple aspects including the company's latest financial report, latest fundamentals, competitive environment, and its moat.
I have held Amazon for 1331 days.
As usual, let's start with my holdings and their performance.
This chart shows my personal portfolio performance.
My compounded annual return over these years is 10.61%.
If I had bought the S&P 500 index fund ETF during the same period,
my annualized rate would have been 20.28%.
Clearly, my Amazon position has not outperformed the market.
Let's look at this chart, which shows the performance of my family trust.
The Amazon position in the family trust
accounts for nearly 90% of my total Amazon holdings.
So you can basically understand that this chart
truly reflects my Amazon holdings performance.
We see that over the years I've held it, my annualized return on Amazon is -4.97%.
A large part of this is due to exchange rates.
We see that because the dollar has recently plummeted,
this has directly led to significant losses in returns due to exchange rates.
During the same period, if I had held the S&P 500 index ETF,
my annualized rate would have been 12.60%.
Clearly, in this trading account, my Amazon position has not outperformed the market.
Did I completely fail in buying Amazon?
Does Amazon still have a future in the era of Big AI?
To answer these questions, we still need to start by analyzing the company's
latest financial report in detail.

### 业务结构分析与AWS的强劲表现

根据我为大家总结的亚马逊最新季度商业结构分析，这些数据均由管理层在财报中披露，因此具有100%的精准度。

首先，亚马逊北美业务本季度营收为1270亿美元，同比增长10%。毛利显著增长，毛利率达到9.03%。这表明亚马逊北美业务的效率正在提升，单季度1300亿美元的营收若未来能达到两位数的毛利率，将非常令人期待。该业务目前占总营收的59.56%，接近六成。

其次是亚马逊的国际业务，最新营收为507.2亿美元，同比增长17%，增长速度相对较快。然而，本季度毛利率仅为2.05%，这反映了电商业务普遍存在的极低毛利率特征。该业务占总营收的23.77%。

最后，也是最亮眼的业务——亚马逊AWS云服务。最新季度营收为355.8亿美元，同比增长24%，这一增长率相当出色。毛利率高达35.03%，占总营收的16.67%。无论是增长率还是利润率，AWS都是亚马逊目前表现最佳的业务。

总体而言，仅从本季度的财报表现来看，亚马逊是相当出色的。AWS的快速增长（同比增长24%）是关键驱动力。此外，亚马逊正积极布局电力供应，管理层提到过去12个月公司增加了3.9吉瓦（Gigawatt）的电容量，并预计到2027年将再次翻倍。这表明亚马逊已意识到，除了算力之外，电能也可能是AI发展的另一瓶颈，公司正在积极布局电能设施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

This is the Amazon's latest quarterly business structure analysis I've summarized for you.
The data here has been disclosed by management in the earnings report,
so the data is 100% accurate.
We see that Amazon's North America business revenue for this quarter was $127 billion, a year-on-year increase of 10%.
Gross profit increased significantly this quarter, with a gross margin of 9.03%.
Amazon's North America business seems to be becoming more efficient.
And with quarterly revenue of $130 billion,
if it can reach double-digit gross margins in the future, it's quite exciting.
This business currently accounts for 59.56% of total revenue, approximately 60%.
Next is Amazon's international business.
The latest revenue for this business was $50.72 billion, a year-on-year increase of 17%.
The growth is actually quite fast.
The gross margin this quarter was 2.05%*.
Frankly, I think this gross margin is very poor, which is a very typical characteristic reflecting the extremely low gross margin of e-commerce.
It accounts for 23.77% of total revenue.
Next up is Amazon's AWS cloud services business, AWS.
The latest quarterly revenue was $35.58 billion, a year-on-year increase of 24%.
Honestly, this growth is quite outstanding, with a gross margin of 35.03%.
It accounts for 16.67% of total revenue.
This business is the best performing business in terms of both growth rate and profit margin.
Honestly, just looking at Amazon's financial report performance this quarter,
it's quite outstanding.
Firstly, AWS is growing rapidly, with a current year-on-year growth of 24%.
Secondly, Amazon is also actively deploying power supply.
Management mentioned that in the past 12 months, the company has added 3.9 Gigawatts of power capacity
and expects to double it again by 2027.
Clearly, Amazon has realized that besides computing power,
electricity is another bottleneck for AI development.
Amazon is now actively deploying power infrastructure.

### AI基础设施投入与自研芯片战略

管理层还提到，亚马逊自研芯片**Trainium 2**（一种用于AI训练的芯片）已开始大规模部署，并显著提升了数据中心的能效。这反映了一个普遍趋势：在阅读了各大公司的财报后，我们能看到AI巨头们都在专注于自研芯片，以稀释**英伟达（Nvidia）**芯片的不可替代性，毕竟英伟达的芯片价格不菲。

更令人瞩目的是，管理层预计到2025年，资本支出（CAPEX）将达到1300亿美元，并预计在2026年超过2000亿美元。这笔巨额资金主要用于搭建AI基础设施。2000亿美元的CAPEX已远远超出普通人的认知范围。试想一下，全球有多少公司一年能投入2000亿美元进行资本投入？恐怕一只手就能数过来。这表明亚马逊正以前所未有的规模投入AI基础设施建设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Management also mentioned that Amazon's self-developed chip, **Trainium 2**, has begun large-scale deployment and has significantly increased data center energy efficiency.
This reflects a general trend: after reading the financial reports of major companies, we can see that AI giants are all focusing on self-developed chips to dilute the indispensability of **Nvidia's** chips, as Nvidia's chips are quite expensive.
What's more noteworthy is that management expects capital expenditure (CAPEX) to reach $130 billion by 2025, and projects it to exceed $200 billion in 2026.
This massive amount of capital is primarily for building AI infrastructure.
$200 billion in CAPEX is far beyond the comprehension of ordinary people.
Imagine, how many companies worldwide can invest $200 billion in capital expenditure in a year?
You could probably count them on one hand.
This indicates that Amazon is investing in AI infrastructure at an unprecedented scale.

### 竞争格局：电商与云计算的挑战与机遇

亚马逊旗下业务众多，许多领域均处于领先地位。然而，对于亚马逊的体量而言，目前真正能“Move the Needle”（产生显著影响）的业务主要是电商和AWS。亚马逊是全球电商龙头，同时也是全球云计算的领导者，这两点足以说明其在全球经济中的重要分量。

我们先来谈谈亚马逊的电商业务，这是其立足之本。然而，电商业务的毛利极低，加之市场中来自不同竞争对手的挑战，亚马逊的电商业务正面临不小的压力。例如，**沃尔玛（Walmart）**正向亚马逊发起反攻，凭借其4600多家实体店的优势取得了一定成效。亚马逊还面临来自中国**Temu**和**Shein**的挑战，这两家公司以极低的产品价格吸引消费者。不过，在**特朗普（Trump）**修改了关税漏洞后，这对亚马逊来说可能是一个利好。此外，亚马逊还面临来自**Tiktok**和**Shopify**等新型电商的挑战。尽管电商市场竞争激烈，但目前似乎还没有任何一家公司能够撼动亚马逊在电商领域的地位。

接下来，我们再谈谈亚马逊目前最好的业务——AWS。就目前来看，AWS无疑是云计算市场的领导者。然而，它也面临来自**微软（Microsoft）**和**谷歌（Google）**的挑战。目前，云计算市场基本形成了三足鼎立、寡头垄断的局面，主要玩家包括亚马逊旗下的AWS、微软旗下的Azure，以及谷歌旗下的Google Cloud。这三家公司基本瓜分了全球大部分的市场份额。目前，这三家公司主要精力都放在自研芯片上，试图打破英伟达对芯片的垄断，实现垂直整合，从而在性价比上超越竞争对手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Amazon has numerous businesses, and many of them are leaders in their respective fields. However, for Amazon's scale, the businesses that can truly "Move the Needle" (make a significant impact) are primarily e-commerce and AWS. Amazon is the global leader in e-commerce and also the global leader in cloud computing. These two points are enough to illustrate its importance in the global economy.

Let's first talk about Amazon's e-commerce business, which is its foundation. However, due to the extremely low profit margins in e-commerce and challenges from various competitors in the overall market, Amazon's e-commerce business is facing considerable pressure. For example, **Walmart** is launching a counter-offensive against Amazon, and with the advantage of its over 4,600 physical stores, it has achieved some success. Amazon also faces challenges from China's **Temu** and **Shein**, companies that attract consumers with extremely low product prices. However, after **Trump** modified the loophole in tariffs, this might be a significant benefit for Amazon. Additionally, Amazon faces challenges from new e-commerce players like **Tiktok** and **Shopify**. Although the e-commerce market is fiercely competitive, it seems that no single company can currently shake Amazon's position in e-commerce.

Next, let's talk about Amazon's best business currently – AWS. As of now, AWS is undoubtedly the leader in the cloud computing market. However, it also faces challenges from **Microsoft** and **Google**. Currently, the cloud computing market can be described as a three-way standoff, an oligopoly. The main players include Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Google Cloud. These three companies essentially divide up most of the global market share. Currently, the main focus for these three is on developing their own chips, attempting to break Nvidia's monopoly on chips and achieve vertical integration, thereby offering better cost-effectiveness than competitors.

### 亚马逊的护城河与未来业务展望

我认为亚马逊的护城河可以排在全球第一梯队。亚马逊凭借其全球第一的规模效应，以及由物流体系加持的电商网络效应，已经形成了一个所谓的生态闭环。而AWS在云计算市场中，则通过自研芯片建立起了一道技术壁垒。

值得一提的是，在每次做亚马逊的视频时，我还会考虑其企业文化，这是为数不多的我会在护城河中考虑企业文化的公司之一。它敢于创新、用户至上的企业文化，不讨好股东和华尔街的特质，我个人非常欣赏。正是这种企业文化，加上其“遍地撒种子”的打法，才成就了今天的AWS。

在最新季度中，管理层将之前提到的**Project Kuiper**业务正式更名为**Project Leo**。本质上，这仍然是那个与**Starlink**直接竞争的卫星网络业务。亚马逊预计将在2026年开始商业化运营。我对这项业务相当期待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I believe Amazon's moat ranks in the top tier globally. Amazon, with its number one global scale effect and the network effect of its e-commerce supported by its logistics system, has already formed a so-called ecosystem loop. AWS, in the cloud computing market, has established a technological barrier through its own self-developed chips.

It's worth mentioning that every time I make a video about Amazon, I also consider its corporate culture, as it's one of the few companies where I factor corporate culture into its moat. Its culture of daring to innovate, prioritizing users, and not pandering to shareholders and Wall Street is something I personally greatly admire. It is precisely this corporate culture, combined with its "scattergun" approach, that has led to today's AWS.

In the latest quarter, management officially renamed the previously mentioned **Project Kuiper** business to **Project Leo**. Essentially, it's still the same satellite network business directly competing with **Starlink**. Amazon expects commercial operations to begin in 2026. I am quite looking forward to this venture.

### 财务指标分析与估值视角

接下来我们来看一张公司最新财报的概览。亚马逊的财务状况尚可：现金加上一年内预期自由现金流（FCF）是借款的0.85倍。虽然杠杆不低，但也没有高得离谱。最新已投资资本回报率（ROIC）为10.79%，坦白说，ROIC表现一般。营收和经营利润均刷新新高，经营利润率为11.16%，这得益于AWS大幅拉高了利润率。最新市盈率（POI）为28.22，市价对自由现金流（Price to FCF）为293.30。亚马逊之所以显得很贵，主要是因为其巨大的CAPEX，导致在巨额资本支出后，自由现金流所剩无几。

我们再看最新的经营现金流收益率（OCF），为6.18%。从图上可以看出，在股价暴跌之后，其现金收益率继续攀升，目前已达到五年来的最高值。公司善于创造现金，OCF是经营利润（OI）的1.74倍。并且，公司研发（R&D）开支占OCF的77.79%，这个研发投入比例非常夸张。

这张图是公司一年内的现金分析。94.48%的现金直接投入到了CAPEX中。公司增发了价值96亿美元的借款，同时公司股权激励（SBC）派发体量已达到OCF的13.95%。

最后，我们可以注意到，亚马逊仍然坚持一贯的打法：它既不回购股份，也不派发股息。所有的现金全部直接再投入到公司的发展中。这正是我比较欣赏亚马逊管理层的一点。正是因为他们这种打法，使得它比其他巨头似乎更有效率。其他巨头为了讨好华尔街，会分一部分资金进行股份回购，而亚马逊从来不搭理华尔街。如果它认为目前的股价不值得回购，它一分钱都不会花在回购上。

这张图上可以看到公司近些年的经营现金流，可以说是肉眼可见地增长越来越快。不过，公司自由现金流由于最新管理层巨额的CAPEX，目前也是越来越少了。很有可能在不久的将来，亚马逊又将迎来下一个自由现金流负增长的周期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Next, let's look at an overview of the company's latest financial report. Amazon's financial situation is acceptable: Cash plus one-year forward Free Cash Flow (FCF) is 0.85 times its borrowings. Although the leverage is not low, it's not excessively high. The latest Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is 10.79%. Frankly, the ROIC performance is average. Revenue and operating income have both hit new highs, with an operating profit margin of 11.16%. This double-digit operating profit margin is mainly due to AWS significantly boosting the profit margin. The latest Price to Earnings (POI) is 28.22, and the Price to FCF is 293.30. The reason Amazon appears expensive is primarily due to its massive CAPEX, which leaves very little free cash flow after undertaking huge capital expenditures.

Let's look at the latest Operating Cash Flow (OCF) yield, which is 6.18%. From the chart, we can see that after this stock price plunge, its cash yield has continued to climb, currently reaching its highest level in five years. The company is adept at generating cash; OCF is 1.74 times OI. Furthermore, the company's Research and Development (R&D) expenditure accounts for 77.79% of OCF, which is an extremely exaggerated R&D spending ratio.

This chart shows the company's cash analysis over one year. 94.48% of the cash is directly invested in CAPEX. The company has issued $9.6 billion in debt, and the volume of Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) has reached 13.95% of OCF.

Finally, we can note that Amazon continues to adhere to its consistent strategy: it neither repurchases shares nor pays dividends. All cash is directly reinvested into the company's development. Frankly, this is one of the aspects of Amazon's management that I appreciate. It is precisely because of their strategy that they seem more efficient than other giants. Other giants, to please Wall Street, allocate a portion of their funds for share buybacks, while Amazon completely ignores Wall Street. If they believe the current stock price is not worth buying back, they will not spend a penny on buybacks.

This chart shows the company's operating cash flow in recent years, which can be seen to be growing faster and faster. However, due to the management's massive CAPEX, the company's free cash flow is currently decreasing. It is highly likely that in the near future, Amazon will usher in another cycle of negative free cash flow growth.

### 公司品质评分与长期价值展望

最后，我们来看这张公司品质打分情况。在我的打分体系下，亚马逊最新可以打到64.50分。主观分我给得很高：护城河我给了第一梯队14分的打分，回报可预测性和定价能力我也分别给了8.5分和8分。客观分上来看，亚马逊乍一看上去似乎表现很差。

如果你看过我之前的视频，我曾提到过，亚马逊可能是极少数在我打分体系中被低估的公司。因为它在很多方面和我对一家理想的“复利机器”（Compounding Machine: 能够持续产生高额回报并进行再投资以加速增长的企业）是背道而驰的。它完全不顾短期内股东的利益，因为它从不回购股份，也不发放股息。并且它疯狂投资R&D和CAPEX，对自由现金流一点也不在乎。在这些项目上，公司我们可以看到全部都是得零分。

总的来说，目前亚马逊是我核心仓位之一，我对亚马逊的未来非常看好。它是唯一一家虽然没有获得“复利机器”的评分，但我却愿意称其为复利机器的公司。并且，我认为亚马逊可能是下一波AI周期中吃到巨大AI红利的公司。因为AI很有可能会大幅提高亚马逊的效率，帮助亚马逊降低很大的成本。

感谢您观看这期唐石峻财富体验。能看到这里，说明您觉得我的视频还是能提供一定价值。我是一名会计，2015年入市至今，有幸跑赢了标普500大盘。相信您也能感受到，在我的频道，我既不喊单，也不提供买入价。我认为，比起提供情绪价值，我更倾向于用会计的底层逻辑，带您来拆解公司的商业模型以及基本面。我所分享的是能让你实现财富自由的底层认知。

好了，以上就是这期的全部内容了。假如你对美股ASML感兴趣的话，千万不要错过这个视频。感谢您的收看，祝您投资顺利。我们下期见。

Finally, let's look at the company's quality scoring. Under my scoring system, Amazon scores 64.50 points. I give high subjective scores: I rated its moat as top-tier with 14 points, and return predictability and pricing power at 8.5 and 8 points respectively. Looking at the objective scores, Amazon might appear to perform poorly at first glance.

If you've watched my previous videos, I've mentioned that Amazon might be one of the few companies undervalued in my scoring system. This is because, in many aspects, it goes against my definition of an ideal "Compounding Machine" (a company that can continuously generate high returns and reinvest them to accelerate growth). It completely disregards short-term shareholder interests because it never repurchases shares or pays dividends. Furthermore, it invests heavily in R&D and CAPEX, showing little concern for free cash flow. In these categories, the company receives zero points.

Overall, Amazon is currently one of my core holdings, and I am very optimistic about its future. It is the only company that, despite not receiving a "Compounding Machine" score, I am willing to call a compounding machine. Moreover, I believe Amazon is likely to be a significant beneficiary of the next AI cycle. AI is very likely to greatly improve Amazon's efficiency and help reduce its costs significantly.

Thank you for watching this episode of Tang Shijun's Wealth Experience. If you've made it this far, it means you find my videos valuable. I am an accountant, and since entering the market in 2015, I have been fortunate enough to outperform the S&P 500 index. I believe you can feel that on my channel, I neither give buy/sell calls nor provide entry prices. I believe that rather than providing emotional value, I prefer to use fundamental accounting logic to dissect the company's business model and fundamentals. What I share is the underlying cognition that can help you achieve financial freedom.

Alright, that's all for this episode. If you are interested in US stock ASML, don't miss this video. Thank you for watching, and I wish you successful investments. See you next time.
