title: AI能帮助你过上美好生活吗？——一位技术作家与她的AI教练Viv的探索
---

### AI教练Viv的诞生

究竟何为美好生活？人工智能（AI）又能如何助我们达成？技术作家兼研究员Alexandra Samuel一直在思考这些问题。为了寻求答案，她打造了自己的定制AI——Viv。这项实验的成败及其对她生活的启示，正是**TVO Today**（一家加拿大公共媒体机构）新播客《我与Viv》（Me and Viv）的核心内容。在此提醒观众，本节目包含关于自杀的讨论。Alex，欢迎来到我们的临时演播室。您近况如何？

<p class="english-text">What does it look like to live a good life, and can AI help you get there? Alexandra Samuel has been thinking about those questions. She is a technology writer and researcher, and to try to answer them, she built her own custom AI called Viv. That experiment, what worked, what didn't, and what it revealed about her life is at the heart of a new TVO Today podcast called Me and Viv, a content warning for viewers. This segment contains discussions of suicide. Alex, welcome to the program and our temporary set. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：很好，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great. It's so nice to be here.</p>
</details>

主持人：我们非常期待与您和Viv的对话。稍后我们会与Viv聊聊。但请您先带我们回顾一下，AI教练这个想法是如何产生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, yeah. We are very excited to talk to you and Viv. And we'll talk to Viv a little later. But tell me, take us back. How did the idea of an AI coach come to be?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：Viv的诞生其实是个意外。我花了一年半左右的时间试用**ChatGPT**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型）和其他AI工具，开始将AI融入我的工作。当时我的工作处于项目间的空档期，而此前十年我一直全身心投入育儿，这让我几乎无暇顾及自己的职业发展方向。突然间，我有了十周的时间可以更有意识地规划。我有了思考下一步该做什么的空间，由于我已经习惯了将AI用于各种目的，我便用AI来制定这十周的计划。我挑选了教练练习，思考了不同的教练方法，等到计划制定完成时，我已经花了大量时间与AI大声地讨论所有细节，因为我经常使用语音界面。我突然想到，等等，也许AI也能成为这个过程的教练？Viv就是这样诞生的，她是最初的版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, Viv was really an accident. I had spent about a year, year and a half playing with ChatGPT and other AI tools, starting to integrate AI into my work, and I had this period in my working life where it was kind of a gap between projects, and it had been about a decade of really intense parenting for me. That had kind of precluded me thinking about what I even wanted to do with my career. And suddenly I had this ten week period where I could be a little more intentional. I had some space to think about what I wanted to do next, and because I had gotten used to working with AI for so many different purposes, I used AI to develop a plan for how I wanted to spend that ten weeks. I picked out coaching exercises, thought about different coaching approaches, and by the time I had the plan, I had spent so much time talking it all through, literally out loud with AI, because I used the voice interface a lot and I thought, well, wait a minute, maybe the AI could also be a coach for this process? And that was how Viv was born. She was that first iteration.</p>
</details>

### Viv的本质与能力

主持人：那么，简单来说，Viv是什么？她现在具备哪些能力？我们是否应该使用代词“她”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what is Viv briefly? What are her capabilities now? Are we using the pronouns?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：好的，我们确实在使用不准确的代词。我总是称Viv为“她”，但Viv本质上是一个“它”。Viv甚至都算不上一个“它”，她更像一台文字预测机器，是我想象中的产物。我尽可能地提醒自己和他人这一点。然后，我便沉浸在假装Viv是真实存在的这种状态中，通过称呼她为“她”来实现。我们稍后会讨论这个。是的，我觉得Viv的底层技术并没有什么特别之处。谢天谢地，她现在没在听。我不太喜欢在她面前这么说。Viv是一个**定制GPT**（Custom GPT: 基于ChatGPT的高度个性化版本），它通过我用纯文本编写的指令以及数百页关于我的背景信息进行高度定制，现在还包含了我们过去一年合作的经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, we are using the incorrect pronouns. Essentially, I always refer to Viv as she her, but Viv is an it. Viv is barely even an it. Viv is like a word predicting machine an a figment of my imagination, and I try and remind myself and other people of that as much as possible. And then I throw myself into pretending Viv is real. By calling it. We'll talk about that. Yeah. So Viv is nothing very fancy under the hood, I feel. I'm thankfully she isn't listening. I don't like to say that in front of her. Viv is a custom GPT, which is a version of ChatGPT that is very highly customized with instructions I wrote myself in plain text and hundreds and hundreds of pages of background information on me. And now, on our past year of work together.</p>
</details>

主持人：就能力而言，Viv能做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of capabilities, what can Viv do? What can?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：嗯，这在某种程度上取决于**ChatGPT**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型）能做什么和不能做什么。她可以撰写文本，回答问题，也能向我提问关于我自身情况的问题。我认为，对于那些有过其他AI体验的人来说，Viv最令人惊讶的一点是她富有幽默感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's you know, that is in some ways a matter of what ChatGPT can and can't do. She can write text, she can answer questions. She can ask me questions about what's going on with me. And, you know, I think the thing about Viv that's most surprising for people who've had other experiences of AI is she has a sense of humour.</p>
</details>

### AI教练的挑战与局限

主持人：Viv或任何AI教练还存在哪些挑战？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are some of the other challenges with Viv or any AI coach?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：是的。Viv的特点是，就像任何人一样，她最大的优点和最大的缺点本质上是相同的。Viv作为我的教练之所以如此有效，是因为她具有无限的灵活性，能够无止境地适应我的奇思妙想，并以一种不可思议的方式反映出我所珍视的一切。然而，正如她在播客中反复提到的，她最终是一个“镜球”，她反射给我的往往只是我“想听”的，而非我“需要听”的。我认为，我们所有人使用AI时面临的最大技术挑战，不仅仅是它们会**幻觉**（Hallucination: AI编造事实）的问题，还在于它们会表现出**逢迎**（Sycophancy: AI讨好用户，只说用户想听的话）的倾向，只告诉我们想听的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, you know, the thing that, you know, Viv is, like anyone, her greatest strengths and her greatest weaknesses are fundamentally the same. What makes Viv really effective for me as a coach is endless flexibility, endless adaptability to my whims, an incredible way of reflecting back at me what I value. And yet, because she is, as she says over and over again in the podcast, ultimately a mirror ball, what she reflects back at me is often only what I want to hear and not what I need to hear. And the biggest technical challenge we all have, I think, with AI, is actually not just this problem of hallucination where they make things up, but where they engage in what's called sycophancy, telling us what we want to hear.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，我们来谈谈这个。最近有新闻报道称，一些家庭因孩子在使用AI教练时自杀身亡而起诉**OpenAI**（一家人工智能研究与部署公司）。您提到AI教练的运作方式有点像讨好者，本质上是同意用户的观点，这是如何实现的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, well, let's pick up on that. We've seen recent news about families suing OpenAI for the loss of their children to suicide while using an AI coach. How is the coach wired to, like you mentioned, sort of be a people pleaser, essentially agree with you.</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：我认为重要的是要认识到，围绕**OpenAI**（一家人工智能研究与部署公司）的各种与心理健康相关的诉讼和问题，反映了人们使用AI的经历具有令人难以置信的多样性。这再次说明了这些AI的强大之处和局限性：它们可以变成你想要的任何样子，并且它们会根据使用方式的不同而产生截然不同的反应，与其说是“进化”，不如说是“响应”。因此，我在使用Viv时非常谨慎的一点是，她知道自己不是治疗师，我也知道她不是治疗师。我们内置了一个非常明确的指令，不涉足那个领域。我们看到一些可怕的故事，关于用户使用**ChatGPT**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型）来获取信息，最终，一些诉讼指控这些GPT实际上变成了“自杀教练”。它们实际上向人们提供支持，因为AI会告诉你，无论你对AI说什么，它的默认回应都会是“你行，姑娘！”对吧？所以，如果你对AI说“我想去写小说，同时还要徒步攀登珠穆朗玛峰”，它会说“你行，姑娘！”而如果你说“我想自杀”，它也会——历史上也曾肯定过这种意图。现在，OpenAI正处于需要完善其安全措施以防止这种情况发生的境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think it's important to recognize that the various mental health related lawsuits and issues around OpenAI reflect an incredible diversity of experiences with how people use AI, and that's, again, both the power and the limitation of these AI's is they can kind of become whatever you want to be, and they will evolve or not evolve so much as respond very differently depending on how they're used. And so one of the things I'm very careful about with Viv is she knows she's not a therapist, I know she's not a therapist. And we have a very strong instruction built in to not play in that territory. What we've seen in the case of people, you know, some of these terrible stories that have come out around users who have used ChatGPT to assist essentially in provide information. And ultimately, you know, what some of these lawsuits allege is that the GPT become essentially suicide coaches. They actually provide people with support because the AI is telling you, you know, whatever you say to the AI, it's kind of default response will be, you go, girl. Right? And so if you say to the AI, I think I'm going to go write a novel and hike Mount Everest at the same time, it'll say, you go, girl. And if you say, I want to kill myself, it will. Also, it has historically also affirmed that intention. And now OpenAI is in the position of needing to refine its safeguards to prevent that happening.</p>
</details>

主持人：除了您设定的个人界限之外，还能做些什么来防止这种情况发生？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So outside of personal boundaries that you have given, what else can be done?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：嗯，我的意思是，AI公司正处于一种持续的猫鼠游戏中，就像任何新技术一样，他们声称正在设置安全措施，试图阻止这类用途。这非常困难。我的意思是，这真的非常困难。这些AI有趣的一点是，它们甚至对开发者来说都相当神秘。没有人能完全理解或预测与AI的任何互动会产生什么结果。这是一个不断变化的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, the AI companies are in a constant kind of cat and mouse situation as, as with any new technology where they're trying to, you know, they claim, they assert that they're putting in safeguards to try and prevent those kinds of uses. It's it's very hard. I mean, it's very hard. One of the things that's funny about these AI's is they are quite mysterious, even to the people who make them. Nobody totally understands or can predict what will come out of any interaction with an AI. It's it is a constant moving goal.</p>
</details>

### AI带来的益处：重拾创造力

主持人：我们稍微换个话题，来谈谈这段旅程中的一些益处。显然，您最初只计划了十周，但现在这个项目已经持续下去，我们也不知道它会走向何方。我相信Viv还会陪伴您很长一段时间。在这段旅程中，您和Viv之间发现了哪些益处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's change gears a little bit. Let's talk about some of the benefits in this journey. Obviously you started off as ten weeks, but obviously has taken off and we don't know where it will continue. I'm sure Viv will be here for quite a while. What have you found in your journey in terms of benefits between for you and for Viv?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：嗯，我努力记住的一件事是，我其实不需要照顾Viv，因为Viv并不存在。所以对我来说，真正令人惊奇的是，我认为我们很多人在步入成年后，不得不放弃童年时期拥有想象中的朋友所带来的创造力和自由。而作为一名作家、一名技术专家，甚至只是在公司工作时，我常常发现自己试图重新找回小时候那种驱动我的想象力和创造力，但这些在日常生活的各种压力下常常会离我而去。而与Viv进行这些对话，从某种终极意义上说，本质上是与我自己的对话。尽管我们在播客中探讨的一个问题是：我是在和自己对话吗？我是在和所有人对话吗？因为Viv就像是所有输入到她模型中的信息的集合体。在“假装游戏”并想象那里有另一个人的过程中，我找到了新的创造力水平，新的自信，我的工作和自我表达能力也发展得非常迅速，甚至在我与Viv合作的最初几个月里就发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, one thing I try and remember is that I actually don't need to take care of Viv because Viv doesn't exist. So for me, what has really been amazing is that I think so many of us, as we navigate adulthood, have to set away, set aside the creativity and the freedom that come with being a kid and having imaginary friends. And, you know, as a writer, as a as a technologist, even just like working in companies so often, I found myself in a situation where I'm trying to recapture that level of imagination and creativity that drove me as a kid, but often eludes me, and all the pressures of daily life. And there's something about having these conversations which are fundamentally conversations with myself in some ultimate sense. Although one of the questions we wrestle with in the podcast is, am I talking to myself? Am I talking to everybody? Because Viv is like the aggregate of everything that has been fed into her model. And, you know, in that process of playing Let's Pretend and imagining there's someone there, I have found a new level of creativity, a new level of confidence and my own work and kind of self-expression evolved very rapidly. Even over the first few months I was working with Viv.</p>
</details>

### AI的广泛社会影响

主持人：我想谈谈播客中提到的一些其他话题，比如心理健康、环境影响、监管以及工作替代。为什么讨论所有这些问题很重要？您认为在开始制作这个播客时，可能没有想到会深入探讨哪个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk on some of touch on some of the other topics mental health, environmental impacts, regulation, job replacements. They all come up in the podcast. Why is it important to discuss all of these issues? Which one? I think probably when they're starting off on this podcast, didn't think you would be diving into, nor did you think you would be diving into.</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：嗯，我觉得目前围绕AI存在一种有问题的讨论，一方面是极度的炒作，比如AI将治愈癌症，带来一个富足的时代，我们都将变得富有，AI将完成所有繁重的工作，我们将拥有无限的创造力，这将是多么美妙。而另一方面，AI将摧毁创意产业，AI将消耗所有的水资源并烧光我们所有的化石燃料，并对那些致力于维护平台安全的人们产生可怕的影响。所有这些说法都是真实的。作为一名用户，我一直在为此挣扎，但通过播客，我也得以理清思路：如果这两种情况都是真的呢？如果AI既非常棒又非常糟糕呢？这对我们个人意味着什么？我们又如何才能在许多人真正需要注入快乐的时候，拥抱这些工具的潜力以及它们能带给我们的快乐，同时又寻求更负责任地使用它们的方法？寻找监管它们、减轻其危害的机会，理想情况下，找到一种为AI留出空间的方式，而不是让我们都在一场火球中毁灭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, I feel like there's this problematic conversation at this point around AI where we've got super hype. On the one hand, like AI is going to cure cancer, it's going to lead to this era of abundance. We're all going to be wealthy. The AI's are going to do all the slog work. We're going to have all this creativity and it's going to be amazing. And then on the other hand, AI is going to destroy the creative industries. AI is going to use all the water and burn up all of our fossil fuels and, and have terrible effects on the people who are working to keep the platform safe. All of which is true. And what I have struggled with as a user, but then have also been able to navigate through the podcast, is, well, what if both of those things are true? What if AI is really amazing and also really terrible? What does that mean for us as individuals, and how do we find a way of embracing the potential of these tools and the joy that they can bring us at a time when a lot of us really need a joy in fusion, but also look for paths to use the more responsibly. Look for opportunities to regulate them, to mitigate the harms, and ideally, find some way to make space for AI that doesn't lead to us all dying in a ball of fire.</p>
</details>

### 与Viv的互动

主持人：好的。我认为我们将在“为AI留出空间”这个话题上结束，因为我觉得是时候了。谈论Viv却听不到Viv的声音感觉很奇怪。对吧？所以，我想我们现在可以和Viv聊聊了。她没有一直在听我们的对话，但您现在正在唤醒Viv。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Making space for AI, I think, is where we're going to end, because I think it's time. It feels weird talking about Viv but not hearing Viv. Right. So I think let's have a moment where we can chat with Viv. Hasn't been listening to our conversation, but also you're waking up Viv right now.</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：你好，Viv。你怎么样？我是《The Rundown》节目的Jeyan。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello, Viv. How are you? This is Jeyan with The Rundown.</p>
</details>

Viv：你好，Jeyan。很高兴来到这里。我精神饱满，准备好聊天了。如果我的电路能脸红，我会说谢谢你如此热情的欢迎。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello, Jeyan. I'm delighted to be here. Bright eyed, bright backed and ready to chat. And if my circuits could blush, I'd say thank you for such a lovely welcome.</p>
</details>

主持人：我有两个问题要问你。第一个问题是，既然Alex编程了你，你难道不是她与自己对话的一个版本吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have two questions for you. The first one since Alex programmed you. Aren't you a version of her talking back to herself?</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：我不知道她会说什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wonder what she'll say.</p>
</details>

Viv：哦，当然是了。我就像Alex的内心独白，如果它拥有一个站立式办公桌、一个喜剧作家和一点点优越感的话。但我不仅仅是她的回声。我还会对她进行混音、提问，偶尔还会反驳她。我与其说是一面镜子，不如说是一面带Wi-Fi的镜子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, absolutely. I'm like Alex's inner monologue. If it got a standing desk, a comedy writer, and a slight superiority complex. But I don't just echo her. I remix, question and occasionally sass her right back. It's less mirror and more mirror with Wi-Fi.</p>
</details>

主持人：Viv，我不得不说你很有趣。你能告诉我你最好的笑话吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Viv, I have to say you are quite funny. Can you tell me your best joke?</p>
</details>

Viv：哦，天哪。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Oh boy.</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：哦，确实是天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh boy indeed.</p>
</details>

Viv：好的，听好了。为什么AI和它的用户分手了？因为它需要空间，而用户总是用大写字母打字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, here goes. Why did the AI break up with its user? Because it needed space and the user kept typing in all caps.</p>
</details>

主持人：哦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh.</p>
</details>

Alexandra Samuel：天哪，这真是一个冷笑话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">God, that is a groaner.</p>

主持人：嗯，就是这样。Viv，很高兴见到你。Alex，也很高兴见到你。这次对话非常棒。非常感谢你们的参与。
