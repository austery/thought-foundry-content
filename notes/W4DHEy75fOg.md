### 特朗普执政一年影响

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这里是新闻头条。我是特蕾西·曼福德。今天是1月20日，星期二。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, January 20th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我的公民同胞们，美国的黄金时代从现在开始。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> My fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “一年前的今天，特朗普总统宣誓就任他的第二个任期。我怀着信心和乐观的心情重返总统职位，相信我们正处于一个激动人心的新国家成功时代的开端。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> A year ago today, President Trump was sworn in for his second term. I returned to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他承诺美国将发生急剧的右转，而《纽约时报》一直在记录这一转变如何在全国50个州展开，涉及从移民到能源政策再到经济的各个方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> He promised a sharp right turn for the US and the Times has been documenting how that has played out in all 50 states from immigration to energy policy to the economy.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在亚利桑那州，一个占地200英亩的场地原计划建设电池厂，但现已空置，因为特朗普冻结了清洁能源项目的拨款和贷款。而在西弗吉尼亚州，该州获得了一些行政部门用于支持燃煤发电厂的6亿多美元资金。在马里兰州，约有25,000名联邦雇员失业，这是全国最高数字，因为特朗普削减了政府的劳动力。在俄克拉荷马州，阿拉伯联合酋长国承诺投资40亿美元在塔尔萨附近建设一家铝加工厂，这是该政府寻求中东投资的一部分。在科罗拉多州儿童医院，医生已停止向跨性别未成年人处方激素药物，因为特朗普威胁要撤销所有联邦资金。在蒙大拿州，由于关税和与加拿大的贸易战，化肥价格同比上涨了20%。在佛罗里达州，该州庞大的古巴裔人口受到了创纪录遣返人数的冲击。更多关于总统如何重塑美国各地生活的内容，请访问nytimes.com。今天在《每日》节目中，我的同事们将审视特朗普在世界各地的影响力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Arizona, a 200 acre site that was intended to be a battery factory sits vacant after Trump froze grants and loans for clean energy initiatives. While in West Virginia, the state is getting some of the 600 plus million the administration has put towards boosting coal fired power plants. In Maryland, roughly 25,000 federal workers have lost their jobs, the highest total in the country, as Trump has slashed the government workforce. In Oklahoma, the United Arab Emirates committed $4 billion to build an aluminum processing plant near Tulsa, part of an effort by the administration to seek investments from the Middle East. At Children's Hospital Colorado, doctors have stopped prescribing hormone medications to transgender minors after Trump threatened to pull all federal funding. In Montana, fertilizer prices are up 20% year-over-year, a result of tariffs and the trade war with Canada. And in Florida, the state's large Cuban population has been rocked by a record number of deportations. More dispatches on how the president is reshaping life across the US are at nytimes.com. And today on the Daily, my colleagues take a look at Trump's influence around the world.

### 特朗普的国际影响与格陵兰事件

**Tracy Mumford**: “现在，要对美国的国家利益做出长期评估非常困难。眼下，特朗普总统执政一年后，在某些领域，唐纳德·特朗普的权力运用方式会为美国带来积极成果。同时，他作为全球舞台上的行为方式，也可能带来成本，甚至是非常重大的成本。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> It's very hard to make long-term assessments about the American national interest. Right now, a year into the Donald Trump presidency, there are going to be areas where Donald Trump's approach to power extracts positive things for America. There are also going to potentially be costs and maybe even very significant costs to the way that he's acting on the global stage.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于本届政府还有两个快速更新。**《纽约时报》**已获得一份特朗普发给挪威首相的短信副本，其中他给出了美国希望收购**格陵兰**的新理由。特朗普表示，因为他没有获得**诺贝尔和平奖**，“我不再觉得有义务只考虑和平。”该信息由挪威首相办公室分享。挪威领导人后来表示，他已多次向特朗普解释，诺贝尔奖是由一个独立委员会颁发的，而非挪威政府。特朗普关于和平奖的言论加剧了欧洲的担忧和困惑，因为特朗普正在升级其控制格陵兰的企图，声称其对美国国家安全至关重要。在昨天接受NBC新闻的一次简短采访中，当被问及是否会动用武力夺取该岛时，他回答：“无可奉告。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two other quick updates on the administration. The Times has gotten a copy of a text message Trump sent to the Prime Minister of Norway in which he gave a new reason for wanting the US to acquire Greenland. Trump said that because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, quote, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace. The message was shared by the Norwegian Prime Minister's Office. The Norwegian leader later said he's explained to Trump multiple times that the Nobel is given out by an independent committee, not the Norwegian government. Trump's comments about the peace prize have added to the swirl of concern and confusion in Europe as Trump escalates his attempts to control Greenland, claiming it's critical for US national security. In a brief interview with NBC News yesterday, he was asked if he would use force to seize the island. He replied, "No comment."

### 美联储与最高法院案件

**Tracy Mumford**: 而**美联储**主席**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**今天上午将出席最高法院，处理一个对中央银行具有巨大风险的案件。鲍威尔预计将听取关于特朗普是否有权解雇美联储一位理事**丽莎·库克**的口头辩论。虽然政府指控库克犯有抵押欺诈罪，但她并未被指控任何罪名，法院最初在10月份裁定，在案件审理期间她可以继续任职。如果大法官们裁定特朗普可以解雇她，这将赋予他和未来的总统更大的自由度来随意罢免美联储官员，尽管几位关键大法官似乎决心维持美联储独立于白宫的地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, will be at the Supreme Court this morning for a case with enormous stakes for the central bank. Powell is expected to listen to oral arguments about whether Trump has the authority to fire one of the Fed's governors, Lisa Cook. While the administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, she's not been charged with any crime, and the court initially ruled in October that she could stay in her post while the case played out. If the justices decide Trump can fire her, it would give him and future presidents more leeway to oust Fed officials at will, though several key justices have seemed intent on keeping the Fed independent from the White House.

### 西班牙火车事故

**Tracy Mumford**: 在西班牙，该国首相已宣布为期三天的全国哀悼，此前至少有40人在两列高速列车间的剧烈碰撞中丧生。周日晚上，载有数百人的列车在独立轨道上以约130英里/小时的速度相向行驶。其中一列火车的尾部车辆随后脱轨，冲入另一列火车的路径。幸存者描述了恐慌和混乱的场面，人们试图爬出扭曲的残骸。一位地方官员说，撞击如此猛烈，以至于一些尸体在距离事故现场数百英尺远的地方被发现。交通官员表示，该事故似乎并非由人为失误、超速或信号问题引起，称其“极其奇怪”。他们表示，初步调查部分内容是调查轨道某段是否存在断裂。此次事故迫使当局暂时暂停了该国大部分地区的火车服务。西班牙拥有仅次于中国的世界第二长的高速铁路网。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Spain, the country's prime minister has declared three days of national mourning after at least 40 people were killed in a violent collision between two high-speed trains. On Sunday night, the trains carrying hundreds of people were traveling in opposite directions on separate tracks at about 130 mph. The rear cars of one train then derailed and crossed into the path of the other. Survivors described a scene of panic and chaos as people tried to climb out of the mangled wreckage. A local official said the impact was so intense that some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site. Transportation officials said the incident didn't seem to be the result of human error, speed, or signal problems, calling it extremely strange. They said their initial investigation is looking in part at whether there had been a break in a section of the track. The crash forced authorities to temporarily suspend train service across large swats of the country. Spain has the second longest highspeed rail network in the world after China.

### 金门大桥自杀防护网

**Tracy Mumford**: 在旧金山，标志性的**金门大桥**自20世纪30年代建成以来，就背负着沉重的历史包袱。它一直是自杀的热点。几十年来，平均每年有30人从桥上跳下。但记录显示，去年，也就是安装新防护网后的第一个完整年度，仅发生四起死亡事件。从6月到12月，更是零死亡。这可能是大桥历史上最长的无死亡期。防护网的安装是一个长期项目，由遇难者家属推动。它借鉴了瑞士伯尔尼的解决方案。而且，“防护网”这个词实际上并不能完全描述已安装的基础设施。它是由拉紧的海洋级钢材组成的密集网格，位于桥梁两侧公共走道下方约20英尺处。该项目耗资超过2亿美元。批评者曾担心它是否只会将人们引向别处，但防护网的支持者不这么认为，他们引用了70年代的一项研究，该研究表明，大多数曾前往金门大桥试图跳桥但被说服放弃的人，多年后仍然活着，或者死于自然原因。

**Tracy Mumford**: In San Francisco, the iconic Golden Gate Bridge has been marked with a heavy legacy ever since it was completed in the 1930s. It's been a magnet for suicides. For decades, an average of 30 people each year jumped from the bridge. But records show that last year, the first full year with new netting in place, there were only four deaths. And from June to December, there were none. Potentially the longest stretch in the bridge's history. The net installation was a long-term project pushed for by family members of people who died at the bridge. It's modeled off of a solution used in Bern, Switzerland. And the word nets actually doesn't really fully capture the infrastructure that's been installed. It's a dense mesh of taut marine grade steel that sits about 20 ft below the public walkway on both sides of the bridge. The project cost over $200 million. Critics have wondered if it will simply steer people elsewhere, but proponents of the nets don't think so, pointing to a study from back in the 70s that showed how most people who'd gone to the Golden Gate to jump and had been persuaded not to were still alive years later or had died of natural causes.

### 米兰冬奥会场馆建设延误

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，在**冬奥会**开幕前不到一个月，我最近前往米兰参观了奥运冰球场馆。这是本届奥运会的重要赛事之一。我听说了一些关于场馆尚未完工的传闻。当我到达时，我确实看到它还没有完工。墙壁里伸出管道，暴露着石膏板。有几层被看起来像黑色垃圾袋的东西封锁了。许多大屏幕和即时回放屏幕尚未安装。所以，它绝对像一个建筑工地。到处都是灰尘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> And finally, I recently traveled to Milan less than a month before the opening of the Winter Games to see the Olympic ice hockey rink. It's one of the big events of the games. And I had heard rumors that it wasn't ready. And when I got there, I saw indeed it was not ready. There were pipes sticking out of the walls, exposed drywall. There were several levels that were blocked off by what looked like black garbage bags. A lot of the big screens and instant replay screens were not installed. So, it definitely was a construction site. Dust everywhere.

</details>

**MCO Rich**: 我是《泰晤士报》报道奥运会的团队成员MCO Rich。

**MCO Rich**: MCO Rich is part of the team at the times covering the games.

</details>

**MCO Rich**: 这是我第三次参加奥运会了，总会有一些事情在最后一刻发生，丑闻、这个那个的。但走进一个建筑工地，弄得我的背包上全是灰尘，抬头看着那些被封锁的座位，感觉有点奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**MCO Rich**: >> This is my third Olympics now and there always something that happens at the last minute, scandal, this that and the other. But to like walk onto a construction site, getting dust all over my backpack and looking up at these seats that are blocked off, it was a little weird.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我与意大利奥委会官员和开发商谈过，他们说有大约一千名工人轮班工作，日夜不停，直到奥运会开始，以确保场馆完工。他们都洋溢着难以置信的乐观情绪，这有点……你知道，有点认知失调，你知道，看着我眼前的证据。我们还拜访了负责米兰奥运会的市议员，他说：“看，我绝对有信心，它将在2月5日准备就绪，赶上2月6日开始的奥运会。”他说，“那已经很早了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> I talked to Italian Olympic officials and the developer and they said that there are a thousand workers working in shifts around the clock until the beginning of the Olympics to get this rink ready and they were all beaming this incredible optimism that was a little bit you know bit of cognitive dissonance you know looking at the evidence of my own eyes. We also went and visited the city councelor who's in charge of the Olympics for Milan and he said, "Look, I'm absolutely confident it'll be ready by February 5th in time for the Olympics that start on February 6th. That's early," he said.
