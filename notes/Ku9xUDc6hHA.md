### 零售交易的演变与Robinhood的崛起

欢迎收听新一期的**OddLots podcast**（OddLots播客：彭博社旗下探讨金融市场和经济的播客节目）。我是乔·魏森塔尔（Joe Weisenthal）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

我是特蕾西·阿洛威（Tracy Aloway）。特蕾西，有件事让我很惊讶。现在是2025年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, here's something that surprised me. Okay. So, it's 2025.</p>
</details>

我本以为，你知道，你对现在是2025年感到惊讶吗？我惊讶我们能坚持这么久。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would have thought, you know, are you surprised it's 2025? I'm surprised we made it this long. I'm surprised.</p>
</details>

我感到惊讶，你知道，回想起2021年那个时代的加密货币热潮、**SPAC**（Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司，通过IPO募集资金以收购一家现有公司）狂热以及所有那些疯狂的事情。我曾认为，在某种程度上，那会更像昙花一现，因为你知道，就像1999年到2000年，几年后人们就不再谈论.com股票了。我以为那会重演，所有这些散户对期权、看涨期权和投机等的痴迷，我以为那会是一个短暂的现象。许多人在2022年和2023年，当其中一些东西破裂时，会亏钱，然后他们会失去兴趣，转而去做其他事情，暂时忘记交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm surprised, you know, and I think back to 2021 and like the crypto boom of that era and the stock the spack mania and all that stuff, that craziness. Like I sort of thought to some extent that would have been a little bit more flash in the pan because you know like 99 2000 a couple years later like people were not talking about.com stocks like two years later and because I'm like I I thought it was going to be a repeat of that all of this retail obsession with options and call options and speculation etc. I thought that would be a thing, you know, short phenomenon. A bunch of people lose their money in 2022 and 2023 when some of that stuff busts and then they lose interest and they go on to other things and sort of forget about trading for a while.</p>
</details>

但我认为我这个假设是错误的。我认为人们发现他们真的很喜欢亏钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I don't think that was an incorrect assumption on my part. I think people discovered that they really enjoy losing money. It is um</p>
</details>

是的，他们当然……好吧。我真正想说的是，这一切都始于疫情期间，对吧？在某种程度上，是的。但我认为加密货币打开了这样一种观念：你可以在屏幕上看到一个数字，然后押注它会涨还是跌，基本上就像一个合成数字，对吧？它只是一个**代币**（Token: 一种数字资产，代表了区块链上的某种价值或权利）。然后疫情期间发生的事情是，所有人都非常无聊。**GameStop**（游戏驿站：一家美国电子游戏零售商，2021年因散户抱团推高股价而闻名）成了一个现象。每个人都发现**动量投资**（Momentum Investing: 追逐市场趋势，买入上涨的股票，卖出下跌的股票）可能比**价值投资**（Value Investing: 寻找被低估的股票进行投资）更有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, they certainly Okay. Genuinely, what I would say is this all started in the pandemic, right? To some Yeah, to some extent. But I think crypto opened the door to this idea that you can have a number on a screen and just bet whether it's going to go up or down like basically a synthetic number almost, right? It's just this token. And then what happened during the pandemic is everyone was really bored. GameStop became a thing. Uh everyone kind of discovered that Momentum was uh maybe more fun to play uh than boring stuff like Value. And I was, you know, it did honestly feel like a cultural shift when it came to the way people were thinking about trading. And I'm not I guess I'm not as surprised that it's it's continued to this day.</p>
</details>

老实说，这确实感觉像是一种文化转变，改变了人们对交易的看法。我对此持续至今并不感到那么惊讶。如果说有什么变化的话，那就是股票市场的这种代币化、人们玩期权、玩加密货币变得比以往任何时候都更盛行。这是一种文化转变。现在一切都有了价格，我认为这非常重要。就像今天，我们不断地关注政治的价格。我们不断地在**Kelshi**或**Poly Market**等网站上关注与地缘政治事件相关的价格。它已经扩展得如此之广，有加密货币，有期权交易等等。我们沉浸在一种文化中，即任何事情都有一个价格，任何正在发生的事情都可以交易。现在我认为，它将永远伴随我们，因为它显然不仅仅是像，你知道，一年左右的零利率时代，每个人都在家无聊的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if anything, this sort of tokenization of the stock market, people playing options, people playing crypto has become bigger than ever. It is this cultural shift. It's also like everything has a price now, which I think is very important. Like today, like we're constantly looking at prices for politics right now. We're constantly looking for prices related to geopolitical events on sites like Kelshi or Poly Market etc. It has expanded so much so there's crypto, there's options trading there, etc. Like we are like drenched in a culture of like there's a price on something, there's a thing that's going on, you can trade it. And I now think, you know, it's going to be with us forever because it clearly was not just like a uh, you know, a one-year sort of zer era everyone bored at home phenomenon.</p>
</details>

嗯，不仅仅是你能够交易它。现在你可以非常容易地交易它，对吧？你只需打开手机。有些东西你可以24小时交易，随心所欲地赚钱或亏钱。我喜欢，我喜欢随心所欲地赚钱或亏钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's not just that you could trade it. You can trade it really easily now, right? You can just open up your phone. Um, some things you can trade 24 hours a day and just make or lose money as you choose. I love uh I love making or losing money as I choose.</p>
</details>

总之，我们真正与那个时代散户参与热潮相关的公司之一，当然就是**Robinhood**（罗宾汉：一家美国金融科技公司，以提供免佣金股票和加密货币交易而闻名），这家公司因率先推出免费股票交易而闻名，这简直令人震惊，许多人都在使用它。对我来说，对许多人来说，它是他们接触期权和股票交易的入门，尤其是在疫情期间，与**Meme股**（Meme Stock: 因社交媒体炒作而股价飙升的股票）时代相关联，而这个时代某种程度上仍然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, one of the companies that we really associate with the sort of boom in retail participation that era and that of course is uh Robin Hood, the company that uh was uh famous for being the first to introduce free stock trading which is kind of mind-blowing and lots of people use it. For me, many people was their introduction to trading options and stocks particularly during the pandemic associated with the meme stock era which kind of still exists.</p>
</details>

总之，我们请到了最合适的嘉宾。请继续。我们本来要说什么？我想说的是，在我看来，Robinhood无疑在恰到好处的时机抓住了这场文化转变的浪潮。但在我看来，它也体现了用户界面的重要性。就像，这款应用确实更有趣，更好玩。我想有些人会说它比其他许多东西都更容易使用。这听起来像广告。我不是这个意思，但我记得，例如，当你过去在Robinhood上进行交易时，每次完成交易都会有一个小小的五彩纸屑动画。你能想象**TD Ameritrade**（德美利证券：一家美国在线券商）或**Schwab**（嘉信理财：一家美国金融服务公司）做这样的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, we have the perfect guest. Go on. What were we going to say? I was going to say Robin Hood in my mind like definitely caught the wave of this cultural shift at exactly the right time. But it's also in my mind like an ode to the importance of user interface. Like genuinely the app is just more interesting, more fun. I guess some people would say more easy to use than a lot of other things. This sounds like an ad. I don't mean it to be, but I remember for instance when uh you know when you used to make trades on Robin Hood and you would get like a little confetti animation every time you did it. Like can you imagine TDM trade or like Schwab or something doing something like that?</p>
</details>

我要说的另一件事是，他们做得非常好。股价基本上回到了历史最高点。它不仅仅是一家提供免费交易的公司。我认为他们有大约九个不同的业务单元，年收入运行率达到1亿美元。真的，我认为它正在成为一个巨头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the one other thing I'll say about them is they're doing phenomenally well. The stock is like back at like basically at all-time highs. It's not just a company that offers free trades. I think they have like nine different units at a hund00 million annual run rate raid. Truly, I think it's becoming a juggernaut.</p>
</details>

总之，很高兴地说，我们今天邀请到了他们的首席执行官兼创始人弗拉德·特内夫（Vlad Tenev）来到播客。弗拉德，非常感谢你来到OddLots。很高兴终于能和你聊天。谢谢你们热情的欢迎。很高兴来到这里。

<p class="english-text">Anyway, thrilled to say we have it CEO and founder Vlad Tennv on the podcast today. So, in studio, Vlad, thank you so much for coming on OddLog. Thrilled to finally be chatting with you. Thank you for the warm welcome. It's great to be here.</p>

### Robinhood的客户群体与业务战略

那么，在2020年和2021年进入市场的那些人，你知道，无论那个群体是什么，他们今天的行为与2019年或2018年的群体有什么不同吗？如果看看4月份波动期间的交易情况，他们有什么不同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that cohort that came into markets in like 2020 and 2021 that sort of you know the whatever that cohort was do they behave differently today than say the 2019 cohort or the 2018 cohort is there something about them that if you look at say trading in April during the volatility is there are they are they different</p>
</details>

是的，所以，我现在应该回溯四五年了。是的。很久以前了。在2019年和2020年，有很多人第一次进入市场。我认为在疫情爆发前，我在纽约。我记得那次访问，因为那是在一切变得奇怪之前。我们宣布平台上批准的账户达到了1000万个，这对我们来说是一个惊人的数字。但Robinhood在疫情开始之前就已经相当大了。所以我们有1000万个批准账户。很明显，我们已经开创了散户投资的新时代，因为在疫情之前，我们是一家D轮融资公司。所以，作为一家后期私人公司，我认为估值大约是70亿美元。我们有几亿美元的年收入运行率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I I should rewinding four five years at this point. Yeah. Long time ago now. There were lots of people that came into the market for the first time in 2019 and and 2020. Uh I think right before the pandemic, I was in New York. Uh and and I remember that visit because it was sort of like before everything got weird. We announced 10 million approved accounts on the platform, which was a crazy number for us. But um Robin Hood was already quite big even even before the pandemic started. So we had 10 million approved accounts. It was like pretty clear that we had created sort of the new era of retail investing because before the pandemic we were a series D company. So like latestage private company. I think the valuation was something like 7 billion. We had a few hundred million in annual run rate revenue and basically the entire industry ended up having to replicate our business model in order to survive and not all of them could survive as independent entities.</p>
</details>

基本上，整个行业最终不得不复制我们的商业模式才能生存，而且并非所有公司都能作为独立实体生存下来。你知道，**TD Ameritrade**（德美利证券）不得不并入**Schwab**（嘉信理财）。**E*Trade**（亿创理财），作为上一个散户交易颠覆时代，也就是.com时代的领导者，不得不并入**Morgan Stanley**（摩根士丹利）才能作为独立公司生存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know TDMIR trade had to get folded into Schwab. Erade, which was sort of like the the leader of the prior disruptive era in retail trading, which was the the.com era, had to get folded into Morgan Stanley to to survive as a standalone company. And so we we were already, I mean, we we had already accelerated and kind of turned back the clock.</p>
</details>

所以我们已经，我的意思是，我们已经加速发展，并且扭转了局面。每个人都说散户交易和投资已经结束了。每个人都在投资**ETF**（Exchange Traded Fund: 交易所交易基金，一种在交易所上市交易的基金）。被动投资是新趋势。所以当时有很多怀疑，但我们扭转了这种局面。然后疫情爆发了，我们几乎所有业务指标都增长了一个数量级，而我们原本认为这些指标已经表现良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone was saying retail trading and investing was over. Everyone was indexing into ETFs. Passive was the new thing. So there was a lot of skepticism, but we we kind of inverted that. And then you had the pandemic where pretty much across all of our business metrics, which we already thought were doing well, we kind of increased an order of magnitude.</p>
</details>

我认为疫情导致客户行为的变化是一个复杂的问题，因为自那时以来宏观经济发生了太多事情，而且我们有许多不同类型的客户。所以，如果过于简化，你可以将Robinhood的客户分为两类截然不同的群体。一类是活跃交易者。为了打个赛车运动的比方，活跃交易者就像是车迷，他们关心性能。他们关心拥有真正快速的汽车。他们希望走在技术和创新的前沿。这些人会在**Wall Street Bets**（华尔街赌场：Reddit上的一个热门论坛，散户投资者在此讨论股票和期权交易）上发布亏损截图，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the behavior of customers as a result of the pandemic is a bit of an intricate question because there have been so many things that happened in the macro since then and we have so many different types of customers. So to like dramatically oversimplify, you could think of Robin Hood as having two diametrically different classes of customers. One is the active trader. Uh and and these are the folks to to give like a motorport analogy, right? The active traders are the folks that are like motorheads like they care about performance. They care about having like really fast cars. They want to be at the frontier of technology and innovation. These are the people posting lost porn on Wall Street Bets, right?</p>
</details>

不一定。我想其中一些是。我认为这更普遍。我们稍后也可以谈谈“亏损截图”吗？我对那个很着迷。但请继续。请继续。这些人就像是全副武装，有九个屏幕。他们正在监控情况。没错。他们中的一些人非常老练和富有，甚至拥有**Bloomberg terminal**（彭博终端：一种计算机系统，为金融专业人士提供实时市场数据、新闻和分析工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not necessarily. I think some of them are. I think that that's a more general Can we talk about lost porn later, too? I'm fascinated by that. But yeah, keep going. Keep going. These are the folks that are like strapped into their battle stations and have like nine. They're monitoring the situation. Exactly. Some of them are incredibly sophisticated and wealthy and they even have Bloomberg terminals or good. It would have been sort of like the Bloomberg terminal customer and and so that's like a higher net worth very active group small group but premium and then we have to to come back to the motorsport analogy the folks that buy minivans right the mass market they just want to invest they want a relatively hands-free and sort of like low friction way of investing and saving for the long term And we we have products that serve both of those.</p>
</details>

所以，那就像是彭博终端的客户，这是一个高净值、非常活跃但规模较小的优质群体。然后，回到赛车运动的比喻，我们有购买小型货车的人，也就是大众市场，他们只是想投资，想要一种相对省心、低摩擦的长期投资和储蓄方式。我们有服务于这两类客户的产品。所以我们希望在活跃交易者市场中成为第一。我们正在迅速获得市场份额。但我们也希望成为千禧一代和Z世代客户存放所有财富的地方。所以你把银行账户的钱直接存入那里。你用我们的信用卡进行所有消费。当然，你进行交易，但你也有退休账户，以及你的长期被动投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So we we want to be number one in the active trader market. We're rapidly we're rapidly gaining market share there. But also we want to be the place where if you're a millennial or Gen Z customer, you put all of your wealth. So you deposit your bank account uh direct deposit in there. You do all of your spending with us with our credit card. Of course, you do your trading, but you also have your retirement account, your long-term passive investments as well.</p>
</details>

所以，我们专注于这两类客户，他们拥有截然不同的客户基础。我说这是过于简化了，因为你也有同时拥有这两种行为的客户。所以我们很多活跃交易者也需要银行工具，他们需要消费，他们也有一个被动投资组合，可能在其他地方规模更大，但并非每个人都是活跃交易者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're kind of focused on both of these things with two very different customer bases. And I say it's oversimplifying because you also have customers that have both of these behaviors. So a lot of our active traders, they also need banking tools, they need spending, they have a passive portfolio which can be larger elsewhere, but not everyone is an active trader.</p>
</details>

而且，自疫情以来，利率经历了剧烈波动，从低利率、零利率环境，这使得股票和更具投机性、高增长的投资更具吸引力。但随后我们又迅速转向了数十年来最高的利率环境。Robinhood不得不迅速而积极地应对，以在这种环境中生存。我们推出了退休账户等产品，以及业内最高的现金**APY**（Annual Percentage Yield: 年化收益率），这样你的现金在账户中也能赚取利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so um also since co you had a whipssaw of low rates, zero interest rate environment, which made stocks and more speculative, higher growth investments more attractive. But then we whipsaw to the highest interest rate environment we've seen in multiple decades. And then Robin Hood had to respond very rapidly and aggressively to survive in that environment. And we introduced things like retirement like the highest APY in the industry on cash so that you could earn interest while your cash was sitting there.</p>
</details>

我们还对业务进行了大量多元化，这样我们的客户在那个时期对交易兴趣降低时，也能找到利用环境并利用他们的策略获利的方法。我知道你最初的竞争优势之一是零交易费，但除此之外，我在开场白中提到，我真的认为Robinhood是一个关于用户界面重要性的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know just a ton of diversification of the business so that our customers who became less interested in trading during that time Yeah. could could find ways to, you know, t take advantage of the environment and capitalize with their strategies. So, I know one of the um initial competitive advantages you had was the the zero trading fees, but beyond that, you know, I mentioned in the intro that like I honestly think Robin Hood is sort of a I guess a story about the importance of user interface.</p>
</details>

有些人会说这是一件好事。你知道，用户可以相对快速地转账。设置和执行交易非常容易。你基本上可以在酒吧或餐厅里，不用打太多字就能完成交易。但是，你知道，屏幕本身也非常多彩。它拍照效果很好，所以人们可以将这些截图发布到**Wall Street Bets**等论坛上。我想我的问题是，你将公司的成功归因于用户界面，或者股票市场交易的**游戏化**（Gamification: 将游戏设计元素和游戏原则应用于非游戏环境），你在恰到好处的时机充分利用了这一点，这在多大程度上超越了老牌竞争对手？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some people would say that's a great thing. You know, users can come on and you can transfer money relatively quickly. Um, it's very easy to set up and execute a trade. You can basically do it without typing very much while you're sitting at a bar or in a restaurant or whatever. But, you know, you also have things like the screen itself is very colorful. It photographs well so that people can post those screenshots on forums like Wall Street Bets. I guess my question is like to what extent would you attribute the success of the company versus old school competitors to that user interface or maybe the gamification of stock market trading which you really you know you played into at exactly the right moment.</p>
</details>

我拒绝“游戏化”这个前提。你认为这款应用设计得不好吗？我认为它设计得很好，但当我想起……显然我从小就是个玩家，所以我对传统的游戏化有所研究。当你提到游戏化时，对我来说，它意味着排行榜、社交动态，人们声称我们做了所有这些，但我们实际上什么都没做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I reject the uh gamification premise. Um you don't think uh the the app is designed really well. I think it's designed well, but I think when when I think about So, obviously I grew up as a as a gamer, so I'm I'm a bit of a a student of traditional gamification. And when you say gamification, to me it means, you know, leaderboards, social dynamics, and people claim we do all of that, but we actually do none of it.</p>
</details>

我认为Robinhood早期成功的原因是我们提供了别人没有的东西，那就是**免佣金交易**（Commission-free trading: 经纪商不收取交易手续费）。我认为现实是，如果我查看Robinhood应用的设计和旧截图，我不认为它特别容易使用。我的意思是，它可能比竞争对手更容易使用，因为我们并不是真正与以用户界面闻名的传统技术公司竞争，但我认为现实是，价值主张如此强大，以至于人们可以忍受用户界面中的许多粗糙之处，只为了获得核心价值，那就是免佣金交易和投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the reason Robin Hood was successful in the early days is that we offered something that nobody else offered, which was commission-free trading. And I I think the reality is if I look at the design of the Robin Hood app and old screenshots of it, I don't think it was particularly easy to use. I mean, it was easier to use than the competition maybe because we weren't really competing against traditional technology companies that are known for user interface, but but I think the reality was that the value proposition was so strong that people could actually put up with a lot of cruff in the user interface to just get the the core value which which was commission free trading and investing.</p>
</details>

我认为随着时间的推移，我们独特的免佣金交易变得普遍，出现了一种竞争动态，即服务会减少摩擦，这是一种自然的力量，使服务变得更少摩擦、更容易使用。我认为你在各个行业都能看到这一点，这仅仅来自于密切关注用户，了解他们的痛点，并建立一个系统，系统地减少这些痛点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think over time what happens is as sort of like the unique thing we had commission free trading became universal there was like a competitive dynamic where the the services that reduce friction there's just a natural force to to make the services less frictionful and more easy to use and and I think you kind of see that across industries and that just comes from paying close attention to the users looking at their pain points and having a system where you just like systematically reduce those pain points.</p>
</details>

我们确实花时间与用户坐在一起，观察他们使用产品，发现他们感到困惑的地方，并努力解决。我认为你在任何技术公司都会看到这一点，但现在大多数公司都已成为技术公司。任何做得不错的公司，我认为都会达到一个水平，他们会进行用户反馈并根据反馈进行设计迭代。如果你现在不这样做，你将无法在市场中生存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like we we literally spend time sitting with users watching them use the product, see the points where they get confused and and try to try to fix it. And and I think you'll see that in in any technology company, but you know, most companies have become technology companies at this point. any any company that's like doing a reasonable job, I think, will will come to the level where they're actually doing user feedback and iterations on design based on it. If you don't do that nowadays, you'll you'll essentially not survive in the in the marketplace.</p>
</details>

回到2020年或2021年的那批人，你提到了一些有趣的事情，就是有些人进行交易，同时也有更被动的长期投资组合，你知道，人们两者兼顾。成熟这个词，我不知道，有点居高临下，但从某种意义上说，这个群体是否已经成熟了？那些最初因为觉得有趣、刺激或无聊而开始交易的客户，随着时间的推移，他们是否也意识到长期买入持有和指数化也是一个好主意？你是否看到这个群体在他们感兴趣的方面有所增长？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just going back though to that um 2021 or 2020 cohort, you said something interesting which is that some people trade and they have like a more passive long-term book there, you know, not uh people people do both. The word maturation, I don't know, a little condescending, but has there been a maturation of that base in some sense where people who initially got into trading because it looked fun or was exciting or they were bored, etc. Those customers over time of like, oh, and also long-term buy and hold and indexing is also something that's probably a good idea. Like, do you see growth among that cohort in terms of what they're interested in? Generally every person ends up have having a need to invest now like an actual invest not just trade when you say yeah yeah so not everyone actually sticks with trading and becomes an active trader.</p>
</details>

通常每个人最终都需要投资，是真正的投资，而不仅仅是交易。当你提到……是的，所以并非每个人都坚持交易并成为活跃交易者。很多人一开始更积极地交易，然后最终转向更被动的投资。很有趣。主要是因为如果你和这些人交谈，他们不想花时间去研究。他们有其他事情要做。所以他们更喜欢所有投资都是自动化的。有些人最终会进行大量交易。我确实相信这是一种你可以真正提高和改进的技能。你知道，并非每个人都愿意投入时间和精力去做这件事。所以我们为这些人提供其他工具，比如退休账户。我们推出了一款新产品，叫做**Robinhood Strategies**（Robinhood策略：一种数字投资顾问产品），你只需存入资金，它就会为你投资，当然还会给你回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh a lot of people trade more actively at first and then eventually end up doing like more passive investing. Interesting. mostly because they don't, if you talk to these people, they don't want to put in the time to like spend. They have other things to do. So, they prefer all of their investments to be hands-off. Some people end up trading a lot. And I I do believe that it's a skill that you could actually get better at and improve at. And, you know, not not everyone actually wants to put in the time and effort to do that. And so we serve those people with other tools, you know, retirement accounts. We have a new product that we rolled out called Robin Hood strategies that you just deposit money and it'll invest for you and of course give you the rale.</p>
</details>

那像**跟单交易**（Copy Trading: 自动复制其他成功交易者的交易策略）吗，还是不同？这是一款**数字投顾产品**（Digital Advisory Product: 通过算法和自动化提供投资建议和管理服务）。好的。所以这是一个……是的，我们有一个注册投资顾问，它会进行投资。它更接近于**Betterment**（一家知名的智能投顾公司）或类似的业务，那种**智能投顾**（Robo-advisor: 提供自动化、算法驱动的投资组合管理服务）模式吗？是的，它类似于智能投顾，但有一些有趣的元素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that like copy trading or is this different? It's it's a digital advisory product. Okay. So it's a uh yeah we have a registered investment advisor and it will just invest. Is it closer to like Betterment or something like that sort of business like the sort of robo? Yeah, it's similar to a robo except there's a couple of interesting elements.</p>
</details>

一个是你的费用是封顶的。如果你账户里有10万美元，每年费用上限为250美元。所以大多数智能投顾产品，尽管比传统顾问成本低，但你投入的资金越多，费用就越高。我们认为这从根本上是错误的。当你投入更多资金时，服务应该对你更有吸引力。你应该觉得你获得了更多价值，因为与Robinhood的整体关系更有价值。所以我们有点颠覆了这个模式，使得从百分比来看，你拥有的资金越多，费用就越便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One is your fee is capped. It's capped at $250 per year if you have 100,000 in your account. So most robo products, even though they're lower cost than traditional advisors, get more expensive for you the more money you put in there. And and we thought that was like fundamentally broken. As you put more money, the service should get more compelling for you. you should feel like you're getting more value because the overall relationship to Robin Hood is is much more valuable. So we sort of like inverted the model so that it actually on a percentage basis gets cheaper the more money you have.</p>
</details>

然后，每当你的投资组合发生变化时，我们还会提供个性化的洞察。你可以阅读关于它的信息，了解我们为什么做出这些改变，你还可以通过音频收听我们的解释，这在我们的客户中非常受欢迎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then uh also we have these personalized insights every time something happens to your portfolio. You can read about it and why we made that change and you can also listen to us explain it via audio which has been really really popular for uh for our customers.</p>
</details>

这引出了我真正想问你的问题，那就是你现在正在做所有这些不同的事情，并且你显然有雄心成为满足所有人金融需求的一站式商店。你如何决定要扩展到哪些新产品或新功能？是这样一种情况吗，比如人们在平台上交易，所以他们可能对某种智能投顾服务感兴趣？还是你关注竞争格局，然后认为，嗯，这家公司正在使用**Cobol**（COBOL: 一种古老的编程语言，常用于大型机金融系统），他们无法用新的技术栈做我们能做的事情，所以那里存在机会？你如何评估所有这些不同的机会，然后最终决定你想做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this leads into something that I want to ask you actually which is you're doing all these different things now and you clearly have ambitions to be a sort of like one-stop shop for everyone's financial needs. How do you actually decide which new products or which new capabilities to expand into? Is it a case of like okay well people are on the platform they're trading so maybe they would be interested in some sort of robo advisory service or is it you look at the competitive landscape and you think like well this company has you know they're using cobalt or something like that and they can't do what we can do with a new tech stack and so there's an opportunity there. How do you assess all those different opportunities then ultimately decide what you want to do?</p>
</details>

是的，基本上我们的业务战略分为三个阶段，你可以将其与时间范围弧线对齐。所以我们有一个近期弧线，我们现在正处于高潮，那就是成为活跃交易者的第一平台。如果你是一个活跃交易者，你知道，如果你是那种面前有六个终端，有自己的战斗站的人，哦，是的，我们想明确表示，使用任何其他平台都会让你处于劣势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, basically our business strategy falls into three buckets and you can kind of align that with time horizon arcs. So we have sort of like a near-term arc which we're in the climax of right now which is to be the number one platform for active traders. If you're an active trader, you know, if you're one of these people that has the six terminals in front of you and you've got your battle station, oh yeah, we want to make it clear that you're at a disadvantage using any other platform.</p>
</details>

这些人走在技术和创新的前沿。所以，**Robinhood 24小时市场**（Robinhood 24-hour market: Robinhood提供的24小时交易服务）就是一个例子。这不仅仅是提供更好的工具和界面，尽管那是其中一部分。它还包括提供其他地方没有的东西。24小时市场可能是最好的例子。这已经变得非常非常受欢迎。如果你不使用Robinhood，你实际上处于劣势，因为如果你需要在周日晚上管理风险，我们的平台提供股票市场的访问权限，而这些在其他地方不容易找到。所以这是近期弧线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And these folks are at the frontier of technology and innovation. So, uh 24 so uh Robin Hood 24-hour market is an example there. It's not just about better tools and interfaces, although that's a part of it. It's also having things that are not available elsewhere. 24-hour market being probably the best example there. And that's that's become very very popular. And you're literally at a disadvantage if you're not using Robin Hood because if you need to manage your risk on a Sunday night, our our platform offers access to equity markets and you know those aren't easily found elsewhere. So that's the near-term arc.</p>
</details>

### Robinhood的未来发展弧线与代币化战略

然后我们有一个中期五年弧线，那就是在下一代钱包份额中成为第一。目前是**千禧一代**（Millennials: 大约出生于1981年至1996年）和**Z世代**（Gen Z: 大约出生于1997年至2012年）。但我们也不想只停留在千禧一代和Z世代的范畴。我们希望随着下一代的需求演变，始终保持相关性。当然。是的。等等，**Alpha世代**（Gen Alpha: 大约出生于2010年之后）。你说你是哪个世代？我是**X世代**（Gen X: 大约出生于1965年至1980年）。你是X世代。嗯，你是在另一个方向，更接近Alpha世代。我以为你说你很年轻。不，不，不。我想确保仍然有金融服务能满足老年人的需求。不，不。X世代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then we have sort of a medium five-year arc which is being number one in wallet share for the next generation. And that's millennials and Gen Z for now. But we don't want to also get stuck in the millennial and Gen Z bucket. We We always want to be relevant to the needs of the next generation as they evolve. Of course. Yes. Wait alpha. What generation are you saying you are? I'm Gen X. You're Gen X. Well, you're in the other direction more Gen Alpha. I thought you were saying that you're really young. No, no, no. I want to make sure that there's still financial services that cater to old people. No, no. Gen Gen X. I I would say it's a simplification.</p>
</details>

我想说这是一种简化。我的意思是，有X世代和**婴儿潮一代**（Baby Boomers: 大约出生于1946年至1964年）喜欢Robinhood。我认为共同点实际上不是你的年龄，而是你的数字素养。比如，如果你习惯在手机上进行数字银行和金融服务，你知道，你可能80岁了，但仍然非常喜欢Robinhood，但有些人，尤其是老年人，更喜欢亲自去和人交谈。我认为我们在开发这类服务方面是落后的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, there's Gen X and and baby boomers that love Robin Hood. I think the the common ground is actually less your age and more how digitally savvy you are. Like, if you're comfortable doing digital banking and financial services on your phone, you know, you could be 80 years old and really enjoy Robin Hood, but you know, some people, particularly as they're older, prefer to go in person and uh talk to a human. And I think we're a lagard in developing those types of services.</p>
</details>

所以第二个弧线，中期弧线，即成为你存放所有资金的地方，我们基本上会关注几件事。一是人们将资金提取到哪里？如果你将资金从Robinhood中取出去做某事，我们能否在我们的生态系统中更好地服务这一点？所以，你知道，例如，很多人从Robinhood中取出资金来支付账单。所以我们看到了这一点，并认为这是一个很好的机会，可以让他们通过我们支付账单。因此，我们推出了**Robinhood Gold卡**（Robinhood Gold card: Robinhood推出的信用卡产品），在我看来，我有点偏见，它是市场上最好的信用卡，优势非常大。所有类别都有3%的现金返还，这通常只有高净值人士才能获得，再加上一个非常好的用户界面，可以让你按需创建虚拟卡。你可以添加你的全家人，帮助他们建立信用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the the second arc, medium-term arc of being the place where we put all of your money, we basically look at uh a few things there. One is where are people withdrawing to? If you take your money out of Robin Hood to do something, can we just better serve that within our ecosystem? So, you know, for example, a lot of people took money off of Robin Hood to pay their bills. So, we saw that and we thought that was a great opportunity to just allow them to pay their bills via us. So, we launched the Robin Hood Gold card, which, you know, in my opinion, I'm I'm biased, is the best credit card on the market by a wide margin. 3% cash back on all categories, which you have to be a high net worth individual to get, coupled with a very nice user interface that lets you create virtual cards on demand. You can add your whole family, help them build their credit. So that that's just an example of of how we think about it.</p>
</details>

但这只是我们思考方式的一个例子。对于这些产品中的每一个，我认为仅仅提出类别是不够的。我认为我们必须有一个很好的想法，如何为用户改善经济效益，以及如何改善用户体验。当我们拥有这种组合时，我认为这就是Robinhood产品成功的要素。我应该提一下第三个弧线，因为那是长期目标，鉴于我们刚刚在法国南部举行的活动，它非常相关。它被称为“构建全球第一金融生态系统”，这意味着什么……是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But for each of these products individually, I don't think it's enough to come up with the category. I think we have to have a great idea for how we can make the economics better for users and also how to make the user experience better. And when we have that combination, I think that's the ingredient to a successful Robin Hood product. I should mention the third arc because that's the long-term one and it's pretty relevant here given the uh event we just had in the south of France. It's called building the number one global financial ecosystem and what that means that's all just that. Yes.</p>
</details>

所以这是一个长期弧线。所以它需要一段时间，大概10年，但基本上它涉及Robinhood沿着两个线性独立的向量进行扩展。一个是从仅限美国到完全全球化，另一个是从仅限零售到商业和机构。这就是我们真正进入有趣的平台方面，比如**代币化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的权利或价值数字化，并在区块链上发行代币）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's a long-term arc. So it's going to take a while uh like 10 years but basically it involves expanding Robin Hood across two linearly independent vectors. One is from US only to fully global and the other is from retail only to business and institutional and that's where we get into really interesting platform aspects like tokenization.</p>
</details>

所以，跟我谈谈股权代币化。我的问题是，在哪一年？告诉我股权代币化。你知道，想想**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种加密货币，其价值与法定货币或其他稳定资产挂钩）就是代币化的美元，对吧？所以显然你可以做同样的事情，比如拥有**特斯拉**（Tesla: 一家电动汽车和清洁能源公司）等股票的加密货币形式，等等。它可以在链上24/7交易。在哪一年我将能够24/7在链上交易任何股票？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let me talk to me about equity tokeniz. Here's my question. In what year? Tell me about equity tokenization. You know, thinking about like a a stable coin is a tokenized dollar, right? And so obviously a you could do the same thing where you have like a a stock Tesla whatever and crypto forum, etc. And it trades on a chain 24/7. In what year will I be able to trade any stock 24/7 onchain?</p>
</details>

嗯，如果你是欧洲客户，那肯定是在2025年。所以，我们在法国南部举行的“捕捉代币”活动中宣布的是Robinhood的股票代币，它们本质上是代币化的**美国股票**（US Equities: 美国公司的股票）和ETF。我们还赠送了**SpaceX**（太空探索技术公司：一家私营航天制造商和空间运输服务公司）的代币化股票，这非常令人兴奋。而且，这两项技术现在都已准备就绪。它适用于代币化股票。你现在可以24/5交易它们，但24/7将在未来几个月内实现。我们还将解锁完整的链上功能。所以，交换、抵押借贷，以及你在**DeFi**（Decentralized Finance: 去中心化金融，基于区块链的金融服务）中可以做的任何事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if you are a European customer, definitely 2025. So, what we announced in in our event to catch a token in the south of France is stock tokens by Robin Hood, which are essentially tokenized US equities and ETFs. Uh we also did a giveaway of tokenized shares of SpaceX, which is very exciting. And that the the technology for both is ready right now. It's working for tokenized equities. You can trade them 245 right now, but 247 is coming over the next few months. And we'll also unlock full onchain capabilities. So, swapping, collateralized lending and borrowing, anything you can do in DeFi.</p>
</details>

所以，在美国的采用障碍，是的，有点像我们看到的稳定币的情况。技术已经存在。它在欧洲可用。它将在许多司法管辖区可用。这完全是监管清晰度的问题，我们希望今年晚些时候能实现，但绝不是技术障碍。如果不是真正解决技术问题，而是监管问题，那么代币化为什么是其中一部分呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the barrier to adoption in the US, yeah, kind of mirrors what we saw in stablecoin. The technology is there. It's it's available in Europe. It'll be available in a bunch of jurisdictions. It's all just regulatory clarity, which we're we're hopeful will come later this year, but uh it's not a technological barrier by any means. Why is tokenization a part of it if we're not really solving a technological problem, but a regulatory problem?</p>
</details>

嗯，代币化解决了许多问题，但要使其在美国可用，必要的环节本质上是一个监管问题。我们只需要加密货币监管的规则，以及私人股票方面，这也是一个有趣的元素，因为在那里你开始真正看到代币化的好处。代币化能做什么或让你做什么？是的。所以代币化将资产放到链上，本质上使其可以24/7交易，就像股票或加密资产一样。所以你可以在加密货币交易所买卖它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, tokenization solves a lot of problems, but the necessary piece to make it available to the US is is essentially a regulatory issue. We just need rules of crypto regulation and for the private stock side which is also an interesting element because there you start to really see the benefits of tokenization. What does tokenization do or allow you to do? Yeah. So tokenization takes an asset and puts it on chain and essentially uh makes it tradable 24/7 just like a stock or a crypto asset would be. So you can buy or sell it on a crypto exchange.</p>
</details>

我可以买卖股票，对吧？我们在这里做什么？代币化实现了什么，是你不能在一个可以买卖股票的数据库上做到的？是的。好问题。我认为答案略有不同，如果我们谈论的是美国客户和国际客户。我来解释一下原因。在美国，我们已经有一个相当强大的金融系统。Robinhood存在，你可以在Robinhood上开户并购买股票。你可以24/5购买它们，这已经很不错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can buy or sell a stock, right? Like what are we doing here? What is the tokenization accomplish that you can't just do on a database that you can buy stock on? Yeah. So good question. I think the answer is slightly different if we're talking about a customer in the US versus internationally. And I'll explain why. So in the US, we already have a pretty robust financial system. Uh Robin Hood exists right and you can onboard on Robin Hood and buy stocks. You can buy them 245 which is pretty good.</p>
</details>

所以，代币化体验与你目前拥有的体验之间的差异将是扩展到24/7，并且最终当我们接入**DeFi**（去中心化金融）时，将所有DeFi功能（目前有点小众但功能强大）提供出来。所以，抵押借贷，**自托管**（Self-custody: 用户自己保管加密资产的私钥，而不是将其交给第三方托管），自托管很有趣。所以现在你的股票在Robinhood或其他券商账户中，有点被锁定在经纪商那里，对吧？所以假设那个经纪商出现问题，比如技术故障。你就有点被困住了。但如果股票被代币化，不仅可以无缝地使用另一个经纪商，你只需连接到你的钱包，而且可靠性会高得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there the delta between token the tokenized experience and what you have currently would be expanding to 24/7 and also eventually when we plug into DeFi making all of the DeFi aspects which are right now a little bit more niche but incredibly powerful available. So collateralized lending and borrowing self-custody self-custody is interesting. So right now your stock in your Robin Hood or or other brokerage account is kind of locked into a broker, right? So let's say that broker has issues like a tech technical outage. You're kind of stuck. But if the stock were to be tokenized, not only would it become seamless to use another broker, you just kind of attach to your wallet, but the reliability would be much higher.</p>
</details>

我也不必担心在传统券商持有股票时丢失我的**助记词**（Seed Phrase: 一串单词，用于恢复加密货币钱包的访问权限）。如果人们交易代币化股票，他们是否需要考虑这个问题？对于传统资产来说，这不那么令人担忧，因为总会有一个过程来连接你的代币与真实资产。所以，你知道，这对于**比特币**（Bitcoin: 一种去中心化的数字加密货币）来说是一个大问题。例如，因为没有物理表示。但如果你有代币化的美元或资产，你将能够通过一个过程来认领实际的真实物品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also don't have to worry about losing my seed phrase when I have stock in a traditional brokerage. Is that something that people are going to have to think about if they're trading tokenized equity? It's less concerning with traditional assets because there's always going to be a process to connect your token with the real asset. So, you know, it's it's a big problem with Bitcoin. Yeah. For example, because there's no like physical representation. But if you have a tokenized dollar or an asset, you will be able to there will be a process where you can claim the actual real thing.</p>
</details>

抱歉，再追问一下。我试图理解。好的，代币化股票，它将……你使用的是哪个链？最初是**Arbitrum**（Arbitrum: 以太坊的第二层扩容解决方案），但不会持续太久。我们实际上正在推出自己的**区块链**（Blockchain: 一种去中心化的分布式账本技术）。哦，你将有一个基础竞争对手。是的，在某种程度上。我的意思是，它只是在Arbitrum之上构建的一个分层。它将建立在**以太坊**（Ethereum: 一个开源的区块链平台）之上。它是一个**第二层**（Layer 2: 建立在第一层区块链之上的扩容解决方案，旨在提高交易速度和降低成本）。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry, just to press on this further. I'm trying to understand. Okay, so a tokenized equity and it's going to I think what's the chain you're using? Arbitum like uh arbitum at first, but not for long. We're we're actually rolling out our own blockchain. Oh, you're going to have a base competitor. Yeah, in in a way. I mean it's just a layered build on top of arbitum though. Uh it's it's going to be on top of Ethereum. It's a layer two. So Okay.</p>
</details>

所以你正在构建你自己的以太坊第二层，撇开欧洲或美国不谈。印度尼西亚的某个随机的人，如果他们有一些**USDC**（USD Coin: 一种与美元挂钩的稳定币），他们最终能否与此互动并获得特斯拉的敞口？是的，这就是计划。所以现在，如果我想通过Robinhood拥有特斯拉股票，我需要告诉你我的名字，并且我大概会提供一些身份信息等等。但将来，理论上任何人都可以获得这些资产的敞口，而无需透露任何关于自己的信息，因为他们只是在链上进行**匿名**（Pseudo-anonymously: 假名地，指在网络上使用化名或匿名身份）互动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're building you're you're building your own Ethereum layer 2 setting aside Europe or the United States. Random person who has uh some USDC in Indonesia, will they be able to interact with this and then have Tesla exposure eventually? Yes, that's the plan. And so like right now if I want to own Tesla shares through Robin Hood like I tell you my name and I presumably give you some identifying information etc. But in the future in theory anyone will be able to get exposure to these assets without actually having to reveal anything about themselves because they're just interacting pseudo anonymously on chain.</p>
</details>

在很大程度上，是的。有一些注意事项，取决于司法管辖区，我们可能需要对体验的某些元素进行**KYC**（Know Your Customer: 了解你的客户，金融机构对客户身份进行验证的过程）。例如，铸造和销毁实际的实物股票，并将其来回转换为代币，可能需要KYC。但是的，就像你可以在链上传输代币化稳定币一样，你也可以同样地传输代币化股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In large part, yes. There's some caveats where depending on the jurisdiction, we might have to like KYC some elements of the experience. For example, minting and burning the actual physical stocks uh and turning them back and forth into tokens will likely require KYC. But yeah, in the same way that you can transfer a tokenized stable coin on chain, you'll be able to transfer tokenized stocks identically.</p>
</details>

而且，就像稳定币之所以在非美国地区首先获得更广泛的普及，仅仅是因为在非美国地区更难获得美元一样，我认为代币化股票也将在非美国地区获得大量采用，然后其好处和技术才会惠及美国，并颠覆这里的结构。所以，明确地说，如果我拥有代币化股票，我可以**质押**（Staking: 将加密货币锁定在区块链网络中以支持其运作并获得奖励），对吧，并用它来做其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And kind of in the same for the same reasons that stable coins have become more popular and have really gained mass adoption outside of the US first, just because outside of the US it's much harder to get a hold of US dollars. tokenized stocks I think will gain a ton of adoption outside of the US before the benefits and the technology acrewing to the US and and kind of disrupting the the the structure here. And so just to be clear, if I have a tokenized stock, I can stake that, right, and use it to do other things.</p>
</details>

你将能够连接它，是的，连接到所有DeFi功能。现在，这些具体是什么，我认为我们将有一个开发者生态系统，他们将不得不构建一大堆东西，但是的，你可以把它放入池中，放入抵押借贷池中。质押很有趣，因为从技术上讲，质押是投入代币和资源来支持网络本身。所以当你提到质押股票时，很多人实际上是指借出它，我认为这最终将能够实现。但你是否可以质押它来支持网络？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You will be able to connect it Yeah. to to all of the DeFi capabilities. Now, exactly what those are, I think we're we're going to have a developer ecosystem and they're going to have to build a whole bunch of things, but yeah, you you can put it in pools into collateralized lending pools. Staking is interesting because technically staking is dedicating tokens and resources to support the network itself. And and so when when you say staking a stock, a lot of people actually mean lending it, which which I think will be able to to be done eventually.</p>
</details>

有点老派。我认为实际运作方式是，你必须将其转换为网络**Gas代币**（Gas Token: 用于支付区块链网络交易费用的代币），然后你才能进行质押。但我认为现在谈论这个还为时过早。所以你提到你只会在Arbitrum上做一段时间，然后会过渡到你自己的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um could you stake it to support the network? Sort of old school as well. I think the way that that would actually work is you'd have to convert that into the network gas token. Um and and you would stake it that way, but I think it's a little bit early for us to to get into yet. So you mentioned that you're only doing this on arbitrum for a short amount of time and then you're transitioning to to your own tech.</p>
</details>

为什么？我想这是我的问题。为什么从那里开始，然后做你自己的第二层，而不是直接从你自己的东西开始？我认为目标是真正使其成为真实世界资产的最佳链。所以我们从股票开始。我们也在做私人股票。但我们希望将人们想要交易的一切都代币化。所以你可以想象未来的房地产。你可以想象碳信用。真的什么都可以。但如果你要使用以太坊，为什么不直接从以太坊开始，而不是Arbitrum呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why? I guess is my question. like why start there um and then do your your own um layer versus just starting out with your own thing. I think that the um the ambition is to actually make this the best chain for real world assets. So we're starting with stocks. We're also doing private stocks as well. But we we want to tokenize everything that people would want to make tradable. So you can imagine real estate in the future. You can imagine carbon credits. Uh really anything. But if you're going to use Ethereum, then why not start out with Ethereum rather than Arbitum?</p>
</details>

以太坊是基础**第一层**（Layer 1: 指区块链网络的基础层，如以太坊本身）。直接在以太坊上交易的问题是费用可能相当高。所以这就是为什么Arbitrum，作为以太坊之上的一层，能够基本上整合大量交易，并以不频繁的频率同步到基础第一层链。哦，我明白了。这样你就可以将原本高昂的交易费分摊到大量小额交易中，从而将成本从，你知道，高拥堵时以太坊每笔交易可能高达数美元，降低到几美分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum is is the base layer one. And the problem with transacting directly on Ethereum is that it the the fees can be quite high. So that that's why Arbitum, which is a layer on top of Ethereum, they they've been able to essentially consolidate lots and lots of transactions and sync up to the base layer 1 chain at an infrequent cadence. Oh, I see. And that way you can kind of like split up what would be a large transaction fee into lots and lots of small transactions and get the cost down from, you know, high cone high congestion. you know, Ethereum could be multiples, multiple dollars per transaction down to like individual cents, you know, a handful of cents.</p>
</details>

我知道我们已经讨论这个问题很多年了，但**Gas费**（Gas Fees: 在区块链网络上执行交易或智能合约所需的费用）会怎样？如果这个服务真的普及并被大众使用，会怎样？是的，我的意思是，Gas费非常可扩展。作为链上层的一部分好处是，在某种程度上，我们将运行**排序器**（Sequencers: 在Layer 2网络中负责收集、排序和批量处理交易的组件），我们将能够处理Gas费。我认为目标是使这基本上是零交易成本或非常非常低的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know we've been having this conversation for years now, but what happens to the gas fees? What if this really takes off and people start using this service on mass? Yeah, I mean uh the gas the gas fees are very scalable. Part part of the benefits of being a layer on top of the chain is to some degree we we'll be running sequencers and we'll be able to to handle the gas fees. And I think that the the goal would be for for this to be essentially transaction cost free or very very low cost.</p>
</details>

显然，作为核心公司竞争优势的一部分是构建技术，对吧？构建……你几年前做的一件事是构建了你自己的**清算堆栈**（Clearing Stack: 负责金融交易清算和结算的系统），而不是使用一些第三方公司，我忘了是哪家，你知道，在你对Robinhood的愿景中，你是否曾设想过将自己的一些技术**白标**（White-label: 指一家公司生产的产品或服务，由另一家公司贴牌销售）给其他公司？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you obviously as part of the core company competitive advantage is building tech, right? And building and one of the things that you did several years ago is you built your own clearing stack instead of um you know using uh some uh third party company, I forget what it was, you know, could you in your vision for Robin Hood, could you ever see whitelisting some of your own tech?</p>
</details>

你知道，我想到**亚马逊**（Amazon: 一家跨国科技巨头，业务涵盖电子商务、云计算等），它最终构建了自己的计算机，然后开始销售它们，然后开始销售其仓库容量。随着你建立这些能力，你是否会将其出售给其他**金融科技**（Fintech: 金融科技，指利用技术改进和自动化金融服务）公司或提供对这些平台的访问权限？是的。我认为代币化股票是一个很好的例子。我认为这可以成为一个标准，如果你是另一家金融科技公司，你知道，你可能没有向客户提供股票。也许你有一个庞大的国际业务，你想添加股票。你只需与我们的链集成，然后这些股票就可以提供给你的客户。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, I think about like Amazon and eventually it built its own computers and then it started selling them and then it started selling its warehouse capacity.

I think that that could become a standard if you're another fintech Yeah. and you know you're you you may not be offering stocks to your customers. Maybe you have a big international presence and you want to add stocks. Uh you would just be able to integrate with our chain and then those stocks would be available to your customers.</p>

我们还有一项名为Robinhood Connect的服务，它基本上将我们为自己的第一方应用精心优化的交易服务提供给第三方开发者。所以，如果你是像**Moonshot**、**Uniswap**或**MetaMask**这样的**非托管钱包**（Non-custodial Wallet: 用户完全控制私钥和加密资产的钱包）提供商，你就会面临一个问题，即如何简化人们将美元转换为加密货币，以及如果他们想的话再转换回美元的过程。

<p class="english-text">We also have a service called Robin Hood Connect which essentially took um our trading services that were that we've optimized so finely for our own firstparty app and made them available to third party developers. So, if you're a non-custodial wallet provider like a Moonshot or Uniswap or MetaMask, uh you have this problem of how how do you streamline people getting their dollars into crypto and back out to dollars if they want to.</p>
</details>

所以Robinhood Connect提供最低的费率之一来完成这项工作，仅仅因为我们对此进行了大量优化，以至于现在向第三方提供这项服务对我们来说很容易。所以我们将继续迭代。该链将是一个成熟的开发者平台，可供第三方使用，而且我们将来将继续寻找机会，让我们的技术，我不会称之为白标，但至少可以提供给机构和其他客户。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So Robin Hood Connect offers um you know one of the lowest rates to do that just because we've optimized that so much that you know handing that out and and giving that service to third parties is is now easy for us to do. So we're going to continue to to iterate on that. the chain will be full-fledged developer platform made available to third parties and uh we we always will continue to look for opportunities in the future to have our tech uh I I wouldn't call it white labeled but at least um made available to institutions and and other customers.</p>

你知道什么对我来说真的很有趣吗？我当时在想几年前加密货币开始兴起的时候，我曾经嘲笑那些人，当时加密货币开始兴起，你会看到这些会议，人们会在小组讨论中说，我们真的对区块链技术感兴趣，不是比特币，而是区块链。我从来不知道那是什么意思，而且它似乎也没有任何进展，它似乎只是一种方式，就像，好吧，如果我为一家大型传统金融机构工作，我想听起来很聪明。我想被邀请参加小组讨论。我说，哦，我们对这里的区块链非常兴奋。完全正确。但实际上，这听起来可能有点被证实了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what's really interesting to me? I was thinking about like several years ago when crypto started taking off and I used to make fun of these people when crypto start when crypto started taking off and you'd get these conferences and people would go on panels and they say well we're really we're really interested in blockchain technology bitcoin butchain we're really interested in blockchain technology not bitcoin and I never really knew what it meant and it didn't seem to go anywhere and it just seemed like a way like okay if I like worked for like a big whatever big legacy financial institution. I want to sound smart. I want to get invited to panels. I say like, "Oh, we're really excited about the blockchain here." Totally. But actually, it kind of sounds like maybe they're being vindicated a little bit.</p>
</details>

嗯，你注意到我没有使用“区块链”或“Web3”这个词，但你正在使用，我们正在谈论“链”这个概念。是的。而且我可能，我有点像坐在2025年，感觉也许我不应该像我过去那样嘲笑那些人，因为“链”本身，而不是“币”，似乎是很多行动发生的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you've noticed that I'm not using the word blockchain or web 3, but you're using we're talking about the you're talking about the ch the idea of chains. Yeah. And like I might like I'm kind of sitting here in 2025 and it's like maybe I shouldn't have made fun of those people as much as I did because it does seem like chains per se as opposed to coins are kind of where a lot of the action is.</p>
</details>

我认为你应该稍微嘲笑那些人，因为人们多年来一直在谈论这些东西。有很多讨论，包括我和你，你知道，最近把番茄生菜放到区块链上，我们把，你知道，名牌包放到区块链上，也许会发生，但嗯，是的，有很多讨论，但行动不多。所以，是的，我个人，我非常努力地不给东西贴上品牌，说它是下一个大事件。我只是想提供人们使用的产品，而且我认为最好的流行语是自然产生的，因为消费者实际上在称呼事物，事物是自然产生的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you should make fun of those people a little bit because people have been talking a lot about this stuff for many many years. There's been a lot of talk including from me and you know more recently put tomato lettuce on the blockchain putt we're going to put you know fancy I still fancy purses on the blockchain which maybe it'll do it'll happen but um yeah there's been a lot of talk and not much action. So yeah me personally uh I try very hard not to brand stuff and say it's the next big thing. I I just want to make products available that people use and and I think the best buzzwords come out organically because consumers are actually calling things and and the things arise naturally, right?</p>
</details>

我认为有一个持续的笑话，但我会少嘲笑他了。我真的会。是的，大规模采用还有一年时间。它总是还有一年时间。机构资金也总是还有一年时间。但它似乎正在发生。但，是的，我认为我们终于站在了加密技术不再仅仅是比特币和**Meme币**（Memecoins: 基于互联网模因或玩笑而创建的加密货币），而是真正应用于现实世界中有用事物的悬崖边上。

<p class="english-text">And I think that there's a running gag that I'm going to make fun of him less though. I really am. Yeah, mass adoption is is a year away. It's always kind of been a year away. Institutional money is always a year away, too. But it seems like it's happening. But uh yeah, I I think that we're we're finally at the precipice of crypto technology not being just Bitcoin and memecoins and actually being applied to things that are useful in the real world.</p>
</details>

我有点相信了。我拭目以待。但是如果你有代币化股票，至少在美国，它实际上属于哪种**监管制度**（Regulatory Regime: 管理特定行业或活动的规则和法律体系）？它是一种证券还是一种衍生品，还是其他什么？你如何应对这方面的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm kind of convinced. I will believe it when I see it. Um but if you have tokenized stocks, what what regulatory regime does that actually fall under in the US at least? Like is that a security or is that a derivative or is that something else? And how are you navigating that aspect of it?</p>
</details>

嗯，所以它们在美国还不允许。但我们认为，在理想世界中，它们不应被视为**衍生品**（Derivative: 一种金融合约，其价值来源于标的资产）。它们应该被视为**证券**（Security: 一种可交易的金融资产），与传统股票同等对待。所以基本上，**SEC**（U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会）可以为个股颁布的所有保护措施和结构，也应该适用于股票代币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so they're not they're not uh permissible in the US yet, but our belief is that in the ideal world, they would not be treated as a derivative. Okay? They would instead be treated as a security kind of par pasu uh traditional stocks. So basically all of the protections, all of the structure that the SEC can kind of promulgate to individual stocks should pass through to stock tokens as well.</p>
</details>

我们认为这实际上不需要新的立法。SEC基本上可以制定规则。他们可以进行**规则制定**（Rulemaking: 政府机构制定、修改或废除法规的过程）。他们甚至可以在规则制定之前提供豁免，就像他们几十年前为**Reg A ATS**（Regulation A Alternative Trading System: 美国证券交易委员会的一项规定，允许小型公司通过简化程序向公众筹集资金）所做的那样。所以我们一直在与他们合作，我认为SEC的**Hester Peirce**（海丝特·皮尔斯：美国证券交易委员会委员，以其对加密货币的开明态度而闻名）和加密货币特别工作组的人员，你知道，我们一直在进行很多轮讨论，包括代币化，我认为他们非常渴望促成此事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and our belief is actually that this doesn't require new legislation. The SEC can basically make the rules. They can do rulemaking. They can even do relief in advance of of rulem like they did for reggga ATS if you guys are familiar a few decades ago. M so we we've been working with them and I think actually the folks at the SEC Hester and the crypto task force you know we've been engaging in a lot of roundts including tokenization I think they're pretty keen to make this happen.</p>
</details>

我实际上认为**欧盟**（EU: 欧洲联盟）的推出，以及展示这些代币的实用性，它运作良好，客户喜欢它，它在幕后极大地提高了效率和基础设施，使他们关心的各种事情变得更容易。我希望这能帮助刺激全球范围内的创新、活动和接受度，而不仅仅是在欧洲。政府的更迭对你来说一定影响巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I actually think the EU launch and and showing that you know these tokens are useful it works well customers love it it's a huge efficiency improvement and infrastructure improvement behind the scenes that makes all kinds of things that they care about easier. My my hope is that that'll help kind of spur innovation and and spur activity and acceptance worldwide, not just in Europe. The changing administration must be must have been huge for you.</p>
</details>

是的，这绝对是一个积极因素，因为，你知道，可能在2020年到2024年的大部分时间里，我们不得不采取防守姿态。我们的业务受到了多方面的攻击，我认为起初，当政府更迭时，这不再是一个主要因素，这本身就是巨大的解脱。仅仅是不再有**执法式监管**（Regulation by Enforcement: 监管机构通过执法行动而非明确规则来设定行业标准），不再需要投入大量的精力和资源来保护我们的业务免受这种冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it was definitely a positive because um you know pro probably over the much of the past much of the period of 2020 to 2024 we had to play defense. our business was under assault from multiple angles and I think at first when the administration changed having that not be a huge factor was a huge relief. Just just not having regulation by enforcement and not having to like spend a significant amount of mind share and resources on defending our business from from this onslaught.</p>
</details>

然后，这种情况转变为，好吧，我们必须锻炼一个我们以前从未真正锻炼过的肌肉，那就是现在有一种开放性，可以制定新规则，并真正向前推进，鼓励创新。那会是什么样子？与一个希望积极主动、让美国成为领导者的政府合作会是什么样子？我认为这非常受欢迎。是的，我认为你看到了**稳定币法案**（Stablecoin Bill: 指美国国会正在讨论的稳定币监管立法），你也会看到**市场结构**（Market Structure: 金融市场运作的组织方式和规则）方面的变化，我认为我们将能够执行这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then that shifted into, okay, well, we we've got to exercise a muscle that we haven't really had to exercise before, which is there's an openness to create new rules and to like actually move forward and and encourage innovation. What does that look like? What does it look like to actually work with an administration that wants to get on the front foot and make the US the leader? And I I think that's been very welcome. Yeah, I think you saw with the stable coin bill, you'll see with market structure that uh I think we'll be able to execute on this.</p>
</details>

与他们合作是什么感觉？请给我们一些关于本届政府与上届政府实际流程的细节。他们行动迅速，这非常惊人。我的意思是，**Bo Hines**和**David Sacks**非常关心这个问题。他们非常关心我们不仅在加密货币领域，而且在人工智能领域都能成为第一。他们一直在与行业互动，而且他们对官僚主义过敏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's it been like working with them? Just give us some color of like the actual process in this administration versus the last one.

They've been engaging industry and they're also like allergic to bureaucracy.</p>
</details>

我认为在上一届政府中，坦率地说，很难获得一次会议，对吧？首先，我不知道人们有多久没有去办公室了，但那都是远程会议。远程完成这些事情很难。你是否认为这在实质上有所不同？因为我认为远程解决涉及多个利益相关者的复杂问题确实很难。所以即使是像举行一次圆桌会议这样简单的事情，在上一届政府中也无法真正完成，因为他们都是虚拟聊天，每个人都在远程工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think in the in the previous administration, frankly, it was it was hard to get a meeting, right? Uh first of all, I I don't know for how long people weren't going into offices, but like it was remote meetings. It's hard to get this stuff done remotely. to you made a substantive difference in terms that that made a substantive difference because I think it's really hard to solve complex problems with multiple stakeholders remotely. So even just something as simple as like having a roundt wasn't really done couldn't couldn't really be done in the previous administration because they were all it was all just virtual chats everyone was working remotely.</p>
</details>

### 监管环境与加密货币的未来

我还有另一个与加密货币相关的问题。我有时会想，谁在加密货币中赚钱？我的意思是，曾经有一段时间，人们对特定的**L1s**（Layer 1: 指区块链网络的基础层，如以太坊、Solana）非常兴奋，比如以太坊与**Solana**（Solana: 一个高性能的区块链平台）等等，但我不清楚他们是否会收取大量的费用，尤其是在你使用第二层的情况下，我不知道你会构建多少价值，然后你将构建一个第二层，我不知道最终有多少价值会流向以太坊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have another crypto related question. I I some one of the things I wonder about is who makes money in crypto and by that I mean like at one point there was a lot of excitement about the specific L1s right so Ethereum versus Salana etc but it's not clear to me that they're going to like collect tons of fees especially you know it's like you're using a layer 2 I don't know how much value or you're build and then you're going to build a layer two I don't know how much value actually then occurs to uh say Ethereum.</p>
</details>

**Circle**（Circle: 一家全球金融科技公司，USDC稳定币的发行方）最近上市，表现非常好，这项业务看起来非常棒。另一方面，他们将大部分资金支付给**Coinbase**（Coinbase: 一家美国加密货币交易所）用于分销等。所以，我真的不知道他们是否会在很长一段时间内赚很多钱。也许会是分销。顺便问一下，你们会参与其中吗？比如，Circle会在某个时候，你们会从稳定币发行方那里向在你们平台上持有该币的客户收取费用吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Circle recently came public doing incredibly Well, that business is seems like it's insanely good. On the other hand, they pay a lot of their money to Coinbase for uh distribution, etc. So, I don't really know if they're going to like make a ton of money in the long time. Maybe it'll be the distribution. Are you going to, by the way, are you going to get in on that? Like, will Circle like at some point will you be collecting money from the stable coin issuers to the customers who hold that coin on your platform?</p>
</details>

嗯，我们去年宣布加入了**Dollar Global Network**（Dollar Global Network: 一个由多家公司组成的联盟，旨在创建一种新的全球稳定币），这是一个由**Paxos**、**Kraken**和其他一些公司组成的联盟，旨在创建一个具有全球性质的新稳定币，并将向持有者支付非常有竞争力的利息。所以，目标实际上是将大部分经济效益以利息的形式支付给客户。因为如果你想想，如果你持有**USDC**或大多数其他稳定币，比如**Tether**，你没有获得利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we we announced last year that we joined the dollar global network, which is a consortium with Paxos, Kraken, a bunch of other uh companies to create a new stable coin that's going to be global in nature and we'll pay very competitive interest to holders. So, the goal would actually be to take much of those economics and pay them in the form of interest to customers. Because if you think about it, if you're if you're holding, you know, USDC or most or tether, most other stable coins, uh you're not getting interest.</p>
</details>

Coinbase用户间接获得利息，对吧？如果他们在Coinbase上持有USDC，Circle将资金汇给Coinbase，然后Coinbase将资金汇给用户，他们确实获得了奖励。这是真的，但我认为这与利息有点不同。而且我认为它也不是普遍的。我的意思是，你必须以托管方式持有它。你不能只是在链上持有。而且如果你使用Tether或其他稳定币，你肯定不会获得利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is Coinbase users are getting interest indirectly though, right? If they hold USDC on Coinbase and Circle remits money to Coinbase and then Coinbase remits money to the user, they are they are getting rewards. Uh which is which is true, but I think it's a little bit different than interest. And I think it's also not universal. I mean, you have to be holding it custodially. You can't be just like holding it on chain. And uh you're certainly not getting it if you're using Tether or or one of these others.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，我认为他们可以获得奖励和激励，但我认为随着时间的推移，他们也必须获得利息，因为如果你没有获得利息，你真的没有动力以稳定币的形式持有美元。激励只会是……对。立即转换并存入银行，我认为大多数加密货币人士会告诉你，这有点违背了使用加密货币的全部意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yeah, I think I think they can get rewards and incentives, but uh I think over time they'll have to they'll have to get interest as well because if you're not getting interest, you don't really have an incentive to hold US dollars in the form of stable coin. The incentive would just be Yeah. Right. convert it immediately and put it in a bank, which I think most crypto people would tell you it it kind of defeats the whole point of uh of using crypto.</p>
</details>

我认为在国际上没问题，因为那些人只是想要一个便利服务。是的。所以你可以摆脱……我认为目前这是一个足够好的价值主张。但我认为随着时间的推移，当利息被解锁时，最好的稳定币，最终获得市场份额的那些，将支付非常有竞争力的利率。所以这将成为竞争的一个轴心，最终用户将受益。所以，实际上，直接说吧，我不确定那是否是一个长期可持续的大规模收入来源。我认为它会被竞争掉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think internationally it's okay because those people just want you get a convenience service. Yeah. So you can you can get rid of uh I think it's a good enough value proposition for now. But I think over time as the interest is unlocked um the the best stable coins will will actually the ones that ultimately gain market share are going to pay a very competitive interest rate. So that's going to become an axis for for competition and the end user will benefit. So, so actually to uh to cut to the chase, I'm not sure that's a long-term sustainable large revenue stream. I think it'll get competed away.</p>
</details>

也许没有人会在加密货币中赚钱，而这将是消费者的福利。嗯，好吧，这正是我要问的问题。好的，谁在这里赚钱？当我想到资本市场时，如果我是一个老派的投资者或老派的经济学家，思考资本市场，我会想，好吧，投资者来了，他们给公司钱，他们获得股权作为回报，公司用这笔钱去扩张业务，最终他们偿还投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe no one will make money in crypto and it'll be the benefit of the consumer. I Well, okay, this is exactly the question I wanted to ask. Okay, so who makes money here? When I think about capital markets, like if I'm an old school investor or an old school economist thinking about capital markets, I think like, okay, well, an investor comes along and they give a company money uh and they get equity in return and the company uses that money to go out and expand their business and eventually they pay back the investor.</p>
</details>

然后我看看现在的投资，我相信你以前听过这种批评，但其中很多看起来都极其合成。你知道，代币建立在代币之上，再建立在代币之上。我想我的问题是，对你来说，**资本市场**（Capital Markets: 促进长期资金借贷和投资的市场）和这种交易的实际目的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I look at investing nowadays, I'm sure you've heard this criticism before, but so much of it seems extremely synthetic. you know, tokens built on top of tokens on top of tokens. I guess my question is like to you, what is the actual purpose of capital markets and this type of trading?</p>
</details>

我确实认为资本形成有一个有价值的目的。我认为它有点失落了，或者我会说美国的散户投资者已经与这个目的脱节了，因为现在没有太多公司上市。我认为过去几个月是一个例外。但如果你放眼全局，你知道，回到80年代或70年代末，你可以在IPO时以相当低的估值进入一家上市公司，并获得千倍或万倍的回报。我的意思是，如果你在IPO时投资了**微软**（Microsoft: 一家跨国科技公司）或**苹果**（Apple: 一家跨国科技公司），你还有很大的上涨空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think that there's a valuable purpose of of capital formation. I think it's gotten a little bit lost uh or or I'd say the retail investor in the US has gotten disconnected from that purpose because not too many companies are going public nowadays. I think past few months have been an exception locally. But if you look out broadly, you know, back in the 80s or late '7s, you used to be able to get into a public company at IPO at a pretty low valuation and kind of get a thousandx or 10,000x return. I mean, if you'd invested in Microsoft or Apple at IPO, you you had a lot of upside left.</p>
</details>

所以公司过去会更早上市。现在，你知道，你有**SpaceX**、**OpenAI**（OpenAI: 一家人工智能研究和部署公司），这些公司价值数千亿美元，却仍然保持私有，这些收益流向了越来越少富有的内部人士。我认为这是这项技术的另一个潜力，因为，你知道，正如我提到的，我们作为“捕捉代币”活动的一部分，向消费者发布了SpaceX代币。随着时间的推移，这将带来24/7的私人股票流动市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, companies used to go public earlier. Nowadays, you know, you've got SpaceX, Open AI, companies that are worth hundreds of hundreds of billions of dollars still staying private and those gains are acrewing to a smaller and smaller set of wealthy insiders. And I think that's another potential for the technology because, you know, as as I mentioned, we release SpaceX tokens to consumers as part of this um as part of our to catch a token event. And what that will do over time is you'll have 24/7 liquid markets and private stocks as well.</p>
</details>

而且，我认为那将非常令人兴奋。在美国，如果这些是允许的，我认为这需要加密货币方面的东西，还需要放宽**合格投资者**（Accredited Investor: 符合特定收入或净资产标准的投资者，可以投资某些非公开证券）标准，我认为事情会变得非常有趣。是的。因为那样你就能以更大的规模解锁资本形成，并且让散户参与到一些伟大的机会中，比如如果你是散户，你想获得人工智能热潮的敞口，你在美国的选项非常有限，我实际上认为这是一个巨大的问题，因为人工智能热潮对普通人来说非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh I I think that's going to be very exciting. And in in the US, if those are permissible, which I think requires the crypto stuff, but also a relaxation of the accreditation standards, I think things start to get really interesting. Yeah. because then you you unlock capital formation at a greater scale and also uh participation for retail in uh some of these great opportunities like if you're retail and you want to gain exposure to the AI boom your options in the US are extremely limited and I actually think that's a huge problem because the AI boom is very very consequential to everyday people.</p>
</details>

伙计，我也在看Circle的**IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股），这太疯狂了，它每天上涨20%。我有一个关于IPO的问题。我很想听听你的看法。每次有IPO上涨，你都会听到有人说，这其实很糟糕，他们把很多钱留在了桌上。实际上几十年来一直有替代的IPO途径，90年代末**Google**（谷歌：一家跨国科技公司）在上市时就曾著名地采用了**荷兰式拍卖**（Dutch Auction: 一种IPO定价方式，所有中标者以最低中标价购买股票）等方式。然而，IPO这种形式却一直存在。你对此有什么理论吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">man the cir I'm also looking at the circle IPO this thing is insane it goes up like 20% % a day. I have a question about IPOs. I'd love to get your take on this. Um, every time there's an IPO that goes up, you have like the sort of like N is like actually this was bad and they left all this money on the table. There have been alternative routes to IPOing for decades actually late 90s Google famously did a Dutch auction when it became public etc. Yet the IPO as a thing persists.</p>
</details>

比如，为什么IPO模式，即大银行、传统大银行获得配额，他们的最佳客户获得巨大的收益等等，而公司却把钱留在了桌上，为什么在你看来它能持续这么久？这说明了市场什么？这是在拐弯抹角地问Robinhood为什么选择IPO吗？不，我的意思是，是的，也许吧，但传统IPO有什么特别之处，让它如此**林迪**（Lindy: 指非易逝品，其未来预期寿命与当前寿命成正比）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you have a theory for why? Like why is it that like the IPO model where the big bank the big legacy banks they get their allocation and their best clients get this big bump etc and the company leaves money on the table. Why does it persist for so long in your view? What does it say about market? Is this a roundabout way of asking why Robin Hood IPOed? No, I mean yeah sure maybe but like what is it about the traditional IPO that's so lindy?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为这只是被监管所固化了。不，不是。Google做了荷兰式拍卖。显然还有其他方式。**SPACs**（特殊目的收购公司）已经存在，它们已经回来了。然而，优秀的公司仍然基本上通过IPO途径上市。是的，这是个好问题。我想说那些都是人们尝试过的IPO的各种变体。你也有**直接上市**（Direct Listings: 公司直接在证券交易所挂牌交易，不通过承销商发行新股）的方式。是的。直接上市的缺点当然是你无法募集一级资本，我认为这对很多公司来说很有用，他们确实将其视为一次融资事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh well I think it's just uh enshrined in regulatory. No, it's not. The Google did a Dutch auction. There clearly other ways to go. Spaxs existed for they're coming back already. And yet and yet good companies continue to basically go by the IPO route. Yeah, that's a good question. I I would say those are all kind of variants of the IPO that people have experimented with. You have direct listings as well. Yeah. Downside of course with the direct listing is you can't raise primary capital which I think is is useful to a lot of companies like they do look at it as a financing event.</p>
</details>

是的。所以，我认为在IPO的沙盒中会有一些迭代和实验，就像我们所看到的。但我想你看看私人公司的代币化。如果我们沿着这条线索深入探讨，那也为公司提供了一个有趣的替代方案，既可以募集一级资本，也可以为股东利用二级市场流动性。我认为目前还不清楚这对资本市场会产生怎样的长期影响，但它肯定会到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So uh I I think there will be some iteration and some experimentation within the IPO sandbox like we've seen. But I think you you look at tokenization of private companies. If we kind of pull on that thread, that that presents an interesting alternative to to companies as well, both for raising primary capital and for tapping into secondary liquidity for shareholders. I think it's not yet clear what the impact of that will be long-term to capital markets, but it's definitely coming.</p>
</details>

所以你提到了美国**合格投资者**的限制规定，我从来没有真正决定过我对它们的看法，因为，你知道，一方面，它们旨在保护不明真相的散户投资者。另一方面，它们似乎确实将人们排除在市场上的许多机会之外。你从Robinhood这样的公司听到的一件事是**金融民主化**（Democratizing Finance: 使金融服务和投资机会更广泛地向大众开放）这个概念。这正是流行语和口号，我们将带来所有这些机会……

不，他们也曾用**E*Trade**（亿创理财）谈论过这个。我，我，我在99年是日内交易员。还有**P2P借贷**（Peer-to-peer Lending: 个人对个人借贷，通过在线平台直接进行）。他们都对此非常热衷。好的。但就此而言，好吧。我们让你……他们从我们这里学来的。好的。好的。好的。但就此而言，金融民主化有没有限度？或者你认为在投资者准入方面应该有任何防护措施吗？

But on this note, like is there a limit to how far you can democratize finance or do you believe there should be like any guard rails in terms of investor access?</p>

“任何”是一个很大的词。我的意思是，显然我能想到一些例子，有些事情可能不应该被民主化，或者至少不应该首先被民主化。比如，我不知道散户是否需要交易**抵押债务凭证**（Collateralized Debt Obligations: CDO，一种复杂的结构性金融产品）或一些这类高度机构化的产品，但，嗯，我认为对于私人公司来说，讨论起来会容易一些。我认为很难想象一个论点能说明为什么散户不应该获得访问权限。

<p class="english-text">I think any is a big term. I mean obviously I can think of some examples of things that maybe shouldn't be uh democratized or at least democratized first. like I I don't know if retail needs to be trading collateralized debt obligations or some of these heavily institutional products, but um I I think with private companies, it's a little bit of an easier discussion. Um I think that it's hard to imagine an argument for why retail should not have access to that.</p>

比如，一个表面上不合逻辑的论点。我的意思是，你可以接触到这么多东西。你可以在亚马逊上花钱购买各种小玩意，它们会立即贬值。你可以购买Meme币，对吧？所以，认为那些花钱的方式没问题，但购买OpenAI或SpaceX股票却不行，我认为这表面上是不合逻辑的。要么我们必须禁止人们做很多其他浪费钱的事情。我的问题是，我认为在一个万物皆可得的世界里，你会诱导很多人去寻找欺诈的方式，而小玩意就是小玩意。

<p class="english-text">Like the the an argument that on its face isn't illogical. I mean, you have access to so many things. You can just spend your money on Amazon and buy all sorts of trinkets that immediately lose value and depreciate. You can buy meme coins, right? So, the idea that those classes of ways to spend your money are okay, but buying open AI or SpaceX stock, I think I think on its face, it's illogical. either we have to ban a whole bunch of other things that people do to blow their money should be. Uh my issue is that I think in a world where everything is available, you induce a lot of people to essentially find ways to fraud to create fraud whereas a trinket is a trinket.</p>

总之，我想我们必须让你走了。我们可以聊很长时间。未来一切都会上链吗？我不知道是不是所有东西。好的。但我认为任何人们想要交易、买卖并获得流动性的东西，很可能会找到上链的方式。好的，弗拉德·特内夫，非常感谢你来到OddLots。聊得很愉快。谢谢你们。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">Anyway, I think uh we have to let you go. We could talk for uh a really long time. Will everything be on chain in the future? I don't know about everything. Okay. But I think anything that people want to trade, buy or sell, and and get liquidity on, uh, will likely find its way on chain. All right, Blood Tennov, thank you so much for, uh, coming on Oddlash. That was a blast. Thank you guys. Thank you.</p>

### 区块链技术的演变与效率提升

特蕾西，我真的不敢相信区块链的程度，我的意思是，他没有说区块链，但所有这些公司都有自己的链。所以像Coinbase有自己的链叫做**Base**（Base: Coinbase开发的以太坊第二层区块链），Robinhood也有自己的链。我以为七八年前这个想法很荒谬，而且有点不同，他们没有把番茄放到链上，但链本身，其中币不那么重要。它以一种我意想不到的方式发展起来。

<p class="english-text">Tracy, I really can't believe the degree to which like a blockchain I mean he didn't say blockchain, but it's every all these companies have their own chain. So like Coinbase has its own chain called base, Robin Hood with its own chain. Like I thought that was so ridiculous the idea like seven or eight years ago and and it's a little different like they're not putting tomatoes on chain but like the change themselves that where the coin is not that important. It sort of took off in a way that I wouldn't have guessed.</p>
</details>

我的问题是，如果你现在是一个不交易加密货币的人，是的，你的日常生活中有什么东西正在链上交易、存在或被追踪吗？我真的不这么认为。不，我不这么认为。所以，但它确实……所以我们仍然处于观望模式。人们仍然在谈论它。是的，我想我接受链技术会改变事物并使其变得不同的想法，但我想，为什么它还没有发生呢？其次，听起来障碍仍然不一定是技术。我们有可以让你做到这些的技术，但它仍然是监管问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Here's my question. If you're a person right now who is not trading crypto, yeah, is there anything in your day-today life that is, you know, trading or existing or being tracked onchain? I don't really think so. No, I don't think so. So, but it does but So, we're still we're still in the wait and see mode. People are still talking about it. And yeah, I guess like I'm I'm open to the idea that chain technology is going to change things and and make things different, but I guess like why hasn't it happened already? And then B, it sounds still like the barrier isn't necessarily technology. Like we have things that would allow you to do this, but it's still regulatory.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，听起来它没有发生的原因是**拜登政府**（Biden Administration: 指美国总统乔·拜登领导的政府）的所有人都在家工作，他们无法举行圆桌会议。不，听起来这可能确实是其中一部分。监管环境的变化，以及美国**民主党**（Democratic Party: 美国两大主要政党之一）对加密货币的深度怀疑，无论好坏，似乎都非常真实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it sounds like the reason it didn't happen is because all the Biden administration people were working from home and they could they didn't have round table. No, it does sound like probably that is part of it. the sort of changing regulatory environment and the deep suspicion towards crypto for better or worse uh on the part of the Democratic party in the US like obviously seems pretty real and I do think it's seems like that between the Genius Act moving forward in Congress and obviously the changing of the guard at the SEC there is a real movement and to my mind it's not really like and again I always sort of go back um and think about our episodes with Austin Campbell to my It's not like okay like there is some benefit to me right now in the existence of chains but the idea that like legacy software for reasons that we all know is never going to get its act together to have something like 247 trading for better or worse I don't even know if 247 is trading but some people want to do it because some people want to trade at 3 p.m. in the afternoon and it sounds like uh or what I suspect and I think is probably like real or imminent is that through change that that will uh that that will be something that becomes fairly common.</p>
</details>

我确实认为，在国会推进的《天才法案》（Genius Act）和SEC领导层更迭之间，确实存在一场真正的运动，在我看来，这并不是说，好吧，链的存在现在对我有什么好处，而是传统软件出于我们都知道的原因，永远无法实现24/7交易，无论好坏，我甚至不知道24/7是否是交易，但有些人想这样做，因为有些人想在下午3点交易，听起来，或者我怀疑并且认为可能是真实或即将发生的是，通过改变，这将成为相当普遍的事情。

<p class="english-text">I guess here's where I'm coming from. It seems to me that a lot of this is incremental rather than revolutionary. And when people were first talking about it, it was very much in those revolutionary terms. And now it just seems like, you know, like an impiency improvement. I I totally agree with that. I mean, one thing this is definitely not is some sort of like cipher punk vision where people are trading everything without the government being able to look at it.</p>
</details>

我想这就是我的观点。在我看来，这很多都是渐进式的，而不是革命性的。当人们最初谈论它时，它非常具有革命性色彩。而现在，它似乎只是一种效率的提升。我完全同意这一点。我的意思是，这绝对不是某种**赛博朋克**（Cipherpunk: 密码朋克，主张通过强加密技术保护个人隐私和自由）的愿景，即人们在政府无法监管的情况下交易一切。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That is definitely true. But, you know, like the efficiency improvement is actually it's not nothing. Like, don't get me wrong, it's not only not nothing. It's not nothing. It's actually kind of a surprise to me because the the um the way people talked about, you know, the thing with blockchains is that they're decentralized and costly. And you brought up the point of Ethereum gas fees, but if everyone can have these sort of basically low fee layer twos because they're more they're in large part centrally run, you sort of solve some of the compute issues because you're not you don't have to like uh coordinate all these different nodes around the world. It's the Robin Hood chain. It's the Coinbase chain. It's whatever.</p>
</details>

这绝对是真的。但是，你知道，效率的提升实际上并非微不足道。我的意思是，别误会，它不仅不是微不足道。它并非微不足道。这对我来说实际上有点惊讶，因为人们过去谈论区块链的方式是，它们是**去中心化**（Decentralized: 不受单一中心机构控制）且昂贵的。你提到了以太坊的Gas费问题，但如果每个人都能拥有这些基本上低费用的第二层，因为它们在很大程度上是集中运行的，你就能解决一些计算问题，因为你不需要协调世界各地所有这些不同的节点。它是Robinhood链。它是Coinbase链。它是任何东西。

<p class="english-text">Maybe it is more efficient than legacy infrastructure that has been updated and cobbled together for like literally decades and will be here decades from now. It's certainly true that you don't hear the gas fee complaints the way you used to, right? Like some of that's been solved. All right. Well, should we leave it there? Yeah, let's leave it there.</p>
</details>

它可能比几十年来一直在更新和拼凑起来的传统基础设施更高效，并且未来几十年仍将存在。确实，你不再像以前那样听到Gas费的抱怨了，对吧？其中一些问题已经解决了。好吧。那么，我们就在这里结束吧？是的，就在这里结束。
