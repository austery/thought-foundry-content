title: 衰老科学的迷思与真相：量化、干预及健康寿命的追求
summary: 本访谈深入探讨了衰老科学的核心议题，揭示了生物学年龄与表观遗传时钟如何超越传统时间概念，成为衡量和干预衰老过程的关键指标。讲者强调，衰老并非疾病本身，而是多种疾病的根本驱动因素，通过生活方式干预和前沿细胞重编程技术，我们有望减缓甚至逆转细胞层面的衰老，从而延长健康寿命，而非仅仅追求长寿。文章还探讨了营养、热量限制及间歇性禁食对延缓衰老的潜在益处，并呼吁关注健康公平性。

### 衰老科学：量化与干预的起点

我对衰老科学的兴趣源于童年时期，我的父亲在我出生时已年过五十，这让我很早就开始思考衰老过程。当同龄孩子还在无忧无虑时，我已开始关注父母的疾病风险和寿命。进入大学后，我发现了一个致力于理解并可能干预衰老过程的完整科学领域，这促使我投身于衰老科学研究。我目前的研究重点是量化或测量衰老，即通过分析人体细胞和分子层面的变化，来评估个体衰老的速度。我们每个人都会衰老，但衰老的速度却不尽相同。我的实验室致力于为这种衰老速度赋予一个具体的数值，以衡量一个人衰老得快或慢。我们认为这至关重要，因为它可能预示着未来的疾病风险、剩余寿命以及我们普遍关心的健康状况。

许多人并未意识到自己对衰老过程拥有多大的掌控力。他们常认为寿命或罹患癌症、心脏病等疾病的风险是由基因决定的，是不可避免的。然而，我们实际上有能力调节潜在的风险，或者至少是这些疾病发生的时间。通过帮助人们理解衰老过程、其生物学机制以及这些机制对疾病的重要性，我们相信这将促使人们采取有效措施，减缓衰老速度，并延长我们的**健康寿命**（Health Span: 指个体在健康、无疾病状态下生活的年限），即无疾病的预期寿命。

I study the science of aging, and my book is called "True Age." My interest in the science of aging probably started when I was quite young because my father was fairly old when I was born. He was in his mid 50s, and so I became really aware of the aging process from a young age. So at a time when maybe most kids weren't contemplating their parents' disease risk and mortality, it was something I was always inherently concerned about. And then when I actually went to college, I learned there was an entire scientific field focused on trying to understand the aging process and potentially even intervene in it. And this really drove me to work on the science of aging. So my current research really focuses on trying to actually quantify or measure aging. So can we take all of the cellular molecular changes that people have undergone and actually give them a sense of how they're doing in terms of the aging process? Are the aging slower than we would expect, or are they aging faster than we would expect? We all age, but we don't all age at the same rate. So my lab is really interested in can we actually put a number to that? Can we measure how fast or slow a given person might be aging? And we think this is really critical because it probably has implications for their risk of disease in the future, their remaining life expectancy and other things that we all care about in terms of our health. I think a lot of people don't realize how much power we actually have over our aging process. So a lot of people think, "Oh, my life expectancy or my risk of getting something like cancer or heart disease is due to genetics or it's just gonna happen." But we actually have a lot of ability to kind of modulate our potential risks, or at least the timing perhaps of when these diseases might occur. So by actually having people understand the aging process, the biology that goes into it and why that's important for disease, we think that this will actually help people take meaningful steps to slow the rate of aging and increase what we call their health span or their kind of time of life expectancy free from disease.

### 生物学年龄：超越时间刻度的生命真相

大多数人以**时间年龄**（Chronological Age: 从出生到现在的实际时间长度）来衡量年龄或衰老。我们都知道自己活了多少年，并以此来衡量衰老过程。我们非常重视这个数字，但实际上，这并非真正重要的数字。我们之所以如此执着于时间年龄，是因为它与我们所说的**生物学年龄**（Biological Age: 反映个体生理功能和细胞分子层面衰老程度的指标）过程紧密相关。随着时间的推移，包括人类在内的所有生命系统都会逐渐退化，功能减弱，这便是我们所说的生物学衰老过程。它反映了我们的细胞功能如何变差，身体如何随时间变化。

重要的是，与时间年龄不同，生物学年龄是**可塑的**（Malleable: 能够被改变或影响的）。我们可以从不同物种的比较中得知这一点：一个10岁的狗与一个10岁的人相比，它们的身体衰退速度明显不同。即使在人类中，两个时间年龄同为50岁的人，其整体健康状况和衰老速度也可能截然不同。因此，理解生物学衰老过程，了解我们个体随时间推移的差异，以及这可能对未来健康意味着什么，变得至关重要。

关于衰老是否普遍存在于所有生物体中，科学界存在争议。大多数科学家认为衰老是生命系统普遍存在的现象，生命系统会随着时间推移而固有地变化和衰退。然而，有些生物体的衰老速度极慢，达到**可忽略衰老**（Negligible Senescence: 衰老速度极慢，以至于在观察期内无法检测到衰老迹象）的程度，以至于我们无法观察到其衰老。为了衡量不同生物体的衰老速度，我们通常会观察它们的**生存曲线**（Survival Curves: 统计学工具，用于展示在特定时间段内，一个群体中存活个体比例的变化），即随着时间推移，群体死亡风险是否增加。

通常，当我们想到与老年相关的变化时，会想到功能性变化，例如跑步或走路的速度、爬楼梯的能力或精力水平，以及脸上的皱纹、头发变灰或脱落，以及某种程度上与衰老相关的疾病。但实际上，这些并非衰老的起点，而是衰老的**表现**（Manifestations: 某种现象或过程的可见结果）。我们认为衰老始于更低的层面，即**分子和细胞层面**（Molecular and Cellular Level: 构成生命体的最小结构和功能单位的层面）。如果我问一个人多大年纪，他们会立即回答上次生日吹了多少根蜡烛，或者驾照或护照上的年龄。但这个数字本身意义不大，除非它与我们真正关心的生物学衰老概念相关联。科学家所说的生物学年龄，是指在特定时间段内，你的生物学变化程度。我们认为这些变化是不适应性的，会导致更多功能障碍、衰退，并最终引发更多疾病。

在衰老科学中，能够量化或评估衰老过程至关重要，这正是我们探讨如何测量生物学年龄的起点。科学家们发现，量化或测量衰老过程有三大主要优势：
1.  **理解衰老科学**：深入了解系统衰老的生物学原因、驱动因素以及干预方法。
2.  **临床试验终点**：为旨在干预衰老过程的临床试验和科学研究提供一个评估成功与否的客观指标。
3.  **健康风险分层**：帮助人们了解自己的整体健康状况，并进行**风险分层**（Risk Stratification: 根据个体风险水平进行分类，以便采取针对性干预措施），从而识别哪些人更容易患上与年龄相关的疾病。在此基础上，人们可以与医生合作，或重新评估自己的生活方式和行为因素，以减缓衰老过程并实时监测。

测量生物学年龄的方法并非单一。你可以利用不同类型的数据。例如，有些人可能仅使用你的功能能力或已诊断疾病的数量作为衡量随时间变化的指标。另一个概念是**表型年龄**（Phenotypic Age: 基于生理指标（如血液检测结果）综合评估的生物学年龄），它主要衡量你在生理层面的变化。这些指标通常在你年度体检时通过验血获得，包括肝脏、肾脏等器官的功能、代谢健康、血脂，以及一定程度上的炎症和免疫状况。将这些指标综合起来，你可以得到一个整体的数值，或从整体表型层面了解你与同龄人相比的状况。它们能让我们了解不同器官系统如何协同运作，从而决定你的整体健康。此外，还有更具体的分子或细胞层面的测量方法，深入探究我们认为衰老过程可能真正开始的特定变量。我们认为这种衰老测量方法非常重要，因为它捕捉了我们认为先于疾病中出现的功能障碍的生理变化。因此，它能够预测未来的疾病风险，并且与疾病足够接近，能够告诉你当前的健康状况。

平均而言，我们预计大多数人的**表型年龄**每年会增加一岁，与**时间年龄**的增长同步。然而，理想情况下，我们希望看到表型年龄的增长速度慢于时间年龄，这被视为衰老过程的减速。开始测量表型年龄并没有所谓的“正确”或“错误”时机，我们常说“永远不嫌晚”。许多人认为自己已经太老，或者已经患病，可能不值得再测量。但我们发现，在整个生命周期中，个体的表型衰老过程仍然具有很大的可塑性。因此，我们认为任何年龄的人都应该监测这一指标。你可能在每年体检时已经获得了这些测量数据，只需将它们输入算法，就能获得一个医生传统上不会关注的额外变量。

通常，医生在查看你的实验室检查结果时，只会告诉你是否有任何生物标志物处于风险或异常范围。但这只提供了高风险和低风险的二元信息，而实际上，你的生理行为存在一个完整的谱系。即使你尚未达到高风险阈值，了解你是否接近或比同龄人更接近这个阈值，或者你接近它的速度有多快，都能提供大量额外信息，超越了传统的风险测量。由于表型年龄或其他生物学年龄测量方法的推导方式，普通人的生物学或表型年龄将与他们的时间年龄相同。如果你观察一个群体，会发现一个正态分布，大多数人的生物学或表型年龄与时间年龄相同。但我们也知道两边都有分布。例如，在美国人口中，这种标准差或个体差异约为五年。当然，也会有极端异常值，有些人看起来比实际年龄老10甚至20岁，或者年轻10到20岁，但大多数人会在时间年龄的±5年范围内。

如果你已经去看过医生并进行了年度血液检查，你很可能可以免费获得表型年龄测试。网上有免费的计算器，列出了计算表型年龄所需的九个生物标志物。你只需找到最近的实验室检查结果，输入数值，算法就会为你生成一个表型年龄。因此，如果你定期进行年度体检和实验室检查，你已经可以做到这一点。如果没有，你可以去看医生或前往提供这些血液检测的实验室，以相对较低的费用获得这些数据。随着时间的推移，你可以尝试改变自己的行为，并逐年观察这些改变是否反映在你的生物学年龄上。

衰老是大多数人担心的疾病（如心脏病、癌症和糖尿病）的最大风险因素。科学家认为，与其试图单独治疗每一种疾病，不如减缓人们的衰老速度，减缓我们不同器官和生理系统的衰退，这样我们就可以预防或至少减轻许多疾病的影响。因此，这不仅仅是延长人们的寿命，更是让他们尽可能长时间地保持健康和功能。

Most people think of age or aging in terms of chronological time. So we all know how many years we've been alive, and we usually measure our aging in terms of that time, so months, days, years since we were born. And we put a lot of emphasis and importance on this measure, but actually this isn't the number that counts. So the reason we've become so fixated on this idea of chronological age is because it's actually tied to what we consider this biological aging process. So over time, living systems like humans or any other organism, actually kind of degrade and become less functional over time. And we think of this as kind of the biological aging process. So how are our cells functioning worse than perhaps they were before, and how have our bodies kind of changed over time? And the important thing is that, unlike chronological time, this is something that's potentially malleable. So we know this from looking at different species. So you can compare a 10-year-old dog to a 10-year-old human and clearly the rate at which their bodies have declined over that time is quite different. And we even know among humans, you can look at two people who are, say, 50 years old chronologically, and clearly they may not look the same in terms of their overall health status and overall aging rate. So really it becomes important to understand the biological aging process, how far we've each kind of diverged over time and what this might mean for our future health. So there's actually a debate in the field whether aging is universal and if every organism actually ages. Most scientists actually think that aging is a universal thing among living systems, and living systems will inherently change over time and decline. But some of them actually do this at such a slow rate, what we call negligible senescence, that we actually can't observe aging in those systems. So usually to kind of tell how fast different organisms are aging, we look at their, what we call survival curves. So do you see an increased risk of mortality in a population as a function of time? And we think of that as kind of the overall rate at which that type of species or type of animal or plant is actually aging. So usually when we think of changes associated with old age, we think of functional changes, so things we can actually see in ourselves and in the people around us. So we think of changes even in things like how fast you can run or walk or your ability to go upstairs or just how much energy you have. And then we also think of these in terms of the wrinkles on our face, graying, or loss of hair, and also, to some degree, the diseases that we actually see manifest with aging. But in reality, these aren't where aging is actually starting. These are what we would call the emergence or the manifestations of aging. We really think aging is starting at a much lower level, so at the molecular and cellular level. So if I were to ask someone how old they were, their immediate response is going to be however many candles they blew out in their last birthday. It's the number on their driver's license or their passport. And really this number doesn't hold that much meaning except that it happens to be correlated with this concept of biological aging, which is actually what we really care about. And what scientists mean by biological age is really the degree to which your biology has changed over a given amount of time. And we think these changes are gonna be maladaptive, they're gonna lead to more dysfunction, more decline, and ultimately more disease. A really important thing in the science of aging is being able to actually quantify or estimate the aging process. So this is really where we get into this idea of can we measure biological age. There's three major advantages that scientists have found for trying to quantify or trying to measure the aging process. So the first one is just understanding the science of aging, understanding the biology of why systems age, what leads to this and how to intervene. The second is it provides an endpoint for any clinical trials or any science that is actually trying to intervene in this process to say whether they were actually successful at doing so. And then probably the third, which most people might care the most about, is it actually gives people an understanding of their overall health and is important for what we call risk stratification. So understanding who might be more at risk of developing these different age-related diseases, and from there actually either working with a physician or reassessing your lifestyle and behavioral factors to figure out if you can actually slow that process and monitor it in real time. And there isn't one right way to do this. And you can imagine you can use different types of data to do this. So some people might actually just use your functional abilities or the number of diseases that you've been diagnosed with as kind of an indices of how much you've changed over time. Another concept is this idea that we call phenotypic age, which really boils down to kind of how you're changing on a physiological level. These are things that you would go to your physician for your annual appointment and probably are already getting measured in a blood draw. So they're capturing things like functioning of different organs including our liver, kidney. They capture metabolic health, they capture lipids and to some degree they're also capturing things like our inflammation and immune profile. So when we put these all together, you can actually get an overall number or show on a holistic phenotypic level how you look compared to other people your age. They give us an idea of how your different organ systems are operating and kind of working together to give you your overall health. And then there are even more kind of specific ways you can do this on a molecular level or a cellular level where you're really diving into very specific types of variables that we think are where the aging process might actually be starting. And we think this measure of aging is really important because it captures the physiological changes that we actually think precede the dysfunction that we see arising in disease. So we actually think that it's predictive of future risk of disease, and it's also close enough or proximal enough to the disease that it's actually gonna be able to tell you how you're doing. So on average, we would expect most people would gain one year of phenotypic age for every one year of chronological age. So if you were to measure yourself every year on your birthday, we'd expect it to increase at one year every year. However, ideally what you would actually want to see is that your phenotypic age is increasing at a slower rate than your chronological age. And we would think of this as a deceleration or a slowing of the aging process. There's not really a right age or wrong age to start measuring your phenotypic age. So we also say it's never too late. So a lot of people think, "Well, I'm already too old, or I've already developed a disease, maybe it's not worth it to me." But we actually find that there's still a lot of malleability in terms of someone's phenotypic aging process throughout the entire lifespan. So we think that people of any age should actually be monitoring this, and you're probably already getting these measures when you go visit your doctor on an annual basis. So it's really easy to kind of put these into the algorithm and get one more variable beyond what your doctor's gonna look at. So typically when your doctor looks at your lab tests, they're gonna tell you if any of these biomarkers are in the kind of at risk or abnormal range. But that just gives you, we think of that as almost like there's high risk and low risk, but there's actually a whole spectrum of how your physiology is behaving. And there's a lot of information in knowing even if you haven't passed that high-risk threshold, are you close or are you closer to it than we would expect for your age, or how quickly are you approaching it? So this can give you additional information beyond these traditional risk measures that people look at. Because of the way phenotypic age or these other biological age measures were actually derived, the average person will have the same biological or phenotypic age as his or her chronological age. If you looked at a population, you'd expect to see a normal distribution where you find most people are predicted to be the same biological or phenotypic age as they are chronologically. But we know there's also spread on either side. And when we look at the average, for instance, United States population, we see that kind of that standard deviation or how much people kind of vary is around five years. Granted, you can get extreme outliers, so people who look 10 or maybe even 20 years older or younger than expected for their chronological age, but most people will fall in that kind of plus or minus five years of their chronological age. If you have already visited your doctor and you've got an annual blood test, you probably can get your phenotypic age test for free. So there are online calculators that list the nine biomarkers that you actually need to calculate your phenotypic age. These are freely available on the web. So all you would need to do is go and find your most recent lab tests, input the values and the algorithm will actually produce a phenotypic age measure for you. So assuming you are going and getting regular annual physicals with lab tests, this is something you can already do. And if not, you can visit your physician or something like a laboratory that offers a lot of these blood-based tests and get these for relatively little money. And over time you can actually try and modify your behaviors and see year to year if you're seeing that actually reflected in your biological age as you track it over time. Aging is the biggest risk factor for most of the diseases that people worry about, for things like heart disease and cancer and diabetes. And scientists actually think that rather than trying to treat each of those diseases individually, if we were to actually slow the rate at which people were aging and slow the decline in our different kind of organ and physiological systems, we could either prevent or perhaps lessen the impact of many of these diseases. So it's not just giving people a longer life, but it's keeping them healthy and functional for as long as possible.

### 表观遗传时钟：细胞层面的衰老密码

衰老研究领域的专家们提出了**衰老标志**（Hallmarks of Aging: 细胞和分子层面驱动衰老过程的九个核心特征）的概念。我的实验室特别关注其中一个标志：**表观遗传学**（Epigenetics: 研究基因表达可遗传性变化而不涉及DNA序列本身改变的学科）。如果说基因组是细胞的蓝图，那么表观遗传学就好比细胞的“操作系统”，它赋予每个细胞独特的特性和表型。尽管皮肤细胞和脑细胞拥有几乎完全相同的DNA，但正是**表观基因组**（Epigenome: 基因组上所有表观遗传修饰的总和）使它们功能和结构不同。表观基因组的研究已有数十年历史，但其复杂性使得我们才刚刚开始理解这些变化背后的深层含义。

表观基因组通常通过化学修饰来“书写”，其中在衰老研究中，尤其是量化衰老方面，研究最多的是**DNA甲基化**（DNA Methylation: 一种表观遗传修饰，通过在DNA分子上添加甲基基团来调控基因表达）。DNA甲基化是一种化学标签，添加到基因组特定区域（通常是C紧邻G的位置）。这种添加的重要性在于，它会关闭基因组的该部分，使其折叠起来，不再可访问。这是细胞识别哪些基因组区域可访问、哪些不可访问的方式，并且在不同细胞类型中有所不同。

我们还发现，这种表观遗传程序或DNA甲基化模式会随着衰老而发生显著重塑。即使皮肤细胞应具有特定的模式，但随着年龄增长，这种模式会变得紊乱。我们认为这导致了皮肤细胞的功能障碍，或者它们失去了其基本特性和执行特定任务的能力。我们体内每个细胞都有非常特定的功能，这些功能主要由表观基因组决定。问题在于，随着衰老，表观基因组会因压力或随机错误而重塑，导致每个细胞失去其身份，无法按最初设想的方式运作。随着越来越多的细胞功能失调，这最终会导致器官层面乃至整个系统层面的功能障碍。

科学家们发现，这些化学标签的模式会随着衰老发生显著变化，利用机器学习和人工智能技术，我们已经能够根据这些化学标签或DNA甲基化模式来预测一个人的表观年龄。这被称为**表观遗传时钟**（Epigenetic Clock: 基于DNA甲基化模式预测生物学年龄的算法模型），它通过衡量基因组特定区域甲基化的增加或减少来量化生物学年龄。我们认为，分子层面的这些变化正是导致表型或生理层面变化的原因。随着时间的推移，细胞功能会下降，越来越难以执行其最初的任务。这在许多疾病中都有体现，例如癌症。具有更快速表观遗传变化的细胞可能更容易癌变。我的实验室研究表明，肿瘤中的表观遗传时钟比正常组织显著加速。我们还发现，体内更容易患癌的器官，其细胞的表观遗传衰老速度似乎也更快。

许多人可能想知道如何测量自己的表观遗传年龄。目前市面上有一些直接面向消费者的产品可以提供这项服务。但由于它依赖更先进的技术来测量这些变化，因此比常规实验室检查昂贵得多。通常，使用这类产品测量表观遗传年龄需要血液或唾液样本。问题在于，这是否能很好地反映你的不同系统或器官的整体衰老情况，因为表观遗传年龄可以在不同的细胞类型和器官中测量。尽管如此，血液中测量的表观遗传时钟已被证明能很好地预测剩余寿命和疾病风险。随着时间的推移，这些算法将越来越擅长利用表观遗传测量来预测和捕捉整体衰老。

许多人对表观遗传时钟领域产生了兴趣，并开始长期监测自己的表观遗传年龄。就像**表型年龄**（Phenotypic Age: 基于生理指标（如血液检测结果）综合评估的生物学年龄）或其他生物学年龄指标一样，这能让人们追踪自己的整体衰老过程，并找出如何改变健康行为以优化这一过程。然而，对于个体层面（n=1）的表观遗传年龄追踪，我们尚不完全清楚表观遗传年龄的变化具体代表什么。如果你追踪它，改变生活方式，或增加新的养生方案，然后看到表观遗传年龄发生变化，目前尚不清楚是什么驱动了这种变化，或者它是否真正代表了衰老速度的变化；这与表型或生理指标不同，我们对这些指标的代表意义了解更多。

尽管如此，科学界对弄清这些表观遗传变化的驱动因素以及如何操纵和干预它们抱有浓厚兴趣，因为我们认为干预的最佳时机可能在分子层面，因为我们认为衰老始于分子层面。因此，理解表观遗传年龄变化的驱动因素及其功能意义至关重要。表观遗传时钟的一个令人兴奋之处在于，它们似乎与多种疾病相关。例如，它们与癌症有关，表观遗传年龄加速的细胞似乎更容易患癌。我们还在阿尔茨海默病、糖尿病，甚至某些肺部疾病中观察到这种情况。因此，令人惊叹的是，这个过程或现象并非疾病特异性的，而可能是一种普遍的疾病驱动因素。

对我而言，研究表观基因组和表观遗传时钟最令人兴奋的是，它是一个强大的工具，可以帮助我们理解细胞层面的变化，这些变化可能导致不同组织中多种疾病的发生。无论我们观察哪种细胞类型，都能看到相同的特征和现象。另一个令人兴奋之处是，这个过程似乎是我们可以干预的。我们知道它是双向的，并且有可能被逆转。

我担心人们持续监测和追踪自己的生物学年龄，会不可避免地将其用于**生物黑客**（Biohacking: 通过各种手段（如饮食、运动、补充剂、技术等）优化身体和精神表现的实践）。我认为我们可以在一定程度上这样做，但必须记住，这些测量方法都不是完美的。我们尚未完美地测量生物学年龄，而且你使用的测量方法可能会给出不同的答案。因此，我认为人们不应该过度优化某一个特定的生物学年龄指标。如果你知道自己正在做的事情对健康有益（例如饮食、运动、睡眠和压力管理），并且这些行为反映在你的生物学年龄上，那么你可以确信这可能是一个真实的结果。但令人担忧的是，人们可能会尝试大量疗法或补充剂，仅仅为了针对某一个数字，而这并非我们的目标。

最终，重要的是让人们认识到自己对衰老方式和疾病风险有多大的影响力。我们的疾病风险并非写在基因里。是的，我们可能都会衰老，而且我们无法完全阻止它，但衰老的速度以及你保持健康和最佳功能的时间长度，很大程度上取决于你日常生活中的所作所为。

People in the field have actually come up with what we might call hallmarks of aging. So one of these hallmarks that my lab in particular is very interested in is this concept of epigenetics. And epigenetics might not be a term that everyone's familiar with. We all know genetics, so our kind of sequence of DNA that gives rise to our different genes. But the epigenetics is really what I like to think of as the operating system of this cell. It's what gives each cell its different kind of defining characteristics in phenotype. So even though the cells in your skin and the cells in your brain have essentially the exact same DNA, what makes them different is the epigenome. So it gives them their overall function and structure. And the epigenome is actually something that has been studied in science for quite a few decades now, but the actual program or system itself is so complex that we're only just barely starting to understand the meaning of a lot of these changes that we see. So the epigenome is usually written in kind of chemical modifications. So there's different forms of these. And the one that's actually studied perhaps the most in aging, or at least in terms of trying to quantify aging, is this concept of DNA methylation. So basically what DNA methylation is is it's just a chemical tag that's added to specific parts of your genome. So you have the A, C, G and T, and DNA methylation is actually added when you have a C next to a G. And the importance of this is when it's added, it actually closes off that part of the genome. So the genome kind of folds in on itself and that part is no longer accessible. So this is how cells know which parts of the genome to access and not access, and this will be different for all the different cell types. The other thing though is that we know this epigenetic program or DNA methylation patterns are very remodeled with aging. So even though a skin cell should have a specific pattern, as people age, the pattern actually gets messed up. And we actually think that this is giving rise to dysfunction in the skin cell or their losing their essential identity, their ability to perform their specific task. Every cell in our body has a very specific function, and this function is really dictated by the epigenome. The problem is that with aging, the epigenome becomes remodeled either due to stress or random errors. And what this actually produces is that each cell is actually going to lose its identity and not function in the way it was initially intended. And over time, as more and more cells become dysfunctional, you can imagine how this would produce dysfunction at the organ level and eventually at the whole system level. One form of epigenetics is actually called DNA methylation, which is just a chemical modification to different places throughout the genome. So you have A C, G and T as the different nucleotides in our DNA, and when you have a C next to a G, they can have this chemical tag that can basically turn off regions of the genome. So scientists actually found that the pattern of these chemical tags is changed quite dramatically with aging, and using things like machine learning and AI, we've actually been able to predict how old someone appears based on these patterns of these chemical tags or DNA methylation. And this has been come to refer to as the epigenetic clock, which is basically just a way to try and quantify biological age based on either gains or losses in methylation at specific regions throughout the genome. And really we think that the changes at this level, this is what we would consider the molecular level, are what are giving rise to the changes we see at the phenotypic or physiological level. So over time, cells actually become less functional. They actually are less likely to represent what they were originally intended to do. And we see this in many diseases. So one instance might be cancer. So cells that actually have more rapid epigenetic changes may be prone to be more cancerous. And actually my lab has shown that when you measure things like an epigenetic clock, we actually see that it's highly accelerated in tumors compared to the normal tissue. We also see that the different organs in our body that are more prone to developing cancer seem to be aging epigenetically at a more rapid rate than cells that are maybe less prone to cancer. Many people might be wondering, "How do I actually get my epigenetic age measured or find out what the epigenetic clock says for me?" And right now there are some direct-to-consumer products that actually can provide this. This is a lot more expensive still than going and getting your regular lab tests because it relies on much more advanced technology to actually be able to measure all these changes. So typically if you were to use a direct-to-consumer product to measure your epigenetic age, you would do this through either a blood or saliva sample. And the question is whether that's actually a really good proxy for how your different systems or organs are aging overall. 'Cause again, your epigenetic age can be measured within different cell types and organs. That being said, the epigenetic clock measured in blood has been shown to be a good predictor of things like remaining life expectancy and disease risk. And over time these algorithms are gonna get better and better at predicting things and capturing aging overall using epigenetic measures. A number of people have become interested in the field of epigenetic clocks and started to actually monitor their epigenetic age over time. And just like measures like pheno age or other biological age indicators, this can give people a way to kind of track their overall aging process and figure out how they can change their health behaviors to try and optimize that. For people who wanna track epigenetic age on what we call an n equals one, so an individual level, we still don't know exactly what changes in epigenetic age represent. So if you were to track it, change something about your lifestyle, or you know add a new regiment and then see it a change in your epigenetic age, it's not clear what drove that or if that actually represents a change in your aging rate; verse kind of the phenotypic or physiological ones where we know a little bit more about what these markers represent. That being said, there's a lot of interest from the scientific community in actually figuring out what drives these epigenetic changes and how we can manipulate and intervene, because we actually think the point of intervention is gonna be better at this level since we think aging starts at a molecular level, so to understand what drives changes in epigenetic age and what that really represents functionally. The one exciting thing actually about epigenetic clocks is they actually seem relevant to a wide array of diseases. So they are implicated in things like cancer, so cells that seem to be more accelerated in terms of their epigenetic age seem to be more prone to cancer. But we also see it in other diseases like Alzheimer's disease or diabetes or even things like some of the lung diseases that you see. So really the amazing thing is that this process or this phenomenon is not disease specific and actually might be a unifying driver of diseases kind of across the board. The thing that's most exciting to me about studying the epigenome and the epigenetic clock is that this is actually a really powerful tool to understand some of the cellular changes that we think are potentially contributing to a wide array of diverse diseases across different tissues. So we see the same signature and same phenomenon regardless of the cell types we're looking at. And then the other really exciting thing is that this process, again, seems to be something we can intervene in. We know that it goes both ways and that it actually is something potentially amenable to being reversed. My one worry with people constantly monitoring and tracking their biological age is that people are going to inevitably want to use this for biohacking. And I think we can do this up to a certain extent, but we need to remember that none of these measures are perfect. We haven't perfectly measured biological age, and also the measure you use might give you different answers. So I think people shouldn't over-optimize to a specific biological age measure. And if you know that the things you're doing are good for health, so again, these common things like diet, exercise, sleep and stress and you're seeing that reflect in your biological age, I think you can be confident that that's probably a real result. But the one concern is that people will go and try a bunch of therapeutics or supplements just targeting this one number, and really that's not the goal here. In the end, it's really important for people just to realize how much power they actually have in terms of impacting the way in which they're gonna age and impacting the risk of disease. Our risks of disease are not written in our genes. Yes, we will probably all age, and we're not going to essentially stop that, but the rate at which that happens and the length of time that you can maintain health and optimal functioning really comes down to a lot of what you do in your everyday life.

### 衰老：疾病的驱动而非疾病本身

在衰老科学领域，关于衰老是否应被视为一种疾病并像其他疾病一样治疗，存在诸多争议。我个人认为，衰老本身并非一种疾病，但它是导致我们所关注的许多疾病的最主要过程。因此，我主张我们应该干预并尝试治疗，或者至少减缓衰老的速度，但不应将其视为一种疾病，因为没有一个明确的界限可以定义你衰老到何种程度才算患病。我们从出生到死亡都在不断衰老。最终重要的是，我们如何减缓这一过程，以预防许多人们正在试图治疗的疾病。

许多人认为衰老领域专注于**永生**（Immortality: 永不死亡的状态）或治愈死亡。我认为这与正在进行的大多数科学研究有些偏离。该领域真正关注的是如何预防衰老相关的疾病，并尽可能长时间地保持人们的健康。如果这最终能延长寿命，那只是一个额外的收获，但永生并非最终目标。我们的身体以非常特定的方式运作，这是进化的结果，但随着时间的推移，这种功能确实会下降。这正是我们所看到的疾病表现，疾病实际上是身体在某种过程中达到功能失调状态的体现。身体之所以达到这种状态，是因为我们认为随着衰老过程而累积的所有变化。当然，也可能存在感染或遗传易感性等其他因素导致疾病，但大多数疾病，如癌症、心血管疾病、阿尔茨海默病，都是我们各个系统功能逐渐丧失的表现，我们认为这直接由衰老过程驱动。因此，如果我们能弄清楚如何从内部减缓衰老速度，我们认为（科学也已证明）这很可能也会体现在我们的外部容貌上。

生命系统非常了不起。通过进化，我们形成了这种精妙的协调性和特异性，塑造了我们之所以为我们的样子。细胞有特定的作用，器官以特定的方式运作，这赋予了我们生命。然而，所有这些决定器官和细胞功能的因素都会随着时间而退化。我们认为，使细胞以特定方式运作的分子变化会随着衰老而“重写”。现在，细胞实际上失去了其特异性，变得更加功能失调。当你的组织和器官中累积了更多功能失调的细胞时，这些器官就无法按最初设想的方式运作。随着时间的推移，当你的器官开始功能失调时，你就会在整个身体层面看到这种影响。因此，我们开始看到我们更大的功能方面出现整体下降，例如我们追赶公交车的能力，或者我们听到朋友说话的能力。这些更大的功能属性会随着时间而退化，这都是由于分子和细胞层面累积的所有微小变化造成的。

生命系统之所以了不起，还在于我们是**开放系统**（Open Systems: 能够与环境进行物质和能量交换的系统），可以从环境中获取能量来维持自身。一般来说，非生命系统会以相对恒定的速度因**熵变**（Entropic Change: 系统趋向于无序或混乱状态的变化）而退化。但我们的系统已经适应，拥有缓冲和**韧性**（Resilience: 系统在面对干扰或压力时保持或恢复其功能的能力）。我们可以利用能量更长时间地维持我们的功能和结构，但随着时间的推移，这种能力最终会被超越，我们仍会看到这种失调和功能下降，同时韧性也会丧失。

衰老主要表现为功能障碍，这在许多与衰老相关的疾病中显而易见。一个很好的例子是糖尿病，我们看到代谢健康方面出现功能障碍，导致葡萄糖在循环系统中累积。但还有其他与功能障碍相关的衰老疾病，例如癌症，实际上是我们自身功能失调的细胞没有按最初设想的方式运作。许多衰老疾病都可以归因于特定器官系统的功能障碍和衰退。例如，糖尿病可以被视为我们代谢系统的衰退；阿尔茨海默病是中枢神经系统的衰退和功能障碍；另一种衰老疾病——**肌肉减少症**（Sarcopenia: 随着年龄增长而出现的肌肉质量和力量的进行性丧失），可以被视为包括代谢系统和肌肉骨骼系统在内的多个系统的衰退。

在科学界提出针对衰老的药物或治疗方法之前，目前**生活方式干预**（Lifestyle Interventions: 通过改变日常习惯和行为来促进健康的措施）是我们减缓衰老过程的最佳途径。这再次是因为生命系统具有适应性。我们适应环境，适应我们所经历的一切。因此，你可以通过不同的生活方式行为来增强**韧性**。例如，体育活动或锻炼可以增加我们的韧性，并缓冲我们未来可能面临的进一步压力。我们还知道，不同的饮食方案也能增加我们的韧性，并普遍减缓衰老过程。这些并非新事物，而是我们从小就被告知的常识，比如吃得好、睡得好、多锻炼、不吸烟。这些不应该让人感到惊讶，但我认为人们没有意识到这些习惯对他们衰老速度以及患上不同年龄相关疾病的倾向有多大的影响。

There's a lot of debate in the scientific field of aging whether aging is actually disease that should be treated like we treat diseases. My personal take on it is that aging is not actually a disease in and of itself but it's the process that actually contributes the most to many of the diseases we care about. So that being said, I actually think we should intervene and try and treat or at least slow the rate of aging, but we shouldn't think of it as a disease 'cause there isn't a clear point where you say you have aged a specific amount that you now have a disease. And we are all aging from the time we're born to the time we die. And ultimately what's important is how do we slow this process in an idea that will prevent many of the diseases that people are actually trying to treat. A lot of people think the aging field is focused on this concept of immortality or curing death or curing aging. That is a little bit fringe to I think a lot of the science that's going on. And really what the field is focusing on is how can we prevent the diseases of aging and keep people healthy for as long as possible. And if that ends up increasing life expectancy, that's almost a bonus. But the goal is not immortality. Our bodies are set up to function in a very specific way. This is something we've evolved, but over time that function does decline. And this is what we actually see in terms of manifestations of disease, diseases really, once your body has reached a dysfunctional state in terms of one type of process. And the reason that our bodies actually get to that point is because of all the changes we think that are accumulating as a function of this aging process. Granted, there can be other things like an infection or genetic kind of predisposition that might give people a disease, but most of the diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease are these progressive loss of function in our various systems that we think is directly driven by the aging process. So if we can actually figure out how to slow our aging rate internally, we think, and actually science has shown, that this will probably manifest in terms of our external appearance as well. Living systems are really remarkable. Through evolution, we've evolved to have this beautiful kind of coordination and specificity that kind of makes us who we are. So cells have specific roles, our organs are set up to function a specific way and this really gives us life. However, all of these things that are kind of determining the function of these organs and cells actually degrades with time. So we think of this as kind of the molecular changes that enable cells to function a certain way are rewritten with aging. And now cells actually lose their specificity, they become more dysfunctional. As you accumulate more dysfunctional cells in your tissues and organs, those organs are now not working the way they're originally intended to. And over time, as your organs start to dysfunction, you actually start seeing this at the whole body level. So we start seeing overall declines in our kind of bigger functional aspects. So just our ability to run for a bus, or our ability to hear our friend say something to us, these bigger functional attributes are actually degraded with time due to all these small changes that are accumulating at the molecular and cellular level. Living systems are also remarkable in that we're actually open systems, so we can take energy in from our environment and actually use that to sustain ourselves. So in general, non-living systems will kind of degrade in terms of this entropic change at a fairly constant rate. But actually our systems have adapted to actually have a buffer, resilience. We can use energy to maintain our kind of function and structure for much longer, but over time this will eventually get kind of overpowered and we will still see this kind of dysregulation and functional decline as we also see a loss of resilience. Aging is really personified by dysfunction, and we see a lot of this in the diseases that tend to arise with aging. So one great example is a disease like diabetes where we actually see dysfunction in terms of our metabolic health, where we get this accumulation of glucose throughout our circulation. But there are other diseases of aging that are also associated with dysfunction. So things like cancer are actually our own dysfunctional cells that are not behaving the way they were initially intended. Many diseases of aging can actually be attributed to dysfunction, decline in specific organ systems. So something like diabetes can be thought of as a decline in our metabolic system. Things like Alzheimer's disease are declines in dysfunction in our central nervous system. And another disease of aging called sarcopenia, which is actually the muscle wasting that we see with aging, can be thought of as declines in actually multiple systems including our metabolic system and also our musculoskeletal systems. Until the science actually up with drugs or treatments to actually try and target aging, lifestyle right now is actually our best ticket in terms of slowing our aging process. And this is really because, again, living systems are adaptive. We adapt to our environment, we adapt to the things we experience. So you can actually boost things like resilience through different lifestyle behaviors. So for instance, physical activity or exercise can actually increase our resilience and buffer us against further stressors down the road. We also know that different dietary regimens can actually increase our resilience as well and we think slow the aging process overall. And these aren't new things. These are things that we've been told about from, let's say, our mothers or grandmothers, you know, eat well, get good sleep, exercise, don't smoke. So these shouldn't be a surprise to people, but I think people don't realize how much these actually impact how fast they're gonna age and also their propensity for developing different age-related diseases.

### 逆转衰老：从细胞到整体的探索

作为科学界，我们正在思考是否能找到方法来减缓甚至逆转这些对衰老过程至关重要的生物学变化。我们尚不清楚能在多大程度上逆转整个身体的衰老，但我们确实知道可以逆转细胞的年龄。这在发育过程中发生，当雌雄细胞结合产生一个全新的“零岁”生物体时，尽管它们的父母可能已经二三十甚至四五十岁。在科学研究中，我们已在培养皿中实现了这一点。我们可以激活特定的因子，将一个75岁老人的皮肤细胞转化回几乎与胚胎细胞无异的状态。因此，我们知道至少在细胞层面，这是可能的。问题在于，我们能否在成年生物体中实现这一点？

对于那些已经足够大，可以参加高中同学聚会的人来说，例如20或30年后的聚会，你会发现并非所有人的外貌都与他们的**时间年龄**（Chronological Age: 从出生到现在的实际时间长度）相符，尽管他们可能确实是同龄人。有些人看起来和高中毕业时一模一样，仿佛18岁以后就没有变过，而另一些人你甚至可能认不出来。你会看着他们想：“我不可能那么老，我们没有衰老那么多。”因此，我们天生就知道人们的衰老速度不尽相同，有些人衰老得快，有些人衰老得慢。最终的问题是，如何才能成为一个慢衰老者？

就像我们讨论过的许多与衰老相关的事物一样，**表观基因组**（Epigenome: 基因组上所有表观遗传修饰的总和）再次显示出高度动态性。我们认为这些变化是双向的。你可以增加表观遗传年龄，但我们也已证明可以在细胞中逆转这一过程。**山中伸弥**（Shinya Yamanaka）因发现四种因子而获得诺贝尔奖，当这些因子在细胞中过度表达时，可以将一个衰老的细胞或任何细胞类型转化回类似胚胎干细胞的状态。后来，当科学家将**表观遗传时钟**（Epigenetic Clock: 基于DNA甲基化模式预测生物学年龄的算法模型）应用于这些数据时，我们发现不仅改变了细胞类型，还抹去或实质上逆转了我们用来量化生物学年龄的所有表观遗传变化。

那么问题来了，如何在体内实现这一点？我们能否将细胞从衰老的表观遗传状态“重编程”或“编程”回年轻的表观遗传状态？然后，这又对我们的生理和健康意味着什么？有些人可能会说，我们已经在培养皿中的细胞层面解决了衰老问题。我们可以让细胞衰老，也可以逆转它们的年龄，并将其重置为“零岁”。现在，人们正在尝试在生物体中实现这一点。目前，研究人员首先在小鼠身上进行实验，在不同的小鼠模型中，可以过度表达这四种通常被称为**山中伸弥因子**（Yamanaka Factors: 四种转录因子，可将体细胞重编程为诱导多能干细胞，从而逆转细胞的表观遗传年龄）的因子。科学家们观察到，这些小鼠的功能结果有所改善，寿命可能也有所延长，尽管这还需要进一步的跟踪研究。

这项科学最令人惊叹之处在于，我们一直认为衰老是单向发生的，这些只是随机的损伤，无法修复，因为它们太普遍、太多了，唯一能做的就是减缓这些损伤的累积。但**表观基因组重编程**（Reprogramming of the Epigenome: 通过改变表观遗传修饰来重置细胞状态或逆转其衰老过程）告诉我们，它比我们最初所知的更具可塑性和弹性。你只需使用少数几个因子，就可以将一个已经衰老并具有特定类型的细胞，完全改变其状态。这真正开启了**细胞工程**（Cell Engineering: 运用工程学原理和技术来设计、改造或控制细胞行为和功能的领域）的全新理念。我们如何将细胞转移到我们认为功能更强、更健康的状态？我们如何找出哪些状态能真正促进我们不同器官系统的健康和功能？一旦我们知道了这些状态，我们能否将不同的细胞转移到其中？

细胞在衰老过程中经历的许多变化，包括表观基因组的变化，实际上会导致一些疾病，如癌症。癌症风险随着年龄呈指数级增长。我们认为其中一部分原因可能与我们在观察表观基因组时测量的变化类型有关。因此，一个假设是，如果你能将表观基因组重塑或重编程到更年轻的状态，你实际上可能可以阻止一些细胞发展成癌症。这并不能解决可能先于癌症发生的一些突变，但实际上许多突变在生命早期就已累积。问题是，衰老过程中发生了什么，仍然在后期推动这些细胞癌变？

**表观遗传时钟**的显著之处在于，它能够追踪各种细胞类型和器官系统的衰老。你可以使用相同的测量方法来追踪皮肤、肝脏或血液中的衰老。更重要的是，我们发现表观遗传时钟预测的年龄与你的**时间年龄**（Chronological Age: 从出生到现在的实际时间长度）之间的差异具有生物学意义。我们认为它具有生物学意义的原因是，它似乎能够预测或指示在测量器官中可能出现的各种结果或疾病。因此，当我在血液中测量表观遗传年龄时，我们发现这个指标能够预测剩余寿命、心脏病风险或糖尿病等。我们还研究了大脑中测量的表观遗传年龄（这些是死后的人），我们发现它似乎与阿尔茨海默病相关的病理学有关。因此，我们认为，尽管我们尚未证明这直接导致了这些疾病，但它似乎是导致衰老疾病的衰老过程的一个标志。

随着我们不断开发和改进这些表观遗传时钟测量方法，它们将对追踪衰老和理解疾病风险等问题非常有帮助。最棒的是，表观遗传时钟测量不仅能提供全身的衰老指标，我们还可以在不同的子系统中进行测量，从而了解人们在身体不同系统中可能存在的差异化衰老。例如，有些人可能更容易出现代谢衰老，另一些人可能更容易出现炎症衰老。当你综合考虑这些特征时，它可能会更好地帮助你：一是确定应该在生活中实施的干预措施或生活方式因素；二是了解你可能面临的特定疾病风险。

科学家们之所以对干预衰老过程（无论是减缓还是逆转衰老过程）的想法如此兴奋，是因为我们认为这样做可以阻止导致我们所关心疾病的所有不同变化。因此，与其一次只针对一种疾病，用一种科学方法试图治愈癌症，另一种方法针对糖尿病，如果我们能够逆转或减缓衰老，我们就可以基本上消除疾病，或者至少全面推迟疾病的发生。目前，人们更多地将表观遗传时钟用作诊断工具，而非干预手段。人们将其作为衡量整体衰老的一个潜在指标。它并非完美的指标，也只捕捉了衰老过程的一个方面，但它能为人们提供一些关于健康状况以及罹患不同衰老疾病的整体风险的指示。

<summary>Original English Source</summary>

We actually think, as a science, whether we can actually figure out ways to slow or perhaps even reverse these biological changes that actually matter for the aging process. We don't know to what extent we can actually reverse aging in a whole body, although we do know that you can reverse the age of a cell. So this happens in development when you have two cells from a female and male that come together and produce an entirely new age-zero organism, even though they came from parents that perhaps were in their 20s or 30s or even 40s. And we've actually found that in science we can do this in a dish. So we can activate specific factors that can take, let's say, a skin cell from a 75-year-old and convert it back into something that's almost indistinguishable from a cell from an embryo. So we know that, at least at the cellular level, this is possible. The question is can you actually do that in an adult organism? For those of us that are actually old enough to get to go to our high school reunion, let's say your 20 or 30-year-old high school reunion, we know that if you were to go there, not everyone looks like they're at the same chronological age, even though they probably are. Some people look exactly like they did when you graduated high school, so they haven't changed since they were 18, whereas there might be other people who you don't even recognize. And you look at them and you think, "I can't possibly be that old, we haven't aged that much." So we know inherently that people don't all age at the same rate, and some of us are going to be faster agers and some of us are gonna be slower agers. And ultimately the question is how do you become a slow ager? Like many of the things we've talked about in terms of aging, the epigenome, again, is highly dynamic. These are things that can go, we think, in both directions. So you can increase epigenetic age, but we've also shown that you can actually reverse this in cells. So Shinya Yamanaka actually won the Nobel Prize for discovering four factors that, when you overexpress these in cells, it can convert an old cell or basically any cell type back into what looks like an embryonic stem cell. And later as scientists were actually applying things like the epigenetic clock to this data, we found that not only are you changing the cell type, but you're also erasing or essentially reversing all those epigenetic changes that we've actually used to try and quantify biological age. So then the question becomes how do you do this in a body? Can you actually what we call reprogram or program cells from an old epigenetic state back into a younger epigenetic state? And then the question becomes what does this actually mean for our physiology and our health? So some people might actually say that we have solved the aging problem with cells in a dish. We can age cells, and we can reverse their age and essentially reset them to an age zero. And then people are now trying to actually do this in an organism. So right now to start out, people are doing this in mice where again, in different mouse models, you can over express these four factors commonly referred to as Yamanaka factors. And the scientists have actually observed that the mice seem to have improvements in different functional outcomes and there perhaps might be an increase in life expectancy, although this needs to be followed up a little bit more. The most amazing thing about this science is that we always thought aging really happened in one direction, that these were just stochastic damage that you couldn't go back and fix because there was just so widespread and so much of it, and that the only thing you could really do was just slow the accumulation of this damage. But really what this reprogramming of the epigenome tells us is that this is a lot more kind of modifiable and elastic than we originally knew. So you can actually take a cell that has aged and is of a given type and completely change its state using just a few factors. And so this really opens up this whole idea of things like cell engineering. So how do we take cells and move them to states that we actually think more functional and healthier? And how do we figure out what types of states actually give rise to health and function in our different organ systems? And then once we know those states, can we move different cells into them? A lot of the changes that cells undergo with aging, including changes to the epigenome, actually give rise to some diseases like cancer. So the risk of cancer actually increases exponentially with age. And we think some of this might be due to the types of changes that are measured when we look at the epigenome. So one hypothesis is if you can actually remodel or reprogram the epigenome to a younger state, that you actually might prevent some of these cells from developing into cancers. Now that won't deal with some of the mutations that might proceed cancer, but actually a lot of mutations accumulate early in the lifespan. And the question is, what is happening with aging that is still later on pushing these cells to become cancerous? The epigenetic clock has been really remarkable in that it can actually track aging across a diverse array of cell types and organ systems. So you can use the same measure to track aging in your skin as you would use in your liver or in your blood. And more importantly, what we find is actually the difference between the age you get predicted based on the epigenetic clock and your chronological age holds biological meaning. And the reason we think it holds biological meaning is because it actually seems to be somewhat predictive or indicative of different kind of outcomes or diseases in whichever organ it was measured in. So when I measure epigenetic age in the blood, what we find is that that measure is actually predictive of things like remaining life expectancy or heart disease risk or diabetes. We've actually looked at epigenetic age measured in the brain, these are people after they've died. But what we find is that that seems to be correlated with the pathology associated with things like Alzheimer's disease. So we think even though we haven't proven that this is causally driving these diseases, it does seem to be a signature for the aging processes that seem to give rise to the diseases of aging. As we continue to develop and improve these epigenetic clock measures, they'll actually be highly useful for tracking things like aging and actually understanding things like disease risk. So the great thing is that epigenetic clock measures aren't just giving you a whole-body aging measure, but we can actually measure it in different subsystems and understand how people might be differently aging across different systems in their body. So some people might be more prone to metabolic aging, other people might be more prone to kind of inflammatory aging. And that profile, when you take it all into consideration, might give you a better idea of, one, the interventions or the lifestyle factors that you should actually implement in your life, or two, the specific diseases that you might be more or less at risk for. The reason why scientists are so excited about the idea of intervening in the aging process, whether it be slowing the aging process or reversing the aging process, is because we actually think that in doing so we can stop all of the different changes that are giving rise to the diseases that we care about. So rather than going after one disease at a time and having, you know, one type of science aimed at trying to cure cancer and another aimed at diabetes, if we actually could reverse or slow aging, we could basically eliminate diseases or at least postpone diseases across the board. Right now people are using the epigenetic clock as more of a diagnostic as opposed to a means to intervene. So people are using it as potentially one indicator of how they're aging overall. It's not a perfect indicator, and it's only capturing one facet of the aging process, but it can give people some indication of their health status and potentially their overall risk of developing different diseases of aging.

### 营养策略：延缓衰老的关键路径

营养科学一直是长寿和衰老领域备受关注的话题。数百年来，人们一直在研究饮食、食物摄入量和食物种类如何影响衰老。然而，这项科学研究非常困难，至少在人类身上，很难将特定饮食分配给人们，并让他们长时间维持这些饮食，以进行随机临床试验。因此，科学家通常依赖**流行病学或观察性数据**（Epidemiological or Observational Data: 通过观察人群及其生活习惯与健康结果之间的关联来收集的数据）。他们研究不同人群的饮食习惯，然后观察这些人群的特征，如**生物学年龄**（Biological Age: 反映个体生理功能和细胞分子层面衰老程度的指标）、疾病风险或预期寿命，以判断某些饮食是否与特定结果相关。但问题在于，很难确定饮食是否真正导致了这些结果，而且那些倾向于健康饮食的人通常也伴随着其他健康行为。因此，弄清楚饮食中哪些成分真正重要非常困难。

在衰老和长寿领域，研究最多的主要饮食成分是**热量限制**（Caloric Restriction: 减少总热量摄入但不导致营养不良的饮食方式）。一百多年前，研究人员发现，当他们限制动物的卡路里摄入量时，动物的寿命往往更长。这激发了整个热量限制研究领域。热量限制并非饥饿，通常只是将总卡路里摄入量减少约20%。在许多不同的动物模型中，从蠕虫、果蝇到小鼠，人们都观察到，当动物进行热量限制时，它们的寿命会延长。然而，一个需要注意的因素是，这可能因遗传背景而异。一项对小鼠的研究表明，具有不同遗传背景的小鼠，有些受益于热量限制，有些则没有影响，甚至有些情况更糟。因此，我们认为身体能承受的热量限制量可能由基因决定，这应该是一种更个性化的方案。

在判断热量限制是否对减缓衰老过程有益时，一个需要注意的问题是，今天的人类并非处于“基线”状态，我们更容易过度饮食。因此，一些研究人员发现，真正有益的可能并非热量限制本身，而是避免过度饮食的倾向。即使你无法严格按照热量限制研究中的标准限制卡路里，仅仅避免过度消费或过度饮食，并使摄入量更符合你实际的卡路里需求（基于你的能量消耗），对大多数人来说也可能产生有益效果。热量限制的发现纯属偶然。科学家最初并非为了研究饮食如何影响衰老和长寿，而是偶然发现，当他们的实验动物（本例中是老鼠）摄入较低卡路里饮食时，寿命更长。这一发现几百年前首次出现后，人们持续研究，并在20世纪70年代、80年代乃至今天成为一个热门话题，人们试图弄清楚将卡路里减少到这种最小赤字，如何能延长寿命和健康的无病寿命。

饮食可能是研究最多的一种行为，旨在影响衰老和长寿。在动物实验中，它对预期寿命有显著影响。但这并不意味着你的饮食必须极端。当我们说它会产生巨大影响时，这可能仅仅意味着避免某些饮食，比如过度消费或食用大量我们已知对身体有害的食物，并维持一种适度、符合我们日常能量需求的饮食。

有三个主要的饮食组成部分似乎影响着衰老：
1.  **摄入量**（How much we eat）：大量科学研究集中在热量限制上，但实际上，关键在于保持轻微的赤字或不赤字。我们大多数人无法终生维持20%的卡路里赤字。但只要我们能满足与能量消耗相符的需求，并且不过度消费，我们认为这对整体衰老和健康都会有益。
2.  **食物种类**（What we eat）：另一项研究是关于我们吃什么。大量研究探讨了植物性饮食是否对衰老和长寿有益，似乎有一些证据表明，适度低动物蛋白饮食（即少吃动物产品，多吃水果蔬菜，多吃全食）总体上会更好。同时，也要尽量减少精制糖和我们已知对健康有害的食物。
3.  **进食时间**（When we eat）：这是衰老和长寿科学领域的一个新方向。同样，大多数人无法进行严格的热量限制，但科学家发现**禁食**（Fasting: 在特定时间段内不进食）可以模拟热量限制的一些益处。如果人们每天禁食数小时，例如将进食时间限制在一个小窗口内，我们认为这可以重现热量限制研究中的许多益处。关于这个窗口应该何时出现，仍有一些争议。一些科学家倾向于“前置卡路里”，即在一天早些时候进食，然后全天禁食。但我们也不确定，对许多人来说，反向操作（只吃晚餐，早些时候进行热量限制）可能更容易。所以我们不确定这是否会产生与早些时候禁食相同的益处。

热量限制或禁食之所以能改善衰老过程并增进健康，是因为我们认为这会在体内引发**应激适应性**（Hormesis: 低剂量应激源对生物体产生有益效应，使其对后续更强应激源更具抵抗力）的概念。应激适应性指的是一种轻微的应激源，它能使我们的身体随着时间的推移对压力更具韧性和抵抗力。因此，这些短期的轻微应激源，无论是禁食还是少量卡路里赤字，实际上都能使我们的身体更强健，我们认为对许多随着衰老而增加的变化更具抵抗力。

我们吃什么也可能因人而异。我们知道基因可能决定我们应该吃什么以及吃多少，但我们的年龄也可能改变我们应该吃什么以及吃多少。例如，老年人更容易出现肌肉流失或虚弱，可能需要比年轻人更多的蛋白质，而科学研究表明低蛋白饮食可能对年轻人有益。因此，重要的是要记住，这些并非一成不变，需要个性化考虑。弄清楚我们每个人的最佳或理想饮食并不容易。我们不清楚基因如何使人们倾向于不同的饮食，但一种方法是追踪许多健康指标，例如我们的**生物学年龄**（Biological Age: 反映个体生理功能和细胞分子层面衰老程度的指标）测量，以实际观察饮食对我们的影响。如果你完全改变饮食或引入间歇性禁食，你是否会在测量结果中看到反映？另一方面，还有你的功能感受。随着年龄增长，人们可能更容易出现虚弱或肌肉萎缩，他们可能希望增加饮食中的蛋白质，以确保维持一些可能随时间下降的功能。

随着科学的进步，以及更多衰老生物标志物的开发，我认为这将真正加速我们对饮食如何影响衰老过程的理解。但就目前而言，我们可以说，最好的建议可能是不吃太多，并尽量保持一种全食、有机饮食，其中动物蛋白不要过多。

Nutrition science is actually something that people in the longevity and aging field have been very interested in. And actually for hundreds of years, people have been studying how our diets and the amount of food and types of food we eat seem to impact our aging. But the science is also really difficult because, at least in humans, it's hard to actually assign people specific diets and actually have them maintain those for a long enough time to study them in kind of this randomized clinical trial way. So usually what scientists end up kind of leaning on is what we call epidemiological or observational data. So they look at populations and they compare the diets that different people eat, and then they look at kind of the features of those people. Using things like biological aging or disease risk or life expectancy, do certain diets tend to correlate with certain outcomes? The problem with this is it's really hard to say anything about whether the diet is actually causing those things, and also people who tend to have healthier diets also have other health behaviors that go along with them. So figuring out exactly what components of diet matter is really difficult. The main dietary component that's actually been studied in the aging and longevity field is actually this idea of caloric restriction. So more than a hundred years ago, researchers actually saw that when they restrict the amount of calories that animals eat, they tended to live longer. And so this really sparked an entire field of studying this concept of caloric restriction. Caloric restriction isn't starvation, it's usually just about a 20% reduction in the overall calorie intake. And in a lot of different animal models, so anything from a worm, fly, mouse, people have seen that when animals are caloric restricted, they tend to live longer. One caveat though is that this actually may be different depending on genetics. So there was a study in mice that actually showed mice with different genetic backgrounds. Some of them benefited from chloric restriction, some of them had no effect, and then actually some of them did worse. So we actually think that the amount of chloric restriction our bodies can tolerate might be genetically determined and that actually this should be a more personalized regimen. When trying to figure out if something like caloric restriction is actually beneficial to the aging process in terms of slowing aging, one caveat is that humans today are actually not kind of at baseline. We're actually more prone to overeating. So some researchers have figured out that it might not be the caloric restriction that's actually the beneficial thing but the kind of tendency away from overeating. Even if you can't restrict your calories in terms of what's actually been studied in caloric restriction, just moving away from over consumption or overeating and being more in line with your actual caloric needs, based on your energy out, is probably gonna have a beneficial effect for most people. The discovery of caloric restriction was on accident. So the scientists weren't actually going in to try and study how diet was affecting aging and longevity. But they just happened to find that when their, in this case it was rats, were eating a lower-calorie diet, they tended to live longer. And after that was first discovered a few hundred years ago, people continued to study this, and it really became a big deal in kind of the 1970s and 1980s and moving even into today where people have tried to figure out what is the mechanism by which reducing your calories into this kind of minimal deficit produces a kind of extension in terms of life expectancy and healthy disease-free life expectancy. Diet is probably the behavior that's been studied the most in terms of trying to affect things like aging and longevity. So in animals it's shown to have a quite marked effect on life expectancy. But it doesn't mean that your diet has to be extreme. So when we say it's gonna have a big effect, this might just mean avoiding certain diets like overconsumption or eating a lot of things that we actually already know are bad for us and just maintaining a moderate diet that is in line with our energy needs on a daily basis. There are really three components of diet that seem to be impacting aging. So the first is how much we eat, the second is what we eat, and the third is perhaps when we eat. So in terms of how much we eat, a lot of science went into this idea of caloric restriction, but really, again, it's maintaining even a slight deficit to no deficit. So most of us aren't going to be able to maintain a 20% calorie deficit for our whole life. But as long as we can meet needs that are in line with our energy expenditure and we're not over-consuming, we think that's gonna have a benefit for overall aging in health. The other thing that's been studied is this concept of what we eat. So a lot of research has gone into whether things like a plant-based diet are actually beneficial to aging longevity, and there seems to be some evidence that a moderately low animal protein diets, so eating less animal products, more fruits and veggies, more whole foods is gonna be better overall. Also minimizing things like refined sugars and the things that we actually know are bad for our health. The third comes down to when we eat, and this is really a new field in kind of aging and longevity science. So again, most people aren't gonna be able to calorically restrict, but what scientists found is actually fasting can mimic some of the benefits that we've seen with caloric restriction. So if people can fast for, you know, a number of hours throughout the day, so perhaps minimize their eating to a small window, we think that this can actually recapitulate a lot of the benefits that we're seeing in the caloric restriction studies. So there's still some debate about when that window should occur. So some of the scientists actually pointing to front loading your calories, so eating earlier in the day and trying to fast throughout the day. But we're also not sure, for a lot of people it's easier to do the opposite and have just a dinner and calorically restrict early. So we're not sure actually if that would have the same benefit as doing it earlier. The idea of why things like caloric restriction or fasting might actually improve our aging process and increase our health is because we think this kind of evokes this idea of hormesis in our bodies. So what hormesis refers to is a mild stressor that actually makes our bodies more resilient and robust distress over time. So having these short-term mild stressors, whether it be fasting or whether it be a small caloric deficit, actually makes our bodies more robust and we think more resilient against a lot of the changes we see that increase with aging. So what we eat may also change depending on who we are. So we also know that our genetics might determine what we should be eating and how much, but also our age might change what we should be eating and how much. So people who are older and more prone to things like muscle loss or weakness might actually need more protein than people who are younger, where science has actually shown that a low-protein diet might be beneficial. So it's important to keep in mind that these things aren't set in stone and really need to be considered on a personalized basis. It's not that easy to figure out what the optimal or ideal diet is for each of us. We don't know exactly how things like genetics are going to predispose people to different diets, but one way to do this is to actually keep track of a lot of these health indices, things like our biological age measures to actually see how our diet is affecting us. So if you were to completely change your diet or introduce something like intermittent fasting, do you see that reflected in your measures? The other things are just functionally how you're feeling. So as people get older and, again, might be more prone to things like weakness or muscle wasting, they might actually want to increase things like protein in their diet to make sure they're maintaining some of these functions that they might see declining with time. As we move forward in the science and actually develop more of these biomarkers of aging, I think this will really start to accelerate our understanding of how diet impacts the aging process. But for now, what we can say is that probably the best advice is to not eat too much and try and maintain kind of a whole foods organic diet with not too much animal protein in it.

### 健康寿命：超越长寿的终极目标

长期以来，人们一直沉迷于永生和衰老的想法。但问题是，更长的生命真的是更好的生命吗？在某些情况下，也许是，但并非总是如此。对大多数人来说，真正重要的是**生活质量**（Quality of Life: 个体对其生活状况的满意度和幸福感）。我们都希望保持健康和功能，能够享受那些让生活值得的事情。因此，衰老科学的真正意义并非不惜一切代价延长生命，而是延长**健康寿命**（Health Span: 指个体在健康、无疾病状态下生活的年限）。我们能否延迟疾病的发生？能否延迟功能衰退的开始？并尽可能长时间地保持人们的健康和功能？我们认为，如果我们真正干预衰老过程本身，就可以延迟所有人们在想到衰老时所恐惧的事情。这才是真正的目标。我们希望提高生活质量并长期维持，如果这能带来更长的寿命，那只是额外的奖励，但并非最终目标。

我们知道，**寿命**（Lifespan: 从出生到死亡的总时间）和**健康寿命**这两个概念有时存在脱节。寿命是指从出生到死亡的时间长度。而科学家所说的健康寿命，是指你在健康功能状态下活着的时间。这才是我们真正努力优化的目标。但有时我们会在这两个特征之间看到脱节或不一致。一个例子是我们在男性和女性之间看到的**健康生存悖论**（Health Survival Paradox: 指某些群体（如女性）虽然寿命更长，但可能在晚年经历更多与年龄相关的疾病和残疾）。平均而言，全世界的女性比男性寿命长几年。但女性也更容易患上一些与衰老相关的疾病，如关节炎、阿尔茨海默病。平均而言，女性在一些与年龄相关的残疾上花费的时间往往比男性更多。有些人可能会争辩说，因为她们活得更长，所以这是一种更好的生活吗？或者你是否会想要更短的生命，但更少地受到这些衰老疾病的困扰？

在思考我们如何干预衰老以及我们希望科学取得何种成果时，这归结为一个我们称之为**疾病压缩**（Compression of Morbidity: 将疾病和残疾的发生时间推迟到生命末期，从而延长健康寿命）的概念。这个想法是，我们能否将疾病和残疾的发生时间尽可能地推迟，以便在你去世前，将疾病的时间压缩到一个非常短的窗口，而不是在生命早期就患上这些衰老疾病并与之共存20、30或40年？我们认为这是可能的，因为你可以观察百岁老人群体，他们往往会将疾病的发生时间压缩到死亡前的一个短窗口期。因此，他们生命的大部分时间都处于更健康的状态。我们真正想做的是弄清楚如何让每个人都能实现这一点，以便我们能够尽可能长时间地保持健康、功能良好、快乐并拥有高质量的生活。

在长寿科学方面，另一个非常重要的事情是，我们实际上不希望增加**健康差距**（Health Disparities: 不同人群之间在健康状况和医疗服务获取方面的差异）。目前，尽管人口的平均预期寿命略低于80岁，但我们希望确保每个人都能拥有更长寿、更健康的生活，而不是只让富裕或更富裕的人群通过干预或治疗实现这一目标。我们真正需要做的是，确保每个人都能尽可能地拥有健康长寿的生活。

People have been really consumed with the idea of immortality and aging for a very long time. But the question is, is a longer life truly a better life? And in some cases, perhaps yes, but not always. So really what matters to most people is quality of life. So we all want to maintain our health and our functions and be able to enjoy the things that actually make life worth living. So really what aging science is about is not just prolonging life at all cost, but actually prolonging healthy life. So can we delay the onset of disease? Can we delay the onset of functional decline and keep people healthy and functioning for as long as possible? So we think if we actually intervene in the aging process itself, that we can delay all of the things that actually people are scared about when they think of aging. And that's really the goal. We want to increase quality of life and maintain that over time. And if that produces a longer life, that's an extra bonus. But that's not the ultimate goal. We know that there is sometimes a disconnect between this concept, what we call lifespan and health span. So lifespan, again, is just the time you've been alive between birth and death. And what scientists think health span is is the time you are alive in a more healthy functioning state. And that's really what we're trying to optimize. But sometimes we see a disconnect or discordance between these two features. So one example is actually this idea of the health survival paradox that we see between men and women. So on average, women across the world tend to live longer by a few years than men. But women are also more prone to some of the diseases we see with aging. So things like arthritis, Alzheimer's disease. And really on average, women tend to spend more time in some of this age-related disability than men do. And some might argue is that a better life because they've lived longer? Or would you actually want maybe a shorter life but more free from these diseases of aging? In thinking about how we actually want to intervene in aging and what we want to be the outcome of our science, this really comes down to this concept that we call compression of morbidity. So the idea is, can we push the onset of disease and disability as far away so that right before you die, you're really compressing the timing of disease into this really short window, as opposed to kind of having it earlier in life and surviving 20, 30 or 40 years with these diseases of aging? And we think this is possible 'cause you can actually look at centenarian populations and see that they actually tend to compress the timing of disease into the short window right before death. So they're spending the majority of their life in a much more healthy state. And really what we want to do is figure out how can we have this possible for everyone so that we can remain healthy, functioning and happy with good quality of life for as long as possible. Another really important thing to keep in mind, in terms of longevity science, is that we actually don't wanna increase what we call health disparities. So right now, even though the average kind of life expectancy in the population is just under about 80 years, we wanna make sure that we can get everyone to a longer and healthier life and not just have interventions or therapeutics that help richer or more affluent people get there. And really how do we make sure that everyone can have as healthy and long a life as possible.
