### 研究缘起：愤怒表情的困惑

**主持人**: 你好！我们来聊聊这项研究，首先想问，为什么？你为什么想研究这个？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How are you doing?
>> I'm doing well.
How about you?
>> I am doing great.
Let's talk about anger first
with this study.
I guess the first question is
why?
Why did you want to look into
this?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。其实在 2020 年，当 **埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk)** 接管了以前的 Twitter，现在的 **X** 时，很多人都在网上给他施加了很大的压力。而他很多时候的回应都是一个笑哭的表情。以至于人们开始注意到这一点。我读到过一篇博客文章，指出他相比其他表情符号，使用了多少这个表情。如果你搜索“埃隆·马斯克 笑哭表情”，你会找到海量的新闻报道，关于他如何用这个表情回应各种争议。我当时就很好奇，因为这并不是我第一反应会想到的愤怒回应。那是一个笑哭的表情，而不是“生气”，对吧？所以我就很好奇，在这个新的网络空间、数字景观中，我们是如何表达和解读愤怒的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah.
So actually in 2020, when Elon
Musk took over what's formerly
Twitter now X, a lot of people
were giving him a really hard
time online.
And he responded a lot of the
time with a laughing, crying
emoji.
So much so that people started
pointing it out.
I read an article like a blog
article pointing out how much
he's been using it in comparison
to other emojis.
If you look up Elon Musk
laughing crying emoji, you'll
get like tons and tons of news
articles about how he's
responded to some sort of
controversy with this emoji.
And I was just really curious,
because that's not what I would
immediately think of as an angry
response.
That's a laughing, crying emoji.
Not like GR, right?
So I was really curious, how are
we expressing, how are we
interpreting anger in this new
space of online like online
spaces in digital landscapes?

</details>

**主持人**: 我之前都不知道这个。我正在想我最近一个帖子或评论，用的就是笑然后一个滚动的笑脸。现在我也得重新思考一下了。请帮助我们理解，你知道，我们很多人，包括作为记者，我们都经历过在网上发布一些我们认为无伤大雅或信息性的内容，结果突然发现意想不到的愤怒反应。请帮助我们理解，人们在网上是不是比在现实生活中更容易表现出愤怒？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I didn't even know that.
And I'm trying to think of the
last kind of post that I or
comment that I had, and it was
exactly a laugh and then a
rolling smile.
So now I need to rethink that as
well.
Help us understand, you know,
many of us and as a journalist
as well, many of us have
experienced posting something we
think is innocent online or
something that's informative and
suddenly finding, let's say,
unexpected angry reactions help
us understand.
Do people tend to act or react
more angrily online than they
would perhaps in real life?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。愤怒是一种高唤醒度的情绪，这意味着它是我们更倾向于采取行动的情绪之一。所以，即使你的帖子有 100 个人看到，25 个人觉得“酷，太棒了”，25 个人觉得“哦，这让我有点沮丧”，而 50 个人觉得“哦，我生气了”。这 50 个人比另外 50 个人更有可能评论、互动或分享。仅仅因为它是高唤醒度的情绪，意味着他们想要行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> So yeah.
So anger is a high arousal
emotion, which means that it's
one of the emotions that we're
more incentivised to act upon.
So even if you have 100 eyes on
your post, 25 people are like,
cool, that's that's great.
25 people are like, oh, that
bums me out.
And then 50 people are like, oh,
I'm.
Those 50 people are more likely
than those other 50 people to
comment or engage or share or
talk about it.
Just because it's that high
arousal emotion means that they
want to act.

</details>

### 数字环境与平台影响

**主持人**: 现在，请帮助我们理解数字环境本身。环境中的哪些因素会导致这些愤怒的反应？我猜当我们谈论愤怒的评论、愤怒的反应时，我首先想到的是全大写的那种尖叫和吼叫，但我们也知道，它可能像在短信中句末加个句号那样微妙。这可能只是一个代际差异。对某些人来说，可能是表情符号。但数字环境中存在哪些因素会导致这种情况“发酵”呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Now, help us understand the
the digital environment itself.
What factors in the environment
contribute to these angry
reactions?
I'm assuming when we talk about
angry comments, angry reactions,
I'm thinking right off the bat
all caps kind of screaming and
yelling, but we know it's as
subtle as something, even in
text messages, as putting a
period at the end of a sentence.
That might just be a
generational thing.
For some people, it could be the
emojis.
But what are the factors in the
digital environment that allow
for this to to kind of fester?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。其中一个主要因素其实是它所在的平台。你已经提到了。在人际沟通中，在那种短信环境中，它更可能是我们所谓的“冷愤怒”，在这种情况下，你更在意控制自己的形象，表现得冷静、镇定。而像 TikTok 则更有可能是支持性的。那是我实际发现的少数几个地方之一。当我预期会有愤怒评论时，我发现很多人在改变叙事，积极地选择支持。然后有传闻说 Instagram 更容易引发愤怒。在 Reddit 上，你更有可能看到长篇博客文章。所以，这再次取决于你所处的实际平台环境，以及该平台的社交规范。例如，在 Instagram 上，互相欺凌的情况稍微普遍一些，而在 TikTok 上，采取行动并积极选择支持则更常见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah.
So one of the main things is
actually the platform that it's
on.
So you already touched on that.
So in interpersonal
communication, in that texting
environment it's more likely to
be what we call cold anger,
where you're a little bit more
invested in controlling your
image, coming across as very
calm collected and then also
like TikTok is more likely to be
supportive.
That's one of the only places
that I actually found.
When I expected angry comments,
I found a lot of people changing
the narrative, actively deciding
to be supportive.
And then there's anecdotal
evidence that says that
Instagram is more likely to be
angry.
You're more likely to get long
blog posts based off of the
format in Reddit.
So it just again, it depends on
the environment of the actual
platform that you're on, and
then also the social norms of
that platform.
So on Instagram, it's a little
bit more common to bully each
other, whereas TikTok it's a
little bit more common to take
that step and actively be
choosing to be supportive.

</details>

**主持人**: 你能举一个例子吗？一个在你说到的那些平台上会被不同看待的故事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Can you give us an example of
a story that would be kind of
viewed differently amongst some
of those platforms that you, you
had named?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。我实际上做研究时，专门针对的是关于 **加拿大住房危机** 的帖子。所以，其中一件事是，帖子本身在 Reddit 上可能就是一种不同的形式。它通常是一个文章链接或文章的摘要。而在 TikTok 上，它可能是一个街头采访，比如：“你拥有房子吗？”然后一位年轻女士说：“是的，我拥有房子。”但也有人只是在谈论他们的观点之类的。所以，稍微更……不像 Reddit 那样正式，在 Reddit 上，他们会说：“好的，这些是事实。这些是我们要讨论的新闻文章，你知道，尽量保持基于事实。”而在 TikTok 上，则稍微更……你知道，随性一些。我们只是在谈论我们的观点，我们的感受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah.
So I actually did my research on
specifically posts that were
about the Canadian housing
crisis.
So one of the things is that
just the post itself was going
to probably be a different
format on Reddit.
It was often a link to an
article or a synopsis of an
article on TikTok.
It could be, for example, the
one with the support that was
just an interview on the street,
and they were like, oh, do you
own a house?
And this young woman said, yes,
I own a house.
But then there's also people
just talking about their
opinions and stuff like that.
So a little bit more.
Not as formal as Reddit, where
they're like, okay, like these
are the facts.
Like these are the news articles
that we're going to be talking
about, you know, try and keep it
grounded, whereas TikTok is a
little bit more, you know,
loosey goosey.
We're just talking about our
opinions, how we feel.

</details>

### “愤怒诱饵”现象的经济驱动力

**主持人**: 好的。除了人们如何回复帖子，一些平台似乎是故意这样做。有些账号会发布所谓的 **“愤怒诱饵”（rage baiting）**，据我所知，它曾是牛津词典的年度词汇（2025 年）。为什么不是“快乐诱饵”或“悲伤诱饵”呢？“愤怒诱饵”到底是什么？我不知道我刚才是不是创造了一个新词，但“愤怒诱饵”到底是什么？为什么是关于愤怒的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right.
Aside from how people reply to
posts, some outlets appear to do
this intentionally.
Some accounts where what is
known as rage baiting, which
was, from what I understand,
Oxford Dictionaries 2025 word of
the year.
Why not joy baiting or sad?
What is it about rage baiting?
I don't know if I just coined a
term there, but yeah, what is it
about rage baiting?
Why is it about anger?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 我很喜欢“快乐诱饵”这个说法。是的。再次回到高唤醒度情绪，这能带来更多钱。所以我们更有可能获得那些点击、分享、评论，让人们真正地谈论它。文献表明，尤其是与快乐相比，我们更倾向于以积极的方式参与愤怒，而不是快乐。所以，归根结底，这是底线。什么能为我们带来最多的钱？尤其是在网红时代，你赚的钱完全取决于你的帖子获得了多少互动。激怒人们并让他们在那个层面上与你互动，可以非常有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah, I would love joy
baiting.
Yeah.
So again, going back to that
high arousal emotion, it's just
going to make more money.
So we're more likely to get
those clicks, those shares,
those comments, people actually
talking about it.
We there.
The literature suggests that
especially compared to Joy
specifically, we're much more
likely to engage in that active
way with anger than we are with
joy.
So it's just at the end of the
day, it's the bottom line.
What's making us the most money,
especially like in an era of
like influencers, where what the
money that you make depends
quite literally on how much
engagement you're getting on
your post.
It can be very effective to
upset people and get them to
engage with you on that level.

</details>

**主持人**: 你能举个例子吗？我想到了快乐诱饵，我想到了猫，我爱猫，我家里有只猫，我想到了这些可爱的视频，然后是愤怒诱饵。什么？你能举些例子说明当我们认为某事是愤怒诱饵时，人们可能会看到什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Can you give an example?
I'm thinking of joy baiting.
I'm thinking of cats, I love
cats, I have a cat at home
thinking of these cute videos
and then rage baiting.
What?
Give me some examples of what
people might be used to seeing
when it's when when we consider
something as rage baiting.

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的，我遇到的很多愤怒诱饵都与移民有关，因为，再次强调，那场加拿大住房危机。所以，就是一些关于移民和政治的宽泛说法，这些说法不一定基于现实，只是非常非常宽泛的说法，可以让任何人感到愤怒。无论你站在哪个政治光谱，可能都会感到愤怒，因为它不一定基于事实，但它是一个非常非常情绪化的话题，而且常常有点冒犯性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah, a lot of the rage bait
that I encountered was about
immigration, because, again,
that Canadian housing crisis.
And so just broad statements
that aren't necessarily grounded
in reality about immigration and
politics, just really, really
broad statements that can kind
of make anyone angry.
It doesn't necessarily matter
where you land on the political
spectrum just because it's, you
know, not necessarily grounded
in fact, but it is a very, very
emotional subject and it often
is a little bit offensive.

</details>

### 在线愤怒的现实溢出效应

**主持人**: 好的，我们来谈谈，就以移民为例。你知道，就像你说的，它在网上有所发展。但我们也看到了抗议活动，你知道，在这场全国性的对话中，双方都有。我们是否越来越多地在网上接触到激烈的愤怒？这对我们的现实世界有什么影响？我认为很多人认为它在网上是受保护的，有点像在…….com 上。但它是否……我们是否看到了溢出效应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, let's talk about let's
use immigration as an example.
You know, something that, as you
said, kind of grew online.
But we did see protests, you
know, on both sides of the coin
on that conversation across the
country, are we increasingly
exposed to hot anger online?
And what impact does that have?
Sort of in our real world?
I think a lot of us think that
it is kind of protected, sort of
on the, on the.com.
But there is are we seeing
spill-over?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。就像你说的，我们有点……我们感觉有点受保护。这被称为“**社会隔离**”的观念，即我们看不到屏幕上的另一个人。所以他们就好像不再真实了。后果是我们不会考虑他们。所以，在现实生活中，我可能不太愿意对我不同意的人大喊大叫，但在网上我更可能这样做，因为对方如何看待我、我的社交地位不会因为这次互动而受到威胁。我认为我们确实看到了一些溢出效应，但仍然存在一些社会规范，阻止我们在现实生活中表现不当，而在网络空间中则不然。所以很多人会说，在这些网络空间里，我以为这很正常。然后我走出来，和真人交谈，你知道，这比我最初想的要复杂得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah.
So we like you said, we're a
little bit we feel a little bit
protected.
It's called like a social
isolation idea where we can't
see the other person on the
screen.
So they kind of stop being real.
And the consequences are we
don't think of them.
So whereas in person, I might be
less likely to scream and yell
at someone who disagrees with
me.
I'm more likely to do that
online just because the
consequences of how they
perceive me, of my, you know,
social standing is aren't in
peril from this engagement.
I do think that we are a little
bit seeing spill-over, but there
is still those social mores that
inhibit us from behaving poorly
in person in a way that we don't
see in online spaces.
So a lot of people will like,
talk about like in these online
spaces.
I, I thought that this was
really normal.
And then I came out of it and it
like and I talked to real people
and you know, it's a lot more
nuanced than maybe I'd initially
thought.

</details>

**主持人**: 这么说来，我们是不是正在变成一个更愤怒的社会？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> With that being said, are we
becoming an angrier society?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 我无法肯定地说，这肯定有点超出了我研究的范围，但我们确实在网上变得更习惯于互相攻击了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I couldn't say that's
definitely a little bit out of
the scope of my research, but
definitely we are becoming more
comfortable with being
aggressive with each other in
online spaces specifically.

</details>

### 应对在线愤怒的建议

**主持人**: 好的。我的最后一个问题是，你知道，对于很多人来说，他们可能正在用手机看这个节目，他们每天都感受到在线愤怒的重压，你会给普通人什么建议？我们能做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right.
My last question to you is, you
know, for someone for a lot of
people who are on their phones
probably watching this segment
on their phones as well, what
advice would you give to
ordinary folks who are feeling
the weight of online anger on a
daily basis?
What can we do?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的，绝对。第一，退一步。试着记住，另一端的人也是人。这是我一直要提醒自己的事情，他们不一定有意伤害我。他们只是没有把我当人来看待。他们把我当成……你知道，一个网络的空白画布。另外，也要记住，谁在从你的愤怒中获利？所以，如果你看到什么东西让你非常非常生气，谁从中赚钱？如果你能识别出来，也许就不值得与之互动了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah, definitely.
Number one, step back.
Try and remember that the person
on the other end is also a
person.
That's something that I always
have to remind myself that
they're not necessarily doing
this with the intention of
hurting me.
They just aren't thinking about
me as a person.
They're thinking about me as
this, you know, empty canvas of
internet.
And also just remember who's
profiting off of what you are,
what makes you angry.
So if you see something and it
really, really upsets you, who
makes money off of that?
And if it's if you can identify
that, then maybe it's not worth
engaging with.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，Claire，非常感谢你的见解。非常感谢你。是的，也许我们会看……我的手机一直在听，所以我希望除了这个之外，我能看到很多猫的视频。非常感谢。非常感谢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right, Claire, really
appreciate your insights.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, let's maybe we'll
watch.
My phone's been listening, so
I'll get lots of cat videos I'm
hoping outside of this.
So appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 非常感谢你。祝你一天愉快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Thank you so much.
Have a good day.
