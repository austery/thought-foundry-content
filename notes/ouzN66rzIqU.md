### 市场V型反转的疯狂一日
今天真是疯狂的一天。感谢各位的到来，欢迎回到新一期的《收盘快评》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What a day, folks. What a day. Thank you everybody for being here. Welcome back to another episode of the market close.</p>
</details>

今天真是疯狂的一天。这真的是你能说的全部了，对吧？这周也同样疯狂。我们有很多事情要谈，有很多更新要跟进。但正如大家可能看到的那样，我们正在转绿，虽然不是完全变绿，但至少不像早上那么糟糕了。这基本上就是我们整个星期的状态，像坐过山车一样，但我们回来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What a day. That's really all you can say, right? What a freaking day. What a freaking week. There are a lot of things we have to talk about, a lot of updates we have to get into, but as everyone can likely see. We are going green, trying to not fully green, but we are at least not as bad as where we were in the morning. This is I think basically what we were doing the entire week. It's a little bit of a roller coaster ride, but we are back.</p>
</details>

那么，发生了什么？现在有几件事正在发生，这些事让我们很清楚地看到为什么市场会转绿。虽然不是完全变绿，但比特币的表现，我的天哪。同样，有很多事情需要剖析和讨论。比特币价格达到103.8，而早上我离开《开盘快评》时它还在99。标普500指数当时很低，现在是669，离转绿只差大约50美分。我们早上在标普500指数上大约是661。而现在你看到的是669。比特币当时大约在101、102的水平，所以比特币当时并未明确发出风险资产领域情况不妙的信号。但现在，它继续突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, what's going on? There's a couple of things that are happening right now. And the things that are happening are making it very apparent for why we are going green. Not fully going green, but Bitcoin. My goodness. Again, there's a lot of things to dissect and talk about. 103.8 on Bitcoin. It was at 99 in the morning when I left the market open. S&P was low. S&P right here 669. About 50 cents away from going green. we were at around 661 on the S&P. Um, and now you have 669. Bitcoin was kind of at like 101, 102, so Bitcoin was definitely not signaling that things were necessarily going bad in the risk on space. But, now it continues to break out.</p>
</details>

你看到一些股票当天仍然是红色的，但没有之前那么红了。Archer一度下跌17%，现在只跌了9%。Hims一度下跌5%，现在只跌了2%。SoFi正在转绿。MP Materials实际上涨了13%。在所有公司中，BitMine（BMNR）竟然成为当天表现最好的公司之一，上涨了8.3%。这是因为以太坊没有放缓脚步，正试图突破3500。Meta早上还在601，现在已经到了618，也试图转绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're seeing stocks that are still pretty red for the day, but they're not as red as they were. Archer was down 17, now it's down nine. Hims was down five, now it's down two. Soapfi going green. MP Materials actually up 13%. BitMine out of all companies, BMNR actually ends up being one of the best performers of the day, up 8.3%. That's because Ethereum is not slowing down. Ethereum right there trying to crush 3500. Meta was at 601 in the morning, now at 618 trying to go green.</p>
</details>

### 政府关门：市场波动的真正元凶？
到底发生了什么？我想我可能终于为我们本周所见的所有波动找到了一个答案，尤其是今天的波动。你知道，之前有关于劳动力市场的争论，有关于AI交易受到质疑的争论。我认为答案其实很简单，我将和大家分享我认为的答案。而且我认为，大约两小时前我们开始转绿的真正原因，就是因为这个：政府关门。民主党人试图让国会重新开门的某些想法，正让市场变得更加兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is going on? I think I finally have an answer potentially for all the volatility we've been seeing this week. Definitely the volatility we've been seeing today. You know, there were arguments about a labor market, arguments about the AI trade kind of getting into question. I think the answer is pretty simple, and I'm going to share with you guys what I think the answer is. And I think literally the reason we started going green about two hours ago, is because of this. It's the shutdown. Some ideas that the Democrats are trying to get Congress to reopen is what's getting the market to be a bit more excited.</p>
</details>

> Scott，我们刚刚看到查克·舒默和参议院民主党人在议会现场提出了一个全新的提议，基本上是告诉共和党人，他们愿意与共和党人一起投票让政府重新开门，只要共和党人能同意将**《平价医疗法案》**（Affordable Care Act, ACA: 通常被称为“奥巴马医改”，旨在扩大美国医疗保险覆盖范围的联邦法规）的税收抵免延长一年，这些抵免一直在帮助降低保费。民主党人还要求成立一个两党小组，共同研究共和党人曾表示希望看到的对这些税收抵免的一些改革。这里需要注意的是，参议院共和党人实际上已经表现出很大的开放态度，愿意寻找某种方式来延长这些税收抵免。他们确实希望有一些附加条件和限制，但总体上似乎是支持的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott, we just saw a brand new offer on the floor from Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, basically telling Republicans that they will vote with them to reopen the government as long as Republicans can agree with them to provide a one-year extension of those Affordable Care Act tax credits that have been keeping premiums low. Uh, Democrats are also asking that there's a bipartisan group that'll work together, figure out some of the reforms that Republicans have said they wanted to see on those tax credits. Important to note here, Senate Republicans have actually shown a lot of openness to finding some way to extend these tax credits. They do want some caveats, some limits on them, but they do overall seem to be supportive.</p>
</details>

当这个消息在一小时前出来时，你才真正看到了标普500指数的V型反转。我的意思是，我们确实在几个小时前就脱离了底部，但当这个头条新闻出来时，你才看到这个V型开始形成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When this came out an hour ago, that's when you really saw the the Vape on the S&P 500. I mean, we definitely got above the bottom a couple hours ago, but when this headline came out, that's where you saw this V starting to get formed.</p>
</details>

### 共和党的拒绝与持续的不确定性
然而，我们没有完全转绿的原因是，看起来共和党人将要拒绝民主党的提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the reason we're not fully green is because it looks like the rep Republicans are going to be uh rejecting the Democratic propos uh proposal.</p>
</details>

> 我从几位共和党助手那里听说，民主党人现在提出的这个提议——如果共和党人同意将《平价医疗法案》的税收抵免延长一年，他们就投票让政府重新开门——将不会被共和党人接受。我被告知这个提议实际上在几周前就已经提出过，并且被共和党人拒绝了。我们现在也看到了白宫就此发表的声明。一位白宫官员说，民主党人正在明确表示，他们为了其他开支而绑架了美国人民。这与他们最初的立场相比是一个巨大的让步，表明他们正承受着巨大的压力。他们接着说，民主党人今天就应该让政府重新开门，然后政府会与他们就税收抵免问题会面并进行协商。所以，说到底，共和党人还是坚持他们最初的立场，即他们对讨论这些医疗保健税收抵免持开放态度，但前提是民主党人先提供投票让政府重新开门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I am hearing uh from a couple of Republican aids that this offer now made by the Democrats that they will vote to reopen the government if Republicans provide a one-year extension of those Affordable Care Act tax credits is not going to be accepted by Republicans. I was told that this offer was actually made several weeks ago, that it was rejected by Republicans. We're also now seeing a statement come out from the White House on this. A White House official saying that Democrats are making clear they're holding the American people hostage for other spending. This is a huge climb down from their initial position shows they're under massive pressure. Um they go on to say that Democrats should reopen the government today and the administration then will meet with them on the tax credit and work on it. So going back really Republicans sticking with their initial position that they are open to talking about these healthc care tax credits but only after Democrats provide the votes to reopen the government.</p>
</details>

> 因此，如果这种情况继续下去，这个所谓的突破可能根本算不上什么突破，我们可能又回到了原点，双方都固守阵地。记住，特别是对民主党人来说，我知道有一些更温和的民主党人，他们想找到前进的道路，他们想让政府重新开门，但他们正受到来自中间派或更进步的民主党人的压力，这些人说：“看，我们周二刚刚取得了重大胜利。美国人民告诉我们，他们希望我们坚持下去，为医疗保健而战，我们需要这样做。”所以，我认为今天是否会有投票，投票内容是什么，以及政府关门会持续多久，都还没有确定。Scott。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if this kind of continues this breakthrough might not be much of one at all and we might be kind of back to where we were where both sides are really dug in firm. And remember for Democrats in particular I I am I do know that there are some more moderate Democrats out there. They want to find a way forward. They want to reopen the government, but they are getting pressure from maybe more centrist or more progressive Democrats who are saying, "Look, we just got big wins on Tuesday. The American people are telling us that they want us to hold out and really fight for healthcare and we need to do that." So, I think undetermined yet exactly if there's going to be a vote today, what that vote is going to be on, and how much longer the shutdown's going to go. Scott,</p>
</details>

我很高兴我们终于有了一些清晰度。我认为在整个星期，尤其是在今天早上，关于市场为何如此下跌存在很多困惑。当然，是的，这是健康的盘整之类的。但归根结底，人们想知道为什么英伟达会从205美元跌到170美元，对吧？英伟达占了标普500指数的8%。所以，一定有某个原因让市场感到不安。我认为今天，根据我们过去几个小时看到的价格走势，原因似乎就是这次政府关门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm just happy we finally have some clarity. I think throughout the entire week, definitely this morning, there was a lot of confusion on why is the market tumbling the way that it is. And obviously, yes, it's healthy, consolidation, all that stuff. But at the end of the day, people want some reason for why Nvidia goes from 205 to 170, right? Like there and it's Nvidia, it's 8% of the S&P 500. So, there has to be some reason that is getting the market to be upset. And I think today, based on the price action that we've seen over the past couple of hours, the reason it looks like is this government shutdown.</p>
</details>

当民主党提出延长ACA补贴一年的消息一出来——顺便说一句，这一直是我们无法让政府重新开门的关键症结所在——如果这真的发生，对Oscar来说是超级利好。Oscar，对吧，他们上涨了7%。许多其他医疗保健公司，比如Humana，也因此上涨。然后市场就转绿了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As soon as that news came out that Democrats are offering a one-year extension on ACA subsidies, which has been kind of the lynch pin of why we have not been able to reopen the government, by the way, super bullish for Oscar if that actually happens. Oscar, right, they're up 7%. A lot of the other healthcare companies like Humanana, um then then the markets went green.</p>
</details>

现在，大约20分钟前，共和党人非常明确地表示他们将拒绝那个提议。市场没有像之前预期的那样大幅转绿，但它们仍然收复了相当大一部分失地。标普500指数曾下跌超过1%，现在当天仅下跌0.02%。我认为谈判的信号是，也许这次谈判不会直接让政府开门，但它足以表明我们离政府开门越来越近了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, like 20 minutes ago, the Republicans pretty pretty much made it clear they're going to be rejecting that offer. Uh markets aren't going to super green like they seemed like they were on the trajectory to go, but they're still recovered a decent chunk. The S&P was down more than 1%. Now it's barely down 02%. On the day I think the signaling of the negotiations is that maybe this is not the exact negotiation that will open up uh the government pound you right there going green as well 17792. But it's enough to say that we're getting closer to the government opening up.</p>
</details>

### 波动根源：政治因素还是基本面？
嗯，这大概就是今天的故事了。这真的感觉像是今天的主线。现在，很多人可能会说，真的吗，政府关门是所有这些波动的唯一原因吗？再说一次，我不能确定这是唯一的原因，但根据价格走势和价格走势的变动来看，是的，这似乎是我们遭受一些痛苦的头号原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And well, that's that's I guess the story. I mean, that really feels like the story of the day. Now, a lot of people might be saying, really, the government shutdown was the reason for all this volatility. Again, I can't be sure that's the only thing, but based on the price action and based on the movement on the price action, yeah, it seems like that is the number one reason for why we've had some pain.</p>
</details>

所以，问题归结为，我们是否认为在未来几周内，民主党和共和党会就这个医疗保健问题达成某种程度的妥协——这再次成为我们至今未能开门的核心问题。Poly Market预测我们在11月16日之后开门的几率为50%。还是说这个问题会继续拖延下去？共和党人拒绝了这个提议，意味着他们不愿意将医疗保健补贴再延长一年。你知道，如果这是他们的特权，那就是他们的特权，但总有一天他们必须进行谈判，问题就变成了会是什么样的谈判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the it kind of comes down to do we think in the next few weeks, and Poly Market right here has a 50% odds that we will open after November 16. Do we believe in the next coming weeks we will get some level of capitulation from the Democrats and Republicans on this healthcare issue which again has been the core issue so far right there 28 for why we haven't opened or will this continue to be extended. The fact that the Republicans rejected this proposal means that they're not willing to extend healthcare subsidies for another year which you know if that's their prerogative that's the prerogative but at some point they're going to have to negotiate it and the question just becomes uh what will it be like?</p>
</details>

话虽如此，我认为这表明——我至少很高兴看到一些这样的价格走势的原因是——今天有很多关于这是否是基本面问题的讨论。AI交易是否出了问题？估值、企业债务等方面是否存在问题？我认为我们早上讨论的是，各公司的财报都非常好。现在像Open Door的财报不是最好的，但你知道，Open Door不是谷歌。谷歌的财报非常出色。Meta下跌是因为围绕**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure, Capex: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）以及他们是否能获得投资回报的各种问题，但Meta的收入仍然增长了26%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, I think it goes to show and and the reason I I I am at least happy to see some of this price action is that there was a lot of chatter today on is this fundamental, right? Is the AI trade messed up? Is there like an issue with valuations, corporate debt, all this stuff? And I think what we were talking about in the morning is that the earnings are really good across the board. The earning now like Open Door didn't have the best earnings, but you know, Open Door is not Google. Google had a phenomenal earnings. Meta is down because of a variety of things around capex spend and can they get an ROI but Meta still grew revenues at 26%.</p>
</details>

所以，从核心上说，因为估值不合理而认为这些股票需要下跌20-30%的说法，就像是，等一下，我们对估值做了很多研究，一些股票的市盈率确实很高，但地球上最重要的那些公司，它们的市盈率非常合理，你说的市盈率是23到30倍，而且它们的盈利还在增长。所以这感觉不像是一个基本面问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at its core to say these stocks need to be cut by 20 30% because their valuations don't make sense. It's like well wait a second we did a lot of work on valuations and some stocks do trade at aggressive multiples but the most important companies on the planet. They are trading at very reasonable multiples you know you're talking about 23 to 30 times earnings and they're growing earnings. So that's why it didn't feel like it was a fundamental issue.</p>
</details>

再说一次，基本面问题会演变成熊市，对吧？如果基本面出了问题，你最终会得到一个长期的抛售周期。如果只是像政府关门这样的头条新闻、宏观事件或新闻事件引起的震荡，那么也许我们不必承受那种痛苦。我认为现在判断到底是什么还为时过早，但根据我们今天看到的价格走势，可能就是因为政府关门，因为我们几乎收复了收盘前失去的所有失地。恐惧与贪婪指数最低时为14，现在基于这些关于政府关门的头条新闻，我们回到了20。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, a fundamental issue turns into a bare market, right? If the fundamentals are messed up, you end up getting a prolonged selling cycle. If it's just this jitter of a headline or a macro or a news event like the shutdown, then maybe we don't have to deal with that type of pain. I think it's too early to tell exactly what it is, but based on the price action we're seeing today, it might be because of the shutdown because again, we are almost recovering everything that we lost as we get into the close. Fear and greed was at 14 at its lowest. Now we're at 20 just based on these headlines around the shutdown.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，Meta的**市盈率**（Price-to-Earnings Ratio, PE: 衡量股价相对于每股收益的指标）为24倍，这不算泡沫。感觉不像泡沫。你可以理解为什么Meta股价被下调以及叙事上的压力，但这感觉不太像泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so yeah, Meta at a 24 PE is not a bubble. Like it didn't feel like a bubble. You could understand why Meta is getting chopped and the narrative overhang, but that doesn't feel much like a bubble.</p>
</details>

### 算法交易与市场情绪
我至少很高兴看到，鉴于标普指数在民主党提出医疗保健关门头条新闻后几乎完全逆转了当天的涨幅，这向我表明，这实际上是一场算法交易的游戏，它们把关门新闻作为涨跌的依据。这并不是对整个市场缺乏信心。我认为这对投资者来说是件好事，可以让他们有所依靠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">though. Uh I'm at least happy that it like given the fact that the S&P quite literally reversed most of the day's gains as soon as that Democrat healthcare shutdown headline came out. It it'd go to show me, oh, this is literally a game of alos that are toying with this shutdown headline news as the basis for how they're going to go up or down. It's not a lack of full belief in the broader market. And I think that's the positive thing for investors to kind of hang their hats on.</p>
</details>

现在，这会不会是一个牛市陷阱，周一我们……我不知道，我们拭目以待。但至少底部没有塌陷，而这基本上是今天开盘后头三个小时发生的事情。以太坊3400美元，比特币103.6。很多人在喊现在是山寨币周期。你看到很多这些老币，比如Fartcoin今天是领涨者之一，上涨了10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, is this a bit of a bull trap and Monday we get I mean, I don't know. we're going to see. But at least it's not the bottom falling out, which is pretty much what happened for the first three hours today during the market open. Ethereum right there 3,400, Bitcoin 103.6. A lot of people screaming that it is alt cycle now. You're seeing a lot of these old coins. I mean, Fartcoin being one of the leaders today, up 10%.</p>
</details>

如果现在是山寨币周期，那么BMR将会是受益者。以太坊也会受到一些青睐。BMR再次达到40.3。BMR一度跌至35.79。这只股票能有如此好的恢复，也让人感到欣慰。标普500指数，我们如此……哦，看，转绿了，670.3。这是市场在告诉你，我们认为政府关门很快就会结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If it is altcoin cycle, um fortcoin now is up on the day, yeah, almost 12 to 15%. If it is altcoin cycle, then BMR is going to be a beneficiary. Ethereum is going to get some love right there. BMR 40.3 again. BMR was at 3579. The fact that this one is making such a nice recovery is also nice to see. S&P 500 again, we are so Oh, there you go. Green 670.3 there. That's the market telling you we think the shutdown is going to end soon.</p>
</details>

即使共和党最终拒绝了那个提议，我认为市场基本上是在说，你知道吗，这次政府关门会结束，而且可能很快就会结束，这就是我们得到复苏的原因。我的意思是，如果你一整天都没看你的投资组合，你可能没注意到那种惨状，但如果你早上一直在跟踪，那确实是一片狼藉。而现在看来，很多惨状都是这次政府关门造成的，而它可能在下周重新开放。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even if the Republicans ended up rejecting that offer, I think that's the market basically saying, you know what, uh, this shutdown will come to an end and it probably will come to an end soon and that's why we're getting that recovery. I mean, if you didn't look at your portfolio the whole day, uh, notice the level of carnage, but if you were tracking it in the morning, there was some carnage. And a lot of that carnage seems to now be uh a result of this government shutdown that potentially might be reopening going into next week.</p>
</details>

### 收盘总结与个股表现
June说我们只是需要任何好消息。是的，我想是的。我猜市场关心的核心好消息就是这次政府关门。你知道，我们很多人早上都在说，劳动力市场可能是最大的问题。因为那是我们现在看到的更根本的情况。Grab仍然下跌1%，Celsius下跌7%。Palantir一度跌到16.8，现在是17.8。但劳动力市场可能继续是一个问题，至少在像今天这样的日子里，随着这些政府关门的头条新闻出来，也许那不是市场关心的核心问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">June says we just needed any good news. Yeah, I think so. And I guess the the core good news that the market cared about was this shutdown. And you know, the thing that I think a lot of us were saying in the morning was that hey, the labor market might be the biggest issue. Uh because you know, that is the more fundamental picture that we're seeing right now. Grab still down 1%, Celsius down 7%. Uh pounder got to 168 at one point. counter right now 178. But the labor market might continue to be an issue at least on a day like today as these shutdown headlines come through. Maybe that's not the core thing that the market cares about.</p>
</details>

这就是我们今天的情况。我的意思是，这并不是一个糟糕的周末收盘。我们还有大约四分钟市场就要关闭了。Matt先生早上以4.6美元的价格买入了一些Rocket Lab，我们现在是5.1美元，上涨了4%。我的意思是，几乎每只股票都出现了V型反转。这并不意味着每只股票都转绿了，但很多股票并没有停留在它们曾经的最低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's what we got. I mean, it's not a horrible close going into the end of the week. We got about four minutes until the market closes. Mr. Matt Money picked up some Rocket Lab this morning at 46. We were at 51. That's up 4%. I mean, pretty much every stock had a Vshape. That doesn't mean every stock went green, but like you have a lot of stocks that aren't really down at the very very lows that they were down for.</p>
</details>

即使是Micro Strategy也从219美元回升到240美元。你知道，英伟达，英伟达在低点时达到了177美元。现在英伟达是188美元，基本上要转绿了，或者说低点是178.92美元。现在是188美元，离转绿只差10美分。所以你看到，整个市场上的很多资产都在转绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even Micro Strategy was at 219, now it's at 240. You know, Nvidia, Nvidia got to 177 at the lows. Nvidia 188 basically going green or 178.92 on the lows. 188 right here, 10 cents away from going green. So, you're seeing across the board a lot of these assets go green.</p>
</details>

再说一次，这显示了算法交易如何能把某些东西推高，又如何能把它拉低。CoreWeave当天仍然下跌2.8%，一度跌至100美元，现在是103美元。Nebius一度跌至101美元，现在是111美元。还不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, you know, it goes to show how the alos will take something up and take something down. Cororee still down 2.8% of the day. At one point it was at 100. Now it's at 103. Nebius was at 101. Now it's at 111. Not too bad.</p>
</details>

Burry的空头仓位怎么样了？我不知道。但做空市场上两只最大的AI股票——Palantir和英伟达——是一场危险的游戏，而且它们的下跌并非因为与AI相关的事情。我想再次明确这一点，我不认为英伟达和Palantir今天的下跌是因为与AI相关的事情，而这正是我认为Burry在等待的，他等着这个AI泡沫破裂，然后英伟达和Palantir被摧毁，他就能赚几十亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happened to Bur shorts? I mean, I don't know. But it is a dangerous game being short, the two biggest AI stocks in the market, Pounder and Nvidia, and having them go down not because of something AI. Again, I want to make this very clear. I don't think Nvidia and Pounder took a hit today because of something AI related, which is what I think Bur's waiting for. this like AI bubble to pop and then Nvidia and Palanteer end up getting wrecked and he makes billions of dollars.</p>
</details>

下跌是因为政府关门。在我们收盘时感觉就是这样。就像所有东西，不仅仅是英伟达和Palantir。这两家公司受到的打击更重一些。但这是因为政府关门的事情，现在它们都在相当程度上恢复了，这意味着如果他早上平掉了空头仓位，他可能赚了一些利润。但我认为他做空不是为了让股价从200美元跌到170美元，我认为他是为了让它从200美元跌到100美元。至少Burry通常是这么做的。也许这次他有不同的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was because of a shutdown. Like that's what it feels like as we get into the it was like everything, not just Nvidia and Palanteer. Those guys were taking it a bit harder on the chin. But it was because of this shutdown stuff and now they're both recovering a decent amount which means maybe if he closed the shorts in the morning, he made some profit. But again, I don't think he's shorting it for it to go from 200 to 170. I think he's shorting it to go from 200 to 100. At least that's how Bur has typically done things. Maybe this time he's thinking of it in a different way.</p>
</details>

但是，要想让Palantir或英伟达真正崩盘，我认为你需要一个市场崩盘。我不认为这两只个股，鉴于它们极高的流动性，围绕它们交易的大量期权，以及它们最终的基本面增长故事，如果市场不下跌，它们会轻易下跌。所以Burry实际上是在赌整个市场。这不仅仅是Palantir和英伟达。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I mean to get Palenter to really collapse or Nvidia to really collapse, I think you need a market collapse. I don't think those two individual names, given how highly liquid they are, how many options are traded around them, and ultimately their fundamental growth stories, I don't think they easily just go down if the market doesn't go down. So Bur's kind of making a bet on the entire market, dude. It's not really Palanteer and Nvidia.</p>
</details>

你知道，如果这是两只像核能领域那样被过度炒作的随机AI股票，我能理解专门做空它们。但Palantir和英伟达是市场的核心组成部分。即使在今天的期权交易市场，交易量排名前20的股票中，前三名是什么？英伟达交易了400万份合约，特斯拉交易了350万份合约，然后是Palantir，今天交易了120万份合约。这些都是股市中的家喻户晓的名字。

<p class="english-text">You know, if they were this these were two two random AI stocks that were super hyped like in the nuclear space, I could understand shorting them specifically. But pounder and video are core core parts of the market. I mean, even in the options trading market today, the top 20 stocks that were traded, what are the top three? Nvidia with four million contracts traded, Tesla with 3.5 million contracts traded, and then Palunteer with 1.2 million contracts traded today. These are household names in the stock market.</p>
</details>

然后是AMD、Meta、苹果、IBIT、Open Door、Micro Strategy、亚马逊、Robinhood、SoFi、SoundHound、IREN、谷歌、Coinbase、英特尔、Archer、微软和Marathon。要想让这些股票下跌，我认为他真的认为整个市场要么必须崩盘，要么必须遭受重创。而至少我们今天收盘时看到的情况是，这次政府关门的消息可能足以避免这种情况。

<p class="english-text">Then you have AMD, Meta, Apple, IBIT, Open Door, Micro Strategy, Amazon Hood, SoFi, Sound, I Ren, Google, Coinbase, Intel, Archer, Microsoft, and Meta or uh or I should say Marathon. Like for those names to go red, I think he really does think the entire market has to either collapse or take a really big hit. And at least what we're seeing as we get into the close today for Friday is this government shutdown news might be enough to potentially avoid that.</p>

### OpenAI的新闻与市场反应
我们这里有一条关于OpenAI的头条新闻。OpenAI要求美国将《芯片法案》的税收抵免扩大到数据中心。哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have a headline right here on OpenAI. Open AAI asks the US to expand chips act tax credit to data centers. Wow.</p>
</details>

我的天。彭博社报道，OpenAI要求美国扩大《芯片法案》的税收抵免。这个《芯片法案》是拜登担任总统时推出的，现在要求扩大到数据中心。这家伙不是刚说我们不希望政府为任何……我以为他……我的意思是，这不完全是给……好吧，这是税收抵免，不是贷款，但它绝对是一种补贴，这是肯定的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Holy crap. Bloomberg. Uh, OpenAI asks the United States to expand Chips Act tax credit. The Chips Act is from when Biden was president to data centers. Didn't this guy just say we don't want the government to backs stop any of the I thought he I mean this is not really a loan to an well it's a tax credit right it's not a loan but it definitely is a subsidy that's for sure</p>
</details>

是的，就是这样。彭博社刚刚，就在三分钟前报道，OpenAI要求美国将芯片税收抵免扩大到数据中心。这可能就是为什么首席财务官会口误说出整个政府支持的事情，她后来为此道歉了。我的意思是，她之所以这么说，是因为他们可能知道他们正准备提出请求，并且必须正式公布出来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">yeah there you go Bloomberg just now literally three minutes ago openai asks the US to expand chips tax credit to data centers that's probably why the CFO slipped up and said this whole government backs stop thing which she apologized for I mean the reason she said it is because They probably knew they were getting ready to make a request and they had to officially get it out there.</p>

### 专家视角：AI焦虑与长期趋势
> 教授，感谢您对当前新闻的迅速反应，我们看到它显然正在影响市场的交易方式。在本周还剩不到一个小时的时候，我想把您的注意力引向我认为本周真正的主题，那就是对AI交易的焦虑。我想知道您对此有何看法。纳斯达克指数虽然已经从最低点回升，但本周仍然下跌了超过3%，许多与AI相关的大型股票本周显然也经历了剧烈波动。您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Professor, I appreciate you reacting so quickly to the news of this moment as we see it obviously impacting how this market is trading. With less than an hour to go in the week, I want to steer you though to what I think has really been the story of this week and that is anxiety over this AI trade. I'm wondering what you make of it. The fact the NASDAQ has certainly come off its worst levels, but it's still down more than 3% on the week and many of these big AI related stocks have obviously been extraordinarily volatile this week. What do you make of it?</p>
</details>

> 嗯，你知道，两周前，在那两周里，它们飙升了。相对于市场，我经常绘制科技股相对于市场的图表，它就像是冲上去又跌下来。现在它又回到了趋势线上。而趋势线仍然是，这些股票在过去六个月、过去一年、两年后，相对于市场的其他部分仍在上涨。你知道，这种趋势当然不可能永远持续下去。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, you know, uh, two weeks ago, for those two weeks, they shot up and and I relative to the market, I I often, uh, chart, uh, the the the tech stocks relative to the market, it was sort of, uh, shooting up and shooting back down. And now it's right back at the trend line. And the trend line is still that these stocks over the last six months, over the last year, after two years, are still moving up relative to the next uh to the rest of the market. Uh, you know, that trend certainly can't continue forever.</p>
</details>

> 不过，Scott，我认为每当有人说这是末日的开始，当每个人都开始说这是末日的开始时，我就开始说，“嘿，不，事情不是这样的。”通常是当每个人都完全乐观时，你才会看到市场开始崩溃。所以我仍然认为AI交易还在继续。我的意思是，我听到了反对它的论点。你知道，Meta因为其所有的资本支出而面临特殊问题，而且确实如此，因为我为那些进行过多资本支出的公司做过研究，它们在市场上的表现几十年来一直不佳，我们会把Meta归入这一类。但其余的公司正在用那些支出来创造利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, what what I think though, Scott, whenever anyone says it's the beginning of the end, and when everyone starts saying it's the beginning of the end, I begin to say, "Hey, no, that's not the way it works." Well, it's usually when when everyone is totally optimistic that you see the market begin to crumble. So, I I still think the AI trade is on. I mean, I hear the arguments against it. uh you know Meta is having particular problems because of all its uh you know capital expenditures and uh you know it it is true because I've done the research for firms that do a too much capital uh spending actually have underperformed over decades in the market and we will put a meta in that category but the rest of them uh are generating those profits with that expenditures</p>

### 政治动态持续影响市场
特朗普刚刚表示，美国参议院在达成结束民主党政府关门的协议之前不应离开。好吧，所以至少特朗普是站在达成协议这一边的。他刚刚发推文说：“美国参议院在达成结束民主党政府关门的协议之前不应离开。如果他们无法达成协议，共和党人应立即终止**冗长辩论**（Filibuster: 美国参议院的一种议事程序，少数派议员可通过发表超长演说等方式阻挠议案通过）并照顾好我们伟大的美国工人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump just now says the United States Senate should not leave town until they have a deal to to end the Democrat shutdown. Okay, so at least Trump is on the side of getting a deal. He just tweeted, "The United States Senate should not leave town until they have a deal to end the Democrat shutdown. If they can't reach a deal, the Republicans should terminate the filibuster immediately and take care of our great American workers."</p>
</details>

标普指数在盘后上涨，可能就是因为特朗普的这条推文，因为这条推文表明他非常希望达成协议，如果他真的希望达成协议，那么共和党人可能真的会努力寻找达成协议的方法。当然，我不确定特朗普是否同意延长一年的ACA补贴。

<details>

</details>

我不知道，因为迈克·约翰逊和特朗普在过去40天里一直在抱怨，我们不能让民主党人为了将这些医疗保健补贴扩大到非法移民而让政府开门。但如果这是他们完成任务的唯一方式，那我也不知道。这是特朗普今天早上在椭圆形办公室谈论政府关门时说的话。

<p class="english-text">I don't know because Mike Johnson's been complaining for the past 40 days along with Trump that we cannot let the Democrats open up the government for these healthcare subsidies to be extended to illegal immigrants.

</details>

> 我们现在政府关门了，你可能知道，因为民主党人疯了。他们疯了，但他们不在乎是否伤害国家。但我们已经批准了14次，我们已经批准了14次重新开门，但他们一直拒绝。我猜他们可能还会再次拒绝。让我们看看会发生什么。他们想让很多坏事发生，对我们国家不好的事。我们不会给那些非法进入我们国家的人1.5万亿美元。我们不会这么做。给那些来自监狱、来自精神病院的人，他们是毒贩。他们想给他们医疗保健。我们政府关门是因为……

### 劳动力市场的警示信号
> 市场最关注的是真正驱动盈利和整体市场动力的因素，这就回到了我们之前讨论的AI泡沫辩论。在这一点上，我认为Jeremy的一个评论非常关键，那就是如果你害怕泡沫，你会希望看到我们现在看到的这种行动，我们都在辩论资本支出的质量，我们动用债务市场的程度。我认为我们需要继续观察这种活动，但也要与我们上一次真正经历泡沫时相比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> On consumer sentiment today, um, and also a small impact on consumer spending as well. But, you know, markets are most focused on what's really driving earnings and overall market momentum right now, which goes back to the AI bubble debate that we were talking about earlier. And on that point, I think one of Jeremy's comments was was really key where um if you were afraid of a bubble, I mean, you would want to see the kind of action that we're seeing right now where we're all debating the quality of capex, how much we're tapping debt markets. And I think we need to continue to watch this activity, but also</p>
</details>

> 大部分支出都是通过杠杆融资的，而且都是些 scrappy 的初创公司。所以我认为现实是，仍然有非常强大、稳固的现有公司在推动这波AI浪潮。AI浪潮正在扩展到基本面较差的公司，我们需要保持谨慎，但投资者也需要有长远的眼光，或许要熬过一些本周内的波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">relative to the last time we actually had a bubble, most of that spending was all leverage financed and they were all scrappy startup companies. And so I think the reality is there are still really powerful strong incumbents powering this AI wave. The AI wave is broadening out to companies with inferior fundamentals and we need to be cautious but investors need to also have a long-term perspective um and maybe write out some of this intra week.</p>
</details>

> 这里的估值绝对是关键。我认为挑战在于，我们投资AI是为了那些仍处于萌芽阶段的商业模式。我们不知道它们背后的定价机制。我们不知道最终用户需求会是怎样。例如，ChatGPT只将大约5%的用户转化为付费订阅者。所以，鉴于你在指数曲线上有支出，这种不确定性是合理的。计算成本和计算需求都在指数曲线上，是需求而不是成本。我认为这一切都值得谨慎，但我们看到的是真正战略性的长期规划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Valuations are absolutely key here. And I think the challenge is we're investing for AI for business models that are still so nent. We don't know the pricing mechanisms behind them all. We don't know what the end user demand is going to be. Chat GBT for instance only converts about 5% of its users into paid subscribers. So the uncertainty is warranted given that you have spending on this exponential curve. Compute costs and compute needs are on an exponential curve. Needs not costs. Um, and I think that all warrants caution, but what we're seeing is really strategic long-term planning.</p>
</details>

### 市场情绪的摇摆与投资者的抉择
这就是为什么今天早上AI交易受到质疑有点奇怪，对吧？因为所有大型科技公司都给出了总计约4500亿到5000亿美元的资本支出指引。这还只是七巨头。当你把所有其他公司都算进去，到2026年，这个数字接近6000亿美元。这是巨大的资本支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, see, this is this is the reason why the AI trade coming into question this morning was a bit weird, right? Because all of the big tech companies guided for cumulatively, if you put it together, it's around 450 to 500 billion of capex spending. And that's just the max 7. When you have all the other companies that you put into the mix, you get closer to 600 billion for 2026. That's a lot of capex.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，他们上周就这么说了，市场消化了，理解了，并能够将其计入价格，这就是为什么你看到标普500指数达到690点。然后今天，你看到每个人，或者至少感觉是每个人，都在质疑所有这些支出的状况，就好像谷歌没有说过他们将在2026年花费930亿美元一样。所以这就像市场来回摇摆，试图问自己，我们真的相信这些支出是合理的吗？我们相信这些支出是值得的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they said that last week, the market digested it, understood it, was able to kind of price it in, and that's where you saw the S&P 500 kind of get to 690. And then today you have everyone or at least what it felt like is everyone questioning the state of all that spend as if Google didn't say they were going to spend $93 billion in 2026. And so it's kind of this like back and forth of the market trying to ask themselves, do we actually believe this spend is justified and do we believe the spend is worth it?</p>
</details>

对于Meta，他们显然认为这笔支出不值得。这就是为什么Meta的股价暴跌。但其他公司相对还好。所以我觉得，作为投资者，你必须在这里做出主观决定。你是否相信AI资本支出、AI支出的故事不会放缓？不管债券市场如何参与，不管对Meta将用所有这些资本支出建造什么缺乏了解，你仍然信任并相信它，因为如果你不信，你知道，这就是我认为本周一直存在的市场紧张情绪。如果你相信，那么你就逢低买入，因为你不在乎，因为你知道最终会有回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for Meta, they obviously do not think the spend is worth it. That's why Meta's got wrecked. But the other names have been relatively okay. So I feel like this is where you have to make a subjective decision as an investor. Do you believe that the AI capex AI spend story is not slowing down? Regardless of the uh bond markets that are getting involved, regardless of the lack of awareness of like what Meta is going to build with all this capex, you still trust and believe in it because if you don't, you know, that is kind of the market jitter that I think has been around all week. If you do, then you buy the dip because you don't care because you know that inevitably there is going to be return there.</p>

### 企业债务与估值压力
看看CoreWeave的**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swaps, CDS: 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者对冲信用风险或对特定公司的信用质量进行投机），这与他们的债券市场有关。看那个，推高到500。基本上，随着这些互换的买卖价差持续走高，意味着市场希望为他们承担的债务获得更高的回报。这也与甲骨文类似。今天早上，这些也开始走高。部分原因是市场对这些公司承担的债务类型有些担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is their credit default swaps for Cororeweave. which is tied to the bond uh market for them. Look at that. Pushing 500. And basically, as these swaps, as the bid spreads on the swaps continue to go higher, that means the market wants more of a return for the debt that they're taking on. This is this is similar to Oracle as well. Those started going higher this morning as well. And part of the reason for that is because the market is a bit, you know, concerned about the uh the type of debt that these companies are taking on.</p>
</details>

你知道，CoreWeave的债务股本比是318%，这有点激进。所以你看到债券市场开始将这些东西定价得更高。我认为这就是为什么甲骨文的股票今天下跌了2%，跌至自9月以来的最低水平。它实际上跌到了232美元，这正是它在9月份的位置，就在它飙升到350美元之前。所以任何在那之后买入的人，现在都在这些股票上亏损，因为市场试图弄清楚到底该如何处理这些企业债务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, Cororeweave has a 318% debt to equity ratio, which is a bit aggressive. So, you're seeing the bond market start to price these things a bit higher. And I think that's why Oracle stock was down today, 2% down to basically the worst levels it's been since September. It actually got to 232, which is exactly where it was in September, right before it ran to 350. So, anyone who bought after that is kind of down on these shares right here as the market tries to figure out exactly what to do with that corporate debt.</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I also think there was a big buying opportunity. Yeah, that that seems to be the number one reason.

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because they need the data to come out to force the Fed's hand to cut. They cannot have the Fed not cut in December. And if we don't get job, if we don't get unemployment reports, if we don't get other key indicators, that could put them in a situation we got to wait for the data to be data dependent.</p>
</details>

> Sam: 我昨晚发了一条推文说，嘿，看，有些新闻被忽略了，参议院将在本周末投票结束政府关门。我想它说的是今天或者这个周末。我不确定是哪个，但看看移动平均线，它在标普指数上支撑着50日移动平均线，再看看其他东西的技术指标，以及加密货币的强势，似乎我们不会进一步下跌。所以我决定逆转我今天早上的趋势。而且，我实际上在39.50美元左右又回购了BMR。

<details>

I think it said it was supposed to be today or this weekend. I don't know which one, but um just looking at the moving average, the fact that it was supporting the 50-day moving average on SPY and looking at the technicals for other things and crypto being strong, it didn't necessarily seem like we're going to start plummeting further downward. So, I made the decision to basically reverse the trends that I had done this morning. And uh I actually also got back into BMR at like 3950.</p>
</details>

> Steve: 我认为Palantir会在这点上在150到200之间交易。我说过它会横盘一段时间，直到它的估值得以消化。事实是，他们在周一财报当天并没有大涨。所以，他们在发布了最令人难以置信的财报后，却无法突破历史高点，这对我来说意味着短期顶部或中期顶部已经形成。现在的问题是，在一切发生的同时，它会在哪个区间交易？我认为是在150到200之间，因为基本面太好了。这是我对他们收入和自由现金流的预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look, I do believe that Palanteer is going to trade between 150 and 200 at this point. I said that it's going to trade sideways for a while while it grows into the valuation. The fact that they couldn't blow out because remember the big sell-off didn't happen the day of earnings on Monday. So the fact that they the fact that they couldn't blow through all-time highs on the most incredible earnings report that they did to me says that a short-term top is in or a midterm top is at. Now it the question is what range does it trade at while everything happens? I think it's between 150 and 200 because the fundamentals are so good. And this is my projection for their revenue and free cash flow.</p>
</details>

> 我认为我的预测非常准确。现在，时间会证明一切，但如果你去Seeking Alpha看看收入预测，仅有的两个愿意公布预测的华尔街分析师，他们的数字略高于我的，我认为是2030年的206亿美元。当你考虑到这一点时，这是一个非常非常大的数字。然后你再考虑2030年之后。我真的相信Palantir会成为一家万亿美元的公司，这意味着从现在起有1120%的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that I'm pretty spot on. Now, look, time will tell, but if you go to the Seeking Alpha and you look at the revenue projections, the only two analysts that are willing to put projections out from the street are just over my number at I think 20.6 billion for 2030. I mean, that's a that's a big big number when you think about this. And then you think about going forward past 2030. I truly believe Palanteer is going to be a trillion dollar company which is what 1 point 120% return from here.</p>
</details>

> Sam: 至于IREN的财报，其实还不错。就这次特定的财报而言，我认为财务数据并不重要。他们几乎所有的收入都来自比特币，对吧？所以他们只有大约700万美元的AI云收入，但这在某种程度上是预料之中的，因为他们仍在建设AI云并进行转型。所以Twitter上对此有很多负面看法，比如，哦看，这就是他们云业务的全部收入。嗯，是的，因为他们将要完成建设。但现在他们预测，到明年年底，年化收入将达到约34亿美元。其中很大一部分是与微软合作的。微软的年化收入是19亿美元。所以我认为这非常令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, it's all it's all good. It's all good. Um, so the earnings were actually good. Like when it comes to this particular earnings, I don't think the financials really matter. Like almost all of their revenue is from Bitcoin, right? So they only had like $7 million in AI cloud, but that's kind of expected because they're still building out the AI cloud and making the pivot. So there was like a lot of negative connotation with that on Twitter where it was like, oh look, this is all they making cloud. Well, yeah, because they're going to be wrapping it up. But then now they're projecting, I think it was about $3.4 billion AR by the end of next year. And a lot of that is with Microsoft. Microsoft is $1.9 billion ARR. So I thought that was very surprising.</p>

> Steve: 至于未来10年的七巨头，我的选择是亚马逊。一直都是。亚马逊将永远是世界顶级公司之一。他们的护城河是惊人的。电子商务仍在增长，即使在新兴市场也是如此。你甚至可以看到MercadoLibre，我认为MercadoLibre今天也是一个很好的买入机会。电子商务前景广阔。他们是世界上最大的超大规模云服务商。他们很可能在明年开始重新加速。我只是觉得它会一直存在。它会一直存在。

> 我会选择特斯拉。亚马逊和谷歌更理性，百分之百。如果我纯粹理性，那会是亚马逊、谷歌，很容易。但就上行潜力而言，我认为是特斯拉。我认为是机器人，是自动驾驶。我想说英伟达，但在某个时候，你知道，芯片停止销售，所以英伟达无法保持他们曾经的增长速度。特斯拉已经好几年没有增长了。所以特斯拉最终在未来，也许两到……我们说的是10年，对吧？所以到2036年，大约在2029年左右，即使需要三年才能回到那个S型增长曲线。我认为这会发生，如果不是更早的话。我知道和埃隆在一起是一段颠簸的旅程，但他有动力去赚一万亿美元。

<p class="english-text">I'm going with Tesla, dude. I'm going with Tessie. I Amazon and Google are more rational. 100,000%. And if I was pure rationally, it would be like Amazon, Google easily. But in terms of upside potential, I think it's Tessy. I think it's the robots. I think it's self-driving. Uh I I I I I want to say Nvidia, but at some point, you know, the chips stop getting sold and so Nvidia can't be putting up the types of growth they were putting up. I don't Tesla hasn't been growing for a couple years. So Tesla's eventually in the next maybe two to we're talking about 10 years, right? So 2036 by around 2029ish, even if it takes three years to get back to that scurve of growth. I think that happens if not sooner. And I know it's a a bumpy ride with Elon, but he's incentivized to make a trillion dollars.</p>
