### 真实间谍的画像：消失在人群中的“灰人”

大众对间谍的印象往往源于影视作品，例如詹姆斯·邦德系列。然而，前中央情报局特工安德鲁·巴斯塔门特指出，这种刻板印象与现实相去甚远。真实的间谍更需要的是融入环境的能力，而非外貌出众、身手不凡。他们不追求引人注目，而是努力让自己不被察觉，成为人群中不起眼的存在，即所谓的“灰人”（gray man）。这种低调的特质，使得他们能够在各种环境中自由行动，而不引起怀疑。中央情报局、军情六处和摩萨德等情报机构在招募特工时，尤其看重那些能够轻易消失在人群中的人，他们可能年轻或年老，体格健壮或普通，拥有不同的宗教信仰和穿着习惯。但最理想的类型是“棕色但不深，瘦弱但不消瘦，中年”的人，因为他们无论身处亚洲、拉丁美洲、加拿大还是澳大利亚，都容易被忽视，不会留下深刻的印象。

- One of the most famous spy series 
of all time actually gets it wrong,  
and that's the James Bond series. He's always 
attractive. He's always well-spoken. He's  
always an amazing driver, an amazing fighter, 
an amazing shot. He's great with the women,  
and somehow, he's able to operate all over 
the world by calling himself by his true name.
- The name's Bond, James Bond.
- James Bond. This is not what espionage is like. 
Real espionage is about people who blend in,  
people who aren't attractive, people who don't get 
a second look, people who are terrible with women,  
people who never drive a fancy car, people 
who never have to pull out their gun because  
they're so good at keeping a secret, 
they can get in and get out without  
ever even being noticed in the first 
place. My name is Andrew Bustamante,  
and I'm a former covert CIA intelligence 
officer and the founder of EverydaySpy.com.

### 间谍的内在素质：适应性与资源力

优秀的间谍并非天生具备所有技能，而是拥有一些内在的素质，例如快速思考、创造力、适应性、坚韧性和资源力。更重要的是，他们不渴望成为众人瞩目的焦点，而是享受匿名带来的舒适感。这种对匿名的重视，为情报机构提供了培养间谍的沃土。情报机构可以教授他们各种技能，包括黑客技术、情报收集技巧、伪装术和外语，并相信这些技能不会被滥用或炫耀，而是用于进一步提升自身的隐蔽性。巴斯塔门特自嘲自己并非优秀的学霸或士兵，正是这种不引人注目的特质，让他意外地被中央情报局招募。

The public really doesn't realize that they 
are much closer to CIA spies than they think  
they are. International espionage requires a wide 
range of different types of look and appearance.  
There's a place for the very young and the very 
old. There's a place for the very fit and the  
very unfit. There's a place for tall people, 
short people. There's even room for people who  
have different religious beliefs that require 
them to wear different types of physical dress.  
But when it comes to the one type of person 
that has the most operational utility,  
you're looking for somebody who is brown but not 
too dark; somebody who is thin but not too thin;  
somebody who is middle-aged; because that's 
exactly the kind of person that disappears no  
matter where they go. Whether they're in Asia 
or Latin America, whether they're in Canada or  
Australia, they're overlooked. They're not the 
kind of person you remember bumping into when  
you're standing in line at a local coffee 
shop. And that's exactly the kind of "gray  
man" that CIA, MI6, and Mossad really look 
for when they develop a new high-performance  
field operative. A good covert operator is 
born with a certain series of skills. They  
are very good at thinking on their feet. They're 
creative, they're adaptable, they're resilient,  
and resourceful. They're also able to blend in and 
disappear. These are not people who want to be the  
center of attention. They're the wallflowers at 
your school prom. They're the kids who sit in  
the second-to-last row because if they sat in the 
last row of the school bus, they would be noticed.

### 中央情报局的招募与培训：三步曲

中央情报局的培训模式独树一帜，遵循“教育、演练、体验”的三步曲。首先，学员在课堂上接受教育，学习各种技能和概念。随后，他们通过角色扮演等方式进行演练。最后，他们被派往真实环境中实践所学，并在实践中检验自己的能力。这种“独立操作，自我评估”的模式，有助于培养学员的责任感和自信心，使其能够在单兵作战时保持冷静和高效。中央情报局对培训投入巨大，因为他们不希望为学员提供心理治疗，而是寻找那些能够承受巨大压力、在困境中保持冷静的人。

The people who turn into very good spies are the 
people who enjoy the comfort of anonymity. Now,  
when an intelligence service gets ahold of this 
person who values anonymity, then they have this  
rich, fertile soil to teach them a whole slew of 
skills, from hacking skills to tradecraft skills,  
to disguise, to foreign language, and they can put 
and invest these skills into somebody knowing that  
that person will never show off or brag about 
their skills. Instead, they're gonna use those  
advanced skills to make themselves even more 
invisible in front of everybody else. I often  
joke that I was the accidental recruit to CIA 
because I was not a great high school student.  
I was not a great college student. I came from 
the military, but I was not a good soldier. I was  
leaving the U.S. Air Force and trying to find 
a job that was the exact opposite of working  
for the Air Force because, as an Air Force 
officer, I was in command of nuclear missiles,  
knowing that if I turned my key, I would end human 
life in some place. So when the time came for me  
to leave the Air Force, I wanted to do something 
that was the polar opposite of nuclear missiles,  
so I found myself applying to the U.S. Peace 
Corps. And in the middle of my application to  
Peace Corps, I actually had a screen pop up on 
my computer that said, based on my answers to  
date in my application, I might qualify for other 
jobs in the national security sector. Would I be  
willing to put my application on pause? And like 
any other 27-year-old, when I heard that there  
might be an opportunity for me to do something 
else, I hit yes. And I said, "Yes, I am willing  
to put my application on hold for 72 hours to see 
what comes of this." And that's when I got a phone  
call one day later from a woman who didn't tell 
me her last name and came from an unlisted phone  
number with a 703 area code, which is Langley, 
Virginia. And she invited me to Washington, D.C.,  
to go through an application process that would 
vet me for a possible role in national security. I  
didn't know at the time that I was being vetted 
for CIA. I got a set of plane tickets in the  
mail. I had a rental car sent to me. I was only 
given enough information to make it another day:  
where my next hotel would be, where my next 
appointment would be. And that's kind of how I was  
carried along for the better part of 10 months as 
I went through test after test and interview after  
interview where I was applying for and escalating 
through the process of becoming a CIA operative.
