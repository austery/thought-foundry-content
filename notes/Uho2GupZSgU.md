### 欧洲的“领导力”：制定规则而非引领创新

欧洲人对这些事情的心态确实很不一样。当他们谈论 AI 领导力时，他们指的是在制定法规方面取得领先。他们在布鲁塞尔开会，商讨所有规则应该是什么样的。这就是他们所谓的领导力。

<p class="english-text">The Europeans, I mean, they have a really different mindset for all this stuff. When they talk about AI leadership, what they mean is that they're taking the lead in defining the regulations. You know, they get together in Brussels and figure out what all the rules should be. And that's what they call leadership.</p>
</details>

>> 这几乎就像一个游戏节目。他们想尽一切办法把初创公司扼杀在摇篮里，然后如果这些小公司能熬过长达十年的虐待，他们才会给钱让它们发展。

<p class="english-text">It's almost like a game show or something. They do everything they can to strangle them in their crib and then if they make it through like a decade of abuse of small companies, then they're going to give them the money to grow.</p>

>> 罗纳德·里根对此有一句名言：如果它在动，就给它征税；如果它还在动，就监管它；如果它不动了，就补贴它。

### AI 与加密货币：特朗普政府的不同监管策略

>> David，欢迎来到 a16z 播客。感谢你的加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">David, welcome to the a16z podcast. Thanks for joining.</p>
</details>

>> 很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, good to be here.</p>
</details>

>> David，你是 AI 和加密货币领域的负责人。你为什么不先谈谈，将这两个领域放在一个组合里为什么是合理的？它们之间有什么关联？然后请你阐述一下特朗普在在两个领域的计划是什么，以及我们做得怎么样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, David, you're the AI and crypto czar. Why don't you first talk about why it makes sense to have those as a portfolio? What do they have to do with each other? And then I'll have you lay out what's the Trump plan on those two categories and how we're doing.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，这两项技术都相对较新。因此，人们对它们有很多恐惧，而且我认为大家对它们的了解其实并不多，不知道该如何看待它们。从政策角度来看，我认为处理方式有些不同，我们可以谈谈其中的异同。

对于加密货币，我认为最需要的是监管的确定性。多年来，我接触过的所有企业家都说同样的话，那就是“告诉我们规则是什么”。我们很乐意遵守，但华盛顿方面就是不告诉我们规则。事实上，在拜登执政期间，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的主席采取了一种被称为“通过执法进行监管”的方式，这基本上意味着你只会被起诉。他们不告诉你规则是什么，你基本上就是被起诉，然后其他人应该从你被起诉、罚款和监禁的过程中去揣摩规则。

这就是过去几年的做法。结果，整个加密行业都在向海外转移，我认为美国正在被剥夺这个未来的产业。因此，特朗普总统在竞选期间，去年在纳什维尔发表了一次现在很著名的演讲，他宣称要让美国成为全球的加密货币之都，并且他会解雇 Gensler（时任 SEC 主席）。这句是当时掌声最热烈的一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there are two technologies that I guess are relatively new. And so there's a lot of fear of them and I think people don't actually know that much about them. They don't really know what to make of them. I think that from a policy standpoint and we can talk about the similarities and differences. The approaches are a little different.

I think with crypto, the main thing that's needed is regulatory certainty. You know, all the entrepreneurs I've talked to over the years, they all say the same thing, which is just tell us what the rules are. We're happy to comply, but Washington won't tell us what they are. And in fact, during the Biden years, you had an SEC chairman who took an approach, which I guess has been called regulation through enforcement, which basically means you just get prosecuted. They don't tell you what the rules are. You just basically get indicted and then everyone else is supposed to divine what the rules are as you get prosecuted and fined and imprisoned.

So, that was the approach for several years. And as a result of that, basically the whole crypto industry was in the process of moving offshore and America I think was being deprived of this industry of the future. And so President Trump during his campaign and last year he gave a now famous speech in Nashville in which he declared that he would make the United States the crypto capital of the planet and that he would fire Gensler. That was like the big applause line.</p>
</details>

>> 他后来谈到，他自己都惊讶于那句话获得了如此热烈的掌声。所以他又说了一遍，人群再次沸腾。但无论如何，他承诺会提供这种清晰度，以便行业能够理解规则并遵守，这反过来也应该为消费者、企业以及生态系统中的每个人提供更大的保护，并使美国更具竞争力。所以我认为，在加密货币方面的任务，在某种程度上是支持监管的。我们基本上是希望建立规则。

而 AI 在某种程度上恰恰相反，我认为拜登政府的做法过于严厉。他们甚至在不了解这个领域的情况下就开始对其进行严格监管。他们没有花时间去了解 AI 是如何被使用的，真正的危险是什么。当时存在着强烈的恐惧散播。结果，拜登政府的做法是，他们正在对软件和硬件两方面实施非常严厉的监管，我们可以深入探讨这一点。

我认为在特朗普政府的领导下，我们的方针是希望美国赢得 AI 竞赛。这是一场全球竞争。我们有时会提到中国可能是我们在这个领域的主要竞争对手。他们是唯一拥有技术能力、人才、知识和专业技能来击败我们的国家。我们希望确保美国获胜。当然，在美国，真正负责创新的不是政府，而是私营部门。这意味着我们的公司必须获胜，如果你对它们施加各种疯狂、繁重的监管，那只会伤害而不是帮助它们。

因此，总统在几个月前的 7 月 23 日发表了一篇我认为非常重要的 AI 政策演讲，他明确表示我们必须赢得 AI 竞赛，并阐述了实现这一目标的几个支柱：支持创新、支持基础设施（这也意味着支持能源）和支持出口。如果你愿意，我们可以深入探讨所有这些方面，但这就是大致的方针。所以，我认为，对于 AI，思路更像是如何释放创新。而对于加密货币，则更多地是关于如何创造监管的确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's talked about how surprised he was at what a big ovation he got at that. So he said it again and the crowd erupted again but in any event he promised basically to provide this clarity so that the industry would understand what the rules are, be able to comply, in turn that should provide greater protection for consumers and businesses, everyone who's part of the ecosystem, and it makes America more competitive. So I think that's sort of the mandate on crypto is in a way it's pro-regulation. It's basically we want to put in place regulations.

In a way AI is kind of the opposite where I think the Biden administration was too heavy-handed. They were starting to really regulate this area without even understanding what it was. They had no one had really taken the time to understand how AI was even being used, what the real dangers were. There was this intense fear-mongering and as a result of that, the approach of the Biden administration was they were in the process of implementing very heavy-handed regulations on both the software and hardware side and we can drill into that.

I think that with the Trump administration, the approach has been that we want the United States to win the AI race. It's a global competition. Sometimes we mention the fact that China is probably our main competitor in this area. They're the only other country that has the technological capability, the talent, the knowhow, the expertise to beat us in this area. And we want to make sure the United States wins. And of course in the US it's not really the government that's responsible for innovation. It's the private sector. So that means that our companies have to win and if you're imposing all sorts of crazy, burdensome regulation on them then that's going to hurt not help.

So the president gave a I think very important AI policy speech a couple months ago on July 23rd where he declared in no uncertain terms that we had to win the AI race and he laid out several pillars on how we do that. It was pro-innovation, pro infrastructure, which also means pro energy and pro export. And we can drill into all those things if you want, but that was sort of the high line. And so I think that, again with AI, the idea is kind of like how do we unleash innovation? And I think with crypto, it's been more about how do we create regulatory certainty.</p>
</details>

>> 至于我的角色，为什么我同时负责这两个领域？我认为共同点在于，这些都是新技术。它们都源于科技行业，而科技行业的文化与华盛顿截然不同。我把我的角色看作是帮助在硅谷和华盛顿之间架起一座桥梁，帮助华盛顿不仅理解所需的政策或正在发生的创新，还要从文化上理解，是什么让科技行业与众不同、如此特别，以及如何保护它免受政府过度严厉的干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of my role, like why am I doing both? I mean, I think the common denominator is just again, these are new technologies. They obviously come from the tech industry, which has a very different culture than Washington does. And I kind of see it as my role to help be a bridge between what's happening in Silicon Valley and what's happening in Washington and helping Washington understand not just the policy that's needed or the innovation that's happening but also kind of culturally, what makes the tech industry different and special and how that needs to be protected from government doing something excessively heavy-handed.</p>

### 监管捕获：AI 行业内部的危险信号

>> David，我们今天会重点讨论 AI，但关于加密货币，我今年有一个有趣的经历。在大选之后，人们适应了政府的更迭，我与一些政治人物进行了讨论，他们之前是反加密货币的，现在正试图找到一个更明智的立场。同时，我也和金融服务行业的人聊过，他们之前只是远远地观望，可能在不真正了解情况的情形下参与了各种揭穿加密货币的活动。但他们的共同点是，他们会说：“Mark，我以前真的不明白情况有多糟糕。我基本上以为你们科技圈的人只是在不停地抱怨，像个特殊利益集团一样在游说。我以为那些恐怖故事，比如人们被起诉，企业家的房子被 FBI 突袭等等，都是编造出来的。现在回过头来看，我才发现，天啊，这比我想象的要严重得多。” 你有这样的经历吗？当你身处其中，对所有发生的事情有了全面的了解后，你认为人们真的理解当时的情况有多糟糕吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So David, you know, we're going to talk a lot about AI today, but just on crypto, I've had this interesting experience this year kind of after the election, people adjusted to the change of government. And I've had this discussion with a number of people who, let's say, in politics who were previously anti-crypto, who have been trying to figure out how to kind of get to a more sensible position. And then also actually people in the financial services industry who kind of followed it from a distance, and maybe participated in the various debunking things without really understanding what was happening. But the common denominator has been they're like "you know Mark I didn't really understand how bad it was. I basically thought you guys in tech were basically just whining a lot, and pleading as a special interest, and kind of doing the normal thing. And I figured the horror stories were kind of made up, of people getting prosecuted and entrepreneurs getting their houses raided by the FBI and, you know, like the whole panoply of things that happened and like I didn't really I now in retrospect now that I go back and look, I'm like, 'Oh my god, this was actually much worse than I thought.'" Do you have that experience? And as you're in there and kind of as you now have like a complete view of everything that happens, like do you think people understand actually how bad it was?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为这是一个很好的观点。我以前其实也不知道。我们只是大概听说过有“去银行化”（debanking）的情况发生。顺便说一句，不仅是加密货币公司被去银行化，它们的创始人个人也被去银行化了。所以，如果你是一家加密货币公司的创始人，你甚至无法开设银行账户。这是一个巨大的问题。你怎么交易？怎么付款？怎么给员工发工资？这基本上剥夺了你的生计，是一种非常极端的审查形式。所以这确实在发生。当然，还有 SEC 主导的所有起诉。所以，是的，情况真的很糟糕。

我记得大概在三月份，我们在白宫举办了一个加密货币峰会。其中一位与会者说：“一年前，我以为我进监狱的可能性比来白宫的可能性更大。” 所以，这对整个行业来说是一个非常重要的里程碑。他们从未得到过任何形式的认可。在白宫为这个行业举办活动，这个想法本身就……至少，我认为加密货币被视为非常不入流的。但无论如何，这确实是一个巨大的转变。我们基本上已经制止了那种情况。而且，这非常不公平，因为这些创始人想要遵守规则，但却没人告诉他们规则是什么。我认为这都是一个蓄意策略的一部分，目的就是把加密货币行业赶出美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think it's a great point. I mean, I didn't really know either. You kind of heard generally. I mean, we knew that there was debanking going on and by the way, it wasn't just crypto companies that were being debanked, but their founders were being debanked personally. So, if you were the founder of a crypto company, you couldn't open a bank account. I mean, that's a huge problem. It's like how do you transact? How do you make payments? How do you pay people? I mean it basically deprives you of a livelihood. It's a very extreme form of censorship. So that was definitely happening. And then of course you have all the prosecutions that the SEC was behind. So yeah, it was really bad.

I remember back in I think it was in March we had a crypto summit at the White House and one of the attendees said that "a year ago I would have thought it was more likely that I'd be in jail than that I'd be at the White House." And so it was a really big milestone for the industry. They had never ever received any kind of recognition like that. The idea that this was even a industry that you would do an event at the White House. I mean at a minimum I think crypto is seen as very déclassé. But in any event yeah no it's been a huge shift. I mean, we basically have stopped that. And it was very unfair because again, these founders wanted to comply with the rules, but they weren't told what they were. And that was all part of a deliberate strategy, I think, to drive crypto offshore.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我们注意到加密货币和 AI 之间一个非常不同的地方是，在加密货币领域，每个人都只想要规则，整个行业相对团结。但在 AI 领域，我们看到了一些非常有趣的“内鬼”呼声，某些公司真的在寻求**监管捕获**（Regulatory Capture: 指监管机构本应为公众利益服务，但实际上被其所监管的行业或利益集团所控制或影响的现象），那些已经取得领先地位的人说：“让我们阻止所有新公司开发 AI”等等。你对此有何看法？你认为这会走向何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One of the things that is very different between crypto and AI that we've noticed is that on the crypto front, everybody just wanted rules, and the industry was relatively unified. Whereas in AI, we've seen very like interesting kind of calls coming from inside the house with certain companies really going for regulatory capture. You know, people who have early leads saying let's cut off all new companies from developing AI and so forth. What do you make of that and and where do you think that's going?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为这是一个非常大的问题。我最近就批评了我们的一家 AI 模型公司，因为它在搞监管捕获策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a very big problem. I actually recently criticized one of our AI model companies for engaging in regulatory capture strategy.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便说一句，这是非常公正的批评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very fair criticism by the way.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，非常公正。而且，他们当然否认了，然后……我该不该讲这个故事？很少有人能在 X（前身为 Twitter）上得到如此彻底和完全的证实。在这家公司——基本上是 Anthropic——否认之后，发生的事情是，Jack Clark，他是 Anthropic 的联合创始人和政策负责人，在一个会议上发表演讲。

他说，对 AI 的恐惧就像一个孩子看到黑暗中的怪物，或者认为黑暗中有怪物，但当你打开灯，怪物就在那里。我认为这是一个非常荒谬的比喻。这基本上是幼稚的，几乎是自我控诉，因为你基本上承认了这种恐惧是编造出来的，不是真实的。

总之，我说：“这是在散播恐惧，是他们监管捕获策略的一部分。” 他们当然否认了。但后来，人群中一位律师说：“是的，但 Jack 没告诉你们他在问答环节说了什么。” 他基本上承认了 Anthropic 所做的一切，比如 SB53 法案，表面上只是为了提高透明度，但他承认那只是他们实现真正目标的垫脚石。

他们的真正目标是在华盛顿建立一个预批准系统，在你发布新模型之前必须获得批准。而且他在问答环节承认，让人们感到非常恐惧是他们策略的一部分。所以，这简直就是你在 X 上的口水战中能找到的最确凿的证据了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is very fair and actually, of course they denied it and then, should I tell the story? Rarely do you get vindicated on X so thoroughly and completely as I did on this because after this company, it was basically Anthropic, after they denied it. There was, what basically happened is that Jack Clark who's a co-founder and head of policy for Anthropic, gave a speech at a conference where he said that he compared fear of AI to a child seeing monsters in the dark or thinking there were monsters in the dark and but then you turn the lights on and the monsters are there. I thought that was such a ridiculous analogy. I mean it's basically puerile. I mean, it's so childish just to be almost self-indicting because you're basically admitting the fear is made up, not real.

In any event, so I said, "Well, this is like fear-mongering and part of their regulatory capture strategy." And of course, they denied it. But then a lawyer who was in the crowd at his speech said, "Well, yeah, but Jack's not telling you what he said during the Q&A, which he basically admitted that everything that Anthropic was doing with like things like SB53, which is supposedly just implementing transparency." He said, "No, that's all, he admitted that was just a stepping stone to their real goal, which was to get an approval, a system of pre-approvals in Washington before you can release new models." And he admitted as part of the Q&A that making people very afraid was part of their strategy. So again, just as much as a smoking gun as you could ever get in a spat on X.</p>

### 无需许可的创新：硅谷成功的基石

我认为这种做法之所以如此具有破坏性，是因为过去几十年来让硅谷如此特别的核心是**无需许可的创新**（Permissionless Innovation: 指创业者或开发者可以在不需要事先获得政府或任何中央机构批准的情况下，自由地创造、实验和推出新产品或服务的原则）。就是说，两个在车库里的人就可以追求他们的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the reason why I think that that approach is so damaging is that the thing that's really made I think Silicon Valley special over the past several decades is permissionless innovation. Right? It's that two guys in a garage can just pursue their idea.</p>
</details>

>> 也许他们从天使投资人或风险投资公司那里筹集一些资金，这些人基本上是愿意亏掉所有钱的。这些年轻的创始人，也可能是未来某个宿舍里的辍学生，他们能够自由地追求自己的想法。我认为这只在硅谷发生，而像制药、医疗、国防或银行这些高度管制的行业，你根本看不到多少创业公司，原因就在于它们都受到严格监管。

这意味着你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能做事。我在华盛顿看到的是，审批制度的设立总有其原因，但这些原因很快就不再重要了。重要的是你的政府事务团队在官僚体系中游刃有余、搞定审批的能力有多强。而这并不是典型的创业公司创始人所擅长的。大公司则会擅长这个，因为他们有资源，而这正是监管捕获的含义。

所以，硅谷成功的整个基础，它之所以成为美国经济的皇冠明珠和世界其他地方羡慕的对象——我们看到所有其他国家都在尝试创建自己的硅谷——原因就在于无需许可的创新。而现在正在针对 AI 酝酿、讨论和实施的是一个针对软件和硬件的审批系统。

这并非理论。在硬件方面，这已经发生了。拜登政府在最后一周做的最后一件事之一就是实施了所谓的“拜登扩散规则”，要求地球上每一笔 GPU 的销售都必须获得政府的许可，也就是说要预先批准，除非它符合某些例外类别。但总的来说，其核心思想是，计算能力现在将成为一个需要许可和预先批准的类别。我们已经废除了那个规则。

然后在软件方面，就像我说的，目标非常明确，就是从向政府、向各州提交报告要求开始，然后逐步升级到你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能发布新模型。这会极大地减缓创新速度，降低美国的竞争力。这些审批可能需要几个月，甚至几年。当每年都有新芯片发布，而我们的许可证申请已经在审批流程中躺了两年时，等到最终获批，这些请求早就过时了。

对于模型来说更是如此，新模型的周期时间大概是三到四个月。华盛顿的官僚机构对这项技术又能了解多少，以至于他们能有资格去批准它呢？但无论如何，这就是现在正在考虑的事情，我认为这对硅谷、对创新，乃至对美国的竞争力来说都将是一场灾难。我认为，如果我们采用这套规则，我们将在 AI 竞赛中输给像中国这样的国家。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, maybe they raise some capital from angels or VC firms. Basically people who are willing to lose all of their money and these are people who, you know, are young founders. They could also be the future dropout in a dorm room and they're able just to pursue their idea. And the only reason that I think has happened in Silicon Valley whereas you look at in industries like pharma or healthcare or defense or banking or these highly regulated industries where you just don't see a lot of startups is because they're all heavily regulated which means you have to go to Washington to get permission to do things. And the thing I've seen in Washington is just that, you know, the approvals get set up for reasons, but those reasons very quickly stop mattering. And it just matters like how good your government affairs team is at navigating through the bureaucracy and figuring out how to get those approvals. And it's not something that your typical startup founders are going to be good at. It's something that big companies get good at because they've got the resources and that's exactly what regulatory capture means.

So the whole basis of Silicon Valley success, the reason why it's really the crown jewel of the American economy and the envy of the rest of the world. We see all these attempts by all these other countries to create their own Silicon Valley. The reason that's the case is because of permissionless innovation. And what is being contemplated and discussed and implemented with respect to AI is an approval system for both software and hardware. This is not theoretical. This has already been happening on the hardware side. One of the last things that the Biden administration did the last week the Biden administration was impose the so-called Biden diffusion rule which requires that every sale of a GPU on Earth be licensed by the government which is to say preapproved unless it fits into some category of exception but basically the overall idea is that compute is now going to be a licensed and and pre-approved category. We rescinded that.

And then on the software side like I said I mean the goal very clearly is to start with these reporting requirements to the government to the states and then where that ramps up to is you have to go to Washington to get permission before you release a new model and you know it's this would drastically slow down innovation and make America less competitive. I mean, you know, these approvals can take months, they can take years. When a new chip is released every year and we have licenses that have been sitting in the hopper for 2 years, I mean, the requests are obsolete by the time they finally get approved. And that would be even more true with models where, you know, the cycle time is like three or four months for a new model. I mean, you know, and what exactly is a bureaucracy in Washington going to know about this technology that they're that they're going to be in a good position to approve it. Any event, but this is what is being contemplated right now and I think it would be a disaster for Silicon Valley, but also and for innovation, but therefore for American competitiveness and I think we will lose the AI race to countries like China if this is the set of rules that we have.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。他们论点中一个非常阴险的地方在于，如果他们真的相信有怪物存在，那为什么他们购买 GPU 的速度比任何人都快？另外，作为业内人士我们知道，他们在自己代码的安全实践方面的声誉是整个行业里最差的。所以，如果你在建造这个怪物，你最不想做的事情就是留下各种漏洞让别人来攻击。所以他们说的那些话，他们自己一个字都不信。这完全是为了通过同样疯狂的手段来维持他们的领先地位而编造出来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One of the really diabolical things about their argument is if they really believed there was a monster then why are they buying GPUs like at a rate faster than anybody? And then the other thing that we know from being in the industry is their reputation is the literally the worst security practices in the entire industry with respect to their own code. So if you were building this monster, the last thing you'd want to do is like leave a bunch of holes around for people to hack it. So they don't believe anything they're saying. It's like completely made up to try and maintain their lead by the same psychotic.</p>

### 奥威尔式 AI：真正的风险所在

>> 在所有公司中，那家公司在监管捕获和推动这些法规方面最为激进。让我们把话题提升一个层次，不只是针对他们。目前有大约 1200 项法案正在各州立法机构审议，旨在监管 AI。其中 25% 集中在加利福尼亚、纽约、科罗拉多和伊利诺伊这四个主要的蓝州。已经有超过一百项措施获得通过。仅在加州，上个月就有三项法案签署成为法律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, but I think that is definitely... So I think of all the companies that particular one has been the most aggressive in terms of the regulatory capture and pushing these for these regulations. And just, I mean let's just bring it up a level, just doesn't have to be about them. There's now something like 1,200 bills going through state legislators right now to regulate AI. 25% of them are in the top four blue states which are California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. Over a hundred measures have already passed. I think three of them just got signed in the last month in California alone.</p>

>> 我来告诉你科罗拉多、伊利诺伊和加利福尼亚实际上都做了什么。它们都推出了某种版本的“算法歧视”法案。我认为这个概念的发展方向非常令人担忧。这个概念的意思是，如果模型产生的输出对某个受保护群体产生了不成比例的负面影响，那么这就是算法歧视。而受保护群体的名单非常长，远不止通常的那几个。例如，在科罗拉多州，他们将英语水平可能不高的人定义为受保护群体。所以，我猜如果模型说了关于非法移民的坏话，那就基本上违反了法律。

我不知道模型公司到底该如何遵守这项规定。按理说，歧视本身已经是违法的。所以，如果你是一家企业，违反了民权法，进行了歧视，你已经要为此负责了。如果你碰巧犯了这个错误，并且在过程中使用了任何工具，我们其实不需要去追究工具开发者的责任，因为我们已经可以追究做出那个决定的企业的责任。但这些法律的全部目的就是针对工具本身。他们不仅让使用 AI 的企业承担责任，还让工具开发者承担责任。

我甚至不知道工具开发者该如何预见这种情况，因为你怎么知道你的工具会被用在哪些方面？你怎么知道某个输出，特别是当这个输出是 100% 真实和准确，模型在正常工作的情况下，你怎么知道这个输出被用作了一个产生不成比例影响的决策的一部分？然而，你还是要承担责任。

我能想到的模型开发者唯一尝试遵守的方式，就是在他们的模型中内置一个 **DEI**（Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元、公平和包容）层，试图预测“这个答案是否会产生不成比例的影响？” 如果会，我们要么不能给你答案，要么必须对答案进行净化或扭曲。你把这个推到逻辑的尽头，我们就又回到了“觉醒 AI”（woke AI）的时代，顺便说一句，这正是拜登政府的一个主要目标。

我们废除的那份拜登关于 AI 的行政命令，其中有大约 20 页的 DEI 语言。他们非常努力地在模型中推广他们所谓的“DEI 价值观”。我们已经看到了结果是什么。我们看到了那个“黑人乔治·华盛顿”事件，历史被实时改写，因为有人在模型中内置了一个 DEI 层。

我甚至觉得“觉醒 AI”这个词不足以解释正在发生的事情，因为它在某种程度上把问题简单化了。我们真正谈论的是**奥威尔式 AI**（Orwellian AI）。我们谈论的是会向你撒谎、扭曲答案、为了服务于当权者当前的政治议程而实时改写历史的 AI。这非常奥威尔式，而在特朗普总统当选之前，我们无疑正走在那条路上。这曾是拜登行政命令的一部分，我们在第一个 Gemini 模型的发布中也看到了它的发生。那些被扭曲的输出不是偶然出现的，它们是有来源的。

所以对我来说，这才是 AI 最大的风险。它不是詹姆斯·卡梅隆描述的那样，而是乔治·奥威尔描述的那样。在我看来，风险不是《终结者》，而是《1984》。随着 AI 吞噬互联网，成为我们在线互动和获取信息的主要方式，当权者会利用它来控制我们接收的信息。它会包含意识形态偏见，基本上会对我们进行审查。所有为社交媒体创建的“信任与安全”机制都将被移植到这个新的 AI 世界。Mark，我知道你对此谈论过很多，我认为你完全正确。

除此之外，还有监控问题。AI 将会了解你的一切，成为你的个人助理。因此，它对政府来说是监控和控制你的完美工具。对我而言，这才是 AI 迄今为止最大的风险，也是我们应该努力防止的事情。问题在于，很多由这些散播恐惧的手段催生出来的法规，实际上是在赋予政府权力，去进行这种我认为我们都应该非常害怕的控制。

<p class="english-text">I'll tell you what Colorado is actually... Colorado, Illinois, and California have all done some version of a thing called algorithmic discrimination, which I think is really troubling where it's headed. What this concept means is that if the model produces an output that has a disparate impact on a protected group then that is algorithmic discrimination and the list of protected groups is very long. It's more than just the usual ones. So, for example, in Colorado, they've defined people who may not have English language proficiency as a protected group. So, I guess if the model says something bad about, you know, illegal aliens and that would be, you know, that would basically violate the law.

I don't know exactly how model companies are even supposed to comply with this rule. I mean, presumably, discrimination is already illegal. So if you're a business and you violate the civil rights laws and you engage in discrimination, you're already liable for that. You know, if you happen to make that mistake and you use any kind of tool in the process of doing it, we don't really need to go after the tool developer because we can already go after the business that's made that decision. But the whole purpose of these laws is to get at the tool. They're making not just the business that is using AI liable, they're making the tool developer liable.

And I don't even know how the tool developer is supposed to anticipate this because how do you know all the ways that your tool is going to be used? How do you know that this output, you know, especially if the output is 100% true and accurate and the model is doing its job? Um you know then how are you supposed to know that that output was used as part of a decision that had a disparate impact? Nevertheless, you're liable.

And the only way that I can see for model developers to even attempt to comply with this is to build a DEI layer into their models that tries to anticipate could this answer have a disparate impact? And if it does, we either can't give you the answer. We have to sanitize or distort the answer. And you know, you just take this to its logical conclusion and we're back to, you know, woke AI, which by the way was a major objective of the Biden administration. That Biden executive order on AI that we rescinded as part of the Trump administration had something like 20 pages of DEI language in it. They were very much trying to promote DEI values, they called it, in models.

And we saw what the result of that was. You know, it was, you know, we saw the whole black George Washington thing where history was being rewritten in real time because somebody built, you know, a DEI layer into the model. And I almost feel like the term woke AI is insufficient to explain what's going on because it somehow trivializes it. I mean, what we're really talking about is Orwellian AI. You know, we're talking about AI that lies to you, that distorts an answer that rewrites history in real time to serve a current political agenda of the people who are in power. I mean, it's very Orwellian and we were definitely on that path before President Trump's election. It was part of the Biden EO. We saw it happen, you know, in the release of that first Gemini model. That was not an accident that those distorted outputs came from somewhere.

So it was, you know, to me this is the biggest risk of AI actually is it's not it was not described by James Cameron it was described by George Orwell. You know it's in my view it's not the Terminator it's 1984 that as AI eats the internet and becomes the main way that we interact and get our information online that it'll be used by the people in power to control the information we receive. That it'll contain an ideological bias that essentially it'll censor us. All that trust and safety apparatus that was created for social media will be ported over to this new world of AI. Mark, I know that you've spoken about this quite a bit. I think you're absolutely right about that.

And then on top of that, you've got the surveillance issues where, you know, AI is going to know everything about you. It's going to be your kind of personal assistant. And so it's kind of the perfect tool for the government to monitor and control you. And to me that is by far the biggest risk of AI. And that's the thing we should be working towards preventing. And the problem is a lot of these regulations that are being whipped up by these fear-mongering techniques, they're actually empowering the government to engage in this type of control that I think we should all be very afraid of.

### AI 发展现状：一个“金发姑娘”情景

>> Sam Altman 本周早些时候表示，他预计到 2028 年将拥有自动化的研究人员。我很好奇你对 AI 模型开发或整体进展的看法是什么？你认为这意味着什么？有些人一直在说，**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 人工通用智能，指拥有与人类相当或超越人类智慧的 AI 系统）两年内就会到来，比如那些“AI 2027”论文，还有 Leopold Aschenbrenner 的“态势感知”论文。我很好奇你对 AI 发展的现状以及其影响的解读是什么？

<p class="english-text">Sam Altman earlier this week said that in 2028 or by 2028, he expects to have automated researchers. I'm curious just for your sort of state of of AI sort of model development or or just progress in general and what do you think are the implications?

I'm curious kind of what's your reading of the of the state of play in terms of AI development and what are the implications from that?</p>

>> 我的感觉是，硅谷的人们正在从所谓的“AGI 迫在眉睫”的叙事中后退。我看到 Andrej Karpathy 在一次采访中突然改写了这种说法，他说 AGI 至少还有十年之遥。他基本上是说，强化学习有其局限性。它非常有用，是目前取得很大进展的主要范式，但他表示，人类的学习方式其实并非主要通过强化。我们做的事情有点不同，我认为这是件好事，因为这意味着人类和 AI 将是协同的。如果 AI 的理解是基于强化学习，那它将与我们的直觉和推理方式有所不同。但无论如何，我感觉到人们正在从这种“AGI 迫在眉睫”的叙事中退缩。

“AGI 两年内到来”的说法，当然，人们对 AGI 的定义并不清楚，但它被用在一种可怕的方式中，指的是那种会超越我们控制的超级智能。我感觉人们正在从这种说法中后退，并开始理解，是的，我们仍在取得很大进展，而且进展惊人，但同时，我们所说的“智能”是多方面的，进步并非在所有维度上都同时发生。

因此，我实际上将我们现在所处的情况描述为有点像一个“金发姑娘”情景（Goldilocks scenario，指恰到好处、不过度也不足的状态）。两个极端情况是，一种是可怕的《终结者》情景，即迫在眉睫的超级智能将超越我们的控制；另一种你在媒体上经常听到的说法是，我们正处在一个巨大的泡沫中，也就是说整件事都是假的。媒体基本上在同时推动这两种叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, my sense is that people are in Silicon Valley are kind of pulling back from the let's call it imminent AGI narrative. I saw Andrej Karpathy gave an interview where all of a sudden he's rewritten this and he says AGI is at least a decade away. He's basically saying that reinforcement learning has its limits. I mean it's very useful. It's the main paradigm right now that they're making a lot of progress with. But he says that actually the way that humans learn is not really through reinforcement. We do something a little different which I think is a good thing because it means that human and AI will be synergistic, right? The AI's understanding if it's based on RL will be a little different than the way that we intuit it and reason. But in any event, I sense more of a pullback from this imminent AGI narrative.

The idea that AGI is two years away. Of course, it's kind of unclear what people mean by AGI, but it's kind of, you know, it was used in this like scary way that it's kind of the super intelligence that would grow beyond our control. I feel like people are pulling back from that and understanding that yes we're still making a lot of progress and the progress is amazing but at the same time you know what we mean by intelligence is multifaceted and it's not like there's progress being made along some dimensions but it's not along every dimension.

Therefore I think again I would just I mean I've described actually the situation we're in right now as a little bit of a Goldilocks scenario where the extremes would be you know you kind of have the scary Terminator situation imminent super intelligence that'll grow beyond our control on the other the other narrative you hear in the press a lot is that we're in a big bubble. So in other words the whole thing is fake and the media is basically pushing both narratives at the same time.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。但无论如何，我认为真相更居于两者之间。这是一种“金发姑娘”情景，我们看到了大量的创新，我认为进展令人印象深刻，经济将因此获得巨大的生产力提升。但我喜欢 Balaji 最近提出的一些观察。有几点真的触动了我。一点是，AI 是多神论的，而非一神论的。意思是，我们看到的不是一个全知全能的神，而是许多更小的神祇，即更专业的模型。我们还没有走上那种递归式自我改进的轨道，但我们看到许多不同类型的模型在不同领域取得进展。

另一点是他的观察，即 AI 是“中段到中段”（middle to middle），而人类是“端到端”（end to end），因此两者关系是相当协同的。我认为这是对的。我认为所有这些观察都与我对自己目前所处位置的感受产生了共鸣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But any event, I think that the truth is is more in the middle. It's kind of a Goldilocks scenario where we're seeing a lot of innovation. I think the progress is impressive. I think we're going to see big productivity gains in the economy from this. But I like the observations that Balaji made recently where he said there's a couple of things that really struck me. One was AI is polytheistic, not monotheistic. Meaning what we're seeing is many instead of just one all-knowing all powerful god. What we're seeing is a bunch of smaller deities, more specialized models. It's not that sort of we're not on that kind of recursive self-improvement track just yet but you know we're seeing many different kinds of models make progress in different areas.

And then the other one was just his observation that AI was middle to middle whereas humans are end to end and therefore the relationship is is pretty synergistic and I think that's right. I mean I think all those observations are like resonate with me in terms of where we're at right now.</p>

### 开源与去中心化：确保 AI 民主化的关键

>> 我认为这项技术保持去中心化非常重要，因为那种奥威尔式的担忧是终极的中心化。幸运的是，到目前为止，我们在市场上看到的是高度竞争。有五家主要的模型公司都在进行巨额投资。模型的性能评估相对集中，并且有很多蛙跳式超越的现象。比如，Grok 发布新模型，超越了 ChatGPT，但随后 ChatGPT 发布新东西，又反超回来。所以它们都非常有竞争力，彼此非常接近。我认为这是件好事。

这与通过“AGI 迫在眉睫”的故事所预测的恰恰相反。那个故事的说法是，一个模型会取得领先，然后它会利用自己的智能来让自己变得更好，因此它的领先优势会越来越大，你就会得到这种递归式的自我改进，很快你就会走向奇点。但我们并没有真正看到这种情况。我们没有看到一个模型在能力上完全甩开其他模型。我认为这是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's so important that this technology remain decentralized because the kind of the Orwellian concern is kind of the ultimate centralization. And fortunately so far what we're seeing in the market is that it's hyper competitive. There's five major model companies all making huge investments. And the model performance, the evaluations are relatively clustered and there's a lot of leapfrogging going on. So, you know, Grok releases new model, it leapfrogs ChatGPT and but then ChatGPT releases something new, they leap frog. So they're all like very competitive and close to each other. And I think that's a good thing.

And it's the opposite of what was predicted, you know, through this like imminent AGI story where the storytelling there was that one model would get a lead and then it would direct its own intelligence to making itself better and then so therefore its lead would get bigger and bigger and you kind of get this recursive self-improvement and pretty soon you're off to the singularity. And we haven't really seen that, you know, we haven't seen one model completely pull away in terms of capabilities. And I think that's a good thing.</p>
</details>

>> 你提到关于虚拟 AI 研究员的说法，那是“AGI 迫在眉睫”叙事的一个变体，即步骤是：模型变得更聪明，然后模型创造出虚拟 AI 研究员，然后你得到一百万个虚拟 AI 研究员，然后就是奇点。我认为这其中的障眼法在于，“虚拟 AI 研究员”到底是什么？说起来很容易，但它到底意味着什么？Toby（可能是指 Balaji）关于 AI 仍然是“中段到中段”而非“端到端”的观点很重要。如果一个 AI 研究员是端到端的，那么它需要自己解决问题，设定自己的目标，以 AI 无法做到的方式进行转向。创造一个虚拟 AI 研究员真的可行吗？我认为 AI 可以在工作的某些部分做得很好，甚至比人类更好，但这个工具可能还是需要由人类 AI 研究员来使用。

所以我怀疑这个论点可能是目的论的，也就是说，你可能需要 AGI 才能创造出虚拟 AI 研究员，而不是反过来。如果是这样，你就不会直接得到奇点。所以我对那个说法有点怀疑。我们拭目以待。Sam 说他能在 2028 年做到。我想我们到时候就知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so Eric to your point about this narrative about the virtual AI researcher that that was one variant of this sort of imminent AGI narrative is that the steps would be models get smarter then models create virtual AI researcher and then you get a million virtual AI researchers and then you know it's singularity and I think just the slight of hand in that is what is a virtual AI researcher right it's like a very easy thing to say, but like what does that really mean? And you know, Toby's point about AI is still middle to middle. It doesn't it's not end to end. So if an AI researcher is end-to-end, there's like things that has to you things the person has to figure out. They've got to set their own objective. They've got to be able to pivot in ways that AI can't.

You know, like is it really is that really feasible to create a virtual AI researcher? I think there's like parts of the job that you know AI could get really good at or even better than humans, but probably that tool has to be used by a human AI researcher. So I guess the argument I suspect could be sort of teleological in the sense that you might need AGI to create a virtual AI researcher as opposed to the other way around. And if that's the case, you don't just, you know, you're not going to get like singularity. So, I'm a little bit skeptical of that claim. We'll see. What Sam say he could do it in 2028. I mean, I guess we'll see.</p>

>> 他不是第一个提出这个想法的人。其他模型公司也一直在宣传这个，但……是的，Leopold 也提到了。我们会看到的。但我怀疑那个论点的错误之处在于，虚拟 AI 研究员需要 AGI，所以通过虚拟 AI 研究员获得 AGI 的想法是本末倒置的。但我们拭目以待。

<details>

<p class="english-text">He's not the first to mention that idea. Other model companies have been promoting it, but yeah, Leopold mentioned that too. We'll see.

<p class="english-text">Do you want to spend a moment on what you guys have been able to do on that and how you think about it?</p>

>> 是的，开源非常重要，因为我认为它等同于自由，软件自由。你基本上可以在自己的硬件上运行自己的模型，并保留对自己信息的控制权。顺便说一句，这是企业一直在做的事情。全球约一半的数据中心市场是本地部署的，意味着企业和政府建立自己的数据中心，而不是使用大型云服务。我不是对超大规模云服务商有任何意见，只是人们喜欢运行自己的数据中心，并保持对自己数据的控制。我认为在某种程度上，消费者也会如此。

所以我认为这是一个我们应该鼓励和推广的重要领域。目前市场上的一个讽刺之处在于，最好的开源模型是中国的。这有点奇怪，对吧？这与你的预期相反。你可能期望美国体系会促进开放，而中国体系会促进封闭。但结果有点颠倒了。

我认为这有其合理的原因。可能只是一个历史偶然，DeepSeek 的创始人非常致力于开源，这让事情以这种方式开始了。也可能这是一个深思熟虑的策略的一部分。如果你是中国，并且正在努力追赶，开源是一个非常好的方式，因为你可以吸引所有不结盟的开发者来帮助你的项目，这是封闭项目无法做到的。所以这是一个很好的追赶策略。另外，如果你认为你的商业模式，无论是作为公司还是国家，是规模化生产硬件，那么你就会希望软件部分是免费或便宜的，因为它是你的互补品。所以你会试图商品化你的互补品。我不知道这是偶然还是设计的一部分，但这似乎一直是中国战略。

我认为美国对此的正确回应是鼓励我们自己的开源。如果我们能看到更多开源项目启动，那将是一件很棒的事情。我猜有一个很有前途的项目叫做 Reflection，是由前谷歌 DeepMind 的工程师创立的。所以我希望我们能在西方看到更多的开源创新。但我认为这非常重要，是至关重要的。在我看来，它等同于自由，绝对不是我们想要压制的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean so just to the... open source is very important because I just think it's synonymous with freedom, I mean software freedom. You basically could run your own models on your own hardware and retain control over your own information.

And by the way this is what enterprises typically do all the time is you know about half the global data center market is on prem meaning enterprises and governments create their own data centers. They don't go to the big clouds and by the way I've got nothing against the hyperscalers but just you know people like to run their own data centers and maintain control over their own data and that kind of thing and I think that will be true for consumers to some degree as well.

So I do think it's an important area that we should want to encourage and promote. The irony right now in the market is that the best open source models are Chinese. And it's sort of a quirk, right? It's the opposite of what you'd expect. You'd expect like the American system would promote open and somehow the Chinese system would promote closed. That has kind of ended up being a little backwards.

I think there's like good reasons for it. It could just be it could just be kind of a historical accident. The fact that the Deep Seek founder was like very committed to open source and kind of just kind of that like got things started that way or it could be part of a deliberate strategy. If you're China and you're trying to catch up, open source is a really good way to do that because you get all the non-aligned developers to want to help your project which they can't do if you know with a closed project. So it's a great strategy for catching up. And then also if you think that your business model you know as a company or as a country is let's say scale manufacturing of hardware then you'd want the the software part to be free or cheap because it's your compliment right so you try to commoditize your compliment and I don't know whether it's by accident or part of design that that seems to be what the Chinese strategy has been.

I think that the right answer for the US in this is to encourage our own open source. I mean, we I think it'd be a great thing if we saw more open source initiatives get going. I guess there's one promising one called Reflection, which was founded by former engineers from Google Deep Mind. So I hope we see more open source innovation in the west. But look, I think it's very important. It's critical and like I said I in my view it's synonymous with freedom and it's definitely not something we want to suppress.</p>

### 赢得 AI 竞赛的三大支柱：创新、基建与出口

>> Peter Thiel 多年前曾说过，他认为加密货币将是自由主义的或去中心化的，而 AI 将是共产主义的或中心化的。我认为我们可能学到的一点是，技术并非决定论的，有一系列的选择决定了这些技术是去中心化的还是中心化的。也许我们可以以此为契机，深入探讨与中国的竞争状况。David，也许你可以阐述一下，要做好哪些事情最重要。你已经指出了开源是一个例子。你之前也提到了我们关于芯片的战略。有些人说，我们现在的做法是好的，因为它会限制国内半导体生产。另一些人则说，“哦，这些公司说芯片是他们最大的限制因素，所以我们是不是在某种程度上帮助了他们？” 你能谈谈目前的状况和我们的战略吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Peter Thiel quipped, you know, many years ago that he thought, you know, crypto would be libertarian or decentralizing and that AI would be communist or or centralizing. And I think one thing we've perhaps we've learned that technology isn't deterministic and that there are a set of choices that determine whether these technologies are decentralizing or or centralizing. And maybe we could use that as a segue to go deeper into the state of the race with China. Maybe David you could lay out the sort of the what's most important to to get right. You've already indicated you know open source is one example. You know you alluded earlier to sort of our strategy as relates to chips. You know some people say that yes it's it's a good idea to do what we're doing because it'll you know limit domestic semiconductor production. Other people say, "Oh, well, you know, some of these companies say chips are their biggest, you know, limiting factors and so are we enabling them in some way." Why don't you talk about the sort of state of play and then our strategy?</p>
</details>

>> 是的。当我们谈论赢得 AI 竞赛时，我们有时说是在与中国竞赛，有时我们说得更模糊一些，因为我认为我们不应该过分执着于我们的竞争对手或对手。我认为我们是否能赢，主要取决于我们对自己技术生态系统所做的决定，而不是我们对他们做了什么。

总统在他 7 月 23 日关于 AI 政策的演讲中，提到了我们赢得这场 AI 竞赛的几个关键支柱。顺便说一句，我不是说这场竞赛会结束，它可能是一场无限游戏，但我们至少要处于领先地位。我认为可能会有一段时间，就像互联网一样，虽然互联网仍在发展，但我们明白赢家格局已经基本定型。所以，AI 领域的赢家格局也可能会有一段定型期。

无论如何，关于我们如何赢得这场竞赛，我提到了几个关键支柱。**第一是创新**。支持私营部门非常重要，因为他们是创新的主体。我们不可能通过监管来战胜我们的对手，我们必须通过创新超越他们。我认为目前最大的障碍是各州疯狂的过度监管。我迫切地认为我们需要一个统一的联邦标准。一个由 50 个不同监管制度组成的拼凑体，合规成本将极其高昂。我认为即使是那些支持这些监管的人现在也承认我们需要一个联邦标准。问题是，当他们谈论这个时，他们真正想要的是将所有州法律中最繁重的版本联邦化，这也是不能允许的。

所以，将会有一场斗争。我认为随着各州变得越来越难以管理，随着它成为初创公司的陷阱——他们现在必须在 50 个不同时间向 50 个不同州的 50 个不同机构报告 50 种不同的事情——人们会意识到这太疯狂了，他们会试图将其联邦化。然后问题就在于，我们是得到一个严厉的联邦优先权，还是一个宽松的联邦优先权。我认为最终每个人都会支持一个单一的联邦标准，因为我认为美国最大的优势之一是我们有一个巨大的全国性市场，而不是 50 个独立的州市场。

**第二个重要领域是基础设施和能源**。我们希望帮助这个正在发生的惊人的基础设施建设热潮。我认为最大的限制因素将是能源。我认为特朗普总统在这方面非常有远见。他多年前就在谈论“钻探吧，宝贝，钻探吧”（drill baby drill）。他明白能源是一切的基础，当然也是这次 AI 热潮的基础。我们希望基本上扫除所有不必要的法规、许可限制，以及很多**邻避主义**（NIMBYism, Not In My Back Yard 的缩写，指居民因担心项目对自身造成负面影响而反对新项目建设的现象），以便 AI 公司可以建造数据中心并为其供电。

**第三个领域是出口**。这可能是最具争议的一个。它真正体现了硅谷和华盛顿之间的文化鸿沟。我想我们所有在硅谷的人都明白，赢得技术竞赛的方式是建立最大的生态系统。你让最多的开发者在你的平台上开发，你的应用商店里有最多的应用，每个人都用你的产品。那些通常获胜的公司是那些拥有所有用户、所有开发者的公司。所以我们硅谷有一种合作的心态。我们只想发布 API，让每个人都来使用。

华盛顿则有不同的心态。它更像是一种命令与控制。我们希望你获得批准，我们想囤积这项技术，只有美国应该拥有它。我认为这正是“拜登扩散规则”的根本所在，那个规则的要点就是阻止扩散。扩散是一个贬义词。但在硅谷我们明白，扩散才是你获胜的方式。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, when we talk about winning the AI race, um, sometimes we say we're in a race against China, sometimes we just leave it a little bit more vague because I don't think we should become overly obsessed with our competitors or adversaries. I think whether we win or not will mostly have to do with the decisions we make about our own technology ecosystem, not about, you know, what we do visa v them.

And so the president in his July 23rd speech on AI policy, I think mentioned a few of the key pillars of how we win this AI race. And by the way, I'm not saying it ever ends. This it might be an infinite game, but we want to be in the lead at least. And I do think that there could be a period of time where like you know take the internet where I mean the internet's still going on. It's happened but we understand that kind of who the winners are is kind of baked now. So there could be a period of time in which it's kind of baked who the winners in AI are.

But in any event, in terms of how we win this race, I mentioned a few of the key pillars. Number one is innovation. You know it's very important to support the private sector because they're the ones who do the innovation. We're not going to regulate our way to beating our adversary. We just have to out innovate them. I mentioned I think right now the biggest obstacle is the frenzy of overregulation happening at the states. I desperately think we need a federal a single federal standard. A patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes is going to be incredibly burdensome to comply with. I think even the people who support a lot of this regulation are now acknowledging that we're going to need a federal standard. The problem is that when they talk about it, what they really want is to federalize the most onerous version of all the state laws and that can't be allowed either.

So, you know, there's going to be a battle to come. I think as the states become more and more unwieldy, you know, as it becomes more of a trap for startups that they now have to report into 50 different states at 50 different times to 50 different agencies about 50 different things, people are going to realize this is crazy and they're going to try to federalize it. And then the question, I think, is whether we get preemption heavy or preemption light. I think everyone's gonna ultimately be in favor of a single federal standard. Because I think one of America's greatest advantages is that we have a large national market, right? Not 50 separate state markets.

The second big area is infrastructure, you know, and energy. You know, we want to help this amazing infrastructure boom that's happening. And the biggest, I think, limiting factor there is just going to be around energy. I think President Trump's been incredibly far-sighted in this. I mean, he was talking about drill baby drill many years ago. He understood that energy is the basis for everything. It's definitely the basis for this AI boom. And we want to basically get all of these unnecessary regulations, the permitting restrictions, a lot of the nimbyism out of the way so that AI companies can build data centers and get power for them.

And then the third area is around exports. And maybe this has been the most controversial one. And it really speaks to the cultural divide between Silicon Valley and Washington. So, I think all of us in Silicon Valley understand that the way that you win a technology race is by building the biggest ecosystem, right? You get the most developers building on your platform, you get the most apps in your app store, everyone just uses you. I mean, you know, those are the companies that typically win are the ones that get all the users, all the developers, and so on. And so we in Silicon Valley have a partnership mentality. You know, we want to just publish the APIs and get everyone using them. Washington has a different mentality, right? It's much more of a command and control. We want you to get approved. We kind of want to hoard this technology. Only America should have it. And this was really fundamental, I think, to the Biden diffusion rule where the point of that rule is to stop diffusion, right? Diffusion is a bad word. But in Silicon Valley we understand that diffusion is how you win.</p>

>> 我知道我们以前从没叫过它“扩散”，这对我来说是个新词。我们只叫它“用户量”。

<p class="english-text">I know I mean I don't think we ever called it diffusion before. That was a new word for me. We just called it usage.</p>

>> 是的。但我们明白，获得最多的用户才是获胜之道。所以现在正在发生一场根本性的文化冲突。我对此的分析是，我们决定卖什么给中国，这永远是个复杂的问题，因为他们是我们的竞争对手和对手，还有潜在的军民两用问题。所以卖什么给中国是个微妙的问题。但我们卖什么给世界其他地方，这应该是个简单的问题，那就是我们应该希望与世界其他地方做生意。我们应该希望拥有尽可能大的生态系统。

我们每将一个国家排除在我们的技术联盟之外，基本上就是把它们推向中国的怀抱，这让中国的生态系统变得更大。我们在拜登执政期间看到的是，他们不断地将其他国家推向中国的怀抱，从 2023 年 10 月的海湾国家开始。基本上，像沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋这些长期以来的美国盟友，被禁止从美国购买芯片。换句话说，他们不被允许建立数据中心和参与 AI。

我们告诉所有这些国家，AI 对未来至关重要，它将成为经济的基础，但我们却把你们排除在美国技术栈之外。那么，他们会做什么，这是显而易见的。我们给他们的唯一选择就是去找中国。所以，所有这些规定基本上只是为中国的芯片和模型创造了积压的需求，并创造了一个华为版的“一带一路”。我们听说华为已经开始在中东和东南亚扩散。我只是觉得这是一个非常适得其反的策略。我们完全是在搬起石头砸自己的脚。

最大的讽刺是，那些推动这种把所有国家都推向中国怀抱的策略的人，自称为“中国鹰派”，好像他们做的事情是在伤害中国。不，这实际上是在帮助中国。这基本上就是把市场拱手相让。我们的产品更好，但如果你不给这些国家购买美国技术栈的选择，他们显然会选择中国的技术栈。中国正在那里推广 DeepSeek 模型和华为芯片，他们才不会为是否向阿联酋出口用于数据中心的芯片会创造出《终结者》而操心，也不会为我们为了不向朋友出售美国技术而编造的那些荒谬叙事而烦恼。所以，这最终成了我们所倡导的最具争议性的部分，或许令人惊讶。但事实就是如此。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. But we understand that like getting the most users is how you win. So there's like a fundamental culture clash going on right now. And the way I kind of parse it is that what we decide to sell to China is always going to be complicated because you know they're our competitor and our adversary and there's the whole potential dual use and so the question of what you sell to China is is nuanced. But what we sell to the rest of the world that should be an easy question which is we should want to do business with the rest of the world. We should want to have the largest ecosystem possible. And every country we exclude from our technology alliance we're basically driving into the arms of China and it makes their ecosystem bigger and what we saw under the Biden years is that they were constantly pushing other countries into the arms of China starting with the Gulf states in October of 2023.

Basically the Gulf States and I'm talking about countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, long-standing US allies, they weren't allowed to buy chips from the US. In other words, they weren't allowed to set up data centers and participate in in AI. And you know, here we are telling all these countries that, you know, AI is fundamental to the future. It's going to be the basis of the economy, and yet we're excluding you from participating in the American tech stack. Well, you know, it's obvious what they're going to do. You know, the only play we're giving them is to go to China. And so, you know, all of these rules basically just create pent-up demand for for Chinese chips and models. And it creates a Huawei belt and road. And we are hearing that that Huawei is starting to proliferate or diffuse in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia. And I just think it's a really counterproductive strategy. We're completely shooting ourselves in the foot.

And like the the greatest irony is that the people who've been pushing this strategy of driving all these countries into China's arms have called themselves China hawks. You know, as if what they're doing is hurting China. No, it's like it's helping China. I mean, it's basically just handing them markets. And our products are better. But if you don't give these countries a choice to buy the American tech stack, obviously they're going to go with the Chinese tech stack. And you know, China's out there promoting Deepseek models and Huawei chips and they're not like ringing their hands about you know whether exporting chips for a data center in UAE is going to like create the Terminator and you know all these like ridiculous narratives that we've invented to you know reasons we've invented not to sell American technology to our friends. So, that has ended up being, I think, surprisingly maybe the most controversial part of what we've advocated for. But there you have it.</p>

### 加密货币法案：从战争走向全球资本

>> David，在我们还有时间的时候，快速回到加密货币的话题。本届政府和国家在今年早些时候取得了一项重大胜利，总统签署了稳定币法案（Genius Act）成为法律。我想告诉你，我们看到那个法律带来的积极后果甚至比我们想象的还要大。这对稳定币行业以及现在你看到的各种金融机构都产生了影响，它们都以前所未有的方式拥抱稳定币。这个现象正在美国蔓延，顺便说一句，我们在那里处于领先地位，做得非常好。

但更广泛地说，这也向加密行业发出了一个信号，即这确实是一个新时代。真的会有监管框架来使这些事情成为可能，这些框架既负责任，又能让这个行业在美国真正蓬勃发展。如你所知，现在正在制定第二项立法，即市场结构法案，称为“清晰法案”（Clarity Act），这是立法议程的第二阶段。我想知道你对那项法案重要性的看法，以及你认为那个过程进展如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So David just to come back real quick while we still have you on on crypto. So the administration and I think the country had a significant victory earlier this year with the president signing the stablecoin bill into law which was the Genius act. And I'll just tell you what we see is like the positive consequences of that law have been even bigger than we thought. And I would say that's both for the stable coin industry and you now see actually a lot of a lot of financial institutions of all kinds embracing stable coins in a way that that they weren't before.

And you know sort of the phenomenon spreading in America you know by the way doing you know being being in the lead and doing very well there. But just also more broadly just as a signal to the crypto industry that like this really is a new day. And there really there really are going to be regulatory frameworks that that make these things possible and and you know that that are responsible but also make this industry really possible to flourish in the US. As you know there's a second piece of legislation being constructed right now which is the market structure bill called the Clarity act which is sort of the phase two of the legislative agenda and I wondered maybe if you could just tell us a little bit about your view of of the importance of that of that bill and and then you know kind of how do you think that process is going</p>
</details>

>> 我认为它极其重要。正如你提到的，我们几个月前通过了《Genius 法案》，但这只针对稳定币。稳定币约占代币总市值的 6%。所以 94% 是所有其他类型的代币，而《Clarity 法案》将适用于所有这些代币，并为所有其他加密项目和公司提供监管框架。

如果我们能确定，我们现在有一位出色的 SEC 主席 Paul Atkins，并且能确保像 Paul Atkins 这样的人永远在 SEC，那么我们就不一定需要立法，因为他们已经在实施更好的规则并提供监管清晰度。但事实是，我们无法确定。如果你是一个创始人，现在正试图决定在哪里建立你的公司，你希望有未来 10 年、20 年的确定性。我们希望鼓励长期项目，所以我认为将规则法典化非常重要，首先是提供清晰度，然后确保其有足够的稳定性，并将这些规则写入立法。这是提供长期稳定性的唯一方法。

我认为我们会完成《Clarity 法案》。就像你提到的，它在众议院以大约 300 票通过，其中包括大约 78 名民主党人，所以它是具有实质性两党支持的。我认为它最终会通过。它现在正在参议院审议。我认为它最终会完成。我们正在与大约十几名民主党人谈判。我们必须达到 60 票。所以难点在于，根据阻挠议事的规则，我们必须达到 60 票。但我们正在与大约十几名民主党人谈判，我确实认为我们最终会达到那个数字。顺便说一句，我们最终在参议院为《Genius 法案》获得了 68 票，包括 18 名民主党人。所以我认为，即使我们只得到支持《Genius 法案》的民主党人数量的三分之二，我们在《Clarity 法案》上也会没问题。

但这将为除稳定币之外的所有其他代币提供监管框架。我认为这是一项至关重要的立法。这最终将完成加密货币的议程，我们从拜登的“加密货币战争”转向特朗普的“全球加密货币之都”。然后，我认为该行业将拥有所需的稳定性，可以专注于创新。

<p class="english-text">I think it's extremely important. So as you mentioned we we passed the Genius Act few months ago but that was just for stable coins. Stable coins are about 6% of the total market cap in terms of tokens. So 94% are all the other types of tokens and the Clarity Act would apply to all of that and provide the regulatory framework for all those other crypto projects and companies.

You know, if we could be sure that, you know, currently we have a great SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, and if we could be sure that Paul Atkins and a person like Paul Atkins was always at the SEC forever, then we wouldn't necessarily need legislation because they're already in the process of implementing like much better rules and providing regulatory clarity. But the truth is that we don't know for sure. And if you're a founder who's trying to make a decision now about where you're going to build your company, you want to have certainty for 10 years out, 20 years out. We want to encourage long-term projects and so again I think it's very important to canonize the rules that that's first to provide the clarity and then to make sure there's enough stability around them and sort of canonize those rules in legislation. That's the only way that you provide that long-term stability.

I think that we will get the Clarity Act done. Like you mentioned it passed the House with about 300 votes of about 78 Democrats. So it was substantially bipartisan. I think it will ultimately... we're it's now going through the Senate. I think it will ultimately get done. We're negotiating with a dozen or so Democrats. We have to get to 60 votes. So that's the hard part is under the filibuster. We got to get to 60. So but we're negotiating with about a dozen Democrats. And I do think that we will ultimately get to that number. We by the way we ended up having 68 votes in the Senate for genius including 18 Democrats. So, I do think that even if we just get, you know, two-thirds of the number of Democrats that we got for Genius, then, you know, we'll be fine on clarity.

But I, you know, it this will provide the regulatory framework again for all the other tokens besides stable coins. And I think it's just a critical piece of legislation. And yeah, this would ultimately I think kind of complete the crypto agenda where we've kind of you know moving from Biden's war on crypto to Trump's crypto capital of the planet. And then you know I think the industry will have the stability it needs and can just focus on innovating and</p>

>> 特朗普总统确实促成了《Genius 法案》的通过。首先，是他的当选完全改变了关于加密货币的对话。如果结果不同，我们现在可能还在 SEC 那里挣扎，创始人还在被起诉，我们还不知道规则是什么，Elizabeth Warren 会发号施令。所以，特朗普总统的当选让一切成为可能。正是他对这个行业的承诺，以及他兑现竞选承诺的决心，才使这一切成为可能。而且他还亲自参与确保《Genius 法案》通过。这项立法曾多次被宣布死亡。我亲眼看到他如何说服了 Rick Scott 等人投票，软硬兼施，魅力攻势，最终搞定了这件事。我认为《Clarity 法案》也会有类似的结果。人们总是过早地宣布这些事情死亡。立法过程有很多曲折，看“香肠制作过程”确实不是什么愉快的体验，但无论如何，我认为我们现在正走在正确的轨道上。

<p class="english-text">On Genius Act, President Trump really made that bill possible. I mean, first of all, it was his election that completely shifted the conversation on crypto. We would still be, you know, if a different result had been reached, we would have again like figure out at the SEC. The founders would still be getting prosecuted. We wouldn't know what the rules are. Elizabeth Warren would be calling the shots.

So, President Trump's election made everything possible. And it's his commitment to the industry and he and his commitment to keeping his promises during the election that's made all of this possible. But also I mean he got directly involved in making sure the Genius Act passed. It was the legislation was declared dead many times. I saw it with my own eyes that you know he was able to persuade Rick Scott and votes and twist arms, cajole and charm and he ultimately got it done and I think that clarity will be a similar result. People are always prematurely declaring these things to be dead or whatever. There are a lot of twists and turns in the legislative process. It's definitely true that you don't want to see the sausage getting made, but anyway, I think we're on a good track right now.</p>

### 城市治理：旧金山的挑战与希望

>> 最后，我们刚才谈到了纽约。最近在旧金山的一期 All-In 播客中，你支持派遣国民警卫队。Benioff 发表了他的评论，然后又反复修改。我很好奇，说到“教学时刻”，你认为旧金山还有救吗？如果可以，需要满足哪些条件才能实现？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lastly, we were just talking about New York. Recently in an episode all in in San Francisco, you endorsed bringing the National Guard. You know, Benioff had his comments. He sort of, you know, went back and forth with those comments. I'm curious if speaking of teaching moments, I'm curious if you see San Francisco as savable in some sense and and what what needs to be true to to get there if so.</p>
</details>

>> Daniel Lurie 是我们几十年来最好的市长。所以我认为他在旧金山所面临的限制条件下，做得非常出色。不幸的是，旧金山的市长权力很弱。我不是指他个人，而是整个制度设置。市议会有巨大的权力，并且随着时间的推移，他们设法将权力从市长转移到了自己手中。当然，还有所有那些左翼法官。

这让我感到震惊，现在有一个案子，几年前曾激励过我，就是 Troy Mallister 的案子。他是一个惯犯，在新年前夜杀害了两个人，我想大概是 2020 年。在那之前的一年里，他被逮捕了四次。他最终杀害了这两个人，并且有很长的犯罪史。他之前犯过持械抢劫，偷过很多车。他本应该在监狱里，不应该被释放。但他基本上是因为 Chesa Boudin 的零保释金政策而被释放的，当时他是地区检察官，后来被我们罢免了。当时引起了巨大的公愤。即使在旧金山，要罢免一个政治家……我的意思是，你得有多左，才能让旧金山人都疏远你。而 Chesa Boudin 成功地做到了这一点。

然而，我不知道为什么 Troy Mallister 还没有被判刑，并被关进监狱 20 年以上，但他的案子还在法院里没完没了地审理。还有一个左翼法官正在考虑只给他一个“转处”（diversion），基本上就是释放，可能戴个脚踝监视器之类的。这太疯狂了。

这就是我们在旧金山要处理的事情。疯狂的左翼法官想要释放所有罪犯。所以我只是在想，Daniel 是否面临太多的限制？因此，我知道他不想让总统派国民警卫队进来，但也许最终这会有所帮助。但无论如何，我认为总统已经同意暂时搁置此事。Daniel 与总统进行了一次很好的交谈，请求他暂缓行动，总统也同意了，并给他时间来实施他的解决方案。看，如果 Daniel 和他的团队能够继续取得进展，并在不需要国民警卫队介入的情况下解决问题，那就再好不过了。我们拭目以待。我知道他想这么做，而且就像我说的，他是我们几十年来最好的市长。问题只是他是否会受到城市里其他权力的过多限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Daniel Lurie is the best mayor we've had in decades. So, I think he's doing a very good job within the constraints that San Francisco presents. The mayor job, unfortunately, we have a weak mayor in San Francisco. I don't mean him, I just mean like the way it's all set up. The board of supervisors has a ton of power and over time they've been able to kind of transfer power from the mayor to themselves. And then of course you got all these leftwing judges.

I mean, it's just amazing to me that there's a case right now, this is a case that galvanized me several years ago, the case of Troy Mallister who was a repeat offender who killed two people on New Year's Eve. I think it was like 2020. And he was arrested four times, you know, in the year before that. He ended up killing these two people and he had a very very long criminal history. He had committed armed robbery before, stolen many cars. And he should have been in jail. He should not have been released. But he was basically released thanks to the zero bail policies of Chesa Boudin, who was then the district attorney who we got recalled. There was a huge outcry. I mean, even in San Francisco for there to be a recall of a politician, I mean, you got to be like seriously leftwing to alienate San Francisco and Chesa Boudin managed to be so far out there that he alienated even San Francisco.

And yet, I don't know why Troy Mallister isn't sentenced already and in jail for 20 years plus, but his case is still pending through the courts, never ending. And there's a leftwing judge who's considering just giving him diversion. Basically means you just get released maybe with an ankle bracelet or something. That's insane.

So, I mean, that's what we're dealing with in San Francisco. I mean, like crazy leftwing judges who want to release all the criminals. And so I just wonder like is Daniel up against too many constraints and therefore I know he doesn't want the president to send in the National Guard, but maybe ultimately it would be helpful. But in any event, I think the president has has agreed to kind of hold off on that out of you, you know, Daniel had a good conversation with the president and asked him to hold back and the president agreed and is giving him time to implement his solutions. And look, if if Daniel and his team can keep making progress and fix the problems without the National Guard having to come in, then so much the better. We'll just see if and and I know he wants to and like I said, he's the best mayor we've had in decades. It's just a question of whether he'll be too constrained by the other powers that be in the city.</p>
