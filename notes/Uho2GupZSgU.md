### 欧洲的监管“领导力”

欧洲人对所有这些东西的心态确实很不一样。当他们谈论人工智能领导力时，他们指的是在定义法规方面取得领先。你知道，他们在布鲁塞尔开会，研究所有规则应该是什么样的。这就是他们所谓的领导力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Europeans, I mean, they have a really different mindset for all this stuff. When they talk about AI leadership, what they mean is that they're taking the lead in defining the regulations. You know, they get together in Brussels and figure out what all the rules should be. And that's what they call leadership.</p>
</details>

主持人：这几乎就像一个游戏节目。他们想尽一切办法把初创公司扼杀在摇篮里，然后如果这些小公司在经历了十年的虐待后幸存下来，他们才会给钱让它们成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's almost like a game show or something. They do everything they can to strangle them in their crib and then if they make it through like a decade of abuse of small companies, then they're going to give them the money to grow.</p>
</details>

主持人：罗纳德·里根对此有一句名言：如果它在动，就给它征税；如果它还在动，就监管它；如果它不动了，就补贴它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Ronald Reagan had a line about this, which is if it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：欧洲人现在绝对处于“补贴它”的阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The Europeans are definitely at the subsidize it stage.</p>
</details>

### AI 与加密货币沙皇：为何将两者结合？

主持人：David，欢迎来到 a16z 播客。感谢你的加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> David, welcome to the a16z podcast. Thanks for joining.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：是的，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, good to be here.</p>
</details>

主持人：David，你现在是人工智能和加密货币的沙皇。你为什么不先谈谈，将这两个领域放在一个职责范围内为什么是合理的？它们之间有什么关联？然后，请你阐述一下特朗普在这两个领域的计划是什么，以及我们目前的进展如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, David, you're the AI and cryptozar. Why don't you first talk about why it makes sense to have those as a portfolio? What do they have to do with each other? And then I'll have you lay out what's the Trump plan on those two categories and how we're doing.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：嗯，这两项技术我想都相对较新。因此，人们对它们有很多恐惧，而且我认为人们对它们的了解其实并不多。他们真的不知道该如何看待它们。我认为从政策角度来看，它们的处理方法有些不同，我们可以谈谈其中的异同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, there are two technologies that I guess are relatively new. And so there's a lot of fear of them and I think people don't actually know that much about them. They don't really know what to make of them. I think that from a policy standpoint and we can talk about the similarities and differences. The approaches are a little different.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币政策：从“通过执法监管”到寻求确定性

我认为对于加密货币，最需要的是监管的确定性。多年来，我与之交谈过的所有企业家都说同样的话，那就是“告诉我们规则是什么”。我们很乐意遵守，但华盛顿方面就是不告诉我们规则。事实上，在拜登执政期间，**SEC**（Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会，负责监管证券行业）的主席采取了一种被称为“通过执法进行监管”的方法，这基本上意味着你只会被起诉。他们不告诉你规则是什么，你基本上就是被起诉，然后其他人应该从你被起诉、罚款和监禁的过程中去揣测规则是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think with crypto, the main thing that's needed is regulatory certainty. You know, all the entrepreneurs I've talked to over the years, they all say the same thing, which is just tell us what the rules are. We're happy to comply, but people, you know, Washington won't tell us what they are. And in fact, during the Biden years, you had an SEC chairman who took an approach, which I guess has been called regulation through enforcement, which basically means you just get prosecuted. They don't tell you what the rules are. You just basically get indicted and then everyone else is supposed to divine what the rules are as you get prosecuted and fined and imprisoned.</p>
</details>

所以，这种方法持续了好几年。结果，整个加密行业都在向海外转移，我认为美国正在被剥夺这个未来的产业。因此，特朗普总统在去年的竞选活动中，在纳什维尔发表了一场现在很著名的演讲，他宣布将使美国成为全球的加密货币之都，并且他会解雇Gensler（Gary Gensler: 拜登政府时期的美国证券交易委员会主席）。这句是当时掌声最热烈的一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, that was the approach for several years. and as a result of that basically the whole crypto industry was in the process of moving offshore and America I think was being deprived of this industry of the future. And so President Trump during his campaign and last year he gave a now famous speech in Nashville in which he declared that he would make the United States the crypto capital of the planet and that he would fire Gensler. That was like the big applause line.</p>
</details>

主持人：我鼓掌了。他后来谈到，他很惊讶自己在那次演讲中获得了如此热烈的掌声。所以他又说了一遍，人群再次沸腾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I applauded. He's talked about how surprised he was at you know what a big ovation he got at that. So he said it again and you know the crowd erupted again.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：但无论如何，他承诺基本上会提供这种清晰度，以便这个行业能够理解规则并遵守。反过来，这应该能为消费者、企业以及生态系统中的每个人提供更大的保护，并使美国更具竞争力。所以我认为，在加密货币方面的任务，在某种程度上是支持监管的。我们基本上是希望建立起规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But in any event he promised basically to provide this clarity so that the industry would understand what the rules are be able to comply in turn that gives that should provide greater protection for consumers and businesses everyone who's part of the ecosystem. and it makes America more competitive. So I think that's sort of the mandate on crypto is in a way it's pro-regulation. It's basically we want to put in place regulations.</p>
</details>

### AI 政策：释放创新，赢得全球竞赛

在某种程度上，人工智能的情况恰恰相反。我认为拜登政府的做法过于严厉。他们甚至在不了解这个领域是什么的情况下就开始对其进行严格监管。他们没有，也没有人真正花时间去了解人工智能是如何被使用的，真正的危险是什么。当时存在着一种强烈的恐惧散播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In a way AI is kind of the opposite where I think the Biden administration was too heavy-handed. They were starting to really regulate this area without even understanding what it was. they weren't they had no one had really taken the time to understand how AI was even being used what the real dangers were there was this intense fear-mongering.</p>
</details>

结果，拜登政府的做法是，他们正在对软件和硬件两方面实施非常严厉的法规，我们可以深入探讨这一点。我认为在特朗普政府的领导下，我们的方针是希望美国赢得人工智能竞赛。这是一场全球竞争。我们有时会提到中国可能是我们在这个领域的主要竞争对手。他们是唯一拥有技术能力、人才、知识和专业技能来击败我们的国家。我们希望确保美国获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And as a result of that you know the approach of the Biden administration was they were in the process of of implementing very heavy-handed regulations on both the software and hardware side and we can drill into that. I think that with the Trump administration the approach has been that we want the United States to win the AI race. It's a global competition. Sometimes we mention the fact that China is our probably our main competitor in this area. They're the only other country that has the technological capability, the talent, the knowhow, the expertise to to beat us in this area. And we want to make sure the United States wins.</p>
</details>

当然，在美国，真正负责创新的不是政府，而是私营部门。这意味着我们的公司必须获胜。如果你对它们施加各种疯狂、繁重的规定，那只会伤害它们，而不是帮助它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And of course in the US it's not really the government that's responsible for innovation. It's the private sector. So that means that our companies have to win and if you're imposing all sorts of crazy burdensome regulation on them then that's going to hurt not help.</p>
</details>

因此，总统在几个月前的7月23日发表了一篇我认为非常重要的人工智能政策演讲，他毫不含糊地宣布我们必须赢得人工智能竞赛，并阐述了实现这一目标的几个支柱。它支持创新、支持基础设施，这也意味着支持能源和支持出口。如果你愿意，我们可以深入探讨所有这些事情，但那只是一个大概的纲要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the president gave a I think very important AI policy speech a couple months ago on July 23rd where he declared in no uncertain terms that we had to win the AI race and he laid out several pillars on how we do that. it was pro-innovation, pro infrastructure, which also means pro energy and pro export. And we can drill into all those things if you want, but that was sort of the high line.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，对于人工智能，核心思想是如何释放创新。而对于加密货币，则更多地是关于如何创造监管的确定性。但就我的角色而言，我为什么同时负责这两者？我认为共同点在于，这些都是新技术。它们都源于科技行业，而科技行业的文化与华盛顿截然不同。我把我的角色看作是帮助在硅谷发生的事情和华盛顿发生的事情之间架起一座桥梁，帮助华盛顿不仅理解所需的政策或正在发生的创新，还要从文化上理解，是什么让科技行业与众不同、独一无二，以及如何保护它免受政府过度严厉的干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so I think that, you know, again with with AI, the idea is kind of like how do we unleash innovation? And I think with crypto, it's been more about how do we create regulatory certainty. But you know, in terms of my role, like why am I doing both? I mean, I think the common denominator is just again, these are new technologies. They, you know, they're both obviously come from the tech industry, which has a very different culture than Washington does. And I kind of see it as my role to help be a bridge between what's happening in Silicon Valley and what's happening in Washington and helping Washington understand not just the policy that's needed or the innovation that's happening but also kind of culturally, what makes the tech industry different and special and and how that needs to be protected from government doing something excessively heavy-handed.</p>
</details>

### 监管之下的加密行业：比想象中更糟的困境

主持人：David，我们今天会重点讨论人工智能，但关于加密货币，我今年有一个有趣的经历。在大选之后，人们适应了政府的更迭。我与一些政界人士进行了讨论，他们以前是反加密货币的，现在正试图找到一个更明智的立场。还有一些金融服务行业的人，他们之前只是远远地观望，可能在没有真正了解情况的情形下参与了各种揭穿加密货币的活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, David, you know, we're going to talk a lot about AI today, but just on crypto, I've had this interesting experience this year kind of after the election, you know, kind of people adjusted to the change of government. And I've had this discussion with, you know, a number of people who, let's say, in politics who were previously anti-crypto, who have been, you know, trying to figure out how to kind of get to a more sensible position. And then also actually people in the financial services industry who kind of followed it from a distance, and maybe, you know, participated in the, you know, the various debunking things without really understanding what was happening.</p>
</details>

但他们的共同点是，他们会说：“Mark，我以前真的不明白情况有多糟糕。我基本上以为你们科技界的人只是在不停地抱怨，像个特殊利益集团一样在游说，做些常规操作。我以为那些恐怖故事，比如人们被起诉，企业家的房子被FBI突袭等等，都是编造出来的。现在回过头来看，我才发现，‘天哪，这比我想象的要糟糕得多。’”你是否有过这样的经历？当你身处其中，对所有发生的事情有了全面的了解后，你认为人们真的理解当时的情况有多糟糕吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh but the the common denominator has been they're like you know Mark I didn't really understand how bad it was. I basically thought you guys in tech were basically just whining a lot. And you know, pleading as a special interest, and kind of doing the normal thing. And I figured, you know, the horror stories were kind of made up, you know, of people getting prosecuted and, you know, entrepreneurs getting their houses raided by the FBI and, you know, like the whole panoply of things that, you know, that happened and like I didn't really I now in retrospect now that I now that I go back and look, I'm like, "Oh my god, this was actually much worse than I thought." What do you do you have that experience? And as you're in there and kind of as you now have like a complete view of everything that happens, like do you think people understand actually how bad it was?</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我认为这是一个很好的观点。我以前也并不真正了解。我们只是大概听说过。我们知道正在发生“去银行化”（debanking），顺便说一句，不仅是加密公司被去银行化，它们的创始人个人也被去银行化。所以，如果你是一家加密公司的创始人，你就无法开设银行账户。这是一个巨大的问题。你怎么交易？怎么付款？怎么给员工发工资？这基本上剥夺了你的生计，是一种非常极端的审查形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, I think it's a great point. I mean, I didn't really know either. You kind of heard generally I mean, we knew that there was debanking going on and and by the way, it wasn't just crypto companies that were being debanked, but their founders were being debanked personally. So, if you were the founder of a crypto company, you couldn't open a bank account. I mean, that's a huge problem. It's like how do you how do you transact? How do you make payments? um how do you pay people? I mean it basically deprives you of a livelihood. It's a very extreme form of censorship.</p>
</details>

所以这确实在发生。当然，还有SEC主导的所有起诉。所以，是的，情况真的很糟糕。我记得大概在三月份，我们在白宫举办了一次加密货币峰会，其中一位与会者说：“一年前，我认为我进监狱的可能性比来白宫的可能性更大。”所以，这对整个行业来说是一个非常重要的里程碑。他们从未得到过任何形式的认可。在白宫为这个行业举办活动，这个想法本身就……至少，我认为加密货币被视为非常不入流的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was definitely happening. And then of course you have all the the prosecutions that the SEC was behind. So yeah, it was it was really bad. I remember back in I think it was in March we had a crypto summit at the White House and one of the attendees said that you know a year ago I would have thought it was more likely that I'd be in jail than that I'd be at the White House. And so it was you know it was a really big milestone for for the industry. They had never ever received any kind of recognition like that. The idea that this was even a industry that you would do an event at the White House. I mean at a minimum I think crypto is seen as very déclassé.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，是的，这是一个巨大的转变。我们基本上已经制止了那种情况。而且这非常不公平，因为这些创始人想要遵守规则，但却没人告诉他们规则是什么。我认为这都是一个蓄意策略的一部分，目的就是把加密货币赶出海外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But in any event yeah no it's been a it's been a huge shift. I mean, we basically have have stopped that. And you know, it was very unfair because again, these founders wanted to comply with the rules, but they weren't told what they were. And that was all part of a deliberate strategy, I think, to drive crypto offshore.</p>
</details>

### AI 领域的“监管捕获”：一个更复杂的问题

主持人：是的。我们注意到，加密货币和人工智能之间有一个很大的不同之处：在加密货币领域，每个人都只是想要规则，整个行业相对团结。但在人工智能领域，我们看到了一些非常有趣的“内鬼”呼声，某些公司真的在寻求**监管捕获**（Regulatory Capture: 指监管机构本应为公众利益服务，但实际上却被其所监管的行业或利益集团所控制或影响的现象）。那些早期领先的公司说，让我们阻止所有新公司开发人工智能等等。你对此有何看法？你认为这会走向何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. One of the things that is very different between crypto and AI that we've noticed is that on the crypto front, everybody just wanted rules. and the industry was relatively unified. Whereas in AI, we've seen very like interesting kind of calls coming from inside the house with certain companies really going for regulatory capture. You know, people who have early leads saying let's cut off all new companies from developing AI and so forth. What do you make of that and and where do you think that's going?</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我认为这是一个非常大的问题。实际上，我最近批评了我们的一家人工智能模型公司，因为它采取了监管捕获的策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think it's I think it's a very big problem. I actually recently criticized one of our AI model companies for engaging in regulatory capture strategy.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

主持人：顺便说一句，这是非常公正的批评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Very fair criticism by the way.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：这非常公正。实际上，他们当然否认了，然后……我该讲这个故事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It is very fair and actually you know of course they denied it and then should I tell the story? I mean</p>
</details>

主持人：当然，很少有人能在 X（前身为 Twitter）上得到如此彻底和完全的证实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah sure rarely do you get vindicated on on X so so thoroughly and completely as I did on this because after this company it was basically anthropic after they denied it.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：因为在这家公司，基本上就是Anthropic，在他们否认之后，发生了什么呢？Anthropic的联合创始人兼政策负责人Jack Clark在一个会议上发表演讲，他把对人工智能的恐惧比作一个孩子在黑暗中看到怪物，或者认为黑暗中有怪物，但当你打开灯，怪物就在那里。我认为这是一个非常荒谬的比喻。这基本上是幼稚的，近乎于自我控诉，因为你基本上承认了这种恐惧是编造出来的，不是真实的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There was what basically happened is that Jack Clark who's a co-founder and head of policy philanthropic gave a speech at a conference where he said that he compared fear of AI to a child you know seeing monsters in the dark or thinking there were monsters in the dark and but then you turn the lights on and the monsters are there. I thought that was such a ridiculous analogy. I mean it's basically puerile. I mean, it's it's so childish just to be almost self-indicting because you're basically admitting the fear is made up, not real.</p>
</details>

无论如何，我当时说：“这就像是在散播恐惧，是他们监管捕获策略的一部分。”他们当然否认了。但后来，一位在场听他演讲的律师说：“是的，但Jack没有告诉你们他在问答环节说了什么。”他基本上承认了Anthropic所做的一切，比如像SB53法案这样表面上只是为了提高透明度的事情，他承认那只是他们实现真正目标的垫脚石。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In any event, so I said, "Well, this is like fear-mongering and part of their regulatory capture strategy." And of course, they denied it. But then a lawyer who was in the crowd at his speech said, "Well, yeah, but Jack's not telling you what he said during the Q&A, which he basically admitted that everything that Anthropic was doing was you know, with with like things like SB53, which is supposedly just implementing transparency." He said, "No, that's all that he admitted that was just a stepping stone to their real goal,</p>
</details>

他们的真正目标是在华盛顿建立一个预批准系统，在你发布新模型之前必须获得批准。他在问答环节承认，让人们感到非常害怕是他们策略的一部分。所以，这简直就是你在X上能找到的最确凿的证据了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> which was to get an approval, a system of pre-approvals in Washington before you can release new models." and he admitted as part of the Q&A that making people very afraid was part of their strategy. So again, just as much as a smoking gun as you could ever get in a spat on X.</p>
</details>

### “无需许可的创新”是硅谷成功的基石

我认为这种做法之所以如此具有破坏性，是因为过去几十年来，真正让硅谷与众不同的是**无需许可的创新**（Permissionless Innovation: 指创造者无需事先获得任何中央权威机构的批准或许可，即可开发和部署新技术的理念）。就是说，两个在车库里的人就可以追求他们的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But the reason why I think that that approach is so damaging is that the thing that's really made I think Silicon Valley special over the past several decades is permissionless innovation. Right? It's that two guys in a garage can just pursue their idea.</p>
</details>

他们或许能从天使投资人或风险投资公司那里筹集一些资金，这些人基本上是愿意赔光所有钱的。这些年轻的创始人，也可能是未来某个宿舍里的辍学生，他们能够自由地追求自己的想法。我认为这之所以只在硅谷发生，是因为你看看像制药、医疗、国防或银行这些高度管制的行业，你根本看不到多少创业公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you know, maybe they raise some capital from angels or VC firms. B basically people who are willing to lose all of their money and these are people who, you know, are young founders. They could also be, you know, it could be the the the future dropout in a dorm room and they're able just to pursue their idea. And the only reason that I think has happened in Silicon Valley whereas you look at in you know industries like I don't know like pharma or healthcare or defense or banking or these highly regulated industries where you just don't see a lot of startups is because</p>
</details>

因为它们都受到严格监管，这意味着你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能做事。我在华盛顿看到的情况是，批准制度的设立总是有原因的，但这些原因很快就不再重要。重要的是你的政府事务团队在官僚体系中游刃有余、搞定审批的能力有多强。而这并不是典型创业创始人擅长的事情。大公司会擅长这个，因为他们有资源，而这正是监管捕获的含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> they're all heavily regulated which means you have to go to Washington to get permission to do things. And the thing I've seen in Washington is just that, you know, the approvals get set up for reasons, but those reasons very quickly stop mattering. And it just matters like how good your government affairs team is at navigating through the bureaucracy and figuring out how to get those approvals. And it's not something that your typical startup founders are going to be good at. It's something that big companies get good at because they've got the resources and that's exactly what regulatory capture means.</p>
</details>

所以，硅谷成功的整个基础，它之所以能成为美国经济的皇冠明珠和世界其他国家羡慕的对象，我们看到所有其他国家都在尝试创建自己的硅谷，其原因就在于“无需许可的创新”。而现在正在针对人工智能考虑、讨论和实施的，是一个针对软件和硬件的审批系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the the whole basis of Silicon Valley success, the reason why it's really the the crown jewel of the American economy and the envy of the rest of the world. We see all these attempts by all these other countries to create their own Silicon Valley. The the reason that's the case is because of permissionless innovation. And what is being contemplated and discussed and implemented with respect to AI is an approval system for both software and hardware.</p>
</details>

这并非理论。在硬件方面，这已经发生了。拜登政府做的最后几件事之一，就是在其执政的最后一周，实施了所谓的“拜登扩散规则”，该规则要求地球上每一笔**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，是AI计算的核心硬件）的销售都必须获得政府的许可，也就是说要预先批准，除非它符合某些例外类别。但总的来说，其核心思想是，计算能力现在将成为一个需要许可和预先批准的类别。我们废除了这项规定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And this is not theoretical. This has already been happening on the the hardware side. One of the last things that the Biden administration did the last week the Biden administration was impose the so-called Biden diffusion rule which requires that every sale of a GPU on Earth be licensed by the government which is to say preapproved unless it fits into some category of exception but basically the overall idea is that you know compute is now going to be a licensed and and pre-approved category. We rescinded that.</p>
</details>

在软件方面，就像我说的，目标非常明确，就是从向政府和各州提交报告要求开始，然后逐步升级到你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能发布新模型。你知道，这会极大地减缓创新速度，降低美国的竞争力。这些审批可能需要几个月，甚至几年。当新芯片每年都在发布，而我们的许可证申请已经在审批流程中躺了两年，等到最终批准时，这些请求早就过时了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then on the the software side like I said I mean the goal very clearly is to start with these reporting requirements to the government to the states and then where that ramps up to is you have to go to Washington to get permission before you release a new model and you know it's this would drastically slow down innovation and make America less competitive. I mean, you know, these approvals can take months, they can take years. When models are when a new chip is released every year and we have licenses that have been sitting in the hopper for 2 years, I mean, the requests are obsolete by the time they finally get approved.</p>
</details>

对于模型来说更是如此，新模型的迭代周期大约是三到四个月。华盛顿的官僚机构对这项技术到底了解多少，能让他们有资格去批准它呢？但无论如何，这就是目前正在考虑的事情，我认为这对硅谷、对创新，乃至对美国的竞争力来说都将是一场灾难。我认为，如果我们采用这套规则，我们将在人工智能竞赛中输给像中国这样的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And that would be even more true with models where, you know, the the cycle time is, you know, like three or four months for a new model. I mean, you know, and and and what exactly is a bureaucracy in Washington going to know about this technology that, you know, that they're that they're going to be in a good position to to approve it. Any event, but this is what is being contemplated right now and I think it would be a disaster for for Silicon Valley, but also and for innovation, but therefore for American competitiveness and I think we will lose the AI race to countries like China if you know if this is if this is the set of rules that we have.</p>

### 算法歧视与“觉醒 AI”的奥威尔式风险

目前大约有1200项法案正在各州立法机构审议，旨在监管人工智能。其中25%集中在加利福尼亚、纽约、科罗拉多和伊利诺伊这四个主要的蓝州。已经有超过一百项措施获得通过。仅在加州，上个月就有三项法案签署成为法律。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> There's now something like 1,200 bills going through state legislators right now to regulate AI. 25% of them are in the top four blue states which are California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. Over a hundred measures have already passed. I think three of them just got signed in the last month in California alone.</p>
</details>

我来告诉你科罗拉多州的情况。实际上，科罗拉多州、伊利诺伊州和加利福尼亚州都实施了某种版本的所谓“算法歧视”法案。我认为这个概念的发展方向非常令人担忧。这个概念意味着，如果模型产生的输出对受保护群体产生了不成比例的负面影响，那么这就是算法歧视。而受保护群体的名单非常长，远不止通常的那几个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'll tell you just let me tell you what Colorado is actually Colorado, Illinois, and California have all done some version of a thing called algorithmic discrimination. um which I think is it's really troubling where where it's headed. What what this concept means is that if the model produces an output that has a disparate impact on a protected group then that is algorithmic discrimination and the list of protected groups is is very long. It's more than just the the the usual ones.</p>
</details>

例如，在科罗拉多州，他们将可能不精通英语的人定义为受保护群体。所以，我猜如果模型说了关于非法移民的坏话，那就基本上违反了法律。我不知道模型公司到底该如何遵守这项规定。按理说，歧视本身已经是违法的。所以如果你是一家企业，违反了民权法，实施了歧视，你已经要为此负责了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, for example, in Colorado, they've defined people who may not have English language proficiency as a protected group. So, I guess if the model says something bad about, you know, illegal aliens and that would be, you know, that would basically violate the law. I don't know exactly how model companies are even supposed to comply with this rule. I mean, presumably, presumably discrimination is already illegal. So if you're a business and you violate the civil rights laws and you engage in discrimination, you're already liable for that.</p>
</details>

如果你碰巧犯了那个错误，并且在过程中使用了任何工具，我们其实不需要去追究工具开发者的责任，因为我们已经可以追究做出那个决定的企业的责任了。但这些法律的全部目的就是针对工具本身。他们不仅让使用人工智能的企业承担责任，还让工具开发者承担责任。我甚至不知道工具开发者该如何预见这种情况，因为你怎么知道你的工具会被以各种方式使用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, there's no reason you know if if you happen to make that mistake and you use any kind of tool in the process of doing it, we don't really need to go after the tool developer because we can already go after the business that's made that decision. But the whole purpose of of these laws is to get at the tool. They're making not just the the business that is using AI liable, they're making the tool developer liable. And I don't even know how the tool developer is supposed to anticipate this because how do you know all the ways that your tool is going to be used?</p>
</details>

你怎么知道这个输出，特别是当这个输出是100%真实和准确，并且模型在正常工作时，你怎么知道这个输出被用作一个产生差异化影响的决策的一部分？尽管如此，你还是要承担责任。我能想到的模型开发者唯一能尝试遵守这一规定的方法，就是在他们的模型中内置一个**DEI**（Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元、公平和包容）层，试图预测“这个答案是否会产生差异化影响？”如果会，我们要么不能给你答案，要么必须对答案进行净化或扭曲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How do you know that this output, you know, especially if the output is 100% true and accurate and the model is doing its job? you know then how are you supposed to know that that was that output was used as part of a decision that had a disparate impact? Nevertheless, you're liable. And the only way that I can see for model developers to even attempt to comply with this is to build a DEI layer into their models that tries to anticipate could this answer have a disparate impact? And if it does, we either can't give you the answer. We have to sanitize or distort the answer.</p>
</details>

你把这个推到逻辑的尽头，我们又回到了“觉醒AI”（woke AI）的问题上，顺便说一句，这曾是拜登政府的一个主要目标。我们废除的那份拜登关于人工智能的行政命令，其中有大约20页的DEI语言。他们非常努力地在模型中推广他们所谓的“DEI价值观”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you know, you just take this to its logical conclusion and we're back to, you know, woke AI, which by the way was a major objective of the Biden administration. That that Biden executive order on AI that we rescended as part of the Trump administration had something like 20 pages of DEI language in it. They were very much trying to promote DEI values, they called it, in models.</p>
</details>

我们已经看到了这样做的结果。我们看到了那个“黑人乔治·华盛顿”事件，历史被实时改写，因为有人在模型中内置了一个DEI层。我几乎觉得“觉醒AI”这个词不足以解释正在发生的事情，因为它在某种程度上把问题简单化了。我们真正谈论的是奥威尔式的AI。我们谈论的是会向你撒谎、扭曲答案、为了服务于当权者当前的政治议程而实时改写历史的AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And and we saw what the result of that was. you know, it was, you know, we saw the whole black George Washington thing where history was being rewritten in real time because somebody built, you know, a DEI layer into the model. And I, you know, and I I almost feel like the term woke AI is insufficient to explain what's going on because it somehow trivializes it. I mean, what we're really talking about is Orwellian AI. You know, we're talking about AI that that lies to you, that that distorts an an answer that rewrites history in real time to serve a current political agenda of the people who are in power.</p>
</details>

这非常奥威尔式，而在特朗普总统当选之前，我们无疑正走在这条路上。这是拜登行政命令的一部分，我们在第一代Gemini模型的发布中看到了这一点。那些扭曲的输出不是偶然的，它们是有来源的。所以对我来说，这才是人工智能最大的风险。它不是詹姆斯·卡梅隆描述的那样，而是乔治·奥威尔描述的那样。在我看来，不是《终结者》，而是《1984》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, it's it's very Orwellian and and we were definitely on that path before President Trump's election. It was part of the Biden EO. We saw it happen, you know, in in the release of that first Gemini model. that was not an accident that you know that those distorted outputs came from somewhere. So it was you know to just to me this is the the biggest risk of AI actually is it's not it was not described by James Cameron it was described by George Orwell you know it's in my view it's not the Terminator it's 1984.</p>
</details>

随着人工智能吞噬互联网，成为我们在线互动和获取信息的主要方式，它将被当权者用来控制我们接收的信息。它将包含意识形态偏见，基本上会审查我们。所有为社交媒体创建的“信任与安全”机制都将被移植到这个新的人工智能世界。Mark，我知道你对此谈过很多，我认为你完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That as AI eats the internet and becomes the main way that we interact and get our information online that it'll be used by the people in power to to control the information we receive. It'll contain an ideological bias that essentially it'll censor us. All that trust and safety apparatus that was created for social media will be ported over to this new world of AI. Mark, I know that you've spoken about this quite a bit. I think you're absolutely right about that.</p>
</details>

除此之外，还有监控问题。人工智能将了解你的一切，它会成为你的个人助理。所以它对政府来说，是监控和控制你的完美工具。对我而言，这绝对是人工智能最大的风险，也是我们应该努力防止的事情。问题是，很多由这些散播恐惧的手段催生出来的法规，实际上是在授权政府进行这种我们都应该非常害怕的控制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then on top of that, you've got the surveillance issues where, you know, AI is going to know everything about you. It's going to be your kind of personal assistant. And so it's kind of the perfect tool for the government to monitor and control you. And to me that is by far the biggest risk of of AI. And that's the thing we should be working towards preventing. And the problem is a lot of these regulations that are being whipped up by these fear-mongering techniques, they're actually empowering the government to to engage in this type of control that I think we should all be very afraid of.

### 戳破 AGI 泡沫：回归现实的“金发姑娘”情景

主持人：Sam Altman本周早些时候表示，他预计到2028年将拥有自动化的研究人员。我很好奇你对人工智能模型开发或整体进展的看法是什么？你认为这意味着什么？有些人一直在说**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能，指拥有与人类相当或超越人类智慧的AI）两年内就会到来，比如那些关于AI 2027的论文，以及Leopold Aschenbrenner的“态势感知”论文。我很好奇你对当前人工智能发展状况的解读以及其潜在影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sam Altman earlier this week said that in 2028 or by 2028, he expects to have automated researchers. I'm curious just for your sort of state of of AI sort of model development or or just progress in general and what do you think are the implications? Some people have been sort of, you know, saying that, you know, AGI is two years away, sort of the AI 2027 papers, the old Ashen Brener's situational awareness papers. I'm curious kind of what's your reading of the of the state of play in terms of a AI development and what are the implications from that?</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我的感觉是，硅谷的人们正在从所谓“AGI迫在眉睫”的叙事中退后。我看到Andrej Karpathy接受采访时，他突然改写了这种说法，说AGI至少还有十年之遥。他基本上是说，强化学习有其局限性。它非常有用，是目前取得很大进展的主要范式。但他说，实际上人类学习的方式并非真正通过强化。我们做的事情有些不同，我认为这是件好事，因为这意味着人类和人工智能将是协同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, so my sense is that people are in Silicon Valley are kind of pulling back from the let's call it imminent AGI narrative. I saw Andrej Karpathy gave an interview where all of a sudden he's he's rewritten this and he says AGI is at least a decade away. He's basically saying that reinforcement learning has its limits. I mean it's it's very useful. It's the main paradigm right now that they're making a lot of progress with. But he says that actually the way that humans learn is not really through reinforcement. We do something a little different which I think is a good thing because it means that human and AI will be synergistic, right?</p>
</details>

如果人工智能的理解是基于强化学习（RL），那它会与我们的直觉和推理方式有些不同。但无论如何，我感觉到人们正在从这种“AGI迫在眉睫”的叙事中退后。那种认为AGI两年内就会到来的想法，当然，人们对AGI的定义也不清楚，但它被用在一种可怕的方式中，好像它是一种会超越我们控制的超级智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. I mean the the AI's understanding if it's based on RL will be a little different than the way that we intuit it and and reason. Uh but in any event, I I sense more of a pullback from this imminent AGI narrative. Um you know, the idea that AGI is two years away. Of course, it's like kind of unclear what people mean by AGI, but it's kind of, you know, it was used in this like scary way that it's kind of the super intelligence that would grow beyond our control.</p>
</details>

我觉得人们正在从那种看法中退后，并开始理解，是的，我们仍在取得很大进展，而且进展惊人，但同时，我们所说的“智能”是多方面的，并非在每个维度上都在取得进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I feel like people are pulling back from that and understanding that yes we're still making a lot of progress and the progress is amazing but at the same time you know what we mean by intelligence is multifaceted and it's not like you know there's progress being made along some dimensions but it's not along every dimension.</p>
</details>

因此，我实际上把我们现在所处的状况描述为一种“金发姑娘”情景（Goldilocks scenario，指恰到好处、不过分也不欠缺的状态）。两个极端情况是，一边是可怕的《终结者》情景，即迫在眉睫的超级智能将超越我们的控制；另一边是你在媒体上经常听到的叙事，即我们正处在一个巨大的泡沫中，整件事都是假的。媒体基本上在同时推动这两种叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so therefore I think again I would just I mean I've described actually the situation we're in right now as a little bit of a Goldilocks scenario where the extremes would be you know you kind of have the the scary Terminator situation imminent super intelligence that'll grow beyond our control on the other the other narrative you hear in the press a lot is that we're in a big bubble. So in other words the whole thing is fake and the media is basically pushing both narratives at the same time.</p>
</details>

但我认为，真相更居于中间。这是一种“金发姑娘”情景，我们看到了大量的创新，我认为进展令人印象深刻，经济将因此获得巨大的生产力提升。但我喜欢Balaji Srinivasan最近的观察，有几点真的触动了我。其一，人工智能是多神论的，而非一神论的。意思是，我们看到的不是一个全知全能的神，而是许多更小、更专业的“神祇”或模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um, but any event, I think that the truth is is more in the middle. It's kind of a Goldilocks scenario where we're seeing a lot of innovation. I think the the progress is impressive. Uh it's I think we're going to see big productivity gains in the economy from this. But I like the observations that Balaji made recently where he said there's a couple of things that really struck me. One was AI is polytheistic, not monotheistic. Meaning what we're seeing is many instead of just one all-knowing all powerful god. What we're seeing is a bunch of smaller deities more specialized models.</p>
</details>

我们还没有走上那种递归式自我改进的轨道，但我们看到许多不同类型的模型在不同领域取得进展。另一个观察是，人工智能是“中段到中段”（middle to middle），而人类是“端到端”（end to end），因此两者关系是相当协同的。我认为这是对的。所有这些观察都与我对现状的感受产生了共鸣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you know it's it's not that sort of we're not on that kind of recursive self-improvement uh track just yet but you know we're seeing many different kinds of models make progress in different areas. And then the other the other one was just his observation that AI was was middle to middle whereas humans are end to end and therefore the relationship is is pretty synergistic and I think that's right. I mean I think I think all those observations are like resonate with me in terms of where we're at right now.</p>
</details>

### AI 的普及化：一个赋予个体力量的工具

主持人：是的，这与我们看到的情况非常一致。我们曾认为肯定会被大模型吞并的想法，现在正变成差异化极大的业务。这仅仅是因为宇宙的长尾非常长，你需要对某些场景有非常具体的理解才能构建一个有效的模型，事情就是这样发展的。没有哪个模型能搞定所有事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And that that that's very consistent with what we're seeing as well where um you know ideas that we thought would for sure get subsumed by the big models are becoming amazingly differentiated businesses. Um just because the fat tail of the universe is very fat and you need really kind of specific understanding of certain scenarios to build an effective model and that that's just how it's going. you know, no model has just like figured out how to do everything.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：是的，模型在有上下文的情况下工作得最好。我们都见过，你的提示越笼统，得到出色回应的可能性就越小。如果你对AI说一些非常笼统的话，比如“我能创办什么业务来赚十亿美元？”，它不会给你任何可操作的东西。你必须非常具体地说明你想做什么，它必须能接触到相关数据，然后它才能给你一些针对提示的具体答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, and the models work best when they have context, you know, and the more I mean, we've all seen this, the more general your prompt, the less likely it is that you're going to be able to get a great response. And I don't know, if you tell the AI something very general like what business can I create to make a billion dollars? it it's not going to give you something actionable. You know, you have to get very specific about what you're trying to do and it has to have access to relevant data and then it can give you some specific answers to to a prompt.</p>
</details>

我认为这部分印证了Balaji的观点，即AI不会自己提出目标。它需要被提示，需要被告知做什么。我们没有看到任何证据表明现阶段这种情况正在改变。在AI能自己提出目标方面，我们仍处于第零步。因此，模型必须被提示，然后它给你一个输出，而这个输出必须被验证。你必须以某种方式确保它是正确的，因为模型仍然可能出错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I think this is, you know, partly Balaji's point, which is, you know, the the the AI does not come up with its own objective. You know, it needs to be prompted. It needs to be told what to do. We've seen no evidence that that's at this stage that that's changing. we're still at step zero in terms of AI kind of, you know, somehow coming up with its own objective. And as a result of that, you know, the model has to be prompted and then it gives you an output and that output has to be validated. You have to somehow make sure it's correct because models can still be wrong.</p>
</details>

更有可能的是，你必须迭代几次，因为它不会完全给你你想要的东西。所以现在你得重新提示。我们都有过这种经历，对吧？这就是为什么聊天界面如此必要，因为它需要你迭代几次才能得到对你有价值的输出。再说一次，人类是端到端的，而AI是中段到中段的。我们没有看到任何证据表明这种基本动态正在改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And more likely you have to iterate a few times because it doesn't give you exactly what you want. So now you kind of reprompt and we've all had this experience, right? you this is why like the chat the chat interface is so is so necessary is because it takes you a few times to kind of iterate to get to the output that actually has value for you. Again you know humans are end to end and the the AI is middle to middle. I just don't you know we haven't seen any evidence that that fundamental dynamic is is changing.</p>
</details>

主持人：我想提一个与此相关但又有些独立的话题，那就是世界的未来会是由一个或少数几个公司、政府或超级AI拥有和控制一切吗？所有的价值都汇集到少数几个实体中。这样你就会陷入一种境地，要么是少数公司赚取所有钱的超级资本主义版本，要么是完全国家控制的超级共产主义版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The other thing I'd bring up related to this which is sort of this which I think is a little orthogonal but also quite related which is sort of is is the future of the world going to be one or a small number of companies or for that matter governments or super AIs that kind of own and control anything. And sort of all the value rolls up into a handful of of entities and and you know, and there you get into this there's like the hyper capitalist version of it where a few companies make all the money or there's like the hyper communist version of it where you have total state control or whatever.</p>
</details>

还是说，这是一种会扩散出去、掌握在每个人手中、成为赋权、创造力和个人努力的工具的技术？我认为这个时期一个非常引人注目的事情是，在你担任这个角色期间，第二种情况正在非常清晰地展现出来。那就是，现在正是人工智能实际上在超速民主化的时期。我认为人工智能实际上已经超速民主化了。它在最短的时间内传播给了比历史上任何新技术都多的个人，无论是在国内还是在全世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Or is this a technology that's going to diffuse out and be like in everybody's hands and be a tool of empowerment and creativity and individual effort, you know, expressiveness and and as a tool for basically everybody to use. I think one of the really striking things about this period of time and you being in this role is that this this is the period in which the scenario number two is very I think very clearly playing out which is that this is the time in which AI is actually hyperdemocratizing. I think actually AI is actually hyperdemocratized. It has spread to more individuals both in the country and around the world in the shortest period of time of any new technology I think in history.</p>
</details>

我们现在大约有6亿用户，并且正在迅速接近10亿，然后是50亿，遍及所有消费产品。而且世界上最好的人工智能就在这些消费产品中。所以如果你使用现在的ChatGPT或Grok或任何这些东西，我花再多的钱也无法获得更好的人工智能。它就在消费产品里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you know, we're we're it's something like 600 million, you know, users today on on rapidly on the way to a billion, rapidly on the way to to 5 billion, you know, kind of across all the all the consumer products. And then and then the best AIs in the world are are in the consumer products, right? And so if you use the if you use, you know, current day ChatGPT or Grok or any of these things like, you know, I I I can't spend more money, you know, and and get access to better AI. It's it's it's in the consumer products.</p>
</details>

所以实际上，你看到的是这项技术正在实时地掌握在每个人手中。每个人都将能够用它来优化他们所做的事情，让它成为思想伙伴，成为创建公司、创业或创作艺术的助手。我妻子今天早上就用它为我们10岁的孩子设计了一个新的创业课程。你知道，这就像，“哇，这真是个好主意。”她花了两三个小时，就为他制定了一个完整的课程，让他可以开始他的第一个视频游戏公司，里面包含了所有他需要学习的技能和所有资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so just in practice, what you have like playing out in real time is this technology is going to be in everybody's hands. And everybody is going to be able to use it to optim, you know, optimize the things that they do. Have it be a thought partner. Have it be, you know, somebody, you know, an assistant for for for building companies, you know, starting companies or creating art or, you know, doing all the things that people want to do. My wife was just using it this morning to design a new an entrepreneurship curriculum for our 10-year-old, right? Like, you know, like literally it's like, oh, wow, that's like a really great idea. And it took her a couple hours and she has like a full curriculum for him to be able to start his first video game company and here's all the different skills that he needs to learn and here's all the resources and and like that's just a level of capability.</p>
</details>

如果没有这些现代消费级AI工具，要做到这一点，你可能得去雇一个特殊教育专家之类的，这基本上是不可能的。现在每个人在他们的生活和他们认识的人当中都有这样的故事。所以我们有大量的证据表明，这条路走下去，这项技术将掌握在每个人手中，而且这实际上会是一件非常好的事情。David，我认为你们正在为实现这一点发挥关键作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean to to to you know to have done that without without these modern consumer AI tools you know you'd have to go like hire a you know special ed education specialist or something you know which is basically impossible to do that kind of thing. So and and you know everybody has these stories now in their lives among people they know. So we're we have the I I think we have like a lot of proof that the the track that this on is that this is going to be in everybody's hands and in fact that is going to be a really good thing and and and I think and I think David I think you guys are really playing a key role in making making it happen.</p>

### 开源 AI 的重要性与中美竞争格局

David Sacks：我认为这项技术保持去中心化非常重要，因为那种奥威尔式的担忧是终极的中心化。幸运的是，到目前为止，我们在市场上看到的是高度竞争。有五家主要模型公司都在进行巨额投资。模型的基准测试、性能评估都相对集中，并且有很多蛙跳式超越的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think it's so important that this technology remain decentralized because the kind of the Orwellian concern is kind of the ultimate centralization. And fortunately so far what we're seeing in the market is that it's hyper competitive. There's five major model companies all making huge investments. And the the the benchmark the the the model performance the evaluations are relatively clustered and there's a lot of leapfrogging going on.</p>
</details>

比如，Grok发布新模型，超越了ChatGPT，但接着ChatGPT发布新东西，又反超回来。所以它们都非常有竞争力，彼此非常接近。我认为这是件好事。这与通过“AGI迫在眉睫”的故事所预测的恰恰相反。那个故事的说法是，一个模型会取得领先，然后它会利用自己的智能来让自己变得更好，因此它的领先优势会越来越大，你就会得到这种递归式的自我改进，很快就走向奇点了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, you know, Grok releases new model, it leapfrogs ChatGPT and but then ChatGPT releases something new, they they leap frog. So they're all like very competitive and close to each other. And I think that's a that's a good thing. And it's the opposite of what was predicted, you know, through this like imminent AGI story where the the the sort of the the storytelling there was that one model would get a lead and then it would direct its own intelligence to making itself better and then so therefore its lead would get bigger and bigger and you kind of get this recursive self-improvement and pretty soon you're off to the the singularity.</p>
</details>

我们并没有真正看到这种情况。我们没有看到一个模型在能力上完全甩开其他模型。我认为这是件好事。所以，Eric，关于你提到的虚拟AI研究员的说法，那是“AGI迫在眉睫”叙事的一个变体，即步骤是：模型变得更聪明，然后模型创造出虚拟AI研究员，然后你得到一百万个虚拟AI研究员，然后就是奇点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And we haven't really seen that, you know, we haven't seen one model completely pull away in terms of capabilities. And I think that's a a good thing. And so Eric to your point about this narrative about the virtual AI researcher that that was one variant of this sort of imminent AGI narrative is that the steps would be you know models get smarter then models create virtual AI researcher and then you get a million virtual AI researchers and then you know it's singularity.</p>
</details>

我认为这其中的障眼法在于，“虚拟AI研究员”是什么？说起来很容易，但它到底意味着什么？Toby（可能是指 Balaji）关于AI仍然是“中段到中段”而不是“端到端”的观点很重要。如果一个AI研究员是端到端的，那么它必须自己解决一些问题，设定自己的目标，能够以AI无法做到的方式进行转向。创造一个虚拟AI研究员真的可行吗？我认为AI可以在工作的某些部分做得很好，甚至比人类更好，但这个工具可能还是需要由一个人类AI研究员来使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I think just the slight of hand in that is what is a virtual AI researcher right it's like a very easy thing to say, but like what does that really mean? And you know, Toby's point about um you know, AI is still middle to middle. It doesn't it's not end to end. So if an AI researcher is end-to-end, there's like things that has to you things the person has to figure out. They've got to set their own objective. They've got to be able to pivot in ways that AI can't. Um you know, like is it really is that really feasible to create a virtual AI researcher? I think there's like parts of the job that you know AI could get really good at or even better than humans, but probably that tool has to be used by a human AI researcher.</p>
</details>

所以我怀疑这个论点可能是目的论的，也就是说，你可能需要AGI才能创造出虚拟AI研究员，而不是反过来。如果是这样，你就不会得到奇点。所以我对那个说法有点怀疑。Sam说他能在2028年做到，我们拭目以待吧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> So I guess the the the the the argument I suspect could be sort of teleological in the sense that you might need AGI to create a virtual AI researcher as opposed to the other way around. And if that's the case, you don't just, you know, you're not going to get like singularity. So, I'm a little bit skeptical of that claim. Um, you know, we'll see. What Sam say he could do it in 2028. I mean, I guess we'll see.</p>
</details>

主持人：David，你和本届政府也一直非常支持开源人工智能，我认为这也与市场竞争激烈这一点相吻合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> David, you've also you and the administration I think have also been very supportive of open source AI which I think also dovetails into this in terms of the market being very competitive.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

主持人：你愿意花点时间谈谈你们在这方面做了什么，以及你们是如何看待这个问题的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you want to spend a moment on what you guys have been able to do on that and how you think about it?</p>
</details>

David Sacks：是的，开源非常重要，因为我认为它等同于自由，软件自由。你基本上可以在自己的硬件上运行自己的模型，并保留对自己信息的控制权。顺便说一句，这是企业一直在做的事情。全球大约一半的数据中心市场是本地部署的，意味着企业和政府建立自己的数据中心，他们不依赖大型云服务商。我并非对超大规模云服务商有任何意见，只是人们喜欢运行自己的数据中心，并保持对自己数据的控制。我认为在某种程度上，这对消费者也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean so so just to the you open source is very important because I just think it's synonymous with um you know freedom I mean software freedom. You basically could run your own models on your own hardware and retain control over your own information. And by the way this is what enterprises typically do all the time is you know um about half the global data center market is you know is on prem meaning enterprises and governments create their own data centers. they don't go to the big clouds and by the way I've got nothing against the hyperscalers but just you know people like to run their own um you know own data centers and you know maintain control over their own data and that kind of thing and I think that will be true for consumers to some degree as well.</p>
</details>

所以，我确实认为这是一个我们应该鼓励和推广的重要领域。目前市场上的讽刺之处在于，最好的开源模型是中国的。这有点奇怪，对吧？这与你的预期相反。你可能期望美国体系会促进开放，而中国体系会促进封闭。但结果有点反过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So I do think it's an important area that we should you know want to encourage and promote the irony right now in the market is that um is that uh the best open source models are Chinese. Uh, and it's it's sort of a quirk, right? It's it's the opposite of what you'd expect. You'd expect like the American system would promote open and somehow the Chinese system would promote closed. That has kind of um, you know, ended up being a little backwards.</p>
</details>

我认为这背后有很好的理由。这可能只是一个历史偶然，比如DeepSeek的创始人非常致力于开源，所以事情就那样开始了。或者，这可能是一个深思熟虑的策略的一部分。如果你是中国，并且正在努力追赶，开源是一个非常好的方法，因为你可以让所有不结盟的开发者都愿意帮助你的项目，而这是封闭项目做不到的。所以这是一个很好的追赶策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think there's like good reasons for it. Uh, it could just be it could just be kind of a historical accident. the fact that the Deep Seek founder was like very committed to open source and kind of just kind of that like got things started that way or it could be part of a deliberate strategy. Uh if you're China and you're trying to catch up, open source is a really good way to do that because you get all the non-aligned developers to want to help your project which they can't do if you know with a closed project. So it's a great strategy for catching up.</p>
</details>

另外，如果你认为你的商业模式，无论是作为一家公司还是一个国家，是规模化制造硬件，那么你就会希望软件部分是免费或廉价的，因为它是你的互补品。所以你会试图商品化你的互补品。我不知道这是偶然还是设计的一部分，但这似乎就是中国的策略。我认为美国对此的正确回应是鼓励我们自己的开源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then also if you think that your business model you know as a company or as a country is let's say scale manufacturing of hardware then you'd want the the software part to be free or cheap because it's your compliment right so you try to commoditize your compliment and I don't know whether it's by accident or part of design that that seems to be what the Chinese strategy has been I think that the the right answer for the US in this is to you know to encourage encourage our own open source.</p>
</details>

如果我们能看到更多开源项目启动，那将是一件很棒的事情。我猜有一个很有前途的项目叫做Reflection，是由前谷歌DeepMind的工程师创立的。所以我希望我们能在西方看到更多的开源创新。但我认为这非常重要，是至关重要的。在我看来，它等同于自由，绝对不是我们想要压制的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, we I think it'd be a great thing if we saw more open source initiatives get get going. I guess there's one promising one called um Reflection, which um was founded by former um you know, engineers from uh from Google Deep Mind. Uh so I hope we see more open source innovation in in the west. But um but look, I think it's it's very important. is critical and like I said I in my view it's synonymous with with freedom and it's definitely not something we want to suppress.</p>
</details>

现在回到封闭生态系统。确实，我们有五个主要竞争者，他们都在投入大量资金。我确实有点担心，在某个时间点，市场会整合，我们最终会像在其他技术市场看到的那样，出现垄断或双头垄断。我们在搜索领域看到了这种情况。我只是认为，如果这个市场能保持比只有一两个赢家更具竞争性，那会更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now just back to the the closed ecosystem for a second. It's true we have five major competitors there and they're all spending a lot of money. I do worry a little bit that at some point some point in time that the model consol not the model the um the market consolidates and we end up with you know like a monopoly or duopoly or something like that as we've seen in other technology markets. We saw this with search and you know and so on down the line. And I just think that it would be good if this market stayed more competitive than just one or two winners.</p>
</details>

我真的不知道该怎么做，我只是提出这个观察。我确实认为，拥有开源作为一个选项，可以确保即使市场真的整合了，你仍然有一个替代方案。而且这个替代方案更完全在你的控制之下，而不是受制于一个大公司，或者像我们在“推特档案”中看到的那样，深层政府与那家公司合作。深层政府与所有这些社交媒体公司合作，实施了比我们任何人想象的都更广泛的审查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't really know what to do about that. I'm just making that observation. And I I do think that having open source as an option always then ensures that even if the market does consolidate that you do have an alternative and it's an alternative that's more fully within your control as opposed to a large corporation or um you know or or the deep state you know working with that corporation as we saw in the Twitter files that you know the deep state was working with all these um you know social media companies um you know in in implementing much more widespread censorship than I think we any of us thought possible.</p>
</details>

### 赢得 AI 竞赛的三大支柱

主持人：Peter Thiel多年前曾说过，他认为加密货币将是自由主义的或去中心化的，而人工智能将是共产主义的或中心化的。我想我们可能学到的一件事是，技术并非决定论的，有一系列选择决定了这些技术是去中心化还是中心化的。也许我们可以以此为契机，更深入地探讨与中国的竞赛状况。David，也许你可以阐述一下，什么是需要做对的最重要的事情。你已经指出了开源是一个例子，之前也提到了我们关于芯片的策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The um Peter Thiel quipped, you know, many years ago that he thought, you know, crypto would be libertarian or decentralizing and that uh AI would be communist or or centralizing. And I think one thing we've perhaps we've learned that uh technology isn't deterministic and that there are a set of choices that determine whether these technologies are decentralizing or or centralizing. And um maybe we could segue use that as a segue to go deeper into the the state of the race with China. Uh maybe David you could lay out the sort of the what's most important to to get right. You've already indicated you know open source is one example. Um you know you you alluded earlier to sort of our strategy as relates to chips.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：是的。所以，当我们谈论赢得AI竞赛时，有时我们说是在与中国竞赛，有时我们说得更模糊一些，因为我认为我们不应该过分执着于我们的竞争对手或对手。我认为我们是否能赢，主要取决于我们对自己技术生态系统所做的决定，而不是我们对他们做了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, you know, when we talk about winning the AI race, um, sometimes we say we're in a race against China, sometimes we just leave it a little bit more vague because I I don't think we should become overly obsessed with our uh, competitors or adversaries. I think whether we win or not will mostly have to do with the decisions we make about our own technology ecosystem, not about, you know, what we do v visa v them.</p>
</details>

总统在他7月23日关于AI政策的演讲中，提到了我们如何赢得这场AI竞赛的几个关键支柱。顺便说一句，我不是说它会结束，这可能是一场无限的游戏，但我们至少要处于领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so the president in in his July 23rd speech on AI policy, I think mentioned a few of the key pillars of of, you know, of of how we win this this AI race. Um, and by the way, I'm not saying it ever ends. This it might be an infinite game, but um but we want to be in the lead at least.</p>
</details>

我提到的几个关键支柱：第一是创新。支持私营部门非常重要，因为他们是创新的主体。我们不可能通过监管来战胜我们的对手，我们必须通过创新超越他们。我认为目前最大的障碍是各州过度监管的狂热。我迫切地认为我们需要一个单一的联邦标准。一个由50个不同监管制度组成的拼凑体，遵守起来将是极其繁重的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In terms of how we win this race, I mentioned a few of the key pillars. Number one is innovation. You know it's very important to support the private sector because they're the ones who do the innovation. We're not going to regulate our way to beating our our adversary. We just have to out innovate them. I mentioned I think right now the biggest obstacle is the the frenzy of overregulation happening at the states. I desperately think we need a federal a single federal standard. A patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes is going to be incredibly burdensome to comply with.</p>
</details>

我认为，拥有一个单一的全国市场是美国最伟大的优势之一，这对我们的竞争力至关重要。这就是为什么美国的赢家能够走向世界。我们必须保持这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think one of America's greatest advantages is that we have a large national market, right? Not 50 separate state markets. The fact that we have a single national market is just fundamental to our competitiveness and it's why you know winners in America then go on to kind of win the whole world. So we have to preserve that and I think we will eventually get some some federal preemption.</p>
</details>

第二个重要领域是基础设施和能源。我们希望帮助正在发生的这场惊人的基础设施建设热潮。我认为最大的限制因素将是能源。我认为特朗普总统在这方面非常有远见。他多年前就在谈论“钻探吧，宝贝，钻探吧”（Drill, baby, drill）。他明白能源是一切的基础，也绝对是这次AI热潮的基础。我们希望扫清所有不必要的法规、许可限制和大量的**邻避主义**（NIMBYism, Not In My Backyard: 指居民因担心项目对自身造成负面影响而反对新项目建设的现象），以便AI公司能够建造数据中心并为其供电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Second big area is infrastructure, you know, and energy. You know, we want to help this this amazing infrastructure boom that's happening. And the biggest, I think, limiting factor there is just going to be around energy. I think President Trump's been incredibly far-sighted in this. I mean, he was talking about drill baby drill many years ago. He understood that energy is the basis for everything. It's definitely the basis for this AI boom. And we want to basically get all of these unnecessary regulations, the permitting restrictions, a lot of the nimbyism out of the way so that AI companies can build data centers and get power for them.</p>
</details>

第三个领域是出口。这可能是最具争议的一个。它真正体现了硅谷和华盛顿之间的文化鸿沟。我认为硅谷的所有人都明白，赢得技术竞赛的方式是建立最大的生态系统。你让最多的开发者在你的平台上开发，你的应用商店里有最多的应用，每个人都用你的产品。那些通常获胜的公司是那些拥有所有用户、所有开发者的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then the third area is is around exports. And maybe this has been the most controversial one. And it really speaks to the cultural divide between Silicon Valley and and Washington. So, I think all of us in Silicon Valley understand that the way that you win a technology race is by building the biggest ecosystem, right? You get the most developers building on your your platform, you get the most apps in your app store, everyone just uses you. I mean, you know, those are the companies that typically win are the ones that get all the users, all the developers, and so on.</p>
</details>

所以我们硅谷有一种合作的心态。我们只想发布API，让每个人都来使用。而华盛顿有不同的心态，更像是一种命令与控制。我们希望你获得批准，我们想囤积这项技术，只有美国应该拥有它。我认为这正是“拜登扩散规则”的核心所在，那个规则的要点就是阻止扩散。“扩散”成了一个坏词。但在硅谷，我们明白扩散才是取胜之道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so we in Silicon Valley have a partnership mentality. You know, we want to just publish the APIs and get everyone using them. Uh Washington has a different mentality, right? It's much more of a command and control. We want you to get approved. Um you know, we kind of want to hoard this technology. Only America should have it. And and this this was really fundamental, I think, to the Biden diffusion rule where the the point of that rule is to stop diffusion, right? Diffusion is a bad word. But in Silicon Valley we understand that diffusion is how you win.</p>
</details>

我解析这个问题的方式是，我们决定卖给中国什么，这永远是复杂的，因为他们是我们的竞争对手和对手，还有潜在的军民两用问题。所以卖给中国什么是一个微妙的问题。但我们卖给世界其他地方什么，这应该是一个简单的问题，那就是我们应该希望与世界其他地方做生意。我们应该希望拥有尽可能大的生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The way I kind of parse it is that what we decide to sell to China is always going to be complicated because you know they're our competitor and our adversary and there's the whole potential dual use and so the question of what you sell to China is is nuanced. But what we sell to the rest of the world that should be an easy question which is we should want to do business with the rest of the world. We should want to have the largest ecosystem possible.</p>
</details>

我们每将一个国家排除在我们的技术联盟之外，基本上就是把他们推向中国的怀抱，这让中国的生态系统变得更大。我们在拜登执政期间看到的是，他们不断地把其他国家推向中国的怀抱，从2023年10月的海湾国家开始。基本上，像沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋这些长期以来的美国盟友，不被允许从美国购买芯片。换句话说，他们不被允许建立数据中心和参与人工智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and every country we exclude from our technology alliance were basically driving into the arms of China and it makes their ecosystem bigger and what we saw under the the Biden years is that they were constantly pushing other countries into the arms of China starting with the Gulf states in October of 2023. Basically the the Gulf States and I'm talking about countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, long-standing US allies, they weren't allowed to buy chips from the US. In other words, they weren't allowed to set up data centers and participate in in AI.</p>
</details>

我们告诉所有这些国家，人工智能对未来至关重要，它将是经济的基础，但我们却不允许你们参与美国的技术栈。很明显他们会怎么做。我们给他们的唯一选择就是去找中国。所以，所有这些规则基本上只是为中国的芯片和模型创造了被压抑的需求，并创造了一个华为版的“一带一路”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you know, here we are telling all these countries that, you know, AI is fundamental to the future. It's going to be the basis of the economy, and yet we're excluding you from participating in the American tech stack. Well, you know, it's obvious what they're going to do. You know, the only play we're giving them is to go to China. And so, you know, all of these rules basically just create pent-up demand for for Chinese chips and models. and it creates a Huawei belt and road.</p>
</details>

我们听说华为已经开始在中东和东南亚扩散。我只是觉得这是一个非常适得其反的策略。我们完全是在搬起石头砸自己的脚。最大的讽刺是，那些推动这种将所有国家推向中国怀抱的策略的人，自称为“中国鹰派”，好像他们做的事情是在伤害中国。不，这实际上是在帮助中国。这基本上就是把市场拱手相让。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And we are hearing that um that Huawei is starting to proliferate or diffuse in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia. And I just think it's a really counterproductive strategy. We're completely shooting ourselves in the foot. And like the the greatest irony is that the people who've been pushing this strategy of driving all these countries into China's arms have called themselves China hawks. you know, as if what they're doing is uh is hurting China. No, it's like it's it's helping China. I mean, it's basically just handing them markets.</p>
</details>

我们的产品更好。但如果你不给这些国家购买美国技术栈的选择，他们显然会选择中国的技术栈。中国正在推广Deepseek模型和华为芯片，他们可不会为是否向阿联酋出口用于数据中心的芯片会创造出“终结者”而伤脑筋。所有这些我们为不向朋友出售美国技术而编造的荒谬叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And our products are better. But if you don't give these countries a choice to buy the American tech stack, obviously they're going to go with the Chinese tech stack. And China China's out there promoting Deepseek models and Huawei chips and they're not like ringing their hands about you know whether exporting chips for a data center in UAE is going to like create the Terminator and you know all these like ridiculous narratives that we've invented to you know reasons we've invented not to sell American technology to our friends.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币法案的未来：从《GENIUS 法案》到《CLARITY 法案》

主持人：David，在我们还有时间的时候，快速回到加密货币的话题。本届政府和我认为整个国家，今年早些时候随着总统签署**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种价值与某种稳定资产，通常是美元，挂钩的加密货币）法案（即《GENIUS法案》）成为法律，取得了一项重大胜利。我想告诉你，我们看到那个法律的积极后果甚至比我们想象的还要大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. So David just to uh come back real quick while we still have you on on crypto. So the administration and I think the country had a significant victory uh earlier this year with the president signing the stablecoin bill into law uh which was the the genius act. And I I think that I'll just tell you what we see is like the positive consequences of that law have been even bigger than we thought.</p>
</details>

我想说，这不仅对稳定币行业如此，现在你实际上看到各种金融机构都在以一种前所未有的方式拥抱稳定币。这个现象正在美国蔓延，顺便说一句，我们在那里处于领先地位，做得很好。但更广泛地说，它向加密行业发出了一个信号，即这确实是一个新时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I would say that's both for the stable coin industry and you now see actually a lot of a lot of financial institutions of all kinds embracing stable coins in a way that that they weren't before. and you know sort of the the phenomenon spreading in America you know by the way doing you know being being in the lead and doing very well there. But but but just also more broadly just as a signal to the crypto industry that like this you know this really is a you know this really is a new day.</p>
</details>

真的会有监管框架让这些事情成为可能，这些框架是负责任的，但也让这个行业真正在美国蓬勃发展。如你所知，现在正在制定第二部立法，即市场结构法案，称为《CLARITY法案》，这是立法议程的第二阶段。我想知道你对那项法案重要性的看法，以及你认为那个过程进展如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And there really there really are going to be regulatory frameworks that that make these things possible and and you know that that are responsible but also make this industry really possible to flourish. and in the US as you know there's a second piece of legislation um you know being constructed right now which is the market structure bill uh called the the clarity act which is sort of the phase two of the legislative agenda and I wondered maybe if you could just tell us a little bit about your view of of the importance of that of that bill and and then you know kind of how do you think that process is going</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我认为这极其重要。正如你提到的，我们几个月前通过了《GENIUS法案》，但那只针对稳定币。稳定币大约占代币总市值的6%。所以94%是所有其他类型的代币，《CLARITY法案》将适用于所有这些，并为所有其他加密项目和公司提供监管框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think it's extremely important. So as you mentioned we we passed the the Genius Act few few months ago but that was just for stable coins stable coins are about 6% of the total market cap in terms of tokens. So 94% are all the other types of tokens and the Clarity Act would apply to all of that and provide the regulatory framework for all those other crypto projects and companies.</p>
</details>

你知道，如果我们能确定，我们现在有一位出色的SEC主席Paul Atkins，并且能确保像Paul Atkins这样的人永远在SEC，那么我们就不一定需要立法，因为他们已经在实施更好的规则并提供监管清晰度。但事实是，我们无法确定。如果你是一个正在决定在哪里建立公司的创始人，你希望未来10年、20年都有确定性。我们希望鼓励长期项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, if we could be sure that, you know, currently we have a great SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, and if we could be sure that Paul Atkins and a person like Paul Atkins was always at the SEC forever, then we wouldn't necessarily need legislation because they're already in the process of implementing like much better rules and providing regulatory clarity. But the truth is that we don't know for sure. And if you're a founder who's trying to make a decision now about where you're going to build your company, you want to have certainty for 10 years out, 20 years out. we want to encourage long-term projects.</p>
</details>

所以我再次认为，将规则法典化非常重要，首先是提供清晰度，然后确保它们有足够的稳定性，并将这些规则写入立法。这是提供长期稳定性的唯一方法。我认为我们会完成《CLARITY法案》。就像你提到的，它在众议院以大约300票通过，其中包括约78名民主党人，所以它是实质性的两党合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so again I think it's very important to to canonize the the the rules that that's first to provide the clarity and then to make sure there's enough stability around them and sort of canonize those rules in legislation. That's the only way that you provide that long-term stability. I think that we will get the Clarity Act done. Like you mentioned it passed the House with about 300 votes of about 78 Democrats. So it was substantially bipartisan.</p>
</details>

我认为它最终会通过。现在它正在参议院审议。我认为它最终会完成。我们正在与十几位民主党人谈判。我们必须达到60票。所以难点在于**冗长辩论阻挠**（filibuster: 参议院的一种议事程序，少数派议员可通过发表超长演说等方式来阻挠法案通过，需要60票才能终结辩论），我们必须达到60票。但我们正在与大约十几位民主党人谈判，我确实认为我们最终会达到那个数字。顺便说一句，我们在参议院为《GENIUS法案》获得了68票，包括18名民主党人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think it will ultimat we're it's now going through the Senate. Um I think it will ultimately get done. Uh we're negotiating with a dozen or so Democrat. We have to get to 60 votes. So that's the the hard part is under the filibuster. We got to get to 60. Uh so but we're negotiating with about a dozen Democrats. And I I do think that we will ultimately get to to that number. We by the way we ended up having 68 uh votes in the Senate for genius uh including 18 Democrats.</p>
</details>

所以我确实认为，即使我们只得到《GENIUS法案》民主党人票数的三分之二，我们在《CLARITY法案》上也会没问题。但这将为除稳定币之外的所有其他代币提供监管框架。我认为这是至关重要的立法。这最终将完成加密货币议程，我们从拜登的“加密战争”走向特朗普的“全球加密之都”。然后，我认为该行业将拥有所需的稳定性，可以专注于创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I do think that even if we just get, you know, two-thirds of the number of Democrats that we got for Genius, then, you know, we'll we'll be we'll be fine on on clarity. But I, you know, it this will provide the the regulatory framework again for all the other tokens besides stable coins. And I think it's just a critical piece of of legislation. And uh yeah, this this would ultimately I think kind of complete the crypto agenda where we've kind of you know moving from you know Biden's war on crypto to Trump's crypto capital of the planet. And then you know I think the industry will have the stability it needs and can just focus on innovating.</p>
</details>

### 结语：美国价值观的回归

主持人：我一直为自己是美国人而自豪，但现在尤其如此，因为我们谈论的很多事情，感觉就像我们正在重新聚焦于美国的核心价值观，这真的很棒。

</details>

David Sacks：是的。我的意思是，我们的观点是，首先我们必须赢得AI竞赛。我们希望美国在这个关键领域领先。这对我们的经济和国家安全至关重要。怎么做呢？我们的公司必须成功，因为他们是创新的主体。你不可能通过监管来赢得AI竞赛。我不是说我们不需要任何监管，但关键是，那不是决定我们是否成为赢家的因素。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean again it's you know our our view is that the first of all we have to win the I race. We want America to lead in this critical area. It's like fundamental for our economy and our national security. How do you do that? Well, our companies have to be successful because they're the ones who do the innovation. Again, you're not going to regulate your way to winning the AI race. I'm not saying we don't need any regulations, but the point is just that's not how that's not what's going to determine whether we're the winners or not.</p>
