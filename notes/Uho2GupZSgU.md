### 欧洲的“领导力”：在监管上领先

欧洲人对所有这些事情的心态确实非常不同。当他们谈论人工智能（AI）领导力时，他们指的是在制定法规方面取得领先。他们在布鲁塞尔开会，商讨所有规则应该是什么样的，而这就是他们所谓的领导力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Europeans, I mean, they have a really different mindset for all this stuff. When they talk about AI leadership, what they mean is that they're taking the lead in defining the regulations. You know, they get together in Brussels and figure out what all the rules should be. And that's what they call leadership.</p>
</details>

这几乎就像一个游戏节目。他们想尽一切办法将初创公司扼杀在摇篮里，如果这些小公司在经历十年的虐待后幸存下来，他们才会给钱让它们成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's almost like a game show or something. They do everything they can to strangle them in their crib and then if they make it through like a decade of abuse of small companies, then they're going to give them the money to grow.</p>
</details>

罗纳德·里根对此有一句名言：如果它在动，就给它征税；如果它还在动，就监管它；如果它不动了，就补贴它。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Ronald Reagan had a line about this, which is if it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it.</p>
</details>

欧洲人现在无疑处于“补贴它”的阶段。

### AI与加密货币：特朗普政府的不同策略

**主持人：** 大卫，欢迎来到 a16z 播客。感谢你的加入。你现在是人工智能和加密货币的负责人。你为什么不先谈谈，将这两个领域放在一个组合里为什么是合理的？它们之间有什么关系？然后，请你阐述一下特朗普在这两个类别上的计划以及我们目前的进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> David, welcome to the Asz podcast. Thanks for joining.
>> Yeah, good to be here.
>> So, David, you're the AI and cryptozar. Why don't you first talk about why it makes sense to have those as a portfolio? What do they have to do with each other? And then I'll have you lay out what's the what's the what's the Trump plan on those those two categories and how we're doing.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 嗯，这是两种相对较新的技术。因此，人们对它们有很多恐惧，而且我认为大家对它们的了解并不多，不知道该如何看待它们。从政策角度来看，它们的处理方法有些不同，我们可以谈谈其中的异同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, there are two technologies that I guess are relatively new. And so there's a lot of fear of them and I think people don't actually know that much about them. They don't really know what to make of them. I think that from a policy standpoint and we can talk about the similarities and differences. The the approaches are a little different.</p>
</details>

我认为对于加密货币，最需要的是监管的确定性。多年来，我交谈过的所有企业家都说同样的话，那就是：“告诉我们规则是什么就行了。”他们很乐意遵守，但华盛顿就是不告诉他们规则是什么。事实上，在拜登执政期间，**SEC**（U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会，负责监督证券行业）的主席采取了一种被称为“通过执法进行监管”的方法。这基本上意味着你不会被告知规则，只会被起诉。你基本上会被起诉，然后其他人应该从你被起诉、罚款和监禁的过程中推断出规则是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think with crypto, the main thing that's needed is regulatory certainty. You know, all the entrepreneurs I've talked to over the years, they they all say the same thing, which is just tell us what the rules are. were happy to comply, but people, you know, Washington won't tell us what they are. And in fact, during the Biden years, you had an SEC chairman who took an approach, which I guess has been called regulation through enforcement, which basically means you just get prosecuted. They don't tell you what the rules are. You just basically get indicted and then everyone else is supposed to divine what the rules are as you get prosecuted and fined and imprisoned.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币行业的困境与新希望

过去几年的方法就是这样。结果，整个加密货币行业都在向海外转移，我认为美国正在被剥夺这个未来产业。因此，特朗普总统在去年的竞选活动中，在纳什维尔发表了一场如今已是著名的演讲，他宣布将使美国成为全球的加密货币之都，并且他会解雇 Gensler（时任SEC主席）。这句是当时掌声最热烈的一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that was the approach for several years. and as a result of that basically the whole crypto industry was in the process of moving offshore and America I think was being deprived of this industry of the future. And so President Trump during his campaign and last year he gave a now famous speech in Nashville in which he declared that he would make the United States the crypto capital of the planet and that he would fire Gendler. That was like the big applause line.</p>
</details>

他后来谈到，他自己都惊讶于在那次演讲中获得了如此热烈的反响。于是他又说了一遍，人群再次沸腾。但无论如何，他承诺提供这种清晰度，以便行业能够理解规则并得以遵守，这反过来也应该为消费者、企业以及生态系统中的每一个人提供更大的保护，并使美国更具竞争力。所以我认为，在加密货币方面的任务，在某种程度上是支持监管的。我们基本上是希望建立起规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">he's talked about how surprised he was at you know what a big ovation he got at that. So he said it again and you know the crowd erupted again but in any event he promised basically to provide this clarity so that the industry would understand what the rules are be able to comply in turn that gives that should provide greater protection for consumers and businesses everyone who's part of the ecosystem. and it makes America more competitive. So I think that's sort of the mandate on on crypto is it in a way it's pro- regulation. It's basically we we want to put in place regulations.</p>
</details>

### AI领域的监管捕获与“无需许可的创新”

在某种程度上，人工智能的情况恰恰相反。我认为拜登政府的做法过于严厉。他们甚至在不了解这个领域是什么的情况下就开始对其进行严格监管。他们没有花时间去了解人工智能是如何被使用的，真正的危险是什么。当时存在着强烈的恐惧散播。结果，拜登政府的做法是，他们正在对软件和硬件两方面实施非常严厉的法规。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in a way AI is kind of the opposite where I think the B administration was too heavy-handed. They were starting to really regulate this area without even understanding what it was. they weren't they had no one had really taken the time to understand how AI was even being used what the real dangers were there was this intense fear-mongering and as a result of that you know the approach of the b administration was they were in the process of of implementing very heavy-handed regulations on both the software and hardware side and we can drill into that.</p>
</details>

我认为在特朗普政府的领导下，我们的方针是希望美国赢得人工智能竞赛。这是一场全球性的竞争。我们有时会提到中国可能是我们在这个领域的主要竞争对手。他们是唯一拥有技术能力、人才、知识和专业技能来击败我们的国家。我们希望确保美国获胜。当然，在美国，真正负责创新的不是政府，而是私营部门。这意味着我们的公司必须获胜，如果你对它们施加各种疯狂、繁重的监管，那只会伤害而不是帮助它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that with the Trump administration the approach has been that we want the United States to win the AI race. It's a global competition. Sometimes we mention the fact that China is our probably our main competitor in this area. They're the only other country that has the technological capability, the talent, the knowhow, the expertise to to beat us in this area. And we want to make sure the United States wins. And of course in the US it's not really the government that's responsible for innovation. It's the private sector. So that means that our companies have to win and if you're imposing all sorts of crazy burdensome regulation on them then that's going to hurt not not help.</p>
</details>

因此，总统在几个月前的7月23日发表了一次非常重要的人工智能政策演讲，他明确无误地宣布我们必须赢得人工智能竞赛，并阐述了实现这一目标的几个支柱：支持创新、支持基础设施（这也意味着支持能源）和支持出口。如果你愿意，我们可以深入探讨这些内容，但这就是大概的纲要。所以，我认为在人工智能方面，核心思想是如何释放创新。而在加密货币方面，则更多是关于如何创造监管的确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the president gave a I think very important AI policy speech a couple months ago on July 23rd where he declared in no uncertain terms that we had to win the AI race and he laid out several pillars on on how we do that. it was pro- innovation, pro infrastructure, which also means pro energy and pro export. And we can drill into all those things if you want, but that was sort of the the high line. And so I think that, you know, again with with AI, the idea is kind of like how do we unleash innovation? And I think with crypto, it's been more about how do we create regulatory certainty.</p>
</details>

至于我的角色，为什么我同时负责这两个领域？我认为共同点在于，这些都是新技术。它们都源于科技行业，而科技行业的文化与华盛顿截然不同。我把我的角色看作是帮助在硅谷发生的事情和华盛顿发生的事情之间架起一座桥梁，帮助华盛顿不仅理解所需的政策或正在发生的创新，还要从文化上理解，是什么让科技行业与众不同、独一无二，以及如何保护它免受政府过度严厉的干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but you know, in terms of my role, like what you know, why why am I doing both? I mean, I think the common denominator is just again, these are new technologies. They um, you know, they're both um, you know, obviously come from from the tech industry, which has a very different culture than Washington does. And I kind of see it as my role to help be a bridge between what's happening in Silicon Valley and what's happening in Washington and helping Washington understand not just the policy that's needed or or the innovation that's happening but also kind of culturally, you know, what what makes the tech industry different and special and and how that needs to be protected um from uh government doing something uh excessively heavy-handed.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我今年有过一次有趣的经历。在政府更迭后，我与一些政界人士进行了讨论，他们以前是反加密货币的，现在正试图找到一个更明智的立场。还有一些金融服务行业的人，他们之前只是远远地观望，可能在不真正了解情况的情形下参与了各种揭穿加密货币的活动。但他们的共同点是，他们会说：“马克，我以前真的不明白情况有多糟糕。我基本上以为你们科技界的人只是在不停地抱怨，像个特殊利益集团一样在游说。我以为那些恐怖故事，比如人们被起诉、企业家的房子被FBI突袭等等，都是编造出来的。现在回过头来看，我才发现，天哪，这比我想象的要糟糕得多。” 你有这样的经历吗？你认为人们真的理解当时的情况有多糟糕吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So David, you know, we're going to talk a lot about AI today, but just on crypto, I've had this interesting experience this year kind of after the election, you know, kind of people adjusted to the change of government. And I've had this discussion with, you know, a number of people who, let's say, in in politics who were previously anti-crypto, who have been, you know, trying to figure out how to kind of get to a more sensible position. Um, and then also actually people in the in the financial services industry who kind of followed it from a distance, and maybe, you know, participated in the, you know, the various debunking things without really understanding what was happening. Uh but the the common denominator has been they're like you know Mark I didn't really understand um how bad it was. Um, I basically thought you guys in tech were basically just whining a lot. Um, and you know, pleading as a special interest, and kind of doing the normal thing. And I figured, you know, the horror stories were kind of made up, you know, of people getting prosecuted and, you know, entrepreneurs getting their houses raided by the FBI and, you know, like the whole paniply of things that, you know, that happened and like I didn't really I I now in retrospect now that I now that I go back and look, I'm like, "Oh my god, this was actually much worse than I thought." Um, what do you do you do you have that experience? And as as as you're in there and kind of as you now have like a complete view of everything that happens, like do do you think people understand actually how bad it was?</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为这是一个很好的观点。我以前也并不真正了解。我们知道正在发生“去银行化”（debanking），不仅是加密货币公司被取消银行服务，它们的创始人个人也被取消了。如果你是一家加密货币公司的创始人，你就无法开设银行账户。这是一个巨大的问题。你怎么交易？怎么付款？怎么给员工发薪？这基本上剥夺了你的生计，是一种非常极端的审查形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think it's a a great point. I mean, I didn't really know either. You kind of heard um generally I mean, we knew that there was debanking going on and and by the way, it wasn't just crypto companies that were being debanked, but their founders were being debanked personally. So, if you were the founder of a crypto company, you couldn't open a bank account. I mean, that's a huge problem. It's like how do you how do you transact? How do you make payments? um how do you pay people? I mean it basically deprivives you of a livelihood. It's a very extreme form of censorship.</p>
</details>

然后当然还有所有由SEC主导的起诉。所以情况确实非常糟糕。我记得大概在三月份，我们在白宫举办了一次加密货币峰会，其中一位与会者说：“一年前，我以为我进监狱的可能性比来白宫的可能性更大。”所以，这对整个行业来说是一个非常重要的里程碑。他们从未得到过任何形式的认可。在白宫为这个行业举办活动，这个想法本身就非同寻常。至少，我认为加密货币被视为非常低等的。但无论如何，这确实是一个巨大的转变。我们基本上已经制止了那种情况。而且这非常不公平，因为这些创始人想要遵守规则，但却没人告诉他们规则是什么。我认为这都是一个蓄意策略的一部分，目的就是要把加密货币赶出海外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was definitely happening. And then of course you have all the the prosecutions uh that the SEC was behind. So yeah, it was it was really bad. I remember um back in I think it was in March uh we had a crypto summit at the White House and um one of the attendees said that you know a year ago uh I would have thought it was more likely that I'd be in jail than that I'd be at the White House. Um and so it was you know it was a really big milestone for for the industry. They had never ever received any kind of recognition like that. The idea that this was even a industry that you would do an event at the White House. I mean um at a minimum I think crypto is seen as very day class. Um but uh but in any event yeah no it's been a it's been a huge shift. I mean, we basically have have um have stopped that. And um and you know, it was very unfair because again, these founders wanted to comply with the rules, but they weren't told what they were. Um and that was all part of a deliberate strategy, I think, to drive crypto offshore.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我们注意到加密货币和AI之间一个很大的不同是，在加密货币领域，每个人都只想要规则，整个行业相对团结。而在AI领域，我们看到了一些非常有趣的“内鬼”呼声，某些公司明显在寻求**监管捕获**（Regulatory Capture: 指监管机构本应为公众利益服务，但其决策却被受监管行业的利益所主导的现象）。那些早期领先的公司说，让我们阻止所有新公司开发AI等等。你对此有何看法？你认为未来会怎样发展？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One of the things that um is very different between crypto and AI that we've noticed is that on the crypto front, everybody just wanted rules. um and the industry was relatively unified. Whereas in AI, we've seen very like interesting kind of calls coming from inside the house with uh certain companies really going for regulatory capture. You know, people who have early leads saying let's cut off all new companies from developing AI and so forth. Um what do you make of that and and where do you think that's going?</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为这是一个非常大的问题。我最近就批评了一家我们投资的AI模型公司，因为它在搞监管捕获策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's I think it's a very big problem. Um I actually recently criticized uh one of our AI model companies for engaging in regulatory capture strategy.</p>
</details>

当然他们否认了。基本上是Anthropic公司。在他们否认之后，他们的联合创始人兼政策负责人Jack Clark在一个会议上发表演讲，他把对AI的恐惧比作一个孩子看到黑暗中有怪物，但当你打开灯，怪物就在那里。我认为这是一个极其荒谬的比喻，非常幼稚，近乎于自我控诉，因为你基本上承认了这种恐惧是捏造的，不是真实的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of course they denied it and then uh should I tell the story? I mean yeah sure rarely do you get vindicated on on X so so thoroughly and completely as I did on this because after this company it was basically anthropic after they denied it. There was um I mean what basically happened is that Jack Clark who's a co-founder and head of policy philanthropic gave a speech at a a conference where he said that uh he he compared fear of AI to a child um you know seeing monsters in the dark or or or thinking there were monsters in the dark and but then you turn the lights on and the monsters are there. I thought that was such a um ridiculous analogy. I mean it's basically purile. I mean, it's it's so childish just to be almost self-indicting because you're basically admitting the fear is made up, not real.</p>
</details>

无论如何，我说：“这就是在散播恐惧，是他们监管捕获策略的一部分。”他们当然否认了。但随后，一位在场听他演讲的律师说：“是的，但Jack没有告诉你们他在问答环节说了什么。”他基本上承认了Anthropic所做的一切，比如SB53法案（一项旨在提高透明度的法案），都只是实现他们真正目标的垫脚石。他们的真正目标是在华盛顿建立一个预批准系统，在你发布新模型之前必须获得批准。他在问答环节承认，让人们感到非常害怕是他们策略的一部分。这简直是你能在X（前身为Twitter）上的一场争论中找到的最确凿的证据了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, in any event, so I said, "Well, this is like fear-mongering and part of their regulatory capture strategy." And of course, they denied it. But then um a lawyer who was in the crowd at his speech said, "Well, yeah, but Jack's not telling you what he said during the Q&A, which he basically admitted that everything that Anthropic was doing was uh you know, with with like things like SB53, which is supposedly just implementing transparency." He said, "No, that's all that he admitted that was just a stepping stone to their real goal, which was to get an approval, a system of pre-approvals in Washington before you can release new models." and he admitted as part of the Q&A that making people very afraid was part of their strategy. So again, just as much as a smoking gun as you could ever get um in a in a spaton X.</p>
</details>

我认为这种做法之所以如此具有破坏性，是因为过去几十年来让硅谷与众不同的真正原因是**无需许可的创新**（Permissionless Innovation: 指创新者无需事先获得政府或监管机构的批准，即可开发和推出新产品或服务的原则）。就是说，两个在车库里的人就可以追求他们的想法。他们或许能从天使投资人或风险投资公司那里筹集一些资金，这些人愿意承担血本无归的风险。这些年轻的创始人，可能是在宿舍里的未来辍学生，他们能够自由地追求自己的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the reason why I think that that approach is so damaging is that the thing that's uh really made I think Silicon Valley special over the past several decades is permissionless innovation. Right? It's that two guys in a garage can just pursue their idea. you know, maybe they raise some capital from angels or VC firms. B basically people who are willing to lose all of their money and these are people who, you know, are young founders. They could also be, you know, it could be the the the dropout, the future dropout in a dorm room and they're able to just to pursue their idea.</p>
</details>

我认为这之所以只在硅谷发生，而像制药、医疗、国防或银行这些高度管制的行业里却很少看到初创公司，就是因为它们都受到严格监管。这意味着你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能做事。我在华盛顿看到的情况是，批准制度的设立总是有原因的，但这些原因很快就不再重要。重要的是你的政府事务团队有多擅长在官僚机构中周旋，并弄清楚如何获得这些批准。这并不是典型的初创公司创始人擅长的事情。而大公司则擅长此道，因为它们有资源，这正是监管捕获的含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the only reason that I think has happened in Silicon Valley whereas you look at in you know industries like um I don't know like pharma or um you know healthcare or defense or banking or these highly regulated industries where you just don't see a lot of startups is because they're all heavily regulated which means you have to go to Washington to get permission to do things. And the thing I've seen in Washington is just that, you know, the approvals get set up for reasons, but those reasons very quickly stop mattering. And it just matters like how good your government affairs team is at navigating through the bureaucracy and figuring out how to get those approvals. And it's not something that your typical startup founders are going to be good at. Um, it's something that big companies get good at because they've got the resources and that's exactly what regulatory capture means.</p>
</details>

所以，硅谷成功的基础，它成为美国经济皇冠上的明珠、世界其他国家羡慕对象的原因，就是“无需许可的创新”。而现在正在针对AI考虑、讨论和实施的，是一个针对软件和硬件的审批系统。这并非理论上的。在硬件方面，这已经发生了。拜登政府在最后一周做的一件事就是实施了所谓的“拜登扩散规则”（Biden diffusion rule），要求地球上每一笔GPU的销售都必须获得政府的许可，也就是说要预先批准，除非它符合某些例外类别。但总的来说，其核心思想是，计算能力现在将成为一个需要许可和预先批准的类别。我们已经废除了这项规定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the the whole basis of Silicon Valley success, the reason why it's really the the crown jewel of the American economy and the envy of the rest of the world. We see all these attempts by all these other countries to create their own Silicon Valley. The the reason that's the case is because of permissionless innovation. And what is being contemplated and discussed and implemented with respect to AI is an approval system for both software and hardware. Uh and this is not theoretical. This has already been happening on the the hardware side. One of the last things that the Biden administration did the last week the Biden administration was um impose the so-called Biden diffusion rule which requires that every sale of a GPU on Earth be licensed by the government which is to say preapproved um unless it fits into some category of exception but basically the overall idea is that you know uh compute is now going to be um a licensed and and pre-approved um category. uh we rescended that.</p>
</details>

在软件方面，正如我所说，目标非常明确，就是从向政府和各州提交报告要求开始，然后逐步升级到你必须去华盛顿获得许可才能发布新模型。这会极大地减缓创新速度，降低美国的竞争力。这些批准可能需要数月，甚至数年。当每年都有新芯片发布时，而我们的许可申请已经在审批流程中搁置了两年，等到最终批准时，这些请求早已过时。对于模型来说更是如此，新模型的周期时间可能只有三四个月。华盛顿的官僚机构对这项技术到底了解多少，能让他们有资格去批准它呢？但无论如何，这就是目前正在考虑的事情，我认为这对硅谷、对创新，乃至对美国的竞争力来说都将是一场灾难。如果我们采用这套规则，我认为我们将在AI竞赛中输给像中国这样的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then on the the software side like I said I mean the goal very clearly is to start with these reporting requirements to the government to the states and then where that ramps up to is you have to go to Washington to get permission uh before you release a new model and um you know it's this would drastically slow down innovation and make America less competitive. I mean, you know, these approvals can take months, they can take years. Uh, when models are when when a new chip is released every year and we have licenses that have been sitting in the hopper for 2 years, I mean, the requests are obsolete by the time they finally get approved. And um, that would be even more true with models where, you know, the the cycle time is, you know, like three three or four months for a new model. I mean, you know, and and and what exactly is a bureaucracy in Washington going to know about uh this technology that, you know, that they're that they're going to be in a good position to to approve it. Any event, but this is what is being contemplated right now and I think it would be a disaster for for Silicon Valley, but also and for innovation, but therefore for American competitiveness and I think we will lose the AI race uh to countries like China if you know if this is if this is the set of rules that we have.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 他们论点中一个非常阴险的地方在于，如果他们真的相信有怪物存在，那为什么他们购买GPU的速度比任何人都快？另外，作为业内人士我们知道，他们在自己代码的安全实践方面声誉是全行业最差的。所以如果你在建造这个怪物，你最不想做的事情就是留下很多漏洞让别人来攻击。所以他们说的任何话自己都不信。这完全是为了通过同样疯狂的手段来维持他们的领先地位而编造出来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One of the really diabolical things about their argument is if they really believed there was a monster then why are they buying GPUs like at a rate faster than anybody? And then the other thing that we know from being in the industry is their reputation is the literally the worst security practices in the entire industry with respect to their own code. So if you were building this monster, the last thing you'd want to do is like leave a bunch of holes around for people to hack it. Um so they don't believe anything they're saying. It's like completely made up to try and maintain their lead by the same psychotic.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为这是一种令人陶醉的毒药，基本上是说：“我们正在创造这种可能毁灭人类的新超级智能，但我们是唯一有德行能确保这件事被正确完成的人。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think there is um I think it's a heady drug to basically say that um that you know we're we're creating this you know new super intelligence that is going to could destroy humanity but we're the only ones who are virt virtuous enough to ensure that this is done correctly right and I think that you know</p>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 是的，我认为是这样。在所有公司中，那家公司在监管捕获和推动这些法规方面最为激进。让我们把话题提升一个层次，不只是针对他们。目前有大约1200项法案正在各州立法机构审议，旨在监管AI。其中25%集中在加州、纽约、科罗拉多和伊利诺伊这四个主要的蓝州。已经有超过一百项措施获得通过。仅在加州，上个月就有三项法案签署生效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">yes um I think that's right. but yeah but I think that is definitely um you So I I I think of of all the companies that particular one has been the most aggressive uh in terms of the regulatory capture and pushing these um for the these regulations. And just I mean let's just bring it up a level just doesn't have to be about them. Um there's now something like 1,200 bills going through state uh legislators right now to regulate AI. uh 25% of them are in um the the top four blue states which are California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. Uh over a hundred measures have already passed. Um I think three of them just got signed in the last month in California alone.</p>

### “奥威尔式AI”：真正的风险并非终结者，而是《1984》

科罗拉多、伊利诺伊和加州都实施了某种版本的“算法歧视”法案，我认为其发展方向非常令人担忧。这个概念意味着，如果模型产生的输出对受保护群体产生了不成比例的负面影响，那么这就是算法歧视。而受保护群体的名单非常长，远不止通常的那几个。例如，在科罗拉多州，他们将英语水平可能不高的人定义为受保护群体。所以，我猜如果模型说了关于非法移民的坏话，那就基本上违反了法律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll tell you just let me tell you what Colorado is actually Colorado, Illinois, and California have all done some version of a thing called algorithmic discrimination. um which I think is it's really troubling where where it's headed. Um what what this concept means is that if the model produces an output that has a disperate impact on a protected group then that is algorithmic discrimination and the list of protected groups is um is very long. It's more than just the the the usual ones. So, for example, in Colorado, they've defined um people who um may not have English language proficiency as a protected group. So, I guess if the model says something bad about, you know, illegal aliens and that would be, you know, that would basically violate the law.</p>
</details>

我不知道模型公司到底该如何遵守这项规则。按理说，歧视本身已经是违法的。所以如果你是一家企业，违反了民权法，实施了歧视，你已经要为此负责。如果你在犯错的过程中恰好使用了某种工具，我们并不需要去追究工具开发者的责任，因为我们已经可以追究做出那个决定的企业的责任。但这些法律的全部目的就是针对工具本身。他们不仅让使用AI的企业承担责任，还让工具开发者承担责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know exactly how model companies are even supposed to comply with this rule. I mean, presumably, presumably discrimination is already illegal. So if you're a business and you violate the civil rights laws and you engage in discrimination, you're already liable for that. You know, there's no reason you know if if you happen to um you know make that mistake and you use any kind of tool in the process of doing it, we don't really need to go after the tool developer because we can already go after the business that's made that decision. But the whole purpose of of these laws is to get at the tool. They're making not just the the business that is using AI liable, they're making the tool developer liable.</p>
</details>

我甚至不知道工具开发者该如何预见这种情况，因为你怎么知道你的工具会被用在所有可能的方式上？你怎么知道某个输出——特别是当这个输出是100%真实和准确，模型在尽其职责时——会被用作一个产生不成比例负面影响的决策的一部分？然而，你还是要承担责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I don't even know how the tool developer is supposed to anticipate this because how do you know all the ways that your tool is going to be used? How do you know that um that this output, you know, especially if the output is 100% true and accurate and the model is doing its job? um you know then how are you supposed to know that that was that output was used as part of a decision that had a disperate impact? Nevertheless, you're liable.</p>
</details>

我能想到的模型开发者唯一能尝试遵守的方式，就是在他们的模型中内置一个**DEI**（Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元、公平和包容）层，试图预测“这个答案是否可能产生不成比例的影响？”如果可能，他们要么不能给你答案，要么必须对答案进行净化或扭曲。将此推向逻辑的极致，我们就回到了“觉醒AI”（woke AI）的老路，而这恰恰是拜登政府的一个主要目标。我们废除的那份拜登关于AI的行政命令，其中有大约20页的DEI语言。他们非常努力地在模型中推广他们所谓的“DEI价值观”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the only way that I can see for model developers to even attempt to comply with this is to build a DEI layer into their models that tries to anticipate could this answer have a disparit impact? And if it does, we either can't give you the answer. We have to sanitize or distort the answer. Uh, and you know, you just take this to its logical conclusion and we're back to, you know, woke AI, which by the way was a major objective of the Biden administration. Um, that that Biden executive order on AI that we rescended as part of the Trump administration had something like 20 pages of DEI language in it. They were very much trying to promote uh DEI values, they called it, in models</p>
</details>

我们已经看到了这样做的结果。我们看到了那个“黑人乔治·华盛顿”事件，历史被实时改写，因为有人在模型中内置了一个DEI层。我甚至觉得“觉醒AI”这个词都不足以解释正在发生的事情，因为它在某种程度上把问题轻描淡写了。我们真正谈论的是“奥威尔式AI”。我们谈论的是一种会对你撒谎、扭曲答案、为了服务于当权者当前的政治议程而实时改写历史的AI。这非常奥威尔式，而在特朗普总统当选之前，我们无疑正走在这条路上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and we saw what the result of that was. you know, uh, it was, you know, we saw the whole black George Washington thing where history was being rewritten in real time because somebody built, you know, a DEI layer into the model. Um and um, and I, you know, and I I almost feel like the term woke AI is insufficient to explain what's going on because it somehow trivializes it. I mean, what we're really talking about is Orwellian AI. You know, we're talking about AI that um that lies to you, that um that distorts an an answer that rewrites history in real time to serve a current political agenda of the people who are in power. I mean, it's it's um it's very Orwellian and um and we were definitely on that path before President Trump's election.</p>
</details>

这曾是拜登行政命令的一部分。我们在第一代Gemini模型的发布中看到了它的发生。那些扭曲的输出不是偶然的，它们来自某个地方。所以对我来说，AI最大的风险其实不是詹姆斯·卡梅隆描述的那样，而是乔治·奥威尔描述的。在我看来，不是《终结者》，而是《1984》。随着AI吞噬互联网，成为我们在线互动和获取信息的主要方式，它将被当权者用来控制我们接收的信息。它将包含意识形态偏见，本质上会对我们进行审查。所有为社交媒体创建的“信任与安全”机制都将被移植到这个AI的新世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh it was part of the Biden EO. We saw it happen, you know, in in the release of that first Gemini model. uh that was not an accident that you know that th those distorted outputs came from somewhere. Um so it was you know to just to me this is the the biggest risk of AI actually is it's not it was not described by James Cameron it was described by George Orwell you know it's in my view it's not the Terminator it's 1984 that um you know that as AI eats the internet and becomes the main way that we interact and get our information online that it'll be used by the people in power to um to control the information we receive. Um that it'll contain anid ideological bias that essentially it'll censor us. All that trust and safety apparatus that was created for social media will be ported over to this new world of AI.</p>
</details>

除此之外，还有监控问题。AI将了解你的一切，成为你的个人助理。因此，它对政府来说是监控和控制你的完美工具。对我而言，这才是AI迄今为止最大的风险，也是我们应该努力防止的事情。问题在于，许多由这些散播恐惧的手段催生出来的法规，实际上正在赋予政府权力，去进行这种我认为我们都应该非常害怕的控制。

And so it's kind of the perfect tool for the government to um monitor and control you. And to me that is by far the biggest risk of of AI. And that's the thing we should be working towards preventing. And the problem is a lot of these regulations that are being whipped up by these um fear-mongering techniques, they're actually empowering the government to uh to engage in this type of control that I think we should all be very afraid of.

### AI发展现状：从“AGI迫近论”到“恰到好处”的多神论

**主持人：** Sam Altman本周早些时候表示，他预计到2028年将拥有自动化的研究人员。我很好奇你对AI模型开发或整体进展的看法是什么？你认为这意味着什么？有些人一直在说**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能，指拥有与人类相当或超越人类智慧的AI）两年内就会到来。你对AI发展的现状有何解读？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sam Alman earlier this week said that in 2028 or by 2028, he expects to have automated researchers. I'm I'm I'm curious just for your sort of state of of AI sort of model development or or just progress in general and what do you think are the implications? Some people have been sort of, you know, saying that, you know, AGI is two years away, sort of the AI 2027 papers, the old Ashen Brener's situational awareness papers. I'm curious kind of what's your reading of the of the state of play in terms of a AI development and what are the implications from that?</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我的感觉是，硅谷的人们正在从所谓的“AGI迫近论”中退后。我看到Andrej Karpathy接受采访时突然改口，说AGI至少还有十年之遥。他基本上是说，强化学习有其局限性。它非常有用，是目前取得很大进展的主要范式，但他认为人类学习的方式并非真正通过强化学习。我们做的事情有些不同，我认为这是件好事，因为这意味着人类和AI将是协同的。如果AI的理解基于强化学习，那将与我们的直觉和推理方式有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so my sense is that um people are in Silicon Valley are kind of pulling back from the let's call it imminent AGI narrative. Um I saw Andre Carpathy gave an interview where all of a sudden he's he's um rewritten this and he says AGI is at least a decade away. He's basically saying that um that you know reinforcement learning has its limits. I mean it's it's very useful. It's the main paradigm right now that they're making a lot of progress with. But he says that actually the way that humans learn is not really through reinforcement. We do something a little different which I think is a good thing because it means that human and AI will be synergistic, right? Right. I mean the the AI's um understanding if it's based on RL will be a little different than the way that we intuit it and and reason.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，我感觉到人们正在从这种“AGI迫近论”中退后。那种认为AGI两年内就会到来的想法——当然，人们对AGI的定义也不清楚——被用作一种吓人的方式，说它是一种会超出我们控制的超级智能。我觉得人们正在从这种观点中退后，并理解到，是的，我们仍在取得很大进展，而且进展惊人，但同时，我们所说的“智能”是多方面的，并非在每个维度上都在取得进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but in any event, I I sense more of a pullback from this imminent AGI narrative. Um you know, the idea that AGI is two years away. Of course, it's like kind of unclear what people mean by AGI, but it's kind of, you know, it was used in this like scary way that um it's kind of the a super intelligence that would grow beyond our control. Um I feel like people are pulling back from that and understanding that yes we're still making a lot of progress and the progress is amazing but at the same time you know what we mean by intelligence is multifaceted and it's not like you know there's progress being made along some dimensions but it's not along every dimension.</p>
</details>

因此，我将我们目前所处的状况描述为一种“金发姑娘”情景（Goldilocks scenario，意指恰到好处）。两个极端是，一边是可怕的“终结者”情景，即迫在眉睫的超级智能将超出我们的控制；另一边是你在媒体上经常听到的说法，即我们正处在一个巨大的泡沫中，整件事都是假的。媒体基本上在同时推动这两种说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so therefore I think again I would just I mean I've described actually the situation we're in right now as a little bit of a Goldilock scenario where um you know the extremes would be you know you kind of have the the scary Terminator situation imminent super intelligence that'll grow beyond our control on the other the other narrative you hear in the press a lot is that we're in a big bubble. So in other words the whole thing is fake and the media is basically pushing both narratives at the same time.</p>
</details>

但我认为真相更居于中间。这是一种“金发姑娘”情景，我们看到了大量的创新，我认为经济将因此获得巨大的生产力提升。但我喜欢Balaji最近的观察，他有几点让我印象深刻。第一，AI是“多神论”的，而不是“一神论”的。意思是，我们看到的不是一个全知全能的神，而是一群更小的神祇，即更专业化的模型。我们还没有走上那种递归式自我改进的轨道，但我们看到许多不同类型的模型在不同领域取得进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um, but any event, I think that the truth is is more in the middle. It's kind of a Goldilock scenario where um we're seeing a lot of innovation. I think the um the progress is impressive. Uh it's I think we're going to see big productivity gains in the economy from this. But uh but I like the observations that Bology made recently where he said there's a couple of things that really struck me. One was um AI is polytheistic, not monotheistic. Meaning what we're seeing is many instead of just one all- knowing all powerful god. What we're seeing is a bunch of smaller deities more specialized models um you know uh you know it's it's not that sort of um we're not on that kind of recursive self-improvement uh track just yet but you know we're seeing many different kinds of models make progress in different areas.</p>
</details>

另一个观察是，AI是“中段到中段”（middle to middle）的，而人类是“端到端”（end to end）的，因此两者关系是相当协同的。我认为这是对的。所有这些观察都与我目前对现状的看法产生共鸣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then the other the other um one was just his observation that AI was um was middle to middle whereas humans are end to end and therefore the relationship is is pretty synergistic and um I think that's right. I mean I think I think all th those observations are like resonate with me in terms of where we're at right now.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 这与我们看到的情况非常一致。我们曾认为肯定会被大模型吞并的想法，现在正变成差异化极大的业务。因为宇宙的长尾非常长，你需要对某些场景有非常具体的理解才能构建有效的模型。没有一个模型能解决所有问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And that that that's very consistent with what we're seeing as well where um you know ideas that we thought would for sure get subsumed by the big models are becoming amazingly differentiated businesses. Um just because the fat tail of the universe is very fat and you need really kind of specific understanding of certain scenarios to build an effective model and that that's just how it's going. you know, no model has just like figured out how to do everything.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 是的，模型在有上下文的情况下工作得最好。我们都见过，你的提示越笼统，得到出色回应的可能性就越小。如果你问AI一些非常笼统的问题，比如“我能创办什么业务来赚十亿美元？”它不会给你任何可操作的建议。你必须非常具体地说明你想做什么，并且它必须能访问相关数据，然后它才能给你一些具体的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, and the models work best when they have context, you know, and um the more I mean, we've all seen this, the more general your prompt, the less likely it is that you're going to be able to um you know, get get a great response. And um I don't know, if you tell the AI uh you know, uh something very general like um what business can I create to make a billion dollars? it it's not going to give you something actionable. You know, you have to get very specific about what you're trying to do and it has to have access to relevant data and then it can give you some specific answers to to um to a prompt.</p>
</details>

我认为这部分印证了Balaji的观点，即AI不会自己提出目标。它需要被提示，需要被告知做什么。我们没有看到任何证据表明现阶段这种情况正在改变。在AI能够自己提出目标方面，我们仍处于第零步。因此，模型必须被提示，然后它给你一个输出，而这个输出必须被验证。你必须以某种方式确保它是正确的，因为模型仍然可能出错。更有可能的是，你必须迭代几次，因为它不会完全给你你想要的东西。所以你现在要重新提示。这就是为什么聊天界面如此必要，因为它需要你迭代几次才能得到对你有价值的输出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and I think this is, you know, partly Bali's point, which is, you know, the the the AI does not come up with its own objective. You know, it needs to be prompted. It needs to be told what to do. We've seen no evidence that that's at this stage that that's changing. we're still at step zero in terms of AI kind of, you know, somehow coming up with its own objective. And um uh and as a result of that, you know, the model has to be prompted and then it gives you an output and that output has to be validated. You have to somehow make sure it's correct because models can still be wrong. Um and more likely you have to iterate a few times because it doesn't give you exactly what you want. So now you kind of reprompt and we've all had this experience, right? you this is why like the chat the chat um interface is so is so necessary is because it takes you a few times to kind of iterate to get to the output that actually has value for you.</p>
</details>

人类是端到端的，而AI是中段到中段的。我们没有看到任何证据表明这种基本动态正在改变。我们显然正处于智能体（agents）的开端，你可以给智能体一个目标，然后它就能代表你执行任务。但我怀疑，当智能体有一个更窄的上下文时，它们也会工作得更好。如果你给它一个非常宽泛的任务，它就更可能偏离轨道，走向奇怪的方向。它不太可能在需要人类干预之前完全解决问题。但如果你给它一个非常具体的事情去做，它成功的可能性就大得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um again you know humans are antenn and the the um the AI is middle to middle. I just don't you know we haven't seen any evidence that that fundamental dynamic is is changing. Um I mean I think you know we're at the I mean I'd love to hear what you guys think about this. this. I mean, we're obviously at the outset of of agents and um you know, and agents you can give an objective to and then'll be able to take tasks on your behalf. But I suspect that the agents will work better as well when they have a much more narrow context. They're much less likely to go off the rails, start going in weird directions. If you give it like a very broad, you know, a very broad task, it's just not likely to completely figure it out before it needs human intervention. But if you give it something very narrow to do, then it's much more likely to be successful.</p>
</details>

这在某种程度上也关系到整个失业的说法。我只是认为，在很长一段时间内，这将是一个非常具有协同作用的工具。我不认为它会消灭人类的工作。我不认为对人类认知的需求会消失。至少在可预见的未来，它将是我们都会用来获得巨大生产力提升的东西。我不知道五年或十年后会发生什么，但这就是我目前看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so, you know, I would just guess like, okay, just you tell the AI, um, you know, sell my product. You know, it's it's very unlikely that it's just going to figure out like what that means and how to do that. But if you're a sales rep and you're using the AI to help you, there's probably very specific tasks that you can tell it to do and it would be much more successful doing that. So, I I just tend to think I mean this also kind of speaks to the whole job loss narrative. I just think that this is going to be a very synergistic tool for a long time. I don't think it's going to wipe out um human human jobs. I don't think the need for human cognition is going away. Um it's something that, you know, we'll we'll all use to kind of get this big productivity boost at least for the foreseeable future. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if anyone can any of us can predict what's going to happen beyond five or 10 years, but I mean that's just what I'm seeing right now.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 马克·扎克伯格说过一句话我非常喜欢。他说：“看，智能不是生命。”我们与生命联系在一起的那些东西，比如我们有目标，我们有自由意志，我们有感知能力，这些都不是一个在分布中搜索并找出答案的数学模型的一部分。所以，我们看到，将AI与人类进行比较在很多方面都是不成立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think this gets to your main point, which is, and Mark Zuckerberg said something that I really liked. He's like, look, intelligence is not life. Um, and these things that we associate with life, um, like we have an objective. Um, we have free will, we're sentient. uh th those just aren't part of a mathematical model that is you know searching through a distribution and figuring out an answer or even you know a model that you know through a reinforcement learning technique can kind of improve its logic. So it's just like the the the comparison to humans I think is it just falls short in a lot of ways is what we're seeing you know we're just different you know then the models are very good at things they're better than humans at things already many things</p>

### AI的民主化与开源生态的挑战

**主持人：** 与此相关，我想提出的另一点是，世界的未来会是由一个或少数几个公司、政府或超级AI拥有和控制一切吗？还是说，这是一种会扩散出去、掌握在每个人手中、成为赋权、创造力和个人努力的工具的技术？我认为这个时期一个非常引人注目的事情是，第二种情景正在非常清晰地展现出来。AI实际上正在超速民主化。它在最短的时间内传播给了比历史上任何新技术都多的个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing I'd bring up related to this which is sort of this which I think is a little orthogonal but also quite related which is sort of is is the future of the world going to be one or a small number of companies or for that matter governments or super AIs that kind of own and control anything. Um, and sort of all the value rolls up into a handful of of entities and and you know, and there you get into this there's like the hyper capitalist version of it where a few companies make all the money or there's like the hyper communist version of it where you have total state control or whatever. Um, you know, or is this a technology that's going to diffuse out um and be like in everybody's hands um and be a tool of empowerment and creativity um and individual effort, you know, expressiveness and um and um and as a tool for basically everybody to use. I think one of the really striking things about this period of time and you being in this role is that this this is the period in which the scenario number two is very I think very clearly playing out um which is that this is the time in which AI is actually hyperdemocratizing. I think actually AI is actually hyperdemocratized. It has spread to more individuals um uh both in the country and around the world uh in the shortest period of time of any new technology I think in history.</p>
</details>

我们现在大约有6亿用户，并且正在迅速向10亿、50亿迈进。世界上最好的AI就在消费级产品中。所以，如果你使用现在的ChatGPT或Grok，我花再多钱也无法获得更好的AI。它就在消费级产品里。因此，在实践中，我们实时看到的是，这项技术将掌握在每个人手中。每个人都将能够用它来优化他们所做的事情，让它成为思想伙伴、创业助手或创作艺术的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, we're we're it's something like 600 million, you know, users today on on rapidly on the way to a billion, rapidly on the way to to 5 billion, you know, kind of across all the all the consumer products. And then and then the best AIs in the world are are in the consumer products, right? Um and so if you use the if you use, you know, current day Chad GPT or Grock or any of these things like, you know, I I I can't spend more money, you know, uh and uh and and get access to better AI. It's it's it's in the consumer products. And so just in practice, what you have like playing out in real time is this technology is going to be in everybody's hands. Um, and everybody is going to be able to use it to optim, you know, optimize the things that they do. Have it be a thought partner. Have it be, you know, somebody, you know, a a a um, you know, an assistant for for for building companies, you know, starting companies or creating art or, you know, doing all the things that people want to do.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为这项技术保持去中心化非常重要，因为那种奥威尔式的担忧是终极的中心化。幸运的是，到目前为止，我们在市场上看到的是高度竞争。有五家主要的模型公司都在进行巨额投资。模型的性能评估相对集中，并且有很多超越现象。比如Grok发布新模型，超越了ChatGPT，但接着ChatGPT发布新东西，又反超回来。它们都非常有竞争力，彼此非常接近。我认为这是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's so important that this um technology remain decentralized because the kind of the Orwellian concern is kind of the ultimate centralization and fortunately so far what we're seeing in the market is that it's hyper competitive. There's five major model companies all making huge investments. Um, and the uh the the the benchmark the the the model performance the evaluations are relatively clustered and there's a lot of leaprogging going on. So, you know, Grock releases new model, it leaprogs chat GBT and but then CGT releases something new, they they leap frog. So they're all like very competitive and close to each other. And I think that's uh that's a good thing.</p>
</details>

这与通过“AGI迫近论”所预测的恰恰相反。那种说法是，一个模型会取得领先，然后它会利用自己的智能来让自己变得更好，因此它的领先优势会越来越大，你就会得到这种递归式的自我改进，很快你就会走向奇点。但我们并没有真正看到这种情况。我们没有看到一个模型在能力上完全甩开其他模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's the opposite of what was predicted, you know, through this like imminent AGI story where the the the the sort of the the storytelling there was that one model would get a lead and then it would direct its own intelligence to making itself better and then so therefore its lead would get bigger and bigger and you kind of get this recursive self-improvement and pretty soon you're off to the the singularity. And um and and and we haven't really seen that, you know, we haven't seen one model completely pull away in terms of capabilities.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你和本届政府也一直非常支持开源AI，我认为这与市场竞争激烈这一点也是相符的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">David, you've also you and the administration I think have also been very supportive of open source AI which I think also dovtales into this in terms of like the market being very competitive. Do you want to spend a moment on what you guys have been able to do on that and how you think about it?</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 是的，开源非常重要，因为我认为它等同于自由，软件自由。你基本上可以在自己的硬件上运行自己的模型，并保留对自己信息的控制权。顺便说一下，企业通常一直都是这么做的。全球大约一半的数据中心市场是本地部署的，意味着企业和政府建立自己的数据中心，而不是使用大型云服务。我并非对超大规模云服务商有任何意见，只是人们喜欢运行自己的数据中心，并保持对自己数据的控制。我认为在某种程度上，消费者也会如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean so so just to the you open source is very important because I just think it's synonymous with um you know freedom I mean software freedom. You basically could run your own models on your own hardware and retain control over your own information. And by the way this is what enterprises typically do all the time is you know um about half the global data center market is you know is on prem meaning enterprises and governments create their own data centers. they don't go to the big clouds and by the way I've got nothing against the hyperscalers but just you know people like to run their own um you know own data centers and you know maintain control over their own data and that kind of thing and I think that will be true for consumers to some degree as well.</p>
</details>

所以，我确实认为这是一个我们应该鼓励和推广的重要领域。目前市场上的讽刺之处在于，最好的开源模型是中国的。这有点奇怪，对吧？这与你的预期相反。你可能期望美国体系会促进开放，而中国体系会促进封闭。但结果有点颠倒了。我认为这背后有很好的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so I do think it's an important area that we should you know want to encourage and promote the irony right now in the market is that um is that uh the best open source models are Chinese. Uh, and it's it's sort of a quirk, right? It's it's the opposite of what you'd expect. You'd expect like the American system would promote open and somehow the Chinese system would promote closed. That has kind of um, you know, ended up being a little backwards. Um, I think there's like good reasons for it.</p>
</details>

这可能只是一个历史偶然，比如DeepSeek的创始人非常致力于开源，就这么开始了。也可能是蓄意策略的一部分。如果你是中国，想要追赶，开源是一个非常好的方式，因为你可以吸引所有不结盟的开发者来帮助你的项目，这是封闭项目做不到的。所以这是一个很好的追赶策略。另外，如果你认为你的商业模式——作为一个公司或一个国家——是硬件的大规模制造，那么你会希望软件部分是免费或便宜的，因为它是你的互补品。所以你会试图商品化你的互补品。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh, it could just be it could just be kind of a historical accident. the fact that the Deep Seek founder was like very committed to open source and kind of just kind of that like got things started that way or it could be part of a deliberate strategy. Uh if you're China and you're trying to catch up, open source is a really good way to do that because you get all the non-aligned developers to want to help your project which they can't do if you know with a closed project. So it's a great strategy for catching up. And then also if you think that your business model you know as a company or as a country is let's say scale manufacturing of hardware then you'd want the the software part to be free or cheap because it's your compliment right so you try to commoditize your compliment.</p>
</details>

我不知道是偶然还是设计使然，但这似乎就是中国的策略。我认为美国对此的正确回应是鼓励我们自己的开源。如果我们能看到更多开源项目启动，那将是一件很棒的事情。我希望我们能在西方看到更多的开源创新。但我认为这非常重要，至关重要。在我看来，它与自由同义，绝对不是我们想要压制的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and I don't know whether it's by accident or part of design that that seems to be what the Chinese strategy has been I think that the the right answer for the US in this is to you know to encourage encourage our own open source. I mean, we I think it'd be a great thing if we saw more open source initiatives get get going. I guess there's one promising one called um Reflection, which um was founded by former um you know, engineers from uh from Google Deep Mind. Uh so I hope we see more open source innovation in in the west. But um but look, I think it's it's very important. is critical and like I said I in my view it's synonymous with with freedom and it's definitely not something we want to suppress.</p>
</details>

回到封闭生态系统，我们确实有五个主要竞争者，它们都在投入大量资金。我确实有点担心，在某个时间点，市场会整合，我们最终会像在其他技术市场看到的那样，出现垄断或双头垄断。我们在搜索领域就看到了这种情况。我只是觉得，如果这个市场能保持比一两个赢家更具竞争性，那会更好。我确实认为，拥有开源作为一个选项，总能确保即使市场真的整合了，你仍然有一个替代方案。而且这个替代方案更完全在你的控制之下，而不是受制于一个大公司，或者像我们在“推特文件”中看到的那样，深层政府（deep state）与那个公司合作。深层政府与所有这些社交媒体公司合作，实施了比我们任何人想象的都更广泛的审查。

<p class="english-text">Now just back to the the closed ecosystem for a second. It's true we have five major competitors there and they're all spending a lot of money. I do worry a little bit that at some point some point in time that the model consol not the model the um the market consolidates and we end up with you know like a monopoly or duopoly or something like that as we've seen in other technology markets. We saw this with search and you know and so on down the line. And I just think that it would be good if this market stayed more competitive than just one or two winners. Um and um I I don't I don't really know what to do about that. I'm just making that observation. And I I do think that having open source as an option always then ensures that even if the market does consolidate that you do have an alternative and it's an alternative that's more fully within your control as opposed to a large corporation or um you know or or the deep state you know working with that corporation as we saw in the Twitter files that you know the deep state was working with all these um you know social media companies um you know in in implementing much more widespread censorship than I think we any of us thought possible.</p>

**主持人：** 很多年前，彼得·蒂尔曾说过，他认为加密货币将是自由主义的或去中心化的，而AI将是共产主义的或中心化的。我想我们可能学到的一件事是，技术并非决定论，有一系列的选择决定了这些技术是去中心化的还是中心化的。也许我们可以以此为契机，更深入地探讨与中国的竞争状况。大卫，你能不能阐述一下，要想做对，最重要的是什么？

And um maybe we could segue use that as a segue to go deeper into the the state of the race with China. Uh maybe David you could lay out the sort of the the what's most important to to get right.</p>

### 美国赢得AI竞赛的三大支柱

**大卫·萨克斯：** 当我们谈论赢得AI竞赛时，有时我们说是在与中国竞赛，有时我们说得更模糊一些，因为我认为我们不应该过分执着于我们的竞争对手或对手。我认为我们是否能赢，主要取决于我们对自己技术生态系统所做的决定，而不是我们对他们做了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, when we talk about winning the AI race, um, sometimes we say we're in a race against China, sometimes we just leave it a little bit more vague because I I don't think we should become overly obsessed with our uh, competitors or adversaries. I think whether we win or not will mostly have to do with the decisions we make about our own technology ecosystem, not about, you know, what we do v visa v them.</p>
</details>

总统在他7月23日的AI政策演讲中，提到了我们如何赢得这场AI竞赛的几个关键支柱。顺便说一句，我不是说它会结束，这可能是一场无限游戏，但我们至少希望处于领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the president in in his July 23rd speech on AI policy, I think mentioned a few of the key pillars of of, you know, of of how we win this this AI race. Um, and by the way, I'm not saying it ever ends. This it might be an infinite game, but um but we want to be in the lead at least.</p>
</details>

第一是创新。支持私营部门非常重要，因为他们是创新的主体。我们不可能通过监管来击败我们的对手，我们必须通过创新超越他们。我认为目前最大的障碍是各州疯狂的过度监管。我迫切地认为我们需要一个单一的联邦标准。一个由50个不同监管制度组成的拼凑体，遵守起来将极其繁重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one is innovation. You know it's very important to support the private sector because they're the ones who do the innovation. We're not going to regulate our way to beating our our adversary. We just have to out innovate them. Um I mentioned I I think right now the biggest obstacle is the the the the um frenzy of overregulation happening at the states. I desperately think we need um a federal a single federal standard. Uh a patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes is going to be incredibly burdensome to comply with.</p>
</details>

我认为美国最大的优势之一是我们拥有一个庞大的全国性市场，而不是50个独立的州市场。就像欧盟成立前的欧洲，在互联网时代根本没有竞争力，因为它有30个不同的监管制度。我们必须维护这一点，我认为我们最终会得到一些联邦优先权（federal preemption）。问题只在于我们是获得强优先权还是弱优先权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think one of America's greatest advantages is that we have a large national market, right? Not 50 separate state markets like kind of, you know, Europe before the EU wasn't competitive at all in the internet because it's 30 different regulatory regimes. So we have to preserve that and I think we will eventually get some some federal preeemption. I think the question will just again be whether we preempt heavy or preempt light.</p>
</details>

第二个重要领域是基础设施和能源。我们希望帮助正在发生的这场惊人的基础设施建设热潮。我认为其中最大的限制因素将是能源。我认为特朗普总统在这方面非常有远见。他多年前就在谈论“钻探吧，宝贝，钻探吧”（drill baby drill）。他明白能源是一切的基础，绝对是这场AI热潮的基础。我们希望基本上清除所有不必要的法规、许可限制和大量的**NIMBYism**（Not In My Back Yard: “邻避效应”或“不要建在我家后院”的心态），以便AI公司能够建造数据中心并为其供电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, second big area is infrastructure, you know, and energy. You know, we want to help this this um amazing infrastructure boom that's happening. And the biggest, I think, limiting factor there is just going to be around energy. Uh, I think President Trump's been incredibly far-sighted in this. I mean, he was talking about drill baby drill many years ago. Um, he understood that energy is the basis for everything. It's definitely the basis for this AI boom. And we want to basically get all of these unnecessary regulations, the permitting restrictions, a lot of the nimism out of the way so that um AI companies can build data centers and get power for them.</p>
</details>

第三个领域是出口。这可能是最具争议的一个，它真正体现了硅谷和华盛顿之间的文化鸿沟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third area is is around exports. And maybe this has been the most controversial one. Um, and it really speaks to the cultural divide between Silicon Valley and and Washington.</p>
</details>

### 对华技术出口战略：生态系统思维 vs. 指挥控制

我认为我们所有在硅谷的人都明白，赢得技术竞赛的方式是建立最大的生态系统。你让最多的开发者在你的平台上开发，你的应用商店里有最多的应用，每个人都用你的产品。那些通常获胜的公司是那些获得所有用户、所有开发者的公司。所以我们在硅谷有一种合作心态。我们希望发布API，让每个人都来使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think all of us in Silicon Valley understand that the way that you win a technology race is by building the biggest ecosystem, right? You get the most developers building on your your platform, you get the most apps in your app store, everyone just uses you. I mean, you know, those are the companies that typically win are the ones that get all the users, all the developers, and so on. And so we in Silicon Valley have a partnership mentality. You know, we want to just publish the APIs and get everyone using them.</p>
</details>

华盛顿的心态则不同。它更倾向于指挥和控制。我们希望你获得批准，我们想囤积这项技术，只有美国应该拥有它。我认为这正是“拜登扩散规则”的核心。那个规则的要点是阻止扩散。扩散是个坏词。但在硅谷，我们明白扩散是取胜之道。我们称之为“使用率”。我们明白，获得最多的用户是取胜之道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Washington has a different mentality, right? It's much more of a command and control. We want you to get approved. Um you know, we kind of want to hoard this technology. Only America should have it. Um and and this this was really fundamental, I think, to the Biden diffusion rule where the the point of that rule is to stop diffusion, right? Diffusion is a is a is a bad word. Um but in Silicon Valley we understand that diffusion is how you win. Um I know I mean I don't think we ever called it diffusion before. That was a new word for me. We just called it usage. Uh but we understand that like getting the most users is how you win.</p>
</details>

所以现在正在发生一场根本性的文化冲突。我对此的分析是，我们决定卖什么给中国总是复杂的，因为他们是我们的竞争对手和对手，还有潜在的军民两用问题。所以卖什么给中国是个微妙的问题。但我们卖什么给世界其他地方，这应该是个简单的问题，那就是我们应该希望与世界其他地方做生意。我们应该希望拥有尽可能大的生态系统。我们从我们的技术联盟中排斥的每一个国家，基本上都是在把他们推向中国的怀抱，这让中国的生态系统变得更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so there's like a fundamental culture clash going on right now. And um you know the way I kind of parse it is that what we decide to sell to China is always going to be comp uh complicated because you know they're our competitor and our adversary and there's the whole potential dual use and so the the the question of what you sell to China is is nuanced. Um but what we sell to the rest of the world that should be an easy question which is we should want to do business with the rest of the world. We should want to have the largest ecosystem possible. uh and every country we exclude from our technology alliance were basically driving into the arms of China and it makes their ecosystem bigger.</p>
</details>

我们在拜登执政期间看到的是，他们不断地把其他国家推向中国的怀抱，从2023年10月的海湾国家开始。基本上，像沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋这些长期以来的美国盟友，不被允许从美国购买芯片。换句话说，他们不被允许建立数据中心和参与AI。我们告诉所有这些国家，AI对未来至关重要，它将是经济的基础，但我们却把你们排除在美国技术栈之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what we saw under the the the the the Biden years is that they were constantly pushing other countries uh into the arms of China starting with the Gulf states in um October of 2023. Basically the the Gulf States and I'm talking about countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, long-standing US allies, they weren't allowed to buy chips from the US. In other words, they weren't allowed to set up data centers and participate in in AI. And um you know, here we are telling all these countries that, you know, AI is fundamental to the future. It's going to be the basis of the economy, and yet we're excluding you from participating in the American tech stack.</p>
</details>

很明显他们会怎么做。我们给他们的唯一选择就是去找中国。所以，所有这些规则基本上只是为中国的芯片和模型创造了积压的需求，并创造了一个华为版的“一带一路”。我们听说华为已经开始在中东和东南亚扩散。我只是觉得这是一个非常适得其反的策略。我们完全是在搬起石头砸自己的脚。最大的讽刺是，那些推动这种把所有国家推向中国怀抱的策略的人，自称为“中国鹰派”，好像他们做的事情在伤害中国。不，这实际上是在帮助中国。这基本上是把市场拱手相让。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, it's obvious what they're going to do. You know, the only play we're giving them is to go to China. And so, you know, all of these rules basically just create pent-up demand for for um for Chinese chips and models. and it creates a Huawei belt and road. And we are hearing that um that Huawei is starting to uh proliferate or diffuse um in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia. And I just think it's a really counterproductive strategy. We're completely shooting ourselves in the foot. And like the the greatest irony is that the people who've been pushing this strategy of driving all these countries into China's arms have called themselves China hawks. you know, as if what they're doing is uh is hurting China. No, it's like it's it's helping China. I mean, it's basically just handing them markets.</p>
</details>

我们的产品更好。但如果你不给这些国家购买美国技术栈的选择，他们显然会选择中国的技术栈。中国正在推广DeepSeek模型和华为芯片，他们可不会为是否向阿联酋出口用于数据中心的芯片会创造出“终结者”而伤脑筋。而我们却为不向我们的朋友出售美国技术编造了各种荒谬的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And our products are better. Uh but if you don't give these countries a choice to buy the American tech stack, obviously they're going to go with the Chinese tech stack.

### 能源瓶颈：赢得竞赛的基础设施挑战

**主持人：** 我们是否应该更深入地探讨基础设施和能源问题，即要获得足够的容量真正需要什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should we go deeper on sort of the infrastructure energy point in terms of what it's really going to take to to to to get enough capacity or what's what's most important in that second bullet you were talking about?</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 首先，特朗普总统已经签署了多项行政命令，以允许核能发展并简化许可程序。我们甚至为数据中心开放了联邦土地，希望能帮助绕过一些州和地方的限制。总统显然也让建立新的能源项目、发电等变得容易得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, well, so I mean, there there are definitely people who are much more knowledgeable about energy than I am and are experts in the space. But here's what I've been able to kind of divine is um so first of all, the administration, President Trump has signed multiple executive orders to uh to allow for nuclear to make permitting easier. We've even freed up federal land uh for for data centers to hopefully trying to help get around some of these state and local restrictions. And obviously the president has made it a lot easier to um to stand up new um uh energy projects, uh power generation, all that kind of stuff.</p>
</details>

就电力而言，我的理解是核能需要5到10年时间，这不是我们未来两三年能做到的。所以在短期内，这意味着天然气将是这些数据中心的主要供电方式。天然气的问题不在于储量——美国有充足的天然气——而在于燃气轮机的短缺。世界上只有两三家公司生产这些设备，积压订单已经排到了两三年后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um in terms of of power, so my understanding is that nuclear is going to take 5 or 10 years. It's just it's just not something that we're going to be able to do in the next two or three years. So in the short term, it really means that like gas is the way that these data centers are going to get um powered. And the the issue with gas is the shortage there is not I mean America has plenty of natural gas and um there's uh it exists in plenty of enough red states where you could just build out data centers like close to the source which be smart. Uh the issue is there's like a shortage of these um gas turbines. You know there's only like two or three companies that make these things and like there's like a backlog of two or three years.</p>
</details>

然而，我确实认为在未来两三年内，我们可以从电网中获得更多电力。有能源行业的高管告诉我，如果我们能将每年40小时的峰值负荷从电网转移到备用发电机（如柴油发电机），就可以额外释放80吉瓦的电力，这是一个很大的数字。因为电网的容量利用率全年大约只有50%，他们必须为峰值日（如夏天最热的一天，冬天最冷的一天）建设足够的容量。他们不想过度承诺容量，然后发现冬天特别冷，人们家里供暖不足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However I do think that in the next 2 or 3 years we could get a lot more out of the grid. So, I've had um you know, energy executives tell me that uh that if we could just shed um 40 hours a year of peak load from the grid to like backup generators, to diesel, things like that, you could free up an additional 80 gawatts of power, which is a lot because I guess the way that it works is um is, you know, the the grid is only used about 50% uh 50% of the capacity is used throughout the here uh because they have to build enough capacity for the the peak the peak days like the hottest day in summer, the coldest day in winter. Those are your peak days. Uh and they don't want to um commit to a bunch of the capacity being used and then you know you find out that you have a really cold day in winter and people can't get enough heat for their their homes. And so um so they can't like overcommit to you know to say contracts or data centers, things like that.</p>
</details>

但如果你能将那每年40小时的峰值负荷转移到备用电源，你就能释放出80吉瓦的电力。这绝对能让我们度过未来两三年，直到燃气轮机的瓶颈问题得到缓解。然后最终你就能转向核能。问题在于，有一大堆疯狂的法规阻止负荷转移，比如你不能使用柴油。能源部长Chris Wright在这方面非常出色，我认为他正在努力解决所有这些问题，以便我们能真正做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but if you could again just like um if you could shed that like 40 hours a year of peak load to backup uh then you would be able to free up 80 80 gigawatts which is a lot. Um and that would definitely get us through the next you know two or three years until the gas turbine bottleneck's been alleviated. Um and then eventually you get to to nuclear. Uh so that would be very good. I think um the the issue there is just there's a whole bunch of insane regulations preventing uh you know load shedding. So like for example, you can't use diesel. Um and uh this you know uh Chris Wright who's the secretary of energy is is very good on all this stuff and I think he's working on unraveling all of this so we could actually uh actually do this.</p>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 是的，我们的观点是，首先我们必须赢得AI竞赛。我们希望美国在这个关键领域领先，这对我们的经济和国家安全至关重要。怎么做呢？我们的公司必须成功，因为它们是创新的主体。你不可能通过监管来赢得AI竞赛。我不是说我们不需要任何监管，但重点是，那不是决定我们是否能成为赢家的因素。

It's like fundamental for our economy and our national security. How do you do that? Well, our companies have to be successful because they're the ones who do the innovation. Again, you're not going to regulate your way to winning the AI race. I'm not saying we don't need any regulations, but the point is just that's not how that's not what's going to determine whether we're the winners or not.</p>

**主持人：** 你最近发推说，基于比尔·盖茨最近的评论，“气候末日论”可能正在让位于“AI末日论”。你这话是什么意思？

<p class="english-text">David, you recently tweeted that climate dumerism perhaps is giving way to AI dumerism based on, you know, Bill Bill Gates recent comments. Um, what do you mean by this?

</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为左派需要一个核心的灾难叙事来为他们接管经济、监管一切，特别是控制信息空间提供理由。我认为你正在看到，整个气候变化末日论的吸引力已经消退。也许是因为他们十年前预测十年后整个世界都会被水淹没，而这并没有发生。到了一定程度，你会被自己灾难性的预测所证伪。我怀疑几年后我们对AI末日论也会是这样。但在此期间，这是一个非常好的叙事，可以取代气候末日论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I think the left needs a central organizing catastrophe to justify their uh takeover of the economy and to to regulate everything and especially to control the information space. Uh and I think that you're seeing that kind of the allure of the whole climate change doomer narrative has kind of faded. Maybe it's the fact that they predicted 10 years ago that the whole world would be underwater in 10 years and that hasn't happened. So it's like at a certain point you get discredited by your own catastrophic predictions. I suspect that's where we'll be with AI dumerism in a few years. But in the meantime, it's a really good narrative to kind of take the place of the climate dumerism.</p>
</details>

随着AI触及越来越多的事物，越来越多的经济领域，每个企业都会在某种程度上使用它。如果你能监管AI，那就能让你对许多其他事物拥有很大的控制权。正如我提到的，AI正在吞噬互联网，成为你获取信息的主要方式。所以，如果你能控制AI向人们展示的内容，你就能控制他们看到、听到和想到的东西。这与左派从未放弃的审查议程相吻合，与他们给孩子洗脑的议程相吻合，也就是整个“觉醒”文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as AI touches more and more things, more and more parts of the economy, every business is going to use it to some degree. If you can regulate AI, then that kind of gives you a lot of control over lots of of other things. And like I mentioned, AI is kind of eating the internet. It's like the main way that you're getting information. So again, if you can kind of get your hooks into what the AI is showing people, now you can control what they see and hear and think. uh which dovetales with the whole with the left censorship, you know, agenda, which they've never given up on. Uh dovetales with their agenda to brainwash kids, uh which we, you know, which is kind of the whole woke thing.</p>
</details>

在拜登执政期间，他们基本上说服了所有主要的拜登幕僚，让他们相信这种“迫在眉睫的超级智能即将来临，我们应该非常害怕它，我们需要巩固对它的控制”的观点。他们说，一旦我们确保只有两三家美国公司拥有它，我们就能解决协调问题，控制整个事情，防止精灵从瓶子里跑出来。我认为这是一个完全偏执的版本，而且它已经在被证伪的过程中。但这个愿景从根本上激发了拜登的AI行政命令和“拜登扩散规则”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">They basically convinced all of the major Biden staffers of this um view of this like imminent super intelligence is coming. We should be really afraid of it.

That's what they consider to be the, you know, the free market. Uh we'll solve those coordination problems for buying those um companies and we'll be able to control this whole thing and prevent the the genie from escaping the bottle. I think it was like this totally paranoid version of what would happen. And it's already being it's already in the process of being refuted. But this this vision is fundamentally what animated the Biden executive order on AI. It's what animated the Biden diffusion rule.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 他们曾明确告诉我们，他们将禁止开源。当我们质疑他们禁止开源的能力时——因为我们谈论的是数学，是教科书和YouTube视频里教的数学算法——他们说：“冷战期间，我们禁止了整个物理学领域，把它们列为禁区，如果需要，我们也会对数学做同样的事情。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">yeah, they told us that they told us that explicitly. Um and uh yeah, and they told us exactly what you just said. They told us they're going to ban open source.

Um, you know, they they they said we'll during the Cold War, we banned entire areas of physics um and put them off limits and we'll do the same thing for math if we have to.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 是的，这正是他们的叙事。你有一种迫在眉睫的超级智能，然后你听到的一个反复出现的说法是，AI就像核武器，GPU就像铀或钚。因此，监管这个问题的正确方式是建立一个类似国际原子能机构的组织。所以一切都将是中心化的、受控的，他们会指定两三个赢家。

</details>

我认为这个叙事在DeepSeek发布后真正开始瓦解。如果你问这些人，当我们通过过度监管自废武功时，中国难道不会赢得AI竞赛吗？他们会说，中国远远落后于我们，没关系。而且，他们毫无根据地声称，如果我们放慢脚步实施这些所谓健康的法规，中国也会复制我们的做法。我认为这是一个极其天真的观点。如果我们自废武功，中国只会说：“非常感谢，我们就接管这项技术的领导地位了。”

<p class="english-text">Now this I think this narrative really started to fall apart uh with the launch of DeepSeek which really happened in the first I don't know couple weeks of the Trump administration because you know if you asked any of these people what they thought of um of China during this time when they were pushing all these regulations they basically you know and specifically well wait if if we shoot ourselves in the foot by overregulating AI you know won't China just win the AI race if you were to ask them that what they what they would have said they did say is that China is so far behind us it doesn't matter. And furthermore, uh, and this was said completely without evidence that if we basically slow down to impose, you know, all these supposedly healthy regulations, well, China will just copy us and do the same thing. I think it was an absurdly naive view. I think that if we shoot ourselves in the foot, China will just be like, "Thank you very much. We'll just take leadership in this technology. Uh, why wouldn't we?"</p>

**主持人：** 回到加密货币。本届政府和国家在今年早些时候取得了重大胜利，总统签署了稳定币法案（Genius Act）成为法律。我们看到，该法律的积极影响甚至比我们想象的还要大。这不仅对稳定币行业如此，现在你看到各种金融机构都在以一种前所未有的方式拥抱稳定币。同时，这也向整个加密货币行业发出了一个信号，即这真的是新的一天。现在正在制定第二部立法，即市场结构法案（Clarity Act）。我想知道你对该法案重要性的看法。

<p class="english-text">Right. So David just to uh come back real quick while we still have you on on crypto. Um so the administration um and I think the country had a significant victory uh earlier this year with the president signing the u stablecoin bill into law uh which was the the genius act. Um and I I think that I'll just tell you what we see is like the positive consequences of that law have been even bigger than we thought. Um and I would say that's both for the stable coin industry and you now see actually a lot of a lot of financial institutions of all kinds embracing stable coins um in a way that that they weren't before. um and you know sort of the the the phenomenon spreading in America you know by the way doing you know being being in the lead and doing very well there. Um but but but just also more broadly just as a signal to the crypto industry that like this you know this really is a you know this really is a new day. Um and there really there really are going to be regulatory frameworks that that make these things possible and and and you know that that are responsible but also make this industry really possible to flourish. um and in the US um as you know there's a second piece of legislation um you know being constructed right now which is the market structure bill uh called the the clarity act um which is sort of the phase two of the legislative agenda um and I wondered maybe if you could just tell us a little bit about your view of of the importance of that of that bill and and then you know kind of how do you think that process is going</p>

**大卫·萨克斯：** 我认为这极其重要。正如你提到的，我们几个月前通过了Genius Act，但那只针对稳定币。稳定币约占代币总市值的6%。所以94%是所有其他类型的代币，而Clarity Act将适用于所有这些，并为所有其他加密项目和公司提供监管框架。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it's extremely important um so as you mentioned we we passed the the Genius Act few few months ago but that was just for stable coins stable coins are about 6% of the total market cap in terms of tokens. So 94% are all the other types of tokens and the Clarity Act would apply to all of that and provide the regulatory framework for all those other crypto projects and companies.</p>

如果我们能确保像Paul Atkins这样优秀的人永远担任SEC主席，那么我们不一定需要立法，因为他们已经在实施更好的规则并提供监管清晰度。但事实是我们无法确定。如果你是一个创始人，现在正试图决定在哪里建立你的公司，你希望有未来10年、20年的确定性。我们希望鼓励长期项目，所以我认为将规则写入立法，以提供清晰度和长期稳定性非常重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, you know, if we could be sure that, you know, currently we have a great SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, and if we could be sure that Paul Atkins and a person like Paul Atkins was always at the SEC forever, then we wouldn't necessarily need legislation because they're already in the process of implementing like much better rules and providing regulatory clarity. But the truth is that we don't know for sure. And if you're a founder who's trying to make a decision now about where you're going to build your company, you want to have certainty for 10 years out, 20 years out. uh you know we want to encourage long-term projects and so again I think it's very important to pro to canonize uh the the the rules that that's first to provide the clarity and then to make sure there's enough stability around them and sort of canonize those rules in legislation. That's the only way that you provide that long-term stability.</p>

我认为我们会完成Clarity Act。它在众议院以大约300票通过，其中包括约78名民主党人，所以是实质性的两党合作。我认为它最终会完成。我们正在与大约十几名民主党人谈判。我们需要达到60票，这是难点。但我确实认为我们最终会达到那个数字。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think that we will get the Clarity Act done. Like you mentioned it passed the House with about 300 votes of about 78 Democrats. So it was substantially bipartisan. I think it will ultimat we're it's now going through the Senate. Um I think it will ultimately get done. Uh we're negotiating with a dozen or so Democrat. We have to get to 60 votes. So that's the the hard part is under the filibuster. We got to get to 60. Uh so but we're negotiating with about a dozen Democrats. And I I do think that we will ultimately get to to that number.</p>

特朗普总统的当选使一切成为可能。他对行业的承诺以及他兑现选举期间承诺的决心，使这一切成为可能。他也直接参与确保Genius Act的通过。这项立法曾多次被宣布死亡。我亲眼看到他如何说服关键选票，软硬兼施，最终完成了任务。我认为Clarity Act也会有类似的结果。

<p class="english-text">President Trump's election made everything possible. And it's his commitment to the industry and he and his commitment to keeping his um promises during the election that's made all of this possible. But also I mean he got directly involved in making sure the Genius Act passed. It was the legislation was declared dead many times. Uh I saw it with my own eyes that you know he was able to persuade um Rick Calstrren votes and uh twist arms cajul uh and um charm and um you know he ultimately got it done and um and I think that clarity will be a similar result.</p>

### 城市治理的挑战：以旧金山为例

**主持人：** 最近在旧金山的一期All-In播客中，你支持引入国民警卫队。考虑到教学时刻，我很好奇你是否认为旧金山还有救，如果可以，需要满足什么条件才能实现？

<p class="english-text">La lastly, um we were just talking about New York. Um recently in an episode all in in San Francisco, you you you know endorsed bringing the the National Guard. You know, Ben off had his comments. He he sort of, you know, went back and forth with those comments. I'm curious if speaking of teaching moments, I'm curious if you see San Francisco as savable in in some sense and and what what needs to be true to to get there if so.</p>
</details>

**大卫·萨克斯：** Daniel Lurie是我们几十年来最好的市长。我认为他在旧金山所提供的限制条件下做得非常好。不幸的是，旧金山的市长权力很弱。监事会有很大的权力，而且随着时间的推移，他们已经能够将权力从市长转移到自己手中。然后你还有所有那些左翼法官。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, Daniel Luri is the best mayor we've had in decades. So, I think he's doing a very good job um within the constraints that San Francisco presents. Uh so, the the the the mayor job, unfortunately, we have a weak mayor in San Francisco. I I don't mean him, I just mean like the way it's all set up. the board of supervisors has, you know, a ton of power and um over time they've been able to kind of transfer power from the mayor to to themselves. Um and then of course you got all these leftwing judges.</p>

Troy McAlister的案子，他是一名惯犯，在2020年新年前夜杀害了两个人。他在那之前的一年里被逮捕了四次。他本应在监狱里，但他基本上是因为时任地区检察官Chesa Boudin的零保释金政策而被释放的。我们后来罢免了Boudin。即使在旧金山，要罢免一个政治家，你得有多左才能疏远旧金山，而Chesa Boudin成功地做到了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean, it's just amazing to me that um there's a case right now, this is a case that galvanized me several years ago, the case of Troy Mallister who was a repeat offender who uh killed pe two people on New Year's Eve. I think it was like uh 2020. Uh and um he was arrested four times, you know, uh in the year before that. Uh he he he ended up killing these two people and he had a very very long criminal history. He had committed armed robbery before, stolen many cars. Uh and he should have been in jail. He should not have been released. But he was basically released thanks to the zero bail policies of Chase Bodin, who was then the district attorney who we got recalled. There was a huge outcry. I mean, even in San Francisco for there to be a recall of a polit I mean, you got to be like seriously leftwing to um recall to basically alienate San Francisco and Chase Bin managed to be so far out there that he alienated even San Francisco.</p>
</details>

然而，我不知道为什么Troy McAlister还没有被判刑并入狱20年以上，他的案子还在法院里没完没了地审理。还有一个左翼法官正在考虑只给他一个转处（diversion），基本上就是戴个脚踝监视器就释放了。这太疯狂了。这就是我们在旧金山要处理的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yet, I don't know why Tory Mallister isn't sentenced already and in jail for 20 years plus, but his case is still pending through the courts, never ending. And there's a leftwing judge who's considering just giving him diversion. basically means you just get released maybe with an ankle bracelet or something. Um, that's insane. So, I mean, that's what we're dealing with in San Francisco.</p>
</details>

所以我只是想，Daniel是否面临太多的限制？因此，我知道他不想让总统派国民警卫队进来，但也许最终这会有所帮助。但无论如何，我认为总统已经同意暂时搁置此事。Daniel与总统进行了一次很好的交谈，并请求他暂缓行动，总统同意了，并给他时间来实施他的解决方案。如果Daniel和他的团队能够在没有国民警卫队介入的情况下继续取得进展并解决问题，那就再好不过了。我们拭目以待。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean, like crazy leftwing judges who want to release all the criminals. Uh, and um, you know, and so I just wonder like is Daniel up against too many constraints and therefore I know he doesn't want the president to send in the National Guard, but maybe ultimately it would be helpful. Um but in any event, I think the president has has agreed to kind of hold off on that um out of you, you know, Daniel had a good conversation with the president and asked him to hold back and um and you know, the president uh agreed and is giving him time to implement his solutions. And look, if if um if Daniel and his team can keep making progress and fix the problems without the National Guard having to come in, then so much the better. Um, we'll just see if and and I know he wants to and like I said, he's the best mayor we've had in decades. It's just a question of whether he'll be too constrained by the other powers that be in the city.</p>
