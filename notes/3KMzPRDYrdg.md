### 播客引言：美中关系的视角与对话

欢迎收听新一期的**Odd Lots**（Odd Lots: 彭博社旗下的一档财经播客）播客。主持人乔·魏森塔尔（Joe Weisenthal）和特雷西·阿洛韦（Tracy Alloway）指出，美中关系是他们节目中经常讨论的话题，通常会从美国的视角出发，但这可能存在地域和语言上的偏差。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, you know, we talk all the time about USChina relations multiple times a month, it seems, for obvious reasons. We, you know, we usually get it from something resembling a US perspective. Not always, but I think it's a bit skewed. Yeah, there is a geographic bias at play for sure and a linguistic one. Yes, but you're right. There is always a lot going on with USChina relations and especially recently. Right.</p>
</details>

他们提到，就在录制节目的9月16日，中美官员正在马德里举行贸易会谈，试图就关税问题达成协议。然而，他们对此持怀疑态度，认为美中关系短期内不太可能发生根本性改变，贸易焦虑、TikTok协议等问题可能还会持续很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're recording this on September 16th, and we have Chinese and American officials gathering in I think it's Madrid to talk trade, try to hammer out some sort of deal on the tariffs. By the time this episode comes out, maybe USChina relations will have changed completely, but uh somehow I doubt it. There's going to be some new era of peace. Everything is going to be solved. There's going to be no more anxiety about trade. a Tik Tok deal will have been made with the perfect algorithm that satisfies everyone everything. No, probably unlikely. Probably we are going to be talking about some version of this for a long time.</p>
</details>

主持人强调，尽管他们也曾采访过在中国工作的专家如卡梅隆·约翰逊（Cameron Johnson），但为了更全面地了解情况，他们需要改变对话的构成。他们希望通过对话建立多方视角，以期达成更大的目标，甚至开玩笑说希望能在2026年在北京进行一次现场播客录制，以促进中美对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to say, you know, it's not like our perspectives are just strictly US. You know, we talked to Cameron Johnson who works in China regular. So, it's not none, but we obviously have to uh change the mixup. I admire your efforts at being unpartisan. Well, crossborder, you know, we have to still do it via Zoom obviously, but isn't this a long historic trend to try to like build build dialogue between multiple sides and get multiple perspectives in the hopes of achieving something bigger than that? What I'm going to say is we need to go to Beijing mostly for the food, but also for uh inter US China dialogue. The dream is that in 2026 we host a live it's in Beijing. We're putting it out into the world right now in the hope that we can manifest it into existence. Yes.</p>
</details>

为了实现这一目标，他们邀请了**中国与全球化智库**（Center for China and Globalization: 中国最大的独立智库）的创始人兼总裁王辉耀博士作为嘉宾。王博士被认为是讨论这些话题的理想人选，能够提供通常难以获得的中国视角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Well, I am really excited to say that in these efforts, we really do have the perfect guest. We are going to be speaking with uh Henry Wong. He is the founder and president for the Center for China and Globalization. It's the largest independent think tank in China. Someone perfectly placed to talk about all of these topics from a Chinese perspective that we don't usually get. So, Henry, thank you so much for uh coming on the podcast. Thank you. Yeah, my pleasure.</p>
</details>

### 中国与全球化智库的创立与使命

主持人询问了**中国与全球化智库**（CCG）的创立背景、目标及其作为独立智库的定位。王辉耀博士介绍说，该智库成立于2008年北京奥运会之后。当时奥运会的口号是“**同一个世界，同一个梦想**”（One World, One Dream: 2008年北京奥运会口号），这让他意识到全球化以及中国进入全球化时代的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the center for China and globalization? Why did you found it? What is its goal? What is this independent think tank that exists? Yes, we actually founded uh since 208 actually. Yeah. Right after the Beijing Olympics. You know, at that time, you know, when we watched the Beijing Olympic, the slogan for the Olympics then was one word, one dream. So we thought that that is actually it's a globalization and uh and China actually embarked on a globalization era because I think Olympic Beijing Olympic in 208 was something that China starting to really looking globally and uh so that's where we we start to found this uh think tank at first I have to take out a lot of savings you know I was doing a lot of business before but we really want to start this but I I really have found this think tank to kind of combine my experience in a government business and academic.</p>
</details>

他表示，创立智库的初衷是为了结合他在政府、商业和学术领域的经验。经过17、18年的发展，CCG已成为全球百强智库之一，并多次被宾夕法尼亚大学智库与公民社会项目评为全球顶尖智库。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And also you know since then it's 17 18 years now and we become one of the top 100 think tank in the world actually ranked four times in the top country by the University of Pennsylvania think tank and service society program.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士将CCG描述为一个“桥梁”，一个沟通和对话的平台，同时也是一个研究平台，专注于美中关系、全球治理、全球经济以及全球移民等重大政策问题。CCG目前拥有60至70名员工，在北京、杭州、广州等地设有基地，每年举办100多场活动，出版数十本书籍和多份报告，非常活跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so so CCG you know abbreviation for center for China global is a bridge is a communication platform dialogue platform and also it's a research platform for uh big issues policy issues uh regarding US and China global governance uh global economy and of course global migration so just to name a few but uh but since then we've been doing okay we had about over uh 60 70 people and we we've been based in Beijing and Hjo and and Guangjo a few places in China and uh we've been very active. We're doing a 100 event a year. We publish a dozen books and multiple reports. So, so thank you for for for asking that. M so uh you described the center as something of a bridge and I was reading an economist article from a couple years ago where you yourself are described as something of a gobetween for technocratic government ministries, Chinese entrepreneurs and foreign embassies in Beijing. So my question is how busy have you been lately?</p>
</details>

### 繁忙的外交与对话日程

主持人提到《经济学人》曾将王辉耀博士描述为中国技术官僚政府部门、中国企业家和外国驻京使馆之间的“中间人”，并询问他最近是否非常忙碌。王博士表示确实如此，并列举了几个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are pretty busy. I just give you a few examples. For example, last week I was in Shaman attending September 8 the 25 annual China uh investment and business forum and expo there and the vice premier Hurong who is now in Madrid talking with Scott Benson was there uh opening up that forum and uh so I was speaking at a keynote speaker at one of the bricks summit uh conference there but also just uh Friday uh senator of a China government hold another conference at uh China international service expo you know held in Beijing uh where there's another 100 some countries come as well and uh yesterday we had our 17th monthly VIP launching and we have a 10 ambassadors from European from Japan from Turkey from many other countries quite a number from European countries and just yesterday with 50 people also IMF representative in China. We have a lot of multinational global media and also of course uh last night I attended a relevant reception. The US embassy hold a reception welcoming the new deputy head of the mission Mr. Greg and and he actually made an excellent speech there. He said uh China and US relation now rather than in the past I mean you know I I know that in the past we had a lot of strategic rivalry but the new head of new deputy head of the US mission here in China and said now we should put strategic stability he's not talking about strategic arrival so strategic stability in maintaining US China relation and secretary rubio also said that in July so it's very encouraging to see I going on. But that's also shows how busy we are meeting all the peoples and talking to all the parties and and business too.</p>
</details>

他提到，上周他参加了在厦门举行的第25届中国国际投资贸易洽谈会，并作为**金砖国家**（BRICS: 巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国、南非五个主要新兴市场国家组成的合作机制）峰会分论坛的主旨发言人。中国副总理胡荣（Hurong）也在该论坛上发表了讲话。此外，他还参加了在北京举行的中国国际服务贸易交易会，有100多个国家参会。

<details>

</details>

王博士还透露，他们最近举办了第17次月度VIP发布会，有来自欧洲、日本、土耳其等多个国家的10位大使以及**国际货币基金组织**（IMF: International Monetary Fund: 致力于促进全球货币合作、金融稳定、国际贸易、高就业和可持续经济增长的国际组织）的中国代表等50多人参加。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and uh yesterday we had our 17th monthly VIP launching and we have a 10 ambassadors from European from Japan from Turkey from many other countries quite a number from European countries and just yesterday with 50 people also IMF representative in China. We have a lot of multinational global media and also of course uh last night I attended a relevant reception.</p>
</details>

他还参加了美国大使馆为新任副馆长格雷格（Greg）举行的招待会。格雷格在讲话中强调，美中关系应着眼于“战略稳定”而非过去的“战略竞争”，这与美国国务卿鲁比奥（Rubio）在7月的表态一致，令人鼓舞。这些活动都表明了CCG在促进国际交流和对话方面的繁忙程度。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The US embassy hold a reception welcoming the new deputy head of the mission Mr. Greg and and he actually made an excellent speech there.

But that's also shows how busy we are meeting all the peoples and talking to all the parties and and business too.</p>
</details>

### 美中关系的演变：从稳定到竞争

主持人乔·魏森塔尔表示，尽管官员们谈论“战略稳定”，但从新闻头条来看，美中关系并不稳定，尤其是在特朗普政府时期，关系显得动荡不安。他问道，抛开官方言论，美中关系的发展轨迹是否真的趋向稳定？他个人感觉，过去十年，尤其是他年轻时，美中关系更趋稳定，而现在则更多是竞争和潜在冲突的焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I get that various people might describe an ambition for stability. It does not typically feel like it when I read the headlines that this is a stable relationship for various reasons, particularly the headlines that come out of the Trump administration, which strike me as volatile. Setting aside what you hear from officials whether at the embassy or um the state department, does it feel like that is the trajectory? Cuz it certainly feels especially over the last 10 years that when I was younger the relationship felt something more like stability and that these days it's much more about rivalry and anxiety about potential conflict.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士对此表示同意，他认为自2017年特朗普政府上台以来，美中关系确实恶化了很多。2017年，美国国家安全委员会发布了一份战略报告，将中国列为头号“战略竞争对手”，甚至排在俄罗斯之前。此后，两国爆发了贸易战和关税战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. I I agree with you. I think that basically because of uh uh this deterioration since the first Trump administration you know 2017 uh and now 8 years later the the region does really go down quite a lot already and because in the 2017 the national security committee of US has put out a strategic report and according a strategic rivalry number one I mean before Russia actually so so we see that since then we had a trade war and the tariff war.</p>
</details>

然而，他指出，在特朗普的第二个任期内，中国对这种关税和贸易战已经“习以为常”，并做好了更充分的准备，因为他们已经经历过第一个任期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this second term somehow we I felt uh well in China uh it bit more uh you know getting used to this kind of a tariff trade war and China is also better prepared than the other countries because we already experienced in the first Trump administration.</p>
</details>

王博士认为，鉴于中国经济已是世界第二大经济体，两国之间存在高度相互依存。尽管地缘政治局势看起来非常糟糕，但两国政府的共识是需要寻求稳定。因为两国无法改变或“删除”对方，必须和平共处。他总结说，即使存在许多不同的观点和想法，也必须寻求共同点，实现共存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so now I think also China economy is is is second only to the US. the two countries has too much independence among each other and uh so you know because geopolitically we are really looking very bad and then I think the consensus on both government is that we need to look for some stability because we can't change each other we cannot wipe you know delete each other we we have to coexist peacefully and that's probably the conclusion that we're we're getting there and so we have to uh seek a common ground and coexisting even we are having a lot of different views and ideas.</p>
</details>

### 中国对全球化的理解：经济优先

主持人特雷西·阿洛韦提出，美中两国经济相互依存度高，这在21世纪初的全球化进程中尤为明显。她想知道中国对全球化的定义或理解是什么，因为西方普遍认为全球化是各国之间贸易增加、经济相互依存加深的过程，同时伴随着政治和社会价值观的共享。她好奇中国是否也以同样的方式看待全球化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you mentioned just then the idea of the world's two biggest economies being more dependent on each other. Um perhaps less so nowadays but over I guess the decades of the early 2000s um certainly they grew more dependent on each other because of globalization. And this is something that I wanted to ask you which is what exactly is China's definition or understanding of globalization? And I ask this because I think in the west it's sort of generally thought of as this process of more countries trading with each other and again becoming more economically dependent on each other. But there's also this sort of social element that's also in there because I think the assumption was always that as countries trade more with each other they're going to start sharing you know values um whether those are political or social. And I'm curious if globalization is thought of the same way in China.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士解释说，中国是全球化的“后来者”。他回顾了19世纪英国蒸汽动力引发的工业革命和20世纪美国互联网、计算机引领的数字化浪潮。他认为，21世纪中国在绿色能源领域，如电动汽车、太阳能电池板和风能方面正在崛起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think that uh uh in China because it was a late commerce, you know, uh uh for example, you see the globalization in the 19th century which is uh you know uh Britain invented steam power that led the industrial revolution in the 19th century and 20th century American invented you know internet computers and and digital and US is led in the 20th century. I think 21st century China is is also you know coming up now for example on the green power China is leading on EVs on on the solar panels and and also the wind power and all the same.</p>
</details>

他指出，在中国人的观念中，全球化更多地指的是“经济全球化”。因为中国从中获得了巨大的利益，例如自改革开放以来，中国已使8亿人摆脱贫困。中国现在是与全球157个国家进行贸易的最大贸易国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in the globalization concept in the Chinese mind is really more referred to the economic globalization because uh because that's the benefit they're getting uh substantially for example 800 million people has been lifted out of poverty since China embraced opening up basically embraced the globalization And then uh you can see China now is the largest trading nation or major trading nation with 157 countries around the world.</p>
</details>

此外，自改革开放47年来，中国有近1000万学生出国留学，其中近一半在美国。王博士认为，全球化意味着人才、商品、互联网连接、股票市场互联互通以及商业活动（例如7万家美国公司在中国运营，创造7000亿美元收入；苹果80%-90%的iPhone在中国制造；特斯拉50%的电动汽车在中国制造；沃尔玛60%的商品从中国采购）的流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also furthermore uh China is uh have since opening up in the last uh 47 years. China has about almost 10 million student study abroad. I mean almost half of that in the United States. So that means globalization. I think there's a there a flow of people, flow of talent, uh flow of goods uh you know internet connectivities uh fast uh uh you know stock market exchange listed with each other uh and also business doing you know there are 70,000 US company uh operating in China and generating 700 billion revenues here in China and uh uh and also uh you know Apple make 80 90% of iPhone in China and Tesla make 50% of its EV cars in China and Walmart purchase about 60% of its supplies from China.</p>
</details>

他认为，中国从中获得了巨大的经济利益，这不仅惠及中国人，也惠及美国消费者。中国对全球化的理解较少意识形态化，更多地侧重于经济层面带来的好处。例如，自2001年加入**世界贸易组织**（WTO: World Trade Organization: 旨在促进国际贸易自由化的政府间国际组织）以来，中国的**国内生产总值**（GDP: Gross Domestic Product: 衡量一个国家或地区在一定时期内生产的所有最终商品和服务的市场价值）增长了13到14倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that that's probably the coin China felt the substantial benefit uh probably for both Chinese and also American consumers. They are less ideological but they're more probably uh on economic sense that uh uh globalization is really bring them a lot of good and benefit. For example, since China joined the WTO in 20 2011, China's GDP has gone up 13 14 times. So that really I think in in the minds of Chinese when they talk about globalization, they're really uh talking about join uh economic globalization rather than the sec global securization.</p>
</details>

因此，当中国人谈论全球化时，他们主要指的是经济全球化，而非全球安全化。他们不希望看到**澳英美安全协议**（AUKUS: Australia, United Kingdom, United States security pact: 澳大利亚、英国和美国之间的一项三边安全协议）或**四方安全对话**（Quad: Quadrilateral Security Dialogue: 美国、日本、印度和澳大利亚之间的非正式战略对话）或**戴维营**（Camp David: 位于美国马里兰州的总统度假地，此处指美日韩三边峰会）这样的安全联盟，也不希望看到**北约**（NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization: 北大西洋公约组织，一个军事联盟）向亚洲扩张，那种军事化的全球化。他们更希望看到经济全球化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They don't want to see the arcus. They don't want to see the quad. They don't want to see camp David of Korea, Japan and all those security or or NATO moving to Asia. that kind of a militarized globalization. They want to see more economic globalization.</p>
</details>

### 中国在全球冲突中的潜在维和角色

主持人特雷西·阿洛韦提到，她个人从中国留学生带来的中餐馆热潮中受益匪浅，并希望这一趋势继续下去。随后，她将话题转向安全角度。她指出，王辉耀博士最近撰文称，中国可以在俄罗斯与乌克兰战争的最终和平解决中发挥作用。然而，人们通常不认为中国政府会在远离其边境的全球冲突中扮演积极角色，包括以色列与加沙冲突。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a huge personal beneficiary of these students abroad living in the East Village where there's been an absolute explosion of amazing Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood of New York City because there are so many students there. So, I'm personally very invested in this trend continuing. But let's talk a little bit more about the security angle. You've actually written somewhat recently that China could play some role in the eventual hopeful end of Russia's war with Ukraine. But we don't tend to associate the Chinese government with playing an active role in global conflicts not directly near the borders including Israel and Gaza which we uh should talk about too.</p>
</details>

她问道，中国是否会像美国或西方主导的全球化那样，在远离其直接边境的冲突中扮演更积极的促和角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when it comes to something, you know, when it comes to the Russia Ukraine war that tends to be focused on, okay, the Europeans, the role that US will play, is there going to be a point in the near future, or is there something we're missing where China sees this conflict that is far from its direct borders and wants to play a more activist role in bringing peace? Or is this something that is only associated with the sort of American style, Westernled style of globalization?</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士表示，世界正在进入一个多极化时代，中国无疑是其中一极。他提到，今年早些时候他在柏林参加慕尼黑安全会议的启动会议时，与会者发布了一份关于“多极世界”的报告，他参与了讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think that's probably uh now the world is I mean I was at uh Munich Security Conference uh kickoff meeting in Berlin early this year uh with the chairman of Munich Security Conference. They issued a report. I was discussing on that report they called multipolarity. So we are getting into multipolar war. I mean China certainly become one of of this multipolar war.</p>
</details>

他指出，俄乌战争陷入僵局。在阿拉斯加峰会前两天，他在《外交政策》杂志上发表了一篇评论文章，建议如果美国国防部长在慕尼黑安全会议上表示希望欧洲国家和非欧洲国家派遣维和部队，那么这些非欧洲国家可以是**金砖国家**（BRICS），如中国、印度、巴西、南非或土耳其等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you can see what happened in the in the Russian Ukraine war there. It's getting nowhere. We had the Alaska summit. Uh that's why I published an op at the foreign policy two days before the Alaska summit. Basically, I suggest that uh if US defense secretary, I heard him saying at the Munich security conference that they want peacemaking troops coming from European countries and non-European countries. So what mean by non-European countries? So I think that uh countries could be this brick countries from uh China, India, Brazil, you know, South Africa or Turkey, whatever bricks countries.</p>
</details>

他观察到，在阿拉斯加会谈后，特朗普与**七国集团**（G7: Group of Seven: 由七个主要发达国家组成的政府间政治论坛）在白宫会谈，而普京在阿拉斯加会谈前与习主席、卢拉和莫迪（Lula, Moody）通话，并在会谈后与南非总统通话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But basically again you see that when Trump actually after the Alaska talking to G7 at White House, Putin actually talked to to President She before his Alaska and talked to Lula, talked to Moody and talked to the president of South Africa after the Alaska.</p>
</details>

王博士提到，最近有人提议向乌克兰派遣26个欧洲国家的军队，但这遭到了俄罗斯的强烈反对，普京表示这将视为**北约**（NATO）的侵犯。他认为，普京发动战争的借口是北约军队逼近俄罗斯边境，如果三年半后再次出现北约欧洲军队，战争将难以轻易结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that I I recently seen Mong proposing that let's have 26 European countries troops placed into Ukraine but that get very strong reaction from Russia that Putin said okay if that is the case that we regard it as as a NATO violation or something. So we see that the excuse for Putin to start the war is because the NATO troops approaching uh Russian border. I mean after three and a half years fight I mean you have a NATO European troops there again. I mean he will not probably ending that war easily.</p>
</details>

因此，除了北约、欧盟和美国之外，还需要额外的和平保障。他建议让中国、印度、巴西这些俄罗斯能源产品的最大买家参与进来，提供额外的边境安全保障。他认为，如果中国维和部队部署在那里，俄罗斯将难以违反和平边界，因为中国对俄罗斯有很大的影响力，印度和巴西也一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think a more extra guarantee for this peacemaking in addition to NATO, EU and and also US. Let's get China, India, Brazil, those the largest buyers of of Russian energy product and and what else is really extra safekeeping for the for the border and then by having Chinese peacekeeping force there it will really uh you know make you know make Russia difficult to violate that peace border because you know China has a lot of influence on Russia. Same for India, same for Brazil. So, so I think that uh we are in the risk this we're stuck in this uh you know Trump says you know he started sanctioning again you're not going anywhere but I think by adding the China bricks element we probably see a more security piece that's going to happen.</p>
</details>

### 中国的世界角色：和平竞争与文化根源

主持人询问，抛开经济因素，中国在全球地缘政治安全方面希望扮演怎样的角色。王辉耀博士解释说，中国是一个大国，但其文化根源是农业文明，拥有5000年的不间断文明史，农民沿长江和黄河耕作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does China actually think its role in the world should be? And we talked about its role economically in the idea of globalization. But setting aside economies when it comes to geopolitical security, what exactly does China want to be? Yes. Well, thank you. I think but basically uh China is is a large country of course, but it's basically agricultural culture. You know, it's basically you have a th 5,000 years history. I interrupt the civilization. It's based on an agricultural economy. The farmers cultivate along the Yans River and the Yellow River.</p>
</details>

他引用孔子的话“父母在不远游”，指出这种文化培养了中国的内敛性。中国不是一个像蒙古人那样骑马远征、殖民他国的民族。他提到郑和下西洋的远航，虽然远至非洲和东南亚，但他们从未在任何地方停留或占领，七次远航都返回了，甚至比哥伦布（Columbus）还要早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Confucious said if your parent alive don't travel far away. And then you can you can only cultivate the land four seasons that they can grow enough vegetables and and and wheat and and grain to to feed yourself. So it's really that kind of a culture cultivated the culture of China. And they are not really a nation on the horses or like Mongols. they're going to have expeditions or going to have a cononalize any places in in the mean that is there was a marshall called Jung had a big expedition trips uh uh beyond almost to Africa also uh uh you know as countries southeast Asia they never they never stayed anywhere they never occupy any places they all returned seven times it was even earlier than Colombia so you see that is really the culture China has until now.</p>
</details>

王博士强调，在过去的40年里，中国没有发动任何战争，没有向任何地方派兵，没有殖民任何地方，也没有入侵任何其他国家。他认为，中国已经建立了足够的威慑力量，足以在任何冲突中自卫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for the last 40 years China hasn't started any war send any soldiers anywhere or colonize any place or invaded any other country. So I I think geopolitically we had this big parade on on September 3rd to commemorate the second world war but I think China has produced enough deterrence so that uh you know probably if they are in any hot conflict they have enough defenses to detering that.</p>
</details>

他认为，如果不能发生核战争或热战导致相互毁灭，那么剩下的只有经济、软实力、文化和人文交流方面的和平竞争。中国希望有一个公平的竞争环境，在经济上进行竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so if we cannot have a nuclear or hot war to mutually assure destruction then the only thing remain is is peaceful competition on economy uh on the soft power on the culture on on the people-to-people exchanges. So I think China wants to really see let's have a level playing field and let's really compete on economic.</p>
</details>

王博士列举了中国在经济和基础设施方面的成就：拥有全球70%的高速铁路、60%的5G网络，全球十大集装箱港口中有七个在中国。中国每年有3000万大学毕业生。在能源方面，中国的电力消耗是美国的2.5倍、欧洲的3倍。在绿色能源方面，中国已生产了1500万至1600万辆电动汽车，总数将达到3000万辆，并拥有1600万个充电站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China now is uh having 70% of global speed railway 60% of 5G networks of the world out of the 10 largest container ports seven of them in China. China also has uh 30 million college graduates every year and uh you know they have a lot of things uh that they're doing on on their own now and also on on energy installation now their electricity consumption is 2.5 times of US three times of Europe now and in terms of green power China has produced 15 16 million EV cars total number of be 30 million and they have a 16 million charge stations in China everywhere you very convenient to charge your EV car now.</p>
</details>

他认为，中国希望在这些领域而非地缘政治上进行竞争。如果中国能发挥维和作用将是极好的，因为中国是联合国维和预算的最大贡献国，也是**联合国安理会**（UN Security Council: 联合国六个主要机构之一，负责维持国际和平与安全）**五常任理事国**（P5: Permanent Five: 联合国安理会的五个常任理事国，即中国、法国、俄罗斯、英国和美国）中派遣维和部队最多的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so I think you know they want to probably compete in those area rather than geopolitically. So I think maybe if China can play some maintain some peacekeeping would be great because China is the largest peacekeeping budget contributor to the UN. China is the largest peacekeeping sending force among the P5 member countries.</p>
</details>

在经济方面，中国发起了许多倡议，如“**一带一路倡议**”（Belt and Road Initiative: 中国提出的旨在加强区域互联互通和经济合作的宏大基础设施和投资项目）。中国还在天津举办了**上海合作组织**（SCO: Shanghai Cooperation Organization: 旨在加强成员国之间政治、经济和安全合作的欧亚政治、经济和安全组织）峰会，并建立了上海合作组织银行和**金砖国家**（BRICS）新开发银行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so if China can do more peacekeeping and also economically you know China launched many initiative uh below initiative uh China just did so uh summit in in Tenzin where they establish so bank they have a breaks bank new development bank so they're doing all this kind of economic stuff uh I think that's how they view the world should be intertwined more uh economically business-wise uh rather than we are really divided according to the ideological uh divided according to democracy versus autocracy and divided by you know this this east or west.</p>
</details>

王博士认为，中国希望世界在经济和商业上更加紧密相连，而不是根据意识形态、民主与专制、东方与西方来划分。

<p class="english-text">So there's many things I think China is is thinking a little differently.</p>
</details>

### 多边主义与全球治理：联合国改革与中国贡献

主持人提到联合国，并提出西方发达多边组织（如**世界贸易组织**和联合国）的活力和相关性问题。他问道，是应该为这些组织注入新生命，还是需要一套新的组织（包括中国自己建立的，如“一带一路”、**金砖国家**等）来适应新的全球化模式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned the United Nations and there's sort of this question about the relevance or the vitality of a lot of these western developed multilateral organizations WTO being among them but UN specifically in your vision maybe it's China's vision or maybe there's uh distinct is it important to breathe new life into these organizations or is there a new set of organizations including some of the ones that China has set up itself Whether it's the Barri, whether we're talking about the bricks, whether we're talking about some of these others, is the future more okay, if we're going to have this sort of new style of globalization, we actually genuinely need new organizations rather than the husks of the organizations that were sort of built out of the western liberal order.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士表示完全同意，并提到他最近与哈佛大学肯尼迪学院创始院长格雷厄姆·艾利森（Graham Allison）对话的著作在中国非常畅销。在对话中，他们将美中关系比作“连体双胞胎”，无法分离，如果试图分离，只会伤害自己。因此，应该避免艾利森著名的“**修昔底德陷阱**”（Thucydides Trap: 指一个崛起中的大国必然会挑战现有霸主，而现有霸主也必然会回应这种威胁，从而导致战争的理论），同时也应避免“**金德尔伯格陷阱**”（Kindleberger Trap: 指当一个新兴大国崛起并赶超现有大国时，全球公共产品会出现真空，可能导致全球经济衰退和动荡）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I I think that's that's quite true. I had I I have recently recently uh wrote a book uh about my dialogue with Graham Madison, the founding de of Harvard Kennedy School which become a very good sale in China. And also English wise basically we find that in our dialogue we we talk about US China relation as as conjun twins you know we cannot separate each other you know if we want to separate each other we we end up damage ourselves so so that's the given so we should avoid this hijis trap that grand medicine famously defined but also on the other hand we should also avoid the kinder trap which means that when a new rising power starting to catching up existing number one power there's a vacuum in the global public goods like when US was taking place UK there's a lot of missing linking points you know we got big recession in the in the in the 30 1930s and things like that.</p>
</details>

他指出，美国目前的政策倾向于“美国优先”，而没有国家真正关注全球公共产品。中国正在填补这一空白，例如中国没有退出气候变化协议，并大力支持，在气候友好型环境发展方面取得了显著进展，提前实现了碳中和与碳达峰目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so China actually is US is now put a bit back on its policy now it's become a mega you know make me first make me great again and and uh and rather than there's no country really is looking at the global public goods so that's what China is now China has not backed on on on climate change agreement. China strongly support that and China has developed a very climate friendly environment now and we reach carbon neutral and carbon peak ahead of time.</p>
</details>

关于联合国等传统机构，王辉耀博士认为中国是现有联合国体系的坚定支持者。习主席最近提出的全球治理倡议中，强调了联合国宪章的原则和观点，并表示可以帮助加强、改进和完善现有体系，而不是重新开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But just to be clear, these legacy organizations specifically like the UN, does China feel like these are are there bets that China is intends to make that these are going to be important institutions or are they fading like many legacy institutions and that the sort of new more stable order that you may envision does it have to be with a fresh set of multilateral international organizations? No, I think China is a is a strong support of of existing UN system and as president she just recently proposed the global governance initiative. I mean on on five point two or three point he was emphasized the UN principle view and charter of UN and also uh we we can help to enhance improve and make it better but but we should not just restart or.</p>
</details>

然而，他也承认联合国正在被边缘化和削弱。例如，中国现在是联合国预算的第二大捐助国，与美国几乎没有区别。当美国退出**世界卫生组织**（WHO: World Health Organization: 联合国专门机构，致力于国际公共卫生）时，中国承诺向其捐款5亿美元。当**世界贸易组织**被边缘化时，中国与欧洲国家合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but but on the other hand we see UN also getting quite marginalized and there's been weakening and for example China becoming the second largest donor to the UN budget now close to US almost no difference now and also when US pulling out of the WHO China committed 500 million US dollars to WHO and when you know WTO is marginalized China is working with Europe Europeans to to do that.</p>
</details>

此外，中国仍然是唯一一个提出经济合作的大国，例如“一带一路倡议”在过去12、13年间投资超过1万亿美元，涉及3000个项目。中国还发起了中国-非洲、中国-拉丁美洲、中国-东盟、中国-中亚和中国-阿拉伯经济峰会，都与经济相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but furthermore I think China is still the only public big country one of the largest economy still proposing economic corporation like like a belton row initiative for the last 12 13 years China invest over$1 trillion US dollars for 3,000 project and also furthermore China has started the China Africa economic summit China Latin American economic summit, China Assan economic summit and China uh Central Asia and China Arab economic summit. So it's all economic related.</p>
</details>

与特朗普总统对100多个国家提高关税形成对比的是，中国宣布将对53个最不发达国家的产品实行零关税。王辉耀博士认为，中国正在提供足够的全球公共产品，以填补美国在**全球南方**（Global South: 指发展中国家和新兴经济体，通常位于南半球）发展和联合国体系方面的空白。例如，当美国退出**联合国教科文组织**（UNESCO: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization: 联合国专门机构，旨在通过教育、科学和文化促进国际合作）时，中国是其主要支持者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and furthermore and uh while President Trump is raising 100 some country tariff China announced they're going to going to reduce the tariff of 53 least developing country tariff zero for coming to China. So you can see the contrast there. So I think China is really providing enough public goods to fill some of vacuum. US is backing off on development on the global south and on on the on the UN system. You know, China is when US is pulling out the UNISO. China is also a big support of UNISO uh and and and so on and so forth. So, so I think China is doing a lot of that kind of activities. Now,</p>
</details>

### 中国民众对美国政策的担忧

主持人询问，中国民众对美国政策最大的误解或担忧是什么。王辉耀博士表示，最困扰普通中国民众的是美国海军经常出现在中国台湾海峡或南海，以及飞机在该地区巡逻。他指出，从未见过中国飞机或海军前往夏威夷或加勒比海。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when it comes to USChina relations, you know, you mentioned that your book was selling well in China. I'm really curious, what is the biggest misunderstanding or the biggest concern that you hear from Chinese people on the ground when it comes to US policy? And I realize it's a little bit unfair. We're treating you as a spokesman for an entire country. Um, and China, we really don't intend to do that. We don't intend to do that. But I'd be curious like what sort of questions do you get on a daily basis from the average Chinese person about America and what it's doing? Well, I think the biggest throwing point basically that bothers ordinary Chinese that we see the US uh you know navies coming to Chinese Tyran street or or South China Sea or quite often we see uh you know airplane patrol in this part of the world. We never see Chinese uh aircraft or navy go to Hawaii or go to Caribbean, you know, we never see that.</p>
</details>

他提到，美国在韩国部署了4万名军事人员，在日本也有3万至4万名，现在还在菲律宾部署，并计划在日本和韩国部署中程导弹。这些都令中国感到不安，因为中国认为台湾是中国的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we see the US military person is very strong. We had the 40,000 uh US military personnel in South Korea just just neighboring China and another I don't know how many you know it's quite 30 40,000 probably in Japan and we have now in Philippine and then they have also missiles mid range missiles placed there and also they are going to place new missiles in Japan now and and South Korea so those things are actually bought because because China felt you know Taiwan is part of China.</p>
</details>

王博士指出，美国人可能会说“中国是民主国家，我们必须捍卫它”，但中国有自己的“中国特色民主”和精英治理模式，这对世界上人口最多的国家来说运作良好。他认为，各国都有不同的治理模式，不能仅仅因为治理模式不同，就以保护台湾的民主为由进行干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh certainly the people in the USA oh China is a democra cy we have to defend that. But China has a has a Chinese style democracy, meritocracy. It also works perfect you know not perfect but at least work well for this most populous country in the world. So I think you know we all have a different uh governing style but just because our governing style is with you and then that's why you need to because Taiwan because the reason for protecting Taiwan is Taiwan is a democracy that we have to protect that.</p>
</details>

他强调，中国可以吸收台湾，并承诺给予台湾高度自治，不向中央政府纳税。中国还宣布台湾居民无需签证即可在大陆工作。目前已有200万台湾人在大陆工作，50万对夫妻两岸通婚。他认为，如果没有外国干预，两岸本已几乎融合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think you know China can also absorbing that and uh you know China promised to Taiwan you know no tax to be given uh to federal government lot of autonomy and China announced that Taiwan Taiwanese will be free to work in the ma mainland you no visa needed do anything needed. We are already 2 million Taiwanese working the mainland and there's half a million husband wife married across the street and then before Tai even uh you know former president of Taiwan you know there's 6 million mainland flooded Taiwan with with with tourism sending the money spending restaurant hotels you know there was almost integrated already if not for the foreign interference.</p>
</details>

王博士表示，中国人希望能够像东西德统一那样和平统一，也希望朝鲜和韩国能够统一。他们希望减少外部干预。中美三个联合公报明确规定，美国不与台湾保持官方关系。然而，美国官员、议员如南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）却不断访问台湾，或台湾领导人访问美国，这让普通中国人感到困扰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think the Chinese say okay please maybe just let us peacefully unified like like Germany you had the you know East Germany West Germany unified and and let's also hope North Korea South Korea unified so basically they would really looking for less interference on that and so I think that would be greatly improving the region because in the communicate that the established three communicate China US have it set very clear US will not maintain you We just maintain normal time, no official ties. But then we see US officials, parliament man, Nancy Pelosi keep visiting Taiwan or Taiwanese leaders coming to the visiting US. So those probably bother a bit of of ordinary Chinese.</p>
</details>

他承认美国长期以来扮演“世界警察”的角色，但现在许多国家的治理模式并非完美，美国和欧洲都面临国内问题。而中国似乎保持了良好的发展态势，并持续使人民脱贫。他认为，应该肯定中国的这些成就，而不是总是在中国家门口展示军事力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course again we understand of course US was was a world policeman for a long time but now we see many countries uh also the governing model is not working perfectly. We have all the domestic issues. uh US has it, European has it, all the countries has that. But China on the other hand seems uh maintain a pretty good uh status and that's also keep lifting people out of poverty. So I think they should give China some uh credit for doing that rather than okay uh is is always show in front of China's uh doorsteps and you have US parade of military muscles all the time. you. So that's a little bothering for the Chinese. basically</p>
</details>

### 加沙冲突后中国与全球南方的关系变化

主持人询问，自2023年10月加沙战争爆发以来，中国与**金砖国家**、非洲国家以及**全球南方**国家的关系是否发生了实质性变化。许多人认为美国是“世界警察”，而这场战争是否促使各国重新思考与中国的关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you think about China's relationship with the other BRICS countries uh with African countries with uh the global south countries so to speak have you seen substantive changes in those relationships specifically since the wake of October 2023 and the start of the war on Gaza and countries sort of rethinking uh you know has this prompted a concrete rethinking about you know you said the US was the global policeman and a lot of people have perceived that in the wake of this ongoing war. Has there been a substantive change in the way countries want to have a relationship with China?</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士表示，绝对如此。他指出，首次举行了中国-东盟-**海湾合作委员会**（GCC: Gulf Cooperation Council: 由波斯湾地区六个阿拉伯国家组成的政治经济联盟）峰会。**金砖国家**也在扩大，阿联酋和许多中东国家都与中国走得更近。最近还举行了**上海合作组织**峰会，土耳其和伊朗总统等该地区许多国家领导人出席。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, absolutely you can you know this series for the first time uh you see China ASEAN summit at the GCC you know Gulf countries all came to to ASEAN. So you you had the first China Assan GCC summit and then you can see also uh the BRICS countries expanding that uh you had you know uh UAE was there and and and uh there's a lot of you know Middle East countries are really uh coming to China. You have you also have the S Shanghai corporation summit recently. You had the Turkey, you had the Iranian president. You have a lot of people from that region.</p>
</details>

他认为，中国正在发挥作用。例如，几年前中国促成了沙特和伊朗之间的协议，而不是现在看到的混乱。中国还促成了巴勒斯坦14个不同派别在北京发表《巴勒斯坦宣言》。中国未来可以在促进以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的和平方面发挥更大作用，因为中国过去与以色列也保持着良好关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think China's role does play because China for example a few years ago China clinched the deal between Sawudis and and Iranians rather than you know we are seeing the current chaos going on. China also causing the 14 different factions of Palestinian group had a Beijing Palestinian decoration and China could probably do more in making a peace promoting peace between Israel and Palestinian. China also maintained good relation in the past with Israel.</p>
</details>

王博士认为，迟早这些国家会意识到不能任由加沙的人道主义危机、数万人的死亡持续下去。他强调，两个错误不能造就一个正确，应该继续发挥国际道德力量，**联合国安理会**应该真正行使其权力，而不是总是被否决。他相信中国未来可以发挥更大作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think that u sooner or later probably those country will realize that we cannot really let just what happened uh the Gaza the humanitarian crisis the you know deaths of thousands of tens of thousands of people uh what happened in your living room on a daily basis I mean where is where is the where's the you know children are dying and all those things so that kind of justice where is the justice now so of course there's there's there's always problem uh uh to start with but I think we cannot because two wrong doesn't make a right. I I really think that we should continue to have this international moral power that United Nations Security Council should really exercise rather than, you know, be vetoed all the time. So I I'm thinking, you know, China public could play more role in the future.</p>
</details>

他希望，如果**金砖国家**主导的维和行动能在乌克兰危机中成功，那么这种模式也可以应用于其他地区的冲突。中国也在努力，例如在中国的斡旋下，印度总理莫迪（Modi）和巴基斯坦总理在冲突后几个月内坐到同一张桌子旁。亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆总统也出席了在天津举行的**上海合作组织**峰会。因此，中国正在逐步建立其调解和维和能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's let's that's let's let's solve this Ukraine crisis if the if the BRICS country peacemaking can happen uh led by China. And I'm sure that model could be applied to other conflicts in other region. China also trying to you can see Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister of Pakistan was at the same table a few months after the fighting in China and we said Armenia and and Aabaijan president coming to SO summit in Tangent as well. So probably China is is is building up its mediating power and peacekeeping power as time goes on.</p>
</details>

### 中国对全球经济秩序“不公平”的看法

主持人再次回到全球化话题，指出中国是全球化的巨大受益者。然而，他感觉到中国内部仍有一种看法，认为全球经济秩序或贸易协议的某些方面对中国不公平。他问道，这种“不公平”的担忧源于何处？他承认美国官员也有类似的抱怨，尽管美国也是全球经济秩序的巨大受益者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just going back to globalization for a second. I think everyone agrees and you've already talked about this that China has been a huge beneficiary from globalization over time. But I get the sense that there is still a feeling within China that some aspects of the global economic order or trade agreements are unfair to China. How do you sort of square that tension and where do you think the concern or the worries over unfairness actually comes from? And by the way, I could ask this question to American officials as well. like the US is a massive beneficiary of the global economic order and yet the Trump administration clearly feels very aggrieved about America's place in the world but when it comes to China like where does the sense of unfairness actually come from</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士指出，一个主要问题是美国将贸易逆差视为发动关税战的唯一理由。他提到，几个月前他在联合国安理会的一次特别会议上发表演讲，指出美国只关注商品逆差，而其中30%至50%是由跨国公司生产的，30%是由美国公司生产的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well there's quite a few actually uh you see u one of the things that US was treating the pure deficit as the only reason they start the tariff war I was giving a talk just just last April two a few months ago at the UN security council where they called a special arena meeting in New York 80 countries represented the UN participated where I gave a speech there I was saying that for example US only looking at the goods deficit you know merchandise but out of that deficit was maybe you know 30 40 50% was produced by multinational 30% by US for example out of the 400 billion deficit that Trump is levy on China 300 some billion deficit He immediately waved 100 billion because a lot of the companies are made goods in China.</p>
</details>

例如，在特朗普对中国征收的4000亿美元关税中，他立即豁免了1000亿美元，因为许多公司在中国生产商品。苹果公司虽然试图将iPhone生产转移到印度，但仍不足以满足需求，因此不得不取消对这些商品的制裁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apple has to source their iPhone from India but it's not enough. Uh so they have to lift that sanctions on those deficit anyway and there's a lot of intertwin but also US enjoyed $1 trillion trade surplus on the service trade. They're not counting that and also the calculation about China's export.</p>
</details>

王博士还指出，美国在服务贸易方面享有1万亿美元的顺差，但这并未被计算在内。此外，在计算中国出口时，例如在中国制造的每部iPhone，中国可能只赚取劳务成本，80%的价值是由跨国公司创造的。电动汽车也是如此。因此，如果只看贸易逆差数字，很多利润并非在中国产生，而是由跨国公司获得，并且这些利润并未汇回美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, every every phone we made in China, iPhone made here, China probably made the labor cost. You know, 80% was made by multinationals EV cars the same. So when you just purely looking at the trade deficit numbers, a lot of money was not made in China, was made by international multinational companies and they're not sending back to the country.</p>
</details>

他同意特朗普总统的观点，即应该有更多投资回流美国，因为跨国公司在中国和其他地方赚取了大量资金，但这些资金应该回流投资，而不是流入避税天堂。这就是**经济合作与发展组织**（OECD: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: 旨在促进成员国经济和社会福祉的国际组织）提出的全球最低税率已获得100多个国家同意，但尚未实施的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's why I I agree with President Trump to have more investment back to us because multinational made a lot of money in China and elsewhere. But they should really uh investment back uh rather than put into tax heavens. So that's why the global minimum tax proposed by OECD has agreed by over 100 some countries but it's not practiced yet on that now. So that's one aspect.</p>
</details>

另一个方面是美国对中国的制裁，例如禁止向中国出售芯片。特朗普政府曾提出“高墙小院”政策，将1500家中国公司列入美国**实体清单**（Entity List: 美国商务部限制特定公司获取美国技术的名单）。王博士认为，与中国将少数美国公司列入清单相比，美国过度使用安全理由限制所有中国公司，这成为了一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other aspect I could say is the for example US is starting these sanctions on China for example forbidden the use selling the trips to China. So that that is really an also they called in the Trump administration you know high fence small yard and all those thing and there's 1,500 Chinese companies on the US entity the list I mean maybe China has a a dozen or two dozen of US company but compared with magnitude of of US is too much too many over the sec overuse of the security raises to really restrict all the Chinese companies on that so that really become a problem and.</p>
</details>

因此，中国开始反击，例如当芯片被视为军民两用产品时，稀土也同样如此。当中国开始在这方面采取行动时，美国便开始放松对芯片销售的限制。王博士认为，如果美国在第一个任期采取行动时中国没有回应，现在中国开始回应，这导致了中美官员之间达成了一些协议。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So that's why China starting to say okay if chips can be the do use goods right you can say okay can be used for security or military same is true for rare earth right rare earth can be making for airplanes tank tanks everything so when China start a little bit on that then US starting to relax on the sale of the chips now uh quite a bit so you can see uh you know morally u it's the same reason if US doing things in the first term China didn't respond like that but now China starting to respond like that. So I think that's why we see quite a few agreement made by between US and Chinese officials because China is much resilient now much stronger and also US has realized if they really sanction so hard on China the Christmas shopping season we're coming up their shelves will be empty and we could you know American consumer will suffer and then that going to hurt Trump's base uh that's why they keep extending uh they seems more uh they talk to each other more more friendly than talk to Indian Brazil and others So I think they they probably realize they're two largest economy. They can really organize each other. They have to find a way to collaborate.</p>
</details>

他认为，中国现在更具韧性，也更强大。美国也意识到，如果对中国施加过于严厉的制裁，即将到来的圣诞购物季货架将空空如也，美国消费者将受苦，这会损害特朗普的支持基础。因此，两国似乎更愿意相互沟通，并意识到作为两大经济体，必须找到合作的方式。

### 全球供应链多元化与中国产业升级

主持人提到彭博社的一篇报道称，北京官员口头鼓励监管机构和地方政府限制向印度和东南亚的技术转让和设备出口。例如，富士康（Foxconn）工程师可能参与了将苹果iPhone供应链（最终组装）转移到印度，而中国官员可能对此表示反对。主持人问道，中国是否完全接受全球化进程中部分制造业可能外流，或者美国寻求供应链多元化？

<details>

<p class="english-text">The uh the Christmas shopping season is my personal Super Bowl. Yes. Earlier this year, actually not that long ago, Bloomberg reported, so therefore it's absolutely true. Uh it says, quote, "Officials in Beijing verbally encouraged regulatory agencies and local governments to curb technology transfers and equipment exports to India and Southeast Asia." And there were some stories about Foxcon engineers for example who may have been part of some sort of moving the supply chain of those Apple uh iPhones that you meant part of the final assembly perhaps to India and this report that uh Chinese officials may have been pushing back against it. I get like rhetorically the existing system where American companies do a lot of manufacturing or in China has been incredibly beneficial. Is China totally comfortable with the fact that as part of this globalization some of this manufacturing may end up leaving or is uh you know US seeks to diversify its sources is China comfortable with this</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士表示，中国现在对此相当适应，也更加自信。例如，在疫情爆发前的2019年，美国是中国最大的贸易伙伴，但现在已降至第三或第四位，因为**东盟**（ASEAN: Association of Southeast Asian Nations: 东南亚国家联盟）已成为中国最大的贸易伙伴，这得益于**区域全面经济伙伴关系协定**（RCEP: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership: 旨在降低关税、开放服务贸易、促进投资的区域自由贸易协定）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China's I think it's pretty comfortable now that's why China is more confident for example 2019 when before co US is largest trading partner of China and now US fall into the third place or even fourth place now because ASA become the largest place trading part of China since the asset uh regional comprehensive partnership agreement and then that that is actually happening because uh you know Vietnam become China fourth largest trading partner now and Indonesia, Malaysia and now expanded to Latin American you know most Latin American countries China is their largest trading partner and also with Africa now China lifted all the tariff from African countries products coming to China you see a flood of African products coming to China.</p>
</details>

越南已成为中国第四大贸易伙伴，印度尼西亚、马来西亚以及大多数拉丁美洲国家和非洲国家也以中国为最大贸易伙伴。中国已取消了对非洲国家产品进入中国的所有关税，非洲产品大量涌入中国。

<p class="english-text">So so I think you know that probably China doesn't mind there's the low maybe a little bit labor intensive because the labor average labor workforce migrant workers age is 43 years old it's getting old China so there's a lot of shoe making or you know low low income labor cost jobs went to Vietnam went to Asia China really uh doesn't mind that China now is focused on the high end now for example China is focused on the green power transmission car.</p>
</details>

王博士认为，中国可能不介意一些劳动密集型产业外流，因为中国农民工的平均年龄已达43岁，劳动力正在老龄化。许多制鞋业或低收入劳务成本的工作已转移到越南和亚洲其他国家。中国现在专注于高端产业，例如绿色能源汽车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's no curbs like there's no curbs as far There's like from your perspective there's no impulse of the government to curb moving some of these more advanced things again talk about iPhones and such to a country like India. Not really. I I think China still you encouraged the investment for example BYD or uh you know CL and I I know quite a few companies still very bullish investing overseas. There may be sensitive military or rare earth stuff that China may be question a little bit but but on the general I think things are still quite open. Yeah.</p>
</details>

他表示，从他的角度看，政府没有阻止将iPhone等更先进的制造转移到印度等国家的冲动。中国仍然鼓励海外投资，例如比亚迪（BYD）和宁德时代（CATL）等公司对海外投资仍非常看好。虽然可能对敏感的军事或稀土产品有所疑问，但总体而言，中国仍然相当开放。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there an argument to be made that China should perhaps open its own economy further if you know it actually desires more economic integration with the rest of the world because we're talking about globalization still but China still has capital controls still has currency controls still has some restrictions on investment and things like that should it be more open</p>
</details>

### 中国经济的进一步开放与改革

主持人问道，如果中国希望与世界其他地区实现更深层次的经济融合，是否应该进一步开放其经济，因为中国仍然存在资本管制、货币管制以及对投资的一些限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely I I agree with you I think China should be more open and that's why we be that's our think tank role to promote that. For example, we propose be promoting the the visa. Now, China has issued the unilaterally issued the visa for 40ome countries, now European countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea. I I urge also you recommend China to policy makers to open visa for US citizens, for Canadian citizens coming to China free.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士完全同意，并表示这也是他们智库的职责所在。例如，他们提倡签证便利化。中国已对40多个国家（包括欧洲国家、澳大利亚、日本、韩国）实行单方面免签。他呼吁中国政策制定者也对美国和加拿大公民实行免签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But also on the trade policy, I think there there should be more liberalization continuously. I know that the government is looking at that and the 15th five years plan will probably be even more open. Of course, there's always rooms to improve. I totally agree. And uh uh they have opened the financial sector quite a long time ago. And uh as you say maybe currency they should be more convertible and also on the on the investment in the culture in the in the in the you know other areas uh pharmaceutical and and now China also welcome foreign university come to China to open their branches and doing I'm I'm on the board of Duke Kensangan University in China which is John Van between Duke University and Wuhan University. uh you know we have so many international student there and NYU Shanghai is operating very well so we hope to have more global uh exchanges I agree with you you know there there there's still more rooms that's why I think this kind of talk between China and the US now we see Tik Tok is almost maybe have a deal there and it's great so we we this is the style we should continuously talk and engage and reach agreement and open up further uh to accommodate each other</p>
</details>

在贸易政策方面，他认为应该持续推进自由化。他知道政府正在考虑这一点，第十五个五年规划可能会更加开放。当然，总有改进的空间。他完全同意。金融业早已开放，货币也应该更具可兑换性。在文化、制药等其他领域的投资也应更加开放。中国现在也欢迎外国大学来华设立分校。他本人是**杜克昆山大学**（Duke Kunshan University: 由美国杜克大学和中国武汉大学合作创办的中外合作大学）的董事会成员，该校有许多国际学生，上海纽约大学也运营良好。他希望有更多的全球交流。他认为，中美之间应该继续对话、接触并达成协议，进一步开放以适应彼此。

### 美国对制造业空心化与国家安全的担忧

主持人乔·魏森塔尔指出，中国工业部门的蓬勃发展使其变得更加富裕，美国也受益于购买更便宜、更复杂的商品。然而，美国存在一种担忧，即如果没有强大的制造业能力，美国将无法成为一个强大的军事国家。他问道，从王辉耀博士的角度来看，美国的这种担忧是否有道理？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">first comes diplomacy through dance videos, Joe. And then comes an easing of uh currency restrictions. Well, podcast recordings have to be right. And just to be clear, you know, obviously we don't expect you to be the representative of the entire Chinese perspective. Tracy and I need to establish that we do not represent the entire United States and the questions that we have. You mentioned the goods trade deficit and of course one of the things is you know obviously China has gotten much richer thanks to the booming industrial sector. The US has benefited from a lot of less expensive, more sophisticated goods that it buys. But there is this source of concern, and I say this, you know, a couple weeks after that military parade, there is a source of concern that without a robust American manufacturing capacity, that we can no longer be a powerful military country as well. And I know I do not believe it is China's role to sort of help the US figure out its industrial capacity questions. Nonetheless, from the perspective, does the US concern make sense to you? Perhaps there are things that seem unfair, certain technology transfer restrictions seem counter to the spirit of globalization, etc. But is the US fundamentally wrong to be concerned that as more and more of the world's share, however you want to measure it, of manufacturing of advanced goods somehow becomes centered around China that that long-term weakens the national security position of the United States.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士认为，世界现在更加紧密相连，存在许多竞争优势，正如**大卫·李嘉图**（David Ricardo: 英国古典经济学家，以其比较优势理论闻名）多年前所说。他认为美国仍然处于领先地位，擅长创新。硅谷和人工智能就是例证。他指出，一半的**人工智能**人才来自中国，美国也是中国人才的巨大受益者。数百万中国人前往美国，其中一半可能返回，但仍有许多人留在美国，极大地促进了美国经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I I think we are now in a more intertwined war now and there's lot there's quite a bit of a competitive advantage like you know David Victo mentioned many years ago. So what I think US is still leading US is very good at uh uh inventing innovation. You see Silicon Valley, you see AI, you know, by the way uh Jason Hong said half of the AI talents coming from China. You know, US is a big harvest of Chinese talent too. And uh that's why I'm saying several million Chinese went to United States. I mean probably half of them return uh still have remain. uh that greatly benefit the US economy.</p>
</details>

他认为，美国擅长从“零到一”的创新，而中国擅长从“一到一百”的规模化。全球百强大学中，前50名仍在美国。中国之所以能进行如此多的制造业，是因为它拥有基础设施，例如全球70%的高速铁路、60%的5G网络，以及全球十大集装箱港口中的七个。这是一个全球的价值链和供应链，而非仅仅为中国服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what I think that that is really US is good doing zero to one maybe China is good at one to 100. So out of the world 100 university top 50 still in the United States. The reason China did all those manufacturing because as I mentioned China has 70% of the global speed railway 60% of global 5G networks 10 largest container port seven of in they have the infrastructure to do that. So this is a value chain supply chain for the world not for China. So made in China is made for the world.</p>
</details>

他认为，美国只是担心如果他们不能制造大型船舶或飞机，现在他们会去韩国制造。他认为美国不必完全依赖制造业。在贸易战之前，中国从美国购买大量芯片，中国70%的能源依赖进口，购买芯片的钱甚至超过进口能源。现在美国不卖给中国，美国公司失去了巨大的利润中心，减少了**研发**（R&D: Research and Development: 研究与开发）预算，而中国被迫进行再创新，这造成了巨大的浪费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think US only worry about if they can make you cannot make a big ships or or aircraft. Now they go to South Korea to do that now. Right. So they they still find a way to do that. But I don't think that you you have to depend totally on the manufacturing. So if if if if we are living in the pre uh uh you know trade war era you know where we we buy so much chips from US China 70% of China energy depends on import China spend more money buying the chips than China importing energy so now you say they're not selling to China then the US company losing the big profit uh center and then they they really reduce their R&D budget and China is forced to do reinvent well and there's a lot of waste there.</p>
</details>

王博士认为，这种分离对安全原因没有任何好处。不应该过度安全化，而应该发挥各自的竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we see this uh uh separation is really no good all on security reasons. We should not overseerize and we should really display our own each other's competitive advantage.</p>
</details>

### 中国在冲突中扮演更积极外交角色的可能性

主持人询问，在未来的全球秩序中，中国是否会采取更强硬的外交手段，例如在冲突中停止贸易或停止出售先进技术，就像美国对俄罗斯实施制裁一样。他指出，尽管中国对加沙战争表示担忧，但目前其贸易关系并未改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to ask one more question about security philosophy. Obviously when Russia invaded Ukraine, the US imposed all kinds of sanctions on Russia and tried to constrain its ability to trade at all or make any money. going back to Israel's war in Gaza and you expressed the horror that you see from that and the sort of response to that. But China still trades with Israel as the US does in the future in a sort of different uh global world order. Would it ever be part of China's diplomatic arsenal to take a more heavy hand in some of these conflicts and say, "Oh, we're not going to trade you. We're not going to sell you advanced technology that you need to run your economy or run your military." etc. Because so far, despite the sort of concerns or the the response, there hasn't been any change in the trading relationship. Could it ever get to that point where China views its sort of diplomatic commercial power that way in conflicts that it's not directly involved in?</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士认为，中国当然希望做得更多，就像在**世界卫生组织**（WHO）问题上履行了义务一样。他认为关键在于恢复联合国的权威和原则，特别是**联合国安理会**。他建议改革安理会，例如增加**二十国集团**（G20: Group of Twenty: 由世界主要经济体组成的国际经济合作论坛）的其他16个成员作为联合国准常任理事国，并且不应滥用单边否决权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think China certainly would like to do more, you know, like what happening on the WHO, China's already fulfilled its obligations, too. I I think the key is really we need to restore the UN uh authority and principle uh particularly the UN security council. Maybe we should also reform that too. Maybe we should add G20 uh members other 16 G20 members as associate permanent member of UN and and we should really not let the unilateral single veto be abused.</p>
</details>

他指出，自联合国成立以来，俄罗斯滥用否决权100多次，美国100多次，中国20次。他认为需要控制这种滥用。他主张改革联合国以反映多极世界，未来如果发生任何问题，应派遣联合国维和部队。如果安理会和大会有绝大多数成员同意，就可以实现。他认为，改革联合国以适应多极世界是必要的，因为现有结构已不符合当今现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh for for example since the founding of UN Russia over abused the use the VA 100 sometimes 20 40 times US 100 times China 20 times we we we need to really control that so I think we reform UN to reflect this multipolar world and in the future if there any other there's any problem happen let's send the UN peacekeeping force to do that and so if the all the security member have a big majority and general assembly have a big majority we make that happen. So I think reform this multipolar world we also need to reform you to reflect that because uh the world is no longer fits the the superructure does not fit the reality today now.</p>
</details>

### 播客总结与展望

主持人乔·魏森塔尔和特雷西·阿洛韦感谢王辉耀博士的精彩分享，并再次提出希望能在北京进行一次现场播客录制。王博士表示欢迎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Uh Henry Wong founder and president uh for center for China and globalization. So fantastic to have you on the show. Can we do a live odd lots in Beijing with you at some point? Yeah. Yeah, please. We welcome that. All right. We are going to as soon as as soon as we get off this call, we are going to begin the preparations to figure out how we're going to make this happen. So great chatting you with you. Thank you for staying up late uh in your time to talk with us and hope to talk to you again soon. Thank you. Thank you so much both of you. Thank you so much.</p>
</details>

特雷西·阿洛韦表示，这次对话让她印象深刻的是中国政策的经济导向性。她认为这与**中国共产党**（CCP: Chinese Communist Party: 中华人民共和国的执政党）的“社会契约”理念有关，即只要人民生活改善，**中国共产党**就能获得强力支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I really enjoyed that conversation. It was interesting thinking about, you know, this idea that rhetorically there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who say things like, "Oh, we need to get out of this sort of competition framework, etc." It doesn't really feel like anything is actually happening on that front. Yes. One thing that struck me from the conversation was I guess how um economically oriented it feels like all of Chinese policy actually is. And I suppose maybe that gets back to this idea, this is an old idea now, but that social contract idea about the CCP. So as long as people feel that their lives are getting better, then the CCP has strong support. I think the economic focus really came through in that conversation.</p>
</details>

乔·魏森塔尔补充说，从美国视角来看，许多人认为美国海军扮演着“全球警察”的角色，确保世界贸易自由，这是一种全球公共产品。**亚当·波森**（Adam Posen: 美国经济学家，彼得森国际经济研究所所长）等人也曾讨论过经济与军事力量的这种紧密关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you know obviously in from the US perspective there is this view that you know Henry used the word global policeman and a lot of people would say yes absolutely and that a big role of the US Navy specifically is enforcing the fact or freeing the world for trade right that part of the reason that the world can trade freely that that's like a public good providing a public good and Adam Posen has talked about this and Others have talked about this idea that these things go hand in hand.</p>
</details>

他指出，王辉耀博士谈到了继续全球贸易的愿望，但中国似乎没有明显的意愿或能力来填补美国可能留下的“肌肉”空白。他提出一个有趣的问题：世界贸易是否需要如此强大的军事力量？一个没有单一实体拥有真正全球军事足迹的世界能否实现自由贸易？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's interesting because so Henry talked about this impulse for continuation of global trade including with the US etc. There clearly to my mind seems to be less of an appetite from China to like or it's not obvious that there is a to fill the gap. Yeah. Or that you know and I guess there's question like does the world need such muscle to trade, right? Does could you have a world of trade where there is not one entity that has a truly global military footprint? I think these are really interesting questions.</p>
</details>

王辉耀博士在最后提到了加强和改革联合国。乔·魏森塔尔对此表示，这些现有机构即使有大量中国资金注入，也未必能真正复兴。特雷西·阿洛韦则质疑，即使安理会改革，联合国又能真正做些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Henry of course talked about, especially in that last answer, restrengthening the UN, etc. restructuring restructuring the UN. Exactly. It's not entirely obvious to me that these institutions as they're constructed can really be revived even with um lots of Chinese money going into them. I think that's still kind of TBD. Well, I think this is it, right? Even if you restructured the security council so that you know you wouldn't have one powerful member um vetoing stuff all the time. Even if people agreed to do things, what is the UN actually going to do? Right.</p>
</details>

乔·魏森塔尔认为，许多美国人可能会乐见由**金砖国家**组成的维和部队，希望在俄乌战争中实现停火，并且不希望由西方维和人员承担主要负担。他认为这是一个非常有用的中国视角综述。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. What is the UN actually going to do? I don't know. We didn't get into it that much, but like the idea of a sort of more I don't know bricks composed peacekeeping force. I bet there are a lot of people in the US who would love that. They're like, "Yeah, let's have peace. Let's have a ceasefire. Someone else take care of let's have a ceasefire in Russia and Ukraine and also let's not have it be particularly dominated by Western peacekeepers shouldering that burden. I bet a lot of people in the US would love that. I would, you know, had with more time. I would love to really explore like what the constraints on that actually happening are there. But I thought that was a uh a very useful sort of overview of some of these questions from the Chinese perspective. Absolutely. Don't explore the constraints, Joe. Just take credit for solving US China tensions on the podcast. Okay. In less than an hour. Um shall we leave it there? Let's leave it there.</p>
</details>

播客最后，主持人感谢听众，并鼓励大家在喜欢的播客平台留下好评，以支持他们前往北京进行更多现场采访。
