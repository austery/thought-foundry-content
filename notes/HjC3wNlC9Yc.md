### 特朗普威胁动用《叛乱法案》

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是《新闻头条》。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 1 月 16 日，星期五。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, January 16th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Reporter**: 特朗普总统今天在 **True Socialism** 上威胁要动用《**叛乱法案**》。我想知道他的底线是什么，比如，什么会让他动用《叛乱法案》？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: President Trump threatened invoking the Insurrection Act today in True Socialism. I'm wondering what his tipping point is, like what would it take for him to invoke the Insurrection Act?

</details>

**Reporter**: 坦白说，这只能由总统本人来回答。但《叛乱法案》是总统可以动用的一个工具。如你所知，它被谨慎地使用过，但美国历史上曾有前总统使用过它。特朗普总统在社交媒体上发帖威胁要动用《叛乱法案》来回应明尼苏达州的抗议活动，这引发了一系列问题：他能这样做吗？他会这样做吗？这样做意味着什么？该法案在某些条件下赋予总统广泛的权力，可以派军队进入美国城市。我会说，如果我觉得动用《叛乱法案》很重要，我有权这样做，那又是另一回事了，因为那样我几乎可以做任何我想做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Look, that's only a question, frankly, the president can answer. But the Insurrection Act is a tool at the president's disposal. As you know, it has been used uh sparingly, but it has been used uh by previous presidents in American history. President Trump's social media post threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests in Minnesota has set off a flurry of questions of can he, will he, and what would it mean? The act gives the president broad authority under some conditions to send troops into US cities. I will say if I feel it's important to uh invoke the insurrection act, which I have the right to do, that's a different thing because then I have the right to do pretty much what I want to do. But

</details>

**Reporter**: 特朗普总统在本届任期内多次提起此事，包括上周在椭圆形办公室接受《泰晤士报》记者采访时。这一次，白宫将其定性为对民主党人的警告，此前该政府指责民主党人煽动抗议活动。自 1992 年以来，美国总统就未曾动用过《叛乱法案》。当年，在几名白人警官因殴打一名手无寸铁的黑人男子 **Rodney King** 而被判无罪后，洛杉矶爆发了骚乱，军队被部署到洛杉矶。过去一周，自一名 **ICE agent** 枪杀 **Renee Good** 以来，明尼阿波利斯已有数千人在街头抗议此次枪击事件以及当地移民执法部门正在进行的移民镇压行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: President Trump has brought it up multiple times this term, including just last week in the Oval Office in an interview with Times reporters. This time, the White House is framing it as a warning to Democrats who the administration has accused of egging on the protests. The Insurrection Act hasn't been invoked by a US president since 1992 when troops were deployed in LA in response to riots that broke out after several white police officers were acquitted in the beating of an unarmed black man, Rodney King. In the last week, since an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, thousands of people have been out in the streets in Minneapolis protesting the killing and the immigration crackdown agents are carrying out there.

</details>

**Reporter**: 待在联邦财产之外，否则你将被逮捕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Stay off federal property or you will be arrested.

</details>

**Reporter**: 有时，抗议者与联邦特工发生冲突。目前约有 3000 名联邦特工被部署在那里。地方和州官员表示，这种部署正在制造不安全状况，特工们推搡民众、砸毁汽车车窗并将司机从车里拖出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: At times, protesters have clashed with federal agents. There are now about 3,000 of them deployed there. Local and state officials have said that deployment is creating an unsafe situation with agents shoving people, smashing car windows, and pulling drivers out of their vehicles.

</details>

**Reporter**: 有计划撤出明尼苏达州吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Any plans to pull out of Minnesota?

</details>

**Reporter**: 没有计划撤出明尼苏达州。当被问及局势和特朗普威胁使用《叛乱法案》时，**国土安全部部长 Christy Gnome** 表示他们一直在讨论此事，但她说最终将由特朗普决定下一步行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: No plans to pull out of Minnesota. When asked about the situation and Trump's threat to use the insurrection act, Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome said they had been talking about it, but she said it would be up to Trump to decide what's next.

</details>

**Reporter**: 哦，我认为总统未来有这个机会。呃，这是他的宪法权利，是否要使用它由他决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Oh, I think that the president has that opportunity in the future. Uh, it's his constitutional right and it's up to him if he wants to utilize it.

</details>

**Reporter**: 很可能会这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Likely to do it.

</details>

**Reporter**: 我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: I don't know.

</details>

### 移民政策争议与法律挑战

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于政府移民镇压行动还有两个其他进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two other developments on the administration's immigration crackdown.

</details>

**Reporter**: 波士顿的一名联邦法官就政府试图驱逐抗议以色列的大学生一事，再次对该政府提出谴责。里根任命的法官 **William Young** 称 **总统特朗普** 为“**威权主义者**”，并表示该政府在试图驱逐抗议 **Gaza** 战争的国际学生时侵犯了**言论自由保护**。该政府声称，根据一项模糊的法律条款，他们有权这样做，声称这些学生威胁到美国的**外交政策**。但在昨天的庭审中，法官表示，驱逐威胁是为了“**歪曲法律，挑选知名活动人士**”以恐吓他人。法官表示，下周他计划发布一项最终命令，限制政府驱逐提起诉讼的两个学术团体的成员。他还表示，今后政府必须证明任何驱逐都不是报复行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: A federal judge in Boston issued a new rebuke to the administration over its efforts to deport college students who demonstrated against Israel. Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, called President Trump an authoritarian and said the administration had violated free speech protections when it tried to deport international students who'd been protesting over the war in Gaza. The administration said it had the authority to do so under an obscure legal provision, claiming the students were a threat to American foreign policy. But in court yesterday, the judge said the deportation threats were an effort to quote twist the laws and pick off prominent activists to intimidate others. The judge said that next week he plans to issue a final order restricting the administration from deporting members of two academic groups that brought the case. And he said that going forward the government will have to show that any deportations are not retaliation.

</details>

**Reporter**: 那么，你对这个令人震惊的承认有何反应？我接受他们的道歉，我希望基于这次道歉，我能够回到我的学业，也能和我的父母在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: what's your reaction to that stunning admission? I accept their apologies and I hope that based on this apology I'm able to return back to my studies and also to um be home with my parents.

</details>

**Reporter**: 特朗普政府罕见地承认了一项错误。它表示，在驱逐一名试图在感恩节回家过节的大学生时犯了一个错误。19岁的 **Ani Lopez Bologa**，七岁时从洪都拉斯来到美国，她在前往德克萨斯州探望家人的途中，在波士顿机场被移民特工拘留。第二天，一名法官签署了一项命令，称在她案件 pending 期间不得将她驱逐出美国。但在此之后的一天，她被送上了飞往洪都拉斯的航班，这是该政府多次无视法庭命令并继续进行驱逐的又一例。本周在法庭上，一名法官表示，他将努力寻找一个解决方案，让她能够返回美国并重返学校，尽管政府尚未撤销对她的指控。自从她被驱逐以来，她的家人一直受到移民当局的恐吓。她的父母表示，上个月，特工们驾驶三辆没有标记的汽车出现在他们位于德克萨斯州的家外面。一名特工冲向她的父亲，但他逃回家并锁上了门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: The Trump administration has made a rare admission. It said it made a mistake when it deported a college student who was trying to fly home for Thanksgiving. 19-year-old Ani Lopez Bologa, who was brought from Honduras to the US when she was seven, was on her way to visit family in Texas when immigration agents detained her at the airport in Boston. The next day, a judge signed an order saying she could not be removed from the US while her case was pending. But the day after that, she was put on a flight to Honduras, one of multiple times that the administration has ignored court orders and pushed forward with deportations. In court this week, a judge said he would try and find a solution so that she can return to the US and get back to school, though the government hasn't dropped its case against her. Since she was deported, her family has faced intimidation from immigration authorities. Her parents said that last month, agents appeared outside their home in Texas in three unmarked cars. One agent rushed at her father, but he fled into the house and locked the door.

### 诺贝尔奖章赠予与政治姿态

**Reporter**: 昨天在白宫，我向美利坚合众国总统赠送了**诺贝尔和平奖**奖章。委内瑞拉反对派领导人、2025年诺贝尔和平奖得主 **Maria Karino Machado** 将她的奖章赠予了特朗普总统。自从特朗普总统赶走 **Nicholas Maduro** 后，她一直在试图讨好他，但他并未支持她领导委内瑞拉的努力，称她是一位非常好的女士，但她没有成为总统所需的尊重。目前尚不清楚她昨天与特朗普会面是否获得了任何东西。会后，白宫在社交媒体上发布了一张特朗普举着一个装饰精美的奖牌的照片，中间是金色的奖章，并刻有文字，表彰他“为确保一个自由的委内瑞拉所采取的原则性和决定性行动”。Machado 这一极不寻常的举动发生之际，特朗普已花费数月时间声称他本应赢得该奖项。在最近的一份声明中，**诺贝尔学会**明确表示，该奖项并非如此运作，并澄清说，它不能被分享、转让或撤销，并表示其决定是“最终的，并永远有效”。尽管如此，过去也有几枚诺贝尔奖章被出售，这些奖章是 18 克拉金的。几年前，帮助发现 DNA 结构的 **James Watson** 以超过 400 万美元的价格出售了他的奖章。最近，一位获得和平奖的俄罗斯记者将奖章拍卖了超过 1 亿美元，为乌克兰儿童难民筹集资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: At the White House yesterday, I presented the President of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize. Maria Karino Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, gave her award to President Trump. She's been trying to curry favor with him since he ousted Nicholas Maduro, but he has not backed her efforts to lead Venezuela, saying she's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect needed to be president. It's not immediately clear what, if anything, she got out of her meeting with Trump yesterday. Afterward, the White House posted an image on social media showing Trump holding up an ornate framed plaque with the gold prize in the middle of it, and an inscription recognizing his quote principled and decisive action to secure a free Venezuela. Machado's highly unusual gesture came after Trump has spent months saying that he should have won the award. In a recent statement, the Nobel Institute made clear that the award does not work like that, clarifying that it can't be shared, transferred, or revoked, saying that its decision is quote final and stands for all time. Despite that, a few Nobel prizes, which are 18 karat gold, have been sold in the past. A few years ago, James Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, sold his for over $4 million. And more recently, a Russian journalist who won the Peace Prize auctioned the award off for over $100 million to raise money for Ukrainian child refugees.

</details>

### 经济事实核查：物价上涨

**Reporter**: 最后，关于特朗普政府的最新消息，快速事实核查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: And last update on the Trump administration, a quick fact check.

</details>

**Reporter**: 我们的经济令人难以置信，我正在降低物价。请记住这一点，高物价不是我造成的。最近，**可负担性**已成为美国政治的热门话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Our economy is unbelievable and I'm bringing down the prices. Remember this, I didn't cause the high prices. recently as affordability has become the topic in American politics.

</details>

**Reporter**: **食品价格**正开始迅速下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Grocery prices are starting to go rapidly down.

</details>

**Reporter**: 特朗普总统一再声称，在他的政府执政下，食品价格正在下跌，但新的政府数据显示，价格实际上在上涨。总体而言，在过去 12 个月里，食品价格上涨了 2% 以上。对于某些食品，这个数字要高得多。**咖啡**价格上涨了近 20%，**牛肉**价格上个月飙升至新高。价格上涨的原因多种多样，如燃料成本、极端天气以及特朗普的一些政策。例如，**关税**推高了罐头食品铝材的成本，这可能是一个促成因素。此外，该政府的移民镇压行动导致一些农场难以找到工人。虽然一些产品的价格有所下降，特别是鸡蛋和牛奶，但消费者仍然感到压力。特别是低收入美国人正在转向购买更便宜的产品并减少购买量。据食品杂货行业高管称，他们开始在**中产阶级消费者**中也看到同样的现象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: President Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices are falling under his administration, but new government data shows that prices are actually rising. Overall, in the past 12 months, grocery prices went up more than 2%. For certain foods, that number is way higher. Coffee is up almost 20% and ground beef prices surged to a new record high last month. There are a wide range of reasons for the uptick like fuel costs and extreme weather and some of Trump's own policies. Tariffs have driven up the cost of aluminum for canned goods, for example, which could be contributing. Plus, the administration's immigration crackdown has left some farms struggling to find workers. And while the prices of some products have come down, notably eggs and milk, shoppers are still being squeezed. Low-income Americans in particular are trading down to cheaper products and buying less. According to grocery executives, they say they're starting to see the same behavior in middle class consumers, too.

### Gmail 集成 AI 与隐私考量

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，如果你像全球超过十亿用户一样使用 **Gmail**，你可能已经看到 **AI** 出现在该平台上。也许它会为你提供一些回复建议，这样你就不用打字说“谢谢，你也是”。现在，**Google** 正在推出更多 AI 工具，有些是免费的，有些不是，它声称这些工具可以帮助人们管理他们压倒性的收件箱。例如，你现在可以通过输入一个问题来查找电子邮件，比如“我上个月谈过的那个招聘人员的名字是什么？”当然，为了让新功能正常工作，Google 的 AI 助手 **Gemini** 需要访问用户的整个收件箱。这引发了关于新工具是否值得牺牲潜在隐私的疑问。《纽约时报》科技记者 **Brian Chen** 测试了 Google 的新 Gmail 一周。它根据他的电子邮件自动生成了一个待办事项列表：联系儿科医生，填写学前班注册表，他觉得这非常有用。他并不喜欢那些旨在帮助加快回复电子邮件速度的工具。他交谈过的一位隐私和安全专家表示，AI 的推出应该提醒人们，你的电子邮件中没有任何东西是 100% 私密的。Google 或你使用的任何平台都可以访问它。执法部门也可以通过传票访问。所以，你越开始依赖它，与它聊天，告诉它你的生活和计划，它就能访问越多。需要注意的是，Brian 测试的许多 AI 功能对 Gmail 用户来说都是默认开启的，或者将是默认开启的。但是，可以通过进入你的账户设置来选择退出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, if you use Gmail like a billion plus people worldwide do, you've likely seen AI showing up on the platform. Maybe it's offered to write some replies for you so you don't have to type out, "Thanks. That sounds great yourself." Now, Google is rolling out even more AI tools, some free, some not, that it says can help people manage their overwhelming inboxes. For example, you can now find an email by typing a question like, "What's the name of the job recruiter I talked to last month." But of course, to make the new features work, Google's AI assistant, Gemini, needs access to a user's entire inbox. And that has raised questions about whether the new tools are worth the potential tradeoff in privacy. Times tech writer Brian Chen tested out Google's new Gmail for a week. It automatically generated a to-do list for him based on his emails. Get back to the pediatrician. Fill out that preschool enrollment, which he found very useful. He didn't love the tools intended to help speed up writing email replies. One privacy and security expert he talked with said the AI rollout should be a reminder to people that nothing in your email is 100% private. Google or whatever platform you use has access to it. So does law enforcement with a subpoena. So, the more you start relying on it, chatting with it, telling it about your life and your plans, the more it has access to. One thing to note, a lot of the AI features Brian tried out are or will be turned on for Gmail users by default. But there is a way to opt out by going into your account settings.

Original theme by Dan Powell. Special thanks to Isabella Anderson, Lissa Anderson, Zoe Murphy, and Paula Schuman.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，是时候进行问答了。我们准备了几个关于《泰晤士报》报道的故事的问题。看看你掌握了多少。第一个问题。根据本周总统签署的一项新法律，有一件食品很快将重返美国各地学校的食堂。你的问题是，什么食品或饮料不再被禁止在联邦资助的学校营养计划中？如果你正在绞尽脑汁，这个老式广告可能会有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, time for the quiz. We've got a few questions for you about stories the Times has been covering. Let's see what you got. First question. Under a new law, which was signed by the president this week, one item could soon be back on the menu in school cafeterias across the US. Your question, what food or beverage is no longer banned from federally funded school nutrition programs? If you're racking your brain, this vintage ad may help you.

</details>

**Reporter**: 让你强壮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Makes you big, makes you strong.

</details>

**Reporter**: 整天。

**Reporter**: 对牙齿、骨骼和头发有好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Good for teeth and bones and hair.

</details>

**Reporter**: 是**牛奶**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: It's milk.

</details>

**Reporter**: 牛奶是大家的。全脂和 2% 牛奶在 2011 年被奥巴马政府根据《国家学校午餐计划》取消，以帮助对抗儿童肥胖。现在牛奶正在逐渐回归。牛奶消费量最近有所上升，此前已连续多年下降。卫生部长 **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** 已发誓要结束他所谓的“对全脂牛奶、奶酪和酸奶的攻击”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Milk is everybody. Full fat and 2% milk were nixed from the National School Lunch Program back in 2011 under the Obama administration to help fight childhood obesity. Now milk is having a bit of a comeback. Milk consumption rose recently after years of decline. And Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to end what he called the attack on whole milk, cheese, and yogurt.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 下一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next up,

</details>

**Reporter**: 对于一家房地产开发公司，我们现在有大项目，但我们是从小项目开始的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: for a real estate development company, we have big projects now, but we started out with little projects.

</details>

**Reporter**: 亿万富翁房地产大亨 **Stan Kroenke** 现在是美国最大的私人土地所有者。如果你想知道，这需要什么？这需要拥有比特拉华州大两倍的土地。他上个月购买了近一百万英亩的土地，这帮助他登上了榜首。他还拥有许多其他东西。所以，这是一个快速的游戏，看看他是否拥有它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: The billionaire real estate mogul Stan Kroenke is now the largest private land owner in the entire United States. If you're wondering, what does that take? It takes owning a total amount of land more than double the size of Delaware. He bought up almost a million acres just last month, which helped push him into the top spot. He also owns a lot of other stuff. So, this is a quick game of does he own it or not.

</details>

**Reporter**: 达阵传球。达阵！公羊队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: ENDZONE THROW. TOUCHDOWN RAMS.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Yep. He moved it there from St. Louis. It's a stunning state-of-the-art super stadium.

</details>

**Reporter**: 公羊队比赛的价值 50 亿美元的体育场。是的，他也拥有它。这是一块独特的地产。这是独一无二的。德克萨斯州最大的连片牧场。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

</details>

**Reporter**: 沃尔玛。不，他并不拥有沃尔玛，但他的妻子是沃尔顿家族财富的继承人之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Walmart. No, he does not own Walmart, but his wife is an heiress to the Walton family fortune.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周，一个主要的流行音乐组合宣布将在三年休整后回归，并于今年春天启动一场规模宏大的新世界巡演，横跨五大洲近 80 场演出。他们长期缺席的部分原因是乐队成员不得不完成强制兵役。我在说的是哪个流行音乐组合？提示。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And the final question of the quiz. This week, a major pop group announced that it's coming back after a three-year hiatus and launching a colossal new world tour this spring with almost 80 shows across five continents. Part of the reason for their long absence was that some of the band members had to complete mandatory military service. Which pop group am I talking about? The hint.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The super group from South Korea. Most men in the country have to serve for a time. And while there are exceptions for Olympic champions and some classical musicians, pop stars not exempt.
