### Chase的币安经历

**主持人**: 大家好，欢迎**Chase**，一个非常神秘的币圈实权派人物来到我们的节目。那**Chase**请你做个自我介绍吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Hello everyone, welcome Chase, a very mysterious and powerful figure in the crypto world, to our show. Chase, please introduce yourself.

</details>

**Chase**: 大家好，大家好。曾经实权派，现在已经落寞了，哈哈哈。要离职追求自己梦想了，放弃了巨大的权利。大家好，我是**Chase**。就像课代表讲的，最近的一份工作呢，在币圈最大的加密货币交易所**币安**做**Listing Manager**。这个工作主要是帮助这些创始人去铸造他们的**Token**，在这个交易所上面。**币安**在我加入到离职的中间，其实已经做到了年度的交易量跟**纳斯达克**是一个**level**了，所以体量是有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Hello everyone, hello everyone. Formerly powerful, now fallen, hahaha. I'm leaving to pursue my dreams, giving up immense power. Hello everyone, I'm Chase. As the class representative mentioned, my most recent job was as a **Listing Manager** at **Binance**, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the crypto world. This job primarily involved helping founders mint their **tokens** on this exchange. Between the time I joined and left, **Binance** had already achieved an annual trading volume on the same level as **Nasdaq**, so the scale is significant.

</details>

**主持人**: 你做的工作我帮大家解读一下，就是这些人他发了一个币，但是发了币他想到**币安**上去交易的话，这个**纳斯达克**交易体量的交易的话，就要经过你们团队。我的理解，你可能不能说这个，就是他大概是和证监会，然后决定一个公司能不能去上市的这个职位是类似的，所以说所有创始人们都很……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Let me explain your job to everyone. So, these people issue a coin, but if they want to trade it on **Binance**, which has a trading volume comparable to **Nasdaq**, it has to go through your team. My understanding is, you probably can't say this, but it's similar to a position at the SEC that decides whether a company can go public, so all the founders are very...

</details>

**Chase**: 功能上有**similar**的地方，但**legally**不能这么定义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Functionally, there are **similar** aspects, but **legally** it cannot be defined that way.

</details>

**主持人**: 好，请继续，你们这个团队大概多大，然后你在里边是个什么角色呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay, please continue. How big is your team, and what was your role within it?

</details>

**Chase**: 我们团队就十几个人，我这里边算是**official title**就是那个**Listing Building Manager**。我们有4个人，曾经有4个人，现在人更少了。有4个人大概是可以去对外的，真正的去**approach**跟大家聊，然后去解读大家的疑惑，去**guide**大家，去跟大家说这个事情应该**A B C D**应该怎么做，大概是这样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Our team was only about a dozen people, and my **official title** was **Listing Building Manager**. There were 4 of us, originally 4, and now even fewer. About 4 people could go out, genuinely **approach** and talk to people, interpret their doubts, **guide** them, and tell them how to do things, like **A B C D**. That's roughly it.

</details>

**主持人**: 哇，那我觉得你的这个背景，其实就有几个很重要的信息。第一个呢，你肯定要看很多项目，你是可能这个世界上看这个**Crypto**项目最多的人之一，因为这是你的工作嘛。然后因为你确实是真的是有实权，咱们这个不避讳，尤其你接下来要离职了，所以说也没有这个**conflict of interest**了。所以说那些创始人也非常看重你，就是你能得到的核心资源和信息也是非常一手和非常真实的，包括你形成了判断力嘛。然后第三个，就是你的工作之一也是跟这个行业去交流，所以说你肯定也形成了自己的看法或者说自己的见解。这几个方面我觉得是你独特的定位。那你今天你觉得可以给大家讲一些什么东西呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Wow, I think your background actually contains several important pieces of information. Firstly, you must have reviewed many projects; you're probably one of the people in the world who has seen the most **Crypto** projects, because that's your job. And because you truly held real power—let's not shy away from this, especially since you're leaving, so there's no **conflict of interest** anymore. So, those founders also valued you highly, meaning the core resources and information you could obtain were very firsthand and authentic, including the judgment you developed. And thirdly, one of your jobs was also to interact with the industry, so you must have formed your own views or insights. I think these aspects define your unique position. So, what do you think you can share with everyone today?

</details>

**Chase**: 我觉得最多能分享给大家的，还是我输入了这么多**data**之后，整个模型变成了什么样子。而且我觉得我的**data**还是比较高质量的**data**，所以说应该不是**garbage**，可以跟大家非常**honest**地分享。最高质量的数据了几乎，就是我从进公司到去年的25年，总共大概两年半的时间，看了大概1,000多不到2,000个项目。去年支持过的项目方，去真正地成功**launch token**的，大概有100个左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: I think what I can share most with everyone is what the entire model has become after I've input so much **data**. And I think my **data** is relatively high-quality **data**, so it shouldn't be **garbage**. I can share it very **honestly** with everyone. It's almost the highest quality data. From the time I joined the company until last year, 2025, in about two and a half years, I reviewed roughly between 1,000 and 2,000 projects. Last year, about 100 projects that we supported successfully **launched tokens**.

</details>

**主持人**: 跟我们讲一下这个数字背后是什么概念吧，不管是看项目和这个**launch**项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Tell us about the concept behind these numbers, both for reviewing projects and **launching** projects.

</details>

**Chase**: 看项目你可以这么理解，就是跟**VC**看项目是一样的，就是你得看**deck**，你得看团队，你还得跟他聊，跟他**call**，然后自己去做一些判断，这是最基础的。然后**VC**一年我觉得有个200个就挺不错了，就挺厉害了，你还要不停地跟那些创始人去沟通。但我两年多时间看了1,000多个，光去年上了就是100个。100个什么概念？就是**币安**在我刚进去的时候，一年就二十几个，整个公司一年只上二十几个。然后第二年上了五十几个六十个，到第三年就是25年，去年一年我一个人就上了100个。然后又是牛市来了，总共上了多少个？怎么样，也有250、300左右吧，得要有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: You can understand project review as being similar to how **VCs** review projects: you have to look at the **deck**, you have to look at the team, you have to talk to them, **call** them, and then make your own judgments. That's the most basic. For a **VC**, I think reviewing 200 projects a year is pretty good, quite impressive, and you also have to constantly communicate with the founders. But in over two years, I reviewed more than 1,000, and last year alone, 100 were listed. What does 100 mean? When I first joined **Binance**, they listed only about twenty-something projects a year, the whole company listed only twenty-something. Then in the second year, it was fifty-something or sixty, and by the third year, 2025, I alone listed 100 projects in that year. And then the bull market came, how many were listed in total? Around 250, maybe 300.

</details>

**主持人**: 反正你一个人占了快半壁江山。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Anyway, you alone accounted for almost half of them.

</details>

**Chase**: 1/3。没有没有，1/3差不多，因为我们总共就四个人嘛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: One-third. No, no, about one-third, because there were only four of us in total.

</details>

**主持人**: 总共才四个人，这个筛选成功率大概是5%到10%的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Only four people in total, and the success rate of this screening is about 5% to 10%.

</details>

### Crypto世界的经济循环

**主持人**: 我想先你帮大家解读一下这个世界，就是很多可能不了解**Crypto**的人是怎么理解这个世界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'd like you to help everyone understand this world first, especially how many people who don't know **Crypto** perceive it.

</details>

**Chase**: 首先你可以把它当做一个**Virtual**的一个世界，这个世界它有自己的一套经济循环的机制。如果你把它当做一个国家的话，那么它是需要美元来作为流动性的支持的。但是呢它的输出，它的出口就是它的**service**，它只有**service**，只有第三产业。它的第一产业它需要的农业是什么？需要的是算力跟电。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: First, you can think of it as a **virtual** world, and this world has its own set of economic circulation mechanisms. If you treat it as a country, then it needs the US dollar to support its liquidity. But its output, its export, is its **service**; it only has **service**, only the tertiary industry. What is the agriculture it needs for its primary industry? It needs computing power and electricity.

</details>

**主持人**: 这句话怎么理解？什么叫做输出的是第三产业？因为我们经常会说，我们是不是可以用**比特币**去买披萨了呀，这种话对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How should I understand that statement? What does it mean that its output is the tertiary industry? Because we often say things like, "Can we use **Bitcoin** to buy pizza now?" right?

</details>

**Chase**: 这还不是。我为什么说是第三产业，就是**比特币**虽然市占率很大，50% 60%，但是它并不是这个行业最核心的，我们讲可以吹泡泡的地方。它可以作为一个价值储存，但它不能提供很多的**service**。价值储存其实就是我们讲说所谓的流动性支撑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: That's not it. Why do I say it's the tertiary industry? Although **Bitcoin** has a large market share, 50% to 60%, it's not the core of this industry, not where we can talk about bubbles. It can serve as a store of value, but it can't provide many **services**. Store of value is essentially what we refer to as liquidity support.

</details>

### DeFi与闪电贷

**Chase**: 为什么说是第三产业？就是这个行业，比如说从**以太坊**出来之后，很多智慧合约可以**enable**的一些功能，比如说像**DeFi**，这些事情其实是可以对传统的金融行业造成很大的冲击的。然后**SEC（美国证券交易委员会）**我记得前几个周吧，有人在说，可能未来两年之内，就26跟27两年，几乎所有的**Wall Street**的这些主流的这些机构都会上链。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Why do I say it's the tertiary industry? It's because in this industry, for example, after **Ethereum** emerged, many smart contracts could **enable** certain functionalities, such as **DeFi**. These things can actually have a significant impact on the traditional financial industry. And the **SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)**, I remember a few weeks ago, someone was saying that within the next two years, specifically 2026 and 2027, almost all mainstream **Wall Street** institutions will be on-chain.

</details>

**主持人**: 关于**DeFi**，其实之前就是邀请了**Richard 友忠**（**Huma Finance**创始人），他来我们频道去讲了一下他做的项目。基本上就是帮助这些已经在做贸易的公司吧，在金融上减少摩擦，不管是**exchange currency**还是这个借贷，都可以帮助他们减少摩擦，提高效率。就是一个**service**给传统或者说是非**Crypto**带来价值的一个很明显的点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Regarding **DeFi**, we actually invited **Richard Youzhong** (founder of **Huma Finance**) to our channel to talk about his project. Basically, it helps companies already engaged in trade reduce friction in finance, whether it's **exchanging currency** or lending, it helps them reduce friction and increase efficiency. It's a clear example of a **service** bringing value to traditional or non-**Crypto** sectors.

</details>

**Chase**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Right.

</details>

**主持人**: 可不可以再请你列一下在你看来比较主要的这些点都有哪些？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Could you please list some of the other main points you see?

</details>

**Chase**: 你刚才讲的是这个行业对外输出服务跟价值的地方，这是没有问题的。但除此之外，这个行业还有它很特别的地方，比如说**Flash loan**（**闪电贷**），大概大部分人都没有听过。它什么意思？比如说你去找别人找银行借钱，你要么是有质押物对吧，要么你的信用评分非常高或怎么样的，你总得有个东西让银行去给你放贷。那么**闪电贷**的能力就在于，你可以在没有任何抵押物的情况下，同时银行也没有风险的情况下，完成这个借贷跟收款。几乎所有跟支付相关的**Crypto**都可以**enable**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: What you just mentioned is where this industry exports services and value, and that's correct. But beyond that, this industry has its very unique aspects, such as **Flash loan** (flash loan), which most people probably haven't heard of. What does it mean? For example, if you go to a bank to borrow money, you either have collateral, right, or your credit score is very high or something; you always need something for the bank to lend you money. The capability of a **flash loan** is that you can complete the borrowing and repayment without any collateral, and at the same time, without any risk to the bank. Almost all payment-related **Crypto** can **enable** this.

</details>

### AI与Crypto的未来融合

**Chase**: 最重要的，也是我可能未来马上要写的，就是跟**AI**相关的一个**paper**。我打比方**let's say**，五年之后，世界上**AI**就是我们现在的**Scaling law**这样继续发展的话，**AI agent**的数量一定会超过人口的数量，对不对？那么基于这个假设，你如何去**measure AI agent**之间所产生的这个经济行为？你去**call its API**，**FINE**。你现在是一个**subscription**的这个**model**，但很多时候，我可能只需要去，第一有很多长尾的数据，比如说只有你有的数据，或者只有我的数据，**call**一次怎么来结算，对不对？获得这个数据数据量非常非常的小，现有的银行体系也没法去帮他结算。这些所有的经济行为都需要第一被**measure**，被衡量。其次，所有人都得**trust**这个事情，他才能成功。这也是**Crypto**可以**enable**或者是跟**AI**合作的地方。这也是为什么很多圈内的人在想，这个**Crypto**本身可能不是给人用的，我们设计成这个样子，可能未来就是给**AI**用的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: The most important thing, and something I might write about soon, is an **AI**-related **paper**. For example, **let's say** five years from now, if **AI** in the world continues to develop according to our current **scaling law**, the number of **AI agents** will definitely exceed the human population, right? So, based on this assumption, how do you **measure** the economic activities generated between **AI agents**? You **call its API**, **FINE**. You currently have a **subscription model**, but often, I might only need to access long-tail data, for example, data only you have, or only I have. How do you settle a single **call**, right? The amount of data obtained is very, very small, and the existing banking system cannot settle it. All these economic activities need to be **measured** first, to be quantified. Secondly, everyone needs to **trust** this for it to succeed. This is where **Crypto** can **enable** or collaborate with **AI**. This is also why many people in the industry are thinking that **Crypto** itself might not be for humans; designed this way, it might be for **AI** in the future.

</details>

**主持人**: 采访**友忠**（**Huma Finance**创始人）的时候他也讲了，我到现在都记得一句话，就是他觉得**AI**是生产力，然后**Crypto**是生产关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When I interviewed **Youzhong** (founder of **Huma Finance**), he also said something I still remember: he believes **AI** is productivity, and **Crypto** is production relations.

</details>

**Chase**: 其实**Crypto**也有生产力，也有生产关系。但是**Crypto**真的可以改变生产关系，是因为就讲得大一点，**ideology**一点，就是有个资本平权的概念在里边。你想如果你现在生活在大陆，你习惯了支付宝，习惯了这个余额宝，对吧，你的钱存在那里，它自动生息是很理所当然的事情。但你在北美，在欧洲你可能就要单独去银行，银行得有个门槛，然后给你的利率还非常低。但**Crypto**就把整个世界完全平权化了，钱就是钱，我不管你是谁的钱，你只要存进来，符合我的这个**standard**，那你就可以拿到同样的收益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Actually, **Crypto** also has productivity and production relations. But **Crypto** can truly change production relations because, to put it broadly, ideologically, there's a concept of capital equalization within it. Imagine if you live in mainland China, you're used to Alipay, used to Yu'e Bao, right? Your money sitting there automatically earning interest is a matter of course. But in North America, in Europe, you might have to go to a bank separately, and banks have thresholds, and the interest rates they give you are very low. But **Crypto** has completely equalized the entire world; money is money. I don't care whose money it is; as long as you deposit it and it meets my **standard**, you can get the same returns.

</details>

**主持人**: 刚刚说了，就是支付本身在这里边就是一个很大的体系，然后**Crypto**在这里边可以提供很多价值，然后改变生产关系又是一个价值。还有没有其他的，在你看来**Crypto**比较大的价值的点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You just mentioned that payment itself is a huge system here, and **Crypto** can provide a lot of value in it, and changing production relations is another value. Are there any other major value points for **Crypto** in your opinion?

</details>

**Chase**: 讲的比较现实一点，它可以帮助所有流动性超发的国家承载更多的流动性，并且不影响通胀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: To be more realistic, it can help all countries with excess liquidity carry more liquidity without affecting inflation.

</details>

**主持人**: 明白，就价值储存。你觉得这个和黄金有什么特别大的区别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Understood, so store of value. Do you think there's any significant difference between this and gold?

</details>

**Chase**: 你这个问题问得非常好。你看我**share**给你这个**link**里边有一张贴图，这个贴图是什么？首先我问你个问题，你觉得美股从**Dot-com Bubble**到现在，它是熊市还是牛市？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: That's a very good question. Look, there's an image in the **link** I **shared** with you. What is this image? First, let me ask you a question: do you think the US stock market, from the **Dot-com Bubble** until now, has been in a bear market or a bull market?

</details>

**主持人**: 它是牛市。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's a bull market.

</details>

**Chase**: 对呀，你拿**S&P 500**来说，它就是牛市。但是对于黄金，它是熊市。我给你看的那个图就是在说这个意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Exactly, if you look at the **S&P 500**, it's a bull market. But for gold, it's a bear market. The chart I showed you illustrates this point.

</details>

**主持人**: 对，**interesting**。就是在说你印的钱推动了这个**标普500**的增长，但是依然没有超过黄金，就是抗通胀的这个增长速度。哇哦，所以**S&P**比黄金还……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right, **interesting**. So, you're saying the money printed fueled the growth of the **S&P 500**, but it still didn't surpass gold's inflation-fighting growth rate. Wow, so the **S&P** is even more...

</details>

**Chase**: 这是**Lyn Alden**，非常有名的一个作者发的。他的**research**，我可以一会儿把链接给你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: This was published by **Lyn Alden**, a very famous author. It's her **research**, I can give you the link later.

</details>

### 货币超发与资产定价

**主持人**: **Interesting**，**interesting**，**interesting**。这是对我投资的一个很大的认知改变。我之前**TMD**学的被经济学耽误的这个错误的科班的投资理论，就会觉得这个股价是未来收入折现什么的。也有道理吧，但是我后来就意识到了，为什么美股大家都说**bubble**要破了，然后这个每10年要跌一次什么的，但是没有发生。就是为什么？我后来想，就是因为货币印多了以后就没地儿去。之前大家没有办法产生那么多货币的，现在产生了这么多货币，它就是得去一个地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **Interesting**, **interesting**, **interesting**. This is a huge shift in my investment understanding. Before, the flawed academic investment theory I learned, which was hampered by economics, made me think that stock prices were discounted future earnings or something. That makes sense, but then I realized why everyone says the US stock market **bubble** is going to burst, and it's supposed to fall every 10 years or something, but it hasn't happened. Why? I later thought, it's because when too much money is printed, it has nowhere to go. Before, people couldn't generate that much currency, but now that so much currency has been generated, it has to go somewhere.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，是的。你想我们的商品跟服务增长，比如说每年5%百分之几对吧，你的货币增发量，包括你的信用增长，是完全超过这个速度的。那么你多余的钱除了变成**bubble**以外，就得找到新的服务或者是资产去定价。为什么有新的资产来定价？就是因为币圈**Crypto**，它可以一直发行非常低成本的发行资产，而且它这个权证你是不需要去一个中央的机构去**verify**的。那么只要大家相信你这个资产有价值，就会有新的流动性进来，就会去承接这些流动性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, exactly. Think about it, our goods and services grow, say, by 5% or a few percent annually, right? Your money supply increase, including your credit growth, completely outpaces that rate. So, your excess money, besides turning into a **bubble**, has to find new services or assets to price. Why are there new assets to price? Because in the crypto world, **Crypto** can continuously issue assets at a very low cost, and its warrants don't require verification by a central institution. So, as long as people believe your asset has value, new liquidity will flow in and absorb that liquidity.

</details>

**主持人**: 只需要你来**verify**之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You just need to **verify** it beforehand.

</details>

**Chase**: 是的，只需要你自己去判断嘛。不是只需要你！你！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, you just need to judge for yourself. Not just you! You!

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，我个人是吧？你！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, me personally, right? You!

</details>

**Chase**: 没有没有，我只是个打工的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: No, no, I'm just an employee.

</details>

**主持人**: 是个打工的，牛马牛马。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Just an employee, a workhorse.

</details>

### 预测市场Polymarket

**主持人**: 最近比较火的一个项目叫**Polymarket**，相信你也听过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A recently popular project is called **Polymarket**, I believe you've heard of it.

</details>

**Chase**: 我不了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: I'm not familiar.

</details>

**主持人**: 可以跟大家讲一下吧。我其实听过，但是我不是很了解，我一直觉得他听起来像是一个骗子，然后我就没看了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Could you tell everyone about it? I've actually heard of it, but I don't know much about it. I always thought it sounded like a scam, so I didn't look into it.

</details>

**Chase**: **OK**，他第一次火是川普大选那年。**Basically**是个预测市场，他讲是预测市场，其实是个二元期权。他就是比大选结果出来提前几个小时是先知道的。他的逻辑在于什么？他认为这个世界上总有人对一件事情有**inside information**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: **OK**, it first became popular during the Trump election year. It's **basically** a prediction market, though he calls it a prediction market, it's actually a binary option. He knew the election results hours before they were officially announced. What's his logic? He believes that there's always someone in the world with **inside information** about an event.

</details>

**主持人**: 同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Agreed.

</details>

**Chase**: 那么你这个**inside information**就应该被**priced**，就应该被定价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Then your **inside information** should be **priced**, it should be valued.

</details>

**主持人**: 对，这就是一个给它定价的市场。好的，他不是骗子。好有道理，哈哈哈，一句话说服了我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right, this is a market that prices it. Okay, he's not a scammer. That makes sense, hahaha, you convinced me with one sentence.

</details>

**Chase**: 哈哈哈，这就是**exactly what happened**。我跟那个**founder**关系也蛮好，经常吃饭喝酒啥的。然后呢现在你可以变相地理解为，在去全球化的这个大的背景下，**Crypto**是一个保持全球化非常**strong**的一个**sector**。而这个**sector**，它把所有的信息都放在同样的网上，所有的信息都可以被定价。信息可以变成资产，流量可以变成资产，任何的交易，任何的**idea**都可以变成资产。而这个资产只要有流动性，就可以被承接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Hahaha, that's **exactly what happened**. I'm quite good friends with that **founder**, we often have meals and drinks. So, now you can indirectly understand that, in the larger context of de-globalization, **Crypto** is a very **strong sector** that maintains globalization. And this **sector** puts all information on the same network, where all information can be priced. Information can become an asset, traffic can become an asset, any transaction, any **idea** can become an asset. And as long as this asset has liquidity, it can be absorbed.

</details>

### AI经济体的衡量

**Chase**: 就像回到我之前跟你讲，我为什么要写**AI paper**。这个问题就是，我认为未来**agent**产生的**GDP**或者是经济体量，一定会大于人类的经济体量。那个时候你没有一个**measurement**，你没有一定的**infra**是做不到的。那么现在现成的**infra**，就是**Crypto**这个**infra**。但是经济学上呢，又或者是学术圈，又没有一个**index**出来说现在这个**agent**到底是什么样子。现在我们只能通过**Google**的报表对吧，**OpenAI**的融资数据，**Oracle**这些建**data center**这些厂，那**CapEx**来估算一下**AI**可能未来是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: It's like going back to what I told you before, why I want to write an **AI paper**. The issue is, I believe that in the future, the **GDP** or economic volume generated by **agents** will definitely exceed that of humans. At that time, you won't be able to do it without a **measurement**, without certain **infra**. So, the existing **infra** now is this **Crypto infra**. But in economics, or in academia, there isn't an **index** yet to say what this **agent** actually looks like. Currently, we can only estimate what **AI** might look like in the future by looking at **Google**'s reports, right, **OpenAI**'s funding data, and the **CapEx** of companies like **Oracle** building **data centers**.

</details>

**主持人**: 明白了。你要用**first principle**来想的话，其实就是应该每个**agent**，每个**transaction**我都去**measure**，而且它是非常**precise**的。我给我频道的观众稍稍解读一下，我的理解就是有两个核心问题。第一个就是**AI**到底价值多大，**AI**值不值钱，这个我们其实很难定价。因为现在如果只看**OpenAI**的收入的话，没多少钱，几十**billion**对吧，不大。但是戴雨森就提了一个想法，我当时还在一个活动里面做了**survey**，就是我如果买断你未来**ChatGPT**的使用权，你就不许用**ChatGPT**这样的服务了，不许使用任何这种新的**AI**了，你愿意花多少钱被买断？我问在座应该我问到10万美元的时候就一个人举手，100来个人只有一个人举手。问到100万的时候很多人还没有举手。100万美元。所以说就这个东西价值是极大的，可是我没有办法去**measure**。第二个就是我们去说**AI**它到底产生了多少**productivity**（生产力），**GDP**其实是很难**measure**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Understood. If you think about it from **first principles**, it means every **agent**, every **transaction** should be **measured**, and it should be very **precise**. Let me briefly explain to my channel's audience. My understanding is there are two core issues. The first is how much **AI** is worth, whether **AI** is valuable. This is actually very hard for us to price. Because right now, if you only look at **OpenAI**'s revenue, it's not much, tens of **billions**, right, not huge. But Dai Yusen proposed an idea, and I did a **survey** at an event then: if I bought out your future right to use **ChatGPT**, you wouldn't be allowed to use services like **ChatGPT** anymore, or any new **AI**, how much would you be willing to pay to be bought out? When I asked the audience, at $100,000, only one person raised their hand; out of about 100 people, only one. When I asked at $1 million, many still hadn't raised their hands. $1 million. So, the value of this thing is enormous, but I have no way to **measure** it. The second is about how much **productivity** **AI** actually generates. **GDP** is actually very hard to **measure**.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，**GDP**是特别错的。**G**是**gross**对吧，但其实不是**gross**。每一次你**API call**，你都可以去**precise measure**。第二它是**domestic**，**AI**也不是**domestic**，是**global**的东西。第三它也不是一个**product**，不是个成形的**product**，它是很多中间态的。所以**GDP**每一个单词都是错的。你就用这个去**measure AI**的话，这也是为什么我们一定要有个新的这个**index**，新的起码是微观的**measurement**，然后在那之上能不能出来一个宏观的**index**也很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, **GDP** is particularly flawed. **G** stands for **gross**, right, but it's not actually **gross**. Every time you make an **API call**, you can **precisely measure** it. Secondly, it's **domestic**, but **AI** isn't **domestic**; it's a **global** thing. Thirdly, it's not a **product**, not a finished **product**; it's many intermediate states. So, every word in **GDP** is wrong. If you use this to **measure AI**, that's why we absolutely need a new **index**, at least a new microscopic **measurement**, and then it's also very important whether a macroscopic **index** can emerge from that.

</details>

**主持人**: 有的我们已经在写了，已经有一个框架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We're already writing some, there's already a framework.

</details>

**Chase**: 我的意思是说这个宏观和微观的**link**，就是能写一个框架，但是**OpenAI**给不给你**measure**这是另外一回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: My point is about the **link** between macro and micro; you can write a framework, but whether **OpenAI** allows you to **measure** it is another matter.

</details>

**主持人**: 你讲的很对。这里边可能说，当**agent**数量发展到一定程度的时候，有一两个**killer App**出来的时候，你可能不会100%地去需要**OpenAI**去管理你的数据，去**care**你的数据，收集你的数据。你自己比如说**locally host**一个你自己的**agent**就可以了。然后呢你这个**agent**去帮你复杂任务的时候，去靠云端的**agent**，对吧，有**daily**任务的时候，你自己家里就可以做了。我家里有两个**MacBook**，一个**MacBook**一个**Mac mini**，我把它串起来，就可以跑一个千问31B的模型在家里。然后我的数据都是**local**的，也非常非常好用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're absolutely right. It's possible that when the number of **agents** develops to a certain extent, and one or two **killer Apps** emerge, you might not 100% need **OpenAI** to manage your data, **care** for your data, or collect your data. You could, for example, **locally host** your own **agent**. Then, when your **agent** helps you with complex tasks, it relies on cloud-based **agents**, right? For **daily** tasks, you can do them at home yourself. I have two **MacBooks**, one **MacBook** and one **Mac mini**, and I can link them up to run a Qwen 31B model at home. And my data is all **local**, which is also very, very useful.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们又回到价值创造去了，我们先赶紧聊钱，哈哈哈，来来来，我们先聊大家最关心的问题吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We've gone back to value creation. Let's quickly talk about money, hahaha, come on, let's discuss the question everyone cares about most.

</details>

### 比特币的操盘逻辑

**主持人**: **比特币**2026年会涨会跌？来做个预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Will **Bitcoin** rise or fall in 2026? Make a prediction.

</details>

**Chase**: 涨，一定会涨，一定会到**all time high**。但是以什么样的方式，大概是你没有想过的方式。为什么呢？就回到我之前那个话题，一切信息都可以被定价了。现在在币圈无论是谁，他都可以在这个网络里被定价。当大家形成一个共识的时候，你的共识就会被定价，就会有反共识的人来**cash out**你。**OK**，这可能有点深。如果你做过**market maker**，如果你知道**quant trading**的话，你会发现永远是一个大鱼吃小鱼，但是呢少数人吃多数人的过程。当你多数人形成了一个大的共识，那就大概率会被变成一个**target**，别人就会**price**你这个**target**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: It will rise, it will definitely rise, it will reach an **all-time high**. But in a way you probably haven't imagined. Why? It goes back to my previous point: all information can be priced. Now, in the crypto world, anyone can be priced within this network. When everyone forms a consensus, your consensus will be priced, and those who go against the consensus will **cash out** on you. **OK**, this might be a bit deep. If you've been a **market maker**, if you know **quant trading**, you'll find it's always a big fish eating small fish, but it's also a process where the few eat the many. When the majority forms a large consensus, it's highly likely to become a **target**, and others will **price** that **target**.

</details>

**主持人**: 就是说当大家都以为这个东西要跌的时候，然后它就涨了，它反而不会跌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, when everyone thinks it's going to fall, it rises instead, and doesn't fall.

</details>

**Chase**: 为什么？就是在你知道会跌，你会被**convinced**，会被跌的时候，其实你已经被社会工程了（**social engineered**）。我说的是**general**大众，不是指你个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Why? Because when you know it's going to fall, when you're **convinced** it will fall, you've actually been **social engineered**. I'm talking about the **general** public, not you personally.

</details>

**主持人**: 但这个感觉也不是什么新鲜事，就是我们股市庄家的这个操盘逻辑。对，有人能操**比特币**的盘吗？这么大的盘，或者它真的很大吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But this doesn't feel like anything new; it's just the market maker's manipulation logic in our stock market. Right, can anyone manipulate **Bitcoin**? Such a large market, or is it really that large?

</details>

**Chase**: **比特币**的**market cap**现在是二点几还是三个**trillion US dollar**，所以体量是不小的，是黄金的1/10左右，大概是这个量级。去年大概2月份4月份的时候，有一个星期，**比特币**的这个**k**线，如果你去看日**k**的话，每天以同样的幅度，同样的量，连续往上走了7天，然后突然往下走。这什么意思？一般这种**pattern**是出现在有一个强势的庄，可以控制整个筹码的这种情况。也就是说，某些人或者是某个集团，在那一天想向世界宣布，**guys**，这个东西我已经**control**了，就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: **Bitcoin**'s **market cap** is currently two-something or three **trillion US dollars**, so the scale is not small, it's about 1/10th of gold, roughly that magnitude. Last year, around February or April, there was one week where **Bitcoin**'s **candlestick chart**, if you look at the daily **k**-line, moved up for 7 consecutive days with the same magnitude and volume, and then suddenly dropped. What does this mean? This kind of **pattern** usually appears when there's a strong market maker who can control the entire supply of chips. In other words, certain individuals or a certain group, on that day, wanted to announce to the world, **guys**, I've **controlled** this thing, it's that simple.

</details>

**主持人**: **OK**，他不光是**control**了，然后他直接是告诉大家，他是在发了一个明确的信号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **OK**, he not only **controlled** it, but he directly told everyone that he was sending a clear signal.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，他希望什么？他希望你**join**他，他希望你看得懂的**join**他，去吃掉那些看不懂的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Right, what does he want? He wants you to **join** him, he wants those who understand to **join** him, to take advantage of those who don't.

</details>

**主持人**: 我去，哪一天我赶紧看一看是什么。我给你找一下，我给你找一下。我靠，**hh**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Wow, I need to quickly check what day that was. Let me find it for you, let me find it for you. Oh my god, **hh**.

</details>

**Chase**: 哈哈，这个行业非常非常有意思的。这个人是谁？没有具体的人，你也永远不会知道是谁。它是这样，这里边有很多做市商，传统金融的跟**Crypto**的做市商，其实很多是**overlap**的。那么这些做市商他不会去看基本面，他只会看市场的流动性，只会看他自己相信的信号。那一旦这几个信号出来，他就会**trigger**同样的这个交易的手法。我刚才描述的这种情况，它是属于什么？属于要么当时的市场流动性就是被这几家同样算法的人控制了，那么大家相互印证了，**OK guys**，我们都一帮了，对吧。或者就是自己觉得其他有筹码的人或者有钱的人不会参与进来，不会在这个时间段参与到我这个**game**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Haha, this industry is very, very interesting. Who is this person? There's no specific person, and you'll never know who it is. It's like this: there are many market makers, both traditional finance and **Crypto** market makers, and many of them actually **overlap**. So, these market makers don't look at fundamentals; they only look at market liquidity and the signals they believe in. Once these signals appear, they will **trigger** the same trading strategy. What I just described, what does it belong to? It belongs to either the market liquidity at that time being controlled by these few entities with similar algorithms, so everyone confirmed each other, **OK guys**, we're all in this together, right? Or they simply believe that other people with chips or money won't get involved, won't participate in my **game** during this period.

</details>

**主持人**: 大概是一年前，一年前的某一天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: About a year ago, one day a year ago.

</details>

**Chase**: 我下来找到给你吧。好，找到截图给你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: I'll find it and send it to you. Okay, I'll find the screenshot and send it to you.

</details>

**主持人**: 继续。**比特币**出现了这样的一个内行人知道，专家操盘的这样一个趋势。那如果说这样的话，那肯定就是像你说的，他已经可以割，而且会这种方式，那大家听懂就行了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Continue. **Bitcoin** showed such a trend that insiders knew, a trend of expert manipulation. So if that's the case, then it's definitely as you said, he can already cut, and will do so in this way, so everyone just needs to understand.

</details>

### 币圈资产估值与长期投资

**主持人**: 那接下来呢，你刚刚也讲到就是**比特币**，这和我的认知是一致的，就是**比特币**在区块链里边是一个价值储存，其实就是一个我们都基于黄金去做交易，然后那个金库的感觉。那真正的就是你想要去在这里边赚大钱，或者赔大钱，其实都是**比特币**以外的东西。就是这个金子的价值再怎么涨跌，其实它也是相对稳定的，就是你涨到**all time high**，比起现在，可能也就是涨了百分之三四十而已。那剩下的除了加杠杆大家去交易以外，你看到的还有什么东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So what's next? You just mentioned **Bitcoin**, and this aligns with my understanding: **Bitcoin** serves as a store of value within the blockchain, essentially like a gold vault that we all use for transactions. But truly making or losing a lot of money in this space actually involves things beyond **Bitcoin**. Even if the value of this gold fluctuates, it's relatively stable; if it reaches an **all-time high**, compared to now, it might only be a 30% to 40% increase. Besides everyone trading with leverage, what else do you see?

</details>

**Chase**: 这里边就可能要回到你之前对传统经济学的一些学习的内容了。一是估值推动的对吧，二是流动性，或者是真正基本面推动的。那么币圈的估值体系跟传统金融还不一样，它主要是三部分构成。一个是什么？一个是流动性，一个是流量，就是注意力。最后一个就是整个你这个筹码结构，这些就是我们所谓的**Tokenomics**。这三个板块几乎决定了你这个标的，这个资产在中短期会是什么样子。没有人看长期，没有人看长期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: This might go back to what you learned about traditional economics. One is valuation-driven, right, and the other is liquidity, or truly fundamental-driven. However, the valuation system in the crypto world is different from traditional finance; it's mainly composed of three parts. What are they? One is liquidity, one is traffic, which is attention. The last one is your entire chip structure, which is what we call **Tokenomics**. These three segments almost determine what your target, this asset, will look like in the short to medium term. No one looks long-term, no one looks long-term.

</details>

**主持人**: 中短期是多短？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How short is short to medium term?

</details>

**Chase**: 一般是7天到3个月，几乎就能看出一个资产大概的走向。但是这个，比如说你像**Richard**做的项目，他们项目其实是非常非常好的项目，但是发币上，因为他们之前也没有经验嘛，所以说也没有发的特别好。但是从长期来看，这个项目是非常非常值得大家去关注的。打个比方，他们最近刚出了那个**Defensive Loopring**，一个新的功能，一个新的**feature**，就是变相地帮你把他们认为风险非常低的资产帮你去加一些杠杆，然后呢不会让你去受损失。几乎在这个**smart contract level**，它的结果是什么呢？就是可以让你拿到大概17%、16%左右的年化收益。十几个点这是非常非常可观的，而且它对资金体量是没有太多的上限的。你放几个**million**进去，你就可以躺平了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Generally, it's 7 days to 3 months; you can almost see the general direction of an asset. But for example, a project like **Richard**'s, their project is actually very, very good, but when it came to issuing tokens, because they didn't have much experience before, it wasn't done particularly well. However, from a long-term perspective, this project is very, very worth paying attention to. For example, they recently launched **Defensive Loopring**, a new function, a new **feature**, which indirectly helps you leverage assets they consider very low risk, and it won't cause you losses. Almost at the **smart contract level**, what's the result? It can give you an annualized return of about 17% to 16%. A dozen percentage points is very, very substantial, and it doesn't have much of an upper limit on the capital amount. You can put in a few **million** and just relax.

</details>

**主持人**: 那正好这是一个很好的案例，就是为什么他们的币反而价格没有起来，就是**underlying**已经做的这么好了。那决定币的价格，或者是中间的**gap**是什么造成的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's a great example then: why hasn't their coin's price risen, even though the **underlying** work is so good? What determines the coin's price, or what causes the **gap** in between?

</details>

**Chase**: 当你的这个币，这个资产出去流通了之后，说实话第一你自己不能**control**了，就全是市场（行为）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Once your coin, this asset, goes into circulation, honestly, first, you can't **control** it yourself; it's all market (behavior).

</details>

**主持人**: 是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes.

</details>

**Chase**: 但是呢因为市场，参与这个市场定价的这些主体，要么是散户，他看不懂，要么是这些做市商，他有非常强大的资金，但是他自己又不在乎**value**，他只在乎短期的**profit**。所以就会造成大家都去短择没有长择。那么什么时候入场呢？特别是像你或者是**tradfi**（传统金融从业者），甚至是我现在的这种状况，想要做长择，都是在他们第一波完了之后，大家会发现他仍有价值，而他的**token**已经不再受流动性跟**attention**影响之后，这个时候的估值才是相对公允的一个估值。比如说你去看**Richard**那个项目**Huma**，他现在估值可能也就300个**mil**，3个亿美金左右。但他其实就我看来，值个两个**billion**问题不大的。只是在等风。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: But because of the market, the entities participating in pricing this market are either retail investors who don't understand, or market makers who have very strong capital but don't care about **value**; they only care about short-term **profit**. This leads to everyone making short-term choices without long-term ones. So when do you enter? Especially for someone like you, or a **tradfi** (traditional finance professional), or even in my current situation, wanting to make long-term choices, it's always after their first wave is over, when people realize it still has value, and its **token** is no longer affected by liquidity and **attention**. At this point, the valuation is a relatively fair one. For example, if you look at **Richard**'s project, **Huma**, its current valuation might only be around 300 **mil**, about 300 million US dollars. But in my opinion, it's easily worth two **billion**. It's just waiting for the wind.

</details>

**主持人**: 就现在基本上炒已经炒完了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, basically, the hype is over now.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，**exactly**，投机的那一波已经玩完了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, **exactly**, that speculative wave is over.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得看**Crypto**的交易，就是**币安**上的这些**Crypto**交易就非常生动地体现了股票市场有所谓价值的部分，然后有所谓交易的部分，然后有所谓炒或者说是这个庄家控制的部分。然后就很难看清楚，但是在**Crypto**上就特别明显，特别清晰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think observing **Crypto** trading, specifically **Crypto** trading on **Binance**, vividly illustrates how the stock market has a so-called value component, a trading component, and a speculative or market-maker-controlled component. It's often hard to see clearly in traditional markets, but in **Crypto**, it's exceptionally obvious and clear.

</details>

**Chase**: 所以说淋漓尽致，大家都不演的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: So it's fully displayed, everyone is transparent.

</details>

**主持人**: 大家不演的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Everyone is transparent.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，不演的。因为他现在还没有被定义成**security**，那你能管他的法规就很少。那很多人就开始作恶，对吧，很难避免。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, transparent. Because it hasn't been defined as a **security** yet, there are very few regulations that can govern it. So many people start to do bad things, right, it's hard to avoid.

</details>

### 孙宇晨与稳定币巨头

**主持人**: 讲到这里，那我们就开始引入一个完全不演的人，或者说他可能全都是在演戏，就是我最近在看**《凡人修仙传》**这个**南陇侯**，他就是一个演自己，是一个这样，其实是一个心计深沉之人。**孙割**，**孙宇晨**来，你应该了解不少他的故事吧。我觉得他是一个很好的案例，可以跟我们讲讲这里边的人物画像和他们的背后动机。其实扑朔迷离，就是哪地儿都有他，所以就搞不清楚他到底是割了钱，是自己真的很有钱呢，还是假的很有钱。这种东西怎么看，给点内部信息吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Speaking of which, let's introduce someone who is completely transparent, or perhaps entirely acting. I've recently been reading **"A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality"**, and this **Nanlong Hou** character, he's just playing himself, a person with deep cunning. **Sun Ge**, **Justin Sun**, you must know a lot about his stories. I think he's a great case study to tell us about the character profiles and their underlying motivations in this space. It's quite perplexing; he's everywhere, so it's hard to figure out if he's actually made a lot of money, is genuinely rich, or just pretending to be. How do you discern these things? Give us some inside information.

</details>

**Chase**: 内部信息，我们先聊**南陇侯**吧。毕竟人家是**苍坤上人**的后人，对吧，肯定是要藏着掖着。修仙世界在他**忘语**（**《凡人修仙传》**作者）的那个环境里边，就是勾心斗角的，这个你没办法，这是他的保护伞。即便是这样，他还是被阴了，对不对，所以很难讲。然后**孙割**呢，我跟他没有个人交集，我也不太好评头论足什么。但是他是真有钱，这个是业内公认的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Inside information, let's talk about **Nanlong Hou** first. After all, he's a descendant of **Cang Kun Shang Ren**, right? He definitely has to hide things. In the cultivation world, within **Wang Yu**'s (**"A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality"** author) setting, it's all about scheming and intrigue; you can't help it, that's his protective umbrella. Even so, he was still tricked, right? So it's hard to say. As for **Sun Ge**, I don't have any personal dealings with him, so it's hard for me to comment much. But he is genuinely rich, that's publicly acknowledged within the industry.

</details>

**主持人**: 知道他很有钱，就这件事对外员可能来说是一个问号，当然业内肯定是一个确定性的100%。那这个业内知道的东西是什么？应该也是公开信息吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Knowing he's rich, that fact might be a question mark for outsiders, but within the industry, it's definitely 100% certain. So what is it that the industry knows? It should be public information, right?

</details>

**Chase**: 他有公开的地址，就在链上公开的地址。他这有个公链叫**Tron**，对吧，你知道**USDT**吧？其实**USDT**最大的**parking space**就在**Tron**上边。也就是说**Tron**跟**USDT**是共生的关系，至少在之前。而且你想**USDT**印了这么多货币出来，我忘了是60%还是百分之多少，我现在可以看一下，还是讲真实数据跟大家比较好。**Tron**上边现在有4.7个**billion**，就是所谓的**TVL**。**USDT**在**Tron**上边有80个**billion**。这什么概念？就是它最大的**以太坊**46.77%，然后第二就是**Tron** 43.07%。这就百分之八十几了。而**USDT Tether**他们一年的收入是150亿美金，纯利润几乎是。你想**OpenAI**一年赔几十亿，**Anthropic**一年赔几十亿，这两个加起来都不如**Tether**的这个收入多。你赔的钱都不如人家赚的多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: He has public addresses, public addresses on the chain. He has a public chain called **Tron**, right? You know **USDT**, right? Actually, the largest **parking space** for **USDT** is on **Tron**. This means **Tron** and **USDT** have a symbiotic relationship, at least previously. And think about it, **USDT** has printed so much currency, I forget if it's 60% or what percentage, I can check now, it's better to give real data to everyone. **Tron** currently has 4.7 **billion**, which is its **TVL**. **USDT** on **Tron** has 80 **billion**. What does this mean? It means its largest, **Ethereum**, is 46.77%, and the second is **Tron** at 43.07%. That's over eighty percent. And **USDT Tether**'s annual revenue is 15 billion US dollars, almost pure profit. Think about **OpenAI** losing tens of billions a year, **Anthropic** losing tens of billions a year; these two combined don't make as much as **Tether**'s revenue. The money you lose isn't as much as they earn.

</details>

**主持人**: **Tether**的收入是怎么来的？是这个交易费吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How does **Tether** generate its revenue? Is it from transaction fees?

</details>

**Chase**: 不是，**Tether**是**USDT**的发行方。它的背后的逻辑就是，比如说你给我1**dollar**，我拿这个**dollar**去买**T-bill**。买了**T-bill**之后，我再给你这个**USDT**这个**token**。那么对你来说，你就是1**dollar**换了一个**USDT**的**token**对吧，就是一美元对一美元。那么你就出去玩就好了。但对我来说，每进来了一美元，我就可以吃美联储给我的**T-bill**的利息。那么只要我的体量足够大，我就一直吃这个利差3.5%。就这个利息就是这么多现在目前。就这么多，一年150亿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: No, **Tether** is the issuer of **USDT**. The logic behind it is, for example, you give me 1 **dollar**, and I take that **dollar** to buy a **T-bill**. After buying the **T-bill**, I then give you this **USDT token**. So for you, you've exchanged 1 **dollar** for a **USDT token**, right? It's one dollar for one dollar. Then you can go and play. But for me, for every dollar that comes in, I can earn the interest from the **T-bill** that the Federal Reserve gives me. So, as long as my volume is large enough, I continuously profit from this interest rate spread of 3.5%. That's the current interest rate. That's it, 15 billion a year.

</details>

**主持人**: 好，哈哈。**孙割**真有钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay, haha. **Sun Ge** is really rich.

</details>

**Chase**: 真有钱。哈哈，我跟**孙割**不熟，八卦的事我可以给你一些链接，你可以去看看。这个公开场合讲人家不太好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Really rich. Haha, I'm not familiar with **Sun Ge**, I can give you some links for gossip, you can check them out. It's not good to talk about people in public.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，也确实。

### 币圈暴富与生态

**主持人**: 那要不讲讲这个币圈的暴富的这些故事吧，就是这是一群什么人？我们刚讲了，就是这个地方的本质或者说价值，然后讲了一些他的现在的样子，对吧，比如说大家不演的，他其实是个非常清晰的交易的这么一个场。我觉得他底层逻辑其实反而很清晰。那在这里边的这些人是一些什么样的人？我自己会看到就是所有的币圈聚会里边美女的比例特别的高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, how about we talk about the stories of getting rich quick in the crypto world? What kind of people are these? We just talked about the essence or value of this space, and its current state, right? For example, how transparent everyone is; it's actually a very clear trading arena. I think its underlying logic is quite clear. So, what kind of people are in this space? I personally observe that the proportion of beautiful women at all crypto gatherings is particularly high.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，就很神奇。应该是捞女的比例特别高，这个可以**verify**。当然也有很多好的女生，我的前同事里边一半多都是女生，她们都很优秀。币圈整个行业来说，其实就是一个单独的世界，一个单独的国家，它什么都有。这个整个**Spectrum**从最左端到最右端全部都有。你想最右端有美国总统，最高权力的人，他们家族的人在里边币圈里边搞好多事情。最左端有这些坐牢的人，坑了人家几十上百亿的人，什么样的人都有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, it's quite magical. The proportion of gold diggers is probably very high, that can be **verified**. Of course, there are also many good women; over half of my former colleagues were women, and they were all excellent. The crypto industry as a whole is essentially a separate world, a separate country; it has everything. The entire **spectrum**, from the far left to the far right, is present. On the far right, you have the US President, people with the highest power, their family members involved in many things within the crypto world. On the far left, you have people who are in jail, those who defrauded others of tens or hundreds of billions; all kinds of people exist.

</details>

**主持人**: 那我从我的角度，我自己是一个了解技术的人，然后也出过关于**Web3**的几期视频，了解一些。但是我觉得我是完全不在这个圈子里，除了买了一颗**比特币**以外，就跟这个圈子没有半毛钱关系。然后我会偶尔看到身边的有一些人说他们是在做**Web3**的，然后这里边就感觉赚钱的是少数，但似乎就是有的人在这里边是玩懂了这个游戏规则之后，他们似乎就可以极快地放大自己的财富，就所谓的暴富。这里边的从业者，你觉得玩懂这个游戏的比例大概有多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: From my perspective, I'm someone who understands technology, and I've produced several videos about **Web3**, so I know a bit. But I feel I'm completely outside this circle; apart from buying one **Bitcoin**, I have no connection to this space. And occasionally, I see people around me who say they're working in **Web3**, and it feels like a minority are making money, but it also seems that some, once they understand the rules of the game, can rapidly amplify their wealth, what's called getting rich quick. Among the professionals in this space, what percentage do you think truly understand the game?

</details>

**Chase**: 首先它门槛不高，你但凡是够勤奋，你一个高中生，不说在国内吧，在国内你懂科学上网的话，一个月挣个几万块钱人民币问题不大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: First, the barrier to entry isn't high. As long as you're diligent enough, even a high school student—not to mention domestically, but if you know how to bypass the Great Firewall in China—it's not hard to earn tens of thousands of RMB a month.

</details>

**主持人**: 通过什么方式？交易吗还是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Through what means? Trading? Or?

</details>

**Chase**: 通过去参与新的项目方，比如说空投这些东西对吧，它其实是流量变现的一个部分。就是因为这个行业它流动性足够多，或者是泡沫足够大，那么你花同样的时间去拿到的收益，就经济上的收益，一定是比你去做制造业，去做传统的第二产业要高的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: By participating in new projects, for example, through airdrops and such, right? That's actually a part of traffic monetization. It's because this industry has enough liquidity, or the bubble is big enough, that the economic returns you get for the same amount of time invested are definitely higher than if you were to work in manufacturing or traditional secondary industries.

</details>

**主持人**: 这就听起来就像是这里边的灵气非常的充沛，元婴修士们打架，或者说是在搞项目的时候，练气期过去，哎，求点丹药，哈哈哈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That sounds like the spiritual energy here is very abundant. When Nascent Soul cultivators are fighting, or working on projects, those in the Qi Condensation stage come by, "Hey, can I get some elixirs?" Hahaha.

</details>

**Chase**: 诶诶诶诶！差不多就这个意思。因为他没有那么卷，看起来好像有这么多钱，但人真的不多。**币安**现在有大概3个亿的用户了，注册用户，**KYC**过的加**KYB**的。但其实真的**active**的，我觉得这个行业的**active**的人可能也就100万不到，100万左右吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Hey, hey, hey! That's pretty much it. Because it's not that competitive; it seems like there's so much money, but there really aren't that many people. **Binance** now has about 300 million users, registered users, **KYC**'d and **KYB**'d. But in reality, the truly **active** people in this industry, I think, are probably less than 1 million, around 1 million.

</details>

**主持人**: 那除了去讨灵药还可以干嘛？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So besides begging for elixirs, what else can they do?

</details>

**Chase**: 讨灵药，然后还有很多很抽象的东西，比如说上个周期比较火的**NFT**对吧，其实就是小图片。但是就是以前我们所谓的荷兰郁金香的那个模式，它是有很多人玩。这里边就会形成很多人，比如说一夜暴富的。这些暴富的人，他们的钱就怎么来的，会怎么走，会变成什么样的情况呢？就是说所有的新来的人，你都很容易跟你这个认知差不多的人拿到同样的**average income**。只要你够勤奋，就算某人有一天会暴富了，可能有一天就如果不再改变，不再进步的话，不提高认知的话，他这个钱也会慢慢地去撒到圈内的其他人的手上。它是一个动态的**dynamic**的一个过程。因为你只要这个钱不花，它就一直是在那个地方。这是假的，对吧，不算钱。这也是为什么我说这个行业它可以**capture**很多多余的流动性，而不影响实体经济的这个通胀。钱都在那里，大家去玩吧，就欢乐豆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Begging for elixirs, and then there are many abstract things, like **NFTs** that were popular in the last cycle, right? They're essentially small pictures. But it's like the Dutch tulip mania model we used to talk about, many people play it. This leads to many people, for example, getting rich overnight. How does the money of these newly rich people come about, where does it go, and what happens to it? It means that all newcomers can easily earn the same **average income** as people with similar understanding. As long as you're diligent, even if someone gets rich overnight, if they don't change or improve, if they don't enhance their understanding, that money will slowly be distributed into the hands of others within the circle. It's a dynamic process. Because as long as you don't spend the money, it stays there. It's fake, right, it's not real money. This is also why I say this industry can **capture** a lot of excess liquidity without affecting inflation in the real economy. The money is all there, everyone can play, it's like fun tokens.

</details>

**主持人**: 其实和郁金香确实一件事。但是它花样多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's actually the same thing as tulips. But it has more variety.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，花样多。而且你每个人都可以做自己的郁金香，还是有平权的理念在里边的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, more variety. And everyone can create their own tulip, there's still the concept of equalization there.

</details>

**主持人**: 那元婴修士们在干嘛呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So what are the Nascent Soul cultivators doing?

</details>

**Chase**: 元婴修士们也分派别，分很多派别。有些是价值派的，像**Richard**这种，或者现金流派的，就我们老板这种，就是已经有很多钱了，他可能也不在乎这些现金流，反而是更在乎自己的行业地位。还有一些就是所谓的**Hacker Builder**，提供新的这个技术的，比如说**FHE**，**ZK**这些事情。这也是非常有意思的，哈哈哈，炼丹药的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Nascent Soul cultivators also have factions, many factions. Some are value-oriented, like **Richard**, or cash-flow oriented, like my boss, who already has a lot of money and probably doesn't care about cash flow, but rather cares more about his industry status. And then there are the so-called **Hacker Builders**, who provide new technologies, such as **FHE**, **ZK**, and these things. This is also very interesting, hahaha, alchemy.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且它很有用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And it's very useful.

</details>

**Chase**: 为什么？就是你没有**Crypto**的话，你像**ZK**或者**FHE**这两种技术，很难在现实世界有大规模的应用。第一它需要的**infra**很长时间的去投入，而且还不见得好。但是呢**Crypto**圈子里边，你只要是一个大家认可的，有**public good**或者是有**value**的东西，就可以被定价。这也是这个圈子里边有魅力的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Why? Because without **Crypto**, technologies like **ZK** or **FHE** would be very difficult to apply on a large scale in the real world. Firstly, they require long-term investment in **infra**, and it's not even guaranteed to be good. But in the **Crypto** circle, as long as something is recognized as a **public good** or has **value**, it can be priced. This is also what makes this circle so appealing.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得但是听起来就是赚大钱的人，还是那些搞交易操作市场的人，而不是这个做技术的人。尤其那些故事要成立，就是这里面最大的问题，就是这个故事非常的美，然后这个故事要成立，需要的技术投入其实非常非常大的。但是似乎……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think it sounds like the people who make big money are still those who engage in trading and market manipulation, not the technical people. Especially for those stories to hold true, the biggest problem here is that the story is very beautiful, and for this story to hold true, the technical investment required is actually very, very large. But it seems...

</details>

**Chase**: 对，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, that's right.

</details>

**主持人**: 很难激励这些真的有技术的人去投进来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's hard to incentivize truly technical people to invest here.

</details>

**Chase**: 有两个门槛。第一个可能钱不够多，第二个就是他离钱太近，反而又是个问题。比如说我觉得这些东西听起来很不错，我想去投入，但是我知道这里边面对的诱惑挑战，噪音和这个镰刀都是非常非常多的。我不觉得我在这里边就是能那么好的存活下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: There are two hurdles. The first is perhaps not enough money, and the second is that being too close to money becomes a problem. For example, I think these things sound great, and I want to invest, but I know there are so many temptations, challenges, noise, and scams here. I don't think I could survive that well in this environment.

</details>

**主持人**: 对，你讲出了大多数的人的心声其实。很多人想入圈或者想怎么样，肯定是有各种各样的风险的。因为它现在还是个偏草莽的时代，还没有完全正规化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes, you've really voiced what most people feel. Many who want to enter the space or do something there definitely face various risks. Because it's still a relatively wild era, not fully formalized yet.

</details>

**Chase**: 但是已经很快了吧。**币安**已经拿了这个阿布扎比那边的全球**license**，**compliance**这个东西会越来越进步的。对于个人来说，我觉得大家首先要摒弃自己的杂念，先去了解这个行业到底怎么回事，它到底是干什么，为什么会有这么多钱，为什么会有这么多人才进了这个行业。还是一个高人才密度，高资本密度的一个行业。你不了解，应该不是行业的问题，就是应该是你的问题。这也是我当时为什么说服自己花了8年时间，什么都不干，就专门去**diving**这个事情的原因。然后呢特别对年轻人非常友好，他不在乎你的身份地位，他只在乎你有没有付出，只在乎你有没有认真地去钻研去学习，你就可以赚到自己的这个生活费也好，就是一开始的一些收入，一定是比你去打工要好的，特别是应届生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: But it's moving fast, right? **Binance** has already obtained the global **license** from Abu Dhabi, and **compliance** will continue to improve. For individuals, I think everyone should first discard their preconceived notions and understand what this industry is all about, what it does, why there's so much money, and why so many talented people have entered this industry. It's still an industry with high talent density and high capital density. If you don't understand it, it's probably not the industry's problem; it's probably your problem. This is also why I convinced myself to spend 8 years doing nothing but **diving** into this. And it's particularly friendly to young people; it doesn't care about your status or position, it only cares if you've put in the effort, if you've seriously studied and researched. You can earn your living expenses, or initial income, which will definitely be better than working a regular job, especially for fresh graduates.

</details>

### 个人入场与投资建议

**主持人**: 最后再问你一个问题，就是对于我们频道的**typical**观众，就比如说一个技术行业的人来说，然后他可能也通过打工积累了一定财富，他想去在币圈里面赚钱的话，不要说什么参与建设币圈了，就想从币圈里边赚钱的话，2026年你对他们有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Finally, one more question for you: for the **typical** audience of our channel, say, someone in the tech industry who has accumulated some wealth through employment, if they want to make money in the crypto world—not even talking about participating in building it, just making money from it—what's your advice for them in 2026?

</details>

**Chase**: 我的建议就是，他至少先把币圈主流的两个事情先搞清楚。一个是**BTC**，当作资本配置，当作黄金也好或怎么样的也好，你先去打个底仓买一买可以试试。但这不是投资建议。第二个事情就是**稳定币**这个事情。**稳定币**这个事情几乎在今年，从前年我就团队内分享，就会有个大的爆发。去年几乎是肯定了这一波爆发，今年就会落实。这一波爆发，因为它几乎所有的银行体系，传统的旧的金融体系，都会被这个**稳定币**的支付所挑战到，无论是**C2C** / **B2B** / **B2C**都会有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: My advice is that they should at least first understand the two mainstream things in the crypto world. One is **BTC**, treat it as capital allocation, whether as gold or whatever, you can try buying a base position. But this is not investment advice. The second thing is **stablecoins**. The **stablecoin** phenomenon, I shared within the team since the year before last, would see a big explosion this year. Last year almost confirmed this wave of explosion, and it will materialize this year. This explosion is because almost all banking systems, the traditional old financial systems, will be challenged by **stablecoin** payments, whether it's **C2C** / **B2B** / **B2C**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的理解是**稳定币**它是一个很好的交易工具，但是它没有特别好的投资赚钱机会，是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: My understanding is that **stablecoins** are a good trading tool, but they don't offer particularly good investment opportunities for making money, is that correct?

</details>

**Chase**: 你要去看的话，当然可以去看美股，看**Circle**看**Robinhood**，看**Coinbase**这三个标的可以都去看一看。我觉得现在还是有被低估的。比如说，当然我不能讲名字了，哈哈，有被低估的。但是就是说，你自己得先去体会到这个东西为什么它会**challenge**到。因为你除了看多之外还可以看空，被**challenge**的那一方，如果他**react**不够快，你是不是还可以去空他，对吧？这里边有好多的基于一个**information**，一个固定趋势，你可以去**deploy**的一个策略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: If you want to look, of course, you can look at US stocks, look at **Circle**, look at **Robinhood**, look at **Coinbase**; you can check out all three of these. I think there are still some undervalued ones. For example, of course, I can't mention names, haha, there are undervalued ones. But the point is, you have to first understand why this thing will **challenge** existing systems. Because besides going long, you can also go short; if the challenged party doesn't **react** fast enough, can't you also short them, right? There are many strategies here that you can **deploy** based on information and a fixed trend.

</details>

**主持人**: 那我在这儿突然有个想法，就是我可以约你来**Superlinear**里边开一个这种付费的闭门分享，就是他不是投资建议，但是我觉得就你已经做了很多调研了对吧，然后这些东西应该是可以跟大家聊一下的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So I suddenly have an idea here: I could invite you to **Superlinear** to host a paid, private sharing session. It wouldn't be investment advice, but I think you've already done a lot of research, right? And these things should be discussable with everyone.

</details>

**Chase**: 当然当然，等我把**AI**的课补完，哈哈哈。**AI**课都没有来得及聊。唉，嘿嘿嘿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Of course, of course, after I finish catching up on my **AI** courses, hahaha. I haven't even had time to talk about **AI** courses yet. Ah, hehehe.

</details>

### AI学习心得与职业发展

**主持人**: 卖课的良机。你其实一直就有关注这个**AI**的课程，然后之前你其实工作特别忙，一天十几个小时，1,000多个项目吧，都是时间堆出来的，没有时间去看。但是你现在开始就是要退出了，就可以看这个课程，听说有一些体会，可不可以稍稍简单给大家讲一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A great opportunity to sell courses. You've actually always been interested in **AI** courses, and before, you were really busy with work, over ten hours a day, more than 1,000 projects, all built up over time, so you didn't have time to look. But now you're starting to exit, so you can watch these courses, and I hear you have some insights. Could you briefly share a little with everyone?

</details>

**Chase**: 这个课程对我而言，正好是现在**vibe coding**这个词出来之后，特别适合我的一种课程。对我来说，我可能不会去揪细节，我可能先什么？我先看框架，我先看什么东西不能用，什么东西不能做。比如说今天刚看**鸭哥**的视频，就是**API key**，你导入之后，你要放在那个**.env**里边，对不对？而不是被动地被上传。这些其实我觉得作为新手，非**engineer**，他是不知道的。这个应该是会要被强调出来，甚至一开始的一个**list**，**not to do list**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: For me, this course is exactly the kind of course that suits me, especially now that the term **vibe coding** has emerged. For me, I probably won't get bogged down in details. What do I do first? I look at the framework, I look at what shouldn't be used, what shouldn't be done. For example, I just watched **Yage**'s video today, about **API keys**: after you import them, you need to put them in the **.env** file, right? Instead of passively uploading them. I think as a beginner, a non-**engineer**, one wouldn't know these things. This should be emphasized, perhaps even an initial **list**, a **not to do list**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我跟**鸭哥**说一下这个**list**，总结一下。诶，**AI**时代编程基础那门课你看了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'll tell **Yage** about this **list**, summarize it. Hey, have you watched the "Programming Fundamentals in the **AI** Era" course?

</details>

**Chase**: 看完了，应该是那个很有用。因为我那天回你消息的时候，我其实正好把那门课看了一半，然后正好部署了我自己在**local**里**host**那个**agent**，然后去帮我去查这些交易的这些数据，乱七八糟的。就存在手机上，就让他就是跟我去**call**不同的**API**去给我查。这个东西对我来说也是很有用的。将来我们可能还可以单独做一个**MCP**，去**you know**做**Crypto**方向的这个**API**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: I finished it, that one should be very useful. Because when I replied to you that day, I was actually halfway through that course, and I had just deployed my own **agent** **hosted** **locally**, and it was helping me look up all sorts of transaction data and miscellaneous stuff. I just kept it on my phone and had it **call** different **APIs** to look things up for me. This thing is also very useful for me. In the future, we might even be able to create a separate **MCP** to, **you know**, build **Crypto**-oriented **APIs**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得这些课程对你来说一个很大的作用，就是教的那些具体的点它是有用的，**mindset**，然后**habit**这些东西都是有用的。但是我觉得可能一个很独特价值的地方，就是因为**鸭哥**足够的懂，有足够深的第一性原理的思考，所以说他敢说哪些东西没有用了，他敢说什么样的学习方法是错的。很多人不敢说这句话，因为他们就怕说错了，然后因为他们对这个想法不够自信。**鸭哥**是完全想清楚了这个为什么是之前是这样的，现在是那样的。比如说他就可以讲用**framework**学习**AI**是错的。大多数人是不敢讲这句话的，大多数人只敢和稀泥。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think a big benefit of these courses for you is that the specific points taught are useful, the **mindset**, and the **habits** are all useful. But I think a very unique value might be that because **Yage** understands deeply enough, with sufficiently profound first-principles thinking, he dares to say what is no longer useful, and he dares to say what kind of learning methods are wrong. Many people don't dare to say this because they're afraid of being wrong, and because they're not confident enough in their ideas. **Yage** has completely thought through why things were one way before and are another way now. For example, he can say that learning **AI** with a **framework** is wrong. Most people wouldn't dare to say that; most people would just equivocate.

</details>

**Chase**: 你可能要内行10年功的人才能感知得到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: You probably need someone with 10 years of insider experience to perceive that.

</details>

**主持人**: 对我来说，**鸭哥**就是带我走了一遍，但是很多他带我走的时候，有很多细节是我自己去玩，自己去摸索，不知道踩多少坑的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: For me, **Yage** just walked me through it, but many details he guided me through were things I had to play with and explore myself, not knowing how many pitfalls I'd encounter.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我为什么说这个，就是因为我今天才写了一个文章在社区里边，然后有一个人就说网上有这么多免费资料，为什么要这么贵的课程？我说这个课程比起给你省的那个坑，帮你省一天的时间，这个钱就出来了。就网上的你学习10分钟，然后浪费一天，基本上是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The reason I'm saying this is because I just wrote an article in the community today, and someone said, "There's so much free information online, why is this course so expensive?" I said, compared to the pitfalls it helps you avoid, and the day it saves you, the money is well worth it. Online, you learn for 10 minutes and then waste a day; that's basically how it is.

</details>

**Chase**: 网上的……九牛一毛。你看你们俩出的课，我第一时间先买，买完之后有空我再来看，从来没有犹豫过。为什么？因为我知道很便宜，几百块钱美元，特别是对币圈的人来说，几百块钱就跟没有一样。那几百块就能帮我打开一个新的领域的，最直接的认知，以最高效的方式去了解它。这个对做投资的人，特别是对我这种**mindset**的人来说，是非常非常高效的。这也是你的价值，我非常认可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Online... it's a drop in the ocean. When you two release courses, I buy them immediately. After buying, I'll watch them when I have time, never hesitating. Why? Because I know it's very cheap, a few hundred US dollars, especially for people in the crypto world, a few hundred dollars is like nothing. And those few hundred dollars can open up the most direct understanding of a new field for me, allowing me to learn about it in the most efficient way. For investors, especially for someone with my **mindset**, this is extremely efficient. This is also your value, and I highly recognize it.

</details>

**主持人**: 谢谢谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Thank you, thank you.

</details>

### 个人价值最大化与未来规划

**主持人**: 那我们回答你的问题吧。就你觉得我应该怎么样去最大化地利用我的这个**domain knowledge**？就是你这个人的综合价值来说，在你有实权的时候，实权和你的**domain knowledge**大概几比几？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So let's answer your question. How do you think I should maximize the use of my **domain knowledge**? In terms of your overall value as a person, when you had real power, what was the ratio of power to your **domain knowledge**?

</details>

**Chase**: 2:8，就是实权是2。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: 2:8, meaning power was 2.

</details>

**主持人**: 在别人眼中呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And in others' eyes?

</details>

**Chase**: 别人眼中可能倒过来，在别人眼中我觉得可能是99:1。也有可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: In others' eyes, it might be reversed; in others' eyes, I think it might be 99:1. It's possible.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得得先想想这件事。这很正常嘛，就是在任何一个大厂里边的**VP**这种级别，动辄是吧，然后一出来就发现自己**nobody cares**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think we need to consider this first. It's normal, right? A **VP**-level person in any big tech company, casually, right? And then once they leave, they find that **nobody cares**.

</details>

**Chase**: 我说实话，我一直是空杯的心态。你想我从投资跳到**Crypto**也是这样的，我的第一个**job**也就是一个非常基础的**entry level**的**job**。所以这个我不**care**。我**care**的是首先我的**vision**，我的价值要被体现出来。我这个价值，这些**data**已经被**input**到我这个模型里了，我想把它输出出来。但是第一得有人问正确的问题，第二我得有一个合适的平台去让大家去理解。那你想的所谓的最大化**leverage**的那个**outcome**是什么？是金钱的收入，还是影响力，还是什么？其实和第二个问题也是一样的，我们可以一块问，就是你第二个问题是做**IP**和**cash-rich business**如何**prioritize**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Honestly, I've always had an empty-cup mentality. You know, when I transitioned from investment to **Crypto**, it was the same; my first **job** was a very basic, **entry-level job**. So I don't **care** about that. What I **care** about is, first, my **vision**, my value needs to be realized. This value, this **data**, has been **input** into my model, and I want to output it. But first, someone needs to ask the right questions, and second, I need a suitable platform for people to understand. So, what is the **outcome** you envision for maximizing **leverage**? Is it monetary income, influence, or something else? It's actually the same as the second question, we can ask them together: your second question is how to **prioritize** between building an **IP** and a **cash-rich business**?

</details>

**主持人**: 大多数人是没有钱也没有影响力，所以说你既然还在这里选，是你有足够的钱了吗已经？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Most people have neither money nor influence, so since you're still choosing here, do you already have enough money?

</details>

**Chase**: 不能说足够，但是我不会特别担心就是家里或者孩子这些事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Not enough, but I'm not particularly worried about family or children.

</details>

**主持人**: 那你想最大化**leverage**的**outcome**是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So what is the **outcome** you want to maximize **leverage** for?

</details>

**Chase**: 我的一个**vision**就是，我觉得这个行业还有20-30年，我希望我就是一直在吃行业的**Beta**，偶尔会有一些**Alpha**出来。这是我的一个目标。钱吗？就行业增长，**in general**就名跟利在我这边是一回事，你有名自然会有利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: My **vision** is that I believe this industry still has 20-30 years, and I hope to continuously benefit from the industry's **Beta**, with occasional **Alpha** emerging. This is my goal. Money? Just industry growth, **in general**, fame and fortune are one and the same for me; if you have fame, profit will naturally follow.

</details>

**主持人**: 你的情况非常特殊了。我先说一个我会对一个不是这样的情况的一个相对**generic**的建议，然后我再看看能不能**customize**一些。**Generic**的建议是，我觉得就创业的第一步，做知识付费是非常合理的。因为他非标高客单价，然后你现在再去做一个就是标准品的话，他没有办法**justify**你的时间投入的。因为你做的标准品的利润率是非常低的。而且你本身就有这么多知识，市面上对这个知识有这么多的需求。所以说我觉得这是一个合理的路径。如果你感兴趣的话，咱们也可以商量一下，就是有没有办法帮你做一下。关键是在于你积累一个基础的业务吧，我觉得和基础的收入，然后你看看在这个上面能不能再换筹码，大概是这么一套。然后另外，我觉得你在这个里边构建自己的资产非常的重要，然后这个资产应该最好是一个能**generate cash**的资产。举个例子，其实这个社区不就是这样一个资产嘛。然后你在币圈，我对币圈不够了解，所以说我不知道有什么样的资产。听起来发一个这种项目有可能，或者说是怎么样。

<details>

**主持人**: Your situation is very unique. I'll first offer a relatively **generic** piece of advice for a situation that isn't like yours, and then I'll see if I can **customize** some. The **generic** advice is that I think the first step in entrepreneurship, doing knowledge-based paid content, is very reasonable. Because it's non-standardized with a high customer unit price, and if you were to create a standardized product now, it wouldn't be able to **justify** your time investment. The profit margin for standardized products is very low. And you already possess so much knowledge, and there's so much demand for this knowledge in the market. So I think this is a reasonable path. If you're interested, we can discuss whether there's a way to help you with it. The key is to build a foundational business, I think, and foundational income, and then see if you can leverage that for more. That's roughly the approach. And additionally, I think it's very important for you to build your own assets in this space, and this asset should ideally be one that can **generate cash**. For example, this community itself is such an asset, isn't it? And in the crypto world, I don't know enough about it, so I don't know what kind of assets there are. It sounds like launching such a project is possible, or something similar.

**Chase**: 你要进币圈，我能带你玩的飞起，哈哈哈。但就现在这个条件，对你的**reputation**不好。但是币圈等他快要到成熟期的时候，这个时候你去**cash out**是最好的。

**Chase**: If you want to enter the crypto world, I can show you a wild time, hahaha. But under current conditions, it wouldn't be good for your **reputation**. However, when the crypto world is nearing its mature phase, that's the best time for you to **cash out**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我不觉得我的**reputation**那么重要。就是昨天我还在一个雪圈里边说大家去滑雪，然后下面说诶，活捉一个**YouTube**大神，我说别叫我**YouTube**大神，叫我卖课小妖。但是确实这不是我现在的**focus**，我现在还是**focus**把那个课程做好。所以说这个东西可以下半年的时候我再去想和讨论和谈。**Anyway**，你得构建一个属于自己的**asset**，然后这个**asset**你想**capture**它的行业增长，那这个**asset**肯定是要能顺着行业增长去增值的。我就不知道这里边到底什么样的资产是最合适的了。但是我觉得你肯定是可以有更好的想法。我自己的感觉就是普通世界5年去构建出来这么一个**asset**已经很不容易了。币圈可能更快一点，以及你已经开始做你的这个**agent**和有**AI**的加成，然后你又有这个知识的加成。然后我的建议是尽量找一个合作方。你在行业的人脉这么大是吧，大家对你的信任度这么高。大多数人应该是看你的实权的，但是应该有人是认可你本人的。

**主持人**: I don't think my **reputation** is that important. Just yesterday, I was in a ski group talking about going skiing, and someone below said, "Hey, caught a **YouTube** god!" I said, "Don't call me a **YouTube** god, call me a course-selling imp." But indeed, that's not my current **focus**; I'm still **focused** on making that course good. So, this is something I can think about, discuss, and talk about in the second half of the year. **Anyway**, you need to build your own **asset**, and if you want to **capture** its industry growth, then this **asset** must be able to appreciate along with industry growth. I just don't know what kind of asset is most suitable here. But I think you definitely can have better ideas. My own feeling is that it's already very difficult to build such an **asset** in the ordinary world in 5 years. The crypto world might be faster, and you've already started working on your **agent** with the **AI** bonus, and you also have the knowledge bonus. My advice is to try to find a partner. You have such extensive industry connections, right? People trust you so much. Most people probably look at your actual power, but some should recognize you personally.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，你说的很对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, you're absolutely right.

</details>

**主持人**: 然后在这里边找一个不管是大哥抱上，就是大哥分你一块业务，或者说分你一个新项目，给你一定的资源和这个背书让你去做，还是找一个和你类似的，但是跟你有互补的**partner**去做，我觉得都可以帮助你更快地建立一个就是更有影响力的**asset**。然后你的那个**vision**，为什么这是我犹豫的地方，我觉得你的那个**vision**是特别吸引人的一个**vision**，但是他就容易走进一个纯影响力路线，这可能不是你想要的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then, within this, find someone, whether it's a big shot who gives you a piece of business, or a new project, providing you with certain resources and endorsement to do it, or find a **partner** similar to you but complementary, I think either can help you build a more influential **asset** faster. And your **vision**—this is why I hesitate—I think your **vision** is very appealing, but it easily leads to a purely influence-driven path, which might not be what you want.

</details>

**Chase**: 明白。纯影响力路线其实非常难构建。影响力这个东西，它贬值的很快。所以说你今天发了一个东西，最好的结果就是大家转发，然后大家觉得你说的好棒。过了3个月之后呢，就是你如果不能把它落地的话，这个东西有什么用呢？就是还是需要**CZ**这样的大哥是吧，号召行业，然后去说我们这个东西，我们要把它落地成行业标准，然后我要去推动实际的元婴修士级别的这种合作，然后他才有可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Understood. A purely influence-driven path is actually very difficult to build. Influence is something that depreciates very quickly. So, if you post something today, the best outcome is that everyone shares it and thinks what you said is great. But after 3 months, if you can't implement it, what's the use of it? It still requires a big shot like **CZ**, right, to rally the industry, and say, "This thing we have, we need to make it an industry standard, and I'm going to push for actual Nascent Soul cultivator-level collaborations," and only then is it possible.

</details>

**主持人**: 那都是化神级了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's at the God Transformation stage.

</details>

**Chase**: 元婴修士的联盟应该也可以吧。但是个人可能很难做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: A Nascent Soul cultivator alliance should also work, right? But it might be difficult for an individual to achieve.

</details>

**主持人**: 你讲的很对。你给我这两点建议，其实都是我去卜卦，卜出来的也就是这两点。要不我找一个非常好的平台，要么我找一个很好的**partner**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're absolutely right. The two pieces of advice you gave me are actually the same two points I divined. Either I find a very good platform, or I find a very good **partner**.

</details>

**Chase**: 对，这个就看自己性格了。我觉得找平台肯定是一个特别好的方法其实。因为**partner**你永远可以找，平台这种东西它的机会是很难抓的其实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: Yes, that depends on your personality. I think finding a platform is definitely a very good approach, actually. Because you can always find a **partner**, but opportunities for platforms are actually very hard to seize.

</details>

**主持人**: 看缘分了。这个圈子里边哪有还有比**币安**更大的平台对吧？就是有个职位嘛。你从**币安**的这个职位跳到了一个地方，干另外一件事儿。就平台的大小和你在里边的角色都很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It depends on fate. In this circle, is there any platform bigger than **Binance**, right? It's about having a position. You jumped from your position at **Binance** to somewhere else to do something different. Both the size of the platform and your role within it are important.

</details>

**Chase**: 在这个行业的这个公司，就职位上来说是到顶了。但是他不是你想干的事嘛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: In this company, in this industry, in terms of position, I've reached the top. But it's not what you want to do, right?

</details>

**主持人**: **Yeah**，就是你的名利各方面的，尤其这个实权**power**来说是到顶了。但是他不能实现你的理想，这个**power**没有办法转化成你的理想。我的意思是说一个相信你的人，相信你的平台，给你对应的资源，然后你去实现理想。然后这个实现理想肯定不是一步到位的。在我看来，他是得你去做一个就是拿得出手的项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **Yeah**, in terms of your fame, fortune, and especially the actual **power**, you've reached the peak. But it can't fulfill your ideals; this **power** can't be transformed into your ideals. My point is, someone who believes in you, a platform that believes in you, gives you the corresponding resources, and then you go achieve your ideals. And achieving those ideals certainly isn't a one-step process. In my opinion, you have to undertake a project that's truly impressive.

</details>

**Chase**: 我自己肯定是要每天的去卷的，这个已经养成习惯了。我们可以再约个时间到时候再聊别的话题都可以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chase**: I definitely have to work hard every day; that's already a habit. We can schedule another time to discuss other topics.

</details>

**主持人**: 好呀好呀。今天这个内容非常感谢，哈哈哈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay, okay. Thank you very much for today's content, hahaha.

</details>

**Chase**: 没关系没关系。感谢你，感谢你。

**Chase**: No problem, no problem. Thank you, thank you.
