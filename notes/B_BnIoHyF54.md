### 劳动力市场软化与潜在降息

近期数据显示，美国劳动力市场正在降温。Challenger报告显示，企业裁员意图显著增加，达到多年来的高位。同时，JOLTS报告显示职位空缺数量意外下降，职位空缺与求职人数的比例也降至疫情前水平。这些数据表明，劳动力市场的降温可能预示着通胀压力将得到缓解，从而促使美联储提前降息。事实上，在最近一次会议上，美联储官员Waller就曾提出降息的可能性，认为劳动力市场存在下行风险。虽然非农就业报告因政府停摆而推迟发布，但目前的趋势已经非常明确。

Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 February
 7th

and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past

week
 was
 a
 volatile
 week
 in
 markets.
 The

week
 before
 we
 had
 volatility
 in
 the

precious
 metals.
 This
 week
 it
 was
 in
 the

major
 indexes.
 Looking
 at
 the
 S&P
 500,

we
 briefly
 broke
 below
 the
 100-day

moving
 average.
 However,
 we
 did
 have
 a

monster
 rally
 on
 Friday
 and
 that
 took
 us

right
 back
 above
 the
 50-day
 moving

average,
 which
 many
 market
 participants

perceive
 to
 be
 indicative
 of
 an
 ongoing

uptrend.
 However,
 zooming
 out,
 when
 I

look
 at
 this,
 it
 seems
 really
 obvious

that
 we've
 gone
 nowhere
 for
 months
 and

continue
 to
 lose
 momentum.
 So,
 it
 does

not
 look
 good
 to
 me.
 So,
 today,
 let's

talk
 about
 three
 things.
 First
 off,
 we

have
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 labor
 market

where
 it
 seems
 like
 we're
 getting
 worse

labor
 market
 data,
 and
 that's
 uh

suggestive
 of
 more
 cuts
 than
 what's

currently
 priced
 into
 the
 market.

### 科技股动荡：AI投资与商业模式挑战

近期科技股面临较大压力，部分原因是亚马逊的财报以及Anthropic推出的一款新型AI模型。亚马逊宣布今年将投资2000亿美元用于AI，但市场反应负面，股价下跌10%。尽管其他科技公司如Meta也积极投资AI，但市场对AI投资的回报存在疑虑。一方面，巨额AI投资意味着公司可用于回购股票的现金减少，另一方面，AI技术的盈利能力仍存在不确定性。此外，Anthropic的新型AI模型能够轻松生成定制化软件，对软件即服务（SaaS）公司的传统商业模式构成挑战，导致Salesforce和Adobe等公司股价下跌。

Secondly,
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about

the
 carnage
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 It

seems
 to
 be
 largely
 driven
 by
 tech,
 in

part
 due
 to
 uh
 Amazon
 earnings,
 in
 part

due
 to
 a
 new
 AI
 model
 from
 Anthropic

that
 is
 challenging
 the
 business
 models

of
 software
 as
 a
 service
 companies.
 And

lastly,
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit

about
 crypto.
 We
 had
 tremendous

volatility
 in
 Bitcoin
 down
 to
 60,000,

but
 of
 course
 rebounded
 by
 $10,000
 on

Friday.
 It
 seems
 like
 we
 may
 be
 heading

into
 a
 crypto
 winter.
 All
 right,

starting
 with
 the
 labor
 market.

### 加密货币危机：信心缺失与潜在寒冬

比特币近期经历了剧烈波动，一度跌至60,000美元，随后在周五反弹至70,000美元以上。然而，比特币已经失去了此前因特朗普政府政策推动而获得的所有涨幅。尽管特朗普政府对加密货币持积极态度，并采取了一系列支持措施，但市场信心正在减弱。此外，比特币未能受益于通胀上升，而黄金等传统避险资产却表现强劲，这进一步加剧了市场对加密货币的担忧。技术面分析也显示，比特币已经跌破200日移动平均线，趋势不明朗。整体来看，加密货币市场可能正面临一场寒冬。
