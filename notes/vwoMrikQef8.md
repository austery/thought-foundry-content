title: 巴菲特大举买入谷歌，英伟达财报来袭，市场年底行情将走向何方？
---
### 市场回顾与展望：在震荡中迎接英伟达财报

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场前瞻。我们即将进入十一月的第三周，过去两周的股票市场显然相当动荡。目前**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500 Index: 追踪在美国证券交易所上市的500家大公司股票表现的股票市场指数）的点位在672，基本上和两周前持平，但期间的走势堪称疯狂。

<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market futures. Thank you everybody for being here. I'm sorry I'm late in those last two minutes before you go live. Something always happens, but we're here. We're live. Thank everyone for being here. We got a lot to talk about, folks. We are entering into the third week of November for the equity markets, and the past two weeks have obviously been pretty choppy, I guess, is one word to describe it. We're at basically where we were two weeks ago on the S&P 500 at 672. The way we got there over the past couple of weeks was kind of crazy.</p>
</details>

上周五的盘前市场尤为疯狂，一些股票的价格甚至回到了四月份的水平。开盘后，先是多头在9点30分进场，随后市场情绪又转向悲观，最终收盘时略微上涨。上周的走势与此类似，十月份也同样动荡。这种震荡行情延续到了十一月，已经成为一种趋势。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean in pre-markets on Friday it was just I mean there were there were some stocks that were getting back to April liberation day levels and it was just kind of crazy and then you had the bulls come in at 9:30 then you had a little bit more bearishness in day then we ended out kind of green kind of had the same story last week obviously we had a pretty choppy October as well so the continuation of that chop into November has been a trend.</p>
</details>

本周将至关重要，因为我们将迎来英伟达的财报。考虑到我们正接近年底，而英伟达是全球最重要的公司，这无疑是全年最重大的事件之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this week is going to be very important because this week we've got Nvidia earnings which is going to be you know just one of the biggest events of the entire year given we're getting into the end of the year and Nvidia is the most important company in the world.</p>
</details>

目前股指期货已经转绿。就在几分钟前，我还在推特上发截图说期货市场平淡，这已经算不错了，因为加密货币市场在周末经历了暴跌。我当时想，如果期货能保持平稳，那也不是什么大事。但就在我发帖三分钟后，市场就转绿了。我不知道发生了什么，没看到任何重大新闻，但市场确实反转了。加密货币市场虽然没有翻红，但也试图形成一根上涨的绿色蜡烛图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to put the green or red poll for tomorrow in the chat. Futures are already green. They actually flipped green. I posted a screenshot on Twitter like four minutes ago and it was flat and I was like, "Oh, okay. Futures are flat. That's good enough because we'll talk about crypto. Crypto has been imploding over the weekend." So, I was like, "You know what? The fact that we have some flat futures, this is what I posted a couple of minutes ago." I was like, "We can we can we can handle this. If futures are going to be flat, that's not that big of a deal. And then literally three minutes after I posted, we go green. I don't know what happened. I don't know if there was a headline. I mean, I didn't see any crazy headline, but they flipped. Crypto kind of I mean, crypto is not green, but it's trying to develop a little bit of a green candle higher. And we'll talk about some of the stuff that could be going on with crypto.</p>
</details>

期货转绿是个好现象。本周之所以重要，是因为过去两周的来回拉锯非常难看。所以，本周的关键在于观察我们是否能在这片动荡中开始筑底。汤姆·李（Tom Lee）几周前曾预测十一月的前两周会很动荡，事实也确实如此。现在我们进入了十一月的下半月，感恩节也快到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, we got futures that are green, which is really nice to see. So this week is going to be really important because the past two weeks have been ugly just in terms of the choppiness back and forth. And so you know this week's going to be important to see can we start developing a bit of a bottom around that choppiness. Tom Lee has you know kind of predicted a couple weeks ago that the first two weeks of November would be choppy and that's kind of what we're getting. And so this is the latter half of November right before Thanksgiving. You know we got a bunch of holidays coming up.</p>
</details>

根据 Fundstrat 今天早上的报告，比特币在92,909美元触底后正试图反弹至92美元以上。以太坊则跌至3003美元，离跌破3000美元仅差3美元，但最终守住了，目前价格在3100美元。汤姆·李的论点是，他坚信基金经理们在年底的追逐行情将推动标普500指数上涨5%，达到7000点的水平。我们将对此进行分析，看看这一预测是否会实现，但无论如何，这都是我们需要关注的最重要的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And based on Fund Strap's note this morning, which we're going to take a look at, Bitcoin right there trying to get a little bit of a bounce off 92. It did hit 92,909. Ethereum hit 3003, was $3 away from going below 3,000, but did not get to those levels, 3100 right now on Ethereum. His argument is that he really does believe this end ofear chase for fund managers is going to take the S&P 5% higher, which would bring us to that 7,000 level. So, we'll do some analysis and see if that ends up playing out, but nonetheless, that's going to be one of the most important things that we have to take a look at.</p>
</details>

### 核心争论：我们是否处于 AI 泡沫之中？

除此之外，我们长期讨论的经济分化论也有很多新动向。周末我研究了许多关于两种不同经济体和消费者健康状况的数据点。纽约大学的阿斯沃斯·达摩达兰（Ashwath Damodaran）教授在 ProfG 播客上发表了看法，那期播客获得了大约20万的观看量，他基本上把所有人都吓坏了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, you got a lot of stuff going on in the I guess bifurcation of economy argument that we've been talking about for a long time. There's a lot of different things and data points that I've been looking at over the weekend around this idea of two different economies and the health of the consumer. you had the professor from from Ashwath or from NYU Ashwath Delmodorian. The dude went on the the ProfG G podcast. His podcast got like 200,000 views and I think he basically scared the [ __ ] out of everybody.</p>
</details>

我昨天开车回家时听了那期一个小时的节目，他全程都在表达悲观情绪，声称我们绝对处于一个人工智能泡沫中。问题不在于我们是否处于泡沫中，而在于这个泡沫有多严重，以及它何时会破裂、破裂到何种程度。他甚至建议将部分资金投入收藏品，还提到了宝可梦卡牌。我告诉史蒂夫，他简直不敢相信。这并不是说他本人在投资宝可梦卡牌，而是他认为，鉴于人工智能交易已经过度曝光，这是一种值得关注的另类资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it is an hour. I was listening it to it on the ride home yesterday in in in my car and he was I was just I was just listening to it as I was as the as I was driving and just it's just constant bearishness from this guy saying we are absolutely in an AI bubble. It was not a question of if we're in a bubble, it's a question of how aggressive the bubble is and if the bubble is going to pop. or not if it's going to pop, when it's going to pop, and to what extent it's going to pop. I mean, the guy recommended taking some of your money and putting it into collectibles. He even mentioned Pokemon cards. I told Steve about that. Steve couldn't believe it. Not saying that he is investing in Pokemon cards, but he mentioned that's an alternative asset to be curious of given the AI trade is so overexposed.</p>
</details>

我认为对此存在两种不同的观点。你要么相信他的说法，因此对人工智能股票感到恐惧，认为2026年对纳斯达克来说会是糟糕的一年；要么你认为这不真实，觉得谷歌以27倍市盈率交易并非泡沫，即使市场上其他一些部分可能感觉像泡沫。我们将探讨这些论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean, again, I I just think there's two different perspectives on this. either you believe that's the case and as a result you're kind of you know more scared of the AI stocks and 20 um 26 is going to be bad for the NASDAQ or you think that's not real and you think that you know the Google trading at 27 times earnings is not a bubble even if some other parts of the market might feel like they're in a bubble. So we'll explore those arguments tried to do a bit of a research this week on those or this weekend and uh we'll kind of analyze what happened.</p>
</details>

此外，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）与罗恩·巴伦（Ron Baron）进行了一场主题演讲，谈到了人工智能领域的许多不同事情。埃隆和桑达尔（Sundar Pichai）在推特上进行了互动，他们说的一些话我认为相对乐观。我们也会关注这一点。然后，我还会展示一些宏观图表，以揭示我们在为2026年做准备时所面临的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Elon also gave a keynote with Ron Baron and he talked about a bunch of different things in the world of AI. Uh Elon and Sunund went back and forth on Twitter and they said some things that I thought were relatively bullish. So, we're going to look at that. And then we have a bunch of macro charts that I want to pull up to also kind of show what we've got going on as we prepare for for 2026.</p>
</details>

达摩达兰确实卖掉了他持有的很多英伟达股票。大约一年半前，当英伟达股价还未拆分时，他就说英伟达被高估了。自那时起，英伟达的股价可能已经上涨了大约1.7到3倍。他一直在大声疾呼估值过高，但显然，股票并没有因为这种论调而下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As did sell a lot of his Nvidia. I mean he technically he said Nvidia was overvalued back when what Nvidia was trading at I can't I forgot the pre-split price but it was about a year and a half ago and I think Nvidia has done like a 3x since then maybe like a 1.7x roundabout I got to calculate the numbers but you know he's been screaming overvaluation for a while obviously stocks have not necessarily uh fa you know faulted in this kind of overvaluation argument.</p>
</details>

但我认为，整体市场情绪正开始变得更加恐惧。我在X平台上发起了一项有9000人投票的民意调查，问题是：“你对2026年的市场持何种看法？看涨、看跌还是平盘？”结果显示，41%的人看涨，但27%的人看跌，32%的人认为会平盘。如果2025年我们能获得20%的回报率（目前是14%，还差6%），那将是连续第三年实现这样的增长。如果2026年再来一个牛市，那将是连续四年实现20%的涨幅，这并非不可能，只是很难想象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think the sentiment in general is starting to become more a fear I put out this poll as as well that got 9,000 votes on X. And the question was, hey, what do you think for 2026? Bullish, bearish, or flat. 41% of people said bull uh bullish, but 27% of people said bearish, and 32% of people say flat. If we were to have a 20% uh 2025 return, we're at 14% right now, so we got 6% to go. That would be three years back to back to back. If we have another 2026 bull run, that would be four years in a row of 20% gains, which is not impossible. It's just hard to see.</p>
</details>

但问题是，在这次声势浩大的牛市中，我们是否会遭遇熊市？这种情况在1998年、1999年发生过，市场最终在2000年见顶前回升。这是否可能再次发生？我认为很大程度上将取决于我们获得的数据以及宏观经济格局。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but then again, do we get a bare market in the midst of this prolific bull run? I mean, it happened during that 1998, 1999 time. It ended up recovering until it topped out in 2000. But um is that possible? I think a lot of it is going to have to do with the data that we get and obviously the macroeconomic landscape.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济的烦恼：美联储、消费者债务与“可负担性”叙事

在谈到上周五发生的激动人心的事件之前，最重要的一点是关于美联储的数据。美联储降息的概率已经降至50%以下，目前为45.8%，这确实令人烦恼。从我看到的所有数据来看，我们真的需要降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the biggest thing to mention before we get into the thing that happened on Friday that I think was very excited for a lot of people or very exciting for a lot of people is uh this data around the Fed. I mean, the Fed probabilities for a rate cut went down below 50%, which is just really annoying. Right now, it's at 45.8%. Everything that I've looked at, and I'm not the greatest economist in the world, but everything that I've looked at is telling me we really need to cut rates.</p>
</details>

如果我们看看次级汽车贷款违约率、信用卡违约率和裁员报告，就会发现，认为我们可以维持利率不变的想法表明美联储简直是疯了。今晚我们将深入探讨这些数据。接下来会发生什么将非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the idea that we would leave rates unchanged, if you look at subprime auto delinquencies, credit card delinquencies, layoff reports, and we're going to look a lot of a lot of this a lot of that stuff tonight, it signals that the Fed has absolutely lost their mind thinking that we can leave rates on like like legitimately lost their freaking mind. And it's going to be very interesting to see what happens.</p>
</details>

要让降息概率回到几周前的80%，我们需要在11月21日左右看到一份相当糟糕的劳动力报告。我认为那份报告将向美联储发出明确的降息信号，但这也是我们所有人都必须密切关注的事情，以判断利率的最终走向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the way this probability goes back up to 80% like it was a couple weeks ago is if we get a pretty bad labor report on I think what is it, November 21st. It's in about five days we're going to get that labor report and I think that's, you know, going to be pretty obvious to the Fed to cut rates, but that's going to be one of the things that we all are going to have to keep our eyes out on to see what's going to end up happening with rates.</p>
</details>

### 本周最大新闻：伯克希尔为何押注谷歌？

上周五最大的新闻是，伯克希尔哈撒韦公司购买了1800万股谷歌股票。这里有很多值得讨论的地方。有人说他们的预估买入价是243美元，这个数据来自一个只显示报告价格的网站，但这些网站都没有实际的成交价。如果用1780万股乘以当前股价，这笔投资的价值约为50亿美元。我不认为他的平均成本是243美元，可能稍低，也可能稍高，但只有等我们拿到伯克希尔的实际文件才能确切知道他们的买入价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, the biggest story of Friday, we got six minutes until the overnight markets open was Birkshshire bought 18 million shares of the Goos. Lot to talk about here. Would love to know what people are thinking on this. Uh people are saying their estimated price is 243. They're getting that from a website that's just showing the reported price. None of those websites actually have the actual price. It is a $5 billion stake if you multiply 17.8 million times the current share price. I don't think his average is 243. It might be it might be a little bit lower, might be a little bit higher, but once we get the actual filings from Birkshshire, we'll be able to know exactly what price they paid.</p>
</details>

目前我们只知道他们在第三季度，也就是七月、八月和九月的某个时间点买入了谷歌。这相当疯狂，因为巴菲特和伯克希尔的投资哲学是除了苹果之外，不碰科技公司。但他们这次却投资了谷歌，我认为这非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As of now, all we know is that sometime in Q3, so August and September and July, they bought Google, which is pretty crazy because Buffett and Birkshshire, the philosophy of their firm is not to touch technology companies outside of Apple, but they touched Google, which I think is very exciting.</p>
</details>

这里有一段巴菲特八年前的视频，他解释了为什么购买苹果。我们可以试着比较一下，看看这对于理解伯克希尔现在购买谷歌有何启示。他提到苹果股票曾经历繁荣与萧条的周期，每次发布新手机都会推高股价，没有新品发布时股价就会下跌。他认为，虽然手机业务仍占65%，但很多人看待它的方式不同了。他关注的是数亿用户几乎把生活都建立在这款产品上。他将手机屏幕比作世界上最宝贵的地产，认为它连接着数亿有强大购买力的人，让他们能够做生意、获取信息，这已经成为他们生活的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's a clip of Buffett from eight years ago explaining why they bought Apple, and we'll try to compare what that means to why Birchar is potentially buying Google. volatile stock. It kind of traded in this boom and bust cycle. Every time they had a new phone that came out, it would push the stock higher. If they didn't have a new release, it would drop. He said that it's still 65% of the business, but a lot of people are are maybe looking at it a little differently. And he wonders how you look at it. Is this a boom and bust cycle or is there something >> I don't you know, I'd like to see the new release do well or you know that. But I I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year. I I focus on the they won't tell you exactly how many, but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who practically live their lives by it. And if you look at that little uh piece of whatever it is, you that is some of the most valuable real estate in the world. I mean, that is Fifth Fifth Avenue will never come close to that. I mean it it is you've got you've got hundreds and hundreds of millions of people with loads of buying power and able to do business uh or learn information or whatever it may be and they and it's part of their habitable living. I mean they spend hours a day and it does all kinds of things for them. So that that real estate is is worth a fortune and it's nice to have it added to as they sell new phones and of course a lot of them are replacement phones but net</p>
</details>

正如你所见，巴菲特从未真正将苹果视为一家科技公司，而是看作一家拥有大规模分销渠道的消费硬件公司。正因如此，你可以在这个渠道之上建立许多业务。他职业生涯20%的收益都来自苹果。他们在苹果市值5000亿美元时买入，在大约3万亿美元时卖出。他们目前仍持有大量苹果股票，但在第三季度卖掉了16%的苹果持仓，并将投资组合的2%配置到了谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as you can see, Buffett never really, and there's plenty of other interviews that I'm talking about this, but Buffett never fully thought of Apple as a technology company. He thought of them as a consumer hardware play and that consumer hardware had mass distribution. As a result, you could build a lot of business on top of that mass distribution. And um the reason he ended up caging 20% for his career is because of Apple. In the last 10 years, they bought at a $500 billion market cap and they basically sold at around a $3 trillion market cap. They still have a decent amount of Apple, but they did sell 16% of their Apple stake in Q3 and they loaded up 2% of the portfolio in Google.</p>
</details>

对我来说，这意味着伯克希尔正在某种程度上验证人工智能交易的价值。为什么这么说？首先，他们持有的**美国国库券**（T-bills: 由美国财政部发行的短期债务证券）比美联储还多，手握3000亿美元现金。其次，除了苹果，他们从不碰科技股，错过了过去30年里几乎所有的技术变革和相关衍生股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to me, the takeaway here is that I think Buffett is or I shouldn't say Buffett, Birkshshire because he's retiring is validating a bit of the AI trade. And why do I think that? Well, they have more T bills than the Federal Reserve. They have $300 billion in cash and they never touch technology outside of Apple. I mean they have missed every single technological change revolution play and then the derivative stocks that were associated with that over the past 30 years.</p>
</details>

购买一家全球**资本支出**（Capex: 公司用于获取、升级和维护实体资产的资金）最高的公司之一（谷歌明年将在数据中心上花费约1000亿美元）的1800万股股票，如果你认为人工智能是个泡沫，这是完全说不通的。顺便说一句，谷歌上周五宣布未来5年将在德州再投资400亿美元建设数据中心。如果你认为数据中心的支出是愚蠢的，人工智能是虚假的，**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，现已成为人工智能计算的关键）是骗局，认为会有大量GPU闲置，所有这些资本支出都会打水漂，那么你根本不会碰谷歌这样的股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buying 18 million shares of one of the largest capex spenders on the planet which is going to spend about hundred billion dollars next year on data centers doesn't make sense if you think AI is a bubble. By the way, Google announced 40 billion more in data centers for Texas over the next 5 years on Friday. I mean, if you think the data center spend is stupid, if you think AI is not real, if you think the GPUs are fake, if you think there's going to be a ton of uh GPUs that are never used and all this capex spend is going to go down the gutter, you you wouldn't touch a stock like like Google.</p>
</details>

当然，谷歌可能比英伟达更能抵御泡沫破裂，因为英伟达的收入完全来自芯片销售，而谷歌除了自家的TPU外，还有许多其他衍生业务，所以谷歌本身具备很高的安全性。但尽管如此，如果你认为人工智能是假的，纳斯达克即将面临20%到30%的回调——这是我周末从很多人那里听到的论调——那么伯克希尔为什么要向谷歌投入50亿美元呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Google's probably a lot more resilient to um some type of of a bubble pop than like an Nvidia because obviously Nvidia gets all their revenue from chip sales. Google has a lot of other derivative businesses besides their TPUs. So, there's a lot of safety baked into Google. But nonetheless, if you think AI is fake and you think the NASDAQ's getting ready for a 20 to 30% correction, which is the chatter I've heard over the weekend, quite frankly, by a lot of different people saying they think NASDAQ's ready to go down in 2026 aggressively. I mean, why would Bergkshire put $5 billion into Google?</p>
</details>

有人说，“这只占投资组合的2%。”但50亿美元就是50亿美元。如果谷歌股价要下跌，他们基本上是在顶部追高买入。他们不是在谷歌市值1000亿美元时买的。所以，如果你认为纳斯达克有20%到30%的下跌空间，谷歌股价也会受到重创，那么投资国库券的回报会更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People like, "Oh, that's only 2% of the portfol." I mean, I don't know about you, but five billion is five billion. If Google's going to go down, by the way, they're FOMOing five billion basically at the top. I mean, they probably didn't buy literally Google at the top, but like it's been 20 years, right? They're not buying Google at a hundred billion dollar valuation. So, if you think the NASDAQ's got 20 30% down to go, which Google will survive that, it's just Google's stock price will also get hit pretty bad, you would get a better return in T- bills.</p>
</details>

坦白说，如果你在2024年11月购买10年期国债，你的表现会比比特币还好，因为比特币今年的价格走势正式转为负值。虽然现在有所反弹，全年上涨约1%，但在跌至93美元时，全年是下跌的。所以，如果你认为有一个巨大的AI泡沫即将破裂，为什么要在200到250美元的价位买入谷歌呢？这对我来说毫无道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, quite frankly, if you bought the 10-year Treasury in November of 2024 over Bitcoin, you have done better than Bitcoin, which is because Bitcoin's price action today officially went negative for the year. It's bouncing back up now, so now it's up like 1% for the year, but when it was at 93, it was negative for the year. So, why would they buy Google at anywhere near $200 to $250 if you thought there was some massive AI bubble that was getting ready to pop? I mean, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</p>
</details>

我也不认为你会用50亿美元建仓，然后在未来90天内就抛售。伯克希尔不是这样运作的。如果他们开始这样交易，那他们将会吸引一类新的投资者，因为大多数购买伯克希尔股票的人都是看重其长期投资理念。伯克希尔的投资哲学影响了众多追随者，而且这是一家能让整个体育馆坐满股东的控股公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I also don't think you take a $5 billion position in something that you're going to flip in the next 90 days. Like, that's just not how Birkshshire operates. If that is how they start trading, then I think they're going to in in uh inquire a new class of investors because most people that buy Birkshshire are buying into a long-term thesis. That's how Birkshar has taught a lot of their disciples on investing and also this is a holding company that sells out entire arenas of shareholders.</p>
</details>

我认为，仅仅因为巴菲特入场而购买苹果的人数众多，同样的效果也可能在谷歌身上发生。如果他们准备长期持有，那显然意义重大。

<p class="english-text">So the amount of people that I think are going to buy Google just b I mean the amount of people that bought Google purely bec or Apple purely because of Buffett getting in I think that same effect could take place on Google and if they are getting ready to hold it for a long time then obviously that would be really important as well.</p>

### 市场动态速览：隔夜市场与个股表现

好了，现在是美国东部时间晚上8点，隔夜市场已经开盘。让我们看看情况。期货市场是绿色的，标普500指数上涨0.26%。谷歌当然也在上涨，股价再次达到292美元。有数百万，甚至可以说数千万的人虔诚地追随伯克希尔。如果伯克希尔的下一个大赌注是谷歌，他们是不会做空谷歌的。所以我认为仅凭这一点就足以支撑谷歌股价继续走高。

<p class="english-text">All right here we go overnight markets it is 8:00 p.m. Eastern. They are now open and let's see what we've got. Futures are green. S&P 500 up 26%. That goes green 673 69 Palunteer that's up about 1% after hours 17550. Nebus that's up 3%. 8602 IRM that's up 2.8%. Regetti that's up 3%. Dwave that's up 3%. Bit mine 1.74 that's up. Tesla that's up a little bit. Rocket Lab that's up 1.19%. Robin Hood that's up 1%. Robin Hood even with crypto coming down. Robin Hood going up is uh very good. Google of course Google making a move. There you go. 292 again. You've got millions I mean one could argue tens of millions of people that follow Bergkshire religiously. They are not going to fade Google if uh Bergkshire's next big bet is Google. So I think that alone is going to justify Google you know potentially going higher.</p>

谷歌股价目前为293美元，上涨了5.63%。上一次谷歌触及290美元区间是在那次大规模财报发布之后，但一周后因为政府关门事件而受到打压。有人可能会说，自那次财报以来，它就应该值这个价。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Obviously we'll see tomorrow what happens when the market opens but Google right there 293. That's up 5.6. 63%. Last time Google was touching the 290s was after that massive earnings that got disrespected a week later because we had the shutdown. But uh one could argue that they deserved to be at that since the earnings.</p>

有消息称，美国计划在感恩节前与中国敲定贸易协议。这个消息源 Basent 说的东西有时准有时不准。这可能是市场情绪乐观的另一个原因，但我们还得看感恩节前是否真能实现。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yes, we do have that headline from Basent. Basent said that the US is planning uh to have the trade deal finalized with China by Thanksgiving. Now, Basent says a lot of things. Sometimes they're true, sometimes they're not. That could be another reason why the market uh is happy, but we're going to have to see if that ends up happening by Thanksgiving.</p>

谷歌股价持续上涨，现在是293美元。这支股票会不会因为巴菲特的入场而冲上300美元？我不知道，但这并不会让我感到意外。我认为，伯克希尔投资这样一家公司是多么严肃的事情，甚至无法用言语来形容。他们买的不是某个不知名的保险公司，而是一家家喻户晓的公司。他们是在这只股票今年已经上涨60%之后买入的。他们买的也不是一家他们过去从不触碰的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yeah, Google right here, 293. I mean, look, does this thing run to 300 now that Buffett's in? Um, I don't know, but it would not surprise me. That is I I I don't think we can even I don't even think words can put into reality how serious it is for Birkshshire to stake in a company like this. Like, they're not buying some random insurance company. They're buying a company that is universally known. They're buying a company that's up 60% this year after the run. They didn't buy at 150 like, you know, or 130 last year. And they're buying a company they would never touch.</p>

芒格（Charlie Munger）以前在一些采访中谈到，谷歌是他们错过的最大的一只股票，他对此非常后悔。所以，这家公司一直对谷歌持积极看法，只是因为他们出于某些原因对科技投资抱有偏见，才导致他们错过了。现在他们终于承认是时候进场了，这相当不可思议。谷歌股价上涨6.2%，触及294美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, Munger has some interviews from back in the day where he's talking about how Google was the biggest stock they missed and how he was so regretful that they never ended up investing Google. So, the firm has always had a positive view towards Google. It's just their anti-tech bias for, you know, whatever reasons they were not a fan of in technology investing that led them to to miss it. And so for them to finally admit, wow, Google 6.2% touching 294. The fact that they're finally admitting it's time to get in is quite incredible.</p>
</details>

我认为市场会对此给予非常好的回报。此外，下周还有Gemini 3.0的发布。许多预测市场都认为Gemini 3.0会非常出色。有人猜测伯克希尔可能提前体验了Gemini 3.0，并在其发布前买入，因为他们知道这个模型会有多强大。许多人工智能研究人员都认为它将成为地球上最好的模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that will be rewarded by the markets very nicely. Micron right there, that's up 3% as well. Gemini 3.0 next week as well. Yeah, you got a lot of the prediction markets saying Gemini 3.0 is going to be pretty phenomenal. I mean, you got some people speculating that Birkshshire got a little bit of an early taste of Gemini 3.0 you know, and uh they're buying it ahead of its release because they just know how powerful that model is going to be. You know, you got a lot of different AI researchers saying they think it's going to be the single best model on the planet.</p>

### 年底行情预测与历史数据分析

让我们来听听汤姆·李周五的看法。他认为市场在10月份之前已经连续上涨了六个月，处于超买状态。他预计会有两周的盘整，而这也正是我们所经历的。再加上美联储的鹰派言论，市场出现了一些小恐慌。但他仍然认为，从现在到年底，我们有非常好的季节性因素，财报表现良好，市场情绪已经转为负面。因此，他认为到年底，股市的风险回报仍然非常好，标普500指数将超过7000点，甚至可能在本月底就达到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, I just want to play this quick clip from Tom Lee on Friday. Here's what he's thinking about the choppiness in the market and what he's expecting for the end of the month. >> All right, let's pivot to the market itself. Uh is your confidence at all shaken in in where we are and what you thought the prospects for an endofear run could be after what we've seen this week? Well, it's never fun to see markets um wobble and then stocks that are quite popular like AI and the quantum uh and nuclear come down so hard, but it is consistent with the idea that, you know, we were up six months through October. So, the market's overbought. We expected two weeks of consolidation, which is what we're getting. And then, of course, as you know, there's hawkish Fed talk. So, there's a bit of a tantrum the market's having. But between now and year end, we still have really good seasonals. The earnings have been good. Sentiment has flipped negative, Scott, as you could tell. I mean, the AI went to negative 17.5. So, I I'd say the riskreward is still really good for equities into year end. And yeah, I think the S&P will be over 7,000 by the end of the year. You know, in fact, maybe over 7,000 by the end of the month.</p>
</details>

汤姆·李仍然预测标普500指数将达到7000点，这大约还有5%的上涨空间，并非遥不可及。这是他们周末通讯中的一张图表，预测2025年标普500指数将实现21%的年终涨幅。我们现在已经实现了大约16%，汤姆预计另外5%将在第四季度的年底追逐行情中实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, so you got Tom Lee that's still calling for an S&P 7,000, which was about 5% away. So, I mean, it's not impossible to imagine that that could take place. This was one of the charts from their newsletter this weekend and here's what they're predicting. So 2022 S&P 500 returned negative 19%. 23 you had 24%. 2024 you had 23%. 2025 they're estimating a 21% endofear gain for the S&P 500. We have about 16% of that right now. And uh Tom is expecting another 5% of that would happen in this fourth quarter chase by end of year.</p>
</details>

他们提出的论点是，基金经理的业绩是按三年期来评判的。如果标普500指数连续三年上涨20%，那么基金经理的业绩至少要接近这个水平。如果某些基金经理的三年业绩为负，或者远低于基准，这可能会引发一轮追逐行情。我认为这是可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The argument here that they're making is that uh fund managers are judged on their three-year performance. And if you do end up getting a bit of a run on the S&P 500, you know, if those three years end up checking out negative for certain fund managers or just like vastly underperforming against the benchmark, which which if the S&P is up 20% three years in a row, then you've got to be at least around that ballpark. That could lead to a chase. I think that is possible.</p>
</details>

但反过来说，如果市场下跌，基准变得更难达到，客户也更愿意接受基金经理未能实现良好回报的道歉，因为整个市场都在亏损。因此，如果因为宏观因素出现任何程度的回调，那么年底的追逐行情可能就不会发生。 realistically，这轮追逐行情需要在一周左右的时间内开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the opposite is also something that everyone just has to be aware of which is that if the market ends up coming down the benchmark becomes less attainable because obviously markets are coming down and you know clients would be willing to listen to the apology of not being able to deliver good returns because if the entire market's losing money then you know you can't be mad at your fund manager for losing money. So if you do get any level of a draw down because of something related to the macro and we'll talk about some of the different things that we have going on next week from a macro perspective then maybe that end of your chase doesn't happen. So realistically, you're going to have to see that chase start in the next week or so.</p>

高盛表示，上周五我们刚刚经历了自DeepSeek事件以来高贝塔动量股最大单日跌幅。这是有道理的，像Oaklo、量子、核能以及加密货币相关的股票都受到了重创，比一般的科技七巨头跌得更惨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Goldman Sachs right here said on last Friday we just had the biggest one-day draw down in high beta momentum since the deepseek debacle. This is Asper Goldens trading desk. And this makes sense, right? Your Oaklo stock, your quantum, your nuclear, uh, your cryptoplay, obviously, Micro Strategy, BMR, all of these got hit pretty bad. Uh, and and and worse than your average Mac 7, right?</p>
</details>

问题是，上周五是这些高贝塔动量股的底部吗？还是市场会说，我们真的不想信任这些没有盈利、没有基本面、完全靠炒作（其中很多是散户投资者推动的）的公司？我们是否应该最终抛弃它们，把资金投向英伟达，或者现在巴菲特验证了的谷歌？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the question is, is was that the bottom on Friday on all of these high beta momentum names? Or does the market say, you know what, we really, really do not want to trust these companies that are putting up no earnings, have no fundamentals, and quite frankly are just built off hype, a lot of that hype being constituted by retail investors. Do we want to just finally take it out and say, you know what, that money's got to go to Nvidia. That money's got to go to Google now that Buffett has validated Google.</p>
</details>

我的直觉告诉我，周五更像是一次洗盘。如果像Oaklo这样的股票继续下跌，它影响的只是市场的一小部分，不会影响那些真正有基本面的公司。但如果不是，那么我认为人们需要为更多的回调做好准备。而那些真正有基本面的公司，比如Rocket Lab，如果你看到它大幅下跌，这些跌幅会被市场消化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My gut tells me Friday was a little bit more of the flush out. And you know, if if an oak low still goes down more, again, it affects a very small part of the market. does not affect the companies that really fundamentally matter. But if it's not, then I think people just have to be prepared for a little bit more of a draw down. And quite frankly, the companies that really do have fundamentals like a Rock Lab, if you see a big dip on that, those dips get eaten up.</p>

关于2026年，我周末发现了一张不太乐观的图表。自1950年以来，每一个中期选举年，标普500指数都经历了平均16%的从峰值到谷底的下跌。这几乎像是一种魔咒。最近的一次是2022年，下跌了25.4%。问题是，2026年还会发生这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, 2026, what's going to happen in 2026? Well, I found a chart this weekend, and this chart is not pretty. Let me just say that right here. Uh, it's an ugly chart, but nonetheless, it is data that we have to be aware of. Every midterm year since 1950, every single one has had an S&P 500 peakto trough decrease of average of 16%. I mean, it's kind of spooky how every freaking midterm year this ends up happening. The last one you had was in 2022, 25.4% down. Obviously, that was pretty ugly. And uh you know, we all live through that one. 2018 was 19%, 2014 was 7% and on goes the declines. The question is, does that happen in 2026?</p>
</details>

不过，一年后的回报率平均为33%，所以你不仅能弥补前一年的损失，而且平均来看还会翻倍。当然，一张图表并不能说明一切，有很多历史先例在2024年和2025年被打破了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the one year later return is on average 33%. So, you make up all of the return that you had lost in the previous year and then it doubles on average going into the next year. Um question is, you know, do we end up seeing that in 2026? And I think obviously one chart is not everything. There's, you know, plenty of different historical precedences that have been uh violated in 2024 and 2025.</p>
</details>

我又找到了另一张图表，在某种程度上与此相悖。在政府关门事件发生一年后，标普500指数在22次中有19次是上涨的，平均涨幅超过12.7%。所以，一张图表说中期选举年标普500平均下跌17%，另一张图表说政府关门后一年（也就是2026年）平均上涨12.3%。这两个相互矛盾的数据报告将在2026年相互对抗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I found another chart right here that kind of goes at odds with this to an extent. Um, after a shutdown, a year later, the S&P 500 is up 19 out of 22 times and up better than an average of 12.7%. So, the first chart says that in a midterm year, the S&P 500 is down 17% on average. The next chart says after a shutdown the year later, which would be 2026 because we just had the longest shutdown ever, you're up on average 12.3%. So you got two different conflicting data reports that are going to be going against each other going into 2026.</p>

### 加密货币市场：去杠杆化与周期理论的终结？

迈克尔·塞勒（Michael Saylor）认为，比特币现在的价格相当稳定，大部分清算抛售已经结束，市场应该会从这里开始反弹。他不再相信四年周期理论，认为现在市场的动态更多地受到宏观经济、政治和结构性因素的影响，比如杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）希望将利率维持在较高水平更长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is what Michael Sailor had to say about what's going on with Bitcoin. >> How low you think Bitcoin goes in the cycle right here? If it goes any lower, where does it go? >> I think it's pretty stable where it is right now. I mean, most of the liquidation selling is out of the system. I think we should rally from here >> and then where what do you think it ends? I DON'T BUT I don't believe in four year cycles any they might have had some credence in the first 12 years but I right now >> the fouryear cycle is somehow based on the idea that 225 bitcoin a day get taken out of the supply after the next havinging that's $22 million or $20 million of buying trust me $20 million of buying the market traded hundred billion yesterday 20 million is is not even a third order issue at this point >> yeah the dynamics in the market are much more that you know Jerome Pal thinks he wants to hold interest rates higher for longer right it's macroeconomics it's political it's structural when you know when IBIT's derivatives market went from 10 billion to 50 billion it did that in four weeks I mean so so those kind of things when JP Morgan you know offers 10 or hundred billion dollars of loans against Bitcoin that will dwarf the four-year cycle</p>
</details>

Bitwise ETF 的主管亨特·霍斯利（Hunter Horsley）也提出了一个有趣的观点。他认为，如果人们普遍相信四年周期，并因此在2025年抛售以避免2026年的下跌，那么这种抛售行为本身就会导致2025年成为下跌年，从而打破了四年周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have a bit of a breakaway from uh Sailor in this four-year cycle. Here's what uh Hunter Horesley said. He's the director of the Bit Wise ETF. He says, "Common view, people believe in four-year cycles and that 2026 will thus be a down year for Bitcoin. First order effect, people thus sell in 2025 to avoid the down market year. Second order effect, the 2025 sellers causing 2025 to be a down year, thus breaking the four-year cycle. Third order effect, 2025 is open season. Four-year cycle has been broken.</p>
</details>

我个人认为，加密货币的制度化，比如银行准备接受比特币作为抵押品发放贷款，显示了像摩根大通这样的机构正在开始承认这个资产类别的合法性。这比任何周期理论都更令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I personally just think all the institutionalization of crypto as Sailor was saying the fact that people are or the banks are getting ready to give people loans against their crypto particularly their Bitcoin as collateral goes to show you how much an institution like JP Morgan which you know Jamie Diamond has hated crypto for the past decade is starting to legitimize the asset class because if you get a loan against an asset the bank obviously thinks the asset has enough value to let you borrow money against it and I think that's going to be a lot more exciting</p>
</details>

值得注意的是，哈佛大学的捐赠基金在第三季度的最大持仓和最大增持仓位都是贝莱德的比特币ETF——IBIT，他们增持了3.26亿美元。对于一个本应保守的捐赠基金来说，这是一个相当惊人的举动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but nonetheless crypto performance this year has not been that strong in the face of that. Take a look at this. Speaking of 13Fs, Harvard's endowment fund, their largest position and their biggest position increase in Q3 was IBIT, the Bitcoin ETF from Black Rockck. They added $326 million to that in the Q3. Um, that's not easy to do. You know, when you're an endowment from Harvard, you know, you're supposed to be just preserving the money, buying the stuff that's basic, not getting in trouble. you know, if Google goes down by 10% and you buy Google, no one's going to blame you. The fact that they're taking IBIT as their number one position is quite incredible, especially given the fact that um you know, a lot I imagine a lot of the Harvard bit uh economic professors don't believe in Bitcoin.</p>

### AI 的未来：乐观主义、就业冲击与监管辩论

埃隆·马斯克对人工智能的未来持更乐观的看法。他认为，像擎天柱（Optimus）这样的机器人将能够执行超高精度的医疗手术，让每个人都能接触到最好的外科医生，从而消除贫困和提供优质医疗服务。他认为，虽然人们常谈论这些目标，但从未有真正的解决方案，而现在，这些解决方案将在工厂里被制造出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, you got Elon posting a more optimistic view of AI. I know we've been talking a lot about the labor market and what's going to happen in the world of AI if the labor market becomes commoditized via robots and, you know, LLMs, etc. And I think that's still a question around what happens to the labor market. But you got Elon with the optimistic view of hey we are going to eliminate the cost of goods being so high by massive massive levels of deflation because the robots or the AI at large is going to be doing all the things that we paid humans to do and as those costs significantly go down that will be a way in the mind of Elon to potentially eliminate forms of poverty.</p>
</details>

然而，加州的政治家罗·康纳（Ro Khanna）提出了一个论点，即我们需要认真思考所有正在进行的人工智能创新，如果它会减少就业岗位，我们可能需要阻止其中一些。他认为，我们需要法规来防止公司利用人工智能裁员以获取更大利润，并应对大规模失业问题征税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, this optimistic view is going to be very important by a lot of the thought leaders of AI that exist in our society because you had a politician over the weekend, Ro Kana, who from California, uh, who made an argument that said, "We need to seriously think about all of the AI innovation that's going on. um and we need to potentially stop some of it if it's going to lower jobs. And you had David Friedberg come out with a super long response and basically say that you're an idiot and that there's no way that we can allow technology to stop progressing just to be able to uh save jobs, which is obviously the argument that a lot of the billionaire class and a lot of the arguments that are in the shareholder class are going to be promoting because pretty obvious AI increases margins. Replacing humans increases margins and increased margins increases shareholder returns. Uh, but you're going to have politicians that are going to come out against it. You really will. Look at this Roana. We need eliminations or regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists that these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits and there should be a tax on mass displacement.</p>
</details>

我认为，未来不可避免地会出现一位政治家，无论是民主党还是共和党，他会通过监管或重税来保护人们的工作岗位，从而获得权力。如果亚马逊通过用机器人取代200万工人，在10年内节省了3000亿美元，那么这笔钱的一部分可能会被政府征收并以某种方式重新分配。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it is inevitable that there will be a politician that rises to power, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, off the idea of protecting people's jobs by regulating the crap out of the AI companies or at least taxing the crap out of them to make sure that what if Amazon saves, you know, $300 billion over 10 years by replacing two million workers with robots that some of that 300 billion comes to the government and gets redistributed in some way. But it just seems inevitable.</p>

### 投资者情绪与2026年风险对冲策略

对于2026年，我认为人们持有对冲头寸是有道理的。特别是如果你在英伟达有大量仓位，买入英伟达的看跌期权是有意义的。我并不是说要退出市场，我认为那太极端了。阿斯沃斯教授基本上用一个半小时的时间吓唬大家，说我们应该逃离市场，因为我们正处于泡沫之中。我认为这太极端，也有些傲慢，低估了未知因素的潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it makes a lot of sense for people to have hedges. I mean, pick whatever stock you want to hedge against, but especially if you have a, you know, if you have a huge Nvidia position, I think it makes sense to have an Nvidia hedge. simple as buying puts on Nvidia. Um, if you have a huge, you know, leveraged position against the market being long and you're up 300% over the past couple years, it I don't think it hurts you to buy some puts on the spy just in case things don't go as well. I think I I I I don't think the plan the way I'm thinking of it right now for 2026 and again all six of these things are very reasonable to happen and you know that could create like like a bare market scenario. I don't think the argument is to get out of the markets. I think that's too extreme and that's what Ashwath We'll talk about Bill Aman. I see you guys talking about him. Bill Aman had a hell of a tweet this weekend. We'll talk about that. But um I I I I I I think Ashwath on the the Profod basically scared everybody for an hour and a half and said you should just get the hell out of markets because we're in a bubble. And I think that's too extreme. I think that's a bit too arrogant and that's undermining the potential of not knowing what you don't know.</p>
</details>

这些公司可能会因为人工智能的重要性而继续表现出色，就像过去几年一样。但这并不意味着劳动力市场不会崩盘，关税逆转可能对市场造成问题，通胀可能再次抬头，美联储可能在未来九个月内都不会降息。有很多理由支持在2026年进行对冲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">these companies might end up continuing to outperform like they have over the past couple years because AI is as serious as it is and it's as important as it is. But that doesn't mean to say labor market can't fall off a cliff. Um the uh tariff implication of that being reversed could have you know issues in the market. Inflation potentially flare up again and the Fed might not end up cutting for the next nine months. I mean like there's a lot of different arguments for why I think having a hedge in 2026 makes sense.</p>

本周的策略是：关注美国劳工统计局（BLS）的数据；市场能否稳定，能否守住上周663点的低点；谷歌能否在标普500指数的潜在上涨中保持势头；以及周三的英伟达财报。我个人对这次财报毫无焦虑，我认为他们会彻底超出预期。我更担心的是劳动力市场数据，因为如果劳动力市场恶化，即使英伟达业绩再好，也无济于事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the game plan for this week is what data do we get from the BLS? Uh can market stabilize and can we not violate the lows that we had last week 663 on the S&P 500? What happens to Google as the S&P 500 now is going to get a bit of a surge to or potentially get a bit of a surge if Google holds on to this momentum and if you know potentially Google touches 300 Google right here up 6% again 6% on a $3.3 trillion company is a very big move. So that's going to have a big move across the entire market if that holds itself. And then number four, Nvidia earnings. I'll be live with Jose 3:30 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday. That is going to be a massive, massive quarter. Honestly, as someone who made Nvidia one of my top three positions this year, I have zero anxiety going into this earnings because I think they're going to absolutely demolish the quarter. Like, I really don't think this is going to be a quarter where people need to be scared. I'm more concerned about the labor market data because, yeah, I think could Nvidia, you know, end the year at around 210, 220? I think that's possible. I think it's probably going to be there around that 195 205 range and that's bullish you know more conservatively probably in the 180s to 190 range but none of it matters if we are starting to see a deterioration in the labor market so I think Nvidia will be fine</p>

### 市场之外的趣闻：从投资大佬的约会建议谈起

比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman），一位富有的亿万富翁对冲基金经理，发推文说，他听到很多年轻男性觉得在公共场合认识年轻女性很困难。他分享了自己年轻时用过的一句话来认识他觉得有魅力的人。他会问：“我可以认识你吗？”（May I meet you?）他声称几乎从未被拒绝过，并认为正确的语法和礼貌是其有效的关键。

<p class="english-text">So, for those that didn't see the news, Bill Aman, wealthy billionaire hedge fund manager, I hear from many young men that they find it difficult to meet young women in a public setting. In other words, the online culture has destroyed the ability to spontaneously meet strangers. As such, I thought I would share a few words that I used in my youth to meet someone that I found compelling. I would ask, "May I meet you?" before engaging further in a conversation. I almost never got a no. It inevitably enabled the opportunity for a further conversation. I met a lot of really interesting people this way. I think the combination of proper grammar and politeness was the was the key to its effectiveness. You might give it a try. And yes, I think it should work for women seeking men as well as samesex interactions. Just two cents from an older happily married guy concerned about our next generation's happiness and population replacement rates.</p>

我不知道在酒吧里对一个女孩说“我可以认识你吗？”是否真的管用，但这在周末引发了大量的病毒式传播。这很有趣，也许真的有效。

<p class="english-text">Look, I don't know if you go up to a girl at a bar and say, "May I meet you?" if that's your ticket to interacting with her a little more, a little more. Maybe it is. Maybe it is. Maybe that's actually effective. But the amount of tweets over the weekend that have been going viral, and Bill Aman's loving this. I mean, he retweeted this. I mean, this was hilarious.</p>

斯科特·加洛韦（Scott Galloway）也谈到了社会孤立这个更大的问题。他甚至认为，为了社交和认识某人，喝点酒，哪怕损害肝脏也是值得的，因为社交孤立的风险远大于对25岁肝脏的风险。他认为，远程工作是发生在年轻人身上的第二件最糟糕的事情，而反酒精运动则是最糟糕的。

<p class="english-text">you know he is speaking to something that we are having a broader issue in society which is this idea of of of of very less social interaction I mean if you look at the charts on the first of all the most obvious chart on this is is is population collapse I mean even it's not in just in Japan and the United States as well like just not having as many people interact with each other anymore for I mean it got to the point where Scott Galloway who I don't agree with him on everything but uh he has been talking about this loneliness epidemic a decent amount and his argument was you should you should uh um you should be okay with ruining your liver and and getting drunk in order to meet somebody and have social interaction because that is what that is what you need to actually you know not be lonely. Here's what he said over the weekend. >> The second worst thing to happen to young people is remote work. Uh one in three relationships begin at work. This is where you find friends, mentors, and mates, and especially young men need the guardrails of a workplace. But in my view, the worst thing that's happened to young people is the anti-alcohol movement. I've had Hubberman on who I'm a big fan of and ate on and my point is that the risks to your 25-year-old liver are risk are are dwarfed by the risk of so social isolation in some. Think of all the amazing relationships you've had in your life and be honest. Did alcohol play a role in some. Get out, drink more, and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.</p>

我并不完全同意他的观点，我认为你不必喝醉才能认识人。但他的核心论点是，社会孤立是一个大问题。这就是为什么像比尔·阿克曼这样的人会发推谈论这些，因为很多年长的人认识到年轻人社交的困难，并鼓励他们多与人交流。

<p class="english-text">I don't know if I fully agree with that. I don't think you have to be drunk to uh meet people. Yeah, mocktails do the job. Mocktails do the job. From personal experience, I can tell. But um his broader argument is just social isolation is a big deal. And so that's why you have Bill Aman tweeting about this stuff because, you know, a lot of the older folks are recognizing how hard it is for younger people to meet and as a result, you know, they are uh encouraging people to just go up and and and and talk more with each other, which I think is not horrible advice. I don't know if you have to be drunk to do that, but nonetheless, that's one of the arguments that's taking place.</p>

最后，加文·贝克（Gavin Baker）提出了一个有力的论点，反驳了当前的AI泡沫论。他指出，2000年的互联网泡沫以“暗光纤”为特征，即铺设了但未被点亮使用的光纤。在泡沫顶峰时期，美国97%的光纤是暗的。相比之下，今天没有“暗GPU”。所有公司能弄到的GPU都在被使用，甚至因为过热而熔化。这表明需求是真实存在的。此外，对GPU投入最大的上市公司的**投入资本回报率**（ROIC: 用于评估公司将资本分配到盈利性投资中效率的指标）在加大资本支出后都出现了约10个百分点的增长，证明了AI投资的积极回报。

<p class="english-text">Daily earnings, Nvidia is at more like 40 times. So, valuations are very differently. Very different. Most important however Cisco peaked at 150 or 180 times trailing earnings. Nvidia is at more like 40 times. So valuations are very differently very different. Most important however is that the year 2000 internet bubble or telecom bubble was defined by something called dark fiber. Um and [clears throat] if you're a veteran of of the year 2000 you'll know what that was. But dark fiber was literally fiber that was laid down in the ground and not lit up. Fiber is useless unless you have the optics and switches and routers uh that you need on either side. Um you so I vividly remember, you know, companies like Level 3 or Global Crossing or WorldCom would come in and they say, "We laid 200,000 miles of dark fiber this quarter. This is so amazing. The internet's going to be so big. Um you know, we can't wait to light these up." At the peak of the bubble, 97% of the fiber that had been laid in America was dark. Contrast that with today. There are no dark GPUs. All you have to do is read any technical paper and that one of the biggest problems in a trading run is that GPUs are melting. And there's >> this was a really compelling point to me because every person you listen to, every earnings we see, there's not enough GPUs. I mean, Nvidia is literally pressuring TSMC to increase the wafer uh capacity by 50% because their month- over-month demand is exceeding the amount of supply that they have. So, I mean, there is a reasonable argument to say the.com bubble with all this dark fiber never ended up being used, which is what inevitably caused a lot more companies to crash. And I know there's more nuance to it, but that was a big part of it. In this part of a technological revolution, every GPU companies can get their hands on, they are using, which means there is a reason for why they're buying them in the first place. A very simple way to kind of cut to the heart of all of this, it is the return on invested capital of the biggest spenders on GPUs who are all public. And those companies since they ramped up capex have seen call it a 10point increase in their ROIC's. So, thus far, the ROI on all the spending has been really positive. It's a really it's an interesting and open debate about whether or not it will continue to be positive with the quantum of spend we're going to have on Blackwell. I personally think it will, but there's no debate that thus far the ROI on AI has been really positive and valuation wise. We're just not in a bubble.</p>
