### 联邦与安大略省的财政概览

加拿大**联邦预算**（Federal Budget: 加拿大联邦政府的年度财政计划，包含收入、支出和赤字预测）的总支出为2800亿加元，赤字达783亿加元。而**安大略省秋季经济更新**（Ontario's Fall Economic Update: 安大略省政府在秋季发布的经济报告，提供对财政状况和经济前景的最新评估）的支出约为2350亿加元，**赤字**（Deficit: 财政支出超过收入的部分）为135亿加元。这些数字在电子表格上一目了然，但它们究竟意味着什么？它们能告诉我们政府的真正优先事项以及政府在安大略省议会（Queen's Park）的实际立场和自主权吗？

<p class="english-text">The federal budget, $280 billion in overall spending, a $78.3 billion deficit. Then we have Ontario's fall economic update, around $235 billion in spending and a $13.5 billion deficit. That's how it shakes out on a spreadsheet. But what do those numbers actually mean? What can they tell us about our government's real priorities and our auto on Queen's Park? On the same page, I got some insight from TVO Today's John Michael McGrath. John Michael McGrath, welcome to the program. I feel like you're everywhere: tvo.org, OnPoli, and now you're officially on The Rundown. This looks probably a little familiar to you.</p>

<p class="english-text">TV magic nobody needs to know. All right, let's start with the Ontario Economic Update. What were the sort of big differences between this release versus let's go back to the spring 2025.</p>
</details>

### 安大略省经济更新：赤字、收入与担忧

约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉思: 安大略省的赤字为135亿加元，略低于政府今年早些时候在春季的预测。这主要是由于税收收入强于预期所致。政府在支出方面基本保持不变，没有大幅增长。尽管如此，政府仍对一些“暴风云”感到担忧，即经济困境。经济在前一个季度已经略有萎缩，虽然我们没有预测会出现彻底的**衰退**（Recession: 经济连续两个季度萎缩），但政府对此表示担忧。因此，这份秋季经济声明中包含了大量资金，旨在支持工人、企业，并帮助安大略省实现贸易多元化等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's a $13.5 billion deficit, which is a slightly smaller than what the government was projecting earlier this year in the spring. That's primarily being driven by stronger than expected tax revenues. And they've held the line more or less on spending. It has not grown very much. That said, there are some storm clouds that the government is worried about. Economic trouble. The economy has already contracted slightly in the previous quarter, and we're not projecting an outright recession, which is two quarters of consecutive shrinkage, but they are concerned about that. And so there's a lot of money in this budget. Sorry. This fall economic statement for, you know, supporting workers, supporting businesses, helping to diversify Ontario trade, that kind of thing.</p>

### 联邦预算赤字预测与省际比较

主持人: 好的。你谈到了预算。让我们看一些图表。这张图表展示的是联邦政府2025年预计的赤字。如果我们从左边看起，你会看到2025-26财年的赤字为780亿加元。图表中的深色数字代表了我们稍后将讨论的**资本投资**（Capital Investment: 对长期资产如基础设施、设备等的投资）。然后向右看，下一个财年赤字降至650亿加元，随后逐渐降至570亿加元。那么，安大略省的赤字预测与我们在联邦预算中看到的相比如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. You talked about budget. Let's show some graphs. Actually this is looking at the federal budgets 2025 projected deficits. If we start on the left, you'll see 78 billion for the 2020, 2526 year. You can see that dark number there. That is the capital investment which we will talk about. And then as you move down to the right, $65 billion to the next, and then we gradually fall to $57 billion. So how does Ontario's deficit projections compare with those we saw in the federal budget?</p>
</details>

### 财政赤字管理与资本投资策略

约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉思: 首先，安大略省的赤字规模较小。当然，安大略省的预算本身就小于联邦预算，但从省级层面来看，其赤字比联邦层面更容易管理。判断这一点的方式是，安大略省希望在两年内基本实现预算平衡。但联邦政府的情况并非如此。我们刚刚在图表中看到，从联邦层面来看，赤字几乎是“一眼望不到头”。如果联邦政府的计划能够按预期进行，赤字的性质将会发生变化。他们正寻求将赤字资金从政府的日常运营开支（这基本上是目前的情况）转向长期的资本投资。这正是马克·卡尼（Mark Carney: 前加拿大央行行长）所说的，他希望政府减少开支，但增加投资。因此，他们正在考虑大型资本项目，例如那些总是被承诺但从未建成的多伦多和蒙特利尔之间的高速铁路等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, smaller to begin with. The of course, the Ontario budget is smaller than the federal one, but the deficit is much more manageable provincially than it is federally. And the way you can tell that is that Ontario is hoping to have its budget more or less balanced within two years time. That is not the case federally. We just saw in that chart deficits more or less as far as the eye can see, federally speaking. Now, the type of deficit is going to change if the federal government's plans go the way they want to. So they are looking to really shift the deficit from funding the sort of the day to day operations of the government, which is more or less what is happening now and really hoping to shift that into longer term capital investments. This is what Mark Carney means when he says he wants the government to spend less but invest more. And so they are looking at big capital projects, things like the always promised, never built high speed rail between Toronto and Montreal, that kind of thing.</p>

### 资本投资的历史趋势与未来挑战

主持人: 好的，我们再来看另一张图表。这张图表显示了历史和预计的资本投资。你可以看到，从左侧的2020-2021财年开始，投资额略低，大约在100亿加元左右，然后上升到略低于300亿加元。接着，我们看到更大的数字。重要的是要区分这些数字中的历史数据和预测数据。在查看这张图表时，历史数据与预测数据之间的差异是否会发生剧烈变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, actually, let's pull up another chart here. This is the capital investments historical and projected. You can see on the left side from 2020 2021 a bit lower, around 10 billion to about just under 30 billion. And then we see these bigger numbers. Now it should be important to mention historical versus projected with those numbers. When we're looking at this chart, will that change drastically. Just looking at sort of what what historical versus projected.</p>
</details>

约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉思: 是的，关于这一点，我想说两件事。你可以看到，前几年资本支出一直在缓慢上升，但这并不能解释赤字。赤字主要是由自新冠疫情（COVID-19）以来支出的大幅增加所驱动的，特别是未来的增长。这才是我们真正需要观察联邦政府能否兑现其在推动资本支出方面的承诺的关键。这与马克·卡尼一直以来谈论的一些事情有关，例如，加快联邦项目的审批速度等。省级和联邦政府都已出台立法，旨在真正简化审批流程。到目前为止，我们已经看到了一些朝这个方向迈出的小步。当然，未来几年我们将看到联邦政府能否在增加支出的同时，加快审批速度，并真正更快地建成项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so I guess there's two things to say there. You can see that the capital spending has been heading up slowly in prior years, but that doesn't explain the deficit. The deficit is overwhelmingly been driven by a very large increase in spending since Covid 19. In particular, the future increases. That's really where we're going to see whether the federal government can really meet its promises in terms of getting capital spending out the door. And, you know, this is ties into things that Mark Carney has been talking about. About, you know, faster approvals for federal projects, that kind of thing. Both the provincial and federal government have introduced legislation to really streamline approvals, that kind of thing. And they so far, we've seen some small steps in that direction. The next several years, of course, we're going to see whether the federal government can match an increase in spending with faster approvals and actually get things built faster.</p>

### 对技术工人的支持与挑战

主持人: 好的。正如你所提到的，两国政府都宣布为**资本基础设施项目**（Capital Infrastructure Projects: 涉及长期资产建设和维护的大型公共工程项目）投入更多资金。那么，他们对**技术工人**（Skilled Trades: 需要特定技能、培训和认证的职业，通常涉及体力劳动或专业技术）的支持和资助有什么说法呢？显然，围绕这个话题有很多新闻头条。也许安大略省政府会说这些头条并不都是正面的，但他们为就业和未来所需的投资提供了哪些支持？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Both governments announced more money for capital infrastructure projects, as you mentioned. What did they say about support and funding for skilled trades? Obviously lots of headlines around that. Perhaps the Ontario government would say not the greatest headlines, but what kind of supports are there for jobs for for investments and that that will be required.</p>
</details>

约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉思: 是的。就像没有人在某个地方钉上一块木板，什么都建不起来。因此，两国政府都提供了大量资金来支持技术行业。你提到了省政府的**技能发展基金**（Skills Development Fund: 安大略省政府设立的基金，旨在支持技术工人培训和劳动力发展）。在过去几年里，政府已经向各个团体拨付了大约15亿加元。在当前的秋季经济声明中，该基金的资金水平保持不变。目前没有变化，无论是好是坏，因为在过去几周里，这笔资金一直备受争议，原因是部分资金接受者与政府存在政治关联，他们反过来又将部分资金用于与政府关系密切的游说者。所以，这确实有点丑闻。当然，政府否认有任何不当行为。我们应该指出，联邦预算确实包括了7500万加元，用于他们所称的**工会培训与创新计划**（Union Training and Innovation Program: 加拿大联邦政府的一项计划，旨在支持工会成员的技术培训和创新项目）。这项计划也旨在支持技术行业，特别是，顾名思义，工会化的技术行业。所以，你可以看到两国政府都非常清楚，他们希望建设更多项目，而建设这些项目需要技术工人。多年来，加拿大联邦和省级政府一直非常担心退休潮会使我们的技术劳动力队伍萎缩。因此，可以说这项工作早就应该进行了。而且，我们拭目以待这项计划将如何发展。我认为，在省级层面，在招募人们进入技术行业方面肯定取得了很大的成功。一位前劳工部长曾非常热衷于消除技术行业的污名，鼓励高中生将技术行业视为除了上大学之外的另一种选择。是的，他们正在为此努力，这显然是两级政府的优先事项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So like nothing gets built without somebody putting a nail in a two by four somewhere. And so both governments are making lots of money available to help support skilled trades. Now you alluded to the Skills Development Fund that the provincial government has. This is something like $1.5 billion that the government has disbursed to various groups over the last several years. That is staying at its current level of funding in the current fall economic statement. No changes there now, no changes, for better or worse, because of course, it has been a bit of a scandal for the last several weeks because it turns out that some of the recipients of that money have been politically aligned with the government, and they have then turned around in some cases and spent that money on lobbyists who are themselves close to the government. So a bit of a scandal there. The government, of course, denies any impropriety. We should say that federally, the budget does include $75 million for what they're calling the Union Training and Innovation Program. This is also intended to help support skilled trades and particularly, as the name implies, unionised skilled trades. So, you know, you can see both governments are very alive to this notion that they want to get things built, that building things is going to require skilled workers. For many years, both federal and provincial governments around Canada have been very worried about a wave of retirements shrinking our skilled trade labour force. So this might arguably be overdue. And, you know, again, I think we will see how this plays out. I think certainly provincially, there's been a lot of success in recruiting people into the skilled trades. And one of the prior Labour ministers was very, very passionate about what he said, like removing the stigma of the skilled trades, getting, you know, high school kids to think of trades as an alternative to solely going into university. And yeah, they are working on this and this is obviously a priority for both levels of government.</p>
