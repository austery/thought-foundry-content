### 引言与记者生涯概述

Brian，非常感谢您邀请我们到您温馨的家中做客。您最近怎么样？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Brian, thank you so much for having us in your lovely home. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

哦，很好。谢谢您，也很高兴能有您来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, great. Thank you and my pleasure to have you here.</p>
</details>

好的。您报道过很多重大事件。埃塞俄比亚饥荒。您去过萨尔瓦多。您去过科威特、黎巴嫩，几乎报道了整个冷战时期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. You have covered a lot. Ethiopian famine. You were in El Salvador. You were in Kuwait, Lebanon, covering pretty much the entire Cold War.</p>
</details>

### 记者工作的动力与情感代价

我想作为一名记者，您一直在努力前行，目睹了可能发生的许多最糟糕的事情。是什么支撑着您继续前进？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I imagine as a journalist, you are pushing through, seeing some of the worst things possible. What kept you going?</p>
</details>

嗯，我想这是作为一名记者的职业义务，是成为一名记者、一名我梦寐以求的外国记者，并且知道这项工作涉及风险与回报，有时是相当危险的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think it was the obligation of the craft, being a journalist, being a foreign correspondent, which is what I dreamt of, and knowing there was a risk reward involved in that work, that it was sometimes risky.</p>
</details>

我当时没有意识到情感上的痛苦会如此之深。我想，尤其是在1984年和1985年报道埃塞俄比亚饥荒，而且常常是连续数周甚至数月，这确实给我们所有参与报道的人带来了巨大的压力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't realise just how much the emotional suffering could be. And I think certainly covering the Ethiopian famine in 1984 and 85 and for often weeks and months on end, it did really cause major strain on all of us who were involved in that coverage.</p>
</details>

我们看到了许多我们根本无法真正准备好的事情。我曾以为自己可以为一切做好准备。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we saw things we couldn't really have even prepared for. I thought I could prepare for everything.</p>
</details>

### 埃塞俄比亚饥荒的亲历与希望的象征

当我于1984年抵达埃塞俄比亚，该国北部遭受饥荒时，那景象超乎想象。仿佛是末日降临，一个核浩劫后的世界。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I arrived in Ethiopia in 1984 and northern part of the country hit by famine, it was just beyond imagining. It was like apocalypse, a world after a nuclear holocaust.</p>
</details>

地平线上弥漫着尘埃，街道两旁躺着尸体，正如我当时报道的那样。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dust clouds across the horizon, the bodies along the streets, as I think I reported.</p>
</details>

饥荒沿着每一条道路蔓延，在每个城镇的门口都有成千上万的人。农民们正在逃离记忆中最严重的干旱。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Famine is along each road and at the gates of every town by the hundreds of thousands. Peasants are fleeing the worst drought in memory.</p>
</details>

支撑您继续前进的是一种感觉，那就是，你知道，这件事被世界所忽视。我们之所以在那里，是因为我们通过BBC争取到了签证。我们是整个饥荒地区仅有的两个新闻团队，我们需要向世界发出警报。这就是支撑我们前进的动力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What kept you going was the feeling that, you know, this was hidden from the world. We were there because we fought our way in with the BBC to get visas. We were the only two crews in the whole famine area, and we needed to alert the world. And that's what kept us going.</p>
</details>

之后，其他事情也支撑着我们，比如希望看到饥荒结束，以及希望看到社会从饥荒中恢复过来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And afterwards other things kept us going, like a desire to see the famine ended and the desire to see that society recover from famine.</p>
</details>

请您讲讲一位您仍然保持联系的、您在埃塞俄比亚遇到的、人们在您的故事和报道中真正产生共鸣的特定人物好吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me about one particular person that is still someone that you keep in touch with, that you met in Ethiopia, that people really connect with in terms of your story and your coverage?</p>
</details>

是的。她的名字叫Birhan Woldu，我第一次见到她时，她才三岁半。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Her name is Birhan Woldu, and I saw her first when she was three and a half years old.</p>
</details>

我当时在一个喂养中心，就在外面，那是最糟糕的饥荒营地之一，试图喂养那些带着年幼子女的父母，孩子们奄奄一息或已经死去，或者以某种方式拯救他们。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was at a feeding centre right outside, one of the worst famine camps, trying to feed these mothers and fathers with young children who were dying or already dead, or save them in some way or another.</p>
</details>

我正走过他们中间，看到一个女孩瘫倒在路面上，几乎要倒下。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was going down a line of them, and I saw this girl slumped over and collapse on the pavement.</p>
</details>

我不知道，她脸上的某种神情，或者说那种濒死的迹象，让我呼唤了一位护士，我说，护士，我们能救这个女孩吗？我们能做些什么吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know, something about her face, or just something about the nearness of that appeared to me dying sequence that I called out to a nurse and said, nurse, can we possibly save this girl? Is there anything we can do?</p>
</details>

护士向前跑去，抱起她，跑进我们跟随的那个单间医疗中心，摄像机记录着她脸上我们以为可能是最后的喘息。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The nurse runs forward, picks her up, runs inside the one room medical centre we follow with the crew rolling and capture on her face what we thought might be the last gasps of life.</p>
</details>

那张脸，望向外面，在我看来象征着埃塞俄比亚本身，它在一个不健康的世界上，乞求帮助，呼唤援助。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The face, looking outward seemed to me a symbol, really, of Ethiopia itself looking on a unhealthy world, begging for help kind of stuff, calling for help.</p>
</details>

护士对我们说，恐怕我们无能为力了。她将在15分钟内死去。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the nurse says to us, I'm afraid there's not anything we can do. She's going to die within 15 minutes.</p>
</details>

这让我们所有人都心力交瘁。我们走出房间，让她安详地离去。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it just devastated all of us. And we walked, went outside the room to let her die in peace.</p>
</details>

后来我们安排回来参加她的葬礼。那天下午，我们去报道了其他饥荒故事。下午回来时，我们去报道Birhan Woldu的葬礼，也许会做一个关于这件事的故事。我们看到一群人抱着那个女孩。她就在他们怀里，而且她还活着。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We later were arranged to come back to see her burial. That afternoon we went out and did other famine stories. Come back that afternoon to cover the burial of Birhan Woldu and do a story maybe about that. And we see this group of people holding the girl. She's there in her arms and she's alive.</p>
</details>

我对一位护士说，护士，我们今天似乎看到了一点奇迹，是吗？她说，是的。我们给她打了一针，她现在会爱了。她会活下来的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I say to a nurse, nurse, we seem to have seen a bit of a miracle today, did we? And she said, yes. We stuck a needle in her, and she she will love now. She will survive.</p>
</details>

我至今仍记得那一刻。后来我们报道了她的脸，以及埃塞俄比亚的象征意义和这个故事，看看她能否生存下来。也许埃塞俄比亚本身也能在后来生存下来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I still remember that. So we later did a story on her face and the symbolic of Ethiopia and the story, seeing if she can survive. Maybe Ethiopia itself can survive later.</p>
</details>

几个月后的Live Aid（救助生命）慈善演唱会使用了她的一张脸部照片，以及CBC拍摄的其他饥荒中病重儿童的照片，这在全世界引发了巨大的悲痛和泪水。当时有11亿观众。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Live Aid, months later uses an image of her face and the pictures CBC pictures of other desperately ill children in the famine and that caused such a pouring of grief and tears around the world. Before an audience of 1.1 billion people.</p>
</details>

据Live Aid的组织者Bob Geldof说，那是有史以来最伟大的、也是整个演出中最重要的捐赠时刻，他们为此演出了四次。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm imaginable that it was the greatest, according to Bob Geldof, who arranged Live Aid was the biggest moment of giving that the whole show had, and they ran it for four times.</p>
</details>

几年后，我回去查阅关于她的纪录片，因为她一度失踪了。我们找到了她，为她拍摄了纪录片，她还出现在了第二次Live Aid和与麦当娜同台跳舞的节目中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I went back to documentaries around her years later because she'd been lost. We found her, did documentaries on her, and she appeared in the second Live Aid and Dancing with Madonna on stage.</p>
</details>

她是一个非常非常虔诚的基督徒。当我们第一次告诉她她将与麦当娜同台时，她说麦当娜很奇怪。我觉得这有点奇怪。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She's very, very Christian girl. And when we first said she was going to appear with Madonna, she said she was really weird. I thought that was a bit weird.</p>
</details>

总之，我们曾一起上过奥普拉的节目。长话短说，她曾在这里度假。我为她和她的家人安排了生活和教育，现在我们两家人经常视频联系。她在埃塞俄比亚北部建立了一个小型慈善机构，专门帮助最贫困地区的残疾儿童。她希望留在那里帮助她的人民。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyways, we were on Oprah together. Long story short, had her over here for a holiday. I arranged for her and her family, their living and her education and now we zoom back and forth our families. She has set up a a small charity in northern Ethiopia itself for disabled children in the very poorest of all areas. She wants to stay there and help her people.</p>
</details>

这些是我多年来保存的一些旧照片。回到过去，你知道，童年时的照片。但这些照片，这是我在埃塞俄比亚饥荒线上遇到Birhan时拍的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are some old pictures I kept through the years. Going back, you know, childhood ones. But these are that's me along the line in Ethiopia of the famine line where I met Birhan.</p>
</details>

好的。她在这张照片里吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Will do. Okay. Is she in this?</p>
</details>

她就在这张照片里。这就是她。这就是那个场景。那是她靠在水泥地上，在路面上。那是她悲痛欲绝的父亲。那是护士匆忙跑进来抱起她的样子。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She is in this. This is her. This is the scene. That's her slumped against the cement, this pavement. That's her father grieving over her. That's the nurse would just rushing in to pick her up this way.</p>
</details>

四年后回去找她。四年后，就在那里。很热。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Went back to find her four years later. Four years later, right. There outside there. Hot.</p>
</details>

我不得不想象，那个故事和那段关系，与您去过的所有其他地方和经历的故事相比，是独一无二的。您没有机会讲述那个完整的故事。我想那一定给您带来了沉重的负担。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to imagine that that story and that relationship is unique in comparison to all of the other places and stories that you've been. You don't get a chance to be able to tell that full circle story. And I imagine that that must weigh on you heavily.</p>
</details>

我知道在您的书中提到了‘道德伤害’。您能跟我们谈谈那方面吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know that in your book you talk about the moral injury. What what what can you tell us about that?</p>
</details>

### 道德伤害：记者职业的深层创伤

嗯，记者行业花了很长时间才真正认识到，作为一名职业目击者，一次又一次地目睹惨状并同时面对危险所带来的心理和情感创伤，而这些危险又是那种生活的重要组成部分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it was a long time for journalism to really realise the psychological and emotional damage of being this professional witness over and over again and also facing dangers, which is so much a part of that life.</p>
</details>

直到90年代，新闻界才发现创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）正在侵蚀着从业者。后来发现还有另一种情况叫做‘道德伤害’（moral injury），它不是一种心理疾病，而是一种情感上的创伤。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It wasn't really until the '90s that journalism discovered that PTSD was ravaging the ranks. It turned out later there was another thing called moral injury, which is not a psychological mental illness. It's an emotional one.</p>
</details>

多伦多的一位著名精神病学家Anthony Feinstein将其称为‘灵魂的创伤’，‘精神的创伤’，即当你一次又一次地目睹类似事件发生时，即使你认为你的报道工作做得很好，很有用，并且你可以一遍又一遍地告诉自己，看，做得很好。我们当时在那里是好的。我们帮助了援助物资的运达。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Leading psychiatrist in Toronto, Anthony Feinstein, as termed that, wound to the soul, a wound of the spirit that when you watch things like that happen over and over again, even though you may be doing wonderful work in terms of a report that does useful stuff and you can tell yourself a hundred times over, look, it did well. It was good that we were there. We helped the aid arrive.</p>
</details>

但作为一个人，你仍然会觉得，你并没有完全达到自己最高的期望，因为那里有难民家庭。你没有停下来，把他们装上面包车带去医疗中心。你口袋里有一些东西，当时没有分发出去。还有其他人，即使你没有资格做任何事，就像我连急救资格都没有。我在饥荒中做什么？你总会觉得我本可以做得更多，我本可以做得更多。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You still feel that as a human being, you didn't quite live up to your highest expectations of yourself because there were refugee families. You didn't stop and load into your van and drive off with for a medical centre. There was something in your pocket you didn't hand out at a given time. There were other people, even though you were not qualified to do anything, as I was not qualified to even give first aid. What was I doing in a famine? You kind of feel I could have done more, I could have done more.</p>
</details>

多年来，这些感受开始累积，直到出现非常类似于PTSD的症状。事实上，我曾因此患上神经衰弱，并成功接受了‘道德伤害’的治疗。所以，我很庆幸地说，从那时起，我过上了非常美好的生活。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that begins over the years to build to the point where you have symptoms very like PTSD. And I had, in fact, a nervous breakdown caused by this and was treated for moral injury successfully. So I'm glad to say so. I've lived a very good life since that.</p>
</details>

### 新闻业的衰落及其对民主的影响

这并非秘密，也是您在CBC、NBC以及之后职业生涯中一直谈论的问题。新闻编辑部不像过去那样拥有资源了，我很好奇，当我们失去像您这样的外国记者在实地报道、让世界看到真相的特权时，民主会发生什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is no secret, and it's something that you talk about through your time at CBC, NBC and then back. Newsrooms don't have the resources that they once did, and I am curious what happens to democracy when we lose the privilege of someone like you in the field of foreign correspondent reporting for the world to see?</p>
</details>

我认为这对媒体来说是一个严重的损失，尤其是。而且，你知道，加拿大不像过去那样拥有同等的んですね。它是一个甚至没有自己海外情报部门的国家。像我们这样规模的大多数工业化国家，内阁似乎常常对世界其他地方和新闻业漠不关心。我们已经大大削减了海外报道的队伍。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a serious loss for particularly the media. But also, you know, Canada is a country that doesn't have the same kind of diplomatic corps it used to have. It's a country that chose not to even have an overseas intelligence service of its own. Like most industrial powers of our size, cabinet often seems out to lunch on the rest of the world and journalism. We've just decimated the ranks of our overseas coverage.</p>
</details>

所以我们只能获取其他人的报道。我们没有加拿大的眼睛和耳朵在那里寻找我们国家需要了解的角度。我认为，主要的网络，私人网络，坦率地说，做得非常糟糕，几乎取消了自己分支机构和记者的海外新闻报道。而CBC则勉强维持着一个桥梁。所以它仍在运作，但影响力大大降低了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we get stories from other people. We don't have Canadian eyes and ears out there looking for angles that we as a country need to be informed about. And I think the main networks, the private networks have done, I'll be quite frank and horrible job at virtually eliminating foreign news coverage by their own bureaus and reporters. And the CBC has held a held a sort of bridge. So it's still functioning, but with a much lower impact.</p>
</details>

结果就是，在新闻事件层出不穷、24/7不间断、危机接踵而至的时候，我们却派出了更少的记者去完成工作，而新闻的碎片化使得在那里开展工作变得更加困难。所以我希望这个国家能达到一个认识到我们需要开始重建我们的海外媒体来源的阶段，就像我们需要重建我们的外交来源以及海外经济来源一样。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what happens is we have fewer reporters out there doing the job at a time when there's more stories breaking all the time, the vortex of news that goes on 24 over seven, over and over, crisis upon crisis, upon crisis, and the fragmentation of news makes it very much harder to do the job out there. So I'm hoping that this country gets to a part where it realises we have got to start rebuilding our foreign media sources overseas, the same way we have to rebuild our diplomatic sources as well, and our economic sources overseas.</p>
</details>
