### 明尼苏达州起诉联邦政府

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是1月13日，星期二。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, January 13th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 数千名全副武装的国土安全部（**DHS**）特工被部署到明尼苏达州，这已对我们州造成了严重损害。这本质上是对双子城（Twin Cities）的联邦入侵，必须停止。明尼苏达州政府正在就特朗普政府大规模部署移民及海关执法局（**ICE**）特工一事提起诉讼，声称此举侵犯了**美国宪法**并损害了州的权利。此前，特朗普政府已宣布将再向该州增派1000名移民官员，而此前已有约2000名联邦特工在那里。该诉讼要求联邦法官阻止这些部署。明尼苏达州总检察长**Keith Ellison**表示，即使在上周**Renee Good**被一名ICE特工杀死加剧了当地紧张局势之前，居民们也早已遭受了种族貌相、骚扰、恐吓和殴打。学校已进入封锁状态，一些零售店、日托中心和餐馆实际上已经关闭，因为人们害怕外出购物，无论他们是移民还是已有多代居住的公民。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: The deployment of thousands of armed mass DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is in essence a federal invasion of the Twin Cities, and it must stop. The state of Minnesota is suing the Trump administration over the mass deployment of ICE agents there, claiming it has violated the US Constitution and infringed on the state's rights. It comes as the administration has announced it's sending 1,000 more immigration officers to the state on top of the roughly 2,000 other federal agents who are already there. The lawsuit asks the federal judge to block the deployments. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said that even before the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week escalated tensions there. Residents had already been racially profiled, harassed, terrorized, and assaulted. Schools have gone onto lockdown and some retail stores, daycarees, and restaurants have actually closed because people are afraid to go out and to do their shopping. Whether they're immigrants or whether they are citizens of many generations.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 在过去的这个月里，双子城各处，全副武装的特工们穿梭于公寓楼，要求查看证件并给人们戴上手铐。他们在工地针对建筑工人，并在市中心附近袭击了一名正在午休的男子，该男子反复尖叫自己是美国公民。特朗普政府最初在明尼苏达州发起广泛的执法行动，是为了在一次重大的福利欺诈丑闻中打击无证件的索马里移民。政府表示，新的增援是必要的，以确保特工能够安全地开展工作。在另一项独立的诉讼中，伊利诺伊州也于昨天就其ICE部署问题起诉了该政府，称联邦特工“制造了恐惧气氛”。**美国国土安全部**的一位女发言人称该诉讼“毫无根据”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: Over the last month, across the Twin Cities, armed agents have marched through apartment complexes demanding to see documents and handcuffing people. They've targeted construction workers at job sites and tackled a man on his lunch break near downtown as he repeatedly screamed he was a US citizen. The Trump administration initially launched its widespread enforcement operation in Minnesota to target undocumented Somali immigrants amid a major welfare fraud scandal. It says the new surge is needed to allow agents to carry out their work safely. In a separate lawsuit, the state of Illinois also sued the administration yesterday over its ICE deployment there, saying the federal agents were quote imposing a climate of fear. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security called that suit baseless.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 与此同时，《纽约时报》获悉了关于**FBI**对**Renee Good**在明尼阿波利斯死亡事件的调查新细节。消息人士称，杀死她的联邦特工不太可能面临刑事指控。他们表示，调查人员一直在审查该特工的行为，以及Good可能与反对该政府移民镇压政策的活动团体之间的联系。这种关注似乎与特朗普总统的言论一致，他曾反复声称（尽管没有证据）反对他政策的抗议者是一个“阴险的暴力网络”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: Meanwhile, the Times has learned new details about the FBI investigation into Renee Good's death in Minneapolis. Sources say it seems increasingly unlikely that the federal agent who killed her will face criminal charges. They say investigators have been looking into the agents actions and into the connections Good might have had to activist groups opposed to the administration's immigration crackdown. That focus appears to be in line with comments President Trump has made in which he's repeatedly claimed without evidence that protesters opposed to his policies are part of a shadowy violent network.

### 华盛顿三则快讯

**新闻报道**: 现在，三则来自**华盛顿**的快速更新。今天上午，**最高法院**将审理两起涉及**跨性别运动员**的案件，这是该法院首次正式受理此类具体问题。这些案件将考验**西弗吉尼亚州**和**爱达荷州**州法律的合宪性，这些法律仅允许学生根据出生时的性别参与体育运动。尽管裁决可能对拥有类似法律的25个其他州产生影响。在法庭上，运动员的律师将主张这些法律违反了宪法的平等保护条款，而州和特朗普政府的律师则会辩称，跨性别女性运动员的参与破坏了多年来为增加女性在体育运动中机会所做的努力。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: Now, three quick updates from Washington. At the Supreme Court this morning, the justices will hear back-to-back cases involving transgender athletes. the first time the court has formally taken on that specific issue. The cases will test the constitutionality of state laws in West Virginia and Idaho that only allow students to participate in sports based on their sex assigned at birth. Though rulings could have implications for 25 other states with similar laws. At the court, lawyers for the athletes will make the case that the laws violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantee, while lawyers for the states and the Trump administration will argue that the participation of trans female athletes undermines the yearslong effort to increase opportunities for women in sports.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 此外，**环境保护局（EPA）**发生了一次重大转变。官员们计划彻底改革他们制定空气污染规则的方式。几十年来，EPA一直以计算其对人们健康影响的成本来证明清洁空气规则（如臭氧和细颗粒物）的合理性，并考虑诸如因哮喘发作而损失的工作日等因素。现在，在特朗普政府的领导下，该机构将只考虑企业遵守任何法规的成本。EPA表示，他们仍将考虑人类健康，即使它没有明确包含在其成本效益计算中，但这一变化可能会更容易废除来自发电厂和炼油厂等污染源的限制。

**News Report**: Also, in a seismic shift at the Environmental Protection Agency, officials plan to overhaul how they set rules on air pollution. For decades, the EPA justified clean air rules around ozone and fine particullet by calculating the cost of their impact on people's health, taking into account things like days of lost work to asthma attacks. Now, under the Trump administration, the agency will only take into account how much it would cost a business to follow any regulations. The EPA says it will still be considering human health, even if it's not explicitly in its costbenefit calculations, but the change could make it easier to repeal limits on pollutants from things like power plants and oil refineries.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 《纽约时报》还获悉，**美国**在9月份执行其首次针对载有涉嫌贩毒者的船只的打击行动时，使用了一架伪装成民用飞机的秘密飞机，并配备了隐藏的武器。特朗普声称美国正与贩毒集团进行武装冲突，以此作为打击行动的理由。但使用这种飞机可能构成战争罪。根据战争法，战斗人员禁止伪装成平民以欺骗对手放下戒备，这是一种被称为“诡计”（perfidy）的罪行。**美国军方**在最初的打击行动中还杀死了两名幸存者，军事法律专家称这可能构成另一项战争罪。白宫在一份声明中表示，此次打击“完全符合武装冲突法的规定”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: And the Times has learned that the US used a secret plane painted to look like a civilian aircraft and armed with hidden weapons when it carried out its first strike on a boat carrying alleged drug traffickers back in September. Trump has claimed the US is in an armed conflict with drug cartels, justifying the strikes. But use of that plane could constitute a war crime. Under the laws of war, combatants are prohibited from pretending to be civilians to trick adversaries into dropping their guard, a crime known as perod. The US military also killed two survivors of that initial strike in what military law experts say could be another war crime. In a statement, the White House said the strike was quote fully consistent with the law of armed conflict.

### 伊朗严酷镇压抗议

**新闻报道**: 在**伊朗**，目击者称政府正在残酷镇压席卷该国的抗议活动。当局在过去5天里关闭了互联网和许多电话线路，试图实施信息封锁。但《纽约时报》通过卫星互联网连接联系到了人们，他们描述了暴力场面。他们说，他们看到狙击手在德黑兰市中心的屋顶上向人群开枪，安全部队用机关枪扫射。医院工作人员说，抗议者身上带着颅骨骨折和枪伤。一个急诊室在一小时内收治了19名枪击伤者。一位商人告诉《纽约时报》：“我设法连接了几分钟，只是想说这里简直是血海。”一位伊朗政府官员表示，他看到一份内部报告，其中提到至少有3000名平民和安全部队人员死亡。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: In Iran, witnesses say the government is carrying out a brutal crackdown on the protests that have been rocking the country. Authorities there are spent the last 5 days shutting down the internet and many phone lines to try and impose an information blackout. But the Times has been able to reach people over satellite internet connections who describe scenes of intense violence. They said they've seen snipers on rooftops in downtown Tyrron shooting into crowds and security forces opening fire with machine guns. Hospital workers say protesters are coming in with skull fractures and gunshot wounds. One ER had 19 shooting victims in an hour. A businessman told the Times, "I managed to get connected for a few minutes just to say it's a blood bath here." One Iranian government official said he'd seen an internal report referring to at least 3,000 dead civilians and security forces.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 昨晚，尽管受到镇压，一大群人再次聚集在德黑兰。**BBC**捕捉到的画面显示，人们在背景的枪声中高喊“打倒独裁者”。伊朗官员开始声称，上个月底因经济问题爆发的抗议活动已被恐怖分子接管，他们指责**美国**和**以色列**煽动了动乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: Last night, undeterred by the crackdown, a large crowd gathered in Thrron once again. Footage from the BBC captured people chanting death to the dictator with gunfire in the background. Iranian officials have started claiming that the protests which began late last month over economic wos have been taken over by terrorists and they are blaming the US and Israel for fueling the unrest.

### 家庭健康检测兴起

**新闻报道**: 在**美国**，越来越多的健康和保健公司正在推出一项新的宣传。他们声称可以检测你的血液。他们将65种生物标志物的检测与……他们为人们提供无需医生就诊或转诊即可进行实验室检测的机会。对我来说，这感觉像是医疗的未来。他们的承诺各不相同。一些人说他们可以帮助早期发现癌症。另一些人说他们可以帮助找出难以确诊的病症的根源。在某些情况下，他们利用了人们对医疗保健系统日益增长的怀疑和不满。一家公司的网站甚至承诺：“被大多数人忽视，由我们检测。”一些接受过此类检测的人告诉《纽约时报》，他们是在与医生无法诊断或解决的疾病作斗争后被吸引来的。然而，一些医学专业人士担心，这些公司正在让患者接受他们不需要的昂贵检测，这可能导致假阳性，并带来不必要的后续检查或焦虑。虽然许多公司提供的居家检测与人们在医生办公室可能获得的检测相同，但有些公司做得更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Report**: It's a simple way to get a 360° set of tests at a low cost in the US. A growing number of health and wellness companies are making a new pitch. We can test your blood. We pair tests across 65 biomarkers with over they're offering people a chance at lab tests without any kind of doctor visit or referral. That to me feels like the future of healthcare. The promises vary. Some say they can help catch cancer early. Others say they can help identify the source of hard to pin down conditions. They're capitalizing in some cases on a growing skepticism of and frustration with the health care system. One company's website even promises, "Ignored by most, tested by us." Several people who have paid for these kinds of tests tell the Times they were drawn to them after struggling with illnesses their doctors were unable to diagnose or resolve. Some medical professionals, however, worry that the companies are subjecting patients to costly tests they don't need, which could result in false positives and lead to unnecessary follow-ups or anxiety. And while many of the athome tests these companies are offering are the same ones people might get at a doctor's office, some are going beyond that.

</details>

**新闻报道**: 一些公司正争相提供**自闭症**检测，声称他们可以通过一缕头发或母亲的血液来预测孩子患病的风险。虽然全国各地的学术研究实验室都在努力寻找可以预测的生物标志物，但这些检测的批评者认为它们不够可靠，不适合商业推广。他们说，结果可能会误导那些已经充斥着关于这种神经发育障碍的不正确或未经证实的信息的父母。

**News Report**: Some companies are rushing to offer tests for autism, claiming they can predict a child's risk of developing it using a strand of hair or a mother's blood. While academic research labs across the country are working to find biological markers that could predict that, critics of the tests say they are not reliable enough to be offered commercially. They say the results could mislead parents who are already inundated with incorrect or unverified information about the neurodedevelopmental disorder.

### 花滑选手与家庭悲剧

**新闻报道**: 最后，在短短几周内，**冬季奥运会**将在意大利北部拉开帷幕。在过去的几天里，美国花样滑冰队的阵容已经确定。男子队的一名选手是24岁的**Maxim Namov**。这将是他首次参加奥运会。对于花滑界来说，他的入围是一个激动人心的时刻。

**Maxim Namov**: Year after year, we talked about the Olympics. It means so much in our family. And it's what I've been thinking about since I've been 5 years old.

</details>

**Maxim Namov**: 在本周末比赛后，他举起了他父母的照片，他们的父母曾是著名的俄罗斯花滑选手，后来在美国成为教练。去年1月，他们乘坐的**美国航空**航班在华盛顿特区附近与一架军用直升机相撞，机上所有人员遇难。和许多遇难者一样，他们正从滑冰营回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maxim Namov**: After competing this weekend, he held up a picture of his parents who were famed Russian skaters and later became coaches in the US. Last January, they were on the American Airlines flight that collided with a military helicopter near DC, killing everyone on board. Like many of the victims, they were coming home from a skating camp.

</details>

**Maxim Namov**: 这对我来说意味着一切，我知道他们在上面看着，微笑着，很自豪。

<details>

**Maxim Namov**: Um, it means absolutely everything to me, and I know they're looking down, smiling, and proud.
