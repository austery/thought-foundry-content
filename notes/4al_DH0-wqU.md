### 特朗普国情咨文

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是《新闻头条》。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，2月25日，星期三。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, February 25th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**旁白**: 先生，总统先生，美利坚合众国总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.

</details>

**旁白**: **特朗普总统**昨晚发表了美国历史上**最长的国情咨文**，将国家描述为在他的领导下安全且蓬勃发展。今天，我们的边境是安全的。我们的精神得到了恢复。**通货膨胀**正在迅速下降。收入正在快速增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: President Trump delivered the longest State of the Union address in American history last night, describing the country as safe and booming under his leadership. Today, our border is secure. Our spirit is restored. Inflation is plummeting. Incomes are rising fast.

</details>

**旁白**: 它时长为1小时47分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: It clocked in at 1 hour and 47 minutes.

</details>

**旁白**: 我们的国家又在赢了。事实上，我们赢了太多，以至于我们真的不知道该怎么办。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Our country is winning again. In fact, we're winning so much that we really don't know what to do about it.

</details>

**旁白**: 整晚，特朗普都大量运用戏剧化手法，这是对他真人秀根源的回应。Alejandra，我很高兴地通知你，你叔叔不仅被释放了，而且他今晚就在这里。我们把他接来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Throughout the night, Trump leaned heavily into theatrics, a call back to his reality TV roots. Alejandra, I'm pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight. We brought him over.

</details>

**旁白**: 他安排了一位女士和她叔叔的重逢，她叔叔曾是**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**政权在**委内瑞拉**的囚犯。他惊喜地召来了一位去年在**华盛顿特区**被枪击的**国民警卫队**成员，并授予他一枚**紫心勋章**。他还让男子奥林匹克冰球队队员从他上方的阳台上出现，宣布他将授予守门员**总统自由勋章**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: He staged a reunion between a woman and her uncle, a former prisoner under Nicholas Maduro's regime in Venezuela. He surprised a National Guard member who was shot in DC last year with a Purple Heart. and he had the men's Olympic hockey team emerge from the balcony above him, declaring he was giving the goalie the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

</details>

**旁白**: 你做得多么特别。你们是多么特别的冠军。非常感谢你们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: What a special job you did. What special champions you are. Thank you very much.

</details>

**旁白**: 政策方面，特朗普主要关注经济和移民。这些曾经是他擅长的议题，但民调显示，大多数美国人现在都以很大差距反对他处理这些问题的方式。但有一点是肯定的。我绝不允许世界头号恐怖主义赞助国，他们确实是，拥有核武器。不能让那种事情发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Policywise, Trump mostly focused on the economy and immigration. Those used to be winning topics for him, but polls show most Americans now disapprove by a wide margin of how he's handling them. But one thing is certain. I will never allow the world's number one sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon. Can't let that happen.

</details>

**旁白**: 总统用了大约90分钟的演讲才谈到**伊朗**，这是世界许多人急切想听到的议题，因为他曾威胁要对伊朗发动军事打击。然而，特朗普只花了大约三分钟谈论此事，然后就继续往下讲，几乎没有解释他为何下令自**伊拉克**入侵以来最大规模地增兵**中东**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: It took the president about 90 minutes into the speech to get to Iran, the topic much of the world was eager to hear about since he has threatened military strikes there. Trump only spent about three minutes talking about it, though, and moved on with little explanation of why he's ordered the largest buildup of US military firepower in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq.

</details>

**旁白**: 总的来说，这次演讲发生在特朗普的关键时刻。他的支持率是他重新执政以来最低的，而且在全国范围内，他的党派正在为即将到来的中期选举中可能出现的重大损失做准备，这可能会使特朗普更难推行他的议程。面对这种可能性，特朗普在晚上的多次机会中抨击**民主党人**，称他们“疯狂”且“反美”，并指责他们优先考虑**无证移民**而非美国公民。总统是在为你们工作吗？与此同时，在特朗普的演讲之后，总统是在努力让你们和你们的家人生活得更负担得起吗？**弗吉尼亚州**州长**阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格**发表了**民主党**的**反驳**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Overall, the speech came at a critical moment for Trump. His popularity is the lowest it's been since he retook office, and nationwide, his party is bracing for potentially significant losses in the upcoming midterms, which could make it harder for Trump to enact his agenda. Facing that possibility, Trump took multiple opportunities throughout the night to attack Democrats, calling them crazy and anti-American and accusing them of prioritizing undocumented immigrants over US citizens. Is the president working for you? Meanwhile, after Trump's speech, is the president working to make life more affordable for you and your family? The governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, gave the Democratic Party's rebuttal.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 他在充实自己、家人和朋友的腰包。腐败的规模是前所未有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: He's enriching himself, his family, his friends. The scale of the corruption is unprecedented.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 斯潘伯格认为特朗普损害了经济，用他的政策制造了混乱，并从他的总统任期中个人获益。这是民主党希望在今年秋天引起选民共鸣的信息的预演。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: Spanberger argued that Trump has hurt the economy, sowed chaos with his policies, and personally benefited from his presidency. It was a preview of the messaging Democrats hope will resonate with voters this fall.

</details>

### 埃普斯坦案件余波

**旁白**: 本周，一系列新的辞职和指控源自**埃普斯坦**的文件。自上个月**司法部**发布最新一批文件以来，与这位被定罪的性犯罪者有关联的知名人士的网络逐渐清晰，其中一些人正面临新的后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: This week, there's been a fresh series of resignations and allegations stemming from the Epstein files. Since the latest batch of documents was released by the Justice Department last month, the web of prominent people connected to the convicted sex offender has come into clearer view, and a number of them are facing new consequences.

</details>

**旁白**: 在**英国**，该国一位最知名的政治人物**彼得·曼德尔森**因涉嫌与埃普斯坦分享政府信息而被捕。曼德尔森去年因与埃普斯坦的深厚友谊公开后，被解除了担任**美国**大使的职务，但随着最新文件似乎显示他传递了潜在的机密政府文件，对他的审查一直在加强。曼德尔森尚未被起诉，已获保释。他此前曾表示，埃普斯坦的文件并未显示他有任何不当行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: In the UK, one of the country's best known political figures, Peter Mandlesson, was arrested on suspicion that he shared government information with Epstein. Mandlesson was fired from his role as ambassador to the US last year when the depth of his friendship with Epste became public, but scrutiny of him has been growing since the latest files appear to show that he passed along potentially confidential government documents. Mandlesson has not yet been charged with a crime and has been released on bail. He previously said that the Epstein files don't show any wrongdoing on his part.

</details>

**旁白**: 与此同时，在美国，备受瞩目的健康影响者**彼得·阿蒂亚**已辞去他在**CBS新闻**的撰稿人职务。他还辞去了一家蛋白棒公司的高管职位。文件显示，在埃普斯坦承认涉及未成年人的卖淫指控多年后，阿蒂亚和埃普斯坦开始见面并互相写信。在一封信中，阿蒂亚表示他希望他能告诉更多人关于他所称的埃普斯坦“极其放纵的生活”。他还恳求埃普斯坦遵循他的医疗建议，以便他能“跟上那些23岁的漂亮女孩”。在本月早些时候的一篇社交媒体帖子中，阿蒂亚表示他对那段通信感到羞耻，并且不知道埃普斯坦的贩卖妇女和虐待妇女或未成年女孩的行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: At the same time, in the US, the high-profile health influencer Peter Atia has resigned from his position as a contributor to CBS News. He's also stepped down from a top job at a protein bar company. The files showed that Atia and Epstein started meeting up and writing to each other years after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges involving a minor. In one note, Atia said he wished he could tell more people about what he called Epstein's outrageous life. And he also begged Epstein to follow his medical recommendations so that he could quote keep up with the 23-year-old beauties. In a social media post earlier this month, Atia said he was ashamed of that correspondence and did not know about Epstein's trafficking and abuse of women or underage girls.

</details>

**旁白**: 并且在**哥伦比亚大学**，一所旗舰科学研究所的诺贝尔奖得主联合主任昨天宣布他将辞职。**理查德·阿克塞尔**并未被指控任何不当行为，但文件记录了他与埃普斯坦多年的联系，包括他曾是埃普斯坦在**曼哈顿**的常客，并且他是埃普斯坦与哥伦比亚大学招生和筹款人员之间的中间人。这只是文件中的一个例子，说明埃普斯坦如何将自己与一些国家最负盛名的大学和著名学者联系起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: And at Columbia University, the Nobel Prizewinning co-director of a flagship scientific institute announced yesterday that he's resigning. Richard Axel is not accused of any wrongdoing, but the files document his yearslong connection with Epstein, including the fact that he was a frequent guest at Epstein's Manhattan home, and that he was a middleman between Epstein and Colombia's admissions and fundraising staff. It's just one example in the files of how Epstein tied himself to some of the country's most prestigious universities and celebrated academics.

</details>

### 俄乌战争进展

**旁白**: 四年前的本周，**俄罗斯**军队、飞机和坦克越过边境进入**乌克兰**，发动了**全面入侵**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Four years ago this week, Russian troops, planes, and tanks crossed the border into Ukraine, kicking off a fullcale invasion.

</details>

**旁白**: 这些你们可以看到的部队，他们是俄罗斯空降部队。现在，经过多年的残酷战斗，双方在战场和持续的和平谈判中实际上陷入了僵局。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: These troops you can see over here, they are Russian airborne forces. Now, after years of brutal fighting, the two sides are effectively deadlocked on the battlefield and in ongoing peace talks.

</details>

**旁白**: 在**特朗普政府**斡旋的谈判中，乌克兰基本上被提供一项交易：以和平换取允许俄罗斯保留其已占领的20%的乌克兰领土。俄罗斯还要求占领整个**顿涅茨克**地区，其中一些地区尚未完全控制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: In the negotiations brokered by the Trump administration, Ukraine is basically being offered a trade peace in exchange for letting Russia keep the 20% of Ukrainian territory that it's managed to seize. Russia is also demanding the entirety of the Daetsk region, some of which it hasn't taken control of yet.

</details>

**旁白**: 虽然一些因近乎每天的袭击而疲惫不堪的乌克兰人愿意接受这种交易，但对于生活在该地区的人们来说，情况要复杂得多。我的同事们最近前往那里，与那些身处困境的居民进行了交谈。顿涅茨克的大部分地区已被摧毁，但他们说，距离前线仅几英里的**斯洛维扬斯克**市，却是一种诡异的绿洲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: While some Ukrainians worn down by near daily attacks are open to that kind of deal, it's much more complicated for the people who live in the region in question. My colleagues recently traveled there to talk to the residents who are caught in the middle. Much of Donetsk has been destroyed, but they say the city of Slovian, just miles from the front lines, is kind of an eerie oasis.

</details>

**旁白**: 即使有持续不断的远处爆炸声，一家保龄球馆仍在营业，咖啡馆和普拉提课程也生意兴隆。**《纽约时报》**采访了一位在那里开了两年的发廊的女士。这是她的梦想事业，但她说，如果乌克兰同意将她所在城市的控制权交给俄罗斯，她就会离开。这是多年战争后，一个痛苦的选择。另一位居民告诉《纽约时报》，她和仍然住在那里的其他人感到无能为力，他们唯一能做的就是“希望我们不会被交给俄罗斯”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Even with a constant soundtrack of distant explosions, a bowling alley is still open for business and there are bustling coffee shops and Pilates classes. The Times spoke with one woman who opened a hair salon there two years ago. It's her dream business, but she said if Ukraine agrees to turn over control of her city to Russia, then she will leave. It's an agonizing choice after sticking it out through years of war. Another resident told the Times she and the other people still living there feel powerless and that all they can do is quote hope we will not be given to Russia.

### 格思里案百万悬赏

**Savannah Guthrie**: 大家好。我来是想说，这是我妈妈被从睡梦中带走后的第24天，是在深夜从她的床上被带走的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Savannah Guthrie**: Hi there. I'm coming on to say it is day 24 since our mom was taken in the dark of night from her bed.

</details>

**旁白**: 在一段新视频中，**《今日秀》**的主持人之一**萨凡纳·格思里**宣布，她的家人将提供高达**100万美元**的悬赏，以换取能找到她母亲**南希**的信息，南希在**图森**郊外的家中被绑架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: In a new video, Savannah Guthrie, one of the hosts of the Today Show, announced that her family is offering up to $1 million for information that leads to the return of her mother, Nancy, who was abducted from her home outside Tucson.

</details>

**Savannah Guthrie**: 如果你一直在等待，并且不确定，那就让这成为你的信号，请站出来，说出你知道的一切，帮助我们将我们挚爱的母亲带回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Savannah Guthrie**: If you've been waiting and you haven't been sure, let this be your sign to please come forward, tell what you know, and help us bring our beloved mom home.

</details>

**旁白**: 在南希·格思里失踪的几周内，当局表示，当地**治安官部门**和**FBI**的数百名调查人员已被分配到此案，他们一直在筛选数万条线索。但到目前为止，还没有取得突破。在视频中，格思里承认，她84岁的母亲可能已经不在人世了。格思里家新的百万美元悬赏，是继**FBI**提供的另一笔10万美元悬赏和一家亚利桑那州的犯罪热线提供的10万美元悬赏之外的。在昨天发布的视频中，格思里说，她的家人还向**失踪和被剥削儿童全国中心**捐赠了50万美元，他们希望他们案件的强烈关注也能引起对其他没有名人联系的失踪人员的更多关注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: In the weeks since Nancy Guthrie went missing, authorities say that hundreds of investigators from the local sheriff's department and the FBI have been assigned to the case, and they've been sifting through tens of thousands of tips. But so far, there has been no breakthrough. And in the video, Guthrie acknowledged that her mother, who's 84 years old, may no longer be alive. The Guthri's new million-doll offer is in addition to two other $100,000 rewards, one from the FBI and another from an Arizona based crime hotline. In the video posted yesterday, Guthrie said her family is also donating $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and that they hope the intense focus on their case might also bring more attention to other missing people who don't have a celebrity connection.

### 学校手机管理新方案

**旁白**: 最后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: And finally,

</details>

**旁白**: 学校刚开学，最糟糕的事情就发生了。我得到了一个**Yonder pouch**。它基本上是用磁铁把你的手机锁起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: school just started and the worst thing possible just happened. I got a yonder pouch. It basically locks your phone in with a magnet.

</details>

**旁白**: 全国范围内，**超过30个州**要求学校禁止或限制学生使用手机。而**Yonder**公司已将其定位为一种解决方案。Yonder生产的那种小袋子，你可能在音乐会、演出或教室里被要求把手机放进去。其卖点是，一旦手机放进去，袋子就会屏蔽手机信号，并且没有特殊设备就无法解锁。据该公司称，每天有300万学生使用这些袋子。根据追踪地方政府支出的数据库，去年仅Yonder就向学校销售了至少**1900万美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Across the country, more than 30 states require school districts to ban or restrict students access to their cell phones. And the company Yonder has built itself as a solution. Yonder makes those little pouches that you may have been asked to tuck your phone into at a concert or a show or a classroom. The pitch goes that once it's in there, the pouch blocks phone signals and it can't be unlocked without a special device. According to the company, 3 million students use the pouches daily. And according to a database that tracks local government spending, Yonder made at least $19 million in sales to schools last year alone.

</details>

**旁白**: 但是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: But

</details>

**旁白**: 嘿，伙计们，今天我要向你们展示如何打开一个锁着的Yonder pouch。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: what's up guys? Today I'm going to show you guys how to open up a lock yonder pouch.

</details>

**旁白**: 事实证明，那些袋子对孩子们来说不堪一击。首先我试着把它砸了一下，没用。所以我更用力地砸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: It turns out those pouches are no match for kids. At first I tried banging it and that didn't work. So I banged it harder.

</details>

**旁白**: 一些学生说，他们发现如果以正确的角度将袋子猛击在坚硬的表面上，它们就会弹开。其中一些学生甚至更有创意。他们根本不把手机放进袋子里。他们只是放一个诱饵设备进去，或者甚至是一块重石头。然后还有那些想出了你可以从**亚马逊**上买个磁铁来解锁它们的孩子的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Some students say they found that if you whack the pouches against a hard surface at just the right angle, they spring open. Some of them are even craftier. They don't put their phones into the pouches at all. They just tuck a decoy device in or even a heavy rock. And then there's the kids who figured out you could potentially buy a magnet off Amazon to unlock them.

</details>

**旁白**: 考虑到孩子们总会找到解决办法的现实，一些教育工作者告诉《纽约时报》，他们选择了一种更低技术的方法，比如让每个人把手机放在教室前面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Given the reality that kids just will figure out a solution, some educators told the Times they opt for a more lowfi approach, like just making everyone leave their phone at the front of the class.

</details>

**旁白**: 以上是新闻头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。明天再见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow.
