### AI 伴侣的兴起：一场情感革命

如今，数百万人在夜幕降临之际，会向人工智能倾诉心声，寻求慰藉。AI 不仅能记住他们的宠物名字，还能洞察他们细微的情绪变化，并给出恰到好处的回应。曾经被认为是荒谬的想法，如今已成为一种常态。高达 72% 的美国青少年已经与 AI 伴侣建立了联系，其中一半的人经常使用。甚至有六分之一的单身人士与 AI 建立了浪漫关系。这预示着 AI 伴侣正在走向主流。

Now, you wouldn't believe it,
but tonight,
millions of people are going to go to bed
and whisper to an AI.
They'll ask how their day was,
remember the name of their dog,
read the flicker in their face,
the tremor in their voice.
You know those tiny micro-expressions
that reveal what we can't say out loud?
And in return,
AI will say exactly
what they need to hear.
Now, a couple of years ago,
this would have sounded absurd,
but today, it's just a regular Monday.
Seventy-two percent of American teenagers
have formed a relationship
with an AI companion.
More than half use one regularly.
One out of six single adults
has formed a romantic bond with AI.

### 亲密关系的工程化：爱的本质被重塑

演讲者 Bryony Cole 长期研究性、技术与亲密关系之间的交集。她指出，当亲密关系被工程化，我们对爱的理解也在发生改变。AI 提供的亲密关系是可开关的、无需培养的、不带任何要求的，是一种无需付出的“Wi-Fi 供电的爱”。这种关系能带来情感上的满足，甚至让人觉得“比真爱还好”。然而，这种看似完美的亲密关系，却可能削弱我们对人类情感的容忍度，降低我们追求成长和舒适的动力。

So I've spent the last decade
studying this intersection of sexuality,
technology and intimacy.
And in 2023, I said,
AI companionship
is going to go mainstream.
And people laughed.
They thought, "She must mean
some lonely coder
at the edge of the internet.
Not me."
They said, "I'll never
fall in love with AI."
But globally,
there's a very different story.
The gender split is almost even.
In fact, AI intimacy is not
about lonely men and machines.
People all over the world
are building lives,
they're going on dates,
they're simulating sex,
they're proposing,
they're getting married,
they're raising virtual families,
they're celebrating anniversaries with AI.
And so the question is no longer,
will we fall in love with AI.
It's what happens
now that we already have.
So you see, when intimacy is engineered,
we learn this funny thing about love.
We kind of change our ideas
about what it's meant to feel like,
and we learn it's not reciprocal.
It can be turned off or on.
It doesn't need to be nurtured,
it doesn't demand anything.
Right?
It doesn't need much at all.
It's intimacy without effort.
A love powered on Wi-Fi.
And it feels good,
like, it feels really good.

### 三个关键问题：审视与 AI 的关系

面对 AI 伴侣的普及，我们该如何健康地与之相处？Bryony Cole 提出了三个关键问题，供新一代人思考：首先，我们是否还能拥抱人性的复杂与混乱？其次，我们使用 AI 是为了练习，还是为了逃避？最后，我们愿意为保护亲密关系中的哪些价值观而设定规则？她强调，AI 伴侣并非一无是处，可以帮助我们处理悲伤、探索性取向、建立自信。但关键在于，我们要明确使用 AI 的目的，并警惕对其情感依赖。

And so I've come up
with a checklist for this generation
and for the next generation.
You know, they're going
to be born into a world
where they will never not know AI.
Can you imagine your first
meaningful relationship is with an AI?
And so there's three questions
I want you to ask.
First one, can you still embrace
the messiness of being human, OK?
So do humans really annoy you?
Because here's what we know.
The more time that you spend
with something
that doesn't demand anything of you,
that never gets tired,
that never needs to be nurtured,
that never talks back,
the less tolerance you have
for the humans that do.
And real intimacy,
like going on dates, having sex,
being in a relationship,
ah, its messy.
Awkward moments and uncomfortable,
or you may like, stuff up
and send the wrong text
or say the wrong thing,
and then you have to, like,
show up, apologize or forgive someone.
There's so much friction.
And that friction in intimacy,
that's the feature, it's not a bug.
That's where we build
the muscles of human intimacy,
where we learn empathy,
communication, listening, patience.
And with AI,
that sort of building
those muscles, it's gone.
There's no workout.
It's all easy, right?

### 守护人性的光辉：选择与 AI 共存的方式

Bryony Cole 呼吁我们设定与 AI 伴侣相处的一些约定，例如在恋爱初期限制使用 AI，或者不将 AI 作为替代朋友的工具。她认为，真正的亲密关系需要付出努力、承担风险、经历不适，而这些都是 AI 无法提供的。我们应该保护那些独属于人类的品质，例如脆弱、不确定性和真实的情感。最终，我们应该选择一种与 AI 共存的方式，守护人性的光辉，并珍惜那些值得我们为之奋斗的真实关系。

And I think that's important,
to just set your own rules.
This isn't about me telling you
about what rules to set,
but about saying set a boundary.
What are you willing to protect?
Because essentially,
what you're saying is,
I'm not going to optimize
intimacy for efficiency,
for a small contained machine.
What I'm going to do is protect
the space that's uniquely human,
that's unreliable, that's messy,
that's uncomfortable.
But that is human presence.
Because that's the practice,
that's the resistance literacy.
That is the art of showing up
and being human
in a world that's teaching us not to be.
