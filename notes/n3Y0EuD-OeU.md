来自《纽约时报》的头条新闻。我是威尔·贾维斯，代班特蕾西·芒福德。今天是11月6日星期四。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

### 特朗普关税案在最高法院受审

首席大法官阁下，法庭诸位。4月2日，前总统特朗普认定，我们不断扩大的贸易逆差已将我们推向经济和国家安全灾难的边缘。昨天在**最高法院**（Supreme Court: 美国联邦司法系统的最高级别法院），大法官们审理了本期最重要的案件之一，他们听取了关于特朗普总统大范围使用**关税**（Tariffs: 一国对进口商品征收的税费）的辩论。该案的核心问题是，特朗普在使用一项已有数十年历史的法律对进入美国的商品征收全面附加费时，是否超越了他的职权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. On April 2nd, President Trump determined that our exploding trade deficits have brought us to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe. At the Supreme Court yesterday, the justices heard one of the most consequential cases of the term as they considered arguments about President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs. The question at the center of the case is whether Trump overstepped his authority when he used a decades-old law to impose sweeping surcharges on goods coming into the US.</p>
</details>

我想在这里做一个非常重要的区分。我们不认为这里行使的是征税权，而是监管对外贸易的权力。政府律师辩称，该法律赋予总统广泛权力来应对经济和国家安全威胁。过去的总统曾利用它来实施**制裁**（Sanctions: 对某国实施的经济或政治限制）或**禁运**（Embargos: 禁止与某国进行贸易）等措施。但特朗普是第一位将其用于关税的总统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to make a very important distinction here. We don't contend that what's being exercised here is the power to tax. It's the power to regulate foreign commerce. Lawyers for the government argued that the law gives the president broad authority to respond to economic and national security threats. Past presidents have used it to impose things like sanctions or embargos. But Trump is the first president to use it for tariffs.</p>
</details>

我就是不理解这个论点。这是国会的权力，而不是总统的征税权。你们想说关税不是税，但它们正是税。它们正在从美国公民那里产生收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just don't understand this argument. It's a congressional power, not a presidential power to tax. And you want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are. They're generating revenue from American citizens.</p>
</details>

法院的自由派大法官们对政府提出了尖锐质疑，保守派多数派的几位关键成员也加入了他们的行列，他们似乎对特朗普实施大范围关税的权力表示怀疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The court's liberal justices sharply questioned the administration, and they were joined by several key members of the conservative majority who seemed skeptical of Trump's authority to impose the widespread tariffs.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这些关税是普遍性的。所以，你们是否认为每个国家都因为对国防和工业基础的威胁而需要被征收关税？我的意思是，比如西班牙、法国……我能理解对某些国家这样做。在周三的听证会之前，特朗普总统表示该案件“对我们国家而言，简直是生死攸关”。特朗普的财政部长和商务部长也前往法庭旁听了辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, these are kind of across the board. And so, is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France... I could see it with some countries. Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, President Trump said the case was, quote, 'literally life or death for our country.' And Trump's Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary went to the courtroom to sit in on the arguments.</p>
</details>

该案的结果可能在数周或数月内决定。如果法院裁定政府败诉，政府可能被迫退还美国迄今已征收的数十亿美元关税收入中的部分或全部。尽管如此，贸易专家表示，总统未来仍有其他方式可以对进口商品征税，包括使用一些鲜为人知的法律条款。欲了解更多关于此次听证会及其对总统权力更广泛意义的影响，请收听今天《纽约时报》最高法院记者亚当·利普塔克在《The Daily》节目中的报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The outcome of the case could be decided in weeks or in months. If the court rules against the administration, the government could be forced to refund some or all of the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue so far. Still, trade experts say there are other ways that the president could tax imports going forward, including by using some obscure legal provisions. For more on the hearing and what it could mean for presidential power more broadly, listen to today's episode of The Daily with Times Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptac.</p>

### 政府停摆与空中交通限制

现在，关于特朗普政府的另外两条最新消息。我预计将会有更多的混乱。嗯，会有挫败感，但最终，我们唯一的职责是确保这个空域尽可能安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, two more updates on the Trump administration. I anticipate there will be additional disruptions. There will be frustration, but in the end, our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible.</p>
</details>

交通部长肖恩·达菲表示，如果**政府停摆**（Government Shutdown: 因国会未能通过预算案而导致政府非核心部门关闭）持续，联邦政府将从明天开始限制全国40个最繁忙机场的空中交通。新的限制措施可能导致数千次航班在一年中最繁忙的旅行季节被取消。达菲表示，此举将减轻**空中交通管制员**（Air Traffic Controllers: 负责指挥飞机起降和空中飞行的专业人员）的一些压力。他们已经数周未领到工资，且在停摆前，由于全国范围的人员短缺，许多人都在加班。空中交通管制员的缺勤已经导致了严重的延误。最近几周，达菲关于航空旅行中断日益严峻的警告带有明显的政治色彩，因为政府试图向民主党施压以结束停摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Transportation Secretary Shawn Duffy says that the federal government will limit air traffic at 40 of the country's busiest airports starting tomorrow if the government shutdown continues. The new limits could lead to thousands of flights being canceled going into the busiest travel season of the year. Duffy said the move would lift some pressure from air traffic controllers. They haven't been paid for weeks, and many were working overtime shifts before the shutdown due to staffing shortages across the country. Air traffic controller absences have already led to significant delays. In recent weeks, Duffy's increasingly dire warnings around disruptions to air travel have been notably political as the administration has tried to turn up pressure on Democrats to end the shutdown.</p>

### 移民拘留中心条件恶劣

此外，伊利诺伊州的一名联邦法官已命令移民官员改善芝加哥附近一处拘留中心的条件，他曾将这些条件描述为不必要的残酷。他表示，政府必须向被拘留者提供淋浴、清洁水和接触律师的权利等。该命令是在几名前被拘留者向法官讲述该地点肮脏不堪的条件后一天发出的，那里没有肥皂、没有床铺、垃圾遍地，有些人甚至睡在水泥地上。尽管该设施旨在用于短期拘留，但随着政府加大在芝加哥的移民打击力度，一些人已被关押在那里数日。**国土安全部**（Department of Homeland Security: 负责美国边境安全、移民和反恐的联邦机构）的一位发言人在一份声明中表示，被拘留者关于该中心条件恶劣的说法是“虚假的”。法官要求联邦官员在明天中午前提交一份关于其进展的报告。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Also, a federal judge in Illinois has ordered immigration officials to improve conditions at a detention center near Chicago, conditions he had described as unnecessarily cruel. He said the government must provide detainees with showers, clean water, and access to lawyers, among other things. The order came a day after several former detainees told the judge about the site's squalid conditions, with no soap, no beds, garbage everywhere, and some people sleeping on the concrete floor. While the facility was designed for short-term detention, some people have been locked up there for days as the administration has ramped up its immigration crackdown in Chicago. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said detainees' claims of poor conditions at the center are, quote, false. The judge gave federal officials until midday tomorrow to submit a report on their progress.</p>

### 墨西哥总统遭遇性骚扰事件

在墨西哥，总统克劳迪娅·谢因鲍姆表示，她已对一名在街上对她**性骚扰**（Sexual Harassment: 以性为目的的言语或身体冒犯）的男子提起刑事诉讼，这一事件被摄像机拍下，震惊了该国许多人。事件发生在周二。当时她在墨西哥城中部开会间隙步行，该男子走近她，试图亲吻她，并将手放在她的胸部。该男子已被逮捕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum says she's filed a criminal complaint against a man who groped her on the street, an incident that was caught on camera and shocked many in the country. It happened on Tuesday. She was walking between meetings in central Mexico City when the man approached her, moved to kiss her, and put his hands on her chest. He has since been arrested.</p>
</details>

在一次新闻发布会上，谢因鲍姆表示：“如果这种事能发生在总统身上，那么我们国家所有年轻女性和女性会遭遇什么？”谢因鲍姆是墨西哥首位女总统，她将结束对女性的暴力作为其竞选活动的核心。事件发生后，她表示将要求官员重新考虑**性骚扰**并非在所有墨西哥州甚至联邦层面都构成犯罪这一事实。这起备受关注的案件促使许多墨西哥女性反思，即使在白天公共场所行走时，被性骚扰是多么普遍。许多《纽约时报》采访的女性回忆说，她们尤其在公共交通工具上被不恰当地触摸。研究该国性别暴力的人士表示，谢因鲍姆选择发声并提出指控，是对现状的一次有意义的改变，其中一人表示：“这传递了一个重要信息，即这种暴力是完全真实的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking at a press conference, Sheinbaum said, 'If this can happen to the president, what's going to happen to all the young women and women across our country?' Sheinbaum is Mexico's first female president, and she made ending violence against women a centerpiece of her campaign. After the incident, she said she would ask officials to reconsider the fact that sexual harassment is not a a crime in all Mexican states or even a federal crime. The high-profile case has prompted many Mexican women to reflect on how common it is to be groped even while walking in public during the day. Many women the Times spoke with recalled being touched inappropriately on public transit in particular. People who studied gender-based violence in the country said Sheinbaum's decision to speak out and press charges was a meaningful change in the status quo, with one saying, quote, 'It sends an important message that such violence is completely real.'</p>

### 飓风梅丽莎与气候变化

今天上午发布的一项新分析发现，上周肆虐牙买加和加勒比部分地区的**飓风梅丽莎**（Hurricane Melissa）因**气候变化**（Climate Change: 由人类活动引起的全球气候模式长期变化）而变得更加猛烈和强烈。这些发现来自**世界天气归因组织**（World Weather Attribution: 一个研究化石燃料燃烧与极端天气之间联系的组织），该组织研究燃烧**化石燃料**（Fossil Fuels: 煤、石油、天然气等在地质历史中形成的燃料）与干旱、热浪和飓风等极端天气之间的联系。研究人员发现，梅丽莎的风力更强，产生的降雨量也比没有人为气候变化影响时显著增多。这部分是因为飓风从海洋热量中获取能量，而梅丽莎形成时加勒比海的水温升高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A new analysis released this morning found that Hurricane Melissa, which ravaged Jamaica and parts of the Caribbean last week, was made more violent and more intense by climate change. The findings come from World Weather Attribution, a group that looks at the links between burning fossil fuels and extreme weather like droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes. The researchers found that Melissa had stronger winds and produced significantly more rain than it would have had it happened without the impact of man-made climate change. That's partly because hurricanes draw energy from ocean heat, and water temperatures in the Caribbean were elevated when Melissa formed.</p>
</details>

与此同时，《纽约时报》记者一直在牙买加受灾最严重的地区之一——黑河镇进行实地报道。飓风摧毁了那里几乎所有的建筑。居民和第一响应者过去一周一直在努力启动恢复进程，尽管电力中断，电话服务也仍未恢复。一些人睡在车里。许多《纽约时报》采访的警察、消防员和医生表示，他们甚至还没有去检查自己的房屋，尽管他们认为已经一无所有。全国各地，当局仍在努力清理道路，并联系被困社区。这场风暴造成的死亡人数现已升至30多人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, Times reporters have been on the ground reporting from one of the hardest-hit parts of Jamaica, the town of Black River. The hurricane destroyed almost every single building there. Residents and first responders have spent the last week trying to begin the process of recovery, even as electricity is out and phone service is still down. Some people have been sleeping in cars. And many of the police, firefighters, and doctors that the Times talked with said they haven't even gone to check on their own houses yet, though they assume there's nothing left. Across the country, authorities are still working to clear roads and reach stranded communities. The death toll from the storm has now risen to more than 30 people.</p>

### 约会应用拥抱AI：机遇与挑战

最后，在过去几年里，**约会应用**（Dating Apps: 帮助用户寻找约会对象的手机应用程序）一直面临着他们所谓的**“绝望循环”**（Cycle of Despair: 指用户在约会应用上反复经历匹配、无回应或被“放鸽子”后删除应用又重装的循环）的困境。你下载一个应用，滑动匹配了很多人，然后却没有得到回应，或者**“被放鸽子”**（Ghosted: 指在约会或社交中突然中断联系，不再回应），于是删除了应用，几个月后又重新下载。这些问题严重损害了约会应用背后的公司。随着人们越来越不愿意为订阅付费，约会应用本身也难以盈利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally, in the past few years, dating apps have struggled with what they call the cycle of despair. You download an app, swipe on a bunch of matches, and then don't get responses or get ghosted and delete the app only to redownload it a few months later. These issues have really hurt the companies behind the dating apps. And as people are less willing to pay for subscriptions, the dating apps themselves are struggling to make money.</p>
</details>

所以现在他们正试图提出一项新计划来扭转业务，这其中就涉及到了**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机科学领域）。伊莱·谭是《纽约时报》的一名科技记者，一直在报道约会应用中的AI应用，从Tinder等顶级品牌到新兴的AI原生初创公司。他说，这些应用正在推出一系列工具。一个例子是，有一项**AI媒人**（AI Matchmaker: 基于人工智能，通过分析用户数据来推荐匹配对象的服务）服务，让你花大约半小时与一个**聊天机器人**（Chatbot: 模拟人类对话的人工智能程序）通话，它会询问你正在寻找什么样的人。然后，它会收取你25美元，为你提供一个据说非常匹配的定制对象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now they're trying to come up with a new plan to turn their businesses around, and that involves AI. Eli Tan is a technology reporter at The Times who's been covering the AI of dating apps, from top brands like Tinder to new AI-native startups. He says there's a whole range of tools the apps are rolling out. One example: there's an AI matchmaker service that has you spend about a half hour on a phone call with a chatbot that asks you questions about the kind of person you're looking for. It then charges you 25 bucks for a single custom match who's supposedly a great fit.</p>
</details>

还有Grindr这款应用，它有一个所谓的**AI僚机**（AI Wingman: 旨在提供对话建议和社交支持的人工智能工具），可以提供对话建议。而Hinge则允许你使用AI来审查你的个人资料，并就如何调整提供反馈。这些功能是否会流行起来还有待观察，但很多人已经开始使用它们。我采访过一个名叫艾玛的25岁旧金山女孩。她尝试了AI媒人服务，虽然她对约会感到紧张，但最终进展顺利。他们在酒吧里聊了几个小时，之后交换了联系方式，并表示期待第二次约会。但最终，他**“放了她鸽子”**（Ghosted: 指在约会或社交中突然中断联系，不再回应），再也没有回复她的短信。我认为这提醒我们，AI和算法对我们的约会生活能做的很有限。最终，仍然是两个人之间进行交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's also the app Grindr, which has what it calls an AI wingman that gives conversation advice. And Hinge lets you use AI to review your profile and give feedback about what to tweak. It's still yet to be seen if these features will catch on, but a lot of people are already turning to them. One person I talked to, named Emma, was a 25-year-old in San Francisco. She tried out the AI matchmaker, and she was nervous about the date, but it ended up going great. They talked for multiple hours at a bar, and afterwards they exchanged numbers and said they were looking forward to a second date. But in the end, he ghosted her and never texted her back. I think it's a reminder that the AI and the algorithms can only do so much for our dating lives. And in the end, it's still going to be two human beings that are talking to each other.</p>
