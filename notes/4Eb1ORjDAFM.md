### 特朗普与姆达尼的意外“和解”

好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘节目。我们今天提早开始，将直接关注姆达尼和特朗普的会面，之后我们会讨论市场上发生的一切。

<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are going to go live right to Manny and Trump and that's why we are early and uh then we will get into everything going on in the markets. Let's pull this up real quick and then we will get into these headlines.</p>
</details>

>> 即便是在第一任期，我也可以告诉你，我的一些观点已经改变了，我们对一些事情进行了讨论。我不会透露具体内容，但我非常有信心他能做得很好。我认为他会给一些保守派人士和一些非常自由派的人士带来惊喜。他不会让自由派惊讶，因为他们已经喜欢他了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Even the first term and I can tell you some of my views have changed and we we had discussions on some things. I'm not going to discuss what they were but that I feel very confident that he can do a very good job. I think I think he's going to be I think he is going to surprise some conservative people actually and some very liberal people. He won't surprise him because they already like him.</p>
</details>

>> 姆达尼先生，听起来你们的讨论很有成效，但就在几天前，你还称特朗普总统是一个出卖国家的人。你说你会成为他最可怕的噩梦，并指责他有法西斯议程。为了改善你们的关系，你打算撤回这些言论吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And uh Mr. month. Um, it sounds like you had a productive discussion, but just days ago, you referred to President Trump as a desperate who trade the country. You said you'd be his worst nightmare and accused him of having a fascist agenda. Um, are you planning to retract any of these remarks in order to improve your relationship?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为特朗普总统和我，我们都非常清楚自己的立场和观点。我真正欣赏总统的是，我们这次会议的重点不是分歧之处——分歧确实很多，而是我们为纽约市民服务的共同目标。坦率地说，这可以改变八百五十万人的生活，他们目前正生活在生活成本危机之下，四分之一的人生活在贫困中。会议一次又一次地回到如何让这些纽约人摆脱困境，开始为他们提供一个他们不仅能勉强负担得起，而且能真正开始生活的城市。而且，我被人叫过比这难听得多的话，所以这并不算什么侮辱。也许我们开始合作后，他会改变主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think both President Trump and I, we are very clear about our positions and our views. And what I really appreciate about the president is that the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers. And frankly, that is something that could transform the lives of eight and a half million people who are currently struggling under a cost of living crisis with one in four living in poverty. And the meeting came back again and again to what it could look like to lift those New Yorkers out of struggle and start to deliver them a city that they could do more than just struggle to afford it, but actually start to live in it. and I've been called much worse than it does bud. So it's not it's not that insulting. Maybe I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together. Yes, please.</p>
</details>

>> 总统先生，我是来自黎巴嫩MTV的安东尼·马什。我想问您一个关于中东的问题。您曾说过黎巴嫩的处境不佳，现在黎巴嫩是继加沙和叙利亚之后最后一个未解决的问题。根据您的评估，您今天想对黎巴嫩人说些什么？您下一步将采取什么行动来推动解除武装？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Mr. President Anthony Marsh from MTV Lebanon. I I would like to ask you a question about the Middle East regarding you did said that in Lebanon is not in a good position and Lebanon now is the final unresolved after Gaza and Syria. Given your assessment like what do you say for the Lebanese today? It's the independent stay in Lebanon. And what is your next move to push toward disarmment? The disarmment of</p>
</details>

>> 我们正在推动哈马斯以及坦率地说其他所有人的全面解除武装。我们在中东实际上已经实现了和平。如你所知，沙特阿拉伯国王昨天刚离开。我们进行了一些很棒的会谈，他为美国贡献了超过一万亿美元。我们现在有超过20万亿美元的资金流入。没有哪个国家曾有过这样的经历，差得远了。即使是两万亿或一万亿，也已经很多了。我们有20或21万亿美元。我认为真主党在黎巴嫩一直是个问题，一个大问题。我们正在与黎巴嫩合作，我们正在与中东的每一个人合作。这是我认为我们另一个共同点。我们都希望看到中东和平。实际上，我们现在3000年来首次在中东实现了和平。现在我们将进一步完善它。我认为你会看到一些非常积极的事情发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We are pushing for total disarmament of Hamas and frankly everybody else. And we actually have peace in the Middle East. As you know, the king of Saudi Arabia just left yesterday. We had some great meetings and he's uh made a contribution toward the United States of more than a trillion dollars. We have now over 20 trillion dollars coming into No Country has ever had anything like that. Not even close. If you go to two trillion or one trillion, it's a lot. We have 20 or 21 trillion dollars. U I think that uh Hezbollah has been a problem in Lebanon. Big problem. We're working with Lebanon. We're working with everybody in the Middle East. That's another thing I think we have in common. We want to see peace in the Middle East. And we actually have now for the first time peace in the Middle East after 3,000 years. And now we're going to refine it. And I think you're going to see some very positive things happen. the potential to invite the Lebanese president to meet you to the White House.</p>
</details>

>> 我会的，绝对会。如果市长愿意参加那次会议，因为我知道他对中东和平的立场非常坚定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I would I would do that. Absolutely. And if the mayor would like to be here for that meeting because I know he feels very strongly I think you feel very very strongly about peace in the Middle East.</p>
</details>

>> 我们迫切希望实现和平。这也是我与总统分享的一点。去年十一月，当我在希尔赛德大道与福特姆路与投票给总统的纽约人交谈时，我问他们为什么。我一次又一次地听到两个主要原因。一是他们希望结束永久的战争。他们希望我们纳税人的钱不再被用于资助侵犯人权的行为。二是他们希望解决生活成本危机。我很感激有机会讨论这两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We we we desperately want it and and that's something that I shared with the president that when I spoke to New Yorkers who had voted for the president last November on Hillside Avenue in Fortm Road, I asked them why. I heard again and again two major reasons. One was that they wanted an end to forever wars. They wanted an end to the taxpayer dollars we had funding violations of human rights and they wanted to address the cost of living crisis and I appreciated the chance to discuss both of those things.</p>
</details>

>> 总统先生，您曾威胁要向纽约市派遣联邦军队。在纽约市的**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）探员问题上，你们俩也存在分歧。姆达尼先生，您曾称ICE是一个流氓政府实体。我想知道你们如何调和在这两个问题上的分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, you've threatened to send federal troops to New York City. Uh you both have differences when it comes to ICE agents uh in New York City. Mr. Mdani, you've called ICE a rogue government entity. I wonder how you reconcile your differences on both of those issues.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我想我们会解决这些问题的。我认为，如果我们有已知的杀人犯、毒贩和一些非常坏的人，我们希望把他们赶出去。市长也希望和平。我们对此进行了深入的讨论，可能比任何其他问题都多。他希望有一个安全的纽约。最终，一个安全的纽约将是一个伟大的纽约。如果不安全，无论我们在物价或其他任何方面做得多好，都无济于事。如果你没有安全的街道，就不可能成功。所以，我们会合作。我们会确保如果那里有可怕的人，我们会把他们赶出去。我想他比我更想把他们赶出去。所以，我们会合作。我们对此进行了长时间的讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I think we're going to work them out and I think that uh if we have known murderers and known drug dealers and some very bad people, you know, we want to get them out. And the mayor wants to have peace. We discussed this at great length actually, maybe more than anything else. He wants to have a safe New York. Ultimately, a safe New York is going to be a great New York. If it's not safe, no matter how well we do with pricing and with uh anything else, we could talk about anything you want. If you don't have safe streets, it's not going to be a success. So, we're going to work together. We're going to make sure that if there horrible people there, we want to get them out. I think he wants to get them out maybe more than I do. So, we'll work together. We discussed it at great length. Yes, please.</p>
</details>

>> 你们俩都来自政治光谱的不同部分。但你们都是民粹主义者，我只是想知道总统的竞选风格、他的技巧、他对社交媒体的使用在多大程度上启发了你的竞选活动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Two questions if I may. One for you, uh, Mr. present on BBC in a second. But but first of all for the mayor elect um you're both um from different parts of the political spectrum. You're both populists though and I just wonder to what extent um the president's campaign style uh his techniques, his social media use inspired any part of your campaign?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我其实告诉总统，我们竞选活动的重点一直是生活成本危机。当我们询问那些投票给总统的纽约人，当我们看到他在纽约市的支持率上升时，问题都回到了同一个点：生活成本，生活成本，还是生活成本。他们谈论食品杂货的成本、租金的成本、联合爱迪生公司（Con Edison）的费用、托儿的成本。政客们常常试图教导纽约人应该关心什么，而不是倾听。当我们与那些投票给特朗普总统的选民交谈时，我们听到他们谈论生活成本。我们也关注同样的生活成本问题。这就是我非常期待与总统合作，在可负担性议程上为纽约人带来成果的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I actually told the president that you know so much of the focus of our campaign has been on the cost of living crisis. And when we asked those New Yorkers who had voted for the president when we saw an increase in his numbers in New York City that came back to the same issue, cost of living, cost of living, cost of living. And they spoke about the cost of groceries, the cost of rent, the cost of coned, the cost of child care. And too often politicians are looking to lecture to New Yorkers what they should care about as opposed to listen. And when we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak about cost of living. We focus on that same cost of living. And that's where I am really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the president on the affordability agenda.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为我们还需要做些工作。我们谈到了联合爱迪生公司。我们需要在降低价格方面下点功夫，因为我们已经把燃料价格降下来了，但这并没有体现在联合爱迪生公司的账单上，我们得和他们谈谈。如果我们以比一年前低得多的价格给他们送燃料，这是事实，那么我们就必须让联合爱迪生公司开始降低费率。绝对的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and I think we have to work a little bit. We talked about Con Edison. We have to work a little bit on getting the prices because, you know, we've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison and we're going to have to talk to them. You know, if if we're saying sending them fuel at a much lower price than it was a year ago, which is true, uh we have to get Con Edison to start lowering the rates. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

>> 如果可以的话，上周您告诉我，您正在推进起诉BBC，索赔高达50亿美元的计划。您还将与斯塔默首相交谈。这些问题有任何进展或更新吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And if I may, um, last week you told me, um, you were pushing ahead with your plans to sue the BBC for up to5 billion dollars. You're going to speak to Prime Minister Starmer as well. Is there any progress or any updates on those issues?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我们和首相相处得很好。我们和英国达成了一项协议。我喜欢他，他是个好人。而且，你知道，我认为他们有一些大的能源问题。他们到处都是风车。他们将不得不开始使用其他方法，因为他们的能源已经失控了。在英国，能源问题已经失控，他面临这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, we get along very well with the prime minister. We made a deal with UK. I like him. He's a fine person. And, you know, I think they have some big energy problems. You know, they've got windmills all over the place. are going to have to start using other methods because their energy is out of control. Talking about in the UK, it's out of control and he's got that problem.</p>

### 一则传闻引发的市场大逆转

好的，以上就是特朗普和姆达尼的会面。感谢大家的到来。我们今天提早开始就是为了看看这次会面是什么样的。这是一次相当友好的会面。我的意思是，这并不是一次带有任何一方攻击性潜台词的会议。会议上的一些引述是：“我们必须在生活成本问题上合作。存在可负担性危机。”特朗普说：“我认为我们会一起做得很好。”我的意思是，这实际上非常友好。很高兴在白宫看到姆达尼和特朗普这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so that is Trump and Mdani. Thank you everybody for being here. We did start early to see kind of what this meeting looked like. Uh rather amicable meeting. I mean it's not really a meeting with sort of an aggressive undertone from either of them. I mean, some of these quotes from the meeting is, "We got to work together on the cost of living. There's an affordability crisis." Trump says, "I think we're going to do a good job together." I mean, it actually was very friendly. So, nice to see that from Mumani and Trump in the White House. What is going on with the markets?</p>
</details>

市场转绿了，标普500指数上涨了1.21%。就价格走势而言，今天绝对是疯狂的一天。PayPal是绿的。MicroStrategy之前跌得更多，今天仍然是红的，但跌幅收窄了。标普指数整体上涨了1.2%。Rocket Lab在40.56。由于以太坊和加密货币仍在下跌，BMR仍然是红的。Palantir从147涨到156。Nebius一度几乎跌破80，现在回到84以上。SoFi曾跌至23.80，现在是25.31。那么发生了什么？是什么导致了这次逆转？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're green. 1.21% on the S&P 500. It has been an absolutely wild day uh in terms of how some of this price action has played out. PayPal's green. Micro Strategy was more red. It's still red on the day, but not as red. S&P a full 1.2% move to the upside. Rocket Lab at 40.56. BMR still red given Ethereum and crypto still down. Palinger from 147 to 156. Nebius was almost below 80 at one point. Now back above 84. SoFi was at 2380 now 2531. So what happened? What caused that reversal?</p>
</details>

嗯，我们看到了一条新闻头条，坦率地说，我没想到会有这条新闻。老实说，我甚至不知道这条新闻是否重要，但它确实让市场兴奋了起来。特朗普团队正在内部考虑向中国出售英伟达的**H200**（Nvidia H200: 英伟达针对出口管制推出的AI芯片）芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we had a headline and quite frankly, I didn't expect this headline. And I don't even know if this headline even matters to be honest, but it is a headline that got the markets excited. The Trump team is internally floating the idea of selling the H200 Nvidia chips to China.</p>
</details>

这条消息在东部时间下午1点52分出来时，扭转了市场的很多局面。我的意思是，消息一出来，我当天的投资组合就转绿了。很多不同的股票都上涨了。当然，不是所有股票都涨了，加密货币仍在受挫，但这绝对是一个转折点。英伟达当天一度跌至172美元。那是在上午11点左右。然后它开始回升，之后又跌回179。现在英伟达当天仍然是下跌的，报179.6，但在消息出来后，我们确实一度涨到了184。标普500指数在660点，上涨1.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That at 1:52 p.m. Eastern when it came out um kind of flipped a lot of the market. I mean, I ended up going green for the day as soon as that happened. You had a lot of different names pumped. Not everything pumped, obviously. crypto still taking a hit, but that definitely was the pivot. Nvidia got all the way down to 176 on the day. 176 172, sorry. Yeah, 172. That was at around 11 a.m. Then it kind of started moving back up. Then it fell back down to 179. And now you still are red on the day on Nvidia. 1796, but we did get up to 184 as soon as the headline came out. S&P 500 right there at 660, up 1.2.</p>
</details>

### 市场为何如此脆弱？

现在，我们如何分析这条新闻？首先，我认为这条新闻对英伟达来说无关紧要。你不能告诉我，在英伟达给出那样的业绩指引和财报之后，市场会因为英伟达能向中国销售而更高兴。我的意思是，市场应该为没有中国业务的财报和指引感到高兴。如果你每年从中国再增加200亿美元，那当然是好事，但这不应该足以扭转我们过去几天看到的所有痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, how do we analyze the headline? Number one, I think the headline is irrelevant for Nvidia. You can't tell me the market is more happy about Nvidia being able to sell to China uh after the guidance and the earnings that they gave. I mean, the market should be happy with the earnings and the guidance without China. If you add another $20 billion a year from China, like that's good, but that shouldn't be enough to u like reverse all the pain that we've seen over the past couple days.</p>
</details>

这当然足以引发盘中逆转，因为有很多交易员会看好这条新闻。但市场的反应方式非常奇怪，就好像我们被超卖到了市场需要某种新闻来提振的程度，而这条新闻恰好是关于地球上最重要的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That should definitely be enough for an intraday reversal obviously because you have a lot of traders that are going to be bullish on that headline. But it's just very weird how the market reacted to it and it's almost like we were getting so oversold to the point that the market needed some type of headline and that headline ended up being on the most important company on the planet.</p>
</details>

那么，为什么彭博社可能会从一位白宫官员那里泄露出这个消息，以便让新闻公之于众呢？嗯，我一直在想，你们大家也一直在想，特朗普可能会放出什么新闻来稳定四月份的市场。当时很简单，就是逆转关税。这次情况更复杂，因为涉及到降息和通货膨胀。所以，还有什么比提振世界上最重要的公司更好的新闻呢？因此，看起来白宫似乎有选择性地说：“嘿，我们要在英伟达上发布一些非常好的消息，看看是否能稳定局势。”结果标普指数上涨了1%。所以，这确实在一定程度上起到了稳定作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now why would this get leaked from Bloomberg potentially from a White House official to Bloomberg in order for the news to come out? Well, uh I've been wondering I think all of you guys have been wondering what headline Trump might come out with to stabilize the markets in April. It was as simple as reversing the tariffs. This time you've got a more complicated situation given rate cuts and inflation. So, what better headline than to pump the world's most important company? And so, it seems like the White House kind of selectively said, "Hey, we're going to get some really good news on Nvidia. See if that can stabilize things." And the S&P is up 1%. So, it definitely did stabilize to an extent,</p>
</details>

但这确实是一个非常奇怪的举动，因为这并不是市场应该为英伟达感到兴奋的理由。我们从英伟达得到的财报才是市场应该兴奋的理由，这就是为什么你看到涨势有点消退的原因。而且，很难想象进入下周，这就是我们需要的转折点，我们已经正式触底了。我真心希望我们已经触底了。感觉我们在很多关键技术位上确实被卖出去了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it is a very weird move because it's like this is not a reason that the market should be excited about Nvidia. The earnings that we got from Nvidia should be a reason the market's excited, which is why you're seeing the move kind of fade off a little bit. And it's just very confusing to imagine that going into next week, this is the pivot that we need and we have officially bottomed. And I really hope we have. It feels like we definitely got technically sold off on a lot of key levels,</p>
</details>

但下周我们将有更多关于就业、通胀以及**美联储**（The Federal Reserve: 美国联邦储备系统，即美国的中央银行）如何看待这些问题的数据。今天早上我们确实听到了很多美联储官员的讲话。一些联储主席持**鹰派**（Hawkish: 主张收紧货币政策以控制通胀）立场，一些则持**鸽派**（Dovish: 主张宽松货币政策以刺激经济）立场。其中最重要的联储主席之一，纽约联储主席威廉姆斯，他是鲍威尔最重要的代理人之一，表现得相当鸽派，并表示：“我们可能需要降息。”这在早上推动了市场上涨。但后来我们回落了，然后这条英伟达的新闻出来了，我们又上涨了，现在又有点消退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but next week we're going to have a lot more data in regards to jobs, inflation, how the Fed is thinking of this. We did have a lot of Fed speak this morning. Some of the Fed presidents were bearish. Some of the Fed presidents were bullish, or I should say hawkish versus doubbish. One of the most important Fed presidents, the New York Fed President Williams, who is one of the biggest proxies in the context of JPAL, was pretty damn doubbish and said, "We probably need a cut." That in the morning got the market moving green. But then we faded and then this Nvidia headline came out and then we pumped and now it's kind of fading.</p>
</details>

所以，我仍然认为市场对正在发生的事情感到恐惧。但这也向你表明，为什么恐慌性抛售可能不是答案。一条新闻，特朗普的一条简单推文，一个关于英伟达的简单想法，就能让市场掉头向上。我的意思是，标普指数曾下跌约1.2%，现在上涨了1.2%。完全是受那条英伟达新闻的影响而逆转。如果市场如此脆弱，显然，下行波动可能会很艰难，但这也意味着它可以非常迅速地逆转，这就是为什么逃跑可能不是最好的主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, I still think there's just fear around the idea of what's going on. But it it goes to show you as well why panic selling is just likely not the answer here. Um, one headline, one simple tweet by Trump, one simple idea about Nvidia can turn the market up. I mean, the S&P was down about 1.2%, now it's up 1.2%. Complete reversal off that Nvidia headline. And if if the market is that fragile, obviously, the downside volatility can be tough, but that also means it can reverse very quickly, which is why running for the hills might not be the best idea.</p>
</details>

降息概率为69.5%，今天早上是75%，昨天则低至30%。所以，我们至少回升到70%的水平，这也不是最坏的情况。Sherpa说至少没有昨天那么糟糕。是的，至少我们在进入周末时有了一些稳定，这很重要。我的意思是，如果我们在进入周末时崩盘，那将是糟糕的。所以，看起来我们标普指数会收绿，英伟达可能会收红，但至少我们没有在英伟达跌破170美元的边缘徘徊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">69.5% chance on the rate cut probability that was 75% today morning. was, you know, down um down at 30% yesterday. So, the fact that we at least got the move back up into the 70s is not the worst thing. Sherpa says at least it's not as bad as yesterday. Yeah, at least we got a little bit of stability going into going into the weekend, which is what matters. I mean, if we were uh if we were going to crash going into the weekend, it would have sucked. And so, I mean, it looks like we're going to end out green on the S&P, maybe end out red on Nvidia, but at least we're not $2 away from going below 170 on Nvidia.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是今天发生的主要新闻。真正改变一切的是这条英伟达的新闻，那时你看到市场变得更加兴奋。我们确实从彭博社这里得到了一些来自**BLS**（Bureau of Labor Statistics: 美国劳工统计局）的更多数据。首先，BLS表示我们不会得到十月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标），这也不是什么好消息。我们确实得到了一些**PMI**（Purchasing Managers' Index: 采购经理人指数，反映制造业健康状况的指标）和一些消费者信心数据，所有这些都相对不错。一些指标略好于预期，另一些则略低于预期。市场对此不太在意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that was kind of the main headline that happened uh throughout the day. It was really this Nvidia headline that changed everything and that's when you got the market to get a bit more excited. We did get a little bit more BLS data right here from Bloomberg. So, this BLS data, well, first of all, the BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics, that we're not going to get October CPI, that also wasn't the best in the world. We did get some PMI, some consumer confidence data, all of that was relatively good. slight beats in some of the metrics, slight misses on some of the others. Market didn't care too much about this.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济数据不容乐观

这是我们昨天或今天早上得到的一份数据，我觉得非常有趣。拥有四年制大学学位的美国人现在占全国所有失业人口的创纪录的25%，也就是说，白领工作岗位在很长一段时间内首次出现放缓。拥有学士学位的人的失业率较高，为2.8%，同比上升0.5个百分点，约190万人。20至24岁年轻人的失业率为9.2%，比去年上升了2%。2025年的就业增长几乎完全集中在医疗保健、社会援助、休闲和酒店业，其他领域的就业持平或略有下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's a piece of data we got yesterday or this morning that I thought was really interesting. Americans with four-year degrees now make up a record 25% of all unemployed people in the country, aka white collar jobs are slowing down for the first time in a long time. The jobless rate for a bachelor's degree is higher at 2.8% up.5 percentage point year about 1.9 million people.

我的意思是，当你看到像这样一份汇总数据时，很难想象十月份的就业报告会很好看。即使是积极的，也不会在所有其他行业都是积极的。它可能只在某些行业是积极的，这又会引发关于失业和劳动力市场的问题。所以，劳动力市场是个问题，这是无法否认的。我们明白劳动力市场是个问题。我们唯一能希望的是，即使美联储没有得到数据，他们也能认识到这一点，但无论如何，你都会想象，希望这能导致降息。

<p class="english-text">I mean that October jobs report when you look at a sort of aggregate piece of data like this, it's hard to imagine that October jobs report is going to be pretty. And even if it's positive, it's not going to be positive in all the other sectors. It might be only positive in certain sectors, which again is going to beg the question around unemployment and the labor market. So, the labor market's an issue. There's no way to deny it. We understand the labor market's a problem. The only thing that we can hope for is the Fed recognizes that even if they don't get the data, but regardless, you would imagine that hopefully that leads to a rate cut.</p>

关于那条新闻，我忘了提另一件事。我不认为中国想要H200芯片。他们想要的是**Blackwell**（英伟达的下一代GPU架构）。我的意思是，他们已经很清楚地表示，他们不想要那些阉割版的芯片和老一代的芯片。所以，英伟达因为那条新闻而上涨，这真的很奇怪。我只是觉得它被超卖了，需要一些动力来启动，但Blackwell才是中国真正想要的。而且你知道，如果他们甚至不想要H200，那对英伟达在中国的盈利增长来说，可能不是最令人兴奋的事情。

<p class="english-text">Here's another thing I forgot to mention about that headline. I don't think China wants the H200s. They want Blackwell. I mean, they've been pretty clear that they don't want the beat up chips and the old generation chips. So, again, the fact that Nvidia moved on that headline, it was just very weird. I just think it was oversold and it needed some type of juice to get moving, but uh Blackwell is really what China wants. And you know, if they don't even want the H200s, that might not be the most exciting thing for Nvidia's earnings growth into China.</p>

### 技术分析：市场处于关键决策点

Amit: 让我们把标普指数调出来。我们先谈谈标普指数，然后进入快速点评环节。我们会给每个股票两分半钟的时间。所以，我们会尽量多讲一些股票。但我认为，总的来说，你对指数当前情况的分析会很有价值。

<p class="english-text">Amit: well, let's pull up the the S&P. We're going to get guys, we're going to do S&P and then we're going to get into rapid fire. We'll do two minutes 30 per tick. So, we'll try to do as many tickers as possible. But I mean in general I do think the analysis on what you think is happening with the index would be valuable here.</p>

Jason: 目前幕后有很多事情正在发生。我今天早些时候在CNBC上听一位技术分析师讲话，我心想，哇，好吧，希望我不会把事情搞得太复杂。

<p class="english-text">Jason: There are a lot of things going on under the under the covers right now. And so um I was listening to an a technician on like CNBC earlier today and I was like wow okay I hope hopefully I don't overly complicate things.</p>
</details>

Jason: 目前的设置预示着一场剧烈的波动，无论是向上还是向下。从技术上讲，有迹象表明我们正在走弱。日本的日元问题带来了一些不确定性，这可能给市场增加了一些恐惧。加上我们很长时间没有收到的大量数据涌入，市场就是讨厌不确定性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: So the what's what's true is that the setup is um the setup is for a violent move right now one way or the other and and technically speaking we got to start the timer. Oh you want to do this timer on this one? Yeah just five minutes five minutes on this one. Y all right fair enough. So technically speaking, um there are signs of of of us fading here and there are there are have you talked about the yen stuff, Japan? And so that that is a bit of an overhang and it's probably adding a little bit of fear to the markets and with the the influx of data coming in that we haven't had for a really long time, the market just just hates uncertainty, right?</p>
</details>

Jason: 尽管我们有英伟达的财报，但同时我们接连收到了非农就业数据，如果你还没搞清楚，这才是对市场最重要的事情。这根K线应该告诉你，尽管英伟达极其重要，非农就业数据仍然更重要。所以，虽然英伟达把我们推向了高点，但非农就业数据几乎把我们拉向了低点。

<p class="english-text">Jason: And while we got Nvidia this day, we also at the same time backtoback got non-farm payrolls, which if you haven't figured out is the biggest the biggest thing for the market. And what this candle should tell you is that even though Nvidia is extremely重要, non-farm payrolls is still more important. And so, while Nvidia took us to the upside, non-farm payrolls pretty much took us to the downside.</p>
</details>

Jason: 最终，这一切基本上都相互抵消了。但现在我们所处的位置是，我们正略微向下倾斜。这里有一个斜率。所以，除非我们能突破今天的高点，否则趋势向下。如果我们确实突破了今天的高点，我会告诉你我们将去到这个水平。就像我们讨论过的Nebius图表一样，这将简单到只有两条线：昨天的高点和低点，675和651，而中线就是今天的高点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: [clears throat] And and all that said, at the end of the day, it kind of washed out basically even closing right about here. But this is where we are now. We're going to actually get a slew of non-farm payrolls moving forward faster than normal. And so it's all it's all currently in flux. We are trending slightly down. We do have a bit of a slope here. So unless we can get over basically today's high now and if we do get over today's high where I'll tell you that we will go is to this level right here and and just like we talked about that Nebas chart it's going to be it's going to be as simple as two lines in the sand and it's yesterday's high and low 675 and 651 and and the center line is today's high right and so</p>
</details>

Jason: 如果我们能突破663.72，我们很可能会接近高点。而此时此刻，就是你决定是否需要采取措施保护投资组合的时候了。我不是说卖掉任何东西，我的意思是像**零成本期权组合策略**（Costless Collars: 一种通过卖出看涨期权所得权利金来购买看跌期权，从而在不花费成本的情况下对冲下行风险的策略）之类的。这是你的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: today's high happens to actually be 50% of yesterday's range, which when you look at this is pretty simple. So today's high was like right in the middle, smack dab of the middle of yesterday's range, which is very much [snorts] uh to be expected for a basic kind of push back. And if you can get over 66372, look, we're very likely going to get close to the highs. And this is this right here, this moment in time, this is going to be your point at which you decide, do I want to take measures here now? Protect my portfolio. I don't mean sell anything. What I do mean is like callers, things like that. Selling selling covered calls. That's your opportunity.</p>
</details>

Jason: 然而，如果趋势走低，低于今天的低点，那么我所说的剧烈波动就会发生。我看到高盛的数据，标普500中位数股票的空头利息仍然接近近年来的最高水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Um, right here. And and it's going to be very much sentiment driven. So, does the market give you that opportunity? That's what it is. If we're trending lower though below essentially today's low [clears throat] then that violent move that I'm talking about actually in both scenarios and I'll show you then this this whole thing trending down is is is possible um and this is probably not going to be US related this is probably what they're they're yapping about in terms of like the end thing right the Japanese thing it's not going to be all in once this is like a multi-mon thing u but right now. This right here, 650, that's the lows. And so when you're deep red like that, that you don't want to sell that. Honestly, you'd probably buy that cuz we're going to bounce. Um, and that's exactly what we did. And we're not going lower right now. So, for now, the bottom is in. And I don't think that we're going lower right now. We're just not going lower. Today, all the internal gauges actually said that buyers started stepping in and it actually looked pretty constructive overall. So, I think that the local lows are in right now and that we're in for a pretty what's going to feel like a aggressive bounce and it's going to get a bit it it might get a bit euphoric, but I don't want to get over my skis because we're actually not out of the weeds yet. The only way that we get out of the weeds, like out of out of like that we're no longer in trouble, is if we do get over that 675 level. And and if that happens, what we what we need to understand right now is that there are a lot of people that are currently hedged. And there are a lot of people that are currently short for like a big downside move, which I'm no doomsdayer. But by the way, to your point, I just saw something from Goldman Sachs. this that is short interest for the median S&P 500 stock remains closest to the highest level in recent years.</p>
</details>

Jason: 对。这就是为什么我说我们正准备迎接一场剧烈的波动。我的意思是短时间内的剧烈波动。所以这将是一个快速的变动。如果你想卖出再买回，首先，速度会非常快。而且一切都会同时触底。所以你无法挑选你想买什么。一切都会同时发生，所有的一切。这会非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Right? And so here's why I'm saying we're we're primed for a violent move. And I mean violent in in a short order violence. So it's not going to be is not I think it's going to be a quick move. And so if you're trying to sell and then reby, first of all, it's going to be really fast. And I don't know that and and and everything is going to bottom all at once. And so like you're not going to be able to pick and choose what you want to buy. It's all going to happen at once, all of it. And it's going to be really hard.</p>
</details>

Jason: 如果我们突破了昨天的高点，所有这些空头都将不得不回补。他们将开始回补空头，这意味着他们将在这里做多，而且我们走得越高，上行的势头就越猛烈，一场上行挤压将会发生，因为他们现在做空仓位太重了。如果发生这种情况，那么700点就会重新回到视野中，就像那样。所有这些下行的鬼把戏都结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: So, uh, so like I said, callers are your friend in this situation. Uh, costless callers ideally. Uh, I'm out of time here, but my point is if we're over yesterday's high, all of these shorts are going to have to co cover and they're and they're going to start covering their shorts, meaning they're going to get long really over here and it's going to get more and more violent to the upside the higher that we go and a squeeze to the upside will ensue because we they are so so covered and exposed to the short side now because they want they kind of want it to go down and if it doesn't it's going going to be an upside squeeze and and if that's the case then boom boom 700s are back in play just like just like that and what and all this downside shenanigans is over now</p>

### 个股快速点评

Amit: 好的，我们计时2分30秒。我们会尽量多讲一些股票。让我们从BMR开始，因为他们今天有财报，很好奇你怎么看它的价格。我知道它和以太坊相关，但总的来说，你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. So we'll do 2:30 on the clock. We'll try to get through as many tickers as possible. Let's start with BMR because they had earnings today and just curious on kind of how you're thinking of the the price. I know it's correlated to ETH, but in general, how are you thinking of it here?</p>
</details>

Jason: 我今天可能买了这只股票。我可能买早了。不，我不认为我买早了。BMR的图表左侧没什么可看的，因为低于这个水平的东西不多。你基本上处于无人区。我们现在低于200天简单移动平均线。但就像一只股票处于历史高位时一样，我实际上可以用简单的扩展（如斐波那契扩展）来预测一只股票处于历史低位时的情况。如果周一价格超过26美元，那么对我来说，这个跳空低开就意味着它本应继续下跌但没有，这通常预示着它会向上填补缺口。所以，如果它跌破25.25美元，我就知道它会继续下跌，可能会到22美元甚至20美元。但今天它跳空低开后，买盘介入，收盘价高于昨天的低点。这被称为失败的延续。这意味着它本该下跌，但人们开始逢低买入。考虑到整个市场都在低点被买入，这是一个值得一试的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: I might have bought the stock today. Wow. I might be early. No, I don't think I'm really, but I Okay. So, so here was the last breakdown because so BMR is uh the the comments are earnings. Yeah, I know. It's true. Hilarious. Um is so you can't you can't really look left because there's not Did I not press play? Damn it. Sorry. Here's our timer. You can't really look left on this because there's not a lot below this. You're just kind of in no man's land, which [clears throat] we are below this. Somehow this has a 200E simple moving average now. But that's we're we're below the 200 day simple moving average. But just like when a stock is in all-time high territory, I can I can actually forecast when a stock is in all-time low territory with with simple extensions. like fib extensions. And essentially what I was looking at um was it this one? It might not have been that one. Yeah, it was this. Was it this guy? I don't remember which one it was. Oh, it I'm sorry. It was this breakdown here. So here to here reversal goodness. I got to I got to pick the right one here. Okay, so here was the breakdown from the week and here was the consolidation. This is the one I was looking at. All right. Literally right here. So, this is the post postweekly breakdown. The last one. Um, I got to pull up what I literally sent it in our group. So, maybe I should pull it up over here. Not Palunteering. Anyways, yeah, I think this is very close to it. Mine was What did I do? I did it from this prior oh yeah prior weekly range I had like it's possible that it continues down but it had basically hit my downside target um and to like 2650 basically roundabout for what is that your target 2650 or below 26 upside no your downside like like when did you buy I guess my question literally uh so I'll get into it right now so see this gap right here this is very small time frame Oh, shoot. I'm running out of time. So, there's a session gap here. And so, it's just a small kind of reversal day. If we're if we're over 26 26 bucks Monday, then this gap down for me, I have a rule set, like a trading rule set where like if I have a gap to the downside, what normally happens is that the stock should continue to the downside if it's going to actually continue on in that direction. And if it doesn't, what what that means is, okay, well, [clears throat] um, then I should I should actually expect that it's going to traverse up towards the gap. And so, there's a level here that if this is trading over 25 in change, 25 and a half, well, then I know it's at least going to hug in towards the gap. And so, for me right now, if it's going below 25 and a quarter, then I know, okay, it's going back down. and it's probably going back down to 22 and then I might even see 20. But that's my kind of like relative stop loss right now on BMR. So for this ad, if it's if it's below 25 and a quarter, look, I I'm very likely actually going to see 20. Um, so I can have a pretty tight stop loss in this instance. But this this line here, that was yesterday's low. And today it was actually closing the gap, starting to reverse it, and it actually closed above yesterday's low. So today I'm looking at BMR. Look, it gapped down. They bought the gap and it's actually closing above yesterday's low. This is what we call a failed continuation. Meaning it it it was supposed to be going down, but people started stepping in and buying this dip. I'm looking at the market across the board. Okay, cool. The whole market is getting bought up on the lows. This is actually a relative low. It's worth a shot. It's all it is. It's it's a it's a basic shot. Um, and if it doesn't work out, it's going to be a quick and quick and dirty. Okay, throw it throw it in the trash. But this is this is trading. It's a very tight risk to but with a very high high reward type entry on BMR here. So that's for me this is more of a trading entry. Um, I think all all downside targets for sure all downside targets here have been hit also. So it's the time for shorts to cover. So, you bought it around 26 basically. That's what you're saying. I bought it. Yeah, literally 26 in change. I bought it higher. That's what I was saying. I mean, that's where it was hovering for the majority of the day. It broke down a little bit under that, but made sense that that's where you felt like picking up some more. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, I posted it, but about 26, right when it was reclaiming yesterday's low.</p>

Jason: 我知道，我多买了一些。我确实买了Palantir。我几乎想买一个短期的看涨期权，因为我觉得这个位置很好。它基本上已经走完了整个下跌过程。离200日均线非常近了。我认为这只股票下周会迎来一次相当大的反弹。但前提是我之前说的所有关于市场其他部分的话都成立。一次大的反弹。这是底部吗？我不知道。我们得看看之后会发生什么。但你不应该在这里卖出。

Who knows, right? But this is</p>

Amit: 我认为要发生这种情况，英伟达必须崩溃。我认为它们是捆绑在一起的。我不认为Palantir会轻易跌到100而英伟达保持稳定。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: I think for that for that to happen I think Nvidia's got to get collapse. Like I think they're tied together. I don't think pounder easily goes to 100 and Nvidia stays</p>
</details>

Jason: 逻辑很简单。上周二我们说有两个区域。我们谈到了173这个区域，我说180左右可能还行，但那不是买入区。真正的支撑在150这个区域。我实际上在160多的时候买了一点。但总的来说，这个区域，我们可以从图表上很清楚地看到。我喜欢这个区域。它能跌得更低吗？是的，Palantir就是那种涨跌都很快的股票。我们可以看到138，这是有可能的。但如果它能突破158，也许是160这个小上影线，下周我们就会很快回到上周二我谈到的173这个水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: like again they they are the AI trade together. That's why they're talked about together. So I I think it's a good buy today if we think Nvidia stabilizes as well. Well, so the logic was pretty simple, right? Last Tuesday we said, "Hey, look, there were two zones. Last Tuesday we talked about this or two two or three Tuesdays ago we talked about this 173 uh zone right which I said like 180s is probably fine I said this not a buy zone that that it's you want to see this hold but this is not a buy zone right and that the real support was in this 150 area I actually nibbled at 160s um and I made a post and I was like my token my token my token contribution to the paler support club So, it was a bigger buy. Um, but I is it like the buy again? Any if I'm buying anything right now, it's it's it's with more ammo later to come. But, um, but this general area right here, we can see it pretty clearly on the charts. I I like this area. Can it like go down? Look, Palanteer is one of those like it gets it gets wicked up so fast. So, if I want to be, let's do this. Let's call out 142. And it's just this general node. So, I can see 138s. I can see that on the charts. It's possible, right? But this if it gets over and really what I'm what I'm talking about is if it gets over 158 and maybe this little wick of 160 next week, we're going to revisit this 173 level that I talked about last Tuesday in extreme short order. And so and and at that point, I know that there's going to be a very quick trend like next week. And that would be that would be a pretty violent bounce. That's a that's a near 10% bounce for next week and it could probably extend into those SMAs at which point hey look I have a I have a decision to make and when things get a little overheated well it's possible that I actually see 190 from here. So that's that's the logic. But at that point, all right, of these buys probably I need to take a little profit on. I will say that because you have you have if you're trading uh you you'd have a 25% quick profit on something like that just on equity, not even options. All right. I like it. Can it go lower? Yes. But this is primed actually for a pretty big bounce. just a mean reversion kind of to to get back to these SMAs. Uh, and if it does, then cool. We're flattening out, but still not out of the weeds.</p>

Amit: 让我们接着谈谈英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay. Let's do Nvidia right after that.</p>
</details>

Jason: 上周二，我99%肯定我在英伟达的图表上画了一条线，它看起来就像这样，并且正好停在这里。当这种情况发生时，我当时正在我的小组里直播，我说：“好吧，庆祝一下，这很酷。”但问题是，那是盘后交易，盘后交易的情况待定。一切都取决于第二天的盘前交易。它需要走得更高才能真正巩固上涨趋势。但当市场开盘，你看到这个，你几乎立刻就知道没有延续性，这就是我们所说的看跌回撤。但总的来说，我们其实哪儿也没去，我们还在原地。这并不糟糕，但即使在今天的新闻之后，我认为这有点说明问题，但我们守住了低点。177美元过去是，现在仍然是英伟达的关键水平。坦率地说，这张图表上什么都没变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Have you seen uh a 3 and a half% reversal like what we saw on Thursday? I mean I think Goldman said the last time it happened was like 10 years ago at the magnitude that it happened. I mean it was pretty incredible to see on the NASDAQ. Well, yeah. On the entire market, but Nvidia kind of led it going up 500 billion then down 500 billion in two hours. Was it three and a half? I honestly I didn't even notice. Like I've seen reversals like this on a regular basis. Uh it didn't feel like that crazy to me. Um I was I was literally expecting something like this. Um like if I go back if you go back and if you go back to last Tuesday or no I'm sorry last this Tuesday and you click on the Nvidia time stamp. Can we do that? Is that possible? Not right now because we got a lot of tickers. But you can do that if do that and go back. Click on the Nvidia time stamp. And I'm like 99% positive I drew a line on Nvidia and it looks like this when I drew that line. I'm like I'm 99% positive that that was my line and it stopped exactly right here. I I'm actually I'm 100% positive because that is the zone. Um and and and when that happened in this moment, like I was live in in my group and I was like, "Okay, celebrate. It's cool." Um but the the thing is that that we don't know cuz that's after hours and after hours is is TBD. It's all about premarket in the following day. um it needed to go higher for me like to really solidify an upside. It's very possible that that next morning it actually did open. So it we didn't really know in the moment um because it could have continued on but when the market opened and you see this you you know pretty much immediately there's no extension and and that is what we call like the bearish retracement right here. But yeah, go back to the time stamp and and so here we're actually all that said, we haven't gone anywhere and and we're we're exactly where we are. Um this is not horrible, but even after the news kind of today, I think it's a bit of a tell, but we're holding the lows. So here's yesterday's low. I don't know that you need to use Nvidia as the example because it just had earnings. So I don't I don't actually think that Nvidia is going to tell what's going on in the market. 77 is was and actually remains pretty much the level on Nvidia. Um and that's exactly the point of control of this entire consolidation here and it remains the the the area of interest uh for this general consolidation. So I actually don't think anything has changed for Nvidia. Um the chart based on what just happened actually not that I don't think like nothing has actually changed on this chart quite frankly. It's it's exact same what it was like the other day.</p>

You're gone, right? So just like everything else, you basically just traverse to the next one, which is down here. You're probably going to wick into this. You could extend. The real one is actually in here, right? But let's say you bounce here. The thing with this, which is what's happening, is that you're going to get back up in here. What What do you think is going to happen when when you do get up here? That's really the tell. So, again, we're going to have moments of that that that wild euphoria. Just does it hold? We don't know, right? So, it's going to it's going to happen at some point, right? The question is, are you going to be caught up in the I'm I'm super ecstatic like we're going to the moon again or or what are we doing? Right? And I think that's that's that's trading. Is it investing? It's not investing. It's trading. Um and even if we get higher, this is why trading is very much if this then that, right? Or you know, it's one level to the next because it's it's also possible to get back here. And even if you get all the way back here, then well then you have to deal with the same the same question yet again. What are those people going to do? Right? And then and then you're same question yet again. What are those people going to do? [clears throat] And that's that's how this works. But this right here, those are your levels. If you lose them, then you go to the next one lower. But right here,</p>

Amit: 你会在这里买入比特币吗？

<p class="english-text">Amit: are you are you are you like at all interested in buying here like Bitcoin? Yeah. Like a DC simple DCA here or you think below 80 is more? [clears throat]</p>
</details>

Jason: 不会。我对购买更多比特币没有兴趣。如果有人想逢低买入，我会告诉他们等到70多美元。说真的，如果你想买，70多美元才是目标。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: No. Well, no. Not Bitcoin. Bitcoin. Yeah. No. No. So, you would not buy here? No. You think it's a falling knife here? I just don't have any interest in in buying more Bitcoin. No, but in general, if you had to objectively, if someone wanted to buy the dip, would you think this is a price that's attractive? Also, no. Okay. Because 84 is down a lot from 126, right? If someone was thinking, hey, maybe it's time to finally buy. No, I'd tell them to wait to the 70s. I for sure. like like legit you want you want to do it. Um like okay 70s boom there it isoo. So [laughter] uh I would I I I legit would tell him to do that like</p>

Amit: 那么以太坊呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay. So before coin, let's do ETH as well. I assume you think ETH is in the same trend as BTC.</p>
</details>

Jason: 不，我其实更看好以太坊。因为它没有像比特币那样上涨，所以情况不同。以太坊实际上处于我的目标区域。以太坊现在的位置相当于比特币在70美元的水平。这就是区别。问题在于，当我说价格会从高点跌到2800左右时，每个人都觉得跌势缓慢而有条不紊，这通常不是底部的迹象。底部是快速而剧烈的，像清算事件。这感觉不像。但说实话，从这里往下的任何地方，长期来看可能都是一个非常好的位置。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: No. So I actually So ETH I like better. because because one, it hasn't made the move that um Bitcoin has and so it's it's different. It's a different it's a different situation. ETH is actually at my level general area. So ETH is at the equivalent level of Bitcoin at 70. Now that's the difference. So ETH is is essentially at the equivalent of Bitcoin at 70 right now. The issue I have right like with ETH is that everybody in their mother um when I said like 28 from the from the highs and then you know and I gave like very explicit numbering numbers dude everybody this the grind to those levels was slow and and and methodical that's that's not usually indicative of a bottom. A bottom is like fast and violent, right? Like a liquid liquidation event. It's not that's not a liquidation event. I know that that feels like a liquidation event. This is not a liquidation event. This is a liquidation event, [laughter] right? This right here, it doesn't have to happen. That's a liquidation event. Like this is a liquidation event. But the slow the slow and steady grind to the downside. [laughter] This is not a liquidation event. Although it feels like it feels bad. Like it feels like my my bank account is getting liquidated as an event. Um do do you think it was because of the Binance crypto glitch or No? Um, I think that I think that yesterday's continuation to the downside looked very much like an algorithmic like like continuation sell all day long in in the markets as a whole. Um, I don't know. I [clears throat] don't know if I would attribute that to this as a whole. I think that maybe the yen thing has to do with the crypto markets possibly. But all that said, 26 373 I don't that like I think that was my level. That's that golden that's literally right here. Um that's possibly it. It's possible that that's it, right? And if you like Ethereum, the truth is that anywhere from here down is probably a really good spot long term. Like it's probably a decent spot. Unlike like Bitco Bitcoin is probably a decent spot. A little bit lower, but this is probably a decent spot. Now, are there better spots? Yeah, there are. But that general area, this general area can come as as low can come as low as 21. So it's like this green box right here. And from here in the event of an actual liquidation event, that's 2159. So I did post that, right? Like if you really wanted a nasty entry, if if all of a sudden everybody got liquidated from buying at that at at my level, whatever it was, why do I have so many numbers here? What's going on? Anyways, from this 26 37 whatever 2637 like those liquidation events can come down to 259 and and and 2159 and that's in that general box overall is going to be probably a massive discount long term. But again, do do you need to be ultra specific? I don't think so. But if this if this fails, that's probably where it goes. But I don't know that it's going to fail. That's a guess. Total guess. So, uh, if you like it though, I I think this is your area.</p>

Amit: Robinhood (Hoodie) 呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Hoodie.</p>
</details>

Jason: 我大部分对Hoodie的买单实际上都设置在70多美元。但我一直在小口买入。现在我认为我们可以看到Hoodie反弹一下。上周二我说，我们在这里，我认为这是一个反弹点，至少会反弹到115美元，甚至可能再次到120美元的区域。但到那时情况就很难说了。如果它能突破115，很好，我能看到123。但如果它明确跌破100，那么75左右的水平就会出现。即使我到了130多，那个175的延伸目标也不在考虑范围内了。因为到那时我需要处理所有这些买家，任何上涨都会是混乱和震荡。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: Hoodie. [clears throat] Uh it's right into this it's right into this area. So hoodie so first of all hoodie as much as I would love to say that oh it's it's done going down I have I have no idea. Uh it is not is not made the lows yet. Uh well it has not made the track to the bit if you think Bitcoin is going to 70. Unfortunately I think Hood's down with it. Mo most of my buys on Hood are actually set to like 70s just to be straight up. Uh and I but I have been absolutely nibbling. Um and uh right now I think that we can bounce a bit on hood hoodie. Um last Tuesday I said hey look we're we're up here. This I think is a bounce spot. I think that we bounced at least to like 115 maybe even that 120 area again. Um but at that point is very much TVD. Uh so this 113ish area here 115 is how this works. That that's your kind of trajectory. This is actually about about the halfway point from here to here of yesterday's range 11516. See how that works? Right there. Um got bought up pretty quickly. I actually bought this because I I I think this is if if the market turns like and all of a sudden um first of all I don't have to be super bullish on crypto to me in my mind for me to be bullish in in hoodie. You guys can you know think what you want but um Bitcoin doesn't have earnings. Hoodie does. Hoodie has a lot of lines of business. Bitcoin only has Bitcoin. Um, that said though, this is very correlated, extremely correlated, and I think it can bounce, but I think it can get in trouble around 115 for sure. And it's going to be the same thing as everything else. If it can get over 115, cool. I can see 123. This bad boy is not out of the weeds yet. If it can get get over 123, then boom, I can see 130s again. Not out of the weeds yet, right? If it gets like definitively below 100, well that 75ish level is happening. Um and and that that is what it is. Even if I get to 130s, that 175 kind of extension is not in play, right? Cuz what what what I have to deal with at that point in time is I have to deal with all of these buyers. Any upside here is going to be slop and chop, right? I have to deal with all these buyers that are going to decide whether or not they're going to sell on me. I know what I'm going to do or I know what I'm not going to do, but I need to see does this happen and does that happen and if so then what? Right? And so if that then what right? So that that takes me to 135 which would be if this if this is the low then I have to really really be concerned at 135. If I can get over 135, cool. I'm talking about 150s, but that's all I'm talking about. I can't be talking about anything else other than that. And only if we're over 150s then then for sure. I'm talking about higher and I'm talking about 180s now. I'm not talking about 175s, but not not until those things happens. That's what slop and chop means from a technical perspective. Um, but that's what this looks like for now. What has happened is that I have come right into that. If if this was the mountain range and this is the city center, I've just hit a high traffic area and it's going to be really difficult in the near term for Hood to actually get below this $90 kind of level. So, I'm okay with thinking that buyers are going to step in as they have in the past on the greatest company on earth. I don't know about you guys, but that's just me and I'm super biased, so don't listen to me. But that's that's my two cents.</p>

Amit: 亚马逊呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, last two. Amazon.</p>
</details>

Jason: 我多买了一点亚马逊。这实际上是我今天的主要买入。今天的低点实际上是216的相对低点，我们这周早些时候也谈到过。我认为在所有七巨头中，我仍然最喜欢亚马逊现在的位置，最适合反弹。我认为这张图表在整个下跌过程中并没有受到太大损害。所以我最喜欢这一只，包括谷歌和苹果。我认为谷歌和苹果可能风险更大一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: I like So I bought Amazon a little bit more. [gasps] This is actually [clears throat] my my main buy today. So why' I have that? Oh, that's from prior. What the hell is that? That's from prior something. I guess I have that labeled wrong. That we'll just call it something else is a big deal. level. This goes like way across. So the lows today actually here were these relative lows 216 which we kind of talked about last or this Tuesday earlier this week. Um which is which is like we bought you bought the other day too, right? Yeah, you said that. So, I think you and I both bought the other day. And I'm not being super specific. I don't know if you're being super specific either. Like, I just know, hey, look, it's come down. I'm just going to just grab it somewhere. What? I don't even care. Right somewhere in this area. Um, and then if price gets in here, I'll probably buy it that day, too. Uh, and that'll probably be it for now, unless I see something like nasty. So, I think I'm I'm mostly done with this general area of nibbling. [clears throat] Um, and from here, like this is just look, I think this this move was steep. I think Amazon is of all of the Mag 7s, I still like where this spot is. Uh, I like this one the best for a bounce area here. I don't I I I don't actually think there was a lot of damage to this chart throughout this entire thing. So, of all of them, including Google and Apple, I actually like this one the best here based on a lot based on it's already made the the trajectory down. I think Google and Apple might actually be a little bit more at risk. They might be just the last generals to fall. This hasn't made that. And I have a pretty clean riskreward from even trading perspective. And I can probably get a little at least mean reversion here, which might even bring me back to the general areas, at least to the top of here, and then I'll have a better decision to make for now. So, I like this one a lot.</p>

Amit: 最后一个是特斯拉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, last one is Tessy.</p>
</details>

Jason: 特斯拉，我认为你只需要冷静。它回到了那个位置。我认为它需要更多时间。特斯拉的问题在于415美元的区域，我们谈论过这个，这个史上最重要的水平，仍然在扮演阻力角色。这就是我们现在看到的。所以特斯拉被卡住了。这意味着它现在实际上是无趋势的。它没有失守，但它紧贴着这条线。你不想看到它失守。这是特斯拉更广泛的上升趋势。如果它确实失守了，那么轨迹就是向下，一个更大的下跌波段，会到200日均线。但在此之前不会。所以，是这些局部低点在支撑。如果特斯拉失守这里，无论这是哪里，那么下跌就会发生。在那之前，这里是混乱的震荡，直到你能重新站上并超越。这就是特斯拉现在的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Tessy, I think you just chill. It is at the spot. It's re It's revisited the spot. I think it needs more time. The problem with Tesla is that that 415 zone, which is like we've talked about this um 415 zone again, the biggest deal level ever is still acting as resistance and that's what we're seeing right now. So Tesla is stuck. That's what's that's what that's what's going on with Tesla. It's completely stuck. Um, which means it's actually going to be trendless right now. It's not lost it, but it's hugging this line. You don't want to see it lose this. So, this is the broader uptrend on Tesla. And if it does lose this, well, well, then the trajectory is down like a larger leg down to the 200, but not not before then. So, it's these local lows like this that are holding. If Tesla loses this, wherever this is, then this is happening. Until then, um it's sloppy, choppy in here until you can get back up and above. And so, that is the story of Tesla right now. trend is intact, but it's not it's it's it's got to reclaim its footing right now. This is the broader trend. And I think if anything, you need to be really patient with Tesla. If you're buying here, it's just okay. It's not great, right? It's it's it's literally just okay. If you if you'd like a better buy, wait for this to break down. That will probably be a better buy. Uh or you wait for it to reclaim its uptrend and you buy it higher. That's just me. That's a trader mentality. It's not an investor mentality. That's what the session's about. Um, [clears throat] I think it's very sloppy, choppy. Yeah, I think a it's because it's got a it's got a it's got a lot of work to do. It's you're going to you're going to think that it's going to go up and then all of a sudden it's going to go down the next day which actually makes this prime for like selling premium for for a little and probably prime for selling premium around that 415 420 area cuz so if you do do that I would actually say this might be a perfect time for you to do something like that on on Tesla cuz this between 4:15 and 430 area. Actually, that's [clears throat] going to be a trouble zone for for a while on Tesla.</p>
