title: 加拿大汽车业的未来：应否超越北美三大巨头，转向中国市场？兼谈《速度与激情》系列电影的幕后故事
---

### 加拿大汽车业的挑战与Stellantis争议

上个月，美国汽车制造商**Stellantis**（一家跨国汽车制造公司，由菲亚特克莱斯勒汽车和PSA集团合并而成）宣布将采取一项重大举措，从字面上看，这是一次大规模的转移。该公司计划将一款**Jeep**（吉普：Stellantis旗下的一个越野车品牌）车型的生产从**Brampton**（布兰普顿：加拿大安大略省的一个城市）转移到**Illinois**（伊利诺伊州：美国中西部的一个州）。去年，布兰普顿工厂在为生产Jeep Compass做准备而关闭之前，曾雇佣了大约3000名工人。毫不夸张地说，渥太华对此非常不满，并正在启动一个正式的争议解决程序。

<p class="english-text">Last month, US automaker Stellantis announced it would be making a big move. Literally. The company intends to shift production of a Jeep model from Brampton to Illinois. About 3000 workers were employed at the Brampton plant before it shut down last year to get ready for the Jeep Compass. Ottawa is not pleased, to put it mildly, and it's now launching a formal dispute resolution process.</p>

本期节目的第一个议题是：政府在此事中胜算几何？这将对安大略省的工人和该省的汽车产业意味着什么？

汽车是一项大生意，它们也是娱乐业的一部分。它们推动了环球影业最成功的系列电影《速度与激情》的成功。一部许多人认为会失败的电影，是如何催生出了一系列续集，累计票房超过70亿美元，并在此过程中改变了电影业的呢？欢迎收看《The Rundown》。

<p class="english-text">Then cars are big business. They're also show business. They've powered the success of Universal's biggest franchise, "The Fast and the Furious." How did a film many assumed would be a clunker drive, the creation of a fleet of sequels that have racked up more than $7 billion and changed the movie business along the way? Welcome to "The Rundown."</p>
</details>

联邦政府正在挑战Stellantis公司将其Jeep Compass车型生产线南移的决定。现在是时候让加拿大超越“三大”汽车制造商了吗？我们是否应该转而拥抱中国蓬勃发展的汽车产业？我向**Greig Mordue**（格雷格·莫杜：麦克马斯特大学W. Booth工程实践与技术学院副教授，曾任丰田汽车加拿大制造公司总经理）提出了这些问题。格雷格，欢迎来到节目，你今天过得怎么样？

<p class="english-text">The federal government is challenging Stellantis decision to shift production of the Jeep Compass down south. Is it time for Canada to look beyond the Big Three automakers? Should we embrace China's ascendant auto industry instead? I asked Greig Mordue, associate professor in the W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology at McMaster University and former general manager at Toyota motor Manufacturing Canada. Greg, welcome to the program. How are you doing today?</p>
</details>

Greig Mordue: 很好，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Good. Glad to be here.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 我想从渥太华和Stellantis公司开始谈起。渥太华正在对Stellantis公司启动一项争议解决程序，原因是该公司将原计划的车辆生产从布兰普顿转移到美国。这有任何实质性的约束力吗？这项举措能否有效地追究他们的责任？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to start with Ottawa and Stellantis. Ottawa is launching a dispute resolution process against Stellantis for moving a planned vehicle production from Brampton to the US. Does this have any teeth? Does does this move anything substantial to hold them accountable?</p>
</details>

Greig Mordue: 嗯，每一份协议都不同，我确信Stellantis公司为他们在**Windsor**（温莎：加拿大安大略省的一个城市）的工作，以及我们具体讨论的布兰普顿的扩展项目，还有他们与**LG**（一家韩国跨国企业集团）在温莎合资建设电池工厂的项目，都签署了协议。所以所有这些协议都会有所不同。它们之间可能有一些联系，但我不知道具体细节，他们也没有分享，这被认为是专有信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, every one of those agreements are different, and I'm sure that Stellantis signed agreements for their for their work in Windsor and their extension of what we're talking specifically about in Brampton, as well as their joint venture with LG to to build batteries in Windsor. So all of those will be different. They may have some connections between the two of them. I don't know the details of that. They haven't shared them. They it's considered proprietary,</p>
</details>

但我过去研究过这些协议，它们通常是这样资助的：如果有一项协议规定你将引入这项技术，你将生产这个产品，如果你满足了要求并投入了资金，加拿大政府和安大略省政府就会以实物形式提供资金。如果你没有做到，那么你们就会讨论下一步该怎么做，或者改变计划。计划确实会随着时间的推移而改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I've looked at those in the past and they typically are they they are funded in such a way that if you know, there's an agreement, you're going to bring this technology, you're going to build this product. And if you meet your requirements and you spend the money, the Government of Canada and the province of Ontario will send the funds in kind. And when and if you don't do that, you'll have some kind of a discussion about what to do going forward or change plans. Change and plans do change as they go through.</p>
</details>

目前的问题，据我所知，就布兰普顿而言，是他们资助了1.1亿加元。这听起来很多，不仅仅是零花钱。但坦率地说，如果Stellantis公司最终被告知，要离开布兰普顿需要支付1.1亿加元，我想他们可能会说“我们走”。所以你必须小心你所要求的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The issue is at this point, from what I understand, insofar as the Brampton is concerned, is that they funded $110 million. Sounds like a lot. It's more than walking around change. But if, frankly, if Stellantis comes through this and someone says for you to get out of Brampton, it's going to cost you $110 million. I think they'll probably say we're out of there. So you got to be careful what you ask for.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，坦率地说，我认为加拿大政府对Stellantis公司施加压力并不是一件坏事。我的意思是，这首先也是最令人满意的一点是，它能让他们承担责任。但坦率地说，通过让他们承担责任，这可能会促使他们说：“听着，我们对布兰普顿没有任何计划。”承认他们对布兰普顿没有任何计划。坦率地说，他们将帮助那些拿着每小时45加元工资或希望拿到这种工资的现有员工，让他们能够解除束缚，坦率地继续他们的生活。他们越早做到这一点，虽然会很艰难，对每个人来说都很困难。坦率地说，我坐在这里发表这样的声明很容易，但这能让他们继续前进，因为布兰普顿没有人愿意雇佣任何每小时挣45加元的人，因为他们知道，可以理解的是，一旦被召回，他们第二天就会离开。所以这是一颗难以下咽的药丸，但也许这是工业部长为这次对话带来的一个积极的方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, I don't think it's a terrible thing, frankly, for the government of Canada to put the put pressure on Stellantis. I mean, the first and perhaps most satisfying aspect of that is it holds their feet to the fire. But by holding their feet to the fire, frankly, it it may cause them to say, listen, we don't have anything for Brampton. Admit that they don't have anything for Brampton. And frankly, they'll be doing those employees, their existing employees that are hanging on with those $45 an hour jobs, or the promise of the hope of those $45 an hour jobs, they'll be able to cut their ties and get and, frankly, get on with their lives. And and the sooner they can do that, it'll be tough. It's difficult for everyone. Frankly, it's easy for me to sit here and and make that pronouncement, but it allows them to do to go forward because nobody in Brampton wants to hire anybody that makes $45 an hour because they know, understandably, that they're gone the very next day when they get called back. So it's a it's a it's a tough pill, but in, in in but perhaps it's a positive attribute of what the industry minister has added to the conversation.</p>

### 加拿大汽车业的历史教训与“汽车协定”

TVO Today: 谈到难以下咽的药丸，我们现在是否应该讨论一下加拿大人对美国“三大”汽车制造商（**D3**，即通用汽车、福特和克莱斯勒，后来克莱斯勒成为Stellantis的一部分）应该抱有多大的信心？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, speaking of tough pills to swallow. Is there a conversation right now that we should be having about how much faith we should Canadians should have in the big three US automakers right now?</p>
</details>

Greig Mordue: 嗯，通常人们会说，在2000年或1999年，那是加拿大汽车工业的鼎盛时期，我们在这个国家生产了300万辆汽车。其中绝大多数是由D3生产的。去年，加拿大生产了130万辆汽车。最大的制造商是**Toyota**（丰田：一家日本跨国汽车制造商），位居第一。第二名是**Honda**（本田：一家日本跨国汽车制造商）。他们贡献了大约这个国家四分之三的产量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's common to say that in the year 2000, which or 1999, which was the the high water mark for the Canadian auto industry, we made 3 million vehicles in this country. The vast majority of those were made by the D3. Last year we made 1.3 million vehicles in Canada. The big the big manufacturers were Toyota at number one. And number two was was Honda. They were responsible. Excuse me for about three-quarters of the production in this country.</p>
</details>

所以，我们一直不断地听到D3的承诺和声明，而与此同时，他们的产量却在稳步下降。坦率地说，Stellantis公司仍在温莎坚持。那基本上是他们的制造基地，也是加拿大最大的D3制造工厂。但**General Motors**（通用汽车：一家美国跨国汽车制造商）的产量已经从本世纪初在**Oshawa**（奥沙瓦：加拿大安大略省的一个城市）的超过一百万辆，包括一百万辆的生产，下降到今天的约10万辆。他们曾经是加拿大最大的汽车制造商，现在是第四大。坦率地说，如果不是**Ford**（福特：一家美国跨国汽车制造商）现在什么都不生产，他们会是第五大，也就是最小的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we've had a steady diet of promises and pronouncements by the D3 and, and corresponding with that is a steady decline in their production. Frankly. You know, Stellantis is still hanging in there in Windsor. That's basically their foot, their manufacturing footprint. And that's the largest D3 manufacturing outlet in Canada. But General Motors has gone from well over a million, including a million in production in Oshawa in the early parts of this century, to a rump of about 100,000 today. They they used to be the largest automaker in Canada. Now they're the fourth largest. Frankly, they'd be the fifth largest. In other words, the smallest. If it weren't for the fact that Ford isn't making anything right now.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 我希望我们能继续讨论这个话题。我希望你能给我们上一堂历史课。这并非加拿大汽车工业第一次面临挑战。请带我们回顾一下50年代和60年代，以及我们是如何度过那段时期，我们能从中吸取什么教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want us to stay on this page. I'm hoping you can give us a bit of a history lesson here. This isn't the first time that Canada's auto industry has faced challenges. Take us back to the '50s and '60s and how that how we've sort of come through that and what we can learn from theirs.</p>
</details>

Greig Mordue: 所以，从加拿大政府，主要是安大略省政府在50年代末、60年代初采取的产业政策措施中，我们可以学到很多宝贵的经验。当时，汽车工业开始遭受打击。我们对来自美国的车辆征收17.5%的关税，这基本上创造了一个环境，如果你想在加拿大销售汽车，你就必须在加拿大生产。因此，加拿大人可以理解地感到有些困惑，因为他们为基本相同的车辆支付了更高的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So there are a lot of good lessons to be learned from the industrial policy measures that the governments of Canada, primarily alongside the government of Ontario, have have taken us back in the late '50s, early '60s there, the industry was starting to suffer. It had we had 17.5, I believe, percent tariffs on vehicles coming in from from the US, which essentially made for an environment where if you wanted to sell a car in Canada, you had to make that car in Canada. So Canadians were understandably a little, a little flummoxed because they were paying more for essentially the same vehicles.</p>
</details>

因为当你无法实现规模经济时，你就无法以有竞争力的价格提供产品。与此同时，当时欧洲货币贬值，欧洲车辆大量涌入。接着经济也陷入困境。所有这些都意味着加拿大汽车工业的就业开始急剧下降。因此，工业界承受了巨大的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because when you can't achieve economies of scale, you can't you can't offer products at a competitive price. Meanwhile, we had the devaluation of of of currencies in Europe at that time, and we had a had a influx of European vehicles. And then and then the economy was suffering. And so all that meant was that the that employment started to crater in the Canadian auto industry. So there was pressure placed upon the industry.</p>
</details>

所以加拿大所做的，就是加拿大通常会做的事情：成立一个皇家委员会，然后稍微拖延一下。**Vincent Bladen**（文森特·布莱登：加拿大经济学家，曾主持皇家委员会调查汽车工业）被任命为皇家专员，他听取了许多有趣的意见，包括加拿大汽车工人联合会（**United Auto Workers of Canada**：加拿大一个代表汽车工人的工会）的陈述，他们认为我们应该拥有一家加拿大自己的汽车公司，这在当时和现在可能都会引起共鸣。但最终，所有这些讨论催生了1965年的**Auto Pact**（汽车协定：加拿大和美国之间的一项自由贸易协定，旨在整合北美汽车工业）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what Canada did was what Canada does is set up a royal commission and kick it down the road a little bit. And Vincent Bladen, I'm going to tell you lots of stories. Vincent Bladen was appointed the the royal commissioner and he heard lots of interesting things, including the a presentation from United Auto Workers of Canada that we should have a Canadian-owned automobile company which which will probably resonate in local times and current times as well. But ultimately from out of all of that came something called the Auto Pact in 1965.</p>
</details>

它的实施方式是，你需要在加拿大生产一辆汽车，才能在加拿大销售一辆汽车，不一定非得是同一辆车。但如果你是一家每年在加拿大销售10万辆汽车的公司，你就必须承诺每年在加拿大生产10万辆汽车，并确保你不仅仅是从美国等地进口车辆，然后装上一些轮毂盖就说“看，我们造出来了”。我们要求每辆车必须有60%的加拿大附加值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the way it was implemented is you needed to to make a vehicle in Canada for everyone you sold didn't need to be the vehicle. But if you if you were a company selling 100,000 vehicles a year in Canada, you had to commit to make 100,000 vehicles a year in Canada and to make sure that you weren't just bringing in vehicles from the US, for example, and putting some hubcaps on them, for example, and saying, there we made it, here it we had a 60% Canadian value added for every for, for the vehicles.</p>
</details>

### 展望未来：中国汽车业的吸引力

TVO Today: 在你的研究中，你可能已经看到中国似乎是加拿大汽车工业一个非常有吸引力的合作伙伴。请告诉我们为什么我们可能、应该或者为什么我们应该朝着这个方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In your research, you have probably seen that China looks like a very attractive partner for Canada in the auto industry. Tell us why we may, should or why we should be looking in that direction.</p>
</details>

Greig Mordue: 嗯，如果你纯粹从汽车产业政策的角度来看，毫无疑问，中国是我们应该追求的方向。当然会有各种各样的人不同意我的看法，但我们需要进行这场辩论。我理解中国在许多其他方面也很困难，我们不需要，我也不会深入讨论这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, if you look at it purely from the perspective of of automotive industrial policy, there's no question China is the is the is the avenue we should pursue. And there will be all kinds of people that disagree with me about that. And we need but we need to have that debate. I understand that China is difficult for lots of other reasons as well, and we don't need to, and I won't get into those.</p>
</details>

但如果我们遵循你我所经历的教训，即首先在60年代与美国，其次在80年代与日本，现在则明确地与新兴的汽车制造商建立联系，特别是当我们进入移动出行电气化时代时。我们在北美的发展速度不如世界其他地区。但如果我们朝着这个方向发展，中国显然是领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But China, if we follow the lessons that you and I have gone through between attaching ourselves to the strongest or ascendant auto makers first in the '60s with the US, second in the '80s with Japan, and now clearly the ascendant auto maker, particularly as we move into the electrification of mobility. We're not moving as quickly in in North America as the rest of the world. But if we move in that direction, China is clearly the leader.</p>
</details>

例如，我自己的研究表明，过去十年中，中国在汽车专利方面的产生速度大约是美国的5比1。所以，你可以在一段时间内不以与竞争对手相同的程度进行创新，并且保持良好。但从长远来看，美国汽车工业没有任何迹象表明它将成为未来的全球领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My own research, for example, shows that China generates automotive patents and have had and have for the past decade at a rate of about 5 to 1 over the US. So you can get away with, with, with not innovating for to the same degree as your competitors for a while and and be okay. But over the long term, there's nothing about the US auto industry that suggests that it is going to be a global leader going forward.</p>
</details>

而且美国目前的产业政策措施或能源政策措施，也没有任何迹象表明继续将我们的产业与美国产业捆绑在一起是最好的选择。所以我知道中国因许多不同的原因而充满挑战，但如果我们纯粹从我们希望身处何处来看待这个问题，那么我们希望加拿大拥有一个汽车工业吗？我们需要进行这场对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's nothing about the US industrial policy measures or the energy policy measures that suggest that the that tethering continuing to try to tether our industry to the US industry is the best bet. So I know China is challenging for lots of different reasons, but if we're looking at it pure, from where do we want to be in? So do we want an auto industry in Canada? We need to have that conversation.</p>

### 《速度与激情》系列电影：现象级成功

TVO Today: 一部讲述街头赛车手的小成本电影是如何催生出有史以来最受欢迎的系列电影之一的呢？《The Rundown》的制片人**Colin Ellis**（科林·埃利斯）与记者兼作家**Barry Hertz**（巴里·赫兹）谈论了他的书《欢迎来到这个家族：速度与激情背后的爆炸性故事，那些为世界增添动力的票房大片》，讲述了这个系列如何让好莱坞改变了策略。

</details>

TVO Today: 你是什么时候开始对《速度与激情》感兴趣的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> When did you become interested in "The Fast and the Furious"?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我想最初的兴趣萌芽是在2001年，当时我还是一个十几岁的电影院工作人员。那个夏天，我可能累计看了第一部电影15到20次，都是零散的片段拼凑起来的。我真的很喜欢它。我一直是个喜欢看大片的人。即使小时候，我也喜欢大片，喜欢艺术电影，喜欢外语片，喜欢独立电影。而关于快车、酷男、辣妹、抢劫的一切，都让我产生了共鸣，我就是这样一直追随着这个系列。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think the first flicker of interest was when I was a teenage movie theatre worker back in 2001. Over the course of that summer, I probably saw the first one 1520 times cumulatively in little chunks stitched together. And I just really kind of dug it. I was always a big tent kind of moviegoer. Even as a kid, I like blockbusters, I like arthouse, I like foreign language, I like indie. And something about, you know, fast cars, cool guys, hot women, heists, it all kind of clicked, and I just kind of kept going with the series.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 那么你为什么想写一本关于它的书呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So why did you want to write a book about it?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 嗯，我当时想，我一直想写一本关于电影行业的书，因为我最终成为了一名评论家、作家和记者，但我一直在努力思考，感觉所有那些大电影都有书写过了，你知道，你可以找到一百万本关于《**The Godfather**》（《教父》：一部经典的美国犯罪电影）的书，一百万本关于**Spielberg**（斯皮尔伯格：著名美国电影导演）的书。但后来我开始想，嗯，你知道吗？以前没有人写过《速度与激情》。我越想，就越意识到它有一个非常有趣的弧线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I was thinking I always wanted to kind of write some kind of book about the film industry being eventually becoming a critic and a writer and a journalist, and I was struggling to think it was like all the kind of movies the big movies had books about, you know, you can find a million books about "The Godfather," a million books about Spielberg. But then I started thinking I was like, well, you know what? No one's ever written about "Fast" before. And the more I thought about it, the more I realised there's quite an interesting arc to it.</p>
</details>

它不仅讲述了这个系列如何从一部带有三人行笑话的小街头赛车电影，演变为一部征服世界的、充满间谍动作的票房大片，而且幕后的戏剧也同样引人入胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not only how the series evolved itself from this, like little piddly street racing movie with threesome jokes until, like, this world conquering, spy action filled blockbuster. But the off screen drama of it all was fascinating too.</p>
</details>

### 系列起源与好莱坞影响

TVO Today: 实际上是谁创作了《速度与激情》？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Who actually authored "The Fast and the Furious"?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 嗯，我觉得任何成功都会有无数的作者想要居功。我的意思是，这一切都始于一个被遗忘的知识产权，那就是1998年**Vibe Magazine**（《氛围杂志》：一本美国音乐和娱乐杂志）上由纽约作家**Kenneth Lee**（肯尼斯·李）撰写的一篇文章。肯·李当时是一名小报记者，报道城市犯罪，他偶然发现了皇后区的一个街头赛车亚文化群体，他为《Vibe》杂志写了一篇关于它的文章，这篇文章传到了**Universal**（环球影业：一家美国电影制片公司）的高管手中，他们买下了版权。然后，在编剧署名方面就变得非常复杂，因为这个想法和提案经过了数十人之手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I feel like with any success, you find there's like a million different authors who want to take credit for it. I mean, it all starts with a very forgotten piece of intellectual property, which is a 1998 Vibe Magazine article by a New York writer called Kenneth Lee. And Ken Lee was a tabloid journalist at the time, writing about crime in the city, and he happened upon this subculture of street racers out in Queens, basically, and he wrote an article about it for Vibe, and that article made its way to Universal executives who optioned it. And then you get really tricky in terms of what the screenwriter credits are, because it's that idea. And pitch went through upwards of dozens of people.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 《速度与激情》系列电影对过去20多年来的好莱坞有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How important is "The Fast and the Furious" franchise to, say, the last 20-plus years of Hollywood?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我想如果你真的深入思考，明年它就将迎来四分之一世纪的生日，这既令人瞩目又荒谬。它确实反映了过去25年好莱坞的整体发展。我们看到电影制作人越来越依赖这种相互关联的电影宇宙，一部电影引出另一部，不同时间线的角色突然出现，以提升观众兴趣，让你一路追随冒险。我的意思是，《速度与激情》确实走在了这方面的前沿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think if you were really to think about it deeply, it will be a quarter century old next year, which is kind of remarkable and preposterous at the same time. Really do mirror the past 25 years of Hollywood in general. We've seen filmmakers increasingly rely on these kind of connected cinematic universes, where one film leads to another and characters from a different kind of almost timeline pop in so that it boosts audience interest and makes you tag along for the adventure. I mean, "Fast" was really at the forefront of that.</p>
</details>

我们看到了许多努力去触及更广泛、更多样化的观众群体，《速度与激情》在“多样性”这个词成为电影公司口号之前，就已经自然而然地做到了这一点。我们还看到了国际市场的巨大扩张。你知道，很多电影都在吸引中国市场，吸引南美市场，确保这些电影在北美市场之外获得更多票房，而它们通常被局限于北美市场。《速度与激情》在其他任何电影之前，就已经做到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've seen a lot of efforts to reach wider, more diverse audiences, and fast was doing that organically, naturally, before even the word diverse was kind of like a studio watchword. And we've seen a lot of expansion into international markets. You know, a lot of appealing to the Chinese market, appealing to South America, making sure that these films get more money outside of the North American circuit that they were typically locked into. And "Fast" was doing that before really anybody.</p>

### 多样性、粉丝文化与创意演变

TVO Today: 当你看这部电影时，它们是令人难以置信的多样化。这是偶然的还是有意为之？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> When you watch the movie, they are incredibly diverse. Was that was that by accident or was that by design?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 这取决于你和谁交谈。当你深入研究第一部电影的起源时，我觉得大多数人认为这是“快乐的设计”。他们当时正在尝试重现这种亚文化，编剧**David Ayer**（大卫·艾亚：美国电影编剧、导演）和导演**Rob Cohen**（罗伯·科恩：美国电影导演）对南加州进行了深入研究，他们发现那里主要是拉丁裔、亚裔孩子、黑人孩子、混血孩子。每个人都差不多，肤色并不重要，重要的是你的引擎大小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It kind of depends on who you talk to. When you get into the origins of the first film, I feel most people are of the mind that it was by Happy Design. They were talking about they were trying to recreate this subculture in which, you know, the writer David Ayer and the director, Rob Cohen did some heavy research into into Southern California, and they found that it was very much Latinos. It was Asian kids, it was black kids, it was mixed kids. It was everybody was kind of it didn't matter the colour of your skin so much as the size of your engine.</p>
</details>

所以他们非常刻意地为第一部电影选角，以反映这种文化，并努力保持真实性。后来随着电影规模的扩大，这就不再仅仅是为了粗俗地针对不同的人口群体，而更多地是：“好吧，这就是我们现有的人，这就是我们认为在银幕上合作得很好的人，让我们组建一个像**United Colors of Benetton**（贝纳通联合色彩：一个以多元文化和包容性著称的时尚品牌）一样的超级团队，它恰好能自然地吸引不同的市场。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so they cast that first film very deliberately to reflect that culture and to try to stay as authentic as they could. And then as the films got bigger, it wasn't necessarily so much about appealing to crassly targeting different demographics as more so like, okay, here's the people we have and here's who we think work well together on screen, and let's just build up this kind of United Colours of Benetton super team that happened to just, you know, naturally appeal to different marketplaces.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 我想你曾经说过，也在书中提到，这些电影大多没有像《星球大战》或DC漫画系列那样，沾染上其他电影系列的一些负面毒性。你这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think you've said and said in the book that the films have mostly stayed clean of some of the toxicity that other movie franchises like Star Wars or DC seem to have. What did you mean by that?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我觉得在线粉丝群体，尤其是在过去五六年左右，当你拥有像《**Star Wars**》（《星球大战》：一个著名的科幻电影系列）这样备受喜爱的作品，它能激发出如此狂热的激情时，当你稍微改变一些东西，让它更具多样性、更具现代感、更具进步性时，你就会在一个对作品如此依恋的特定群体中激发出大量的负面情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I feel like the online fandoms, particularly over the past five, six years or so, when you have like a beloved property like Star Wars that engenders such rabid passion, when you switch things up a little bit to maybe be a little more diverse, a little bit more contemporary, a little bit more progressive, you engender you, you really engender a lot of toxicity among a certain community that can feel so attached to, attached to a property.</p>
</details>

所以当你知道《星球大战》系列把**Rey**（蕾伊：星球大战系列中的女性绝地武士）塑造成一个女性**Jedi**（绝地武士：星球大战宇宙中的光明面使用者）时，这显然是你能做的最糟糕的事情。但《速度与激情》的粉丝们，因为它的多样化社区是其内在的一部分，只要你能开车，每个人都可以加入，所以这从来都不是一个真正的问题。他们只是想看到这个系列成长和扩展。对于这个家庭，家庭是这些电影的一个关键元素，无论是血缘家庭还是选择的家庭，每个人都受到欢迎。这是一个盛大的、开放的家庭派对。如果你会开车，你就可以加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you know the Star Wars stuff, did Rey as a as a female Jedi, that was apparently the worst thing in the world you could possibly do. But the "Fast" fans, because it's kind of baked-in with like that more diverse community everybody can join so long as you can drive that. It was never really a problem necessarily. They just wanted to see the franchise grow and expand. And for that family. And again, family is such a key element of these films in that both the organic family and the found family, that everybody was welcome. It was a big kind of open family party. And if you could drive, you can come along.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 但不像其他电影系列，比如《**The Lord of the Rings**》（《指环王》：一部著名的奇幻电影系列）或《**Harry Potter**》（《哈利·波特》：一部著名的奇幻电影系列），它们没有所谓的“法则”，对吧？这些电影没有神话背景可供借鉴。所以我一直想知道，他们是如何不断想出故事的？我的意思是，如果它们基本上只是街头赛车和抢劫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But unlike other film series like the "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter," there's not like a law, right? Like there's no mythology for these movies to really draw from. So I've always wondered, like, how do they keep coming up with stories? I mean, if they're just basically street racing and heists.</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我的意思是，这正是它的伟大之处。它们不受任何神话或传说的束缚。没有像《星球大战》宇宙那样你必须遵守的时间线，比如**Battle of Yavin**（雅文战役：星球大战中的一场关键战役）就在那里。所以他们不能在那时做那些事情，对吧？是的。你真正想做的就是看这些人开车，完成这些疯狂的特技。所以很多电影实际上是先构建这些大型场景，然后围绕它们反向设计故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, that's the that's the great thing, though. They're not beholden to any kind of mythology or lore. There's there's not like this Star Wars universe you have to abide by in terms of timelines, like the Battle of Yavin is there. So they can't be doing that at that time, right? Yeah. There's really all you want to do is see these guys drive and pull off these crazy stunts. So a lot of the films really are. They construct these big set pieces first, and then they kind of reverse engineer the story around it.</p>
</details>

对于第五部电影，这个系列真正达到了一个新的高度，他们认识到：“好吧，前几部有很多街头赛车，但我们能做的也只有这么多，让一个人比另一个人更快地从A点开到B点。”所以，让我们提高赌注，把它变成一部抢劫电影。让这些人真正有一个任务。一个不可能完成的任务，有人可能会说，就像**Ethan Hunt**（伊森·亨特：《碟中谍》系列电影的主角）那样。这正是他们开始升级的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for the fifth film, which is where the franchise really kind of levelled up, they recognised that, okay, the first for a lot of street racing in there, there's only so much we can do from having a guy drive from point A to point B faster than the other. So let's up the ante. Let's turn it into a heist film. Let's make these guys actually have a mission. An impossible mission, one might say, in the Ethan Hunt mould. And that's really where they kind of started levelling up.</p>
</details>

### 女性角色与明星效应

TVO Today: 我想问你关于这些电影中的女性角色，特别是**Michelle Rodriguez**（米歇尔·罗德里格兹）和**Jordana Brewster**（乔丹娜·布鲁斯特）从一开始就在。后来你又看到了**Charlize Theron**（查理兹·塞隆）和我最喜欢的**Helen Mirren**（海伦·米伦）。哦，当然，是的，但她们不一定像男性角色那样处于这些电影的中心。我只是想知道你是否认为《速度与激情》系列电影对它的女性角色，以及由此延伸到她们的粉丝，造成了不良影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to ask you about women in these movies, notably, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster have been from the very beginning. Later you get Charlize Theron and my favourite, Helen Mirren. Oh of course, yeah, but they're not necessarily at the centre at the of these films the way that the men have. And I'm just wondering if you think the "Fast and Furious" movies has done a disservice to its female characters and by extension, their fans?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我的意思是，百分之百，当然。我认为这是米歇尔·罗德里格兹一直以来在媒体上公开批评这个系列的问题。我记得有一次，大概是在第七部和第八部电影之间，她站出来说：“听着，如果你不开始给我们更多的事情做，不增加更多不是仅仅作为浪漫对象的女性角色，我就不干了。”值得称赞的是，他们确实开始在这方面做了一些努力，特别是给了乔丹娜和米歇尔饰演的角色之间更多的对话和互动，而不仅仅是谈论她们生命中的男人。但这是一个大问题，从一开始就是，但如果米歇尔在第一部电影制作期间没有站出来说：“好吧，我在这里真的只是被塑造成一个性感对象，给我一些可以深入挖掘的东西。”那么情况可能会更糟。尽管在最终的电影中，她的角色戏份很轻，但本来可能会更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, 100%, certainly. And I think this was something that Michelle Rodriguez, who was very vocal about anything and everything in the press, has publicly taken the franchise to task over. And there was at one point, I believe it was between film seven and eight where she went out there and said, like, listen, if you're not going to start giving us more to do and adding more women to the picture who are not just, you know, romantic objects, I'm out. And to their credit, they did start to work in a little bit more and give especially the characters played by Jordana and Michelle, a little bit more dialogue between them and interactions that didn't just involve talking about the men in their lives, but it is a it is a big problem. It has been since the beginning, but it was going to be even worse if Michelle hadn't spoken up during the production of the first film and said, like, well, I'm really just being characterised here as this sex object, give me something to sink my teeth into a little bit. And as light as it was in the final film, it could have been much worse.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 那么我们来谈谈更多的明星，因为很明显，这些电影的成功某种程度上依赖于**Vin Diesel**（范·迪塞尔：美国演员，在《速度与激情》系列中饰演主角多米尼克·托雷托）。他是如何被选中的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, let's talk about more about the stars, because obviously these movies kind of rest on the shoulders of Vin Diesel. How did he come to be cast?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 这是一个有趣的故事。最初，环球影业看中了**Timothy Olyphant**（蒂莫西·奥利芬特：美国演员），当时他们对他非常看好，他刚拍完**Doug Liman**（道格·里曼：美国电影导演）的电影《**Go!**》（《够姜二人组》）。他后来还有一部主题非常相似的电影《**Gone In 60 Seconds**》（《极速60秒》）上映。可以说是一个有趣的选择。我个人是蒂莫西·奥利芬特的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's kind of an interesting story. Originally, the studio Universal had their eyes on Timothy Olyphant, who they were very hot on at the time, coming off of Doug Liman's "Go!" He also had the very similarly themed "Gone In 60 Seconds" coming out a little bit later. Kind of a interesting choice, let's say. And I'm a big Timothy Olyphant fan.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 是的，我也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Me too.</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 但他们需要一个更神秘、更有魅力的演员。于是**Vin Diesel**（范·迪塞尔）出现了。但在第一部电影上映时，他在行业内也有一些问题性的声誉，与导演发生过冲突，有点自我膨胀的问题。我的意思是，我们谈论的是一个从未主演过电影的人。他最多只是配角。他在《**Saving Private Ryan**》（《拯救大兵瑞恩》：一部著名的二战电影）中获得了重大突破。他刚刚拍完《**Pitch Black**》（《星际传奇》：一部科幻动作电影），那可以算是他的第一个主角角色，但那是一部相对小成本的电影。然而，他身上有一种魅力，尤其是与首先被选中的**Paul Walker**（保罗·沃克：美国演员，在《速度与激情》系列中饰演布莱恩·奥康纳）的能量碰撞时，这种魅力更加突出。这部电影最初是围绕保罗·沃克打造的，从未打算成为范·迪塞尔的明星项目。保罗从第一天起就在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But they needed somebody who was a little bit more mysterious, had a little bit more allure to him. And along comes Vin Diesel. But he also had something of a problematic reputation around the industry at the time of the first film, butted heads with directors. Had a little bit of an ego problem. And I mean, we're talking about a guy who had not led a film. Like he was supporting roles at best. Like he got a big break with "Saving Private Ryan." He was just had finished "Pitch Black," which was, I guess you could call it, his first lead role, but a relatively small movie. And yet there was something about him, the magnetism, and especially one that bounced off the energy of Paul Walker, who was cast first, and who this was really the person who the vehicle was built around. It was never intended as a Vin Diesel star project. Paul was there from day one.</p>
</details>

### 保罗·沃克的逝世与数字复活

TVO Today: 我提到了保罗·沃克，这个系列电影的悲剧之一是他在拍摄《**Furious 7**》（《速度与激情7》）期间去世了。他们是如何在没有他的情况下完成这部电影的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mentioned Paul Walker, and one of the tragedies of this series is that he passed in the middle of making "Furious 7." How did they finish the movie without him?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我的意思是，这对整个行业来说是一个可怕且前所未有的情况。不仅是他英年早逝的悲剧，更讽刺的是，这发生在一场车祸中，而这部电影正是关于车祸的。对吧？所以当这件事发生时，大约在感恩节假期期间，他们已经完成了《速度与激情7》的一半，还有很多场景需要他拍摄，所以他们必须做出决定。我们是要放弃这部电影吗？我们是要尝试重拍吗？或者我们该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, that was kind of a horrible and unprecedented situation for the industry at large. Not only was there just the tragedy of losing him so young, there was the horrible irony of it happening in a car crash in a movie about car crashes. Right? So when that happened and it was around Thanksgiving break, they were about halfway through finishing "Furious 7" and there was still a lot of scenes that he needed to shoot, so they had to make a decision. Are we going to scrap the movie? Are we going to try to recreate it? Or how are we going to do this?</p>
</details>

所以很多非常聪明的人聚集在一起，想出了一个办法：他们可以结合实际效果和视觉效果来完成。他们请来了他的两个弟弟，**Caleb**（迦勒·沃克）和**Cody**（科迪·沃克）。一个与他的脸部很匹配，另一个与他的身体更匹配。他们把两人结合起来。他们还会找另一位演员，他也与保罗很契合，帮助他们适应表演风格。他们将提取保罗·沃克所有被拍摄下来的档案资料，无论是分钟还是秒，然后利用这些素材进行数字处理。他们就是这样做的。他们可以说，为了避免更好的说法，在电影中“僵尸化”了保罗·沃克，并完成了这部电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a lot of very smart people came together, figured out they could do it with a mix of practical and visual effects. Will get his two younger brothers onto the set, Caleb and Cody. One was a good match for his face, one was a better match for his body. Kind of smushed them together. We'll have another actor who was also kind of a good fit for Paul. Kind of helped them adjust to the acting styles. We're going to take every single archival minute or second of Paul Walker that's ever been captured on film, and we're going to take that, and we're going to extract all that footage and digitally manipulate it. And that's kind of what they did. They kind of, for lack of a better term, zombified Paul Walker as a being cinematically and finish the film.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 这是否让好莱坞走上了某种程度上数字“复活”演员的道路？因为我们已经在《星球大战》电影中看到了这一点。**Carrie Fisher**（凯丽·费雪：美国演员，在星球大战系列中饰演莱娅公主）显然在《**Rise of Skywalker**》（《星球大战：天行者崛起》）上映前去世了。**Ian Holm**（伊恩·霍姆：英国演员）在《**Alien: Romulus**》（《异形：罗慕路斯》）中被“复活”了。那么《速度与激情》系列是否也应该被认为开启了好莱坞的这条道路？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Did this sort of set Hollywood on a path of digitally resurrecting actors in some way, because, I mean, we've seen this with with the Star Wars movies. Carrie Fisher obviously died before "Rise of Skywalker" came out. Ian Holm was resurrected for "Alien: Romulus." Is "Fast"-- Could they be given credit for also starting Hollywood on this path, too?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我的意思是，就他们所做到的程度而言，是的。以前也曾以非常有限的方式做过，但他们当时确实是在即时发明技术和实践。你知道，我为这本书采访过的一个人，他非常深入地参与了那里的视觉效果制作，当然，他并不认为他们走在了**AI deepfake**（人工智能深度伪造：一种利用人工智能技术生成或修改图像、音频或视频的技术，使其看起来真实但实际上是伪造的）潮流的前沿。但他们确实是，这就是我们今天的现状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, to the degree that they were doing it, yes, it had been done before in very limited fashion, but they were really inventing technology and practices on the fly as they were doing this. And, you know, one of the people I spoke to for the book, who was very heavily involved in the visual effects there, you know, of course, didn't think that they were, you know, at the forefront of this AI deep fake train. But they were and that's where we are today.</p>
</details>

这也是为什么当像范·迪塞尔这样的人走到人群中说：“下一部电影，我们要带回**Brian O'Conner**（布莱恩·奥康纳：保罗·沃克在《速度与激情》系列中饰演的角色），我们要带回保罗·沃克的角色。”时，粉丝社区会出现一些令人不安的情绪。好吧，你们要怎么做？很可能以一种让很多人感到不安的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why you have some troubling, you know, emotions in the fan community when someone like Vin Diesel goes out to a crowd and says, for the next one, I'm we're bringing back Brian O'Conner, we're bringing back Paul Walker's character. Okay. How are you doing that? Probably in a way that is going to be disturbing to a lot of people.</p>
</details>

### 系列现状与未来展望

TVO Today: 我们自2023年以来就没有看到《速度与激情》电影了。这个系列的现状如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, we haven't seen a "Fast" movie since 2023. Fast. What's the status of the series?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 情况不太好。部分原因是它一直处于一种“深度冻结”状态，因为他们一直在努力解决经济问题。这些电影的制作成本变得如此之高，因为演员阵容要求高额片酬。到目前为止，他们在世界各地几十个地点拍摄。特技工作、特效工作，所有这些都加起来了。这甚至还没有算上营销成本。而这些数字已经不“合理”了，就像孩子们常说的那样。所以它因此被冻结了一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's not great. Partially it's been in a kind of deep freeze because they've been trying to figure out the economics of it. These movies have become so expensive to make because the cast demands so much money. By this point they shoot it in dozens of locations around the world. The stunt work, the effects work, it all adds up. And that's before you even get to marketing costs. And the math just isn't mathing, as the kids So it's been on a little bit of a freeze for that.</p>
</details>

此外，范·迪塞尔正面临性侵犯的民事诉讼，这方面的报道一直不足。你知道，他否认了所有这些指控。这还没有在法庭上得到检验。我想它将在2026年2月开庭审理。我采访过的人都说，一旦这件事以某种方式解决，我们就会对《速度与激情》的未来有更好的了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also because Vin Diesel is facing a civil lawsuit for sexual assaults, which has been kind of underreported. It was, you know, he has contested all those allegations. It has not been tested in court. It will go to courts in February of 2026, I imagine. And the people that I have talked with have, have said this, that once that is resolved, one way or the other, we will have a better idea of what the future of "The Fast and the Furious" is.</p>
</details>

TVO Today: 不过，从创意角度来看，这个系列是否已经“油尽灯枯”了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Creatively, though, has the franchise run out of gas?</p>
</details>

Barry Hertz: 我想你可能在每部电影上映后都用过这个论点。比如：“好吧，我们已经达到了顶峰，无路可走了。”然而，他们似乎总能找到一种方式来让你感到惊喜。所以我认为未来的方向，以及环球影业内部的看法似乎也是如此，就是我们不能再做得更大了。我们已经做到了极致。我们已经去过外太空了。我们不一定会引入一些奇幻元素，比如时间旅行。也许吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think you could probably have used that argument after each one of the films has come out. Like, okay, we've kind of hit the peak here. There's nowhere to go. And yet they always kind of seem to find a way to surprise you. So I think the way to go and the sentiment inside Universal seems to be this way as well, is we can't really go bigger. We've gone as big as we possibly can. We've gone to outer space. We're not going to necessarily introduce some fantastical element like time travel. Maybe.</p>
</details>

所以我们必须稍微回归街头，多做一些艰苦奋斗，多一些 gritty（坚韧不拔的）风格。我不认为它在创意上已经枯竭。我认为它至少在目前会一直找到让我们惊喜的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we got to take it back to the streets a little bit, do a little bit more hard scrabble, a little bit more grit. I do not think that creatively it's exhausted itself. I think it will always, at least for the time being, find ways to surprise us.</p>
