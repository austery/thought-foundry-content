title: 年度最差逆转：加密市场“软件故障”如何引发美股闪崩？
---

### 年度最惨烈的市场逆转
好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘节目。我们有很多内容要讨论。这是过去一年里，我们在全球资本股票市场见过的最糟糕的日子之一，或者说，是最糟糕的逆转之一。标普500指数下跌了1.39%。而在早上，标普500指数还上涨了2%。所以，你看到的是接近3.5%的日内逆转。我的意思是，这太难看了，非常非常难看。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Alright. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We got a lot to talk about. We got a lot to go through. It is one of the ugliest days, rather I should say ugliest reversals that we've seen in the global capital equity markets in the past year. S&P 500 is down 1.39%. In the morning, we were up 2% on the S&P 500. So, you're talking about almost a three and a half% intraday reversal. And I mean, it's ugly. It is very, very ugly.</p>
</details>

Chris 大约20分钟后会加入，他会分享他对宏观经济形势的看法。关于我们为何承受如此大的痛苦，有各种各样的人提出了很多理论。特斯拉股价跌破400美元，下跌1%。英伟达在发布史上最好的财报之一后，下跌3%。Robin Hood 距离跌破100美元仅差5美元，下跌10%。Palantir 跌破160、155，收于154.61，下跌了6.5%。Cipher 早上曾上涨18%，现在下跌2%。Rocket Lab 跌破40美元，下跌10%。Oklo 下跌13%。对于以太坊和加密货币来说，Bitmine 的日子绝对是灾难性的，下跌了10%。Nebia 下跌10%。就连谷歌也下跌了2%。Big Bear AI 下跌4%。博通下跌2.5%。微软现在跌至470美元区间。Meta 跌至580美元。亚马逊在217美元。Mercado Libre 非常接近四月份解放日的低点。比特币86,000美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'll have Chris joining in about 20 minutes. He'll give his thoughts on what's going on in the macro. You have a lot of theories going around from a variety of different people on why we are getting this much pain. But Tesla losing 400 down 1%. Nvidia after one of the best earnings in history down 3%. Robin Hood $5 away from losing 100 down 10%. Palantir lost 160, lost 155, 154.61. That's down six and a half%. Cipher, which was up 18% this morning, is down 2%. Rocket Lab loses 40. I haven't looked at Rocket Lab in a little bit. Just lost 40. That's down 10%. Oaklo down 13%. Bit mine absolutely disgusting day for Ethereum and crypto that's down 10%. Nebia is down 10%. Google even down 2%. Big Bear AI down 4%. Broadcom down 2.5. Microsoft now in the 470s down to Meta at 580. Amazon at 217. Micardo Libre very close to those liberation day lows from April. Bitcoin 86,000.</p>
</details>

### 探究崩盘原因：是“软件故障”还是宏观逆风？
这真是糟糕的一天。对于为什么会这么糟糕，我有一些理论。但说到底，这些理论不一定都说得通。我认为，从今天早上的高点开始的这次“釜底抽薪”——如果你想这么称呼它的话——其速度和幅度都相当惊人。我们经历过震荡，经历过抛售，经历过上涨1%然后下跌0.5%的情况。但我们从未见过在英伟达发布爆炸性财报后市场上涨2%，然后几乎是系统性地完全逆转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it's just an ugly day. It is just an ugly day. I have some theories on why I think it is this ugly. At the end of the day, none of these theories necessarily have to make sense. I think the velocity and magnitude of the rugpull, if that's even what you want to call it, from the highs this morning, it's quite incredible. I don't think we've witnessed the choppiness, we witnessed the selling, we've witnessed up 1%, then down half a percent. we have not witnessed up 2% after a bombastic quarter by Nvidia which essentially controlled the entire market and then almost systematically a complete reversal.</p>
</details>

在逆转过程中出现的几次小反弹，显然都没有撑住。现在，市场的恐惧与贪婪指数距离回到四月份的低点只有几分之遥。感觉上确实应该有一个底部正在形成，但话又说回来，通常正是在这种时候，底部才会失守。今天一整天，我们都看到了这个底部的失守。各种不同的说法来回交织，让人们真正质疑今天到底发生了什么。这就引出了一个问题：到底发生了什么？我有一些理论，但让我们听听 Tom Lee 的看法。这是他对加密货币市场正在发生的事情以及它如何影响今天股票市场的观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and any little bounce you had on that reversal which there were a couple obviously did not hold through and you know you got extreme fear and greed it's a couple points away from going back down to those April lows it really does feel like there should be a bottom that is forming too but then again That's usually when the bottoms fall out. And obviously this morning throughout the entire day, we've seen this bottom fall out. And you've got a lot of different narratives going back and forth making people really question what happened today. Which begs the question, what actually happened? I have some theories, but let's hear from Tom Lee. Here's his perspective on what's going on in the crypto markets and how that's affecting the equity markets today.</p>
</details>

**Tom Lee:** 我想补充一下 Steve 的观点。我认为自10月10日以来，加密市场一直步履维艰，因为那天发生了一次负面冲击。今天股市的走势很像10月10日事件的回响。但在10月10日，那次清算规模如此之大，Brian，它确实重创了做市商。而现在，做市商在加密领域至关重要，因为他们提供流动性。我的意思是，他们几乎扮演着加密领域中央银行的角色。如果他们的资产负债表上出现了需要筹集资本来弥补的漏洞，他们就需要反射性地缩减资产负债表，减少交易。如果价格下跌，他们就必须进行更多的抛售。所以我认为，过去几周加密领域持续的下跌反映了做市商受到的重创。在2022年，这种情况花了八周时间才真正被清理干净。而我们现在才刚刚进入第六周。所以我同意，我认为加密货币、比特币和以太坊在某些方面是股市的领先指标，因为那次平仓以及现在这种步履维艰和流动性减弱的状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh well, I think I'm I'm gonna kind of add to what Steve said. You know, I think the crypto market has been limping along since October 10th because on that date was a negative shock. I mean, today's stock market looks a lot like an echo of what happened October 10th. But on October 10th, that liquidation was so big, Brian, it really crippled market makers. And now market makers are critical in crypto because they provide liquidity. I mean, they act almost as the central bank in crypto. And if they've got a hole in their balance sheet that they need to raise capital for, they need to reflexively reduce their balance sheet, reduce trading. Um, and if prices fall, they've got to then do more selling. So, I think that this drip that's been taking place for the last few weeks in crypto reflects this market maker crippling. And so, in 2022, it took eight weeks uh for that to really get flushed out. We're only 6 weeks into it. So, I kind of concur. I think crypto, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are in some ways a leading indicator for equities because of that unwind and now this sort of limping and and weakened liquidity.</p>
</details>

**Brian Sullivan:** 这也正是我非常聪明的团队为节目开头准备的观点，即比特币今天在股市之前就已经转向下跌了。好的，让我们回到过去。所以10月6日，我想是10月6日或7日，比特币达到了125,000美元。是的。几天后，它仍然在120,000美元左右。现在，显然，比特币在86,000美元左右。那么，在10月10日或其前后具体发生了什么，导致我们现在11月20日处于这个境地？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, that and that was that was the point that my my very very smart team behind me, we put together for the top of the show, which was showing that that Bitcoin turned down today before the market did. All right, take us back. So October 6th, I think it was October 6th or 7th, Bitcoin hit 125,000. Yeah. A couple days later, it was still around 120,000. Now, obviously, Bitcoin's at 86 and change. So, what specifically occurred on or around October 10th that would lead us to where we are now on what, November 20th?</p>
</details>

**Tom Lee:** 是的。嗯，Steve 实际上指出了这一点。在加密领域有很多所谓的自动化流程。其中之一叫做 **ADL**（Automatic Deleveraging：一种自动清算功能，当某人账户或其抵押品价格下跌时会触发）。这本质上就像一个追加保证金通知。在某个特定的交易所，一种稳定币的价格与其他交易所出现了偏差。稳定币本应保持在1美元，但它跌到了65美分。但这只发生在该交易所内部的报价中，原因是流动性问题。这触发了许多账户的 ADL，即自动清算。当这个情况蔓延到其他交易所时，因为它导致清算级联发生，将近两百万个加密账户被清空，尽管在几分钟前它们还是盈利的账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, Steve actually pointed this out. There's a lot of what they call automated processes in crypto. One of them is called ADLK and that's an automatic liquidation feature that would take place if someone's account or their collateral drops in price. It's essentially like a margin call. Um on a specific exchange, a stable coin's price varied from other exchanges. It actually stable coin should stay at a dollar. It dropped to 65 cents. But that only happened within the exchange quotes within this exchange because of liquidity. That triggered an ADL, an automatic liquidation across many accounts. It wiped out as that spread across other exchanges, right? Because liquidations cascade, almost two million crypto accounts got wiped out even though minutes before they were actually profitable accounts.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** Tom Lee 基本上是在指责一个做市商内部的软件故障，认为这是我们看到加密市场出现异常水平去杠杆化的原因，而这也是他认为股票市场同样受到冲击的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> essentially Tom Lee is blaming a software glitch inside of a market maker for why we're seeing the uh exceptional levels of crypto deleveraging which is his thesis for why the equity markets are also being hit as well.</p>
</details>

**Tom Lee:** 嗯，Brian，我知道一些名字，但因为我不想点名，我认为你应该记住的是，这个错误本质上是一个 bug，一个代码错误。因为回想起来，他们本应该从多个交易所获取价格来为那个稳定币定价，而不是依赖内部报价。但这导致了很多做市商和交易员的资本减少。而且你知道，随着交易量下降，加密货币价格走低，他们需要更多的可用资本，这意味着他们要进一步收缩资产负债表。所以这就是那种反射性的削弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, Brian, I'm I I am aware of names, but because uh you know, I'm not someone who wants to name names, uh I think what you should keep in mind is that the this error is actually essentially a bug, you know, a code error because they I think in retrospect they would have pulled pricing from across exchanges to set the price for that stable coin rather than rely on internal quotes. Um so but this has resulted in a lot of market makers and traders having less capital and as you know as crypto prices drift lower because trading volumes drop they need to then have more capital available which means they shrink their balance sheet further. So this is then that reflexive okay weakening.</p>
</details>

### “故障”一词的争议与历史回响
**Brian Sullivan:** Tom，我讨厌“故障”这个词。我无法忍受“故障”这个词，因为你知道，机场里出了问题，他们会说，“一个故障导致你的航班无法起飞。”那不是一个故障，那比故障严重得多。这个词被用来描述相当严重的自动化问题、软件问题、崩溃，但他们试图用它来轻描淡写。这是某种软件 bug 导致了部分问题吗？我正试图完全理解你所暗示的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I hate let me go I want to go back to this point Tom. I hate the term glitch. I can't stand the term glitch because you know things go down at the airport and they say, "Well, a glitch cause your flight to not take off." That's that's not a glitch. That's more than a glitch. It's a word that is used to describe pretty serious automation issues, software problems, crashes for some reason that they try to minimize. Is this some kind of a a software bug that's causing part of this? I'm trying to follow exactly what you're hinting around about.</p>
</details>

**Tom Lee:** 是的，Brian，确实是。比如在1987年，投资组合保险就是所谓的“故障”，它触发了1987年的连锁反应。行业吸取了教训，再也没有提供那种产品。在2009年，问题在于房地产和那些打包的次级抵押贷款中的抵押品不安全。现在行业吸取了教训，他们重新编写了代码。我说的是华尔街。但随后监管机构介入并过度监管。那是那件事的负面影响。在加密领域，ADL 的代码以及他们获取价格的方式，这种事再也不会发生了。好消息是，我们不会在加密领域有过度监管。但现在我们必须处理那种清算效应。2022年是一次大规模清算，花了八周时间。但你说得对，这就是 **DeFi**（Decentralized Finance: 基于区块链的去中心化金融服务）的本质，代码总会存在，错误也总会被发现。你还说过，杠杆是危险的，所以投资者不应该在加密领域使用过度杠杆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh yeah, I mean Brian it is. I mean uh for instance in 1987 portfolio insurance was the quote glitch and that triggered the cascade in 1987 and so the industry learned uh and then never offered that again. You know in 2009 it was really that the collateral wasn't secure in real estate in these package subprime mortgages. Now the industry learned and they recoded that. I'm talking about Wall Street. But then regulators came in and like overregulated. That's that was the negative effect of that. In crypto, this code of ADL and the way they pull prices never going to happen again. The good news is we're not going to have overregulation in crypto. But but now we have to deal with that liquidation effect. 2022 was a big liquidation and it took eight weeks. Um but it it that is not kind of you're right it is the nature of DeFi where there is going to be code and there's going to be an error found and you said it leverage is what's dangerous and so investors should not be using excess leverage in crypto.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这就是 Tom Lee 先生的分析，解释了为什么股票市场受到冲击，从加密市场那里受到了痛苦的连锁影响，而加密市场本身则是因为一个“故障”而受挫。现在，我对于一个“故障”是否足以解释我们所见的痛苦，并不像 Tom Lee 先生那样了解。我认为有很多其他人会说这与故障无关，只是因为加密货币已经见顶。但那是他的论点，他用了1987年的历史论据，他说的没错，确实存在过其他一些特定的故障。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that is Mr. Tom analysis right here on why uh the equity markets are getting hit. are getting a painful residual impact from the crypto markets and the crypto markets are getting hit because of a glitch. Now, I am not as educated on Mr. Tom Lee on if a glitch is enough to explain the pain that we've seen. I think there's a lot of other people that will say it has nothing to do with the glitch. It just has to do with the fact that crypto has topped. Um, but that's his argument and he's using a historical argument from 1987 where that he's not wrong about around how there have been other certain glitches that have existed.</p>
</details>

如果他是对的，这只是个故障，仅此而已。那么理论上，我们应该会看到很快就会触底，去杠杆化会结束，然后事情会向前发展。也许这真的会发生，但我不确定是否很多人真的认为这是正在发生的事情的原因。因此，你看到了一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If he is correct that it's just the glitch and that's it. I mean theoretically we would imagine there would be a bottom soon and that deleveraging would be done and then things would kind of move forward and and maybe that is what happens but I'm not sure if a lot of people actually think that that is the reason for what's going on right here. And so as a result you're seeing some pain.</p>
</details>

他在那次采访中进一步表示，MicroStrategy 等公司之所以受到如此严重的打击，其中一个原因——他希望人们密切关注 MicroStrategy——是，一旦这个故障发生，所有这些做市商现在都需要对冲他们的头寸，因为他们刚刚摆脱了杠杆。他们不能再通过这些专业的期货合约来利用杠杆做空比特币或以太坊。所以，他们正在寻找流动的期权市场。世界上流动性最强的期权市场之一就是 MicroStrategy。而 MicroStrategy 与什么相关？比特币。所以，MSTR 和可能还有 Bitmine 受挫的原因——他没有提到 Bitmine，但我猜想有大量的做市商在说，“嘿，我们干脆做空 BMR，以此来获得对以太坊下行的对冲敞口。” 这也可能正在发生，这就是为什么 Bitmine 和 MicroStrategy 受到的打击如此之大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">goes on further in that interview to say that one of the reasons that Micro Strategy, for example, is getting hit as bad and he wants people to, you know, uh, watch Micro Strategy very well is um that once this glitch has occurred and you have all these market makers that now need to hedge their positions because they just got out of leverage, they can't kind of use leverage to go short Bitcoin or short Ethereum again through these professional futures contracts. So, they're looking to liquid options markets. One of the most liquid option markets in the world is Micro Strategy. And what is Micro Strategy correlated with Bitcoin? So the reason MSTR is and probably Bitmine, I mean he didn't mention Bitmine, but I would imagine you have tons of market makers saying, "Hey, let's just go short BMR as a way to get some hedge exposure to the downside of Ethereum." That also could be taking place, which is why Bitmine and Micro Shai are getting hit as bad as they are.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达悖论与宏观逆风
所以，如果你不愿意相信这个“故障”的解释，那也没关系，还有什么其他的解释呢？我们来看看一些不同的理论。看看这张图。英伟达在发布财报后的头12小时内市值增加了4500亿美元，然后在接下来的12小时内又损失了4500亿美元。我从未见过这样的事情。这绝对是疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But quite frankly, I mean, if you don't want to believe the glitch explanation, which is fine, what other explanation is there? And we'll go through some different theories. take a look at this chart right here. Nvidia gains 450 billion in the first 12 hours since their earnings and then they lose 450 billion in the next 12 hours. I mean, this is just like I have never seen something like this before. I mean this is absolutely insanity.</p>
</details>

这种走势的疯狂程度让你相信，也许正在发生一些更具算法性、更程序化的事情。也许是**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 一种借入低利率日元投资于高收益资产的策略），也许是去杠杆化，也许是系统性抛售，也许真的是一个故障。但这感觉不理性：在英伟达公布那些财报后，每个人都觉得“是的，让我们买入英伟达，英伟达要上月球了”，然后12小时后，每个人都说，“不，我们认为英伟达是个骗局。财报不好。他们没有真正兑现承诺，我们要抛售标普500中最重要的公司，英伟达”，然后当天股价下跌了3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the the the craziness of how this move has taken place makes you believe well maybe there is something going on that is more algorithmic more uh programmatic and and maybe you know maybe that's Japanese yen carry trade maybe that's deleveraging maybe that's systemic selling maybe it is a glitch but it doesn't feel rational that after Nvidia gave those earnings everyone was like yep let's buy Nvidia Nvidia's the moon or it's going to the moon it's probably the moon as well um there's no issue with this AI bubble yada yada And then 12 hours later, everyone's like, "No, we think Nvidia is a scam. The earnings aren't good. They didn't really deliver and we're going to sell off the most important company in the S&P 500, Nvidia, and now down 3% on the day."</p>
</details>

是的，今天有很多关于循环融资和人们审视他们会计的理论。我认为这些是合理的担忧。只是我们真的认为4500亿美元的市值会因为“哦，英伟达的会计似乎有问题”而决定转向吗？考虑到英伟达的会计在过去10个季度里都是一样的。所以，也许人们发现了一些微小的差异，但不足以导致市值如此大的完全逆转，并影响到市场上的每一只其他股票。这对我来说更像是日元套利交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yes, there have been a lot of theories today about circular financing and people looking at their accounting and all that stuff. And I think those are valid concerns to have and those are reasonable concerns. It's just do we really think $450 billion in market cap decided that oh the accounting for Nvidia seems off given the accounting for Nvidia has been the same accounting for the past 10 quarters. So like maybe there's some minute differences people are finding but not enough to the point where you would have that entire reversal of a market cap move which then affects every other stock in the market feels more like a yen carry trade to me.</p>
</details>

这感觉更像是宏观层面发生的事情。显然，我知道人们可能听腻了我这么说，但我们现在正处于降息灾难中。今天早上有两位美联储主席出来说，“我们不需要降息。”然后 Goolsby，他虽然在下次会议上没有投票权，但他是美联储中比较重要的成员之一。他一小时前出来说，2%的通胀目标是神圣的。他说，“我们承诺将通胀维持在2%，所以我们不能违背那个承诺。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean we'll talk about a variety of different theories but it feels more like something that is happening in the macro. Obviously, you know, I know people are probably getting tired of me saying this, but the rate cut disaster that we are in right now. You had two Fed presidents come out this morning and basically say, "We don't need a cut." And then you had Goulsby, by the way, who doesn't have a vote on the next meeting, but Goulby is one of the more important members of the Fed. He came out an hour ago and says the the 2% inflation target is sacred. It was like, we made a promise to keep inflation at 2%, so we can't violate that promise.</p>
</details>

今天早上我们听到的每一次美联储讲话，都植根于我们不会降息这个想法。因此，我认为这就是市场做出如此反应的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But every single Fed talk that we got this morning was rooted in this idea that we're not getting a rate cut. Um, and as a result, I think that's why the Fed is, you know, or that's why the market is reacting the way that the market's reacting.</p>
</details>

所以，如果非要我给出一个原因，我认为是缺乏降息，以及从做市商角度、期权到期角度发生的系统性事件。明天有很多期权到期。或者就是 Tom Lee 谈到的这种程序性故障。但这感觉更根植于宏观因素的组合，无论是日元套利交易、程序性故障，还是显然正在上演的12月不降息的情景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I wish I had better reasons. if I had to give one reason for you guys, I think it would be the lack of a rate cut and then something systemic happening from a market maker perspective, from a option expir perspective, you have a lot of options expiring tomorrow. Um or from this programmatic glitch that Tom Lee is talking about, that could be the reason. But it feels more rooted in a combination of macro, whether that's yen carry trade, uh, programmatic glitches, and then obviously the rate cut, uh, scenario that seems like it's playing out for December, which would entail not getting a rate cut.</p>

JP摩根顺便取消了他们对12月降息的预测。他们仍然相信标普500指数年底会有不错的表现，但他们说，根据今天早上我们得到的就业数据，他们不认为美联储会降息。因此，美联储降息的概率，虽然昨天在27%已经较低，现在是39.6%，比早上的42%有所下降。再次低于50%这个水平，显然这就是我们看到股市如此痛苦的原因之一。

<p class="english-text">JP Morgan, by the way, took away their rate cut forecast for December. Uh they still believe the S&P 500 can have a good end of year, but they said that we don't think the Fed's going to cut rates based on the jobs data we got this morning. And as a result, the Fed probabilities which although they were lower yesterday at 27%, they're now at 39.6%. They're down from 42% in the morning. So once again below this 50% level and obviously that's why we're seeing a lot of or that is one of the reasons potentially we could be seeing a lot of pain in the equity markets.</p>

### Chris Patel 的深度解析
**Amit Kukreja:** 让我们听听其他人的看法。女士们先生们，Chris Patel 先生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get some other perspectives onto the show and see what some people are thinking. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Chris Patel.</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 当你涉足加密货币时，它是一个具有很大广度的资产类别，但它也有很大的波动性。所以，当你持有这些波动性资产时，你必须记住，嘿，这就是你所选择的。风险缓解应该是每个投资者都应该考虑的事情，尤其是在加密货币方面，因为加密货币的基本面基本上是建立在下一个人愿意支付的价格之上的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, when you sign up, when you get into crypto, it's an asset class that has a lot of breath, but it also has a lot of volatility. So, um, whenever you have these volatile assets, you just have to remember that, hey, this is what you're signing up for, right? So, risk mitigation is supposed to be on every investor's mind, especially when it comes to crypto, because the the underlying fundamentals of crypto are basically built on what the next person is willing to pay for the most part.</p>
</details>

我认为我们必须从10月10日开始说起。一旦你了解了10月10日发生了什么，你就能明白我们现在经历的很多事情在某种程度上是有道理的。10月10日是加密货币有史以来最大的清算事件之一。很多人，特别是在投机方面，他们冲进去，用大量杠杆购买了大量的以太坊和比特币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think we have to kind of start off at October 10th, right? Once you once you get an understanding of what happened on October 10th, you can kind of see how a lot of this stuff makes somewhat sense what we're going through right now. So, October 10th was one of the largest liquidation events for crypto ever. A lot of people what they did is especially this on the speculative side, they rushed in and they bought a lot of Ethereum, a lot of uh Bitcoin and they did it with a lot of leverage.</p>
</details>

特别是通过这些**永续期货合约**（Perpetual Futures Contracts: 一种没有到期日的金融衍生品，允许交易者进行高杠杆交易），他们可以获得高达250倍的杠杆。10月10日，我们收到了唐纳德·特朗普那条臭名昭著的推文，说要对中国征收100%的关税。当他这样做时，市场开始下跌。那天因为那次大幅下跌，很多人被追加了保证金。经纪人保护自己的方式是，当你达到亏损限额时，他们会自动开始抛售。问题是，如果他们都在同一时间开始抛售，就会导致像洪水一样的人群涌向出口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">especially with these perpetual futures contracts which allows them to go up to 250x leverage. October 10th we get that infamous tweet from Donald Trump saying we're going to send China you know we're going to tariff China 100%. And when he did that, it sort of triggered um markets to go down. that day because of that massive dip, a lot of people got margin called. And the way that the the brokers, they kind of protect themselves is that when you go, you know, when you lose when you hit your limits, they start automatically selling. The problem is if they all start selling at the same exact time, it causes like this giant flood of people going through out the exit door.</p>
</details>

问题在于，一旦你这样做了，你基本上就从那个特定的资产类别中抽走了巨大的流动性池。要恢复信心需要时间。关键在于，时间最终会解决这个问题，因为看好以太坊的理由是，未来几周确实会有一些用例催化剂出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is once you do that, you you're basically taking away this giant pool of liquidity from that specific asset class. And to get confidence back, it takes time. So the key here is time will eventually fix this because the the reason to be bullish especially on Ethereum is that there actually are some use case catalysts that are coming up in the next few weeks.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 让我们转向股票市场，谈谈你是如何看待的。英伟达，有史以来最好的季度。一切都是绿色的，包括加密货币。然后在大约上午11点，一切都崩盘了。你混迹市场比我久。你的直觉反应是什么？你认为今天的抛售还有更多深层原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's transition to the equity markets and kind of how you're thinking of it. Nvidia, best quarter ever. Uh, everything's green, including crypto. And then at around 11 a.m., it all dumps. I mean, you've been around markets longer than me. What do you think your gut reaction is that happened? And do you think there's a lot more to the sell-off that we saw today?</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 我认为人们有时需要退后一步，问问自己市场的普遍情绪是什么。我认为英伟达，即使他们公布了这些数据，最初的反应是“天哪，人工智能需求巨大”，但这个领域仍然存在很多恐惧，特别是看到**超大规模数据中心**（Hyperscalers: 指的是像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样运营着巨大规模数据中心的公司）为了支持这种建设所做的融资交易。因为他们经历过多次这样的泡沫，他们称之为泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I think people have to I think take a step back sometimes and just say to themselves like what is the market sentiment, right? I think Nvidia even though when they came out with these numbers the initial reaction was holy crap like there's tons of AI demand. There still is a lot of uh fear out there when it comes to this sector and seeing some of the financing deals that you know the hyperscalers are doing in order to support this buildout. because they've lived through multiple um multiple bubbles like this they've called it a bubble.</p>
</details>

我认为我们今天看到的是，有报告指出，今天早上有大量散户和追涨的人涌入英伟达，这些股票的流动性非常大。交易量绝对是惊人的。所以当散户和很多追涨的人涌入英伟达时，很多机构正在抛售。这就是为什么你在英伟达看到了这种巨大的逆转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think what we saw today, and this is something that I saw in the reports, which was um there was a lot of liquidity in these names with a lot of people FOMOing into Nvidia this morning. volume was absolutely insane. So while retail and a lot of FOMO like people who were FOMOing into the to to Nvidia, a lot of institutions were selling out. You know, so that's why you saw this absolute giant reversal in Nvidia.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 你认为昨晚的财报能证明这种抛售是合理的吗？还是你认为除了获利了结之外，还有其他原因？比如，你是否在考虑日元套利交易、降息等宏观因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, do you think the earnings from last night justify this type of sell-off or do you think there was something else to the sell-off besides the profit taking? Like, are you thinking yen carry trade, rate cuts? Is there anything else in the macro that you think is leading to the sell-off?</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 从宏观方面来看，我认为我们对降息幅度的预期与实际情况之间肯定发生了巨大的重新评估。自从鲍威尔上次会议出来说，“看，我们……基本上鲍威尔有点坑了我们，他说，‘嘿，听着各位，12月不保证会降息’”，市场情绪就一直在变。现在我们还面临着这个没有数据的“静默期”。所以美联储只是谨慎地说，“看，在没有合法数据证明需要再次降息的情况下，我们最好还是等等看。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, from a macro side, I think that there has definitely been a giant rerating of the level of rate cuts that we were we were thinking that we were going to get versus what we're actually going to get. I mean, sentiment's been flipping since Pal came out. I think the last uh meeting and said, "Look, we're we're I think the Mar basically Pal kind of screwed us a little bit and saying, "Hey, listen guys, December, there's no guarantee that December is going to have a rate cut and then all of us, you know, and then now we're also dealing with this blackout period where we don't have any data. So the Fed is just being cautious and saying, "Look, in the absence of legitimate data that can prove out the need for another cut, it's better that we just kind of wait it out."</p>
</details>

### 2026年市场展望与投资组合策略
**Amit Kukreja:** 摩根士丹利预测到2026年底标普500指数将达到7800点。你认为如果劳动力市场崩溃，通胀不放缓，人工智能交易变得不稳定，2026年还有可能成为牛市吗？还是你认为会是平淡的一年？或者会重演2022年的情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, Morgan Stanley says 7,800 by the end of 2026. Do you think 2026 has a shot of being a bull market if the labor market collapses, if inflation doesn't slow down, like if the AI trade gets wobbly, or do you think it's a flat year? Do you think it ends up being a 2022 repeat?</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 我认为会有一个点，市场再次变得超卖，我们会看到市场出现10%以上的修正。但我认为这些是加仓的机会，而不是试图卖出并预测顶部。我告诉你其中一个原因，因为你实际上正在进入一个降息周期。从商业角度来看，很多公司的利润率与他们能借多少钱以及以什么利率借钱直接相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think there's going to be a point where things get oversold again and we see like uh we see like a 10% plus correction in the markets. But I think those are like opportunities to keep to add rather than trying to sell things off and try to call a top. And I'll tell you one of the reasons why is because you're literally going into a rate cutting cycle, right? From a business standpoint, a lot of companies, you know, their profit margins are directly linked to how much money they can borrow, like how much money they can borrow and at what rate.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 考虑到过去几周发生的一切，为明年构建一个投资组合，你会选择哪五只股票？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's do this. So, given everything that has happened over the past couple of weeks, and obviously opinions can change in the coming weeks, uh five stocks to construct a portfolio for next year, whether you own them or you don't own them.</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 我会说谷歌肯定是其中之一。你肯定想持有 Meta 的敞口。我实际上看好挪威邮轮公司（NCL）。还有 Verizon。至于第五个，把礼来（Eli Lilly）加进去吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I'd say Google is definitely one of them. You definitely want to have Meta exposure. I'm actually bullish on Norwegian Cruise Lines, NCL. Verizon, would you put that up there? No, no, no, no. Put Novo Nordisk on there for me if I if I had to say. you know what? Take Novo out. Put Eli Liy on there for me. Sorry.</p>
</details>

### 尾声：在不确定性中坚守信念
**Amit Kukreja:** 你有什么建议给那些正在努力应对这样回调的人们吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">emotionally, do you have any advice? You are a bit older. You've been through these cycles for people trying to navigate a draw down like this.</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 使用彼得·林奇的模型。找到那些你知道五年后你仍会使用的公司、股票。如果你认为你投资的股票五年后你不会再使用，或者它在五年后表现不佳，无论其他财务数据如何，那就不要持有它。将你的投资视野扩大到五年后。从那里开始。不要考虑今天什么被高估了，明天什么被高估了，想想五年后。就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Peter Lynch, use the Peter Lynch model. Find the companies, the stocks, whatever that you know five years from now you're going to be using. So if you think that you know what, you're invested in a stock that you're not going to be using in five years or it's not going to do well in five years regardless of what other financials are, then don't be in it. I would say expand your investment horizon to five years from now. Go from there, you know, and and don't think about, okay, what's overvalued today, what's overvalued tomorrow, like think about five years from now. That's it.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 你的建议本质上是，如果你对自己持有的股票有非常强的信念，如果你真正相信它们，那么处理回调就真的很容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Essentially your advice is it is really easy to handle a draw down if you have very strong conviction on the names you hold and if you truly believe in them aka you use their products or you you know just feel very passionately about their products like it's hard to get that afraid when they go in fact you get more excited when they go down right</p>
</details>

**Chris Patel:** 是的，你有时会发现市场过度修正了。就像我说的，你还记得 Meta 吗？Meta 在2022年跌到八九十美元的区间是完全没有道理的，但我们确实到了那里。你可以为此哭泣，说“天哪，不，我亏了这么多钱。”而我会说，“兄弟，对真正的投资者来说，那只是一个增加更多持仓的机会。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you get you get you sometimes the market overcorrects like like I said you remember Meta Meta had no business going into the 8090 range in 2022, but we got there, you know, and that's the thing, like you could cry about it and be like, "Oh my god, no." Like, "I've lost all this money." And I'm like, "Bro, it's to real investors that was just like, oh man, that's an opportunity to add more, you know, as long</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 好的，各位，今天就到这里。这是我们一年中见过的最糟糕的逆转之一，3.5%的幅度，不是单纯的下跌或上涨，而是先涨后跌。这就是为什么看到它完全逆转如此令人痛心。然后就没有底部了，底部失守了。这些股票跌破了它们所有的移动平均线。所以，不幸的是，这是我们必须经历的日子之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, guys. I think that's it. I mean, there's not really much else here today. Hopefully with Chris on he was a little bit consoling. One of the worst reversals we've seen in a year three and a half% not just down or up but up then down. And so that's why it was really so gut-wrenching seeing it completely reverse. And then there was no there was no bottom. The bottom fell out. I mean these names violated every moving average that they have. So, unfortunately, it was one of those days that we just got to live live through.</p>
