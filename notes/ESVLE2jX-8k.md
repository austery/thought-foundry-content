### 第一章：重新思考我们如何学习、成长与改变

我作为临床心理学家的职业生涯始于教导父母如何使用“暂停”（timeouts）、惩罚和奖励。我接受的训练就是如此。在我的私人诊所里，总有这样的时刻：父母们走进来，抱怨说：“我的孩子为了一件可笑的小事大发脾气。”“我的孩子对我撒谎。”“我的孩子顶嘴。”无论问题是什么，我都会说：“好的，我们来学习如何进行‘暂停’。我来教你怎么做，或者怎么用贴纸奖励表。”我这样做了一段时间。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I began my career as a clinical psychologist teaching parents how to give timeouts and punishments and rewards. That's how I was trained. And so, there were all these moments in my private practice. parents would come in, "My kid's having a tantrum about something ridiculous. My kid is lying to me. My kid is talking back." Whatever it was, and I'd say, "Okay, let's learn how to give a timeout. Let me teach you how to give a timeout. Let me teach you how to do a sticker chart." So, I was doing that for a while.</p>
</details>

后来，我有了自己的孩子，也开始反思自己的童年，思考哪些时刻真正帮助了我，哪些则没有。此外，我的私人诊所里也发生了一些有趣的变化。除了接待那些为年幼孩子问题而来的父母，我也为成年人提供个人治疗和夫妻治疗。我对自己与成年人合作的方式感觉很好，那是一种结合了**内在家庭系统**（Internal Family Systems, IFS: 一种心理治疗模型，认为人的内心由多个“部分”组成，旨在促进这些部分和谐共处）、**依恋理论**（Attachment Theory: 由心理学家约翰·鲍比等人提出，认为早期亲子关系质量深刻影响个体一生的情感和社会发展）和躯体疗法（somatic work）的方法。我是一个非常务实的人，所以总会给他们布置一周的“家庭作业”以及许多其他任务。我亲眼见证了成年人如何改变他们的生活。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Then, I had my own kid and I also just started to reflect on my own childhood and what moments really helped me and what moments didn't. Plus, something interesting was happening in my private practice. In my private practice, beyond seeing parents to talk about issues with young kids, I was seeing adults for therapy, for couples therapy. And I felt really good about the way I was working with adults. It was a combination of, you know, internal family systems and attachment theory and sematic work. And I'm just a very practical person. So, I'd always give homework for the week and so many different things. And I watched adults change their lives.</p>
</details>

我知道，当成年人来找我做治疗时，他们会说：“哦，我知道我提过要向老板要求升职，但我就是没做。”或者，“我知道我们正在处理我的愤怒问题，但这周我又发火了。”我绝不会对这些人说：“把你的手机给我。一周不准吃甜点。我希望你离开我的办公室，等你不再发火了再回来。我希望你离开，等你要求升职了再回来。”你能想象那样的治疗师吗？我希望任何客户都会说：“那我再也不会来见你了。为什么增加羞耻和指责能帮助我改善行为？”说真的，你凭什么理论认为这会奏效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I knew is that when adults would come to me for therapy and say things like, "Oh, I know I talked about asking my boss for a promotion, but I just didn't do it." Or, "I know we're working on my anger, but I yelled this week." I would never say to those people, "Give me your phone. No dessert for a week. I want you to leave my office and come back when you don't yell. I want you to leave my office and come back when you ask for that promotion." I mean, can you imagine the therapist? I I would hope any client would say, "Well, I'm never coming back to see you again. Why would adding shame and blame help me improve my behavior?" Like literally, what's your theory for why that would even work?</p>
</details>

这让我深受触动，因为我时常会先接待一个成年客户，紧接着又接待一个年幼孩子的家长。我开始思考，成年人改变所需的方法，与儿童成长所需的方法，绝不可能完全相悖。然后我意识到，等等，我们实际上是在童年时期制造了所有这些问题，然后试图在成年后修复它们。这是一个极其低效的系统。这并不是说我认为我们可以成为完美的父母，我们不能。我们都会在某些事情上挣扎。我希望我的孩子们将来会去接受心理治疗，谈论他们生活中的事情。但我们不必用惩罚和严厉的方式对待孩子。如果我们这样做了，又怎能期望他们在成年后真正茁壮成长呢？我们成年后，实际上正努力摆脱所有那些源于童年的自我批评和自责，以便最终能获得多一点的踏实感和洞察力，从而真正做出我们想要在生活中实现的有益改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it just struck me cuz I'd have these sessions where I was seeing adult adult and then parent of a young kid. And I just started thinking there is no way that what adults need to change could be at complete odds with what children need to grow. And then I realized, wait, I actually think we're like causing all of these problems in childhood and trying to fix them in adulthood. It's just a remarkably inefficient system, which is not a way of saying I think we can be perfect parents. We cannot. And we're all going to struggle with things. And I hope my kids go to therapy to talk about things in their life. But we don't have to approach our kids with punishment and harshness. And if we do, why would we expect them to actually thrive in adulthood? We're actually trying to unwire all of that self-criticism and self-lame that we have as adults from our childhood so we can finally have a little bit more groundedness and perspective to actually make the productive changes we want in our life.</p>
</details>

好的。所以，当时在我的私人诊所里，我正处于这样一个时刻。我接待着父母们，说实话，我当时还在某种程度上忽略内心的那种感觉，只是说：“好吧，这是做‘暂停’的方法。这是做贴纸奖励表的方法。”直到有一天，我身体里的那种不协调感变得太过强烈，我简直无法集中精神。我面前坐着一对父母，我正在教他们如何进行“暂停”。最后，我脱口而出：“对不起。我现在告诉你们的这些，我其实一点也不相信。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, I was in this moment in my private practice and I was seeing parents and I want to be honest, I was still kind of ignoring that feeling in me like, "Okay, well, here's how to do a timeout. Here's how to do the sticker chart." And one day in my private practice, all I can say is the dissonance, I think, in my body. It just became too loud. I honestly couldn't focus. And I had these parents in front of me and I was teaching them how to do a timeout. And I ended up saying to them, "I'm sorry. I actually don't believe anything I'm telling you right now.</p>
</details>

不出所料，他们看着我，那表情仿佛在说：“我为什么要付钱给你？我现在就要离开你的办公室。”我赶紧说：“等等。我觉得我只需要一点时间。我知道有更好的方法。”我当时实际上在想：“我只想把我所知道的、能帮助成年人重新塑造自我的所有方法，进行逆向工程，直接教给父母，让他们从小就用在孩子身上。”但我当时还不确切知道该怎么做。我知道我希望这种方法非常具体和实用，因为“暂停”和贴纸奖励表之所以受父母欢迎——也包括我——就是因为它直接告诉你该做什么。我们都希望有人能直接告诉我们该怎么做。但我想：“我们绝对可以升级‘该做什么’，超越贴纸奖励表和‘暂停’。”那对父母基本上是说：“我们还是去找别人谈谈吧。”我说：“我完全理解。非常抱歉。是的，我一定会退还您这次的咨询费。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And not surprisingly, they looked at me and they were like, "Why am I paying you any money? I'm going to leave your office right now." And I was like, "Hold on. I I feel like I just need a little bit of time. I know there's a better better way." And I was actually thinking like, "I just want to take everything that I know helps adults and helps them rewire and reverse engineer it to parents to give to kids right away." But I but I didn't know how exactly yet. And I knew I wanted that approach to be super concrete and practical because the one thing about timeouts and sticker charts that I think parents love and me too is that it just tells you what to do. We're like, "Well, just tell me what to do. We need something to do." But I was like, "We can definitely upgrade what to do from a sticker chart and a timeout." And you know, these parents essentially my office were like, "We're just going to go find someone else to talk to." And I was like, "I totally get it. I'm so sorry. And yes, I will definitely refund you for the session."</p>
</details>

### 从“暂停”与奖励到“内在良善”

从那时起，新想法如潮水般涌现。似乎一旦我终于说出了心里话，我就有了开放的心态去记录下无数的想法。我想，这一切始于剥离那些我们都习以为常的假设。比如，“如果你不惩罚坏行为，你基本上就是在强化它。”这真的对吗？我和我丈夫之间也有过一些我不引以为豪的时刻，他并没有惩罚我，但我并不认为他是在强化我的坏行为。如果他对我说：“贝姬，你要是再对我大吼大叫，我一周都不跟你一起吃饭了，”我真的不认为这会激励我以积极的方式改变。当然，我也不期望他逆来顺受，但如果他说：“哇，你刚才那样很不对。你可能遇到了什么事，因为你通常不这样。我们一起来弄清楚到底发生了什么。我真的觉得这可能才是你需要的，而且老实说，这也可能真正帮助你改变。我们一起解决吧。”我绝不会想：“哦，我丈夫真让我为所欲为。”这种想法很疯狂，只有当我们对人性持有极其负面的看法时才会产生，而我并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I started this just surge maybe is the word of new ideas. It's like once I finally said this thing, I had the openness to write down so many ideas. And I think what started was just stripping away all the assumptions that we've all accepted as true. If you don't punish bad behavior, you're basically reinforcing that. Is that true? Like I have moments that I'm not proud of with my husband and he doesn't punish me, but I don't think he's reinforcing bad behavior. And if he said to me, "Becky, if you yell at me one more time, I'm not going to eat dinner with you for a week," I I just don't think that would inspire me to change in a positive way. Now, I don't expect him to be kind of a doormat in the other way, but if he said, "Whoa, that was not okay." and there's probably something going on with you because you don't usually act like that. And let's get to the bottom of that. I actually think that's probably what you need. And honestly, it's probably the thing that's also going to help you change. So, let's figure that out together. No part of me would think, "Oh, my husband really lets me walk all over him." It's actually a crazy thought that we would only have if we have an incredibly negative view of humans, which I do not have.</p>
</details>

当我开始质疑这种方法时，我最终得出了两个基本理念。第一，我们生来“内在良善”（good inside）。这绝不是为我们的不良行为开脱。但我们的内心是善良的。了解这一点其实很有帮助，因为它在“善良的身份”和“不良的行为”之间创造了一个区分。这让我们能够去思考：一个好人为什么会做坏事？从这个问题出发，我们才能进行更有效的干预。我意识到的另一件事是，孩子天生拥有所有的情感，却没有任何管理这些情感的技能。而没有技能的情感，总是会以不良行为的形式表现出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when I started to question this approach, I was left with two foundations really. Number one, we are born good inside. That doesn't excuse our bad behaviors at all. But inside, we are born good. And actually, that's really helpful to know because it creates a gap between good identity and bad behaviors. And it allows us to wonder, well, why would a good person do a bad thing? And from that question, we can actually intervene much more effectively. And the other thing I realized is kids are just born with all the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings. And feelings without skills always come out as bad behavior.</p>
</details>

所以，“内在良善”的理念在于，我们可以将行为与身份分离开来。这样做，我们并不会成为纵容的父母，反而会成为有效的领导者，能够教给孩子他们原本不具备的技能。这样一来，他们不仅能改善自己的行为，还能成长为有韧性、成功的成年人。接下来，让我们深入探讨行为与身份的区别，以及如何将这个理念非常具体地应用到管理孩子们的困难行为中——比如发脾气、为小事与兄弟姐妹争吵、当着你的面说“我恨你”或者撒谎，所有这些棘手的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the idea of good inside is that we can separate behavior from identity. And in doing that, we don't become permissive parents. We actually become effective leaders who can teach kids skills they didn't have in the first place. so that not only can they improve their behavior, they can actually grow up and be resilient, successful adults. So, let's jump into this idea about how behavior is different from identity and then very practically how that idea comes to life in managing your kids's difficult behavior. The tantrum, the sibling arguing about something so silly, maybe the I hate you to your face or lying, all those hard situations.</p>
</details>

### 行为与身份：育儿观念的根本转变

作为人类，出于多种原因，我们习惯于看到某人的不良行为，就自以为我们已经了解了关于这个人的全部。有人上班迟到，那个人就是懒惰。我们的孩子打了另一个孩子，他们就是个“打人者”。我们甚至会基于那一刻，推断未来：“哦，他将永远是班里的坏孩子。他永远不会有朋友。”如果你仔细想想这里真正发生了什么，那就是行为与身份的混淆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a habit as humans for many reasons of seeing someone's bad behavior and kind of assuming we know everything we need to know about the person. Someone's late to work, that person is lazy. Our kid hits another kid, they're a hitter, right? And then even we take that moment, we tend to project forward, oh, they're always going to be the bad kid in class. They're never going to have friends. And if you think about what's really happening here is there's a conflation of behavior with identity.</p>
</details>

这种情况发生的原因之一是，行为是可观察的，而身份不是。所以我们的大脑最快的处理方式就是：我们看到行为（打人），就假定身份（坏孩子）。但实际上，情况并非如此。我们认为行为就是身份，两者之间没有空隙。我们倾向于这样做的另一个原因是，我们大多数人成长的家庭环境，就是将我们等同于我们最坏的行为。没有人把我们看作一个“正在经历困难的好孩子”，将身份和行为分开。所以，我们的大脑已经将这两者紧密地连接在了一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the reasons this happens is behavior is observable and identity isn't. So the quickest thing for our mind to do is we see behavior hitting we assume identity bad kid. But actually this isn't what's happening. This is what's happening. Behavior is identity and there's no space in between. The other reason we tend to do this is because most of us grew up in homes where we were seen as our worst behavior. Nobody saw us as a good kid identity who was having a hard time behavior where those things were separate. So we've actually wired those two things together.</p>
</details>

我认为，“内在良善”理念中一个能改变人生的观点就是：将行为与身份分离开来。这在教育孩子、与自己相处、处理婚姻或工作关系中，都同样具有改变人生的力量。很重要的一点是，人们会说：“哦，所以你就是放任你的孩子不管了。他们是‘正在经历困难的好孩子’，所以他们打兄弟姐妹也没关系。”不，完全不是。我从未见过我的孩子打人时说：“哦，把愤怒发泄出来吧。你是个正在发泄愤怒的好孩子。我喜欢这样。”那也太奇怪了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the life-changing ideas I think around good inside is to separate behavior from identity. And this is as life-changing in parenting your kid as it is in relating to yourself as it is in your marriage or your work relationship. And what's really important is people say, "Oh, so you're just letting your kid off the hook. They're a good kid having a hard time, so it's okay that they're hitting a sibling." No, not at all. I've never seen my kid hit another kid and say, "Gh, let out that anger. You're a good kid letting out anger. I love it. That would be so bizarre."</p>
</details>

把我的孩子看作一个“正在经历困难的好孩子”，能让我更像一个教练一样去干预，而不是一个只知道施加惩罚的人。这一点非常重要。因为当你意识到，“等一下，我有一个正在经历困难的好孩子”，在那一刻，我会迅速介入。我甚至可能会说：“哇，我不会让你打你哥哥的。”我会把我的孩子抱起来，带到一边。如果我状态好，我甚至会说：“你是个正在经历困难的好孩子，我会帮你度过难关。”这是孩子们能听到的最具变革性的话语之一。许多父母都说，对孩子说出这句简单的话——“你是个正在经历困难的好孩子”——能以一种他们从未尝试过的任何其他方式都无法比拟的方式，缓和紧张的局势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Seeing my kid as a good kid having a hard time allows me to intervene more like a coach than someone who's just delivering punishment. That's really important. Because when you realize, hold on a second, I have a good kid having a hard time. In the moment, I'm going to swoop in. I might even say, whoa, I'm not going to let you hit your brother. I'm going to pick my kid up and carry them to the side. And I might, if I'm on my game, even say, "You're a good kid having a hard time, and I'm going to help you through it." It's one of the most life-changing things for kids to hear. And so many parents have said that simple phrase, saying to their kid, "You're a good kid having a hard time," has deescalated. a hard situation in a way nothing else they've ever tried has.</p>
</details>

如果你想一想，这很有道理。想想你自己经历困难的时刻，想想别人看你的眼神，仿佛你是个坏人。也许这发生在最近与伴侣或在工作中的争吵中，你就是能感觉到那种眼神，好像在说：“我看到了你的坏行为，我正把你当成一个坏人来对待。”我们会感到羞耻，陷入负面循环，情况变得更糟。在成年后，没有什么比有人对你说这样的话更有力量了：“等一下。你是个好人。你只是说了一些我感觉你并非真心想说的话。让我们花点时间冷静一下。我们可以再试一次。”在我们最艰难的时刻，我们都渴望有人能看到我们内在固有的善良。有时，我们需要别人先看到它，我们自己才能触及它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you think about it, that makes sense. Think about your own hard moment and think about the way people look at you like you're a bad person. Maybe it's happened in a recent argument with a partner or at work and you just get this look like I see your bad behavior and I kind of am treating you like a bad person. We have shame. We spiral. We get worse. There's nothing more powerful in adulthood as someone saying to you some version of, "Hold on a second. You're a good person. You just said something that I have a feeling you didn't really mean. Let's take a moment to cool off. We can try this again." In our hardest moments, we are all desperate to have someone else see the inherent goodness inside of us. And sometimes we need someone else to see it before we can access it ourself.</p>
</details>

以撒谎为例。当我们的孩子对我们撒谎时，这非常容易触发我们的情绪。最近有位家长说：“我有一个Nest摄像头。我看到我十几岁的孩子从我抽屉里偷钱。我问他这件事。”他说：“没有，我没做。”顺便提一句，永远不要问一个你已经知道答案的问题。你实际上只是想当场抓住他们撒谎，这会让任何人都变得防御。但如果我们把这看作一个“正在经历困难的好孩子”，我们就会以完全不同的方式看待它。这并不意味着我要为他偷钱开个派对，完全不是。但我可能会这样说：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's take lying as a situation. Very triggering when our kids lie to us. Recently had a parent say, "I have a Nest camera. I saw my teenager steal money from my drawer. I asked my teenager about it." They said, "Nope, I didn't do it." Separate, but related. Never ask someone a question you know the answer to. You're actually just trying to catch them in a lie, which makes anyone defensive. But if we think about this as a good kid having a hard time, we see it very differently. It doesn't mean I'm going to throw my kid a party for stealing money. Not at all. But I'd probably say something like this.</p>
</details>

“嘿，我看到你从我抽屉里拿钱了。等一下，这并不是要惩罚你。那样的想法太短视了。我知道你是个好孩子。肯定发生了什么事，让你觉得不能来找我要钱，无论你需要它做什么。没错，我最后可能会拒绝。但重要的是，我们之间能有那种你可以来找我的关系。老实说，随着你长大，生活中的事情变得更棘手，这一点可能只会越来越重要。所以，你当时是怎么想的？我只是想真正理解发生了什么，这比行为本身重要得多，因为这是我们能够预见并处理未来一切事情的唯一途径。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, I saw that you took money from my drawer. Hold on a second. This is not about to be a punishment. That would be way too much short-term thinking. I know you're a good kid. And there must have been something going on that you didn't think you could come ask me for money for whatever you wanted it for. And it's true. I might end up saying no. But it's really important that we have the type of relationship where you know you could come to me. Honestly, that's probably only becoming more and more important as you get older and things get even trickier in your life. So, what was going on for you? I just want to actually understanding what was happening is so much more important than the behavior itself because that's the only way we can get ahead of everything that's going to happen after.</p>
</details>

我知道家长们会怎么想。我们传统上认为，这难道不是在纵容不良行为吗？理解不良行为背后的原因，与纵容行为完全不是一回事。我们在任何其他方面都不会这么想。想象一下，一个篮球队里有个非常优秀的球员，但他连续几场比赛表现糟糕。教练说：“等一下。这场比赛我让你下场，但明天我们一起去体育馆。让我们好好研究一下。你的上篮和传球到底出了什么问题？一切都不对劲。我和你是一队的。我想了解发生了什么。”我真的不知道有哪个家长会说：“我不想让我的孩子跟着那个教练。那个教练在纵容坏行为。他基本上是在告诉我的孩子，打得不好也没关系。”这太荒谬了。我们没人会那么想。你知道我们都会怎么想吗？“这才是我想要的教练。”那个教练实际上在努力找到问题的根源，因为那是唯一能真正改善行为的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I know what parents think. We traditionally think, isn't that permitting the bad behavior? Understanding the reasons for a bad behavior is not at all the same thing as permitting behavior. And we don't think about that in any other way. If you think about a kid on a basketball team who's a really good player but has an awful couple games and you think about the coach saying, "Hold on a second. I'm taking you out for this game, but tomorrow let's go to the gym together. Let's really figure this out. What's going on with your layups and your passing? Everything is off. I'm on your team. I want to understand what's happening." I I just don't know one parent who would say, "I don't want that coach for my kid. That coach is permitting bad behavior. That coach is basically telling my kid it's okay to have a bad game." It's bananas. None of us think that. You know what we all think? That's the coach I want. That coach actually is trying to get to the source of what was happening because that's the only way you can actually improve behavior.</p>
</details>

很多人问我关于奖励表、暂停、贴纸的问题。他们觉得这些方法在改善行为方面确实有效。比如，“我为什么要放弃这些方法？”首先，我会质疑这些方法的有效性。而且，很多显示短期效果的研究并没有讲述儿童发展的全貌。任何基于恐惧的方法，有时确实能让孩子在短期内服从。我不认为这是值得夸耀的数据。我们知道的是，童年是孩子学习他们一生所需技能的绝佳时期。我不知道我们中有谁会真的认为“我是通过被惩罚学会技能的”。我猜，你最多只是有了一个“不该做什么”的榜样，但没有人帮助你知道“该做什么”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, a lot of people ask me reward charts, timeouts, stickers. I feel like these have worked to improve behavior. Like, why would I depart from these methods? So, first of all, I'd call into question how effective these methods are. And also, a lot of studies that so show shortterm impact don't tell the whole story of child development. Anything that's fearbased, sometimes you can get kids to short-term comply. I don't think that's data worth bragging about. What we know is that childhood is an amazing time for kids to learn the skills they are going to need for life. I don't know if any of us really think I learned skills by being punished. You do have a model of what not to do, I guess. But nobody's helping you know what to do.</p>
</details>

以嫉妒为例。为什么孩子会打兄弟姐妹？有时他们只是嫉妒。“哦，我哥哥有个我此刻非常想玩的卡车。我嫉妒，我沮丧。我没有管理这些情绪的技能。”所以，它就以打人的形式表现出来。现在我因为打人而被罚“暂停”。这会奏效吗？快进很多很多年。我不认为我20多岁时会因为我哥哥有个我没有的玩具卡车而嫉妒他。但你最好相信，当我看到我哥哥的工作比我的更成功，或者他拥有的房子比我能负担得起的更大时，我会感到非常嫉妒和沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's take jealousy as an example. Why do kids hit siblings? Sometimes they're just jealous. Oh, my sibling has a truck that I really want to play with in this moment. I'm jealous. I'm frustrated. I don't have the skills to manage those feelings. So, it comes out as a hit. Now I get a timeout for not hitting. And is that going to work? Well, fast forward many, many years. I don't think I'm going to be jealous of my sibling in my 20s that they have a toy truck that I don't have. But you better bet that when I see my sibling have a job that feels more successful than my job or own a home that is bigger than the home I can afford, I'm going to feel pretty jealous and frustrated.</p>
</details>

如果我没有管理这些情绪的技能，我不知道它是否会以打人的形式表现出来，但它肯定会以相当有害的行为表现出来。技能不会随着年龄的增长而白白获得。我们不会在18岁时就神奇地能够管理自己的情绪。事情不是这样运作的。我们是通过我们最早的关系来学习如何管理情绪的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if I don't have skills to manage those feelings, I don't know if it would come out as a hit, but it would come out as pretty toxic behavior. Skills aren't gifted to us with age. We don't magically become able to manage our emotions when we become 18. That's not how it works. We learn how to manage our emotions through our earliest relationships.</p>
</details>

我总是告诉父母，孩子们无法学会容忍我们无法在他们身上容忍的情感。所以，如果我的孩子嫉妒和沮丧，并以不良行为表现出来，而我所做的只是把他们送到自己的房间，也许短期内对某些孩子有效——仅限于那些取悦型（people pleasing）的孩子，对于非取悦型的孩子，你惩罚他们，他们只会变本加厉。我的孩子可能会表现出：“哦，我要改变我的行为。我只是太害怕我父母对我生气了。”这样我就能让我的孩子服从。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always tell parents, kids can't learn to tolerate feelings we can't tolerate in them. So if my kid is jealous and frustrated and that comes out as bad behavior and all I do is send them to their room, maybe short term for some kids, for people pleasing kids only, not for the non-peopleleasers, they just escalate when you punish them. My kid might look like, "Oh, I'm gonna change my behavior. I'm just so terrified of my parent being upset with me." and I can get my kid to comply.</p>
</details>

我总是觉得这很有趣。我从未见过一个家长说：“哦，我为我30岁的女儿感到骄傲。她非常顺从。人们要求她做什么她就做什么。她非常关注别人对她的期望，以至于她总是在照顾别人，而从不真正关心自己的需求，甚至不知道自己的需求是什么。”我从未听过这样的话。然而，这正是导致如此多女性最终崩溃的原因。你不会在某个发展里程碑上就自动获得管理自己情绪的技能。而惩罚和奖励纯粹是针对行为的，它们不教技能。就像我们不会通过惩罚和奖励来让孩子学会游泳一样，我们教他们如何游泳。我们教他们技能。

<p class="english-text">I always find this interesting. I've never met one parent who says, "Oh, I'm so proud of my 30-year-old daughter. She is so compliant. She does everything people ask her to do. She is so attentive to what everyone wants of her that she's just always taking care of everyone else and doesn't really ever take care of her own needs or even know what they are. I've never heard that. Although, that is the thing that leads to so many women essentially breaking down. You don't just get the skills to manage your own feelings at a certain developmental milestone. And punishment and rewards are purely behavior focused. They do not teach skills. Just like we don't punish and reward kids into learning how to swim, we teach them how to swim. We teach them skills.</p>
</details>

重要的是，对于游泳，我们明白，仅仅因为我在教一个孩子一项技能，并不意味着我的孩子明天就能学会游泳。这很有趣。作为父母，我们能容忍学习游泳所需的时间长度，尽管我们中许多人为这些课程投入了昂贵的费用。我们知道这需要时间，游泳是一项技能。我认为这实际上是一项非常重要的人生技能。而情绪调节是一项更重要的人生技能。所以我希望父母们开始思考的，不仅仅是短期的行为服从——顺便说一下，这在以后会对人产生负面影响——而是，“我拥有这段时间窗口，可以真正教给我的孩子们那些将成为他们一生中最重要技能的技能。”而惩罚和奖励根本不教技能。

<p class="english-text">And importantly with swimming, we understand that just cuz I'm teaching a kid a skill, it doesn't mean my kid's going to swim tomorrow. It's actually interesting. We tolerate the length of time it learns how to swim as a parent. Even though those are very expensive lessons a lot of us put money toward. We know this is going to take time and swimming is a skill. I think that's actually a very important life skill. Emotion regulation is an even more important life skill. And so how I want parents to start thinking is not just in terms of short-term behavioral compliance, which by the way works against someone later on, but actually I have this window of time where I can actually teach my kids the skills that are actually going to be the most important skills of their life. And punishments and rewards just don't teach skills.</p>

### “稳固型领导力”：超越“温和育儿”

很多时候我被问到，“内在良善”是“温和育儿”（gentle parenting）吗？我其实认为“温和育儿”这个词可能被误解了，但它不是一个我认同的术语。所以，我暂且把它放在一边。我不认同它的原因之一是，我认为在我们一些最重要的育儿时刻，“温和”这个词并不能描述我在那一刻所感受到的情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So many times I'm asked, is good inside gentle parenting? I actually think the term gentle parenting has probably been misrepresented, but it's just not a term I identify with. So, I'm just going to put it over here. And one of the reasons I don't identify with it is I think some of our most important parenting moments, the word gentle just isn't a word I would use to describe the feeling I'm accessing in that moment.</p>
</details>

我一些最好的育儿时刻，尽管也是最艰难的，是当我做了一些我知道必须做、并且从长远来看对我的孩子最有利的事情，但这在当下需要处理很多棘手的情况和艰难的情感。我认为那些时刻需要的是“稳固”（sturdiness），需要大量的信念。真的，如果我们放眼长远，我认为“内在良善”就是一种领导力方法。所以，它实际上是一种稳固的领导力方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of my best parenting moments, even though they're the hardest, is when I do something that I just know needs to be done and is for my kid's best interest long term, but requires a lot of trickiness and hard feelings in the moment. And I think those moments call for sturdiness, like a lot of conviction. And really, if we zoom out, I think good inside is just a leadership approach. So, it's really a sturdy leadership approach.</p>
</details>

我喜欢“稳固”这个词，我会定义它。但我喜欢它的原因之一是，它带有一种感觉，使它超越了一个单纯的词汇，并在我们的身体里产生某种作用。如果你想一想你生命中某个你认为很“稳固”的人，你就能联想到他们身上的一种特质，你能感觉到他们的存在，就像“我知道你在哪里”，但他们也能够与他人建立连接。仅仅是这个词的感觉中就蕴含着某种东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love the word sturdy and I'm going to define it. But one of the reasons I love it is it has a feeling associated with it and it takes it out of just being a word and it does something in our body. If you think about someone in your life who you consider sturdy, you can kind of conjure up this thing about them where you can kind of locate them like I know where you are but they also were able to connect to other people. There's something happening there in just the feeling of the word.</p>
</details>

所以，如果我想到一个稳固的领导者，他们能同时做两件事。他们能将自己的决定根植于自己的价值观。他们能在情境中体现出自己应有的权威，所以他们与自己是连接的。同时，一个稳固的领导者能够理解他人，倾听他们的意见，甚至理解他们的反应和感受。他们能够与他人建立连接。一个稳固的领导者能同时与自己和他人建立连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I think about a sturdy leader, they're able to do two things at once. They're able to ground their decisions in their own values. They can embody their appropriate authority in a situation so they're connected to themselves. At the same time, a sturdy leader is able to understand other people, hear them out, maybe even understand their reactions and feelings. They're able to connect to other people. A sturdy leader at the same time can connect to themselves and someone else.</p>
</details>

让我用一个比喻来解释，因为这是让这个概念生动起来的最好方式。想象一下你在飞机上，你是一名乘客，我也是。飞机遇到了非常非常剧烈的颠簸，以至于客舱里每个人都在尖叫。天哪！天哪！好的，让我们想象一下你可能会从飞行员那里听到的三种广播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let me explain a metaphor because it's actually the best way of bringing this to life. So, imagine you're on a plane and you're a passenger. I'm a passenger, too. And it gets very, very turbulent. So turbulent that everyone is kind of screaming in the passenger cabin. OH MY GOODNESS. Oh my goodness. Okay, let's imagine three announcements you might hear from a pilot.</p>
</details>

第一种广播：“后面的人别叫了！你们小题大做。你们毁了我的一切。别那么戏剧化。”我想我们都知道这并不会让我感觉好些。首先，我在想，飞行员是没感觉到剧烈的颠簸吗？还是他被我的紧张情绪威胁到了，以至于乱了方寸？这有点像当我们的孩子因为早餐不能吃冰淇淋而崩溃时，我们对他们说：“你太戏剧化了。你小题大做。”我们非常倾向于用否定来回应。我无法与另一个人建立连接，无法看到他们的现实对他们来说是真实的，即使对我来说不是。好的，这不是我们想要的广播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, announcement number one. Stop screaming back there. You're making a big deal out of nothing. You all ruin everything for me. Stop being dramatic. Now, I think we all know that wouldn't really make me feel better. First of all, I'm wondering, is the pilot missing the intense turbulence? And is the pilot so threatened by my being nervous that it kind of throws them off? Is that's kind of like when we say to our kids when they're melting down about not having ice cream for breakfast, you're so dramatic. You're making a big deal out of nothing. We kind of really lean with invalidation. I'm not able to connect to the other person. and see that their reality is real for them, even if it's not real for me. Okay, that's not the announcement we want.</p>
</details>

这是第二种飞行员，也不是我们想要的广播：“哦不，颠簸！我正在打开驾驶舱的门。如果后面有谁知道该怎么做，请进来。”如果你像我一样，你现在甚至不再害怕颠簸了。你只是害怕这个人是你的飞行员。那么这里发生了什么？飞行员失去了自我。在第一种情况下，他们失去了与他人的连接。在第二种情况下，他们失去了与自己的连接。他们把你的情绪看作是会传染的。你紧张，那就意味着我也紧张。我们现在处境完全相同。这有点像当我们的孩子因为早餐问题而崩溃时，我们说：“好吧，早餐吃冰淇淋吧。只要别再发脾气了。”重要的是，我做这个决定并不是因为我真的想给我的孩子早餐吃冰淇淋——那也可能是我的决定。我这样做是因为我真的、真的讨厌看到我的孩子难过，他们的情绪仿佛进入了我的身体，我只是想让自己的这种感觉停止。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's pilot two. Also not the announcement we want. Oh no, turbulence. I'm opening up the cockpit doors. If anyone back there kind of knows what to do, please come in. Now, if you're like me, you're not even scared of the turbulence anymore. You're just terrified that this person is your pilot. So, what's happening there? The pilot loses themsself. In the first kind of situation, they lose connection to someone else. In the second, they lose connection to themsel. They see your feelings almost as contagious. You're nervous, that means I'm nervous. And we're in this exact same situation together. That's kind of when we say to our kid who's melting down over breakfast. Fine, have ice cream for breakfast. Just stop tantruming. And importantly, I'm not making that decision because I actually think I want to give my kid ice cream for breakfast, which could be my decision. I'm doing it because I really, really hate seeing my kid upset and their feelings kind of come into my body and I just want that feeling for me to stop.</p>
</details>

好的，让我们来看看第三种飞行员，因为我认为这是我们都想要的飞行员：“嘿，我听到你们在后面尖叫了。我理解。你们因为颠簸很剧烈而紧张。没关系。尽管叫吧。做你们该做的。我知道我在做什么。我以前经历过这种情况，我现在要结束广播，回去做我的工作。我知道我很快就能把我们带到目的地。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's get to the third pilot because I think this is the pilot we all want. Hey, I hear you screaming back there. I get it. You're nervous because it's so turbulent. That's okay. Scream away. Do your thing. I know what I'm doing. I've been through this before and I'm going to stop this announcement now and go back to doing my job. And I know I'm going to get us to our destination shortly.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，颠簸可能保持完全一样，甚至可能变得更糟一点。但突然间，我深深地松了一口气。为什么？因为稳固的领导者能做两件事。他们能看到你的情绪现实是真实的，并且关心它，同时他们自己不会被它压垮。这意味着他们实际上在你和他们之间建立了一个边界。我能共情你的感受，恰恰因为我没有自己承担这种感受。我能看到你相信自己正处于这场风暴中。同时，我能看到另一边的平静、希望和安全。我能同时做到这两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interestingly, the turbulence could stay the exact same, maybe even get a little worse. But suddenly, I have a deep breath of relief. Why? Two things that sturdy leaders do. They see your emotional reality as real and they care about it while they are not overwhelmed by it themselves. That means they actually have a boundary between you and them. I can empathize with your feeling precisely because I'm not taking on the feeling myself. I can see that you believe you're in this storm. And at the same time, I can see calm and hope and safety on the other side. I can do both of those things at once.</p>
</details>

这有点像当我们的孩子因为想吃冰淇淋当早餐而崩溃时，我们对他们说：“我懂了。你真的很想吃冰淇淋。哦，我也会想吃的。你希望你能吃冰淇淋。但是，宝贝，冰淇淋不是一个选项。你难过没关系。我们会解决的。等你想要的时候，告诉我你早餐可以吃点别的什么。”我能看到我孩子的情绪现实，但我没有被它占据。我在风暴中保持了这种稳固性。而这正是我们的孩子希望从我们这里得到的领导力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's kind of when we say to our kid who's melting down about wanting ice cream for breakfast. I get it. You really want ice cream. Oh, I would want that, too. You wish you could have ice cream. And ice cream's not an option, sweetie. It's okay if you're upset. We're going to figure this out. And when you want, let me know something else you could have for breakfast. I can see my kids emotional reality, but I'm not taken over by it. and I have this sturdiness in the middle of the storm. And that's exactly the type of leadership our kids are looking for from us.</p>

### 第二章：理解我们自己的“出厂设置”

依恋理论深刻影响了我谈论日常育儿时刻的方式。依恋理论由约翰·鲍比（John Bowlby）和玛丽·安斯沃斯（Mary Ainsworth）在很久以前推广开来。依恋理论的基础理念是，我们在孩子最早的几年里与他们形成的关系的性质，会影响他们一生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, attachment theory really influences a lot of how I talk about day-to-day moments in parenting. Attachment theory was popularized by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth a very long time ago. And really the foundation of attachment theory is the idea that the nature of the relationship we form with our kid in their earliest years is something that impacts them for the rest of their life.</p>
</details>

对孩子来说，连接是他们生存的关键。这实际上是一种进化力量。依恋是孩子们的关键进化力量，因为在很长很长一段时间里，比几乎任何其他动物物种都长，一个人类孩子真的无法独自生存。是的，他们需要食物、住所、水，但他们从父母那里获得这些。所以孩子们总是在寻找：什么能让我与父母保持连接？我的哪些部分是可爱的、可被理解的？我的哪些部分是孤独存在的？而那些孤独存在的部分变得非常危险，对吧？然后常常不得不被表现出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Connection for kids is the key to their survival. It's really an evolutionary force. Attachment is the key evolutionary force for kids because for a very very long time, more than almost any other animal species, a human child truly can't survive on their own. Yes, they need food, shelter, water, but they get that from their parent. And so kids are always looking what allows me to stay connected to my parents, what parts of me are lovable and understandable, and what parts of me kind of exist in aloneeness. And those parts that exist in aloneeness become very dangerous, right? And often then have to get acted out.</p>
</details>

他们实际上是在和我们一起学习：我是谁？我被允许拥有哪些感受？当我们经历困难时，我可以从周围的人那里期待什么？对一个我爱的人生气可以吗？在一段关系中犯错可以吗？我有恢复的途径吗？还是这看起来几乎是无法恢复的？我的哪些部分能得到爱和连接，哪些部分则会被告知“我们家不这样做”，然后我不得不学会“哦，危险，把它们收起来”。我从父母那里学到这些教训，因为在某种程度上，我的父母就是我的世界，随着我长大，我开始将这些教训推广到整个世界。所以，我们的孩子与我们形成的关系的性质，就成了一种蓝图，或者我一个叫Mileique的朋友称之为她孩子的“出厂设置”。我喜欢这个说法，因为我们可以改变出厂设置，我们可以改变默认值，但同时，我们的孩子带着进入成年的出厂设置是相当强大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're really learning with us. Who am I? What feelings am I allowed to have? What can I expect from people around me when we're going through hard situations? Is it okay to be mad at someone I love? Is it okay to mess up in a relationship? Do I have a pathway to recover? or is that something that seems almost unreoverable? What parts of me get love and connection and what parts of me are kind of met with we don't do that in this family and I kind of have to learn ooh danger put them away and I take those lessons from my parent because in a way my parent is my world and I start to generalize them as I get older to the world and so the nature of a relationship our kid forms with us becomes kind of a blueprint or a friend of mine named Mileique calls it her kids factory settings where I love that because we can change factory settings, we can change a default and at the same time the factory settings our kid goes into adulthood with are pretty powerful.</p>
</details>

### 依恋理论：童年关系如何塑造我们的“出厂设置”

举个例子，当我的孩子因为一件我认为在我的成年生活中很小，但在我孩子的生活中很重要的事情而崩溃时——我不知道，也许是“哦，我没和索菲亚分在一个班。我今年不能去上学了。”我的孩子崩溃了，他们在哭，说“这都是你的错。”当然，这与我无关。但如果我对此的普遍反应模式是这样的：“你太荒谬了。如果你再哭，我就拿走你的……（随便填空）。”我的孩子学到的不是：“我对二年级的分班反应过度了，下次我可以更冷静地回应。”不，他们学到了几件事。第一，在我最亲密的关系中，感到难过是不安全的。当我为生活中的某件事非常难过时，我应该预料到我亲近的人会对此非常反感，并且不想与我扯上任何关系。这是他们学到的一个教训。他们可能学到的另一个教训是：“哦，也许我不知道自己的感受。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example, when my kid has a meltdown about something that I think is small in my adult life but matters in my kid life, I don't know, maybe oh I'm not with Sophia in class. I can't go to school this year. Are my kids melting down? They're crying. It's all your fault. Of course, I have nothing to do with it. But if my general pattern of responding to this is something like, "You're being ridiculous. If you keep crying, I'm taking away, I don't know, fill in the blank with whatever it is." My kid does not learn. I'm having a big reaction to classes in second grade, and I can respond more calmly next time. No, they learn a couple things. Number one, it's not safe in my closest relationships to feel upset. When I'm very upset about something in my life, I should expect the people close to me to be very turned off by that and want nothing to do with me. That's one lesson they learn. Another lesson they learn might be, "Oh, maybe I don't know how I feel."</p>
</details>

我的父母总是告诉我我对事情反应过度。所以，我猜别人比我更清楚我的感受。现在，如果我们把这两个教训快进，这可能听起来很明显，但我总是思考这个问题。我们今天的身体和我们童年时的身体是同一个，它是所有记忆的集合。我们的身体喜欢泛化。就像你很小的时候学会过马路要左右看一样，你成年后可能在一个完全不同的环境里。如果有人说：“你在这里不用左右看。你可以直接过马路。汽车不会伤到你。”你的身体根本不会允许你这样做，因为它把一个早期的关于安全的教训泛化了。没错，我从没去过东京，但我会假设那里的情况和我一直以来知道的一样，我会左右看以确保安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My parent did always tell me I overreacted to things. So, I guess other people have a better sense of how I feel than I do. Now, if we just take those two lessons and we fast forward, this might sound obvious, but I always think about it. We have the same body today as we had our childhood. It's a collection of all of the memories. And our body likes to generalize. Just like you learn to look both ways before you cross the street early on, you could be in a totally different environment in adulthood. And if someone said, "You don't have to look both ways here. You can just cross the road. Cars won't hurt you." Your body literally wouldn't allow you to do that because it took an early lesson around safety and has generalized. It's true. I've never been to Tokyo, but I'm going to assume the same thing is true as it's always been. and I'm going to look both ways to keep me safe.</p>
</details>

所以现在，假设我的孩子已经不在我家了，我编造一个情景，他和一个什么人结婚了。他们因为工作上的一次糟糕会议而非常难过。他们的身体会进行一次盘点：“和我的丈夫谈论这件事安全吗？还是我基本上会预料到我丈夫会告诉我我小题大做？”所以我就不谈了。但情绪依然存在。你知道可能会发生什么吗？我不知道。我可能会因为一些完全不相干的事情对我丈夫发火。我可能会对我的孩子们非常不耐烦。我可能会以其他方式表现出来，因为我们的情绪不会说谎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now, let's say my kid is no longer in my house, and I'm making this up, is married to someone. And they're really upset about a bad meeting at work. Their body is going to kind of do an inventory. Is this safe, let's say, for me to talk to my husband about or am I basically going to expect my husband to tell me I'm making a big deal out of nothing? So then I don't talk about it. But the feelings remain. You know what probably happens? I don't know. I'm probably snapping at my husband about something totally irrelevant. I'm probably super short with my kids. I'm probably acting it out in some other ways because our feelings don't lie.</p>
</details>

这是依恋的一种遗留影响。另一种遗留影响是，当我们总是否定我们的孩子，听起来就像：“你太戏剧化了。你小题大做。这是一个不成比例的反应。”他们会以非常危险的方式怀疑自己的情绪。我就直说了，因为我比较直接。让我们想象一个二十几岁的女孩，25岁，在酒吧里，有人走过来和她搭讪。感觉很有趣。一个陌生人，他们不认识。然后事情更进一步：“跟我回家吧。”那个女孩，假设她最初身体里有一种感觉，像是：“哦，我不太确定。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's one kind of legacy of attachment. Another legacy is when we invalidate our kids all the time, which sounds like, you're dramatic. You're making a big deal out of nothing. This is a disproportionate reaction. They doubt their emotions in really dangerous ways. I'm just going to go for it because I'm pretty direct. Let's picture a girl who's now at a bar at age 20 something, 25, and someone comes up to them and they're kind of flirty. It feels fun. Stranger, they don't know. And then it goes a step further. Come home with me. And that girl, let's say, initially has a feeling in her body like, oo, I don't know about this.</p>
</details>

那么，她早期在完全不同的情境中学到的依恋教训是什么，但却是相同的回路？“别人往往比我更清楚我应该有什么感觉。”然后她听到：“来吧，别小题大做了。会很有趣的。”“没错，我确实倾向于小题大做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, what's the attachment lessons that she might have learned early on in totally different situations, but the same circuits? Other people do tend to know how I should feel better than I do. And then she hears, "Come on, don't make such a big deal out of it. It's just going to be fun." It's true. I do tend to make a big deal out of nothing.</p>
</details>

我知道，很容易会说这太疯狂了。这和因为分班而抓狂毫无关系。但在我们的身体里，在围绕着“我是否信任我的情绪？我是否倾听正在发生的事情，即使它对我很重要，对别人不重要？我能跟着我的直觉走，还是用别人的反应作为我应该做什么的晴雨表？”的盘点中，这些绝对是相同的情境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know it's so easy to say that is crazy. That has nothing to do with freaking out about classes. In our body, in the inventory that happens around, do I trust my emotions? Do I listen to what's happening is something that's a big deal to me? Even if it's not a big deal to someone else, can I go with my gut or do I use someone else's reaction as a barometer of what I should do? Those are absolutely the same situations inside of our body.</p>
</details>

### 内在家庭系统：理解我们的“保护者”部分

依恋理论认为，我们最早的关系构成了我们后来关系的蓝图。而内在家庭系统（Internal Family Systems）的基本理念是，我们身体内部有许多许多不同的部分。所以，如果你把这两者结合起来，你也可以说，我们年轻时发展出的部分，也会在我们年长后的成人关系中表现出来。内在家庭系统提出的一个非常强大的观点是，我们所有不同的部分都源于一个适应性的地方。它们都在我们最早的几年里试图弄清楚：“我需要做什么才能在我的原生家庭中生存和适应？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Attachment theory is this idea that our earliest relationships form the blueprint for our later relationships. But internal family systems is basically the idea that inside our bodies we have many many parts of us. So if you put that together you could also say the way we develop parts when we're young will also play out in our adult relationships when we're older. And what internal family systems posits which is so powerful is that all of our different parts came from an adaptive place. They were all trying to figure out in our earliest years, what do I need to do to survive and adapt in my family of origin?</p>
</details>

举个例子，假设愤怒不是一种你可以安全地向你父母表达的情感。事实是，愤怒是一种强大的情感。所以，当我们年轻时，我们倾向于不对父母说：“我生你的气。”我们倾向于说：“我恨你。”对吧？或者，“你是世界上最糟糕的爸爸。你什么都不为我做。”甚至可能是在我们的父母刚带我们去了一个游乐园之后。现在，当那种感觉出现时，如果我们遭遇到某种危险，对吧？“回你的房间去。你不许那样跟我说话。一周不准（插入惩罚）。”或者更糟，也许我们被打了。那么，我作为一个孩子的身体必须学到什么？我实际上学到的不是“我应该用更好的方式表达我的愤怒。”我实际上学到的是，“愤怒不是一种安全的情感。如果我当时不感到愤怒，我在家里会安全得多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, for example, let's say anger was not something you could safely express toward your parent. The truth is anger is a powerful emotion. So, when we're young, we tend not to say to our parent, "I'm angry at you." We tend to say, "I hate you." Right? Or, "You're the worst dad in the world. you don't do anything for me. Even maybe after our parents just took us to an amusement park. Right now, when that feeling comes out, if we were met with some type of danger, right? Go to your room. You don't say something like that to me. No insert punishment here for a week or maybe worse. Maybe we were hit. Then what does my body as a kid have to learn? I actually don't learn I should have expressed my anger in a better way. I actually learned anger is not a safe emotion. If I just didn't feel angry, I would have been a lot safer in my home.</p>
</details>

现在，从内在家庭系统的角度来看，我们如何停止愤怒？这有点难。它是一种自然的情感。我发展出了一个新的部分。它实际上会被称为——这很美——一个“保护者”部分，它试图保护我免于感受那种愤怒。它真的在努力帮助我保持安全。现在，这个保护者部分可能不得不使用一些极端的方法。它可能需要对我说：“你是个可怕的、忘恩负义的人。没有别人会这样感觉。”我知道这听起来很刻薄。贝姬博士，这听起来不像是适应性的。但愤怒是相当强大的。如果在你的家里表达愤怒是如此可怕，你的身体实际上想出了如何发展出一个同样强大的部分来压制它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, from an internal family systems perspective, how do we stop anger? It's kind of hard. It's a natural emotion. I develop a new part. It would actually be called, and it's so beautiful, a protector part that's trying to protect me from feeling that anger. It's trying to really help me stay safe. Now, the protector part might have to use some extreme methods. It might need to say to me, "You're a horrible, ungrateful person. No one else would feel this way." And I know that sounds mean. Dr. Becky, that doesn't sound adaptive, but anger is pretty powerful. And if it was so scary to express anger in your home, your body actually figured out how to develop a part that was equally as powerful to shut it down.</p>
</details>

现在，让我们快进20年、40年。我想我们都知道，即使在理论上，我们都会对我们爱的人生气。这是会发生的。但就像依恋理论教给我们的，我们成人关系中发生的事情，很多都是我们最早教训的重新激活。所以，假设你开始对你的伴侣感到愤怒。但这时，有一个保护者部分在用你八岁时的方式对你说话。它不知道现在是2025年还是什么年份。它仍然认为现在是，我不知道，1980年。所以，它对你说：“不要生气。你难道不感激你的伴侣吗？你有什么问题。”所以，你压制了愤怒。你因为这个曾经保护你的保护者部分而压制了愤怒。也许它现在不再保护你了，但它认为它在保护你。然后我们都知道会发生什么。我们压制它，压制它。然后有一个时刻，哦天哪，它以如此爆炸性的方式爆发出来，不是因为我们有什么问题，而是因为我们没有早点释放那些压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, let's fast forward 20 years, 40 years. I think we know even theoretically we all get angry at the people we love. That happens. But just like attachment theory teaches us, what happens in our adult relationships becomes a lot of reactivation of our earliest lessons. So let's say you start to feel angry toward your partner. But then there's this protector part that's talking to you the same way as when you were eight. It doesn't know that it's 2025 or whatever year it is now. It still thinks it's, I don't know, 1980. So, it says to you, "Don't be angry. Do you not appreciate your partner? Something's wrong with you." So, you shut down anger. You shut down anger because of this protector part that used to protect you. Maybe isn't protecting you anymore, but it thinks it's protecting you. And then we all know what happens. We shut it down. We shut it down. And then there's a moment, oh boy, it comes out with such explosiveness, not because anything's wrong with us, but because we didn't kind of let out the steam earlier.</p>

### 如何利用过去重塑现在

当我和人们谈论这个时，他们会说：“好吧，所以我们只要摆脱那些保护者部分，对吧？”嗯，我们不能，因为从内在家庭系统的角度来看，那个部分的发展是有原因的。我们实际上必须从感谢那个部分开始。“谢谢你这么多年来保护我。你是对的。你做了一件非常重要的工作。表达愤怒是不安全的。没有人帮助我学习如何表达愤怒。没有人给我一个跑道，让我作为一个小孩知道，‘哦，贝姬当然不会表达愤怒。她才五岁。’情况并非如此。所以，你这么多年来如此巧妙地想出了某种压制愤怒的方法。现在，我在这里告诉你，我不再是五岁了。我处于一个不同的情境中。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, when I talk about this with people, people say, "Okay, so we just got to like get rid of the protector parts, right?" Well, we don't because from an internal family systems perspective, that part developed for a reason. We actually have to start by thanking that part. Thank you for all the years you kept me safe. You are right. You were doing a really important job. Expressing anger was not safe. And nobody helped me learn to express anger. And nobody gave me a runway as a young kid to know, well, of course Becky's not going to express anger. Well, she's only five. That was not the case. And so, you were so crafty for so long in figuring out some way of shutting anger down. Now, I'm here to tell you, I'm not five anymore. I'm in a different situation.</p>
</details>

我会请求你在某些时刻稍微退后一步，这样我就可以练习以健康的方式表达我的愤怒，即使是对我爱的人。随着时间的推移，你可能会有点担心，但我们会一起解决这个问题。”这会是一种基于IFS的干预，我们学习与我们的部分建立连接，理解它们最初的功能，抱有同情心，这样做，它们就不再对我们有那么大的控制力了。所以，这种IFS的视角深刻影响了我对发展的思考，我如何帮助父母，以及我最喜欢的一些教给父母与孩子一起做的干预措施，也是基于IFS并受其启发的。如果我们能帮助我们的孩子从小就学会识别他们的部分，那是导致日后韧性的最具适应性的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm going to ask you for some moments to kind of step back a little bit so I can practice expressing my anger in healthy ways, even to people I love. And over time, you might get a little worried, but we're kind of going to figure this out together. And that would be kind of an IFSbased intervention where we're learning to connect to our parts, understand their original function, have compassion, and in doing that they stop having such hold on us. And so this IFS perspective has really influenced how I think about development, how I help parents, but also some of my favorite interventions to actually teach parents to do with children is IFSbased and inspired. If we can help our kids learn to kind of recognize their parts early, that's one of the most adaptive things that leads to resilience later on.</p>
</details>

所以在成年后，我们总是面临这些让我们感到好奇的事情。“哦，那是我倾向于这样做的原因之一吗？”让我们谈谈依恋。每当我感到非常难过，甚至可能对我的伴侣感到难过时，我倾向于退缩。我倾向于退缩。我有点把他们推开。如果我开始学习，“嗯，如果我在我生命中的某个时刻这样做，那是不是适应性的？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all the time in adulthood, we are faced with these things that we become curious about. Oh, is that one of the reasons I tend to act this way? Let's talk about attachment. Whenever I feel really upset, even maybe at my partner, I tend to pull away. I tend to pull away. I kind of push them away. If I start to learn, huh, if I do that at some point in my life, was that adaptive?</p>
</details>

在我最早的几年里，学会“当我有强烈的情绪时，你最好的选择——虽然不理想——但你最好的选择是退缩”，这可能是适应性的。这是你在成年生活中前进的第一个拥有巨大力量的时刻。在理解事物之前，我们无法改变事物。就像我们总是在“内在良善”中说的那样，我们必须先理解再干预。理解本身并不能改变事物，但它是必要的第一步。所以你可能会反思，“等一下。我甚至对我丈夫、我的孩子、工作中的某个人表现出的这种风格，是的，现在有事情发生，但也可能是一些来自过去的早期模式的重新激活。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">might have been adaptive in my earliest years to have learned when I'm feeling big feelings, your best bet, it's not ideal, but your best bet is to pull away. That is your first moment of like immense power going forward in your adult life. We can't change things before we understand things. Like we always say that at goods inside, we have to understand before we intervene. And understanding doesn't change things on its own, but it's a necessary first step. So you might reflect, hold on a second. This style that I even play out with my husband, with my kid, with someone at work, yeah, there's stuff going on in the present moment, but also it might be some type of reactivation or early pattern from the past.</p>
</details>

我认为下一步是，“我能了解它吗？”阻止我们了解它的是我们感到如此多的羞耻。我鼓励人们把这种认识或好奇心，几乎像是放在一个架子上，然后看着它。“嗯，那很有趣。嗯，我想知道我还能知道些什么。嗯，我想我要了解你。我想我要拿这本书。”有很多关于依恋的书。我们在“内在良善”教了很多关于一种叫做“修复”（reparing）的东西，关于触发点，这完全不是关于责备你的父母。对我来说，责备是一种非常无力的举动。那不是我们做的。它实际上是关于理解。“我为什么是现在的我？为什么我做一些我不想做但它就是不断发生的事情？”如果我们能了解这一点，那么我们就可以开始和某人谈论它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then the next step I think is, can I learn about it? The thing that stops us from learning about it is we feel like there's so much shame. I encourage people to kind of take this realization or curiosity and almost like put it on a shelf and look at it. Hm, that's interesting. H I wonder what else I could know about that. Hm, I think I'm going to learn about you. I think I'm going to take this book. There's so many books about attachment. There's so much we teach at Good Inside about something called reparing, about triggers, which is not at all about blaming your parents. Blaming to me is such a powerless move. That's not what we do. It's actually about understanding. Why am I the way I am? And why do I do things that I don't want to do, but it just keeps happening? And if we can learn about that, then we can actually start to talk about it with someone.</p>
</details>

我可能会对我的伴侣说：“你知道吗，我了解到关于我自己的一些事。当我难过的时候，即使我真的需要一些支持，但在过去，在我认识你之前，我从未真正得到过那种支持。所以，我会做的一件事就是退缩。你有没有觉得我对你那样做？也许就像我变得非常非常暴躁，甚至刻薄，那是不对的，然后后来我们意识到我其实在工作上度过了非常艰难的一周。”你的伴侣可能会看着你说：“是的。”这实际上会感觉很难，但我向你保证，这可以是一个建立新型连接的美好时刻，当你们几乎都在看着架子上的这个东西，像是：“是的，那有点是真的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I might say to my partner, you know what I've learned about myself when I'm upset. Even though I kind of could really use some support in the past, before I even knew you, I never really got that support. So, one of the things I would do is kind of pull away. Do you ever feel like I do that to you? Maybe like I get really really snappy and even mean, which is not okay, and then later we realize I'd actually been having this really hard week at work. Your partner might look and be like, "Yeah." which actually it can feel hard, but I promise you it can be this beautiful moment of a new type of connection when you're almost both looking at this thing in the shelf like, "Yeah, that's kind of true."</p>
</details>

我认为在最好的伴侣关系中，双方都在理解我最早的依恋如何影响我今天带来的东西。你了解你自己，你也了解彼此，因为当一个伴侣开始看到，“哦，我想她正在做那个退缩的事情。”这并不意味着让事情变好是我的工作。但实际上有一点清晰度，我可能会在一个艰难的时刻对我的伴侣说：“嘿，看，过去一周真的很艰难。我觉得你一直很暴躁，让我们解决这个问题。我也知道，根据我们的谈话，你可能正在经历一些艰难和脆弱的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think in the best partnerships, both people are understanding how my earliest attachments influence what I'm bringing today. and you learn about yourself and you learn about each other because it's amazing when a partner can start to see, "Oh, I think she's doing that pulling away thing." It doesn't mean it's my job to make this better. But actually having a little clarity, I might say to my partner in a hard moment, "Hey, look, the last week has been really hard. I feel like you've been really snippy and let's figure that out. I also know based on our conversations, there might be something hard and vulnerable you're going through.</p>
</details>

你可以和我谈谈。这和早期不一样了。我知道这会感觉很难，因为这是新的。你为什么不花点时间，因为暴躁和对我发火，我知道那不是你想要继续的样子。我知道对你来说尝试新事物将是一次信念的飞跃。但我知道我们都在为此努力。我会请你这样做。我们为什么不找个时间，你可以告诉我到底发生了什么？”这就是我们最早的依恋给我们信息来赋予我们力量的地方。它们绝不会把我们置于某种监狱中。

<p class="english-text">You can talk to me about that. This is not the same as early on. And I know it's going to feel hard because it's new.

And I know it's going to be a leap of faith for you to try something new. But I know we're both working on this. I'm going to ask you to do that. Why don't we find a time and you can tell me what's really going on? And this is where our earliest attachments give us information to empower ourselves. and in no way do they kind of put us in some type of prison.</p>

### 第三章：如何在任何年龄调节你的情绪

### 情绪调节：一项可以习得的技能

有些事情我们可以做来提高我们的情绪调节技能。第一是真正意识到它是一项技能。我认为育儿也是一项技能。这实际上是我们“内在良善”所做的一切的基础。我们一直被告知，育儿是天生的。你应该自然就知道该怎么做。我一直从父母那里听到这样的话：“我和我的孩子相处得很挣扎。他们总是发脾气。我总是对他们大喊大叫。”然后他们会说：“是的，我在Instagram上看到了一些技巧。嗯，我这里那里读了一本书。”但当你真正意识到，“等一下。这是一项技能。在我生命中任何我真正关心的其他领域，我都会投资学习技能。我寻求一些专业帮助。我练习。”这实际上是非常赋能的。这是力量的象征。只是育儿一直被告知我们，它是自然而然的事情，这就是为什么当我们挣扎时，我们感到羞耻并独自承受。这实际上是我最希望改变的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are things we can do to improve our emotion regulation skills. Number one is actually just realizing it's a skill. I think parenting is a skill, too. That's actually what everything we do at Good Inside is based on. We've been told forever, parenting comes naturally. You should just know what to do. I hear this from parents all the time. I'm struggling with my kid. They're having these tantrums. I'm yelling them all the time and then they say, "Yeah, I'm getting tips on Instagram. Um, I read a book here or there." But when you really realize, hold on a second. This is a skill. Any other area of my life that I really care about? I invest in learning skills. I get some professional help. I practice. That's actually so empowering. That's a sign of strength. It's just that parenting has always been told to us. It's something that just comes naturally, which is why we feel shame and we stay alone when we're struggling. That's actually the biggest thing I hope to change.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，有很多事情我们可以做来改善我们的育儿，或者改善情绪调节，这绝对是育儿的一部分。依恋理论和情绪调节是紧密相连的概念。孩子天生拥有所有的情绪，却没有管理这些情绪的技能。这个差距，对吧，解释了为什么孩子和成人会行为失常。就是当情绪大于技能时。但关于这些技能，与某些其他技能不同的是，它们很少只是在教科书或教室里被教导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, yes, there are so many things we can do to work on our parenting or to work on emotion regulation, which is definitely a part of parenting. Attachment theory and emotion regulation are deeply connected concepts. Kids are born with all of the emotions and none of the skills to manage those emotions. That gap, right, explains why kids and adults act out. It's when emotions are greater than skills. But the thing about these skills that's different than some other skills is they're rarely just taught in a textbook or in a classroom.</p>
</details>

孩子们通过与父母的依恋关系来学习管理情绪的技能。这引出了失调（dysregulation）、**共同调节**（co-regulation: 指个体（尤其是儿童）通过与一个更平静、更有调节能力的他人（如父母）互动，来帮助自己调节情绪的过程）以及我们都想要的情绪调节（emotion regulation）的概念。让我来解释一下。因为孩子天生拥有所有的情绪而没有任何技能，他们常常处于失调状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kids learn skills to manage their emotions through their attachment with their parents. This brings up the concept of dysregulation and then co-regulation and then the thing we all want emotion regulation. So let me explain. Because kids are born with all of the emotions and none of the skills. They're often in a state of disregulation.</p>
</details>

这实际上只意味着我的情绪大于我的技能。所以，我的情绪以发脾气、大爆发、也许是“我恨你”、在地板上打滚的形式表现出来。这是一种失调状态。我的孩子有强烈的情绪，但没有管理的技能。好的。什么是共同调节？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All that really means is my emotions are greater than my skills. So, my emotions come out as a tantrum, as a huge outburst, maybe as an I hate you, as flailing on the floor. That is a state of disregulation. My kid is having big emotions but doesn't have skills to manage. Okay. What's co-regulation?</p>
</details>

孩子们从失调到调节的最强大方式之一，是通过借用父母的调节能力。让我们想象一下这个场景。我的孩子正在崩溃。为什么？因为我把他的烤奶酪三明治切成了三角形，而不是长方形。典型的崩溃。这可能只是代表了“我今天有很多事情没有按我想象的方式进行，我的挫折桶已经满了，而三角形的烤奶酪只是让它溢出的最后一根稻草。”我的孩子在地板上失调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the ways and the most powerful ways kids get from disregulation to regulation is through borrowing a parent's regulation. So, let's picture the scene. My kid is melting down. Why? Because I cut their grilled cheese into triangles, not rectangles. Classic meltdown. which is probably just representative of there have been so many things in my day that didn't go the way I imagined and my bucket of frustration is full and the triangle of grilled cheese is just the thing that spills it all out. My kid is disregulated on the floor.</p>
</details>

孩子们最终学会如何在面对挫折或失望时进行调节，是通过他们一次又一次、一次又一次地经历一个能够在孩子失调的时刻保持相对冷静的照顾者。这几乎就像，这是我失调的孩子在地板上打滚。这是我的冷静。这几乎就像冷静可以从我的身体转移到我孩子的身体里。现在我的孩子有了这么多的冷静。不多，但它在增长。你几乎可以想象，嗯，我的孩子什么时候能保持完全冷静？很大一部分是重复，一次又一次。我的父母保持冷静。我通过共同调节吸收了足够的冷静，它在我的身体里，我可以调用它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How kids learn eventually to regulate even in the face of frustration or disappointment is that they experience over and over and over and over and over again a caregiver who was able to stay relatively calm in the moment the kid was disregulated. It's almost like here's my disregulated kid flailing on the floor. Here's my calm. And it's almost like the calm can transfer from my body to my kids. And now my kid has this much calm. Not much, but it's growing. You can almost imagine this is, well, when will my kid be able to stay totally calm? A big part of it is the repetition over and over and over. My parents stayed calm. I've absorbed through co-regulation enough of that calm regulation that it's in my body and I can access it.</p>
</details>

你看，对一个孩子来说，最可怕的事情是当他们变得失调和不知所措时，这基本上就像“我身体里的情绪是如此可怕，以至于它们控制了我。”这是一种非常无助的状态。但想象一下你四岁的孩子处于那种无助的状态，然后他们看到他们赖以生存的父母，然后看到，“哦不，那些让我感到不知所措的事情，对我的父母来说也是不知所措的。我的父母无法在这种情况下保持冷静。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">See, the scariest thing to a kid is when they get disregulated and overwhelmed, which is essentially like the feelings in my body are so scary that they take me over. That's such a helpless state. But imagine your four-year-old in that helpless state and then they see their parent who they depend on for survival and see, "Oh no, the things that feel overwhelming to me are also overwhelming to my parent. My parent can't stay calm with this."</p>
</details>

这就是那种你在有颠簸时抓狂，飞行员在有颠簸时也抓狂的情况。你最终，即使作为一个成年人，在颠簸中感到安全的方式，实际上可能是通过一次又一次地乘坐有颠簸的航班，并从飞行员那里吸收调节能力。你开始自己相信它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's that situation where you're freaking out when there's turbulence and pilots freaking out when there's turbulence. The way you're eventually, even as an adult, going to feel safe amidst turbulence is actually probably going on flights over and over that have turbulence and absorbing the regulation from the pilot. You start to believe it yourself.</p>
</details>

所以，通过孩子与照顾者的依恋关系，他们开始看到，那些让我不知所措的事情，可能不会永远让我不知所措。那些让我失去平衡、感觉无法忍受的事情，对我最重要、最安全的成年人来说，实际上是可以忍受的。一次又一次地，这让一个孩子从失调到共同调节，再到最终的情绪调节状态。我应该说，我们从未完全生活在情绪调节中。所有成年人仍然需要其他成年人有时来帮助共同调节。这就是为什么当你度过了糟糕的一天，你和一些朋友出去吃饭，他们说：“哦，那太糟了。我也经历过。”你会想：“等等，那太奇怪了。我的一天没有任何改变，但我实际上感觉好多了。”我们吸收了一些验证和冷静，也许有人以一种我们忘记了我们可以相信自己的方式相信我们。我们即使作为成年人也仍然需要共同调节，但希望我们不像我们的孩子那样经常依赖它。我向你保证，你的孩子成年后不会这样，如果他们在早年经历了很多次那样的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so through a kid's attachment relationship with a caregiver, they start to see things that overwhelm me might not overwhelm me forever. things that kind of knock me off my rocker and feel intolerable actually are tolerable to my most important safest adult. And that over and over brings a kid from disregulation to co-regulation to that eventual state of emotion regulation. I should say that we never fully live in emotion regulation. All adults still need other adults in time to help co-regulate. That's why when you've had a horrible day and you go out with some friends and you're having dinner and they say, "Oh, that stinks. I've been there, too." You're like, "Wait, that's so weird. Nothing about my day changed, but I'm actually feeling better." We absorb some of the validation and calm, and maybe someone believes in us in a way we forgot that we could believe in oursel. We still need co-regulation even as adults, but hopefully we're not as dependent on it as often as our kids. And I promise you, your kid won't be as an adult if they've gone through that motion a bunch of times in their early years.</p>
</details>

我们同时持有对立真相的能力，是我们心理健康和成功的成人关系中最重要的事物之一。我会解释这两者。我们的感受，我们的内在状态，非常复杂。我们很少只感觉到一件事。例如，在为人父母的过程中，你可能会觉得：“我爱我的孩子，以一种我从未爱过世界上任何人的方式。”你也可能会想：“我有点想念我没有孩子之前的生活。”如果我们被迫调和这两个想法，好像只有一个能是真的。当我有了“哦天哪，我想念我没有孩子之前的生活”这个想法时，我开始告诉自己一个故事：“我是个可怕的人。什么样的父母会说那样的话？我为了怀孕付出了那么多。我是个怪物。好父母不会那样想。”你可以想象从那里开始的负面下降螺旋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our ability to hold opposing truths at the same time is one of the most important things for our mental health and successful adult relationships. I'll explain both. Our feelings, our internal states are very complicated. Very rarely do we just feel one thing. For example, in parenthood, you might feel like, I love my kid in a way I've never loved anyone in the world. And you might also think, I kind of miss my pre-child life. If we're forced to reconcile those two thoughts as if only one of them can be true. When I have the thought of, "Oh my goodness, I miss my pre-child life," I start telling myself a story. I'm a horrible person. What kind of parent would say that? I had to do so much to get pregnant. I'm a monster. Good parents don't think that way. You can imagine the negative downward spiral from there.</p>
</details>

好像有了那个想法就意味着我不爱我的孩子。当我们能对自己说——这有点像“内在良善”的口头禅——“等等，两件事都是真的。我爱我的孩子胜过我爱过的世界上任何人或任何事。而且，有些时候我会想念我没有孩子之前的生活。”我不必调和这两件事。我可以说它们都是真的。我有一种内心的平静。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As if having that thought means I don't love the heck out of my kid. When we can say to ourselves, and this is kind of a good inside catchphrase, wait, two things are true. I love my kid more than I've loved anyone or anything in the world. And there are moments when I miss my pre-child life. I don't have to reconcile those two things. I can just say they're both true. I have a type of internal peace.</p>
</details>

现在，能够持有两个看似对立的真相，对于任何成功的关系也至关重要。也就是说，我与我的孩子的关系，我与我的丈夫的关系，我与我的同事的关系。人们看待事物的方式不同。当我们需要别人以与我们完全相同的方式看待事物时，我们就会陷入非常激烈的冲突。在婚姻中，也许我们都想去自己的家庭过节。如果我只是试图说服我的丈夫，“这是为什么那是个荒谬的想法。这是为什么我应该去我的家庭。”我想我们都知道那样的对话会如何发展。如果我能对自己说，“等一下。我真的很想今年去我的家庭。也许我能理解为什么我的丈夫想去他的家庭。也许我们只需要暂停一下我们去哪个家庭。但也许我能理解我的丈夫，同时仍然理解我自己。也许那样的对话会更有成效。”你猜怎么着？确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, being able to hold two seemingly oppositional truths is also critical for any successful relationship. Meaning, my relationship with my kid, my relationship with my husband, my relationship with my colleague, people see things differently. And when we need someone else to see things the exact way we see things, we get into really intense conflict. In a marriage, maybe we both want to go to our own families for the holiday. If I'm only trying to convince my husband, here's why that's a ridiculous idea. Here's why I should go to my family. I think we all know how that conversation goes. If I can say to myself, hold on a second. I really want to go to my family this year. Maybe I can understand why my husband wants to go to his family. Maybe we just need to put on hold which family we're visiting. But maybe I can understand my husband and still understand myself. And maybe that conversation will be a lot more productive. And guess what? It is.</p>
</details>

这在育儿中也时常出现。设定界限是父母工作的重要组成部分。而且，新闻快讯，孩子们对我们设定界限通常只有一种反应：发脾气。尤其是在他们小的时候。当我对我孩子说，即使说得很优美，“我知道关掉电视很难。而且电视时间结束了。我现在要关掉了。”我从未有过一个孩子对我说：“那是个非常好的决定，妈妈。谢谢你的稳固领导。”不，尤其是在我的孩子们还小，他们还不习惯界限的时候。他们会哭。他们会发脾气。他们会说：“你是世界上最糟糕的妈妈。我所有的朋友都比我看得多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This comes into play all the time with parenting, too. Setting boundaries is a big part of a parent's job. And news flash, kids generally have one reaction to our setting boundaries, a tantrum. Especially when they're young. When I say to my kid, even beautifully, I know it's hard to turn off the TV. And TV time is over. I'm going to turn it off now. I've never had a kid say to me, "That's a really good decision, Mom. Thanks for your sturdy leadership. No, especially when my kids were younger and they weren't used to boundaries. They would cry. They would tantrum. They would say, "You're the worst mom in the world. All my friends watch more TV than I do."</p>
</details>

如果我不能把两件事都看作是真的，如果只有一件事能是真的，我就会开始对我的孩子非常生气。“你表现得太荒谬了。你已经看了一个节目了。我调查了你所有朋友的父母，他们都告诉我他们实际上比你看得少。”爆炸。如果我能把两件事都看作是真的，我会对自己说：“等一下。我的工作是设定界限。我孩子的工作实际上是感受他们的情绪，这样他们才能学会处理它们。我被允许做出关掉电视的决定。我的孩子被允许对此感到难过。我的决定不决定我孩子的情绪，我孩子的情绪绝对不决定我的决定。我可以做一个决定。我的孩子可以难过。两件事都是真的。”

My job is to set boundaries." My kid's job is actually to kind of feel their feelings so they can learn to deal with them. I'm allowed to make the decision to turn off the TV. My kid is allowed to be upset about it. My decision doesn't dictate my kid's feelings, and my kid's feelings definitely don't dictate my decision. I can make a decision. My kid can be upset.

### 边界的力量：重新定义个人权威

边界是我们需要理解的最重要的事情之一。我认为对于任何关系，无论是育儿关系、工作关系、伴侣关系，尤其是在你与姻亲的关系中，你都必须理解边界。我经常听到这样的话，对吧，在不经意间，“我婆婆不尊重我的边界。”“我儿子不尊重我的边界。”每当我听到这个短语，“某人不尊重我的边界”，说实话，我认为，“我不认为这个人对边界有正确的定义。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Boundaries are one of the most important things to understand. I think for any relationship, a parenting relationship, a work relationship, partnership, definitely in your relationship with in-laws, you have to understand boundaries. And there's something I hear all the time, right, in passing, my mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundaries. My son doesn't respect my boundaries. And whenever I hear this phrase, someone doesn't respect my boundaries. If I'm honest, what I think is, I don't think this person has a correct definition of boundaries.</p>
</details>

所以，让我分享一下我对边界的定义，然后我们将探讨为什么它如此重要，以及为什么边界实际上帮助我们与他人建立连接，而不是像我们许多人认为的那样，边界会妨碍连接。边界是我们告诉某人我们将做什么，并且它们要求对方什么都不做。所以，这就像一个两部分的清单，我喜欢这个。它非常实用。下次你认为你在设定边界时，你可以检查这两个部分。边界是我们告诉某人我们将做什么，并且它们要求对方什么都不做。好的，所以我想我设定了一个边界。我告诉某人我将做什么了吗？我的边界的成功是否要求对方什么都不做？你必须有两个“是”才能算作一个边界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let me share my definition of boundaries and then we'll go through why it's so important and why boundaries actually help us connect to other people as opposed to boundaries getting in the way of connection, which is what a lot of us think. Boundaries are what we tell someone we will do and they require the other person to do nothing. So, there's like a two-part checklist and I love this. It's very practical. The next time you think you're setting a boundary, you can check in with both parts. Boundaries are something we tell someone we will do and they require the other person to do nothing. Okay, so I think I set a boundary. Did I tell someone what I will do? And does the success of my boundary require the other person to do nothing?

所以当我对我的儿子说，对吧，这是一个很好的例子，因为我住在纽约市。我住在一个有电梯的楼里，我有一个孩子，他身上大概有0%的取悦他人的成分，对吧？所以，他不是天生取悦他人的。这对他的未来有好处。在童年时期很有挑战性，对吧？所以，如果我对我孩子说，当我们进入电梯时，“不要按所有的电梯按钮。在所有楼层都停下来很烦人，或者对其他等待的人不尊重。”然后我的儿子进去，就按了所有的按钮。很多父母会说，“我的孩子不尊重我的边界。”或者，“从沙发上下来。嘿，别在沙发上跳了。嘿，我要数到五了。”我的孩子不下来，我就说，“我的孩子不尊重我的边界。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">So when I say to my son, right, and this is a great example cuz I live in New York City. I live in an elevator building and I have a kid who has about 0% people pleasing in him, right? So, he's not inherently peopleleasing. Good for him later on. Challenging in childhood, right? And so, if I say to my kid, when we get into the elevator, don't press all the elevator buttons. It's very annoying to stop at all the floors or it's disrespectful to other people waiting. And then my son goes in and just presses all the buttons. So many parents would say, "My kid doesn't respect my boundaries." Or, "Get off the couch. Hey, stop jumping on the couch. Hey, I'm going to count to five." My kid doesn't get off and I say, "My kid doesn't respect my boundaries."</p>
</details>

好的。在这两种情况下，我告诉我的孩子我将做什么了吗？没有。我的边界的成功是否要求我的孩子什么都不做？没有。在这两种情况下，这是如此强大。我正在提出一个请求。我请求我的孩子不要按按钮。我请求我的孩子从沙发上下来。现在，请求没有错。我们一直都在提出请求。如果我们的孩子尤其不能遵循一个请求，而我们认为它真的、真的很重要，我们就必须设定一个真正的边界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. In both situations, did I tell my kid what I will do? No. Does the success of my boundary require my kid to do nothing? No. In both situations, this is so powerful. I am making a request. I'm requesting for my kid not to press the buttons. I'm requesting for my kid to get off the couch. Now, there's nothing wrong with a request. We make requests all the time. And if our kid especially isn't able to follow a request and we think it's really, really important, we have to set a true boundary.</p>
</details>

现在，注意区别。“嘿，当我们进入电梯时，我会站在你和按钮之间。宝贝，即使你扑向按钮，我也会阻止你。”然后如果你想知道我会怎么做，是的，我会准备好。当我的孩子扑过来时，我会准备好我的动作。我只会说“我不会让你那样做的。”那是一个很好的边界。不是“我们不”。这是我们都学会对我们的孩子说的一句奇怪的话。“我们不按按钮。我们不打人。”希望你的孩子知道这一点。不是“我们不”。那实际上是在放弃你所有的权威。听听这个语言。“我不会让你那样做的”，然后我会阻止我的孩子。那是一个边界。我告诉我的孩子我将做什么，我没有把我的干预的成功交到我四岁的孩子手中。那实际上把你的力量还给了你。一个真正的边界把你的力量还给你。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, watch for the difference. Hey, when we go into the elevator, I'm going to stand between you and the buttons. And sweetie, even if you lunge for the buttons, I will stop you. And then if you're wondering what I would do, yeah, I would get ready. I'd have my like move ready when my kid lunges. I would just say I'm not going to let you do that. That's a great boundary. Not we don't. It's like a weird thing we all learn to say to our kid. We don't press buttons. We don't hit. Hopefully your kid knows that. Not we don't. That's really giving away all your authority. Listen to this language. I'm not going to let you do that and then I'm going to stop my kid. That's a boundary. I'm telling my kid what I will do and I'm not putting the success of my intervention in the hands of my four-year-old. And that actually gives you back your power. A true boundary gives you your power.</p>
</details>

想想我们多少次说，“嘿，我告诉我孩子关掉电视，他没做。他不尊重我的边界。”我为什么要把我六岁的孩子赋予我的权力？然后在这样做的时候，我实际上失去了连接，因为你知道在那个电视的例子或沙发的例子中会发生什么吗？我的孩子不从沙发上下来。他们不关掉电视，我最终对他们大喊大叫，这真的减少了连接。但如果我放眼长远，我几乎可以对自己说，我为什么要为这个时刻设置自己？我甚至没有冲动控制来关掉电视。我睡得比我想的要晚。在任何情况下，我六岁的孩子怎么会看一个电视节目然后说，“你知道吗？关掉电视是个好决定。”这根本不现实。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Think about all the times we say, "H, I told my kid to turn off the TV and they didn't do it. They don't respect my boundary." Why am I giving my six-year-old my power? And then in doing that, I actually lose connection because you know what happens in that TV example or the couch example? My kid doesn't get off the couch. They don't turn off the TV and I end up yelling at them, which really diminishes connection. But if I zoom out, I can almost say to myself, why am I setting myself up for this moment? I don't even have the impulse control to turn off the TV. I go to bed later than I want to. How in any situation is my six-year-old going to watch a TV show and say, "You know what? It's a good decision to turn off the TV. It's just not realistic.</p>
</details>

那我该怎么办？下次我们看电视时，我会拿着遥控器，宝贝，在你的节目时间结束时，我会关掉电视。我的孩子不会说谢谢，但那是一个边界。而且它更有连接性，因为我为我的孩子设置了成功。我没有要求我的孩子为我做我的工作。我不是说“你能做那个对我来说很难的事情吗，因为我真的不想让你发脾气，我真的不想处理那个。所以，我要把权力交给你。”绝不。我们想把我们的权威拿回来，这是“内在良善”的一件大事。我称之为“没有攻击性的权威”。这是一种我们没有见过很多榜样的罕见的权威形式，但它是没有攻击性的权威。我是决策者。我会在我变得沮丧之前设定边界。我会在你最终做出坏行为之前设定边界。那实际上会保护我们的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what should I do? The next time we watch TV, I'm going to hold the remote, sweetie, and at the end of your showtime, I'm going to turn the TV off. My kid will not say thank you, but that is a boundary." And it's more connecting because I'm setting my kid up for success. And I'm not asking my kid to do my job for me. I'm not saying could you do the thing that's hard for me because I don't really want you to have a tantrum and I don't really want to deal with that. So, I'm going to put the power in you. No way. We want to get our authority back, which is a big thing at Good Inside. I call it authority without aggression. It's a rare form of authority we haven't seen a lot of models of, but it's authority without aggression. I'm the decision maker. I'm going to set boundaries before I get frustrated. I'm going to set boundaries before you end up doing the bad behavior. And that's actually going to preserve our relationship.</p>
</details>

另一个在工作中的例子，因为这是同样的事情。你总是准时参加一个上午9点的会议。你主持这个会议，有人总是迟到，你很烦。你可能会对他们说一些各种各样的被动攻击性的话。“如果我们明天能准时开始就好了，对吧？”然后我们认为这个人不尊重我。“请准时。”他们没来。如果你想设定一个真正的边界，你可以在会议上说，“嘿，从明天上午9点的会议开始，我只是想让大家知道，我会在9点开始会议。我不会重复事情。如果你最终迟到了，我知道我们都在尽力。有些早上就是那样。你可以会后来找我。你可以从别人那里拿笔记。我将从明天开始在9点开始会议。”就像，我希望你感到一点振奋。你会想，“哦，而不是把我的权力交给别人，我实际上在收回它，我可以用一种非常友善、有连接性的方式来做。”那实际上就是领导力，无论是在家里还是在工作场所，都是关于这个。

<p class="english-text">Another example of this at work, because it's the same thing. You're always showing up for a 9:00 a.m. meeting. You're leading this meeting and someone's always late and you're so annoyed. And you say to them maybe some various passive aggressive things. It would be nice if we could start on time tomorrow, right? And then we think this person doesn't respect me. Please be on time. They didn't come. If you want to set a true boundary, you can say at the meeting, hey, starting tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. meetings, I just want to let you all know, I will begin the meeting at 9:00. I won't end up repeating things. If you end up being late to the meeting, I know we're all trying our best. Some mornings are like that. You can come to me after. You can get notes from someone else. I will begin meetings at 9:00 starting tomorrow. Like, I hope you feel a little pep in your step. you're like, "Oh, instead of giving my power away to someone else, I'm actually reclaiming it and I can do it in a really kind, connecting way." And that's really what leadership, whether in the home or in the workplace, is all about.</p>

### 愤怒管理：从悬崖边回到安全地带

所以，当我们心烦意乱时——父母们总是问我这个问题——“当我真的心烦意乱时，我该怎么做才能冷静下来？”我记得有一次一个家长甚至对我说：“我快到极限了。我马上就要对我的孩子大喊大叫了。我知道。我不想。那一刻我该怎么办？”我常常认为这相当于有人对我说：“好吧，我开车到了一个悬崖边。我的车就在悬崖边上。我怎么才能不掉下悬崖？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, when we're flustered, and parents ask me this all the time, what do I do when I'm really flustered to like calm down? And I think a parent even once said to me, I'm on the edge. I'm about to scream at my kid. I know it. I don't want to. What do I do in that moment? I often think of this being the equivalent of someone saying to me, "All right, I drove to a cliff. My car is on the edge of the cliff. How do I not fall off the cliff?"</p>
</details>

我会对那个人说：“为什么？你为什么要开车去悬崖？”我的意思是，我们问错了问题。最好的问题是，“我如何能识别出我正行驶在一条总是通向悬崖的路上，并试图在我到达悬崖之前离开那条路？”当你在悬崖上时，你怎么才能不掉下去？我真的是这个意思。没有人对那个问题有很好的答案。我没有。我的意思是，当然，我想有一两件事我们可以做，但当我们在边缘摇摇欲坠时，我们做一些有成效的事情的能力，这是在贬低我们自己。这有点像没有为我们的孩子设置成功。我们没有为自己设置成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I would say to that person is, "Why? Why are you driving to a cliff?" Like, I mean it. We're asking the wrong question. The best question is, how can I recognize that I'm on a road that always ends on a cliff and try to like exit that road before I get to the cliff? When you're on the cliff, how do you not fall off the cliff? I really mean this. Nobody has a great answer to that. I don't. I mean, sure, I guess there's one or two things we could do, but our ability to do something productive when we're teetering on the edge, it's selling ourselves short. It's kind of like not setting our kid up for success. We're not setting oursel up for success.</p>
</details>

所以，我常常认为我们问错了问题，这实际上是我们陷入困境的原因。知道如果你对一个问题感到困惑，“我怎么才能不掉下边缘？”对自己说，“等等，也许不是我不知道这个问题的答案。也许我只需要问一个不同的问题。”这是如此赋能。而这里的问题是，“我如何开始识别我正在变得不知所措？我如何开始识别我的神经系统中正在发生什么，在我达到10分之10之前？我如何识别我正在变得过度刺激，这样我就可以在我的感官桶满之前倒掉一些，到那时任何人都会爆炸？”我喜欢这个问题，因为它更有希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So often, I think we're asking kind of the wrong questions, which is actually why we're stuck. And it's so empowering to know if you feel stuck with a question, how do I not tip off the edge? It's so empowering to say to yourself, wait, maybe it's not that I don't know the answer to this question. Maybe I just need to ask a different question. And the question here is, how do I start recognizing that I'm getting overwhelmed? How do I start recognizing what's happening in my nervous system before I'm at a 10 out of 10? How do I recognize I'm getting overstimulated so I can kind of empty some of that sensory bucket before I get to the point that I'm full, at which point anybody would explode? And I love this question because it's much more hopeful.</p>
</details>

第一，我们必须意识到愤怒是一种健康的情绪。我不仅仅是说一种正常的情绪。它是一种健康的情绪。愤怒告诉我们我们想要什么和我们需要什么。我实际上不希望任何人失去愤怒。如果我们想保留任何自尊和自我价值感，我们必须能够接触到愤怒。你能想象有人说，“我从不生气。”那实际上是在说，“我从不知道我想要什么。我从不知道我需要什么。”那实际上是一种非常、非常可悲的存在状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one is we have to realize anger is a healthy emotion. I don't just mean a normal emotion. It's a healthy emotion. Anger tells us what we want and what we need. I actually wouldn't wish the removal of anger on anyone. If we want to preserve any sense of self-esteem and selfworth, we have to have access to anger. Can you imagine someone saying, "I'm never angry." That's really a way of saying, "I never know what I want. I never know what I need." That's actually a really, really sad state of being.</p>
</details>

实际上，能够接触到愤怒意味着你仍然能够接触到自我价值感，相信你确实应该想要和需要东西。现在，为什么愤怒如此难以管理？这要追溯到依恋和内在家庭系统以及我们最早的几年。愤怒是最难发展技能的情绪之一，因为它如此强大。但问题不在于愤怒本身。问题在于我们大多数人没有被教导有效管理愤怒的技能，我们没有被给予足够长的跑道来学习如何做到这一点。相反，我们被送到我们的房间，这讽刺地只会让我们在没有技能的情况下更生气。相当适得其反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually, having access to anger means you still have access to selfworth. the belief that you do kind of deserve to want and need things. Now, why is anger so hard to manage? It goes back to attachment and internal family systems and our earliest years. Anger is one of the hardest emotions to develop skills for because it's so powerful. But the issue wasn't anger itself. The issue was most of us weren't taught skills to effectively manage anger and we weren't given a long enough kind of runway to learn how to do that. Instead, we were like sent to our rooms, which ironically only makes us more angry without having skills. Pretty counterproductive.</p>
</details>

在成年后，修复的一个重要部分——这是我最喜欢与父母做的工作之一，也许可以在这里做一个小小的预览——是开始重新获得接触健康愤怒的能力。这里有一个例子，大多数人不会把它看作是愤怒。好的，我在洗澡时间感到非常不知所措。假设，假设我是一个全职父母，或者我回家早，我的伴侣每晚都工作。我想，希望我能有更多的帮助。希望我能有更多的帮助。对吧？你感到有点生气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In adulthood, a big part of reparing, and this is some of my favorite work to do with parents, can do maybe a little preview of it here, is to start to reclaim access to healthy anger. Here's an example, and most people wouldn't think about it as anger. Okay, I'm really overwhelmed at bath time. Let's say, let's say I'm a stay at home parent or I'm home earlier and my partner works every night. I think wish I had more help. Wish I had more help. Right? You feel a little angry.</p>
</details>

如果你能够识别愤怒，“嗨，愤怒。嗯，这很合理。愤怒告诉我我想要什么和需要什么。我想要什么？我想要一些帮助。我需要一些支持。好的，我允许自己感到愤怒。”然后也许因为我做了那个过程，我能够——这需要练习和技能，我喜欢教父母——直接说，而不是这样。这是我们太常做的事情。“如果你某个时候能在家洗澡就好了。”不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're able to recognize anger, hi, anger. Well, that makes sense. Anger tells me what I want and need. What do I want? I want some help. I need some support. Okay, I'm allowing myself to feel anger. And maybe then because I've done that process, I'm able to, and this takes practice and skills, which I love to teach parents, speak directly, not this. This is what we do too often. It would be nice if you were home for a bath time some point. No.</p>
</details>

“嘿，我一个人给孩子洗澡时感到不知所措，我真的、真的需要更多的支持。你能告诉我这周哪两个晚上你可以在下午5点25分之前回家吗？我是认真的。”我从一种感觉开始。我指出了一个需求，并且我很具体。我总是有一个小小的缩写词，感觉、需求、具体。具体性很重要，因为很多时候，尤其是在育儿中，当你是信息的持有者时，你说洗澡时间，那个因为某种原因参与较少的人可能完全不知道你的意思。他们会说：“我7点回家的。哦，我不知道洗澡时间是5点半。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, I feel overwhelmed around doing bath time by myself, and I really, really need more support. Can you let me know two nights this week that you can be home by 5:25 p.m.? I really mean it. I start with a feeling. I name a need and I am specific. I always just have this little acronym, feeling, need, specific. The specificity matters because so often, especially in parenting, when you're the holder of information, you say bath time, the person who's less involved for whatever reason might have no idea what you mean. They're like, I came home at 7:00. Oh, I didn't know that bath time was at 5:30.</p>
</details>

这对我们很多人来说都很难，因为我们被如此地条件化，试图尽可能地远离愤怒，以至于我们不直接沟通。我们有点绕圈子，我们做一些极其无力的事情。我们希望别人在我们自己认识到我们的需求之前认识到它。就像我们几乎在交叉手指。“我希望我的伴侣知道我5点25分需要帮助。”我们做一些我称之为“暗示和希望”的事情。“哦，我只是要暗示一下，然后我希望。”如此无力。意识到，“等等，愤怒是健康的。它告诉我我需要什么。我需要什么？我能听它说吗？我能说出一种感觉吗？对吧？我可能需要帮助。那是我的愤怒告诉我的，对吧？洗澡时间，最低限度是每周两个晚上5点25分。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is hard for a lot of us because we have been so conditioned to try to get as far away from anger as possible that we don't communicate directly. We kind of dance around it and we do something extremely powerless. We hope someone else recognizes our need before we do. Like we're almost crossing our fingers. I hope my partner knows I need help at 525. We do something I call we hint and hope. Oh, I'm just going to drop a hint and I'm going to hope. So disempowering. So amazing to realize, wait, anger is healthy. It's telling me what I need. What do I need? Can I listen to it? Can I name a feeling? Right? I probably need help. That's what my anger's telling me, right? With bath time and the minimum is two nights a week at 5:25.</p>
</details>

现在，我正在做的——我总是和父母们谈论这个——如果我想到一条通往愤怒的道路，也就是我们所说的掉下悬崖，我不是等到我几乎在悬崖边上，我是在退出。我真的在走一个出口。另一个例子可能是，“哦，我被触摸得太多了。我甚至无法忍受我的孩子们在我身边。”等等，也许那在某种程度上是一个愤怒的信号。我需要什么？我需要一些独处的时间。嗯？每当我告诉我的孩子们我要去散步，也许我的伴侣在家，或者我有一些帮助，或者他们足够大可以独自在家，他们说：“等等，我想和你一起去。”现在我意识到，“不，宝贝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what I'm doing, and I always talk about this with parents, kind of if I think about a road to rage, which is what we mean when we fall off the cliff, is instead of waiting till I'm almost at the cliff, I'm exiting. I'm I'm literally taking an exit. Another example might be, "Oh, I'm so touched out. I can't even deal with my kids anywhere near me." Wait, maybe that's an anger signal in a way. What do I need? I need some time alone. Huh? Whenever I tell my kids I'm going to go for a walk, maybe my partner's home or I have some help or they're old enough to stay home alone and they say, "Wait, I want to go with you." Now I realize, "No, sweetie.</p>
</details>

我真的很爱做你的父母，和你在一起。我想非常直接。我也真的需要自己的时间。那真的很重要。所以，你难过没关系。我要在接下来的20分钟里完全自己去散步。那是我需要的东西。”那是那条路上的另一个出口，讽刺的是，它来自于你识别愤怒的能力。你对你的孩子们感到有点生气，怨恨，你实际上可以利用那个信息再次退出那条路，在我们到达悬崖之前。

You're feeling a little angry at your kids, resentful, and you can actually use that information to exit that road again before we're on the cliff.</p>

### AVP练习：情绪调节的基础

我实际上认为你能做的最简单的事情是采纳这个AVP练习。AVP是一个基础的情绪调节技能。只是为了过一遍这些步骤，它们是承认（Acknowledge）、验证（Validate）、允许（Permit）。如果我不能说，“我想我感到焦虑。哦，那是嫉妒的感觉。”我就无法调节我的焦虑或嫉妒的感觉。我总是认为承认就像对某事说“嗨”。我发现这真的、真的很有用，因为一旦我能对嫉妒说“嗨”，那么嫉妒就是我的一部分，而不是我的全部。好的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually think the simplest thing you can do is adopt this AVP practice. AP is a basic foundational emotion regulation skill. And just to go through those steps, it's acknowledge, validate, permit. I'm not going to be able to regulate my feelings of anxiety or jealousy if I'm not able to say, "I think I'm feeling anxious. Oh, there's that jealous feeling." I always think of acknowledgement as saying hi to something. And I find this really, really useful because as soon as I can say hi to jealousy, then jealousy is a part of me and not all of me. Okay?</p>
</details>

所以，一旦我能说，“哇，嗨，嫉妒的感觉，关于我的朋友升职了，而我在工作上有点挣扎。”现在，而不是嫉妒有点像在我的车的驾驶座上，它只是感觉像是接管了。那是我们做出非常糟糕的决定的时候。我在我的车的驾驶座上。我有点像在后座上对嫉妒挥手。它有点像一个烦人的、讨厌的乘客，但我承认它。然后我认为我们有验证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as soon as I can say, "Whoa, hi, jealous feeling about my friend getting a promotion when I'm kind of struggling at work." Now, instead of jealousy kind of being in the driver's seat of my car, it just feels like it's taken over. That's when we make really bad decisions. I'm in the driver's seat of my car. I'm kind of like waving to jealousy in the back seat. It's kind of like an annoying, pesky passenger, but I'm acknowledging it. And then I think we have validation.</p>
</details>

验证是告诉你自己为什么你的感觉是合理的。这与说你关于感觉的行为是合理的没有任何关系。你感到嫉妒可能是完全合理的。那不意味着你应该给你的朋友发一条恶毒的短信，关于那个得到好工作晋升的朋友。那是不对的。但你必须能够对自己说，“嗯，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Validation is telling yourself why your feeling makes sense. That doesn't have anything to do with saying your behavior about the feeling makes sense. It might make perfect sense that you're feeling jealous. That doesn't mean you should send a nasty text message to your friends about your friend who got the good job promotion. Not okay. But you have to be able to say to yourself, "Well,</p>
</details>

我一直在工作上非常努力，我没有得到我以为我会得到的晋升。所以，我嫉妒是合理的。”验证不意味着我同意你的感觉。当我对我孩子说，“我懂了。你希望你能晚点睡。”我没有一部分认为他们晚点睡是个好主意。他们有就寝时间，因为我认为那是正确的就寝时间。但验证是如此重要，因为它有点像在对别人说，“我看到你的情绪对你来说是真实的，”这实际上对我来说没什么损失。我不是说它对我来说是真实的。我甚至不是说如果我在你的位置上我会那样感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been really working hard at work and I haven't gotten the promotion I thought I was going to get. So, it makes sense that I'm jealous." Validation does not mean I agree with how you feel. When I say to my kid, I get it. You wish you could stay up later. No part of me thinks it's a good idea for them to stay up later. They have a bedtime because I think it's the right bedtime. But validation is so important because it's kind of saying to someone else, I see your emotions as real for you, which is really no SKIN OFF MY BACK. I'm not saying it's real for me. I'm not even saying I would feel like that if I were in your position.</p>
</details>

很有趣。我们不能验证别人的唯一原因是因为我们处于“只有一件事是真的”的心态中。我们只在想，“嗯，我不那样感觉。嗯，我不会那样感觉。嗯，我在那个年龄时没有那样感觉。”那可能都是真的。但我们必须持有“两件事都是真的”。我不那样感觉。我不会那样感觉。我的孩子正在那样感觉。在我们的核心，作为人类，我们都只是在寻找被相信的感觉。那之所以如此重要，是因为我们的感觉既如此强大又完全不可见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's interesting. The only reason we can't validate someone else is because we are in a one thing is true mentality. We are only thinking, well, I don't feel that way. Well, I wouldn't feel that way. Well, I didn't feel that way when I was that age. That could all be true. But we have to hold two things are true. I don't feel that way. I wouldn't have felt that way. My child is feeling that way. At our core, as humans, we are all just looking to feel believed. And the reason that's so important is because our feelings are both so powerful and completely invisible.</p>
</details>

你看，当一个孩子摔倒，膝盖擦破，流血，他们在痛苦中哭泣时，看到血或伤口是非常有用的。他们会想，“我以为那很痛。哦，看那个。是真的血。我是对的。”感觉是如此令人困惑，因为每个成年人都知道，当你强烈地感觉到某事时，它只是你身体里一种如此强大的感觉。但没有血来证明它。没有血液测试。没有任何外部的东西是你的感觉是真实的标志。所以作为人类，当有人看到一个正在接管我们身体的不可见的感觉是真实的，那就像是最终的松了一口气。就像“我毕竟没那么疯狂。我感觉到的这个东西是真实的。是的，这是一个真实的东西。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">See, when a kid falls and skins their knee and is bleeding and they're crying in pain, there's something very useful about seeing the blood or the cut. They're like, "I thought that was painful. Oh, look at that. It's real blood. I'm right." Feelings are so confusing because every adult knows when you feel something intensely, it is just such a powerful sensation in your body. But there's no blood to prove it. There's no blood test. There's nothing external that is a sign that what you're feeling is real. And so as humans, when someone sees an invisible feeling that's taking over our body as real, it's like the ultimate sigh of relief. It's like I'm not so crazy after all. This thing that I feel is real. Yeah, this is a real thing.</p>
</details>

现在，验证也是我们想为我们的孩子做的事情的原因，知道那不意味着我们同意，是我们的孩子如果他们没有得到“感觉是真实的”的信息，就无法学会管理他们身体里的感觉。那是一个先决条件。所以，人们对我说，“但我不想让我的孩子认为像这样为上床睡觉而抓狂是可以的，所以我不会验证那种感觉。”我说，“哇，让我们从长远来看。”讽刺的是，如果你希望你的孩子长大后不会为上床睡觉而抓狂，你实际上确实想要验证他们的感觉。那是第一步。“不做你自己的决定很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason validation also is something we want to do for our kids, knowing that it doesn't mean we agree, is our kids can't learn to manage a feeling in their body if they don't get the message that the feeling is real. That's a precondition. So, people say to me, "But I don't want my kid to think it's just okay to freak out like this about going to bed, so I'm not going to validate the feeling." I said, "Whoa, let's take the long game here." Ironically, if you want your kid when they're older to not freak out about going to bed, you actually do want to validate their feelings. That's step one. It's hard not to make your own decision.</p>

让别人选择你的就寝时间很糟糕。甚至只是‘你现在必须上床睡觉，你真的很不高兴。我相信你。’”现在，同样的事情也适用于成年后的自我调节。验证你自己的感觉不意味着这个感觉会永远是真的。它不意味着这个感觉意味着你必须以某种方式行事。它只是有点像在对你身体里的感觉说，“你是真实的。我相信你。”我向你保证，那对降低强度所做的，是显著的。你几乎可以把你的感觉想象成这个烦人的朋友，他只是想引起你的注意，你就像，“别这样。别这样。走开。我希望这个朋友不在这个派对上。”你只需要有时候看着那个朋友说，“嗨，我看到你了。你是真实的。”然后那个朋友就会稍微冷静下来，不会那么讨厌了。

<p class="english-text">It stinks to have someone else pick your bedtime. Even just you're really upset that you have to go to bed right now. I believe you. Now, the same thing is true for self-regulation in adulthood. Validating your own feelings doesn't mean this feeling is going to be true forever. It doesn't mean this feeling means you have to act in a certain way. It's just kind of a way of saying to the sensations in your body, you're real. I believe you. And I promise you what that does to kind of cool down the intensity is remarkable. You can almost think about your feelings like this annoying friend who's just trying to get your attention and you're like, "Stop it. Stop it. Go away. I wish this friend wasn't at this party." You just kind of have to look at the friend sometimes and say, "Hi, I see you. You're real." And then that friend will like simmer down a little bit and won't be as pesky.</p>
</details>

所以，总的来说，验证不意味着同意。验证不意味着我感觉一样。验证只是一种说一种感觉对那个人来说是真实的方式。当你那样想的时候，开始做可能会容易得多。我认为缺少的下一件事是我称之为“允许”（permission），也就是给自己允许有那种感觉。这实际上是显著的。有时候我认为我们的感觉会对我们说，“请就让我们在那里。请就让我们活在你的身体里。我们不要求更多了。”一旦我能对自己说，“我允许自己感到嫉妒。我允许这种嫉妒的感觉。”它也就不会对我们有那么大的控制力了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, big picture, validation doesn't mean agreeing. Validation doesn't mean I feel the same way. Validation is just a way of saying a feeling is real for that person. And when you think about it that way, it might be a lot easier to start doing. The next thing that I think is missing is what I call permission, which is just giving yourself permission to have the feeling. It's actually remarkable. Sometimes I think our feelings would be saying to us, "Please just allow us to be there. Please just allow us to live in your body. We're not looking for much more." As soon as I can say to myself, I allow myself to feel jealous. I permit this jealous feeling. It also doesn't have as much of a hold on us.</p>
</details>

我经常被问到，所有这些对我孩子情绪的验证，我是在溺爱他们吗？我喜欢这个问题，因为我真的、真的想区分这两者。溺爱是真实存在的。让我说清楚。有很多父母，我也看到了，存在溺爱。那真正意味着的是，你在限制你孩子的能力。内在良善是关于帮助你的孩子接触并发挥他们的能力。我相信那对孩子是最好的。那就是韧性。验证你孩子正在感受的任何东西，是帮助你的孩子变得有能力的一部分，但它不是全部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm asked a lot, all this validation of my kids feelings, am I just coddling them? And I love this question because I really really want to differentiate the two. Codling is a real thing. Let me be clear. There are a lot of parents, I see it, too, where there's cuddling. And what that really means is you are limiting your kid's capability. Good inside is all about helping your kid access and bring out their capability. I believe that's the best thing for kids. That's what resilience is. And validation of whatever your kid is feeling is a part of helping your kid be capable, but it's not the whole thing.</p>
</details>

我认为有两件事对于帮助一个孩子变得更有能力非常重要。第一件是那种“我相信你”。我们听到别人谈论这个。所以，假设一个孩子在一个足球队，但他们不再是首发了，他们发现了这一点。他们明天不想去训练了。对我来说，第一个“我相信你”，验证，听起来会是这样的：“看，我懂了。我可能也会有同样的感觉。就像我只想待在我的房间里。我不敢相信我失去了我的首发位置。那太糟了。”如果我对我的孩子那样说，然后我说，“我猜你不用去了。”是的。我认为那对一个孩子来说真的很有局限性。真的很有局限性。那不仅仅是溺爱。我只是认为那是一件非常可悲的事情，当一个孩子因为他们的情绪而觉得自己没有能力做某事时，我们与那个不那么有能力的版本的他们串通一气。我认为那最终对一个孩子来说是一种可怕的感觉。“哦，我没想到我有能力做一件难事。而且也没有别人真的相信我。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think about two things that are really important components of helping a kid become more capable. And the first one is kind of that I believe you. And and we hear other people talk about this. So let's say a kid is on a soccer team, but they're no longer starting and they found that out. They don't want to go to practice tomorrow. To me, the first I believe you, the validation would sound something like this. Look, I get it. I would probably feel the same way. Like I just kind of want to stay in my room. I can't believe I lost my starting spot. That stinks. If I say that to my kid and then I say, "I guess you don't have to go." Yeah. I I think that's really limiting to a kid. Really limiting. It's not just coddling. I I just think it's a very sad thing that when a kid feels that they're not capable of something because of their emotions, we collude in that not so capable version of themselves. I think that ends up being a horrible feeling to a kid. Oh, I didn't think I was capable of doing something hard. And no one else really believed in me either.</p>
</details>

现在，溺爱的反面，我猜，会是这样的：“你小题大做。去训练。这太荒谬了。”很有趣。我不认为那有助于培养一个孩子的韧性。现在，突然之间，我的孩子真的不想去训练了，因为那只是反抗我的一种方式。所以，那是适得其反的。我的孩子在他们长大后的生活中会在无数个点上感到失望。如果他们不能做承认、验证和允许他们感觉的第一步，他们就无法从中恢复。仅仅因为你的感觉而评判自己，会让它们更难处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the opposite of coddling, I guess, would be something like, "You're making a big deal out of nothing. Go to practice. This is absurd." It's interesting. I I don't think that helps bring out a kid's resilience either. Now, all of a sudden, my kid really doesn't want to go to practice because it's just a way to defy me. So, that's counterproductive. My kids's going to feel let down at a million points in their life when they're older. And if they can't do that first step of acknowledging and validating and permitting their feelings, they're not going to be able to recover from it. And just judging yourself for your feelings makes them harder to deal with.</p>
</details>

那么中间地带是什么？那个韧性建设地带是什么？我们有这个“我相信你”。但第二部分，我确实认为这有时是缺失的，但让我告诉你，这是我们在“内在良善”所做的核心。我们从不忘记它。“我相信你，我相信你（的能力）。”这实际上很容易记住。“我相信你，我相信你（的能力）。”你想培养一个有韧性的孩子，尤其是在面对一些紧张或焦虑的感觉时。你需要两个部分。好的？在某种程度上，我把我的孩子们想象成几乎在一个洞里。不是像一个深渊，但假设它像一个小洞，“我做不到这个。不。”我需要一只脚和他们一起在洞里。就像那是验证的部分。“我相信你。我和你在一起。”但这很重要。你需要一只脚在洞外。我总是那样想。一只脚在验证，一只脚在能力和希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what's that middle ground? What's that resilience building ground? We have this I believe you. But the second part, and I do think this is missing sometimes, but let me tell you, it is core to what we do at Good Inside. We never forget it. I believe you and I believe in you. It's actually really easy to remember that. I believe you and I believe in you. You want to raise a resilient kid, especially in the face of some nervous or anxious feelings. You need both parts. Okay? And in a way, I picture my kids kind of in a hole almost. Not like a abyss, but let's say it's like a little hole like I can't do this. No, I kind of need one foot in the hole with them. Like that's the part that's validating. I believe you. I'm with you. But this is important. You need one foot out of the hole. I always think about it. One foot in validation, one foot in capability and hope.</p>
</details>

那听起来会是什么样？我们开始了。“看，我懂了。我感觉一样。老实说，不再有首发位置，那真的很难。而且我，也，可能只想蜷缩在我的床上，不去训练。而且，你是一个能做难事的孩子。我想让你从我这里听到那个。你是。而且去训练，真的不舒服，有点尴尬。我不会告诉你你能摆脱那个。那将会是一个非常、非常艰难的训练。而且你实际上会从经历那个中得到更多，比你可能只是在高中剩下的时间里拥有首发位置得到的更多。我想说实话，我真的知道你能做到这个。”那不是溺爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what would that sound like? We started. Look, I get it. I feel the same way. Honestly, not having a starting spot anymore, that's really hard. And I, too, would probably just want to curl up in my bed and not go to practice. And you're a kid who can do hard things. I want you to hear that from me. You are. and showing up to practice really uncomfortable and a little bit embarrassed. I'm not going to tell you you can work your way out of that. It is going to be a really, really hard practice. And you're actually going to get more out of going through that than you probably would if you were just having the starting position for the rest of high school. I want to be honest and I really know you can do this. That's not coddling.</p>
</details>

现在，父母们会变得非常具体。“所以，你让他们去训练吗？”一个家庭里有很多动态。没有父母通常能那么成功地让他们16岁的孩子做任何事。但这也与你直到那时与他们相处的方式有关，以及你是否与他们建立了足够的我称之为“连接资本”，让那个干预真正有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, parents get very specific. So, do you make them go to practice? There's so many dynamics in a family. No parent is usually that successful making their like 16-year-old do anything. But this also has to do with the way you've related to them until that point and whether you kind of have enough of what I call connection capital built up with them for that intervention to really be helpful.</p>
</details>

我给你另一个例子，对吧？你的孩子在班上和任何他们是朋友的人都不在一起。“你必须给学校打电话。你必须把我换到和莫莉和普里亚在一起，无论他们的朋友叫什么名字。”“看，宝贝。我记得我像你这么大的时候，我发现我一年级时和我的好朋友们不在一个班。那太糟了。那不只是这样或这样糟。那是大大的糟。而且，你是一个会度过这个难关的孩子。我不会给学校打电话。有时候我们就是和我们的朋友不在一个班。而且实际上，你在今年年底会感觉更自信，因为你度过了那个。可能交了一些新朋友。但无论如何，只是看到你能度过失望。所以，我不会给学校打电话。我不会换你的班，但我会每天提醒你你有多能干。而且我也会理解你很难过，我们会一起度过这个。”那是韧性建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll give you another example, right? Your kid isn't in class with anyone they're friends with. You have to call the school. You have to switch me so I'm with Molly and Priya, whatever their friends names are. Look, sweetie. I remember when I was your age and I found out I wasn't in first grade with my best friends. That stinks. That doesn't just stink like this or this. It's like big time. And you're a kid who's going to get through this. I'm not going to call the school. Sometimes we don't get our friends in our class. And actually, you're going to feel more confident at the end of this year having gotten through that. Probably having made some new friends. But either way, just seeing that you can get through disappointment. So, I'm not going to call the school. I'm not going to switch your class, but I will remind you every day how capable you are. And I'll also understand that you're sad and we're going to get through this together. That is resilience building.</p>
</details>

因为当你长大后，有些事真的很难，你必须做第一步。“这太糟了。我被解雇了。”然后如果你也听到第二个声音，“我会度过这个的。我感到被悲伤和羞耻所淹没，但我也知道有另一个版本的我，会到达另一边。我现在甚至不能真正看到她，但我知道她在那里。”这两者的结合。哦，堪称完美。那就是韧性。

<p class="english-text">Because when you get older and something's really hard, you have to do that first step. This stinks. I got fired from my job. And then if you also hear that second voice and I'm going to get through this. I feel overwhelmed with kind of sadness and shame, but I also know there's some other version of me who's going to get to the other side. I can't even really see her right now, but I know she's there. That combination of those two. Oo, chef's kiss. That's resilience.</p>

### 屏幕时代下的挫折容忍力

我思考了很多关于屏幕——无论是我们作为父母与屏幕的关系，还是我们的孩子与屏幕的关系——如何影响情绪调节。我认为我思考的核心是，我们与挫折的关系正在因为屏幕随时随地提供的便利和坦率地说，快速的多巴胺冲击而戏剧性地、迅速地改变。所以，让我们从孩子开始，但我会谈谈父母，因为我认为那是谈话中经常被忽略的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think a lot about how screens, both our relationship with screens as parents and our kids' relationships with screens are affecting emotion regulation. I think the core thing I think about is our relationship with frustration is dramatically changing so quickly because of the ease and frankly the quick dopamine hits that screens give us all the time. So, let's start with children, but then I'll talk about parents because I think that's the part that's often left out of the conversation.</p>
</details>

我们的孩子，因为技术，他们的日常生活中内置了更多的便利。无论是“我只要坐在iPad上，基本上就这样，叮叮叮叮叮，基本上什么都不用做，多巴胺和享受和兴奋和奖励就向我涌来。”这有点像我们希望孩子们建立的所有电路的反面，就以后会有适应性而言。就像甚至想想你五岁的孩子学习阅读，或者在他们的第一份工作中承担一个困难的项目。你希望他们有一个电路，有点像说“我必须付出很多努力和很多工作。顺便说一下，很多时间，很多挣扎，很多意向性，然后未来的某一天我会有回报。”回报是在很多努力工作之后才来的，基本上是“我基本上不做任何努力工作，马上就得到回报”的反面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our kids, because of technology, there's just a lot more ease built into their everyday life. Whether it's I just get to sit on an iPad and basically go like this, bing bing bing bing bing, basically nothing, effortless, and dopamine and enjoyment and excitement and reward just come to me. It's kind of the opposite of all the circuitry we would want kids to build in terms of what will be adaptive later on. Like even think about your kid at five learning to read or in their first job taking on a hard project. You want them to have a circuit that kind of says I have to put in a lot of effort and a lot of work. By the way, a lot of time, a lot of struggle, a lot of intentionality and then one day in the future I will have a reward. reward comes later after a lot of hard work is basically the opposite of I do basically no hard work and get reward right away.</p>
</details>

所以，我们的孩子有更少的我称之为“挫折容忍力”是有道理的。对挫折的容忍度更低，这基本上是想要和拥有之间的空间，因为对孩子和技术来说，想要和拥有之间的空间已经被压缩了。我常常甚至只是想到看一部电影。我很幸运地在一个有Blockbuster会员资格的家庭长大。好的，所以我想，“哦，我真的很想看一部电影。好的，让我去和我父母谈谈，看看他们什么时候能带我去Blockbuster。”好的，也许那是一两天。现在，让我们开车去Blockbuster。这已经是48小时了，我像是，“哦，我真的很想看这部电影。真的很想看《风骚俏佳人》（Troop Beverly Hills），无论是什么。”我们终于到了Blockbuster。进去，你在过道里蜿蜒前行，然后你看到那个图像，有时候像我们大多数人记得的那样，你你往后看，你像是，“哦天哪，他们卖完了。他们甚至没有那部电影。”或者也许他们有，但在想要和想象和拥有之间花了很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it makes sense that our kids have less what I call frustration tolerance. There is less tolerance for frustration which is essentially the space between wanting and having because the space between wanting and having for children and technology has been collapsed. I often think even just about watching a movie I was fortunate to grow up in a family where he had a Blockbuster membership. Okay, so I think about, oh, I really want to watch a movie. Okay, let me go talk to my parents and see when they can take me to Blockbuster. Okay, maybe that's a day or two. Now, let's go on the drive to Blockbuster. This is already 48 hours where I'm like, "Oh, I really want to watch this movie. Really want to watch Troop Beverly Hills, whatever it is." We finally get to Blockbuster. go and you're winding through the aisles and then you see the image and sometimes as most of us remember is you you look behind and you're like, "Oh man, they're out. They don't even have that movie." Or maybe they do, but it took such a long time between wanting and imagining and having.</p>
</details>

如果我们想想一个孩子现在想要看一个节目和拥有一个节目之间的时间，我我它基本上没有时间。它几乎像魔法一样。就像，如果我想要什么，它就在那一刻神奇地出现在我面前。我认为我们太常不思考这在学校里会如何表现？这在一个孩子学习阅读的能力上会如何表现？现在，阅读周围肯定有学习动态，对吧？有语音学。当然，有些孩子是阅读障碍或有注意力困难。但对于很多挣扎的孩子来说，这是他们五岁左右的第一件事之一，他们实际上必须等待和努力，并且不能马上成功。你知道吗？对于阅读，没有人只是马上就把阅读能力交给你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we think about the time a child right now has between wanting to watch a show and having a show, I I it's essentially no time. It's almost like magic. Like, if I want something, it magically appears in front of me in that moment. And I think too often we're not thinking about how does this show up in school? How does this show up in a kid's ability to learn to read? Now, there's definitely learning dynamics around reading, right? There's phonics. Certainly, some kids are dyslexic or have attention struggles. But for a lot of kids who struggle, it's one of the first things around age five that they actually have to wait and work and not succeed at right away. And you know what? With reading, nobody is just delivering to you right away the ability to read.</p>
</details>

所以如果一个孩子身体里的那个电路——工作，尝试，坚持。得不到。继续尝试。听到那个说，“我做不到”的声音。深呼吸。休息一下。回来。继续。最好的结果是，我不知道，你能读一个单词的一部分，但在那节课结束时甚至不能读整个单词。如果那个电路在一个孩子生命的其他部分没有被发展，到他们学习阅读的时候，难怪那个孩子看起来像是基本上在崩溃，不能专注于它，因为它是一个全新的任务，并且与他们5岁生活中期望的所有奖励电路完全不符。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if that circuit in a kid's body work, try stick with it. Don't get it. Keep trying. Hear that voice that says, "I can't do it." Take a deep breath. Take a break. Come back. Keep going. And the best it gets is, I don't know, you can read a part of a word, but not even the whole word at the end of that lesson. If that circuit has not been developed in other parts of a kid's life by the time they learn to read, it's no wonder the kid looks like they're essentially having a meltdown and can't attend to it because it is a totally new task and completely at odds with all the reward circuitry they've come to expect in their 5-year-old life.</p>
</details>

好的。现在，我认为我们经常忽略并且如此重要的部分是，我们与屏幕在成年后的关系在育儿周围的动态方面做了什么。所以，我们有点知道我们的孩子对挫折的容忍度更低，这实际上确实意味着他们可能有更多的坏行为，因为他们的期望与我们的期望如此不同。但现在在成年后，我知道，我只能说我自己，我经常用我的手机。我已经习惯了这个世界，我不用去Blockbuster。我想看一部电影。我就要看那部电影。我甚至想到我今晚的饭菜可能想要的一种配料。我可以去叮叮叮，那个东西就送到我家了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Now, the part that I think we often neglect and is so important is what our relationship with screens in adulthood has done in terms of the dynamics around parenting. So, we kind of know our kids are less tolerant of frustration, which actually does mean they probably do have more bad behavior because their expectations are so different than ours were. But now in adulthood, I know, and I can just speak for myself, I'm on my phone a lot. I've gotten used to this world where I don't have to go to Blockbuster. I want to watch a movie. I'm going to watch that movie. I even think about an ingredient I might want to have for tonight's meal. I can go bing bing bing and the thing is delivered to my house.</p>
</details>

如此多的便利，如此多的即时满足，如此多的多巴胺，如此少的挫折，如此多的方便，如此少的不便在我们的成年生活中。我认为关于抚养年幼孩子最重要的事情之一是，实际上当它做得好时，它是非常不方便的。你的孩子会在你去杂货店时发脾气，你就像，“嗯，我猜我买不到杂货了。我要把我孩子抱起来，带他们出去。你是个正在经历困难的好孩子。无论我说什么，把他们放在车里。解决它。”如此不方便。我下班回家10分钟，我的孩子在尖叫。我懂了。不方便。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So much more ease, so much more immediate gratification, so much more dopamine, so much less frustration, so much convenience, and so much less inconvenience in our adult life. I think one of the most important things to know about raising young kids is actually that it's massively inconvenient when it's done well. Your kid will have a tantrum when you go to the grocery store and you're like, "Well, I guess I'm not getting groceries. I'm going to have to pick my kid up and carry them out. You're a good kid having a hard time. Whatever I say, put them in the car. Work through it." So inconvenient. I'm home for 10 minutes after work and my kid is screaming. I get it. Inconvenient.</p>
</details>

如果你想想手机对我们容忍育儿日常不便的能力做了什么，那是戏剧性的。我认为我们之所以会陷入这个坏循环的原因之一是，我们的孩子对挫折的容忍度更低，部分原因是技术和他们对太多即时满足的期望，更多的坏行为。我们对我们孩子的坏行为的容忍度更低，因为我们与我们的屏幕的关系，这意味着而不是容忍它，“哦，我们要一起解决这个”，我们是像，“好吧，拿个iPad。好吧，吃冰淇淋。好吧，让我改变我的规则。我只是想让这个消失。”我们在这个可怕的循环中。我们容忍度更低，他们容忍度更低，更多的坏行为，更多的关闭和回避，更多的坏行为，走向一个坏的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you think about what phones have done to our tolerance of the day-to-day inconveniences of parenting, it's dramatic. I think one of the reasons we kind of can get into this bad cycle, our kids are less tolerant of frustration in part because of technology and their expectations of too much immediate gratification, more bad behavior. We are less tolerant of our kids' bad behavior because of our relationship with our screams, which means instead of tolerating it, oh, we're going to work through this together, where it's like, fine, take an iPad. Fine, have the ice cream. Fine, let me change my rule. I just want to make this go away. And we're in this horrible cycle. We're less tolerant, they're less tolerant, more bad behavior, more shutting down and avoidance, more bad behavior, off in a bad direction.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么帮助成人和孩子增加我称之为“挫折容忍力”的原因之一——我关于挫折容忍力的工作，它与韧性是手拉手的。在这个时代，没有什么比教你的孩子挫折容忍力更重要了，这也意味着我们必须增加我们自己的挫折容忍力来帮助我们的孩子做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's one of the reasons why helping adults and kids increase what I call frustration tolerance, like my work around frustration tolerance, it's handinhand with resilience. There is nothing more important in this day and age than teaching your kid frustration tolerance, which also means we have to increase our own frustration tolerance to help our kids do the same.</p>
</details>

当我们想到我们的孩子坏行为时，比如“我的孩子不等待，他们总是打断我。”嗯，我们的孩子的生活中内置的等待更少了。他们确实如此。他们不等待一部电影。他们看五分钟的电影，也许只是一个节目，他们就像，“不，不喜欢这个。下一个，下一个，下一个，下一个。”所以，我们实际上必须确保和我们的孩子一起，就像我实际上对我孩子说过，“我要教你等待。它是一件事。它是一件事。它仍然是真实的。我要确保我们学会它。”这是这些原因之一，在边缘上，对吧？我住在曼哈顿，我可能会想，“哦，我要跳上一辆出租车。”你知道吗？我要留出更多的时间，我要去等公共汽车。不仅仅是因为它省钱，我喜欢，而是因为我的孩子实际上比我小时候需要更多的时刻来等待，来真正学习如何等待和练习这样做。

<p class="english-text">When we think about our kid bad behavior, like my kid doesn't wait, they interrupt me all the time. Well, our kids have less waiting built into their lives. They do. They're not waiting for a movie. They're watching five minutes of a movie, maybe just a show, and they're like, "Nope, don't like this. Next, next, next, next, next." And so, we actually have to make sure with our kids, like I've actually said to my kid, I'm going to teach you waiting. It's a thing. It's a thing. It's still real. I'm going to make sure we learn it. And it is one of these reasons on the margin, right? I live in Manhattan and I might think, "Oh, I'm going to jump in a cab." You know what? I'm going to carve out more time and I'm going to go wait for the bus. Not just cuz it saves money, which I like, but because my kid actually needs more moments than I did based on my childhood to wait to literally learn how to wait and practice doing that.</p>

### 第四章：破裂、修复与深度感受型孩子

### 破裂与修复：关系中的“魔法”

“破裂”（Rupture）是一段关系中出现脱节的时刻。当信任被打破，当某事感觉可怕时，但真正的是当两个处于亲密关系中的人出现脱节。父母和孩子之间的破裂可能看起来像你作为父母对你的孩子大喊大叫。你发火了。你说“你是个被宠坏的孩子”。你用一种可怕的语气。“你为什么从来不听我的？”那是破裂的时刻。我想我们都知道它们，我们都有过。那真的很重要。没有父母是完美的，能避免破裂。破裂是每一段甚至充满爱的关系的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rupture is a moment in a relationship when there's a disconnection. When trust is broken, when something felt scary, but really when two people who are in a close relationship have disconnection. Rupture between a parent and a kid could look like you as a parent yell at your kid. You snap. You say you're a spoiled brat. You use a scary tone. Why don't you ever listen to me? That's the rupture moment. I think we all know them and we all have them. That's really important. No parent is perfect and avoids rupture. Rupture is part of every even loving relationship.</p>
</details>

“修复”（Repair）是你在破裂后重新连接。那通常涉及为你的部分承担责任，承认那对另一个人可能是什么样的，并谈论你下次想做什么不同的事情。现在，我认为思考修复和仅仅道歉之间的区别是强大的。很多时候，一个道歉对你来说感觉不好，因为它实际上看起来是想结束一个对话。像这样的事情。“对不起，我吼了。好的。对不起，我吼了。我们没事了。对不起，我吼了。你原谅我。对吧？”它要么是我希望从某人那里得到的东西。“我们没事了。对吧？”要么它是一个快速的对话终结者。“对不起。我们能继续吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Repair is when you reconnect following a rupture. And that often involves taking responsibility for your part, acknowledging what it might have been like for the other person and talking about what you want to do differently the next time. Now, I think it's powerful to think about the difference between a repair and kind of just an apology. So many times an apology doesn't feel good to you because it actually looks to shut a conversation down. Something like this. I'm sorry I yelled. Okay. I'm sorry I yelled. We're all right. I'm sorry I yelled. You forgive me. Right? It's either something I'm looking to get from someone. We're okay. Right? Or it's a quick conversation ender. I'm sorry. Can we move on?</p>
</details>

那对某人没有帮助，它不会重新连接。一个好的修复实际上会开启一个对话。所以步骤可能是，我说出发生了什么。我承担责任。也许我承认那对某人可能是什么样的。我谈论我下次可能做什么不同的事情。听起来有很多步骤，但它可以很短。“嘿，我早些时候在厨房对你大喊大叫了。我真的很抱歉。我当时感到非常沮丧，那以大喊的形式表现出来了。我肯定那对你来说感觉很可怕。我正在努力，即使在我沮丧的时候也能保持更冷静。”你也可以缩短那个。只是简单地说，“对不起，我早些时候在厨房对你大喊大叫了。那是不对的。”

<p class="english-text">That doesn't help someone and it doesn't reconnect. A good repair actually opens up a conversation. So the steps might be I name what happened. I take responsibility. Maybe I acknowledge what it might have been like for someone. And I talk about what I might do differently the next time. Sounds like a lot of steps, but it can be really short. Hey, I yelled at you earlier in the kitchen. I'm really sorry. I was feeling really frustrated and that came out as a yell. And I'm sure that felt scary to you. I'm going to work on staying calmer even when I'm frustrated. You can also shorten that. Just something simple like, "I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier in the kitchen. That wasn't okay."</p>

我在那里做的是，我回到那个破裂的时刻，我为我的部分承担责任。我也在我沟通的方式的本质上，不只是想继续前进。我甚至可能在之后补充，“如果你想和我谈谈，我愿意。如果你想告诉我那对你是什么感觉，你可以。如果有什么方式我们可以不同地处理它，我愿意听。”我真正做的是，而不是让那个破裂的时刻成为这个脱节，我知道那发生了。我不完美。我是人，不是机器人。但我能控制的是之后。我可以回去，提供一个非常不同的体验，那种体验围绕着破裂的时刻。那实际上真的改变了甚至最初的破裂在我们的关系中被记住的方式。

<p class="english-text">What I'm doing there is I'm going back to that moment of rupture and I'm taking responsibility for my part. I'm also in the nature of how I'm communicating, not just looking to move on. I might even add after if you want to talk to me about it, I'm open. If you want to tell me how that felt for you, you can. If there's some way that we could have handled it differently, I'm open to hearing that. And what I'm really doing then is instead of that rupture moment being this disconnection, I know that happened. I'm not perfect. I'm a human, not a robot. But what I can control is the after. I can go back and offer a very different experience that kind of surrounds the rupture moment. And that actually really changes the way even the original rupture gets remembered in our relationship.</p>

我们知道，记忆不仅是记住最初的事件，而且是记住你每次记住那个事件的其他时间。所以如果你把那个事件想象成，我不知道，一个圆圈或一个鹅卵石，在是的，那开始于一个记忆之间。但如果我然后说，即使有一个艰难的记忆，“然后我和我妈妈谈了。然后我在学校有一个指导顾问，他帮助我以一种新的方式理解它。”现在突然之间，我在那个鹅卵石周围有了这些层，下次我谈论它时的记忆，不仅仅是中心的东西。它是它周围的所有其他东西。这说明了修复的巨大力量，以及为什么我认为修复类似于做一个父母魔术师。

<p class="english-text">We know that memory is not only remembering the original event but remembering every other time you've remembered that event. So if you think about the event as I don't know a circle or a pebble in between yes that starts out of a memory. But whether I then say even with a hard memory and then I talked about it with my mom and then I had a guidance counselor at school who helped me understand it in a new way. Now all of a sudden I have these layers around that pebble and the memory the next time I talk about it isn't simply the thing in the center. It's all of the other things around it. which speaks to the immense power of repair and why I do think about repair as being similar to being a parent magician.</p>

所以，我的意思是这样的。我对我的孩子们大喊大叫过。我仍然对我的孩子们大喊大叫。我认为那很重要。我总是说，我从不想被放在神坛上。好的？我的孩子们没有贝姬博士作为妈妈。他们有贝姬。我正在尽我所能。我努力少喊，我努力多修复。我认为那对每个人来说都是最好的了。所以，假设有一个时刻，我在我的修复TED演讲中谈到了这个。这发生了，那是那些日子之一，非常紧张的一天，我的儿子抱怨晚餐。是像“又是鸡肉，恶心。”我费力地做了晚餐，我自己也不是很满意。但那只是太多事情的累积。我吼了。我想我叫他一个被宠坏的孩子，或者“你不感激我。”我的语气很可怕。

<p class="english-text">So, here's what I mean. I've yelled at my kids. I still yell at my kids. I think that's so important. I say always, I never want to be on a pedestal. Okay? My kids don't have Dr. Becky as a mom. They have Becky. And I'm doing my best. And I try to yell less and I try to repair a lot more. I think that's as good as it gets for everyone. So, let's say there's a moment, and I talked about this in my repair TED talk. This happened where it was one of those days, really stressful day and my son complained about dinner. It was something like chicken again, disgusting. And I had labored over cooking dinner and I wasn't terribly happy with it e either. But it was just the accumulation of too much. And I yelled. I think I called him a spoiled brat or you don't appreciate me. My tone was scary.</p>

在那一刻，如果我诚实地说，有点像，妈妈，我爱和需要的妈妈，我的稳固领导者变成了可怕的妈妈。所以他最终在他的房间里，我在厨房里。起初，是的，螺旋开始了。“我是个可怕的父母，对吧？”因为我把我自己的行为和我的身份混为一谈了。我把这个时刻，我评判我自己。我能够让自己镇定下来。我认为关于修复的真正秘密是你必须先和自己修复。“我是个正在经历困难的好父母。”那个时刻没有定义我，一次又一次。然后我最终去找我的孩子。但在我告诉你我说了什么之前，我想谈谈为什么修复会改变记忆。

<p class="english-text">And in that moment, if I'm honest, kind of mom, the mom I love and need, my sturdy leader became scary mom. And so he ended up in his room and I'm in the kitchen. And at first, yes, the spiral starts. I'm a horrible parent, right? Because I've collapsed my own behavior and my identity. I've taken this moment and I judge myself. I was able to ground myself. And I think the real secret about repair is you have to repair with yourself first. I'm a good parent who was having a hard time. That moment didn't define me over and over. Then I ended up going to my kid. But before I tell you what I said, I want to talk about why repair changes memory.</p>
</details>

这个事件已经发生了。我的孩子有这个时刻的这个记忆。“我妈妈在我对晚餐有一点温和的抱怨时对我大喊大叫。”好的。但如果我知道记忆不仅仅是事件，它是每次我记住那个事件的其他时间。那意味着当我去做修复时，“嘿，我刚才在厨房对你大喊大叫了。那是不对的。我肯定那感觉很可怕，我真的很抱歉。”我儿子的记忆将永远改变。现在不仅仅是这个，“哦天哪，我被吼了。”有“我被吼了，哇，我妈妈来为她做的事承担责任，坐在我的床上和我在一起，我不是一个人，我们重新连接了。”

<p class="english-text">This event already happened. My kid has this memory of this moment. My mom yelled at me when I had a kind of mild complaint about dinner. Okay. But if I know memory is not just the event, it's every other time I remembered the event. What that means is when I go repair, hey, I just screamed at you in the kitchen. That wasn't okay. I'm sure that felt scary and I'm really sorry. My son's memory will forever change. Now there's not just this, "Oh my goodness, I got yelled at." There's I got yelled at and wow, my mom came and took responsibility for what she did and sat with me on my bed and I wasn't alone and we reconnected.</p>
</details>

当你和你的孩子修复时，它不一定非要在那个时刻。有时候它的魔力我认为几乎发生在我们为更久以前的事情修复时。人们说，“修复太晚了吗？”不，你总是可以对你的孩子说，甚至是一些一般性的事情，“你小的时候有很多次，当你正在经历困难的时候，我只是把你送到你的房间，拿走你喜欢的东西。我只是在想，我最近学到了一些新东西。我回想那个，我肯定那对你来说感觉非常糟糕和不公平，我理解那个，我很抱歉，我想做一些不同的事情。我不会是完美的，但我想从现在开始做一些不同的事情。”

<p class="english-text">When you repair with your kid, and it doesn't just have to be in the moment. Sometimes the magic of it I think happens almost when we repair for something longer ago. People say, "Is it too late to repair?" No, you can always say to your kid, even something general, there were a lot of times when you were younger, when you were having a hard time, I just sent you to your room and took away things you liked. And I'm just thinking, I've learned something new recently. And I look back on that and I am sure that felt really bad and unfair to you and I understand that and I'm sorry and I want to do things a little differently. I'm not going to be perfect, but I want to do things differently from now on.</p>

现在，要清楚，很少有孩子得到那个然后说，“那是一次非常有意义的关系体验，爸爸。谢谢你。”那从未发生过。好的，你的孩子可能会看起来像是，“什么？好的，我能吃椒盐脆饼吗？”那不意味着它不重要。你实际上在改变你孩子的记忆，因为发生了什么的记忆，即使他们不总是在这里想着它，它已经储存在他们的身体里了。我们不能改变那个，那没关系。但我们可以在它上面分层。我们太多次地太专注于事件，而不是我们在事件之后拥有的力量。“哦，大喊大叫把我的孩子搞砸了。”现在，我不喜欢“搞砸了我的孩子”这个词。它太终结了。但如果我用那个语言，我会对一个父母说，“大喊大叫没有搞砸你的孩子。”大喊大叫后不修复。那才是搞砸你的孩子。但那是好消息，因为你仍然可以修复。所以，让我们学习那个技能，开始做它。

<p class="english-text">Now, to be clear, very few kids get that and say, "That was a really meaningful relational experience, Dad. Thank you. That has never happened." Okay, your kid might look like, "What? Okay, can I have pretzels? That doesn't mean it doesn't matter. You actually are changing your kid's memory because the memory of what happened, even if they're not thinking about it all the time up here, it already is stored in their body. We can't change that and that's okay. But we can layer on top of it. And too many times we focus so much on the event instead of the power we have after the event. Oh, yelling messed up my kid. Now, I don't like the term messed up my kid. It's too final. But if I use that language, I'd say to a parent, "Yelling's not messing up your kid." not repairing after yelling. That's what's messing up your kid. But that's good news because you can still repair. So, let's learn that skill and start to do it.</p>

### 深度感受型孩子（DFK）的内心世界

在我私人诊所里，随着我发展这些想法，发生的一件事是，我看到了很多父母来进行育儿工作。有一部分父母告诉我，“我的孩子有这些巨大的脾气。贝姬博士，这不是你以前见过的。像动物一样，嘶嘶叫，咆哮，抓我。我见过其他孩子。他们没有这样的脾气，我的孩子需要更长的时间才能冷静下来，他们为我从未做过的事情责备我。‘你为什么绊倒我？’我想，‘你只是在人行道上绊倒了。’就像，如果你尴尬，我很抱歉，但我甚至没有碰你。”所有这些事情。然后他们会对我说这个，“我正在做你告诉我要做的事情，但你的策略让事情变得更糟。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things that was happening in my private practice as I was developing these ideas is I was seeing so many parents for parenting work. And there were a subset of parents who were telling me, "My kid has these huge tantrums. Dr. Becky, it's not what you've ever seen before. Animalistic, hissing, growling, scratching me. I've seen other kids. They don't have tantrums like this and my kid takes longer to calm down and and they blame me for things I never did. Why did you trip me? And I'm thinking, you just tripped on the sidewalk. Like, sorry if you're embarrassed, but I wasn't even touching you. All these things. And then they'd say to me this, and I'm doing the things you told me to do, but your strategies are making things worse.</p>
</details>

好的，我很惭愧地说这个，但我觉得说实话很重要。我在这些会谈中的第一个想法常常是，“我只是不认为你做得对。就像，我不知道你是否以我会做的方式做，但就像，好的，我喜欢一个问题，我喜欢有创造力。所以，我们试试这个怎么样？或者我们试试这个怎么样？”然后我们开始取得很多进展。我不太明白到底为什么，但开始对这一类非常、非常强烈的情感孩子有所了解，他们会在他们最需要父母的时刻把父母推开。这种不具成效的舞蹈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I'm ashamed to say this, but I feel like leading with the truth is important. My first thought in these sessions was often, I just don't think you're doing it right. Like, I don't know if you're doing it the way I would do it, but like, okay, I love a problem and I love to be creative. And so, how about we try this or how about we try this? And then we started to make a lot of progress. And I didn't quite understand exactly why, but started to catch on with this kind of subset of like very, very intense emotional kids who would kind of push parents away in the moment they kind of needed parents the most. this kind of unproductive dance.</p>
</details>

然后我有了我的第二个孩子。我像是，“哦，哦，好的。我理解所有这些父母了，因为我知道我说的话和做的事和我对我第一个孩子的方式完全一样。”但当我验证我孩子的情绪时，“哦，你太难过了。”我得到的回应是这个。“别跟我说话。”我的一部分像是，“等等，这这应该有帮助。这对其他孩子有帮助。”然后我会看到这些像动物一样的崩溃。这有点像是唯一的，就像从0到60。它是如此强烈，冷静下来会花更长的时间。我只记得在想，“哦天哪，我必须给所有这些父母打电话说，‘好的，我完全和你们在一起。’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then I had my second kid. I was like, "Oh, oh, okay. I understand all of these parents because I know I'm saying things and doing things the exact same way I was at my first." But when I validate my kids feelings, oh, you're so sad. This is what I get IN RESPONSE. STOP TALKING TO ME. And a part of me is like, wait, this is this is supposed to help. This helped other kid. And then I would see these animalistic meltdowns. It's kind of the only way like the 0 to 60. It was so intense and the calming down would take so much longer. And I just remember thinking, "Oh my goodness, I have to call all these parents and say, "Okay, I am so with you."</p>
</details>

所以，我家里有这样一个孩子，然后我看到了很多这样的家庭，因为我想一旦我开始发展这种其他方法，我们取得了所有这些成功，就像所有的推荐都来了，我真的看到有这样一群孩子，我称之为**深度感受型孩子**（Deeply Feeling Kids, DFKs: 指那些对外界刺激和内在情绪感受更为强烈的孩子），他们真的在世界上以不同的方式运作。我认为我关于他们意识到的核心是，这些孩子对世界更具渗透性。如果你想想那意味着什么，如果你想想你皮肤上的毛孔，每个都更大，那将深刻影响你在世界上的体验，更多的东西会从你的环境中进来，这意味着你会更容易或更快地被淹没，对吧？而且在它全部出来的时候，因为你更具渗透性，更多的东西会出来。它会几乎是暴力和强烈的。他们的脾气和崩溃和抗议真的更强烈。父母需要知道你不是在编造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I had this kid in my house and then I was seeing so many of these families cuz I think once I started to develop this other approach and we had all this success like all these referrals came in and I really saw that there's this group of kids I call them deeply failing kids who really are kind of operating differently in the world. And I think the core thing I realized about them is these are kids who are more porous to the world. And if you think about what that means, if you think about the pores on your skin and each one being bigger, that would profoundly impact your experience in the world, more would actually come in from your environment, which means you would get overwhelmed more easily or more quickly, right? And also in the moments when it all came out, because you were more porous, more would come out. It would be almost violent and intense. And their tantrums and meltdowns and protests really are more intense. And parents need to know you're not making it up.</p>
</details>

我意识到的另一件事是，与非DFK不同，当非深度感受型孩子脆弱时，他们绊倒和摔倒。他们因为你离开而感到难过，别人必须让他们上床睡觉，他们真的接受安慰。他们不会马上冷静下来，但他们想要被安慰。深度感受型孩子，这很重要，当他们感到脆弱时，他们同时感到羞耻。羞耻让情绪变得爆炸性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing I realized about these kids is unlike non DFKs, when non deeply feeling kids are vulnerable, they trip and fall. They feel sad because you're leaving and someone else has to put them to bed, they really take in comfort. They don't get calm right away, but they want to be comforted. deeply feeling kids, and this is so important, when they feel vulnerable, they simultaneously feel shame. And shame makes feelings explosive.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么当深度感受型孩子绊倒或读错一个单词，或者甚至当他们内心只是觉得，“我爸爸出差时我会想他。”因为他们感觉如此强烈，他们如此敏锐地意识到他们强烈的情绪，他们开始想，“我是一个感觉非常强烈的人，我很容易被淹没，我非常需要我周围的成年人。但那些让我不知所措的事情，我担心也会让他们不知所措，所以我不能真的向他们求助，因为那样我就会失去我非常需要的那个人。”你可以想象这是一种如此矛盾的存在。如果人们在想，“你认为那是我三岁的孩子正在发生的事情吗？”百分之百。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is why when deeply feeling kids trip or mispronounce a word, or even when they internally just feel like, "I'm going to miss my dad when he's on a business trip." because they feel things so intensely and they're so acutely aware of their intense emotions, they start to think, I'm a really intensely feeling person and I get overwhelmed so easily and I so need the adults around me. But the things that overwhelm me, I'm worried are going to overwhelm them and so I can't really ask them for help because then I'm going to kind of lose the very person that I need. And you can imagine this is such a conflictual ex existence. And if people are thinking, "You think that's what's happening for my three-year-old?" 100%.</p>
</details>

所以当他们想你时，当他们尴尬时，他们会以愤怒爆发，并有点把人推开。这些是那些当他们有这些巨大的脾气，他们如此失控时，他们会说“离开我的房间。”但你有点想，“真的吗，就像你真的不在一个好地方做那个决定。”然后有时候我们上钩了，我们离开，我们说，“好吧，我只是想帮忙。”一旦我们关上门，一个DFK基本上会想，“看，我知道了。我真的像我担心的那样，对别人来说是那么糟糕和不知所措和有毒和太多了，”他们就走向了一个坏的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when they miss you, when they're embarrassed, they explode with anger and kind of push people away. These are the kids when they're having these massive tantrums and they are so out of control, they get out of my room. But you're kind of thinking like really, like you're not really in a good place to make that decision. And then sometimes we take the bait and we leave and we say, "Fine, I'm just trying to help." And as soon as we close the door, essentially what a DFK thinks is, "See, I knew it. I really am as bad and overwhelming to others and toxic and too much as I worried I was, and they're off to the races in a bad way.</p>
</details>

我开始对这些孩子着迷。我认为他们是最被误解的孩子，不幸的是，我必须说，即使在临床世界里，这些孩子也常常被贴上“对立违抗”的标签，父母被告知——每个曾经做过我们整个深度感受型孩子项目的父母都告诉我，“是的，我总是被告知你不够严厉，你对暂停不够一致。”所有这些，尤其对DFK来说，只会证实他们最大的恐惧，“我对别人来说太多了，太坏了，”只会让他们更容易受到我们希望摆脱的所有坏行为的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have come to be obsessed with these kids. I think they are the most misunderstood kids and unfortunately I have to say even in the clinical world too often these kids are labeled as oppositional defiant and parents are told every parent who ever has done our whole deeply feeling kid program tells me yeah I've always told you're not being harsh enough you're not being consistent enough with timeouts all that does especially for DFKs is confirm their biggest fear I am too much too bad for others and only makes them even more vulnerable to all the bad behavior we're looking to shift away from.</p>
</details>

现在，这不意味着那些孩子在他们爆炸时需要一个派对。不。但我已经发展出一种理解那些孩子的方式，以及我称之为“侧门策略”的东西。你看，当典型的孩子，不是典型的，但当非深度感受型孩子难过时，你有点像把他们想象成在他们的房子里，你可以有点走到他们的前门，你像是，“嘿，我来支持你了。”他们有点像回应，“当然，进来吧。嘿，你哥哥说你不能和他和他的朋友一起玩，那太难了，对吧？”一个非深度感受型孩子会有点去，“对，”你有点知道你有那个时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this doesn't mean those kids need a party when they're exploding. No. But I've developed this way of understanding those kids and and something I call a side door strategy. See, when typical kids, not typical, but when non-defailing kids are upset, you kind of picture them in their house and you can kind of go up to their front door and you're like, "Hey, I'm here to support you." And they kind of respond like, "Sure, come on in. Hey, it was so hard when your brother said you couldn't play with him and his friend, right?" And a little bit a non-deley feeling kid will go right and you kind of know you have that moment.</p>
</details>

你对一个深度感受型孩子那样说，他们会，他们会把门摔在你脸上。“离开我的房间。别谈感觉了。”但我们误解了那是他们不想要我们的支持。那只是太直接了。它几乎像是太近了。所以我已经发展出一种理解的方式，我们必须绕到侧面。你要绕过什么？你必须绕过他们的羞耻，那实际上是他们的恐惧，他们所有的大情绪都会导致脱节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You say that to a deeply feeling kid and they do they slam the door in your face. GET OUT OF MY ROOM. STOP talking about feelings. But we misconstrue that as them not wanting our support. It's just too direct. It's like almost too close. And so I've developed this way of understanding we have to go around to the side. And what are you going around? You have to go around their shame, which is actually their fear that all their big feelings will lead to disconnection.</p>
</details>

所以，只是一个例子，它可能听起来是这样的。“看，我要说一件事，我不知道它是否是真的，它可能不会，但如果我说一件事，你同意它，给我一个竖起大拇指。如果你有点同意，但有点认为它是错的，给我一个拇指到侧面。如果我说一件事是完全错的，给我一个拇指向下。”现在，专业提示。当你为一个DFK做这个，你知道你有一个DFK，当这个击中时，首先说一些他们会拒绝的东西。为什么？深度感受型孩子基于他们的恐惧，他们需要滴定亲近。他们有点需要在他们接受你之前把你推开一点。所以你可能会先说，“我想你早些时候难过是因为我答应你我会带你去月球，而航天飞机还没准备好。”也许我会对一个喜欢太空的孩子那样说，我的孩子会从他们的床上去这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, just as one example of that, it might sound like this. Look, I'm going to say something and I don't know if it's true, it probably won't be, but if I say something and you agree with it, give me a thumbs up. If you kind of agree, but kind of think it's wrong, give me a thumb to the side. And if I say something that's totally wrong, give me a thumbs down. Now, pro tip. When you do this for a DFK and you know you have a DFK when this hits, first say something that they're going to reject. Why? Deeply feeling kids based on their fears, they need to titrate closeness. They kind of need to push you away a little before you they take you in. So you might say first, I think you're upset earlier because I promised you I would take you to the moon and the space shuttle just wasn't ready. Maybe I'd say that to a kid who loves space and my kid's going to go like this from their bed.</p>
</details>

“不。”在内心你会想，“哦，我赢定了。”因为然后你可以说这样的话。这是一个家庭和我分享的确切例子。他们这样做了，他们说的第二件事是，“我想当你和你的哥哥和他的朋友一起玩，你被包括在内，然后突然之间他们想要一些独处的时间，那真的很难。”这个家庭告诉我，孩子给了一个拇指到侧面，对一个DFK来说，就像在开始时最好的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. And inside you'll think, "Oh, I'm so winning." Because then you can say something like this. This is an exact example that a family shared with me. They did this and the second thing they said was, "I think it's really hard when you're playing with your brother and his friend and you're included and then all of a sudden they want some alone time." And this family told me the kid gave a thumb to the side with for a DFK is like as good as it gets in the beginning.</p>
</details>

那个父母告诉我，“我只是很高兴。那就像我们一段时间以来的第一次连接，我只是有点什么都没说。我像是震惊得僵住了，”那个孩子说，“再问我一个问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the parent told me I was just so happy. It was like the first connection we'd had in a while and I just kind of didn't say anything. I was like frozen in shock and the kid goes, "Ask me another question."</p>
</details>

深度感受型孩子会变得如此不知所措，挣扎着理解自己。真的，对一个孩子来说，最糟糕的事情之一是不可理解。太多时候对于DFK，因为我们认为我们必须以严厉领先，或者对惩罚更一致，他们实际上变得越来越糟，因为他们感到如此不可理解。那对一个孩子来说是最糟糕的感觉。“没有人理解我。”它几乎像是，“我甚至是真实的吗？我是谁？”所有孩子都需要感到被理解。我认为对于深度感受型孩子更难，因为传统的试图理解你孩子的方法，他们确实会拒绝。然后我们可以把那个看得很个人化。我们觉得，“嘿，我正在尽我最大的努力，你正在阻止我感觉像一个好父母。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Deeply feeling kids get so overwhelmed and struggle to understand themselves. And truly, one of the worst things for a kid is to be ununderstandable. And too often for DFKs, because we think we have to lead with harshness or be more consistent with punishments, they actually get worse and worse because they feel so ununderstandable. It's the worst feeling for a kid. Nobody understands me. It's almost like, am I even real? Who am I? All kids need to feel understood. I think it's harder with deeply feeling kids because traditional methods of trying to understand your kid, they do reject. And then we can take that very personally. We feel like, "Hey, I'm trying my hardest and you're stopping me from feeling like a good parent."</p>
</details>

但重要的是要知道，在孩子们行为失常之后，在那次打人和那次像动物一样的脾气之后，或者在你的孩子对你说了些可怕的话，他们独自在他们的房间里之后，只是想象那个孩子实际上是如此不知所措和害怕，因为他们是孤独的，这很重要。现在，那不意味着我们应该马上跑到我们的孩子那里。我们可能需要先调节我们自己。连接可以意味着很多事情，但找到一种再次与你的孩子亲近的方式，甚至在你的脑海里记住，“等等，我没有一个坏孩子。我有一个正在经历困难的好孩子。”稍后找到你的孩子说，“看，我知道我们都有我们不为之骄傲的时刻。我爱你。你做的任何事都不能改变我爱你。”那非常、非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what's important to know is after kids act out, after that hitting and that anim animalistic tantrum, or after your kid says something awful to you and they're alone in their room, it's just so important to imagine that that kid is actually so overwhelmed and frightened because they're alone. Now, that doesn't mean we should run to our kid right away. We might need to regulate oursel first. And connection can mean a lot of things, but finding a way to be close to your kid again, to even remember in your head, wait, I don't have a bad kid. I have a good kid who is having a hard time. Finding your kid later and saying, look, I know we all have moments when we do things we're not proud of. I love you. Nothing you could ever do would change that I love you. That is so, so important.</p>
</details>

所以那个时刻，还有很多其他方式你可以有点绕过羞耻。与这些孩子的动态完全改变，他们变得更能管理他们的情绪，实际上他们能够接触到作为DFK的所有惊人的部分。他们是这些强烈感觉的人，当你绕过坏行为和羞耻时，你看到他们强烈的喜悦，他们如此有趣，他们是领导者，他们如此自信，所以深度感受型孩子有点像我在“内在良善”这个激情项目中的激情项目。嗯，我只是很兴奋更多的人能以那个框架思考他们的孩子，或者甚至他们自己。

<p class="english-text">And so that moment and there's so many other ways you can kind of go around the shame. The dynamic with these kids completely change and they become much more able to manage their emotions and actually they get to tap into all the amazing parts about being a DFK. They are these intensely feeling people which when you get around the bad behavior and the shame, you see their intense joy and they're so funny and they're leaders and they're so self assured and so deeply feeling kids are kind of my passion project within the passion project that is good inside. Um, and I'm just excited for more people to think about their kids or maybe even themselves in that framework.</p>

<p class="english-text">Chapter 5, four habits that build emotional strength. I think about four daily habits that really, really compound in a beautiful way over time in terms of parenting your kid. And I'm going to go over all four. You don't have to do all four every day, but it kind of gives you a little menu.</p>

第一，照顾好你自己。那是一个成为稳固领导者的非常重要的部分。如果你想想最稳固的飞行员，他们绝不会说，“我太爱驾驶我的乘客了，以至于我已经连续驾驶了30天。我甚至没有一刻给自己，对不起，我要下那架飞机了。我不会让那个飞行员飞我。”事实上，有法律强制规定飞行员必须休息。作为父母，我们必须自己思考那个。自我照顾不是自私。自我照顾是自我维持。

<p class="english-text">Number one is taking care of yourself. That is a really important part of being a sturdy leader. If you think about the sturdiest pilot, they would never say, "I love piloting my passengers so much that I have piloted for 30 straight days. And I haven't even had a moment to myself, I'm sorry, I'm getting off that plane. I am not letting that pilot fly me. In fact, there are laws to mandate that pilots get rest." As parents, we have to think about that ourselves. Self-care is not selfish. Self-care is self- sustaining.</p>

孩子们不需要殉道者。他们需要稳固的领导者。那意味着父母必须照顾好自己。所以照顾好你自己的实践应该是一个日常习惯。那不意味着，“哦，我要去巴黎6个月。我在照顾我自己。”我的意思是，如果那是你能够做并且对家庭有效的事情，对我们大多数人来说，那意味着，“我要坐下来，趁热喝我的咖啡。我要做我自己的早餐。我要喝点水。我要留出时间，我会静止，而不是一直跑来跑去。我要早点睡觉。我要锻炼。我要见一个朋友。”那是一个重要的日常习惯。

<p class="english-text">And kids don't need martyrs. They need sturdy leaders. And that means parents have to take care of themselves. So the practice of taking care of yourself should be a daily habit. And that doesn't mean, oh, I'm going to go to Paris for 6 months. I'm taking care of myself. I mean, if that's something that you're able to do and it works for the family, for most of us, what that means is I'm going to sit down and drink my coffee while it's hot. I'm going to make my own breakfast. I'm going to have some water. I'm gonna carve out time where I'm still instead of running around all the time. I'm gonna go to bed early. I'm gonna work out. I'm gonna see a friend. That's an important daily habit.</p>

第二，与你的孩子建立连接。随着时间的推移，与你的孩子真正复合的是连接。我喜欢策略和脚本和这里那里的小技巧，但事实是，当你的孩子长大后，你真正拥有的唯一策略是连接。这也是我对暂停和贴纸奖励表最大的问题之一。我见过太多的家庭，有一个16岁的孩子，他停止上学了。他们像是，“你不能让我去。”或者他们在做非常、非常危险的事情。他们从未完全说过这个，但他们有点通过他们的行为这样做。“我太大了，不能被关禁闭了。而且我对贴纸一点也不在乎。”你花了16年不与我连接或了解我，我们之间真的什么都没有，那很可怕。

<p class="english-text">Number two, connecting with your kid. The thing that really compounds over time with your kid is connection. I love strategies and scripts and little hacks here and there, but the truth is the only strategy you really have with your kid when they get older is connection. And this is one of my biggest issues also with timeouts and sticker charts. I've seen too many families where there's a 16-year-old who stops going to school. They're like, "You can't make me." Or they're doing really, really dangerous things. And they never quite say this, but they kind of do through their behavior. I'm too big to put in a timeout. And I don't give a fill in the blank about stickers. and you have spent 16 years not connecting to me or getting to know me and there's really nothing between us and that's terrifying.</p>

唯一能让一个16岁的孩子听你关于宵禁的规则，或者告诉你一些他们在学校或和朋友需要帮助的相当混乱的事情，是他们感到与你连接。建立连接永远不晚，但连接会复合。我们在我们的孩子们还小的时候投入的工作，与他们谈论困难的事情，理解他们对一些不会让我们难过的事情感到难过，当我们的孩子们长大后，那会以一种巨大的方式复合，连接真的是我们之间唯一的东西。

<p class="english-text">The only thing that makes a 16-year-old listen to your rule about a curfew or tell you about something pretty messy that they need help with at school or with friends is that they feel connected with you. And it's never too late to build connection, but connection compounds. The work we put in when our kids are younger, to talk to them about hard things, to understand that they're upset about something that wouldn't upset us, that compounds in a massive way when our kids are older and connection is really the only thing between us.</p>

第三，把困难的情绪看作是我们想帮助我们的孩子坐下来面对，而不是修复的东西。情绪不是用来修复的。如果我们想有真正有韧性、不脆弱、不娇气的孩子，我们必须确保我们的孩子们正在学习如何坐下来面对困难的情绪，而不是把我们看作是困难情绪的修复者或出口。

<p class="english-text">Number three is seeing hard feelings as something we want to help our kids sit with, not fix. Feelings are not for fixing. And if we want to have kids that are really resilient and not fragile and not entitled, we have to make sure our kids are learning how to sit with hard feelings rather than looking to us as the fixer or the exit of hard feelings.</p>
</details>

“我没进足球队。”现在，当然，也许有时间想想，“另一个镇有足球队吗？”但不是首先。“哦，那太糟了。”坐下来面对失望，而不是立即退出。

<p class="english-text">I didn't make the soccer team. Now, sure, maybe there's a time to think, is there a soccer team in another town? But not first. Oh, that stinks. Sit with disappointment rather than an immediate exit.</p>
</details>

“我是我班上唯一一个不会读的人。”“我很高兴你告诉我那个。告诉我更多。今天班上发生了什么？”而不是“那不可能是真的。嗯，至少你擅长下棋。”无论我们说什么来把我们的孩子们从情绪中拉出来。到你成年时变得有韧性，是从看到你能应对困难的情绪和困难的情况，而不是完全避免它们复合而来的。

<p class="english-text">I'm the only one in my class who can't read. I'm so glad you're telling me about that. Tell me more. What happened in class today? Rather than that can't be true. Well, at least you're good at chess. Whatever we say to lift our kids out of the feelings. Becoming resilient by the time you're an adult compounds from seeing that you can cope with hard feelings and hard situations, not entirely avoid them.</p>
</details>

第四个习惯是修复。我实际上一直告诉父母，如果你要在育儿中变得非常、非常好，就在修复上变得非常好。如果你反过来想，那几乎是公开允许犯错，因为你实际上不能修复，如果没有破裂。所以，变得擅长修复的唯一方法是有一个你感觉不好的时刻。所以，我希望你能用轻松的心情使用那个，就像，“等等，我正在努力变得擅长修复。第一步可能是对我的孩子大喊大叫，好的，检查。我做了第一步，你知道，他们总是说第一步是最难的一步，所以我猜我只是在路上了，现在我可以练习修复了。我正在做修复的日常习惯。”修复非常重要。

<p class="english-text">And the fourth habit is repair. I actually tell parents all the time, if you're going to get really good, really good at something in parenting, get really good at repair. If you back into that, it's almost overt permission to mess up because you actually can't repair if there's not a rupture. So, the only way to get good at repair is to have a moment that you didn't feel good about. And so, I hope you can use that with levity, like, wait, I'm trying to get good at repair. Step one is maybe yelling at my kid, okay, check. I did the first step, you know, and they always say the first step is the hardest step, so I guess I'm just well on my way, and now I get to practice repair. I'm doing the daily habit of repair. Repair matters so much.</p>

所以，自我照顾，连接，帮助孩子容忍困难的情绪，而不是从中退出，以及修复。那是四个真的、真的会随着时间的推移复合的习惯。拿一个困难的时刻，然后形成这个句子，“我是一个好人，我……”是改变人生的。“我是一个好人，我对我的孩子大喊大叫了。”“我是一个好人，我上班迟到很多次。”“我是一个好人，我挣扎着在关系中诚实地表达我的感觉。”我们最困难的时刻常常是因为我们只是再次评判我们自己。我们把行为和身份混为一谈。一个快速的分离身份和行为的捷径，实际上只是有一个句子开头。“我是一个好人，我……”那向你自己确立了“我内在良善”。

<p class="english-text">So self-care, connection, helping kids tolerate hard feelings, not exit from them, and repair. Those are the four habits that really, really compound over time. Taking a hard moment and kind of forming the sentence, I'm a good person who is life-changing. I'm a good person who yelled at my kid. I'm a good person who's been late to work a lot. I'm a good person who struggles to be honest about my feelings in relationships. So often our hardest moments come because we just judge oursel again. We collapse behavior and identity. And a quick little cheat to separate identity and behavior is actually just to have the sentence starter. I'm a good person who that establishes to yourself right I'm good inside.</p>

那本身就是一种治愈。然后你可以说出你想要好奇的行为，你想要围绕它建立技能的行为。我向你保证，那个句子结构为你设置了如此多的积极改变，而不是我们很多人可能倾向于的这种总是自我批评、自我指责、对自己的负面循环。

<p class="english-text">And that in of itself is kind of healing. And then you can name the behavior that you want to get curious about, that you want to build skills around. And I promise you that sentence structure sets you up for so much more positive change as opposed to this always self-critical, self-laming, negative to self cycle a lot of us can tend to be in.</p>
