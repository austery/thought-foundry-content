### 心理健康服务现状

**主持人**: 抑郁症及其他心理健康问题患者被鼓励寻求帮助以获得治疗和支持，并且理论上存在各种治疗方法。但现实中，在安大略省，这些治疗的实际可及性如何？我从加拿大心理健康协会安省分会CEO **Camille Kenville** 那里获得了一些关于可及性、等待时间和我们系统状况的见解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: People with depression and other mental health issues are encouraged to ask for help to get treatment and support and there are various treatments available at least in theory. In reality though, how accessible are they in Ontario. I got insight into access weight times and the state of our system from Camille Kenville, CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario Division.

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 我很好，很高兴和您一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: I'm great. Nice to be with you.

</details>

**主持人**: 很高兴您能来和我们聊聊这个话题。我想先从宏观层面谈谈。您如何评价本省居民在心理健康服务可及性方面的水平？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's awesome that you can uh be here with us to talk about it. I want to talk big picture first. How would you characterize the level of access for people in this province when it comes to mental health services?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 坦白说，远不如它应有的或可能达到的水平。嗯，有很多工作正在进行以使其变得更好。我们正与多个合作伙伴合作，涵盖医院部门、初级保健伙伴以及其他非营利组织。我们都在努力协作，寻找方法来确保人们获得所需的 পরিষেবা。我想说，我们在实际操作层面，协调性远不如我们本可以做到的。对人们来说，可能很难找到并获得他们所需的护理。我们对此非常清楚，并非常希望确保人们知道并理解，社区为基础的系统是为他们服务的，并且我们非常希望让他们远离急诊室，甚至远离医生办公室，我们可以直接提供他们可能需要的支持，而无需通过那两个其他途径。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Not really as good as it could or should be. Uh there is a lot of work happening to make it better. We are uh working with multiple partners uh across uh both the hospital sector, primary care partners and other nonprofit organizations. All of us trying to collaborate and find ways to make sure that people are getting the services that they need. And we are, I would say, um not nearly as coordinated as we could be on the ground. Uh probably difficult for people to navigate and find the kind of care they need. We're very cognizant of that. and really very interested in ensuring that people know and understand that the community-based system is there to serve them and that we are uh very interested in keeping them out of emergency departments and and even out of their doctor's office and and we can provide the kind of support that they likely need directly uh without having to access those other two um two groups.

</details>

### 系统设计与资源投入

**主持人**: 在弥合差距方面，这在多大程度上是关于资源和资金的问题，又在多大程度上是关于系统的整体设计和效率？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: when it comes to closing the gap, to what extent is it about resourcing and funding versus sort of the overall design and efficiency of the system?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 说实话，这三者都有。所以，系统的设计方面，我们目前的连接不够高效。我认为初级保健方面有很多努力和精力投入，这无疑是我们必须确保社区连接起来的地方。绝大多数寻求支持的人都会去看他们的家庭医生（如果他们有的话）。理想情况下，他们会获得转介到社区为基础的提供者，或者通过该医生获得某种护理或治疗。但归根结底，这是一个“**fractured system**”（破碎的系统），因为我们有多个提供者，但并不总是有途径帮助人们获得他们所需的精确护理，而且显然要避免最糟糕的情况，即坐在急诊室里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Well, it's a little bit of all of that mix if you want the truth. So, the the design of the system is one in which we're we're not linking uh as as efficiently uh as we might be able to. And I think again there's a lot of effort and energy happening on the primary care front and that is without question where we need to make sure community is connected. The vast majority of people who are looking for support are going to their family physician if they have one. Um and ideally they are are getting a referral to a community-based provider or they're getting some kind of care or treatment through that individual. Um but you know at the end of the day it is a it is a fractured system in the sense that we have multiple providers and and not necessarily the means to to help people get to the exact kind of care they need and you know obviously out of the worst case scenario which is sitting in an emergency department.

</details>

### 初级保健与替代方案

**主持人**: Camille，您提到了初级保健医生。我们知道，本省并非人人都能获得初级保健医生。如果人们遇到困难，这似乎是他们应该首先去的地方吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Camille, so you had mentioned primary care doctors. As we know, uh not everyone in this province has access to a primary care doctor. It seems like is that is that the first place uh people should be going if they are struggling?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 嗯，老实说，希望不是。希望人们能够直接找到社区的提供者。此外，还有 **安大略省结构化心理治疗项目 (Ontario structured psychotherapy program)**，对于许多有轻度至中度问题的患者来说，他们可以完全免费地获得服务。这是一个很棒的项目，提供了极佳的可及性。人们可以按需访问。他们学习认知行为疗法（CBT）技能，这些技能可以终生使用。我们社区的目标是尽一切可能减轻急性护理系统的负担，并提供人们所需的护理和服务，让他们不必去看医生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Well, to be honest, hopefully not. Uh hopefully there is uh an ability to navigate into community um and to a provider on the ground. Um there is also the Ontario structured psychotherapy program which for many many people who have mild to moderate uh issues are able to access and receive services entirely free of charge. It is a um a fantastic program that gives great accessibility. People can access it as they wish. Uh they learn cognitive behavioral therapy skills. These are skills they can use throughout their lifetime. Anything we can do to really reduce the burden on the acute care system is is uh always our goal in community and to provide the kind of services and resources that people need to stay out of stay out of doctor's offices.

</details>

### 对新疗法的乐观态度

**主持人**: 如今，有针对抑郁症和焦虑症的一整套尖端技术，这引起了很多兴奋。在我们之前的采访中，精神科医生 Roger McIntyre 曾表示，他职业生涯三十年来从未如此充满希望。您是否也抱有同样的乐观态度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Even there are a whole new suite of cutting edge technology uh for depression anxiety and there's a lot of excitement around it. In our previous interview, uh, psychiatrist Roger McIntyre said he's the most hopeful he's ever been in his three decade career. Do you share that same optimism?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 我对心理健康和成瘾领域正在发生的事情感到无比兴奋，尤其是在心理健康方面，正如您所指出的，我们看到了新的治疗方法和新的途径，人们可以通过这些途径获得所需的帮助和支持。长期以来，我们一直饱受污名化的困扰，这不仅体现在人们如何避免寻求治疗而默默承受痛苦，还体现在缺乏投资来提供这些新的疗法和为人们服务。所以，这是一个令人难以置信的激动人心的时刻。与那些对工作重拾喜悦的精神科医生和其他人交谈很有趣。我们看到像 **Sunnybrook** 这样的地方，**Gary Hervitz 脑科学项目**，我最近有机会看了一下。看到身心健康护理在一个没有污名的空间里融合在一起，人们可以像接受 MRI 或其他治疗一样获得所需的护理，这真是太棒了。这是前沿的，极具前瞻性，对于我们这些在心理健康领域度过了职业生涯大部分时间的人来说，这确实令人激动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: I am incredibly enthusiastic about what's happening in the mental health uh, and addictions world and particularly in mental health where we're seeing uh, as you point out new treatments and uh, new methods in which uh, people can get the help and support that they need. Uh we've really suffered with stigma for a very long time in this not only in terms of how people uh either avoid seeking treatment and suffer silently or um really not having the investments to be able to make these kinds of new uh modalities and serving people available. So it is an incredibly exciting time. It's fun to talk to psychiatrists and others who uh have a renewed joy with their work. And we're seeing places like Sunnybrook, the the Gary Hervitz brain sciences program, which I recently had the chance to have a look at. And it is so wonderful to see physical health care and mental health care coming together into one space where there's no stigma and people can come in and get the kind of care they need in the same way that you would access needing an MRI or any of those kinds of treatments. And that is leading edge and so forward thinking and and it's really wonderfully exciting for all of us who have spent a lot of time in their career in mental health.

</details>

### 新疗法的成本与可及性

**主持人**: 当您谈到可及性时，我们确实不得不谈论成本。我很好奇，像 **ketamine**（氯胺酮）这样的某些治疗方法，用于治疗抑郁症，可以在短短几次治疗中完成。您是否好奇，它们是否可能比其他形式的治疗更便宜？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When you talk about access, we do have to talk about costs and I am curious some of these treatments uh such as ketamine uh for depression can be administered in just a few sessions. Um I am curious are they potentially less expensive than any other forms of treatment?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 嗯，坦白说，我们在社区中最熟悉的治疗方法是为个人提供小组会议、一对一会议，以及避免采用 **ketamine** 所服务的“治疗抵抗”途径。所以，我们的世界略有不同，因为我们主要与个人一对一合作。我们提供案例管理，为患有严重且持续性精神疾病的个体提供服务，支持他们真正地满足他们的需求。所以，医学界会管理 **ketamine** 并提供这些服务，理想情况下能帮助人们走出漫长的、治疗抵抗的旅程。现在我们有了这些新疗法。当然，其中一些还处于早期阶段，但本省的人们是否能获得适当的治疗？当然，有很多兴奋之处，人们可能很想看看这是否适合他们，但他们能否获得呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Well, the treatments that frankly we are most familiar with in community are are services that are um available to individuals in in group sessions, in one-on-one sessions, and in ways that that uh avoid having to go the treatment resistant route, which ketamine uh serves. Um so, our world is slightly different in the sense that we're really working one-on-one with individuals. We provide case management. uh we provide services to individuals with very serious and persistent mental illness uh through uh supports that that really meet them where they're at. Um and so the medical world will manage ketamine and be able to provide those services and and ideally bring people out of what has been a long journey as they have been treatment resistant. Now we have these new treatments. Of course, early days for some of these, but do people in this province have proper access to them? Of course, there's lots of excitement and people are probably itching to kind of see is this something that will be suitable for them, but will they have access to it?

</details>

### 系统差距与改进建议

**Camille Kenville**: 嗯，这是一个非常好的问题，老实说，我们的系统存在差距，也存在地理上的差距，而且在省内的不同地区情况确实不同。虽然我们一直在倡导这一点，不仅是针对这些独特、新颖的疗法和技术（在某些情况下），更是为了人们日常所需的普通服务，无论是获得住房支持（通过支持性住房），还是获得针对双相情感障碍、抑郁症等疾病的护理和治疗。我们真心希望全省能有一个“**level playing field**”（公平的竞争环境），让任何被诊断出疾病的人都能确切地知道他们可以期待什么样的治疗，以及在系统内的发展轨迹。在建立一些标准方面正在取得巨大进展，我们很乐意参与其中，但我们还有很长的路要走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Well, that that is a a very good question and quite honestly, we have gaps throughout the system and we have geographical gaps as well and it does look different depending on where you are in the province. Though this is something that we routinely advocate for, not just in terms of these unique and new emerging modalities and technologies in some cases, but really for everyday services that people need to access, whether it's um you know uh the ability to have a a home uh through supportive housing, the ability to get the kind of care and treatment for uh bipolar issues, depression, all of these things. Um, you know, we really would like a level playing field across this province where anybody who is diagnosed knows exactly what they can expect in terms of their treatment, in terms of their trajectory within the system. There's great progress being made in building standards around some of this work and we're happy to be part of that, but we we've got a long way to go.

</details>

**主持人**: 关于这一点，您有什么建议可以改善本省心理健康服务的总体可及性吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: with that. What's one recommendation that you have that could improve access in general uh to mental health services in this province?

</details>

**Camille Kenville**: 嗯，很难只选一个，但我明显偏向于**社区为基础的系统**。我认为，当我走遍全省，访问我们的27个分支机构，看到基层发生的事情时，它在某种程度上确实是系统的“**heart and soul**”（心脏和灵魂）。如果我们能将精力和资源投入到我的同事们身上，他们正在做着极其困难的工作，服务无家可归者，服务患有非常严重疾病的人，包括年轻人，包括因各种原因被边缘化的人，包括一些有成瘾问题的人。如果我们能把资源投入到那里，那里更有效率地让他们保持稳定，并理想情况下按时服药，远离急性护理系统，节省这些资源对于那些需要这种护理水平的人来说非常重要。我认为我们可以在社区做得更多，我知道我的同事们会非常希望看到他们的工作得到扩展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Camille Kenville**: Well, it's hard to really think about one, but [clears throat] I have an obvious bias towards the community-based system. I think as I travel the province and and visit with our 27 branches and I see what's happening on the ground, it is really in some ways uh the the heart and soul of the system. And if we can put energy and resources into uh my colleagues who are doing the incredibly difficult work of serving the homeless, serving people who have very serious uh illnesses, including uh young people, including individuals who uh have been disenfranchised for various reasons, some who have addictions. If we could put the resources there where it's much more efficient to keep them uh stable and ideally on their medication and outside of the acute care system, saving those resources are really important for those who need that level of care. And I think we could just be doing a great deal more in community and and I know my colleagues would uh ideally love to see much of their work expand.

**主持人**: 我们就谈到这里。Camille，非常感谢您的见解。非常感谢您来到“The Rundown”节目。这是我的荣幸。谢谢您。
