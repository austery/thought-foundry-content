title: 市场收盘：Rocket Lab 与 Big Bear AI 财报超预期，Coreweave 因指引承压
---

### 市场全面上涨与背后动因

大家好，欢迎回到“市场收盘”节目。今天是11月10日，星期一，我们迎来了全面上涨的一天。**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）指数收于681.95点，远高于今早还在677点附近徘徊的水平。能够站稳在680点以上是一个非常积极的信号，这是我早上谈到的核心水平之一。最终，指数当天上涨了10个点，涨幅1.62%，带动了整个市场的活跃气氛。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. It is Monday, November 10th. And folks, we went green. We went green. Oh boy, did we go green. S&P 500 at 681.95. We were barely pushing 677 this morning and we were bouncing around 655 to 677. Now we are well above 680 at least at you know pushing 682 and every dollar on the S&P really does matter. So seeing that hit above 680 is really nice to see. That's one of the core levels I talked about this morning. If we can get above 680 and then close above 680, we're up 10 bucks on the day up 1.62%. And that's causing everything to have some fun.</p>
</details>

个股方面表现抢眼：SoFi一度上涨10%，收盘时仍有8.84%的涨幅。Grab上涨6%，谷歌作为一家市值3.2万亿美元的公司，上涨4%意义重大。Nvidia上涨6%，股价接近200美元。Palantir大涨9%，股价回升至193美元。Robin Hood、Meta、Amazon、Salesforce甚至Reddit都录得上涨。加密货币方面，比特币和以太坊相对平稳，比特币站上了104,000美元的水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">SoFi, what a day. It was up 10% at one point. Right now 8.84. I think if you are a SoFi shareholder, you will take it. You got SoFi right there. Looks like it's going to get that close above 30.50. Grab right there up 6%. Google up 4%. 290 4% on a $3.2 trillion company is a big deal. Nvidia pushing 200 up 11 bucks. That's up 6%. Palantir 9% on the day at 193. That's a $16 rebound. Robin Hood right here at 137 again. S&P at 681. Meta's up 2%. Amazon's up 2%. Salesforce up half percent. Even Reddit's up 6%. Apple's up a third of a percent. SMCI is up too. Bitcoin and Ethereum relatively flat. Ethereum right there at 3500. Bitcoin at 106. Bitcoin at least above that 104 level it was at in the morning. And that's why BMR right here is at 4172 up 3%.</p>
</details>

那么，市场为何出现如此强劲的反弹？主要有两个原因。第一，政府停摆问题虽然尚未正式结束，但很可能在未来三天内解决。昨天参议院的程序性投票是市场真正关心的。第二，围绕AI交易的恐惧情绪可能有所缓解。我们会讨论一些导致恐惧情绪下降的新闻，当然也有一些可能加剧恐惧的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it is very very very nice to see that we are getting a green rebound. And now the number one question I think people are having are why are we getting that green rebound? And obviously there's two main answers. Number one is the shutdown has not officially come to an end, but in the next three days it should likely come to an end. We got that Senate procedural vote yesterday. That's what the market really cared about. And then number two, you've got potentially a little bit of less fear around the nature of this AI trade. And there are some headlines we'll talk about for why that fear is potentially going down. There's also some headlines for why that fear could be going up.</p>
</details>

其中一则负面消息来自 Michael Burry，他几年来首次在推特上点名批评公司，特别是Meta、Oracle和Nvidia，称它们低估了折旧，从而夸大了盈利。他还预告11月25日情况会更糟。尽管如此，这则消息并未阻止他持有大量看跌头寸的Palantir和Nvidia股价上涨。Palantir当天上涨9%，Nvidia上涨6.2%。这表明市场并未因他的言论而恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of those headlines being from Michael Burry who actually tweeted and called out some companies for the first time in a couple years specifically Meta, Oracle, and Nvidia saying that they have overstated their or sorry understated their depreciation which has allowed them to overstate their earnings. And then he's saying stay tuned for November 25th because things get worse. Don't know what that means. Is he launching a book? Is he putting out more analysis? But nonetheless, you have that headline there. Even that headline has not stopped the two big positions that he has a massive bearish bet against Palantir and Nvidia from going down. Palantir right there up 9% on the day and then Nvidia up 6.2%. Again, he does have close to a billion dollar notional **put position** (看跌期权头寸，一种金融衍生品，当标的资产价格下跌时，其持有者会获利) on these two companies. You're not seeing that type of pain.</p>
</details>

### 数据中心板块承压与财报预告

然而，并非整个市场都一片向好。一些领域正承受压力，特别是数据中心相关的股票。今天，Big Bear AI、Rigetti、Rocket Lab、ASTS、Terawolf、Plug和Oxy都将公布财报。在我持有的这些公司中，只有Rocket Lab。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it's not happening to the entirety of the market because you are getting some pain in a variety of areas. First of all, the earnings that we have today, Big Bear AI, Regetti, Rocket Lab, AS, Terowolf, Plug, and Oxy. The only one that I own out of these names are Rocket Lab. So, we're going to get all those earnings after the bell, and I'll put a poll right here in the chat on which one people think will outperform.</p>
</details>

数据中心概念股今天表现不佳，具体原因尚不明确。唯一可能的解释是**Hyperscalers**（超大规模数据中心提供商，指像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样能提供海量计算和存储能力的公司）承担的巨额债务，这可能影响了所有**Neoclouds**（新兴云服务商，通常指专注于特定领域，如AI计算，并挑战传统大型云服务商的公司）。Coreweave股价基本持平，Nebius也表现平平，IREN下跌3%，Cypher下跌4%。今天盘后，大型新兴云服务商Coreweave将公布财报，届时我们可以一探究竟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the data center plays haven't really done that well today. Honestly, I'm not sure exactly why. The only argument you can make is around the overall debt that these data centers or that the hyperscalers are taking on, which could be affecting all the Neoclouds. Coreweave right there basically flat. Nebius ended up going basically flat. IREN here down 3% of the day. All of them getting hit. Not exactly sure why. Cypher down 4%. Maybe it has to do with AI hyperscaler debt. Maybe there's something else going on but we will get one of the big neocloud earnings today after the bell with Coreweave.</p>

### Tom Lee 深度解析：AI 交易与基金经理困境

接下来我们听听Tom Lee今天下午的看法。

> **NBC Contributor:** 停摆结束带来了某种程度的宽慰，因为它夺走了我们对宏观数据的可见性，当然也对经济造成了冲击。
>
> **Interviewer:** 那么从现在到年底，AI交易似乎是争论的焦点。您对此有何看法？
>
> **Tom Lee:** 我认为AI的基本面依然非常良好。我们知道AI支出的可见性很高，模型仍在创新和功能增强。所以对我来说，回报仍在路上。投资者需要应对的一个问题是，尽管他们可能说AI股票昂贵，但Nvidia的远期市盈率仅为29倍，比Costco还便宜。这很难说是泡沫估值。
>
> **Interviewer:** 但我认为当他们谈论AI股票的估值时，不一定是指Nvidia，更多是像Palantir这样的公司。您可能会同意，这些公司的盈利和故事都很棒，但到某个点，你只愿意为一只股票支付某个价格。
>
> **Tom Lee:** 是的，我认为Palantir是一个所谓的“N=1”公司的例子。你有一个由创始人领导的企业，开发出对采用它的公司来说如同魔法般的产品。所以，它应该仅仅获得一个软件公司的估值吗？我不这么认为。Palantir正在开辟如此多的市场。人们在2018年也会对特斯拉说同样的话，因为它看起来贵得离谱，但此后特斯拉的股票表现非常出色。
>
> **Interviewer:** 那么您认为上周的市场波动核心是什么？
>
> **Tom Lee:** 核心是市场本身就会波动。当市场波动时，人们会做两件事：一是攻击领头羊，二是凸显了一个严峻的现实——我们即将迎来连续第三年的两位数增长。过去三年，S&P 500指数上涨了80%。而基金经理的业绩是按三年期衡量的，只有21%的基金经理在这三年期间跑赢了80%的涨幅。这对基金经理来说是有史以来最糟糕的时期之一。所以他们宁愿看到市场下跌，以便他们的表现能赶上来。我认为更有可能的是，市场会遵循季节性模式，这意味着年底前会有大量的追涨行为。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> NBC contributor: I think there's a certain measure of relief because the shutdown robbed us of visibility on the macro data and of course there's economic hit. So I think for many reasons I think this shutdown was a problem for investors.
>> So what about now between now and the end of the year? It's the AI trade that really seems to be debated. How do you feel about it heading into this final stretch?
>> Uh I think it's still in really good shape fundamentally. We know there's a lot of visibility for for AI spending and we know there's still innovation and gain of function taking place with the models. So it to me it makes sense that there's still a payoff coming. I think one of the issues that investors are going to grapple with is even though they may say AI uh stocks are expensive, Nvidia still only trades at 29 times Ford earnings. I mean it's still cheaper than Costco. So it's it's hardly a bubble valuation.
>> No, but I don't think when they talk about the valuation of AI stocks, they're necessarily talking about Nvidia. I think you would agree with me on that. They're more so talking about names like Palantir and some others where you could easily say, "Yes, the earnings have been great and the the story is incredible, but at some point you're only willing to pay X for a stock and maybe that one's gotten a little bit too rich."
>> Yeah. I mean, I think Palantir is an example of what they call like an N equals one company. You know, you've got a founder-led business developing products that really seem like magic for the companies that adopt it. So, you know, should this just be getting a software multiple? I don't think so. And, you know, Palantir's opening up so many markets. People would have said that about Tesla in 2018 because it looked incredibly expensive and the stock in Tesla has been a huge performer since then.
>> But what was last week about then do you think at its heart?
>> Well, I think at the heart is the market wobbles. And so when the market wobbles people do two things, you know, one is they start to take shots at the leaders, right? But the second it it really highlights the grim reality that we're about to have a third year of double digit gains. The S&P is up 80% over the past three years. And funds are measured on three-year performance. Only 21% of fund managers are beating 80% over that three-year period. It is one of the worst ever periods for fund managers. And so they'd rather see the market fall so that it falls to their performance level. I think what's more likely of course is the market follows a seasonal pattern which means there's going to be a lot of chasing into year end.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee的核心观点有三：首先，市场波动是正常现象，上周的下跌并无明确的核心利空。其次，他认为Palantir是独一无二的公司，其高估值并不意味着泡沫，就像2018年的特斯拉一样。最后，只有少数基金经理跑赢了市场基准，这意味着如果市场不下跌，他们将不得不追高，从而可能推动市场进一步上涨。政府停摆问题的缓解可能是吸引大资金重新入场的催化剂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A couple core arguments he made. Number one, market wobbles. It is what it is. And quite frankly, there wasn't a lot of reasons for why the market took as bad of a downturn as it did last week. The shutdown potentially being reversed caused the V-shape on Friday which then made it very clear that the market cares so much about the shutdown. In terms of Palantir, I thought what he said was also really important. Essentially saying that Palantir is a one of one company and that their products are like magic. You could have said the same argument about Tesla when it was worth 50 billion back in 2018 that it was egregiously overvalued and expensive, but that doesn't mean it's a bubble. He's basically highlighting Palantir as a core winner in the AI space. The market is siding on Palantir. This is obviously bigger money that's stepping in after the shutdown that's happy to start reallocating to equities, which goes to Tom Lee's third point, which is that only 23% of fund managers are meeting their benchmarks, which means they'd rather see the market go down so they can catch up. If the market doesn't go down, they have to chase. As an institutional money manager, you have a fiduciary duty to be able to beat the S&P 500. And if you're not at this point, then there might be some chasing that's going on right here.</p>

</details>

### 财报深度解读：Rocket Lab、Coreweave 与 Big Bear AI

**Rocket Lab** 的表现尤为亮眼。CEO Peter Beck表示，公司实现了创纪录的1.55亿美元营收和37%的毛利率。公司预计第四季度营收将达到1.8亿美元，毛利率维持在37-39%之间。更重要的是，其Neutron火箭计划取得进展，预计将于2026年第一季度运抵发射场。距离实现GAAP盈利仅一步之遥，这是一个非常激动人心的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Peter Beck, this past quarter we once again delivered record revenue at 155 million at record gap gross margins at 37%. Our momentum is strong and we're poised to deliver long-term exciting growth. Fourth quarter they're guiding for 180 million gap gross margins of 37 to 39. That's pretty incredible for a hardware intensive business like Rocket Lab. Updating our Neutron schedule that has a rocket arriving at Rocket Lab launch complex 3 in Q1 2026. With the first launch thereafter pending the successful completion of the vehicle's qualification testing and acceptance program.</p>
</details>

**Coreweave** 的CEO表示，公司第三季度业绩出色，营收创下新高，**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligations: 剩余履约义务，指已签约但尚未交付产品或服务的合同金额，是未来收入的领先指标）几乎翻倍，达到550亿美元。这反映了市场对GPU的巨大需求，对Nvidia、AMD等公司也是一个积极信号。然而，公司也提到由于第三方数据中心开发商的交付延迟，第四季度的预期将受到影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coreweave CEO: We've delivered an exceptional third quarter, setting new records for revenue and almost doubling our revenue backlog to more than 55 billion. Our performance reflects disciplined execution across every part of our business. Core's position as the essential cloud for AI has never been stronger. This is super bullish Nvidia, super bullish AMD. It means demand should be high.</p>
</details>

**Big Bear AI** 宣布将以2.5亿美元收购Ask Sage，一个专注于国防和国家安全领域的生成式AI平台。Ask Sage预计2025年的**ARR**（Annual Recurring Revenue: 年度经常性收入，衡量订阅制业务健康状况的关键指标）约为2500万美元，这意味着收购价是其预期销售额的10倍。公司将营收未达预期的部分原因归咎于政府停摆。尽管如此，由于业绩超出了华尔街的预期，其股价依然大幅上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We announced a definitive agreement to acquire Ask Sage, a fast growing generative AI platform for secure distribution of AI models and agentic AI capabilities built specifically for defense and national security agencies. Askage is expected to deliver annual recurring revenue of approximately 25 million in 2025, demonstrating a year-on-year increase of approximately six times their ARR. Big Bear is paying 250 million for a company doing 25 million. So, they're paying 10 times sales. Despite delays resulting from the government shutdown, we believe the potential for new businesses in the field of broader security and defense remains strong.</p>
</details>

### Coreweave 财报电话会议解析

在随后的电话会议中，Coreweave管理层详细阐述了业绩。CEO强调了公司在AI云平台领域的领先地位，客户需求远超供应能力。积压订单（backlog）从上一季度的300亿美元增至550亿美元，增长惊人。他还提到，公司正在与Meta、OpenAI以及一家领先的**hyperscaler**深化合作关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We continue to operate in a highly supply constrained environment where the demand for core best-in-class AI cloud platform far exceeds available capacity. This insatiable customer demand is a clear signal that the world's leading companies trust Coreweave to power their most critical AI workloads. In Q3, we beat expectations, delivering revenue of 1.4 billion, up 134% year-over-year. We added over 25 billion in revenue backlog in a third quarter alone, bringing us to over 55 billion in revenue backlog to end Q3, almost double Q2.</p>
</details>

然而，电话会议的焦点很快转向了供应链问题。管理层承认，由于一家第三方数据中心开发商的进度落后，导致交付出现“暂时性延迟”，这将影响第四季度的业绩。因此，公司将2025年全年营收指引调整为50.5亿至51.5亿美元。尽管他们强调受影响的客户已同意调整交付计划，合同总价值不受影响，但这一消息显然引发了市场的担忧。在整个电话会议期间，管理层多次被问及供应链瓶颈、产能扩张以及资金问题，其回应显得较为防御。市场似乎对公司需要承担更多债务来支持资本支出的前景感到不安，导致其股价在盘后交易中下跌超过5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In our case, we are affected by temporary delays related to a third-party data center developer who is behind schedule. This impacts fourth quarter expectations which Nitton will discuss shortly. With that backdrop, we now expect 2025 revenue in the range of 5.05 to 5.15 billion. The CFO said many times we are going to further increase our debt load to finance our demand-based capex. Now, the reason he's using that word demand-based capex is very intentional, right? He's trying to say, "Hey, the reason we're taking on more debt is because we have so much demand." Which is fine. It's just at the end of the day, that might not be something that the street cares that much about. Corey right here down 5.7%.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普最新言论及市场展望

在财报之外，前总统特朗普也举行了问答会。当被问及Marjorie Taylor Greene批评他过于关注外交而忽视国内问题（如物价上涨）时，特朗普回应称她“迷失了方向”，并强调总统必须处理全球事务以避免战争。他将话题转向自己的政绩，如减税法案和对华关税，认为这些举措最终有利于美国经济。然而，在面对关于生活成本和杂货价格的直接问题时，他并未正面回答，而是将讨论引向了其他领域，这表明“可负担性”问题可能成为其政府面临的一个挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Marjorie Taylor Green, who is a big ally of yours, said that she would rather see you focused on non-stop domestic policy meetings here at the White House instead of non-stop foreign policy meetings. What's your response to her saying that? And also, saying that grocery prices are up and not down as you've said. >> Yeah. So, I don't know what happened to Marie. She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think. But, I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally. I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. Objectively, he dodged the question about grocery prices because he knows at the end of the day grocery prices are up.</p>
</details>

总体而言，今天是一个由财报驱动的交易日。Rocket Lab和Big Bear AI的强劲表现提振了市场情绪，而Coreweave的指引问题则揭示了AI基础设施领域面临的现实挑战。市场的积极反弹表明，宏观层面的利好（如政府停摆结束）暂时盖过了对个别公司或行业的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overall I'm very happy as a Rocket Lab shareholder with that quarter. That was not a bad quarter by any sense of the imagination. Coreweave is the one that's getting hit the most after hours down 6.1%. Regardless of some of these earnings moves after hours, we did have a really good day and S&P 500 up one and a half%. Very nice to see 681.44. If we can continue that momentum. Again, all-time highs are 689. We are not that far away.</p>
