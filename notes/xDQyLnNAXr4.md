### 如何驾驭“黑暗对话”
>> Desmond O'Neal，对于刚点开这段对话的观众，他们能从我们的讨论中学到什么？

我在执法部门工作了30年，担任过许多不同的角色。在所有经历之上，我学到最重要的一点是：当压力巨大、情绪激动、事关重大时，你如何与他人进行真诚的连接和沟通？当对话轻松愉快，每个人都乐在其中时，你当然可以专注于握手、眼神交流和优雅的姿态。

但那些“黑暗对话”呢？那些盘踞在你脑海阴影里，你极力回避的对话呢？它们被太多的情绪或紧张气氛所笼罩，以至于你不知如何应对。我们每个人都会遇到这种情况，对吧？比如，我们觉得主管在晋升问题上忽视了我们；我们可能和配偶吵了一架；或者某个朋友背叛了我们。

那么，你该如何进行这样的对话？它具体是怎样的？在我从事这项工作的30年里，我交谈过的大多数人都不想和我说话。我的工作就是与他们建立连接，找到让他们敞开心扉的方法，达成某种理解，并获取我需要的信息。所以，这无关乎审讯或盘问，这关乎人与人之间的连接。

如果你的观众想知道如何进行一场“黑暗对话”，从而深化关系，或者至少达成某种共识，又或者最起码避免在事后反复回味自己说的每句话，琢磨哪里出了错、本可以怎样做得不同——如果他们有过这种经历并对此感兴趣，那么这里就是我们要探讨的内容。

<p class="english-text">>> Desmond O'Neal. For those people that have just clicked onto this conversation, what are they going to walk away from our discussion with? So I've been in law enforcement for 30 years and I've served a lot of different roles in that. And above everything else, the one thing that I've learned is when stress is high, when emotions are strong, when it matters, how do you authentically connect and communicate with somebody else? There's something to be said about when a conversation is easy, right? When it's fun, when everybody wants to be there, you can focus on your handshake. You can focus on the eye contact, how great your posture is. What about the dark conversations? What about those conversations that kind of they live in the shadows of your mind because you don't want to face them. You don't want to have those, right? They're they're cloaked in so much emotion or so much tension that you just you don't know how to handle that. We all have that, right? We have a supervisor who we feel is overlooking us in a promotion. We have, you know, a family member who we feel that we're just no longer getting along with. Maybe our spouse we got in a fight with. Maybe a friend who's betrayed us. So, how do you have that conversation? Like, what does that look like? Because it comes from, you know, for the 30 years that I've been doing this, most of the people that I talked to didn't want to talk to me. And my job was to connect with them, to find a way to get them to open up, to find a way to have some type of understanding and get the information that I needed. So, this is not about interview or interrogation. This is this is human connection. If your audience cares to understand how to have a dark conversation where you can deepen that relationship or at least come to some type of understanding or at the very least not walk away ruminating on everything you said trying to figure out what went wrong, what could you have done different? If you've had that and you're interested in knowing, then this is this is where we're going to talk about that.</p>

### 从狱警到特勤局审讯专家的演变
>> 能否用30秒总结一下，为什么你是传递这些信息的最佳人选？你的哪些经验和背景为你将要给观众提供的答案和可操作建议提供了支撑？

我的职业生涯始于一名狱警，后来成为一名警察，也曾是**特种武器和战术部队**（SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics，美国警察部门中的精英战术单位）的一员。之后我进入了联邦政府，加入了特勤局。在特勤局，我还开始了我的**测谎仪**（Polygraph: 一种通过监测生理指标来判断被测试者是否说谎的设备）职业生涯。所以，现在我面对的是那些向我倾诉他们最深、最黑暗秘密的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> And to summarize in I guess 30 seconds why you're the guy that is best placed to deliver this information, what is what are the reference points, the experiences, the the variety of experience you've had that feeds into the answers and the actionable advice you want to give my audience? My initial career started as a corrections officer, became a police officer and I was a SWAT officer as well. From there I went to the federal government. So I went to the secret service. Uh with the secret service I also started a polygraph career. So now I have people that are giving me their deepest, darkest secrets.</p>
</details>

>> 为了让大家了解背景，测谎是一种测谎测试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And just for context, polygraphing is a lie detection test.</p>
</details>

测谎是一种测谎测试。它能根据某人对特定问题的回答，给出心理或生理上的反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Polygraph is a lie detection test. So it gives you a psychological or a physiological response in terms of how somebody answers a particular question.</p>
</details>

>> 在那之后，你的职业生涯又走向了何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Where else did your career take you after that point?</p>
</details>

我进入了内部事务部门，负责监督我们组织内部的人员。所以现在我交谈的对象是那些接受过我的一些审讯培训的男女同事。他们大致了解正在进行的提问方式，也了解这种互动。他们自己也进行过面谈和审讯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I went into internal affairs and so that is now policing the people within our organization. So now I'm talking to men and women who have had some of my interrogation training. They kind of know the questioning going on. They know the interaction. They've done themselves interviews and interrogations.</p>
</details>

>> 哦，好的。所以这些人是犯了罪或有某种不当行为，或者被举报了的执法人员，而你的工作就是调查他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, okay. So this is law enforcement officers who have committed a crime or some kind of mis issue or been reported for something and your job is to investigate them.</p>
</details>

是的。但你想想看，你现在交谈的对象，可能一年前还和你一起在街上并肩工作，而现在你却要就某些指控向他们提出问题或要求澄清。你必须非常谨慎地处理这种情况，这非同小可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. But think about that for a minute. like you're now talking to somebody else who, you know, maybe a year ago you were out in the street doing work with and now you're asking them these questions or these for clarification on some type of allegation. You got to be you got to be mindful with that. Like that's a big deal.</p>
</details>

>> 你觉得当时流行的面谈方法已经过时了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And the the interview methods that were prevalent at that time you felt were outdated.</p>
</details>

确实如此。在美国，面谈和审讯的演变有着非常悠久的历史。它始于20世纪初警察制度出现时。在那种情况下，存在身体虐待，他们称之为“三级审讯”，你会进去，然后人们可能会磨掉你的牙齿，或者通过制造痛苦让你开口。

随着我们社会的发展，这种情况开始消失，取而代之的是心理操纵。所以，重点不再是动手，而是更多地从心理层面让人们与你交谈。大约在2014年我进入内部事务部门时，我就觉得，斯蒂芬，一定有别的方法。我们在这方面肯定已经有所进化。

大约在那个时候，我被海军研究生院录取攻读硕士学位。因为我正在寻找一种更好的面谈方式，我的一位论文导师说：“嘿，你听说过**高价值被拘留者审讯小组**（HIG: High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group，一个专注于审讯高价值目标的美国政府跨部门小组）吗？”我从未听说过，但HIG在创建时是三管齐下的，它有一个研究部门，一个实践者部门，也就是执行审讯的人员，还有一个培训师部门。

培训师部门的我们，会进行面谈和审讯，但我们也理解其背后的科学原理。这一点之所以重要，是因为你可能是一个非常优秀的实践者，却不明白为什么某些方法有效或无效。因此，能够跨越科学与实践之间的桥梁，理解科学并将其应用到审讯室中——这种混合、这种连接、这个最佳结合点，就是我所做的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> They were. So there is in the US there's a very historical evolution of interview and interrogation. You know, it started in the 1900s when policing came in. In that circumstance, it was physical abuse. They called it the third degree where you would go in and, you know, people would grind down your teeth or they would cause pain for you to talk to them. As we've evolved as a society, that started to go away in lie of psychological manipulation. So, it was less about hands-on and more about trying to get people to talk to you from a psychological perspective. And right about 2014 when I went into internal affairs, I was like, Stephen, I was like, I just there's got to be something different. Like, we've had to evolved in some way in terms of what that is. And so, you know, you have my thesis there, right? Right about that time, I was accepted into the Naval Postgraduate School to pursue a masters. And because I was looking for a better way to interview, one of my thesis advisors said, "Hey, have you ever heard of the highvalue detainee interrogation group, which the acronym is HIG?" Had never heard of it, but the HIG when it was created was was three-prong, meaning that it had a a research department, right? And it had a practitioner department, so the people that would do the the the interrogations. And then it had a trainer department. Now the trainer department, we would do interviews, interrogations, but we also understood the science behind that. The reason that's important is because you could be a really good practitioner and not understand why something is or isn't working. And so being able to cross the bridge between the the science and understanding that and being able to apply it in the room, that hybrid, that connection, that sweet spot, that is what I did.</p>

### 艰难对话的第一步：放弃贴标签
>> 所以，如果我有一场艰难的对话要进行，对方充满敌意，经常对我进行煤气灯操控，甚至可能是个自恋者。当我走进这场对话，或者我正在过度思考它，想着“天啊，我必须进行这场对话”，我应该从哪里开始？

我建议的第一个起点是，不要像你刚才那样给对方贴标签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, if I'm, you know, I've got a difficult conversation I want to have with someone, this person is antagonistic, they often gaslight me, they might be a narcissist, and I'm walking into that conversation or, you know, I'm overthinking it. I'm thinking, "God, I need to have this conversation." Where's the first place to start? So the first place that I would start is don't label the people how you just label them.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay.</p>
</details>

那是个问题。你刚刚给某人贴上了自恋者的标签。为什么这对你很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And that's a problem. So you just labeled somebody a narcissist. Why does that matter to you?</p>
</details>

>> 我想这让我可以责备他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think it allows me to blame them. I guess</p>
</details>

让你能够责备，但从你的角度看，什么是自恋者？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> allows you to blame but but tell me tell me in your perspective what's a narcissist?</p>
</details>

>> 他们缺乏同理心，以自我为中心，可能还有点攻击性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That they are they are low empathy. They are self-centered. They are a little bit aggressive maybe.</p>
</details>

好的，我们先停在这里。你个人认为，在你的生活中，有没有缺乏同理心的时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So let's stop there. Do you think personally that there are times in your life where you lack empathy?</p>
</details>

>> 有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

好的。所以同理心是高度情境化的，也是主观的。这意味着，如果你觉得这个人没有给予你足够的同理心，好吧，也许他有点自我为中心，有点攻击性。我问你这些的原因是，如果你公然给某人贴上“这个人是自恋者”的标签，你就为自己省事了。你把责任推给了他们，但你将无法真正理解这个人是谁，以及他们为什么会是这个样子。所以，我要做的第一件事就是，在你进入对话时，去掉你给他们下的定义和标签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So empathy is very situationally based. So meaning that it's also subjective. Meaning if you feel this person is not giving you certain empathy, okay, maybe um a bit self-centered, a bit aggressive, you the reason I ask you these things is because if you just blatantly label somebody as being like this person's a narcissist, you've just you've just made it easy for yourself. You've just put blame on them and you're not going to be able to really understand who this person is and and why they are the way they are. So the first thing that I would do is I would take away the labels as how you define them as you're going into that.</p>
</details>

### PLAN 框架：驾驭黑暗对话的四个步骤
当你需要进入一场“黑暗对话”时，有四件事可以帮助你保持参与和投入。我们称之为需要一个“PLAN”计划，这是一个首字母缩写词：P、L、A、N。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, when you need to go into a dark conversation, here are the four things that you can do to stay engaged and involved in in in what's about to happen, right? And in how this is going to hopefully go through. And what we say is you need to have a plan. And there's the acronym about that, P, right? L A N.</p>
</details>

#### P 代表目的 (Purpose)
P代表目的（Purpose）。目的是你为什么在那里？原因是什么？任务是什么？你必须理解你的任务，因为你的任务将驱动你的策略。你的任务将决定当事情偏离轨道时你该如何应对。如果这个人变得有攻击性，开始侮辱你，而你此刻的任务是深化与他们的对话和关系，那么你的任务应该让你保持在正轨上，因为你很容易被拉偏。

有一种叫做**多重目标理论**（Multiple Goals Theory: 该理论认为在任何沟通互动中，人们会同时追求多个目标，如任务目标、身份目标和关系目标）的理论。它指的是在任何特定时间，我们会同时追求多个目标。通常这些目标会包括任务导向的，比如我想完成一项任务。其中也会有身份认同的成分，即我感觉如何？在此过程中我的情绪是怎样的？然后还有关系层面的，即我与这个人的关系。

很多时候，在多重目标理论中，这些目标可以保持一致。举个例子，比如你在参加一项体育运动，你在一个团队里。团队的目标，也就是任务，是赢得比赛，比对方得分更多。身份认同方面则是：我是一个好球员吗？我想要球吗？我拿到球了吗？我是否在做贡献？我是超级巨星吗？这其中有某种身份认同，以及作为一名体育明星的感觉如何。关系部分则是我的队友对我的感觉如何？我是一个好队友吗？

这些目标可以是一致的。但当目标不一致时，你就会看到问题。比如突然有人成了我们所说的“球霸”，总是自己投篮，不传球，你就会想：“你在干什么？”在这种情况下，你更关心的是自己的身份认同，而不是团队的胜利。这就是问题所在，是目标不一致的体现。

一个更简单的例子是，假设你和老板或同事在一个非常重要的会议上，试图敲定一笔交易，而你的老板说错了话。现在你必须做出决定。你要么当着所有人的面纠正你的老板，要么维护他或她的尊严，稍后再处理。你必须决定哪一个更重要。你必须明白你参加那个会议的目的。也许我可以放过这个小错误，因为它没那么重要。因为如果我纠正了老板，这可能会影响我之后与他们的关系，甚至可能因为被调离或无法参与项目而毁掉我的职业生涯。

所以，在审视目标时，你必须明白总体的目标是什么。尤其是在情绪化的对话中，斯蒂芬，我们真的很容易分心，非常容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the P is for purpose. And the purpose is why are you there? What's the reason? What's the mission? You have to understand your mission because your mission is going to drive your tactics. Your mission is going to determine if things get off track. If this person becomes aggressive, this person starts to be insulting. If my mission at that moment is to deepen my conversation with them and deepen my relationship in some way, and this starts to get ugly in the middle, your mission should keep you on track because you can get pulled from that very quickly. There's something called multiple goals theory. And multiple goals theory is the understanding that at any given time we will pursue simultaneous goals. And typically those goals would be something task oriented. You know I want to I want to finish a tasking. I want to get something done. There's going to be a component of identity in there meaning that how do I feel? What are my emotions going on during the course of this? And then there's going to be relational. So it's going to be my relationship with this person at the time. Now, a lot of times within multiple goals theory, those things can align. So, and I'll give you example like if you're playing a sport, you're on a team. Uh the team goal, your goal within that team, the task is to win, to put on more points than the other person. That's the task. The identity aspect of that is am I a good player? Do do I want the ball? Do I get the ball? Am I contributing? Am I the superstar? Is there some type of identity and how this makes me feel about myself being being a sports star in some capacity? And the relationship part of that is how do my teammates feel about me? Am I inter am I a good teammate in terms of what that was? Those things can align. You can see when that is misaligned when all of a sudden somebody what they would call a ball hog, somebody takes the shot all the time or they won't pass it around and you're like what are you doing? Right? And it's one of these things where like you are more concerned about your identity than you are about the team winning. That's a problem. That's when you can see there's a misalignment of goals. Or something that's even more simple would be let's say you're in a meeting with uh a boss or a colleague and it's a pretty important meeting. You're you're trying to close a deal and your boss says something that's wrong. Now you have to make a decision. You could either correct your boss in front of everybody or you could preserve his or her dignity and address them at a later time. You have to decide which one of those is most important. You have to understand your purpose of being in that meeting because maybe I could let this go. It's not that big of a deal because if I correct my boss, this may affect my relationship with them at a later time. This could ruin my career in terms of being transferred or or not being on a project. So when you're looking at goals, you have to understand what the overall objective is. It becomes Stephen, it becomes, especially in emotional conversations, it becomes really easy to to get distracted. Really easy.</p>

#### 案例：在极端压力下坚守目的
为了说明坚守目的的重要性，我分享一个故事。1991年，一个名叫JC Duggard的11岁女孩被一个叫Philip Gerrio和他的妻子Nancy绑架了。他们囚禁了JC 18年，期间Philip还与她生了两个孩子。2009年，他们被找到并逮捕。

然而，在此案三年前，另一个县有一个名叫Michaela Garrett的女孩失踪了，一直没有找到。很多人怀疑也是Philip干的。我的一位同事是当地的检察官，他希望我能去审问Philip，以了解真相。

我研究了Philip的所有资料，包括他写的一份关于如何治愈恋童癖的宣言。我对同事说，我需要四天时间。我的目标是深入了解他所做的一切，他是一个连环强奸犯、连环绑架犯，并试图弄清在Michaela失踪期间他的生活轨迹。

我见到他时，他问我是谁。我自我介绍后，他说天使告诉他这次谈话会是好的。于是我们每天谈话八到九个小时，持续了四天。在这期间，他多次表现出攻击性、居高临下，称我是骗子，质疑我的诚信。

我本可以反击他：“你绑架了一个11岁的女孩，囚禁了她18年，还和她生了两个孩子，现在你来质疑我的诚信？”但我没有那么做，因为那不是我来的目的。我的目的是查明真相。尽管他发怒，指责我各种事情，我始终坚守我的任务。

谈话结束后，我告诉检察官：“他不是你们要找的人。”他问我是否确定，我说：“我以我的职业生涯担保。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll share the story with you. In 1991, an 11-year-old girl named JC Duggard was kidnapped by a man named Philip Gerrio and his wife Nancy. And Philip and Nancy kept JC Duggard for 18 years. He fathered two children with her. In 2009, they found her and him at Berkeley. They arrested him, arrested his wife. Three years prior to that, there was a young girl named Michaela Garrett who had gone missing, never been found in a county over. There was a lot of suspicion that Philillip was the one who did this as well. And one of my one of my colleagues was the prosecuting attorney. His name is Vern Pearson. And Vern said, I'd like to close this or get some type of understanding. Can you go and interview Philip? So I looked at all the information on Philip. He had written a manifesto in terms of how to cure pedophilia. And I went to Vern. I said, "All right, I'm let's go do this and he goes, "What do you need like a day, a couple of hours?" And I said, "I need four days." And my goal was to do a deep dive into the things that he had done. He was a a serial rapist, uh, a serial kidnapper, and to understand his life in the time frame by which Michaela Garrett went missing. So I show up, he walks in, says, "Who are you?" I said, "Well, I'm special agent O'Neal. I'd like to talk to you about um your history. I read your manifesto and I had some questions. And he said, you know, uh, when they told me I had a visitor, he goes, I wasn't going to come in. He goes, but the angels on my shoulder tell me that this would be a good good talk. So he said, let's do it. We talked in detail every day for probably 8 to nine hours. In the course of those 36 hours. Multiple times he was very aggressive. He was very condescending. He called me a liar. Things he accused me of you. I don't believe you are who you say you are. I don't believe you're here for the things you're saying you're here for. Um I don't even know if he worked for the federal government. And he's essentially questioned my integrity. Now, my purpose is not to make him feel that I'm smarter than him. Is not to belittle or berate him or or have a a question of, you know, integrity. Cuz I could have said, "You kidnapped an 11-year-old girl and kept her captive for 18 years, fathered two children with her, the first one at the age of 14." and your question of my integrity. I didn't do that because that's not why I was there. And so despite the fact that he got upset, despite the fact that he called me and accused me of all these different things, I stayed on my purpose. I stayed on my mission. And when we were done, when we finished, I went back to the prosecuting attorney and said, "He's not your guy." And he said, "Are you sure?" And I said, "I bet my career on it."</p>

<p class="english-text">>> How did you know?</p>
</details>

当你从说真话的角度审视人们时，有很多关于他们说话和与你互动方式的线索。我们周二、周三、周四和周五的对话内容都保持了高度的一致性。如果我要求他进一步澄清，他会提供。如果他谈到某件事时，会自发地纠正自己，比如“等等，这件事发生在那件事之前”，这些都是诚实的迹象。

说真话的人通常会谈论事情的复杂性，因为没有谁的一天是完美无缺的。他讲述的犯罪经历中，也包含了很多不顺利的复杂情况。而说谎的人通常不会引入这些复杂性。总的来说，我们的谈话中没有出现围绕Michaela Garrett失踪时间的重大空白或奇怪之处。没有欺骗的线索。

后来，他们回去重新检查证据，发现了一个新的指纹，最终得以起诉并定罪了真正的罪犯。我之所以提起这一切，是因为它关乎我们所谈论的目的。不偏离你的任务，专注于目标。沟通的力量在于，它能让你保持在正轨上，让你保持专注，并提醒你为什么在这里。

<p class="english-text">There's a lot of things in regards to when you're looking at people from the perspective of telling the truth in terms of the way that they they talk and engage with you. Our conversation on Tuesday and our conversation on Wednesday and our conversation on Thursday and our conversation on Friday all stayed very consistent. If I'm asking him for further clarification, he's providing for further clarification. If I'm talking to him about, you know, something and there's some type of spontaneous correction where he's like, "Wait a minute. This happened uh before this, those are those are indicators of of truth. And if there are things that you know, he he talks about in terms of like things that are of complication. Nobody's day goes perfect." When complications are introduced to a story, right, people who lie don't do that, right? It's truth tellers will often do that because it's just like this is just what happened. Overall, in terms of how that conversation went, there were those type of indicators that just made it trend more truthful than not. like there wasn't this big gap or this big weird moment when we're talking about Michaela Garrett to where all of a sudden it's like missing pieces that I have to put in there. There are no cues to deception. They found a new fingerprint and were able to um charge and convict uh the person who did that. The reason I bring all of that up is because for the purpose aspects of what we're talking about, not losing sight of what your mission is, being focused in terms of what that is. The power of communication and staying online as it relates to what you want to accomplish is really powerful because it keeps you on track and it keeps you engaged and reminds you of why you're there.</p>

#### L 代表倾听 (Listen)
L代表倾听（Listen）。这是人们最不擅长的事情，因为它需要做很多工作。想一下我们此刻的对话。我正在说话，我脑中的内部词汇和对话以每分钟800到1000个词的速度运行。而我跟你说话的速度大约是每分钟120到150个词。这中间有很多内容被编辑掉了。

同时，我还在运用**心智理论**（Theory of Mind: 指理解他人心理状态——如信念、意图、欲望、假装、知识等——并认识到这些心理状态与自己不同的能力），观察你，试图理解我所说的是否符合你的期望。如果你的非语言或语言行为发生变化，我就必须重新调整。

与此同时，你也在听我说话，你的大脑能以每分钟400到600个词的速度处理信息。所以你有太多的认知带宽，可以一边听我说话，一边做其他事情。这就是为什么人们常常会走神。你必须进行所谓的**认知抑制**（Cognitive Inhibition: 指抑制无关信息或冲动反应，以便专注于当前任务的能力），收窄你的带宽，以保持完全的专注。这就是为什么“积极倾听”很难做到。

史蒂芬·柯维（Stephen Covey）曾说：“大多数人倾听的目的不是为了理解，而是为了回应。”如果你只是在等待自己说话的机会，那么我们之间就没有真正的连接。控制对话来自于倾听，而不是说话。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So the L is listen this becomes the thing that people are worst at because it's a lot to do. Think about right now think about my conversation with you at this moment. I'm speaking so internally my internal vocabulary and the conversation that I'm having in my head is running about 800 to a,000 words a minute. I'm speaking to you in about 120 to 150 words a minute. There's a lot that's being edited. There's also something called theory of mind, which is me watching you and trying to understand is what I'm saying on point with what Stephen wants to hear or wants to hear for his audience. Do I need to change anything? Simultaneously, you are listening to me and you're listening to the 120 to 150 words I'm giving you, but your brain can process this at like 4 to 600 words per minute. So, you have too much cognitive bandwidth. you have the ability to listen to me and then do multiple other things which is oftentimes why people will drift out or you'll start thinking of something else. so you actually have to do something called cognitive inhibition you have to kind of narrow that bandwidth to stay fully engaged with me that's why when you hear people say like active listening it's hard it's hard to do because you have to be attentive to the other person. You have to listen. You have to look. You have to pick up their verbal and their non-verbal behavior. And you then you have to do something with that. Steven CVY says most people don't listen with the intent to understand. They listen with the intent to reply. And if you are simply just waiting for your turn to talk, then you and I are not are not connecting. Controlling conversation comes from listening, not talking.</p>

#### A 代表提问 (Ask)
A代表提问（Ask）。如果你在专心听我说话，并注意到我言语或身体语言的变化，而有些地方你不理解，你就需要提问。这是你深化对话的地方，也是你向对方展示你正在积极倾听、充满好奇、思想开放并试图理解他们的地方。

关于**共情准确性**（Empathy Accuracy: 指准确推断他人想法和感受的能力）的研究显示，我们通常高估了自己理解伴侣或他人的能力。对于一个陌生人，你理解他们内心世界的准确率大约是20%。对于一个亲近的朋友，是30%。而对于你的另一半，最高也不超过40%。这意味着，尽管你认为你知道她在想什么，你也只有四成的机会猜对。

如果对话变得情绪化，那40%的准确率可能会降到15%，因为你会开始自我防卫。当你的自尊心受到威胁时，你的耳朵就会“下线”，因为你不再听对方在说什么，而是开始保护自己。

所以，提问的力量至关重要。比如，你早上锻炼回来，你的配偶问：“嘿，斯蒂芬，锻炼得怎么样？”你说：“挺累的。”“累”这个词很模糊。她可以什么都不说，也可以猜测说：“亲爱的，这就是你身材这么好的原因。”但最好的方式是问：“你说的‘累’是什么意思？”通过提问，她向你表明：“我关注你，我在倾听。”这正是深化关系、增进连接的方式。

身体语言也是如此。我们传递的信息中有66%是非语言的。如果在对话中，我看到你交叉双臂、翻白眼，如果这对我来说很重要，我就需要说出来。可以说：“看起来……”而不是“我认为……”，因为“我认为”是以自我为中心。可以说：“我注意到当我提到我们家里的事时，你向后靠了靠，交叉了双臂，还翻了个白眼。看起来你不太赞同。我说的对吗？”现在，决定权就在你手上，你可以解释，也可以不解释。

<p class="english-text">The next thing you have to do which gets into this is the A which is which is ask. Right? If you are paying attention to me and you're picking up on things that I'm saying, the changes in my body language, and there's something you don't understand, you need to ask. This is where you're going to deepen the conversation. This is where you show somebody that you're active listening. you're curious and you're open and you're trying to understand them. If you look at empathy research, we typically think that we can understand our significant other or different people at a much higher level than we actually do. For a stranger, it's called it's called empathy accuracy. For a stranger, your ability to understand their headsp space is like 20%. For a friend, somebody close to you, it's like 30. For your significant other, it's no higher than 40%. Which means that despite you thinking that you know what she's thinking, you got a four out of 10 chance of being right. And if that conversation gets emotional, that 40% can go down as low as 15 because you start to pull in to be like, I I'm I'm guarding myself here. I'm guarding my ego. When your ego is on the line, your ears go offline because you stop hearing what she's having to say and you start protecting yourself in terms of what you're trying to do. Let's say you come home from early morning workout and your spouse says, "Hey Stephen, uh, how was it?" And you say, "That's pretty tough." The third thing she could say would be like, "What do you mean by tough?" Because the ambiguity of that is the word tough. She's now showing you, "I'm into you. I'm tuning in." In the power of something like that, when you talk about deepening relationships and increasing that connection, that's how it happens. The same thing with your non-verbal behavior, right? You look at non-verbal behavior, 66% of of what we give is non-verbal. And so if I see that and it matters to me, then I need to say something to the effect of it seems like versus I think because I think is the pronoun saying it's about me. It seems like what you just did maybe was because you didn't like what I had to say because I saw you cross your arms and roll your eyes. Do I have that right? So now you have a choice where you can either say you yes you got that right for these reasons or no.</p>

#### N 代表下一步 (Next Steps)
N代表下一步（Next Steps）。制定计划意味着要理解所有这些不同的方面以及你处理它们的方式。而“下一步”则是你希望如何解决这个问题？最终目标是什么？有什么我能做的，能让我们双方达成一致，让我们的关系更进一步吗？

我总是会问对方。回到你可能要和那个你称之为“自恋者”的人进行的对话。如果你是主动发起对话并希望找到解决方案的一方，你就必须询问是否存在解决方案。可以这样说：“你觉得我们能找到一种友好的方式向前走吗？这样我们互动时，可以真正享受彼此的时光，而不会让事情变得糟糕。你觉得我们的未来有可能实现这一点吗？”

如果答案是肯定的，那么就继续问：“那对我们来说具体是怎样的？我们该如何实现？”因为你进行这场对话是因为你重视与他的关系。没有能让每场对话都完美的灵丹妙药。你和对方都是对话的一部分，各有各的观点。最难的是在事后感到本可以做得更多。而力量在于知道如何去处理它。如果结果不尽如人意，你也能坦然走开，对自己说：“好吧，事情就是不顺利，但我可以接受。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The N which is the next steps. So to have a plan means to understand all of these different things and the way that you approach that. And the next steps is how do you want to resolve this? Like what's the end goal with this? Is there anything that I can do that we can you know further our relationship where both you and I can can be in alignment. I would always ask them if I'm engaged. Right. So perhaps let's go back to the the conversation that you may have with you know this this individual. or you're just like this person's a narcissist and so forth. If you're engaging them and you're the one who wants to really have this conversation and you're hoping that you can find some type of resolution, you have to ask if there's resolution with that. So something to the effect of, do you think that you and I can find an amicical way forward where when I when you and I engage, you know, we can really enjoy each other's time and and this thing not go bad. Like do you see that in our future at all? Yes or no? And then it's either yes. Okay. What does that look like for us? Like how do we have that? because I am I'm having this conversation with you because my relationship with you matters, but there are things that happen within that are that are frustrating and that cause me not to really want to engage. I do want to find a way to do that because that is most important to me. How best do we do that? There is no magic bullet by which makes everything every conversation go perfect. There's none. You are you are part of that conversation. The other person is part of that conversation. You have your perspective. They have their perspective. The hardest part is to walk away and feeling like you should there should have done more you can do. The power becomes knowing how to address that. And if it doesn't go right then you walk away and be like you know what it just didn't go right and I'm okay with that.</p>

</details>

那么，关键就在于当场指出她的无礼行为。要非常具体地说明是什么。如果你只是说“你很粗鲁”，而她反问“我做了什么？”，你又说“你就是很粗鲁”，这样是没用的。要给她具体的背景，说明你为什么觉得她粗鲁。

你可以说：“嘿，我注意到你现在非常居高临下，还给我起了个外号。你能具体解释一下为什么会这样吗？”让她为自己的行为辩护。让她解释到底是什么问题。你可以问：“你是不是对我有意见？或者对我的工作态度不满？你在这里比我久，也许我做错了什么你认为不妥当的事？因为我真的不理解你的愤怒、你的恶意以及你侮辱我的必要性，我真心想弄明白。”

你正在和她进行一场非常直接的对话，具体到她所说的话。这并不意味着问题会得到解决，她可能就是个混蛋。但关键在于，你要去处理这个问题，而不是以牙还牙。你不必变成和她一样的人。你可以从那场对话中走出来，对自己说：“我尽力处理好了。”

Like, you know, if she if she calls you and she uses, you know, she calls you a name or whatever the case may be, like, you know what, you're being rude. and she's just like, "What did I do?" And you're like, "You're just being rude." That's unhelpful. Like, give her the context by which you feel that she's being rude. And I would say, "Hey, it seems like as of right now, like, you know, you're very condescending. You've called me a name to include an Can you explain to me specifically right now why that is?" and make her back it up. Make her explain to you what it is that is there something about is there something about me you don't like? Is there something about my my work ethic that you don't like or maybe the way that I'm doing this? You've been here longer than me. So is perhaps there's something else that I'm doing or not doing that you think is wrong because I am not understanding your anger and your venom and your need to insult me and I would really try to understand what that is. So, you're having a very direct conversation with her, very specific to what she's saying. It does not mean that that's going to fix it. She could just be an And it's one of those things where you have to be like, I am going to address this. I'm not going to return in kind. I don't have to turn into that person as well. I can walk away from that conversation and be like, you know what, I handled that the best I could.</p>

### 警惕“唯我综合症”
>> 我听你说过，人们患有“唯我综合症”（me me syndrome）。这是什么意思？

“唯我综合症”就是一切都围绕着“我”。尤其在西方**尊严文化**（Dignity Culture: 一种文化类型，其中个体的内在价值和自我价值感是核心，不依赖于他人的看法）中，我们非常关注自我，关注我们内在的感受。一切都取决于我们的工作、我们的成功。

问题在于，我们做了大量的自我反思，却很少向外反思他人。一些最优秀的谈判者会花一半以上的时间去思考对方。

我分享一个非常私人的故事。我21岁时，父亲因癌症去世了。当时我和四个兄弟姐妹都在家。几年后，我们一起回忆父亲去世那天。我姐姐说：“我一看《辛普森一家》就会想起爸爸。”我问她为什么，她说：“当时电视开着，正在播《辛普森一家》。”我当时非常惊讶：“房间里有电视吗？”我完全不记得房间里有电视，那不是我当时注意到的重点。

她对那个时刻的视角和看法，与房间里其他所有人都不同。所以，回到“唯我综合症”，当你没有考虑到其他人基于他们感知世界的方式而有不同的经历，当你认为一切都只与你有关时，你就很难与他人建立深刻、真诚、有连接的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I've heard you say that you think people suffer from me me syndrome. What does that mean? So the me me syndrome is everything everything is about me right I mean it seems obvious with that but like you can even look at things from like a cultural perspective you can look at like here you know in in the US in western civilizations like we are primarily like a dignity culture where we are it's all about us right it's all about that internal that internal feeling that that we have and so everything is predicated on our job our success the things that we do. The problem that I see and what I think comes with in communication is we do a lot of self-reflection. We rarely do a lot of outward reflection on the other person. Some of the best negotiators there will spend more than half of their time thinking about somebody else. So, a very personal story. Um, when I was 21, my father passed away. Several years later, uh, I'm having this conversation on the day that my dad died about the day that my dad died. I'm having this with my my sister and my three younger brothers and we're talking about where we were and so forth. And my sister says, "Yeah, I I can't watch the Simpsons without thinking of of dad." And I said, "What do you what do you mean?" She's like, "Well, the the the TV was there and the Simpsons were on." And she's like, "I always just remember that." And I was like, "There's a there's a TV in the room?" She's like, "You don't remember a TV being in the room?" And I'm like, "I have absolutely not. I have no idea that there's a TV in the room. I didn't code it. that wasn't the thing that was important. Her perspective and the way that she saw that moment affected her differently than everybody else in that room. And so to go back to the me me, when you fail to take in consideration that other people have other experiences based on how they pick up the world, how they do things in the world, and you think that it's just about you, you're you are going to have a really hard time having a deep, honest, connective relationship with somebody if it's just about you.</p>

### 操控与影响的区别
>> 操控（manipulation）和影响（influence）之间有什么区别？

影响是指在某个特定时间，以对你和对方都有利的方式，将一个人推向某个方向。这就是影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And what's the difference between manipulation and influence? Influence is about nudging a person in a certain direction at a certain time that's beneficial for both you and them. That's influence.</p>
</details>

操控则是你将一个人推向某个特定方向，因为这对你有好处，但对他们没有。所以你会撒谎，会不择手段地去达成交易，让他们做某事或给你某物。这就是操控，因为它通常会对被操控者产生负面后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Manipulation is you nudging a person in a specific direction because it's good for you. It's not good for them. And so you'll lie. You'll you'll do whatever you need to do to to close a deal to get them to do something to give them to give you something. That's manipulation because it's often one of those things that it has negative consequences to it in terms of the person who did it.</p>
</details>

>> 所以你认为撒谎是区分两者的关键时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so you're saying lying is the the the moment where it becomes manipulation.</p>
</details>

是的。撒谎成了一条捷径。如果你想影响某人，你应该对他们诚实、清晰和透明。因为影响关乎我如何看待你这个人，而不是你在那一刻所做的所有事情。如果我从一开始就不信任你，你就无法影响我。

如果我在我所做的一切中都对你诚实，因为这就是我的为人处世之道，这不仅能降低你的认知负荷，因为它让你不必对别人撒谎，而且还强调了你的立场和你的为人。人们会看到这一点，并说：“斯蒂芬非常透明。他说这是一个好交易，我相信他。”这在于你是否诚实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. that becomes the shortcut and that becomes a way not just within the interrogation room like I think what becomes important and I've seen this come up a lot people are all about like influence like you hear that come up quite a bit if you want to influence somebody this is how you do it you're honest with them you're clear and you're transparent because influence is about how do I feel about you not about all the things that you're doing at that moment because if I don't if trusted is isn't even on the table if I don't trust you to begin with or I think that to go back to what you had said there's this pattern recognition where I'm like I just think there's something wrong with this. You're not going to be able to influence me if I am honest with you in everything that I do because that's how I carry myself. Not only does it lower your cognitive load because you're not lying to somebody else, but it underscores who you stand for and who you are as a person. And with that, people are going to see that and say, you know what, Stephen's very transparent. He said this was a good deal and I believe that for these reasons. It's a matter of you being honest with that.</p>
</details>

### 如何建立信任
>> 信任是关于变得脆弱，关于开放和分享一些关于你自己的事情。

信任就像同心圆。最核心的圆环应该是自我信任。你应该比信任任何人都更信任自己。如果你做不到，你可能需要做些功课。这意味着你是否相信自己会做你想做或应该做的事？你是否能让自己负责？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So trust is about being vulnerable. Trust is about being open and sharing a little bit about yourself. When you talk about trust, I if you look at concentric rings, you know, in terms of the the trust around you, the the center ring should be selfrust. It should be you. You should be able to trust yourself more than you trust anybody else. If you don't, you probably need to do a little bit of work, right? What does that mean in reality of me trusting myself? Do you trust that you will do the things that you want to do or you ought to do or do do you keep yourself in that direction? Do you keep yourself accountable?</p>
</details>

在核心圈之外，应该是一个由少数人组成的、拥有无条件信任的圈子。这些人是无论发生什么，你都给予他们信任的人。这个圈子应该很小。我认为人们常犯的错误是，他们轻易地与人分享一切，然后当其中一个他们无条件信任的人背叛了他们时，他们就崩溃了。

除了这个小圈子，其他所有人都应该是条件性信任。人们应该通过行动赢得你的信任。你不应该免费赠送它。如果你拥有某人的信任，你也应该尊重它。但我看到太多人轻易地给予信任，因为某个人在某一方面表现出色，他们就产生了光环效应，认为这个人在所有方面都很棒，于是就信任他们。当这种信任被打破时，那种被侵犯的感觉是毁灭性的。一旦失去信任，就真的很难再赢回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Outside of that initial ring, it's it should be a ring of a handful of people that have unconditional trust, right? And these are the people that no matter what, like you've given them that trust. You you believe in them. And it should be a small circle. And this is where I think people go wrong. They're like, "Ah, you know, I I I share everything with people." Then they then they're crushed when one of those people that they've given unconditional trust with break it. That's a problem. Outside of that, you should, everybody else should be conditional trust. People should earn your trust, right? They should be honored to have it. Like, don't give it away for free. And if you have somebody's trust, you should respect that. but I think and I've seen it I people give away trust way too much because the person will be amazing in this one spot and all of a sudden they get the halo effect and they're like well they're great here they must be great here it's this it's this arc of they're awesome everywhere and so I'm going to trust them with these other things then when again they break it they violate it the way you feel is just the this this violation of you know somebody took what you gave them and just destroyed it. It's hard to come back from that. It's hard to once you re once you lose trust like if you lose somebody's trust it's really really hard to get back.</p>

### 领导力与在不确定性中决策
>> 关于领导力原则，你认为最重要的原则是什么？

在混乱中保持冷静的人。那是我对领导者的定义。领导力是一种感觉，斯蒂芬。你如何让这些人感受到我的领导品质？我是否做了那些在你看来是领导力的行为？当我在SWAT团队时，我学到了领导力的真谛，因为我有一些非常出色的指挥官和团队领导。在那种高压下，如果你身边的人能保持镇定，那就是领导力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> On um on leadership principles, something I've heard you talk about as well. Um what what do you think are the most important principles as it relates to leadership? Somebody who's calm under chaos. That would be my definition of a leader. However, and I say that because leadership is a feeling, Stephen, how do you make these people feel as it relates to my qualities as a leader? Do I do the things that register with you as leadership? As I can tell you when I was on a a SWAT team, which is the special weapons and tactics, this is where I learned the true essence of leadership because I had some amazing commanders and and team leaders on that team were under high stress, under a stress like that. If you have people around you that are keeping their composure, that's leadership.</p>

有一项研究，他们观察了三组参加同一场考试的人，试图确定人们在不同程度的确定性和信息下如何做决策。研究显示，一组学生被告知他们通过了考试，另一组被告知他们失败了，还有一组不知道结果。在得知结果前，他们被问及是否愿意去度假。

那些通过和未通过考试的人中，有更高比例的人选择去度假。而不知道结果的第三组，则无法真正做出决定。不确定的模糊性极大地削弱了我们朝某个方向前进的认知能力。所以，当我们不知道该往哪里走时，我们往往寸步难行。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I was reading about a study, which I think you mentioned some time ago, where they look at three groups of people doing the same exam and would were sort of trying to ascertain how people make decisions with different degrees of certainty and information. Yeah. What the the study showed was there were a group of students that you know were taking a test in college and they were told that you know they had either passed or failed or they had no idea whether they passed or failed. But prior to that they were asked if they would you know take a vacation and the people who passed and the people who failed there was a higher percentage of them who chose to take a vacation after getting news that they had either passed college or failed college. the group that didn't know, there was a third group that was just like, I'm un I'm unsure. Weren't able to really make a decision and and so what the what So, the ambiguity of not knowing really lessens our cognitive ability to to go in a certain direction. And so when we don't know where to go, we often don't go anywhere.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> That is a hallmark of great leaders that they're able to decide even when there's very low certainty.</p>
</details>

当然。我认为如果你只在风平浪静时才是一个领导者，那你根本不是领导者，你只是一个薪水更高、头衔更好的人。领导力真正体现在那些不确定的情况下。通常，最好的决定是做正确的决定，而最坏的决定是根本不做决定。

<p class="english-text">>> Sure. I would think that would come with, you know, the territory. I think if you're if you're only a leader when it's calm, then you're not really a leader. You're somebody with a higher salary and a title. Like leadership really shows up in those type of circumstances when when things are uncertain. And so, you know, often times the the best decision to make is the right one and the worst one is to not make a decision at all.</p>

### 建立融洽关系的真正含义
>> 在你对沟通的研究中，有什么让你感到惊讶、颠覆了你原有认知的事情吗？

是的，研究表明，与一个人建立融洽关系（rapport）的能力，是在连接中赋予你最大力量的东西。大多数人认为建立融洽关系就是过分友善、不停恭维、谈论天气。但那不是建立融洽关系的方式。

建立融洽关系是理解一个人的价值观，是理解一个人的存在状态以及他们需要你做什么。如果我关注你，与你互动，让你感到被看见、被听见、被理解，并且通过互惠，你也为我做同样的事，那才是融洽关系。

要建立融洽关系，就要“察言观色”。如果我进来时，看到你表现出某种情绪状态，而我想与你建立连接，我就会问及此事。在我开始我想进行的对话之前，我可能得先进行你想进行的对话。那一刻，可能需要理解你脑子里在想什么。

我可以这样说：“嘿，斯蒂芬，我是Desmond O'Neal。我知道你今天早上因为某些原因被带到这里。现在很明显你看起来非常沮丧。能告诉我发生了什么吗？”如果你告诉我你很害怕，因为你妈妈生病在家没人照顾，那么我现在就有了很多可以与你建立连接的信息。我不会说“那真糟糕”，然后回到我的问题清单。我会说：“我能怎么帮你？”

<p class="english-text">>> Is there anything we haven't talked about today that really surprised you in the research that really caused a paradigm shift in what you thought communication was and now what you think it is? Yeah, the research showed that your ability to build rapport with a person is what gives you the most power in terms of that connection. And how do you build rapport? Most people think that this is one of those things where you're just you're just you're overly kind, you're very complimentary, uh you're talking about the weather, and now we've built rapport and then we're good. It's not how you build rapport. re building rapport is understanding values in terms of a person. Rapport is understanding, you know, a person's presence and what they're needing from you. If I'm paying attention to you and I'm engaged with you and I'm making you feel seen and heard and understood and by proxy, by the reciprocity of doing that, you do the same thing for me. That's rapport. When it comes into building rapport with somebody, read the room. If I came in and I have a list of questions and I see you that you're there's some emotional state that you're showing. If I want to connect with you, I ask about that. I need to put my stuff aside before I can have the conversation I want to have. I probably have to have the conversation you want to have. And at that moment, it may be understanding what is going on in your headsp space. I can say, "Hey, Stephen, you know, I'm Desmond O'Neal. You know, I know you were brought in this morning for for these reasons. It's obvious to me right now that you seem really upset. Can you tell me what's going on right now?" And you could say, you know, I don't know what's going on. I'm super scared. I've never been in jail before. My mom's sick at home and I don't know if there's anybody to take her to her. Now, how much information now do I have, by the way, that I can connect with you? Because if you tell me, I am freaked out. I don't know what's going on. What do I now do? Do I go back to be like, "Well, that sucks." And go back to my list of questions. Or do I say, "How best can I help you with that?"</p>

是的。因为我正在展示同理心，我在倾听你，我在给予你想要的。我正在减少你的不确定性，我正在按照你要求的方向引导你。我向他们展示我正在关注他们，我是真诚的。我会信守承诺，稍后回来告诉他：“嘿，我们查看了你妈妈的情况，她很好。我们让你阿姨去照顾她了。”这就是融洽关系。

<p class="english-text">>> Yes. Because what I'm doing is I'm showing empathy. I'm listening to you. I'm I'm giving you what you want. I'm lessening your ambiguity. I'm orienting you in terms of the direction that you're asking me to take you. I'm showing them that I am paying attention to them. I'm being authentic. I'm going to follow up with the things that I do cuz I'm going to come back later and be like, "Hey, we checked on your mom. She was good. We pulled your aunt in. Your aunt came and took care of her. That's rapport.</p>

### 改善沟通需要停止做的三件事
为了更好地沟通，有三件事你应该立刻停止做。

第一，停止试图证明自己是正确的。

第二，停止告诉别人你“理解”他们。你可以理解一个人的话语，但你永远无法完全理解他们的内心世界。如果你分享一个个人故事，比如你父亲去世了，而我说：“斯蒂芬，我完全理解，我爸爸在我年轻时也去世了。”我就把那个时刻从你身上夺走了，让它变成了关于我的事。我以为我理解你的经历，但事实上，你对死亡的体验与我的完全不同。

第三，停止给别人不请自来的意见。如果她向你表达感受，她可能不是在寻求你告诉她该怎么做，除非她主动问你。我们总是做的第一件事就是：“让我告诉你我的想法。”试图在没有完全了解所有情绪和复杂性的情况下就去“修复”问题。

<p class="english-text">>> No, I just think it was I just think it was a plan framework. And it's not about making things complicated. It's actually about, you know, there's there's things that you should take out, you know, when it comes to communication as opposed to always adding things in. You know, it really becomes like extinction before acquisition. So, I can I can tell you when it comes to better communication, there are three things that you should stop doing right now. One of them is to stop trying to be right. One of them is to stop telling people you understand. And the third one is stop giving people your unsolicited opinion. Now to break those down, stop stop trying to be right. And we talked about that one a little bit. The the second one is stop telling people that you understand. This is what I mean by that. You can understand you can understand a person's words. You will never understand their headsp space in terms of the the specificity of that. And so what you will see is I if if you're sharing a story like if you shared a personal story with me let's say you let's say your father had passed away and I'm like you know what Stephen I completely understand um my dad passed away too when I was young so now we're connected I have just I've just taken away that moment for you because I made it about me because I I thought that I understood something that you had experienced in fact your experience of a death or your experience of your father at the moment is going to be completely different than mine. But for me to tell you that I understand is is shortsighted. The first thing that we always do, and it happens all the time, is like, "Let me tell you what I think. Try to fix it without having all of the the emotions and the complexities of of why it's not being done."</p>

>> 西蒙·斯涅克（Simon Sinek）曾对我说，大多数时候，人们只是想让你和他们一起“坐在泥潭里”。

大多数人确实如此。人们只是在寻找一个共鸣板。如果那是她需要你做的，那么你就给她。就像西蒙·斯涅克说的，只是和他们一起坐在泥潭里，这就是他们对你的要求。如果她转向你问：“斯蒂芬，你会怎么做？”那她就是在征求你的意见。但如果不是，就不要给。

<p class="english-text">Most people do, right? It becomes like this identity headsp space where people just are looking for the sounding board for you, for your girlfriend. Like you're the you're the guy, you're the person, and that's what she comes to you for. That's your job in a lot of ways. And I don't mean that in a a negative thing, but it's just one of those things where if that's what she needs from you, then that's what you give her. And a lot of people just want as as as Simon Senk said where you said it like just sit in the mud with them and that's what they're asking you. If she turns to you and say Stephen what would you do here then she's asking you but if not then don't give it</p>
