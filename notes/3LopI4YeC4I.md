title: 为什么自欺欺人是一种超能力：成功、运气与偏见
---

### 自我中心偏误：我们都觉得自己贡献最大

在新冠疫情封锁期间，一条新闻标题曾迅速走红：
“近一半的男性表示他们承担了大部分的家庭教育工作……而只有百分之三的女性同意这一说法。”
我之所以提及此事，并非要争论谁对谁错，而是因为它很好地说明了一种叫做**自我中心偏误**（Egocentric Bias: 一种认知偏误，指人们倾向于过高估计自己对某事物的贡献或重要性）的现象。
大多数人都认为自己做了大部分的工作。
例如，研究人员曾询问多位合著论文的作者，他们个人完成了多少百分比的工作，结果当他们把这些百分比加起来时，总和平均达到了140%。
当夫妻被问及他们做了多少家务时，两者的总和几乎总是超过100%。
你可能会认为这是因为人们想让自己看起来比实际更有帮助，但事实并非如此。
当夫妻被问及他们引发了多少争吵，或者有多少混乱是他们造成的时，总和再次超过了100%。人们认为自己做了更多的工作，但他们也认为自己造成了更多的问题。那么，这是为什么呢？
我认为这仅仅是因为你清晰地体验并记住了自己所做的一切，但并非所有其他人所做的一切，所以你自然会高估自己的贡献而低估他人的贡献。

<p class="english-text">During the COVID lockdown, this headline went viral:
"Nearly half of men say they do most of the homeschooling...
...three percent of women agree."
I bring this up not to debate who's right, but because it's a great example of something called egocentric bias:
Most people think they do most of the work.
For example, researchers have asked authors of multi-author papers
what percentage of the work they personally did,
and when they add up those percentages, the sum is on average
140 percent.
When couples are asked to estimate how much of the housework they do,
the combined total is almost always over 100%.
Now you might think this is because people want to appear more helpful than they actually are,
but that's not it.
When couples are asked what fraction of the fights they start or how much of the mess is theirs,
the total is again over a hundred. People think they do more of the work,
but they also think they cause more of the problems. So why is this?
I think it's simply because you experience and remember vividly all of what you do,
but not all of what everyone else does,
so naturally you overestimate your own contributions and underestimate others.</p>

### 成功中的运气成分：被低估的因素

我认为这种偏误导致我们低估了其他因素对我们生活的影响，比如运气在我们的成功中所扮演的角色。
以冰球运动员为例。
如果你问一位职业冰球运动员他们是如何进入**NHL**（National Hockey League: 国家冰球联盟，北美顶级职业冰球联赛）的，他们可能会提到自己的努力、决心、优秀的教练、父母凌晨五点起床送他们训练的意愿等等，但他们可能不会承认自己在一月份出生有多么幸运。然而，在许多年份中，被选入顶级联赛的冰球运动员有40%出生在第一季度，而第四季度出生的只有10%；早出生可以让你成为职业冰球运动员的可能性高出四倍。
这种差异的原因大概是因为青少年冰球联赛的年龄截止日期是1月1日。那些在年初出生的孩子年龄稍大一些，因此平均而言比同联赛中年末出生的孩子更大、更快。
随着他们长大，这种差异最终应该会缩小到消失，但事实并非如此。
因为那些最有前途的年轻球员会获得更多的上场时间，参加更多的比赛，在那里他们能得到更好的指导并提高技能。这些优势年复一年地累积，所以当你进入职业联赛时，出生日期会严重偏向年初。
但有哪个职业冰球运动员会感谢他们的生日呢？
可能没有。我们都一样，很大程度上没有意识到那些支持我们成功的幸运事件。
我们许多人所享有的最显著的运气，可能就是出生在一个繁荣的国家；全球各地人们收入差异的大约一半，可以用他们居住的国家及其收入分配来解释。
例如，如果你出生在布隆迪，这个国家的人均**国民总收入**（Gross National Income, GNI: 一个国家一年内所有居民赚取的总收入）每年仅为730美元，是世界上最低的，那么无论你多么聪明或努力工作，你成年后都不太可能赚到很多钱。
如果你指出运气在他们的成功中扮演了多大的角色，许多人会感到被冒犯，我理解这种感受。如果我们仅仅是环境的产物，那么我们的努力和才能似乎就毫无意义。
人们认为成功只能用技能或运气来解释，但事实是你两者都需要。
以这八项田径世界纪录为例：所有取得这些纪录的运动员显然都是世界级的，极其敬业且才华横溢，然而，当他们创造世界纪录时，八人中有七人是顺风。
这些运动员都有能力赢得金牌，但要创造世界纪录还需要一点运气。
申请者越多，竞争越激烈，运气的重要性就越大。
以最近一届NASA宇航员为例。
在2017年的18,300多名申请者中，只有11人被选中并最终从宇航员培训计划中毕业。
现在我们可以建立一个关于选拔过程的玩具模型。
假设宇航员的选拔主要基于技能、经验和努力工作，但也假设有5%是由于运气——即幸运的环境。
对于每个申请者，我随机生成一个满分100的技能分数，并随机生成一个满分100的运气分数。
然后我将这些数字加起来，以95比5的比例加权，得到一个总分。
这个分数代表了选拔者的判断，意味着按此标准排名前11的人将成为宇航员。
我将这个模拟重复了一千次，代表了一千次不同的宇航员选拔。
我发现被选中的宇航员都非常幸运；他们的平均运气分数为94.7。
那么，仅凭技能，有多少被选中的宇航员会进入前11名呢？
答案是，平均只有1.6人。
这意味着，即使运气只占结果的5%，如果运气完全不起作用，被选中的11名申请者中，有9名甚至10名都会是不同的人。
当竞争激烈时，有才华和努力工作固然重要，但这不足以保证成功。
你还需要抓住机会。
在很大程度上，我认为我们没有意识到自己的好运，因为根据定义，那不是我们自己做的事情。
就像你另一半做的家务一样，它没有得到应有的赞赏。

<p class="english-text">And I think this bias leads us to underestimate the influence of other things on our lives
like the role luck plays in our success.
Take hockey players, for example.
If you ask a professional hockey player how they managed to reach the NHL,
they might mention their hard work, determination, great coaches, their parents willingness to get up at 5 AM, and so on,
but they probably won't acknowledge how lucky they were to be born in January. And yet, in many years 40%
of hockey players selected into top tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10%
in the fourth quarter; an early birthday can make you up to four times as likely to be a pro hockey player.
And the reason for this disparity is presumably because the cutoff date for kids hockey leagues is January 1st.
Those born in the first part of the year are a little older and so on average bigger and faster than kids in their league born late in the year.
Now as they grow up, this difference should eventually shrink to nothing, but it doesn't.
Because the young kids who share the most promise are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments, where they receive better coaching
and improve their skills. And these advantages compound year after year,
so by the time you get to the pros, birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year.
But does any professional hockey player feel thankful for their birthday?
Probably not. And we are all like that, largely oblivious to the fortunate events that support our success.
Probably the most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy is being born into a prosperous country;
around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence
and that country's income distribution.
If you were born in Burundi, for example, which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita of just 730 dollars a year,
it doesn't matter how smart or hard-working you are; you're unlikely to earn much as an adult.
Now many people get offended if you point out how big a role chance plays in their success
and I get it. If we are just a product of our circumstances,
then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing.
People think it has to be either skill or luck that explains success, but the truth is you need both.
Take these eight track and field world records: all the athletes who achieve these records are obviously
world class, extremely dedicated, and talented and yet, when they achieved their world records, seven out of eight had a tailwind.
Now these athletes all had the ability to win a gold medal, but to set the world record required a bit of luck as well.
The importance of luck increases the greater the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces.
Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts.
From over 18,300 applicants in 2017,
only 11 were selected and went on to graduate from the astronaut training program.
Now we can make a toy model of the selection process.
Let's assume that astronauts are selected mostly based on skill,
experience, and hard work, but also say five percent as a result of luck — fortunate circumstances.
For each applicant, I randomly generated a skill score out of a hundred,
and I also randomly generated a luck score out of a hundred.
Then I added those numbers together, weighted in the 95-to-5 ratio to get an overall score.
This score represents the selector's judgments, meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts.
And I repeated this simulation a thousand times representing a thousand different astronaut selections.
And what I found was the astronauts who were picked were very lucky; they had an average luck score of 94.7.
So how many of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone?
The answer was, on average, only 1.6.
That means, even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected
would have been different if luck played no role at all.
When competition is fierce, being talented and hard-working is important, but it's not enough to guarantee success.
You also need to catch a break.
Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck because, by definition, it's not something we did.
Like the housework done by your significant other, it goes unappreciated.</p>

### “有用错觉”：相信掌控命运的力量

而这正是最疯狂的事情：
轻视偶然事件的重要性实际上可能会提高你成功的概率，因为如果你认为某个结果是不确定的，你就不太可能为此投入努力，这会进一步降低你成功的机会。
所以，相信你完全掌控自己的命运是一种有用的错觉。
我的意思是，如果我当初开始做YouTube时知道自己有多糟糕，或者需要付出多少努力，我可能早就放弃了。

<p class="english-text">And here's the crazy thing:
Downplaying the importance of chance events may actually improve your probability of success because
if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain, you're less likely to invest effort in it, which further decreases your chances of success.
So, it's a useful delusion to believe you are in full control of your destiny.
I mean, if I had known how bad I was when I started YouTube or how much work it would take, I might have given up right then.

### 忽视运气的负面影响：自以为是与社会不公

现在，忽视你的幸运机会可能还有另一个好处，那就是它让你更容易为自己在社会中的地位辩护：
如果你拥有大量的财富或权力，你可以将其归因于自己的智慧、努力和毅力。
这使得接受不平等变得更容易。
在一个实验中，参与者被分成三人一组，在小房间里讨论一个复杂的道德问题，每组中有一人被随机指定为团队领导。
半小时后，实验者带着四块饼干来到每组。
那么谁得到了多出来的那块饼干呢？在每种情况下，都是团队领导。尽管他们没有特殊的才能，没有额外的责任，而且他们的职位完全是偶然获得的。
一旦你获得了某种地位，似乎很自然地会觉得你理所当然地拥有它以及随之而来的所有其他好事。
这只是一个轶事，但每当我被升级到商务舱飞行时，我总是观察到我的那些享有特权的乘客表现出最糟糕的行为；他们只是表现得非常自以为是和无礼。研究也发现了这方面的证据。
在另一个实验中，参与者被要求回忆最近发生在他们身上的一件好事，然后一组被要求列出他们自己的个人品质或行为，是这些品质或行为促成了那件好事；另一组被要求列出超出他们控制的外部因素，是这些因素导致了那件事发生；对照组则被简单地要求列出好事发生的原因。
完成这项任务后，参与者被告知他们将获得一美元报酬，但在最后，他们被提供了将部分或全部钱捐给慈善机构的选择。
结果显示，那些列出自己个人特质的人比那些列出超出他们控制的外部因素的人少捐了25%。
现在想想这一切对我们社会中的人意味着什么，特别是对那些身居高位的人，比如商业领袖和政治家。
毫无疑问，他们中的大多数人都有才华且努力工作，但他们也比大多数人更幸运，而且和我们大多数人一样，他们没有意识到自己有多么幸运。
这让他们对现实产生了扭曲的看法。
他们有点像生活在一种**幸存者偏误**（Survivor Bias: 一种逻辑谬误，指人们只关注那些“幸存”下来的人或事物，从而忽略了那些未能幸存的，导致对整体情况的错误判断）中：所有这些领导者都努力工作并最终取得了成功，所以对他们来说，世界是公平的。
在他们的经验中，世界会奖励努力工作，但他们没有经历过所有那些努力工作却失败的人的经验。
那么，他们会如何看待那些不如自己成功的人呢？
自然的结论是，那些人一定只是天赋不足或不够努力，而这种观点使他们不那么倾向于慷慨——去回馈社会。
而他们正是制定社会运作规则的人。
这尤其不幸，因为我们许多人之所以幸运，主要原因之一就是我们居住的国家。
但一个国家除了前人所建造的一切，又是什么呢？
道路和学校、公共交通、紧急服务、清洁的空气和水，所有这些。
我们的心理学似乎玩了一个残酷的把戏，让成功人士在没有任何恶意的情况下，将自己的成功主要归功于自己的努力和聪明才智，因此对维持最初使成功成为可能的环境贡献更少。

<p class="english-text">Now there may be another benefit to overlooking your lucky breaks,
which is it makes it easier to justify your place in society:
if you have a lot of wealth or power, you can just chalk it up to your own intelligence, effort, and perseverance.
It makes it easier to accept inequality.
In one experiment, participants were put in groups of three in small rooms to discuss a complex moral problem,
and one person in each group was randomly designated the team leader.
Half an hour later, the experimenter came by with four cookies for each team.
So who got the extra cookie? In each case, it went to the team leader. Even though they had no special aptitude,
they didn't have extra responsibilities and they'd gotten their position through chance alone.
Once you have achieved a certain status,
it seems natural to feel like you deserve it and all the other good things that come your way.
Now this is just an anecdote,
but whenever I've been upgraded to fly a business class, I've always observed the worst behavior in my fellow privileged passengers;
they just act so entitled and uncourteous. And research has found evidence for this as well.
In another experiment, participants were asked to think of a good thing that happened to them recently,
and then one group was asked to list their own personal qualities or actions that made that good thing happen,
another group was asked to list external factors beyond their control that led to the event,
and a control group was simply asked to list reasons why the good thing happened.
Now for completing this task, participants were told they would be paid a dollar,
but at the end they were offered the option to donate some or all of the money to a charity.
Results showed those who listed their own personal attributes contributed 25% less
than those who listed external factors beyond their control.
Now think of what all this means for people in our society,
specifically for people in positions of power like business leaders and politicians.
Now undoubtedly most of them are talented and hard-working,
but they have also been luckier than most, and like most of us, they don't realize just how lucky they are.
And this gives them a distorted view of reality.
They're kind of living in a form of survivor bias: all these leaders have worked hard and ultimately succeeded,
so to them the world appears fair.
In their experience, it rewards hard work,
but what they don't have is the experience of all the people who have worked hard and failed.
So what are they to make of people less successful than themselves?
Well, the natural conclusion is that they must just be less talented or less hard-working,
and this perspective makes them less inclined to be generous — to give back.
And they are the ones who set the rules for how society operates.
And this is particularly unfortunate since one of the main ways many of us are lucky is in our country of residence.
But what is a country except for the things put there by people who came before?
The roads and the schools, public transport, emergency services, clean air and water, everything like that.
It seems a cruel trick of our psychology that successful people without any malice will credit their success largely to their own hard work and ingenuity,
and therefore contribute less to maintaining the very
circumstances that made that success possible in the first place.</p>

### 承认运气的益处：更受欢迎与感恩

好消息是，承认我们的幸运境遇不仅能让我们更符合现实，还能让我们更受欢迎。
在一项研究中，人们需要阅读一份虚构的《60分钟》节目对一位生物科技企业家的采访稿，实验者只改变了最后一段，其中受访者谈论了公司成功的原因。
在一个版本中，这位企业家将自己的成功完全归功于个人；而在另一个版本中，他表示运气扮演了重要角色。
结果，阅读了“运气版本”采访稿的人认为这位企业家更善良，并且认为他们更有可能与他成为亲密朋友，而不是阅读另一个版本采访稿的人。
提高我们对幸运事件的认识也能让我们更快乐，因为它能让我们心怀感恩。
就我个人而言，我很感谢Vsauce的迈克尔·史蒂文斯（Michael Stevens），他于2012年10月7日发布了视频《影子有多重？》（"How Much Does a Shadow Weigh?"），其中提到了我的慢动作弹簧下落视频，三天之内我的订阅者增加了三分之一，一个月之内翻了一番，这促使我辞去了兼职工作，全身心投入到YouTube视频创作中。
我也很感谢悉尼火车上免费报纸的作者，他们对电力的理解不太准确，这让我把他们的文章图片发布到我的Instagram上，并配文：“这张图片有什么问题？”
我很幸运，第一个正确回答的人是一位美丽的女士，她成为了我未来的妻子。
是的！
我就是这样遇见你妈妈的。

<p class="english-text">The good news is that acknowledging our fortunate circumstances not only brings us more in line with reality,
it also makes us more likeable.
In a study where people had to read the transcript of a fictional 60-minutes interview with a biotech entrepreneur,
experimenters tried changing just the last paragraph where the interviewee is talking about the reasons for their company's success.
In one version, the entrepreneur personally takes credit for the success they've had,
but in the other, he says luck played a significant role.
Now people who read the luck version of the transcript judged the entrepreneur as kinder,
and thought they'd be more likely to be close friends with him than those who read the other version of the transcript.
And raising our awareness of fortunate events can also make us happier because it allows us to feel gratitude.
Personally, I am grateful to Michael Stevens of Vsauce,
who on October 7th, 2012, posted the video: "How Much Does a Shadow Weigh?",
which shouts out my slow-motion slinky drop video,
and within three days my subscribers had increased by a third, and within a month,
they had doubled, leading me to quit my part-time job and work exclusively on YouTube videos.
And I'm grateful to the writer of the free newspaper
they give out on the trains in Sydney who didn't quite understand electricity,
leading me to post this picture of their article to my Instagram with the caption: "What's wrong with this picture?"
And I'm lucky that the first person to answer correctly was a beautiful woman who became my future wife.
Yep!
That is how I met your mother.</p>

### 成功的悖论：相信努力，承认运气

最初，我制作这个视频只是想说，我们的环境和心理共同作用，使我们对自己的运气视而不见。
这导致成功人士认为世界是公平的，而那些不如他们成功的人则被认为是天赋不足或不够努力。
这甚至还没有考虑到任何歧视或偏见。
但是，我也逐渐意识到我应该谈谈如果你想在这样的世界中取得成功该怎么做，我认为最好的建议是矛盾的。
首先，你必须相信你完全掌控自己的命运，并且你的成功只取决于你自己的才能和努力。
但其次，你必须知道这对你或任何人都不是真的。
所以你必须记住：如果你确实取得了成功，那么运气扮演了重要角色，鉴于你的好运，你应该尽力增加他人的运气。
嘿，我有一个想法，我可以做些什么来增加他人的运气，那就是向那些负担不起的人赠送一百套**snatoms**（一种分子模型套件，通过磁力将原子连接起来，旨在纠正“化学键储存能量”的误解）套件。
如果你不知道，snatoms是我五年前发明并启动的一个产品。
它是一种分子模型套件，所有的原子都可以通过磁力连接在一起。
我之所以制作它，是因为我真的想解决“化学键储存能量”这个误解。
它们不储存能量。打破它们需要能量，你可以用snatoms感受到这一点。
最近，我彻底改造了snatoms。现在磁铁所在的地方有小孔，这使得它们可以直接接触，增加了键合强度，这样你就可以形成更大更稳定的分子。我称之为“snatomsX”。
是的，它们与最初的snatoms向后兼容。所以，这是我的想法：
在接下来的一个月里，你可以使用代码“giveluck”以九折优惠购买snatoms，每售出一套，我将向一个负担不起的人赠送一套，上限为一百套。
所以，我会在描述中放置链接和更多细节，我真的非常感谢你的观看，也感谢我所有的好运。

<p class="english-text">Now initially, I wanted to make this video just to say our circumstances and psychology conspire to make us oblivious to our own luck.
This leads successful people to view the world as fair,
and those less successful than them as less talented or less hard-working.
And this is before you factor in any discrimination or prejudice.
But, it also became apparent to me that I should talk about what to do if you want to be successful in such a world,
and I think the best advice is paradoxical.
First, you must believe that you are in complete control of your destiny,
and that your success comes down only to your own talent and hard work.
But second, you've got to know that's not true for you or anyone else.
So you have to remember: if you do achieve success that luck played a significant role and given your good fortune,
you should do what you can to increase the luck of others.
Hey, so I had an idea for what I could do to increase the luck of others and that is to give away a hundred
snatoms kits to people who couldn't otherwise afford them.
So, if you didn't know snatoms is a product that I invented and kick-started five years ago.
It's a molecular modeling kit where all the atoms snap together magnetically.
Now, I made it because I really wanted to tackle the misconception that bonds store energy.
They don't. It takes energy to break them, and you can feel that with snatoms.
Recently, I completely retooled snatums. So there are small holes where the magnets are
This allows them to touch directly, increasing the bonding strength, so you can form bigger more stable molecules. I call these "snatomsX".
And yes, they are backwards compatible with original snatoms. So, here's my idea:
for the next month you can buy snatoms for 10% off using the code "giveluck"
and for each one sold, I will give a kit to someone who can't afford one, up to a limit of a hundred.
So, I'll put links and more details in the description, and I really want to thank you
for watching, and thank you for all my good luck.</p>
