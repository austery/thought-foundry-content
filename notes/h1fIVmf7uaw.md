title: 长期贪婪，短期不傻：Panera 创始人揭示 78 亿美元出售背后的商业哲学
---

### 长期贪婪，而非短期愚蠢

我从事这个行业已经超过半个世纪了。我曾参与在美国创建面包咖啡馆，比如 Au Bon Pain 和 Panera，这些都是市场上的主导品牌。你是如何培养出这种应用于所有这些不同概念的长期思维的？我有一个说法：我选择“长期贪婪，而非短期愚蠢”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've done this now over half a century. I was part of building bakery cafes in America between Au Bon Pain and Panera. These were the dominant brands. How do you develop the long-term thinking that you've brought to all these different concepts? I have an expression. I'm long-term greedy, not short-term stupid.</p>
</details>

这听起来似乎显而易见，但你当时是如何获得这一洞见的？我认为，作为一名商人，我最强大的技能，也是我希望企业家们去掌握的技能，就是……谈谈经营企业的困难吧，比如家庭成本、社会成本。当你做任何需要强大投入的事情时，那份投入会占据你，而不是你拥有它。这其中有非常真实的个人代价。我结过两次婚，这并非我引以为傲的事。我所有关于商业的信念都始于三个词。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, it seems so obvious, but how did you hit on this insight at the time? I think that the most powerful skill that I have as a business person and what I would challenge entrepreneurs to acquire is the skill of... talk to me about the difficulties of running a business. The family cost, the social cost when you're doing anything that's takes powerful commitment. That commitment owns you. You don't own it. There's a very real personal price. I've been married twice. It's not something I'm proud of. Everything I believe in about business starts with three words.</p>
</details>

### 以终为始：从个人健康到人生规划

你最近在痴迷什么？实际上，是我的健康。对你来说，痴迷于健康意味着什么？嗯，我 71 岁了，我看着我的孩子们，看着我的人际关系，生命中有太多值得活下去的理由，有太多想看的事物。我真的想尽我所能，给自己一切机会去生活，去见证这个世界如何展开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are you obsessed with lately? My health, actually. What does that mean for you to be obsessed with that? Well, I'm 71 and I look at my kids. I look at my relationships and there's so much to live for and so much to see and I really want to do everything I can to give myself every opportunity to live and see how the world unfolds.</p>
</details>

那又是如何改变了你的行为呢？我对此变得更加认真了。因为在我年轻的时候，三四十岁、五十多岁时，我可能更专注于工作、人际关系和家庭。随着我对这件事有了更深的认识，我意识到如果我真要做点什么，现在就是时候了。所以我努力每天都进行某种形式的认真锻炼，并且注意健康饮食，服用正确的药物和补充剂，尽一切可能帮助自己。但对我来说，这关乎一种生活态度。这种态度本质上始于一种观点，那就是我们有责任去弄清楚未来我们将会尊重什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how has that changed your behaviors? I got more serious about it because I would say in my earlier years, 30s, 40s, and 50s, I was probably more focused on work and relationships, family, and as I gained perspective on it, if I'm ever going to do it, now's the time. So, I'm trying to literally work out every day in some serious way and really eat well, take the right medication, supplements, anything I can to help myself. Uh, but to me, that's about an attitude towards life. And that attitude essentially starts with a view that it's our responsibility to figure out what it is that we're going to respect in the future.</p>
</details>

我通过一个故事来说明。大约 30 年前，我目睹了父母的离世。其中一位走得非常安详，另一位则不那么平静，他们似乎在反思自己一生中做的一些决定。我开始意识到，人是有一个“审判日”的。我不能告诉你，Shane，它是否在天上，那是个人的精神抉择。但我可以告诉你，如果你患有慢性病，并且有机会，你在生命终结时会经历一个审判日，一个自我审判。30 年前看着他们离去，我为自己下了一个结论：我希望有机会拥有那个审判日，但不是在第九局两人出局时，而是在第七局、第五局、第三局，在我还能真正做些什么的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I tell it by way of a story. I watched my mom and dad pass away now 30 odd years ago. One of them died very much at peace, the other not so much at peace. And they really were second-guessing some of the decisions they've made in their lives. And I began to realize there's a judgment day. I can't tell you, Shane, it's up there. That's a personal spiritual decision. But I can tell you if you have a chronic illness and you have the opportunity, you have a judgment day, a self judgment as you go through the end of life. And watching them die 30 years ago, I concluded for me, I wanted that opportunity to have that judgment day, not in the ninth inning with two outs, but in the seventh inning, the fifth inning, the third inning when I could really do something about it.</p>
</details>

从那时起，我开始每年坐下来问自己：在五年和十年后，在我的工作关系、家庭朋友关系、身体关系以及我与自己精神世界的关系中，我将会尊重什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And ever since I began on an annual basis sitting down and saying what is it in five years and 10 years I'm going to respect in the context of my relationships with my work my relationships with my family and friends my relationships with my body and my own relationships with my my own spirituality.</p>
</details>

所以，定义我将尊重什么，这个过程就是我的起点。然后，我会将那些我想达成的目标和举措进行系统化编码，把它们编成一个个项目。接着，我每个季度都会和自己坐下来谈谈，问：“我做得怎么样？我是在自欺欺人，还是真的在完成我承诺要做的事情？”随着时间的推移，我越来越意识到我必须更好地照顾自己的身体。锻炼的力量、身体参与的力量真的很重要。我想，今天我对这种关系的感受比我生命中任何其他时刻都要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that process of defining what I'll respect is where I began. And I would then on a basically codify those initiatives, those things I was trying to accomplish. I'd codify them into projects and then literally sit down with myself once a quarter and say, "How am I doing? Am I actually full of baloney or or not? Am I actually getting done what I signed up to do?" And so increasingly over time, bring it back, I have found myself realizing that I have to do a better job of caring for my body. And that the power of exercise, the power of physical engagement really matters. And I think I feel better about that relationship today than probably at any other point in my life.</p>
</details>

### 季度复盘：将人生目标项目化

带我看看你的一次季度复盘吧。那对你来说是怎样的？你会打开日历，看看你是如何分配时间的吗？是的，我们会看时间，但重点不全在于时间。时间是一种手段，而不是目的。我真正关注的是我完成了什么？我是否完成了那些我说过需要做的事情，以创造出我希望在三、五、十年后达到的状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take me through one of those quarterly reviews. What does that look like to you? Do you like pull up your calendar and look at how you're spending your time? Yes, we look at time, but it's not so much about time. Time is a is a means. It's not the the end. I'm really looking at what did I get done? Did I get done the things that I said I needed to do to create that condition that I'm trying to attain in three, five, and 10 years.</p>
</details>

我给你举一个非常具体的例子，还是在健康领域。大概是 15 年前，我去看医生，发现自己处于糖尿病前期。当时我也在 Panera 工作，有一位医疗顾问帮助我处理食物对顾客的影响，我们希望能真正服务好大家。我们当时做了一个清洁食品倡议，他让我戴上一个连续血糖监测仪，想看看 Panera 的食物对我的影响。我的医生和我在 Panera 的工作经历让我意识到，我需要管理好自己与碳水化合物的关系，管理好自己的饮食。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I give you a very specific example, and we're staying in the health domain. I think it was probably 15 years ago. I went to my doctor and I realized I was on the edge of becoming pre-diabetic. I was also doing work at Panera and I had a medical adviser helping me deal with how our food manifested itself and we wanted to really serve people. We had done a clean food initiative and he put me on a continuous glucose monitor and he wanted me to see how I was effective at Panera food and and that whole experience between my doctor and this work I was doing at Panera made me realize I needed to manage my own relationship with carbohydrates, my own relationship with my diet.</p>
</details>

这让我对自己说，嘿，如果你想做这件事，就得行动起来。那时我大概 50 多岁，我说，如果我真要这么做，就必须开始努力了。然后我把这个目标分解成项目。其中之一，对我来说，是转向更偏向素食的饮食。另一项是聘请一位教练。我雇了一位乌克兰前奥运田径教练，他在 12 年里，每天早上 5:30 来我家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that led me to say, hey, if you're ever going to do this, I was at that time, you know, mid-50s. I said, if I'm ever going to do that, I got to get to work on doing it. And I then put that into projects. One of which was in my case to to move to a more vegan diet. Another piece of that was to hire a trainer. and I hired a Ukrainian former Olympic trainer, track and field coach who would come to my house at 5:30 in the morning and did so for for 12 years.</p>
</details>

我想说的是，我试图创造一种状态，尽管没人知道我们最终会走向何方。然后问题是，为了达到这个状态，我能做哪些项目？接着每个季度坐下来评估一下，我做得怎么样？现在 15 年过去了，我仍然戴着那个连续血糖监测仪，我的血糖处于正常偏低的水平。这是一种我用来保持数据和持续学习的方式，它是一个持续进行的项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what I'm really saying is I'm trying to create a state and then the question is what are the the projects the things I can do to do that? And then to sit down and say every quarter, how am I doing against that? So now we're 15 years later. I still wear that continuous glucose monitor. My blood sugar is you know low normal. Um but it's a way in which I keep the data and I've become educated. It's an ongoing project.</p>
</details>

现在锻炼也是一样。我换了一个教练，自己也在不断进步。现在我努力提升我的**最大摄氧量**（VO2 Max: 衡量有氧适能的关键指标，指在极限运动中身体能摄入和利用氧气的最大速率），而不仅仅是力量。我正在尝试各种不同的方法。但同样，所有这些都是为了实现一个最终目标的项目——认识到照顾好自己是我的责任。没人知道这一切会如何发展，也不知道我或我们中的任何一个人是否能保持健康。但我能做的，就是尽力而为。我会定期坐下来，把这些都写下来。我明确地说：“这是我想要达到的目标。”然后我真的会把它写下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um same thing now with exercise. I have a different trainer. Um, I've evolved, but I'm really trying hard now to push up my V2 max as opposed to simply my my my strength and I'm playing with a bunch of different things. But but again, all of these are project against an end of trying to to recognize it's my responsibility to care for myself and nobody knows how this is all going to play out and whether I will remain healthy or not or any of us will. But I can do what I can do. And on a regular basis, I'm sitting there and I'm I'm literally writing it down. I'm really saying, "This is where I'm trying to get to." And then I am literally writing it down.</p>
</details>

当我跟别人说我每天都锻炼时，这很有争议。人们会说：“你疯了，你需要休息。”而我会说：“对我来说，每天锻炼比一周锻炼五天更容易。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's controversial when I talk to people about exercising every day. People are like, "You're crazy. You need rest." And I'm like, "It's easier to exercise every day than it is five days a week for me anyway."</p>
</details>

是的，我致力于每天都这样做。事实上，作为项目的一部分，我每天早上 8 点都安排了锻炼。我要么和教练一起，要么自己练，但我早上 8 点一定会在那里，在一天开始前把它完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I'm committed to it every day. And in fact, what I did, again, part of that project is I I set an appointment for 8 am every day. And I either do it with a trainer or myself, but I'm there 8:00 a.m. and I get it done before the day begins, basically.</p>
</details>

而且，你知道，我已经开始对自己更友善一些了。我不再早上 5:30 锻炼了，但我仍然希望在一天开始前完成它。因为如果这件事真的很重要，是我努力推动的关键事项之一，是我专注的项目之一，那么我就必须确保为它留出时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and you know, I've started to be a little more um kind to myself. I'm not doing at 5:30 a.m. anymore, but I still I want to get it done before the day starts because if it's really important, it's one of the key things I'm trying to drive and it's one of the projects I'm focused on, then I have to make sure I make time.</p>
</details>

### 商业是改变世界最有力的杠杆

用你现在的智慧回顾过去，在创建 Au Bon Pain 和 Panera 的时候，你是否希望自己当初能更重视健康？是的，但我也必须把它放在当时的情境中来看。你看，我 71 岁了，我感到无比幸运。我拥有精彩的人生，身体一直很健康，现在仍处于人生的黄金时期。我拥有非凡的家庭，有机会从事非常有趣的工作，影响了成千上万甚至数以百万计的人。我能够运用我的思想，有机会过上这样蒙福的生活。回首过去，我当然学到了很多教训，有些事情我可能会做得不一样，但总的来说，我感到无比平静和满足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With the wisdom that you have now, looking back and and building Au Bon Pain, Panera, which I want to get into in detail, do you wish you would have placed more of an emphasis on your health back then? Yes, but I have to put that in context as well. Look at I'm 71. I couldn't feel more blessed. I've had uh an amazing life. I've had great health. I'm still in the prime of my life. Uh I have extraordinary family. I've had um the chance to do really interesting work and impact hundreds of thousands, if not millions of of people. I've been able to engage my mind. I've had this opportunity to live a blessed life. I look backwards and there are certainly lessons I've learned and things I might do differently, but taken as a whole, I couldn't be more at peace and more pleased.</p>
</details>

这种对健康的关注是否改变了你对食物以及为餐厅顾客创造体验的看法？比如，我想到像 True Food Kitchen 这样非常注重健康的餐厅。这如何改变你为数百万美国人提供日常餐饮的思路？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does it change how you think about sort of food and the experience that you're creating for people in the restaurant? Like I think of something like True Food Kitchen, which is a very health-conscious sort of restaurant. How how does it change how you think about serving millions of Americans every day?</p>
</details>

我一直都希望能在人们的生活中有所作为。我最初接触世界的方式是在政治领域，但通过大学里的一些经历，我发现商业可能是你能做的最具创造性的事情之一。对于一个不会跳舞、不会唱歌的孩子来说，我被商业的力量深深震撼了——它既有创造性，又是变革的杠杆。我认为，作为一名商人，我参与的积极改变比我从政、进入政府或当律师所能做的要多得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've always come from a place of wanting to make a difference in people's lives. My way of approaching the world was essentially initially in a political context and I discovered through some experiences in university and we can talk about these but but I discovered that business is probably one of the most creative things you can ever do and for a a kid who couldn't dance and couldn't sing I was I was blown away by the power of business both the creativity of it and it is a lever to change. I think I've been involved in more change as a business person, more positive change for the world than I ever could have been if I had done politics or gone into government or been a lawyer.</p>
</details>

以 Panera 为例。Panera 是美国首批引入无抗生素鸡肉的两个品牌之一。它引领了市场的变革，作为一个挑战者品牌，我们通过这样做实际上打开了市场，降低了价格，然后像麦当劳、Chick-fil-A 这样的公司都跟进了。我们也是最早从菜单中去除反式脂肪的公司之一。在 2010 年、2012 年初，美国政府希望公布食物的卡路里信息，整个行业都在激烈地反对。我们公开表示，如果一个行业的人害怕公布食物中的卡路里信息，那这个行业有什么问题？也许答案不是试图隐藏它，而是如果你认为人们不会对此感到满意，就去改变你食物中的成分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you take Panera. Panera was one of the two first brands to introduce antibiotic free chicken in America. It led to changing the marketplaces, the Challenger brand, and doing so, we actually opened up the market, lowered the prices, and in came, you know, everybody from McDonald's to Chick-fil-A. We were the among the first people to remove trans fats from our menu. In the early 2010, 2012, the US government wanted to post caloric information. The industry was fighting it intensely publicly said look at you know what what's the problem with this industry if people are afraid of of posting caloric information what's in their food maybe the answer isn't trying to hide it maybe the answer is to actually change what you got in your food if you think people aren't going to be too pleased with that.</p>
</details>

我们走在了前列，有机会成为首批去除所有人造色素、香料、甜味剂和防腐剂的大型组织之一，真正推动了现在所谓的“清洁食品”运动，去除了超加工成分。我知道我们带来了改变。我也认为我们在饮食文化上带来了改变。我长大的时候，人们的选择只有快餐和高级餐厅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we were in the lead and and had the opportunity to be one of the first large organizations to remove all artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, really to to push for what is now called clean food. Uh removing the ultra processing and I I I know that we've made a difference. Um I also think we made a difference in in in in the food culture. When I grew up, the only choices were fast food and fine dining.</p>
</details>

### 同理心的力量与“快餐休闲”的诞生

在 90 年代初，正如你和一些听众可能知道的，我们真正发展出了一种理念，后来被称为**快餐休闲**（Fast Casual: 一种介于快餐和正餐之间的餐饮模式，提供比快餐更高品质的食物和环境，但服务速度比正餐快）。这并不复杂。我们开始四处观察，在 92、93 年时发现，有三分之一到四分之一的消费者在走进快餐店时是捏着鼻子的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the early 90s, as I think you and maybe some of your listeners know, we really developed the ideology that became what is called today fast casual. Wasn't very complicated. We we we began to to look around and could see this been 92 93 that one out of of three consumers, one out of four consumers held their noses when they went into fast food.</p>
</details>

于是你问自己：“他们到底在寻找什么？”我知道我们花了一两年的时间在路上倾听人们的声音。你听到的是，很多消费者真正寻求的是真实的食物、能让他们投入的环境、由关心他们的员工提供服务，他们实际上想要一种能提升自我感觉的体验，而不是像在快餐店那样感到被消耗。我们开始思考，如果我们能创造出那样的环境，我们就能创造出能提升人们感受的东西，这是一个巨大的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you said, "What is it that they're looking for?" And I know we spent a year or two on the road listening to people. And what you heard was that so many of these consumers, what they really sought was real food, environments that engaged them, served by people that that cared, and they actually wanted an experience that elevated their sense of self, not depleted it, which is what they experienced in fast food. And we began to say if we could create that kind of environment that we we could create something that that actually elevated people and that this was a powerful opportunity.</p>
</details>

当时我是在为自己的公司寻找出路，但这种理念，这种世界观——在 90 年代初没人认为会成功——最终成为了推动今天所谓的“快餐休闲”产业的理念，这是一个价值 3500 亿美元的产业。Panera 成为了它的典范。星巴克的霍华德·舒尔茨（Howard Schultz）和 Chipotle 的史蒂夫·埃尔斯（Steve Ells）也采用了类似的模式。我认为，我们共同见证了饮食文化的演变。我非常高兴。我们所做的一件事就是表明，食物远不止是填饱肚子和追求便宜。餐饮业是第二古老的行业，其核心是热情好客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I was trying to figure it out for my own company but that ideology that view of the world which in the early 90s nobody thought would ever work that became the ideology that fueled what's called fast casual today which is a $350 billion business. Um, Panera became the poster child for it. Uh, Howard Schultz, Starbucks played a similar kind of um, paradigm. Steve Ell's and Chipotle. And I think together you saw the the evolution of food culture. I'm I'm so pleased. One of the things that we did was just say food was about so much more than what you put in your stomach and how cheap it was. Food industry is the second oldest profession and it's about hospitality at its core.</p>
</details>

我们创造了人们真正愿意坐下来的环境，邀请他们进来享受，并发现这是一个可以进行面试、召集足球妈妈、举办圣经学习小组、或撰写伟大的美国小说的地方。所有这些体验都在我们创造的环境中上演。对我来说，这是对人们生活的美好贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the idea that we could create environments that people actually wanted to sit in and invite them to to come in and enjoy it and to find it as a place where you where you really did want to have an interview, gather the soccer moms, have a Bible study group, write the great American novel. I mean, all of these were experiences that played out in environments that we created. And to me, that was a a beautiful contribution to people's lives.</p>
</details>

现在回想起来，这似乎显而易见，但你当时是如何获得这一洞见的？我认为，作为一名商人，我最强大的技能，也是我希望企业家们去掌握的技能，就是同理心。同理心是能够进入他人大脑，感受他们的感受，看到他们所见的能力，不是为了向他们推销，而是为了理解和欣赏他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's remarkable. I mean, looking back now, it seems so obvious, but how did you hit on this insight at the time? I think that the most powerful skill that I have as a business person and what I would challenge entrepreneurs to acquire is the skill of empathy. Empathy is about the ability to climb into somebody else's brain to feel what they're feeling and to see what they're feeling and not sell them but understand and appreciate them.</p>
</details>

我认为，从历史上看，我们一直拥有这类技能。你知道，当你谈论我的职业生涯时，你常常会提到财务结果。比如 Cava，它可以说是过去五年中最成功的餐饮服务**首次公开募股**（Initial Public Offering: 指一家企业首次将其股份向公众出售）案例。现在是一家价值 70 亿美元的公司，最高时曾达到 150 亿美元，但比一年半前 IPO 时增长了三四倍。你谈论 Panera，它是过去二十年里表现最好的餐厅股票，其最后二十年的**内部收益率**（Internal Rate of Return: 一种投资的评估方法，是净现值为零时的折现率）达到了 25%。事实上，有人告诉我，我们甚至击败了沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）和伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司（Berkshire Hathaway）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that historically we've had those kinds of skills. I mean, you know, when you talk about my career, you talk about often the financial results. You have Cava, which has been the most successful food service IPO of the last 5 years, arguably. Now, a company worth $7 billion, was worth as much as 15 billion, but it's up three, fourfold from its IPO year and a half ago. Um, you talk about Panera. Panera was the best performing restaurant stock over two decades. Its last two decades um produced 25% IRR. uh in fact somebody told me we we actually beat Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.</p>
</details>

人们谈论财务表现，但那并不是让我兴奋的部分，也不是我真正感受到的部分。那只是一个副产品，是真正令人兴奋的事情——学习与转型——的一种体现。在我们的历史进程中，大约有三、四，或许五个关键的学习时刻，大约每五年出现一次，它们导致了巨大的转型。正是领悟、弄清楚、看到并品尝到这些，才是我所热爱的。对我来说，这才是真正的工作所在：用同理心去理解机会在哪里，然后有纪律地不仅去理解它，还要把它构建到一个组织中并付诸实施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You you know people talk about the financial performance but that's not the part that gets me excited. That's not the part that I actually feel. That's a byproduct or manifestation of what really was exciting which is learning and transforming. And so over the course of our history and I can I can take you through this but there were three or four maybe five key learnings that broke maybe every five years that led to massive transformation. And it was actually getting that and figuring it out and seeing it and tasting it that I loved. Um, that to me was where the real work was to to understand that with empathy what the opportunity was and then to have the the the discipline to go in not just understand it but actually build that into an organization and put that in place.</p>
</tought>
### Panera 的四次关键转型

我们可以一直追溯到我职业生涯的开端。我从波士顿市中心的一家小饼干店起步。那家饼干店带来了一个机会，让我参与到另一家名为 Au Bon Pain 的公司。当时，每天有 5 万人从那家店门口经过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we can go all the way back to the initiation of my career. I started it with a single cookie store in downtown Boston. That cookie store led to um an opportunity to become involved in another company called Au Bon Pain. Essentially, there were 50,000 people a day walking by that store.</p>
</details>

那家饼干店，中午 12 点前没人买饼干。所以我们决定加入法式烘焙产品。我们成了这家名为 Au Bon Pain 公司的特许经营商。当时我并不知道，Au Bon Pain 其实是一家法式面包制造商。他们开了 13 家店，关了 10 家，负债约 300 万美元，实际上已经破产了。我在波士顿市中心的一个街区成了他们的特许经营商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The cookie store. Nobody bought cookies before 12 noon. So, we made a decision um to put in French baked goods. We became a licensee of this company called Au Bon Pain. I didn't know at that time but Au Bon Pain was really a French bread manufacturer. Um they had opened 13 stores and closed 10 of them had about three million in debt and were functionally bankrupt. And uh I became their licensee in this one square block area in downtown Boston.</p>
</details>

作为一名经营者，我知道我的供应商哪些好，哪些不好。他们简直一团糟。有时给我开账单，有时不开。有时送货，有时不送。我敢肯定，直到今天我还欠他们钱。但这个故事的重点只是想说，他们问题很多。我看到了将我在饼干业务中学到的东西应用到法式烘焙业务中的机会，这促成了一次合并。我们拿了公司 60% 的股份，他们保留了 40%，然后进行了分拆。

<p class="english-text">And I I can tell you as an operator I know which of my vendors are any good and which aren't. They were so out of control. Sometimes they build me, sometimes they didn't. Sometimes they delivered, sometimes they didn't. I'm sure to this day I still owe money. But the point of the story is simply to say they had a lot of issues. I saw the opportunity to apply what I'd learned in the cookie business to the French bakery business and it led to a merger. Uh we took 60% of the company and they kept 40% and then split it up.</p>
</details>

我们成立的公司 Au Bon Pain Co., Inc.，包括我的饼干店和他们的三家法式面包店，最终在 2017 年以 78 亿美元的价格售出。但故事的关键在于，我们真正弄明白的第一件事是 Au Bon Pain 所代表的可能性和机遇。我会在柜台工作，顾客走进来会说：“我想要那个法棍面包。”我说：“好的。”他们会说：“切一下。”我开始切，你知道怎么切面包吧？像这样横着切。他们会说：“不，从上到下竖着切。”我照做了，把法棍递给他们，他们会从超市袋子里拿出一小包东西，放上一些博尔斯因奶酪和烤牛肉，或者烟熏火鸡。

<p class="english-text">That company Au Bon Pain Co., Inc., which we formed was my cookie store and there are three French bakeries was the company we ended up literally selling for $7.8 billion in 2017. But the point of the story is the first thing that we actually really figured out was the possibility, the opportunity of what Au Bon Pain represented. And I would be working on the counter and customers would walk in and say, "I want that baguette." And I'd say, "Sure." And they'd say, "Slice it." I start to slice it. You know how you slice bread? You slice it like this. And they say, "No, slice it from top to bottom." I'd do so. and I'd hand them the the baguette chain and they'd pull out a little bag from a supermarket and they they put some boursin and roast beef on or smoked turkey.</p>

你不需要是营销奇才就能明白，他们真正关心的是三明治，他们想要的是一种平台，而不是面包本身。我们开始思考，也许顾客想雇我们做的工作，其实是给他们做三明治、做沙拉，把可颂面包当作一个平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and again you didn't have to be a marketing wiz to say wait a second what they really care about the job they want is a sandwich they want something it's not the bread they want itself it's how that forms a platform for something else and we began to say maybe the opportunity The job we wanted they that the customer wanted to hire us for was actually to make him the sandwich, make him the salad, use the croissant bread as a platform.</p>
</details>

坦白说，这在现在看来不算什么启示，但我们开始围绕这个想法重建这个概念。很快，这家濒临破产的公司 Au Bon Pain 开始腾飞。当我们开始销售三明治和可颂时，这是一种升级的食物体验，人们非常喜欢。这家破败的小公司在六到八年内迅速崛起。它成为了北美各地购物中心的一个品类。从百事可乐到莎莉集团，所有人都试图挑战我们、收购我们或把我们挤出市场。到 1991 年，这种模式的成果就是我们上市了，基于法式面包咖啡馆的概念，而不仅仅是法式面包店。这是第一次学习，那次充满同理心的观察，看到了产品不仅仅是其本身，而是一个平台的巨大力量，这催生了一个非常成功的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And straight up um again doesn't seem like a a revelation now, but we began to rebuild this concept around that idea. And very quickly this broken bankrupt company, Au Bon Pain, started taking off. And when we were selling sandwiches and and and croissant, it was an elevated food experience. People loved it. And this broken down little company in the course of six, eight years took off. Uh it became a uh category in malls across North America. We had everybody from Pepsi and Sarah Lee um attempt to take us on or buy us out or take it take us out. By 1991, the manifestation of that was we went public based on this this model of a French bakery cafe as opposed to just a French bakery. That was one learning that that that observation that empathetic observation of the power of of the product not as an end in and of itself but as a platform that led to a powerfully successful concept.</p>
</details>

同样的事情在 93 年再次发生。Au Bon Pain 的有机增长开始乏力。如果你在一家上市公司，而且我参与过多家上市公司，你会知道，公司的大部分估值来自于其增长潜力，你必须实现这种增长。在 90 年代初，我很清楚 Au Bon Pain 的增长是有限的。它在波士顿、纽约、华盛顿、芝加哥表现很好，但在洛杉矶的购物中心行不通，在密苏里州的购物中心也不行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The same thing happened again by 93. Au Bon Pain was beginning to run out of organic growth and the one thing if you're in a public company and I've been involved in any number of public companies most of its valuation is generated by its possibility of growth and you have to actually deliver that and it was very clear to me in the early 90s that Au Bon Pain was limited in its growth. It was great in Boston, New York, DC, Chicago, but it didn't work in the malls in LA. It didn't work in the malls in in Missouri.</p>
</details>

我们最终进行了后向整合，并建立了庞大的国际业务。我们想，如果我们在美国高密度城市餐饮领域是最好的，那么国外的机会比美国本土更多。我们还开始建立制造业业务。我们一直拥有制造技能，并在中西部建造了当时最大的冷冻面团工厂。然后，我收购了圣路易斯一家名为 St. Louis Bread Company 的 19 家门店连锁店。当时，我把它看作是进入郊区市场的门户。Au Bon Pain 负责城市，St. Louis Bread Company 可以负责郊区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we ended up backward integrating and we ended up building a big international business. We said if we're the best in the United States at high density urban feeding, there's more opportunities abroad than just the United States. We also began building a manufacturing business. We had uh had always had manufacturing skills and built what was the at that time the largest frozen dough plant ever built in the the Midwest. And then I I ended up buying um a little 19-store chain in St. Louis called the St. Louis Bread Company. And I saw that again at that time as a a gateway to the suburban marketplace. Au Bon Pain would be urban. Uh the St. Louis Bread Company could be suburban.</p>
</details>

这很有趣。大约在 93、94、95 年，我通过一个盈利对赌协议来运营它。我开始和 Scott Davis、Dwight Juen 这样的人一起周游全国。他们是我的同事，我从他们身上学到很多。我们开始看到那些想要更多东西的消费者。很明显，市场上存在一个非常独特的消费群体，他们想要更好的东西。我们开始试图理解这一点。你问我是怎么做到的，就是去西海岸、东海岸旅行，去加拿大的温哥华，看 Mikey 和 Terra Breads 做的美味面包。我们试图找出谁是满足顾客需求的佼佼者，以及为什么人们从那些地方出来时会面带微笑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And and and it was interesting. And it was at that point, this would have been 93, 94, 95, I I ran it through an earnout, I I began traveling the country with guy named Scott Davis, another guy named Dwight Juen. These were uh people that worked with me, colleagues who I thought, you know, I learned from. And we began seeing these consumers who wanted something more. And it was very clear that there was this very distinct consumer niche out there that wanted something better. And we began to to try to make sense of it. And again, you ask me how we did it. It was traveling into the west coast, the east coast, went up to Vancouver in Canada, Mikey and Terra breads, amazing bread he was doing up there. And we're trying to find out who are the best people um that were meeting customer needs and why were people smiling when they came out of there.</p>
</details>

正是从这些经历中，我们开始领悟。我记得和 Scott Davis、Dwight Juen 这两个人坐在酒吧里。Dwight 是我的研究员，他说：“你知道吗，如果你真的想了解今天的消费者，就看看他们的啤酒瓶。上面的标签就是人们如何看待自己的镜子。我们的机会就是让我们的食物也做到同样的事情，给人们一种他们是谁、他们是什么的感觉。”我开始理解了。对我来说，这里强大的主题是试图在噪音中寻找信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was from that that we essentially began to get it. And I can I can I can remember um sitting in a in a a bar with these two guys, Scott Davis and Dwight Juen. And and Dwight was my researcher. And Dwight said, "You know, you really want to understand today's consumer? Look at their beer bottle. That label on it is a mirror for who people perceive themselves to be. And our opportunity is for our food to do the same thing, to give people a sense of who they were and what they are. And you know, I began to to make sense of it. And again, for me, the the the the powerful theme here is trying to search for what is the the signal versus the noise.</p>
</details>

你知道，有这么多信息向你涌来，但真正重要的是什么？什么是更深层次的趋势？当我周游全国，观察人们对快餐的焦虑，他们对速度的需求，但同时又对品质有需求，对能提升自我感觉的体验有需求时，我开始理解一个更深层次的主题。二战后，所有的食物都是本地的。但快进到 1990 年，几乎所有主要的消费品类都被商品化了，变成了寡头垄断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know what really matters because there's all this stuff coming at you but what are the deeper trends and what had become clear to me as I was traveling the country and watching people and their angst around fast food their need for speed but their need for quality their need for an experience that elevated them as I was doing that I began to understand a deeper theme post World War II all food was local but you fast forward that In 1990, almost every major consumer category had been commodified. It had been turned into an oligopoly.</p>
</detais>

以啤酒为例，曾经都是本地啤酒，后来变成了安海斯-布希（Anheuser-Busch）和米勒（Miller）。再看咖啡，也曾是本地咖啡烘焙商，后来演变成了福爵（Folgers）和麦斯威尔（Maxwell House）。还有软饮料，曾经是本地制造商，后来变成了可口可乐和百事可乐。每一个行动都会引起反作用，这就是更深层次的趋势。我们开始在不同的消费品类中看到人们觉醒，说：“我不想成为大众市场的一部分，我想在一个让我感觉不到特别的世界里感到特别。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can take beer. It had all once been local beer. It was Anheuser-Busch and Miller. You can take coffee. It was also again once local coffee roasters that had morphed into um Folgers and and and Maxwell House. You can take um soft drinks. once had been local soft drink manufacturers that had become Coke and Pepsi and every action draws a reaction and that's the deeper trend and we began to see in different consumer categories people waking up and saying you know I don't want to be part of a mass market I want to feel special in a world in which I don't.</p>
</details>

你开始看到精酿啤酒厂的发展。我在波士顿的好朋友 Jim Cook 创办了 Samuel Adams 啤酒，这就是对市场变化的回应。我们在咖啡领域也看到了同样的情况，精品咖啡兴起。想当年，如果你周五晚上来我家吃饭，我会给你上福爵咖啡。今天，如果我不用昂贵的意式咖啡机或意式浓缩咖啡，就好像在侮辱你一样。这就是更深层次的趋势：人们想要感觉特别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you started to see the development of craft breweries and beer good friend of mine in Boston Jim uh Cook um did Samuel Adams uh you know it was an answer to what um had happened to the marketplace. We saw the same thing with coffee with the growth of specialty coffee. I mean back then if you came to my house for dinner on Friday night I'd serve you folders. Today if I don't use a you know an expensive espresso machine I'm or an espresso I'm somehow insulting you. That was the deeper trend. People wanted to feel special.</p>
</details>

饮料领域也是如此。可口可乐和百事可乐演变成了 Snapple，再到 Al Waldo，现在你走进一家便利店，会看到几百种不同的饮料品牌。关键在于，我们在食品领域也看到了同样的机会。曾经，所有的食物都是本地的，后来被商品化为快餐。而巨大的机会在于特色食品，在于用传统方式制作的食品，在于人们尊重的、用好原料制作的食品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You saw the same thing with beverages. Coke and Pepsi morphed into Snapple into Al Waldo and now you walk into a convenience store, you're going to see a couple hundred different beverage brands. The point of it is we saw the same thing, the same opportunity happening in food. At one time, all food had been local and had been commoditized into fast food. And the powerful opportunity was for specialty food, for food that was done the way it had been done, for food that people respected with ingredients.</p>
</details>

我们开始看到这种力量，并发现烘焙业也发生了同样的事情。曾经，烘焙都是本地的，在整合和商品化过程中，变成了 99 美分三个面包。但到了 90 年代初，一些消费者开始觉醒，说：“我想要像我祖父母那样做的面包，没有化学品，没有防腐剂，用石板烤炉烤。”我们开始意识到，在所谓的特色食品领域存在着巨大的机会，而没有比特色面包店更强大的平台来竞争了。将这两者结合起来，就成了我们对现在所谓的“快餐休闲”概念的体现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we began to see the power of that and saw the same thing happening with bakery. One time bakery had all been local in the consolidation, the commodification that had become three lows for 99. And by the early '90s, some consumers were waking up and saying, "I want it done the way my grandparents did it. no chemicals, no preservatives, stone deck ovens. And we began to say, there's a powerful opportunity in, shall we say, specialty food, and there's no more powerful platform to compete with that than a specialty bakery. And putting those two together became our manifestation of what we could do as now called fast casual concept.</p>
</details>

所以，同样地，我看到了，我能感觉到，我能品尝到。机会就在于去实现它。这导致了第二次转型。第二次转型最终是将特色食品的原则应用到我们的一个概念中。我开始把它应用到我们持有的一个名为 St. Louis Bread Company 的概念上。我们对其进行了彻底的重建。我们把那个年销售额约 100 万美元的店——它基本上是一个以面包为特色的三明治店——增加了早餐业务，以酸面包圈为特色。业务额从 100 万跃升至 125 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so again, same thing. I saw it, I could see it, I could taste it. And it was the opportunity to go put that in place. We should come back to what the objective of all this is in a second. But that led to that second transformation. And the second transformation ultimately was to apply those principles of a specialty food to one of our concepts. And I began to apply it to this one concept we held called St. Louis Bread Company. And we literally completely rebuilt it. We took that unit that was doing about a million dollars a year. It was basically a a a sandwich place in which the bread was the differentiator. And we added a breakfast business rooted in sourdough bagels. And the business popped from a million to a million-250.</p>
</details>

然后，我们为门店创造了一个完全不同的环境。一个你想坐下来的地方。一位名叫 Terry Heckler 的出色设计师，他为我们设计了 logo，也设计了星巴克最初的 logo，他来自西雅图，已经去世了，但他在其中起到了关键作用。我们创造了一种欢迎你、邀请你的环境。我过去称之为“视觉糖果”。无论你坐在哪里，都能看到一些东西。我们软化了环境，让它变得舒适，让它成为一个你愿意待的地方。我们把这个理念应用到我们的门店中。很快，我们的销售额从 125 万跃升至 175 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we came in and created a whole different environment for the store. A place that you wanted to sit. a wonderful wonderful designer named Terry Heckler who actually did our logo and did the original Starbucks logo out of out of Seattle who's since passed away but but he was instrumental in that and we created a kind of environment that welcomed you and invited you. I used to call it visual candy. Wherever you sat, you you saw something and we we we we softened the environment. We made it comfortable. We made it a place you wanted to be and we put that into place into our stores. Very quickly our volumes popped from a million-250 up to a million-750.</p>
</details>

我们开始明白，我们实际上在做另一门生意，一个聚会场所的生意，为人们提供一个可以交流、见面、联系的地方。足球妈妈、圣经小组、医药代表、面试的人、报税的人。我们创造了这些环境。这再次体现了我们对“人们想在一个让他们感觉不到特别的世界里感到特别”这一点的理解。Panera 成为了这种理念的典范，我们把它发展壮大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we began to understand that we were actually playing in another business, a gathering place business offering an opportunity for a place people could go to to touch base, to see each other, to connect. Soccer moms, Bible groups, pharma reps, folks doing interviews, people doing their taxes. And we created these environments. And again, this is the manifestation of this understanding that people wanted to feel special in a world in which they didn't. And Panera became the poster child for that. And we built that out.</p>
</details>

这导致了第三次学习和转型。到 98、99 年，我感到非常沮丧。我当时在经营一家大型上市公司，有四个部门：Au Bon Pain、Au Bon Pain 制造、Au Bon Pain 国际，以及第四个部门，St. Louis Bread Company，我们后来把它改名为 Panera。改名的原因又是另一个故事了，但它被改名为 Panera Bread。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that led to a third learning and transformation. By '98, '99, I was feeling some real frustration. I was running a big public company. We had four divisions at that time. Au Bon Pain, Au Bon Pain Manufacturing, Au Bon Pain International, and this fourth division, St. Louis Bread Company, that we had renamed Panera. That's a whole another story why we did it. But it was renamed Panera Bread.</p>
</details>

当时我在加勒比海的一个海滩上和朋友在一起，我向他抱怨：“你知道，每个人都在争吵，每个人都对我生气。Au Bon Pain 的人对我生气，因为我试图把他们的资本转移到 Panera 这个增长项目上。国际部的人不想打电话回家，制造部的人则想不通为什么他们会在一家零售公司里。”我们每个部门都有职业经理人。我说：“奇怪的是，Panera 这个项目，虽然是我们公司第三大的，但它不是最大的，也不是挂在门上的名字。门上的名字是 Au Bon Pain，那是上市公司。但这东西有潜力成为一个全国性的主导公司。每一千个说要做的人里，只有一个能做到。很明显我们有这个机会。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm on a beach down in the Caribbean with a friend. And I'm lamenting this friend. You know, everybody's fighting. Everybody's angry at me. The guys at Au Bon Pain are angry at me. Why am I trying to take their capital and shift it to this growth thing Panera? The guys in international didn't want to call home and the guys in manufacturer were trying to figure out why they were in a retail company. Any rate, we had professional managers and everyone and and I was I said this strange you know the real the real shame here this thing Panera even though it's the third biggest of our company it's not the largest. It's not the name on the door. The name of the door was Au Bon Pain that was the public company. I said, 'This thing has the potential to be a nationally dominant company. For every thousand people say it, one ever makes it. And it was pretty clear that we we had that opportunity.</p>
</details>

我说：“你知道吗？我们会把它搞砸的。我们不会给它足够的资本，不会给它足够的人力资源，让它达到应有的高度。”我的朋友看着我说：“Ron，如果公司的名字是 Panera，Panera 拥有其他所有业务，那会如何改变你的想法？”我看着朋友，说：“哇，我从没这么想过。如果我有胆量，如果公司真的是 Panera，我会把所有其他资产变现，拿走财务资本，也拿走人力资本，最优秀的人才，然后我会去把这件事做成，因为这家公司最宝贵的财富就是那个部门。而它实现潜力的最大风险，就是我们没有给它成长所需的一切。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I said, you know what? We're going to screw it up. We're not going to give it the capital. We're not going to give it the human resources to get it where it needs to go. And my friend looked at me and said, "Ron, what would you do if the name of the company was Panera? Panera owned everything else. How would that change the way you thought?" And I looked at my friend, I said, 'Wow, I'd never thought of it that way. If I had any guts, if I had if it was really Panera, I would monetize every other asset, take the financial capital, and I'd also take the human capital, the best people, and I'd go down there and I'd make this happen because the greatest gem in this company was that division. And the greatest risk to to its possibility, its potential, was that we didn't give it what it needed to actually grow and become what it could be.</p>
</details>

我就是那种人，如果我说我要做，我通常就会去做。我得对自己负责。我回去两个月后，向董事会提交了一份提案，建议出售所有其他业务，把全部赌注押在这个 Panera Bread 部门上。当时我并不控股，那绝对是一个非常艰难的处境，但最终他们给了我空间去做。我做了，这导致了我人生中最糟糕的一年半。我卖掉了所有其他部门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I thought about I'm this kind of guy if I say I'm going to do it, I often go do it. I want to live with myself. And I went off and and and came back two months later and went to my board with a proposal to sell every other business and bet the whole thing on this Panera Bread division. you know, I didn't control the company at that point and that was a definitely a very tough situation, but ultimately um they gave me the room to do it. I did it. It led to the worst year and a half of my life. I sold every other division.</p>
</details>

这些不仅仅是生意，它们是……你知道，Au Bon Pain 是我的第一个孩子。我的孩子们都知道，它是我的一部分。那些是我曾与之一同流汗、流血、我深爱的人。好消息是，他们中的大多数人在竞业协议到期后最终都回来为我们工作了。但我们卖掉了 Au Bon Pain 和 Au Bon Pain 国际，卖掉了制造业务，到 99 年，我手上只剩下 Panera Bread 和一大笔现金，以及一个潜力无限的业务。然后我开始努力实现这个潜力。我们把它从几百家店发展到 2000 家餐厅，到那个十年末我们已经非常接近这个数字了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um these aren't just businesses. These were, you know, the Au Bon Pain was my first child. My kids know that, you know, I mean, it was a part of me. These were people I had sweated with and bled with and I loved. The good news is most of them ultimately came back to work for us when their non-competes were over. But we sold the you know Au Bon Pain in Au Bon Pain International. We sold the manufacturing business and by 99 I ended up with Panera Bread and a whole bunch of cash and and a business that had extraordinary potential. And then I went to work to help make that happen. And we took it from what a couple of hundred stores up to 2,000 restaurants. We're very close to it by the end of that decade.</p>
</details>

这又导致了下一次转型，因为转型是一波接一波的。到 2008、2009 年，我个人感觉需要转型。我想知道我是否能将我学到的关于长期思维的强大经验应用到更广泛的公民社会中。我曾参与奥巴马的竞选活动，当时有过一些关于加入政府的讨论，但我无法放弃对 Panera 的承诺。我决定以某种方式去做这件事，同时我也有一个愿望，想测试一个我一直在构思的想法，叫做“Panera Cares”，一个“共同责任咖啡馆”，那里没有固定价格，是对人性的考验。人们可以进来，那是另一个完整的故事了。但我想测试这些“共同责任咖啡馆”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that led again to the the the next transformation cuz they they come in waves. And by 2008 2009, I personally was feeling that I wanted transformation. I wanted to understand if I could take these powerful lessons I learned about long-term thinking and actually apply them in a a broader civic society. I had been involved with the Obama campaign and there had been some discussion of of joining the administration and I was unable to give him my commitment to Panera and I decided I wanted to go do this in some way and I also had a a desire to test out an idea I had been working on which was something called Panera Cares cafes of shared responsibility where there would be no set prices. It was a test of humanity. people come in and it's another whole story. But I wanted to test out these these cafes of shared responsibility.</p>
</details>

所以在 2008、2009 年，我辞去了 CEO 的职务。我试图把那个机会当作从高台跳板上跳下，去真正体验入水的感觉。我花了一年到一年半的时间创建 Panera Cares，做了一堆政治方面的事情。我是美国一个名为“无标签”（No Labels）组织的八九个联合创始人之一，该组织旨在减少华盛顿的极端党派之争和两极分化，让我们专注于长期思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in 2008 2009 I stepped down as CEO. I tried to take that opportunity as jumping off a high dive board to actually learn what it felt to go in the water and I spent about a year a year and a half um creating Panera Cares doing a bunch of political things. I was one of the eight or nine people that co-founded a group called No Labels here in the United States, which is meant to reduce the hyperpartisanship in DC, the polarization, and focus us on long-term thinking.</p>
</details>

同样，这关乎发现机会。我当时仍然是 Panera 的执行主席和最大股东，我做了很多并购和一些消费者方面的工作。有一次我从西海岸出差回来，一个周末后，我决定写一份宣言，阐述如果我不是 Panera 的一员，我会如何与 Panera 竞争。我会说我将如何“搞乱”Panera，但实际上是如何挑战它？如何超越它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, you it's about seeing opportunity. I had the chance to to return um from the West Coast. I was still the executive chairman of Panera and the largest shareholder and I did a lot of the M&A work and some of the consumer work and I came back from a trip after a weekend and I essentially decided I wanted to write a a manifesto for how I would I would compete with Panera if I weren't part of Panera. I would say how I would screw with Panera, but but how would you take it on? How would you best it?</p>
</details>

当时，我呼吁实现完全的数字化接入，这在餐饮业还不存在。我们稍后可以多谈谈这个。我呼吁建立所谓的忠诚度计划，这在当时也不存在。它实际上是在英国由一家叫 Tesco 的公司发展起来，然后通过 Kroger 进入美国，即区别对待你最好的顾客。我呼吁清洁食品，一种不同的饮食方式和理念。我基本上呼吁全渠道。我把这份关于 Panera 彻底转型的愿景交给了当时已成为 CEO 的 Bill Morton。Bill 是我非常亲密的朋友，共事 20 年的同事。他看着我说：“哇。”他说：“我没人手来做这个。你愿意来做吗？”我说：“好啊，我会玩得很开心的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I essentially at that time called for for complete digital access which didn't exist in the restaurant industry. We can talk more about that. I called for something called loyalty which again didn't exist. It's become prevalent in the industry. Uh it had actually been developed in the UK with a company called Tesco and came through Kroger in the United States where your best customers were treated different differently. I called for clean food, a different approach to eating and how you might eat. And I essentially called for omni channel and I I I handed in this vision um for a radical transformation of Panera to Bill Morton who'd become the CEO. And Bill was my very dear friend, 20-year colleague, and looked at me and said, "Wow." He said, "I don't have anybody to work on this. Would you go work on it?" And I said, "Yeah, I'll have some fun with it."</p>
</details>

一年后，花了 2500 万美元，这位执行主席每周工作 80 小时，致力于这个通过整合技术改变顾客体验的愿景，改变整个局面。我非常享受这个过程。我没有当 CEO 的那些仪式性职责，不必告诉别人我刚做了什么，也不必告诉他们我将要做什么，我只专注于产品。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And $25 million later in another year, the the the executive chairman is working 80 hours a week on this vision for how to have integrated technology changed the guest experience. Changed the the whole deal. I was loving it. I had none of the ceremonial duties of being a CEO. I didn't have to tell people what I just did. I don't have to tell them what I was going to do. I just was dealing with the product.</p>
</details>

后来 Bill 来找我，说他个人遇到了问题，家里出了点事，他不能出差了。他说也许我们应该让你再当 CEO，他自己退下来。我们讨论了这件事，因为这不一定是我想要的，但在某个时刻似乎是必要的。大约九个月或一年后，我们执行了这个计划，我们只是交换了职位，他成了执行副主席，我再次成为 CEO。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um Bill came to me and said he personally had a problem. He couldn't travel. something had happened in his family and he said maybe we should make you CEO again and I should step down and we debated it because it wasn't what I wanted necessarily but it seemed to be necessary at a certain point and maybe nine months or a year later we we executed that we just swapped positions he became executive vice chairman and I became a CEO again.</p>
</details>

我把这个愿景付诸实施。这听起来很美好，但它导致了我能想象到的最糟糕的三年。激进投资者攻击我，我花了 1.5 亿美元在技术上。我曾把技术比作一个时代的社会保障，它占我们收入的 100% 只是时间问题。我们真的在投资它，你不知道终点在哪里。我们最终不得不改造一切。我们不仅改造了技术，还改造了我们与顾客打交道的方式，我们的概念核心。我们改造了大部分高级管理团队，因为公司成长了，需求和要求也变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I put this in place and again it it all sounds lovely but it led to the worst three years I can ever imagine. I had activist investors attack me. I spent $150 million on technology. I used to refer to technology as a social security of an era. It was only a matter of time till it was 100% of our revenue. I that was we were really investing in it and you didn't know where it would end and we ended up having to transform everything. We transformed not just technology but we transformed how we how we dealt with the guest what our our our concept essence was. Um we transformed much of the senior management team this company had had grown and its needs and its requirements.</p>
</details>

最终，这成为了行业内最大规模的转型之一，并且有了自己的生命力。坦白说，我能看到一个更好的 Panera 的机会，它不再像过去 20 年那样竞争，而是与消费者可能想要的东西竞争。然后就是艰苦的工作，把它变为现实。到 2017 年，它奏效了。我们的**息税折旧及摊销前利润**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 一种衡量公司核心盈利能力的财务指标）增长了 35%，我们的同店销售额接近两位数增长。一家欧洲的基金管理公司 JAB 看上了 Panera，他们想收购它。虽然我从未打算出售，但当有人爱上你的东西，并且愿意为此付出代价时，我有什么理由拒绝呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately this became one of the largest transformations in the industry and it took on a life of its own. And again, straight up, I could see the opportunity for a better Panera that was not competing the way it had competed for the prior 20 years, but was competing against what the possibility was of what the consumer wanted. And then came the hard work of actually putting that into existence. And by 2017, it was working. Our EBITDA was up 35%. Our comparable store sales were were pushing double digits. And we had a European money manager uh JAB who came along and fell in love with Panera and they wanted to buy it. And though I was never selling it, it wasn't my intention. Uh you know, when somebody falls in love, who is it for me to deny them what they wanted if they were willing to pay for it?</p>
</details>

他们付了钱。这笔 78 亿美元的交易，在当时是美国有史以来最大或第二大的餐厅交易，估值倍数也是最高的之一。这似乎是一个机会，为所有相信我们的人收获我们努力的成果。我们抓住了这个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they they paid for it. And what at that time was the largest or second largest US restaurant deal ever done, $7.8 billion. at among the highest multiples. And you know, again, it seemed like an opportunity to harvest everything that we had worked on for a lot of people that had believed in us. And we we took that opportunity.</p>
</details>

### 第三幕：Act III 的投资哲学

那么，接下来到 Cava 的主要转折点是什么？这很有趣。我离开 Panera 后，一直对其他一些小生意感兴趣。离开后，我做了很多关于美国资本市场普遍存在的短期主义的演讲，探讨这不仅影响我们的政治体，也影响我们的资本市场，以及这如何最终削弱了我们的竞争力，不利于我们的 GDP 增长。如果我们不进行长期思考，就不会有创新。如果我们只想要股价上涨，那么驱动它的就是短期的成本削减。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then what are the major clicks to get us to Cava? Now, you know, it's interesting. So, I I I left Panera. I had always had interest in a number of other little businesses and I was doing after I left I was doing a lot of speaking on the pervasive short-termism in the US capital markets and how not just our our body politic but our capital markets and how that was essentially making us less competitive. It was it was not helping our GDP growth. If we're not thinking long term we're not going to have innovation. If all we want is is to pop the stock, it's short-term cost cutting that drives it.</p>
</details>

我的一位同事，Kee Pasco，曾在 Panera 与我共事，他说：“你为什么不拿出自己的钱，言行一致呢？”我最终拿出了大约 2 亿美元的自有资金，没有**有限合伙人**（Limited Partner: 在合伙企业中只承担有限责任的投资者，通常不参与日常管理），没有外部人士，只有我自己的钱和一些合伙人的钱。我带上了一些曾与我共事的人，决定去做这件事。我创建了一个投资载体，因为它不是一家公司，叫做 Act III。你可以猜到这个名字的来历：Au Bon Pain，Panera，现在是第三幕（Act III Holdings）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of my my associates, a guy named Kee Pasco. Oh, I had worked with me at Panera said, "Why don't you take your own money and put your money where your mouth is?" And I ultimately took roughly $200 million of my own money. No LPs, no external folks, just my own money and a bit of money from some of my partners. um some of the people that chose to join us and took some of the people I had worked with and decided to go do it and essentially I created a investment vehicle because it's not a firm it's called act three you can figure out where that comes from Au Bon Pain Panera and now Act III Holdings.</p>
</details>

离开 Panera 八周内，我们就参与了第一个真正的交易，那就是 Cava。当 Cava 只有两家餐厅时，我就已经是它的投资者了，只是小额投资。我离开 Panera 后，他们问我是否愿意加入他们的董事会。另一家名为 Zoës Kitchen 的上市公司也问我是否愿意加入他们的董事会。我很清楚地看到并品尝到了那个机会。地中海风味很有潜力，它是美国排名第一的饮食方式，口味大胆，与众不同但又易于接受。你可以看出这是一个强大的渠道，背后有许多顺风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and within eight weeks of of of leaving Panera had gotten involved in our first really real deal which was Cava I had been an investor in Cava uh uh when it was two restaurants, just a little something. And after I left Panera, they asked me if I joined their board. Another company called Zoës had asked me if I joined their board. Uh they were a public company and you know, and it was very clear to me again, I could see and taste that opportunity. Mediterranean had power. It was the number one diet in America. It was bold flavors. It was different but accessible. And you could tell this was a a powerful channel with lots of winds at its back the channel.</p>
</details>

我开始思考谁有潜力主导这个市场？是 Zoës 还是 Cava？当时 Zoës 的规模是 Cava 的五倍，但 Cava 的单店销售额更高，概念也更好。我开始想，我应该收购 Zoës。当时它是一家市值三四亿美元的上市公司，从十亿美元跌下来的。与其为他们出谋划策，不如直接买下来，然后与 Cava 合并。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I began to say who has the potential to dominate? Is it Zoe's or Cava? And again, these folks at Zoës were were five times the size of Cava, but Cava was doing higher volumes and was a better concept. I started to think to myself, you know what? What I should do is buy the Zoës. I think it was a three or 400 million dollar public company at that point from a billion dollars, you know, instead of figuring out for them buy it and then merge it in with Cava.</p>
</details>

唯一的问题是我得把这个想法告诉 Cava，他们正想让我加入董事会。我向 Cava 的出色 CEO Brett Schulman 透露了这个消息。Brett 说：“哇，好吧，这是个有趣的想法。”他说：“在你加入董事会之前，也许你想跟他们谈谈这个。”于是我向他们的董事会提出了这个想法。他们很明智，我必须坦白说，他们理解了这个想法，也理解了在地中海品类中建立一个主导品牌的威力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the one problem is I had to tell that to Cava who wanted me to join their board. And I I broke the news to Brett Schulman, who is the this wonderful CEO down at Cava. And Brett said, "Wow, okay, that's an interesting idea." And he said, "Before you join the board, maybe you want to tell them about this." And I I went and basically pitched their board on this idea. And in their wisdom, I must be be straight, they understood it and they understood the power of building a a dominant brand in the Mediterranean category.</p>
</details>

我同意为这次收购提供大部分资金并帮助领导它，这也起到了作用。最终的结果是，不是我收购 Zoës，而是我们决定让 Cava 收购 Zoës，然后我们帮助他们完成转型。赌注是，通过收购一家规模大五倍的公司，我们可以运用我们的纪律、技能和烹饪技巧，最终成为这个品类的主导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um it helped that I agreed to essentially finance um a large part of the acquisition and to to help lead it. But what it amounted to was instead of me buying Zoe's, we decided to have Cava buy Zoe's and then we would help them make that transformation. And here was the bet that by buying a company five times larger, we could apply our discipline, our skills, our culinary skills um to end up with the dominant player in this category.</p>
</details>

Act III 的理论是，我们押注于有顺风的品类，然后努力在该品类中建立主导者。我所在的行业是一个赢家通吃的行业。想想麦当劳和汉堡王，Panera 和 Corner Bakery，Chipotle 和 Qdoba。所有的价值创造都倾向于那些能够建立大规模业务的公司。如果你拥有主导地位，并且是一个更好的竞争选择，你就会赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the the thesis um step back, but the thesis behind act three is we bet on categories that have tailwinds and then we endeavor to build the dominant player in that category. Um my industry is an industry of winner take all. Think McDonald's and Burger King. Think Panera and Corner Bakery, Chipotle, Quidoba. All of the the value creation tends to um happen for those that are building something of large scale. and and and if you have that that dominant position and you're a better competitive alternative, you win.</p>
</details>

我们在 Cava 看到了这个机会，这促使我们进行了那次收购。从那时起，Cava 几乎一夜之间从 50 家餐厅增长到 300 家，尽管交易花了 6 个月时间。这导致了非常艰难的 2019 年，因为公司还没有为此做好准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we saw that opportunity in Cava. And that's what led us to to make that acquisition. And at that point, Cava went almost overnight. So it took us 6 months to do the deal, but from 50 restaurants to 300. And it led to a very, very tough 2019 because the company wasn't prepared or ready for it.</p>
</details>

Act III Holdings 的一个特点是，我们有能力提供帮助。我有七八个合伙人，没有一个是搞金融的。只有一个金融人士，他实际上是曾经攻击我的那个激进投资者。我当时不能告诉任何人，我其实觉得他很聪明并且喜欢他。但不管怎样，我确实这么觉得，他后来作为我们的 CFO 加入了我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the things about ACT III Holdings, we're we're able I have um seven or eight partners. Not one of them is a financial guy. There's only one financial guy in the mix who was actually the activist who attacked me. I couldn't tell anybody at the time that I actually thought he was smart and liked him. But at any rate, I did. And um he joined us as our CFO.</p>
</details>

我有一个合伙人，和我共事了 20 多年，他负责我们所有最深入的研究和战略思考。他就是那个真正帮助我发展出“快餐休闲”理念的人。我过去常说，他的思想通过我的嘴巴说出来，但他才是那个真正推动我深入思考的人。他现在和我们在一起。我还有另一个合伙人，他开过 5000 家零售店。还有一个合伙人，他从 Darden 集团成长起来，曾是 Dairy Queen 和 Bruegger's Bagels 的总裁，也曾是我的首席运营官，他真正懂得如何有纪律地扩张和建立这些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know I have one partner that was the has been with me for 20 odd years who does all our deepest research and strategic thinking. He was the guy who was really helped me develop fast casual and that ideology. I used to say from from his brain to my lips I speak it but he was the guy who really pushed me hard on on thinking he's with us. I have another partner who's opened 5,000 retail locations. I have another partner who came up through Darden was president of Dairy Queen, the president of um Bruegger's Bagels, uh was my COO is a guy who really understands discipline scaling and how you build these companies.</p>
</details>

我们从 Panera 的技术部门带走了一些人，负责构建所有那些技术的第三号人物加入了我们，并带来了一个团队。我们有能力真正做好技术。我还有另一个合伙人，他是一位连续创业者，擅长食品、设计和创意。当我们进入一个较小的业务时，他在整合资源方面非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We took out a number of people from Panera's technology function. The number three guy who built all that technology joined us and he brought a team with him. We have the capability of really doing technology. I have an another partner who's a a serial entrepreneur, great at food, great at design, great with ideas. We get into a smaller business. I mean, he's superb in helping bring it all together.</p>
</details>

所以，我们在 Act III 的模式是，首先押注一个品类，然后有能力进入并帮助他们建立该品类的主导者。所以在 Cava，第一年我们就能够提供大量所需的技术技能，在很多方面提供帮助，比如在引进有效的 CFO 之前，我们提供了支持，并以多种不同方式帮助该业务成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the model for us in act three was one to to bet on on a category and then have the ability to go in and help them build the dominant player in that category. And so at Cava, we were able to that that first year to really provide a lot of technology skills that were needed, help out in in many ways as there wasn't a an effective CFO till we brought that in and to actually help in in multiple different ways to help that business grow.</p>
</details>

那是非常艰难的一年。我记得我们的 CEO Brett，我们过去每隔一周就一起吃早餐。有一次在华盛顿市中心吃完早餐回来的路上，他若有所思地看着我说：“Ron，我真希望我们还只有那 50 家店，而不是我们买下的这 300 家。”我看着他，说：“Brett，你知道，我们已经没有那个选择了。我们需要做的是在你周围建立能承载重任的人员和组织，来抓住这个机会。但如果我们能成功，那将势不可挡，我们将在一个强大的品类中建立一家了不起的公司。”最终，Cava 成为了过去五年餐饮业中可能是最好的 IPO。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was a very tough year. I can remember Brett, our CEO, we used to go to breakfast every other week, walking back from breakfast in downtown DC, and he looked at me wistfully and said, "Ron, I just wish we still had just our 50 stores, not these 300 that we bought." And I looked at him and I go, "Brett, you know, we don't have that choice anymore. What we need to build is load-bearing people and organization around you that can take on this opportunity. But if we can pull this off, Katie bar the door, we're going to build an amazing company in a powerful category. And ultimately, Cava has been probably the the single best IPO in the last half decade in the restaurant industry.</p>
</details>

### 上市的艺术：长期主义者的游戏

让我们回到 Au Bon Pain 的 IPO。我记得你谈到过它如何改变了一切，你没有预料到会有这么多新的利益相关者或人在你背后指手画脚，以及随之而来的短期主义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's go back to the Au Bon Pain IPO just for a second because I remember you talking about how it changed everything for you and you didn't anticipate having all these new constituents or people breathing down your neck and the the short termism that sort of comes with some partners I guess some capital partners.</p>
</details>

我会换一种说法。我写过一本书叫《知道什么才重要》（Know What Matters），其中有一章是关于 IPO 的。Shane，我要提醒你，我曾为几十个准备上市的人提供过咨询。我通常会告诉他们，90% 的上市企业家最终都会后悔，因为它是一个非常不同的事业。但对我来说，它非常棒。我做过好几次，它在很多方面给我的生活带来了巨大的福祉，但同时也伴随着困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say differently. I did a book called Know It Matters and I did a chapter on the IPO. I'll warn you, Shane. I've counseled dozens of people on going public who are going public. And I typically start by telling people 90% of the entrepreneurs that go public live to regret it because it's a very different enterprise. Now, for me, it was phenomenal. I've done it multiple times and you know, it's created great blessings in my life in many ways, but there are also difficulties that go with it.</p>
</details>

我记得我们上市那天，我当时的合伙人 Lu King 欣喜若狂。我让他停下我们坐的豪华轿车，我下车穿过纽约的中央公园，开始思考我对所有这些投资了数千万、数亿美元在这家公司的人所感到的责任。现实是，当你经营一家企业时，你对相信你的人负有责任，你想要回报他们。我想要回报那些买入股票的人，而不是那些做空股票的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I can remember the day we went public, my partner at that time, Lu King, was was on cloud nine and um I had him stop the the car we were in uh the limousine and I got out and I walked through Central Park down here in New York and I started thinking to myself just the sense of responsibility I felt to all of these folks that were investing tens of hundreds of millions of dollars in this company. And the reality is when you're running an enterprise, you have a responsibility. The people that believe in you and you want to deliver. I want to deliver for the people who are buying the stock, not the ones that are shorting the stock.</p>
</details>

投资者形形色色，他们来自不同的背景。有些人和我们一起，为了长期目标而建设。另一些人则为了短期利益而交易股票。你面临着所有这些压力，而且这一切都在一个非常公开的方式下进行。你保护公司内部事务和发展的能力非常有限，你需要为黄金时段做好准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There were any number of those investors. They all came from very different places. Some were with us and building something for the long term. Others were were trading the stock for the short term. And you had all of these pressures. And it all played out in a very public way. you had very limited ability to protect whatever was going on in your company and develop it and you needed to be ready for prime time.</p>
</details>

我给你讲个故事。当我们决定让 Cava 上市时，我想人们会认为这是一次非常成功的 IPO。今天，它的股价是 IPO 价格的三倍半，被认为非常成功。我们做了什么？在上市前的一年半里，我们帮助 Brett 和团队为 IPO 做准备。我们在公司内部模拟季度财报电话会议，邀请我们的投资者参加。他们必须发布新闻稿，回答问题。我们非常努力地帮助他们打磨叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I I'll I'll tell you a story. When when we decided to take Cava public, I think people would consider it a very successful IPO. Today, three and a half times from the IPO price, but considered very successful. What did we do? We helped Brett and the team get ready for an IPO for a year and a half before we went public. We did quarterly earnings calls in the company simulated with our investors. You know, they had to do press releases. They had to take questions. We we we worked with great diligence in getting their narrative down.</p>
</details>

这样，当他们走向市场时，他们知道自己在卖什么，他们在向华尔街兜售参与地中海品类主导者成长的可能性。我认为我们为这家公司上市做了非常充分的准备。我们没有让投资银行家控制发行。我们自己控制。我们引进了像 T. Rowe Price 这样的基石投资者，我与他们有长期的合作关系，并帮助他们赚了数十亿美元。我们引进了资本集团（Capital Group），我也曾帮助他们赚了数十亿美元。我们让他们作为早期投资者进入。我们限制了发行量。我们中没有人在 IPO 时出售股票。这对任何现有投资者或像我这样的大股东来说，都不是一个套现的机会，而是一个支持和推动公司的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that when they went out they knew what they were selling and they were selling to the street the possibility of participating in the growth of what would be the the dominant player in Mediterranean. I think we really prepared this company uh when we actually went to market. We didn't let the investment bankers control the distribution. We did. We brought in cornerstone investors like T. Rowe Price who I had a long-standing relationship with and make had helped make billions of dollars for them. We brought in um Capital Group which again I had been part of helping make billions of dollars for them. We brought them in as early investors. We limited the distribution. None of us were selling stock on the IPO. This wasn't an opportunity for any of the existing investors or the or the largest ones like me to get money out. It was an opportunity to support and fuel the company.</p>
</details>

我们基本上只允许投资银行家分销 9% 的股份，这些股份主要流向他们的客户和对冲基金。我们保护了 91% 的发行股份，确保它们落入正确的人手中。我认为我们以长远的眼光看待 IPO，很好地服务了这家公司。对我来说，IPO 有点像一场婚礼庆典，它是婚姻的开始，而不是结束。你知道，结过婚的我，会告诉你，在婚礼那天你真的要好好思考一下。为了拥有一场成功的婚礼，你需要做什么？如果你不这样做，那场庆典就会被遗忘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And essentially, we only allowed the investment banker 9% of the shares in distribution, which essentially went to their clients and the hedge funds. We protected 91% of it of that distribution so that it ended up in the right hands. And I think that we serve that company very well. Um, in taking a long-term view of the IPO, the end was to me, an IPO is a little like a wedding celebration. It's the beginning of the marriage. It's not the end. And, you know, having been married, I I would say to you, you want to really contemplate that on your on your wedding day. What What is it you're going to have to do to have a successful wedding? and um that celebration will will will fall by the wayside. Um if you don't.</p>

### 核心原则：更优竞争替代方案

你现在对控制权的看法是否因所有这些经历而有所不同？我会换一种方式回答。你问我是否考虑控制权。看，我学到的一个教训是相信自己。在我成长和职业生涯发展的过程中，如果你聪明，你总会说，那个人在这件事或那件事上给我施压，我错过了什么？我该怎么做？当我回首往事时，我学到的一个教训是相信自己，相信我真的知道自己在做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think about control differently now with all your experiences? I'd answer it differently. You asked me if I think about control. Look it one of the lessons I've learned is to believe in yourself. When I was growing up and coming of age professionally, if you're smart, you're always going to say that guy's leaning on me about this or that. What am I not getting? What should I do? And one of the lessons I learned as I look back is to trust myself that I actually know what I'm doing.</p>
</details>

我必须相信它，必须有信念去走完漫长的征途，必须有信念去经历转型的痛苦。对我来说，一个非常有趣的回顾性教训是真正地相信自己。这导致了一个决定，通常当我们喜欢一家公司时，我们希望处于控股地位。我的意思是，我们愿意用自己的钱去赌，我们愿意赌自己。我和 Act III 的合伙人们，不希望受到有不同想法的人的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I have to believe in it and I have to have the faith to get through the long march. I have to have the faith to go through the pain of transformation. One of the really interesting retrospective lessons for me is to actually trust myself. And that has led to um to a a decision that generally when we we we like to be in a control situation in a company. By that I mean that we're willing to bet our own money. We're willing to bet on ourselves. Myself and the act three partners, but we don't want to be at the effect of somebody else who has a different idea.</p>
</details>

坦白说，当你有投资伙伴时，我能想到的最好比喻是，这有点像和某人生孩子。你拿了他们的钱，他们就拥有合法的权利。如果你是我这样的人，你会想要倾听并做出回应。所以我通常喜欢处于控股地位，因为它允许我们采取长期的方法，做那些短期内不会带来利润，但实际上能建立一个更好公司的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and straight up when you have investment partners, the best way I can I can express it to you, it's a little like having a baby with someone. You take their money. You know, they have they they have legitimate rights. And if you're the kind of person I am, you want to listen and you want to be responsive. And so I like generally being in a control position because it allows us to take a long-term approach to do the things that that don't drive profitability in the short term. but actually build a far better company.</p>
</details>

这里有一个我们还没讨论过的原则。我所有关于商业的信念都始于三个词：**更优竞争替代方案**（Better Competitive Alternative）。世界不需要另一家企业，当然也不需要另一家餐厅。我们所做的一切的全部目标，就是为某个目标客户建立一个他们能找到的最好选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, there's there's one principle here that we haven't talked about. And then I want to talk about act three with you. Everything I believe in about business starts with three words, better competitive alternative. The the world doesn't need another business. It certainly doesn't need another restaurant. The whole objective of everything we do is to build something that for some target customer, this is the best alternative they can find.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这听起来像是花哨的 MBA 术语，但其实不是。它的意思就是，你的目标消费者会走过你所有的竞争对手，所有做类似事情的人，然后选择来你这里，因为你比任何人都做得好。如果你能做到这一点，你就能赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I mean by that, it sounds like fancy MBA talk. It isn't. All it means is that your target consumer is going to walk past all of your competitors, all the people doing something similar to you, and choose to come to you because you do it better than anybody else. If you're able to do that, you can win.</p>
</details>

我讲个故事。几年前我在拉斯维加斯演讲，晚上 11:30 我穿过赌场，看到人们在往老虎机里投筹码。我心想，Ron，我唯一会在晚上 11 点出现在赌场的情况，就是我拥有这家赌场，并且有庄家优势。这和我思考商业的方式完全一样。如果我没有一个更优的竞争替代方案，如果我没有庄家优势，这就是一门丑陋的生意，我不想参与。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I I I I tell it by way of a story. I was in um Vegas speaking I don't know a couple of years ago and I walk through the casino at 11:30 and I see folks dumping chips into these slot machines and I think to myself, Ron, the only way I'd ever be in a casino at 11 p.m. is if I own the casino and had the house advantage. It's the same exact thing for me when I think about business. If I don't have a better competitive alternative, if I don't have the house advantage, this is an ugly business and I don't want to be in it.</p>
</details>

我逐渐明白，并且想确保你的听众能清楚地听到的是，比任何事情都重要的是，真正拥有一个概念、一个载体、一个业务，在你的迷你市场里——无论是一英里范围内的实体市场，还是全国范围的房地产市场——你是最好的选择。当你拥有了这一点，你才有可能成长和建立规模化的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What I've come to know and what I'm trying to to make sure your listeners hear loud and clear is that what matters more than anything else is genuinely having a concept, a vehicle, a business that in whatever your mini market is, the physical one mile or the nation if it's real estate, whatever it might be, that you're the best alternative. When you have that, then you have the possibility of growing and building something. A scale.</p>

### 概念精髓与“发现”与“交付”的博弈

这就是你试图通过“概念精髓”（Concept Essence）文件来明确的东西吗？完全正确。“概念精髓”是我们创办每一家企业，以及我们今天所处的每一家企业的起点。我们所处的每一家企业都始于一份“概念精髓”文件。什么是“概念精髓”文件？它本质上是一部区域剧院的剧本。

这样想：如果你在经营一个多单元业务，我其实是在运营数千场每天上演 18 小时的区域戏剧。那么，剧本是什么？环境的美学是什么？食物和食物的态度是什么？人性化体现在哪里？人们是怎样的？从消费者的角度来看，当你走进来时，你的体验是怎样的？我们试图深入挖掘，用有意义的词语来写下这个剧本，或者说我们如何竞争的愿景，这成为了一个组织工具。想象一下，在 Panera，我们有 125,000 名员工。如果你不能把它用语言表达出来，你怎么让他们都朝着我们试图创造的目标前进？

<p class="english-text">Think of it this way. If you're in a multi-unit business, I'm running thousands of of of regional theater shows that are performing 18 hours a day. And so, what is that script? What is the aesthetic of the environment? What is the food and the food attitude? Um, what is the humanity? What are the people like? How do you experience it from a consumer's perspective when you walk in? and we try to really go deep and use words that mean something in writing that script or that vision for how we're going to compete and that becomes an organizing tool. I mean just imagine at Panera we had 125,000 people. How do you get them all aligned with what we're trying to create if you can't put it into words?</p>

但你对此非常执着。你花了九个月时间来撰写这份文件，在你开始之前，你对所有细节都痴迷不已。很多人有一种智慧，那就是“快速行动，快速失败”，而你的做法恰恰相反。你花时间，有条不紊，深入细节，观察人们。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But you obsessed over this. So you spent nine months working on this document before you started and you were obsessed about all the details and walk me through that a little bit because a lot of other people there's there's sort of wisdom which is like go fast and fail fast and this is sort of the opposite of that. you took your time, you were methodical, you were in the weeds, you were watching people.</p>
</details>

“快速行动，快速失败”在科技领域是有道理的，因为那里几乎没有固定成本，你可以完全修复。而我所在的行业，我称之为“拥有固定资产的时尚业”。你建一家餐厅，要花一百万、一百五十万、两百万，甚至更多。你不想搞砸，因为修复它非常困难。所以你想要非常清楚你在做什么，先做什么，后做什么，第三步做什么，并确保顺序正确。因此，我更关心的是以一种非常认真的方式把事情做对，理解它，然后采取正确的步骤，而不是急于冲出去抢占市场份额。

<details>

<p class="english-text">but you know, go fast and and fail makes sense in technology where it's very much um there there's no fixed cost and you can repair completely. Um I'm in a business I call it fashion with fixed assets. It you know, you build a restaurant, you're going to spend a million, a million and a half, $2 million, maybe more. You don't want to mess it up because fixing it is really difficult. So you want to get very clear what you're doing. What do you do first, second, third, and make sure you get it in the right order. So I am much more concerned about getting it right in a really serious way and understanding it and then taking the right steps from that than I am about getting out there and getting market share first.</p>
</details>

因为失败的代价太高了。因为失败的代价是巨大的，而且很多时候一旦你失败了，就无法再回来了。记住，我们谈论的是固定资产，是建造餐厅。如果我不明白我在做什么，我就会建错，我就会失败。

<details>

<p class="english-text">because the cost of failure is so high because the cost of failure is extraordinary and often times once you you bounce you can't come back and remember we're talking about fixed assets we're talking about you know building restaurants. If I don't understand what I'm doing, I'm going to build it wrong. I'm going to fail.</p>
</details>

一旦餐厅开始销售下滑，它们有多大几率能扭转局面？很少。这真的很难，因为组织天生不喜欢改变。事实上，我跟你分享一些我写过的东西。我称之为“企业的生命周期”。它始于“发现”（Discovery），终于“交付”（Delivery）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How often do restaurants turn around once they start losing sales? Rarely. It's really hard because organizations by their nature don't like to change. In fact, I I'll share with you something I've I've I've written about. I call it the life cycle of a business. It starts with discovery and ends with delivery.</p>
</details>

这样想：当一个企业刚起步时，要站稳脚跟并取得成功非常困难。概率非常低。你没有资本，没有规模，没有竞争优势。你的成本是前所未有的高。你需要一些真正强大的东西来突破消费者的认知，以应对所有这些不利因素。但有些人做到了，他们发现了一种更好的方式来接触顾客、打动顾客，一种更好的体验，他们成功起步并开始扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And think of it this way. When a business starts out, it's so hard to get off the ground and win. So hard. Probabilities are very low. Um, you have no capital, no scale, um, no competitive advantage. You have the highest cost you're ever going to have. And, and it requires something that really is powerful to break through with the consumer to deal with all those forces working against you. But some people do and people discover a better way to approach the customer that touch the customer, a better experience and they get off the ground and they start to scale and it works and it's doing well and it's getting bigger.</p>
</details>

接着，外部资本进来了，说：“我们能帮你发展得更快。”很快，你就有了一场董事会会议，人们说：“这个业务做得很好，但如果我们引进一些‘交付’型人才，它能做得更好。”“交付”型人才包括财务规划、采购等一系列不同学科的人。事实是，你引进了“交付”型人才，公司确实变得更好了。利润率提高了，业务更有纪律，更紧凑了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Along comes Outside Capital and Outside Capital says, you know, we can help you grow even further. And pretty soon you have a board meeting of people saying, you know, this business is doing great, but but but you know what? It could do even better if we bring in some of these, I'll call them delivery people. Delivery people are, you know, financial planning and purchasing and a range of different disciplines. And the truth of the matter is, you bring in the delivery people, it makes the place better. The margins get better. The business gets more disciplined. It gets tightened.</p>
</details>

但接下来发生的事情是，不是在六个月内，而是在数年甚至半个十年内，“交付”型人才和“发现”型人才发现他们说的不是同一种语言。“发现”的语言是诗歌的语言，是“想象一下，如果我们能做到这个……”的语言。而“交付”的语言是“证明给我看，给我看数字，让我看电子表格，我不相信你”的语言。坦白说，这两种力量相互挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here's what begins to happen. And not over six months, but over years and and half a decade, the delivery people and the discovery people find they're talking different languages. The language of discovery is the language of poetry. It's the language of imagine if if only we could do this. The language of of of discovery, of delivery, is the language of prove it to me. Show me the numbers. Let me see the spreadsheet. I don't believe you. And quite frankly, these these forces challenge each other.</p>
</details>

但是，“交付”因为它确实能增加价值，开始排挤“发现”，因为如果“交付”在施压，“发现”就没有生存空间。随着时间的推移，在很多食品公司里发生的情况是，“发现”被“交付”排挤出去。“交付”变得越来越强大，成为公司的主导力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the language of uh but but delivery because it does add value starts to push out discovery because discovery doesn't have oxygen if if if you got delivery pushing down on it. And over time what happens in so many food companies is that that discovery is pushed out by delivery. delivery gets stronger and stronger and stronger and it becomes the dominant force in the company.</p>
</details>

然后这些公司在 15 或 20 年后醒来，它们已经成为价值数十亿美元的公司，非常擅长交付 5 年前、10 年前、20 年前消费者想要和需要的东西，但在发现明天需要和想要什么方面却非常糟糕。所以，我一直关注的一件事就是保护“发现”。事实上，作为 CEO，我把自己的角色看作是首席发现官和首席创新官，因为由于离心力、规模和体量的本质，你最终会在这些公司里扼杀“发现”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then these companies wake up after 15 or 20 years. They're billion-dollar companies and they're really powerful about delivering what was wanted and needed by the consumer 5 years ago, 10 years ago and 20 and really terrible about discovering what's going to be needed and wanted for tomorrow. And so one of the things that I've always focused on is actually protecting discovery and in fact as a CEO viewing my role as discoverer and chief innovator and chief because that will by the very nature of centrifugal force um and size and scale you will end up decapitating discovery in these companies.</p>

### 企业家的真正代价与成功的定义

经营企业的困难，经营企业的成本，家庭成本，社会成本……当你做任何需要强大投入的事情时，那份投入会占据你，你并不拥有它。我从未拥有过一家企业，是企业拥有我。它在洗澡时与我同在，在度假时与我同在，它一直与我同在。事实上，我一些最好的工作成果是在度假时完成的，那时我并没有有意识地去思考它，但我有能力提炼和理解。

<p class="english-text">the difficulties of running a business, the costs of running a business, the family cost, the social costs, the talk to me about that with Au Bon Pain in particular and Panera and when you're doing anything that's takes powerful commitment that commitment owns you. You don't own it. I I I've never owned a business. The business is on me. It's with me in the shower. It's with me on vacation. Um, it's it's it's it's there with me. And in fact, some of my best work is done when I'm I'm I'm I'm on vacation. I'm not actually thinking about it in a conscious sense. And I have the ability to extract and and understand.</p>

但是，听着，在世界上做任何事，无论是每天早上锻炼，还是维持一段关系，都需要承诺。它需要对长期的承诺，需要责任感。我只想说，我一直致力于这些事业，致力于那些相信我的人，致力于我的团队成员，我的投资者，我想给他们一些有价值的东西。我想建立一些有品质的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but listen, doing anything in the world, whether it's working out every morning, whether it's being in a relationship, requires commitment. And it requires a commitment to the long term and it requires responsibility. I would simply say I've been committed to these businesses. I've been committed to the people that have believed in me. I've been committed to my team members, to my investors, and I want to give them something worthy. I want to I want to build something of quality.</p>
</details>

这其中有非常真实的个人代价。我结过两次婚，这并非我引以为傲的事。我感觉这是一种失败。这是因为我致力于我的事业而导致的失败吗？我不知道。但我有时会思考这个问题。人生最大的谬误就是你可以拥有一切。生活中只有选择，你希望用清醒的头脑和开放的眼光来做选择，明确你珍视什么，你尊重什么，然后围绕它来构建你的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's a very real personal price. I've been married twice. Um it's not something I'm proud of. I feel like uh it it it it's a failure. Is that a failure because I was committed to my business? I don't know. But I but I sometimes I think about that. The biggest fallacy of life is that you can have everything and that all there are are choices and that you you want to make your choices with a clear head and and your open eyes as to what you value, what you respect and then you want to build your life around that.</p>
</details>

就像我试图围绕我们的“概念精髓”和期望来建立一个企业一样，我试图围绕我将要尊重的东西来构建我的人生。这就是为什么我真的会定期思考，为了我自己的自尊，在我与身体的关系、与家人和配偶的关系、与朋友的关系、与工作的关系中，我需要做什么？做好这些意味着什么？最终，还有我与自己灵性和个人诚信的关系。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Just as I try to build a business around what it is we try to what kinds of essence and what we expect, I try to build my life around what is it I'm going to respect. And that's why I really try to think through on a regular basis what is it I need to do um for my own self-respect in the context of my relationship with my my body my relationship with my family and and and my my my spouse um my friends um my relationship with my work and what does it mean to do that well and ultimately a relationship with my own spirituality and my own um personal integrity.</p>
</details>

你把所有这些整合起来，试图建立一个生活，同时要明白，没有所谓的平衡，你不可能拥有一切。你必须做出选择，有得有失，你尽力做到最好。我只是鼓励你的听众清楚地知道他们想要什么，他们将要尊重什么。你不想做的是，有一天醒来说：“我真希望我当初……”然后错过了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You take all of that and you try to put that together and you try to build a life understanding there is no balance. You can't have it all. You've got to you make choices and their trade-offs and you try to do that as well as you can. I just encourage your listeners to be clear what it is that they want and what it is that they're going to respect. What you don't want to do is wake up one day and say, "I wish I had and miss it."</p>

你认为专注在你的成功中有多重要？我非常专注。你知道，我工作很努力，一直都是。我热爱它，享受它。我喜欢我们解决问题的时候。我愿意认为我保护了我周围的人，并且我愿意付出代价。我的意思是，我愿意做那些艰苦的工作。大多数人不愿意付出那个代价，他们不明白，如果你不建立一个更好的替代方案，你就不会得到副产品，而那需要艰苦的工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">How important do you think that focus was in your success? I'm pretty focused. And you know, I work hard. I always have. I love it. I enjoy it. I love when we figure things out. I I like to think that I protected the people around me and that I'm but I I like to think I'm willing to pay the price. And by that I mean I'm willing to do what it takes to do the hard work. Most people aren't willing to pay that price and they don't understand you're not going to get the byproduct if you don't if you don't build something that's a better alternative and that's hard work.</p>
</details>

对我来说，成功是什么？是自尊。讽刺的是，对我来说，成功是看着自己，知道我已经尽我所能地构建了最好的生活。无论是我作为父亲的角色，我与孩子们的关系，还是作为配偶的角色，在人际关系中，无论是我作为老板的类型，以及我在人们生活中带来的改变。对我来说非常重要的是，我触动了遍布这个国家和世界许多地方的人们的生活。有客人走上前来对我说：“谢谢你，谢谢你所做的一切。我喜欢待在你的地方。”并且知道，我成为了我能成为的最好的自己。

<p class="english-text">What is success for you? Self-respect. Ironically to me success is looking at myself and knowing I have built the best life that I know how to build.

Um very important to me the lives I I've I've touched all over this country and many parts of this world. Guests who've come up to me and said, "Thank you, you know, for what you did.

人们总是问我：“你的遗产是什么？”昨天在托尼·罗宾斯（Tony Robbins）的活动上，有人问我：“你希望你的遗产是什么？”我思考了一下，意识到，没有所谓的遗产。你知道，事情会继续，会改变。我不认为 50 年后人们还会谈论我。我认为我的遗产，坦白说，最重要的是我的孩子们，以及我向他们展示的、在他们的生活、心灵和灵魂中延续下去的东西。这些才是重要的事。当我回顾我在这地球上的 71 年，我感到非常幸运，有机会做我热爱的工作，去爱，去触动人们。我希望在某种小小的程度上，我所做的一切都配得上所有这些祝福。

Or somebody said to me yesterday at this Tony Robbins event, you know, "What do you want your legacy to be?" And I I think about it and I realize there is no legacy. You know, you know, things go on, they change. I don't think 50 years from now people will be talking about me. I I I think what my legacy is, frankly, what matters most is my kids and the things I show them that live on in their lives and and in their hearts and in their their souls and in their kids. And those are the kinds of things that matter. And as I look back at this my 71 years on this earth, uh I just feel so blessed to have had the chance to do work that I've loved, to love, um to touch people, and I hope in some small way I've done this in a way that is worthy of all those blessings.</p>
