### 美联储主席提名与市场影响

**Tracy**: 大家好，欢迎收听《奇思妙想》播客。我是**特雷西·阿洛韦**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Joe**: 我是**乔·魏森塔尔**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: And I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy**: 乔，上周**特朗普**提名了**凯文·沃什**担任美联储主席。我们节目一直在讨论这件事。显然，这会带来巨大的市场影响，但我开始觉得，这背后的社会学问题和方面更有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So Joe, Trump nominated Kevin Worsh to be Fed Chair last week. We've been talking about it on the show. Obviously, this has big market implications, but I'm starting to think that the sociological questions and aspects of this are more interesting.

</details>

**Joe**: 我对那些支持或反对这个提名的人感到非常好奇。这不像我记忆中任何其他被提名人，你会看到一些相当主流甚至自由派的人，比如**贾森·弗曼**或**吉塔·戈皮纳特**，说这是一个很棒的选择；然后你又看到**保罗·克鲁格曼**和**尼尔·达**说这是一个糟糕的选择。它的分歧方式是我之前没有预料到的，不像我记忆中**特朗普**的任何其他提名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I'm so intrigued by the constellation of people who have come out either in support or opposition of this name. It is not like any other nominee that I can recall where you have fairly mainstream, even liberal names like Jason Ferman or Gita Goponath saying there's a great pick, and then you have Paul Krugman and Neil Da saying this is a terrible pick and so forth. It cuts in ways that I would not have necessarily anticipated, not like any other Trump pick that I recall.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的，分歧很大，感觉**沃什**自己的想法内部也有分歧。对吧？因为这个人曾说过要彻底改革**美联储**，甚至“打破一些脑袋”，我想这是我们之前提到过的一句直接引语。他还发表过一篇题为《中央银行独立颂》的演讲。但与此同时，他如何以及为何突然从一个通胀鹰派转变为一个主张低利率的人，这存在一个很大的问号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah, it is very split and it feels like there's a split within Worsh's own thinking as well. Right? Because here we have a guy who has talked about wanting to overhaul the Fed, and even break some heads, I think was a direct quote that we've mentioned before. He has given a speech that is literally titled "An Ode to Independence at the Central Bank." But at the same time, there's a big question mark about how and why he has suddenly seemingly gone from an inflation hawk to someone who's advocating for low rates.

</details>

**Joe**: 完全正确。当然，我认为，坦率地说，任何来自本届政府的被提名人，在某种程度上都会存在疑问，因为**特朗普**显然对**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**非常不满，尽管他自己提名了鲍威尔。很明显，他现在想要一个“低利率”的人。他在提名后说：“他没有做出太多承诺，但我认为他会是一个低利率的人。”然后几天后他又开玩笑说，他会起诉，如果**沃什**不降息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Totally. And of course, I think, just to be blunt, this would have been something that any nominee from this administration, to some extent, there would have been question marks around because obviously Trump has been very critical of Jerome Powell, despite the fact that he nominated him himself, and it's clear that he wants a low rates now kind of guy in there. He said after the nomination, "He didn't make many promises, but I think he's going to be a low rates guy." And then he joked a couple of days later that he was going to sue about to bring that up, and that was a, he was joking. He said he was going to sue if War...

</details>

**Tracy**: 玩笑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Joke.

</details>

**Joe**: 玩笑，打引号的玩笑，你不知道，但这确实是件大事。所以问题是，一位即将上任的美联储主席，如果他通过参议院（这并非板上钉钉），他能在多大程度上确立他长期以来所说的**美联储**独立性，同时又不立即激怒提名他的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Joke, air quotes, you don't know it, but this has been the big thing. So the question is the degree to which an incoming Fed chair, if he passes the Senate, which isn't guaranteed, but if he passes the Senate, can establish his commitment to what he's long talked about, which is Fed independence, while also not immediately angering the guy who nominated him.

</details>

**Tracy**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Exactly.

</details>

**Joe**: 没错。所以，我们需要讨论所有这些，深入了解**美联储**理事会的文化、政治提名以及市场影响。我们确实请到了最完美的嘉宾。我们将与**理查德·克拉里达**对话。他当然是**PIMCO**的全球经济顾问，**哥伦比亚大学**经济学教授，最重要的是，就本次对话而言，他曾是**联邦储备委员会**的副主席。所以，他真是最完美的嘉宾。**里奇**，感谢您再次来到节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: To the extent that that matters. Exactly right. So, we need to talk about all of this, get a little bit more color on, I guess, Fed board culture, and political nominations as well, and market implications, of course. And we really do have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Richard Clarida. He is, of course, global economic adviser at PIMCO, a professor of economics at Columbia, and most importantly for the purpose of this particular conversation, he's a former vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board. So honestly, the perfect guest. Rich, thanks for coming back on the show.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 谢谢。期待我们的讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Thank you. Looking forward to our discussion.

</details>

**Tracy**: 那么，我先从一个非常明显的问题开始，然后我们再深入探讨。上周，当**沃什**被**特朗普**选中的消息传出时，您脑海中闪过的第一个念头是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So why don't I just start with the very obvious question and we can dig in from there. But last week when the news broke about Worsh being selected by Trump, what was the first thought that went through your head?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我认为这是一个非常明智的选择。它在重要的维度上是合理的。特别是，它很重要，因为我认为，根据他的背景和他最近的著作，**沃什**将与**财政部**的**斯科特·贝桑特**合作得非常好。我们稍后会谈到**美联储**的独立性，但实际上，**美联储**与**财政部**良好合作是很重要的，因此它在很多维度上都是合理的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I think it's a very sensible choice. It makes sense along important dimensions. In particular, it's important because I think based upon background and what he's been writing recently that wars will work very well with Scott Bessant at the Treasury. There is Fed independence that we'll get into, but it's important as a practical matter that the Fed work well with the Treasury and so it makes sense along a lot of dimensions.

</details>

### 美联储与财政部的合作

**Tracy**: 实际上，我们现在就来谈谈这个，因为我确实觉得这很有趣。请多谈谈与**财政部**的合作。有些人可能会说，这不是**美联储**的职责。事实上，我想说，**凯文·沃什**早在**大金融危机**刚结束的时期就曾谈到，例如，支持财政政策、促成更大赤字不是**美联储**的职责，他认为**量化宽松**（**QE**）就是促成这些的。但从您的角度来看，请告诉我们**美联储**主席和**财政部长**之间积极的关系是怎样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Actually, let's just get into that because I do find that to be very interesting. Say more about working with the Treasury. You know, some people would say that is not the Fed's job. In fact, I would say, you know, Kevin Worsh going back to the immediate post great financial crisis era had talked about how, for example, it's not the Fed's job to backs stop fiscal policy. It's not the Fed's job to enable larger deficits, which he, I believe, saw QE as enabling. But from your perspective, talk to us about what a positive relationship between the Fed chair and the Treasury Secretary looks like.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 是的，谢谢您让我补充一些细节。因为在某些维度和领域，**美联储**受**财政部**主导确实是个非常糟糕的主意。但在几个维度上，协作的工作关系很重要，我将列举几个。首先，**美联储**自成立以来就是政府的财政代理人。它有责任确保国债市场有足够的流动性，并正常运作。这是这项工作的一个重要组成部分，而且一直如此。它也很重要，因为**美联储**在银行监管中扮演着重要角色，但并非垄断角色。**财政部**内部的货币监理署也负有监管责任，**联邦存款保险公司**（**FDIC**）也是如此。因此，在银行监管方面，必然需要一定程度的协调。所以，我真的会强调这两个领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Yeah, thank you for letting me add some color to that because there are dimensions and domains where it would actually be a very bad idea for the Fed to be dominated by the Treasury. But along several dimensions, a collaborative working relationship is important and I'll name several. First is the Fed going back to its founding is the fiscal agent of the government. It has a responsibility to make sure that the treasury market has adequate liquidity that it functions properly. And so that's an important element of the job and always has been. It's also important because the Fed has an important role in bank regulation but not a monopoly role. The controller of the currency which is within Treasury also has a regulation responsibility as FDIC. So as a matter of necessity on bank regulation there needs to be a degree of coordination and so I would really highlight those two areas.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我一开始提到我对**美联储**理事会的内部运作很感兴趣。从您的角度来看，**美联储**和**财政部**之间的沟通是如何进行的？我有点想象，像**WhatsApp**或**Signal**群聊那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So I mentioned at the beginning that I'm kind of interested in the inner functioning of the Fed board. From your perspective, how does communication between the Fed and the Treasury actually happen? I'm sort of envisioning like I don't know a WhatsApp or signal group chat.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 有一个传统，虽然没有写入法律，但**财政部长**和**美联储**主席会定期会面，通常是共进早餐。所以在我任职期间，主要的联系点是双边会谈，在我任职时是**杰伊·鲍威尔**和**史蒂文·努钦**，后来是**珍妮特·耶伦**担任**财政部长**。所以这是非正式的。通常没有工作人员在场。此外，还有**金融稳定监督委员会**，这是**多德-弗兰克法案**的产物，根据法律规定由**财政部长**担任主席，**美联储**以及其他机构也参与其中。第三，正如我提到的，任何涉及银行监管的事情通常都会涉及高级官员，甚至是负责监管的副主席级别的互动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: There is a tradition, it's not in statute, there is a tradition that the Treasury Secretary and the Fed chair meet on a regular basis, oftentimes over breakfast. And so during my time, that was the primary point of contact was bilateral between when I was there Jay Pal and Steven Minutuchin and then when Janet Yellen became Treasury Secretary. So that's informal. There are typically not staff in the room for that. There's also the financial stability oversight council which was a creation in DoddFrank which by statute is chaired by the treasury secretary and then the there fed among other agencies also participates in that process. And then thirdly as I mentioned anything involving a bank regulation is typically going to involve if the senior or even the vice chair for supervision level interaction on bank regulation.

</details>

### 对凯文·沃什的质疑

**Tracy**: 让我们来谈谈对**凯文·沃什**的一些批评或疑问。这有几个不同的方面。首先，当然，有一种看法认为他长期以来一直是通胀鹰派，但过去12到18个月左右，他突然听起来更像鸽派了。抛开这一点不谈，一些批评很早就开始了，包括他对**大金融危机**的判断。他更关心通胀，甚至在2008年秋季，也就是危机爆发前夕，他更关心通胀而不是就业。他还似乎对通胀在最糟糕时期过后很快到来感到非常焦虑。但是，当您思考他的资历以及我们能从他身上期待什么时，回到那个时代，我们应该在多大程度上因此而对他有所保留呢？无论是他判断失误，还是他当时至少与主流观点相去甚远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: You know, let's get into some of the, I guess, criticisms or perhaps questions about Kevin Worsh. And there's a few different dimensions. One is, of course, there's perception that he's long been an inflation hawk and suddenly he's sounded more dovish over the last, you know, 12, 18 months or whatever. Setting that aside though, you know, some of the criticisms start early on, including his judgment around the great financial crisis. Concerned more about inflation, you know, even up into fall 2008 than employment right on the eve of collapse. Also seemed to get very anxious about inflation soon coming out of the worst of it, etc. But like when you think about okay like his qualifications and what we can expect from him, how much like when you go back to that era, how much should we hold that against him perhaps? Either that he was off the mark or that he was at least very far out of consensus at the time.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 嗯，我认为你必须看全局。**凯文**也深度参与了**本·伯南克**、**蒂姆·盖特纳**和**达德利**应对**全球金融危机**的危机响应，这场危机持续了12到18个月。我认为，根据大多数说法，以及我的判断，他在“战争迷雾”中确实增加了很大的价值。通胀，正如我自己学到的，尤其是在危机和异常大的冲击时期，通胀预测可能具有挑战性。所以我认为我不应该因为那个特定事件而对他有所保留。我认为这确实公平地描述了我们大多数人对**凯文**在那个时期以及过去15年来的看法，他一直是**伯南克**任期后半段、**耶伦**和**鲍威尔**领导下的**美联储**的相当一致的批评者，而且批评通常来自鹰派方向。当然，在那个事件中，他对**美联储**的批评，在某些引语中，也表明了这种鹰派倾向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Well, I think you have to look at the entire picture and Kevin was also very involved with Ben and Tim Gner and Dudley and the crisis response to the global financial crisis which really played out over a period of 12 to 18 months and I think by most accounts in my judgment that was a you he actually added a lot of value in in the fog of war. Inflation as I myself learned especially in periods of crisis and unusual large shocks inflation forecasting can be can be challenging. So I don't think I would hold that particular episode against him. I think it does fairly characterize the way that most of us think about Kevin throughout during that period and really the last 15 years is he has been a pretty consistent critic of the Fed under the second half of Bernani and then Yellen and Pal and typically the criticism has come from the hawkish direction and certainly in that episode his his criticism of the Fed was that in some certain quotes would indicate that hawkish inclination as Well, maybe just I can follow up because in your earlier comment, you also mentioned his his recent advocacy for for lower rates.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 也许我可以接着说，因为您早些时候的评论中也提到了他最近主张降低利率。现在，重要的是，这发生在一个委员会的背景下，在**鲍威尔**的领导下，从2024年9月开始，该委员会已经开始降息。事实上，当我早些时候参加您的节目，我们讨论了**鲍威尔**领导下的首次降息后，我提到了我一段时间以来一直在说的，**美联储**正在实施我称之为“2点几的通胀目标”的政策，也就是说，他们不喜欢通胀以3、4、5、6或7开头。但如果通胀降到2点几，他们就可以开始谈论并考虑降息，就像他们在**鲍威尔**领导下以及在去年12月的**美联储**会议上所做的那样。所以，就在大约六周前，**美联储**通过那些非常不完美的点阵图表明，现有委员会的大多数成员（**凯文**将继承这个委员会）认为，鉴于目前的情况，今年至少再降息一次是合适的。所以，是的，**凯文**在他的公开评论中支持降息。我不知道他私下对总统说了什么，但我怀疑他公开和私下说的会有不同。但这发生在一个委员会的背景下，其中至少大多数人认为，今年至少降息一次是合适的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Well, maybe just I can follow up because in your earlier comment, you also mentioned his his recent advocacy for for lower rates. Now, it's important this is in the context of a committee that under Pal's leadership beginning in September of 2024 already began to cut rates. In fact, when I did your show earlier and we were talking about that right after I think the initial rate cuts under under PAL, I made reference to what I've been calling for some time now the Fed is is running what I call the quote 2 point something inflation target which was they don't like it to start with a three, four, five, six or seven. But if inflation gets down to 2 point something, they can start to talk and think about rate cuts as they did under under PAL and in importantly at the December Fed meeting. So just about six weeks ago, the Fed indicated through those very imperfect dot plots that a majority of the committee of of that existing committee which Kevin will inherit felt that at least one more rate cut this year given the circumstances would be appropriate. So yes, Kevin has come out in favor of rate cuts in his public comments. Don't know what he said privately to the president, but I doubt that they differed what he said publicly. But that's in the context of a committee that at least a majority of whom think that in this year it'll be appropriate to cut at least once.

</details>

### 美联储主席的权力与运作

**Joe**: 我会继续假装自己是个人类学家，问一堆文化问题，但当你在货币政策会议上时，**美联储**主席的实际角色是什么？比如说，如果**沃什**有一些异于常人的观点，我不知道，他优先考虑就业而不是物价，或者其他什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I'm just going to keep pretending to be an anthropologist and ask a bunch of cultural questions, but what actually is the role of Fed chair when you're in a monetary policy meeting? So, you know, let's say that Worish has some sort of outlier opinion. I don't know, he's prioritizing employment versus prices or whatever.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。他能说服桌上的所有人，所有有投票权的成员，真正改变他们的想法吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. Can he convince everyone at the table, all the voting members to actually change their minds?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: **特雷西**，这是一个很好的问题，因为我喜欢强调的一点是，至少在我职业生涯中，可以追溯到**保罗·沃尔克**时代，我们倾向于将**美联储**称为“**沃尔克美联储**”、“**格林斯潘美联储**”、“**鲍威尔美联储**”、“**耶伦美联储**”、“**伯南克美联储**”。这是恰当的，因为在这个时代，**美联储**主席们都很有说服力，他们通常能如愿以偿。但重要的是，**美联储**作为一个机构，在1930年代由国会专门设计，任何实质性的货币政策决定，无论是提高还是降低利率，或是买卖国债，都需要由一个由12名成员组成的委员会投赞成票。所以，正如我喜欢说的，我再说一遍，**美联储**主席的权力实际上是说服力，因为归根结底，他或她只有一票。现在人们常说，**里奇**，这很傻，因为**美联储**主席很少被否决，这是事实。在**沃尔克**任期内发生过一两次，早在1940年代也发生过。所以，是的，从经验上看，主席似乎总是能如愿以偿，但请记住，**美联储**主席知道委员会的倾向，而且在某些情况下，他们自己可能会决定不站在某个特定投票的失败一方，而是试图随着时间的推移说服委员会朝着他们的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Tracy, it's a great question because a point that I like to make, at least in my professional time, which goes back to Paul Vulkar, we tend to talk about the Fed is the Vulkar Fed, the Greenspan Fed, Pal Yellen, Bernani Fed. And that's appropriate because in this era, Fed shares have been persuasive and they and they've usually got their their their way. But importantly, the Fed as an institution was specifically designed by the Congress in the 1930s in such a way that any material monetary policy decision, do they raise or lower interest rates or do they buy or sell treasuries, requires an affirmative vote of a committee comprised of 12 members. And so as I as I've liked to say and I'll say it again, really the power of the Fed chair is the power of persuasion because at the end of the day he or she only has one vote. Now it's often argued that well Rich that's silly because rarely do Fed chairs get outvoted and that that's true. It happened once or twice under Vulkar. It happened way back in the 1940s. And so yes, empirically it may appear as though chairs always get their way, but but remember Fed chairs know where the committee is leaning and often times or certain circumstances they may themselves decide not to be on the losing end of a particular vote but to try to persuade the committee over time to move in their direction.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 现在，有一件事我无法真正谈论**格林斯潘美联储**，但从**伯南克**开始，在**耶伦**领导下继续，当然还有**杰伊·鲍威尔**，**联邦公开市场委员会**（**FOMC**）会议前有很多预先沟通。事实上，在我任职期间，**鲍威尔**会在每次会议前与另外18个人进行单独的双边讨论，不仅仅是投票成员，还有7位当年没有投票权的储备银行行长。所以**鲍威尔**会在每次会议前进行18次单独的电话或面对面会谈。例如，我认为这在**格林斯潘**任期内不是惯例。所以，**美联储**主席真正做的一部分工作是了解委员会中每个人的想法，但主席确实拥有的一个重要权力是设定会议议程，而且大部分工作人员简报是由理事会工作人员准备的，有时会征求储备银行行长的意见，而理事会工作人员向主席汇报。因此，会议议程以及通常关于对讨论有用的分析细节，将是主席会提出意见的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Now one thing I can't really speak to the Greenspan Fed but beginning under Bernani and continuing under Yelen and certainly with Jay Pal there is a lot of premeating FOMC meeting communication and indeed Pal during my time there would have individual bilateral discussions with the other 18 people not just the voters but if you know there are 12 voters and another seven Reserve Bank presidents who don't vote in a particular year so Pal would have 18 individual phone calls or face-toface meetings before every meeting. I don't think that was the practice under Greenspan, for example. And so part of really what a Fed chair does is to get a sense of where individuals on the committee are, but really an important power that the chair does have is the chair sets the agenda for the meeting and the staff briefings for the most part are prepared by the board staff, sometimes with input from the reserve bank presidents and the board staff reports to the chair. And so the agenda for the meeting and often times details about the sort of analysis that would be useful for the discussion will be something that the chair will have a view on.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 现在，您提到了趣闻轶事，在我任职期间，由于我拥有货币经济学背景，**鲍威尔**主席确实要求我在他本人和工作人员之间，特别是在预测和货币事务小组之间，扮演一个相当亲力亲为的角色，但最终我的角色实际上是为了他想要做的事情，为了成功召开会议而服务。我最后要说的是，您让我有点激动了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Now during you you asked for anecdotes you know during during my time because of my background in in monetary economics chair pal J pal did ask me to take a pretty hands-on role in interfacing between himself and the staff in particular the forecasting and the monetary affairs groups but ultimately my role was really in service to what he wanted to do to produce a successful meeting. The final thing I'll say, you got you got me sort of wound up.

</details>

**Tracy**: 都很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: It's all great.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我最后要说的是，我认为这已经公开报道了，但在一次典型的**美联储**会议上，下午2点会发布一项政策声明。这是一个决定，委员会当然会讨论这个决定，但也会讨论其他选项。在一次典型的会议上，除了**美联储**的声明和会议结果的政策行动之外，委员会还会讨论替代方案，实际上是具体的替代方案，方案A、方案B、方案C。会议中可能会就这些替代方案进行相当广泛的来回讨论。所以，即使最终公众看到的是**美联储**决定维持利率不变，并且有两位持异议者，他们是理事和**沃勒**，会议上讨论的作为该声明和该决定的潜在替代方案还有很多。会议中的很多讨论可能都是关于委员会认为下一次会议或未来会议可能合适的方案。事实上，我学到的许多事情之一是，我在任职时曾向自己承诺每天都要尝试学习一些新东西，我通常也做到了。我进入**美联储**之前没有意识到的一件事是，特别是主席和委员会，你真的需要对一年的数据流以及决策需要何时以及如何做出的整体脉络有一个把握。所以，这有点像一个不完美但并非完全糟糕的类比，我们听说过传奇橄榄球教练会预先设计比赛的前50个战术。有时他们会偏离，但他们希望有一个计划，以应对防守方做出某种动作或其他情况。这与我当时在**鲍威尔美联储**时，我们不仅考虑1月份的会议，然后开始考虑3月份的会议，而是真正考虑一年的整体脉络，根据你对数据和许多其他因素的看法。所以这些是主席我认为在整个过程中留下印记的一些具体例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: The final thing I'll say is, and I think this has been publicly reported, but at a typical Fed meeting, there is a policy announcement that comes out at 2 p.m. That's a decision, and the committee, of course, is discussing that decision, but it's discussing other options. And at a typical meeting, in addition to the Fed's statement and the policy action that was the outcome of the meeting, the committee is also discussing alternatives, actually tangible alternatives, alternative A, alternative B, alternative C. And there can be quite extensive back and forth in the meetings about those alternatives. And so even at the end of the day what the public sees is the Fed decided to keep rates on hold and there were two dissents which were governors and Waller a lot more was being discussed at the meeting as potential alternatives to that statement and that decision and a lot of discussion in meetings can be about what the committee thinks might be appropriate for the next meeting or the meeting down the road. Indeed, one of the many things I learned I made a promise to myself when I was in the job to to try to learn something new every day and I usually did and one of the things I didn't appreciate before I got into the to the Fed is especially the the chair and and the palett you you really need to have a sense of the arc of both the year in terms of the data flow you're likely to get and the arc of where decisions need to be made and how they're they're made. And so there's a lot sort of like an imperfect but not completely a bad analogy is we've heard of legendary football coaches who like script the first 50 plays of the game. Now sometimes they move away but they want to have a plan about how they'll react if the defense does a certain thing or the other. And it's not dissimilar to the way at least when I was at the pal Fed that that we would be thinking not only about the January meeting and then start thinking about March but really the arc of the of of the year you know based upon your view of the data and and a number of other considerations. So those are some tangible examples of the way chairs I think put their imprint on the on the process.

### 前瞻性指引的争议

**Joe**: 所以，考虑到连续制定几个策略，我们看到**凯文·沃什**对前瞻性指引以及2008年、2009年等时期出现的一些货币政策创新持非常怀疑态度。我认为人们可能很容易忘记，点阵图、新闻发布会等都是非常现代的事物。在**美联储**的大部分历史中，这些都没有。您认为...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: So, thinking of calling several plays in a row, we've seen Kevin Wars very skeptical of forward guidance and some of the monetary policy innovations that occurred in 2008, 2009, and so forth. I think it's easy maybe for people to forget that things like the dots, the press conference, and so forth, these are all very modern. For most of the Fed's history, there was none of this stuff. Do you think...

</details>

**Tracy**: 我记得点阵图的发明吗？还记得吗？我们当时在尝试，我还是不明白，但是是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I remember the invention of the dot plot? Remember that? We were trying I still don't get it but yeah.

</details>

**Joe**: 嗯，我们当时在**彭博社**内部试图找出如何最好地翻译这些信息。您认为，抛开**沃什**的观点不谈，有没有理由认为，一些沟通创新在**零利率**时期很有意义，当时**美联储**试图说服市场它会长期维持低利率，但现在也许可以重新审视，在正常时期我们不需要这么多这样的东西？

<details>

**Joe**: Well, we were trying to figure out internally at Bloomberg like the best way to translate that information. Do you think I mean setting aside Worsh's view, do you think there's an argument to be made that some of these communication innovations that maybe made a lot of sense during a period of ZER where the Fed was trying to convince the market that it would be on hold for a very long time that maybe they can be revisited and we don't need so much of this stuff in normal times.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 是的。所以我想我们现在重点关注沟通，因为这是您的具体问题，但也许稍后也可以谈谈**凯文**的其他批评，这些批评主要涉及资产负债表，即资产负债表的规模和构成方面的“任务蔓延”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Yeah. So I think let's focus now on communication since that was your specific question but perhaps later also talk about Kevin's other critiques which are broadly the balance sheet sort of mission creep in the size and the composition of the balance sheet.

</details>

**Joe**: 然后第三个批评是，将**美联储**的政策，包括行动和沟通，更多地基于政策规则框架，而不是他所说的“逐次会议酌情决定”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: And then third critique is is grounding Fed policy both actions and communication more towards a policy rules framework and a less moving away from what he calls meeting by meeting discretion.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 让我们谈谈沟通。我观察、教授并实际做了四年。我想先从一个具有历史事实性的声明开始，这对于提供一些背景很重要。在没有任何前瞻性指引的情况下，完全有可能成功实施货币政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Let's talk about communication and having observed and taught this and actually done it for four years. I want to begin with a historically factual statement that's important to provide some context. It is perfectly possible to conduct a very successful monetary policy without any forward guidance.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: **保罗·沃尔克**做了八年，**艾伦·格林斯潘**做了17年。当然，会有一些小提示、暗示和点头，但我们今天所知的前瞻性指引，在**保罗·沃尔克**或**艾伦·格林斯潘**最初的17年任期内，真的不属于他们的工具箱。现在，**格林斯潘**总是令人着迷。关于**格林斯潘**最引人入胜的事情之一是，在他任期的最后两年，而且我要说，并非巧合的是，当时**本·伯南克**是**美联储**理事，就在2004年至2006年即将结束时，**格林斯潘**开始尝试前瞻性指引。但在大多数情况下，那并不是工具箱的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Paul Vulkar did it for eight years and Alan Greenspan did it for 17. You know, there would be little hints and winks and nods, but forward guidance as we know it today is really something that was not really in the toolkit of Paul Vulkar or for the first 17 years, Alan Greenspan. Now, Greenspan's endlessly fascinating. And one of the fascinating things about Greenspan is that in his last two years, and I would say not coincidentally at the time that Ben Bernani was a Fed governor, right at the very end in 2004 to six, Greenspan began to dip his his toe into forward guidance. But for the most part, that was not really part of the toolkit.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 那么，前瞻性指引首先是什么，它为什么会成为工具箱的一部分呢？嗯，在最基本的层面上，前瞻性指引是向观察者，更重要的是向金融市场提供关于委员会对利率路径预期的信息。现在，有大量的学术文献。我自己也为此做出了贡献。你可能会发现，这些文献中一个有趣且可能令人惊讶的地方是，20年前它花了很多时间争论前瞻性指引是无关紧要的，因为**美联储**关注通胀数据，市场也关注通胀数据。如果通胀太高，**美联储**就会加息。如果通胀低，他们就会降息。所以，如果你告诉人们你要做什么，而他们反正都知道你要做什么，你就不会真正获得任何增量的好处。因此，前瞻性指引的理由必须建立在“谈论你要做什么没关系”之外的其他基础上。前瞻性指引真正成为**美联储**关注的焦点，是出于**零利率下限**（**ZLB**）时的绝望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: So why did forward guide first of all then what is forward guidance and why it become part of the toolkit? Well, at its most basic level, forward guidance is providing information to observers and importantly to financial markets about the committee's expectation of the path for interest rates. Now, there's a huge academic literature. I've contributed to it myself. And one of the interesting things that you might find that's might be surprising about that literature is it spent a lot of time 20 years ago arguing that forward guidance was irrelevant because the Fed's looking at inflation data. The market's looking at inflation data. If inflation's too damn high, the Fed will raise rates. If it's low, they'll cut rates. So you don't really get any you don't really get any incremental benefit by telling people what you're going to do if they know you're going to do it anyway. And so the the case for forward guidance then has to then rest on something other than it's okay to talk about what you're going to do. And and where forward guidance really became a focus of the Fed was out of desperation at the zero bath.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 所以在**雷曼兄弟**破产后，利率被降到零。经济自由落体。金融系统濒临崩溃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: So rates got cut to zero after Lehman Brothers. The economy was in freef fall. The financial system was on the verge of collapse.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: **伯南克美联储**无法使用传统政策来降低利率，因为他们已经达到了零利率下限。因此，他们开始向市场提供指引，主要是为了安抚市场，让他们知道**美联储**不会轻易加息，因为他们不断注意到，即使经济疲软、通胀低、失业率高，债券市场仍在对他们无意实施的加息进行定价。因此，当前瞻性指引在**美联储**被困在零利率下限时，它确实发挥了重要作用。现在，一个有趣的推论是，当你将利率提高到零以上时，你会怎么做？当然，**鲍威尔美联储**做到了，从**耶伦**开始，然后**鲍威尔**也做到了，我实际上也亲身经历了那个周期中的加息。在我到任时，**美联储**已经开始，重要的是因为点阵图，**美联储**即使在利率高于零之后，也继续使用前瞻性指引，而且点阵图通常是其中的一个输入，因为它提供了不完美但可能对委员会调整利率的意图有用的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: And the Bernani Fed could not use conventional policy to lower rates because they had hit, you know, a zero bound. And so they began to provide guidance to the markets to essentially reassure markets that they were not on a hair trigger to hike rates because they kept noticing that even though the economy was weak, inflation was low, unemployment was high, the bond market kept pricing in rate hikes that they had no intention of delivering. And so forward guidance really took on an important role when the Fed was trapped at at at the zero bound. Now an interesting correlary then is what do you do when you raise rates above zero and of course the pal Fed did that beginning well yellen and then pal did that and I was actually there for the rate hikes in that in that cycle and the fed by the time I had arrived importantly because of the dots the Fed had begun to had continued to use forward guidance even after rates got above zero and oftentimes the dot plot was an input into that since it provides imperfect but potentially useful information about the committee's intention to adjust rates.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 不过，我想说，我认为**凯文·沃什**或任何成为**美联储**主席的人，现在思考前瞻性指引的成本和收益是完全合适的。事实上，我至少十年来一直说，包括在我加入**美联储**之前，前瞻性指引和**量化宽松**（**QE**）并非不受经济学规律的约束。它们有好处，但也有成本。可能存在边际收益递减。因此，我认为**美联储**在主席的领导下，思考前瞻性指引在有用和无用情况下的成本和收益，是完全恰当的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Let me say, however, that I think it's entirely appropriate that Kevin Worsh or anyone who becomes a Fed chair now think about the cost and benefits of forward guidance. Indeed, I've said for at least a decade, including before when I joined the Fed, that forward guidance and quantitative easing are not exempt from the laws of economics. They they have benefits but also costs. There are probably diminishing returns. And so I don't think it's at all inappropriate for the Fed under the leadership of the chair to think about benefits and cost of forward guidance in circumstances when it may be useful and circumstances when it may not be.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我再补充一点。**美联储**沟通的另一个维度变化，实际上是技术和获取方式变化的结果。所以，如果你回到1980年代，是的，当**沃尔克**发表演讲时，人们会阅读，**《纽约时报》**和**《华尔街日报》**会报道，但除此之外，**美联储**的沟通相当有限。当然，现在我们所有人都可以访问互联网和金融新闻，每位**美联储**主席和理事都会发表演讲，因此，关于委员会中个人认为合适的政策，以及正式指引，有更多的个人讨论。所以，我认为这就是我们今天在前瞻性指引方面的现状。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Let me just add a little kota here. Another dimension of Fed communication that's changed is really been the result of a change in technology and access. So, you know, if you go back to the 1980s, yes, when Vulkar gave a speech, people would read it and the Times and Wall Street Journal would report on it, but other than that, Fed communication was was pretty limited. And of course now of course we all have access to the internet and financial news and each Fed president and and Fed governor give speeches and so there's a lot more individual discussion of what individuals on the committee think would be appropriate policy as well as formal guidance as well. So I think that's that's sort of where we are on on forward guidance as of today.

</details>

**Tracy**: 接着问一个后续问题。从市场角度来看，我认为前瞻性指引自2008年、2009年以来，一直起到抑制波动性的作用，尤其是在债券市场。现在，如果前瞻性指引减少，似乎存在波动性回归的风险。从**PIMCO**的角度，也就是债券市场的角度来看，更少的前瞻性指引实际意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Just one followup to that. The way I think about it from a market perspective is that forward guidance you know since 2008 2009 has had the effect of dampening volatility especially in the bond market and now if you have less forward guidance it would seem perhaps there's a risk that volatility makes a return. Putting on your your PIMCO hat from the perspective of the bond market what would less forward guidance actually mean?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我认为您一语中的。我认为我能做出的最可靠的预测是，它会在一定程度上增加市场波动性，特别是利率波动性。重要的是，我将非常直接和坦率地说，在过去十年中，请记住，**全球金融危机**后，利率在七年内都处于零。**珍妮特·耶伦**直到2015年12月才加息。而且它们已经维持了七年不变。因此，不仅曲线前端的实际利率波动性很低，而且**美联储**还使用了大量前瞻性指引和**量化宽松**。这在很长一段时间内抑制了利率波动性。然后，即使**美联储**开始加息，因为它正在部署前瞻性指引，这也在边际上抑制了利率波动性。你可以看到，例如，**MOVE指数**，它基本上是一个债券市场指数。所以波动性降到了非常低的水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I think you hit the nail on the head. I think the most robust prediction I would make is it would it would in increase to some extent market volatility in particular interest rate volatility and importantly and I'll just be very direct and and and and blunt in the decade remember rates were at zero for seven years after the global financial crisis. Janet Yellen did not hike rates until December of 2015. And they've been on hold for seven years. And so not only was realized rate volatility low at the front end of the curve, but the Fed was using a lot of forward guidance and a lot of quantitative easing. And that was suppressing interest rate volatility for a very long period of time. And then even once the Fed began to lift off because it was deploying forward guidance that also served at the margin to suppress rate volatility. And you see this for example the move index which is a basically a bond market index. So volatility got down to very low levels.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 所以，过去几年在**鲍威尔美联储**领导下发生的一部分情况是，债券市场的隐含波动性相对于疫情前十年被压制的水平有所上升，但并未真正达到1990年代完全不寻常的水平。因此，我认为我的初步评估是，我们可能会回到我所说的更正常或**金融危机**前的利率波动水平。现在，在利率波动方面，**美联储**并非唯一的参与者。利率波动性上升的原因还有财政政策的不确定性。首先，我想说，我记得**美联储**在2009年曾担心市场是否认为**美联储**对通胀反应过于敏感。我认为很多人不记得这一点，但在2009年初，市场曾预计到2009年底会加息，回想起来这几乎令人难以置信，因为您提醒我们**美联储**七年没有加息。所以，当时**美联储**面临着非常严峻的挑战，要说服市场它会长期维持利率不变。我认为前瞻性指引在那方面显然发挥了特定的技术作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: So, so part of what has been happening really in the last several years under the PAL Fed is bond market implied volatility has gone up relative to the suppressed levels of the decade before the pandemic, but not really up to levels that were at all unusual back in the 1990s. And so I think my first order assessment is we may be going back to what I would call more normal or preGFC levels of rate volatility. Now the Fed is not the only only game in town when it comes to rate volatility. There's reasons for rate volatility to be elevated because of uncertainty about fiscal policy for example as as well. You know first of all I want to say you know I remember the concern that the Fed had in 2009 about does the market see the Fed as a hair trigger on inflation? I don't think a lot of people remember this, but in early 2009, the market was pricing in rate hikes by the end of 2009, which seems almost unbelievable in retrospect when you remind us that the Fed went seven years without a hike. So, there really was a very intense challenge on the Fed's hands to convince the market that it was going to stay on hold for a very long time. And I think forward guidance clearly played a sort of specific tech role there.

### 资产负债表政策的挑战

**Tracy**: 现在我们来谈谈资产负债表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Let's talk now about balance sheet.

</details>

**Joe**: **比尔·达德利**在**沃什**被提名后为**彭博观点**撰写了一篇专栏文章，他对沃什持批评态度。他说，他不认为**沃什**能够进一步缩减资产负债表，除非在银行资本要求等方面做出其他改变。**沃什**自己对资产负债表的批评在某些时候似乎有点像一个移动的目标。您对**沃什**即将与资产负债表政策可能产生的交集有什么看法？我的意思是，也许我会问，任何经济学家对资产负债表政策的影响有多大把握？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Bill Dudley wrote a column for Bloomberg Opinion after the Worsh nomination and he was sort of critical. He said he didn't think that Worsh was going to be able to shrink the balance sheet much further unless there were some other changes perhaps relating to banks capital requirements etc. Worsh's own criticisms of the balance sheet seem a little bit of a moving target at some point. How well do you I mean maybe I would ask how well does any economist have a handle on the effects of balance sheet policy but what's your read on sort of the reality of wars coming intersection perhaps with the balance sheet.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 是的，我认为这有两个相关但不同的要素。首先，**凯文**自第一个**量化宽松**（**QE1**）计划以来，一直公开且持续地批评**美联储**资产负债表的每一次扩张。所以他非常有名地表示反对2010年的**QE2**计划。尽管我认为他确实投了赞成票，但他很快就离开了。所以，存在一个回顾性的问题，即**美联储**不应该购买国债和抵押贷款支持证券。我认为没有理由认为他改变了主意。事实上，**贝桑特部长**写了一篇题为《**美联储**的“功能增益”货币政策》的极具煽动性的文章，他也在回顾中批评了**美联储**资产负债表的扩张。当然，对于**OddLot**的听众和市场来说，重要的问题是，好的，那是过去，展望未来，**凯文·沃什**在竞选**美联储**主席期间说的许多有趣的事情之一是呼吁**财政部**和**美联储**之间就资产负债表达成一项新的协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Yeah, so I think there are two related but distinct elements to this first is that Kevin has been publicly and consistently critical of every expansion in the Fed's balance sheet since the first QE1 program so he very famously said he was opposed to the QE2 program in 2010. Although I think he did vote for it, but then he left soon after. And so there's the issue of backwardlooking, oh, the Fed should not have been buying treasuries and mortgages as it did. And I think there's no reason to think he's changed his mind. Indeed, Secretary Bessant wrote a piece with a very provocative title, the Fed's, you know, gain of function monetary policy. And he was also critical in retrospect of the expansion in the Fed's balance sheet. The important question of course for for OddLot's listeners and for markets is okay that's the past looking ahead and one of the many interesting things that Kevin Walsh said during his I guess campaign to become Fed chair was to call for a new accord between the Treasury and the Fed with regards to the balance sheet.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 他没有提供很多细节。我们知道**美联储**和**财政部**之间的第一个协议是什么样的，那是在1951年。有趣的是，那本质上是**美联储**宣布独立，可以在未经**财政部**批准的情况下加息，这就是为什么**美联储**历史学家认为它是**美联储**历史上的一个标志性事件。所以，我认为这并不是一个真正的问题。现在，**凯文**所说的“协议”大概是指**美联储**和**财政部**之间就其资产负债表的规模和构成达成相互理解。例如，你可以同意**美联储**需要拥有当前规模的资产负债表，但它不应该持有抵押贷款支持证券或30年期国债。它应该持有短期国库券。所以，这是一个可以讨论的话题。你也可以讨论**美联储**拥有一个更小的资产负债表。我钦佩**比尔**，我读了他的专栏，并几乎完全同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Now he hasn't provided a lot of details. What we do know is what the first accord between the Fed and the Treasury looked like, which was back in 1951. And what was interesting about that, it was essentially the Fed's declaration of independence to raise rates without getting approval from the Treasury, which is why Fed historians think of it as really a signal event in Fed history. So, I don't think that's really an issue. Now, presumably what Kevin means when he talks about an accord is a mutual understanding between the Fed and the Treasury about the size and composition of its balance sheet. And so, for example, you could agree that the Fed needs to have the current size balance sheet, but it should not own mortgage back securities or 30-year Treasuries. It should own T bills. So, that's a conversation you can have. You can also also have a conversation about the Fed having a a smaller balance sheet. Admire of Bill and I I read that column and agreed with almost all of it.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 关键在于，从这里到那里并非一帆风顺，特别是它涉及银行系统中的准备金水平。**美联储**一直非常谨慎，尽管它曾被诱惑并讨论过出售抵押贷款支持证券。你可以在过去十几年甚至二十年的会议记录中找到这些讨论。所以现在，现有**美联储**没有兴趣通过任何形式的出售来缩减资产负债表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: The point being is is to get from here to there is is not straightforward and in particular it involves the banking system in terms of the level of reserves in the banking system. The Fed has been very reticent although it's been tempted and it's discussed selling mortgage back securities. You can find it in the transcripts going back a dozen years and two years. And so right now there is no appetite in the existing Fed to think about shrinking the balance sheet through any sort of a any sort of a sale.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 最后，我确实想把这一点提出来，因为我认为这是一个非常重要但常常被不完全理解的观点：2008年，与**全球金融危机**同时发生的是，**美联储**还从国会获得了向银行准备金支付利息的法定权力。在此之前，**美联储**通过购买证券来创造准备金，但这些准备金的利率为零。现在，不仅**美联储**，大多数其他中央银行都向银行准备金支付市场利率。这之所以重要，原因如下：这意味着当**美联储**实施**量化宽松**（**QE**）计划时，当它购买抵押贷款支持证券或国债时，它并不是以那种“货币与银行”的意义上的印钞，即你购买一张票据并用100美元钞票支付，从而消灭票据支付。**美联储**现在通过现代**量化宽松**和准备金利息所做的，并不是消灭政府债务。它只是将政府债务的期限结构从固定利率改为浮动利率。因为归根结底，**美联储**的资产负债表和**财政部**的资产负债表是合并的。当**美联储**盈利时，**财政部**会获得这些利息收入。近年来，**美联储**一直没有盈利，并一直在扣留这些汇款。所以，一旦你这样想，你就会开始考虑这样一种情景：**财政部长**如果选择，可以说：“你知道吗，我希望在期限构成方面成为镇上的大警长。”所以，如果我认为30年期国债太多了，我就会购买它们并出售短期国库券，而**美联储**可以购买短期国库券。所以，随着时间的推移，存在我们可以重新思考**量化宽松**是什么，以及资产负债表规模是什么的情景。但这并不是一个30分钟或一周就能完成的任务。这将是一个相当复杂而错综复杂的过程。但我不想排除这是一种值得考虑或讨论的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: And then finally and I and I do want to get this on the table because I think it's a very important point that is often imperfectly appreciated is the following. In 2008, coincident with the global financial crisis, the Fed also achieved from Congress the statutory authority to pay interest on bank reserves. Until that point, the Fed created reserves by buying securities, but they earned a zero interest rates. And that not just the Fed, but most other central banks now pay a market rate of interest on bank reserves. And the reason why that's important is the following. What it means is that when the Fed does do a QE program, when it buys a mortgage security or a Treasury, it's not really printing money in the sort of money and banking sense that you're buying a coupon and paying for it with a $100 bill and thus extinguishing the coupon payment. What you're really what the Fed really does now with modern QE and interest on reserves is it's not extinguishing government debt. It's just changing the maturity composition of government debt from fixed to floating. Because at the end of the day, the Fed's balance sheet and the Treasury's balance sheet are consolidated. When the Fed's profitable, the the the Treasury gets that interest income. In recent years, the Fed has not been profitable and it's been withholding those remittances. And so once once you think of it that way, then you start to think about a scenario where a Treasury Secretary could, if he chose to say, you know what, I want to be the big sheriff in town when it comes to maturity composition. So if I think there are too many 30-year treasuries, I'll buy them and sell T bills and the Fed can buy the T bills. And so there are scenarios over time where we could rethink what QE is in addition to what the size of the balance sheet is. But this is not, you know, a 30 minute or you know a oneweek exercise. This will be a pretty complicated intricate process. But I don't want to rule out of hand that it's something that is you know beyond considering or discussing.

</details>

### 沃什对经济模型的看法

**Joe**: 除了他对**美联储**资产负债表的规模和潜在构成的不满之外，**沃什**似乎还有其他不喜欢的东西，那就是传统的经济模型。例如，他一直批评**菲利普斯曲线**。他还批评**美联储**的数据依赖性，这引出了一个问题：如果你不关注数据，也不关注模型，那你到底用什么来制定货币政策？您对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: So other than his distaste for the size and potentially composition of the Fed balance sheet, there's something else that Worsh doesn't seem to like, and that's I guess traditional economic models. So he's been critical of the Phillips curve for instance. He's been critical of data dependency at the Fed which kind of leaves the question if you're not going to focus on data and you're not going to focus on models what are you actually using to formulate monetary policy? Do you have any any read on what that could be?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我认识**凯文**大概有十几年了。我们的**美联储**官员任期没有重叠，但我后来认识了他，我们见过很多次，也聊过很多次。我读过他写的大部分文章。我的感觉是，他的批评实际上是认为宏观经济学中很多经济模型倾向于过多强调经济的需求侧。现在，我可以指出我在2018年10月作为**美联储**副主席的第一次演讲，当时我也提出了政策需要考虑经济的供给侧，而且**美联储**不希望因为太多人有工作而加息，如果这不导致通胀的话。而你解决这个问题的办法，就是你对生产力的展望。所以，如果经济因为创新或放松管制而变得更具生产力，从而实现更快增长，那么**美联储**就不应该阻碍它，这是正确的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I think you know and I've known Kevin I think for a dozen years. I didn't our our terms as fed officials did not coincide, but I've gotten to know him since and we've met many times and had many conversations and the like and I read most if not all that he writes. You know, my my sense is really that his his critique is that a lot of economic models in macro tend to to put a lot of emphasis on on the demand side of the economy. Now I can point you to my first speech as Fed vice chair in October 2018 where I also put on the table that policy need to think about the supply side of the economy and the Fed doesn't want to be in the business of raising rates because too many people have a job if that's not inflationary and the the way you sort of square that circle is your outlook on on on productivity. And so it is correct that if you get more growth because you've got a more productive economy either through innovation or deregulation then the Fed should not get in in the way of that.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 事实上，在我任职期间，**鲍威尔美联储**并没有这样做。你知道，2019年**美联储**内外模型都在说，事实上，如果你看2017年的**美联储**沟通，它在说，如果失业率低于5%，我们就必须加息，因为那会导致通胀。而当我到任时，失业率在4%左右，我们没有通胀，它甚至降到了3%以下。所以，经济确实有供给侧和需求侧。如果供给侧能够以更高的就业率更快增长而没有通胀，**美联储**就不应该阻碍它。所以，我100%同意这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: And indeed during my time the pal Fed didn't you know the models both in the Fed and outside in 2019 were saying and indeed if you look at Fed communication in 2017 it was saying if the unemployment rate falls below 5% we'll have to hike rates because that's going to be inflationary and by the time I got there the unemployment rate was in the fours and we didn't have inflation and it got down to the low threes. And so it is correct that there is a supply as well as a demand side to the economy. And if the supply side can grow faster with higher employment without inflation, the Fed should not get in the way with that. So I I 100% agree with with with that.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 现在，挑战在于经济，正如**杰伊·鲍威尔**所说，经济是不断变化的。也许只是给听众中的“书呆子”们一点点“书呆子”评论。让我澄清一下。你知道，老话说“事实是顽固的东西”。我们所有人都生活在1990年代。**格林斯潘**理所当然地受到了赞扬，他确实应该受到赞扬。事实上，当我教授这些材料时，我总是强调这个时期，因为他认识到由于互联网、连接性和个人计算，生产力可能会显著提高。工作人员和其他理事们当时说我们应该加息，但**格林斯潘**说：“不，让我们看看。这可能是一场由生产力驱动的繁荣。”这确实是1995年至1999年间的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Now the the challenge is the economy, as Jay Palace said, the economy is constantly changing. And maybe just a little a little bit of a wonkish comment for the the wonks in your audience. And and let me set the record straight. You know, the old saying, facts are stubborn things. And we all live, you know, we're all three of us were around in the 1990s. And Greenspan is justly complimented as he should be indeed what I teach this material. I always emphasize this period for recognizing that because of the internet and connectivity and personal computing that there would potentially was an eminent increase in pickup in productivity. And the staff and other governors were saying we should hike rates and green spend. And I said, "No, let's see. We may get this may be a productivity-led boom and that's indeed the story between 1995 and 1999.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 但如果你看1999年的**格林斯潘美联储**，即使在生产力增长非常强劲、经济增长强劲、股市非常活跃的情况下，它仍在加息。人们忘记的是，到2000年，联邦基金利率已经达到6.5%。所以，**格林斯潘**确实推迟了几年，但到那个科技互联网繁荣时期结束时，恕我直言，他著名的“非理性繁荣”说法，**格林斯潘**在生产力增长非常强劲的情况下，仍在非常积极地加息。所以，当人们赞许地提到那个时期，作为**美联储**应该推迟加息或继续降息的原因时，你必须看整个十年。你不能只挑三四年。

<details>

**Richard Clarida**: But if you look at the greenspan Fed in 1999 it was hiking rates even though we had very strong productivity growth and we had strong economic growth in the face of a very buoyant stock market and what people forget is that by 2000 the federal funds rate was at 6 and a half% so it is true that Greenspan did hold off for several years, but by the end of that of that tech internet boom and dare I say irrational exuberance, his famous phraseology, Greenspan was hiking rates very aggressively in the face of very strong productivity growth. So when people refer to that period approvingly as a reason for the Fed to hold off from from you know hiking or certainly continuing to cut rates because of productivity you have to look at the entire decade. You just can't cherrypick three or four years.

</details>

**Tracy**: 这很有趣。既然我们谈到这里，谈谈**格林斯潘**。我的意思是，他为什么如此积极地加息？**格林斯潘**在90年代末期的加息，是否与他自己关于经济在生产力扩张时期能够增长的评论不符？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: This is interesting. You know, just while we're here, talk about Green Greenspan. I mean, why did he raise rates so aggressively? And did Greenspan's own rate hikes in the late '9s not really gel with his own comments about the capacity for the economy to grow during a time of expanding productivity?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我认为解释实际上是双重的。我确实认为，到那时，尽管我没有记住回忆录，但我认为到那时，“非理性繁荣”是一个因素。存在财富效应，所以如果股票上涨，人们变得富有，他们就会花更多钱。所以中央银行不喜欢刺破泡沫，但一个估值非常高的股票市场和你的宏观经济展望之间存在联系。我们都记得，我们中的一些人记得**Pets.com**，你知道，那个袜子木偶的**超级碗**广告。而且我认为，到那时，尽管通胀没有超过，我还应该提到那个时期另一个引人入胜的事情是，从会议记录中现在可以清楚地看出，**格林斯潘美联储**在90年代中期到后期，本质上是在运行我们现在所说的通胀目标制，目标是2%。但**格林斯潘**一直抵制**美联储**应该公开表示他们将2%作为通胀目标的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: The explanation, I would argue, was really was really twofold. I I do think by that time although I haven't memorized the memoir but but I think by that time the the irrational exuberance piece was a factor there is a there is a wealth effect so if stocks are going up people are wealthy they spend more and so central banks don't like to be in the business of of pricking bubbles but there is a connectivity between a very very fully valued stock market and your macro outlook you know we all remember some of us remember Pets.com you know the sock puppet Super Bowl commercials and also I just think by that point although inflation had not moved above I should also mention the other fascinating thing about that period is it's clear now from the transcripts that the Greenspan Fed by the mid to late 90s was in essence running what we would now call an inflation targeting regime and that the target was two but Greenspan was always resistant to the idea the Fed should ever publicly say that they were targeting 2% inflation.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 但到90年代末，通胀已经接近2%，你真的可以把这看作是**格林斯潘**基本上在说：“我不想回到8%、7%、5%通胀的糟糕旧时代。”所以，这可能也是一种预防性措施，不是抵制生产力，而只是试图保持经济平衡。我最后要说的是，抱歉有点书呆子气，但从经济模型来看，在其他条件相同的情况下，如果生产力增长更快，你会预期这会提高经济学家所说的中性利率。我认为**比尔·达德利**在他的专栏中也提到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: But by the late 90s you have inflation moving up close to 2% and you could really I view this as a period where Greenspan's basically saying I don't want to go back to the bad old days of 8 7 5% you know inflation and so it was probably preemptive as well not resisting the productivity but merely trying to to keep the economy in in balance and then the final thing I'll say sorry to be wonky is that as a matter of economic modeling other things being equal if you've got faster productivity growth, you'd expect that to move up what economists call the neutral rate of interest anyway. And I think actually Bill Dudley made that point in his column as well.

</details>

**Tracy**: 在这个节目上，永远不要为书呆子气道歉。

### 央行独立性与政治压力

**Tracy**: 我想回到央行独立性的问题。所以，如果我们假设**沃什**真的想在不受总统影响的情况下做自己的事情，当然有些人对此表示怀疑，但如果我们接受这个前提，当总统喜欢谈论利率，并且像我们之前说的，喜欢开玩笑说“如果**沃什**不降息，我就起诉他”时，他如何实际展示或证明央行的独立性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I want to go back to the question of central bank independence. So if if we assume that Worsh truly wants to do his own thing outside of presidential influence and again there are there are some people who doubt that is the case but if we take that premise how does he actually display or demonstrate the central bank's independence when you have a president who likes to talk about interest rates and likes to joke as we were saying earlier about you know I'm going to sue War if he doesn't lower rates.

</details>

**Joe**: 您还在**凯文·沃什**的“竞选”中使用了“竞选”这个词，我认为这是一个有趣的词语选择来描述过去几个月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: You also use the word campaign in you Kevin Wars's campaign, which I thought was an interesting choice of words to describe the last several months.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 没关系。他是一个非常好的选择。还有另外三位候选人，而且成功了。我认为**特雷西**，我们很快会看到几件事。事实上，我会让您和您的听众来决定这是否是个玩笑。但我发现一件有趣的事情，我会和您分享，那就是，如果**杰伊·鲍威尔**真的想让他的继任者处境复杂，他会在3月和4月的会议上降息，将联邦基金利率降到委员会似乎认为的目标水平，这样下一个人就无事可做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: That's okay. He's he's he's a very he's a good choice. And there there were three other candidates and and and it worked. I think I think there'll be a couple things Tracy that that we'll we'll see pretty soon. In fact, I'll let I'll let you and your listeners decide if it's a it's a joke. But one thing I find humorous, I'll share with you is that, you know, if if if JPL really wanted to complicate the situation for his successor, you know, he cut rates at the March and the and the April meeting to get the funds rate down to the level where at least the committee seems to think is the destination so that there's nothing for the next person to do.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 我不认为**鲍威尔**会那样做，因为我不认为这是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I don't think Powell's going to to do that because I don't think it's...

</details>

**Joe**: 通过“钓鱼”来制定货币政策。我不知道那是不是**鲍威尔**的风格，但这会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Monetary policy by trolling. I don't know if that's a that doesn't sound like a Powell thing, but that would be funny.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 是的，但是，你知道，这确实有一点道理，正如我们之前在播客中说的，主席的权力是说服力。**沃什**只有一票。你有一些非常引人注目且自信的人。正如你的听众所知，有一个投票轮换机制。所以现在，像**贝丝·汉莫克**、**洛里·洛根**、明尼苏达州的**尼尔·卡什卡里**以及费城的**安娜·保尔森**都在投票。我相信，**洛里·洛根**、**汉莫克**和**卡什卡里**不会在公开场合或会议中羞于表达他们的不同意见，如果他们认为（我不是说**沃什**会这样做）我们会继续将利率降到委员会普遍认为的中性利率，即目标利率，在3%左右，比如3.25%或3%的某个水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Yeah, but you know, but but but but there is a kernel of of truth to it, which is as we said earlier in the in the podcast, the power of the chair is the power of persuasion. Wars will only have one vote. You've got some very very highprofile and confident people. There's a voting rotation as your listeners know. So right now you've got folks like Beth Hammock and you've got Lori Logan, Neil Qashqari in Minnesota are are voting now and and Anna Pollson in in Philadelphia. I I believe and you know and Lori Logan and and and and Hammock and and Kosh Curry will not will not be shy publicly or I'm sure in the meetings if they disagree with what they would perceive and I'm not saying wars would do this as you know we're going to keep cutting rates below a level where the committee seems to have a broad sense that the neutral rate the destination rate is going to be somewhere in the low threes you know three and a quarter three whatever.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 所以我确实认为，在经济的基线情景下，我们可能会在今年某个时候达到那个利率水平，然后到那时，问题将取决于是否存在政治压力，以及**沃什美联储**将如何应对。我的感觉是，尽管讨论了**人工智能**和放松管制的供给侧好处，但如果未来降息的暗示或讨论会引发金融市场的紧张，导致盈亏平衡通胀上升，预期通胀指标上升，我认为**沃什**会，而且我认为**沃什**和**美联储**会认真对待。所以我的解读是，他会根据数据来应对。他会想专注于供给侧，但归根结底，没有哪个**美联储**主席希望在历史书上留下“浪费了40年物价稳定”的骂名。所以，归根结底，这可能就是总统在不止一个场合考虑选择谁时所指的。我是在转述，但他大概说了这样的话：“人们会说一套，然后上任后又让你失望。”所以，我认为这是这个机构和委员会结构的一个要素，将继续具有相关性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: And so I do think that we'll under the sort of baseline scenario for the economy we we may get to that level of rates sometime this year and then at that point the issue would be depending on if there's political pressure on on how the worst Fed would navigate that and my sense is notwithstanding all the discussion of the supply side benefits of of AI and and deregulation you know if if the hint or the discussion of a future rate cut would would trigger nervousness in the financial markets, break even inflations go up, expected inflation measures go up. You know, I think Worsh would and I think War and the Fed would take that seriously. So my my read is that he will he will navigate the data as it comes. He'll he'll want to focus on the supply side, but but at the end of the day, look, no no no no no Fed chair wants to go down in the history books as the Fed chair that squandered 40 years of price of stability. And and so at the end of the day, and this is I think perhaps what the president was referring to on more than one occasion when he was thinking about who he was going to choose. I'm paraphrasing, but he said something like, you know, people will say one thing and then they get in the job and they disappoint you. And so I think that that's an element of the of the institution and of the committee structure that will continue to be relevant.

</details>

**Tracy**: 这太有趣了。我的意思是，有趣的是，当您提到40年的普遍物价稳定时。有趣的是，像**亚瑟·伯恩斯**这样的名字，因为通胀而声名狼藉。然而，**伯南克**，你知道，他经历了**大金融危机**，有史以来最严重的经济衰退，但总体上他被认为是一位非常优秀的央行行长。所以，令人震惊的是，是的，如果你有几年的通胀，一切都会被说成“哦，你是个灾难”。但如果你在任期内经历了一场大衰退，总体上你仍然可以拥有一个相当好的声誉。不过我想问，现在我们仍然有高于目标的通胀，也许**人工智能**会推动生产力繁荣，让经济以低利率等方式快速增长。但就目前而言，我们甚至还没有回到2%的水平，而且**人工智能**的许多好处仍然非常理论化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: It's so interesting. I mean something that's interesting is when we you mentioned the 40 years of general price stability. It's interesting that like Arthur Burns that is a name that has a lot of it's been tarnished right because of the inflation. And yet Bernani, who you know went through the the great financial crisis, the worst downturn ever, by and large is remembered as having been a very good central bank chief. And so it's striking that, yeah, you have a few years of inflation, everything, oh, you're a disaster. But if you have a great recession underneath your term, by and large, you could still have a pretty good reputation. I want to ask though, you know, the thing is right now we still have above target inflation and maybe AI will drive a productivity boom and allow the economy to grow very fast with low rates etc. In the here and now though we we haven't even gotten back to 2% yet and so and a lot of these benefits of AI still very theoretical.

</details>

### 人工智能对通胀的影响

**Richard Clarida**: 是的。嗯，我会更直白地说。我认为你可以提出一个论点，尽管长期来看，随着生产力效益的到来，**人工智能**将是反通胀的，但你也可以提出一个非常合理的论点，即从现在到那时，用于训练模型的资本支出建设将会在生产力效益出现之前，在一个充分就业的经济体中增加需求。所以，如果我还在教中级宏观经济学，这实际上将是一个非常有趣的案例研究，可以在黑板上讨论：五年后，你的人均GDP会更高。这很棒。这是反通胀的。但从现在到第五年之间，你将把你的科技资本支出投资翻倍，这在生产力效益显现之前就增加了需求。所以，对我来说，**人工智能**对近期货币政策意味着什么，这根本不是一个板上钉钉的简单问题，尽管也许五年后生产力效益会非常大，它会以不同的方式，倾向于反通胀。所以，我认为**人工智能**在你能想到的每个维度上都是复杂的。它是一种复杂的技术。它具有复杂的经济和社会潜在影响，我认为这对中央银行来说也不是一个板上钉钉的简单局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: Yeah. Well, I I I'll I'll be even more blunt. I I think you can make a case that although longer term AI will be disinflationary as the productivity benefits arrive, you can I think you make a very plausible case that between between now and then the capex buildout to train the models is going to be increasing demand in a fully employed economy before the productivity benefits arise. And so if I were still teaching intermediate macro, this would actually be a pretty interesting case study to go on on the chalkboard that in 5 years you've got more GDP per worker. That's great. That's disinflationary. But between now and year five, you're going to be double doubling your tech capital spending investment, which is adding demand before the productivity benefits show up. So it's not a slam dunk to me at all about what about what AI means for for monetary policy near-term even though maybe in five years the productivity benefits are so large it it will it will have a different you know tend to be disinflationary. So I think it's AI is complicated along every dimension you can think. It's a complicated technology. It has complicated economics and social potential ramifications and I think it's it's not a slam dunk easy situation for the for the central bank either.

</details>

### 央行独立性的未来

**Richard Clarida**: 我还有一个关于央行独立性的最后一个问题。抛开**沃什**的评论不谈，我们完全没有谈到的一件事是，针对**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**关于办公室翻修的传票。**鲍威尔**非常明确地表示，他认为传票的动机是惩罚他，或者试图报复他实施了总统不喜欢的利率政策。与此相关的两件事。A，在您看来，这份传票是否增加了您对中央银行在美国真正独立机构的持续时间（无论是中期还是长期）的担忧？以及一个推论，您提到**鲍威尔**通过降息来控制**沃什**。现在，您认为他作为理事的任期结束之前，即使他不再担任主席，他留在理事会的可能性有多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I have one last question about central bank independence. Setting aside Wars's comments, something we haven't talked about at all is the subpoena to Jerome Powell over the um over the offices over the renovation. Powell was very specific in that he thought the subpoena was motivated by punishing him or trying to get back at him for doing rate policy that the president didn't like. Two things related to that. A, does the subpoena in your view sort of add to your worry either medium or long term about how long the central bank truly will be an independent institution in the United States. And a correlary to that, you mentioned Powell control the uh wars by cut doing all the rate cuts. Now, what do you see as the odds that he stays on the board until his term as governor ends even if he's no longer chair?

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 首先，有先例，**美联储**是一个非常非常注重先例的机构。传奇的**美联储**主席**马里纳·埃克尔斯**，甚至有一栋大楼以他的名字命名，他是**富兰克林·罗斯福**任命的。后来**哈里·杜鲁门**成为总统时，**哈里·杜鲁门**任命了另一位**美联储**主席，而**埃克尔斯**留任了，实际上成为了**杜鲁门**的一个真正麻烦。如果**杰伊·鲍威尔**继续担任理事直到他的任期结束（到2020年1月），我会感到惊讶。如果他再留任一两次会议，我会震惊吗？不会。只有**鲍威尔**自己知道。他被问过这个问题几十次了，他总是给出相同的答案。但我感觉他可能不会留任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: First of all, there is there is precedent and the Fed's a very very president focused institution. Legendary Fed chair indeed had a building named after him. Mariner Eckles was an FDR appointee and then when Harry Truman became president, Harry Truman named another Fed chair and Eckles stayed on and and actually became a real thorn in Truman's side. I would be surprised if J. Pal stays on for the remainder of his term as governor, which which runs through January of 2020. Would I be shocked if he stayed for a meeting or or two? No. Only Powell knows. He's been asked that question two dozen times and he always gives the same answer. But but I sense he's probably not going to be staying on, you know, in terms of this case, you know, I pal's comments can can um you know, stand for themselves.

</details>

**Richard Clarida**: 就这个案例而言，**鲍威尔**的评论可以不言自明。我不会介入。不过我想说的是，我们不仅有您刚刚提到的关于大楼调查的当前事件，我们还有**丽莎·库克**的案例。这将对这件事产生影响。所有这些都与国会能否建立一个具有一定独立性来提高或降低利率的中央银行这一理念紧密相连。其中一个重要因素是“有因罢免”的理念。除此之外，它只会自行发展，我没有任何关于它将如何结束的特定专业知识。但我会说，归根结底，我确实期望**美联储**作为一个机构，将拥有足够的独立性来提高或降低利率，因为它具有制度结构，而且我认为最终法院会支持这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard Clarida**: I won't weigh in. What I will say though is we have not only this the current thing that you just mentioned about investigation on the on the building, you know, we also have the Lisa Cook case. Is going to weigh in on on on that. And this is all sort of tied up into this idea of can Congress establish a central bank with a degree of independence to raise or lower rates. And an important element of this is this idea of four cause removal. You know, beyond that, it's just going to play out and I don't have any particular expertise about where it will end. But I will say is at the end of the day I do expect that the Fed is an institution and it's will have sufficient independence to raise or lower rates because of its institutional structure and I think ultimately the courts are going to back that up.

### 总结与反思

**Joe**: 那么，这是一次非常有趣的对话。我喜欢，或者说我很好奇，通过“钓鱼”来制定货币政策的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: So, that was a really fun conversation. I like the idea or I'm not sure I like I am intrigued by the idea of monetary policy by trolling.

</details>

**Tracy**: 如果**凯文**上任时已经没有降息空间，那会非常有趣，然后他就无法实现任何降息的意愿。但我认为这实际上提出了一个重要观点，我回想起我们与**艾米·中村**的对话，她谈到中央银行如何建立一种信誉储备，然后在不同时期不得不动用它。如果一位总统对利率如此固执己见，并且毫不避讳地在推特上或公开谈论它们，我觉得这本身就开始消耗一些信誉，因为我认为要展示你的独立性变得非常非常困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: That'd be so funny if there was like no room left to cut by the time Kevin got there and then he couldn't fulfill any inclination to cut. But I think it actually raises an important point and I'm thinking back to the conversation we did with Emmy Nakamura where she talks about central banks building up a sort of store of credibility and then having to spend it at various points. If you have a president who is so opinionated when it comes to interest rates and certainly not shy about tweeting or talking about them, I feel like it inherently starts to spend down some of that credibility because it just becomes very very difficult I think to demonstrate your own independence.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的，我认为这会非常棘手。你知道，这显然是我们上周和**斯坎德**讨论过的事情，那就是有多个潜在的被提名人，他们此时都愿意进一步降息。**克里斯托弗·沃勒**就是一个明显的例子。他一直在投票支持降息，但他也很有信誉，因为他在2022年、2023年等时期投票支持加息。所以，我认为这对**沃什**来说会很棘手。但另一方面，我认为，说“哦，他必须上任，他必须建立信誉”很容易。很多人真的很喜欢他。很多在不同时期与他合作过、认识他的人都认为他是一个严肃的思想家，他知道自己在说什么，即使他并不总是同意他们的观点，特别是在与资产负债表沟通相关的事情上，他也是一个诚实的中间人。所以也许，我们夸大了风险，或者说，他上任后会面临一场真正的斗争才能实现他想要的政策议程，这种风险很容易被夸大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah, I think it's going to be really tricky. You know, it's obviously something we talked about with Scand last week, which is that there's multiple potential nominees who would have come in with a willingness to cut rates further at this point. Christopher Waller being an obvious one. He's been voting for rate cuts, but he also has a lot of credibility because he was voting for rate hikes and, you know, 2022, 2023, and so forth. I think it's going to be uh, you know, it'll be tricky for War and But on the other hand, look, I would say also, you know, it's easy to say, oh, he's got to come in, he's got to build credibility. A lot of people really like him. A lot of people who have worked with him at various times, who have known him think he's a serious thinker, that he knows what he's talking about, that even if he doesn't always agree with them, particularly on things related to the balance sheet communication, that he's a honest broker. So maybe, you know, maybe we are overstating the risks or maybe it's easy to overstate the risk that he comes in and has a real fight on his hands to get the policy agenda that he wants.

</details>

**Tracy**: 哦，要是能成为**沃什**第一次会议上的旁观者就好了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Oh, to be a fly on the wall of the first meeting with War, right?

</details>

**Joe**: 是的，那会非常非常有趣。我还真的很想知道他是否会取消新闻发布会。这是我的预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah, that'll it'll be uh it'll be super interesting. I also really like I wonder if he's going to get rid of the press conference. That's my prediction.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我不会感到惊讶。你知道我会怎么说，这些都是新事物。这不像他会推翻80年的先例。这是一个非常现代的东西。而且很多沟通创新，正如**里奇**所说，在**美联储**处于零利率下限时，都有一个非常具体的目的，就是为了说服市场它会保持低位，因为他们需要证明这一点。所以，如果对所有这些**金融危机**后的货币政策变化进行一次诚实的审视，我当然认为这完全没问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I would not be surprised. And you know what I'll say like these are new things. It's not a it's it's not like he'd be overturning 80 years of president here. This is a very modern thing. And a lot of the communications innovations were as rich said a very specific purpose when the Fed was at Zerp to convince the market that it would stay low because and they needed to make that case. So if there's a sort of honest look at all of these postGFC monetary policy changes, I don't I I certainly think that's totally fine.

**Joe**: 我觉得**杰克逊霍尔**会议也可能面临危险。
