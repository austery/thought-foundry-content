### 加拿大防务开支激增

**主持人**: 加拿大即将大举投资国防，我是说真的大举。根据议会预算官的说法，达到**北约（NATO）5%的目标**将需要到2035年投入**1590亿美元**的国防开支，而总理**马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）**已明确表示这是他的目标。但我们如何才能实现这一目标，这些钱又该花到哪里去呢？我们知道政府想购买战斗机，尽管他们还没有决定购买美国的飞机是否仍然是正确的选择。但我们武装部队的未来以及那数十亿美元的开支将不仅仅局限于军事装备。我们将分析加拿大的国防开支和优先事项可能是什么样的，以及该国的制造商是否已准备好扩大生产以满足需求。这是《The Rundown》。我们知道这项新的军事计划将伴随着高昂的代价。那么，让我们来谈谈在这里明智的支出会是什么样子，以及政府是否负担得起不断增长的赤字。**安·菲茨-杰拉德（Ann Fitz-Gerald）**是**鲍尔希利国际事务学院（Balsillie School of International Affairs）**的主任，也是**威尔弗里德·劳里尔大学（Wilfrid Laurier University）**的政治学教授，**菲利普·拉加西（Philippe Lagasse）**是**卡尔顿大学（Carleton University）诺曼·帕特森国际事务学院（Norman Paterson School of International Affairs）**的副教授兼**巴顿讲席教授**。我想先问你。去年3月，总理马克·卡尼下令审查加拿大从美国购买一些**F-35**飞机的交易。目前，我们暂时只购买16架。请帮助我们理解，这即将满一年了。为什么这个决定需要这么长时间？

**Host**: >> Canada is about to spend big
on defence and I mean big.
According to the parliamentary
budget officer, hitting NATO's
5% target will call for $159
billion in defence spending by
2035, and Prime Minister Mark
Carney has made it clear that's
his goal.
But how do we get there and
where should all that money go?
We know the government wants to
buy fighter jets, although it
hasn't decided yet whether
buying American is still the
right move.
But the future of our armed
forces and those billions of
dollars will go beyond military
equipment.
We break down what Canada's
defence spending and priorities
could look like, and whether the
country's manufacturers are
ready to ramp up to meet the
need.
This is The Rundown.
We know this new plan for our
military is going to come with a
hefty price tag.
So let's talk about what smart
spending would look like here
and whether the government can
afford a growing deficit.
Ann Fitz-Gerald is the director
of the Balsillie School of
International Affairs and
professor of political science
at Wilfrid Laurier University,
and Philippe Lagasse is
associate professor and Barton
Chair at Carleton University's
Norman Paterson School of
International Affairs.
And I want to start with you.
Last March, Prime Minister Mark
Carney ordered a review of
Canada's purchase of some F-35
aircrafts from the US.
At the moment, we are buying
just 16 for now.
Help us understand we are about
to near the one year mark of
this.
What is the why is the decision
taking so long?

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> Well, I think many things are
affecting the decision.
It's an important decision.
It's a decision that's going to
last for for decades into the
future.
It's important capability, not
just for the Canadian Armed
Forces, but for our critical
infrastructure needs.
More broadly, the issue speaks
to a number of strategic
concerns, expanding our the
choices and our procurement
options moving forward and not
being so reliant on certain
national suppliers.
The issue concerns
interoperability with other
allies, our NATO allies, our
allies in the US and of course,
cost and platform sophistication
and the needs that we have that
complement other defence and
security investments here in
Canada.
What will best help those needs,
complement those needs in a way
that works for the broader
defence mission, more details of
which we are going to hear more
of as the Defence Industrial
Strategy becomes released.

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> Philippe, I'll get your take
on that as well.
There's a number of different
factors, not the least of which
is operating a mixed fleet of
F-35s and other fighter would be
very difficult for the Canadian
Air Force at this moment.
Already we're struggling with
pilots and technicians and the
infrastructure costs of setting
up the F-35, where you'd add
another fleet that would be
quite significant as well.
Interoperability with **NORAD**
isn't simply alongside the
United States, which is a bi
national command for the defence
of North America isn't simply a
question of working with.
When people hear
interoperability, they just
assume that it must be, you
know, just kind of communicating
like over a radio.
It's much more comprehensive
than that.
And contemporary warfare, the
F-35 integrates into a wider
system of systems.
And the American ambassador has
told us in no uncertain terms
that if we acquire a European
fighter, some of that
integration may be called into
question.
But frankly, I think we're
dealing with two things here.
Either the government is hoping
to put pressure on **Lockheed Martin**
for more economic
benefits, and potentially on the
white House leading up to
Canada's renegotiation of free
trade.
Or the government is seriously
contemplating trying to get
economic benefits and stand up a
Canadian defence industrial base
by building a fighter here in
Canada.
But the reason it's taking so
long is the cost is extremely
high to do that.

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> We don't really do strategy
in Canada, or we haven't done it
in a very long time.
We are followers.
So our strategy when it comes to
international peace and security
has largely been to follow what
our largest ally has, has done.
Similarly, the NATO alliance
provides us some guidance in
terms of fundamentals, but
really we don't do strategy.
We we we try and make sure that
our flag is in the right place.
When you look at maps of
operations and over the past 40
years, I would argue that
certainly on a military level,
what are we tried to do?
We've tried to plug and play
into the American armed forces.
And why?
Because it's really cheap to do
that as opposed to trying to
forge your own path.

**Host**: >> And what would you say are

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> Well, I think Philippe raised
the most important one for me,
and that is that we don't do
strategy.
So policy there's a difference
between policy and strategy.
Policy is a declaration of
intent.
Strategy speaks to the execution
imperatives, the sequencing, the
timelines, the resources that
would be used on a month to
month, year to year basis to
execute.
And we have not been good at
that.
We've seen a couple of policies
published since the early 2000,
and neither of them have come
with an execution strategy that
has been made public, and that
has been clear on these details.
So some of the challenges here
are concern the government
working as a smart customer with
Canadian businesses and foreign
businesses to get this
capability up and running.
You know, we're even seeing
foreign embassies of our allies
being structured differently
these days with capability in
the embassies and capability at
home to speed the delivery of
procurement to to bring in
capability that is knowledgeable
about procurement of the new
general purpose infrastructure
that we're working with.
That's affecting every sector of
society at the moment, even the
most traditional sectors of
society.
So data, AI, cybersecurity,
intellectual property and this
all points to kind of a new
definition of what constitutes a
Canadian company as well.

### 支出意图与工业战略

**主持人**: Philippe, as as we noted, we
are spending a lot, a lot of
money here, and I want to get a
better understanding of how much
of Canada's defence spending is
just for show, whether it's, you
know, to the US president or to
its NATO allies, rather than how
effective it is here or abroad.

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> Well, largely the defence
spending has been skeletal,
really, when you look at the
level of ambition that we've
tried to do over the past 40
years.
So going back to to this idea of
plugging and playing with larger
Allied forces, we've tried to
spend about **1.5% of our GDP**
having just enough, as many
commentators note, to be able to
make important contributions,
but not much more than that.
The domestic impacts have
largely been on foreign
subsidiaries and offsets that we
get from some of our big
purchases, but we've never
really invested heavily in kind
of a Canadian defence industrial
base.
And this is what we're talking
about now.
And why the the figures that are
being floated seem so
astronomical, because you're
trying to undertake something so
much bigger.
But I will say, you know, talk
of reaching 5% of GDP, for
instance, right now, we don't
know if that's just for show.
We don't know if that was meant
to appease the US president, who
really wanted to, to show that
he was putting pressure on the
allies.
You will note that that 5%
figure is pretty far out.
So a lot can change.

Spending is clearly just perhaps
spending is not strategy and we
need more details there.
But I just want to get your take

Is this for show or is this

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> Well, I think it was an
example of a middle power
verbally committing to stumping
up and meeting its its defence
commitments, especially when we
have such a large shared border
with the master of that
narrative who asked NATO allies
to stump up.
And it it's incumbent on the
country to at least meet the the
minimum NATO GDP percentage
spend that it should have been
committed to over the previous
decade.
But now we're looking, of
course, at a a target of 5%.
But I mean, the good news here
is, is that defence can be
treated as a low hanging fruit,
a broader mission to help
modernise, but also help boost
our industrial strategy through
offsets, to help invest in that
critical general purpose
infrastructure that all sectors
are going to work off of.
And we've got a little bit of
leeway for that with the 1.5%
that can be used for defence and
security related expenditure.
So we do have the opportunity to
really turn this into something
that can scale our economy, and
that's what's going to save us
from tapping into other Social
Security budgets in the future
to finance defence, to grow the
pie on the revenue side of our
GDP balance sheet, instead of
using the same pie and cutting
it up into different pieces.

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> Fundamentally you need a
buyer.
If you want Canadian industry to
invest, somebody has to buy what
they're going to make.
And that's been traditionally
lacking in Canada when it comes
to the relationship between the
Canadian government and Canadian
industry.
So for all the talk of
catalysing or anything else, you
can't just deal with the
investment side.
Somebody actually has to buy
what these companies are going
to make.
So we need a clear demand
signals, as they say, from the
government of Canada, a clear
commitment that they're going to
be buying from Canadian
industry.
In the absence of that, I
suspect industry is going to
hesitate.
So what that demand signal is
going to look like is going to
be a key one.
I would also note that if you
really want to have a vibrant
defence industrial base, you
have to be ready to export a lot
of your equipment.
If you look at countries that
have maintained a very strong
defence industrial base, middle
powers in particular, they sell
elsewhere simply because your
domestic market isn't big
enough.
So think of Sweden or France in
particular.
So what's the export strategy?
So those are the two big things
a buyer and buyers elsewhere.

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> And I'm going to look for the
concept of **value add**.
We cannot grow our small to
medium size enterprises in
Canada unless we help them
provide value add for our
domestic economy, but also in
terms of producing the material
that the rest of the world
needs.
So what are going to be the
incentives behind that?
How is procurement and decision
making going to be streamlined
to make the government a very
agile and effective customer?
And what are those strategic
domains in which value add is
going to be supported?
Because that's how you grow an
economy to add value to your raw
materials and basic refined
processes, to become more
sophisticated, to offer a
pro-competition environment, and
to make things that other
markets will buy.
And this will tap into the
diversification strategy of our
markets as well.
At the moment, you can't
diversify markets unless you
diversify products.

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> Well, you only really have
three ways to do it.
You can run more deficits as
this chart shows.
And therefore that means more
debt and more interest over
time.
And a compounding problem.
You can raise taxes, which not a
lot of people would be keen on.
But imagine, for instance, a
government saying that that **GST**
cut way back when has to be
reversed, has to go back up to
7% in order to afford some of
this, or you make the most
difficult decision of all, which
would be to cut social spending
and other areas.
So cuts presumably to the
provinces or other programs.
Already the federal government
is slashing jobs here in Ottawa,
but that's not going to be
anywhere near that $63 billion.
Similarly, you can cut foreign
aid and other things like that,
but that spend is just so
massive that we shouldn't fool
ourselves about the level of
sacrifice required.

mission.
And back to the point I made
about growing the pie.
Instead of cutting the same pie
up into different pieces.
How do we do that quickly?
Well, we try to make sure that
our defence collaboration with
others around the world focuses
on boosting Canadian industry.
But as we've already seen with
the discussions on the purchase
of submarines either from South
Korea partners or from Germany,
it's predicated on a strong
**CUSMA** agreement and stability
with our US neighbours so that
there is access for these
partners into the US market as
well as the Canadian market.
But, you know, getting behind
the production of other
sophisticated manufactured
products that are underpinned by
sophisticated design, like clean
tech, which at the moment
doesn't seem like it's going to
be competing too much with our
southern neighbours and really
incentivising Canadian companies
that own their IP that operate
off a Canadian sovereign cloud,
that that have their whole tech
stack as sovereign, which is
important in crises, times and
for defence and national
security purposes.

<details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> And I'll get your take on
that.
How will Canada pay for
billions?
And do you share that same
concern that Philippe shares
here?
I do share that same concern
as Philippe.
I would go back to the point
that I made about having this
defence focus be part of a

**主持人**: All right.
In the last few minutes, I have
one more question for both of
you, Philippe.
Since Canada has pledged to
spend billions of dollars to
meet NATO commitments, you know,
the question should be asked how
unified is NATO currently and
what is its future?
What do you see?

the question should be asked how

What do you see?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: >> Well, the NATO alliance is
both cohesive and somewhat
fractured at the moment.
Within Europe itself, it's
stronger than it's been in some
time simply because there's an
awareness, acute awareness of
the threat posed by **Russia** and
the need to safeguard and
encourage a **Ukrainian** victory in
that ongoing conflict.
So there is a unity of purpose
and a clear mindedness in NATO
Europe that we haven't seen in a
long time, probably since the
Cold War.
Not all countries, obviously,
Spain is a bit of an outlier,
but just the fact that **Finland** and
**Sweden** joined is is pretty
good indication where it gets
Dicier, as your listeners
probably know, is the
transatlantic part of of that
North Atlantic.
The United States has been
highly critical of NATO allies,
has put quite a bit of pressure
on Denmark when it came to
**Greenland**, almost threatening
invasion.
And that has led a number of
people to say that this alliance
is is really on its last legs.
I wouldn't go that far.
I think it's going to survive in
some way, shape or form, but
it's more a question of how
committed the US is to NATO and
European security going forward.
And that leaves US Canada in a
tough spot because we're not in
Europe.
We're next to the United States.
And our fundamental concern has
to be that North American
relationship rather than that
European one.

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: >> And yeah, I think the
strength of NATO is based on its
ability to deter against the
threats that we are all commonly
facing, some of which North
America's is more exposed than
our European partners.
And when there is instability in
terms of relationships in
alliance and possibly trust
deficits in some areas, nations
start hedging and the strength
of that predictable trust and
coalition unity gets fractured
somewhat in places.
So, you know, it's really
important that we use the
strength that that that Europe
is bringing to the alliance at
the moment, coming together to
rearm, coming together to deter
Russian aggression.
The strength around the unity of
towards Greenland's sovereignty
that we we keep that momentum
building and that dialogue
underpins everything that the
Alliance does, because that
strength is really important now
that the Arctic region has
become such a geostrategic
pathway, that the polar ice melt
in the region makes that those
swaths of territory much more
accessible, much more habitable
and much more navigable.
So, yeah, I think we're not
going to see NATO crumble.
It's going through a bit of an
awkward moment and some
difficult challenges that it has
not faced in its history before,
but the strength of unity we saw
around the issue of Greenland,
around the issue of not using
tariffs for matters of
sovereignty and coercive use of
tariffs, was, was, was a show of
strength and something that
hopefully our US partners are
going to see as important to the
rest of the Alliance in the
future.

**Brendan Sweeney**: >> I'm doing great.
All right, so give us the lay

How many companies across Canada
are already involved in the
defence manufacturing sector?
And how many could transition if
the call is made out.
Based on a directory, a
capability directory that we're
building.
We have right now more than 1200
manufacturers across Canada, and
I think about 640 of them are
located in **Ontario**.
And I mean, it's a really
exciting when we put this all
together and we can just kind of
map it out provincially, map it
out nationally.
There's a lot of great insights
that we're gleaning around who
these companies are, what they
do and what they could do.
Once we learn a bit more about
the defence industrial strategy
and what's going to be asked of.
Them when we talk about the
Ontario, I think a lot of people
were here in Toronto Midtown,
but we're just like **York Region**
just north of us has a pretty
good concentration of a lot of
these companies as well.
Correct?
Yeah.
We found in York Region alone
more than 80 companies that that
kind of validated defence sector
suppliers, plus another 55 or 60
that we kind of ranked as a high
potential to pivot or
transition.
There's also York Region,
absolutely shout out York
region.
But in the city of Toronto
proper, in Peel Region, in
London, in Waterloo and
especially in Ottawa, there are
substantial concentrations of
defence sector suppliers.

And in many cases it is third or

And we have some particular
strengths in landing gear and

In in southern Ontario, if you
go closer to the London area,
you have land systems and you
have a network of suppliers to
**General Dynamics Land Systems Canada**.
And then in Ottawa, in Waterloo
and in parts of York Region, you
have some really, really

And then of course Brampton,
Ontario, **MDA**, which is
manufacturing satellites and
robotics for space applications,

But when we talk about defence,
one of the things that we've had

So I want to have an

are there enough skilled or

We certainly have the capability

There are probably two places
where we'd really want to think
long and hard about investing
in.
If we want to expand our defence
capabilities, a lot of these
companies that are involved in
the defence sector in Ontario
make things out of metal, right?
That means a lot of **machining**
and **welding**.
Those are two very important
skilled trades.
And so that means we're probably
going to need to develop more
machinists and more welders.
And we know for with some
certainty that General Dynamics
and companies that are making
land systems, vehicles, they're
going to need welders.
Okay.
At the same time, we probably
need to train more **electrical engineers**
if we want to support an
electronic products
manufacturing industry.
We used to have a much larger
electronics industry in Ontario.
And you think **Nortel**, you think
**BlackBerry**.
And we still have some, but it's
very specialised niche
capabilities, many of which are

I'm going to do a little bit of

I know this is your background

They used to play a key role in
defence production because you
could retool say to build tanks.
For example, if you go back to a

Can we do that?
Can we pivot as quickly to, you

**Brendan Sweeney**: >> Maybe.
Probably not.
This is probably a longer
process of transition, and it
might not even need to be
transition.
It might be two things happening
at once.
We're going to support the
automotive industry, and we're
going to sustain and grow the
automotive industry.
And then we're going to support
incumbent defence sector
manufacturers, and we're going
to grow that to.
There is some relationship
between the automotive industry
and the defence sector, but it
tends to be at lower tiers in
the supply chain.
So it's not necessarily the
Magnas of the world or the
Multimatic of the world that are
really clamouring to get into
the defence sector.
It is third and fourth tier
suppliers who for the most part
are not recognisable as
automotive parts suppliers, but
they supply the automotive
industry, they supply the
defence sector, they might even
supply aerospace where there's
some very, very strong linkages
between defence and
manufacturing is in the
aerospace sector.
Virtually every aerospace
manufacturer in Ontario is
doing, has done or is capable of
doing defence sector work.
They're making a landing gear
strut and one day it could go to
**Bombardier** or to **Havilland**, the
next day it could go to
Lockheed.

where we're going to be
directing resources, I.e.
which segments.
You know, we've identified six
core segments of defence: land,
aircraft, marine, space, C4,
ISR, and ordnance.
And so we're going to say, oh,
is this a real aerospace play, a
marine play.
Is it going to be regionalised.
So getting some sense of where
the resources are going to be
directed and what the timeline
is?
Okay, I don't think this is a 1

So the nice thing is it should
give some companies, especially
at lower tiers, time to tool up,
time to time to figure out their
their scaling or their growth
plan or time to transition.

A lot of them, compared to other

small and medium sized
enterprises.
So it really does align nicely
with a lot of economic
development and investment and,
you know, nation building
priorities because we can engage
Canadian companies in this
process.
It's useful to have input from
companies from Japan and Germany
and Sweden, you know, who with

But it's really important to
grow smaller Canadian companies
who many of whom have found
really, really interesting
niches.
