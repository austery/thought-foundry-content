### 访谈开场与嘉宾介绍

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我是《**纽约时报书评**》的编辑**Gilbert Cruz**，这里是书评播客。是这样的，我热爱书籍，希望您听了几期节目后能明白这一点。我也热爱电影，过去几年可能也变得很明显了。这让评论区的一些人感到恼火，但我不会道歉。不过，我还非常非常喜欢电子游戏。作为成年人，我曾经会有些不好意思地小声说出这一点，但现在不会了。我非常自豪自己是一名电子游戏玩家，因为事实确实如此，而且已经持续了相当长一段时间：电子游戏是全球最大的娱乐形式之一。而日本公司**任天堂**就是其中一个原因。**任天堂**是**马力欧**和**路易吉**、**塞尔达**和**林克**、**大金刚**和**宝可梦**的故乡，它是现存最具活力的创意公司之一。我本周的嘉宾将和我们谈论它。《**卫报**》的电子游戏编辑**Kza McDonald**是《**超级任天堂**：解锁玩乐力量的变革性公司》一书的作者。**Kza**，欢迎来到书评播客。

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the New York Times Book Review, and this is the Book Review Podcast. So, here's the thing. I love books, and hopefully that's clear if you've listened to even a few episodes of this show. And I love movies, which well maybe has also become clear over the past few years. To the annoyance of some people in the comments, and to those people, I will not apologize. But I am also really, really into video games. And this is something as an adult that I once would have whispered with slight embarrassment, but no more. No more. I'm a very proud video game player because it's true and it has been true for quite a while now that video games are one of the biggest forms of entertainment in the world. And the Japanese company Nintendo is one of the reasons why. Nintendo, the home of Mario and Luigi, Zelda and Link, Donkey Kong and Pokemon, is one of the most robust creative companies around. And my guest this week is here to talk about it. Kza McDonald, the video games editor at The Guardian, is the author of Super Nintendo, the gamechanging company that unlocked the power of play. Kza, welcome to the Book Review Podcast.

**Kza McDonald**: 您好。非常感谢您的邀请。

**Kza McDonald**: Hello. Thank you so much for having me.

### 电子游戏记者的日常

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您是一名电子游戏作家，一名电子游戏记者。这具体是怎样的？您平时的一天是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You are a video game writer. You're a video game journalist. What does that look like? What does your average day look like?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 嗯，当我第一次成为游戏记者时，我在16岁时得到了第一份游戏杂志的工作，那大约是20年前。那合法吗？您那个年龄可以工作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: Well, when I first became a games journalist, I got my first job on a games magazine when I was 16, which was about 20 years ago. Was that was that legal? Could you work at that age?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 差不多吧。我当然是薪水很低，但我可以工作。我辍学去做了游戏记者，说实话，我父母可能更希望我去马戏团，因为他们能理解马戏团是什么。在很长一段时间里，您提到的这种在更广泛文化中对电子游戏存在的轻微势利眼，是我每天都会遇到的问题。谢天谢地，随着时间的推移，这种情况越来越少了。我写关于电子游戏、制作它们的人以及玩它们的人的文章。所以我的工作是寻找虚拟世界中最有趣的故事。无论是玩家们做出的真正令人着迷的意想不到的事情，还是一个有非常有趣故事要讲述的创作者，又或者只是一款真正有趣且值得关注的游戏。所以我觉得自己是电子游戏世界与更广泛文化之间的大使。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: Just about. I was certainly underpaid, but I could work. I dropped out of school to become a games journalist, which I honestly think my parents might have preferred if I joined the circus because they would have understood what the circus was. And for a long time, this which you mentioned, this slight snobbery around video games from the in the wider culture was something that I encountered day after day. Thankfully, less so as the years went by. But I write so I write about video games, the people who make them, and the people who play them. So my job is searching out the most interesting stories from virtual worlds. Whether that's a really fascinating thing that players are doing that's unexpected or a creator with a really interesting story to tell or just a game that's really interesting and deserves some attention. So I feel like I'm an ambassador from video game world into wider culture.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在《**纽约时报书评**》这样的出版物工作，很多人都认为我整天就是读书。就像我来到办公室，坐下来，然后读书，但实际上我通常不会把时间花在这上面。所有这些都是我在下班后，晚上回家后才做的事情，那才是我的真正阅读时间。我猜您作为一名电子游戏记者，情况也差不多吧。人们会认为，**Kza**肯定整天都坐在电子游戏机前。真是份好工作啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Working at a book publication at the New York Times Book Review, a lot of people assume that what I do all day is just read books. Like I come into the office and I sit down and I read books and that's actually not what I usually do with my time. All of that is stuff that I do after hours essentially when I go home it's night time. That's my actual reading time. I assume it's much the same for you as a video game journalist. People assume, oh well, Kza must just sit in front of a video game console all day. What a job.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 这就是电子游戏记者和**Twitch**主播的区别吧。不幸的是，我很少有时间在工作时间玩游戏。当然有一些，但没有您想象的那么多。我花了很多时间与人交谈，就像任何记者一样。但同时，如果您想成为一名优秀的艺术评论家，那么您必须对自己的主题了如指掌，对吧？所以，我仍然玩很多电子游戏。在我成年后，我从未停止过对它们的热爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: That's the difference between being a video games journalist and a Twitch streamer. I guess very little of my time, unfortunately, is spent playing games on the clock. Some, definitely some, but not as much as you might expect. I spend a lot of time talking to people like any journalist. But also, if you're going to be a good arts critic, then you have to know your subject inside out, right? So, I do still play a lot of video games. I've never fallen out of love with them over my adulthood.

</details>

### 任天堂的独特魅力

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在所有您可以撰写的游戏公司中，您选择了**任天堂**。**任天堂**是现存最悠久、仍在运营的电子游戏公司之一。它与所有竞争对手，比如**世嘉**、**PlayStation**、**索尼**和**微软**，有什么不同之处？为什么它在过去四五十年来对我们的文化有如此大的吸引力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Now, of all the game companies that you could have written about, you chose Nintendo. Nintendo is one of the longest standing, still existent video game companies. What distinguishes it from all of its competitors, from all of the the Seas and the PlayStations and the Sony's and the Microsofts? Why has it had such a pull on our culture for 40 45 years now?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我想写一本关于**任天堂**的书，有几个原因。部分原因是我长期以来一直在报道这家公司，而且是这家公司让我爱上了电子游戏。我爱上的第一款游戏是《**塞尔达传说：众神的三角力量**》。那是我第一次觉得一个游戏世界像我小时候读的那些书一样丰富，像《**纳尼亚传奇**》或任何其他我小时候痴迷的奇幻故事一样。所以，因为**任天堂**让我爱上了游戏，我知道这也是数百万其他人都有过的故事。在我开始推销这本书之前不久，我还生了自己的孩子，他们现在正在发现**任天堂**，我开始通过他们的眼睛看**任天堂**，并将其视为一种跨代的文化遗产，就像**迪士尼**或那些经典的儿童小说一样。所以，我认为**任天堂**对我来说是最有趣的话题，我不会写到一半就感到厌倦，而且**任天堂**也掌握着理解我们为何热爱整个电子游戏的关键。因为如果您了解**任天堂**，那么您就了解了人们为何热爱游戏。它从19世纪末，也就是1889年就开始存在了。**任天堂**最初是日本京都一家制作**花札**纸牌的纸牌公司。在进入电子游戏领域之前，它还制作了各种其他棋盘游戏、纸牌游戏和玩具。所以，它有着非常悠久的历史。**任天堂**的独特之处在于，它从未真正热衷于追逐其他电子游戏公司所追求的相同技术前沿。它始终专注于乐趣、创造力和创新。它的所有想法并非都成功了。但那些真正成功的，我们都知道的，比如**Game Boy**和**Switch**，**马力欧**、**塞尔达**，它们都非常成功，以至于不仅成为日本文化的一部分，也成为全世界文化的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: There's a couple of reasons I wanted to write a book about Nintendo specifically. Partly because I've been covering the company for a long time and it was the company that got me into video games. The first game I ever loved was The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. And so that was the first game that it felt like a world as rich as the books that I read when I was little as Narnia or any of the other fantasy that I was I was obsessed with as a kid. And so because Nintendo got me into games, I know that's the same story that millions of other people have had as well. And another thing that happened to me shortly before I started pitching this book is that I had children of my own and they I'm are now discovering Nintendo and I'm starting to see Nintendo through their eyes and see this as an intergenerational piece of culture, you know, in the same ways as Disney or indeed some of those classic children's novels. So, I thought that Nintendo would be the most interesting topic for for me and that I wouldn't get bored of writing it halfway through, but that also Nintendo holds the key to understanding why we love video games as a whole. Because if you understand Nintendo, then you do understand why it is that that people love games. It's been around for since the late 1800s, 1889. Nintendo started life as a playing card company that made Hanafuda cards in Kyoto in Japan. And before it got into video games, it made all sorts of other board and card games and toys. So, it's got a very long history. And something that distinguishes Nintendo is that it has never really been interested in chasing the same technological cutting edge as other video game companies. It's always really focused on fun and creativity and innovation. And not all of its ideas have been successful. But the ones that have been really successful, the ones we all know about like the Game Boy and the Switch, Mario, Zelda, those have been so successful that they've become a part not just of Japanese culture, but culture all over the world.

### 游戏文化的深远影响

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您会如何描述它的文化影响力？因为我们在这里谈论**任天堂**。这显然是您天生就理解的东西。您写了一本书来谈论它。我觉得我四十多岁了。我的一生都与**任天堂**的成长和扩张息息相关。它的一些角色是全球任何特许经营或媒体中最知名的角色之一。但在某种程度上，当您向某些受众谈论这类事情时，仍然需要过度解释它为什么重要。它的文化影响力是什么？您现在穿着一件**宝可梦**T恤。我们的听众现在看不到。**宝可梦**是现代最大的特许经营之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: How would you describe its cultural impact? Because we're here, we're talking about Nintendo. It's a thing that you obviously inherently understand. You wrote a book about it. I feel like I'm in my mid-40s. My entire life has been shaped and parallel to the growth and expansion of Nintendo. Some of its characters are among the most known characters in any franchise or medium around the world. And it still feels in some way that when you're talking about something like this to certain audiences, you still have to really overexlain why it's important. What has been the cultural impact? You're wearing a t-shirt. Our listeners cannot see this now. You're wearing a Pokemon t-shirt. Pokemon is one of the biggest franchises of the modern age.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我认为它是现代最大的特许经营。**宝可梦**。我认为就纯收入而言，它比任何东西都赚得更多，包括**漫威**或**星球大战**。我认为，如果您可能在90年代电子游戏真正兴起之前长大，那么在很长一段时间里，电子游戏可能一直被视为一种小众活动。但现在发生了一件事，那就是伴随游戏长大的千禧一代，我们已经“掌权”了。所以电子游戏……是的，好吧，反正就是剩下的权力。所以我确实认为人们对游戏重要性有了更普遍的理解，而**任天堂**的文化影响力在某些方面就是整个电子游戏的文化影响力。因为从1970年代末开始的**任天堂**的故事，就是整个游戏的故事。**任天堂**在电子游戏领域取得的许多创意突破，都是推动整个行业向前发展的突破。所以，当我们谈论**任天堂**的文化影响力时，我们不仅仅是在谈论**任天堂**自己的游戏。我们谈论的是那些真正重要的游戏，比如**超级马力欧**和**塞尔达**，以及许多其他我可能会滔滔不绝地讲很多但会省去您一份长长的清单的游戏，它们对玩过它们的人产生了影响，这些人后来又去创作自己的电子游戏、电影和其他媒体。我认为我们看到电子游戏日益增长的影响力，就像……我会说，它确实是21世纪的标志性文化媒体。您提到小时候，像许多有创意的孩子一样，可能喜欢奇幻书籍或《**纳尼亚传奇**》之类的东西。我想知道您是否能告诉我，更详细地阐述一下您在那些书中发现的创意世界，以及那些早期的**任天堂**游戏是如何让您跨越到关心这种现在定义您生活的其他媒介的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: I think it's the biggest franchise of the modern age. Pokémon. I think it's made I think in terms of sheer revenue, I think it's made more money than anything, including Marvel or Star Wars. I think something that if you maybe grew up slightly before the rise, the real kind of rise of video games in the '90s, then it may have seemed like video games were the niche activity for a long time. But there is this thing has happened where the millennial generation that grew up with games, we've aged into power as it were. And so video games Yeah. well, the power that was left anyway. And so I do think there's a bit more of a sort of general understanding of the importance of games and Nintendo's cultural impact in some ways is the cultural impact of video games as a whole. Because the story of Nintendo from the late 1970s onwards is the story of games as a whole. And a great many of the breakthroughs that Nintendo has made creatively in video games are breakthroughs that then drove the whole industry forward. So, when we talk about Nintendo's cultural impact, we're not just talking about Nintendo's own games. We're talking about the influence that those really crucial games, things like Super Mario and Zelda and lots of others that I could get really nerdy about, but I'll spare you a big list. We're talking about the impact that those had on the people who played them and then went on to create their own video games, films, other media. And I think that we see the growing impact of video games as like uh I would say the really the defining cultural media of the 21st century. You referenced being a child and like many creative children perhaps being into fantasy books or the Chronicles of Narnia, stuff like that. I'm wondering if you could tell me, unpack a little more the connection between the creative worlds that you were able to find in books like that and what it was about those early Nintendo games that allowed you to make the leap into caring about this other medium that now defines your life.

### 游戏与想象力的连接

**Kza McDonald**: 在童年时期，现实与非现实之间的界限感觉非常模糊。我知道我小时候是这样，对于许多有创意、有想象力的孩子来说也是如此，我想对于大多数孩子来说都是这样。但我小时候读的书，以及别人读给我听的书，尤其是奇幻类的，比如《**纳尼亚传奇**》、**伊妮德·布莱顿**的小说《**遥远的树**》，我记得我非常喜欢，一遍又一遍地重读。我可以在自己的脑海中体验那些故事。那是我进入文学世界的方式。那就是阅读的魔力。但当我七八岁开始接触电子游戏时，不同之处在于，我不仅可以在脑海中体验它们，我还可以真正在屏幕上做一些事情。比如我可以想，如果我能做那个多酷啊？然后我就可以尝试，而且通常会成功。所以像**塞尔达**这样的游戏是第一个吸引我的游戏，因为它有一个真正回应您天生好奇心的世界。所以您会想，如果您在一个墓地里，您会想，如果我推开一些墓碑会怎样？我想知道下面有没有什么东西，然后真的会有。您推开一个墓碑，其中一个会移动，然后会出现一个楼梯，那就是那种发现和敬畏的感觉。所以我会玩游戏，然后我也会在脑海中继续玩它们，它们会活在我的想象中。然后我会把我思考过的事情和产生的想法带回到游戏中，然后能够执行它们，并以这种方式进行实验和玩耍。这在锻炼我的想象力方面完全是另一个层次。游戏对我小时候做的所有其他事情来说，都处于一个非常不同的层次。我读了很多书，现在仍然如此，但我小时候读了很多书。但我从未看过那么多电视，也从未那么喜欢电影，因为我有游戏和书籍，它们感觉最符合我的思维方式。而且我也很幸运，在一个电子游戏非常有趣的时代长大，因为它们每年都在变化。每六个月就会有一些新的技术突破，一些前所未有的东西。因为我小时候有**任天堂**的游戏机，我经常会看到这些发生。我会提前几个月在杂志上读到它们，然后我会走进像《**超级马力欧64**》这样的游戏，第一次能够在一个3D空间中移动角色。所以，在90年代末和2000年代初玩游戏，感觉真的很有活力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: There is this time in childhood where the walls and the boundaries between what's real and what isn't feel very porous. I know this is true for me as a kid. It's true for a lot of creative, imaginative children, for most children, I think. But the books that I read when I was young, the books that were read to me, particularly fantasy things like The Chronicles of Narnia, Ena Blightton's novels, The Far Away Tree, I remember being really into and rereading over and over again. I could live those stories in my own head. And that was the way into literature for me. That's the magic of reading. But then the difference when I started getting into video games when I was about seven or eight, the difference then was that not only could I live it inside my head, I could actually do things on the screen. Like I could think, wouldn't it be cool if I could do that? and then I could try it and then it would often work. So something like Zelda was the first game that captured me because it had a world that really responded to your natural curiosity. So you would think you'd be in a graveyard and you'd think, I wonder if I push some of these gravestones around. I wonder if there's anything under there and then there would be. You'd push one grave and one of them would move and there'd be a staircase and it was that sense of discovery and awe. And so I would play games and then I would also keep playing them in my head and they would live there in my imagination. And then I would take things that I'd thought about and ideas that I'd had back into the game and be able to then execute them and experiment and play with them that way. And that was just on a completely different level in terms of being able to exercise my imagination. Games were on a very different level to everything else I was doing as a child. And I read very I still do read voraciously, but I read a lot as a kid. But I never watched that much TV and I never got that into film because I had games and books and they felt like the things that align most closely with with my way of thinking. And also I was quite lucky to have grown up at a time when video games were very interesting because they were changing every single year. Every six months there'd be some new technological breakthrough, something that nobody had ever seen before. And because I had Nintendo consoles when I was a child, I would often see those happening. I would read about them in the magazine for months and then I would walk out into a game like Super Mario 64 and be able to move a character around in a 3D space for the first time. And so it felt really energizing to be into games in the late '9s and 2000s.

### 任天堂的“玩乐”哲学

**Gilbert Cruz**: **Kza**，您在书中提出的论点之一是，**任天堂**之所以能成功、繁荣并成为文化支柱，是因为它真正专注于“乐趣和玩乐”这个理念。我对此很好奇，因为理论上，许多电子游戏公司都致力于“乐趣或玩乐”的理念。那么，**任天堂**处理这些理念的方式具体有什么独特之处，使其区别于现在其他所有游戏公司呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So Kza, one of the arguments that you make in your book is that Nintendo is a company that has succeeded and thrived and become such a cultural mainstay because it really has focused on on on this idea of fun and play. And I was curious about that because hypothetically many video game companies are devoted to the idea of fun or play. What is it specifically about how Nintendo approaches these ideas that distinguishes them from anyone else making games right now?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我确实认为今天很多电子游戏公司，特别是将“玩乐和乐趣”视为盈利途径，对吧？就像玩乐的生意，乐趣的生意，是**任天堂**正在追求的东西。不过，别误会我的意思，**任天堂**是一家非常盈利的公司，而且**任天堂**显然拥有卓越的商业本能，但您确实会觉得，也许乐趣是第一位的。我相信这一点的原因之一是，多年来我花了很多时间与在**任天堂**工作的人交谈，也阅读了几乎所有关于**任天堂**历史和在那里工作的人的资料。我确实认为，**任天堂**及其游戏有一种玩乐的态度和激发快乐的态度，这确实是第一位的。显然，这些理念确实带来了巨大的盈利游戏和特许经营。但您现在在**任天堂**游戏中找不到的是，其他电子游戏中常见的那种“参与度挖掘”和“利润挖掘”技术。比如**开箱**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: I do think a lot of video game companies today specifically play and fun it's a route to profit, right? like the business of play, the business of fun is the thing that is being pursued with Nintendo. Although, don't get me wrong, Nintendo is a very profitable company and Nintendo clearly has excellent business instincts, you do get the impression that perhaps the fun comes first. And one of the reasons I believe that is because I've spent an awful lot of time talking to people who work at Nintendo over the years and also reading pretty much everything that there is to read about Nintendo's history and the people that work there. And I do think there's a certain attitude of playfulness and an attitude of wishing to inspire joy that really comes first for Nintendo and its games. And obviously these ideas do result in immensely profitable games and franchises. But what you don't find in Nintendo games now is the same kind of engagement mining and profit mining techniques that you do see in other video games. Things like loot boxes.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 请为那些可能不知道**开箱**是什么的人解释一下。公司是如何激励人们反复花钱玩游戏的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Say what those are for people who may not know what a loot box is. How companies are incentivizing spending money over and over again to play.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 所以，很多其他游戏公司，尤其是现在，他们正在使用“参与度技术”，对吧，就像社交媒体网站或赌博一样。他们使用像“随机奖励”这样的技术，比如时不时地花一点钱来解锁新东西。他们会通过新的每日、每周、每月奖励来激励您返回游戏。所有这些都是为了让玩家被困在游戏的生态系统中。**任天堂**的游戏，尽管它非常盈利，但**任天堂**并没有追求相同的商业理念。它没有追求“挖掘参与度”的理念。它没有试图让您被锁定在游戏中，反复地在上面花费无限的金钱。它仍然以预付价格出售游戏，然后您可以随心所欲地玩。我认为对我来说，这支持了我的一种感觉，即**任天堂**在游戏的“可敬性”和“可爱性”以及其角色方面，采取了一种真正**长期的方法**，而不是追求短期内能带来最大利润的东西，而是追求能让玩家感到良好，让人们对玩游戏和总体玩游戏感到良好的东西。这似乎在**任天堂**的游戏中真正闪耀，我认为可能比大多数其他游戏更甚，尤其是现在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: So, a lot of other game companies, especially now, they're using engagement techniques, right, like social media sites or gambling. They're using techniques like randomized rewards, like paying little bits of money every now and then uh to unlock new things. They incentivize you to return to the game with new daily, weekly, monthly rewards. All of this is stuff that's designed to keep players entrapped in a game's ecosystem. Nintendo games, despite the fact that, is very profitable. Nintendo isn't pursuing that same that same business idea. It's not pursuing the idea of farming for engagement. It's not trying to keep you locked into a game, spending infinite money on it over and over again. It's still selling games for an upfront price that you can then play as much as you like forever. And I think that for me it backs up this feeling that I get that Nintendo has a really long-term approach in terms of its the sort of respectability and lovability of its games and its characters and instead of the pursuit of whatever will make the most short-term profit, the pursuit of what will leave players with a good feeling and what will make people feel good about playing the game and playing games in general. That does seem to really shine through in Nintendo's games. I think perhaps more so than than most others, especially now.

</details>

### 任天堂的神秘与宫本茂

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您谈到作为一名记者，在撰写这本书的同时，还要应对**任天堂**这家极其神秘的公司。所以它有很棒的角色，非常丰富多彩，超级有趣，但也极其神秘。当涉及到向记者或粉丝发布信息时，很多时候很难真正了解内部运作方式。您认为这种神秘感的来源是什么？我们会把我们所做的一切都围起来，直到我们准备好并且能够告诉您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You talk about being a journalist and having to navigate writing this book while also dealing with the company Nintendo that is incredibly secretive. So amazing characters, very colorful, super fun, but also incredibly secretive. When it comes to releasing information to journalists or fans, it's just hard to get any real understanding many times of how things operate within here. What do you think is the source of that? We'll put walls around everything we do until we're ready and able to tell you.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我觉得**任天堂**有点像**威利·旺卡**的巧克力工厂。没有人被允许进入。里面显然发生着令人惊叹的事情，但没有人被允许确切地知道发生了什么。这家公司一直都有这种神秘感。在80年代末90年代初有几年，几家电视台的摄制组进入了**任天堂**总部并参观了一下，但从那以后，除了在那里工作的人，真的很少有人进入过**任天堂**总部。所以，这也是我写这本书的原因之一，因为如果不了解游戏是如何制作的以及是谁制作的，就很难讲述这些游戏为何如此重要的故事。而这些信息是**任天堂**永远不会自己透露的。**任天堂**几年前在京都南部开设了一个自己的历史博物馆。在那个博物馆里，您可以看到所有**任天堂**的游戏、游戏机和产品的展示。但您在任何地方都找不到制作它们的人的名字，甚至在游戏的制作人员名单中，您会看到一长串名字，但您并不能真正了解他们做了什么，他们是如何做的，以及这些想法来自哪里。这才是让我感兴趣的东西。我认为这就是我希望在书中讲述的故事：这些东西是从哪里来的？它是一个难以想象的奇妙梦想工厂，还是一个像其他任何公司一样的企业？他们是如何创造出能够引起共鸣、持续数十年并销售数十年的游戏的？这家公司是如何做到的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: I feel like Nintendo comes across a bit like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Like nobody's allowed inside. There's amazing things happening in there clearly, but nobody is allowed to know exactly what's going on. And there is this secretiveness to the company that has really always been a feature. There were a few brief years in the late 80s, early 90s where a couple of TV crews got into Nintendo's headquarters and had a look around, but since then really very few people have been inside Nintendo's headquarters at all, unless they work there. And so it it is one of the reasons I wanted to write this book is that it's difficult to tell the story of why games are why these games are so important without looking at how they were made and who made them. And that's information that Nintendo will never really give out itself. Nintendo opened a museum of its own history in southern Kyoto a couple of years ago. And in that museum, you have all these displays of Nintendo's games and consoles and products. But nowhere will you find a name of somebody who made that or even in the credits of the games, you'll have a huge list of names, but you don't really get an insight into what they did, how they did it, where the ideas came from. That's the stuff that interests me. And I think that's the story that I wanted to tell in the book is where did these things come from? And is it this unimaginably wonderful dream factory or is this a business like any other? And how do they come up with games that resonate and that last for decades and that sell for decades? How does this company do it?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 如果这是**威利·旺卡**的工厂，那么**威利·旺卡**是谁？这家公司有这样一个人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: If this is Willy Wonka's factory, who is Willy Wonka? Is there such a person at this company?

**Kza McDonald**: 如果**任天堂**像**威利·旺卡**的巧克力工厂，那么**威利·旺卡**本人可能就是**宫本茂**，他是**任天堂**最著名的创意人才。他就是**马力欧**和**塞尔达**的负责人，这两个都是**任天堂**运营时间最长的系列游戏，最近都迎来了40周年。**宫本茂**在1970年代末被聘为产品设计师。他想成为一名漫画艺术家。所以他不是程序员或技术人员，而是艺术人员。因此，他对游戏的思考方式非常不同。结果就是《**大金刚**》，许多人会非常怀念80年代初街机时代的游戏。那是第一批有点故事的游戏之一。它有一个卡通化的外观。它有一种关于您如何进展的故事。有一只大猩猩。它偷走了您的女朋友。去把她找回来。即使那样，也比当时大多数游戏的故事更多。**宫本茂**几十年来一直是**任天堂**的创意北极星。他现在已经70多岁了。他不再直接参与游戏开发，但直到最近他都还在。如果您想让您的想法在**任天堂**变成一款成品游戏，您就必须通过他的审核。您必须通过**宫本茂**的判断考验。所以，尽管现在的电子游戏是由数百人制作的，但在**任天堂**，确实有几位非常资深的创意人物，他们拥有像小说中**威利·旺卡**那样的影响力。

**Kza McDonald**: If Nintendo were like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, then Willy Wonka himself would probably be Shigaru Miamoto, who is Nintendo's most famous creative mind. And he is the person responsible for Mario and the person responsible for Zelda, two of Nintendo's longest running franchises. Both of them turned 40 recently. And Mimosa was hired late in the 1970s as a product designer. And he wanted to be a comic book artist. So instead of a programmer or a tech guy, a computer guy, he was a an art guy. And as a result, he had a very different way of thinking about games. And the result of that was Donkey Kong, a game that many people will remember very fondly from the arcade days, the early ' 80s. And that was one of the first games that had a bit of a story. It had a cartoonish look. It had a kind of story to how you progress. There's a big ape. He's stolen your girlfriend. Go get her. Even that was more stories than most games had at that time. And Miiamoto has remained Nintendo's creative north star for many decades now. He's now in his 70s. And he's no longer directly involved in game development, but he was until really quite recently. And he was the person that you had to get your idea past at Nintendo if you wanted to see it become a finished game. You had to run the gauntlet of Shagaru Miamoto's judgment. So although video games are made by hundreds of people these days, there are at Nintendo a few really senior creative figures who've had the source of influence that someone like Willy Wonka had in in the novel.

### 游戏开发：艺术与工程的结合

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您能稍微描述一下您是如何理解**任天堂**电子游戏的创作过程的吗？因为我们这是一个书籍播客。您是一位作者，一个独立撰写一本书的人。您想想电视或电影，显然有数百人在制作一部作品，有导演，有编剧，有一些人是创意主导者。那么，当涉及到电子游戏时，它是如何运作的呢？谁是创意主导者？您如何让这数百人，有时甚至是数千人（如果您看一些大型游戏的制作人员名单）聚集在一起？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Can you describe a little bit how you understand the creation of uh let's say a Nintendo video game to occur, right? Cuz we're on a books podcast. You're an author, a single person who wrote a book. You think about television or movies and obviously you have hundreds of people who are working on a production, there is a director, there is a writer, there are certain people who sort of like the creative load stars. How does it work when it comes to a video game? Who are the creative load stars? How do you get all these hundreds and sometimes thousands if you look at the credits on some of these bigger games of people to come together?

**Kza McDonald**: **纽约大学游戏中心**的**Frank Lantz**有一句很棒的话，大致概括是：电子游戏需要表演一部歌剧所需的所有创意艺术，以及建造一座桥梁所需的所有技术诀窍。所以电子游戏就像是用歌剧建造的桥梁。我喜欢这句话，因为它真正传达了创造一款游戏的纯粹奇迹般的难度。您有像我这样的作家，他们的工作是为世界、角色和对话增添质感。您有程序员，他们真正构建了游戏，并决定了您与它互动时它的运作方式。您有音乐家。您有艺术家。您有3D艺术家。有如此多的不同学科，如此多的艺术学科和技术学科汇聚在一起，共同制作一款电子游戏。当您花大量时间报道游戏是如何制作的时，您会意识到每一个游戏都是一种奇迹。让所有这些人有效地协同工作，需要如此多的协调，这令人惊叹。这就是为什么现代游戏可能需要5年才能制作完成，并花费数亿美元。这真的很难做到。而在**任天堂**，真正定义其开发过程的其中一件事是，这些团队由长期在那里工作的人组成。所以，在当前的**马力欧**团队中，您会发现**手冢卓志**，他与**宫本茂**一起制作了第一款**马力欧**游戏。他与所有这些最近加入公司的人一起工作，无论是10年前、5年前还是昨天加入的。所以，您拥有关于游戏精神、游戏理念的跨代知识，而且重要的是，还有关于以前的游戏是如何制作的知识。因此，他们似乎能够比其他一些游戏公司更有效地制作游戏，而且用更少的人，这确实证明了他们似乎合作得多么好。这就是它对我来说如此有趣的艺术形式的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: There's a great quote by Frank Lance who runs NYU's game center which roughly paraphrased is that a video game takes all of the creative arts necessary to perform an opera and all of the technical knowhow necessary to build a bridge. So video games are like bridges made of operas. And I love that quote because it really communicates the sheer miraculous difficulty of creating a game. You have writers like me whose job is to give texture to the worlds and the characters and the dialogue. You have coders who literally build the thing and determine how it works when you interact with it. You have musicians. You have artists. You have 3D artists. You have so many different disciplines and so many artistic disciplines and technical disciplines all coming together to make a video game. And when you spend a lot of time covering how games are made, you realize that every single one of them is kind of a miracle. It's amazing how much coordination has to go in to get all these people to work together effectively. And that's why modern games can take 5 years to make and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. It's really hard to do. And at Nintendo, one of the things that really defines their development process is that these teams are made up of people who have been there for a long time. So on the current Mario team, you will find Takash Tesa, who is a person who made the very first Mario game alongside Chigari Mimoto. He's working alongside all of these other people who've joined the company more recently in 10 years ago or 5 years ago or yesterday. And so you have this intergenerational knowledge about the spirits of the game, the ideas of the game, and then also importantly how the previous ones were made. And so they seem able to create games much more efficiently than some other game companies and with fewer people, which uh is really testament to how well they seem to work together. That's what makes it such an interesting art form for me.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我们马上回来。欢迎回来。这里是书评播客。我是**Gilbert Cruz**，本周与我在一起的是《**超级任天堂**》一书的作者**Kza McDonald**，这本书讲述了这家标志性电子游戏公司的历史。长期以来，我认为不幸的是，存在着地下室里孤独玩家的刻板印象，但我现在正在和11岁的儿子一起看《**怪奇物语**》。故事发生在80年代。有很多场景都设定在街机厅里。

**Gilbert Cruz**: We'll be right back. Welcome back. This is the book review podcast. I'm Gilbert Cruz and I'm here this week with Kza McDonald, author of Super Nintendo, which is a history of the iconic video game company. There has been for a very long time, I think unfortunately, the stereotype of the solo gamer in in the basement, but I I'm watching Stranger Things with my 11-year-old son now. It takes place in the 80s. There's a lot of scenes set in arcades

### 游戏的社交本质

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您写的一些东西与我观看时产生了共鸣，那就是您基本上说，许多人第一次接触游戏是在街机厅，或者与兄弟姐妹、朋友、孩子、父母坐在电视机前，电子游戏天生就具有社交性，这与“愤怒的年轻人坐在黑暗的房间里玩电子游戏”的观念截然相反。作为一名电子游戏记者，您如何看待这两种情况，即现实与这种刻板印象如何并存？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: and it something that you wrote resonated with me as I was watching that which was as essentially you say many people's first experience with games was at an arcade or sitting with someone a sibling a friend a child a parent in front of a TV that there always has inherently been something social about video games which runs very counter to this idea of angry young men sitting in a dark room playing video games. I wonder as a video game journalist, how you think about those two, this reality versus this stereotype, how they sit next to each other.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 作为一名游戏作家，长期以来，这一直让我感到非常沮丧，即电子游戏会把您带离现实世界，让您变得孤立。而我作为玩家的亲身经历，以及我反复报道玩游戏的人、与他们见面和交谈时所看到的经验是，游戏是连接的载体。并非所有游戏，但很多游戏都是连接的载体。这始于街机厅，您会和别人一起玩。您会竞争高分，但您也会互相帮助。比如，年龄大一点的青少年会教年龄小一点的孩子玩街机柜的技巧。然后，我认为当游戏进入家庭时，这种传统真的延续了下来，大多数人小时候玩游戏的经历是和父母一起玩，或者和兄弟姐妹一起玩，和室友一起玩。我们有多少人在大学时玩过《**黄金眼007**》？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: This is something that's always been quite frustrating as a games writer for so long is this idea that video games take you away from the real world, that they isolate you. when my lived experience as a player, but also the experience that I see over and over again reporting on the people who play games and meeting them and speaking to them is that games are a vector for connection. Not all games, but a lot of games are a vector for connection. And that started in the arcade where you'd be playing alongside others. You'd be competing to try and win at high scores, but you'd also be helping each other out. Like people, older teenagers would teach younger kids the tricks of the cabinets. And then that tradition really carried on I think when gaming came into the home and most people's experience of games as children was playing with a parent or playing with a sibling playing with roommates. How many of us played Golden 007 in college that these

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 天哪，那么多小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: oh god so many hours

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 很多很多小时，这些都是游戏的决定性体验，这些都是我们记忆中的东西。当您与热爱游戏的人交谈时，当您与他们谈论他们记忆最深的游戏时，通常是那些与某个人有联系的游戏，比如他们和最好的朋友一起玩的游戏，或者他们期待了很长时间并在论坛上谈论了很多的游戏，甚至是他们与不常见面的朋友在线玩的游戏。即使在今天，当很多社交游戏都转移到线上时，在您看来，那个戴着耳机坐在卧室里的14岁孩子可能被隔绝了，被孤立了。但即使那样，那个14岁的孩子也很可能和他的朋友们在一起。他们在聊天。他们正在一个虚拟空间中进行一场共同的冒险，而不是一起在公园里。我认为游戏的这种**社交方面**一直对它们至关重要。而且我认为，玩家之间一直存在着一种**连接感**，尤其是在它是一种稍微小众的追求时。当它在更广泛的文化中受到一些嘲笑时，玩家之间有一种团结感，如果您发现另一个也真正喜欢游戏的人，您就会立刻多了一个朋友。而且，尽管有些游戏是巨大的世界，旨在让您沉浸其中，是**逃避现实的载体**，但我仍然认为大多数电子游戏都是以某种方式追求连接而玩的。我经常在谈论**宝可梦**时提到这一点，因为那是一款没有其他人就无法存在的游戏。您不能在不与其他人收集、交易和战斗的情况下玩**宝可梦**，对吧？否则，如果您自己玩，它就是静止的。很多游戏都是这样。它们真正被您，也就是玩家，以及其他人的体验所激活。当然，您对任何游戏的体验都会与别人的体验不同。这就是它们有趣之处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: many many hours and these are the defining experiences of games these are the things we remember and when you talk to people about who love games when you talk to them about the games that they remember the most is usually the ones that have some they've got an association with a person which it's a game that they played with their best friend or it's a game that they look forward to for a long time and spent a lot of time talking about on a forum even or it's a game that they played online with friends that they don't see very often. And even today when a lot of social gaming has moved online and it might look to you like the 14-year-old who's sitting in his bedroom with his headset on is cut off, is isolated. But even then, it's extremely likely that 14-year-old is with his friends. He's talking. They're having a shared adventure in a space that is virtual rather than being down the park together. And I think that social aspect of games has always been really crucial to them. And there's always been this sense of connection among gamers, I think, especially when it was a slightly more niche pursuit. And when it was slightly more ridiculed in the wider culture, there was a kind of banding together of gamers and if you found someone else who was really into games, it was you'd have an instant friend there. Um, and as much as some games are these huge worlds designed for you to lose yourself in, vectors of escapism, I still think like most video games are played in pursuit of connection in some way. I talk about this a lot in respect to Pokemon because that's a game that doesn't exist without other people. You can't play Pokemon without collecting, trading, and fighting with other people, right? Otherwise, it's inert if you're playing it with yourself. And a lot of games are like that. They're really brought alive by you, the player, but then also by other people's experiences. And of course, your experience with any game is going to be different from some other person's experience. That's what makes them interesting to talk about.

### 疫情对游戏世界的重塑

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我从小玩电子游戏。大学毕业后，我找到了一份工作，然后我把我的电子游戏机都处理掉了，因为我告诉自己，如果家里有这些东西，我真的无法专注于为自己创造生活。很多年过去了，我才再次玩电子游戏。然后2020年来了，我出去买了一台**Switch**，一台**任天堂Switch**，一台**Xbox**和一台**PlayStation**。正是因为疫情这个可怕的事情，我作为成年人重新发现了对电子游戏的热爱。我认为很多人也是如此。正如您在书中写道的，您认为疫情在某种程度上帮助说服了更广泛的世界认识到电子游戏的社会和艺术价值，部分原因是我们都被困在室内，部分原因是因为您写的一款游戏——《**集合啦！动物森友会**》。我想知道您是否能谈谈那个时期，以及您作为一名记者，作为一名经历过很多人长时间待在家中，可能重新接触这种媒介，将其作为与孩子共度时光的方式（就像我与我的孩子一样）的人，您看到了什么。例如，我的孩子玩《**舞力全开**》的时间，我真的相信这导致了他现在对舞蹈的热爱。那个时期对您来说是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So, I grew up playing video games. I graduated from college. I got a job and at some point I got rid of my video game consoles because I said to myself, if I have these in my house, I really am not going to be able to focus on making a life for myself. And many years passed before I ever played video games again. And then 2020 came and I went out and I bought a Switch, a Nintendo Switch, an Xbox, and a PlayStation. And it was because of the pandemic, this terrible thing, that I rediscovered my love of video games as an adult. I think that's true of many others. As you write in your book, you believe that the pandemic sort of helped to persuade the wider world of the social and artistic value of video games, partially because we're all stuck inside, partially because of this one game that you write about, Animal Crossing. Well, I was wondering if you could talk about that time and what you saw as a journalist, as someone who's experiencing a lot of people having to be home for extended periods of time and maybe reconnecting with this medium, finding it as a way to spend time with their children, as I did with mine. The number of hours my child played Just Dance, for example, I I truly believe led to him being into dance right now as we speak. What was that time like for you?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我认为疫情是人们普遍理解游戏的一个真正转折点，因为很多人像您一样，小时候或大学时作为年轻人玩游戏，然后就把它们抛在了脑后，对吧？因为生活会阻碍您。这是一个我经常听到的故事，我相信如果不是我的工作就是跟上游戏的发展，我可能也会遇到这种情况，而且我想我可能也会继续玩游戏，但肯定不会像现在这样，因为它是我工作的一部分。我认为当疫情发生时，我们首先都非常无聊，而电子游戏是进入乐趣的捷径，而且是一种非常好的乐趣，一种有益的乐趣，它不仅仅是分散注意力。我认为在疫情期间，我们都对手机失去了兴趣。没有人想刷新闻，刷社交媒体。所有这些都开始让人感觉不好。人们渴望一些别的东西，一些感觉更有益的东西。而游戏是非常有益的。它们被设计成有益的。我认为，也许如果您过着正常的生活，有很多事情让您忙碌，有很多社交乐趣，您不一定需要游戏提供的乐趣和社交出口。但当所有这些都被剥夺时，突然之间，游戏就成了您获得乐趣和社交的唯一途径。《**集合啦！动物森友会**》于2020年3月发布，它的到来再及时不过了。当时世界上大部分地区都处于封锁状态。我们不允许安全地社交。甚至和朋友出去玩都感觉不安全。这款游戏提供了一种和朋友在一个可以装饰可爱家具的小荒岛上玩耍的方式。我的一些朋友在封锁期间在《**集合啦！动物森友会**》上举办了生日派对。它也是一个创意出口。人们举办喜剧节、脱口秀、艺术展览，都在《**集合啦！动物森友会**》里，因为那是我们做这些事情的唯一安全方式。是的，也许如果所有这些都存在于现实生活中，很多人就不会花那么多时间建造他们的《**集合啦！动物森友会**》岛屿。但我认为它真的展示了游戏如何也能将您从孤独中拯救出来。如果您在生活的某个时期，由于某种原因感到孤独，那么游戏是一个非常棒的社交出口。有很多人由于这样或那样的原因，也许他们正处于疾病或残疾时期，游戏可以成为通往外部世界和与他人联系的真正重要的生命线。我认为疫情向所有人展示了这一点，即使是那些通常忙于玩电子游戏的人，疫情也真正向他们展示了游戏的这一方面，即游戏滋养的方面，这方面可能被稍微忽视了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: I think the pandemic was a real turning point for people's general understanding of games because a lot of people like you, they play games as kids or in college as young adults and then they leave them behind, right? Because life gets in the way. And this is a story I hear a lot and I'm sure it might well have happened to me if it hadn't been literally my job to keep up with games and also I think I probably would have kept playing them but certainly not to the extent that I did because it was part of my work and I think that when the pandemic happened we were all incredibly bored firstly and video games are just such a quick route into fun and like a really good kind of fun a rewarding kind of fun it wasn't just distraction I think we all fell out of love with our phones as Well, a lot during the pandemic. Nobody wanted to be scrolling the news, scrolling social media. That all started to feel bad. And there was a desire for something else, something that felt more rewarding. And games are very rewarding. They're designed to be rewarding. And I think that perhaps if you are living your normal life and you've got lots to keep you occupied and lots of social fun going on, you don't necessarily need the fun and the social outlet that games have to offer. But when you have all of that taken away, suddenly games are your only route into fun and into socializing. Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out in March 2020 and it could not have arrived at a better time. This was the point at which most of the world was in lockdown. We were not allowed to safely socialize. It didn't feel safe to even hang out with your friends. And this game offered a way to hang out with your friends on a little deserted island that you can decorate with cute furniture. Uh, some of my friends had their birthday parties on Animal Crossing during lockdown. It was also a creative outlet. People were holding comedy festivals. People were holding talk shows. People were holding art exhibitions inside Animal Crossing because it was the only safe way for us to do these things. And yeah, perhaps if all of that had existed in real life, many people wouldn't have spent quite so many hours building their Animal Crossing islands. But I think it really showed how games can save you from loneliness as well. If you're in a period of your life where for whatever reason you are kind of lonely, then games are a really amazing social outlet. There are a lot of people who for one reason or another perhaps they're in a period of illness or disability, games can be a really vital lifeline to the outside world and to other people. And I think the pandemic showed everybody, even people who were usually have been too busy to play video games, the pandemic really showed them that aspect of gaming, that nourishing aspect of gaming that perhaps got slightly lost. I think

### 游戏：共同创造的超现实

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我想在您书中的某个地方，您写道：“仔细想想，所有游戏都相当超现实。当我们玩它们时，我们同时生活在两个世界中。”我想我明白您的意思，但您具体是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: at one point in your book, you write, "When you think about it, all games are quite surreal. When we play them, we inhabit two worlds at once." And I think I know what you mean, but what do you mean?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 当我们沉浸在任何事物中时，对吧，读书也是一样，但当我们真正沉浸其中时，感觉就像我们同时坐在真实的物理世界中，但我们又在自己的脑海中创造了另一个世界。对我来说，游戏的魔力在于，您是游戏的**共同创造者**，与为您制作游戏的人一起。开发者制作游戏，将其发布到世界，然后将其转化为艺术的是您与它的互动。我认为这简直是魔法。如果您正在与编程游戏、编写游戏、绘制游戏的人一起创造一些东西，那么您就是在参与创造一种**另类现实**。我只是觉得这太酷了。真的。我记得小时候被游戏的纯粹想象力所震撼，那种孩子般的惊奇感。那是我仍然可以通过游戏获得的感受。不常有，但时不时地，一款游戏会真正触动我，我会觉得有些神奇的事情正在发生。那就是游戏带给我的感觉，没有任何其他艺术形式能做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: When we're immersed in anything, right, it's the same with the book, but when we're really immersed in it, it really feels like we're at once sitting in the real physical world, but we are creating another one in our heads. And the magic of games for me is that you are a co-creator of a game with the people who made it for you. Developers make a game, send it out into the world, and then what turns that into art is you interacting with it. I think that's just magic. If you are creating something alongside the person who programmed the game, wrote the game, drew the game, then you're participating in the creation of a sort of alternate reality. And I just think that's so cool. It really is. It's I remember feeling just stunned by the the sheer imagination of games when I was a child and that feeling that childlike feeling of wonder. That's something that I can still access through games. Not as often, but now and then a game will really hit me like that and I'll feel like something slightly magic is occurring. And that's the feeling that games give me that no other art form does.

### 亲子游戏与屏幕时间管理

**Kza McDonald**: 谈到童年的奇迹，正如我所说，我重新投入电子游戏的原因之一是因为疫情。这在某种程度上是强加给我的。但另一个原因是因为我有了孩子，这是我们能够一起做的事情。在那段时间里，当他的母亲和我在白天工作时，这也能够填补他的时间。但随着他长大，随着我们一起成长，这已经成为一种共同的快乐形式，我们尽可能多地一起玩游戏。您现在作为一名家长，试图找出与孩子分享游戏的最佳方式，最健康的方式，将您从小玩到大的这种媒介传给他们，您的经验是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: Speaking of childhood wonder, as I said, one of the reasons I got reinvested in video games was because of the pandemic. It was somewhat imposed on me. But one of the other reasons was because I had a child and it was something that we were able to do together. It was also something during that time that was able to fill his time while his mother and I were working during the day. But as he has grown and as we have grown together, it has become this sort of shared form of joy and we play games together as much as we can. What has your experience been as a parent now who is trying to figure out the best ways to share games with your children, the healthiest ways to do so, giving them this medium that you grew up with?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 总的来说，与我的孩子们分享游戏是非常有益的。这非常有趣，因为您开始通过他们的眼睛看事物，就像我认为很多人期待第一次能和孩子一起看他们小时候最喜欢的电影一样。您在等待那一年，当他们终于足够大可以看《**星球大战**》、《**七宝奇谋**》或任何其他电影时。对我来说，那就是**宝可梦**。我一直在等我的小孩子足够大可以玩**宝可梦**。不仅仅是看，而是玩，真正投入其中。这在过去几年终于实现了。我们三个人现在都一起玩**宝可梦**。这真是太棒了，因为我作为一个成年人，现在可能不会玩**宝可梦**游戏。它们是非常针对儿童的游戏，我已经玩过很多了。我不需要再花更多时间玩**宝可梦**游戏了。但因为我的孩子们看待它的方式不同，我也以不同的方式看待这款游戏。将游戏作为我们主要的家庭活动而不是个人活动，感觉真的很有滋养作用。能有我们都能享受的东西真是太棒了。我想每个人都知道找到您和您的孩子都能同时享受的东西有多难。我还讽刺地认为，因为我对游戏了如指掌。我实际上是那个总是建议其他父母不要让他们的孩子玩某些东西的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: Sharing games with my kids has been so rewarding overall. It's been so fun because you start to see things through their eyes and in the same way as the that I think a lot of people look forward to the first time they can watch their favorite film as a child with their kids. You're waiting for that year when they're finally old enough to watch Star Wars the Goonies or whatever it was. And for me that was Pokémon. I was waiting for my little kids to be old enough to play Pokémon. Not just watch it, but play it, really engage with it. And that has finally happened in the last few years. and we all, three of us now play Pokemon together. And it's just lovely because I'm I would not play a Pokemon game now as an adult probably. They're games that are very much aimed at kids and I've played loads of them. I don't necessarily need to spend any more time with a Pokémon game. But because my children are seeing it differently, I'm seeing the game differently as well. And keeping games for us as a mostly family activity rather than an individual one, it feels really nourishing. It's really great to have something that that we can all enjoy. I think everybody knows how hard it is to find stuff that your that you can enjoy and your kids can enjoy at the same time. I also think that ironically because I know games inside out. I'm actually the one who's always kind of, you know, advising other parents not to let their kids play certain things.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您听到科技行业的人说，我听过这种说法，他们说：“我知道这东西怎么运作。我不会在孩子18岁之前给他们手机，就因为我知道它有多容易上瘾。”作为一个玩电子游戏长大，并以此为生的人，当您也努力成为一个好家长时，您如何应对这种情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You hear people in the tech industry, I've heard this said, they're like, I know how this works. I will not give my child a phone until they're like 18 years old just cuz I know how addictive it can be. As someone who has grown up with video games and who who writes about them for a living, how do you navigate that when you are trying to also be a good parent?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 我非常支持电子游戏。但电子游戏涵盖了各种各样的事物。一方面，您有**Roblox**，它基本上是由其他人制作的未经审核的内容组成，您懂的，它是一个谁也不知道里面有什么的在线合集。然后您有像**任天堂**这样的游戏，它们非常具有作者性，非常封闭，非常安全。所以这两个极端之间的范围是巨大的。有很多游戏是为成年人设计的，包含成人内容，您绝对不会给孩子看，孩子也不应该玩。还有一些游戏，我个人不信任它们能保障我孩子的福祉。例如，我不会让我的孩子玩任何在线游戏。任何可能让他们与陌生人交谈的情况，对我来说，在这个阶段都是坚决不允许的。但我也认为，我们对“屏幕时间”这个概念有很多恐慌，但并非所有屏幕时间都是平等的。比如，孩子 unsupervised 地看一小时**YouTube**，与孩子花一小时玩**马力欧**，或者和您的孩子一起看一部**皮克斯**电影，与您看一个半小时的**Netflix**上的任何东西，是完全不同的。这实际上是关于找到一种在某种程度上具有**滋养作用的屏幕时间**。所以对我来说，游戏，我确实会限制它，但我不设定严格的限制，因为它真的取决于我们当天的心情。但其他东西，比如**YouTube**和社交媒体，在我的家里都受到非常严格的控制。所以，但我确实理解，如果您自己不玩游戏，很难理解不同类型游戏之间的区别。很难看出像《**堡垒之夜**》和《**使命召唤**》这样的游戏有什么区别。它们都是射击游戏，但一个是面向成年人且相当暴力，另一个则更卡通化，适合12或13岁的孩子。这些事情很难知道。我认为，这也是现在报道电子游戏的人的工作一部分，就是帮助人们了解市面上的各种事物，并帮助他们了解他们的孩子在做什么，以及他们为什么如此热爱它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: I am very pro video games. But video games encompasses a huge variety of things. On the one end, you have Roblox, which is essentially made up of unmodderated stuff that other people have made, you know, and it's a it's an online collection of who knows what. And then you have games like Nintendos which are very authored, very enclosed, very safe. So the spectrum between those two extremes is huge. And there are a lot of games that are for adults that have adult content that you absolutely would not show to a kid that a kid should not be playing. And there are also games that I personally don't trust with my children's welfare. I wouldn't let my kids play anything online, for instance. Anything where there where there's a possibility for them to be talking to strangers is a hard no for me at this stage. But I also think that we have a lot of panic about screen time as a concept, but not all screen time is created equal. Like an hour of a child watching YouTube unsupervised, completely different from a kid spending an hour with Mario or watching a Pixar film together with your children is completely different from, you know, an hour and a half of whatever's on Netflix that day. It's really about finding a version of screen time that is nourishing in some way. So for me, games are I don't I put limits on it, but I don't put strict limits on it because it really depends on how we're feeling on that day. But other things like YouTube and social media are like very strictly controlled in my household. So, but I do understand it's hard to understand the differences between different types of if you're not into them yourself. It can be really hard to see the difference between a game like Fortnite and a game like Call of Duty. They're both shooting games, but one is very adult-oriented and quite violent. The other one is more cartoonish and would be suitable for a 12 or 13 year olds. It's hard to know this stuff. And that's also part of the job these days, I think, of people who cover video games is helping people to understand the broad things that are out there and helping them to understand what their kids are doing and why they love it so much.

### 电子游戏的历史与传承

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我经常思考现代媒体的历史。比如电影史、音乐史以及事物的排名。但只有当您能够接触到这些事物时，才能拥有历史。所以当我在思考电子游戏历史时，您在书中写到了**塞尔达**游戏《**时之笛**》。这是一款1998年的游戏。您说它当时被认为是，甚至现在可能仍然被认为是，有史以来最好的电子游戏之一。我想到两件事，因为我们谈论的是随着时间推移而退化的技术。能够接触旧事物以便体验和评判它们的能力。然后是现在我们拥有的先进技术，当涉及到电子游戏时，它如何能够彻底改变我们看待1998年那种块状3D游戏的方式。所以当一位电子游戏作家、电子游戏评论家说：“这款游戏是有史以来最好的电子游戏之一”时，现代玩家拿起它，玩了之后会说：“这太无聊了，或者我不知道怎么玩。”而您在思考《**公民凯恩**》或**滚石乐队**的专辑或**詹姆斯·乔伊斯**的《**尤利西斯**》时，不一定会遇到这种体验。理论上，您仍然可以像第一次体验它的人那样体验它。您如何看待电子游戏历史以及我们如何评判或不评判伟大？

**Gilbert Cruz**: I think about the history of modern media a lot. So, film history and music history and ranking of things. But you can only have history if you're able to access the things. And so when I'm thinking about video game history, you write about this Zelda game Ocarina of Time. It's a game from 1998. And you say it was considered then and maybe is considered even now to be one of the if not the best video games ever made. And I thought two things because we're talking about technology that degrades over time or whatever. The ability to access old things in order to sort of experience and judge them. And then the way in which the advanced technology that we have now when it comes to video games can radically alter the way in which we see something like a blocky 3D game from 1998. So when a video game writer, video game critic says, "This game is one of the best video games ever made," the modern player picks it up, plays it, and says, "This is so boring, or I don't know how to do this." And you would never necessarily have that experience if you're thinking about Citizen Kain or Rolling Stones album or James Joyce's Ulisses. You can still experience it in the same way hypothetically that people who experience it the first time did. How do you think about video game history and the way in which we judge or don't judge greatness?

**Kza McDonald**: 游戏比其他任何东西都更容易过时。部分原因在于，许多游戏工作室并不真正关心保存他们10年前发布的东西。那是旧闻了，对吧？或者20、30、40、50年前的。**任天堂**确实非常注重保存其旧目录，但它是唯一这样做的公司之一。现在，您有像**电子游戏历史基金会**这样的整个组织，他们致力于收集旧的光盘代码、旧的电子游戏杂志以及所有关于游戏的制作或言论，将所有这些收集起来进行记录，因为游戏工作室在这方面做得太差了。而且技术确实会让老游戏感觉非常过时。如果您现在想欣赏一款90年代末的**Nintendo 64**游戏，现在很难向一个青少年展示它，它的一个模拟摇杆、奇怪的按钮和块状的外观，然后说：“看，这真的很重要。它真的很重要。您必须相信我。我当时就在那里，伙计。这很难。”但是，您知道，现在您可以玩15年前，也就是2010年的游戏，它并没有那么不同。从那时起，技术变革的速度已经趋于平缓。显然，有些东西有所改进。画面更漂亮了，但总的来说，您可以玩大约15年前的游戏，不一定会觉得它很旧。但在此之前，确实存在巨大的入门障碍。我确实想知道，当我们都老了的时候，我们是否会成为那些理解为什么那些游戏很棒的人，也许它们只是不会持续很长时间。但我不确定。我认为人们今天仍然在玩最初的**马力欧**。人们今天仍然愉快地玩着20或25年前的游戏。他们现在仍然热爱它们。我认为您会看到年轻一代对这些老游戏产生欣赏，就像您对老音乐产生欣赏一样。有很多人热爱**披头士乐队**，尽管他们没有生活在1960年代。我认为游戏也会如此，对于那些真正经受住时间考验的游戏。您最近为《**卫报**》（您是其电子游戏编辑）写了一篇文章，是关于玩一款相当困难的游戏《**丝之歌**》的，那是另一款名为《**空洞骑士**》的期待已久的续作。

**Kza McDonald**: Games are more susceptible than anything else to becoming obsolete. Partly because a lot of game studios don't really take much care in preserving the things that they put out 10 years ago. It's old news, right? Or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years ago. Nintendo does take great care with this back catalog, but it's one of the only companies that does. And now you have entire entire organizations like the Video Game History Foundation who are dedicated to collecting old discs full of code and old video game magazines and everything that's been made or said about a game, collecting that all together to document it because game studios are so bad at doing this. And there is also the technology does make older games feel really obsolete. If you are trying to appreciate a Nintendo 64 game now from the late 90s, it's hard to show someone that now, maybe a teenager now with its one analog stick and its weird buttons and its blocky looks and be like, "Look, this was really important. It was really important. You have to trust me. I was there, man. It's it's hard." But, you know, these days you can play a game from 15 years ago, from 2010, and it's not that different. The pace of technological change flattened out since then. Obviously, some things have improved. graphics are prettier, but generally the kind of you can play a game from up to about 15 years ago and not necessarily notice that it's old. But before that, you do have this huge barrier to entry. And I do wonder whether this is going to be something that when we're all old, we will just be the people we will be the people who understood why those games were great and perhaps it's just the case that they won't last a long time. But I I'm not sure. I think that people are still playing the original Mario today. People are still playing games from 20 or 25 years ago today happily. They're still loving them now. And I think that you will see a younger generation who develop an appreciation for these older games in the way that you develop appreciation for older music. There's an awful lot of people who love the Beatles even though they were not alive in the 1960s. And I think the same will be true for games, for the ones that really stand the test of time. You wrote a recent piece for The Guardian, where you're the video games editor, about playing through the quite difficult game Silk Song, which was the long-awaited sequel to another game called Hollow Night.

### 疾病与游戏关系的变化

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您写到被诊断出患有神经疾病，导致手臂和手部剧烈疼痛，而这些是您玩电子游戏所必需的。我想知道您是否仍在处理这个问题，如果是，或者即使在当时，它如何改变了您与这项您热爱并以此为生的事物之间的关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And you wrote about being diagnosed with a nerve condition that resulted in pretty significant pain in your arm and your hand, and these are things that you need in order to play video games. I'm wondering if that's still something that you're having to deal with and if so or even at the time how it changed your relationship to this thing that you love and this thing that you do for a living.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 是的。我基本上是手臂的神经受伤了。所以我的整个右臂在长达六到八个月的时间里都处于非常严重的神经疼痛中。那是非常难以忍受的疼痛，它极大地影响了我的工作和生活。有一段时间，情况非常糟糕，以至于使用右手都会感到疼痛。所以我真的无法玩游戏，当然也无法像以前那样玩。随着我康复好转，我恢复了右手的活动能力。我可以再次玩游戏了，但肯定在好几个月里，我无法以以前的强度玩它们。我真的很喜欢困难的游戏。我喜欢那些给我带来智力挑战的游戏。我也喜欢那些给我带来反应挑战的游戏。这才是让我感到满足的。我倾向于真正投入的游戏是那些具有深度，无论是智力、主题深度，还是在掌握方面具有深度的游戏。所以我不得不开始以非常不同的方式对待游戏。我不得不开始对它们更加放松。我不得不开始每次玩更短的时间。我不得不放慢速度，更加温柔。实际上，在我的工作中，我经常听到很多退休人员的故事，他们在七八十岁时真正培养了游戏爱好，他们发现很多游戏感觉非常苛刻，苛刻到无法玩。所以我真的开始欣赏需要不同气质的游戏，以及不同节奏的游戏，以及游戏会给您提供的让事情变得更容易的选择。它们可能会让您更容易通关而不会一直死亡。或者它们可能会让您更容易控制。它们可能会简化控制。这些对于让尽可能多的人欣赏游戏来说非常重要。而那种“守门员”式的想法，认为“哦，不，您只需要变得更好。您必须足够好。”**Dara Ó Briain**有一个著名的笑话，他说一本书不会在您不理解一个词时自己合上。而游戏有时确实有这种习惯，如果您无法完成某项任务，它就会将您锁定在游戏的其余部分之外。所以，那段残疾和疾病的时期，真的让我重新认识到以更平静的节奏玩游戏的价值，以及游戏提供的**辅助功能选项**。游戏教导您，您只需要不断尝试。您一次又一次地挑战自己。您会变得更好，最终您会成功。而对于疾病，情况往往并非如此。疾病和从疾病中康复很少是意志力的问题。相反，它是关于连接自己，给自己休息，学会比平时更轻松地生活。这就是康复的意义。我学会了游戏可以以不同的方式融入我的生活。那是一段艰难的时期，但游戏最终确实帮助了我很多。

**Kza McDonald**: Yeah. So I I injured the nerve the nerves in my arm basically. So my entire right arm was in really very bad nerve pain for a good kind of six to eight months. It was pretty intolerably bad and it affected my work. It affected my life massively and for a while it was so bad that like using my right hand would hurt. So I couldn't really play games certainly not in the way that I was used to and as I've healed and gotten better I've regained use of my right hand. I can play games again but certainly for a good few months I could not play them with the intensity that I used to. I'm I really like difficult games. I like games that present me with an intellectual challenge. I like games that present me with a reflex challenge as well. That's what gives me the satisfaction. And the games that I tend to get really into are the ones that have a lot of depth, either intellectual thematic depth or depth in terms of how you can master them. And so I had to start approaching games very differently. I had to start being much more chill about them. I had to start playing for shorter periods at a time. I had to be slower, more gentle. I actually hear a lot in my job. I hear from a lot of people who are retired who have really picked up a gaming hobby in their 70s or 80s and who find the this the a lot of games feel very demanding like too demanding to play. So I've really started to appreciate the need for games with different temperaments and four different temperaments and games with different pacing and also the options that games will give you to make things a little bit easier on you. They might make it easier for you to play through without dying all the time. Or they might make it easier to control. They might simplify the controls. This is stuff that's really important for enabling as many people as possible to appreciate games. And this kind of metro gatekeepy idea that oh no, you just got to get good. You got to be good enough. There's a famous Daro Brian joke where it's like a book doesn't close itself in your hands if you don't understand a word. whereas a game does have this habit sometimes of locking you off from the rest of the game if you can't do a certain thing. And so it it really gave me like being having that period of disability and illness gave me a renewed appreciation for a more sedate pace of gaming and also for the accessibility options that games offer. Games teach you that you just have to really keep trying. You just you throw yourself a challenge over and over. You get better and eventually you'll prevail. And with illness that's often not the case. Very rarely is illness and recovery from illness a matter of willpower. Instead, it's a matter of connecting to yourself, giving yourself rest, learning to to take life a little easier than you normally would. That's what recovery is about. And I learned that games can fit into my life in a different way. It was a difficult period to get through, but games certainly helped me a lot in the end.

### 推荐“书籍般”的游戏

**Kza McDonald**: 这是一个书籍播客，所以我必须问，如果听众正在寻找一种“书籍般”的游戏体验，您有什么推荐吗？我将推荐一款很多人在谈论文学电子游戏时都会提到的游戏，那就是《**极乐迪斯科**》，这是一款非常政治化的游戏，讲述了一个醉酒警察试图弄清他昨晚做了什么。从这个前提中，延伸出了一款非常有趣的游戏，它非常关注人类的动机和心理，并且其中有很多非常聪明巧妙的写作和对话。这是一款很多人在这个层面上欣赏的游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: This is a um books podcast and so I I must ask if there are listeners who are looking for a game experience that is sort of booklike if you have any recommendations. I'm going to recommend a game that a lot of people talk about when you talk about literary video games, and that is Disco Allegion, which is a a very a very political game about a drunkard cop trying to figure out what he did last night. And from that premise tumbles out a very a very interesting game that is very concerned with human motivations and psychology and that has a lot of really pretty smart writing and dialogue in it. That's that's a game that a lot of people appreciate on that level.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我还发现，在我玩的许多不同类型的游戏中，我重新发现了对真正叙事驱动游戏的热爱。有《**霍布斯之墓的挖掘**》。您玩过这个吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I also find I have amongst the many different kinds of games I play, I've rediscovered the love of really narrative driven games. There's the excavation of Hobs Barrow. Did you ever play this?

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 哦，是的。是的。那是一款冒险游戏，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's an adventure game, right?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。故事驱动的冒险游戏，感觉它们不是特别繁重。您不需要过分灵巧才能玩，但您会沿着故事线前进，一路创造故事。我喜欢那些游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah. Storydriven adventure games that feel they're not particularly ownorous. You don't have to be overly dextrous in order to play, but you're following a story, creating the story along the way. I love those games.

</details>

**Kza McDonald**: 叙事游戏的伟大之处在于，游戏的目的就是体验故事，您知道，不是为了打败一个Boss，获得高分，等等。它只是为了体验故事。现在有很多这样的游戏，也有很多非常有趣的故事正在被讲述。我最近玩了一款叫做《**派遣**》的游戏，它由《**绝命毒师**》的**亚伦·保尔**主演，讲述了一个不情愿的前超级英雄负责一个超级英雄呼叫中心/调度中心的故事，它以一种非常有趣的方式诠释了这个类型。它比我想象的要聪明得多。我真的很喜欢它。但那是一款您所做的只是观看、聆听、欢笑，偶尔对角色做什么做出选择，然后只是体验故事的游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kza McDonald**: The great thing about narrative games is that the point of the game is to experience the story, you know, is not to beat a boss, get the high score, whatever. It's just to experience the story. And there are a lot of those around these days and a lot of really interesting stories being told. I recently played one called Dispatch, which is it's like it stars Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad Fame, and it's about a kind of reluctant former superhero who's put in charge of a call center, dispatch center for superheroes, and it was it was a very funny take on the genre. It was much cleverer than I thought it was going to be. I really enjoyed it. But that's a game where all you do is watch, listen, laugh, make the occasional choice about what a character does, and just experience the story.
