### 重商主义的回归

**主持人**: 你还记得 2010 年 6 月多伦多街头的情景吗？简直是火光冲天。那是 G20 峰会期间，数千人走上街头抗议全球化，这是当时全球浪潮的一部分。那时，全球化似乎势不可挡。跨国贸易蓬勃发展，经济体紧密相连。但 16 年后，这种确定性已不复存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do you remember back in June of 2010, Toronto streets were on fire? Literally. It was the G20 summit and thousands were marching against globalization as part of a wave of worldwide protests. At the time, globalization seemed unstoppable. Transnational trade was booming and economies were tightly linked. But 16 years later, that certainty is gone.

</details>

**主持人**: 这是 Bridgewater Associates（一家资产管理公司）的首席执行官 **Ray Dalio** 在上个月达沃斯世界经济论坛上的发言。他转向了我们 Bridgewater 内部所说的“现代重商主义”，其核心在于：不再专注于全球化和效率，而是专注于**自给自足**和**国家利益**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Here's Near Beta, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, an asset management firm at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. Turning around to what we call at Bridgewwater modern mercerism, which is instead of being focused on globalization and efficiency, being focused on self-sufficiency, national interest.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，这种转变对加拿大和我们的经济意味着什么？欢迎收看 The Rundown。重商主义听起来可能像历史课上的内容，但贸易战和关税可能正推动它卷土重来。我与多伦多大学政治科学系教授 **Eric Heliner** 以及多伦多大学全球事务与公共政策学院的教授 **Drew Fagan** 进行了对话，以了解我们是否正经历一场现代复兴，以及这可能对全球经济意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, what does this shift mean for Canada and our economy? Welcome to the rundown. Mercantalism might sound like something from a history lesson, but trade wars and tariffs could be pushing it toward a comeback. I sat down with Eric Heliner, professor in the department of political science in the Balsili School of International Affairs at the University of Wateroo, and Drew Fagan, professor at the Monk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto to get insight into whether we're living through a modern revival and what that could mean for the global economy.

### 重商主义的定义与特征

**主持人**: 在我们深入探讨定义之前，先来了解一下我们谈论重商主义时指的是什么。重商主义主导了 17 和 18 世纪欧洲关于国际经济政策的思考。重商主义的根本信念是，国际经济政策主要是**国家权力的工具**。由于权力不像繁荣那样是相对的，重商主义者将国际经济交往视为**零和博弈**——你赢，我输。这是 Martin Wolf 今年早些时候在《金融时报》上的论述。Eric，这准确地描述了重商主义吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Before we get into sort of a definition here, let's get an idea of what we're talking about when we talk about mercantalism. Mercantalism dominated European thinking on international economic policy in the 17th and 18th centuries. Mercantalist underlying belief was that international economic policy is primarily a tool of state power. Since power unlike prosperity is relative, mercantalists think of international economic engagement as zero sum. You win, I lose. That was Martin Wolf in the Financial Times earlier this year. Eric, is this an accurate representation of mercantalism?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 是的。我可能会补充两点。第一，重商主义者相信**权力与财富**是紧密相连的。所以，如果你试图提升你国家的权力，你也在试图提升它的财富，两者之间存在相互依存的关系。第二点，一个人可以相信提升自己国家的权力和财富，同时又支持自由贸易。但在重商主义者那里，他们的政策处方不是自由贸易，而是**保护主义政策**，但要采取**战略性保护主义**。所以，这些人并非相信**自给自足**（autarchy），而是通过保护主义和战略性方式来实现目标，同时让国家在全球经济中保持相对开放。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: It is. I would add maybe two things. One is that mercantalists have a belief that power and wealth are are deeply interconnected. So if you're trying to promote the power of your state, you're also trying to promote its wealth and they there's a reciprocal relationship there. And the other thing I would add is that uh you know you could be someone who believes in promoting the power and wealth of your state but be a free trader. Uh but in the case of mercantalist the policy prescription that they have is not free trade. It's protectionist policies but strategic protectionist policies. So these are not people who believe in autarchy, self-sufficiency, but rather uh using protectionism and strategic ways to achieve objectives while your state remains in a relatively open world economy.

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 而且，他们不仅关注边境上的国家干预，也关注国内经济。比如**补贴**和**国有企业**等。当我们想到重商主义时，很多人会想到最大化出口、最小化进口。你提到了其他一些特征，那关税或殖民主义呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: And if I can just add one additional thing, it's not just at the border that they're interested in state activism or state interventionism. It's also within the economy. So subsidies and stateowned enterprises and all kinds of things like that. When we think of mercantalism, I think a lot of people think about maximizing export, minimizing imports. Uh you mentioned a few other uh traits there, but uh what about um tariffs or colonization we when we when we talk about mercantalism?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 是的。历史上，许多重商主义者确实是帝国主义者，但这并非对所有人都适用。重商主义阵营内部存在巨大的多样性。你可以将重商主义营看作一种思想传统，就像经济自由主义一样。亚当·斯密有很多追随者，重商主义传统中也有类似的思想家。有些人是帝国主义者，但有些人则反对帝国主义。所以，在这方面没有一致性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: Yeah. So certainly historically uh many mercantalists were imperialists as well, but it's not true of all of them. So there's a huge variety in the mercantalist camp. So I mean one way to think about the mercantalist camp is it's like an intellectual tradition like economic liberalism. So Adam Smith has many followers. There's a similar line of thinkers in the mercantalist tradition and some of them were imperialists but others were anti-imperialists. So there's no consistency on that on that issue.

### 全球经济的转变与新重商主义

**Drew Fagan**: Drew，当我们放眼世界，听到各国基于关税制定贸易协定，变得更加自给自足。在你看来，这是否是当前正在发生的全球政治经济转变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: Drew uh when we look around the world we hear of countries making trade deals based on tariffs uh becoming more self-reliant. In your view is this a kind of global political economic shift happening right now?

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 确实存在一种转变。从**特朗普政府**的角度来看，**自由贸易**时期——它确实是二战后**规则体系**的重要组成部分，形成了**世界贸易组织**——是应用了亚当·斯密的“贸易能提升所有船只”的理念。而正如 Eric 所说或你所说的，重商主义本质上是零和的。因此，随着世界贸易组织的影响力日益减弱，世界各地有一系列国家正在应用所谓的“**新重商主义**”原则。你可以看到唐纳德·特朗普对出口和进口的关注，以及他对贸易逆差的担忧。这是这种转变的体现。还有补贴、**国家冠军企业**（national champions）以及政府优先考虑本国利益。这让我们这些经典的自由贸易者处于更大的劣势，因为我们不得不面对更强大的美国，而特朗普政府似乎正朝着这个方向发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: There is a shift going on and from the perspective of the Trump administration the period of free trade which really was part and parcel of the rules-based system after the second world war what became the world trade organization was applying Adam Smith in the sense of trade raised all boats and um and as Eric was saying or you were saying mercantalism is really zero sum. So you've got a whole series of countries around the world as the World Trade Organization becomes less and less powerful that are applying the principles of neo mercantalism if you like. You can see Donald Trump exports and imports and his concern about trade balances. This is a reflection of that. also subsidies, national champions, and governments thinking about their country for themselves. And that puts us, a classic free trader, at an even greater disadvantage up against the much bigger United States, considering that that's where the Trump administration appears to be going.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，在谈论加拿大之前，我想谈谈两个最大的经济体。我们已经谈了美国，现在来谈谈中国。Eric，中国一直是这个新重商主义理念的中心。你能提供一些证据来支持这一点吗？我们看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, before we get to Canada, I want to talk about uh the two biggest economies. We already talked about the US, but let's talk about China. Eric, China has been at at at the center of this neoarantalism idea. Uh can you give us some evidence to sort of support this? What have we seen?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 是的。中国是一个有趣的案例，因为它有着悠久的重商主义或新重商主义思想传统。事实上，19 世纪的中国思想家在推广这一理念时，会追溯到公元前 3 世纪的《商君书》，其中包含了关于权力和财富相互关联的思想。所以，这是中国思想中根深蒂固的传统。**习近平**，中国现任领导人，深受重商主义思想的影响，例如 20 世纪早期的 **Frederick List**（注：原文此处应为人物名，但转写有误，推测为 List 或其他相关学者）。中国的新重商主义版本比美国新重商主义思想（其在美国 19 世纪也有深厚根源）更为**干预主义**。它也历来更具**出口导向**性，这是中国重商主义历史的一个关键特征。所以，它有其独特的特点，但自 1978 年**邓小平**上台以来，中国一直在推行新重商主义政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: Yeah. So the China is an interesting case because it has a long tradition of mercantalist or neoarcantalist thought. In fact, the Chinese thinkers in the 19th century who were promoting this idea, you know, would would reach back into the 3rd century BC to the book of Lord Shang who had ideas about power and wealth being interconnected. So this is a deep tradition in Chinese thought. Xi Jinping in the current era, current leader of China is very informed by mercantalist thought. Figures like Syadsen from earlier in the 20th century. uh and the Chinese version of neo mercantalism is a much more interventionist version than um say the history of American neo mercantalist thought which also has deep roots in the in the 19th century. It's just in a less activist less interventionist uh manner. It's also historically been more much more exportoriented. That's a key feature of the the kind of Chinese history of mercantalism. So it's got its distinctive features but certainly since uh Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 China has been pursuing neoarangentalist policies.

</details>

**主持人**: Drew，我们刚才谈到了美国，特朗普的关税转向保护主义。这是否标志着全面转向重商主义，还是美国在这方面存在混合因素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Drew we tal talked about uh the US here uh Trump's tariffs shift towards protectionism. Does this signal a a full move to mercantalism or is there a mix here when it comes to the US?

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 我们真的不知道。很难预测他会在这条路上走多远，但就目前而言，他肯定没有退缩。如果说有什么变化的话，那就是他在加倍下注。如果我们以与中国关系为例，他担忧中国贸易顺差的规模，其中很大一部分是以进入美国的消费品形式存在的。你知道，长期以来，大家都是消费者，都受益于低价。现在的情况是，特朗普早在十年前就预见到这一点，他更加关注国内经济、工人以及那些在很大程度上已被美国经济剥离的制造业。在经济整体变化中，作为消费者和作为工人的平衡，他仍在某种程度上强调这一点。成功与否取决于他目前关注的是哪些行业。现在很难看到美国制造业真正腾飞，考虑到工资水平，或者像……（此处原话不清晰）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: We don't know really. I mean, it's hard to project predict how far he's going to go down this road, but as of now, he's certainly not pulling back. If anything, he's doubling down. If we think about the relationship with China, for example, the concern he has about the size of the Chinese trade balance, trade surplus, much of that in the form of consumer goods coming to the United States. You know, there's been a long tradition that's changing now in which essentially everybody was a consumer and everybody benefited from low prices. And now we've got a situation in which, and Trump was ahead of this a decade ago, in which much stronger concern about the domestic economy, about workers, about things like manufacturing that have been stripped out to a sizable extent of the US economy. and the balance between being a consumer and being a worker for the economywide changes and he cons continues to emphasize that to some extent it depends the success depends on what sectors he's looking at helping right now it's hard to see manufacturing really taking off in the United States given the size of wages or for something you know cool for example you know

</details>

### 加拿大的处境与应对

**主持人**: 让我们来谈谈加拿大。加拿大和中国达成了一项协议，以减少对**加拿大油菜籽**（canola）和海产品征收的关税，以换取一定数量的**电动汽车**（EVs）。这是否属于重商主义的范畴？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: let's talk Canada uh Canada and China strike a deal uh for reduction in tariffs uh on canola seafood products in exchange for a set number of EVs. Would this fall into a category of mercantalism?

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 在一定程度上是。另外，加拿大与美国的关系存在特殊条件，以及政府希望实现贸易多元化。我们最近几天看到的是，美国希望限制加拿大实现贸易多元化的能力，这对加拿大来说是危险的。首先，我们 75% 的贸易出口都流向美国。中国则大约占 5%。所以，在多元化方面存在挑战。我们尝试了很多次，但都没有成功。我们现在可能看到的是一种新的、可以说是“进攻性重商主义”，即美国试图通过限制或选择加拿大在美国这个大市场和中国等其他市场之间进行选择，来向加拿大施压。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: I in part and in part the special conditions which Canada has in relation to the United States, the government's desire to diversify trade. Um, and what we're seeing in the last few days is the US desire, and this is dangerous for Canada, to limit the ability of Canada to diversify trade. To begin with, 75% of our trade exports to the United States. China is more like 5%. Um, you know, so you got a challenge in terms of diversification. We've tried it many times and haven't been successful. What we may be seeing now is a new offensive mercantalist, I guess you could say, in which the United States, as I was saying, tries to put pressure on Canada by limiting or choosing between the big US market and other markets, in particular, China.

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: Eric，在你看来，加拿大是否正在一个新重商主义体系内运作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: Eric, in your view, I is Canada acting within a neo mercantalist system?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 从广义上讲，任何时候你对进口设置限制，并且其目标是为了最大化你国家的权力和财富，都可以将其归类为新重商主义政策。我认为，在加拿大，我们长期以来都有对美国反对自由贸易的反应。19 世纪中期我们曾有过一项自由贸易协定，但后来被废弃了，我们在 1870 年代末最终转向了“国家政策”（National Policy），这是一项旨在实现贸易多元化、建立国内市场的重商主义战略。但这是一种反应，是对美国转向反对自由贸易的被动回应。在大萧条时期，当美国推出《斯姆特-霍利关税法》（Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act）时，我们也采取了类似行动。你知道，我们迅速转向了英国市场，试图寻找替代方案。1971 年尼克松冲击发生时，我们再次尝试多元化，并试图建立国内市场。所以，在加拿大，这通常是一种被动的战略，是对美国自身背离自由贸易的回应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: I mean, in a general sense, anytime you're putting restrictions on imports, you can classify that as as a new mercantalist policy if the goal is to maximize the power and wealth of your state. Um, I think in the Canadian case, you know, we we have a long history of responding to the United States going against free trade. So we used to have a free trade deal in the mid- 19th century that got abandoned and we turned eventually to the national policy in the late 1870s which was a neomarantalist strategy of trying to diversify trade trying to build up a domestic market and it's a response though it's a reactive response to the US turning against free trade we did the same in the great depression when uh the US introduced a smooth holly tariff act you know we turned very quickly to British markets trying to find an alternative when the Nixon shock happened in 1971 you know once Again, we tried to diversify and we tried to build up national markets. So, it's in the Canadian case, it's generally been uh a reactive strategy in response to America itself turning away from free trade.

</details>

**主持人**: 帮助我们理解一下，今天的贸易协定与过去在自由贸易旗帜下进行的贸易协定有何不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Help us understand a little bit what makes the trade deals of today different from the trade deals that were happening sort of under the banner of free trade.

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 在你可以称之为自由贸易黄金时代的 1990 年代，世界贸易组织成立，那是一系列多边贸易谈判，有点像“一刀切”，世界上的许多国家都参与其中。而我们现在所处的时代，更多的是一系列**双边关系**。我认为美国尤其希望建立一种**中心辐射型**（hub and spoke）的双边关系，它们是中心，从而最大化自身权力。我认为中国也想要同样的东西。你知道，这是一种他们历史上曾有过的“朝贡模式”，即中国与世界各国签订双边协定，并通过这些双边关系来最大化其权力。所以，区别在于那种中心辐射型关系与一个所有参与者都遵守相同规则的多边秩序。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: So in the in the era uh which you can call kind of the high point of free trade 1990s when the World Trade Organization is created you know that's a multilateral set of trade negotiations where it's kind of oneizefits-all and uh many of the countries of the world are involved in that process. What we're in right now is much more of a set of bilateral relationships and I think the United States in particular would like a set of kind of bilateral hub and spoke relationships at which they are the center and that maximizes their power. I think China wants the same thing. You know, it's a it's a kind of tributary model that they had historically where China would make bilateral deals with states around the world and and uh and maximize its power through those bilateral relationships. So it's the difference between that kind of hut and spoke relationship and a more multilateral order in which all all are governed by the same rules.

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: Drew，这个**中心辐射型**关系的一个很好的例子就是北美经济以及**北美自由贸易协定**（NAFTA）的结构，它演变成了现在的**美墨加协定**（USMCA）。在 20 世纪 90 年代初，美国希望只与墨西哥谈判自由贸易协定。我们坚持（这是在双边协定之后）要成为三边协定的一部分。现在，美国提出的关于美墨加协定延续性的一些设想是“双边化”，这会引起与中心辐射型模式相同的担忧。我认为这是美国加大对加拿大施压的一部分，要求我们优先服务于他们，但在他们不让我们轻易做到这一点的情况下。他们希望我们优先服务于他们，但由于他们的权力，他们可以轻易地占据优势。简单来说，我想强调一点。Eric 关于加拿大历史的说法是完全正确的。我们认为自由贸易是我们过去 40 年以及重新 orient（调整方向）向美国靠拢的重要组成部分。在统计数据方面，这种重新 orient 的程度不如现在。但“**国家政策**”（national policy）、关税壁垒、在国内建设制造业，对我们来说，这始终是第二选择。美国基本上给了我们一个二元选择：你可以自由贸易。这可以追溯到 19 世纪。如果你成为他们国家的一部分，如果你不想成为他们国家的一部分，你就得不到自由贸易。我这样说是极度简化了，但其中有很多 truth（真相）。而这种平衡，尤其正如 Eric 所说，在美国自身在全球自由贸易问题上发生变化的情况下，对我们来说总是很难找到。Eric，你想补充吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: Yeah. So the hub and spoke relationship is a good exa the good example in the North American economy and the structure of NAFTA which became KUSMA the existing free trade agreement in the early 1990s. The United States wanted to negotiate a free trade agreement only with Mexico. We insisted and this is after the bilateral agreement of being part of a trilateral agreement. Now the United States, one of the things they've floated with regard to the continuation of the US MCA is dual bilateral which would get at the same concern with regard to hub and spoke. It's part and parcel I think of US putting greater pressure on Canada um to serve them first but in circumstances where they're not making it easy. They want us to serve them first but in circumstances because of their power to take advantage is simply put. You know I want to make a point. Uh Eric was exactly right with Canadian history. We think of free trade as having been part and parcel of you know the last 40 years and the reorientation towards the United States. There was less of a reorientation than this you know in terms of the statistics but the idea of a national policy tariff wall build manufacturing at home for us that was always a second choice. The United States essentially offered us a binary choice. You can have free trade. This goes back to the 19th century. if you become part of the country, if you don't want to become part of the country, you're not going to have free trade. I'm simplifying hugely, but there's a lot of truth to it. And that balance, especially as Eric said, in the context of the United States itself changing with regard to free trade globally, was always tricky for us to find. Eric, did you want to get in there?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 我只是想补充一点，Drew 提出的观点非常有趣。我想强调的是，我们以前经历过这种情况。特朗普的英雄之一是麦金莱（McKinley），他是 19 世纪末的总统。麦金莱以 1890 年的**麦金莱关税**（McKinley tariff）而闻名，该关税旨在向加拿大施压。麦金莱本人并未公开表示，但当时他身边的一些人试图向加拿大施压，迫使其**合并**（annexation）。所以，这是一段悠久的历史，我们必须以过去的方式来应对它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: I was just going to add, it's a really interesting point that Drew is making and and just to highlight that we've been through this before. So, one of Trump's heroes is McKinley, the president from the late uh late 19th century. And McKinley is well known for something called the McKinley tariff in 1890, which did have the objective of pressuring Canada. And McKinley himself didn't say this, but there were people at the time around McKinley who were trying to pressure United pressure Canada into annexation. And so, this is a long history, and we have to react to it in the ways that we have in the past.

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 那么，加拿大在这其中扮演什么角色呢？这确实充满挑战，因为加拿大作为一个西方中等强国，有几个独特的方面。我们**依赖贸易**，而且我们依赖的这个国家（美国）有时会挑战我们，尽管它是我们最好的朋友，但现在情况不同了。在自由贸易和 1988 年大选之后，我们已经习惯了这种环境，而现在全球环境已经改变了。这与总理在达沃斯演讲中的一部分内容有关，我们的挑战在于，我们像许多西方国家一样，依赖贸易。顺便说一句，美国不依赖，因为它的国内市场非常庞大。它们之间的贸易量远超其他任何西方国家。我们则处于较高的一方。但当然，这种依赖是针对一个国家的。而总理现在正试图摆脱这种状况，走向世界各地进行交易。其中最具争议的是中国。我们以前也尝试过，现在也取得了一些进展，但这并不能替代美国这个正在背弃我们的市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: Where does Canada fit in all of this then? It's really challenging because there's a few distinct aspects of Canada as a western middle power. We are trade dependent. We are trade dependent on a country that was always you they can be challenging our best friend and they're not and it's changed suddenly. So we have come after free trade and the election of 1988 to be comfortable with this environment and now the environment globally has changed. It's a little bit of a subset of the prime minister's speech in Davos and part of our challenge is we you know are trade dependent like many western countries. The United States, by the way, isn't because its domestic market is so big. They trade within themselves a lot more than any other western country. We're we're on the higher side. But of course, that dependence is on one country. And what the prime minister now is trying to do is shake this off a little bit and go around the world and do deals. The most controversial being China. And we have tried this before and right now we are making some progress but it's not a substitute for the US market that's turning its back on us.

</details>

**主持人**: Eric，在你看来，这是自由市场、最小政府干预的终结吗？这是**新自由主义**（neoliberalism）的终结吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, Eric, is this the end of sort of, you know, free markets, minimal government, uh, you know, intervention? Is this the end of neoliberalism?

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 目前，我会说是的。但很难知道我们将走向何方。我认为可以这样论证我们所处的情况是：美国正在回归一种在 1945 年前非常普遍的政策。你知道，19 世纪的人们甚至将新重商主义称为“美国政治经济体系”。所以，这是一个根深蒂固的传统。Drew 提到了 Mark Carney 在达沃斯的一次重要演讲。在同一次会议上，美国贸易代表 **Jameson Greer** 的演讲也引用了这段历史，并说：“这是美国的保护主义历史。”因此，如果美国正在回归一种对其而言是历史常态的观点，那么这对全球体系来说是一个巨大的冲击，因为自 1945 年以来，美国一直是推动更开放世界经济的领导者。所以，是的，从这个意义上说。但我认为，更有趣的问题是，这种状况能持续多久？会不会在美国国内出现对特朗普保护主义的**反弹**？因为他所采取的保护主义措施比 19 世纪（特朗普经常引用的那个时代）的措施更为极端。举个例子，我之前提到的 1890 年的麦金莱关税在美国引起了反弹。所以在 1892 年的选举中，你知道，出现了要求自由贸易的推动。所以，这并非板上钉钉，但正如 Drew 所准确描绘的那样，这无疑是一个巨大的冲击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: So, uh, at the moment I would say yes. Uh, but it but it's hard to know where we're going. Um I mean the reason I think to argue that that is the situation we're in is that the US uh is returning to a policy that was very common for them you know before 1945 which was I mean people even referred to neoarcantalism in the 19th century as the American system of political economy. So this is a a deeprooted tradition. Drew made reference to uh Carney's important speech in Davos. The speech that was made at the same meeting by Jameson Greer, the US trade representative, invoked this history and said, you know, this is the American history to be protectionist. And so to the extent that that uh that kind of worldview that the US is returning to something that for them is historically normal is a a massive shock to the global system because the US since 1945 has been the leader of promoting a more open world economy. So yeah in that sense but I think the more interesting question in terms of looking forward is does that last? Yeah. So will there be a backlash within the United States to some of the Trump protectionism because the kind of kinds of protectionism he's done have been much more extreme than uh were even done in in the kind of 19th century era that Trump often invokes. Uh and just to give you one example to finish up here, uh you know, the McKinley tariff that I mentioned earlier of 1890 produced a reaction in the United States. And so in the 1892 elections, you know, there was a push back towards free trade. And so this isn't uh this isn't set in stone, but it's certainly a massive shock in the way that Drew, I think, is accurately depicting.

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 好的。那么，1890 年到 1892 年这段时期，恰好是我们至少到目前为止所说的“合并高峰期”。当时有相当多的选民支持合并，尤其是在边境地区，尽管不是多数。而在那个十年后期，随着西部的发展，加拿大在经济上变得更加自信，这种想法就消失了。如今，多年过去，在加拿大几乎没有支持声音，部分原因在于，你知道，这是唐纳德·特朗普提出的，而且是在我们正在讨论的所有背景下。这是一个非常有趣的时刻。让我举一个例子，说明 Eric 谈到的重商主义的局限性。假设特朗普迫使**苹果公司**（Apple）回国。去年有一本好书《**Apple in China**》，讲述了他们在那里（中国）的战略。如果 iPhone 在美国制造，成本会有多高？如果价格翻倍甚至三倍，消费者的反应会如何？政府在补贴美国消费者方面会有什么反应？他不会费心去补贴加拿大消费者，你知道，这只是一个重要的产品例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: All right. Sure. So that period of 1890 to 1892 coincidentally is what we might call peak annexation at least until now. There were significant um there was significant voter support not majority by any means in border areas for annexation. And in the later part of the decade as the west grew, Canada grew more confident in itself economically that disappeared to come up now many years later with very little support in Canada in part because you know it's being offered by Donald Trump in all the circumstances that we're talking about. It's it's a really interesting moment. Let let me give an example of maybe the limits um that Eric was talking about with regard to mercantalism. Let's say that Trump forced Apple to come home. There's a good book in the last year, Apple in China, right? Great book on, you know, uh, their strategy there. How much would an iPhone cost if it was made in the United States? And what's the consumer reaction if that phone doubles or even triples? And what's the reaction of the government in terms of subsidizing American consumers with regard to that? he's not going to bother with subsidizing Canadian consumers, you know, just as one significant product.

</details>

**主持人**: 过去，正如你所提到的，重商主义导致了一个更加分裂的世界和冲突。我们正走向何方？这次我先请 Eric 开始，然后以 Drew 结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um, in the past and as as you as you mentioned, mercantalism has led to a more fractured world and conflicts. Where are we headed? Um, this time I'll start with Eric and we'll finish with Drew.

</details>

**Eric Heliner**: 快速来说，新重商主义不一定意味着一个充满冲突的世界。一些最著名的重商主义思想家，如 **Frederick List** 或 **Henry Carey**，他们相信国际合作。所以问题是：特朗普所做的是否是一种暂时的战略，以便达成某种新的国际协议？他身边的一些人谈论的是一个“**新布雷顿森林体系**”（New Bretton Woods），或者 Jameson Greer 谈论的是一个新的国际经济体系。还是说特朗普处于一种无休止的交易模式中，永远没有最终结果？如果是后者，那么我们正处于一个更具冲突性的世界；如果是前者，那么我们正处于一个暂时的阶段，试图建立一种需要谈判的新均衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Eric Heliner**: Yeah. So, quickly, neochendalism does not necessarily need to be a conflictual world. So some of the most famous neo mechanicalist thinkers Frederick List or Henry Kerry there's people believed in international cooperation. So the question is uh is Trump doing what he's trying to do as a temporary strategy to then reach some kind of new international agreement uh and so some of the people around him talk about a new Breton Woods or Jameson Greer has been talking about a new international economic system or is Trump in a mode of kind of endless deal making where there's never any final outcome and if it's the second one we're in a much more conflictual world if it's the first one we're in a kind of a temporary phase where there's an attempt to establish a new equilibri which needs to be negotiated.

</details>

**主持人**: Drew，非常简短地回答。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Drew, very quickly.

</details>

**Drew Fagan**: 我担心，正是如此。我担心是后者。很难去思考总统。他身边有聪明人，Jameson Greer 就是其中之一，他们思考中期、长期。但当然，这个政府面临着各种各样的问题。我们看到这一点也体现在与加拿大的关系上。你知道，我们加拿大有 4000 万人口，购买的美国商品和 3.4 亿美国人购买的商品一样多。我们怎么占他们便宜呢？我的意思是，如果你连加拿大都搞不好关系，你知道，你真的和谁都搞不好关系，这正是我现在担心的，但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Drew Fagan**: I fear Exactly right. I fear it's the second. It's hard to think about the president. He's got smart people around him. Jameson Greer um being one of them thinking medium-term, thinking long term. But of course, it's this administration with all sorts of problems. And we see that with regard to Canada. You know, we've got 40 million people in Canada who buy as much stuff from the United States as 340 million Americans buy from us. How are we taking advantage of them? I mean, if you can't get along with Canada, um, you know, you can't really get along with anybody, which is what I fear right now from the administration, but we'll see.

</details>

**主持人**: 先生们，我们就此打住。Eric，Drew，非常感谢你们的时间，非常感谢你们的见解。谢谢。

### 美联储与货币政策的独立性

**主持人**: 除了贸易战，唐纳德·特朗普还在向**美联储**（Federal Reserve）施压。那么，这会给我们的中央银行带来什么影响？我问了 **Heather Scoffield**，她分析经济政策已有 30 年，现任加拿大税务观察站（Canadian Tax Observatory）的首席执行官，关于这可能带来的潜在影响，以及我们是否以前经历过类似情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: On top of his trade wars, Donald Trump has also been putting pressure on the Federal Reserve. So, where does this leave our central bank? I asked Heather Scoffield, who has been analyzing economic policy for 30 years and is now CEO of the Canadian Tax Observatory, about the potential impact this could have here and abroad, and whether we've seen anything like it before.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们普遍认为，美国和加拿大的中央银行步调一致。这有多真实？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's a common view that the central banks in the US in and in Canada are in lock step. How true is that?

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 相当真实。并非百分之百，但确实相当真实。加拿大的经济与美国经济高度融合，所以当他们调整利率时，我们通常也会调整利率。在过去 25 年里，我们基本上与他们步调一致，除了几次例外。21 世纪初，我们曾走自己的路，因为我们面临一个保险问题，这影响了我们的价格。那是一次暂时的偏离。然后在**大金融危机**期间，我们也并未完全跟随他们，因为他们比我们陷入了更大的麻烦，所以他们降低利率的幅度比我们大。但我们仍然与他们同步行动，只是将利率保持得稍高一些。而在最近，过去三年，我们的利率与他们的不同。这部分是因为美国的经济增长强劲，而我们的增长不如那么强劲。所以我们走自己的路，将利率保持得比他们稍低一些。但我们一直在同步调整，只是稍低一些。所以毫无疑问，美国利率对加拿大利率的影响极其强大，两者之间的联系也极其紧密。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: It's pretty true. It's not 100% true, but it's pretty true. Um I mean the Canadian economy is so integrated with the United States that it makes sense that when they move their rates, we also move our rates. And over the course of uh I'd say the last 25 years, we've been pretty much in lock step with them except for on a couple of occasions. Early in the 2000s, we went our own way because we had an insurance issue that changed our prices. Um that was a temporary aberration. Um and then during the great financial crisis, um we um also didn't follow them exactly because they got themselves in an awful lot more trouble than we did and so they lowered their rates more than we did. Um but we still moved in parallel to them. We just kept them a little bit higher. And then more recently um in the last the last three years we've been um our rates have been different than theirs. Um and again that's partly because in in in the in in the United States growth is strong. Here it's not as strong. Um and so we've gone our own way and kept rates um lower a little bit lower than theirs. But we have moved every you know we're moving in parallel with them just a little bit lower. Um so there's no doubt um the influence of American rates over Canadian rates is it's it's extremely strong and the ties are extremely strong.

</details>

**主持人**: 唐纳德·特朗普总统一直在向现任美联储主席**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**（Jerome Powell）施压，要求其降低利率。请帮助我们理解这背后的争议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: President Donald Trump has been pressuring the current chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, to drop interest rates. Help us understand the controversy behind this.

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 中央银行在过去一代人的时间里，通过保持独立性而声名鹊起。这也是我们能够在许多富裕国家控制通胀的原因。虽然并不完美，但这是一个相当不错的实验。因为公众和投资者知道，他们的中央银行会采取行动，利用利率来控制通胀，而不是屈从于某人的政治冲动。所以，当唐纳德·特朗普出现并试图向杰罗姆·鲍威尔施压要求降息时，这可能极具破坏性。你知道，我们心里都清楚，很多政客想要宽松的货币。他们希望利率低于他们认为控制通胀所必需的水平。因为降低利率会刺激投资，可能会带来就业和增长的即时提振，这对于选民来说感觉很好，对于希望获得赞誉的政客来说也感觉很好。只是，对通胀的长期甚至中期影响可能非常毁灭性，对稳定性和投资环境的影响也可能被搅乱。所以，当唐纳德·特朗普向杰罗姆·鲍威尔施压，然后相应地更换美联储主席时，公众和投资者之间就会产生很多疑问和猜测，关于事情是否会像他们过去理解的那样运作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: So central banks have made their name over the course of the last generation by being independent. Um and that's the way uh we've been able to keep inflation under control in many rich countries. Um so well I mean it's not been perfect but it's been fairly a fairly good experiment. Um it's because you know people in the public and investors um know that their central banks will act um and use interest rates to control inflation and not to control somebody's political whims. And so when Donald Trump comes along and um tries to put pressure on on Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, um that's uh potentially quite destructive. Um you know, we know in the backs of our minds that a lot of politicians want easy money. They want to keep rates lower than they than they necessarily should be for inflation. Um because they lower rates uh incite investment. they could bring an immediate bump in terms of jobs and growth and that feels good uh for for the for the voting public and it feels good for a politician who wants some credit. It's just that the uh the longer term effects or even the medium-term effects on inflation could be quite devastating and the effects on stability um uh and the investment environment also thrown up into the air. So when Donald Trump is putting pressure on Jerome Powell um and uh then changes, you know, changes the the chairman of the Federal Reserve accordingly. Um there are a lot of questions being asked and a lot of um presumptions among the general public and among the among investors about whether things are going to operate as they've understood them to operate in the past.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我们来谈谈杰罗姆·鲍威尔的潜在继任者 **Kevin Worsh**。他已被提名，但仍需通过参议院的批准。但到目前为止，普遍的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk about Jerome Powell's potential replacement, Kevin Worsh. uh he has been named but uh still has to go through Senate. But what has the general reaction been so far?

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 嗯，**Mark Carney**（卡尼）曾表示这是一个“绝佳的选择”，这很有趣，因为我没想到 Mark Carney 会如此迅速地回应一位央行行长的任命。当然，我们的总理本人曾是央行行长，对 Kevin Worsh 的情况有深入了解。所以，是的，我们都想知道 Mark Carney 对 Kevin Worsh 的看法。但这种反应并非普遍。有许多分析师在研究这位被提名人，并表示他有“鹰派”历史，这意味着他倾向于紧缩通胀，这与唐纳德·特朗普完全不同。这怎么可能呢？还有很多关于他过去言论的有趣研究，似乎 Worsh 在共和党总统任期内愿意考虑降低利率。所以，你知道，我们正在通过政治而非他作为货币政策本身所做的事情来解读他过去的一切。但毫无疑问，他拥有货币政策的资历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: Well, Mark Carney came out and said it was a fantastic choice and um that was an interesting reaction because I I wouldn't have expected Mark Carney to um respond so quickly um to an announcement of a central banker. I mean obviously um our prime minister used to be a central banker himself and has had many has has a lot of insight into Kevin Marsh and who who he is and so okay yes of course we all want to know what Mark Carney thinks of Kevin Kevin Morris. So um that was an interesting reaction but it's not universal by any means. um you know there are a lot of analysts out there looking at the nominee um and saying okay he's got a history of a hawk meaning he has uh wanted to keep a tight grip on on inflation um which is not not Donald Trump at all so how does that work um and then there's been a lot of interesting um research into into um his worship statements over over the past little while and it seems that there's a there's there's some um willingness on the part of Wars to think about lower interest rates under a Republican president. So, you know, we're interpreting everything that he's done in the past through through politics rather than what he's done through um through monetary policy per se. But there's no doubt he has got monetary policy credentials.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果是后者（指受政治影响），那意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: If it is the latter, what does that mean?

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 如果他有共和党倾向，或者对唐纳德·特朗普有同情心，那么我们都会密切关注。他必须说服美联储其他参与决策的人同意他的观点，因为这不仅仅取决于他一个人，但他将极具影响力。而且，从长远来看，如果他为总统效力，那么人们将密切关注通胀和债券市场的借贷条件会发生什么，不仅在美国，而且在全球范围内。我们已经看到市场因他的提名而波动。你知道，世界各地的货币会根据他的行动而波动，包括加拿大元。因此，这会影响我们的借贷条件，并影响我们未来的经济。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: Well, if he's got Republican tendencies and or if he's got um some sympathy for for Donald Trump, um he's um we will everybody will be watching for that for sure. He has to persuade uh everybody else um involved in making decisions at the Federal Reserve uh to go his way because it's not just up to him, but um he is extremely he will be extremely influential. Um and over the longer term, you know, if he's doing the pro if he's doing the president's bidding for him, um there's going to be uh some some an awful lot of scrutiny to see what happens to inflation and um borrowing conditions in the bond market, not just in the United States, but around the world. We're already seeing markets move as a result of his his nomination. Um you know, currencies around the world will fluctuate uh based on on what he does, including the Canadian dollar. And so um that influences uh our our borrowing conditions and influences um our economy going forward.

</details>

**主持人**: Heather，在我们最后的 30 秒，如果贸易紧张局势持续，并且美加经济不再步调一致、不再像过去那样融合，我们能从**加拿大银行**（Bank of Canada）的货币政策中期待什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Heather, in our last 30 seconds, if if trade tensions continue and the US and Canadian economies are no longer in that lock step and aren't as integrated, what can we expect from the Bank of Canada's monetary policy?

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 加拿大银行的运作方式很直接。他们专注于**通胀**。他们根据他们认为通胀将走向何方来提高或降低利率。我不认为这会改变。只是通胀的走向与美国的情况息息相关。是的，我们听到了很多关于我们贸易如何实现与美国分离的说法。但我认为，事实是我们仍然与他们高度融合。不仅是我们的贸易，更重要的是我们的金融市场和投资流动。因此，我预计我们将与美国同步行动，可能不是每一次都完全一致，但会频繁同步，在可预见的未来都是如此。在你 30 年的经济政策报道生涯中，你见过类似的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: So the Bank of Canada plays are pretty straight. They are fixated with uh inflation. They um raise and lower rates according to where they think inflation is going to go. And I don't expect that to change. It's just that what happens to inflation is very tied into what happens with the United States. And yes, we hear an awful lot about um you know diverging um our trade away from the United States. But I think the the the fact of the matter is we are still very very integrated with them. Um not just our trade but our more importantly our financial markets and our investment flows. And so I expect we will be moving in lock step maybe not every single time but frequently with the United States for some time to come. In your 30 years of reporting on economic policy, have you seen anything like this before?

</details>

**Heather Scoffield**: 我没有。我指的是，加拿大银行上周公布了他们的预测和对加拿大经济的评估，他们的第一段说“过去几个月一切都差不多”。而他们的第二段是“但这是如此不可预测，我们不知道会走向何方”。这对他们来说非常罕见，竟然说他们完全看不清未来。所以，你知道，他们基本上是瘫痪了，因为他们无法弄清楚接下来会发生什么。我研究了过去几十年来世界各地的金融危机，看到了很多动荡，但我从未见过像现在这样，找不到前进方向的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heather Scoffield**: I have not. I mean, it's interesting with the Bank of Canada, they came out with their their forecast uh and their their assessment of the Canadian economy last week and um their first paragraph was saying everything is kind of the same over the last few months. And their second paragraph is but it's so unpredictable we have no idea where we're going. And that is very um very rare for them to say that they they can't see into the future at all. So that you know they're basically paralyzed because they can't figure out where things are going next. I mean I've looked at financial crises around the world over the last few decades and seen a lot of disruption but I've never seen anything like this in terms of not having a way forward.
