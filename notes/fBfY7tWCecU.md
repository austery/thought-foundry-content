title: Gamma创始人Grant Lee：如何将AI演示公司发展到1亿用户
---

### 早期融资的挑战与反思

我进行了第三次路演，感觉进行得相当顺利。我停下来等待投资人的反应，他基本上说：“这绝对是我听过的最糟糕的主意。你不仅要与强大的**现有企业**（incumbents: 在市场中占据主导地位的成熟公司）竞争，他们还拥有极致的分销能力。你根本无法与他们竞争。”

<p class="english-text">I get into my third pitch and it goes pretty well I feel like and I kind of pause and wait for the, you know, investor's reaction. He basically says, "This has got to be the worst idea I've ever heard. Not only are you going up against massive incumbents, they have ultimate distribution. There is no way you're going to compete against them."</p>
</details>

在我还没来得及说什么之前，他就挂断了电话，直接退出了Zoom会议。我给自己一点时间来消化他所说的话，并试图从中找出一些真相，那就是：是的，进入这个市场将会异常艰难。我们必须从一开始就考虑增长，如果我们有任何成功的机会，产品增长和市场增长必须融入我们的战略之中。

<p class="english-text">Before I could just say anything, he hangs up. He just drops off the Zoom call. I kind of gave myself just a chance to internalize what he was saying. Try to like pull out some of the truth in that which is yeah going into this market is going to be incredibly hard. We need to think about growth from the very beginning and if we have any chance of succeeding product growth those need to be intertwined in our strategy.</p>

>> 感谢您的到来，Grant。

<p class="english-text">>> Thank you for coming Grant.</p>

</details>

>> 您是目前最成功的AI应用之一的联合创始人兼领导者。您的**年度经常性收入**（AR: Annual Recurring Revenue）已超过1亿美元，用户数量也接近1亿。我们非常高兴能与您谈论您最近的产品发布、在企业市场的拓展，以及回顾一下构建Gamma这家公司的整个过程。也许就从这里开始，让我们把时间倒回到五年前，也就是2020年，您和您的联合创始人创办Gamma的时候。从那时起，显然经历了很多曲折，感觉我们经历了大约三个宏观周期和两个技术周期。很多事情都变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You co-founded and are leading one of the most successful AI applications right now. You've crossed 100 million of AR. You're approaching 100 million users. We are so stoked to talk to you about all of your recent product launches, expanding in the enterprise, and maybe taking a step back just the process of building Gamma itself as a company. Maybe to just kick that off on on that note, um we'll rewind time and and bring it back uh 5 years ago when you and your co-founders started Gamma in 2020. Um there's obviously been a ton of twists and turns since then and it feels like we've been in maybe three macro cycles, two technology cycles. Um lot changed.</p>
</details>

>> 确实变化很大。您能多分享一些关于这个过程是怎样的，以及一路上有哪些重要的突破吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> A lot has changed. Exactly. Um can you share a little bit more about what that process has been like and what were some of the big unlocks along the way?</p>
</details>

>> 当然。讲述最初的融资故事总是很有趣，因为当时的世界与现在截然不同。我们正处于疫情高峰期，那是2020年底，大部分融资都是通过Zoom进行的。所以很多我早期尝试接触的投资人，我从未见过本人。当时我住在伦敦，所以要在世界的另一边安排这些路演，我必须在半夜进行。我还有两个小孩，所以对我来说，通常是孩子们睡着后，我们住在一个相当简朴的公寓里，我就会找个小角落，实际上是藏在小厨房和洗衣房之间的一个小空间。我会设置一个假的Zoom背景，这样没人能看出我在哪里，然后尽量轻声说话，以免吵醒孩子们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. It's it's uh always fun to kind of tell the initial sort of fundraising story because the world was just such a different place. We're you know peak pandemic. This is the end of 2020 where most of you know fundraising was just done over Zoom. So a lot of the investors I was trying to pitch early on you know I never met in person. I was actually living in London at the time so you know different part of the world trying to line up these pitches. Um I'd have to do so in the middle of the night. I also have two little kids and so for me it was you know after kids go to sleep uh we had a pretty modest flat so I would kind of find a little corner. was actually tucked between the kitchenet and the laundry room little space. Put up a fake, you know, Zoom background so nobody could tell where I was. Uh, and tried to talk somewhat softly so that, you know, don't wake up the kids.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，开始路演时，我想：“好吧，第一周，就是连续的路演。”第一天，我进行了第三次路演，感觉进行得相当顺利。我觉得，你知道，进行了20分钟，感觉“嘿，这还不错。”然后我停下来等待投资人的反应。他基本上说：“这绝对是我听过的最糟糕的主意。”他说：“你不仅要与强大的现有企业竞争，他们还拥有极致的分销能力。你根本无法与他们竞争。”所以，你知道，在我脑海里，我想：“嗯，这可不是我预期的。”我得想一个很好的反驳。但在我还没来得及说什么之前，他就挂断了电话，直接退出了Zoom会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, starting the pitch, I was like, "Okay, first week, uh, you know, it was just lining backtoback pitches." And the first day I get into my third pitch and, you know, it goes off like, you know, it goes pretty well. I feel like, you know, going through it 20 minutes in, feeling like, hey, this this is not too bad. Uh, and I kind of pause and wait for the, you know, investor's reaction. And, uh, he basically, you know, says, this has got to be the worst idea I've ever heard. And he said, not only are you going up against massive incumbents, they have ultimate distribution. There is no way you're going to compete against them. And so, you know, in my head, I was like, "Well, that's uh that wasn't what I was expecting." And uh I got to think of like a really good rebuttal. And uh before I could say anything, he hangs up. He just drops off the Zoom call.</p>
</details>

所以我当时想：“哇，好吧。”你知道，那一刻你心里会想，如果他是对的呢？如果他对这一切都是对的呢？也许这是一个愚蠢的主意。所以，你会开始产生这些怀疑。我没有太多时间沮丧，因为我必须为下一次路演做准备。所以在那个时刻，我给了自己一个机会来消化他所说的话，并试图从中找出一些真相，那就是：是的，进入这个市场将会异常艰难。我们必须从一开始就考虑增长。如果我们有任何成功的机会，产品增长和市场增长必须融入我们的战略之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I'm like, "Wow, okay." You know, this feeling of really this moment you're kind of thinking in your head, you know, what if he's right? You know, what if he's right about all this? Maybe this is a dumb idea. And so, you kind of have those dou doubts kind of creeping up into your head. I didn't really have much time to kind of get down on myself because I had to prep for the next pitch. And so in that moment, I kind of gave myself just a chance to internalize what he was saying, try to like pull out some of the truth in that, which is, yeah, going into this market is going to be incredibly hard. We need to think about growth from the very beginning. And if we have any chance of like succeeding, like product growth, those need to be intertwined in our strategy.</p>
</details>

所以，我把这些话记在心里，尽管听起来很痛苦。当然，也许有更温和的方式来表达这些话。但我们还是回去了，最终，幸运的是，我们成功筹集到了资金。五年过去了，我们正在取得不错的进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so kind of took that to heart uh even though it's painful to hear. And uh certainly maybe there could have been a kinder way to say those words. Uh still went back and eventually, you know, fortunately we were able to raise money. 5 years in we're we're making some good progress.</p>
</details>

>> 哇。我会说进展非常顺利。是的，这太棒了。你们在启动Gamma时是**前AI时代**（pre-AI: 指人工智能技术尚未普及或成熟的时期），对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wow. I'll say good progress. Yeah, that's amazing. And it was preai when you started Gamma. Is that right?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，前AI时代。我想我们一直以来的目标是让任何人都能轻松、不费力地创建内容。所以，快速和速度的本质一直都在。但AI恰好在旅程的几年后，成为了一份巨大的礼物，它真正加速了整个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> PreI. I think the spirit of what we wanted to do all along was to make it easy, effortless for anybody to create content. So the nature of like being fast and you know that the speed aspect was always there. But AI happened to be a great gift a few years into the journey that really just expedited the entire process there.</p>
</details>

### 产品设计哲学：平衡AI与用户体验

>> 是的。我一直很好奇的一件事是，因为1亿用户是一个庞大的数字，其中一些人可能了解并喜欢AI工具，而另一些人可能不了解。随着AI的发展，您如何考虑在产品中暴露多少AI功能？比如，甚至给用户选择自己的图像模型的选项，您如何平衡其易用性和复杂性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. One of the things I've been curious about cuz 100 million users is like a lot of users and some of them might know and love AI tools and some of them might not. Y as AI has evolved, how do you think about how much AI you expose in the product? Like even giving users the choice to pick their own image model like how easy or or complex do you make that?</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。是的，这是一个不断变化的目标。你知道，我在斯坦福大学时很幸运有一位导师，**IDEO**（IDEO: 一家全球知名的设计咨询公司）的创始人**David Kelly**。他的故事是，早期他们发明了第一款**Apple**鼠标，对吧？当时，**Xerox**（Xerox: 施乐公司，美国一家主要生产复印机、打印机等办公设备的公司）已经有了一款鼠标，它是一个三键鼠标，非常昂贵，不适合大众消费。所以，对于那些技术非常精通的人来说，他们知道如何操作，现在听起来可能有点傻，甚至三个按钮也让人望而生畏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Yeah. And it's it's a moving target. You know, I when I was at um Sanford, I was lucky enough to have a mentor, David Kelly, who was the founder of IDO. Um and his story, you know, early on he was uh you know, they invented the first Apple mouse, right? And so like at the time, like you know, Xerox already had a mouse. It was um a three-b button mouse, two very very expensive, wasn't built for mass consumption. And so, you know, for someone that's super technical, they knew how to navigate kind of sounds silly now even, you know, three buttons kind of, you know, intimidating.</p>
</details>

所以，**David Kelly**的方法始终是，你需要对用户的处境有极强的同理心。因此，他们实际上发明了单键鼠标，超级简单。任何人都可以点击一个按钮。我认为这会随着时间而改变。所以，我认为我们现在可能正处于AI的“单键时代”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so his approach, David Kelly's approach was always, you need to be super empathetic for where users are. And so they actually invented, you know, the one button mouse, super easy. Anybody can click one button. And I think it's going to change over time. So I think we're right now maybe in the one button era of like AI where</p>
</details>

>> 绝大多数人仍然在努力弄清楚如何使用这个东西？它功能强大，但也令人望而生畏。所以我们需要认识到这一点。我认为很容易就对“哦，聊天提示框不是终极形式”这种说法嗤之以鼻。这可能对，也可能不对，但聊天也非常容易访问和熟悉。所以我想我们自己也在努力摸索，什么是正确的切入点。很多时候，我们都在观察用户如何使用**Gamma**（Gamma: 一款AI驱动的演示文稿制作工具），然后看看他们在哪里碰壁，或者与预期相差甚远，并尝试一路解决问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the vast majority of people like they're still trying to figure out how do we even use this thing? It's powerful but intimidating. And so we need to recognize that. I think it's easy to kind of throw shade at oh, you know, a chat prompt box is is not the ultimate form factor. That may or may not be true, but chat is also very accessible and familiar. And so I think we're trying to navigate that ourselves, like what is the right entry point. A lot of it is spending time observing users, how they use Gamma, and then seeing where they just run into a wall or fall really short of expectations and try to fix things along the way.</p>
</details>

### 差异化竞争与AI原生陷阱

>> 是的，是的。我认为有一件事让我们感到惊讶，那就是不仅AI演示文稿很难做好，而且市场上的产品也大相径庭。Olivia和我实际上已经尝试了20多个

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. I think one thing that surprised us in a in a sense was just how not only how hard it is to get AI presentations right, but also how different the products are on the market. Olivia and I have literally tried 20 plus</p>
</details>

>> 市场上的竞争者，结果真是天壤之别。您能多分享一些关于它为什么这么难，以及你们做对了什么吗？是的，我的意思是，我认为在过去十年中，甚至在AI出现之前，就已经有多次尝试了，对吧？那里有一个演示工具的“坟墓”。我认为那些前AI时代的工具陷入了另一个陷阱，那就是它们试图成为**渐进式改进的幻灯片软件**（incrementally better slideware: 指在传统幻灯片软件基础上进行小幅优化，而非颠覆性创新的产品）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> players out there and the results are night and day. Um, can you share more about what is so hard about it and what you guys got right? Yeah, I mean I think you know there's been multiple attempts just you know throughout the past decade even preAI right like there's a graveyard of you know presentation tools out there. I think you know the the ones that are preAI kind of got stuck in a different trap which is they tried to be you know incrementally better slideware.</p>
</details>

所以它们仍然是16x9的格式，你仍然有一个画布，作为最终用户，你必须自己搞清楚布局、图层、调整大小等。对于普通人来说，即使你在某个维度上提高了10倍，**PowerPoint**（PowerPoint: 微软公司开发的演示文稿软件）也已经有40年的时间来添加所有可能的功能。那么你最终如何竞争呢？当然，他们确实拥有分销能力。所以这变得非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they still do the 16x9 thing and you still have like this sort of canvas where you as the end user have to figure out, you know, the layouts, the layers, you know, resizing things and for you the average person, you know, if even if you're kind of 10x better on one dimension, PowerPoint's had 40 years to add every single piece of functionality possible. And so how do you ultimately compete? And of course, yeah, they do have distribution. And so it becomes pretty hard.</p>
</details>

我认为对我们来说，早期我们就知道，要在这个领域竞争，俗话说得好，与其更好，不如不同，对吧？与其更好，不如不同。所以对我们来说，我们想从根本上有所不同。有哪些不同的**基本元素**（primitives: 指构成系统或产品最基础、最核心的组成部分或功能）或构建模块不是16x9的幻灯片，却能让没有设计技能、没有设计资源的普通人能够超快速地创建内容？这就是最初的差异化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think for us like early on we knew that to compete in this category you know the saying is it's better to be different than better right like it's better to be different than better and so for us we wanted to be fundamentally different what are the different you know set of primitives or building blocks that aren't 16 by9 slides that allows the average person that doesn't have design skills that doesn't have design resources to be able to create content super fast. So that was kind of the initial differentiation.</p>
</details>

我认为今天几乎存在一个单独的陷阱，那就是作为一家AI原生初创公司，你可以大量依赖AI模型，并假设它们会越来越好，它们确实会。但这几乎变成了一种拐杖，因为你试图预测，我不想创造一些模型会颠覆我所创造的一切的东西。所以你并不真正愿意去理解，我如何在两者之间创造一些东西，给人们一个起点，仍然有人类参与其中，这非常具有挑战性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think today there's almost a separate trap which is uh being an AI native startup you can lean a lot on just the AI models and assume they're going to get better and better which they will but then that almost becomes a crutch because you're trying to anticipate well I don't want to sort of you know create something that the model is going to disrupt you know everything I've created and so you're not really willing to understand okay how do I create something in between that gives people a starting point that still has human in the loop and it's pretty challenging.</p>
</details>

我认为对我们来说，我们在时机上很幸运，因为我们是在AI出现之前开始的，我们对哪些构建模块很重要有一个**理论假设**（thesis: 指对某一特定领域或问题提出的核心观点、论点或研究方向），然后我们一路将它与AI结合起来，这样我们就能两全其美。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for us we were sort of lucky in the timing in that we started pre-AI, we had a thesis around what building blocks would be important and then we married that with AI along the way so that we kind of get the best of both worlds.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这非常引人入胜。我想，嗯，也许只是稍微深入探讨一下这个话题，你知道，嘿，我们正在对抗**微软**（Microsoft: 跨国科技公司）和**谷歌**（Google: 跨国科技公司），世界上最大的科技巨头。但另一方面，对吧，你可能会从其他人那里听到，嘿，随着模型变得越来越好，这是否会由**前沿模型**（frontier models: 指当前最先进、能力最强的AI模型）来解决，你可以一键生成一个很棒的AI演示文稿？嗯，多谈谈为什么这种现实也

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that's that's fascinating. And I think um maybe just to pull on that thread a little bit, you know, hey, we're coming up against Microsoft, Google, the biggest tech juggernauts um in the world. Uh but on the flip side, right, you know, people you might hear from others that, hey, is this just going to be solved by the frontier models as the models get better, you can oneshot a great AI presentation? Um talk more about why that reality is also</p>
</details>

>> 也许不是你所害怕的，而且，你知道，除了单一模型本身，**Gamma**还在其之上增加了什么样的价值。是的，我的意思是，我们认为，你知道，对于某些任务，也许通才方法或像你所说的超级应用可以完成很多这些事情，对于一次性的演示文稿，这实际上可能是一个可行的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> maybe one that you're not afraid of and um you know beyond sort of a single model itself like what kind of value gamma is adding on top. Yeah, I mean the way we see it is, you know, for certain tasks u maybe a generalist approach or like you know super app can probably do a lot of these things and for one-off presentations that might be actually a viable you know solution for that case.</p>
</details>

我认为对于任何时候，如果需要完成的工作确实是最终用户试图做的核心工作。所以在这个案例中，比如视觉沟通、商务沟通、视觉讲故事，有很多事情需要发生才能让它感觉正确。对吧？作为创作者，你需要感觉自己有很多输入。嗯，你希望参与其中，因为这是你正在讲述的故事，而不是AI的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for anytime where the job to be done is really core to you know what the end user is trying to do. So in this case like visual communication, business communication, visual storytelling, there's a lot that happens to make that feel right. Right. And you as a creator need to have feel like you have a lot of input. um you want to be involved in that because it is your story you're telling. It's not the AI story.</p>
</details>

所以当你真正深入探讨成为一个优秀的视觉讲故事工具意味着什么时，这项工作需要完成，有很多不同的工作流程，甚至对我们来说，协调所有不同的模型，无论是文本、图像、视频还是音频，都有很多事情发生。那么你如何将所有这些打包，以便，你知道，最终用户仍然能够玩转、编辑、操作所有这些东西，我们只是认为，你知道，这需要一个非常特定的工具才能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you start going really really deep into what it means to be you know great visual storytelling tool like that job to be done there's a lot of different workflows for us even orchestrating all the different models whether it's you know on the text side image side video audio there's a lot going on there and so how do you package that all up so that um you know it feels good for the end user to be able to still you know play with this you know edit manipulate all those things and we just think that you know that that requires a really specific tool to be able to do that.</p>
</details>

嗯，即使你思考这种演变，对我们来说，就像从单人模式到多人模式，协作的能力，拥有共享工作区，拥有一个集中式的内容存储库，这些也是难以解决的问题。当然你可以做到，但是对于一个超级应用来说，如果它要做到这一点，它就会开始偏离，它就会开始偏离他们可能长期以来的愿望。比如他们确实想成为一个通用应用，这意味着他们必须牺牲很多这些细粒度的**点解决方案**（point solutions: 指针对特定问题或需求提供单一、独立功能的软件或服务），这些可能不符合他们的长期愿景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, even as you think about kind of the evolution of that for us is like you to go from single player mode to multiplayer mode, the ability to collaborate, have a shared workspace, have like a central repository of things that you're you're pulling into content, those are also difficult problems to solve. And certainly you can do it, but um for for like a you know, for a super app to do that, it it's it's like then you're starting to tease away, you're starting to pull away from what maybe their long-term aspiration is. like they do want to be the all-purpose app and that means they have to sacrifice a lot of these sort of granular point solutions that may not fit with their long-term vision.</p>
</details>

### 从构想到产品：Gamma的创新之路

>> 是的，这很有趣，因为**Gamma**的神奇之处，或者至少一部分神奇之处，来自于AI，比如新的**Agentic 3.0**（Agentic 3.0: Gamma公司推出的新版本，可能包含更智能的代理功能）发布非常棒，以及其中的编辑功能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's interesting cuz a lot of what's magical or at least some of what's magical about Gamma comes from AI like the new Agentic 3.0 launch is amazing and the editing capabilities there</p>
</details>

>> 还有一些似乎是您的团队对演示文稿和沟通应该如何运作的新见解。是什么过程让您以不同的方式做到这一点？是的。所以这部分是，你知道，当我们第一次创办**Gamma**时，这个最初的想法，或者说我们最初的想法是如何产生的，是我在被收购之前在另一家初创公司工作。然后我回到了我的老本行，也就是咨询。我当时在为早期阶段的初创公司提供咨询。我用来创建演示文稿的工具是**Google Slides**（Google Slides: 谷歌公司开发的在线演示文稿制作工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and then some of it just seems to be new insights that your team had around how presentations and communications should work like what what was the process that led you to doing that differently? Yeah. So part of this was you know when we first started Gamma you know the this inception idea or like how we came about the initial idea was I was working at a different startup before we were acquired uh and I went back into my roots which is consulting. I was advising early stage startups and what I was using to sort of create presentations was you know Google Slides.</p>
</details>

所以，我进去，你知道，其中一个非常非常重要的时刻是，嗯，深夜时分，我正在为第二天的会议做准备，感觉我把所有时间都花在了格式化演示文稿上，只是为了让它看起来体面，不至于让人觉得我什么都没做。那一刻我感觉，你知道，一定有更好的方法。这感觉太落后了，为什么我把90%的时间花在格式化上，而10%的时间花在内容上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I go in, you know, this the really really one of the moments was like uh late at night trying to prepare for a meeting the next day and just feeling like I was spending all this time trying to format the deck to look decent so that it didn't look like I didn't do any work. I had this moment feeling like, you know, there's got to be a better way. This feels so backwards, like why am I spending 90% of the time on the formatting and and 10% of the time on the content?</p>
</details>

所以，当我们退一步思考，好吧，你知道，**PowerPoint**大约在40年前发明，什么改变了？嗯，我们能预测哪些事情会继续改变？其中之一是，你知道，我们分享信息的方式显然改变了，你知道，疫情高峰期，当然，很多工作都转向了虚拟或通过Zoom进行。所以，你知道，如果内容不是静态的16x9，而是更具可塑性，默认情况下就能适应移动设备，那会怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, when we kind of took a step back just to think about, okay, you know, again, PowerPoint invented almost 40 years ago, what has changed? Um what are some of the things that we can sort of anticipate continue to change. One is you know the way we share information obviously changed you know peak pandemic of course so much work shifted to virtual or like you know over zoom and so you know what if instead of having um content that was you know static 16x9 it was much more malleable. It could be something that could be mobile responsive by default.</p>
</details>

所以如果我分享给你一些东西，你在手机上打开，你可以像浏览网站一样滚动浏览，而且相同的内容可以自然地流动。我们还想，你知道，为什么不只拥有大多数演示文稿中的文本和图像，如果它能包含更多多媒体内容呢？所以你实际上可以把整个网站嵌入到你正在展示的内容中，因为，你知道，这是一种让你的展示内容更丰富的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I shared something with you open on your phone, you could scroll through it just like you would, you know, a website and um and that same content can kind of flow naturally there. We also thought, you know, why instead of just having, you know, most presentations just text and images, what if it could be more multimedia rich? So you could literally embed an entire website into what you're presenting because, you know, that's a way for you to have much more richness in what you're actually trying to showcase.</p>
</details>

嗯，然后当然，与其像标准幻灯片演示文稿那样，我说“嘿，下一张幻灯片”，然后点击，如果它能互动呢？你知道，如果它能让你点击的每个东西都实际打开，就像我们接受的网页原则一样，你知道，**渐进式披露**（progressive disclosure: 一种用户界面设计原则，即在用户需要时才显示更多信息，避免一次性呈现过多内容）的整个概念，这应该也适用于演示文稿。如果异步阅读，你可以选择自己的路径；如果我向你演示，我可以成为讲故事的人，并实际引导你完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then of course like rather than you know a standard slide deck where I'm saying hey next slide please and clicking on it what if it could be interactive you know what if it could be something where everything you click on it could actually open up just like the principles that we've embraced with web like you know the whole notion of uh you know progressive disclosure like that that should apply to presentations as well is I can either if you're reading it async you can choose your own adventure or if I'm presenting it to you I can be the storyteller and actually guide you through this.</p>
</details>

我们觉得这些都是，嗯，你知道，在网站创建方面似乎很明显，或者我们可能已经习以为常的事情，为什么不能为那些没有设计技能、没有技术资源、可能不懂代码的普通人提供同样的功能，并让他们能够比以前做更多的事情呢？

<p class="english-text">And we felt like those were all things um you know seem obvious or maybe we've already taken grant for granted on the website you know side of creation and and why not be able to offer that same set of things for the average person that again doesn't have design skills doesn't have technical resources maybe doesn't know how to code and just empower them to do way more than they could otherwise</p>

### Gamma的未来展望：通用痛点与AI化身

>> 您看到了什么？我的意思是，我喜欢**Gamma**解锁的这种演变，而且，嗯，如果您考虑下一步，嗯，我们甚至看到**AI化身**（avatars: 指在虚拟世界中代表用户或特定角色的数字形象）正在做一些有趣的事情，通常是在销售场景中。它仍处于非常早期阶段，但您如何看待什么是最有趣的，以及**Gamma**的下一步是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> what what do you see I mean I love this evolution of what's been unlocked on Gamma and um if you think about uh what's next um even we're seeing interesting things being done with avatars um often in a sales context. It's still very early innings, but how do you think about um what's most interesting and what's kind of coming up next for Gamma?</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。是的，你知道，我们努力关注的其中一件事是，嗯，普遍存在的痛点。所以，当谈到**Gamma**的基础时，很多见解是，你知道，我们都是视觉学习者，但我们中很少有人是背景出身的视觉设计师，对吧？那么，我们如何赋能人们成为优秀的视觉讲故事者呢？我认为在这个领域，你知道，还有另一种技能，很多人对此感到恐惧，那就是演讲，他们可能不太自信地走进一个房间，然后，你知道，能够清晰地表达自己的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Yeah. You know, one of the things we try to focus on are um you know, universal pain points. So, when it comes to just even the foundation for gamma, a lot of the insight was, you know, very, you know, we're all visual learners, but very few of us are visual designers by background, right? And so, how can we empower people to be good visual storytellers? I think within this sort of space, you know, there's another skill set that a lot of people have fear about, which is presenting and they're not maybe super confident going up into a room and like, you know, being able to articulate their thoughts.</p>
</details>

我觉得这就像一个巨大的，你知道，如果人们做不好，那意味着他们的想法永远无法进入世界。我觉得，你知道，如果真是这样，那将是一个令人失望的结果。所以当然，是的，AI化身的概念，或者像你所说的，一个可以说话或能够代表你用你的声音表达想法的演示文稿。嗯，我认为这些都是超级令人兴奋的探索，因为它们再次回到了这些普遍存在的痛点，或者像你所说的，人们天生不擅长的事情，我们可以一路帮助他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I feel like that's like a huge, you know, like if people can't do that well, then that just means their ideas never make it to, you know, into the world. And and I feel like that's that's a, you know, that that's really a disappointing outcome if that's the case. And so of course, yeah, the the whole notion of maybe AI avatars or like a, you know, a presentation that can speak or have, you know, articulate your thoughts on your behalf using your voice. Um, I think those are all super exciting explorations because again, it goes back to some of these universal pain points or like, you know, things that people aren't inherently great at that we can help assist them along the way.</p>
</details>

>> 演示文稿有点像最终的输出单元，它通常是大量工作和大量思考的下游产物，如果它是一个好的演示文稿的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The the presentation is kind of like a final unit of output is is downstream of like a lot of work and also a lot of thinking usually if it's a good presentation.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，您如何看待**Gamma**在演示前空间能走多远？比如，您做了多少工作来帮助用户从最初的想法萌芽，到清晰地阐述一个论点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, how do you think about how far gamma goes in the pre-presentation space? Like how much do you do to help users get from like the initial grain of an idea into like a pretty clear articulation of a thesis?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这是一个很好的问题。对我们来说，我们希望做到**端到端**（end-to-end: 指从开始到结束的整个过程），对吧？当某人有了一个想要分享的想法时，我们希望在那里帮助他们构建，甚至帮助他们创建最初的叙事或故事弧线。然后当他们想要创建初稿时，我们希望在那里帮助他们创建大纲，并能够实际地把一些东西塑造成形。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's a great uh great question. For us, we we want to be endto end, right? The moment someone has some inkling of an idea that they want to share, we want to be there for them to help structure that, help really maybe even create that initial, you know, narrative or story arc. And then the moment they want to create that first draft, you want to be there to help them create that outline uh and and be able to actually put something where you're putting some shape around it.</p>
</details>

然后当你确实需要一个设计伙伴来帮助你编辑和真正完善想法时，我们希望我们的**代理**（agent: 指人工智能系统中的一个自主实体，能够感知环境、做出决策并执行行动）能够审查你已经创建的一切，并提供建议，甚至为你进行设计更改。然后当然，当你实际分享和向他人展示时，我们希望你有一个反馈循环，比如人们在与什么互动？什么内容真正引起共鸣？人们在哪里卡壳了？这样你就可以回去完善整个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when you do want uh a design partner to help you edit and like really refine the thinking, we want you know that our agent to be able to review everything you've already created and offer suggestions, maybe even make the design changes for you. And then of course the moment you're actually sharing it and presenting to others, we want to you to have a feedback loop like what are people engaging with? Like what content actually resonates? What are people getting stuck on? so that you can go back and refine the entire process.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，我们确实希望，你知道，今天我认为我们在中间部分做得相当好。嗯，你可能已经完成了初稿，你有一些编辑功能。我确实认为我们有机会完全闭环，而且就你所说的，甚至在旅程的最初部分。我认为我们可以在那里做更多的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so yeah, we do hope, you know, today I think we do decently well sort of in the middle. Uh you have maybe the initial first draft done, you have some of the editing capabilities. I do think we have an opportunity to really close the loop entirely and and to your point even like the very very first part of the journey. I think there's a ton more we could do there.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，是的。完全正确。嗯，我知道Olivia提到了**Gamma 3.0**的发布，那是几周前的事情了。嗯，非常令人兴奋的发布，非常成功。嗯，其中包含了代理、团队、API，一天之内发布了很多东西。一个盛大的发布日。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. Totally. And um I know Olivia touched on the Gamma 3.0 launch which was you know a few weeks ago now. Um very exciting launch, very successful. Uh, and within that you had agent, teams, API, there's a lot coming out in one day. Big big launch day. Um,</p>
</details>

>> 而且，你知道，我认为当我们使用代理时，感觉就像身边有一个设计伙伴。嗯，我很好奇。我知道现在还处于早期阶段，但它如何改变了用户与**Gamma**的互动方式，至少对于那些尝试过的人来说？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and you know, I think when we use agent, it feels like having a design partner alongside you. Um, I'm curious. I know it's early days, but how has it changed the way your users interact with with gamma to for the ones that have tried it at least?</p>
</details>

### 产品发布策略：从1.0到3.0

>> 是的，完全正确。我可能想快速分享一个观点，那就是，你知道，我认为，你知道，我们发布了3.0。嗯，我认为思考1.0、2.0和3.0发布之间的区别是有帮助的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, totally. I'll maybe want quickly just share one perspective, which is, you know, I think, you know, we launched 3.0. Um, I think it's helpful just to think about like, you know, what is what is the difference between like a 1.0, 2.0, and a 3.0 launch?</p>
</details>

>> 对我来说，1.0发布主要是为了真正的**创新者**（innovators: 指那些愿意尝试新事物、走在前沿的用户群体），或者那些真正愿意尝试任何新事物的人。他们喜欢新东西，对吧？你可以称他们为AI游客，但他们基本上是因为喜欢玩耍、测试所有这些工具而去的。他们中的许多人可能不会留下来，我认为这没关系。但你开始获得一些关于什么有趣、什么不有趣、什么真正有用的初步能量。当然，你必须回去并实际继续改进产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> For me, like the 1.0 launch is all about really going after the true sort of innovators or the people that are really willing to like try whatever's out there. They love the new things, right? And uh you can call them AI tourists, but they're basically going out there because they love playing around, testing all these tools. Many of them may not stick around and I think that's okay. But you're starting to get some of this initial energy around like what's interesting, what's not, what's actually useful. And of course, you have then to go back and actually continue to improve upon the product.</p>
</details>

当你进行2.0发布时，你终于有机会赢得你认为是**早期采用者**（early adopters: 指在产品生命周期中较早接受和使用新产品或技术的人群）的用户。嗯，这些人仍然，你知道，愿意忍受产品中的许多缺陷或不足，但他们第一次开始向你提出产品需求。他们有一长串的功能请求。他们看到它在某些用例中有效，这很棒。你将这些反馈带回去，然后开始，你知道，进一步充实你的路线图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you get to your 2.0 launch, you finally have a chance to kind of win over what you consider as like the early adopters. Uh people that um still are, you know, willing to kind of put up with a lot of gaps or you deficiencies product, but for the first time they're starting to pull product out of you. They have a whole long list of like feature requests. They see it kind of working for certain use cases and that's great. Like you take that feedback back and you start, you know, actually fleshing out your road map even further.</p>
</details>

然后你最终进行3.0发布，我认为这就像，你知道，如果你把它映射到**跨越鸿沟**（crossing the chasm: 指高科技产品从早期市场进入主流市场所面临的挑战），你第一次尝试打入大众市场。你有一个机会拥有一款真正可用、值得信赖的产品。我认为这就是我们今天的处境。所以对我们来说，你知道，我们正在发布几件不同的事情。其中之一就是我们现在可以服务各种规模的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you finally get to your 3.0 launch, which I think is like, you know, if you were to map it to crossing the chasm, like you're for the first time trying to hit the mass market. You have a chance to have a product that can actually be used and be relied on and people can trust it. And I think that's where we're at today. And so for us, you know, there's a few different things, you know, we're releasing. One is just this notion that we can actually serve businesses of all sizes now, right?</p>
</details>

我认为我们正在从单人模式转向多人模式，从仅仅是一个**专业消费者**（proumer: 介于专业用户和普通消费者之间的用户，对产品有较高要求但并非专业开发者）工具转向商业应用。我认为我们必须赢得这样做的权利。而且，你知道，我认为对于商业用例来说，还有很多事情，从你的服务条款到安全隐私，再到你是否能与我的同事和共同工作者实时协作，这些都是对我们来说非常重要的约束，需要实际构建和交付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're going from the sort of single player to multiplayer mode, going from just being a proumer tool to being a business application. And I think we've had to earn the right to be able to do so. And you know I think that just there's a ton more that you know for for a business use case where everything from you know even your terms of service to security privacy to you know can I actually collaborate in real time with my my colleagues and co-workers these are all pretty you know um meaningful uh you know constraints for us to actually build like actually uh deliver on and so we've worked a lot to actually be able to you know fulfill on that and uh as part of that we're also kind of expanding the aperture of what gamma even represents.</p>
</details>

所以我们付出了很多努力来实际实现这一点，作为其中的一部分，我们也在扩大**Gamma**所代表的范围。我们也在，你知道，发布一项API业务，我认为这是第一次，你知道，除了服务最终用户，我们还可以服务那些希望在**Gamma**之上进行构建的企业和开发者。所以对我们来说，这是一个激动人心的时刻，我认为对于一家迄今为止都相当直接、你知道，易于理解的企业来说，我们将能够增加复杂性，因为我们将有许多不同的方式来服务许多不同类型的用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're also, you know, releasing an API business where I do think for the first time, you know, in addition to just serving end users, we can serve businesses and developers that want to build on top of gamma. So for us, it's just like an exciting moment in time where I think for a business that has, you know, up until now been pretty straightforward, like pretty uh, you know, easy to understand, I think we'll be able to add sort of complexity in the in the sense that like we're going to have many different ways we can serve many different types of users.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，绝对。我实际上想谈谈API部分，因为我觉得每当提到“代理”这个词时，它就会吸引所有注意力，但是，嗯，但这实际上让我想起了我们的一次**CRO**（CRO: Chief Revenue Officer，首席营收官）晚宴，很多CRO都谈到使用**Gamma**制作销售演示文稿。如果你考虑到连接你的数据存储（也许是**CRM**（CRM: Customer Relationship Management，客户关系管理系统）等）的能力，将其中的内容和想法传达出去并付诸行动，这是一个非常非常强大的概念。嗯，您在用户中看到了哪些类似的循环示例，这些循环又启发了API产品？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, absolutely. And I want to actually touch on the API piece of it because I feel like whenever there's an a the word agent thrown in that gets all the attention, but um but I actually this this hearkens back to a a CRO dinner that we had where a lot of CRO's talked about using Gamma for sales decks. And if you think about the ability to connect your data stores, maybe it's a CRM, etc. to communicating what's in them and sort of the ideas and getting that to action, that's a very very powerful concept. um what is sort of what are some examples of loops like that that you've seen among your users and sort of inspired the API product?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，完全正确。所以很多早期的请求都是，你知道，建立在我们专业消费者用户群的基础上，你知道，专业消费者，他们中的许多人已经在使用像**Zapier**（Zapier: 一个自动化工作流程的在线工具）和**Make**（Make: 以前称为Integromat，也是一个自动化工作流程的平台）这样的工具，现在我们可以连接他们已经使用的工具。所以假设你正在使用**Granola**（Granola: 可能是指一个笔记或会议记录工具，具体未详）来记录你所有的笔记，嗯，你的会议，你知道，如果你是使用**Gamma**的人，假设你正在用它来与你的客户和合作伙伴沟通，你正在与客户开会，会议一结束，你就可以把**Granola**中的所有内容导入，基本上创建一个精美的演示文稿，总结所有讨论主题、所有行动项目、可交付成果和所有后续步骤，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, totally. So a lot of the early requests were you know just building on the foundation of our proumer user base you know proumers u many of them are using already using you know tools like zapier make and now we can connect you know the tools they're already using so let's say you're using granola for you know all of your notes um you're meeting you know if you're if you're um someone that uses gamma let's say you're you're using it as a way to communicate to your clients and and partners and you're sitting with a client the moment the meeting's over you can feed everything from granola into basically creating um a beautiful presentation that recaps all of the discussion topics, recaps all the action items, the deliverables and all the next steps, right?</p>
</details>

所以会议一结束，你知道，客户的收件箱里就会有那份精美的演示文稿，一份精美的PDF，他们就会确切地知道，你知道，嗯，基本上，你知道，会议期间发生了什么，达成了什么协议，他们会感觉很好，因为他们觉得你倾听了，并且能够真正履行作为他们好伙伴的职责。在市场推广方面，我们看到，就你所说的，能够与**CRM**集成，或者，你知道，在某些情况下，你知道，人们正在使用像**Endgame**（Endgame: 可能是指一个销售智能工具，具体未详）这样的销售智能工具，其中有很多信息可以导入到演示文稿中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so soon as the meeting's end, you know, is over in their inbox, the client has that beautiful presentation, a beautiful PDF and they know exactly, you know, uh, basically, you know, what happened during the meeting and what was agreed upon and they feel good because they feel like you listened and are able to really fulfill being a good partner for them. on the sort of you know go to market side we see um to your point you know being able to integrate with CRM or um you know in some some cases you know there people are using you know sales intelligence tools like endgame where you know a lot of that information uh is there that can be pulled into a presentation.</p>
</details>

所以如果你想为特定的客户个性化市场研究或客户研究演示文稿，你也可以通过超自动化方式做到这一点，我们认为这将非常强大。然后我认为在**B2B**（B2B: Business-to-Business，企业对企业）方面，实际上我们对两种不同的用例非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you want to personalize you know a market research or like a customer research deck for a specific client or customer you you can also do that on a super automated basis and we think that's going to be super powerful and then I I think on the B2B uh side, there's actually two different um use cases that we're super excited about.</p>
</details>

一个是用像**Glean**（Glean: 一款企业知识管理和搜索工具）这样的合作伙伴，它位于公司知识和第一方数据之上，在内部，你知道，我们可以成为他们的视觉讲故事层。所以，你需要为**季度业务回顾**（QBR: Quarterly Business Review，季度业务回顾会议）或战略会议做准备。你知道，拉取你已有的所有信息，并创建演示文稿，这样每个人都可以达成共识。我们认为这也将是，你知道，谁愿意花时间格式化**PowerPoint**，当你可以在**Gamma**中自动创建时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One is like being able to partner with someone like Glean who sits on top of company knowledge, first-party data where internally, you know, we can be their visual storytelling layer. So, you have to prepare for a QBR or a strategy session. You know, pull all the information you already have and create that deck so everybody can be on the same page. We think that's going to be also just like, you know, who wants to spend time formatting the PowerPoint when you can just have that automatically created in gamma.</p>
</details>

然后我认为在开发者方面，我们已经开始与，你知道，像，嗯，正在构建房地产应用的人交谈，嗯，他们希望他们的最终用户能够，你知道，当他们进入产品并搜索特定的邮政编码或区域时，你知道，他们希望能够向用户提供该市场中所有可用房屋的目录或列表。而且，嗯，他们现在可以向最终用户发送一份精美的品牌PDF。他们不想自己构建这些，对吧？我们可以成为他们的内容基础设施，以一种与他们实际的房地产应用非常互补的方式，并为他们提供，你知道，幕后的所有这些好处，这些好处再次让他们可以拥有这个，你知道，现在这个内容引擎为他们运行，所有这些都建立在**Gamma**之上，随着**Gamma**变得更好，即使在专业消费者方面，产品也变得更好，其他一切也变得更好，对吧？API变得更强大、更有效，然后它可以服务更多的用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I think on the developer side, this is where we're already starting to talk to, you know, folks like, um, someone building a real estate app, uh, they want their end users to be able to, you know, when they go into their product and search a specific zip code or region, you know, they want to be able to give their users, you know, directory or listing of all the available homes in that market. And, uh, they can have now a beautiful branded PDF sent to that end user. And they don't want to have to build that, right? we can be their content infrastructure in a way that's very complimentary to their actual real estate app and provide them sort of you know the under the hood uh all this sort of goodness that again they can have this you know now this content engine running for them all built on top of gamma and as gamma gets better even on the proumer side that product gets better everything else gets better too right the API becomes more powerful more effective and it can then serve even more use cases</p>
</details>

### 增长秘诀：口碑与创始人营销

>> 听到您讲述1.0、2.0、3.0的发布过程真是太棒了。您的团队一直以来都是令人难以置信的清晰和直观的产品构建者。但我相信，随着用户数量达到数千万乃至现在的数亿，您会收到很多请求。您如何考虑构建哪些是人们渴望的，不构建哪些？您如何做出这些权衡？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it's amazing hearing you walk through like the 1.0 2.0 3.0 When I launched, your team has always been incredibly I think clear and intuitive product builders. But I'm sure with tens and now in the hundreds of millions of users, you get a lot of requests. Like how do you think about what do you build that people are clamoring for? What do you not build? Like how do you make those tradeoffs?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这确实变得越来越难。所以它总是在平衡你自己的直觉，即你认为市场中存在巨大差距或机会的地方。我们还有许多不同的来源，我们试图，你知道，显然只是保持良好的脉搏，然后尝试整合所有这些。所以其中之一是，我们有一个公共的**Canny**（Canny: 一款用于收集用户反馈和管理产品路线图的工具）看板，任何人都可以提交未来的想法和请求，人们可以投票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's it's definitely becoming increasingly hard. So it's always balancing your sort of own intuition for where you think there's big gaps or opportunities in the market. We also have just many different um sources where we try to you know obviously try to just have a good pulse and then and then and then try to consolidate all that. So one is like we have a public cany board where anybody can submit future ideas requests people can upvote.</p>
</details>

我们为我们的**高级用户**（power users: 指对产品使用频率高、深度参与的用户）设有一个单独的**Slack**（Slack: 一款团队协作和即时通讯工具）群组。我们称之为**Gamb**（Gamb: 可能是Gamma内部对高级用户群的昵称）。所以，我们把他们都放在那里，而且，嗯，这是一个很好的地方，我可以获得实时反馈，因为我们经常展示早期概念、线框图或其他任何东西，并说：“嘿，这是否完全偏离了目标，或者这里有什么有趣的东西？”所以，你可以从那里获得一些非常关键和诚实的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have for our power users a separate sort of slack group. We call it the gamb. So, we throw them all there and uh it's a great place for me to get real-time feedback because often times we're kind of showcasing early concepts, wireframes, whatever it may be, and saying, "Hey, is this even like, you know, is this completely missing the mark or is there something interesting here?" And so, you get some really critical and honest feedback from there.</p>
</details>

然后我们非常喜欢**内部测试**（dog fooding: 指公司员工自己使用和测试自家产品），所以，你知道，每周我们都会有一个叫做**Gamarama**（Gamarama: 可能是Gamma内部的演示分享活动）的活动，公司里的任何人都可以就任何话题制作一个有趣的演示文稿，比如向我们介绍一些东西。它可以是一个爱好，也可以是你真正相信的东西，在每次**Gamarama**结束时，你会谈论你所有的痛点，产品的所有缺点。所以，你知道，总而言之，有很多不同的输入，然后我们尝试定期地堆叠我们认为最重要的东西，并尝试将其推入路线图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we're extreme like dog foodters around product. And so, you know, every week we we have um we have something called Gamarama where every anybody at the company can create a fun presentation on any topic like educate us on on something. It could be a hobby, it could be a you know, something you really believe in and at the end of every gamarama, you talk about all the sort of pain points you have, all the shortcomings of the product. M so you know all to say is like multiple different sort of sort of inputs into that and then we try on a very regular basis to kind of stack create what we think is going to be most important and try to push that into onto the road map.</p>
</details>

我实际上想稍微转换一下话题，谈谈增长本身。嗯，接近1亿用户的疯狂之处不仅在于庞大的数字，还在于你们主要是通过**有机渠道**（organic channels: 指通过非付费方式获取用户或流量的渠道，如口碑、搜索引擎优化等）做到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually want to switch gears a little bit to growth itself. And um the crazy thing about approaching 100 million users is not only the sheer number, but the fact that you've done through you've done so predominantly through organic channels. Um and so</p>
</details>

>> 我们很希望，我相信很多听众都会对你们是怎么做到的感兴趣。嗯，哪些渠道对你们来说最有效？我必须补充一点，我不知道您是否会提到这个渠道，但我对您的**Instagram**（Instagram: 一个社交媒体平台，主要用于分享照片和视频）内容印象深刻。我是一个千禧一代，我一直在用**Instagram**，我与您的内容互动，偶尔当我点赞时，我会注意到它已经有8万个赞了。嗯，所以非常好奇这是如何膨胀、扩展的，以及你们如何将社区融入到这项工作中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> we'd love for the I'm sure a lot of folks um out there listening would be interested in how the heck did you guys do that? Um what channels have been the most effective for you? And I do have to throw in there, I don't know if you're going to say this channel, but I've been very impressed by your Instagram content. I'm a millennial and I'm on Instagram all the time and I engage with your content and occasionally when I go to like it, I'll notice it has 80,000 likes already. Um and and so very curious how this ballooned, expanded, and how you guys um bring the community into the effort.</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。嗯，我的意思是，我将从我的建议开始，对于大多数早期阶段的创始人，你知道，当他们接近或可能，你知道，达到**产品市场契合**（product-market fit: 指产品满足了足够大的市场需求，并能持续增长的状态）时，我总是建议他们关注的第一件事是**口碑**（word of mouth: 指通过人际传播而非广告宣传来推广产品或服务）。你必须构建一个拥有强大口碑的产品，当这种情况发生时，其他一切都会变得容易得多，不要自欺欺人地认为你已经达到了产品市场契合，直到你拥有强大的口碑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Um I mean I'll start by just you know what my piece of advice for most early stage founders you know as they're approaching or maybe you know getting to product market fit the number one thing I always advise them to focus on is word of mouth like you have to build a product that has strong word of mouth everything else becomes so much easier when that's the case and don't fool yourself into thinking of product market fit until you have strong word of mouth um and so we really did try to get that right in the very beginning you know we had a few sort of uh launch moments early on where you know we launched on product hunt and we had ended up winning you know product of the day, product of the week, product of the month and it felt good and then we looked at the signups and initially huge see this huge spike in signups and then they sort of sort of plateau out and we're still bringing in new users but it was very clear we didn't have strong organic virality like something wasn't working on the sort of fundamental level and so we had to go back and say okay you know we you know at that point in time we could have said okay maybe let's just throw much more money at top of the funnel, like advertise a whole bunch, like run massive influencer campaigns.</p>
</details>

嗯，所以我们确实在最初就努力做对了这一点，你知道，我们早期有几个发布时刻，你知道，我们在**Product Hunt**（Product Hunt: 一个发现和分享新产品的平台）上发布，最终赢得了当日产品、本周产品、本月产品，感觉很好。然后我们查看了注册量，最初看到注册量大幅飙升，然后就趋于平稳，我们仍然在引入新用户，但很明显我们没有强大的**有机病毒式传播**（organic virality: 指产品或服务通过用户自发分享和推荐而实现快速传播和增长）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think we would have fooled ourselves into thinking, you know, we could just continue to grow and and that would be fine. We'll just spend our way out of the problem. Um, but I think we gave ourselves an honest look. It's like, no, that's that the core growth engine is broken. So before we do any of that, let's make sure we do have strong word of mouth. So we ended up spending, you know, 3 to four months leading up to our first AI launch, the entire team just focused on one thing. We are going to nail the first 30 seconds of the product experience. We're going to make sure that every new user coming in has the sort of a chance of like seeing the aha moment such that they will go on and you know tell their friends, colleagues, family about this product and I think the moment we launched you know all of a sudden you see you know what took us basically 8 months to get to 60,000 signups within a few days we we surpassed that and then we'd have like you know 25,000 signups a day 45,000 signups a 50,000 signups a day it just kept on going up right and we weren't doing any advertising. We weren't doing any marketing and it was just all organic pull of people are using product telling others about it sharing it with others.</p>
</details>

就像某种根本层面的东西没有起作用，所以我们不得不回去说，好吧，你知道，我们，你知道，当时我们本可以说，好吧，也许我们应该在漏斗顶部投入更多的钱，比如大量广告，进行大规模的**网红营销活动**（influencer campaigns: 指与有影响力的个人合作，通过他们的社交媒体等渠道推广产品或服务）。我认为我们会自欺欺人地认为，你知道，我们可以继续增长，那会没问题。我们会花钱解决问题。嗯，但我认为我们诚实地审视了自己。就像，不，核心增长引擎坏了。所以在做任何这些之前，让我们确保我们确实有强大的口碑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's where we felt like okay we we're on a path where if we can just continue doing that everything else is amplification on top of that you as a founding then can actually say okay where might we augment like and actually accelerate the growth and I think doing so before that would have been premature but like doing that at that moment then you have like more of this like massive tailwind to support you and everything else. So that's like fundamental like do that and then I think there's many apps out there today that are you know very much more proumer in nature and so you have you know this you know a growing base of users it's often times hard for a founder because you go from this point where you know every user to the user base being this sort of faceless like entity like like who is even my user I I don't know</p>
</details>

所以我们最终花了，你知道，三到四个月的时间，在我们的第一次AI发布之前，整个团队只专注于一件事。我们将把产品体验的最初30秒做到极致。我们将确保每个新用户都有机会看到**“啊哈时刻”**（aha moment: 指用户在使用产品时突然领悟到其价值和好处的关键时刻），这样他们就会去，你知道，告诉他们的朋友、同事、家人关于这个产品。我认为当我们发布的那一刻，你知道，突然之间，你看到，你知道，我们花了基本上8个月才达到6万注册用户，在几天之内我们就超过了这个数字，然后我们每天有2.5万、4.5万、5万注册用户，它只是不断上升，对吧？我们没有做任何广告。我们没有做任何营销，这完全是人们使用产品、告诉别人、与别人分享的有机拉动。

<p class="english-text">And that's where we felt like okay we we're on a path where if we can just continue doing that everything else is amplification on top of that you as a founding then can actually say okay where might we augment like and actually accelerate the growth and I think doing so before that would have been premature but like doing that at that moment then you have like more of this like massive tailwind to support you and everything else.

</details>

那就是我们觉得，好吧，我们走上了一条道路，如果我们能继续这样做，其他一切都只是在此基础上的放大。作为创始人，你就可以说，好吧，我们可以在哪里增强并实际加速增长。我认为在此之前这样做会过早，但在那一刻这样做，你就会有这种巨大的顺风来支持你和其他一切。所以这是根本性的，做到这一点。然后我认为今天有很多应用，你知道，本质上更偏向专业消费者，所以你有一个不断增长的用户群，对于创始人来说，这通常很难，因为你从每个用户都认识到用户群变成这种无形的实体，就像我的用户是谁，我不知道。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's where we felt like okay we we're on a path where if we can just continue doing that everything else is amplification on top of that you as a founding then can actually say okay where might we augment like and actually accelerate the growth and I think doing so before that would have been premature but like doing that at that moment then you have like more of this like massive tailwind to support you and everything else.

>> 所以，你知道，我认为你的许多听众可能都熟悉，你知道，**创始人销售**（founder sales: 指初创公司创始人亲自参与销售，以获取早期客户和市场反馈）作为一个重要的概念，但如果你是销售B2B产品，你可能需要这样做。你需要成为第一个知道如何讲述你的产品故事的人，然后最终能够培训和指导你的**客户经理**（AEES: Account Executives，客户经理）。嗯，我认为在这个时代，拥有**创始人营销**（founder marketing: 指创始人利用个人品牌和影响力直接向市场推广产品和公司）非常重要。比如，你如何以引人入胜的方式广泛讲述你的故事，以一种真正，你知道，理解产品以及它在世界上为何重要的方式，嗯，然后在这种情况下，像，你知道，它属于品牌建设的一部分，你必须在开始时专注于此，我认为，再次，然后其他一切都会变得更容易一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and so uh you know I think uh a lot of your audience is probably familiar with you know founder sales as like an important concept but you're selling B2B like you probably need to do that. You need to be the first person to kind of know how to tell the story of your product, be able to then eventually train and onboard your your AEES. Um I think in this era it's really important to have founder marketing. like how do you tell your story broadly in a way that is compelling, a way that really kind of is is is uh understands like the product and why it matters in the world and um and then and in this case like be so close to everything that that is uh you know it's part of like brand building like you have to be laser focused on that in the beginning and I think again then everything else becomes a little bit easier.</p>
</details>

有时，像**Gamma**这样横向的产品，如果你不非常小心地设计定价，**货币化**（monetization: 指将产品或服务转化为收入的过程）可能会阻碍增长。你的许多用户可能是学生或其他最终可能会付费的人，但他们可能会使用**Gamma**数月甚至数年而不付费。您如何考虑设置**付费墙**（paywall: 指限制访问内容或功能，要求用户付费才能使用的机制）以及如何设计定价？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes there are products that are as horizontal as Gamma is. Monetization can get in the way of growth if you're not very careful about how you design pricing. And a lot of your users are maybe students or other people who eventually might pay, but they might use Gamma for months or years without paying. Like how do you think about where you put the payw wall and how you design the pricing?</p>
</details>

### 定价策略与盈利之路

>> 是的，我的意思是，这绝对是一个，你知道，目前更多是艺术而非科学。嗯，所以我们处理它的方式是，你知道，当我们最终进行第一次大型AI发布时，你知道，注册量飙升，嗯，我们没有构建任何东西，所以所有人都在努力构建最初的30秒，我们在货币化方面零投入，所以我们甚至无法向人们收取产品费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean this is one where it's definitely, you know, um probably more art than science at this point. Um and so the way we approached it was you know when we ended up doing our first big AI launch you know signups were going you know through the roof um we hadn't built any so all hands on.com building the first you know 30 seconds we had built we had zero effort on the monetization piece so we actually couldn't even charge people for the product.</p>
</details>

>> 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wow</p>
</details>

>> 而且，嗯，**Intercom**（Intercom: 一款客户消息和支持平台）上充斥着人们说“我的积分用完了，我怎么购买更多？”这是一个非常合理的问题。我们没有一个好的答案。我们当时想，好吧，是的，我想我们需要去弄清楚定价。所以我们最终在四月份，嗯，基本上写了一些初步的定价研究。我们做了，你知道，经典的**Van Westendorp**（Van Westendorp: 一种市场研究方法，用于确定消费者对产品价格的接受范围）。我们广泛地研究了，嗯，你知道，其他产品是如何定价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and uh intercom was blowing up with people saying I ran out of credits and like how do I how do I purchase more? It was a very fair question. We didn't have an a good answer to that. We're like okay yeah I guess we need to go figure out pricing. So we ended up spending you know all of April um basically writing some initial pricing studies. We did, you know, classic sort of Van Wondonor. We looked broadly at like what was um, you know, how other products were pricing.</p>
</details>

我认为，你知道，在所有这些不同的数据点中，最终的结论是，这部分只是，你知道，在当下这个时刻，每个人都熟悉**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）的定价，他们已经以此为锚点。所以你可以非常复杂地定价，但这会给人们购买产品的方式增加很多摩擦。所以我们最终采用了与**ChatGPT**最初定价类似的方式，我们认为这是一个很好的起点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think, you know, amongst like all these different data points, the conclusion end up being like part of this is just, you know, in this moment in time, everyone's familiar with chatbt's pricing and they're kind of already anchored on that. And so you can kind of get very sophisticated how you want to price it, but that adds a lot of friction into like how people want to purchase a product. And so we ultimately landed something similar to kind of how chatbt was pricing initially just as we thought as a good starting point.</p>
</details>

我们至少让人们能够购买**Gamma**，然后我们想看看数据，对吧？这个模型对我们来说是否真的经济。我们能用那个价位赚钱吗？幸运的是，我们做到了。我们从一个点出发，你知道，我们的AI发布确实是**押注公司**（bet the company: 指公司将所有资源和未来押注在一个项目或决策上）的时刻，因为我们只有大约12个月的**运营资金**（runway: 指公司在不获得额外资金的情况下，能够维持运营的时间），你知道，作为一家初创公司，如果前景不确定，这不是一个好情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's just at least allow people to purchase gamma and then we wanted to then see the data right is this a model that was actually economical for us. could we make money with that price point? And fortunately for us, we were we went from a point where, you know, our AI launch was was really kind of the sort of bet the company moment because we were about 12 months of runway, which, you know, as a startup is not a great place to be if especially if there's uncertainty ahead.</p>
</details>

所以当我们发布定价和套餐时，我们花了大约3个月的时间才达到100万美元的年度经常性收入，然后实现盈利。所以，你知道，对我们来说，感觉就像，好吧，我们不需要改变太多，因为至少我们知道核心的**单位经济效益**（unit economics: 指产品或服务在单个用户或单位层面上的收入和成本）是有效的，至少在这个阶段是这样，我们将继续监控它，然后我们将更多地关注产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the moment we launched pricing and packaging, it took us about 3 months to get to like 1 million AR and then become profitable. So it was you know for us it felt like okay well we don't need to change much because at least we know the core you know unit economics work at least at this stage and we're going to continue to monitor it and then we'll focus more on the product.</p>
</details>

我认为如果我们发布了，而且，你知道，事情正在运作，但我们实际上正在消耗大量现金，而且那12个月的运营资金实际上正在更快地减少，那么我们肯定会不得不重新审视那个决定。嗯，幸运的是，我们不必在早期这样做，而且我们实际上在两年多的时间里都没有触及定价。最近我们推出了一些新的计划，但从根本上说，最初的设计或多或少保持不变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if we had launched and like you know things were working but we're actually burning a lot of cash and like that 12-month runway is actually going down even faster then we definitely would have had to revisit that decision. Uh fortunately for us that wasn't one we had to do early on and we actually really haven't touched pricing in you know two plus years. more recently we introduced a few new plans but fundamentally the the initial kind of design uh more or less has been the same.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。嗯，顺便说一句，我喜欢您关于增长的说法。这让我想起，我认为您最近在一次采访中说过这样一句话：战略是在人们喜欢的产品上建立业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well um by the way I love what you were saying about growth. It reminds me I think you had this quote in an interview recently where you said strategy is building a business on a product people love.</p>
</details>

>> 这种简单和清晰，嗯，你知道，我认为非常非常令人大开眼界，因为你真的可以把它归结为这一点。嗯，也许只是，嗯，就从消费者/专业消费者开始这一点。嗯，我们谈到了推出团队计划。嗯，很好奇您如何看待跨越鸿沟进入企业市场以及更广泛的B2B用户。感觉可能已经有很多吸引力了，仅仅是因为您的一些用户出于个人原因使用您，然后他们将您带入工作中。但也许多谈谈这一点，以及您何时以及如何决定推出这个计划的时机，以及，嗯，你知道，何时是合适的时机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Just the simplicity and clarity of that was um you know I think very very eye opening actually because you can really boil it down to that. Um maybe just uh to this point on starting consumer proumer. Um we talked about launching the teams plan. Um curious how you think about crossing the chasm to the enterprise um and B2B users more generally. It feels like there's probably been a lot of pull already just because some of your users use you for personal reasons and then they bring you into work. But maybe talk more about that and when did how did you decide on the timing of when to launch this plan and um you know when the when the time was right.</p>
</details>

### 从消费者到企业：跨越鸿沟

>> 完全正确。是的，我的意思是，我们非常关注，你知道，**排序**（sequencing: 指在产品开发或市场拓展中，按照特定顺序进行各项工作），如果你能做到，就为自己设定成功的基础，这就是我们认为像我们这样的产品应该从专业消费者优先开始的地方。你希望在尝试B2B的推动或销售流程之前，先建立大量的**自下而上的喜爱**（bottoms-up love: 指产品通过个人用户自发使用和喜爱，逐渐在组织内部传播和获得认可）。我看到很多初创公司试图同时做这两件事。我确实认为这很棘手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Yeah. I mean we think a lot about you know sequencing like set yourself up for success if you can and that's where proumer first is the for in our minds kind of you know where you want to start for a product like ours. You want to build a lot of bottoms up love before you even attempt like the B2B you know emotion or like that sales process. I see a lot of startups try to do both simultaneously. I do think that's tricky.</p>
</details>

某些类别也许你可以做到，但如果你能从专业消费者开始，并建立这种自下而上的喜爱，比如人们认识品牌，他们学会信任品牌，然后当你实际向公司销售时，已经有一些内部支持者希望你成功。这总是容易得多。而且，就像我们开始感受到这一点的那一刻，就像，好吧，我们觉得我们实际上可以开始这个过程，并进入这种B2B的推动，那里已经有一些顺风，对吧？我们有一些势头，我们不是冷启动，我们不是完全冷启动地进入这个市场，所以那是我们寻找的早期信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some categories maybe you can execute on that but if you can start with the proumer side and build that sort of bottoms up love like people recognize the the brand they learn to trust the brand and then when you're finally actually selling into a company there's already some like internal champions that want you to win. That's always way easier. And like the moment we started feeling that was the moment was like okay we feel like we can actually start this process and going into this this sort of B2 motion where there's already some tailwinds right we have some momentum we're not like a cold start we're not just going into this completely cold and so that was the sort of early signals we're looking for.</p>
</details>

然后我们不想仓促行事。所以，你花了很多时间与这些用户交谈，比如他们的主要摩擦点是什么。嗯，这就是我们开始认识到这可能只是这个时刻的独特之处，但对于许多企业来说，他们正在寻找解锁AI生产力的方法，为他们的公司，对吧？嗯，除了**ChatGPT**之外，还有哪些工具是公司里每个人都可以使用的，可以让他们熟悉AI的力量，其他员工可以培训其他员工。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we didn't want to rush into it. So like then you spend a lot of time talking to those users like what are their main points of friction. Um, this is where we started recognizing that this might be just unique into this moment in time, but the the sort of uh for many businesses, they're they're looking for ways to unlock AI productivity and for their for their companies, right? Um, what are tools that go beyond just chat GPT that everybody at the company can use that can familiarize themselves with like the power of AI where other, you know, employees can train other employees.</p>
</details>

碰巧的是，幻灯片是其中一种格式，几乎公司里的每个人都在非常频繁地使用。所以现在我们正在进行对话，不仅有自下而上的喜爱，还有自上而下的需求，我们需要明天就能有东西来帮助，你知道，真正教育我们广泛的员工基础。我认为这两者结合在一起，你知道，希望会让我们更容易地进入那个市场，以一种不像是推着一块巨大的石头上山的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it just so happens like slides is one of the formats where like everybody almost everybody at the company is is using on a very regular basis. And so now now we're having the conversation where not only is there the bottoms up love, there's a top down like demand for we need something tomorrow to help you know really you know educate our our broad employee base. And I think those two together you know hopefully will make it just easier for us to kind of you know enter that market in a way where it doesn't feel like just pushing this massive boulder up a hill.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我对您所说的自下而上的用户喜爱非常感兴趣，因为我认为这是每家公司都渴望的，但你无法，你知道，制造它。它只是自然发生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I'm really interested in what you said about the kind of bottoms up user love because I think that's something every company aspires to but you can't, you know, manufacture it. It just happens.</p>
</details>

>> 对。对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. Right.</p>

### 网络效应与品牌建设

>> 在多大程度上，这成为了你们的**复合优势**（compounding advantage: 指随着时间的推移，优势不断积累和增强，产生超线性增长）？比如，当用户数量达到数千万时，是否有任何**飞轮效应**（flywheels: 指一个良性循环的商业模式，通过一系列相互关联的环节，驱动业务持续增长）开始运转？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> To to what extent has that been like a a compounding advantage for you? Like is are there any flywheels that kind of get going as you get users in the tens of millions?</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。是的，你知道，我认为，你知道，初创公司经常被问到**防御性**（defensibility: 指公司抵御竞争对手的能力）或**持久性**（durability: 指公司长期保持竞争优势的能力）意味着什么？我认为，你知道，初创公司构建防御性有很多种方式。嗯，会发生某种形式的**网络效应**（network effects: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量的增加而增加的现象）。嗯，然后当然，品牌作为一种**护城河**（moat: 指公司相对于竞争对手的持久竞争优势）在网络效应方面。你知道，我们没有任何，我想说，你知道，当谈到真正的直接网络效应时，不像社交平台，但我们确实有这种**局部网络效应**（local network effect: 指网络效应在特定群体或区域内发生，而非全局性）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Yeah. You know, I think you know, oftentimes startups get asked like what does defensibility mean or durability? And I think there's, you know, many ways for a startup to build, you know, defensibility. Um there's some form of network effects that happens. Um and then there's certainly like brand as a mode on the network effect side. you know we don't have any I would say you know when it comes to like true direct network effect so not like a social platform but we do have this sort of local network effect that happens where</p>
</details>

当你有这种自下而上的喜爱时，会发生什么呢？你会让用户教其他用户如何使用**Gamma**，对吧？所以每个新增用户，几乎都有一个**社会认同**（social proof: 指人们倾向于模仿他人的行为，尤其是在不确定时）的方面。嗯，最终会发生什么呢？你成为一个标准，你成为一种每个人都想在内部学习的语言，这变成了一件非常强大的事情。我认为类似的事情也发生在像**Cursor**（Cursor: 可能是指一款代码编辑器或协作工具，具体未详）这样的工具上，你成为标准，就像，好吧，是的，毫无疑问。我们只会使用**Cursor**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you do have that bottoms up love what happens is you have users that are teaching other users how to use gamma right so every incremental user there's almost a social proof aspect of it and um what ends up happening is you become a standard you become a language that everybody internally wants to learn and that becomes a very powerful thing I think similar things happen with, you know, tools like cursor where like you become the standard and it's like, okay, yeah, no-brainer. We're just going to use cursor, right?</p>
</details>

所以，我认为你只有通过拥有这种自下而上的喜爱才能赢得这一点。然后，当然，回到品牌方面，你知道，如果你在一个类别中是**首选品牌**（top of mind: 指当人们想到某个产品类别时，首先想到的品牌），当任何人、任何时候提到AI演示文稿时，他们只能想到**Gamma**，那对我们来说，显然是一个很棒的位置。所以对我们来说，我们想成为那样。你只有通过，当然，一次又一次地建立品牌知名度，并长期投入其中才能赢得这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think you only earn that by having some of that bottoms up love. And then, of course, going back to the brand piece of it, you know, if you are top of mind for a category, when anybody and anytime anybody says AI presentations and all they can think of is gamma, that that's a great, you know, obviously a great place to be be for us. And so for us, we want to be that. You can only earn that by of of course like building that brand awareness over and over again and uh being invested in doing so over a long time horizon.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。是的。绝对。我想，就协作而言，嗯，您不一定会称之为网络效应，但您可以如此轻松地分享**Gamma**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And I guess to the point on collaboration, um you wouldn't necessarily call this a network effect, but the fact that you can share gamas so easily. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 这是一个巨大的优势。我知道我们内部一直在分享，但这让我想起了**Figma**（Figma: 一款基于云的协作式界面设计工具），以及，你知道，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> is a huge advantage. which I know we share with internally all the time, but it reminds me a bit of Figma um and how, you know,</p>
</details>

>> 它们随着时间的推移取代了电子邮件，就发送PDF格式而言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> they sort of replaced email over time in terms of sending um that PDF format.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我的意思是，当我们，你知道，刚开始的时候，我们基本上只有两个口号：让创建变得极其简单，让分享变得极其简单。如果你做到这一点，你就完成了飞轮。所以，是的，我们希望从一开始就确保是这样。你通过设计来构建这种有机病毒式传播，并确保，显然你必须改进所有东西，但是，嗯，这必须是你处理它的根本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, I mean, when we, you know, when we were just getting started, we basically just had two mantras. Make it dead simple to create, dead simple to share. Like if you do that, you complete the flywheel. And so, yeah, we wanted to make sure that was the case from the very beginning. you build for that organic virality by design and make sure like obviously you have to improve everything but um that needs to be fundamental to how you approach it.</p>
</details>

### 公司文化与招聘哲学

>> 是的，喜欢这一点。这实际上可能是一个很好的过渡，谈谈公司建设的整体情况。嗯，关于**Gamma**有很多传说，就你们如何以不同的方式构建这家公司而言，特别是考虑到你们是在2020年开始的。2020年和2021年的许多公司都是以非常不同的方式构建的。嗯，它们通常很早就变得臃肿。嗯，我认为这与您、**John**和**James**构建**Gamma**的方式截然相反。嗯，您能多谈谈你们早期秉持的这些原则吗？听起来，你知道，您在产品方面分享了一些。嗯，但**Gamma**的文化也非常重要且独特。我听说您谈论过拥有这种**实时文化手册**（live culture deck: 指一份不断更新和演进的公司文化指南或演示文稿）。嗯，多谈谈你们是如何想出这个的。今天这份文化手册里有什么，在您能分享的范围内？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, love that. And actually that's probably a good segue into company building overall. Um and there's a lot of lore around gamma in terms of just how you've built this company a bit differently, especially given the fact that you start in 2020. A lot of companies in 2020 and 2021 were were built very differently. Um often times they got bloated pretty early on. uh which is I think is pretty antithetical to how you and John and James built Gamma. Um can you say more about these kind of principles you had in the early days? It sound you know you shared a little bit on the product side. Um but the culture of Gamma was also very important distinct. I've heard you talk about having this live culture deck. Um say more about like how you guys came up with that. What's in that culture deck today to the extent you can share?</p>
</details>

>> 是的。是的，完全正确。所以，嗯，你知道，我们一直努力坚持的几个原则是，我们从一开始就有一个内部口号，那就是“招聘要痛苦地慢”。即使在我们取得了巨大增长之后，我们仍然坚持这个原则，这让我们在取得如此大的**牵引力**（traction: 指初创公司在市场中获得的用户、收入或增长势头）的情况下，仍然保持相对精简。但我想最重要的是，你知道，当我们刚开始的时候，我们考虑了最初的核心团队，我们实际上有七八个人都来自**Optimizely**（Optimizely: 一家提供A/B测试和实验优化平台的公司）。嗯，我们已经一起工作了五年多。对我们来说，你知道，已经有了信任的基础，但我们真正考虑的是，我们希望最初的七个人。我们把他们看作是我们的**最小可行团队**（MVP crew: Minimum Viable Product crew，指能够从头到尾交付一个最小可行产品所需的最小团队）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah totally. Yeah. So um you know a couple of of principles that I think you know we've tried to stay true to we had this internal mantra around hire painfully slowly from from the very beginning and even as we hit you know a lot of growth we we still have stay true to that so it's allowed us to maintain relatively lean given our traction but I think most importantly you know when we first started we thought about the initial core team there there was uh seven or eight of us actually that all came from optimizely um and we had worked together for you know five plus years. And for us, you know, there was already the sort of foundation of trust, but what I what we really thought about was we wanted that initial, you know, seven of us. We we thought of that as like our MVP crew.</p>
</details>

>> 我们需要这个团队能够，嗯，从头到尾交付一个产品。所以我们可以创建产品。我们也可以，你知道，营销产品，然后对我来说，甚至可以销售产品，就像最初的七个人，我们希望他们都在那里，这样我们就能以极快的速度前进。那么在实践中是怎样的呢？我作为联合创始人之一，**John**是首席产品官兼联合创始人，**James**是首席技术官兼联合创始人。然后我们的第一个雇员是我们的设计主管，嗯，产品设计。我们的下一个雇员是我们的第一个前端工程师，然后我们雇佣了两名后端工程师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We needed that group to be um everything we needed to ship a product end to end. So we can create the product. We can also, you know, market the product and then for me be able to even sell the product like that that initial seven that's that that we wanted that to be there so that we would be able to move incredibly fast. So what did that look like in practice? me as uh one of the co-founders, John CPO co-founder, James CTO co-founder. Then our first hire was our head of design uh product design. Our next hire was our first front-end engineer and then we hired two backend engineers.</p>
</details>

所以再次回到，这支**最小可行团队**可以从头到尾构建产品，我们可以在过程中测试许多不同的想法，这让我们在第一年能够以极快的速度前进。嗯，我们不必，你知道，嗯，你知道，等待下一个雇员加入，我们拥有所需的一切，我认为这种基础，把最初的七个人做好，让我们拥有这种核心**DNA**（DNA: 指公司的核心价值观、文化和运营方式），嗯，我可以很容易地想象招聘接下来的七个人或十个人，并尝试复制这种DNA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so again going back to like this is the MVB crew that could to build end to end and we could test a lot of different ideas along the way and allowed us to move incredibly fast in that first year. um we didn't have to you know uh you know wait for the next hire to come aboard like we we had everything we needed and I think that sort of foundation getting that first seven right allowed us to have this core DNA where um I could easily imagine hiring the next seven or next 10 and just trying to replicate that DNA.</p>
</details>

我认为**Brian Chesky**（Brian Chesky: Airbnb的联合创始人兼CEO）谈到过这一点，就像你真的想把最初的十个人做好，或者，你知道，最初的一百个人做好，因为你试图做的是为下一批加入的人设定蓝图，这样他们都分享相同的价值观、相同的原则，希望有相同的抱负，然后一切都会变得更容易，对吧？就像如果你知道那个团队都团结在一起，一个充满希望的**传教士**（missionaries: 指对公司使命和愿景充满热情，并积极传播和实现的人）团队，任何事情都是可能的，所以对我们来说，把最初的七个人做好非常非常关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Brian Chesy talks about this where like you really want to get that first 10 right or you know first 100 right because what you're trying to do is like set the blueprint for the next set of folks that join so that they all share the same values same principles hopefully the same level of ambition for what you want to build and then everything becomes easier right like if you know that team is all in it together team full of hopefully missionaries that anything is possible and so for us getting that first seven right was really really critical.</p>
</details>

然后即使在那之后，像拥有“招聘要痛苦地慢”这个概念，只是让我们始终专注于我们引入的人的质量，而不是数量。有时当你达到，你知道，产品市场契合时，就会有这种诱惑，设定非常雄心勃勃的招聘目标。当你设定招聘目标时，招聘目标就变成了目标。目标就是达到那个目标。目标不再是招聘最好的人。所以我们一直都想知道，是的，我们需要成长。我们需要继续组建团队，但我们绝不会降低我们允许进入**Gamma**的门槛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then even after that like having this notion of hiring painfully slowly just allowed us to always focus on the the quality of of the people we're bringing in and not the quantity. Sometimes when you hit, you know, product market fit, there's this temptation to just set these really ambitious hiring targets. And when you set the hiring targets, the hiring target becomes the goal. And the goal is to hit that target. The target is no longer to hire the best people. And so we've always wanted to know like, yeah, we need to grow. We need to continue to build a team, but we're never going to lower the bar for who we let in, you know, into the door at Gamma.</p>
</details>

所以这始终是，你知道，我们最关心的事情。我们遇到过许多候选人，他们可能在技术上非常强大，或者在文化上非常契合，但他们不是两者兼备。如果他们不是两者兼备，那么他们就不是我们会在**Gamma**合作的人。这变得很困难，因为再次，诱惑总是，嘿，我们必须继续增长。你在这个增长飞轮上。你无法在不达到招聘目标的情况下实现这些。我认为这就是，如果你能尽力抵制这种诱惑，并忠于自己的核心原则，嗯，你知道，这让你有机会一次又一次地复制DNA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's always been, you know, top of mind. We've met many candidates that are maybe strong super technically or maybe good culturally a good fit but didn't but didn't weren't both. If they're not both, then they're not someone that we're going to, you know, work with a gamma. And it becomes hard because again, the temptation always is, hey, we have to keep growing. You're on this growth flywheel. You can't hit those without hitting the grow the hiring target. And I think that's the the part where if you can try your best to resist that temptation and be honest to your own core principles um you know that gives you a chance of actually replicating the DNA over and over.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。所以您说产品设计主管是第一位雇员，我们听说，我不知道这个数字是否正确，但您团队的25%是设计师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So you said the head of product design was hire number one and and we've heard I don't know if this number is right but 25% of your team is designers.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。在开始的时候，我认为现在稍微少一点，但有一段时间，是的，我们团队的四分之一是产品设计师，但我也认为这在初创公司中并不常见。而且，嗯，是的，对我们来说，我们非常关心，你知道，在很多方面，AI公司都在尝试发明新的**表面领域**（surface areas: 指产品或服务与用户交互的不同界面、功能或接触点）、新的用户体验。我认为如果没有一个真正强大的产品设计团队，这是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. In the in the beginning I think it's a little bit less now but for a while yeah it was a quarter of our team was product designers but I also don't think yeah is is common maybe amongst startups. And uh yeah, for us we cared a lot about you know in many ways AI companies are trying to invent new surface areas, new user experiences. I don't think that's possible without a really strong product design team.</p>
</details>

而且，嗯，**Zach**，嗯，他是我们的设计主管，你知道，他从一开始就和我们在一起。他今天仍然和我们在一起。我真的认为，是的，没有他，没有他能够真正深入理解用户试图完成什么，这非常重要，对吧？而且，嗯，我们很高兴我们在这个团队上投入了这么多。我认为对我们来说，这转化为希望更好的整体产品体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um you know Zach uh who's our head of design, you know, he's been with us since the beginning. He's still with us today. And I I honestly think yeah, without him and being able to really deeply understand what the user is trying to accomplish, that matters so much, right? And uh we're glad we invested so much uh in in that team. And I think for us it's translated into hopefully a better just overall product experience.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

### 设计的重要性与“品味”的定义

>> 我想，就设计这个话题而言，有一个，嗯，我觉得现在被过度使用的概念，那就是**品味**（taste: 指在设计、艺术或产品中展现出的审美判断和风格）。人们会说，嘿，开发者品味，研究员品味。嗯，但你可以把设计看作是品味的最初仲裁者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> On I guess on the design topic there's this um I feel like it's overused now but the the concept of taste. People are like hey developer taste, researcher taste. Um but you could kind of think of design as the original arbiter of of taste. Um</p>
</details>

>> 您认为在**Gamma**是否存在一种对良好品味的一致理解？嗯，我之所以问这个问题，是因为您可以在**Gamma**上构建出令人难以置信的多样化内容。然而，至少当我使用它时，总有一些清晰的设计选择是自动完成的，这让我的演示文稿看起来非常漂亮。所以，我很好奇**Gamma**的品味是怎样的，以及您如何平衡这两个有时相互冲突的原则？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> do you do you think there's a consistent sense of what good taste is at Gamma? And um I asked that because there's a incredible diversity of what you can build on Gamma. And yet when I use it at least, there's sort of clear design choices that have been made that are automated that make my presentation look really beautiful. And so I'm curious like what does taste look like at Gamma and how do you balance those two sometimes conflicting uh principles?</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。是的，这是一个很好的问题。嗯，我想先说，你知道，当人们说品味时，他们通常只想到视觉效果。就像视觉输出是什么。嗯，我经常，你知道，我更喜欢用餐厅来类比，嗯，你走进一家餐厅，你知道，你一进去，你知道，你被迎接，你被安排在你的桌子旁，你拿到菜单，你最终点餐，食物来了，很好，然后你结账。就像**端到端**（end-to-end: 指从开始到结束的整个过程）的体验需要是神奇的，对吧？如果有人只是走过来把盘子扔到你的桌子上，即使它看起来很好，你可能也不会回去告诉你的朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. Yeah, it's a great question. Um I'd start by just saying, you know, when people say taste, they oftentimes just think about only the visuals. It's like what is like the visual output. Um I often times, you know, the analogy I have more is, you know, if you you think about like a restaurant, um you go into a restaurant, you know, the moment you go in, you know, you're you're greeted, you're you you're you're seated at, you know, your table, you're handed the menu, you finally get, you know, placed in your order, the food comes, it's good, and then you get your check. Like the endto-end experience needs to be magical, right? If someone just came and threw a plate down on your table and like even if it looked good, like you probably wouldn't go back and tell your friends.</p>
</details>

所以品味实际上是在思考从你走进门的那一刻起，对我们来说，从你登录我们的产品到你实际与他人分享一些东西，你的同事，我们希望那种感觉很棒，而那一套用户体验，所有这些的积累，我们希望那种感觉就像，再次，你毫不犹豫地告诉你的朋友，就像它是一种如此愉快的体验。我认为这才是产品设计师发挥作用的地方，就像他们深入理解用户正在经历的整个旅程。视觉效果是其中很大一部分。当然，如果食物看起来不好或者味道很糟糕，没有人会再回来，但它就像，我想说，只是这个更大旅程的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and so taste is really thinking about that entire you know experience the moment you walk into the door for us the moment you you know log into our product to the moment you're actually sharing something with somebody else your colleague like we want that to feel great and the set of user experiences like the accumulation of all of that we want that to feel like something where again it's a no-brainer for you to tell your friends about like it's such a delightful experience and I think that's really where like product designers come into play is like they deeply understand that entire you journey that a user is going on. And visuals are a big part of it. Like certainly if the food doesn't look good or like tastes horrible, like no one's going to come back regardless, but it's like it's a I I'd say like only one part of like this bigger journey.</p>
</details>

所以我们考虑了很多这种端到端的东西。我们不希望**Gamma**成为，嗯，我认为，你知道，对于现有工具来说，更像是一个，也许我要在这里扼杀这种食物类比，但我们更像一个自助餐。你进去，然后你弄清楚你想拿什么，把它放到你的盘子里，回去吃，你知道，那就是一天结束了。我们想为你设计体验。所以我们希望那种体验感觉制作精良，这样作为最终用户，你仍然可以选择你想要什么，但当你得到你点的东西时，它会很棒。你保证它会很棒。所以我们正在努力实现这个愿景，我们可以帮助你策划很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we think about a lot of that end to end. We don't want gamma to be uh I think you know uh to the incumbent tools are much more like a maybe I'm going to kill this sort of food analogy here, but we're much more like a buffet. You go in and like you figure out what you want to grab, throw it on your plate, go back and eat it, and you know that that's the end of the day. We want to design the experience for you. And so we want that sort of experience to feel well crafted so that you still have as end user, you choose what you want, but when you get what you order, it's going to be great. You're guaranteed it's going to be great. And so we're trying to move towards that vision where we can help curate a lot of it for you.</p>
</details>

我们可以让它感觉毫不费力。最终，希望它只是感觉令人愉快和神奇。这才是我们心中的终极目标。我想回到您关于招聘的观点。嗯，**Ben**（Ben: 可能是指Ben Horowitz，Andreessen Horowitz的联合创始人）在15年前说过一句很棒的话，这句话经久不衰。你知道，如果你自己没有做过这份工作，你怎么知道你要招聘什么样的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can make it feel effortless. And at the end of the day, hopefully it just feels delightful and magical. And that's really the the the ultimate goal we have in mind. I guess going back to this point that you were making on hiring. Um Ben has this great quote from man I think 15 years ago that's aged really well. You know if you haven't done the job yourself how do you know what you're hiring for? Um and</p>
</details>

>> 我认为它经久不衰的原因是，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the reason I think it's aged well but</p>
</details>

>> 一路上也经历了一些曲折，那就是，嗯，可能有一种思潮认为，嘿，你一旦达到产品市场契合，就立即去招聘专家来帮助你接管。嗯，而不是自己做很长一段时间。嗯，我认为，你知道，您在其他场合说过，您在**Gamma**早期做过一些您可能没有经验的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> there's kind of been twists and turns along the way is that um there were there was probably a school of thought where it was like hey you have product market fit immediately go hire the expert and help you just take that over. um versus doing it yourself for for a good bit of time. Um and I think you know you you've sort of gone on other um on you know on the record for saying their jobs that you did in the early days for Gamma that maybe you didn't have experience doing. Um</p>
</details>

>> 有些我今天还在做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> some of them I'm still doing today.</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。创始人模式。嗯，但也许多分享一些您对“在招聘之前自己先做这份工作”这个概念的经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Exactly. Founder mode. Um but maybe share a little bit more about your experience with this concept of do the job yourself before you hire for it.</p>
</details>

### 创始人亲力亲为：先做再招

>> 是的。我完全同意**Ben**所说的。我认为，你知道，回到“招聘要痛苦地慢”这一点，其中的“痛苦”部分非常重要，就像你作为一个组织实际感受到的痛苦在哪里，那就是你开始寻找，好吧，也许我们确实需要招聘某人，或者建立那个职能。你知道，对我来说，早期很多工作都围绕着营销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I'm fully aligned Yeah. with what with what Ben said and I think you know going back to like hire painfully slowly the pain part of it is pretty important like where are you actually feeling the pain as an organization and that's where you start looking for okay maybe we do need to hire somebody or like build out that function you know for me a lot of it early days was around marketing</p>
</details>

>> 你知道，我来自金融背景，运营背景，我从未做过营销。那么好的营销是什么样的？我想在出去招聘和组建团队之前，先了解这份工作。所以，你知道，在开始做像**网红营销**（influencer marketing: 指与有影响力的个人合作，通过他们的社交媒体等渠道推广产品或服务）这样的事情时，我亲自**引导**（onboarding: 指帮助新用户或新员工熟悉产品或公司，并使其能够有效使用的过程）每一个网红，对吧？我想确保，你知道，网红将成为你团队的延伸。他们本质上相当于，你知道，如果你是B2B公司，他们就是销售团队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you know I come from a finance background operations I had never done marketing and so what does good marketing look like I wanted to kind of appreciate the job before we went out and hired and built out a team and so you know in the beginning when we started doing things like influencer marketing, I was onboarding every single influencer myself, right? I wanted to make sure, you know, they influencers are are going to be an extension of your team. They are essentially the equivalent of, you know, a sales team if if you're if you're B2B. And so, I needed to make sure that they could tell our story.</p>
</details>

所以，我需要确保他们能很好地讲述我们的故事。我不会规定他们如何讲述故事，但他们需要理解**Gamma**。我想确保他们得到了**白手套式引导**（white gloves onboarding: 指提供极其细致、周到和个性化的引导服务），这样他们就能充分理解产品，从而能够用自己的声音以最具影响力的方式讲述我们的故事。所以这些事情，我本可以很容易地雇佣某人来组建网红营销团队，因为它已经奏效了。但那样我就不会理解所有的细微之处，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I wasn't going to be prescriptive in how they tell the story, but they needed to understand Gamma. I wanted to make sure they got like white gloves onboarding so that they could fully appreciate the product so that they could tell our story and their voice uh in the most impactful way. And so those are things like I could have easily just hired somebody to build out the influencer marketing team because it was working already. But then I don't think I would have appreciated all the nuances, right?</p>
</details>

甚至这样做也让我思考，你知道，我自己成为一个创作者，比如更定期地在**LinkedIn**（LinkedIn: 一个职业社交平台）和**Twitter**（Twitter: 现称X，一个社交媒体平台）上发帖。然后你进入这种心态，好吧，成为一个创作者意味着什么？嗯，我需要学习如何成为一个更好的**文案撰稿人**（copywriter: 负责撰写广告、营销材料等文本内容的人），我需要学习好的**钩子**（hook: 指吸引读者或观众注意力的开头部分）和坏的钩子有什么区别？如何吸引观众？所有这些事情最终都变得非常重要，当你实际扩大营销职能时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And even doing so it allowed me to think about even being, you know, become a creator myself, like actually posting more regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter. And then that you go into the sort of mindset of okay, what does it mean to be a creator? Well, I need to learn how to be a better copywriter and I need to learn like what's the difference between a good hook and a bad hook? What's a way to engage an audience? And like those are all things that ends up becoming super important as you actually are scaling up a marketing function.</p>
</details>

然后当你最终面试，你知道，加入营销团队的人时，你知道，他们是否能在某种程度上提升你？如果他们甚至不如你，而你基本上只是自己学会的，那么，好吧，你知道，那可能就不太合适，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when you're finally interviewing, you know, people that to join the marketing team, you know, are they upleveling you in some way? If they're not even as good as you and you basically just learned it yourself, then okay, well, you know, that's probably not going to be a great fit,</p>
</details>

>> 对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right?</p>
</details>

>> 但现在我至少涉猎过，我可以问更好的问题，我对什么是优秀有了更好的理解。我也知道克服，你知道，平庸的门槛有多难。你可能会卡在那里，然后就觉得还行。卓越需要付出大量努力，很多时候需要很多年才能达到。所以我想这只是提高了我的标准，比如我们甚至要寻找什么样的人？当回到你实际感到痛苦的时候，你希望能够用最好的选择来缓解那种痛苦。我认为这只有在你实际开始自己理解它时才可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But now that I've at least dabbled in it, I can ask better questions and I have a better understanding of what great looks like. I also know how hard it is to like overcome like the, you know, the bar of mediocrity. Like you can get stuck there and just be okay. Greatness takes a lot of work, many times many years to get that. And so I think it just raised my bar of like who do we even look for? And when it goes back to like when you're actually feeling the pain, you you want to be able to put out that pain with like the very very best option out there. And I think that's only possible when you actually start understanding it yourself.</p>
</details>

### 创始人营销的实践

>> 是的，完全正确。也许把这一点与您关于创始人营销的观点联系起来，我非常喜欢这一点。嗯，您是最近一个发布视频的主角。我当时想，等等，这是付费演员吗？哦，不，是**Grant**。您太棒了。嗯，而且，你知道，就您把自己推向公众而言，不仅仅是**Gamma**公司，还有作为创始人、联合创始人、CEO的**Grant**，嗯，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, totally. Maybe to tie that back to your point on founder marketing, which which I really loved. Um you are the star of one of the recent launch videos. I was like, wait, is this a paid actor? Oh, no, it's Grant. Um you were amazing. Um, and you know, to your point on putting yourself out there, not just gamma the company, but Grant as founder, co-founder, CEO, um,</p>
</details>

>> 您是如何看待**直接接触**（go direct: 指公司或创始人直接与客户或公众沟通，而非通过中间渠道）这个过程的？而且，你知道，我们**A16Z**（A16Z: Andreessen Horowitz，一家风险投资公司）认为，当一位创始人能够走出去，将您的公司和产品，嗯，推向最前沿，并将其与人们真正关心和需要以及他们的痛点的**时代精神**（zeitgeist: 指特定时代普遍存在的思想、情感和信仰）联系起来时，这是非常强大的。嗯，但您是如何决定走上这条道路的，以及，嗯，你知道，对于那些也在考虑“我是否要直接接触？这对我来说不自然。通常中间有很多沟通层级”的创始人来说，嗯，您的决策过程是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> how did you think about the go direct process? And, you know, we we think it's very powerful at A16Z when a founder can go out, bring your company and product um, to the forefront and connect it to the zeitgeist of what people actually care about and need and what their pain points are. Um but h how did you decide on this journey and um you know maybe for founders out there who are also thinking about do I go direct? It's not natural to me. Usually there's layers of comms in between. Um like what was that decision-making process for you?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我的意思是，我认为有几个不同的因素在推动这一点。嗯，其中之一就是，你知道，我们内部谈论的一个价值观是“不要无聊”。所以我们发布的大部分内容都只是为了好玩和有趣，而且，嗯，我也认为创始人有责任，你知道，真正成为品牌的**守护者**（steward: 指负责管理和保护某物的人）。对吧？就像如果你不关心品牌，其他人也不会关心，没有人会像你一样关心品牌，因为这是，这就像你从零开始创造的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean I think there's a few different things driving this. Uh one one was just you know we talk about internally one of our values around just you know don't be boring. And so a lot of the a lot of the content we put out there is is just to have a little bit of fun and be playful and um and I also think it's a responsibility for the founders to you know really be the sort of steward of like what is the brand right like if if you don't care about the brand nobody else will nobody will ever care enough you know as much about the brand as probably you do because this is this is like you've you've created this from the ground up and so for us even as we get bigger you know we like to have a little bit fun I think me being part of some of these videos just ensures that you know what does the brand represent?</p>
</details>

所以对我们来说，即使我们变得更大，你知道，我们喜欢玩得开心，我认为我参与一些这些视频只是确保，你知道，品牌代表着什么？它真的，你知道，我们总是认为品牌和文化是同一枚硬币的两面。所以对我们来说，你知道，我们也非常关心我们的文化。我们的文化就是我们的团队。所以能够将其中一些融入品牌，即外部形象，我认为这只是充满了活力。就我个人而言，你知道，与我们的创意团队合作，它确实让我充满活力。就像他们太有创意了。他们梦想出我独自一人永远无法做到的事情。能够扮演哪怕一小部分角色，我会客串，或者成为演员。无论他们想让我做什么，我都会做。而且，嗯，我认为，你知道，希望我们能长期保持这种状态。但是，嗯，是的，那是，我想，让我们的团队变得特别的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really, you know, we always think about brand and culture being two two sides of the same coin. And so for us, you know, we care a lot about our culture as well. And our culture is our team. And so being able to infuse some of that into the brand as well, the external representation, I think it's just been energizing. And personally for me, you know, working with our creative team, it it really does energize me. Like they're just so creative. And they dream up things that I could never do on my own. And to be able to play even just a small role of that, I'm going to be a cameo or an actor. Whatever they want me to do, I'll do it. And uh I think you know hopefully we can preserve that for a long time. But uh yeah that's part of uh I think what's make makes our team special.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我们想以一个有趣的问题结束。嗯，它有点像**Gamarama**的主题，我们甚至没有，你知道，第一次听到我们应该在内部这样称呼它。嗯，但这个问题实际上是针对我们所有人的。所以我们都必须回答这个问题。但是，嗯，您制作的最后一个**Gamma**是什么？嗯，或者选择一个有趣的。嗯，您个人是如何使用**Gamma**的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well we thought we'd end on a fun question. Um and it's sort of this theme of uh gamaramas which we didn't even you know the first time we heard that we should call it that internally. Um but we this is actually going to be a question for all of us. So we all have to answer this. But um what was the last gamma that you made? Um or pick an interesting one. Um and and how do you personally use gamma?</p>
</details>

### 个人使用Gamma的案例

>> 是的，这是一个很棒的问题。哦，为了即将到来的**Gamarama**。我一直在思考的一个话题是，嗯，我认为现在有很多关于**长寿运动**（longevity movement: 指通过科学研究和技术手段延长人类寿命和健康期的运动）的讨论。所以我想揭开其中一些神秘面纱，也想了解，你知道，人们认为重要的共同主题是什么。我认为随着年龄的增长，你知道，我有两个年幼的孩子，仅仅是跟上他们的步伐就意味着我必须，你知道，投资于健康和体育活动等事情，所有这些都非常重要。所以，我打算在那里整理一些东西。而且，嗯，我认为这是一个，是的，一个有趣的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah that's a great one. Oh, for an upcoming Yeah. Gamarama. The one one of the topics I was I was thinking about um I think there's a lot of uh talk around like the longevity movement right now. And so I I did want to kind of demystify some of that and also just like what are the common themes around like you know what are people saying that are important. I think definitely as I get older you know I have two young kids just even trying to keep up with them just means I have to you know invest in things like just being healthier and you know physical activity all that stuff matters a ton. So, I'm going to try to put something together there. And um I think it's a yeah, kind of a fun topic.</p>
</details>

>> 完全正确。我的话题稍微有点无聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Totally. I have a slightly more boring topic.</p>
</details>

我实际上有两个，我打算稍微作弊一下。我有两个我喜欢**Gamma**的用例。其中之一是，嗯，作为**风险投资家**（VCs: Venture Capitalists，风险投资家），我们会深入研究一个领域数月，并围绕它形成一个**理论假设**（thesis: 指对某一特定领域或问题提出的核心观点、论点或研究方向）。所以，像**语音代理**（voice agents: 指能够通过语音进行交互和执行任务的人工智能系统）是我花了很多时间研究的领域。所以，我会发布一个非常长的**Gamma**，比如，你知道，几十张幻灯片。嗯，我认为我真正喜欢使用**Gamma**的地方是它的分析功能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually have two I'm going to cheat a little. I have two use cases that I love gamma for. One of them is uh as VCs do like we'll go deep into a space for months and kind of form a thesis around it. So, like voice agents is a space I spend a lot of time in. And so, I'll kind of publish a very long gamma like you know dozens of slides. Um, and I think what I really like about using Gamma uh for those is the analytics.</p>
</details>

首先是发布的便捷性。它非常容易打开和查看。我可以把它放在我的**Twitter**（Twitter: 现称X，一个社交媒体平台）个人简介里。这非常容易。但然后我实际上可以点击进去，看看这个极其漫长的理论假设的哪个部分是人们正在互动的，比如我应该多写些什么？我应该多发布些什么？

<details>
