### 幸福与成功的悖论

幸福是对你所拥有的感到满足。成功则源于不满足。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction.

那么成功值得吗？

Details
View/Hide Original English
Is success worth it then?

哎，我不确定这句话是否依然正确。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Oof. I'm not sure that statement is true anymore.

这还是我很久以前说的，这些话大多只是写给自己的笔记，而且具有高度的语境依赖性。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I made that statement a long time ago and a lot of these things are just notes to myself and they're highly contextual.

它们在当下的时刻产生，也随着当下的时刻消逝。

Details
View/Hide Original English
They come in the moment, they leave in the moment.

幸福，好吧，这是一个非常复杂的话题。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Happiness. Okay. So very complicated topic.

但我一直很喜欢**苏格拉底**（Socrates: 古希腊哲学家，西方哲学的奠基人之一）的故事：他走进集市，人们向他展示各种奢侈品和华美的饰物。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But I always like the Socrates story where he goes into the marketplace and they show him all these luxuries and fineries.

他说：“这个世界上有多少东西是我不需要的啊。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
And he says how many things there are in this world that I do not want.

这就是一种形式的自由。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And that's a form of freedom.

所以，不想要某种东西其实和拥有它一样好。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So not wanting something is as good as having it.

在这个古老的故事中，亚历山大大帝去征服世界，他遇到了住在木桶里的**第欧根尼**（Diogenes: 古希腊犬儒学派哲学家，主张苦行和回归自然）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
In the old story with Alexander and Diogenes, Alexander goes out and conquers the world and he meets Diogenes who's living in a barrel.

第欧根尼说：“别挡路，你挡住了我的阳光。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
Diogenes says get out of the way you're blocking my sun.

亚历山大说：“噢，我多么希望如果有来生，我能像第欧根尼一样。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
And Alexander says oh how I wish I could be like Diogenes in the next life.

第欧根尼则回答说：“这就是区别所在，我并不希望成为亚历山大。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
And Diogenes says that's the difference I don't wish to be Alexander.

通往幸福有两条路。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So two paths to happiness.

一条路是成功：你得到了你想要的，你满足了你的物质需求。

Details
View/Hide Original English
One path is success you get what you want you satisfy your material needs.

或者是像第欧根尼那样，你一开始就不想要这些东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Or like Diogenes you just don't want in the first place.

我不确定哪一种更有效，这也取决于你如何定义成功。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And I'm not sure which one is more valid and it also depends what you define as success.

如果最终目标是幸福，那为什么不直奔主题，直接追求幸福呢？

Details
View/Hide Original English
If the end goal is happiness then why not cut to the chase and just go straight for it.

### 幸福会削弱进取心吗？

变得幸福会让你不那么成功吗？

Details
View/Hide Original English
Does being happy make you less successful?

这是一种传统智慧。

Details
View/Hide Original English
That is a conventional wisdom.

这甚至可能是你基于现实获得的实践经验。

Details
View/Hide Original English
That may even be the practical earned experience of your reality.

你发现当你快乐时，你无欲无求，所以你不会起床去任何事情。

Details
View/Hide Original English
You find that when you're happy, you don't want anything. So, you don't get up and do anything.

另一方面，你依然必须做点什么。

Details
View/Hide Original English
On the other hand, you know, you still got to do something.

你是一种动物。你在这里是为了生存，为了繁衍。

Details
View/Hide Original English
You're an animal. You're here to survive. You're here to replicate.

你是受驱动的，你有动机，你会去做些什么。

Details
View/Hide Original English
You're driven. You're motivated. You're going to do something.

你不会整天只是坐在那里。不太可能。

Details
View/Hide Original English
You're not just going to sit there all day. Unlikely.

有些人会这样，也许这是他们的天性，但我认为大多数人还是想行动，他们想生活在竞技场中。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Some people do. Maybe it's in their nature. But I think most people still want to act. They want to live in the arena.

我发现对于我自己来说，随着我变得——“幸福”这个词太大了——变得更平和、更冷静、更活在当下、对拥有的一切更满足，我依然想做事情。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I found for myself as I've become happier is a big word, but you know, more peaceful, more calm, more present, more satisfied with what I have, I still want to do things.

我只是想做更大的事情。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I just want to do bigger things.

我想做更纯粹的事情，更符合我认为需要完成且只有我能独特完成的事情。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I want to do things that are more pure, more aligned with what I think needs to be done and what I can uniquely do.

所以从这个意义上说，我认为变得更幸福实际上可以让你更成功，但你对成功的定义可能会在这个过程中发生改变。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So in that sense, I think that being happier can actually make you more successful, but your definition of success will likely change along the way.

### 短期痛苦与长期回报的陷阱

你还有另一个观点：生活中的大部分收获来自于短期的痛苦，以便在长期获得回报。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Another one of yours, most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.

这是一个经典的观点，就像每天都在赢得**棉花糖实验**（Marshmallow Test: 心理学实验，测试儿童是否能为了更大的奖励而忍耐眼前的诱惑）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I think that's classic. Winning the marshmallow test on a daily basis.

但是，这就带来了一个有趣的挑战，我认为人们需要避免成为“痛苦成瘾者”。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But, there's an interesting challenge where I think people need to avoid becoming a suffering addict.

也就是说，把痛苦本身当作进步的代理指标，而不是关注痛苦带来的结果。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Sort of using suffering as the proxy for progress as opposed to the outcome of the suffering.

这就好比：“我不吃棉花糖很痛苦，我做这项工作很痛苦。我把幸福感和满足感与痛苦挂钩了，而不是与痛苦在那之后带给我的东西挂钩。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
It's like I was in pain not eating the marshmallow. I was in pain doing this work. I have attached well-being and satisfaction to pain, not to what the pain gets me on the other side of it.

如果你把“痛苦”定义为肉体上的疼痛，那是真实存在的，你无法忽视它。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If you define pain as physical pain, then it's a real thing. It happens and you can't ignore it.

但这并不是我们所说的“受苦”。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But that's not what we mean by suffering.

受苦主要是精神上的折磨和痛苦。它仅仅意味着你不想做手头的任务。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Suffering is mostly mental anguish and mental pain. And it just means you don't want to do the task at hand.

如果你愿意做手头的任务，你就不会感到受苦。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If you were fine doing the task at hand, then you wouldn't be suffering.

那么问题来了：是一路受苦更有效，还是把它解读为一种非受苦的方式更有效？

Details
View/Hide Original English
And then the question is what's more effective to suffer along the way or just to interpret it in a way that it's not suffering?

你听到很多成功人士回顾过去时说：“噢，旅程才是有趣的部分。那实际上是令人愉快的部分，我应该更享受它才对。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
You hear from a lot of successful people they look back and they say oh the journey was the fun part right that was actually the entertaining part and I should have enjoyed it more.

这是一种常见的遗憾。

Details
View/Hide Original English
It's a common regret.

### 时间旅行的思想实验

我喜欢做一个小小的思想练习：回到你自己的生活中，试着把自己置于5年前、10年前、15年前或20年前的确切位置。

Details
View/Hide Original English
There's a little thought exercise I like to do, which is you can go back into your own life and try to put yourself in the exact position you were in 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago.

试着回忆：我和谁在一起？我在做什么？我在感受什么？我的情绪如何？我的目标是什么？

Details
View/Hide Original English
And you try to remember, okay, who was I with? What was I doing? What was I feeling? What were my emotions? What were my objectives?

真正尝试把自己传送回去，看看你是否会给自己任何建议，或者做任何不同的事情。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And really, really try to transport yourself back and see if there's any advice you'd give yourself. Anything you do differently.

当然，你并没有新的信息。别假装你可以回去买股票或**比特币**（Bitcoin）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Now, you don't have new information. And don't pretend you could have gone back and, you know, bought a stock or bought Bitcoin or whatever.

仅仅基于你现在对自己性情的了解，以及一点与年龄相关的经验，你会如何以不同的方式做事？

Details
View/Hide Original English
But just knowing what you know now in terms of your temperament and a little bit of age related experience, how would you have done things differently?

我认为这是一个值得做的练习。我不剥夺你自己得出结论的机会，但我可以告诉你我的结论。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And I think it's a worthwhile exercise to do. So don't let me rob you of the conclusion, but I'll tell you for me.

我会做同样的事情，但我会带着更少的愤怒、更少的情绪、更少的内心痛苦去做，因为那是可选项，并非必须。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I would have done everything the same except I would have done it with less anger, less emotion, less internal suffering because that was optional. It wasn't necessary.

我会争辩说，一个能至少平和地——甚至是快乐地——完成工作的人，会比一个陷入不必要情绪动荡的人更有效率。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And I would argue that someone who can do the job at least peacefully but maybe happily is going to be more effective than someone who has unnecessary emotional turmoil.

否则，你最终只会得到一连串悲惨的成功。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Well, you end up with a series of miserable successes, right?

结果可能是一样的，但到达那里的整个体验——旅程不仅是奖赏，旅程是唯一存在的东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The outcome may have been the same, but the entire experience of getting there and and the journey is not only the reward. The journey is the only thing there is.

### 财富游戏 vs 地位游戏

地位游戏总是零和博弈。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Status games are inherently limited. They're always combative.

在旧社会，比如狩猎采集时代，不存在财富这回事。你只有你能携带的东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
In old society, let's go back hunter gatherer times, there was no such thing as wealth. You just had what you could carry.

没有储存的财富，所以财富创造游戏并不真正存在。当时只存在地位游戏。

Details
View/Hide Original English
There was no stored wealth. So wealth games didn't really exist to wealth creation games. All that existed was status games.

如果你地位高，你就能优先获得那一点点可用的资源。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If you were high status, then you got what little was available first.

但即使在那时，你也必须通过照顾部落来赢得地位。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Um but even back then, you had to earn your status by taking care of the tribe.

现在我们有了财富创造，你可以真正创造产品或服务，你可以扩展该产品或服务，并为许多人提供富足。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh now we have wealth creation where you can actually create a product or a service. You can scale that product or service and you can provide abundance for a lot of people.

那不是零和博弈，那是正和博弈。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And that's not zero sum, that's a positive sum game.

我可以富有，你可以富有，我们可以一起创造东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I can be wealthy, you can be wealthy, we can create things together.

显然，既然我们集体比狩猎采集时代要富有得多，财富创造就是正向的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And clearly since we are all collectively far far wealthier than we were in huntergatherer times. Uh wealth creation is positive.

但地位是有限的。地位总是稀缺的，它是一个等级阶梯，一种层级结构。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But status is limited. There's limited status to go around. It's a ranking ladder. It's a hierarchy.

一个人的地位上升，必定意味着另一个人的地位下降。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And so it's a rise in status. Somebody else has a lower in status.

所以要意识到，地位游戏本质上是有限的，它们总是充满斗争。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So just realize that status games are inherently limited. Uh they're always combative.

相比之下，财富创造游戏可以只是创造产品，你不需要与任何人战斗。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Whereas uh wealth creation games can be just you're creating products. You don't have to fight anybody else.

是的，在市场上你的产品必须成功，但这与攻击他人、对他人生气、感到被压制或与某人结怨是完全不同的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Yes, in the marketplace your product has to succeed, but that's not quite the same as uh invective against other people or being angry with other people or feeling pushed down or pushed up or having a beef with somebody.

我会争辩说，财富创造游戏不仅更令人愉快，它们是正和的，而且确实有具体的物质回报。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So, I would argue that wealth creation games are both more pleasant. Uh they're positive sum and they actually have uh concrete material returns.

如果你有更多的钱，你可以买更多的东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If you have more money, you can buy more.

你无法去银行兑换你的地位。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Show me where you can exchange your status at the bank.

没错，那是模糊不清的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Exactly. Yeah. It's it's it's vague and it's fuzzy.

现在你看到人们发财了，有了钱，他们想要什么？他们想要地位。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Now, you see people get rich, they have money, what do they want? They want status.

所以他们去好莱坞演电影，捐款给非营利组织，去参加TED演讲或达沃斯论坛。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So they go to Hollywood, start starring in movies, they donate to nonprofits, they go to TEDs or Davos or what have you.

他们开始试图用钱换取地位。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Um, and they start trying to trade the money for status.

人们总是想要他们没有的东西。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So, you know, people always want what they don't have.

我们在进化上就被硬编码为追求地位，因为正如我所说，在农业革命之前，财富创造并不真正存在。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh, and we are evolutionarily hardwired for status because as I said, wealth creation didn't really exist until the agricultural revolution.

### 自尊与内在法则

如果你想拥有高自尊，那就赢得你自己的尊重。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If you want to uh have high self-esteem then earn your own selfrespect.

我有一个关于内在黄金法则的想法。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I had this idea the internal golden rule.

黄金法则说：像你希望别人对待你那样去对待别人。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So the golden rule says treat others the way that you should be treated. You want to be treated.

内在黄金法则说：像你希望别人本该对待你的那样去对待自己。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The internal golden rule says treat yourself like others should have treated you.

这是对那些并未在无条件之爱中长大的人的一种回应。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And it was a a repost to maybe people that didn't grow up with unconditional love.

关于爱，有一件有趣的事情：你可以试着回忆被爱的感觉。

Details
View/Hide Original English
On the love thing, one of the interesting things about love is you can try to remember the feeling of being loved.

回到某人爱上你，或者某人确实爱你的时刻，真正地去感受它，并在内心重建这种感觉。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So go back to when someone was in love with you or someone did love you and like really remember that feeling like really sit with it and try to recreate it within yourself.

然后，去感受你爱某人时的感觉，当你处于恋爱中时。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And then go to the feeling of you loving someone and when you were in love.

想想当你对某人或某物感到爱意时的情景。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And uh think about when you felt love towards someone or something.

现在，哪一种更好？

Details
View/Hide Original English
And now which is better?

我会争辩说，去爱的感觉实际上比被爱的感觉更令人振奋。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And I would argue that the feeling of being in love is actually more exhilarating than the feeling of being loved.

被爱有点让人腻烦，有点太甜了，你甚至想把那个人推开，这有点尴尬。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Being loved is a little clawing. It's a little too sweet. You kind of want to push the person away. It's a little embarrassing.

另一方面，去爱的感觉是非常开阔的，非常开放的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
On the other hand, the feeling of being in love is very expansive. It's very open.

它实际上让你成为一个更好的自己，它让你想成为一个更好的人。

Details
View/Hide Original English
It actually makes you a better version of yourself. It makes you want to be a better person.

所以你随时都可以创造爱，只是那种想要“获得”爱的渴望才是问题所在。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And so you can create love anytime you want. It's just that craving to receive it. That's the problem.

### 傲慢是昂贵的代价

最昂贵的性格特质是傲慢（Pride）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The most expensive trait is pride.

为什么？

Details
View/Hide Original English
How come?

因为傲慢是学习的敌人。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh I I tweeted that just because I think that uh pride is the enemy of learning.

当我看着我的朋友和同事时，那些依然停留在过去、成长最少的人，是那些最傲慢的人。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So when I look at my friends and colleagues, the ones who are still stuck in the past and have grown the least are the ones who were the proudest.

因为他们觉得自己已经有了答案，所以不想公开纠正自己。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Because they sort of feel like they already had the answers. And so they don't want to correct themselves publicly.

傲慢阻止你说“我错了”。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So pride prevents you from saying I'm wrong.

这可能很简单，比如你交易股票，但不愿承认自己错了，所以你死守着一笔糟糕的交易。

Details
View/Hide Original English
It could be as simple as you're trading stocks and then you don't admit you were wrong. So you hang on to a lousy trait.

或者你决定和一个不合适的人结婚、搬到一个不合适的地方或进入一个不合适的行业，结果行不通，但你不愿承认错误，于是就被困住了。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh it could be that you uh made a decision to uh you know marry someone or move somewhere or enter a profession, it doesn't work out and then you don't want to admit that you were wrong so you get stuck in it.

这主要是关于被困在局部最优解，而不是退回去重新攀登另一座山峰。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh it's mostly about getting trapped in local maxima as opposed to going back down and climbing up the mountain again.

你会为此付出金钱、成功和时间的代价。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh it's going to cost you money. it's going to cost you success and time.

伟大的艺术家总是有能力重新开始，无论是 Paul Simon、Madonna 还是 **U2**（爱尔兰著名摇滚乐队）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The great artists always have this ability to start over whether it's Paul Simon or Madonna or U2.

即便是伟大的企业家，也总是愿意重新开始。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Um but even the great entrepreneurs, they're just always willing to start over.

我总是被 **Elon Musk**（埃隆·马斯克）的故事所打动。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh I'm always struck by the Elon Musk story.

他说过类似这样的话：“我从 PayPal 的出售中赚了2亿美元。我把1亿投进了 **SpaceX**，8000万投进了 **Tesla**，2000万投进了 **SolarCity**，最后我不得不借钱付房租。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
And he said something like along the lines of, uh, I made $200 million from the sale of PayPal. I put $100 million into SpaceX, 80 million Tesla, 20 into Solar City, and I had to borrow money for rent.

这家伙是一个永远的冒险者，他总是愿意重新开始。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Right? This guy is a perennial risk taker. He's always willing to start over.

他不在乎被视为成功还是失败，他愿意把一切都押上。

Details
View/Hide Original English
He doesn't have any pride about being seen as successful or being seen as a failure. He's willing to put it all in.

关键在于，他总是愿意归零。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But the key thing is he's always willing to start over, right?

创造任何伟大的事物都需要从0到1，这意味着你要回到0，这是非常痛苦且难以做到的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And creating anything great requires zero to one. And that means you go back to zero and that's really painful and hard to do.

### 整体性自私与无需道歉的自我优先

如果你想概括如何在生活中获得成功，我会用两个词：**产品化你自己**（Productize Yourself）。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If I had to summarize how to be successful in life in two words, I would just say productize yourself.

弄清楚你天生擅长什么，什么是世界可能需要的，你可以将其规模化并转化为产品。

Details
View/Hide Original English
That's it. Just figure out what it is that you naturally do that the world might want that you can scale up and turn into a product.

最终这对你来说将是不费吹灰之力的。是的，总是需要工作，但这甚至不会感觉像是在工作，这感觉像是在玩耍。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And it'll be it'll eventually be effortless for you. Yes, there's always work required, but it won't even feel like work to you. It'll feel like play to you.

现代社会给了我们这样的机会。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And modern society gives us that opportunity.

如果你生活在2000年前，出生在农场，你的选择非常有限。

Details
View/Hide Original English
You know, if you were 2,000 years ago, you're born in a farm. Your choices are very limited.

现在，你确实可以醒来后搬到另一个城市，换个职业，换份工作，改变和你在一起的人。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Now, you can literally wake up and you can move to a different city. You can switch careers. You can switch jobs. You can change the people that you're with.

这里有无限的机会。

Details
View/Hide Original English
There is infinite opportunity out there for you.

所以，把这看作是一个搜索函数，去寻找最需要你的人，去寻找最需要你的工作，去寻找最适合你的地方，这要好得多。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And so it's much better to treat this like a search function to find the people who need you the most, to find the work that needs you the most, to find the place you're best suited to be at.

在投入“开发”（exploitation）之前，花时间进行“探索”（exploration）是值得的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And it's worthwhile to spend time in that exploration before diving into exploitation.

在选择如此之多的世界里，最大的错误就是过早承诺。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The biggest mistake in a world with so many choices is premature commitment.

### 拒绝安排，拥抱随机性

过度安排的生活是不值得过的。

Details
View/Hide Original English
The overscheduled life is not worth living.

这并不是我们进化的方式，不是我们成长的方式，也不是我们孩提时的样子——除非你有个直升机父母或虎妈。

Details
View/Hide Original English
That's not how we evolved. It's not how we grew up. Um it's not how how we were as children hopefully uh unless you're a helicopter parent or a tiger mom.

你的自然秩序是自由。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Um your natural order is freedom.

我曾有个朋友对我说：“我不想不得不在特定时间出现在特定地点。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
Uh I had a friend who uh said to me once, you know, uh I never want to have to be at a specific place at a specific time.

我当时想：“天哪，那就是自由。”

Details
View/Hide Original English
And I was like, "Oh my god, that's freedom."

这句话改变了我的人生。

Details
View/Hide Original English
When I heard that, that changed my life right there.

你仍然不用闹钟吗？

Details
View/Hide Original English
You still arm alarm clockless?

是的，我不用闹钟。今天为了不至于错过这个节目，我确实设了闹钟。

Details
View/Hide Original English
Yes, I'm alarm clockless. Today, I did set my alarm clock just so I wouldn't miss this.

但我把闹钟设在了上午11点，以防我那天得了流感。我不会把闹钟设在早上8点或9点。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But just so you know, I set the alarm clock from 11:00 a.m. in case I was stricken with a flu that day. I wasn't going to set my alarm clock for 8:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m.

果然，我在那之前好几个小时就醒了。

Details
View/Hide Original English
And sure enough, I got up many hours before that.

我也坚信灵感是有时效性的，要立即行动。

Details
View/Hide Original English
But also another thing that I really believe is that inspiration is perishable. Act on it immediately.

当你有灵感去做某事时，就去做那件事。

Details
View/Hide Original English
So when you're inspired to do something, do that thing.

如果我有灵感写博客，我就在那一刻写。如果我有灵感发推文，我就在那一刻发。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If I'm inspired to write a blog post, I want to do it at that moment. If I'm inspired to send a tweet, I want to do it at that moment.

如果我有灵感读书，我就在那一刻读。如果我有灵感解决问题，我就在那一刻解决。

Details
View/Hide Original English
If I'm inspired to read a book, I want to read it right then. If I'm inspired to solve a problem, I solve it right there.

我在好奇心到来的那一刻就去学习，那正是学习发生的时候。

Details
View/Hide Original English
I do it at the moment of curiosity. The moment the curiosity arrives, I go learn that thing immediately. And that's when the learning happens.

这不会因为我安排了时间、预留了一小时而发生，因为当那个时间到来时，我可能心情变了，我可能想做别的事情。

Details

Stress is when uh like if you look at an iron beam, when an iron beam is under stress, it's cuz it's being bent in two different directions at the same time.

所以，当你的精神承受压力时，是因为它同时有两个相互冲突的欲望。
