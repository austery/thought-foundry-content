### 特朗普选举言论

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 3 日，星期二。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, February 3rd. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 有些州非常腐败，但它们却在计票。我赢了的州却显示我没赢。现在你们将看到...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn't win. Now you're going to see

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **总统特朗普**正在升级他围绕美国选举的言论，他在昨天的采访中表示，选举应该被彻底改革，**共和党**应该“**接管投票**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> President Trump is stepping up his rhetoric around American elections, saying in an interview yesterday that they should be overhauled and that the Republican party should quote

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “共和党应该说，‘我们想接管。我们应该接管投票，在至少 15 个地方接管投票。’”特朗普呼吁一个政党控制投票机制，这与**宪法**相悖，宪法规定选举主要由各州负责。总统一再表示，选举系统需要改变，并引用了关于他 2020 年落败的已被证伪的说法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: nationalize voting. >> The Republicans should say, "We want to take over. We should take over the voting the voting in at least many 15 places." Trump's call for a political party to seize control of voting mechanisms is at odds with the Constitution, which says that elections are primarily run by the states. The president has repeatedly said that changes in the election system are needed, pointing to debunked claims

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 引用这些说法，他的政府一直在采取一系列措施来加强对美国选举的控制。他签署了一项**行政命令**，试图要求选民在投票前提供**公民身份证明**，这项努力在很大程度上被法院阻止了。**司法部**一直在要求众多州提供包含个人和私人信息的完整选民名册。就在上个月，司法部长致函明尼苏达州，特别要求提供这些数据，并称这是“恢复法律和秩序”的必要步骤。选举官员已表示担忧，担心这些数据可能被滥用或操纵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: about his defeat in 2020. Citing those claims, his administration has been taking a number of steps to exert more control over American elections. He signed an executive order trying to, among other things, demand proof of citizenship before voting, an effort that's largely been blocked by the courts. And the Justice Department has been demanding that numerous states turn over their full voter roles containing personal and private information. Just last month, the attorney general sent a letter to Minnesota specifically

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，据《泰晤士报》获悉，在一个不同寻常的时刻，特朗普直接与上周被派往搜查**佐治亚州**一处选举中心的两名**FBI**特工进行了对话。特工们搜查了来自**富尔顿县**的 2020 年的数卡车选票，该县由**拜登**以较大优势获胜。一位曾在共和党和民主党政府任职的前司法部高级官员表示，特朗普与特工的互动是过去做法的一个重大转变，称总统直接参与刑事调查的进行方式“对我们的民主极其危险”，尤其是总统在其中有个人利益的情况下。白宫发言人回应提问时表示：“特朗普总统承诺确保美国选举的安全，他已委托最优秀的一批爱国者来完成这项任务。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: demanding that data and calling it a necessary step to quote, "Bring back law and order." Election officials have expressed concern that the data could be misused or manipulated. And lastly, the Times has learned that in a remarkable moment, Trump talked directly to the FBI agents who were sent to search an election center in Georgia last week. The agents seized truckloads of ballots from 2020 from Fulton County, which Biden won by a wide margin. A former senior Justice Department official who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations said Trump's interaction with the agents was a major departure from past practice, calling it quote extremely dangerous to our democracy for the president to be directly involved in how a criminal investigation is carried out, especially one that the president has a personal stake in. In response to questions, a

**Tracy Mumford**: White House spokesman said, "President Trump pledged to secure America's elections, and he has tasked the most talented team of patriots to do just that."

### 移民政策争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于**特朗普政府**的移民镇压行动有两个快速更新。今天标志着政府部分停摆的第四天，国会两党在**ICE**和**国土安全部（DHS）**的资金问题上发生冲突。上周，**参议院**通过了一项两党法案，仅为 DHS 提供临时资金，以便就联邦特工的“护栏”进行谈判，例如结束无差别搜捕。但由于众议院的许多共和党人反对这项妥协，尚不清楚众议院将多快推进该法案。与此同时，8000 亿美元的军事开支被冻结，以及用于劳工部、卫生与公众服务部以及交通部等机构的资金也被冻结。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two quick updates on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Today marks the fourth day and counting of a partial government shutdown as lawmakers on Capitol Hill clash over funding for ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. Last week, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that provided only temporary funding for DHS in order to allow for negotiations on guard rails for federal agents, like ending indiscriminate sweeps. But it's not clear how quickly the House will move to pass the bill since a number of Republicans there are opposed to the compromise. In the meantime, $800 billion in military spending is frozen, as well as money for the departments of labor, health and human services, and transportation among other agencies.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 此外，数十万来自**海地**的移民获得了暂时的喘息机会，因为一名**联邦法官**叫停了政府终止他们法律保护的举措。许多海地人根据所谓的 TPS（**临时保护身份**）被允许在美国生活和工作，这是由于他们国家的人道主义危机和普遍的动荡。然而，特朗普政府曾试图终止这些保护，认为让海地人留在美国不符合国家利益。但在一项严厉的裁决中，法官表示，政府的动机至少部分源于**种族歧视**，并且忽视了海地人对美国经济数十亿美元的贡献。

**Tracy Mumford**: and hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Haiti have been given a temporary reprieve after a federal judge hit pause on the administration's effort to end their legal protection. Many Haitians have been allowed to live and work in the US under what's known as TPS, temporary protected status, due to a humanitarian crisis and widespread unrest in their country. The Trump administration, however, had moved to end those protections, arguing that keeping Haitians in the US wasn't in the national interest. But in a scathing ruling, the judge said the administration was motivated, at least in part, by racial animists and that it had ignored the billions of dollars that

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 值得注意的是，海地人在美国的**医疗保健系统**中扮演着至关重要的角色，他们在医院、诊所和养老院中人数众多。例如，佛罗里达州博卡拉顿一家老年护理中心的主管表示，如果他们的身份发生变化，她将不得不解雇 30 名海地员工。海地人并非 TPS 持有者中唯一受到政府针对的群体。在过去一个月左右的时间里，联邦法官已阻止政府终止来自**洪都拉斯、尼泊尔、尼加拉瓜**和**南苏丹**的人员的 TPS 身份。政府已表示将对所有这些裁决提出上诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Haitians contribute to the US economy. Notably, Haitians play a crucial role in America's health care system, working in large numbers in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. The head of one senior care center in Boca Raton, Florida, for example, said she would have to let go of 30 Haitian employees if their status changed. Haitians are not the only group of TPS holders the administration has targeted. In the past month or so, federal judges have blocked the government from ending TPS status for people from Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and South Sudan. The administration has signaled it will appeal all of those rulings.

### 克林顿 Epstein 案

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨晚，经过一个月的漫长斗争，**比尔和希拉里·克林顿**同意就**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**案接受**众议院监督委员会**的调查。克林顿夫妇曾面临如果拒绝作证将被起诉**刑事藐视罪**的威胁，这一推动得到了共和党人和少数民主党人的支持。让这对夫妇作证是共和党籍的监督委员会主席**詹姆斯·科默**的一项重大胜利。他试图将他小组的爱泼斯坦调查焦点从特朗普总统及其政府处理此事的措施转移到与这位被定罪的性犯罪者有牵连的知名民主党人身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Last night, after a month's long battle, Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed to testify in the House Oversight Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The Clintons had been facing the threat of criminal contempt charges if they refused, a push that had been supported by Republicans and a handful of Democrats. Getting the couple to testify is a major victory for James Comer, the Republican chair of the oversight committee. He has tried to shift the focus of his panel's Epstein investigation away from President Trump and his administration's handling of the matter and toward prominent Democrats, who also had ties to the convicted sex offender.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 比尔·克林顿在 2000 年代初曾四次乘坐爱泼斯坦的私人飞机出行，但他表示自己从未去过爱泼斯坦的私人岛屿，并且在二十年前就已断绝与他的联系。希拉里·克林顿则表示她从未见过或与爱泼斯坦说过话。克林顿夫妇何时何地作证的细节仍在协商中，但一位前总统出现在国会面前是近乎史无前例的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Bill Clinton took four trips on Epstein's private jet in the early 2000s, though he says he never visited Epstein's private island and cut off contact with him two decades ago. Hillary Clinton has said she never met or spoke to Epstein. The details of when and where the Clintons will testify are still being worked out, but it is nearly unprecedented for a former president to appear before Congress.

### 加沙过境开放

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在**加沙**，通往**埃及**的边境口岸在自 2024 年春季以来大部分时间关闭后重新开放。希望它能成为需要医疗疏散人员的生命线，但它有一个不稳定的开端。昨天只有少数**巴勒斯坦人**获得了离开的许可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Gaza yesterday, the border crossing into Egypt reopened after being largely closed since the spring of 2024. The hope is that it can be a lifeline for people who need to be evacuated for medical care, but it had a faltering start. Only a small number of Palestinians appeared to get clearance to leave yesterday.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 《泰晤士报》走访了加沙的医院，并与那些焦急等待获准离开的巴勒斯坦人进行了交谈。一位父亲说，他担心患有急性肝衰竭的儿子无法及时出去。重新开放也允许少数早期逃离战争的加沙居民首次返回家园。最终，人道主义组织希望该口岸能被用于将数卡车援助物资运入该地区。但目前这还不被允许。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Times visited hospitals in Gaza and talked with Palestinians who are anxiously waiting to get approval to go. >> One father said he was nervous that his son, who has acute liver failure, wouldn't get out in time. The reopening is also letting a limited number of Gazins who fled earlier in the war return home for the first time. And eventually, humanitarian groups hope the crossing can be used to move truckloads of aid into the territory. for now that is not allowed.

### 超级碗替代秀

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，这是一个重大、重大的公告。这是关于全美橄榄球联赛（**NFL**）**超级碗**中场秀的首次公告。它将在这里举行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, >> this is a major major announcement. This is the first uh announcement about the All-American halftime show. It's happening right here.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 保守派团体 **Turning Point USA** 表示，它将在本周日超级碗期间举办自己的演唱会，作为官方中场秀的替代。**Bad Bunny**，他一直是特朗普政府的直言不讳的批评者，是 NFL 的领衔表演者。但 Turning Point USA 选择的是 **Kid Rock**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> The conservative group Turning Point USA says it's going to put on its own concert during the Super Bowl this Sunday as an alternative to the official halftime show. Bad Bunny, who has been a very vocal critic of the Trump administration, is the NFL's headliner. But Turning Point has chosen Kid Rock.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们要做的就是出去为热爱这个国家的人们演奏一些伟大的音乐。就这么简单。” Kid Rock 过去曾为特朗普总统在政治活动中表演过。在宣布这一消息时，他指责在**格莱美奖**上获得年度专辑奖的 Bad Bunny 的观众拥有“觉醒心态病毒”。Turning Point USA 计划在其演唱会流媒体直播时间与中场秀同步，中场秀通常是每年观看人数最多的全球音乐会。去年有超过 1.3 亿人收看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> What we're going to do is go out there and just try to play some great music for people who love this country. It's that simple. >> Kid Rock has played at political events for President Trump in the past. He joined in for the announcement during which he accused the crowd at the Grammys where Bad Bunny just won album of the year of having a woke mind virus. Turning Point USA plans to stream its concert at the same time as the halftime show which is generally the world's most viewed concert every year. More than 130
