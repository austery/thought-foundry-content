### 书籍的哲学与反思

**主持人**: 感谢您抽出宝贵时间与我们交流。这是一本很棒的书！我发现它读起来像一本回忆录，但也像一次冥想。我很想知道，您在开始写作时是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Adrianne, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us. A lovely book! What I found interesting is it reads like a memoir but also reads like a meditation. I'm curious, what did you have in mind when you started to write it?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 我很早就清楚，我想以一种更偏向哲学或学习的方式来写，而不是试图说教别人。所以我想确保我们能以那种方式来写，分享我的故事和我的旅程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: It was clear early on that I wanted to write it in a way that was more of a philosophy or learning, and not so much trying to lecture people. So I wanted to to ensure that we were able to do it in that sort of way, to sort of sharing my stories and my journey.

</details>

### 人生转折点

**主持人**: 您的书中的第一个场景描绘了一个相当严肃的事件，我很想知道您能否告诉我们那个场景中发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: The first scene in your book depicts quite a serious event, and I'm curious if you can tell us what happened in that in that scenario.

</details>

**Adrienne**: 那是我人生中一段非常艰难的时期，我知道那就是一切真正改变我的地方。很多事情都成为了我人生的一个重要转折点。我想，那一晚和那种触发，你知道，一系列事件，导致我走向了**康复（rehab）**。当然。我想我触及了他们所说的**人生低谷（rock bottom）**，那是一个可怕的时刻。对我来说，它真的让我开始思考我的人生，并渴望变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: It was a time in my life where it was I found very difficult, and I knew that that's where everything kind of really changed for me. And things kind of was a major turning point in my life. So and it started I think it started that night and that sort of set off, you know, a sequence, a sequence of other events that kind of led me to rehab. Certainly. I think I hit what they call rock bottom, and that was a scary moment. And for me, it really got me thinking about my life and wanting to get better. So.

</details>

**Adrienne**: 所以，当我们回顾成长过程中可能遇到的困难时，你知道，父亲的离世，我家中有**酗酒（alcoholism）**问题，很多困难和损失，与我的兄弟姐妹分离等等，还有，我认为是因为我的混血身份而遭受的排斥，你知道，来自我的外祖父母和祖父母，尤其是我的祖父。这并不容易。我发现它非常困难，而且我在很年轻的时候就感受到了。在我年轻的时候，我很难处理这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: So when we back up and we look at how difficult things might have been growing up, you know, the loss of my father and I had alcoholism in my home just a lot. A lot of hardships and loss, being separated from my siblings and things like that, and also being rejected, I think because of my mixed, mixed ethnicity feeling that rejection, you know, come from my maternal and paternal grandparents, my grandfather particularly. It wasn't easy. I found it really difficult and I felt it, you know, at a young age. And it was it was hard for me to, to kind of process that, especially in my younger years.

</details>

### 音乐作为避难所

**主持人**: 人们认识你是因为你的音乐。通过这本书，人们也了解了你所经历的挑战。我想知道你是否能联系起来。在那些艰难的时刻，音乐是如何成为你的避难所的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: People know you for your music. People know that through this book, the challenge that you go through, I wonder if you can help connect that. How is music been a refuge for you through some of those hard times?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 当你早些时候提到触及人生低谷并想结束自己的生命时，我当时肯定感觉我失去了控制。我失去了对一切的控制，那是一种可怕、可怕的感觉，那种完全失去自我控制，以及让我在乎的人们感到恐惧，然后从那里走向康复，你知道，理解我身上发生的事情，并学习如何应对所有那些事情，以及在康复期间重新发现音乐，并能够将其用作一种工具，来，你知道，放下某些事情，就像艺术能够为那些情感和感受找到一个去处，你知道，去释放，你知道，把它们带到世界上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: When you talked about hitting rock bottom earlier and wanting to take my own life, what I certainly felt in that moment was I had no control. I lost control of everything, and that was a scary, scary feeling to to have that complete loss of control over yourself and scaring the people around me that I cared about, and then moving forward into rehab from there and, you know, understanding what was going on with me and learning about that and how to cope with all those things, and rediscovering music while in rehab and being able to use that as a tool to kind of, you know, let go of certain things, like to be able to release, you know, kind of saying art is really good for being able to find a place for those emotions and those feelings to kind of live, you know, and let go and put them out into the world.

</details>

### 汗屋仪式

**主持人**: 这段旅程的一部分也是体验**汗屋（sweat lodge）**。你描述了第一次体验，当时你并没有打算参加禁食，你只是去帮忙。这些仪式对你这样的人，以及对克里族人来说意味着什么？在汗屋里占据那个空间？从精神上来说，这对你意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Part of that journey is also experiencing the sweat lodge. You describe your first experience where you weren't planning to take part in a fast. You were there to help. What did those rituals mean for for someone like you, but also for Cree people to to be able to take that space in a sweat lodge? And spiritually, what does that mean for you?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 嗯，我想是的，我参加的第一个禁食，我是说，我一直都知道这些事情，因为我的家人就在身边，我见过它们。而且，你知道，我从小就听了很多关于它们的事情，但我一直不太想去那些地方，因为，你知道，我当时个人经历的事情。直到我完成了康复，然后我去了，去了法国河（French River）的一个仪式，就在**湿地工厂（Moose Factory）**的西部，湿地工厂的社区。我和我的兄弟一起参加了那里的仪式，他一直邀请我。你知道，他康复后说，你需要来。我总是说，下次我带你去。但总之，我那年去了，我真的没有打算，你知道，真正参与任何事情。只是去观察。但我只是想更多地了解它。于是我去了，他们那天开始搭建汗屋。你知道，人们有他们的营地，他们搭建帐篷，布置一切。那天晚上我们举行了宴会。你知道，主持仪式的人开始，你知道，进行**管子仪式（pipe ceremony）**，然后是祈祷，然后是歌唱。对我来说，那是一次非常奇妙的经历。我感觉与这一切都联系了起来，即使我并没有真正地，你知道，全身心地投入，你知道，成长过程中。但我感觉我注定要在那里。那个晚上，有什么东西真的吸引了我。然后，当他们问，这里有很多禁食者。我从来没想过，我就说，所有人都禁食。所以我，你知道，我自愿禁食，那是我第一次禁食，大概是我年轻的时候，对我来说，那是一次，那几乎是一种觉醒，我想，在某种程度上。它真的让我对很多事情大开眼界。我再也没有以同样的方式看待世界，因为当你做一些精神上的事情时，它会改变你，以及你所经历的一些难以置信的事情。但是，你知道，我亲眼所见，我感受到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: Well, I think yeah, the first fast I ever went to I mean, I was always aware of those things because my family was around them and I seen them. And I've, you know, I've certainly heard a lot about them growing up, but never really felt that I wanted to be in those places because, you know, what was going on personally with me. And it wasn't until I got through rehab and then I went, went to the ceremony up in French River, just just just west of the Moose Factory, the community of Moose Factory. And I attended the ceremony there for the first time with my brother, who always invited me. You know, when he'd come through, he said, you need to come. And I always say, and I'll get you next time. But anyway, I went that year and I had no real intention of, of doing it, you know, being really fully participating in anything that was. Going to observe. But I just wanted to know more about what it was about. And so I went and they started off by building the lodge that day. And, you know, people have their camps and they build their tents and set everything up. And we had a feast that night. And, you know, the the person running the ceremony began by, you know, rendering the pipe ceremony and then and then the prayers started, then the singing started. And it was such an amazing experience for me. And I felt really connected to, to to all of that, even though I didn't really, you know, put myself in, immerse myself in that growing up. But I felt like I was meant to be there. And there was something that really called to me that that particular night. And, and when they asked, so many fasters are here. And I had like, I had not even thought about it and I just said, are all fast. So I, you know, I volunteered fast and and that was my first fast was probably it was a young man and it was a very for me, it was a, it was a very it was almost like an awakening, I guess, in some way. And it really opened my eyes to a lot of a lot of things. I never looked at the world the same way again, because when you do something spiritual like that, it changes you and some of the things you experience that are difficult to believe. But, you know, like I've seen it with my own eyes, I felt it.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，在最后一天会发生一些事情。是的。你去了那里，你祈求健康保护，以及拥有做事的毅力。但你也去那里了解自己。当你停止饮水和进食几天时，就像你的人类祖父母和造物主一样，他们会担心，你为什么不吃东西？你为什么不喝水？精神层面也是如此。他们说他们会担心，他们会来。他们说他们会来看你，和你一起拜访，因为他们关心我们，即使是在精神层面。所以，我们不仅要了解物质世界和我们的祖父母，还需要了解精神层面。这就是克里族人和其他原住民文化能够做到这一点的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Well, there was something that happens on sort of the.

**Interviewer**: Last day. Yeah. You get, you know, you go there and you ask for the things like good health protection and to have the strength to be able to do things. But you also go there to get to know who you are. And when you stop the water and the food for several days, just like your human grandparents and creator, they could concerned, why are you not eating? Why are you not drinking? It's the same thing on the spiritual side. They say they get concerned and they and they come. They say they come to see you and visit with you and and because they care about us, even on the spiritual side. So it's important for us to not only get to know the physical world and our grandparents, and we need to get to know that spiritual side as well. And that's how we one way Cree people and other indigenous cultures are able to do that.

</details>

### 克里语与文化传承

**主持人**: 您流利地说克里语，您的书中提到了能够用您的语言与人交流，以及有些人不能交流，以及因此建立的联系。对您和您的家人来说，能够说您的语言意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: You are fluent in Cree and you talk in your book of, you know, being able to speak to people in your language and some people who aren't able to and how that that there's some bonds that you make because of your fluency in it. What does it mean to you and your family that you are able to speak your language?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 对我来说，我感到非常幸运能够说我的语言。因为我遇到了很多不能说自己语言的人，我为他们感到非常难过，因为我知道他们正在努力重新联系，他们正在努力学习自己的语言。对于那些没有在语言环境中长大，没有听到它，也不能说它的人来说，这非常困难。我听到它，感觉就像一种哀悼，你知道，我能感受到那种感觉。所以我非常非常幸运能够学会我的语言。我认为很大一部分原因是，你知道，许多北部部落因为孤立而拥有非常强的语言保留能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: Well, for me, it's I feel like I'm very fortunate to be able to speak my language. And because I meet a lot of people who who are not able to speak their language, and I feel really bad for them because I know they're they're trying to reconnect, they're trying to learn their language. And it's it's very difficult for them not growing up around their language, not not hearing it and not able to speak it. And I hear that it's it's like a it's almost like a mourning, you know, like I feel that sort of it kind of give off that kind of feeling. So I'm just been very, very fortunate that I was able to learn my language. And I think a big part of that is because I, a lot of Far North bands are very they have very strong language retention because of the isolation.

</details>

### 教师与音乐家的融合

**主持人**: 你在谈论你的汗屋时，把自己描述成一个老师，但通过语言也是如此。我很想知道，你作为一名老师的职业与作为一名音乐家的身份是如何重叠的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: You sort of described yourself as a teacher when you talk about your sweat lodge, but even through language as well. And I'm curious, how does your vocation as a teacher overlap with being a musician?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 哦，好问题。我想。嗯，在音乐方面，我一直试图以一种方式去做。我的意思是，它有点政治驱动，但它一直都是这样。但我总是试图去，你知道，即使它不是关于非常积极的事情。但我总是试图在音乐中达到一个更好的境界。我相信它是为了每个人，你知道吗？就像这本书一样，我试图让这本书为每个人而写。所以，我一直试图以一种方式运用音乐。再次，只是那种我们都能理解并能产生共鸣的普遍主题。是的，我的意思是，音乐中有一些是教学，你知道，我们，我们谈论。我的一些歌曲谈论失落，你知道，我谈论一些歌曲是增加的。所以那些，那些是我认为会很好的歌曲。所以人们可以，你知道，学习唱韩语歌曲，同时他们也在学习他们的语言。所以。所以这些是我试图将音乐用作教学工具的一些方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: Oh good question. I think. Well, in the music, I've always tried to do it in a way. I mean, it's a little bit politically driven, but it's always been it's always been that way. But I always try to take, you know, maybe even if it's not about something that's very positive. But I always try to get to a better place with the music. I believe it's for everyone, you know? And like the book, I try to to make this book for everyone. And so I've always tried to use music in a way that is. Again, just sort of universal theme themes that we all can kind of understand and we can all relate to. And yeah, I mean, some of the music is teaching, you know, we, we talk about. And some of the songs I talk about loss, you know, I talk about some of the songs are increased. So those those are some of the songs I thought that would be really good to make. So people can, you know, learn to sing the song in Korean and they learn they are also learning at the same time about their language. So. So those are some of the ways I try to use music as, as teaching tools.

### 挑水：爱的行动

**主持人**: 你现在要跑了吗？这里没什么可藏的。哦。现在要跑了。这片土地很宝贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Are you gonna run to now? There ain't no hiding in here. Oh. Now it's gonna run to now. This land is precious.

</details>

**主持人**: 你描述从五岁起一直到现在挑水，作为一种爱的行动？告诉我那件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: You describing carrying water from the age of five up until today as an act of love? Tell me about that.

</details>

**Adrienne**: 嗯，从最早的时候起，我们就有这些小水桶，很小，我们在哈德逊湾（Hudson's Bay）买的。它们通常会放在那里。所以我们总有一个水桶用来装水，还有其他东西。我的祖母让我去打水来装满洗衣机，用于洗碗，你知道，洗澡，或者任何事情，就像日常事务一样。然后我们处理雪和冬天，我们在那些里面收集。我不知道你是否见过它们，但**加拿大邮政（Canada Post）**的袋子，它们通常是蓝色或橙色，颜色鲜艳，但我们使用它们，因为它们是聚酯纤维做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: Well, from the earliest age, we used to have these little pails that were small, and we bought them at the Hudson's Bay. They come. They usually lard in there. So we always had one for water and just carrying different things. So my grandma made me go get water to fill the washer for dishes and, and, you know, bathing or whatever, like a daily thing. And then we did snow and winter, which we collected in those. I don't know if you've ever seen them, but the Canada Post bag, they usually blue or orange and bright colours, but we use those because they're made of polyester.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以不会破。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: So won't break.

</details>

**Adrienne**: 是的，所以我们用它们，然后我们装满雪。我们冬天还有一个桶，我们把它放在路边。我的祖父在上面开了一个洞，我们用一个小杯子把它填满，因为它们能保持冰面开放，它们能在整个冬天保持冰面上的洞开放。所以我们可以，你知道，放冰，雪和水，然后我们把它们混合在一起。所以这就是我们的工作。我们在一个小雪车上做。所以，是的，工具种类繁多，你知道，用来收集水。但我记得那一直是我的工作，现在仍然是。你知道，我的工作，我的儿子们，现在是他们的工作，确保我们有水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: And yeah, so we use those and we fill them with snow. And we also had a barrel that we used in the winter that we would put down sideways. And we my grandfather cut a hole through the top and we'd fill that thing with a little cup because they keep the ice open, they keep a hole in the ice open all winter long. So we could, you know, put in ice, snow and water and we kind of mix it all together. So that was kind of our job. We do that on a little snow machine. So like yeah the tools sort of varied you know to collecting water. But it, it it was I remember it always being my job and it still is. You know, my job my sons, it's their job now to, to make sure that we have the water.

</details>

### 传递给下一代

**主持人**: 在你的书中，你谈到了这些关键时刻，比如打猎之类的事情，但即使是像取水这样简单的事情，我们也将其视为如此。那一刻你给你的儿子传达了什么信息？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Throughout your book you talk about sort of these key moments, one where you go hunting and stuff like that, but even something as simple as that, we look at here as something as simple as getting water. What's the message to your son in that moment?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 对我来说，这不仅仅是一个家务活，它是一种哲学。我认为我们进入其中是一种生活节奏，无论是建造还是用双手收获食物，我认为都与我们的双手有关。取水。是的，它在体力上要求很高，而且确实感觉像是一种不便。有些日子会有排队。这是我们必须做的事情。对我们来说，那不是一个选择。即使有些日子很难，很难强迫自己，你知道，如果你得了流感，你仍然需要去取水，你知道，你得了几天流感，你仍然需要去。就像，不，我好了再说。不。你得起床去拿。这是我接受的事情。即使有时非常困难。我仍然认为我在那里过着非常美好的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: Well, for me, it's it's not just like a chore, it's a philosophy. And I think it's a rhythm of life that we get into up there, whether it's building or we harvest something to eat with our hands, it's always something to do with our hands, I think. Getting water. Yeah, it's it's physically demanding and it's it is it does feel like an inconvenience. And some days there's a Line-up. It's something that we do because we have to do it. It's not a choice for us up there. And even though it's difficult some days to to push yourself to, to make sure, you know, if you're if you're down with the flu, like you got to get water still like, you know, you're down with the flu for a few days, you still got to go and do it. Like it's not like, no, I'm going to do it when I'm better. No. It's like, you got to get up and go get it. It's something I accept. And even though it's very hard at times. I still think I live a very beautiful life up there.

</details>

### Attawapiskat的变迁与不变

**主持人**: 你在成长过程中以及在**Attawapiskat**的成长经历，与现在相比，可能发生了很大的变化。你能告诉我们一点吗？你所看到的，永远是家的地方，永远是你的家，它发生了很大的变化吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: A lot has probably changed from how you grew up and where you grew up in Attawapiskat, to what it is now. Can you tell us a little bit? Is is there a big change in sort of what you see that is always home, that will always be home for you, but has it changed a lot?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 是的，变化是有的。但从某些方面来说，我觉得我们仍然生活在石器时代，或者仍然生活在石器时代。但我想，确实发生了变化。我的意思是，水质得到了改善，你知道，从我小时候没有自来水，直到大约 95、90、98 年，我想我们家才通了水管。所以在此之前我们没有任何东西。所以是的，确实发生了变化。但我的意思是，很多很多年里，你永远不能喝顶层的水。你知道，水就像毒药。人们也在里面洗澡。**加拿大卫生部（Health Canada）**给我们的信息和建议是，不要在那种水里洗澡超过两分钟，你知道，不要吸入自来水中的蒸汽。所以当你听到这些时，你就会想，什么？这里发生了什么？我认为任何人都会觉得这非常令人担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: There's been yeah, there's been there's been change. In some ways though, I feel like we still we still live in a stone age or still living in the Stone Age. But but there has been change, I think. I mean, the water has improved, the water quality has improved, you know, from having no running water as a kid up until it was like 95, 90, 98, I think we got plumbed, our house got plumbed. So we we didn't have anything prior to that. So yes, there has there have been changes. But I mean, you could never drink the water from the top like for, for many, many, many years. You know, the water is like poison drinking poison. So and you know, people bathe in that. And the information, the advice we were getting from Health Canada was do not bathe longer than two minutes in that water, you know, don't breathe the vapours from the water tap. So when you hear those kinds of things, you're just like, what? Like what is going on here? Anyone, I think, would find that very, very alarming.

</details>

**主持人**: 确实如此。不幸的是，这些是很多人读到的头条新闻。但我想知道，你希望人们如何看待Attawapiskat？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: With that. Those unfortunately, those are the headlines that a lot of people read. But I'm curious, what do you want people to know Attawapiskat for?

</details>

**Adrienne**: 我们不是在寻求救援。我们是自己生活的主动参与者。而且，你知道，我认为我们正在生存。我们都在那里以一种生存的节奏生活。我们拥有关于如何在土地上生存的大量知识。我认为我们那里的大多数人选择住在那里，因为我们热爱这种生活方式。正如我之前提到的，你可以过一种非常艰难的生活，但同时你也可以过一种非常美好的生活。这两种情况可以并存，我热爱与土地的连接。我热爱克里文化，克里传统。这就是我为什么在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: We're not asking to be rescued. We're active participants in our own lives. And, you know, I think we are surviving. We we all are in a rhythm of survival up there. We we have a wealth of knowledge about how to survive on the land. And I think most of us that are up there choose to live there because we love the lifestyle. As I mentioned earlier, you can live a very hard life, but you can also have a very beautiful life at the same time. Those two things can coexist and I love the connection to the land. I love the Cree culture, the Cree tradition. That's why I'm there.

</details>

**主持人**: Adrienne，我们就此打住。非常感谢您。我真的很感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Adrienne, we're going to leave it there. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

</details>

**Adrienne**: 我不为我来自哪里感到羞耻。我昂首挺胸，追逐梦想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrienne**: I ain't ashamed of where I came from. I hold my head up high and dream.
