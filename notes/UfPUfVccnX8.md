### 更年期的污名与影响

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您正在收听 Mistreated。我是**Nam Kiwanuka**。直到最近，**更年期**仍然是朋友和亲密之人之间窃窃私语的话题。在不礼貌的场合，它被称为“那个变化”。如果你正在经历这个变化，就有一种不言而喻的秘密，不能说出来。这种污名在某些社区仍然存在。但在2024年，奥斯卡获奖女演员**哈莉·贝瑞**（**Halib Berry**）帮助打破了这种沉默。在国会山，她宣称：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You're listening to Mistreated. I'm **Nam Kiwanuka**. Until recently, menopause was a whisper between friends and trusted ones. Impolite company. It was called the change. And if you were going through this change, there was an unspoken secrecy about saying that you were. This stigma still exists in some communities. But in 2024, Oscar winning actress **Halib Berry** helped to shatter that silence. While on Capitol Hill, she declared that

</details>

**Halib Berry**: 我正处于**更年期**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Halib Berry**: I'M IN MENOPAUSE.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 好的，**更年期**的羞耻感必须被消除。我们必须谈论我们生命中这个非常正常的部分。我们的医生甚至不能对我们说出这个词，更不用说引导我们度过这段旅程了。根据**耶鲁医学院**的定义，**更年期**是指连续12个月没有月经。但许多人没有意识到卵巢功能在**更年期**到来之前很久就开始衰退，有些情况下甚至提前10年。这个过渡期被称为**围绝经期**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Okay, the shame has to be taken out of menopause. We have to talk about this very normal part of our life that happens. Our doctors can't even say the word to us, let alone walk us through the journey. According to the **Yale Medical School**, menopause is defined by 12 consecutive months without a period. But many people don't recognize that ovarian function begins to decline long before menopause, even in some cases up to 10 years earlier. This transition time is called perry menopause.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **更年期**过渡不仅仅是**潮热**和健忘。根据学术和研究界的独立在线出版物**The Conversation**的数据，高达80%的女性会出现与**雌激素**、**孕酮**和**睾酮**水平下降相关的症状。研究人员已经识别出超过40种可能的症状。由于**雌激素**作用于全身的受体，它的流失与**骨质疏松症**、**心脏病**、**糖尿病**和**情绪障碍**等长期健康问题风险增加有关。虽然预计到2030年，**更年期**市场价值将达到6000亿美元，但许多正在经历这一过渡期的女性仍然无法获得所需的护理。在今天的节目中，我们采访了**温迪·沃尔夫曼医生**（**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**），她是加拿大的一位先驱，也是国际知名的**更年期**专家。我们与她探讨了她为何成为医生、**更年期**的污名、女性健康护理的不足，以及计划于2027年开放的**成熟女性中心**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: The menopause transition is more than just hot flashes and forgetfulness. According to **The Conversation**, an independent online publication from the academic and research community, up to 80% of women develop symptoms linked to falling levels of **estrogen**, **progesterone**, and **testosterone**. Researchers have identified more than 40 possible symptoms. Because **estrogen** acts on receptors throughout the body, its loss is associated with increased risks of long-term health issues such as **osteoporosis**, **heart disease**, **diabetes**, and **mood disorders**. While the menopause market is expected to be worth $600 billion by 2030, many going through the transition still lack access to getting the care they need. On today's episode, we speak to **Dr. Wendy Wolfman**, a pioneer in Canada and an internationally renowned menopause expert. We speak to her about why she became a doctor, the stigma of menopause, and the lack of care for women in health, and about the center for mature women, which is set to open in 2027.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 她说，这个中心是“梦想成真”。**沃尔夫曼医生**现在加入我们。**温迪·沃尔夫曼医生**，非常感谢您抽出时间与我们交谈。请您自我介绍一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: The center she says is a quote dream realized. **Dr. Wolfman** joins me now. **Dr. Wendy Wolfman**, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. Could you introduce yourself, please?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我是**温迪·沃尔夫曼**。我是**Weston Oborn成熟女性健康和过早卵巢功能不全中心**的主任。我是妇产科系的教授，也是第一位**卡罗尔·米切尔**（**Carol Mitchell**）**更年期**讲席教授。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: I'm **Wendy Wolfman**. I'm director of the **Weston Oborn Center for Mature Women's Health and Premature Ovarian Insufficiency**. I'm a professor in the department of abstetrics and gynecology and the first **Carol Mitchell** chair in menopause.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您的职业生涯非常出色。您不仅在加拿大，而且在全球都是一位开拓者。我想和您谈谈您的旅程，以及您是如何走到现在所做的工作的。您从小是如何被教导女性健康的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You have had a phenomenal career. You're a trailblazer not just in Canada but globally. Um I wanted to talk to you maybe about your journey and how you came to do the work that you are doing right now. What were you taught about women's health when you were growing up?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 不多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Not much

</details>

### 投身女性健康的历程

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 但我来自一个可能不像大家说的那样典型的家庭。我的父亲在28岁时患了**脊髓灰质炎**，行动不便。那时我真的认识到健康比其他任何事情都重要。但我想我们专注于生存，我的母亲和他一起做所有事情，从不抱怨。所以她从未谈论过**围绝经期**可能出现的那些症状。我不得不说，我们经历的任何事情与我父亲所经历的相比都显得苍白无力。所以，在我成长过程中，我想我们根本没有谈论过这些。我们在学校里可能学到了一点关于青春期的知识，但没有关于**更年期**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: but then I came from a family um which maybe wasn't the typical family just like everybody says. Um, my father had polio when he was 28 and he was mobility impaired and really I recognized at that time that health was more important than anything else. But I think we concentrated on survival and my mother did everything with him. um never complained and so she really never talked about those symptoms that may have occurred in the pmenopause and I have to say that anything that we experienced seemed to pale besides what my father had gone through. So growing up I don't think we talked at all about that. We got a little bit maybe in school about um uh puberty, nothing about menopause

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 而且它也没有被谈论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: and it wasn't talked about.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您是如何以及为何成为一名医生的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: How and why did you become a doctor?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我想那是我成为医生的主要原因，我看到了健康如何影响我家庭生活的方方面面，包括社会和经济方面，他们为一切付出了多少努力。那时对有明显残疾的人真的存在歧视，我不想让任何其他家庭经历这些。所以，我成长在一个女性被赋予前所未有的特权的时代。在我的家庭中，我的父母是出色的父母，他们以各种方式鼓励我，对我作为一个女人能做什么没有任何限制。然后，多伦多的加拿大教育系统非常出色，我在公立学校系统接受了很好的教育，甚至大学，如果我在夏天找到工作并获得奖学金，那也不是我无法承受的负担。然后，作为一个好学生，我考入了所有我申请的学校，所以，这真的是一个过程。我想我直到进入医学院，试图决定我想做什么时，才真正定义了女性健康。我很年轻就结婚了，我的丈夫一直支持我。他也是一名医生，我在本科时曾与**沃尔利弗医生**（**Dr. Woliver**）合作，在生殖激素方面做了一些基础科学研究，我是一个喜欢弄清楚一切的人，我觉得那非常引人入胜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: I think that was the major reason is I I saw how health affected every aspect of my family's life socially, economically, um how hard they had to work for everything. um the really the discrimination at that time of people who had a visible disability and I didn't want any other family to have to go through that. And so um I also grew up at a time when women were being given privileges that they had never been before. And so also in within my family, my father and mother were wonderful parents and really encouraged me in any way they could and there was no limitation in terms of what I could do as a woman. And then the Canadian uh education system in Toronto um was excellent and I received a wonderful education in the public school system and even university if I got a job in the summer got scholarships it wasn't uh really a burden that I couldn't accomplish and then being a good student I got into all the schools I applied for and um so I I just it it It's really a process. I think that I didn't really define women's health per se until um really I got into medical school trying to decide what I want to do. Um I got married at a very young age and my husband was always a support to me. He's also a physician and I had in undergrad worked with **Dr. Woliver** at that time and had done some basic science in the uh reproductive hormones and I being a person who really liked to figure out everything um I really thought that was fascinating.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这就是您选择妇产科的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And is that why you chose obstetrics and gynecology?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我想那是一部分原因，然后我做了一年的内科医生。我结婚后搬家了，我考入了**多伦多大学**，但后来我搬到卡尔加里，从**卡尔加里大学**医学院毕业。我做了一年的内科医生，因为我以为我会通过内科做生殖内分泌学，但后来我意识到我不太习惯照顾男性，所以，我决定通过妇产科来做。然后你真的会被怀孕、分娩、我相当好的动手能力、妇科手术方面所吸引一段时间，但后来我意识到有一整群女性没有得到关注。就好像女性的生命在她们进入绝经后就停止了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Well, I think that was part of it and then I did a year of internal medicine. I had after I got married I moved I got into the **University of Toronto** but then I moved to Calgary graduated from the **University of Calgary** in medicine and I did a year of internal medicine because I thought I would do reproductive endocrinology through internal medicine but then I realized I wasn't really comfortable looking after men and so uh I decided to do that through OBGYn and then you really get seduced for a time with um pregnancy, birth, uh I had quite good manual dexterity, the surgical aspects of gynecology, but then I realized that there was this whole group of women that were not being addressed. It was almost as if women's lives stopped when they became post-reroductive.

</details>

### 发现护理空白

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 当时我在**UHN**，多伦多，那里有一位名叫**普伦基特医生**（**Dr. Plunkett**）的生殖内分泌学家，他为老年女性开设了一个非常小的诊所，那里有点像妇产科医生处理那些抱怨**潮热**和阴道干涩的女性的“失败者”场所。换句话说，那些被认为是装病的女性。这几乎被归咎于此。我当时想，嗯，这肯定不止于此。所以我开始参加会议，我当时想，哇，这太棒了。这太迷人了。看看**更年期**周围正在发生的所有变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And when I was at uh **UHN** at that time um um Toronto um there was a doctor there named **Dr. Plunkett** and he was a reproductive endocrinologist and he had started a very small clinic for aging women and it was sort of the loser place where OBGYn went for women who were complaining about their hot flashes and their vaginal dryness. In other words, women that were malingering. It was almost attributed to that. And I I thought, well, there's got to be more to this than that. And so I started to go to meetings and I got I I thought, wow, this is amazing. It's fascinating. Look at all the changes that are occurring around menopause.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 有这样一种观念，当你经历**更年期**时，就像你在抱怨一样。你只是，你知道，不够坚强。这都是你自己的问题。那么，您能带我回到那一刻吗？当您意识到，等等，这里有一些我们应该研究的东西，以及您的好奇心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: There's this idea that when you're going through paramount, it's like you're complaining. You're just, you know, not tough enough. It's all in your head. So can you take me back to that moment when you realized wait a minute there is something here that we should um research and your curiosity.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我想我认识到在知识和护理方面存在巨大差距，而且我也意识到人们寿命越来越长，我们现在知道女性在**更年期**后会度过她们生命中高达40%的时间。而且，我认为这是一个演变过程，女性已经进入职场，我们是劳动力中非常重要的成员，培养技能需要数年时间才能达到各自领域的顶峰。而对于那些症状非常严重的女性，她们无法正常工作。因此，我们大约有10%的女性会因为**更年期**症状而辞职。现在，对于**围绝经期**，也就是最后一次月经前一年左右发生的所有变化，人们也越来越着迷。**骨质流失**加速，**血脂**发生变化，**血压**发生变化。我们才刚刚开始了解其中一些变化，因为女性健康研究直到1990年代才真正开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Well, I think I recognized that there was a huge gap in knowledge as well as care and um I also realized that people were living longer and we now know that women live up to 40% of their lives after menopause and also I think this has been an evolution that you know women have gone to the work place and we are very vital members of the workforce and it takes takes years to develop the skills um to get to the top of your fields and then for women who really have terrible symptoms, they can't function. And so we're losing approximately 10% of women will quit their job because of menopausal symptoms. And for now also there's fascination with all the changes that are occurring around the perry menopause in the year before the last menstrual period. There's an acceleration of bone loss. There's changes in your lipids. There's changes in your blood pressure. We're just beginning to understand some of these changes because really women's health research didn't start until the 1990s.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我的意思是，当你想到这一点时，这令人震惊。所以我认识到这个差距，我强烈地认为这是错误的，女性的生活质量正受到这种知识缺乏的影响。女性为我们的国家、家庭、伴侣、孩子贡献良多。我们是社会的支柱。当我们无法正常工作时，社会也无法正常运转。嗯，你知道，坚强的女性为每个人都在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Um, I mean that's appalling when you think about it. And so I I recognized this gap and I felt very strongly that it was wrong and that the quality of women's lives was being affected by this lack of knowledge. And women contribute so much to our countries, our families, our partners, our children. We're the backbone of society. And when we can't function, then society doesn't function. Um, you know, strong women are there for everyone.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 然后我个人也意识到了这一点。如果我去商店，我会被忽视，因为我年纪大了。我终于赚够了钱去购买商品，但我却被忽视了。我在想这些销售人员，你们为什么要忽视我，我也很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And then I personally also realized it. If I went to a store, I was ignored because I was older. I finally had earned enough money to buy the products and I'm being ignored. And I'm thinking to these salespeople, why are you ignoring me like I count too?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以这是一种歧视。即使是今天我也看到了。我走在走廊上，一个年轻人从我身边走过，好像我不存在一样，因为我年纪大了。我认为也存在这种微妙的歧视。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And so it's a type of discrimination. Even I see it now today. I was walking on the hallway, a young man walked past me as if I didn't exist because I'm older. And I think there's that subtle discrimination that's occurring as well.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我很高兴您谈到了它如何影响我们的整体健康，因为如果您去看医生，或者如果社会告诉您，一旦您达到某个年龄，您就不再有价值了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I'm glad that you talked about how it impacts our overall health because if you go to a doctor or if society tells you that once you hit a certain age that you're no longer of value

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 然后您开始感觉不同，并且出现这些症状，我想没有人希望被认为是抱怨，但随后您被置于一个必须为自己争取权益的境地，当您与医生交谈时，然后您可能会开始觉得，好吧，这是我自己的问题，是我的错，我只需要在精神上更坚强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: and then you start to feel different and you have these symptoms and I don't think anybody wants to come off as I'm complaining but then you're put in a a position to have to advocate for yourself when you're talking to the doctors and then maybe you start to feel a bit like okay it's me it's my problem it's my fault I just need to be mentally stronger.

</details>

### 症状的生理学验证

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我完全同意您的看法，我认为当女性强烈表达意见时，她们被解读为愤怒而不是自信，我认为这是我们社会以及我们对待女性方式的一个问题。嗯，所以我想在我的一生中，我真的看到了对这些症状的尊重发生了演变。其中一部分可能是2000年代初期**潮热**机制的发现。所以我们现在知道，人们出现**潮热**，这是**更年期**最常见的症状之一，是因为大脑中的恒温器受到不适当的刺激。作为哺乳动物，你必须将体温保持在狭窄的范围内。我在二年级时就学到了这一点，这是哺乳动物与其他动物的区别。当你的大脑这个区域没有**雌激素**时，它会不适当地受到刺激，发出“太热了，太热了，太热了”的信号。然后你的身体会发生生理变化，通过出汗让你降温。这涉及到心率的变化，血管的变化。这不是一个微不足道的事件。如果一个女人一天有20次这样的情况，顺便说一下，大多数女性在佩戴体温监测器时，并不会抱怨她们所经历的所有体温变化。嗯，所以你可以理解这会如何影响一个女人，她的功能能力，如果它们整夜发生，会影响她的睡眠，我们知道睡眠很重要，以及这如何影响日常功能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: I absolutely agree with you and I think when women express opinions strongly, they're interpreted to be angry rather than assertive and I I think that's a problem with our society and how we approach women in general. Um, so I think over my lifetime I've really seen an evolution in respect for these symptoms. Part of that was the discovery probably in the early 2000s of uh the mechanism for hot flashes. So we now know that the reason people get a hot flash, which is one of the most common symptoms of the menopause, is because there's an inappropriate stimulation of your uh thermostat in your brain. And being a mammal, you're obligated to keep your temperature within a narrow range. And I learned that in grade two that that's differentiates mammals from other types of animals. And this area of your brain when you don't have estrogen there is inappropriately being stimulated saying too hot, too hot, too hot. And then your body under goes physiologic changes to make you cool off by sweating. And that involves changes in your heart rate, changes in your blood vessels. And this is not a trivial event. And if a woman is having like 20 of these a day, and most women, by the way, when you put them in temperature monitors, don't complain of all the changes in temperature that they're having. Um, so you can appreciate how that would affect a woman, her ability to function, and if they're occurring all night, her sleep, which we know is important, and how that impacts daily function.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我认为这种机制的发现对医生来说真正验证了这些症状并非装病，而是生理性的，而且并非像以前所认为的那样只是女性的心理作用。所以我想科学已经进步了。我认为女性更加积极发声，而且我认为对**妇女健康倡议**（**Women's Health Initiative**，简称**WHI**）的重新评估也很重要，这项2002年的研究曾指出，对所有女性进行**激素疗法**（hormone therapy）非常危险，并增加了**心血管疾病**和**乳腺癌**的风险，这吓坏了医生和女性。当时甚至有针对开具**激素疗法**的医生的诉讼，如果女性因此患上**乳腺癌**。所以，我认为我们已经取得了长足的进步。我们现在对**激素疗法**有了更多的了解。对**WHI**的重新评估表明，实际上对于50到59岁之间症状最严重的女性群体，服用**激素疗法**是非常安全的，而且益处大于风险。但再次强调，这是一种个性化处方。必须根据女性完整的家族史、她自身的风险因素以及她是否是合适的候选人来单独确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And I think the discovery of this mechanism for physicians really validated these symptoms as not malingering as being physiologic and not I mean it is in women's heads but not in the same way that had been attributed before and so I think the science has improved. I think women are more viciferous and I think the re-evaluation of the **Women's Health Initiative** which was that study in 2002 that said that hormone therapy for all women was very dangerous and increased the risk of not only um cardiovascular disease but breast cancer scared physicians as well as women. Um, and there were even lawsuits against physicians for prescribing hormone therapy at that time if women developed breast cancer. So, I think we've come a long way. We now know more about hormone therapy. A re-evaluation of the **WHI** shows that actually for women between 50 and 59 who are the group that have the most symptoms um that actually taking hormone therapy is very safe and that the benefits outweigh the risks. But again, it's an individual prescription. Uh has to be determined individually looking at a woman's complete family history, her own risk factors, and whether she's a good candidate.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我很高兴您谈到了这一点，因为关于是否可以服用**HRT**（激素替代疗法）有很多困惑，现在人们也在把这个名字改为**更年期**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I'm so glad you spoke about that because there's so much confusion about uh if you can take um **HRT** and now I there's also um people are changing the name to menopause

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: **激素疗法**（hormone therapy），我们把**激素替代疗法**（hormone replacement therapy）这个词保留给40岁以下患有**过早卵巢功能不全**的女性，我们以前认为这占人口的1%，但实际上高达3.7%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: hormone therapy and we reserve hormone replacement therapy for women under 40 who develop premature ovarian insufficiency which we used to think was 1% of the population but actually is as high as 3.7%.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我们知道这些女性绝对需要服用某种形式的激素，否则她们会更早患上**心脏病**，以及更早出现**骨骼变化**、更早出现**认知变化**。如果她们没有得到应有的激素补充，她们将面临长期健康问题的风险，这些激素是她们如果没有提前进入**更年期**本应拥有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Um and we know that those women absolutely need to take some form of hormone or they will have earlier heart disease and um earlier bone change, earlier cognitive change. They're at risk for long-term health issues if they not replaced with the hormone that they would have had if they hadn't developed menopause earlier.

</details>

### 激素疗法与健康评估

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **FDA**最近取消了**激素替代疗法**的黑框警告。您能澄清一下女性接下来应该怎么做吗？显然，是在与她们的医生交谈之后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: The **FDA** recently took the black box of hormone replacement therapy. Can you clarify on what women should be doing moving forward? Obviously, after they speak to their practitioner.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 所以，我们很高兴黑框警告被取消了。它曾吓坏了很多女性不敢接受**激素疗法**，但我认为再次强调，这必须结合**激素疗法**的类型来看待。我们有阴道产品，用于治疗我们称之为**绝经期泌尿生殖系统综合征**的症状，这些是由于缺乏**雌激素**而在阴道、外阴、阴道和膀胱支持以及性功能方面发生的变化。50%的女性在**更年期**三年内出现症状，70%的女性在70岁时出现症状。这些**雌激素**产品的效力仅为全身**激素疗法**的千分之一。所以它只是一点点**雌激素**，并且在阴道局部起作用。因此，现在有许多研究表明，阴道**雌激素**对心脏没有长期影响，也不会增加**乳腺癌**的风险。它不足以治疗全身症状。嗯，它确实是一种局部产品，在局部起作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: So, we were very happy that the black box was removed. It scared a lot of women to take hormone therapy, but I think again it has to be looked at with the type of hormone therapy. So we have vaginal products which are utilized for symptoms of um what we call general urinary syndrome of menopause which are the changes that occur in the vagina, the vulva um the supports to the vagina and the bladder and sexuality based on lack of estrogen and 50% of women have symptoms within three years of menopause and 70% of women have symptoms by the age of 70. Those estrogen products are 1 1,000th the potency of systemic hormone therapy. So it's a teeny tiny bit of estrogen and it works locally in the vagina. And so there are now multiple studies showing that there are no long-term effects of vaginal estrogens on heart on um it doesn't it's not enough for treatment of symptoms um for risk of breast cancer. Um it really is a local product working locally.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: **全身性激素疗法**现在在美国也取消了黑框警告。嗯，对我们许多人来说，我们认为这是好事。但我们仍然认为，开具这种疗法的医生应该尊重**全身性疗法**，并认识到**激素疗法**的使用是基于个人的家族史、既往史、个人风险因素的个性化处方。然后，您选择如何开具处方可能由您的健康风险决定。我确实认为应该进行**更年期健康评估**。我们甚至没有**更年期**的收费代码，这阻碍了医生花费必要的时间来评估**更年期**女性。我为什么要这么说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Systemic hormone therapy now had the blackbox removed in the US as well. Um, for many of us, we think that's good. But we still think that the person or the people who are prescribing that therapy should treat systemic therapy with respect and recognize that the use of hormone therapy um is an individual prescription based on the person's family history, their past history, um their own personal risk factors. And then the choice of how you decide to prescribe it may be determined by your health risks. I do believe that there should be a menopausal health assessment. We don't even have a fee code for menopause and this dissuades physicians from spending the amount of time that is necessary to evaluate a menopausal woman. Why do I say that?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我这么说是因为我认为我们可以识别女性在**更年期**前后，以及**更年期**后许多健康问题的风险因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: I say it because I think we can identify the risk factors for women going forward after menopause around menopause for many health problems.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 例如，识别有**结肠癌**风险的人，如果她们有家族史，可能更容易患**乳腺癌**的人。嗯，所以首先识别这些遗传风险，然后查看女性的病史，包括她的生活方式。嗯，我们知道**美国心脏协会**有八个健康心脏习惯，包括体重正常化、**血压**正常化、血糖、**血脂**、**地中海饮食**、定期锻炼、不吸烟和睡眠。如果你能将所有这些都正常化，那么你就有可能拥有非常好的**心血管健康**，这是女性随着年龄增长的主要杀手。所以我认为重申这些事情并向女性强调它们非常重要。如果女性有严重的症状，我们知道这会使她面临某些健康问题的更大风险。我们有这些好的疗法。我们有**激素疗法**。我们现在有一些优秀的非**激素疗法**。嗯，以及决定这种激素是口服还是通过皮肤给药。嗯，哪种**孕酮**最能预防子宫癌，这种癌症来自对仍有子宫的女性给予的未受刺激的**雌激素**。嗯，这些都需要一点技巧。

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: So for instance identifying the person who's at risk for colon cancer, the person who might be more at risk for breast cancer if they have a family history. Um so identifying first of all those genetic risks then looking at a woman's history um in terms of her lifestyle. Um, we know that there are the **American Heart Association** eight healthy heart habits and that includes normalizing weight, normalizing blood pressure, blood sugar, lipids, **Mediterranean diet**, regular exercise, not smoking, and sleep. And if you can normalize all those things, then you will potentially have very good cardiovascular health, which is a major killer of women as they get older. So I think reiterating those things and emphasizing them to women is very important. If the woman's having symptoms like severe symptoms, we know that that puts her more at risk um for certain health problems. And we have these good therapies. We have the hormonal therapies. We now have some excellent non hormonal therapies. Um and the decision of whether that hormone can be given orally or through the skin. Um what type of progesterine is best to prevent uterine cancer that comes from unstimul un um opposed estrogen given to women who still have a uterus. Um those require a little bit of skill.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 当人们谈论**更年期**过渡时，就好像，“哦，这只是一次**潮热**。”就好像，这是一种可爱的，只是一种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: When people talk about the menopause transition, it's like, "Oh, it's just a hot flash." Like, it's something that's cutesy, that's just something that is not

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 它被轻视了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: it's trivialized.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: That's the way,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 对吧？对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: right? Right.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我想我已经解释过它并非微不足道。那实际上是一个生理事件。如果你从统计学上看，大约70%或80%的女性有一些症状。20%没有。根据你阅读的研究，20%到40%的女性至少有中度到重度症状。那么，重度症状意味着什么？它意味着女性必须停止她正在做的事情。她无法继续。症状对她来说是如此具有破坏性，以至于她无法进行日常生活。嗯，有些女性有轻微症状或没有症状，她们不知道人们在谈论什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And I I think I've explained that it's not trivial. That actually is a physiologic event. If you look statistically, about 70% of women or 80% have some symptoms. 20% do not. And depending on the study that you read, 20 to 40% of women have at least moderate to severe symptoms. Now, what does a severe symptom mean? It means that the woman has to stop what she's doing. She can't continue on. The symptom is so disruptive for her that she can't carry on her daily life. Um, some women have mild symptoms or no symptoms and they don't know what people are talking about.

### 成熟女性健康中心

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您能向我们介绍一下**成熟女性健康中心**是什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Can you talk to us about what the center for mature women's health is?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，在我生命的尽头和职业生涯的末期，能够实现一个梦想，这真是太棒了。嗯，从历史上看，大约在2010年，我有一位心存感激的病人，她像天使一样来到我身边，问我想做什么，想如何做出改变。我说，哦，我希望能有一个**成熟女性健康中心**。我向她和她的丈夫提出了一个方案，他们为建立一个讲席教授职位提供了很好的启动资金。然后她和我一起筹集了300万美元，用于设立第一个临床**成熟女性健康**讲席教授职位。她的名字叫**卡罗尔·米切尔**。值得庆幸的是，她仍然和我们在一起，并且仍然相信这个项目，这也是她的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Well, this has been amazing towards the end of my life and my career to actually have a dream realized and um historically what happened in 200 uh about 20101 I had a grateful patient who came like an angel and said to me what would you like to do and make a difference and I said oh I'd love to have a mature women's health center and I made a a pitch to her and her husband and they gave us a nice seed for um establishing a chair and then she and I together raised $3 million um towards uh a the first clinical uh chair in mature women's health. Her name was **Carol Mitchell**. She's still with us thankfully and still believed in this and this has been a goal for her as well.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 随后，我的系主任**马修·瑟默**（**Matthew Surmer**）也认识到这很重要，所以他成为医院层面的倡导者，并与董事会接洽。**马克斯汀·格拉诺夫斯基**（**Maxine Granowski**）是董事会主席，董事会决定将此作为医院的一个重点领域。他们进行了全球范围的搜索，我被选为中心主任。然后发生的是，他们为**成熟女性健康中心**设定了5200万美元的目标，我当时想，我们永远也做不到，我会在实现这个目标之前就死了。但出乎意料的是，由于我们医院出色的捐助者，以及我们伟大的基金会和所有人的共同努力，顺便说一句，我们付出了很多努力，在两年内我们筹集了5200万美元，没有人会相信。最后两笔捐款以中心命名，即**Weston Oborn成熟女性健康中心**，我们正在开始制定计划，以实际建立一个实体场所。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Subsequently, my department chair uh **Matthew Surmer** um recognized this also as something important and so he became an advocate at the hospital level approached the board. Uh **Maxine Granowski** was head of the board and the board decided to make this an area of interest for the hospital. They did a wa worldwide search and I was chosen as the director of the center and um then what happened is they set a goal of $52 million towards a mature women's health center and I thought uh we're never going to do this like I I'll be dead and gone before this is achieved and lo and behold due to the wonderful donors from our hospital as well as our great foundation and all the people working together and a lot of work on our part by the way. Um within two years we raised $52 million and no one would have believed it. The last two donations are named for the center, the **Weston Oborn Center for Mature Women's Health**, and we're starting to make the plans, um, to actually see a physical site.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 所以，嗯，我们认为这个中心对世界来说是独一无二的，是全球**成熟女性**的榜样。现在我是**国际更年期协会**的董事会成员，并且周游世界，与这些鼓舞人心的同事合作，我知道我们目前拥有我在这段时间内开发的最好的中心之一。我们有一个针对**乳腺癌**幸存者的诊所，针对患有**移植物抗宿主病**的女性，患有**特纳综合征**的患者。我们有2200名患者正在等待就诊，我们有多个日期接待**更年期**患者。嗯，我们设想这个诊所将拥有七个卓越诊所，包括**更年期**和**过早卵巢功能不全**。我们拥有加拿大唯一一个针对这群无人谈论的女性的诊所，我很乐意详细与您谈谈这一点。嗯，还有患有**异常子宫出血**的女性，这是**围绝经期**非常常见的症状。嗯，**性健康诊所**也可能没有得到充分关注。**妇科泌尿学**，嗯，**尿失禁**和**膀胱问题**影响着许多老年女性。嗯，然后，嗯，还有**外阴疾病**，这在女性中非常常见，我们有一位**外阴专家**和我们在一起，还有**阿曼达·塞尔克**（**Amanda Selk**），她在全国都很有名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And so, um, we've perceived as a center to be really something unique for the world, an example for mature women around the world. Now that I'm on the board of the **International Menopause Society** and have traveled all around the world and work with these inspiring colleagues, I know that we have one of the best centers currently uh that I've developed over this time frame. Uh we have a clinic for breast cancer survivors, for women who have graph versus host, patients who have Turner's disease. uh we have 2,200 patients waiting to see us and we have multiple days where we see menopausal patients. Um and how we perceive this clinic is to have seven clinics of excellence including menopause premature ovarian insufficiency. We have the only clinic in Canada for this group of women who no one talks about and that's I'd love to speak to you at detail about this. Um also women with abnormal uterine bleeding that's a very common presenting problem in the perry menopause. Uh sexuality clinic also not probably addressed. Eurog gynecology the um incontinence and bladder issues affects so many women with aging. Um and then um also vulvver disease which is very common in women and we have a vulvver expert with us and also uh **Amanda Selk** who is really nationally known.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我们将进行跨学科合作，我们已经开始与医院内部的人员就**骨质疏松症**进行沟通，**骨质疏松症**是女性随着年龄增长而出现的问题，还有**精神问题**，因为我们知道这也是一个经过验证的**更年期**症状，即**更年期**前后的**情绪变化**。嗯，然后，嗯，我们还与**神经内科**建立了联系，因为我们知道**认知改变**在女性中更常见，我们想知道它是否真的始于**更年期**？这是否与**激素变化**和**更年期**症状有关？这些事情都非常令人兴奋，能够参与所有这些倡议以及许多其他跨学科合作伙伴。嗯，所以这就是我们希望实现的目标。嗯，希望我们能在2027年底前完成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: We're going to have interdisiplinary and we've already started talking to people within our hospital for osteoporosis which becomes a problem as women age psychiatric issues because we know that that's also a validated menopausal symptoms is mood change around menopause. Um and then uh we also have an association with neurology because we know cognitive change uh occurs more often in women and we want to know does it really start around menopause? Is this related to hormonal change to the symptoms of menopause and these things are being uh so exciting really to be involved with all these initiatives and many others interdisciplinary partners. Um, and so this is what we hope to achieve. Um, and hopefully we've had a finish date by the end of 2027.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 所以我们希望我们能做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: So we hope that we'll be able to do that.

### 个人使命与医疗理念

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我回想起您小时候的家庭，您的父亲患有**脊髓灰质炎**，以及他所面临的歧视。而您在最安静的时刻，看到自己的梦想得以实现，您正在为这么多人发声。这对您个人意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I think back to your family from when you were a young child and your father had polio and the discrimination that he faced and to for you to see your dream realized in your quietest moments having that dream realized where you are advocating for so many people. Uh what does this mean to you personally?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 你知道，我，我，我感谢你这样来描述，因为我真的没有太多考虑过这一点。我只是那种去做事情的人。但是是的，它确实给了我，嗯，我感到满足。我感到荣幸。嗯，我觉得我母亲一直希望的，并真正灌输给我的，就是让生活变得更美好。如果你在这里，在这个星球上，我们都应该努力实现改变，为了全人类的福祉。我确实觉得自己做出了一些小小的贡献，但我感谢你的好意。来自一个社会化的医疗系统，尽管它有各种缺点，但它最棒的一点是，当你进来时，我们不会查看你的保险，每个人都希望能得到尊重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: You know, I I I thank you for framing it that way because I don't I don't really think that much about that. I just am sort of a person who goes and and does it. But yes, it does give me um I feel fulfilled. I feel honored. Um I feel that what my mother always wanted and was really imbued in me is to make life a better place. if you're here and you're on this planet that we all should try and achieve uh change for the betterment of really humanity and I do feel that I've made some small contribution but I thank you for your kind words coming from a socialized medical system with all its faults one of its wonderful things is that we don't look to see what your insurance is when you come in everybody is hopefully treated with respect

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 并且有尊严和公平，这是我作为一名医生一直秉持的理念。嗯，我对此深感认同。嗯，我知道我的父母，嗯，在我父亲生病时，那时还没有社会化医疗。对他们来说非常困难，对我来说，维持这种高标准的护理极其重要。嗯，没有女性会被拒之门外。嗯，但我们需要更多的运营资金来运营这个中心，嗯，我们也需要更多的员工，因为需求量很大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: and dignity and equity and that is a philosophy that I've always had as a physician. Um, and I feel so strongly about it. Um, I know for my parents uh when my father got sick, there wasn't socialized medicine at that time. It was very difficult for them and I it's extremely important to me that we maintain that high standard of care. Um, that no woman is turned away. Um, but we need more operating dollars to run the center and um, we also need more staff because of the demand.

</details>

### 女性健康教育与展望

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您认为女性健康教育方面正在发生哪些变化和改进？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What changes, improvements are you seeing in how women's health is being taught?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我希望能说更多。这让我非常沮丧，因为我认为大学和医学院在这方面进展缓慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: I wish I could say more. That's very frustrating for me because I think the universities and the medical schools have been slow to catch on to this

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 所以我们一直在努力取得进展。我们举办讲座。就我个人而言，我在2005年左右为妇产科医生设立了一个临床研究员项目，我培训了大约25名妇产科临床研究员，他们分布在世界各地，为女性提供教学和护理，我认为我们在这方面做出了巨大贡献。当我们看家庭医生时，大约有20名家庭医生在我们中心轮岗，我们希望与家庭医生建立更紧密的联系，并鼓励他们成为这个领域的领导者。我们已经培训了一些我认为是未来领导者的人，以真正启动家庭医生内部的教育方面。我们努力在大学层面、住院医师层面进行倡导。所以我们已经尝试了，但我认为医学生需要学习的课程太多了，我们只占很小一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: and so we have tried to make inroads. We do lectures. We have for myself I started a clinical fellowship in in for obstitricians and gynecologists around 2005 and I've trained probably about 25 um clinical fellows in obstetrics and gynecology who are located all around the world and are teaching and providing care for women and in that way I think we've made a great contribution. When we look at family practice, we have about 20 family doctors rotate through our center and we're hoping to have a closer liaison with family practice and to encourage them as leaders in this area. We've trained some who I think are future leaders um to really initiate the educational aspects within family practice. Uh we've tried to advocate at the university level, at the residency level. So we've tried um but I think there's so much other curriculum that has to be provided for medical students that we get a very small portion.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，我很难让人们意识到，每个有卵巢的女性，只要活得足够长，都会经历**更年期**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um it's hard for me to make people realize that every woman who has ovaries who lives long enough will go through menopause.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 我总是说，这占人口的50%以上。然而，在研究这方面，教育投入却如此之少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: And I always say that that's over 50% of the population. and yet so little of this um educational part is given to studying that.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您认为需要做些什么来解决这种污名，以及女性健康是小众的这种观念？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What do you think needs to be done to address the stigma and also this idea that women's health is niche?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我认为思想必须改变，我可以就自己而言，在我有了孩子之后，我的职业生涯也在不断发展，正如我所说，这是一个过程。对我来说，我最大的贡献并非一蹴而就，而是在我**更年期**之后。我认为如果你看看加拿大各地，许多绝经后的女性正在为我们的社会做出巨大贡献。我认为我们应该为此得到认可。所以我想思想必须转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Well, I think that there has to be a change in thought and I can say for myself that after I had children and I'm sort of moving on in my career and and as I said it's a process. It wasn't all of a sudden for me that I made my biggest contribution after my menopause. And I think if you look around in Canada, many women who are post reproductive are making huge contributions to our society. And I think we should be recognized for that. And so I think there has to be a shift in thought.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 最大的变化是什么？今天女性健康方面最让您兴奋的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What has been the biggest change and what excites you today about women's health?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我想，我想我们刚才谈论的正是女性得到更多认可，关于**更年期**的污名减少了，在过去几年里，人们对它的认识更多了。就像**更年期**大爆发一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Well, I think I think exactly what we were talking about that women are being recognized more that there is less stigma about menopause that over the last few years there has been more recognition. There's like this menopause explosion

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 嗯，我认为这有好有坏，嗯，所以我想这是我看到的最大变化。个人而言，让我兴奋的是**衰老生理学**的发现，有一些关于衰老、**更年期**年龄及其遗传方面的数据。我发现这些机制对我来说是令人兴奋的部分，弄清楚为什么会发生这种情况，这意味着什么，嗯，我的意思是，我希望我能再活一百年，看到所有将要发生的变化和进步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: um and I think that has good parts and bad parts and um so I think that's the big change I've seen. What excites me personally is the discovery of physiology of um aging and there's some data about aging and age of menopause and genetic aspects to that. That's I find that like the mechanisms for me is the exciting part figuring out why and why is this happening and what does it mean and um I mean I wish I could live another hundred years to see all the changes and advances that are going to occur.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们在很大程度上依赖于来自美国的研究。嗯，**NIH**是1993年强制要求将女性纳入临床试验的机构，现在我们看到，嗯，美国女性健康研究缺乏资金。这是否是加拿大可能在这个领域迎头赶上的机会？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We've relied on a lot of studies from the United States. um the **NIH** was the one that mandated that women be included in clinical trials in 1993 and now we're seeing how um there's a lack of funding for women's health in the US. Is this an opportunity for Canada maybe to step up in that place?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 美国科学研究资金的缺乏或被削减让我非常担忧，因为我认为我们已经看到了基于此的许多巨大进步。嗯，是的，这是加拿大尝试吸引一些来自美国的人才并为他们提供研究机会的好机会。嗯，我们，**CIHR**，即**加拿大健康研究院**，在过去几年里设立了一些女性健康研究资金，比以前更多。嗯，所以现在加拿大为研究人员提供了竞争性拨款。嗯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: It worries me greatly that there is lack of funding or funding being removed in the US for scientific studies because I think we've seen so so many huge advances based on that. Um yes it is a big chance for Canada to try and take some of those people uh from the US and provide them with the opportunity to do research. Um we the **CIHR** the **Canadian Institute for Health Research** has instituted in the last few years um some women's health funding more than they had before. Um, and so there are competitive grants now in Canada being provided for researchers. Um,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但这仍然只占很小的比例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: but it's still a small percentage.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 是一个很小的比例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: It is a small percentage.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 就像6%或7%吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: like 6% or 7%?

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 是的。所以当你考虑到人口的50%时，这并不算多。嗯，但是是的，正在发生变化。事情正在向前发展。嗯，我想我们会成功的。我很乐观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: Yes. So it's not huge when you're looking at 50% of the population. Um, but yes, there is a change. Things are moving along. Um, and I think we'll get there. I'm optimistic.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 同感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Same.

</details>

**Dr. Wendy Wolfman**: 是的。
