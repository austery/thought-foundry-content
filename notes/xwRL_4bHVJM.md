### 特朗普的外交斡旋：乌克兰、以色列与委内瑞拉

在年末之际，美国总统特朗普举行了一系列引人注目的外交政策会议。首先，他接待了**乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基**，双方就结束乌克兰战争进行了会谈。泽连斯基总统表示，在讨论的20点和平方案上，双方取得了显著进展，并形容会谈“非常接近”达成共识。然而，俄罗斯官方对此类和平谈判持谨慎态度，并在周末对乌克兰首都发动了持续数小时的无人机和导弹袭击。

随后，特朗普总统在佛罗里达州的**马拉戈**（Mar-a-Lago）接待了**以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**。此次会晤正值美以关系在多个层面出现紧张之际。以色列在**黎巴嫩**和**叙利亚**的军事行动，似乎与特朗普政府稳定这些地区的外交努力相悖。同时，在**约旦河西岸**，内塔尼亚胡的右翼政治基础正推动其吞并该地区，尽管特朗普曾发出警告。此外，以色列在与**哈马斯**的停火期间继续在**加沙**地带发动袭击，此举似乎激怒了白宫。据巴勒斯坦官员称，自停火协议生效两个多月以来，以色列已造成超过400人死亡，其中包括150多名儿童，尽管以色列方面表示其目标仅限于武装分子。

在另一项外交政策更新中，特朗普总统在一次广播采访中透露，美国上周对**委内瑞拉**发动了一次新的打击行动，这可能是其针对该国不断升级的军事行动中首次已知的陆地攻击。据《纽约时报》接触的美国官员称，此次袭击目标是一个**毒品设施**，但他们拒绝透露具体细节，该地区当局也未公开报告相关袭击。特朗普数周来一直承诺对委内瑞拉采取行动，以加大对该国被其指控为“毒枭恐怖分子”的**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**政权的压力。

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, December 29th. Here's what we're covering. President Trump is closing out the year with a pair of high-profile foreign policy meetings at Mar-a-Lago. We discussed a lot of points and I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close. Yesterday, Trump hosted Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for talks about ending the war in Ukraine. There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues, but I think we're doing very well. We made a lot of progress today. The two were discussing a 20-point peace plan they've been hashing out. And Trump said he'd talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than two hours as well. Russian officials, however, have been downplaying any peace talks. And over the weekend, the country's military carried out an hourslong drone and missile assault on Ukraine's capital. Now, today in Florida, President Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The meeting comes as there have been growing tensions between the US and Israel on at least three fronts. The Israeli military's ongoing attacks in Lebanon and Syria seem to be at odds with the Trump administration's efforts to stabilize both of those countries. Also in the West Bank, Netanyahu's right-wing political base is pushing him to annex the territory despite warnings from Trump not to do that. And in Gaza, the fact that Israel has continued to carry out attacks there during the ceasefire with Hamas appears to have angered the White House. Since the truce went into effect more than 2 months ago, Palestinian officials say Israel has killed over 400 people, including more than 150 children. Israel says it has targeted only militants. Also, in one other foreign policy update, they have a big plant or a big facility where they send the, you know, where the ships come from. Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So, we we hit them very hard. President Trump said in a radio interview that the US carried out a new strike last week that may be the first known attack on land in his escalating military campaign against Venezuela. US officials the Times reached out to said Trump was referring to a drug facility, but declined to specify any details and there have been no public reports of an attack from authorities in the region. Trump has been promising strikes on Venezuela for weeks as he turns up the pressure on the country's authoritarian leader Nicholas Maduro, who he's accused of being a narco terrorist.

### 学生贷款新规：违约者面临工资扣押与破产新途径

从下周开始，**美国教育部**将开始通知部分拖欠学生贷款的借款人，政府将对其工资进行扣押。这意味着高达**15%的税后收入**可能会被扣留。这是在经历了数年的疫情期间学生贷款援助后，一种“回归常态”的做法。学生贷款还款在2020年至2023年期间完全暂停。即使在还款恢复后，违约的借款人也没有立即受到处罚。但在过去一年里，这些处罚措施已重新启动。首批被通知工资扣押的群体规模较小，约有**一千人**，预计每月人数将有所增加。目前总共有约**500万借款人**处于违约状态，预计还有数百万人可能面临错过还款。

与此同时，关于学生贷款长期以来的普遍认知是，即使在可以免除信用卡和医疗债务的**破产**程序中，也几乎无法摆脱学生贷款。尝试注销学生贷款需要提起单独的诉讼，并经历一个昂贵且不保证成功的法律过程。大多数人甚至不会尝试。然而，一项**拜登政府时期**的改革简化了这一流程，并为符合条件者提供了更清晰的指导。一项新的研究表明，借款人正在取得成功。他们仍然必须证明其学生贷款属于“**不当困境**”（undue hardship）——这是一个国会从未明确定义的法律标准，因此各法院的解释不一。但现在，通过这一流程的借款人，在驳回大部分或全部贷款方面，成功率达到了**87%**，这比二十年前的成功率翻了一番。该研究的一位研究员告诉《纽约时报》，考虑到“这几乎是不可能”的普遍说法，这一成功率“高得惊人”。

Starting next week, the Department of Education says it's going to notify some student loan borrowers who are in default that the government will garnish their wages. That could mean having up to 15% of their take-home pay withheld. It's a return to standard practice of sorts after years of pandemic era relief on student loans. Payments were paused entirely from 2020 to 2023. Even after the payments resumed, borrowers who defaulted weren't immediately penalized. But in the last year, those penalties have kicked back in. The first group to be notified about garnished wages will be small, roughly a thousand people. That number is expected to go up on a monthly basis. About 5 million borrowers are in default total and millions more are expected to be close to missing payments. Meanwhile, the longtime wisdom about student loans has been that there's no way to get out of them, even in bankruptcy, which can wipe away credit card and medical debt. Trying to erase student loans requires filing a separate lawsuit and undergoing a costly process with no guarantee of success. Most people don't even try. But a Biden era change streamlined the process and provided clearer guidelines on who could qualify. Now, a new study shows that borrowers are succeeding. They must still show that their student loans are in undue hardship, a legal standard that Congress never defined. So, courts across the country interpret it differently. But people who go through the process now have an 87% success rate in dismissing most or all of their loans, more than double the rate two decades ago. A researcher behind the study told the Times, quote, "That's strikingly high when you think about the narrative being, it's impossible."

### 严酷冬季天气席卷全美，交通出行受阻

与此同时，严酷的冬季天气正在全美范围内制造混乱，导致许多地区的旅行变得困难甚至不可能。**纽约**的**拉瓜迪亚机场**和**纽瓦克机场**出现了数百个航班被取消的情况。这座城市迎来了近四年来的最大降雪量，**中央公园**积雪超过4英寸，而该地区其他地方的降雪量则达到一英尺或更多。在中西部地区，气象预报员警告称，一场危险且可能危及生命的暴风雪正席卷该地区，带来了近乎“白茫茫一片”的路况。**明尼苏达州**部分州际公路因此被迫关闭，州警察敦促居民推迟或取消出行计划。总体而言，本周末全美有数万个航班延误，数千个航班被取消。

Across the country this weekend. We know this really could not have come at a worse time for those traveling for the holidays. Whether winter weather has been wreaking havoc as snow and winds have made travel difficult or impossible in many areas. You're taking a live look at LaGuardia and Newark airports. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in New York this weekend. The city got its heaviest snowfall in nearly four years. Central Park saw more than 4 inches pile up and other parts of the region got as much as a foot or more. Meanwhile, in the Midwest, we are under a next weather alert. Kind of obviously because it is messy out there. This doesn't forecasters are warning about a dangerous and potentially life-threatening storm that was set to bring blizzard conditions to the region through this morning. Images from the weather service show nearly white out conditions on roads in Minnesota, causing portions of the interstate there to be shut down. The state patrol told residents to push back or scrap travel plans for now. Overall this weekend, tens of thousands of flights were delayed and several thousand were cancelled.

### 2026年食品趋势预测：醋与“奶奶风”烹饪引领潮流

最后，展望食品界的未来。**IHOP**销售的蛋白质煎饼和2025年食品界“**峰值蛋白质**”的趋势预示着营养的关注。而放眼**2026年**，食品行业的研究人员、行业高管和餐厅老板们预测，**醋**可能成为当年的明星配料。厨师和调酒师正在将其广泛应用于各种场合，无论是用于腌制、调制无酒精饮品以增加风味，还是将百里香风味醋喷洒在温热的饼干上（这似乎是一种新奇的吃法）。另一个趋势是“**奶奶风**”（grandma core）烹饪，人们渴望回归传统手工食品，如自制泡菜以及小批量罐装和腌制的食品。2026年也可能围绕**口感**展开，继“脆”风靡一段时间后，食品行业内部人士认为“**嚼劲**”（Chewy）有望成为新的流行口感。此外，**芹菜**也可能开始出现在各种菜肴中，甚至包括甜点。

And finally, if you didn't know, IHOP sells protein pancakes. In 2025, the food world hit peak protein. Apparently, this matcha place is like the best in San Diego, but they always matcha was everywhere. like, "Oh man, look at all the lobster and shrimp." And classic chain restaurants like chili and Red Lobster proved they had staying power. Now, the Times is looking ahead to 2026 food trends. Checking in with market researchers, industry executives, restaurant owners, etc. to see what we'll be eating next year. They say the ingredient of 2026 may be vinegar. Chefs and bartenders are embracing it for all kinds of things. Whether it's pickling or mixing it into non-alcoholic drinks to give them more character or spritzing thymeflavored vinegar on warm cookies, which is apparently a thing. Another trend, grandma core cooking could be coming your way with people looking to tap into traditional home-crafted foods like sauerkraut and things jarred and canned in small batches. 2026 could also be all about texture. Crunchy has been all the rage for a while, but food insiders now think Chewy is on track to be the new crunchy. The full list of predictions is up at nytimes.com, including one that I'm truly trying to wrap my head around. Celery may start showing up everywhere, including in desserts.
