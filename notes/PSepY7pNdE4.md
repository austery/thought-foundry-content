title: Palantir 2025年第三季度财报：AI产品驱动的卓越增长与战略价值
---
### Palantir 2025年第三季度财报总结

这是Palantir 2025年第三季度财报的总结。整个团队，特别是**卡普博士**（Dr. Karp: Palantir的首席执行官），都充满了活力，他显然有一个信息要传达，而且我认为他成功地传达了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is the conclusion to Palunteer Q3 2025. You had a lot of energy coming in from the entire team especially with Dr. Karp and uh he obviously had a message to get across and I think he got it across.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 让我们从你开始，Amir，你对这次电话会议有什么看法？有人在聊天中写道，我想大家都注意到了，但有人写道，他数了卡普在开场演讲中正好敲了114次桌子。他坐在那里，使劲敲桌子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's start with you Amir your thoughts on the call. So, someone wrote in the chat like during I I I I think everyone uh know noticed this as well, but someone wrote uh I counted exactly 114 table banks throughout, you know, his opening speech. He was sitting and banging the the heck out of that table.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 嗯，我们之前就预料到了那个好问题。另一个训练营转换问题没有真正得到回答，但这不太重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Um uh well, we kind of predicted that nice question. Another boot camp conversion one uh wasn't really answered. Not not too important.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 我认为最重要的两点当然是了解**AFDs**（AI-powered Forward Deployed Engineers: 人工智能驱动的前线部署工程师，Palantir的AI产品，旨在大幅提升数据处理和问题解决效率）的进展。这已经是一个讨论了一段时间的话题了，有一些公开的演示和一些传闻，但现在他们开始给我们提供一些相关的具体数字，这是我非常喜欢的。我总是说，人们不总是理解Palantir是如何实施的，也不总是理解特定公司的用例，但每个人都理解时间。当他们说“在5天内生成一支AFDs大军来改造一个需要两年时间的传统数据仓库”时，每个人都能理解。两年缩短到五天，这非常显著。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the two the two biggest ones was of course to see okay what is happening with AFDs I mean it's it's been a topic for a while uh there have been some demos out out into the public some kind of you know there have been some some whisperings but you know they actually start to give us some kind of numbers like associated with it which is what what I love you know I always say this that people don't always understand you know where Palanteer is implemented they don't always understand the use cases at a specific company but everyone understands time when they say that uh you know uh spawning an army to uh you know of a fds to transform a legacy data warehouse in 5 days that would have taken two years like everyone can understand that two years to five days that is pretty significant.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 另外，还有**AI Hivemind**（AI蜂巢思维: Palantir的另一款AI产品，旨在聚合多个AFDs或类似智能体来协同解决复杂问题），这项新功能也很棒。总的来说，这个季度业务在每个细分市场都加速了，一切都在加速，甚至像你提到的欧洲等较弱的市场也由东南亚和韩国等市场带动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then also you know the the AI highmind the new capability there um great overall you know the quarter really the business accelerated on like throughout every single segment like everything accelerated even even the weak ones as you mentioned like Europe was carried by Southeast Asia you know and um you know Korea and those markets</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 我还想强调最后一个问题，它让我想起了**布伦特·蒂尔**（Brent Thiel）接受Jeff分析师采访的画面。他当时说：“打开传统电视，看看那些没有投资我们的人在哭泣。”如果你还记得布伦特·蒂尔的表情，他看起来快要哭了，坐在CNBC上，他看起来非常生气。那真是太神奇了。但我先让其他人分享他们的初步想法，然后再深入讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I also uh want to highlight um the last question there it just made me like picture Brent still just you know the the interview we we watched with the Jeff analyst just before when He said, um, uh, yeah, turn on conventional TV and watch those who didn't invest into us cry. And then, if you guys remember Brent Thiel's face, he kind of looked like he was about to cry. Like, he looked pretty pissed off, you know, just sitting there on CNBC. Uh, it was magical. Uh, but I I let someone else give their initial thoughts before we dive into deeper.</p>
</details>

### AI驱动的效率与增长潜力

**Arie:** Arie，请说出你的想法。最让我感兴趣的是看到AFDs的演变，现在**AI AFDs**（AI-powered Forward Deployed Engineers: 人工智能驱动的前线部署工程师）能够赋能FD（前线部署工程师）本身，以及他们的客户。这真正体现了“缩短时间”的理念，以至于我前几天还在思考。想象一下，你是一位家长，你的客户打电话给你，你如何能非常快速地展示你能做什么，你能解决什么问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Arie, go ahead. Your thoughts. The thing that intrigued me the most is um seeing the evolution of FDS, the AI FDs that now empower from what we understand the FD themselves and then the clients. That is uh what really talks the language of shrinking time to the point where I was really wondering the other day. Imagine you are a parent, you you are called by a client how you can really show what you can do, what you can tackle very fast.</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 基本上，他们用新产品**AI Hivemind**（AI蜂巢思维: Palantir的另一款AI产品，旨在聚合多个AFDs或类似智能体来协同解决复杂问题）来描述这一点，它是一个AFDs或其他类似智能体的聚合器，用于解决问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And essentially they described that with this new product AI hive mind which is an aggregator to of Aifds or similar agents to tackle problems.</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 我非常想了解更多关于这方面的信息，但如果它能将一个高技能FD两年的工作量在两天内完成，那看起来非常强大。这意味着你与客户的互动可以增加近100倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I would be very curious to learn more about this but seems so powerful if it is real that you can bring two years of work of a highly skilled FD in two days. It means that you can have almost 100x the interactions uh with your customers.</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 所以，对我来说，这似乎是整个电话会议中最强烈的暗示，因为它真正影响了公司的业绩。我们之前说过，如果你从一家普通公司的角度来看待这些数字，你可能会开始理性地认为这可能是一个高峰，然后情况会正常化。但如果你开始考虑AFDs的这些因素，并且管理层表示，我们之所以能在加速增长的同时获得高利润，正是因为AFDs，而且我们正在通过这款新产品看到AI AFDs的演变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this that to me seems the the strongest hint of the entire call because it's one of those stuff that really affect the numbers of the company. We were saying before if you look at it from the eyes of um normal company when you see numbers like this you can start rationally thinking oh this is probably a peak then stuff would normalize. But if you start including these considerations of what is Aifd and then the management says look the way we are accelerating while also getting a lot of margin is thanks to AFD and then we are seeing an evolution of A IFDs thanks to this new product.</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 这些都让我觉得，好吧，我们在数字上正处于一个高峰，但这个高峰并不是真正的“官方”高峰，因为有足够的实质内容支持这种趋势继续发展，也许不会总是60%的增长，但肯定会非常非常强劲。如果你能以如此强劲的速度增长，同时保持这些利润率，那么你的估值总是有基础的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What it these are the stuff that make me think okay we are at a peak in terms of numbers the peak is not the official peak like the there is enough substance for all this trend to keep rolling maybe it will not be always a 60% growth or so on but certainly it will be very very strong and if you can grow this strong while also having these margins it you always have ground for the evaluation.</p>
</details>

### Palantir的战略优势与市场地位

**Matt:** 好的，Matt，你对这次电话会议有什么看法？我认为这是一次非凡的电话会议。我的意思是，谁能在2020年或2021年想到，我们实际上会认为在2025年能达到大约45亿美元的收入？我的意思是，这简直是触手可及。然而我们做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Matt, your thoughts on the call? Well, I think it was a phenomenal call. Um, I mean, who would have expected back in 2020 2021 that we'd be actually thinking that we'd get to four and a half billion or so in in revenue um in 2025. I mean, that's just uh where we're literally within a an arms reach away. Um and yet here we are.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 我想当时每个人都在嘲笑，但这表明卡普真的很兴奋，而且我认为还有更多合同正在进行中。**沙姆**（Shyam Sankar: Palantir的首席运营官）显然正在四处奔波，参加各种会议，甚至去了白宫。我认为我们看到他与许多其他公司达成了这些协议。显然，他出现在白宫，并表示将承诺500亿美元的交易，而沙姆就坐在那里。显然，幕后有一个我们不了解的计划，我认为它尚未真正实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think everybody back then was laughing and um I think it just goes to show that um really Karp is excited and I think that there's even still more things to kind of come with with respect to a lot of contracts that are being worked on. Sham obviously is uh is out running about doing all the conferences uh going to the White House even. Um, I think we we've seen him, you know, making all these deals with a lot of these other companies. Uh, obviously showing up and saying they're going to pledge, you know, $50 billion deals to the White House and Seam sitting right there. Obviously, there's a plan um in the background that we're obviously not privy to that I think is yet to to truly come through.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 我认为其中很多都与**英伟达**（Nvidia）发生的事情有关。你开始看到这种合作关系出现。也许**Golden Dome**（Golden Dome: Palantir的一个重要政府项目，旨在整合和分析大量国防数据以支持决策和行动）项目不会实现。我仍然认为Palantir有很多机会可以进入，就像你之前说的，我们只有911个客户，而有成千上万的公司可以真正受益。我开始看到其他公司停滞不前，比如**Databricks**（Data Bricks: 一家数据和AI公司）和**Snowflake**（Snowflake: 一家云数据仓库公司）正在停滞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think a lot of that has to do with maybe what happened with Nvidia. You're starting to see that partnership come through. Maybe the Golden Dome stuff isn't going to come through. I still think there's just a lot of things with respect to opportunities that Palanteer has to enter and like you stated earlier, I mean, we're only at 911 total customers out of thousands upon thousands that uh can really benefit and I'm starting to see others really start to stall out like data bricks is really starting to stall out and several others. Um, Snowflake obviously we showed a great graphic with respect to revenue growth for them earlier.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 所以，我认为人们开始认识到，那些被认为是伟大技术、伟大软件或伟大服务，人们曾寄予厚望能彻底改变其业务的产品，并没有像预期那样出现，很可能只是在浪费钱，但Palantir的软件能带来好结果。而且我认为我们还没有完全看到，他们提到了AI AFDs尚未完全推出，以及其他一些关键产品也尚未完全推出，但可能处于试用模式。我非常好奇，当这些产品正式推出并真正推动利润增长时，我们能期待客户数量持续增长到什么程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think people really starting to recognize that what people said was a great technology and great software or great service that people were really hoping to to really revolutionize their business isn't showing up as once expected and is likely just throwing good money after bad, but you get good results with with Palunteer software. And I don't think that we've fully seen they stated something huge in there uh with respect to to AIFT not necessarily being fully rolled out as of yet and and and some other uh key uh products that I don't think are fully rolled out as of yet but are probably in the trial mode. I'm very curious to see when those are officially rolled out and actually start to drive the bottom line what we can expect in terms of continued customer account growth.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 这可能不一定意味着营收增长会持续保持在60%、70%或80%。但你不需要太多。我的意思是，你只需要从**净美元留存率**（Net Dollar Retention: 衡量现有客户在特定时期内产生的收入增长百分比，包括升级、降级和流失）的角度持续实现营收增长，这为你的同比营收增长提供了一个良好的基础。所以我非常好奇最终会发生什么，是的，这会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it might not necessarily mean that you know revenue growth continues in the 60 70 80%. But you don't need much. I mean all you need is continued revenue growth from a uh a net dollar retention perspective and and that kind of provides a good floor for what your year-over-year revenue growth would be. So very curious to see what ends up happening and um yeah it's uh yeah it's going to be interesting.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 我还认为有一些关于现有客户的有趣评论。他们提到，在前911个客户中，前20个客户贡献了43%的收入，而且他们的增长速度正在加快。这前20个客户几乎占据了业务的一半，现在他们同比增长38%，高于净美元留存率。所以，那些最忠诚、价值最高的客户的增长速度高于整体净美元留存率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I also think there were some uh interesting comments regarding like uh the the current customers. So they mentioned that the top 20 customers uh I I did the calculations uh still 20 out of 911 customers account for 43% of revenues and they are accelerating like how much they're growing 20 like the top 20 customers account for almost half the business and they are now growing uh 38% year-over-year which is higher than the net dollar retention. So the most sticky like most like revenue highest value clients are growing higher than like uh uh the overall net dollar retention.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 然后在电话会议中提出了一个问题：“你们是如何实现这种规模增长的？”我不记得确切的引述，但大意是：“我们拥有AI市场中关注价值创造的那部分。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the question came up in in in the call like well h how are you able to scale like this and uh there there was a I don't remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of we own part of the AI market that cares about value creation.</p>
</details>

### 专注于价值创造的AI市场主导者

**Amir:** 是的，因为现在人们过度关注谁能投入最多的资本支出，谁能购买最多的GPU，谁能构建下一个大型语言模型（LLM）。但他（卡普）说：“不，我们拥有AI市场中关注价值创造的整个部分。”这非常强大，因为他还提到：“我们只是创造价值，然后获得一部分报酬。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. because there is so much hyperfocus on who can build out the most capex uh who can uh you know buy the most GPUs, who can you know uh build the next LM but he he put it like yeah no we own the whole part of the AI market that cares about value creation and that is like really powerful because he also mentioned we simply we create the value and then we get paid. a portion of that which is like how I always envision in my head like well how can Palunteer grow to like one trillion two trillion dollar market cap well when you are able to sell your product for basically any price as long as you're providing value like that that that is uh in in aggregate of that.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 这正是我一直设想的：Palantir如何能增长到万亿甚至两万亿美元的市值？当你能够以几乎任何价格销售你的产品，只要你提供价值，那就会实现。假设你为一家企业创造了1000亿美元的价值，每年向该客户收取超过10亿美元的费用并不奇怪，这只是举例用的虚构数字。如果你能创造更多价值，你就可以收取更多费用，这不是固定价格。所以，我认为这种动态对Palantir来说非常强大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's say that you you create a hundred billion dollars of value for a business. It is not like too weird to charge over a billion from that customer annually like just some you know bogus numbers to put an example. If you can create more value you can you can charge them more like it's not a fixed price. So I think um that dynamic is really really powerful for Palunteer.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 他还提到，现在当人们联系我们时，他们抱有比最初客户更高的期望。他们会说：“让我的业务变得出色。”这就是他们所说的，然后Palantir就会介入，说：“我们会这样解决你的业务问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he he also mentioned that like yeah we're kind of known now when people contact us and get in touch with us they have higher expectations than customers have had initially. They're like okay make my business amazing. That's like what what they say and then it's up to Palunteer to come in and be like okay this is how you're going to fix your business.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 想象一下，他还谈到了一些动态，比如不必将公司私有化等等，但本质上，如果你的公司开始失败，或者你的竞争对手做得比你好，你就会说：“嘿，Palantir，来帮我们解决这个问题。”想象一下这样的场景，这对我来说简直是不可思议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like imagine that he he also like talked about some dynamics about you know without having to go take your company private whatever but essentially you have your company you're you're kind of starting to fail or your competitors doing better than you you're like hey Palanteer come fix this for us like imagine a scenario like that it's just completely crazy to me</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 考虑到三年前的情况是多么不同，那时我们看到卡普敲桌子不是因为高兴，而是因为他知道“你们需要这些东西才能生存”。我们知道未来你们会更需要**本体论**（Ontology: 在信息科学中，指对特定领域概念及它们之间关系的正式表示）和**Foundry**（Foundry: Palantir的数据集成和操作系统平台）。这还是在AI出现之前，而现在我们已经到了客户主动联系他们，说“我们不只对一个用例感兴趣，我们想基于AI重建整个公司”的地步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">consider how different it was uh three years ago when we saw Karp banging on the table but not because he was happy but because uh it was we know you need this stuff to survive. We know that in the future you will need this stuff ontology in Fundry even more and this was before AI and now we are at the point where customers reach them we are not interested in a use case we want to rebuild the entire company based on AI</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 我特别欣赏的是Palantir的可靠性，你可以根据结果来制定你想要的财务指标。看看Palantir的数字，它们非常完美。所以他们所做的确实有效，而且现在每个行业都有顶尖客户引领潮流。卡普说，客户现在联系我们，因为他们看到其他使用我们产品的公司做了什么，他们意识到其他替代方案很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh stuff that I particularly appreciate is how credible Palunteer is that you can craft the financial metrics you want uh based on results. Look at Palanteer numbers they are perfect. So what they do actually works and you have the top clients in each industry now that leads the way and Karp says okay the customers now reach reach us because they look potential customers are they they reach us because they look what other companies using us do and they realize okay the alternatives suck.</p>
</details>

### 卓越的财务表现与宏观趋势洞察

**Amit Kukreja:** 是的，我同意。我基本上同意你们所说的一切。我认为卡普在电话会议中非常兴奋，我认为他兴奋的原因与股票无关。坦率地说，这与这个季度令人难以置信的事实有关，而股票会做它该做的事情。我的意思是，它的股价再次达到202美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I agree. I I I pretty much agree with everything you guys said. I thought Karp was very excited on the call and uh I think the reason he was excited was has nothing to do with the stock. Quite frankly, it had to do with the fact that this quarter was incredible and the stock will do whatever the stock does. I mean, again, it's at 202.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我们很多人在它低于10美元的时候就关注这个名字。所以，对于那些抱怨“哦，它没有达到220美元”的人，很难抱有太多同情。如果你的分析仅限于此，那没关系。但如果你真的持有这家公司未来10年，并且你关注的不是股票回报（这已经远远超过了整个市场的大多数股票），而是他们发布的业绩，我的意思是，我也会像卡普一样充满活力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of us were covering this name below was $10. So, it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for the oh, it's not at 220. It's like, okay, that's fine. If that's the extent of your analysis, then then you can have that. But if you're actually holding this company for the next 10 years and you're looking at not the returns of the stock, which have been far beyond most stocks in the entire market, but actually looking at the results they put out, I mean, I would be as energetic as Karp as well.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 如果你拿出14%的**40法则**（Rule of 40s: SaaS公司衡量增长和盈利能力平衡的指标，指增长率和利润率之和应大于40%），77%的美国商业增长，零债务，65亿美元现金，以及63%的营收增长，我的意思是，这些数字简直令人难以置信。很难批评这些数字。只是，你知道，股票估值中已经包含了太多预期。所以，你可能不会仅仅基于这些数字就看到爆炸性的上涨，但这些数字确实令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're pulling up 14% rule of 40s, 77% US commercial growth, no debt, 6 and a half billion in cash, uh, and topline revenue growth of 63%. I mean, these numbers are just incredible. It's hard to critique the numbers. It's just, you know, the stock has a lot baked into the valuation already. So, you might not get an explosive move based on based on just these numbers, but the numbers are incredible.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 所以，我认为卡普在电话会议中说的最重要的一点是，围绕着“战士”和美国存在一种哲学上的宏观趋势。他提出的最后一点我完全同意，那就是这个想法：如果6万名耶鲁大学毕业生因为芬太尼而死亡，美国会采取行动。所以，当美国的精英阶层开始受苦时，美国才会开始关注。但当那些朝九晚五、靠工资过活的普通男女受苦时，没有人关心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I I think the biggest thing that Karp said in that call was that there is a philosophical macro trend around the war fighter and America. The last point he made I can't agree with even more, which is this idea of, you know, if 60,000 Yale graduates were dying because of fentinol, the United States would do something about it. So when you have the elite of the United States, we talked about this bifurcated economy, the elite of the United States, when they start suffering, that's when the United States starts to pay attention. But when you have average men and women that are working uh 9 to5, living paycheck to paycheck, when they're suffering, no one cares.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我认为，如果你押注Palantir，你就是押注一家正在构建软件的公司，它不是为了取代这些人，而是为了赋能这些人。我认为这是卡普想要传达的一个非常重要的观点，告诉人们你们投资的是谁，为什么要投资这家公司，以及分析师们在试图分析这家公司时从未完全理解的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think if you are betting on pound, you're betting on a company that's building software, not to replace those people, but to actually empower those people. And I think that's a really important point that Karp wanted to get through, telling people this is who you're investing in. this is why you're investing in the company and this is what the analysts, you know, have never fully understood as they've been trying to analyze this company.</p>
</details>

### 军事整合与未来展望

**Amit Kukreja:** 就这样，这就是我们对财报的看法。再说一次，股票会做它该做的事情。归根结底，这是一个非凡的季度。卡普、沙姆和团队在电话会议中充满了活力，他们拿出的数字也完全证明了这种活力是合理的。我们明天会回来。我今晚晚些时候9:30还会回来，我正在做另一个播客。所以我会直播，我们会就科技界正在发生的事情进行更多讨论。我想我们可能在本周五会有一个Palantir周报来回顾这些数字。如果没有，那么我们最终会安排一个会议，大家深入探讨这些数字。我敢肯定我们会把它们放到我们的Excel表格中，但这就是我们所掌握的。Arie，还有什么最后的话吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there you go. That's what we got on earnings. Again, the stock will do whatever the stock does. At the end of the day, this was an exceptional quarter. Lots of energy from Karp, Sham, and the team on that call. Uh, and they put up the numbers that quite frankly justify having that type of energy. Uh, we'll be back tomorrow. I'll be back later tonight at 9:30. I'm doing another podcast. So, I'll be live and we'll uh do some more discussions on what's going on in the world of tech. I think we might have a palenture weekly this Friday to recap the numbers. If we don't, then you know, we'll we'll eventually schedule a session where we all go deeper into the numbers. I'm sure we'll put them in our Excel sheets, but that's what we got. Any last words, Arie?</p>
</details>

**Arie:** 简直太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just wow.</p>
</details>

**Amir:** 是的，太棒了。我只想强调最后一个有点被忽视的引述，那就是他们提到军方已决定将所有系统整合到**Vantage**（Vantage: Palantir为军事和政府客户提供的集成数据和决策平台）上，这基本上意味着军队正在开始整合自身，并开始在Palantir上完成所有工作，并将取代并淘汰所有传统系统。所以对于我们这些对Palantir政府方面，也就是**GoARP**（GoARP: Palantir的政府业务，专注于国防和情报领域）和相关领域充满热情的人来说，这也是一个非常棒的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, amazing. I I just wanted to highlight one one last quote that went under the radar a bit and that is that they mentioned that the military has taken decision to consolidate everything onto Vantage which basically means that the arm is like starting to align themselves and start to do everything on Palunteer and will replace and kill all the legacy systems. So for we we have some enthusiasts about you know um Palanteer government side you know goarp and and that game. So that's fantastic news as well.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我的印象是，或者从沙姆的评论来看，他说有很多事情他不能谈论，我们可以假设沙姆正在从事一些非常大的项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Was my impression or from the comments Sham did in saying there are a lot of stuff we I can't talk home talk about we can assume okay Sham is working on into some very big projects.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 我也是这个印象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the impression I got.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我同意。是的，我认为**Golden Dome**（Golden Dome: Palantir的一个重要政府项目，旨在整合和分析大量国防数据以支持决策和行动）将是一个非常被低估的重要项目，我认为人们并没有真正关注它，而且我认为仅此一项就能为Palantir带来数十亿美元的收入。我认为除了Palantir，没有其他人适合处理这样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I agree. Yeah, I think I think Golden Dome is going to be a big piece that is very undervalued that I don't think people are really paying attention to and I think that that will be billions of revenue alone for Palunteer if um and I don't think there's anybody else out there suited uh that that could handle something like that other than Palunteer.</p>

**Amit Kukreja:** 所以我确信，在**特朗普**（Donald Trump）任期结束前，如果该项目通过，将有数千亿美元的资金需要支出，其中很大一部分将流向Palantir。这不仅仅是一家公司能独享的权利。我的意思是，我们谈论的是众多公司需要相互合作才能使其成功。

<p class="english-text">Um, so I'm sure obviously a large that's we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars that has to be spent by before the end of Trump's term if that goes through and a large portion of that would go to Palunteer. It's not just one company that's going to get that right. I mean, we're talking a multitude of companies that are going to have to partner with each other to be able to to make that successful.</p>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我最后要说的是，嘿，短期内股价可能会下跌。而且，你知道，即使有了这些新数字，它的估值仍然很高。如果你将这些数字年度化到未来四个季度，不包括任何实际增长，你仍然在谈论200到300倍的**市盈率**（PE: Price-to-Earnings Ratio，衡量公司股价相对于每股收益的倍数）。

<p class="english-text">And last piece I'll say is, hey, the stock might drop, you know, in the short term. And I, you know, it's it is richly valued even with these new numbers. you're still talking about a PE between 200 and 300x if you kind of annualize out these numbers out for the next four quarters, not including any real growth.</p>

**Amit Kukreja:** 但我想说的是，仅仅基于我们所看到的以及利润率的持续增长，在十年内，我们谈论的是一家将继续占据主导地位的公司，很可能成为我们拥有的最重要的企业公司。显然，这在我的价值观中扮演着重要角色，那就是支持西方并帮助维护自由。所以，我认为对我来说，这是一个无需思考的决定。我每次拿到工资都会继续加仓。

<p class="english-text">But what I will say is is just based off what we're seeing and the continued increase in margins in 10 years time. I mean, we're talking about a company that will continue to to be dominant and will likely be the most important enterprise company that uh that we have. And obviously it it plays a hu huge part in my values, which is supporting the West and and helping Silver Liberty. So I think uh to me it's a no-brainer. Um I'm going to continue to add uh every time I get a paycheck.</p>
