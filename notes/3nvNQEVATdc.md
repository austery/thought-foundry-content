title: 挪威主权财富基金的沟通策略转型：从封闭到开放
---
### 沟通策略的演变：从封闭到开放

非常高兴今天能看到这么多人在清晨聚集于此。今天，我们挪威主权财富基金（**Oljefondet**：挪威政府为未来世代设立的全球最大主权财富基金）的沟通团队将带领大家回顾我们走过的这段旅程。五年前，我们还是一家封闭且傲慢的机构。如今，我们变得开放，并且我希望也变得不那么傲慢了。今天大家将听到的是关于这段旅程的讲述。我还没有看到具体议程，因为他们说这是秘密文件，尽管我们对许多事情都持开放态度，但我本人却看不到议程。

<p class="english-text">Eh, so incredibly nice to see so many people early in the morning. And eh, what we will do today, or what our great communication team will do today, is to take you through the journey we have been on in the Oil Fund. Five years ago, we were closed and arrogant. Now we are open and I hope less arrogant and what they will hear today is to take you through that journey. I haven't seen the program because they say it's secret stamped and we are open about many things, but I don't get to see the program. Ehm, but it's like I think about communication, you are actually the most important in the company. Because without you, you can't get anything done at all.</p>
</details>

### 核心挑战与系统性改进

当我最初与这里的140名员工坐下来，谈论大家遇到的困难时，我们很明确地确定了需要解决的三个方面。首先是绩效，这是我们必须持续关注的。其次是人员，因为他们有些被忽视了。最后是沟通，因为沟通太少了。然后，Marte和她的团队系统性地分解了这些问题，并致力于改进所有环节。在我看来，这可以简单地分为两部分：内部沟通至关重要。因为没有内部沟通，我们就无法实现基金内部的文化变革。我们拥有了全新的沟通平台，沟通的体量和内容类型都有了显著提升。这不仅仅是事实内容的传递，更是文化内容的传播，它正在改变我们的态度和做事方式。同时，作为一家全球性组织，我们必须以不同的方式与海外分支机构建立联系，因为过去他们感到有些孤立，但现在他们与我们的联系更加紧密了。我想在座的许多人也有类似的挑战。

<p class="english-text">And eh, when I came and sat down with 140 employees here in the beginning and talked about where the shoe pinched, it was quite obvious that we landed on three things that we should fix. One was performance, because we have to do that. Then it was the people because they were a bit neglected. And then it was communication because it was there was too little communication. And then Marte and the team have actually eh broken this up systematically and worked on improving all parts. And as I see it, simply put, internal communication is super important. Because without internal communication, we wouldn't have achieved the cultural change we have made in the fund. We have completely different platforms to communicate on. We have a completely different volume. We have a completely different type of content. And it's not just factual content, but it's cultural content that is changing attitudes eh and the way we do things. And then it's important for us as a global organization to connect with the overseas offices in a different way because they felt a bit lonely out there in the old days, but now they are much more closely connected to us. And many of you have the same problem.</p>
</details>

### 内部与外部沟通的转型

外部沟通方面，五年前，挪威主权财富基金只有四个人被允许公开谈论基金。仅仅四个人。今年到目前为止，已有超过100人就基金的对外事务进行过发言，无论是对媒体还是在各种演讲中。这自然会带来一种自豪感，让那些进行陈述的人感到骄傲，同时也大大增强了信任度，因为人们能够直接与真正了解情况的人交流。这真是一段非凡的旅程。他们还做了许多其他事情，之后会详细介绍。但这一切都促成了我们现在成为世界上最开放的基金。这并非空谈，因为实际上存在一个关于开放性的世界锦标赛，我们已经连续三年夺冠。对此我们非常满意。现在我们已经赢得了如此多次，以至于他们决定取消这项世界赛事。这意味着，我们永远是世界冠军。

<details>

<p class="english-text">External communication. Five years ago, there were four people in the oil fund who were allowed to speak publicly about the oil fund. Four people. So far this year, over 100 people have spoken about the oil fund externally to the media or in various presentations. And that naturally creates pride among those who present and it creates much better trust when people out there actually get to meet those who know what they are talking about. So it has been a huge journey. And then they have done a lot of other things that they will talk about later. But it has led to us now being the world's most open fund. And it's not just something we say, because there is actually a world championship in openness. And we have now won it three years in a row. And we are very pleased with that. And now we have won it so many times that they have decided to cancel the world championship. Eh, and that means that we are world champions forever.</p>
</details>

### 透明度成就与全球认可

我曾认为开放性是好的，因为它能让外部人士了解我们的工作，从而对我们产生更多信任。但现在我明白了，开放性是双向的。我们对外部世界的开放，也使我们能够以全新的方式吸收组织外部发生的事情。我们能够更好地交流学习经验。我认为这是我们如今在人工智能领域处于领先地位的原因，因为我们对自己的工作保持开放，人们也愿意与我们分享。当然，这也是我们今天邀请大家前来的原因，我们希望与你们谈论沟通，但我们也能从你们那里学到很多东西，所以我们相信这将是极其充实的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ehm, but what I thought about openness was that openness is good, because then outsiders can see what we are doing and gain more trust in what we are doing. But what I have understood is that openness goes both ways. And that by being open to the outside world, we also absorb things that happen outside the organization in a completely different way. We eh have much better exchange of eh learning. I think that's the reason why we are now leading in artificial intelligence because we have been open about everything we do and then people will share with us. And that is of course why we have invited all of you as well because we want to talk about communication with you, but we have a lot to learn from you too, so therefore we think this will be a super day.</p>
</details>

### 基金的角色与战略背景

所以，可以说，现在是为基金工作令人兴奋的时期，这是我们需要关注的一切。这一切构成了我们当前制定战略的背景。今天，大家将能一窥我们今天中午12点发布的战略。我们需要努力的方向是制定一个能够让我们在充满动荡的时代保持清晰、相关和值得信赖的战略。正如大家在这张图片中看到的，即使曼哈顿的阳光灿烂，我们也为“雨天”做好了准备。Nikolai当时对这张阳光下的照片感到有些不自在。我还有许多才华横溢的同事将发表演讲。让我特别提到图片中的Line，她是沟通部主管，今天她不会发言。但没有她，我们肯定无法度过这些动荡的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is, to say the least, an exciting time to work in the fund and this is all that we have to keep track of. And for us, this forms the backdrop for the strategy eh that we are now laying down. And today you will get a little sneak peek at the strategy that we are presenting at 12 o'clock today. And what we have to work on is to achieve a strategy that makes us clear, relevant, and trust-building in a time characterized by much unrest. And as you see in this picture, we are prepared for a rainy day even when the sun shines on Manhattan. Nikolai was a bit uncomfortable taking this picture in the sun.</p>

### 挪威主权财富基金概览

但在我们开始谈论沟通之前，大家需要了解一点关于基金的信息。我猜想大家都有一定的了解，但这是世界上最大的主权基金。我们持有全球超过8000家公司的少量股份。你想到一个公司，我们很可能就持有它的股份。我们覆盖了挪威国家预算超过25%的支出。挪威国家成本的25%以上是由这个基金覆盖的。近年来，这一数字大幅增长。因此，我们所做的贡献极其重要，而在挪威，与我们周围所有其他国家相比，我们处于极其有利的地位。而且，是你们拥有它。现在已经有370万挪威人拥有它。这210000亿挪威克朗的资产管理规模，是由1996年最初投入的20亿挪威克朗发展而来的。它的规模之大，几乎难以想象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And with me, I have many talented colleagues who will be speaking. Let me mention Line in the picture and Head of Communications who will not speak today. Because without her, we would not have managed this through turbulent times. But before we sort of get started talking about communication, you need to know a little bit about the fund. So I reckon in a way that there is knowledge here, but it is the world's largest state fund. So we own a small piece of over 8,000 companies globally. And if you think of a company, we most likely own it. And then we cover more than 25% of the state budget. So more than 25% of the costs of the Norwegian state are covered by this fund. And it has increased enormously over the last few years. So our contribution is enormously important and we are in Norway in an extremely lucky position compared to all other countries around us. And then it is you who own it. 3.7 million per Norwegian it has become now. 21,000 billion under management these first two billion that were put in in 1996 have become. And it is so large that one can hardly imagine it.</p>
</details>

### 治理模式：政治架构与委托管理

几周前我在瑞典时，当我在世界各地介绍这些数字时，他们会嘲笑这些金额，因为实在太大了。我们非常、非常幸运。在很多方面，挪威已经两次发现了石油，因为我们有这些投入基金的资金，大约50000亿挪威克朗。但我们还投资于股票市场、债券、房地产，现在还包括未上市基础设施。在很多方面，我们又一次发现了石油，因为回报如此之高。所以，这是关于基金是什么的简要介绍。了解这些很重要，因为这是我们的治理模式，它有点复杂，但我会尽量简单地解释。这是一个政治构建，了解这一点很重要。一些有能力的政治家提出了为子孙后代储蓄的理念。所以我们应该储蓄，而不是一次性花光所有钱，导致经济失控。因此，是**Stortinget**（挪威议会：挪威的最高立法机构）赋予了**Finansdepartementet**（挪威财政部：负责制定国家财政政策和管理国家资产的政府部门）制定 mandato（委托）的任务。**Finansdepartementet**是基金的所有者。之后，这项任务被委托给了**Norges Bank**（挪威央行），并成立了**Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM)**（挪威央行投资管理公司：负责管理挪威主权财富基金的机构）。这就是我们，我们负责管理这个基金。但是，所有重大的战略变革、所有重大的配置决策，都是由我们的政治家决定的。这一点非常重要，因为它也意味着他们决定了挪威人民的风险承受能力。我们70%的投资是股票，这意味着我们有很高的风险承受能力。我们必须为大量的波动做好准备。这也就意味着，我们必须以与投资于国债的基金截然不同的方式进行沟通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when I present this around the world, I was in Sweden a few weeks ago, they laugh at the sums, don't they, because it's so big. We are so eh eh privileged. Eh, and in many ways, we in Norway have found oil twice because we have these funds that have been put into the fund, which is around 5,000 billion. But then we have invested out in the stock markets, in bonds, in real estate, and now also unlisted infrastructure. And then we have in many ways found oil once again because the return is so high. So that was a very brief overview of what the fund is. And then eh it's okay that you know exactly this, because this is our governance model, which is a bit complex, but I will explain it eh very simply. And that is that this is a political construct and it's okay to know that. There are some capable politicians who came up with the idea that we should save money for future generations. So we should save, not spend all the money at once and get a kind of runaway economy. So it is the Stortinget that has then given the Ministry of Finance the task eh of creating a mandate. And it is the Ministry of Finance that is the owner of the fund. And thereafter, this task has been delegated to Norges Bank, which has then established Norges Bank Investment Management. And that is us, we manage this fund. But all major strategic changes, all major allocation decisions, are determined by our politicians. And it is very important to know, because it also means that they have determined the risk tolerance that the Norwegian people have. And the fact that we are 70% invested in stocks means that we have a large risk tolerance. Here we must be prepared for a lot of fluctuations. And that implies that we must communicate in a completely different way than if this were a fund that was much more invested in eh government bonds.</p>
</details>

### 关键风险：地缘政治与声誉

因此，我们有一个巨大的风险图景需要关注。我们需要有良好的系统，需要分析这些风险，并需要管理风险。但更重要的是，我们必须围绕这些风险进行非常好的沟通。我将谈论其中的两个方面。这张幻灯片显示了气候风险和技术发展。例如，AI股票的集中度，整个科技行业的影响力。然后是地缘政治风险和声誉风险，我将重点谈谈这两者。我们先从地缘政治开始。在开头的介绍视频中，大家已经看到了世界各地正在发生多少事情。我们的任务是通过不断变化的市场环境来保护这个基金。地缘政治风险的突出性日益增加，我在这方面花费的时间现在明显增多。几年前，这几乎是无人考虑的。我常说，当你投资于70多个市场的8000多家公司时，世界上总会有某个地方出问题。是的，我们很可能在那里有投资，即使不是在那个地区，也可能是在某个出问题的公司里。我们必须清楚这一点。所以，这张幻灯片展示的是我们目前特别关注的六个地缘政治情景。它们主要与大国冲突和广泛制裁有关。我只举几个例子。中国的投资可行性：这实际上是由于美国或欧洲等方面的投资限制，导致投资中国公司变得困难的风险。中间是我们熟知的俄罗斯、乌克兰、中东的战争。哈雷情景：不是说发生的可能性很大，但如果发生，将对基金产生重大影响。这里的场景是中东地区发生区域性战争，影响能源供应。俄罗斯-乌克兰战争是两国之间的事情。然后当然是中国，我们密切关注。台湾是一个大家熟知的地区。但再次强调，这是一个情景，意味着可能不仅仅是创新，而是该地区发生更大规模的战争。情况可能变得非常糟糕。这不一定是高概率情景，但如果发生，将对基金产生重大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have a large risk picture that we must eh keep track of. And we must have good systems. We must analyze this eh and we must manage the risk. But not least, we must communicate very well around it. And I will talk about two of them. On this slide you see yes, it is climate risk, it is technological development. It is, after all, the entire concentration of power. How much these AI stocks, how much the entire technology sector eh has to say. Then there is geopolitical risk and reputational risk, which I will talk a little about. So we start with geopolitics. And you saw that very clearly in this introductory video how much is happening eh around the world. And our task is to protect this fund through changing market conditions. And geopolitical risk has become increasingly prominent and the time I spend on this is now considerably more. It was not something one hardly thought about a few years ago. And I usually say that when you are invested in over 8,000 companies in over 70 markets, something goes wrong somewhere in the world. Yes, we are probably invested, if not in the area, then perhaps also in a company where it goes eh wrong. And one must be aware of that. So what you see on this slide here is simply six of the geopolitical scenarios we are following particularly closely now. And they are mainly related to great power wars and extensive eh sanctions.</p>
</details>

### 透明度实践与荣誉

我们所做的是发布所谓的“情景分析”。我们几年前就开始了这项工作，是在一份备受关注的报告，名为《斯瓦尔德鲁特报告》（**Sverdrutrapporten**：一份关于地缘政治对挪威主权财富基金影响的报告）之后开始的，该报告特别关注基金周围的地缘政治影响以及基金将如何进一步发展。我们开始就此进行大量沟通。我们今年提出的分析显示了三种情景。其中一种情景是，在更广泛的债务危机中，基金可能下跌40%。为什么这对我们来说如此重要，要围绕这一点进行沟通？这是为了管理预期，无论是对政治家还是对挪威民众，让他们了解基金可能受到的影响，以及他们可能面临的情况。而且，如果基金大幅下跌，我们是少数能够购买的机构之一。届时，我们周围的所有其他人都将下跌。这将是一个全球性情景，而我们是少数能够购买的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I shall just take a couple of examples. We are China Investibility. That is, of course, eh the risk that it becomes difficult to invest in Chinese companies due to investment restrictions from, for example, the USA or Europe. In the middle, we have wars you are well acquainted with, both in Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East. Harley scenario, isn't it? That the scenario, and then it's not a big chance that it will happen, but if it happens, it will have a major impact on the fund. It has the scenario here is, of course, a more regional war in the Middle East that affects energy supply. Russia-Ukraine is a war that affects that country. And then of course we have China, which one follows closely. Taiwan is an area eh you are familiar with. But once again a scenario, and there it is that it doesn't just become an innovation, but a larger war in that region. It's dark enough once again. This is not necessarily a high-probability scenario, but if it happens, it will affect this fund a lot. So what we do is publish so-called scenario analyses. We started eh with that a few years ago, but it was after eh a much-discussed report called the Sverdrutrapporten, which looks at geopolitical influence around the fund specifically and how the fund will develop further. we started communicating eh a lot eh around eh this eh and the eh the analyses we presented eh this year, they show three scenarios. And one of these scenarios is a fall of 40% in the fund with a more comprehensive debt crisis. And why is it so important for us to eh communicate around eh this? It is for expectation management, both of politicians and the Norwegian people about how much it can affect the fund the day one eventually eh stands there. And then it is actually the case that if the fund falls a lot eh then we are one of the few. Then everyone else around us will fall. Then it's a global scenario. Then we are one of the few who can buy.</p>
</details>

### 新战略：成为全球领先的投资管理机构

转向声誉风险。我展示了一张路标图，也可以展示一个人劈叉的图。我有时感觉就像那样。这涉及到满足各种期望。而今年秋天，我们才真正看到，我们对挪威的期望以及我们对国际的期望之间存在着日益扩大的差距。我也观察到，国际原则的一致性，我们赖以平衡我们如何投资的原则，也不再像以前那样普遍存在。这对我们沟通意味着什么？当然，这意味着我们不能再用完全相同的方式沟通。我们必须适应，但必须对其中的挑战保持非常开放的态度。我们将在下一个战略时期内这样做。我们还必须以最好的方式应对这种“劈叉”局面。我们认为，许多解决方案在于良好的沟通和知识建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Over to reputational risk. I show a road sign. I could have shown a person in a split. I sometimes feel like that. It's about meeting various expectations. And this autumn, we have really seen that the expectations of us in Norway and the expectations of us internationally, there is a growing gap. And I also observe that the consensus around international principles, which we balance how we are invested on, is also not necessarily present in the same way as before. And what does that mean for us eh when we communicate? And of course, it means eh that we we cannot necessarily communicate in completely different ways. We must adapt, but we must be very open about the challenges that lie in that. And we will do that in the next eh strategic period. And then we must also manage to stand in that split in the best possible way every single day. And then yes, we believe that a lot of the solutions lie in good eh communication and knowledge building.</p>
</details>

### 战略目标一：深耕挪威市场，建立信任

近年来，我们进一步提高了开放度。Nikolai提到了那个我实际上要介绍的世界冠军。这是SEM Benchmarking公司几年前创建的全球透明度基准。当年我们没有获胜，加拿大赢了。Nikolai当时对议会说：“被加拿大超越可以接受，但在透明度上不行。”然后我们第二年就回来了，并且赢了。在最新的评选中，我们在所有这些参数上都获得了满分。这里衡量的是我们在网站上如何报告所有这四个类别。网站是我们整个透明度机制的核心。今天，我们发布了一项新战略，配图是一张塞尼亚（Senja）美丽的雪山照片，是Segla山，我刚学会这个名字。尽管这个基金被设计为永续存在，但我们以三年为周期的战略计划来运作。这可能听起来有些奇怪，但我认为这是一个巨大的优势，因为它意味着我们可以设定方向。它首先是一个非常重要的工具，对组织而言，因为我们必须就未来的目标达成一致。但这也意味着，正如大家在过去动荡的世界中所见，上一战略计划中甚至没有提及AI，而我们近年来在这方面投入了大量精力。所以，必须有这些节点来重新校准。在我们今天提出的战略中，目标是成为全球领先且最受尊敬的投资组合。这基于五大支柱：投资、技术、运营稳健性与风险管理、人员，以及，当然，沟通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In recent years, we have further increased transparency. Nikolai referred to this world championship which I will actually introduce. It is SEM Benchmarking eh who created the Global Transparency benchmark a few years ago. That year we didn't win, the Canadians won. Nikolai then went to Parliament and said: "It's okay to be beaten by the Canadians in ice hockey, but not in openness." And then we came back the year after and then we had eh won. And now eh in the latest ranking, we have full marks on all these parameters. And here it is measured eh how we report on all these four categories on the websites. And it is the websites that are our entire transparency machinery. And then we present a new eh strategy eh today with a picture of a beautiful mountain on Senja, wasn't it? Segla. Segla I have now learned that this is. And even though this fund is designed to be perpetual, we operate with three-year eh strategic plans. This may possibly sound a bit strange, but I think it is an incredibly great eh advantage, because it means that we eh can set the direction. Eh it is primarily a tool that is very important for the organization, because we must agree on what the ambitions are going forward. But then it also means that, you saw in the turbulent world, the previous strategic plan did not mention AI at all and we have worked extremely hard on that eh in recent years. So one must have these stations where one recalibrates and eh in the strategy that we are presenting today, the goal is to be the leading and most respected investment fund in the world. And that rests on five pillars. It is investments, technology, operational robustness and risk management. It is people and then yes, it is of course communication?</p>
</details>

### 战略目标二：拓展全球视野，赢得尊重

我希望强调这一点，并希望所有将沟通未纳入其业务战略的人，都能回家与他们的领导谈谈。因为如果你不将其纳入业务战略，你如何能让整个组织参与进来？你如何能让领导层参与进来？你如何能让所有员工参与进来？所以我认为这一点极其重要。在这一战略框架内，我们有一个明确的雄心：成为世界上最开放的基金。我们看到，开放性和知识建设对我们来说非常重要。根据我们每年进行的声誉调查，我们发现，人们对我们的了解越多，就越信任我们。所以我们有了一个真正的基础来证明，建立知识是有效的。我们也注意到，在某些目标群体中，知识水平较低。这时我们可以介入并建立知识。我稍后会详细说明。我们还指出，开放性有其局限性，不应以牺牲基金的财务利益为代价。我们也会对此更加开放。这绝不能损害我们在全球市场的信誉或合法性。这意味着我们必须公开困难的选择，必须公开权衡。我们必须沟通基金是什么，也必须沟通基金不是什么。以及我们如何谈论风险，以及我们如何围绕我们周围不断变化的全景进行沟通。在介绍中，大家已经看到了其中的一小部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is so important for me to emphasize eh and I hope that all those who do not have communication as part of their business strategy go home and talk to their leader about this. Because if you are not part of the business strategy, how are you going to get the organization on board with that? How are you going to get the leadership on board? How are you going to get all the employees on board? So I think that is extremely important. And then within that strategy, eh we have a clear ambition. We shall be the world's most open fund. Eh we see that eh openness and knowledge building is eh very important for us. From the reputation survey that we eh do eh every single year, we see that the more people know about us, the more they trust us. So we have, in a way, like a real eh basis to say that building knowledge has an effect. And then we also see among some target groups that there is less knowledge. And then we can go in and build knowledge there. I will come back to that.</p>
</details>

### 战略目标三：优化内部沟通，赋能员工

在战略计划中，我们有三个目标。大家可以在这里阅读，但我将逐一介绍。首先是挪威。目标是建立知识，以提高我们在挪威最重要利益相关者中的信任度。这听起来简单，但执行起来并非易事。因此，在本战略中，我们将挪威分为两类目标受众：第一类是我们称之为“最重要的利益相关者”。第二类是挪威民众。对于最重要的利益相关者，他们以议会为代表，所以这并不令人意外，他们是决策者，当然还有媒体、金融界，我们还将扩大范围至我们的重要机构。因为这关系到提供更深入的见解和理解，以便他们能够做出明智的决策。他们能够做出自己的决定，但这些决定必须是基于信息的。我们还希望有一个客观的公共辩论。然后是挪威民众，特别是年轻群体，我们今天也会听到更多关于他们的信息。他们在基金方面的知识要少得多。他们必须从零开始建立知识。这需要一种不同的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we also say that this strategy, but openness has its limitations because it should not be at the expense of the fund's financial interests. And we will also be much more open about that. So it should never harm our credibility or legitimacy in the global markets. So that also means that we must be open about difficult choices. We must be open about trade-offs. We must communicate what the fund is and we must communicate what the fund is not. and a little about how we are going to talk about risk and how we communicate around the whole picture that is moving around us. You got a little taste of that in the introduction. So in the strategic plan, we have three goals. You can read them here, but I will go through them eh one by one. So we start in Norway. And then the goal is to build knowledge to increase trust among our most important stakeholders in Norway. So simple, but not necessarily so easy to implement.</p>
</details>

我们在战略中写道，我们将专注于核心信息。这听起来也很基础。但我们认为，关键在于进一步明确核心信息。那是什么？它是最根本的。基金到底是什么？我们为何存在？我们如何管理这笔财富？要清晰地传达这些核心信息并非总是易事。因此，自有渠道非常重要，但从零开始的知识建设也同样重要。对年轻人进行知识建设。我们稍后会听到更多关于我们如何与半年度合作开展社交媒体工作。这对于不阅读报纸、不看电视的年轻受众来说非常重要，不像老一代人那样。近年来，我们投入了大量精力来招募最优秀的人才。我们希望所有最优秀的学生，无论他们学习什么专业，都能考虑我们作为雇主。因此，我们设立了一个客座讲座项目，并投入大量时间在大学进行推广。我们设立了一个女性投资俱乐部，因为我们发现女性申请者很少。这些是我们能做的事情。这是一项非常长期的工作，不一定能立即看到结果。但我们确实看到了一些成果，因为我们俱乐部中有两位学生现在在沟通部门工作。当然，还有我们透明度机制，它也必须与社交媒体很好地结合，并不断思考新的、更具活动导向的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So eh we distinguish between two target groups in Norway in this strategy. The first is what we call our most important stakeholders. The second is the Norwegian people. So for the most important stakeholders, it is illustrated by the Stortinget, so it is not surprising that it is decision-makers, then it is of course eh media, eh then it is the financial environment, and then we will also broaden it in relation to our important institutions. Because what it is about is providing deeper insight and understanding so that they can again make informed decisions. They can make their own decisions, but they must be informed. And then we naturally want a factual public debate. And then it is the Norwegian people, especially younger target groups, about whom we will also hear more today. And there are completely different prerequisites. They know much less about the funds. They must build knowledge from scratch. And that requires a different approach.</p>
</details>

### 战略目标二：拓展全球视野，赢得尊重

然后，我们将走向世界。作为投资者，我们依赖于在运营市场中受到欢迎和尊重。我们许多员工都在与外部参与者进行持续的对话。这可能是我们投资的公司、监管机构、市场或与其他投资者。因此，这对我们来说极其重要。我们还积极致力于建立牢固的关系，加强我们作为知识渊博、负责任所有者的地位。这里的目标受众主要是我们投资的公司，我们投资于70个市场，我们不能跑遍所有70个市场。我们沟通部门专注于我们设有办公室的市场，即新加坡、伦敦和欧洲，以及纽约和美国。我们首先利用我们的员工，这一点我稍后会详细说明。其次是国际媒体机构。因为在外面，我们的渠道可能不那么被关注或使用，除了播客和一些YouTube内容。因此，与国际媒体机构建立良好关系至关重要。我们有良好的关系，但我们将继续大力加强这方面的工作，这对我们来说极其重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we write in the strategy that we want a focus on core messages. That also sounds incredibly basic. Eh, but we believe that a lot of the key lies there in becoming even clearer about the core message. Eh, what is it? It is the most fundamental. What is openness? Why do we exist? How do we manage this fortune? And it's not always easy to come up with these core messages, so of course own channels eh are very important, but it is also knowledge building from scratch. Knowledge building among the young. We will hear more eh about how we work with eh social media eh from half-year. Of course, very important towards younger target groups who do not read newspapers eh follow TV and so on eh like the older generations. Then we have spent a lot of time in recent years recruiting the very best people. We want the best people who in a way study anything at all to think of us as an employer. So we eh have created a guest lecture program and spend a lot of time being out at eh universities. We have created an eh investment club for women because we see that we have few female applicants. And these are things we can do. It is a very long-term effort. One does not necessarily see results eh immediately. We have some results because we actually have two students from that club who work in the communications department today. And then of course this transparency machinery of ours, which must also communicate very well with social media and not least think anew and more campaign-oriented.</p>

仅在八月份，情况就有些达到顶峰。在此之前，我们平均每月看到3000条关于基金的媒体报道。仅八月份，我们就看到了超过8000条关于基金的媒体报道。在一个普通月份，大约60%-70%的报道是国际性的。所以，这显然是我们必须关注的一个非常大的图景。这张图表信息量很大，所以我需要解释一下。因为现在我们已经实施了一个从2023年到2025年的战略。当Nikolai来这里时，他做的第一件事之一就是改变了规定。我当然有所有事情的指导方针。我们有财务。我们热爱它。Eh，那就是改变了外部发言的指导方针，因为上面写着你必须获得批准，而且你实际上不能这样做。所以我们改变了它。现在我们所有的员工都可以外出参加会议。当然，有些事情他们需要考虑。Eh，但我们非常努力地工作，以实现规模经济。人们如何能够出来并自己交付成果？所以Nikolai在几年前做了一个四分之一的改变。然后是侧面的图表，大家可以看到所有其他 eh 员工。我们有Nikolai，略高于100人。他实际上低估了。想想看。在过去一年里，有147名员工代表基金在外部发声。这仅仅是三年内的翻倍。为什么这对我们很重要？首先，你不一定有，现在他已经进入了新的任期，但你不一定有你顶尖的男士或女士。Eh，不仅仅是我们管理层需要外出发言。Eh，但此外，你还有员工，你有在特定目标群体和特定市场中发言最好的专家。所以这对我们来说变得极其重要。

<p class="english-text">And then we shall go out into the world. As an investor, we depend on being welcomed and respected in the markets in which we operate. And very many of our employees are in ongoing dialogue with external actors. It can be companies we are invested in, it can be regulators, marketplaces or other investors. So it is, they are incredibly important to us. Eh, and then we work very actively on building strong relationships, strengthening our position as a knowledgeable and responsible owner. And the target groups here are, first and foremost, the companies we invest in, we invest in 70 markets, we cannot run around and necessarily be in 70 markets, we in the communications department focus on the markets where we have offices, so it is Singapore eh London and Europe, and then it is New York USA. And what we do is that we primarily use our employees. And I will come back to that. And secondly, it is the international media houses. Because out there, our channels are not necessarily seen or used much, with the exception of podcasts and some YouTube. So there are of course good relationships with the international media houses. We have good relationships, but we must continue to build that enormously important for us.</p>

然后是播客。奥斯陆的，不，抱歉，挪威最大的商业播客。下载量超过1100万次。但令我们惊讶的是，我们开始时并未完全预料到的是，它对我们全球业务的重要性有多么巨大。现在，它主要对我们全球业务至关重要，尤其是在金融市场建立尊重和信誉方面。它扩大了我们的国际影响力。此外，它还意味着我们实际上能与公司进行更好的对话，他们将更频繁地与我们的投资组合经理会面。

<p class="english-text">Just in August, it peaked a bit then. Before that, we saw an average of 3,000 media cases per month about the fund. In August alone, we saw over 8,000 media cases about the fund. In a normal month, approximately 60% 70% of those are eh international. So it is clear that this is a very large picture for us to keep track of. This graph was very busy so I saw I had to explain it because into it eh now we have had a strategy that went from 2023 to 2025. When Nikolai came in here, one of the first things we did was to change. I have guidelines for everything. We have finance. We love it. Eh it was to change the guideline for speaking externally because it said there that you must have approval and you can't really do it. So we changed it. And now all our employees are allowed to go out and speak at a conference. Of course, there are things they must consider. Eh, but we work very hard in a way, like economies of scale. How is it going to be for people to be able to come out and deliver on this themselves? So Nikolai made a quarter eh just a few years ago. And then there is the graph on the side here which you see all the other eh employees. We have Nikolai is a little over 100. He actually understated. Think about it. 147 employees have represented the fund externally in the year that has been. And that is a doubling eh in just the three years. And why is it important for us? Well, number one, you don't necessarily have, now he has taken a new term, but you don't necessarily have the man, the woman you have at the top. Eh, it's not just us in the management group who should go out and speak. Eh, but in addition, you have employees, you have subject matter experts who speak best to those target groups and in those markets out there. So it has become enormously important for us.</p>

### 战略目标三：优化内部沟通，赋能员工

最后一个目标，非常重要。Nikolai花了很多时间谈论它：内部沟通。我们的目标是为员工发挥最佳水平创造条件，通过有效的内部沟通。近年来，我们在内部沟通方面做了大量工作，但实际上只有一个人全职负责此事。所以，再次强调规模经济的重要性。我们必须拥有它。因此，我们将内部沟通视为一个共同的责任，既在沟通部门内部，也在跨部门之间。我们有一个专门的SharePoint（微软 SharePoint：一个用于文档管理、信息共享和协作的平台）区域，员工可以在那里找到所有信息，以便有效地沟通。在下一个战略周期中，我们将非常关注投资内容。这对我们很重要，既能进行长远思考，也能突出优秀案例和精彩故事，激励他人。第二点是我提到的我们的国际办事处。这并不意味着我们不关注奥斯陆总部，但我们必须将这些办事处联系起来。当你运营在如此多的不同时区、如此多不同的文化中，拥有来自33个以上国籍的员工时，你该如何做到这一点？我们已经启动了所谓的“全球全体员工大会”。每年四次，我们会在各地巡回举行全体会议，并展示来自海外办事处的优秀案例，以期将大家凝聚在一起，并传播好故事。今年，我们非常非常关注人工智能，AI的例子被用在了所有这些全体会议上。

<p class="english-text">And then we have the podcast. Oslo's, no, sorry, Norway's largest business podcast. Downloaded over 11 million times. But what eh surprised us and what we didn't quite see when we started this was how enormously important it would become for us globally. And now it is primarily important for us globally in terms of creating eh the respect and the credibility out there in the financial markets. So it increases our international reach. And then eh it also means that we actually get an even better eh dialogue eh with the companies and they will meet our portfolio managers eh more often.</p>
</details>

在新战略中，有一句话在我们周一向组织展示时，我花了一些时间来谈论。那就是“内部沟通是共同的责任”。我们进行互动，我们进行双向沟通，我们有“周一会议”，所有员工都可以参与，讨论市场上的最新动态。这意味着，如果你有了一次经历，你就必须分享你学到的东西。这是信息共享的共同责任。在这方面，我们正在变得越来越好。我们有内向的人，我们有喜欢坐在那里摆弄Excel表格的人，但我们已经取得了长足的进步。我们当然全力押注人工智能。这是介绍Sigur和Sara的切入点，他们将就此进行讨论。

<p class="english-text">Last goal. Very important. Nikolai used all the time talking about it. Internal communication. We shall facilitate employees doing their best through effective internal communication is eh the goal. We have worked very hard with eh internal communication eh in recent eh years, but we actually only have one person traveling around eh who works full-time with it. So, once again economies of scale eh you must have. So we see internal communication as a shared responsibility, both within the communication department, but also across MBM. So we have a dedicated SharePoint area where employees find everything to be able to communicate effectively. And then in the next strategic period, we will have a strong focus on investment content. And that is important for us to be able to think long-term, but also to highlight good examples, good stories, inspire others. Then there is number two, which I highlight, which is our international offices. That does not mean that we will not focus here at the head office eh in Oslo, but we must bring these offices together. And how do you do that when you operate in so many different time zones, so many different cultures, employees from more than 33 nationalities. So we have started with something we call global town halls. So four times a year we tour around. And then we hold general meetings at the various overseas offices and highlight good examples from the overseas offices to try to bring this together eh and bring forward good stories. And this year we have had a lot of focus on AI, so AI examples have been used in all these town halls.</p>

<p class="english-text">And then in the new strategy, there is a sentence eh that when we eh on Monday eh presented this to the organization. I spent some time talking about. And it is internal communication is a shared responsibility. Eh, we use eh, we engage, we have two-way communication, we have something we call Monday meetings for all employees eh eh call in and talk about what is happening eh in the markets here and now. So it's about if you've had an experience, you have to share what you learn. It is a shared responsibility to contribute to information sharing. And it's getting better and better. We have introverted people. We have people who like to sit and nurture their Excel spreadsheets, but we have come a long way. And then we are of course betting fully on AI. And that is the segway to introducing Sigur and Sara who will talk about it.</p>
