title: 美国银行如何应对监管与创新挑战：从SVB危机到金融科技的未来

### 硅谷银行危机：传统业务模式的意外失败

**Tracy Aloway:** 几年前，如果我告诉你有一家银行，它吸收存款，比如活期账户，然后把这些钱投资于美国国债，但这种商业模式最终会彻底失败，银行会倒闭，你会怎么说？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, if I had said to you a few years ago that there's a bank and the bank is taking deposits, you know, checking accounts, and it's putting that money into US treasuries and that business model is going to completely fail, the bank is going to collapse. What would you have said?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 呃，我会说：“我们做空这只股票吧。”我就是这么说的。如果你告诉我这个，并且你只知道这一个可操作的见解，我就会说：“好吧，我们做空它。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I would have said, "Let's short the stock." That's what I would have said. I said if you told me that and you knew the only insight the only actionable thing there I said all right let's short it</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 好的，这显然是正确的答案。如果你是银行监管机构，你会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all right that's the right answer clearly if you were a banking regulator what would you have done</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我不知道如何做银行监管，这看起来真的很难，而且监管机构通常会受到各种批评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I don't know anything about being a banking regular it seems really hard and regulators in general often get criticized in various ways</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 他们会说：“哦，你捣毁了这个小规模的科技交易圈，这没什么大不了的。”或者“哦，这里有个东西倒闭了，你为什么之前没发现？”他们总是会为此感到不安。但我必须说，我非常同情监管机构，因为在大多数情况下，我的印象是美国拥有世界上最健全、最透明、深度最高的资本市场和金融系统之一，而且在大多数情况下，它并没有崩溃。所以我觉得，当涉及到监管问题时，有很多我们看不到的东西，我们看到的只是如果它们上了新闻，那就不是好事。但大多数时候，事情并没有上新闻。这应该是美国金融系统的标语：大多数时候不会崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they're like oh you busted this really small time ticky tech etc trading ring it's not that big of a deal or oh here's this uh thing that collapsed and why didn't you catch it before? They're always going to get upset about that. But I have to say I have a lot of sympathy for the regulators because for the most part my impression is that the US has one of the most robust, transparent, high-epth capital markets and financial systems in the entire world, which for the most part does not collapse. And so I feel like when it comes to regulatory issues, there's a lot of unseen where what we see is like if they're in the news, it's not good. But most of the time things aren't in the news. That should be the tagline for America's uh financial system. Most of the time does not collapse.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 并非反讽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unironically.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 当然，我指的是**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank: SVB）及其倒闭事件。这对我来说仍然非常令人惊讶。从某种意义上说，这是一场老式的银行挤兑，但从另一个意义上说，一家银行基本上购买了一堆超安全的资产——美国国债，却仍然陷入困境，这非常令人惊讶。当然，银行也被要求购买国债。我们已经在节目中多次讨论过这个问题了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I'm talking of course or I was talking about Silicon Valley Bank and the collapse there. And I think it's still very surprising to me. In in one sense, it was an old-fashioned bank run, but in another sense, it's very surprising that here's a bank that's basically buying a bunch of ultra safe assets, US treasuries, and still it ran into trouble. And banks of course are mandated to buy treasuries as well. We've talked about this on the show any number of times now. But</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我想多谈谈这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk more about it.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 当然。你知道，关于SVB，我一直在思考的一点是，我认为在2008-2009年金融危机之后，我们非常关注资产负债表的资产端，对吧？所以就像，“哦，他们有什么？他们有多少次级贷款？它们的质量如何？”等等。但其中一点，你知道，就像**乔什·扬格**（Josh Younger）最近谈到的，以及**斯蒂芬·凯利**（Stephen Kelly）在我们通讯中提到的一样，很多问题在于负债端建模的难度，以及存款基础的流动性，这很难了解，因为你可能拥有长期存款，但它们突然变成了隔夜存款。这真的很棘手，我仍然认为这些是难以理解的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. You know, the one thing I'll say too that I've been thinking a lot with SVB is I think in the wake of the 2008 2009 financial crisis, we got very focused on the asset side of the balance sheet, right? And so it's like, oh, what do they have? What kind of subprime loans do they have and how good are their all of that, etc. But one of the things, you know, like Josh Younger talked about recently and others, Stephen Kelly had a note in our newsletter, you know, a lot of it is the difficulty in modeling the liability side and the slipperiness of the deposit base and how hard that is to know because you can have long duration deposits that suddenly become overnight deposits. It's really tricky and I still think these are difficult things to understand.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，感觉我们总是在打上一场银行战或上一场债券战。好的。那么，就此而言，我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾。我们将与**罗伊特·乔普拉**（Roit Chopra）对话。他当然是**消费者金融保护局**（Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: CFPB）的前局长，也是**联邦贸易委员会**（Federal Trade Commission: FTC）的前委员，所以如果我们想深入了解SVB发生了什么，它对银行监管意味着什么，以及银行现在正在做什么，他绝对是完美的对话人选。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it feels like we're always fighting the last bank battle or the last bond battle. Okay. Well, on that note, we do in fact have the perfect guest. We are going to be speaking with Roit Chopra. He is, of course, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, also a former FTC commissioner, so really the perfect person to talk to if we want to dig into what happened to SVB, what it means for bank regulation, and then also what banks are doing right now. Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 罗伊特，非常感谢你来参加《Odd Lots》播客。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Roit, thank you so much for coming on a thoughts.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 谢谢邀请。

<p class="english-text">Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

### CFPB的职能与当前困境

**Tracy Aloway:** 这是我的第一个问题。也许有点尖锐，但**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）还存在吗？我们刚刚通过了一项庞大而美丽的法案，看起来它削减了该局的资金。当然，我们知道特朗普并不完全是联邦机构的拥护者。所以我很好奇，它还在运作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's my first question. Maybe it's a little pointed, but does the CFPB still exist? So, we just got the one big beautiful bill that's been passed and it looks like it slashes funding for the bureau. And of course, we know that Trump isn't exactly a fan of federal agencies. So, I'm curious, is it still functioning?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 它已经有点被掏空了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was already kind of gutted.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的。总之，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Anyway,</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 是的，这是个好问题。而且从所有证据来看，它可能只是技术上存在，但什么也没做。我们几乎每天都听到又有金融机构被解除义务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, it's a good question. And it seems by every single piece of evidence that it's just maybe there technically, but not doing a damn thing. We are hearing nearly every day about another financial institution that is being released from obligations.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 已经好几个月没有执法行动了，许多人估计这意味着消费者将无法追回数十亿美元的退款，坦率地说，这对所有遵守规则的金融公司来说都是一个巨大的劣势。当它运作时，或者说当它运行时，请向我描述一下CFPB的职责范围是什么，人们对它的批评之一是他们不知道其范围等等。CFPB的正式范围是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has been months since there has been an enforcement action and many are estimating that this means billions and billions of dollars that consumers are not getting back in refunds and frankly a big disadvantage to all of those financial companies that follow the rules. when it was working when it or when it was operating. Describe to me what the remmit of the CFPB is and one of the criticisms of the that people leveled is they didn't know what the scope was etc. What is the formal scope of the CFPB?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，几十年前我们基本上看到，提供消费贷款和产品的不仅仅是银行。还有各种其他公司，发薪日贷款机构、汽车贷款机构，事实上，现在大部分抵押贷款和汽车贷款都是在银行之外发起的。所以在次级抵押贷款危机之后，大家普遍认为**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve Board）和其他机构没有集中精力确保现有的消费者法律得到遵守。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, essentially we saw decades ago that there weren't just banks in the business of offering consumer loans and products. It was all sorts of other companies, payday lenders, auto lenders, and in fact now the bulk of mortgages are originated outside of banks, the bulk of auto loans. And so after the subprime mortgage crisis, there was broad agreement that the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies just didn't focus and have the attention on making sure that existing consumer law</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 正在被遵守。因此，CFPB负责检查最大的金融机构，并在它们违法时将其告上法庭。当然，它还负责管理各种规则，以确保抵押贷款市场、信用报告公司以及许多其他机构遵守规定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">was being followed. So the CFPB is responsible for inspecting the largest financial institutions and taking them to court when they break the law. Of course, also administering all sorts of rules that keep the mortgage markets, the credit report, credit reporting companies, and so many others in line.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** CFPB如何与其他所有银行政策利益相关者互动？因为似乎有很多。你是指其他监管机构吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does the CFPB interact with all the other bank policy stakeholders? Because there there seems to be quite a few. You mean the other regulators?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，当然，CFPB是唯一一个监管庞大的非银行消费贷款机构的监管机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, certainly the CFPB is the only regulator that oversees that gigantic non-bank consumer lending apparatus</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 此外，它对所有资产超过100亿美元的银行和信用合作社拥有主要和专属管辖权。这意味着市场上的每一家信用卡公司、每一个大型参与者都主要由CFPB监管。因此，它现在实际上成为了一条“死鱼”，留下了一个非常非常大的空白，没有人甚至可以合法地填补。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and also it has primary and exclusive jurisdiction over all banks and credit unions over 10 billion in assets. That means every credit card company, every big player in the market is primarily overseen by the CFPB. So the fact that it is now functionally a dead fish is leaving a very very big gap that no one can even legally fill in.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 当你审视当前的消费者金融格局时，你认为最大的空白体现在哪里？在你看来，哪些方面没有得到执行或审查，但值得执行或审查？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where do you see the biggest gap manifesting right now when you look at the consumer financial landscape? What isn't being enforced or what isn't being examined that in your view merits enforcement or examination? Well, I</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我认为首要任务始终是努力理解最大市场与更广泛经济之间的联系。我们看到抵押贷款市场与经济的这种联系非常巨大，它的失败不仅导致美国金融系统崩溃，也导致整个全球市场崩溃。所以，当然，要确保抵押贷款公平透明，确保像**合格抵押贷款规则**（Qualified Mortgage Rule: 设定抵押贷款承销标准以防止掠夺性贷款的法规）这样的关键规则得到遵守，以确保没有掠夺性抵押贷款。但乔，还有一些具体细节问题。大多数问题都来自信用报告上出现错误的人。他们会说：“那甚至不是我的名字。”或者银行账户因欺诈而被非法扣款或清空的人。还有各种保护特定人群的问题，比如军人，以及许多其他维持市场运作的方面。所以，我不想具体指出任何一点，只想说当我上任时，是在几年之后，当时那里确实没什么进展。我们看到金融公司不仅挑战底线，有时甚至公然利用人们，却没有任何问责。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">think the top priority is always trying to understand the linkage between the biggest markets and the broader economy. We saw that that linkage with the mortgage market was pretty damn big and its failure really crashed not just the US financial system but the entire global marketplace. So, of course, making sure that mortgages are fair and transparent, that key rules like the qualified mortgage rule, which sets some of the core standards to make sure there is not predatory mortgage lending, but also Joe, the nuts and bolts. Most of the issues that come in are people who have errors on their credit report. They say, "That's not even my name." or people whose bank accounts were illegally debited or cleaned out due to fraud. There's all sorts of issues that protect specific populations, military members, and so many other pieces that keep the markets working. So, I don't want to pinpoint anything other than to say that when I took office, it was after another few years where there really wasn't much going on there. And we saw how financial firms not just pushed the envelope but sometimes outright took advantage of people without any accountability.</p>
</details>

### SVB危机：导火索与深层原因

**Tracy Aloway:** 谈到问责制，我们节目开头提到了SVB，我听说人们在分析那次银行倒闭的根本原因时，有点像“鸡生蛋，蛋生鸡”的局面。有些人说，利率上升导致银行债券持有出现账面亏损，所以人们感到紧张并开始提取资金。另一些人则说，即使债券亏损不一定需要很快变现，人们也开始提取资金。所以我很好奇，你能指出引发最近一次银行危机的那颗火花吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speaking of accountability, you know, we mentioned SVB at the top of the show, and one thing I've heard, there's a little bit of a chicken and egg situation when people are analyzing the root cause of that particular bank collapse. So some people say, well, interest rates went up and that led to paper losses on the bank's bond holdings, and so people got nervous and started pulling their money. And then other people say, well, people started pulling their money even though the bond losses didn't necessarily need to be crystallized anytime soon. So I'm curious, can you pinpoint the spark that set off the latest bank crisis? Well, for me it really was March 8th</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 2023年3月8日。那天发生了两件事。一是**银门银行**（Silvergate Bank）的清盘，该银行大量参与了为一些主要的加密货币交易平台提供银行服务。在加密货币寒冬和FTX崩溃之后，该银行出现了存款外流。我曾在**联邦存款保险公司**（Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: FDIC）董事会任职，我们一直在追踪银门银行，那天他们宣布不需要被**接管**（Receiverhip: 当一家银行倒闭时，由监管机构控制其资产并进行清算或出售的过程），他们将自行清算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2023. Two things happened that day. One was the windown of a bank called Silvergate Bank which was heavily involved in banking some of the major crypto trading platforms. There was a flight of deposits out of that bank after the crypto winter and the collapse of FTX. We had been tracking I serve on the FDIC board and we were tracking Silvergate Bank and on that day they announced that they were not going to need to be put into receiverhip. they would be self-liquidating.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 同时，就在同一天，**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）发布了一份有点滑稽的新闻稿，称他们证券投资组合出现了一些实际亏损，并且正在寻求资本。这引发了许多危险信号和对其生存能力的怀疑。这对于银行业和存款业务来说是如此基础的一点，那就是它确实建立在你的钱会一直在那里的信念之上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And simultaneously on that same day, we had an announcement by Silicon Valley Bank, which is a little bit of a goofy press release they issued, saying they're experiencing some real losses on their securities portfolio and they're going to be looking for capital. It raised a lot of red flags and suspicions about whether they were viable. And this is something that is just so fundamental about banking and deposit taking is that it really is based on a belief that your money is going to be there.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 事实是，有了联邦存款保险和**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve）的**贴现窗口**（Discount Window: 美联储向银行提供短期贷款的机制）贷款，你的钱总会在那里。除非你有一家银行，其90%以上的存款未受保。这真的很不寻常，有些人甚至会认为这根本不是一家银行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the truth is is with federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve discount window lending, it always is. Except when you have a bank that is over 90% uninsured deposits. This is something that is really unusual and some would argue is not even really a bank</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 当你如此依赖那些增长如此迅速的超大储户时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you are that dependent on very very large depositors that you grew so quickly</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 于是挤兑就开始了。你认为这在多大程度上归因于未受保存款的高比例，以及集中度？比如，在非常具体的行业中。你提到了加密货币行业，但这里还有所有这些在2020年和2021年筹集了大量资金的初创公司。其中许多公司显然只是把钱存入了银行，这对我来说有点奇怪，而且是未受保的。然后我们在2022年经历了股市暴跌。资金枯竭。几乎没有新的风险投资募资。所以没有新的“干粉”可以存入银行。初创公司只是为了支付工资或其他开支而提取自己的存款。所以你有两件事同时发生。一是未受保存款的高水平，但也有集中度。所以有一个特定的行业同时经历了整个周期。所以让我强调一下，即使它是一个行业，我同意你的观点，集中度

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so then the run began. How much would you ascribe it to the high percentage of non-insured deposits versus the concentration? So, in very specific industries. So, you mentioned the crypto one, but also here were all of these startups that had raised a ton of money in 2020 and 2021. A bunch of them apparently just put their money in a bank, which is kind of weird to me, and uninsured. And then we had the stock market plunge in 2022. Funding dried up. There was no very little new VC fundraising. So new dry powder to be put into the bank. Startups drawing down their own deposits just to make payroll or whatever else. And so you have two things going on. One is the high level of uninsured deposits, but also the concentration. So that there was this one specific sector that was all going through the cycle at the same time. So let me just push on that because even though it is one sector and I agree with you the concentration</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 是一个重要因素，但我们应该记住，那些由风险投资资助的个体公司，其中许多经营状况良好。这些企业不一定存在特定的或系统性的问题。但我认为，我同意所有中小型企业的观点。如果我正在创办一家初创公司，无论是人工智能公司还是干洗店，我的银行倒闭不会排在我业务失败的20个主要原因之列。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">was an important factor in this but let's remember that the individual firms that were funded by venture capital many of them were doing fine. Um there was not necessarily something specifically or systemically wrong with those businesses. But I think and I agree with every small and midsize business out there. If I am launching a startup, whether it is an AI company or a dry cleaner, it doesn't rank in the top 20 reasons of my business failing that my bank is going to fail.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 当然。所以你开始听到的是，这些高度网络化的企业，以及更快的沟通，你会从你的资助者和其他人那里得到你需要跑路的建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. And so what you start hearing is that these businesses which are highly networked as well as much faster communication, you get the advice from your funders and others that you need to run.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 很明显，这不仅仅发生在SVB，而是发生在整个系统。我当时正坐火车去康涅狄格州，有人坐在我旁边，结果他们的公司是SVB的客户，我能听到他们消化新闻时声音中的恐慌。但就此而言，为什么公司财务主管要把所有存款都存入一家银行，而他们大概知道FDIC保险有上限？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was very clear that it was not just happening at SVB, it then was happening all over the system. I was on a train to Connecticut around that time and someone was sitting kind of close to me and it turned out they were banking with SVB. Their company was and I could hear the panic in their voice as they tried to like digest the news of what was happening. But on that note, why did corporate treasurers why did they put all their deposits in a single bank when presumably they know that there's a cap on FDIC insurance?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 是的，这是个好问题。我认为对于一些中小型企业来说，当他们支付工资或收到大量款项时，存在一些实际问题。我对一些通过公开报告了解到将大量资金，包括他们全部现金储备，存入那家银行的超大型公司没有那么多同情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it it's a good question. I think there are some practical issues for some small and midsize businesses about when you're running payroll or when you're getting in a lot of receipts. I don't have as much sympathy for some of the very large companies that we have learned through public reporting put a whole lot of funds in that bank</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 包括他们全部现金储备。所以，归根结底，监管机构，我们看到了正在发生的活跃挤兑，当然，那些受保储户，受保储户在整个危机中并没有真正挤兑。是那些未受保的储户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">including really their entire cash reserves. So at the end of the day though the regulators we had we saw an active run that was occurring and of course those insured depositors the insured depositors really through the entire crisis did not really run. It was those uninsured</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 它始于**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank），在周三发布公告后，到周五早上，他们就倒闭了。我们实际上在前一天晚上，或者说在黎明前，投票决定接受其**接管**（Receiverhip），我相信到它关闭时，已经有大约数千亿美元的对外电汇排队等待发出。所以这是一次巨大而快速的挤兑。许多我们经常听到的那些技术自由主义者，他们不想要任何监管，却在线上积极鼓吹，要求

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it beca it started at Silicon Valley Bank after that Wednesday release by Friday morning they were dead. We had actually voted the night before or maybe at the pre-dawn hours to accept it into receiverhip and I believe by the time it was closed it had roughly $und00 billion queued up of outbound wires. So this was an enormous and fast run. And many of those technol libertarians that we often hear about who want no regulation, they were actively beating the drum online asking</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 寻求救助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for a bailout.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，这实际上是一个有趣的观点，我接下来也打算谈到这一点，我认为这又是**斯蒂芬·凯利**（Stephen Kelly）为我们写的一篇文章中提到的，但关于2023年的一件事，我认为他说那不是一场区域性银行危机，而是一场区域银行危机，特指加利福尼亚州这个区域，因为当时还有其他一些银行也陷入了很大的麻烦，它们唯一的共同点是都以某种方式与加利福尼亚州有关。我想我记得当时人们都在寻找任何名字中带有“加利福尼亚”字样的银行，并做空它们。但请告诉我们，在一个充满这些网络的世界里，无论是社交媒体上的公共网络，还是志同道合的人组成的WhatsApp群组，如何监管银行和监控挤兑？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this is actually interesting point and I was going to go there next and I think again it was a thing that Stephen Kelly wrote for us, but one of the things about 2023 I think he said it wasn't a crisis of regional banks. It was a regional bank crisis as in specifically the region of California because then there were other parts of there were other banks that got into a lot of trouble and the all thing they had in common was that they were all sort of in some way connected to California. I think I remember like people were going out looking for any bank that had California in the title in some way and betting against them. But talk to us about regulating banks and monitoring runs in a world of these networks, whether they're the public networks on social media or just the sort of networks of like-minded individuals who are all in the same WhatsApp group.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 是的，我相信我们永远无法对抗，也不应该想要对抗沟通的速度。我们希望市场拥有实时信息。我会说，我们首先在**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）看到了挤兑的开始，然后我认为由于与**银门银行**（Silvergate Bank）的多种因素汇合，这不仅仅是加利福尼亚州的问题，而是任何似乎与加密货币或科技相关联的银行。当然，我们周日关闭的第二家银行是**Signature Bank**，它运营着一个加密货币网络，但也有非常真实的业务。它是一家纽约市的银行，深度参与了纽约市的多户住宅房地产。乔，你同时也在担心商业房地产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'm a believer that we can never fight and we shouldn't want to fight the speed of communication. We want markets to have live information. I will say this, we saw the run start first at Silicon Valley Bank and then I think because of the confluence of factors with Silvergate, it wasn't just California is anything that seemed to have any crypto or tech adjacency. Of course, the second bank that we closed that Sunday was Signature Bank, which operated a crypto network, but also had a very real business. It is a New York City bank that was deeply involved in New York City multifamily real estate. You at the same time Joe had people worried about commercial real estate.</p>

**Roit Chopra:** 但我们看到的是，未受保存款比例最高的银行，几乎立即遭受了重创。

### 监管应对与争议：扩大存款保险与BTFP

**Tracy Aloway:** 所以最终做出了扩大存款保险范围的决定，基本上是救助了SVB的客户和其他人。做出这个决定的过程是怎样的？这个决定有多重要？这个决定会留下什么遗产？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So ultimately a decision was made to expand the deposit insurance net and basically bail out SVB customers and others. What was the decision-making process like building up to that? And how big a deal is that? Is there like a legacy from that decision?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 这是一个非常重大的决定，而且在很多方面，即使它是正确的决定，仍然难以接受。我认为，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a very big deal and it's one that in many ways is still hard to live with the decision even though it was the right decision. I think</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 它是这样运作的。联邦法律基本上指示**联邦存款保险公司**（FDIC）以对存款保险基金成本最低的方式解决倒闭银行的问题。这个基金是每个人通过银行存款支付的，它建立了一个基金来支付某些银行倒闭的费用，并确保存款得到全额偿付。关于**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）、**Signature Bank**以及后来的**First Republic**，有趣的是，它们都有超多数的未受保存款。这意味着解决银行倒闭的成本并不高。对于一家90%以上存款未受保的银行，存款保险基金的成本会相当低。如果法律规定以最低成本解决，在很多情况下，最好的情况有时是清算它，尽可能多地让人们得到全额偿付，并用存款保险基金补足他们。但法律中有一个附加条款，规定如果银行倒闭可能导致系统性影响或威胁美国金融系统的生存能力，则有一系列监管机构必须遵循的关键程序，向财政部长提出建议，财政部长必须与总统协商，授权FDIC采取不同的路径。所以在周末，也就是**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）倒闭后的周日，大约在周日早上，**Signature Bank**被**接管**（Receiverhip）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">here's how it works. The federal law basically directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, to resolve a failed bank at the least cost to the deposit insurance fund. That's the fund that everyone pays into with their bank deposits. And it builds up a fund to pay for certain bank failures and make sure deposits are made whole. And here's what was interesting about Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and then later First Republic. It was a super majority of uninsured deposits. That means a bank failure is not that expensive to resolve. the cost to the deposit insurance fund for a bank that is 90% plus uninsured is going to be pretty low. And if the law says resolve it at the least cost, in many ways the best case is sometimes to liquidate it, make as many people whole as possible and top them up with the deposit insurance fund. But there is a proviso in the law which says that if a failure is likely to lead to systemic effects or to threaten the viability of the US financial system. There's a process of key turning that a series of regulators must go through to recommend to the Treasury Secretary who must consult with the president to authorize the FDIC to take a different path. So over the weekend, the Sunday after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Sunday morning roughly, Signature Bank was taken into receiverhip.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** **First Republic**已经像僵尸一样，基本上已经死了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First Republic was a zombie and basically dead already.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 当时有一个决定，FDIC董事会投票决定启动该程序，联邦储备委员会也投票决定启动该程序，最终财政部长与总统讨论后，激活了该权力。该权力实质上导致了所有未受保存款的担保。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a decision where the FDIC board, we voted to turn that key and the Federal Reserve Board had voted to turn that key and ultimately the Treasury Secretary discussed it with the president and activated that authority. The authority essentially led to the backstopping of all uninsured deposits.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 这意味着在银行倒闭的情况下，每个人都会得到全额赔偿，这是一个艰难的决定。我认为当时有一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That meant that everyone would be made whole in the case of the failure and it was a tough decision. I think there was a question.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我当时在争论和质疑我们是否应该大幅提高限额，也许提高到2500万或5000万美元。我们当时在系统中看到的是未受保存款到处都在积极流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was arguing and questioning should we be maybe raising the limit dramatically perhaps to 25 or $50 million. What we were seeing in the system was active movement of uninsured deposits everywhere.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 最终，援引该例外的决定确实在很大程度上平息了系统，除了**First Republic Bank**这个大例外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And ultimately the decision to invoke that exception really did calm the system for the most part with the big exception of First Republic Bank.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 那么，除了扩大存款保险之外，另一件事是创建了一个新的美联储贷款工具。又是一个缩写，BTFP。这个有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the other thing that happened other than the expanded deposit insurance was the creation of a new Fed lending facility. Another acronym, the BTFP. How big a deal was that one?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 那个很奇怪。所有银行都有能力通过**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve）的**贴现窗口**（Discount Window）获取资金，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That one was weird. All banks have the ability to access the discount window through the Federal Reserve, right?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 但联邦储备委员会利用了一些救助权力来启动这个**银行定期融资计划**（Bank Term Funding Program: BTFP）。这允许银行以面值抵押其国债证券，并提取资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the Federal Reserve used some bailout authorities to launch this bank term funding program. This allowed banks to pledge their Treasury securities at par and draw</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 从联邦储备委员会提取资金。我认为我们中很多人对此感到惊讶。如果银行已经可以通过**贴现窗口**（Discount Window）获取资金，为什么还需要这个特殊计划？我担心这会开创先例。它的理由是，去**贴现窗口**（Discount Window）会带来耻辱感。最终，我们看到一些金融机构通过利用该计划进行套利，即提取资金但又赚取准备金利息。我认为我们必须非常小心，当美联储参与大量救助计划时，因为它向市场发出了一个信号，即他们下次也可以期待这种救助。作为监管机构，有很多人这样说，而且你对为加密货币公司提供银行服务的公司进行了高度审查，其中许多公司声称受到了不公平待遇。从高层次来看，让我们从这里开始。从高层次来看，如果一家银行试图在加密货币公司中建立业务，会出现什么问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">draw funds from the Federal Reserve. I think there were a lot of us who raised our eyebrows at this. If the banks already had access to the discount window, why did they need this special program? I worried about the precedent setting of this. It was justified on the basis that there is stigma of going to the discount window. Ultimately, we saw some financial institutions game and arbitrage the program by drawing on it but then earning interest on reserves. I think we just have to be really careful when the Fed engages in lots of bailout programs because it sends a signal to the market that they can expect it the next time around. as a regulator and there are many people who say this and I you had a high level of scrutiny towards companies that banked crypto companies and many of them claimed that they were treated unfairly. What is it just from a high level? Let's start there. From a high level, what issues emerge when if any issues emerge from a bank that tries to build up a business among crypto companies?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我认为这有点像阴谋论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this is a bit of a conspiracy theory.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的。不，你看，我只是从监管角度。好吧，继续。因为事实是，**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）的问题，正如你所知并早些时候描述的那样，实际上是他们的国债证券严重亏损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, look, I'm but I'm just from a regulatory pers. Okay, go on. Because the truth is is that the issues with Silicon Valley Bank as you know and and described earlier was really about being so deeply underwater on their treasury securities.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 但无论是**Signature Bank**，它确实有相当大的加密货币业务，但你也会听到所有这些加密货币公司说：“哦，我们没有，我们很难找到银行账户。”他们进行银行业务真的很难吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there's whether we're talking about Signature Bank which did have a pretty big crypto book but also you just get all these crypto companies like oh we don't have it's so difficult for us to find a bank account. Is it difficult for them to do banking?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 是的。那么让我们看看我们所说的加密货币贷款的银行业务是什么意思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So let's see what we mean about banking for for crypto lending.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 当然，有些银行会觉得他们在这方面没有专业知识。我认为真正有趣的问题是关于存款业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Certainly there are going to be some banks who feel they have no expertise in this. I think the really interesting question is about deposit taking.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的，当然。我不是在谈论加密货币，我是在谈论从加密原生或加密货币公司那里吸收存款。吸收存款。当涉及到吸收大量进出频繁的存款时，银行总是会关注一系列问题。其中大部分与他们自己的反洗钱义务以及之前提到的存款集中度有关。所以当你的银行有几个储户占据了你存款基础的绝大多数时，你显然会采取一些措施来小心谨慎。我想说，这次挤兑中的加密货币问题相当轻微。它实际上是关于我们通过市场看到的潜在风险的感知。尽管我觉得几天之内，焦点又回到了未受保存款上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, definitely. I'm not talking about crypto. I'm talking about the deposit taking from cryptonative or crypto companies. deposit taking. There are a set of issues that banks always are going to want to look at when it comes to taking very very large deposits with a lot of in-n-out activity. And much of that is related to their own obligations for money laundering as well as what was mentioned before deposit concentration. So when you are a bank that has a couple of depositors who are the super majority of your deposit base, you are obviously going to take some steps to be careful around that. And I would say that the crypto issues in this run were fairly muted. It was really the perception about the potential exposures that we saw through the market. Though I feel that within a few days the fixation again was on uninsured deposits.</p>

### 美联储的双重目标与监管文化

**Tracy Aloway:** 谈到债券亏损，我觉得美联储处于一个两难境地，因为一方面它必须执行货币政策。如果通货膨胀很高，它就必须提高基准利率。但另一方面，它也有金融稳定使命。这不属于双重使命的一部分，但它是一个监管机构。在这种情况下提高利率似乎引发了银行挤兑。美联储应该如何平衡这两个目标？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When it comes to the bond losses, it strikes me that the Fed is kind of in a difficult position because on the one hand it has to conduct monetary policy. If inflation is high, it has to raise benchmark rates. But on the other hand, it also has a financial stability mandate. It's not part of the dual mandate, but it is a regulator. and raising interest rates in this case sparked a bank run it seems. How is the Fed supposed to balance these two goals?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我根本不认为这是一种平衡。好的。我认为**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve）在许多涉及金融稳定的情况下，包括**雷曼兄弟**（Lehman Brothers）事件，甚至包括新冠疫情期间，都错过了很多。但这次肯定是一个更清晰的联系，当你拥有高度集中的债券投资组合处于亏损状态时，你需要格外小心，确保它们没有资本不足，缺乏流动性，坦率地说，当你监管该机构时，你没有视而不见。**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）的警告信号已经存在了好几个月。我确实认为，在危机爆发前的几年里，联邦储备委员会存在一种“轻触式”监管文化，我认为这已被证明是代价高昂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't see that as a balance at all. Okay. I think there is a lot that the Federal Reserve has really missed the in in many of the situations involving financial stability around Lehman Brothers as well as even including COVID. But certainly this one was a more clear linkage where when you have high concentrations of bond portfolios that are underwater, you need to be extra careful to not make sure that they are under capitalized, that they lack liquidity, and frankly that you are not turning a blind eye when you are supervising that institution. The warning signs with Silicon Valley Bank were there for months. And I do think there was a bit of a culture at the Federal Reserve of really taking a light touch in the years leading up to the crisis that I think has proven to be costly.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我想回到加密货币，因为我不想仅仅谈论银行在反洗钱、大量进出交易等方面的义务。然而，从监管角度来看，那些建立了加密货币业务的银行是否受到了额外的审查？或者说，这是否值得额外的审查？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to go back to crypto because I want to talk not just I understand the the obligations that a bank has in terms of money laundering in terms of lots of in-n-out transactions etc. However, from a regulatory perspective were banks that built up a crypto book of business did they get extra scrutiny in some way or did they does that merit extra scrutiny?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我认为你总是希望确保规则尽可能清晰。而且我确实认为银行监管已经变成了一套非常混乱的规则。坦率地说，我认为是为了适应最大的参与者，而不是简单的明确规则。当涉及到新型活动时，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you always want to make sure that rules are as clear as possible. And I do think bank regulation has turned into really a messy set of rules. Frankly, I think to accommodate the largest players rather than simple bright line rules. with when it comes to new types of activities,</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 毫无疑问，新颖的活动需要比方说直接的抵押贷款或直接的小企业贷款更多的关注。所以，当你有一家银行，特别是它在某种产品上没有经验，而这种产品可能给它们带来一些真正的风险时，我认为银行监管机构进行“踢轮胎”（kick the tires: 仔细检查）并不是不合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's no question that novel activities are going to need a little bit more look than say a straightforward mortgage or a straightforward small business loan.

**Tracy Aloway:** 具体来说，“踢轮胎”是什么样子？

**Roit Chopra:** 始终是首要任务。但你知道，银行在美国的金融治理中扮演着重要角色，而储备货币的一大原因和好处是其在侦测和阻止恐怖主义融资、贩毒集团等方面发挥的作用。联邦法律对此施加了一些真正的义务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">is always the top priority. But of you know banks play a major role in the financial state craft of America and one of the big reasons and benefits of the reserve currency is the role in detecting and deterring terrorism, finance, drug cartels, and more. and federal law puts some real obligations on them for that.</p>

### 金融科技与支付的未来

**Tracy Aloway:** 好的。那么，谈到新颖的业务，我想稍微扩大一下范围，也许谈谈金融科技以及银行现在正在做什么。在这里我必须声明一下，我对金融科技总体上非常厌倦。我以前在《**金融时报**》（FT）报道过它，我一遍又一遍地听到同样的故事，同样的主题，比如“大科技公司要来抢银行的生意了”，或者“零售业要来抢银行的生意了”，比如沃尔玛开始推出金融产品之类的。快进到今天，我的意思是，这似乎确实正在发生。在支付领域，最终的目标是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, speaking of novel businesses, I want to widen the net a little bit and maybe talk about fintech and what banks are doing right now. And here I have to issue a disclaimer which is I am very jaded about fintech in general. I used to cover it at the FT and I heard the same stories, the same themes over and over again like big tech is coming for the banks or retail is coming for the banks like Walmart start starting a financial product and things like that. Fast forward to today, I mean it does seem like this is something that is actually happening. What's the ultimate ambition there in the payment space? Well, payments is really something that has so rapidly changed. Many of it is very good. It's easier to移动 money, particularly with mobile devices. It's faster than it used to be. I do think that we have some real concerns about the playbook that many of the firms who are moving money, how are they monetizing it? A lot of our payments companies and big tech companies I think are really drooling over what they see in China where Alip pay and WeChat pay are trafficking almost all of the consumer payments non-cash payments in</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 支付确实是变化非常迅速的领域。其中很多变化都非常好。移动资金变得更容易，特别是通过移动设备。它比以前更快了。我确实认为我们对许多移动资金的公司所采用的策略有一些真正的担忧，他们是如何通过它赚钱的？我认为我们很多支付公司和大型科技公司都在垂涎中国市场，在那里**支付宝**（Alipay）和**微信支付**（WeChat Pay）几乎垄断了所有的消费者非现金支付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can't pay in cash at a Starbucks in Beijing. I know from personal experience</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 而且我们对那里的货币化方案有很多疑问。当我在**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）时，我们主导了一项研究，调查了所有这些主要的支付平台。我认为有一种渴望通过监控来将这些支付信息货币化，能够准确地知道一个人支付的金额，以及他们购物篮中商品级别的详细数据，最终喂养一个基础算法，该算法最终可以提供个性化价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we there's a lot of questions about what is the monetization scheme there. When I was at the CFPB, we led a study that looked at all of these major payment platforms. And I think there was a desire to monetize a lot of that payments information through surveillance, being able to know exactly not just the amount someone is paying, but the skew level data in their basket, ultimately feeding a foundational algorithm that ultimately could serve up personalized prices.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 我们处理了很多关于欺诈和身份盗窃的问题。当然，也存在资金存储地点转移的问题。许多人认为他们用来汇款的应用程序将钱存放在某个银行账户中，但实际上可能存放在一个未受保的账户中。所以我认为我们应该从这些公司的目标以及他们为什么想要支付的角度来看待支付。我们与全球中央银行和监管机构努力合作，注入更多竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was lots of issues we dealt with when it comes to fraud and identity theft. There were certainly issues when it comes to the shift of where money was being stored. Many people believed that the app they were using to send money had money in a bank account somewhere but in fact maybe it was in an uninsured account. So I think that we should be looking at payments in terms of what is the ambitions of those companies and why do they want it. We worked hard with global central banks and regulators to inject more competition.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 例如，苹果公司对iOS设备拥有真正的垄断，只允许使用**Apple Pay**。欧洲已经禁止了这种做法。其他国家也在寻求限制它。所以我认为**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种旨在保持价格稳定的加密货币），一旦稳定币成为更广泛生态系统的一部分，它可能会带来一些关于美国支付最终如何运作的额外问题。

<p class="english-text">Apple for example had a real chokeold over iOS devices only allowing Apple Pay to be used. Europe has banned that practice. other countries are looking to restrict it as well.

Yeah, I was just</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的，我刚才正想问这个问题，因为在某种程度上，如果我担心少数互联网巨头和少数商业巨头想要获得越来越多关于我自己和我的购物的详细数据，那么这似乎是一件潜在的好事。在我看来，**稳定币**（Stablecoin）以及在手机上拥有自己的分布式钱包之类的东西，可能会改变互联网的架构，从而消除那种只有少数几家巨头公司才能访问的信息瓶颈。

**Roit Chopra:** 是的，这取决于谁发行它们。好的。当我在**联邦贸易委员会**（Federal Trade Commission）时，**马克·扎克伯格**（Mark Zuckerberg）、**谢丽尔·桑德伯格**（Sheryl Sandberg）和其他人

**Roit Chopra:** 宣布了**Libra项目**，我认为这完全是为了巩固Facebook（现在的Meta）帝国在追踪资金流向方面的护城河，并最终确保在其生态系统中运营的商家会使用他们选择的货币。所以我认为，我们不应该让支付和货币被任何真正的商业巨头控制，这一点非常重要。如果有一个完全独立发行且不隶属于这些公司之一的**稳定币**（Stablecoin），那当然可以，但我担心市场很容易倾向于现有的某个大型科技网络，最终这可能会给那家公司带来巨大的优势，但对整个经济不一定有利。特蕾西，你知道对我来说有趣的是，有很多加密货币人士，他们中的很多人对Libra再次感到非常不满，以及整个项目是如何失败的。但在我看来，如果你仔细想想，许多同样的科技人士讨厌2020年代初和2010年代末大型社交网络上存在的言论监管，以及“影子禁令”之类的东西。这就像，想象一下如果他们对支付也这样做，对吧？你真的想把他们决定什么是适当言论和什么是不适当言论的权力，也投入到“现在他们也有能力监管什么是适当支付和不适当支付”的领域吗？这赋予了他们巨大的权力。

<p class="english-text">announced the Libra project, which I think was completely a way to cement more of a moat of Facebook and and now Meta's empire of being able to track and trace the flow of money and ultimately to be able to ensure that merchants operating in their ecosystem would use their currency of choice. So I think it's really important that we do not have payments and money controlled by any real big commercial player. it is if it if there is a stable coin that is issued completely separately that is not affiliated with one of those companies but I worry that the market could easily tip toward an existing big tech network and ultimately that might provide huge advantages to that firm but not necessarily the whole economy. Tracy, you know what's funny to me is, you know, you have all the crypto people and there a lot of them got really upset about Libra again and how that thing whole failed. But to my mind, if you think about it, many of those same tech people hated the speech regulations that existed on the big social networks in the early 2020s and the late 10s and the idea of shadow banning and all of this stuff. And it's like, imagine if they did that to payments, right? Like do you really want to invest that same power that they have to decide what is appropriate speech and not appropriate speech into the realm of okay now they also have the ability to regulate what is appropriate payments and inappropriate payments. That's a lot of investature of power.</p>

**Tracy Aloway:** 这就是英国出现的问题，对吧？当时已经有一些关于**奈杰尔·法拉奇**（Nigel Farage）的银行账户因其政治立场而被取消的争议。所以，是的，这种担忧确实存在。

**Roit Chopra:** 我们这里也发生过类似的事情，**PayPal**发出了一些条款和条件，允许PayPal对人们在平台外的言论进行罚款。我认为我们需要非常小心，不要赋予这些公司在言论或商业方面拥有巨大影响力的能力。这也是大多数发达国家将银行业和商业分离的部分原因。但我们现在可能正处于一个新时代。我会说**稳定币**（Stablecoin）实际上与加密货币无关。它可能确实是技术，但它本质上是一种新型的支付和银行特许。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we had that here where PayPal had sent out some terms and conditions that allowed PayPal to find people for their speech presumably off platform. And I think we need to be really careful about giving any of those firms the ability to really have a big footprint either on speech or on commerce. And that is part of the reason why most developed countries have separated banking and commerce. But we are now potentially in a new era. And I would argue stable coin is not really about crypto. That might certainly be the technology, but it is essentially a new type of payments and banking charter.</p>
</details>

### 稳定币：银行存款还是货币市场基金？

**Tracy Aloway:** 等等，多谈谈这个，因为大多数人想到**稳定币**（Stablecoin）时，可能想到的是**货币市场基金**（Money Market Funds: 投资于短期、低风险债务工具的共同基金），但正如你指出的，它与银行业有很大的重叠，因为稳定币发行方吸收人们的资金，并且在大多数情况下，据称将其投资于美国国债、也许是黄金等超安全资产。整个业务建立在储户总是能拿回资金的前提上。对吧。这听起来就像银行的回声。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, talk more about that because most people when they think of stable coins, they probably think of a money market fund, but as you point out, there's a huge overlap with banking in the sense that stable coin issuers are taking in people's money and for the most part supposedly putting it into things like US treasuries, maybe gold, ultra safe assets. And the whole business is built on the premise that depositors are always going to get their money back. Right. That seems like an echo of a bank.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 没错。我认为随着时间的推移，我们已经看到了银行与其他类型的存款工具之间的界限变得模糊。你知道，**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve）多次需要稳定**货币市场基金**（Money Market Funds），事实上，纽约联邦储备银行有一个工具，即隔夜逆回购计划，可以被认为是某种日常救助计划，以保持其稳定并传导货币政策。我真的担心，如果我们继续看到大量资金从银行流向这些货币基金，我们实质上将会在我们如何向实体经济传导和中介信贷方面制造问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And I think over time we have seen how the line has blurred between a bank and other types of deposit instruments. You know, essentially the Federal Reserve has multiple times needed to stabilize money market funds and in fact has a facility at the New York Federal Reserve, the overnight reverse repo program that one could consider a sort of daily bailout program to keep it stable and transmit monetary policy. I really worry that if we keep having enormous flows from banks to these money funds, we are essentially going to create problems with how we transmit and intermediate credit to the real economy.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would argue that a stable coin, if it was a tokenized bank deposit</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 而不是**代币化**（Tokenization）的**货币市场基金**（Money Market Funds），从长远来看会有很多不同的影响。我们大多数人都知道，银行仍然是向小企业、农场和实体经济提供贷款的关键。如果你实质上是在偏向货币市场基金或代币化货币市场基金，那么受益者将是非常大的公司、主权国家以及其他可以进入这些货币市场的人。所以我们真的应该确保银行，或者有某种东西能够填补小企业、农民以及其他依赖银行信贷的人的空白。

<details>

<p class="english-text">versus a tokenized money market fund, has a lot of different effects long term. Most of us know that banks are still the key to lend to small businesses, to lend to farms, and to lend to the real economy. If you are essentially putting a thumb on the scale toward money market funds or tokenized money market funds, the beneficiaries are very large firms, sovereigns, and others who can access those money markets. So we should really want to make sure that banks or there is some something that takes the place of filling in the gap for small businesses, farmers and others who depend on bank credit.</p>

**Tracy Aloway:** 参议院在六月通过了《天才法案》（Genius Act），旨在开始制定一套更健全的**稳定币**（Stablecoin）法规，但它不允许发行有收益的稳定币。所以如果你从事稳定币业务，那是一项很棒的业务。你可以收取所有这些收益，但你不需要像银行那样将其转嫁给客户。你对此有何看法？这是否是为了维护吸收存款的银行机构的重要性，以免它们以这种方式被“去中介化”，或者这只是为了安抚银行，让普通的旧存款仍然是一项好生意？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the Senate in June passed the Genius Act to, you know, start creating a more robust set of stable coin regulations, but it did not allow for yieldbearing stable coins. So that's a great business if you're in the stable coin business. Collect all that yield, but you don't have to pass it on unlike a bank. What's your perspective on that? Is this about preserving the importance of deposit taking bank institutions so that they're not dismediated into this way or is this just a sop to the banks so that normal old deposits are still a good business?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 这是一项非常混乱的立法。我认为有一些论点认为，追逐未受保产品的收益可能会导致更多的救助和更多的混乱。另一方面，我们不能制定联邦法律来偏袒银行。嗯，他们无论如何通常都能得到他们想要的。我会说，追求一些可能**去中介化**（disintermediate: 消除中间环节）现有支付网络的**代币化**（Tokenization）支付系统的最佳方式之一是使用代币化的银行存款。就像我们可以拥有纸质现金一样，每张都由不同的区域性联邦储备银行发行，我们的数字钱包可以托管全国各地银行中的代币化银行存款，并将其**中介化**（intermediated: 作为中介）为实体经济提供信贷。我认为我们看到的是一个主要有利于大型加密货币现有参与者的立法框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a very messy piece of legislation. I think there is some arguments that yield chasing of a uninsured product is probably a recipe for more bailouts and more mess. On the other hand, we can't be setting federal laws to advantage banks. Um, they often get what they want anyway. I would argue that one of the best ways to pursue some tokenized payment systems that could potentially disintermediate the incumbent payment networks would be to use tokenized bank deposits. And just like we could have paper cash, each issued by a different regional Federal Reserve Bank, our digital wallets could host tokenized bank deposits that are sitting in banks across the country and being intermediated into credit to the real economy. I think what we see is largely a legislative framework that is going to benefit the big crypto incumbents.</p>
</details>

### 银行整合与“大而不倒”问题

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，说到惠及大公司，银行系统的另一个较大趋势当然是整合。金融危机之后，我认为我们看到小型银行、区域性银行的数量绝对暴跌。而且我认为，我们实际上花了几年时间才建立了一家新银行，一家从零开始的银行。而且我认为，它在宾夕法尼亚州的阿米什人聚居区，这有点好笑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speaking of benefiting the big, another largeish trend in the banking system is consolidation, of course. And post the financial crisis, I think we saw the number of small banks, regional banks out there absolutely plunge. And I think it took a few years before we actually got a new bank set up, a denovo bank. And it was, I think, in Pennsylvania, Amish country, which was kind of funny.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我想我的问题是，你大概希望有一个多元化的贷款机构网络，因为你想避免“大而不倒”的问题，而且你想让人们能够获得信贷，正如你之前所说。你如何鼓励一个更加多元化或动态的银行系统，并避免我们总是喜欢展示摩根大通或富国银行如何通过吞并大量公司而形成的图表那样的结果？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess my question is like presumably you want a diverse network of lenders out there because you want to avoid the too big to fail problem and you want people to have access to credit to your point earlier. How do you encourage a more diverse or dynamic banking system and avoid the outcome where, you know, Joe and I always like to throw up the charts of how JP Morgan or Wells Fargo came into being and it's just a story of them snapping up lots and lots of companies.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 几十年前，最高法院有一个非常有先见之明的案例，警告说银行系统的整合最终将导致实体经济的大规模整合。你说得对，小型社区银行的数量已经减少了。这有很多原因，包括不断变化的技术、消费者偏好等等。但我认为一个真正重要的原因是，人们普遍认为最大的银行会受到保护，正如你所提到的。当**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）倒闭时，所有资金都流向了哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Decades ago, there was a Supreme Court case that was very preient that warned that consolidation in the banking system would ultimately contribute to mass consolidation in the real economy. And you're right, the number of small community banks has dwindled. And there's all sorts of reasons for this, including changing technology, consumer preferences so much more. But I think one of the real big reasons is that there is a perception that the very largest banks as you mentioned will be protected. When Silicon Valley Bank was failing, where was all the money flowing to?</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 他们把钱从**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）、**Signature Bank**和其他银行取出来。它流向了那些大银行，因为每个投资者都相信这些银行本质上总是会受到保护。他们能够以这种隐含的担保筹集资金，这意味着他们能够在许多方面不公平地超越他们的较小同行。所以我真的认为我们需要小心，不要给予优惠并选择赢家和输家，而我们一直在做的就是基本上选择最大的银行作为赢家，其他银行作为输家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They were taking their money out of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and others. It went to the very big guys because every investor believes that these banks are essentially always going to be protected. They are able to raise money with that implicit guarantee and that means they are able to out compete on so many dimensions unfairly I think their smaller counterparts. So I I really think we need to be careful about giving benefits and picking winners and losers and that's what we have been doing is essentially picking the very largest banks as the winners and others as the losers.</p>
</details>

### 技术爆炸与监管滞后

**Tracy Aloway:** 我们最近邀请了**Robinhood**的首席执行官参加播客。他们对各种事物的**代币化**（Tokenization）非常兴奋，包括股票的代币化。而且由于某种加密技术，在定义监管范围的地理边界方面非常困难。而且由于智能合约和**稳定币**（Stablecoin）等，你很有可能在世界某个地方，也许在离岸或监管宽松的国家，创建某种追踪受监管工具的代币，它像受监管工具一样交易，直到可能出现问题。是否存在这样一种危险，即监管面向消费者的金融产品时，法律将无法跟上？是否存在这种技术爆炸，在某种程度上，任何拥有稳定币钱包和互联网访问权限的人都可以理论上在任何地方交易任何东西，这将从监管角度来看是一场危机，并且难以掌控一切？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We recently had the Robin Hood CEO on the podcast. They're very excited about tokenization of all kinds of things including uh tokenization of stock for that matter. And due to uh crypto technology of some sorts, there's enforcing borders in terms of defining what a regulatory perimeter even is from a geographical standpoint is really hard. And due to smart contracts and stable coins, etc., It's very plausible that you could somewhere in the world, maybe in an offshore or a lightly regulated country, create some token that tracks some regulated instrument and it trades like a regulated instrument up until maybe something goes bust. Is there a danger that regulating consumerf facing financial products that law won't be able to keep up? that there is this sort of like technological explosion of things and that to some extent because anyone who has access to a stable coin wallet and access to the internet could theoretically trade anything anywhere that it would just be a crisis from the regulatory perspective and keeping a handle on everything that's going on.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，我认为我们现在在美元的未来问题上处于一个“跳球”状态。我们确实看到特朗普政府非常感兴趣，我认为他们正在从根本上重新思考美元在系统中的作用。你提到了技术这个例子，但多年来我们已经看到了一个我相信是14万亿美元的离岸美元（欧洲美元）市场，这给整个监管机构带来了非常严重和重大的问题。现在我们可能会有欧洲股票，字面上不是欧洲股票指数，而是某种在交易上类似于美国上市受监管股票的东西，只是它在一个数字交易所。它是一个去中心化交易所，但它的运作方式是相同的，你甚至如何开始理解它？我认为你想要的方式是不断地弄清楚我们如何解决经济中的实际问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think we do have a jump ball right now on the future of the dollar. We do see the Trump administration very interested I think in fundamentally rethinking the role of the dollar in the system. You raise this example of technology but for years we have seen I believe it's a $14 trillion market of offshore dollars euro dollars which poses very serious and significant issues for the entire regulator. Now we could have euro stocks like literally not the Euro stocks index but something that resembles in trading a US listed regulated stock except it's on some digital exchange. It's a decentralized exchange but it moves in the same way and how do you even like begin to wrap your head around? I think the way in which you want to is constantly to figure out how do we solve real problems in the economy</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 以及你如何为此进行建设，而不是允许产品和服务纯粹基于套利来创造它。我还认为我们希望确保我们不会试图创造出如此复杂的东西，以至于它总是会被套利，我们需要更多简单的明确界限，让投资者、消费者、每个人都能真正轻松理解和遵循。

<p class="english-text">and how do you build for that rather than allowing for products services to create it purely based on arbitrage. I also think we want to make sure that we don't try and create something so complex that it will always be arbitrageed around and we need a lot more simple bright lines that investors, consumers, everyone can really easily understand and easily follow.</p>

**Roit Chopra:** 最终，美国将成为人们想要做生意的地方，因为这里有健全的法治和良好的法律体系以及所有这些东西。这是最重要的事情之一，需要加以保护。谈到新颖的业务，我想政策总是追逐新技术，我只是想用**宋飞**（Seinfeld）的方式来问这个问题：“先买后付”（Buy Now Pay Later）到底是怎么回事？因为它现在无处不在，显然

### “先买后付”（BNPL）的兴起与监管盲区

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，这总是很有趣。**联邦储备委员会**（Federal Reserve）发布了一张关于未偿消费者信贷的表格，它总是缺少很多东西，包括我们看到在大流行期间激增超过10倍的**先买后付**（Buy Now Pay Later: BNPL）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a table published by the Federal Reserve about consumer credit outstanding and it is always missing many things including buy now pay later which we have seen surge through the pandemic growing more than 10x.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 它的变化确实很大。特蕾西，**先买后付**（BNPL）奇怪的是并非源自美国本土。它来自其他司法管辖区。它在瑞典、澳大利亚很受欢迎，现在它是一种主要的信贷形式。只是为了让大家明白它是什么，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has really changed quite a bit. Tracy by now pay later strangely was not really homegrown in America. It came from other jurisdictions. It was popular in Sweden, Australia, and now it is a major form of credit. Just so everyone understands what it is,</p>
</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 你借一笔贷款，通常分四期支付。它没有利息，但**先买后付**（BNPL）的贷款人会从商家那里收取佣金，就像信用卡公司一样。所以你看到很多消费者认为这是一种更好的方式，因为它没有利息。但**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）

<p class="english-text">you take out a loan, often pay in for.

**Roit Chopra:** 对此进行了广泛研究，发现当涉及到人们退货但没有得到相应退款时，存在非常严重的问题。

<p class="english-text">did extensive study on it and found that there's very significant issues when it comes to people returning goods and not necessarily getting it credited.</p>

**Roit Chopra:** 存在人们在不同贷款机构拥有多笔**先买后付**（BNPL）贷款并过度杠杆化的问题。我实际上会听到汽车贷款机构抱怨，他们会告诉我：“如果我不知道这些**先买后付**（BNPL）贷款是什么，我怎么能批这笔汽车贷款呢？”因为它们没有出现在信用报告上。通常情况下，

<details>

Because they're not on the credit report. Often</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 这让我觉得非常有趣。我的意思是，我们目前的追踪是多么不足，无论是从规模上来看，当我们考虑“我们想对消费者负债有一个总体的了解”时，还是对于实际贷款人来说，由于缺乏对**先买后付**（BNPL）的了解，他们判断消费者信用worthiness是多么困难。

**Roit Chopra:** **先买后付**（BNPL）增长越快，问题就越困难。我认为一个关键点是，我们看到各种各样的**先买后付**（BNPL）产品超出了传统贷款机构的范围。我们看到银行和信用卡公司说：“使用我的卡，然后上网，你可以把它转换成**先买后付**（BNPL）。”或者有些人正在考虑如何

**Roit Chopra:** 将其连接到社区银行借记卡。所以我确实认为这是目前消费者未偿信贷的一个巨大盲点。显然，它在整体无担保债务中占比较小，但如果它继续保持其发展轨迹，即使增长放缓，它也将成为这块蛋糕中的一大块。

</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我的意思是，**先买后付**（BNPL）大概会或可能属于**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）的职权范围，但是

<details>

**Roit Chopra:** 嗯，我们看到的是，**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）试图为**先买后付**（BNPL）借款人设置的一些基本保护措施，比如你可以获得一些声明，说明你可以退货并获得退款。

</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 看起来很多都被扔进了垃圾桶，或者根本没有得到执行。不过，我们看到全国各州都在寻求加强保护措施，因为他们看到这可能会给人们造成债务的“跑步机效应”。我还有一个问题。你在拜登政府时期担任**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）局长，在特朗普第一届政府时期担任**联邦贸易委员会**（FTC）委员，并且经历了特朗普第二届政府的一些时期。你对特朗普1.0和特朗普2.0之间的区别，以及该政府如何运作和思考监管等问题有何看法？

<p class="english-text">It looks like a lot of that is just being thrown in the trash or just not enforced. We are seeing states all over the country though looking to beef up protections because they see how this could create a treadmill of debt for people. Just one more question from me. So you were head of the CFPB under the Biden administration and you were at the FTC under the first Trump administration and you got to experience some some of the second Trump administration. What's your sense of the difference between Trump 1 and Trump 2.0 and how that administration is operating and thinking about things like regulation?</p>

### 特朗普政府的金融监管思路

**Roit Chopra:** 是的，我认为当涉及到金融时，人们确实对他们如何看待美元以及他们如何看待国债的未来感到担忧。我看到**贝森**（Besson）部长非常谨慎地谈论希望**稳定币**（Stablecoin）例如，成为提振国债需求的一种方式。当然，这有很多问题，

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that there is when it comes to finance a real sense of concern about how they want to think about the dollar and how they want to think of the future of Treasury securities.

</details>

**Roit Chopra:** 但我认为更广泛地说，特朗普第一届政府的组织性要差得多，而现在显然有一个他们正在执行的计划，即使它看起来很混乱。所以我认为对于那些对此有担忧的人，我不认为他们应该将其归结为仅仅是混乱或疯狂。我认为正在做的很多事情将对金融系统产生持久影响。

**Tracy Aloway:** 现在金融监管领域正在发生很多有趣的事情。只是，你知道，拨动表盘，我认为这是一个非常宏观的故事，但它没有得到太多关注，因为我们非常关注政府的更迭，因为金融危机是很久以前的事情了，这些事情总是潮起潮落，对吧？所以你经历了一场危机，每个人都严厉打击，然后你，你知道，你做到了极致，然后记忆消退，你会想：“我们为什么要这样？”我觉得这是人类的天性，随着2009-2010年的改革越来越远，我们只会经历这种自然的放松，直到2045年或任何时候的金融危机。

<p class="english-text">There's so many interesting things happening in FinReneg right now in general. just obviously the sort of like turning of the dial you know I think like a really big picture story that doesn't get a lot of attention because we focus a lot on the changing administrations because the financial crisis was a really long time ago these things always eb and flow right so you have a crisis and everyone cracks down and you sort of uh you know you do the max and then memories fade you're like why do we have the like this is I feel like it's human nature as the 2009200 reforms go further into the past, we're just going to have this sort of natural loosening until the financial crisis of 2045 or whatever it is.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我的意思是，我们为什么要设立**消费者金融保护局**（CFPB）？整个答案是它是在2008年金融危机之后创建的。我认为另一件非常有趣的事情，这涉及到整合点，我认为这是美国金融业的一个巨大故事，但它只是那个想法，好吧，如果你担心你在一家小型银行的存款，自然而然的做法是将其转移到一家“大而不倒”的银行，因为你知道美国政府根据先例是不会让它们倒闭的，所以这似乎又给了大银行一种不自然的优势，也许在存款方面。我的意思是，我知道我们在SVB事件之后的多期节目中讨论过这个问题，但美国仍然存在的银行数量之多令人难以置信，对吧？世界上没有其他国家有这么多银行。加拿大只有六家银行。我们这个国家的银行密度如此之高。直到今天，随机的
