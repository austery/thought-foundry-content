### 电影精神的传承

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这本书的精神对我来说很难把握。它带给我很多感受，很多触动。但您会说，您成功地将何种内在精神融入到了电影中呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: The spirit of the book is it's hard for me. It's hard to grab on to. I think lots of feelings, lots of things that made me feel. But what would you say was the the inherent spirit that you were able to transfer over to the film?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，我想如果我试图用一两句话来概括，那我会毁了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh, I I think I would kill it if I tried to put it into into like a sentence or two here.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 人的生命，某种东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: The life of man. Something something.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 没错，是的，就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Exactly. Yeah. Exactly.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我是**吉尔伯特·克鲁兹**，这里是《**纽约时报书评**》，现在是奥斯卡季。我一生都热爱奥斯卡。今年我已经看了10部最佳影片提名中的8部。在上一集中，我有幸与**吉尔莫·德尔·托罗**谈论了他改编**玛丽·雪莱**的《**弗兰肯斯坦**》。今天，我们请来了另一位奥斯卡提名者，**克林特·本特利**。**克林特**是《**火车之梦**》的导演和联合编剧，这部电影改编自**丹尼斯·约翰逊**2011年同名中篇小说。两者都讲述了**罗伯特·格林尼尔**的故事。**罗伯特**是一名伐木工人，也是一名铁路工人，生活在20世纪初的太平洋西北地区。这基本上就是他的一生。他工作，坠入爱河，有了孩子，遭遇悲剧，为悲剧而悲伤。像我们所有人一样，他经历着宏大与琐碎。这本书和电影都深深打动了我，但方式截然不同。这部电影获得了四项奥斯卡提名，包括最重要的最佳影片和最佳改编剧本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm **Gilbert Cruz**. This is the book review from the **New York Times** and it's Oscar season. I love the Oscars. I've loved them my entire life. This year I've already seen eight of the 10 best picture nominees. On our last episode, I had the chance to speak with **Guillermo Del Toro** about his adaptation of **Mary Shelley**'s **Frankenstein**. And today we have another Oscar nominee on the show, **Clint Bentley**. **Clint** is the director and the co-writer of **Train Dreams**, which is a film that he adapted from the 2011 **Dennis Johnson** novella of the same name. Both tell the story of **Robert Grineer**. **Robert** is a logger. He's a rail worker. He lives in the Pacific Northwest in the early 20th century. And it's basically his life. He he works. He falls in love. He has a child. He suffers a tragedy. He grieves at tragedy. Like any of us, he experiences things both grand and trivial. And and I was moved greatly by both the book and the film, but in very different ways. And the film for its part is nominated for four Oscars, including the big one, best picture, and best adapted screenplay.

### 初遇丹尼斯·约翰逊

**Gilbert Cruz**: 所以当我与**克林特**交谈时，我们直接谈到了源头。那么，让我们从谈论**丹尼斯·约翰逊**这个人开始。当《**纽约时报**》向500位作家和其他文学界人士征集本世纪至今的伟大书籍时，那100本书中有两本是**丹尼斯·约翰逊**的作品。一本是《**烟树**》，这是一部庞大、散漫的700页著作，背景设定在越南战争期间。而光谱的另一端，则是《**火车之梦**》，这是一部短小但极其有力的书，讲述了**罗伯特·格林尼尔**的一生。您是何时第一次接触**丹尼斯·约翰逊**的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So when I talked with **Clint**, we went right to the source. So let's start by talking about the man. Let's talk about **Dennis Johnson**. When the **New York Times** pulled 500 authors and other literary figures to figure out what the great books of this century so far on, two of those 100 books were by **Dennis Johnson**. **Tree of Smoke**, which is this large, sprawling 700-page book set during the Vietnam War. And then all the way on the other end of the spectrum, you have **Train Dreams**, which is this short but extremely powerful book about this man's life, **Robert Grineer**. When did you first encounter **Dennis Johnson**?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我第一次接触他的作品实际上是通过《**火车之梦**》，就在它出版的那一年。我听说过他的名字，但从未读过任何作品。然后《**火车之梦**》在我大学毕业前后出版，我当时四处游荡，而《**火车之梦**》是那一年必读的书之一，它的大小非常适合塞进背包里。所以我在路上某个地方买下了它，然后就爱上了这本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I first encountered his writing actually through **Train Dreams** the year that it came out. I knew him by name, but I had never read anything. And then **Train Dreams** came out right around the time or right after I got out of college and I was like I was bumming around and **Train Dreams** was one of the books to read that year and it was a very like good size to slip in a backpack and so I picked it up somewhere on the road and just fell in love with the book.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那本书里有什么东西让您与它产生了共鸣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What was it in that book that that connected you to it?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我不知道。就是这个小人物的故事，以及**丹尼斯**以一种让你感受到史诗般宏大和广阔的方式来呈现它。它让我想起了很多我从小一起长大、被他们养育的人。我在佛罗里达的一个牧场家庭长大，非常工薪阶层，而**格林尼尔**和这本书里的所有人，都让我想起了我身边那些人。这本书就像活在我心里一样，多年来，我发现自己会不经意地想起不同的场景，却不知道为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I don't know. There was just something about the the story of this little life and how **Dennis** rendered it in such a way that you felt you felt the epicness and you you felt the vastness of of this small little life and it reminded me of so many of the people that I had grown up with and and been raised by. I was raised in a ranching family in Florida and very working class and **Grineer** and all the people in this book just reminded me of the of of the people I'd been raised around. The book just like kind of lived inside me and I I would find myself over the years like different scenes would pop up to the surface without really knowing why.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在您人生的那个阶段，您还是个年轻人。您第一次读这本书时，您是作家吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: At that point in your life, you're a young man. You read this book for the first time. Were you a writer?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，是的。我当时和朋友们一起拍短片，但只是为了好玩，并没有把自己看作一个会成为电影制作人的人。我以为我会成为一名小说家，并且非常努力地尝试过。我的电脑里有几部未完成的小说，它们从未面世，还有一大堆来自当时全国所有文学杂志的拒稿信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh, yeah. I was I was making short films with my friends, but just for fun and didn't think of myself as as somebody who would become a filmmaker. I thought I would be a novelist and and tried very hard to be one and have a couple of like carcasses of novels on my computer that never that never saw the light of day and a ton of rejection letters from that time from from like every literary magazine in the in the country.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您当时在写些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What were you writing about?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我犯了一个年轻作家会犯的所有错误，从我童年时期极其自传性的事情，到某个随机发生的派对，再到某种——我不好意思说——历史小说。但这对学习写作来说是一个很好的训练。您还记得《**火车之梦**》第一次阅读时，有什么特别的瞬间一直留在您脑海中吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I was making all the mistakes that that a young writer makes of writing about everything from incredibly like autobiographical things from my childhood or from some random party that happened all the way to some sort of like I I'm embarrassed to say it but like historical fiction. But it was good training in in terms of just like learning how to write. Do you recall any particular moment from the book **Train Dreams** on that first reading that really stuck with you the entire time?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的。其中一个就是他描述他们第一次约会和第一次接吻的方式，**格林尼尔**最终向**格拉迪斯**求婚。那个场景不知为何总会在我脑海中浮现，它有一种独特的美。他用了一个短语，比如“毛茛的点头”，那真是令人心碎。然后还有另一个场景，它总是让我觉得既奇怪又非常感人。当我后来重新阅读，考虑把它拍成电影时，我当时就想，我必须拍这个场景，只为了把这个场景放进去。我的联合编剧**格雷格**读到它时也说：“哦，你必须做这个。这让我想起了你。”那是**格林尼尔**还是个15岁孩子的时候，他在树林里遇到一个垂死的人，然后用自己的靴子给他水喝的场景。这些场景，我不知道，就是抓住了我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah. One was like the way that he talks about their first date and their first kiss where **Grineer** ends up proposing to **Gladys**. That would just always like bubble up in my mind for some reason. There was just such a a beauty to it. There's like a phrase that he used in there of like the nodding of the buttercups that that just was so heartbreaking. And then there's another one that like always stuck with me as as being so strange yet very very emotional. And it was the one that like when I came back around and read it again thinking about like making it into a movie, it's one of the scenes I was like I I have to make this just to put this scene in there. And it was also my co-writer **Greg** when he read it. He was like, "Oh, you need to do this. This reminds me of you." It's the one where the kid **Grineer** is a 15-year-old kid comes across this man dying in the woods and gives him a a drink of water from his own boot. Those are the scenes that I don't know just got a hold of me.

</details>

### 电影改编的挑战与哲学

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您刚才提到了您的合作者**格雷格·奎达尔**。《**火车之梦**》是您们合作的第四部电影。您们四部都是共同编剧，其中两部是您执导的。那么，您是如何得到机会来制作这部电影的呢？毕竟您在12、13年前就读过它了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You just mentioned your collaborator **Greg Kwedar**. **Train Dreams** is the fourth film that you've worked on. You've co-written all four with him. You've directed two of them. How did you get the opportunity to make this one in particular having read it, you know, 12 years ago, 13 years ago?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的，这次机会的到来方式是我从未想过的。我执导了一部由**格雷格**和我共同编剧、**格雷格**制作的电影，叫做《**赛马手**》，它去了圣丹斯电影节。我们电影的一些制片人拥有《**火车之梦**》的版权好几年了，一直在寻找一位电影制作人来制作它。他们在圣丹斯电影节看到了《**赛马手**》，我想他们真的看到了某种精神上的亲近感，或者某种艺术上的亲近感，所以就联系了我。一开始，我对这个前景非常兴奋。但后来当我回去重新阅读这本书时，我心想：“哦，也许这东西根本无法改编。”我当时非常紧张。我为此犹豫了一段时间，我知道我爱它，但不想把它搞砸，不想让这本书或**丹尼斯**失望，尽管他当时已经去世了。所以，我花了一段时间才真正投入其中，很多朋友一路都在劝我不要放弃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah, this one came in a way that I didn't think a a film project would come to me. I directed a film called **Jockey** that **Greg** and I had written together and **Greg** produced and that went to Sundance and a few of our producers on the film had had the rights to **Train Dreams** for several years and had been trying to find a filmmaker to make it and they saw **Jockey** at Sundance and I think just really saw some like kinship of spirit or or some kind of artistic kinship there and reached out. And at first I was just so excited at the prospect. And then going back and reading the book again, I was like, "Oh, maybe this thing is unadaptable." And I was very nervous about it. I went back and forth on it for a while, knowing that I loved it, but not wanting to do a bad job of it, not wanting to let the book down or **Dennis**, even though he was passed on at the time. And so it took me a minute to really like jump into it and a lot of friends talking me off ledges along the way.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 当时您觉得什么地方是无法改编的？是什么让您犹豫不决？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What at the time did you think was unadaptable? Like what was giving you pause?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 嗯，我想这要回到中篇小说本身的结构。它只有116或117页，但它却涵盖了整个人生，整个时代。这对电影来说是一个危险信号，因为如果你试图涵盖那么长的时间，电影就会变得像维基百科条目，只是一堆“然后发生了这个，然后发生了那个”。最重要的是，这本书有一种非常引人入胜的风格，它非常意识流，情节跳跃，你知道，前一句他还是个孩子，下一句他就要死了，然后又回到他看到**猫王**在火车上的场景。这一切都运作得很好。但我感觉，如果我们需要把它固定在更传统的**三幕结构**上，加上一个**激发事件**等等，那就会扼杀这本书的魔力。我真的不想那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Well, it's just I I think going back to the construction of the novella itself, it's only 116 or 117 pages and yet it is this entire life, an entire time in the world. And that is a red flag for a movie because if when you're trying to cover that much time, a movie can start to feel like a Wikipedia entry, just a bunch of like and then this happened and that happened. And then on top of that, the book has this really evocative style to it where it's it's very stream of consciousness and it just like slips all over the place, you know, and in one sentence he's a child and then the next scene he's dying and then it comes back and he's seeing **Elvis** on a train and and it all works so well. But I felt if if there were a situation where we needed to pin that down to more of a traditional three-act structure with an inciting incident and blah blah blah, you kill the magic of the book. And I really didn't want to do that.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 所以您克服了顾虑和担忧，决定改编这本书。请告诉我您是如何开始的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So you get over your concerns, your trepidation, you decide to adapt this book. Walk me through

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我只是忽略了它们。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I just ignore them. Yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嘿，我一直都这样！请告诉我您是如何开始的。您是反复阅读吗？幸运的是，这是一本相当短的书。您会撕下书页，划出场景吗？您是如何将这个故事，用一个不那么花哨的词来说，分解成可以转化为银幕的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Hey, I do it all the time. Walk me through how you start. Are you rereading and rereading? Luckily, this is a fairly short book. Are you ripping out pages, underlining scenes? Like, how do you start to sort of break this story, for lack of a a better phrase, into one that you can translate to screen?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的，我很快就发现我对这个结构有了一个大致的认识。它基本上变成了电影的前半部分，看着他来回奔波，试图调和工作在外与回家陪伴家人的矛盾。然后，火灾会在电影中部发生，将叙事一分为二。电影的最后一部分则更多是关于寻找或渴望，试图找回他失去的东西，并思考他是否能做到。这个框架给了我们足够的信心去着手。然后，**格雷格**和我各自多次阅读这本书，划出任何觉得重要的内容。我们总是从一个共享文档开始，在里面抛出任何想法。底部有一个“杂物袋”，里面是没有任何归属的随机对话台词或图像。同时，我们俩都在独立和共同进行大量研究。我阅读任何能找到的资料。那个钉在树上的靴子的画面，实际上就是我阅读一些随机的伐木历史书籍时发现的。我了解到，这是他们为那些在河上漂流原木、疏通木材堵塞的工人所做的事情。当其中一人去世时，无论在哪里找到他的尸体，他们都会把他的靴子钉在那里的树上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah, I I found pretty quickly that I I did have like a sense of this what the structure could be. And that being basically what it turned into, which is like the first half of the film, kind of watching him go back and forth between trying to reconcile being away for work and coming back home and and trying to spend time with the family. And then the fire would come in the middle of the film and just break the narrative in half. And then the last part of the film would be more of a of a of a film of searching or or longing and trying to find his way back to to something that he lost and and wondering if he could ever do that. And so that that framework gave us enough confidence to go into it. And then yeah, **Greg** and I each on our own just read the book multiple times, underlined, you know, anything that felt important. We we always start with like a a shared document that we write in that we're just throwing like any ideas, anything like that. There's like a grab bag at the bottom that's just like random lines of dialogue that don't have a home or images or or anything like that. simultaneously. There's a lot of research that we're both doing individually and together. Like reading anything I can get my hands on. The image of the the boots nailed to the tree actually is is one that came from just reading some random history of logging book and learning that that was something that they had done for the guys who would ride the logs down the rivers and would break apart log jams and when one of them died, wherever they found his body, they would nail his boots to a tree there.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那是一个引人注目的画面。非常非常引人注目，而且它变得比画面本身更宏大，这是您所希望的。但是的，我们做了很多研究。然后我们就在那个文档里，开始为每一个我们知道会出现在电影中的场景写一句话。有时这很简单，比如“**格林尼尔**回家了，很尴尬”，或者“火灾发生了”。然后我们把这些句子扩展成段落，每个段落都关于一个场景。然后我们开始反复修改场景，来回传递，不断完善，直到我们有了一个——我们总是希望它是一个更好的初稿，但实际上是一个糟糕的初稿。然后，您就可以从那里开始完善剧本了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: It's a striking image. very very striking and and became something a bit larger than than the image itself, which is what you hope for. But yeah, there's a lot of research that we're doing. And then we're just like in that document, we're starting with just like writing a sentence for every scene and that we that we know is going to be in the film. And sometimes that's as simple as just like **Grineer** comes home and it's awkward, you know, or the fire happens, you know, and then we build out each of those sentences into a paragraph. and each paragraph is about a scene. Then we start taking passes at scenes and then passing those scenes back and forth to just try and refine them along the way until we until we have a what we always hope is a better first draft than it is, but a terrible first draft. And then and then you can start refining a script from there.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这是您第一次改编小说，作为现在已经做过这件事并且看过很多根据书籍改编的电影的人，您对改编有没有一种——用一个不那么花哨的词来说——哲学？什么可以做，什么不可以做，忠实与不忠实之间的关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So, this is your first fiction adaptation and and as someone who's done it now and has seen, I presume, a lot of movies based on books, do you have, for lack of a a less fancy word, like a philosophy when it comes to adaptation, what's allowed, what's not allowed, fidelity versus lack of fidelity.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我有，这很有趣。这是我在开始这个过程时就有的想法。所以，无论它是否得到证实，或者我只是没有看任何其他证据，我不知道。但我感觉，每当一本书被改编成电影时，电影真的必须成为它自己的东西，电影制作人/编剧必须允许自己摆脱原始材料的束缚，就发生的事情而言，同时完全忠于那本书的精神。也有例外，比如《**老无所依**》就是一部改编作品，那本书本身就已经很像一部电影了，甚至在之前就写成了剧本或舞台剧。但那是我非常强烈的感觉，现在仍然如此，就是我们必须完全忠于这本书的精神和角色的精神。你不能突然把**格林尼尔**变成一个努力想要建立铁路帝国的人，那样的话，改编这本书的意义何在？但与此同时，你必须摆脱书本身的束缚，才能让电影成为它自己的作品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I do, and it's it's funny. It's it is one that I went into the process with. And so whether it was confirmed or or whether I just didn't look at any other evidence, I don't know. But I felt like whenever a book is adapted into film, the film really has to become its own thing and the filmmaker slash screenwriter has to allow themselves to be free of the source material in terms of what happens while being completely true to the spirit of that book. There there are exceptions to that like **No Country for Old Men** is an adaptation that like that book kind of already feels like a movie and was written as a screenplay or stage play before that. But that was the thing I I I felt very strongly and I still do with this one that like we had to be completely true to the spirit of the book and the spirit of the character. and you you can't all of a sudden make **Grineer** this like striving guy who wants to like create a a railroad empire or something like that, then you're then you're what's the point of making this book? But at the same time, you have to free yourself from the book itself in order to let the film become its own piece of work.

</details>

### 创作选择与情感表达

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么，您谈到了您第一次阅读时印象深刻的几个场景。除了精神之外，您还想在基调、角色瞬间、图像方面传递什么？因为对我来说，阅读一本书，观看一部电影，无论顺序如何，总是很吸引人，会说：“哦，是的，我记得书里有这个，但它感觉不同，或者看起来不同，但它仍然在那里。”您最兴奋的是从一种形式中提取什么并转移到另一种形式中？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So, you talked about a couple of scenes that stuck with you when you first read it. What else did you want to spirit it aside? What else did you want to sort of transfer over in terms of tone, character moments, in terms of images? Because it's always fascinating to me to read a book, watch a movie, whatever order it's in to sort of say, "Oh, this yeah, I remember this from the book, but it feels different or it looks different, but it's still there." What What were you most excited about taking from one form and and moving over?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我认为最重要的是一种感觉，就是世界固有的奇特之处。我认为我们生活在现代社会，在这个城市或郊区，或任何地方，生活感觉非常安全和可预测。当你走出那个范围，你会很快被提醒，情况并非如此。我想要传达的一点是，世界本身是多么奇特、美妙，甚至有点魔幻，而无需任何修饰。这并不总是以一种甜蜜可爱的方式呈现。有时它以一种非常危险和黑暗的方式呈现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I the the biggest thing was more a feeling like the strangeness the inherent strangeness of the world that I think we living in like modern society in this city or in the suburbs or wherever life feels very safe and feels very predictable and you get outside of that and and you're reminded very quickly that it is not the case. That was one thing I wanted to get across is like how strange and wonderful and kind of magical the world itself is without embellishing anything. And that's not always in like a sweet cute way. Sometimes that's in a a very dangerous and and dark way.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Mhm.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 另外一点是关于时间这个方面，就是你可能会经历漫长的一年，觉得它永远不会结束。但有时你抬头一看，会想，过去五年去哪儿了？我们很少在当下真正理解自己的生活。我们只有在为时已晚时才开始理解它们。所以，有很多这样的东西。我感觉**罗伯特·格林尼尔**这个人非常特别，他只是一个普通人，努力过着体面的生活，为家人赚钱，为自己和家人建立一个小小的生活，我觉得这非常特别，而且非常史诗般，而无需把它变成它不是的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: And then the other thing is like this aspect of time and just the way that you can have a year that just drags by and you're like this is never going to end. And then sometimes you look up and and you're like, where did the last 5 years go? We very rarely have an understanding of our lives in the moment we're actually living them. We only start to understand them when it's too late. And yeah, so there there's a lot of that. And I felt like there was something very special about **Robert Grineer** in terms of taking this person who's just an average everyday person who is just trying to lead a decent life and trying to make some money for his family and and build a little life for himself and his family that I feel like is very special and is very like epic without needing to be turned into something that it's not.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 休息过后，**克林特**将谈论他为电影添加的几个角色，以及他不得不删减的书中的场景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: After the break, **Clint** talks about a few characters that he added to the film and the scenes from the book that he had to cut.

</details>

### 新增角色与场景取舍

**Gilbert Cruz**: 有些人认为，您之前也提到过，短篇小说或中篇小说可能更适合改编，因为您需要改编的内容更少。但当然，在这里您讲述的是一个人的故事。所以通常是关于我们从故事中删减什么以适应电影。但您在其中添加了几个角色，或者说几个瞬间，几个场景。您添加了**使徒弗兰克**，那个由**保罗·施耐德**饰演的非常健谈的伐木工人。您还添加了由**凯莉·康登**饰演的**林业局**员工。在仍然尊重中篇小说和**丹尼斯·约翰逊**的前提下，您是如何决定在其中加入自己的故事叙述，加入新角色的？您想通过这些角色表达什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Some people think you you sort of referenced this before, but like a short story, a novella maybe is more optimal for adaptation because right you just have less to adapt. But of course here you're telling the story of a person. So often it's about what are we cutting out of the story in order to fit into a film. But you added a couple characters or a couple moments, a couple scenes into this. You added **Apostle Frank**, the very talkative logger played by **Paul Schneider**. You added the the **Forest Service** employee played by **Carrie Condan**. Paying respects still to the novella and **Dennis Johnson**. How do you make the decision to layer your own storytelling on top of that? I'm putting new characters and then what were you trying to say through those characters?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的，对于**使徒弗兰克**，我觉得书中有几个部分我们需要扩充，**丹尼斯**写了一些关于某个时间段的内容，但只用了三句话。而对于**使徒弗兰克**，特别是为了塑造那个世界中的角色，向我们展示**格林尼尔**为何与这些人以及他所生活的这个世界如此紧密相连。我曾在建筑工地和农场工作过很多团队，总有人话比干活多，你就会想：“拜托，闭嘴吧。”

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah, I with with **Apostle Frank**, I felt like he there were several sections of the book that we needed to build out that **Dennis** had written something about some section of time but then does only writes three sentences about it, you know, and with **Apostle Frank** in particular just about building out the characters of that world to show us why **Grineer** is so connected to these people and and to this to this world that he's living And and I've worked on a lot of crews like in construction and on farms where there's always somebody who talks more than he works and you're just like please just shut up man.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯，您有他，还有**威廉·H·梅西**饰演的角色**阿恩**，他年纪稍大一点，所以他工作不多可能更容易理解，但他就是一直在喋喋不休，他只做一件事，就是炸东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, you have him and you have the the character played by **William H. Macy**. He's **Arn** who is a little bit older so maybe it's a more understandable that he's not working as much but he's just he's just blabbing blabbing blabbing that he does his one job blowing stuff up.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 没错，没错。他有一套特殊的技能。那个角色在书页上比真人还大，**阿恩**。我想说，他在电影中说的话有一半是直接从书里摘录的，然后我们只是努力扩展这个角色，而没有把他推向一个让他感觉不自然的方向。然后是**凯莉·康登**的角色，我们花了一段时间才确定下来。**克莱尔·汤普森**是中篇小说中的一个角色，她是一个他正在运送的寡妇，他们之间没有太多对话，但这在**格林尼尔**的生命中是一个非常重要的时刻，最终她告诉他，在书中，上帝需要树林里的隐士，就像需要讲坛上的传教士一样。这让他对自己的生活有了一点理解，尽管他反问：“我就是个隐士吗？”尽管我们已经看了他70页的隐士生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Exactly. Exactly. He had a he had a particular set of skills. That character is larger than life on the page armed peoples and I'd say like half of the stuff that he says in the film is just from the book just lifted directly from the book and then we were really just trying to expand on that to fill out that character without ever pushing him in a direction that that's felt unnatural to him. And then **Carrie Condan**'s character, that was one that like it took us a while to get there. **Claire Thompson** is a character in the novella, but she's a widow that he's transporting, and there's not much that's said between them, but it's a really important moment in **Grineer**'s life that culminates in her telling him in the book that the the Lord needs a hermit in the woods as much as a preacher in the pulpit. that gives him some measure of like understanding of his life a bit even though he has the question back of like is that what I am a hermit? even though we've watched him for like 70 pages be a hermit.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯，你并不总是了解自己。一个人并不总是了解自己的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, you don't always understand yourself. One doesn't always understand their own life.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 百分之百。所以我们试图做和融入的事情是多方面的。一是保持那个角色的完整性，但稍作扩展。另一个部分是有点主题性和历史性的，就是我们真的想展示那些在太平洋西北地区出现的**防火瞭望塔**。当时发生了很多非常可怕的火灾，有些大约在1921年，有些在10年前，它们摧毁了那个地区。所以后来**林业局**成立了，所有这些**防火瞭望塔**都建在了那个地区，其中很多是由女性操作和管理的。所以这只是我们想要加入的一些质感上的东西，它也从主题上说明了这样一个事实：如果这些**防火瞭望塔**早十年建成，他的家人可能还会活着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: 100%. And so there was like there was this amalgamation of things we were trying to do and fit in. One was like keep that character intact but expand her a bit. And then the other part that is a bit thematic and a bit historical, which is just like we really wanted to show these fire towers that had popped up across the Pacific Northwest. There were a ton of really terrible fires and some around like 1921 and some like 10 years earlier that had gone through and just decimated the area. And so then we have the **Forest Service** that gets created and all these fire watchtowers get put all over the area up there and a lot of them were operated and run by women. And so that was just something texturally that we wanted to put in that also spoke thematically to the fact that if these fire towers had been put up, you know, a decade earlier, his family might still be alive.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。然后那个角色就成了承载很多主题性思考的载体，我觉得我想谈论这些，比如生活在你缺席的情况下继续前进的悲剧，以及生态，我们在这个世界中的位置，以及我们在时间中的位置，所有这些最终都汇聚到书中那句非常有力量的话：世界需要树林里的隐士，就像需要讲坛上的传教士一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah. And then and then that character became a vehicle to talk about a lot of like some thematic things that I felt that I wanted to talk about in terms of you know kind of the like the tragedy of life moving on without you and ecology and our place in the world and our place in time and all of that ultimately building up to that line that's so powerful in the book itself of the world needing a a hermit in the woods as much as the preacher in pulpit.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我想问您另一个场景中的台词，那是他与**凯莉·康登**饰演的角色交谈时说的。她说：“你当时在这里吗？”他说：“我不在。我的妻子和孩子在。他们没能活下来。”然后他描述了他当时的感受，这可能是他第一次描述，至少在电影中是这样。那是一个短暂的闪光，但他描述了他的感受。作为观众，在那之前，您基本上只能通过推断来了解他的感受，而不能依赖角色的对话。但他说：“有时感觉悲伤会把我活活吞噬，有时又感觉这发生在别人身上。”我很幸运，没有经历过那种悲痛。我知道它终将到来，我的父母都还在。但是您是如何——我今天早上又重看了那个场景，我差点哭了。它真的很有感染力。您是如何将情感从书页转移到银幕上的？因为我想您可能看了那个场景20遍，仍然能感受到那种情感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I I want to ask you about another line that occurs when he's talking to the the **Carrie Condan** character. She says, "Were you here for the fire?" He says, "I wasn't. My wife and child were. They didn't make it." And then he describes possibly for the first time, at least in the film. It's a brief glimmer, but he describes what he's feeling. as a viewer, you have to largely up until that point just discern what he is feeling without relying on the character's dialogue. But he says, "Sometimes it feels like the sadness will eat me alive and sometimes it feels like it happened to someone else." I am lucky enough where I have not had to experience that sort of grief. I know it's coming. You know, my parents are still around and all that stuff. But how do you I was just re-watching again that scene this morning and I almost started I almost started crying. It really is affecting. How do you transfer emotion from a page to the screen? Because I think you probably watched that scene 20 times and still feel that emotion.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我的意思是，那句话来自一个非常真实的地方。不幸的是，我确实经历过您所说的那种失去，我的父母在非常短的时间内相继去世。随着时间的推移，这其中也带有一些悲剧性，你确实会从一些你觉得无法摆脱的事情中走出来，有时它感觉非常遥远，有时你醒来时感觉他们就像昨天才去世一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I mean that came from a very real place that line. I unfortunately have dealt with that loss that you're speaking of and and lost both my folks in in a very quick succession and and there was some tragedy to to it as time went on that you you do move on from something you don't feel like you can and and sometimes it feels very distant and sometimes you wake up and it feels like they just passed on yesterday.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我的意思是，作为电影制作人，有一个小窍门，如果你找到一位优秀的演员，他们就能为你承担大部分繁重的工作，将一些可能有点平淡的东西注入情感。你知道，那句话可以有很多不同的表达方式，它可以有点直白，但我认为，**乔尔**作为演员的魔力，正是他作为演员的微妙和细致的证明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I mean, there's a bit of a cheat code with being a filmmaker that if you get a great actor, they can they do the heavy lifting for you in terms of imbuing something like that that could be a bit flat. You know, that that that line could go a lot of different ways and it could be a bit straightforward, but I think that in particular is just the magic of what **Joel** does as an actor is just a testament to his subtlety and nuance as an actor.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那个场景，那个瞬间，在您的记忆中，您需要拍好几次吗？我知道您是在户外拍摄，所以您要确保在光线好的时候完成。但您对拍摄那个瞬间有什么回忆？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Is that a scene? Is that a moment that you to your recollection you had to do a couple times? I know you're filming it outside, so you're trying to make sure you do it while the while the light is good. But what was your recollection of filming that that moment?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我觉得那是一个非常美丽的场景。但那个场景我们开始拍摄时，拍了几次，太阳太高了，对他们来说太刺眼了，他们都眯着眼睛看着对方。所以我们所有人，我的摄影师**阿德洛**和我，还有**乔尔**和**凯莉**，我们都决定：“我们休息一下吧。等一个小时，让阳光变得柔和一些。”所以我们就走开了，休息了一会儿，喝了点茶，然后当我们回来时，那个场景很快就完成了。那个场景基本上就是我们的剪辑师**帕克·拉里**在初剪时剪辑出来的样子，大部分都保持原样。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: That was a really beautiful scene, I think. But that scene we started filming and we did a couple takes and and the sun was too high and it was just too harsh on them and they were both kind of squinting at each other. And so we all, **Adelo**, my cinematographer and I, and and **Joel** and **Carrie**, we all kind of decided like, let's take a break. Like, let's give it an hour, let the sun get softer. And so we just stepped away and like took a moment, had some tea, and then when we got back into it, it all that scene came together very quickly. And that scene is kind of how our editor, **Parker Larie**, first cut it together on the assembly cut. It's largely intact. Yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么作为导演，您觉得对演员坦诚也是您工作的一部分吗？比如，当您和**乔尔**交谈时，您会提及自己经历的悲痛之类的吗？您是否试图通过这种个人联系，向他传达您作为导演和编剧内心的感受？比如，您把他叫到一边，告诉他一些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And do you feel as a a director, is it part of your job to be to be vulnerable with your actors as well? Like are you when you're talking to **Joel**, are you referencing your own experiences with grief and stuff like that? Are you sort of trying to convey what's inside of you as a director and the writer to him through that personal connection? Like you're taking him off to the side and telling him stuff.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 只要有帮助，我们就会这样做。特别是和**乔尔**，我们在开拍前就做了很多这样的事情。我们大部分的准备工作就是深夜里长时间的电话交谈。谈论为人父母，失去家人，以及介于两者之间的一切。我想，这是一种很奇怪的事情，作为导演，我希望在任何时候都尽可能地对他们开放，但又不能让事情围绕着我。你明白我的意思吗？所以，这是为了让他们能够扎根于自己的角色，以及角色在情感上正在经历什么，而不是去想**克林特**在埋葬他母亲时在想什么。所以有很多这样的事情，这有点像它的悲剧性，作为导演，我发现我在场景展开时并没有那么投入情感，也没有那么受它们的情感影响，因为我必须关注很多技术元素，以便在每次拍摄之间给每个人提供反馈，这样我们才能真正利用好时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: As much as it's helpful, you know, we do we specifically with **Joel** and I, we did a lot of that before we ever got on set. And a lot of our prep would just be like these long phone conversations in the middle of the night. Talking about being a parent and losing family and and all the everything in between, you know. I think like it's such a strange thing where you have to as a director I I I want to be as open with them as possible at all times without making it about me. You know what I mean? So it's so it's about so that they can ground themselves in their character and what that character is going through emotionally versus thinking about like what was **Clint** thinking at the like when he when he buried his mother. And so there's a lot of that that just like it's kind of the tragedy of it where as a director I've found like I'm not as emotionally wrapped up in the scenes as they're unfolding and being as emotionally affected by them because I'm having to pay attention to so many technical elements in order to give everybody notes between takes so that we're actually using our time.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这太不可思议了，您必须以某种方式将自己一分为二。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: That's incredible that sort of you have to sort of bifurcate yourself in a way.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的。然后你拍完，大家开始拆卸摄像机，然后你就在角落里哭泣，因为这一切突然间都涌上心头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah. And then you wrap and everybody starts breaking down the cameras and then and then you cry in a corner. Because it all hits you all of a sudden.

</details>

### 电影旁白与结局

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我想问您关于**威尔·帕顿**的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I want to ask you about **Will Patton**.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 《**火车之梦**》的有声书大约在15年前出版。**威尔·帕顿**担任了旁白。他也是您电影的旁白。我相信您知道电影中的旁白可能相当冒险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: The audio book for **Train Dreams** came out, you know, 15 or so years ago. **Will Patton** narrated that. He is the narrator of your film. I'm sure you know narration can be pretty dicey in films. You can go.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您可以有《**肖申克的救赎**》中的**摩根·弗里曼**，也可以有《**银翼杀手**》中的**哈里森·福特**，他们会说：“这太糟糕了。我们实际上要制作一个没有旁白的电影新剪辑版。”您认为电影旁白有哪些陷阱？您是如何确保避免这些陷阱的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You can have **Morgan Freeman** in **The Shawshank Redemption**. You can have **Harrison Ford** in **Blade Runner** where they're like, "This is so bad. We're actually going to make a new cut of this movie in which there's no narration." What would you say are the pitfalls when it comes to film narration? And how did you make sure to try to avoid that?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的，我的意思是，你永远不想做那种事情，比如有人走过一扇门，然后旁白说：“然后他走过了一扇门。”那是你想避免的。这很有趣。《**银翼杀手**》，据我所知，**哈里森·福特**不想那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah, I mean, you never want to do the thing where like somebody walks through a door and then the narrator says, "And then he walked through a door." That's what you want to avoid. And it's funny. **Blade Runner** from what I've read, **Harrison Ford** did not want to do that.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯，我明白为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, I see why.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 是的，是的。所以那也是他表演的一部分，就是“我必须挺过去”。但我喜欢旁白的概念，旁白作为讲故事的人。在这种特殊意义上，旁白就像你发现自己在伐木小镇的一个小酒吧里，深夜时分，一个喝多了啤酒的家伙走过来对你说：“嘿，让我给你讲讲**罗伯特·格林尼尔**的故事。”有人真的在给你讲一个故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Yeah. Yeah. Like, and so that's part of his performance is just like, I got to get through this. But I love the idea of a narrator like a narrator as a storyteller and and in this particular sense a narrator like if you had found yourself in some like little bar in a logging town and you were there late at night and this guy comes up to you who's had too many beers and is like hey let me tell you about this guy **Robert Grineer** and and somebody really like tells you a story.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我总是喜欢《**朱尔与吉姆**》和《**你妈妈也一样**》中的旁白，他们会提供一些与情节无关但与故事息息相关的信息。另一方面，这本书之所以如此成功，其中一个关键因素就是**丹尼斯·约翰逊**的声音，他的叙事声音。所以我强烈认为，这是我们必须融入电影本身的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: And I always love the narrators from like **Jules and Jim** and **Y Tu Mamá También** who who kind of take take aides and tell you things that don't have anything to do with the plot but have everything to do with the story. And then the other side of it was just like one of the integral pieces of why that book works so well is **Dennis Johnson**'s voice, his his narrative voice. And so I really felt strongly that that was something that we had to pull into the to the movie itself.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您的电影受到了很好的评价。我看到的唯一批评是关于基调的变化，比如平滑了一些东西，让**格林尼尔**稍微不那么令人讨厌。您第一次读到的那个角色，电影中由**克利夫顿·柯林斯**饰演的那个家伙，在书中并不是个好人，您后来会了解到，他曾性侵过一个家庭成员。您认为这些改变是您有意为之的吗？因为您想在电影中营造一种不同的感觉？比如**罗伯特·格林尼尔**可能对把他的中国同事推下铁路桥有点过于热情，以及**克利夫顿·柯林斯**饰演的角色不仅在树林里受苦，而且还是个坏人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Your movie has been very well received. The only criticisms I've seen have to do with a change in tone, which is like smoothing a couple things out, making **Grineer** a little less, slightly less unlikable. There's the character that you talk about first time you read, the guy played by **Clifton Collins** in the film, in the book, not a nice guy, as you come to learn, you know, he's sort of sexually abused a family member. Do you see that those things are something that you changed on purpose because you wanted to achieve a kind of different feel in your movie? Those those the idea that **Robert Grineer** is someone who maybe was a little too enthusiastic about throwing his Chinese colleague off a rail bridge and the idea that the **Clifton Collins** character is someone who is not just suffering in the woods but also is a bad person.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您当时是想：“我不需要这些。”我的意思是，关于**克利夫顿**的角色，这很有趣，那个场景有一个完整的10分钟或8分钟的版本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What what were you like I don't think I need this. I mean, there's it's funny with **Clifton**'s character, there's a whole 10 minute or eight minute version of that scene.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Really.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我们拍了整个场景，但它就像90秒。它非常短，这让我感到很糟糕，因为再次强调，那个场景有一些特别之处。我认为**丹尼斯**在他的写作中通常试图做的是，审视一些做过极其堕落事情的人，那些在任何世界里都不可接受的事情，并试图在他们身上找到一丝人性，试图找到他们身上的人性之处，这样我们也许都能以这种方式看待彼此。是的，作为他的作品的读者，这是我的看法。我认为**克利夫顿**的那个场景就是一个例子。但问题是，它在电影中就是行不通。无论我们把它放在哪里，即使只是结构上，它都行不通，感觉就像突然来自另一部电影。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: We filmed the whole thing and it just like it's like 90 seconds. It's very it's if that Yeah. Yeah. It's very short, which I felt terrible about because again, there's something about that that scene. And what I think **Dennis** did in his writing in general was to try and look at some people who had done incredibly depraved things and things that are in no world okay and try and find some little glimmer of humanity in them and try and find what's what's human about them so that we all maybe look at each other that way. Right. I that that's my take as as a reader of his of his work. And I think that scene with **Clifton** is an example of that from my perspective. But the thing is like it just didn't work in the movie. Like nowhere we put it even just structurally like there was nowhere we put it where it where it worked without feeling like it was suddenly coming from a different movie.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 所以它是一个如此有力的形象和事物，我觉得我们不能失去它。所以剩下的就是他用靴子给这个人水喝。然后旁白说他不喜欢回忆生命中的那个时刻，你知道，对于没有读过这本书的人来说，这可能没有任何意义，但希望能向它致敬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: And so yet it was an image and and something that was like so potent that I felt like we couldn't lose it. And so just what remains is him giving this guy a drink of water from his boot. And then you know the narration says that he didn't like to think about that moment from his life to you know it's not going to mean anything to anybody who hasn't read the book but hopefully to pay homage to to that.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 另一件事是，我的意思是，电影中的**格林尼尔**确实帮助了，他帮助了一会儿。他被卷入这种暴力中，帮助把这个人抬到桥边。是的，抓住了他的腿。抓住了他的腿，帮助把他抬上去。然后被踢了下来。那个场景在电影中没有像书中那样详细展开。部分原因只是因为媒介不同。我读过那些批评。我对此没有什么回应，除了我觉得有些事情，我的观点可能会随着我作为艺术家的成长而演变。但我认为有些事情在文学中是可行的。有时你可以与一些非常艰难的事情保持一定的距离，但在电影中，在电影院里，你无法保持那种情感距离。火灾就是一个很好的例子。火灾以及**格拉迪斯**的幻象，以及她如何死去，还有孩子如何被卷入火灾。在早期剪辑中，那是一个更长的片段，但它需要一个校准，比如：“好吧，我们让人们经历多少，我们又回报给他们什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: The other thing with like I mean **Grineer** in the movie does help he helps for a moment. He gets swept up in this violence of helping carry this guy up towards the bridge. Yeah. Grab grabs his legs. Grabs his legs to help take him up. Gets kicked off. that scene is not as built out as it is in the book. Partly just because of again a different medium and I've read the criticism. I don't really have any any response to it other than like there's things I think that like again I might my my viewpoints on this might evolve as I evolve as an artist. But I think there are things that can work and that you can do in literature. There there's a bit of sometimes a a distance you can have from something very tough that you can't have that emotional distance from it in film in the same way in in cinema. The fire is a good example of that. The fire and and the vision of **Gladys** and and how she dies and and the kid like how they get swept up in the fire. That's a very in early edits that was a much longer sequence but it was a cal it had to be a calibration of like okay how much how much are we putting people through and what are we giving them in return.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的，我的意思是，即使没有那些画面，那部分也已经够悲伤了。我还有最后一个问题。您曾称**丹尼斯·约翰逊**中篇小说的结局是文学中最伟大的结局之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah I mean that part is pretty sad without those images already. Uh I have one more question. You have called the ending of **Dennis Johnson**'s novella one of the great endings in literature.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 这不是夸张。我确实是这个意思。我有点想读一下结局，然后问您为什么认为它很棒，但它相当长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: It's not hyperbole. I I do mean that. I I sort of want to read the ending and then ask you why you think it's great, but it's quite long.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您不同意它很棒吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Do you disagree that it's that it's great?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我听了有声书版本，快到结尾了。是**威尔·帕顿**的声音，当书停止时，我的心也停止了。我觉得它太不可思议了。你知道吗？我要读一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I listened to the audiobook version and it was coming to the end. It's **Will Patton** and it my heart stopped when when the book stopped. I I thought it was incredible. You know what? I am going to read it.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您应该读一下，如果您愿意可以剪掉。我会听的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You should read it and then you can cut it out if you want. I'll listen to it.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 然后您会告诉我为什么它如此伟大。所以请耐心听我说。这是**丹尼斯·约翰逊**的《**火车之梦**》的结局。主人公**罗伯特·格林尼尔**在一个剧院里观看一个被称为“狼孩”的人在舞台上的表演。但当他静止地站在舞台中央，双臂平伸，身体僵硬，开始以巨大的内在活力颤抖时，所有人都突然安静下来，非常突然。在场的没有人见过有人站得如此静止，却又如此奇异地富有动感。他将头向后仰，直到头皮接触到脊椎那么远，然后张开喉咙，剧院里响起一种声音，像风从四面八方吹来，低沉而恐怖，从地板下的地面隆隆升起。它汇聚成一声咆哮，吞噬了听觉本身，并凝结成一种声音，穿透鼻窦，最终进入所有听到它的人的脑海。它越来越高，越来越可怕，也越来越美丽。它是所有此类声音的最初理想，是雾笛和船笛，是火车孤独的汽笛声，是歌剧的歌唱，是长笛的音乐，以及风笛持续的呜咽声。然后突然一切都变黑了，那个时代永远消失了。他很棒。他很不错。他知道自己在做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: And then you're going to tell me why you why it's so great. So bear with me. This is the ending of **Dennis Johnson**'s **Train Dreams**. The main character, **Robert Grineer**, is in a theater watching a performance on stage by by someone that is referred to as a a wolf boy. But they hushed all at once and quite abruptly when he stood still at center stage, his arms straight out from his shoulders and went rigid and began to tremble with a massive inner dynamism. Nobody present had ever seen anyone stand so still and yet so strangely mobile. He laid his head back until his scalp contacted his spine that far back and open his throat and a sound rose in the auditorium like a wind coming from all four directions low and terrifying rumbling up from the ground beneath the floor. And it gathered into a roar that sucked at the hearing itself and coalesced into a voice that penetrated into the sinuses and finally into the very minds of those hearing it. taking itself higher and higher, more and more awful and beautiful. The originating ideal of all such sounds ever made, of the fog horn and the ship's horn, the locomotives lonesome whistle, of opera singing and the music of flutes and the continuous moan music of bag pipes. And suddenly it all went black and that time was gone forever. He was pretty good. He was okay. He knew what he was doing.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 为什么它如此伟大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Why is that so great?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我的意思是，当您读到那里时，我当时想，这就是电影的结局。太完美了。那将是多么棒的结局啊。然后我们拍摄了那个场景，然后发生了两件事。第一，你很快就会意识到，至少以我作为电影制作人目前的能力，我无法翻译那种魔力。你如何表现“所有此类声音的最初理想”？对吧？那听起来像什么？我们尝试了一些声音设计版本来制作类似的声音，但做不到。然后同时，我们有一个非常早期的飞机序列版本。书中也有，它将引向这个结局。我们当时在看电影，很清楚，在那个飞机序列之后，电影就结束了。就是这样。剩下的部分就有点拖沓了。作为艺术家或电影制作人，你要么听从它，要么自担风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I mean, as soon as you like I I came to that and I was like, that's the end of the movie. That's perfect. That's going to be fantastic to what what an ending. And then we shot that and then two things happened. One, you realize very quickly, at least for where for my abilities now as a filmmaker, I could not translate the magic of that. How do you do the originating ideal of all such sounds ever made? Right? What does that sound like? And we tried some versions in sound design to make something like that and couldn't do it. And then simultaneously like we had a very early version of the plane sequence. It's in the book as well and that was going to lead up to this ending. And we were watching the film down and it was just so clear that after that plane sequence, the film was over. Like that's it. And and then the rest of it just kind of trailing off. And as an artist or a filmmaker, you either listen to that or you don't at your own peril.

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

**Clint Bentley**: 所以我听从了它，我们开始围绕着**双翼飞机**序列重新构建结局，让它成为电影的自然结局。我的意思是，这是一个非常感人的结局。这部电影长时间以来都非常接地气，然后在最后的时刻，仿佛他升入天堂，他生命的最后时刻。你飞向空中，然后就结束了。它很棒。

**Clint Bentley**: And so I listen to it and we started restructuring the ending around the the biplane sequence and and letting that be the the the natural ending of the film. I mean, it's a very moving ending. You have this movie that is so earthbound for so long and then in its final moments almost as if he's ascending to heaven, the final moments of his life. It's you go up into the air and then and then it's over. It was great.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 谢谢您。非常感谢。

### 书籍推荐

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么**克林特**，十多年来，每周《**纽约时报书评**》都会向作家们提出一系列关于他们的阅读和阅读生活的问题。这是我们称之为“**购书指南**”系列的一部分。所以，**克林特·本特利**，我有一些非常具体的书籍问题要问您。首先，您最喜欢哪本没人听说过的书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So **Clint**, for more than a decade, every week, the **New York Times Book Review** has asked authors a recurring set of questions about their reading and their reading lives. It's it's part of a series that we call **Buy the Book**. So, **Clint Bentley**, I have some extremely specific book questions for you. First, what is your favorite book that no one else has heard of?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 有一本书我向很多人推荐过，我三天前刚推荐给一个人，那是一本没人听说过的书，但我找到有人读过它。它叫做《**比利小子的全集**》，作者是**迈克尔·翁达杰**。它远不止听起来那么简单。这是一本非常奇怪的书，是短篇小说、照片和诗歌的合集。它很难归类。这是一本非常神奇的书，你翻开每一页都不知道会遇到什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: There was there's one that I have recommended to so many people and and I just found I I just recommended to someone like three days ago and it it was one that no one had ever heard of, but I found somebody who's read it. It's called **The Collected Works of Billy the Kid**. It's by **Michael Ondaatje**. It's it's so much more than what it sounds like. It's this very strange book that is a collection of short stories, photographs, poetry. It's just like it's hard to categorize what exactly it is. It's a very magical book where you like you don't know what you're going to encounter as you flip each page.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我从未听说过这本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I've never heard of this.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 太棒了。他还有另一部类似的作品，我正从图书馆借来准备阅读。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: It's fantastic. He's got another one that he did a similar thing with that I' I've got like coming from the library so I can so I can read it. But

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我喜欢您是个图书馆常客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I I love that you're a library guy.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 永远都是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Always.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 有没有您最近才第一次读的经典小说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Are there any classic novels that you only just recently read for the first time?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 嗯，是的。这是一个持续进行的事情。我感觉我总是在追赶。我这里有一本我刚拿起来的，我遗憾地从未读过《**到灯塔去**》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Well, yeah. Yeah, that is an ongoing thing. I feel like I'm I'm forever catching up. One that I've got here that I just picked up that I I sadly have never read **To the Lighthouse**.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 哦，哇。我读过**弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫**的散文，但我从未读过她的一整本书。所以我就选了这本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Oh wow. I've I've read like I've read **Virginia Woolf**'s Pros, but I've never read a full book by her and so um and so I just picked out.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 您那里有副本吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: You have a copy there?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，是的。是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您特别喜欢阅读哪些类型？有没有您会避免的，就是不喜欢的那种？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And are there any that you avoid? Just are not to your liking?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 没有我避免的类型。有些我读得比较少，比如我不太读科幻小说，但不是因为不喜欢，只是不知道我是否那么被它吸引。但我最喜欢的书和最吸引我的东西是那些不属于特定类型，并且打破了它们所处类型的惯例的书，比如**翁达杰**那本书，或者我最近才开始读**约翰·伯格**的一些小说，非常可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: There are no genres that I avoid. There are ones that I read less like I don't read that much sci-fi, but not out of not liking it, just just out of like I don't know that I'm as drawn to it. But the books that I love the most and the things that I'm drawn to the most are books that like aren't of a specific genre and break and and break apart the conventions of whatever genre they're working in like that on **Ondaatje** book or I've just gotten into **John Berger** recently and and started reading some of his no some of his fiction which is lovely.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 有没有您会推荐的特定书名？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Is there a specific title that you would recommend?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我会推荐，但有点不按顺序。他写了一个三部曲，我偶然发现了。我从第二部开始读的，叫做《**欧洲往事**》，它是一个短篇小说集。我想《**火车之梦**》的粉丝可能也会喜欢那本书，因为它们有非常相似的主题，关于生活继续前进，留下人们，以及现代化带来的一些美好的事物和一些真正悲剧性的事物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I would and it's a bit out of order. He did this trilogy that I just like stumbled upon. The second one is the one that I started with and that I read called **Once in Europa**, but it's a collection of it's like a short story cycle. And I think for fans of **Train Dreams** might be fans of that as well because there's very similar themes about life kind of moving on and leaving people behind and some wonderful things coming from from modernization and and some really tragic things coming from it.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您是一位显然热爱书籍和阅读的电影制作人。有没有一本关于电影制作的书，您会推荐大家阅读？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You're a filmmaker who obviously loves books and loves reading. Is there a book about film making that you would recommend that people read?

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 哦，是的。我会给您推荐几本，取决于您的喜好。我发现有一些由电影制作人撰写或关于电影制作人的书，我认为非常特别。**安德烈·塔可夫斯基**有一本叫做《**雕刻时光**》，那是一本非常非凡的书。他在生命即将结束时写了这本书，它不仅是他对自己生活的反思，也是他对电影形式的反思。所以它既有他传记性地讲述自己如何成为一名艺术家，也谈论了他认为电影形式的特别之处和独特之处。还有一本关于**大卫·里恩**的书，就叫《**大卫·里恩传**》。它很厚，但它一部电影一部电影地讲述。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: Oh, yes. I'll give you a couple depending on your flavor. I find there there's there's been a few that have been written by or about filmmakers that are really I think special. **Andrei Tarkovsky** has one, **Andrei Tarkovsky** has one called **Sculpting in Time** that is a really phenomenal book and he he was at the end of his life towards the end of his life when he wrote it and it's very much like not only him reflecting on his life but him reflecting on the form and so it's got both him speaking biographically about how he became who he is as an artist while also talking about what he feels like is special about the form and and unique about the form. There's another one about **David Lean**. It's just called **David Lean, a biography**. And it just it's like that thick, but it goes film by film.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 当然，**大卫·里恩**的传记注定是史诗般的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Of course, a biography of **David Lean** is going to be epic.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 而且它真的很好，我认为它真的不仅能让你一窥那位艺术家，还能让你看到电影作为一种媒介在20世纪的发展。最后我要说的一本与电影无关，但我非常喜欢，并推荐给所有人。它叫做《**科尔特兰论科尔特兰**》，是**约翰·科尔特兰**的访谈集。我作为艺术家和对生活都从中学到了很多。它真的是一本非常特别的书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: And it's really got to be it's really good and I think really like gives a glimpse not only of that artist, but also of like film developing over the like like film as a medium developing over the 20th century. And last one I'll say is not film related, but I love it and I recommend it to everybody. It's called **Coltrane on Coltrane** and it's a collection of interviews with with **John Coltrane** that I I have learned so much as an artist and and and about life. Like it's such a it's such a special book.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我想就是这样了。我想我问完了所有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I think that's it. I I think I ran out of questions.

</details>

**Clint Bentley**: 我觉得我们还可以再聊一个小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Clint Bentley**: I feel like we could talk for another hour.
