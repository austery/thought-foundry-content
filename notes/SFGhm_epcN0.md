title: 告别职场行话：如何用“周末语言”提升沟通影响力

### 职场沟通的“周末语言”之谜

大家好，我是来自**挪威主权财富基金**（Norges Bank Investment Management: 挪威政府运营的全球最大主权财富基金）的尼古拉·坦根。今天，我们将与安迪·克雷格对话，他可能是世界上在商业故事讲述方面首屈一指的专家。事情是这样的，在周末，我们总能听到很多有趣的轶事和故事，但一到办公室，我们却变得如此无聊。那么，安迪，请告诉我们这是为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, I'm Nicola Tangan of the Norwegian SN wealth fund, and today we are going to talk to Andy Craig, probably the world leading expert on storytelling in business. And the thing is, during the weekend, we are so funny anecdotes, funny stories, you know, all these kind of things. We get into the office and we are so boring. And so Andy, tell us, why is that?</p>
</details>

这可能有很多原因，但我认为有时我们忘记了在周末使我们成为优秀沟通者的特质，并在周一早上将其留在了办公室门外。如果你回想一下周末，是什么让我们表现出色？我们的语言更简单，更具对话性，我们更常直切要点，最重要的是，我们讲述故事。这些故事能阐明我们的观点，并带有生动具体的细节，这是一种让你的沟通更自然、更人性化、更真实、更具吸引力的方式。所以，“周末语言”实际上是将所有那些行话、那些密集的**PowerPoint**（演示文稿软件）幻灯片材料、那些有时会出现在我们工作日演示和对话中的三、四、五个字母的缩写词，转化为对话式的表达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It can be any number of reasons, but I think sometimes we forget what makes us great communicators on the weekends, and we leave that at the office door on Monday mornings. So if you just think back to the weekends, what makes us really good? Our language is simpler, it's much more conversational, we're to the point more often than not, and most importantly, we tell stories, stories that illustrate our point, that have vivid, concrete details to them, and that is a way of making your communication more natural, more human, more authentic, more engaging. So what weekend language really is, is the conversational translation of all that jargon, all that dense PowerPoint slide material, the three, four, and five litter acronyms that sometimes find its way into our presentations and conversations on the weekday.</p>
</details>

### 职场行话的弊端与克服

我们为什么会切换到这种模式？我认为这可能源于组织内部的压力、焦虑，或者感觉自己没有被允许使用不同的语言。但很大程度上，这已经根植于商业沟通的结构中，行话占据主导地位。我对行话有两个根本性的挑战。首先，它造成了一种压倒性的雷同。如果每家公司都声称自己是“领先的关键任务无缝解决方案提供商，能够通过强大的智能和可操作的洞察力**优化**（optimize: 使达到最佳状态）、**变现**（monetize: 将某物转化为金钱）和**操作化**（operationalize: 使某物可操作或投入使用）业务，并实现十倍的提升”，那么实际上没有人能做到。其次，真正的巨大挑战是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do we switch? I think it could be anything from stress, from anxiety, from pressure inside the organization, from not feeling like perhaps we have permission, but a lot of is just baked into the fabric of business communication where jargon leads the way, and I have really two fundamental challenges with jargon. The first is it creates a crushing sameness. If every single company is the leading provider of mission critical seam of solutions that optimize, monetize and operationalize businesses with robust intelligence and actionable intelligence and a 10x improvement, then nobody is that. And then the second really the big challenge is that hey, first all tell me you you used a lot of you used a lot of super boring bargain there, but what is like what's the worst jargon you know?</p>
</details>

你刚才用了许多非常无聊的行话，但你认为最糟糕的行话是什么？我认为“优化”是我最不喜欢的词之一。“变现”也确实如此。现在，人们经常使用“转型”这个词。变革性的、具有转化力的，你可以在人工智能的核心看到这一点。我们似乎又回到了**互联网泡沫时期**（dot-com movement: 指20世纪90年代末互联网公司股票飙升后又迅速破裂的经济现象）的许多行话和沟通障碍的循环中。我们又回到了一个循环中，这是因为事情很复杂，确实很难。将一个想法、一项技术、一个商业模式从复杂变为清晰明了，需要大量的工作。所以你会看到人们试图摆脱这种困境。如果你观察许多不同的人工智能公司，它们都在创造“变革性的体验”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, first of all, tell me, you used a lot of super boring jargon there, but what is like, what's the worst jargon you know? I think optimize is a is a particular uh least favorite of mine. Monetize really, you see today people using transformation a lot. Transformational, transformative, you can see this right at the heart of AI. We're kind of going back through many of the same cycles of jargon and communication barriers that we did maybe during the dotc movement. It's we're back in a cycle, and it's because it's complex. It it's really difficult. It takes a lot of work to take an idea, a technology, a business model from complex to crystal clear. And so you see people trying to punch out of this bag, and if you look across many different AI companies, there's a lot of creating transformative experiences.</p>
</details>

为什么这么多公司使用相同的无聊行话？我认为这很容易。首先，它很简单，不需要太多工作。另一方面，将事物转化为简单、清晰、引人入胜的沟通方式却非常困难。这是第一点。第二点是，人们常常觉得，如果我不使用这种语言，我就无法融入其中，无法参与其中。所以，这几乎是在承认你想要和别人一样。我遇到过很多销售人员，他们想用同样的产品以同样的方式来竞争。这样你就只能在价格上竞争了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do so many companies use the same boring jargon? I think it's easy. I think one is it's easy, it doesn't take a lot of work. The flip side of that is it's really difficult to translate something into simple, clear, compelling communication. So that's the first part. The second part is oftentimes people feel like they, if I don't use this language, I won't be one of the mix, I won't be in the game. So it's it's almost you're acknowledging that you want to be the same as other people. And I met a lot of salespeople who want to compete uh with the same product that is described in the same way. Now you're competing on price.</p>
</details>

在组织内部，高层和下层员工之间是否存在同样的问题？我相信是存在的。我认为我所见过的那些在消除行话、去除冗长**PowerPoint**幻灯片、摆脱内部语言，转向更引人入胜、更清晰的沟通方面取得最大进展的组织，都是从高层开始的。就像商业中的任何其他事情一样，中层或更低级别的员工需要感到他们有权使用不同的、更易懂的语言。因此，在那些首席执行官以身作则的组织中，你会看到整个组织中人们讲述更多的故事，因为他们在模仿这种行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In organization, is it the same between kind of bosses and people further down? Do we have the same problem? I I believe we do, and I think the the organizations that I've seen make the most progress in removing the jargon, removing the dense PowerPoint slides, getting the inside language out of the way to something more compelling, something clearer, are those that start at the top. It's like anything else in business, the person midlevel or below needs to feel like they have permission to speak in a to use different language many times and more accessible language. And so the ones where the CEO leads by the way, you see people telling more stories throughout the organization because they're modeling that sort of behavior.</p>
</details>

多年前，我们曾在一个大型软件公司进行一次会议，当时我们正在讨论故事讲述、清晰的计算机沟通、翻译和对话式语言。一位年轻的高管举手说：“我完全同意这一切。很多时候，我在会议中不知道别人在说什么，但如果我不使用高级副总裁在这个组织中使用的语言，比如‘优化’、‘变现’，他们就会认为我不理解，不属于这个‘部落’，不属于这个群体。”这确实是一个文化问题，但其中也包含了一定的真相，不是吗？对我来说，这更多是一个文化问题，而不是沟通问题，但两者密切相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We were once in a session years ago at a large software company, and we're talking about storytelling about clear computer communication translation conversational language, and a younger executive kind of raised her hand and said, I completely agree with all of this. There are many times when I'm in a session and I don't know what's being said, but if I don't use the language that the SVP is using in this organization, the optimize, the monetize, got to help us to recontextualize what happens is they don't think I understand it, that I'm not part of the the tribe, part of the group. That that's a culture issue, but there is an element truth in that, isn't it? There is. To me, that's more of a culture issue than a communication issue, but they're very closely linked.</p>
</details>

你需要身居高位才能开始使用更“正常”的语言吗？我不认为你需要，但我认为这和其他任何事情一样重要，它需要一定程度的自信。是的，它需要一定程度的努力去转化，也需要一定程度的自信去坚持并相信简单会每次都胜出。所以我并不是总要求消除行话，那当然很棒，但我认为这不太可能发生，我们至少已经为此努力了几十年。也许是一种转化，这就是我们谈论“魔法词汇”的原因。我们从“重新语境化”的角度来谈论它，这实际上意味着“砰”地一下，实现差异化。或者我们从“优化”的角度来谈论它。让我举一个实际的例子，用我们的一个产品来“优化”，是什么让我们与众不同。这些不同的短语是可能兼顾两种方式的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Do you need to be high up in the organization to start using a more normal language? I don't think you need to be, but I think it's as important as anything else. It takes a level of confidence, right? It does, it does, it takes a it takes a degree of work to translate and it takes a degree of confidence to stand and know that simple will win out each time. And so I'm not calling always for the elimination, that would be terrific, but I don't really see that happening. We've been kicking at this can for several decades at the very least, perhaps a translation that's why we talk about things like the magic words. So we talk about it in terms of recontextualizing and what that really means is Boom, differentiate or we talk about it in terms of optimizing. Let me give an example of what that actually looks like to optimize with one of our products, what makes us different. These different phrases are ways of maybe having it both ways.</p>
</details>

### 培养有效沟通：记者思维与实践

你如何训练人们更有效地沟通，更多地采用基于故事的叙述方式？首先，你要在叙述上下功夫。我想有几点值得注意。首先，我们谈论的是采纳一种**记者思维**（journalist's mindset: 像记者一样思考，关注事实、故事和受众）。我们所有的教练都有一定程度的新闻背景，要么是为此上过学，要么是真正在现实世界中做过一段时间的记者。但我真的认为，如果你思考新闻业的技艺，它在这里会非常有价值，它能帮助你寻找故事中的优秀元素，然后以正确的顺序和流程来构建故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you train people in this to communicate more effectively, more in a story based narrative? Yeah, you first you work on the narrative. So I would say a couple things come to mind. The first is we talk about adopting a journalist's mindset. So all of our coaches have some degree of Journalism background, either went to school for it or actually were journalists out in the real world for a while, but I really think that if you think about the craft of Journalism, it can be very valuable here on Hunting to find the good elements of a story and then crafting a story in the right order in the right flow.</p>
</details>

所以，想想记者每天做的两项工作。第一项是他们必须去做报道。我必须去做研究，我必须采访人们，我必须提出好问题。我正在寻找意义、总结，我正在寻找故事、数据和转化。这些都是构成一个好故事的元素。记者要做的第二项工作是，一旦他们收集了所有这些信息，并且有了更多的选择，他们必须将其按正确的顺序排列，从对读者、听众、观众来说最重要的事情开始，向下排列。所以，第一件事是真正地思考并教授，就像一门新闻学101课程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you think about the two jobs a journalist has every day. The first one is they got to go do the reporting. I have to go do the research, I have to interview people, I have to ask great questions. I'm looking for the meaning, the summarization, I'm looking for the stories, I'm looking for the data and the translation. Those are the elements that make up a great story. The second job a journalist has to do is once they've compiled all of this and they have more options, they've got to put it in the right order, so from the most important thing to the reader, listener, viewer, audience down. So that's the first thing is really thinking through and teaching almost like a journalism 101 course.</p>
</details>

第二件事是，使用摄像机，关闭**PowerPoint**作为起点。仅仅思考大声说出来，录下来，回放，然后像你坐在第15排或会议室桌子的另一边一样去审视它，就像你的听众在两周、30天、60天后会做的那样。所以，摄像机的价值在于它会捕捉到一切：你说了什么，你是怎么说的，你说的时候看起来怎么样。但作为沟通者，你必须开始以听众在“比赛日”观看和聆听的方式来审视你的演示。他们不会只是坐在那里阅读，你不会给他们发一份稿子让他们读。他们不会自己坐在那里阅读，他们也不会自己点击你的幻灯片。他们会观看和聆听你。所以，开始以他们的方式来捕捉和回顾它。这将帮助你回答这些问题：这对他们重要吗？他们关心吗？他们理解吗？这对他们有吸引力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing is engage the video camera, close the PowerPoint as a starting point alone. Think about starting out loud, record it, play it back, and now consume it as if you were in in the 15th row or the other side of the conference room table, like your audience will in 2 weeks, 30 days, 60 days. So the value of the video camera is that it's going to capture everything, what you said, how you said it, what you look like when you say it. But you have to as a communicator start to consume your presentation in the same way that your audience will on game day. They're not going to just sit there and read, you're not going to send them a script and read it to them. They're not going to sit there and read it themselves, they're not going to click through your slides themselves. They're going to watch and listen to you. So start to grab it and and review it in the way that they will. That'll help you answer the questions, does this matter to them? Do they care about it? Do they understand it? Is it compelling to them?</p>
</details>

### 肢体语言与故事的力量

你比我更多地使用手势，你已经用了不少了。告诉我，它有什么作用？嗯，你首先需要做的是思考你的叙述是什么，你要说什么。这是任何演示的第一步。一旦你把这一点理顺了，你对自己的状态感觉良好，对你要说什么以及如何说有了信心，现在你就进入了表达部分，包括声音上你如何说，以及视觉上你说的时候看起来怎么样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you use your hands much more than I do, so you used them already a lot. I I us right, tell me a it do what does it do? Yeah, well, the first thing you need to do is think about what your narrative is, what you're saying. That's the first step to any presentation. Once you get that ironed out, you feel good about where you are, you got a little confidence in what you're going to say and the way you're going to say it, now you get into the delivery parts, which is vocally how are you saying it and visually what do you look like when you say it.</p>
</details>

当谈到手势时，我经常被问到：手势是好是坏？它们既不好也不坏。对于任何表达方式，关键在于找到一个平衡点。我可能被指责做得太多的是过于活跃，手势太多，这可能会分散注意力。这时我需要回到一个“主基地”，也许是像这样把手放在下面，一个舒服的姿势，带来一些平静和安宁。但完全没有手势也不太像对话。我几年前的一些研究发现，当我们使用手势时，我们实际上正在翻阅大脑中的信息档案，寻找那段信息——“哦，它就在那里！”所以，手势与我们所说的话之间存在联系。你希望这三者——言语、声音和视觉——所传达的所有信息都是一致的。因为一旦它们不一致，问题就出现了，听众就会试图弄清楚你的意思和意图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when it comes to gestures, I get asked all the time, are gestures good or are they bad? They're neither necessarily. With any sort of delivery thing, it's about finding a balance somewhere in between. Now what I can be accused of doing too much is being too animated, too much hands, and it can get distracting. That's a point at which I got to come back to a home base, maybe maybe something like this down below, something comfortable to bring some stillness and some calm. But having no gestures alone is not very conversational. What I found from some research years ago was that when we're using gestures, we're actually going through the filing cabinets of information in our brain saying, where was that piece of inf, oh, there it is right there. So there's a connection to what we're saying. What you want from any of these three things, verbal, vocal, and visual, is for all the messages that are being sent to be the same, because the point at which they're different, now you've got an issue, now the audience is trying to figure out what's your meaning, what's your intent.</p>
</details>

如果我们花更多时间思考是什么让语言变得有趣，为什么故事能深入人心？因为作为人类，我们天生就倾向于讲述带有生动具体细节的故事。更重要的是，我们的听众也天生就倾向于消费、处理和回忆故事。如果你看一些信息，行为心理学家苏珊·温申克写了一本名为《演讲者需要了解的关于人的100件事》的书，她的清单上的第六条是：人们以故事形式处理信息效果最好。我们非常喜欢《粘性：为什么有些想法能存活，有些却消亡》这本书，我们多年前曾与作者奇普·希思和丹·希思合作过，从他们那里学到了很多，他们是很棒的合作伙伴。他们通过这本书从头到尾清晰地阐明，故事是最令人难忘的讲述形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if we spend a bit more time on what is that makes language interesting, uh why why do stories stick? Because as human beings, we are hardwired to tell stories with vivid, concrete details. Probably more importantly, our audiences are hardwired to consume, process, and recall them. So if you look at a couple of pieces of information, Susan Winschenk is a behavioral psychologist. She wrote the book "100 Things That Every Presenter Needs to Know About People." Number six on her list was people process information best in story form. "Made to Stick" is a book that we love, we've worked with the authors Chip and Dan Heath years ago, we learned a lot from them, they're great partners. And what they clearly illustrate through their book from cover to cover is that stories are the most memorable form of storytelling.</p>
</details>

因此，作为叙述者和演讲者，我们的目标是当下有意义，事后更令人难忘。所以，如果你在下一次演示中想给自己最大的成功机会，抓住并吸引你的听众，说出一些令人难忘且事后可回忆的东西，那么就把你想要传达的最重要的事情，用一个故事来包装它。这样，你就能以一种更人性化的方式传达信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So our objective as narrators, as presenters, is to be meaningful in the moment and more memorable afterwards. So if at your next presentation you want to give yourself the best chance of success for grabbing and hooking your audience and saying something that is memorable and recallable later on, take the most important thing you're trying to get across in that presentation and wrap a story around it that says that thing, and that way you're delivering a message but in a way that's much more human.</p>
</details>

### 故事的构建：具体细节与新闻学五要素

如何让故事变得有趣和难忘？我们需要哪些特点？具体生动的细节。无论是使用客户案例、设想场景、背景故事、起源故事、类比还是隐喻，关键在于具体生动细节的恰当平衡。最好的起点是回到新闻编辑室，回到新闻学101。那具体是什么样的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how do you make a story interesting and memorable? What are the features that we need to have in there? Concrete, vivid details. That's the case whether you are using a customer example, whether you're using an imagine scenario, a backstory, an origin story, an analogy, or a metaphor. It's about having the right balance of concrete, vivid details, and the best place to start is back in the newsroom, so back to journalism 101. What does that actually look like?</p>
</details>

所以，假设你要给我讲一个你在组织中做的最好的例子，尼古拉。为了说明这一点，你会说：“让我给你一个例子，看看那是什么样的。”然后你会给我讲一个关于你合作、投资的某个公司的故事，无论情况如何。我希望至少在准备过程中，从新闻学的**五要素**（five Ws: Who, What, When, Where, Why）开始。用这些来构建故事的骨架：是谁？是什么时候？在哪里？为什么这对他们的业务或你的业务很重要？实际发生了什么？结果是什么？当你开始在准备过程中填充这些具体细节时，你实际上正在走上一条能让我理解和处理的道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's imagine you're going to give me your best example of what you do at your organization, Nikolai, and to illustrate that you're gonna say, let me just give you one example of what that looks like. And you're going to tell me a story about one of the companies that you work with, invest in, whatever the case might be. I want to start in the preparation process at the very least with the five ws of Journalism. Use those to build the scaffolding of the story, who was it, when was it, where was it, why did it matter to their business or your business, what actually happened, what were the results of them?</p>
</details>

然后你就可以开始寻找故事中的故事，它的意义是什么？这是一个关键点。多年前，在电影《飞机、火车和汽车》中，有一个有趣的时刻，史蒂夫·马丁对约翰·坎迪大喊：“你总是讲这些故事，但它们没有细节！你知道吗？当你讲故事的时候，要有一个重点！”这会让听众觉得有趣得多。你知道，这很有趣，但也很真实。故事的重点是什么？它如何阐明，为什么它对我重要？我需要了解哪些元素才能进一步参与？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you start populating in the preparation with those concrete details, you're actually on a path to getting something that I can put in my head and I can process. Then you can start looking for what are the stories inside the story, what's the meaning of that, what that's a key point. There was actually a a funny moment in a movie "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" years ago where Steve Martin was yelling at John Candy and he said, you're constantly telling these stories, but they have no details in them. You know, here's an idea, when you tell a story, have a point, it makes it so much more interesting for the listener, you know, and it's funny, but it's true. What's the point of the story? How does it illustrate and why does it matter to me? And what are the elements that I would need to know about to engage a little bit further?</p>
</details>

你如何描绘故事？你如何把它拖出来？这是一个很好的问题。我不确定是否有确切的数字。我见过一些非常短小精悍的精彩故事，比如30秒或更短。我也见过一些可能长达两分钟的故事。你必须知道你对听众的要求是什么，并且必须确保故事不会拖沓。这就是为什么不仅要有教练，还要在其他人面前练习这个故事。如果故事拖得太长，或者偏离了重点，但我想说，如果你深入到一个具体的故事中，30秒到两分钟可能是一个合适的范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much do you paint out the story? Just how much do you drag it out? Oh, that's a great question. I'm not sure if there's any one number. I've seen some great stories that are really short and tight, you know, 30 seconds or less. I've also seen some that might stretch to two minutes. You got to know what you're asking of your audience and you've got to make sure that that story doesn't drag on. That's why it's good to have not just a coach potentially, but to practice in front of other people. That story it's dragging on way too long, or it's really missing the point. But I would say anywhere from you know, an actual dive into an individual story, if you're looking 30 seconds to two minutes, you're probably in the right ballpark.</p>
</details>

### 澄清“简化”与“知识的诅咒”

我们是否存在“简化”事物的危险？我的意思是，你在书中谈到了“简化”。我们应该如何看待这个问题？是的，我没有足够大的影响力将许多事情归类为“战斗词汇”，但“简化”这个词对我来说就是这样。我发现它是一个非常令人沮丧的短语，因为首先，它贬低了使复杂事物变得清晰所需的艰苦工作。要做到或理解复杂事物需要大量的工作。所以对我来说，“简化”就是“领先的提供商”、“关键任务”、“无缝”——那些你只需出现并脱口而出的东西。这是一种更懒惰的沟通形式，我不认为它有太多的意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a a danger that we are dumbing down things? Uh I mean, you you were talking about dumbing down in your book, how should we look at this? Yeah, I'm not big enough to categorize many things as fighting words, but that about does it for me. Dumbing it down, it's I find it to be really frustrating phrase because first and foremost, it belittles the hard work that it takes to make something clear that is actually complex to do or to understand. It takes a ton of work. And so to me, the dumbing down is leading provider, Mission critical, seamless, the stuff that you could just show up and throw up right now. It's it's a lazier form of communication, and I don't know that there's a ton of meaning in it.</p>
</details>

我认为我在这方面一直以来敬仰的英雄是**理查德·费曼**（Richard Feynman: 1965年诺贝尔物理学奖得主，量子电动力学专家，纳米技术和量子计算的先驱），这位伟大的物理学家，他因**量子电动力学**（Quantum electrodynamics: 描述光和物质相互作用的量子场论）获得了1965年诺贝尔奖。他是**加州理工学院**（Caltech: 美国顶尖的理工学院之一）的教授，是**纳米技术**（nanotechnology: 在纳米尺度上对物质进行操作和控制的技术）和**量子计算**（Quantum Computing: 利用量子力学原理进行计算的新型计算模式）的发明者。他是一位杰出的故事讲述者，善于运用想象力，他可能是类比大师，首先理解新事物，然后将其传达给他人。他运用这些技巧使他的思想、专业知识和知识更容易被更多人理解。没有人指责他“简化”事物，有趣的是，他的绰号是“伟大的解释者”，而不是“伟大的科学家”、“物理学家”、“思想家”或“发明家”。“伟大的解释者”，因为我们敬佩他将复杂事物变得清晰明了的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that one person I look to for all of this is a particular hero of mine from the communication standpoint is Richard Fan, the great physicist who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Quantum electrodynamics. He was a professor at Caltech, he's the inventor of nanotechnology in Quantum Computing. He was a tremendous Storyteller, use of imagine he was probably the master of analogies to first understand something new and then to communicate it to others. He used those techniques to make his ideas and his expertise and his knowledge more accessible to more people. No one ever accused of dumbing things down, and his nickname interestingly enough was the great explainer, not the great scientist or physicist or mind or inventor, the great explainer, because we revered him for his ability to make complex things crystal clear.</p>
</details>

这太有趣了，因为据说博士论文变得越来越复杂，越来越难以理解，然而像他这样的人却在做完全相反的事情。我认为我们都会陷入这种境地。我认为奇普·希思和丹·希思在历史上说得最好，他们称之为“**知识的诅咒**”（The Curse of Knowledge: 指专家在与非专家交流时，因过于熟悉自身领域而难以理解对方的视角和需求）。我们对自己的专业领域、主题、产品、业务了解得太多，以至于几乎忘记了对这个话题没有相同兴趣或专业知识是什么感觉。这种差距会使我们成为糟糕的沟通者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's so interesting because supposedly PhD dissertations are just becoming more and more complicated, less and less uh possible to understand, and yet somebody like that is doing the exact opposite. I think we all fall into this. I think Chip and Dan Heath have the best line in history when they called it the curse of knowledge. We know so much about what we know about our area of expertise, our subject, our product, our business that we almost forget what it's like to not have that same level of interest or expertise in that topic, and that Gap can make us bad communicators.</p>

你谈到了科学和论文。实际上，**意大利帕兰扎国家研究所**（National Research Institute in Palanza, Italy）的两位研究人员在2020年进行了一项有趣的研究，他们试图量化沟通这一软技能，并给出一些数字。他们研究了30年间21,000份**洞穴科学**（cave science: 研究洞穴形成、结构、生态和历史的科学领域）的科学手稿，试图确定手稿标题、摘要或全文中使用的行话数量与同行及科学界其他人士引用的次数之间的相关性。手稿是一种沟通工具，而引用当然是提高知名度和获取资金的方式。行话数量与文档引用成功率的临界点是1%。那些在标题、摘要或全文中使用了超过1%行话的文档，其引用次数急剧下降。而引用次数最高、排名最高的著作，在整个文档中使用的行话不到1%，甚至根本没有行话。所以，行话阻碍了一个潜在的伟大想法与它的受众之间。这很可怕，非常可怕。

<p class="english-text">You were talking about science and dissertations and things. There's actually an interesting study done in 2020 by two researchers at the National Research Institute in Palanza, Italy, and they were trying to quantify, put some numbers to this soft skill of communication. And so they looked at 100, no, 21,000 uh scientific manuscripts in cave science over a 30-year period, and they were trying to determine the correlation between the amount of jargon used in a manuscript title, abstract, or full document with the number of citations that it received from peers and others in the scientific Community. The manuscript is a communication to tool, the citation of course is the way that you drum up awareness and funding. The Tipping Point for the amount of jargon and the success of that document with citations was 1%. So those documents that in their title, abstract, or full manuscript used more than 1% of jargon, the citations dropped precipitously, and the highest ranked, highest cited works used less than 1% of jargon in the entire document, if any jargon at all. So the jargon stood between a potentially great idea and its audience. That's scary, that's very scary.</p>

### 重新思考PowerPoint的使用

安迪，你为什么讨厌**PowerPoint**？这个问题很直接。我想我们在书中可能也同样直接。我并不讨厌PowerPoint。我认为我们的听众有时讨厌我们使用它的方式。它太常被当作拐杖，阻碍了人们阅读屏幕上的内容。这里有一些2003年的统计数据：微软表示每天有3000万个PowerPoint演示文稿被交付。这太可怕了。我不知道2025年的数据是多少，但我可以保证不会比这少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Andy, why do you hate PowerPoints? That's very direct. I think we were probably that direct in our book. I don't hate PowerPoint. I think our audiences sometimes hate the way we use it. It does serve as a crutch far too often. It stands in the way. People might read what's on the screen. Here's a couple of Statistics from 2003. Microsoft said that 30 million PowerPoint presentations were delivered or every single day. That's terrifying. Now I don't know what the stat is in 2025, but I can guarantee it's not any less than that.</p>
</details>

平均每张幻灯片有40个词。我们的阅读速度是说话速度的三倍。所以，如果你在一张幻灯片上放40个词，当你在读第40个词的时候，我已经在读第13个词了。现在，背景音轨就断开了，我不会每次都等你赶上我。所以，糟糕的**PowerPoint使用规范**（PowerPoint hygiene: 指PowerPoint演示文稿的设计和使用习惯）会带来很多复杂问题。我认为你能做的主要事情不是消除PowerPoint，也不是说我讨厌它，永远不应该使用它，而是要思考这个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The average slide has 40 words on it. We can read three times faster than we can speak. So if you put 40 words up on a slide, I'm on the 40th word reading it while you're on the 13th word talking it through. Now the soundt track is off, and I'm not just going to wait for you to catch up to me each time. So there's just a number of complications for poor PowerPoint hygiene. I think the main thing that you could do is not to eliminate PowerPoint or not to say I hate it and I should never use it, it's to think about the process.</p>
</details>

所以，起点是我们应该消除PowerPoint，从大声说出来开始，从对着镜头开始，从你的知识开始，把它讲出来。当人们从PowerPoint开始，把所有信息、图表、文字和要点放在47张幻灯片上，然后回到第一张说：“现在我该对这张幻灯片说什么？”挑战就来了。到那时，你就陷入了**困境**（The Hurt Locker: 一部关于战争的电影，此处引申为困境）。PowerPoint正在主导叙述，你正在与它对话，它拖着你走，它控制着你。这与我们希望在“比赛日”发生的情况恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the starting point is when we should eliminate PowerPoint, start out loud, start on camera, start with your knowledge, talking it out. The challenge becomes when people start in PowerPoint and they put all that information and graphs and diagrams and words and bullet points on 47 slides, and then they come back to the first one and say, now what am I going to say to this slide? You're in The Hurt Locker at that point. The PowerPoint is dictating The Narrative, you're talking to it, it's dragging you along, it's got you in control. That's the opposite of what we want to have on game day.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你想在演示中加入PowerPoint或视觉效果，那会非常有帮助，因为有视觉学习者和视觉思考者。如果它支持你的叙述，那就太棒了。支持口头叙述的东西包括图片、数字，也许是五个词或更少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you want to inject PowerPoint or visuals into your presentation, and that can be very helpful, there are visual Learners, visual thinkers, if it supports your narrative, great. The things that support a verbal narrative are things like a picture, a number, maybe five words or less.</p>
</details>

### 有效的视觉辅助：超越幻灯片

一个PowerPoint演示文稿应该有多少张幻灯片？好问题。我认为挑战在于总幻灯片数量与每张幻灯片上的信息量之间的关系。我宁愿有一个20张幻灯片的演示文稿，每张幻灯片只有一个想法，一个概念，也不愿有6张幻灯片，却塞满了20张幻灯片的信息。所以对我来说，这更多地是关于每张幻灯片或每个视觉效果上有多少内容，而不是总数量，尽管总数量也必须纳入考量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many slides should a PowerPoint presentation have? Great question. I think the challenge comes into how many overall slides versus how much information on each slide. I would much rather have a 20 slide presentation with one thought per slide, one idea per slide, slide versus six slides with 20 slides of information jammed into it. So for me, it's less about the total number, although that is has to enter into the equation, and it's more about how much is on each slide or each visual.</p>
</details>

但你注意到，我们现在已经陷入了这样一个概念：幻灯片是唯一的演示视觉辅助工具。还有很多其他东西。首先，你就是视觉辅助本身，所以它必须从你开始，从你说话时的样子开始。但除此之外，还有实物道具、白板、活动挂图，还有许多其他你可以用来视觉辅助强大口头叙述的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this you notice we're we're already right now we're trapped in this concept of slides are the only presentation visual that could be there. Plenty of other things. First and foremost, you are the visual, so it's got to start with you and what you look like when you're saying it. But then there are are physical props, there are whiteboards, there are flip charts, there's many other things that you can use to visually uh Aid a strong verbal narrative.</p>
</details>

字体大小为什么如此重要？很简单，因为字体越大，你在一张幻灯片上能放的东西就越少。但我也看到，字体越大，你的可信度就越高，人们就越相信你的信息，越相信它更真实。我觉得这太有趣了。这真是令人着迷。所有这些关于大脑科学和大脑行为的小细节都会不断出现。我认为这是今天作为演示教练最酷的事情，就是科学终于赶上了沟通的艺术。我们正在更多地了解我们的听众如何通过人类认知行为来消费、处理和回忆信息。所以，我们应该尽可能多地采纳那些有充分来源和引用的信息，并在准备和交付演示文稿时加以考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is the font size so important? Very simply, because the larger the font size, the less stuff you can put on a slide. But I also saw uh uh the larger the font size, the more credible you become, the more people actually believe in your message and believe and believe it's more truthful. I thought I think that's so interesting. That is fascinating. There are all these little pieces of of brain science and brain behavior that that pop up. I think that's the coolest thing about being a presentation coach today is that the science is finally catching up to the art of communication. We're learning a whole lot more about how our audiences consume, process, and recall information just by human cognitive behavior, and so we should take as much of that that is fully sourced and referenced and consider it as we're preparing and delivering presentations.</p>
</details>

你建议我们进行一次“PowerPoint排毒”，比如30天不用PowerPoint。你认为这会如何运作？我非常喜欢任何能帮助我们最终提高沟通能力的强制性功能。聘请教练就像聘请健身私人教练一样。你应该经常见到他们，你应该总是有训练计划，你应该得到反馈、指导和批评，然后进行另一次重复。这就像在健身房里进行重复训练一样。有时，要达到我们作为演讲者的最佳状态，需要我们将其剥离到一种相当原始的训练方式。所以，这可能包括摆脱PowerPoint，以不同的方式准备。当你演示时，不要使用PowerPoint，看看这对你的演示者有什么影响。我敢打赌，这会促使人们更多地练习，更努力地准备，他们会在演示中变得更好，更具对话性。他们可能也会更加简洁。这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you suggest we have like a detox away from PowerPoint, like 30 days without PowerPoints. How how do you think that how does it work? I'm a big fan of any forcing function that helps us ultimately get better at communication. Hiring a a coach is like hiring a personal trainer for Fitness. You should see them often, you should always have a workout, you should get playback and coaching and critique and do another rep. It's about getting the rep in the gym, getting to a point where we're at our very best self as a presenter. Sometimes takes us to strip it back to a pretty raw workout. So it can be things like get rid of the PowerPoint, prepare in a different way. When you present, don't use PowerPoint, see what that does to your presenter. I bet you it will make people practice more, prepare harder, and they will be better, more conversational at that presentation. They'll probably also be a lot more concise. That's the first thing.</p>
</details>

另一种“排毒”是回到行话。我的儿子上了一所**阅读障碍儿童**（dyslexic children: 患有阅读障碍的儿童）小学。三年级时，他们已经解码了语言，开始重新编码，他们阅读更流利，取得了很大进步。现在，他们必须成为作家。所以，在他的作文课上，学习构建句子，使用语言、标点符号、语法。丽莎·利维尔是那里的老师。我曾经走进那个三年级教室，注意到她的白板上有一张词汇列表，标题是“我们不应使用的词汇”。对于一群三年级的阅读障碍儿童来说，这很酷、很好、很棒，还有类似的词，因为它们很简单，很懒惰，他们可以直接使用，而且使用得太频繁了，我们几乎从这些词中消除了意义。所以，这些词我们以后不会再用在句子中了。有更广阔的语言，让我们学习一些更精确、更具描述性的词汇。我过去曾与销售团队合作过，我们创建了一份在销售电话中“我们不应使用的词汇”列表，因为它太容易了，太常见了，太像其他人了。我们当时正在探索可以更具描述性和说明性的词汇，来表达他们所做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other kind of detox is is back to jargon. My son went to a school uh an elementary school for dyslexic children, and in third grade, they got to the stage where they had already decoded language, started to recode it, they're reading more fluently, making a lot of progress there. Now we had to become writers. So in his composition class, learning to construct sentences, use language punctuation, grammar, Lisa Lville was the teacher there, and I walked into that third grade class class Once Upon a Time and noticed on her whiteboard a list of words, and the title of the list of words was words we shall not use. And for a bunch of third grade dyslexic children, it was cool and good and neat and different words like that, because they were easy, they were lazy, they could go right to them, and they were used far too often, and we almost removed the meaning from those words. So these are words we're not going to use in our sentences anymore. There's a bigger broader language, let's let's learn some greater Vo vocabulary that can be more precise and more descriptive. I've actually worked with sales teams in the past where we created the list of words we shall not use in sales calls because it's too easy, it's too common, it's too much like everybody else, and we were exploring different words that could be more descriptive and more illustrative of what they do.</p>
</details>

### 最佳演示案例与给年轻沟通者的建议

你见过最好的演示是什么？我无法只选一个。我会告诉你，我认为**埃森哲**（Accenture: 一家全球领先的专业服务公司）的朱莉·斯威特是目前最好的商业沟通者之一，如果不是最好的话。她拥有如此强大的掌控力和沉着，她会讲故事，经常设置路标。例如，她可能会说：“在接下来的10分钟里，我将谈论两件事。”这样，听众就会始终知道他们在对话或演示中的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the best uh presentation you ever seen? I can't limit it down to just one. I me I will tell you that I think Julie Swe at Centure is one of if not the best business communicators going right now. She has got such command and Poise, she tells stories, she sign posts often, uh for example, she might say so over the next 10 minutes, I'm going to talk about two things, and so the audience will always know where they are in that conversation or presentation.</p>
</details>

不过，我喜欢引用的一个例子可能是你从未听说过的人，也可能是一家你从未听说过的公司。它是一家小型间接材料分销商，名为**MSC工业用品公司**（MSC Industrial Supply）。埃里克·格什温在我开始与他合作时是首席执行官，他现在仍然是首席执行官。他在2015年的**ARBA年度大会**（ARBA Live: 采购和供应链管理领域的年度大会）上发表了主题演讲。他以前从未做过外部演示，从未登上过舞台。他唯一做过的演示形式是销售推介、客户会议，也许是工作中的全体会议，但从未在聚光灯下，在3000名**首席采购官**（Chief Procurement Officers: 负责公司采购和供应链战略的高级管理人员）面前登上舞台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the ones that I like to site though is probably somebody you've never heard of and maybe a company you've never heard of. It's a small distributor of indirect materials, it's a company called MSC Industrial Supply. And Eric Gerswin was the CEO when I started working with him, he still is a CEO today, and he was given the keynote address or a keynote address at ARBA Live in 2015. And he had never given an external presentation before, never been on a stage. The only thing he had done to present, and it is a different form of pres presentation, a sales pitch, a customer meeting, maybe a town hall at work, but never on a stage in front of the big lights, in front of 3,000 Chief procurement officers.</p>
</details>

所以，埃里克·格什温在他的叙述上投入了60到90天令人难以置信的准备工作，试图找到他的开场白、他的总结、他可以用来阐明观点的故事，以及演讲主体中不同的章节，这样听众就能始终知道他们在哪里，我也可以用不同的方式来说明这个进展是如何发生的。我在每个章节中都插入了一个客户做得很好的例子，一个我有所启示的轶事。那是一次非常棒的演讲。他在第一次演示结束后走下舞台，后台第一个人对他说：“老兄，那简直是采购界的**TED演讲**（TED Talk: 一种以“传播思想”为宗旨的全球性系列演讲）！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the amount of work that Eric Gerswin put into his narrative was 60 to 90 days of incredible narrative preparation, trying to find what's my lead, what's my summarization, what's my story that I can use to illustrate it, what are the different chapters of the body of the talk so that the audience will always know where they are, and I can illustrate different ways of making this progress happen. And I tuck in each of those chapters maybe an example of a customer who's doing this well, an anecdote of time where something a revelation I had. It was a tremendous talk. And he walked off stage after this first presentation, and the first person backstage said to him, man, that was a TED Talk for procurement.</p>
</details>

于是他挺起胸膛，肩膀向后，走到ARBA展会的展厅。一个又一个来自观众席的首席采购官走到他面前说：“是的，你得帮我清理一下阁楼。”这直接来自他用来阐明他关于车库和阁楼之间主要观点的特色故事。这是一个极好的例子，说明一个人如何掌控当下，以及为了达到那个时刻所付出的所有努力。在舞台上，他们看起来就像是信手拈来，轻松自如，几乎像是即兴发挥，但背后却有大量的准备工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with his chest bowed up and you know his shoulders uh back, he walked to the ARBA trade show floor, stood at the MSC booth, and one Chief procurement officer after another from the audience walked up to him and said, yep, you got to help me clean up the attic. That was directly from his featured story to illustrate his main point about the difference between the garage and the attic. It's a tremendous example of somebody owning the moment and all of the work that it takes to get to that moment where they look like on stage that they're just making it happen, it's just at ease, it's effortless, they're almost looking like they're just winging it, but there's so much preparation that goes into that.</p>
</details>

最酷的部分是，几个月后，对我来说只是一个普通的随机日子，我收到了MSC工业用品公司市场部负责人的电子邮件，附件是一个视频。当我打开视频时，里面是埃里克的儿子，九岁的杰克·格什温。那是MSC的“带孩子上班日”，有人把摄像机对准杰克的脸，说：“开始吧！”他说：“你看不见的东西就无法修复。你知道吗？今天，你们公司内部有1450亿美元的间接材料，其中100%到70%永远不会被使用。那是1000亿美元的浪费！”他几乎一字不差地大声复述着他爸爸的演示文稿。他之所以能背诵下来，是因为他听他爸爸在家一遍又一遍地大声练习了几个星期。这就是成功的秘诀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the coolest part is the last thing I'll say, the coolest part was months later, it was some random day to me, and I get an email from the head of marketing at MSC Industrial Supply, and attached to it is a video. And inside the video, when I open it up, it's nine-year-old Jake Gershwin, Eric's one of his sons, and it's bringing your kids to workday at MSC. And somebody put a camera in Jake's face and they said, go. And he said, this, you can't fix what you can't see. Did you know that today there's $145 billion dollar of indirect materials inside of your companies, and 100 and 70% will never be used? That's 100 bill ion Dollar in waste. And he's giving his dad's presentation darn near word for word out loud. He knows it verba him because he heard his dad practicing it for weeks upon weeks out loud at home behind the scenes. That's what it takes.</p>
</details>

所以安迪，如果那是我们想要达到的目标，你对那些想要成为世界上最好的沟通者的年轻人或学生有什么建议？发挥你内心的记者精神。这种**记者思维**（journalist's mindset: 像记者一样思考，关注事实、故事和受众）非常重要，因为这是一个起点。我的主题是什么？好的，重点是什么？我的听众为什么会关心它？我们称之为“那又怎样？谁在乎？”的测试。这对他们意味着什么？他们为什么会关心？如果我必须用一句话来说，那会是什么？简而言之，这就是重点。去寻找能阐明这个观点的故事，从业务内部寻找，说明它为什么重要，我们为什么应该做得更多，做得好是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Andy, if that's where we want to get to, um what advice would you have for young people or students who want to become the best communicators in the world? Tap into your inner journalist. That journalism mindset is really important because it's a starting point. Point what is my topic? Okay, what's the point? Why would my audience care about it? Something we call the so what, who cares test? What does it mean to them? Why would they care? If I had to say it in one sentence, what would it be? In a nutshell, here's the point. Go hunt for their story that illustrates that point from with inside the business that says why it matters, why we should do more of it, what it looks like when it's good.</p>
</details>

思考你将对听众提出什么要求，或者建议他们做什么，在那些设置了路标的部分。我们需要做哪两件事才能实现这个目标？这有三个好处，或者我们可以保证两个结果。所以，从最重要的信息到最不重要的信息来思考。我刚才画的是记者每天使用的东西，叫做**倒金字塔结构**（inverted pyramid: 新闻写作中将最重要的信息放在开头，次要信息依次排列的结构）。这是一种从你的听众、客户或读者角度组织所有信息的方式，从最重要到最不重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Think about the different things that you're going to ask of your audience or recommend that they do on those signposted sections, what are the two things that we need to do to make this happen? There are three benefits of this or two outcomes that we can guarantee. So think about it from the most important information down to the least important information. What I just drew there was the thing that the journalist uses every day called the inverted pyramid. It's a way of organizing all of your information from your audience or your customer or your reader down, so it's most important to least important.</p>
</details>

这是我首先会考虑的事情。第二件事是准备。多大声练习。这是关于内化，而不是记忆。做到这一点的方法是多做练习。站起来，对着摄像机演示，如果没有摄像机，就对着镜子，对着手机上的备忘录应用。当你开车上下班、遛狗的时候，听听回放。你有时间练习这些，所以你只是在不断地将其融入你的习惯中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's one of the things I would think about. The second thing is that's the preparation. Do more practicing out loud. This is about internalizing, not memorizing, and the way to do that is get some reps going. Stand up and present it to a video camera, if you don't have that, to a mirror, into your memo app on your phone. Listen to it back when you're driving the car to work and back, walking the dog. You've got time to practice this, so you're just kind of baking it in.</p>
</details>

安迪，你把这一切都描绘得非常清晰响亮。非常感谢你帮助我们。期待保持联系，非常感谢你今天抽出时间。非常感谢，尼古拉。谢谢。
