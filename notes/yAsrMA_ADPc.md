### 破局者的演进路径：从深度学习专用芯片到模型底座

在人工智能的发展历程中，算力架构的演进往往决定了算法落地与产业规模的上限。**Naveen Rao**（Unconventional AI 联合创始人兼 CEO，神经科学博士与资深芯片架构师）是一位典型的离群创业者（Outlier Founder）。他的早期职业生涯始终贯穿着“如何创造智能机器”的核心命题——早年在英特尔等企业从事芯片工程，随后攻读神经科学博士以探索大脑机制。2014 年，他创立了最早专注于深度学习硬件加速的初创公司 **Nervana Systems**，并在被英特尔收购后担任其人工智能产品事业部负责人。2020 年，随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，算力基础设施的供需矛盾进一步加剧，他创立了 **MosaicML**，推动开源大规模模型训练的高效化与普及，并最终以约 13 亿美元被 **Databricks** 收购。

经历了两轮完整的深度技术创业周期后，Naveen Rao 明确表达了自己的技术世界观：他坚决反对“AI 毁灭论”（AI Doomerism），坚信 AI 是人类演进的下一个里程碑。但他同时指出，要实现真正通往通用人工智能（AGI）乃至超越人类水平的智能，现有的半导体计算架构已经无法支撑，必须在底层物理基底上进行范式革命。

Naveen Ralph, co-founder and CEO of Unconventional AI, which is an AI chip startup. >> Best known for building and [music] selling two deep tech companies. Naveen is kind of definitionally outlier founder. When I came there, we had about a $20 million business and it was, you know, 7 or 800 [music] million when I left. >> I don't think you really understand something until you can build it. >> Just because something is tried does not mean it's [music] wrong. >> I'm the opposite of an AI goomer. I think AI is the next evolution of humanity. We need innovation on the hardware substrate to actually build true intelligence. >> Please welcome Naveen Ralph. [music] Hey everyone, great to be here. Um, you know, switching gears a little bit to AI now, which you may have heard a little bit about. Um, it's super exciting to be at this conference specifically because as was said in the uh intro, I'm the opposite of a doomer. I think AI is one of the most transformational technologies that humanity's ever created and will enable us to get to that next level of evolution which I'm here for and uh this is sort of the anti-doomer conference. So, let's go. [laughter] Um, so before we get going, I'll tell you a little bit about myself. Um, you know, I'm it's kind of weird. I'm really right where I wanted to be my whole life. Uh this was me at about five or six years old, something like that. We had a computer very early on, so I'll date myself, but uh this was in 1978. We got a computer. This is probably in the early 80s. Uh learned to program when I was a little kid. I just thought it was like a puzzle. Um you know, learned to I became an electrical engineer. Um really because I enjoyed sci-fi and always wanted to think about how I could make a intelligent machine. And uh you know then after a career in uh building computers I went back to school and got a PhD in neuroscience and the idea was like let's go back to that thing how do we make computers intelligent and fortunately the whole world kind of moved in this direction. So you know, around uh 2014 I started a company called Nirvana. Um it was really the first AI dedicated chip company. Um at that point GPUs were kind of the prevailing way of doing this. And now you see, you know, a very nice video from Jensen up here like the largest company in the world a hardware company because of AI. So we were early on um I think I sold the company way too early uh to Intel but I uh I ran I started and ran the AI group at Intel. Um, after I was done with that in 2020, I actually started thinking about the next problem, which was how do we build bigger models like the large language models we talk about today. And it was about how do I build the infrastructure to build those models? And so we started pretty early on with MosaicML. We did a lot of cool things like MPT and basically demonstrated to the world that you could build LLMs for less than a million dollars and trained on open data and was commercially viable. So, that was acquired by Databricks in 2023.

### AI能耗之墙：兆瓦级电网与十亿级用户的算力死结

尽管深度学习模型的能力呈现指数级跃升，但支撑其运行的能耗危机正迅速逼近极限。目前全球仅有少数前沿实验室和超大规模数据中心能够负担万卡级别的集群开销，而**推理能耗**（Inference Energy Consumption: 运行预训练模型生成预测或文本所需的持续电力消耗）则是更加严峻的现实挑战。以 Google 披露的公开数据为例，其每月生成的 Token 总量已突破 3.2 拍（3.2 Quadrillion，即 $3.2 \times 10^{15}$）。若按业界基准假设每次生成一个 Token 消耗约 10 焦耳能量计算，仅支撑这一规模的推理月耗电量就高达 9 太瓦时（TWh，即 90 亿度电），折合持续功率约为 12.5 吉瓦（GW）。12.5 吉瓦相当于 10 到 12 座核电站的全负荷总输出，也等同于旧金山市日常电力需求的数十倍。

这种不可持续的能耗模型直接将 AI 锁死在高昂的访问成本与有限的计算可用性上。如果将服务对象从现有的几千万核心用户扩展至 10 亿甚至更多并发用户，全球电网容量与数据中心基础设施将在物理上彻底崩溃。更为关键的是，算力的极度昂贵扼杀了技术的大规模普及与实验探索空间——开发者不得不为了节约计算预算而反复权衡，而在个人消费设备、自动驾驶车辆及人形机器人等边缘硬件形态上部署真正的高智力模型更是天方夜谭。若无法在硬件底层带来 100 倍至 1000 倍的能效飞跃，AI 的演进必将撞上无法逾越的“物理能耗之墙”。

So, after that I was kind of left thinking like, what is the next thing? What do we do? And Mosaic was all about how do we take the existing computing and move it forward? How do we build better software to move the existing computing paradigm forward? And that gave us a lot of lift. It gave us, you know, hundreds of percent. But what is needed now is thousands of percent, not hundreds of percent. And we need that kind of change. So, the question is like, what is the big problem today? We all know that scaling these models requires thousands or tens of thousands of GPUs, and literally only four or five companies in the world can even afford to do that. That's crazy. That is a bad world. We don't want a world where, like, intelligence is completely, you know, centralized in a couple of hands. But beyond that, is the energy and the ability to actually serve these models. You can build a cool demo, but can you actually serve a billion users? That's what you need to do to build a product. So is energy really a problem? Uh I'm not sure how much everyone in this audience has thought about this but interestingly enough I'll give you some some data points here. This is one company. This is just Google. I'm using Google because Google has actually talked about this publicly. um per month they cross 3.2 quadrillion tokens. It's a crazy number. I never even I never think in quadrillions but that's the world we're in today. And if I just take 10 jewels per token of energy. That's approximately the state of the art today. It's somewhere between, you know, five and 10 jewels. That works out to 9 terawatt hours per month. It's equivalent to 12 1/2 gigawatts continuous power. That's about roughly 10 or 12 nuclear power plants just to power that one feature or whatever it is they're doing for 3.2 quadrillion tokens. That is equivalent to roughly San Francisco times 10 or maybe even 20. San Francisco city requires about half a gigawatt to a gigawatt of power continuously. So that's crazy. And that's just today. What happens when it's not a few tens of millions of people using it, but it's a billion people using it? And it's every single app that you're using. And that's really what drives this. And that's why people talk about data centers and gigawatts. And so, you know, this energy problem is actually very real and it limits our capability to build intelligence. And people are like, well, so what? It's just power. Power is cheap. Power is abundant. Well, you can't get that power everywhere. So power restricts where we can use compute. But compute is intelligence. So if compute is restricted, then that means intelligence is expensive. And intelligence is rare. And expensive intelligence means compute scarcity. You don't try crazy things. You don't play around with it. You don't do experiments. And basically you don't build it into form factors like robotics that are useful in the real world. So you actually end up in a world where things progress much slower. We actually need this capability to accelerate humanity. And when computing is cheap, we build crazy things. You know, look at the internet. Look at the app ecosystem. That only existed because computing became effectively free. And so we need to get back to that curve.

### 冯·诺依曼架构的物理税：生物智能的百亿倍能效反差

为了寻找能效突破的理论依据，Naveen Rao 将目光重新投向自然生物系统。生物学在物理层面上提供了确凿的降维打击证明：**人类大脑**（Human Brain）拥有约 860 亿个神经元，其运行功率仅为 **20 瓦**（Watts）左右——相当于一颗微弱的节能灯泡；而灵长类动物大脑在更小神经元规模下仅需 **1 瓦**。相比之下，当今主流智能手机的蜂窝基带芯片在搜索信号时的峰值功耗就已达到 2 至 3 瓦。大自然在极其严苛的热力学约束下，孕育出了具备连续感知、推理与决策能力的复杂智能系统。

之所以现代数字超级计算机需要消耗数以万计甚至数百万倍的电力，其根源在于**冯·诺依曼架构**（Von Neumann Architecture: 存储器与处理器分离并在两者之间频繁传输数据的经典计算机体系结构）以及**数字逻辑抽象**（Digital Logic Abstraction）所征收的高昂“物理税”。
* **数据搬运的物理损耗**: 1945 年人类发明 ENIAC 计算火炮弹道以来，数字芯片便确立了“计算单元”与“存储单元”严格分离的原则。在现代处理器中，超过 90% 的能量并非消耗在实际的数学运算（如矩阵乘法）上，而是浪费在晶体管之间将 0 和 1 的数字位（Bits）不断在内存、缓存与运算器之间长距离往返搬运的电容充放电过程中。
* **高频时钟与数字栅极的暴力对齐**: 数字系统为了追求时序的确定性与精度，利用高频时钟强行让数以百亿计的晶体管瞬间翻转。为了实现 8 位、16 位或 32 位的确定性精度，系统必须投入海量的物理硅面积与电能来屏蔽噪声和防止漏电。
* **抽象泄漏与物理本末倒置**: 过去半个多世纪，半导体行业依赖摩尔定律与抽象层（从物理材料到晶体管，再到布尔门、指令集，最终到达应用软件）获得了惊人的通用性。然而在物理现实中，世界本身是连续的、模拟的；用纯数字的离散比特来精确逼近现实世界，在能量利用效率上存在根本性的低效。

So, okay, great, that all makes sense, but can we actually do it? How do we build a better, more efficient computer? Well, biology actually provides some proof for us here. So the human brain, you may have heard this, runs on about 20 watts of energy. And what's even more remarkable to me is actually animal brain. So that red number is how many neurons are in the brain. And if you kind of scale it linearly down to like a a monkeykey's brain, it runs on one watt. To put that in perspective, the cellular baseband in your phone runs on two or three watts. If it's searching for a signal, it's pretty hot. And uh that monkey has visually guided locomotion. It can forage, it can learn things. It basically has intelligence. And it does that on one watt. That's crazy. It's pretty amazing. And uh biology proves to us that this is not a fundamental thermodynamic problem. It's that the computers we build are just inherently inefficient. So, why are they inefficient? Well, we use something called the von Neumann architecture. And von Neumann was a mathematician who uh basically posited, you know, we want to separate memory from computing. So you have memory on the outside. You have some kind of computing and you move bits back and forth. That operation creates a machine that just requires a lot of movement but it's very fast. We built computers to be fast. They were always faster than the alternative. Uh incidentally that computer in 1945 that was built called Eniac was built to do artillery trajectory calculation and it was built to do it faster than the alternative. The alternative were humans who actually did the calculations. Now the alternative is other machines. But we're kind of at the end of that road. We've optimized that machine for the last 80 years. And moving bits back and forth is inherently expensive. And worse yet, in order to make it fast, we rely on digital logic. Digital logic is like, we think of it as, you know, zeros and ones. We teach that in elementary school now. But zeros and ones is a lie. That's not the real world. That's a that's an abstraction we created as humans to understand how to build systems. And digital logic basically takes continuous real-world physics, which is continuous voltages and currents, and it pins it to a zero or one, high or low, true or false. That pinning, that non-linearity costs energy. And so when you do that billions of times a second, with billions of devices, you end up with gigawatts. And so that's the physical cost we pay for digital logic.

### 动力系统与4D计算：以非线性相变代替比特搬运

为了从根本上绕过数字冯·诺依曼架构的能耗陷阱，Naveen Rao 及其团队提出了**4D计算**（4D Computing: 将时间与相空间演化作为显式原生计算维度的模拟物理计算范式）。这一范式的数学底座是**动力系统理论**（Dynamical Systems Theory: 研究多智能体或多单元在简单局部规则相互作用下自发涌现宏观复杂行为的数学分支），类似于鸟群飞行或蚁群觅食——单个单元仅遵循极简的局部物理规则（如感应相邻个体相位），整个群体即可涌现出复杂的全局智能。

人类大脑的神经元与突触网络本质上也是由模拟非线性振荡器构成的连续动力系统。基于此，4D计算放弃了传统的离散时钟与比特搬运，直接在物理硅基上构建由微小**振荡器**（Oscillators）组成的网络。系统的工作机制呈现出独特的物理特性：
1. **状态空间轨迹演化**: 系统的计算状态不再表现为存储于高位宽寄存器中的数字矩阵，而是被映射为网络中振荡器之间的相位差与高维**状态空间轨迹**（State Space Trajectory: 动力系统在时间维度上经历的所有物理状态点所构成的演化路径）。
2. **条件收敛即计算结果**: 当输入特定条件（例如“生成一架飞机、一辆汽车或一只鸟的图像”，或对长文本进行序列建模）时，物理网络在毫微秒内自发经历物理相变，沿着特定的吸引子盆地演化并达到稳态。系统演化至终态的物理过程本身就是最终的推理输出。
3. **消除抽象税**: 4D计算不再在模拟物理与数字比特之间进行高频反向转换，而是将能量耗散限制在接近热力学朗道尔极限（Landauer's Principle）的水平，在芯片内部实现了存储与运算的原生完全融合。

So how does nature do it? Well, nature uses something different. It's called dynamical systems. And you've seen this in everyday life. You know, a flock of birds, you know a bird does a simple behavior. It looks left, looks right, and figures out where the next guy's going. And when they do that, they actually create these interesting flocking behaviors, this emergent behavior. And we see that with ant colonies. Ant colonies actually do intelligent things just by very simple rules. And uh this study is called dynamical systems theory. It's basically how I get these emergent properties from very simple behaviors of individual components. Our brain actually works this way. Our brain is not a computer in the von Neumann sense. It's a bunch of coupled nonlinear oscillators, neurons. And they basically interact with each other and give rise to this property we call intelligence, perception, thinking, learning. It's dynamic, it's continuous, it's probabilistic, and it processes information natively in time. That's the 4D part. In a normal computer, we chop time into pieces. We have a clock. That clock chops it into, you know, gigahertz intervals. And every interval you do an operation. In a dynamical system, time is continuous. It just flows. And information flows with it. And so, what we're doing at Unconventional AI is building a new kind of computer based on this principle. We call it 4D computing. It natively operates in time, using coupled oscillators to do compute directly in the physics of the device. We don't convert to digital and then back. We do the math in the continuous state space. And the output is the steady state or the trajectory of that dynamical system.

### 六个月流片验证与对齐热力学极限的宏伟愿景

作为一家仅创办于 2024 年 1 月的硬核半导体初创公司，**Unconventional AI** 展现了极高密度的工程落地执行力。团队在无完整预设建制的前提下，于当年 6 月 1 日即完成了首颗全自研物理芯片的原型设计并交付晶圆厂进行**流片**（Tape-out: 芯片设计完成并送交晶圆代工厂制造关键掩模与实体硅片的过程）。目前，该物理芯片已在其实验室完成回片封测，并成功输出了人类历史上首批由纯模拟动力系统架构计算机直接生成的实际图像，并验证了其在通用序列建模（Sequence Modeling）任务上的适用性。

在能效潜力与技术演进路线上，Naveen Rao 展示了清晰的路线图：
* **逼近朗道尔热力学极限**: 当前最先进的数字半导体工艺由于数字逻辑抽象的限制，距离物理学允许的能效极限存在多达 10 个数量级（$10^{10}$ 倍）的巨大差距。Unconventional AI 计划在未来三年半的时间内，将 4D 计算架构推至二维光刻技术的物理极限。
* **在能效比上超越生物智能**: 公司的长期技术终局是打破大自然生物脑的效率标杆，在同等算力下实现比人类大脑更高的能效比。这一突破将使兆瓦级的云端大模型算力被压缩至口袋级与设备端，不仅彻底消除对庞大电网与万卡数据中心的依赖，更将直接赋能自主人形机器人、具身智能及遍布物理世界的边缘计算终端。

So, we set out to build this. We started this company in January. We didn't even have a team, but we said we're going to build this first physical prototype and do it, you know, this year. And actually, we taped out the design, meaning we sent it to the fab uh in June on June 1st. The chip is back in our lab, and we actually have results from it. So, these are the first ever images generated from such a computer. Now, great, cool. But does it do anything useful uh beyond just um uh images? you can actually do any kind of a task like sequence modeling. You can do things like language modeling. You can do things like perception. What you're seeing here is um we call this state space trajectory. It's basically how the system evolves in time. You can imagine if you characterize the state of the system as all the phases of those oscillators um and then look at how it evolves through time and you basically condition that on the output. You say I want to generate an airplane or a car or a bird. It'll actually go through different state space trajectories. And so that's what that graph is showing. It's showing actual data from a chip that is doing compute in this way. And what does this mean in terms of energy? Well, today's computers are roughly 10 billion times away. That's 10 one with 10 zeros after it uh from that thermodynamic limit. We think in that three and a half years we can hit the the limits of 2D lithography. And the the overarching goal of this company is to beat biology. We want to make something better and enable you know compute everywhere including compute in new robotic um forms uh and things like this in the next uh decade or so. I think what'll be interesting is that we'll see the shift going from like big big data centers with gigawatts of power to actually putting intelligence in places where you have milliwatts or watts. And that changes the whole world.

### 产业范式重构：跨越从确定性KV缓存到连续动力学的生态鸿沟

在随后的现场深度对话中，核心讨论聚焦于如何推动既有软件生态完成跨范式迁移。当前以 Transformer 为代表的主流深度学习架构高度依附于特定工程技巧（如**KV缓存**（KV Cache: 大语言模型自回归生成中为避免重复计算历史键值对而维护的显存缓存机制）以及确定性矩阵乘法张量运算），整个产业已在数字加速硬件与软件栈（如 CUDA）上投入了数千亿美元。

对此，Naveen Rao 进行了深刻的工程哲学辨析：
* **抽象层的机械还原性与路径依赖**: 当前的软件栈是围绕冯·诺依曼架构的局限性而“被迫”设计的。KV 缓存本质上是为解决内存搬运瓶颈而设计的机械式补丁，而非认知智能的本质属性。人类大脑在进行长时间连续语言交流时，绝不存在所谓的“KV 缓存遍历”，而是依托网络内部持续演化的动态吸引子与连续时间物理机制。
* **向下兼容还是自上而下重塑**: 历史证明，当一种新计算范式的能效优势达到 100 倍至 1000 倍的断层级领先时，市场和学术界会自发重构算法与数学表征，以适配新的物理实体。4D 计算通过直接对接高维连续状态空间，提供了一种在物理层原生运行序列模型的新解法，正在将人类计算科学从半个世纪以来的离散抽象引向真正的自然物理对齐。

>> And do you expect that you'll have to move to support the existing model families and existing architectures? And will this work in a world where, you know, we've spent all of this time like, okay, KV cache and let's all like this all just so mechanically reductive based on, as you said, these abstractions that we've lived on, right? So how do you expect the rest of us to kind of move towards this? Because I mean I think you see that efficiency curve. We'd all want to get to the bottom of it, but right now the whole software ecosystem is built on top of these abstractions. >> Yeah, totally. So the short answer is no, we don't have to support KV cache because KV cache is a symptom of a broken abstraction. It's a way we tried to fix the fact that memory and compute are separate. In our system, the memory is the state of the dynamical system. It's already there. You don't have to cache it, load it, or move it. When you speak, you don't go look up a KV cache in your brain. Your brain has an ongoing trajectory of state that carries context forward in time continuously. And so by throwing away that broken abstraction and moving to continuous time and dynamical systems, we actually get rid of that overhead entirely. Now, in terms of the transition, software will have to evolve. But historically, whenever hardware provides a 100x or 1,000x improvement in efficiency, the software community moves very, very fast to meet it. People rewrite algorithms, people change architectures. When GPUs came along, deep learning was adapted to GPUs, not the other way around. AlexNet was written in CUDA to make use of the hardware. So we believe that when the physical efficiency is undeniable, the algorithmic layer will naturally converge towards the physics of the machine. That's incredibly impressive. It's so ambitious. Thank you very much. It's great to see you. Great to see you. Amazing. [music]
