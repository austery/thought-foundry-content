### 核心议题：阻碍勇敢的不是恐惧，而是盔甲

让我告诉你，这次对谈并不轻松，因为我们触及了一些艰难的领域。但我认为，我们所谈论的话题，其重要性无与伦比。因为阻碍我们在生活和工作中勇敢前行的，并非恐惧本身，而是当感到害怕时，我们为了自我保护而伸手去拿的那副盔甲。

那副盔甲让我们远离了爱、联结和我们的价值观。最艰难的工作，就是去意识到当我害怕时，我的盔甲是什么。

布琳·布朗 (Brené Brown) 是一位标志性人物，她在羞耻、脆弱和联结领域的世界级研究，启发了像皮克斯、谷歌和美国特种部队这样的组织去培养更强大的领导者，并帮助普通人释放他们的全部潜力。

<p class="english-text">Let me tell you, this has not been easy because we went to some hard places. But I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this. Cuz it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid.</p>
<p class="english-text">And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And the hardest work is being aware of what is my armor when I'm afraid.</p>

### 童年经历：塑造坚韧与超强觉察力的根源

我是一个第五代德州人，成长于一个相当功能失调的家庭。父母们用他们所知的一切，尽其所能地抚养我们。他们都来自非常、非常艰难的成长环境，其中包括贫困和成瘾问题。所以，你可能会想到的关于第五代德州人的许多刻板印象——坚强、不哭——都适用于我们家。我们被允许表达的情绪范围非常窄，要么是“生气”，要么是“还行”。愤怒是可以的，但悲伤或脆弱则不被接受。脆弱被视为软弱、可怕，会让你陷入危险。

我在家里和学校都感觉自己像个局外人，但我非常擅长解读人、解读情境。我想，后来有位治疗师曾说：“是的，那叫**超强警觉**（Hypervigilance: 一种对周围环境保持高度警惕以寻找潜在威胁的心理状态）。你处于超强警觉状态。”我能洞察周围的一切，知道正在发生什么，能迅速地将别人看不到的事情联系起来。家里有欢笑，也有爱，但同时也充满了巨大的不确定性。

<p class="english-text">I would say that I'm a fifth generation Texan. I came from a fair amount of dysfunction. Parents doing the best they could with what they knew. both coming from really really really tough upbringings that included you know poverty addiction and so probably a lot of the stereotypes you would think about fifth generation Texan tough don't cry we were allowed a very small continuum of emotions were approval you know or approved which were pissed off or okay like anger was okay but no you couldn't be sad really or vulnerability was not a thing. Vulnerability was weakness and scary and puts you in jeopardy. I felt like a real outsider at home and in school, but I was really good at reading people, reading situations. I think my I think a therapist somewhere along the way said, "Yes, that's hypervigilance.</p>
<p class="english-text">You're hypervigilant. You know, I can see everything around me. I know everything's going on. I can connect things very quickly that other people don't see." And there was laughter and there was love. But there was a ton of unpredictability.</p>
</details>

在我的家庭里，爱玩乐和坚强是非常受重视的价值观，这些是父母记分卡上的高分项。如果你有趣、随和，能射得准、吐得远、钓得好，车开得飞快，你就能得A。运动能力也备受推崇。但这些有趣的事情可能很快就会变得非常艰难。

作为家里的长女，我无疑扮演着保护者的角色。我的代号是“大姐大”，这虽是玩笑，却也并非玩笑。如果父母之间发生激烈争吵，我会去把所有弟妹带到我的房间，然后自己下楼去处理。我绝对是那个保护者。争吵偶尔会升级为肢体冲突，但更多的是情绪上的激烈对抗，比如尖叫和呐喊。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think yes, being funloving was very valued in my family and being tough. These were the values. These are these are on the parental scorecard. This is what got you an A. if you're fun, easy, you can, you know, shoot straight, spit far, fish well, like really drive fast. And so those things were very valued. Athleticism was very valued. Um, but those fun things could turn really hard very quickly.</p>
<p class="english-text">It's fun until you've had a parent eject ejected from a game for being so hard. And that was your father. Yeah.</p>
<p class="english-text">I definitely had a protector role as the oldest. I mean code named sister superior. It was jokingly but it wasn't joking. Like if things got hard between my parents and they would get in volatile fights, I would go get all my siblings, put them in my room. I'd go downstairs and handle it, you know? Like I was definitely the protector. physically volatile fights um on occasion but more emotionally volatile. Screaming and shouting. Yeah.</p>

### 爱、关系与自我价值的探索

我们结婚六个月后，我去看了一位治疗师，我说：“我做不到，我必须结束这段婚姻。”我们在此之前已经断断续续约会了七年。我说：“我必须离开。”她说：“这确实很难。我能看出这为什么行不通。”我当时对史蒂夫（Steve）产生了一丝辩护的冲动，问道：“你什么意思？”她说：“他喜欢你的程度，远超过你喜欢你自己的程度。这一定很糟糕。”

我当时就想，去你的，你被解雇了。但后来我一直在想，她是什么意思？她说：“和一个能看见你、真正了解你、并且如此爱你的人在一起，一定非常不舒服，尤其是当你还没有找到一种方式去看见并如此地爱自己。这肯定会令人不安。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">when we got married, six months after we got married, I went to go see a therapist and I said, "I cannot do this. I've got to get out of this marriage." And we had dated off and on for 7 years before we got married. And I said, "I got to get out." And she said, "I could th this is hard. I I could see how this is not working." And I was like, I had a twinge of defensiveness about Steve. And I said, 'What do you mean? And she said, he likes you so much more than you like you. It must be terrible.</p>
<p class="english-text">It's like, [ __ ] you, man. You're fired. I was like, I am so I thought, what? That's what I do. So if you I'm going to give you one of my tells. If I do a really highpitched what that means I'm that means I'm looking for my purse and I'm get I know where the door is. Um I I I just kept thinking what what do you mean? He said it's got it's got to be very com uncomfortable to be with someone who sees you and really knows you and loves you so much when you have not found a way to see you and love you so much. It's got to be disconcerting.</p>
</details>

她说得没错。我必须达到这样一个点，我对自己说，也许我应该像他喜欢我一样喜欢我自己，然后再做一个更好的决定，判断这段关系是否能继续下去。我的自尊心问题源于我的父母，他们用非常大剂量的羞耻感来教育我。很多羞耻感都与外表和是否有趣有关。

<p class="english-text">What an [ __ ] man. like, wow. And it was true. I had to get to this point where I was like, I maybe I should like me as much as he likes me and then make a better decision about whether this is going to work or not.</p>
<p class="english-text">Oh, cuz my parents parented with a very big heaping dose of shame. Oh, okay. So, if you accomplish something or you don't accomplish something, you're made to feel bad about it. Yeah. And a ton of it was about appearance, being fun.</p>

### 情感的贫乏：为何我们只能识别三种情绪

当你的成长环境中，“生气”或“封闭”是你仅有的两种情绪选择时，所有其他感受都必须被塞进这两个篮子里。在我的书《Atlas of the Heart》中，我写了87种我认为很重要的情绪，因为我们语言的局限就是我们世界的局限。

在过去15年的研究中，我们发现普通人平均只能准确识别并命名三种情绪：快乐、悲伤和生气。在我的家庭里，悲伤是不被允许的，那被视为软弱。所以你只能“生气”或“还好”。因此，当我感到害怕、悲伤、焦虑、失望或痛苦时，我表现出来的就只是愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you grow up and pissed off or shut down are your two emotional opportunities. Like there, you know, in Atlas of the Heart, I write about 87 emotions that I think are important to understand because the limits of our language are the limits of our world.</p>
<p class="english-text">When you have two buckets, then everything must go in those. And in fact, in our research over the last 15 years, we found the average person can accurately identify and name three emotions. Happy, sad, pissed off.</p>
<p class="english-text">And so in my family, sad was not an option. That was weakness. So you could be pissed or okay. So when I get scared, when I feel grief, when I'm anxious, when I feel disappointment, when I feel anguish, I'm just angry.</p>
</details>

### 权力的本质：统治、恐惧与残酷的循环

我认为我们接下来要谈论的话题，其重要性无与伦比。权力有多种形式，比如“共力”（power with）、“赋力”（power to）和“内力”（power within）。而那些使用“统治力”（power over）的人，其行事逻辑基于一种信念系统，即权力是有限的，就像一块披萨，如果我分给你一些，我自己的就少了。所以权力必须被囤积、保护，而不能分享。

理解“统治力”至关重要，因为当人们使用这种权力时，他们无疑在告诉你他们害怕什么。他们会利用人们的恐惧，给人们树立一个敌人来获取权力。如果你告诉人们：“我看到了你们的痛苦，我知道痛苦的根源，我能为你们解决它。”并且这个根源是一个容易识别的、与投票者不同的群体，那么你十有八九会赢。

这种权力模式在组织、政治团体乃至信仰社区中都普遍存在。它之所以特别危险，是因为为了维持这种权力，你必须周期性地对弱势群体施加残酷行为。你必须提醒人们，你有多大的能耐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this to be honest with you. when when you use power especially power over because there's multiple kinds of power. There's power with into and power within. So people that use power within to and power within work from a belief system that's completely different. We believe that power is infinite and can grow when shared. People who use power over work from a belief system that power is finite like pizza and if I give you any I have a deficit. So it's got to be hoarded and protected and not shared.</p>
<p class="english-text">Power over is really important to understand because when people are using power over, they're definitely letting you know what they're afraid of because that's what they're focused on and they're tapping into. And I think this is absolutely true. If you give people someone to dislike and blame for their pain and they look different than the people who are voting, you will win a 100 times out of 100.</p>
<p class="english-text">If you say, "I see your pain." I can tell you exactly the source of it and I can fix this for you. And the source of it is going to be easy to see. You're not going to see yourself in them.</p>
<p class="english-text">This is how it works in organizations. how it works in political, you know, how it works in faith communities. This is how power works in general. So power over is a very specific kind of power. And it's especially dangerous because in order to maintain it, you have to engage in periodic bouts of cruelty towards vulnerable populations. You have to remind people what you're capable of.</p>
</details>

在领导力中，有四种权力类型：“统治力”（控制或剥削他人）、“共力”（寻找共同点，建立集体力量）、“赋力”（给予他人自主权，认可其潜力）和“内力”（尊重差异和自我价值）。随着时间的推移，我们看到非常成功的模式是“共力”、“赋力和“内力”的结合——即协作力、共同创造力、自我意识和元认知。

“统治力”极难维持。从神经生物学上讲，我们并非为长期处于恐惧状态而生。如果我为你工作，而你用“统治力”来领导我，用我的工作、后果或降职来威胁我，那么神经生物学上，我要么会对它变得麻木，要么可能会变得过度常态化。但无论如何，你都必须时不时地做些什么来向我展示你到底能有多混乱和残酷，以提醒我恐惧是真实存在的，让我重新回到那种状态。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's four types of power in leadership you speak about. There's the power over, which is controlling or exploiting others. Power with finding common ground and building collective strength. Power two, which is giving others agency and recognizing their potential. And power within, which is honoring differences and selfworth.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think what we've seen be very successful over time is power with, power to, and power within. So collaborative power, co-creation power, self-awareness, metacognition, knowing yourself, knowing how you think and learn. So power with and power too. Power over is excruciatingly difficult to maintain.</p>
<p class="english-text">We're not neurobiologically hardwired to stay in fear for very long. So if I work for you, if I work for you and you're using power over to lead me, you're threatening me with my job, you're threatening me with my consequences, you're threatening me with demotion, one of two things is going to happen for me neurobiologically. I am either going to just become numb to it. Or I might get hyper normalized. But every now and then, you're going to have to do something that demonstrates to me how chaotic and cruel you can actually be. Like, you're going to have to engage in periodic acts of cruelty to remind me that the fear is real and to put me back in it.</p>

### 系统思维：在复杂世界中保持开放

我是一个**系统理论**（Systems Theory: 一种跨学科的研究方法，旨在理解一个系统——无论是家庭、组织还是社会——中各个组成部分如何相互关联和影响）的信奉者。我认为，如果你不理解系统理论，尤其是在领导一个组织时，你将会落后。因为组织内外的复杂性如此之高，我们需要一个框架来理解所有这些独立的系统是如何相互碰撞的。

一个健康的系统必须保持可渗透的边界，这意味着它必须允许反馈信息从其他系统流入和流出，以保持觉知。当世界变得复杂时，我们开始不想要反馈，因为复杂性太大了。于是我们开始关闭那些可渗透的边界。当一个系统的边界不再可渗透时，它就会萎缩。在萎缩的过程中，系统会变得自我参照：“我们好吗？我们很好。我们对吗？我们很对。我们走在正轨上吗？我们就在正轨上。”因为它不再渴望外部反馈，即使是艰难的反馈。

在今天的商业环境中，地缘政治现实、市场变化、人工智能……一切都太疯狂了。我们关闭不确定性和复杂性的倾向，正是对我们工作和生活所在的系统最大的威胁。我们不能再奢侈地选择自我保护、关闭城墙、升起吊桥、在护城河里放满食人鱼。我们必须保持边界的可渗透性，必须不断学习、猜测、反学习、再学习。

<p class="english-text">I'm a big systems theory. I'm a systems theory person. I think if you don't understand system systems theory, at least if you're leading an organization right now, you're going to fall behind because the complexity inside and outside of organizations is such that we need a framework to understand how all of these individual systems are bumping up against each other.</p>
<p class="english-text">a healthy system has permeable boundaries, meaning feedback is flowing in and out all the time. What happens when the world gets complex is we start not wanting the feedback. The complexity is too big. So we start shutting down those permeable boundaries. Well, what happens to a system where the boundaries are no longer permeable. It atrophies. And in the in the process of atrophying, the system becomes self-referencing. Are we good? We're great. Are we right? We're right. Are we on target? We're on target. because the boundaries of the system is are no longer craving outside feedback even when it's tough.</p>
<p class="english-text">And in businesses today, the geopolitical realities, the market changes, AI, I mean, it's crazy. And so our predisposition to shut down uncertainty and complexity is the biggest threat to the systems in which we work and live. the self-protect, close the wall, put up the drawbridge, fill the moat with piranhas. We just don't have that luxury. We've got to keep the the boundaries permeable. We've got to keep learning, guessing, unlearning, relearning.</p>

### 算法时代的精神危机与“思想阶层”的崛起

我们正处于一场精神危机之中。我们的情绪失调，彼此不信任，对自己也不太信任，并且相互疏离。但我无法放弃对人的信念，我不是那样的人。我就是相信，我们本性中的善多于贪婪。

我曾与特雷弗·诺亚（Trevor Noah）在一次活动中对谈，我提到了一个让我很兴奋的词：**认知主权**（Cognitive Sovereignty: 指个人有能力控制自己的思想、注意力和信息消费，而不被算法等外部力量操纵）。我们需要从算法手中夺回控制权，决定我们消费什么、阅读什么、如何思考，进行批判性思考。我们需要将我们的注意力和专注力视为商品，因为有人正在追逐它们。

但他提出了一个有趣的观点。他说：“不，布琳，我们需要更少的认知主权。”他解释说，现在所有东西都是“为你推荐”的页面，所有东西都是为你量身定做的。我们需要的是“社群主权”（communal sovereignty）。整个问题在于，你的“为你推荐”页面是完全主权的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Spiritual crisis. Yeah. I mean, you just laid it out. We're emotionally disregulated. We're distrustful of each other. We don't trust ourselves very much. And we're disconnected. I can't give up on people, though. I'm not built that way. Like, I just believe that we are more good than greedy.</p>
<p class="english-text">You know, I I was in conversation with Trevor Noah at an event and I mentioned this term that I I was really excited about and he challenged me on it and I said, I think what we need is cognitive sovereignty. We need to wrestle control away from the algorithms and decide what we consume, what we read, how we think, think critically. We need to think about our attention and our focus as commodities that people are after because they're after them, right?</p>
<p class="english-text">He had an interesting point though. He said, "No, we need less cognitive sovereignty, Brené." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "Everything's about the for you page. Everything's for you. We need communal sovereignty. He's like, you know, the whole problem is that your for you page is completely sovereign.</p>

最让我害怕的是，我有时会身处一些奇特的房间，因为工作的性质，房间里有运营这些平台的人，这些公司的创始人和CEO。我听到他们说一些极其矛盾的话，让我感到恐慌。比如，有人问一位科技亿万富翁：“我的孩子应该学什么？我为他们担心。”他会说：“他们应该学编程、物理。”五分钟后，仿佛刚才的回答从未发生过，又有人问他：“你认为你的成功深层次上归功于什么？”同一个人会说：“我深读哲学和斯多葛学派的著作。”

于是我开始思考，到底哪个才是答案？我开始推断，是否正在出现一个“思想阶层”？他们会想：“我们要读哲学，要读人文学科，要研究历史。至于你们其他人，继续刷手机就行了。别担心那些大词，我们会为你们处理好一切。”这就像有人问史蒂夫·乔布斯：“你的孩子一定很喜欢iPad吧？”乔布斯说：“我的孩子没有iPad。”他的传记作者也证实，他不是在开玩笑。他们家晚餐时没有科技产品，他们在谈论艺术和历史。

<details>

<p class="english-text">let me tell you what scares me the most. I'm in I'm in some weird rooms because of the nature of my job. I'm in rooms where the people who run these platforms and own and you know that own the CEOs of these business and the founders are in these rooms and I hear them talking and I hear things that are so misaligned that it panics me. So I hear someone say, "Hey, you know, tech billionaire, what what should my kids study? I'm worried for my kids." well they should study coding physics you know and then five minutes later as if that answer didn't happen someone will say to what do you attribute your success I mean deeply when you think about it and the same person will say my deep reading of philosophy in the stoics</p>
<p class="english-text">and so then I'm thinking to myself well which is it dude and then I then I start to extrapolate from there and wonder if there is a thinking class that's emerging where they're like, "We're going to read philosophy and we're going to read the liberal arts and we're going to study history and the rest of you just keep scrolling. Don't worry about the big words. We'll we'll handle all the big words for you." Like, it's like when they asked Steve Jobs, "Boy, your kids must love the iPad." Steve Jobs said, "My kids don't have an iPad." And then his biographer who spent time with his family said he wasn't kidding. There's no technology at dinner. They're talking about art and history.</p>

### 联结的真谛：从个体到超越性的归属感

我们从神经生物学上就被设定为需要与他人建立联结。在缺乏联结的情况下，总会有痛苦，永远如此。对我来说，联结是在一段关系中，我们既能给予也能接受，感到被看见、被倾听、被相信、被珍视的能力。这种人际联结在微观层面，即一对一的关系中，至关重要。

我认为归属感和地方感也很重要，这不一定是指一个地理位置，而是一种作为比自己更宏大事物一部分的感觉。爱与归属、联结，这些都是不可或缺的需求。

我将灵性定义为：通过某种比我们自身更宏大的事物，与他人密不可分地联结在一起。也许那是爱，也许是上帝，也许是钓鱼。对每个人来说都不同。对我而言，信仰是我的价值观之一，我是一个相当虔诚的信徒。我会问别人，那个能超越差异——政治差异、意识形态差异、种族、性别、信仰体系、阶级——的是什么？是什么让你回归到一个共同人性的地方？对我来说，是上帝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're neuro neurobiologically hardwired to be in connection with other people and in the absence of connection there's always suffering always suffering in the absence of connection. So to me, connection is the ability to be in a relationship where we can both give and receive, where we feel seen, heard, believed, valued.</p>
<p class="english-text">That is that human connection is really important on a micro level, one-on-one with other human beings. I think a sense of belonging and a sense of place. And I don't know that that necessarily needs to be a location, but A sense of being a part of something bigger than you I think is also important. So love and belonging, connection, irreducible needs.</p>
<p class="english-text">I I think spirituality I define spirituality is being inextricably connected to other people by something bigger than us. Maybe that's love, maybe that's God, maybe that's fishing. Like I I you know it's different for other people. For me, I'm faith is one of my values and I'm a a pretty serious God person. Um I'm a pretty deep person of faith. I guess I would ask somebody, what is that thing that transcends difference? Political difference, ideological difference, race, gender, you know, belief systems, class. What is it that brings you to a common humanity place? Like for me, it's God.</p>
</details>

### 真正的归属感：敢于独自站立的勇气

在我的书《Braving the Wilderness》中，副标题是“探寻真正的归属感与独自站立的勇气”。这看起来像是一个二元对立或矛盾：既要归属，又要独自站立。

因为我认为，如果你不首先归属于自己，你就无法真正归属于任何事物或任何群体。真正的归属感要求我们做自己，而不是改变自己去迎合。那是“融入”（fitting in）。融入是归属感最大的威胁。

为了融入，你背叛的第一个人就是你自己。我们必须能够独自站立。这就是当今世界正在发生的事情。我们在意识形态的掩体中进行大分类，我们会到达一个地步，我甚至不认识你，但我会称你为朋友，因为我们讨厌同样的人。而那边的人，我其实很爱你，你是我的家人，但因为我们信仰不同，你在我的生活中就毫无意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you talk about belonging, it's interesting in your book Braving the Wilderness, which I think the question is kind of summed up by the subtitle here. The quest for true belonging and the courage to stand alone. This appears to be a dichotomy or a contradiction. To belong, but also to stand alone.</p>
<p class="english-text">Because I don't think you can truly belong to anything or any or or any group if you don't belong to yourself first. True belonging requires us to be who we are, not to change who we are. That's fitting in. Fitting in is the greatest threat to belonging.</p>
<p class="english-text">The problem is that that chameleon kind of skill set means that in order to fit in, the first person you betray is yourself. We've got to be able to stand alone. And that's what's happening right now in the world. I mean, if I if I look back at Braving the Wilderness, that was maybe the only prophetic book that I think I've ever written. like that like like that. I don't think I'm prophetlike, but man, did I call what was happening in terms of the big sort into ideological bunkers where we're going to get to a place where I don't even know you, but I'm going to call you friend because we hate the same people. And you over there, I actually do love you. you're a family member of mine, but I'm not, you know, because we don't believe in the same things. You have no meaning in my life.</p>

### 脆弱的定义：通往勇气的唯一路径

脆弱是我们面对不确定性、风险和情感暴露时所体验到的情绪。我曾去布拉格堡与特种部队合作，我问士兵们一个问题：“给我一个你生命中关于勇气的例子，无论你亲眼目睹还是亲身经历，这个例子中完全没有不确定性、风险或情感暴露。”

没有人能回答。最后，一个年轻士兵站起来说：“我服役了三期。没有脆弱就没有勇气。”

所以，脆弱重要吗？如果我们想在生活中勇敢前行，它就至关重要。如果你做的事情没有任何风险、不确定性和情感暴露，那就算不上勇敢。如果你知道结局如何，那就不是勇气。勇气是当你无法预测结果时，仍愿意全身心投入。勇气是先说“我爱你”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's define it. Um vulnerability is the emotion we experience when we have when we are up against uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. So it was really interesting because I had a hard time helping people understand because there's we are so raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness that it took a trip to Fort Bragg working with special forces to ask soldiers a question. Give me a single example of courage in your life. One example that you've witnessed or you you yourself have done. One example of courage that did not require uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure.</p>
<p class="english-text">No one could answer it. Finally a young soldier stood up and said three tours. There is no courage without vulnerability. So is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives.</p>
<p class="english-text">If you're doing things in your life, in your work, and there's no risk, no uncertainty, and no exposure, then they're not brave. If you know how it's going to end, that is not courage. Courage is a willingness to show up and be allin when you cannot predict the outcome. Courage is saying, "I love you first."</p>
</details>

### 信任与脆弱：缓慢积累的“弹珠罐”理论

人们总是问我，信任和脆弱哪个先出现？是我先信任你，然后才变得脆弱，还是我先脆弱，然后才信任你？我认为这是一个非常缓慢的叠加过程。我们相互了解，我分享一点点。我不会一见面就说：“你好，斯蒂芬。这是我最黑暗、最可怕、最痛苦的创伤。”因为那种试探实际上是一种盔甲。

信任和脆弱是这样运作的：脆弱，信任，脆弱，信任，脆弱，信任。

我女儿艾伦上四年级时，有一天放学回家，她哭着说：“我再也不会相信任何人了。”她在课间休息时把一些秘密告诉了一两个朋友，结果回到教室后，全班同学都知道了，大家都在嘲笑她。

我立刻想到了她老师在教室里放的一个弹珠罐。当全班同学集体做出好的决定时，老师就会往空罐子里放弹珠，装满后大家就能得到额外的课间休息和派对。我对她说：“信任就是那个弹珠罐。”

每一次你和别人分享秘密而他们没有泄露出去，他们就得到一颗弹珠。每一次建立信任，当你想要分享非常私密的事情时，你会去找一个弹珠罐满满的朋友。这些弹珠是通过非常微小的举动赢得的：她记得我祖父母的名字，她在午餐时分给我半个座位，她在我生病时关心我。

信任是在日常的点滴小事中赢得的。它是在无数个“推拉门时刻”（sliding door moment）中建立的——在那些时刻，你可以选择建立信任，停下来说“怎么了？”，也可以选择建立背叛，假装没看见对方的痛苦。

<p class="english-text">people always ask me what comes first, trust or vulnerability. Do I trust you first, then I'm vulnerable, or am I vulnerable first and then I trust you? And I think it's a very slow stacking. We get to know each other. I share a little bit. I don't I don't share, hey, nice to meet you, Stephen. Here's my darkest, horrible, most painful trauma. You know, cuz that that is actually that kind of litmus testing is actually a form of armor.</p>
<p class="english-text">Vulnerability, trust, vulnerability, trust, vulnerability, trust.</p>
<p class="english-text">Ellen's in fourth grade, my oldest. She comes home from school. The front door closes. She slides down the door into a heap, sobbing. She shared it like very confidentially with one or two of her friends during recess. When she got back to the classroom, they had told everybody in her class, all 30 kids, everybody was laughing and pointing and making fun of her. And she said, "I will never trust anyone again."</p>
<p class="english-text">And her teacher at the time, Mrs. Bockam, had a mar a a marble jar. And when the team when the when the class would collectively make good decisions, she would put marbles in this empty jar, and when it got full, they'd have an extra recess and party.</p>
<p class="english-text">And so immediately what came to me, because I'm describing trust, which is a hard concept to a fourth grader. I said, "Trust is the marble jar."</p>
<p class="english-text">Every time you share somebody something with someone that's confidential and they don't share it, they get a marble. Every time you build trust, when you want to share something really private and personal, you look for a friend whose jar is full of marbles. And what was shocking to me is that Ellen was conveying that these marbles were being earned on these very small. She knew my grandparents' name. She gave me a seat to sit at. She checked on me when I was missing school.</p>
<p class="english-text">Gottman say trust is earned in small moments every day. He's like, "That's a sliding door moment. I can I have a choice in that moment. to build trust and stop and say what's going on or to build betrayal and pretend like I don't see her hurting.</p>

### 拥抱喜悦：克服对失望的恐惧

无论盔甲为何而穿，没有脆弱，你就无法体验生命中最有意义的经历。爱、归属感，以及最脆弱的人类情感——喜悦。

喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于当我们中的一些人接近它时，我们会“预演悲剧”（dress rehearse tragedy）来为失望做准备。它如此脆弱，以至于我们甚至不让自己感受喜悦，因为我们太害怕有人会把它夺走，我们会被失望一拳击倒。人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿为某事感到兴奋而冒险感受失望。

我们研究的人群中，唯一能真正持续投入喜悦的人，是那些将脆弱感引发的身体颤抖作为提醒，去感恩，在那一刻练习感恩的人。所以，感恩是喜悦的一个巨大促成因素。这不是天生的，而是一种训练。

<p class="english-text">regardless of why the armor is on, without vulnerability, you cannot access the experiences that are the most meaningful in life. Love. Belonging is vulnerable. The most the most vulnerable human emotion, joy.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joy is so vulnerable that when some of us get close to it, we dress rehearse tragedy to prepare for disappointment. Like it's so vulnerable that we don't even let ourselves feel joy because we're so afraid someone's going to rip it away and we're going to get sucker punched by disappointment.</p>
<p class="english-text">people choose to live disappointed rather than to feel disappoint. risk feeling disappointed and get excited about something.</p>
<p class="english-text">The only people that can really lean into joy consistently are people who use that vulnerability quiver as a reminder to be grateful to be able to practice gratitude in that second. So gratitude is a huge enabler of joy. Is that automatic or can one train that? No, it's a training.</p>

### 克服与成长：盔甲之下的真实自我

我没有“克服”旧的自己，我正在“克服中”。我克服了那种认为自己总有一天会“到达终点”的信念。我对自己拥有的新技能心存感激，这些技能让我更贴近我想成为的那个人、那个母亲、那个伴侣、那个领导者。

如果我们可以“修复”自己，再也不用与之斗争，那么我们对他人的宽容就会少得可怜，我们会变成暴君。持续的斗争会为他人创造一种同理心。

过去25年我研究中最大的发现之一或许是：阻碍我们在生活和工作中勇敢前行的，不是恐惧，而是盔甲。每个人都会害怕，害怕是正常的。危险的是，当我们害怕时，为了自我保护而伸手去拿的那副盔甲，以及那副盔甲如何让我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。

最艰难的工作，就是不断地意识到：我的盔甲是什么？当我害怕时，我抓住了什么？当我想保护我的自我价值感和自尊时，我抓住了什么？以及那东西有多沉重。

中年时期有一个重大的发展里程碑，那就是宇宙抓住你的肩膀，把你拉近，对你说：“我不再开玩笑了。他们给了你天赋，选择不成长去实现它们不是无害的，这有后果。你的盔甲正在碍事。你现在是个成年人了，你有不同的选择。放开那些不再为你服务的东西。”

<p class="english-text">No, I'm overcoming. I have not overcome. Yes. The belief that I will overcome anything. I have overcome the belief that I have overcome the belief that I will ever arrive. I am grateful for the skills that I have that are new skills that keep me more aligned with the person, the mom, the partner, the leader that I want to be.</p>
<p class="english-text">if we could fix it and never have to wrestle with it again, we would be so short on grace for other people that we would be tyrants. So, you think it it creates a form of empathy for others?</p>
<p class="english-text">I think the hardest is maybe one of the biggest findings of my research over the last 25 years is it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's armor. Everybody's afraid. It's okay to be afraid. What's dangerous is the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values.</p>
<p class="english-text">the hardest work is for me constantly being aware of what is my armor? What am I what am I grabbing for when I'm afraid? What am I grabbing for when I want to protect my sense of self-worth, my ego? Like, and and how heavy that [ __ ] is.</p>
<p class="english-text">this is the big developmental milestone of middle age which is kind of when the universe grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you really close and says I'm not [ __ ] around anymore. They gave you gifts. Choosing not to grow into them is not benign. There's a consequence for that and your armor is getting in the way. You're a grown ass person now. You have different choices. Let go of what doesn't serve.</p>

### 培养勇气的四个核心技能

勇气的反面不是恐惧，而是盔甲，是自我保护。我们研究发现，有四个可传授、可衡量、可观察的勇气技能组合：
1.  **识别并理解你的核心价值观。**
2.  **理解是什么阻碍你直面脆弱**，并建设性地驾驭它。
3.  **如何建立信任**，以及如何变得对自己极度值得信赖——即自我信任。
4.  **如何在失败和失望后重新站起来**。如何重置，如何在困境发生时管理好自己的反弹力。

我们已经带领来自45个国家的16.5万人学习了这套方法，并收集了所有相关数据。它经受住了过去五年所有复杂变化的考验，包括人工智能在组织层面的影响。

<p class="english-text">No, I think the opposite of courage is armor. I think the opposite of courage is self-p protection.</p>
<p class="english-text">the four skill sets of courage which are identifying and understanding your core values. I would love to do this exercise with you sometime. Um two, understanding what gets in the way of you wrestling with vulnerability, kind of owning it and moving through it constructively. Three, how to build trust and how to become super important trustworthy to yourself, selfrust. Because one of the first casualties of failure or disappointment or setback is we lose our our ability to trust ourselves, our ability to make good decisions, our ability to take care of ourselves. And the last one, which is my favorite because it can really I've seen it really change an organization is how to get back up after failure and disappointment. How to reset, how to be how to manage your own bounce when hard [ __ ] happens.</p>
<p class="english-text">So those are the four skill sets of courage. Again, evidence-based, observable, measurable, and teachable. We've taken 165,000 people through this work across 45 countries, collected data on all of it. It's so exciting. And it withtood all of the complex changes over the last 5 years, including AI, organizationally, because this is where we do our work.</p>
