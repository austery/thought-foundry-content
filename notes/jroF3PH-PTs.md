### 勇敢的代价：盔甲与恐惧

**主持人：** 您是收到最多邀请请求的嘉宾。

**布琳·布朗：** 让我告诉您，这过程并不轻松，因为我们触及了一些艰难的领域。但我认为我们再也不会谈论比这更重要的话题了。因为阻碍我们在生活和工作中勇敢前行的并非恐惧本身，而是我们在害怕时为了自我保护而穿上的那层盔甲。

那层盔甲如何让我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。最艰难的工作，就是意识到当自己害怕时，我的盔甲是什么。

**主持人：** 这是自动反应吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 哦，不，这需要训练。

**主持人：** 那我们就从这里开始吧。布琳·布朗是一位偶像级人物，她在羞耻、脆弱和联结方面的世界领先研究，激励了像皮克斯、谷歌和美国特种部队这样的公司，去培养更强大的领导者，并帮助普通人释放他们的全部潜力。准备好了吗？脆弱性重要吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 如果我们想在生活中勇敢前行，它就至关重要。但我们从小被教育，认为脆弱就是软弱。比如在我的家庭里，我们被允许愤怒，但悲伤不是一个选项。你必须坚强。所以当我感到害怕、焦虑、失望时，我只会表现出愤怒。因此，当你在一个不允许脆弱的环境中长大，这会让你陷入危险。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？喜悦。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿为某件事感到兴奋，去冒险被失望狠狠打一拳。没有脆弱就没有勇气，因为勇气是当你无法预测结果时，依然愿意全身心投入。

<p class="english-text">You are the single most requested guest. And let me tell you, this has not been easy because we went to some hard places. But I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this. Cuz it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And the hardest work is being aware of what is my armor when I'm afraid. Is that automatic? Oh, no. It's a training. So, let's start with that. Then, Brené Brown is an icon whose world-leading research in shame, vulnerability, and connection has inspired companies like Pixar, Google, and the US special forces to build stronger leaders and help the everyday person unlock their full potential. Ready? Is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. But we were raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness. Like in my family, we were allowed anger, but sad was not an option. You needed to be tough. And so when I get scared, when I feel anxious, disappointed, I'm just angry. And so when you're raised without vulnerability, it'll put you in jeopardy. Like, you want to know what vulnerability is? Joy. Joy is so vulnerable that people choose to live disappointed rather than to get excited about something and risk getting sucker punched by disappointment. Like, there is no courage without vulnerability because courage is the willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome.</p>

**主持人：** 哇，我以前从未这么想过。但你可以培养这些技能。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。我们已经带领 165,000 人完成了这项工作。其中包括如何建立信任。

**主持人：** 我听说过你的大理石罐理论。你能给我解释一下你的大理石罐……看你多兴奋？

**布琳·布朗：** 我知道。这就是我们如何向财富 100 强公司最高层的领导者传授信任的方法。这太棒了。

<p class="english-text">Wow. I've never thought about that before. But you can develop skills. Yes. We've taken 165,000 people through this work. That included how to build trust. And I've heard about your marble jar theory. Could you explain to me what your marble jar look how excited you are? I know. So this is how we teach trust to the most senior leaders in Fortune 100 companies. It's awesome.</p>

### 童年根源：在情感匮乏的世界里锻造过度警觉

**主持人：** 为了理解您所做的所有工作、您对世界的看法，以及您在许多方面作为一个“异类”的身份，我认为我可能需要先了解您最早的成长环境，您来自哪里，是什么塑造了您。

**布琳·布朗：** 我卡在“我是个异类吗？”这个问题上了。

**主持人：** 您当然是个异类。这应该不足为奇。我的意思是，如果看看您的成就，您的成就本身就是异乎寻常的。所以人们会假设，是某种因素造就了您的与众不同。

**布琳·布朗：** 我会说，我是第五代德州人。我来自一个相当失调的家庭。父母们用他们所知的一切尽力而为。他们都来自非常、非常、非常艰难的成长背景，包括贫穷和成瘾。所以，你可能会想到的关于第五代德州人的许多刻板印象——坚强、不哭——我们被允许的情感范围非常窄，要么是“愤怒”，要么是“还行”。愤怒是可以的，但你不能真的悲伤，脆弱是不存在的。脆弱是软弱、可怕的，会让你陷入危险。我在家里和学校都感觉自己像个局外人，但我非常擅长解读人、解读情境。我想，某个治疗师曾对我说：“是的，那是**过度警觉**（Hypervigilance: 一种增强的感觉敏感性状态，伴随着对威胁的夸大关注）。”

你处于过度警觉状态。你知道，我能看到周围的一切，知道正在发生什么。我能很快地将别人看不到的事情联系起来。家里有欢笑，也有爱。但也有大量的不确定性。

<p class="english-text">In order to understand all the work that you have done and the perspective that you have on the world and also who you are as a anomaly in many respects, I think it's probably important that I understand your earliest context, where you've come from, what shaped you. I'm stuck on an am I an anomaly? Of course you're an anomaly. Of course you're an anomaly. That that should be of no surprise to you. I mean, if you look at your outcomes, your outcomes are anomalous. So, one would assume that there's some form of something that made you an anomaly. I would say that I'm a fifth generation Texan. I came from a fair amount of dysfunction. Parents doing the best they could with what they knew. both coming from really really really tough upbringings that included you know poverty addiction and so probably a lot of the stereotypes you would think about fifth generation Texan tough don't cry we were allowed a very small continuum of emotions were approval you know or approved which were pissed off or okay like anger was okay but no you couldn't be sad really or vulnerability was not a thing. Vulnerability was weakness and scary and puts you in jeopardy. I felt like a real outsider at home and in school, but I was really good at reading people, reading situations. I think my I think a therapist somewhere along the way said, "Yes, that's hypervigilance. You're hypervigilant. You know, I can see everything around me. I know everything's going on. I can connect things very quickly that other people don't see." And there was laughter and there was love. But there was a ton of unpredictability.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我正想说，通常不就是这种不确定性才导致了过度警觉吗？是某种在你年幼时需要保持高度警惕的需求？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。是的。我的意思是，是的，在我的家庭里，爱玩乐和坚强是非常受重视的。这些是价值观。这些都在父母的记分卡上。如果你有趣、随和，能射得准、吐得远、钓得好，开得快，你就能得 A。所以那些事情非常受重视。运动能力也很受重视。嗯，但那些有趣的事情可能很快就会变得非常艰难。

**主持人：** 我看到一张您和您兄弟姐妹的照片，您紧紧地抱着他们，我想您提到过，从照片里能看到您眼中某种恐惧。您知道我指的是哪张照片吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 我在一张沙发上吗？一张 70 年代的黄色丝绒沙发？是的。我想起那张照片。我喜欢那张照片。但作为长女，我确实扮演着保护者的角色。我的代号是“大姐大”。这虽然是开玩笑，但也不是开玩笑。比如，如果我父母之间关系紧张，发生激烈争吵，我就会去把我所有的弟妹都带到我的房间里。然后我下楼去处理。你知道吗？我绝对是那个保护者。

**主持人：** 是肢体上的激烈争吵吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 偶尔有，但更多是情绪上的激烈。尖叫和叫喊。

**主持人：** 我父母也一样。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的，就是很吵。我整个童年，整个房子的背景音就是尖叫。如果你在尖叫声中长大，听着隔墙传来的尖叫声，你懂那种声音。所以，我想我是过度警觉、有保护欲、有责任感的，同时还带着一种“你最好小心点，因为我会保护我的弟妹”的态度。

<p class="english-text">I was going to say, isn't that typically what creates hypervigilance is some kind of need to be that aware when you're young? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think yes, being funloving was very valued in my family and being tough. These were the values. These are these are on the parental scorecard. This is what got you an A. if you're fun, easy, you can, you know, shoot straight, spit far, fish well, like really drive fast. And so those things were very valued. Athleticism was very valued. Um, but those fun things could turn really hard very quickly. There's a photo I saw of you and your siblings where you're clutching your siblings and I think you referred to it as you could see there was a certain fear in your eyes. Do you know the photo I'm referring to? Am I on a couch? Like a yellow velour couch like from the 70s. Yes. Yeah. I think about that picture. I like that picture. But there was definitely I definitely had a protector role as the oldest. I mean code named sister superior. It was jokingly but it wasn't joking. Like if things got hard between my parents and they would get in volatile fights, I would go get all my siblings, put them in my room. I'd go downstairs and handle it, you know? Like I was definitely the protector. physically volatile fights um on occasion but more emotionally volatile. Screaming and shouting. Yeah. Same with my parents. Yeah. Just loud. There's a background in my whole house for my whole childhood was just screaming. There was a Yeah, we had a lot of screaming and there's a certain like if you grew up with screaming, hearing screaming through a wall, you know that sound. And so, yeah, I'm sorry because I don't like to hear that about your childhood and I don't like to know that about my childhood, but there was a lot of screaming. And so, I think hypervigilant, protective, responsible with a dose of be very careful because I will protect my siblings.</p>

### 爱的悖论：从童年创伤到38年的伴侣关系

**主持人：** 那段经历如何改变了您年轻时对爱的看法？一定有影响，因为我对我的情况也有同样的感觉。我想我学到的教训是，爱就像一座监狱。因为是我妈妈在喊，而我爸爸是那个囚犯，他从不回应。所以，你看到一个女人对他喊上六七个小时，而他坐在那里，像个无生命的物体一样看着屏幕。我记得当时想：“哦，好吧。所以如果我长大了谈恋爱，我就会成为一个女人的囚犯。好吧，听起来不怎么吸引人。”如果你换个房间，她会跟着他。所以我像躲瘟疫一样躲避恋爱关系。直到 27 岁左右都做得很好。

**布琳·布朗：** 然后呢？

**主持人：** 然后有人翻过了那堵墙，修正了一些证据。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的，史蒂夫（Steve）翻过了那堵墙。该死。我们有过关于我们各自心墙的长时间对话，慢慢地，通过那些对话，我们之间的墙壁就崩塌了。我们现在已经在一起 38 年了。哇。是的。这是我一生中做过的最难的事，毫无疑问。伙计，没有比这更难的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and how did that change your model of love as a young person? It must have been because I mean I obviously feel the same way about about my situation. And um I think the lesson I learned was that love was like a prison cuz it was my mom doing the shouting and my dad was the prisoner and he wouldn't respond. So this you've got a woman shouting at him for six seven hours a day and him sat there like he's a like an inanimate object looking at the screen. And I remember thinking, "Oh, okay. So, if I get in a relationship when I'm older, then I'm going to be a prisoner to a woman. Okay? Doesn't sound doesn't sound appealing. And if you move to a different room, you'd follow him. So, I avoided relationships like the plague. I did well until about 27. And then what? And then someone got over the wall and corrected some of the evidence. Yeah. Steve got over the wall. Damn it. We had long conversations about our walls and and slowly through those conversations. We just those walls crumbled with each other and we've been together now for 38 years. Wow. Yeah. Um, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life bar none, dude. Nothing has been harder.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗：** 我们结婚六个月后，我对你说，对你而言，爱将意味着成为一个囚犯，必须封闭自己才能生存。对我来说，结婚六个月后，我去看了一位治疗师，我说：“我做不到。我必须离开这段婚姻。”我们在结婚前断断续续地约会了 7 年。我说：“我必须离开。”她说：“这很难。我能看出这行不通。”我当时对史蒂夫产生了一丝辩护心理。我说：“你什么意思？”她说：“他喜欢你的程度，远超过你喜欢你自己的程度。这一定很糟糕。”

我当时想，去你的，伙计。你被解雇了。我一直在想，你什么意思？她说：“和一个能看见你、真正了解你、并且如此爱你的人在一起，一定非常不舒服，因为你还没有找到一种方式去看见你自己、爱你自己。这肯定会让你感到不安。”

真是个混蛋，哇。但这是真的。我必须达到这样一个点，我对自己说，也许我应该像他喜欢我一样喜欢我自己，然后再做一个更好的决定，判断这段关系是否能继续下去。

<p class="english-text">when we got married, six months after we got married, this is, you know, you you said for you love was going to be being a prisoner. And having to just shut down to survive. Run away. Don't confront it. No conversations now. No. Um, for me, 6 months after we were married, I went to go see a therapist and I said, "I cannot do this. I've got to get out of this marriage." And we had dated off and on for 7 years before we got married. And I said, "I got to get out." And she said, "I could th this is hard. I I could see how this is not working." And I was like, I had a twinge of defensiveness about Steve. And I said, 'What do you mean? And she said, he likes you so much more than you like you. It must be terrible. It's like, you, man. You're fired. I I I just kept thinking what what do you mean? He said it's got it's got to be very com uncomfortable to be with someone who sees you and really knows you and loves you so much when you have not found a way to see you and love you so much. It's got to be disconcerting. What an man. like, wow. And it was true. I had to get to this point where I was like, I maybe I should like me as much as he likes me and then make a better decision about whether this is going to work or not.</p>

### 情感语言和自我价值的力量

**布琳·布朗：** 当你成长过程中，“愤怒”或“封闭”是你仅有的两种情感选择时，情况就是这样。在《心的地图集》（Atlas of the Heart）中，我写了 87 种我认为很重要的情感，因为我们语言的局限就是我们世界的局限。

当你的情感只有两个“桶”时，所有东西都必须放进这两个桶里。事实上，在我们过去 15 年的研究中，我们发现普通人能准确识别并说出的情感只有三种：快乐、悲伤、愤怒。

在我的家庭里，悲伤不是一个选项，那是软弱。所以你要么愤怒，要么“还行”。所以当我害怕、感到悲痛、焦虑、失望、痛苦时，我只会表现出愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you grow up and pissed off or shut down are your two emotional opportunities. Like there, you know, in Atlas of the Heart, I write about 87 emotions that I think are important to understand because the limits of our language are the limits of our world. When you have two buckets, then everything must go in those. And in fact, in our research over the last 15 years, we found the average person can accurately identify and name three emotions. Happy, sad, pissed off. And so in my family, sad was not an option. That was weakness. So you could be pissed or okay. So when I get scared, when I feel grief, when I'm anxious, when I feel disappointment, when I feel anguish, I'm just angry.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我脑子里有两个悬而未决的问题。您早些时候说您在学校或家里都格格不入，我不明白为什么。另一个问题是，治疗师说您不像他喜欢您那样喜欢自己，我也不清楚是什么让您不喜欢自己。

**布琳·布朗：** 我想离开我长大的地方。我想抛弃我所知的一切。所以我总感觉自己是个局外人。我不受欢迎，没有和橄榄球队的四分卫约会。那是我父母、祖父母、曾祖父母的梦想，你知道，你成为啦啦队长，和四分卫约会，然后得到一个农场。所以我觉得自己不可爱，不受欢迎，不被理解。而在家里，我不是个随和的人。我很焦虑，总是处于戒备状态。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's two sort of outstanding question marks in my head and they might be the same answer, but it's you said earlier on that you didn't fit in at school or at home, and I didn't understand why you didn't fit in at school or at home. And then the other thing that's still a question mark in my head is the therapist said to you that you well asserted that you didn't like yourself as much as he liked you. And I wasn't clear on what made you not like yourself. I wanted out of where I was raised. I wanted to leave everything I knew. And so I always felt like an outsider. I didn't didn't want to do I mean I wasn't popular. I wasn't dating a quarterback. That was a dream that my my parents and their parents and their parents, you know, you were you were a bearcadet and you dated a quarterback and you got a farm. So at I felt not cute, not popular, not understood. And then at home, I wasn't easygoing. I was an I was anxious. and and always ready.</p>
</details>

### 融入的幻觉与羞耻的痛苦

**主持人：** 关于自尊的问题，治疗师指出的您不像史蒂夫那样喜欢自己，那源于何处？或者说，这与之前说的有什么关联吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 哦，因为我父母用大量的羞耻感来教育我。

**主持人：** 哦，好的。所以如果你取得了成就，或者没有取得成就，你都会因此感到难过。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。而且很多都与外表有关，要有趣。是的，外表。你知道，用热卷发器做的大波浪金发。头发越高，离上帝越近。你需要坚强、强壮，能戴上棒球帽迅速出门，不需过多打理，同时你又需要像选美皇后一样。

**主持人：** 您还记得他们曾对您的外表进行过让您至今难忘的批评吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 我想是的。我的意思是，不仅仅是他们。我认为，要让年轻女孩和年轻女性不产生对自尊的威胁，这不仅仅是父母的事。这就像要求她们不要呼吸，因为空气有毒。就像来自四面八方的信息，你知道，时尚杂志，你读了会想：“哇，我长得不像这样。我怎么才能变成这样？”然后你会在身上涂满婴儿油，在头发上抹柠檬汁，下巴下垫上锡纸，尽可能多地晒太阳，因为我们当时不知道那会致癌。我们都穿那种需要用钳子才能拉上拉链的牛仔裤，因为它们太紧了。外表很重要。这里是德州，宝贝。

<p class="english-text">And the point about self-esteem, which the therapist sort of highlighted about not liking oneself as much as Steve liked you, where did that come from or is that related in some way? Oh, cuz my parents parented with a very big heaping dose of shame. Oh, okay. So, if you accomplish something or you don't accomplish something, you're made to feel bad about it. Yeah. And a ton of it was about appearance, being fun. Appearance. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, big blonde hair with hot rollers. The higher the hair, the closer to God. You needed to be tough and strong and throw on a baseball cap and get somewhere really quick, lowmaintenance, and you needed to be a beauty pageant queen. Do you remember them ever being critical of your appearance in a way that has stayed with you? I mean, I guess. I mean, I think not just them. I mean, like I think having young girls and young women, keeping them from developing threats to their self-esteem is not just a parental thing. It's like it's like asking them not to breathe because the air is poison. Like it's like every message from everywhere, you know, the fashion magazines, you'd read them and you think, "Wow, I don't I don't look like this. How am I going to look like this?" You know, and you'd lather yourself up with baby oil and you put lemon juice in your hair. You put tin foil under your chin, get as much sun cancer as you could cuz we didn't know, you know, like you you'd we all wore jeans that you had to put on with pliers with for the zipper cuz they were so tight. appearance mattered. This is Texas, baby.</p>

### 变化的世界：权力、恐惧与政治叙事

**主持人：** 您最终上了大学，虽然并非一帆风顺，但最终还是进入了大学。您在 2001 年成为一名研究教授，并从此身兼多职。您在 96 年到 2002 年间在休斯顿大学获得了社会工作博士学位。在过去的二十多年里，您专注于研究和理解人。我的第一个问题是，在您看来，过去二十年世界发生了怎样的变化？

**布琳·布朗：** 工会主义者会说，在任何伟大进步之前，都会有一次倒退。我认为，当你观察世界各地的政治政府，看看权力现在是如何被使用的，这会告诉你很多关于他们害怕什么的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You go off to university eventually, and not a straight line, but eventually you get into university. You become a research professor in 2001 and you've been a research professor and many more things um, ever since then. You get your PhD in social work at the University of Houston, Texas between 96 and 2002. And really for the last couple of decades, you've focused on research, understanding people. My first question is um how has your perspective on how has the world changed in those last two decades in your view? Unions would say before any great progression there is a regression and I think that when you look at various admin I know you have a very global audience when you look at administrations political administrations across the world and you look at how power is being used right now it will tell you a lot about what they're afraid of.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我最近和我的好朋友们有过一次对话。我们谈到，当前似乎能让人们当选的主流政治叙事是，如果你说那些有色人种是你生活中痛苦和苦难的根源。实际上是那些地位比你低的人，那些越过边境或乘小艇穿越英吉利海峡的人，正在毁掉你的生活。这似乎是在美国和英国赢得权力的一种非常有效的叙事方式。似乎当前动摇英美选举的核心叙事就是：那些船上的棕色人种或越过边境的人是你生活痛苦的根源。这似乎很管用，也似乎是获得权力的关键。所以当我想到权力和你所害怕的东西时，我脑海中闪过的就是这个。

**布琳·布朗：** 我不认为我们能谈论比这更重要的话题了。当人们使用权力，尤其是“凌驾于人之上的权力”（power over），他们肯定是在让你知道他们害怕什么，因为那是他们关注和利用的焦点。我认为这绝对是真的。如果你给人们一个可以厌恶和归咎于他们痛苦的对象，而且这些人看起来与投票的人不同，那么你百分之百会赢。

如果你说：“我看到了你的痛苦。我可以告诉你痛苦的确切来源，并且我可以为你解决这个问题。”而痛苦的来源将是显而易见的。你不会在他们身上看到自己。所以你谈论的那个叙事是一个完整的循环。当权者利用权力来解决他们害怕的问题。他们通过利用恐惧并给人们树立一个敌人来获得权力。

这就是它的运作方式。我在组织中花了 95% 的时间与高管和高级领导者共事。在组织中是这样运作的，在政治领域、在信仰社区中也是如此。这就是权力通常的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a conversation about how the leading political narrative at the moment that seems to be getting people elected is if you say those people with that skin color are the reason for the pain and anguish in your life. It's actually the people below you that are coming over the border or crossing the the English Channel on dingies that are ruining your life. And it seems to be like a really effective narrative to earn power both in the US and the UK. like the central narrative that is swaying elections it seems at the moment in the UK and the US is those brown people on that boat or coming over the border are the reason for the pain in your life and it seems to work and that seems to be the thing getting power so that's kind of what ran through my head when I had this idea of like power and what you're scared of. I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this to be honest with you. when people are using power over, they're definitely letting you know what they're afraid of because that's what they're focused on and they're tapping into. And I think this is absolutely true. If you give people someone to dislike and blame for their pain and they look different than the people who are voting, you will win a 100 times out of 100. If you say, "I see your pain." I can tell you exactly the source of it and I can fix this for you. And the source of it is going to be easy to see. You're not going to see yourself in them. so that narrative that you are talking about it is a full circle. People in power use power to address issues that they're afraid of. They gain power by leveraging fear and giving people an enemy. That's how this works. I mean I spend 95% of my time in organizations working with seauite leaders and senior leaders. This this is how it works in organizations. how it works in political, you know, how it works in faith communities. This is how power works in general.</p>

### 四种权力类型：从“凌驾于人”到集体力量

**布琳·布朗：** “凌驾于人之上的权力”是一种非常特殊的权力。它尤其危险，因为为了维持它，你必须周期性地对弱势群体施加残酷行为。你必须提醒人们你的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So power over is a very specific kind of power. And it's especially dangerous because in order to maintain it, you have to engage in periodic bouts of cruelty towards vulnerable populations. You have to remind people what you're capable of.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您在《坚实地基》（Strong Ground）中谈到了四种权力类型。有“凌驾于人之上的权力”（power over），即控制或剥削他人；“与人共有的权力”（power with），即寻找共同点并建立集体力量；“赋予他人的权力”（power to），即给予他人能动性并认识到他们的潜力；以及“内在的权力”（power within），即尊重差异和自我价值。那么作为一名企业领导者，如果我想要成功，您是说我需要远离“凌驾于人之上的权力”，并采纳这个列表中的其他权力类型吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。我认为我们看到长期以来非常成功的是“与人共有的权力”、“赋予他人的权力”和“内在的权力”。所以，协作的力量、共同创造的力量、自我意识、元认知、了解自己、了解自己的思维和学习方式。而“凌驾于人之上的权力”极难维持。

从神经生物学上讲，我们并非天生就能长时间处于恐惧之中。所以如果我为你工作，而你用“凌驾于人之上的权力”来领导我，你威胁我的工作、威胁我后果、威胁我降职，从神经生物学上讲，我会发生两种情况之一。我要么变得麻木，要么我可能会变得过度常态化，觉得这就是我工作的环境。但每隔一段时间，你就必须做一些事来向我展示你到底能有多混乱和残酷。你必须周期性地采取残忍行为，来提醒我恐惧是真实的，让我重新陷入其中。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So there's four types of power you you you speak about in um Strong Ground. Yes. There's four types of power in leadership you speak about. There's the power over, which is controlling or exploiting others. Power with finding common ground and building collective strength. Power two, which is giving others agency and recognizing their potential. And power within, which is honoring differences and selfworth. So as a leader of a business, if I want to be successful, are you telling me that I need to stay away from power over and adopt another power within this list of four? Yeah. I think what we've seen be very successful over time is a power with, power to, and power within. So collaborative power, co-creation power, self-awareness, metacognition, knowing yourself, knowing how you think and learn. So power with and power too. Power over is excruciatingly difficult to maintain. We're not neurobiologically hardwired to stay in fear for very long. So if I work for you, if I work for you and you're using power over to lead me, you're threatening me with my job, you're threatening me with consequences, you're threatening me with demotion, one of two things is going to happen for me neurobiologically. I am either going to just become numb to it. Or I might get hyper normalized. I might just like this is this is what I work in. But every now and then, you're going to have to do something that demonstrates to me how chaotic and cruel you can actually be. Like, you're going to have to engage in periodic acts of cruelty to remind me that the fear is real and to put me back in it.</p>

### 复杂世界中的系统理论：封闭边界的危险

**布琳·布朗：** 我是一个坚定的**系统理论**（Systems Theory: 一个跨学科的研究领域，关注的是作为一个整体的系统的性质，而不是其组成部分）信奉者。我认为如果你不理解系统理论，至少在当今领导一个组织时，你会落后。因为组织内外的复杂性如此之高，我们需要一个框架来理解所有这些独立系统是如何相互碰撞的。

为了让系统茁壮成长，它们必须保持可渗透的边界。这意味着它们必须允许反馈从其他系统流入和流出，以保持觉知。

一个健康的系统有可渗透的边界，意味着反馈一直在流入和流出。当世界变得复杂时，会发生什么呢？我们开始不想要反馈了。复杂性太大了。所以我们开始关闭那些可渗透的边界。那么，当一个系统的边界不再可渗透时，会发生什么？它会萎缩。在萎缩的过程中，系统变得自我参照。“我们好吗？我们很好。我们对吗？我们是对的。我们达标了吗？我们达标了。”因为系统的边界不再渴望外部反馈，即使反馈很刺耳。

在今天的商业环境中，地缘政治现实、市场变化、人工智能，我的意思是，这太疯狂了。所以我们关闭不确定性和复杂性的倾向，是我们工作和生活的系统面临的最大威胁。自我保护、关闭心墙、升起吊桥、在护城河里放满食人鱼。我们根本没有那种奢侈。我们必须保持边界的可渗透性。我们必须不断学习、猜测、忘却、再学习。

<p class="english-text">I'm a big systems theory. I'm a systems theory person. I think in systems theory I was trained in systems theory. I think if you don't understand system systems theory, at least if you're leading an organization right now, you're going to fall behind because the complexity inside and outside of organizations is such that we need a framework to understand how all of these individual systems are bumping up against each other. In order for systems to thrive and grow, they have to keep permeable boundaries. Meaning they have to allow feedback to flow in and out from other systems to be aware. A healthy system has permeable boundaries, meaning feedback is flowing in and out all the time. What happens when the world gets complex is we start not wanting the feedback. The complexity is too big. So we start shutting down those permeable boundaries. Well, what happens to a system where the boundaries are no longer permeable. It atrophies. And in the in the process of atrophying, the system becomes self-referencing. Are we good? We're great. Are we right? We're right. Are we on target? We're on target. because the boundaries of the system is are no longer craving outside feedback even when it's tough. And in businesses today, the geopolitical realities, the market changes, AI, I mean, it's crazy. And so our predisposition to shut down uncertainty and complexity is the biggest threat to the systems in which we work and live. the self-protect, close the wall, put up the drawbridge, fill the moat with piranhas. We just don't have that luxury. We've got to keep the the boundaries permeable. We've got to keep learning, guessing, unlearning, relearning.</p>

### 算法困境与“思考阶层”的崛起

**主持人：** 另一个增加的复杂性是算法的兴起。实际上，当我想到由人工智能驱动的算法时，它们会更擅长知道你想看什么，以便你花更多时间，消费更多广告。这意味着，可能给我看的最好的东西，要么是真正可怕的东西，要么是确认我已有的信念。

**布琳·布朗：** 百分之百是这样。

**主持人：** 一个做相反事情的算法，对普通人来说可能不是一种愉快的体验。它会引起太多的不协调和不适。

**布琳·布朗：** 但对民主大有裨益。

**主持人：** 是的，非常好。但对于经营企业和销售广告来说却很糟糕。所以任何采取这种方法的公司都会破产。这就是为什么我认为 TikTok 如此成功，因为它的算法……我不用 TikTok，但我听说它令人难以置信地上瘾。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的，但人们是受激励驱动的，对吧？如果你的股价暴跌，你就会被解雇。如果你不那么做，你就会失去地位和权力。

<p class="english-text">One of the added complexities is the rise in algorithms. And and actually when I think about algorithms that are powered by AI, they're going to be even better at knowing what you want to see so that you spend time, so that you consume more adverts, which means probably the best thing to show me is either something really fearful or to to confirm what I already believe. 100%. An algorithm that was doing the opposite probably wouldn't be an enjoyable experience for the average human brain. It would cause too much dissonance, too much discomfort, but great for democracy. Great. Yeah. Fantastic. But terrible for for running a business and selling ads. So any company that takes that approach will go bankrupt. This is why Tik Tok I think have been so successful is the algorithm is I don't use Tik Tok. So I have a Tik Tok account. I don't have the app on my phone. But um from what I hear is it's so unbelievably addictive. Yeah. But it's people are driven by incentives, right? And you your your share price is going to tumble and you're going to be fired. And you're going to lose your your status and your power if you don't do that.</p>

**主持人：** 即使是现在的人工智能，你知道我每次和这些专家坐在一起，都会碰壁，那就是，好吧，如果我们禁止美国人追求这种超级智能战略，那么俄罗斯和中国就会先到那里，然后不幸的是，美国最终会成为中国的法国斗牛犬。我无法反驳这一点。我说：“不，你说的对。”因为你将不得不从他们那里租用技术。它将如此强大，带来如此巨大的经济优势，以至于你将不得不从中国租用它。所以，好吧，我猜山姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman）确实需要继续努力，否则……所以这很复杂。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的，你刚刚把它说清楚了。我们情绪失调，我们互不信任，我们对自己也不太信任，而且我们是脱节的。但我不能放弃对人的希望。我的天性不是那样的。我就是相信，我们善良多于贪婪。

<p class="english-text">So even with AI now, you know what I I'm like, I've sat with all these experts and I keep hitting up against this wall, which is, okay, if we just banned people in the United States from pursuing this super intelligence strategy, then Russia and China get there first, then the United States, unfortunately, are going to end up being China's French bulldog. And actually, I can't refute that. I go, "No, you're right." Cuz we you'd have to literally lease the technology off them. It will be so powerful and give such an economic advantage that you will have to lease it off China. So, okay, I guess Sam Alman does need to crack on or else so it's complicated. Yeah. I mean, you just laid it out. You just laid it out. We're emotionally disregulated. We're distrustful of each other. We don't trust ourselves very much. And we're disconnected. I can't give up on people, though. I'm not built that way. Like, I just believe that we are more good than greedy.</p>

**布琳·布朗：** 我曾与特雷弗·诺亚（Trevor Noah）在一个活动上对话，我提到了一个让我非常兴奋的术语，他对此提出了挑战。我说，我认为我们需要的是**认知主权**（Cognitive Sovereignty: 指个人有能力控制自己的思想、注意力和信息消费，而不受算法或外部力量的操纵）。我们需要从算法手中夺回控制权，决定我们消费什么、阅读什么、如何思考、批判性地思考。我们需要把我们的注意力和专注力看作是人们追求的商品，因为他们确实在追求这些。

但他有一个有趣的观点。他说：“不，布琳，我们需要更少的认知主权。”我说：“你什么意思？”他说：“一切都关乎‘为你推荐’页面。一切都是为你。我们需要的是社群主权。”他说，整个问题就在于你的“为你推荐”页面是完全主权的。

让我告诉你最让我害怕的是什么。因为我工作的性质，我会进入一些奇怪的场合。我所在的房间里，有那些运营这些平台、拥有这些企业的人，首席执行官和创始人们都在。我听到他们谈话，听到一些非常不一致的东西，让我感到恐慌。我听到有人说：“嘿，科技亿万富翁，我的孩子们应该学什么？我为我的孩子们担心。”他们会说：“哦，他们应该学习编程、物理。”然后五分钟后，好像那个回答没发生过一样，有人会问：“你把你的成功归功于什么？”同一个人会说：“我深度阅读哲学和斯多葛学派。”

然后我就开始想，到底是哪个？然后我开始推断，是否正在出现一个“思考阶级”，他们会说：“我们要读哲学，我们要读文科，我们要研究历史，而你们其他人就继续刷手机吧。别担心那些大词。我们会为你们处理所有的大词。”这就像他们问史蒂夫·乔布斯：“天哪，你的孩子们一定很喜欢 iPad 吧。”史蒂夫·乔布斯说：“我的孩子们没有 iPad。”然后他的传记作者，花时间和他家人在一起的人说，他不是在开玩笑。晚餐时没有科技产品。他们在谈论艺术和历史。

<p class="english-text">You know, I I was in conversation with Trevor Noah at an event and I mentioned this term that I I was really excited about and he challenged me on it and I said, I think what we need is cognitive sovereignty. We need to wrestle control away from the algorithms and decide what we consume, what we read, how we think, think critically. We need to think about our attention and our focus as commodities that people are after because they're after them, right? He had an interesting point though. He said, "No, we need less cognitive sovereignty, Brené." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "Everything's about the for you page. Everything's for you. We need communal sovereignty. He's like, you know, the whole problem is that your for you page is completely sovereign. let me tell you what scares me the most. I'm in I'm in some weird rooms because of the nature of my job. I'm in rooms where the people who run these platforms and own and you know that own the CEOs of these business and the founders are in these rooms and I hear them talking and I hear things that are so misaligned that it panics me. So I hear someone say, "Hey, you know, tech billionaire, what what should my kids study? I'm worried for my kids." well they should study coding physics you know and then five minutes later as if that answer didn't happen someone will say to what do you attribute your success I mean deeply when you think about it and the same person will say my deep reading of philosophy in the stoics and so then I'm thinking to myself well which is it dude and then I then I start to extrapolate from there and wonder if there is a thinking class that's emerging where they're like, "We're going to read philosophy and we're going to read the liberal arts and we're going to study history and the rest of you just keep scrolling. Don't worry about the big words. We'll we'll handle all the big words for you." Like, it's like when they asked Steve Jobs, "Boy, your kids must love the iPad." Steve Jobs said, "My kids don't have an iPad." And then his biographer who spent time with his family said he wasn't kidding. There's no technology at dinner. They're talking about art and history.</p>

### 精神危机与对真正联结的追寻

**主持人：** 在您的工作中，贯穿着“联结”这个概念。我们生活在一个比以往任何时候都更孤独、在许多方面更脱节的社会中。您所说的“联结”是什么意思？它意味着个人层面上的朋友和关系吗？还是人们需要进一步提升到他们的城市、世界、社区，或者像上帝这样更宏大的事物？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。我认为这个问题的答案是“是的”。从神经生物学上讲，我们天生就需要与他人建立联结，而在没有联结的情况下，总会有痛苦。对我来说，联结是在一段关系中，我们既能给予也能接受，我们感到被看见、被听到、被相信、被重视的能力。这种人际联结在微观层面上，即一对一地与他人交往，非常重要。我认为归属感和地方感也很重要。

我认为灵性是，我们通过某种比我们自身更宏大的事物，与他人密不可分地联系在一起。也许是爱，也许是上帝，也许是钓鱼。这因人而异。对我来说，信仰是我的价值观之一，我是一个相当虔诚的信徒。我会问别人，那种超越差异——政治差异、意识形态差异、种族、性别、信仰体系、阶级——的东西是什么？是什么让你回归到一个共同的人性之地？对我来说，是上帝。我努力从一个信条出发，即在我遇到的每个人的脸上寻找上帝。即使我想一拳打在你的喉咙上，我也会努力去想，在某种程度上，我与你相连，无论我喜不喜欢，也无论我喜不喜欢你。

<p class="english-text">One of the things um per is throughout your work is this idea of connection. We live in a society that's more lonely than ever before, more disconnected in many ways as you describe when you're referencing the spiritual crisis that we're living in. This word connection, what does that mean? Does it mean on an individual basis? Does it mean me having friends and relationships? Is that connection? Is that the type of connection I should be looking for? Or does it need do I need to like do you think people need to ladder up further to their city, their town, their world, to the community, to something bigger, God? What what does connection mean in this context? Yes. I think the answer to that question is yes. We're neuro neurobiologically hardwired to be in connection with other people and in the absence of connection there's always suffering. To me, connection is the ability to be in a relationship where we can both give and receive, where we feel seen, heard, believed, valued. That is that human connection is really important on a micro level, one-on-one with other human beings. I think a sense of belonging and a sense of place. I I think spirituality I define spirituality is being inextricably connected to other people by something bigger than us. Maybe that's love, maybe that's God, maybe that's fishing. Like I I you know it's different for other people. For me, I'm faith is one of my values and I'm a a pretty serious God person. I would ask somebody, what is that thing that transcends difference? Political difference, ideological difference, race, gender, you know, belief systems, class. What is it that brings you to a common humanity place? Like for me, it's God. I try to work from an ethos where I try to find God in the face of everybody that I meet. Even if I want to punch you in the throat, I try to like like like that's my thing in some way. I'm connected to you whether I like it or not and whether I like you or not.</p>

### 独自站立的勇气：真正归属的意义

**主持人：** 您在《勇闯荒野》（Braving the Wilderness）一书中谈到归属感，副标题是“寻求真正的归属感与独自站立的勇气”。这似乎是一个二分法或矛盾：既要归属，又要独自站立。为什么这两者都重要？

**布琳·布朗：** 因为我认为，如果你不首先属于自己，你就无法真正属于任何事物或任何团体。真正的归属感要求我们做自己，而不是改变自己。那是“融入”。“融入”是归属感的最大威胁。

**主持人：** 这让我们都回到了我们的童年，对吧？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。融入，融入，融入。问题在于，那种变色龙般的技能意味着，为了融入，你背叛的第一个人就是你自己。我们必须能够独自站立。这就是现在世界上正在发生的事情。我们正在大规模地分化成意识形态的堡垒，我们会到达一个地步，我甚至不认识你，但我会称你为朋友，因为我们讨厌同样的人。

而你，在那边，我其实很爱你，你是我的家人，但因为我们不相信同样的事情，你在我的生活中就没有任何意义。我们已经到了这样一个地步，意识形态的堡垒变得如此危险。假设我们对移民有相同的看法。我们会躲在桌子后面，在我们的意识形态堡垒里说：“是的，我们是对的，那些家伙都疯了。”然后有一天，我会转向你，说：“你知道，我在想一件事，我们该如何解决从法国乘小艇过来的人的问题？因为我认为不解决这个问题是不行的，我们确实有就业问题和住房危机。”然后你就会说：“你出局了。”

我对你的关心，我与你的联结，完全取决于你不对我们在这里达成的任何共识提出质疑。那是虚假的联结。

<p class="english-text">And when you talk about belonging, it's interesting in your book Braving the Wilderness, which I think the question is kind of summed up by the subtitle here. The quest for true belonging and the courage to stand alone. This appears to be a dichotomy or a contradiction. To belong, but also to stand alone. Why are both of these important? Why is it important to belong? What does that mean? And and why is it also important to stand alone? Because I don't think you can truly belong to anything or any or or any group if you don't belong to yourself first. True belonging requires us to be who we are, not to change who we are. That's fitting in. Fitting in is the greatest threat to belonging. Which takes us both back to our childhoods, right? Yeah. Fit in. Fit in. Fit in. fit in. The problem is that that chameleon kind of skill set means that in order to fit in, the first person you betray is yourself. We've got to be able to stand alone. And that's what's happening right now in the world. I mean, if I if I look back at Braving the Wilderness, that was maybe the only prophetic book that I think I've ever written. we're going to get to a place where I don't even know you, but I'm going to call you friend because we hate the same people. And you over there, I actually do love you. you're a family member of mine, but I'm not, you know, because we don't believe in the same things. You have no meaning in my life. Like, it's like we have gotten to the place where ideological bunkers and those are so dangerous cuz here you and I like let's say let's say that we have the same belief around immigration. Um, so we're going to flip this table over and we're going to get behind it in our ideological bunker and we're going to be like, "Yeah, we're right." and these guys are crazy and y'all, you know. And then one day I'm going to turn to you and say, you know, one thing I'm wondering about is how are we going to solve the problem with the folks coming over in the dingies from France? Cuz I don't think we're going to be able to go without solving it because we do have an employment issue and a housing crisis. And then you go, you're out. My my care for you, my connection with you completely dependent on you not questioning anything we agreed to to back here. Well, that's counterfeit connection.</p>

### 播客的困境：在意识形态战场中航行

**主持人：** 我只是在想作为一个播客主持人，我在这里与各种各样的人坐在一起。所以三四天前卡玛拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）坐在这里，然后我会有一个右翼的人坐在这里。然后我们有米歇尔·奥巴马（Michelle Obama），然后是乔丹·彼得森（Jordan Peterson），然后是乔丹·彼得森的对立面。我只是在想，这在某种程度上也让我感到不属于任何地方，因为这相当罕见。地球上可能没有一个播客同时请过米歇尔·奥巴马和乔丹·彼得森。

**布琳·布朗：** 没有。

**主持人：** 是的。然后是卡玛拉·哈里斯。所以你会受到两边的攻击。

**布琳·布朗：** 哦，我的意思是，看，如果你没有收到来自极左或极右的威胁性言论，如果你没有同时收到两边的攻击，那你就没有做好你的工作。

**主持人：** 阿门。是的。

**布琳·布朗：** 句号。但这很难。哦，天哪，这令人心碎。它会让你心碎。它会提醒你为什么“独自站立”会出现在那本书的封面上。因为它会筛选，或者说缩小你的归属感，你真正的归属感，到一个非常小的人群。

And I was just thinking about how um how that's also kind of made me feel like I don't belong because that is quite rare. There's probably not a podcast on earth that has had both Michelle Obama and Jordan Peterson. No. Yeah. And then Kamal Harris after that. And so you get you kind of get attacked from both sides. Oh, I mean, look, if you're not if you're not getting threatening from the far here, the far left or the far right, if you're not getting both, you're not doing your job. Amen. Yeah. Period. But it's tough because Oh, God. It is heartbreaking. It will break your heart. And it will remind you of why standing alone is on the front of that book. because what it will do is it is winnow the right word? It will narrow your belonging, your true belonging.

**主持人：** 我完全理解像我这样的播客主持人最终会选择站队，因为人多势众有安全感。站在无人区不是你想待的地方。我知道我永远不会成功地让人们变得有细微差别，不会在我请来右翼嘉宾时就勃然大怒，或者在我请来左翼嘉宾时也勃然大怒。我只是想赢得与观众的这场战争，让他们也只是倾听。我知道你不同意这个人，但你能只是听听吗？因为我就是这么做的。

**布琳·布朗：** 不，不会的。我认为这真的很令人困惑。我唯一的底线是，如果你的信仰质疑我的人性，我可能不会和你对话。如果你的核心信仰是关于我是谁，或者其他人是谁，是去人性化的，那我做不到，因为那样我就为了一个关于细微差别的政治观点而背叛了自己。

### 勇气的定义：为何脆弱性至关重要

**主持人：** 脆弱性重要吗？因为现在有很多表演性的脆弱。成为一个脆弱的人对我的健康、幸福和未来重要吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 让我们先定义它。脆弱性是我们在面临不确定性、风险和情感暴露时所体验到的情绪。所以脆弱性是我的感受，是那种畏缩、尴尬的感觉。我曾去布拉格堡与特种部队合作，问士兵们一个问题：给我一个你生命中勇气的例子，一个你亲眼目睹或亲身经历的例子，这个例子不需要不确定性、风险或情感暴露。

没有人能回答。最后，一个年轻的士兵站起来说：“三次任务。没有脆弱就没有勇气。”所以，脆弱性重要吗？如果我们想在生活中勇敢，它就重要。如果你做的事情没有风险、没有不确定性、没有暴露，那它们就不是勇敢的。如果你知道结果会怎样，那就不是勇气。

勇气是当你无法预测结果时，仍愿意全身心投入。勇气是先说“我爱你”。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？就是先说“我爱你”。

<p class="english-text">is vulnerability important? Cuz there's a lot of performative vulnerability taking place in Is it an important thing for my health, happiness, my future to be a vulnerable person? Well, let's define it. Um vulnerability is the emotion we experience when we have when we are up against uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. So vulnerability is what I feel. It's the cringe, the awkward, the thing that I the emotion I feel in times of uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure. So it was really interesting because I had a hard time helping people understand because there's we are so raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness that it took a trip to Fort Bragg working with special forces to ask soldiers a question. Give me a single example of courage in your life. One example that you've witnessed or you you yourself have done. One example of courage that did not require uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure. No one could answer it. Finally a young soldier stood up and said three tours. There is no courage without vulnerability. So is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. If you know how it's going to end, that is not courage. Courage is a willingness to show up and be allin when you cannot predict the outcome. Courage is saying, "I love you first." That's you. You want to know what vulnerability is? I love you first.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 很多人经历过一些事情，让他们很难变得脆弱。我昨天和一个人聊天，她曾被欺骗，童年早期有依恋问题。当我问她经历过的事情时，她就封闭了自己。她说她觉得脆弱是一种她试图远离的亲密形式，因为她需要真正、真正、真正地信任一个人之后才会敞开心扉。这导致她们单身、孤独、不快乐。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。你说的 loaded with so many things。首先，脆弱性和信任之间有一种非常有趣的关系。人们总是问我哪个先来，信任还是脆弱性。我认为这是一个非常缓慢的叠加过程。我们互相了解，我分享一点点。我不会一见面就说：“嘿，很高兴认识你，斯蒂芬。这是我最黑暗、最可怕、最痛苦的创伤。”因为那种试探实际上是一种盔甲。

我要向你扔一些我们关系还远未建立到足以承受的东西。你会走开，然后我用这个来验证脆弱是危险的。不，不，不。我之所以退缩，是因为我们还没有建立起能够承受这个故事重量的关系。我们能从小处着手吗？脆弱性，信任，脆弱性，信任，脆弱性，信任。

I was speaking to someone yesterday who was cheated on bunch of attachment issues in their early childhood. And funnily enough, when I was talking to her about I was asking her questions about the things, you know, she'd been through whatever else, she just shuts down. And she told me that she finds vulnerability to be a form of intimacy that she tries to stay away from because she needs to really really really trust the person before she opens up. And that results in them being single, alone, unhappy, so on and so on. Yeah. I mean, I think there's there what you said was so loaded with so many things. So, first of all, there's the there there's this very interesting relationship between vulnerability and trust and how does that work? And people always ask me what comes first, trust or vulnerability. Do I trust you first, then I'm vulnerable, or am I vulnerable first and then I trust you? And I think it's a very slow stacking. We get to know each other. I share a little bit. I don't I don't share, hey, nice to meet you, Stephen. Here's my darkest, horrible, most painful trauma.

### 信任的缓慢叠加：大理石罐理论

**主持人：** 我听说过您的大理石罐理论。我这里有一个大理石罐。您能给我解释一下吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 我知道。这来自于我女儿艾伦（Ellen）四年级的时候。她从学校回家，关上前门，沿着门滑坐到地上，泣不成声。她说发生了一件难过的事，她在课间休息时非常保密地告诉了一两个朋友。当她回到教室时，她们已经告诉了班上所有的同学。每个人都在嘲笑她、指指点点。她说：“我再也不会相信任何人了。”

我立刻想到的回应是：“说得对，一个鬼都别信。你只要相信你妈妈就行了。”但那不是正确的做法，对吧？你希望孩子能与他人建立信任。所以我说：“信任真的很难。”她说：“我不懂。”当时她的老师博克姆夫人有一个大理石罐。当全班同学集体做出好的决定时，她会往空罐子里放大理石，当罐子满了，他们就会有额外的课间休息和派对。

所以我立刻想到，因为我正在向一个四年级学生解释信任这个抽象概念，我说：“信任就是那个大理石罐。”她说：“你什么意思？”我说：“每次你和别人分享机密的事情而他们没有泄露出去，他们就得到一颗大理石。当你想分享非常私密和个人的事情时，你会找一个罐子里装满大理石的朋友。你有大理石罐朋友吗？”她说：“今天和我分享的那些不是。”我说：“谁是你的大理石罐朋友？”她说：“汉娜（Hannah）和洛娜（Lorna）。”我说：“告诉我她们做了什么赢得了大理石。”

“哦，比如午餐时我拿餐盘晚了，没有地方坐，洛娜会挪过去，给我一半她的座位，然后我们就共享一个座位。还有一次我得了链球菌性喉炎，汉娜很担心我，她妈妈打电话说汉娜担心艾伦。但汉娜做的最重要的一件事是，有一天我外公外婆来看我的足球比赛，汉娜看到后说：‘天哪，你的外公外婆来了。’因为大家父母都离婚再婚了，我有八个，你知道，四对长辈。她记住了他们的名字。”

让我震惊的是，艾伦传达的是，这些大理石是通过这些非常微小的事情赢得的。这让我开始思考关于信任的文献。我立刻去查阅了戈特曼夫妇（The Gottmans）的研究。戈特曼夫妇说，信任是在日常的点滴小事中赢得的。信任是随着时间的推移，一颗一颗大理石慢慢建立起来的。这就是我们如何向财富 100 强公司的最高层领导者传授信任的方法。信任就是一个大理石罐。它是挣来的。

<p class="english-text">And I've heard about your marble jar theory. So, I got a jar of marbles. Um, could you explain to me what your marble jar? Look at how excited you are. I know. Um, so this comes you know where where is where where do I get my information? Ellen's in fourth grade, my oldest. She comes home from school. The front door closes. She slides down the door into a heap, sobbing. Oh my god, Ellen, are you okay? Are you hurt? What's going on? She says that something hard happened. She shared it like very confidentially with one or two of her friends during recess. When she got back to the classroom, they had told everybody in her class, all 30 kids, everybody was laughing and pointing and making fun of her. And she said, "I will never trust anyone again." And my response immediately to my in my mind was, "Damn straight, not a person. You trust your mama." And that's it. Like that was my response. But again, that's not the right thing to do, right? You want a kid who can develop trust with others. So I said, "Trust is really hard." She said, "I don't understand it." And her teacher at the time, Mrs. Bockam, had a mar a marble jar. And when the team when the when the class would collectively make good decisions, she would put marbles in this empty jar, and when it got full, they'd have an extra recess and party. And so immediately what came to me, because I'm describing trust, which is a hard concept to a fourth grader. I said, "Trust is the marble jar." She's like, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Every time you share somebody something with someone that's confidential and they don't share it, they get a marble. Every time you build trust, when you want to share something really private and personal, you look for a friend whose jar is full of marbles. Do you have any marble jar friends?" She's like, "Not the ones I shared with today." And I said, "Who are your marble jar friends?" And she said, "Hannah and Lorna." And I said, "Tell me something they do to earn marbles." Oh, well like if I get to my tray late at lunch and there's no place to sit, Lorna will scoot over and give me half her seat and then we just share one seat and I can sit at the table. And then the other day when I had strep throat, Hannah was worried about me. So remember her mom called and said, "Hannah's worried about Ellen. Why wasn't she at school?" But then the biggest thing that Hannah did was the other day and Opa, my parents, my mom and her her husband came to my soccer game and Hannah looked over and goes, "Oh my god, your ma and Opa are here." And I said, "Why was that a big deal?" And she goes, "Because everybody's divorced and remarried and I've got eight, you know, four sets of people." And she remembered their names. And what was shocking to me is that Ellen was conveying that these marbles were being earned on these very small. She knew my grandparents' name. She gave me a seat to sit at. She checked on me when I was missing school. And so it made me start thinking about the literature on trust. So I immediately go to the Gottman's. I read right off the bat where Gottman say trust is earned in small moments every day. trust is built slowly over time, a marble at a time. And that's how that's how we teach trust to the most senior leaders in Fortune 100 companies. That trust is a marble jar. It's earned.</p>

### 喜悦的脆弱性与感恩的解药

**布琳·布朗：** 无论盔甲为何而穿，没有脆弱性，你就无法体验生活中最有意义的经历。爱。爱一个人就是从你醒来到你睡着都处于脆弱之中。爱就是脆弱，对吧？最脆弱的人类情感，是喜悦。

喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于我们中的一些人接近它时，会预演悲剧，为失望做准备。它如此脆弱，以至于我们甚至不让自己感受喜悦，因为我们太害怕有人会把它夺走，我们会被失望狠狠打一拳。

人们宁愿活在失望中，也不愿冒险感受失望，去为某件事感到兴奋。

<p class="english-text">regardless of why the armor is on, without vulnerability, you cannot access the experiences that are the most meaningful in life. Love. To love someone is to be vulnerable from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed. To love is to be vulnerable, right? The most the most vulnerable human emotion, joy. Joy is so vulnerable that when some of us get close to it, we dress rehearse tragedy to prepare for disappointment. Like it's so vulnerable that we don't even let ourselves feel joy because we're so afraid someone's going to rip it away and we're going to get sucker punched by disappointment. people choose to live disappointed rather than to feel disappoint. risk feeling disappointed and get excited about something.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 这是自动的还是可以训练的？

**布琳·布朗：** 不，这需要训练。在我们研究的人群中，唯一能真正持续投入喜悦的人，是那些把脆弱的颤抖作为提醒，去感恩，在那一刻练习感恩的人。所以感恩是喜悦的一个巨大促成因素。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is that automatic or can one train that? No, it's a training. The only people that can really lean into joy consistently are people who use that vulnerability quiver as a reminder to be grateful to be able to practice gratitude in that second. So gratitude is a huge enabler of joy.</p>

### “成为”而非“克服”的终身旅程

**主持人：** 看来您已经克服了旧的布琳·布朗的各种特质。

**布琳·布朗：** 不，我正在克服中。

**主持人：** 正在克服中？

**布琳·布朗：** 不，我没有克服。

**主持人：** 您克服了什么吗？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。我克服了“我会克服任何事情”的信念。我克服了“我会到达终点”的信念。我很感激我拥有的新技能，这些技能让我更接近我想成为的那个人、那个妈妈、那个伴侣、那个领导者。但我时刻保持警惕，我努力保持清醒，知道当自己害怕时，我会变得很可怕，我很容易灾难化思考，这对周围的每个人都很痛苦，而且我不需要被喜欢，我只需要做我自己。

<p class="english-text">It appears you've overcome various traits of old Brené Brown. No, I'm overcoming. Overcoming? No, I'm not over I have not overcome. Have you overcome anything? Yes. The belief that I will overcome anything. I have overcome the belief that I have overcome the belief that I will ever arrive. I am grateful for the skills that I have that are new skills that keep me more aligned with the person, the mom, the partner, the leader that I want to be. But I I am mindful all the I try to stay very mindful that I am scary when I'm scared that I catastrophize very very easily and that's painful for everybody around me and I don't need to be liked. I just need to be myself.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 有些人可能会觉得这有点令人沮丧，知道他们也可能永远无法治愈自己迫切想要改变的部分。

**布琳·布朗：** 我不认为这在考虑范围之内，原因很美妙：如果我们能修复它，并且再也不用与之斗争，我们就会对他人极度缺乏宽容，我们会变成暴君。

**主持人：** 所以您认为这能培养对他人的同理心？

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。我的意思是，我不会……我有非常严肃的界限。我是一个非常有界限感的人。但当我看到某人以某种方式行事时，我会想：“我的内在混蛋看到了你的内在混蛋。我懂。我明白你在做什么。我不会容忍它。我会为此设定一个界限，但我不会真的因此评判你。只是那种行为在这里是不行的。”

<p class="english-text">Some people might find that somewhat demoralizing to know that they they too might never cure parts of themselves that they're desperate to change. I don't think that's in the consideration set for a very beautiful reason that if we could fix it and never have to wrestle with it again, we would be so short on grace for other people that we would be tyrants. So, you think it it creates a form of empathy for others? Yeah. I mean, like I'm not going to I have like really serious boundaries. I'm a very boundary person. But when I see someone behaving a certain way, I was like, "My sees your inner right here. I I get it. I get what you're doing. I'm not going to tolerate it. I'm going to set a boundary around it, but I'm not really judging you for it. It's just that behavior is not okay right here.</p>

**主持人：** 但您现在喜欢自己了。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。是的，我喜欢。我喜欢我正在成为的样子。

**主持人：** 对于任何不喜欢自己的人，要达到喜欢自己正在成为的样子的地步，需要做哪些工作？

**布琳·布朗：** 我认为最难的是……也许是我过去 25 年研究中最大的发现之一是，阻碍我们在生活和工作中勇敢的不是恐惧，而是盔甲。

每个人都会害怕。害怕是正常的。危险的是我们在害怕时为了自我保护而伸向的盔甲。以及那层盔甲如何让我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。所以我认为最难的工作是，对我来说，不断地意识到我的盔甲是什么？当害怕时我抓住了什么？当我想保护我的自我价值、我的自尊时我抓住了什么？以及那东西有多沉重。

在某个时刻，我必须穿上它，因为那是我成长过程中的生存之道。但这是中年的一个重大发展里程碑，就是宇宙抓住你的肩膀，把你拉得很近，说：“我不再开玩笑了。他们给了你天赋。选择不成长为它们的样子不是无害的。那是有后果的，而你的盔甲正在碍事。你现在是个成年人了。你有不同的选择。放开那些不再为你服务的东西。”我认为这是我们在中年必须努力解决的重大里程碑。什么东西不再服务于我们，并阻止我们成长为我们想成为的人。

<p class="english-text">But you like yourself now. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I I Yeah, I do. I do. I can I can I think I can say that pretty I like what I'm becoming. And for anyone that doesn't like themselves, what what work has had to go into getting to the point where you like what you be you're becoming? I think the hardest is maybe one of the biggest findings of my research over the last 25 years is it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's armor. Everybody's afraid. It's okay to be afraid. What's dangerous is the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And so I think the hardest work is for me constantly being aware of what is my armor? What am I what am I grabbing for when I'm afraid? What am I grabbing for when I want to protect my sense of self-worth, my ego? Like, and and how heavy that is. You know, at some point I had to wear it because that was survival for me growing up. But this is the big this is the big developmental milestone of middle age which you are squarely entering which is kind of when the universe grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you really close and says I'm not around anymore. They gave you gifts. Choosing not to grow into them is not benign. There's a consequence for that and your armor is getting in the way. You're a grown ass person now. You have different choices. Let go of what doesn't serve. And that is the big milestone I think that we have to wrestle with in midlife. What no longer serves that's preventing us from growing into who we want to be.</p>

### 勇气的四项技能

**主持人：** 在这个背景下，无论是作为领导者还是在其他环境中，要变得勇敢，您谈到了勇气的四个步骤。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。这是大约 15 年前出现的研究。勇气的四项技能是：

一，识别和理解你的核心价值观。

二，理解是什么阻碍了你与脆弱性搏斗，即如何建设性地拥有它并穿越它。

三，如何建立信任，以及如何变得对自己极其重要地值得信赖，即自我信任。因为失败、失望或挫折的首批受害者之一，就是我们失去了信任自己的能力。

最后一点，也是我最喜欢的，因为它真的能改变一个组织，那就是如何在失败和失望后重新站起来。如何重置，如何在困难发生时管理好自己的反弹力。

所以这就是勇气的四项技能。同样，它们是基于证据、可观察、可测量和可教授的。我们已经带领 45 个国家的 165,000 人完成了这项工作，并收集了所有数据。这非常令人兴奋。它经受住了过去 5 年所有复杂变化的考验，包括人工智能，在组织层面，因为这是我们工作的地方。

<p class="english-text">To be courageous in this context, whether it's as a leader or in another environment, you talk about these four steps to courage. You talk about it in strong ground. Yeah. This was research that emerged like 15 years ago. The four skill sets of courage which are identifying and understanding your core values. Two, understanding what gets in the way of you wrestling with vulnerability, kind of owning it and moving through it constructively. Three, how to build trust and how to become super important trustworthy to yourself, selfrust. Because one of the first casualties of failure or disappointment or setback is we lose our our ability to trust ourselves. And the last one, which is my favorite because it can really I've seen it really change an organization is how to get back up after failure and disappointment. How to reset, how to be how to manage your own bounce when hard happens. So those are the four skill sets of courage. Again, evidence-based, observable, measurable, and teachable. We've taken 165,000 people through this work across 45 countries, collected data on all of it. It's so exciting. And it withtood all of the complex changes over the last 5 years, including AI, organizationally, because this is where we do our work.</p>

### 关系建议：三个承诺

**主持人：** 您已经处在一段关系中比我长得多，但我们在很多方面有很多相似之处。我想知道，如果您能给我一些关系建议，让我的关系在未来 30 年里能维持下去。

**布琳·布朗：** 我只想先说，我认为治疗、伴侣咨询工作非常有力和有帮助。我认为戈特曼夫妇的工作真的……我们有时会一起读他们的作品。所以我认为那很有帮助。

我想最重要的三点承诺是：坚持出现。不要相信它应该很容易的鬼话。这将是你做过的最难的事。以及，寻求帮助。

这就是我们的秘诀：我们坚持出现。我们知道这不应该很容易，而且我们寻求帮助。寻求帮助，可以是向他求助，也可以是外部的。我们寻求外部帮助，我们阅读，我们尝试新事物。我们尝试新工具。我们只是……我们永远不想停止学习和努力为自己和彼此变得更好。

<p class="english-text">you have been in a relationship much longer than me, but we share a lot of similarities in many ways. I was wondering if um if you were to give me any relationship advice that might hold my together over the next 30 years. I'll just start by saying I think therapy couple's work is like so incredibly powerful and helpful. I think the Gottman's work is really like we read the Gotman's work together sometimes. So I think I think that's helpful. I think these are the three commitments. Keep showing up. Don't buy into the that it's supposed to be easy. It'll be the hardest thing you ever do. and ask for help. but the secret to us is we keep showing up. We know it's not supposed to be easy and we get help. And the help being you turn to him and ask for help or external. Well, well, we get external help, but we read, we try new things. Um, we try new tools. We're just We don't ever want to be done learning and trying to be better for ourselves and for each other.</p>

### 应对悲伤与照护

**主持人：** 您是如何处理悲伤的？

**布琳·布朗：** 嗯，别给我寄你的仇恨邮件，混蛋。但是，你知道，当她去世时，除了解脱，别无他物。

**主持人：** 我听过这个。我从没有听过有父母患有痴呆症并去世的人不这么说。

**布琳·布朗：** 是的。完全是解脱。我的意思是，在她去世的前一天，我想我们和她度过了一段非常重要的时光。悲伤的窗口是多年的。很早就没有打电话给她说：“哦，查理（Charlie）有个很可爱的约会对象。让我给你看看返校节的照片。”或者，“嘿，艾伦，你知道，考上了她的硕士项目。”那一切都消失了，每周都是如此。

I've never not heard that from someone that had a parent with struggling with dementia and passing. Yeah. It was completely relief. I mean, the day before she died, I think we had a really important time with her. the window of grief was just years of there. There was, you know, very early on there was no calling her to say, "Oh, Charlie got a really cute date. Let me show you the homecoming pictures." Or, "Hey, Ellen, you know, got into her master's program." That that all just went away just every week.</p>

### 结语：找到坚实地基

**布琳·布朗：** 这就是为什么，你知道，整本《坚实地基》的书，第一章里有一句话说，我浴室镜子的窗户上有一张便利贴，上面写着：“我宁愿成为健身房里最老的女人，也不愿成为养老院里最年轻的女人。”

因为我确实相信运动与痴呆症之间的联系。我照顾过我患有痴呆症的祖母，和我的妈妈一起。我的妈妈和祖母做了很多与我不同的生活方式选择。但整个“坚实地基”的比喻是，我去看一个教练。有一天他看着我说，他叫我布朗。他说：“找到地面，布朗。”我低头看，说：“好的。”他说：“不是地板，是地面。用你的脚，推向地面。用你的思想与你的身体连接。推向地面，然后告诉你的思想，‘你要用你的背阔肌。’”

我当时想：“好吧。”所以我照做了，我感觉到了它们，我开始在每次做举重时都低声说：“坚实地基。坚实地基。”

<p class="english-text">And so that's why, you know, the whole the whole strong ground book, there's a there's a sentence in the in the first chapter that said, I have a sticky note on my window on my mirror in the bathroom that says, I'd rather be the oldest woman in the gym than the youngest woman in assisted living because I do believe in the connection around exercise, you know, dementia. And I I took care of my grandmother with dementia with my mom. And my mom and my grandmother made a lot of different lifestyle choices than I've made. But the whole strong ground metaphor is that I went to go see a trainer. And one day he looked at me and he said, he called me brown. He said, "Find the ground, Brown." And I looked down. I said, "Okay." And he goes, "Not the floor, the ground. Take your feet, push in to the ground. Use your mind to connect with your body. Push into the ground and then tell your mind, "You're going to be using lats." And I was like, "Okay." So, I did it and I felt them and I started whispering every time I would do a weightlifting thing, "Strong ground. Strong ground."</p>
