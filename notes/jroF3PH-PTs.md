title: 布琳·布朗：我们正深陷一场无人承认的精神危机
summary: 著名研究学者布琳·布朗 (Brené Brown) 深入探讨了我们这个时代普遍存在的精神危机——一种由情感失调、互不信任和深度脱节构成的隐形流行病。她剖析了脆弱性与勇气之间的深刻联系，揭示了阻碍我们勇敢生活的并非恐惧本身，而是我们为自我保护而穿上的“情感盔甲”。通过系统理论、权力动态分析和“大理石罐”信任模型等概念，布朗指引我们如何在复杂世界中建立真正的归属感，并强调了卸下盔甲、拥抱脆弱是实现个人成长与有意义人生的核心课题。

阻碍我们勇敢面对生活和工作的并非恐惧本身，而是我们在害怕时为自我保护而穿上的盔甲。那副盔甲让我们远离了爱、联结和我们的价值观。最艰难的工作，就是意识到当自己害怕时，我的盔甲是什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And the hardest work is being aware of what is my armor when I'm afraid.</p>
</details>

如果我们想勇敢地生活，脆弱就至关重要。但我们从小被教导，脆弱就是软弱。比如在我的家庭里，我们可以生气，但悲伤是不被允许的选项，你必须坚强。所以当我害怕、焦虑、失望时，我只会表现出愤怒。在不允许脆弱的环境中长大，会让你陷入危险。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？喜悦就是。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿为某件事感到兴奋，去冒险承受被失望重击的可能。没有脆弱，就没有勇气，因为勇气就是，在无法预测结果时，依然愿意全身心投入。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. But we were raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness. Like in my family, we were allowed anger, but sad was not an option. You needed to be tough. And so when I get scared, when I feel anxious, disappointed, I'm just angry. And so when you're raised without vulnerability, it'll put you in jeopardy. Like, you want to know what vulnerability is? Joy. Joy is so vulnerable that people choose to live disappointed rather than to get excited about something and risk getting sucker punched by disappointment. Like, there is no courage without vulnerability because courage is the willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome.</p>

### 童年经历：在混乱中学会察言观色

我是一个第五代德州人，成长于一个相当失调的家庭。父母尽其所知，做了他们能做的最好的事。他们俩都来自非常、非常艰难的成长环境，其中包括贫困和成瘾。所以，你可能会想到的关于第五代德州人的许多刻板印象——坚强、不哭——都适用于我们。我们被允许的情感范围非常窄，要么是“愤怒”，要么是“还行”。愤怒是可以的，但你不能真正悲伤，脆弱更是不可能的事。脆弱被视为软弱和可怕，会让你陷入危险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a fifth generation Texan. I came from a fair amount of dysfunction. Parents doing the best they could with what they knew. both coming from really really really tough upbringings that included you know poverty addiction and so probably a lot of the stereotypes you would think about fifth generation Texan tough don't cry we were allowed a very small continuum of emotions were approval you know or approved which were pissed off or okay like anger was okay but no you couldn't be sad really or vulnerability was not a thing. Vulnerability was weakness and scary and puts you in jeopardy.</p>
</details>

无论是在家还是在学校，我都感觉自己像个局外人，但我非常擅长解读他人和情境。我想，后来有位治疗师曾说：“是的，那是**过度警觉**（Hypervigilance: 一种增强的感官敏感状态，伴随着对威胁的夸大关注）。”我能看到周围的一切，知道正在发生什么，能很快地将别人看不到的事情联系起来。家里有欢笑，也有爱，但同时也充满了巨大的不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I felt like a real outsider at home and in school, but I was really good at reading people, reading situations. I think my I think a therapist somewhere along the way said, "Yes, that's hypervigilance. You're hypervigilant. You know, I can see everything around me. I know everything's going on. I can connect things very quickly that other people don't see." And there was laughter and there was love. But there was a ton of unpredictability.</p>
</details>

在我的家庭里，爱玩乐和坚强是非常受重视的价值观，这些是父母评分卡上的高分项。如果你有趣、随和，能射得准、吐得远、钓得好、开得快，你就能得A。运动能力也备受推崇。但这些有趣的事情可能很快就会变得非常艰难。比如，乐趣会一直持续，直到你的父亲因为太过激动而被罚出赛场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think yes, being fun-loving was very valued in my family and being tough. These were the values. These are these are on the parental scorecard. This is what got you an A. if you're fun, easy, you can, you know, shoot straight, spit far, fish well, like really drive fast. And so those things were very valued. Athleticism was very valued. Um, but those fun things could turn really hard very quickly. It's fun until you've had a parent ejected from a game for being so hard. And that was your father.</p>
</details>

作为家里的长女，我确实扮演着保护者的角色。我的代号是“优越大姐”，这虽是玩笑，但也不全是玩笑。如果父母之间发生激烈争吵，我会把所有弟妹带到我的房间，然后自己下楼去处理。我绝对是那个保护者。争吵偶尔会升级为肢体冲突，但更多的是情绪上的激烈对抗，比如尖叫和大喊。如果你在充满尖叫声的环境中长大，你就会知道隔墙听到的那种声音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I definitely had a protector role as the oldest. I mean code named sister superior. It was jokingly but it wasn't joking. Like if things got hard between my parents and they would get in volatile fights, I would go get all my siblings, put them in my room. I'd go downstairs and handle it, you know? Like I was definitely the protector. physically volatile fights um on occasion but more emotionally volatile. Screaming and shouting. Yeah. We had a lot of screaming and there's a certain like if you grew up with screaming, hearing screaming through a wall, you know that sound.</p>
</details>

所以，我的童年标签是：过度警觉、保护欲强、有责任感，同时还带着一种“你最好小心点，因为我会保护我的弟妹”的警惕。

<p class="english-text">And so, I think hypervigilant, protective, responsible with a dose of be very careful because I will protect my siblings.</p>

### 爱的模型：当亲密关系成为一座围城

主持人分享说，他童年时观察到母亲对父亲大喊大叫，而父亲则默默忍受，这让他觉得爱就像一座监狱，导致他长期回避亲密关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The lesson I learned was that love was like a prison cuz it was my mom doing the shouting and my dad was the prisoner and he wouldn't respond. So this you've got a woman shouting at him for six seven hours a day and him sat there like he's a like an inanimate object looking at the screen. And I remember thinking, "Oh, okay. So, if I get in a relationship when I'm older, then I'm going to be a prisoner to a woman. Okay? Doesn't sound doesn't sound appealing." And if you move to a different room, you'd follow him. So, I avoided relationships like the plague.</p>
</details>

我的丈夫史蒂夫也翻越了我的心墙。但那就像是“英雄识英雄”，他也有自己的心墙。我们曾就各自的心墙进行过长时间的对话，在这些对话中，那些墙壁在彼此面前慢慢瓦解了。我们在一起已经38年了，这是我一生中做过的最艰难的事，毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Steve got over the wall. Damn it. Um, but it was like game game recognizes game. He had a wall. Yeah. Uh, and so we had long conversations about our walls and and slowly through those conversations. We just those walls crumbled with each other and we've been together now for 38 years. Yeah. Um, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life bar none, dude. Nothing has been harder.</p>
</details>

结婚六个月后，我去看了一位治疗师，我说：“我做不到，我必须离开这段婚姻。”我们结婚前断断续续交往了七年。治疗师说：“这确实很难。我能看出这行不通。”我当时对史蒂夫产生了一丝维护之情，问道：“你什么意思？”她说：“他喜欢你的程度，远超过你喜欢你自己的程度。这一定很糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we got married, six months after we got married, I went to go see a therapist and I said, "I cannot do this. I've got to get out of this marriage." And we had dated off and on for 7 years before we got married. And I said, "I got to get out." And she said, "I could th this is hard. I I could see how this is not working." And I was like, I had a twinge of defensiveness about Steve. And I said, 'What do you mean? And she said, he likes you so much more than you like you. It must be terrible.</p>
</details>

我当时想，这算什么？但她接着说：“和一个能看见你、真正了解你、并且如此爱你的人在一起，一定非常不舒服，因为你还没有找到一种方式去看见自己、爱自己。这肯定会令人不安。”这话太对了。我必须达到这样一个境界：或许我应该像他喜欢我一样喜欢我自己，然后再做一个更好的决定，判断这段关系是否能继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just kept thinking what what do you mean? He said it's got it's got to be very com uncomfortable to be with someone who sees you and really knows you and loves you so much when you have not found a way to see you and love you so much. It's got to be disconcerting. What an asshole man. like, wow. And it was true. I had to get to this point where I was like, I maybe I should like me as much as he likes me and then make a better decision about whether this is going to work or not.</p>
</details>

当你的成长环境中只有“愤怒”或“封闭”这两种情绪选择时，所有事情都必须归入这两个范畴。事实上，在我们过去15年的研究中，我们发现普通人能准确识别并命名的情绪只有三种：快乐、悲伤和愤怒。在我的家庭里，悲伤是不被允许的，那代表软弱。所以你只能愤怒或还好。因此，当我感到害怕、悲伤、焦虑、失望或痛苦时，我只会表现出愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you grow up and pissed off or shut down are your two emotional opportunities. Like there, you know, in Atlas of the Heart, I write about 87 emotions that I think are important to understand because the limits of our language are the limits of our world. When you have two buckets, then everything must go in those. And in fact, in our research over the last 15 years, we found the average person can accurately identify and name three emotions. Happy, sad, pissed off. And so in my family, sad was not an option. That was weakness. So you could be pissed or okay. So when I get scared, when I feel grief, when I'm anxious, when I feel disappointment, when I feel anguish, I'm just angry.</p>
</details>

为什么我不喜欢自己？因为我的父母用大量的羞耻感来教育我。很多都与外貌有关，要有趣。比如，你需要有烫过的金色大卷发，“头发越高，离上帝越近”。你需要坚强，戴上棒球帽就能迅速出门，不需过多打理，同时你又需要像选美皇后一样。外貌很重要，这里可是德州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, cuz my parents parented with a very big heaping dose of shame. And a ton of it was about appearance, being fun. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, big blonde hair with hot rollers. The higher the hair, the closer to God. You needed to be tough and strong and throw on a baseball cap and get somewhere really quick, low-maintenance, and you needed to be a beauty pageant queen. appearance mattered. This is Texas, baby.</p>

### 权力的运作：恐惧、残酷与政治叙事

纵观全球的政治管理，你会发现当权者现在使用权力的方式，很大程度上揭示了他们所恐惧的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you look at administrations political administrations across the world and you look at how power is being used right now it will tell you a lot about what they're afraid of.</p>
</details>

主持人回应说，当前似乎最能赢得选举的政治叙事是，将民众生活中的痛苦和苦难归咎于“那些特定肤色的人”。无论是跨越边境还是乘坐小艇穿越英吉利海峡的人，都被描绘成破坏你生活的罪魁祸首。这种叙事在美国和英国似乎都非常有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The leading political narrative at the moment that seems to be getting people elected is if you say those people with that skin color are the reason for the pain and anguish in your life. It's actually the people below you that are coming over the border or crossing the the English Channel on dingies that are ruining your life. And it seems to be like a really effective narrative to earn power both in the US and the UK.</p>
</details>

我认为我们从未讨论过比这更重要的话题。权力有多种形式，比如“与人共有的权力”（power with）和“内在的权力”（power within）。信奉这些权力形式的人认为，权力是无限的，分享能使其增长。而那些使用“驾驭他人的权力”（power over）的人则认为，权力是有限的，就像披萨，分给你一块，我就会少一块。所以权力必须被囤积和保护，不能分享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this to be honest with you. when when you use power especially power over because there's multiple kinds of power. There's power with into and power within. So people that use power within to and power within work from a belief system that's completely different. We believe that power is infinite and can grow when shared. People who use power over work from a belief system that power is finite like pizza and if I give you any I have a deficit. So it's got to be hoarded and protected and not shared.</p>
</details>

理解“驾驭他人的权力”至关重要，因为当人们使用这种权力时，他们无疑在告诉你他们害怕什么。如果你给人们一个可以厌恶和归咎其痛苦的对象，而且这个对象与投票者看起来不同，那么你十有八九会赢。你说：“我看到了你的痛苦，我能告诉你痛苦的根源，并且我能为你解决。”这个根源很容易辨认，你不会在他们身上看到自己的影子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Power over is really important to understand because when people are using power over, they're definitely letting you know what they're afraid of because that's what they're focused on and they're tapping into. And I think this is absolutely true. If you give people someone to dislike and blame for their pain and they look different than the people who are voting, you will win a 100 times out of 100. If you say, "I see your pain." I can tell you exactly the source of it and I can fix this for you. And the source of it is going to be easy to see. You're not going to see yourself in them.</p>
</details>

所以，你所谈论的叙事形成了一个完整的闭环。当权者利用权力来处理他们所恐惧的问题，他们通过利用恐惧并为人们树立一个敌人来获得权力。这就是权力运作的方式，无论是在组织、政治还是信仰社群中。为了维持这种“驾驭他人的权力”，你必须周期性地对弱势群体施加残酷行为，你必须提醒人们你的能力所及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that narrative that you are talking about it is a full circle. People in power use power to address issues that they're afraid of. They gain power by leveraging fear and giving people an enemy. That's how this works. It works like this. This is how power works in general. So power over is a very specific kind of power. And it's especially dangerous because in order to maintain it, you have to engage in periodic bouts of cruelty towards vulnerable populations. You have to remind people what you're capable of.</p>

### 系统思维：在复杂世界中保持边界的通透性

我是一个**系统理论**（Systems Theory: 一种跨学科的研究方法，旨在理解一个系统（无论是家庭、组织还是社会）中各个部分如何相互关联并作为一个整体运作）的信奉者。我认为，如果你不理解系统理论，尤其是在领导一个组织时，你将会落后。因为组织内外的复杂性要求我们需要一个框架来理解所有这些独立系统是如何相互碰撞的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a big systems theory. I'm a systems theory person. I think in systems theory I was trained in systems theory. I think if you don't understand system systems theory, at least if you're leading an organization right now, you're going to fall behind because the complexity inside and outside of organizations is such that we need a framework to understand how all of these individual systems are bumping up against each other.</p>
</details>

一个健康的系统必须保持边界的通透性，这意味着它必须允许反馈信息在系统内外流动，以保持觉知。当世界变得复杂时，我们开始不想要反馈，因为复杂性太大了。于是我们开始关闭那些通透的边界。当一个系统的边界不再通透时会发生什么？它会萎缩。在萎缩的过程中，系统会变得自我参照：“我们好吗？我们很好。我们对吗？我们很对。我们走在正轨上吗？我们就在正轨上。”因为它不再渴望外部反馈，即使是艰难的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a healthy system has permeable boundaries, meaning feedback is flowing in and out all the time. What happens when the world gets complex is we start not wanting the feedback. The complexity is too big. So we start shutting down those permeable boundaries. Well, what happens to a system where the boundaries are no longer permeable. It atrophies. And in the in the process of atrophying, the system becomes self-referencing. Are we good? We're great. Are we right? We're right. Are we on target? We're on target. because the boundaries of the system is are no longer craving outside feedback even when it's tough.</p>
</details>

在今天的商业环境中，地缘政治现实、市场变化、人工智能……一切都变得疯狂。我们那种关闭不确定性和复杂性的倾向，正是对我们工作和生活所在的系统最大的威胁。那种自我保护、关闭心墙、升起吊桥、在护城河里放满食人鱼的做法，我们已经没有这种奢侈了。我们必须保持边界的通透，必须不断学习、猜测、忘却旧知、再学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in businesses today, the geopolitical realities, the market changes, AI, I mean, it's crazy. And so our predisposition to shut down uncertainty and complexity is the biggest threat to the systems in which we work and live. the self-protect, close the wall, put up the drawbridge, fill the moat with piranhas. We just don't have that luxury. We've got to keep the the boundaries permeable. We've got to keep learning, guessing, unlearning, relearning.</p>
</details>

### 精神危机与认知主权

我们正处于一场精神危机中。我们情绪失调，互不信任，也不太相信自己，并且彼此脱节。但我不能放弃对人的信念，我的天性不是那样的。我就是相信，我们性本善多于性本贪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Spiritual crisis. We're emotionally disregulated. We're distrustful of each other. We don't trust ourselves very much. And we're disconnected. I can't give up on people, though. I'm not built that way. Like, I just believe that we are more good than greedy.</p>
</details>

有一次我和崔娃·诺亚（Trevor Noah）在一个活动上对话，我提出了一个我很兴奋的词：“**认知主权**（Cognitive Sovereignty: 指个人有能力控制自己的思想、注意力和信息消费，而不受算法或外部力量的操纵）”。我们需要从算法手中夺回控制权，决定我们消费什么、阅读什么、如何思考，进行批判性思考。我们需要将我们的注意力和专注力视为商品，因为有人正在追逐它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was in conversation with Trevor Noah at an event and I mentioned this term that I I was really excited about and he challenged me on it and I said, I think what we need is cognitive sovereignty. We need to wrestle control away from the algorithms and decide what we consume, what we read, how we think, think critically. We need to think about our attention and our focus as commodities that people are after because they're after them, right?</p>
</details>

但他提出了一个有趣的观点。他说：“不，布琳，我们需要的是更少的认知主权。”我问他什么意思。他说：“现在所有东西都是‘为你推荐’的页面。我们需要的是社群主权（communal sovereignty）。整个问题就在于你的‘为你推荐’页面是完全主权的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He had an interesting point though. He said, "No, we need less cognitive sovereignty, Brené." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "Everything's about the for you page. Everything's for you. We need communal sovereignty. He's like, you know, the whole problem is that your for you page is completely sovereign.</p>
</details>

最让我害怕的是，我因为工作的性质会进入一些奇怪的场合。我会在场，听到那些运营平台、拥有这些企业的人、CEO和创始人们的谈话，我听到的一些话是如此地不一致，让我感到恐慌。比如，我听到有人问一位科技亿万富翁：“我该让我的孩子学什么？”他会说：“他们应该学编程、物理。”五分钟后，另一个人问他：“你认为你的成功主要归功于什么？”同一个人会回答：“我对哲学和斯多葛学派的深度阅读。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let me tell you what scares me the most. I'm in some weird rooms because of the nature of my job. I'm in rooms where the people who run these platforms and own and you know that own the CEOs of these business and the founders are in these rooms and I hear them talking and I hear things that are so misaligned that it panics me. So I hear someone say, "Hey, you know, tech billionaire, what what should my kids study? I'm worried for my kids." well they should study coding physics you know and then five minutes later as if that answer didn't happen someone will say to what do you attribute your success I mean deeply when you think about it and the same person will say my deep reading of philosophy in the stoics.</p>
</details>

于是我就在想，到底是哪个？然后我开始推断，是否正在出现一个“思想阶层”，他们会说：“我们要读哲学、人文艺术和历史，而你们其他人，就继续刷手机吧。别担心那些大词，我们来为你们处理。”这就像有人问史蒂夫·乔布斯：“你的孩子们一定很爱iPad吧。”乔布斯说：“我的孩子们没有iPad。”他的传记作者也证实，他家晚餐时没有科技产品，他们在谈论艺术和历史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so then I'm thinking to myself well which is it dude and then I then I start to extrapolate from there and wonder if there is a thinking class that's emerging where they're like, "We're going to read philosophy and we're going to read the liberal arts and we're going to study history and the rest of you just keep scrolling. Don't worry about the big words. We'll we'll handle all the big words for you." Like, it's like when they asked Steve Jobs, "Boy, your kids must love the iPad." Steve Jobs said, "My kids don't have an iPad." And then his biographer who spent time with his family said he wasn't kidding. There's no technology at dinner. They're talking about art and history.</p>
</details>

### 脆弱的真相：勇气与情感的试金石

脆弱性是我们面临不确定性、风险和情感暴露时所体验到的情绪。我曾去布拉格堡与特种部队合作，我问士兵们一个问题：“给我举一个你生命中关于勇气的例子，这个例子不需要不确定性、风险或情感暴露。”没有人能回答。最后，一个年轻士兵站起来说：“三次战地部署。没有脆弱就没有勇气。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vulnerability is the emotion we experience when we have when we are up against uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. So it took a trip to Fort Bragg working with special forces to ask soldiers a question. Give me a single example of courage in your life. One example that you've witnessed or you you yourself have done. One example of courage that did not require uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure. No one could answer it. Finally a young soldier stood up and said three tours. There is no courage without vulnerability.</p>
</details>

所以，脆弱重要吗？如果我们想勇敢地生活，它就重要。勇气是在你无法预测结果时，依然愿意全身心投入。勇气是先说“我爱你”。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？就是先说“我爱你”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. Courage is a willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome. Courage is saying, "I love you first." That's you. You want to know what vulnerability is? I love you first.</p>
</details>

最脆弱的人类情感是喜悦。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于当我们中的一些人接近它时，我们会预演悲剧，为失望做准备。我们甚至不敢让自己感受喜悦，因为我们太害怕有人会把它夺走，我们会被失望重击。人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿去感受失望的风险，去为某件事感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most the most vulnerable human emotion, joy. Joy is so vulnerable that when some of us get close to it, we dress rehearse tragedy to prepare for disappointment. Like it's so vulnerable that we don't even let ourselves feel joy because we're so afraid someone's going to rip it away and we're going to get sucker punched by disappointment. people choose to live disappointed rather than to feel disappoint. risk feeling disappointed and get excited about something.</p>
</details>

我们研究发现，唯一能持续拥抱喜悦的人群，是那些将脆弱感带来的身体颤抖作为提醒，去感恩，在那一刻练习感恩的人。所以，感恩是喜悦的巨大催化剂。这不是天生的，而是一种训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The only group of people that could take that, you know, there's a bodily quiver, right, of vulnerability. The only people that can really lean into joy consistently are people who use that vulnerability quiver as a reminder to be grateful to be able to practice gratitude in that second. So gratitude is a huge enabler of joy. Is that automatic or can one train that? No, it's a training.</p>
</details>

### 信任的建立：大理石罐理论

人们总是问我，是先有信任还是先有脆弱。我认为这是一个非常缓慢的叠加过程。我们互相了解，我分享一点，你回应一点。我不会一见面就说：“你好，史蒂芬，这是我最黑暗、最痛苦的创伤。”因为那种“试金石测试”其实是一种盔甲。我扔给你一些我们关系还无法承受的东西，你会走开，然后我用这个来验证脆弱是危险的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People always ask me what comes first, trust or vulnerability. Do I trust you first, then I'm vulnerable, or am I vulnerable first and then I trust you? And I think it's a very slow stacking. We get to know each other. I share a little bit. I don't I don't share, hey, nice to meet you, Stephen. Here's my darkest, horrible, most painful trauma. You know, cuz that that is actually that kind of litmus testing is actually a form of armor. I'm going to throw something at you that our relationship in no way has been built long enough to hold. You're going to go away and I'm going to use that as verification that vulnerability is dangerous.</p>
</details>

不，信任和脆弱是这样建立的：脆弱一点，信任一点，再脆弱一点，再信任一点。我女儿艾伦上四年级时，有一天放学回家，因为在学校被朋友背叛而痛哭，她说：“我再也不会相信任何人了。”当时我立刻想到一个比喻。我说：“信任就像一个大理石罐。”

<p class="english-text">Vulnerability, trust, vulnerability, trust, vulnerability, trust. My daughter Ellen's in fourth grade, she comes home from school. She slides down the door into a heap, sobbing. She said that something hard happened. She shared it like very confidentially with one or two of her friends during recess. When she got back to the classroom, they had told everybody in her class. And she said, "I will never trust anyone again." I said, "Trust is the marble jar."</p>

我解释说：“每当你和别人分享机密，而他们保守了秘密，他们就得到一颗大理石。当你想要分享非常私人的事情时，你会找那些罐子里装满大理石的朋友。”她立刻明白了，并举例说她的朋友汉娜和洛娜是如何赢得大理石的：午餐时为她留座，生病时关心她，记住她祖父母的名字。这些都是非常微小的举动。

<p class="english-text">"Every time you share somebody something with someone that's confidential and they don't share it, they get a marble. Every time you build trust, when you want to share something really private and personal, you look for a friend whose jar is full of marbles. Do you have any marble jar friends?" And she said, "Tell me something they do to earn marbles." Oh, well like if I get to my tray late at lunch and there's no place to sit, Lorna will scoot over and give me half her seat. And then the other day when I had strep throat, Hannah was worried about me. She remembered their names. And what was shocking to me is that Ellen was conveying that these marbles were being earned on these very small.</p>

这让我立刻想到了戈特曼夫妇的研究，他们说信任是在日常的点滴小事中赢得的。戈特曼博士讲过一个“推拉门时刻”的故事：他在看书的关键时刻，看到妻子在哭泣。他可以选择假装没看见回去看书，也可以选择停下来关心她，建立信任。他选择了后者。我们每天都面临无数这样的“推拉门时刻”。信任就是这样，一次一颗大理石，慢慢积累起来的。这就是我们教给财富100强公司最高层领导的信任之道。

<p class="english-text">So I immediately go to the Gottman's. I go to the Gottman's research on trust. And I read right off the bat where Gottman say trust is earned in small moments every day. He tells a story about how he's on the second to last page of his mystery. He sees his wife crying and brushing her hair. He's like, "That's a sliding door moment. I can I have a choice in that moment. to build trust and stop and say what's going on or to build betrayal and pretend like I don't see her hurting." That's a sliding door moment that we have all the time, right? And so to me, trust is built slowly over time, a marble at a time. And that's how that's how we teach trust to the most senior leaders in Fortune 100 companies. That trust is a marble jar.</p>

### 卸下盔甲：中年人的核心课题

我研究生涯中最大的发现之一或许是：阻碍我们勇敢面对生活和工作的不是恐惧，而是盔甲。人人都会害怕，害怕没关系。危险的是我们在害怕时为自我保护而穿上的盔甲，以及那副盔甲如何让我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。

<details>

<p class="english-text">maybe one of the biggest findings of my research over the last 25 years is it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's armor. Everybody's afraid. It's okay to be afraid. What's dangerous is the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values.</p>
</details>

对我来说，最艰难的工作就是不断地意识到：我的盔甲是什么？当害怕时，我抓住了什么来保护我的自我价值和自尊？那东西又有多沉重？在成长过程中，我必须穿上它，那是为了生存。但这是中年时期一个重大的发展里程碑，宇宙会抓住你的肩膀，把你拉近，说：“我不再开玩笑了。你被赋予了天赋，选择不成长不是无害的，那是有后果的。你的盔甲正在碍事。你现在是成年人了，有不同的选择。放开那些不再为你服务的东西。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I think the hardest work is for me constantly being aware of what is my armor? What am I what am I grabbing for when I'm afraid? What am I grabbing for when I want to protect my sense of self-worth, my ego? Like, and and how heavy that shit is. You know, at some point I had to wear it because that was survival for me growing up. But this is the big this is the big developmental milestone of middle age which is kind of when the universe grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you really close and says I'm not fucking around anymore. They gave you gifts. Choosing not to grow into them is not benign. There's a consequence for that and your armor is getting in the way. You're a grown ass person now. You have different choices. Let go of what doesn't serve.</p>

这就是我们在中年时期必须面对的重大课题：什么东西不再有益，并阻碍我们成长为想成为的人？而所有的盔甲，都与脆弱有关。

<p class="english-text">And that is the big milestone I think that we have to wrestle with in midlife. What no longer serves that's preventing us from growing into who we want to be. And is that where vulnerability comes into the picture? Oh, for sure. Cuz all the armor, all the armor is about vulnerability.</p>

### 成为更好的自己

你问我是否克服了旧的自己。不，我正在克服中。我还没有完全克服。我唯一克服的，是“我将克服一切”的信念。我克服了那种认为自己总有一天会“到达终点”的想法。

<p class="english-text">It appears you've overcome various traits of old Brené Brown. No, I'm overcoming. Overcoming? No, I'm not over I have not overcome. Have you overcome anything? Yes. The belief that I will overcome anything. I have overcome the belief that I have overcome the belief that I will ever arrive.</p>
</details>

但我很感激我拥有的新技能，它们让我更贴近我想成为的那个人、那个母亲、那个伴侣、那个领导者。但我会时刻提醒自己，当我害怕时，我会变得可怕；我很容易把事情灾难化，这对周围的每个人都很痛苦；我不需要被喜欢，我只需要做我自己。因为就在两天前，我还会坐下来说：“天啊，在这里被喜欢也太容易了。”然后我又想：“该死，我不再做那种事了。”真扫兴。

<p class="english-text">I am grateful for the skills that I have that are new skills that keep me more aligned with the person, the mom, the partner, the leader that I want to be. But I I am mindful all the I try to stay very mindful that I am scary when I'm scared that I catastrophize very very easily and that's painful for everybody around me and I don't need to be liked. I just need to be myself. Like, but those are things because I will I will sit down like two days ago and be like, "Oh my god, it'd be so freaking easy to be liked here." I was like, "This will be this would be a piece of cake." And I'm like, "Shit, I don't do that anymore." Bummer.</p>

为什么选择做自己？因为现在，我最后一个要背叛的人，是我自己。

<p class="english-text">Why? Because now the person I'm going to betray last is me.</p>

有人可能会觉得，知道自己可能永远无法治愈那些他们迫切想要改变的部分，会感到有些沮丧。我认为人们来听播客、读我的书，是想寻找解决办法，修复他们不喜欢自己的地方，修复他们对情绪的反应方式。他们想修复它，因为如果能修复，他们就能快乐。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Some people might find that somewhat demoralizing to know that they they too might never cure parts of themselves that they're desperate to change. I think people, you know, they often come to podcasts like this or read books like yours looking for sol fix fixes to not liking myself to the way that I react to my emotions. They want to fix it cuz if they can fix it, then they can be happy.</p>
</details>

我认为这不在考虑范围之内，原因很美妙：如果我们能修复它，并且再也不用与之斗争，我们就会对他人极度缺乏宽容，我们会变成暴君。正是因为我们自己也在挣扎，才让我们对他人产生同理心。

<p class="english-text">I don't think that's in the consideration set for a very beautiful reason that if we could fix it and never have to wrestle with it again, we would be so short on grace for other people that we would be tyrants. So, you think it it creates a form of empathy for others?</p>

我现在喜欢自己了吗？是的，我喜欢。我喜欢我正在成为的样子。
