title: 布琳·布朗：我们正深陷一场无人承认的精神危机
summary: 著名研究学者布琳·布朗深入探讨了当前社会普遍存在的精神危机。她剖析了童年经历如何塑造我们对爱与脆弱的认知，并指出阻碍我们勇敢生活的并非恐惧本身，而是我们为自我保护而穿上的“盔甲”。布朗通过“权力类型”、“系统论”和“大理石罐理论”等概念，阐释了脆弱、勇气、联结与信任的内在关系，为个人成长和领导力提供了深刻的洞见和可行的实践路径。

### 阻碍我们勇敢的不是恐惧，而是盔甲

**主持人:** 你是单一嘉宾中被要求次数最多的。

**布琳·布朗:** 让我告诉你，这并不容易，因为我们触及了一些艰难的领域。但我认为我们再也不会谈论比这更重要的事情了。因为阻碍我们勇敢地面对生活和工作的不是恐惧，而是我们在害怕时为自我保护而伸向的盔甲。以及那副盔甲如何使我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。最艰难的工作是意识到，当我害怕时，我的盔甲是什么。

<p class="english-text">You are the single most requested guest.</p>
<p class="english-text">And let me tell you, this has not been easy because we went to some hard places. But I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this. Cuz it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And the hardest work is being aware of what is my armor when I'm afraid.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 这是自动的吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 哦，不。这是一种训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that automatic?</p>
<p class="english-text">Oh, no. It's a training.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 那么，我们就从这里开始吧。布琳·布朗是一位偶像人物，她在羞耻、脆弱和联结方面的世界领先研究，激励了像皮克斯、谷歌和美国特种部队这样的公司，去培养更强大的领导者，并帮助普通人释放他们的全部潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's start with that. Then, Brené Brown is an icon whose world-leading research in shame, vulnerability, and connection has inspired companies like Pixar, Google, and the US special forces to build stronger leaders and help the everyday person unlock their full potential.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 准备好了吗？脆弱性重要吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 如果我们想勇敢地生活，它就很重要。但我们从小被教育相信脆弱就是软弱。比如在我的家庭里，我们被允许愤怒，但悲伤不是一个选项。你必须坚强。所以当我害怕、焦虑、失望时，我只会表现出愤怒。因此，如果你在成长过程中没有接触过脆弱，它会让你陷入危险。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？喜悦。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿为某件事感到兴奋，去冒险被失望打个措手不及。没有脆弱就没有勇气，因为勇气是愿意在无法预测结果的情况下，全身心投入地出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ready? Is vulnerability important?</p>
<p class="english-text">It is if we want to be brave with our lives. But we were raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness. Like in my family, we were allowed anger, but sad was not an option. You needed to be tough. And so when I get scared, when I feel anxious, disappointed, I'm just angry. And so when you're raised without vulnerability, it'll put you in jeopardy. Like, you want to know what vulnerability is? Joy. Joy is so vulnerable that people choose to live disappointed rather than to get excited about something and risk getting sucker punched by disappointment. Like, there is no courage without vulnerability because courage is the willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 哇。我以前从未想过这个问题。但你可以培养技能。

**布琳·布朗:** 我们已经带领 16.5 万人完成了这项工作。其中包括如何建立信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. I've never thought about that before. But you can develop skills.</p>
<p class="english-text">We've taken 165,000 people through this work. That included how to build trust.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我听说过你的“大理石罐理论”。你能给我解释一下你的大理石罐……看你多兴奋？

**布琳·布朗:** 我知道。这就是我们教给财富 100 强公司最高层领导者关于信任的方法。这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I've heard about your marble jar theory. Could you explain to me what your marble jar look how excited you are?</p>
<p class="english-text">I know. So this is how we teach trust to the most senior leaders in Fortune 100 companies. It's awesome.</p>
</details>

### 童年经历：在混乱中学会察言观色

**主持人:** 为了理解你所做的所有工作，你对世界的看法，以及你在许多方面作为一个“异类”的身份，我想了解你最早的成长环境、你来自哪里、是什么塑造了你，这可能很重要。

**布琳·布朗:** 我卡在了“我是个异类吗？”这个问题上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In order to um understand all the work that you have done and the perspective that you have on the world and also who you are as a anomaly in many respects, I think it's probably important that I understand your earliest context, where you've come from, what shaped you.</p>
<p class="english-text">I'm stuck on an am I a am I an anomaly?</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你当然是个异类。这应该不让你惊讶。我的意思是，如果看看你的成就，你的成就就是异乎寻常的。所以人们会假设，是某种东西让你成为了一个异类。

**布琳·布朗:** 我会说我是一个第五代德州人。我来自一个相当功能失调的家庭。父母用他们所知的一切尽力而为。他们俩都来自非常非常艰难的成长环境，包括贫困和成瘾。所以，你可能会想到的关于第五代德州人的许多刻板印象——坚强、不哭——我们被允许的情感范围非常小，要么是“被认可”，也就是生气，要么是“还行”。比如愤怒是可以的，但你不能真的悲伤，脆弱也不是个事儿。脆弱是软弱和可怕的，会让你陷入危险。我在家和在学校都感觉像个局外人，但我非常擅长解读人、解读情境。我想，一路走来，有个治疗师曾说：“是的，那是**过度警觉**（Hypervigilance: 一种高度警惕周围环境以寻找潜在威胁的状态）。你处于过度警觉状态。我能看到周围的一切，我知道发生的一切。我能很快地将别人看不到的事情联系起来。”家里有欢笑，也有爱。但有大量的不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I of course you're an anomaly. Of course you're an anomaly. That that should be of no surprise to you. I mean, if you look at your outcomes, your outcomes are anomalous. So, one would assume that there's some form of something that made you an anomaly.</p>
<p class="english-text">I would say that I'm a fifth generation Texan. I came from a fair amount of dysfunction. Parents doing the best they could with what they knew. both coming from really really really tough upbringings that included you know poverty addiction and so probably a lot of the stereotypes you would think about fifth generation Texan tough don't cry we were allowed a very small continuum of emotions were approval you know or approved which were pissed off or okay like anger was okay but no you couldn't be sad really or vulnerability was not a thing. Vulnerability was weakness and scary and puts you in jeopardy. I felt like a real outsider at home and in school, but I was really good at reading people, reading situations. I think my I think a therapist somewhere along the way said, "Yes, that's hypervigilance. You're hypervigilant. You know, I can see everything around me. I know everything's going on. I can connect things very quickly that other people don't see." And there was laughter and there was love. But there was a ton of unpredictability.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我正想说，通常不就是某种需求，让你在年轻时必须如此警觉，从而产生了过度警觉吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。是的。我的意思是，是的，在我的家庭里，爱玩和坚强是非常受重视的。这些是价值观。这些都在父母的记分卡上。如果你有趣、随和，能射得准、吐得远、钓得好，开得快，你就能得 A。所以那些事情非常受重视。运动能力也非常受重视。但是那些有趣的事情可能很快就会变得非常艰难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was going to say, isn't that typically what creates hypervigilance is some kind of need to be that aware when you're young?</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think yes, being fun-loving was very valued in my family and being tough. These were the values. These are these are on the parental scorecard. This is what got you an A. if you're fun, easy, you can, you know, shoot straight, spit far, fish well, like really drive fast. And so those things were very valued. Athleticism was very valued. Um, but those fun things could turn really hard very quickly.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 这里有一个很大的停顿。4 秒的停顿。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的，我能想象到那个画面，就像，在……之前都很有趣。在你的一个家长因为太过分而被驱逐出赛场之前，都很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a big pause there. 4 second pause as you</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I could just picture it like it's fun until It's fun until you've had a parent eject ejected from a game for being so hard.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 那是你的父亲。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was your father.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 哦，如果他被驱逐出赛场，那他当时一定非常过分。

**布琳·布朗:** 哦是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, he was really hard then if he was ejected from a game.</p>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我看到一张你和你兄弟姐妹的照片，你紧紧地抱着他们，我想你提到过，从那张照片里能看到你眼中的某种恐惧。你知道我指的是哪张照片吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 我是在沙发上吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a photo I saw of you and your siblings where you're clutching your siblings and I think you referred to it as you could see there was a certain fear in your eyes. Do you know the photo I'm referring to?</p>
<p class="english-text">Am I on a couch?</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你在一个沙发上。

**布琳·布朗:** 像是 70 年代那种黄色的天鹅绒沙发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're on a couch.</p>
<p class="english-text">Like a yellow velour couch like from the 70s.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 是的。

**布琳·布朗:** 我会想起那张照片。我喜欢那张照片。但作为长女，我确实扮演着保护者的角色。我的代号是“大姐大”。这虽是开玩笑，但也不是开玩笑。比如，如果我父母之间的事情变得很糟，他们会激烈地争吵，我就会去把我所有的兄弟姐妹都带到我的房间里。然后我下楼去处理。我绝对是保护者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p class="english-text">I think about that picture. I like that picture. But there was definitely I definitely had a protector role as the oldest. I mean code named sister superior. It was jokingly but it wasn't joking. Like if things got hard between my parents and they would get in volatile fights, I would go get all my siblings, put them in my room. I'd go downstairs and handle it, you know? Like I was definitely the protector.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 身体上的激烈争吵？

**布琳·布朗:** 偶尔有，但更多是情绪上的激烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">physically volatile fights</p>
<p class="english-text">um on occasion but more emotionally volatile.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 尖叫和叫喊。是的。

**布琳·布朗:** 和我父母一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Screaming and shouting. Yeah.</p>
<p class="english-text">Same with my parents.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 是的，就是很吵。

**布琳·布朗:** 我整个童年，我整个房子的背景音就是尖叫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Just loud.</p>
<p class="english-text">There's a background in my whole house for my whole childhood was just screaming.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我们家有很多尖叫声，如果你是在尖叫声中长大的，听到隔着墙的尖叫声，你懂那种声音。

**布琳·布朗:** 你听过那种声音吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a Yeah, we had a lot of screaming and there's a certain like if you grew up with screaming, hearing screaming through a wall, you know that sound.</p>
<p class="english-text">Do you hear that sound?</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 当然。哦天哪。那是我整个童年。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。所以，是的，我很抱歉，因为我不喜欢听到关于你童年的这些，我也不喜欢知道关于我童年的这些，但确实有很多尖叫声。所以，我想，过度警觉、保护、负责任，再加上一种“你最好给我小心点，因为我会保护我的兄弟姐妹”的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course. Yeah. Oh my god. It was my whole childhood. Yeah.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so, yeah, I'm sorry because I don't like to hear that about your childhood and I don't like to know that about my childhood, but there was a lot of screaming. And so, I think hypervigilant, protective, responsible with a dose of be very [ __ ] careful because I will protect my siblings.</p>
</details>

### 爱的模型与亲密关系中的“高墙”

**主持人:** 那在你年轻时是如何改变你对爱的模型的？肯定有影响，因为我对我自己的情况也有同样的感觉。我想我学到的教训是，爱就像一座监狱，因为是我妈妈在喊，而我爸爸是囚犯，他不会回应。所以你看到一个女人对他喊六七个小时，而他坐在那里，像个无生命的物体一样看着屏幕。我记得当时在想，“哦，好吧。所以如果我长大后谈恋爱，我就会成为一个女人的囚犯。好吧，听起来不吸引人。”如果你换个房间，她会跟着他。所以我像躲瘟疫一样躲避恋爱关系。直到 27 岁左右我都做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and how did that change your model of love as a young person? It must have been because I mean I obviously feel the same way about about my situation. And um I think the lesson I learned was that love was like a prison cuz it was my mom doing the shouting and my dad was the prisoner and he wouldn't respond. So this you've got a woman shouting at him for six seven hours a day and him sat there like he's a like an inanimate object looking at the screen. And I remember thinking, "Oh, okay. So, if I get in a relationship when I'm older, then I'm going to be a prisoner to a woman. Okay? Doesn't sound doesn't sound appealing. And if you move to a different room, you'd follow him. So, I avoided relationships like the [ __ ] plague. I did well until about 27.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 然后呢？

**主持人:** 然后有人翻过了那堵墙，修正了一些证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then what?</p>
<p class="english-text">And then someone got over the wall and corrected some of the evidence.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 他们翻过了墙。

**主持人:** 她不知怎么地翻过了墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They got over the wall.</p>
<p class="english-text">She got over the wall somehow.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。史蒂夫翻过了墙。该死。那是你的伴侣，不是我。只是为了说明背景。

**主持人:** 不，不是你。虽然你现在干得非常出色。你就像是越过了一条我喜欢的、满是食人鱼的护城河。但是吊桥……我看到……我看到我的史蒂夫……我的史蒂夫绝对是翻过了墙。但那就像是“英雄识英雄”。他也有堵墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Steve got over the wall. Damn it. That's your partner, not me. Just for context.</p>
<p class="english-text">No, not Yeah. Not you. Although you're doing a hell of a job right now. Um, you're like you've crossed a piranha filled moat that I like. Um, but the drawbridge is like I'm see I'm just see I'm going to see my Steve my Steve definitely definitely got over the wall. Um, but it was like game game recognizes game. He had a wall.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 哦，好的。

**主持人:** 是的。所以我们对我们的墙进行了长时间的交谈。通过那些交谈，我们之间的墙慢慢地……就……崩塌了。我们现在已经在一起 38 年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, okay.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh, and so we had long conversations about our walls and and slowly through those conversations. We just those walls crumbled with each other and we've been together now for 38 years.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 哇。

**主持人:** 是的。这是我一生中做过的最难的事情，毫无疑问，伙计。没有比这更难的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life bar none, dude. Nothing has been harder.</p>
</details>

### 自我价值的挑战：当他人比你更爱你

**布琳·布朗:** 当我开始和史蒂夫约会时……嗯，我们结婚六个月后，你知道，你说对你而言，爱将意味着成为一个囚犯。并且不得不为了生存而封闭自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I started dating, Steve, well, when we got married, six months after we got married, this is, you know, you you said for you love was going to be being a prisoner. Mhm. And having to just shut down to survive.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 逃跑。

**布琳·布朗:** 逃跑。对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Run away.</p>
<p class="english-text">Run away. Right.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 不要面对它。现在不要谈话。

**布琳·布朗:** 不。对我来说，结婚六个月后，我去看了一个治疗师，我说：“我做不到。我必须离开这段婚姻。”我们在结婚前断断续续约会了七年。我说：“我得离开。”她说：“这很难。我能看出这行不通。”我当时对史蒂夫产生了一丝防御心理。我说：“你什么意思？”她说：“他喜欢你的程度远超过你喜欢你自己的程度。这一定很糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Don't confront it. No conversations now.</p>
<p class="english-text">No. Um, for me, 6 months after we were married, I went to go see a therapist and I said, "I cannot do this. I've got to get out of this marriage." And we had dated off and on for 7 years before we got married. And I said, "I got to get out." And she said, "I could th this is hard. I I could see how this is not working." And I was like, I had a twinge of defensiveness about Steve. And I said, 'What do you mean? And she said, he likes you so much more than you like you. It must be terrible.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我当时想，“去你的，伙计。你被解雇了。”我当时想，我太……我心想，什么？那是我会做的事。所以如果你……我要告诉你我的一个“破绽”。如果我发出一个非常高音的“什么？”，那意味着我正在找我的钱包，我知道门在哪里。我只是不停地想，你什么意思？她说：“和一个能看到你、真正了解你、并且如此爱你的人在一起，肯定非常不舒服，尤其是当你还没有找到一种方式去看到自己、如此爱自己的时候。这肯定会让人不安。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like, [ __ ] you, man. You're fired. I was like, I am so I thought, what? That's what I do. So if you I'm going to give you one of my tells. If I do a really highpitched what that means I'm that means I'm looking for my purse and I'm get I know where the door is. Um I I I just kept thinking what what do you mean? He said it's got it's got to be very com uncomfortable to be with someone who sees you and really knows you and loves you so much when you have not found a way to see you and love you so much. It's got to be disconcerting.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 真是个混蛋，哇。但那是真的。我必须达到这样一个点，我开始想，也许我应该像他喜欢我一样喜欢我自己，然后再做一个更好的决定，关于这段关系是否能行得通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What an [ __ ] man. like, wow. And it was true. I had to get to this point where I was like, I maybe I should like me as much as he likes me and then make a better decision about whether this is going to work or not.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 当你在一个只有“生气”或“封闭”两种情绪选择的环境中长大时，就像，你知道，在《心灵地图集》（Atlas of the Heart）中，我写了 87 种我认为很重要的情绪需要理解，因为我们语言的局限就是我们世界的局限。当你的情绪只有两个桶时，所有东西都必须放进这两个桶里。事实上，在我们过去 15 年的研究中，我们发现普通人能准确识别并说出三种情绪：快乐、悲伤、生气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you grow up and pissed off or shut down are your two emotional opportunities. Like there, you know, in Atlas of the Heart, I write about 87 emotions that I think are important to understand because the limits of our language are the limits of our world. When you have two buckets, then everything must go in those. And in fact, in our research over the last 15 years, we found the average person can accurately identify and name three emotions. Happy, sad, pissed off.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 在我的家庭里，悲伤不是一个选项。那是软弱。所以你要么生气，要么还行。所以当我害怕、感到悲痛、焦虑、失望、痛苦时，我只会表现出愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in my family, sad was not an option. That was weakness. So you could be pissed or okay. So when I get scared, when I feel grief, when I'm anxious, when I feel disappointment, when I feel anguish, I'm just angry.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我脑子里有两个悬而未决的问号，答案可能是一样的。但你早些时候说你在学校或家里都格格不入，我不明白为什么。然后另一个问题是，治疗师对你说，或者断言，你不如他喜欢你那样喜欢自己。我也不清楚是什么让你不喜欢自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's two sort of outstanding question marks in my head and they might be the same answer, but it's you said earlier on that you didn't fit in at school or at home, and I didn't understand why you didn't fit in at school or at home. And then the other thing that's still a question mark in my head is the therapist said to you that you well asserted that you didn't like yourself as much as he liked you. And I wasn't clear on what made you not like yourself.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我想离开我长大的地方。我想离开我所知的一切。所以我总感觉自己是个局外人。我不想做……我当时不受欢迎，也没和橄榄球队的四分卫约会。那是我父母、他们父母、以及他们父母的父母的梦想，你知道，你成为啦啦队长，和四分卫约会，然后得到一个农场。所以我觉得自己不可爱，不受欢迎，不被理解。而在家里，我不是个随和的人。我很焦虑，总是戒备着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wanted out of where I was raised. I wanted to leave everything I knew. And so I always felt like an outsider. I didn't didn't want to do I mean I wasn't popular. I wasn't dating a quarterback. That was a dream that my my parents and their parents and their parents, you know, you were you were a bearcadet and you dated a quarterback and you got a farm. So at I felt not cute, not popular, not understood. And then at home, I wasn't easygoing. I was an I was anxious. and and always ready.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 关于自尊的问题，治疗师强调的你不像史蒂夫喜欢你那样喜欢自己，那又是从何而来？或者说这与之前说的有关系吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 哦，因为我父母用大量的羞耻感来教育我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the point about self-esteem, which the therapist sort of highlighted about not liking oneself as much as Steve liked you, where did that come from or is that related in some way?</p>
<p class="english-text">Oh, cuz my parents parented with a very big heaping dose of shame.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 哦，好的。所以如果你完成了某件事，或者没完成某件事，你都会因此感到难过。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。而且很多都关乎外表，关乎是否有趣。是的，外表。是的。比如，你知道，用热卷发器做的大波浪金发。头发越高，离上帝越近。你需要坚强有力，能戴上棒球帽迅速赶到某个地方，低维护成本，同时你还需要像选美皇后一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, okay. So, if you accomplish something or you don't accomplish something, you're made to feel bad about it.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And a ton of it was about appearance, being fun. Appearance. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, big blonde hair with hot rollers. The higher the hair, the closer to God. You needed to be tough and strong and throw on a baseball cap and get somewhere really quick, lowmaintenance, and you needed to be a beauty pageant queen.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你还记得他们曾以一种让你至今难忘的方式批评你的外表吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 我想是的。我的意思是，我认为不只是他们。我的意思是，让年轻女孩和年轻女性不产生对自尊的威胁，这不仅仅是父母的事情。这就像要求她们不要呼吸，因为空气有毒。就像来自各处的所有信息，你知道，时尚杂志，你读了会想，“哇，我看起来不像这样。我怎么才能变成这样？”你知道，然后你会在身上涂满婴儿油，在头发上抹柠檬汁。你在下巴下面放锡纸，尽可能多地晒太阳，因为我们当时不知道那会致癌。我们都穿着需要用钳子才能拉上拉链的牛仔裤，因为它们太紧了。外表很重要。这里是德州，宝贝。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Do you remember them ever being critical of your appearance in a way that has stayed with you?</p>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I guess. I mean, I think not just them. I mean, like I think having young girls and young women, keeping them from developing threats to their self-esteem is not just a parental thing. It's like it's like asking them not to breathe because the air is poison. Like it's like every message from everywhere, you know, the fashion magazines, you'd read them and you think, "Wow, I don't I don't look like this. How am I going to look like this?" You know, and you'd lather yourself up with baby oil and you put lemon juice in your hair. You put tin foil under your chin, get as much sun cancer as you could cuz we didn't know, you know, like you you'd we all wore jeans that you had to put on with pliers with for the zipper cuz they were so tight. appearance mattered. This is Texas, baby.</p>

### 权力的四种类型与“权力凌驾”的危险

**主持人:** 在过去的二十年里，你认为世界发生了怎样的变化？

**布琳·布朗:** 荣格派学者会说，在任何伟大的进步之前，都会有一次倒退。我认为，当你观察世界各地的政治政府，看看现在权力是如何被使用的，它会告诉你很多关于他们害怕什么的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how has your perspective on how has the world changed in those last two decades in your view?</p>
<p class="english-text">Unions would say before any great progression there is a regression and I think that when you look at various admin I know you have a very global audience when you look at administrations political administrations across the world and you look at how power is being used right now it will tell you a lot about what they're afraid of.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我最近和我的好朋友们有过一次对话。我们谈到目前主流的政治叙事，在美国和英国，似乎能让人们当选的叙事是，如果你说“那些肤色的人是你生活中痛苦和苦难的根源”。实际上是那些地位比你低的人，那些越过边境或乘着小艇穿越英吉利海峡的人，正在毁掉你的生活。这似乎是赢得权力的一种非常有效的叙事方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was thinking about a conversation I had recently with my my best friends. It must have been this weekend. Yeah, it was this weekend cuz it was my friend's birthday in Manchester, the UK. So, we flew in. Um and we had a conversation about how the leading political narrative at the moment, this might be adjacent to what you were saying, but it's the way I interpreted it. The leading political narrative at the moment that seems to be getting people elected is if you say those people with that skin color are the reason for the pain and anguish in your life. It's actually the people below you that are coming over the border or crossing the the English Channel on dingies that are ruining your life. And it seems to be like a realy effective narrative to earn power both in the US and the UK. like the central narrative that is swaying elections it seems at the moment in the UK and the US is those brown people on that boat or coming over the border are the reason for the pain in your life and it seems to work and that seems to be the thing getting power so that's kind of what ran through my head when I had this idea of like power and what you're scared of actually think I inverted it to if I can tell you what to be scared of or find the thing you might be scared of or whatever then I get power but maybe it goes the other way too</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 老实说，我认为我们再也不会谈论比这更重要的事情了。当你使用权力，特别是“权力凌驾”（power over），因为权力有多种类型。还有“权力共生”（power with）、“权力赋予”（power to）和“内在权力”（power within）。使用“权力共生”和“内在权力”的人，他们的信念系统完全不同。我们相信权力是无限的，可以通过分享而增长。而使用“权力凌驾”的人，他们的信念系统认为权力是有限的，就像披萨一样，如果我分给你一点，我就会有损失。所以权力必须被囤积、保护，而不能分享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this to be honest with you that's Why I thought your response was so interesting cuz you you you made if I was going to like do the text box above your face it would have said well holy [ __ ] that's interesting because when when you use power especially power over because there's multiple kinds of power. There's power with into and power within. So people that use power within to and power within work from a belief system that's completely different. We believe that power is infinite and can grow when shared. People who use power over work from a belief system that power is finite like pizza and if I give you any I have a deficit. So it's got to be hoarded and protected and not shared.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 理解“权力凌驾”非常重要，因为当人们使用它时，他们肯定是在让你知道他们害怕什么，因为那正是他们关注和利用的。我认为这绝对是真的。如果你给人们一个可以厌恶和归咎于他们痛苦的对象，而且这些人看起来与投票的人不同，你将百战百胜。如果你说：“我看到了你的痛苦。我可以告诉你痛苦的确切来源，并且我可以为你解决这个问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Power over is really important to understand because when people are using power over, they're definitely letting you know what they're afraid of because that's what they're focused on and they're tapping into. And I think this is absolutely true. If you give people someone to dislike and blame for their pain and they look different than the people who are voting, you will win a 100 times out of 100. If you say, "I see your pain." I can tell you exactly the source of it and I can fix this for you.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 并且痛苦的来源很容易看到。你不会在他们身上看到自己。

**布琳·布朗:** 所以你谈论的那种叙事是一个完整的循环。当权者利用权力来解决他们害怕的问题。他们通过利用恐惧并给人们一个敌人来获得权力。这就是它的运作方式。我在组织中花了 95% 的时间与高管和高级领导者一起工作。这就是它在组织中的运作方式，在政治领域、在信仰社区中的运作方式。这就是权力通常的运作方式。“权力凌驾”是一种非常特殊的权力。它尤其危险，因为为了维持它，你必须定期对弱势群体进行残酷行为。你必须提醒人们你的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the source of it is going to be easy to see. You're not going to see yourself in them. M</p>
<p class="english-text">so that narrative that you are talking about it is a full circle. People in power use power to address issues that they're afraid of. They gain power by leveraging fear and giving people an enemy. That's how this works. It works like this. I mean I spend 95% of my time in organizations working with seauite leaders and senior leaders. This this is how it works in organizations. how it works in political, you know, how it works in faith communities. This is how power works in general. So power over is a very specific kind of power. And it's especially dangerous because in order to maintain it, you have to engage in periodic bouts of cruelty towards vulnerable populations. You have to remind people what you're capable of.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你在《坚实地基》（Strong Ground）中谈到了领导力中的四种权力。有“权力凌驾”，即控制或剥削他人；“权力共生”，即寻找共同点并建立集体力量；“权力赋予”，即给予他人自主权并认识到他们的潜力；以及“内在权力”，即尊重差异和自我价值。那么，作为一名企业领导者，如果我想要成功，你是在告诉我需要远离“权力凌驾”并采纳这个列表中的其他权力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's four types of power you you you speak about in um Damn, you have that in your notes in Strong Ground. Yes. Well, why are you surprised? I don't know. There's four types of power in leadership you speak about. There's the power over, which is controlling or exploiting others. Power with finding common ground and building collective strength. Power two, which is giving others agency and recognizing their potential. And power within, which is honoring differences and selfworth. So as a leader of a business, if I want to be successful, are you telling me that I need to stay away from power over and adopt another power within this list of four?</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我认为我们看到长期以来非常成功的是“权力共生”、“权力赋予”和“内在权力”。也就是协作性权力、共同创造的权力、自我意识、元认知、了解自己、了解自己的思维和学习方式。所以“权力共生”和“权力赋予”非常重要。“权力凌驾”极难维持。我们的神经生物学结构决定了我们无法长时间处于恐惧之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think what we've seen be very successful over time is power with, power to, and power within. So collaborative power, co-creation power, self-awareness, metacognition, knowing yourself, knowing how you think and learn. So power with and power too. Power over is excruciatingly difficult to maintain. We're not neurobiologically hardwired to stay in fear for very long.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 所以如果我为你工作，而你用“权力凌驾”来领导我，你用我的工作来威胁我，用后果来威胁我，用降职来威胁我，从神经生物学的角度来看，我会有两种情况之一发生。我要么变得麻木，它将不再起作用，你无法维持，我也无法维持那种持续的恐惧水平，这在生理上要求太高了。或者我可能会变得过度常态化，我可能会觉得这就是我工作的环境，这很疯狂，但就是这样。但每隔一段时间，你就必须做一些事来向我展示你到底能有多混乱和残忍。就像，你必须进行周期性的残酷行为来提醒我恐惧是真实的，让我重新回到恐惧中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I work for you, if I work for you and you're using power over to lead me, you're threatening me with my job, you're threatening me with consequences, you're threatening me with demotion, one of two things is going to happen for me neurobiologically. I am either going to just become numb to it. It's not it's not going to be able you're not going to maintain I can't maintain that constant level of fear. just too demanding, just physically demanding. Or I might get hyper normalized. I might just like this is this is what I work in. This is like crazy. This is it, you know? But every now and then, you're going to have to do something that demonstrates to me how chaotic and cruel you can actually be. Like, you're going to have to engage in periodic acts of cruelty to remind me that the fear is real and to put me back in it.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 所以你现在看到的一些事情，比如在美国，驱逐和移民问题。这位总统在移民问题上的收紧程度并不比其他前任总统更甚，但我们从未见过蒙面人当街抓人，而孩子们抱着他们的腿尖叫：“妈妈，妈妈，妈妈。”我们从未见过那种场面，对吧？但我们有其他总统的驱逐人数可能超过了我们现在看到的，但我们从未见过那种程度的残忍和展示。那是一种真正的残忍展示，作为一种提醒，告诉人们谁掌握权力，谁没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so one of the things you're seeing right now, I mean, like we in in the US, the deportation and immigration issues. This is not a president that has, you know, tightened his belt on immigration more than other previous presidents, but we've never seen masked people grabbing people off the street while children hold on to their legs screaming, "Mom, mom, mom." We we we've never seen that before, right? But we've had other presidents probably exceed the deportation numbers that we're seeing, but we've never seen that level of cruelty and display. That is a real display of cruelty as a reminder of who who holds power and who does not.</p>
</details>

### 系统论：为何我们需要保持“边界渗透性”

**布琳·布朗:** 我是一个坚定的**系统论**（Systems Theory: 一种跨学科的理论，研究系统的整体性、关联性和动态性）信奉者。我接受过系统论的训练。我认为如果你不理解系统论，至少如果你现在正在领导一个组织，你将会落后。因为组织内外的复杂性如此之大，我们需要一个框架来理解所有这些独立的系统是如何相互碰撞的。你可能每天都会碰到上百个系统，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a big systems theory. I'm a systems theory person. I think in systems theory I was trained in systems theory. I think if you don't understand system systems theory, at least if you're leading an organization right now, you're going to fall behind because the complexity inside and outside of organizations is such that we need a framework to understand how all of these individual systems are bumping up against each other. Like you you probably bump up against a hundred systems a day, right?</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。所以我想象中关于你成功的故事，因为这对任何系统论都是成立的，那就是为了让系统繁荣和成长，它们必须保持可渗透的边界。这意味着它们必须允许反馈从其他系统流入和流出，以保持警觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so what I would imagine the story I would make up about your success because this is true of any systems theory is in order for systems to thrive and grow, they have to keep permeable boundaries. Meaning they have to allow feedback to flow in and out from other systems to be aware.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 一个健康的系统有可渗透的边界，意味着反馈一直在流入和流出。当世界变得复杂时，我们开始不想要反馈了。复杂性太大了。所以我们开始关闭那些可渗透的边界。那么，当一个系统的边界不再可渗透时会发生什么呢？它会萎缩。在萎缩的过程中，系统变得自我参照。我们好吗？我们很棒。我们对吗？我们是对的。我们达标了吗？我们达标了。因为系统的边界不再渴望外部反馈，即使反馈很刺耳。而在今天的商业环境中，地缘政治现实、市场变化、人工智能，我的意思是，这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So, a healthy system has permeable boundaries, meaning feedback is flowing in and out all the time. What happens when the world gets complex is we start not wanting the feedback. The complexity is too big. So we start shutting down those permeable boundaries. Well, what happens to a system where the boundaries are no longer permeable. It atrophies. And in the in the process of atrophying, the system becomes self-referencing. Are we good? We're great. Are we right? We're right. Are we on target? We're on target. because the boundaries of the system is are no longer craving outside feedback even when it's tough. And in businesses today, the geopolitical realities, the market changes, AI, I mean, it's crazy.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 因此，我们关闭不确定性和复杂性的倾向，是我们工作和生活所在系统面临的最大威胁。自我保护、关闭城墙、升起吊桥、用食人鱼填满护城河。我们根本没有那种奢侈。我们必须保持边界的可渗透性。我们必须不断学习、猜测、忘却、再学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so our predisposition to shut down uncertainty and complexity is the biggest threat to the systems in which we work and live. the self-protect, close the wall, put up the drawbridge, fill the moat with piranhas. We just don't have that luxury. We've got to keep the the boundaries permeable. We've got to keep learning, guessing, unlearning, relearning.</p>
</details>

### 算法时代的精神危机与认知主权

**主持人:** 另一个增加的复杂性是算法的兴起。当我想到由人工智能驱动的算法时，它们会更擅长知道你想看什么，以便你花更多时间，消费更多广告，这意味着可能给我看的最好的东西要么是真正可怕的东西，要么是确认我已有的信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the added complexities is the rise in algorithms. And and actually when I think about algorithms that are powered by AI, they're going to be even better at knowing what you want to see so that you spend time, so that you consume more adverts, which means probably the best thing to show me is either something really fearful or to to confirm what I already believe.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 100% 正确。

**主持人:** 一个做相反事情的算法，对普通人来说可能不是一个愉快的体验。它会引起太多的不协调和不适。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100%.</p>
<p class="english-text">An algorithm that was doing the opposite probably wouldn't be an enjoyable experience for the average human brain. It would cause too much dissonance, too much discomfort,</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 但对民主来说是好事。

**主持人:** 是的，非常好。但对经营企业和卖广告来说却很糟糕。所以任何采取这种方法的公司都会破产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but great for democracy.</p>
<p class="english-text">Great. Yeah. Fantastic. But terrible for for running a business and selling ads. So any company that takes that approach will go bankrupt.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 这很复杂。

**主持人:** 我同意。我不是在寻找一个简单的答案。说吧，给我点颜色看看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's complicated.</p>
<p class="english-text">Well, I agree. I'm not looking for an easy answer. Go ahead. Hit me.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我只是觉得这很复杂，因为一个客观的、只看这些人群激励机制的第三方会说，如果他们不做，中国会做。所以即使是现在的人工智能，你知道吗，我和所有这些专家坐在一起，我一直碰壁，那就是，好吧，如果我们禁止美国人追求这种超级智能战略，那么俄罗斯和中国就会先到那里，然后不幸的是，美国最终会成为中国的法国斗牛犬。实际上，我无法反驳这一点。我说，“不，你说的对。”因为你将不得不从他们那里租用技术。它将如此强大，并带来如此大的经济优势，以至于你将不得不从中国租用它。所以，好吧，我猜山姆·奥特曼确实需要加紧努力，否则……所以这很复杂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and I just think it's complicated because what what an objective party would say who's just looking at the incentives of these groups of people is if they don't do it, China will. So even with AI now, you know what I I'm like, I've sat with all these experts and I keep hitting up against this wall, which is, okay, if we just banned people in the United States from pursuing this super intelligence strategy, then Russia and China get there first, then the United States, unfortunately, are going to end up being China's French bulldog. And actually, I can't refute that. I go, "No, you're right." Cuz we you'd have to literally lease the technology off them. It will be so powerful and give such an economic advantage that you will have to lease it off China. So, okay, I guess Sam Alman does need to crack on or else so it's complicated.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我的意思是，你刚刚把它说清楚了。你刚刚把它说清楚了。我们情绪失调。我们互不信任。我们也不太相信自己。而且我们是脱节的。但我不能放弃人们。我不是那样的人。我只是相信我们善大于贪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Spiritual crisis. Yeah. I mean, you just laid it out. You just laid it out. We're emotionally disregulated. We're distrustful of each other. We don't trust ourselves very much. And we're disconnected. I can't give up on people, though. I'm not built that way. Like, I just believe that we are more good than greedy.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 你知道，我曾和特雷弗·诺亚在一个活动上交谈，我提到了一个让我非常兴奋的术语，他对此提出了挑战。我说，我认为我们需要的是**认知主权**（Cognitive Sovereignty: 指个人对自己信息消费、思维过程和注意力拥有控制权的能力）。我们需要从算法手中夺回控制权，决定我们消费什么、阅读什么、如何思考、批判性地思考。我们需要把我们的注意力和专注力看作是人们追求的商品，因为他们确实在追求这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I I was in conversation with Trevor Noah at an event and I mentioned this term that I I was really excited about and he challenged me on it and I said, I think what we need is cognitive sovereignty. We need to wrestle control away from the algorithms and decide what we consume, what we read, how we think, think critically. We need to think about our attention and our focus as commodities that people are after because they're after them, right?</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 他有一个有趣的观点。他总是说，“不，我们需要更少的认知主权，布琳。”我问：“你什么意思？”他说：“所有东西都是关于‘为你推荐’的页面。所有东西都是为你。我们需要的是社群主权。”他说：“你知道，整个问题在于你的‘为你推荐’页面是完全主权的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He had an interesting point though. He always has interesting points, don't you think? It's so tough to to talk to Trevor because he's so he's always got an interesting point. He's always got an interesting point. Damn it. Um and he's funny, but he said, "No, we need less cognitive sovereignty, Bnee." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "Everything's about the for you page. Everything's for you. We need communal sovereignty. He's like, you know, the whole problem is that your for you page is completely sovereign.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 让我告诉你最让我害怕的是什么。由于我工作的性质，我会进入一些奇怪的房间。我在一些房间里，那些运营这些平台、拥有这些企业 CEO 和创始人的大人物都在。我听到他们谈话，听到一些非常不一致的事情，让我感到恐慌。比如我听到有人说：“嘿，科技亿万富翁，我的孩子们应该学什么？我为我的孩子们担心。”他们会说：“嗯，他们应该学习编程、物理。”然后五分钟后，就好像那个回答没发生过一样，有人会问：“你认为你的成功归功于什么？当你深入思考时。”同一个人会说：“我深入阅读了哲学和斯多葛学派。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let me tell you what scares me the most. I'm in I'm in some weird rooms because of the nature of my job. I'm in rooms where the people who run these platforms and own and you know that own the CEOs of these business and the founders are in these rooms and I hear them talking and I hear things that are so misaligned that it panics me. So I hear someone say, "Hey, you know, tech billionaire, what what should my kids study? I'm worried for my kids." well they should study coding physics you know and then five minutes later as if that answer didn't happen someone will say to what do you attribute your success I mean deeply when you think about it and the same person will say my deep reading of philosophy in the stoics</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 然后我就在想，到底是哪个，伙计？然后我开始从那里推断，想知道是否正在出现一个“思考阶层”，他们会说：“我们要读哲学，我们要读文科，我们要研究历史，而你们其他人就继续刷手机吧。别担心那些大词。我们会为你们处理所有的大词。”这就像他们问史蒂夫·乔布斯：“天哪，你的孩子们一定很喜欢 iPad 吧。”史蒂夫·乔布斯说：“我的孩子们没有 iPad。”然后他的传记作者，曾和他的家人待过一段时间，说他不是在开玩笑。晚餐时没有科技产品。他们在谈论艺术和历史。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and so then I'm thinking to myself well which is it dude and then I then I start to extrapolate from there and wonder if there is a thinking class that's emerging where they're like, "We're going to read philosophy and we're going to read the liberal arts and we're going to study history and the rest of you just keep scrolling. Don't worry about the big words. We'll we'll handle all the big words for you." Like, it's like when they asked Steve Jobs, "Boy, your kids must love the iPad." Steve Jobs said, "My kids don't have an iPad." And then his biographer who spent time with his family said he wasn't kidding. There's no technology at dinner. They're talking about art and history.</p>

### 脆弱的真正定义：没有脆弱，就没有勇气

**主持人:** 脆弱性重要吗？因为现在有很多表演性的脆弱。成为一个脆弱的人对我的健康、幸福和未来重要吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 让我们先定义它。脆弱性是我们在面临不确定性、风险和情感暴露时体验到的情绪。所以脆弱性是我的感受。它是在不确定、风险或情感暴露时我感受到的那种畏缩、尴尬、那种情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is vulnerability important? Cuz there's a lot of performative vulnerability taking place in Is it an important thing for my health, happiness, my future to be a vulnerable person?</p>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's define it. Um vulnerability is the emotion we experience when we have when we are up against uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. So vulnerability is what I feel. It's the cringe, the awkward, the thing that I the emotion I feel in times of uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我很难帮助人们理解，因为我们从小被教育相信脆弱就是软弱。直到一次去布拉格堡与特种部队合作，我问士兵们一个问题：“给我一个你生命中勇气的例子。一个你亲眼目睹或亲身经历的例子。一个不需要不确定性、风险或情感暴露的勇气例子。”没有人能回答。最后，一个年轻的士兵站起来说：“三次任务。没有脆弱就没有勇气。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it was really interesting because I had a hard time helping people understand because there's we are so raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness that it took a trip to Fort Bragg working with special forces to ask soldiers a question. Give me a single example of courage in your life. One example that you've witnessed or you you yourself have done. One example of courage that did not require uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure. No one could answer it. Finally a young soldier stood up and said three tours. There is no courage without vulnerability.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 所以，脆弱性重要吗？如果我们想勇敢地生活，它就很重要。如果我们想以一种符合价值观和勇敢的方式管理自己，我们必须能够调和我们在不确定、有风险或暴露时的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. If we if we want to be able to manage ourselves in a way that's values aligned and courageous, we have to be able to reconcile how we feel when we're uncertain, at risk, or exposed.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 如果你在生活和工作中做的事情没有风险、没有不确定性、没有暴露，那么它们就不是勇敢的。如果你知道结果会怎样，那不是勇气。勇气是愿意在无法预测结果的情况下，全身心投入地出现。勇气是先说“我爱你”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, if you're doing things in your life, in your work, and there's no risk, no uncertainty, and no exposure, then they're not brave. If you know how it's going to end, that is not courage. Courage is a willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome. Courage is saying, "I love you first."</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 那就是你。你想知道什么是脆弱吗？先说“我爱你”。你有没有先说过“我爱你”？

**主持人:** 嗯，我不确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's you. You want to know what vulnerability is? I love you first. Have you ever said, "I love you first."</p>

**主持人:** 是的，已经很久了。

**布琳·布朗:** 但这很难。你知道的。

**主持人:** 是的。必须先开口。是的。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我讲过一个很棒的故事。我在这里做过一次演讲，实际上是在洛杉矶。之后，一个大概 22 或 23 岁的年轻人走过来对我说：“我能给你讲一个关于你的工作如何真正改变我生活的故事吗？”我说：“当然。”然后一群人围了过来。他说：“嗯，我当时在和一个女人约会，我为她疯狂。所以我带她去我们最喜欢的餐厅吃饭。我等到甜点上来，因为我们都喜欢那个巧克力火山，我点了它。然后我说，‘我爱你。’她看着我说，‘我觉得你很棒，但我们应该和别人约会。’然后她叫了辆优步回家了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Had to go first. Yeah.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, there's this great story that I tell about I I gave a talk here. I was actually in LA and afterwards a kid came up to me. He's probably 22 or 23 and he said can I tell you a story about your work and how it's really changed my life and I was like sure and a kind of a crowd grew around and this is like the last time I ever got pinned like not being able to exit a stage because it was such a traumatic it wasn't traumatic but it was like he said well I was dating this woman and I was so crazy about her so I took her to eat to our favorite restaurant and I waited until the dessert came cuz we love this chocolate volcano and I ordered it. And I said, "I love you." And she looked at me and she said, "I think you're awesome and I think we should date other people and then she Ubered home."</p>

**布琳·布朗:** 我当时想，“天哪，这是我听过的最糟糕的故事。这不是个好故事。”他说：“所以我上了车，开车回家，一路上我只是不断对自己说，‘去你的布琳·布朗。去你的布琳·布朗。’”

<p class="english-text">And so I was like, "God damn, this is the worst story I've ever heard. This is not a good story." And he said, "So I got in my car and I drove home and the whole way home I just kept saying to myself over and over, "Fuck Bnee Brown. [ __ ] Bernay Brown."</p>

**布琳·布朗:** 他说：“我回到家，走进我的公寓，推开门，我的两个室友都在上网，他们抬起头说，‘伙计，怎么了？’我说，‘我告诉她我爱她，她说我很棒。’我的一个室友看着我说，‘你他妈在想什么？’那不是那样运作的。当你走向她们时，她们会走开。所以，你总是要有点退缩，这样她们才会走向你。他说，‘哦，不，不。我不想成为那种人。’我是在勇敢地挑战。”他说他的两个室友都热泪盈眶，说：“说得对，兄弟。说得对。”没有脆弱就没有勇气。如果你不把自己置于风险之中，你怎么能说自己勇敢呢？

<p class="english-text">Like, when when does this when when's the turn on the story, you know? And he said, "I got home and I walked into my apartment and I pushed the door open and both my roommates were wired in and they were on their computers and they looked up and said, "Dude, what's going on?" And he said, "I told her I loved her and she told me I was awesome." And one of my roommates looked at me and said, "What the [ __ ] were you thinking?" That's not how it works. When you are going toward them, they go away. So, you're always kind of going away. So, they come toward you. And he goes, "Oh, oh, no, no. I don't want to I don't want to be that dude." I was daring greatly. And he said both of his roommates just got teary eyed and went, "Right on, man. Right on." Like, there is no courage without vulnerability. How can you say you're brave if you're not putting yourself out there?</p>

### 信任的建立：大理石罐理论

**布琳·布朗:** 很多人都经历过一些事情，让他们很难变得脆弱。

**主持人:** 我昨天和一个人聊天，她被出卖过，童年早期有很多依恋问题。有趣的是，当我和她谈论……我问她关于她经历过的事情等等，她就封闭起来了。她告诉我，她认为脆弱是一种她试图远离的亲密形式，因为她需要非常非常非常信任一个人，才会敞开心扉。我想这是很多人都有的趋势。他们不会足够敞开心扉去建立联系，因为他们以前因为敞开心扉而受过伤，再次这样做感觉太可怕了。这导致他们单身、孤独、不快乐等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So many people have been through things which have made it very, very difficult for them to be vulnerable.</p>
<p class="english-text">I was speaking to someone yesterday who was cheated on bunch of attachment issues in their early childhood. And funnily enough, when I was talking to her about I was asking her questions about cuz I'm very deep person. This carries over into my personal life. I was asking her questions about the things, you know, she'd been through whatever else, she just shuts down. And she told me that she she um what were the exact words? She said that she finds vulnerability to be a form of intimacy that she tries to stay away from because she needs to really really really trust the person before she opens up. And I think this is a trend you see across a lot of people. They they won't open up enough to form a connection because they've been hurt before by opening up and it feels too scary to do that. And that results in them being single, alone, unhappy, so on and so on.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我的意思是，你说的 loaded with so many things。首先，脆弱和信任之间存在一种非常有趣的关系，它是如何运作的？人们总是问我，信任和脆弱哪个先来。是我先信任你，然后我变得脆弱，还是我先脆弱，然后我信任你？我认为这是一个非常缓慢的堆叠过程。我们互相了解。我分享一点点。我不会分享，“嘿，很高兴认识你，史蒂芬。这是我最黑暗、最可怕、最痛苦的创伤。”你知道，因为那种试探实际上是一种盔甲。我要向你扔一些我们关系根本还没建立到足以承受的东西。你会走开，然后我会用这个来验证脆弱是危险的。那是试探。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think there's there what you said was so loaded with so many things. So, first of all, there's the there there's this very interesting relationship between vulnerability and trust and how does that work? And people always ask me what comes first, trust or vulnerability. Do I trust you first, then I'm vulnerable, or am I vulnerable first and then I trust you? And I think it's a very slow stacking. We get to know each other. I share a little bit. I don't I don't share, hey, nice to meet you, Stephen. Here's my darkest, horrible, most painful trauma. You know, cuz that that is actually that kind of litmus testing is actually a form of armor. I'm going to throw something at you that our relationship in no way has been built long enough to hold. You're going to go away and I'm going to use that as verification that vulnerability is dangerous. Like that's litmus testing.</p>

**布琳·布朗:** 脆弱，信任，脆弱，信任，脆弱，信任。

**主持人:** 我听说过你的“大理石罐理论”。我这里有一罐大理石。

**布琳·布朗:** 我看到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've heard about your marble jar theory. So, I got a jar of marbles.</p>
<p class="english-text">I saw that.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你能给我解释一下你的大理石罐……看你多兴奋？

**布琳·布朗:** 我知道。这个故事来自我女儿艾伦四年级的时候。她从学校回家，关上前门，沿着门滑下来，瘫成一团，抽泣着。我问她怎么了。她说发生了一件难过的事，她在课间休息时很信任地告诉了一两个朋友。当她回到教室时，她们已经告诉了班上所有的同学，所有 30 个孩子都在嘲笑她，指指点点。她说：“我再也不会相信任何人了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, could you explain to me what your marble jar? Look at how excited you are.</p>
<p class="english-text">I know. Um, so this comes you know where where is where where do I get my information? Ellen's in fourth grade, my oldest. She comes home from school. The front door closes. She slides down the door into a heap, sobbing. Oh my god, Ellen, are you okay? Are you hurt? What's going on? She says that something hard happened. She shared it like very confidentially with one or two of her friends during recess. When she got back to the classroom, they had told everybody in her class, all 30 kids, everybody was laughing and pointing and making fun of her. And she said, "I will never trust anyone again."</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我当时的第一反应是，“说得对，一个混蛋都别信。你只要相信你妈妈就行了。”但那不是正确的做法，对吧？你希望孩子能与他人建立信任。所以我说：“信任真的很难。”她说：“我不懂。”当时她的老师博克姆夫人有一个大理石罐。当全班同学集体做出好的决定时，她会往空罐子里放弹珠，装满后他们就会有额外的课间休息和派对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And my response immediately to my in my mind was, "Damn straight, not a [ __ ] person. You trust your mama." And that's it. Like that was my response. But again, that's not the right thing to do, right? You want a kid who can develop trust with others. So I said, "Trust is really hard." She said, "I don't understand it." And her teacher at the time, Mrs. Bockam, had a mar a marble jar. And when the team when the when the class would collectively make good decisions, she would put marbles in this empty jar, and when it got full, they'd have an extra recess and party.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 我立刻想到，因为我正在向一个四年级学生描述信任这个困难的概念。我说：“信任就是那个大理石罐。”她说：“你什么意思？”我说：“每次你和别人分享一些机密的事情，而他们没有泄露，他们就得到一颗弹珠。每次你建立信任，当你想分享一些非常私密和个人的事情时，你就去找一个罐子里装满弹珠的朋友。你有任何大理石罐朋友吗？”她说：“今天我分享的那些不是。”我说：“谁是你的大理石罐朋友？”她说：“汉娜和洛娜。”我说：“告诉我她们做了什么来赢得弹珠。”“哦，比如如果我午餐时去拿餐盘晚了，没有地方坐，洛娜会挪过去给我半个座位，然后我们就共享一个座位，我就可以坐在桌子旁了。还有前几天我得了链球菌性喉炎，汉娜很担心我。所以记得她妈妈打电话说，‘汉娜很担心艾伦。她为什么没来上学？’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so immediately what came to me, because I'm describing trust, which is a hard concept to a fourth grader. I said, "Trust is the marble jar." She's like, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Every time you share somebody something with someone that's confidential and they don't share it, they get a marble. Every time you build trust, when you want to share something really private and personal, you look for a friend whose jar is full of marbles. Do you have any marble jar friends?" She's like, "Not the ones I shared with today." And I said, "Who are your marble jar friends?" And she said, "Hannah and Lorna." And I said, "Tell me something they do to earn marbles." Oh, well like if I get to my tray late at lunch and there's no place to sit, Lorna will scoot over and give me half her seat and then we just share one seat and I can sit at the table. And then the other day when I had strep throat, Hannah was worried about me. So remember her mom called and said, "Hannah's worried about Ellen. Why wasn't she at school?"</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 但汉娜做的最重要的一件事是前几天，我的外公外婆来我的足球比赛，汉娜看过去说：“哦天哪，你的外公外婆来了。”我说：“那为什么是件大事？”她说：“因为大家的父母都离婚再婚了，我有八个，你知道，四对人。”她记住了他们的名字。让我震惊的是，艾伦在传达这些弹珠是通过这些非常微小的事情赢得的。她知道我祖父母的名字。她给我一个座位坐。她在我缺课时关心我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then the biggest thing that Hannah did was the other day and Opa, my parents, my mom and her her husband came to my soccer game and Hannah looked over and goes, "Oh my god, your ma and Opa are here." And I said, "Why was that a big deal?" And she goes, "Because everybody's divorced and remarried and I've got eight, you know, four sets of people." And she remembered their names. And what was shocking to me is that Ellen was conveying that these marbles were being earned on these very small. She knew my grandparents' name. She gave me a seat to sit at. She checked on me when I was missing school.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 这让我开始思考关于信任的文献。所以我立刻去查了戈特曼夫妇的研究。你请过戈特曼夫妇来这里吗？

**主持人:** 哦，两次。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it made me start thinking about the literature on trust. So I immediately go to the Gottman's. Have you had the Gottmans on here?</p>
<p class="english-text">Oh, twice. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。所以我去查了戈特曼夫妇关于信任的研究。我立刻读到戈特曼说，信任是在每天的微小瞬间中赢得的。他讲了一个故事，是我最喜欢的故事。他说他也是个悬疑小说爱好者。他正在读一本悬疑小说的倒数第二页，心想：“哦天哪，哦天哪，谁干的？”他跳起来去刷牙，走到浴室，看到他妻子在哭，一边梳头。他心想：“该死，别看。一切都好。就去浴室，然后回去看你的书。”他说：“那是一个**滑动门时刻**（Sliding Door Moment: 由心理学家约翰·戈特曼提出的概念，指关系中一个微小的选择点，这个选择可以建立信任，也可以导致背叛）。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, just like Yeah. So I go to the Gottman's research on trust. And I read right off the bat where Gottman say trust is earned in small moments every day. He tells a story. It's my favorite story that he tells and I've had them on my podcast and I've done blurbs for their books and written forwards. They're just great. So, he tells a story about how he's also a mystery lover like me. He's on the second to last page of his mystery. He's like, "Oh my god, oh my god." Like, who did it? And he jumps up to go brush his teeth and he gets walks to the bathroom and he sees his wife crying and brushing her hair. He's like, "Shit, don't look. Everything's good. Just go to the bathroom and get back in your get back to your book." And he's like, "That's a sliding door moment.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** “在那一刻我有一个选择。建立信任，停下来问‘怎么了？’或者建立背叛，假装没看见她受伤。所以我停下来，从她手中接过梳子，开始帮她梳头，问‘怎么了？’”那是一个我们时时刻刻都会遇到的滑动门时刻，对吧？所以对我来说，信任是随着时间慢慢建立的，一次一颗弹珠。这就是我们教给财富 100 强公司最高层领导者关于信任的方法。信任是一个大理石罐。它是挣来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can I have a choice in that moment. to build trust and stop and say what's going on or to build betrayal and pretend like I don't see her hurting. So I stop I take the brush out of her hand. I start brushing her hair and say, "What's going on?" That's a sliding door moment that we have all the time, right? And so to me, trust is built slowly over time, a marble at a time. And that's how that's how we teach trust to the most senior leaders in Fortune 100 companies. That trust is a marble jar. It's earned.</p>

### 快乐为何如此脆弱？

**布琳·布朗:** 无论盔甲为何而存在，没有脆弱，你就无法体验生活中最有意义的经历。爱。爱一个人就是从你醒来到你睡觉都处于脆弱之中。你知道你在一段关系中。去爱就是脆弱，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">regardless of why the armor is on, without vulnerability, you cannot access the experiences that are the most meaningful in life. Love. To love someone is to be vulnerable from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed. You know that you're in a relationship. To love is to be vulnerable, right?</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 你有没有埋葬过你爱的人？没有。就像我两年前失去了我的母亲。我的孩子们，就像我的心脏活在我的身体之外。去爱就是脆弱，因为要冒着悲伤和失去的风险。归属感是脆弱的。最脆弱的人类情感是喜悦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And have you ever buried someone you loved? No. Like I lost my mom two years ago. Like my kids, it's like having your heart live outside of your body. Like to love is to be vulnerable cuz it's to risk grief and losing. Belonging is vulnerable. The most the most vulnerable human emotion, joy.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于我们中的一些人接近它时，会预演悲剧，为失望做准备。它如此脆弱，以至于我们甚至不让自己感受喜悦，因为我们太害怕有人会把它夺走，我们会被失望打个措手不及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joy is so vulnerable that when some of us get close to it, we dress rehearse tragedy to prepare for disappointment. Like it's so vulnerable that we don't even let ourselves feel joy because we're so afraid someone's going to rip it away and we're going to get sucker punched by disappointment.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 是或不是？人们宁愿活在失望中，也不愿冒险感受失望，为某事感到兴奋。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我们称之为“预感喜悦的厄运”。那份喜悦太美好了，就等着另一只鞋子掉下来。有创伤史的人尤其如此。对我来说，因为我的成长方式，当好事发生时，我会想：“哦天哪，现在会发生什么？”从统计学上看，坏事随时都可能发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes or no? Like people choose to live disappointed rather than to feel disappoint. risk feeling disappointed and get excited about something.</p>
<p class="english-text">we call it foroding joy. That joy is so good just waiting for the other shoe to drop. And people who have trauma histories are really like that. Like for me, because the way I was raised, when something good happens, I'm like, "Oh god, now what's going to happen?" Statistically, bad shit's going to roll around any second now.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 有趣的是，在我们研究的人群中，唯一能接受那种……你知道，有一种脆弱的身体颤抖，对吧？你感受过吗？

**主持人:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's interesting because the group of people that we research, the only group of people that could take that, you know, there's a bodily quiver, right, of vulnerability. Have you felt it?</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 唯一能持续投入喜悦的人，是那些把那种脆弱的颤抖作为提醒，去感恩，去在那一刻练习感恩的人。所以感恩是喜悦的一个巨大促成因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The only people that can really lean into joy consistently are people who use that vulnerability quiver as a reminder to be grateful to be able to practice gratitude in that second. So gratitude is a huge enabler of joy.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 那是自动的还是可以训练的？

**布琳·布朗:** 不，那是一种训练。哦天哪，我必须……我的意思是，站在我家前门，看着我 16 岁的女儿和她的高中男友走在人行道上，坐上他的卡车去参加舞会，对吧？我站在那里，心想：“哦天哪。”你知道，我在担心什么？舞会之夜，车祸，对吧？当然，当我讲这个故事时，军方的人总是说：“怀孕。”我说：“不不不不不，车祸。”我记得我站在那里，她上了车，我站在史蒂夫和查理旁边，我儿子当时 10 岁。我心想，我太感激了。我太感激了。我为这一刻感到感激。我感激自己是其中的一部分。我感激他们在这里弄了胸花和纽扣花。我感激我能帮忙挑选礼服。我太感激了。然后查理看着史蒂夫说：“妈妈怎么了？”史蒂夫说：“她在练习感恩。让她做吧，不然她会发疯的，然后就会全是健康问题……”你知道，因为我的一部分想说：“哦天哪，哦天哪，这太美好了，太喜悦了，现在就上你的卡车跟着他们，如果他超速了我想知道，如果他在停车标志前没有完全停下，跟着他们直到这次约会结束。”你知道，那是我真正想做的，因为我害怕，因为那一刻的喜悦对我来说太强烈了，太脆弱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that automatic or can one train that?</p>
<p class="english-text">No, it's a training. Oh [ __ ] know I had to I I I mean standing at my front door watching my 16-year-old daughter walk down the sidewalk with her boyfriend in high school and get in his truck for for prom, right? And I'm standing there and I'm like, "Oh god." And you know, what am I worried about? You know, prom night, like car wreck, right? Of course, when I when I tell the story, the military is always like, "Pregnancy." I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no. car wreck. And so I just remember staying there and she gets in and and I'm staying next to Steve and Charlie, my my son's, you know, at this time he's 10. And I'm like, I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful. I'm grateful for this moment. I'm grateful that I'm a part of it. I'm grateful that they did the CR and the bineir over here. I'm grateful that I got to help pick out the dress. I'm so grateful. And Charlie goes looks at Steve. What's wrong with mom? Um and Steve goes, she's she's practicing gratitude. let her do it otherwise she's going to get on a crazy train and it's going to be all health and you know like because part of me wants to say oh god oh god like it's so beautiful and so joyful and get in your truck and follow them right now if he's speeding I want to know about it if he's not stopping fully to stop sign follow them until this date is over you know that's that's what I want to do because I'm afraid because that the joy of that moment was just too much for me too vulnerable</p>

### 克服，还是共存？

**主持人:** 你有克服过任何事吗？

**布琳·布朗:** 有。我相信我能克服任何事的这个信念。我已经克服了那个信念，即我相信我将永远到达终点。我感激我拥有的新技能，这些技能让我更接近我想成为的人、母亲、伴侣和领导者。但我时刻提醒自己，当我害怕时我很可怕，我很容易灾难化，这对周围的每个人都很痛苦，而且我不需要被喜欢，我只需要做我自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you overcome anything?</p>
<p class="english-text">Yes. The belief that I will overcome anything. I have overcome the belief that I have overcome the belief that I will ever arrive. I am grateful for the skills that I have that are new skills that keep me more aligned with the person, the mom, the partner, the leader that I want to be. But I I am mindful all the I try to stay very mindful that I am scary when I'm scared that I catastrophize very very easily and that's painful for everybody around me and I don't need to be liked. I just need to be myself.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 有些人可能会觉得这有点令人沮丧，知道他们也可能永远无法治愈自己迫切想要改变的部分。我认为人们，你知道，他们经常来听这样的播客或读像你这样的书，寻找解决不喜欢自己、对自己情绪反应方式的办法。他们想修复它，因为如果他们能修复它，他们就能快乐。

**布琳·布朗:** 我认为这不在考虑范围之内，原因很美妙。如果我们能修复它，并且再也不用与之斗争，我们对别人的宽容就会非常少，我们就会成为暴君。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people might find that somewhat demoralizing to know that they they too might never cure parts of themselves that they're desperate to change. I think people, you know, they often come to podcasts like this or read books like yours looking for sol fix fixes to not liking myself to the way that I react to my emotions. They want to fix it cuz if they can fix it, then they can be happy.</p>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that's in the consideration set for a very beautiful reason that if we could fix it and never have to wrestle with it, we would be so short on grace for other people that we would be tyrants.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 所以你认为这会产生一种对他人的同理心？

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。我的意思是，我不会……我有非常严肃的界限。我是一个非常有界限感的人。但是当我看到某人以某种方式行事时，我会想：“我的内在混蛋看到了你的内在混蛋。我懂。我明白你在做什么。我不会容忍它。我会为此设定一个界限，但我不会真的因此评判你。只是那种行为在这里是不可以的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you think it it creates a form of empathy for others?</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, like I'm not going to I have like really serious boundaries. I'm a very boundary person. But when I see someone behaving a certain way, I was like, "My [ __ ] sees your inner [ __ ] right here. I I get it. I get what you're doing. I'm not going to tolerate it. I'm going to set a boundary around it, but I'm not really judging you for it. It's just that behavior is not okay right here.</p>

### 终身课题：卸下自我保护的盔甲

**主持人:** 但你现在喜欢自己了。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。是的，我喜欢。我……是的，我喜欢。我可以说得相当……我喜欢我正在成为的样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you like yourself now.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, I do. I I Yeah, I do. I do. I can I can I think I can say that pretty I like what I'm becoming.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 对于任何不喜欢自己的人，需要做些什么工作才能达到你喜欢自己正在成为的样子的地步？

**布琳·布朗:** 我认为最难的，也许是我过去 25 年研究中最大的发现之一，是阻碍我们勇敢地面对生活和工作的不是恐惧，而是盔甲。每个人都会害怕。害怕是正常的。危险的是我们在害怕时为自我保护而伸向的盔甲。以及那副盔甲如何使我们远离爱、联结和我们的价值观。所以我认为最艰难的工作是，对我来说，不断地意识到我的盔甲是什么？当我害怕时，我抓住了什么？当我想要保护我的自我价值、我的自尊时，我抓住了什么？以及那东西有多重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for anyone that doesn't like themselves, what what work has had to go into getting to the point where you like what you be you're becoming?</p>
<p class="english-text">I think the hardest is maybe one of the biggest findings of my research over the last 25 years is it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's armor. Everybody's afraid. It's okay to be afraid. What's dangerous is the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And so I think the hardest work is for me constantly being aware of what is my armor? What am I what am I grabbing for when I'm afraid? What am I grabbing for when I want to protect my sense of self-worth, my ego? Like, and and how heavy that [ __ ] is.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 在某个时候，我必须穿上它，因为那是我成长过程中的生存之道。但这是中年时期一个重大的发展里程碑，也就是宇宙抓住你的肩膀，把你拉得很近，说：“我不再开玩笑了。他们给了你天赋。选择不成长为它们不是无害的。那是有后果的，而你的盔甲正在碍事。你现在是个成年人了。你有不同的选择。放开那些不再为你服务的东西。”我认为这是我们在中年时期必须努力解决的重大里程碑。什么东西不再服务于我们，阻止我们成长为我们想成为的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, at some point I had to wear it because that was survival for me growing up. But this is the big this is the big developmental milestone of middle age which you are squarely entering which is kind of when the universe grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you really close and says I'm not [ __ ] around anymore. They gave you gifts. Choosing not to grow into them is not benign. There's a consequence for that and your armor is getting in the way. You're a grown ass person now. You have different choices. Let go of what doesn't serve. And that is the big milestone I think that we have to wrestle with in midlife. What no longer serves that's preventing us from growing into who we want to be.</p>

### 通往勇气的四个核心技能

**主持人:** 在这种情况下，要勇敢，无论是作为领导者还是在其他环境中，你谈到了通往勇气的四个步骤。你在《坚实地基》中谈到了这一点。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。这是大约 15 年前出现的研究。我当时非常紧张，因为我是一名扎根理论研究者，一名定性研究者。所以一个扎根理论的好坏取决于它处理新数据的能力。你根据数据发展出一个假设或理论，然后当你收集更多数据时，看这个假设是否成立。你知道，我们是在大流行前收集的那些数据，在很多事情发生之前。所以我非常担心关于勇气的四个技能组合，它们是：

**布琳·布朗:** 一，识别和理解你的核心价值观。二，理解是什么阻碍你与脆弱性搏斗，即拥有它并建设性地度过它。三，如何建立信任，以及如何变得对自己极其重要地值得信赖，即自我信任。因为失败、失望或挫折的首批受害者之一是我们失去了信任自己的能力，我们做出好决定的能力，我们照顾自己的能力。最后一个，是我最喜欢的，因为我看到它能真正改变一个组织，那就是如何在失败和失望后重新站起来。如何重置，如何在困难发生时管理自己的反弹。

<p class="english-text">identifying and understanding your core values. I would love to do this exercise with you sometime. Um two, understanding what gets in the way of you wrestling with vulnerability, kind of owning it and moving through it constructively. Three, how to build trust and how to become super important trustworthy to yourself, selfrust. Because one of the first casualties of failure or disappointment or setback is we lose our our ability to trust ourselves, our ability to make good decisions, our ability to take care of ourselves. And the last one, which is my favorite because it can really I've seen it really change an organization is how to get back up after failure and disappointment. How to reset, how to be how to manage your own bounce when hard [ __ ] happens.</p>

**布琳·布朗:** 所以这就是勇气的四个技能组合。再次强调，它们是基于证据的、可观察的、可测量的和可教的。我们已经带领 45 个国家的 16.5 万人完成了这项工作，并收集了所有数据。这太令人兴奋了。它经受住了过去 5 年所有复杂的变化，包括人工智能，在组织层面，因为这是我们工作的地方。我不是治疗师或临床医生。我不与家庭或个人合作。我的意思是，我有治疗师，但我自己不是。所以我认为你可以培养勇气技能。

<p class="english-text">So those are the four skill sets of courage. Again, evidence-based, observable, measurable, and teachable. We've taken 165,000 people through this work across 45 countries, collected data on all of it. It's so exciting. And it withtood all of the complex changes over the last 5 years, including AI, organizationally, because this is where we do our work. I don't I'm not a therapist or clinician. I don't work with like families or individuals. I mean, I have a therapist, but I'm not one. Um, so I think you can develop SC courage skills.</p>

**主持人:** 圣诞节那天。

<p class="english-text">Christmas Day.</p>
<p class="english-text">My mom died on Christmas Day after my sisters and I were their her primary caregiver for four years with dementia.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 四年。

**布琳·布朗:** 我不会把那种事希望发生在我最恨的人身上。我尽量不恨人，但上帝偶尔会给我恩典。但我不会希望任何人经历那种事。你知道，现实就是那样。你知道，她到了那里，发生了意外，你在给你妈妈洗澡，你在给你妈妈沐浴，而她知道的刚好够让她为此感到羞辱。

<p class="english-text">Four years.</p>
<p class="english-text">I wouldn't wish that [ __ ] on the people I hate the most. I I try not to hate people, but I God gives me grace for it on occasion. But um I would not wish that on anybody. You know, there's the reality of it. You know, she gets there, there's an accident, you're showering your mom, you're bathing your mom, you know, and she knows just enough to be humiliated by it.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 但这就是生活。这就是照顾。你知道，这是一种巨大的情感、身体和精神负担，主要落在同时还在工作的女性身上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But this is life. Like this is this is caregiving, you know, and it's a tremendous emotional, physical, mental weight that falls primarily on women who are also in the workforce.</p>

**主持人:** 几乎要了你的命。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的，它……失去你爱的人，就像我爱我的妈妈，一点一滴，一砖一瓦，你知道，就像那样，然后有一天，她变得极其、极其残忍。就像我妈妈是支点。我们的家庭在她的背上改变了。她是我们家第一个去看心理治疗的人。她离开了我爸爸。她让我们接受治疗。她打三份工。她改变了一切。她谈到了我们家族悠久的成瘾史，你知道，双方都有。她改变了我们的家庭。所以说她是我尊敬和敬畏的人，这是一种轻描淡写的说法。

<p class="english-text">it almost killed you. I mean, yeah, it it to lose someone that you love, like I love my mom in bits and pieces, in chips and bones in, you know, like that is, you know, and then there was a day when she just got incredibly incredibly cruel. Like my mom was the fulcrum. Our family changed on her back. like she was the first person to go to therapy. She left my dad. She got us into therapy. She worked three jobs. She she changed everything. She talked about the long history of addiction in our family, you know, on both sides everywhere. She changed our family. And so to say she was like, you know, somebody who I respected and revered like was is an understatement.</p>
</details>

**布琳·布朗:** 然后有一天我去看她，我看到了那个我从 14 岁起就没见过的东西，你知道，而我已经 54 岁了。那真的就像……我开不了车，它让我身体上跪倒在地，就像我丈夫必须来接我。我不喜欢……我无法谈论它而不动情，因为我不是在责怪我妈妈，因为她正处于这种疾病之中，你知道，但那就像……在那之后我两个月没见她。史蒂夫一直说，我说我做不到。他说，你必须从中恢复过来。我的意思是，想象一下被扔回你 13 或 14 岁时最糟糕的情景中。然后，你知道，你只是想，我做不到，我做不到。然后，你知道，我的姐妹们会说，我来，我们来，我们来。然后她们会经历一段时期，她们会说，我现在不行。然后，好吧，我来。但史蒂夫总是在。史蒂夫会说，我来换尿布。我带他去吃饭。我会和医生会面。那就是伙伴关系。你明白我的意思吗？那就是伙伴关系。

<p class="english-text">and the one day I went to go take care of her and I saw that thing that I hadn't seen since I was 14, you know, and I'm 54, you know, and it literally like I couldn't drive like it brought me physically to my knees like like my husband had to come and get me. And I don't like like I can I can't talk about it without getting emotional cuz it's not like I blamed my mom because she's in the middle of this disease, you know, but it was like I I didn't see her for 2 months after that. And Steve kept saying I I said I can't. And he's like, you got to you got to heal from that. I mean, just imagine being dropped back in a worst case scenario situation when you were 13 or 14. And then, you know, you're just like, I can't I can't. And, you know, my sisters were like, I got we got we got this. And then they'd go through a period where they were like, I can't right now. And then, okay, I got it. But Steve always had it. Steve was like, I got the diaper. I'll take him to dinner. I'll meet with the doctors. Like, that's partnership. You know what I mean? That's partnership.</p>

**主持人:** 你是如何处理悲伤的？

**布琳·布朗:** 嗯……别给我寄你的仇恨邮件，混蛋们。但是，你知道，当她去世时，那只有解脱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did How did you deal with the grief?</p>
<p class="english-text">Well, don't send me your hate mail, [ __ ] But, you know, when she died, it was nothing but relief.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我听说过这个。我从未从一个有患痴呆症父母去世的人那里听到过不同的说法。

**布琳·布朗:** 是的。完全是解脱。我的意思是，她去世的前一天，我想我们和她度过了一段非常重要的时光。悲伤的窗口是多年的。你知道，很早以前，就不能打电话给她说：“哦，查理有个很可爱的约会对象。让我给你看返校节的照片。”或者，“嘿，艾伦，你知道，她被她的硕士项目录取了。”那一切都消失了，每周都是如此。

<p class="english-text">I've heard this. I've never not heard that from someone that had a parent with struggling with dementia and passing.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It was completely relief. I mean, the day before she died, I think we had a really important time with her, and I'm sure she is, you know, playing dominoes with Anne Richards and Molly Ivans and great other female Texas politicians, um, Democrats. But um because my mom was very radically political, but uh the window of grief was just years of there. There was, you know, very early on there was no calling her to say, "Oh, Charlie got a really cute date. Let me show you the homecoming pictures." Or, "Hey, Ellen, you know, got into her master's program." That that all just went away just every week.</p>
