summary: 著名研究学者布琳·布朗深入探讨了当代社会面临的“精神危机”。她指出，阻碍我们勇敢生活的不是恐惧，而是我们为自我保护而穿上的“盔甲”。布朗剖析了脆弱性与勇气的内在联系，解释了“权力掌控”的危险性，并提出了“弹珠罐理论”来阐释信任的建立。她强调，真正的归属感始于接纳自我，即使这意味着有时需要独自一人站立。这篇访谈为理解人际连接、个人成长和社会动态提供了深刻的见解。

title: 布琳·布朗：我们正处于一场精神危机——解析勇气、脆弱性与真正的归属感
---
### 导言：盔甲、脆弱性与勇气
主持人：你是我们收到最多点播要求的嘉宾。

布琳·布朗：让我告诉你，这次对谈并不轻松，因为我们触及了一些艰难的领域。但我认为我们所谈论的话题，其重要性无与伦比。因为阻碍我们在生活和工作中勇敢前行的，并非恐惧本身，而是我们在害怕时为自我保护而伸向的盔甲。

<p class="english-text">You are the single most requested guest. And let me tell you, this has not been easy because we went to some hard places. But I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this. Cuz it's not fear that gets in the way of us being brave with our lives and our work. It's the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid.</p>
</details>

那些盔甲使我们远离爱、连接和我们的价值观。最艰难的工作，就是意识到当自己害怕时，我的盔甲是什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And the hardest work is being aware of what is my armor when I'm afraid.</p>
</details>

主持人：那这是自动的吗？

布琳·布朗：哦，不。这是一种训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that automatic? Oh, no. It's a training.</p>
</details>

主持人：布琳·布朗是一位偶像级人物，她在羞耻、脆弱性和连接领域的全球领先研究，激励了像皮克斯、谷歌和美国特种部队这样的公司，去培养更强大的领导者，并帮助普通人释放他们的全部潜力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Brené Brown is an icon whose world-leading research in shame, vulnerability, and connection has inspired companies like Pixar, Google, and the US special forces to build stronger leaders and help the everyday person unlock their full potential.</p>
</details>

主持人：脆弱性重要吗？

布琳·布朗：如果我们想在生活中勇敢前行，它就重要。但我们从小被教育，认为脆弱就是软弱。比如在我的家庭里，我们被允许愤怒，但悲伤不是一个选项。你必须坚强。所以当我害怕、焦虑、失望时，我只会表现出愤怒。当你在没有脆弱性的环境中长大，这会让你处于危险之中。你想知道什么是脆弱性吗？喜悦。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于人们宁愿选择活在失望中，也不愿为某件事感到兴奋，去冒险被失望重击。因为没有脆弱性就没有勇气，勇气就是当你无法预测结果时，仍愿意全身心投入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. But we were raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness. Like in my family, we were allowed anger, but sad was not an option. You needed to be tough. And so when I get scared, when I feel anxious, disappointed, I'm just angry. And so when you're raised without vulnerability, it'll put you in jeopardy. Like, you want to know what vulnerability is? Joy. Joy is so vulnerable that people choose to live disappointed rather than to get excited about something and risk getting sucker punched by disappointment. Like, there is no courage without vulnerability because courage is the willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome.</p>
</details>

主持人：哇。我以前从未想过这一点。但你可以培养技能。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Wow. I've never thought about that before. But you can develop skills.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我们已经带领 165,000 人完成了这项工作，其中包括如何建立信任。

主持人：我听说过你的“弹珠罐理论”。

布琳·布朗：我知道。我们就是这样向《财富》100 强公司最高层的领导者传授信任的。这太棒了。

### 童年经历：在功能失调中学会“过度警觉”

主持人：为了理解你所做的所有工作、你对世界的看法，以及你在很多方面为何如此与众不同，我想了解你最早的成长环境，你来自哪里，是什么塑造了你，这可能很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In order to understand all the work that you have done and the perspective that you have on the world and also who you are as a anomaly in many respects, I think it's probably important that I understand your earliest context, where you've come from, what shaped you.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我卡在“我是个异类吗？”这个问题上了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm stuck on am I an anomaly?</p>
</details>

主持人：你当然是。这应该不让你惊讶。我的意思是，如果看你的成就，你的成就是非凡的。所以人们会假设，是某种因素让你成为了一个异类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course you're an anomaly. Of course you're an anomaly. That that should be of no surprise to you. I mean, if you look at your outcomes, your outcomes are anomalous. So, one would assume that there's some form of something that made you an anomaly.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我想说，我是第五代德州人。我来自一个相当功能失调的家庭。父母用他们所知的一切尽力而为。他们俩都来自非常非常艰难的成长环境，包括贫穷和成瘾。所以，你可能会想到的关于第五代德州人的许多刻板印象——坚强、不哭——我们被允许的情感范围非常小，要么是愤怒，要么是“还行”。愤怒是可以的，但你不能真的悲伤，脆弱性是不存在的。脆弱性是软弱和可怕的，会让你陷入危险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say that I'm a fifth generation Texan. I came from a fair amount of dysfunction. Parents doing the best they could with what they knew. both coming from really really really tough upbringings that included you know poverty addiction and so probably a lot of the stereotypes you would think about fifth generation Texan tough don't cry we were allowed a very small continuum of emotions were approval you know or approved which were pissed off or okay like anger was okay but no you couldn't be sad really or vulnerability was not a thing. Vulnerability was weakness and scary and puts you in jeopardy.</p>
</details>

无论在家里还是在学校，我都感觉自己像个局外人，但我非常擅长解读人、解读情境。我想，一路走来，有位治疗师曾说：“是的，那是**过度警觉**（Hypervigilance: 一种增强的感觉敏感状态，伴随着对威胁的夸大关注）。”你处于过度警觉状态。我能看到周围的一切，知道发生的所有事。我能很快地将别人看不到的事情联系起来。家里有欢笑，也有爱，但也有大量的不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I felt like a real outsider at home and in school, but I was really good at reading people, reading situations. I think my I think a therapist somewhere along the way said, "Yes, that's hypervigilance. You're hypervigilant. You know, I can see everything around me. I know everything's going on. I can connect things very quickly that other people don't see." And there was laughter and there was love. But there was a ton of unpredictability.</p>
</details>

主持人：通常不就是因为年轻时需要保持那种警觉，才导致了过度警觉吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was going to say, isn't that typically what creates hypervigilance is some kind of need to be that aware when you're young?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的。是的。我的意思是，是的，在我的家庭里，爱玩和坚强是非常受重视的。这些是价值观，是父母记分卡上的项目。如果你有趣、随和，能射得准、吐得远、钓得好、开得快，你就能得 A。所以那些事情很受重视，运动能力也很受重视。但那些有趣的事情可能很快变得非常艰难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think yes, being fun-loving was very valued in my family and being tough. These were the values. These are these are on the parental scorecard. This is what got you an A. if you're fun, easy, you can, you know, shoot straight, spit far, fish well, like really drive fast. And so those things were very valued. Athleticism was very valued. Um, but those fun things could turn really hard very quickly.</p>
</details>

是的，我能想象到那个画面，就是……有趣，直到……有趣，直到你的一个家长因为太强硬而被驱逐出赛场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I could just picture it like it's fun until It's fun until you've had a parent ejected from a game for being so hard.</p>
</details>

主持人：那是指你的父亲。

布琳·布朗：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was your father. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：哦，那他真的很强硬，如果他能被驱逐出赛场的话。

布琳·布朗：哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, he was really hard then if he was ejected from a game. Oh yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：我看到一张你和你兄弟姐妹的照片，你紧紧地抱着他们，我想你曾提到，从你眼中能看到某种恐惧。你知道我指的是哪张照片吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a photo I saw of you and your siblings where you're clutching your siblings and I think you referred to it as you could see there was a certain fear in your eyes. Do you know the photo I'm referring to?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我是在一张沙发上吗？一张 70 年代那种黄色丝绒沙发？是的。我想起那张照片。我喜欢那张照片。但作为长女，我确实扮演着保护者的角色。我的代号是“大姐大”（Sister Superior）。虽然是开玩笑的，但也不全是玩笑。比如，如果我父母之间的情况变得紧张，他们会发生激烈的争吵，我就会去把我所有的兄弟姐妹都带到我的房间里。然后我会下楼去处理。我绝对是保护者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Am I on a couch? You're on a couch. Like a yellow velour couch like from the 70s. Yes. Yeah. I think about that picture. I like that picture. But there was definitely I definitely had a protector role as the oldest. I mean code named sister superior. It was jokingly but it wasn't joking. Like if things got hard between my parents and they would get in volatile fights, I would go get all my siblings, put them in my room. I'd go downstairs and handle it, you know? Like I was definitely the protector.</p>
</details>

主持人：是肢体上的激烈争吵吗？

布琳·布朗：偶尔有，但更多是情绪上的激烈。尖叫和叫喊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">physically volatile fights um on occasion but more emotionally volatile. Screaming and shouting. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：我父母也一样。是的，就是很大声。我整个童年，家里的背景音就是尖叫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same with my parents. Yeah. Just loud. There's a background in my whole house for my whole childhood was just screaming.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的，我们家有很多尖叫声。如果你在尖叫声中长大，听着隔墙传来的尖叫声，你懂那种声音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a Yeah, we had a lot of screaming and there's a certain like if you grew up with screaming, hearing screaming through a wall, you know that sound.</p>
</details>

主持人：当然。哦天哪，那是我整个童年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course. Yeah. Oh my god. It was my whole childhood. Yeah.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的。所以，是的，我很抱歉听到你的童年是那样的，我也不喜欢知道我的童年是那样的，但确实有很多尖叫声。所以，我想我是过度警觉、有保护欲、有责任感，同时还带着一种“你最好小心点，因为我会保护我的兄弟姐妹”的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so, yeah, I'm sorry because I don't like to hear that about your childhood and I don't like to know that about my childhood, but there was a lot of screaming. And so, I think hypervigilant, protective, responsible with a dose of be very careful because I will protect my siblings.</p>
</details>

### 爱、婚姻与自我接纳的漫长旅程

主持人：那作为一个年轻人，这对你的爱情观有何影响？我显然对我的情况有同样的感觉。我想我学到的教训是，爱就像一座监狱。因为是我妈妈在喊叫，我爸爸是囚犯，他不会回应。所以你有一个女人对他喊叫六七个小时，而他坐在那里，像个无生命的物体一样看着屏幕。我记得当时想，“哦，好吧。所以如果我长大后谈恋爱，我就会成为一个女人的囚犯。好吧，听起来不吸引人。”如果你换个房间，她会跟着他。所以我像躲瘟疫一样躲避恋爱关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and how did that change your model of love as a young person? It must have been because I mean I obviously feel the same way about about my situation. And um I think the lesson I learned was that love was like a prison cuz it was my mom doing the shouting and my dad was the prisoner and he wouldn't respond. So this you've got a woman shouting at him for six seven hours a day and him sat there like he's a like an inanimate object looking at the screen. And I remember thinking, "Oh, okay. So, if I get in a relationship when I'm older, then I'm going to be a a prisoner to a woman. Okay? Doesn't sound doesn't sound appealing. And if you move to a different room, you'd follow him. So, I avoided relationships like the plague.</p>

布琳·布朗：史蒂夫（Steve）翻过了我的墙。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Steve got over the wall. Damn it.</p>

<p class="english-text">That's your partner, not me. Just for context.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：不，不是你。虽然你现在干得不错。你就像跨过了一条我喜欢的、满是食人鱼的护城河。但吊桥……我看到……我的史蒂夫，他绝对是翻过了墙。但那就像是“英雄识英雄”。他也有堵墙。

<details>

<p class="english-text">No, not Yeah. Not you. Although you're doing a hell of a job right now. Um, you're like you've crossed a piranha filled moat that I like. Um, but the drawbridge is like I'm see I'm just see I'm going to see my Steve my Steve definitely definitely got over the wall. Um, but it was like game game recognizes game. He had a wall.</p>
</details>

主持人：哦，好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, okay.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的。所以我们对各自的墙进行了长时间的交谈。在那些交谈中，那些墙在彼此面前慢慢地倒塌了。我们现在已经在一起 38 年了。哇。是的。这是我一生中做过的最难的事，毫无疑问。伙计，没有比这更难的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh, and so we had long conversations about our walls and and slowly through those conversations. We just those walls crumbled with each other and we've been together now for 38 years. Wow. Yeah. Um, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life bar none, dude. Nothing has been harder.</p>
</details>

我们结婚六个月后，我去看了个治疗师，我说：“我做不到。我必须离开这段婚姻。”我们结婚前断断续续约会了七年。我说：“我得离开。”她说：“这很难。我能看出这行不通。”我当时对史蒂夫产生了一丝维护之情，我说：“你什么意思？”她说：“他喜欢你的程度，远超过你喜欢你自己的程度。这一定很糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when we got married, six months after we got married, this is, you know, you you said for you love was going to be being a prisoner. And having to just shut down to survive. For me, 6 months after we were married, I went to go see a therapist and I said, "I cannot do this. I've got to get out of this marriage." And we had dated off and on for 7 years before we got married. And I said, "I got to get out." And she said, "I could th this is hard. I I could see how this is not working." And I was like, I had a twinge of defensiveness about Steve. And I said, 'What do you mean? And she said, he likes you so much more than you like you. It must be terrible.</p>
</details>

我当时想，去你的，伙计。你被解雇了。我当时想，我太……我想，什么？这是我的一个“信号”。如果我发出一个非常高音的“什么？”，那就意味着我在找我的钱包，我知道门在哪里。我一直在想，你什么意思？她说：“和一个能看到你、真正了解你、并且如此爱你的人在一起，一定非常不舒服，因为你还没有找到一种方式去看到自己、如此爱自己。这一定很令人不安。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's like, you, man. You're fired. I was like, I am so I thought, what? That's what I do. So if you I'm going to give you one of my tells. If I do a really high-pitched what that means I'm that means I'm looking for my purse and I'm get I know where the door is. Um I I I just kept thinking what what do you mean? He said it's got it's got to be very com uncomfortable to be with someone who sees you and really knows you and loves you so much when you have not found a way to see you and love you so much. It's got to be disconcerting.</p>
</details>

真是个混蛋，哇。但那是真的。我必须达到这样一个点，我开始想，也许我应该像他喜欢我一样喜欢我自己，然后再做一个更好的决定，看这段关系是否能行。

</details>

当你在一个只有“愤怒”或“封闭”两种情绪选择的环境中长大……在《Atlas of the Heart》中，我写了 87 种我认为很重要的情绪，因为我们语言的局限就是我们世界的局限。当你的情绪只有两个桶时，所有东西都必须放进这两个桶里。事实上，在我们过去 15 年的研究中，我们发现普通人能准确识别并说出的情绪只有三种：快乐、悲伤、愤怒。

<details>

<p class="english-text">When you grow up and pissed off or shut down are your two emotional opportunities. Like there, you know, in Atlas of the Heart, I write about 87 emotions that I think are important to understand because the limits of our language are the limits of our world. When you have two buckets, then everything must go in those. And in fact, in our research over the last 15 years, we found the average person can accurately identify and name three emotions. Happy, sad, pissed off.</p>
</details>

在我家，悲伤不是一个选项，那是软弱。所以你要么愤怒，要么“还行”。所以当我害怕、感到悲伤、焦虑、失望、痛苦时，我只会表现出愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in my family, sad was not an option. That was weakness. So you could be pissed or okay. So when I get scared, when I feel grief, when I'm anxious, when I feel disappointment, when I feel anguish, I'm just angry.</p>
</details>

主持人：你之前说你在学校或家里都格格不入，我不明白为什么。另外，治疗师说你不如他喜欢你那样喜欢自己，我也不清楚是什么让你不喜欢自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's two sort of outstanding question marks in my head and they might be the same answer, but it's you said earlier on that you didn't fit in at school or at home, and I didn't understand why you didn't fit in at school or at home. And then the other thing that's still a question mark in my head is the therapist said to you that you well asserted that you didn't like yourself as much as he liked you. And I wasn't clear on what made you not like yourself.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我想离开我长大的地方。我想离开我所知道的一切。所以我总感觉自己是个局外人。我不受欢迎，也没和橄榄球队的四分卫约会。那是我父母、他们父母以及他们父母的梦想，你知道，你成为啦啦队长，和四分卫约会，然后得到一个农场。所以我觉得自己不可爱，不受欢迎，不被理解。而在家里，我不安分。我很焦虑，总是戒备着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, cuz my parents parented with a very big heaping dose of shame.</p>

布琳·布朗：是的。而且很多都关乎外表，要有趣。是的，外表。比如，你知道，用热卷发器弄出蓬松的金发。头发越高，离上帝越近。你得坚强、强壮，能戴上棒球帽迅速赶到某个地方，低维护，同时你还得像个选美皇后。

### 权力的运作：恐惧、掌控与政治叙事

主持人：在过去的二十多年里，你认为世界发生了怎样的变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how has your perspective on how has the world changed in those last two decades in your view?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：在任何伟大进步之前，都会有一次倒退。当你观察世界各地的政治政府，看看现在权力是如何被使用的，这会告诉你很多关于他们害怕什么的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unions would say before any great progression there is a regression and I think that when you look at various admin I know you have a very global audience when you look at administrations political administrations across the world and you look at how power is being used right now it will tell you a lot about what they're afraid of.</p>
</details>

主持人：目前似乎能让人们当选的主流政治叙事是，如果你说那些肤色不同的人是你生活中痛苦和苦恼的原因，你就能赢得选举。实际上，是那些比你地位低的人，那些越过边境或乘小船穿越英吉利海峡的人，正在毁掉你的生活。这似乎是在美国和英国赢得权力的一种非常有效的叙事方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The leading political narrative at the moment that seems to be getting people elected is if you say those people with that skin color are the reason for the pain and anguish in your life. It's actually the people below you that are coming over the border or crossing the the English Channel on dingies that are ruining your life. And it seems to be like a really effective narrative to earn power both in the US and the UK.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：老实说，我认为我们再也不会谈论比这更重要的事情了。当你使用权力，特别是“凌驾于他人之上的权力”（power over），因为权力有多种形式。有“与人共有的权力”（power with）、“赋予他人的权力”（power to）和“内在的权力”（power within）。那些使用“内在权力”的人，他们的信念体系完全不同。我们相信权力是无限的，可以通过分享而增长。而那些使用“凌驾于他人之上的权力”的人，他们的信念体系是权力是有限的，就像披萨一样，如果我分给你一点，我就会有损失。所以权力必须被囤积、保护，而不能分享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think we'll ever talk about anything more important than this to be honest with you. when when you use power especially power over because there's multiple kinds of power. There's power with into and power within. So people that use power within to and power within work from a belief system that's completely different. We believe that power is infinite and can grow when shared. People who use power over work from a a belief system that power is finite like pizza and if I give you any I have a a deficit. So it's got to be hoarded and protected and not shared.</p>
</details>

理解“凌驾于他人之上的权力”非常重要，因为当人们使用这种权力时，他们肯定是在让你知道他们害怕什么，因为那正是他们关注和利用的。我认为这绝对是真的：如果你给人们一个可以厌恶和归咎于他们痛苦的对象，而且这些人看起来与投票的人不同，那么你百分之百会赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Power over is really important to understand because when people are using power over, they're definitely letting you know what they're afraid of because that's what they're focused on and they're tapping into. And I think this is absolutely true. If you give people someone to dislike and blame for their pain and they look different than the people who are voting, you will win a 100 times out of 100.</p>
</details>

如果你说：“我看到了你的痛苦。我可以告诉你痛苦的确切来源，并且我可以为你解决这个问题。”而痛苦的来源将是显而易见的。你不会在他们身上看到自己。

所以，你谈论的那种叙事是一个完整的循环。当权者利用权力来解决他们害怕的问题。他们通过利用恐惧和给人们制造一个敌人来获得权力。这就是它的运作方式。我在组织中花了 95% 的时间与高管和高级领导者合作。这就是它在组织中的运作方式，在政治中、在信仰社区中的运作方式。这就是权力通常的运作方式。

This this is how it works in organizations. how it works in political, you know, how it works in faith communities. This is how power works in general.</p>

“凌驾于他人之上的权力”是一种非常特殊的权力。它尤其危险，因为为了维持它，你必须周期性地对弱势群体施加残忍行为。你必须提醒人们你的能力。

### 系统理论：为何我们需要保持“边界渗透性”

布琳·布朗：我是一个**系统理论**（Systems Theory: 一种跨学科的研究方法，它将世界视为一个由相互关联和相互依赖的部分组成的复杂系统）的信奉者。我认为，如果你不理解系统理论，至少在现在领导一个组织时，你会落后。因为组织内外的复杂性如此之大，我们需要一个框架来理解所有这些独立的系统是如何相互碰撞的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a big systems theory. I'm a systems theory person. I think in systems theory I was trained in systems theory. I think if you don't understand system systems theory, at least if you're leading an organization right now, you're going to fall behind because the complexity inside and outside of organizations is such that we need a framework to understand how all of these individual systems are bumping up against each other.</p>
</details>

为了让系统茁壮成长，它们必须保持可渗透的边界。这意味着它们必须允许来自其他系统的反馈流入和流出，以保持觉知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in order for systems to thrive and grow, they have to keep permeable boundaries. Meaning they have to allow feedback to flow in and out from other systems to be aware.</p>
</details>

当世界变得复杂时，会发生什么呢？我们开始不想要反馈。复杂性太大了。所以我们开始关闭那些可渗透的边界。那么，当一个系统的边界不再可渗透时，会发生什么呢？它会萎缩。在萎缩的过程中，系统会变得自我参照。“我们好吗？我们很棒。”“我们对吗？我们是对的。”“我们走在正轨上吗？我们走在正轨上。”因为系统的边界不再渴望外部反馈，即使反馈是艰难的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happens when the world gets complex is we start not wanting the feedback. The complexity is too big. So we start shutting down those permeable boundaries. Well, what happens to a system where the boundaries are no longer permeable. It atrophies. And in the in the process of atrophying, the system becomes self-referencing. Are we good? We're great. Are we right? We're right. Are we on target? We're on target. because the boundaries of the system is are no longer craving outside feedback even when it's tough.</p>
</details>

在今天的商业环境中，地缘政治现实、市场变化、人工智能……我的意思是，这太疯狂了。因此，我们关闭不确定性和复杂性的倾向，是我们工作和生活所在系统面临的最大威胁。那种自我保护、关闭城墙、升起吊桥、用食人鱼填满护城河的做法，我们根本没有这种奢侈。我们必须保持边界的可渗透性。我们必须不断学习、猜测、忘却、再学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in businesses today, the geopolitical realities, the market changes, AI, I mean, it's crazy. And so our predisposition to shut down uncertainty and complexity is the biggest threat to the systems in which we work and live. the self-protect, close the wall, put up the drawbridge, fill the moat with piranhas. We just don't have that luxury. We've got to keep the the boundaries permeable. We've got to keep learning, guessing, unlearning, relearning.</p>
</details>

主持人：另一个增加的复杂性是算法的兴起。当我想到由人工智能驱动的算法时，它们会更擅长知道你想看什么，以便你花更多时间，消费更多广告。这意味着，最好的做法可能是给我看一些非常可怕的东西，或者确认我已有的信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the added complexities is the rise in algorithms. And and actually when I think about algorithms that are powered by AI, they're going to be even better at knowing what you want to see so that you spend time, so that you consume more adverts, which means probably the best thing to show me is either something really fearful or to to confirm what I already believe.</p>

布琳·布朗：百分之百是这样。

<p class="english-text">An algorithm that was doing the opposite probably wouldn't be an enjoyable experience for the average human brain. It would cause too much dissonance, too much discomfort,</p>

主持人：是的，非常好。但对经营企业和销售广告来说却很糟糕。所以任何采取这种方法的公司都会破产。这就是为什么我认为 TikTok 如此成功，因为它的算法……我不用 TikTok，但我听说它令人难以置信地上瘾。

But um from what I hear is it's so unbelievably addictive.</p>
</details>

### 精神危机与真正的“连接”

布琳·布朗：是的，你刚才已经说清楚了。我们情绪失调，我们互不信任，我们对自己也不太信任，而且我们是脱节的。但我不能放弃人类，我的天性不是那样的。我只是相信，我们本性中的善多于贪婪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, you just laid it out. You just laid it out. We're emotionally disregulated. We're distrustful of each other. We don't trust ourselves very much. And we're disconnected. I can't give up on people, though. I'm not built that way. Like, I just believe that we are more good than greedy.</p>
</details>

你知道，我曾与特雷弗·诺亚（Trevor Noah）在一个活动上对话，我提到了一个让我非常兴奋的术语，他对此提出了挑战。我说，我认为我们需要的是“认知主权”（cognitive sovereignty）。我们需要从算法手中夺回控制权，决定我们消费什么、阅读什么、如何思考、进行批判性思考。我们需要将我们的注意力和专注力视为商品，因为有人在追逐它们，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I I was in conversation with Trevor Noah at an event and I mentioned this term that I I was really excited about and he challenged me on it and I said, I think what we need is cognitive sovereignty. We need to wrestle control away from the algorithms and decide what we consume, what we read, how we think, think critically. We need to think about our attention and our focus as commodities that people are after because they're after them, right?</p>
</details>

但他有一个有趣的观点。他总是能提出有趣的观点，你不觉得吗？他总是能提出有趣的观点。该死。而且他很风趣。但他说：“不，布琳，我们需要更少的认知主权。”我问：“你什么意思？”他说：“一切都关乎‘为你推荐’页面。一切都是为你。我们需要的是‘社群主权’（communal sovereignty）。”他说：“你知道，整个问题就在于你的‘为你推荐’页面是完全主权的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He had an interesting point though. He always has interesting points, don't you think? He's always got an interesting point. Damn it. Um and he's funny, but he said, "No, we need less cognitive sovereignty, Brené." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "Everything's about the for you page. Everything's for you. We need communal sovereignty. He's like, you know, the whole problem is that your for you page is completely sovereign.</p>
</details>

我听到一些让我恐慌的事情，因为它们是如此的不一致。我听到有人说：“嘿，科技亿万富翁，我的孩子应该学什么？我为我的孩子担心。”“哦，他们应该学习编程、物理。”然后五分钟后，就好像那个回答没发生过一样，有人会问：“你把你的成功归功于什么？当你深入思考时。”同一个人会说：“我深入阅读哲学和斯多葛学派的作品。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hear them talking and I hear things that are so misaligned that it panics me. So I hear someone say, "Hey, you know, tech billionaire, what what should my kids study? I'm worried for my kids." well they should study coding physics you know and then five minutes later as if that answer didn't happen someone will say to what do you attribute your success I mean deeply when you think about it and the same person will say my deep reading of philosophy in the stoics</p>
</details>

然后我就在想，到底是哪个，伙计？然后我开始推断，想知道是否正在出现一个“思考阶层”，他们会说：“我们要读哲学，我们要读文科，我们要研究历史，而你们其他人就继续刷手机吧。别担心那些大词，我们会为你们处理所有的大词。”就像他们问史蒂夫·乔布斯：“天哪，你的孩子们一定很喜欢 iPad 吧。”史蒂夫·乔布斯说：“我的孩子们没有 iPad。”然后他的传记作者，曾与他的家人共度时光，说他不是在开玩笑。晚餐时没有科技产品。他们在谈论艺术和历史。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and so then I'm thinking to myself well which is it dude and then I then I start to extrapolate from there and wonder if there is a thinking class that's emerging where they're like, "We're going to to read philosophy and we're going to read the liberal arts and we're going to study history and the rest of you just keep scrolling. Don't worry about the big words. We'll we'll handle all the big words for you." Like, it's like when they asked Steve Jobs, "Boy, your kids must love the iPad." Steve Jobs said, "My kids don't have an iPad." And then his biographer who spent time with his family said he wasn't kidding. There's no technology at dinner. They're talking about art and history.</p>
</details>

主持人：“连接”这个词是什么意思？它意味着个人层面上的，意味着我有朋友和亲密关系吗？那是我应该寻找的连接类型吗？还是我需要更进一步，与我的城市、我的城镇、我的世界、社区，与某种更宏大的东西，比如上帝，建立连接？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This word connection, what does that mean? Does it mean on an individual basis? Does it mean me having friends and relationships? Is that connection? Is that the type of connection I should be looking for? Or does it need do I need to like do you think people need to ladder up further to their city, their town, their world, to the community, to something bigger, God? What what does connection mean in this context?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的。我认为这个问题的答案是“是的”。我们的神经生物学结构决定了我们要与他人建立连接。在没有连接的情况下，总会有痛苦。总是会有痛苦。对我来说，连接是在一种关系中，我们既能给予也能接受，我们感到被看见、被听到、被相信、被重视的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. I think the answer to that question is yes. We're neuro neurobiologically hardwired to be in connection with other people and in the absence of connection there's always suffering always suffering in the absence of connection. To me, connection is the ability to be in a relationship where we can both give and receive, where we feel seen, heard, believed, valued.</p>
</details>

那种人与人之间的连接在微观层面，一对一地与他人交往，非常重要。我认为归属感和地方感也很重要。我不知道这是否必须是一个地理位置，但成为比自己更宏大的事物的一部分的感觉，我认为也很重要。所以，爱与归属感、连接，是不可或缺的需求。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That is that human connection is really important on a micro level, one-on-one with other human beings. I think a sense of belonging and a sense of place.

So love and belonging, connection, irreducible needs.</p>
</details>

我将灵性定义为通过某种比我们更宏大的事物与他人密不可分地连接在一起。也许是爱，也许是上帝，也许是钓鱼。对不同的人来说是不同的。对我来说，信仰是我的价值观之一，我是一个相当虔诚的信徒。

<details>

Um I'm a pretty deep person of faith.</p>
</details>

### 真正的归属感始于独自站立

主持人：在你的书《Braving the Wilderness》中，副标题是“寻求真正的归属感与独自站立的勇气”。这似乎是一个二分法或矛盾。既要归属，又要独自站立。为什么这两者都重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you talk about belonging, it's interesting in your book Braving the Wilderness, which I think the question is kind of summed up by the subtitle here. The quest for true belonging and the courage to stand alone. This appears to be a dichotomy or a contradiction. To belong, but also to stand alone. Why are both of these important?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：因为我认为，如果你不首先归属于自己，你就无法真正归属于任何事物或任何群体。真正的归属感要求我们做自己，而不是改变自己。那是“融入”（fitting in）。“融入”是归属感最大的威胁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because I don't think you can truly belong to anything or any or or any group if you don't belong to yourself first. True belonging requires us to be who we are, not to change who we are. That's fitting in. Fitting in is the greatest threat to belonging.</p>
</details>

主持人：这让我们都回到了我们的童年，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which takes us both back to our childhoods, right?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：是的。融入，融入，融入。问题在于，那种变色龙般的技能意味着，为了融入，你首先背叛的是你自己。我们必须能够独自站立。这就是现在世界上正在发生的事情。我们正在大规模地分化成意识形态的堡垒，我们会到达一个地步，我甚至不认识你，但我会称你为朋友，因为我们讨厌同样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Fit in. Fit in. Fit in. fit in. The problem is that that chameleon kind of skill set means that in order to fit in, the first person you betray is yourself. We've got to be able to stand alone. And that's what's happening right now in the world. I mean, if I if I look back at Braving the Wilderness, that was maybe the only prophetic book that I think I've ever written. like that like like that. I don't think I'm prophetlike, but man, did I call what was happening in terms of the big sort into ideological bunkers where we're going to get to a place where I don't even know you, but I'm going to call you friend because we hate the same people.</p>
</details>

那些意识形态的堡垒是如此危险。假设我们对移民问题有相同的看法。我们会躲在桌子后面，在我们的意识形态堡垒里说：“是的，我们是对的，那些家伙都疯了。”然后有一天，我会转向你，说：“你知道，我在想一件事，我们该如何解决那些从法国乘小船过来的人的问题？因为我认为我们必须解决它，因为我们确实有就业问题和住房危机。”然后你说：“你出局了。”我对你的关心，我与你的连接，完全取决于你是否质疑我们在这里达成一致的任何事情。那是虚假的连接。

And then one day I'm going to turn to you and say, you know, one thing I'm wondering about is how are we going to solve the problem with the folks coming over in the dingies from France? Cuz I don't think we're going to be able to go without solving it because we do have an employment issue and a housing crisis. And then you go, you're out. My my care for you, my connection with you completely dependent on you not questioning anything we agreed to to back here. Well, that's counterfeit connection.</p>

### 脆弱性不是弱点，而是勇气的核心

主持人：脆弱性重要吗？因为现在有很多表演性的脆弱性。成为一个脆弱的人对我的健康、幸福和未来重要吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is vulnerability important? Cuz there's a lot of performative vulnerability taking place in Is it an important thing for my health, happiness, my future to be a vulnerable person?</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：让我们先定义它。脆弱性是我们在面对不确定性、风险和情感暴露时所体验到的情绪。所以，脆弱性是我在不确定、有风险或情感暴露时所感受到的那种畏缩、尴尬的情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's define it. Um vulnerability is the emotion we experience when we have when we are up against uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. So vulnerability is what I feel. It's the cringe, the awkward, the thing that I the emotion I feel in times of uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure.</p>
</details>

我曾去布拉格堡与特种部队合作，我问士兵们一个问题：给我一个你生命中勇气的例子，一个你亲眼目睹或亲身经历的例子，这个例子中不涉及不确定性、风险或情感暴露。没有人能回答。最后，一个年轻的士兵站起来说：“三次任务。没有脆弱性就没有勇气。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">it took a trip to Fort Bragg working with special forces to ask soldiers a question. Give me a single example of courage in your life. One example that you've witnessed or you you yourself have done. One example of courage that did not require uncertainty, risk or emotional exposure. No one could answer it. Finally a young soldier stood up and said three tours. There is no courage without vulnerability.</p>
</details>

所以，脆弱性重要吗？如果我们想在生活中勇敢前行，它就重要。如果我们想以一种与价值观一致且勇敢的方式管理自己，我们必须能够调和我们在不确定、有风险或暴露时的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So is vulnerability important? It is if we want to be brave with our lives. If we if we want to be able to manage ourselves in a way that's values aligned and courageous, we have to be able to reconcile how we feel when we're uncertain, at risk, or exposed.</p>
</details>

如果你在生活和工作中做的事情没有风险、没有不确定性、没有情感暴露，那么它们就不是勇敢的。如果你知道结果会怎样，那不是勇气。勇气是当你无法预测结果时，仍愿意全身心投入。勇气是先说“我爱你”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, if you're doing things in your life, in your work, and there's no risk, no uncertainty, and no exposure, then they're not brave. If you know how it's going to end, that is not courage. Courage is a willingness to show up and be all-in when you cannot predict the outcome. Courage is saying, "I love you first."</p>
</details>

最脆弱的人类情感是喜悦。喜悦是如此脆弱，以至于我们中的一些人在接近它时，会预演悲剧，为失望做准备。它如此脆弱，以至于我们甚至不让自己感受喜悦，因为我们太害怕有人会把它夺走，我们会被失望重击。

<details>

### 信任的建立：“弹珠罐”理论

主持人：人们总是问我，是信任先于脆弱性，还是脆弱性先于信任？我是先信任你，然后变得脆弱，还是先变得脆弱，然后信任你？我认为这是一个非常缓慢的叠加过程。我们互相了解，我分享一点点。我不会一见面就说：“你好，斯蒂芬。这是我最黑暗、最可怕、最痛苦的创伤。”因为那种试探实际上是一种盔甲。

<details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I've heard about your marble jar theory. So, I got a jar of marbles.</p>
</details>

布琳·布朗：我看到了。这个故事源于我女儿艾伦上四年级时。她从学校回家，关上前门，然后顺着门滑坐到地上，一堆地哭泣。她说，发生了一件很糟糕的事。她在休息时非常私密地与一两个朋友分享了这件事。当她回到教室时，她们已经告诉了班上所有的同学，每个人都在嘲笑她、指指点点。她说：“我再也不会相信任何人了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I saw that. Um, so this comes you know where where is where where do I get my information? Ellen's in fourth grade, my oldest. She comes home from school. The front door closes. She slides down the door into a heap, sobbing. She says that something hard happened. She shared it like very confidentially with one or two of her friends during recess. When she got back to the classroom, they had told everybody in her class, all 30 kids, everybody was laughing and pointing and making fun of her. And she said, "I will never trust anyone again."</p>
</details>

我立刻想到的反应是：“说得对，一个都别信。你只要相信你妈妈就行了。”但那不是正确的做法，对吧？你希望孩子能与他人建立信任。所以我说：“信任真的很难。”她说：“我不懂。”当时她的老师博克姆夫人有一个弹珠罐。当全班集体做出好的决定时，她会往空罐子里放弹珠，装满后他们就能多一次课间休息和派对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And my response immediately to my in my mind was, "Damn straight, not a person. You trust your mama." And that's it. Like that was my response. But again, that's not the right thing to do, right? You want a kid who can develop trust with others. So I said, "Trust is really hard." She said, "I don't understand it." And her teacher at the time, Mrs. Bockam, had a mar a marble jar. And when the team when the when the class would collectively make good decisions, she would put marbles in this empty jar, and when it got full, they'd have an extra recess and party.</p>
</details>

我立刻想到，因为我正在向一个四年级学生解释信任这个复杂的概念，我说：“信任就是那个弹珠罐。”她说：“你什么意思？”我说：“每次你和别人分享机密的事情，而他们没有泄露，他们就得到一颗弹珠。每次你建立信任，当你想分享非常私密和个人的事情时，你就找一个弹珠罐装满弹珠的朋友。你有任何弹珠罐朋友吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so immediately what came to me, because I'm describing trust, which is a hard concept to a fourth grader. I said, "Trust is the marble jar." She's like, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Every time you share somebody something with someone that's confidential and they don't share it, they get a marble. Every time you build trust, when you want to share something really private and personal, you look for a friend whose jar is full of marbles. Do you have any marble jar friends?"</p>
</details>

她描述了这些弹珠是如何通过非常微小的事情获得的。她记得我祖父母的名字。她给我留了个座位。我缺课时她关心我。这让我开始思考关于信任的文献。我立刻去查阅了戈特曼夫妇的研究。戈特曼夫妇说，信任是在日常的点滴小事中赢得的。

<p class="english-text">And what was shocking to me is that Ellen was conveying that these marbles were being earned on these very small. She knew my grandparents' name. She gave me a seat to sit at.

I mean, just like Yeah. So I go to the Gottman's research on trust. And I read right off the bat where Gottman say trust is earned in small moments every day.</p>

他讲了一个故事，是他最喜欢的故事。他正在读一本悬疑小说的倒数第二页，他想：“天哪，天哪，凶手是谁？”他跳起来去刷牙，走到浴室，看到他的妻子在哭着梳头。他想：“该死，别看。一切都好。就去浴室，然后回到你的书里去。”他说：“那是一个‘推拉门’时刻。”

<p class="english-text">He tells a story. It's my favorite story that he tells. He's on the second to last page of his mystery. He's like, "Oh my god, oh my god." Like, who did it?

Just go to the bathroom and get back in your get back to your book." And he's like, "That's a sliding door moment.</p>
</details>

在那一刻我有一个选择：建立信任，停下来说‘怎么了？’；或者建立背叛，假装没看见她在伤心。所以我停下来，从她手中接过梳子，开始帮她梳头，然后问：‘怎么了？’

</details>

那就是我们时常会遇到的“推拉门”时刻，对吧？所以对我来说，信任是随着时间的推移，一颗一颗弹珠慢慢建立起来的。这就是我们教给《财富》100 强公司最高层领导者的方式——信任就是一个弹珠罐。它是挣来的。

每个人都会害怕。害怕是正常的。危险的是我们在害怕时为自我保护而伸向的盔甲。以及那副盔甲如何使我们远离爱、连接和我们的价值观。所以我认为，最艰难的工作是不断地意识到：我的盔甲是什么？当害怕时，我在抓取什么？当我想保护我的自我价值感、我的自尊时，我在抓取什么？以及那东西有多沉重。

<p class="english-text">Everybody's afraid. It's okay to be afraid. What's dangerous is the armor that we reach for to self-protect when we're afraid. And how that armor moves us away from love, connection, and our values. And so I think the hardest work is for me constantly being aware of what is my armor? What am I what am I grabbing for when I'm afraid? What am I grabbing for when I want to protect my sense of self-worth, my ego? Like, and and how heavy that is.</p>

在某个时刻，我必须穿上它，因为那是我成长过程中的生存之道。但这是中年时期一个重要的发展里程碑，这时宇宙会抓住你的肩膀，把你拉得很近，然后说：“我不再开玩笑了。他们给了你天赋。选择不让它们成长不是无害的。”

<p class="english-text">You know, at some point I had to wear it because that was survival for me growing up. But this is the big this is the big developmental milestone of middle age which you are squarely entering which is kind of when the universe grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you really close and says I'm not around anymore. They gave you gifts. Choosing not to grow into them is not benign.</p>

那是有后果的，而你的盔甲正在碍事。你现在是个成年人了。你有不同的选择。放开那些不再为你服务的东西。这就是我认为我们在中年时期必须努力解决的重大里程碑：什么东西不再服务于我们，并阻止我们成长为我们想成为的人。

<p class="english-text">There's a consequence for that and your armor is getting in the way. You're a grown ass person now. You have different choices. Let go of what doesn't serve. And that is the big milestone I think that we have to wrestle with in midlife. What no longer serves that's preventing us from growing into who we want to be.</p>

我很感激我拥有的新技能，这些技能让我更接近我想成为的那个人、那个母亲、那个伴侣、那个领导者。但我时刻提醒自己，当我害怕时，我会变得很可怕；我很容易把事情灾难化，这对周围的每个人都很痛苦；我不需要被喜欢，我只需要做我自己。

布琳·布朗：是的。我的意思是，我不会……我有非常严格的界限。我是一个界限感很强的人。但当我看到某人以某种方式行事时，我会想：“我的内心看到了你内心的挣扎。我懂。我明白你在做什么。我不会容忍它。我会为此设定一个界限，但我不会真的因此评判你。只是那种行为在这里是不可以的。”
