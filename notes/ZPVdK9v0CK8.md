title: 沟通大师的五大秘诀：掌控对话，应对煤气灯操纵与自恋者
---
### 沟通大师的五大要素

要成为一名卓越的沟通者，从而在生活中实现目标，有五件最重要的事情。首先是**真诚**（Authenticity），而**临在感**（Presence: 全神贯注于当下，不被他物干扰的状态）是真诚的最高体现。其次，要**减少分心**。第三，**停止过度解释**。第四，要**懂得如何处理他人的悲伤**。第五，你必须知道如何**应对自恋者**（Narcissist: 一种以自我为中心，缺乏同理心，需要他人持续关注和赞美的行为模式）和**煤气灯操纵者**（Gaslighter: 通过心理操纵使受害者怀疑自己的记忆、感知或理智的行为）。**杰斐逊·费舍尔**（Jefferson Fisher: 诉讼律师、沟通专家、作家）作为一名获得委员会认证的诉讼律师，正运用他在冲突解决和沟通方面的专业知识，教导夫妻、朋友、员工以及介于这些关系之间的所有人，如何掌握艰难的对话。

What are the five most important things for anyone who's striving to be a masterful communicator to get what they want out of life? The first is authenticity and presence is the highest form of authenticity. Okay, on that point, I'm going to play this video on the screen that went viral of Miley Cyrus and Amy Campbell. Oh, I haven't seen this. That's painful to watch. Number two, reduce the amount of distraction. Three, stop overexplaining. Number four, know how to deal with their sadness. And I'll go through all of these in detail, but number five is you have to know how to handle the narcissist and the gaslighter. What do I do? Let me show you. First, you need to come. Yeah. For a lot of people, that kind of blows their mind. Jefferson Fiser is back and the board certified trial lawyer is using his expertise in conflict resolution and communication to teach couples, friends, employees, and everyone in between how to master difficult conversations.

### 投资沟通，解决冲突

事实是，你必须**投资于你的沟通能力**。如果在工作中我没有说出该说的话，我可能会失去那次晋升机会。在人际关系中也是如此。大多数关系破裂并非因为不再相爱，而是因为在一百个本可以修复的时刻没有进行沟通。你可能会觉得“这太蠢了，这太小事了”，但这些小事累积起来就会出问题。最近一项研究表明，预测孩子在父母关系中幸福感的最大因素，并非父母是否结婚或离婚，而是他们如何处理冲突。人们之所以害怕冲突，是因为不知道该说什么。我希望帮助他们在这种情况下感到**可控和自信**。这包括明白“**争对错是过誉的**”。如果我一开始就带着沮丧回应，我每次都会输。如果你想知道如何应对侮辱、傲慢和轻蔑，首先要做的就是我多次犯过的错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Here's the truth. You have to invest in your communication. If I don't say what needs to be said at work, I'll lose that promotion. Same thing in relationships. Most relationships don't fall apart because they fell out of love. They fell out of communication because of a 100 moments where repair could have happened and it didn't. Cuz you said, "Ah, this is so stupid. This so small." Like there's a recent study showing that the biggest predictor of the child's well-being within the parental relationship is not whether they were married or divorced. It was how they deal with conflict. But people are definitely afraid of the conflict that they're in cuz they don't know what to say. And so I want to help them feel controlled in this, feel confident in this. And it's knowing things like being right is overrated. If I respond first with frustration, I'm going to lose every time. Or if you want to know how to handle the insults, the patronizing, the dismissive, the first thing you have to do is the mistake I've made multiple times.

### 诉讼律师的沟通智慧

**杰斐逊·费舍尔**作为一名诉讼律师，他的职业是帮助客户解决法律需求，尤其在人身伤害领域获得委员会认证。这意味着他会亲自上法庭，面对法官、陪审团、法庭记录员、法警和对方律师，为客户的事实辩护，以争取他们想要的结果。他之所以写这本书，是因为在为客户准备交叉询问和证词时，他发现他们真的不知道如何应对冲突。法律界是冲突最根深蒂固的行业之一，也许除了拳击手或综合格斗选手，很少有其他职业能像诉讼律师一样，真正面对冲突并倾听一切。他的工作是根据客户的事实进行辩护，以达到他们想要的结果。这本书的灵感来源于他教导客户的许多经验，因为他意识到客户对冲突感到极度恐惧。对他们来说，这通常是他们一生中最情绪化、压力最大、最不知所措的时刻，他们身处一个从未去过的地方，只在电视上见过。所以，他的职责就是引导他们，告诉他们“我们该怎么做”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Jefferson Fisher. What do you do professionally? What is your How do you sort of characterize your profession? Well, I'm a trial attorney by trade. What does that mean? That means I help clients with legal needs. I'm board certified in personal injury. So, when people get hurt, I have trials. So, that means there are other attorneys that don't ever go to a courtroom. I go into a courtroom. Then you stand before a judge and a Yeah. You have a judge, you have a jury, you have a court reporter, a baiff, you have opposing attorneys. There are people in the room and you try and convince those people of your point of view to get a particular outcome. I advocate my client's facts in order to get the result that they want. So, why did you think it was important to write a book about conversation talking, getting what you want from the conversations we have with people we care about? Because I have seen time and time again that when I am training a client is what I call I'm preparing them for cross- examination for deposition they really don't know how to engage in conflict. And so I can't think of any other profession that is more entrenched in conflict maybe outside of a a boxer or some you know UFC something that deals with actual conflict and sits there and listens to it all than in the legal world in a trial attorney. And so, yeah, it's my job to advocate based on my clients facts to to get them the result that they want. The reason why I wrote that book and how that book applies is I took a lot of the lessons that I teach every one of my clients and put them in that book because I'm sitting there preparing them for cross-examination and realizing, oh, wait, they are deathly afraid of the conflict that they're in. is most of the time it's the most emotional, stressful, overwhelmed they are ever in their life. They've they're in a place they've never been. They don't know what it's like. They've only seen it on TV. And so it's my job to kind of take their hand and say, "This is how we're going to this is how we're going to do it."

### 沟通的真正目标：掌控与自信

人们普遍认为，任何争论或对话的目标都是“赢”，就像打官司一样。但**杰斐逊·费舍尔**多次发现，即使客户赢得了官司，他们的问题依然存在，他们真正想要的只是一个道歉。如果有人能说一句“对不起”，可能根本就不会有官司。因此，他现在的工作和热情是帮助普通人进入冲突，并让他们感到“**我能掌控，我充满自信，我知道自己要去哪里**”。因为他以前经历过，所以他知道这并非与生俱来的技能，而是需要学习的。如果你能掌握这种技能，应对冲突、难缠的人、**煤气灯操纵者**和**自恋者**，你的生活会在很多方面变得不同。首先，你将具备在生活中任何领域取得成功所需的专业知识。人们认为沟通是零成本的，但实际上它会让你付出代价。如果你在关系中不发声，会损害你的自我价值感。如果你在工作中没有说出该说的话，你可能会失去晋升机会。每一次你没有说出该说的话，就像一张账单，它会告诉你因为没有在正确的时间说出或没有说出某些话，你错失了什么。当你意识到，如果你能自信地说话，你就会获得更多；如果你能有控制地表达，你也会获得更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And how does that apply to the average person in their life? People think that the goal of any argument or any conversation is to win. And same for a trial. They say you want to win a trial. I've seen it so many times where I've gotten the result that they want and I've realized they still have the problem. They still wanted the apology. It all would have been resolved. There'd be no case if somebody had just said, "I'm sorry." And so you find that for the everyday person, it's my job now and and passion to be able to help them get into conflict and say, "I feel controlled in this. I feel confident in this now. I know exactly where I'm going in this because I've been there before and it is not a skill that comes naturally. It is a skill that is learned. And what do you think is the the sort of variance and outcome? How would my life change if I became an absolute master in this? You know, if I started from zero in this regard and then I became a master in dealing with conflict and dealing with difficult people and dealing with people that gaslight me and dealing with narcissists and all these kinds of things, why would my life be different and and in what domains? It's quite a lot. Yeah. First would be you would be equipped for outside of necessary expertise anywhere you wanted to be in life. People feel like communication is zero cost. It costs you something. If I'm not speaking up in that relationship, it costs my own sense of worth. If I don't say what needs to be said at work, I might have lost that promotion. I I everything the bill always comes due. If you can think of every time you didn't say the thing as like a receipt at a restaurant, every time it's it's a bill of what I am not putting into my life because I chose to either say something or not say something at the right time. And when you realize that if I can speak with confidence, well, that's me gaining a little bit more. If if I can say things with control, that's me gaining just a little bit more.

</details>

### 掌控自我，而非争辩对错

第二个好处是，你会意识到**争对错是过誉的**。即使有人告诉你天空是紫色的，你也不必为此烦恼。这与你的身份或观点无关。我们都是制造观点的机器，尤其在社交媒体上，人们总是对那些与自己关系不大的事情发表意见。如果你能拥有这份内心的平静，知道“**我不需要认同你才能理解你**”，那么即使你有自己的观点，我也不必回以我的观点。如果你说了什么，我可以选择什么都不说。对很多人来说，这简直是颠覆性的：“你是指我不必回应吗？”是的，你不必说任何话。如果有人语速很快，你可以语速很慢。他们忘记了你拥有完全的自主权。当你意识到是你自己在掌控方向盘时，你就能掌控自己的人生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

A second benefit of it is that you realize being right is overrated. You can, if you tell me the sky is purple, knock yourself out, Stephen. It doesn't have to touch anything with me on on who I am or any of my opinions. We're we're opinion-making machines. I feel that's all on social media. It's to be set up to give your opinion on things that most of the time will rarely ever touch you. And if you can have the peace of mind of knowing I don't need to agree with you to understand you. If you have an opinion, I don't have to give one back. If you say something, I can choose not to say anything at all. And for a lot of people, that kind of blows their mind of, "You mean I don't have to respond?" No, you don't have to say anything. If somebody's talking really fast, you can talk really slow. They forget that you have full autonomy in it. And when you realize that it's you who's taking the wheel, you take the wheel of your life.

### 公平与正义：如何选择放下

主持人**史蒂芬**（Stephen）问及**杰斐逊**关于“正义”的看法，比如当一个人被他人冤枉时，是否需要纠正记录，因为我们内心深处都有对公平和正义的渴望。**杰斐逊**回应道，正义确实是一种高优先级的内在价值。但问题是，你愿意背负这种感受多久？你可以选择放下，也可以选择说出该说的话。他的立场绝不是让你谨小慎微，不敢发声，而是恰恰相反。他主张你以一种**可控的方式**说出你需要说的话，这表明你这样做是因为“**有必要说，而不是因为我必须说**”。很多人觉得“有些话必须说”，但也许你不是那个说的人，也许现在不是说的时机，因为如果对方不愿意听，那说出来又有什么用呢？他喜欢说：“要学会为自己挺身而出，你首先要学会谁值得你为此起身。”他不会为不值得他时间的事情大费周章。所以，正义当然值得追求。但当你选择背负它时，很多时候，别人对你做的事情对他们来说无关紧要，但对你来说却是一切。你可能会因此背负一个评论二十年，而你本可以在很久以前就选择放下，但你却选择了背负，现在只有你一个人承受着这份重担。

<summary>Original English</summary>

But what about justice, Jefferson? Yeah. Do you know justice? Like this person has wronged me. They've said something wrong. They've I don't know, they tweeted at me something which is incorrect. I need to correct the record. Justice. I think we all have a sort of an an innate sense of justice. We want things to be fair and right. Yes, justice is an inherent value that is high priority for a lot of people for good reason. You might say, well, they've they've wronged me. This isn't right. That's all well and good. The question is going to be, how long do you want to carry it? How long do you want to carry that feeling? Because I can either choose to let it go. I can choose to say the thing. It's it's not at all my position that you should be stepping on eggshells and not say the thing and be a wallflower. No, it's the opposite. I'm saying you you say what you need to say in a way that is controlled, in a way that is signaling I don't I'm saying this because it needs to be said, but not because I have to say it. There's a lot of people who feel like, well, something needs to be said, but am I maybe you're not the one to say it. Maybe you you're the one that needs to maybe needs doesn't need to be said right now because if they're not willing to listen, well then what good is it ever do? What I like to say is, you know, for you to learn how to stand up for yourself, you first have to learn who's worth getting out of your chair for. I'm not going to be making big moves for something that is not at all worth my my time. So yeah, justice is absolutely worth it. But when you go, I'm the one that has to be carrying this. A lot of the times people do things to you and it's nothing to them, but yet it's everything to you and now you're just you're walking around for 20 years with a comment that you could have said something way long ago and decided to drop it, but you you chose to to carry it and now you're the only one that has the the weight of that.

### 情绪管理与沟通的锚点

如果你正在与一个有权力的人打交道，比如公司的上级，或者社交圈中地位较高的人，而他们不断地贬低你，或者制造麻烦，甚至是你的伴侣，那么一个**沟通能力强的人**有什么特点呢？当你说话时，感觉非常**镇定和可控**。为了达到这种效果，你需要刻意放慢语速，降低音量。为什么？因为你想把对方拉到你的频率上来。如果你能做到这一点，那么即使谈论更困难的事情，也不会感到仓促。当你能向他们展示**改变不会困扰你**，你不需要仓促应对局面时，人们会感到你给予了他们一种**舒适感**。换句话说，在对话中，每个人都在寻找一个**锚点**（Anchor: 在沟通中提供稳定感和方向的人）。在会议中，我们倾向于倾听那些作为锚点的人。他们通常话不多，更倾向于观察和倾听，而不是总是对别人指手画脚。如果你听到有人说“你知道我认为你应该怎么做吗？”这会让你想听从他们的建议吗？不会。因为他们把这变成了自己的想法，然后告诉你该怎么做。如果你对我说“你不能那样做”，你首先会想到什么？“我能！”这与成为对话中的锚点是同一个概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

If I'm dealing with someone who's in a position of power, someone who's a I don't know a senior to me at my company or even someone who in my social group is a bit more higher up in the sort of social pecking order and they're continually putting me down or being difficult or even a partner that I'm romantically involved in. What are the hallmarks of someone who has control over their communication? And what are the hallmarks of someone that doesn't like what is it that makes because when you speak it's very feels very composed and controlled. What are you intentionally doing to achieve that effect? I'm wanting you to match my rhythm. I'm wanting you to come to my frequency. People get it wrong when they go big time to an 11. Big emotional reaction. If I have a big emotional outburst, am I signaling that I'm somebody who's trustworthy, reliable, and confident? Or am I signaling that I am out of my depth? I don't know what I want, and I am not to be believed. Right? because it's when you have an emotional outburst, everybody thinks this is you're just being emotional and they don't all of a sudden you're not credited for the truth of what you're saying. So sometimes emotions can get in the way of what needs to be said because of how you're delivering it. So when I say I'm going to talk to you in a way that's going to sound more controlled, it's I'm slowing down my words. I'm lowering my volume. Why? Because I want to pull you down here. And if I can pull you down here, well then we can talk about a lot harder things rather than feeling like I have to to rush. So if you want to talk to somebody in your relationship or somebody that's kind of higher up on the pecking order, so to speak, when you can show them that change doesn't bother you, when you can show them that you don't have to rush through this situation, people feel that you are giving them a sense of comfort. In other words, in conversation, everybody is looking for an anchor. When you go to a meeting, we listen to the person who's the anchor. They're usually the person who says a lot less, the person who's observing and listening rather than always giving their opinion about what you should be doing. Those are the people you don't listen to. As soon as you, if you've ever heard somebody say, "You know what I think you should do?" Does that ever make you want to do what they said? No. It's because they they've made it their idea. Now they're telling you what to do. If I were to say to you, you can't do that. What's the first thing you think of? Yes, I can.

### 庭审中的自信与可信度

在法官面前打官司时，**杰斐逊**会刻意营造一种“**我以前来过这里**”的感觉。他会在陪审团、法官和所有人进来之前，提前进入法庭，告诉自己：“这是我的客厅，其他人只是来做客的。”他会触摸椅子，把手放在扶手上，四处走动，感受这个空间，并以一种“我以前来过这里”的方式感受它。当他能散发出这种自信时，每个陪审员都会突然平静下来。他们会想：“我能依靠谁？谁更值得信任？谁更可信？”因为当你劝说、辩护时，最终归结为**谁更可信**。所以，当他能做到不情绪激动时，即使法官做出不利于他的裁决，他也会表现得好像这正是他想要的结果。陪审团永远不会真正知道有什么不同。但他见过其他律师，当法官做出不利于他们的裁决时，他们会翻白眼或表现出沮丧。陪审员会怎么想？“哦，他们一定不想让我听到这些信息，或者这对他们的案子不利。”所以，如果你总是情绪化地回应情况，却没有注意到谁在观察你，那是不利的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, it's it's the same kind of concept where it's me lowering to be the anchor in the conversation. And when you're in a case in front of a judge, is is there anything else that you're intentionally thinking about with, I don't know, your body language or the eye contact or any of these other things that you've learned over time are really important to get your message heard? I'm speaking like I've been there before. Explain that to me. walk into a room like you've been there before, as if everybody else is just visiting. So, what I do before every trial is I will go in there before the jury comes in, the judge comes in, everybody comes in and I say to myself, this is my living room and everybody else is just visiting. And so, I will touch the chairs. I will put my hands on the banisters. I will walk around. I will feel that space and and feel it in a way of saying I have been here before. And when I can exude that kind of confidence that every juror that watches, all of a sudden it calms them down. They go, who can I rely on here? Who's more trustworthy? Who's more credible? Because that's what it is when you're when you're persuading, when you are advocating your case, it's who ultimately it comes down to who is more credible. And so when I can not get emotionally flustered, like I've seen it so many times where a judge rules against me and I act as though that's exactly what I wanted. You know, I am I'm acting as though, thank you, judge. And the jur the juryy's never going to know really any different. But I've seen on other attorneys where the judge rules against them and they go or they roll their eyes or they act frustrated. And what does the juror think? Oh, they must not have wanted me to hear this information or this must have been bad for their case. So, if you are always reacting to situations in which you have to be emotional with in a sense that you're not paying attention to who's watching you.

</details>

### 非语言沟通的力量

当法官做出不利于你的裁决时，**杰斐逊**会表现得好像这正是他所预料的，不会显得沮丧。在真实的法庭上，法官有时会叫律师上前，在陪审团听不到的情况下做出决定。律师们离开会议后的表现，如果有人看起来沮丧，就会传递出“这是他们不想要的信息”的信号。**杰斐逊**的原则是，在整个庭审中，他只会提出一次真正重要的异议。因为对陪审团来说，异议意味着阻止证据呈现。如果你总是提出异议，就会传递出“有些信息我不想让你听到”的信号。但如果你有自信，知道只有一个异议对你的案件至关重要，那么陪审团就会知道你经验丰富，这不会影响你的案件。这一切都关乎**可信度**。如果他们不信任你，就不会信任你的客户或客户的案件。主持人**史蒂芬**指出，这凸显了**非语言沟通**的重要性。即使没有说出任何重要的话，你的肢体语言和对裁决的反应，比如防御性或沮丧，都会对你产生不利影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay. On that point, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, when you say rules against you, you mean during the trial there's something you request, the judge might say no, and you say, "Thank you, judge." You act as if you're not defeated. you act as though that's exactly what you expected, right? It's it's the whole idea of that's not going to shake shake me. So, a lot of the times you'll see in real court, not TV, uh the judge will say, "Counsel, can you approach?" And both attorneys come up and they play some kind of noise cancellation to where only the the attorneys can hear the judge and the judge is making a decision at that time that we don't want to hear to let the jury know. Why? Because it's information that might sway the case in some way and not be as objective. And you have to pay attention to who's how the attorneys are walking away after that meeting's done. If somebody looks defeated, it just signals, oh, this is information that they must not want or they're objecting. I've seen so many cases where there's one attorney who objects to everything. It's my rule if I really want to have one objection the whole trial because to the jury, an objection is me keeping evidence out. So, if you always object, always object, always object, you're just signaling there's information I don't want you to hear. But if I have the confidence of knowing there's really one objection I know that's going to be material to my case, that way they know I've been there before. This is not something that's going to be making or breaking my case. It's it's all of credibility. If they don't trust me, they're not going to trust my client or my client's case. I think also it illuminates to me how much of a communication is nonverbal. Because in that example, you're just talking about how they're watching your body language and how you've received something, right? And the, you know, if you were defensive, you know, with all those objections or if you were defeated in the judge's ruling, that would work against you even though it's really nothing was said, like nothing significant was said.

### 掌控节奏：像爵士乐队一样“在口袋里”

这是一种平衡，你需要知道是选择因为个人**自我**（Ego: 心理学中指自我意识，或自尊心）而做出反应，还是以更好的心态为客户辩护。如果你是证人，而我问你一个问题，你说的与我手中的证据相悖，我不会因此而慌乱。相反，我会把手放在文件上，说：“你确定吗？”这会立刻引起他们的兴趣：“发生什么事了？哦，这个律师知道。这个律师很自信，他有一种我称之为‘**在口袋里**’（In the pocket: 形容一种沉着、自信、掌控节奏的状态，如同爵士乐队成员完美配合）的临在感。”我不会过于激进，也不会过于退缩，我只是恰到好处，就像一个爵士乐队一样，每个人都踩在节拍上。我不会急躁，也不会放慢，我只是恰好“在口袋里”。主持人**史蒂芬**问这是否就是人们所说的**气场**（Aura）。**杰斐逊**认为也可以称之为**气势**（Swagger）或气场。你可以在任何情境中拥有它。他喜欢说“在口袋里”，因为它提醒他：**正确的时机就是我的时机**。这意味着他会根据自己的真实感受来调整，做最真诚的自己。如果让他快速读东西，听起来就不会那么好，因为那不符合他的个性。所以，如果他知道自己的言行与自己的价值观一致，并且他告诉自己“这里所有人都只是来做客的，我以前来过这里，你们不知道该去哪里，让我来告诉你们”，拥有这种心态，人们就会永远听你的。他们会觉得这很有吸引力，会想：“这个人怎么知道自己要去哪里？我可以跟着他。”这是一种自然的领导力，以一种“我知道自己要去哪里，我以前来过这里”的方式说话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. It's it's a balance of knowing am I going to choose to react because of personal ego of I didn't get in my way or am I having the better mindset of I'm advocating on behalf of my client like I I've been let's say you're a witness and you're opposed to me and I'm asking you a question and I think you said something that's contrary contrary to the evidence that I have right here rather than me getting messed up saying are you are you sure about that, Mr. Barl. Let me go. You know, I have this piece of paper here and I get really worked up versus me putting you said something and I put my hand on the the paper. I said, "You sure?" Like all of a sudden, it's a moment of it kind of peaks their interest of like, "What's happening? Oh, this attorney knows. This attorney is somebody who's confident and has this what I call in the pocket presence. I'm not trying to be too forward. I'm not trying to be too pack. I'm just in the pocket like a a jazz band." Like everybody is on everybody's on beat and so I'm not I'm not rushing. I'm not slowing down. I'm just right in the pocket. In the pocket. Is that what people call aura? Swagger maybe as some people call it. Yeah. Aura. You you could have it for anything in any context. I like to say in the pocket because it just reminds me of the right timing is my timing. And that is I'm I'm going to match how I need to be of what's most authentic, what's most genuine to me. If you were to ask me to read something really fast, it wouldn't sound that great because that's not that's not my personality. And so if I know that I am acting and speaking in accordance with the values that I hold and I'm saying everybody here is just is just visiting. This is I've been here before. Let me y'all don't know where to go. Let me show you. And I I have that kind of mentality, people will listen to you forever. They'll they'll find that attractive, saying, "How does this person know where they're going? Well, I can I can follow them." It's just it's natural leadership to speak in a way that says, "I know where I've I'm going. I've been here before."

</details>

### 提前准备，建立连接

**史蒂芬**认为，这对于有重要会议或约会的人来说，是个好建议：提前到达，熟悉环境。**杰斐逊**表示同意，这能避免因不熟悉环境而产生的额外焦虑，比如寻找东西或洗手间。他每次演讲前都会提前到达，看看房间是什么样子，与音视频工作人员打招呼，认识他们。如果你想成为一名更好的专业演讲者，**在演讲前与听众交流**。认识他们的名字，询问他们为什么来这里，表达感谢。当你能走进去与人接触时，那种感觉与完全陌生地进入一个房间是不同的，因为你无法感受到氛围。所以，提前去餐厅，不带手机，甚至更好。这会让你有一种“**我以前来过这里，我欢迎你来到我的空间**”的感觉。

I think that's probably good advice for people who um have important meetings or are going on dates. Yeah. To maybe get there ahead of time and familiarize yourself with the location. Yes. just so you you know you don't have the added anxiety of like stumbling through the physical environment like looking for the thing or trying to find the toilet or I don't know trying to figure out how to make the PowerPoint presentation airdrop onto the screen and all those kinds of things which we've all seen before. Yeah. I always anytime I go to speak um I I spoke this past week uh in Santa Barbara. I went ahead of time before my speaking time to to go I want to see what the room looks like. I want to see how how can I touch and say hi to the people that are working AV. How can I meet them? How can I if you really want to be better as a professional speaker? Talk to people in the crowd before you speak. Get to know people's names. It's going to naturally lower you. Get to know their names. Ask them why they're here. Say, "I'm so thankful that you're here. I'm really looking forward to the message and getting to talk to you today." when you when you can go in and touch people, it's a different sense than if I'm going into a room totally cold because you don't really have the vibe. You don't really know how that is. So, yeah, going into a restaurant ahead of time, that's great. Not bringing your phone, even better. You know, getting able to be a sense of knowing I I've been here before. I want to welcome you to to my space.

### 气场的本质：内心的平静与安全感

谈到有**气场**的人，**杰斐逊**认为那是一种**平静的频率**。他会想到那些让你感到最舒服的人，那些你可以完全做自己，放下一切的人。对他来说，那就是他祖父母的家。一走进那里，时间仿佛静止，他们只想了解他，关心他过得怎么样。那些有气场的人通常散发着光芒，因为他们**不试图向任何人证明什么**。他们自然地散发出那种魅力，源于对自己的了解和能力的自信。那么，气场的反面是什么呢？**不安全感**。那些真正真诚的人知道自己很好。如果你想急躁，我并不急。今天发生什么就发生什么。如果需要，今天真的必须完成吗，还是明天也可以？如果节奏慢一点。他发现有很多“**牛仔智慧**”（Cowboy Wisdom: 指一种实用、接地气、源于生活经验的智慧）在这些事情上，比如他来自德克萨斯州南部，那里的人就知道**合适的时机总会到来，不必强求**。所以，如果你想看气场的反面，那就是不安全感。它表现为**炫耀**（Name Dropping: 提及知名人物或品牌以抬高自己身价的行为）、急于交朋友、急于向你证明自己有多少钱等等。它表现为**为了取悦他人而成为一切，唯独不是自己**。

When we talk about um people that have aura, you must have met a lot of people in your career and your life generally that you felt had a sense of aura. Yes. What was it about them that gave them that aura? What is it? It's a frequency of peace for me. I think of people and you think of people in your life who you have felt most comfortable with. the person you feel like I I can just be myself. I can finally let everything down. Like for me, it was my my grandparents' house. As soon as I walk in, it's a different feeling of time kind of stands still. They want to know about me. They want to know how am I doing? They It's It's that feeling. I could talk about people who seem like they have aura and they just have a a glow about them. It's usually of they're not trying to prove anything to anybody. They just naturally exude that kind of charisma because of the security of knowing who they are and what they can do. And I guess what what's the opposite of that then? Sometimes it's easier to understand something by understanding the opposite. What would that look like? I would say that authentic people, authentic aura as you said, doesn't come from people securing themselves to you. That's for insecure people. The people who are authentic know that I am good exactly where I'm at. Oh, you want to rush? I'm I'm in really no rush. I'm What happens today happens today. Is it really due today or could it be done tomorrow if I I had to? if it's a slower pace. I I find that there is so much kind of what they call cowboy wisdom on these kind of things where and I'm from Texas in the south. So it's it's kind of this knowing that the right time will come when that time is right and not having to push that. So if you want to look at the opposite, it's the it's the opposite of aura is insecure. It's named dropping. It's having to be friends immediately. It's having to prove to you how much money I have or what. It's everything else being everything to everybody else except myself.

### 风格与真诚：不为取悦他人

那些有自己独特风格的人，自然会散发出**气场**。为什么？因为他们不在乎别人穿什么。这就是我喜欢的。我的女儿六岁了，我们试着给她搭配衣服，但根本不可能。她可以穿着豹纹芭蕾舞裙，戴着太阳镜，想穿什么就穿什么。你知道吗？她觉得自己是世界上最酷的。我永远不想剥夺她的这种感觉。那些有时尚感、了解自己的人，他们不必为了符合社会标准而看起来很酷，但他们真的在乎别人怎么想吗？通常，有气场的人不会在乎。

Like people who have a sense of style, their own sense of style naturally have an aura. Why? Because they don't care what in the world anybody else is wearing. This is what I like. My daughter, all right, she's six. We tried setting out clothes. Forget it. She she can come down in a leopard print tutu and her sunglasses and whatever she wants. And you know what? She thinks she is the flyest thing in the world. I mean that's I never want to take that out of her. The people who have a sense of fashion, a sense of who I am and they didn't have to look cool to anybody social standard, but it's do they really care what anybody else thinks? Usually the people with aura do not. Mhm.

### 煤气灯操纵：改变你的现实

**杰斐逊**的书出版后，人们最常谈论的章节是关于处理困难对话和难缠的人。其中一个被过度使用的词是“**煤气灯操纵**”（Gaslighting）。他给出的定义是：**煤气灯操纵是一种心理操纵，其中一个人故意撒谎或操纵另一个人，使其怀疑自己的现实、记忆或理智**。人们经常向他咨询关于煤气灯操纵的问题。他认为，每个人都可能在有意或无意中成为煤气灯操纵者，因为这源于一种自我保护的防御心理，不想让别人知道自己生活中发生的事情，所以会误导他人。煤气灯操纵的目的是**改变你的现实，让你质疑什么是真实的，什么不是真实的**。

And sometimes when you come up against I mean we were talking before we started recording about since this book's publication what have been people saying to you what have the chapters um what are the chapters that have stood out the most to people and you mentioned that it tends to be things around dealing with difficult conversations dealing with difficult people. Right. And one of the phrases that's been arguably overused a lot in society is this phrase gaslighting. Yeah. And the definition of gaslighting that I managed to pull was gaslighting is psychological manipulation where one person purposefully lies or manipulates the other to make them doubt their own reality, memory, or sanity. Mhm. Do people talk to you about gaslighting a lot? Yes. Now that you've written this book? Yes. And what do you think gaslighting? It's one of those things that's been used so often that we almost have to like pause for a second just to define it again. Yes. Well, let me put it this way. The difference between gaslighting and lying. Lying is a surface level of I could tell you instead of having a silver cup, this is a red cup. Well, that would be a lie. Gaslighting is I'm trying to alter your reality into mine. I'm I'm trying to make you question how other people perceive you, including myself. How you perceive yourself. If anybody's ever questioned, "Am I crazy? Am I the crazy one? Is it Is it me? Is it is everybody most likely you're probably being gas and here's the truth. I have been the gaslighter. Everybody has been the gaslighter whether they intentionally know it or not. Because it's all that feeling of preservation of defensiveness of I don't want people to know the truth of of what's happening in my life so I'm going to mislead. In gaslighting, the intent is to alter your reality, to make you question what is real and what is not.

### 煤气灯操纵：自我保护的深层动机

如果你做错了事，回家后故意向伴侣兜售一个版本的现实，让他们从根本上质疑自己所知道的一切，以避免被批评或控制他们，这是一种**自我保护**。举个例子，你和伴侣晚餐后回家，你心情很差，可能想转移生活中其他事情的注意力，于是你开始批评她在晚餐时分享的故事：“你为什么会说那种话？”她会说一切都很好，但你却说：“不，不，根本不好。你没看到他们怎么反应吗？听着，我知道你不想听，但大家都觉得你有点过分了，我必须告诉你。”你看到这如何开始改变她那一刻的感受了吗？**杰斐逊**见过这种行为的另一面，这是一种很难挽回的局面，除非双方都认真投入到关系修复中，才能找到一种真正坦诚相待的方式，因为你已经偏离了对话中的**彻底诚实**（Radical Honesty: 指在沟通中完全坦诚，不保留任何真实想法和感受）。所以，煤气灯操纵绝不能轻视。但人们也常常将其误用，比如当别人说了一些自己不喜欢的话时，就指责对方在“煤气灯操纵”自己，或者在争吵中指出对方伤害了自己感情的事实，也被称为“煤气灯操纵”。这几乎成了另一种形式的煤气灯操纵，甚至可以反过来。

So, I might do something wrong and then I might come home and know that I've done something wrong and intentionally try and sell my partner a version of reality that makes them fundamentally question what they know to try and spare me the critique or to control them. Yes. To protect yourself. It's it's it's selfpreservation. Say, let's say you and your partner had come home from a a dinner, all right? And you're just in a very critical mood and maybe you're trying to to distract from something else that's going on in your life and you're being critical of a story that she shared at dinner and you're like, why did you why would you ever say that? And she goes, everything was fine. You're like, fine. No, no, it was not. Did you not see how they reacted? No, no, no, no. Listen, I know you don't want to hear this, but everybody feels that, you know, you're a little bit much. You and I and I'm I'm the one that needs to tell you this. You see how you're all of a sudden is starting to alter how she feels in that moment. And I've seen the the other side of that. And it is it is not at all something that you can come back from without serious relationship work to be able to find a way to say okay what's how are we really walking in truth because you get so far away from radical honesty in conversation. So gaslighting is is is not something to be taken lightly. But I will say people often apply to the wrong thing. They'll use it as a sense of saying you're saying something I don't like so you're gaslighting me. You know, we're in an argument and you're pointing out something that hurt your feelings. Oh, that's gaslighting, you know, and and they they they use it as an excuse.

### 避免煤气灯操纵：回归真相与诚实

**杰斐逊**指出，人们常常用“煤气灯操纵”作为借口，这本身就是一种自我保护，只看到别人的缺点，不看自己的。主持人**史蒂芬**问，为什么我们不应该对他人进行煤气灯操纵？因为每次你这样做，你都在让自己离真相、离你真实的感受、离你们关系的真相越来越远。你是在对他人隐瞒现实，而不是**彻底诚实**地面对发生的一切。这会**损害关系，损害他人的自我价值感**。在很多方面，煤气灯操纵会**窃取他人的现实**，这需要付出巨大的努力才能弥补。它在某种意义上是一种掠夺。它既可以是故意的，也可以是无意的，作为一种自我保护的形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's almost a form of gaslighting. Exactly. That's exactly right. And it in a weird way, it can reverse that way. But imagine me saying something hurtful to you and you go, "That really hurt my feelings." I go, "That's just my boundary. I just I have a boundary about everything." Or, "This is you're just gaslighting me." You know, I've never met somebody who talked about their ex without saying my narcissistic ex. you know, I finally just got out of a narcissistic relationship. It's never us, right? It's always the other It's always the other person. And so, there's these words that we can kind of pepper insult into sentences that are also still another form if we look at it, a form of self-preservation. Look at all their bad and don't look at mine. Why is it important that we don't gaslight others? And I asked this question because everybody listening now is probably going to want the answer to the question, which is what what do I do about a gaslighter? Yeah. Yeah, but this is avoiding the responsibility that we all have a like a tendency or at some point in our life have gaslighted somebody else and you know I don't think my audience is just the gaslighted statistically clearly you're also all the gaslighters right so how do um why is it important that we don't gaslight other people and is there a way for us to avoid you know getting into a situation where our back's against the wall and we end up gaslighting one, it's important not to gaslight somebody because every time you do, you're removing yourself further and further from the truth, the truth of how you feel, the truth of your relationship. You are withholding reality from that other person rather than having radical radical honesty about what's what's happening. So it it degrades the relationship. It degrades another person's selfworth. And in many ways, gaslighting steals their reality. It's not something you can give back without a lot of work. It it's it's taking in some sense. Now, it can be absolutely intentional and it can also be unintentional as a form of self-preservation.

### 应对煤气灯操纵：放慢对话，坚持真相

如果你觉得自己正在被**煤气灯操纵**，秘诀就是**放慢对话节奏**。如果你在对话中保持冷静，即使对方说了一些让你质疑自己的话，比如“天哪，我真的说过那样的话吗？我真的伤害了他们的感情吗？”你也不会因此而陷入自我怀疑。相反，如果你说：“**史蒂芬**，我记得的不一样。”然后就此打住。那么对方可能会尝试其他方式，而你只需重复：“是的，我记得的不一样。”这代表着**坚持你所知道的真相**，而不是被他人牵着鼻子走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And if you feel like you are being gaslit, the secret to knowing is slowing down the conversation. If I am staying still in the conversation, meaning you could say something to me that's a form of gaslighting, making me question, did I oh my goodness, did I really say that? Did I really hurt their feelings? No, I did I and get into my head and I start kind of jumping around and trying to change what I did. But if I were to say, "Stephen, I remember that differently." And that's where I stop. Then you can try other things. And I'm going to repeat, "Yeah, I remember that differently." It's standing in the truth of what you know rather than being concerned and misled by giving someone the reins and the leash to drag you around.

### 谎言与煤气灯操纵的界限：意图是关键

主持人**史蒂芬**提到，他有时会不自觉地对他人进行**煤气灯操纵**，尤其是在关系紧张、争吵激烈时。他很难区分说一些不完全真实的话（或者只是自己的看法）和煤气灯操纵之间的区别。他问**杰斐逊**，在他看来，区别是否在于**意图**。**杰斐逊**肯定了这一点：**意图是关键**。煤气灯操纵的意图是“**我才是掌控者，而不是你**”。你试图控制叙事，扮演导演、制片人和演员的角色，为自己的目的服务。你希望别人按照你的方式行事，相信你的观点，并据此行动。你越是试图操纵现实，它就会变得越扭曲，甚至连你自己也会相信。优秀的骗子会让自己相信谎言就是真相。

And if I um if I think about I think it's thinking about all the times where I've I think I might have gas gas gas gas lit someone you know in relationships backs against the wall um and you're having an argument with someone or it's quite difficult in my head to know the difference between the word like just tell saying something that isn't necessarily true or is that is your perception of things versus like gaslighting is the is the difference in your mind intention like is if I if I give my version of reality yeah We were at that party. You said this thing. I saw the person roll their eyes and then they walked away. I think they're really offended. I think you offended them, right? What's the difference between that and me gaslighting someone of between lying and gaslighting or it's Yeah. Like I'm trying to understand in in that context you gave about going to a party, someone said something and then they walk up. What's the difference between if that's how you saw reality and you're communicating it versus gaslighting someone? It to the intention. It's the intention. The tension is I'm the one in control, not you. Okay. So, you are trying to control the narrative. You are trying to be both director, producer, and actor for your own agenda. That's right. For your own film and for control. I'm I'm the character in my own movie. I'm the main character. And you need to behave this way. You need to believe this. You need to act upon that. And so the more I can try to manipulate that reality and what's so wild is it becomes so manipulated that you believe it too. Now now that that falsehood has now become your fact in some sense that the really good liars convince themselves that that lie is is the truth.

### 谁更容易被煤气灯操纵？

**杰斐逊**认为，最容易受到**煤气灯操纵**的人是那些**焦虑型依恋**（Anxious Attachment: 一种依恋风格，表现为对亲密关系过度担忧，需要持续的确认和安抚）的人，他们无法自我调节，需要**共同调节**（Co-regulate: 指通过与他人互动来调节情绪和行为）。大多数男性擅长自我调节，给自己一些独处时间就能平静下来。但根据他的经验，大多数女性则倾向于共同调节，她们需要你也能让她们感觉良好。如果你不好，她们就不好。所以，那些最容易被煤气灯操纵的人，是那些需要共同调节、焦虑型依恋的人，他们需要不断地确认“你还好吗？你没事吧？你需要什么吗？你确定你没事吗？”而那些更回避型的人和通常更不安全的人则不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Is there a certain type of person that's more susceptible to being gaslit or to being victimized in any way with conversation in your view? Anxious attachment. The ones that are they people who can't regulate by themselves, they have to co-regulate. Meaning most of the time men are were good self-regulators. Just give me some time by myself. Give me an evening. Give me an hour. Let me walk outside. I'll and I'll regulate myself. Most of the time, it's been my experience. Women are not like that. They co-regulate most of them. They they need you to also make them feel good. They can't be good if you're not good. We're not good. I'm not good if if you're not okay. So, it's it's that whole I'm not okay if you're not okay. And so in many ways they need you to be able to calm down themselves and they they don't self-regulate as well. And so the people who are most susceptible to gaslighting are ones who need co-regulation. People who are anxious anxious attachment meaning they they need uh are you okay? Are you good? Do you need anything? Are you sure you're not okay? and versus the people who are more avoidant and three the the people who are are typically more insecure.

### 煤气灯操纵的性别差异与职场影响

**杰斐逊**认为女性比男性更容易受到**煤气灯操纵**，但这并不意味着女性不会对女性进行煤气灯操纵。根据他从读者那里得到的反馈，绝大多数是女性在谈论被煤气灯操纵的经历。他强调，每个人都可能在有意或无意中进行煤气灯操纵。研究表明，在异性恋关系中，女性报告的煤气灯操纵和强制控制率高于男性。男性也会报告，但频率较低，形式也不同。在职场数据方面，管理和组织心理学调查显示，女性更有可能被质疑能力、记忆或经历被轻视。在男性主导的领域，女性报告的煤气灯操纵率最高，而有色人种女性被告知她们的看法是错误的或误解的比例更高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So do you think women get gas lit more than men? Yes. But women still gaslight women, right? Of course. But just men are more when you're talking relationships. When you're talking relationships, that's my personal opinion is because from my feedback from the people that have read my book and the people who give me feedback on my book, Yeah. It's majority vast majority are are women. I'm not saying that's some empirical study on it. But what I will say is women are just as capable of gaslighting and gas women can certainly gaslight women. And it's I I'm saying this with the mindset of everybody gaslights whether they know it or not. And they have in the past. Most likely they can think of a time in the past where they did without knowing it. But it is that would be my opinion that most of the time men are the ones that do it to women. Just reading some research here that says multiple studies on emotional abuse in heterosexual relationships show women report higher rates of gaslighting and coercive control than men. Men do report gaslighting too, but less frequently and usually in different forms. Um, and as it relates to workplace data, surveys from management and organizational psychology show women are more likely to have their competence questioned, their memory doubted, or their experience dismissed. Women in male-dominated fields report the highest rates of gaslighting, and women of color report even higher rates of being told their perception is wrong or misinterpret or that they're misinterpreting things.

### 医疗与职场中的偏见：女性的真实经历

**杰斐逊**指出，在医疗环境中，女性的症状更不容易被相信，她们的疼痛常被低估，多种疾病（如心脏病、自身免疫性疾病、**多动症**（ADHD: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder，注意力缺陷多动障碍）和**自闭症**（Autism: 一种神经发育障碍，影响沟通和社交互动）等）的诊断也更晚。他认为，虽然不能一概而论男性比女性更多地进行煤气灯操纵，但根据他的经验和内容追随者的反馈，这似乎是符合现实的。许多女性在职场中感到自己的能力和决策力受到质疑，不被信任，甚至仅仅因为性别而被贬低。虽然这不总是煤气灯操纵，但当有人否认这种现实时，问题就出现了。**史蒂芬**也分享了他的经历，他曾观察到一些男性高管对女性同事表现出极度轻蔑，这种不一致完全是基于性别。他从未遇到过有男性向他抱怨自己被煤气灯操纵，但女性则总是如此。

Sounds like that tracks. And also in medical settings, women are less likely to be to be believed about their symptoms. Women's pain is underestimated. Women get later diagnoses for multiple conditions like heart disease and autoimmune disorders, ADHD and autism. And the list goes on and on and on. If I had to say who does more, you know, I'm not trying to put some kind of like headline of men do it more than women. In my experience, it tends to be the guy. And you know what does that that information show me? It shows me that that sounds about right. I do think from the people that follow my content, listen to my content because I stay very connected to my community of so many women say I feel like I'm in this workplace and they are doubting my competence. They're doubting my ability to make decisions. I'm not being believed. I'm putting I'm I'm being put down. I'm whether it's not even their experience. it's just because of their gender. And those are real those are real questions. Does that mean that that's gaslighting? Probably not all the time. But for me to say, ah, that's that's a dumb complaint. Uh, you know, that's just complaining. In many ways, when you start denying that reality, then you have the same problem. Do you know I am I've I've hired thousands of people over the last decade and I have to say sometimes it's it's difficult to understand the plight of someone else when you haven't lived their experience like you haven't been a woman or whatever. It's like very difficult. So, you kind of just have to take them for their word sometimes if you've not lived it yourself or you can look at data or whatever else. And I do have to say that I have experienced male executives who were extremely dismissive of their female peers in a way that was 100% inconsistent as it relates to genders. What I mean by that is I can think of several male executives over the years who I observed dismissing or diminishing or not giving the woman in the room the same credit really for no other reason than she was a woman. And so it's a very real thing. And it's not every man, I have to say this, but there is a certain particular type of person who for some reason in my experience would see a woman in the in the workplace or in the high sort of upper echelons of the professional um uh environment as being less than them just because of her gender. So when I hear, you know, what you're saying about women are predominantly come, you know, coming to you talking about these issues of gaslighting, it does kind of track with what I've seen. I'll tell you this. I've never had a man come to me in all this time that I've been from my book to my content this number of years ever say I think I'm being gaslit. It is it has always been the woman. Never. Never.

### 应对自恋者：限制互动，保持中立

关于如何应对**自恋者**（Narcissist），主持人**史蒂芬**问**杰斐逊**是否有男性来找他抱怨伴侣是自恋者。**杰斐逊**表示有，但他们总是说自己嫁给了自恋者，或者刚从与自恋者的关系中解脱出来，但从不承认自己是自恋者。那么，如何应对反复进行**煤气灯操纵**的自恋者呢？辞职是一个选择，但如果你认为这份工作值得，那么你需要采取一些措施。首先，**限制互动和接触**。少说话，使用中立的陈述。你可以限制身体接触，不必见到他们，不必与他们交流。即使他们就在你隔壁，你也不必成为他们的好朋友。其次，**理解你所处的“游戏”**。对自恋者来说，这是一种“赞美或激怒”的游戏。如果你不给予他们赞美，他们就会转而激怒你，以达到同样的目的。他们从你的沮丧中获得的乐趣，与从你的赞美中获得的乐趣一样多，因为他们都获得了控制感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What about the conversation around like dealing with narcissists? Cuz this feels like it's kind of one and the same. The words are used in the same sort of vernacular but Yeah. Do you have men coming to you saying that I think my partner's a narcissist? Yes, you do. Yeah, that I do have. Yeah, it's always it's always they're married to one or just got out of a relationship with one, but it's never them. And what what do you say to someone who is dealing with an artist who is dealing with someone who repeatedly gas gaslights them? Let's say it's in the context of work. Yeah. What are they meant to do? Quit their job. Well, that is an option. So, let's not rule that out. Okay. Um if it's if it's worth it to you because that's that's the question of what's your what's your purpose here? And this is where you're going to be forever. Then there's some things we need to put in place. But what are you to do? You are to limit the interaction like limit the exposure. Talk less neutral statements. So if you can many ways you can just limit the amount of physicality of I don't have to see you. I don't have to communicate with you. I know you work three doors down but I don't have to be your best friend and you certainly don't have to be mine. Two is understanding the game that you're in. It's a it's a game for narcissists of praise or provoke. Meaning, if I am not showering you with praise, then the narcissist will turn to provoke in order to create an argument for the same effect. They they delight in frustration just as may just as much as they delight in your praise because they get the same type of control.

### 自恋者的特征：无法为他人高兴，受害者心态

**杰斐逊**在法律领域见过很多他称之为**自恋者**的专家证人。他们永远不可能出错，缺乏同理心。每个人都有自恋倾向和特质，而自恋是一种可诊断的疾病。但如何应对日常的自恋者呢？你需要知道你所处的游戏类型，并且你不会玩这个游戏。你不需要对那个人说任何话。其次，**限制与他们的距离**。第三，**使用中立的陈述**，比如“知道了，谢谢分享，已阅”。这些话让他们无法抓住并继续对话。自恋者的主要特征是：他们**永远无法为除了自己之外的任何人感到高兴**。如果你说“**史蒂芬**刚得了奖，是不是很棒？”他们会说：“嗯，还行吧。我当年……”然后开始谈论自己。他们必须找到某种方式，把对话转变为世界对他们多么艰难和可怜，世界与他们作对，他们没有得到应得的，但他们同样值得。其次，他们有**受害者心态**。所有事情都以某种方式发生在他们身上。第三，他们**无法为他人感受**，他们不表达情感。他们非常在意别人怎么看他们，所以他们会给别人展示一个与给你的不同的形象。比如，一对夫妻可能关系很糟糕，但自恋者会向所有人展示他们的关系是完美的，让别人觉得你嫁给那个人真是太幸福了，而你却知道他们骗了所有人，这是一种非常无助的境地。

I have seen so many expert witnesses in my field that are that I what I would term are narcissists. They they they can never possibly be wrong. They they don't do empathy. And again, this is me with the understanding of hey, we all have narcissistic tendencies. You know, we all have narcissistic traits and narcissism is a diagnosible condition that you can have. I think more people would qualify more than they think. But how do you handle it daytoday is know knowing what kind of game you're in and it's a game you're just not going to play. I know I don't have to say anything to that person. Two, I'm going to limit my distance to them. And three, I'm going to use neutral statements. I'm going to use neutral statements like that's good to know. Thanks for sharing. Noted and things that they can't grab on to and continue to have in a conversation. When you think of like the hallmarks of of of a really really one of these types of people, what are the way the characteristics that I could should be looking out for? If I'm dealing with one such person who is is going to try and manipulate me, it's going to try and gaslight me. What what do they do? They can never be happy for anybody but themselves. They can't be happy for you. They can't be happy for other people. These are the type that if you were to say, "Hey, did you see that Stephen just got this award? Isn't that so great? You just nominated for whatever." And they go, "I mean, that's I guess that's fine. You know, I when I did this," and they start talking about themselves. They can never be happy for somebody else. They can't be happy for you. It's they have to find some way to turn the conversation of why the world is so hard and so pitiful for them that the world was against them and they couldn't get it, but they were just as deserving. I mean, I guess that's fine. And I mean, you know, I do this, but nobody nobody listens. Nobody really cares. They find that they have a very victim mentality. So, two is a victim mentality. Everything happens to them in some way. And three, they can't feel for other people. They don't do emotion. It's it's always about the perception of what others would think. They're very very sensitive to how others might portray them. So, they're going to give you a different view than they give other people. And so, the couple might be terrible, but for a narcissist, they're going to put on face that the relationship is perfect to everybody else. And everybody goes, "You you must be so blessed to be married to that person." And you're going, "You kidding me? They're they're fooling everybody." And it's a very helpless position.

### 识破自恋者：利用他们对公众形象的在意

**杰斐逊**在法律领域也遇到过**自恋者**试图利用他。这些专家证人认为自己的意见无可置疑，即使有其他专家持相反意见。他们常常表现得高高在上，认为自己的意见就是一切，质疑他们是多么愚蠢。通常，识破他们的关键在于，如果你觉得这个人不讲道理，永远不会让步，那么你可以问：“你觉得陪审团会喜欢这样吗？”或者“你觉得其他人会同意你的看法吗？”他们会立刻改变，以迎合陪审团的想法。当**杰斐逊**提到“别人”时，他们就会开始表演，因为他们知道**公众的看法就是一切**。他们需要所有人都喜欢他们，崇拜他们，希望自己的想法是最好的。所以，他们会操纵局面，像变色龙一样，确保所有人都喜欢他们，至少在他们自己看来是这样。这不是一个理性的想法。所以，他们通常会改变自己的观点，使其听起来更易于接受，即使他们在作证两小时后才承认这一点。自恋者通常比普通人话更多。

Have you ever had a narcissist try and pray on you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in the legal field, man. Expert witnesses have opinions to them that are unquestionable. You can't this is their opinion and nobody else could ever argue with it when I have another expert who says just the opposite. So a lot of the times they are very condescending you know that's fine and they have their opinion and this is all there is and how dumb of you to ever question me. And usually what gives it away is if I feel like this is somebody that okay they're they can't be reasonable. They're never going to give an inch on what's reasonable. I will ask this. I'll say this is typically in a deposition. I'll say and you think the juryy's going to like that. And or you think other people are going to agree with you and all of a sudden they kind of change in an instant to be able to match what the jury is going to think. So, if I were to say, and you think and you think that's okay, and you think others are going to find that okay, and you think that the jury when they hear this, they're they're all going to agree with this very hardline opinion. I've seen it every time. Or they that's it's only when I reference other people, the presentation of themselves to other people that they kind of put on a a show. Why? because they know that the perception of the crowd is everything. They need everybody to like them, to fawn over them. They they want their idea to to be the best. And so they will manipulate the situation to be the chameleon to to make sure that everybody loves them at least in in their mind. It's not a it's not a reasonable thought. So they will typically change their opinion to sound more palatable even though they could have admitted to that you know two hours into the deposition. Do they tend to talk more or less than the average person in the room? Much more.

### 不安全感与自恋的界限：成长的意愿

主持人**史蒂芬**问，不安全感和**自恋**（Narcissism: 一种心理状态，表现为极度自我中心、需要他人关注和赞美，缺乏同理心，且对批评敏感）之间是否存在一条细线。他观察到一些人总是把话题引回自己，这让他觉得他们只是有点不安全，寻求认同。**杰斐逊**认为两者都可能存在。他会说**并非所有不安全的人都是自恋者，但所有自恋者都是不安全的**。如果非要划一条线，那就是**对成长的兴趣**。不安全的人会寻找成长和建立联系的方式。而自恋者则不寻求与任何人建立联系，他们只希望别人支持和取悦他们。所以，他们对成长没有兴趣。对他们来说，他们已经学会了所有需要学习的东西，他们是最好的，无法再进步了。这就是他认为的区别。

<details>

Is there a thin line between just being insecure and being a narcissist? Because you know one of the things I was thinking about is you said earlier that they tend to bring everything back to themselves. And I was thinking about all the people that I know that if we were having a conversation about your book doing really really well, the first response to that would be their mention of their own book like they would immediately bring it straight back to something about them. And I was wondering some of those people I just have in the category of just being a little bit insecure and that they just, you know, they're a search for validation. So I'm wondering where where you think the line might be between sort of narcissistic behavior and just like extremely insecure. Maybe there's not a line. Maybe extreme insecurity is narcissism. Both can be true. You know, I' I'd say that not all insecure people are narcissists, but all narcissists are insecure. Um, I would I would say that if I had to give some kind of line, it would be the interest for growth. Insecure people are looking for ways to grow and to secure and attach. Narcissists, they're not looking for anybody to attach on to. They're looking for people to support them, you know, to please them. And so it they have no interest in growth. They to them they've learned all they've have to learn. I I am the best. I I cannot improve anymore. That to me would be the difference.

### 应对自恋者：不追逐他们的言语

**杰斐逊**在生活中和法庭上与**自恋者**打交道时，他们无法利用他，因为他**不追逐他们的言语**。他发现对话中最大的问题之一是，自恋者和**煤气灯操纵者**会挖一个坑，然后期望你来填补。这意味着他们会说一些让你沮丧的话，而你却说：“不，不，不是那样的。你不记得了吗？”然后你开始追逐他们的言语，他们又挖一个坑，你不断追逐，最终筋疲力尽，因为你一直在试图堵住漏洞，而不是进行真正的对话。当他能给出非常清晰的定义和信号，比如“知道了”，他就会停在那里。他会放下铲子，留在原地。他可能会说一句中立的话，比如“明白了”。他不必追逐，不必说任何话。对那些有自恋特质的人来说，一旦他们意识到你不会玩他们的游戏，他们就会去找别人。如果你遇到过那些情绪上有毒的人，他们总是带着问题来找你，而你告诉他们你现在无法处理，十分钟后，他们的问题就解决了，因为他们已经去找别人倾诉了。

When you dealt with narcissists in your own life and in the courtroom, what is the reason why they couldn't prey on you? What did you do as defense to stop their games, their typical games working on you? I don't chase their words. Often, one of the biggest things I see wrong in conversation is a narcissist will, same for a gaslighter, they'll dig a hole. All right? And then they expect you to fill it. Meaning, they're going to say something to frustrate you and you go, "No, no, that's not what happened. Don't you remember?" and you start chasing it and then they just dig another hole and you keep going and you keep going and you're exhausted because all you've been doing is trying to plug holes. You're not having a real conversation. And when I can give it a very clear definition, a very clear signal of noted, you know, I'm just going to stay right there. I'm going to see I'm going to put down the shovel and stay right there with them. and maybe I'll say something as neutral as got it. I don't have to chase it. I don't have to say anything. And and to me, the the people that have those narcissistic traits, once they realize that they're going to have no game with you, that you're not going to play, they find somebody else. They find somebody. If you've ever had somebody come to you and they're the more emotionally toxic type of person, they always have some kind of problem. They come with you and they have this problem. and you go, I I just I can't right this moment. I will. And 10 minutes later, what's happened? They don't have that issue. They've already gone to talk to somebody else.

### 保持镇定：应对高自尊者的策略

**史蒂芬**提到他曾看过**达蒙·达什**（Dame Dash）在《**早餐俱乐部**》（The Breakfast Club: 一档美国电台节目）上的采访，**达蒙·达什**因破产而情绪激动，而主持人**查拉马涅**（Charlemagne）则非常放松，偶尔会说**达蒙·达什**破产了。**达蒙·达什**则非常冲动，试图证明自己没有破产。**史蒂芬**认为这段视频展示了如何应对一个**自尊心极强的人**。**查拉马涅**始终保持冷静，无论对方音量多大，情绪多激动，甚至开始人身攻击，**查拉马涅**的举止、语气、姿态都没有改变。这种**不为所动**（Unbothered: 形容一个人不受外界干扰，保持平静和镇定）的态度，让**达蒙·达什**感到非常恼火，他试图说出更具攻击性的话。**史蒂芬**认为这与**杰斐逊**所说的“不追随他们”的观点不谋而合。他们想把你拉到某个地方，进入某种冲突，但如果你拒绝，并坚持自己的观点，看着他们被激怒是很有趣的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I was watching uh Dame Dash on the Breakfast Club. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's really another Breakfast Club, but it's it's Dame Dash is on there because he he was um he filed for bankruptcy and Charlemagne is sat there and Charlemagne is I've actually interviewed both of them, both Dame and Charlemagne. And Charlemagne is very relaxed and every once in a while just tells Dame Dash that he thinks he's broke. And then Dame Dash is like very like hotaded and like trying to prove prove all the reasons why he's not broke and like really like you know gassing him. And I it was it was an interesting it's an interesting video to watch. I think it's the more recent one that came out within the last year because it does show in my view how to deal with someone who has a very has a significant ego. Yeah. Which is Charlemagne just never changes state. Like no matter what the volume is, no matter how much emotion, no matter when he starts calling him some quite personal insults, Charlemagne's demeanor, his tone, his posture, yeah, doesn't change. Unbothered. unbothered. And you can see it's super triggering that you just can't get to this guy. Like it looks like Dame is like really annoyed that he and he tries to say more offensive things. He calls you're a you're this, you're that, the other. And it's funny cuz I was watching it this morning and it for me it kind of tracks with a lot of the stuff you're saying about like just not going with them. Yeah. Just not following them where because they want you to go somewhere and there's a certain conflict they want to get in with you and if you just kind of refuse and just stay anchored to whatever your point of view is, it's it's funny to watch. They want to push you.

### 掌控自我价值：不被他人左右

**杰斐逊**回忆起他父亲的例子。当他们开车时，如果有人紧贴着他们的车尾，他父亲不会加速或生气，而是会把车开到路肩上，然后说：“你走你的，我走我的。”他父亲就是这样**不为所动**。很多人在开车时会路怒，大声抱怨。但他父亲从不因此而烦恼。他意识到，**我的价值和自我价值，绝不取决于你认为我应该去哪里**。这又回到了那个想法：如果你想告诉我天空是紫色的，那就去说吧。我不需要是对的，你也没有能力推我。我可以移动，你有你自己的路。我知道我的车道，我知道我的速度，我不需要与任何人保持一致。所以，当一个人不为所动时，并不是因为他们不在乎，而是因为他们**理解并辨别**：我知道此刻我是谁，我为什么要尝试成为别人？

<details>

Yeah. My my dad I can remember growing up I'd be in the passenger seat. He's driving and you ever had it where somebody you're in the passenger seat and somebody's just rearing the bumper right on them and and I and I'd be looking in the side mirror. I'm like I kind of start stressing out for him. You know, somebody's really riding the bumper, you know, right behind him. And I mean just like clockwork. what he would do, we have shoulders on our in on the roads there in Texas, and rather than trying to speed up or get mad, he would just kind of pull over to the shoulder and he would say this every time. He'd say, "Go on with your bad self." Every time he go, "Go on with your bad self in the rearview mirror." Like, that's how unbothered he was by that of I feel like so many people get road rage as so many people talk out loud to the cars while they're while they're driving. And he it just never got him worked up. And realizing my value and my worth of knowing who I am is not at all determined by where you feel I should go. It goes back to that idea of if you want to tell me the sky is purple, knock yourself out. You know, I I don't have to be right and you don't have the ability to to push me. I can move and you have your own. I I know my lane. I know my speed. I don't have to match anybody else's. So when somebody is unbothered, it's not because they don't care. It's not for lack of care. It's an understanding. It's discernment of knowing I know who I am in this moment and why in the world would I try to be anybody else?

### 你的反应决定了旁观者的解读

**史蒂芬**认为，如果所有人都能做到不被激怒，生活会更平静。他回忆起观看**达蒙·达什**和**查拉马涅**的采访时，当**达蒙·达什**说出非常冒犯的话时，他作为观众会立刻观察**查拉马涅**的反应，以判断**达蒙·达什**说的是否属实。当**查拉马涅**只是笑笑，毫不在意时，**史蒂芬**立刻觉得那不可能是真的，因为**查拉马涅**看起来并不在乎。**杰斐逊**解释说，这并非缺乏关心，而是因为**查拉马涅**非常了解自己。如果你现在告诉我你讨厌我的紫色衬衫，它是我见过最丑的，这会影响我吗？不会，因为我没有穿紫色衬衫。你已经了解自己的特点，知道自己穿什么。这不仅仅是衣服，我穿着我的自信，穿着父母和所爱之人赋予我的一切，我穿着信仰的盔甲。如果你说我的衬衫是紫色的，这根本不会影响我，因为那不是我。人们常常陷入争论“不，我没有穿紫色衬衫”，但你为什么要争论呢？**亚伯拉罕·林肯**（Abraham Lincoln: 第16任美国总统）有句名言：“**永远不要和傻瓜争论，因为旁观者永远分不清两者的区别**。”所以，你需要知道“不，我清楚自己是谁，我穿着什么。”你的反应决定了旁观者如何解读发生的一切。

<details>

Wouldn't life be amazing if we could all be untriggerable? It'd be more peaceable, that's for sure. It's interesting because again, just reflecting on that interview I watched this morning, when Dame Dash calls Charlemagne something really, really offensive, I noticed that as a viewer, I immediately look at Charlemagne to see his reaction to figure out if what Dame Dash just said was true. And do you see what I'm saying? So he he turned to him and said, "You're ex, right?" And then Charlemagne just kind of laughed and like it just it was like water off a duck's back. So immediately as the viewer I go, "Well, that can't be true then because Charlemagne doesn't seem to care." Exactly. Well, it's it's not the lack of a care. It's it's just the opposite. It's all the more care of knowing who he is. So, if I were to tell you right now, I hate your purple shirt. It's the most ugliest purple shirt I've ever seen, Stephen. Like your shirt is so ugly in that purple. Does it affect you whatsoever? No, because I'm not wearing a purple shirt for anyone that's an apple. That's right. That's a good point. Right. But you see how you you already know the characteristics of of you. You already know what you're wearing. And it's not just your clothes. I'm I'm wearing my confidence. I'm wearing everything that your parents, your your loved ones have instilled and put on you. I am I am wearing the armor of my faith. I I am I have all these other things that I'm wearing. And if you want to say my shirt's purple, that that doesn't affect me at all because that's that's not who I am. And so so often people get mixed up of arguing about no, I don't have a purple shirt on. When why would you ever argue with that? They they it's that quote by Abraham Lincoln that I love. if never argue with a fool because an onlooker can never know the difference, right? And so it's it's knowing no, I I know exactly who I am and what I'm wearing. And this sort of speaks to the fact that your reaction determines how onlookers will interpret everything that's happening.

### 沟通是需要投资的纪律

对侮辱你的人来说，最糟糕的事情就是你**笑出来**。这会让他们非常恼火。就像欺凌者说一些旨在伤害你的话，如果你反问：“你是不是想让我难堪？”他们可能会说是或不是，但无论如何，你都让他们意识到你不会有任何反应。你向他们表明，这样做对他们来说毫无乐趣。所以，他们会去找别人。**你的反应总是决定了对话的走向**。很多人现在还远未达到这种境界，他们很容易被激怒，寻求正义。对这些人来说，这就像一块需要锻炼的肌肉，或者说，这是一段通往精通的旅程。**杰斐逊**认为，**沟通是一种纪律**。就像人们投资于健康、自助书籍和播客一样，你必须投资于你的沟通。学校不会教你这些。他上法学院时，人们以为他在那里学到了这些，但法学院教你如何解读法律，而不是如何解读人。如果你是一个有专业知识并乐于分享的人，那么这些知识要么是付出了巨大的个人代价才获得的，要么是你编造出来的。他之所以知道这些，是因为他亲身经历过，经历过好的一面，也经历过坏的一面。这绝不是自然而然就会发生的事情。

Like, you know, oh, the worst thing you could do to somebody who insults you is laugh. I mean, what does it do? It I mean, it it it infuriates them, right? But when the same thing with a bully, a bully says something to you that they know is meant to hurt you. And if I were to turn around and say, "Did you say that to to embarrass me?" I mean, what are they going to do? They they could say yes, they could say no. But either way, you're realizing I'm not going to get any reaction. What you're showing them is for you to do this, it's just not going to be fun for you. It's going to be zero fun whatsoever for you. And so, they'll find that with somebody somebody else. It's it's always your reaction that's going to determine how the conversation goes forward. There's a lot of people listening right now that are a long way away from that. Very easily triggered. Yeah. Seeking justice, you know, whatever it might be. For those people, is it like a muscle they have to build or is there what is the journey to getting to this level of sort of mastery? It's a discipline. It is in the same way that people invest in so many other things in our life. We invest in our health. We invest in self-help books. We invest in the podcasts that we listen to. It is the same. You have to invest in your communication. We don't get taught in school. We don't, you know, I I went to law school. People think I learned this in law school. No. Law school teaches you how to read the law. It doesn't teach you how to read people. You had to. To me, if you are somebody that is in a position of expertise and to share something, it either came at great personal cost or you're making it up like it it it is something that you have learned, right? It's true. And so I mean whether it's through skill, knowledge, training, it's I've you want to know how that I know these things because I've lived it. You know, I I have been on the bad side. I've been on the good side. And it's it is not it's never something that's just going to come to you.

### 情绪觉察：在疲惫时坦诚沟通

我们是情感动物，也是荷尔蒙动物。那么，我们的情绪、荷尔蒙、健康、身体和认知状态，与走进法庭并做好准备有什么关系呢？如果你睡眠不足，饥饿，又刚吵过架，压力重重，那么要表现出色的沟通能力并赢得争论会困难得多。**杰斐逊**认为，**情绪觉察**（Emotional Awareness: 识别和理解自己及他人情绪的能力）至关重要。如果你只是对对方的情绪反应做出回应，你每次都会错失机会。在人际关系中也是如此。如果你回应的是反应，你就会失去真正满足需求的机会。所以，即使在法庭上，如果他知道自己有点困、有点饿、有点脾气暴躁，他可以选择假装没事，或者他可以走到陪审团面前说：“早上好，各位。我必须承认，我有点脾气暴躁，今天早上不太顺利。还有人脾气暴躁吗？”大家都会点头。现在，我们不再是言语上的联系，而是情感上的联系。现在，你更信任我，我也更信任你，因为我更真诚了。

We are emotional creatures and we're hormonal creatures. Mhm. So, how do how do you think about our emotions, our hormones, our health, our physical, cognitive state as it relates to like walking into the courtroom and being ready? Like how much of it, you know, because if I've had zero hours sleep and I'm, I don't know, hungry and whatever else and I'm had an argument, I'm stressed about something, it's going to be significantly harder to show up and be a great communicator and win the argument against somebody, right? So, do you think about these things all the time? I mean, the emotions are are right there connected to the words. And what do you how do you prepare to be ready for battle? It's an emotional awareness of how I'm feeling and also how the other person is because if I just respond me Yeah. If I respond to their emotional reaction, I'll miss it every time. Same thing in relationships. If I respond to the reaction, I'll lose that moment to actually speak to the need. So even in the courtroom for me, if I know that I'm a little sleepy, I know I'm a little hungry, I'm a little grumpy, you know what? I can either try and pretend that I'm not. Or I might get up in front of the jury and say, "Good morning, everybody. I have to admit to you, I'm a little grumpy. I didn't need all that much this morning. Anybody else grumpy?" And everybody starts to kind of nod. And now, hey, we all kind of relate, not to my words, but now to the feeling. And now you trust me more. I trust you more because I'm being more authentic.

### 坦诚脆弱：建立信任的基石

**史蒂芬**问，人们是否应该在人际关系中坦诚自己的状态。**杰斐逊**认为绝对应该。因为**完美是无法引起共鸣的，挣扎和情感才是**。如果你来找我，问我过得怎么样，我说“很好，一切都很好”，而实际上并非如此，我是在真诚还是在伪装？但如果我说：“告诉你吧，我今天早上过得很糟糕，它以我意想不到的方式考验了我，我的心思完全不在这里。”这会让你更信任我还是更不信任我？每次都会更信任。所以，当你能与人分享你的挣扎时，我不是指你内心最深处的渴望和挣扎，而是说，我的妻子**塞拉**（Sierra）和我每天早上都会互相问候。在她送完孩子后大约十分钟，我们会聊聊彼此的近况。她问我或告诉我最多的就是：“你跟我说了你做了很多事，但你没告诉我你的感受。”我认为这是很多男性和很多人默认的真实情况。我们会告诉你发生了什么，我的日程是什么，我在做什么，但我很少告诉你我的感受。我们把这些情绪都压抑起来，因为它们依然存在。但如果我能与你分享我的挣扎，发生的一切，不仅是好的，更重要的是不好的，那总能带来真诚。

And do you think people should do that in their own interpersonal relationships which is just call out their state? Absolutely. Because perfection is not relatable. Struggle is emotions are. If I were to come to you and say and you say how are you and I go good everything's good when it is not. Am I being authentic or am I being fake? But if I were to say, "Let me tell you, I've had a morning and it's tested me in a way I was not expecting and my mind is just not here." Does that make you trust me more or trust me less? Trust me more every time. So, when you can share your struggles with people, I'm not talking about your deepest inner desire struggles. I'm saying, let me put it this way. Sierra and I check in with each other every morning. It's my wife. And it's only about 10 minutes after she drops the kid off, uh, kids off. And we kind of run through how we're doing. And the number one thing she asks me or tells me, he goes, "You told me a lot about what you're doing. You haven't told me a lot about how you're feeling." And that's that's the truth of the default, I think, of a lot of men and a lot of people. I'm going to tell you what's going on, what's on my agenda, what I'm doing. I haven't told you a lot about how I'm feeling. And we store all that stuff up because it's still there. But if I can share with you, what is my struggle? What's happening? Not just the good, but more importantly the the bad. I mean that it's always going to bring that authenticity into the play.

### 性别差异与情感表达：寻找中间地带

男性和女性在很多方面都非常不同。男性通常情绪更内敛，或者说更“平”，而女性则有更多的情绪波动。这可能与荷尔蒙变化有关。这意味着在浪漫关系中，我们有时会处于非常不同的波长。**史蒂芬**分享说，他的伴侣在七年里可能只见过他哭一两次，而他可能见过她哭五百次甚至更多。他觉得这就像我们是不同的物种。我们花了很多时间讨论男性需要更情绪化，需要改变自己的方式，因为这是问题所在。但反过来呢？女性是否也需要思考，我们是否需要**在中间地带相遇**？**杰斐逊**认为肯定有在中间地带相遇的空间。**史蒂芬**认为，当他表现出情绪时，他的妻子**塞拉**反而会更镇定。他不是指大喊大叫，而是指**投入其中，说一些让她感受到你真诚感受的话**。男性常常难以表达悲伤或懊悔。这在很多关系中，尤其是在男性中很常见，因为我们从小就被教导不要哭泣。

Women and men are very different in many ways. And yeah, we're very different in many ways. Men are I I don't know. It feels like men just, you know, and again, I'm I'm stereotyping here, so it's not all men and of course people are different, but just speaking generally, the stereotype is that men are a typically a bit more emotionally composed or should I say flat and women have uh more emotional fluctuations. One could look at hormone changes throughout the month and talk about why that might be, etc., etc. I've had many scientists here talk to me about hormone fluctuations and how that impacts how someone feels. But what this means in our romantic relationships is sometimes we meet each other on very different wavelengths. Yeah. So in my relationship, my partner's probably seen me cry once, right? In seven years, maybe twice, but probably once. I've probably seen her cry 500 times, maybe more. Yeah. So it feels it almost feels like I'm just going to be completely honest because I just think it's helpful. So you can [ __ ] me up online if you want. But I it sometimes feels like we're we're a different species. Like the way that I interact with my guy friendss and the way that the sort of wavelength that my romantic partner my my my girlfriend operates on are very very different. So it's very easy to like misunderstand. And we spend a lot of time talking about how men need to be more emotional and more I don't know men need to change how the how they are. Yeah. Because it's the problem. But what about the like what about the other side of that which is do do women also need to think about do we need to meet in the middle is what I'm saying there certainly is space to meet in the middle like who's right in that I don't know is is is there a person that's right in this configuration am I meant to be way more emotional and be or or is she meant to be way more composed cuz I I think that's often how both sides feel. They feel like, why aren't you coming to my wavelength on this issue? But I think here's what you're missing. She would be much more composed if you would be more emotional. And so a lot of the times what I find in my own marriage is when I show emotion, the more composed she is. I mean, if I start screaming and crying, I I think my girlfriend's I'm not saying screaming. I'm I'm saying show emotion. What kind of emotion of being in it with her? And what does that look like? That means you're going to say things that make her feel it. There's a difference if I just go static. That's what happens to me a lot. Uh truthfully, is let's say we're in an argument about something or something came up and see emotional about it. If I dismiss it, okay, this is so dumb really right now. This is because arguments never come at the most opportune time. They come at the worst possible time. Yeah, that's hello. That's all relationships. If I dismiss it, right, does that make her come closer to me or further away from me? And if I'm pushing her further away from me, why would she not be more emotional? Why why would she why would she not be further away from me if I dismiss that? For every woman to be more emotional as a man, tears are not necessary. connection is being in it is saying things that make her feel that you're you're genuinely feeling it. The difference I find with men and what I struggle with is I can say that I'm sad. I have a hard time expressing sad. I can say that I'm really regretful. I have a hard time expressing that. I think that is something that happens a lot with most relationships and I think that happens a lot with men of we were emotional and we got taught early that you you were not to cry. We I couldn't even tell you how many times I ever saw my dad cry.

**史蒂芬**提到，他父亲在情绪上要么愤怒，要么完全平静，没有中间状态。**杰斐逊**认为，这一切都归结于**修复**（Repair: 在人际关系中，指在冲突或伤害发生后，通过沟通和行动来弥补裂痕，重建信任和连接的过程）。你修复的速度有多快？这意味着我能否**验证**（Validate: 承认并确认他人的感受和经历是真实和合理的）她的感受？**验证就是修复，它不是弱点，而是修复**。在他看来，关系破裂并非因为一次大的失败，而是因为一百个本可以修复却未曾修复的时刻。你只是选择了不去做，或者你本可以说“对不起”，但你却忍住了。你本可以选择验证她的感受，但你却说“那很蠢”。正是这些数百个微小的时刻，最终导致了关系的破裂，因为你在那些微小的时刻选择了不修复，你说“这太蠢了，这太小事了”。是的，它很小，但这更说明你应该尽快修复。所以，当你能验证这些担忧时，即使你说她情绪化，你也不是。当你进入那种平静模式时，那是你选择做一些不同的事情，而不是总是说同样的话，而不是轻蔑，而不是试图说服她不应该有这种感受。如果你验证，如果你说“我能理解你为什么会有这种感受。如果这是你的解读方式，你知道吗？我不怪你会有这种感受。我能理解。那听起来很可怕。那听起来很令人沮丧。”如果你能做出这个艰难的选择，暂时放下你的沮丧，放下你的个人沮丧，并验证她的感受，说出能满足她需求的话，让她感到被倾听、感到安全、感到自己没有过分，那么一切都会缩小。你知道吗？我的沮丧也会消失。为什么？因为一切都好转了。我们有了修复的时刻。如果我仍然非常沮丧，那么我就可以提出来：“嘿，我能跟你说一件你说的让我很困扰的事情吗？”然后你再去做。

I think this is it. The modeling we had as well is my dad was either angry or completely static. And when I say angry, he was very very rarely angry. But but when I saw him engage with my mom on an emotional level, it would be him yelling back, right? If he wasn't yelling back, he was completely just like he was just very calm, static, emotional. There was no in between. Yeah. It's it all comes down to repair. How quickly you get to repair. That means can I validate the feeling that she has? Validation is repair. It's not weakness. It's repair. In my world, relationships don't fall apart because of one big failure. They fall apart because of a hundred moments where repair could have happened and it didn't. You just chose not to. Or you could have said, "I'm sorry," but you withheld it. I could have chose to validate how you're feeling, but I said that's stupid. And it's it's those the hundreds of those little bitty moments where all of a sudden, no wonder your your world's apart because you chose in those little bitty moments not to do the repair because you said, "Ah, this is so stupid. This so small." Yeah, it is small. All the more reason why you should repair pretty quickly. And so when you can validate those concerns, even when you say she's being emotional, you're not. When you go into that static mode, when I go into that static mode, it's a choice by me to do something different, not say the thing I always say, not be dismissive, not find ways to try and convince her that she shouldn't feel this way, but if I validate, if I say things like, I can see how you feel that way. If that's how you interpreted it, you know what? I don't blame you for feeling that way. I I can see that. That sounds scary. That sounds frustrating. If I can choose that it's it's this like this isn't the key for me and trust me I'm talking to myself here. Yeah. Right. Because every every guy I feel like can be like, "Okay, this is right." And if I can make the hard choice in that moment to put aside my frustration just for a moment, put aside my personal frustration and validate the feeling and say words that speak to her need, the need to feel heard, the need to feel safe, the need to feel like she's not being too much. Then all of a sudden, it all shrinks. And you know what? my frustration kind of goes away. Why? Because everything's better now. We've we've had moments of repair. And then if I still am really frustrated, then I can bring it up. Hey, can I can I bring up something to you that you said that's really bothering me? And then you do it.

### 捍卫自主权：在关系中划定界限

**史蒂芬**问，作为男性，如何避免为未来树立一个糟糕的先例。他担心如果总是认同伴侣的感受，寻求修复，然后当她高兴时就放手，那么未来可能会有更多要求，导致自己失去自主权和控制。他见过很多男性朋友因为从不为自己挺身而出，最终生活在“牢笼”里。他父亲也曾过度选择不争吵，导致长期来看生活变得艰难。**杰斐逊**认为**史蒂芬**所说的，是**对自主权的恐惧，对权利的恐惧，对自由被侵蚀的恐惧**。在濒临破裂的关系中，最常听到的词是“被囚禁”。男性感到被囚禁，这实际上是缺乏自信的表现。他们认为如果自己愿意做一些不同的事情，就会失去其他一切。这是一种**零和思维**（Zero-sum thinking: 一种认为资源总量固定，一方的收益必然是另一方的损失的思维模式）。但两者可以同时存在。你仍然可以验证她的感受，同时坚持你所知道的真相。你仍然可以不同意她。每次我们进入对话，我们都带着一种需求：被爱、被理解。就像对待孩子一样，当孩子尖叫、哭泣或说“不”时，我们不会因此而生气。我们会想：她饿了，她累了，她害怕了。我们常常忘记，我们都是长大的孩子，内心都有这些隐藏的需求。所以，你仍然可以坚持自己的立场。

How as a man do you know that you're not setting a bad precedence for the future? And what I mean here is Yeah. if I constantly, you know, justify how she's feeling and I and I seek repair and then when she's happy, I just let it go. There's I think sometimes there's a worry as a man that if you just lay down and take everything, then you're just going to get more stuff in the future. Like you're setting a bad precedence for the future of this relationship where no, sometimes actually no, I wasn't in the wrong or oh no, I did I I do disagree with this. Right? And I think I've observed a lot of relationships, especially with some of my guy friends where because they like never stood up for themselves, they're now like living in a prison, right? They like never stood up for themselves. Yes. And so they're they've kind of lost all of their autonomy and agency and control and they, you know, even when you're listening to this, there's probably people you can think of in your life where the guy has always opted for an easy life in the short term and now over the long term, he has a really hard one. Yes. And again, men and women, of course. So this is the balance I'm trying to understand in your view is you know when do you pick the fight and when do you say no that's not versus just laying down and taking it. This is quite per this is quite personal to me as well because I think my dad did that a bit too much. I think my dad, he never he never chose to fight. And then I look I look at how that played out over 20 years and I'm like, damn, it's completely changed me because it means that I will now go through the conflict and stand up for myself when I hit a place where I'm like that I'm not going to be able to honor that for you for the next 30 years. I will stand my ground. Do you know if there's like an area where um we might my say my girlfriend's unhappy about a certain thing I do. Yeah. If I don't think that I'm I'm going to be able to promise to not do that for the next like 10, 20, 30 years, if I if I'm unwilling to change, Yes. I have to stand my ground because if I concede today, it's hell tomorrow. Yeah. What what I'm hearing what I'm hearing is fear of autonomy, fear of my rights, fear of my dominance. Yeah. Like my freedom being Yeah. Well, it's it's you want to hear the probably the number one word you'll hear with relationships that are on the brink. It's caged. Men feels caged. You know, the man feels caged. And really all that is, it's a lack of confidence of knowing if I am willing to do something different, then I can't have anything else. So it's it's it's thinking in terms of zero sum. See, both can be true. I can you can still validate how she's feeling and not at all touch what you still know to be true. So you can still disagree with her, but every time we go into a conversation, we walk in with a need, a need to feel loved, understood, it is always depth. Like you think of um like a kid, right? My son, my daughter, if when she was small and she screamed or she cried or told me no, still tells me no, you know, of all these things and I just said no. Are you kidding me? You're going to tell me and I you're crying right now? Really? And I get all upset when she screams. But with kids, we don't do that. We go she's hungry. She's tired. She's scared. M

### 手机与连接：平衡个人需求与关系舒适

**史蒂芬**举了一个例子：他的前女友想制定一条规则，卧室里永远不能有手机。他意识到，如果他同意了，他可能就根本不会进卧室了，或者会躲到洗手间去处理手机上的事情。他觉得他必须坚持自己的立场，否则未来会让她失望，会为未来的失败埋下伏笔。**杰斐逊**问他当时认为女友的需求是什么。**史蒂芬**认为是**连接**，她把他在卧室里玩手机解读为一种断开连接。**杰斐逊**同意这百分之百可能被这样解读。**史蒂芬**认为这可能不是手机本身的问题，而是他在那周太忙，她试图找到一种方式来表达这种断开连接的感觉。**杰斐逊**强调，他不是说要你妥协，而是说，如果你想要关系的钥匙，那就是**把她的舒适放在你的不便之上**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And we just forget that we're all just big kids and we all have those like hidden needs underneath us and so you still can stand your ground and say so let's run it. So let's say for example an example a specific example from my ex-girlfriend I was on my phone in bed and I was sending a message cuz there's something going on my in my business back in the UK and I was in I was in Asia at the time. Yeah. And she said to me that she wanted to make a rule where there was never any phones in bed ever. I could never touch my phone in the bedroom. Right? And as I thought this through, I thought, God, I thought about all the scenarios where I might need to touch my phone in the bedroom. And what would I I realized that what would end up happening is I just wouldn't come into the bedroom. I'd like go and do it in the in the toilet or the shower or I just like I wouldn't come to bed if I needed to do something on my phone, right? And so the conversation went where I was like I I realized in this moment I had to kind of like not lay down on this issue because I would disappoint her in the future. I was setting myself up to fail in the future if I if I accepted this and made her some kind of promise or you know agreed that we I wasn't going to touch my phone ever again in the bedroom. And so that was one such example where I'm like I think I actually need to stand my ground a bit here or I'm setting myself up for a future expectation I can't meet. So in that moment, what did you think her need was? Her need was connection. And she was interpreting me being on the phone in that space as a disconnection in some way. And could it possibly be perceived as that? 100%. Okay. But it wasn't the phone. It was the it was the it was me not it was her not feeling connected I in my view it at that moment in time in that particular week because I was so busy in that particular week that I think she was trying to find a a symptom or a tool or a guarantee or a promise to express the feeling of disconnection. So that's why I look back on it and go it was actually something else that was just a symptom of a feeling she had at that moment in time probably. Right. But that was an example where like I if id conceded it would have it would not have been sustainable. There would have been arguments in the future. I'm not saying you concede. I'm saying there are times that if you want the key to the relationship, it is putting her comfort over your inconvenience.

### 沟通策略：先验证感受，再寻求解决方案

**杰斐逊**建议，在这种情况下，不要争辩“你总是玩手机”，而是要**放慢节奏**，说：“**我能理解那会让你觉得我没有关注你**。”让她回应，然后你说：“我不想让你觉得我玩手机是在逃避你。”进行这样的对话，然后你可以说：“对我来说，处理这些事情很重要，为了能和你建立连接并放松大脑，我需要处理这些事情。最好的方法是什么？”这样你才能真正进行对话，制定一个合理的计划。因为如果你把自己的不便置于她的舒适之上，她总会不信任你，你的“情感银行账户”也会一直减少。但如果你说你愿意做一些不方便的事情，让她感觉更好、更舒服，那只会增加你的账户，让你们的关系持续更久。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So what should I have done in that situation? Give me some advice. Do you think? Well, you've already kind of named it. one, she's it's not you saying what the wrong thing to say is, "Well, you were just on your phone. I mean, you just I mean, you're on your phone all your time. You're on the phone all the time. What are you talking about?" And you start arguing because now you're you're responding to the reaction. You're not addressing the need. If you were to slow down and say, "Look, I I still want to be connected with you. Is there any kind of place where I can still take care of what I need to take care of?" and also be connected to you. Or if there's a situation where you say, "Well, what about this?" Before I just get my phone and grab it, I'm going to tell you what I'm doing ahead of time or I'm going to ask. Maybe that's where it is. You don't want to ask, "Hey, I Greg is supposed to email me some slides or a deck or whatever. Can I check that out real quick?" You hear how she's probably going to say yes. But the fact that you are saying, "Hey, I'm acknowledging our connection right now." And see, it might make you uncomfortable saying, "No, I don't I don't like anybody telling me what to do. I don't have to I don't want to report to anybody." Okay, that's that's fine. Well, then you just know that connection is always going to be weak. And so, you you're signing your name to that. I don't think I mean there's I have lots of thoughts on phones in houses and where they should go, but if you were to have instead of arguing the what are you talking about? You're on your phone all all the time. And instead said, I can see how that would make you feel like I'm not paying attention to you. And letting her respond to that and you saying, look, I don't want to me being on this. This is not at all me trying to signal that I'm not trying to be here with you. I'm trying to escape on you and have that conversation. And that's where you can say it is important to me that I have these things and for me to be able to connect with you and kind of rest my brain. I need to take care of these things. What's the best way that I can do that? I think then that's when you actually are able to have a conversation of like let's make a g game plan that makes sense because if you you put your inconvenience over her comfort she will always discredit that to you your bank account will always continue to to go low and if but if you say look I I'm willing to do a little bit of inconvenient things to make you feel better make you more comfortable I mean that that only grows your account I mean that that when when you have a relationship that can last a whole lot longer.

### 警惕关系中的“囚禁”：捍卫个人空间

**史蒂芬**坦言，他可能有点**创伤**（Traumatized: 因经历创伤性事件而产生心理困扰和痛苦）了，因为他过去的关系模式让他觉得自己的自由不断被侵蚀，直到几乎失去权力。他见过很多男性朋友就是这样。所以他会反击，有时甚至过度。他认为女友要求卧室里不能有手机是合理的要求，他可以在办公室处理完工作再回卧室。但他之所以会反击，是因为他见过太多男性没有为自己挺身而出，最终被剥夺了权力。他担心如果他现在让步，明天她就会要求厨房里也不能有手机，然后是浴室。所以他觉得，如果他现在就为自己挺身而出，就能阻止这种趋势。**杰斐逊**强调，他绝不是说男人应该对所有要求都言听计从，变得超级被动。那样你会感觉自己一无所有，被掏空。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I think I'm slightly traumatized because um I I think the model that I had of relationships meant that someone can increasingly sort of encroach on your freedom. Yes. Until you are virtually powerless. I think that's a lot of guys. And I've felt that. I've certainly felt that. Yeah. So I I try and fight back and sometimes I think I overdo it. And this is what this is one such example where actually objectively when I hear myself say she asked me not to like be in on my phone in bed. I'm like well it's kind of a reasonable request to be honest. Like the bedroom can be a place where we just like go on the phones. I could just do it in my office and then come to bed when I'm ready. Right. But I think my I get my backup because I've just got so many examples of men who like didn't stand up for themselves. Yes. And then were rendered powerless down the line. So it's like if I give you this then tomorrow you're going to say maybe you can't be on my phone in the kitchen and then maybe I can't be on my phone in the bathroom. And then so I just thought, well, if I just stand up for myself here, then I just hold hold off. What I'm not at all saying is that the guy go, "Yeah, sure. That's fine." And then she asks for something. I go, "Yeah, sure. That's fine." And you just you're super passive with everything. That's where I think you do feel like you're just you look around, you you've given up everything to where you don't feel like I I have anything to to grab on to.

### 捍卫个人爱好：关系吸引力的重要组成部分

**史蒂芬**举了一个例子，很多男性都有和朋友一起的爱好，比如看足球、在群聊里聊天。他认为捍卫这些事情非常重要，甚至对伴侣的吸引力也很重要。他觉得伴侣喜欢他能在某些方面为自己挺身而出，说“不，不，不，这是我的时间，这是为我自己的。”**杰斐逊**表示同意，被动或妥协可能非常没有吸引力，你需要有**骨气**（Backbone: 形容一个人有主见、有原则，不轻易屈服）。同时，你也不能走极端，认为只有你的方式才是唯一的方式。当你选择说“不，不，我愿意在这里坚持立场”时，这传递出一种**力量的信号**，是意志和精神的力量。对**杰斐逊**来说，当你有自己的爱好，那些你真正喜欢的事情时，一个好关系的标志是，伴侣会因为这些爱好让你快乐而感到高兴，即使她可能讨厌它，觉得它很烦人，很奇怪。但如果它让你快乐，并且她知道这是你的空间和时间，因为你需要有那些能充实自己的事情。婚姻本身不足够，孩子不足够，工作不足够。你必须有那些只属于你自己的事情。如果你喜欢去池塘喂鸭子，那就去做吧。你需要充实自己。对于新手父母来说，有一种心态是必须一直和孩子在一起，不能离开孩子。但你会发现，当你真正照顾好自己，去参加男性旅行，或者打一场高尔夫，或者任何能滋养和充实你的事情时，你就能更好地陪伴他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I want to throw in another example that a lot of people relate to. A lot of men have like a hobby with with their guy friends, right? Like watching the football, talking [ __ ] in a group chat. I think it's so important to defend those things. Absolutely. Even for her attraction to you. Like I think I I have no evidence to say that this is true. It's just a feeling. I think to some degree that my partner likes the fact that I'll stand up for myself in certain in certain areas and that I'll say, "No, no, no, no. This is me time. This is for me." I agree. And I can imagine the opposite, the pacivity or kind of rolling over as being a really like unattractive thing. Absolutely. I I think where you are laying yourself down or just rolling over that is that can be very unattractive that it's you need to have a backbone. At the same time, you can't be so extreme that your way is the only way. But when you choose to say, "No, no, this is I'm going to willing to take a stand here." Then that's I think to me it sends a signal of strength, right? Strength of mind, strength of will. But for me, when you have those things that are your hobbies, the things that you really like, a sign of a good relationship is that she's going to be happy, you get to do those because they make you happy. Even though she might hate it and think it's annoying and it's weird and you know, you're taking up that space in the garage and whatever, but if it makes you happy and they know that this is your space and this is your time because I I you have to have those things that fill you up, right? And the truth is the marriage isn't enough. The kids aren't enough. Your job's aren't enough. You have to have things that personally for you by yourself. If your thing is to go to a pond and go feed ducks, go do it. You know, to to be able to fill yourself up. If you if like I I I know for parents, early parents, there's this this mindset of I have to be with my kid all the time. I I can't ever leave my kid. That I need to just be there. But what you find is you'll be so much better when you actually go take care of yourself and go on that guy trip, uh, go play that round of golf or whatever it is that's actually going to feed you and fill you up and then I can be there for you all the more.

</details>

### 设定界限：保护关系中的优先事项

**史蒂芬**指出，有些人的伴侣会尽可能地削减这些个人爱好，以控制对方。我们可能都有这样的朋友，自从进入一段关系后，就好像失去了所有的自由、自主权和能动性，被“牵着绳子”。**杰斐逊**认为这不对劲。这似乎是**没有及早强化界限**（Boundaries: 在人际关系中，指个人为保护自己的空间、情感和需求而设定的规则和限制）的后果，界限似乎是一个滑坡。你做出一次让步，他们就更有可能寻求下一次让步，然后不知不觉你就被“关进牢笼”了。**杰斐逊**认为，这最终归结为“我是否在保护优先事项？”如果我的婚姻是优先事项，我就会设定保护它的界限。无论是工作、写作、演讲还是播客，我都会设定界限来保护我的家庭和关系。所以，你首先要定义什么是优先事项。如果优先事项是你们夫妻希望维持关系，并且知道周四是约会之夜，那么周四就不能安排其他事情。有些事情是不可动摇的，答案就是“不”。当你能坚定地说“不”时，其他所有事情的时间安排就会变得容易得多。但最终，这归结于你是否真实，是否虚伪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I think some people's partners, they don't they're not like that. Some people are in a relationship where their partner cuts out as much of these things as they possibly can. Yeah. So that they can control their partner. I mean, we I think we've all got a friend in a group chat. Oh, yeah. Who has kind of like seems to have lost all their freedom and their autonomy and agency since they've been in that relationship. They'd say they're on a leash. Yeah. They're on a leash. Like they can never come to the thing. Mhm. That's not okay. And it appears to be a consequence of boundaries, like not reinforcing your boundaries early. It appears to me to be a bit of a slippery slope boundaries. Oh, yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like where you like you kind of make a concession and because you've made a concession, they're more likely to pursue another concession, right? And then before you know it, you're behind bars alone. Yeah. And and frustrated and wondering how you how you got here. I know we've spoke about boundaries in the past. To me, it it ultimately comes comes down to am I protecting the priority? So, if I know that my marriage is the priority, I'm going to set boundaries that protect that. I mean, for me in my life right now, whether I'm working on a book or speaking or a podcast or whatever, it's am I setting the boundary up to be protecting my my family in my relationship. So, you have to first define what is the priority here. So if the priority is knowing that we want to be you and your partner want to be in a relationship and you know make sure that Thursday is date night. Okay, that's nothing gets scheduled on date night. There's certain things that just aren't movable. The answer is no. And when you can have those really hard nos, it makes feeling the time of everything else all that much easier. But that's it. I mean it ultimately comes down to are you being real about it? Are you being fake about it?

### “友善”与“仁慈”的区别：真诚是核心

**史蒂芬**问**杰斐逊**关于“友善”（Nice）和“仁慈”（Kind）的区别，以及我们应该追求成为哪种人。**杰斐逊**认为，**停止以牺牲真实为代价的友善**。友善是我们从小就被教导的，比如“要友善，好好玩”。如果你永远相信友善能让你受益，你最终会成为一个**取悦他人者**（People Pleaser: 倾向于牺牲自己的需求和感受来取悦他人的人）。你只会选择说友善的话。友善是非常表面的。如果你和某人约会，我问你约会怎么样，你说“她很友善”。这听起来并不好。但你却想说友善的话。所以，它变得非常注重客套和政治正确。而**仁慈则非常深刻**，它与“亲属”（Kin）这个词有关，它关乎**连接**。所以，友善关注表面，仁慈关注连接。友善的人会说：“哦，我不能告诉他们真相，那不友善。”仁慈的人会说：“我足够关心你，所以要告诉你真相。”所以，当你有机会时，不要选择以牺牲真实为代价的友善，而要选择仁慈。如果你和我在对话中，我本可以说：“是的，伙计，你做的决定听起来很棒，因为我不想让你不高兴，那不友善。”但如果我说：“**史蒂芬**，我必须告诉你，伙计，这对我来说感觉不对。”哪一种是告诉你真实情况的仁慈之举？是真诚。很多人回顾过去，发现自己只是一个取悦他人者，因为他们总是选择友善，而不是仁慈。

In your view, you talk about being nice and being kind. Um, I've heard you talk about this on your podcast. What's the difference between being a nice person and a kind person? And which one should I aspire to be? Stop being nice at the expense of being real. So nice is something that we got taught really early on. Hey, be nice. Play nice. And if you believe forever and always that being nice serves you well, you will ultimately serve it. You will people please. You will only choose to say the nice thing. You will nice is very surface. If you went on a date with somebody and I was like, "How was a date?" And you said, "She was nice." Yuck. Yuck. Yeah. Does does that mean that was good? No. Of course. But you're want to say the nice thing. And so it becomes very much about pleasantries of what's something that that is politically correct or whatever it is. Kind is very deep. It's related to the word kin. It's it's connection. So where nice is concerned about surface, kind is worried about connection. So nice people say, "Oh, I can't tell them the truth. That's that wouldn't be nice. That wouldn't be nice. I can't say that." kind says, "I care about you enough to say the truth." That I I care about you enough to tell you the truth. So when you have the chance, don't choose nice at the expense of being real. Choose the kind thing. Like if you and I were in a conversation and I was like, I could really I could just go, "Yeah, man. That sounds great with the decision you're going to make because I just I don't want to upset you. That that wouldn't be nice." versus me saying, "Stephen, I I have to tell you, man, this doesn't feel right to me." Which one's the kind thing of of telling you the actual truth? It's being authentic to it. So, a lot of people, they they look back and they're just people pleasing. That's all they've they've been because they've always chosen what's nice, not what's kind.

### 取悦他人：童年创伤与自我价值的混淆

**史蒂芬**问，那些取悦他人者想从**杰斐逊**那里得到什么。他们想知道如何停止取悦他人，开始取悦自己。他总是说，取悦他人本身没有问题，只要你自己也是其中之一。为别人做他们要求你做的事情，服务他人，这没有问题。他不是指奴役式的服务，让你永远没有自己的声音。而是指你不断地把自己置于不便的境地，为了别人的利益，希望他们能看到你的真正价值。所以，他们把**取悦他人与自我价值混为一谈**。这意味着，如果你对我不满意，我就对自己毫无意义。如果我不能取悦你，我就对自己毫无意义。你想要这个吗？哦，好的，我去拿。你需要这个吗？让我来做。哦，我已经想到了这个，你喜欢这个。他们忘记了自己的感受。他见过很多人，这很多也与**童年经历**有关。他们从小就学会了，为了挽救父母的婚姻，他们必须成为所有人的所有。他们牺牲了童年，为了取悦所有人。所以，这成为一种**安全模式**，一种生存技能：为了生存，为了有价值，我必须让所有人都满意。

You must get a lot of messages from a lot of people pleasers all the time. And what is it they want from you? They're wanting to know how to stop pleasing other people and to start start pleasing themselves. Like how to I always say that there's not a problem with people pleasing as long as you're one of them. Yeah. Of of it's okay to do things that other people ask you to do and you want to serve other people. I'm not saying it in a as a servitude way of I can never have any of my own voice. It's it's where you constantly are put yourself in inconvenient places for the sake of other people hoping that they will see your true value. So they conflate the pleasure of others with the value of themselves. And so meaning I mean nothing to myself if you're not happy with me. I mean nothing to myself if if I can't please you. you you want this? Oh, okay. I'll go get it. Oh, you need this. Let me do this. Oh, I already thought about this. You love this. And they've forgotten their own sense. And so, I've met people that have, you know, a lot of it's also early childhood, right? They they learned that to save the marriage between mom and dad, they need to be everything to everybody. They have to give up. They they've missed childhood in order to please everybody else. And so it becomes a pattern of safety. It's a survival skill of knowing for me to have to survive in this, for me to have worth, well, I can't do it unless everybody else is happy with me.

**杰斐逊**分享说，他曾对会员进行一项调查，结果显示，即使只读了他书的前三章，**93%的人**在工作和家庭中都受到了显著影响。每个人拿起书都是为了解决心中的某个对话。人们看他的内容，不是为了知道如何处理上次的对话，而是为了知道如何处理下一次。所以，能够提供他们想要的结果是一种福气。他刚写完第三本书，正在用**Adobe Express**（Adobe公司推出的一款在线设计工具）设计封面。他喜欢**Adobe Express**，因为它让他能专注于最小的细节，比如字体、颜色、文本位置，这些看似微不足道，但实际上能创造出脱颖而出、更胜一筹的东西。

### 个人冲突：与妻子塞拉的沟通挑战

**史蒂芬**问**杰斐逊**，在他生活中最难忘的冲突时刻是什么。**杰斐逊**提到他书中写的一个最令人心痛的时刻，是他离开律师事务所，不得不与父亲谈论这件事。但现在对他来说，最新鲜的是他与妻子**塞拉**的对话。他有时很难表达，她也难以理解他，他会变得平静，感到悲伤和懊悔，但又难以表达。所以，他能做的最好的事情就是用言语表达：“你知道，我对发生的事情或我做过的事情感到后悔，我现在可能没有表现出来，但这不是我引以为傲的事情。”至少能用言语表达自己的感受。比如，夫妻之间任何争吵，他们不久前就经历了一次。他们知道要旅行一段时间，有时只有两个人在一起时，就会发生一些小争执，可能是关于最愚蠢的事情。他对她说：“如果我们这样做，那样做，我们可能就不会吵架了，一切都会好起来的。”她却说：“无论如何，都很好。”意思是，如果你不吵架，那很好。但如果吵架了，也很好，因为那是一个**更多了解彼此的机会**。这离不开与你所爱之人**彻底诚实**。

Is there a particular moment of conflict which you stays with you the most when you think about a difficult conversation in your life? Yeah, there was one that I I talk about in my book that was probably the most gut-wrenching at that time was me leaving the the law firm where I was at and having to talk to my dad about leaving that firm. But that's let's say that's in the the book. What's fresh for me now, you want to talk about that? I mean, what's fresh for me now is conversations that I've had with my wife, with Sierra, and I'm having a hard time reaching and she's having a hard time reaching for me, where I kind of just go static where I do feel sad, I do feel remorse, or I I'm trying to and I have a hard time expressing it. So the best thing I can do in that mind is I use my words to be able to say, you know, I I feel regret for what's happened or what I've done and I may not be shown it right now, but I this is not something I'm proud of. To be at least able to show in my words how I'm feeling. So it let's say for example it's about anything related to it could be any argument really with a a husband and a wife or a spouse or partner or whatever it is. But we had one not too long ago where we knew we were going to be traveling for a bit and sometimes if it's just the two of us what's going to happen? You're going to you're going to have some spats. about probably the dumbest things you could probably have a fight about, but that's what what happens. And I said to her, I was like, "Well, that, you know, if we do this and do that, you we'll probably we're not probably going to argue about it. It's going to be fine." And she said to me, she said, "Well, either way, it's good." Meaning, if you don't argue about something, great. But if we do argue about it, that's good, too. to be able to see it as a chance to understand each other a little bit more, to know each other a little bit more. And it's it's it's not without being radically honest um with the person you want to be with.

### 争吵背后的深层原因：情绪化即历史化

**史蒂芬**提到他朋友抱怨妻子准备时间太长，总是迟到。他问**杰斐逊**，这种抱怨是否合理。**杰斐逊**说，在治疗中，他们会说“**如果它歇斯底里，那它就是历史性的**”（If it's hysterical, it's historical: 指如果一个问题引发了强烈的情绪反应，那么它很可能与过去的经历或未解决的创伤有关）。意思是，如果这件事真的那么重要，那么很可能有一些更深层的原因。如果它让你如此困扰，就像那些说“他总是触碰我的底线”的人，我会问“为什么会有底线？”如果它总是让你激动，那么很可能有一些你没有注意到的更深层原因。这可能与他小时候发生的事情有关。

And that's that's hard for a lot of people. I had a friend of mine say to me the other day that the thing that annoys him most about his wife is just like how long she takes to get ready. And he like really like offloaded it to me in a way where I'm like this is a problem for him. Yeah, she just takes so long to get ready and she's like, which means they're always late to things. A lot of guys can relate to this, including myself. But the way he said it to me was was surprising. And I I remember thinking, should he just go and have this conversation with her or is this like an illegitimate concern to raise? And I think there sometimes with, you know, because you were talking about your experience with Sierra and her saying like either way, it's a good thing. Are all arguments warranted? Like is that argument you take too long to get ready and it's pissing me off? Is that a a valid thing to raise with your partner? In therapy, they say if it's hysterical, it's historical. Meaning, if it's really that big of a deal, then there's probably something deeper going on. If it's really affecting you that much, it's like those people who say, "Well, he's always pushing my buttons." I ask, "Why is there a button?" You know, it's if if it's always getting you worked up, there's probably something deeper that you're not noticing. It's probably related to something that happened when he was a kid or something that maybe it's

### 消费习惯与自我价值：童年经历的影响

**杰斐逊**举了一个例子：在他的婚姻中，他是消费型，妻子**塞拉**是节俭型。她能把一分钱变成一毛钱。她曾对他很沮丧，问他为什么总是需要最好的东西。即使他不知道价格标签，他通常也会选择最贵的。这让她很恼火，因为她不会那样做，她会等到打折。她可以非常想要某样东西，但她会在心里一直关注它，直到它打折。这让她感到满足。而他则会直接去买。他不是一个疯狂的消费者，但这个问题一直困扰着他们。后来他们发现，他总是选择好东西的原因，与他小时候作为长子，很少能得到好东西有关。他的东西通常是朋友给的旧物，或者他得不到好东西。在某个时候，你把这与你的**自我价值感**（Self-worth: 一个人对自己价值和能力的整体评价）等同起来。所以，当他第一次有能力为自己支付任何东西时，他会买名牌麦片，买名牌药，因为对他来说，这等同于他希望别人如何看待他。当她意识到这一点时，她明白了这不仅仅是他想挥霍或认为自己必须买最好的，而是这反映了当你给他买好东西时，他觉得你把这与他的价值等同起来。他觉得自己不值得买好东西。这与他的经历有很大关系。他们也同样谈论了她的经历，为什么她不想买东西。所以，就像与朋友进行这些深入的对话一样，为什么她准备时间太长会困扰他？很可能与他过去的一些未被察觉的困扰有关。这些对话值得进行吗？是的，他认为绝对值得。如果它让你如此困扰，那么“**如果它歇斯底里，那它就是历史性的**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

here. Let me give a good example. You know, in in our marriage, I'm the spender. She's the saber. Okay? She she can turn a penny into a dime, right? You can pinch a penny to a dime. And she got really frustrated with me of like, why do you always need the nicest thing, right? And that's typically if she's has an option of several things, even if I don't know the price tags, I typically end up going with the one that's most expensive. And it infuriates her, right? Because she she wouldn't do that. She's going to wait for it to go on sale. It she could have something she really wants and she's just going to track it forever in her mind until it goes on sale. And that's that that gives her satisfaction. Me, I'll just go buy it. And I'm not saying I'm crazy what's I'm not like some crazy spender, but this is an issue that has always bothered her. and bothered me. And what we had come to find out, we had actually used this with my AI actually, but what we had come to learn is that the reason why it affected me so much of like why why do you always choose the the nice thing is related to when I was a kid as the oldest, I I didn't get much of the the nice thing. my my stuff was typically hand me down from a friend or something else or I I didn't get the nice thing. And at some point along the way, you equate that to your sense of worth. And so when I first had the ability to pay for anything for myself, yeah, I I I bought the onbrand cornflakes, you know, I bought the the the onbrand uh medication because to me that that was equal to how I wanted others to perceive me. And so when she realized that, oh, it's not just me wanting to splurge or have some kind of, you know, you just think you um have to buy the best. It was like, no, that's actually it's a reflection of when you buy me something nice, I feel like you equate that to how much value I I hold. I'm not worth buying something nice for. And so it was related a lot to my stuff. And we got to talk the same about her stuff of why she doesn't want to buy the thing. So, it's it's like that having these super conversations with your friend of why does it bother her when she gets takes forever to get dressed? Well, most likely it's related to something in his past that's bothered him that he's not seeing yet. Are the conversation worth having? Yeah, I think it's absolutely worth having. If it's bothering you that much, yeah, if it's hysterical, it's historical.

### 童年创伤与沟通模式：代际循环

**史蒂芬**认为，我们都在与他人的**内在小孩**（Inner Child: 心理学概念，指一个人在童年时期形成的感受、记忆和经历，它们在成年后依然影响着行为和情绪）打交道。我们看起来是成年人，但很多时候我们仍在重演童年时期的故事和叙事。**杰斐逊**表示完全正确。治疗师说，父母最糟糕的事情是他们也有父母。我们很容易只看到父母对我们做了什么，而忘记了他们也有自己的父母，以及他们的父母对他们做了什么。这就是**代际循环**（Generational Cycle: 指家族中代代相传的行为模式、信念或创伤，影响着后代）的定义。我们需要选择与自己的身份、想成为的人以及想如何抚养下一代做出不同的选择。这一切都与生存技能和童年创伤有关。**杰斐逊**的书中有专门一章，让人们定义自己从小看到的沟通技能。因为大多数时候，如果你觉得争吵必须是大声的叫喊，那通常也与文化有关。有些文化中争吵非常激烈，而有些文化和家庭则非常安静。他永远忘不了七岁时去朋友家，他父母在他们吃麦片时大吵大闹，他感到非常震惊和尴尬。而他的朋友却像什么都没发生一样吃着麦片。他的父母吵架时总是在卧室里，关上门，进行他们不想让孩子听到的对话。所以，每个人都被灌输了不同的模式。他见过一些负面例子，人们觉得除非你愿意和我吵架，否则你就不爱我，因为他们从小看到的都是争吵。他们必须说出最伤人的话，必须哭泣，必须对彼此说可怕的话，才能感受到爱。他也见过一些人，他们像**墙头草**（Wallflower: 形容一个人害羞、不合群，在社交场合中不引人注目）一样，什么都不敢说，非常犹豫，因为他们在家里说出真心话时会发生不好的事情。他们意识到说真话对他们不利，他们学会了谎言可以保护他们。

<summary>Original English</summary>

I think that's a really good point which is we're all just dealing with other people's inner child. Like we're all dealing with it's just like me as a child facing you as a child. I know we look like adults now. I haven't got gray hair but yes it's really still us just playing out the stories and narratives from our childhood oftent times. You're exactly right. They they say in therapy the worst thing about parents is that they had parents. you know, I mean, they they it's so easy for me just to look at my mom and me forget that she had parents, you know, that what they did to her rather than me just looking at what my parents have done to me, you know, and and that's the definition of the generational cycle. And it's choosing to do something different with with who you are and who you want to be and who how you want to raise the next generation. But we're it's it's all survival skills. It's all childhood trauma that's related. And when people I have a section in my book of having people define out their own the the communication skills they saw growing up. Because most of the time if you feel like arguments have to be this big shouting match and everybody's yelling and it's it's also typically cultural, you know, of how certain cultures how they argue and how loud it is and if everybody versus there's some cultures and families that it's very quiet. Like I I I'll never forget going to a friend's house when I was about seven and his parents while we're eating cereal like just had at it and I was mortified like arguing arguing arguing and I mean yelling at each other and I am like bowling head mortified and my friend is just eating cereal like hey don't bother him whatsoever it's just another Tuesday you know and whereas I grew up with if my parents argued it was going to be in their bedroom. You know, I knew if they were going to they went to close the door and they were going to have a a conversation that they didn't want us to hear. And so, everybody has been modeled something different where like there's I've seen it on the negative side where people feel like you don't really love me unless you want to fight with me. It's because that's all they've been modeled, fights. They have to say the most hurtful thing. They need to be in tears. They need to be saying horrible things to each other for them to feel any kind of love. And I've also seen it where people are wallflower. They don't want to say anything. They want to be really hesitant because bad things happened when they spoke out at home. They they realized that telling the truth wasn't good for them. They they they learned that lies protected them.

### 沟通中的“假”：三种表现

**史蒂芬**问，我们沟通中的什么会让我们不经意间被人讨厌。**杰斐逊**认为，那听起来很**假**。那么，假是如何表现出来的呢？有三点：第一，他称之为“**闺蜜轰炸**”（Bestie Bombing: 指在刚认识时就表现出过度热情和亲密，试图快速建立深厚友谊的行为）。这与“**爱意轰炸**”（Love Bombing: 指在关系初期通过过度示好、赞美和关注来操纵对方的行为）类似。他经常遇到有人觉得别人对他们很假，因为对方会说：“天哪，我们简直是同一个人！我觉得我们是最好的朋友！”而你们才刚认识。他们会立刻表现出过度的爱意。这不是有安全感的人会做的事，有安全感的人不会立刻与你建立依恋。**史蒂逊**问这是否是一种操纵。**杰斐逊**认为这是一种**不安全感**的表现，因为如果他们真是这个意思，那才是操纵，但他们不是。这些不真实的关系，突然间就说“天哪，我们会成为最好的朋友，我太爱你了！”而你甚至不知道他们的姓氏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's interesting when you have one parent that conducted themselves in a certain way and the other parent was the opposite. Yeah. What then happens to you? Like which communication style you then adopt? Which parent takes more of an interest in you is where it typically goes. The one you're most of the time with. And see, I know people who their parents are kind of absent, but they spend a lot of time with their grandmother. And so I know a guy who he sounds just like his southern grandmother from Kentucky, you know, because that's who he spent most of his time with. And so it's it's who takes the most interest in you. It's it's where the parents what I what I find so interesting in communication we talk everything is learned from how we were raised is at one point in time there was utility to what you were doing. There was a utility to lying. It protected you. Protected maybe your mom. It protected maybe your dad. There's utility to it. There was a utility to manipulating to be able to say things weren't this way in order to keep the family together. So there was a utility to the very skill that you still have and eventually it catches up with you. What is it about our communication do you think that makes us accidentally disliked by other people? It sounds fake. It sounds fake. And how does it sound fake? Give me give me some color. Um, if you want to know the secret if somebody's being fake with you, there's really three things that you got to know. Number one, it's what I call bestie bombing. Bestie bombing. Yeah. So, instead of like love bombing, it's bestie bombing. I have people who come to me all the time of I feel like somebody's being fake with them. And what they're doing is it's, "Oh my gosh, I just we're we're literally the same person. Oh, I think we're best friends." And it's we just met. Like I just we I already talked we're just standing next to each other at the same party and they're like, "Oh, we've got to go. Oh my gosh, we you're my best. You're my soulmate." And it's like they they give way too much right out of the gate of how much they love you. Ah, yeah. And it's it's nothing. It's not what secure people do. Secure people don't attach to you instantly. Is that a form of manipulation? No, it's a form of insecurity. It's it's a form because if it would be manipulation if they actually meant it, but they don't. It's it's these inauthentic relationships that all of a sudden it's like, "Oh my gosh, we we're going to be best friends. I I love you so much." And you're like, I I I'm don't even know I don't even know your last name. What are you What are you talking about? So, you see that a lot.

### 过度赞美与缺乏兴趣：不真诚的信号

第二点是**过度赞美**。我们都有第六感，能分辨真假。没有人需要教你如何分辨假笑。你不需要知道那是不是真的。我们人类都有这种能力，能分辨“那听起来不真实，那不是真正的笑容”。就像照片里的笑容和真实的笑容一样。同样，对于笑声，或者他们过度赞美某事，比如赞美你的鞋子，然后突然转过头去，他们并不是真正投入其中，这只是一种仪式。如果你必须完美地塑造自己，这种完美感让你无法展现真实的自我，你只是在扮演一个角色。所以，这总是非常虚假的。第三点是，那些**不愿真正对你感兴趣的人**。这意味着他们从不问你任何事情，只想谈论自己。你是否曾在一个大型社交场合，有人看着你，然后突然又看向房间里其他人，寻找下一个交谈对象，你就知道你已经失去了他们。你意识到你失去了焦点，他们在寻找下一个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Two is the over compliments. We all have this sixth sense to be able to sniff out if that's real or not. Like nobody needs to teach you if it's a fake laugh or not. You know what I mean? Like Yeah. Right. I don't know. Was that real or not, Stephen? Yeah. Yeah. It's so funny. Yeah. Because we we think we can spot everyone else's fake laugh and then conspars. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. It's like But nobody had to teach that to you. Nobody had to say, "Hey, if you hear like this, it's a fake laugh." No, no, no. We all as humans it's we have an ability a sense to go nah that didn't sound real that's not a real smile you know people have their like photo smile and the real smile and the same with the the the laughter or like that's not that wasn't that funny or they overcomplent something they compliment your shoes I mean and then they have really they go oh my gosh I I I love that outfit and then all of a sudden they've turned their head you know what I mean they're not really truly engaged in what it is it's just it's it's a ritual to them of that's how they have learned because to me if you have to perfectly curate yourself this this sense of perfection you you're not getting the real human you're getting a person in character you're getting them in and scene you know they have to like get into it and so it's it's um it's something that's so so fake every every single time and then I the third that you have to watch out for are the people that aren't willing to actually have an interest in you. Meaning they never ask anything about you. They're only wanting to talk about themselves. Like have you ever been in a I know you have and you're networking in a big room and somebody's looking at you and all of a sudden they're looking at the room like they're they're looking for who they're going to talk to next and you've lost them. And so it's like, why? We're both just kind of here saying things. We're going to slow down our words so it's not as awkward. And you say things like, "Yeah, that's that's crazy." Yeah. And like while you're both looking for somebody else to talk to, but that's what happens. You realize you stay you come out of focus and they they're looking for the next person.

</details>

### 临在感：真诚的最高形式

**史蒂芬**分享了一个令人惊讶的反馈：人们会注意到他如何关注他人。他会收到私信说他们喜欢他如何关注其他人。**杰斐逊**表示，人们一直在观察你对与你交谈的人有多感兴趣。**史蒂芬**以前从未想过这一点，直到收到大约二十条信息说“你知道吗，我注意到你甚至非常关注那个和你说话的人，而不是他们自己。”他觉得这很有趣，我们通过观察别人如何与他人互动来判断一个人。**杰斐逊**认为，**表现出兴趣会让你更受欢迎**。**临在感是真诚的最高形式**。我能和你说话，但我是否真正与你同在？我的目光是否在你身上？我是否对你感兴趣？我是否容易分心？我是否在玩手机？我是否真的在关注？或者我是否确保你是在这一刻最重要的人？即使只有短暂的二三十秒，在见面会上，你是否会问他们的名字？是否会用他们的名字？是否会真诚地看着他们说“谢谢你的到来”？如果没有你，这一切都不会发生。人们一直在观察，他们知道。这就像你感受得到的那种感觉。对他来说，这就是**临在感**。我是否真的与你同在？即使在家里，你可能会说“我一直都在家”，但你是否只是在看手机？是否只是坐在沙发上？是否总是在阅读？那不是临在感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

A really um surprising point of uh feedback or compliment someone gave me once and it's surprising because I never considered it to be something that people were noticing is when I do like meet and greets and you're meeting say 100 people before or after a talk or whatever and they're coming up one one at a time. I will get DMs in the preceding days of people telling me that they liked the way that they watched me pay attention to someone else. Do you get this all the time? Yeah. They're watching how how interested you are in the person that's talking to you. And I didn't I didn't obviously it's not something I'd thought about before until probably had about 20 messages over the last year or two from people saying and do you know what I noticed even how much you were paying attention to the person that spoke to you. Not to them. They were in the line waiting. But it's the per and I just thought that's so interesting that we judge other people by how they interact with other people while we're watching as well. Right. And that being interested is seen as makes you likable. I guess presence is the highest form of authenticity. Like I can talk to you, but am I here with you? Am I do I have my eyes with you? Am I am I interested in you? Am I going to am I easily distracted? Am I have my phone? Am I am I really paying attention? Or am I making sure that you know you are the most important thing that's happening in this moment? Even if it's a glimmer and even if it's for 30, 20 seconds and you're doing a meet and greet and you're saying hi or you're signing their book, do you ask them their name? Do you use their name? Do you look at them with intent of true genuine thank you for being here? None of this would happen if not for you. People are watching the whole time and they they they know. I mean, it's it's it's such a it's like what you know it when you feel it kind of thing. And to me, it's it's presence. Am I am I truly here with you? Okay. Because even at the house, you know, you can say, "Well, I'm home all the time, but are you are you just looking on your phone? Are you just sitting on the couch? Are you always reading? Are you that's not presence?"

### 负面影响的传播：不可原谅的失误

**史蒂芬**播放了一段**麦莉·赛勒斯**（Miley Cyrus: 美国歌手、演员）和**艾米·坎贝尔**（Amy Campbell: 歌手）的病毒视频，她们在见面会上只顾聊天，忽视粉丝。**史蒂芬**认为这与他们刚才说的完全相反。**杰斐逊**觉得这段视频让人看了很痛苦。他认为，对于像**麦莉·赛勒斯**这样级别的名人来说，这种失误几乎是**不可原谅的**。在临在感方面，几乎没有原谅的余地。你要么与他们同在，要么不在，因为这种事情可以持续很久。其次，人们会忘记你做了什么，但永远不会忘记你让他们感觉如何。人们会记住**史蒂芬**，告诉他们的孩子和孙子，他们遇到**史蒂芬**时，他多么友善，多么专注，多么真诚地对他们感兴趣。这会带来巨大的不同。如果你犯了一个错误，那是不太容易被原谅的。一个失误会被放大，因为如果你能对他们那样做，你也能对我那样做。这个失误会传播得更远，更快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I'm going to play this video on the screen for anyone that's uh watching the video. Okay. But it it immediately made me think of um this clip that went viral of Miley Cyrus and Amy Campbell. Oh, I haven't seen this. They were doing a meet and greet together and they were just chatting to each other and kind of ignoring the fans. And you can be I just remember thinking this is like the antithesis of what we've just said. It's painful to watch. I know it's painful for the people. I mean I it's several layers of where one, it's an area of really little forgiveness. You know, if you think of somebody of of her caliber, so to say, of like her celebrity, right? Seen thousands, millions, it's happened. And is there really room for just having a conversation with somebody like if I if you're her, how do you what would be the justification? Right? If you could just pause and say, "What is it?" Maybe you say, "Well, there isn't any." Okay, that's fine. But let's say one, when it comes to presence, there's really not any room for forgiveness. It's it's either you're present with them or you're you're not because this kind of thing can last forever. Second of all, people will forget what you did, but they'll never forget how you made them feel. And people will remember you, Stephen, of they will tell their kids and their grandkids of the time that they met you and how nice you were, how present you were, and how you were genuinely interested in them. And that makes all the difference. If you have one slip up, that's when I say it's it's it's not very forgivable. When when you have one slip up, it's showing applied to all because if you can do it to them, you can do it to me. The slip up will also travel much further. Faster too. Yeah. Faster. F

### 谦逊与领导力：关注微小之处

**杰斐逊**认为，一个像**麦莉·赛勒斯**这样的人，即使只犯一次错误，一次疲惫，也会传播得更快。这就是为什么他说**临在感是真诚的最高形式**。如果你能花那一刻真正对某人感兴趣，因为你只是一个小镇来的，在车里拍视频的人，而他们却为了你的签售会，飞行了两小时前来。你为什么不花三分钟和他们聊聊呢？当你拥有那种**谦逊**（Humility: 谦虚，不自大，认识到自己的局限性）时，很多人会忘记他们是如何获得成功的。**史蒂芬**分享了一个有趣的例子：他们公司任命了一位新董事长**尼基**（Nikki）。**尼基**在**宝洁公司**（Procter & Gamble: 跨国消费品公司）工作了12年，又在**波士顿咨询集团**（Boston Consulting Group: 全球知名的管理咨询公司）担任高级职位25年。他已经取得了巨大的成就。但他加入公司后，与数百名员工中的每一个人都坐下来聊了一个小时，无论他们是实习生还是首席执行官。这让**史蒂芬**印象深刻，**尼基**仅仅通过给予他人最宝贵的东西——**时间**，就极大地塑造了人们对他的看法。

because I guarantee you, you know, you think of all the meet and greets that somebody like that has had and has had genuine real interest. They they mess up one time, they get tired one time. Well, then all of a sudden that's what travels way faster. So, but the thing is that that's why I say presence is the highest form of authenticity because if you can take that moment to be truly interested in somebody because who am I? You know, I'm I'm a guy from a small town who made videos in my car and you're going to come to my book signing and you traveled and you flew in two hours. Like, why would I not? Hold up. Take the line. Let me spend three minutes with you. Can I give three minutes of my life to talk to you? What are you doing here? And so when you have that humility and there's several people I know you know many names of they they forgot how they got what they got. Oh yeah. I have a really interesting example of this recently where we appointed a new chairman to our company. He's called Nikki and um incredible guy. He's been at like he'd been proctor and gamble doing product for I don't know 12 years. then went to Boston Consulting Group and was one of the senior figures at Boston Consulting Group for 25 years. And you know, he's in the the home stretch of his career. Mhm. And he joined our company and he is, you know, he he's achieved so much. He's he's worked with the biggest the best in the world globally, right? So, he's got the right, one would say, I like that, to be a certain way. That's what someone might say. But I'm over here in Los Angeles. Um, he joins the company as chairman. And the interesting thing, the interesting feedback I got, I know 5,000 miles away was a very junior member of the team came up to me and said, "Oh, I love Nikki." And I was like, "Explain." And he went, he sat down with me and gave me an hour of his time. That was the reason he loved him. That was it. It was presence. and and what what I I later found out was that Nikki went into the company and there is hundreds of people and he sat down with every single one of them regardless of whether you're an intern or whether you're the CEO and it always it's always stayed with me how much that has mattered how much that has shaped his perception just disproport he's brilliant and everything but disproportionately shaped his perception just by giving someone the most valuable thing which is just their time.

### 观察他人互动：间接判断与“荒谬的捷径”

**杰斐逊**认为，当你习惯于付出时，付出也会让你感觉像在接受。当你付出时间时，你也会感觉像在收回时间。当你能持续保持这种精神和谦逊的认知时，你会意识到自己和别人一样奇怪和糟糕。你并不比任何人优越。当你拥有这种心态，想要与每一个人见面和接触时，如果你只和最受欢迎的人说话，而不和那些不那么受欢迎的人说话，你会得到什么？你会得到更多。当你能放低姿态说“嘿，我们都只是房间里的人，过得怎么样？”时，你会得到更多。**史蒂芬**指出，我们通过**间接观察**（Vicariously: 通过观察他人而非亲身经历来感受或学习）他人如何互动来了解他们。当你走进房间时，你不仅和**史蒂芬**说话，还问了今天录制播客的**伯塔**（Berta）的名字，并感谢她所做的一切。**史蒂芬**记得这件事，因为它非常令人难忘。不是每个人都会这样做，不是每个人都会注意到**伯塔**在房间里操作着所有摄像机。但你在录制前特意问了她的名字，并感谢她。大多数人不会这样做。当你离开时，**史蒂芬**不会记住你说了他什么好话，最令人震惊、最难忘、最不寻常、最容易被忽视的事情是**你认可了其他人**。

Yes. And um I mean maybe it's a a story of how to be a good partner. Maybe it's a story of how to be in the public eye, right? Maybe it's also a story of how to be a great colleague or team member or leader. Yeah. Or just a great human. Yeah. I I think there is um when you're always in the habit of giving, giving then feels a lot like receiving. So when I'm giving my time, it also feels like I'm receiving that time back. when I can continually have that spirit and you have that knowledge of humility. They say, "What does humility mean?" It it means you realize that you are just as weird and terrible as everybody else. When you realize I I'm I'm the chief worst person there is. No, I'm not better than a single person that is in line to to do or attend something or sit in an audience. I I am no better. I've just been through a lot. Still been through a lot. And so I know a lot. And when you have that mindset of I want to meet and touch every single person. If I were to come in here and only talk to you, but not talk to your team, what's what do you think that's going to do when you can go somewhere and not just talk to who's the most popular, but also talk to who's the least? Like it's it is you will always get way more. and for yourself and for the other person when you can lower yourself to say, "Hey, we're just humans in a room. How's it going?" It's interesting that we um we're figuring people out by how we observe them vicariously. We were talking about it in the context of like a meet and greet a second ago. Yeah. What you said there tracks perfectly with with that, which is when you walked in the room, you didn't just speak to me, you also asked Berta, who's recording the podcast today, what her name was. And then you said to Berta, you said, "Thank you for doing this." right now. Isn't it funny that I remember? Yeah. Yeah. Isn't it funny that that was like two and a half hours ago and I remember because it was really memorable to me that you did that because not everybody does that. Not everybody will, you know, notice that B is in the room with us and she's running all these cameras and she's putting it together. But for some reason, just before we started recording, you made a point of asking her what her name was and then and then thanking her for doing this today. Yeah. Most people don't do that. And as you walk away from today, I'm not going to remember like that you you walked in and said something nice about me or whatever. The most shocking thing and therefore the most memorable because it is the most unusual because it is typically the most overlooked is you acknowledging the other people.

### 微小互动：定义人际体验的“荒谬”捷径

**史蒂芬**提出了一个**悖论**（Paradox: 表面上自相矛盾，但实际上可能包含深层真理的说法）：无用的荒谬比有用的实用更能定义你。他举例说，如果他回家告诉女友健身房很棒，有一个100英尺高的攀岩墙，他是在指出最荒谬的事情，以此作为**捷径**（Shortcut: 达到目的的更直接或更快速的方法），让她了解整个健身房。如果你说有一个100英尺高的攀岩墙，你就知道那里有很多跑步机。所以，当他离开时说“他很好，他甚至和**伯塔**说话，感谢她录制播客”，他是在用这个作为捷径，因为这是最突出、最荒谬的事情，能告诉别人关于你的一切。**杰斐逊**非常喜欢这个观点。这就是为什么我们应该重视那些看似微不足道、无关紧要的小事，因为别人不重视，所以它能产生**最大的影响**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And um I've noticed this as a paradox that I almost need to put words to, but I I remember in something I wrote a long time ago saying how useless absurdity will define you more than useful practicality. And what I mean by that is the example I was giving was in the context of my old gym where they have this massive climbing wall in the entrance. And I came home to my girlfriend and said, "There's this incredible gym. It's massive. They even have a 100 foot climbing wall in the entrance." What I'm doing is I'm pointing at the most absurd thing to give you a shortcut that tells you everything about that gym. Now, if I point at the most absurd thing, you know the gym is big. Oh, I got chills. Yeah. Yeah. So good. Yes. If I say there's 100 foot climbing wall, you know, there's lots of running machines, right? So, if I if I when I leave here and go, he was so nice. He even spoke to Ber and um thanked her for doing the podcast. I'm using that as a shortcut because it's the most standout absurd thing to tell other people everything about you. Yes. I love that. And this is why we should value the the seemingly petty and seemingly small and seemingly inconsequential because other people don't. Therefore, it creates maximal impact.

### 小对话的重要性：涟漪效应

**杰斐逊**认为，这就是为什么大对话很少重要，而**小对话才重要**。是与陌生人的小对话，不是在舞台上的对话，而是在车道上、后院、咖啡店里的对话，是在电梯里与擦肩而过的人的对话。正是这些定义了人类的体验。如果你发短信赞美我，那是一回事。但如果我说：“嘿，我刚和你也认识的某某吃完午饭。我必须告诉你，这个人非常喜欢你。”然后我分享他们对你说了什么，你会有不同的感受。如果你想送我一份礼物，但他们没有给我，而是给了我的孩子，这更能体现他们有多关心。每次他上台，他都会优先认识负责音视频系统、麦克风等所有设备的工作人员的名字。他想知道他们今天做了多少次，他们过得怎么样，因为很容易只顾着和重要人物说话，而假装他们只是在做自己的工作。当你能真正与普通人交谈，忘记你不需要只关注那些“大人物”时，你就会得到更多。他以前常说，我们都有**无形公关**（Invisible PR: 指一个人在日常生活中通过微小、不经意的行为所建立的声誉和形象，这些行为往往被他人观察和传播）。它在最重要的时刻显现，但却是在最不重要的时刻建立起来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yes. That that's why the big conversations rarely matter. the small ones do. It's the small ones with strangers. It's the conversations you don't have on the stage. It's the conversations you have in your driveway. It's the conversations you have in your backyard at the coffee shop. It's it's the conversations you have to somebody passing by in the elevator. Like, it's those that that's what defines the human experience. If I were to text you a compliment, right? That's one thing. But if I were to say, "Hey, I just finished lunch with soand so who you also know. I got to tell you, this person loves you so much and and I share with you what they said about you, you're going to take that differently. If I wanted to give you, let's say if someone want to give me a gift, right? But instead, they didn't give it to me, they gave it to my kids. I mean, that's h how much more would that define how much they care, right? It it's anytime I go on a a stage, I make it a priority that I know the guy who's or girl who's putting on my the AV system, the lapel mic, the everything. I want to know their name. I know how how many times they've done this today, how they're doing because it's so easy just to turn and keep talking to who's important while and act like they're just doing it. Like it's when you can truly talk to the people that's just a regular person and forget that you you don't have to just stick to the somebodyodies. You don't have to look always for the somebodyodies. I used to say that I again this comes from employing a lot of people that we all have invisible PR and it's and it shows up in the moments that matters the most but it's built in the moments that seem to matter the least.

### 言语的力量：积极与消极的深远影响

**史蒂芬**回忆起在纽约办公室工作时，他的团队成员发来消息说“**珍妮**真好，**蒂姆**摔倒了，**珍妮**立刻从办公桌前跑过去拿急救箱帮他处理。她真好。”一年后，在**珍妮**的晋升谈话中，**史蒂芬**会想起她做的这件小事，并认为她是一个值得加倍投资的人。反之亦然，如果有人对一个不那么重要的人做了一件小事，也会产生负面影响。他曾与一位名人交谈，对方非常粗鲁，这让他印象深刻。**杰斐逊**认为，这就像我们刚才说的，那些微小的连接、临在感和真实性，会让你永远记住。他敢打赌，**史蒂芬**小时候在操场上，或者老师，或者生命中的某个人说了一些好话，你永远记住了。但他也敢打赌，你也会记得有人说了伤人的话，或者粗鲁的话，或者评论了你的外表。那个人在不知不觉中给了你一生的不安全感。所以，积极的事情会被记住，但**消极的事情会被记住更久，传播得更远**。你的言语力量远超你的想象。涟漪效应会影响你从未见过的人。你如何与收银员交谈，会影响他或她回家后如何与孩子交谈。如果你粗鲁或不耐烦，因为他们不够快，那么在不知不觉中，就像积极的影响一样，消极的影响也会持续下去。你选择说的话，要为他们如何对待自己的孩子负责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And the example I always think of is being working in the New York office um many years ago and getting a message from my team member just saying, "Oh, Jenny's so nice. She just Tim tripped over and Jenny immediately got up from her desk and ran across uh to the first aid kit and sorted him out. She's so nice." And I'd hear that 3,000 miles away. And then a year later, I'd be sat with Jenny during her promotion conversation. Yeah. And that one thing she did, that small thing she did was often the time where I'd go, you know what, this person is a certain type of person and we should double down on them. And then I've got the opposite as well. I've got the a little thing someone did to someone who was not necessarily their line manager or significant. Yeah. And it, you know, and even things that happened to me years ago when I came up to I walked up to someone famous. I've told this story. It's so crazy. I told this story on the podcast like episode three and no one listened and then um like 3 four years later the podcast got bigger and people started listening to people go back to the old episodes. Mhm. And this famous person tweeted me like four years later I was like I heard you're talking about me in the UK blah blah blah blah blah. But I was I was just sharing as an example for like invisible PR where someone I'd gone up to someone famous and asked them a question and they just like bang. Yeah. Like laid into me. Right. And I and I, you know, I don't know what they're going through that day, but it it always, you know, well, that's but that brings it around like full circle because like we just said, you can have those little moments where it's it's the rock wall, right? Where little moments of connection, of presence, of real authenticity, of them being with you that you'll remember forever. And I bet if I had to guess, there's a moment in Steven at the playground growing up that or a teacher, somebody in your life said something that was nice and you've remembered forever. Oh, yeah. But I would also venture a bit. Yes. Before you've even said, I could I thought of the moment that Okay. Playground Steven where somebody said something hurtful. Yeah. Or rude or said something about how you look or your appearance. Maybe not even recess, but sometime in your life. Oh yeah. And it was just something maybe it was about for a lot of people it's like their weight or their appearance or their looks and they've carried that around with them forever and that like without knowing it that person gave you an insecurity for the rest of your life. And so it's so wild to me how the positive is remembered, the negative is remembered much longer and travels a lot farther. And I mean it's when I ask that to a group that I'm talking to, those hands are always way more raised for the negative, for the one thing that the power of your words lasts way longer than you'd ever think. The ripple effect will affect people you've never met. I mean, you think think of the people who you've touched and the people you've never met, but yet they have a perception of you based three persons down, right? And how I talk to my kids will affect how they talk to their kids and their kids. Children I'll never meet. And when you realize that how I talk to the person behind the cashier affects how he or she talks to their kids when they go home based on what I said will determine whether they come home and say, "I had a really bad day. I had a really hard day and it it's because of what I said because I was rude or I was impatient because they didn't get it to me fast enough and all of a sudden without knowing just as much as the positive lasts so does the negative. It's now I what I chose to say is responsible for how they're treating their own kids.

### 沟通的最终目标：自我价值

我们人类之所以能生存下来，是因为我们擅长**八卦**（Gossip: 传播关于他人私人或不经证实信息的行为），擅长传递故事。所以，这在某种程度上是一种生存适应。我们总是问“有什么新闻？”**史蒂芬**请**杰斐逊**总结成为沟通大师的五点，以获得生活中想要的一切。他认为沟通的最终目标是**自我价值**：我是否足够好？**杰斐逊**同意，沟通的最终目标是**自我价值**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And that's what how we are as humans, right? Like we um the reason why we survived is because we're good at gossip. That too. We're good at passing on stories. So, you know, I could tell people before they met you if you were a risk. No. Yeah. I could, you know, don't go near him. Don't go near that cave. There's a threat person in there that's going to kill us. So, right. It's a survival adaptation, I guess, in some respects to be gossipy and to pass on people's reputations. But we've always asked what's the news? You know, people going through town from town to town. You you didn't you didn't really have a paper. It's do you have any news? So, I'm going to push you to close to give me the five things that you think are most important for anyone who's striving to be a masterful communicator, conversationalist to get what they want out of life, which is really what I think is it is the last domino when we talk about body language or communication tactics or all the things we're talking about. I think people are trying to get something out of life, whether it's to have a better relationship or to be respected or what, get a promotion, to be successful. I think that's probably the the output we're looking for ultimately. Do you agree with that? I don't want to like what is it that what's the last domino that people are looking for when they talk about this stuff up here? Selfworth. Selfworth. Okay. Am I Am I enough? Am I enough? Okay. So what are the what are the five most important things to summarize if you had to give me five.

### 沟通五大要点：真诚、减少干扰、停止过度解释

**杰斐逊**总结了成为沟通大师的五大要点：
1.  **真诚**：如果你不能真诚地对待我，那么你对我来说就什么都不是。即使在糟糕的一天，你是否仍然在工作中保持真诚？是的。当然，在社会规范之内，即使我心情不好，也不能随意发脾气。但你肯定有空间说，不要假装快乐，当你并不快乐的时候。撒谎是否违反了真诚？如果同事问你对她的新发型有什么看法，你觉得很糟糕，你会怎么说？**杰斐逊**可能会说：“这是一个有趣的选择。”他不会撒谎，他会说他很高兴她喜欢。你喜欢它，那很棒。**真诚作为一种策略，会随着时间建立信任**。最近的研究表明，在社交场合中，那些更真诚的人也更值得信任，更受人欢迎。人们为什么难以保持真诚？这又回到了取悦他人这一点。他们从小在不安全的环境中长大，无论是身体上还是情感上。所以他们总是紧张、焦虑，担心接下来会发生什么，无法放松。
2.  **减少干扰**：这与增加临在感是同一个意思。如果你想增加临在感，就必须消除干扰，这意味着要减少玩手机的频率。**杰斐逊**用一根红线来代表两人之间的连接。当他拿出手机时，连接就会松弛，让人感到不尊重。即使你把手机面朝下放在桌上，你的世界、你的业务、你的压力、你的混乱仍然存在，它就像你的安慰奶嘴。所以，即使你把它放下，或者放在口袋里，连接的强度也会受到影响。如果你想成为一个更好的沟通者，你必须理解**真正连接的定义：保持紧密**。当他去餐厅时，看到很多夫妻、朋友都在玩手机，这让他感到震惊。手机已经成为一种情感安慰剂，让我们避免独处时的焦虑。
3.  **停止过度解释**：如果你总是滔滔不绝，人们是更想听你说话还是更不想听？会更不想听。信息会淹没在过多的言语中。如果你总是说很多话，人们很容易就会忽略你，这本身就成了一种干扰。但如果你选择用词，放慢语速，如何阻止自己过度解释？**不要做瀑布，而要做一口井**。这意味着不要试图倾泻信息，让别人被你的信息冲走，而是要自信地掌握你的知识。如果他们有问题，他们会问。当他们问问题时，花点时间思考。有些人在被问到问题时，会说“让我思考一下”。当你这样做时，人们会立刻更认真地对待你的回答。而很多人则相反，一旦被问到问题，就会滔滔不绝，边说边想。**杰斐逊**教导说，**你的第一个词应该是你的呼吸**。当你把呼吸放在第一个词的位置时，一切都会流畅。如果你滔滔不绝，你传递的信号是“我不知道”。大多数人都是边说边想。但如果你被问到一个很难的问题，你没有立刻做出反应，而是说“好问题，让我思考一下”，那么人们就会知道你即将说出的内容是经过深思熟虑的，是他们想听的。他们会更好奇，屏息以待。在商务会议中，那些自信的人不必通过说话来显示他们知道什么，他们会选择合适的时机。

The first is authenticity. If I cannot be genuine with you, if I cannot be real with you, then I can be nobody to you. And on authenticity, you know, on your bad day, are you still authentic at work? Yes. Like if you're if you're really, you know, having a bad day, do you show up to work as your authentic self? I would say yes. I mean, there's obviously certain parameters that are within social norms of just because I'm having a a bad time and in a bad mood, does that give me a right to rip you a new one? Uh, just because you said hello to me that morning, you know? No. But I I think that there is certainly a space to say, don't act h like you're happy when you're not. What about lying? Is that a violation of authenticity? So, a colleague comes up to me, they say, "What do you think of my new haircut?" And you think it's terrible? Yeah. What you What' you say? It's an interesting choice. Probably is what I'd say. So, you wouldn't lie. No, I wouldn't. I would probably change it to where it's I'm glad that they like it. You know, I I don't have to like it for you to give it any type of worth. If you like it, that's awesome. And authenticity as a strategy builds trust over time. So, that's a long-term game, I guess. Yeah. No, I I came across some research uh recently where it was in social settings, those that are more authentic are also the ones that are more trusted and the ones you want to be around more. Why do people struggle with authenticity? It goes back to this point about people pleasing, I guess. But there is a certain type of person, I think, that probably struggles to just be, you know, just to show up in all the ways that they they are to be themselves. They grew up in places that weren't safe, whether physically or emotionally. They they grew up unsafe. And so they're always tense. They're always anxious. They're always worried about the next shoe to drop. They can't rest. You see people that had come from very hard, harsh environments. you'll see the survival skills that have come out of that. Um, it's because they they simply didn't have a place to be safe. Number two, reduce the amount of distraction. Reduce distraction. Is that the same as saying like increase presence? Well, that is the the benefit of it. Yeah. If you want to increase your presence, you have to eliminate distractions. And that means eliminate how often you're on your phone. I've got some thread here. Do you know why this is here? Yes. Well, you explain. Well, I mean, so just a piece of very pretty red string. And this string is going to represent the connection between the two of us. So, give you the end of it. What I just gave you is a piece of string. And it connects between your hand and my hand. And it's taught right now. So this string right now represents the connection between us in conversation. It's tight. It's very tight. I'm going to ask questions throughout this that don't think about how what the right answer is. Just go with what your gut instinct of how it feels. So right now it's tight. And if I look at you in the eye and I say, "Stephen, how's it going, man?" It's going good. Yeah. Yeah. What was something that frustrated you yesterday? My haircut didn't go to plan. Tell me about it. It's just not It's not good. I don't like it. Do you find that some of the the biggest struggles you had yesterday was mostly with business or personal or Tell me something with business. Um the struggles with business yesterday. Yeah. Oh, go ahead. Okay. So, you're on your phone now and the connection has been reduced. Um Yeah. So, I just pulled out my phone and now I'm looking. And what did you feel in the line? I felt like the tightness went it went loose. Yeah, it went slack. Right. And but that's the physical. What was emotionally? How did that feel? It felt disrespectful. Yeah. And see if I had just both had both hands on it like this. Now let's put it taught again and I'm talking to you and I say, "So what's what are you looking forward to this weekend?" I'm looking forward to No, go ahead. And this is me just turn. It's still tight. Don't worry. It's I still am connected to you, you know. Don't worry about it. I'm I'm right here. Go ahead. Yeah. Exactly. You see how all of a sudden you wanted to let go now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For anybody listening. So you we both had it tight. I look at my phone while still holding it tight where I'm saying, "No, no, I'm listening. Go right ahead." And all of a sudden, you are the one that let go of the line. Yeah. Isn't that something? Because all of a sudden, you gave up on the conversation. You didn't want to be in it anymore. What do you typically do if somebody's at dinner with you and they pull out their phone? I mean, you look away or you can speak to someone else or you or you pull out your phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You It's like they've given you permission to now pick up their phone. Somebody gets on theirs and you don't want to look awkward or odd. So, what you you get out yours and next thing you know, both of you are on your phones at dinner where you're supposed to be communicating with each other and you're just staring at your phone. Do you think I sometimes think this with me being an interviewer having this iPad in front of me, I'm like, should I get rid of the iPad? Maybe I should because I write things down while someone's speaking to me and I I do worry sometimes that if I'm like looking at a particular point or fact or whatever that I'm It's a little bit different. So, there's a part of this that is it's it's a production. We have cameras. We have lights. Like, this isn't a normal just if you and I were having coffee. But let's say you and I were having lunch and I'm talking like this to you and I put my phone right here. Do you feel a difference? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Do you feel I'm more connected or less connected? Less connected. Yeah. And if I am mixed priorities, not the priority. Do you feel any different if I flip it over? Yes, I do. And my face is it's it's down. Yes, I do. It's a signal of that you think this is more important and you don't want to be distracted. Imagine what would you feel like if you were on a date or got together with a friend and you just said, "Hey, where's your phone?" He said, "Oh, I just left it in the car. I just wanted to sit with you." Yes. Incredible. Does anybody do that? No. No. Nobody does that. But imagine imagine if right now there was uh let's say a woman is about to go on a date and she asked a guy, "Where's your phone?" And he goes, "Oh, I left it in the left it in the car." I mean, what kind of You think it was kind of weird? Yeah. Almost like what? You mean you want to be solely interested in me? I'm signaling that there is nothing else more important than what's going on right here. So, that's so such atypical behavior. Some people might see it as a red flag. I No, that's probably true. But if I have it here, even if I put it face down on the table and I'm talking to you, I'm at least still having my world, my business, my stress, my chaos. It's my It's my pacifier. You don't you're not going to ask me to take away my blanket, are you? Yeah. And so I'm still it's still there in the conversation with us. So even if I put it down or I put it between my legs or I put it in my pocket, which I think is much better of not letting it come out at all, but it's what's the strength of the connection? Because we've all been that person like we just showed with the string where they get out their phone while you're talking and like Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Go ahead. And you go, I don't want this. Yeah. you let go because it's like that's this isn't real this isn't real connection. So if you want to be a better communicator, you have to understand the definition of true connection. It's keeping it taught. I am so shocked when I go to restaurants with my girlfriend cuz we have a rule and this is actually a rule that I completely agreed with. Yeah. Which is like when we go on a date or we go to a restaurant, there's no phones. Exactly. We're not going to be on our phones in a restaurant. It's mind-blowing. Mindblowing. We went to um when we were we've been here all this week and and we went to a restaurant Sier and I and I saw so many couples and people and friends and that were just at the table and it it was it was dark evening and all you see is the glow of phones just everybody just sitting there on their phone. It's just it's it's crazy to me. or or the people that are on their couch with the TV on both of them are on their phones and and they're supposed to be watching a movie together. You know, everyone people watches a little bit and restaurants. Yeah. So, I'm not going to pretend we don't. Yeah. At least I'm not going to do that. I'm But we we will be in a restaurant and we just sometimes play a little game where we kind of guess how long people have been together based on how they're behaving. Oh, I like that. Yeah, that's fun. And so it's it tends to be the case that it's the younger couples where there's a man and a woman and they're both on their phone and I just can't believe what I'm seeing. Yeah. Like I'm look I got my phone a lot but if I'm on a date I am not going to be sat there looking at a screen while she's sat there looking on a screen just in total silence. Even if I've known this woman for 35 years. Yeah. It's become so much of a an emotional pacifier when I don't like the angst of having to wait in line by myself. I don't like having to sit on the the subway or the tube or the metro or whatever by myself. I I get out I get out my phone. I don't it it prevents me from having to have dialogue. So instead, I'd rather just look at my phone and watch and scroll versus communicating. Like there's imagine waiting for your haircut and everybody in the room is actually talking to one another like they used to and it would just be wild to you. Everybody in a doctor's office in the waiting room everybody's looking at their phone. So yeah, to me it's such a distraction and that means even at the house too I think even more so when it comes to the house. So that was point number two which was reducing um distractions and the first was authenticity. Number four, know how to deal with their sadness.

### 沟通五大要点：处理悲伤、应对侮辱

4.  **懂得如何处理他人的悲伤**：很多人正在经历痛苦和悲伤，但你却不知道。如果你想成为一个顶级的沟通者，你不仅要在顺境时懂得如何说话，也要在逆境时懂得。当有人悲伤时，不要说“告诉我你需要什么”。你只是在给他们增加一项任务。他们已经在悲伤中，你却让他们自己去想办法告诉你需求。这永远不会发生。你是否曾遇到过有人说“告诉我你需要什么”，然后他们真的告诉了你？从没有。因为你把责任推给了他们。你只是给了他们一个义务，一个负担。他们甚至不想活在这些时刻。所以，不要说“告诉我你需要什么”，而是**直接去做**。如果你想给他们送晚餐，就直接送去。去跑腿，帮他们洗衣服，帮他们修剪草坪。如果你真的想帮助他们，就直接去做，不要问。其次，当有人悲伤时，很多人不知道该说什么。他们觉得不舒服，觉得说什么都不够。最好的办法是**验证他们的感受**。没有人应该经历这些，这太不公平了。我不敢相信这发生了。没有人应该承受这些。表达并确认他们的感受是完全正常的。不要说“至少他们去了更好的地方”，或者“一切发生都是有原因的”。现在不是说这些话的时候。不要试图让他们感觉好一点。如果你真的关心，就给他们发短信，告诉他们你在为他们祈祷。不要只是在Facebook评论里说“在我们的祈祷中”，那不是连接，也不真诚。**史蒂芬**提到他曾为**萨米尔·乔杜里**（Samir Chaudry: YouTube频道“Colin and Samir”的联合创始人）的房子被烧毁而发去了一条具体的信息，**萨米尔**六个月后还记得，并感谢他发送了具体的信息。这说明当你停止追求便利，而开始做一些稍微不舒服、需要多一点努力的事情时，选择做一些不同的、更具体的事情，而不是只说“听到这个很难过”，那会产生巨大的影响。越具体，就越真诚。
5.  **懂得如何应对侮辱、贬低和傲慢**：如果你想应对那些试图用言语伤害你的人，首先要做的就是**保持沉默**，五到七秒的沉默。让这种沉默持续到让他们感到不舒服，让他们知道这不好玩。其次，**让他们重复**。我需要你再说一遍。大多数人做不到。第三，如果需要，问他们：“你是不是故意让它听起来很粗鲁？你是不是故意让它听起来很伤人？”这能让你以一种不让他们的言语伤害你的方式行事。当有人说一些贬低或侮辱你的话时，他们是在把聚光灯打在自己身上，并希望把它扔给你，以获得你的反应。所以，他们会说一些伤人的话，然后把聚光灯转向你。当你问问题，当你保持沉默时，他们的言语就会回荡到他们自己身上。很多人甚至在你说任何话之前，就会说“我不该说那句话”。沉默越多，就越尴尬，他们就不得不收回。他们意识到你没有上钩。但当你把聚光灯打回去，问他们“你是不是故意让我难堪？你是不是故意让它听起来很伤人？”他们无法忍受说“是”的想法。所以他们必须修正它，他们会说“哦，不，不，不，我的意思是……”然后他们会换一种说法。如果他们坚持说“是的，我就是这个意思”，你就可以说“谢谢你告诉我。”

Number four, know how to deal with their sadness. A lot of people are hurting that you don't know are hurting. And a lot of people are grieving that you don't know are grieving. Whether it's the holidays, whether it's a an important date or event that you don't know about in their life and they're hurting and grieving. If you really want to be a top level communicator, you need to know not to say not only when the times are good, but also when the times are are bad. And how does how does one be there for someone when they're going through their moments of sadness? Is there any principles that one should think about? Yeah. But when somebody is grieving, what you do not do is begin with let me know if if you if if what you are about to say begins with let me know if it's the wrong thing to say. Let me know if you need anything. Let me know if I can do anything for you. Hey, just just let me know. Anything you need, let me know. All you're doing is giving them a chore. This person's already grieving at this moment. They It's They're going through something you don't even know how to feel and you're now giving them a chore of they're supposed to be on their own to have the ability to pull out their phone, text their need to you. That's never going to happen. Have Have you ever had somebody who say, "Let me know if you need anything." actually let you know that they needed something? Never. Never. Because you've now now you've made it more comfortable on you and now more of an obligation on them. And we go, "Well, you know what? I said all I need to say. I let me know if you need anything. Let me know how I can help." Right? When all you've done is just given them an obligation. You've you've burdened it even more. Of course, they don't want to burden you. They don't want they don't even want to they don't even want to live in some of these moments. They they don't want to exist. and they don't know how to do it. And saying, "Let me know if isn't going to help them." Instead, here's what you do when somebody's grieving. You do the thing. Whatever you thought about doing, go do it. If you wanted to bring them dinner or said, "Let me know if you need any food," just go get them food. Go do the task. Go run the errand. Go show up and do their laundry. Go mow their yard for them. Go do the thing. If I really want you to be there for me and you really want to be there for the other person, you don't have to ask. You just go do. And second of all, I find a lot of time people who are with somebody who's grieving, they don't know what to say. They want to say something like I I want to say something, but I don't I don't really know what to say. I just I feel uncomfortable. What I say is not going to be enough. And so they just stare at their phone and they kind of text out a sentence and they delete it because they don't really know what to say. The best thing to say is just to validate how you would assume it's going to be feeling for them. Nobody deserves what hap that this is totally unfair. I can't believe that this happened. Nobody deserves this. Be be able to express and confirm that what they're feeling is exactly what they should be feeling. Don't go in with the, well, at least they're in a better place. Hey, you know what? Everything happens for a reason. That's not the right time to say that if ever to to be able to try and make them feel better of oh you know I just at least they're you know not is there anything I can do any of that kind of stuff it's like yeah I know you can do you can bring that person back that's what you can do that's not going to happen you can't do that and so you catch yourself in a corner where you genuinely have an interest like how many times people say you're in our thoughts you're my thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers you know praying for you and they haven't once sent up a prayer, right? They're just saying it. If you really mean it, text out the prayer to them. Text the prayer. Dear God, I'm I just ask that you be with Stephen right now. And what? Send the prayer to them. Why Why not encourage them in that versus just saying, hey, just keeping you in my thoughts. If you are, then text them thinking about you. No need to respond. You think just putting it in a Facebook comment is going to do enough? Just here in our prayers. That's that's not connection and that's not authentic. That that's that's the easy shortcut. I think I've spent my whole life struggling with those moments where some something bad has happened to someone or they've been through something and yeah, you you found out over text message and you don't know what to say. You don't know what to say. You're like, "I'm so sorry." Um, and the amount of times I've written something and then deleted it and written something and deleted it. And I actually got some feedback from Samir, um, who is a a very well-known YouTuber creator, and he's he's part of a YouTube channel called Colin and Samir. Their their houses burnt down in the Palisades fire. And I'd say what, four, five, six months later, he came up to me in New York and said, um, "Thank you for the message you sent me because it was specific." And I know there's a cl we have a clip of it cuz we were recording at the time. We were I just come off stage and he was at his at his event in New York and he'd come up to me and said it. And it always stayed with me that he remembered 6 months later. I didn't even really remember the message I sent. He remembered 6 months later that when his house had burnt down, they both just had I think they both had like less than one-year-old kids and both of the houses had burnt down. I sent him something specific I could help him with. I can't I can't remember the details of what I said, but he came up and said, "Thank you for sending me something. Lots of people sent me messages, but I remember you sent me something specific." That hits the theme of when you stop trying to be what's most convenient to you and start doing what might be just a slightly little bit more uncomfortable, a little bit more work. The choice to do something different and be more specific in the thought to to not just say so sorry to hear, right? That's that's that's injustice to be I mean that's that doesn't even touch it. But if you were to say you were to say what is happening is totally unfair like agree with it be specific with it. Same thing with it's the same with compliments. The more specific it is the more genuine it is. The person that you remember the longest is the person who's able to be right there with you and say exactly what you're feeling in that moment and make a genuine offer to to support a real Yes. And also not as you said at the start not an offer that they have to accept because no one accepts them. Yeah. That or make it a condition that they have to reach out to you in order to you consider giving it instead of just doing it or or even when you feel that like I don't really know what to to say but I'm you know what if I were them this is what I'd want and go do the thing. Otherwise, don't say it if you don't mean it. I mean, that's just the to me that's a sign of you're you're not their person because there's so many people that are just fair weather friends that they they want to be there and and be part of the success, but when your face is on the floor and you're at rock bottom, the people you'll remember are the people that show up. Amen. I've heard that so many times from my guests on this podcast where they talk about their hardest moment and it's always who who showed up in that moment that um

### 应对侮辱：沉默、重复、质疑意图

**杰斐逊**总结了应对侮辱的三个步骤：
1.  **保持五到七秒的沉默**，让对方感到不舒服，意识到这不好玩。
2.  **要求对方重复**：“我需要你再说一遍。”大多数人做不到。
3.  **质疑对方的意图**：“你是不是故意让它听起来很粗鲁/伤人/令人不快？”这能让你以一种不被对方言语伤害的方式行事。当有人侮辱你时，他们是在把聚光灯打在自己身上，并希望把它扔给你，以获得你的反应。当你保持沉默并问问题时，他们的言语就会回荡到他们自己身上。很多人甚至在你说任何话之前，就会说“我不该说那句话”。沉默越多，就越尴尬，他们就越会收回。他们意识到你没有上钩。但当你把聚光灯打回去，问他们“你是不是故意让我难堪？你是不是故意让它听起来很伤人？”他们无法忍受说“是”的想法。所以他们必须修正它，他们会说“哦，不，不，不，我的意思是……”然后他们会换一种说法。如果他们坚持说“是的，我就是这个意思”，你就可以说“谢谢你告诉我。”

number five. If you want to be a better communicator, you have to know how to handle the insults, the backbiting, the dismissive, the belittling, the patronizing, the words that people use to try and inflict pain. What do I do? If you want to handle somebody who's trying to hurt you with their words, the first thing you have to do is have a bunch of silence or it's five to seven seconds of nothing. Make it make it enough to where it's uncomfortable where they they know this is not going to be fun. Number two is you ask them to repeat it. I need you to say that again. I need you I I need you to repeat that. Most of the time people can't do it. And number three, if I need to, I ask them, "Did you mean did you mean for that to sound rude? Did you mean for that to sound short? Did you mean for that to sound upsetting?" And what it does is allow you to be able to operate in a way that doesn't allow their words to hurt you or to touch you or that cut you. Whenever somebody is saying something that's to belittle you or insult you, they're they're putting a big spotlight on themselves and they're hoping to throw it on to you to get your reaction. So, they're going to I'm going to say something hurtful to you and then it's like they're turning the spotlight right to you. And then when you ask a question, when you have just silence, it allows their words to kind of echo back to them. And a lot of people will before they even have to say anything, they'll go, I I shouldn't have said that. When the more silence you have, the more awkward it becomes and they kind of have to take it back. They realize you didn't take the bait. But when you put the spotlight and you ask the question, did you do you mean for that to embarrass me? Did you mean for that to sound hurtful? They can't bear the thought of saying yes to that. So, they have to tweak it. They have to fix it. They have to go, "Oh, no, no, no. I mean, what I mean, what I meant to say was and they they go a different way." Now, if they were to double down and say, "Yes, that's exactly what I meant." You get to say, "Thank you for letting me know."

### 认知失调：身份与行为的冲突

**史蒂芬**从神经科学的角度思考，当你让别人承认他们是伤人的，这会造成**认知失调**（Cognitive Dissonance: 指一个人同时持有两种或多种相互冲突的信念、想法、态度或价值观时所体验到的心理不适感）。我们每个人都对自己有一个认知。通过**杰斐逊**的方法，你正在制造认知失调，通过让他们照镜子，看到自己刚才的行为。如果你不认为自己是伤人的人，但你说了非常伤人的话，然后我问你是不是故意伤人，你立刻就触及了我的身份认同。我不想成为一个伤人的人，这导致了失调，即我认为的自己和我的行为之间的差异。所以，我必须缓解其中一个，我必须让它合理化。没有人认为自己是坏人，他们总是认为自己是好人。所以，当你那样对我说时，我必须立刻确认我是一个有意伤害他人的人。那绝不是我想做的。我只是想对你进行一点**煤气灯操纵**，只是想让你痛苦。在那一刻，他们想的是“我希望你像我一样痛苦，我希望我能感受到控制，因为我现在没有控制感，我感到不高兴。所以如果我能让你不高兴，那么我现在就能感觉好一点，我的感受也更合理了。”所以，有些人，尤其是那些善于操纵的人，他们会不高兴，说一些让你不高兴的话，然后转过身说“我不知道你为什么这么不高兴，我很好，我只是很好。我不知道你为什么这么不高兴。”因为他们只是把你扔在了那里。他们只是把这种感觉传递给了你。

I was thinking about like the neuroscience of what's going on there. Yeah. When you get someone to admit that they're hurtful, um I remember interviewing some neuroscientists who talked about this idea of cognitive dissonance, which is where like we all have a perception of who we are. Mh. And I guess by what you're doing there, you're creating the cognitive dissonance, which is the cognitive mental discomfort by making me kind of look in the mirror at who I who I just acted like. If I I don't think I'm a hurtful person. If I say something super hurtful and then you ask me if I meant to be hurtful, you're immediately like speaking to my identity. Yes. And I don't want I'm not a hurtful person, right? And that's causing the the dissonance which is the sort of the disparity between who I think I am and how I just behaved. Yes. And so I have to alleviate one of them. I have to make sense. Nobody believes they're on the side of bad. They always think they're in the side of good. So you by you saying that to me, I immediately have to confirm right that I am a person who is intent on hurting others. Yes. That's not at all what I want to do. I just wanted to gaslight you a little bit. I just want to cause you pain. Yeah. And so at that moment, it's what they're thinking and feeling is I want you to hurt like I'm hurting. I want you I want to feel the control because I don't have a sense of control now and I'm feeling a certain way. I'm upset. So if I can make you upset, well then I can have now I can feel better and more justified about how I'm feeling. And so some people will, especially the manipulative ones, they'll be upset, say something to make you upset, and then turn around and go, I don't know why you're so upset. I'm I'm fine. I'm just fine. I don't know why you're you're so upset. And because they've just left you in it now. Now they all they've done is just pass it on to you. Like I don't like this feeling, so now I'm going to give it to you and I'm I'm totally good. What are you talking about?

### 改变框架：从攻击到好奇

**史蒂芬**回忆起很久以前在健身房的经历，一个男人走过来，情绪激动地声称所有器械都是他的，并问**史蒂芬**是否想打架。**史蒂芬**感到非常 Bizarre，就像一个观察者。他无意中做到了**杰斐逊**所说的：他的语气完全没有改变。他用很低的语气问：“你是不是在健身房里问我打架？”他真诚地问了一些好奇的问题，这立刻**解除了对方的武装**。**杰斐逊**认为，这就像“你还好吗？”你必须暂时关心他们一下，因为大多数时候，当他们大喊大叫，说难听的话时，他们真正传递的信号是“我不好”。总有一些其他的事情正在发生。**杰斐逊**曾遇到有人说了伤人的话，他会问：“你希望我如何回应？”或者“你觉得我会如何回应？”他从未遇到过对方说“我希望你侮辱我”。他们总是会退缩，然后试图解释他们那一刻的感受，因为他们不知道该怎么做。但如果你能放下沮丧，说“你现在是在问我打架吗？”这种“你还好吗”的语气，你的沮丧就会消失。你**完全改变了框架**。他们想要的框架是攻击性，也许那是他们解决问题的方式。但你的框架变成了好奇。

I had a situation in a gym a long time ago where I was on a machine and a guy he said that these all these machines were his so he wanted to use them all. And he just came up to me. This was a long long time ago. And he was so like out of pocket like he was you talked about being in the pocket. Mhm. super emotional within like 15 seconds this sort of slightly older gentleman and basically like asked me if I wanted to have a fight and it was so bizarre to me that I felt like an observer and I genuinely Anybody else seen this? No, it was him in the gym and I was so I was I felt like David Atenburgh like I was just like and I did it and I inadvertently did what you said which is my tone didn't change at all. I spoke to him like this. I'm like did you just ask me for a fight in the gym? I was like, and then the more cuz I asked genuinely like like genuine curious questions and it immediately disarmed him. Yes. But don't do that to strangers in the gym. Oh my god, my tone was so low. Yeah, but that's what it is. It's are you okay? You know, it's you're having to like have to check on them for a second because most of the time when you're hearing them yell and and say ugly things, what they're truly signaling is I'm not okay. It's there's always something else that's going on. I've done it before where somebody said something hurtful and I said, "How did you expect me to respond to that?" Or, "How were you wanting me to respond to that?" Or, "How did you think I was going to respond?" And it's I've never had it where they go, "Well, I expected you to say an insult." Like they it's always them backpedaling and then trying to explain how they're feeling in that moment because they they don't know they don't know how to to do it. But if I can stop, put aside like you did your frustration and say, "Are you asking me for a fight right now?" You know, are is that what you're really asking for? That kind of are you okay kind of thing? That'll all of a sudden your frustration now goes away.

### 学习心态：问题是强大的武器

**杰斐逊**认为，任何时候，如果你抱着“**有所学习**”的心态，而不是“有所证明”的心态，你就能更好地应对。在那种情况下，你本可以轻易地试图证明什么，比如“你以为你在和谁说话？”但你却选择了好奇：“这里发生了什么？”**问题是强大的武器**。问题能解除那些试图对你具有攻击性的人的武装，因为他们不想要那样的镜子。他们不想看到自己展现出的丑陋。但任何时候，当有人表现出攻击性时，很多人会说“如果有人对我说了这么难听的话，我该如何快速反击？”**杰斐逊**会说：“好的，我假设他们是以正常的音量说的。他们的需求是什么？他们真正感受到了什么？”因为如果你只是回应反应，你永远不会听到事情的结局。

You've changed the frame completely. Absolutely. Cuz the frame they wanted was aggression. Maybe that's the the language or the frame that they know as the way to solve problems. But yours was like in that scenario changed to curiosity, which was like, "What? How did that Yeah. Anytime you actually have a mindset of instead of having something well don't have something to prove have something to learn. And so in that moment you could have easily tried to prove something of who who do you think you're talking to? Do you know what I you could have played that card instead you actually got curious of what's going on here? Are you asking me for questions are powerful that way. questions are disarming for somebody who's trying to be aggressive with you because they're not looking for that type of mirror. They don't want a mirror. They don't want to see the ugly that they're putting out there. But anytime somebody has that very aggressive, I have so many people who go, if somebody said this to me and was so ugly and said this horrible thing and they're looking for a quick comeback, which I can give it to them, but if they really care about the relationship, I say, "Okay, I assume they said it at normal volume. What's their need? Like, what are they what are they really feeling?" Because if you just respond to the reaction, you're you're not going to hear the end of it.

### 关系沟通三原则：验证、重置、分而治之

我们都有触发点，**杰斐逊**也有。他分享了改善人际关系的三大原则：
1.  **先验证，后表达沮丧**：如果你一开始就带着沮丧回应，你每次都会输。所以要**验证**，说“你当然会这样感受，这完全合理，我能理解你为什么会有这种感受。”承认他们有权那样感受。否则，伴侣会觉得“我太情绪化了”，然后你会离开。这是一种被抛弃感。所以，如果你能让他们知道“你没有过分，我有能力和弹性来应对这段关系”，因为你也不会总是处于最佳状态。但如果你能给彼此一个安全的空间来展现混乱，那么你们就能拥有真正的关系。
2.  **重置是你的万能牌**：请求**重置**（Reset: 在对话或关系中，指暂停当前的冲突或僵局，重新开始，以更建设性的方式进行沟通）。如果你说“你知道吗，我刚才说得不对。我能再试一次吗？我刚才说得不是最好的方式，对吗？我本可以做得更好。”一旦你请求重置，没有人会拒绝你。没有人会说“不，不，你必须坚持下去，继续失败。”就像玩电子游戏一样，如果你知道最终会输，为什么还要继续玩？你会重新开始，再试一次。所以，给自己和对方重新开始的机会，是关系沟通中必不可少的一部分。
3.  **把问题切薄**：很多时候，如果我们在进行一场大的对话，我们会把过去的事情都扯进来，堆积如山，然后感到绝望。但如果我能把每个问题单独切开，说“我确实想谈谈这个，我想先解决眼前的问题”，那一切都会好得多。如果你能把每个部分切开，看到需求并验证它，他总是看到更好的结果。

And we all have triggers. Same. I I I definitely have mine. I can't I can't I can't say anything. I'll tell you one of the biggest things that has helped me too in um any any if anybody's wanting to improve their personal relationships with a partner or anything. It's one is understanding validate first. Frustration comes le next. If I respond first with frustration, I'm going to lose every time. So it's validating. It's saying of course you'd feel this way. It totally makes sense. I can see how you feel that way. Acknowledging that it's okay for them to feel that way. Otherwise, the partner is going to feel like I'm being too much. And if I'm being too much, then you're going to leave, right? It's the it's the same sense of abandonment. So, if I can hit that, you're not being too much. I have the capacity and the I can be elastic in this relationship because I'm not going to be my best self all the time, too. But if I can give you a safe space for you to be messy and me to be messy, then you're actually going to have that relationship. Number two, it's understanding that resets is your uno wild card. Asking for a reset for if I were to say, you know what, I didn't say that right. You know what? Can I can I try that again? I didn't say that the best way, did I? You know, I I could have done that better. As soon as I start and ask for a reset, I've never had anybody told me no. Nobody goes, "No, no, you have to stick with it right now. Go ahead. Keep failing." Like we in a video game, we wouldn't Why would you keep playing if you knew you're ultimately going to lose? It's you restart. You try again. And so giving yourself the grace and the other person the grace to have the ability to start over again is a necessary part of communicating in relationships. And three is slice it thinner. A lot of the times if we're having a big conversation, we bring up somebody might bring up the past that past thing and we just kind of add it on and clummit on when we start to kind of feel hopeless about it. But if I can slice each issue by itself and say, I do want to talk about this. I want to address what's in front of us first, that makes everything go a whole lot better. But if I can slice each part and see the need and validate that, I've always seen that go better.

### 沟通中的百分比：理解与合作

**史蒂芬**提到**布琳·布朗**（Brené Brown: 美国研究教授、作家，以其关于脆弱、勇气、羞耻和同理心的研究而闻名）的一个观点：当她下班回家后，会告诉伴侣自己还有多少“能量”（Tank: 比喻精力或耐心储备）。她说：“听着，我只有10%的能量了，我今天做不了了。”**杰斐逊**认为这非常好。使用百分比进行对话非常有帮助，无论是在关系中还是工作中。比如，在关系中，你可以说：“我只有10%的能量了，你有40%，我们加起来，总能解决问题，但至少我知道你现在是什么状态。”在工作中也是如此。他鼓励人们在会议中提出想法时，不要说“如果……会怎样？”因为那样大家都会开始攻击它。但如果他们说：“听着，我有一个30%的想法。”那么神奇的事情就会发生，每个人都想加入进来。如果你说：“**史蒂芬**，我有一个20%的想法，我需要你帮助完成剩下的80%。”你就会觉得“哦，我能做到。”然后每个人都会开始完善它，而不是试图拆毁它。或者即使在对话中，如果你说：“听着，我知道我可能说得不对，我大概只有60%的把握。”这至少确认了你知道自己说的不总是对的。

And on that first point about um how you engage with your your partner during conflict, one of the most useful things I heard recently was a clip I actually saw of Bnee Brown talking about when she comes home after like a long day. Yeah. She will tell her partner how much she has in the tank. It's so good. And so she'll turn to her partner and say, "Listen, I've got 10%. I can't do this today." Right? And I remember getting the clip and sending it to my partner because it's those that's some of the vocabulary that probably would have really helped a lot of my relationships, which is just first expressing where I'm operating from. So good. And I don't think anybody is going to be on the receiving end of honestly, I've got like 10% in the tank today and go, "Nope, I want to do this now." Like exactly. Well, using percentages in conversation is incredibly helpful. Both in relationships, like Bnee mentioned, of saying, you know what, I got 10%, you got 40%, let's put it together, and we're going to make it work, but I at least know where you're coming from. Same thing at work, right? I've seen what I encourage is when people are in a meeting and they can put out an idea, right? Rather than going, "What if?" Because what happens is everybody just starts to kill it, you know? They start pointing arrows at it because it's because it wasn't their idea. So, we need to tank it down. But if they come at it and say, "Look, I got 30% of an idea," then what happens magically is that everybody else wants to join in. So, if I were to say, "Look, I Steve, I got 20% of an idea. I need your help with the other 80." All of a sudden, you take it as a, "Oh, me? I can I can do that." And then everybody else starts to build it up rather than trying to tear it down. Or even if in conversation, if I say, "Look, I know I'm not going to have the right words. I'm going to have about 60% of it. Like that. At least is me confirming that I know what I'm saying is not going to always be the right thing to say.

### 婚姻的真相：不是50/50，而是互相扶持

**史蒂芬**提到他希望自己能更多地这样做。他播放了一段**蒂姆·费里斯**（Tim Ferriss: 美国作家、企业家、播客主持人）的片段，其中提到“每个人都说婚姻应该是50/50，这是我听过最扯淡的话。它从来都不是50/50。”所以他们会量化自己的状态。如果**史蒂芬**回家说他只有20%的能量，无论是精力、投入、仁慈还是耐心，他只有20%，那么伴侣就会说“我来帮你，我来承担80%”。有时他们都只有20%的能量，比如他妈妈生病时，他只有10%，而**史蒂芬**只有25%。所以他们知道，如果总能量低于100%，他们就需要坐下来，制定一个互相友善的计划。**杰斐逊**非常喜欢这个观点。婚姻不是50/50。**伴侣关系之所以有效，是因为你能承担对方的20%，或者对方能承担你的20%**。当你们都只有20%时，你们会有一个计划，确保不会互相伤害。

I wish I did that more. This is um I believe this is the clip I'm talking about. It was Tim Ferris. Everyone says marriage should be 50/50. It's the biggest crack of [ __ ] I've ever heard. It's never 50/50. Yeah. Ever. And so what we do is we quantify where we are. So if Steve comes home and he'll be like, I got 20. Just in terms of energy, just energy, investment, kindness, patience, I'm at a 20 and I'll be like, I'll cover you. I got you, brother. Like, I'll pull the 80. Sometimes we come home, which we have done a lot. My mom has been sick. And I'll say, I've got 10. And Steo, like two days ago said, I'm riding a solid 25. So, we know that we have to sit down at the table anytime we have less than 100 combined and figure out a plan of kindness toward each other. Oh, I love that. Yeah, because the thing is marriage is not something that's 50/50. A partnership works when you can carry their 20 or they can carry your 20. And that when you both just have 20, you have a plan where you don't hurt each other.

### 关系质量与沟通质量：冲突是成长的机会

**杰斐逊**认为，我们每天都会犯的错误是试图用10%的能量解决大问题。他和**塞拉**吵架时，通常很快就结束，但有些时候，他就是不想道歉，不想感到抱歉。他内心有很多东西，还没准备好。所以，对他来说最有帮助的是，当他处于愤怒的边缘，不想让步时，他会说“我的电量快用完了”，就像iPhone电量变红一样。一旦他知道自己处于那种状态，他们就会暂停，否则两个小时后，你会说出更糟糕的话，然后不得不道歉。所以，**越快暂停，关系沟通就越好**。暂停的价值在于，即使只是五分钟的休息，回来后你也会有一个不同的心态，就像重新开始一样。为什么要把一个人留在场上三个小时，不让他们休息呢？我们身体上会这样做，但精神上却不会。如果你想知道关系的秘诀，最有价值的指标是：**对话的质量等于关系的质量**。换句话说，关系的质量等于沟通的质量。那些离婚或关系糟糕的夫妻，是因为他们在积极方面还行，但不知道如何处理消极方面。所以，衡量标准不仅是能否谈论快乐的事情，而是你能在困难和悲伤时刻坚持多久，因为这些时刻总会发生。很多人离婚了，并非因为不再相爱，而是因为他们停止了沟通。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So good. That's the mistake I've made multiple times. Oh. I try and solve big problems with 10. That's the mistake we make every day. Yeah. I mean, for me and with Sierra and I, it's usually if we're in a part of an argument, typically our arguments end pretty quickly, but the ones that go long, it's sometimes, you know, I just don't feel like it. You know, I I could give an apology, you could give an apology, and some I just don't feel I don't feel like being sorry right now. I will later, but I in the moment, I'm just I I I I just got this stuff in me and I'm not ready yet. And so what happens for me and what's been so helpful is when I'm aggravated at that edge and I don't want to give a thing is to say my battery's in the red like we say in the red because of you know iPhone it's like I'm once I know I'm in that place we know to time out because it's or else you'd be two hours in and you're still now you've just said way worse things you know that you're going to apologize for and so often when the quicker you can get to a timeout like if you want to know how well a a relationship communicates. Look how often they take timeouts because timeouts are I mean they're the the amount of value you get in just a pause and then even five minutes coming back to it. you have a different like okay here we go like a fresh fresh start like why would you leave somebody on the field for three hours and never give them a rest and you think I can't I we do it physically but I'm not going to do it mentally like if you if you want to know the key to the relationship the metric that is the most valuable key to a relationship is that the measure The quality of the conversation is equal to the quality of the relationship. Said differently, the quality of the relationship is equal to the quality of the communication. You look at all these couples that are divorcing, okay? Or the couples that are in bad states. It's because they were okay in the positive, but they don't know how to deal deal with the negative. So, it's it's the measure of not just can we talk about the happy stuff, the if you talk I I talk to these elderly couples that have been married for 50 years and I say, "What's what's your secret?" It's it's not can you be happy in the happy. It's can you how long can you sit with the hard and how how long can you be in the in the sad times because those are going to happen. And I see that so many with the people. There's so many people who communicate with me or message or and they're going through a divorce or they have been divorced and you realize that it's it's not often that they fell out of love. They fell out of communication. They they stopped talking to each other.

### 冲突管理：关系健康的预测指标

**史蒂芬**认为，我们被灌输的一个巨大误解是，好关系的标志是缺乏冲突。但如果你有过长期的关系，你会发现重要的不是冲突的数量，而是**如何管理冲突**。他读过一句从未忘记的话：“你可以通过每次伤口是愈合到101%还是99%来预测一段关系的长期健康状况。”也就是说，**你的冲突是否让你变得更强大**？他回顾自己与伴侣的冲突，发现它们确实加深了关系的根基，是**富有成效的冲突**，让他们变得更强大。这部分归因于**杰斐逊**所说的许多事情，比如不试图在每次争论中都赢。**杰斐逊**的妻子**塞拉**也说“无论如何都好”。你希望关系中有冲突，是为了成长。个体成长很少能独自发生，它必须是**关系性的**，必须与他人一起。你必须经历冲突，才能变得更好。他见过很多人，他们双手抱头，不知道如何与对方交流，因为他们放弃了修复，却一味地指责。最近一项研究表明，预测孩子在父母关系中幸福感的最大因素，并非父母是否结婚或离婚，而是他们如何处理冲突。因为有多少父母虽然在一起，但却吵得不可开交？而那些离婚但沟通良好，从不把孩子卷入其中，不把孩子当作传话筒的父母，他们能够改变孩子一生的轨迹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

This is I think one of the great myths we're sold when we get into our first relationship is we think that the sign of a good relationship is the lack of conflict. But if you've ever been in a long relationship, I think over time you start to figure that it's not the amount of conflict. It's like it's it's how one manages the conflict. I read a quote which I've never forgotten which said you can predict the long-term health of a relationship by whether each cut heals to 101% or 99%. I.e. does your conflict make you stronger? Yeah. And if I look back through the conflict that I've had with like my partner that I've been with a long time now, I go it has actually deepened the roots. Yeah, it has to like it's been productive conflict. Mhm. You know, which has made us stronger. Um and that and that in part is because of many of the things that you talk about which is like trying not to win every argument, right? And all the things in your book. It's Yeah. Well, that's Sierra. That's what Sierra talks about. Either way, it's good. Like it's the conflict. You want conflict in your relationship for the growth. It is rare that you can have individual growth alone. It has to be relational 100%. It has to be with other people. I I I can read a book on how to do something, but until I do it, it's it's a totally different game. So I I I learn relationally with things and with other people and places, but for sure relationship, I mean, there's just no there's no other way to go around it. you have to have the conflict if you want to be if you want to be better. And I I've seen so many times where the people um they face in their hands, they don't know how to talk to one another because they gave up on trying to repair, but they're they're all in on trying to blame. Mhm. And so when you are trying to kind of undo what has to be done that makes it all the more difficult because it's just so many years where there could have been repair but there there hasn't been and in turn that really hurts the relationship. I read a recent study that the biggest predictor of the child's well-being within the parental relationship is not whether they were married or divorced. It was how they dealt with conflict. I mean, because how many people have had parents that are still together but fight terribly? Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. And in in fact should probably maybe not be together. Yeah. Or those that they're divorced but communicate. Great. Yeah. And they never put their child in the middle of it and didn't use the child as a a male carrier between the two. to to be able to do that is I mean you're you get to change the whole trajectory of of a child's life at some point.

### AI沟通工具：Whisper Flow

我们总有一天要原谅父母，因为他们也是孩子，也是被父母抚养长大的，他们也是第一次为人父母。**杰斐逊**即将推出一本名为《**下一次对话练习册**》（The Next Conversation Workbook）的实用练习册，其中包含减少争吵、增加对话的实用练习，将他书中的所有内容转化为可操作的蓝图框架，帮助人们将这些习惯融入生活。他还在开发一款**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，人工智能）工具，名为**Whisper Flow**，它整合了他的所有内容（书籍、播客、社交媒体片段），成为一个**小型语言模型**（Small Language Model: 相对于大型语言模型，规模更小、训练数据更少，但针对特定任务或领域进行优化，效率更高）。每个人都可以拥有自己的个人沟通专家，全天候提供服务。人们可以在上面练习。比如，如果你要参加一个重要会议，想听起来很自信，该怎么做？或者你的伴侣不听你说话，或者很不高兴，该怎么做？你可以立即应用这些建议，从不同的角度看待问题。他最喜欢的功能是让它扮演一个刻薄傲慢的老板，然后进行练习，看看你的回应是否是最好的。**Whisper Flow**比打字快四倍。

So it has my book, it has my podcasts, it has my you any of my social clips of it has it all. And so it's a small language model to where it's everybody can have their own personal communication expert, you know, 247 kind of thing. It's what they have on it, but where people get to practice. So what I love about it the most is let's say you you say I'm about to go into a important meeting and I want to sound really confident.

You apply those right in that that moment and gives you a different way of perspecting a different way of seeing things from a different view or what I definitely what I've uh like is to tell it to be a boss. Be my boss who's really mean and arrogant and let's do an exercise of how to respond to this situation. and you test is that response going to be the best response and allow it to kind of have a a different way of practicing things that maybe you need to be ready for cuz some people need to be ready for the hard response. I'll link that below too. Yeah. So people can have a play with that and sign up. I'm excited.

We have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves a question for the next question left for you is who are you most dying to meet and why? Oh, that's a great one. um person I would love to meet right now is probably Bnee Brown. That's probably it. Really, the fact that you brought her up. The reason why is because I know that she's been in the space a long time. And I feel that when she shares stuff, it's very genuine. Like there's no guessing that she's real. Yeah. She's about as real and raw as authentic as you can get. She's also a Longhorn Texas Longhorn fan which I'm a fan, but I feel like when and this is just me personally, I kind of got pushed into this field and you you always look for people that are your own anchors in life of who you'd want to be a mentor kind of thing. And that's somebody who's I feel like has been in the the world and and knows some things and has just some incredible knowledge that's helped a lot of people. She's most certainly authentic. She's incredible. Yeah. Well, I listen, if people haven't bought your book, which is almost nobody, but if there are still some people out there that have haven't bought this book, I highly recommend it. I think I um included it in my Smith collection as well in the UK. You did such a smash hit success. It's a success on two dimensions. It's sales and it's impact. Thank you. And um it's also incredibly accessible. So it's not like a a complicated science book and it's written for normal people that are going through very real relatable normal problems. And um I think that's why it's been so successful. I think you you approach these challenges from a very real place. And maybe that's in part why it's been so wonderfully received and so relatable is because, you know, you're a trial attorney that's bringing this stuff to the masses, but you're not like a PhD scholar who might have draw thrown up the drawbridge because they they they've spent all their life in academia. And I think the way that you communicate is so relatable and resonant that it's no wonder that you're you've been on an absolute unbelievable terror over the last couple years. It's phenomenal. Like crazy crazy incredible. So congratulations and thank you from all the people that you've given thanks man a little bit of light to a little bit of um you've empowered them with information so that they can live the life that they um they deserve to live. That's a special thing Jefferson. I appreciate it. Thank you Ste. If there's anything we need it is connection especially in the world we're living in today. And that is exactly why we created these conversation cards. Because on this show, when I sit here with my guests and have those deep, intimate conversations, this remarkable thing happens time and time again. We feel deeply connected to each other. At the end of every episode, the guest I'm interviewing leaves a question for the next guest, and we've turned them into these conversation cards. And we've added these twist cards to make your conversations even more interesting. And there are so many more twists along the way with the conversation cards. This is the brand new edition. And for the first time ever, I've added to the pack this gold card, which is an exclusive question from me. But I'm only putting the gold cards in the first run of conversation cards.

### 沟通大师的五个核心要素与法庭智慧

**Steven Bartlett**: 对于任何想要成为沟通大师并在生活中得偿所愿的人来说，哪五件事是最重要的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What are the five most important things for anyone who's striving to be a masterful communicator to get what they want out of life?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第一是真实性（Authenticity），而**存在感**（Presence）是真实性的最高形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: The first is authenticity and presence is the highest form of authenticity.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的，关于这一点，我要在屏幕上播放那个关于 Miley Cyrus 和 Amy Campbell 疯传的视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay, on that point, I'm going to play this video on the screen that went viral of Marley Cyrus and Amy Campbell.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 哦，我还没看过这个。看得很痛苦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Oh, I haven't seen this. That's painful to watch.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第二，减少干扰。第三，停止过度解释。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number two, reduce the amount of distraction. Three, stop overexplaining.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第四，知道如何应对他们的悲伤。我会详细讲解这几点，但第五点是，你必须知道如何应对**自恋者**（Narcissist）和**煤气灯操纵者**（Gaslighter）。我该怎么做？让我来展示给你看。首先，你需要过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number four, know how to deal with their sadness. And I'll go through all of these in detail, but number five is you have to know how to handle the narcissist and the gaslighter. What do I do? Let me show you. First, you need to come.

</details>

### 从法庭到生活的沟通艺术

**Steven Bartlett**: 请介绍一下 Jefferson Fisher。你的职业是什么？你会如何定义你的职业？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Jefferson Fisher. What do you do professionally? What is your How do you sort of characterize your profession?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 嗯，我的本职是一名**出庭律师**（Trial Attorney）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Well, I'm a trial attorney by trade.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What does that mean?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 这意味着我帮助客户解决法律需求。我拥有人身伤害法的委员会认证。所以，当人们受伤时，我会出庭。这意味着有些律师从不去法庭，而我会走进法庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: That means I help clients with legal needs. I'm board certified in personal injury. So, when people get hurt, I have trials. So, that means there are other attorneys that don't ever go to a courtroom. I go into a courtroom.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 然后你会站在法官面前……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Then you stand before a judge...

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 对，有一个法官，有一个陪审团，有一个法庭书记员，一个法警，还有对方律师。房间里有人，你要试图说服那些人接受你的观点以获得特定的结果。我基于客户的事实进行辩护，以获得他们想要的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: ...and a Yeah. You have a judge, you have a jury, you have a court reporter, a baiff, you have opposing attorneys. There are people in the room and you try and convince those people of your point of view to get a particular outcome. I advocate my client's facts in order to get the result that they want.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，为什么你认为写一本关于谈话、关于如何从我们在乎的人那里获得我们想要的东西的书很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, why did you think it was important to write a book about conversation talking, getting what you want from the conversations we have with people we care about?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 因为我一次又一次地看到，当我培训客户——也就是我在为他们的交叉质询或庭外取证做准备时——他们真的不知道如何应对冲突。我想不出除了拳击手或 UFC 选手这类直接处理实际冲突并承受打击的人之外，还有什么职业比法律界和出庭律师更深陷于冲突之中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Because I have seen time and time again that when I am training a client is what I call I'm preparing them for cross- examination for deposition they really don't know how to engage in conflict. And so I can't think of any other profession that is more entrenched in conflict maybe outside of a a boxer or some you know UFC something that deals with actual conflict and sits there and listens to it all than in the legal world in a trial attorney.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 我写那本书以及那本书适用的原因是，我把教给我每一位客户的很多课程都放进了书里，因为我坐在那里为他们准备交叉质询时意识到，噢等等，他们对自己所处的冲突怕得要死。那是他们一生中最情绪化、压力最大、最不知所措的时刻。那是我的工作，去牵着他们的手说：“我们将这样去面对。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: The reason why I wrote that book and how that book applies is I took a lot of the lessons that I teach every one of my clients and put them in that book because I'm sitting there preparing them for cross-examination and realizing, oh, wait, they are deathly afraid of the conflict that they're in. is most of the time it's the most emotional, stressful, overwhelmed they are ever in their life... And so it's my job to kind of take their hand and say, "This is how we're going to this is how we're going to do it."

</details>

### “在口袋里” (In the Pocket) 的气场与掌控

**Steven Bartlett**: 如果我在这方面成为绝对的大师，我的生活会有什么变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: How would my life change if I became an absolute master in this?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 其次的好处是你意识到**“我是对的”被高估了**。如果你告诉我天空是紫色的，请便，Steven。这不需要触及我的自我认知或我的任何观点。如果我能拥有这种安心感，知道不需要同意你也能理解你，那我就不用回击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: A second benefit of it is that you realize being right is overrated. You can, if you tell me the sky is purple, knock yourself out, Stephen. It doesn't have to touch anything with me on on who I am or any of my opinions... And if you can have the peace of mind of knowing I don't need to agree with you to understand you.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 当你在法官面前处理案件时，你是否有意识地思考过你的肢体语言、眼神交流或其他你在这些年学到的对于让你的信息被听取非常重要的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And when you're in a case in front of a judge, is is there anything else that you're intentionally thinking about with, I don't know, your body language or the eye contact or any of these other things that you've learned over time are really important to get your message heard?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 我的言行举止就像**我以前来过这里一样**。走进一个房间，就像你以前来过一样，好像其他人都只是访客。在每次审判之前，在陪审团、法官进来之前，我会对自己说，这是我的客厅，其他人只是访客。我会摸摸椅子，把手放在栏杆上，我会四处走动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: I'm speaking like I've been there before... walk into a room like you've been there before, as if everybody else is just visiting. So, what I do before every trial is I will go in there before the jury comes in, the judge comes in, everybody comes in and I say to myself, this is my living room and everybody else is just visiting. I will touch the chairs. I will put my hands on the banisters. I will walk around.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 当我能散发出那种自信时，每一位观看的陪审员突然就会平静下来。他们会想，这里谁可以依靠？谁更值得信赖？如果你总是对需要情绪化的情境做出反应，在某种意义上你就没有注意谁在看着你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: And when I can exude that kind of confidence that every juror that watches, all of a sudden it calms them down. They go, who can I rely on here? Who's more trustworthy?... So, if you are always reacting to situations in which you have to be emotional with in a sense that you're not paying attention to who's watching you.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那个，你称之为“光环”（Aura）吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Is that what people call aura?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 也许有些人称之为“Swagger”（范儿）。是的，光环。我喜欢说**“在口袋里”（In the pocket）**，因为它提醒我，正确的时机就是我的时机。这就是所谓的像爵士乐队一样“在口袋里”——每个人都在节拍上，我不急，也不慢，我就在那个点上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Swagger maybe as some people call it. Yeah. Aura... I like to say in the pocket because it just reminds me of the right timing is my timing... I'm just in the pocket like a a jazz band. Like everybody is on everybody's on beat and so I'm not I'm not rushing. I'm not slowing down. I'm just right in the pocket.

</details>

### Gaslighting（煤气灯效应）与自恋者

**Steven Bartlett**: 自从这本书出版以来，人们和你谈论最多的是什么？是关于处理困难对话和困难的人吗？社会上有一个被过度使用的词叫**Gaslighting**（煤气灯效应）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: ...what are the chapters that have stood out the most to people and you mentioned that it tends to be things around dealing with difficult conversations dealing with difficult people... And one of the phrases that's been arguably overused a lot in society is this phrase gaslighting.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 是的，Gaslighting 和撒谎的区别在于：撒谎是表层层面的，比如我可以告诉你这个杯子是红色的而不是银色的。那是个谎言。而 Gaslighting 是我试图将你的现实改变成我的现实。我试图让你质疑其他人如何看待你，包括我自己，以及你如何看待你自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Yes. Well, let me put it this way. The difference between gaslighting and lying. Lying is a surface level of I could tell you instead of having a silver cup, this is a red cup. Well, that would be a lie. Gaslighting is I'm trying to alter your reality into mine. I'm I'm trying to make you question how other people perceive you, including myself. How you perceive yourself.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 事实上，**我也做过煤气灯操纵者（Gaslighter）**。每个人都做过，无论他们是否有意为之。因为这都源于那种自我保护的感觉，这种防御性，我不希望人们知道我生活中发生的真相，所以我去误导。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Here's the truth. I have been the gaslighter. Everybody has been the gaslighter whether they intentionally know it or not. Because it's all that feeling of preservation of defensiveness of I don't want people to know the truth of of what's happening in my life so I'm going to mislead.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 在你看来，撒谎和 Gaslighting 之间的区别是意图吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: ...is the difference in your mind intention?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 是意图。意图是**我是掌控者，而不是你**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: It to the intention. It's the intention. The tension is I'm the one in control, not you.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 你试图控制叙事。你想同时成为导演、制片人和演员，为了你自己的议程和控制欲。我是我自己电影里的主角，你需要这样表现，你需要相信这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: So, you are trying to control the narrative. You are trying to be both director, producer, and actor for your own agenda... I'm I'm the character in my own movie. I'm the main character. And you need to behave this way. You need to believe this.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 你认为女性比男性更容易被 Gaslight 吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So do you think women get gas lit more than men?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 是的。根据我的书的读者反馈，绝大多数是女性。我并不是说这是什么实证研究。但这表明这听起来是准确的。我确实认为，在我的内容受众中，很多女性说她们在职场中感觉能力被质疑，做决定的能力被怀疑，不被信任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Yes... from my feedback from the people that have read my book and the people who give me feedback on my book, Yeah. It's majority vast majority are are women... It shows me that that sounds about right. I do think from the people that follow my content... so many women say I feel like I'm in this workplace and they are doubting my competence. They're doubting my ability to make decisions. I'm not being believed.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么关于应对自恋者（Narcissists）的讨论呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What about the conversation around like dealing with narcissists?

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 对自恋者来说，这是一种**“赞美或挑衅”（Praise or Provoke）**的游戏。意思是，如果我没有用赞美沐浴你，那么自恋者就会转向挑衅，以制造争吵来达到同样的效果。他们从挫败感中获得的快乐，就像他们从你的赞美中获得的一样多，因为他们获得了同样类型的控制。

**Jefferson Fisher**: It's a it's a game for narcissists of praise or provoke. Meaning, if I am not showering you with praise, then the narcissist will turn to provoke in order to create an argument for the same effect. They they delight in frustration just as may just as much as they delight in your praise because they get the same type of control.

**Jefferson Fisher**: 我该怎么做？一，限制接触。二，了解你所处的游戏。三，使用**中性陈述**（Neutral Statements）。我会使用像“了解了”、“谢谢分享”、“已记录”这样的中性陈述，让他们无法抓住并继续对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: I know I don't have to say anything to that person. Two, I'm going to limit my distance to them. And three, I'm going to use neutral statements. I'm going to use neutral statements like that's good to know. Thanks for sharing. Noted and things that they can't grab on to and continue to have in a conversation.

### 五个沟通关键要素（详细解析）

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想请你总结一下，如果你必须给我五个最重要的建议，让任何人都能成为沟通大师并在生活中得偿所愿，那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So what are the what are the five most important things to summarize if you had to give me five.

</details>

#### 1. 真实性 (Authenticity)

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第一是真实性。如果我不能对你真诚，不能对你真实，那我就无法成为你的任何人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: The first is authenticity. If I cannot be genuine with you, if I cannot be real with you, then I can be nobody to you.

</details>

#### 2. 减少干扰 (Reduce Distraction)

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第二，减少干扰。这意味着要减少你使用手机的频率。（拿出一根红绳）这根绳子代表我们之间的连接。它是紧绷的。如果我在和你说话时拿出手机，即使我还在听，你感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number two, reduce the amount of distraction... And that means eliminate how often you're on your phone... This string right now represents the connection between us in conversation. It's tight... So, I just pulled out my phone and now I'm looking. And what did you feel in the line?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我感觉那种紧绷感消失了，变得松弛了。感觉不被尊重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I felt like the tightness went it went loose... It felt disrespectful.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 没错。如果你想成为一个更好的沟通者，你必须理解真正连接的定义。那就是保持绳子紧绷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Yeah... So if you want to be a better communicator, you have to understand the definition of true connection. It's keeping it taught.

</details>

#### 3. 停止过度解释 (Stop Over-explaining)

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第三，停止过度解释。与其做瀑布，不如做一口井。意思是，与其试图倾泻信息，不如自信地持有你的知识。如果他们有问题，他们会问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Three, stop overexplaining... Instead of being a waterfall, be a well. Meaning rather than trying to gush out information... you have a confidence in holding your knowledge. If they have a question, they'll ask.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 许多人在说话前都在想自己要说什么。我教的是：**让你的第一个词是你的呼吸**。当你在第一个词该出现的地方放一个呼吸时，其他一切都会流畅起来。真正自信的人知道他们不需要总是对的，也不需要知道所有答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: What I teach is let your first word be your breath. Meaning when you put a breath where the first word should be, everything else flows... People who are truly confident know they don't always have to get it right.

</details>

#### 4. 应对悲伤 (Deal with Sadness)

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第四，知道如何应对他们的悲伤。当某人悲伤时，你不要做的是以“如果需要什么请告诉我”开头。你这么做只是给了他们一项家务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number four, know how to deal with their sadness... when somebody is grieving, what you do not do is begin with let me know if... All you're doing is giving them a chore.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 相反，你直接去做那件事。去给他们买饭，去帮他们除草。不要问，直接做。如果你真的想表达关心，就把祈祷词发给他们，而不仅仅是说“为你祈祷”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Instead, here's what you do when somebody's grieving. You do the thing... just go get them food. Go do the task... If you really mean it, text out the prayer to them.

</details>

#### 5. 应对侮辱 (Handle Insults)

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第五，知道如何处理侮辱。如果你想应对试图用言语伤害你的人，首先你要做的是保持沉默，大约5到7秒的**什么都不做**。让这种沉默变得令人不适。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number five... you have to know how to handle the insults... If you want to handle somebody who's trying to hurt you with their words, the first thing you have to do is have a bunch of silence or it's five to seven seconds of nothing.

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 第二，要求他们重复一遍。“我需要你再说一遍。”大多数时候人们做不到。第三，如果需要，我会问他们：“你是想让这话听起来很粗鲁吗？你是想让这话听起来伤人吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Number two is you ask them to repeat it... Most of the time people can't do it. And number three, if I need to, I ask them, "Did you mean did you mean for that to sound rude?... Did you mean for that to sound upsetting?"

</details>

**Jefferson Fisher**: 这就像把聚光灯转回到他们身上。这会制造**认知失调**（Cognitive Dissonance），因为没有人认为自己是坏人。当你问那个问题时，他们不得不面对那个身份，通常他们会退缩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jefferson Fisher**: Whenever somebody is saying something that's to belittle you... they're putting a big spotlight on themselves... And then when you ask a question... it allows their words to kind of echo back to them... They can't bear the thought of saying yes to that. So, they have to tweak it.
