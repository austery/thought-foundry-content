### 嘉宾介绍与政府业务背景

**Amit:** 好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期节目。今天我请来了 Adam，也就是 Gokarp。我把他的推特链接放在聊天区了，还没关注他的朋友可以去关注一下。我的频道有很多新订阅者，所以如果你不认识 Adam，他是 Palantir 社区的**OG**（Original Gangsters：指元老级或创始成员）之一，是帮助大家理解 Palantir 政府业务的绝对瑰宝。我想他过去四年里花了无数个小时，我估计得超过一万小时，才像现在这样深入理解政府业务。他确实帮助了整个散户社区理解这一点。过去一年我们大概做了六七次直播，所以这次应该是第八次了。我们将更深入地探讨政府业务。Adam，你好吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode. I am here today with Adam aka Gokarp. I'm putting his Twitter in the chat for those that haven't followed him yet. I have a lot of new subscribers to the channel. So if you don't know who Adam is, he is one of the OGs of the Palantir community, an absolute gem to everyone being able to understand this government business. I think he has spent the past four years I don't know how many hours. I think he got to put over well over 10,000 into understand the government business the way he has and he really has helped the entire retail community understand it. We've done about like six or seven streams over the past year and so I guess this is our eighth one. We're going to go deeper into the government business. Adam, how you doing?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 很好，老兄。真不敢相信已经做了六七次了。是的，我看《南方公园》，但我仍然完全不知道那个 67 的梗是什么意思，所以我就跟着笑笑。感谢上帝，Peter Thiel 也在里面客串了一下，因为没有什么比在《南方公园》的剧集里被调侃更有说服力了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Good man. It's hard to believe it's been six or seven and yes I watch South Park. I still have zero idea what the 67 thing means. So, I'll just laugh along with it. And thank God Peter Thiel got his own little cameo in there cuz nothing's more validating than being made fun of in a South Park episode.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 没什么比这更有说服力了。好吧，我们直接进入正题。通常 Adam 来直播时，关于政府业务他总有很多东西要谈。四年前，Palantir 的政府业务因占收入比重过大而备受批评。现在虽然占比不如以前，但它几乎被看作是一种更积极的因素，因为它非常“粘性”。考虑到我们现有的政府以及 Palantir 所展现的利润率，政府业务不像商业业务那样波动，这实际上是件好事。所以，过去几年里，市场的叙事确实发生了转变，而 Adam 一直在关注这些叙事。在我们深入探讨所有政府业务之前，Adam，我们从这里开始吧。我们刚刚经历了公司历史上可以说是最好的一个季度，甚至是股市历史上最好的季度之一。你对 2025 年第三季度的初步反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Nothing. Nothing could be more validating. All right. So, let's get right into it. Usually, when Adam comes on the stream, he has a lot of things to talk about when it comes to the government business. Again, Palantir's government business four years ago was criticized as being too much of the revenue. And now it is not as much as it was before, but it's almost seen in a more positive light because it's very sticky and given the administration that we have and given the type of margins that Palantir is putting up that government business is not as volatile as commercial, which is actually very nice to have. So narratives have definitely flipped over the past couple years and Adam has been following those narratives. Before we get into all the government stuff, Adam, let's start off with this. We just had I think the single best quarter in the company's history. Arguably one of the best quarters in stock market history. What was your raw reaction to Q3 2025?</p>
</details>

### Palantir 创纪录的季度表现与市场认知

**Adam:** 其实并不意外。有趣的是，在未来五年、七年里，每当我们讨论财报时，我们总会说这是规模最大、表现最好的季度，因为实际上，这就是 Palantir 业务在未来十年复合增长的方式。很多人，特别是新接触 Palantir 的人没有意识到，这是一家有 23 年历史的公司，但在股票市场这个世界里，它还只是一家初创公司。因为在它的历史上，他们只真正专注于政府业务和少数几个机构。当他们上市时，他们说：“好了，现在我们要去占领整个市场。”所以这些数字对于像我、你、Bobcat Gang、以及整个 Palantir 社区的早期持有者来说，真的不应该感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Not really surprising. I mean the funny part is anytime that we have these earning discussions going forward for the next call it five seven years we're always going to say it's the biggest and the best because realistically that's how Palantir's business is going to compound over the next decade. You know, a lot of the stuff that people don't realize, especially if you're new into Palantir, is it's a 23 year old company, but it's only a startup in terms of the stock market world. Because in their history, they only really focused on government and a few of the agencies. When they went public, they're like, "All right, now we're going to go and take the entire market." So these numbers for OG holders like myself, you, Bobcat Gang, everyone in the fellowship, and just in the Palantir community overall, it really shouldn't be surprising.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我认为作为投资者，我们得从两个方面来看待这头五年，因为我们作为一家上市公司已经五年了：前训练营时代和后训练营时代。可以肯定地说，训练营（Boot Camp）——我不想说它拯救了股票或公司，因为它从未真正成为问题——但它完全改变了公司的发展轨迹。现在我们已经有整整 18 个月，也许是两年的训练营经验了，你真的开始看到仅从财报上就体现出的复合增长率。我记得看到前 20 大客户现在的平均花费是 8300 万美元，上个季度大概是 7000 万。所以前 20 大客户的支出在增加。**净收入留存率**（Net Dollar Retention: 衡量现有客户收入增长的关键指标）也开始回升。这个数字对我们来说既重要又不那么重要，因为当他们增加新客户时，会有点扭曲这个数据。但它在上升这个事实本身就是一个非常重要的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: I think as an investor, we kind of have to look at the first five years because now we've been a public company for five years in two folds. The pre-boot camp era and the post boot camp era. It's safe to say that the boot camp, I don't want to say saved the stock or the company because it was never really, you know, an issue, but it completely changed the trajectory of it. And now that we've had what is it, a full 18 months of boot camps at this point, maybe it's two years, you know, you're really starting to see the compounding growth rate just off the earnings. I think I saw the top 20 customers now are spending 83 million. Last quarter that was what, like 70 million. So the top 20 customers are spending more. The net dollar retention is starting to tick back up. That number is kind of important for us, but it's also kind of not important for us because when they add these new customers, it kind of skews the figure. But the fact that it's going up is a very, you know, big sign.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 目前，任何 Palantir 的投资者最应该关注的就是一件事：客户增长。我们的客户数量还没有达到一千。我想我们现在有 911 个客户。是的，911 个。所以，他们还有大量大量的**潜在市场总额**（Total Addressable Market, TAM: 指一个产品或服务在特定市场中的最大可能收入）要去开拓，而且我认为他们不需要两万个客户。我正在看幻灯片，商业客户 530 个，一年前是 321 个，同比增长 65%。总客户数 911 个，一年前是 629 个，同比增长 45%。所以你看到的是商业客户数量的急剧增长，当然政府客户数量也在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And the main thing for any investor for Palantir at the moment should really just be focused on one thing which is customer growth. And we still have not hit a thousand customers. So I think we're at 911 customers. I'm trying to find it in the presentation. 911. Yeah, 911. So, I mean, they still have tons and tons and tons of, you know, TAM to hit and I don't think they're going to need 20,000 customers. And I'm looking at the slide right now, 530 commercial, and from a year ago, they were at 321. So, 65% year-over-year. 911 in total, year ago, it was 629, 45 year-over-year. So you're talking about drastic commercial growth and obviously government growth in the customer count.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 随着这些客户要么留下来（十有八九会），要么增加他们的客户数量，我们将在未来十年看到这些数字变得越来越大、越来越好。因为我们知道，他们的模式是“获取、扩张、规模化”。其中一些客户显然已经过了获取阶段，正在进入扩张阶段。还有一些已经进入规模化阶段。其他的则刚刚触及扩张阶段。所以我们真的开始看到 **S 型曲线**（S-curve: 常用来描述技术或产品生命周期的成长模式）的初期和 alpha 增长。所以，当你在推特上看到那些帖子，比如拿英伟达（Nvidia）作比较——我们当然很高兴他们是客户之一——帖子展示了他们每个季度的收入，从 3 亿、5 亿、6 亿、7.5 亿、8.25 亿一直到 100 亿。你会在不久的将来看到 Palantir 也有这样的帖子。所以这只是时间问题。最重要的事情就是客户增长。财报数据和收益简直好到令人发指。你觉得最亮眼的数据是哪个？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And as these customers either stay on board, which nine times out of 10 they will, and they increase their customer count, we're going to start seeing these figures just keep getting bigger and better and better and better and better over the next decade. Because as we know, acquire, expand, scale, some of these customers, they're already obviously past the acquired phase and they're hitting that expansion phase. And in some of those, they're hitting the scale. Others, they're just touching that expansion phase. So, we're really starting to see the infancy of the S-curve and the alpha growth. So when you see those posts on Twitter of like you know we'll use Nvidia who we are I'm sure very happy about is one of the customers is you know and it shows their revenue per quarter and it's showing like 300 500 600 750 825 blah blah blah blah blah billion 10 billion like you're going to see those posts with Palantir in the near future. So it's just a matter of time. though the most important thing is just the customer growth. The figures and the earnings are just absolutely disgusting in the best possible way. And I mean I don't know what's the most impressive figure. I mean what would you pick?</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我同意。对我来说，财报中最亮眼的部分是营业利润率。能超过 50% 真是太令人兴奋了。因为如果他们能以这样的利润率持续增长，那就意味着每赚一美元就有 50 美分进入底线。这简直是我们见过的最好的商业模式之一。通常软件公司无法达到这种利润率。他们可能会有很高的毛利率，但实际的调整后营业利润或 **GAAP**（Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: 通用会计准则）净利润率却不高，因为要剔除所有费用，得到最终的净利润是很难的。通常会有很多费用，比如人力成本、销售团队。Palantir 不必处理这些，这就是它的优势所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: No, I agree. I mean there were the most impressive part of the earnings to me was the operating margins. I mean for for that to be above 50%. It's getting really exciting because if they can continue that growth with these margins, you're having 50 cents of every dollar come to the bottom line. It's just one of the best business models I think we've ever seen. And usually software companies can't get those types of margins. They'll get good gross margins, but not good actual either adjusted operating income or or GAAP net income margins because it's tough because you got to get rid of all the expenses and get that final piece of dollar at the bottom line. And there's a lot of expenses that come up. Usually headcount usually a Salesforce Palantir doesn't have to deal with that which is why it's very interesting.</p>
</details>

### 解读 Michael Burry 的十亿美元看空头寸

**Amit:** 那么我问你这个问题，然后我们再谈政府业务，因为这个必须得谈。Michael Burry 的十亿美元看跌期权头寸。当你看到这个消息时，你的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Oh let me let me let me ask you this question then we'll get into the government stuff because this is we got to talk about it. Michael Burry billion dollar put position. I mean what was your reaction when you saw that?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我的反应是，他这个头寸的实际价值到底是多少？因为 Jack Prescott 做了一个很好的帖子分析了这件事。他发现，Burry 通常不会这么早公布这些数据，但他这次比平时早了两三周就公布了。所以在我看来，当然我们并不知道确切情况，这也是为什么很多人认为股市被操纵的原因之一，他很可能已经亏损了。也许现在是盈亏平衡。因为如果你还记得，在财报发布当天，股价在盘后交易中一度触及 220 美元，虽然只是短暂的一瞬间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So my reaction was what is he truly at in terms of the value of his position? Because Jack Prescott did a very good post on this. He dug it up. Usually Burry doesn't post these figures until later, but he posted it like I think he did the research like 2 3 weeks before he normally does it. So in my opinion, and granted we don't know and that's the rules of the stock market why many people think it's rigged or manipulated to a degree is he's probably underwater. Maybe now he's break even. Cuz if you remember on the day of earnings, it touched like $220 a share for legitimately like a hot second in the after hours.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** Burry 在那个时候不可能看着股价说“我能在这上面赚钱”。现在他或许可以，我们不清楚，需要更多信息。关于 Burry，以及 Karp 在被问及此事时的采访，关键在于：如果没有电影**《大空头》**（The Big Short: 一部关于2008年金融危机的电影），并且如果他当初没有从那次做空中获利，大多数投资者，尤其是我称之为**金融推特**（FinTwit: 指推特上的金融社区）的那些人，根本不会知道 Michael Burry 是谁。所以我不明白为什么他和 Kathy Wood 会得到这么多关注。好吧，他成功预测了一次崩盘。但他从 2023 年起就一直在预测崩盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: There's no way Burry at that point was looking at that and saying, "I'm going to make money on this." Right now, he might. We don't really know. We need more information. The thing about Burry and definitely Karp's interview where he was being asked about it is this. If you don't have the movie The Big Short, and granted if he never profited off that move to begin with, most investors, especially I'll call them FinTwits, they're not even know who Michael Burry is. So, I don't know why, and I say it also with Kathy Wood, why they get so much attention. Okay, great. He called a crash. He also has been calling for a crash since what, 2023.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 你可以同时是对的也是错的。一个坏掉的时钟一天也能对两次。他就是这样。他已经等了好几年了。当然，从 220 美元跌到现在的 175-180 美元，是的，这是 40 美元的大幅下跌。但你必须记住，对于我们这些早期投资者来说，我们经历过它从 45 美元跌到 6 美元。去年，我和你在这个播客上说：“你认为年底股价会是多少？”我们都说：“哦，可能在 30 到 35 美元左右。”我想，此时此刻，我们对 180 美元的价格会非常满意。如果去年在这一天，当时股价可能是 50 或 60 美元，你告诉我们它会涨到 180 美元，甚至超过 200 美元，我们俩都会笑掉大牙。所以，作为长期持有者，我们绝对是遥遥领先的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: You can be right and be wrong at the same time. A broken clock is right twice a day. And that's what he is. And he's been waiting years. And granted, yeah, 220 to what's the current price? 175, 180. Okay. Yeah, that's a big drop, $40. But you have to remember for OGs, we rode this from $45 to six. And last year, me and you were on this podcast saying, "What do you think the stock price is going to end at?" And we both said, "Oh, maybe around 30 35." I think we'll be very happy being at $180 at this exact moment. If you told us last year on this specific day, I think the stock was 50, maybe 60 bucks. If you told us then, oh, it's going to be at 180 and even cross over 200, we both would have laughed in your face. So, it was definitely we're way ahead of the game as long-term holders.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 当然，如果你是 Palantir 的新投资者，而不是交易者，你可能会想：“好吧，我该怎么办？我为什么要买它？我需要持有多久？”这只股票可能在未来六个月内横盘整理。毫无疑问，它非常昂贵。但是，当你将它与同行比较时，我总是指向 OpenAI。如果 OpenAI 的估值能达到一万亿美元，那么 Palantir 的估值即便达不到一万亿，也至少应该更高，因为 OpenAI 亏损，而 Palantir 盈利。OpenAI 拥有的是 Karp 所说的商品，也就是聊天机器人。而 Palantir 拥有的是操作系统，可以在企业中有效、高效地运用这些商品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Now, granted, if you're a new investor in Palantir and investor, not a trader, you're probably like, "Okay, what do I need to do? Why did I buy it? How long am I going to have to hold it?" The the stock may trade flat for the next six months. You know, it is very expensive. There's no doubt about it. But when you're looking at it compared to its peers, and I always point to Open AI, if Open AI is going to be valued at a trillion dollars, Palantir has to be valued, if not at a trillion, at least more because Open AI loses money. Palantir makes money. OpenAI has a commodity that Karp would say, which is chat. Palantir has the operating system to effectively and efficiently wield said commodity in the correct way in the enterprise.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 如果你用咖啡豆来类比，咖啡豆是一种商品。咖啡店买来咖啡豆，把它磨碎，然后制成咖啡。所以豆子本身价值不大，关键在于你如何利用它。这正是 Palantir 提供的主要价值：提供工具来利用这些 AI 应用，比如 ChatGPT、Grok、Claude 等等。所以，我认为 Burry 公布那个头寸是因为他可能面临追加保证金的通知，不得不出售大量资产来弥补亏损，因为他不仅做空了 Palantir，还做空了英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And if you look at it through like a coffee bean, I don't know why that's coming in my head. A coffee bean is a commodity. The coffee shop buys said coffee bean and they grind it up and they make coffee out of it. So the bean itself is not very valuable. It's how you utilize it and that's the main thing that Palantir is providing the tools to utilize these AI applications such as a ChatGPT a Grok and a Claude insert LLM here. So the Burry position I think he put it out there because he was saying oh crap margin's going to call and I'm gonna have to sell a lot of assets to cover this because he wasn't just shorting Palantir he was shorting Nvidia.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达的合作关系与网络效应

**Adam:** 我不持有英伟达的股票，但显然会关注它，尤其是现在 Palantir 和英伟达建立了合作关系。我会更密切地关注它，因为我们从这次合作中看到的一个主要事情是，Jensen Huang 提到**本体论**（Ontology: 在Palantir的语境中指其核心技术，能将不同来源的数据整合到一个统一的语义模型中）是世界上最重要的技术栈。讽刺的是，早在六月份，DV (Deep Value) 发现了一个非常有趣的合作关系，那就是英伟达和西门子（Siemens）的合作，他们好像是做船坞相关的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Now, I don't own Nvidia. Obviously, I follow Nvidia to a degree, especially now with Palantir and Nvidia partnership. I'm going to be watching it much more closely because one of the main things that we saw through the Nvidia partnership was obviously Jensen mentioning the ontology as the most important stack in the world. Ironically, back in June, DV Deep Value, if you're not following him, he dug up a very interesting partnership, which was Nvidia and Siemens, which was they're in the they're in a I forgot exactly what they do, but they do something with shipyards if I'm not mistaken.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我们在六月份就看到英伟达和西门子在**数字孪生**（Digital Twin: 指物理实体的虚拟模型）模拟方面有合作。现在我们有充分的证据证实他们正在使用 Palantir，也就是英伟达在使用。随着前几周新闻的发布，这已经是板上钉钉的事了。所以我们现在实际上看到了更多的网络效应。本周早些时候，我和 007 发现了关于 HD Hyundai 和西门子在船坞方面合作的文章。很多人需要知道，Palantir 与 HD Hyundai 有一份价值 4500 万美元的合同。这就是西门子和英伟达之间的联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, we actually saw back in June that Nvidia and Siemens had a partnership as it related to this digital twin simulation. Well, if you look it up now, we have full confirmation that they are using Palantir, i.e. being Nvidia. And with the news coming out of the other week, it's guaranteed. So now we're actually seeing more network effects. And earlier in the week, 007 and myself, we found articles about HD Hyundai and Siemens partnering up with the Shipyard. So, a lot of people need to understand those that don't know Palantir has a $45 million contract with HD Hyundai. So, that's the connection between Siemens and Nvidia.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的，而且 HD Hyundai 的业务还会变得更大。因为 HD Hyundai 基本上要打造一个“海洋版 Skywise”（Oceanwise），就像空客（Airbus）通过 Skywise 所做的那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. And that HD Hyundai is going to get even bigger. And if you cuz HD Hyundai is going to build basically what Airbus built via Skywise they're going to build Oceanwise.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以我们关注这件事已经一年多了，就等着 Palantir 和英伟达的官方确认。现在既然已经正式公布，你可以说世界上最有价值的公司英伟达，与世界上最重要的公司 Palantir 联手，将为制造业基础，无论是船舶、芯片、药品还是其他任何东西，打造一个软件工业化的“超级大国”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So we've been watching this pretty much for over a year now just waiting for the official confirmation of Palantir and Nvidia. So now that it's officially out there and you can arguably say that the most valuable company in the world, Nvidia, with the most important company in the world, Palantir together is going to make a quote unquote superpower of software industrialization for the manufacturing base, whether it be for ships, chips, drugs, whatever it might be.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 很多人需要理解的是，随着 Palantir 渗透市场，这将与巨大的客户增长同步发生。当一个客户使用英伟达，然后开始使用 Palantir 的本体论，那么使用和计算所产生的价值就会回流到 Palantir。这才是人们需要看到的核心。即使 Palantir 不是直接的赢家，他们也通过代理方式获胜，因为他们的合作伙伴在使用它。就像上周五我们看到的，Accenture 举办了一个名为“The Forge”的大型活动。我发了视频说，那不是 Palantir 亲自做的，但那是 Accenture 在使用 Foundry，为他们的政府客户提供本体论的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So a lot of people what they need to understand about Palantir and as they're going to penetrate their market and this is going to coincide with that giant customer growth is when a customer is using Nvidia and then they start using the Palantir ontology that dollar amount of usage and compute goes back to Palantir. So that's really the main thing that people need to see is that even if Palantir is not the direct winner, they are winning by proxy because their partner is quote using it. And you kind of saw that this I think it was on Friday we DV and myself posted it. Accenture had that big, you know, big thing called the forge and I post the video like, yeah, that's not Palantir personally, but that's Accenture using Foundry to give their government customers the power of the ontology.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以你有 Burry 在做空这个最有价值的公司。好吧，我能理解。公司市值 5 万亿美元，怎么会有公司值 5 万亿美元？我们不讨论这个。我放一个空头头寸。另一家公司市值半万亿美元，但收入还不到 20 亿美元，我也做空它。你有你的理由，但你被彻底打爆了，这就是为什么你撤回了空头头寸并提前泄露了信息。我们还要几周才能知道结果，如果他因为这次操作最终能盈亏平衡，我一点也不会惊讶。而我的朋友，这正是 Karp 所说的市场操纵，也是为什么很多像你我这样的普通人认为股市是“被操纵的”。因为这些有关系、有深厚财力的大佬们能做这种事并且逍遥法外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So you have Burry shorting literally the most valuable company. Okay, fine. I can understand. All right, the company's worth 5 trillion dollars. How is any company worth 5 trillion dollars? We're not going to get into that. I'm gonna throw a short position. All right, this company is worth a half a trillion dollars. They don't even do $2 billion. I'm going to short that. You have your reasons and you got blown the f up, which is why you pulled your short and you let out that info early and we're not going to know for a couple more weeks. And I wouldn't be surprised if he breaks even now because of this. And that, my friend, is what Karp is talking about market manipulation and why a lot of people like me, you, the average Joe see the stock market as quote rigged because these big boys who have, you know, connections, fat, deep pockets are able to pull this kind of stuff and get away with it.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 更重要的是，如果他们盈利了，如果他们亏损了，什么事都不会发生。即使他们亏损，他们也应该承担后果。就像 Andrew Left 和 Citron，前几天他很高兴地谈论 Karp 出售股票，我不得不指出，请记住你正因市场操纵被 SEC 审判。所以也许你应该让 Alex Karp 的名字远离你的推文。在 50 美元卖出股票，现在股价是 180 美元。你不认为如果他知道，他会继续持有吗？但我们还是让他们自生自灭吧，他们有很多律师费要付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And more importantly, if they profit, if they lose, nothing happens to them. Even if they lose, they deserve to feel consequences. Such as Andrew Left and Citron, who so was so happy to talk about Karp selling his sales the other day that I had to point out that keep them in mind that you're in trial for by the SEC for market manipulation. So maybe you should keep Alex Karp's mouth out of your, you know, tweets out of your mouth because selling shares at 50 and now it's at 180. Don't you think that if he knew he would hold on to it? But we'll let them be. They have a lot of attorneys to pay.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我同意。我百分之万地同意你。Burry 很可能在这个头寸上是亏损的，因为他是在第二季度建立的看跌期权。我们在第二季度达到的最低价是 142 美元，那大概是在八月份，当时 Citron 发布了他们的报告，然后股价几乎立刻反弹到 150 多美元，接着又回到了 170 多美元。所以无论他在什么价位建立空头，当股价在盘后达到 220 美元时，他肯定是亏损的。即使现在是 180 美元，除非他在 160 或 175 美元建的空仓，否则他可能只是盈亏平衡，甚至可能还在亏损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I agree. I also think I 10,000% agree with you. Burry likely was underwater on this position because Q2 is when he initiated the puts. The lowest price we got to in Q2 was 142 and that was like in August when Citron put out their stuff and then it rebounded almost instantaneously up into the 150s and then we got back into the 170s. So at whatever price he initiated the short I mean Palantir was at 220 as you said after hour like he was underwater and still at 180 I mean unless he got that short at 160 175 he's maybe break even maybe a little bit above water he's probably still underwater.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 另一个非常重要的问题，也关系到他为什么提前披露头寸：如果你做空某样东西，你是在寻求 10% 的收益吗？不，你是在寻求彻底的崩溃，对吧？当他做空房地产泡沫时，他寻求的是整个市场的崩溃。所以如果他赌英伟达和 Palantir 会彻底崩溃，我认为你面临的是整个经济崩溃的更大问题。因为英伟达占标普 500 指数的 8%。英伟达不可能在一切安好的情况下单独崩盘。Palantir 是软件领域最大的人工智能公司，如果它下跌 50%，也会引发很多其他问题。所以我认为这实际上是对整个市场的押注，而不仅仅是针对 Palantir 和英伟达。那么问题是，你认为他对整个市场的押注是正确的吗？考虑到这两家公司所展现的执行力，情况并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: And then the other question that's really important about this which is also goes back to why he disclosed the position early is if you're shorting something are you looking for a 10% gain no you're looking for like a full collapse right when he shorted the housing bubble he looked for the entire collapse So if he's betting Nvidia and Palantir will completely collapse, I think you've got a bigger issue with the entire economy collapsing at that point because Nvidia is 8% of the S&P 500. It's not that easy for Nvidia to just fall and everything for be okay. Palantir is the biggest AI name in software for them to fall 50%. You're going to have a lot of other things happen. So I think it's really a bet against the market, not even Palantir and Nvidia. And then the question is, do you think he's right to bet against the entire market? and with the type of execution they're both putting up the case.</p>
</details>

### 理解颠覆性技术的代际鸿沟

**Adam:** 我认为部分问题在于，我不想说这是代际问题，也许更多是经验问题。尤其是在像英伟达和 Palantir 这样的人工智能领域，这些年长的“西装革履”的分析师们，他们从未见过这样的技术，也无法理解它的运作方式以及它将带来的颠覆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: I think part of the issue is and I think it's I don't want to say a generational thing and maybe it's more of a an experience thing is especially in the AI names such as Nvidia and Palantir these older suits and analysts if you will they have never seen a technology like this and they can't comprehend how it works and the disruption it's going to bring.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 像你我这样没有真正接触过软件的人，我们不在西门子、英伟达或房利美工作，日常生活中也不使用这些软件。但我们做了足够的研究，看到了那些确实在使用它、谈论它的人，从而理解即将发生的事情。他们来这里是为了颠覆电子表格。而对于那些思维固化的“西装革履”们来说，他们只认自己的电子表格，这是他们创造价值的方式，这是他们同行的估值水平。他们无法理解英伟达的估值可以达到五万亿美元，而不是像微软或苹果那样，因为后者有 20 年的历史、增长、利润和银行存款。而 Palantir 银行里还有 65 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Now me and you who have not really got to see the software, we don't work for a Siemens or a Nvidia or you know a Fanny Mae and we're not using the software in our everyday lives but we do enough research where we see the people who do use it who talk about it to understand what's coming is they are here to disrupt the spreadsheet and for these suits who are so you know they're just one track mind this is my spreadsheet. This is how I made my value. This is what their peers are trading at. They can't comprehend that a Nvidia can be a five trillion valuation versus a Microsoft or an Apple or whomever who's up there because, you know, they have 20 years of history and all this growth and all this dollar and all this profit, all this money in the bank. And Palantir still has $6.5 billion dollars in the bank.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以，这并不是说 Palantir 只有 2 美元。当然，他们离每季度 250 亿美元的收入还差得很远，甚至还没到 20 亿。但他们无法理解即将到来的变革。我并不怪他们，因为这不容易看清，特别是如果你不花时间去研究。即使你每周工作五天，只花两天时间研究 Palantir、它的客户以及他们发布的所有新闻稿和旧研究，你也很难理解。这就是为什么当你看到 OpenAI 时——我不是故意针对 OpenAI，但他们确实因为很多原因值得被批评——如果他们要估值一万亿美元，并且在未来五年内为 AI 相关服务烧掉 400 多亿美元，而这种 AI 并不能真正帮助像泰森食品或思科这样的公司提高利润，你为什么要给他们一万亿美元的估值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, it's not like they have $2 with Palantir. Obviously, they're not anywhere near, you know, $25 billion a quarter yet. They haven't even touched two billion, but they can't grasp what is coming. And I don't blame them because it's not easy to see it, especially if you don't focus your even if you don't spend two days out of the five days a week of a work week looking at Palantir and their clients and everything that they put out from press releases and other old research that you can look at. you can't comprehend what it's coming at. Which is why when you look at an open AI, and I don't mean to pick on Open AI, but they're they really deserve to be picked on for many reasons, is if they're going to go value at a trillion dollars, and they're going to be in a cash burn and lose 40 billion plus for the next five years for AI related services. And it's AI that's not really going to help bring you, and by you I mean a Tyson Foods or a Cisco or whomever, better bottom line and better profits. Why are you going to give them that trillion dollar valuation?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 而 Palantir 则能帮助公司，无论是陆军、房利美还是国务院，节省资金，提高生产力，并最终给他们带来更多利润，他们可以用这些钱投资新的制造工厂，给员工更多回报，或者投入研发，从而更高效地增加利润。他们看不到也理解不了这一点。我认为部分原因是代际的。我忘了是谁告诉我的，大概在 80 年代，上市公司可能有 900 家左右，现在只有六七百家。一切都变了。当你的估值模型基于电子表格，而一家像 Palantir 这样的公司出现并说“我要终结你的电子表格”时，他们无法理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Whereas Palantir, they're going to help the company, whether that is the Army, a Fanny Mae, the State Department, save money, get be more productive, and ultimately give them more margin where they can either spend that dollar investing in new manufacturing plants, giving employees more dollars back, whether that's through stock options or bonuses, or, you know, just take that money and put it in R&D more towards Palantir and just be more efficient and save and increase your profit and bottom line. They can't see that and understand that. And I just think it's part of it is generational. And I forgot who told me this. I think back in the 80s there was maybe like 900 companies or whatever it was like public or,00 and now there's only like 600 or seven. I forgot what the figure was. So everything is changed and when you're changing on a spreadsheet model and a company comes along like Palantir that's going to say I'm going to end your spreadsheet they can't fathom it and I think that's just part of it.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以从一个正常的角度看，“这家公司赚 5 亿美元，但市值 5000 亿美元，我要做空它”，这在表面上是说得通的。但一旦你开始深入挖掘，看到它的同行估值如何，它的发展轨迹如何，它手头有哪些积压订单，以及未来 36 个月可能有什么新进展，你就无法正确地为它估值。这是一种前所未见、前所未用的颠覆性技术。记住，只有 911 个客户，其中有多少是政府客户？四五百个。所以能去询问、采访和观察的人就更少了，因为你不可能走到陆军面前说：“嘿，你能给我详细解释一下 Maven 智能系统吗？别漏掉任何细节。”他们是不会告诉你的。所以，我祝愿 Burry 和其他做空的“西装革履”们好运。我很乐意接受更多的空头利息，因为我们多头还在买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So from a normal standpoint okay this company makes $500 million but they're worth $500 billion. I'm shorting it on the surface level makes sense. But once you start digging up those rocks and you start seeing okay its peer is worth this but its trajection is this. It's got this in the backlog. Oh and then it might have this coming in 36 months. You can't value it properly. It's a disruptive technology that has never been seen before and never been used before. Remember 911 clients and how many of those are government? Four 500. So, it's even less of people to ask and interview and look and see because you're not going to be able to go up to the army and be like, "So, can you give me an all-in down break of the Maven Smart system and don't leave anything out?" They're not going to tell you that. So, so, you know, I wish Burry and the rest of the suits shorting it much luck. I'll gladly accept more short interest on the stock because bulls, we're buying still.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的，看，我们从股价低于 10 美元时就一直在买。我认为 Burry 没有充分考虑到的另一点是，有很多人就是会一直持有。Palantir 的股价可能从现在下跌 50%，人们仍然会持有他们在 10 美元、20 美元买入的股票。所以，像这样的颠覆性技术让我们所有人都感到谦卑，我们曾觉得股票可能会变得昂贵。是的，我们都知道它很贵，但现在市值已经达到 4000 亿美元，这已经不是散户能主导的了。虽然有很大一部分是早期买入的散户，但你不可能仅靠散户撑起一个半万亿美元的公司。已经有机构投资者进场，他们相信这个故事是真实的，虽然他们不太理解如何估值，但他们愿意参与其中。如果公司继续以现在的水平执行，我认为空头将很难应对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, and look, we've been buying since it was below $10. And that's the other thing I think Burry isn't fully factoring in is you got a lot of people that are just going to hold it. Palantir could fall 50% from here, people are still going to hold the shares that they bought at 10 20 bucks. So, it's just one of those things where I agree disruptive technology like this has humbled all of us that felt, oh, the stock can be get expensive. It's like, yeah, we all know it's expensive, but there's at this point, what 400 billion in market cap? This is not retail. A good chunk of it's retail that you know bought early on but you don't get a half a trillion dollar company all made of retail in that there's institutions that have come in and said we believe this story is real we don't really understand how to value it but we are going to get exposure to it and if they keep executing the way they're executing I think it's going to be hard for the shorts to deal with it.</p>
</details>

### 深度剖析：陆军百亿美元企业协议

**Amit:** 让我们转向政府业务方面。政府业务有很多值得谈论的地方。我想我们直接从这个头条新闻开始。8 月 1 日，Palantir 与陆军签署了一份价值 100 亿美元的企业协议。这涉及到 75 个具体合同，旨在推动更强的数据分析能力。你从 8 月 1 日起就一直在追踪这 75 个合同中的很多，并且对它们有很多见解。我想我们从这里开始，你认为这 75 个合同将包含什么内容？你认为我们应该关注哪些？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: let's transition to the government side of the business. So, there's a lot to talk about in the government business. I think let's get right into this headline. In August 1st, Palantir signed a $10 billion enterprise agreement with the Army. This involved 75 specific contracts for driving essentially more data analysis capabilities. You've been tracking a lot of these 75 contracts for a long time or at least since August 1st and you have a lot of insight into them. I guess let's get started with what do you think these 75 contracts are going to entail and which of the few do you think we should focus on?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 很难给出一个具体的答案，因为这是超过 10 年的协议，而且由于政府关门，我们现在处于 26 财年，谁知道这对 26 财年有什么影响，更不用说对 29 财年的影响了。但是，在这 75 个合同中，我已经找到了大约 11 或 12 个即将到来的项目。其中一些是开放的，不专门针对 Palantir，其他公司也可以提供信息并竞标，但他们拿到的可能性不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: so it's going to be very hard to give an actual concrete answer on this because it's over 10 years and obviously with the government shutdown we are in fiscal year 26 so who knows what that's delaying for the fiscal year 26 never mind what's going to be delayed in fiscal year 29. So, but out of these 75 contracts, about 11 or 12 I found already what's coming. Some of them, you know, they're all open, not specifically to Palantir. They are open for other people to provide information and to bid on, but the likelihood of them getting it unlikely.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我这么说有几个原因。首先，如果陆军不相信 Palantir，或者认为有其他供应商或竞争对手（实际上他们没有）能更好或更便宜地完成任务，他们就不会把这 75 个合同打包并与 Palantir 绑定，而且他们是预测未来 10 年的情况。所以我感觉他们会拿到绝大多数，如果不是全部 75 个的话。有些可能会被取消，有些可能会被整合。也许最终 Palantir 拿到 70 个合同，价值 95 亿美元，我想没人会抱怨说“哦，你没拿到另外 5 个价值 5 亿美元的合同”。他们会拿到大部分的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And I say that for a couple reasons. One, they wouldn't have put these 75 contracts in a bucket and tie it to Palantir unless the Army felt confident that another vendor competitor, which they don't have, can come along, do what they need to do either better or cheaper, and they're forecasting this 10 years out. So, you know, that's why I feel like they they're they're going to get the majority, if not all of the 75. Some might get cancelled, some might get, "All right, we're not going to go forward with this because you could do it through this one and that one." And you know, maybe Palantir at the end of the day, they get 70 contracts at $9 a half billion dollars. I don't think anyone is going to be crying. Well, you didn't get the other five for 500 million. You know what? They're they're going to get the majority of of the money.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 而且你要记住，这是针对陆军及其下属机构的企业协议，不包括海军、空军和太空军。所以，一旦政府重新开放，我不会感到惊讶。因为我记得一月份在你节目上说过，“我们那该死的海军合同在哪儿呢？”是的，Palantir 本应在一月份拿到一个价值 10 亿美元的海军合同，我们在政府网站上看到了，只是还没宣布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And with what's coming, you have to remember that it's an enterprise agreement for the Army and agencies. So this does not include the Navy, the Air Force, the Space Force. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see once the government reopens because I know I said this back on your show in January, we're our godamn Navy deal. So, I wouldn't be surprised because yes, Palantir was supposed to get a1 billion dollar Navy deal back in January and we saw it on the government website. It just hasn't been announced yet.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我认为，虽然可能错得离谱，海军会给 Palantir 一个类似的合同，比如 75 个合同，100 亿美元。甚至空军也可能采取类似的方式。我一点也不会惊讶。海军是行动最慢的。考虑到 Palantir 在商业领域通过西门子、英伟达、HD Hyundai 和 Blue Forge Alliance 所做的事情，他们的核心是造船：如何建造更多船只？如何更快、更高效、更具成本效益地建造？他们不会像洛克希德那样去制造“宙斯盾”驱逐舰。但他们做的是，这是他们最早的合作之一，他们对洛克希德说：“嘿，你有宙斯盾系统（Aegis），我们有阿波罗系统（Apollo）。结合起来，你就能在远洋中将你的所有软件部署到整个舰队。”这就是为什么最早的合作之一是宙斯盾-阿波罗合作。所以，如果看到海军、空军、太空军也签署这类企业协议，我不会感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Correct. So, I am of the mindset and I could be very wrong that the Navy is going to give Palantir the same site, same type of offer, 75 contracts, $10 billion. Maybe even the Air Force takes a shot at it in a similar way. I would not be surprised. The Navy is the slowest one to move and with what Palantir is doing on a commercial side through a Siemens and Nvidia and HD Hyundai and the Blue Forge Alliance, you know, their main thing is ship building. How do we build more ships? How do we do it quicker, more productive, and more cost-effective? They're not going to go in there and start making Aegis destroyers like Lockheed. What they did do though, and this is one of their first partnerships, if you recall, this is many, many moons ago, is that they said to Lockheed, "Hey, you have Aegis, we have Apollo. Together, you're going to be able to deploy all your software across the entire fleet while you're in the middle of the ocean and need to do A, B, C, and D." So that's why one of the first things was the Aegis Apollo partnership. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you see another type of these enterprise agreements with the Navy, with the Air Force, with the Space Force.</p>
</details>

### 新战场：电磁频谱

**Adam:** 现在，关于这个具体的陆军协议，国防部里有很多机构现在是独立的，不属于陆军。比如国防情报系统局（DISA）。去年，Palantir 从 DISA 获得了一个为期一年，价值约 1000 万到 1200 万美元的原型合同，用于电磁战斗管理联合决策支持系统。Amit 知道，我肯定他都听烦了，因为我说了一年多了：频谱时代即将来临，而且我认为频谱业务的价值会非常巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Now, as it relates to this specific one, there's a lot of agencies in the Department of War now that are different that are not part of the army. So, some of them such as the Defense Intelligence System Agency, Dissa. So with Dissa last year, Palantir got awarded a one-year I think it was 10 maybe 12 million prototype for the electromagnetic battle management joint decision support system. So Amit knows and I'm sure he's tired of me saying this because I've been saying this for over a year now. The spectrum is coming and the spectrum I think is going to be big dollars.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 几周前我发过一个帖子，确实有一个电磁战快速集成系统的机会，这个机会与陆军的公开招标有关，而后者又与那 75 个企业协议相连。所以我非常确定，因为那个为期一年的合同已经到期了。但我们在五月份看到一篇文章显示，负责监督此事的 DISA 和战略司令部（Stratcom）——给不熟悉的人解释一下，美国有 11 个作战司令部，所有 11 个都在使用 Maven——Stratcom 和 DISA 发布了一篇文章和新闻稿，基本上说这个系统非常厉害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, and I did post this the other the about a couple weeks ago is they did have out there a electromagnetic warfare rapid integration system opportunity and this opportunity is in connection to the army open solicitations which is connected to the 75 enterprise agreements. So, I'm very I wouldn't be surprised because that one-year deal is passed. But what we saw, I want to say in May is an article that showed that Dissa, who was overseeing this, and Stratcom, that's strategic command. So, for all the people who aren't familiar, I think it is important that you know there's 11 combatant commands. All 11 combatant commands are using Maven, but Stratcom and Dissa put out an article and a press release basically saying this thing works and it is just I'm sorry. I tried my best. 30 minutes is pretty good.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 他们提供的这个电磁战斗管理工具，可以帮助处理电磁频谱。我必须提一下，我最近被一个 Palantir 黑粉的文章引用了。我发了一张战场图片，没加任何背景说明，只写道：“当人们问 Palantir 是做什么的时候，我就给他们看这张图。”那张图是北约（NATO）两年前发布的关于电磁频谱的图片。所以 Palantir 提供的是让作战人员能够“看见”频谱的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So they are they provide this electromagnetic battle management tool to help with the electromagnetic spectrum. And I have to bring it up now that I just go in there is I was quoted in one of the Palantir haters articles, Lauren Ballock, appreciate it. Thank you for the free press. I posted an image of just a battlefield image with no context and I just said when people ask what Palantir does, I'm going to show them this image. That image was I don't know who created it but it was posted by NATO from two years ago about the electromagnetic spectrum. So what Palantir is providing is the tools for the war fighter to see the spectrum.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 很多人不理解，这是非常前沿的东西，连我都没有完全理解到最高层次。现在，当你进入战场，你想看到敌人，你想知道他们的位置，他们有什么装备，十英里外有什么，如果我们移动到这里可能会遇到什么。他们提供的这个工具，能让作战人员看到频谱。这个电磁频谱与 75 个企业协议中的一个合同相结合，可能是一个价值十亿美元的合同。我只是凭空猜测，也可能是 5 亿，我们不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: because what a lot of people don't understand and this is very very advanced stuff and I even I don't understand it to the highest levels is right now when you go into the battlefield you want to see the enemy. You want to be able to see this is where they're positioned. This is what they have. This is what they have 10 miles out. This is what could potentially be coming if we move this position here. Is they provide this tool to allow the war fighter to see the spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum in conjunction with the 75 enterprise agreements through this one contract could potentially be a billion dollar contract. I'm just pulling that out of thin air. It might be 500 million. We don't know.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 关键是要记住，你有一个已经完成的一年期原型合同的机会。而 Stratcom，对于那些不了解的人来说，它可能是最重要的作战司令部，负责监督打击计划、核武库等。所以当他们夏天执行“午夜铁锤”行动，美军向伊朗核设施投掷炸弹时，Stratcom 就参与其中。如果你回去听指挥官们谈论那次打击计划，他们提到了**电子战**（Electronic Warfare, EW），基本上说我们能够神不知鬼不觉地进入敌方领土，完成任务，没有人攻击我们，然后安全返回，没有开一枪，没有人受伤，任务圆满成功。这就是 Palantir 所提供的。所以当人们试图说“哦，他们是做什么的？”时，Palantir 只是提供了工具和资源，来缩短国防领域的“杀伤链”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, the key thing to remember is you have that opportunity with this one-year prototype that has been fulfilled. And Stratcom, for those that don't know, Stratcom is probably I don't want to say the main combatant command, but they're the ones that are overseeing, you know, I'll call it strike packages, the nuclear arsenal, and they are the ones putting it together in the a global scale. So when they did operation midnight hammer over the summer or whenever that was five, six months ago when the US dropped those ordinance bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities, Stratcom is playing a part of that. And if you go back and you listen to the commanders when they talked about the actual strike package, they talked about electronic warfare and they basically said we were able to enter enemy territory unnoticed, come in, do our thing, no one attacked us, did what we need to do and come back home safely with not one bullet fired, no one injured, did successful package, right? So that's what Palantir is providing. So when people try to say like, oh, what do they do? Palantir just provides the tools and the resources to quote shorten the kill chain on the defense side.</p>
</details>

### 揭秘 Palantir 的核心军事产品：Maven、Gaia 和 AIDP

**Adam:** 话虽如此，很多人需要明白，他们有很多产品和服务是不公开的。这就是为什么当 Sham 在上次财报电话会议上提到 Maverick 和 Gaia 时，我非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: With that said, a lot of people need to understand that they have a lot of products and services that aren't very in public, which is why I was very excited when Sham mentioned on the past earnings Maverick and Gaia because Maverick...</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 你能多谈谈这个吗？这些产品某天可能会成为新的 Maven 吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: can you talk can you talk a little bit more about that? What are some of these because these might be the new Mavens of one day essentially?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 嗯，它们肯定不是新的 Maven。首先要明确这一点。Maven 提供的是一个通用作战图景。简单来说，Maven 赋予了武装部队连接传感器和射手的能力，以加快杀伤链。而 Gaia 的作用是，它能安全地集成到作战的各个阶段，提供一个地理空间工具，让分析师和操作员在一个共享的地图界面上工作，用于情报准备、数字任务规划和实时战斗跟踪。这意味着跨任务区域和指挥部的用户可以同时建立一个整体作战计划，对任务和作战环境有共同的理解。基本上，Gaia 能从地理空间网络（比如 Maven）获取数据，将所有这些地图界面和相关信息整合到一个通用作战图景中，供操作员查看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Well, they're definitely not the new Mavens. So, let's just make that clear. So Maven is overall Maven provides a common operating picture. So what Maven would do is I'm trying to simplify it as easy as possible. So Maven provides the armed forces the ability to connect sensors to shooters to quicken that kill chain. So what Gaia what Gaia would do is it securely integrates into all phases of the operation a geospatial a geospatial tooling enable that allows the analyst and the operator to work within a shared map interface for intelligence operation preparation digital mission planning and live battle tracking on top of an integrated data set. The user across the mission enclaves and the command can concurrently build a holistic operation plan with a shared understanding of both mission and operating environment. So what that basically means is Gaia is able to take from a geospatial network i.e. Maven or integrated into Maven, take all these map interfaces with all the information related to it, put it in a common operating picture for the operator and they can see and if you and if you've seen Palantir demos or images, you can see when they do that geospatial stuff where they show the globe and they show the forces, that's Gaia.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 所以你的意思是，它会被集成到 Maven 内部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: that would be like implemented within Maven is what you're saying.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 这就是我想谈谈陆军情报数据平台（Army Intelligence Data Platform, AIDP）的原因。我曾坚信它是通过 Maven 实现的，但事实并非如此。我现在看到的是，有陆军情报数据平台和 Maven 智能系统。AIDP 更倾向于频谱和电磁频谱方面。我们看到操作员同时使用 AIDP（不是 AIP）和 Maven，将它们融合在一起，在一个共享的玻璃面板上看到一切。他们正试图将所有东西整合起来，但这需要时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: This is why I wanted to talk about army intelligence data platform. I was a big believer that it happened through Maven. It doesn't. So right now what I'm seeing is there's Army intelligence data platform and there's the Maven smart system. Army intelligence data platform is more geared toward and maybe I'm wrong on this but it's just because of how I'm researching it is more geared toward the spectrum and the electromagnetic spectrum because what we're seeing is the operators are using both AIDP so not AIP AIDP and Maven to fuse it together and see everything in one shared pane of glass what they're trying to do is is to put everything together. But like I said before, it's new technology. They've never done this before. It takes time.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** AIDP 是一个基于云的平台，旨在统一和简化整个陆军、国防和情报界的请报操作。通过与陆军军事情报旅的密切合作和持续反馈，AIDP 提供了一个高度配置的解决方案，用一个单一的集成环境取代了传统的“烟囱式”系统，为战场领导者提供实时的、可操作的见解，同时大幅降低基础设施成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So just everyone to understand exactly what AIDP is. Army intelligence data platform. It's a cloud-based platform that's designed to unify and streamline intelligence operation across the army defense and intelligence community. So with through close collaboration and continuous feedback from Army Military Intelligence Brigade, AIDP delivers a highly configured solution that replaces legacy stove pipes with a single integrated environment empowering battlefield leaders with real time actionable insights while also dramatically reducing infrastructure costs.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 这也很重要，因为 AIP 是商业端的，Maven 是政府端的。AIDP 可能会成为新的产品，与 Maverick 等许多不同的产品集成，这可能是人们尚未关注到的另一个增长点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. And this is also really important because like AIP is on the commercial side, Maven's on the government side. AIDP might become sort of the new offering that is integrated with a lot of these different Mavericks, etc. And that could be another vector of growth that people are.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 顺便说一下，Maverick 更多地与打击有关，如果我没记错的话，更偏向空军相关的东西。这很有趣，因为我记得两年前就谈过 Maverick。所以当他再次提起时，我心想：“哦，好吧。”他们让这个项目酝酿了一段时间。但看到它发展起来还是很高兴的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Maverick, just for what it's worth, it's it's more related to striking if I'm not mistaken. So, it's more related towards Air Force related stuff because that's what I've been seeing it in. And it's just funny because I firm talk about Maverick like two and a half years ago. So when he brought it up again, I was just like, "Oh, oh, okay." They let it marinate for a while. So, but it's it's nice to see it go.</p>
</details>

### 真实世界的应用：克服 10 分钟的延迟

**Adam:** 我找到了一个很好的例子来说明陆军如何使用 AIDP。在“斯巴达链行动”中，第 34 步兵师的情报指挥官（G2）在一个可扩展的货车里工作，里面有一个地理空间情报工作站。这应该是在 Titan 系统内部。所以情报指挥官在 Titan 里使用 Gaia。车里还有一台情报融合服务器和十个可以访问多个网络应用（如 AIDP、Maven 和 Chat Surfer）的保密网络工作站。所以你看到，在一个 Titan 系统里，一个操作员在使用地理空间工具，另一个在做信息融合，将来自 Gaia、AIDP、Maven 的信息整合起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: But AIDP, and this is to give you a better understanding. And I kind of found a very great article or a couple if you will about how the army is using AIDP and the processes that it's going through. So you have AI and this is this is the military speaking. This is not me. So you have operation Spartan chain and this is where it's all going through. So during Operation Spartan Chain, you had the 34th Infantry Division's deployment with the G2. The G2 are intelligence commanders. The available space inside the expandable van allowed for one geospatial intelligence workstation. So this is also within Titan if I'm not mistaken. So that intelligence commander is in a Titan using Gaia trying to make this all easy. one geoet plotter on an intelligence fusion server and 10 classified network workstations with access to multiple web applications such as AIDP Maven and chat surfer. So you're in a Titan, you have one operator using GeoNet kind of stuff. So they're using Gaia, a meta constellation. Then you have one worker who's working on the fusion part of it. So how do we fuse all this information together from Gaia AIDP Maven Chat surfer looks to be something created by DARPA.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 战术行动中有几个关键阶段。我们关注第三阶段：交战与摧毁。Palantir 参与了所有这些阶段。在第三阶段，当无人机失效后，火力支援部队会利用通过电磁战规划与管理工具和陆军情报数据平台（AIDP）精炼的精确地理定位（Gaia），协调对敌方**无人机系统**（Unmanned Aerial System, UAS）地面控制站的炮击。同时，电子战排继续干扰敌方通信。友军消灭目标，使机动部队能够不受阻碍地前进。所以，就在那个第三阶段，他们正在使用 AIDP 和 EWPMT。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: The critical role of signal intelligence and electronic warfare in tactical operations. And there's about three or four phases. Palantir is involved in all those phases because the operator is seeing everything through a maven smart system or an AIDP. In phase three, engage and destroy with the drone rendered ineffective, the fire support element coordinates an artillery strike on an enemy in a UAS, which is an unmanned aerial, you know, if you will, ground control station, leveraging the precision geoloc, Gaia, refined by enhanced tools like the electromagnetic warfare planning tool and management tool and the army intelligence data platform. Simultaneously, the electronic warfare platoon continues to jam enemies communications, preventing coordinated support or retrograde. Friendly forces neutralize the target, allowing maneuver elements to proceed unimpended. So, right there in that phase three, they're using Army Intelligence Data Platform and EWPMT.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 这就是为什么我之前一直强调**模块化开放系统架构**（Modular Open Systems Approach, MOSA）。很多东西要么是像雷神或洛克希德这样的大型传统承包商已经建好的，要么是新公司需要进入国防生态系统，但缺乏人力、资源或技术。这就是 Palantir 发挥作用的地方。他们能够连接所有这些“烟囱”，创建通用作战图景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: That's why when I first started coming on here, I was very big on MOSA, MOSA, MOSA, MOSA, MOSA, because a lot of the stuff either a has already been built by these big legacy contractors like Raytheon or Lockheed or it's these new guys that have to come into the defense ecosystem, but don't either have the manpower, resources, or the technology to get it all. That's where Palantir comes into play. they're able to connect all the stove pipes and create the common operating picture.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 帮助开发 Maven 智能系统的第 18 空降军会进行演习来完善系统。在今年早些时候的一次演习中，他们发现了一个问题：在陆军情报数据平台（AIDP）和 Maven 智能系统之间传递目标对象时，特别是在目标工作台工具内，存在显著的延迟。这个时间差有多大？通常是 10 分钟。在战场上，10 分钟就是永恒。所以，如果系统现在有 10 分钟的延迟，而它每天都在变得更好、更快、更高效，那么当 10 分钟变成 1 秒钟时会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: The 18th Airborne Corps who helped develop the Maven Smart System, they do these exercises to refine the system. And in one of the older exercises, and it was from earlier this year, they had this part called intelligence support and targeting. regarding systems and their interoperability passing objects between Army Intelligence Data Platform and Maven Smart System specifically within the target workbench tool. So you have was significantly limited during this exercise. The bifurcation of observation and object-based production created a significant time gap. Now how big is this time gap you might be asking? Typically 10 minutes. On the battlefield it's eternity. So, if that's where the system is right now, there's a 10-minute lag, and every day it gets better, faster, more efficient. What happens when 10 minutes becomes 1 second?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 这就是为什么 Maven 还是一个原型。数据在进入 Gaia（第四个产品）之前有 10 分钟的延迟。这种延迟限制了第 18 空降军进行动态目标打击的能力。他们发现，之前用于建立目标包的 PowerPoint 幻灯片已经过时了。这就是为什么分析师们无法理解。电子表格完蛋了，PowerPoint 也完蛋了，它们都是恐龙，正在灭绝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: That's why Maven is a prototype because you're having these gaps. Now, I'm going to finish reading my little thing before the data populated into Gaia, fourth product. So, there's a 10-minute gap before it goes into Gaia. This time gap caused by cascading effects that restricted the 18th Airborne Corp's ability to conduct dynamic targeting, especially in the fast-paced large-scale combat operation environment. This would allow the analysts and targeters to gain efficiencies by associating information and intelligence to the objects to build the target pack in AIDP instead of previously used PowerPoint slide deck. So, take your PowerPoint, print it out, wipe your ass with it. It's done. It's over. It's gone. It's a dinosaur. Goodbye. This is why the analysts can't get it. Spreadsheets, it's done. PowerPoints, it's done. It's a dinosaur. It's going extinct.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 不幸的是，目标信息无法传递到 Maven 智能系统。这个限制迫使 G2 团队几乎完全在 Maven 智能系统上操作。所以你现在开始理解为什么 Maven 如此重要，以及为什么它仍处于原型阶段。这次演习大概是今年四五月份。所以明年报告出来时，也许 10 分钟变成了 5 分钟，也许是 2 分钟。但在国防领域，别说 10 分钟，10 秒钟都可能决定生死。这就是为什么他们还没有授予 Maven 一个正式的“记录在案项目”（Program of Record）资格。他们还在解决问题，还在计算成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Unfortunately, the target information cannot be passed to the Maven Smart System. The limitation forced the 18th Airborne Corpse G2s getting team to operate on Maven Smart System almost exclusively to support the fires and to use target workbench residing in Maven smart system. So now you're starting to see and understand why Maven is so important and why it's still in prototype stage. This exercise I think was in May or April of this year. So next year when the report comes out maybe 10 minutes is 5 minutes maybe it's 2 minutes I don't know but this is why Maven is so critical to the armed forces and still in prototype stage because in defense context never mind 10 minutes 10 seconds can be the difference between life or death so that's why they haven't awarded Maven a fullon official program of record. They're still working out the quirks. They're still working out the cost.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 这次演习为情报官员提供了一个关键机会，让他们就问题提供反馈，并直接与 AIDP 的代表合作，开始调查并寻找解决方案。这意味着什么？Palantir 的**前线部署工程师**（Forward Deployed Engineers, FDEs）被告知：“伙计，这东西会害死我们，除非你们让它更快、更高效。”我们无法完成这个，也就是 **OODA 循环**（Observe, Orient, Decide, Act: 观察、判断、决策、行动循环，一个军事策略概念）。他们需要让一切尽可能快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Nevertheless, it provided a key opportunity for the intelligence officers to provide feedback on the issue and work directly with AIDP representatives, begin an investigation and a solution. What does that mean? Palantir FDEs were told, "Dude, this thing is going to get us killed unless you make it quicker and more efficient." We weren't able to do this, which is the OODA loop. And Sham even mentioned, I know that was like one of the first things I shared on this stream with you and your followers was the OODA loop. They need to make everything as quick as possible.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 你开始看到，Maven 并不完美，但它已经遥遥领先。五年后，当原型完成时，也许它会从一个五年 4.8 亿美元的原型项目，变成一个五年 50 亿美元的正式记录在案项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, you're starting to see now that Maven's not perfect. It's not, but it's so far ahead of the game that in five years when the prototype is done, and we don't know the NATO deal, we don't that it will become maybe instead of a five-year, $480 million prototype, it will become a five-year $5 billion official program of record.</p>
</details>

### 未来战争的形态：乌克兰的经验与 JADC2

**Amit:** 你认为 Karp 和波兰国防部的交易，是因为 Maven 在北约的应用吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: do you think Karp and the Ministry of Defense in Poland made a deal because of what's going on with Maven with NATO as well?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我不认为完全是因为 Maven，我认为是因为过去几年在俄罗斯和乌克兰发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: I don't think it was specifically quote because of Maven. I think it's because of what has gone on in Russia Ukraine over the past couple years.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 很多人问我，Maven 和 **JADC2**（Joint All-Domain Command and Control: 联合全域指挥与控制，是美国国防部提出的一个概念，旨在将所有军种的传感器连接到一个网络中）是什么关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: a lot of people have been asking me, you know, and maybe for you this might be a little bit rookie because me and you have talked so much about it over the years, you know, what is Maven and what is JADC2?</p>
</details>

**Adam:** JADC2 是一个愿景，旨在连接传感器和射手以缩短杀伤链。Maven 是实现这一愿景的一部分，它将武装部队带向 JADC2 作战部队。所以当你看到像波兰这样的国家签署这样的协议时，是因为他们看到了乌克兰用一支规模小得多的军队抵御了俄罗斯军队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, JADC2 is joint domain command and control. It's basically to connect the sensors and shooters to quicken the kill chain. It's just a vision. Maven is part of that vision to bring the armed forces to a JADC2, you know, fighting force. So when you see countries like Poland signing deals like this, it's because they have seen Ukraine fight off the Russian army using a a significantly smaller army.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 乌克兰人在无人机战和电磁战方面非常出色，因为俄罗斯人精于电子战。他们已经将他们的战斗部队激励机制变成了一种《使命召唤》式的策略，通过一个“公司商店”。如果你杀死 10 个俄罗斯人并能证明，你就可以去 Bravo One 公司商店——很可能是建立在 Palantir 上的——换取更好的无人机和装备。他们简直是在玩真人版《使命召唤》：“哦，你升级了，现在可以得到这个新枪械皮肤，这个更好的无人机。”这激励他们去创造更好的东西，因为如果你想在散兵坑里活下来，你需要最好的装备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: because the Ukrainians are so good at drone warfare and electromagnetic, because the Russians are really good at electronic warfare that they're becoming so good at it, they have incentivized their fighting force through a call of duty strategy via the company store. So if you go and you kill 10 Russians and you can prove that you can go to the Bravo One company store built on Palantir most likely and you can get better drones, better equipment. So they're literally doing Call of Duty style like, "Oh, you ranked up now you get this new gun skin now you get this better drone." And this is incentivizing them to actually go out there and build better stuff, right? Do this, do that, because if you want to survive in that foxhole, you need the best possible equipment.</p>
</details>

### 下一代指挥与控制系统 (NGC2)

**Adam:** 这让我回到了 75 个合同中的另一个项目，也就是我们的好朋友们一直在批评的 NGC2 战斗系统，即下一代指挥与控制系统。大约一周半前，我看到了一个很棒的视频，他们正在使用这个系统，我截了图，你可以看到链接里有 palantir.gov。这太棒了，得到了验证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Which brings me back to more 75, which is our good friends who were hating on the NGC2 battle system, next command and control system, which as you saw, I posted this about maybe a week and a half ago. I saw this great video of them using it and I took a screenshot and you could see it has palunteer.gov in the link. You might want to pull that up. It was so awesome. Just getting validation.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的，这也正是路透社一个月前那场争议的起因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yes. Well, this is also what caused the Reuters controversy a month ago.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 没错。路透社的那篇文章说系统效率低下，运行不畅。问题是，他们引用的是一次早已过时的旧演习。而在一周前，我刚发了一篇文章，谈到他们正在进行一次演习，使用这个系统来部署射手。这正是 JADC2 的核心：连接传感器和射手，缩短杀伤链。所以他们正在这个 NGC2 网络上操作，这个网络包含了 Anduril 和 Palantir 的组件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: Exactly. So with the NGC2 that Reuters came out, they basically said there was inefficiencies and things weren't working well. The problem is they were citing an old old exercise that was already outdated. And a week before this, I posted an article talking about how they were doing an exercise where they were using this system, that link that you're looking at right there, to deploy shooters. And that's the whole point of JADC2 is to connect the sensors to shooters to quicken the kill chain. So they're going on to this NGC2 network which has components of Anduril and components of Palantir as well as others.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 他们正在完善 NGC2，让它更快、更好、更高效、更便宜。然后你就得到了这样的机会，比如陆军应用实验室的解决方案征集，这是 75 个合同的一部分。我怎么知道 Palantir 会拿到这个？因为它特别提到了第四步兵师。第四步兵师是专门用于测试 NGC2、Maven 和其他 Palantir 正在开发的先进技术的关键部队之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, what they're doing with this NGC2 is they're refining it, making it quicker, better, more efficient, cheaper, and you get an opportunity like this, which is the calls for solutions army applications lab, which is part of the 75. And how do I know Palantir is going to get this? because it is specifically mentioning the fourth infantry. Now the fourth infantry is one of the key infantry groups that is specifically being tested for NGC2 Maven and these other advanced technologies that Palantir and others are building.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 陆军未来司令部正在为驻扎在科罗拉多州的第四步兵师寻找创新的、现成的解决方案，将于 2026 年初使用。这些解决方案应能够与士兵在野外进行扩展实验，并应开放与下一代指挥与控制（NGC2）Palantir 原型生态系统集成。他们提到了八个重点领域，比如机动与调遣（这基本上就是 Titan），任务指挥（这是 NGC2 和 Palantir），情报（传感器网络），侦察与目标捕获（AIDP 和 Maven），火力（无人机蜂群），以及维持（自主车队）等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, the Army Future Command is seeking innovative, readily available solutions for use of the Fourth Infantry Division based in Colorado, by the way, at the beginning of the calendar year of 2026. These solutions should be capable of extending experimentation with soldiers in the field focused on at least one of eight capabilities focused areas listed in section C. They should be open to integration with the next generation command and control palunteer prototype ecosystem that the program executive office command control and communication network is developing over the next 18 months within the fourth infantry. So these are the eight that they mentioned. movement and maneuver unmanned or improved security tech safety and security of operation including route mine clearance breaching bunker trench blah blah blah blah blah. So that right there basically is Titan. mission command, that's tools that process the data, that's your NGC2, that's Palantir, your intelligence, loitering capabilities and sensor network. Palantir has a sensor intelligence platform. Reconnaissance and targeting acquisition, that's going to be your AIDP and Maven. Your fires, your drone swarm or sensor to soldier systems that aid in target acquisition, that's going to be your AIDP and your target pack that we just discussed. Your sustainment, that's autonomous, convoy, aerial, and ground resupply capabilities.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 还有健康工具，这非常酷。他们希望能够部署一个自主系统，一个机器人，去到受伤的士兵那里，并由机器人自己来止血。因为他们说，从士兵倒下到被送到医疗点的时间，在某些战场可能长达 8 到 12 分钟。如果你在失血，八分钟是很长的时间。这些软件很可能会在 Palantir 上进行训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: And health tools, and that's really cool. the health tools. I found one that's actually I don't want to get deep into it because I have to do a lot more digging, but it's called NASH. And basically what they want to be able to do is if you're a soldier and you got shot and you're bleeding in your arm or your leg, they want to be able to deploy an autonomous system, a robot, and maybe it's an Optimus or a figure robot if they can get there, go to the soldier, and stop the bleeding the the robot itself. And they're trying to do that because I think I forgot where it was that I read it that they said the time from, you know, soldier down to like actually brought to like the medical, I think they said it was about like in Israel they said it was like 3 to 5 minutes, but granted it's a lot smaller space. I think they said like out in the Indo-Pacific or if in another battlefield space it's like 8 to 12 minutes if you're losing blood eight minutes is a long time. So that right but they're going to be hopefully training that software on Palantir.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 还有信息安全，即可以扫描和检测网络漏洞、自动监控虚假信息的工具。我们前几周就看到一个例子，一个流氓军官做了一些不该做的事，他被抓住了。他是怎么被抓住的？因为 Palantir 提供的系统，如果你滥用权力，会留下审计追踪，你的上级可以看到。所以这个人毁掉了自己的人生，全因为这个系统内置了这些功能来检测漏洞，确保你不能获取你不该获取的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: and information is tools that can scan to detect for network vulnerabilities, automated monitoring of disinformation. Doc Gang and myself, we actually saw something the other week and we never published it, but there was a I'll call it a rogue officer, if you will. He was doing stuff that he shouldn't have been doing and he got caught and they dismissed him. How did he get caught? Because Palantir provides the system where if you abuse your power, there's an audit trail and the person above you can see that. So this person thought he was so cool doing his thing, obviously not doing what he was supposed to be doing and he just ruined his life. All because the system is built with these kinds of capabilities and vulnerabilities or to detect said vulnerabilities so that you can't take information away if you're not supposed to or get information if you don't have this permit or this level of access.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以当 Karp 谈到 3 万亿美元市值和 5 年内 10 倍增长时，就是通过这些系统和工具实现的。因为山姆大叔是全世界最大的消费者。一旦这些系统完善到他们需要的程度，他们就会得到报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So when Karp's talking about I forgot if it was the CNBC interview or the or not not the Axios one, the CNBC one or another one, but he said three trillion and 10x. There were two different interviews. so when he's talking about $3 trillion market cap and a 10x in 5 years from here, this is how it's these systems. It's these tools because Uncle Sam is the biggest spender in the entire world. And once these systems get flushed out and to the exact point where they need it to be, they're going to get paid.</p>
</details>

### 长期愿景：怀疑论者错过了什么

**Amit:** 人们就是不知道即将发生什么，对吧？这就是为什么你会看到那些分析师现在把我们的目标价从 45 美元调到 50 美元。他们看不到即将发生的事情。你对大家有什么信息？关于你认为未来会发生什么，Palantir 知道未来会发生什么，但有些人仍然持怀疑态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: people just don't know what's coming, right? And that's where you get the suits and the analysts and the rishies that now have us at a $50 target instead of 45. So, thanks Rishi for that. They don't see what's coming. What is your message to everyone about what you think is coming in the future, what Palantir knows is coming in the future, but what some people still are too skeptical to really see playing out.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 我从政府的角度来回答这个问题，因为那是我主要关注的领域，也是山姆大叔花钱最多的地方。我用国务院举个例子。去年八月我上你的节目谈论一个人工智能解决方案，我知道他们会赢，因为他们是唯一合理的选择。后来我们知道这是为国务院做的，他们拿到了一份一年 4.2 亿美元的合同。当这一年结束时，会发生什么？他们很可能会得到一个更大的合同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, I'll answer that from a government context. Because that's mostly where I focus on and that's where Uncle Sam spends the most. And I'll use the State Department as an example. I came on your show last year in August to talk about this artificial intelligence solution that I knew they were going to win because they were the only ones that made sense and it was for the State Department we learned and they got a one-year $420 million contract in that when that one year ends. What's going to happen? They're going to get a bigger contract most likely.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以，如果你看不清未来，就看看你的政府。从国税局到退伍军人事务部，再到国务院和国防部，所有这些部门都将运行在人工智能之上。如果他们要使用像 ChatGPT 或 Gork 这样的 AI，就必须有一个操作系统来确保它不会产生幻觉，并且被有效、正确地使用。那就是本体论，那就是 Palantir。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So when you can't see what's coming, just look at your government. From the IRS to the VA to the State Department to the Department of War, all of them are going to be running on AI. Now, if they're going to be using AI, such as Chat GPT, Gac, insert AI application LLM here, there has to be an operating system to make sure that it doesn't hallucinate and it's used effectively and correctly. and without providing the wrong answer. That's the ontology. That's Palantir.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 所以，如果你不知道未来走向何方，我推荐几件事。关注我和 Bobcat Gang，你会有一个很好的了解。或者就去读他们发布的东西，无论是 Palantir 还是山姆大叔。因为即使他们是一家政治性公司，他们现在也处在一个非常政治化的世界里。无论执政的是共和党还是民主党，这个系统都会存在，因为没人能做他们所做的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So, if you don't know where it's going, I recommend a couple things. Follow myself and Bobcat Gang because you'll get a very good idea. Or just read what they put out there, both Palantir and Uncle Sam, because even though they are, I'll call it a a political company. They are in a very political world right now. It doesn't matter if it's Republican, Democrat running the show. The system is going to be there regardless because no one can do what they can do.</p>
</details>

**Adam:** 比如五角大楼三个月前发布了一份备忘录，他们希望在未来六到九个月内让三百万台电脑运行人工智能。如果五角大楼希望三百万台电脑运行 AI 应用，那就意味着有三百万个操作员在使用 Palantir。他们当然也会使用 OpenAI、Grok 或其他尚未出现的 LLM。但关键是，人工智能和机器学习的操作系统是 Palantir，是 Foundry。所以在政府领域，你会看到美国、西方及其盟友的巨大扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam: So the Pentagon for example, they put out a memo about three months ago that they want AI running on three million computers in the next six to nine months. That was three months ago. So if the Pentagon wants three million computers running AI applications, that's 3 million operators using Palantir. Now, will they also use an OpenAI? I'm sure they will. I'm sure they'll also use Grock. I'm sure they'll also use some other LLM that has not come along yet that we have no idea that no one's even thought of. But the point is the operating system for artificial intelligence and machine learning is Palantir. It's foundry. So in the government context, you're just going to see massive expansion from both the United States and the West and their allies.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的，我认为对我们所有人来说，这是一个“幸福的烦恼”。我们都曾觉得到 2030 年 Palantir 的股价会到 100 美元，我们会在拉斯维加斯开个大派对。因为我们在 2022 年看到它只有 6 美元。所以我们想，好吧，八年时间大概能到 100，也许 150。结果两年半就到了 100，八个月后又到了 200。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. Yeah. And I think for all of us it's been it's been a it's been a good problem to have, but it is indeed a problem. All of us felt that in 2030 Palantir would be $100 and we'd have a big party in Vegas because we saw it at $6 in 22. So we're like, all right, over eight years it'll probably get to 100, maybe 150. We'll have a party. We got to 100 in two and a half years. And then we got to 200 eight months later.</p>

**Amit:** 所以对我们来说，我们知道我们在 2022 年熊市深处发现的故事，现在已经被全世界发现了。然后世界的一部分人说，这个故事不足以支撑它提前兑现所有增长和溢价。我们承认，是的，他们提前兑现了很多增长和溢价。但正如你所说，这个故事在不断演变，公司的执行力达到了我们前所未见的水平。股票当然很贵，但如果你过分关注股票而忽略了故事本身——而故事才是股票最终能成长到与其估值相符并继续扩张的关键——你就会错过它。我认为这就是我们所有人必须处理的微妙之处：股票已经远远赶上了公司的表现，但公司的表现仍然如此出色，以至于从长远来看，股票仍有更多的上涨空间，但你必须有真正的长远眼光。

<p class="english-text">Amit: So, so for us it's we know that the story that we found in in the in the depths of the bare market in 2022 has now been discovered by the world and then you have this faction of the world saying that story is not good enough for it to be pulling forward all that growth and all that premium and we're acknowledging like yeah they're pulling forward a lot of growth and premium but as you said this story is evolving the company is executing at a level we haven't seen before and obviously the stock is expensive but if you care too much about the stock and not the story which is what really matters for the stock to eventually grow into its valuation and continue to expand its multiple and get to that three trillion as Carp is talking about, you're going to miss it. And I think that's the nuance all of us have had to deal with, which is that the stock has vastly caught up to the performance of the company, but the performance of the company is still so good that the stock still has more room to run over the long term, but you have to really have a long-term view.</p>

**Adam:** 当然。我和 fellowship 里的每个人从 DPO 开始关注 Palantir 时就一直说，504 美元是不可避免的。它会到来，并最终超过 504。我爱国一点，就说 1776 美元吧。所以，如果你相信这家公司，就继续逢低买入并持有，它会实现它声称要做的。

<p class="english-text">Adam: Absolutely. and myself and everyone in the fellowship since we've been following Palantir since DPO. We've always said 504 504 is inevitable. It's going to come and eventually it'll go past 504 and I'll just be patriotic and say 1776. So, you know, just keep buying dips and holding if you believe in the company and it's going to hit what it claims it's going to do.</p>

**Adam:** 疯狂的是，欧洲在这方面还是个滞后者。我们会看到世界其他地区（美国以外）的巨大增长。但我认为一旦欧洲赶上——他们正在从政府层面赶上，通过北约和各种政府项目——当商业领域开始采用时，事情就会变得非常刺激，那可能要到 2030 年代才会发生。但就像你说的，这是一个漫长的故事，他们正在取得巨大成就。你不能没有 Palantir 就拥有可工作的、真实的、高效的人工智能。

<p class="english-text">Adam: And the crazy part about it is Europe is such a I don't want to use the word black hole, but there's such a lagger in this that we will see massive growth from other parts of the world outside of the US. But I think once Europe catches up, because they're catching up from a government perspective, like it's going to all come in through NATO and government like we see with MHS, NATO, and all these other programs. Once the commercial starts to adopt it, that's when things are going to get real spicy and that's probably not going to come till the 2030s from outside the US. But like you said, it's just a long story and they are accomplishing so much. And think about it like this. They can only do X in 24 hours. So it's one day at a time and they are hitting on all cylinders. And they are set out to really revolutionize the Western world. And I truly believe they're going to do it. You cannot have working, truthful, efficient AI without Palantir.</p>

**Amit:** 我同意。他们为了这一刻已经工作了 20 年，通过本体论——这些 LLM 的编排系统。然后正如你所说，还有大量的国际收入尚未实现，而这即将到来。当这一切与美国商业的增长相结合时，这真的可能成为市场历史上最好的故事之一。

<p class="english-text">Amit: I agree. and they've been working 20 years for this moment via the ontology which is the orchestration of these LLMs and then as you said there's a lot of international revenue that is yet to be achieved yet and that's coming and when that comes along with how US commercial is growing it really is the story that could be one of the best stories in the history of the market</p>

**Adam:** 而我和你将一路见证。

**Amit:** 我喜欢这个。Adam，非常感谢你。聊天区里有他的推特链接。感谢 Adam、DV、Bobcat gang，你们在过去几年里对这个故事的贡献是无价的。感觉像是十年，其实是四五年。但到 2030 年，当我们再做这样的直播时，回想 2025 年我们讨论 2030 年的军队会是什么样子，那会很疯狂。就像现在回忆 2022 年，事情已经发展了这么多。这真的是我们一生中最棒的旅程之一。

<p class="english-text">Amit: I love it Adam thank you so much there's his Twitter right there in the chat shout out Adam DV Bobcat gang you you guys have been absolutely invaluable to this story over the past 10 years or really it feels like 10 years really four or five years. Um but in 2030 when we're doing another stream like this it's going to be crazy to know that in 2025 we were talking about what the army of 2030 looks like and then it's I mean just like even reminiscing on 2022 and how far things have progressed. It really is just been one of the best journeys of our entire lives</p>
