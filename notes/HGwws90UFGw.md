### 加拿大医疗系统的挑战与展望

每个人都同意，加拿大需要更多的**全科医生**（General Practitioners: 提供初级医疗服务的医生），医院的等待时间需要缩短，并且人们在需要时应该能够获得适当的护理。但我们如何才能实现这一目标呢？我们从**弗雷泽研究所**（Fraser Institute: 加拿大一家公共政策智库）健康政策主任 Nadeem Ismail 和**多伦多大学**（University of Toronto）家庭与社区医学系主任 Aniello Martin 博士那里获得了见解。Nadeem、Martin 博士，非常感谢你们参加我们的节目。让我们首先从整体上谈谈我们的医疗系统。我可以假设你们两位都同意这个系统并不完美，有些地方需要改进。但是 Martin 博士，我们先从您开始，我们的医疗系统有哪些方面是运作良好的呢？

<p class="english-text">Everyone agrees that Canada needs more GPs, that hospital wait times need to come down, and that people should have access to the right kind of care when they need it. But how do we get there? I got insight from Nadeem Ismail, director of health policy at the Fraser Institute and Dr. Aniello Martin, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto. Nadeem, Dr. Martin, thank you so much for joining us on the program. Let's start with our health care system in general. We can I can assume that both of you can agree that this system is not perfect. There are things that need to be fixed. But Dr. Martin, let's start with you. What what is working in our health care system?</p>
</details>

### 加拿大医疗系统的优势

**Dr. Martin:** 首先值得注意的是，加拿大人作为一个群体来说，实际上相当健康。与平均水平相比，我们寿命较长。在加拿大，当你病得很重时，你确实能得到极好的护理。加拿大人因中风住院死亡率较低。我们在癌症和心脏护理方面取得了优异的成果。当然，我们所有人都享有一套核心服务的覆盖，即医生和医院服务，而无需为此付费，这意味着一旦你进入系统，就能获得良好的公平可及性。因此，作为一个相当健康的群体，我们有很多值得庆祝和自豪的地方。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, the first thing that's worth noting is that Canadians are actually quite healthy as a group. We live a long time compared to the average. And when you get really sick in Canada, you actually get terrific care. Canadians have lower rates of dying in hospital from stroke. We have excellent outcomes for cancer and cardiac care. And of course, we're covered, all of us for a core set of services, doctor and hospital services without having to to pay for those services, which means that we have good equity of access when you can get into the system. And so there there's lots to celebrate and lots to be proud of as a pretty healthy bunch.</p>
</details>

Nadeem，在我们的医疗系统中，有哪些积极方面让您印象深刻？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nadeem, what positive aspects stick out to you in our health care system?</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 这是一个充满训练有素的专业人员的医疗系统，他们正在尽力为患者服务。当然，当我们面对非常危急的状况时，我们看到了结果。加拿大医疗系统在将人们从死亡边缘拉回来方面做得相当好。我认为，一些结果无疑是相当积极的。因此，在许多方面，这是一个积极的系统，而且我们的支出记录非常高，这不一定是坏事。它表明了对高质量医疗系统的高度承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a health care system full of highly trained professionals who are doing their best for patients. Certainly we see it on the outcome side when when you're going in with a very critical condition. The Canadian health care system is actually fairly good at dragging people back from the brink of death. And I think certainly some of the outcomes are quite positive. So in many ways, a positive system, and we do have a very high spending record, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It shows a very high level of commitment to a high quality health care system.</p>
</details>

### 医疗可及性与等待时间问题

好的。我们之前提到的**C.D. Howe报告**（C.D. Howe Institute: 加拿大一家独立研究机构发布的报告）指出，加拿大在医疗可及性方面排名非常靠后，在十个国家中排名第九。当我们谈论医疗可及性时，它又细分为可负担性和及时性。Martin 博士，为什么加拿大在医疗可及性方面如此落后？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. The C.D. Howe report that we referenced earlier says that Canada ranks very poorly, nine out of ten in access to care. When we talk about access to care, that is broken down into a subcategory of affordability and timeliness. Dr. Martin, why is Canada so behind when it comes to access to care?</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 好的，让我们谈谈可负担性，因为我认为这对许多人来说并不直观。现实情况是，虽然我们在医生和医院服务方面有很好的覆盖，但在其他所有服务的覆盖方面，我们都落后于其他国家。因此，在我的诊所里，我经常看到那些没有处方药、心理健康服务或物理治疗覆盖的人。所以，可负担性问题就出现在了对许多现代医学关键服务的覆盖广度不足上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's talk about affordability, because that's one that I think for many people is not intuitive. And the reality is actually that while we have very good coverage for physician and hospital services, we have lagged behind other countries in terms of our coverage of everything else. So in my practice, it is common for me to see people who don't have any coverage for their prescription medication, who don't have coverage for mental health services, who don't have coverage for physiotherapy. And so this question of affordability crops up in the lack of of breadth of coverage for a whole lot of services that are critical part of modern medicine.</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 当然，我们必须记住，加拿大人在发达国家中拥有最长的医疗服务等待名单，尽管我们在发达国家中的医疗支出也是最高的之一。所以我们花了很多钱，但等待时间却是发达国家中最差的，等待时间年复一年地创下新高。而且高额支出当然也限制了我们做其他事情的能力。所以，我认为很容易指出政府做得不够。但现实是，政府在很多方面都做得非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have to remember, of course, that Canadians have some of the longest waiting lists for access to health care in the developed world, in spite of the fact that we have some of the highest health spending in the developed world. So we're spending a great deal of money, and yet we have some of the worst waiting times in the developed world, wait times that reach a record length year after year. And that high spending constrains our ability, of course, to do other things. So I think it's easy to point to say government's not doing enough. But the reality is government is doing a lot of things very wrong.</p>
</details>

我们正在谈论哪些其他国家？我们正在与谁进行比较？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What other countries are we talking about? Who are we comparing ourselves to?</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 好的，让我们看看其他拥有全民医疗保健系统的发达国家，比如荷兰、德国、瑞士，它们在初级护理、急诊护理、专科护理和择期手术方面都有很好的可及性，这些领域的等待时间都比加拿大短得多。甚至还有一些国家，它们的支出比我们少得多，但做得更好，比如澳大利亚，它们的等待时间更短，支出水平也更低。所以，加拿大拥有全民医疗保健系统并非独一无二，但我们在经历如此漫长的等待时间方面却是独一无二的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's look at other developed nations with universal access healthcare systems the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland where they have very good access to primary care, to emergency care, to specialist care, to an elective surgery, shorter waiting times in each of those areas, much shorter than Canada is. But even other nations that spend a lot less than we do and do better, like Australia, where they have shorter wait times and a lower level of spending. So it's not-- Canada is not unique in having a universal health care system, but we are unique in having this incredibly long wait times experience.</p>
</details>

### 国际比较与私营部门的角色

Martin 博士，让我们谈谈我们医疗系统的其他方面。在与这些其他国家竞争方面，我们有哪些领域是落后的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Martin, let's talk a little bit about other aspects of our health care system. What areas do we look at that are holding us back in terms of competing with some of those other nations?</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 嗯，我认为 Nadeem 和我可能在这个问题上达成一致的少数领域之一是，即使在我们拥有这些训练有素的专业人员的领域，等待时间也常常很长，因为我们没有很好地协调我们所拥有的资源。所以，你知道，当我在我的诊所里看到一个需要髋关节或膝关节置换的病人时，我几乎无法知道谁能最快地接诊这位病人。我们没有一个协调的系统，让人们能够找到他们所在地区下一个可用的医疗提供者。因此，我们发现，不仅等待时间普遍较长，而且地区之间差异很大。你知道，甚至在每个省和地区内部也是如此。所以，我们可以做很多事情来更好地协调这些服务，以便当确定一个人需要看神经科医生时，例如，他们能获得他们所在地区下一个可用的神经科医生在方便地点的下一个可用预约，并且能够处理他们的问题。在 Nadeem 提到的一些国家，甚至在加拿大的一些服务中，都有很多这样的例子。例如，我们在安大略省的癌症护理系统中看到，我不会将我的病人转介给某个**放射肿瘤学家**（Radiation Oncologist: 专门使用放射疗法治疗癌症的医生），当他们被新诊断出癌症时，他们会在区域癌症中心由下一个可用的专家接诊，该专家可以处理那种形式的癌症。所以这些事情都是集中化的。心脏护理也是如此。你知道，人们不会等待看某个特定的人。他们会被放入一个共同的队列中，并由下一个可用的提供者接诊。实际上，这些系统正是我们成果最好、等待时间最短的一些系统。所以，即使在我们开始谈论花费更多金钱（无论是公共资金还是私人资金）之前，我们有很多可以做的事情来更好地协调我们现有的资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think one of the few areas where Nadeem and I might actually agree on this is that even in areas where we've got these highly trained professionals, wait times are often long because we're not doing a very good job of coordinating the resources that we have. So, you know, when I see a patient in my practice who needs a hip or knee replacement, for example, I have very little way of knowing who could who could see that patient most quickly. And we don't have a coordinated system of getting people in with the next available provider in their region. And so we find actually that not only are wait times long in general, but they're highly variable by region. And, you know, even within each province and territory. And so there's a lot that we could be doing to better coordinate those services so that when it's determined that what a person needs, for example, is to see a neurologist, that they're given the next available appointment with the next available neurologist at a convenient location in their region who can deal with their issue. And there are lots of examples in some of the countries that Nadeem names, and even in Canada for some kinds of services. So for example, we we see in Ontario in our cancer care system, you know, I don't refer to doctor so and so radiation oncologist my patient, when they have a new diagnosis of cancer is seen in a regional cancer centre by the next available expert who can deal with that form of cancer. And so those those things are all centralised. The same is true for cardiac care. You know, people aren't waiting to see a specific individual. They're they're put into a single common queue and seen by the next available provider. And actually those are some of the systems where our outcomes are the best and our wait times are the shortest. So there's a lot that we can do even before we start talking about spending more money, whether it's public money or private money, to coordinate better the resources that we've got.</p>
</details>

Nadeem，我请您对此作出回应。另外，您认为还有什么因素阻碍了我们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nadeem, I'll get you to to respond to that. And also, what else is what else do you think is holding us back?</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 我认为 Martin 博士的观点非常正确。当然，当我们审视萨斯喀彻温省的经验时，他们将等待名单从全国最长缩短到全国最短，我们看到护理的协调在中央接收环节确实是整个过程的关键部分。但我们还必须记住，我们不仅比其他所有人都花得多，而且等待时间也比其他所有人都长，我们在发达国家中拥有的医生、医疗技术和医院病床数量也是最少的之一。这是一个加拿大特有的问题。这是一个医疗系统，充斥着缺乏可及性，存在一个需要解决的能力问题。这不是一个钱的问题。我认为问题在于，我们如何从已经支出的医疗费用中获得更多的价值，我们如何获得更好的服务可及性？我认为，如果我们审视那些做得更好的其他发达国家，我们就会看到一套不同的政策。我们看到私营企业家和私营部门在增强能力方面发挥着更大的作用。我们看到不同的金融结构，从而带来更好的整体医疗体验，总体而言，这对患者来说更经济实惠，也更公平。我注意到 Martin 博士谈到了加拿大医疗系统中的公平性。在医疗公平性衡量方面，我们处于中等偏下水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Dr. Martin makes a great point. And certainly when we look at the experience of Saskatchewan, where they reduced their waiting list from the longest in the country to the shortest in the country, we see that coordination of care in that central intake was actually a key piece of the process. But we also have to remember, not only are we spending more than everybody else, and not only are we waiting more than everybody else, we have some of the fewest physicians, medical technologies, and hospital beds in the developed world. This is a Canadian. This is a health care system that's fraught with lack of access, with a capacity issue that needs to be solved. And it's not a money problem. The question is, I think, how do we get more money, more value, rather, for the health care dollars we're already spending, how do we get better access to services? And I think if we look at those other developed nations that are doing a better job, we just see a different set of policies in place. We see a larger role for private entrepreneurs and the private sector to bolster capacity. We see different financial constructs to lead to a much better overall health care experience that in total is more affordable for patients and far more equitable. I note Dr. Martin talked about equity in the Canadian health care system. We're mid-pack to below average when it comes to measures of equity in health care.</p>
</details>

Nadeem，我们继续聊。您提到了那里的一些政策。有哪些？请给我们举一些国家和一些政策的例子，您现在看到它们的医疗系统时会希望我们也能拥有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nadeem, let's stick with you. You mentioned some policies there. What? Give us some examples of some nations and some policies right now that you're looking at their health care system being like wish we had that right now.</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 好的，让我们回到**C.D. Howe报告**，它主要基于**联邦基金会研究**（Commonwealth Fund: 美国一家专注于医疗政策研究的私人基金会）对拥有全民医疗保健系统的发达国家的调查。在可及性方面，最好的系统在普遍可及服务的提供中存在私营竞争。它们拥有私营竞争性保险。在这些国家，私营部门不是医疗系统的敌人。它是提供更好的全民可及医疗体验的宝贵伙伴。澳大利亚、德国、荷兰、瑞士等表现最佳的国家都是如此。加拿大在医疗系统中引入私营部门方面落后了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well let's come back to that C.D. Howe report, which was largely built on the Commonwealth Fund study looking at developed nations with universal health care systems. The very best systems when it comes to access, have private competition in the delivery of universally accessible services. They have private competitive insurance. The private sector is not an enemy of the health care system in these nations. It's a valuable partner in delivering better universal access health care experiences. That's true in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the top performing nations are all doing this. Canada is behind in involving the private sector in our health care system.</p>
</details>

Martin 博士，当 Nadeem 提到“私营”时，我看到您脸上露出了笑容。对一些人来说，当他们听到医疗保健与这个词联系在一起时，会有所反应。我想听听您对 Nadeem 所说的话的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Martin, when Nadeem says private, I see a smile on your face. For some people when they hear that word with health care, there is a reaction. I want to get your response on what Nadeem had to say there.</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 嗯，我的意思是，我认为，从我的角度来看，这是一个笑容，因为，你知道，我们这些从事医学教育的人现在正在加班加点地工作，以培训比加拿大历史上任何时候都多的医生，因为我认为我们的医生与人口比例确实需要提高。而且，全国各地正在开展培训更多护士等工作。但我们面临的一个困境，我认为人们理解这一点很重要，那就是鉴于我们确实存在医疗专业人员短缺，而且顺便说一句，这些短缺是全球性的，**世界卫生组织**（World Health Organisation: 联合国下属的国际卫生机构）和其他全球多边组织已宣布世界各地在各种领域都存在短缺。如果我们开放私营企业，我们通常会发现，我们正在将这些稀缺资源从公共系统拉到其他这些模式中。所以我认为我们必须小心这里的意外后果。你知道，私人外科诊所的工作可能对护士很有吸引力。然后那个护士就会离开公立医院去那里工作。然后发生的事情是，公立医院和公共系统的人员不足和等待时间实际上会变得更长。所以我们必须把整个事情看作一个生态系统。我们不能仅仅从另一个国家的医疗系统中抽取一个方面，然后说，你知道，他们在私营部门中扮演着更大的角色，因此，将私营部门引入加拿大背景会使事情变得更好。有很多理由担心，实际上，这会使事情变得更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, I think, you know, from my perspective, it's it's a smile because, you know, those of us in medical education are working overtime right now to train more doctors than we've ever trained before in Canada, because I think it's true that our physician to population ratio in Canada needs to be higher. And there's work underway to, you know, to train more nurses across the country, etc. But part of the dilemma that we face that I think it's important for people to understand is that given that we do have shortages of health care professionals, and those shortages, by the way, are global, the World Health Organisation and other global multilateral organisations have declared shortages all over the world in all kinds of areas. If if we open up for private entrepreneurship, what we often find is that we're we're pulling those scarce resources out of the public system and into these other, these other models. So I think we have to be careful about unintended consequences here. You know, it may be that a job in a private surgical clinic is attractive to a nurse. And and that that nurse then leaves the public hospital to go and work there. And what happens then is that the understaffing and the wait times in the public hospitals and the public system actually get longer. And so we have to we have to look at the whole thing as an ecosystem. We can't just pull one aspect of another country's health care system out and say, well, you know, they have a bigger role for the private sector, therefore, putting the private sector into the Canadian context would make things better. There's lots of reason to be concerned that actually, it would make things much worse.</p>
</details>

Nadeem，我请您快速回应一下，然后我们将转向安大略省的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nadeem, I'll get you in for a quick response and then we'll shift over to Ontario here.</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 当然，我们总体上存在人力短缺。相对于国际平均水平，我们不一定存在护士短缺。但我们还必须记住，加拿大有失业的外科医生找不到手术岗位。有外科医生愿意做更多手术，但无法进入公共手术室。有护士离开公共系统，因为她们不愿意接受工作条件，简单地离开了这个行业或去了美国工作，尽管我们拥有的专业人员，特别是医疗专业人员，相对于其他国家来说非常少，但我们在这个国家拥有可以利用的备用资源，我们可以比现在更好地利用它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Certainly we have an overall manpower shortage. We don't necessarily, relative to international averages, have a nurse shortage. But we also have to remember we have unemployed surgeons in Canada who can't find surgical placements. We have surgeons willing to do more surgical time who can't get access to the public operating room. We have nurses leaving the public system because they're unwilling to accept the working conditions, and simply leaving the profession or working in the United States, in spite of the fact that we have very few professionals, medical professionals, particularly relative to other countries, we have spare resources in this country that we can tap and make much better use of than we are now.</p>
</details>

### 安大略省的初级护理改革

好的。离家更近一点，**安大略省卫生部**（Ministry of Health in Ontario）表示，通过将**医疗连接**（Health Care Connect: 安大略省一项帮助居民寻找家庭医生或初级护理团队的服务）初级护理等待名单减少了50%，达到了一个重要的里程碑。Martin 博士，这看起来相当重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Closer to home, the Ministry of Health in Ontario says it's hit a major milestone by reducing the Health Care Connect waitlist for primary care by 50%. Dr. Martin, that seems pretty significant.</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 哈利路亚。我的意思是，看到安大略省初级护理的等待名单开始下降，我再高兴不过了。我要说，当我们宣布一项优先事项时，就会发生这样的事情。安大略省政府之所以宣布一项优先事项，部分原因是我们的政客们在挨家挨户拜访时听到了人们的声音，你知道，人们对他们说，我怎么可能找不到家庭医生？我为什么要四处奔波，乞求、恳求并问我的阿姨她的家庭医生是否会接诊我？等等等等。当我们都觉得获得初级护理应该是一项权利，并且应该像我的孩子可以上公立学校一样，轻松地在我的社区获得一个初级护理团队时。所以我们开始看到这份名单有所进展，部分原因是政府进行了投资。新的团队正在组建，你知道，新的医生正在接受培训。我们已经简化了国际培训专业人员进入初级护理的途径。但他们对医疗连接做的另一件事是清理了名单，因为，你知道，当名单不协调，人们长时间地等待时，结果发现有人搬走了，有人离开了，有人在此期间找到了家庭医生。你知道，各种各样的事情都表明人们在多个名单上，这实际上在整个加拿大医疗系统中都很常见，人们在三个不同的**核磁共振成像**（Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 一种医学影像技术）机器的等待名单上，然后他们就没有出现在另外两个预约中，因为他们已经在其他地方做过了。所以这种缺乏协调是导致我们等待名单长度的一个主要因素。而且，这是我们只需清理数据就可以缩短等待时间的事情。但在初级护理方面，我们也已经开始缩短等待时间，因为我们正在投入精力、能量和金钱来努力扭转这个系统。没有什么能让我更高兴了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hallelujah. I mean, I couldn't be happier to see the waitlist for primary care in Ontario beginning to come down. And I'll say that this is what happens when we declare a priority. And one of the reasons why the government of Ontario declared a priority is because our politicians were hearing it at the doors, you know, people saying to them, how is it possible that I can't get a family doctor? Why am I having to run around and beg and plead and ask my aunt if her family doctor will take me? Et cetera, et cetera. When we all feel that access to primary care should be a right, and it should be easy to to access a primary care team in my neighborhood, just like my kid can go to the public school. And so we are beginning to see movement on that list, in part because government has invested. New teams are being built, you know, new doctors are being trained. We've streamlined access for internationally trained professionals to come into primary care. But the other thing that they did with Health Care Connect Connect was they cleaned up the list because, as you know, when the list is uncoordinated and people have been sitting on it for a long time, it turns out people have moved, people have left, people have found a family doctor in the interim. You know, there's all kinds of things that that that people are on multiple lists, which we see actually all over the Canadian health care system, people on waiting lists for three different MRI machines, and then they fail to show up for the other two because they already got one someplace else. So this lack of coordination is a major factor in the length of our wait list. And it is something that we you can reduce the wait times just by cleaning up your data. But in the case of primary care, we have also begun to reduce the wait times because we are investing effort and energy and money in trying to turn the system around. And nothing could make me happier.</p>
</details>

现在，为了让我们的观众了解最新情况。该省承诺在2025年1月1日之前，将**医疗连接**等待名单上的23.5万人，在2026年春季之前连接到家庭医生或初级护理团队。所以 Nadeem，根据我的计算，我想我这里没问题。11.8万名安大略省居民已经连接到初级护理团队。这并非微不足道，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now just to catch our viewers up. The province committed to connecting 235,000 people that were on the Health Care Connect waitlist as of January 1st, 2025, to either a family doctor or primary care team by spring 2026. So Nadeem with that, my math, I think I'm all right here. 118,000 Ontarians connected with a primary care team. It's not insignificant, is it?</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 不，当然这对11.8万安大略省居民来说是非常积极的，对与他们有联系的人来说也无疑是积极的。这是一个积极的步骤，但这是一个非常政治化的声明。它只是1月1日名单上的人数的一半，而这个名单总共有25万多名安大略省居民，但医学院却说有超过200万人没有医生。我们知道，在2024年，有30万安大略省居民在需要护理时离开了急诊室，因为他们无法获得医疗服务。2023年和2024年，有1万人死在等待名单上。所以，在一个表现相当糟糕的系统中，这是一个非常小的进步，但对于11.8万安大略省居民来说，这无疑是一个积极的进步，对他们来说是一个积极的转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, and certainly very positive for 118,000 Ontarians, certainly positive for those connected to them. This is a positive step, but it's a very political statement. It's half of the people who are on the list at January 1st, which is all of 250 odd thousand Ontarians, where the college is saying there's over 2 million without a doctor. We know in 2024, 300,000 Ontarians left emergency rooms when they needed care because they couldn't get access to the health care services. 10,000 died on a waiting list in 2023, 2024. So it's a very small gain in a system that's doing quite poorly, but it is certainly a positive gain for 118,000 Ontarians, without question, a positive shift for them.</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 嗯，我实际上会说，我，我的意思是，仅仅因为人们在等待名单上死亡，并不意味着他们是因为在等待名单上而死亡。人们总是在各种各样的原因下死亡，同时他们也在做各种各样的事情，你知道，他们也在做很多其他的事情，同时他们也死亡了。但我会说，你知道，初级护理的可及性问题不仅仅是安大略省的问题。这是全国性的问题。我们都知道，当你没有家庭医生或初级护理团队时，医疗系统中的其他一切都无法运作。人们不应该因为高血压没有得到良好管理而中风去急诊室，因为他们没有家庭医生。人们不应该因为没有人跟踪并给他们接种流感疫苗和更新他们的文件等而因慢性肺病的可避免恶化而住院。所以。这需要成为全国每个省、地区和联邦政府的核心优先事项。人们需要能够期望在家附近获得初级护理，这不是我们能在任何地方一夜之间解决的问题。但是，当政府宣布一项优先事项，医疗专业人员支持它，加拿大人民说这对我们来说是一个优先事项时，我们就可以开始行动。我认为我们正在不列颠哥伦比亚省看到这种开始。我们正在安大略省、爱德华王子岛看到这种开始的开始。全国各地有很多优秀的模式范例正在发生。它不仅仅是医生，它将是**跨专业团队**（Interprofessional Teams: 由不同医疗专业人员组成的团队，共同为患者提供患者护理），因为未来的模式是医生与护士、**执业护士**（Nurse Practitioners: 拥有高级护理实践资质的注册护士）、**药剂师**（Pharmacists: 负责配药和提供药物咨询的专业人员）以及其他医疗工作者团队合作，以便能够用我们现有的资源为更多的人服务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, and I would say actually that I'm I mean, just because people die while on a waiting list doesn't mean that they die because they're on a waiting list. People die all the time for all kinds of reasons, at the same time that they're on all kinds of, you know, they're also doing lots of other things at the same time that they die. But I will say that, you know, this question of access to primary care is not just an issue in Ontario. It's an issue across the country. And we all know that when you don't have a family doctor or a primary care team, nothing else works in the health care system. People should not be having to go to the emergency department with a stroke because their hypertension, their high blood pressure was not well-managed because they didn't have a family doctor. People should not be getting admitted to the hospital with an avoidable exacerbation of chronic lung disease because nobody was keeping track and giving them their their flu immunization and renewing their papers, etc.. And so. This needs to be a core priority for every single provincial, territorial and the federal government across the country. People need to be able to expect to access primary care close to home, and that's not something that we're going to be able to fix anywhere overnight. But when a government declares a priority and the medical profession gets behind it, and the people of Canada say this is a priority for us, then we can start to move. And I think that is we are seeing the beginnings of that in British Columbia. We're seeing the beginning of beginnings of it in Ontario, in Prince Edward Island. There are lots of great examples of models happening across the country. It's not just going to be doctors, it will be interprofessional teams, because that's the model of the future is doctors working in teams with nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, other healthcare workers in order to be able to serve a larger number of people with the resources that we've got.</p>

### 解决方案与未来展望

Martin 博士，您提到了解决方案。所以我想在我们仅剩的几分钟里，确保我们触及一些解决方案。Nadeem，当我们审视那些同类国家，无论是荷兰、德国、英国还是澳大利亚，我们可以采纳哪些最佳实践？请给我两个解决方案。

<p class="english-text">Dr. Martin, you had mentioned fixes. So I want in our last little minute that we have make sure that we touch on some solutions. Nadeem, what kind of best practices can we adopt when we look at those peer countries, whether it's Netherlands, Germany, the UK or Australia? What? Give me two solutions.</p>
</details>

**Nadeem:** 我认为答案归结为获得更高的资金价值。再次强调，如果我们审视所有表现最佳的国家，无论是那些拥有最佳等待时间、体验还是医疗过程最佳结果的国家，它们都比加拿大做得更好，我们看到医疗系统中涉及了私营竞争、创业精神和创新。私营部门不是全民医疗保健的敌人。私营部门实际上是建立一个高效能全民可及医疗系统的伙伴，一个我们已经为此付费的系统。我们当然不需要在医疗保健上花费更多资金。我们已经是顶级支出国。我们只需要从我们已经支出的资金中获得实际价值。

<p class="english-text">I think the answer comes back to getting better value for money. And again, if we look at 100% of the top performing nations, whether it's those nations with the best wait times, experiences or the best outcomes from the healthcare process, performing better than Canada is, we see private competition, entrepreneurship and innovation involved in the healthcare system. The private sector is not an enemy of universal healthcare. The private sector is in fact a partner in getting a high performing universal access healthcare system, a system we're already paying for. And we certainly don't need to spend more money on healthcare. We're already a top spender. We just need to get the actual value for the dollars we're already spending.</p>

Martin 博士，请您说最后一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Martin, get the last word.</p>
</details>

**Dr. Martin:** 嗯，我们都同意我们需要更高的资金价值。我想说的是，作为一名在医疗系统工作的人，我不想看到更多的竞争。我希望看到更多的协作。我希望看到医院共同努力，确保当我的病人需要什么时，他们能在我所在地区获得下一个可用的预约。我希望看到团队不仅仅由医生组成，而是由其他医疗工作者共同努力，为我们服务的社区和人口承担责任。实际上，正是这种协作定义了许多其他表现优于我们的国家的交付模式。我认为这是我们在加拿大需要更多看到的东西。

<p class="english-text">Well, we're we're in agreement that we need better value for money. And what I would say is, as a person working in the healthcare system, I don't want to see more competition. I want to see more collaboration. I want to see hospitals working together to make sure that when my patient needs something, they get the next available appointment in my region. And I want to see teams not just of physicians, but of other healthcare workers working together to take responsibility for the neighborhoods and the populations that we serve. It's that kind of collaboration, actually, that defines the delivery models in many of the other countries that are outperforming us. And I think that's what we need to see more of in Canada.</p>
