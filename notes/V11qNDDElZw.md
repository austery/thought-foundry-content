### 全球新秩序与加拿大定位

**主持人**: 您是否觉得各国现在正排队与我们达成协议？美国资产存在一种以前没有的风险溢价。问题是，这种风险溢价会卖到多高？会卖到哪里？这部分将取决于新体系的连贯性如何。美国是否可靠地致力于建立一个新体系或一系列协议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is that the sense you get that nations are lining up to cut a deal with us right now? There's a risk premium in US assets that wasn't there before. And the question is, how big is that risk premium going to sell? And where is it going to sell? And that, in part, is going to depend on how coherent the new system is. And is there, does the US credibly commit to a new system or a series of deals?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 我确实相信有一系列志同道合的国家。我们非常希望美国能成为这个群体的一部分，但这些志同道合的国家将因此发展更深入的贸易和安全关系。这是一个次优选择的世界。这不是我们都想要的，但这是合乎逻辑的做法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: I do believe that there are a series of like-minded countries. We very much like the US to be part of that group, but like-minded countries who will develop deeper trading and security relationships as a consequence of this. It's the world of second best. It's not what we would all want, but it's the logical thing to do.

</details>

**主持人**: 总理，这个播客是在哪里找到您的？我现在在蒙特利尔。教授，世界上大多数人花10分钟看国内新闻，20分钟看国际新闻。在美国，我们有点自恋，不怎么谈论其他国家。我想大多数人都听说过您，在电视上见过您，但对您了解不多。您能讲讲您的背景，您的起源故事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The Prime Minister, where does this podcast find you? I'm in Montreal right now. Professor, the majority of the world spends their news is 10 minutes domestic and 20 minutes international. In the US, we're kind of self-absorbed, narcissistic. We don't talk a lot about other countries. I think most people have heard of you, have seen you on TV, but don't know much about you. Can you give us a sort of your backstory, your origin story?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，当然。我出生在加拿大北部的**北极地区**，一个叫**史密斯堡**的地方，在**西北地区**。我在**埃德蒙顿**长大，那些可能关注冰球的人会记得那是**韦恩·格雷茨基**为**油人队**效力的日子，那是我小时候。我去了美国上大学，然后我在**华尔街**工作，或者说在**高盛**的伦敦、东京、纽约分部工作，最终回到了加拿大。大约20年前，我成为了**加拿大银行**的副行长，这相当于美国的**联邦储备银行**。在2008年金融危机期间，我最终成为了行长。所以，我经历了金融危机。如果加拿大能有一场“好的”金融危机，那我们就是了。我们比其他任何人都更好地度过了危机，变得更强大，银行也保持了稳定。然后，有点奇怪的是，我被邀请担任**英格兰银行**行长。所以我成为了**英格兰银行**的第一位外国行长，我是在**英国脱欧**公投期间以及之后担任这个职务的，然后于2020年，在新冠疫情最严重的时候回到了加拿大。我想，如果我听您的播客，快速阅读的话，您在疫情期间的经历可能比我好。之后，我为**联合国**做了很多关于气候变化的工作，算是无偿的，组织金融部门帮助应对气候变化。但同时，我也为大型资产管理公司**Brookfield**工作，我是**彭博**的董事。然后，从一月份开始，我首先竞选了**自由党**的领导人，这是这里的主要政党之一。赢得选举后，大约一个月前我成为了总理，现在我正在竞选。最后一点，我们的选举比美国短得多。我们的竞选活动是37天，我们还剩下大约两周的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Yeah, sure. So I was born in the Arctic, the north of Canada, a place called Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. I grew up in Edmonton, and those who might follow hockey, it was the days of Wayne Gretzky when he was playing for the Oilers. That was when I was a kid. I went away to university in the US, and then I worked on Wall Street, or versions of Wall Street, or worked for Goldman Sachs in London and Tokyo and New York, and ultimately, Canada. And then I went in about 20 years ago to become the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, which is the equivalent of the Federal Reserve in the US. I ended up being the Governor during the financial crisis of 2008. So I worked with, you know, through that process of the financial crisis. We had a good financial crisis, if you can have a good financial crisis in Canada. We got through it better than anyone else, emerged stronger, our bank stayed together. And then ultimately, I kind of slightly bizarrely, I was asked to become Governor of the Bank of England. So I became the first foreigner Governor of the Bank of England, and I did that through the period of the Brexit referendum, as it turned out, and in the aftermath of that. And then came back Canada, 2020, right in the middle of COVID. You had, I think you probably had a better experience during COVID, if I listening to your podcast, if I read it quickly than I did. And then I worked, I did a lot of work on climate change for the United Nations, sort of pro bono, and organizing the financial sector to help address climate change. But also at the same time, I worked for Brookfield, which is a big asset manager. And I was on the board of Bloomberg. And then, as of the start of January, I first ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party, which is one of the main parties here. And winning that became Prime Minister about a month ago, and now I'm running for election. We have, last point, much shorter elections in the United States. Our campaign is 37 days, and we've got two weeks roughly left to go.

**主持人**: 播客的一位重要朋友是地缘政治战略家**伊恩·布雷默**。他上周在播客中，形容您是“加拿大在全球舞台上的划时代人物”。在您看来，加拿大在全球舞台上扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, a big friend of the pod is Ian Bremmer, the geopolitical strategist. And he was on the pod last week, and he described you as an open quote, generational mind for Canada on the global stage, close quote. In your view, what role does Canada play on the global stage?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 我们扮演着几个角色。我们是**G7**成员国。事实上，我们今年是**G7**的主席国，所以我担任**G7**主席。我们是**英联邦**成员国，那是旧的英国集团。我们是**法语国家组织**成员国，这显然是大约60个法语国家的集团。所以，我们在几个不同的组织中扮演着角色。我认为我们在新的或正在出现的全球秩序中可能扮演的角色，部分基于我们的资产。我们是各种形式的能源和新兴能源超级大国。我们是世界上最大的**关键矿产**供应商之一。我们在**人工智能**方面相当出色，很多人都这么说，但我们认为这是名副其实的。因此，我们可以作为一个相信开放市场、开放体系、相信贸易、开放思想、多元化的国家，与志同道合的国家一起，重建国际秩序中被颠覆的部分。这在过去几个月里变得更加激烈，但这个过程实际上始于15年前的金融危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: So, we play, I mean, we play several roles. We're a member of the G7. In fact, we are chair of the G7 this year, so I'm chair of the G7. We're a member of the Commonwealth, which is the old UK grouping. We're member of the Francophonie, which is the obviously the Francophone grouping of about 60 countries. So, we have our role in several different, let's call it organizations, self-appointed organizations or groupings. I think one of the roles we play potentially in the new or the emerging global order is partly based on our assets. We are an energy and emerging energy superpower in all forms of energy. We're one of the largest critical mineral suppliers in the world. We're pretty good in AI. A lot of people claim that, but we're I think legitimately claiming that. And so we can play a role as a country that believes in open markets, open systems, believes in trade, open ideas, diversity. We can play a role with like-minded countries to kind of reconstruct that bit of that bit of the international order, which has been, I'm in Montreal, they would say "boulversé", it's been upended in the course of more intensively in the last few months, but a process that really began with the financial crisis 15 years ago.

### 加拿大面临的挑战与政策议程

**主持人**: 好的，对于我们的听众来说，房间里的大象是关税，我稍后会谈到。但我想先从这里开始：通常在美国，我想加拿大也一样，新领导人当选后（假设您当选），他们会有一段蜜月期，有机会在第一年完成更多事情，获得更多的宽容，如果可以这么说的话，而不是在接下来的两三年里。您认为加拿大面临的两个或三个最大问题是什么？如果让您选择两三件您在担任总理的第一年要全力以赴的事情，您的议程会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And just for our listeners, the elephant in the room is tariffs, I'm going to get to that. But I want to start with if you were to. So typically in the US, I imagine the same way in Canada, when a new leader is elected, assuming you get elected, they have sort of a honeymoon period and an opportunity to get more done in their first year, more grace, if you will, than in the next two or three years. What would you identify as the two or three biggest issues facing Canada? And what's your agenda, if you could pick two or three things, you're really going to go hard at your first year as Prime Minister, what are those things?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，正如您刚才所说，我将把关税放在一边，重点关注三件事。首先是在加拿大境内实现**自由贸易**。我们这里基本上有13个经济体，10个不同的省和地区，都有自己的规则。在全国范围内转移资质，有时是商品和服务，比应有的困难得多。所以，我们需要一个非常快速的自由贸易进程。顺便说一句，就其量级而言，一个合理的估计是，其经济效益甚至超过了**特朗普**关税最糟糕版本带来的经济打击，所以我们能给自己带来的好处比别人能给我们的更多。第二件事是，我们这里有一个巨大的**住房问题**，特别是对于年轻的加拿大人。首先，我们需要将住房建设速度提高一倍，我们需要进行一些重大改革才能做到这一点，我不会深入所有细节，但我很乐意。我们可以以一种有效利用加拿大供应链技术和所有木材的方式来做，这些木材我们可能无法向南运往美国。然后第三件事，世界是流动的，恐怕这有点涉及到关税，但我认为贸易体系将很快被重新排序。因此，在第一年里，问题是，除了美国之外，我们还将深化与谁的关系？这些关系，最后一点，既关乎经济也关乎安全，世界变得更加危险，安全问题是首要考虑。那么，在欧洲或整个**欧盟**、英国，在亚洲，我们将与谁建立伙伴关系？如果我能再说最后一件事，斯科特，那就是加拿大人被美国发生的事情深深震撼了，他们对所有这些优先事项都非常开放，人们愿意做大事，他们正在团结起来，愿意做大事，因为他们知道他们必须做大事，因为世界变化太大了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Yeah. As you just suggested, I'll set tariffs aside and focus in on three things. First is having free trade, actually, within Canada. We have, you know, basically 13 economies here, 10 different provinces and territories, all with their own rules. It's hard to move credentials, and sometimes goods and services across the country, far harder than it should be. So a process, a very quick process of free trade. And by the way, just to put orders of magnitude on this, you know, a reasonable estimate of the economic benefit of that is bigger than the economic hit from the worst version of the Trump tariffs, so we can kind of give ourselves more than others can. Second thing is we have a huge housing problem here, and particularly, obviously, for younger Canadians. First and foremost, we need to double the rate of housing, and we need to, I won't go into all the details, I'm happy to, but we need some major reforms in order to do that. We can do it in a way that actually leverages, you know, the Canadian supply chain technology and all the lumber, we potentially won't be able to send southbound to the US. And then the third thing, look, the world's fluid, I'm afraid this kind of comes towards tariffs, but I think the trading system is going to get reordered fairly quickly. And so in the course of the first year, the question is, well, who are we going to deepen our relationships with other than United States? And those relationships, last point, are both economic and security. The world's a much more dangerous place. Security concerns are top of the list. So who in Europe, or European Union as a whole, UK, who in Asia, where are we going to partnership? If I can say one last thing, Scott, is you know, just being shaken so hard by what's happening in the United States, Canadians are very open to all of those priorities. Like people are up for big things, they're coming together, and they're willing to do big things because they know they have to do big things because the world's changed so much.

### 加美贸易关系与关税问题

**主持人**: 好的，让我们以此为切入点谈谈关税。我过去两分钟没看我的**Apple Watch**，所以不知道现在情况如何。据我所知，加拿大是我们的最大贸易伙伴。我们现在倾向于痴迷于中国，但您是我们的最大贸易伙伴。不，您是我们最重要的。是的。那么请您告诉我们现在的情况。您是代表我们最大经济贸易伙伴的人，请根据您所知，描述一下美国和加拿大之间正在发生的事情。目前情况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, let's use that as a segue into tariffs. So I haven't checked my Apple Watch in the last two minutes, so I don't know the state of things right now. My understanding Canada's are our largest trading partner. Now we tend to be obsessed with China, but you're our largest trading partner. No, you're our most important. Yeah. So give us the state of play. You're the man representing our largest trading partner, economically, as to the best of your knowledge, describe the state of play between what is happening between the US and Canada. Where does it sit at this moment?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我将从坏消息开始，或者我们称之为不合理的措施，也就是现在实施的关税。我们今天仍然实施着最初因**芬太尼**从加拿大越境而来而合理化的关税。对于那些没有关注此事的听众来说，进入美国的芬太尼中，来自加拿大的不到1%。事实上，你们的听众很专业，所以我可以说，只有19个基点（0.19%）的芬太尼从加拿大越境而来。我们已经采取了重大措施来加强边境，包括无人机、直升机等，在过去三个月里，这一数字又下降了90%。但这些关税打击了加拿大广泛的商品，涉及数千亿美元的商品。这些是美国征收的25%关税。其次，我们还受到钢铁和铝关税的影响，这些是所谓的232条款国家安全关税。我们是美国最大的铝供应商。我们是美国最重要的钢铁供应商之一，这些关税可能影响美国数十万依赖加拿大钢铁和铝的工作岗位。第三，我们还受到汽车关税的影响，可能大家都知道，但我个人化地解释一下。有一个叫做**汽车协议**的东西，在我出生的那一年，也就是60年前签署的。60年来，我们与美国建立了日益一体化的汽车系统。40年前的**加美自由贸易协定**使其更加紧密，然后是**北美自由贸易协定**及其后续协议。所以，这些公司和供应链，主要的零部件供应商，实际上是完全一体化的。现在，在这种情况下，美国却要征收25%的关税，这对于一个利润率只有5%到7%的行业来说，是绝对具有破坏性的。所以，我们有三套关税。我们尚未受到所谓的对等关税。因此，可以说，两国关系紧张，因为所有这些关税都违反了你们称之为**USMCA**，我们称之为**CUSMA**的贸易协定。好消息是，大约三周前，**特朗普总统**和我进行了交谈。我们同意在加拿大大选之后，将开始就一项全面、新的经济安全关系进行谈判。所以，我们可以说，我们正在排队等待这些讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: So I'll start with the bad news, or as we would call it, the unjustified news, which is what tariffs are in place. We have still in place today, tariffs that were originally justified because of fentanyl coming across the border from Canada. Just for the listeners who haven't tracked this, less than 1% of the fentanyl imported into United States comes from Canada. In fact, you've got a sophisticated audience, so I can say things like 19 basis points of the fentanyl comes across the border from Canada. We've taken major steps to reinforce the border, drones, helicopters, other things, and it's fallen by a further 90% over the course of the last three months. But those tariffs hit a wide range of goods in Canada, hit a wide range of goods. And there's a few carve-outs for that, but it's hitting hundreds of billions of goods. And those are 25% tariffs from the United States. Then we are also caught, secondly, we're also caught in the steel and aluminum tariffs, which are these national security tariffs, so-called 232 tariffs. We are the largest supplier of aluminum in the United States. We're one of the most important suppliers of steel to the United States, and you can roll those up into hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US, depending on Canadian steel and aluminum. And then the third thing is, we are caught in the auto tariffs, as people probably know. But I'll just personalize it. There was something called the Auto Pact, which was signed the year I was born, 60 years ago. And we have had an increasingly integrated auto system with the United States for 60 years. It got tighter with the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement 40 years ago, and then with NAFTA and the successor. So literally, these companies and the supply chains, the main parts suppliers, they're virtually fully integrated. And now into the middle of this is coming 25% US tariffs, which are, you know, in an industry, as you know, that has, you know, 5, 7% margins. I mean, this is this is absolutely damaging. So we have three sets of tariffs. We are not subject yet to the so-called reciprocal tariffs to the US. So the state of the relationship is strained to say the least, because all of these tariffs are in violation of what you call USMCA, we call CUSMA, the same trade agreement. The good news, or the better news is that three weeks ago or so, President Trump and I spoke. And we agreed that following the Canadian election, there would be the beginning of a negotiation of a comprehensive, a new comprehensive relationship, economic security. So we are, we are in the queue, so to speak, for those discussions.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些行动似乎即将激发他们所设想的，即大量的交易，但这些交易是围绕着我们进行的。这似乎是合乎逻辑的。这是一个论点，我想请您验证或否定它。但如果我是一个**G7**国家，我有一个我曾经可以依赖的贸易伙伴，它曾经是互惠互利的，现在我不仅不能依赖他们，而且不知道明天会和谁打交道。这会是建立与其他国家对话的巨大动力吗？加拿大现在是否正在积极尝试绕开美国？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It strikes me that these actions are about to inspire what they envision, that is a tremendous amount of deal making, but deal making around us. That is, it just seems logical. This is a thesis, and I want you to validate or nullify it. But if I'm a G7 nation and I have a trading partner that I used to be able to count on that was mutually very prosperous. And now, I just not only can't count on them, but have no idea who I'm waking up next to. That it's incredible motivation to start establishing dialogue with other nations. Is respond to that thesis. Is Canada aggressively and actively trying to reroute around America right now?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我想说，贸易是一个“与”的世界。所以，你知道，这是一个正和游戏。正如您所知，如果做得对，双方都会赢。这不是一个零和游戏。所以我可能不会选择“绕开美国”这个说法。但显然，如果我们的产能过剩，或者我们有要开发的东西，我以**关键矿产**为例，我们是其中的重要参与者，我们将与谁进行贸易？我们可以依靠谁？我们在这里，我们向美国供应70%的**钾肥**。**钾肥**是化肥最重要的成分之一，70%。现在，对**钾肥**征收25%的关税。所以，当您思考这个问题时，也许我应该考虑另一种商品，尽管关键金属和矿产不仅仅是商品。如果我们要开发这些，也许我们希望与不会征收这种关税的供应链一起开发。所以，这验证了您的论点。我们，是的，我们已经开始加强与其他国家、其他贸易集团的讨论。我们已经有了一套相当不错的贸易协议。我们与**欧洲**有自由贸易协议。我们是**跨太平洋伙伴关系协定**的一部分。所以，我们有很多这样的协议，但我们正在寻求加强它们。而且，我们抱有希望，也许“希望”不是正确的词，但我们对重启美加贸易关系持开放态度，前提是对方有此意愿，并且我们可以达成那些正和协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Yeah. Well, I would say, you know, trade is a world of "and." So, you know, it's a positive sum game. As you know, both, you do it right, both sides win. It's not a zero sum game. So I might not choose the phrase "around America." But obviously, you, look, if we're, if we've got excess capacity, or we have things we're going to develop, I'll use the example of critical minerals, where we're a big player, who, with whom are we going to trade? Who can we rely on? You know, we're sitting here, we supply 70% of the potash to the United States. You know, one of the most important components of fertilizer, 70%. And there is a 25% tariff being put on potash. So when you think about it, well, geez, maybe I might want to take another, I'll call it a commodity, even though critical metals and minerals are more than that. If we're going to develop those, maybe we want to develop them with a supply chain to someone who's not going to slap a tariff like that on. So that validating your thesis. We, we, yeah, we have begun to intensify discussions with other, other countries, other trading blocks. We have a pretty good set of trading trade deals in place. We have free trade deal with Europe. We have free trade. We're part of the what was called the Trans-Pacific Part in Asia. So we have a number of those, but we're we're looking to reinforce them. And look, we're, we are hopeful, maybe hopeful isn't the right word, but we're open to, open is a better way to put it, to a restart of the US trading relationship provided there's willingness on the other side, and we can come to one of those positive sum deals.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想您会与许多其他**G7**或**G20**领导人交谈。现在大家对美国领导力的普遍共识是什么？我意识到您会更克制，更委婉或更外交。但这些世界领导人对正在发生的事情有什么看法？他们如何解释？或者你们如何互相解释？因为坦率地说，在美国，我们很多人都觉得这毫无意义，而这是我们的领导层。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So I would imagine you speak to a lot of other G7 or G20 leaders. What's the general consensus around American leadership right now? And I realize that you have more restraint and are a bit more or diplomatic. But what is the thesis among this group of world leaders around what is going on here? How do they explain it? How do you explain it to each other? Or can you explain it to each other? Because quite frankly, here in the US, a lot of this doesn't even make sense to us, and this is our leadership.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我认为首先要认识到，正如我所说，以及其他一些领导人，包括**G7**领导人所说，我们所知的体系已经结束了。当体系的支柱采取了一系列美国所做的措施，并且提出了一系列目标（我稍后会回到这一点），但这些目标与该体系几十年来（基本上自**柏林墙**倒塌以来，并在此后加剧）的运作方式不一致。所以，您认识到，这个以美国为中心的体系已经结束了。这就会引出您如何应对它？一部分是与美国的谈判，这是您一直关注的。但还有一部分是我们如何相互打交道，这也涉及到了美国试图实现的目标。我认为，这就像**彼得·蒂尔**十年前说的那样，认真对待**唐纳德·特朗普**的话。他们正在寻求在可能的情况下平衡贸易，这不是我们思考问题的方式，但却是美国思考问题的方式。而且，你知道，您确实会遇到像加拿大这样的奇怪情况。我们在商品贸易上，美国对加拿大有贸易顺差。造成对加拿大整体逆差的唯一原因是石油进口。好吧，如果您不想要我们的石油进口，那在一段时间内会有点问题，因为加拿大炼油厂的唯一其他选择是**委内瑞拉**。而且，他们也禁止了那些进口。所以，逻辑并不完全一致。我们姑且这么说。但我认为核心是认识到这种对更平衡贸易的渴望。因此，从美国政府的角度来看，我们心中的问题是，有些行业，特别是汽车业，航空航天业也会有另一个因素，然后还有一些大宗商品。有几个行业是如此一体化，以至于很难看出为什么为了美国的竞争力，更不用说北美的竞争力，将其拆散是有意义的。这将是我们的论点。然后还有其他行业，例如林产品、钢铁、铝这三个大例子，还有农业、**钾肥**（我举过这个例子）、**镍**等等，我们是如此巨大的供应商，而且是如此安全可靠的供应商。同样，对我们来说，这些被取代或征收关税是没有意义的。所以，我们看到，随着一些瓶颈变得更加明显，贸易政策正在演变。而且，我怀疑，我怀疑我们会看到更多。也许我再说一件事，那就是，美国政策的不一致之处，在我看来，是希望尽可能征收一些最低关税，这具有增加收入的因素。而且我认为，这与美国税收政策挂钩，这也是一种可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Well, I think the first thing is to recognize, as I have said, and a number of those other leaders have said, including G7 leaders, is that the system as we knew it is over. Right? When the anchor of the system has done a series of measures that the US has done, but also set out a series of objectives, and I'll come back to that, but set out a series of objectives that are just inconsistent with the way the system has been operating for decades, right? Basically, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, intensified since then. So, you recognize that that system anchored on the US is over. That then leads to how do you react to it? There's partly the negotiation with the US, and which you've been focused on. But then it's also how do we deal with each other, which we've also touched on in terms of what the US is trying to accomplish. I think it's, you know, I take, go back to Peter Thiel of 10 years ago, saying, "Take Donald Trump literally and seriously," but taking literally and seriously, and, you know, they're looking to balance, where to extent possible, to balance trade, which is not the way we think about things, but is the way the US thinks about things. And, you know, you do get into odd situations like Canada, where we actually run a, America has a trade surplus with Canada in goods. The only reason there's an overall deficit with Canada is because of basically oil imports. Well, if you don't want our oil imports, that will be a bit of a problem for a period of time because, you know, the only other option for the refineries that take Canadian oil is Venezuela. And that's, you know, they're just banned those, those imports as well. So there, it's not the logic isn't entirely consistent. Let's put it that way. But I think at the core, recognizing this desire for more balanced trade. And so from the US administration, the question, I think, in our mind, is there are some industries, autos, particularly, aerospace would have another element of this, and then a number of commodities. And there are a couple industries that are so integrated that it's hard to see why for US competitiveness, let alone North American competitiveness, it makes sense to pull them apart. That would be our argument. And then there's other industries, forest products, steel, aluminum as three big examples, where we're agriculture, potash, I gave that example, nickel, I could go on, where we're such huge suppliers and such a safe, secure supplier. Again, it doesn't really, to us, make sense that that would be displaced or tariffed. So, you know, we've seen that this, the trade policy is evolving as some of these choke points become more evident. And, you know, I suspect, I suspect, we will see more. Maybe I'll say one other thing if I could, which is, it strikes me a bit, what in the consistencies of US policy is a desire to have some minimum tariff, if possible, which has a revenue raising element to it. And I think, you know, tied into US tax policy, that is that is also a possibility here.

**主持人**: 据我所知，我们大约99%的贸易是免关税的，那1%是关于乳制品之类的。我们今天在加拿大和美国之间基本上不是一个自由贸易区吗？

<details>

**主持人**: My understanding is about 99% of our trade is tariff-free, and that 1% is around things like dairy. Haven't we largely been kind of a trade-free zone between Canada and the US today?

**马克·卡尼**: 是的，我们是。然后，就像任何贸易伙伴一样，您会遇到一些贸易摩擦和贸易争端，但我们有处理这些问题的程序。所以，我们有一些关于林产品、有时是钢铁和铝的持续问题，这些都得到了处理。但是的，贸易基本上是免关税的，当它是您最大的贸易伙伴时，将其拆散代价是相当大的，对双方都代价高昂。你知道，从加拿大的角度来看，我正在竞选公职，我与许多加拿大人交流。有一种非常强烈的感觉，是的，这将使我们付出代价。但我们愿意承担这个代价，以不同的方向重组我们的经济。这是一种非常强烈的感觉，我指的是“背叛”这个词。所以，我们签署了一项协议。我们有这种伙伴关系。我们真诚地遵守它。我们建立了企业。我们认识很多美国人，喜欢美国人，听美国播客。你知道，有这样一种亲近感，突然之间，我们受到了这些攻击，这就是这些措施被看待的方式，好吧，这将使我们在一段时间内付出代价，我们将与其他人一起建设。

**马克·卡尼**: Yeah, yeah, we have. And then we have, you know, like any trading partners, you get the odd trade irritant and, you know, trade dispute, but we have processes to deal with those. And so we had a, you know, we have ongoing things around forest products, sometimes steel and aluminum, and that's handled. But yeah, trade is basically tariff-free. And you, when it's your biggest trading partner, pulling that apart is is quite costly, is costly for both. You know, from a Canadian perspective, and, you know, I'm out on the road, I'm running for office, I'm talking to lots of Canadians up and down. There is a very strong sense of, yeah, this is going to cost us. But we're willing to take the price to restructure our economy in a different direction. Like, it's been such a sense of, I mean, the word that's used is "betrayal." So, you know, we signed a deal. We've had this partnership. We observe it in good faith. We set up businesses. You know, we know lots of Americans, would like Americans, but listen to American podcasts. You know, there's such a sense of, and all of a sudden, you know, we get these, you know, these attacks, which is the way these, this is viewed, is, okay, so it's going to cost us for a period of time, and we'll build out and build with others.

### 关税与英国脱欧的相似之处

**主持人**: 您是第一位非英国籍的**英格兰银行**行长。您有点像全球经济领导力的**博·杰克逊**。我曾将这些关税比作**英国脱欧**以来最大的乌龙球。这可能是一个粗糙的比喻，但我想请您补充一些细节。您看到了哪些相似之处？这如何影响您如何应对以及您认为最终结果会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You were the first non-Brit to serve to run the Bank of England. You're sort of the Bo Jackson of global economic leadership. I've compared this, and it might be a crude analogy, but I want you to, I want you to add some color, fill in the blanks here. I've described these tariffs as the biggest own goal since Brexit. What similarities do you see? And how does that inform A, how you respond to this and B, what you think ultimately, the outcome is?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我认为有很多相似之处，这始于经济学，正在发生的经济学。实际上，请简要描述一下**英国脱欧**。只需告诉我们**英国脱欧**的头条新闻。好的，**英国脱欧**的头条新闻是，由于各种原因，其中许多与经济无关，尽管它被宣传为经济上的胜利，但很多人知道，由于身份认同等原因，在2016年（如果我没记错日期的话）投票决定英国脱离**欧盟**。英国与**欧盟**在贸易和经济关系上的联系比加拿大与美国更为紧密，包括劳工的自由流动、资本的便捷流动、双向巨额贸易。如果您的产品符合英国的产品标准，您就不必担心，可以在欧洲任何国家销售。因此，正如我所说，由于各种原因，以微弱优势做出了脱离**欧盟**的决定。我记得当时我们认为，请记住，那是在利率处于谷底的时期，通胀过低，人们担心通缩等等。我们的看法是，经济将会放缓，失业率将会上升，通胀将会上升。而我们**英格兰银行**将不得不在此发生时提高利率。顺便说一句，货币也会贬值。货币贬值了20%到25%。相对于以前的水平，它仍然处于低位，因为它受到了巨大的负面贸易冲击，基本上是未来财富的巨大损失，货币市场首先对其进行了定价。我们预期的结果完全发生了。我的意思是，它大约在新冠疫情结束的同时发生，但又是一个巨大的负面供给冲击，因为您撕裂了贸易关系，生产能力相对于需求下降了。所以这导致了通货膨胀。两者的结合意味着英国的利率更高，并且比其他经济体有更大的通胀问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Well, I think there's, there are a lot of similarities, and it starts with the economics, the economics of what's happening. Actually, briefly describe Brexit. Because just give us the headline news on Brexit. So, the headline on Brexit is for a variety of reasons, and many of them not to do with economics, although it was sold as an economic win, but a lot of people know because of reasons of identity and others, voted in 2018, if I'll get my dates right, 2016, I guess, for the UK to leave the European Union. And the UK was even more tightly bound in trade and economic relationships with the European Union than Canada is with the United States, including free movement of labor, easy movement of capital, huge trade going both ways. You never had to get your product, if your product met the product standard in the UK, didn't have to worry about, you could sell any country in Europe. And so the decision taken, as I say, for a variety of reasons, narrowly, but taken to leave the European Union. I remember when it happened in our view at the time, and remember, this was during a period where it was interest rates were at rock bottom. Inflation was too low. People were worried about deflation, blah, blah. Our view was, okay, what's going to happen is the economy is going to slow, unemployment's going to go up, inflation is going to go up. And we at the Bank of England are going to have to raise interest rates when this happens. And by the way, the currency will also go down. The currency went down by 20, 25%. It's still on the floor relative to where it was, still on the floor because you had a big negative trade shock, a big loss of wealth, basically future wealth in the currency market, priced it first. And exactly what we expected to happen, happened. I mean, it happened to happen roughly at the same time as COVID was finishing, but yet a big, yeah, again, I'm relying on your audience, a big negative supply shock to the economy because you ripped up trading relationships, and the productive capacity went down relative to where demand was. So that was inflationary. And combination of that meant UK rates are higher, and it's got a bigger inflation problem. It has had another economies.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 当您看看美国发生的事情时，其贸易关系中产生的摩擦将导致同样的事情。它将减缓经济增长率。它将影响美元。正如我们所见，它已经对美元产生了负面影响。它将边际性地推高物价。所以，经济放缓、通胀更高、利率更高，所有条件都相同。现在，我所做的事情有一个很大的警告，或者说一个更好的限定词是，英国是一个更加开放的经济体，对欧洲的依赖程度更高，而美国是一个更加封闭的经济体。它依赖世界，但其量级不同。所以，方向相同，量级不同。因此，我认为这里有很多相似之处。我想也许另一个相似之处，如果我能再补充一个的话，那就是，这还有待观察，但我会说，英国，您会收到一些英国听众的仇恨邮件，但我会说，根据民意调查，人们普遍认为**英国脱欧**对英国经济产生了负面影响。可以说，现在三分之二的人都明白这一点。但回到更接近欧洲的道路在政治上非常困难。很难重建这种共识。他们行动非常缓慢。而您想想现在英国面临的世界局势，从贸易角度，甚至从安全角度来看，更接近欧洲有很多逻辑。他们建立了所谓的**乌克兰**“志愿联盟”，因为英国和美国正在减少对**乌克兰**的支持。顺便说一句，加拿大已经加强了支持，并与**澳大利亚**一起成为这个主要由欧洲组成的志愿联盟的一部分。所以，回到那种关系是有逻辑的，但一旦您打破了这些关系，就很难再回去了。因此，在我看来，接下来的六到十二个月对美国和全球贸易体系都将非常重要。因为问题是，好吧，我们明白旧体系发生了巨大的变化或破裂。但这种破裂会有多大？是否会有一个相对开放的贸易体系，对于，我在这里用引号表示，对于志同道合的国家，广义上的志同道合的国家？你知道，我认为**G7**国家是相当志同道合的。毫不奇怪，我们普遍重视自由、言论自由、开放市场。那么，我们是否会在我们自己之间建立一个相对开放的体系？还是只与少数国家？还是不与任何国家？我的意思是，这就是我们现在要争取的，但这个体系不会回到以前的样子。

**马克·卡尼**: When you look at what's happened in the US, the friction put into its trading relationships is going to cause the same thing. It is going to slow the rate of growth of that economy. It is going to affect the dollar. It has affected the dollar negatively, as we've seen. It's going to push up prices on the margin. And so slower economy, higher inflation, higher interest rates, all things being equal. Now, there's a big caveat with what I do, or there's a qualifier is a better way to put it. The UK was a much more open economy, much more dependent on Europe. The US is more of a closed economy. It depends on the world, but it is, it's different orders of magnitude. So it's same direction, different orders of magnitude. So there's, I think there are a lot of a lot of parallels here. And I guess maybe the other parallel, if I can add one more, which remains to be seen. But the UK, I would say, and you'll get, I'll get hate mail from UK, some UK listeners, but I would say, based on the polling, it's pretty well understood that the economic impact of Brexit has been negative in the UK. Let's say, two-thirds of the people now understand that. But the path back to being closer to Europe is very difficult politically. It's hard to build rebuild that consensus. They move very slowly. And you think about the situation in the world right now for the UK, boy, there's a lot of logic being closer to Europe from trade perspective. And even from a security perspective, they built this sort of what's called a coalition of the willing with respect to Ukraine because the UK, the US is pulling back from support for Ukraine. By the way, Canada has stepped up and is part of that largely European coalition of the willing alongside Australia. So there's a logic to going back to that, but it's hard to go back once you've broken up these relationships. And so the next six, yes, 12 months in my judgment, are going to be quite important for the United States and for the global trading system. Because the question is, okay, we understand that there's a there, there is a big change or big break with the old system. But how much of a break is it going to be? And is there going to be a relatively open trading system for, yeah, I'm using quotations here for those listening, like-minded countries, broadly like-minded countries? You know, I think of the G7 as being pretty like-minded countries. Not surprisingly, you know, we value liberty, free speech, open markets in general. So are we going to have a relatively open system amongst ourselves? Or is it only going to be with a few countries? Or is it going to be with no countries? I mean, that's kind of what to play for here. And but the system won't, it won't revert to what it was previously.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我们谈论这些关税时，有一种普遍的感觉，或者说**特朗普**政府的一种说法是，美国被包括加拿大在内的贸易伙伴利用了，他们只是得到了更好的交易。关税将有助于恢复关系中的某种对等或公平。请回应这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When we're talking about these tariffs, there's a general sense that, or a talk track from the Trump administration, that the US has been taken advantage of by trading partners, including Canada, that they've just got the better end of the deal. And the tariffs will help restore some sort of parity or equity in the relationship. Respond to that.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我的意思是，我们显然不这么认为。我们不这么认为的原因如下，因为实际上，**特朗普**政府定义“被利用”的方式是，您是否存在贸易逆差？我们可以争论这个定义，如果我根据我的经济学训练和经验，我会说，这不是被利用，而是互惠互利。但美国对我们有顺差。美国卖得更多。如果有人被利用，那我们才是被利用了，因为我的意思是，根据那个定义。他们唯一出现逆差的地方是，是的，我们确实向美国运送石油。现在，我们碰巧以远低于全球价格的折扣向美国运送石油。所以，根据那个定义，我们再次被利用了。在商品贸易方面，我们因为以低于良好价格出售石油而被利用。所以，我们，你知道，我们，我们想要回我们的钱。不，我们没有，我们仍然看到这种关系的更广泛利益。而且，你知道，我不认为我会回到汽车行业。如果这些关税继续存在，它不会觉得被利用了。而且，正如您所说，您必须时不时地查看手机，看看情况如何。美国汽车零部件方面可能有一个豁免正在出台，我们本来会说，我们从一开始就说过，这必须发生，否则整个系统都会停滞不前。所以，一些互惠互利正在变得越来越明显，希望美国政府能够继续保持灵活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Well, I mean, we don't obviously, we don't see it. We don't see it in the following respects, because really, again, the way the Trump administration is defined. Being quote, "taken advantage of" is, do you run a trade deficit? And we can argue about that definition, I wouldn't. If I lead on my economic training and my experience, I would say, well, that isn't being taken advantage of, it's mutual exchange. But the US runs a surplus with us. US sells more. What if anyone's being taken advantage of, we're being taken advantage of, right, because I mean, by that definition? And the only place where they run a deficit is, yes, we do ship oil to the United States. Now we happen to ship oil to the United States at a big discount to global prices. So we're being taken advantage of again on that definition. On the, on the goods trade side. And we're getting taking advantage because we're selling oil at below good prices. So, we, you know, we, we want our money back. No, we don't where we still see the broader benefits of the relationship. And, you know, I don't think that I'll go back to the auto sector. Yeah. It's not going to feel taken advantage of as if these tariffs stay in place. And you know, as you say, you got to check your phone every once in a while, just to see where things stand. There's a possible exemption on the auto parts side that's coming in in the United States, which we would have said, right, what we did say, right from the start, would have to happen because the whole system will grind into a halt without it. So some of the mutual advantages will become more, or becoming more apparent, and hopefully, the US administration can continue to be nimble.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的理解是，您向我们运送廉价能源或廉价石油。您显然是一个资源丰富的国家。我们运用我们的知识产权和炼油能力，然后以三倍的价格出售。这听起来对双方都非常有利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. My understanding is that you ship us cheap energy or cheap oil. You're, obviously, a very resource abundant nation. We apply our IP and refining capability, and then we sell it at three times the cost. It sounds like it's been pretty mutually beneficial.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Yep, no, that's absolutely right.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为这将如何发展？如果您要推测全球贸易和关税在宏观层面上的关系，以及具体到加拿大和美国的关系，当您试图像CEO规划业务一样规划经济时，您期望什么？您必须进行情景规划，没有人知道。但您认为这种发展最可能的情景是什么？因为我的意思是，总理，我们都对此感到困惑。大多数懂经济学的人都很难看出这对美国来说是一场巨大的胜利。我们只是，我们很难理解我们如何在这里获胜。也许今天会有更多人来，他们声称有75个国家排队与他们达成协议。您是否觉得各国现在正排队与我们达成协议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you see this playing out? If you were attempted to speculate what the relationship is around global trade and tariffs on a macro level, and then specifically with Canada and the US. When, when you try to plan an economy similar to way the CEO tries to plan a business. What are you expecting? You have to do scenario planning. Nobody knows. But, what do you think are the most likely scenarios for how this plays out? Because I mean, this is seriously Prime Minister. We're all befuddled by this. The majority of people who understand economics are having a difficult time seeing how this is a big win for the US. We're just, we're having a difficult time understanding how we win here. Maybe more people come to the today. They claim there's 75 nations lining up to cut deals with them. Is that the sense you get that nations are lining up to cut a deal with us right now?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，简短的回答是“我不知道”。这个“我不知道”是针对第二个问题的。这里会发生几件事。第一，美国资产存在一种以前没有的**风险溢价**。问题是，这种风险溢价会卖到多高？会卖到哪里？这部分将取决于新体系的连贯性如何。美国是否可靠地致力于建立一个新体系或一系列协议？请记住，我们与美国有一个贸易协议，是由现任总统签署的，但并未得到遵守。所以我认为这是一件事，即美国资产存在风险溢价。如果美国资产存在风险溢价，那么世界各地所有其他资产的成本就会更高，对吧？因为我们仍然以美国国债等为基准定价。所以，我认为这是一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Well, short answer, I don't know. This "I don't know" is on that second question. There's a few things that happen here. One is that there's a risk premium in US assets that wasn't there before. And the question is, how big is that risk premium going to sell? Where is it going to sell? And that, in part, is going to depend on how coherent the new system is, you. And is there, does the US credibly commit to a new system or a series of deals? Remember, we're, you know, we have, we have a trading deal with US that was signed by the current president and which isn't being observed. So I think that's one thing, is there's a risk premium on US assets. And if there's a risk premium on US assets, then the cost of all other assets around the world is greater, right? Like since we're still priced off of, price off of US treasuries, for example. So that's one thing, I think.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 第二，我确实相信有一系列志同道合的国家。我们非常希望美国能成为这个群体的一部分，但这些志同道合的国家将因此发展更深入的贸易和安全关系。这是一个次优选择的世界。这不是我们都想要的，但这是合乎逻辑的做法。第三件会发生的事情是，我们将更加关注国内需求驱动因素，我确信这一点，如果我的政党在选举中获胜，这将成为事实。所以，在国内建设，建设大型基础设施，建设数百万套住房，发展我们自己的经济，更多的国内采购。在一个我们拥有过剩钢铁和铝产能的世界里，如果美国不改变贸易政策，我们就会有。那么，猜猜我们会购买谁的钢铁和铝用于各种用途？猜猜我们现在会进行什么样的国防采购？我们现在大约75%的国防开支流向美国，如果我们与美国建立更疏远的关系，这就不太合理了。如果这对我们是如此，那么对欧洲、对英国也是如此。所以，我们都将更多地转向国内，并更多地相互合作。这种程度的发生。所以，这是一个世界，明确地说，我想您从一开始就直观地理解了。我们生活在一个风险溢价更高的世界，对吧？资本成本更高。我们生活在一个人们正在做次优选择的世界。各国正在做次优选择。所以，这是一个更昂贵的世界。而且它更，它不是自给自足的，用一个花哨的词来说。它不是完全自给自足的，但您正在更加强调照顾好自己，我们将这样做，并将与志同道合的国家一起前进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Second is I do believe that there are a series of like-minded countries. We very much like the US to be part of that group, but like-minded countries who will develop deeper trading and security relationships as a consequence of this. It's the world of second best. It's not what we would all want, but it's the logical thing to do. Third thing that's going to happen is that there is going to be much greater focus, and I know this for a fact, well, this will be a fact if my party is successful in the elections, a much greater focus on domestic drivers of demand. So building at home, building big infrastructure, building millions of houses, building, building out our own economies, more domestic procurement, right? In a world where we've got excess steel and aluminum capacity, which we will. If the US doesn't change on trade. Well, guess whose steel and aluminum we're going to buy for a variety of things? Guess what defense procurement we're going to do? Right now, we spend about 75% of our defense dollars go to the United States. That, you know, doesn't make a lot of sense if we settle out in a in a more arm's length relationship with the US. And that's true. If it's true for us, it's true for Europe, it's true for the UK. And so we'll all move more domestic and more with each other. And the degree to which that happens. So this is a world, just to be clear, and you, I think you intuitively understand what you get this from the start. We've got a world where we have higher risk of premium, right? It's cost of capital is more expensive. And we've got a world where people are doing second best things. Countries are doing second best things. So it's a world that's more expensive. And it's more, it's not autarkic, to use a fancy word. Like, it's not totally in and of yourself, but it's you're putting much greater emphasis on taking care of yourself. We'll do that and we'll do it with like-minded countries. And move forward.

</details>

**主持人**: 正如**埃弗雷特**所说，三分之二的美国人仍然认为加拿大是盟友。我们有点，你知道，**特朗普**，让男孩们做男孩们的事。我们仍然爱加拿大人，但三分之二以上的加拿大人不再视美国为盟友。我的意思是，坦率地说，加拿大人感到被“背叛”了。即使我们能够恢复正常，刀子不是已经拔出一半了吗？但这种伤害需要数年或数十年才能愈合。我的意思是，加拿大人对美国人的看法如何？您认为修复这种关系需要多长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The survey, as Everett said, that two-thirds of Americans still think of Canada as an ally. We sort of, I, you know, Trump, let boys will be boys. We still love Canadians, but two-thirds plus of Canadians no longer see the US as an ally. I mean, quite frankly, it feels like Canadians are just pissed off that they feel the term used was betrayed. And that even if we're, even if we're able to establish, go back to normal, hasn't the knife, you know, isn't it? The knife gets pulled halfway out of the back. But this injury takes years or decades to heal. I mean, what is the vibe, if you will, around how Canadians feel about Americans? And how long do you think it gets, it takes us to repair this relationship?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 我当然承认这些数字。这里有一种感觉，那就是美国的行动。有几件事。一是贸易行动。其次是这段漫长的时期。我不会重复那些用过的短语，但这些对我们主权的威胁，非常独特。只有我们和**丹麦**遭受过实际的主权威胁。我想**巴拿马**也算在内。这在您的背叛等级中，威胁他国主权几乎是最高的。我想最高的是付诸行动。所以这些都混杂在一起。其次，令人震惊的是，美国对这些措施的反应相对平淡。对吧？你知道，如果我可以这样说，CEO阶层，其他主要影响者、利益相关者。这正在发生一些变化。但在很长一段时间内，它都相当安静。所以，你知道，当您从边境的这一侧看时，您会想，哦，好吧，这更根深蒂固，或者友谊的基础不那么牢固。就像任何关系一样，我认为当您失去信任时，它可以在一定程度上修复。这需要一段时间，也需要行动来修复，对吧？但是，你知道，这不仅仅是五个字。我认为这种行动可以从五月开始，届时加拿大总理将与**特朗普总统**会面。我希望届时能成为加拿大总理，我正在为此努力，他们将坐下来，开始重新定义这种关系并从中建立信任的过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: I certainly recognize those figures. There is a feeling here that, that he, it's the actions of the US. There's, there's several things. One is the trade action. Secondly, was this long period. And I'm, I'm not going to repeat the phrases that were used, but these threats to our sovereignty, our very sovereignty, which, you know, kind of unique. There's us and Denmark, who've suffered, yeah, actual threats to sovereignty. I guess Panama, we roll ourselves in with that. And that's, you know, on your hierarchy of betrayals, threatening somebody else's sovereignty pretty much to the top. I guess the top is acting on that threat. So, so that's all mixed in. I think. Secondly, what has been striking has been the relatively muted response in the broader US to these steps, right? You know, the CEO class, if I can put it that way, the other major influencers, stakeholders. And the, that's changing a bit. But it was pretty quiet for a long period of time. So, you know, and when you look at that from this side of the board, you think, oh, okay, well, this is more deeply held, or the friendship is less firmly rooted. It's like any relationship, I think if it's when you have a loss of trust. You, it can be repaired to a degree. It takes a period of time, and it takes action to repair, right? But, you know, it's more than more than five words. I, I think that, that action can start with in May, the Prime Minister of Canada at that point will meet with President Trump. I want to be the Prime Minister of Canada at that point, I'm working hard to get there, and they'll sit down and start a process of redefining that relationship and building trust out from that.

### 加拿大的经济挑战与未来愿景

**主持人**: 好的，我们回到**卡尼总理**的更多内容。所以，仅仅是为了利用我们邀请您参加这个播客的机会，美国现在面临着收入不平等的真正问题，这是我们国家历史上第一次，一个30岁的年轻人不如他的父母在30岁时过得好。政治两极分化严重。人们彼此不喜欢。我认为相对而言，国家实际上做得相当不错。但是，是什么困扰着我们，问题出在内部。我们美国人彼此不喜欢。您被邀请成为一名熟练工，来担任财政部长或**美联储**主席。您认为美国应该采取什么政策计划？然后我想以此为起点，谈谈加拿大面临的最大经济挑战以及您计划如何解决它们。

<details>

**主持人**: We're back with more from Prime Minister Carney. So, just as a means of not or taking advantage of the fact that we have you on this podcast, we have real problems in the US around income inequality. For the first time in our nation's history, a 30-year-old isn't doing as well as his or her parents was at 30. Tremendous polarization politically. People don't like each other. And I would argue that comparatively, the nation's actually done quite well. But what ails us, the cause coming from inside of the house, we don't like each other within America. You're asked to be a journeyman and come be Treasury Secretary, head of the Fed. What policy plans do you think the US should adopt? And then I want to use that as a jumping off point to what are the biggest economic challenges Canada faces and how you plan to address them?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 好的，我认为，您触及了核心。我的意思是，这是一个非常大的问题。我想我从一个奇怪的角度来看待它，但当我审视未来25年将推动经济繁荣和生产力增长的因素时，这些主要驱动力是什么？我列出了三个主要驱动力：**人工智能**，毫无疑问，我将其列在首位；可能是**生命科学革命**，我在这方面专业知识较少；以及**碳**，我指的是向低碳发展的动力。美国目前已经退了一步，但它会回来，因为潜在的问题依然存在。所以，如果这些是未来推动经济发展的一些重要因素，而美国可以在所有这些方面都掌握主动权。但问题是，这些成果将在美国各种社会阶层中如何广泛分享？人们准备好利用它了吗？所以，你知道，**人工智能**会是纯粹的精英操作，还是主要由精英操作？或者**人工智能**会被用来培训很多人做很多事情？我的意思是，我知道这听起来很乐观，很技术乐观。但问题是，这是否是一项由联邦和地方政府引导的深思熟虑的政策，以确保在**阿巴拉契亚**地区，您正在学习与此相符的技能。或者，你知道，随着时间的推移进行能源转型，但据我所知，这在美国不再是一个常用词，但它会回来。如果我能把它转回我们这里，我们面临着同样的问题或驱动因素。这些是全球驱动因素。除此之外，我们还有一系列事情，例如我提到的**关键矿产**。我们有大量的传统能源。那么，我们如何平衡所有这些，以一种在发展过程中创造就业机会的方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Well, I think the, okay, you go to the heart of, I mean, that's a big, big question. I guess the way I look at it is as follows. I, I'm going to come at this from an odd angle, maybe, but when I look at what's going to drive economic prosperity, productivity growth for the next 25 years? What are the big drivers of that? I put down three big drivers: AI, no insight. I put at the top of the list, probably the life sciences revolution, where I'm less less expert, and, and I would put carbon. I would put drive towards lower carbon. The US has taken a step back from that for the moment, but it's going to come back because the underlying issues around are there. And so, okay, if those are some of the big things that are going to drive economies going forward, and the US can have mastery in all of those. But the question is, how broadly that's going to be shared within the US across various social strata? And how ready people are going to be to take advantage of it, right? So, you know, is AI going to be, you know, purely an elite or largely an elite operation? Or is AI going to be used to train a lot of people to do a number of things? I mean, I know that sounds very Panglossian and, you know, techno optimistic. But it is the question is whether it's a deliberate policy that's steered by by the federal and local governments in a way that are going to ensure that, you know, in Appalachia, you're learning skills that are consistent with that. And or, you know, the energy transition over time, but it's not a term that's used anymore in the US, as far as I can tell, but it will come back. If I can flip it back to us. We have the same set of issues or set of drivers. Those are global drivers. On top of that, we have a series of things, such as I mentioned critical minerals. We have large conventional energy. So how are we balancing all that in a way that builds the jobs as we move out?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 我再说两件相关但不同的事情。我们必须解决这个国家的**住房问题**。我们有一个巨大的经济需求，我们有一个绝对的社会需求，但我们也有一个巨大的经济机会来创造一个新产业，一种大规模建造房屋的新方式，并推动它。我们将在这方面努力。我想我最后要说的是，坦率地说，我对美国有点担忧，但它给了加拿大更大的安慰或力量，这是一个我不确定您是否喜欢再用的词，那就是**多元化**。我们这里有一个巨大的机会，因为我们是世界上最多元化的国家之一。我们重视多元化，再次，在广义上非常重视平等权利。我们可以成为人才的磁石。当美国正在“排斥”人才时，你知道，现在美国的学术界环境相当敌对，我们可以利用这一点。然后，这会通过**人工智能革命**、**生命科学**以及其他元素层层传递下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: One of the things, I'll say two other things, which are related but distinct. We've got to sort out our housing issues in this country. We have a massive economic, we have an absolute social need, but we have a massive economic opportunity to create a new industry, new way of building houses and at scale and driving that. And we're going to, we're going to shoot on that. And I guess the last thing I'd say, which, yeah, candidly worries me a bit about the United States and gives me greater comfort or strength in Canada is a word I'm not sure you like to use anymore, which is around diversity. We have a huge, huge opportunity here because we're one of the most diverse countries in the world. You value diversity, again, give a very strong sense of equal rights in a broad sense. We can be a magnet for talent. And as the US is pushing out brains, if you will, and, you know, it's quite a hostile environment in the academic world in the United States. Now, we can take advantage of that. And then that cascades down through, you know, the AI revolution, life sciences, other other elements.

**主持人**: 是的，播客主、创意阶层，斯科特，来这里吧。无论是现在，现在已经超过0了。创意在这方面做了很多工作，总理。所以，你看，您有住房危机。我们有住房危机。而且领导人似乎在过去10年里都认为这是一个危机。现在，我读到**温哥华**的房价占平均工资的比例是世界上第三高的城市。而且其中很大一部分在于分区和邻避效应。您的前任总理，他们也想解决住房危机。摩擦点是资本还是劳动力？是分区吗？您提出的方案与前几届政府相比有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Podcasters, creative class, Scott, come up here. Whether it's now, it's now above zero. Creative has done a lot of work in that. So, and Prime Minister. So that look, you have a housing crisis. We have a housing crisis. And it seems like leaders have agreed that it's a crisis for the last 10 years. Now, I read that housing of Vancouver as a percentage of the average salary is the third most expensive city in the world. And that so much of it is in zoning and NIMBYism. And your, the previous Prime Minister, you know, they wanted to address the housing crisis. What's the friction point? Is it capital? Is it labor? Is it zoning? What is different about what you're proposing that is going to register any more progress than previous administrations?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 所以，它是以上所有因素。因此，您需要以全面的方式解决它。我将简化为限制分区开发费用。我们在多个政府层面开展工作，这也是这些成本存在的部分原因。它们来自市政方面。因此，实际上，我们投入了大量资金，承诺将开发费用削减一半。好的，这取决于一系列其他限制的解除。但我们联邦政府将支付将其削减一半的费用。第二件事是，我们坚信加拿大住房部门，即建筑部门的生产力在过去20年里基本停滞不前。我们仍然像以前一样建造房屋。鉴于我们需要做的事情的规模，我们必须更快地行动，特别是在城市密度和其他方面。所以，模块化预制房屋、**大块木材**和其他创新技术已经存在。因此，我们要做的一件事就是启动这个行业，这是加拿大，而不是美国。我们对这些事情有不同的态度。我们面临着深度可负担住房的问题，对吧？某些国家可能称之为社会住房。我们几十年来基本上没有建造过这种住房。所以我们需要迎头赶上。因此，我们正在做的一部分工作是，我们将在那个层面建造大量住房，并设定规范。我们将作为开发商，在我们的资产负债表上进行建造，并为此设定规范，这将推动预制、**大块木材**等上游产业的发展，从而实现规模经济。但总的来说，我们将依靠私营部门建造，提供大量土地，提供廉价资本，在这种情况下为开发商提供250亿美元，这在这里是一笔巨款，将开发费用削减一半，推动这一进程。然后，我们将为首次购房者提供税收减免。所以基本上，他们首次购房可以获得5%的折扣，从首付的角度来看，这开始累积起来。所以，从供需两方面着手。我们看待它的方式是，这是一个世代问题。问题的规模是世代性的，以至于我们正在培养大量的**熟练技工**学徒，我几乎每次发言都会传达的核心信息之一就是，现在是加拿大从事**熟练技工**职业的绝佳时机，因为我们将在未来25到30年里进行建设。如果我们做得对，我们打算将投资占GDP的比重提高三到四个百分点。这是一个巨大的数字，对吧？这是可能的。我们在70年代初曾以这种规模相对于GDP进行投资。我们可以再次做到。我们知道我们可以为其融资。我们有所有的养老基金。我们有很多钱可以为其融资，但我们需要启动它。当然，这不仅仅是住房。我们从住房开始，但它不仅仅是住房，还有能源，还有其他元素，但这就是我们要做的。所以，我们希望让年轻人大规模地进入**熟练技工**行业。我们将支付他们所有的学徒费用。我们将与工会合作，帮助他们完成学业。我们正在增加高等教育的容量，以便他们能够大规模地获得这些技能。所以我们正在达到数十万的规模，这在美国可能看起来不多，但在加拿大，这些是很大的数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: So, it's it's all of the above. And so you attack it in in a comprehensive way. I'm going to simplify in terms of restrict zoning development charges. And we work at multiple levels of government is part of the reason why those costs are there. They come from the municipal side. And so in effect, we put up a bunch of money, just put up a bunch of money to commit to cut the development charges in half. Okay. So and that's subject to a series of other restrictions being removed. But we will, we at the federal level will pay for that to be cut in half. The second thing, I mean, we believe very strongly that productivity in the Canadian housing sector, construction sector, basically is flatlined for the last 20 years. We're still building houses like we did before. And, given the scale of what we need to do, we got to move much more rapidly, particularly in urban density and other things. So modular prefab, housing, mass timber, other innovations that there they exist. And so one of the things we're going to do to kickstart that industry, and this is Canada's not the United States. We have a different attitude toward these things. We have a problem with deeply affordable housing, right? Social, certain countries, you might call social housing. We just have not built that for decades, basically in effect. And so we need to, we need to catch up. And so what we're doing, part of what we're doing is we're going to build huge amount at that level and set the the specs, if you will. For that. Yeah. We're going to build and we're going to build by, you know, on our balance sheet as a developer, and we'll set the specs for that, which drive the industry upstream in prefab, mass, timber, et cetera, which gets the economies to scale there. But, by and large, we will rely on private sector build, will make a bunch of land available, of make cheap capital, 25 billion for developers in this case, which is bigger money up here, cut those development charges in half, drive that. And then we will give tax breaks to people buying their first time home. So basically, they're getting 5% off their first first time home, which, from a down payment perspective, starts starts to add up. So attacking it both on the supply demand side. The way we look at it. Is, this is generational. Like the scale of the problem is generational, such that we are building out a huge pipeline of apprentices in the skilled trades, and one of the core messages I give up virtually every time I speak, so I'm going to do it now, is this is going to be a great time for a career in the skilled trades in Canada because we're going to build for the next 25, 30 years. Like we are going to add, if we get this right, and we intend to, three to four points of GDP of investment. That's a huge number, right? It's possible. We used to invest at that scale relative to GDP. In the early 70s. We can do it again. We know we can finance it. We've got all the pension funds. We've got lots of money to finance it, but we need to, we need to kickstart it. And of course, it's not, it's housing. We start with housing. It's not just housing. It's energy. It's other other elements, but that's what we're going to do. So we want to get young people into the skilled trades at scale. We're going to pay for all their apprenticeships. We're going to work with the unions to pull them through. We're adding a bunch of capacity at post-secondary education. So they can get these trades at a scale. So we're getting to hundreds of thousands, which again, in the US doesn't seem like a lot. And in Canada, these are big numbers.

### 气候与能源战略

**主持人**: 让我们谈谈气候和能源。您已经从气候金融倡导者转变为取消消费者碳税，并呼吁加拿大成为能源超级大国。您对这些问题的看法有何变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Let's talk a little bit about climate and energy. You've evolved from being a climate finance advocate to scrapping the consumer carbon tax and calling for Canada to be an energy superpower. How have your views changed on those?

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 是的，老实说，我不会说我的观点改变了。所以，我的意思是，它非常注重结果。加拿大的**消费者碳税**只占我们减排量的约6%。所以94%的工作是在其他地方完成的。它确实向家庭发出了一个信号。但它并不是那么重要。但它非常有争议，因为人们将其视为一种税收，他们看到了税收，却没有完全认可他们获得的退税。所以它在政治上没有帮助，削弱了整体信息。所以我们在几个月前取消了它，这实际上是我上任后做的第一件事。但我们正在做的是确保大型排放企业的**碳市场**运作良好。是的。所以，我们确保大型排放企业运作良好。因此，如果我们当选，我们实际上会让他们为人们支付，你知道，驾驶电动汽车、改造房屋以及其他气候智能选择的费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: Yeah. I wouldn't, I wouldn't say my views have changed to be honest. So, I mean, it's, it's very results oriented. So the consumer carbon tax in Canada was responsible for about 6% of our emissions reduction. So 94% of the work was being done elsewhere. Now, it sent a signal to households. But it, it, it just wasn't, yeah, that important. But it was quite divisive, because people, you know, viewed it as a tax, and they they saw the tax with the tax. They didn't all give credit to the rebates that they were getting. So it politically was unhelpful, was undercutting the overall message. So we got rid of that a few months ago, was first thing I did actually, when I got into office. But, what we, what we are doing is making sure that the carbon market for large emitters works well. Yeah. So. And and we large emitters work well. And as a consequence of that, we're getting them in effect to pay people for, this is what will happen if we're elected, to pay people for, you know, driving EVs, retrofitting their homes, the other, you know, climate smart choices.

</details>

**马克·卡尼**: 除此之外，我们的气候战略中有一个很大的要素，一个**IRA**（通胀削减法案）类型的要素，即投资税收抵免等。所以我们基本上正在寻求并取得了合理的成功，我们联邦政府投入一美元，就能在此基础上获得四到五美元的私人投资。而且，你知道，对我们真正重要的是什么？除了关心气候，这里的人们总体上确实关心气候。那就是我们认为这将是竞争力的根本驱动力。如果您看看我们未来将更多地与谁进行贸易，欧洲人、英国人以及其他人，猜猜他们关心什么？事实上，正如您所知，**碳边境调节机制**正在欧洲实施。所以我们认为，好吧，我们必须在中长期内这样做以保持竞争力，因为世界正在朝着这个方向发展。其次，欧洲人和其他人会希望我们这样做。第三，实际上，我们拥有很多技术。所以，成为能源超级大国的一部分是关于**小型模块化反应堆**。我的意思是，我们拥有大量**水力发电**。我们在**氢能**方面表现不错。我们可以做得更好的**碳捕获和储存**。所有这些我们都能做到。我想最后一点，回到美国，你知道，现在，我将大致概括一下，美国不关心气候。六个月前，我们关心气候。猜猜未来您会再次关心气候。当您未来再次关心气候时，我们希望处于一个更具竞争力的位置，也许已经超越了一些美国公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**马克·卡尼**: And then on top of that, there is a big element, big IRA type element to our climate strategy, investment tax and credits and others. So we're looking basically and having reasonable success with this, where we're putting out, you know, a dollar federally, and we're getting four to five dollars of private investment on top of that. And, you know, what's really relevant to us? Aside from caring about the climate and people up here, do care about the climate as a whole. Is that we think that this is going to be a fundamental driver of competitiveness. And if you look at who we're going to be trading with more over time, Europeans, the Brits, others, guess what they care about this? In fact, as you know, carbon border adjustment mechanism is coming into in Europe. And so we take a view that, okay, we've got to do this medium long term for competitiveness because that's where the world's going. Secondly, the Europeans and others are going to want us to do this. Thirdly, actually, we've got a lot of the technology. So part of being an energy superpower is around small modular reactors. I mean, we're big hydropower. We're decent on hydrogen. We could get better carbon capture and storage. All these things we can do. And I guess the last point, which goes back to the US is, you know, right now, and I'm going to grossly generalize, the US doesn't care about climate. Six months ago, we cared about climate. Guess what? You're going to care about climate again down the road. And when you care about climate down the road again, we want to be in a position where we're much more competitive and maybe have leapfrogged a number of US companies.

I mean, I think that is the only real legacy, the extent to which you have influenced how others treat others in the world, and how they, how they react in the world. That's, I wrote a book, and that was the that was the conclusion of that.

**主持人**: Mark Carney is Canada's 24th Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, sworn in this March. As an economist, Prime Minister Carney steered the Bank of Canada through the financial crisis, and later became the first non-Brit to run the Bank of England. Between those roles, he served as UN Special Envoy to Climate Action and Finance, and as Vice Chair of Brookfield Asset Management. I trust a lot of Canadians are listening. And I feel comfortable speaking for a lot of people, and that is Americans understand the largest undefended border in the world is the US Canadian border. That's for a reason. I love that question that a Warren Buffett's friend was a Holocaust survivor, said, "The way I judge my friends is I asked one question: who would hide me?" A lot of Americans remember that Canadians hid Americans in the Iran hostage crisis. And I hope that your listeners and your voters recognize there is a huge swath of Americans that think of you not not of even as a friend, but as siblings. And that we hope and are committed to maintaining what is arguably one of the strongest alliances in history that I don't want to say, don't take what's going on seriously, you have to, but there are a lot of Americans down here who are brothers and sisters in arms in Canada. We really do think of you as a sibling. Thank you, Scott.
