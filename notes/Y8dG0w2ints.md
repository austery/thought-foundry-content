title: 戴姆勒卡车CEO Karin Rådström：百年巨头的电动化、自动驾驶与文化转型之路
---

### 戴姆勒卡车：全球商用车巨头的转型之路

今天，我们非常荣幸地邀请到戴姆勒卡车公司（Daimler Truck）的首席执行官兼总裁Karin Rådström。戴姆勒卡车是全球最大的商用车生产商。Karin最近被评为瑞典最重要的女商人，她正在戴姆勒卡车推动公司从传统的柴油车巨头转型为面向未来的移动出行强企。Karin结合了工程学背景和精英体育背景，我们向她表示热烈欢迎。

<p class="english-text">So today we are in very good company with Ken Rolstrom the CEO and president of Daimler Truck which is the largest commercial vehicle producer in the world. Ken has recently been named Sweden's most important businesswoman and Dino Truck and at Daimler Truck she is driving the conversion of legacy diesel champion into a future ready mobility powerhouse. Now uh Colleen you combine uh engineering background background with a background in elite sport. So a warm welcome.</p>
</details>

Karin Rådström表示感谢，随后主持人提出一个情景：假设他们两人坐在一辆卡车里，主持人坐在驾驶座上，Karin坐在旁边。主持人请Karin描述一辆好的卡车应该具备哪些特质，以及她会关注哪些方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. So now you and I, we are going into a truck. Okay. You are sitting in the in the driving seat. I'm sitting next to you. And now you're going to tell me what what makes a good truck. What what do you what do you look for?</p>
</details>

Karin解释说，驾驶室就像是司机的“客厅”。她主要关注其实用性，例如是否有足够的储物空间，床的舒适度，以及司机与卡车的互动方式。她认为，尽管电动化和数字化带来了新的趋势，但驾驶室作为司机的“客厅”和“移动办公室”这一本质并未改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh well, the cab is like the driver's living room. Yeah. So that's what I look for basically. Is it practical? Is there storage space? How's the bed? Of course. Also, how do you interact with with the truck? Um, yeah, but I honestly I was thinking it didn't really change so much with all the new trends with electrification, digitalization. It's it's still a living room and a working office.</p>
</details>

### 客户决策与市场驱动因素

主持人接着问道，当人们购买卡车时，他们会关注哪些决定性因素，以及戴姆勒卡车如何赢得客户的青睐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When people buy a truck, uh, what do they look what what what are the decisive elements? What is it that make you win the the purchase?</p>
</details>

Karin认为，这取决于从哪个角度看。从司机角度，驾驶室和生活空间很重要。但卡车本身的功能性也很关键，司机们仍然希望自己的卡车在爬坡时比其他品牌的同事更快，这仍然很重要。然而，最终决定购买品牌的通常是车主，他们更关注卡车的运营成本，因为他们经营的是一门生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, well, I think it depends who which perspective you take. So now we started with like the driver perspective which is the cab and the living space but of course also that the truck does the job and I think they're still kind of old school so they want to go faster up the hill than their colleague with the other brand. So that's still important. Uh but then of course usually the people deciding which brand to buy are the owners and they look for the whatever truck will give them the best cost of operation because they're running a business. So</p>
</details>

主持人询问司机和车主的观点是否存在巨大差异。Karin回答说有时会有，但通常来说，如果一家公司在研发上投入，拥有好的发动机和动力系统，能提供良好的运营成本，那么这些品牌通常也会为司机提供更好的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is there a big difference between the two views? So the driver and the owner sometimes. Yeah. But uh generally I think if you have good cost of operation means you invest into R&D, you have a good engine, good powertrain, generally the same brands also do more for the drivers. So</p>
</details>

戴姆勒卡车将市场分为轻型、中型和重型卡车。Karin表示，公司主要专注于重型卡车，但通过旗下的一些品牌，他们也能提供全系列产品。例如，日本品牌**Fuso**在轻型卡车市场表现强劲，而**Western Star**和**Freightliner**则涵盖了重型和部分中型卡车。全球范围内，重型卡车至少占其业务的50%至60%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you um split it into segments of light, medium and and heavy. And where so where are you positioned? So we mainly focus on heavy duty but we we are a full liner with some of our brands. Um so for instance with with our Japanese brand Fuzo we are very strong on light duty. Um with Western Star in Freightlininer um we have both heavy duty but also some medium duty. So but I would say globally probably 50 60% at least heavy duty.</p>
</details>

关于盈利模式，Karin希望公司能通过销售卡车和提供服务两方面盈利。她指出，与一些竞争对手相比，戴姆勒卡车在服务方面有更大的提升空间。在三年前戴姆勒还是一个大型企业集团（包括梅赛德斯-奔驰轿车）时，许多服务业务都是通过母公司完成的，而现在戴姆勒卡车正在迎头赶上并发展这一领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you make money? Is it by selling the trucks or is it by servicing them or repair or what is it? hopefully both. But uh for sure like one of the upsides that we have as Daimler truck compared to some of our competitors is we can get even better with services. Um where basically in the old structure that we had in Daimler which was a big conglomerate you know with Mercedes-Benz cars until three years ago a lot of the service stuff was done through the mothership. Um, so that's something I think we're catching up and we're developing right now and growing.</p>
</details>

主持人询问卡车市场的周期性及其驱动因素，以及在什么时期销量会更高。Karin解释说，卡车市场通常与整体经济并行。当人们投资建筑项目时，就需要卡车；当人们订购更多商品时，也需要卡车来运输。她甚至认为，卡车行业的表现有时能提前反映整体经济的走向，因为他们能看到卡车的运行里程以及客户的购买行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How cyclical is the market and I mean what are what are the drivers? What what do you look at in which times are you selling more trucks? Uh, generally it runs pretty much in parallel with the overall economy. So you know when people are investing into building projects, construction, they need trucks. Uh, if people are ordering more goods to parcels or whatever, you need trucks to bring them to the people. So I would say overall it just generally really follows the or even I would say sometimes we know early how the general economy is going to develop because we see the how much the trucks are running and we see the buying and purchase behavior of our customers.</p>
</details>

当被问及当前的市场状况时，Karin坦言情况并不乐观，市场非常缓慢。她认为，在美国，目前经济存在很大的不确定性，而这种不确定性对客户来说从来都不是好事，他们宁愿继续使用现有车队，等待观望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what are you seeing just now? Uh yeah it's not looking so great unfortunately. So it's it's pretty slow market. Um we don't I mean why why is it slow? Um I think in the US at the moment a lot of uncertainty about where the economy is going to go and I think uncertainty is never good for our customers then they rather just run the fleet and they wait</p>
</details>

她强调，购买卡车是客户业务中最重要的投资。而在欧洲，尽管德国的基础设施支出和国防倡议等积极因素很多，但这些尚未在卡车市场中体现出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because it's a big investment right? Yeah it's it's the most important investment they do in their business. Mhm. Um and in Europe like we hear a lot of positive things like you know for instance in Germany we have the infrastructure spending a lot of defense initiatives but so far we don't really see it in in the market.</p>
</details>

### 多品牌战略与文化转型挑战

主持人对戴姆勒卡车拥有众多品牌（如Freightliner、Mercedes、Fuso、Western Star）感到好奇，认为拥有一个品牌可能会更简单。Karin解释说，公司实际上拥有更多品牌，这源于历史原因，每个品牌都代表着对客户不同的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you have so many brands? You got you know Freightlininer Mercedes Fuso Western Star. Easier just to have one. Yeah we have we have even more actually. uh but it it comes from history uh and and they all stand for different things for the customers I would say.</p>
</details>

她举例说，在客车领域，**Setra**的定位甚至高于梅赛德斯-奔驰，其品牌价值更高。在美国，**Western Star**在重型木材和建筑领域是一个非常强大的品牌。因此，保留大多数品牌是有意义的。当然，有时他们也会考虑收购后是否需要改变品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so if I give an example on the coach side we have Cetra which is actually positioned higher than Mercedes-Benz um and that's something we acquired um yeah now many years ago. So that has a higher brand value than Mercedes um for a coach customer. And why why would you take that away or Western Star in the US? That's a super strong brand for like heavy duty timber construction. Um so it makes sense to to keep most brands and then of course sometimes we buy stuff where we might consider changing the brand too.</p>
</details>

随着汽车和卡车行业向更多技术和软件发展，主持人问道，将一家百年老公司转变为一家软件公司是怎样的体验。Karin坦言这并不容易，她不认为戴姆勒卡车会成为一个纯粹的软件公司。但作为首席执行官，她最大的任务之一就是推动文化变革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now we're seeing in uh in cars but also in tracks uh the trend towards uh more technology, more software and so on. How how is it to change a 100 year old company into a software company? Uh it's not easy. I mean we're I I don't think we will become a software company per se. Yeah. Uh but for sure one of the biggest tasks I have as CEO is to drive culture change</p>
</details>

她提到，戴姆勒卡车内部经常谈论“更简单、更快、更强大”（simpler, faster, stronger），尤其需要做到“更简单、更快”，这将使公司变得更强大。他们现有的流程是为产品开发和缓慢周期而设计的，例如开发一台柴油发动机需要五六年。因此，他们现在必须挑战一切。Karin认为，这是她工作中“最困难但也最有趣的部分”，即努力推动这种变革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to make I mean we talk a lot about in diamond the truck about simpler, faster, stronger which is what we especially simper faster is something we need to do and and we need to have in mind in everything we do which will hopefully then make us stronger. Our processes are developed for product development and for kind of slow cycles you know like a diesel engine takes like five six years to develop. Um so we have to challenge everything right now and I think that's the most difficult but also interesting part of my job actually to try to drive that change.</p>
</details>

主持人指出，斯图加特（Stuttgart）并非硅谷，在吸引人才方面面临挑战。Karin分享了她推动文化变革的方法。她认为，文化实际上是一系列公司内部的“实践”。要改变这些实践，首先需要明确目标愿景，即他们想去哪里，比如她提到的“更简单、更快”。这首先是提升员工的意识，例如通过海报、T恤等方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how do you do that? I mean uh Schlutgkart is not exactly Silicon Valley right? So uh you know just in terms of attracting the talent and I think um we I spent a lot of time actually thinking about how to drive culture change um and uh I think we found kind of a good method which is um if you look at culture it's actually just it's a bunch of different practices that you have in a company and in order to change practices you need to look at like acknowledge or or or kind of where what's the target picture? Where do we want to go? And I talked about this simpler faster. So that's like addressing just the awareness of the people kind of you know putting the posters on the wall in the elevator or like uh you know you bring everyone a t-shirt that says simpler, faster, stronger. Uh but then to really drive change you also need to look at like which processes and methods do we have?</p>
</details>

其次，需要审视现有的流程和方法，并思考如何改变它们。第三点，也是最重要但最难把握的，是所有那些不成文但已成为做事方式一部分的“行为”。Karin强调，需要非常坚持不懈地去解决和改变一些关键问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so that's like the structured things and how do we want to change those? And then I think the third thing you need to look at which is maybe the most important but also the hardest to grasp that's like all the behaviors that exist that are not written but that are part of how we do things. Um, well that's the definition of copaculture. to grab them and you have to very I think persistently address and change some of the kind of key key topics. You have to look at all of those.</p>
</details>

主持人询问改变企业文化需要多长时间。Karin认为很难给出确切答案，因为这不是180度的彻底转变。他们不想成为硅谷的初创公司，那样不会成功。但要实现质的飞跃，对于戴姆勒这样一家拥有10.5万名员工的全球性公司来说，可能需要四五年时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How long time do you think it takes to change corpora culture? How long is a string? It's I think really hard to answer because it's it's also not about you've been running in one direction and you move everything 180 degrees. that that's not what we want to do and I don't think we will be successful. We don't want to be like the startup from Silicon Valley because we're not going to be successful if we try to be that company. But I think to really make a step change you probably need four five years in a I mean in a we're also global company 100 5,000 people.</p>
</details>

主持人也认同，即使是700人的公司，文化变革也非一朝一夕之事。他问道，在文化变革中，最困难的部分是什么？Karin认为，在德国背景下，他们对“注重细节”感到非常自豪，这在过去也是他们成功的一部分。但现在，要敢于放手，尝试新事物，并更快地推进工作，这对员工来说是困难的。然而，为了在未来保持竞争力，他们不能再以过去的速度工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously in a smaller company you can do it faster. Yeah. It's still tough. I mean, you know, our company is 700 people and it's still um it's not done overnight. Huh. But what what part of that cultural change do you do you think it's the the toughest? I think being in this German context, we have a lot of pride in in our attention to detail. Um so I think over time that has also been part of our success in the past. But to dare to let go a little bit, to try new things and to push things through a little bit faster is difficult for people. Um so that's something quite challenging but we also see that we cannot work at the speed that we have done if we want to be competitive in the future.</p>
</details>

### 战略重点与软件定义卡车

主持人指出，戴姆勒卡车正处于一个“不可思议的时代”，面临电池技术、气候关注、数字化、互联互通、地缘政治和软件开发等多种趋势。他询问Karin如何优先处理这些问题。Karin表示，这些是普遍的趋势，但戴姆勒卡车作为一家独立公司才成立三四年，仍在努力成为一家独立的实体，推动文化变革并提升业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean you are in a it's it's an incred you are at an incredible time in your business right because you know uh you have a trend towards uh you know uh battery uh focus on climate uh digitalization connectivity uh geopolitics uh software yeah absolutely you know the whole software development so how do you prioritize yeah I would say those are like the general things happening but then at the same time we're just three years old, four years old as a company soon. So we are just becoming like a standalone independent company. Um and we're driving culture change and we need to improve our performance. Um so how do you prioritize? I think it's not that different from in normal times.</p>
</details>

她认为，优先级设定与平时没有太大区别，就是列出需要完成的五件最重要的事情。她通常以半年为周期进行规划，确保完成最重要的事情，这意味着一些同样重要的事情有时不得不等待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to write down what are like the top five things I need to get done. in some perspective. I usually do it like half year cycles and just make sure to really get the most important things done and that also means sometimes some things have to wait that are also important. Um</p>
</details>

谈到软件，Karin表示，如果看今天的卡车，虽然过去几年发生了很多变化，但仍然相当“老式”。卡车中有很多**ECU**（Electronic Control Units: 电子控制单元），多达数百个，每个都控制着不同的功能。这使得开发速度缓慢，因为每次开发新功能都需要同时修改硬件和软件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well let's let's unpick it a bit. Let's start with the software. What are the kind of things you are developing on the software side? Um, but we just I think we're still, if you look at how the truck looks today, for sure a lot happened over the last couple of years, but I would still it's I would say it's still pretty old style. So, we have a lot of um HPUs or we have a lot of ECUs like electronic control units, couple of hundred in the truck and they all steer different functions. Um so that makes us kind of slow because we also code design with our suppliers and we every time we want to develop a new function you need to touch the hardware and the software.</p>
</details>

为此，戴姆勒卡车最近与**沃尔沃**（Volvo）成立了一家新公司，共同开发基础层。他们的目标是拥有几个高性能的中央计算机，然后独立开发软件。这与汽车行业的发展方向非常相似，但卡车需要不同的功能。当这项工作完成，卡车完全由软件驱动时，最大的不同在于可以更多地通过纯软件实现功能，而无需过多地触及卡车硬件，从而大大提高开发速度。同时，卡车上的传感器可以更“笨”，因为计算能力集中在一个单元中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so what we are doing now we just formed a new company um together with Volvo actually um to to do the basic layers together. Um and what we want to do is to have a couple of high performing computers um and then independently develop the software. So it's very much following what the car industry has been moving towards. But it's a little bit different for trucks because we need just different functions. So when when you are done with this work and it's kind of totally software enabled, what what is different? Um what you can do is you can do a lot more things software only. Um so you don't need to touch the hardware in the truck at all as much which makes you much faster. Um and and the sensors in the truck can be dumber because you have the compute really centralized in one unit.</p>
</details>

主持人问道，未来是否会有一天，戴姆勒卡车不再销售卡车，而是销售“正常运行时间”（uptime）。Karin表示，他们正在朝着这个方向发展。目前，他们已经通过全服务租赁合同在一定程度上实现了这一点。在一些城市公交车的招标中，他们甚至提供了公交车运行时间的保证。她认为，电动化带来了很多不确定性，而客户希望降低风险，如果戴姆勒卡车能更好地管理这些风险，就应该能够提供“正常运行时间”服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think there will be a time where you sell uptime and instead of selling the truck you just sell? I mean we we are moving in that direction. We do it to some extent today because we do full service lease contracts. Um so we're definitely going in that direction and I would say already in some city bus tenders we have an uptime guarantee of how how much the the bus should be running. M um and I think it's an opportunity with electrification because it brings so much uncertainty for our customers where all they want to do is take down risk and if we can manage that risk better then um we should be able to offer them uptime. So yes,</p>
</details>

### 自动驾驶与脱碳之路

谈到卡车行业的自动驾驶趋势，Karin认为美国是最佳发展地点，因为那里的司机工资最高，且卡车行驶距离极长。戴姆勒卡车在美国拥有一家名为**Torque**的公司，他们持有93%的股份，负责开发自动驾驶软件。同时，卡车本身也需要进行大量改造，每个系统都需要冗余，以防故障时能切换到冗余制动或转向系统。这部分硬件开发由戴姆勒内部完成，软件则由Torque开发。他们也曾与**Waymo**合作多年，直到Waymo退出卡车业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">tell me about the trend towards uh autonomous vehicles in the truck business. Yeah. Well, I don't know if it's a trend, but it's obviously something where we invest a lot. Um we believe the best place to do it is in the US. Um because I mean first of all the driver wages are the highest. Um and also they drive extremely long distances. Um so we have our own company there called Torque uh which we own to 93% [Music] uh where we're we're developing this u where the software to drive autonomous and then of course you need to do a lot on the truck side. You need to have every system needs to be redundant. So in case there is a failure you need to be able to switch over to you know redundant braking or steering. Um, so that part we develop within Daimler and the software we develop in Torque, but we also work I mean we've worked with Whimo for instance for for many years until they stepped out of trucking.</p>
</details>

主持人询问，与自动驾驶汽车相比，制造自动驾驶卡车是否非常困难。Karin表示，这是一个很好的问题，她也在向专家寻求答案。一方面，卡车主要在高速公路上行驶，情况相对简单，没有那么多“边缘案例”。但另一方面，卡车以每小时90公里的速度行驶，一旦发生事故，后果可能非常严重。她仍在寻找这个问题的最终答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Is so is it very difficult to make a self-driving truck compared to a self-driving car? Very good question. I I'm asking all experts that I'm getting kind of into this myself. So uh on the one hand uh it's easier because it's you know mainly driving on highway. Yeah. So you don't have all these edge cases. But on the other hand, um it's driving, you know, 90 kilometers an hour and if something happens, the the accident can be pretty severe. Um so in the end, I'm still looking for the answer.</p>
</details>

尽管现在一些城市已经有自动驾驶出租车在运行，但自动驾驶卡车尚未普及。Karin预计，到2027-2028年，自动驾驶卡车将在商业线路上投入使用。目前已经有一些测试，他们也进行了很多“无司机”的测试，但仍有安全司机坐在车内。她认为，这一天并不遥远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When do you think when you But I mean, we see robo taxes already today running in some cities and we don't yet see autonomous trucks. So I guess when will we see it? When will we see Oh, I think uh 27 28 in commercial um lines. I mean, there's already some tests. Uh we do a lot of driver out stuff. Uh but we still have the safety drivers sitting in the chair. Um so, uh it's not that far off.</p>
</details>

关于新的竞争对手进入自动驾驶领域，Karin认为这是一个机遇。一方面，戴姆勒卡车在硬件开发方面具有竞争优势，拥有良好的冗余底盘。他们可以与**Aurora**、**Kodiak**等新竞争对手合作。另一方面，通过**Torque**，他们也与这些公司竞争。但她相信，戴姆勒卡车与Torque的紧密合作是一个优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. When will the uh what about the new competitors coming into that area? Yeah, I mean I think we see the opportunity because on the one side you have the hardware and and we're going to develop that and and that's also going to be a competitive advantage if you have a good redundant chassis and there we believe we are super well positioned. So we could work with new competitors like Aurora or Kodiak or or or other players but then of course with Torque we compete with them. uh but we believe that because we have that close because we're working closely with Daimler and torque that's an advantage for us um which should help us.</p>
</details>

另一个重要议题是“脱碳”困境，即如何实现零排放。Karin表示，戴姆勒卡车已经开发了电动卡车，几乎可以在所有应用场景中提供电动卡车。然而，在美国，环保法规有所放松，她认为这将显著减缓电动卡车的发展，可能要到2030年以后才能再次加速。而在欧洲，法规非常严格，推动了电动化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another thing is of course the decarbonization uh uh kind of dilemma you just how are you going to get to zero emission. Yeah, it's a good question. So um we have developed electric trucks. So we basically can offer electric trucks in almost all use cases. Um in the US we see environmental legislation kind of rolled back. So we believe it will just slow down significantly now. Um and it will probably take to beyond 2030 before we see it picking up again. Uh while in Europe we have very tough legislation that pushes um electrification.</p>
</details>

她指出，客户从柴油车转向电动车需要满足三个条件，这就像一个方程式。首先是卡车本身，戴姆勒卡车和竞争对手都已提供。其次是**TCO**（Total Cost of Ownership: 总拥有成本）需要有竞争力。在某些使用场景下，尤其是在长途驾驶时，TCO已经开始具备竞争力。电动卡车的购买成本总是高于柴油车，但运行成本较低。例如，德国的道路通行费系统对电动卡车有优势，每公里可节省约30欧分，使得运营成本具有可比性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the challenge there is that for our customer to um transition from diesel to electric there needs to be three things in place and we usually say it's like an equation. So you need to have the truck uh and that's obviously we have one available so do our competitors um you need to have uh TCO so cost of operations needs to be competitive um and there it starts to get there I would say in some use cases especially um if you drive longer distances because the truck is always going to be more expensive to buy electric than a diesel but then the running cost is lower and we also see like in Germany we have the road taller system the mount which has an advantage for electric trucks which is around 30 cents per kilometer so it's like the cost of operation starts to be comparable</p>
</details>

第三部分是充电基础设施，无论是在车库还是沿途充电。Karin认为这是最难解决的挑战。她强调，如果方程式中的任何一部分为零，结果就是零。因此，他们真正需要看到更多倡议和更快速度的是在基础设施方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then the third part of the equation is the infrastructure to be able to charge um in the depo or along the route and I believe that's the most difficult challenge to solve Um and then maybe coming back to where we started as you know if you have an equation and one part is zero nothing happens. So where we really need to see more initiatives and and more speed is on the infrastructure side. Um</p>
</details>

面对欧洲全速前进而美国踩刹车的局面，Karin表示，他们曾计划将电池平台等项目作为全球项目，但现在正在考虑是否能更多地与合作伙伴合作，或者延长购买原本计划自行开发的产品的时间，以降低风险。他们会逐步审视，并考虑低销量和高销量两种情景。例如，在将电动卡车整合到生产线时，他们将其与柴油卡车在同一条生产线上生产，这样就可以根据需求发展灵活地平衡产能。

<details>
<summary>View/Typical English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how do you cope with this situation where Europe is uh you know full speed ahead and the US is kind of pressing on the on the brake you know. Yeah. Well, there were some projects that we planned uh to have as global projects like battery platforms and stuff where uh we are now looking like can we do more with partners, can we derisk to buy for a longer time things that we were planning to develop ourselves. Um so I think that's kind of stepwise looking at because there's also in Europe uncertainty how quickly it's going to scale and like in everything we do we try to think of the low volume scenario and the high volume scenario. So, as an example, when we were integrating the electric trucks into the production line, we do it on the same line as where we're producing the diesel. And that way, we can really balance depending on how the demand develops.</p>

关于氢能，Karin坚信，如果欧洲认真对待脱碳，氢能是必不可少的。她指出，今年迄今为止，欧洲注册的卡车中只有约3%是电动卡车，客户在基础设施方面已经面临电网挑战和绿色电力不足等问题。从长远来看，欧洲不可能有600万辆卡车全部依靠电力运行，这就是氢能发挥作用的地方。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What are you uh what are your thoughts on hydrogen? Uh well, we really believe hydrogen is necessary if Europe is serious about decarbonization. um because we see already today when I think this year to date around 3% of trucks registered were electric and all the struggles our customers already have on the infrastructure side to get electrified because of grid challenges because of not enough green electricity in Europe. Um so if you look in a longer perspective there is no way you're going to have six million trucks in Europe all running electric. And that's where hydrogen plays a role.</p>
</details>

有人认为氢能效率低于柴油，因此没有意义，Karin认为这回答了一个错误的问题。欧洲将需要进口能源，而氢分子是很好的进口方式。在这种情况下，在卡车中使用氢能是一种相当高效的流程。此外，当扩大规模时，建设氢能基础设施比单独扩大电力基础设施的成本更低。因此，未来将需要氢能。戴姆勒卡车正在同时开发电动和氢能技术。Karin强调，如果认真对待脱碳，仅靠一种技术是行不通的，两者都需要。

<p class="english-text">Some people say that hydrogen won't like it doesn't make sense because it's less efficient than diesel, which is true in a sense, but I believe it's an answer to the wrong question because Europe is going to need to import energy and a good way to do that will be as a hydrogen molecule. Um, and then you might as well use it in a truck and that's a pretty efficient flow. And actually also building hydrogen infrastructure when you scale it is less expensive than to try to scale electric infrastructure only. So there will be a point where we will need hydrogen. So you are developing both. We are developing both. Yeah. If you were to put your money on one of them. Well, electric is more here and now and hydrogen is still some years off. But if we're serious about decarbonization, it won't work with just one. We need both.</p>
</details>

谈到中国在卡车电动化方面的进展，**CATL**（宁德时代）曾表示，预计到2028年，50%的新卡车将是电动车。Karin对此表示，这与欧洲为实现二氧化碳目标所需达到的水平相差不远。她认为欧洲需要加快速度，采取更多措施建设基础设施。她还指出，欧洲在这个领域仍处于领先地位，全球四大卡车公司中有三家是欧洲公司，并且他们在技术上领先。因此，仍有时间，但需要更快行动。这不仅是公司的问题，也关乎立法和基础设施。她认为，欧洲花费了太多精力和金钱去遵守一些“愚蠢的法规”，而不是投资于创新和保持领先。

<details>

<p class="english-text">When you look at China and the electrification we are seeing in the trucks business, I mean CL was just out and said that by 2028 they expect 50% of the the new trucks to be electric. Um, what are your when you see that kind of statement, what are your reflections? Well, I think it's not so far off where we need to be in Europe if we're going to deliver on the CO2 targets. So, my reflection is we need to speed up. We need in Europe more initiatives to build the infrastructure. Um, and I also think we have a unique opportunity in Europe because we are still leader in this space. You know, if you look at the big global companies in the trucking space, three out of the four big ones are European and we're leading in technology. So, I think there's still time, but uh we need to start moving faster. And it's not just about the companies, it's also about legisl legislation, infrastructure. I think we spend way too much effort and money just to fulfill let's say sometimes I say stupid regulations that we have in Europe instead of investing into innovation and and really moving to stay ahead</p>
</details>

她举例说，戴姆勒卡车目前正在投资**Euro 7**（欧洲7号排放标准），这是下一代柴油排放法规。然而，Euro 6和Euro 7之间的差异很小。如果能将这数亿欧元投资于电动基础设施，对欧洲、公司和客户来说都会更好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and to give you an example we're also right now investing in Euro7 which is the next level diesel uh regulation it would be much better it's a small difference between Euro in Euro7 to start with. So the current diesel standard and the coming one. So if we could have invested those couple of hundred millions into electric infrastructure, it would have been much better for Europe and for the companies and for our customers.</p>
</details>

关于电池换电站的建设速度，Karin认为这对卡车来说并不容易，因为每块电池重达一两吨。因此，她不认为换电是卡车的主要发展路径。尽管中国市场最初是这样，但现在似乎正在转向其他方向，他们也在尝试两种方式。戴姆勒卡车在日本也进行了一些小规模的电池换电试点项目，以学习技术。但她认为，至少对于重型卡车来说，换电站可能不可行。

<p class="english-text">How fast is the the buildout of um kind of battery swap stations compared to what it need to be? Uh well, it's not so easy for trucks because you know each battery weighs like one two tons. Yeah. Um, so we actually don't really think that's the path for trucks in but that but that's what they think in China, right? I think it's it started like that. I think it's moving a little bit away from that. I think they're trying both. Um, so we're obviously following that. We do some small stuff also with with battery uh swap in Japan. So some pilot projects and stuff. So learning about the technology. Um but I think it will not be feasible at least not for heavy duty trucks. Uh but let's see.</p>
</details>

谈到戴姆勒卡车在中国的发展，Karin表示他们与**福田汽车**（Foton）成立了合资企业已有12年。她坦言，他们的发展并未达到预期。他们目前正在与合作伙伴讨论如何扭转局面，如何在中国市场取得更大的成功并实现盈利。

<p class="english-text">How do you see your development in China? Well, we are in a joint venture there with with Photon. We've been for 12 years. I don't think it's a secret that we haven't quite developed as we would have liked. Um and that's something we're currently discussing with our partner like how can we turn that around? How can we be more successful? And is there a way for us as diamond truck to be also profitable in China?</p>

### 领导力、信任与个人反思

主持人希望深入探讨文化议题。Karin在加入德国公司之前，曾在**斯堪尼亚**（Scania）工作了近二十年。主持人询问她来到德国后最大的文化冲击是什么。Karin坦言，当他们打电话邀请她时，她感到非常惊讶，因为她不仅是瑞典人，还是女性，不会说德语，也不是博士，而且比大多数担任这类职位的人都年轻。她最初以为他们只是想找瑞典的首席执行官，结果却是全球职位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">K I'd love to spend a bit more time on on the cultural issues. So you spent uh nearly two decades at Scania before uh moving to Germany. What was the biggest kind of cultural surprise surprise for sweet to come to Germany? Uh well I actually I was super surprised just when they called me if I'm interested in the job because I know I was you know not just a Swede but also a woman. I didn't speak German. I'm not a doctor. I was younger than most of the other people in those kinds of jobs. So actually when they first called they thought they just wanted a CEO for Sweden and then they're like no no it's the global it's the global job.</p>
</details>

主持人问她为什么认为戴姆勒会选择她。Karin认为，他们可能希望获得外部视角，意识到需要稍微“震动”一下现有系统。她最大的惊喜是，她原以为德国公司会更僵化、更传统，甚至曾和丈夫讨论是否需要买西装。但实际上，情况并非如此，这让她感到惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why do you think they call you? Um I think they wanted to have an outside perspective. Uh they'd realized kind of somehow they needed to shake the system a little bit. Um, I think the biggest surprise was I thought it was going to be a little bit maybe more stiff and more old school. So I I was even, you know, talking to my husband like, do I need to buy suits now? And like like actually today I'm wearing a suit, but that's really unusual for me. Um, and then so I came in and it was not like that in a positive sense.</p>
</details>

另一个惊喜是，她一直将**梅赛德斯-奔驰卡车**视为强大的竞争对手。她回忆起每两年一次的**IAA**（Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung: 国际汽车展览会），斯堪尼亚的展位相对较小，而戴姆勒的展位则像一个王国，占据了整个展厅。她原以为戴姆勒的员工会有些自大，不太愿意听取其他意见。但事实证明她错了，她发现戴姆勒的员工非常好奇，她也受到了热烈欢迎，这对于她开展工作至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the other thing was obviously I knew especially MercedesBenz trucks as a competitor and I always view them as like super strong. You know, we have this uh exhibition every two years called the IAA and we would always have a little bit of an ex stand and you know, some trucks and have some coffee with customers and then you walked into like the Daimler part and they had like a whole hall. It was like a kingdom. You could walk up the stairs and you could stand and like look at the Daimler kingdom. So I thought people would be a little bit like that style, a little bit maybe overconfident and and uh not really interested in in other perspectives. But that was very wrong in a in a positive sense. So when I came in, I I found a lot of curiosity. I felt very welcome. Um, and I think that was kind of a prerequisite obviously to get in and get stuff done.</p>
</details>

主持人提到，人们普遍认为德国的组织结构层级森严。Karin表示，德国的层级确实比斯堪的纳维亚公司多得多。但她也发现，人们最终都希望看到自己工作的目的，希望成为更大背景的一部分，希望自己的工作得到认可。他们希望在办公室、工厂或车间里，所做的工作是有意义的，时间是值得的。她认为这与德国公司非常相似，尽管存在一些层级，但人们最终都希望做有意义的事情，并做出贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We tend to think that Germany is very there is a lot of hierarchy in German organizational structures. How do you how did you experience that? I think there is much more than in a Scandinavian company. But I I also have the experience like in the end um I had another cultural experience because I I worked in Sweden many years and then I moved to Kenya and I did this cultural training and they said, "Oh, now you have to be different. You cannot do this consensus and blah blah blah. You have to be more directive and you have to tell the people what to do." And then I came into this Kenyan business and I found You know, people want to see the purpose of what they do. They want to be part of a bigger context. They want to see appreciation for what they do. Um, they want to spend their time like they want to feel when they're in the office or in the factory or on the workshop floor that what they do is meaningful and that they're spending their time in a good way. Um so I think very similar to German companies it's like there is some hierarchy but in the end people want to do meaningful things they want to contribute</p>
</details>

Karin坦言，最初她对许多事情需要首席执行官层面批准感到非常惊讶。她回忆起第一次去设计中心看新驾驶室时，她觉得不错，但所有人都等着她正式批准。她当时说自己不是驾驶室设计专家，相信团队已经完成了工作，因此不会批准，因为她不是司机，也不是购买这些卡车的人，应该去问客户。她认为，类似这样的事情，她已经将很多决策权下放了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for sure there were more things coming to the CEO level I was really surprised in the beginning at like all the things I had to sign off and you know I had to one of my first meetings when I came in I was going to go look at the new cab the one we just launched now a couple months ago and I went to our design center and we're looking at it and then I said oh that's nice and then they were all looking at me waiting for something and they're like you have to approve it formally and if you do that you're going to be like the first one who's not like everyone always comes and they want to change a little thing or two and then I'm like well I'm not a design expert on cabs so I trust that you guys you know did your job and I'm not going to approve this because like I'm not a driver. I'm not buying these trucks. So, you should be asking our customers. So, I think stuff like that. Are there a lot of decisions you have pushed down in the system? I Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人提到瑞典是共识驱动的文化，而德国工会参与度很高，尤其是在董事会层面。Karin表示，她来到戴姆勒后确实需要学习这一点，最初可能犯了一些错误，因为她过于理性。她举例说，她曾提议将德国各地工厂接收和分析缺陷零件的人员集中到一个地方，以便他们可以协同工作。但她完全低估了这对当地城镇保留工作的重要性。她认为自己学到了很多，现在与工会和劳资委员会的关系非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about um like Sweden is consensus driven? Uh but in Germany, you have very high uh union participation, right, in decision-m and at board levels. How is there a difference there? Yeah, sure. Uh this is obviously something I had to learn coming into to Daimler and I I probably made some mistakes in the beginning just being super rational. So I remember there was one example where we had these people sitting in each of our spots in Germany or where we have factories receiving parts like quality defect parts and analyzing them. And I said, you know, let's just move everything to one place because then these people can work together. And I totally underestimated, you know, it it matters for these different or like the places, the towns to keep the work. Uh so that's something where I think I learned a lot and I have today a very good relation I would say with our union and works council</p>
</details>

Karin喜欢德国的一点是，在斯堪的纳维亚，与人辩论时需要小心，但在德国，你可以更直接地表达意见，即使是“针锋相对”的讨论，也不会是针对个人的。她认为，劳资委员会的成员们也只是希望公司能做到最好。尽管有时他们对如何实现目标有不同的看法，但大家都在努力，因为他们希望公司成功，希望公司在未来50年、100年都能存在。她相信他们能找到好的解决方案，而且她认为这并不像德国以外的人想象的那么复杂，只是需要确保与另一个群体保持一致并找到解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for sure. we have really tough that's something I like with Germany you know it's in Scandinavia you have to be a little bit careful how you debate with people in Germany you can more you can go headtohead uh and really say your opinion but it's not personal so I think that's something um where the where I learned a lot with the works council we have super tough discussions but with the people in diamond the truck representing that side, they also just want what's best for the company. And in the end, we have sometimes different perspective on how to get there, but we're all working because we want to be successful and we want this company to exist in the longer perspective in the 50 and 100 years from now. So, I think we we find good solutions and I don't think it's as complicated as people outside Germany tend to make it. It's just another group that you need to make sure you align with and find solutions with.</p>
</details>

主持人指出，Karin作为一位年轻的瑞典女性，在一个大型、老牌、由德国男性主导的行业中担任领导，这是一种非凡的情况。他询问Karin，在这种情况下，建立信任的关键是什么。Karin表示，她在瑞典也曾是许多不同职位上的第一位女性，所以她对此习以为常。她认为，首先是能力，要展示出你懂自己在说什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, um, if you really think about it, it's it's an extraordinary situation that, uh, here there is a young, uh, Swedish woman coming in to run uh, kind of a a big wellestablished uh, German male uh, dominated uh, industry. What um what do you think is the key to build trust with people when you get into that kind of situation? I mean for me I was also the first woman in many different roles and so on in Sweden. Um so I'm kind of used to it but I think it's to come in uh obviously competence speaks for itself. So to show that you know what you're talking about.</p>
</details>

她还提到，她担任**梅赛德斯-奔驰卡车**负责人时，业绩发展非常好，她能够展示自己能交付成果。她第一年的销售回报率从4.8%提高到8.1%，去年达到10.1%。尽管市场低迷导致略有挫折，但整体趋势是积极的。她认为这是建立信任的最佳方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I also had the benefit coming into my old role running Mercedes-Benz trucks that we had really good development. So I could show that I'm delivering. Um we we went from I think 4.8% return on sales my first year, then 8.1, then 10.1 last year. A little bit of a of a setback due to low markets, but it's really been moving in the right direction. And I think that's the best way to to build trust. Uh but then I think also</p>
</details>

此外，当从另一家公司加入时，要避免总是说“我们斯堪尼亚是这样做的”。通常，公司之所以以某种方式做事，是有其原因的。所以最好是倾听并理解原因，而不是试图复制在其他公司奏效的方法，因为人们会厌倦这种比较。Karin认为，倾听并理解事物存在的背景，能为未来的变革提供更好的平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you come in from another company to really try to avoid this is how we did it in Scania. Oh, this is how Scanya does it. Like to there is usually a reason why companies do things the way they do. So it's better to listen and to understand why and not try to copy whatever worked in another company because people get so tired I think of this is how we did it. This is the better way. So rather listen to understand the context of why things are the way they are because that gives you also a better um platform to change it in in the direction it needs to go.</p>
</details>

主持人询问Karin最重要的领导原则。Karin引用了一位前同事的描述：“严厉的爱”（Tough love）。她认为这个描述很贴切，因为她对自己要求很高，总是想把事情提升到新的水平。她可能需要在表达赞赏方面做得更好，但她总是推动团队前进。她希望以一种既能表达对员工的关心，又能促使他们成长的方式来做，鼓励他们做以前不敢做的事情，并真正对自己的决定负责。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are your most important leadership principles? someone who worked for me some years ago. She she described it quite well. Tough love, she said, and I thought that was good because I'm quite demanding. H it's maybe one of the things I still need to work on. Like I'm never really or it's not like I'm unhappy, but I always want to take it to the next level. So, we reached like a milestone. I'm already thinking about the next one and I could probably get better at showing appreciation, but I'm tough. So, always pushing forward, but hopefully I do it in a way that I also show that I care about the people and I want them to grow and I try to push them a little bit to do things they didn't dare to do, take decisions as we talked about, making them really accountable. Um, so that's the one part</p>
</details>

另一方面，她非常依赖团队，可能比其他首席执行官更甚。她有意识地投入大量时间建设团队，了解彼此。虽然不一定成为私下的挚友，但要真正理解彼此的驱动力，达到可以相互坦诚、从团队中获取力量的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I rely a lot on the team probably more than other CEOs. I spend a lot of time consciously building the team also getting to know each other maybe not we don't have to be privately you know best friends but personally really understanding the driving forces and getting to the level where you can be vulnerable with each other and kind of get power from the team. Um so that's important for me.</p>
</details>

鉴于Karin曾是瑞典国家划船队的成员，参加过世界锦标赛，主持人询问她的体育背景如何影响了她的领导原则。Karin认为，设定新目标并不断追求更高标准，这在体育中非常明显。她最初的梦想是赢得瑞典冠军，很快就实现了。然后她的大脑会重新校准，想进入国家队，参加世界杯。这种不断挑战自己的方式，是她工作的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we were to look at those two things, given that you have been on the national rowing team in Sweden for several years, yeah, and rowing in, you know, world championships and so on. The first thing about setting new goals and pushing to new standards and so on, well, I'm sorry, this is a leading question, but I'm sorry. Sorry, let me just rephrase it. Uh, how do you think your background in sports has influenced your leadership principles? if you do the first one, if you do the first one first, setting new goals that it's pretty obvious. So, I think that's that's where I learned it. And it's like that's what professional sports is all about. It's like about constantly pushing yourself to the next level. And for me, it was like I never thought I would at first my dream was to win a Swedish championships. And then I reached that very quickly. my brain is reccalibrating. I want to make the national team and then I want to row in the World Cup and stuff. So, I think that's that's just how I work. And I think it's also a prerequisite to get there.</p>
</details>

在日常工作中，这种影响更加具体。例如，划船机上的间歇训练非常“数字化”，能精确显示表现。完成一次艰苦的训练后，虽然筋疲力尽，但下周可以做得更好一点。这种一步步的进步让她感到乐趣，也让她在戴姆勒卡车的工作中看到，通过小小的改变，随着时间推移，公司正在真正向前发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and in the dayto-day it's even more concrete because it's like, you know, you do something brutal like uh the worst thing as a rower I think is intervals on the rowing machine because it's very digital. So it tells you exactly. Um, so I would do a really hard workout and by the end, you know, you're falling off the machine lying on the floor basically and you know exactly how you perform and then you go back next week and you can actually do it a little bit better. And I think that's so that's comes from there and that I think made me that's also what makes it fun. You can always step by step also in in Daimler the truck now we do small things and then when you zoom out over time you see we're really moving so that comes from the rowing I think.</p>
</details>

关于团队合作方面，Karin认为划船是一项非常好的运动，因为它既是个人运动又是团队运动，甚至比大多数其他运动更甚。在团队赛中，你需要身体和精神都处于最佳状态，因为如果船上有人没有准备好，无论你准备得多充分都没有用。作为领导者，她的工作就是让每个人都能在精神和身体上都保持最佳状态，高效工作。这比她自己多花两个小时在办公室里想点子或写笔记要重要得多。重要的是整个组织健康运作并保持高效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what about the team aspect? Yeah I mean obviously I raised actually both. It's a very good sport rowing because it's both an individual sport and a team sport I think more than most other sports because you're racing in a in a team boat. So, I raced a lot in the double, but then maybe later in the day, you're racing in the singles against each other. So, you're both competitors and teammates. And uh one thing I learned very clearly is um if you're racing in a team boat, you have to be both physically and mentally fit because it doesn't matter how well prepared I am if someone else is sitting in that boat and is not ready. And I think a lot about that also as a leader that my job is really to enable everyone else to be fit mentally and physically and to work efficiently. That's much more worth than me spending another two hours in the office, you know, making ideas or writing notes about something. It's it's much more important that the organization is healthy working and being efficient.</p>
</details>

Karin曾在一个播客中提到，她的老板在她自己看到潜力之前就发现了她的潜力，她也尝试对其他人这样做。主持人询问这样做的关键是什么。Karin认为，这可能是她的“超能力”之一。一个关键是不要过多地关注简历，她发现自己在这方面比大多数人做得少。她非常重视个人互动，并且似乎很多时候能够做到这一点。她不确定这种能力从何而来，也许是因为她曾在许多不同的地方生活过，了解了许多不同的文化和不同类型的人。她能凭直觉判断出“这个人能把事情做好”或“这个人能积极影响这个组织”。她非常依赖自己的直觉，并且更多地思考他们能完成什么，而不是他们已经做了什么。

<p class="english-text">I listened to a podcast you did, I think it was 5 years ago, and you talked about the fact that your your your boss had seen the potential in you before you saw it yourself. Yeah. And that you tried to do that with other people. What's the key to doing that? I don't know. I think it's honestly one of my superpowers. I just I mean one key is obviously not to think too much about the CV and I just realized I do that much less than most others. So I put a lot of value in this personal interaction and it seems a lot of the time I'm able to I I actually don't know where it comes from. Maybe it's you know I lived in a lot of different places and learned a lot about different cultures and different different kinds of people. So I I I just get a good feeling like this is a person who will get it done or who will influence this organization in a positive way. Um and I use my gut feeling really a lot and also thinking more about what could they get done than what are they bringing that they have done.</p>

她表示，她会有意识地倾听自己的直觉。当被问及她的直觉是否准确时，她笑着说“目前为止还不错，但总有一天可能会失灵”。

</details>

在寻求建议方面，Karin会向许多不同的人请教。她会根据话题向团队中的不同成员寻求建议。她的董事长**Joe Kaeser**（前西门子CEO）也非常出色，他擅长公共事务、资本市场和投资者关系等她经验不足的领域，以及他在西门子时期进行的大量并购。她还会向**Jim Snape**（前德国CEO，现在是**赛班斯**（Saabans）的董事长）请教，他理解斯堪的纳维亚人在德国背景下的视角。此外，她还会向**阿特拉斯·科普柯**（Atlas Copco）的其他董事会成员寻求建议。

<p class="english-text">Who who do you turn to for advice? I have a lot of different people. So definitely different people on my team depending on the topic. Um, I have a good chairman, Joe Kesser, who I think also compliments me because the stuff he's really good at is the stuff I'm not so experienced with like, uh, public affairs, um, now capital market and all the investor stuff. A lot of M&A that he did also during his time in Seammens. Um, so him I I ask for advice. I have some others. Um, actually Jim Snape is is one. He used to be this CEO in Germany and he's the chairman in in Seibans. So he understands also this perspective of a Scandinavian in the German context. So he might can ask about stuff and and then I mean I mean Atlas Copco so asking other board members there for advice. So I think I reach a lot you know for the people who don't know Atlascop it's one of the finest Swedish engineering companies and we have everyone knows Atlas scope well you know we have people across the world and we have done a podcast with uh with them um</p>

Karin也是女性领导力网络（Women's Leadership Network）的一员。她认为这很重要，因为作为第一批担任这些职位的女性之一，她认为如果自己成功并交付成果，将为其他女性打开大门。她曾是斯堪尼亚巴士业务的第一位女性负责人，在她之后，该职位一直由女性担任。她还提到，几年前参加了一个名为“Women for Leaders”的女性培训，让她真正意识到需要做自己。这让她认识到自己领导力和思维方式的优势，而不是总是试图模仿其他同事。

<p class="english-text">now you are also uh part of women's leadership network y why is that important or is that important yeah it's important I mean first of all I think it's also being kind of one of the first women not just in this job but but in a couple of jobs. I I see it as part of my role and I sometimes think in a positive way like if I succeed and I deliver it will open the door for other women. Um because yeah and I see it I mean I was for instance the first woman to run the bus business in Scania and after me only women. So I think it just opens people's minds. But I also I did a really good training with only women a couple of years ago called women for leaders. And first I was super skeptical because I never did stuff with women and I wasn't even used, you know, I never really worked a lot with women. But it was probably there that I realized truly that I need to be myself. And it's this kind of, you know, leadership advice you get from, oh, just be yourself. Don't try to be somewhere someone else. So, it's it's not like that was new. But I think that's easier said than done. And I think during that process is when I realized the strength of being who I am. And it gave me I think also some kind of context where I was more a norm and realizing also the strength of my leadership and my way of thinking and leading instead of having that but always still trying to do all the other stuff that I saw different colleagues do.</p>

主持人指出，Karin多次提到性别议题。他问道，作为一家大公司的高层女性，有哪些优势。Karin表示她不知道，因为她不知道如果自己是男性会是怎样。她经常被问到这个问题。她认为，也许作为女性，她更容易不觉得自己必须知道一切，不必成为“超级英雄”。她发现很多男性首席执行官，可能不是德国特有的现象，会觉得必须拥有所有答案。而对她来说，承认自己不知道，并真正倾听专家的意见，比如驾驶室设计那个例子，这很容易。主持人补充说，承认自己不知道也需要很大的自信。

<p class="english-text">So on the podcast I normally never talk about uh gender uh when I speak to leaders but you you mentioned it several times. So, just as a followup, what do you think are the advantages of being a woman at the top of a big company? Uh, I have no idea. I I mean, I'm I don't know what it would be like if I was a man. I get this question actually quite often and I I bet you do, but you normally wouldn't get it from me, but just since you since you mentioned it, I mean, what are the person Do you think there are some gender uh particular gender qualities? It's it's hard to answer without generalizing. Yeah. But what I I think I'm maybe it's easier for me not to feel like I have to know everything and be like a superhero. Um I found a lot of male CEOs. I don't know if it's a German thing. I don't think so, but like feeling like you have to have all the answers. I for me it's pretty easy to admit I don't and to really truly listen to what experts think like this example with the design of the cap. Sure. You know for me was but it also takes a lot of confidence to admit that you don't know something right. Yeah maybe</p>

Karin也经常赞扬她的同事。她认为这非常重要，因为除了发现人才并推动他们超越自我之外，真正让公司成功的是人。因此，当他们取得成就时，给予他们赞扬是非常有意义的。她可能不是一个追求名声或在职业生涯结束后留下大名的人，这可能有所帮助。这无关乎她个人，而是关乎公司、公司里的人，以及为公司和客户建设一个美好的未来。

<p class="english-text">you talk up your colleagues a lot. I do that too. I think it's very very important. I think they all deserve it but um not everybody does. What what are your reflections about that? I think it's comes very natural because the key apart from you know finding the talent and pushing people to to go beyond what they thought was possible. That's what makes a company successful is the people. Um, so it makes a lot of sense to give them credit when we accomplish something. I also think I'm not maybe a person I don't strive for, you know, being famous or having a big, I don't know, being a name after I finish my career. So maybe that helps. It's not about me. It's about the company and the people in the company and building a good future for the company and of course for the customers and so on. I I've never reflected on it actually.</p>

### 个人充电站与对年轻人的建议

主持人询问Karin的“个人充电站”是什么。Karin回答说是“山”。她透露自己正在度假，刚从山上回来。她很喜欢住在德国南部，离阿尔卑斯山只有两小时车程，几乎每个周末都会去。

<p class="english-text">Now we talked about uh we talked about the batteries and infrastructure. What is your personal charging station? The mountains I would say. So um I told you I'm actually on holiday right now. I just came from the mountains. So absolutely. Uh, but also I mean that's one of the things I love about living in South Germany. So we are two hours from the Alps. I go there almost every weekend. Um,</p>
</details>

对她来说，这首先是家庭时间。其次，在山里，她会进行体育锻炼，例如越野跑，冬天则滑雪。这让她在身体上得到锻炼，同时身处大自然中，让她不再思考工作。她认为，这实际上也是从划船中学到的一个经验：表现与恢复之间的平衡。这在首席执行官的生活中同样重要，很多人低估了恢复的重要性，但实际上，恢复和充电与在工作中表现同样重要。

<p class="english-text">why is that important for you? First of all, it's family time. Um, second of all, being in the mountains. I mean, I I do sports. So now I'm doing a lot of trail running in the winter, crosscountry skiing or or touring. that both makes me recharged because I get to move physically um and also just being in nature. I think there is something special about that makes you not think about work and I believe that actually that's also one of the learnings from rowing is this balance between performance and recovery like that's the same in CEO life and I think a lot of people underestimate the recovery part. But actually that's probably as important as delivering and being on when you're on the job is recovering and recharging when you're off the job.</p>

主持人认为，首席执行官（CEO）也代表“首席能源官”（Chief Energy Officer），因此也需要充电才能交付成果。Karin每周都有自我反思的习惯。她会在周五晚上或周六早上坐下来，写下本周发生的事情、感受和学到的东西。她还会与一位曾一起参加培训的朋友**Charlotte**分享这些内容。她认为这是一种很好的方式，既能了解本周的进展和学习，也能放下工作，以好心情进入周末。

<p class="english-text">I think CEO stands for chief energy officer and so you also need you also need to charge to be able to deliver that. Um now I believe that you have a weekly ritual of self-reflection. Yes. How does that work? Um so every either it's Friday night or Saturday morning I sit down and I write uh what happened uh what did I feel what did I learn and I share that actually with someone who I did this training with Shalot um and we've been doing that for years and I think it's a good way both to really be aware of like what happened during the week did I accomplished what I what I planned also what did I learn? Um and it's also a way to let go of the week to get into the weekend in a good mood. Um and I yeah it works for me very well.</p>
</details>

她会保留这些笔记，有时会回头阅读，但并不频繁。她知道另一个人也这样做，那就是**Lonza**公司的**Albert Benny**，他甚至把这些反思整理成一本书送给了女儿。Karin表示，也许将来她也会为自己的儿子们这样做。

<p class="english-text">What do you do with the notes? I keep them and I don't know sometimes I go back and read but not very much. So I have like some big books at home with reflections. I know one other person who does this and this is Albert Benny. Okay. At Gabberit and Lonza and he's made it into a book which he has given to his daughter. Oh yeah. So perhaps that could be something for you. For my sons, maybe they will be interested one day.</p>

最后，Karin对年轻人的建议是：相信自己。她认为自己过去也需要听到这个建议，她没有意识到自己可以在世界上有所作为。无论是申请第一份工作还是刚开始工作时，她都缺乏自信，不相信自己能做出贡献。她认为，年轻人的这种能量和清晰的洞察力是商业界所需要的。所以，要相信自己，大胆发声，勇往直前，真正敢于梦想。一切皆有可能，通常是自己的思想限制了自己。不要给自己设限，要敢于想大。

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. What is your advice to young people? I think one advice I would have needed to hear myself is to just believe in yourself. Um I don't think I realized that I could make a difference in the world. So also coming in both applying for my first jobs and coming into my first jobs, I didn't have the self-confidence to believe I could contribute. So even when maybe this gut feeling was telling me things, I was holding it back. But I think that's this energy and the clearsightedness of young people we need in business. So believe in yourself, speak up, go for it and and really dream big. Anything is possible. Usually it's you know yourself stopping your mind. Don't make those limits. Just think big.</p>

主持人称赞Karin是播客中遇到过的最令人印象深刻的嘉宾之一，非常真诚，并表示完全理解她为何被认为是瑞典最重要的女性首席执行官。他感谢Karin的分享。
