### 开场

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自 **《纽约时报》**，这是头条新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 19 日，星期四。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, February 19th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

### 美伊紧张局势升级

**Tracy Mumford**: 《纽约时报》获悉，**特朗普政府**在中东迅速增兵，已达到**特朗普总统**可能在本周末就打击**伊朗**的程度。他并未给出任何将采取行动的迹象，但他曾反复威胁，如果伊朗不结束其核计划，就将采取行动。这可能重演 **June**（6月）美国与 **以色列** 联合打击伊朗军事和核设施的事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Times has learned that the Trump administration's rapid buildup of US forces in the Middle East has reached the point that President Trump has the option to strike Iran as soon as this weekend. He's given no indication that he will, but he's repeatedly threatened action if Iran doesn't end its nuclear program. That could be a repeat of June when the US joined with Israel to strike Iranian military and nuclear facilities.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 您能否谈谈总统关于是否打击伊朗的想法，他正在与谁沟通，以及为什么对一个他声称已被上次美国打击摧毁的核计划进行打击可能是必要的？嗯，有很多理由和论据可以支持打击伊朗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Can you share a little bit about the president's thinking on whether or not to strike Iran, who he's talking to, and why a strike might be necessary on a nuclear program he says was obliterated by the last US strike. Well, there's many reasons and arguments that one could make uh for a strike against Iran.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 尽管特朗普政府一再表示 6 月份的打击摧毁了伊朗的核计划，但专家表示，破坏并不彻底，该国一直在重建。本周，美国与伊朗官员进行了会谈。昨天，白宫新闻秘书 **Caroline Levitt** 表示，特朗普的首选仍然是外交解决方案。虽然对于伊朗或世界上任何国家，外交始终是他的首选，而伊朗与特朗普总统及本届政府达成协议将是非常明智的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: while the Trump administration has repeatedly said the June strikes destroyed Iran's nuclear program, experts say the damage was not complete and the country's been rebuilding. There were talks this week between the US and Iranian officials. And yesterday, White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said Trump's preference is still a diplomatic resolution. Though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option and Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with this administration.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 随着谈判的继续，该地区正处于高度戒备状态。以色列军队一直在为与美国可能进行的又一次联合打击做准备，而美国在中东的火力也在不断增强。现在那里有 13 艘海军驱逐舰，数十架攻击机，以及一艘航空母舰正在赶来。**五角大楼**还派遣了更多的防空系统，以帮助保护该地区约 30,000 至 40,000 名美军。特朗普在竞选连任时承诺让美国远离战争，但任何对伊朗的打击，如果发生，将是过去一年中美国对其他国家进行的至少第七次军事袭击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: As the negotiations continue, the region is going on high alert. Israeli forces have been making preparations for another potential joint strike with the US and America's firepower in the Middle East keeps growing. There are now 13 Navy destroyers there, dozens of attack aircraft, and a second aircraft carrier is on the way. The Pentagon has also dispatched more air defense systems to help protect the roughly 30 to 40,000 US troops in the region. While Trump campaigned for his second term in office, promising to keep the US out of wars, any strike on Iran, if it were to happen, would be at least the seventh American military attack on another country in the past year.

### 五角大楼AI之争

**Tracy Mumford**: 在五角大楼内部，**国防部**与该国最大的 AI 公司之一 **Anthropic** 之间发生了一场不同寻常的争斗。其核心是如何以及是否应该由军队使用人工智能。国防部与许多科技巨头合作，包括 **Anthropic**、**Google**、**OpenAI** 以及 **Elon Musk** 的 **XAI**。上个月，国防部长 **Pete Hegsth** 发布了一份备忘录，呼吁这些公司解除对其 AI 技术的限制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Inside the Pentagon, there's been an unusual fight taking place between the Defense Department and Anthropic, one of the country's biggest AI companies. At the heart of it is the question of how AI should or should not be used by the military. The DoD works with a lot of tech giants, Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's XAI. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegsth put out a memo calling on those companies to remove restrictions on their AI technology.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **Anthropic** 表示“等等”。据参与讨论的两人称，该公司告诉国防官员，它不希望其 AI 被用于大规模监控美国人，也不希望被部署在可能在无人干预下开火的自主武器中。它希望重新谈判合同。据现任和前任官员称，这激怒了 Hegsth 和五角大楼的其他官员。本周，当 Axios 报道五角大楼即将宣布 **Anthropic** 为“**供应链风险**”时，这场争斗公之于众。这是一个罕见的指定，将切断该公司与美国军方的联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Anthropic said, "Hold on." According to two people involved in the discussions, the company told defense officials it does not want its AI used for mass surveillance of Americans or to be deployed in autonomous weapons that could fire with no humans involved. It wanted to renegotiate its contract. That angered Hegsth and others in the Pentagon, according to current and former officials. This week, the fight broke into the open when Axios reported the Pentagon was close to declaring anthropic, quote, a supply chain risk, a rare designation that would sever ties between the company and the US military.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 如果发生，这将是一个重大的断裂。**Anthropic** 的技术已广泛集成到国防部的各个部门，包括机密系统。**《华尔街日报》**报道称，该公司技术曾被用于美国在委内瑞拉抓捕 **Nicholas Maduro** 的行动。五角大楼发言人表示，该部门与 **Anthropic** 的关系正在审查中，并引用道：“我们的国家要求我们的伙伴愿意帮助我们的战士赢得任何战斗。” **Anthropic** 则表示，它正在与政府进行真诚的对话，以“正确处理这些复杂问题”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: If it happens, it will be a significant break. Anthropic tech is widely integrated across the DoD, including in classified systems. The Wall Street Journal reported the company's tech was used in the US operation in Venezuela to capture Nicholas Maduro. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesman said the department's relationship with Anthropic was being reviewed and quote, "Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our war fighters win in any fight." Anthropic, for its part, said it was having goodfaith conversations with the government on how to quote get these complex issues right.

### 英国王子被捕

**Tracy Mumford**: 据 **BBC** 报道，英国警方已逮捕了 **Andrew Mountbatton Windsor**（即前**王子安德鲁**），因怀疑他曾与 **Jeffrey Epstein** 共享机密信息。警方声明并未点名被捕嫌疑人，这在英国法律下是常态，但细节与公众所知的针对他的指控相符。安德鲁与爱泼斯坦的联系多年来一直有据可查。**Virginia**，爱泼斯坦的受害者之一，曾表示她十几岁时被贩卖给安德鲁，并曾多次与他发生性关系，安德鲁否认了这一指控。最近，安德鲁因其行为面临越来越多的后果，包括被剥夺王室头衔。然而，此次调查开启了新篇章。在司法部发布的与爱泼斯坦调查相关的最新一批文件中，有多封电子邮件显示安德鲁在担任英国贸易使节期间可能共享了机密文件。本月早些时候的一份声明中，**白金汉宫**表示，**国王查尔斯**，安德鲁的兄弟，已明确表示他“对不断浮出水面的指控深感关切”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: According to the BBC, police in Britain have arrested Andrew Mountbatton Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, over suspicions that he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein. A police statement did not name the suspect they'd arrested, as is normal under British law, but the details match what's publicly known about the allegations against him. Andrew's connections to Epstein have been well documented for years. Virginia, one of Epste's victims, has said she was trafficked to Andrew when she was a teenager and that he had sex with her multiple times, an allegation he's denied. Recently, Andrew has faced a growing number of consequences for his conduct, including being stripped of his royal titles. This investigation though opens a new chapter. In the most recent trunch of documents released by the Justice Department related to its Epstein investigation, there were a number of emails that suggested Andrew may have shared confidential documents when he was working as a British trade envoy. In a statement from earlier this month, Buckingham Palace has said that King Charles, Andrew's brother, has been clear about his quote, profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light.

### 韩国前总统判刑

**Tracy Mumford**: 一年多前，在韩国，该国总统 **Yunukul** 震惊了全国乃至世界，他通过电视宣布戒严，声称其政治对手是“反国家势力”。当晚，尹（Yun）禁止了所有政治活动，并将新闻媒体置于军事控制之下。军用直升机降落在国会大厦，军队正准备接管立法机构。几乎立即，韩国民众冲向大楼与军队对峙，为议员们争取时间投票否决了总统的戒严令。尹（Yun）最终被弹劾并被指控领导叛乱。今天早上，他被判有罪并判处终身监禁。检察官曾寻求判处死刑。在判决中，负责此案的法官表示，尹（Yun）的行为构成了一场骚乱，对韩国社会造成了深远损害，并加剧了政治两极分化。过去一年，数千名尹（Yun）的支持者举行了频繁的集会，并构成了一个新的极右翼政治运动的核心。他们宣扬一种阴谋论，声称韩国选举被外国人操纵，并以美国国旗作为他们事业的象征，口号是“让韩国再次伟大”。尹（Yun）有 **一周** 时间对裁决提出上诉，他是自韩国 20 世纪 80 年代从威权统治转变为民主国家以来，第五位面临刑事指控的韩国总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In South Korea just over a year ago, the country's president Yunukul stunned the nation and the world by going on TV to declare martial law, claiming his political opponents were anti-state forces. That night, Yun banned all political activities and placed the news media under military control. Military helicopters landed at the National Assembly with troops moving to take over the legislature. Almost immediately, South Koreans rushed to the building to confront the troops, buying lawmakers time to vote down the president's martial law decree. Yun was eventually impeached and charged with leading an insurrection. This morning, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors had been pushing for the death penalty. In his verdict, the judge overseeing the case said what Yun did amounted to a riot that caused profound damage to South Korean society and supercharged political polarization. Over the last year, thousands of Yun supporters have held frequent rallies and formed the core of a new far-right political movement in the country. They promote a conspiracy theory claiming that South Korean elections have been manipulated by foreigners and they've used the American flag as a symbol for their cause along with the slogan make Korea great again. Yun, who has one week to appeal the ruling, is the fifth South Korean president to face criminal charges since the country transitioned from authoritarian rule to a democracy in the 1980s.

### 加州雪崩灾难

**Tracy Mumford**: 极端天气条件，我想说这是一种轻描淡写。大量的降雪，狂风，能见度极低。因此，昨天 **加利福尼亚州** 官员提供了关于美国近 50 年来最致命雪崩灾难的新细节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Extreme weather conditions I would I would say is an understatement. Uh lots of snow, gale force winds making it impossible to see. So it was officials in California yesterday provided new details about what's become the deadliest avalanche disaster in the US in almost 50 years.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他们正从野外返回，回到营地时发生了雪崩。**内华达县**的警长描述了这群由导游陪同的滑雪者，在结束为期 3 天的行程时，被雪崩吞没。八名滑雪者遇难，一名队员仍下落不明，推定已死亡。由于危险条件，遗体尚未从现场运下。执法部门还描述了许多 **iPhone** 上的 **Emergency SOS** 功能如何在灾难发生后帮助幸存的滑雪者与急救人员沟通，以便他们获救。手机上的紧急 SOS 功能允许用户向紧急服务发送短信，即使他们没有蜂窝网络服务或 Wi-Fi。它使用的是卫星连接。**Apple** 表示，在紧急情况下获得最佳连接，用户应在户外，视野开阔，能清楚看到天空和地平线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Day that they were coming out of the the back country, coming back to the trail head when the avalanche occurred. The sheriff of Nevada County described how the group of skiers accompanied by tour guides was just finishing up their 3-day trip when they were hit by a wall of snow. Eight skiers were killed and one member of the group remains missing, presumed dead. Because of the hazardous conditions, the bodies have not been brought down from the site yet. Law enforcement also described how a feature available on many iPhones helped the surviving skiers communicate with first responders after the disaster so they could be rescued. The emergency SOS feature on the phones allows users to text emergency services even if they don't have cell service or Wi-Fi. It uses a satellite connection instead. Apple says that to get the best connection in an emergency, the user should be outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon.

### 俄罗斯体育解禁

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，**俄罗斯**长期以来的体育禁赛即将结束。**2026 年残奥会**的组织者已确认，**俄罗斯**将派出一小队运动员参赛。这是自 2014 年以来，俄罗斯国旗和国歌首次出现在该赛事中。俄罗斯的全球体育禁赛始于对其国家支持的兴奋剂计划的揭露。随后，在 2022 年该国入侵乌克兰后，禁赛加剧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, Russia's longstanding sports exile is coming to an end. The organizers of the 2026 Parolympic Games, which start in Italy next month after the Olympics wrap up, have confirmed that Russia will be represented by a small team of athletes. It will be the first time that the Russian flag and anthem will appear at the game since 2014. Russia's global sports banishment started as a response to revelations about the country's sprawling state sanctioned doping scheme. It then deepened after the country invaded Ukraine in 2022.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周的这一转变立即遭到乌克兰及其欧洲盟友的愤怒和批评。欧盟委员会体育事务代表表示将抵制残奥会开幕式以示抗议，乌克兰也表示其官员不会参加任何赛事。尽管如此，一些全球体育领袖对俄罗斯参赛的态度有所软化。国际足联（**FIFA**）主席表示，他希望看到俄罗斯重返国际足球比赛。国际奥委会（**IOC**）主席本月表示，体育必须是“一个与政治分离的中立场所”，这可能为俄罗斯参加 2028 年洛杉矶奥运会铺平道路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This week's reversal was immediately met with anger and criticism from Ukraine and its European allies. The European Commission's representative for sports said he would boycott the Parolympics opening ceremony in protest and Ukraine said its officials wouldn't attend any of the events. Still, attitudes toward Russia's participation have been softening among some global sports leaders. The president of FIFA has said he would like to see Russia return to soccer's international competitions. And the head of the International Olympic Committee said this month that sports must be a quote neutral ground separate from politics, potentially paving the way for Russia to compete at the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
