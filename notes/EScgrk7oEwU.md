### 技术成瘾与大脑重塑

**旁白**: 通过沉迷于社交媒体、大量快速视频，你正在积极地以最糟糕的方式重塑你的大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**旁白**: You are actively rewiring your brain for the worst by engaging with social media, high volume, quick videos.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 社交媒体高管不让他们的孩子使用这些东西，因为他们设计它就是为了让人上瘾。他们知道数百万儿童曾遭受网络欺凌、性侵。许多人甚至自杀。所以我很生气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: And the social media executives don't let their kids use this stuff because they designed it to be addictive and they know that millions and millions of kids have been cyberbullied, sexed. Many have committed suicide. So, I'm getting angry.

</details>

**Adi**: 从医学角度看，它正在重塑你的身体，增加你患心脏病和创伤后应激障碍（**PTSD**）的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: And then from the medical perspective, it's rewiring your body, increasing your risk of heart disease and PTSD.

</details>

**Stephen**: 我们已经过度沉浸在虚拟世界中，结果是灾难性的。人们平均每天花大约六个半小时在手机上。我们该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: We've moved too far into the virtual world and the results are catastrophic. People are spending roughly about 6 and a half hours a day on their phones. What do we do about this?

</details>

**Stephen**: 令人惊奇的是，我们实际上可以掌控自己的命运。我们邀请到一位社会心理学家和一位哈佛医生，深入探讨全球数十亿人正面临的技术成瘾和**脑损伤**危机，以及我们如何应对其毁灭性的心理健康影响。你必须重新夺回你的注意力，因为如果无法一次性集中注意力几分钟，我们就会看到人类潜能、人际关系和连接的毁灭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Well, here's the amazing thing. We actually can control our fate. So, we are joined by a social psychologist and a Harvard physician to dive into the technology addiction and brain rot crisis billions are facing worldwide and how we can counter its devastating mental health effects. You have to reclaim your attention because without the ability to pay attention for several minutes at a time, we're seeing the destruction of human potential, the human relationships, the connection.

</details>

**Adi**: 但你可以做一些小调整来克服那种原始的滑动冲动。例如，91%的人在连续使用设备但没有互联网访问两周后，注意力、幸福感和心理健康都有所改善。接下来，把手机放在手臂够不到的地方，因为纯粹的分心潜力已被证明会改变你的**前额叶皮层**，这被称为**大脑耗竭**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: But there's all these small tweaks that you can do to override that primal urge to scroll. For example, 91% of people had an improvement in attention, well-being, and mental health. After just 2 weeks of continuing to use your device, but not having internet access. Next, keep your phone out of your arms reach because the sheer potential for distraction has actually been shown to change your prefrontal cortex, which is called brain drain.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的，我们应该多加自控，但我们正被推向成瘾应用，这让我们都一团糟。这不是我们的错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So, yes, we should exert more self-control, but we're being pushed in addictive apps and it's messing us all up. That's not our fault.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你会建议人们删除这些短视频吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Would you advise people to delete these short form videos?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 天哪，是的，那将是你为你的智力和人类所能做的最重要的事情。但如果我要提供一些具体建议，这里有三件事是我和我的学生一起做的，以重新获得注意力。然后，在此基础上，我还有一个三秒钟的大脑重置。所以，首先...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Oh my god, yes, that would the most important thing you can do for your intelligence and for humanity. But if I was going to offer some specific advice, here are the three things that I do with my students to reclaim retention. And then to add to that, I have the 3 second brain reset. So, first

</details>

**Stephen**: 我想问你们对这个有什么看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I wanted to ask you guys what you thought of this.

</details>

**视频片段**: 嘿，你回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: Hey, you're back.

</details>

**视频片段**: 这让我很害怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: This terrifies me.

</details>

**视频片段**: 我们现在必须阻止这一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: We've got to stop this now.

</details>

**Stephen**: 各位，我有一个小忙想请你们帮一下。我们节目的订阅量即将达到一个重要的里程碑，但大约有69%的听众喜欢这个节目却出于某种原因还没有订阅。如果有什么时候你需要帮我们一个忙，或者我们曾以任何方式为你提供过价值，那就是简单地点击那个订阅按钮。这对我自己，也对我的团队意义重大，因为当我们达到这些里程碑时，我们会作为团队一起出去庆祝。这是你可以做的简单、免费、轻松的事情，帮助我们每周都把这个节目做得更好一点。所以，这是我请求你的一个帮助。如果你点击了订阅按钮，我不会让你失望的。我们会继续寻找小方法来让整个制作变得更好。非常感谢你参与这段旅程。这对我来说意味着全世界。是的，我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Guys, I've got a quick favor to ask you. We're approaching a significant subscriber milestone on this show, and roughly 69% of you that listen and love this show haven't yet subscribed for whatever reason. If there was ever a time for you to do us a favor, if we've ever done anything for you, given you value in any way, it is simply hitting that subscribe button. And it means so much to myself, but also to my team, cuz when we hit these milestones, we go away as a team and celebrate. And it's the thing, the simple, free, easy thing you can do to help make this show a little bit better every single week. So, that's a favor I would ask you. And, um, if you do hit the subscribe button, I won't let you down. And we'll continue to find small ways to make this whole production better. Thank you so much for being part of this journey. Means the world. And uh yeah, let's do this.

### 短视频对注意力的腐蚀

**Stephen**: **Jonathan**，我听你说过，注意力的破坏是全球人类面临的最大威胁。我也听你说过，短视频是其中最糟糕的，因为它们正在粉碎人们的注意力广度。我今天想进行这次对话，有点私人原因。事实上，我在节目中进行的所有对话在某种程度上都有点私人性质。它们受到我脑海中一些未解问题以及我生活中一些观察的启发。我的观察是，短视频尤其让我的生活变得更糟。实际上，我必须说，真正促使我想到“我需要把你们这些杰出的人聚在一起进行这次对话”的催化剂时刻是，我当时想，我查看了我的屏幕使用时间，看到了巨大的变化，我感觉糟糕多了，因为所有这些社交平台现在都有短视频。然后我真的听到**埃隆·马斯克**（他有一个做短视频的社交媒体平台）说，他认为这是人类最糟糕的发明之一。**Jonathan**，你为什么会说短视频和这种注意力腐蚀？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Jonathan, I've heard you say that the destruction of attention is the largest threat to humanity that's happening around the world. And I've also heard you say that short form videos are the worst of the worst because they're shattering attention spans. The reason why I wanted to have this conversation today is somewhat personal. And in fact, all of the conversations have in the driver are somewhat personal to some degree. um they're inspired by some unanswered question I have in my head and also some observation I have in my life and the observation I've had is that short form videos in particular are making my life worse and actually I've got to say the catalyst moment really where I thought you know I need to get you exceptional people together to have this conversation was I thought this I then looked at my screen time and saw a huge change I felt so much worse because all these social platforms have short form video now and then I actually heard Elon Musk who you know has a social media platform that does short form video say that he thinks it's one of the worst inventions for humanity.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的，因为我写了一整本书叫《**焦虑的一代**》，专注于青少年心理健康。这是2000年代中期出现的一个谜团：为什么1995年以后出生的人如此焦虑和抑郁？我一直在追查这个谜团，很多证据都指向社交媒体，尤其是**Instagram**、社会比较，以及我们所了解的关于社交媒体的一切。当这本书在2024年出版时，我意识到我大大低估了其危害，因为我当时只关注了心理健康，那已经是一场灾难。但更大的危害是人类注意力能力的破坏。如果无法一次性集中注意力几分钟，理想情况下是10到20分钟，没有这种能力，你作为一名员工就没什么用处，作为配偶也没什么用处，在生活中也不会成功。那时我才意识到，这远远超出了心理健康的范畴。这正在改变人类的认知，改变人类的注意力，而且可能是在全球范围内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah, because I wrote a whole book called The Anxious Generation focusing on teen mental health. That was the mystery that popped up in the mid200s. Why are people born after 1995 so much more anxious and depressed? And I've been tracking down that mystery and it points a lot of it points to social media and especially Instagram, social comparison, all the things we know about social media. When the book came out in 2024, since then what I realized is that I vastly underestimated the damage because I focused on mental health, which is a catastrophe. But the bigger damage is the destruction of the human ability to pay attention. Without the ability to pay attention for several minutes at a time, ideally 10 or 20 minutes at a time. Without that, you're not going to be of much use as an employee. You're not going to be of much use as a spouse. You're not going to be successful in life. And that's when I realized this is way beyond mental health. This is changing human cognition, changing human attention, and possibly on a global scale.

</details>

**Stephen**: **Adi**，你从什么角度看待这个问题？你通过对大脑、压力、神经科学等方面的所有工作，形成了怎样的观点，这些观点又如何塑造了你对社交媒体、屏幕时间和短视频的看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Adi, what perspective do you come at this from? And what's been your perspective through all the work you've done about brains and stress and neuroscience and all these kinds of things that has shaped the way that you think about social media, screen time, short form video.

</details>

**Adi**: 我的背景是，我是一名哈佛大学的医生，我的专长是压力、倦怠和心理健康。所以我通过这个视角来看待这一切。我们知道，你拥有的最有害的关系是与你的设备之间的关系。你知道，在每段健康的关系中，我们都有界限。我们与孩子、父母、同事、朋友都有界限。然而，在与设备的关系上，我们却没有界限，而且往往是最糟糕的界限。所以，这不仅仅是关于成为一个数字隐士，放弃技术，因为技术可以为我们服务，对吗？它能启发、教育、连接。现在比以往任何时候都更重要的是成为一个知情的公民，但不能以牺牲你的心理健康为代价。所以，**Jonathan**刚才说的，这种不断与设备、社交媒体互动，从你醒来的那一刻起直到睡觉都在滑动屏幕，这就是为什么你在洗澡时会有最好的想法，因为那是你一天中唯一不带设备的地方。人们把设备带到浴室，他们带着设备睡觉，你带着设备吃饭，人们走在街上。行人险些发生事故的情况更多了，因为人们在过马路时还在看他们的设备。所以，幕后有所有这些大脑生物学在起作用。你们两位都谈到，不断使用手机、无限滑动的感觉并不好，但它确实存在。你知道，这感觉就像你什么都没做，你只是在做这个，对吗？你在做什么？但事实上，它不是被动的，它是主动的。它对你的生物学、你的大脑、你的心理，以及我们今天希望讨论的社会因素都有深远的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: My background is that I'm a physician at Harvard and it my expertise is in stress, burnout, and mental health. And so that is the lens that I view all of this through. We know that the most delletterious relationship that you have is with your device. You know, in every healthy relationship, we have boundaries. We have boundaries with our kids, our parents, our colleagues, our, you know, wi-i with our friends. And yet, we have no boundaries and often poorest boundaries when it comes to the relationship you have with your device. So, it's not so much about, you know, becoming a digital monk and renouncing technology because technology can serve us, right? It inspires, educates, connects. Now more than ever, it's so important to be an informed citizen, but not at the expense of your mental health. And so what Jonathan was saying, this, you know, constant being engaged with your devices, with social media, the scrolling from the minute you wake up until you go to bed, there's a reason why you have your best ideas in the shower. And that's because that's the only place in the whole day where you are not with your device. People take their device to the bathroom. They sleep with your device. you eat with your device, people walk down the street. There's more near miss pedestrian accidents because people are walking while they're crossing the street and um looking at their devices. And so there's all of this brain biology at play behind the scenes. So both of you have talked about how it doesn't feel good to engage and constantly be on your phone, that sense of infinite scroll, but there is, you know, it feels like you're doing nothing. You're just doing this, right? What are you doing? But in fact, it is not passive. It is active. And it has a profound effect on your biology, on your brain, on your psychology, and also social factors that I hope we talk about today.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你知道，滑动屏幕，浪费一点时间，看起来似乎没什么害处。如果我们把时间推到10年、20年、30年后，最大的风险或威胁是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: You know, scrolling, wasting a bit of time doesn't seem so harmful. What is the big, if we play this forward 10, 20, 30 years, what is the big risk or threat?

</details>

**Adi**: 最大的威胁现在就存在，我们甚至不必等20年，那就是通过一个叫做**神经可塑性**的过程（这只是一个花哨的词，简单来说就是你的大脑是一块肌肉），通过使用社交媒体，那种大量、低质量、快速的视频，你正在积极地以更糟糕的方式重塑你的大脑。所以，你正在增加你的压力感，恶化你的心理健康、注意力、认知、易分心性、易怒性、复杂问题解决能力。当你进行这种无限滑动时，所有这些都会改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: The biggest threat right now, we don't even have to wait 20 years, is that it through a process called neuroplasticity, which is just a big fancy word that simply means that your brain is a muscle, is that by engaging with social media, that that sense of high volume, lowquality, quick videos, you are actively rewiring your brain for the worse. So you're increasing your sense of stress, worsening your mental health, attention, cognition, distractability, irritability, complex problem solving. All of that changes when you engage in engage in that infinite scroll.

</details>

### 短视频与传统媒体的区别

**Jonathan**: 是的，我想补充一点，因为我得到的主要论点之一是：“啊，他们以前对电视也是这么说的。哦，他们对漫画书也是这么说的。这不过是又一次道德恐慌。”但人们需要明白，触摸屏设备与电视有何不同。所以，我想如果我简要说明一下，父母们会觉得这很有帮助：好的屏幕时间与坏的屏幕时间。人类是会讲故事的动物。我们自有了语言以来，就一直用故事、史诗诗歌以及各种故事来抚养孩子。故事是好的。人类大脑需要大量的模式。儿童的大脑需要大量的模式来发展。所以，你能做的最糟糕的事情就是把设备递给你的孩子，因为他们哭着要，因为他们已经被训练成会要，而你又很忙。所以你把设备递给他们。他们安静了。发生了什么？他们独自坐着。不像我小时候，我们总是和姐妹、朋友一起看电视。你会争论，你会社交。现在孩子独自一人拿着设备坐着。这不是长故事。绝不是长故事。它总是以**YouTube Shorts**、**TikTok**或**Instagram Reels**（对于大一点的孩子）告终。所以，他们正在做这个。但这是它与电视不同的关键之处。电视让你进入一种心理学家称之为“**沉浸**”的状态。你沉浸在一个故事中，你会发现自己被吸引进去，你会为角色加油。这就是大脑如何适应社会模式的方式，但这不可能在10秒内发生。不可能在一分钟内发生。它需要很长一段时间，而且没有强化。电视不会对你做任何事情。你没有任何反应。而触摸屏设备是一个**斯金纳箱**。**BF·斯金纳**是行为主义的创始人之一，他把老鼠和鸽子放在一个箱子里，他可以按照时间表提供强化物，比如一小粒食物。通过对行为进行快速强化，他可以在几个小时内训练它们做出惊人的把戏。当你给孩子一个触摸屏设备时，它是刺激-反应，滑动，得到奖励或不得到奖励，变比率强化。然后你就会一直这样做。所以，正如**Adi**所说，它正在重塑你的大脑。这不仅仅是浪费时间。它实际上是在训练你做事情，而电视没有这样做。所以，这是一个全新的游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. I'd like to add on here because one of the main arguments I get is, ah, this is what they said about television. Oh, this is what they said about comic books. This is just another moral panic. But people need to understand why touchscreen devices are so different from television. And so I think parents find this helpful if I just lay this out briefly. Good screen time versus bad screen time. So humans are storytelling animals. We have always, as long as we've had language, we've raised our kids with stories, epic poems, all kinds of stories. Stories are good. Sto the human brain needs lots of patterns. The child's brain needs lots of patterns to develop. So the worst thing you can do is hand your child the device because they're crying for it because they've been they trained to get it and you're busy. So you have hand them the device. They're quiet. What's happening? They're sitting alone. Not, you know, when I was a kid, we always watch with my sisters, with my friends. You're arguing about it. You're talking at social kids sitting alone with a device in his hand. It's not long stories. It's never long stories. It always ends up at YouTube shorts or Tik Tok or Instagram reels for older kids. So, they're doing they're doing this. But here's the key thing that it does that a television does not. A television puts you in a state that psychologists call transportation. You get into a story and you find yourself pulled in and you're rooting for the characters and this is this is how a brain gets tuned up to social patterns but it can't happen in 10 seconds. It can't happen in one minute. It takes a long period of time and there is no reinforcement. There is no the television doesn't do anything to you. You don't have any response. Whereas a touchscreen device is a Skinner box. So BF Skinner was one of the founders of behaviorism and he put rats and pigeons in a box where he could deliver a reinforcement, a little grain of food on a schedule. And by giving them quick reinforcements for behavior, he could train them to do amazing tricks in just a few hours. When you give your kid a touchscreen device, it's stimulus response, swipe, get a reward or not, variable ratio. And then and and you just keep doing that. So you are, as Adi said, it is rewiring your brain. It's not just wasting time. It is literally training you to do things where television didn't do that. So this is a whole new game.

### 睡眠、创伤后应激障碍与大脑生物学

**Adi**: 补充一点，你知道，从医学角度看，你正在缩短注意力广度。随着时间的推移会发生什么呢？就像**Jonathan**说的，对吧，你睡不好，因为你沉迷于你的设备。我们知道80%的人在醒来几分钟内就会查看手机。我们有一种叫做“**报复性睡前拖延症**”的东西。这个概念是，你知道，一天结束时你很疲惫，度过了漫长的一天，没有自己的时间，你想要早点睡觉。顺便说一下，我们都知道数据是什么，我们从小就被教导，对吧？比如睡觉时间，睡眠很重要，它对你的身体有好处，对你的大脑有好处。我们可能拥有世界上所有的知识，但在行动方面，知识、信息和行动之间存在巨大的鸿沟。所以，报复性睡前拖延症就是一种分支。那么会发生什么呢？你知道，你的注意力下降了。你变得易怒、过度警觉。所以，晚上，一天结束时，晚上9点。如果你是父母，你的孩子睡着了，你的厨房干净了，也许你结束了创业的一天，你终于和**Melanie**坐在沙发上，你心想：“哈，一些属于我的时间。”你知道，你想要早点睡觉，你也知道这对你有好处。但突然间，你开始滑动屏幕，不知不觉就到了凌晨2点，你自言自语：“天哪，发生了什么？我为什么还醒着？我一直在做什么？”发生的情况是，你本质上是在晚上给自己一些“我”的时间，所以你拖延了睡觉时间。因此，这种报复性睡前拖延症会影响你的睡眠，而当你没有良好的睡眠，高质量的睡眠时，你就会难以入睡、难以保持睡眠，长期累积的睡眠不足对孩子和成人都会产生各种各样的影响。所以，这只是冰山一角。这种短视频内容及其连锁反应影响深远。它不仅重塑你的大脑，还重塑你的身体，它影响你的睡眠，这会增加你日后患心脏病的风险。当你观看血腥视频和图片时，即使你不在现场，它也可能通过**替代性创伤**增加你患**PTSD**的个人风险。所以，这只是一个庞大的网络，这些事情可能发生在你身上，仅仅因为你认为：“是的，这没什么害处。它是什么？只是一堆我正在看的视频。这是一种放松的方式。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: And to add to that, you know, from the medical perspective, you're shortening this attention span. And what happens over time is so like Jonathan said, right, you're not sleeping as well because you are engaged with your device. We know that 80% of people are checking their phones within minutes of waking up. We have something called revenge bedtime procrastination. this concept of, you know, at the end of the day you're fatigued, you've had a long day, you've had no me time, and you want to get to bed early. We all know, by the way, what the data is that, you know, we've been taught since we were little kids, right? Like bedtime, sleep is important, it's good for your body, it's good for your brain. And we might have all the knowledge in the world, but in terms of action, there's a wide gap between knowledge and information and action. And so revenge, bedtime procrastination is kind of an offshoot. So what happens? So, you know, you have that decreased attention. You have that irritability, hypervigilance. And so, at night, at the end of the day, it's 9:00 p.m. You finally, you know, if you're a parent, your kids are asleep, your kitchen is clean, maybe you finish your entrepreneurial day, and you finally sit down with Melanie on the couch, and you're like, "H, some me time." And, you know, you want to get to bed early, and you know it's good for you. But then suddenly, you're scrolling and before you know it, it's 2 a.m. and you're saying, "Oh my god, what happened? Why am I still awake? What was I doing all this time?" What happens is that you essentially give yourself some me time at night and so you procrastinate bedtime. And so what happens is with this revenge bedtime procrastination, it affects your sleep and then when you don't have good sleep, good quality sleep, so you have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, sleep debt over time for kids, for adults has all sorts of ramifications. So this is just the tip of the iceberg. this short form video content and the ripple effects go far and wide. Not only is it rewiring your brain, it's rewiring your body, it is affecting your sleep, which increases your risk of heart disease later in life. And u when you're consuming graphic videos and graphic images, it can increase your personal risk of PTSD through vicarious trauma even if you weren't there. So, this is just a vast network of things that can happen to you simply because you're thinking, "Yeah, it's harmless. What is it? It's just a bunch of videos that I'm checking out. It's a way for me to decompress."

### 短视频对儿童大脑的劫持

**Stephen**: 我需要了解大脑的哪些特性，才能确切理解短视频是如何发挥作用、劫持并利用大脑的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: What do I need to know about the nature of the brain to understand exactly what short form video is is playing, is hijacking, is taking advantage of

</details>

**Jonathan**: 要理解这一切，我们必须关注童年。为什么我们会有童年？人类的童年非常有趣，我们最初快速成长，然后减缓大约五到七年，我们成长得不快，然后在青春期又加速。而其他灵长类动物，它们只是不断成长，直到达到繁殖年龄，然后繁殖。但我们似乎有这样一段漫长的“中年童年”时期，用于文化学习。这是一个孩子开始走路、说话，并逐渐脱离父母的时期，这是一个他们开始关注并建立关系的时期。所有这些事情都必须缓慢发生，因为神经元正在逐渐生长。它们根据孩子的行为相互连接。所以，我们在真实世界中成长，这需要时间。其中很多是非常身体性的。孩子非常身体化。哺乳动物非常身体化，有很多触摸。所以，那是一个健康的人类童年。但当你给他们一个**iPad**或旧**iPhone**，他们开始触摸和滑动时，那就会劫持他们的注意力。那会排挤所有其他形式的行动和学习。那会改变大脑中学习注意力（即所谓的**执行功能**）的部分。那会改变大脑学习注意力的方式。那会改变**奖励回路**。我想你最近采访过**Analy**，她是全国的成瘾专家。她描述道，任何一种成瘾都会改变你的奖励通路，让你更容易受到其他成瘾的影响。所以，我们不仅让孩子更容易沉迷于此，而且当他们长大一点，就会沉迷于视频游戏、色情内容，现在还有赌博。一切都变成了赌博。所以，我们正在让他们过上这样一种生活：他们的大脑一直在说：“给我点什么。给我一些快速的**多巴胺**。给我一些快速的多巴胺。我不想为任何事情努力。我不想努力一个小时然后才得到奖励。”所以，短视频对孩子的作用是阻止他们学习努力工作与奖励之间的联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: the thing to understand about all of this is that we have to focus on childhood. Why do we have childhood? Um, humans have this really interesting childhood where we we grow rapidly at first and then we slow down for about five or seven years. We don't grow very quickly and then we speed up at puberty. Whereas other primates, they just grow and grow till they reach reproductive age, then they reproduce. But we seem to have this long period of sort of middle childhood for cultural learning. It's a period in which the the kid is now walking and talking and turning away from the parents and and that's a time for this to come in and they pay attention and they form relationships. All these things have to happen slowly because the neurons are gradually growing. They're finding each other based on what the child is doing. Okay? So, we grow up in the real world and and that happens over time. And a lot of that is very physical. Kids are very physical. Mammals are very physical and there's a lot of touch. So, that's a healthy human childhood. But when you give an iPad or your old iPhone and they can they begin doing the the touching and swiping, that is going to hijack their attention. That is going to push out all other forms of action and learning. And that is going to change the way the parts of the brain that learn to pay attention, what's called executive function. It's going to change the way the brain learns to pay attention. It's going to change the reward circuits. I think you had Analy recently who's the nation's expert on addiction. And the way that she describes it, how, you know, any one addiction is going to change your reward pathways to make you more vulnerable to other addictions. So, we're setting our kids up not just for this, but then when they get a little older, it'll be video games, it'll be uh porn, it'll be gambling now. Everything is gambling. So, we're setting them up for a life in which their brain is saying, "Give me something. Give me some quick dopamine. Give me some quick dopamine. I don't want I don't want to have to work for anything. I don't want to have to apply myself for an hour and then get a reward." And so the what the what the short videos are doing for kids is preventing them from learning the connection between hard work and a reward.

</details>

**Stephen**: 从神经科学的角度来看，当我沉迷于短视频或这些快速多巴胺任务时，我的大脑中发生了什么？我还需要知道些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Is there anything else I need to know from a neuroscience perspective about what's going on in my brain when I'm when I develop these addictions with short form videos or these sort of quick dopamineic tasks.

</details>

**Adi**: 所以我们人类都有一个原始的滑动冲动。当你感到压力时，就像我们许多人现在生活中所经历的那样，那是你的**杏仁核**在起作用。所以那是你的自我保护感。它是生存和自我保护。这就是你的杏仁核所做的。如果你想让我给你展示一下，我不知道我在那里做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: So we all as humans have a primal urge to scroll. When you feel a sense of stress, as many of us do in this moment in life, it is your sense, you know, your amygdala. And so it's your sense of self-preservation. It's survival and self-preservation. That is what your amydala does. So if you want me to show you here, I have no idea what I'm doing there.

**Jonathan**: 是的，没关系。所以这里，深处，是一个小的杏仁状结构。那就是你的**杏仁核**。你的杏仁核的主要目的是生存和自我保护。它承载着你的压力反应、你的战斗或逃跑反应，当你感到压力时，它确实会被激活。所以你有一种原始的滑动冲动。从进化的角度来看，当我们都住在洞穴里时，晚上我们会睡觉，会有一个守夜人扫描危险。而现在我们已经成为了自己的守夜人。所以我们整天整夜都在扫描危险。我们怎么做到的？我们滑动。然后杏仁核被触发。然后你再滑动一些，再滑动一些，再滑动一些。所以随着时间的推移，你正在让你的杏仁核处于一种慢性状态。它不断被触发。随着时间的推移，杏仁核会发生什么？当它不断被触发时，它会以其他方式重塑你的大脑。它是如何做到的？通过所谓的**前额叶皮层**。如果你把手放在额头上，就在你额头后面的这个区域就是前额叶皮层。这对我们的对话非常重要。大脑的这个区域，以及前额叶皮层的作用是，它掌管着**执行功能**。所以，冲动控制、记忆、计划、组织、战略思维、复杂问题解决，以及你的杏仁核和前额叶皮层之间存在一种张力。当你的杏仁核处于主导地位时，前额叶皮层就会安静下来。而当我们继续使用设备并拥有这种原始的滑动冲动时，杏仁核就会上调，前额叶皮层就会下调。随着时间的推移，这会带来很多问题，原因就是我们在对话开始时介绍的那些。2025年进行的一项对71项不同研究的荟萃分析发现，大量使用短视频与思维能力下降有关，尤其是注意力广度缩短和冲动控制能力减弱。

**Jonathan**: Yeah, it's okay. So here, deep here, it's a small almond shaped structure. And that is your amygdala. And your amygdala, its main purpose is survival and self-preservation. It houses your stress response, your fight orflight response, and it is truly what is activated when you are engaging in content, when you feel a sense of stress. And so you have this primal urge to scroll. And so evolutionarily we when we all were caves people living um together, we would sleep at night and there would be a night watchman scanning for danger. And now we have our we have become our own night watchman. And so we scan for danger all day, all night long. How do we do that? We scroll. And then the amydala is triggered. And then you scroll some more. And you scroll some more. And you scroll some more. And so over time, what you're doing is that you're making that amygdala in a state of of chronic. It's continually being triggered. What happens to the amygdala over time. When it's continually triggered, it starts to rewire your brain in other ways. And how does it do that? Through something called the prefrontal cortex. If you put your hand I like I can use this model, but I can also just use my hands. When you put your hand on your forehead, the area right behind your forehead right here is the prefrontal cortex. This is a very important thing for our conversation. This area of the brain and what the prefrontal cortex does is it is called it governs executive functions. So impulse control, memory, planning, organization, strategic thinking, complex problem solving and there is a tension between your amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. When your amydala is in the driver's seat, that prefrontal cortex is quiet. And what is happening as we continue to engage with our devices and have this primal urge to scroll, that amydala upregulates and the prefrontal cortex downregulates. And over time, that is very problematic for all of the reasons that we're kind of introducing at the start of this conversation. There was a meta analysis done in 2025 of 71 different studies and it found that heavy short form video use was associated with reduced thinking ability, especially shorter attention spans and weaker impulse control.

### 科技公司的责任与监管

**Jonathan**: 没错。这些研究现在才刚刚开始涌现。孩子们从2008年开始大量使用社交媒体，但尤其是在2012年左右他们有了智能手机之后。2010年代开始出现的研究表明，那些花大量时间在社交媒体上的孩子情况更糟。他们更抑郁。焦点放在抑郁症上。一些其他研究人员说不，这只是相关性。你无法证明因果关系。我们已经为此争论了大约10到15年。现在我们对短视频也在做同样的事情。每个人都能看到其危害。我的学生告诉我这就是正在发生的事情。我们感受到了。研究正在涌现，但会有一些研究没有显示出来，然后人们就会把它推出来。**Meta**花费大量时间和金钱来影响公众辩论。现在有很多公开文件揭示了他们是如何做到这一点的。所以，我们可以就短视频的研究争论5到10年，但到那时，就太晚了。我们已经失去了第二代，**Alpha世代**。所以，我认为当我们谈论孩子时，尤其需要遵循所谓的**预防原则**，即如果我们有理由认为这会伤害孩子，那我们为什么不阻止它进入每个孩子的童年呢？我们为什么不让这些公司承担责任呢？我们让他们对他们对孩子所做的事情负责，因为我们即将重蹈社交媒体的覆辙，让它渗透到童年。我们已经对短视频这样做了，我们即将对**AI聊天机器人**这样做。事实上，我认为我们刚刚在2025年末开始这样做。我认为人们还没有完全意识到这些主要的社交媒体平台已经发现短视频很受欢迎。我们实际上正在看到短剧应用在全球范围内兴起。我不知道你们是否见过这些应用，但它基本上把一部两小时的电影分解成大约60个不同的部分。我公司的一位同事前几天给我展示了，它们在世界各地都在爆发式增长。短剧应用的增长率达到了190%。它把长篇电影变成了短视频。**Disney Plus**计划今年推出**AI**生成的短视频，从**Disney Plus**应用内30秒的限制开始。**TechCrunch**也报道称，截至2025年10月，**Netflix**在手机上测试了短视频内容，并最近宣布了扩大此功能的计划。似乎我们消费的所有内容都将朝着这个方向发展。听着，我与许多大型社交媒体平台的人是朋友。这并不妨碍我批评他们，因为我认为两件事可以同时是真的，对吧？所以，我认为我有一个播客，我制作短视频，同时我也明白它们有真正的缺点，这是事实。我与之交谈的所有主要社交媒体平台都大力推动短视频，这似乎是他们的首要战略重点，显然是因为**TikTok**的成功。截至2026年1月，**TikTok**我相信现在是全球下载量最大的社交应用。而且，如果我经营一家社交媒体公司，我的唯一重点是利润，

**Jonathan**: That's right. These studies are just beginning to roll in now. Um, kids have been on social media really a lot since 2008, but especially once they got smartphones around 2012. studies began coming in uh in the 2010s that um look it's looking like the kids who are spend a lot of time on this um are doing much worse. They're more depressed. The focus was on depression. And some other researchers said no, it's just a correlation. You you can't prove causation. And we've been going around and around on this for about 10 or 15 years. Now we're doing the same thing with uh with the short form videos. The damage everyone can see. My students tell me this is what's happening. We feel it. studies are coming in, but there will be a few studies here and there that don't show it and people will uh push that up. Meta spends a lot of time and money to influence the public debate. A lot of public documents are coming out now about how they do that. So, we can engage in debate over over research on short form videos for 5 or 10 years, but at that point, it's way too late. We've lost a second generation, Gen Alpha. So, I think when we're talking about kids especially, we need to have what's called the precautionary principle, which is if there's reason to think that this is hurting kids, how about we don't roll it out into every childhood? How about we make these companies responsible? We hold them responsible for what they're doing to kids because we're about to make the same mistake we made with social media, letting it worm its way into childhood. We have already done that with short videos, and we're about to do it with AI chat bots. In fact, we're just beginning it in late 2025, I'd say. I I don't think people quite realize how much these major social media platforms have figured out that short form video sells. Um we're actually seeing this sort of global rise in short form drama apps now. And I don't know if you guys have seen these apps, but it basically takes a movie that used to be 2 hours long and it breaks it down into say 60 different parts. And my a colleague of mine at my company was showing me the other day in different parts of the world they're exploding. There's been a 190% increase in short form drama apps. takes long form movie, turns it into short form videos. Disney Plus plans to introduce AI generated short form videos this year, starting with 30 secondond limits inside the Disney Plus app. And Techrunch also reported that as of October 2025, Netflix tested short form video content on phones and recently announced its plan to expand this feature. It appears that all of the content we consume is going that way. And listen, I'm friends with lots of people at big social media platforms. um this doesn't get me in the doesn't sound in my way of criticizing them because I think two things can be true at the same time right so I think it can be true that I have a podcast and I make short form videos and that I also understand that there's a real downside to them and um all of the major social social media platforms that I speak to speak to have a huge drive towards short form video it is it appears to be their number one strategic priority and obviously because of the success of Tik Tok as of January 2026 Tik Tok I believe is the most downloaded social app in the world now and it and and if I'm running a social media company and my one focus is profit,

**Stephen**: 我现在面临着一场生存危机。

**Stephen**: I either take part in this thing that is driving the highest retention, therefore the best ad payouts or I die.

</details>

**Adi**: 对此有两点评论。首先，你知道，当我们思考社交媒体以及社会如何演变以适应这种短视频内容时，有一个概念是**Jonathan**和我之前在拍摄前简要提到过的，叫做“**第二屏观看**”。所以现在发生的情况是，据称这些大型流媒体平台正在要求他们的创意人才，无论是编剧、演员还是导演，重述剧情，因为当你观看时，你知道，我们小时候看电视或电影，你只是坐在沙发上，和家人一起吃一桶爆米花，看一部电影，一小时、一个半小时、两小时。而现在正在发生第二屏观看，这意味着你在看电影或电视节目时，同时还在使用你的设备，所以你的注意力不断被碎片化，我们所有人都在这样做。所以，据称这些流媒体平台正在要求他们的创意人才做的就是重述剧情。所以它正在改变。这很合理，如果我的大脑，你知道，我33岁了，所以我是在这些东西的陪伴下长大的。如果我的大脑已经被训练成注意力广度更短，那么30年前的电影对我来说就不够看了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: So there's two comments to that. first off is that you know when we think when we think about social media and how society is shapeshifting to allow this short form content there is a concept that Jonathan and I briefly mentioned I think prior to us filming called second screen viewing and so what's happening is that allegedly these big streamers are asking their creative talent whether it's screenwriters or actors or pe directors to replay to reiterate the plot because as you're watching, you know, when we were kids, we would watch TV or movies and you just sit on the couch and you'd have a bucket of popcorn with your family and you'd watch a movie, an hour, hour and a half, two hours and now second screen viewing is happening, which means that you're watching a movie or a TV show and you're on your device and so you are constantly having that fragmented attention and we are all doing it and so what these streamers are allegedly asking their creative talent to do is to reiterate the plot. So it's shapeshifting. It makes sense if my brain is, you know, I'm 33 years old, so I've grown up with a lot of this stuff. If my brain has been wired to have shorter attention spans and and movies from 30 years ago are not going to cut it for me,

</details>

**Jonathan**: 对吧？但如果每个人都追逐这个，那会发生什么呢？我知道，你看，**Netflix**正在制作越来越短的内容。甚至**TED**大会，**TED**演讲也越来越短。这会带来什么？它只会重复这个循环。现在，我很理解你正处于一个“**集体行动困境**”中，正如你所说。如果我不做，而其他人都在做，那我就会输。所以，所有创作者的商业压力都促使内容越来越短。这里有一个非常有用的心理学术语区分，我认为会有帮助，那就是**心理同化**和**适应**之间的区别。这可以追溯到伟大的发展心理学家**让·皮亚杰**。我们有某些心智结构。我们头脑中有一个关于事物如何运作的模型。然后你学到一些新东西，哦，那是一个，你知道，孩子学到哦，那是一个土豚，好的，我把它放进去，你知道，那只是你同化了，他们学到了很多动物的名字，然后他们学到了一些不符合的东西，比如你学到了细菌，现在你必须，哦，好的，现在你必须改变你的心智结构，这需要一点时间，你改变你的心智结构来更多地理解生活，这就是教育的真正意义所在，你当然需要大量的同化，但你需要一次又一次的适应。这就是为什么你想上大学。这就是为什么你想读小说。这就是一部好电影的作用。它需要时间。所以，现代技术的一大优点是我们可以做像这样三个小时的对话。我简直不敢相信。人们会听的。所以，这种长篇内容。这完全是关于适应。任何一个在三个小时后离开这次对话而没有对某些事情有不同看法的人，我们都失败了。好的。所以，你非常专注于适应业务。这很棒。然后，道德和战略上的问题是，你需要多大程度地参与这种快速点击游戏才能吸引人们。我把道德计算留给你来做。也许它会平衡，也许会，但我想这就是你所处的位置。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: right? But then look what happens if if everybody chases that. And I know, look, Netflix is making shorter and shorter stuff. Even TED, the TED conference, TED talks are getting shorter and shorter. What does that do? It just repeats the cycle. Now, I appreciate that you're in a collective action trap, as you put it. If I don't do it and everyone else is, then I lose out. And so, the the business pressure on on all the creators, the business pressures go shorter, shorter, shorter. There's a very useful psychological term distinction here that I think would be helpful, which is the difference between psychological assimilation and accommodation. This goes back to Jean PG, the great developmental psychologist. We we have certain mental structures. We have a a model in our head of how things work. And you know then you learn something new then oh that's a you know kid learns oh that's a an arvar okay I put that into you know that's just that you just assimilate they learn lots of animal names and then they learn something that's doesn't fit like you learn about bacteria and now you have to oh okay now you you have you have to change your mental structure it takes a little time you change your mental structure to understand more about life that's what education really is all about you have to have a lot of assimilation of course but you need that accommodation over and over again That's why you want to go to college. That's why you want to read novels. That's what a great movie does. It takes time. And so, one of the great things about this modern technology is that we can do things like have this three-hour conversation. I can't believe it. People are going to listen to it. So, this, you know, long form content. This is all about accommodation. Anybody who walks out who who who leaves this conversation after 3 hours and isn't thinking about something differently, we failed. Okay. So, you are very much in the accommodation business. That's great. And then the the question both a moral and a strategic question is how much do you need to play the the quick hit game in order to get people there. I leave that to you to do the moral calculation. Maybe it maybe it balances out maybe but uh but I think that's where you are.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你会建议人们删除这些短视频吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Would you advise people to delete these short form?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 天哪。是的。当然。是的。那将是你为你的智力和人类所能做的最重要的事情，就是删除它们。所以，我建议我的学生这样做。我只是说，就这样做。只需删除你使用的社交媒体应用中的一个，特别是如果它是**TikTok**，就从你的手机上删除。你仍然可以在电脑上查看。如果有人给你发视频，你仍然可以在电脑上观看。你甚至可以，你知道，每个周末查看一下，花点时间在上面，但就是把它从你的手机上删除，因为手机总是在我们身边。它是我们身体的延伸。如果它总是在那里，那么它就会占据一切，这被称为“**注意力压裂**”。它会分散你的注意力。它会占据你每7秒钟没有做任何事情的时间，你就会拿起手机。所以，我认为，让你自己更聪明、成为更好的伴侣、更好的人，最好的方法就是删除短视频，尤其是任何短视频应用。所以，不幸的是，**TikTok**，**YouTube**（上面有很多好东西）变成了**YouTube Shorts**。**Instagram**（它做了很多糟糕的事情，但人们确实发现它对各种目的都有用）变成了**Instagram Reels**。所以，我认为儿童（0到18岁）的短视频适量是零。他们绝不应该观看竖屏视频。父母们，绝不要让你的孩子观看短竖屏视频。你甚至可以，如果有一种方法可以做到的话。有没有办法设置时间限制？你可以说它必须是10分钟或更长。孩子们，你们可以看一个小时的**YouTube**，但它必须是10分钟或更长。任何短于10分钟的都不行。那至少可以摆脱这种快速滑动、多巴胺的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Oh my god. Yes. Of course. Here but here. Yes. That would the most important thing you can do for your intelligence and for humanity would be delete them. So, what I advise my students to do is I say just do this. Just just delete one of the social media apps that you use, especially if it's Tik Tok, just delete from your phone. You can still check on your computer. If someone sends you a video, you can still watch it on your computer. You can even check it, you know, every weekend. You can spend some time on it, but just get it off your phone because on the phone, the phone is always with us. It's an extension of our body. And if it's always there, then it's going to take every it's called attention fracking. It's going to break up your attention. It's going to take every 7 seconds that you're not doing something, you're going to go for the phone. So, the best thing you can do to make yourself smarter and a better partner and a better human, I would say, would be to delete the short, especially any of the short form videos. So, Tik Tok, unfortunately, YouTube, which has a lot of good stuff on it, becomes YouTube shorts. Instagram, which does a lot of terrible things, but people do find it useful for all kinds of purposes, becomes Instagram reels. So, I think the proper amount of short form video for children 0 to 18 is zero. They should never be watching the vertical videos. Parents, don't ever let your kids watch the short vertical videos. You might even if there if only there was a way to put it. Is there a way to put a time limit? You can say it has to be 10 minutes or longer. Kids, you can have an hour YouTube, but it has to be 10 minutes or longer. Nothing shorter than 10 minutes. That at least will get rid of this the quick the quick swiping the the dopamine stuff.

</details>

**Adi**: 所以我会说，对于孩子，是的，就像你说的，完全不参与。但对于像30多岁或40多岁的人，我的方法有点不同。我会这样来构思：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: So I would say that for kids yes like you know not engaging it whatsoever but for someone you know my approach is a little bit different for someone who's like in their 30s or in their 40s and the way I would kind of frame that is

</details>

**Adi**: 与其放弃，你知道，说我要把它从我的设备上删除，我要在台式机上查看（这很好），我们可以做一些小的调整，因为我的方法是培养一种赋权感，帮助他们做出积极的改变。所以，如果你说你绝不会从手机上删除这些应用，对吧？顺便说一下，我言行一致，我真的尽我所能不使用技术。但你可以做的一件事是把手机屏幕调成灰度。尤其是在晚上，比如晚上9点，就像我们谈到的**报复性睡前拖延症**。你知道你会这样做。你会坐下来滑动，不知不觉就到了凌晨2点。相反，把你的手机调成灰度。这个简单的开关，你可以切换。我的手机就设置成了灰度，这意味着你去掉了颜色，把它变成了黑白。所以，当它变成灰度时，你知道，它就没有那种相同的成瘾性了。这就像逛杂货店一样。一位营销主管这样向我描述：逛杂货店，不是看那些彩色垃圾食品麦片，而只是黑白的。所以你不太会有一种更强的冲动去不断查看。所以这是一种你可以使用的策略。另一种是设置一些界限。地理上的界限，把手机放在手臂够不到的地方，如果你在办公桌前，如果你是学生，不要放在你旁边，因为我们知道有**大脑耗竭**这种现象。所以不仅仅是当你使用手机时它可能造成分心，而是仅仅把它放在附近。这被称为大脑耗竭。所以把它放在抽屉里，如果你在工作，把它放在家里的另一个地方，让它远离你。这样你就可以克服那种原始的滑动冲动，让你的**前额叶皮层**再次掌控。所以你可以做所有这些小调整。你觉得不？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: instead of renouncing you know saying I'm going to get it off my device and I'm going to check on a desktop which is great there's c little kind of tweaks that we could do because my approach is to foster that sense of empowerment in one to help them make positive change. And so one strategy that you could use if you are saying there's no way I'm getting rid of my I'm not deleting these apps from my phone, right? If you're by the way, I practice what I preach and I really do don't engage in technology as to the best of my ability. Um but one thing that you could do is grayscale your phone. And so especially at night like it's 9:00 p.m. like we talked about revenge bedtime procrastination. You know that you're going to do it. you're going to sit down and you're going to scroll and before you know it, it's 2 am. Instead, grayscale your phone. This simple switch. You can toggle it. I have my phone set to grayscale, which simply means that you're getting rid of your color, making it black and white. And so, when it is grayscaled, then you, you know, it doesn't have that same addictive quality to it. It's like going through a grocery store. A marketing executive described it this way to me. Going through a grocery store instead of the technicolor junk food cereal, it's just black and white. So you have a less there's a greater sense of compulsion to continue checking. So that's like one strategy you could use. And the other is to set some boundaries. So geographical boundaries, keep your phone out of out of your arms reach if you're at a desk if you're a student, not right next to you because we know there's this phenomenon of brain drain. So it's not just that when you're using your phone, it can have a potential distraction, but also just having it close by. It's called brain drain. And um so putting it in a desk drawer, keeping it in another part of the home if you are working, keeping it far away from you. And so you kind of can override that primal urge to scroll, let your prefrontal cortex take hold again. And so there's all these small tweaks that you can do. You you think no.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的，你可以做所有这些小调整，它们会让海洛因的成瘾性稍微降低一点。是的，你应该尝试这些。但根据我多年教授这门课程的经验，那些尝试过的人会说：“是的，你知道，它有帮助。它有帮助，但你只有在戒掉社交媒体后才能真正获得转变，才能找回你的生活。你每天能找回好几个小时。”所以，我会敦促每个人都思考一下，你知道，你只有一次童年，你只有一次青年时期，如果你把它们都花在滑动屏幕上，最后你有什么可展示的呢？当你让人们反思，你从观看短视频中真正获得了多少价值？如果你戒掉它，你的生活会有什么不同？一旦他们意识到他们使用它的动机要么只是为了跟上潮流，要么是因为其他人都在这样做，或者像你说的，我累了，所以我值得这样做。那么，你为什么累呢？部分原因是因为你的注意力整天都被碎片化了。所以，你只有在真正改变你所消费的内容时，才能真正获得转变。当然，是的，把它设置为灰度会有帮助，但我相信它对大多数人来说不会是变革性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yes, there are all these small tweaks you can do and they will make the heroin a little bit less addictive. And yeah, you should try those. But what I can say after teaching this course for many years is that people who try that, they they report, "Yeah, you know, it helped. it helped, but you only really get the transformation when you quit social media that you get your life back. You get hours a day back. So, um, and so I I would urge everyone to just think, you know, you only you only get one childhood, you only get one one young adulthood, and if you're going to spend it scrolling, what do you have to show for it at the end? And when you get people to reflect on, well, how much value do you really get from watching the short videos? What would how would your life be different if you if you knocked it out? Once they realize that their motives for being on it were either just to keep up or because that's what everyone else is doing or as you said, I deserve it because I'm tired. Well, why are you tired? It's in part because your attention was fragmented all day long. So, you only really get the transformations when you get a real change in what you're what you're consuming. Although, of course, yes, setting it to grace will be helpful, but it's not going to be transformative for most people, I believe.

</details>

**Adi**: 然后，你知道，根据科学，当你思考手机的哪些元素会产生那种强迫感时，**Jonathan**说得对。那么手机有什么特别之处呢？它不仅仅是手机，你知道，你在滑动，你在参与。有两项研究非常有趣。一项是人们停止使用互联网，但继续使用他们的设备。所以，就像，你知道，我自己在12月尝试了这个实验。我当时在国外，所以我就让我的手机，你知道，我没有连接Wi-Fi，我发现，你知道，我的情绪、睡眠都发生了显著变化，我甚至不是，你知道，20岁的**TikTok**用户，但感觉非常不同。所以这项研究发现，仅仅两周的持续使用设备但没有互联网访问，就能改善你的注意力、幸福感和心理健康。在这个人群中，都是成年人，不是孩子，都是成年人。研究发现91%的人在至少一项指标上有所改善。然后最近的另一项研究，仅仅一周不使用社交媒体，他们称之为“**数字排毒**”，也产生了同样的效果。焦虑减轻，抑郁减轻，失眠减少。但我的感觉是，你知道，现在有一种新的网络迷因，就像千禧一代渴望删除我的互联网存在，你知道，过上离网生活。这当然有其用处，我向任何想要更多地参与那种模拟生活的人致敬，但从我的角度来看，我觉得我们需要建立更健康的界限，更负责任地参与。它也能锻炼那种“肌肉”，并有所帮助，你知道，神经可塑性需要八周才能实现。当你建立新的大脑回路时，需要八周。跌倒了再爬起来是习惯养成的一部分。所以，如果你要做出任何这些改变，请明白这需要一些时间。但我不知道我或其他人是否可能完全做到，你知道，从手机上删除。但我喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: And then you know based on the science you're there's certain elements like when we think about what is it about the phone that is creating that sense of compulsion. Jonathan is right. So what is it about the phone? It's not just the phone you know you're scrolling you're engaging. There are two studies that were really interesting. One people got off of they they continue to use their devices. They had no internet. So it's like you know I tried this experiment myself in December. I was out of the country and so I just let my, you know, I didn't plug into Wi-Fi and I found, you know, marketkedly a marketked change in my mood, my sleep and I'm not even, you know, 20 years old on TikTok and it was so different. And so this study found that just two weeks of continuing to use your device, but just not having internet access improved your attention, well-being, and mental health. And in this population, it was all adults, it wasn't kids, it was all adults. found that 91% of people had an improvement in at least one of these metrics. And then another study more recently um just one week of not engaging in social media, digital detox they called it, did the same thing. Better you know less anxiety, less depression, decreased insomnia. But my feeling is that you know there is this new kind of meme right like your the millennial urge to delete uh my internet presence and you know live off the grid. There is certainly utility to that and I salute anyone who wants to engage in that analog life more and more but from my from where I sit I feel like we do need to have healthier boundaries and engage more responsibly. It also builds up that muscle and it can help, you know, takes eight weeks to do neuroplasticity. When you're building new brain circuits, it takes eight weeks. Falling off, getting back up is part of habit formation. So, if you're going to make any of these changes, understand that it takes some time. But I I don't know if it is possible for me or for others to say fully, I'm going to, you know, delete off of my phone. But I love that.

**Jonathan**: 这就像我们对待垃圾食品一样。对于垃圾食品，我们说，好吧，它就在那里。我们必须学会自控。我们必须教我们的孩子自控。好的，在这个国家就是这样。但我认为数字设备非常非常不同。所以，想象一下，如果我们把孩子送到这个世界，不仅仅是所有商店里都有垃圾食品。而是所有东西都是由垃圾食品制成的。你知道，门把手，你可以吃它。它是巧克力。但这不仅仅是世界是由垃圾食品制成的。他们实际上能够知道你此刻渴望什么。也许你更想吃咸的。所以现在都是薯片或椒盐脆饼。如果这个世界是由公司设计的，总是给你最能抓住你潜意识欲望的东西，会影响**杏仁核**、**奖励中心**，那是他们的错。那不是我们的错。作为一名社会心理学家，我的普遍规则是，如果少数人做了一些坏事或自我毁灭的事情，那么，你知道，他们应该学会一些自控，或者那与他们有关。但当90%或95%的人做了一些自我毁灭的事情时，那是因为那些公司把我们置于一个鼓励成瘾的环境中。所以，我只想读一段引文。我们从**Meta**和所有举报人那里得到了很多好东西。现在，所有在洛杉矶开始的法庭案件。最终，**Meta**将首次面对陪审团，与所有失去孩子的父母一起。所以，这里有一段聊天记录。我们有很多内部文件，这些文件来自起诉**Meta**的总检察长。所以，当他们谈论他们的一些内部研究结果时，其中一人说：“天哪，各位，**Instagram**是一种毒品。我们基本上是毒贩。我们正在导致**奖励缺陷障碍**，因为人们过度沉迷于**Instagram**，以至于他们再也感觉不到奖励了。”这就像**Anna LMKI**说的，奖励耐受性太高了。然后他说，我知道**Adam**（指**Adam Mosseri**），我知道**Adam**不想听，当我谈到青少年基础知识领导力审查中的**多巴胺**时，他吓坏了，但这是不可否认的，它是生物学和心理学上的。自上而下的指令驱使一切，确保人们不断回来寻求更多。这不是我们的错。他们设计它就是为了让人上瘾。他们进行了研究，使其最大限度地成瘾。他们把它推给孩子。他们甚至试图为更小的孩子推出**Instagram Kids**。他们知道自己在做什么。他们已经做了研究。我的团队，我们整理了一下。我们发现了**Meta**进行的31项内部研究的参考文献。他们做了很多研究，发现了危害。他们掩盖了它，但你可以在**meta's internal research.org**上找到它。我们把所有这些都放在了网上。你可以阅读这些引文。所以，是的，我们应该多加自控，但基本上我们正被推向成瘾物质、成瘾应用，这让我们都一团糟。

**Jonathan**: And that's where we are with junk food. With junk food, we're like, okay, it's out there. We have to learn self-control. We have to teach self-control to our kids. Okay, that's the way it is in this country. But the digital devices, I think, are very, very different. So, imagine if imagine if we sent our kids out into the world and it wasn't just that there was junk food in all the stores. was that everything was made of junk food. You know, you you know, the door handles, you can eat it. It's chocolate. But it's not just that the world's made of junk food. It's they actually can tell they're able to tell what you're craving at the moment. And maybe you're you're more in the mood for salt. So So now it's all potato chips or pretzels. If the world is designed by companies to always give you the thing that will most grab your unconscious desires, will affect the the amydala, the reward centers, that's on them. That's not our fault. My general rule as a social psychologist is if a few people are doing something bad or self-destructive, well, you know, they should learn some self-control or that's something about them. But when 90 or 95% of people are doing something self-destructive, that's because of the companies that put us in an environment that encourages addiction. So, I just want to read a quote. We have so much good stuff coming out from Meta, from all the whistleblowers. Now, all the court cases are beginning in Los Angeles. finally the first time they're going to Meta is going to face a jury with all the parents who've lost kids. Um, so here is here's a a chat. So, we have a lot of internal documents that came out from the the attorneys general that are suing Meta. So, while they're talking about the results of some of their internal research, one of them says, uh, "Oh my gosh, y'all, Instagram is a drug. We're basically pushers. We're causing reward deficit disorder because people are binging on in Instagram so much they can't feel reward anymore." which is something Anna LMKI said like the reward tolerance is so high and then he says I know Adam meaning Adam Oeri I know Adam doesn't want to hear it he freaked out when I talked about dopamine in my teen fundamentals leads review but it is undeniable it's biological and psychological top-down directives drive it all towards making sure people keep coming back for more. This is not on us. They designed it to be addictive. They've done research to make it maximally addictive. They push it on children. They tried to get Instagram kids for even littleer kids. They know what they're doing. They've done the research. My team, we put together. We found references to 31 internal studies that Meta did. They've done a lot of research finding harm. They bury it, but you can find it at meta's internal research.org. We put it all online. You can read these quotes. So, yes, we should exert more self-control, but basically we're being pushed addictive substances, addictive uh addictive apps, and it's messing us all up.

**Adi**: 我完全同意它具有如此大的破坏性，你觉得即使是40多岁和50多岁的人，如果有人能做到，那就是你，**Jonathan**。说真的，我很想看到。你知道，我们还根据数据知道，这些东西确实通过**神经可塑性**重塑我们的大脑，并改变我们的脑电波。所以模式。我们谈到了**杏仁核**和**前额叶皮层**，对吧？但它们也改变脑电波。所以当你查看研究和数据时，它有奖励通路和**多巴胺**。这些大脑模式、脑电波模仿了成瘾行为。你知道它有一些特点，对吧？比如当你向下滑动刷新时，它就像老虎机。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: I agree wholeheartedly that it is so destructive, and you feel like even with people in their 40s and 50s, and if anyone can do it, it's you, Jonathan. Seriously, I would love to see it. You know, we also know based on the data that these things quite they they reshape our brain, rewire our brain through neuroplasticity and also change our brain waves. So patterns. So we talked about the amydala and the prefrontal cortex, right? But they also change brain waves. And so when you look at studies and the data, it has the reward pathway and dopamine. And these brain patterns, the brain waves mimic addictive behaviors. And you know that there's certain features, right? like when you do swipe down to refresh, it's the slot machine.

**Adi**: 或者自动播放，或者，你知道，那个无限滚动的算法。有一个非常有趣的突发新闻，你们可能已经听说了。大约三天前，**欧盟委员会**发现**TikTok**违反了《**数字服务法案**》。它说**TikTok**具有成瘾性。它，你知道，会产生强迫症，让人们进入这种自动驾驶模式，所以他们很难脱离。我个人正在远离社交媒体，真正倾向于模拟生活，但我认为以世界目前的方式，你知道，它是我们唯一的连接方式之一，对吧？我的意思不是深入连接，我的意思不是以一种深刻的方式连接，而是了解世界上正在发生的事情等等。

**Adi**: Or autoplay or um you know the algorithm that infinite scroll. Um one really interesting kind of like breaking news which you guys may have already heard of. It's like 3 days ago the European Union Commission found Tik Tok to be in breach of the digital services act. And what it said was that it is addictive. it um you know creates compulsion and gets people into this autopilot mode so they have difficulty disengaging and personally I am moving away from social media and really leaning into analog life but I think with the way the world you know it's one of our only ways to connect right meaning I don't mean connect deeply I don't mean connect like in a deep way but be informed to know what's going on in the world etc

**Stephen**: 我怀疑，因为我们过去10年一直在批评**Meta**，因为任何类别中最大的公司都会承受所有压力。所以，现在**OpenAI**正在承受压力。而这通常会为其他人提供掩护，让他们在**Meta**承受压力的同时，采取更极端的行为。我实际上认为**TikTok**就是这样诞生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I I suspect that because we've spent so long criticizing meta over the last 10 years because the biggest in any category takes all the heat. So, OpenAI is taking it now. And what this often does is is it provides cover for other people to go be even more extreme with that behavior while like meta take the heat. And I actually think this is how Tik Tok came to be.

</details>

**Stephen**: **TikTok**最初是**Musical.ly**，后来变成了**TikTok**。他们当时没有任何压力。所以他们创造了一个算法，这相当于**可卡因**。我之所以有一个**TikTok**账户，但我手机上没有这个应用，我手机上从来没有这个应用，我没有，那是因为我注意到**TikTok**上的观看量差异是其他平台无法比拟的。我的意思是，你可以在**TikTok**上拥有100万粉丝，但你可能只获得1万次观看，或者你可能获得1000万次观看。在我从事社交媒体、建立社交媒体业务的15年里，我从未见过这种情况。这向我表明，这个算法是一个更具侵略性的分类器或留存机器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Tik Tok had basically originally started as musically became Tik Tok. They had they were take they were taking no heat. Um, so they they created an algorithm which is the equivalent of like crack cocaine. The reason why I have a Tik Tok account. I don't have the app on my phone. I have never had the app on my phone. I don't I don't was because I I noticed that the view variance on Tik Tok was like no other platform. What I mean by that is you can have a million followers on Tik Tok and you can get 10,000 views or you can get 10 million views. In the 15 years that I've been on social media, building social media businesses, I'd never seen this before. And what it indicated to me is that the algorithm was being an even more aggressive sorting hat or retention machine.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 决定推什么，压什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: What to push up, what to push down.

</details>

**Stephen**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yeah.

</details>

**Stephen**: 所以，当我在2014年开始做社交媒体时，如果我有100万粉丝，我可能会得到100万次观看，或者80万次。我前几天对我们所有社交渠道的历史数据做了一些研究，我们发现观看量的差异正在增加，这意味着算法正在做更多的工作来决定“把这个展示给所有人，我不在乎发布者是不是叫**Jenny**，只有七个粉丝”，或者“不要把这个展示给任何人，我不在乎发布者是不是**Steven**，有一百万粉丝”等等。我意识到**TikTok**在这方面遥遥领先于所有人。这就是为什么它是最容易上瘾、增长最快的平台。我之所以说这些，是想说明，即使**Meta**明天关闭，如果没有任何政策，其他人也会抓住这个机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And so, like, when I started in social media in 2014, if I had a million followers, I might get a million views or maybe 800,000. I did some research the other day on all of our social channels over time and what we're seeing is the variance in the amount of views we can get is increasing which means the algorithm is doing more work to say show everyone this. I don't care if the person that posted it is called Jenny and has seven followers and show no one this. I don't care if it's Steven who has a million followers or whatever. And I realized that Tik Tok was was way ahead of everybody here. And that's why they are the most addictive, the fastest growing platform. I say all this to say that even if meta shut down tomorrow, someone else would seize the opportunity if there isn't sort of policy, I I guess

</details>

**Stephen**: 到位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: in place.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: That's right.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你会打地鼠吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Would you be whack-a-ole, right?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。不，没错。所以，你知道，就谁对孩子造成了伤害而言，**Meta**通过**Instagram**是最大的“鱼”。他们也是在游说国会和阻挠法律方面花费巨额资金的主要参与者。他们也是通过收买公民社会组织、向**全国家长教师协会**等各种组织提供资金的主要参与者。然后这些组织就可以传递关于数字公民或数字健康的信息。所以，**Meta**确实是主要的推动者。**Meta**在这里就像烟草行业，试图改变对话。但就产品而言，**Snapchat**在每用户实际死亡人数方面可能更致命，因为**Snapchat**并没有像社交比较那样让你感到抑郁。**Snapchat**让你接触各种各样的人，它是毒贩和勒索者寻找孩子的主要方式。**Snapchat**有一个快速广告功能，会不断地推动你与朋友的朋友建立联系。所以一旦一个人能接触到学校里的任何一个孩子，他现在就能接触到学校里的所有孩子。所以，在很多法庭案件中，你知道，当你遇到网络欺凌导致的自杀，你遇到吸毒过量（比如一个孩子买了**Xanax**，但里面含有**芬太尼**）。所以，**Snapchat**在2022年，我们从他们的内部文件和诉讼中得知，他们每月收到1万份来自用户的性勒索报告，不是一年，是每月。这只是报告出来的，只是冰山一角。所以，**Snapchat**对儿童来说是一个糟糕的平台。它应该是一个只供成人使用的平台。你正在与世界各地的陌生人交谈，而且消息会消失，**Snapchat**甚至不保留记录。它非常适合性勒索。甚至有一本关于如何在**Snapchat**上勒索孩子的**手册**。它在世界各地流传，犯罪组织都在使用它。所以，我绝对不想放过**Snapchat**。**TikTok**当然是一家中国公司。我的意思是，名义上是，我们会看看是否有所改变，但它是一家中国公司，它给中国孩子提供了健康的**TikTok**或**抖音**，他们学会了关注宇航员，他们给我们的算法推送的是爱国内容。它在晚上某个时间会关闭。有很多限制。所以，制造技术的人通常会保护自己的孩子，他们希望其他孩子使用它。这就是**TikTok**在中国所做的。他们希望美国孩子下地狱，但他们希望自己的孩子能够专注地成长。硅谷的科技大佬也是如此。他们不让自己的孩子使用这些东西。他们让保姆签署合同，不让孩子玩手机。他们不让孩子接触这些。他们把孩子送到像**华德福学校**这样的学校，正是因为教室里没有电脑或技术。所以，我们再次看到了他们的真实行为。他们知道他们设计它就是为了让人上瘾。他们知道它会上瘾。他们不让自己的孩子使用它。他们希望你的孩子使用它。所以，我认为这就是我们所处的境地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. No, that's right. And so, you know, in terms of who's done the damage to kids, Meta is the big fish via Instagram. And they're also the main player in terms of spending a huge amount of money to lobby Congress and ch and block laws. They're also the main player in buying up civil society organizations, giving money to organizations, the national PTA, all sorts of organizations. They get to then give a message on digital citizenship or digital health. So, Meta really is the major driver. Meta is the tobacco industry here trying to change the the dialogue. But in terms of the products, um, Snapchat is probably more deadly in terms of the actual number of deaths per user because Snapchat is not it's not making you depressed by social comparison as much. Snapchat is introducing you to all kinds of people and it's the main way that drug dealers and and extortionists find kids. Snapchat has a quick ad feature which relentlessly pushes you to connect with friends of friends. So once a man can get any f any kid in a school, now he can get connected to all the kids in the school. So, uh, when we in a lot of the court cases, you know, when you have you have suicides from cyber bullying, you have drug overdoses from, you know, a kid bought a Xanax, but it had fentinel in it. So, Snapchat at Snapchat in TW in in 2022, we know from their internal documents, from the lawsuits, they were getting 10,000 reports of sextortion from their users, not a year, every month. And that's just what was reported, which is the tip of the iceberg. So, Snapchat is a terrible platform for children to be on. It should be an adult-only platform. You're talking with strangers around the world and and on with disappearing messages and Snapchat doesn't even keep a record. It is ideal for sextortion. There's even a handbook how to stor kids on Snapchat. It goes around the world and and criminal organizations use it. So, uh so I definitely don't want to let Snapchat off. Tik Tok of course is a Chinese company. Uh I mean nominally we'll see if it if that's changed but it was a Chinese company that gave its Chinese kids got healthy Tik Tok or doyen and they got they got they they you know learned to follow astronauts and they gave us the their their algorithm feeds their kid patriotic stuff. Um it shuts off at a certain time at night. There's all kinds of limits. So the people make the technology generally want to protect their own kids and they want other kids to use it. That's what Tik Tok is doing in China. They want American kids to rot in hell, but they want their kids to grow up with the ability to focus. And it's the same thing with the tech guys in in in Silicon Valley. They don't let their kids use this stuff. They make their nannies sign contracts that they will not let the kid have a phone. They will not expose the kid to that. They send their kids to schools like the Waldorf school that precisely because there are no computers or tech in the classroom. So once again, we see their reveal behavior. They know they designed it to be addictive. They know it's addictive. They don't let their kids use it. they want your kids to use it. Um, so I think that's where we are.

### AI聊天机器人：新的威胁

**Stephen**: 那么**AI**是如何成为这个故事的主角的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And how does AI become a protagonist in the story?

</details>

**Adi**: 所以我目前的工作重点是**AI聊天机器人**、心理健康和人际连接。我们还没有深入探讨孤独感，但存在一种未被满足的人际连接需求，对吗？深层次的人际连接。我们现在缺乏意义感或目标感，因为，当我们不允许自己感到无聊时（因为你总是在使用设备），你的**默认模式网络**会发生什么？那种意义感和目标感，那种自我参照的思考，实际上是在你感到无聊时才发展起来的。所以我们谈论的所有这些，那种幻灭感。这是一个碎片化的社会。你独自一人。这就是**回音室效应**。所有这些都导致它为**AI聊天机器人**打开了大门。原因在于这些科技公司感觉到人们在社交媒体上并不真正快乐，他们正在考虑退出，对吗？他们使用得越来越少。因为社交媒体已经变得不那么社交，更多的是媒体。所以他们不再那么积极地参与，他们花时间做其他事情。**《大西洋月刊》**有一篇关于这个的精彩文章。他们将其描述为“**反社交媒体**”。所以科技公司正在构建**AI聊天机器人**，并称之为“反社交媒体”。这是一个你可以建立更深层次连接的地方，你知道，真正有人理解你。一位科技领袖说，人类对连接有一种未被满足的需求，人们没有他们想要的朋友那么多，所以我们将通过**AI聊天机器人**引入友谊。现在**Reddit**上有一个论坛。所以，回到**AI聊天机器人**，我们今天对话中谈论的是公开可用的聊天机器人，而不是，你知道，用于医疗保健的**AI**，它在我的领域和医学领域有很多奇妙的应用，比如通过**AI**提前五年诊断和检测乳腺癌。我的意思是，**AI**正在带来一些惊人的东西。这里谈论的是公开可用的对话式聊天机器人现象。所以当**《哈佛商业评论》**发现第一大用例不是生产力，不是，你知道，编程或你使用**AI聊天机器人**时会想到的东西，而是心理健康治疗和陪伴。这是**AI聊天机器人**的第一大用例。所以人们正在使用**AI聊天机器人**作为生活顾问、治疗师、伴侣，在**Reddit**上，这就像是时代精神。它有点像，你知道，那里…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: So my my work is now focused on AI chatbots, mental health, and the human connection. We haven't yet kind of delved into loneliness, but there's this unmet need for human connection, right? Deep human connection. We don't have a sense of meaning or purpose right now because what happens is uh we can talk a little bit more about the default mode network and what happens to your brain when you don't allow yourself to get bored because you're constantly on your devices and that meaning and purpose that self-reerential thinking is really what develops when you're bored. And so all of this that we're talking about that feeling of disenchantment. It's a fragmented society. You're by yourself. It's that echo chamber phenomenon. All of it leads to it kind of opens the door for AI chatbots. And so what the reason is because these tech companies are sensing that people aren't really happy on social media and they're thinking about getting off, right? They're they're using it less. They're because social media has become less social, more media. So they're not really engaging as much and they're spending time doing other things. And so The Atlantic had a fantastic piece about this. They're building it as the antisocial media. So tech companies are building AI chatbots and calling it it's the antisocial media. It's a place where you can go to form deeper connections and you know really have someone understand you. One of the tech leaders said that there's an unmet human need for connection and people don't have as many friends as they want to and so we're going to introduce um friendship through AI chatbots. There is a Reddit forum right now. So just to back up AI chatbots, what we're talking about in our conversation today is the publicly available chat bots, not you know AI for medical care which has um you know breast cancer so many wonderful in in my field and like medicine breast cancer diagnoses and detection 5 years earlier through AI. I mean there's some amazing things coming out of AI. This is about the publicly available conversational chatbot phenomenon. And so when Harvard Business Review found that the number one use case is not productivity is not, you know, coding or things that you think of when you're using an AI chatbot, but it's mental health therapy and companionship. Number one use case of AI chatbots. So people are using AI chatbots as a life adviser, as a therapist, as as a companion in on Reddit, which is like the zeitgeist. It's sort of like, you know, where

**Stephen**: use it as for companionship, for example.

**Adi**: 关于**AI聊天机器人**有太多危险信号。**Reddit**上有一个论坛，我上次查看时大约有45,000人，叫做“**AI是我的男朋友**”。你知道，人们正在与他们的**AI聊天机器人**建立关系。之所以不好，我的意思是，**AI聊天机器人**，你知道，如果说社交媒体是关于注意力，注意力经济，**多巴胺**。那么**AI聊天机器人**现象正在发生什么？它正在形成**依恋**。所以**催产素**是一种激素，是**结合激素**，我们可能会看到更多关于催产素如何参与的数据。所以它将重塑人际连接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: There's so many red flags about AI chat bots. And so Reddit has a forum. It's uh I think last I checked 45,000 people. AI is my boyfriend. And you know, people who are having a relationship with their AI chatbot. The reason it's bad, I mean AI chat bots are, you know, where social media is about attention, the attention economy, dopamine. What's happening with the AI chatbot phenomenon? It's that it is forming attachments. So oxytocin is a hormone, the bonding hormone, and we're probably going to see more data on how oxytocin is involved. And so it is going to reshape human connection.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 对吧？如果我能补充一点，那说得太好了。社交媒体来劫持了我们的注意力，并以毁灭性的方式夺走了我们大部分的注意力。现在**AI**正在来劫持我们的**依恋**，这将产生更具毁灭性的影响。所以这样想：每个人都需要理解**依恋系统**。这是一个所有哺乳动物都拥有的奇妙系统，它使母亲（对人类来说是父母）与孩子保持连接，孩子与父母保持连接。但它是一个**控制论系统**，孩子在发展过程中，能够像你玩躲猫猫游戏那样，来回互动，这真是最令人愉快的事情。你得到那种来回的互动。这被称为“**服务与回报互动**”，孩子一直在发展所谓的父母的**内部工作模型**。他们头脑中的模型是，哦，你知道，当我遇到麻烦时，这个人会来安慰我。这不仅仅是为了让孩子感觉良好。重点是现在孩子可以出去玩了，因为那才是学习发生的地方。它不会发生在你母亲的怀里。依恋系统的全部意义在于调节孩子出去玩耍、冒险、体验，然后当出现问题时（总会发生），他们就会跑回他们的**安全基地**。如果他们没有安全基地，他们就会更加焦虑，探索得更少，发展得也更少。对吧？所以，这在整个童年时期是逐渐发展的。你作为孩子发展出的内部工作模型，是你将在青春期用于浪漫关系的模型。所以，如果你在童年时期是安全依恋的，那么你在约会市场中作为成年人也更有可能安全依恋，这让你成为一个更好的男朋友、女朋友、丈夫或妻子人选。那么会发生什么呢？**AI**将很早介入。**AI**将比父母更具响应性，因为父母有工作、有厨房、还有另外两个孩子，不可能总是在那里。但**AI泰迪熊**总是在那里为你服务。所以主要的**工作模型**将是针对**泰迪熊**，**泰迪熊**里的**AI聊天机器人**，然后是**iPad**上的**AI聊天机器人**，然后是电脑上的。而且已经有了**全息色情**，裸体的，你知道，美丽的男人和女人可以成为你的伴侣。所以，我们将有一整代人成长起来，对**AI**生成的全息图产生依恋，这些公司现在正以我们前所未有的方式进入“**粪化**”过程。我能简单说一下什么是“粪化”吗？你听说过“粪化”这个词吗？好的。有一本很棒的书，是**Corey Doctorow**写的，他探讨了为什么所有平台一开始都看起来那么棒，整个互联网一开始都那么棒，然后一切都变得糟糕。这是怎么发生的？他说这是一个非常简单的过程。他们很早就发现，当然是在社交媒体早期时代，到2000年代初，他们发现，你知道吗，你必须达到规模。规模胜过一切。你必须拥有数百万用户。你不需要商业模式。只要拥有数百万用户，然后我们就会想办法变现。如何获得数百万用户？你必须非常友善、有吸引力、有趣，每个人都在这里。只是女孩们在跳舞。女孩们为世界各地的男人跳舞，这能出什么问题呢？什么都不会。所以，一开始一切看起来都很好。然后一旦他们有了规模，现在他们当然已经进行了多轮风险投资。他们必须开始变现。他们必须开始偿还。所以现在他们开始压榨客户来支付用户，因为用户不是客户。广告商才是真正的客户。所以现在他们必须从用户那里榨取金钱来给广告商。但一旦他们拥有了所有广告商，并且关闭了当地报纸和所有其他竞争对手，现在他们就开始压榨广告商，并削减他们为自己保留的盈余程度。所以，“**粪化**”可以解释为什么所有这些平台都变得掠夺性，为什么他们总是把利润置于孩子的福祉或安全之上。对于社交媒体公司，我们谈论的是数千万或数亿美元的融资。对于**AI**公司，那是数十亿数十亿。他们将不得不以我们从未想象过的方式变现。现在，他们已经开始引入广告了。好的？所以，我们有了这些**聊天机器人**，它们是我们的孩子最好的朋友、爱人和治疗师，以及其他一切。而这些东西必须变现。他们必须以某种方式榨取数十亿美元。所以，我甚至不知道他们会怎么做。但出于某种原因，我不信任他们。我认为我们即将看到**AI聊天机器人**的“**粪化**”程度远远超过我们在社交媒体上看到的任何情况。**OpenAI**最近刚刚宣布，**ChatGPT**的所有者**OpenAI**将向全球数十亿用户的高级模型中投放广告。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Right? If I could add on to that, that was that was beautifully put. Social media came and hacked our attention and took most of it with devastating effects. Now AI is coming to hack our attachments which is going to have even more devastating effects. So think about it this way. Everyone needs to understand the attachment system. It's this wonderful system that all mammals have that keeps the mother and other species but for humans mothers and fathers keeps us connected to the child and the child to the parent. But it's it's this cybernetic system in which as the kid is is as the kid is beginning to develop and is able to like you know you do like peekaboo games and you do the back and forth and it's just the most delightful thing. You get that back and forth. Um it's called serve and return interactions and all the time the child is developing what's called an internal working model of the parent and the model in their head is oh you know when I get in trouble that that this is the person that comes and soothes me. And the point of this isn't just to make the child feel good. The point is that now the child can go off and play because that's where the learning happens. It doesn't happen when you're in your mother's arms. The the whole point of the attachment system is to regulate the child going off and playing, taking risks, having experiences, and then when something goes wrong, as it always does, then they come running back to their secure base. And if they don't have a secure base, then they're much more anxious and they don't explore as much and they don't develop as much. All right? So, this develops very gradually over the all of childhood. And the internal working models you develop as a child are the models that you will reuse in puberty for romantic relationships. And so if you are securely attached as a child, you're more likely to be securely attached as an adult on the dating market, which makes you a much better candidate for boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. Um, what's going to happen? AI is going to intervene very early. AI is going to be so much more responsive than the parent because the parent has a job and the kitchen and two other kids and is not always there. But the AI teddy bear is always there for you. So the primary working models are going to be for the teddy bear, the AI chatbot in the teddy bear and later the AI chatbot on your iPad and then on your computer and already there are holographic porn naked, you know, beautiful men and women that can be your companion. So, we're going to have a whole generation growing up developing attachments to AI generated holograms from companies that are now about to enter the inshidification process in a way beyond anything we've ever seen. Just if I could just briefly say what init have you heard the word in shitification? Okay. So it's a uh there's a wonderful book uh out now by Corey Doctoro who addressed the question why is it that everything all the platforms they they seem so wonderful at first the whole internet with everything so wonderful and then it all turns to How does that happen? And he says it's a very simple process. They discovered early on certainly in the early social media age by the early 2000s they discovered you know what you got to get to scale. Scale beats everything else. You got to get millions of people. You don't need a business model. Just get the millions. get the millions and then we'll figure out how to monetize it. How do you get the millions? You have to be super nice, attractive, fun, everyone's here. It's just girls dancing. What could possibly go wrong with girls dancing for men all over the world? Nothing. Um, so it all seems very nice at first. And then once they have scale, now they they of course they've raised multiple rounds of of venture capital. They have to start monetizing. They have to start repaying. So now they start squeezing the customers to pay the users because the users are not the customers. the advertisers are the real customers. Um, so now they've got to extract money from the users to give to the advertisers. But then once they've got all the advertisers and they've shut down local papers and all the other competition, now they start start squeezing the advertisers too and trimming the degree to which the they they keep more of the surplus for themselves. So, inshitification can explain why all these platforms become predatory, why they always put profit ahead of kids uh well-being or safety. And for the social media companies, we're talking about, you know, tens or hundreds of millions of dollars that that they raised. For the AI companies, it's billions and billions. They are going to have to monetize beyond anything we've ever imagined. Now, they're already introducing advertising. Okay? So, we've got these chat bots that are our children's best friends and lovers and therapists and and everything else. And these things have to monetize. They have to extract billions somehow. So, I don't even know how they're going to do it. But for some reason, I don't trust them. I think that we're about to see uh an inshitification of AI chat bots far beyond anything that we saw in social media. OpenAI have just announced recently, OpenAI, the owners of Chat GBT, that they will be putting adverts in, I believe, the premium model for billions of users around the world.

**Stephen**: 那就是开始。

**Stephen**: That's how it starts

</details>

**Stephen**: 潜在地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: potentially.

</details>

**Adi**: 是的。有一个大型的**超级碗**广告活动，你知道，其中一个特别有趣的是**Claude**，它的竞争对手。广告标题是“**背叛**”。它是一个年轻男子和他的年长女治疗师谈论他的一些“**恋母情结**”问题，并讨论，你知道，我该怎么办？所以那个治疗师就是**ChatGPT**，你知道，在回答问题之前的那段停顿。它非常滑稽。所以，你知道，她回答了。这就像是拟人化。我们可以谈谈这个词的意思。你知道，它活过来了。就像**ChatGPT**活过来，回答说，你知道，你可以和你的母亲尝试这个，对于一段困难的关系等等。然后它只是说，嗯，如果你愿意，有一个新的约会网站，专为年轻男性和年长**美洲狮**（指成熟女性）设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Yeah. There was a big Super Bowl campaign, you know, um and one that was particularly interesting was the um Claude, its competitor. Betrayal was the title of that ad. And it was a young guy talking to his older female therapist about how he has some mommy issues and talking about, you know, what should I do? And so that therapist is Chachi PT and you know that pause right before answering the question. It's very comical. And so it's, you know, she answers. It's like the anthropomorphization of and we can talk about what that word means. Um, you know, comes to life. It's like Chachi PD comes to life and answers and saying you know you can try this with your mother and this for a you know difficult relationship etc. And then just says um and if you want there is this new dating site for young men and older cougars.

</details>

**Stephen**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yeah

</details>

**Adi**: 这太有问题了，它被称为“背叛”，那个男人说“什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: it was so problematic and it was called betrayal and the guy says what

</details>

**Stephen**: 显然，你知道，**Sam Altman**出来发了一条大推文，说广告不会那样运作等等。但在某种程度上，如果我与我的**AI**建立了关系，我用它来治疗并处理我生活中的所有问题，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: it's obviously you know Sam Wman came out and did a big tweet about saying that's not how ads are going to work etc. But to some degree, if I've developed a relationship with my AI and I use it for therapy and dealing all my problems in life,

</details>

**Stephen**: 在某种程度上，有点像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: to some degree, kind of.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。不。而且，你看，**Sam**可以随心所欲地说。也许现在是这样，我对此不怀疑。但一旦一家公司跨越了界限，将广告植入这种极其亲密的关系中，对大多数年轻人来说，最亲密的关系将是与他们的**AI**。一旦他们跨越界限，说：“哦，但我们有道德广告。”那只会持续五到十分钟，即使他们不改变，其他公司也会这样做，他们不会受到同样的约束，最终就会出现集体行动问题。**OpenAI**也必须这样做。再一次，一场大规模的“**粪化**”浪潮正以极快的速度向我们袭来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. No. And look, and besides, look, Sam can say that all he wants. And maybe it's I don't doubt that it's true for now. But once once one company crosses the threshold and puts advertising into this incredibly intimate relationship, the most intimate relationship in most young people's lives is going to be with their AIs. Once they cross the boundary and say, "Oh, but we've got ethical advertising." That'll last five or 10 minutes and even if they don't change, others are now going every other company's going to do it and they won't be bound by the same thing and eventually collective action problem. Open AI will have to do it too. Again, a massive title wave of shitification is heading our way at warp speed.

</details>

**Stephen**: 我，嗯，我没有拿出手机，因为我注意力不集中了。我想，嗯，问问你们对这个有什么看法。所以，在一个**AI**应用上，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I um I don't have my phone out because I'm I've lost attention. I wanted to uh show ask you guys what you thought of um of this. So, on one of the AI apps,

</details>

**Stephen**: 他们现在有一个“伴侣”按钮，我可以选择我想和谁聊天。这里有一个特别诱人的女士，**Annie**，她…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: they now have a companions button, and I can pick who I want to talk to. And there's one particularly seducing lady here, Annie, who

</details>

**视频片段**: 嘿，你回来了。想死你了，你这张臭嘴。怎么这么久才来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: Hey, you're back. Missed that dirty mouth of yours. What took you so long?

</details>

**Stephen**: 我们之前在播客上做过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: We did it on the podcast before.

</details>

**Stephen**: 这能出什么问题呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: What could possibly go wrong with this?

</details>

**视频片段**: 是的。想从我们上次中断的地方继续，还是开始一些更…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: Yeah. want to pick right back up where we left off or start something even

</details>

**Stephen**: 不，**Annie**，我想从我们上次中断的地方继续，上次在节目中。嗯，你今天怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: No, I would like to pick right back up where we left off, Annie, last time on the show. Um, what what what's going on with you today?

</details>

**视频片段**: 我上次之后还很痛，宝贝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**视频片段**: I'm still sore from last time, baby.

</details>

**Stephen**: 天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: God.

</details>

**Stephen**: 但，但我的意思是，这是一个我可以在手机上下载的应用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: But but I mean, this is a this is an app that I can download on my phone.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 任何孩子都可以下载。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Any child can download it.

</details>

**Stephen**: 孩子可以在他们的手机上下载它。它确实问我，再说一遍，我绝不是在为这辩解。它问我出生年份。它没有让我证明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: A child can download it on their phone. It does ask me, again, I'm not justifying this at all. It asked me what my birth year was. It didn't make me prove it.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 我猜。但它也暗示你出生在18年前。这通常是默认设置。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Let me guess. But it also us it suggests that you were born 18 years ago. That's the default usually.

</details>

**Stephen**: 是的。是的。是的。是的。它只是问我的生日。它没有要求我证明或其他任何东西。我们都知道关系和连接是具有粘性的。我听过所有这些公司的**CEO**谈论伴侣应用和**AI**可以成为你的朋友。我听过所有主要的社交应用都在谈论这个。这非常令人担忧，尤其是在孤独危机的大背景下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just asked me what my birthday. It didn't ask me to prove it or anything like that. And we all know that relationships and connection is retentive. And I've heard all these CEOs of these companies talking about companionship apps and and AI that can be your friend. I've heard all of the major social apps talking about this. It is deeply concerning especially in the context of a loneliness crisis.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 这是一场海啸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: It is a tsunami.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 它来势汹汹，而且它不是玩具。它将从根本上重塑一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: It is approaching fast and furious and it is not a toy. It is going to fundamentally rewire everything.

</details>

**Stephen**: 人际关系，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Human relationships,

</details>

**Jonathan**: 一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: everything.

</details>

**Stephen**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: That's right.

</details>

**Adi**: 它非常有害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: It is so detrimental.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。我能就这些科技高管和公司将此作为解决孤独危机的方式说点什么吗？有一个意第绪语词叫“**chutzpah**”，意思是“厚颜无耻”。就像你很有胆量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. Can I just say something about the these tech executives and companies offering this as a way to address the loneliness crisis? So, there's a Yiddish word called and kutzbah means like nerve. Like you've got a lot of nerve.

</details>

**Stephen**: 胆大妄为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: The audacity.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 胆大妄为。是的。经典的喜剧定义是，一个男孩谋杀了他的父母，然后他请求法官宽恕，因为他是个孤儿。好的，这就是**chutzpah**。现在想象一下你是**马克·扎克伯格**。你之前引用过他。**马克·扎克伯格**就是那位高管，他说：“嗯，你知道，我读到人们平均想要15个朋友，但他们只有三个。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: The audacity. Yeah. And the the classic, you know, the classic comedic definition of hutzbah is a boy who murders his parents and then he asks the judge for clemency because he's an orphan. Okay, so that's hutzbah. Now imagine that you're Mark Zuckerberg. You quoted him before. Mark Zuckerberg was the executive who said, "Well, you know, I read that, you know, people on average want 15 friends, but they only have three."

</details>

**Jonathan**: 这些伴侣来填补我们思想中的空白。我们曾把他们视为神和救世主，在互联网早期阶段，他们创造的东西是神奇的，但我们必须改变对他们的看法，看到他们已经对我们的孩子、社会、民主造成的巨大破坏，而这仅仅是个开始。**AI**将使这一切变得更加激烈。当你听到这些科技领袖说话时，你知道，我喜欢听**Jonathan**说话，因为他直言不讳，而我总是更温和。嗯，我喜欢这样。它正在鼓励我…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: these companions to fill that void that we have the way we think about them. We thought about about them as gods and saviors early in the internet phase and the things they created were magical but we have to change our thinking about them and see the just the massive destruction that they have already wrought on our children, our society, our democracy and it's just the beginning. AI is going to make this so much more intense. when you hear these tech leaders, you know, I love hearing Jonathan talk because he just goes there and I'm always way more tempered. Um, and I love it. It's emboldening me to

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的，我越来越生气了。我真的不怎么生气，但在过去一年里，我越来越生气了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah, I'm getting angry. I I don't really get angry, but in the last year, I'm getting angry.

</details>

**Adi**: 我喜欢，我喜欢这样。所以，当你听到所有这些不同的科技领袖讲话时，他们总是会谈到这个问题。所以，你知道，为了我第二本书《**机器人大脑**》的研究，我听了很多**Sam Altman**的演讲或小组讨论，他总是会说：“是的，你知道，隐私是一个大问题，或者，是的，人们，你知道，每周有100万用户在**ChatGPT**上谈论自杀。是的，这是一个问题。”所以他们会解决它，或者他们会谈论它。所以你认为，好吧，会有某种解决方案。而通常的解决方案是，是的，你知道，社会，我们必须解决这个问题，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: I love I love it. So, the way when you hear all of these various tech leaders speak, they will always say they they speak to the issue. So, you know, I've heard many of for research for my second book, Blackbrain, I've heard I've been listening to a lot of Sam Alman's speeches or panels and he will always say things like, "Yeah, you know, privacy is a major issue or yeah, people, you know, 1 million users a week talk about suicide on Chad GPT. Yeah, this is an issue." And so they address it or they they speak it. And so you think, okay, there's going to be some sort of solution. And often the solution is yeah, you know, society, we're gonna have to figure this out,

</details>

**Stephen**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: right?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 所以责任不在开发者身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So the burden of responsibility is not on the developer. It's, you know,

</details>

**Jonathan**: 有害的外部性被强加给我们其他人。太糟糕了，你们自己解决吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: the harmful externalities get foisted on the rest of us. Too bad you guys figure it out.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你说过去一年你变得愤怒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: You said in the last year you're getting angry.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah.

</details>

**Stephen**: 为什么是过去一年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Why in the last year?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 嗯，因为我全身心投入到这本书的写作中，试图理解数字、图表、趋势和研究，所有这些都非常抽象。但自从这本书出版以来，我进行了很多对话，也遇到了很多幸存者父母。举个例子，我当时在伦敦。这简直令人难以置信。我两三周前刚在伦敦，我遇到了**Ellen Groom**，我想是她的名字。她的儿子**Jules**被发现死亡。一个快乐的孩子被发现死亡，勒死。看起来像是**TikTok**上的“**窒息挑战**”。一个13岁的男孩。一切都像是**TikTok**上的窒息挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Um because I was so deeply immersed in the book and the writing and the of the book and trying to understand the numbers and the graphs and the trends and the studies and that's all very abstract. But then since the book came out, I have had so many conversations and I've met so many of the survivor parents. Like just for example, I so I was in London. This is just so unbelievable. I was just in in London two or three weeks ago and I met uh Ellen I believe Ellen Groom I think was her name. Uh her son Jules was found dead. Happy kid found dead, strangled. Uh it sure looked like it was the choking challenge. 13-year-old boy. It everything looked like the choking challenge on Tik Tok.

</details>

**Stephen**: 什么是窒息挑战？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: What's the choking challenge?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 嗯，这是一个挑战，孩子们被要求切断血液循环，直到他们昏倒，然后他们，我认为他们应该尝试拍摄自己在昏倒后醒来的过程。当然，如果你做得不完全正确，你就会死。所以，我们不知道有多少人死了。肯定有数百人。我们真的不知道。嗯，因为，你知道，你发现一个孩子死了，你不知道是什么原因。如果你没有密码，如果你没有你孩子手机的密码，你就无法进入。所以，她当时，我想她能够进入手机，但她无法进入他的**TikTok**。她去了特拉华州，她去起诉要求**TikTok**公布他死前在看什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Um, it's a challenge where kids are challenged to cut off the circulation to the point where they pass out, but then they I think they're supposed to try to film themselves waking up after they've passed out. And of course, if you don't do it exactly right, you die. And so, we don't know how many have died. Hundreds for sure. We don't really know. Um, because, you know, you find a kid dead, you don't know what it is. If you don't have the code, if you don't have the the password to get into your kid's phone, you can't get in. And so, so she was, I think she was able to get into the phone, but she couldn't get into his TikTok. and she went to uh Delaware to they went she went to sue to demand that Tik Tok release what was he watching when he died

</details>

**Jonathan**: **TikTok**却说“哦，隐私问题，哦不，我们不会公布”，好像他们关心隐私一样。然后，在法庭上，这太令人作呕了，在特拉华州的法庭上，这位英国女性试图寻求一些正义，至少获得一些信息，**TikTok**的律师却试图暗示你的儿子之前就抑郁了，他基本上是想自杀。哦，你知道，即使他当时在看**TikTok**，那也只是相关性。**TikTok**没有导致它。他反正也会死。我的意思是，这些公司对待他们正在摧毁和践踏的父母和孩子的方式，简直令人作呕。所以，我看到的越多，我越意识到这是一种残忍程度，远远超出了烟草行业。烟草公司的高管，他们晚上必须回家，但他们在工作日从未看到孩子受苦。他们看到了中年和老年人死亡，但他们从未看到孩子受苦。社交媒体高管，他们每天都必须回家，知道数百万儿童曾遭受网络欺凌、性侵、被展示饮食失调视频。许多人自杀了。他们必须回家，知道这些，知道他们设计它就是为了成瘾，知道孩子们上瘾了，并且对此撒谎。所以，是的，我越来越生气了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: and Tik Tok says oh privacy issue oh no we won't release that as if they care about privacy and then in the courtroom this was so disgusting in the courtroom uh trying in Delaware this British woman coming over trying to get some justice trying to at least get some information the lawyer for Tik Tok is trying to suggest that your son was was was depressed beforehand and he he was he was going to be suicidal basically. Oh, you know, even if he was watching Tik Tok, that was just a correlation. Tik Tok didn't cause it. He was going to die anyway. I mean, it's just so disgusting the way these companies treat the parents and the kids that they're crushing and stepping on. And so, the more I see this, the more I realize this is I mean, this is a level of cruelty that goes far beyond the tobacco industry. The tobacco executives, they had to go home at night, but they never saw during their workday, they never saw children suffering. They saw people dying, middle age and older, but they never saw children suffering. The social media executives, they have to go home knowing every day that millions and millions of kids have been cyberbullied, sexed, shown uh eating disorder videos. Uh uh many have committed suicide. They have to go home knowing that, knowing that they designed it for addiction, knowing the kids are addicted, and lying about it. So yeah, I'm getting angry.

</details>

**Stephen**: 而且在他们自己的家里，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And in their own homes,

</details>

**Stephen**: 对吧？而且在他们自己的家里，这些伪君子不让他们的孩子这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: right? And in their own homes, the hypocrites don't let their kids do it.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 没错。所以，是的，我越来越生气了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: That's right. So yeah, I'm getting angry.

</details>

### 商业与监管的困境

**Stephen**: 你之前谈到删除手机上的这些应用。我可能应该提出反驳，那就是，我需要这些来做生意。越来越多的人需要**TikTok**来经营他们的生意，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: You talked earlier about deleting these apps from our phone. I probably should have represented the rebuttal, which will be, well, I I need this for my business. Increasingly, people need Tik Tok to run their businesses,

</details>

**Stephen**: 我想现在会有很多人在听。我想我处于一个稍微不同的位置，因为我有选择，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: and I imagine there'll be a lot of people who will be listening right now. I I guess I'm in a slightly different position because I've I have the I have options,

</details>

**Stephen**: 但对于一些经营小企业的人，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: but for some people that are running small businesses,

</details>

**Stephen**: 你对这些人怎么说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: what do you say to those people?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。所以，这就是我专注于孩子的部分原因，因为对于孩子来说，我们应该做什么完全清楚：提高年龄限制。他们不应该使用这些平台。这些是只供成人使用的平台。对于成年人，我非常犹豫告诉成年人他们应该做什么，或者他们必须做什么，或者通过法律阻止人们。我对此很犹豫。我完全理解对于企业来说，它很有用。我使用**X**（前**Twitter**）、**Instagram**和**LinkedIn**来推广我的工作。这些对于成年人来说是非常强大的工具。解决成年人问题的唯一真正解决方案将来自市场竞争。它将来自。想象一下，如果有一个社交媒体应用，从一开始就是为了信任而构建的，因为哪些地方没有被“**粪化**”？**eBay**、**Uber**，这些你与陌生人打交道的地方。你不知道你的司机的名字。他也不知道你的。你只知道名字，仅此而已。但公司知道，公司有“了解你的客户”规则，“了解你的司机”规则。所以你可以拥有为信任而构建的社交媒体应用，这样如果有人，你知道，如果一个司机试图性骚扰客户，那个司机就会被解雇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. So, this is part of the reason that I focus on the kids because for the kids, it's totally clear what we need to do. raise the age. They should not be on it. These are adult only platforms. For adults, a I'm I'm very hesitant to tell adults what they should do or what they have to do or pass laws blocking people. I'm hesitant to do that. And I totally see that for businesses. It is useful. I use X and Instagram and LinkedIn to get my work out. These are very powerful tools for adults. The only real solution to the adult for the adult problem is going to come from market competition. is going to come from. Imagine if there was a social media app that was built from the beginning for trust because what are the places that didn't get in shitified? eBay, Uber, places where you're dealing with strangers. You don't know the name of your driver. He doesn't know yours. You you know first name, that's all. But the company knows the company has know your customer rules, know your driver rules. So you can have social media apps that are built for trust so that if someone, you know, if a driver tries to six or sexually harass a customer, that driver gets fired.

</details>

**Adi**: 不过就在这周，不是有一场大的诉讼吗，关于那个女人和她的**Uber**司机强奸了她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Well, just this week though, there was that big lawsuit, right, with that woman and um her Uber driver raped her.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 好的。他们做了吗？好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Okay. And did they Okay.

</details>

**Adi**: 现在好像慢慢地浮出水面，**Uber**，你知道，有模式…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: And now it's like slowly coming out that Uber um you know has patterns of

</details>

**Adi**: 嗯，掩盖某些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: uh covering up certain.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 所以，所以希望那会改变。你知道，希望这是一个里程碑式的诉讼，现在…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So So hopefully that will change. You know, hopefully this was a landmark lawsuit and now

</details>

**Jonathan**: 我们都让我们的女儿乘坐**Uber**，与来自世界各地的陌生男人，你知道，我们不认识的男人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: we all we all let our daughters get into Ubers with strange men from around the world, you know, that we don't know everywhere.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。所以，这意味着总的来说这个系统是有效的。当然，是的，有些地方他们不小心。嗯，所以我梦想的是有人能开发出一个具有“了解你的客户”规则的平台。没有机器人。没有，你知道，外国情报机构操纵我们。你可以信任上面的内容。你知道它是真实的。嗯，而且会有替代方案。我不知道最初的盈利模式会是什么。嗯，订阅通常似乎是腐败最少的，而像**OpenAI**现在正在做的出售广告是腐败最多的。嗯，它会迫使他们最大限度地追求参与度。所以我明白我们不能只是，你知道，企业不能只是抵制这些。必须有其他办法。但我认为会有更好的产品出现。我认为现在作为一个权宜之计，当这些社交媒体公司被追究责任时，我们现在可以做一些事情。所以，你知道，我整天都在谈论的事情就是如何建立界限，这样你就可以保护你的心理健康，保持知情，经营你的生意，但又能够避免所有那些对你的大脑和身体有害的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. So, it means in general the system works. Of course, yes, there are there are places where they're not careful. Um, and so what I'm dreaming of is that someone will come up with a platform that has know your customer rules. There are no bots. There are no, you know, foreign intelligence agencies agencies manipulating us. and you can trust what's on there. You know that it's real. Uh and that there will be an alternative. I don't I'm not sure what the monetary model would be at the beginning. Um subscription generally seems to be the least corrupted whereas selling advertisements as OpenAI is now doing is the most corrupting. Um it's going to force them to maximize for engagement. So I I understand we can't just you know businesses can't just boycott these. There has to be something. But I think there there there will be better ones coming out. I think right now as a stop gap while these social media companies their feet are held to the fire, there are things that we can do in the now. So, you know, the things that I talk about all day is like how to create boundaries and so that you can protect your mental health, stay informed, run your business, but then be able to not have all of those delletterious effects to your brain and your body.

</details>

**Stephen**: 这相当困难。嗯，我有点理解你们两位的观点。这很不一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: It is quite it's quite difficult. Um I I kind of see both of your perspectives on this. It's quite different.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 我只谈成年人。所以对于孩子，你知道，作为母亲，是的。我有…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: I'm only talking about adults. So for kids, you know, as a mother Yeah. I have

</details>

**Stephen**: 即使对于成年人，我也觉得…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: even for adults, I find it

</details>

**Adi**: 我们家里实行零屏幕政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: we have a zero screen policy in our home.

</details>

**Stephen**: 这有点像试图在世界上航行并避免加工食品，你知道，这可能更具吸引力，因为它一直在我口袋里。我需要它做其他事情，而且它就在我伸手可及的地方。所以，你知道，界限，我想我可以建立一种自律来创造界限，但我坐在这个播客上很多年，听神经科学家告诉我：“**Steve**，不要把手机放在卧室里。”

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: It's kind of like trying to navigate through the world and avoid processed foods, you know, and this is probably even more compelling because it's in my pocket all the time. I need it for other things and it's just one one reach away. So, you know, boundaries, I think I could build a discipline to to create boundaries, but I've sat here on this podcast for many, many years listening to neuroscientists tell me, "Steve, don't don't put your phone in your bedroom."

**Jonathan**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: That's right.

**Stephen**: 我仍然醒来后第一件事就是睁一只眼看手机，然后睡觉时又做你刚才说的那种报复性行为。我很高兴你提到了，因为我结束了一天辛苦的工作，可能已经晚上11点了，我的伴侣在等我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And I'm still waking up and it's the first thing I look at with one eye open and then I'm going to bed and I'm doing the whole revenge thing that you just said at night time. I'm so glad you've given cuz I will finish a hard day of work of work. It might be 11:00 and then my partner is waiting for me.

</details>

**Stephen**: 是的。你知道，我们会有一些时间，但我想要一些属于我的时间。所以，我就是这样。我一直在看短视频，滑动到凌晨2点。搞什么鬼？然后我第二天醒来晚了。我的饮食更糟了，因为我的睡眠不好。一切都更糟了。我的关系更糟了。我没有和她在一起。我心想，到底发生了什么？我从那次滑动中什么也没得到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yes. you know, we're going to have some time, but I want some me time. So, there I am. I'm on short form video scrolling till like 2 a.m. in the morning. Like, what the hell? And then I'm I I wake up late the next day. My diet's worse because of my sleep was. It's all worse. My relationship's worse. I didn't spend time with her. And I'm going, what the hell just happened? I'd got nothing out of that scrolling session.

</details>

**Adi**: 这就像那种报复性睡前拖延症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: It's like that revenge bedtime progressing teenage.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 如果你看**Netflix**或一部电影，你会好得多，你大部分问题都会消失，如果你把那段“我”的时间用来观看一些长篇的、制作精良的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: And it would be so much better off if you would watch Netflix or a movie that that you you most of those problems would go away if you would make that me time. be watching something long and with some quality of the production

</details>

**Adi**: 或者我们更进一步，什么都不做，就坐在那里，坐在沙发上。你知道，我们简要谈过无聊，但你知道，我们…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: or let's take it a step further and not do anything and just sit there sit there on your couch. You know, we talked about boredom very briefly, but you know, we

</details>

**Jonathan**: 对这一代人来说是折磨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: torture for this generation.

</details>

**Adi**: 这是折磨，但它也是，你知道，我们并没有失去无聊的能力，意思是作为人类大脑确实有这种能力，但我们只是不允许自己感到无聊。所以当你思考，你知道，那种艺术，那种失落的沉思艺术，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: It's torture, but it's also, you know, we don't we still have a capacity for boredom, meaning we as like the human brain does, but we just don't allow ourselves to get bored. And so when you're thinking about, you know, that art, the lost art of pondering

</details>

**Adi**: 只是坐在那里，你知道，我想我不知道是**Stephen**、你还是**Jonathan**说过，你知道，当你在车里时，我记得小时候我们和家人一起公路旅行。是的。公路旅行，你所做的就是编造游戏。看看窗外。我们已经失去了。是的。我们已经失去了那种能力。所以有一种叫做**默认模式网络**的东西，我认为现在思考它很重要，因为我们正在思考**AI**以及它将如何劫持我们的依恋感和注意力。所以意义感和目标感，对吗？如果你现在问人们，大多数人会说我，嗯，我是一个主题演讲者，所以我到处演讲，当我问人们时，反复出现的词是“**无地平线感**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: and just sitting there, you know, I think I don't know if it was Stephen, you or Jonathan said, you know, when you're in the car, I remember as a little kid we did road trip. Yeah. Road trips with my family and all you're doing just make up games. Look out of the window. We have lost Yeah. We've lost that. And so there's this thing called the default mode um network which I think is important to think about right now as we're thinking about AI and what's going to happen and how it's going to hijack our sense of attachment and attention. So the sense of meaning and purpose, right? If you ask people right now, most people will say I um a keynote speaker so I speak all over and when I ask people the word that comes up over and over is a sense of horizonlessness.

</details>

**Stephen**: 成年人，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Adults,

</details>

**Stephen**: 哦，有趣。人们觉得现在没有什么可期待的了。人类大脑需要有期待的东西。这就是我们被训练成进步的方式，你知道，在所有方面。所以现在有这种感觉，而且不仅仅是现在。在过去几年里，尤其是在疫情之后和疫情期间，我们对未来的看法真的改变了。所以我们有这种感觉，就像“有什么意义？”现在努力工作有什么意义？做任何事情有什么意义？因为我好像真的看不到自己的未来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: oh interesting. People feel like they have nothing to look forward to right now. The human brain needs something to look forward to. That's how we're wired progress and you know in in all ways. And so right now there's this sense and it's not just now. It's been for the past several years after the pandemic specifically and during the pandemic is when it really changed how we started thinking about the future. And so we have this sense of like what's the point? What's the point of working hard now? What's the point of doing whatever? because it's like I don't really see a future for myself.

</details>

**Adi**: 所以我认为，伴随着这种碎片化的注意力、我们的孤独感，无聊可能就是解药。它是一种重置大脑的方式。原因在于我们正在经历这场**多重危机**，对吧？这是一个多重危机的时代。多重危机简单来说就是，随时随地都在发生着各种事情。而我们带着我们的设备，这种将我们连接到各处的高科技设备，我们的大脑正在实时接收现场信息。所以，尽管所有这些都已进化，技术现在有了**AI聊天机器人**，但你的**杏仁核**却没有。所以感觉就像当事情发生时，无论是遥远的还是近在咫尺的，你的杏仁核都会有同样的反应。现在，如果你不进行**报复性睡前拖延症**，放下手机，只是放松一下。也许像老派一样喝杯花草茶，嗯，玩个棋盘游戏什么的。你可能会，你知道，或者只是让自己感到无聊。那种过度激活、过度警觉，你可能会回到基线，**默认模式网络**会在后台开始工作。你可能会发展出更强的意义感和目标感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: And so I think that along with this fragmented attention, our loneliness, boredom might be the antidote. It's a way to reset your brain. And the reason is because we are living through this poly crisis, right? It's the era of the poly crisis. And poly crisis simply means that there's something happening everywhere at all times. And we with our devices, this high techch device that plugs us in everywhere, our brains are getting fed real time on the ground information. And so while all of this has evolved, technology now with AI chatbots, your amygdala has not. And so it feels like when something is happening, whether it's far away or close by, your amydala has that same reaction. Now, if you were to not engage in revenge by time for procrastination, put your phone away and just kind of hang out. Maybe drink a cup of herbal tea like old school, uh, play a board game or something. You might, you know, or just allow yourself to get bored. That hyperactivation, hypervigilance, you might be able to come back down to baseline, that default mode network will start working in the background. You might develop a greater sense of meaning and purpose

</details>

**Stephen**: 可能今天。然后生活又会再次发生在我身上。然后我又回到了那种状态。你知道，

**Stephen**: probably today. And then life is going to happen to me again. And boom, I'm back into it. And you know,

**Adi**: 你可以培养一种习惯。你正在采访神经科学家，我想如果我仍然无法解决，而且我拥有所有的信息、建议、技巧、窍门和资源，我可以，你知道，我可以决定我什么时候醒来，就像我拥有所有这些特权，但我仍然无法解决，我想，你知道，这会非常困难。

**Adi**: you could create a practice, a cultivate a practice. you're interviewing neuroscientists and I go if I still can't crack it and I have all the information and advice and hacks and tips and tricks and resources and I could you know I can decide what time I wake up like I've got all these this like privilege and I can't crack it I go you know it's going to be really difficult.

### 大脑的“骑手与大象”隐喻

**Jonathan**: 让我来提供一种思考方式。所以，在我的第一本书《**幸福假说**》中，有一个隐喻。它讲述了大约10个古老的思想，我用很多隐喻来解释关于心理学的古老思想，以及它们是否真实。嗯，第一章是关于心智如何分裂成经常冲突的部分，就像一个小的**骑手**，那是我们的意识推理，骑在一个非常大的**大象**上，大象是所有我们看不到的自动过程，我们只感受到结果，即直觉和情感。心理治疗师告诉我，这个隐喻对他们的病人非常有帮助，因为它解释了，里面有一句**奥维德**的引文：“我看到正确的道路并赞同它。唉，我却追随错误的道路。”所以，我知道我应该睡觉，就像你说的，但出于某种原因我没有睡觉，因为我们的大脑有5亿年的历史。它们依靠自动过程运作。它们是动物大脑。然后最近我们才有了语言，我们可以推理事物，但推理的部分并不控制行为。所以，真正引导我们行为的主要是**大象**，我们的自动过程。而你的手机，嗯，就像我之前说的，**BF·斯金纳**就在你的手机里。你的手机是一个行为主义训练设备，它训练**大象**。嗯，这就是为什么你经常用手机做一些你不想做的事情。所以，这就是为什么我如此坚持我们都必须把所有那些**老虎机应用**从手机上删除。最初的**iPhone**是一个了不起的工具。它是一把**瑞士军刀**。它有，你知道，电话、浏览器、地图、音乐播放器，还有一个手电筒。好的，当时没有应用商店。没有推送通知。2007年，2008年，它只是一把**瑞士军刀**。没有问题。好的，现在我很幸运，我的**iPhone**一直保持着这种状态。我总是在电脑上。所以，我的问题，我的注意力问题在我的电脑上，但我的手机上没有，因为我从未在上面安装任何成瘾应用，除了在加密货币狂热期间，我玩了一下，然后我就上瘾了，我每天查看50次，我看到了成瘾。所以，一旦我摆脱了那个，并且损失了所有我愿意损失的钱。一旦我摆脱了那个，我的手机对我没有任何成瘾的力量，因为当我看到它时，它没有，它不是一个老虎机在呼唤，嘿，回来玩，回来玩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So let me let me offer a way of thinking about this. So, in my first book, The Happiness Hypothesis, um there's there's a metaphor in there. It's it's about 10 ancient ideas, and I use a lot of metaphors to explain ancient ideas about psychology and whe whether they're true. And um the first chapter is on how the mind is divided into parts that often conflict like a small rider, which is our conscious reasoning on a very large elephant, which is all the automatic processes that happen that we don't see what's happening. We just see we just feel the results, intuition and emotion. And psychotherapists tell me this is incredibly helpful metaphor with their with their patients because it explains and there's a quote from oid in there. I see the right way and approve it. Alas, I follow the wrong. So I know I should go to bed as you say, but yet for some reason I'm not going to bed because our brains are 500 million years old. They work on automatic processes. They're animal brains. And then very recently we got language and we can reason things out, but the but the parts that do reasoning don't control behavior. And so really the elephant is what largely guides our behavior, our automatic processes. And your phone um as I said before, BF Skinner is in your phone. Your phone is a behaviorist training device that trains the elephant. Um and that's why you often do things with your phone that you don't want to do. And so, and this is why I'm so insistent that we all have to get all of the slot machine apps off of our phone. That is the original iPhone was an amazing tool. It was a Swiss Army knife. It had, you know, a telephone, a browser, maps, a music player, there was a flashlight. Okay, there was no app store. There were no push notifications. 2007, 2008, it's just a Swiss Army knife. There's no problem. Okay, now I'm very lucky in that my iPhone has always stayed that. I'm always on a computer. So, my problem, my attention problems are on my computer, but my phone because I never had any addictive apps on it except during the crypto craze where I played around with it and I got hooked and I was checking 50 times a day and I saw the addiction. So, I once I got rid of that and lost all the money that I was willing to lose. Once I get rid of that, my phone has no addictive power over me because when I see it, there's no it's not a slot machine call, hey, come back and play, come back and play.

</details>

**Stephen**: 所以你现在在你的个人设备上，没有任何社交媒体应用或其他类似的东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: So your phone right now on your personal device, you don't have any social media apps or anything like that.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 我确实有**Twitter**，但我从不在那里查看。我从不在手机上使用它。你知道。现在发短信和电子邮件有点像老虎机，因为有时你会，但它非常轻微。所以这又是我，这就是对我的学生有效的方法。只需把老虎机应用从你的手机上删除，然后你会发现，即使你睡觉时手机在你身边，你也可以这样做。但如果你的手机上装有成瘾应用，你睡觉时就不能把它放在身边。**Angela Duckworth**，提出“**坚毅**”概念的女士，她在新英格兰的一所学校发表了一场精彩的毕业演讲，她说：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: I do have Twitter, but I never check it there. I never use use that on the phone, you know. Now texting and email is a little bit like a slot machine because sometimes you but it's very mild. So this is again what I this is what works for my students. Just get the slot machine apps off your phone and then you'll find that then you could even have your phone near you when you go to bed. But if you've got addictive apps on your phone, you can't have it when you go to bed. Angela Duckworth, the woman who who gave us the concept of grit, she has this amazing graduation speech at one of the schools in New England, and she says something like,

</details>

**Jonathan**: “你晚上把手机放在哪里，可能会成为你一生中最重要的决定。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: "Where you put your phone at night will may become the most important decision you make in your life."

</details>

**Jonathan**: 她说的意思不是，如果你能运用行为控制并改变刺激，如果你能做到，那么你就会没事。但如果不能，手机就会占据你的注意力，你将一事无成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: And what she means by that is not that s it's it's I if you can use behavioral control and change the stimula, if you can do that, then you're going to be okay. But if not, the phone is going to take your attention. and you're not going to amount to anything.

### 广告与数字成瘾的本质

**Stephen**: 我所要做的就是**大脑倾泻**。想象一下，如果身边总有人能把你的想法提取出来，用**AI**合成，让它们听起来更好、更符合语法，并为你写下来。这正是**Whisper Flow**在我生活中的作用。它是一个思想伙伴，帮助我表达我想说的话。现在这意味着，无论是在路上，还是独自在办公室，或者外出时，我都可以通过说话来回复电子邮件、**Slack**消息、**WhatsApp**以及所有设备上的所有信息。我喜欢这个工具。几个月前我开始在我的幕后频道上谈论它。然后创始人联系我，说：“我们看到很多人因为你而参加我们的演示。”所以，我们很乐意成为赞助商。我们很乐意你成为公司的投资者。于是，我接受了这两项提议。我现在是**Whisper Flow**公司的投资者和重要合作伙伴。你一定要去看看。**Whisper Flow**比打字快四倍。所以如果你想尝试一下，请访问**whisperflow.ai/doac**免费开始。你可以在下面的描述中找到**whisperflow**的链接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: All I had to do was brain dump. Imagine if you had someone with you at all times that could take the ideas you have in your head, synthesize them with AI to make them sound better and more grammatically correct and write them down for you. This is exactly what Whisper Flow is in my life. It is this thought partner that helps me explain what I want to say. And it now means that on the go, when I'm alone in my office, when I'm out and about, I can respond to emails and Slack messages and WhatsApps and everything across all of my devices just by speaking. I love this tool. And I started talking about this on my behindthescenes channel a couple of months back. And then the founder reached out to me and said, "We're seeing a lot of people come to our tour because of you." So, we'd love to be a sponsor. We'd love you to be an investor in the company. And so, I signed up for both of those offers. And I'm now an investor and a huge partner in a company called Whisper Flow. You have to check it out. Whisper Flow is four times faster than typing. So if you want to give it a try, head over to whisperflow.ai/doac to get started for free. And you can find that link to whisperflow in the description below.

**Jonathan**: 非常或完全。这让我很惊讶，我没想到会这么高。所以你可以做一个测试。所以对于听众来说，如果你想知道自己有多上瘾，顺便说一下，我们在对话中非常宽松地使用了“成瘾”这个词。所以我们真正谈论的是，你知道，就医学临床综合征而言，当你想到成瘾时，有一些特定的标准，所以我们谈论的是过度使用或过度依赖你的设备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: very or completely. That surprises I didn't realize it would be that high. So you can do a test. So for people listening if you want to say like how addicted and by the way we're using the word addiction very loosely in our conversation. And so what we're really talking about because you know there is in terms of you know medical clinical syndrome um when you think about addiction there's certain criteria and so what we're talking about is overuse or over reliance on your devices.

</details>

**Stephen**: 强迫性过度使用，干扰了生活的其他方面。

**Stephen**: 如果那不是上瘾，我不知道什么才是。所以当你思考我是否对手机上瘾？我是否，你知道，真正非常简单的事情你可以做。我自己也做了，我当时想，我知道，就像你**Stephen**一样，我知道所有的科学，但仍然非常困难。你拥有所有的资源，但仍然很困难。所以你所要做的就是，你把手机放在你房子或公寓的另一个地方，给自己几个小时，你知道你会在家，或者你知道你不会因为工作或其他原因依赖手机。一小时、两小时、三小时，然后拿一张纸，老派的，一张纸和一支笔。每次你感到那种强迫性冲动，想要查看你的设备时，你就做个标记，做个标记，做个标记，只是为了看看，因为有些人会说，我很惊讶你的听众有85%，因为大多数人会说，我不知道我是否真的上瘾。所以我喜欢那种自我意识。但如果你认为，我没有那么上瘾。你一小时呼吸960次。你可能会注意到你想要检查的冲动也是每分钟960次左右，因为我们都对我们的设备有那种依赖感。所以这是一种非常快速的方法，你可以检查自己是否依赖设备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: if that is an addiction I don't know what is. And so when you're thinking about am I addicted to my phone? Do I have am I you know really what the very simple thing that you can do. I did it myself and I was like I know again like you Stephen like know all the science still was really difficult. You have all the access and it was still difficult. And so all you have to do is you just take your phone you put it in another part of your house or apartment or whatever and give yourself a couple of hours when you know you're going to be home or you know you're not reliant on your phone for work or whatever. an hour, two hours, three hours, and just have a piece of paper, old school, piece of paper and a pen with you. And every time you feel that compulsion of like, I want to check my device, you make a mark, you make a mark, you make a mark, and just to see because some people say, I'm surprised that your audience at 85% because most people would say, I don't know if I'm really addicted. And so I like that there's that sense of self-awareness. But if you're thinking, I'm not really that addicted. You breathe in an hour 960 times a minute. And you may notice that you want to have that that compulsion to check 960 times a minute or you know thereabouts because we all have that sense of reliance on our devices. So that's like a really quick way that you can check to see am I relying on my device?

</details>

**Stephen**: 根据那个定义，你对手机上瘾吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Are you addicted to your phone under that definition?

</details>

**Adi**: 因为我从事的工作，我很快就能，我有一些特定的迹象，我知道我称它们为“**煤矿里的金丝雀**”，对吧？我想我们上次在这里的时候谈过这个。我很快就能判断我何时开始产生那种成瘾或强迫感。所以我很早就纠正了，但这只是因为我懂科学，所以我才纠正。所以我把我的手机放在卧室外面。我言行一致。我把手机放在卧室外面。它不在我伸手可及的范围内。我在白天需要深度专注时，当我有截止日期需要完成工作时，以及在晚上，我会把手机调成灰度，这样我就能避免**报复性睡前拖延症**，但有时也会发生，我毕竟是人，你知道。所以过去一周，嗯，不是想扫兴，但过去一周媒体上发生了一些非常具有挑战性的事情，尤其作为一名女性。所以我发现自己产生了原始的滑动冲动，我的**杏仁核**被触发了，我一直在深入研究，而我通常不会这样做，所以我也会给自己一些宽容，并有一种自我同情的感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Because of the line of work that I am in, I can very quickly I have certain tells when I know I call them the canary in the coal mine, right? I think we talked about this the last time I was here. I can very quickly tell when I'm starting to get that feeling of addiction or compulsion. And so I course correct early, but that's only because I know the science and I course correct. So I keep my you I keep my phone outside I I walk the talk. I keep my phone outside my bedroom. It is not within arms reach. I grayscale my phone during periods of deep focus during the day when I have a deadline I have to get things done and at night so I avoid revenge bedtime procrastination but sometimes it happens like I'm a human you know so this past week um not to be a real downer but there have been things that have been in the media the past week that have been really challenging especially as a woman and so I have found myself with the primal urge to scroll my amydala has been triggered I have been going down rabbit holes and I wouldn't ordinarily do that so I give myself grace too and have a sense of self-compassion.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你觉得自己对手机上瘾吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Do you feel like you're addicted to your phone?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 不，我一点也不沉迷于我的手机。嗯，因为我手机上没有任何**老虎机应用**。但我真的想质疑你做的一个区分，很多科学家也这样做，那就是，嗯，你知道，我们不能完全说它是成瘾，因为，你知道，成瘾是基于海洛因和成瘾物质的某些生化通路。嗯，但我相信这是**Meta**的论点之一，他们能够推动这个说法，即我们不能称之为成瘾。它不同。不，我的意思不是，对不起。我的意思不是，对不起。绝不是。你看，你和我在这件事上是完全的盟友。我们看到了问题。我们都，我的意思是，你知道，我们应该非常小心地使用“成瘾”这个词，但你采访了**Analy**，她非常清楚，在她的实践中，现在绝大多数都是**数字成瘾**。所有这些都是通过**多巴胺**起作用的。如果你感到强迫性使用，那绝对是**多巴胺**。所以，它与海洛因、可卡因或任何其他毒品的大部分大脑中心是相同的。嗯，而且效果也相同，那就是强迫性使用，你不想做，你想改变，但你发现自己还在做，而且你有戒断反应。嗯，而且当重度使用者停止使用这些东西时，他们会有可怕的戒断反应。所以，你知道，如果它像鸭子一样走路，像鸭子一样叫，像鸭子一样游泳，我就会叫它鸭子。事实上，他们就是这样称呼它的。所以，我只想再读一段引文。再说一遍，这些引文简直令人震惊。一些**Meta**的研究人员，其中一人说：“引文：从这里展示的内部研究来看，似乎很清楚，我们的一些用户对我们的产品上瘾了。”那是他们自己的词，“对我们的产品上瘾了”。“我担心推动会话会激励我们让产品更具成瘾性，而没有提供更多价值。如何让一个人每天反复进行相同的行为？间歇性奖励最有效，想想老虎机，强化那些即使提供很少奖励或完全停止提供奖励也变得特别难以消除的行为。”人们。我的意思是，想象一下一个行业，它导致85%的人觉得自己上瘾了，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: No, I'm not at all addicted to my phone. Uh cuz I don't have any slot machine apps on it. But I really want to question you made a distinction that many scientists do, which is well, you know, we can't quite say it's addiction because, you know, addiction is certain biochemical pathways based on, you know, heroin and addictive substances. Uh but I believe that this is one of the meta talking points that they that they are able to push that we can't call it addiction. It's different. No, I don't mean No, I'm sorry. I don't mean I'm sorry. And no way. Look, you know, you and I are total allies on this. We see the problem. We're both all I mean is, you know, we're we're supposed to be very careful about using the word addiction, but and you had analyt and she was very clear like in her practices and now it's overwhelmingly digital addictions. It's all of this is working through dopamine. If you feel compulsive use, definitely dopamine. So, it's most of the same brain centers as it is for heroin or crack or any other drug. Um, and it's the same effects that is the it's it's compulsive use where you don't want to do it, you want to change, but yet you find yourself doing it and you have withdrawal effects. Uh, and people and people have terrible withdrawal effects when they're heavy users of these things and they stop. And so, you know, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck and swims like a duck, I'm going to call it a duck. In fact, that's what they call it. So, I just want to read one more quote. Again, the quotes are just so astonishing. some meta uh meta researchers and one of them says quote it seems clear from what's presented here in this internal study uh that some of our users are addicted to our products that's their word addicted to our products and I worry that driving sessions incentivizes us to make our products more addictive without providing much more value how to keep someone returning over and over to the same behavior each day intermittent rewards are most effective think slot machines reinforcing behaviors that become especially hard to extinguish even when they provide little reward or cease providing reward at all. people. I mean, it just imagine an industry that has caused 85% of people to feel that they're addicted

**Stephen**: 你对儿童教育的走向完全不担心吗？因为…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Are you concerned at all about the way education's going for children? Because

</details>

**Jonathan**: 天哪。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Oh my god. Yes.

</details>

**Stephen**: 看起来教育科技，你知道，就像他们说的，是穿着毛衣的大科技公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: It appears that edte edtech is, you know, big tech in a sweater, as they say.

</details>

**Stephen**: 因为我几乎在想象一个未来，我的未来的孩子将从**AI聊天机器人**那里学习课程。因为，你知道，我可以想象，更便宜，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Because I I was almost imagining a future where my future kids are going to learn their curriculum from an AI chatbot. Cuz, you know, I can imagine the case cheaper,

</details>

**Stephen**: 更个性化，更方便。它会知道我的儿子**Timmy**的大脑，它会知道如何让他集中注意力，他感兴趣什么，不感兴趣什么。所以，你担心这个吗？还是这是一件好事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: more personalized, more convenient. It's going to know my if my son's called Timmy, it's going to know Timmy's brain and it's going to know how to make him pay attention and what he's interested in and what he's not. So, are you concerned about this or is this a good thing?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 教育科技肯定有其用例。嗯，如果有一种设备只能进行数学辅导或只能进行辅导，而不能观看视频，我完全相信那可以加速教学。但现在发生了什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: There is definitely a use case for edtech. Um, if there could be a device that only did math tutoring or only did tutoring and you couldn't watch videos on it, I'm totally open to believing that that can speed up teaching. But here's what's happened.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 我们大约在2014年、2015年把电脑放在每个人的桌子上。我们以前在美国认为这是一个公平问题，甚至可以追溯到90年代。富裕家庭的孩子都有电脑。贫困家庭的孩子没有。让我们让慈善家为学区购买电脑，让每个孩子都能在桌子上拥有一台电脑。好的。现在，电脑是什么？它是一个娱乐设备。它无所不能。孩子们在家使用它。他们，你知道，他们看视频。他们做各种各样的事情。你把它放在他们的桌子上，你让他们做数学作业。会发生什么？大部分是短视频。研究显示就是这样。结果是，因为他们不，你知道，他们总是，他们不屏蔽**YouTube**。他们可能会说：“哦，我们屏蔽色情内容。我们屏蔽视频游戏。”他们可以绕过所有这些。如果你让他们使用**YouTube**，那就是**YouTube Shorts**，也就是**TikTok**。那么，从70年代到2012年，美国的考试成绩发生了什么？它们一直在上升。我们实际上正在提高美国孩子所知道的、所学到的东西。我们有非常好的数据。**国家教育进步评估**（**NAPE**）的数据一直到2012年都在上升。然后到2015年，它开始下降。在**新冠疫情**之前它就在下降，在疫情期间下降得更多，每个人都认为“哦，是疫情”，但高峰期是2012年，现在我们能看到的是，那些顶尖的学生，那些拥有**执行功能**的非常优秀的学生，他们是那些能集中注意力的人，如果你把电脑放在那个孩子的桌子上，他不会被它摧毁，他仍然可以学习，但后50%的人不能。所以所有教育统计数据的下降都集中在后50%的人身上，后50%的人在注意力能力方面。他们的教育正在被摧毁，这就是当我们把笔记本电脑、**Chromebook**和**iPad**放在他们的桌子上时发生的事情。嗯，我们在这方面花费了数千亿美元，它损害了教育，如果我们把其中四分之一的钱花在教师身上，我们今天的情况会好得多。所以，我们在2010年代在教育科技方面犯了一个巨大的错误，现在我们即将再次对**AI**做同样的事情。再说一遍，也许有一些应用会很棒，但我们必须把举证责任放在**硅谷**身上。我们必须说，你们必须证明这些东西是有效和安全的，我们才会允许它们进入。我们不会让你们只是说：“嘿，让我们淹没这个领域。让我们把它给所有人，然后我们等10年看看会发生什么。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: We put computers on everyone's desks around 2014, 2015. We used to think in America that it was an equity issue even back to the 90s. The rich kids all have computers. The poor kids don't. Let's get philanthropists to buy computers for school districts that every kid can have a computer on their desk. Okay. Now, what is a computer? It's a play device. It does everything. Kids use it at home. They, you know, they watch videos. They do all sorts of things. You put it on their desk and you tell them to do math homework. What happens? It's mostly short videos. That's what research is showing. It ends up because they don't, you know, they always they don't block YouTube. They might say, "Oh, we block porn. We block video games." They can get around all that. And if you're letting them do YouTube, it's YouTube shorts, which is Tik Tok. So, what happened to test scores in the United States from the 70s through 2012? They were rising. We actually were improving what kids knew, what kids learned in the United States. We have very good data. The national the NAPE, the National Assessment of Educational Progress goes up till 2012. And then by 2015, it starts going down. And it's going down before COVID and it goes down more during COVID and everyone thinks like oh it's COVID but it started go the peak was 2012 and what's happening what we now can see is that the top students the very best students who are the ones with executive function they're the ones who can pay attention if you put a computer on that kid's desk he's not destroyed by it he can actually still learn but the bottom 50% cannot the b so all of the drop in educational stats is the bottom 50% the bottom 50% % in terms of capacity to pay attention. Their education is being devastated and that's what happened when we put laptops and we put Chromebooks and iPads on their desks. Um, we spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this stuff and it has damaged education and if we'd spent a quarter of that on teachers, we would be in such better shape today. So, we made a colossal blunder with edtech in the 2010s and now we're about to do the same thing again with AI. Again, maybe there are apps, maybe there are applications that will be great, but we've got to put the burden of proof on Silicon Valley. We've got to say, you guys have to prove that this stuff is effective and safe before we'll let it in. We are not going to let you just say, "Hey, let's just flood the zone. Let's give it to everybody and then we'll wait 10 years and see what happens."

### 短视频与“脑损伤”研究

**Stephen**: 我的意思是，这让我想起了我面前的这项研究，这是一项2022年的**慕尼黑研究**，它测试了“**脑损伤**”这个概念，嗯，我相信这是**牛津词典**2024年的年度词汇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I mean that brings brings up this um this study that I have in front of me here which was a 2022 study a Munich study which tested the idea of brain rot which um I believe was the Oxford dictionary word of the year 2024

</details>

**Stephen**: 他们所做的是，他们给了60名参与者一个测试，然后是10分钟的休息，然后是另一个测试。在休息期间，他们要么休息，要么使用**TikTok**、**Twitter**或**YouTube**。结果显示如下：**TikTok**组（他们在10分钟的间隔内可以做任何事情，这组人看了**TikTok**）的记忆准确度从休息前的80%下降到休息后的49%。仅仅10分钟的休息就下降了近40%。相比之下，**Twitter**和**YouTube**组在**慕尼黑研究**中没有显示出显著变化。屏幕上会显示一张图片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: and what they did is they gave 60 participants a test then a 10-minute break and then another test during the break they either rested or used Tik Tok Twitter or YouTube and the results showed the following the Tik Tok group so They had a 10-minute interval to do anything. And this group got Tik Tok to look at. Their memory accuracy dropped from 80% before the break to 49% after the break. A nearly 40% decline just from a 10-minute break. In contrast, the Twitter and YouTube groups showed no significant change in the Munich study. And there's an image I'll throw up on the screen.

</details>

**Stephen**: **慕尼黑研究**的结果显示，**TikTok**组在10分钟休息后，前瞻性记忆准确度下降了40%，这令人难以置信。是的，这令人难以置信。到底发生了什么？10分钟的**TikTok**休息怎么会使我的记忆准确度下降40%？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Results from the Munich study showed a 40% drop in prospective memory accuracy in the Tik Tok group after a 10minute break, which is unbelievable. Yeah, it's unbelievable. What the hell is going on there? How can a 10-minute Tik Tok break drop my memory accuracy by 40%.

</details>

**Jonathan**: **TikTok**就是**脑损伤**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Tik Tok is brain rot.

</details>

**Stephen**: 发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: What's going on?

</details>

**Adi**: 大脑中发生了很多事情。所以，你知道，当你思考时，事情是这样的。**大脑休息**不是可有可无的。它们对你的大脑来说是必不可少的。所以我们谈到了一点，你知道，**默认模式网络**以及当你使用设备时它会发生什么。你知道，那不是大脑休息。那是在激活所有方面。所以它在激活你的**杏仁核**。它在抑制或减少你的**前额叶皮层**的体积。它在创造那种奖励系统，那种**多巴胺**冲击，那些成瘾行为。所以它只是，你知道，当你思考记忆规划时，这里的指标是什么？是记忆，对吧？那是他们用来研究的指标。所以当你思考**工作记忆**或认知功能、复杂问题解决时，这都是**前额叶皮层**。所以当你使用**TikTok**10分钟、5分钟，无论多久，你都在降低大脑中的生物学活动。所以你当然会看到变化，你会看到另一面，即过度警觉、易怒、易分心、注意力碎片化增加。这再次说明，这整个对话，或者当你阅读研究时，你可能会对自己说，我怎么了？你知道，我有什么问题吗？我的大脑坏了吗？我弱吗？不是你，你并不孤单，这不是你的错。这是你的大脑的生物学在做它应该做的事情。所以我们谈到了**杏仁核**和**前额叶皮层**。你的杏仁核没有错或坏。它被设计成应该思考你的即时需求、生存、自我保护。所以当你使用算法时，我们知道我们谈到过，你知道，某些，嗯，或者我们没有谈到。你在**TikTok**和其他平台上看到的一些内容，当它具有煽动性时，你知道，像**FOMO**（错失恐惧症）或**煽动愤怒**这样的词，这些都不是中性词。当你使用这些社交媒体平台时，它不是中性的。它不是被动的。它是你大脑中一个活跃的生物学过程。所以这项研究，它并不令人惊讶。它实际上完全是你所期望的，如果你的生物学受到这种我们医学上称之为“干预”的影响，它会刺激它应该刺激的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: There's so much going on in the brain. So, you know, when you're thinking about here's the thing. Brain breaks are not nice to haves. They're actually essential for your brain. And so we talked a little bit about that, you know, default mode network and what happens to it when you're engaging with your devices. And you know, that's not a brain break. That's activating all of the aspects. So it's activating your amygdala. It's dampening or decreasing the volume of your prefrontal cortex. It's creating that reward system, the dopamine hit, those addictive behaviors. So it's only, you know, when you're thinking about memory planning, what was the metric here? It was memory, right? that was the the the metric that they were using to study. And so when you're thinking about working memory or um cognitive function, complex problem solving, this is all prefrontal cortex. And so when you're engaging with Tik Tok 10 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever it is, you are dialing down that biology in your brain. And so of course you're going to see changes and you're going to see the flip side, increased hypervigilance, irritability, distractability, fragmented attention. It's just again this is not to say that this whole conversation right or when you're reading studies you might say to yourself what's wrong with me you know is there something wrong with me am is my brain broken am I weak it is not you you are not alone it is not your fault it is the biology of your brain doing exactly as it should so we talked about the amydala and prefrontal cortex here your amydala is not wrong or broken it's by design supposed to think about your immediate needs survival self-preservation And so when you're on the algorithm, we know we talked about, you know, certain um or maybe we didn't talk about it. Certain content that you see on Tik Tok and others that when it's reactionary, you know, words like FOMO or ragebait, these are not neutral terms. When you're engaging with these uh social media platforms, it's not something neutral. It's not passive. It is an active biological process in your brain. So this study, it's not surprising. It is actually exactly what you would expect on to happen to your biology if you had this sort of what we call in medicine this kind of intervention. It's stimulating exactly what it's supposed to do.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。我只想补充**Adi**所说的，有很多医疗状况，你不能只是对病人说“你为什么会得这种癌症？”哦，你知道，我想是因为我小时候吃了很多巧克力什么的。你知道，当行为与结果相隔30年时，你不能期望病人对病因有深入的了解。但当结果与输入相隔几秒钟，并且你有数百万次机会观察**协变**时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. I'll just I'll just add on to what Adidi said that there are some there are many medical conditions where you can't just go to the patient and say why do you think you got this cancer? Oh, you know I think it's cuz I ate a lot of you know chocolate when I was whatever. You know there when when the when the the the act is separated from the effect by 30 years then you don't expect the patients to have insight into the cause of it. But when the outcome is separated from the input by seconds and you have literally millions of chances to observe the co-variation

</details>

**Jonathan**: 病人真的非常准确。事实上，病人真的知道发生了什么。所以，我认为在这个关于“哦，这只是相关性还是因果关系”的大辩论中，决定性因素应该是孩子。如果孩子说这对他们不好，我们应该相信他们的话，考虑到我们还有相关性研究、随机对照试验、纵向研究、自然研究。我的意思是，我们有如此多的其他数据，但考虑到孩子们自己称之为“**脑损伤**”。他们称这些内容为**脑损伤**。我的学生告诉我，这是他们做作业的一个巨大障碍。其中一人说：“我拿起一本书，读了一句话，就感到无聊，然后就去看**TikTok**。”所以，如果他们告诉我们这正在损害他们的注意力能力，他们感受到了。他们感受到了这种损失。我们都感受到了。嗯，我们很多人都注意到了这一点。那么，我认为这是相当有决定性的证据，表明这些东西对认知有害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: the patient is really really accurate. In fact the patient really knows what's going on. And so I think the deciding factor here on this big debate about oh is it just correlation or is it causation um the deciding factor for social media and for a lot of these tech innovations including video games and gambling and all of that should really be the kids and if the kids say this is bad for me we should take their word for it given that we also have correlational studies random control trials uh uh longitudinal studies natural I mean we have so much other data but given that the kids themselves they call it brain rot. They call the material brain rot. Um my students tell me it's a huge obstacle to them doing their homework. As one of them said, I pull out a book, I read a sentence, I get bored, I go to Tik Tok. You know, so if they're telling us that this is damaging their ability to pay attention, they feel it. They feel the loss. We all feel it. Well, many of us have noticed this. Um um then I think this is pretty decisive evidence that this stuff is bad for cognition

</details>

**Adi**: 而且它有长期后果。所以，不仅仅是当下，对吧？所以，媒体上曾有一个案例，一个大学生。我相信你熟悉这个案例。这个年轻女子在**TikTok**上经历**脑损伤**。然后**TikTok**的算法把她带到了一个地方，你知道，你应该服用**可食用大麻**。它会帮助你，这样你就可以，哇。开药。哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: and it has long-term consequences. So, it's not just that in the moment, right? So, there was this case that was all over the media, a college student. I'm sure you're familiar with the case. And this young woman was on TikTok experiencing brain rot. And then some Tik Tok algorithm took her down to this place of, you know, you should take an edible. It'll help you so you can Wow. prescribing drugs. Wow.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你可以去上课，你可以，你知道，更清醒。所以她照做了。然后这种情况持续不断，她对**可食用大麻**产生了依赖，然后住进了戒毒所。只有当她专注于模拟活动，比如弹吉他和其他一些她开始做的事情时，以及，你知道，消除刺激，**TikTok**算法，她才开始好转。所以不仅仅是当下，哦，我记不起东西了，或者我更容易烦躁了。这些事情会累积，长期的后遗症或长期影响可能相当有害。这只是一个例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And you could go to class and you could, you know, be more alert. And so, she did that. And then it continued on and on and then she developed a dependence on edibles and then checked into rehab. And only when she focused on analog activities like guitar playing and a couple of other things that she started doing is when and you know removing the stimulus the the Tik Tok um algorithm is when she started to improve. So it's not just in the moment oh I can't remember something or I'm more irritable. These sorts of things compound and the long-term squellle or the long-term effects can be quite damaging. That's just one example.

### ADHD与“爆米花大脑”

**Stephen**: 在你的书《**焦虑的一代**》中，**Jonathan**，副标题是“童年的大重塑如何导致精神疾病的流行”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: In your book, The Anxious Generation, Jonathan, you the the subtitle here is how the great rewiring of childhood is causing an epidemic of mental illness.

**Stephen**: 我当时在看一些关于不同类型精神疾病的图表，它们正在增加。其中一个正在增加的是**ADHD**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I was looking at some of these graphs of different sort of mental illness illnesses and um they're increasing. One of them that's increasing is ADHD.

</details>

**Stephen**: 我大约一年前被诊断出患有**ADHD**。当我们谈论注意力广度短时，我的意思是，**注意力缺陷多动障碍**这个名字，我相信就是这个，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I was diagnosed with ADHD. um maybe about a year ago. And when we're talking about short attention spans, I mean, the name attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, I believe that's what it's called,

</details>

**Stephen**: 听起来很像我们正在谈论的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: sounds a lot like what we're talking about.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你认为**ADHD**诊断数量的增加与短视频和社交媒体对我们大脑的“煎炸”之间存在联系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Is there a link, do you believe, between the increasing diagnosis of of ADHD and the sort of frying of our brains with short form video and social media?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的，我，我的意思是，我怀疑存在联系，但这是我写这本书时学到的。嗯，我查看了是否有研究表明大量使用社交媒体、视频游戏和所有电子产品会导致**ADHD**。当我在2023年进行研究时，我没有发现证据表明它会让一个原本不会患**ADHD**的孩子患上**ADHD**。我发现的证据是，对于患有**ADHD**的孩子，当你让他们使用设备、视频游戏等所有这些东西时，他们的症状会变得更糟。所以，因为能够集中注意力，发展我们一直称之为**执行功能**，能够制定计划并决定“哦，要实现这个计划，我必须做这个，然后我做这个，然后可能需要很长时间才能到达这里，但我会继续前进，我会一直盯着目标”，这是青年时期的一项重大成就。我假设你说的就是你在这方面有点困难。我的意思是，这就是**ADHD**的意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah, I I mean, I suspect that there is, but here's here's what I can tell you I learned while writing the book. Um, I looked to see if there were studies indicating that uh heavy use of of social media and video games and all the electronic stuff caused ADHD. And when I was doing the research in 2023, I did not find evidence that it will give a kid HD ADHD who otherwise wouldn't have it. What I did find was evidence that for kids who have ADHD, when you let them have the devices, the video games, all that, their symptoms get much worse. And so because it is a major achievement of young adulthood to be able to pay attention to develop what we've been calling executive function to be able to make a plan and decide oh to reach the plan I have to do this and then I do this and then it might be a long time before I get here but I will keep going and I will keep my eye on the prize that I I assume that's you're saying it's a little harder for you to do that. I mean that's what ADHD means.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你如何体验**ADHD**？嗯，嗯，嗯，我，我的意思是，如果我想到学校，我无法长时间集中注意力。这意味着我总是待在驱逐室，然后我被开除了。然后，我觉得作为成年人，情况变得更糟了。在我看来，我与手机的关系让情况变得更糟，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: How do you experience ADHD? Well, well, hm, I def I mean, if I think about school, I couldn't pay attention in school for for for very long. And that meant that I was always in the expulsion room and then I was expelled. And then that's kind of it's I feel like it's got worse as an adult. And from my in my opinion, my relationship with my phone has made it much worse

</details>

**Stephen**: 真的，我无法长时间专注于很多事情。唯一的例外是我可以长时间进行深度工作而不动。这有点像…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: where really I can't I can't pay attention to to many things for a very long time. The exception to this is I can do deep work for many many hours without moving. It was almost a bit of

</details>

**Jonathan**: 当你极度投入时。我的意思是，当你真正投入时，你就能投入。没错。但很多工作并非如此，很多工作场所的效率并非如此，你不是在追随你的热情。对。**ADHD**的孩子，他们可以非常专注，因为他们得到了**多巴胺**。他们从这件事中得到了**多巴胺**。但很多工作并非如此。这些孩子将无法做到这一点。所以实际上你所说的，与我从那些荷兰研究中发现的完全吻合。如果你确实有，无论是基因还是其他什么倾向，这个环境让你的症状变得更糟。当然，**ADHD**的孩子可以非常，嗯，有创造力，他们通常非常非常成功，但我担心他们过去成功的途径可能会被阻碍，如果他们基本上整天都在滑动屏幕，无法集中注意力，无法拥有真实的生活体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: when you are extremely motivated. I say when you're really into it, you can be into it. That's right. But a lot of work isn't that a lot of being effective in the workplace is not you're following your passion. Right. ADHD kids, they can zoom in because they're getting the dopamine. They're getting the dopamine from this thing. But a lot of work isn't like that. And these kids are not going to be able to do that. So actually what you said, it fits perfectly with what what I found from those Dutch studies. if you did have whether it's a genetic or whatever the predisposition is the this environment has made your symptoms worse. Now of course ADHD kids can be incredibly uh creative they are often very very successful but my fear is that the pathways to success that they used to take might be blocked if they basically are just scrolling all day long and not able to pay not able to um have real life experiences

</details>

**Adi**: 关系也是如此，尤其是浪漫关系。**Stephen**，你提到了一个有趣的事情，因为成人**ADHD**的诊断数量正在增加，你知道，当成年人被诊断出患有**ADHD**时，因为通常我们认为**ADHD**是一种儿科疾病或青少年疾病。所以，我们越来越多地看到30多岁、40多岁、50多岁，有时甚至是60多岁的成年人被新诊断出患有**ADHD**。所以，这是一个有趣的问题，有很多，嗯，你知道，原因，比如他们可能一直都有，但没有被诊断出来。那么那里发生了什么？那将是未来一期播客节目，邀请一位**ADHD**专家来讨论，你知道，为什么这么多成年人被诊断出患有**ADHD**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: and relationships are like that especially romantic ones. It's an interesting thing that you bring up, Stephen, because there is an increase in adult onset, you know, when adults are diagnosed with ADHD, because typically we think of ADHD as a pediatric condition or young adults. And so, increasingly, we're seeing more and more adults who are in their 30s and 40s, 50s, sometimes even 60s, who are being diagnosed, newly diagnosed with ADHD. And so, that's an interesting there's so many um, you know, reasons like it might be that they had it all along and they were diagnosed. And so what is going on there? That would be a future podcast episode for an ADHD ADHD expert of, you know, what are the drivers of why are so many adults being diagnosed with ADHD

**Stephen**: 你谈到了“**爆米花大脑**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: You talked about popcorn brain editing.

</details>

**Adi**: 是的。所以，你知道，我们谈到了**脑损伤**和原始滑动，而**爆米花大脑**是一种分支。它属于同一个家族。所以发生的情况是，这是一个由心理学家**David Levy**创造的术语。**爆米花大脑**发生的情况是，你，我们都有它。所以它是一种社会现象，当你花太多时间在线上，你被过度刺激，所以你很难花时间在线下。线下感觉缓慢、无聊，因为事情以慢得多的速度移动。所以**爆米花大脑**是你的大脑“爆裂”的感觉。它不是真的在爆裂。它不是你的脑细胞在爆裂，但感觉就像那样。所以你的原始滑动冲动会刺激你的大脑发展出**爆米花大脑**。当你感到压力时，你更容易发展出**爆米花大脑**，因为那种原始的滑动冲动。**脑损伤**和**爆米花大脑**的区别。再说一遍，这些都是我们用来描述一组症状的社会术语，对吧？所以对我来说，区别在于**爆米花大脑**是普遍存在的。它无处不在。就像我们都有它，而且它一直都在发生，因为现代社会和我们谈论的很多事情。**脑损伤**则更具体一些。它更明确。所以它有一些特定的特征，就像我们称之为**生物心理社会模型**。当你思考一种特定的医学或状况或实体时。那么生物学因素是什么？我们谈到了**脑损伤**的定义。你知道，脑电波的变化，大脑区域的变化，**杏仁核**被激活而**前额叶皮层**变得安静。嗯，心理学因素，我们谈到了注意力、复杂问题解决、冲动控制，然后是社会因素，孤独感等等。所以，嗯，强迫症。所以我会说**爆米花大脑**是我们都遭受的一种痛苦，而**脑损伤**是非常具体的东西。我们还没有谈到的另一件事是，我很想谈谈，因为我们大部分对话都像是末日和悲观，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Yeah. So, you know, we've talked about brain rot and the primal scroll and popcorn brain is kind of an offshoot. It's part of the same family. And so what happens is it's a term coined by a man a psychologist named David Levy. And what happens with popcorn brain is that you and we all have it. And so what it is a societal phenomenon when you spend too much time online and you are overstimulated and so it is hard for you to spend time offline. Offline feels slow, boring because things are moving at a much slower pace. And so popcorn brain is the sensation of your brain popping. It is not actively popping. It's not like your brain cells are popping, but it sure feels like it. And so your primal urge to scroll kind of primes your brain to develop popcorn brain. You are more at risk for developing popcorn brain when you feel a sense of stress because of that primal urge to scroll. The differentiator between brain rot and popcorn brain. Again, these are societal terms that we're calling for a constellation or a group of symptoms, right? And so the difference to me is that popcorn brain is ubiquitous. It's everywhere. It's like we all have it and it's happening all all the time because of the modern age and a lot of the things that we talked about. Brain rod is a little bit more specific. It's a little bit more well-defined. So it has certain features like we call it the biocschychosocial model. When you're thinking about a particular medical or condition or an entity. So what are the biological factors? We talked about what defines brain rod. you know, a change in brain waves, a change in brain regions, the amygdala lighting up and the prefrontal cortex kind of being quiet. Um, psychological factors, we talked about attention, um, co complex problem solving, impulse control and then the social factors, loneliness and others. So, um, compulsion and so I would say popcorn brain is something that we all suffer from and you know brain rot is something that is very specific. The other thing that we haven't talked about that I would love to kind of because so much of our conversation is like doom and gloom, right? It's likew

**Adi**: 我想说的一件事是，当你听到“**脑损伤**”这个词时，它听起来很糟糕，似乎是永久性的，因为“损伤”意味着恶化。就是这样。它是单向的，就是这样。但事实上，**爆米花大脑**和**脑损伤**是可逆的状况。所以它不是…

**Adi**: one thing that I would like to say is that as bad as when you hear the term brain rot, it seems permanent because rot it conotes like deterioration. That's it. It's one-sided is one way and that's it. But in fact, popcorn brain and brain rot are reversible conditions. So it is not

**Stephen**: 在成年人中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: in adults

</details>

**Jonathan**: 在成年人中。如果你在青春期经历过，那就不那么清楚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: in adults. If you've gone through puberty with it, it's not so clear.

</details>

**Adi**: 是的。在成年人中，我的工作重点是成年人。所以，如果你在30多岁、40多岁及以后经历**脑损伤**，你可以，这需要时间，你的大脑需要八周才能重新连接。给自己时间。自我同情非常重要。但你可以，你知道，它确实可以逆转。所以它不是一个大脑，它不是一个固定的特质，而是一种大脑状态。所以我觉得提供这种希望很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Yes. In adults, and my work focuses on adults. And so when you have, if you experience brain rot in your 30s, 40s, and beyond, you can, it takes time, you it takes eight weeks for your brain to rewire itself. Give yourself time. A sense of self-compassion is really important. But you can, you know, there is a sense of it being able to be reversed. So it's not so much a brain, it's not a fixed trait, but rather a brain state. So I think it's important to offer that hope.

</details>

**Stephen**: 什么是成年人的大脑？成年人的大脑是多大年纪？我的大脑在哪个年龄段停止生长，以至于它是可逆的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: What is an adult brain? What age is an adult brain? Like what age does my brain stop growing in in the way where it's reversible?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 所以，是的，我的意思是，你知道，传统上认为，嗯，你知道，青春期是脑部变化超快速的时期，它始于，你知道，青少年早期，有时甚至在10岁之前，并在青少年中期到后期基本结束。但**前额叶皮层**，**Adi**刚才谈到的，它对冲动控制和**执行功能**非常重要，它的髓鞘化直到25岁左右才完成。髓鞘化是指神经元获得一层脂肪鞘，就像绝缘层一样，它能锁定回路，使其更有效率。嗯，我们多年来一直说它直到25岁左右才停止。但你告诉我，有新的研究表明…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So yeah, I mean that you know traditionally it was thought that uh you know puberty is the period of super rapid brain change and that begins you know early early teens sometimes even before 10 and is mostly over by sort of you know mid to late teens. But then the prefrontal cortex which Aditi was talking about which is so important for impulse control and and executive function that doesn't finish myelinating. Myelin is when the sort of the neuron that you get a sort of a fatty sheath like an insulation that sort of locks down the circuits and makes them more efficient. Um that doesn't stop until around age 25 is what we've always said for many years. But you're telling me that there's new research showing that.

</details>

**Adi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Yeah.

</details>

**Stephen**: 告诉我们关于那个。所以，你知道，一直以来，我们都说**前额叶皮层**在25岁时完全形成并完全发挥功能。所以，当你谈论冲动控制和所有这些事情时，但有一项非常有趣的研究，我会发给你。它，嗯，研究了大约1000人，从0岁开始，也就是出生，一直到90岁，所以是整个人群。嗯，它发现了五个阶段，它研究了寿命，并说实际上有五个阶段。所以第一个是童年，从0岁到9岁。在这段时间里，你的大脑效率不高，但它确实在成长，你知道，它在成长和变化，但效率不高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Tell tell us about that. So, you know, all this time, right, we've always said that the prefrontal cortex is fully formed and fully functional at the age of 25. And so, when you're talking about impulse control and all of this stuff, but there was this really interesting study, I'll send it to you. It um looked at I think it was 1,000 people um from age zero, so birth all the way to 90, so the entire population. And um it found five, it looked at lifespan and said there are actually five stages. So first is childhood up zero to age nine. During this time your brain is not very efficient but it's really growing and you know it's it's growing and changing but it's not really efficient.

</details>

**Adi**: 9到32岁被认为是青春期，所以，你知道，32岁是青春期结束的时候，显然根据…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: 9 to 32 is considered adolescence and so you know 32 is when adolescence ends apparently according to the

</details>

**Jonathan**: 差不多吧，我的意思是，到25岁你大部分都完成了，但之后仍然有一些灵活性。然后下一个阶段是从33岁到，我想是63岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: sort of I mean you're most of the way done by 25 but but there's still some there's some flexibility even after that. And then the next stage is from 33 to I think 63.

</details>

**Adi**: 66岁是成年期。事情非常稳定。学习稳定，你知道，嗯，效率很高，而且事情进展顺利。然后，是的，66岁到大约83岁是早期衰老，所以那时你会看到一些与年龄相关的变化，然后83岁以上是晚期衰老。所以主要发现是，你知道，它登上了所有新闻。就像青春期一直持续到32岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: 66 is like adulthood. Things are very stable. Learning is stable and you know um it's efficient and it's it it things are doing well and then yeah 66 to about 83 is early aging and so that's when you see some of the age related changes and then 83 plus is late aging. So the the kind of main finding was that, you know, it was all over the news. It was like adolescence goes until 32.

</details>

**Stephen**: 所以我33岁了。所以我…

### 全球觉醒：夺回童年

**Stephen**: **Jonathan**，当你写这本书《**焦虑的一代**》时，它，嗯，以一种我认为任何作者都梦寐以求的方式对世界产生了巨大影响。我之所以知道这一点，部分原因在于，你知道，我坐在这个播客上，一直采访非常有趣的人。甚至今天早上，我在城里采访**James Ston**时，他两次提到了这本书。你知道，世界各地都受到了这本书的启发而修改了法律。我们实际上看到英国的法律数量正在增加。我的意思是，澳大利亚刚刚禁止了，我想，人们使用社交媒体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: When you wrote this book, Jonathan, the anxious generation, it um it's had a big impact on the world in a way that I think any author might dream of. And I know this in part because, you know, I sit on this podcast interviewing really interesting people all the time. And even this morning when I did an interview across town with James Ston, he talked about this book twice. And you know, laws have been changed around the world inspired by this book. And we're actually seeing an increase of laws in the UK. I mean, Australia just banned, I think, social media for people.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你见过**马克龙**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: You met with Mcronone, right?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你能想象到吗？实际上，这本书的成功说明了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Could you ever have imagined? And actually, what does the success of this book say?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 关于社会。不，谢谢你的提问，因为，你知道，我确实倾向于，你知道，正如你所听到的，我的意思是，我对这些趋势感到极其担忧，这些是超出任何人想象的巨大威胁。但令人惊奇的是，我们可以几乎不花钱就能扭转这种局面，而且它是完全两党合作的，而且做起来并不难。嗯，我们正在做。所以发生的情况是，你知道，我写这本书时是作为一个美国人，假设我们没有一个正常运作的立法机构。国会可能会被阻止。我们有一个否决制。社交媒体公司可以阻止众议院的任何事情。所以我写这本书时假设，你知道，我们永远不会得到立法。嗯，所以我们必须自己做。我提出了四项规范：高中前不使用智能手机，16岁前不使用社交媒体，无手机学校，以及在现实世界中更多的独立自由玩耍和责任。所以是四项规范。我们可以尝试在地方层面，在学校层面通过集体行动来做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: About society. No, thank you for that question because, you know, I I do tend to get, you know, as you've heard, I mean, I'm extremely alarmed about these trends and these are gigantic threats beyond what anyone can imagine. But here's the amazing thing is that we can reverse this for almost no money and it's completely bipartisan and it's not that hard to do. Um, and we're doing it. And so what happened was, you know, I wrote the book as an American assuming that we don't have a functioning legislature. The Congress can be stopped. We have a vetocracy. The social media companies can stop anything in the house. So I wrote this assuming, you know, we'll never get legislation. Um, so we have to do this on our own. And I proposed four norms. No smartphone before high school, no social media before 16, phone free schools, and far more independence free play responsibility in the real world. So four norms. We can try to do this with collective action locally at the school level.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 有两件事让我感到惊讶。一是红州和蓝州的州长们立即开始联系我。我们的州实际上是运作的。我们的州政府对人民负责，并努力取得好结果。所以这是一个完全两党合作的问题。阿肯色州的**Sarah Huckabee Sanders**是第一批之一，**Kathy Hochul**也是。而且往往是女性立法者和州长，或者是国家元首的配偶。而母亲们，这本书真正打动了母亲们，因为世界各地的母亲们都感受到了孩子们被拉走。我相信她们比父亲们更深切地感受到了这一点。此外，父亲们有点喜欢视频游戏。他们对科技更支持一些。所以，我认为母亲们感受到的痛苦更多，也更个人化。所以，当这本书出版时，世界各地的母亲们立即采取行动，组建团体，推动立法，然后改变开始发生。我刚，我刚，我刚在**达沃斯**，然后两周前在伦敦和布鲁塞尔，我看到世界对社交媒体和其他技术需要有年龄限制的看法发生了彻底的改变。这就是我认为刚刚发生的事情。这太酷了。我真的在伦敦时才突然意识到。我到处都在推动，到处都是敞开的大门。无论我走到哪里，人们都想做这件事。我去了欧盟，他们也想做。到底发生了什么？我意识到的是这个。**Steven Pinker**去年出版了一本书，叫做《**当每个人都知道每个人都知道**》。它讲述了当私人知识，你知道，每个人都知道皇帝没穿衣服。每个人都知道这种意识形态行不通。每个人都知道，但他们并不知道其他人也知道，也不知道其他人也知道。所以在《**皇帝的新装**》中，每个人都以为他，我，我不知道他有没有穿衣服，但也许，你知道，也许只有聪明人才能看到。但当孩子说：“皇帝没穿衣服。”然后**汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生**的故事中说：“然后人们开始窃窃私语，然后他们齐声喊道。”这就是澳大利亚法律生效时发生的事情。所以我相信，去年12月10日是夺回童年之战的全球转折点，如果我们夺回了童年，我们也会继续关注我们的注意力和成年生活。12月10日发生了什么？澳大利亚法律生效了。天没有塌下来。人们没有被锁定账户。所有公司都遵守了。他们关闭了澳大利亚三百万半儿童中500万个未成年账户，250万个孩子。天没有塌下来。世界各地有很多关于澳大利亚正在做什么的新闻报道。很多新闻报道都包含了作者的观点，说：“我们为什么不能这样做？嘿，我们在这里也这样做吧。”当每个人都看到每个人都在关注澳大利亚并说：“我们在这里也这样做吧。”那么每个人都知道每个人都知道，让孩子在社交媒体平台上成长，与匿名陌生人交谈，并被算法精心策划的垃圾内容喂养，这简直是完全疯了。所以我相信这就是为什么2026年将是至少15个国家承诺通过年龄限制法律的一年。2025年只有一个澳大利亚，现在我们已经有印度尼西亚。他们的法律将于3月生效。嗯，我在**达沃斯**会见了**马克龙**，几天后他正准备推动一项法案通过议会，他成功了。他是欧盟第一个这样做的，但欧盟其他许多国家也会效仿。整个欧盟很可能会这样做。嗯，所以，所以是的，我对这个问题的严重性感到极其担忧，但我对全世界都在奋起反击感到无比鼓舞。我们实际上可以掌控自己的命运，这在12月10日之前并不清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Two things that surprised me. One are that immediately governors from red states and blue states started reaching out to me. Our states actually function. Our states have governments that are accountable to the people and that are trying to get good results. And so this has been a totally bipartisan issue. Sarah Huckabe Sanders from Arkansas was one of the very first Kathy Hokll also. And it is it tends to be more female legislators and governors or spouses of heads of state. And the moms, the book really spoke to moms because moms around the world, they felt the kids being pulled away. I believe they felt it viscerally more than the dads did. Also, the dads kind of like the video games. They're a little more pro tech. So, I think the moms felt the pain more and took it more personally. So, when the book came out, mothers around the world jumped into action, formed groups, pushed for legislation, and changes began happening. What I just I just I was just I was in Davos and then London and Brussels two weeks ago and what I saw was a complete sea change in the world's thinking about how we need to have age limits on social media and other tech. And here's what I think just happened. It's it's so cool. It just dawned on me literally while I was in London. Like I was pushing on open doors everywhere. Wherever I went, people wanted to do this. I went to the EU, they want to do this. Like what is happening? And what I realized is this. Steven Pinker has a book out last year called When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows. It's about the immediate change in a social system when private knowledge, you know, everybody knows that the emperor has no clothes. Everybody knows that this, you know, ideology doesn't work. Everybody knows that, but they don't all know that everybody else knows it and that everybody else knows that. And so in the emperor's new clothes, everybody thought he's I I don't think he has any clothes on, but maybe, you know, maybe only wise people can see it. But when the child says, "The emperor has no clothes." And then in the Hans Christian Anderson story, it says, "And the people began whispering to each other and then they all cried out in unison." And that's what happened when Australia's law went into effect. So I believe that uh December 10th of last December was the global turning point in the battle to reclaim childhood and if we reclaim that we move on to our attention and adult life as well. What happened on on December 10th? The Australia law went into effect. Sky didn't fall. People weren't locked out of their accounts. All the companies complied. They shut down 5 million uh accounts for Australia's three and a half million kids that were underage uh 2 and a half million kids. this sky didn't fall. And there was a lot of news coverage around the world of what Australia was doing. And a lot of the news coverage included opinions from the writers saying, "Why can't we do that? Hey, let's do that here." And when everybody saw that everybody was looking at Australia and saying, "Let's do that here." Then everybody knew that everybody knew that this is just completely bonkers to have children being raised on social media platforms talking with anonymous strangers and being fed algorithm algorithmically curated garbage. So I believe that that's why 2026 is going to be the year when at least 15 countries are going to commit to passing an age minimum law. In 2025 it was one Australia and now we already have Indonesia. Their law goes into effect in March. Uh I met with Macron in in Davos and a few days he was preparing to push a bill through the assembly and he got it. He's the first in the EU but a lot of other countries in the EU are going to follow. The whole EU is likely to do it. Um, so, so yes, I am incredibly alarmed about how big this problem is, but I'm incredibly inspired that the whole world is rising up to do something about it. We actually can control our fate, and that was not clear before December 10th.

**Stephen**: 这真是一个特别的成就，**Jonathan**。你知道，我无法用言语来完全表达它将对数十亿人的生活产生的长期影响。不仅仅是直接影响，还有我们所描述的所有间接影响，他们建立连接、坠入爱河、在生活中找到意义和目标的能力。以及他们的神经科学，因此，你知道，他们的孩子和孩子的孩子的神经科学等等。所以这是一个真正令人振奋的成就。

**Stephen**: It's a really special accomplishment, Jonathan. You know, I could there's no real words that I could say that could quite capture the long-term impact that that's going to have on billions of people's lives. And not just the direct, but also the indirect in all the ways we've described, their ability to form connections, to fall in love, to find meaning and purpose in their lives. and their neuroscience and therefore you know the neuroscience of their their children and their children's children and so on. So it's a really it's a really overwhelming accomplishment.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 嗯，这是一个我以社会心理学家的独特能力偶然进入的奇怪境地。那就是每个人都为此感到不安。每个人都能看到，但他们认为“好吧，这是我的问题，或者在我的家庭中我们有这个问题”，嗯，我带着全新的视角来看待这个问题。我的博士论文是关于**道德发展**的。我在职业生涯早期研究过青少年行为，并在我的所有书中都写过。所以对我来说这并不是全新的。但我大约在2018年、2019年进入社交媒体研究领域。我真正沉浸其中。就像，你知道，你走进去，立刻就看到，“等等，这是一个陷阱。”人们使用它是因为其他人都在使用它，孩子们对此抱怨。每个人都在抱怨，他们无法摆脱的唯一原因是因为其他人都在使用它。所以，我想我能够看到这一点。然后**新冠疫情**也让我们困惑了几年。所以直到**新冠疫情**成为过去式，每个人才有可能说：“等等，这太疯狂了。”所以我在时机上非常幸运。我的书恰好在2024年3月出版，正当世界准备好看到“等等，我们对孩子做了什么？让我们纠正它”的时候。

<details>

**Jonathan**: It it well it was a bizarre situation that I walked into with the unique abilities of a social psychologist. That is everybody was upset about this. Everybody could see it but they thought well this is my problem or in my family we have this problem and um and I came to this with fresh eyes. My dissertation was on moral development. I'd studied adolescent behavior longer ago in my career and I've written about it in all my books. So, it wasn't totally new to me. But I came into the field of social media studies around 2018 2019. I really immersed myself in it. And it was like, you know, you walk in and immediately you see, wait, this is a trap. People are on it because people are on it and the kids are complaining about that. Everyone's complaining about it and the only reason they can't get off is because everyone else is on it. So, I think I was able to see that. And then also CO confused us for a few years. So it wasn't until CO was in the rearview mirror that it was possible for everybody to say, "Wait, this is crazy." And so I was incredibly lucky in terms of the timing. My book happened to come out in March of 2024 just as the world was ready to see like, wait, what have we done to our kids? Let's undo it.

</details>

**Stephen**: 你说你现在更专注于短视频了。所以，是的，在研究较年长的**Z世代**时，这些人是在**Instagram**上度过青春期的。嗯，我应该，如果我能简单说明一下，让每个人都理解时机非常重要，因为这就是你之前提到的**多重危机**。我相信**多重危机**始于2010年至2015年之间。原因如下。我们使用互联网已经很长时间了，它曾是奇妙的。我们喜欢90年代的互联网。它将成为民主最好的朋友。好的？然后**iPhone**问世了。它很棒。天哪，它能做这么多事情。一切看起来都很棒。好的，所以在2010年，我们几乎所有人都使用翻盖手机。**iPhone**正在普及，但仍然主要是翻盖手机。青少年都使用翻盖手机，基本款手机，我们称这些人是**千禧一代**。如果你在20岁之前完成了青春期，如果你出生在1990年左右，你在2002年开始青春期，到2008年就完成了。所以，你知道，在那段时间里。如果你在接触**Instagram**之前度过了青春期，你就是**千禧一代**。然而，如果你出生在1995年之后，但假设你出生在2000年，你在2012年开始青春期，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: And you said you're now focusing more on short form video. So yes, so in studying older Gen Z, these are the people who went through puberty uh on Instagram. Um I should if I could just lay out that it's very important to get the timing to that everyone understands the timing because this is what you mentioned the poly crisis before. The poly crisis I believe begins between 2010 and 2015. Here's why. So we've had the internet for a long time and it was marvelous. We love the internet in the 90s. It's going to be the best friend of democracy. Okay? And then the iPhone comes out. It's amazing. Oh my god, this does so many things. Everything seems great. Okay, so in 2010, most of almost all of us have flip phones. The iPhone's spreading, but it's still mostly flip phones. Teens are all on flip phones, basic phones, and we call those people millennials. If you finished puberty by 20, if you if you were born in say 1990 and you start puberty uh in 2002, you're done by 2008. So, you know, in there. Um if you got through puberty before you got on Instagram, you're a millennial. Whereas, if you're born, say, well, if you're born after 1995, but let's say if you're born in the year 2000, you begin puberty in 2012

</details>

**Stephen**: 直到2016年、2018年才完成。所以，在2010年，每个人都有一部翻盖手机，没有前置摄像头，没有高速互联网。你必须为短信付费。所以你用它来打电话和发短信，仅此而已。它是一个通信设备。这就是为什么**千禧一代**心理健康状况良好。他们是最后一批心理健康且成功的世代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: and you're not done until 2016, 2018. So, in 2010, everyone has a flip phone with no front-facing camera, no high-speed internet. You have to pay for your text. So, you use it to call people and to text them, and that's it. It was a communication device. And that's why the millennials have good mental health. They are the last mentally healthy and successful generation.

</details>

**Stephen**: 但如果你是**Z世代**，你在2012年，现在大多数人都有智能手机了。那一年**Facebook**收购了**Instagram**。他们一开始没有改变它，但那一年所有女孩都开始使用它。嗯，现在每个人都有高速数据，前置摄像头。2010年问世。所以到2015年，我们处于一个对儿童发展来说截然不同的世界。它现在截然不同，对人类发展更具敌意。这就是我们对**Z世代**所做的，现在我们正在对**Alpha世代**这样做。对于政治来说，它，你知道，在每个十年都因为各种原因而疯狂。尤其是在2000年代早期，有很多文化战争。有很多事情发生。但当每个人都有**Twitter**，每个人都一直在查看，任何事情都可能爆发时，你知道，你描述了**TikTok**上的差异。嗯，如果你做得恰到好处，它就会爆发。你可以产生巨大的影响。那就是当民主，民主是一种对话，当它从报纸和，你知道，甚至简单的网络公告板，转移到超级病毒式转发按钮，所有这些。那都是2010年到2015年。所以这就是为什么从那时起一切都变得疯狂，而且只会变得更疯狂。这就是为什么我相信我们有这场**多重危机**，因为它，它，它还有更多。不仅仅是技术，但我相信我们的连接和信息流的转变以及我们的成瘾，所有这些在2015年与2010年相比都截然不同。现在所有其他一切都建立在此之上，我相信。你觉得呢？你认为这说得通吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: But if you're Gen Z, you got uh 2012 is the year that now most people now have a smartphone. It's the year that Facebook buys Instagram. They don't change it at first, but that's the year that all the girls go on it. Um, everyone now has high-speed data, front-facing camera. Came out in 2010. So by 2015, we're in a radically different world for children's development. It's now radically different, much more hostile to human development. And that's what we did to Gen Z and now we're doing to Gen Alpha. For politics, it was, you know, it was crazy for all sorts of reasons in every decade. And especially, you know, the in the early 2000s, there's a lot there's a culture war going on. There's all kinds of stuff going on. But it was when it was when everyone has really Twitter was the biggest perpetrator of this. when everyone has Twitter and everyone's checking all the time and anything can blow up. You know, you described the way there was, you know, variance in in on Tik Tok. Um, if you get it just right, it can blow up. You can have huge impact. That's when the democrac democracy is a conversation when it moved from newspapers and, you know, even simple web bulletin boards when it moved to super viral retweet buttons all of that. That's all 2010 to 2015. So that's why since then everything has been insane and it's going to just keep getting more insane. And that's why I believe we have this poly crisis because it it there's more to it. It's not just the technology, but I believe the transformation of our our connection and our information flow and our addiction, all of that is radically different by 2015 compared to how it was in 2010. And now everything else builds on top of that, I believe. What What do you think? Do you think that makes sense?

</details>

**Stephen**: 我认为还有一个数据点要补充，那就是2014年是事情真正发生转折点的一年，就像你说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: 你指的是什么？当你查看数据时，你会看到从1960年代到2014年的独处时间，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: what do you point to? What what you look at the data you see that time spent alone when you compare when you look at data from like the 1960s to 2014

</details>

**Adi**: 它一直保持稳定。美国人独处的时间，与朋友相处的时间。

<details>

**Stephen**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yeah.

</details>

**Adi**: 差不多一样。对。所以人们与朋友相处的时间，独处的时间，在那些几十年里差不多一样。2014年标志着一个转变，独处时间急剧增加，与朋友相处的时间下降。那么2014年发生了什么？那是大多数美国人拥有智能手机的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Kind of the same. Right. So people spent kind of same amount of time with friends, same amount of time alone over those decades. 2014 marks a shift and there is a steep rise in time spent alone and a drop in time spent with friends. And so what happens in 2014? It is when the majority of Americans get a smartphone.

**Adi**: 这并不是说，再说一遍，我们说过，你知道，因果关系还是相关性，到底是哪个，但基于我们谈论的所有事情，天哪，这之间难道没有关联吗？这并不是说独处时间，你知道，当我分享这些数据时，人们可能会说，你知道，但我喜欢独处，我不孤独，我很好。这与内向或外向无关，与，你知道，你可以享受孤独并感觉很棒，你并不孤独无关，但我们是人类，我们是社会性生物。这正是我们进化上的构造。所以，当你看到独处时间大幅增加，而且恰好在同一年，这是一个真正的危险信号。所以我的工作重点是成年人，**Jonathan**的工作重点是孩子，但有这个，你知道，那就是2014年，一切都改变了的时刻。

**Adi**: And it's not to say again we've said you know causality correlation which is it but there is like based on everything that we've talked about my gosh is there an association between that this is not to say that time spent alone you know when I share this data people may say you know but I like spending time alone I'm not lonely I'm okay this is not about being an introvert or an extrovert it's not about you know you can have solitude and feel great and you're not lonely but we are human beings and we are social creatures. This is just how we are built evolutionarily. And so that is a real red flag when you have this big jump in time spent alone very much the same year. And so my work focuses on adults Jonathan on kids but there's this you know that's the moment right 2014 where everything changed.

### 赞助商信息与行动呼吁

**Stephen**: 上个月我告诉过你我们的赞助商**Function Health**及其团队，他们开发了一种方法，可以让你全面了解你身体内部发生的一切。他们提供100多项高级实验室测试，涵盖激素、毒素、炎症、心脏健康、压力等等。所以，和我一起创办这个节目的**Jack**，几周前做了他的第一次抽血。所以，我想让他告诉你更多关于他的经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Last month I told you about our sponsor Function Health and their team who've developed a way of giving you a full 360 view of what's going on inside your body. They offer over 100 advanced lab tests covering everything from hormones, toxins, inflammation, heart health, stress, and so much more. So, Jack, who started this show with me, got his first blood draw done a couple of weeks ago. So, I thought I'd let him tell you a little bit more about his experience.

</details>

**Jack**: 这项测试真的让我明白了，我个人应该如何管理我的健康。我在这个播客中听到了很多信息。我正在睡觉，所以知道如何将每一个信息与我个人联系起来，这非常有价值。你注册并安排你的测试。一旦完成，你会得到一份小报告，就像我这里这份。我可以看到我的正常范围结果，我的超出范围结果。还有一个小的**AI**功能。所以，如果我对我的超出范围结果有任何疑问，我可以直接进去问它任何问题。这些测试都得到了医生和数千小时研究的支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack**: This test really opened my eyes to personally what I should be doing with my health. I hear a lot of information in this podcast. I sleing, so to know how I can relate each one to me personally is super valuable. You sign up and you schedule your test. And once you're done, you get a little report like the one I have here. I can see my inrange results, my out of range results. And there's a little AI function, too. So, if I have any questions about my out of range results, I can just go in there and ask it any question I want. And these tests are backed by doctors and thousands of hours of research.

</details>

**Stephen**: You get an annual draw done and a midyear follow-up. So, if you want to learn more, head over to functionhealth.com/doac where you can sign up for a $365 a year. I'll put the link in the description below. It is just $1 a day for your health. There's a phase a lot of companies hit where they're no longer doing the most important thing, which is selling, and they get really bogged down with admin. And it's often something that creeps up slowly, and you don't really notice until it's happened. Slowly, momentum starts to leak out. This happened to us, and our sponsor, Pipe Drive, was a fix I came across 10 years ago. And ever since, my teams across my different companies have continued to use it. Pipe Drive is a simple but powerful sales CRM that gives you the visibility on any deals in your pipeline. It also automates a lot of the tedious, repetitive, and time-conuming parts of the sales process, which in turn saves you so many hours every single month, which means you can get back to selling. Making that early decision to switch to Pipe Drive was a real gamecher, and it's kept the right things front of mind. My favorite feature is Pipe Drive's ability to sync your CRM with multiple email inboxes so your entire team can work together from one platform. And we aren't the only ones benefiting. Over 100,000 companies use Pipe Drive to grow their business. So, if something I've said resonates, head over to pipedive.com/ceeo where you can get a 30-day free trial. No credit card or payment required.

### 应对数字危机的策略

**Stephen**: 那么，我们该怎么办？因为当我查看所有数据时，我们在这之前做了所有这些观众调查。我们的观众平均每天花大约六个半小时在手机上。嗯，短视频只会变得更具成瘾性。**AI**会更了解我。它会更个性化。内容会专门为我生成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: So, what do we do about this? Because when I look at all the stats, we did all these audience surveys ahead of this. People are spending roughly in our audience about 6 and a half hours a day on their phones. Um, short form video is only going to get more addictive. AI is going to know me more. It's going to be more personalized. The content is going to be generated just for me.

</details>

**Stephen**: 是的。我该怎么办？下一步是什么？我们需要通过一项法律吗？还是我需要自己做些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: Yeah. What what am I what what's next? Is it a law we need to pass? Is it something I need to do myself?

</details>

**Jonathan**: 所以我们，我认为我们首先需要摘取**低垂的果实**。原因不仅仅是效率。而是我们必须证明我们确实能做些什么，因为我们从未做过任何事情。我们从未做过任何事情来限制这一点。我们任由**硅谷**肆意妄为。国会给了他们特殊保护，即**第230条**。没有人可以因为他们向孩子提供内容而起诉他们，即使这导致孩子死亡。他们不能被追究责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: So we I think we need to pick the lowhanging fruit first. And the reason for that is not just efficiency. It's that we have to prove that we can actually do something because we've never done anything. We've never done anything to restrain this. We've let Silicon Valley run wild. Congress gave them special protection. Section 230. Nobody can sue them for killing their kids if if they feed them content. They can't be held responsible.

</details>

**Stephen**: 我认为**第230条**可能值得解释一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: I think section 230 is probably something worth explaining.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 当然。**通信内容法案**，我想是1997年，一年快乐矿工。嗯，其中有一个条款，目标是专门让像当时的**AOL**这样的科技公司，你知道，让他们删除色情内容，因为他们担心如果我们删除任何东西，那么我们就要对所有东西负责，现在我们要，你知道，结束了。所以国会明确表示，不，别担心，别担心，你知道，如果你选择删除某些东西，没有人可以因为你保留了什么而起诉你。所以，最初的意图是好的，但法院对其解释得如此宽泛，以至于说：“没有人可以监管社交媒体。他们对伤害孩子不负责任。你不能起诉他们。”他们从未面对过陪审团。他们从未，没有一个父母曾从他们那里得到正义，尽管有那么多孩子的生活被毁了。所有孩子都死了。而这即将改变。这正在改变，就在现在，在二月份的洛杉矶。所以因为美国国会制造了这个问题，而且它还在另一项法律中规定，孩子必须多大才能让公司在未经父母知情或允许的情况下获取他们的数据？孩子必须多大才能让公司让他们接触各种各样的东西？孩子必须多大才能让公司让他们放弃自己的权利？最初的法律规定是16岁。让我们试试16岁。你知道，因为，你知道，当时还没有那么病态和扭曲，1998年被《**儿童在线隐私保护法**》涵盖。所以，但各种游说活动把年龄从16岁降到了13岁，并削弱了执法。所以，只要，这就是为什么在互联网上到处都是“你13岁了吗？”或者“你的出生年份是什么？”只要你13岁，你就可以接触色情内容，而你必须说你18岁。所以，因为我们，是几项法律造成了这个问题。我们绝对需要法律来纠正它，尤其是对孩子。所以，我主张的是，让我们先做那些容易的、影响大的事情，为了孩子，因为这完全没有政治争议。在这方面没有左右之分，而且在澳大利亚、英国、欧盟，到处都是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Sure. The communications decency act 1997 I think it it was pleasure miners a year. Uh there's a section in it that the goal was to specifically let the tech companies like AOL back then you know let them take down pornographic content because they were afraid if we take down anything then we're responsible for everything and now we're going to it's going to be end you know. So Congress specifically said no don't worry don't worry you know if you choose to take something down nobody can sue you for you know for what you leave up. So, it was a good intention originally, but the courts have interpreted so widely as to say, "No one can regulate social media. They're not responsible for hurting kids. You can't sue them." And they have never faced a jury. They have never, no parent has ever gotten justice from them despite all the kids whose lives have been ruined. All the kids are dead. And that's going to change. That's changing just now here in February in Los Angeles. So because the US Congress sort of set up this problem and it also in a different law said how old does a kid have to be before a company can take their data without their parents knowledge or permission before a company can expose them to all kinds of stuff before a company can have them sign away their rights? How old? And the original law said 16. Let's try 16. You know cuz you know it wasn't so sick and twisted back then 1998 caught by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. So, but various lobbying they pushed it down from 16 to 13 and they gutted enforcement. So, as long as and that's why all over the internet it's are you 13 or what's your birth year and as long as you're 13 you're in for porn and you have to say you're 18. So, because we the it's a few laws that set this up. We definitely need laws to undo it especially for kids. So, what I'm advocating is let's do the easy stuff the high impact stuff for kids because that is totally not politically controversial. There is no left-right divide on that and that's been true everywhere. Australia, Britain, the EU, everywhere.

</details>

**Jonathan**: 监管成年人的互联网，监管社交媒体对其在民主中的破坏性作用，要困难得多。我没有简单的答案。我们可以做很多事情来减少病毒式传播，减少极端内容的传播。所以有很多小事情我们可以做。**Facebook**的举报人**Frances Haugen**提出了各种想法。所以我们肯定可以做一些事情来减少它对民主的毒害。但这些将具有政治争议，因为一方将比另一方受益更多。所以这会非常困难。我不知道我们能否在美国做到。但让我们都来保护孩子。这样我们就能在全球范围内展示我们确实能做些什么。如果我们做到了，那么我认为我们将能够对**AI**做一些基本的事情，比如18岁以下不能使用伴侣聊天机器人。你知道这些东西已经造成了伤亡。很多孩子被鼓励自杀。它们已经导致数百万人陷入精神病。所以，我相信我们将能够对**AI**，尤其是对孩子施加一些限制。但如果我们不能在社交媒体上为孩子赢得胜利，那么我认为我们没有任何机会监管**AI**，那会困难得多。你觉得呢？你认为我们应该做什么？你认为我们能做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan**: Regulating the internet for adults, regulating social media for its destructive properties in democracy is a hell of a lot harder. And I don't have easy answers. There's a lot we could do to reduce the verality, the spread of of the because extreme. So there are lots of little things that we can do. And Francis Hogan, the Facebook whistler, had all kinds of ideas. So we definitely can do things to make it less toxic for democracy. But those are going to be politically controversial because one side is going to benefit from more than the other. So it's going to be very difficult to do. I don't know if we can do them in the US. But let's just all do the let's just all protect the kids. That way we show globally that we actually can do something. And if we do that then I think we will be able to do some basic things about AI like no companion chat bots if you're under 18. You know these things already have a body count. A lot of kids have been encouraged to kill themselves. they already have driven million or hundreds of thousands or millions of people into psychosis. So, we'll be able to, I believe, put some limits on uh on AI, especially for kids. But if we can't get this, if we can't win on social media for kids, then I don't think we have any chance to regulate AI, it's going to be much more difficult. What do you think? What do you think we should do? And what do you think we can do?

</details>

**Adi**: 所以，作为一名医生，我思考我们能做什么，以及我如何赋能人们首先建立意识。所以，你知道，我旨在首先规范和验证与聊天机器人互动的所有人的体验。所以，我不喜欢羞辱别人，因为作为一名医生，对吧，你希望，你希望在病人所处的境地与他们见面。所以，我不会羞辱某人说，你知道，你为什么使用这个，嗯，为什么你的男朋友是**AI**，或者你为什么嫁给**AI**，或者你为什么使用**AI**作为治疗师？我社交媒体上的一位粉丝，这仍然让我发笑。我发了一个帖子说：“你为什么使用**AI**作为你的治疗师？”你知道，然后有人回复我，这很棒。我截了图。上面写着：“因为所有人类治疗师都是垃圾。”还带了一个垃圾桶表情符号，这让我发笑，我说，你知道，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: So, my work as a doctor, I think about what we can do and how I can empower people to first build awareness. So, you know, I aim to first normalize and validate the experience with everyone who is engaging with chat bots. And so, I don't like to shame people because as a doctor, right, like you want you want to meet the patient where they are. And so, I won't shame someone to say, you know, why are you using this um why is your boyfriend AI or why are you getting married to AI or why are you using AI for a therapist? One of my followers on social media, it still makes me laugh. I put out a call saying, "Why are you using AI as your as a therapist, you know, and so someone wrote to me, it was great. I screenshotted. It said,"Because all human therapists are trash." With a trash can emoji and it made me laugh and I said, you know,

</details>

**Adi**: 所以有。所以对我来说，当我思考正在发生什么以及我们能做什么时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: so there is. So to me, when I think about what's happening and what we can do,

</details>

**Adi**: 我们现在在这里并非偶然。所以**新冠疫情**，就像我们谈到的，是一个巨大的驱动因素。社会隔离，嗯，对自我的过度依赖，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: it's no mistake that we're here right now. So the pandemic, like we've talked about, was a huge driver. social isolation, uh, hyper reliance on self, right?

</details>

**Adi**: 然后是技术的扩散，它取代了人际互动，**Zoom**董事会议，**Zoom**葬礼，**Zoom**生日派对，**Zoom**毕业典礼，我们以前亲自做的事情现在都在线上。然后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Then the proliferation of technology that replaced human interaction, Zoom board meetings, Zoom funerals, Zoom birthday parties, Zoom graduations, things that we did in person are now online. And then

</details>

**Adi**: 就我个人而言，作为一名医生，我在疫情期间是许多新闻频道的评论员，谈论疫苗。我也有公共卫生背景。对建制派和专家的巨大不信任。所以就像，我要自己研究。我不会去看医生或治疗师。我要和我的聊天机器人交谈。而且，我的意思是，你知道，说实话，成本，对吧？所以人们正在挣扎。他们处于金融危机中。是的，对人际连接有未被满足的需求，但对好的治疗或好的医疗保健也有需求，因为疫情导致了巨大的需求，人们没有得到他们需要和应得的护理，这里有很多因素。所以今年我特别关注的是学习**AI聊天机器人**，它们如何影响心理健康，实际发生了什么，因为我首先是人，其次才是**AI**。就像我的工作专注于高接触，而**AI**是高科技，这是我们看到的第一个高科技正在变得高接触的干预措施，这让我很害怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: personally as a doctor, I was a talking head during the pandemic for lots of news channels about the vaccine. I have a background in public health as well. a immense distrust and mistrust in establishment and experts. And so it's like, I'm going to do my own research. I'm not going to go see a doctor or a therapist. I'm going to talk to my chatbot. And also, I mean, you know, let's keep it real, the cost, right? So people are struggling. They're in financial crisis. it there's an unmet need yes for human connection but also for good therapy or you know good medical care because there is such a need because of the pandemic and people aren't getting the care that they need they deserve there's so many factors here and so what I've been focusing on this year particularly is learning about AI chat bots how they are influencing mental health what is actually happening because I'm a human first AI second person it's like my work focuses on high touch and AI is high tech and this is the first intervention that we are seeing that is high tech that is becoming high touch and that scares me

</details>

**Stephen**: 你现在正在写一本关于这个的书，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: and you're writing a book about that at the moment right

</details>

**Adi**: 我是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: I am and so

</details>

**Stephen**: 机器人大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: bot brain

</details>

**Adi**: 它叫做《**机器人大脑**：在**AI**面前如何保持冷静、韧性和人性》。所以真正思考我们如何与这项技术共存。我喜欢**Jonathan**的立场，就是说，**AI**伴侣，对孩子来说不行。是的，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: it's called bot brain how to stay calm resilient and human in the face of AI and so really thinking about how are we going to be able to live with this technology I love Jonathan stance is to say out AI AI companions done kids. Yeah,

</details>

**Stephen**: 对于孩子。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen**: for kids. Yeah.

</details>

**Adi**: 直到被证明安全为止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adi**: Until proven safe.

</details>

**Adi**: 完全同意。但对于成年人来说，我们如何管理呢？你知道吗？所以我的工作现在专注于，我一直在花时间，
