title: 迪士尼财报深度解析：DTC业务利润率提升，市场波动与美联储政策展望
---
### 开场与市场概览

大家好，欢迎来到本周全勤更新的专业美股频道。今天我们将深入探讨一只备受关注的价值股——**迪士尼**（Disney），该公司在周四盘间发布了财报。尽管周四收盘时股价下跌，但我个人认为其基本面正持续改善，且当前估值相当合理，甚至偏低。稍后，我将详细分析这份财报并更新对迪士尼的估值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, and welcome to this professional U.S. stock channel, which, despite originally planning three updates a week, seems to be going full attendance this week. Today, we'll dive deep into a highly anticipated value stock: **Disney**. The company released its earnings report during Thursday's trading session. Although the stock price fell at market close on Thursday, I personally believe its fundamentals are continuously improving, and its current valuation is quite reasonable, even somewhat undervalued. Later, I will provide a detailed analysis of this earnings report and update my valuation for Disney.</p>
</details>

在深入财报之前，我们先来聊聊当前市场。周四，资产价格走势显示美元和美债有所波动，美联储成员的讲话也带来了一些影响。近期我较少更新宏观经济和美联储相关内容，因为我认为美联储的行动更多是市场背景噪音。例如，周一市场反弹时，许多人归因于美国政府“开门”的利好，但随后两天美股却再次下跌。这表明市场总是在事后寻找理由，试图从结果倒推原因，而这些理由往往无法持续解释未来的价格走势，因此参考价值有限。美国政府的开门与否，对股市价格走势而言，更像是一种噪音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we get into the earnings, let's discuss the current market. On Thursday, asset price trends showed some volatility in the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds, with comments from Federal Reserve members also having an impact. Recently, I haven't updated much on macroeconomics and the Federal Reserve because, frankly, I view the Fed's actions more as market background noise. For instance, when the market rebounded on Monday, many attributed it to the positive news of the U.S. government "reopening," but then the U.S. stock market fell again in the following two days. This illustrates that the market always tries to find reasons after the fact, attempting to derive causes from outcomes. These reasons often fail to consistently explain future price movements, thus offering limited reference value. Whether the U.S. government is open or not, it's largely market noise for stock price trends.</p>
</details>

当前市场交易的主流逻辑是，估值已处于高位，市场正在讨论**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）是否存在泡沫，并由此引发了单纯的“杀估值”现象。前段时间表现出色的个股，在周四市场下跌中也未能幸免。这再次印证了我的观点：无论一家公司的基本面有多好，一旦其股价被大量情绪面和投机资金所驱动，其跌幅可能高达20%至30%，甚至40%至50%都不足为奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The prevailing market narrative currently is that valuations are high, and there's a debate about whether **AI** (Artificial Intelligence) has a bubble, leading to a pure "valuation kill" phenomenon. Stocks that performed exceptionally well previously were not spared in Thursday's market downturn. This reaffirms my view: no matter how strong a company's fundamentals are, once its stock price is driven by significant sentiment and speculative capital, it can easily fall by 20% to 30%, or even 40% to 50% from its peak.</p>
</details>

周四市场确实出现了较大幅度的下跌，垃圾级别债券的利差上升了8个基点。三大指数主要由大型科技股领跌，其中标普500下跌1.7%，纳斯达克指数下跌2.3%，道琼斯指数下跌1.7%。从板块表现来看，防守型板块如必需品消费（几乎未跌）、能源（上涨0.3%）、医疗（跌幅很小）和保险（上涨0.2%）则表现出相对强势。前期领涨的大型科技股下跌2.7%，而等权指数也下跌了1.1%，表明周四的下跌是普遍性的，但防守板块仍具韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Indeed, the market experienced a significant decline on Thursday, with the spread on junk bonds rising by 8 basis points. The three major indices were primarily led lower by large-cap tech stocks; the S&P 500 fell by 1.7%, the Nasdaq by 2.3%, and the Dow Jones by 1.7%. Looking at sector performance, defensive sectors such as consumer staples (barely fell), energy (up 0.3%), healthcare (very small decline), and insurance (up 0.2%) showed relative strength. Earlier, leading large-cap tech stocks fell by 2.7%, and the equal-weighted index also dropped by 1.1%, indicating a broad-based decline on Thursday, yet defensive sectors remained resilient.</p>
</details>

市场参与度方面，标普500成分股中，129家上涨，371家下跌，约70%的公司出现下跌。纳斯达克指数表现更弱，3000多家公司中仅约600家上涨，即不到20%的公司上涨，其余80%均下跌。然而，参与度的跌幅并不算大，这可能预示着市场下方仍有调整空间。尽管周四下跌，标普500的20日均线仍有47%的股票在其上方，5日均线为44%。纳斯达克指数则相对较弱，两条均线覆盖率均为31%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of market participation, 129 companies in the S&P 500 rose, while 371 fell, meaning approximately 70% of companies experienced a decline. The Nasdaq performed even weaker, with only about 600 out of over 3,000 companies rising, which is less than 20%, while the remaining 80% fell. However, the magnitude of the decline in participation wasn't that large, which might suggest there's still room for further adjustment in the market. Despite Thursday's decline, 47% of S&P 500 stocks were still above their 20-day moving average, and 44% were above their 5-day moving average. The Nasdaq was relatively weaker, with both moving averages covering only 31% of its stocks.</p>

### 市场噪音与贝塔风险

早在年初，我就开始和大家探讨**贝塔系数**（Beta Coefficient: 衡量投资组合或个股相对于市场整体波动性的指标）的概念，以及何时应该“降贝塔”或“升贝塔”。今天，我在**X**（X: 即原Twitter社交媒体平台）上看到两位知名人士也在讨论这一话题。其中一位，James，提到如果几周前你还在为股票在短短几个月内上涨200%甚至400%而沾沾自喜，现在却疑惑为何突然下跌35%，而同期市场最高点仅下跌2%，那么你可能需要深入理解贝塔系数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As early as the beginning of the year, I started discussing the concept of **Beta Coefficient** (Beta Coefficient: a measure of the volatility of a portfolio or individual stock in relation to the overall market) and when one should "lower beta" or "raise beta." Today, I saw two prominent figures on **X** (X: formerly Twitter social media platform) also discussing this topic. One of them, James, mentioned that if a few weeks ago you were gloating about your stock rising 200% or even 400% in just a few months, but now you're wondering why it suddenly dropped 35%, while the overall market only fell 2% from its peak, then you might need to deeply understand the Beta Coefficient.</p>
</details>

贝塔系数衡量的是你的投资组合或个股相对于标普500指数的波动率。投资高波动性的个股，上涨时固然令人欣喜，但下跌时也会同样剧烈。一个关键点是：即使你的标的上涨100%（翻倍），只要从最高点下跌50%，你之前的全部涨幅就会被抹去。这不是等量的下跌；上涨100%后，只需下跌50%即可归零。如果从最高点下跌20%，你感觉只跌了20%，但实际上已经抹去了之前100%涨幅的40%。因此，了解并管理你的投资组合贝塔系数至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Beta Coefficient measures the volatility of your investment portfolio or individual stock relative to the S&P 500 index. Investing in highly volatile stocks can be exhilarating when they rise, but equally painful when they fall. A crucial point is: even if your asset rises by 100% (doubles), a 50% drop from its peak will wipe out all your previous gains. This is not an equal decline; a 100% rise only requires a 50% fall to return to zero. If it falls 20% from its peak, you might feel it's only a 20% drop, but it has actually erased 40% of your previous 100% gain. Therefore, understanding and managing your portfolio's Beta Coefficient is extremely important.</p>

此外，近期有观众咨询下周在美国西部两个城市（洛杉矶和硅谷）举办的线下交流活动。洛杉矶的活动在周四和周五，硅谷在周六，共两场。我将亲自前往，与大家进行纯粹的线下交流，不收取任何费用。报名链接将置于置顶留言中，并会在活动前三天通过邮件确认报名信息，请大家留意查收邮件。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Additionally, some viewers have recently inquired about the upcoming offline networking events in two West Coast cities (Los Angeles and Silicon Valley) next week. The Los Angeles events are on Thursday and Friday, and Silicon Valley's is on Saturday, totaling two sessions. I will personally attend to engage in purely offline discussions with everyone, free of charge. The registration link will be placed in the pinned comment, and I will confirm registrations via email three days before the event, so please keep an eye on your inbox.</p>
</details>

接下来，我们关注一些新闻。第一条是关于**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump）计划大幅降低对拉丁美洲国家的关税，以抑制食品价格上涨。我个人认为，特朗普是一个相对务实的人，他会着手解决他识别出的问题。从股市的底层逻辑来看，这可能意味着他会积极应对经济挑战。然而，即使我们知道特朗普的政策可能为股市提供一个“底线”，但这个底线并非我们个人账户的底线。如果你持有高贝塔资产，当市场回调时，你的账户可能下跌30%甚至40%，远超指数的10%跌幅，此时你可能无法承受而选择清仓。因此，控制风险至关重要，即使有政策“底线”，你也需要确保自己能守住并等到其发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, let's look at some news. The first item is about **Donald Trump's** plan to significantly lower tariffs on Latin American countries to curb rising food prices. Personally, I believe Trump is a relatively pragmatic individual who will address problems he identifies. From a fundamental stock market perspective, this could mean he will actively tackle economic challenges. However, even if we know Trump's policies might provide a "floor" for the stock market, this floor isn't necessarily the floor for our individual accounts. If you hold high-beta assets, your account might drop 30% or even 40% during a market correction, far exceeding the index's 10% drop, at which point you might be unable to withstand it and choose to liquidate. Therefore, risk control is crucial; even with a policy "floor," you need to ensure you can hold on and wait for it to take effect.</p>
</details>

我近期在X上多次提醒大家，不要盲目“逢低买入”（buy the dip），尤其是在本季度财报季。许多中小盘股即使财报表现出色，股价也可能因“利好出尽”（sell the news）而下跌，甚至跌破前期的相对低位。这往往是因为情绪溢价已经透支了未来两到三年的盈利。如果当前的下跌已让你感到不安，我建议你直接锁定已盈利的仓位，保留部分利润。不要去猜测明天的涨跌，因为过去一段时间的涨幅可能已超出你的预期，与你可接受的涨幅不匹配。如果涨幅不匹配，那么当前的下跌也同样会让你难以接受。股市一年7%-8%的回报才是常态，而非近期纳斯达克指数40%以上的涨幅。我们赚的是市场的钱，而非我们选股能力超群的**阿尔法**（Alpha: 超额收益，指投资组合在承担同等风险的情况下，跑赢市场基准的收益）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have repeatedly reminded everyone on X recently not to blindly "buy the dip," especially during this earnings season. Many small and mid-cap stocks, even with excellent earnings reports, might see their prices fall due to "sell the news" phenomena, even breaking below previous relative lows. This is often because emotional premiums have already priced in two to three years of future earnings. If the current downturn makes you uncomfortable, I suggest locking in your profitable positions and securing some gains. Don't try to predict tomorrow's ups and downs, because the gains from the past period might have already exceeded your expectations and don't match your acceptable level of return. If the gains don't match, then the current downturn will also be hard for you to accept. An annual return of 7%-8% for the stock market is normal, not the recent 40%+ surge in the Nasdaq. We earn market returns, not **Alpha** (Alpha: excess return, referring to the return of an investment portfolio that outperforms the market benchmark while taking on equivalent risk) from our superior stock-picking ability.</p>
</details>

### 美联储政策与劳动力市场

接下来，我们关注**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行体系）的动态。今天，美联储成员**尼尔·卡什卡利**（Neel Kashkari）发表讲话，市场普遍解读为“放鹰”，导致市场下跌。卡什卡利表示，他不支持上次降息，但对12月份的降息“可支持也可不支持”。这与**鲍威尔**（Jerome Powell）上次调整市场预期时所说的内部存在较大分歧相符，即美联储成员的讲话只是重申了上次会议的分歧，并未带来新的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, let's focus on the dynamics of the **Federal Reserve** (Federal Reserve: the central banking system of the United States). Today, Federal Reserve member **Neel Kashkari** delivered a speech, which the market generally interpreted as "hawkish," leading to a market downturn. Kashkari stated that he did not support the last rate cut but was "open to supporting or not supporting" a rate cut in December. This aligns with what **Jerome Powell** said last time when adjusting market expectations, indicating significant internal divisions. Essentially, the Fed members' speeches merely reiterate the disagreements from the last meeting and offer no new information.</p>
</details>

无论是降息还是不降息，我认为其重要性并不高。卡什卡利也提到，12月和1月（或11月）的政策可能是可替代的。即便本月不降息，美联储也可以释放“鸽派”信号，表示下月可能降息；反之，即便本月降息，也可以释放“鹰派”信号，提高1月份再次降息的门槛。因此，12月份是否降息，在我看来并非关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whether there's a rate cut or not, I believe its importance is not very high. Kashkari also mentioned that the policies for December and January (or November) might be interchangeable. Even if there's no rate cut this month, the Fed could still send "dovish" signals, indicating a potential cut next month; conversely, even if there's a cut this month, they could send "hawkish" signals, raising the bar for another cut in January. Therefore, whether a rate cut happens in December is, in my opinion, not the critical factor.</p>
</details>

更重要的是，如果劳动力市场出现问题，美联储是否有空间去托底。当前经济整体尚无问题，但劳动力市场作为经济的一部分，其状况值得关注。例如，**威瑞森**（Verizon）公司预计未来可能裁员高达2万人，占公司总人数的20%。这表明劳动力市场确实处于放缓过程中，无论是受**AI**影响还是出于增效目的（如**亚马逊**Amazon）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More importantly, if the labor market experiences issues, does the Fed have the room to provide support? Currently, the economy as a whole is not problematic, but the labor market, as part of the economy, warrants attention. For example, **Verizon** announced it might lay off up to 20,000 employees in the future, representing 20% of its workforce. This indicates that the labor market is indeed slowing down, whether due to the impact of **AI** or for efficiency gains (like **Amazon**).</p>
</details>

劳动力市场的最终结果将体现在失业率和非农数据中。如果像**彭博社**（Bloomberg）高频数据在七八月份所显示的，劳动力市场出现反弹，那么美联储可能就不会降息，这说明劳动力市场和经济消费都没有问题。但如果劳动力市场确实有问题，而美联储却不承认并释放“鹰派”信号，市场可能会出现波动。只要美联储有空间且愿意为市场和经济托底，其对市场的影响就不会太大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The ultimate outcome for the labor market will be reflected in unemployment rates and non-farm payroll data. If, as **Bloomberg's** high-frequency data showed in July and August, the labor market rebounds, then the Fed might not cut rates, suggesting no issues with the labor market or economic consumption. However, if the labor market truly has problems, and the Fed denies it while sending "hawkish" signals, the market could experience volatility. As long as the Fed has the room and willingness to support the market and economy, its impact on the market won't be significant.</p>
</details>

最大的风险在于，如果市场反弹时美联储突然释放加息信号，这将彻底改变逻辑。但目前我并未看到任何美联储加息的信号。在这种情况下，无非是降息、延后降息，或者在劳动力市场无问题时选择不降息，有问题时则降息。美联储目前处于一种“自动挡”模式，只要它继续为市场妥协，其对市场的影响就不会非常大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The biggest risk would be if the Fed suddenly signals a rate hike during a market rebound, which would completely change the narrative. But currently, I see no signals indicating a Fed rate hike. In this scenario, it's either a rate cut, a delayed cut, or no cut if the labor market is fine, and a cut if it's problematic. The Fed is currently in an "automatic transmission" mode; as long as it continues to accommodate the market, its impact on the market will not be very large.</p>
</details>

### 迪士尼财报亮点：DTC业务表现

尽管前面讨论了许多市场宏观因素，我今天的重点是**迪士尼**的财报。我非常想分享这份财报，因为它是一个绝佳的例子，说明尽管股价表现不佳，但公司基本面正朝着越来越好的方向发展。对于这类股票，我们应该保持耐心并积极布局。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Despite discussing many macroeconomic market factors earlier, my focus today is on **Disney's** earnings report. I'm very eager to share this report because it's an excellent example of how, even with lackluster stock performance, a company's fundamentals are moving in an increasingly positive direction. For such stocks, we should exercise patience and actively build positions.</p>
</details>

首先来看财报结果：营收体量比市场预期低1.2%，但**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）增速比市场预期高出3.62%。总体而言，这份财报好坏参半。营收不及预期主要来自娱乐（Entertainment）板块，但这并非我特别担忧的领域，因为迪士尼在该板块一直表现强劲，偶尔出现营收不及预期是正常现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, let's look at the earnings results: revenue volume was 1.2% below market expectations, but **EPS** (Earnings Per Share) growth was 3.62% higher than anticipated. Overall, this report was mixed. The revenue miss primarily came from the Entertainment segment, which isn't a major concern for me, as Disney has historically been strong in this area, and occasional revenue misses are normal.</p>
</details>

对我个人而言，迪士尼财报中最受关注的是其**DTC**（Direct-to-Consumer: 直面消费者业务，通常指流媒体服务）流媒体业务，因为这决定了市场未来如何看待迪士尼。核心关注点有两个：一是订阅用户数量，但更重要的是**Margin**（利润率）——即盈利能力和营收增速是否提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me personally, the most scrutinized aspect of Disney's earnings report is its **DTC** (Direct-to-Consumer: direct-to-consumer business, typically referring to streaming services) streaming business, as this will determine how the market views Disney in the future. There are two core focus points: first, subscriber numbers, but more importantly, the **Margin** (profit margin)—that is, whether profitability and revenue growth have improved.</p>
</details>

订阅用户方面，正如我上次所说，此次大概率会好于市场预期，实际结果也高出预期1.25%。从绝对数量上看，市场预期238万人，实际达到400万人，高出100多万，比市场预期高出68%。这表明订阅人数的增长远超预期。此外，**APPU**（Average Revenue Per User: 每用户平均收入）也表现良好，市场预期为7.89美元，实际达到8.04美元，同样超出预期。订阅人数和APPU的双重增长，对于流媒体业务而言是一个非常积极的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding subscribers, as I mentioned last time, it was highly likely to exceed market expectations, and the actual result was indeed 1.25% higher than anticipated. In absolute terms, the market expected 2.38 million subscribers, but the actual figure reached 4 million, exceeding expectations by over 1 million, which is 68% higher than the market's forecast. This indicates subscriber growth far surpassed expectations. Furthermore, **APPU** (Average Revenue Per User: average revenue per user) also performed well, with market expectations at $7.89 and actual results reaching $8.04, also exceeding expectations. The dual growth in subscribers and APPU is a very positive sign for the streaming business.</p>
</details>

如果非要从财报中找一个重点，那无疑是DTC流媒体业务的利润率。我们看到过去四个季度及未来两个季度的利润率分别为4.8%、5.5%（上财年结束的季度）、5.6%（本季度财报）。过去三个季度增速相对缓慢，但下一个季度预计将达到8.2%，再下一个季度为8.1%。公司管理层对2026财年（即将开始的新财年）的预期是，将利润率提升至10%以上，并同时保持营收增速在10%以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If there's one key takeaway from the earnings report, it's undoubtedly the profit margin of the DTC streaming business. We see that over the past four quarters and for the next two quarters, the margins were 4.8%, 5.5% (for the quarter ending the last fiscal year), and 5.6% (for the current earnings report quarter). Growth was relatively slow over the past three quarters, but the next quarter is projected to reach 8.2%, and the quarter after that 8.1%. Company management's guidance for fiscal year 2026 (the new fiscal year about to begin) is to increase the profit margin to over 10% while maintaining revenue growth above 10%.</p>
</details>

试想一下，如果抛开迪士尼其他所有业务，仅看DTC板块：如果**Top Line**（营收增长）能达到10%以上，而**Bottom Line**（净利润增长）的**Margin**能从5.6%提升到10%以上，那么其**Operating Profit**（营业利润）的增速将非常快。当前最新季度营业利润为3.52亿美元，明年其增速有望达到100%甚至更高。因此，DTC业务的利润率提升是我认为迪士尼财报中最亮眼、也最值得关注的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Consider this: if we set aside all other Disney businesses and focus solely on the DTC segment, if **Top Line** (revenue growth) can achieve over 10% growth, and **Bottom Line** (net profit growth) **Margin** can increase from 5.6% to over 10%, then its **Operating Profit** (operating profit) growth will be extremely rapid. With the latest quarter's operating profit at $352 million, its growth next year could potentially reach 100% or even higher. Therefore, the improvement in DTC business profit margin is what I consider the most impressive and noteworthy aspect of Disney's earnings report.</p>
</details>

一旦市场看到迪士尼的利润率真的能达到10%，我相信未来某一天，市场会将迪士尼对标**奈飞**（Netflix）。奈飞的毛利率在30%以上，我认为迪士尼未来有潜力达到这一水平。尽管**Disney+**流媒体业务从2019年至今仅有6年历史，无法与奈飞的悠久历史相提并论，但奈飞无疑是行业内唯一的对标偶像，这意味着迪士尼仍有巨大的上升空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once the market sees Disney's margin truly reach 10%, I believe that one day, the market will benchmark Disney against **Netflix**. Netflix's gross margin is over 30%, and I believe Disney has the potential to reach that level in the future. Although the **Disney+** streaming business has only been around for six years since 2019, it cannot be compared to Netflix's long history, but Netflix is undoubtedly the only benchmark in the industry, which means Disney still has significant upside potential.</p>
</details>

从过去两年管理层的执行力来看，我认为是合格的，虽然并非完美，但公司业务正逐步向好。正如CEO**鲍勃·艾格**（Bob Iger）在财报总结中所说，过去三年迪士尼的平均每年EPS增速达到19%。连续三年19%的EPS增速对于传统价值股而言是很难实现的，这已接近成长股的水平。成长股通常五年盈利翻倍，而19%的增速意味着五年后的盈利将远超翻倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Based on management's execution over the past two years, I believe it has been satisfactory; while not perfect, the company's business is gradually improving. As CEO **Bob Iger** stated in the earnings summary, Disney's average annual EPS growth over the past three years reached 19%. Achieving 19% EPS growth for three consecutive years is very difficult for traditional value stocks, putting it closer to growth stock levels. Growth stocks typically double their earnings in five years, and a 19% growth rate means earnings after five years will be well over double.</p>
</details>

在现金流方面，如果剔除税务等影响，2025财年迪士尼的现金流增速同比达到28%。这使得公司在**派股息**（Dividend Payout: 公司向股东分配利润）的同时还能进行**回购**（Share Buyback: 公司从市场上购回自身股票）。由于内部现金流的改善，明年公司的总回购规模将翻倍，从今年的35亿美元增至70亿美元，股息体量也将比上年提高50%。这些数据都清晰表明，公司内部的**自由现金流**（Free Cash Flow: 公司在支付了所有运营费用和资本支出后，可以自由支配的现金）状况出现了显著改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding cash flow, if we exclude the impact of taxes and other factors, Disney's cash flow growth in fiscal year 2025 increased by 28% year-over-year. This allowed the company to both **pay dividends** (Dividend Payout: distribution of profits by a company to its shareholders) and conduct **share buybacks** (Share Buyback: a company repurchasing its own shares from the market). Due to improved internal cash flow, the total volume of share buybacks next year will double, from $3.5 billion this year to $7 billion, and the dividend payout will also increase by 50% compared to the previous year. These figures clearly indicate a significant improvement in the company's internal **Free Cash Flow** (Free Cash Flow: cash a company has left over after paying all operating expenses and capital expenditures that can be freely distributed).</p>
</details>

### 迪士尼未来展望与估值

在DTC流媒体业务方面，管理层表示目标是保持甚至超过两位数的营收增长。在盈利能力上，他们上次给出的指引也是“两位数”（double digit），即10%以上。考虑到下一个财年第一季度预计利润率为8.2%，第二季度为8.1%，如果全年能达到10%的目标，那么单个季度的利润率很可能超过8%。管理层还补充道，展望2026年以后，他们期望利润率的增长不是几十个基点（0.5%-0.6%）的微幅提升，而是“成块”（in chunk）的、几个百分点的显著提升。这意味着，如果今年利润率最终稳定在5.6%，明年提升到10%，那么2027年及以后可能达到12%、13%甚至15%或更高，逐步向奈飞30%的毛利率靠拢。一旦市场打开这种想象空间，迪士尼流媒体业务的盈利体量甚至可能超越其传统业务。

<p class="english-text">Regarding the DTC streaming business, management stated their goal is to maintain or even exceed double-digit revenue growth. In terms of profitability, their previous guidance was also "double-digit," meaning over 10%. Considering that the first quarter of the next fiscal year is projected to have a profit margin of 8.2%, and the second quarter 8.1%, if the full year can reach the 10% target, then the quarterly profit margin is very likely to exceed 8%. Management also added that looking beyond 2026, they expect margin growth not to be a slight increase of dozens of basis points (0.5%-0.6%), but rather "in chunks," a significant increase of several percentage points. This means that if the margin stabilizes at 5.6% this year and rises to 10% next year, then in 2027 and beyond, it could potentially reach 12%, 13%, or even 15% or higher, gradually approaching Netflix's gross margin of 30%. Once the market opens up this imaginative space, Disney's streaming business's profit volume might even surpass its traditional businesses.</p>

关于未来的想象空间，我做了一些调研。目前，如果你使用迪士尼的APP，已经可以通过**生成式AI**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）来制作内容。在财报会议上，有提问者询问生成式AI未来在迪士尼平台上的应用场景。管理层回应称这是一个非常好的问题，并透露他们已与一些AI公司进行交流。我特意搜索了一下，发现他们可能合作的公司是“Table”。管理层补充说，他们正在寻找利用AI技术增强平台与客户之间粘性的机会。

<p class="english-text">Regarding future imaginative space, I conducted some research. Currently, if you use the Disney APP, you can already create content using **Generative AI** (Generative AI: artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media content). During the earnings call, a questioner asked about future use cases for Generative AI on Disney's platform. Management responded that it was an excellent question and revealed they had already been in discussions with some AI companies. I specifically searched and found that the company they might be collaborating with is "Table." Management added that they are looking for opportunities to use AI technology to enhance the stickiness between the platform and its customers.</p>

通过研究“Table”这家公司的视频，我大致理解了其应用方向。如果你去迪士尼乐园，会发现体验和互动是核心，尤其与**NPC**（Non-Player Character: 非玩家角色，指游戏或虚拟世界中的非真人角色）的交流。生成式AI的未来应用可能很简单，例如，一个孩子可以与屏幕上的卡通人物进行对话，卡通人物会以其特有的声音回应。对话内容会有所限制，以确保其适合儿童。这使得迪士尼的卡通人物能够通过虚拟方式与孩子们互动，增强体验。未来结合VR或投影技术，这种体验可能会更加逼真。这只是当前的想象空间，具体的变现模式尚不明确，但关键在于生成式AI如何赋能迪士尼的**IP**（Intellectual Property: 知识产权），这是公司未来需要思考的重要方向，也是一个极具潜力的业务。

<p class="english-text">By watching videos from "Table," I broadly understood its application direction. If you visit Disney theme parks, you'll find that experience and interaction are core, especially with **NPCs** (Non-Player Character: non-player characters, referring to non-human characters in games or virtual worlds). The future application of Generative AI could be simple; for example, a child could converse with a cartoon character on screen, and the character would respond in its unique voice. The conversation content would be limited to ensure it's suitable for children. This allows Disney's cartoon characters to interact virtually with children, enhancing the experience. In the future, combining VR or projection technology could make this experience even more immersive. This is just current imaginative space; specific monetization models are not yet clear, but the key lies in how Generative AI can empower Disney's **IP** (Intellectual Property: intellectual property), which is an important direction for the company to consider in the future and a highly potential business.</p>

最后是迪士尼的估值。市场预期2026财年迪士尼的EPS增速为10%，管理层在财报会议中也给出了“两位数”的指引，恰好是10%的最低端。因此，2026财年管理层很有可能实现比市场预期更好的表现。目前，迪士尼的**P/E**（Price/Earnings Ratio: 市盈率）约为18倍。如果根据市场预期，未来三年EPS增速分别为10%、11%和9%，那么三年后其P/E将降至13.74倍。从我个人角度看，迪士尼目前的估值偏低。

<p class="english-text">Finally, there's Disney's valuation. The market expects Disney's EPS growth for fiscal year 2026 to be 10%, and management also provided "double-digit" guidance in the earnings call, which is precisely the lower end of 10%. Therefore, it's highly probable that management will achieve better performance than market expectations for fiscal year 2026. Currently, Disney's **P/E** (Price/Earnings Ratio: price-to-earnings ratio) is about 18 times. If, based on market expectations, EPS growth for the next three years is 10%, 11%, and 9% respectively, then its P/E will drop to 13.74 times after three years. From my personal perspective, Disney's current valuation is undervalued.</p>

有趣的是，我关注迪士尼这家公司已有多年，从疫情时期开始持有至今，总浮盈约25%-27%。然而，同期标普500指数上涨了50%多，远超迪士尼的涨幅，两者差距约30个百分点。但我关注的并非它能否跑赢标普，我相信它未来能够跑赢标普甚至许多个股。只是目前市场尚未看到或不认同其价值，因此给予了相对较低的估值。从基本面投资和价值投资的角度出发，如果我认为一家公司的基本面，特别是管理层，正朝着我期待的方向发展，我愿意给予其时间。我相信未来有一天，市场会看到这家公司的真正价值。

<p class="english-text">Interestingly, I have been following Disney for many years, holding it since the pandemic, with a total unrealized gain of about 25%-27%. However, during the same period, the S&P 500 index rose by over 50%, far outperforming Disney, with a difference of about 30 percentage points. But what I focus on is not whether it can outperform the S&P; I believe it will outperform the S&P and even many individual stocks in the future. It's just that the market currently hasn't recognized or agreed with its value, thus giving it a relatively low valuation. From the perspective of fundamental investing and value investing, if I believe a company's fundamentals, especially its management, are moving in the direction I expect, I am willing to give it time. I believe that one day, the market will recognize the true value of this company.</p>
