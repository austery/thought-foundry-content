### 地缘政治信号：达尔文港与巴拿马港口事件的深层解读

本次节目因流感延期，但我们仍将探讨一个重要议题。近期，两则看似独立的事件——澳大利亚收回达尔文港的租赁权，以及巴拿马最高法院宣布 Hutchison Port Holdings 的港口协议违宪——揭示了全球正在经历的深刻变革。演讲者认为，这些事件并非简单的商业纠纷，而是人类社会正悄然从一个基于既定规则的和平时代，转向一个“战前状态”的信号，在这个新阶段，规则依然存在，但优先事项需要重新确立。中国（CCP）在国际事务中的某些行为将面临更严峻的审视、评判乃至围堵。

hello，
everyone。
welcome to cork says，
i'm core。
i apologized for the delay。
this episode was originally planned for last weekend，
but it was postponed due to the flu。
however，
our channel isn't primarily a news channel。
so after careful consideration，
i decided to still complete this topic。
on january twenty eight，
a piece of news broke that was quite unfavorable to the CCP australian prime minister。
albany stated that for national security reasons，
australiacommitted to reclaiiming，
the darwin port，
which was leased to chineinese company，
ninety nine years and bringing it back under australian control。
the chinese sides response was quite intriguing shelchian。
the chinese ambassador to australia merely stated that he would protect chinese legitimate interest overseas and hope that the issue would be properperresresved ved as monstate ate australia's welcoming attitude towards ineineinveinvement。
it didn't seem as confronfrontational as one might expect just one day later。
on the other side of the world，
the supreme court of panama announced the concession agreement for two port signed in nineteen ninety ty by huhutchsson port holdings，
a subsidiary of lecochshsing CK hutchson holdings was illegal and temporarily placed under the management of merse group。
didn't the CCP keep pressuingly caushing over the port issue。
now it seems the dust has settled。
panama has effectively ended the deal from the ground up，
no matter how much the CCP complains。
ts useless hutchsson can still pursue international arbitration and may received some compensation，
but the c CP attempmpto exert pressure on lee ak ushame to gain control of these two ports has essentially failed。
if you consider these two events as isolated incidents and ordinary business disputes，
then you might be greatly underestimating the changes that are silently taking place in our society。
in this episode，
i want to discuss these port events，
especially the darwin port issue and a reality that the win in have sociebut，
but has quietly taken shape。
whether human society has already entered a prewar state that the silchological and institutional levels let's start with a darwin port incident。
嗯，
if you search for related chinese keywords，
you'll see a deluge of reports on the darwin port incident，
mostly condemning the australian government for not honouring the contract in portraing，
china as completely innocent。
however，
more details are australimissing regarding why the australian government did this，
the geocrual al maneuvring involved and even crucial information such as the locacial darwin port，
and it's importortant clearly doesn't help us understand the full picture。

### 达尔文港的战略地位与潜在风险

达尔文港位于澳大利亚北部领地的首府达尔文市，是澳大利亚北部最重要的战略港口，其战略地位堪比澳大利亚的“北方门户”。该港口拥有天然深水条件，航道宽阔，可全天候容纳大型军舰、补给舰和登陆舰，且无需频繁疏浚，这对于海军的高频进出至关重要。相比之下，其他北部的港口如巴布亚新几内亚和所罗门群岛的港口则较为浅小，仅能作为前沿哨所。

达尔文港还拥有北部澳大利亚最完善的空、铁、公、海联运设施。一旦发生战争，陆地部队、弹药和备件可从澳大利亚大陆持续运往太平洋战场。因此，这里是美澳联合部队理想的集结、维护、补给和前沿部署基地。二战期间，日军曾在此发动大规模空袭，足见其战略要冲地位。

目前，达尔文港附近集结了澳大利亚皇家海军的HMAS Coonawarra海军基地、皇家空军基地以及陆军的Robertson Barracks 和 Larrakeyah Barracks，并且是美军陆战队的驻地。然而，控制着达尔文港两个关键港口——East Arm 和 Fort Hill（意为要塞山）的，却是中国公司 **Landbridge Group**。这家公司与中国（CCP）的紧密联系，以及长达九十九年的租赁协议，引发了澳大利亚政府的极大担忧。

let me add some background information。
darwin port is located in darwin，
the capital of australia's northern territory。
it is the most important strategic port in north in australia，
holding a unique position among australi's seventeen national level important ports equivalent to australia's northern gateway。
it is also the only city in australia to have experience cmodern warfare，
the famous darwin port arraade during world war ti took place here at that time，
japanese forces launch more than one hundred arraies on military in civilian facilities in the port over a period of more than a year。
from this，
you can understand how important its strategic position is looking at the map alone。
it seems that the islands of popuwin ughini and the solomon islands are further north。
but from a military perspective，
the valtime view of darwin port far outweighs these two locations。
firstly，
darwin port is a natural deep water port with good draft in channel conditions，
capable of accommodating large warships，
supply ships and ethhibious assault ships year ound without obstruction and without requiring frequendredging。
what does this mean for the navy？
it means that warships can continuously enter an excited，
high frequency。
in contrast，
pop in uininy in the solomon islands are shallow small ports within inherently insufficient birth，
capcapacand and fpid id，
so they can only service forward out posts and cannot fulfill the central role。
requiire in milmilitary base。
kdarwin port has has most complepleairairport railway，
ghway and port facilities in northern australia。
this means ans，
once 's war，
breaks out roops s el ammunition and spare parts can be continuously ly ansported from mainland australia and deploy to the ppific battlefield。
this location is naturally the best assembly maintenance supply in staging base for the US australian joint forces。
this is why the japanese army spent。
so much effort attacking this place during the war，
understanding this background，
you can now easily understand this map。
located next to darwin international airport is the royal australian air force base，
and here's the hmas cnooar，
a naval base。
finally，
roberts and byrics houses the army，
all branches of a military are present，
army navy and airforfornote that these three bases are all red red by the us in australian forces，
and roberts and baricx is also home to the US marine poore。
so where are the two ports that have sparked controversy，
both under the extreme control of the chinese own company language there？
here，
one is，
is called estarm，
and the others called fill，
which can be translated as fortss hill or fortified hill。
because histically，
it was the location of a battery and observation post。
let me think about this。
the only two ports near your most important military basase are controlled by a foreign company。
but not just any foreign company，
but china and an xis power that is highly likely to launch a foreign ar in in the future。
they've ve sigsigned a ty nine year lesaagreement。
if you were the australian government，
how would you feel？
in fact，
you don't even need to be a military expert。
anyone with basic military knowledge knows how high the risks are，
you don't even need to wait until the war starts the prewar preparations alone or enough to make the australian government extremely apprehensive。
firstly，
there's the risk of electronic vulnerability。
if US australian naval vessels leave the base，
they must pass through the shipping lane opposite east arm，
which is controlled by language。
this means that for ninety nine years，
the US is most crucial military units from nuclear submarines to aircraft carriers will be subjects to continues monitoring by the CCP every time they sell out or return to port。
the CCP only needs to install so ar listening in signal interception equipment in the dot towers or ships，
and the acoustic signature and electronic frequencies of US naval vessels will be completely transparent to the CCP。
secondly，
there's the delay in operations。
modern warfare relies on logistics and timing if a conflict truly errups in the south china sea or the taiwan straight darwin court is the lifeline for the US coalition。
if at that time，
language uses port maintenance equipment failure or commercial contract disputes as reasons to implement a legal and compliant soft blockade，
or even create technical obstacles in key shipping lanes，
then the urgently needed ammunition and fuel with the front lines might have to wait in definitely。
and this doesn't even account for the even more in cdiast data collection。
currently，
the entire ports automated management system and all material flow data are under their control。
this means that every movement of the coalition forces in the northern territory，
every crease or decrease in supplies is completely transparent to them。
considering these three points，
you'll find that this chinese mil has effectively crippled the military function of darwin port。
the most important base in norern australia rendering，
it virtually useless。

### 商业逻辑的缺失与国家安全的优先考量

有人可能认为，Landbridge 仅是一家私营公司，其行为与 CCP 无关。然而，任何在中国注册运营并受其控制的公司，都无法拒绝党的任何指令，包括军事渗透。将 Landbridge 的行为视为纯粹的商业交易是自欺欺人。

从纯粹的商业角度审视，Landbridge 对达尔文港的投资并不合理。澳大利亚人口高度集中在东南部沿海地区，北部地区人口稀少，特别是达尔文所在的北领地，人口密度极低。这种人口分布与澳大利亚严酷的自然地理环境（内陆干旱、沿海湿热）密切相关。达尔文港的年吞吐量仅为4500万吨，远低于澳大利亚东南部港口，商业价值有限。即使考虑将进口货物从北部转运至东南部，高昂的铁路或公路运输成本也使其不具备经济可行性。

对于矿产等大宗商品，澳大利亚的主要矿产资源（铁矿石、煤炭）分布在西澳大利亚和东海岸，当地已有成熟的港口进行出口，将货物运往达尔文再出口的成本效益极低。达尔文港的价值更多体现在军事物流而非商业运营。在军事逻辑中，成本效益并非首要考量；一旦发生冲突，从达尔文港快速部署兵力或物资，可能比其他港口节省关键的一到两天时间。

Landbridge 在2015年以超过25倍的 EV/EBITDA 估值（远高于行业平均的8-12倍）收购达尔文港，这笔交易在商业上极不寻常，暗示其背后存在非商业动机。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
some might say that even if the risk you mention exist，
it doesn't prove it。
it will necessarily happen。
after all，
language is just a private company。
it's just a simple commercial transaction。
regarding this question，
we can look at it from free perspectives。
firstly，
even the most naive western politician knows that there is no truly in the in private enterprise in china。
any company registered in operating in china，
with its controlling interest in china cannot refuse any demands from the party，
including military infiltration in state level。
espianauage saying that because it's a private company，
it might not be controlled by the CCP is like saying that always selling equipment to iran and helping them build a surveillance system。
risking US sanctions is purely a commercial transaction unrelated to the CCP。
it's simply self deception。
secondly，
let's look at the data。
let's see if language es investment is a sound business decision from a peure commercial perspective。
this is a population density map of australia from the map。
we can see that the vast majority of australia's population is concentrated in the southeeastern coastal area。
in fact，
the major cities with the largest populations in australia，
sydney，
melbourourne，
canberra，
brisbane and adelaide basically ally located in adelagide。
the only exception is locath，
with two point three eight million people located in the southwest corner of australia，
the northern territory where darwin is located the northe areas with with lowest population density in australia，
and indeed，
the entire western world，
with one point three，
five million square kilometre of land。
it only has two hundred sixty eight people，
eequivalent zero hundred eight people per square kilometre，
which one one eighteen of the australian average。
this might not give you much context。
it's roughly equivalent to the entire city of shanghai only having just over one thousand residents。
furthermore，
over one hundred sixty thousand of these two hundred thousand people are crammed into the capital city of darwin。
outside of darwin，
you have to drive more than one thousand five hundred kilometers to encounter the first decent human settlement。
the reason for such a skiled population distribution is inextricably link to australia's harsh，
natural and geographical environment。
looking at a map of australia，
you'll see that the entire city and it resembles a hollow dona。
the vast interior is dry ry barn，
red det desert。
and the only area is susuitable for human haititation along ong cocoast。
the southestern coast is particularly favoured because of a mountain range，
spending thousands of kilometres called the great dividing range represented by the black line on the map。
this mountain range blocks，
the moist air from the southern pacific othe trapping rainfall in the southeast corner，
resulting in furtal soil in a suitable temperate climate。
对对对，
now，
you understand why sydney in melbourne are located along this line，
as for the northern territory，
where darwin is located the lack of mountains in its tropical savanet and monsoon climate，
with only two seasons，
a dry season that scorching hot in a wet season with torortial rain and devastating。
cyclones makes 没有法有的事的事有没有意见？
it unsuitable for large scale agriculture，
or is the location for a major urban centre。
this is why，
despite being further north darwin has a small population。
this also explains why，
as mentioned earlier，
darw's port has a very low commercial ceiling ports and logistics revolve around people。
sufficient population is necessary for cargo throurouput and port profitability，
while a port on a southeasterstern coast serves millions of people。
darwin only serves a few hundred thousand，
so the cargo volume and commercial value or not，
even in the same leguing fact，
according to official australian statistics，
darwin ports annual fruit is is only forty five million tonns ranking eighteen to twenty in australia，
less than one percent of the number one rank port headland，
some might think isn't darwin port further north couldn't imported goods，
be unloaded there，
and then transported by rail and road to the more populated cities in the southeast。
嗯，
quobut。
but if understand logistics，
SA，
simple，
callalation will show that this idea is prpractical。
taking a standard container is an example。
the shipping cost from major chinese ports such as ninboo，
porand shanghai poport to sydney brisbane or darwin port is approximately six to seven cents australian dollars per kilogram。
why is it that the shipping costs is similar，
even though the sea roote to sydney is thousands of kilometers longer than to darwin？
this，
though the shipping cost are not only related ted didibut，
but also to a series of other factors such as poor charges，
customoms clearance，
where housing，
including port fruit，
and turn over efficiency for two ports of similar distance。
if one has a huge fruit receives large ships，
and the ships are always fully loaded，
and the poris almost most iddoperpertwenty twenty hours，
a cowhich。
the the cost cost from that port will be cheaper。
therefore，
the shipping cost from major in port ts along the southeastern coast，
or often lower than those from darwin porport。
then after the goods arrive at darwin pod the cheapest way to transport them to sydney or brisbane，
would be by adding another three thousand kilometers of railway transportation costs，
which works out to twtwelve fourteen cents australian dollars per kilogram。
if it's by road transport，
the costs would increase around twenty eight cents。
the shipping costs for these two options are three and five times higher，
respectively，
then the direct shipping cost from shanghai to sydney。
now mister president，
you understand why i said the darwin ports commercial value is actually very low。
some people might think that ordinary goods are not suitable，
but could darwin porport handle boke commodities such as minerals and energy，
australia duproduprodued iron war oil and coal。
doesn't it？
yes，
but even considering these darwins location is still very awkward as shown in the map of australia's main mineral distribution。
have you noticed australia's most valuable mineral iron oore is mainly distributed in the pull barrow region of western australia。
australia's two largest ports，
porhehetland and ammper porport are also located in this region。
secondly，
coal minds are distributed along the southasterone coast in new south wales in queensland。
the coal minind here can be transported to newcastle in glass stone，
ports rank third in six perpectively，
just a few hundred kilometers to the east。
similarly，
there's no need to spend several times to shipping costs to transport goods to darwin，
thousands of kilometers away。
and what does darwin port have to offer only small amount of locally produced liquified natural gas from the norern territory？
this volume is negligible compared to the colossal ports in western australia，
which handle hundreds of millions of tons of cargo。
therefore，
from a purely commercial perspective，
darwin port is actually very inefficient when we say it's an important port in in northern australiwe're。
actually referring to its value in military logistics，
because according to military logic，
the highest priority is never cost the effectiveness。
if a conflict breaks out in the south china，
a in east china sea and the US intervenes quickly deploying fleets and military supplies to the front lines from darwin port could save at least one to two days compared to other ports in the southwest，
whether it's a large transport aircraft like the sea，
seventeen or obamer like the b two departing from darwin porport without refueling，
they can easily cover the first or even the second island chain，
departing from other ports on the eastern west sides would be much more difficult。
understanding this，
when you review the bating motives of the language group back，
then doesn't it seem quite suspicious？
looking at the financial statements，
you'll find it from twenty twelve to twenty fifteen before language group took over。
darwin ports annual net profit was quite table around less than twenty million australian dollars。
however，
language es winning bid price in twenty fifteen was five hundred six million australian dollars。
let me briefly explained it for acid projects like ports and airports。
the usual valuation method is to use EV enterprise value diknow ded by you biid the earning before before interest texis，
deticiation and imvertization for the past year。
you don't need to remember this concept just know that it's a way of calculating profit。
this multiple basically tells you whether your acquisition pris higher。
so what was this this llple ple when land dge dge quired it over twenty five times under normal circumstances，
the valuation of such projects is around eight to twelve times。
in other words，
language paid more than twice the fair price。
how exaggerated is this multiple for comparison in twenty pertwenty times after leacauhing hutch's imports company was selling its global poort assets，
the multiple offered was looteen times。
this already noting that many count the acquisition price offered worwornonoted many chchinese media outlets incluonly official CCP mediclaimed ed。
the forof ddarwin was losing money before language to over and only became profitable after language suppporquisition。
they also claimed that the australian government was being unfair in trying to read benefits for lanverage now and so on。
this statement is actually untrue。
the reality is that the port of darwin was already profitable before language took over。
this rhetoric is merely intended to create public pressure and increase their bargaining power。
therefore，
looking back at the twenty fifteen bidding process，
only two scenarios can explain languages behavior。
first languages management was foolish。
second，
they had terior motives and more interested in much more than just commercial profits。

### 政治盲点与国家主权的代价

澳大利亚政府在2015年批准Landbridge收购达尔文港，其背后存在政治上的“致命盲点”和战略误判。当时的北领地政府财政拮据，急需资金升级港口，而联邦政府的监管政策存在漏洞：州或领地政府直接将资产出售给外国投资者，只要不涉及核心国家安全领域，联邦政府就无权干预。尽管达尔文港靠近军事基地，但其性质被界定为民用港口。

此外，当时澳大利亚仍沉浸在中澳关系“黄金十年”的氛围中，对CCP的真实意图判断失误，未能预见到其“隐藏实力、伺机而动”策略的转变。CCP正是利用了西方国家地方政府财政困难和政策漏洞，通过签署长期租赁协议并支付高价，逐步渗透关键基础设施。达尔文港的案例，以及CCP在全球范围内控制港口的模式（如希腊的比雷埃夫斯港），都显示了其战略规划的一致性。2015年的交易，成为澳大利亚因政治幼稚而付出的昂贵主权与安全代价。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
some might wonder since the chinese companies intended tions in that acquisition were so obvious。
how did it pass smoothly in the first place was the australian government stupid here。
we have to mention a fatal blind spot in australian politics at the time，
and the almost naive strategic misjudgment of the CC reregime the world at large。
first，
we need to understand australia's unique political structure in australia，
state and territory。
governments have considerable autonomy，
not only fifteen。
the northern territory government was extremely poor，
not only burden with huge debt，
but also facing a severe funding gap for urgently needed upgrades to the port of barwin。
there。
thinking at the time was since the federal government woulproviprovide undundthey would sell assets。
however，
there was a huge policy loople in federal regulations at the time according to the law，
then if an asset was sold directly to foreign investors by stator territory government，
the feal al had had no right to intervene，
as long as it didn't involve core national security areas。
although the port of darwin was close to three military basis，
it was technically a civilian port and did not belong to three department of defence。
furthermore，
australian politics at the time was still basking in the africa of the golden decade of sigal australian relations，
and the CCP was still hearing to denin shopping in johs them in policicof of hiding scapabilities and biiting。
its time not fully revealing its true intentions。
most stern countries，
including australia，
still only considered a business partner and completely failed to anticipated subsequent comprehenve notification。
this gave the language group a perfect window of of opportunity。
in fact，
the party state is leveraging control over ports from hbbanota in three lunge to parrae。
in greece and then to darwin port。
the methods are identical first exexloloiting oppoles in western countries，
policies from local government's finances。
they sign nineteen nine year leases at exororbin prices。
you might think a big full is coming，
but little do know they are strategically planning minds in your backyard。
this includes the fourth transfer of keyports from lecaashing to chinese styed on enterprises last year，
which was a concrete example of this scheme，
although it didn't fully succeed the subsequent changes in the situation over the next few years，
completely awaken ened australians was with a changing times chinese diplatic style shift ted，
an aggressive wololwar，
a mode miltarization of south china sea and the outbreak of the final US trayward。
the australian government suddenly realized that the chinese neighbor who had been operating in their backyard for nearly ten years，
had actually installed a camera in their bedroom。
it can be said that this twenty fifteen transaction was an expensive lesson learned by australian sovereigty and security for its political naivity。
the australian government's current response is essentially ability attempt to address the security black hole left by that geopolitical immaturity。

### 契约精神的界限：国家安全优先于商业合同

关于澳大利亚政府单方面终止合同的争议，需要区分“违约”与“缺乏契约精神”。商业合同本身包含退出机制，如提前终止条款。若一方成为威胁国家安全的“窃贼”，如同房东发现租客安装了窃听设备，优先保护自身安全而提前终止合同，并支付相应赔偿，这并非背弃契约精神。

国家安全评估遵循的是“预防性逻辑”，而非事后追责。即使没有确凿证据证明 Landbridge 明确进行了间谍活动，但其存在本身构成了战时可预见的重大风险，就必须被消除。这与战场上的逻辑类似：和平时期司法追求公正，而战时或国家安全层面，首要目标是确保生存。例如，面对可能威胁国家存亡的核弹失窃，不能因“无确凿证据”而放任不管。

澳大利亚政府公开披露其监控 Landbridge 系统后门的方法，将直接暴露其情报能力。因此，国家安全决策的透明度受到限制。国家生存权和宪法存在是履行所有商业合同的前提；当两者发生冲突时，国家安全优先。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
now let's talk about the third point one，
some argugue，
while lldley's might indebe helping the CCP with s sponoage，
there is still no conclusive evidence。
how can the australian government unilaterally convicicsomeone and terminate the contract without concrete evidence？
what about judicial independence and the spirit of contract？
this needs to be discussed in two parts，
starting with the contract。
first，
let's correct a misconception。
many believe that any contract violation means a lack of adhearance to the contract。
this is wrong because breach of contract is itself part of the exit mechanism of a commercial contract。
for example，
you open a restaurant in sign a ten year lease，
but the restaurant goes bankrupt in the first year，
and you have to terminate the lease。
can the landlord say you can't terminate the lease and must run for ten years。
otherwise，
you lack the spirit of contract。
obviously，
none，
because the contract definitely includes an early termination clause。
you just have to pay compensation only if you terminate the least and refuse to pay the liquidity damages。
can you be considered to lack the spirit of contract？
imagine the lee o arriving in darwin，
australia。
it's like a landlord renting to attenant only defined out half way through the least that detenant is a ief and a covert，
installing hidden cameras and listening devices in the house in this situation。
would you still insist on waiting until the end of the least to take action，
especially if it's a long term lease，
you would definitely rather break the lease early and get rid of them。
you would the safety of your family is paramount。
secondly，
there's the issue conconiciction。
we know know that a typical judicial context。
the principle is that a person is ininnocent told proven guilty。
ty can't lock someone up just because you suspect they committed murder。
however，
national security assessments are not typical situations。
they follow a preventative logic，
not post event。
accountability。
simply put，
i don't need to prove what bluebridge explicitly did as long as their existence poses a significant risk of causing a exasurable damage and warar time，
then the threat must be eliminated。
now some might think this is too arbitrary。
normally，
courts require evidence in procedure。
when trying cases，
why is national security example from these rules？
if you think that way，
let me ask you a question under the legal systems of china，
the united states or any normal country，
you can't commit murder，
right？
if you commit murder，
you'll go to jail，
even be executed，
right？
so why is it that in a battlefield situation？
killing is not only unpunished，
but even celebrated as heroism。
because in peace time，
the judicial system is designed around the goal of achieving justice，
but in wartime，
including the logic of national security，
the primary goal is to ensure survival。
what does that mean？
let me give you an easy to understand example，
suppose you encounter a theft case involving one thousand dollars。
there's a suspect who is very likely the thief，
but there's insufficient evidence。
in this case，
you can't use the presumption of guilt because you might wrongly convict in innocent person。
so we'd rather risk losing one thousand dollars and letting a criminal go free，
you can afford that risk。
but what if the stolen item was a superpowerful nuclear bomb capable of destroying the entire country and the thief intends to sell it to a terrorist organization？
would you still say that to avoid wrongly convicting an innocent person，
you let them go or even refuse to search their basement out of respect for their privacy？
they certait ly wouldn't there？
because if it really was their fault，
no one could bear the potential consequences。
this is the logic of national security。
to what extent can this national security logic go to the point that i don't need to disclose exactly what financial control methods were used against language as in ordeninly judal。
if i say it is，
then it is if i say there there re's a risk，
then there's a risk。
because if the australian government publicly revealed in court，
how we monitor the back door in the language system，
it would be tent amount to directly telling our opponents when my monitoring methods or and where my intelligence sources come from，
many people think that a country of contracts refers to peace time and is not include exceptional circumstances because the right to national survival and the existence of the constitution or prerequiisits for the fulffilment of all commercial contracts。

### 国家安全定义的差异：中共与西方模式的对比

有人担心澳大利亚政府采取的行动与中共以国家安全为名进行“红色恐怖”的行为相似。然而，两者存在本质区别。

首先，**国家安全**的定义范围不同。CCP口中的国家安全涵盖范围极广，从发布微博到银行取款都可能被纳入，其核心是维护党的统治和绝对权威，这是一种“政权安全”，而非真正的国家安全。而西方国家（如美国、澳大利亚）的国家安全审查是**外向型**的，针对的是具有竞争关系的外国政治力量，重点关注关键基础设施和战略节点，而非普通公民的财产。澳大利亚政府收回达尔文港，但不会随意没收悉尼街头中国商人的住宅。

其次，**监督机制**不同。在中国，政府认定某人为间谍即可将其逮捕，律师也可能受牵连。但在澳大利亚，即使是国家安全措施也需接受整个司法系统的审视。政府不能仅凭一份文件就随意没收港口，反对党会监督其是否出于政治目的，媒体会放大审视其操作是否合法，最重要的是，独立的司法系统允许 Landbridge 集团提起诉讼并获得赔偿的可能性。

尽管如此，任何国家，包括澳大利亚这样的民主国家，在国家安全名义下都可能面临权力滥用的风险，尤其是在当前地缘政治紧张和战争风险加剧的背景下。这是必须正视的系统性张力。

isn't the CCP also using the pretext of national security to engage in red terrotactics in china are trailly ly resting for alleged crimes are confiscating perpersonal assets。
but if your australian government is the same thing，
what's the difference between you in china？
there is a difference and a very big one。
first。
the scope of the definition of security is different。
the national security in the CCP 's reheoric is a broad category。
anything from posting a webo message to withdrawing money from a bank can be included。
their logic，
is that anything that might be detrimental to the party's rule or absoluthority can be considered a national security issue。
this kind of logic is inwardly focused used against its own people。
it's not national security，
but rather regime security。
however，
the national security review in countries like the US in australia is ouwardly focused it target specific for in political forces with which they have a competitive relationship。
you may find that the australian government might cease darwin port，
but it wwon't confiscate the warehouse or home of any ordinary chinese businessman on the streets of sydney and boundaries are very strstrict fic，
a spacts critical infrastructure instrategic nodes。
secondly，
who supervise susupervisers in china，
the government says you 're a spy。
you can even find a lawyer，
even even lawyer might become a spy。
but in australia，
this form of national seficity still still has to withstand scrutiny from the entire judicial system。
the australian government cannot simply seize the port by issuing a red document。
the opposition party will be watching to see if you engaging in political pportunism。
and the media will be scrutiiing you with the magnifying glass to see if you engage in illegal operations or excessive enforcement。
most importantly，
the independent judicial system is ffunctioning，
and the bluebridge group can still sue the australian government in federal court and is highly likely to receive compensation。
of course，
having said that，
i must admit that any country，
including established democracies like australia，
may face the risk of the government abusing its power under the pretext of national security。
this is especially true with the continued international geopolitical tensions and the increasing risk of war。
but this is a systemic tension that we must enr at the end of this program。

### 从和平时代到战前状态的全球转型

从达尔文港到巴拿马港口事件，都提醒我们一个严峻的现实：人类社会正从一个基于既定规则的和平时代，过渡到一个“战前状态”。在这个新时代，规则依然存在，但国家生存和安全将成为首要考量。

CCP 的一些行为将面临前所未有的审视和围堵。这种趋势并非由某位特定领导人的政策所驱动，而是全球地缘政治格局变化的必然结果。欧洲、加拿大、澳大利亚等国，即使在政治上可能与某些政策存在分歧，但在面对国家安全威胁时，它们都清楚谁是真正的潜在对手。

i want to say that from darwin port to panama，
everything reminds us of a cold hard reality。
the human world is a whole is transitioning from a peaceful era based on estaclish rules to a prewar state where rules still exist，
but priorities need to be establish。
some of the CCP 's actions will face increasing scrutiny judgment and even in circlement。
in the future。
this trend cannot be changed by what some people called trumps actions，
the angered western allies and aided shejumping。
simply put，
whether it's europe，
canada or australia。
they may superficially disagree with trump。
but when it comes to national security，
they all know who the real enemy is that needs to be guarded against。
okay，
that's offer today's program。
if you have any questions，
please leave me a message or send me an email see you next time。
