### 情人节浪漫故事征集

**Anna**: 大家好，我是 **Anna**。在节目开始前，我想聊聊**情人节**，因为《**现代爱情**》（**Modern Love**）栏目组已经在筹备了。我们希望得到大家的帮助：想知道发生在你们身上，或者你们亲眼目睹过的最浪漫的事。它可以是像浪漫喜剧那样宏大的场面，比如有人举着收音机站在你窗外，或者在机场狂奔拦下即将离开的你；也可以是微小的小事，比如某人知道你讨厌橄榄，所以在你动筷子前就把它们从你盘子里挑走；或者每天早上在你的午餐盒里塞一张纸条，提醒你有多重要。无论是惊天动地的瞬间，还是细微的点滴，只要让你感受到了浪漫的冲击，我们都想听听，并了解为什么它对你而言如此浪漫。如果你有故事，请在 2 月 4 日前录制一段语音备忘录，发送至 modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com。期待听到你们的故事。

**Anna**: Hey everyone, it's Anna. All right, before we start the show, I want to talk about Valentine's Day because of course we are already thinking about it over here at Modern Love. We're hoping you can help us out. We want to know the most romantic thing that's ever happened to you. Or if it didn't happen to you, the most romantic thing you've ever seen or witnessed. It could be something grand, a romcom style gesture. Maybe someone stood outside your window with a boom box or ran through the airport to stop you from leaving. Or it could be something small like someone knows you hate olives, so they always pick them off your plate before you dig in. Or someone slips a note in your lunchbox every morning to remind you how much you mean to them. Whatever made you feel that rush of romance from the big moments to the tiny ones, we want to hear about it and we want to know why it was so romantic to you. If you have a story in mind, record a voice memo and email it to us at modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com by February 4th and we might use your story on the show. That's modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com. And once again, your deadline is February 4th. Thanks so much. We can't wait to hear from you.

### 重新审视男性气概

**Anna**: 我是 **Anna Martin**，这里是《现代爱情》。大家可能还记得，不久前我们邀请过作家 **Sam Graham Felson**。他曾讲述过在意识到成年后的孤独后，如何努力与生命中的其他男性重拾友谊。那次对话充满了温柔与脆弱，是对**男性气概**（**Masculinity**）的一次令人惊讶的反思。所以当我看到 Sam 的新文章，主题竟然是关于如何让他的儿子变得“**强悍**”（**Tough**）时，我感到有些意外。强悍？这听起来非常传统意义上的男性化。我想知道这对他意味着什么。今天，Sam 回到了节目中，讲述他带着 8 岁的儿子前往全美公路旅行，去体验“**奋斗的人生**”（**Strenuous Life**）的故事，以及为什么他认为强悍对儿子如此重要，而儿子又反过来教会了他什么。Sam，欢迎回到《现代爱情》。

**Anna**: From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. So, you might remember a while back we had the writer Sam Graham Felson on the show. He told us all about trying to rekindle his old friendships with other men in his life after he realized that as an adult he felt pretty lonely. That conversation was so full of tenderness and vulnerability and such a surprising reflection on masculinity that honestly I was a little surprised when I saw a new article from Sam pop up all about trying to make his son tough. I was like tough? Tough? Really? That sounds so traditionally masculine. I didn't expect it coming from Sam and I really wanted to know what it meant to him. So today, Sam is back to tell us what happened when he took his 8-year-old son on a cross-country road trip to live the strenuous life, why toughness felt like such an important thing for a son to learn, and what his son taught him in return. Sam Graham Felson, welcome back to Modern Love.

</details>

**Sam**: 很高兴能回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: It's really fun to be back.

</details>

**Anna**: Sam，你为《**纽约时报杂志**》写了一篇新文章，标题叫《**我试图让儿子变强悍，但计划赶不上变化**》。这笑声背后一定有很多故事。我们待会再聊发生了什么，但首先我想知道，你为什么觉得你儿子需要变得强悍？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Sam, the last time we had you on the show, you'd written this big New York Times magazine story about friendship between men. Now, you've written another piece for the magazine. The story is called "I Tried to Toughen Up My Son. Things Didn't Go As Planned." There's a lot behind that laugh. We'll get into what happened, but first, I want to know why. Why did you think your son needed to be tough?

</details>

**Sam**: 我儿子真的让我看到了小时候的自己。我很敏感，有非常狂热的爱好，你可以说我是个“**书呆子**”。和我儿子不同的是，我那时极度渴望变得“酷”，所以我强迫自己练篮球，在后院花无数个小时练习上篮。但我儿子对运动毫无兴趣，甚至讨厌运动。前几天他画了一把**射线枪**，说这叫“运动枪”，是一种特殊的激光枪，能射掉宇宙中所有的球，这样他就再也不用参加体育运动了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: So, my son really reminds me of what I was like as a kid. I was sensitive. I had passionate interests. I guess you could call that nerdy. Unlike my son, I was so desperate to be cool that I forced myself to get good at basketball by spending a million hours shooting layups in my backyard. My son has no interest in sports. In fact, he hates sports so much. The other day he drew a picture of a ray gun. And he was like, "This is called the sports gun. It's a special kind of laser gun that will shoot all the balls in the universe so I'll never have to play sports."

</details>

### 恐惧、霸凌与韧性

**Sam**: 他想待在自己的想象世界里，翻开木头看下面的昆虫。我记得带他去参加一个室内篮球馆的生日派对，其他孩子篮球打得极好，而我儿子甚至不知道规则，运球方向都是反的。这让我意识到，虽然强悍和运动是两码事，但在男孩的世界里，如果你不擅长运动，你就很难变酷，很难交到朋友。我不在乎他以后打不打大学篮球，我在乎的是我不希望他成为那个被**霸凌**、被嘲笑或被群体排斥的人。如果他喜欢戏剧、自然或科学，那很好。但我希望他至少能培养出一些**韧性**（**Resilience**）。如果他因为与众不同而被挑剔，他需要有足够的自信站出来说：“没错，我就是不一样，滚远点。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: He wants to be in his world of imagination. He wants to turn over logs and see what insects are underneath them. I remember when I took him to a birthday party at this indoor basketball facility and the other kids were like sick at basketball and my son had never played basketball so he was dribbling the wrong way down the court. And I realize it's like—you asked me about toughness and now I'm just talking about sports. And they are different things. But I think the way in which it's connected is it comes from the feeling that for boys, if you're not good at sports, it's kind of a wrap. You're not going to be cool, you're not going to make friends. What I give a crap about is that I just don't want him to be somebody who gets bullied or even made fun of or just excluded from the group. And if he wants to do theater and nature stuff, great. But I want him to at least develop some toughness and resilience because if he gets picked on for being different, you have to have a really solid sense of confidence. You have to have a solid sense of like if someone tries to push me around like I'm going to stand up for myself and be like, "Yeah, I'm different and [__] off."

</details>

**Sam**: 我给他报了**空手道**班。刚开始像舞蹈课，只是练习动作。但到了橙带，你就得开始实战对抗了。他做不到。他害怕被打，也害怕打人。对他来说那是种折磨。我鼓励他说有护具不会受伤，但他就是无法出手。我花了几百美元买护具，结果他第二天就退课了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: I enrolled him in a karate school. When you're first starting out, it's basically like dance class. Once you get to orange belt, it's the first time where you have to do something scary. You start fighting other kids. But he couldn't do it. He was afraid of getting hit, but he was also afraid of hitting. And it was misery for him. I really tried to encourage him, but he just couldn't do it. So after I dropped like hundreds of dollars on these pads, he dropped out like the next day.

</details>

**Anna**: 你在现场看过他实战吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Did he go to class? Was there a class where they were sparring and he just couldn't do it?

</details>

**Sam**: 是的，他总是站在那儿。另一个孩子不停地出拳，他就在那儿站着，直到教练宣布对方获胜。我在场边喊：“伙计，你得进攻啊！你不能只站着挨打，你得还击，得保护自己。”但他只会非常敷衍地拍一下，然后继续僵在那里。他真的不想出拳或踢腿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: Yeah. I mean, he wanted to quit right away and I kept pushing him to go back, but he would just kind of stand there. And the other kid would be punching and he would just kind of stand there until the sensei was like, "All right, the other guy won." And I probably even said from the sidelines, "Dude, you got to go on the offensive, too. You can't just stand there like getting hit. You have to hit back. You have to defend yourself." And then he would just do like a very tepid tap type thing and go back to just standing there frozen.

</details>

### 童年的阴影与耻辱感

**Anna**: 这里涉及到一个很有趣的话题，即强悍与**暴力**之间的博弈。你不仅鼓励他回击，还希望他能保护自己。你觉得你儿子需要具备战斗能力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: One thing I want to get into here is the sort of interplay between toughness and violence. Why did you feel like your son needed to be able to fight?

</details>

**Sam**: 这是我的核心疑问：你能不能在教导男孩反对暴力的同时，又灌输给他韧性、强悍和自信？我也厌恶暴力，但如果你教孩子武术，那不仅仅是学习格挡。我至今没有答案。我在反思：在抚养儿子的过程中，你对暴力的真实立场是什么？你真的认为告诉他“必要时你必须挥拳打断别人的鼻子，看着鲜血流出来”是正确的吗？还是认为伤害他人永远是不对的？这两种选择都有严重的后果。如果你选择“转过另一边脸”或逃跑——就像我小时候那样——也会有后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: So this is like the central question for me: can you instill a sense of resilience and toughness and self-confidence in a boy and be against violence? I also abhore violence and yet if you teach your kids martial arts it's not just learning how to block. I still don't have the answers. But what I was trying to figure out is: what is your actual position on violence vis-a-vis raising a son? Do you actually think that it is the right thing to do to tell him that he has to be willing to punch someone in the face if it comes to it? Or do you actually think that it's never okay to harm another human being? If he is the "punch the guy in the nose" guy, there are consequences. And if he is the "turn the other cheek" guy or the runaway guy, which is what I was like as a kid, there's also some serious consequences to that.

</details>

**Anna**: 你小时候是那种“转过另一边脸”的孩子。那是什么样子的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: You were the turn the other cheek kid growing up. Paint me a picture of that.

</details>

**Sam**: 在我童年的记忆里，每当遇到可怕的事情，我都会逃跑、回避或放弃。这些时刻让我感到巨大的**耻辱**。我记得有一次和好朋友 **Rob** 打篮球，对方是一群自称“JP 狗舍”的帮派少年。其中一个孩子一直在作弊，Rob 拆穿了他。那个孩子暴怒，掐住 Rob 的脖子把他按在铁丝网上，威胁要揍扁他。我当时就僵在那里，什么也没做，没有站出来保护我的朋友。Rob 感到被背叛了，我也因此背负了沉重的心理负担。我因为害怕暴力而抛弃了朋友。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: When I was younger, when there was a scary thing, I would run away or I would just avoid the situation or I would quit. The moments that fill me with the greatest shame. I remember there were these kids in this like gang called the JP Dog Pound. Me and my buddy Rob were playing basketball with them and one of the kids kept cheating. Rob called him out. And the kid got really riled up and he grabbed Rob and pressed him up against this chain link fence and was basically like "I'm going to beat the [__] out of you." And I just stood there frozen. I didn't do anything to try to defend him and he felt abandoned in that moment. My fear of violence in that moment led to me doing the wrong thing for my friend.

</details>

**Sam**: 这种感觉延伸到了我生活的方方面面。我不敢在舞池里跳舞，我害怕女生，甚至不敢答应女生的约会，因为我觉得自己是个懦夫，而只有真正的男人才配拥有女朋友。我甚至不是个好学生，因为我缺乏学习的信心。当我遇到困难的数学题时，我会觉得：“我是个失败者，我是个胆小鬼，我肯定学不会。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: It extended even beyond that. I was afraid to dance; I was afraid of girls. Not only was I terrified of asking a girl out, but I was afraid to say yes when a girl asked me out because I thought, "Well, I'm a [__], only someone who's really secure in their masculinity can have a girlfriend." It all comes from the idea of being a physical coward. I was in danger of flunking out of my high school because I didn't have the confidence to learn. When something was hard like math, I was just like "I'm not going to be able to get it."

### 恶地之旅：追随罗斯福的足迹

**Anna**: 那么，你打算如何“训练”你的儿子，教他韧性呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: So, what was your plan to toughen up your son to teach him resilience?

</details>

**Sam**: 我儿子对**国家公园**有着近乎痴迷的热爱，因此他爱上了**西奥多·罗斯福**（**Teddy Roosevelt**），这位被视为“国家公园教父”的总统。我提议花一周时间去他选的任何公园，他选了北达科他州的**恶地**（**Badlands**）——**西奥多·罗斯福国家公园**。那是个荒凉、强悍的地方，充满了岩石、野牛和峭壁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: My son has always had an obsessive personality. His current obsession is national parks. He really fell in love with Teddy Roosevelt, who is kind of seen as the godfather of the national parks. I said, "Let's spend a whole week. I'll let you pick any park." And he was like, "I want to go to the Badlands. I want to go to Teddy Roosevelt National Park." That's in North Dakota. It's a badass place. It's the Wild West. It's a hard land filled with rocks and bison.

</details>

**Sam**: 更有趣的是，罗斯福小时候也是个极其胆小、体弱多病的“书呆子”，甚至出门都需要弟弟保护。但他后来把自己塑造成了硬汉的典范。我想通过这次旅行，在这样一个充满男性气概象征的地方，和儿子一起探索什么是男人。我最初的幻想是像罗斯福那样生活，去牧场骑马、弄得满身泥土，但我意识到那对他（甚至对我）来说都不会是个愉快的假期。所以我决定推行“**奋斗的人生**”，带他去进行比以往更艰难的徒步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: Teddy Roosevelt, like me, like my son, was actually a huge nerd as a little kid and a hugely fearful little kid. He got his ass beat as a little kid. So Teddy Roosevelt now, we think of him as the iconic man. I wanted to have a road trip where I get to explore what it means to be like a man with my son in a place that was this iconic site of masculinity. My dream outcome was: I want to push him to do harder hikes than he's ever done and see if he can deal, because that's the discomfort. That's the resilience.

</details>

**Sam**: 第一天并不顺利。刚走几分钟他就喊饿，吵着要回游客中心吃零食。他很害怕，因为公园里有攻击性很强的**野牛**（**Bison**）。我试图用各种方式贿赂他，甚至不断引用罗斯福的话：“来吧，让我们体验奋斗的人生！”最后他一直在抱怨，我只好作罢。但第二天，他完全让我吃惊了。他主动要求离开步道去“**开辟新路**”，甚至爬上了那些被称为“孤峰”的高大岩层。他坚持要走在最前面当先锋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: Within minutes he's like, "I'm hungry. Let's go back to the visitor center." And then he's also scared because there are wild bison. I kept saying to him, "Come on let's live the strenuous life!" Finally he just kept complaining. I'm like "All right let's call it a day." But then the next day he totally surprised me. He was like "Let's go off trail." He got really into the idea of climbing up these beautiful rock formations called buttes. He insisted on being in the front; he wanted to be the trailblazer.

</details>

**Anna**: 你觉得是什么让他发生了这种转变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: What do you think changed from one day to another?

</details>

**Sam**: 我们每晚都会读罗斯福的传记，读到他小时候被打的经历。我告诉他，罗斯福并非天生强悍，他是通过后天努力改变的。我想他可能受到了启发。那天风很大，天空阴沉，我们爬得非常高，甚至到了狭窄的山脊上。我开始感到害怕，但他却转过头对我说：“来吧，爸爸，我们在体验奋斗的人生呢！”那一刻我既害怕又自豪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: Every night we were reading parts of the Teddy Roosevelt book and we read a part about when Teddy Roosevelt got beat up as a kid. I'm basically saying to him like Teddy Roosevelt changed. He was not naturally tough. He made himself tougher. At one point, we're on this narrow ridge and the wind started to pick up. I'm starting to get scared but he wasn't scared and he actually turned to me and he's like "Come on we're living the strenuous life, come on dad."

</details>

### 从罗斯福到皮·威·赫曼

**Sam**: 旅行中也发生了一些复杂的事情。我们经过了**伤膝河**（**Wounded Knee**），那是美国原住民遭遇大屠杀的地方。儿子开始问：“爸爸，原住民做了什么坏事才遭到这种对待吗？”我告诉他：“没有，他们什么也没做错。这是一件非常邪恶的事情。”他还问罗斯福是好人还是坏人。我不得不告诉他，罗斯福虽然有伟大的一面，但他也是个帝国主义者，认为非白人是低等的，而且他崇尚暴力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: There were things that were happening on the trip that were complicated. We actually drove through the site of the most infamous massacre in the history of the genocide of Native American people, which was at Wounded Knee. He starts asking questions: "Dad, did the Native Americans do anything to deserve this?" I'm like, "No, they didn't actually." He says to me, "Dad, was Teddy Roosevelt a bad guy or a good guy?" I paused for a long time. Teddy Roosevelt was a massive imperialist. He loved violence. That's the dark side of the masculine guy.

</details>

**Sam**: 后来，为了奖励他，我让他看 iPad。他下载了一部新电影《**皮·威·赫曼大冒险**》（**Pee-wee's Big Adventure**）。他在后座笑得前仰后合。**皮·威·赫曼**（**Pee-wee Herman**）是一个非常“弱鸡”的角色，与罗斯福的硬汉形象截然相反。他靠机智和恶作剧取胜，而不是靠拳头。我儿子彻底迷上了他，甚至在亚马逊上搜皮·威的西装和红色领结。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: He watched "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." I just start hearing him cracking up in the back seat. Pee-wee is a really wimpy guy. Definitely the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt energy. He kind of gets by on his wits and he gets by with little tricks, not by punching people in the face. And my son just really vibed with it. He started looking up Pee-wee Herman outfits and wanted to buy a red bow tie.

</details>

**Anna**: 你担心吗？担心如果他模仿皮·威那样的人，会在现实世界里挨打？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Were you worried? Were you worried he'd get beat up if he started wearing the bow tie?

</details>

**Sam**: 是的。在电影里，皮·威虽然古怪，但赢得了所有人的尊重。但在现实世界里，像他这样的人往往会遭到残酷的霸凌和恐同言论的攻击。我支持他做自己，但我也不希望他受伤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: Yes. In the movie, it's a beautiful fantasy because Pee-wee doesn't really get bullied. He spellbinds everybody with his charisma. But in the real world, wouldn't Pee-wee get his ass beat? Wouldn't people be calling Pee-wee nasty homophobic words?

</details>

### 恶作剧口香糖：第三种选择

**Sam**: 旅行的最后一个晚上，我决定进行一次“霸凌演习”。我扮演霸凌者，让他练习如何反击。我对他冷嘲热讽，说他的梦想会失败，甚至假装推了他一下。他一开始的反应很软弱，只是轻轻拍了我一下。我觉得这个实验失败了。但过了一会儿，他说：“爸爸，再来一次，我想到了一个好办法。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: On the last night of the trip, I say like, "All right, I want to do like a role playing thing where I'm going to pretend to be a bully and I want you to stand up for yourself." I come up to him. I'm like, "Bro, you're a loser." I gave him a fake shove. It didn't feel good to do that. It was a failed experiment. And then at one point he's like "Wait, I thought of a good way to fight back against the bully. Be a bully again dad."

</details>

**Sam**: 我再次对他出言不逊，他却平静地说：“我很高兴你这么想。但我宁愿和你交朋友也不愿和你打架。你要来片口香糖吗？”我愣了一下，接过他递来的“口香糖”放进嘴里。他笑着大喊：“那是**恶作剧口香糖**（**Trick Gum**）！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: I'm like "Hey you're a loser." And he goes, "Well, you know, I'm glad you feel that way. I'd rather be friends with you than fight you. Can I offer you a piece of gum?" I put it in my mouth and then he's like "I have news for you. It's trick gum!"

</details>

**Sam**: 我被深深地触动了。他在潜意识里做了一件非常深刻的事：他在说，你比我强壮得多，我无法用武力战胜你，但我可以用我的机智。恶作剧口香糖是无害的，它只是让对方感到尴尬。他提供了一套“**第三种选择**”：你可以捍卫自己，而不必伤害他人；你可以利用幽默来化解危机。这说明他内心深处已经拥有了那种我小时候所缺乏的自信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: I'm very moved by the trick gum because on an unconscious level, he's doing something kind of profound. He's saying "You're way bigger than me and I'm not going to be able to beat you with brawn. I'm going to use my wits to beat you." What he was actually offering was a third way. You can stand up for yourself without physically hurting someone. You can be yourself. It showed me this kid has a kind of inner belief in himself that I actually didn't have as a kid.

</details>

**Sam**: 作为父母，最难但也最重要的事情之一，就是相信你的孩子，知道他们“能行”。我不需要把他模塑成任何样子。他现在在班级合照里是唯一穿西装打领结的人。我依然会担心他，因为与众不同必然会与社会产生摩擦，但我不再彻夜难眠。他那种“**不在乎别人眼光**”的特质，将是他的超能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sam**: You realize that your job as a parent is to like walk away and just let him do his own thing. Believe in your child and know that they got this. He got his class picture back yesterday. He is the only person in the class picture wearing a suit. I do still worry about him a little bit because he is different. But I just feel like he kind of has this Pee-wee quality of just not giving a [__]. I think that's going to be his superpower.

</details>
