<p class="english-text">hi everybody I'm Nikolai tangan the CEO of the Norwegian so wealth fund and today we have a bonus episode on trust and we have the world's leading expert on trust Rachel botsman here with me uh she's written two books what's mine is yours and who can you trust so I absolutely love the work you're doing um big thanks for for being here thank you it's nice to hear on a bonus episode well you are like a real you are like a real bonus so let's just k kick off with the with um with the basics here so what is trust what is trust um it's actually a very hard question um it's a word we use a lot but when you ask people to Define trust you'll never get the same answer so uh depending on the field some people will say it's an asset some people describe it as a currency or an attribute um some people might say it's a value but trust is a belief it's a belief towards someone or something um and what we're still figuring out is if the way we trust the someone a human and The Way We Trust as something are the same thing and the important thing once you ground yourself that trust is a belief all beliefs are highly subjective and contextual and it's the contextual piece around trust that is often missing in the conversation so you've probably heard people say oh I don't trust the media or I don't trust this politician I don't trust this tech company it's a completely useless conversation to be having because whenever we talk about trust we should follow up with to do what what is it we're trusting someone or something to do what is it we're not trusted to do because um unwanted trust is a problem why is trust so important um so it's funny I really struggle answering this question because um there's so many reasons so I've been studying this now for 15 years and what I've realized is that you cannot take risks you cannot Venture into the unknown you cannot navigate uncertainty without trust and it's interesting because when I first started studying trust I probably would have spoken more about the social glue the collaboration those components um but I've realized actually Innovation self trust this ability to cope with uncertainty to cope with not knowing is one of the most important roles of trust today so that's why I put the emphasis there</p>

**Nikolai:** 今天我们有一期关于信任的特别节目，我们邀请到了世界顶级的信任专家雷切尔·博茨曼（Rachel Botsman）与我一同探讨。她撰写了两本书，分别是《我的就是你的》（"What's Mine Is Yours"）和《你能信任谁？》（"Who Can You Trust"）。我非常喜欢你所做的工作，非常感谢你的到来。

<p class="english-text">and today we have a bonus episode on trust and we have the world's leading expert on trust Rachel botsman here with me uh she's written two books what's mine is yours and who can you trust so I absolutely love the work you're doing um big thanks for for being here thank you it's nice to hear on a bonus episode well you are like a real you are like a real bonus so let's just k kick off with the with um with the basics here so what is trust what is trust um it's actually a very hard question um it's a word we use a lot but when you ask people to Define trust you'll never get the same answer so uh depending on the field some people will say it's an asset some people describe it as a currency or an attribute um some people might say it's a value but trust is a belief it's a belief towards someone or something um and what we're still figuring out is if the way we trust the someone a human and The Way We Trust as something are the same thing and the important thing once you ground yourself that trust is a belief all beliefs are highly subjective and contextual and it's the contextual piece around trust that is often missing in the conversation so you've probably heard people say oh I don't trust the media or I don't trust this politician I don't trust this tech company it's a completely useless conversation to be having because whenever we talk about trust we should follow up with to do what what is it we're trusting someone or something to do what is it we're not trusted to do because um unwanted trust is a problem why is trust so important um so it's funny I really struggle answering this question because um there's so many reasons so I've been studying this now for 15 years and what I've realized is that you cannot take risks you cannot Venture into the unknown you cannot navigate uncertainty without trust and it's interesting because when I first started studying trust I probably would have spoken more about the social glue the collaboration those components um but I've realized actually Innovation self trust this ability to cope with uncertainty to cope with not knowing is one of the most important roles of trust today so that's why I put the emphasis there</p>

**Rachel:** 很高兴能参加这期特别节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thank you it's nice to hear on a bonus episode</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 你就像一个真正的额外惊喜。那么，让我们从最基本的问题开始：什么是信任？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well you are like a real you are like a real bonus so let's just k kick off with the with um with the basics here so what is trust what is trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是一个非常困难的问题。我们经常使用“信任”这个词，但当你要求人们定义它时，你永远不会得到相同的答案。根据不同的领域，有些人会说它是一种资产，有些人将其描述为一种货币或一种属性，还有些人可能说它是一种价值。但信任本质上是一种**信念**（Belief），是对某人或某事的信念。我们仍在探索的是，我们信任一个人（人类）的方式与我们信任一件事物的方式是否相同。重要的是，一旦你确立信任是一种信念，那么所有的信念都是高度主观和情境化的，而关于信任的“情境化”部分在讨论中常常被忽略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um it's actually a very hard question um it's a word we use a lot but when you ask people to Define trust you'll never get the same answer so uh depending on the field some people will say it's an asset some people describe it as a currency or an attribute um some people might say it's a value but trust is a belief it's a belief towards someone or something um and what we're still figuring out is if the way we trust the someone a human and The Way We Trust as something are the same thing and the important thing once you ground yourself that trust is a belief all beliefs are highly subjective and contextual and it's the contextual piece around trust that is often missing in the conversation</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 你可能听过人们说：“哦，我不信任媒体”或者“我不信任这位政客”、“我不信任这家科技公司”。这种对话是完全没有意义的，因为每当我们谈论信任时，我们都应该追问：“信任去做什么？”我们信任某人或某事去做什么？我们不信任他们去做什么？因为不必要的信任是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you've probably heard people say oh I don't trust the media or I don't trust this politician I don't trust this tech company it's a completely useless conversation to be having because whenever we talk about trust we should follow up with to do what what is it we're trusting someone or something to do what is it we're not trusted to do because um unwanted trust is a problem</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 为什么信任如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why is trust so important</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，很有趣，我很难回答这个问题，原因有很多。我已经研究信任15年了，我意识到你无法承担风险，无法冒险进入未知领域，无法驾驭不确定性，除非有信任。有趣的是，当我刚开始研究信任时，我可能更多地谈论社会凝聚力、协作等组成部分。但我现在意识到，创新、**自我信任**（Self-Trust）以及这种应对不确定性、应对未知的能力，是当今信任最重要的作用之一。这就是我强调这一点的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so it's funny I really struggle answering this question because um there's so many reasons so I've been studying this now for 15 years and what I've realized is that you cannot take risks you cannot Venture into the unknown you cannot navigate uncertainty without trust and it's interesting because when I first started studying trust I probably would have spoken more about the social glue the collaboration those components um but I've realized actually Innovation self trust this ability to cope with uncertainty to cope with not knowing is one of the most important roles of trust today so that's why I put the emphasis there</p>
</details>

### 信任的建立与破坏

**Nikolai:** 为什么建立信任需要这么长时间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why does it take so long time to build trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，我会质疑这个问题，因为大多数人都有信任的天然倾向。大多数人进入一个情境时，他们不会说“我不信任你”，他们会等待理由——我们称之为**信任信号**（Trust Signals）——来决定为什么他们不应该信任那个人。所以，默认是信任的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um well I I would challenge that question because um most people have a natural propensity to trust okay um so most people will go into a situation and they won't say I don't trust you they'll be they'll wait for reasons signals we call them trust signals as to why they shouldn't trust that person okay so so the default is to trust</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 默认是信任的，这很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the default is to trust which is great</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 但它很快就会被摧毁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's certainly very quick to tear it down it's very quick to tear tear down very quick to tear down</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，所以我们所说的**交易性信任**（Transactional Trust）和**关系性信任**（Relational Trust）之间存在差异。交易性信任很容易被摧毁，而关系性信任则是通过经验、信息和时间建立起来的。我认为这是许多组织、公司和品牌常犯的另一个错误，他们以交易性的方式思考信任，而没有充分思考信任中人际关系的成分，这种关系性信任实际上更难被摧毁。如果一个产品或服务让我失望，而该公司试图解决问题的方式是交易性的，那么很难再次信任它。但如果是人际关系性的，你实际上可以重新赢得信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so there's a difference between what we call sort of transactional trust um which is very easy to turn tear down and relational trust which is built with experience it's built with information it's built over time and I think this is another mistake many organizations and companies and Brands they think about trust in a transactional sense and what they don't think enough about is this relational human component of trust which is actually harder to tear down so if a product fails me or if a service fails me and the way that company tries to solve the problem is transactional um it's very hard to trust it again if it's human and relational you can actually earn trust back</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我们信任政客去做什么？我用这个问题来挑战你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do we trust politicians to do what I'll challenge you with that question question</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 治理国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">run the country</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 以适当的方式治理国家。在哪个国家？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to run the country in a proper way in which country</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，让我们从这个国家开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，不，在这个国家和某些政客身上，情况并非如此。现在回到情境。就情境而言，我们现在在英国。有些政客我信任他们做某些事情，但总的来说，当我们审视政府信任度时，它正处于历史最低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well no not in this country and certain politicians so go back to context now just for the just for the context here we are now in the UK okay we are in the UK um there are certain politicians I trust to do certain things um but generally when we look at trust in government it is at an all-time low um when we</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why why is it um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 原因有很多，但如果你不断深究，核心问题在于人们不再相信政府的利益与他们的最佳利益相符。这实际上跨越了人口统计学、教育、收入和阶级。这种不一致可能表现为“我不认为政府对我的税收做了正确的事情”，一直到“我不认为政府对教育或我的医疗保健做了正确的事情”。所以，当你面临这种**利益不一致**（Misalignment）问题时，它是最深层、最难解决的信任问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's a whole host of factors but if you keep stripping them back um the central problem is to do with a line M that people no longer believe that the government's interests align with their best interests and that actually runs across demographics it runs across um education income class so it could be alignment could be I don't think the government does the right thing by my taxes to all the way through to I don't think the government does the right thing for education or my Healthcare so when you have a misalignment problem um is the deepest deepest trust problem to fix</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 什么时候你会看到幸福感学校遍布各国？例如，芬兰的幸福感得分非常高，其中一个真正的区别因素是人们信任这个系统，他们信任政客。那里的信任度很高，没有腐败。那么，为什么信任对幸福感如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when will you get it's interesting when will you get the happiness schools across Nations so Finland for instance SCH is very high one of the real differentiator there is that people trust the system right they trust the politicians that trust the that trust there is very that there is no uh corruption MH why so why is trust so important for happiness</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 关于信任和幸福感的研究，我必须说它非常具有文化性。北欧国家在这方面做得非常好。信任和幸福感的一个重要组成部分，它们相互关联的地方，是**社区**（Community）和**集体利益**（Collective Interest）。所以，在那些不仅变得极度个人主义，而且变得自恋的文化中，缺乏对集体社会公益的信念，这些文化往往信任度较低，幸福感得分也较低。我坚信，这种社区的缺失、集体利益的缺失，这种“我胜过我们”的心态，正在损害幸福感，也在损害信任。因此，你必须相信，就像在芬兰和丹麦一样，这些社会系统不仅为你服务，它们还创造了一种超越你个体自我的更强烈的归属感。当这种情况发生时，你就会产生信任和幸福感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the day in the research around trust and happiness um I mean is very cultural I should say so the nordics do really well on this um part of a big component of trust and happiness where they align is um Community Collective interest so um in cultures that become not just hyper individualistic but narcissistic where there is a lack of belief in the collective social good they tend to be lower trusting cultures with lower scores of Happiness so one of the things I strongly believe is this lack of community this lack of collective interests this me over we is damaging happiness and it's damaging trust so you have to believe like in Finland like in Denmark that these social systems they serve you but they also create a greater sense of belonging to something bigger than your individual self and when that happens you generate trust and you generate happiness</p>
</details>

### 信任的演变：从本地到Auto Sapient

**Nikolai:** 随着时间的推移，信任发生了什么变化？与50或100年前相比，我们现在处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's happened to trust over time so where are we now compared to let's say 50 or 100 years ago</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这又是一个巨大的问题。我工作中的一个主线，也是我仍在研究信任的原因，就是这个核心问题：信任是在衰退还是在变化？它是在像你看到的那些图表一样下降，还是在转向？我看到的是，当你通过这个视角思考信任时，你会开始看到社会中的这些转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that's another huge question um so one of the things that has been a thread through my work and why I'm sort of still studying trust is this central question of is trust in a state of decline or is it changing so is it going down like you see these graphs or is it pivoting and what I've seen is that actually when you think of trust through this lens you start to see Society in these shifts</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这些转变在最高层面上可以分为我所描述的**本地信任**（Local Trust）。当人们生活在小村庄和社区时，信任主要基于你认识的人，是高度人际化的信任。这种信任难以扩展，所以我们发明了**机构**（Institutions）。机构包括物理机构、机制，比如合同和保险，甚至概念，比如工会。那是一个令人难以置信的创新时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the way these shifts map at the highest level is what I describe as local trust so when people lived in small villages and communities and it was largely based on people that you knew highly interpersonal trust that trust is hard to scale so we invented institutions um institutions being physical institutions um mechanisms so things like contracts and insurance even Concepts things like trade unions and that was an incredible period of innovation those institutional mechanisms</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 随后技术出现了，特别是网络和平台，以及社交媒体，它**分布式**（Distributed）了信任。我们还没有完全走出那个阶段，我们正在看到它造成的混乱，而且我们已经进入了第四个阶段，我称之为**Auto Sapient 信任**（Auto Sapient Trust）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">technology came along um particularly networks and platforms social media and it distributed trust now we are not through that phase we're seeing the chaos that that's causing and we're already entering the fourth phase which I call Autos Sapient trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 尼古拉，最直观的理解方式是通过能量流来想象。如果你想象**机构信任**（Institutional Trust）是向上的信任，我们仰视专家、监管者和裁判。**分布式信任**（Distributed Trust）是横向的，我信任另一个人获取信息，胜过信任新闻。而Auto Sapient信任是另一种形式，通过它，我们甚至无法区分我们是信任另一个人还是信任一台智能机器。所以我发现，通过这些流动的箭头来想象信任，是理解社会中各种动态和变化的一种非常有力的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um the isest way Nicolai to visualize this is actually through sort of energy flows so if you imagine institutional trust upwards trust right we looked upwards to experts and regulators and referees distributed sideways I trust another person for information more than I trust the news and alter Sapient is another where it's through trust we won't even be able to make this distinction between whether we're trusting another person or whether we're trusting an intelligent machine so I find like imagining trust through these flow arrows is a really powerful way of sort of getting my head around all kinds of Dynamics and changes happening in society</p>
</details>

### 数字时代与AI对信任的影响

**Nikolai:** 那么，请向我们解释一下整个数字空间和手机等是如何改变这种格局的，以及它如何从机构信任转向个人信任，举一些例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um explain to us the how the whole digital space and mobile phones and so on have changed this landscape and how it's gone from institutional trust to individual trust some examples</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 它改变了关于信任的一切。它从根本上改变了我们信任完全陌生人并与人建立联系的方式。当你突然能够以非常不同的方式思考供需时，比如我想要某样东西，而你拥有那样东西——那可能是一条信息、一项技能、时间、爱，或者是我想要租的房子——我们突然可以通过这种技术连接起来并促成信任，你就改变了价值的流动、信息的流动、关系的流动。我们已经看到了这如何创造创新，从阿里巴巴（Alibaba）和易贝（eBay）这样的平台，到优步（Uber）、爱彼迎（Airbnb）、教育平台，我们都看到了它创造了什么。但问题是，当事情出错时会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it changed everything when it comes to trust so it fundamentally changed the way we could trust total strangers and connect with people and so when you can suddenly think very differently about supply and demand so I want something and you have that thing that thing might be a piece of information it might be a skill it might be time it might be love it might be a house that I want to rent and we can suddenly connect and facilitate trust through that technology you change the flow of value you change the flow of information you change the flow of relationships and we've seen how that creates innovation so everything from platforms like Alibaba and eBay Uber Airbnb um education platforms um we've seen what it creates but the problem is what happens when things go wrong</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 爱彼迎，你信任人们到足以让他们住在你家里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so uh Airbnb you trust people enough to let them stay in your house</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 是的，但不是在我家的时候。这很奇怪，但这可能因为我真的不喜欢——我信任在我不在家时把房子租出去，但我不喜欢我在家时有人在里面。从信任的角度来看，这有点奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes but not when I'm there which is strange but maybe that's because I I don't really like I I trust to rent out my home when I'm not there but I don't like people being there when I'm home right which is kind of weird from a trust perspective</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 为什么会这样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's why is it this way</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我认为这是因为，嗯，这实际上不是信任问题，而是我不喜欢陌生人在我家。但我相信我不在的时候他们会尊重我的家。我只遇到过几次不好的经历，但我们就不深入讨论那些了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I think it's because uh it's not actually so a trust it's I don't really like strangers in my home um but I trust when I'm no way that they'll treat it with respect so and I've only had a couple of bad experiences but uh we won't go into those</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 人工智能（AI）将如何发展？我们什么时候会开始信任机器？我的意思是，我们信任机器吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is going to happen with AI when are we going to start trust machines I mean do we trust machines</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这又是一个巨大的问题。我的意思是，我还是会说“信任AI去做什么？”对吧？所以，我认为目前大多数人看待AI的方式是把它当作一个工具。它是一个在手机或桌面上打开的东西，他们用它来获取信息。所以他们有一个问题，他们把它输入到某个，比如说**ChatGPT**（Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人），它会给出信息。这种信任的飞跃正在非常非常快地发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is another huge question I mean again I'd say trusting AI to do what right so I think at the moment the way most people think about AI is a tool it's something that sits open on their phone or on their desktop and they are using it for information so they have a question they put it into some let's just say chat GPT and it gives information um and that trust leap is happening really really fast</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我会说，当你查看大多数行业的数据时，他们不信任AI进行决策。金融就是一个很好的例子，对吧？所以我信任它提供信息，但要真正做出最终决定，这是一个不同的信任飞跃。但我们看到的是，法律领域非常有趣。我丈夫是一名律师，他对这个领域非常感兴趣。我们当时在讨论，一年前，法官们还说律师不能使用AI来帮助准备案情摘要，但在不到一年的时间里，情况发生了360度大转弯。因为他们意识到，AI实际上可以搜索像**巴拿马文件**（Panama Papers: 揭露离岸金融秘密的泄露文件）这样的数据，这是一个很好的例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I would say when you look at the data across most sectors um they don't trust it for decision making so Finance is a good example right so I trust it for information but to actually make the final decision um is a is a different trust leap but what we're seeing is that and I think the law is really interesting so um my husband's a lawyer and he's really interested in this space and we were talking about how a year ago um judges said you know lawyers cannot use AI to help prepare briefs and there's been a 360 turnaround on that in less than a year because what they're realizing is actually you know AI can search through data like the Panama papers great example right</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，当一项新技术出现时，尤其是在高风险环境中，我们的最初反应是说“不”，是拒绝它，是不信任它。我认为真正有趣且有点令人担忧的是，这些转变在不同行业中发生的速度有多快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so our initial reaction when something comes along there's a new technology particularly in high stakes high risk environments is to say no to reject it to not trust it and I think what is really interesting and slightly frightening is how fast those turnarounds are happening in different sectors</p>
</details>

### 职场信任的挑战：远程工作与监控

**Nikolai:** 让我们谈谈职场中的信任，居家办公。那里存在哪些信任问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so let's talk about um trust in the workplace working from home yes what are the issues with trust there</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是一个有趣的问题。让我尝试从不同层面来解读。居家办公可能会激发出一些人最糟糕的微观管理倾向，它实际上会引发非常低的信任。这是一个双向问题，涉及员工和老板。员工可能会坐在那里想：“嗯，我不确定这个人是否信任我”，因为当没有面对面的互动时，它会产生一个真空，一个空白，而我们会在那个空白中形成一种叙事，这种叙事通常不是积极的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this is an interesting one um so let me try to unpack this on different levels um working from home can bring out the worst micromanagement in some people so it can actually trigger very low trust so and this is a two-way thing so this is both the employee and the boss so the employee might sit there going um I'm not sure this person trust me because when there isn't that face-to-face interaction it creates a vacuum it creates a gap and we form in our minds a narrative in that gap which is often not positive right</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以没有人会坐在那里想：“哦，是的，我的老板真的相信我一直在工作。”他们会想：“我必须证明我在工作。”对吧？所以你会有各种各样的，嗯，不是生产力技巧，而是**生产力表现**（Productivity Performance），我们称之为生产力表现。所以人们需要证明他们在Slack上，人们需要更长时间地停留在电子邮件上。这是第一个问题，对吧？人们会怀疑他们是否被信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so no one sits there going oh yes my my boss really trusts that I'm working all the time they go I've got to demonstrate that I'm working right so you have all these kind of um productivity not hacks but PE performance like productivity performance we call it so people needing to demonstrate they on slack people staying on email longer that's the first problem right that people second guess whether they're trusted um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 现在，在某些情况下，这可能确实是真的。许多老板和领导者并不是在远程工作的时代长大的，对吧？他们必须亲自到办公室。即使在疫情期间，也没有人教他们如何远程管理人员，如何放手，作为老板，你做了哪些事情可能被对方视为控制？所以他们常常会发出信号，表明他们不信任对方去做某些事情。因此，存在一种非常有趣的紧张关系，我们还不知道如何解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in some scenarios that may not that may actually be true so um many bosses and leaders didn't grow up in the year of remote work right they physically had to come into the office they have not been taught even through the pandemic how do you manage people remotely how do you let go what are the things that you do as a boss that actually can be perceived as controlling by the other person so they will often signal things that they don't trust the other person to do so there's this really interesting tension that goes on that we don't really know how to fix yet</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 第二件事，数据才刚刚开始显现，就是远程工作如何影响人际信任。你真的能像面对面那样在虚拟环境中培养信任吗？我个人认为不能，因为当两个人——我们可以通过Zoom通话或屏幕进行交流，对吧？——我们不会感受到同样的能量，我无法以同样的方式解读你。即使拥有世界上最好的技术，当你与某人坐在一起时，那种人际连接、那种人类能量，很难在虚拟环境中复制。

<p class="english-text">the second thing and the data is just coming starting to come through on this is how remote working is impacting interpersonal trust so can you really nurture trust virtually in the same way as you can face to face where can you I personally believe no because there is something that happens when two human beings so we could do this through a a a zoom call right or through the screen yeah we wouldn't feel the same kind of energy I couldn't read you in the same way um and with the very best technology in the world that human connection that human energy when you sit down with someone um is very hard to replicate virtually</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 让我担忧的一件事是，我们是否正在失去这项技能。我的意思是，领导者们一直告诉我，他们有大量的员工现在不习惯亲自与客户坐在一个房间里开会，甚至不是一个有争议的会议，只是坐下来与人相处，因为他们太习惯于技术作为中介了。对我来说，这是一个非常大的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and one of the things that worries me is whether we're losing this skill I mean I have leaders tell me all the time that they have huge cohorts of workers that are now uncomfortable sitting physically in a room with a client in a meeting not even in a contentious meeting just sitting and being with people because they're so used to the technology being the mediator and that for me is a really big worry</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 这是否意味着我们应该更多地去办公室？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that is this an argument for being more in the office</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 有目的地去。我非常相信混合工作模式，我相信在家和办公室进行不同类型的工作，我也非常相信它如何有助于包容性，尤其作为一名有两个年幼孩子的女性。但我认为我们低估了我们正在失去的一项技能。说人们不习惯与一群人坐在一个房间里，这听起来很奇怪，因为他们的经历、他们进入职场的方式，就是独自一人坐在屏幕前，看着许多人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um with purpose so I'm a huge believer in hybrid working I'm a huge believer in different types of work that happen at home and in the office I'm a huge believer in how it helps with inclusion especially as a woman with two young kids um but I think we are underestimating how we are losing a skill that it's a weird thing to say that people are uncomfortable being in a room with a group of people because is they're so their experience their way they're entering the workplace is being on their own in front of a screen looking at lots of people</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 学校里有更多的社交焦虑，例如，因此有很多缺勤。我现在在飞机上也看到了，也许只是我个人感受，但人们戴着耳塞，不想和我说话。这和信任有关系吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well there's more social angst at at schools for instance um a lot of absence because of it I see it now on planes well that me maybe just because of me but uh people put their air plugs in don't want to talk to me uh has this anything to do with trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我不知道这是否与信任有关，但学习如何培养和促进信任，以及在不适的时刻形成信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if that's got something to do with trust but learning how to nurture trust and facil itate trust and also to be a lot of trust forms in moments of discomfort</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 你是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you mean</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，深层信任是在那些脆弱的时刻形成的，在那些事情出错的时刻，在那些你真正倾听某人并试图解决问题的时刻。我没有这方面的数据，但这些时刻在虚拟环境中是如何产生的呢？你必须真正倾听并为那个人出现。所以我担心我们正在进入这些微观的、交易性的工作关系时刻，但那些深层信任的时刻并没有真正形成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so deep trust forms in those moments of vulnerability in those moments where something's got gone wrong when those moments where you're really listening to someone and trying to solve a problem and I don't have the data on this but how do those moments come about virtually where you really have to listen and show up for that person um so I worry that we're sort of going into these like micro moments of transactional relation relationships at work but these moments of deep trust aren't really forming</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么这些是什么样的时刻？我的意思是，在建立信任方面，有哪些关键时刻需要注意？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what kind of moments are are these I mean what are the key moments to look out for in terms of building trust when something's gone wrong</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 当事情出错时。那可能是一个项目失败了，一项投资出了问题，人们多年来一直在努力的事情在市场上没有成功，或者某人收到了负面媒体报道，他们的声誉受到攻击。有太多不同的原因和诱因，但关键是当某人感到**暴露**（Exposed）的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when something's gone wrong um so that could be that a project has failed an investment has gone wrong um something people have been working on for years hasn't taken in the market um it could be someone's received a negative piece of media that their reputation's under attack there's so many different um reasons and causes but it's that moment where someone feels exposed</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，为了建立信任，你该怎么做？你倾听他们，你理解他们。我的意思是，你究竟该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and to build trust then what do you do you so that you listen to them you understand them I mean just what do you do</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，第一件事实际上是识别那个人真正的信任问题是什么。通常，当出现信任问题时，你正在失去或担心失去一些东西。每当人类认为自己将失去一些东西时，他们的本能就是想要控制局面，对吧？这就是为什么有时我们在危机中的膝跳反应不是一个好的反应，因为它是一种“让我重新掌控”的感觉，就是“让我重新掌控”。所以，你如何帮助那个个体首先识别出真正的信任问题是什么，真正危及的是什么，这实际上是第一步。因为你作为旁观者，一个情感上超脱于情境之外的人的解读，将与身处情感危机中的个人或领导者非常不同，对吧？他们正处于水深火热之中。所以，我从帮助他们识别真正的问题开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well the first thing is is actually identifying what the real trust issue is for that person so often when there's a trust issue there's something that you're losing or you're worried about losing um and whenever humans think they're going to lose something their instinct is to want to control things right so that's why sometimes our knee-reaction in a crisis is not a good reaction because it's that feeling of put me back in control just put me back in control and so how you help that other individual identify First of what is the real trust issue here what is really at stake that's actually the first step because your interpretation of that as someone emotionally removed from the situation is going to be very different from the individual or the leader that is in the midst of the emotional crisis right so they're in the midst of the heat so that's where I start is actually helping them identify what the real issue is</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 其次，他们需要感到被看见，被倾听。然后，许多领导者和组织犯的错误是，他们正确地完成了倾听阶段，但之后却没有后续行动，没有支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then the secondly thing they need to they need to feel seen they need to feel heard and then where many leaders and organizations go wrong is they get that listening phase right and then there is no action there's no support that follows through</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 应该采取什么样的行动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what kind of action should me</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 它是如何真正支持那个人的，对吧？所以他们需要什么样的支持？他们需要什么样的专家支持？他们需要谁在他们身边？需要从他们那里拿走什么？需要给他们什么？所以风险甚至不必那么高。你可能也经历过这种情况，对吧？当你经历一次绩效评估时，有人收集了令人难以置信的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's it's how is literally that person held through this right so what kind of support do they need what kind of specialist support do they need who do they need at their side H how what needs to be taken away from them um what needs to be given to them um so the stakes don't even have to be that high you've probably sat through this right where you go through a performance review and um someone collects incredible feedback</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我讨厌它们。你讨厌它们吗？

<details>

**Rachel:** 我讨厌它们，因为我经历过一些非常糟糕的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hate them because I have had some really bad ones uh</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，在绩效评估中，别人对你说的最糟糕的话是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what's the worst thing that someone said in the performance review about you</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我完全一无是处，而且没有任何限定。嗯，有一长串我做错的事情。那是我第一份工作。我的意思是，那清单就像一卷卫生纸那么长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that I was just completely and utterly useless and there was no qualification well there was a whole long list of things I had done you know wrong it was my it was my first job I mean the list was as long as a you know a roll of toilet paper</p>

**Nikolai:** 你还记得清单上的一些事情吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you remember some of the things on the list</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 哦，当然记得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh totally yeah</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 所以我记得一件事，但他让我振作起来，我开始努力工作，从那时起我就一直在努力证明那个人是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I remember one but he got my you know I got my act together I kind of got my finger and I've worked hard ever since to uh prove the person wrong</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以你试图证明他们是错的，因为你生气了，还是你只是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you tried to prove them wrong because you were angry or you just no no</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 不，我只是意识到他们是对的。我确实很没用，我只是需要加快速度，表现出色，并交付成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's just like I realized they were right I had been pretty useless and I just needed to you know to speed up and uh and perform and and you know deliver stuff yeah</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 是的，我经历过一次绩效评估，老板告诉我我完全无法被雇佣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I had a performance review where a boss told me I was totally unemployable right</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 除了你进入学术界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um except when you went into academics</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 不，他说：“我这话其实是想当作一种赞美。”我说：“好吧，你得解释一下，对吧？我无法被雇佣，但这是一种赞美。”这实际上引发了一场非常有趣的讨论，那就是我的天性是进入系统、进入文化，并发现它们哪里出了问题。我想要修复问题，对吧？所以我当时关注的重点，当时我在咨询客户交付方面，是次于想要修复公司，对吧？但是，嗯，但他后来什么也没做，对吧？所以我现在坐在那里想：“我无法被雇佣，我无法被雇佣，我在这家公司做什么？”这就像是只有反馈而没有后续支持的例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no and I said and he said I kind of mean that as a compliment and I said okay you got a qualify that right I'm unemployable but that is a compliment and um it actually led to a really interesting discussion which is that you know my natural thing is to go into systems to go into cultures and to see where they're broken um I want to fix things right I can see so my focus on sort of this was when I was Consulting on client delivery was secondary to wanting to fix the company right was but anyway um but then he didn't do anything with it right like so I I'm now sitting there thinking I'm unemployable I'm unemployable what am I doing in this organization like that's that's an example of like feedback with no catch right no support no follow through</p>

**Nikolai:** 是的，我无法被雇佣，所以他也是对的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I am unemployable so he was right as well</p>

**Rachel:** 但，嗯，对我来说，你绝对可以被雇佣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so but well using eminently employable to me</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 但再多谈谈居家办公等等。所以，数字生产力追踪工具，他们使用它们，这很糟糕，对吧？所以他们会在一些国家使用它们，我们并没有真正，嗯，很正确地，不在我们公司使用它们。但它们对人们做了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but just um a bit more on um working from home and so on so digital productivity tracking tools like they use it's terrible right so they use that in in some countries we're not really you know quite rightly so and don't use them um uh in our company but what what do they do to people</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 它们很糟糕。我的意思是，首先，我认为如果你是一家公司，它有——我的意思是，这是一个光谱，对吧？有些公司正在追踪你的在线时间，对吧？有些公司甚至极端到使用摄像机，所以他们正在拍摄人们在做什么。还有一些公司监控人们查看的一切。我的意思是，这些都是低信任度的惊人信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they're awful I mean first of all I think if you're a company that has I mean and there's a spectrum right so there's some companies that are tracking your time online right um there's some companies that goes to the extrem of video cameras so they're filming what people are doing um others that are monitoring everything that people look at I mean these are all incredible signals of low trust um</p>

**Nikolai:** 这是监视，这是监视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's surveillance it's surveillance it's not monitoring it is surveillance right</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是监视，对吧？所以，你知道，嗯，我有一个问题是，你到底在测量什么？因为你并没有真正测量价值，你也没有真正测量生产力，你只是测量人们实际出现的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know um one of the things though I have an issue with is what are you actually measuring because you're not really measuring value you're not really measuring productivity you're just measuring how people physically show up</p>

**Nikolai:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是评价人类最糟糕的方式之一。这是从人们那里获得高质量工作最糟糕的方式。你基本上只是回到了工厂时代，人们打卡上班和下班。所以，嗯，看，这对组织来说是一个巨大的挑战。当你试图管理成千上万远程工作、不一定投入、不一定关心自己工作的人时，我非常理解。你如何监控这些人？我会说，如果你必须实施任何形式的监视系统，那么你就有文化问题，这源于缺乏信任。

<p class="english-text">and this is one of the worst ways to Value human beings it's the worst ways to get quality of work out of people you're just basically going back to factory days where people are clocking in and clocking out so um look it's it's a huge challenge for organizations I have a huge amount of empathy when you are trying to manage tens of thousands of people that are working remotely that aren't necessarily engaged that don't necessarily care about their jobs how do you monitor those people I would say if you have to implement any kind of surveillance system you've got a culture problem which stems from a lack of trust</p>

**Nikolai:** 把笔记本电脑带进会议室会怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what does it do to bring laptop into meetings</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是一个有趣的问题。嗯，这取决于情况。你知道，当你坐在那些会议室里，每个人都带着笔记本电脑，然后每个人都在笔记本电脑上打字。有些会议中，你知道，人们实际上在做笔记，因为他们抬头看，他们看起来仍然投入在会议中，他们把笔记本电脑当作会议中的工具。但当人们身在其中却心不在焉时，开会的意义何在？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh that's an interesting question um it depends so you know when you sit in those meetings and everyone has a laptop and then everyone is typing on that laptop and there's some meetings where you know people are actually taking notes because they're looking up they're looking like they're still engaged in the meeting and they're using that laptop as a tool within that meeting M but when people are there and they're not there what's the point of having the meeting um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我的意思是，我认为在这方面，笔记本电脑比手机更糟糕。我认为，我有时和人们坐在一起，我真的想把他们的手机从他们手里抢过来扔出窗外，因为我认为人们没有意识到他们正在无礼。我真的不认为他们意识到他们正在发出信号，表明你不如他们手中的东西重要。你可能也遇到过这种情况，对吧？你正在和某人说话，然后他们低下头开始滑动，他们甚至没有打字，对吧？他们想说的是：你很无聊，你不重要，我分心了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean I think the laptops are worse than the phones in that sense um I think there is I I sometimes sit with people and I literally want to grab the phone out of their hand and throw it out the window because I don't think people realize that they're being rude I I really don't think they realize that they're signaling that you are not as important as the thing that's in their hand and you've probably had this situation right where you're talking to someone and then they look down and they start swiping they're not even typing right and what they're saying is you're boring you're not important I've disengaged</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 真正的爱是与某人在一起时，不看手机。

<details>

### 速度与信任：一个悖论

**Nikolai:** 现在我有一个口号，那就是“速度是一种心态”，我认为速度现在非常重要。你对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um now I have a I have a a slogan which is that speed is a mindset and I think speed is very important now so what do you mean by that</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，这意味着你几乎可以把所有事情都做得比你计划的快一倍，或者说，组织中的速度，你接电话的速度，你回复电子邮件的速度。我认为有趣的是，你做事越快，你节省的时间就越多。如果我在一分钟内回复一封电子邮件，是的，它可能只有一句话。如果需要一个小时，它就需要一个段落。如果需要一天，它就需要一页。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh that's that you can do pretty much everything twice as fast as as uh as you had planned or uh speed in organization how quickly you pick up the phone how quickly you answer an email uh and I think it's interesting the quicker you do things the more time you save if I answer an email within one minute yes it can be one sentence yes if it takes an hour it needs to be a paragraph and if it's a day it needs to be a page</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 同意。所以你通过快速响应来节省时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">agreed so you save time by being quick responsive</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 绝对如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 现在我读到你曾在某个地方说过，速度是信任的敌人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I read that you say somewhere that speed is the enemy of trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is that</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以我会争辩说，我认为你那里谈论的是**响应性**（Responsiveness），而不是……所以你可能会很快回复电子邮件，因为你所说的是，在空白中，对方正在猜测你在想什么，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I would argue I think what you're talking about there is responsiveness versus so you you you may respond quickly to emails um because what you're saying is in the Gap the person is wondering what you're thinking right</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么你为什么不解释一下，为什么你认为它是一句话而不是一个段落？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you then why do you just explain to me why you think it's a sentence versus a paragraph</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，因为你会对我回复的速度感到印象深刻。所以我不需要用我所说的话来打动你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well because you'd be impressed by you'd be impressed by how quick how quickly I answer so I don't need to impress you by what I say</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 有趣。好吧。但你在那一句话的回答中考虑得有多周到？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">interesting okay but how thoughtful you thoughtful are you in the one sentence answer</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 总是，当然，非常周到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">always of course very thoughtful always thought</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 对吧？所以如果你匆忙行事，就会有问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right so if you rush that there would be a problem</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 当然。好吧，所以人们对你的回应速度有所不同。我不是说这对信任不好。我说的意思是，当人们不放慢速度，不思考他们正在分享的信息时，就会有问题。所以，你知道，有时有人给你发一篇文章，你知道他们没有读过那篇文章，但这种情况我经常遇到。他们会说“这会对你很有用”，你深入研究后发现“这是垃圾”，对吧？因为他们看到了标题，看到了文章的来源。这就是速度成为信任的敌人的一个例子。当你过快地给出信息时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">sure okay so there's a difference in sort of how quickly you respond to people I'm not saying that's bad for trust what I'm saying is when people don't slow down and they don't think about the information that they're sharing so you know sometimes someone sends you an article and you know they have not read that article but this happens to me all the time I think will be really useful to you and you dig in and you're like this is rubbish right because they they've seen the headline they've seen where it's being written that's an example of speed being the enemy of trust um when you give your information away too quickly</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，有罪，因为有时我想要那个东西，但你知道当你只是“接受”或“拒绝”时，我有时会尝试按下“拒绝”，然后我就会陷入循环。所以我只是接受它，因为我想要得到那个东西，对吧？我真的对这种**摩擦**（Friction）感到恼火。银行，你知道，当你收到那些短信时，比如“UPS无法投递你的包裹，请点击这里”，你只是想要那个包裹，所以你点击了那里，然后你突然把你的信用卡信息给了骗子，对吧？当你没有放慢速度，当这些体验中没有摩擦时——我称之为**信任暂停**（Trust Pause）——这真的会损害信任，因为你太容易地放弃了你的信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so guilty because sometimes I want the thing but you know when you're just like accept or reject and I try to go to press reject sometimes and then I get caught in a loop so I just accept it because I want to get to the thing right I'm really annoyed by the friction um banking um you know when you get those texts and it's like um UPS cannot deliver your package please click here and you just want to you want the package so you click there and you've suddenly given your credit card details to a scam right when you're not slowing down when there is no friction in those experiences what I call a trust pause that's really damaging for trust because you're giving your trust away too easily</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这是一个巨大的问题，因为技术想要做的就是消除这种摩擦，对吧？你和大多数企业家交谈，你和体验设计师交谈，他们试图做什么？让事情高效、快速、无缝。如果一切都**无摩擦**（Frictionless），我们对摩擦的容忍度就会下降。我现在经常看到这种情况，对吧？你知道，超市里的自助结账机，设计得很糟糕，对吧？每三件商品，你就会遇到问题，然后有人过来帮你，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and this is a huge problem because what technology wants to do is remove that friction right you speak to most entrepreneurs you talk to experience designers what they trying to do make things efficient make them quick make them seamless well if everything is frictionless our tolerance for friction goes down now I see this all the time right you know um self-service checkouts in the supermarket terrible design right like CU every three things you hit the person is coming to help you right now</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 这只是一个例子。我前几天在超市里，这个人对着机器大喊大叫，然后他猛击机器，因为他无法结账。我就想：“老兄，你正在买一瓶11升的伏特加，或者别的什么，对吧？总得有人说你够年龄买它吧。猛击机器是没用的。”他说：“我得赶紧离开这里，为什么这是自助结账机？”这只是我们经常看到的一个例子。我们对任何形式的摩擦都没有耐心，因为一切都变得如此按需、如此快速。所以当我们被放慢速度时，我们不喜欢它。但放慢速度有助于我们思考：这个人、这个产品、这条信息、我将要寄出的这笔钱，它真的值得我的信任吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this is just an example I was in the supermarket the other day and this guy is like shouting at the machine right and then he's Bang the machine because he can't check out and I'm like dude you're trying to buy an 11 liter bottle of vodka whatever it is right someone has to say that you're old enough to buy it hitting the machine is not going to help he's like I I got to get out of here I'm why is this a self-service checkout it's just one example we see all the time like we have no patience for any kind of friction because everything has become so on demand so quick and so when we are slowed down we don't like it but slowing down helps us think about is this person is this product is this piece of information is this money I'm going to send is it actually worthy of my trust</p>
</details>

### 同理心与信任：好奇心的力量

**Nikolai:** 那么同理心和信任之间有什么关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what's the relationship between empathy and Trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，**同理心**（Empathy）非常重要。当我们审视**可信度**（Trustworthiness），即信任的行为层面时，我们谈论一个人的**能力**（Capability）和**品格**（Character）。在品格方面，社会科学已经研究了50多年，为什么你信任某些人，为什么你给予他们信任。在品格方面，有两个高阶特质：第一个是**正直**（Integrity），第二个是同理心。它们具有同等重要性，嗯，实际上它们并不具有同等重要性，这取决于具体情况。所以，如果你是一名教师，你需要非常高的同理心；如果你是一名律师，你需要非常高的正直。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so empathy is huge so when we look at um trustworthiness um the behavioral side of trust um we talk about someone's capability and someone's character and on the character side um social sciences have been studying for over 50 years why do you trust certain people why do you give them their trust and on the character side there are two high order traits the first is integrity and the second is empathy they carry equal import well actually they don't carry equal importance it depends on the situation so if you are a teacher you need very high empathy um if you're a lawyer you need very high integrity um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 然后在能力方面，我们有**可靠性**（Reliability）和**胜任力**（Competence）。有趣的是，在不同的情况下，你需要不同程度的这些特质。但同理心很有趣。所以当你问领导者：“你为什么认为同理心很重要？”他们会说：“嗯，我认为这是因为它向人们表明我是一个好的倾听者。”或者“我认为它表明我关心他人。”真正有趣的是，最有同理心的领导者通常在**好奇心**（Curiosity）方面得分很高。我发现这很吸引人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then on the capability side we have reliability and competence and it's interesting because you need different amounts of these traits in different situations but empathy is interesting so when you say to leaders why do why do you think empathy is important they'll say well I think it's because it shows people that I'm a good listener this why here or um I think it demonstrates that I care and what's really interesting is that the most empathetic leaders often score very high on curiosity h and I find this fascinating</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么为什么两者之间存在这种关系呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so why why is there a relationship there</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 因为他们会提问。你所说的对他们来说很有趣，你所想的对他们来说很重要。他们对差异持开放态度，对分歧持开放态度。所以我认为同理心，这只是我的观点，以一种无益的方式被重新定义了。所以如果你是一位领导者，你认为同理心是“我必须证明我能倾听成千上万的人，我能设身处地为他们着想”，那很难规模化。但如果作为一位领导者，你必须证明你充满好奇心，你真正对人们的故事、他们的出身、他们为什么为你工作、他们想要实现什么、他们想要如何影响公司、他们有什么想法感兴趣，我认为这更容易模仿同理心。所以如果人们认为你充满好奇心，他们也会认为你很有同理心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because they ask questions mhm what you have to say is interesting to them what you think is important to them they're open to difference they're open to disagreement so I think empathy and this is just my opinion has sort of been rebranded in a way that isn't helpful so if you're a leader and you think of empathy I've got to demonstrate I can hear and listen to thousands of people that I'm in their shoes that's what empathy that's really hard to scale if as a leader you have to demonstrate that you are curious that you're generally interested in people's stories where they've come from why they're working from you what they want to achieve how they want to impact the company what they think that's I think much easier to sort of emulate the empathy so if people perceive you as curious they also think that you have a lot of EMP</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 是的，这表明你关心他们，他们也更信任你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah it's a sign that you care they and they trust you more yeah</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 是的，因为你是在说“你对我来说很重要，你所说的很重要”。我的意思是，你是一个好奇的人，你是否尝试过对别人这样做，只是问他们一些问题，让他们觉得“我以前没听过这个，我以前从未被问过这个问题”？这些实际上是发出同理心信号的方式，表明你在这里，你很专注，你对那个人感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because you're saying you're important to me what you have to say is I mean you're you're a curious person is this something that you try to do with people is just ask them questions where they go I haven't heard that before I've never been asked that before like those are actually ways of signaling empathy that you're there you're present you're interested in that person</p>
</details>

### 一致性与问责制：建立持久信任

**Nikolai:** 你在最近的通讯中写道，为什么**一致性**（Consistency）很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why is consistency important you write that in a in a recent newsletter</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，嗯，我们读过詹姆斯·克利尔（James Clear）的《原子习惯》（"Atomic Habits"），对吧？里面有一句话，他说：“强度造就伟大的故事，但一致性带来进步。”他是在习惯的语境下说的，但他也可以是在谈论信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um it's a we read Atomic habits yeah so there's a line in there um by James CLE where he says um intensity makes a great story but it's consistency that leads to progress now he's talking about that in the context of habits but he could be writing about trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以领导者，不只是领导者，那些以强烈、激烈方式出现的人——这可能发生在家庭情境中，对吧？你知道，那个从不接电话的亲戚，你不能指望他们，但他们会在圣诞节带着大礼物出现，那是强度。或者那个经常迟到、非常不可预测、情绪总是变化的领导者，但给他们一个领导力峰会，他们就会出现，对吧？那是强度。但真正的信任形成于那些始终如一地出现的人——朋友、祖父母，无论他们是谁——他们会记住你六个月前说的那些对他们很重要的小事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so leaders not just leaders people who show up in a big intense way so this could be in a family situation right so you know the relative that never picks up the phone you can't rely on them but they show up for Christmas with the big gift right that's intensity or the leader that is often late is really unpredictable their energy changes all the time but give them a Leadership Summit and they are they are there right they're going to show up that's intensity but where real trust forms is the person the friend the grandparent whoever it may be who shows up consistently that remembers the small things that you said six months ago that were important to them</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我想说的是，人们常常将这个想法混淆，认为你可以是一个强烈的人，也可以是一致的。你可以有糟糕的日子，也可以有好的日子。你可以有高效率的日子，完成很多事情，也可以有低效率的日子，什么也没做。你仍然可以在你对待他人的方式上保持一致。所以我所说的一致性是，人们知道对你有什么期望，他们知道与你相处的体验会是怎样的。而那些不一致的领导者、家庭成员、朋友，我们就会想：“我就是不知道这个人会如何出现，他们会如何反应，他们会如何回应，他们会出现吗？”这真的会损害信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what I want to what people often conflate with this idea is you can be an intense person and you can be consistent you can have bad days and you can have good days you can have high striz days where you achieve loads of things and low stri days where you get nothing done you can still be consistent in the way you show up for people so what I mean by consistency is people know what to expect of you they know what the experience of you is going to be and it's those inconsistent leaders family members friends we like I just I don't know how is this person going to show up how they going to react how are they going to respond are they going to show up that really damages trust</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 当事情出错，当我们犯错时，这对信任有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when things go wrong when we make mistakes what does that do to trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 你认为当你问这个问题时，你指的是什么样的错误？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what kind of mistakes you think you have when you ask that question</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 嗯，可能是各种各样的事情。嗯，我是一名首席执行官，我犯了一个大错误，我在整个组织面前承认了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh well it could be all kinds of things um well let I know I'm a CEO I made a big mistake I admitted in front of the whole organization so I think if you if there is an</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以我认为，如果有一个**承认**（Admission），然后与这个承认相关联的是**问责制**（Accountability），因为有时领导者可以承认错误，但他们之后并不真正承担错误，对吧？所以，嗯，“我负责，我承担责任”，然后非常重要的是，“我们将采取什么措施来改变这一点？”所以，为了修复信任，问责制必须转化为改变和行动。许多公司犯的错误是，我们不……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">admission and then tied to that admission there is accountability um because sometimes leaders can admit mistakes but they don't actually own the mistake afterwards right so um I'm responsible I'm accountable and then really important this is what we're going to do to change this so accountability to fixed trust has to move to change an action um and where many companies make the mistake and we don't</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 但如果你这样做，人们会更信任你还是更不信任你？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm so but if you so if you do that do people trust you more or less</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 他们会更信任你。所以它实际上可以对信任产生积极影响，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they can trust you more so it can actually have a positive effect on trust yeah um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 现在，它适得其反的地方是，它可能是一个领导者，可能是一个整个公司，它可能是一个小小的信任违背，也可能是一场巨大的危机。我们经常看到这种情况，他们指向系统。所以，嗯，“哦，这与我或任何个人无关，是算法的问题，或者是产品故障，或者数据出了问题。”你看到公司经历这些，对吧？无论是波音（Boeing），还是脸书（Facebook）/Meta，对吧？这些公司很难从这些信任危机中恢复过来，直到信任的**品格**（Character）方面出现问责制，而不是**能力**（Capability）方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now where it backfires is it can be a leader it can be an entire company uh it can be a small trust breach or a massive crisis and we we see this all the time they point to the system so um oh it had nothing to do with me or any individuals it was the algorithm or it was a product failure or something happened to the data and you see companies go through this right whether it's Boeing whether it's Facebook meta right it's very hard for those companies to recover from those trust crises until there is accountability in the character side of trust not the capability side of trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以这不是“我们要修复产品，我们要修复系统，我们要修复算法”，而是“你将在文化中做些什么，特别是在**正直**（Integrity）方面，以确保这种情况不会再次发生？”让我惊讶的是，公司需要多长时间才能达到这一点，说：“你知道吗，这不仅仅是一个能力问题，实际上在我们的文化和品格中存在一些问题，关于我们如何被衡量，我们如何被激励，我们如何相互问责，我们的报告结构，监管，无论是什么，问题都在那里，而不是在产品、服务或系统中。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's not we're going to fix the product we're going to fix the system we're going to fix the algorithm it's what are you going to do in the culture particularly around the Integrity piece that ensures me this isn't going to happen again and it amazes me how long it can take companies to arrive at that point of saying you know what this wasn't just a capability issue actually there's something in the culture and the character of the way we're measured the way we're incentivized the way you know we're held accountable to each other our reporting structures regulation whatever it might be the problem lies there not in the product or the service or the system</p>
</details>

### 机构与个人如何建立信任资本

**Nikolai:** 谈到我工作的基金，我们代表全体挪威人民管理资本。你认为建立信任的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on to the the fund where where I work um now we run capital on behalf of the whole Norwegian population what do you think is the key to build trust</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 嗯，让我把问题抛回给你，因为我有一个答案，但我对你的想法很感兴趣，因为你一定花时间思考过这个问题。责任，对吧？我敢说，这可能是你思考最多或应该思考最多的事情，对吧？你认为最重要的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well let me let me turn the ti tables on you because I have an answer but I'm intrigued in your because you must spend time thinking about this questione responsibility right and I would argue it's probably the thing you think about or should think about the most right what do you think is the most important thing</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 嗯，我认为是建立关于基金和我们所做工作的知识，因为我们看到，了解基金的人更信任我们。我们甚至看到，听我们播客的人比不听播客的人更信任基金。当我们看到不同年龄组等等时，知识建立信任这一点始终如一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think it is to build knowledge because about the fund and what we do because what we see is that people who know about the fund they trust us more um we even see that the people who listen to our podcast trust the fund more than the people who don't listen to the podcast MH um when we see various age groups and so on it's just consistent that knowledge builds trust</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 是的，我们需要保持一致，我们需要按照我们的职责行事，我们需要正确沟通，当然，我们需要行为得当，你知道，我们需要做正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes uh we need to be consistent we need to be uh we need to do things according to our mandate uh and we need to communicate correctly and of course we need to behave you know we need to do the right things</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以我听起来，你说的第一件事是**熟悉度**（Familiarity）。我们倾向于信任我们更熟悉的事物。这可能是因为你正在把未知的事物变得为人所知。所以这是第一步。你说的第二件事，我认为是**开放性**（Openness）。你不是在谈论透明度……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the way I hear that is the first thing that you're talking about is familiarity yeah so um we tend to trust things that we are more familiar with um and that can be because what you're doing is you're taking something that is unknown and you're making it known to people so that's the first step um the second thing that you're talking about I think is openness so you're not talking about transparency what you're talking about is funds are often well it is also transparency</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 嗯，它也是透明度，因为我们是世界上最透明的基金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because we are the most transparent Fund in the world</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 在什么意义上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in what sense</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我们向所有人公开信息，我们告诉所有人我们如何在各种年度会议上投票，诸如此类的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that we make information available to everybody that we are uh that we tell everybody how we are voting at various uh annual meetings the these kind of things</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 好的，我们稍后再讨论这个问题，因为我很想知道是否有你不能告诉人们的事情，如果他们想知道但你没有告诉他们。我们稍后再讨论。我会说你谈论的行为部分是**正直**（Integrity）部分。所以我会说，这与开放性部分有关，基金的问题在于99.9%的人不知道它们是如何运作的，对吧？它们是这些由有权有势的富人管理的神秘事物。它们如何赚钱？但更重要的是，这些钱如何为我服务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay let's come back to that CU it be interested in if if there's anything you can't tell people if you don't tell people and they want to know but let's come back to that and I would say the behavioral piece that you're talking about is the Integrity piece so I would say and this goes with the openness piece the thing with funds is that 99.9% of people don't know how they work right they're these mysterious things that are run by powerful wealthy people how do they make money but more importantly how does that money serve me</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以这又回到了我们最初开始的地方，对吧？与政客和政府一样，基金的利益如何与挪威公民的利益保持一致，对吧？不是富人和精英，而是普通人，他们相信基金在某种程度上正在造福他们的生活。这也是我们犯的一个错误，我们没有讲述这些故事，对吧？所以我们讲述增长的故事，我们讲述我们如何很好地管理财富的故事，但这些财富如何积极地影响人们的生活，它解锁了什么，它使挪威能够做什么，这如何更好地影响我的生活——这部分在信任故事中常常被忽略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this gets back to where we began right with politicians and government like how do the funds interest align with the citizens of Norway right not the wealthy and the elite but the average person that they believe that in some way the fund is benefiting their life and it's a mistake we also we don't tell those stories right so we tell the stories of growth um we tell the stories of how well we're managing the wealth but how that wealth is positively impacting people's lives what it unlocks what it enables Norway to do how that impacts my life for the better that's the piece that often gets missed in the trust story</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以，嗯，内部的人会谈论绩效，对吧？所以基金表现得非常好，因此我们应该被信任。但这些百分点，这些增长，对普通人来说没有任何意义。所以信任的桥梁是“这对我有什么好处？”的叙事，这如何造福我？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um the people on the inside they will talk about performance right so the fund is performing really well and therefore we should be trusted but those percentage points points those increases they don't mean anything to the average person so the trust bridge is The Narrative of what's in it for me how does this benefit me</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 谈到我们有成千上万的年轻人正在听这个播客，他们应该怎么做才能让人们更信任他们？当他们加入一份新工作时，或者在任何情况下，关键是什么？你20岁，正在思考你的职业和生活，你如何建立这种信任？那是**信任资本**（Trust Capital）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">talking which we have tens of thousands of young people listening to this podcast what should they do so that people trust them more when they're joining a new job or and and in any situation what's the key you are 20 years old and you're thinking about your career and your life how do you build that trust that's trust Capital</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 有趣。嗯，我会说，在你职业生涯的早期，你正在努力展示你的**能力**（Capability），它与你的**品格**（Character）处于同等地位。你的能力会让你获得面试机会，而你的品格会让你获得工作。你经常看到的是，这不仅仅是年轻人的错，也是面试他们的人的错，它变成了关于他们的经验，他们有资格做什么。双方通常不沟通他们的兴趣、动机、意图，他们为什么真正想要那个职位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">interesting um so I would say early on in your career um you're trying to demonstrate your capability on equal footing with your character your capability is what's going to get you an interview your character is what's going to get you the job and what you see often and this isn't just the fault of young people it's the people interviewing them um it becomes about their experience what they're qualified to do and both sides often don't communicate their interests their motives their intentions why do they really want that position um</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 所以我认为在面试情境中，当你试图展示你是谁以及你能带来什么时，思考能力方面和品格方面非常重要。然后在你职业生涯的早期，我真诚地认为最重要的特质之一是**可靠性**（Reliability）。它是你随着时间的推移如何表现和行为。你和领导者以及管理者交谈，他们会说他们最讨厌的是**不一致性**（Inconsistency），对吧？比如：“哦，我不知道我是否能相信他们能完成这件事”或者“他们总是迟到”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think in an interview situation um when you're trying to demonstrate who you are and what you can bring thinking about that capability side and thinking about that character side is really important and then in the early stages of your career um I honestly think one of the most important traits is reliability it's how you show up and behave over time and you talk to leaders um and this is anecdotal and managers and they'll say their pet peeve is inconsistency right like oh I don't know if I can trust them that they're going to get this thing done or they're always late or</p>
</details>

**Rachel:** 我现在很少和人们交谈时，他们会滔滔不绝地赞扬他们的团队和这些群体，通常都是围绕着职场中不断变化的态度而抱怨。以前人们能找到工作就很幸运，现在他们认为我们能拥有他们就很幸运。权力转移了，雇主和雇员之间的关系永远不会回到从前，你必须理解这种权力动态才能真正理解信任是如何运作的。所以这种想法，认为现在年轻人会对组织、对领导者谦恭有礼，他们会每天出现并证明他们真的想要那份工作，这根本不是权力和信任运作的方式。所以作为一个年轻人，我不是说要谦恭有礼，但如果你可靠且一致，这种特质真的会闪耀出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I rarely speak to people these days and they Rave about their teams and these cohort it's usually a list of complaints around changing attitudes in the workplace and it used to be that people were lucky to have a job here and now they think we're lucky to have them and the power shifted that relationship between employer and employee is never going back and you have to understand that P power Dynamic to really understand how trust works so this idea that now a young person is going to be deferential to the organization to the leader that they're going to show up every day and demonstrate they really want that job it's just not the way power and Trust works so as a young person I'm not saying mean differential but if you are reliable and you are consistent that trait will really shine through</p>
