### 渣打银行的独特之处

**Nicolola Tangan**: 大家好，我是**挪威南方财富基金**的CEO **Nicolola Tangan**。今天我邀请到了**渣打银行**集团CEO **Bill Winters**。渣打银行是全球最具特色的银行之一，总部设在**伦敦**，但大部分业务都在**亚洲**、**非洲**和**中东**。我们持有该公司超过2%的股份，价值10亿美元，我们是非常自豪的股东。Bill，渣打银行于1853年在**孟买**、**加尔各答**和**上海**开设了第一批办事处，那是非常久远的事情了。你担任CEO已有10年，这只占银行历史的5%。那么，是什么让渣打银行如此特别呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Hi everyone, I'm **Nicolola Tangan**, the CEO of the **Norwegian Southern Wealth Fund** and today I'm joined by **Bill Winters**, the group CEO of **Standard Chartered Bank**, one of the world's most distinctive banks headquartered in **London**. You have most of your activities in **Asia**, **Africa**, and the **Middle East**. And we own more than 2% of the company worth a billion dollars. We are really proud shareholders. So, Bill, the bank opened its first offices far away in **Mumbai**, **Kolkata**, and **Shanghai** in 1853. Long time ago, and you've been CEO for 10 years, which is only 5% of the...

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 是的，首先很高兴来到这里，谢谢邀请。你说得对，**渣打银行**最初实际上是**非洲标准银行**，始于**南非**的**伊丽莎白港**。而**印度、中国和澳大利亚特许银行**的第一家分行在**加尔各答**。显然，最初是两家银行，直到1969年才合并，那也是很久以前的事了。它们都是为了资助帝国贸易而设立的。这些仍然是我们的根基。人们有时称我们为新兴市场银行，但这不太准确，因为我们在**美国**和**欧洲**都有庞大的业务，而且**香港**和**新加坡**等地也不再是新兴市场了。或者他们称我们为贸易银行，这倒是真的。我们确实是一家贸易银行，而且是**亚洲**第二大贸易银行，**亚洲**当然是世界上最大的贸易中心。但实际上，我们是一家“连接者银行”，我们只是连接市场与市场，连接人与人，因为我们有多个本土市场。吸引我加入**渣打银行**的正是这种独特的连接文化，它没有单一的本土市场。当然，**英国**在很多方面是我们的本土市场，是我们起步和总部所在地。**香港**是我们最大的单一市场。**香港**和**中国大陆**日益成为一个单一市场，是迄今为止我们最大的利润来源。**新加坡**是我们的主要运营中心。**印度**是我们的运营中心，同时我们也是**印度**的一家大银行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Yeah, first it's great to be here. Thanks for having me. So you're right. **Standard Chartered** actually started as a **Standard Bank of Africa**. It was started in **Port Elizabeth** in **South Africa**. And the **Charter Bank of India, China and Australia**, which first branch in **Kolkata**. And obviously at the outset it was two banks. It only came together in 1969, still a long time ago, but to finance the empire, it was to finance trade within the empire. And those are still our roots. And people sometimes refer to us as an emerging markets bank. That's not quite right because we have big operations in the **US** and **Europe**. And I'm not sure that places like **Hong Kong** and **Singapore** are emerging markets anymore. Or they refer to us as a trade bank, which is true. We are a trade bank and the second largest trade bank in **Asia**, of course, which is the biggest trading center of the world. But really, we're a connector bank. We just connect markets to markets and people to people because we have multiple home markets. And what attracted me to **Standard Chartered** was this unique culture of being a connector with no single home market. That of course the **UK** is our home market in many ways, is where we started and where we're headquartered. **Hong Kong** is our biggest single market. **Hong Kong, China**, which is increasingly a single market, is by far our biggest profit source. **Singapore** is our major operational hub. **India** is our operation center. And then we're a big bank in **India** as well.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 那么，你们的客户是谁呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: But who are your clients then?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们的客户大约三分之二是企业和机构客户，包括政府。他们几乎都是**跨国公司**。如果不是跨国公司，他们就不太需要我们。当然，我们也可以与一些本地客户打交道，但大多数是跨国公司。他们有一些跨境联系。另外三分之一是零售客户。所有零售业务都在**亚洲**、**中东**和**非洲**，但企业业务是真正的全球性业务。客户利用我们来连接他们与市场和投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Our clients, so roughly two-thirds of our businesses are our corporate and institutional clients, including governments. They're almost all multinational. If they're not multinational, they don't really need us. And of course we can deal with some local clients as well, but for the most part they're multinational. They have some cross-border nexus. One-third is retail. All of the retail is **Asia**, **Middle East** and **Africa**, but the corporate is truly global. And the clients use us to connect them to markets and investments.

</details>

### 总部设在伦敦的原因

**Nicolola Tangan**: 为什么你们的总部仍然设在这里？你们所有的业务都离得很远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Why are you still headquartered here? You got all your activities so far away.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 是的，这是一个好问题，我们也会问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Yeah, it's a question. It's a good question and we ask...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 这也不是你第一次被问到这个问题了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: It's not the first time you got it either.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 不，不是第一次。你知道吗？我们时不时会反思这个问题。首先，我们是一家相当复杂的银行，难以监管。而**英国监管机构**非常老练，他们长期以来一直在管理全球性银行。特别是对我们来说，我们积极参与金融市场、衍生品等，这些实际上很难监管。所以**英格兰银行**非常老练。其次，**英国**一直是一个出色的金融中心，拥有基础设施。它的时区也很好，因为我们在**非洲**、**西欧**和**美洲**都有业务，**英国**的时区很合适。不过，我们的名字印在**香港**的钞票上。我们最大的股东是**新加坡**的**淡马锡**。我们不想在两者之间做出选择。当然，你也可以考虑其他地点。如今，**新加坡**和**香港**也能监管我们，因为它们也变得非常老练。20年前，我不确定它们能否做到，但现在我们已经牢牢扎根在这里了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: No, not the first time. Do you know what? So when we reflect on this from time to time, we say first of all, we're quite a complex bank, difficult to regulate. And the **UK regulators** are extremely sophisticated. So they've been managing global banks for a long time. So they, especially for us, we deal actively in financial markets, derivatives and things like that that are quite difficult to regulate actually. So the **Bank of England** is extremely sophisticated. Second, the **UK** has always been a fantastic financial center. So it's got the underlying infrastructure. It obviously is a good time zone because we're active throughout **Africa** and in the west **Europe** and **Americas** where the **UK** is fine. But you know, our name is on the banknotes in **Hong Kong**. Our largest shareholder is **Temasek** in **Singapore**. We don't ever want to have to choose between the two of them. So that's, and you can think about some other location. Today **Singapore** and **Hong Kong** could regulate us because they've become extremely sophisticated regulators as well. 20 years ago, I'm not sure they could, but in the meantime, we're firmly entrenched here.

</details>

### 为跨国公司提供的服务

**Nicolola Tangan**: 那么，如果我是一家跨国公司，在这些地方都有业务，你们能为我做什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: So now I'm an international company, and I've got businesses in all these places. What do you do for me?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们负责您的本地运营，为您在某些国家/地区的本地运营提供融资，在这些国家/地区，我们可能是您唯一能合作的银行。在其他国家/地区，我们可能是少数真正本地化的国际银行之一。所以，我们将负责您在这些本地市场的业务。我们还将把您连接到本地参与者，他们可能是您**供应链**的一部分，或者他们可能是您的分销商，或者他们可能是您的合作伙伴，或者有一天他们可能会收购您或收购您的一部分。所以，这就是我们为跨国公司提供的服务，我们为他们提供进入这些本地市场的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: We take care of your local operations, financing for your local operations in countries where in some cases we'll be the only bank that you could deal with. In others, we'll be one of the few international banks that's truly local. So we're going to take care of your business in those local markets. We're also going to connect you to local players who may be part of your **supply chain** or they may be your distributors or they may be your partners or one day they may buy you or buy part of you. So that's for the multinational companies. We're offering them access to these local markets.

</details>

### 银行的转型之路

**Nicolola Tangan**: 十年前你接管这家银行时，情况非常不同。当时是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: When you took over the bank 10 years ago, the state of affairs were very different. What did things look like back then?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 当时我离开了银行业。我曾在**摩根大通**工作。我成立了一个我们今天称之为私人信贷基金，当时我们只称之为资产管理公司。那很好，生活很不错。资产管理的生活是美好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: You know, I had left banking at that point. I had worked at **JP Morgan**. I had set up what today we would call a private credit fund. Then we just called it an asset manager. It was fine. It was a good life. You know, the asset management life is a good life.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 不总是如此，但有时是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Not always, but some...

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我会说那是一段美好的生活。我是这么记得的。然后我接到了**渣打银行**的电话。我在**摩根大通**工作期间对这家银行非常了解，因为**渣打银行**是我们的客户和合作伙伴。我们现在仍然是客户和合作伙伴。董事长说：“我们遇到麻烦了。”我说：“是的，我知道有些问题。”但他接着说：“我认为我们有一个非常好的基础业务，我们只需要把它清理干净。”当时非常清楚的问题主要是**合规问题**，主要涉及**美国**，但也涉及**英国**和其他地方。但同样清楚的是，也存在一些**信贷问题**。我想当时没有人意识到这些问题有多严重，我来的时候也没有意识到，尽管我做了尽职调查，我必须承认。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I'm going to say it's a good life. That's how I remember it. And then I got this call from **Standard Chartered**. I knew the bank pretty well from my time at **JP Morgan** because **Standard Chartered** was a client and a partner. That we're still clients and partners. And the chairman said, "We've got a problem." I said, "Yeah, I'm aware that there are some problems." But he said, "I think we've got a really good underlying franchise and we just need to clean it up." And the problems that they were very clear at that point were compliance problems largely with the **US**, but also with the **UK** and elsewhere. But it was also clear that there were some credit problems. I don't think anybody was aware how substantial the problems were, and I wasn't when I arrived, I have to confess, despite my due diligence.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 情况有多糟？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How bad were they?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们注销了银行账面股本的四分之一，并通过**供股**来弥补，这导致股价下跌。股价曾达到我宣布上任时价格的两倍，但后来又下跌了一半。所以现在已经下跌了75%。从高点下跌。是的，但我所下的赌注，我曾几次质疑，但我今天坚信它是正确的，那就是我们有一个非常好的基础业务，它非常有趣，谢谢你一开始就称之为“独特”。这是一个中性词，可以是独特的积极，也可以是独特的消极，但它确实是独特的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: We wrote off a quarter of the book equity of the bank and had to fill that up with the rights offering, which, you know, took the share price down. It had peaked at, you know, almost double the price that it was at when I was announced, but it dropped by another half again. So that's now 75% down. Peaked drop. So that's, yeah, but my the bet I made, which I questioned at a few points, but I fundamentally I'm sure today was right was that there was a really good underlying franchise with a really interesting and thank you for calling this distinct at the outset. That's a, it's a neutral term. It could be distinctively positive or negative, but it is in fact distinct. And...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 现在是积极的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: It's a positive now.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 现在是积极的。人们有时会怀疑它是否是积极的，因为有时独特会很昂贵，或者当你独特时很难扩大规模。但我认为我们是独特的，这种独特性是一种优势，我们可以利用这种优势，我们只是有一些需要解决的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: It is a positive now. And people have wondered at times whether it is a positive because sometimes it's expensive to be distinct. Or it's tough to get to scale when you're distinct. But I took the view that we were distinctive and that that distinction was a strength and that we could leverage that strength and that we just had some problems that we had to clean up.

</details>

### 复杂银行的重塑策略

**Nicolola Tangan**: 所以，你上任第一天，走进办公室说：“大家好，我是Bill Winters。我来拯救你们，让我们看看账本。哇，不太好。注销四分之一。必须引入新资本。”你如何着手修复如此庞大而复杂的事物？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: So first day in the office, you come in there and you say, "Hi guys, Bill Winter. I'm coming to save you and let's have a look at the books. Wow, not so good. Write off a quarter of that. Have to take in some new capital." Just how do you go about fixing something which is so big and complex?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们花了一点时间。我首先有幸在宣布任命到正式上任之间有三个月的过渡期。所以我只是一个观察者。当时我还在出售我之前的业务。我还在一些其他公司的董事会任职，我必须辞去这些职务。所以，过渡花了一点时间，这让我有机会在不必做决策的情况下进行了解。所以，在我宣布任命三个月后上任时，我对银行已经相当熟悉，我们可以直接投入工作。你知道，首要任务是组建团队。实际上，甚至在我们处理问题之前，我们执行团队中只有一个人是前任团队成员，我们留用了他。最初的核心团队中大约一半的人来自内部，但我们把他们提升了一两个组织级别，另一半来自外部。这花了一点时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: We took a little bit of time. We took I had the luxury first of all of having three months between the time that I was announced and the time that I started. So I was just an observer. I was also selling, as it happens, my previous business. I was on the board of some other companies that I had to step off. So it took a little bit of time to transition, which was which gave me a chance to understand without having to make decisions. So by the time I started three months after announcement, I was pretty familiar with the bank and we could get right down to business. You know, the first order was to was to pick the team actually, but even before we dealt with the problems. And there's one person that had been on the previous executive team that we carried over. About half the people that that formed the core team at the outset came from inside, but we bumped them up an organizational level or two. And the other half came from outside. Took a little bit of time.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 在那三个月里，你见了多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: During those three months, how many people did you meet with?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 哦，几百人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Oh, hundreds. Hundreds and...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 在银行内部工作并与人会面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Working inside the bank and meeting people.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 是的。我几乎每天都在，我花了几个星期的时间出差，去拜访**香港**、**新加坡**、**迪拜**、**首尔**等主要中心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I was in almost every day and I and I took weeks on the road to to go visit the the key centers in **Hong Kong**, **Singapore**, **Dubai**, **Seoul**.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你是如何挑选人才的？你如何判断谁是合适的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And how do you and how do you pick the people? How do you see who is fit?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 回顾那段时间，我并没有100%的成功率，但我很惊讶最初的直觉似乎是如此准确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I you know, when when I reflect back on that on that period, I didn't have a 100% success rate, but it was I'm surprised that the initial instincts were as correct as they seemed. What what...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你在寻找什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What were you looking for?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我首先寻找的是**正直**。当时公司存在非常严重的**控制漏洞**。不完全清楚所有这些控制漏洞是否都完全是诚实的。我没有太多证据表明存在大量不诚实行为，但我认为有一些自私行为的糟糕例子，我认为这在很大程度上导致了当时公司的状况。我希望确保我们有一个完全专注于团队而非专注于自身的团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I I was first and foremost was looking for integrity. You know, there had been I would say very substantial control lapses in the company. It wasn't completely clear whether all those control lapses were completely honest. And I don't have a lot of evidence that there was a lot of dishonesty, but there were some bad examples of self-serving behavior, I thought, and that had got I think that contributed a lot to to the state of the company at the time. And I wanted to make sure that that we had a team that was completely focused on the team and not focused on themselves.

</details>

### 内部人才与外部招聘

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你从外部引进了多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How many people did you bring in from the outside?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 对。第一位外部招聘的是**首席风险官**，这是一个非常自然的起点。我们公司银行的负责人也是从外部引进的，而零售银行的负责人则是我从内部提拔的。实际上，在我上任前，银行刚刚聘请了一位新的**首席财务官**，他是一位经验丰富的**沃达丰**首席财务官，他显然留了下来。银行也刚刚聘请了一位**总法律顾问**，主要负责清理与**美国**当局的混乱局面，他也非常出色。所以，我们一开始就有一些优秀的人才。事实上，银行刚刚聘请了一位**技术与运营主管**，他和我同一天开始工作。但我发现银行内部的人才实际上非常优秀，其中许多人服务时间很长，他们了解**渣打银行**的优点和缺点。但我也意识到那群人受到了“炮轰”。因为**渣打银行**的历史是，仅仅三年前，他们还是**伦敦金融城**的宠儿，以账面价值的数倍进行交易，后来跌至账面价值附近，再后来跌至账面价值的30%。但在2012年，他们是英雄，被告知他们很棒。当时有许多大投资者以高价投入大量资金，说你们很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Right. The first hire from the outside was a **chief risk officer**, which was a really natural place to start. It brought in a the head of our corporate bank came from outside, whereas the head of our retail bank I promoted from within. The bank actually had just hired a new **CFO** before I arrived, who had had a very experienced CFO from **Vodafone**, who obviously stayed. And they had just hired a **general counsel** to clean basically to clean up some of the mess with with the **US** authorities in particular, who's also very strong. So, so we had, you know, we had some good endowments at the outset. And in fact, the bank had just hired a **head of technology and operations** who started the same day, same day I did. But you what I found was that the talent in the bank was actually very very good and much of it long-serving and they understood what was really good about **Standard Chartered** and what was not. But I also realized that that that group of people was they were shell shocked because I mean a little bit of the history **Standard Chartered** was just three years earlier they were the darling of the city trading at a multiple of their book value and had subsequently dropped down to something around book value that subsequently fell down to 30% of book value. But that in 2012 they were heroes and and told that they were great and very big investors came in and put a lot of money with the at a very high price saying you guys are great and you're...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 包括我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Including us.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我不这么认为。我觉得你们当时精明得多。但当时并没有过多的参与。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I don't think so. I think you were much much much more astute at the time. But no notice was was was involved, but I don't think outsized at the time.

</details>

### 与股东和监管机构的沟通

**Nicolola Tangan**: 当你进入银行时，银行陷入困境，就像一颗陨落的明星，而你是一个新人，你如何与股东沟通？关键点和关键信息是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: When you come in there and the bank is in trouble and you're like a fallen star and you're a new person, what how do you communicate with shareholders? What's the what are the key what are the key things and key messages?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 最重要、最首要的沟通对象是**监管机构**，因为银行已经失去了监管机构的信任，对吗？所以，我最初的互动就是非常明确地表示，监管机构实际上是我们的第一优先事项，甚至可以牺牲股东的利益，这不是因为这种情况可以持续很长时间，而是因为在当时，这是银行生存的必要条件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: You know the very first and most important communicators were with regulators because the bank had lost the confidence of of regulators, right? And so my my first interactions were just to to be be very clear that that the regulators actually were the very single number one priority even at the expense of shareholders not because that can sustain for any period of time but because that was necessary for existence at that point.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 愚蠢的问题。为什么与监管机构保持良好关系很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Stupid question. Why is it important to be friends with the regulators?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 因为监管机构给你经营许可证，没有监管机构的支持，你就无法经营。你知道，2012年**渣打银行**首次被认定违反**美国**的一些金融犯罪规则时，曾有人质疑**美国**是否会吊销我们的银行牌照。我不知道当时情况有多危急，但肯定被考虑过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Because regulators give you a license to operate and without the support of the of the regulator you can't operate. You know there there were there were questions back in 2012 when **Standard Chartered** was first identified as having violated some of the financial crime rules in in the **US**. There was a question whether the **US** would would remove our banking license. I don't know how close that ever came but it was certainly considered and...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 没有银行牌照的银行，那可不是一个好地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And a bank without a banking license that's not a good place to be.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 它就不存在了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: It doesn't exist.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 它就不存在了。不一定在每个国家都这样，但如果那个国家是**美国**，而你是最大的美元清算银行之一，这意味着你不能再清算美元，那它是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: It doesn't exist. Not necessarily in every country, but if that country is the **United States** and you're one of the largest clearers of **US** dollars and that means you can no longer clear **US** dollars, it's it's as essential. So...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 但是，当你与股东沟通时，你告诉他们什么？你的梦想、计划还是具体目标？你是如何做的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: But but how do you communicate with shareholders when just what do you what do you tell them? Do you tell them your dreams or your plans or your specific targets? Just how do you...

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我首先向股东解释了我接受这份工作的原因。我想，对我交谈过的任何人来说，都很清楚我并非必须接受这份工作。我不是一个被内部提拔来继续工作的人。我放弃了外面非常舒适的生活，去尝试一些新的事情。我解释了原因，我解释说我认为基础业务是一个超级业务，我们有一些问题，但我们可以解决它们。我曾在**摩根大通**工作，当时**摩根大通**将自己出售给了**大通银行**。那家银行，**摩根大通大通银行**，考虑到它今天的强大，很难想象，它在2001年经历了非常艰难的时期，原因是**安然**和**世通**破产以及**互联网泡沫**破裂期间的其他相关失败。我们作为一个团队齐心协力修复了那家银行。我想**杰米·戴蒙**四年后才加入，然后继续修复银行，并显然将其发展到今天的规模。所以，我有一些处理非常糟糕的情况以及与监管机构关系非常糟糕的经验，这些经验最终对股东非常有利，我试图利用这段历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I started by I so I gave shareholders my assessment of why I took the job. And it it was pretty clear I think to anybody I was speaking to that I didn't have to take that job. I wasn't an internal person that was that was brought into to carry on. I was I dropped a really nice comfortable life outside to go do something new. And I explained why and I explained that I thought that the underlying franchise was a super franchise that we had some problems that we could fix them. I had been at **JP Morgan** at the time that **JP Morgan** sold itself to **Chase**. That bank **JP Morgan Chase**, which is hard to imagine today given how powerful that bank is. That bank had had a really difficult time in 2001 on the back of the the bankruptcy of **Enron** and **WorldCom** and and other associated failures during that the dotcom bust and and other things. And we as a team pulled together and fixed that bank. Jamie then came in four years later I guess and and then continue to fix the bank and obviously has taken it on to to what it is today. So I had some experience with really bad situations with really bad relationships with regulators that had worked out really well for shareholders and I tried to play on that history.

### 市场与内部认知的差异

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你是什么时候开始觉得一切都好起来了，我们已经解决了问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: When did you first start to think that everything hey now things are going well we sorted it?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 有趣的是，我认为情况好转的时间与市场认为情况好转的时间略有不同。所以，我们在2015年和2016年采取了非常严厉的措施，包括管理和财务方面。我认为2017年和2018年绝对是重建之年。我们当时也有很大的**技术赤字**，需要弥补技术差距和淘汰过时的技术。2019年我对情况感觉非常好，我们一开始就设定了三年业绩目标，就像我们所有人都会做的那样，业绩计划也与此挂钩，所以一切都是公开的。2019年本应是重要的交付之年，但由于利率低于预期，我们略微未能达到目标。但我们仍在正轨上，所以2020年本应是交付之年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Well, but you know, interesting when I thought things were going well was a little bit different than when the market thought things were going well. So we we took you know really severe medicine in 2015 and 16 both management and and and sure you financial. I think 17 and 18 were definitely rebuilding years. We also had a big technical deficit so technology gaps obsolescence that needed to be closed. I was feeling very good about things in 2019 and we had set at the outset three-year performance targets as as as we all do and you know performance plans were linked to that so it was all public. And the big delivery year was going to be 2019 as it happens we fell a little bit short of the targets in 2019 largely because interest rates had had fallen relative to what we expected but we were on track and so so 2020 was going to be the delivery year.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 那在当时根本没有反映在市场上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: That was not reflected in the market at all for us at that point.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 没有足够长的时间让我感到沮丧。我们都知道2020年发生了什么，**新冠疫情**和利率降至零，这对任何银行来说都非常糟糕。对我们银行来说，当时尤其糟糕。所以，我们不得不“原地踏步”两年，虽然持续取得进展，但并不明显。所以，2019年我感觉情况良好，但我认为市场直到2022年或2023年才最终接受这种观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Not long enough to be too frustrated. We know what we know what happened in 2020 with with **COVID** and interest rates going to zero, which is very bad for any bank. It's it was particularly bad for our bank at that point. So for two years we had to kind of tread water with continued to progress but but it was not very visible. So I felt things were in in good in good nick in 2019, but I don't think the market finally came around to that view until probably 2022 or 23.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 为什么花了这么长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What took it so long?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: **新冠疫情**持续了两年。我们存在**信誉差距**，我认为这个信誉差距源于2014年、2015年和2016年的问题。我们相对较小，所以不是每个投资者都必须花大量时间了解像**渣打银行**这样相对复杂的银行。所以，我认为一位非常明智的股东，实际上是一位非股东但非常大的资产管理公司的投资组合经理，他说：“你知道，这种情况会是这样的：你必须连续两三年表现出色，然后人们才会真正关注，然后就会蜂拥而至。”他可能在2018年对我说了这句话。当时我觉得有点夸张。事实证明，我认为他是完全正确的。如果是一家更大的银行，比如比我们大得多的**汇丰银行**，情况可能就不一样了。它们有类似的业务模式，但它们都在指数中，在所有指数中。你不能不持有**汇丰银行**，或者如果你不持有**汇丰银行**，你必须非常清楚你不能持有它。而**渣打银行**不会从根本上改变你的投资组合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: **COVID** was two years. We had a **credibility gap**, which I think was the credibility gap that came from the problems in 2014, 15, 16. We're relatively small, so that not every investor has to spend a lot of time understanding a relatively complex bank like **Standard Chartered**. And so I think there there's a very wise shareholder, well actually non-shareholder but a portfolio manager, a very large asset manager who said, you know, the way this is going to work is you're going to have to outperform for two or three years before anybody really pays attention and then people will crowd in. And I thought, and he probably said that to me in 2018. I thought that was a a little bit histrionic at the time. It turns out I think he was he was exactly correct, which, you know, I don't think it would necessarily be the same if it was a much bigger bank, even a bank like **HSBC** much bigger than us. Similar kind of business profile, but they're in the indices, they're in all the indices. You can't not own **HSBC** or if you don't own **HSBC** you have to be very aware that you don't you cannot own it **Standard Chartered** and it's not going to fundamentally change your your portfolio.

### 银行重塑的经验教训

**Nicolola Tangan**: 如果你再次接管一家处于同样境地的银行，你会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: If you were to take over a bank in the same situation again what would you do differently?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我犯的最大错误，而且是一个大错误，就是没有意识到在我到来之前，银行内部的**风险偏好**已经崩溃了。所以我在第一天上班时，看到了许多迹象表明在合规、行为以及财务方面存在**控制松懈**，比如**信贷损失**。我猛踩刹车。我做得过火了。我之所以做得过火，是因为我在调查之前就采取了行动。所以，那些指标非常负面。因此我说，你们失控了。基本上，在一段时间内，没有我的批准，你们什么都不能做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: But the biggest mistake I made, and it was a big one, was to not realize that the **risk appetite** inside the bank had already collapsed before I arrived. So I showed up on day one. I saw many indicators of of loose controls on the compliance side, on the conduct side, and then on the financial side. So, credit losses. And I hit the brakes hard. And that was I overdid it. And I overdid it because I acted before I before I investigated. So, the indicators were very negative. And, so I said, you know, this is you're out of control. Basically, you can't do anything without my approval for a little while. And...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 但他们已经吓坏了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And they were already scared to death.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 但他们已经吓坏了。他们已经吓坏了六个月了。所以，你知道，在我上任的第一年，**资产负债表**缩减了近三分之一。其中可能有一半是不必要的。我可能对自己有点苛刻，但我想我过度强调了风险信息，甚至比我短期内造成的损害更糟糕的是，这意味着要摆脱那种**规避风险**的立场变得更加困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: But they were already scared to death. And and they had been scared to death for six months. So you know the **balance sheet** shrunk by the better part of a third in my first year. Probably half of that was unnecessary. I I may be a little bit harsh on myself on that one, but but I I I think I I over I overindulged on the the risk messaging and and maybe even more harmful than the damage that I did in the short term was that it meant it was that much harder to get out of that that risk averse position.

### 摩根大通的经验

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你从在**摩根大通**的经历中，学到了哪些最重要的东西并带到了这家银行？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What were the most important things that you took from your time at **JP Morgan** to bring into this bank?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 在我工作期间，**摩根大通**曾是几家不同的银行。我于1983年开始在那里工作。它是一家**美国**商业银行，但非常杰出，但仍然是一家商业银行。然后**摩根士丹利**和**高盛**是其他我们只听说过的机构。在我到任后不久，**摩根大通**的传奇领导人**卢·普雷斯顿**（后来担任**世界银行**行长）说：“我们必须做出决定。我们是跟随客户进入他们正在追求的产品，还是跟随我们的产品进入新的客户群体？”这是因为我们的客户正在进入**资本市场**，而我们作为一家**美国**商业银行，由于**格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案**的限制，无法进入。**普雷斯顿**预言性地说，我们将跟随我们的客户，因此我们需要一套新的产品。所以我们开发了一些传统的投资银行产品，比如**债务和股权资本市场**，首先是债务，然后是股权。但我们也允许自己进入一些新领域，比如**衍生品市场**的早期阶段。所以我的第一个重要教训是，你要问自己一个问题：你为什么在这里？你是为了服务客户，还是为了推销产品？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: You know, **JP Morgan** was was several different banks in my time there. I started there in 1983. It was a **US** commercial bank, but a very preeminent **US** commercial bank, but a commercial bank. And then **Morgan Stanley** and **Goldman Sachs** were these other things that we just heard about. Shortly after I arrived, **Lou Preston**, legendary leader of **JP Morgan**, who went on to run the **World Bank**, said, you know, we've got to make a decision. Do we follow our clients into the products that they're pursuing or do we follow our products into a new group of clients? And that was because our clients were going into **capital markets**, which we as a **US** commercial bank were unable to access because of the **Glass-Steagall Act**. And **Preston** said prophetically, we will follow our clients and therefore we need a new set of products. So we developed some conventional investment banking products like **debt and equity capital markets**, first debt, then equity. But then also gave ourselves license to get into some new areas like the very early days of the **derivative markets**. So my the first big lesson was you ask yourself the question, why are you there? Are you there to serve your clients or are you there to push products?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 答案，正确的答案几乎总是服务客户，但有时可能不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: The answer the right answer is almost always serve your clients but but perhaps in some cases it's not.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 第二个对我来说是巨大的教训，我只是非常幸运地被分配到这个**衍生品**领域，或者我们1987年称之为**掉期**的领域，当时它刚刚起步。我在接下来的25年里乘风破浪，这给了我一个机会，在最初的幕后，在那个没有人太关注的“暗室”里，进行创新和创造，然后将从创新过程中产生的东西工业化。那是我一生中最棒的学习经历。我只是，你知道，事情就是这样发生的，各种事物和事件的汇合让我在那时抓住了机会，并乘风破浪。但我们在**摩根大通**做了一些非常有趣的事情，你知道，也许我们后来把公司卖给了**大通银行**，那次清理工作绝对令人着迷。你知道，我可以责怪我们在出售公司时没有做好尽职调查，因为我们以巨大的溢价将公司卖给了一家股票被严重高估的公司。没关系。就像你今天看到的**摩根大通大通银行**一样，它成功了。但那是一条非常坎坷的道路，但那次清理过程令人着迷。然后**杰米·戴蒙**来了，你知道，我从**杰米**那里学到的东西，和我工作生涯中从任何人那里学到的都一样多。他是一位纪律严明、非常专注的管理者。我们当然并非总是相处融洽。我与**杰米**在**摩根大通**的关系并没有善终，但它一直保持得很好。我的意思是，我把他归为好朋友一类，直到今天，尽管我们一路坎坷。他是一位出色的管理者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Second was, and this the huge lesson for me was I just got very lucky and got got put into this **derivative** area or **swaps** as we called it in 1987 when it was just getting started and I rode that wave for the next 25 years as a and it it gave me an opportunity in in the outset in sort of the back room in the in the dark the dark room that nobody paid too much attention to to innovate and create and then later to industrialize something that started from an innovative process. The most fabulous learning experience of my life. I was just I was just you know how things happen just a confluence of of things and events that allowed me to glom onto that at that point and and just ride that wave. But we did some we did some really interesting things at **JP Morgan** and you know maybe the we then sold the company to **Chase** that cleanup was absolutely fascinating. You know I I can blame us for having done very bad due diligence at the time that we sold the company because we sold the company at a huge premium to a company whose stock was hugely overvalued as it turned out. It's okay. Like as as you see today with **JP Morgan Chase**, it worked out. But there it was a very bumpy road, but that cleanup process was fascinating. And then **Jamie** came and you know, I learned as much from **Jamie** as I've learned from anybody in my working life. He's just a highly disciplined, very focused manager. And we didn't always get along for sure. And and it didn't end well my relationship with **Jamie** at **JP Morgan**, but it's end it's carried on very well. I mean, I would put I put him in the category of good friends to this day despite the bumps we had along the road. He's a fabulous manager.

### 领导风格

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你会如何定义你的领导风格？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How would you define your leadership style?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我会把我的领导风格定义为**高度协作**。我不是特别指令性的。我的意思是，如果需要，我可以深入细节，但我更喜欢不这样做。我更喜欢为我工作的人自己处理细节。我尝试在每一个机会下放责任。我尝试创建一个团队，这个团队是一个整体，而不是一系列与我保持双边关系的团队。有些人可能会说我过度重视**选择权**，以至于我承担了过多的选择，付出了过高的持有成本。另一些人可能会说，你愿意支持不确定的事情，正是这些年来改变了你所服务的组织，使其变得更好。我承认我可能过度重视选择权。但我认为这在总体上是一件好事。但这可能是我领导风格中最具争议的一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I would define my leadership style as as very collaborative. I'm not particularly directive. I mean, I can get deeply into the details if I need to, but I would prefer not to. I'd prefer that the people that are that are working for me are really taking care of the details themselves. I try to push accountability down at every opportunity. I try to create a team that is a team rather than a team that has a series of bilateral relationships with me. I probably some would say that I overindex **optionality** so that that that I'm I that I carry too many options at too high a carry cost. Some would say that others would say the fact that you're prepared to back non-sure things is what has changed the organizations for the better that you work for over the years. I would accept that I I probably overindex optionality. I unbiased on balance. I think that's a good thing. But that that's probably the most controversial of the things that are attributed to my leadership style.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 有些人说我有时就是做不了决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Some people say I just can't make a decision sometimes.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 你会怎么说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And what would you say?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我会说我喜欢**选择权**，我会在合适的时机做出决定，无论是行使、出售还是关闭该选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I say I love optionality and I'll make a decision when it's the right right time to either exercise, sell or shut down that option.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 是的。选择权通常被低估，有时价值很高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Yeah. Optionality is often underpriced and worth a lot sometimes.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 有时是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Sometimes.

</details>

### 对当前世界的看法

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你如何看待今天的世界？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How do you read today's world?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 显然，今天世界局势非常紧张。你知道，我每天早上醒来都在想**中国**或**亚洲**昨晚发生了什么，或者取决于我在哪里。我每天晚上睡觉时都在想我睡着后会发生什么。你知道，我们发现从黎明到黄昏，事情进展得相当顺利。所以，我碰巧在4月2日去了**越南**，我在4月1日晚上会见了总理，然后，或者实际上是2日晚上，然后醒来发现**越南**在关税图表上是46%。我们都记得关税图表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: It's it's obviously super tense today and you know I wake up each morning wondering what happened overnight in **China** or or or in **Asia** or depending on where I'm sitting and I go to bed each night wondering what's going to happen when I sleep. And you know what we find in the between dawn and dusk is things are going pretty well. So I happened to be in **Vietnam** on April 2nd and I had met with the prime minister on the evening of the first and then or at the evening of second actually and then woke up to find this you the **Vietnam** was at 46% on the on the tariff chart. We we were all remember the tariff chart.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 所以这是一个解放日，他们引入了...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And so this was a liberation day where they introduced...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 那是关税引入的日子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: That was the day the tariffs were introduced.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我在前一天晚上对总理说，我不知道今天这场新闻发布会会带来什么，但我想你不必担心，因为归根结底，我认为**美国总统**并不真正热衷于摧毁他的经济。然后46%的数字出来了。第二天早上我会见了总理和财政部长，他说你昨晚给了我什么建议？因为我们今天很担心。我说，我比昨天更担心一点，因为整件事非常戏剧化。但我仍然认为你不必担心，因为我真的不认为**美国**想通过**通货膨胀**或**经济活动受抑制**来摧毁自己的经济。所以，我的建议是，你们要找出那些对**美国**真正敏感的事情。对你们**越南**来说，最明显的就是**转运**。你们是一个非常大的转运点，或者至少据称是**中国**商品在通过时被盖上“**越南制造**”的印章。我想你们在这方面赚不到多少钱。我想它也不是你们人民的大雇主。这只是你们做的一件事。我想你们可以专注于此，并与**美国**达成一个相当不错的协议。无论如何，我们认为全球关税最终将达到10%，**中国**将达到25%，我仍然坚持这个观点。我从未改变过这个观点。我仍然认为，一旦我们考虑到所有豁免和新的协议，比如**印度**必须达成协议等等，我们就会达到这个水平。所以，如果你认为**美国**不想自伤，**中国**也不想自伤，但他们正处于激烈的竞争中，这种竞争将持续我的一生，甚至更久，那么你就必须在这种紧张局势中前行。你知道，我更广泛地反思的是，在世界历史上，我们从未像现在这样，重大冲突如此之少。所以，当然，如果你在**加沙**、**黎巴嫩南部**或**乌克兰**，你就不会有这种感觉。但从广义上讲，现在是世界一个非常和平的时期。我希望我们能维持下去。我希望这根本上是**美国**、**中国**，甚至是**俄罗斯**、**欧洲**这些世界主要军事强国的**自身利益**在持续发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And I had said to the prime minister the night before, I don't know what's going to come today in this press conference, but I don't think you need to worry because at the end of the day, I don't think the **president of the United States** is really keen to trash his economy. And then the 46% number came out and and I met with him in the finance minister the next morning and he said what kind of advice was that you gave me last night because we're worried here today I said I'm Well, I'm a little bit more worried than I was yesterday because it was quite dramatic this whole thing. But but I still don't think you need to worry because I really don't think that the **United States** wants to destroy its own economy through **inflation** or or through suppressed economic activity. So what what I would suggest is that you identify those things that are really sensitive to the **US**. The obvious one for you in **Vietnam** is is **trans shipments**. You're a very large trans shipment point or at least allegedly for Chinese goods that are that are basically stamped **made in Vietnam** on the way through. I don't think you make a lot of money at that. I don't think it's a big employer of your people. It's just a thing that you do. I think you could probably focus on that and and and cut a pretty good deal with the **US** on the way back. Anyway, we we had the view that tariffs would end up at 10% for the world, 25% for **China**, and I will still maintain that that I never change that view. I would still maintain that's where we're going to be once we've factored in all the exemptions and the new you know **India** has to cut the deal etc. So if but if you take the view that the **US** doesn't want to to engage in self harm and **China** doesn't want to engage in self harm but they're in an intense competition that's going to persist for my entire lifetime and and beyond I suspect then you just have to ride with with that tension. And you know what I reflect on more broadly is that in the history of the world we've never been at a time where there was less major conflict than right now. So, of course, you don't feel that way if you're in **Gaza** or southern **Lebanon** or **Ukraine**. But broadly, this is a really peaceful time in the world. And I'm hopeful that we can sustain that. And I'm I'm hopeful that it's fundamentally it's the **self-interest** of the **United States**, **China**, even **Russia**, **Europe** as as the major military powers in the world that that continue. So...

### 全球化重置

**Nicolola Tangan**: 当你谈到**全球化重置**时，你指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: When you when you talk about resetting globalization, what do you mean by that?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们指的是在享受**全球化**利益的同时，不让像上次那样，让部分关键人口掉队。我们都知道，全球化为世界各地数十亿人带来了巨大的财富和繁荣。我们也知道，在民主国家中，有非常重要的选民群体被抛在了后面，因为他们的市场去工业化或部分去工业化，因此我们看到了**民粹主义**的反弹。所以，重置全球化，这只是被剥夺权利的人的一个例子。我认为还有**人权**或**原住民**受虐待的事件，这些都伴随着全球化而来。全球化也缺乏对**可持续性**和**温室气体排放管理**的关注。所以，重置全球化就是，在获取我们一直从全球化中认识到的尽可能多的利益的同时，可能时不时地放慢一点脚步，以带动其他人群共同发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: We mean extracting the benefits of **globalization** without leaving key parts of the population behind as we did last time. So we all know that **globalization** was a tremendous enricher and generator of prosperity for billions of people around the world. We also know that there were extremely important chunks of the electorate in democracies that were left behind as their markets de-industrialized or partially de-industrialized and hence we get the the the **populist backlash**. So resetting globalization and that's just one example of of people that were disenfranchised. I think there were also incidents of **human rights** or **indigenous people abuses** that came with globalization. There was a lack of focus on on **sustainability** and and and managing **greenhouse gas emissions** that came with globalization. So resetting globalization is is getting as much of of the benefit that we have always recognized from globalization while taking maybe a slightly slower step from time to time to to bring those other populations along.

### 金融体系的分离趋势

**Nicolola Tangan**: 我们是否正在走向一个拥有独立金融系统的世界？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Are we moving towards a world with separate financial systems?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我担心我们正在走向这个方向，尽管我认为世界上很大一部分地区将同时在这两个系统下运作。所以目前，**美元**就是美元，**布雷顿森林体系**仍然占据主导地位。**中国**正在稳步建立一个替代**美元**的金融基础设施。我不认为他们的目标是取代美元，当然不是作为储备货币，我甚至不认为作为贸易货币，但他们确实希望拥有一个设施，以便在他们无法获得美元时能够继续进行贸易。所以，无论是哪个系统，我们都非常积极地参与其中，今天它们是完全可互操作的，但当然我们可以想象一个它们分离的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I fear that we are, although I think there will be a big chunk of the world that operates in both. So at the for the time being the **dollar** is the dollar and the **Bretton Woods system** is still preeminent. **China** is is steadily building up a a financial infrastructure that is an alternative to the **US dollar**. I don't think their objective is to displace the dollar certainly not as a reserve currency but I don't even think as a as a currency of trade but they do want to have a facility to continue trading if their access to dollars is shut down. And so whether it's the and and we play very actively in both call it financial systems they're completely interoperable today but of course we could imagine a time when they're disintegrated.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 就像**俄罗斯**在入侵**乌克兰**后被从全球金融体系中分离出来一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: As **Russia** was disintegrated from from the global financial system after they invaded **Ukraine**.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 所以，我担心我们正在一点点地走向那个方向，我担心我们在技术和底层技术基础设施方面也走向同一个方向。但我们也看到，世界上一些非常重要的国家，从**印度**、**巴西**、**南非**、**中东**开始，不会选择站队，我认为它们也无法被迫选择站队。所以它们将在两个金融体系中运作，只要中间有人，那么这两个系统之间就有了桥梁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: So so I fear we're heading that direction bit by bit and I fear we're heading the same direction in technology and and underlying technical infrastructure. But we've also seen that that very important countries in the world starting with with **India**, **Brazil**, **South Africa**, the **Middle East** aren't going to choose sides and I don't think they can be compelled to choose sides. So they'll be operating in both financial systems and as as soon as as long as you have somebody in the middle then you've got the bridge between the two.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 即使它们在技术上不具备互操作性，这也将使它们互操作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Which will render them interoperable even if they're technically not interoperable.

</details>

### 区域展望：中国

**Nicolola Tangan**: 那么，我们花一分钟时间谈谈你们运营的主要区域。让我们从**中国**开始。你如何看待**中国**的长期前景？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: So let's spend a minute on the big regions where you operate. And let's start with **China**. How do you see the longer term outlook for **China**?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 长期来看，我对**中国**非常乐观。我认为他们显然拥有巨大的技术优势。现在，我们知道他们在一些尖端技术方面正在迎头赶上，但我们也看到了他们追赶的速度有多快，即使在芯片设计等领域，两年前的差距还非常大。所以，我认为从技术上讲，**中国**处于一个有利位置。**中国**目前正在经历一个重大转型。我在**西蒙弗雷泽大学**（SFU）经历过经济发展中的重大转型，它们通常非常丑陋。它们通常与**房地产危机**或**泡沫破裂**等事件相关联，这通常又与**股市崩盘**、**衰退**或在某些情况下是**萧条**相关联。当这些事情发生在**美国**、**英国**、**挪威**或其他任何地方时，它们都具有极大的破坏性。我认为**中国**非常渴望避免在他们的情况下，**房地产泡沫**破裂（其中也有一点**股市泡沫**，但主要是房地产泡沫）的负面后果。到目前为止，情况还不错，因为他们没有在房地产危机之后出现金融危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Longer term, I'm very optimistic about **China**. I think they've clearly have some some huge technical and technology advantages. Now, they're coming from behind in some of the cutting edge technologies we know, but we've also seen how quickly they can catch up even in things like chip design where the where the gap was enormous even two years ago. So, I think technically technologically, **China**'s in a good place. **China**'s going through a major transition right now. And I I've at **SFU** lived through major transitions in in economies as they develop and they're quite ugly. They're usually associated with things like **real estate crises** or or **bubbles bursting** which is often associated with **stock market crashes**, **recessions** or **depressions** in some case. And these are extremely destabilizing things when they happen in the **United States** or the **United Kingdom** or **Norway** or anywhere else. **China**, I think, is desperately keen to avoid the the adverse consequences of the deflation of, in their case, a **property bubble**, which was also a little bit of an **equity market bubble**, but really it was a **property bubble**. And so far so good in the sense that they've not had a financial crisis following from the the property crisis.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我说目前还不错，是因为它还没有结束。房地产市场尚未开始复苏。金融系统完好无损，但它完全削弱了消费者信心和投资者信心。在**中国**，重新点燃消费者信心很困难。所以，我们今天看到的4.8%左右的增长率，低于**中国**的潜力。它仍然只是一个中等收入国家。4.8%并不是一个如此规模国家合适的长期增长率。他们面临着真正的挑战。随着房地产市场稳定下来，股市也开始稳定，我想他们可以期待，我想他们会注入一些今天缺乏的刺激措施，特别是针对消费经济，并获得一些提振，但这可能还需要三四年。与此同时，技术基础看起来相当不错。另一个明显的挑战是他们拥有**出口导向型经济**，他们在出口方面非常强大，以至于他们正在被主要市场拒之门外，几乎完全被**美国**的非必需品市场拒之门外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: The I say so far so good because it's not over. The property market hasn't yet begun to recover. The financial system is intact, but it's it's completely sapped consumer confidence and investor confidence. It's tough to reignite the consumer confidence in **China**. So as we sit here today at 4.8 or so percent growth, which is below potential for **China**. It's still a just a middle-income country. 4.8% is is not the the appropriate long-term growth rate for a country of that size. They've got they've got a real challenge. And as the property market stabilizes, the equity market has begun to stabilize, I think they can expect I think then they'll they'll inject some some of the stimulus that's lacking today in particular into the consumer economy and and get a little bit of lift, but that could be another three or four years. In the meantime, the the technical base looks quite good. And the other obvious challenge is they've got an **export-led economy** and they're they're so strong on the export side that that they're being shut out of key markets almost entirely shut out...

### 区域展望：印度与中东

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你如何看待**印度**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How do you read **India**?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: **印度**是一个强国。我认为**莫迪总理**十年前启动并正在推行的改革非常有效。它仍然是一个贫穷的国家，所以还有很多路要走。最近一个季度8%的**GDP增长**数字非常令人鼓舞，这更接近我们认为的其真正潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: **India** is is a powerhouse and I think the reforms that that **Prime Minister Modi** initiated 10 years ago and has is carrying on have been extremely effective. It's still a poor country so there's you know there's there's a ton more to go 8% **GDP growth** figure in the most recent quarter is very encouraging getting closer to what we would think is its real potential.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 还有更多的结构性改革要做，还有更多的基础设施需要建设。我认为还需要进行持续的文化调整，以使外国投资者更容易在该国运营，但车轮已经启动。我认为**印度**将持续一段时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: The um there's still much more structural real form to do there's much more infrastructure that needs to be built and I think there's ongoing cultural adjustments that will be necessary to make it easier for foreign investors to operate in the country but but the wheels are in motion I think **India** will carry on for some time.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: **中东**对你来说是很大的希望吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Middle East major hope for you?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: **中东**一直在蓬勃发展，这显然得益于油价，但这已经不是主要的推动力了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: **Middle East** is is is has been booming on the back of of obviously oil prices helped but that's less of a of a tail.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 很多英国人正在搬到那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And a little and a lot of English people are moving there.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: **迪拜**尤其如此，它确实正在崛起。实际上，流入**迪拜**的大部分财富是**印度**或**南亚**的。它始于**新冠疫情**期间，因为事实证明那里是一个非常好的避难所。**阿联酋**非常欢迎有钱人。但那是，是的，资产管理行业的一部分正在搬迁，随之而来的是一些来自**英国**的避税者，我很抱歉这么说。但我想这个地区，我的意思是，**中东**最有趣的地方在于它正在从一个石油和债权经济体转变为一个发展中的**多元化经济体**。它实际上是资本消耗巨大的。有趣的是，在**利雅得**举行的年度盛会上，人们过去常常以为可以带着钱离开去开展业务，而现在去的人都是带着钱去投资那里令人兴奋的项目，这在短短五年内发生了巨大的变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Well, the **Dubai** in particular is is is is certainly picking up actually the bulk of the wealth that's moving into **Dubai** is Indian or South Asian. It started during **COVID** because it turned out it was a really nice place to to seek refuge and they they've been very welcoming to people with money in in the **UAE**. But that's yeah chunks of the asset management industry are moving and and with that a few a few tax tax exiles from **Britain** I'm sorry to say but you know I think the region is I mean the most interesting thing about the **Middle East** is that it's transforming from being an an oil and creditor economy to being a developing diversified economy. It's actually hugely capital consumptive and it's interesting to see at the at the the annual jamboree that they have in **Riyadh** that you know people used to go thinking they could walk away with money for their business and now they the people who go are people who are coming with money in their pocket to invest in the exciting projects there and it's a big change in just 5 years.

</details>

### 数字资产与银行业未来

**Nicolola Tangan**: 谈到钱，你一直是**数字资产**领域的行业领导者。这将在银行业的未来扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Talking about money you've been an industry leader in digital assets what role will this play in the future of banking?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为它将绝对是核心。我们的观点是，几年前这可能颇具争议，但今天已不那么争议了。我们的基本观点是，最终所有事物都将基于**区块链**进行结算。所有事物当然包括**证券**，但也包括**货币**，即**支付**，然后最终将包括**房地产**、**艺术品**、**葡萄酒**等现实世界资产，或者人们可能想投资的任何其他东西。你知道，我们为什么这么认为？因为基于**区块链**的结算更便宜、更容易、更透明、更可追溯，而且是实时的。所以当你拥有所有这些优势时，很难想象它最终不会胜出。现在，障碍曾经是技术性的。现在已经没有技术障碍了。我们已经试点了一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I I think it will be absolutely central. I our view is well it's probably quite controversial a few years ago less so today but and we have a a an underlying view which is that eventually all things will settle on **blockchains** and all things certainly means **securities** but also means **money** so **payments** and and then eventually will mean real world assets like **property** and **art** and **wine** or whatever else people might want to invest in. And you know why do I why do we think that? Because **blockchain** based settlement is cheaper. It's easier. It's more transparent. It's more traceable and it's real time. So when you've got all those advantages, it's hard to see why that wouldn't ultimately prevail. Now the the obstacle the obstacles have been technical. There's the there are no longer technical obstacles. We've piloted everything.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 真正的障碍是**监管**。监管机构对全新的金融基础设施感到担忧是可以理解的。他们为什么对此特别担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: The real obstacles are **regulation**. Regulators are understandably quite nervous about a whole new financial infrastructure. And why are they particularly nervous about this?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为他们担忧的原因不同。第一，**区块链技术**唯一大规模部署的地方是**加密货币**。**加密货币**与真实货币无关，除了你可以将它们相互转换。但**加密货币**成为了犯罪分子的领域，非常适合**洗钱**或处置非法所得。所以，这已经让执法部门和监管机构感到担忧。第二，当你考虑将**区块链技术**应用于支付时，即使用非加密货币的**数字资产**作为支付的交换媒介。它是一种非常自然的支付交换媒介。这意味着存款不再存放在银行，而是存放在**稳定币**中。如今，主要的稳定币投资于政府债券。作为银行监管机构，**英格兰银行**行长兼**金融稳定理事会**主席**安德鲁·贝利**（Andrew Bailey）以及许多银行监管机构都非常明确地表示，一个将存款从银行系统抽走，基本上用于资助政府赤字的系统是不稳定的。现在，这并不意味着它不会发生。或者这并不意味着坏事不会发生。但我认为基于稳定币的支付系统（包括**代币化银行存款**，即你将钱留在银行系统，或**央行数字货币**，即央行获得资金，但他们总是说我们会保持规模很小，以免从银行系统抽走太多存款）的优势是不可避免的。因此，我们已经在该领域投资了七年，并拥有这些机制的领先机构级平台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: So I think they're nervous for different reasons. Number one, the **blockchain technology**, the only place it's been deployed at scale is **cryptocurrencies** and **cryptocurrencies** which have nothing to do with with with real money other than the fact that you can convert them from one to the other. But **cryptocurrencies** became a domain for the criminal and and it was wonderful for **money laundering** or for disposal of of illicit gains or whatever. And so that already makes I think law enforcement and and regulators nervous. But second is as you think about moving that that **blockchain technology** moving into **payments**. So using things that aren't **cryptocurrencies** but are **digital assets** as for your question as a medium of exchange for **payments**. And it's quite a natural medium of exchange for payments. It means that that the the deposits are no longer sitting in banks. The deposits are sitting in in **stablecoins** which today the big **stablecoins** are invested in government bonds and as a bank regulator and **Andrew Bailey** head of the **Bank of England** and but also chairman of the **FSB** has been very clear and not him not just him many of the bank regulators have been very clear that a system that that drains deposits out of the banking system basically to fund government deficits is an unstable system. Now it doesn't mean it won't happen. And or it doesn't mean that that that bad things can happen anyway, but I think the the benefits of of a payment system that's based on **stablecoins**, which would include also **tokenized bank deposits**, i.e. you keep the money in the banking system or **central bank digital currencies**, which the central bank gets the money, but they've always said we'll keep it we'll keep it quite small so as not to drain too much by way of deposits from the banking system. But the benefits of a **stablecoin** based payment platform are inexorable in in our opinion and therefore we've been investing in in that area for seven years and have the leading institutional grade platforms for those mechanisms.

### AI对银行的影响

**Nicolola Tangan**: 谈到变化，**人工智能**将如何改变你的银行？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Talking about changes, **AI**, how will that change your bank?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为**人工智能**将是一个巨大的**游戏规则改变者**。是的，我想我们都在使用大型...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: It's a I think **AI** is going to be a huge game changer. Yeah, we I think we've all been using large...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 已经改变了吗？还是只是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Is it already or is it just it is in...

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 在某些领域是的。例如在**欺诈检测**、**反洗钱**、**合规**等领域。所以，我们一直在处理大数据以寻找模式或事件。它已经极大地提高了我们打击金融犯罪的能力。你知道，我们仍然只捕获了我们认为世界上3%的金融犯罪。所以我们几乎没有击垮犯罪分子，但这是一个巨大的进步。我认为，几乎所有构建大型系统的人都在使用**人工智能**进行**代码生成**，也就是编程。这已经是生产力了。我认为生产力投资将是意义重大的，并将使公司以提高盈利能力的方式增长。大的变化将来自**产品开发**和**客户服务**，当我们大规模部署代理来改善客户成果和建议时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Some areas. So in in areas like you know **fraud detection**, **anti-money laundering**, **compliance**. So so where where we've always been trolling big data for for patterns or or incidents. It has already you know drastically improved our ability to fight financial crime. You know PS we still only capture 3% of the financial crime that we think is committed in the world. So it's like we've hardly broken the back of the criminal, but but it's but it's a huge improvement. I think I think pretty much anybody that builds large scale systems is using **AI** for **code generation**. So programming that's already that's but that's productivity. I think the productivity investments will be meaningful and will allow companies to grow with improved profitability. The the big changes will come with with **product development** with **customer service** when when we were deploying agents in scale to improve the the customer outcomes and advice.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为我们正处于这些应用的早期阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And that I think we're very early stage in those applications.

</details>

### 企业文化与变革

**Nicolola Tangan**: 让我们谈谈企业文化。你谈到了一些你的领导风格，但你如何描述银行的企业文化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Let's move on to corporate culture. You talked about a bit about your your leadership style but how do you how would you describe the corporate culture in the bank?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为我们的文化是**高度协作**的，我会说这是最大的积极因素，并且基于多元化的投入。所以我们作为一家公司在结构上是多元化的，我的意思是我们在55个市场有实体运营，另外120个市场通过飞行和联系进行。我们有来自所有这些国家的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I think our culture is highly collaborative and I say that would be the big positive and based on on diverse inputs. So we're structurally diverse as as a company and by that I mean you operate in in 55 markets physically another 120 via via you know fly in fly out and contact and we have people from all those countries.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你正在努力改变文化中的哪些部分？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What what are the what are the parts of the culture which you are trying to change?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 协作文化的负面影响是**决策缓慢**和**执行效率低**。其中一部分将来自我前面提到的**风险规避**，这有一些遗留问题。但我认为更大的问题在于一个非常多元化的组织，人们并不总是能连接起来。你无法进行眼神交流，这意味着我无法确切知道你在说什么，以及你没有说什么。或者类似的情况。我们的银行做事有点太难了。所以其中一部分是简化流程，但很大一部分是文化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: So the negatives of the collaborative culture are the slowness of decision-making and getting things done. So some of that will come from the risk aversion that I that I mentioned earlier and you there's some legacy hangovers from that. But I think the the the bigger issue is in a very diverse organization where people don't always connect. You can't you don't have the eye contact that means that I know exactly what you're saying and what you're saying that you're not saying or something like that. We have it's a little bit too hard to get things done in our bank. So some of that is simplifying process, but a lot of that is culture.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你如何着手改变这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: And how do you go about changing that?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们正在通过机械地**简化流程**来解决银行相对复杂的问题。这是“硬件”。“软件”是更好的**反馈系统**，这样那些超越协作，实际执行并完成工作，并帮助其合作伙伴的人能够得到认可。这会影响到他们的晋升前景、薪酬或其他生活中的好事。但我们必须同等重视硬件和软件，才能真正改变这个地方的文化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: We so so we're we're tackling the the relative complexity of our bank by streamlining our processes mechanically. And then that's that's that's the hardware. The software is better feedback systems so that that we can the people who are who go beyond collaboration into actual execution and getting things done and and helping their partners are recognized as such. And that flows through to prospects for promotion or pay or or whatever else is is good in one's life. But we've got to have an equal focus on hardware and software to to really shift the culture of the place.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你如何衡量速度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: How do you benchmark speed?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 这是一个很好的问题。我们如何衡量速度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: It's a really good question. How do we benchmark speed?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 因为我们也致力于提高速度。速度是我痴迷的东西。我认为做出快速投资、快速决策的组织通常会做出更好的决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Because we also work on getting speed up. Speed is a an obsession of mine. You know, I I think organizations which make fast investment fast decisions generally make better decisions.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 是的。所以我们仔细衡量的一个指标是我们的同事对速度的感受。我们以流程为单位进行衡量，我们衡量**周转时间**。从我们开始到B点需要多少分钟、小时或天。所以，当涉及到新资产管理公司的入职时，我们希望知道我们可以将时间从60天缩短到6天，然后再缩短到6小时，最终缩短到6分钟。这可能永远不会发生，考虑到需要进行的筛选。但，以一种通用的指标来衡量速度，你给了我一个很好的挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Yep. So we one of the measures that we look at carefully is what our colleagues tell us about their sense of speed. We measure in in terms of processes, we measure **turnaround times**. Just how many minutes or hours or days does it take to get from from where we start to to point B. So when it comes to onboarding a new asset manager, we want to know that we can get that time down from 60 days to six and and then down to to six hours and eventually to six minutes. Probably never happened but given the the screening that needs to be done. But benchmarking speed generally in in one sort of universal metric, you've given me a good challenge.

</details>

### 错误处理与创新

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你提到了**风险规避**，在这种环境下你如何处理错误？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: You mentioned the the risk aversion just how do you handle mistakes in that environment.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为我对**判断失误**相当宽容，但对**原则性错误**则完全不能容忍。所以当我们发现原则性错误时，那意味着立即出局。而当出现判断失误时，除非是重大错误或频繁重复，否则是可以容忍的。我坚持要了解问题的根本原因，并了解无论错误来自何处，你将如何处理它，以确保它不再发生，或者采取最佳措施使其不再发生。但，是的，我不会说我们拥抱失败。那是一个陈词滥调。但我们有很多这样的例子。例如，我们建立了一个**风险投资实验室**。这个风险投资实验室非常成功。我们创建了**香港**和**新加坡**最好的数字银行。我们在**印度**和**英国**实现了风险投资的商业化。我们的风险投资实验室获得了良好的投资资本回报。现在，在漏斗的顶端是我们考察过的2000或2300项投资。在漏斗的底端，我们有40项已经实质性商业化的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I think I'm quite tolerant of errors of judgment and I'm completely intolerant of errors of principle. So when we find an error or principle, it's an instant out. And when there's an error of judgment, there's there's a unless it's material or very frequently repeated, it's it's indulged. I I insist on understanding what the root cause of the of the problem was and understanding how what wherever the mistake came from, how you're going to deal with it to make sure it doesn't come again or to take best steps for it not to come again. But yeah, that's I wouldn't say we embrace failure. That's that's a that's a that's cliche. But we have plenty of it. So for example, we have a we set up a **venture lab**. The **venture lab** has been extremely successful. We've created, you know, the the best digital banks in **Hong Kong** and **Singapore**. We've, you know, monetized ventures in in **India** and and in the **UK**. We've got a good return on invested capital in our **venture lab**. Now, at the top of the funnel is 2,000 investments or 2,300 investments that we've looked at. At the bottom end of the funnel, we've got 40 that we've materially commercialized.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我们有五项已经完全商业化了。所以在那1960项中有很多失败。并非所有都是失败。其中一些我们只是决定终止。但，所以我们非常乐意尝试，然后不成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And we've got five that we've completely commercialized. So that's there's a lot of failure in that 1,960 um not all failures. Some of them we just decided to discontinue. But the uh so perfectly happy to to try and and then not succeed.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 有时就是失败。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Sometimes is failure.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 这实际上有助于改变公司内部的氛围，你知道，尝试并失败总比根本不尝试要好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And that actually has helped to change the I think the tone within the company that that you know better to try and fail than to not have tried at all.

</details>

### 榜样与领导力特质

**Nicolola Tangan**: 是的。Bill，银行里的每个人都会看着你，你是榜样。你如何利用这个榜样来灌输和践行你希望其他人效仿的企业文化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Yeah. So Bill you are everybody in the bank would look at you right you are the role model. How do you how do you use that role model to breathe and live the corporate culture that you want other people to replicate?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 你知道，这个榜样问题很有趣，因为我不太愿意成为一个榜样，尤其是在像我们这样多元化的银行里。因为我算什么？我是一个在美国生活了32年的美国人，并且在世界各地度过了很多时间。但我希望榜样是高级管理人员的集合体，比如在银行工作了25年的**香港**人，在银行工作了两年的**欧洲**人，**印度**人，**非洲**人等等。我们作为一个整体是榜样，如果我们作为一个无缝的团队协同工作，尽管我们来自不同的文化、语言和组织背景，我们才真正是一个集体榜样。所以，我希望人们从我身上看到的是，冒险是可以的。好奇心是很重要的。我非常**好奇**，我希望与我共事的人也极其好奇，我希望他们极其**有同理心**。对我来说，这两个词是领导力的决定性特征：**好奇心**和**同理心**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: You know, this role model question is interesting because I I one I'm not keen to be a role model a the role I'm not keen to be the role model especially in a bank that's as diverse as ours because like what am I? I'm I'm an American guy who's lived in the **UK** for 32 years and and spent a lot of time around the world. But when I what I would like the role model to be is the aggregation of the senior managers who's the the person from **Hong Kong** who's been in the bank for 25 years, the person from **Europe** who's been in the bank for two years, the person from **India**, the person from **Africa**, etc. And collectively we're a role model and and and we're really collectively a role model if we work together as a seamless team despite the fact that we come from very different backgrounds both culturally, linguistically and and and organizationally. So, but yeah, but what what I would like people to see for me is that it's okay to take risk. It's okay to to I mean, you've got to be curious. I'm I'm super curious and I want the people that work with me to be extremely curious themselves and I want them to be extremely empathetic. Those to me are the two defining terms for leadership are are **curiosity** and **empathy**.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你认为现在是什么驱动着你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What do you say that drive drives you now?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 好奇心和同理心。我非常好奇。我热爱学习。我的意思是，这也很陈词滥调，但它确实是事实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: **Curiosity** and **empathy**. I I'm I'm extremely curious. I I love learning. I I mean and that's also very cliche but it just happens to be true.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你现在想学些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What are the kind of things you try to learn now?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我在很多不同的领域学习。当然，我们所处的环境每天都在变化，我目前正在学习很多关于**地缘政治**的知识。我正在学习很多关于**创新**的知识，我一直好奇创新是可以教授的，还是性格特征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: So I learn in lots of different realms. I of course the environment that we're operating in is changing every day and I'm learning a lot about **geopolitics** at the moment. I'm learning a lot about **innovation** and I've always been curious whether innovation can be taught or it's a character trait.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What do you think?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我不知道。我认为有些人天生好奇，我认为其他人可以通过训练获得创新特质。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I don't know. I think some people are innately curious and I think other people can adopt sorry innately innovative and I think other people can adopt innovative characteristics through training.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 为什么有些人比其他人更好奇？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Why are some people more curious than others?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我想这或多或少始于子宫，但我知道我成长在一个极其好奇的家庭。我们没有很多钱去旅行，但当我们攒到一点钱时，我们就会尝试去看看世界，因为它是一些新的、不同的东西。现在我做同样的事情还能拿到报酬。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I probably starts in the womb more or less, but I I know I I grew up in an extremely curious household and we didn't have a lot of money to travel around, but we but when we scraped a little bit together, we tried to see the world because it was something new and something different. And now I'm getting paid to do the same thing. It's fantastic.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你认为**抱负**和**好奇心**是相辅相成的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Do you think ambition and curiosity go together?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为是的。抱负有点像诅咒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: I do. I do. Ambition is a bit of a curse.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Tell me.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我认为抱负会导致**永恒的不满**，除非你在某个时候失去抱负。所以我觉得这有点像诅咒。有时我希望自己没有抱负。有时我希望...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Well, I think ambition leads to perpetual dissatisfaction unless you're unless you lose the ambition at some point. And so I think it's a bit of a curse. So sometimes I wish I wasn't ambitious. Sometimes I wish...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你是不是一直不满意？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Are you like perpetually dissatisfied?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我总是想继续前进。

**Bill Winters**: 我有这个**iPhone**，它很适合做这个。我的妻子也差不多同时起床。如果我幸运的话，我们一起起床，喝杯咖啡，然后我再去上班。当然，我经常出差。所以很多时候我一个人在床上，在这种情况下我可以多待一会儿。

<details>

**Bill Winters**: 工作方面，就是隔夜收到的所有研究、新闻和邮件。在我的空闲时间，我每天都会尽量抽出一点空闲时间，我通常会读小说，而且通常是那种很难读懂的小说。我喜欢被挑战。我不知道为什么，但我就是这样。

**Bill Winters**: So well for for for work it's whatever comes in overnight which is a lot of research and and at news and and emails in my free time and I do try to get a little bit of free time every day. I typically read fiction and I typically fiction that's that's kind of hard to get through. I want to be challenged. I don't know why but I do.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 给我举个难读的小说例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Give me an example of a hard fiction book.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 好的。我现在读的其实不是小说。我正在读**乔治·桑德斯**（George Saunders）的书。他是一位出色的**美国短篇小说**作家，但也写过一些小说，获得过**普利策奖**等奖项。我大约15年前在**纽约州北部**听过他的一次讲座。他非常棒。他写了一本关于**俄罗斯短篇小说**的书，他认为这是完美的文学形式。所以书中有六篇**俄罗斯短篇小说**，包括**契诃夫**（Chekhov）、**屠格涅夫**（Turgenev）等人的作品。然后他逐页分析它们，这实际上是一堂大学讲座。所以它有点像小说，因为故事是虚构的。但其余部分是讲座。我为什么读它？因为它真的很有趣。

**Bill Winters**: All right. So, what am I? So, I mean, right now it's actually not fiction. Well, it's So, I'm reading **George Saunders**. He's a fabulous, American short story author, but he's also written some novels, is one pullet surprises, things like that. And I actually, attended a lecture of his in upstate **New York** about 15 years ago. He's fabulous. So, he's he's written a a a book on the **Russian short story**, which he considers to be the perfect form. So, it's six **Russian short short stories**, a **Czechov**, **Jurgenov**, and others. And then he analyzes them and it's actually a an it's a university lecture and analyzes it page by page. So it's kind of fiction because the story is fiction. But the rest is a lecture. Why do I read that? Because it's just really interesting.

### 戏剧与社区

**Nicolola Tangan**: 你和你的妻子非常喜欢戏剧，你的妻子在**诺丁山**经营着**科内特剧院**，顺便说一下，他们有时会用挪威语上演**挪威戏剧**。你能想象吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Now you and your wife are very into theater and your wife runs the **Cornet Theater** in **Notting Hill** where they by the way sometimes put on Norwegian plays in Norwegian. Can you imagine?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 它们场场爆满。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: And they are sellouts?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: They are. They are.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 为什么戏剧对你们来说如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Why why is theater so important for you guys?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 嗯，这是我妻子的剧院。我提供精神支持。但我喜欢它，因为它显然是我的另一种生活。实际上，当我走进**伦敦诺丁山**的**科内特剧院**时，我就是她的丈夫，仅此而已。如果我穿着西装，他们会问：“为什么你是这里唯一一个穿灰色西装的人？”所以别担心，那是我妻子。但，不，我认为回馈我们的社区对我们所有人来说都极其重要，这可以有很多不同的形式。这个剧院专注于国际作品。它 prominently 呈现**挪威作品**。我想我们是第一家在**扬·福瑟**（著名挪威剧作家）获得**诺贝尔奖**后上演他作品的剧院。没错。如果你没记错的话，你可能也帮过忙。能够在一个当地社区拥有这样的地位，是非常特别的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Well, this is my wife's theater. I'm moral support and and I and but I love it because it's obviously it's it's an alternative it's it's an alternative life for me actually when I go into the **Cornet Theater** in **Notting Hill** in **London** I'm's husband and period full stop and if I'm wearing a business suit they say like why are you the only guy here in a in a gray suit and so don't worry about that there's my wife but no it's um I think it's extremely important for all of us to to give back to our communities in our own ways and that can come in lots of different forms forms. This is a theater that focuses on international work. It features prominently **Norwegian work**. I think we had I think we were the first theater to put on **Jon Fosse**, the famous **Norwegian playwright** after he won the **Nobel Prize**. That's right. And which if I'm not mistaken you may have helped with and that's a it's very special to to have that kind of a position in in in a local community.

**Nicolola Tangan**: 每个人都应该看哪部剧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: What's the play that everybody should see?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 哦，每个人都应该看的剧太多了。嗯，每个人都应该看**《哈姆雷特》**。我想大多数人都看过《哈姆雷特》，但如果你没看过，那是因为它就是关于生与死、权力、同理心、好奇心和不安全感等人生悲剧的经典故事。但它不是很现代，也许可以说它是永恒的。也许**易卜生**经常被称为**欧洲的莎士比亚**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Oh, there's so many plays that everybody should see. The um well everybody should see **Hamlet** just I think most people have seen **Hamlet** but if you haven't it's because it's it is just the the classic story of the tragedy of life and death and power and and and empathy and curiosity and and insecurity etc etc but but uh but not very modern uh although but maybe say timeless uh maybe the **Ibsen** is frequently referred to as the as the European **Shakespeare** or the...

</details>

**Nicolola Tangan**: 嗯，我认为他是仅次于**莎士比亚**的剧作家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Well I think is the number who played playwright after after **Shakespeare**.

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 是的。理由充分。无论是**《玩偶之家》**，那会是一部相当不错的作品，或者，我大概就说到这里吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: Yep. And for good reason. And and whether it's the you know, **Doll's House** would be would be a pretty good one or probably probably I'd probably stop there.

### 给年轻人的建议

**Nicolola Tangan**: 是的。Bill，除了看这部剧，你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangan**: Yeah. So, Bill, in in addition to seeing this place, what is your advice to young people?

</details>

**Bill Winters**: 我对年轻人的建议是，坚持走这条路，但不要太久，然后找到一种方式。有一位著名的美国人叫**尤吉·贝拉**（Yogi Berra），他说：“当你走到岔路口时，走过去。”你得想一想才能意识到这有多荒谬。但它的要点是，你知道，当你时不时遇到转折点时，走**鲁莽的路线**。如果你在早期走鲁莽的路线，你可以很容易地恢复过来。不要在职业生涯的最后阶段走鲁莽的路线。但在开始时，当你问到年轻人时，要**敢于冒险**。我可以说我整个职业生涯只做了两三个决定。你知道，其中一个就是来到**渣打银行**。另一个就是进入我前面提到的那个**衍生品业务**，那是40年前，30年前的事了。这些是我做出的最好的两个决定，因为它们非常，它们实际上是鲁莽的。放弃我在资产管理公司舒适的生活，去为这家挣扎中的新兴市场贸易银行工作，对我来说是鲁莽的。但它对我来说非常成功。我之所以这样做，是因为我认为这将是一个巨大的挑战，而且我非常喜欢冒险。我早年也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bill Winters**: My advice to young young people is stay on the path but not for very long and find a way. There was a famous American called **Yogi Berra** who said, "When you get to a fork in the road, take it." Which you have to think about a little bit to realize how ridiculous that is. But but but the gist of it is, you know, when you when you do come to a a a turning point from time to time, go the **reckless route**. And if you go the reckless route early, you can recover very easily. Don't go the reckless route right at the end of your working life. But in the beginning, and then you ask about young people, take a risk. And I can I can say I only made two or three decisions my whole working life. You know, one of them was to come to **Standard Chartered**. One of them was to go into that **derivative business** that I talked about earlier, which was 40 years earlier, 30 years earlier. And those are two of the best decisions I took because they were very they were reckless actually. It was reckless for me to give up my cozy life and asset management and and go work for this struggling emerging markets trade bank. But it's worked out really well for me. And I did it because I thought it would be a great challenge and I quite enjoy risk and the same thing back in my earlier days.

**Nicolola Tangan**: 是的。嗯，我会说它们确实非常成功。很高兴与你交谈。非常感谢。一切顺利。
