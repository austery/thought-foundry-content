title: 市场周报：美股震荡与日本债券收益率飙升背后的逻辑

### 市场概览：美股波动与日本债券异动

大家好，今天是11月22日，这里是《市场周报》。过去一周，市场经历了异常激动人心的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello my friends. Today is November 22nd and this is Markets Weekly. So this past week was a tremendously exciting week in markets.</p>
</details>

我们看到股市出现了大量的波动。许多人都在猜测，人工智能（AI）泡沫是否终于破裂，我们是否即将进入**熊市**（Bare market: 指市场价格普遍下跌，投资者信心低迷的时期），甚至是一场崩盘；或者，这可能仅仅是上升趋势中的一次普通的**修正**（Correction: 市场价格在上涨趋势中出现短期下跌，通常跌幅在10%以内）。毕竟，股市已经有一段时间没有出现哪怕是5%的修正了，而现在它终于发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had a lot of volatility in the equity markets. Uh many are wondering whether or not the AI bubble has finally popped and now we're going to see a bare market or maybe even a crash or it could just simply be a garden variety in a correction in a upward trend. After all, it's been some time since the equity market had even a 5% correction, which uh it's finally had.</p>
</details>

所以，今天我们来谈两件事。首先，我们来讨论过去一周股市发生了什么；其次，我们聊聊日本的情况，因为日本的债券收益率正在急剧飙升，但似乎没有人关心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, today, let's talk about two things. First off, let's talk about what happened in the equity market the past week, and let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Japan because Japanese bond yields are absolutely surging. Uh but no one seems to care.</p>
</details>

### 美股市场：S&P 500失守关键均线

首先从股市说起。本周早些时候，市场显得有些摇摇欲坠。我们看到**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标普500指数，衡量美国大型上市公司股票表现的指数）跌破了**50日移动平均线**（50-day moving average: 技术分析指标，显示过去50个交易日股价的平均值）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, starting with the equity markets first. Earlier in the week, the market was looking a bit shaky. We saw the S&P 500 lose the 50-day moving average.</p>
</details>

交易市场的人常常将移动平均线视为动能的潜在信号。当跌破50日移动平均线时，可能意味着动能正在减弱，趋势可能正在改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, people who trade markets often look at moving averages as a potential signal of momentum. Whereas, when you fall below the 50-day moving average, maybe you are losing momentum. Maybe the trend is changing.</p>
</details>

### 市场焦点：非农就业与英伟达财报

市场关注的两大焦点，当然是延迟发布的9月**非农就业数据**（Non-farm payrolls: 美国劳工部每月公布的就业报告，衡量除农业部门以外的就业人数变化）以及至关重要的英伟达（Nvidia）财报。非农就业数据实际上是喜忧参半的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The poo two big things the market was watching was of course the delayed non-formance payroll sprint for September and the allimportant Nvidia earnings. The non-farmms pay peril sprint was actually kind of mixed.</p>
</details>

从表面上看，总体数据非常好：9月份创造了10万个就业岗位。然而，它也伴随着向下修正，导致我们实际上在前一个月出现了失业。这将是今年连续两个月的负就业数据，通常在经济衰退来临前会看到这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the surface, the headline number was really good. 100,000 jobs created in September. However, it also came with down revisions such that we actually had job losses the prior month. That would be two months of negative job prints this year. Usually things usually something you see when you were heading into a recession.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还看到失业率小幅上升至4.4%。所以这是一个喜忧参半的数据，但更重要的是，它被认为是过时的。这发生在几个月前，而在此期间，我们已经有了私人就业数据和调查，这些都表明劳动力市场持续疲软，美联储（Fed）官员也驳斥了这些数据为过时信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, also we saw the unemployment rate tick up a bit to 4.4%. So it was a mixed bag but more importantly it was considered to be stale. This is something that happened months ago and between then and now we've had you know private job data and also surveys that suggest um kind of ongoing weakness in the labor market and Fed speakers also dismissed the data as stale.</p>
</details>

过去一周更重要的数据是英伟达的财报。迄今为止的牛市很大程度上是由对AI概念股的兴奋所驱动的，而AI运动的代表当然是英伟达。因此，人们普遍认为，如果英伟达的财报表现不佳，可能意味着**人工智能泡沫**（AI bubble: 指对人工智能技术及其相关公司估值过高，脱离基本面的一种市场现象）终于结束，市场将彻底崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The much more important print the past week was the Nvidia earnings. So much of the bull market so far has been driven by excitement in AI names and you know the general of the AI movement is of course Nvidia. So it was widely perceived that if we had a bad Nvidia print maybe the AI hype is finally over and we would just implode.</p>
</details>

### AI的局限性：个人经历分享

顺便提一下，有时我也会尝试使用AI来帮助我的工作。但说实话，它并没有特别大的帮助。我做的很多事情，当然是弄清楚美联储将采取什么行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As an aside, I'd also note that sometimes I also try to use AI to um uh help my workload. And uh honestly, it hasn't really been super helpful. So, a lot of the things that I do, of course, is figuring out what the Fed is going to do.</p>
</details>

因此，如果AI能直接告诉我下周谁将发言，这样我就知道该关注谁，那将非常有帮助。本周早些时候，我问AI：“你能给我一份下周美联储发言人的表格吗？”令人印象深刻的是，它确实给了我一份美联储发言人的表格。所有这些美联储官员，虽然没人真正关心，但他们都在发言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, what's very helpful would be to just have AI tell me who is speaking next week so that I know uh who to focus on. So, earlier in the week, I I asked AI, can you give me a table of Fed speakers this coming week? And you know, very impressively, it gave me a table of Fed speakers. All these Fed people that no one really cares about are are speaking.</p>
</details>

但当然，我真正想知道的是它能否帮助我了解那些真正重要的人物是否会发言。例如，**沃勒理事**（Governor Waller），他是**联邦公开市场委员会**（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee，美联储的主要货币政策制定机构）中更具影响力的政策制定者之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but what I really wanted to know, of course, was whether or not it could help me with kind of knowing what the really important people are speaking. Uh, for example, Governor Waller, who is one of the more influential policy makers on the FOMC.</p>
</details>

在询问AI之前，我当然得先弄清楚AI是否能完成它的工作。所以我查看了美联储的网站，在其下周的日程安排中，我看到沃勒理事将在周一发言。当我要求AI给我一份美联储发言人表格时，它确实给了我一份表格，列出了很多人，但其中没有沃勒理事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, before asking the AI, of course, I had to figure out whether or not the AI could do its job. So, I looked at the Federal Reserve's website and I saw under its schedule for the coming week that Governor Waller would be speaking on Monday. And when I asked the AI to give me a table of Fed speakers, uh, it gave me a table, a lot of people, but there was no Governor Waller.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，AI也会犯错。也许这是一个错误。于是我特意提供了美联储的网站，并要求它再次检查。我问它沃勒理事是否会发言，它告诉我不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, AI makes a mistake. Maybe this is a mistake. So, I gave it specifically the Federal Reserve's website and asking to check again. And I asked him whether or not Governor Waller was going to speak. It told me no.</p>
</details>

这再次让我感到困惑，因为我在美联储的网站上看到了。所以我第三次询问，这次我用引号引出了美联储网站上我希望它查看的具体部分。我问它：“你能去网站的这个部分，告诉我沃勒理事下周是否会发言吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, this is kind of confusing to me because I see it on the Federal Reserve's website. So I asked it a third time and this time I prompted it with the specific uh in quotes section of the Federal Reserve's website I wanted to look under. Can you go to this section of the website and tell me whether or not Governor Waller is speaking uh the next this coming week?</p>
</details>

结果，AI（我使用的是**Grock**）再次告诉我不会。实际上，它还告诉我一些更有趣的事情：“你知道，这个网站使用的是**Ajax**（Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: 一种用于创建交互式网页的技术，允许网页在不重新加载整个页面的情况下更新内容），它可能已经过时了。所以这也许就是我们在这里产生困惑的原因。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, the AI and I'm using Grock told me no. And actually, it told me something even more interesting. You know, this website is using Ajax. It's probably out of date. And so maybe this is why we're having confusion here.</p>
</details>

我看到这个，简直是惊叹不已。AI甚至比美联储的网站还要聪明吗？哇！如果真是这样，我必须使用AI，因为我将获得比公共部门更好的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I saw that and I was like insanely impressed. Is the AI even smarter than the Federal Reserve's website? Wow. If that's the case, I got to use AI because I'm going to get even better information than the public sector.</p>
</details>

然而，随着一周的进展，沃勒理事确实在周一发言了。所以网站是正确的。Grock在被问了三次之后，甚至无法告诉我有一位如此有影响力的政策制定者在周一发言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then as the week progressed, Governor Waller did in fact speak on Monday. And so the website was correct. Grock after asking him three times could not even tell me that there was such an influential policy policy maker speaking on Monday.</p>
</details>

因此，我不得不说AI是有用的，但如果我必须去核实，而且它会犯这些大错误，那么我永远无法依赖它。所以我个人再次认为，这些AI应用不会赚钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I have to say that AI is useful, but you also it but really I if I have to go check and he can make these big mistakes, it's never something that I'm going to be able to rely on. And so I personally again think that these AI applications are not going to make money.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达财报与市场剧烈反应

但这并不是当前真正的问题。问题当然是生态系统中有些部分确实赚钱，那就是英伟达。那么，英伟达是否真的给市场留下了深刻印象呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's not really the problem at the moment. The problem of course is that there are parts of the ecosystem that do make money and that is Nvidia. So did Nvidia actually um impress the market.</p>
</details>

我收听了英伟达的财报会议。这实际上是我第一次听大型科技公司的财报会议，因为这通常不是我关注的重点。财报会议上全是好消息，对吧？一切都全速运转，我们产品售罄，市场潜力巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I tuned in to Nvidia earnings. It was actually the first big tech earnings I've ever listened to. That's this is not usually something I focus on. And uh the earnings conference was nothing but good news, right? It was everything is firing in all cylinders. We're sold out. Huge huge potential marketplace.</p>
</details>

我们有所有这些传统公司将转向**GPU计算**（GPU compute: 利用图形处理器进行通用计算，尤其适用于并行处理任务，如AI训练）。一切都非常棒。我们正在创造巨大的收益，增长不可能更高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have all these legacy guys who are going to go moving on to uh GPU compute. Everything is great. Uh we're generating tremendous amounts of earnings and growth cannot be higher.</p>
</details>

这些都是真的。英伟达继续创造着巨大的现金流。他们正在签订新的协议，例如与沙特阿拉伯的合作。一切都一片光明。市场也这样认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's all true. Nvidia continues to generate tremendous tremendous amounts of cash. They're inking new deals. For example, with Saudi Arabia, everything is nothing but blue skies. And the market perceived that as well.</p>
</details>

英伟达股价在盘后上涨了5%，这是一个巨大的涨幅。第二天开盘后，这一涨幅一直保持着。第二天，一切似乎都进展顺利，市场正在飙升，甚至可能重新突破50日移动平均线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had Nvidia stock up 5% after market. And that's basically a gain. It held all through market open the following day. The following day uh it seemed like everything was going really well and uh market was surging, maybe even potentially overtaking the uh 50-day moving average,</p>
</details>

但随后，一切突然崩塌。看到如此积极的开盘，却跌入绝望，**S&P 500**甚至跌破了100日移动平均线，这是一个非常非常糟糕的日子。市场充满了巨大的恐惧，你可以从波动性结构中看到，**固定行权波动率**（Fixed strike volatility: 期权市场中衡量特定行权价期权隐含波动率的指标，反映市场对未来价格波动的预期）正在急剧上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but then out of nowhere everything just tumbled. It was a very very ugly day to see uh such a positive opening. uh tumble down into basically despair with the S&P 500 even losing the 100 day moving average. There was tremendous fear in the markets and you can see and through the volatility structure where fixed strike volatility was was basically surging higher.</p>
</details>

很多人都在购买保护，担心AI这回事可能真的要结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of people were buying protection in fear of maybe this AI thing it's really all over.</p>
</details>

### 市场反弹与潜在原因分析

然而，周五情况有所好转。似乎发生的情况是，如果波动性如此之高，就很难维持住**V型挤压**（V crush: 市场波动率在短期内急剧下降的现象）。但同时，纽约联储主席威廉姆斯（Fed President Williams），作为**FOMC**中最有影响力的政策制定者之一，基本上表示他希望在12月降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On Friday though things did get a little bit better. Um, so it what seemed to happen was that well again if you have volatility so high you just can't it's hard to sustain a little bit of a V crush but also we had go uh Fed President Williams of the New York Fed one of the most influential policy makers on the FOMC basically tell you that he wants a December cut which in my view makes a December cut given uh the other speakers um very very likely event and that seemed to suit the market as well.</p>
</details>

在我看来，考虑到其他发言人的表态，这使得12月降息成为一个非常非常可能的事件，这似乎也符合市场的预期。所以，我们最终确实重新站上了100日移动平均线，但市场看起来并不好，市场情绪受到了损害。技术指标也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So, we did eventually end up regaining the 100 day moving average, but it does just doesn't look good and sentiment has been damaged. Uh technicos as well.</p>
</details>

那么，造成这一切的原因实际上是个谜。为什么会发生这种情况，并不是非常清楚。我的意思是，英伟达确实超出了预期，而且当天并没有明显的坏消息会导致这种情况发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what caused this is actually kind of a mystery. It's not super clear why. I mean, Nvidia did beat and there wasn't really obvious bad news on that day that would cause this to happen.</p>
</details>

当然，背景中一直在发生的一件事是比特币（Bitcoin）一直在崩盘。过去几周它一直表现不佳，但最近更是彻底暴跌，跌至约8万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one thing that's been happening in the background, of course, was that Bitcoin has been basically imploding. Now, it's been trading very poorly for the past few weeks, but this more recently just basically absolutely tumbled, imploding uh to about $80,000.</p>
</details>

所以，如果我猜测这背后发生了什么，那只是大量的投机，我会说这是一种大规模的**散户去杠杆化**（Retail deleveraging: 散户投资者减少其借贷投资，平仓高杠杆头寸的行为）。许多AI概念股和科技股都是由散户参与驱动的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if I were to guess what was happening behind this, it's just that a lot of the speculation, well, I would say that it's a kind of a massive retail deleveraging. So, a lot of the AI names and a lot of tech stock is driven by retail participation.</p>
</details>

他们一直在购买看涨期权，不断投入，而且效果非常显著。当然，这也是大量购买加密货币的投资者群体。随着加密货币的崩盘，我不得不认为这严重打击了他们的投资组合，可能促使他们去杠杆化，听到关于加密货币投资者（他们常常进行巨额杠杆投资）收到**追加保证金通知**（Margin calls: 经纪商要求投资者存入额外资金以弥补亏损，避免强制平仓的通知）的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They've been buying calls, just pouring in, and it's been working spectacularly. And of course, this is also the investor base that's bought a lot of crypto stuff. And with crypto imploding, I have to imagine that that's been uh hitting their portfolios a lot, maybe prompting the leveraging, hear news flashes about crypto investors who often times invest in tremendous leverage, basically getting margin calls.</p>
</details>

我猜想，如果这种情况正在发生，他们可能也会在科技股等风险领域进行收缩。所以，这可能只是一次市场震荡。如果真是这样，那么我认为这应该是可以恢复的。毕竟，在如此好的行情之后，出现一些去杠杆化是完全正常的，也许我们会再次上涨，我想这可能就是我将要写的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I imagine that if that's happening uh they may be retrenching also in the risk space here as well in tech stocks. So maybe that that is kind of just a shakeout over there. Now if that's the case then you know this is I would assume that this is something that uh could be recoverable after all you have some deleveraging totally normal uh after such a good run and maybe we just go back higher and I think that's probably what I'm going to write about.</p>
</details>

考虑到政策和政治领域正在发生的许多其他事情，我更倾向于认为这更可能是一次修正，而不是熊市的开始或市场崩盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I view this probably as more of a more likely to be a correction uh given than a beginning of a bare market or implosion uh given a a lot of things that are other things that are happening in the policy and political space.</p>
</details>

无论如何，我们也将进入一个季节性更积极的时期。也许圣诞老人不会来，或者圣诞老人会给我们一大块煤炭。但现在还早，我们才刚刚进入假日季节。所以，让我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh in any case, we're also heading into a more seasonally positive time. It could be that Santa is not coming or maybe Santa is giving us a huge lump of coal. But again it's it's early and we are just heading into the off into the holiday season. So um let's uh let's see what happens.</p>
</details>

### 日本债券收益率飙升：被市场忽视的异象

我想谈的第二件事当然是日本正在发生的事情。日本债券收益率正在悄无声息地飙升，似乎被市场忽视了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the second thing that I want to talk about of course is what's happening in Japan. So quietly quietly seemingly uh ignored by the market. Japanese bond yields were absolutely surging.</p>
</details>

通常，这会是一个大新闻，因为当日本债券收益率上升时，通常会带动全球债券收益率上升。而且，如果债券收益率上升，通常会对风险市场产生负面反应。但如果你看看美国国债收益率，10年期收益率一直在稳步下降，部分原因当然是市场预期降息，而且股市也出现了一定程度的避险情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, usually this would be kind of a big news because when Japanese bond yields are rising, that usually drags up bond yields globally and you know if you have bond yields rising, you would see uh usually it's a negative reaction in the risk market. But if you look at treasury yields, the 10-year yield has been steadily declining in part of course due to expectations of cuts and also um you do have kind of a riskoff episode in the equity market.</p>
</details>

除此之外，通常当你看到日本债券收益率上升时，日元会走强，这可能会对**日元套利交易**（Yen carry trade: 投资者借入低利率的日元，然后将其兑换成其他货币，投资于高收益资产的策略）造成某种程度的扰乱。在这种情况下，那些借入日元并在世界其他地方购买风险资产的人会撤资，出售风险资产，比如美国的股票，然后将这些美元兑换回日元以偿还债务。这意味着日元会走强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in addition to that, usually when you see Japanese bond yields rising, you would see the yen strengthening and that could have some kind of disruption in the yen carry trade. Whereas people who are uh borrowing yen and and buying risk assets elsewhere in the world would uh retrench uh sell risk assets say uh equities in the US, take those dollars and repay yen. So that means the yen would strengthen.</p>
</details>

但这种情况也没有发生。那么日本到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's not happening either. So what's going on in Japan?</p>
</details>

### 日本市场趋势的驱动因素：财政刺激与央行独立性

首先，我认为日本正在发生的事情，很大程度上与美国正在发生的事情类似。在美国，我们再次面临巨大的**财政赤字**（Fiscal deficits: 政府支出超过收入的部分）、巨大的财政刺激以及对**货币政策独立性**（Monetary policy independence: 中央银行在制定和执行货币政策时不受政府或其他政治干预的能力）丧失的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first off, I think it's it's basically um a lot of the what's happening in the US is also happening in Japan. So in the US, we have again big fiscal deficits, tremendous fiscal stimulus and also concerns of a loss of monetary policy independence. That's a concern in the US. It's actually a concern in Japan as well.</p>
</details>

这在美国是一个担忧，在日本也是一个担忧。新当选的首相**Tekkashi**承诺将增加财政支出。她希望解决日本公民对生活成本的一些担忧，并向那些受生活成本危机困扰的人提供**补贴**（Subsidies: 政府为支持特定行业或减轻民众负担而提供的财政援助）或**刺激支票**（Stimmies: 政府直接向民众发放的现金，旨在刺激经济）等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the newly elected Prime Minister Tekkashi, she is uh promising to have more fiscal spending. She wants to address some of the cost of living concerns that Japanese citizens have had and are offering things like u uh subsidies or stemmies to to people who are suffering from cost of living crisis.</p>
</details>

对吧？我们在美国也看到了这种情况。对于生活成本问题，世界各地的政治家们普遍流行的一个答案就是给公民更多的钱。当然，这显然不是一个很好的解决方案，对吧？刺激支票并不是解决通货膨胀的好办法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? We see we see this in the US as well. One answer one popular answer to cost of living problems that politicians have everywhere in the world is to just give other citizens more money. And of course that obviously is not a very good solution, right? uh stim checks are not a good solution to inflation.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，它们在政治上很受欢迎，看起来他们即将实施自疫情以来最大的财政支出和财政刺激方案。除此之外，还有人担心日本央行（Bank of Japan）可能会受到政治压力，无法以至少他们预期的速度加息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in any case, they're politically popular and it looks like they're about to embark upon the largest uh fiscal spending that fiscal stimulus package uh they've seen since the pandemic. And in addition to that, there are also concerns that maybe the Bank of Japan is going to be subject to political pressure and not able to raise rates as as at least at the pace that they were expecting.</p>
</details>

政府有一些评论，希望日本央行能够“暂停”或“放慢”加息步伐。因此，在这方面，这正在对货币造成压力，也使得通胀预期有些令人担忧。如果你看看日本的通货膨胀，**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者物价指数，衡量一篮子商品和服务价格变化的指标，反映通货膨胀水平）为3%，这与美国的情况相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's some commentary from the government there to you know Bank of Japan can you you know kind of hold off on this or maybe slow down and so in that respect that's kind of weighing on currency and also uh it's also making inflation expectations a little bit concerned if you look at inflation in Japan the CPI is 3% which is the same it's been same as it is in the US so inflation continues to be a problem in Japan and as it is in the US 3% of course higher than their 2% target.</p>
</details>

所以，通货膨胀在日本和美国一样，仍然是一个问题，3%当然高于他们2%的目标。因此，这种情况的结合是，你基本上有一个政府正在故意推行一些相当积极的名义增长政策——大额支出，并控制中央银行不加息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the combination of this is you're basically having a government that is purposely uh doing some uh pretty uh I guess nominal growth positive policy big spending controlling the central bank to not hike rates.</p>
</details>

因此，这种情况的结合显然导致了货币走弱、债券收益率上升以及股市更加活跃，这正是我们在**日经指数**（Nikkei: 日本东京证券交易所的股票市场指数，通常指日经225指数）中看到的，它再次飙升。它与美国市场同步出现了一些下跌，但在过去几个月里，它绝对是飙升的。这基本上是一个正在**再通胀**（Reflating: 经济体在通货紧缩后，通过货币或财政政策刺激，使物价和经济活动回升的过程）的国家所预期的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the combination of this is obviously you have a weaker currency, higher bond yields and a much more buoyant stock market which is what we see in the Nicay basically surging again. It's having a little bit of a tumble in line with US markets but over the past few months it's absolutely surged. This is basically what you would expect in a in a country that's um reflating.</p>
</details>

### 全球影响与人口结构变化

所以，一个担忧是，随着日本债券收益率逐渐上升，这是否会在全球造成混乱，并结束日元套利交易？到目前为止，这两个问题的答案都是“否”。

<p class="english-text">So, one concern is that as Japanese bond yields gradually rise, is that going to create disorder globally and is that going to end the yen carry trade? And so far, the answer to those two questions is no.</p>
</details>

因为尽管日本债券收益率正在上升，但它们仍然远低于通货膨胀。日本债券收益率在**实际值**（Real terms: 剔除通货膨胀影响后的经济数据，反映购买力）上非常负，只是变得稍微不那么负了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because although Japanese bond yields are rising, they're still far below inflation. Japanese bond yields are very negative in real terms and only becoming slightly less negative.</p>
</details>

所以，这似乎不足以吸引资金回流。日本的投资者似乎仍在向外投资，正如你从日元的巨额**贬值**（Depreciation of the yen: 日元相对于其他货币价值下降）中可以看到的，几乎触及160点，许多人认为这会促使**财务省**（Ministry of Finance: 日本负责财政政策、预算和税收的政府部门）进行干预。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, that does not seem to be enough um enough of a pull enough of a pull to draw money back. It seems like what investors in Japan are doing is that they're still rushing out as you can see by the massive depreciation of the yen almost touching that 160 point which many think that will prompt intervention by the ministry of finance.</p>
</details>

另一件值得注意的事情是，从历史上看，对日本政府债券的需求来自寿险公司和养老基金，而这些机构目前似乎对债券不太感兴趣。部分原因是他们已经购买了大量债券，但部分原因也是人口结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One other thing to note is also historically speaking demand for Japanese government bonds comes from uh life insurers, comes from pension funds and those guys seem to be um not that interested in bonds at the moment. Part of it because they've already purchased a lot of bonds but part of it also is demographic.</p>
</details>

全球范围内一个有趣现象，我们在美国市场也看到了，那就是传统的债券买家是那些拥有**长期负债**（Long-dated liabilities: 期限较长的债务或义务，如养老金支付义务）并寻求**长期资产**（Long-dated assets: 期限较长的资产，如长期债券）来匹配这些负债的实体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the interesting things globally and we see this in the US market as well is that traditional buyers of bonds are are are entities that have longdated liabilities and are seeking longdated assets to match them.</p>
</details>

比如寿险和养老基金。而现在发生的情况是，由于人口趋势，你知道，庞大的婴儿潮一代人口，他们的预期寿命正在缩短。因此，这些实体对久期的实际需求不如以前那么大了，而新一代的人口当然比过去少，而且他们很多人甚至没有**确定给付养老金计划**（Defined benefit pension funds: 退休金金额预先确定，由雇主承担投资风险的养老金计划）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So life insurance, pension funds and what's been happening is due to demographic trends you know the huge huge big boomer population it's uh you know they they are they their life expectancy is is reducing and so the actual demand for duration by from these entities is not as large as it used to be and the newer generation of course is smaller than the past and of course a lot of them don't even have um defined benefit benefit pension funds.</p>
</details>

因此，由于人口老龄化和新一代人口减少，养老基金和寿险公司（养老基金多于寿险公司）的结构性购买力可能不再相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that structural bid from pension funds and life insurance companies, well, more pension funds than life insurance companies may not be the same uh due to aging populations and also smaller uh new generations.</p>
</details>

### 偿付能力担忧与央行控制

所以，到目前为止，日本发生的事情似乎并没有影响风险市场。归根结底，如果那里的情况变得混乱，我们知道日本央行非常愿意介入并牢牢控制债券市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so far it does not seem that the what's happening in Japan is impacting risk markets. And at the end of the day, if it ever does become disorderly over there, we know the Bank of Japan is more than willing to step in and uh have an iron grip on the bond market.</p>
</details>

我们看到他们之前实行过**收益率控制**（Yield control: 中央银行通过买卖债券来影响特定期限债券收益率的政策）和**收益率曲线控制**（Curve control: 中央银行通过买卖不同期限债券来影响整个收益率曲线形态的政策），当时运作完美，现在也会再次完美运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We saw them do yield control, curve control before, worked perfectly then, will work perfectly again.</p>
</details>

另一个担忧是，这些上升的债券收益率是否会给现有实体带来**偿付能力问题**（Solvency issues: 机构无法履行其财务义务的风险），就像我们看到硅谷银行（Silicon Valley Bank）那样，当时美国较高的收益率导致硅谷银行至少在**按市值计价**（Mark-to-market basis: 资产或负债根据当前市场价格进行估值）的基础上陷入资不抵债。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One other concern is that do these rising bond yields uh create solveny issues for current entities like we saw in Silicon Valley Bank whereas when higher yields in the US cause Silicon Valley bank to basically be um at least on a marktomarket basis insolvent.</p>
</details>

所以，当你查看日本政府债券的持有者时，一个突出特点是，超过一半的日本政府债券由日本央行持有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you look at the holders of Japanese government bonds, one thing that stands out is that over half of Japanese government bonds are held by the Bank of Japan.</p>
</details>

这意味着大部分损失将由政府社会化。他们并不真正关心，我的意思是，日本央行拥有无限的印钞机。他们是否偿付得起对他们来说并不重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that means that a lot of the losses are going to be socialized by the government. They don't really I mean Bank of Japan has infinite has a money printer. It doesn't really matter for them whether or not they're solvent.</p>
</details>

至于其他实体，比如保险公司、养老金，我假设监管机构正在密切关注他们，确保他们的账簿有足够的对冲。如果不够，政府当然可以像在美国那样解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other entities, you know, insurance companies, pensions, uh the these guys, I'm going to assume that the regulators are watching them and making sure that they have enough um uh their books are hedged enough and and if not, of course, the government could always fix that as they did uh in the US.</p>
</details>

所以，你永远不想押注债券市场崩盘，因为债券最终归根结底只是数据库中的数字，而**法定货币体系**（Fiat system: 货币价值不由实物商品（如黄金）支持，而是由政府法令确定的货币体系）中的政府总是可以控制这些数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you never really want to bet on a bond market implosion because bonds and ultimately at the end of the day, they're just numbers uh numbers in a database and the government in a fiat system can can always control that.</p>
</details>

不太可能被控制的是货币。到目前为止，日元似乎处于几乎自由落体的状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's less likely to be controlled is the currency. Um, and so far uh looks like the Japanese yen is in almost freef fall. Um, okay.</p>
</details>

### 总结与展望

好的，这就是我今天准备的所有内容。下周是感恩节周。所以感恩节周将不会有视频，因为在美国，那是一个非常平静的日子，非常平静的一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's all I prepared for today. Next week is Thanksgiving week. So Thanksgiving week there will be no videos because in the US that's a very very sleepy day, very sleepy week.</p>
</details>

主要是一个假日周。所以可能不会有很多可谈论的。但请再次密切关注股市。我们是要彻底崩盘，还是这只是一次修正？好的，我们12月再聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh mostly a holiday week. So there's not probably not going to be much to talk about. But again, watch closely the equity markets. Are we just going to implode or is this a correction? All right, talk to you all uh in December.</p>
