summary: 本周股市以惨淡收场，市场普遍下跌。核心驱动因素包括持续疲软的劳动力市场数据、对动量股的获利了结，以及美国政府长期停摆对经济的负面影响。个股方面，特斯拉股东批准了马斯克的万亿薪酬方案，同时马斯克暗示可能自建芯片厂以应对算力瓶颈。美国政府升级对华芯片禁令，禁止英伟达和AMD向中国销售任何重要AI芯片。OpenAI的融资言论引发市场担忧，而Grab与GoTo的合并传闻则为市场带来一丝波澜。

title: 市场动荡：马斯克获天价薪酬，英伟达对华销售受阻，美股全线下跌
---

### 市场开盘概览：全线普跌

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月7日，星期五，感谢各位的到来。今天盘前市场表现糟糕，为本周股市的惨淡画上了一个句号。这真是难熬的一天，但老实说，过去几天一直都有这种感觉，所以我理解大家普遍感到很烦恼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Friday, November 7th. Thank you everybody for being here. It is an ugly pre-market to cap off a ugly ugly week in the stock market and it's just one of those days. It is one of those days, but it has felt like one of those days honestly for the past couple days and so I understand it is pretty annoying across the board.</p>
</details>

我们有很多不同的头条新闻和昨天发布的财报需要关注。显然，目前盘前市场情况很糟糕。以太坊和比特币也未能幸免，以太坊价格在3200美元左右，比特币目前在100200美元，而大约一小时前还在99100美元。虽然你看到了一点反弹，但整体上还是承受着相当大的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot of different headlines, got a lot of different earnings from yesterday to cover. Obviously things are ugly right now in the pre-market. Ethereum and Bitcoin not really holding up. Ethereum right there at 3200. Bitcoin right now at 100.2. It was just at 99.1 about an hour ago. And so you are seeing a little bit of rebound, but nonetheless, you're seeing some decent pain.</p>
</details>

标普500指数在盘前已经下跌了0.37%，目前位于667点，跌破了670点。昨天我们还相对强势地守住了670点，收盘时也确实在670点，但今天在盘前就失守了。所以开盘后，我们要看是否能继续守住这个位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P 500 already down.37% in the pre-markets. We're at 667. So we lost 670. We were holding 670 relatively strong yesterday. We did close at 670, but today we lose it in the pre-markets. And so when the market opens, we're going to see if we can continue to hold it.</p>
</details>

Robinhood 下跌了2%，昨天在公布了公司有史以来最好的财报之一后，股价却下跌了11%。特斯拉方面，埃隆·马斯克确实拿到了他的薪酬方案，我们稍后会详细讨论，但特斯拉目前下跌了约1.4%。OpenDoor 在财报后暴跌23%。Take-Two Interactive 公司的《侠盗猎车手》推迟到2026年11月发布，股价下跌4%。MP Materials 下跌4%。英伟达股价回落至184美元，跌破185美元，跌幅3%。Oklo 下跌6%，距离跌破100美元仅差35美分。Rocket Lab 股价47美元，下跌3%。SoFi 股价26.68美元，下跌2%。情况大致如此。BMR 下跌1%，Iren 下跌3%，尽管其财报不错。Meta 再度下跌1%。今天真是糟糕的一天，非常非常糟糕。因此，你正在目睹这种糟糕局面带来的痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood down 2% was down 11% yesterday after one of the best earnings that the company's ever put up. Tesla, Elon Musk did get paid. We'll talk a little bit more about the Tesla compensation package, but Tesla right now is down about 1.4%. Open Door down 23% on the day after their earnings. Take two. Grand Theft Auto is delayed until November 2026. That one's down 4%. MP Materials is down 4%. Nvidia 184 back below 185. Nvidia is down 3%. Oaklows down 6% 35 cents away from going below 100. Rocket Lab 47 down 3%. SoFi 2668 down 2%. You kind of see the picture. BMR down 1%. I ran down 3% even though I ran out of good earnings. Meta down another 1%. It's an ugly day. It's an ugly ugly ugly day. And as a result you are seeing the pain of that ugliness.</p>
</details>

### 市场下跌的核心原因：劳动力市场疲软与动量回调

那么问题来了，我们为什么会经历这样的痛苦？显然，昨天并没有一个标志性的头条新闻能让所有人指着说：“嘿，这就是市场如此痛苦的首要原因，这就是一片红海的首要原因。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the question then becomes and and we'll kind of get started with this. Why are we having that type of pain? And obviously yesterday I don't think there was that sort of signature headline that everyone can point to to be able to say, "Hey, this is the number one reason why there's so much pain. This is the number one reason why there's so much red."</p>
</details>

我得出的结论是，第一，这与劳动力市场有关。我们确实有关于劳动力市场的更多更新，特别是失业救济申请数据，这些数据进一步证实了我们正处于一个疲软的劳动力市场。我们稍后会看一下。第二，我认为我们正处于一个动量回调期，市场正在进行一轮洗盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've come to a conclusion that number one, it's about the labor market. We do have some more updates about the labor market in terms of jobless claims, which which sort of continue to further make the argument that we are in a weak labor market. So we'll look at that in a second. Number two, I think we're in a momentum draw down with the flushing out that's happening in front of us.</p>
</details>

我认为今天这轮洗盘中，我唯一担心，也是我们所有人都应该关注的是，我们能否止住这轮下跌？这是最重要的事情。我们能止血吗？我甚至不认为我们需要一个绿色的反转，也不需要股票回到它们的200日移动平均线。我们只需要看到某种形式的底部正在形成。因为坦白说，我认为人们如此烦躁的原因是，你不知道底部在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that flushing out event today, the only concern that I have and I think the only thing that all of us should be looking out for is hey, can we stop the bleeding? That's the number one thing. Can we stop the bleeding? I don't I'm not even I I I don't we don't need a green reversal. We don't need stocks to go back to their 200 day move moving average. We just need to see some form of a bottom that is being formed because right now, quite frankly, I think the reason people are so annoyed is because you don't know where the bottom is.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么昨天任何试图抄底的买家都没有成功的原因。如果你在 Robinhood 从140美元跌到129美元时抄底，现在它已经跌到124美元了，对吧？这又是一个3-4%的下跌，非常令人烦恼。所以问题就变成了，我们有没有办法观察到市场何时停止下跌，稳定在某个位置，然后至少有机会开始回升。我不知道 Grab 为什么在盘前上涨了2%，因为所有股票都在下跌，但 Grab 确实涨了一点。Expedia 的财报不错，上涨了14%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why any dip buyers that took a chance at the dip yesterday, it hasn't worked because you know if you bought the dip of Robin at 129 after it fell from 140, now it's at 124, right? So it's like another 3 4% dip. And that gets very annoying. And so the the question then becomes, is there a way for us to see when things kind of stall, stay in one place, and then start to at least have a chance to move higher. I don't know how Grab's up 2% in the pre-markets because everything's red, but Grab's up a little bit. Expedia did have good earnings. That's up 14%.</p>
</details>

还是说今天市场会彻底崩盘，继续下跌？更不用说今天是星期五了。这很有趣，因为在世界上其他任何地方、任何行业、任何工作中，星期五都意味着“哦，星期五了，一周结束了，我准备好去玩了。”但在股市里，星期五通常会下跌，因为没人想持股过周末。华尔街的机构，尤其是做市商，往往会在周五抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or does the bottom fall out today and do we continue going red? Not to mention it's a Friday and it's so funny because Fridays in every other like part of the world, every other profession, every other job is like, "Oh, it's Friday, end of the week. I'm ready to have fun." In the stock market, usually on Fridays we go red because no one wants to no one wants to hold stocks over the weekend and Wall Street institutions, market makers in general, they they tend to dump on Friday.</p>
</details>

所以，你基本上应该预料到每个星期五都会下跌，期权到期，各种事情都会发生。但如果市场整个星期都处于下跌状态，那么在星期五愿意买入股票的人就不会太多。所以，我们今天必须观察，这种下跌动能会被消化多少，如果继续被消化，那么在今天剩下的时间里，情况是否会变得更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, you already should expect red every time we have Friday, options expire. You have a bunch of different stuff happening. But if the market's already been red all week, you know, there's not that many people that tend to want to buy stocks on a Friday. So, it's it's just going to be one of those things we have to see today. How much of that momentum gets flushed out, if that momentum continues to get flushed out and, you know, if this gets a little bit worse as we are getting through the rest of the day.</p>
</details>

### 劳动力市场数据深度解析

这是关于劳动力市场的最新情况。我们确实有一些额外的就业数据，但不是来自劳工统计局（BLS），因为政府仍然关闭。我认为政府停摆也对我们看到的市场下跌有一定影响。理论上，更多的失业救济申请正在增加。同样，由于政府关闭，我们没有官方的失业救济申请数据，这可能导致劳动力市场进一步疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is the update on the labor market. We do have some additional jobs data, not from the BLS because the government is still closed. I think the government shutdown is also contributing to some of the red that we're seeing. But more jobless claims theoretically are going higher. Again, we don't have jobless claims because the government is closed. Uh which could be contributing to another weaker labor labor market.</p>
</details>

我们的数据提供商 Analytics 显示，本周申请人数增加了1万人，总数仍为温和的22.9万。你可以在下一张图表中看到，这个数字正在上升。它处于过去几个月的区间顶部，但并未真正飙升。持续申领失业救济金的人数在不断攀升，再加上我们昨天从 Challenger 报告中看到的大规模裁员激增，这表明未来可能会进一步走弱，值得关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Analytics, our data provider rising by 10,000 on the week. Still a modest 229. You can see that in the next chart. They're rising. It's the top of the range where they've been the past several months, but not really through the roof though. continuing claims that keeps edging higher together with that surge in mass layoffs that we reported yesterday from Challenger. Well, that suggests maybe some further weakening ahead that bears watching.</p>
</details>

与此同时，联邦雇员的持续申领人数也值得关注。这个数字持续飙升，现已超过2.3万人，是自2019年以来的最高水平，这可能反映了政府停摆的一些影响。此外，这也可能是被解雇的联邦雇员开始申请福利的第一波浪潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, the separate count of continuing claims by federal workers. That's worth watching here. It continues to surge now topping 23,000. That's the highest since 2019, reflecting perhaps some impact of the shutdown. Also, the beginning of the wave of laidoff federal workers who would now be eligible for benefits applying for those benefits.</p>
</details>

我们有一系列替代性就业报告，给人的印象是劳动力市场正在降温，但并未崩溃。没有任何指标显示出失控的信号。让我们看看一些显示强劲或稳定的迹象。我们一周前给你的 ADP 初步数据显示，每周平均新增就业岗位为1.4万个。然后全国报告从负2.9万上升到4.2万。昨天我们报道了芝加哥联储对失业率的估计，基本保持在4.3%左右，还有初请失业金人数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have a slew of alternative jobs reports giving an impression of a labor market I would say cooling but not crashing. None of the indicators are giving runaway signals either way. Take a look at the signs of strength or stability. The ADP preliminary data we get we gave you a week ago that's 14,000 average for weekly um uh job gains. And then the national report was up from 20 from minus 29,000 now to 42. We brought you yesterday the Chicago Fed's estimate of the unemployment rate pretty much unchanged around 4.3% and there's that initial claims.</p>
</details>

现在来看看疲软的迹象。Challenger 的裁员报告首当其冲，裁员人数达到15.3万。持续申领失业救济金的人数正逼近区间顶部。Indeed 网站的招聘职位数量虽然高于100的基准线，但一直在持续下降。然后是ISM制造业和服务业的就业指数，这两个指数本周都有所回升，但仍低于50。所以我主观地将它们归为疲软类别。我们正在整合所有这些信息，你可以看到，哦，还有一件事，你可以在我们创建的新网站 cnbc.com/alt/altdata 上阅读我们的报道，美联储正在关注所有这些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now let's look at the signs of weakness. Um challenger job cuts report got to top that list at gaining 153,000 continuing claims edging higher towards the top of the range there. The Indeed jobs posting above the um the the standard of 100 but has been ticking down continuously. And then the ISM manufacturing and service employment indices both of those are had ticked up on the week but they remain below 50. So subjectively I put them into the weakness categories. Uh we're putting all this together folks and you can see oh one more thing we have uh yeah you can read our coverage of at a new site that we created cnbc.com alt/altt data the Fed looking at all this data.</p>
</details>

正如你所见，替代性就业申请数据显示，上个月，也就是十月份，又新增了1万份申请。这并不是什么好消息。所以，那种认为我们十二月不会降息的想法，我认为是绝对荒谬的。我们看到了足够多的数据来支持降息的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as you can see, alternative jobs claims suggesting that uh we have another 10,000 of claims that hit the tape this month or this uh yeah, this month of um October, last month. Um yeah, that's not the best thing. So, I mean, look, this idea that we're not going to get a a cut in December, I think is absolutely rid. We're seeing more than enough data for why we would get a cut.</p>
</details>

昨天的大新闻是，第三方公司 Challenger 的数据显示，十月份私营市场的裁员人数达到了自2003年以来的最高水平。再说一次，我不知道当看到这样的数据时，鲍威尔怎么能不降息。更不用说，有大量头条新闻报道称，我们看到的裁员是由于人工智能（AI）造成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The big news yesterday was that Challenger, which is a third party firm, basically showed that we have had the most number of layoffs in the private market in October since 2003. Again, I don't know how JPAL, this 175,000 doesn't cut when you see data like that. Not to mention, there's, you know, plenty and plenty of headlines of uh the the the labor the layoffs that we are seeing being cited due to to AI.</p>
</details>

事实上，Challenger 的研究报告指出，人工智能是支付服务提供商和雇主表示“嘿，这很可能是我们不需要这么多工作岗位的原因”的核心理由之一。如果情况真是如此，那么我们确实需要在人工智能的背景下思考一些问题，但同时，美联储唯一能做的就是降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, the Challenger study said that AI in particular was one of the core reasons that payment providers and employers said, "Hey, this is likely why we don't need so many jobs." And if that's the case, then, you know, there's something that we do have to think about in the context of AI, but also the only thing the Fed can do is cut rates at that point.</p>
</details>

所以，我们将看看十二月份的情况会如何发展。十二月份降息的概率是70.6%，这实际上比昨天的69.1%有所上升。但我确实认为我们会在十二月份迎来降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, we're going to see how December ends up playing out. The probabilities for December are 70.6. So that's actually up from yesterday at 69.1. But I do think we will be getting that December cut.</p>
</details>

### 美联储降息预期与市场情绪

在恐惧与贪婪指数方面，我们确实处于“极度恐惧”状态，这通常是买入的信号。再说一次，今天我认为抄底并不是一个糟糕的选择，只是我不认为全仓买入是正确的策略。我认为可以小口买入你喜欢的股票，如果它们继续下跌，那就顺其自然吧，对吧？如果你打算长期持有它们，那么你就必须能够承受持续的下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of uh fear and greed, we are indeed in extreme fear, which usually is the signal to buy. Again, today I I I don't think buying this dip is horrible. I just don't think going allin is the right strategy. I think nibbling on your favorite stocks and if they keep dipping, then it is what it is, right? Like you if you want to hold them longterm, then you just have to be able to withstand continued dips.</p>
</details>

但如果你有1万美元准备抄底，或许你可以先动用其中的2000美元，把剩下的80%留到市场更明朗的时候。如果到时你必须以更高的价格买入，那也只能接受。但手头留一些资金准备部署，总比把所有钱都投进市场然后眼睁睁看着它继续下跌要好。所以我们正处于极度恐惧之中，今天我最想看到的就是，我们能否找到任何一个底部来止住这轮下跌？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think if you have like 10,000 and you're ready to buy the dip, you know, maybe you allocate 2,000 out of that 10,000 and save the other 80% of it for when you get more clarity. And if you have to buy higher, then it is what it is. But it's better to have some of that money ready to deploy versus keeping it all in the market and then it just completely continues to go further down. So we are in extreme fear and today the number one thing I want to see is can we find any level of a bottom to stop the bleeding?</p>
</details>

这才是今天真正重要的事情。我们能止血吗？还是说这轮下跌必须继续下去？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's really what matters today. Can we stop the bleeding or does this have to continue?</p>
</details>

### 公司动态：Grab 与 GoTo 的潜在合并传闻

好的，我看到了关于 Grab 的新闻，我想这就是 Grab 股价在此刻转绿的原因。印尼正在讨论网约车和送餐公司 Grab 与其竞争对手 GoTo 之间可能的合并或收购。总统发言人周五表示，“政府认为网约车行业对创造就业至关重要，对经济至关重要。仅 GoTo 的一个部门就有310万在线司机，而 GoTo 和 Grab 多年来一直主导着印尼市场。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I have the Grab news and I guess that is what's creating Grab going green right here. Indonesia is discussing a possible merger or acquisition between ride hailing and food delivery firm Grab and its rival GoTo. The presidential spokesperson said on Friday, "The government considers the ride hailing industry as strategic for job creation and vital to the economy. Goto's unit alone has 3.1 million online riders and Goto and Grab have dominated the Indonesian market for years."</p>
</details>

这很有趣。如果你一直关注 Grab 的故事，就会知道 GoTo 和 Grab 的合并已经讨论了很长时间。几个月前我几乎放弃了，因为它似乎就要不了了之了，GoTo 做自己的事，Grab 也做自己的事。关于他们为什么最终会进行收购，总是有很多火上浇油的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's interesting. So, you know, the the if anyone's kept up with the Grab story, the Goto and Grab merger has been talked about for a long time. I kind of gave up on it um a couple months ago because it just seemed like it was going to die out and you know, Goto was doing their thing, Grabb is doing their thing. There's always a lot of fuel to the fire for why they would end up doing the buyout.</p>
</details>

印尼总统的一位官员直接引述说他们正在研究合并，这有点疯狂。这意味着这可能有些真实性。Grab 在这里上涨了1.6%。我不知道这是否足以让它在普遍下跌的市场中有所作为。它在盘前确实获得了一些动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that a official for the Indonesian president is giving a direct quote that they are looking into a merger is kind of wild. It means that there might be some truth to this uh grab right here up 1.6%. I don't know if that's enough to actually make it move in a sea of red. It is getting some momentum right here in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

听着，如果这真的发生了，我认为对 Grab 来说将是非常有利的。他们有足够的现金来完成这笔交易。我不认为他们需要花光所有的四五十亿现金来完成合并。但如果他们真的收购了 GoTo，你将为平台增加1亿用户。我的意思是，这将极大地加速增长。如果合并真的发生，2026年的增长率将远超30%。所以，我想我们得从长远来看，看这是否会发生。但你有了这个消息，这可能是它在盘前上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, if that happens, I think that would be very accive to grab. They have the cash to get it done. I don't think they have to spend all four, five billion cash they have to get the merger. But if they do take out go uh go to you know, you're adding a 100 million users to the platform. I mean, that would massively accelerate growth. it would be well over 30% in 2026 if that merger does happen. So, I guess we're going to have to see over the long term if that takes place. But you got that news and that's potentially why that's green in the pre-market.</p>
</details>

### 政治风波：特朗普言论与政府停摆危机

好了，让我们来看看其他一些头条新闻。昨天市场非常糟糕，但在这种糟糕的局面中，至少埃隆·马斯克先生拿到了报酬，这让人很高兴。哦，我们看到了一条特朗普的推文。等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, all right, let's get into some of the other headlines that we got. So, again, yesterday was pretty ugly, but in the midst of that ugliness, you did have at least Mr. Elon Musk getting paid, which was very nice to see. Oh, we got a Trump tweet. Hold on.</p>
</details>

实际上我们有几条特朗普的推文。第一条，哦，好吧，我们有三条。第一条是：“南希·佩洛西，那个两次弹劾我都失败了的、又老又破的政治骗子，终于要退出了。她在股市里非法发了大财，敲诈美国公众，对美国来说是一场灾难。我很高兴看到南希·佩洛西的臭气散去。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got actually a couple Trump tweets. Uh, number one, oh, we got well, okay, we have three tweets. Number one is, "Nancy Pelosi, the old and broken political hack who impeached me twice and loss is finally calling it quit. She illegally made a fortune in the stock market, ripped off the American public, and was a disaster for America. I'm glad to see the stench of Nancy Pelosi go."</p>
</details>

好的，这是第一条。第二条：“共和党人终止**“冗长辩论”**（Filibuster: 议会中一种拖延议事的策略，通过发表超长演说来阻挠法案表决），带回美国梦。如果你们不这么做，民主党人就会做，而你们将再也无法当选。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, that's number one. Republicans terminate the filibuster and bring back the American dream. If you don't do it, the Dems will, and you'll never see office again.</p>
</details>

这是第二条。第三条是：“直接说不。终止‘冗长辩论’。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's number two. And number three, just say no. Terminate the filibuster. Okay, that's what you got.</p>
</details>

听着，我真心希望我们能结束这次政府停摆。过去几天，有很多参议员在CNBC的节目上说：“嘿，我们认为本周末之前可以避免停摆。”离本周末还有几天，所以我想我们将看看停摆是否真的能被避免。但是，如果特朗普说要废除“冗长辩论”，我不知道他是否在鼓励民主党和共和党之间进行谈判以结束停摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, look, I really hope that we can get this shutdown completed. There was a lot of senators that came on the program for CNBC over the past couple of days and they said, "Hey, we think that the shutdown will be avoided by the end of this week." We got a couple days left until the end of this week. So, I guess we're going to see if the shutdown actually does get avoided. But, I mean, if Trump is saying to get rid of the filibuster, I don't know if he's necessarily encouraging negotiation between uh the Democrats and Republicans to end the shutdown.</p>
</details>

现在已经40天了，这是历史上最长的一次政府停摆。我认为这也影响了市场。我认为这显然也影响了市场，因为市场开始意识到，如果我们无法解决这个问题，将会有很多人失业。他们没有工作，就没有钱。没有钱，他们显然就无法在商品和服务上消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's now been 40 days, the longest shutdown in history. And I think this is also affecting the market. I think this is obviously also affecting the market because the market is starting to realize that if we can't get this going, you're going to have a lot of people that just don't have a job. They don't have a job. They don't have money. They don't have money. Obviously, they can't spend on goods and services.</p>

### 特斯拉股东大会：马斯克万亿薪酬方案获批与芯片产能瓶颈

埃隆的1万亿美元薪酬方案昨天以超过75%的投票率获得批准。我观看了整个股东大会，和你们很多人一起看的。听着，他为特斯拉描绘了一个非常光明和乐观的未来。我认为如果他能把特斯拉的市值做到8.5万亿美元，他就应该得到那1万亿美元的薪酬。

<p class="english-text">Elon's uh $1 trillion compensation package did get approved yesterday with over 75% of the vote. Uh I watched the entire shareholder meeting. I was watching it with a lot of you guys. And look, he paints a very bright and optimistic picture for Tesla. And I think he deserves the one trillion compensation if he can get Tesla to 8.5 trillion.</p>
</details>

我一直不理解反对这个薪酬方案的理由。如果他能让股价上涨10倍，他会得到很多钱。但投资的人的投资也会上涨10倍。这对我来说显然是个好交易。但它以75%的投票率通过了。我在投票前预测是70对30，所以我感觉会以压倒性优势支持他，结果也确实如此，这很好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I again, I I I've never understood the bare case for the compensation package. Like if he gets the stock to go up 10x, he gets a lot of money. But whoever is invested also in makes their investment go up 10x. Like that's obviously seems like a good deal to me. But um it was approved 75% of the vote. I I I called it 7030 before the vote happened. And so I had a feeling like it would be overwhelming in his favor and it did which is good to see. And that's what you got with Elon.</p>
</details>

昨天埃隆说的最重要的一件事是，他正在考虑建造一个芯片制造厂。听到这个消息有点疯狂，因为他基本上是说，即使我们考虑到供应商芯片生产的最佳情况，我们也没有足够的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the most important thing that Elon said yesterday is that he's thinking of building a chip fab. And this was kind of crazy to hear because basically he was like we don't have enough demand even if we look at the best case for chip production from our suppliers.</p>
</details>

我们如何制造足够的芯片？我非常尊重特斯拉的合作伙伴台积电和三星。也许我们会和英特尔合作。我们还没有签署任何协议，但与英特尔进行讨论可能是值得的。但是，即使我们推断供应商芯片生产的最佳情况，仍然不够。所以我认为我们可能不得不建造一个特斯拉的“Terafab”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How do we make enough chips? Um so uh you know have a lot of respect for our the the Tesla partners TSMC and Samsung. Um yeah, you know, maybe we'll we'll we'll do something with Intel. Uh we we haven't signed any deal, but it's probably worth having discussions with Intel. Uh but um even when we extrapolate the best case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, uh it's still not enough. So I think we may have to do a Tesla Terraab.</p>
</details>

所以，它就像 Giga 工厂，但要大得多。我想不出其他方法来获得我们所需要的大量芯片。所以我认为我们可能将不得不建造一个巨大的芯片工厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's like giga but way bigger. Um, I I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that that we're looking for. Um, so I think we're probably going to have to build a gigantic trip app.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，那不是我的音频问题。昨天特斯拉的音频质量非常糟糕。我不明白为什么他们的音频那么差，但整个直播流的音频，你几乎听不清演讲者在说什么。但基本上，他说需求如此之大，即使在三星和台积电（他们的合作伙伴）能够生产这些芯片的最佳情况下，他们也没有足够的芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, and by the way guys, that's that's not my audio. Tesla's audio yesterday was just horrible. Like, I don't understand why their audio was so bad, but the entire stream for their audio, it's like you could barely hear what the speakers were saying and everything. But basically, he says there is so much demand that even in the best case scenario for uh Samsung and TSMC, which are their partners, to be able to get these chips out, they won't have enough chips.</p>
</details>

他考虑，嘿，他提到了英特尔，也许我们会和英特尔合作，这值得研究。英特尔在他这么说之后股价上涨了4%。其次，他说也许我们必须建造自己的 Giga 工厂。现在，我真的认为埃隆会进入芯片生产领域吗？不，我不会赌他不会，但我只是不会乐观地赌他会。所以我不会说他们不会做，但我绝对不会把钱押在他们会做这件事上，因为这些都是非常困难的事情。建立一个完整的芯片工厂甚至需要5到10年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he's thinking, hey, I mean, he throws out Intel. Maybe we'll do something with Intel. It's worth looking at. Intel was up 4% as soon as he said that. And then second, he said maybe we have to build our own gigaf. Now, do I actually think Elon's going to get into the chip production game? No, I wouldn't bet against it. I just wouldn't be optimistic to bet for it. Uh so I wouldn't say they won't do it, but I definitely wouldn't put money on the line saying they will do it because again, these are very, you know, hard things. It takes 5 to 10 years to even get an entire chip app to be set up.</p>

### AI 算力之争：从马斯克到奥特曼的共同焦虑

但重点是，他所说的话将我们带入了关于 OpenAI 和人工智能市场正在发生的事情的讨论中。OpenAI 的山姆·奥特曼昨天发了一条很长的推文，基本上是在为自己辩护，因为他之前说政府应该为计算领域的联邦贷款提供支持。我们会谈谈政府对此的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the point is what he said kind of takes us into the conversation around open AI and what's going on in the AI space of the market. So open AI Sam Alman had a really long tweet yesterday basically trying to save his ass after saying that the government should backs stop a lot of the federal loans when it comes to compute and uh we'll talk about the response from the government on this.</p>
</details>

但核心问题是，山姆·奥特曼一直在说，计算能力不够，计算能力不够，计算能力不够。我们需要更多的需求，需要数万亿美元来建立所有这些需求。我想我们都理解这个论点，但我们很多人对山姆·奥特曼是说这话的人感到恼火。问题是，这真的吗？发生了什么？我们该如何看待？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at its core Sam Alman has been saying there's not enough compute. There's not enough compute. There's not enough compute. We need way more demand. We need trillions and trillions of dollars to build up all this demand. And I think we all like understand the argument, but a lot of us, you know, are annoyed that Sam Alman is the one saying this. And it's like the question is like, is it actually real? What's happening? How are we thinking about it?</p>
</details>

然后你又看到像埃隆这样的人，他经营的公司也直接受到这种计算能力的影响，那就是 FSD 和机器人技术，而不仅仅是一个大型语言模型，而是我们可以在人工智能的物理实体中看到的东西。他说，即使在最好的情况下，需求也不够。所以，当埃隆说我们需要比我们能想象的更多的芯片和计算能力，而山姆·奥特曼也这么说时，你就有了两个在人工智能领域非常重要的人在说，根本没有足够的供应来满足这种需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you got someone like Elon who, you know, also is operating a company that has two direct implications of this compute, which is FSD and robotics, not just an LLM, but something that, you know, we can see in the physical embodiment of AI. And he's saying there's not enough demand even in the best case scenario. So when you've got Elon saying we need way more chips and compute than we can even imagine and Sam Alman saying that you've got two pretty important people in the world of AI saying that there is simply not enough supply to handle this demand.</p>
</details>

也许这继续证明了为什么**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）将继续走高。我认为过去几周我们看到市场下跌的另一个原因是，人们担心资本支出是否会继续以目前的方式增长，这是一个有点愚蠢的担忧，因为所有**超大规模数据中心**（Hyperscalers: 指拥有超大规模计算基础设施的公司，如亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure）都已经预测2026年的支出将远超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe that continues to make the case for why capex will continue to go higher. I think another reason we've seen this read over the past couple weeks is because there is some concern about is capex going to continue in the way that it's going to continue and that's a bit of a silly concern because all the hyperscalers have already guided for 2026 being well above expectations.</p>
</details>

当然，他们总是可以下调这个预测，但尽管如此，根据我们看到的数据，很难想象资本支出会下降。所以，埃隆只是再次确认了需求充足的论点。如果我之前说错了需求和供应，我的意思是需求充足，供应不足。由于供应不足，他们将如何满足需求？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, they can always take that guy down, but nonetheless, you know, based on the data that we're seeing, it's hard to imagine that capex is going to go down. So, Elon kind of just reconfirming the argument that there is plenty of demand. I if I said demand, I meant if I'm messing up the words demand and supply, I meant to say there is plenty of demand, there's not enough supply, and as a result of there not being enough supply, then how are they going to fulfill the demand?</p>
</details>

如果 FSD、机器人技术和大型语言模型方面的计算需求巨大，就需要有办法来满足它。埃隆甚至合法地建议建造自己的芯片工厂，这正显示出他对获得足够芯片的认真程度。这也向我证明了为什么山姆·奥特曼如此认真地要制造这些芯片。这就是为什么他与 AMD、甲骨文、英伟达、博通有这1.4万亿美元的支出承诺，因为他知道拥有最多计算能力的人才能获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? If there's massive FSD demand, massive robotics demand, massive compute demand in regards to LLMs, there's going to need to be a way to fulfill it. And the fact that Elon's legit suggesting building your own chip just goes to show how serious he is about getting enough chips. And and and it also, I think, proves to me why Sam Alman is so serious to build these chips. And that's why he has these 1.4 trillion spending commitments with AMD, Oracle, Nvidia, Broadcom, because he knows that the person who has the most compute wins.</p>
</details>

这对半导体股票非常利好。但埃隆的言论，实际上是说我们可能需要建立自己的芯片工厂，这为山姆·奥特曼一直在说的一切增添了更多的合法性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very bullish for semiconductor stocks. Um, but it kind of gave a little bit more legitimacy to everything that Sam Alman's been saying given Elon kind of reinforced it by literally saying we might have to build our own chip app.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI 的公关危机与真实意图

昨天，山姆·奥特曼表示，我们不希望政府为 OpenAI 的数据中心提供担保。我们认为政府不应该挑选赢家或输家，纳税人也不应该为做出糟糕商业决策或在市场中失败的公司买单。如果一家公司失败了，其他公司会做好工作。我们认为可能有意义的是政府建立自己的人工智能基础设施，但这样做的收益也应该流向政府。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Sam Alman yesterday, uh, we do not want government guarantees for open AI data centers. We believe that government should not pick winners or losers and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work. What we do think might make sense is government building their own AI infrastructure, but then the upside of that should flow to governments as well.</p>
</details>

所以你看到山姆·奥特曼试图挽救本周发生的公关灾难。这也是我认为市场下跌的另一个原因，因为现在人们在说，等等，政府必须介入来支持所有这些东西，这不一定合适。我认为市场被他的言论吓到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you got Sam Alman trying to save the sort of PR disaster that has happened all week. And that's another reason why I think the markets were down because you know now people are saying wait a second the government has to get involved to backs stop all this stuff like that's not something that is uh necessarily appropriate and you had the markets kind of I think freaked out by him saying that.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，我认为他完全错了，他在撒谎。原因在于，这是一份 OpenAI 一周前提交的文件。看看高亮部分，这是来自 OpenAI 的网站。如果我们向下滚动，AI 服务器生产和 AI 数据中心扩大 AMIC 的覆盖范围将覆盖资本的有效成本，降低早期投资风险，并释放私人资本以帮助缓解瓶颈并加速美国的人工智能建设。通过降低美国制造业扩张的风险来对抗中国，为制造商提供他们快速扩大生产所需的确定性和资本。联邦政府还应部署赠款、成本分摊协议、贷款或贷款担保，以扩大工业基础的能力和弹性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">having said that I think he's completely wrong and he's lying and the reason for that is because here is an openi document that was submitted one week ago and take a look at the part that's highlighted this is from openai's website right here if we scroll down AI server production and AI data centers broadening Coverage of the AMIC will cover the effective cost of capital. D-risk early investment and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US. Counter the PRC by d-risking US manufacturing expansion to provide manufacturers with the certainty and capital they need to scale production quickly. The federal government should also deploy grants, cost sharing agreements, loans or loan guarantees to expand the industrialbased capacity and resilience.</p>
</details>

这是来自 OpenAI 的网站。所以很明显，OpenAI 并不害怕向政府申请贷款。他们只是用一种非常糟糕的方式说了出来，然后他们意识到了自己得到的强烈反对。昨天，人工智能沙皇大卫·萨克斯发推文说，政府绝对不会为建设人工智能数据中心的任何联邦贷款提供支持。这也让山姆·奥特曼不得不公开表示那不是他们的意思来挽回局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is from OpenAI's website. So I mean obviously OpenAI is not uh afraid of asking the government for loans. They just said it in such a horrible way and then they realized the backlash that they got. David Sachs yesterday, the AISAR tweeted that the government will absolutely not backs stop any federal loans when it comes to building out AI data centers. And uh you know that also kind of made the argument that Samman had to kind of save by by publicly saying that's not what they're saying.</p>
</details>

但这正是他们所说的。他们想要，我真的认为 OpenAI 想要确保他们大到不能倒。通过将世界上最大的公司、世界上最大的经济体，比如美国联邦政府，都卷进来，这让他们很难失败，因为如果他们失败了，所有人都会失败。所以从这个角度来看，我认为 OpenAI 会继续努力做他们必须做的事情，而我们都在坐着观察。无论你投资哪家人工智能公司，都可能从 OpenAI 的持续工作中受到一些衍生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that is exactly what they're saying. They they they want they again I I really do think OpenAI wants to make sure that they are too big to fail and by wrapping in the biggest companies in the world by wrapping in the biggest economy in the world like the US federal government it really makes it hard for them to fail because if they fail everybody fails and so from that perspective I think OpenAI is going to keep trying to do what they have to do and we are all sitting and observing and whatever company you're investing in AI probably has some derivative impact from OpenAI as they continue to work.</p>
</details>

说到 OpenAI，山姆·奥特曼昨天在台上还收到了传票，这有点疯狂。但这就是有人冲上台给他送传票的片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of opening eye, Sam Alman also got subpoenaed yesterday on stage, which was kind of crazy. But this is the clip of uh someone rushing on stage to subpoena him conference many years ago that you probably go ahead. Can you take off stage? Wow, getting off to a dramatic start already. Um, welcome conference. There you go. He got served on stage.</p>
</details>

但这确实很疯狂。过去一周我们从 OpenAI 看到的各种事情，无论是新交易，还是他们陷入的这个政府支持贷款的公关事件，都相当疯狂。他昨天说的最重要的事情其实是，他们预计2025年的年化收入将达到200亿美元。这远高于他们之前说的130亿美元，到2030年将达到数千亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it is quite wild. It is quite wild over the past week what we've seen in a variety of things from OpenAI, whether it's new deals, whether it's this government backs stop loan PR thing that they got into. The most important thing he said yesterday is actually that they're guiding for 20 billion of annualized revenue for 2025. So it's well above that 13 billion that they were saying and hundreds of billions by 2030.</p>
</details>

再说一次，如果他们真的要在2030年前实现几千亿美元的收入，那么未来八年1.4万亿美元的支出承诺似乎也没那么疯狂了。问题是，他们真的能增长到那个水平吗？如果可以，这对英伟达非常利好，因为他们需要大量的芯片来实现这一点。对 AMD、博通、甲骨文也非常利好，所有这些因与 OpenAI 合作而市值大幅增加的公司，如果 OpenAI 真的能在2030年前增长到数千亿美元，对它们来说都是超级利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, if they're going to actually do a couple hundred billion by 2030, the 1.4 trillion spending commitment over the next eight years doesn't seem that crazy. The question is, can they actually grow to that level? And if they can, it's very bullish Nvidia uh because they're going to need a lot of chips to do that. very bullish AMD, very bullish Broadcom, Oracle, like all those names that got this massive level of market cap increase because of partnering with OpenAI if OpenAI can actually grow to hundreds of billions by 2030. Super bullish for all those names.</p>
</details>

而且，我们很可能会看到整个半导体生态系统的发展势头。最大的问题是他们能否做到这一点？但考虑到特斯拉都想建自己的芯片厂，你显然可以理解山姆·奥特曼做出所有这些承诺的原因，因为他知道计算能力是瓶颈。当然，电力也是实现这一切的瓶颈。但如果他真的做到了，那么我们在人工智能方面可能会看到更多的发展势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, we likely see momentum across the entire semiconductor ecosystem. The biggest question is can they do that? But given that Tesla wants to build their own chip fab, you can obviously sense the reason Sam Alman is making all these commitments is because he knows compute is the bottleneck. Power is also the bottleneck obviously to make this happen. Uh but if he does make this happen, you know, then we probably see some more momentum when it comes to AI.</p>

### 美国政府停摆的连锁反应：航空业首当其冲

关于政府停摆，让我们来更新一下美国主要机场航班被取消的情况。这是美国航空公司首席执行官就这次政府停摆发表的讲话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh government shutdown. Let's get an update right here on the flights that have been shut down in major US airports. Here's the American Airlines CEO speaking on what's going on based on this government shutdown.</p>
</details>

从九个航班减少到八个航班，或者从达拉斯-沃斯堡到达科珀斯克里斯蒂的航班从七个减少到六个。现在就是这类情况。这种取消的程度会随着时间的推移而增加，你知道，这将是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Nine flights to eight flights or DFW to Corpus Christi from seven flights to six flights. It's that kind of stuff right now. Now, this level of cancellation is going to grow over time and you know that's something that is is going to be problematic</p>
</details>

我们稍后会谈到这一点。但我想问一下今天被取消的这些航班。这可能意味着有1万名乘客需要重新安排他们的旅行计划。重新预订他们有困难吗？因为系统里没有太多空余。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and we'll talk about that in a bit. But I want to ask about these flights that were cancelled today. That might be maybe 10,000 people who have to redo their their travel schedules. Any issues rebooking them because there's not a lot of slack in the system.</p>
</details>

系统里确实没有太多空余，但目前我们的客户不会有问题。我们会确保他们在到达机场前很早就知道他们的旅行计划是否被打乱。这只占我们每天65万客户总数中很小的一部分。无论如何，我们都会确保我们的客户得到妥善照顾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There's not a lot of slack in the system, but right now our customers are going to be fine. We're making sure that they know well in advance of getting to the airport if their travel plans have been disrupted. And it's a very small portion of the total 650,000 customers that we have in a given day. We're going to make sure that our customers are taken care of no matter what.</p>
</details>

我想说，安全是第一位的。所以我赞扬我们所有的空中交通管制员和运输安全管理局（TSA）的特工。最终，贝德福德局长正在做正确的事情，试图解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Phil, I just want to say safety is the priority. So I give I commend all of our air traffic controllers, TSA agents at the end of the day and administrator Bedford's doing the right thing by trying to get in front of this problem.</p>
</details>

但你有多担心？看，现在全国天气都很好。天佑我们，万一有一场大风暴席卷东南部或东北部或任何地方。试图处理这种情况以及随之而来的航班取消会有多令人沮丧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But how worried are you? Look, we've got good weather around the country right now. God forbid we have a bad storm roll through the Southeast or the Northeast or anywhere. How how frustrating will it be to try to handle that and the cancellations that go with that?</p>
</details>

让政府重新开放。这是第一个关键。我们现在不需要有这个问题，但我们要确保安全是首要任务，我们会处理风暴和其他事情。但你说得对，随着这个问题越来越严重，航班取消越来越多，系统里没有太多余地，管理航空公司和整个行业会变得越来越困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Let's get the government back open. That's the the first key. We don't need to have this problem right now, but we're going to make sure that safety is priority and we will handle storms and other things. But you're right, as this problem grows and as cancellations grows, there's not a lot of slack in the system and managing the airline, managing the industry becomes exponentially harder as you increase the level of cancellations.</p>
</details>

谈谈这个，因为这不仅仅是你取消从这里到那里的航班那么简单。飞机需要停放，机组人员需要重新安排路线。这是目前除了乘客之外最大的挑战吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Talk about that because this is not simply you're not doing this flight from here to there. >> Aircraft have to be parked, crews have to be rerouted. Is that the biggest challenge at this point separate from the passengers?</p>
</details>

我们所处的环境极其复杂。所以无论是需要维护的飞机，还是必须保持飞行资格的飞行员，还有我们的机组人员，对吧，当你今天取消一个航班时，他们不能简单地从上次中断的地方继续。他们必须被完全重新安排。所以所有这些都只会增加复杂性，让事情变得越来越难。我们的客户不应该处理这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's it's an incredibly complex environment that we deal in. And so whether it's planes that need to be maintained, our pilots that have to maintain currency, you know, our crews, right, when you cancel a flight today, right, they don't just simply pick up where they left off. They have to be totally uh rearranged. So all of this is is it just creates complexity that makes it harder and harder. And our customers shouldn't be dealing with this.</p>
</details>

我们现在在我们的综合运营中心，我们不应该处理所有这些复杂性和正在进行的返工。这是我们必须让政府重新开放的事情。

</details>

我们正在尽一切努力确保我们的客户知道，当我们进入一年中最繁忙的旅行季节时，这是我们绝对不能让它发生的事情。菲尔，对此我很有信心，政府里的每个人都明白航空业对整体经济的重要性。每11个工作岗位中就有一个与旅行、旅游和酒店业有某种关系。我们不能把一个更大更广的群体卷入我们今天所处的这种境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, we're doing everything we can to make sure our customers know that as we get into the busiest travel, you know, part of the the year, this is something that we just can't let happen. And Phil on that I'm confident that you know everybody in the government understands how important aviation is to the overall economy. You know one in every 11 jobs is somehow related to travel and tourism hospitality. We can't bring you know a bigger wider group into this you know situation that we find ourselves in today.</p>
</details>

再次重申这一点，今天整个系统取消的航班占3%，前40大市场占4%，但这个数字还会上升。当取消率接近10%时，管理起来会变得多棘手？如果下周末我们达到这个水平，会对整个行业造成什么样的压力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just to reiterate this point at the beginning it's 3% of the flights for the system overall today 4% to the top 40 markets but it goes up from here. How tricky does that become to manage as it goes up close to 10% cancellations? And if we're there by the end of next week, what kind of stress does that put on the industry overall?</p>
</details>

我们没有取消任何飞往较小市场的服务。我们确保在这些地方保持业务。今天，我提到我们可以通过减少航班频率来处理这4%的取消，但接下来会变得困难得多。你将不得不真正深入到一些客流量更大的地区。当取消率达到10%时，说实话，10%是个大数字。

And on that, as you get to 10%, let's face it, it's 10%'s a big number.</p>

所以我只能想象那些为了度假或探亲而旅行的人。我有一个表亲很快要从加利福尼亚来新泽西。这是一种会让人感到更多恐惧的事情，特别是如果这些航班开始以更严重的方式被取消。正如你现在所看到的，美国航空公司的首席执行官说，目前取消的航班像是从波士顿到纽约，这些只有40到50分钟的航程，在三州地区内。而不是像从洛杉矶到纽约，或者从伦敦到迪拜那样的长途航班。

<p class="english-text">And so I could only imagine people that are traveling for vacation or to see family. I have a cousin that's coming from California soon to New Jersey. Like it it's one of those things where there is a little bit more fear going on especially if these flights start to get more can start to get cancelled in a more egregious way. And as you can see right now the American Airlines CEO said right now it's like flights from um you know Boston to New York right things that are like 40 50 minutes like in interest in in the tri-state area. It's not something that's like from LA to New York or or anything like that or like London to Dubai.</p>

但随着越来越多的人不上班，这种情况最终会开始升温。他说每11个工作岗位中就有一个直接或间接受到旅行的影响。是的，旅行是经济的重要组成部分，所以你肯定会看到航空公司股票下跌。最终，我们将看看这种情况是否会持续，或者在今天剩下的时间里，这种下跌是否会停止。

<p class="english-text">But that is going to eventually start heating up as more and more people don't end up working. And the fact that he said one in out of 11 one out of every 11 jobs is affected directly or indirectly in some way through travel. I mean, yeah, travel is a big part of the economy and so you definitely have the airline stocks getting some red. Ultimately, we're going to see if that can continue or if that bleeding ends up stopping towards the rest of the day.</p>

### 财报季焦点：OpenDoor 的争议与 Robinhood 的联动

让我们来谈谈昨天的一些财报。许多动量股公布了财报。OpenDoor 是其中之一，股价下跌了16%。OpenDoor 通过股息引入了一种直接发行，而股息与认股权证挂钩。我不太清楚这具体意味着什么，我正在努力阅读和理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh let's talk about some of the earnings that we had yesterday. So, a bunch of these momentum names had earnings. Open was one of the names that had earnings. Open door right there down 16%. Openoro introduced a direct offering via dividends. Uh and the dividends are tied to warrants. I don't know exactly what this means. I'm trying to read and understand it.</p>
</details>

基本上，这是一种认股权证股息，类似于 GameStop 不久前做的那种。他们每30股配发一份认股权证。根据系列的不同，行权价有多个，分别为9美元、13美元和17美元。这两种都是未来潜在稀释的形式。它们目前不具稀释性，因为可以重新分配。但由于没有发行新股，未来可能会被稀释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, essentially it's a warrant dividend similar to the one GameStop did a while ago. And they're doing one warrant, one warrant per 30 shares. The multiple strikes for them at 913 and 17 depending on the series. And they're both forms of potential future dilution. They're not dilutive at the moment because they can be redistributed. But because no shares are issued, uh, they can be diluted in the future.</p>
</details>

这看起来是利好，因为 OpenDoor 可以筹集资金，而股东则获得认股权证，可以行使以获得更多对标的资产的敞口。但我并不完全理解这到底是什么，但这是他们昨天筹集资金的更具创意的方式之一。尽管如此，他们的每股收益（EPS）未达预期71%，结果，当你业绩如此糟糕时，情况可能会变得非常难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems bullish because Open Door gets to raise capital. open door right here down 16% and shareholders get a warrant to exercise to be able to get more exposure to the underlying but I don't fully understand exactly what it is but it is one of the more I guess you could call creative ways that they engaged in uh in in raising capital yesterday nonetheless they missed on EPS by 71% and as a result you know when you miss that badly things can get pretty ugly.</p>
</details>

昨天有点疯狂的是，OpenDoor 的电话会议是以视频形式进行的，这很好。我真的很喜欢公司开始接受这种方式。你有一个视频会议，甚至 Robinhood 的 Vlad 也打来电话。看看这个视频，我今天早上刚看到的。Robinhood 的 CEO 向 OpenDoor 提了一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now um the thing that was kind of crazy yesterday is that Open Door did have their uh call in in in video which was nice to see. I really like that companies are starting to embrace this stuff and um you had a video call where even Vlad called in from Robin Hood. So take a look at this video. I just saw this this morning. Uh Robin Hood CEO asked a question to Open Door.</p>
</details>

Cass，你好吗？顺便说一句，我们非常激动你们能在 Robinhood 上向散户直播。我想大家心里都有一个问题，那就是代币化进展如何？它有多真实？你认为它将如何彻底改变房屋所有权体验？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What's up Cass? By the way, we're super pumped that you guys are streaming live to retail on Robin Hood. I think the question on everyone's mind is what's going on with tokenization? How real is it? And how do you think it could revolutionize the home ownership experience?</p>
</details>

谢谢，Vlad。感谢你主持我们的节目。听着，我是 Robinhood 的忠实粉丝，我希望我们能继续合作。我们在 OpenDoor 的使命是让世界向房主以及那些努力成为房主的人倾斜。我喜欢 Robinhood 也在做类似的事情。你知道，就是把权力从那些花哨的人手中夺走，交给普通人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Thanks, Vlad. Thanks for hosting us. Um, look, I'm such a big fan of Robin Hood and I hope that we can continue to do things together. Our mission at Open Door is to tilt the world towards homeowners and those working hard to become homeowners. And I love that Robin Hood does some of the same things. You know, this whole thing of taking power away from fancy people and giving to average person.</p>
</details>

现在回答你的问题，我有一个习惯，就是不在产品发布前宣布它们。这是因为我构建的是产品，而不是电子表格。我认为在我们谈论它们之前，我们应该先把东西做出来。我不想说我们下周就会做这个，但我真的无法想象一个房地产没有被代币化的未来。我也无法想象一个 OpenDoor 不在房地产领域引领创新的未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh now to answer your question, um look, I have a habit of of not announcing products before they're launched. That's because I build products, not spreadsheets. And I think it's important that we ship things before we talk about them. And I don't want to say we're going to do this next week, but I genuinely can't imagine a future where real estate's not tokenized. And I also can't imagine a future where Open Door isn't leading innovation in uh real estate.</p>
</details>

听着，我不知道这是否意味着 Robinhood 和 OpenDoor 会有任何有意义的合作。但这确实看起来有点意思，OpenDoor 的 CEO，我开始越来越喜欢他了，就他的沟通能力而言。商业模式本身，我并不喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, now look, I don't know if uh if if that means Robin and Open going to collaborate in any meaningful way. Uh, but it does seem kind of interesting that the open door CEO, which I I am starting to like a lot more just in terms of his ability to communicate. The business model itself, I'm not a fan of.</p>
</details>

电话会议上有一些危险信号。很多人在分析后告诉我，每次他被问到关于低价买房然后高价卖出的问题时，他最终都会谈论软件和编码。他开始诗意地谈论我们交付产品的本质。就好像，兄弟，你必须低价买房，高价卖出，并保持中间的差价。对于如何以任何有意义的方式做到这一点来增加利润，没有真正的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I, you know, there were some red flags on the call. I had a lot of people that after they analyzed and they were just like every time he got asked the question about buying homes low and then selling high, he ended up talking about software and coding. And, you know, he started waxing poetic about the the nature of how we ship products. It's like, bro, you have to buy homes low, sell them high, and keep a spread in the middle. Like, and there was no real answer on how they're going to do that in any meaningful way to increase the profit.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么我认为这个商业模式从根本上说就不是一个好生意。有很多其他生意我会选择，它们更容易理解，也没有那种风险。尽管如此，如果他们引入了代币化元素，也许有办法对业务进行转型。但我不知道。我认为股票下跌17%的原因是，华尔街觉得，“伙计，你昨天谈论的所有东西，目前都还不是真的。也许那是一个未来的愿景，但从核心来看，你们在这些房子上根本没赚钱。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is why I think the business model fundamentally is just not a good business. Like, there's a lot of other businesses I would buy over that that are just easier to understand and don't have that type of risk. Nonetheless, if they bring a tokenization component into it, maybe there's a way to kind of pivot the business. But, I don't know. And I think the reason the stock's down 17% right here is because the street's like, "Dude, like all that stuff you talked about yesterday, none of it's real yet. And maybe that's a future vision, but at its core, you guys aren't making any money on these homes."</p>
</details>

所以，我们得从长远来看这会如何发展。也许会有一些与 Robinhood 的合作。如果真的有合作，我认为对 Robinhood 更有利，因为如果 OpenDoor 允许他们将所有房屋代币化，他们就能获得更多的供应。我不太清楚 OpenDoor 如何从中真正受益，因为他们不是支付服务提供商，也不是经纪公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, we're going to have to see longterm how that plays out. Maybe there's some Robin Hood partnership. If there is a Robin Hood partnership, I think it would be better for Robin Hood because they just get access to more supply if Open Door allows them to tokenize all their homes. I don't know exactly how Open Door really benefits from all that because they're not like a payments provider. They're not a brokerage.</p>
</details>

他们通过出售房屋和中间的差价赚钱。而且，他们是自己买房，所以必须以稍高的价格卖出。所以我不知道这具体会如何运作，但尽管如此，昨天的电话会议还是很高兴看到的。OpenDoor 在这里下跌了约16%。Robinhood 也下跌了约2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they they make money off the selling of the home and the spread in between. And again, they buy the home themselves, so they have to sell it for a bit higher. So I don't know exactly how it would work out, but nonetheless, it was nice to see the call yesterday. Open door right there down about 16%. Robin Hood as well down about 2%.</p>
</details>

US AR 的财报不是最好的，下跌了6%。很多稀土股都受到了冲击。Archer 下跌了13%。Archer 的收入为零。华尔街预期是40万美元，他们一分钱没赚。所以，我敢肯定你们很多人每周赚的钱都比 Archer 一个季度赚的要多，但尽管如此，Archer 在这里下跌了13%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">US AR not the best earnings. They were down 6%. A lot of these rare earth stocks getting hit. Archer down 13%. Archer made zero dollars of revenue. The street expected 400,000. They made zero. Um, so I'm sure a lot of you guys are making more money per week than Archer is making per quarter, but nonetheless, Archer right here down 13%.</p>
</details>

再说一次，Archer，这是一个你必须相信其潜力的公司，如果你要投资它。而现在，有很大潜力的股票并没有得到太多青睐。Absci，我今天和 Arie 谈过这个。潜力很大。他们下跌10%的原因是，他们的执行力并不是最高水平，因为他们的平台需要时间来发现能够有效发挥作用的药物。所以很多那些受到追捧的动量股，比如 Oklo，也下跌了6%。在英伟达也下跌2%的这一天，它们都受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, Archer, it's one of those names that you have to believe in the potential of Archer if you're buying into it. And right now, stocks with a lot of potential are not really getting that much love. Absela, I was talking to Arie about this today. A lot of potential. The reason they're down 10% is because they're not really executing at the highest of levels because it takes time for their platform to find drug discovery that can meaningfully work. So a lot of those momentum driven names that got a bid like an Oaklo as well down 6%. They are getting hit on a day when Nvidia as well is getting hit by 2%.</p>
</details>

这就是现在的情况。美联储今天下午3点将举行紧急会议。这真的会发生吗？美联储将举行紧急会议。美联储可能已经准备好他们的会议了。已经有很多关于美联储的讨论。特朗普将在11点45分与匈牙利总理共进午餐。然后他今天下午3点30分返回海湖庄园。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's what you've got going on. Uh the Fed to host an urgent meeting at 3 p.m. today. Is that actually happening? The Fed to host an urgent meeting.

Uh, and then he's going back to Mara Lago at 3:30 today.</p>
</details>

所以，特朗普今天上午的日程并不紧张。我不认为美联储会进行任何紧急降息。我确实看到，是的，美联储今天下午3点会发表讲话，但我不认为那是什么大规模的会议，会说我们要降息。我的意思是，市场还没那么糟糕，不至于需要他们进行疯狂的降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, not a crazy schedule for Trump this morning. Uh, I don't think the Fed is going to do any emergency rate cuts.

I mean, the market's not that bad yet for for for them to get a crazy rate cut.</p>
</details>

特朗普传媒确实公布了财报。没错。DJT，DJT 在这里下跌了1.73%。关于特朗普传媒的财报，我们有5480万美元的净亏损。他们有31亿美元的资产，2870万美元的总收入来自与比特币挂钩的期权费和利息。积极的 SPAC 诉讼解决方案可能会提振未来的业绩。这只股票的市值为40亿美元，他们亏损了5400万美元。看起来他们没有任何收入。如果有的话，也就几百万美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh Trump Media did report earnings. That is correct. DJT, uh DJT right here is down 1.73%. On Trump Media earnings, we have a net loss of 54.8 million. They have 3.1 billion in assets, 28.7 in total income from Bitcoin linked option premiums and interest. Positive spa litigation resolution could be boost future results. This stock has a market cap of 4 billion and they lost $54 million. It doesn't really look like they have any revenue. If anything, it's about a couple million dollars.</p>

### 市场观点：现在是抄底时机吗？

你会在这个价位卖出英伟达吗？绝对不会。关于卖出，我们昨晚讨论过。我的意思是，你必须问自己，你长期看好这些股票的整体论点中，是否有任何根本性的东西被打破了，以至于你要考虑卖出？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mint. Would you sell Nvidia at these levels? Absolutely not. So like when it comes down to selling, we were talking about this last night. I mean, again, you have to ask yourself, is there something that has fundamentally broken in the broader thesis for why you're long any of these names to get into the idea of selling?</p>
</details>

我不知道，听着，我知道看到我们正在经历的所有痛苦和血腥，真的很烦人。但重要的是要提醒自己，我们自十月份以来是上涨的。十月份，我们还在640点。现在，我们在667点。所以，我知道现在不是690点或7000点，但要那么容易达到7000点，从来都不是那么简单的。总会有一些起伏才能到达那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I don't know, look, I know it's really annoying seeing all the pain that we're seeing, all the blood that we're seeing. It is important to remind ourselves that we are up since October. October, we were at 640. Right now, we're at 667. So, I know it's not at 690 or 7,000, but um getting to 7,000 that easily, you know, was never going to be that easy. There's always going to be some ups and downs to get there,</p>
</details>

但从根本上说，对于我认为我们大多数人持有的很多股票的论点，并没有太多东西被打破。现在，如果你持有的是超高动量的股票，Robinhood 算是高动量，但不如 Oklo 那么高，尽管如此，这些股票都会经历回调，因为它们相对于市场有一个贝塔系数，即使在它们公布了惊人的财报之后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh fundamentally not many things have broken in regards to the thesis for a lot of the names that I think most of us are in. Now, if you're in super super high momentum names uh which Robinet is high momentum, it's not as high momentum as Oaklow, but nonetheless, those are going to experience draw downs because they trade at a beta to the market even after they put up phenomenal earnings.</p>
</details>

如果整个市场都在下跌，这是否意味着你现在就该卖掉 Robinhood？我不这么认为。我也不认为这意味着你应该冲进去抄底。你知道，如果你的 Robinhood 平均成本是50美元，你真的会在125美元这里卖掉吗？还是说你会继续持有，即使它跌回110美元？但你会在124美元买入吗？也许不会，因为它可能不会轻易回到150美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the entire market's going down, does that mean you sell Robin Hood here? I I I don't think so. Like I I also don't don't think that means you go and rush to buy the dip. You know, if your average on Robin Hood is 50, do you really sell at 125 right here or do you kind of just hold on even if it goes back down to 110? But do you buy at 124? Maybe not because maybe it's not easily going back to 150.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是一个你只需要按兵不动、静观其变的市场，而不是急于抄底。我们这周已经看到，市场并没有奖励抄底行为。在今年大部分时间里，市场都会立即奖励抄底，几乎是瞬间，在几个小时内，如果你抄底，你就会得到回报。这周这种情况没有发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's a market where you just kind of hold your horses and lay back and see how this thing plays out versus get super excited to buy the dip. We've seen this week that the market has not rewarded buying a dip. Throughout the year, the market has rewarded buying the dip immediately, like almost instantaneously within, forget a day, a couple hours, if you buy the dip, you're rewarded. That has not happened this week.</p>
</details>

如果这种情况在未来几周持续下去，我不是说一定会，只是一个没人知道的问题，那么显然抄底在这里不会是最好的策略。你可能只想坐下来观望。考虑到我们很多人在过去一年里都在抄底，这就引出了一个问题，你还需要抄多少底，除非你真的非常想建立一个你一直没有机会建立的仓位，而且价格变得足够有吸引力让你最终入手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if that continues over the next couple of weeks, which I'm not saying it has to, it's just a question of like no one knows, right? Then obviously buying the dip would not be the best strategy right here. you might just want to sit back and you know given so much of so many of us have bought the dip for the past year it begs the question of how much more of a dip do you need to buy unless you really really want to build up a position in a name that you haven't had a chance to build up on and the price gets attractive enough for you to finally get it.</p>
</details>

如果不是这样，到年底了，如果你已经九个月或十一个月没有抄底了，那只能说明你的配置不足。我敢肯定我们大多数人都已经把钱投入了市场，而且今年我们仍然有不错的涨幅，尽管过去几天有所回调。所以我认为这是你需要问自己的一个更广泛的问题，如果你认为抄底有意义的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if not towards the end of the year if you haven't bought the dip for nine months or 11 months at this point like that that just means you're underallocated and I'm sure most of us have put money into the markets and we're still up for the year a decent chunk even though uh there's been a draw down over the past couple of So I think that is the broader question to ask yourself if you think it's you know making sense to buy dip.</p>
</details>

你对 Meta 怎么看？我们昨天谈过 Meta。再说一次，我宁愿给自己一个季度的时间，看看扎克伯格在所有这些支出上做了什么。我确实认为 Meta 很便宜。我认为如果你在612美元买入 Meta，五年后你不会对此感到失望。问题只是，嘿，我们能让这东西跌到550、570美元的区间，让它变得真正有吸引力吗？而不是在612美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think about Meta? We talked about Meta yesterday. Again I would rather give myself a quarter to see what Zux is doing with all the spend. I do think Meta is cheap. I think in 5 years if you buy Met at 612 you are not going to be upset about that. It's just a question of hey can we get this thing into the 550s 570s for it to get really attractive versus at 612.</p>
</details>

在完全投入之前，我只想更多地了解扎克伯格想用所有这些资本支出做什么。但如果 Meta 在这里反转，我不会感到惊讶。问题是，如果我们正在经历宏观层面的回调，对于一个目前叙事不佳的人工智能股票来说，要实现反转会有点困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would just like to know more about what Zux is trying to do with all this capex spend before fully jumping in. But it would not surprise me if Meta reverses here. The question is if we're having a macro draw down, it's going to be a little tough for an AI name with a bad narrative on it right now to reverse.</p>

AppLovin 的**“40法则”**（Rule of 40: 软件行业衡量公司健康状况的指标，即增长率与利润率之和应大于40%）得分是144。天哪，这比 Palantir 和 Robinhood 都高。AppLovin 是我们不常谈论的公司，但这确实令人难以置信。听着，他们的财报很棒。他们面临着美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的调查，我认为这对股票有一点影响，但股票现在是6.13美元，在盘前下跌了约1.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Apploven has a rule of 40 of 144. Dude, that's more than pounder and more than uh Robinet. Apploven is the one that we don't talk about too much, but that is pretty incredible. Look, they had a great earnings. They have that SEC probe that's out there and I think that's a little bit of overhang on the stock but stock right there at 613 down about 1.2% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

关于 Palantir，我昨天看到一件事，感谢 Jack 发布了这个，是 Michael Burry 的**13F报告**（13F Filing: 美国证券交易委员会SEC规定，管理超过1亿美元股权资产的机构投资者每个季度必须披露其持仓情况的报告）。我们昨天稍微谈了一下，但 Michael Burry 在他法定必须公布的两周前就公布了他的13F报告。在过去十年里，他从未这么早公布过。这次是在 Palantir 财报发布时。我认为当你把这两件事联系起来，就明白他为什么这么早公布了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Palanteer. So look, one thing that I saw yesterday, shout out to Jack who posted this was Michael Bur's 13F. We talked a little bit about this yesterday, but Michael Bur posted his 13F uh two weeks early before he actually has to legally post it. And over the past decade, he's never posted it as early as he's posted it. uh which was on pounder earnings. I think when you put two and two together, it makes sense why he posted it so early.</p>
</details>

他显然在 Palantir 和英伟达的看跌期权上亏损严重，他想通过让人们知道他对这些公司进行了十亿美元的做空来向市场发出信号。结果，这就是为什么，对不起，我得开免打扰模式。这就是为什么我认为他提前披露了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was obviously underwater on the pounder and video puts by a large margin and he wanted to give a signal to the market by letting people know that he is putting on a billion dollar short on these companies. And as a result, that is why that is why sorry I got to get to do not disturb. That is why um I think he disclosed it early.</p>
</details>

所以我认为他提前披露的原因是为了向市场发出一个信号，让人们知道我做空了这些股票，我认为在某种程度上，他提前披露是为了获得一些退出流动性，因为他在这些头寸上亏损太严重了，无论是英伟达还是 Palantir。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think the reason for him disclosing it early was for him to kind of send a signal to the market that hey it is time to uh let people know that I'm short these names and I think in a sense he essentially disclosed early to try to get some exit liquidity because again he was down so bad on these positions both Nvidia and Palier.</p>
</details>

现在我不知道他是否在盈利，但 Palantir 股价低于17.5美元，如果他在任何高于这个价格的位置做空，他就是盈利的。很可能他没有，因为如果他在夏天，七月、八月、九月的任何时候买入看跌期权，股价都低于那个水平。所以当 Palantir 涨到21美元左右时，他是在亏损的。但如果他是在那之上做的，现在他开始获得一些利润了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I don't know if he's profiting but Palier's below 175 if he shorted at any price above that he is up. Odds are he might not have given if he did the put at any time in the summer, July, August, September, it was below that level. So he was losing as pounder was going up to like 210 at one point. But if he did it above that, now he is starting to get some type of profit.</p>
</details>

所以我认为他提前披露的核心原因是为了向市场发出信号，让人们沉迷于 Michael Burry 做空的头条新闻。当然，问题是，如果你要去做空一只股票或买入看跌期权，你会仅仅为了在十亿美元的看跌期权上赚几百万美元吗？可能不会。你期待的是一次真正的暴跌，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that the sort of core reason for why he disclosed early was to try to set a signal to the market and let people obsess about the headlines of Michael Bur being short. Granted, here's the question, right? If you're gonna go short a name or buy puts on a name, are you gonna do it just to make a couple million dollars on a billion dollar put? Probably not. You're looking for you're looking for like a like a real draw down, right?</p>

就像在2008年，他在整个市场崩溃之前，甚至都没想过要获利了结。而在整个市场崩溃之前，他本可以多次获利。如果你看过那部电影，整个市场必须真正崩溃，他才最终说：“好吧，我应该获利了结一些了。”他是在等 Palantir 跌到3美元左右吗？我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like like in 2008, he had the whole thing collapsed before he even thought of taking a profit. And he could have profited many times before the whole thing collapsed. If you watch the movie, the whole thing had to really hit the fan for him to finally say, "All right, I should take some some profit off the table." Um, is he waiting for Palanteer to go down to like 30 bucks or something? I don't know.</p>
</details>

但这很有趣，因为过去几个月他完全处于亏损状态。最后，他可能终于浮出水面了。问题就变成了，好吧，你是就此退出，说：“好吧，至少我没有受太多伤就逃脱了。”还是你觉得：“不，这就是我一直在等待的时刻。”就像 Citron 一样。我们要等到这东西真正跌下来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But it is interesting because he was completely underwater for the past couple of months. Finally, potentially he might be above water. And the question becomes, all right, do you just get out of it and say, "All right, well, at least I escaped that without too many scars." Or are you like, "No, this is the moment I've been waiting for." Same thing with Citron. We're going to wait till this thing really comes down.</p>
</details>

我不确定。我认为这真的也取决于更广泛的宏观环境。我不认为 Palantir 会轻易地自己下跌，除非宏观环境也下跌。这就是关于你现在持有的任何股票的一件事，无论你的主要头寸是什么，你都不能真正责怪股票本身。你可以责怪整个市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm not sure. And I think it really does depend on the broader macro as well. Like I I don't think pounder easily goes down by itself unless the macro goes goes down. That's the one thing about whatever stock you're into right now, whatever main position you have, you can't really blame the stock itself. You can blame the whole market.</p>
</details>

也许围绕这只股票有一些不同的因素导致它下跌，但整个市场都在下跌。所以，在市场找到一点底部并开始复苏之前，我们不会知道你持有的个股下跌是因为它本身下跌，还是因为宏观环境下跌。而现在，你可以把很多事情归咎于更广泛的宏观环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe there's some different things around the stock that's helping it to go down, but the entire market's down. And so until the market gets a little bit of a bottom and tends to recover, we're not going to know if the individual stock that you're holding is down because it's down or it's down because the macro is down. And right now, you know, you can chalk up a lot of this stuff to the broader macro.</p>

### 英伟达对华销售禁令升级

Jensen 说中国将在人工智能领域击败美国，这在过去几天肯定没有帮助。哦，顺便说一句，我今天早上忘了说，但特朗普政府昨天基本上表示，Jensen 和 AMD 不会向中国出售任何东西。忘了 Blackwell 吧。他们什么都不会卖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen's tweet started this. Well, Jensen saying that China is going to beat the United States in AI. That definitely didn't help over the past couple days. Oh, by the way, I forgot to talk about this morning, but uh Trump administration basically said yesterday Jensen and AMD are not selling anything to China. Forget Blackwell. They're not selling anything.</p>
</details>

所以，美国将宣布禁止向中国销售英伟达的降级版人工智能芯片。这也解释了为什么 Jensen 会抢先发表那些言论，说中国将赢得人工智能竞赛。但昨晚的多份报告称，美国将禁止向中国销售任何有意义的芯片，如 H100、H20 等，这也影响了 AMD。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the US is set to announce a ban on sales of Nvidia scaled down AI chips to China. This also explains why Jensen kind of front ran those comments by saying that China is going to win the AI race. But multiple reports last night said that the US is going to be banning any sale of meaningful chips, H100s, H20s, etc. to China, which also affects AMD.</p>
</details>

这可能就是为什么英伟达和 AMD 今天尤其受到重创的原因。但这显然也影响了整个市场。AMD 股价2.29美元，跌破2.30美元，下跌了3.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's probably why Nvidia and AMD uniquely are getting a decent chunk of pain today. But that's obviously affecting the entire market as well. AMD 229 loses 230 down 3.4%.</p>
</details>

英伟达不需要中国。还记得 Jensen 在 GTC 上展示的数字吗？我同意英伟达不需要那些中国的数字，但我认为 Jensen 心里也清楚，他不能仅仅依靠国内需求来维持派对。否则，他为什么会那么说呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia doesn't need China. Remember the numbers Jensen was showing at GTC? I agree Nvidia doesn't need those China numbers, but I think Jensen also knows in the back of his head he can't just depend on domestic demand to keep the party going. Otherwise, why would he say that, right?</p>
</details>

Jensen，我们实话实说，Jensen 整年都在拍特朗普的马屁。那么他为什么会公开……他知道当他公开说些什么时，他肯定知道，回想一下三月份量子股发生的事情。他知道当他公开说些什么时，会产生影响。他为什么要说一些有损美国技术的话？他想向大人物发出信号。他为什么要发出信号？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen has, you know, Jensen is let's just let's just call a spade a spade. Jensen has been kissing Trump's ass for the entire year. So why would he public like he knows when he says something publicly he definitely knows when you look back to what happened with the quantum stocks back in March. He knows when he says something publicly it has an impact. Why would he say something that undermines uh American technology? He wants to send a signal to the big guy. And why does he want to send a signal?</p>
</details>

他可能想发出信号的原因是，他知道他需要中国来维持他的业务。也许不是现在，但最终会需要。我认为市场在 Jensen 说了关于中国的那些话之后，也有点害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the reason he might want to send a signal is because he knows that uh he needs China to keep his business afloat. Maybe not now, but eventually. And I think the market's also a little bit, you know, scared of that as well after Jensen said what he said about China.</p>
</details>

那不是我说的。我说的是，中国有非常优秀的人工智能技术。他们有很多AI研究人员。事实上，世界上50%的AI研究人员都在中国，他们开发了非常好的AI技术。实际上，当今世界上最流行的AI模型，开源模型，都来自中国，所以他们发展得非常非常快。美国必须继续以极快的速度发展，否则，世界竞争非常激烈。所以我们必须……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that's not what I said. Um what I said was that China has very good AI technology. >> They have many uh AI researchers. In fact 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China and they develop very good AI technology. In fact the most popular AI models in the world today are open- source models are from China and so they're moving very very fast. United States has to continue to move incredibly fast and otherwise otherwise uh the world is very competitive. So we have to</p>
</details>

Jensen 显然是在试图挽回面子。他一说中国领先于美国，人们就害怕了。他试图澄清。听着，澄清是有道理的。但从根本上说，现在人们开始思考，因为隐含的假设是，如果 Jensen 发出这个警告信号，说中国领先于美国，他是在试图说英伟达应该能够向中国销售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Jensen's obviously trying to save face there. I mean, as soon as he said China's ahead of the US, people got scared. And he's trying to clarify. And look, the clarification makes sense. But at its core, you got people now starting to think because look, implicitly the assumption is if Jensen is sending this warning signal that China is ahead of the US, he's trying to say that Nvidia should be able to sell to China.</p>
</details>

所以市场在想，他为什么这么急于向中国销售？是因为如果无法进入中国市场，他就没有足够的需求来维持估值吗？根据他在 GTC 上所说的，没有中国，他们仍然做得很好。但显然，他在这些公开声明中的语气可能说明了一些不同的东西。所以这就是为什么我认为市场现在有点更担心了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the market's thinking, well, why is he so desperate to sell to China? Is it because he doesn't have enough demand to sustain the valuation if you can't access the Chinese market? based on what he said at GTC, without China, they're still doing great. But obviously the tone of his voice when it comes to these public statements might say something that's different. And so that's why I think the market's a little a little bit more concerned right here.</p>

### 知名投资者动态：Brad Gerstner 与 Alex Karp 的观点

Brad Gerstner 认为，纳斯达克指数从四月份的底部上涨了40%，一路高歌猛进。所有这些人工智能股票都一路走高。市场似乎在寻找一个喘息的理由。山姆（奥特曼）在播客上有点好斗。他说：“听着，我们的收入超过130亿美元。”他刚刚在他的推文中说，他们年底的收入将达到200亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The NASDAQ's gone up 40% off of the bottom in April, right? Straight up and to the right. All these AI stocks have gone up to the right. The market was kind of looking for a reason for a breather. And you know, Sam came on the podcast. He was a little bit feisty. And he said, "Listen, we're doing more than 13 billion in revenue." And he just said in his tweet that they're going to exit the year at $20 billion in revenue.</p>
</details>

这仍然只是他们花费的一小部分。是的。正如我事后在推特上澄清的那样，我说，很不幸，大家都把注意力集中在了他的好斗上，而不是实质内容。山姆在播客上和之后多次表示，他预计他们在27年或28年的收入将超过1000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's still a fraction of what they're spending. >> Correct. And you know, as I clarified in my tweet after the fact when I said, you know, it's unfortunate everybody focused on the feistiness and not on the substance. What Sam said multiple times on the pod and since is that he expects that they'll do over a hundred billion in revenues in 27 or 28.</p>
</details>

如果他们能做到这一点，并且你把资本支出分摊开来，我们谈论的是1.4万亿美元，其中一半将由他们的合作伙伴承担。所以现在我们降到了6000或7000亿美元，这分摊到5年。所以现在我们谈论的是每年1000到2000亿美元的资本支出，需要由 OpenAI 承担。现在，如果他们在2028年、2029年能做到1000到2000亿美元的收入，那么现在我们就处于负责任的范围内了。所以我认为，市场在真正消化事实之前，有点操之过急了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if they're doing that and you spread the capex out, so we talk about 1.4 trillion, half of that's going to be borne by their partners. So now we're down to 6 or 700 billion and that's spread out over 5 years. So now we're talking 100 to 200 billion of capex per year that needs to be borne by open AI. Now if they're doing 100 to 200 billion in revenue in 2018 29 then now we're in the zone of responsible and so I think that that you know the market kind of ran with this before it really digested the facts.</p>
</details>

Alex Karp 表示，他不会告诉人们任何事，而是会说去看看我们的数据。我们的“114法则”得分是企业软件领域中最好的，我认为是前所未有的。一个好的分数是45，一个非凡的分数是60。114就像奥运会上的迈克尔·菲尔普斯。我会说，去看看我们在美国的增长，121%。看看我们在美国77%的总增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh, well, actually, I wouldn't tell them anything. I would say go look at our numbers. Uh, we have the single best uh rule of 114, which is like the Olympic score in in in enterprise software that I think anyone's ever printed. So a great score is 45. An extraordinary score is like 60. 114 is like Michael Phelps at the Olympics. I would say go look at our growth in the US 121%. Uh you know look at our aggregate growth in the US 77%.</p>
</details>

但实际上，我真正想告诉那些我关心的人，也就是 Palantir 的员工和过去几年用自己的钱投资的人，是 Palantir 旅程中我最自豪的事情：我们为美国的普通男女创造了风险投资级别的回报。这意味着，如果你投资了 Palantir，你的回报率是1000%。过去，你唯一能做到这一点的方式，就是成为哈佛大学的捐赠基金，顺便说一句，他们给人们提供了史上最糟糕的教育，但却不知何故获得了不公平的结果和不公平的回报，因为他们可以使用专门的工具和世界上最优秀的人才。所以，是的，作为一个美国的卡车司机，投资 Palantir 的回报比哈佛捐赠基金用最好的资源得到的回报还要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">more importantly um uh but actually what I would really tell uh the people I care about on that which are Palunteerians and people who invested their own money over the last couple years is the things I'm most proud about about the Palunteer journey is we we've printed venture results for the average man and woman in America meaning if you invested in Palunteer you're up a thousand% and the only other way you could have done that in the past would be like be an endowment at Harvard by the way giving people the worst education ever but somehow having unfair results and unfair returns because they can use specialized instruments and the best people in the world. So yes, you did better as a as a truck driver in America investing in Palunteer than the Harvard endowment did with the best.</p>
</details>

当被问及做空者时，Karp 表示，他不喜欢做空者。他认为在 Burry 的案例中，发生的是市场操纵。他强烈怀疑 Burry 当时正在平仓，而为了平仓，他通过诋毁有史以来最好的财务数据来搞砸整个经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> by the way, I I what I was defensive about, not defensive, I would say offensive about I don't like short sellers. And you know, everyone's like, "Oh, it's price discovery. Great." That's like saying you're a lawyer. You don't have to defend the pedophile. You know, yeah, I'm all in favor of everyone having a defense. I'm in favor of civil rights and defense for the innocent and for of the guilty because that's how you have civil liberties. If you're a lawyer, you don't have to work for a terrorist. You don't have to work for a pedophile. If you're a short seller, you do not have to actually short a truly great company. By the way, the thing that's great about Palunteer is we deliver for the average person on the battlefield, on the work floor, and as investors. pick some other company to screw with. But actually in the in the in the Bur case, I I actually think what was happening was market manipulation. I strongly suspect he was getting out of his position. And to get out of his position, he had to screw the whole economy by bismerching the best financials ever. Again, financials that are are helping the average person as investors on the battlefield, etc., etc.</p>
