### 歇斯底里症的历史与性别偏见

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 1980年，《**星球大战：帝国反击战**》成为一部轰动一时的电影，**Pink Floyd**的《**Another Brick in the Wall**》主宰了音乐排行榜。我提到这些并非为了轻视我接下来要说的话，而是为了强调这段历史是多么的近。1980年，也是**美国精神病学协会**将其诊断手册中“歇斯底里症”这一医学诊断移除的一年。1980年。这种疾病的根源可以追溯到古埃及和古希腊社会。事实上，“歇斯底里”一词来源于古希腊语中“子宫”一词。歇斯底里症曾被用来解释女性的健康问题，无论是否是身体上的，将其轻描淡写地归结为女性过于情绪化、神经质和歇斯底里。直到20世纪初，如果一个女性出现痉挛、抑郁或头痛等症状，并且有子宫，医生很可能会诊断她患有歇斯底里症。这种疾病的症状范围很广，从偏头痛到瘫痪、麻木、昏厥、出汗、呼吸困难、失眠，甚至性欲亢进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: In 1980, **Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back** became a blockbuster movie and **Pink Floyd's**, **Another Brick in the Wall** dominated the music charts. I say this not to trivialize what I'm about to say next, but to highlight how recent this history is. 1980 was also the year that the **American Psychiatric Association** removed hysteria as a medical diagnosis from its diagnostic manual. 1980. A condition that had its roots in ancient Egyptian and Greek societies. In fact, the word hysteria comes from the ancient Greek word for uterus, hysteria. Hysteria was used to explain away women's ill health, whether it was physical or not, to minimize and dismiss it as a woman being too emotional, neurotic, and hysterical. Until the early 1900s, if a woman had symptoms like cramps, depression, or a headache, and had a uterus, a doctor would probably diagnose her with hysteria. Symptoms of this disorder could run the gamut from migraine to paralysis, numbness, fainting, sweats, difficulty in breathing, insomnia, and even nymphomania.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 大约在1880年，神经学家**Jean-Martin Charcot**改变了人们对歇斯底里症的看法，他推测歇斯底里症并非妇科疾病，而是神经系统疾病。他认为可以通过催眠治愈。他后来承认歇斯底里症是一种精神疾病。尽管**Charcot**认为歇斯底里症影响男性和女性，但它主要仍然是女性的诊断。患有歇斯底里症的女性被认为是魔鬼附身，而不是身体疾病。这些女性被认为是“恶魔附体、有罪和被污染的”。她们是女巫，应该被烧死在火刑柱上。歇斯底里症的治疗方法是暴力的，包括放血、催吐、子宫切除术、水蛭疗法和强制盆腔按摩以诱导性高潮。在1940年代，大多数住院患者是男性。但到1942年，75%的脑叶切除术是在女性身上进行的。那还不到100年前。歇斯底里症的遗产至今仍体现在女性在健康方面所经历的医疗煤气灯效应和性别偏见中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Around 1880, neurologist **Jean-Martin Charcot** changed how hysteria was viewed when he surmised that hysteria wasn't a gynecological disorder, but a neurological one. He thought it could be cured through hypnosis. He would later acknowledge that hysteria was a psychiatric disorder. While **Charcot** believed hysteria impacted both men and women, hysteria remained mostly a diagnosis for women. Women with hysteria were thought to be possessed by the devil rather than suffering from a physical malady. These women were thought to be "demonic, sinful, and contaminated". They were witches to be burned at the stake. Treatments for hysteria were violent and included bloodletting, induced vomiting, hysterectomy, leeching, and forced pelvic massage to induce orgasm. In the 1940s, most institutionalized patients were men. But by 1942, 75% of lobotomies were carried out on women. That was less than 100 years ago. And the legacy of hysteria is reflected today with the medical gaslighting and the gender bias that women experience when it comes to their health.

### 女性心理健康的误诊困境

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 谈到女性，心理健康已成为一种“替罪羊”诊断。患有**ADHD**的女性更容易被误诊为焦虑症、抑郁症或双相情感障碍。此外，研究表明，女性在患有子宫内膜异位症或狼疮等自身免疫性疾病时，往往被误诊为焦虑症、抑郁症和双相情感障碍。当女性需要子宫内膜异位症等疾病的护理时，她们却得到了精神疾病的诊断。而当她们需要精神疾病的护理时，却又被误诊。这是一种两难的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: When it comes to women, mental health has become a "scapegoat" diagnosis. Women with **ADHD** are more likely to be misdiagnosed with anxiety and depression or bipolar disorder. As well, studies show that instead of diagnosing women with endometriosis or an autoimmune disease like lupus, women are often misdiagnosed with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. When women need care for things like endometriosis, they get a mental illness diagnosis. And when they need care from mental illness, it's misdiagnosed. It's a no-win situation.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 女性的健康和心理健康都很重要。虽然男性自杀的可能性更大，但女性有自杀念头的可能性更大，并且尝试自杀的可能性是男性的三倍左右。根据**CAMH**（成瘾与精神健康中心）的数据，女性被诊断出抑郁症的可能性是男性的两倍，她们的症状与男性不同，且症状比男性更严重。考虑到直到1993年女性才被纳入临床试验，并且我们现在才更多地了解雌激素等激素如何影响我们的健康和更年期过渡，我们对女性心理健康的了解有多少？我们又如何信任一个数据和研究主要围绕男性身体建立的系统呢？难怪女性在心理健康方面被误诊、误治和误解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Women's health and mental health matters. While men are more likely to die by suicide, women are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and are about three times more likely to attempt suicide. According to **CAMH**, women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression, have different symptoms from men, and their symptoms are more severe than men. When you consider that women weren't included in clinical trials until 1993 and that we are now only learning more about how hormones like estrogen impact our health and the menopause transition, how much do we really know about women's mental health and how to trust the system where the data and research has been built mostly around the male body? It's no wonder that women are misdiagnosed, mistreated, and misunderstood when it comes to their mental health.

### 介绍嘉宾与书籍

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 在今天的节目中，我们采访了科学作家兼健康研究员**Misty Pratt**，她的书名为《**All in Her Head: How Gender Bias Harms Women's Mental Health**》。**Misty**在15年间因心理健康问题获得了五种不同的诊断，每种诊断都来自不同的医生。我们与她探讨了她为何认为“所有精神疾病最初都被构建为女性疾病”，以及为何心理健康系统充满了偏见，以及我们为何不能在不考虑“心理健康是全身健康”的情况下谈论心理健康。**Misty Pratt**现在加入我们。**Misty Pratt**，欢迎来到播客。你好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: On today's episode, we speak to science writer and health researcher **Misty Pratt** about her book, **All in Her Head: How Gender Bias Harms Women's Mental Health**. **Misty** received five different diagnoses for her mental health over 15 years, and each diagnosis was from a different practitioner. We speak to her about why she argues that "All mental illnesses were first constructed as feminine disorders and why the mental health system is steeped in bias and how we can't talk about mental health without considering that 'mental health is whole body health.'" **Misty Pratt** joins me now. **Misty Pratt**, welcome to the podcast. Hi.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 嗨，非常感谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Hi. Thank you so much for having me.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 非常感谢你的加入。你能向我们的听众介绍一下你自己以及你的工作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Thank you so much for joining me. Could you please introduce yourself to our listeners and what you do?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 当然。我在多伦多的一家健康研究所从事医疗保健传播工作。在此之前，我自己也是一名健康研究员，同时我也是一名作家和作者，我喜欢写关于女性健康、心理健康以及各种各样的事情。嗯，在2024年，你发布了你的书《**All in Her Head: How Gender Bias Harms Women's Mental Health**》，这本书第一章的第一句话就令人震惊。你写道：“我五岁那年，我的祖母疯了。”你为什么想从你祖母的故事开始呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Absolutely. Yeah. So I work in healthcare communications for a health research institute in Toronto. Prior to that I was a health researcher myself as well and I am also a writer and an author and I like to write about women's health and mental health and all sorts of things. Well, in 2024, you released your book, **All in Her Head: How Gender Bias Harms Women's Mental Health**, and the first line of the first chapter in the book just takes your breath away. You write, "I was 5 years old the night my grandmother lost her mind." Why did you want to start with your grandmother's story?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我其实是想写一本关于我祖母的书。我想讲述她在五十多岁时被诊断出双相情感障碍的故事，这在80年代并不常见。但当我开始尝试这样做时，我意识到这个故事远不止关于她。它也关于我自己和我的精神疾病。它还关于许多其他女性以及她们在医疗系统中的经历。所以我想从她的故事开始，为我为什么要探讨这个话题奠定基础。但我也想超越那个故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: I actually wanted to write a book about my grandmother. I wanted to tell her story about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her mid-50s, which at the time in the 80s was not a common thing. But when I started to try to do that, I realized the story was about so much more than her. It was about me and my own mental illness. And it was also about many other women and their experiences in the system. And so I wanted to start with her story to set the, you know, the groundwork of why I was, you know, tackling this topic. But I also wanted to go beyond that story as well.

</details>

### 祖母的经历与个人理解

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你第一次经历心理健康问题是在青少年时期，17岁。但是当你长大后，你祖母的经历是如何影响你对女性心理健康的理解的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Your first experience with your mental health was as a teenager at age 17. But as you got older, how did your grandmother's experiences inform your understanding of women's mental health?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 她在医疗系统里过得很艰难。她服用了一整套药物，有些药物在今天我们绝不会同时开给病人。所以她有很多副作用。她也经历了很多不被倾听，没有人真正理解她出了什么问题。所以我想对我来说，这只是影响了我看到她所经历的一切，然后是我自己所经历的，虽然我的情况更好一些。但是后来我开始和其他女性交谈，听她们的故事，我发现我祖母和那些我听到的故事之间有太多相似之处，我意识到这个话题比我最初想象的要大得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So, she had a really rough time in the system. She was put on a whole cocktail of medications, ones that these days we would never prescribe to somebody at the same time. So she had a lot of side effects. She had a lot of people not listening to her and not really understanding what was wrong with her. And so I think for me it just influenced what I saw her going through and then what I experienced which was better. But then I started to speak to other women and hear their stories and I saw so many similarities between my grandmother and then those stories that I was hearing that I realized the topic was a lot bigger than I initially thought.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你看到了哪些相似之处？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What were some of those similarities that you saw?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 很多时候，人们说她们去看医生寻求帮助，但有时会被敷衍了事。医生会拍拍她们的背，说：“你只是压力太大了，事情太多了，你需要休息。”所以她们没有得到所需的护理和支持，有时这可能是一种严重的精神疾病。其他时候，我认为很多时候是误诊。你去看医生，你有很多症状，有些是精神上的，有些是身体上的，结果你得到了一个精神障碍的诊断，而其他问题却没有得到检查。所以可能还有其他问题，因为我们知道精神疾病与许多其他疾病重叠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So, a lot of the time it's people are saying that they feel that they go into a doctor to get support and they're sometimes being brushed off. So, patted on the back and kind of saying, you know, you're just stressed out. You just have too much going on. You need to rest. So, not getting the care and support that they need for sometimes what could be a serious mental illness. And then other times it's I think a lot of the time it's misdiagnosis. So, you know, you go in, you have all these symptoms, some of them are mental, some of them are physical, and you end up with a diagnosis of a mental disorder and the other stuff doesn't get examined. And so there could be more going on because we know mental illness overlaps with many illnesses.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 然而我们往往不关注这一点，特别是对于女性，这主要是由于我们在女性健康方面看到的许多历史偏见。我们接下来会更多地谈论这一点。但是，你知道，这个故事对你来说是私人的，但你也为此书做了大量研究。你采访了许多专家。你记录了其他女性的亲身经历。你为什么想写这本书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And yet we don't tend to focus on that especially for women and that is due to a lot of historical bias that we see with women's health. We're going to talk a bit more about that. But you know this story is personal to you but you also spoke to you did a lot of research for this book. You spoke to many experts. You documented lived experiences from other women. Why did you want to write this book?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 就我个人而言，我一生中都觉得我出了问题，我有一些遗传疾病，或者我的大脑化学物质失衡了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Personally for me, what I felt throughout my life was that something was wrong with me that I had some genetic condition or my brain chemistry was off.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你实际上说你感觉自己“坏了”。你感觉自己“坏了”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You actually say that you were broken. You felt broken.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。我感觉自己完全“坏了”。我看着我的祖母，心想这就是我现在的命运了。直到我开始探索精神疾病的另一面，即它不仅仅关乎我们的生物学，还关乎我们的社会世界，我才恍然大悟，心想：等等，也许不仅仅是我自己的问题，也许不仅仅是我的大脑化学物质问题，还有更多的事情正在发生。所以这个信息，它改变了我的一切。所以我想这就是我想分享这个信息的催化剂，告诉其他女性，也许这是一个令人安慰的信息，让她们知道这不仅仅是发生在你体内的事情，也是发生在你周围的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes. I felt completely broken. And I looked at my grandmother and I thought this is my life now. And it was only when I started to explore the other side of mental illness that it's not just about our biology, it's also about our social world that I this light bulb moment happened where I went, wait a minute, like maybe it's not just all me, maybe it's not just my brain chemistry, you know, there's more going on. And so that message, I mean, it changed everything for me. And so I think that was the catalyst of wanting to share that message and and tell other women that maybe this is a comforting message to you to know that it's not just about what's going on in you, it's what's going on around you.

</details>

### 个人转变与治疗经历

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 它如何改变了你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: How did it change things for you?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 一切。它改变了一切。我想，嗯，我曾接受了几十年的治疗，进进出出。我大概见过15到20位治疗师，我一生中都试图好起来。我尝试过药物治疗，当我有了这个认识，然后开始更多地探索这一点时。它并没有消除焦虑，也没有消除抑郁。当然，它们仍然存在。但我有了这种全新的，我不知道这是否是自信，或者只是一种“我会好起来”的感觉，我会努力做我能做的事情，因为有很多我无法控制的因素。那么我今天要做些什么才能让自己感觉好一点呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Everything. It changed everything. I think I had it had been, you know, decades of treatment in and out of treatment. I had seen I I would count probably 15 to 20 therapists over my life that I had seen trying to get better. I had tried medications and when I had this realization and then started to explore that a bit more. It didn't take anxiety away, it didn't take the depression away. Sure, they still came. But I had this newfound I don't know if it was a confidence or just a sense of like I'm going to be okay through this and I'm going to work on what I can because there's so many factors outside of my control that I do that I can't work on. So what am I going to do to just make myself feel better today? And

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 随着时间的推移，我确实开始感觉好转。焦虑减少了。但我想说，这没有治愈。并不是说，哦，我余生都会成为一个非常平静、禅意的人。我仍然是我。但是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Over time I did start to feel better. Anxiety was, you know, less. But I would say I'm not it's there's no cure. It's not like, oh, for the rest of my life, I'm now going to be this very calm, zen person. I'm still me. But

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你有五种不同的诊断，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And you had five different diagnoses, right?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。是的。没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes. Yes. Exactly.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那一定也很令人困惑，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: That must have been very confusing, too, right?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 太困惑了。是的。有时我离开诊室时会想：“什么？我现在得了这个？”每次我见到新的医生，都会对我的精神疾病有新的看法，这让我意识到它是非常主观的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So confusing. Yeah. There was times where I kind of left an office and went, "What? I have this now?" It just seemed strange to me that every time I saw a new provider, I would get a new perspective on my mental illness. and it made me realize it's very subjective.

</details>

### 医疗系统中的性别偏见

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 让我们谈谈你的书名，性别偏见如何损害女性的心理健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Let's get into your book's title, how has gender bias harmed women's mental health.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我认为这很大程度上是历史性的。如果你回顾历史，看看女性在医疗系统中普遍是如何被对待的，女性被认为是次等的。所以男性身体是我们认为应该努力达到或实现的标准。因此，女性的健康大部分被忽视了。直到1993年，女性才被纳入临床试验。即使到了现在，我们仍然缺乏与女性特定疾病相关的健康研究。也就是说，那些可能影响出生时为女性的人的疾病。我想，当我们审视历史和女性心理健康时，总有那么一幅画面，一个女人只是在虚空中尖叫，或者她只是歇斯底里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So, I think a lot of this is historical. So, if you can go back in time and see how women have been treated in the medical system in general, women were considered lesser than. So, the male body was kind of the standard of what we thought we should be working towards or achieving. And so women's health has mostly been ignored. Women were not included in clinical trials up until 1993. And even then now we still have this shortage of health research related to female specific conditions. So things that might affect somebody who's born as a female. I think too when we look at history and women's mental health, there's that, you know, picture of a woman just kind of like screaming into the void or she's just hysterical.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你写道，女性身体仍然“笼罩在神秘之中”的原因之一是，关于女性健康和疾病的医学文献要么缺乏，要么根本不存在。为什么会这样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You write that one of the reasons that the female body remains "shrouded in mystery" is because medical literature on female health and disease is either lacking or non-existent. Why is that?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我认为更具体的答案是**沙利度胺悲剧**，这种药物在怀孕期间被开给女性治疗晨吐，导致婴儿出现可怕的畸形，并导致大量死亡。因此，人们对此感到恐慌。他们说我们不想让任何女性参与试验，因为她们可能怀孕或即将怀孕的可能性很小。这是一个原因。我认为另一个更大的原因，如果你回顾历史，那就是女性在我们的文化和世界各地许多文化中都没有受到重视。所以当你作为一个人类不重视某人时，你就不会有动力去更多地了解她们，或者以一种不那么偏见的方式了解她们的身体。这很有趣，因为我敢肯定有人听到你刚才说的话，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So I think the the more specific answer is that the **thalidomide tragedy** which is this drug that was prescribed to women during pregnancy for morning sickness caused horrible deformities in babies and led to a lot of deaths. And so because of that people sort of freaked out. They went we don't want to include any women in trials for the little chance that they may be pregnant or getting pregnant. So that's one cause. I think the other sort of bigger cause if you take a look at history is that women have not been valued in our culture and in many cultures around the world. And so when you don't value somebody as a human being, you're not motivated to find out more about them or understand their bodies in a way that's less biased. It's interesting because I I'm sure someone listening to what you just said,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我想会有一种防御机制，说：“哦，我们重视女性。”但是，嗯，看看你所做的研究，实际上恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I think there's a like defense mechanism to say, "Oh, we value women." But looking at the research that you've done, it's actually the opposite.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。很多人会说：“但我们已经取得了很大的进步，看看我们现在在哪里。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yeah. A lot of people will say, "But we've come so far, like look at where we are now."

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，这是真的。嗯，很多事情都改变了。对于，嗯，你知道，更富裕的白人女性来说，确实改变了很多。但是如果我们从不同女性的交叉性角度来看，我们会发现对所有人来说，事情并没有改变那么多。而且，如果我们看看我们现在所处的政治文化气候，我认为正在发生一种纠正，一些有权势的人，嗯，我不会说所有男性，但一些有权势的男性并不真正想继续走我们现在走的这条路。他们想逆转。他们想回到过去。所以，嗯，是的，还有很多需要改变，我认为我们可能会失去很多东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes, that is true. A lot has changed. A lot has changed for, you know, wealthier white women for sure. But if we kind of look at a cross-section at intersectionality of of all different kinds of women, we can see things have not changed so much for everybody. And also if we look at the current political cultural climate that we're living in, I think there's this course correction happening where powerful people, I'm not going to say all men, but some men powerful men who don't really want to keep going on the the path that we're on. They want to reverse. They want to go back. So, yeah, there's there's a lot that still needs to be changed and I think there's a lot at risk of what we could lose.

</details>

### 生理性别与社会性别

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你在书中提到，生理性别（sex）或社会性别（gender），你不能只研究其中一个而忽视另一个。嗯，你这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You note in your book that sex or gender, you can't study one without the other. What did you mean by that?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我的意思是，生理性别是我们的生物学，对吧？所以，我们出生时被指定为女性。尽管现在很多科学家、生物学家都说男性和女性之间并没有我们曾经认为的那么清晰的区别。嗯，但这在科学中现在是这样定义的。而社会性别是一个社会变量。它是性别角色，但远不止于此。它是我们所拥有的期望，性别期望和社会化。所以如果你只研究其中一个，你就会错过整个其他领域，你本可以更好地理解，更好地理解人们的亲身经历。所以你必须将两者结合起来，因为如果我们只坚持其中一个，我们就无法得到清晰的画面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So, I mean, sex is our biology, right? So, it's we're born, we're assigned female at birth. Although a lot of scientists, biologists now are saying there's not a clear distinction between male and female as much as we once thought. But that's sort of defined now in the science. Whereas gender is this social variable. It's the it's gender roles but it's also so much more than that. It's expectations, gender expectations and socialization that we have. And so if you just study one, you're missing this whole other area that you you could be understanding better understanding people's lived experiences. And so you have to have both together because we just don't we're not going to get a clear picture if we just stick with one.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **Misty**，你能给我们举一个这种性别偏见在临床环境中是如何体现的例子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Misty, could you give us an example of how this gender bias appears in a clinical environment?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我在我的书中分享了一个研究，一项西班牙研究，涉及大量人群。研究内容是，如果一个男性和一个女性去看医生，描述了相似的症状，并且医生面前有相同的诊断标准清单。结果是，女性比男性更有可能带着诊断和药物处方离开诊室。所以我们看到的是，医生看待女性及其症状的方式中一定有什么东西，导致他们觉得，你知道，那是一种疾病，那是一个问题。而对于男性，他们看到后会觉得没关系，他可能只是需要休息一下。嗯，但这也会让我想起60年代70年代的那些电视节目，一个女人，你知道，服用镇静剂，因为为了让她在家过得愉快，嗯，这是一颗药丸，这会解决问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: So there was a study that was done that I shared in my book, a Spanish study with a large cohort of people. So men and women and what they looked at was if a man and a woman went into a doctor's office and described similar symptoms and the doctor had the same checklist of criteria of how to diagnose somebody in front of them. What was happening was that women were much more likely to leave that office with a diagnosis and with a prescription for medication than a man was. And so what we see is that there must be something in how doctors are viewing women and their symptoms that's causing them to feel like, you know, that's an illness, that's a problem. Whereas with men, they're seeing it and they're thinking it's okay, he probably just needs a break. Um, but it's also like it makes me think of those like TV shows from the 60s7s where a woman is, you know, on a tranquilizer taking a tranquilizer because in order for her to have a good time at home, um, here's a pill and that's going to solve the problem.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 绝对是。我认为这有点像“好吧，我们需要为你做点什么”，因为你来了，你抱怨这个问题，你感到焦虑。所以，当然，医生们会，特别是家庭医生，现在承受着各种压力，他们会选择容易获得的。而现在，那就是处方药。让一个人接受心理健康治疗，比如心理咨询，要比说“试试这种药，这可能会有帮助”困难得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Absolutely. I think it's kind of a okay, we need to do something for you because you've come in, you're complaining about this problem, you're feeling anxious. So, of course, doctors are going to, especially family doctors, right now with with everything, all the stress they're under, they're going to reach for what is accessible. And right now, that is prescription medications. It's much harder to get somebody into mental health treatment, such as therapy, than it is to be able to say, just try this drug, and this might help.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但即使你真的接受了治疗，心理咨询的等待时间也很长，而且费用也非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But even even if you do get into therapy, the wait times for therapy are so long and also super expensive.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。所以有公共资助的，但获得公共资助心理咨询服务的人数非常非常少，所以我们大多数人要么自掏腰包，要么通过工作获得健康福利。所以是的，这可能非常昂贵，而且你不可能第一次就找到合适的人。所以有时你会在不同的治疗师之间跳来跳去，很快用完你的福利，然后你一无所有。在书中，你采访的一位专家这样说：“女性感到抑郁，女性感到焦虑，女性有创伤。这只是女性特有的事情。”然后社会化使得男性无法探索他们所有的情绪。而这些情绪只是以愤怒的形式表现出来。我们不会因为男性生气而诊断他们，因为没有针对这种情况的诊断。那么这又如何为医学中的性别偏见创造了一个环境呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yeah. So there's publicly funded, but the number of people accessing publicly funded therapy services are very very small and so most of us are trying to either pay out of pocket or we have health benefits through a job. So yes, it can be enormously expensive and you can't always find the right person on the first try. So sometimes you're jumping around using up your benefits very quickly and then you're left with nothing. In the book, an expert you speak to says this. Women are depressed and women are anxious and women have trauma. It's just a woman thing. And then people socialize as men aren't getting access to explore all of their emotions. And those emotions just come out as anger. And we don't diagnose men for being angry because there isn't a diagnosis for this. How does that then create an environment for gender bias in medicine?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 嗯，这意味着女性更频繁地出现在医疗系统中。她们正在经历这个系统，然而她们却被以某种特定的眼光看待。她们被视为软弱、焦虑，并需要某些特定的治疗。所以这意味着，是的，我们在这个系统中。我们正在获得帮助，但这可能不是所需的帮助。而男性，我们可以看到，你知道，这是另一个方面，我认为其他人可以写一本书来探讨，那就是男性不那么频繁地进入这个系统，不被看到，他们的心理健康也得不到支持。所以这是一种推拉，就像，是的，我们正在获得帮助，但很多人报告说这不是他们需要的帮助，他们的精神疾病继续，嗯，遭受痛苦，或者他们的心理健康继续遭受痛苦。所以是的，这是一种具有挑战性的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Well, this means that women are in the medical system more frequently. They're going through the system and yet they're being viewed in a certain light. They're being viewed as weak or as anxious and as needing certain kinds of treatment. And so what that means is yes, we're we're in the system. We're we're getting help, but it may not be the help that is required. Whereas men we can see and you know this is a whole other side of things that I think somebody else could write a book about is that men are not getting into the system as frequently not being seen and not being supported with their mental health and so there's this kind of push pull of like yes we're we're getting help but a lot of people are reporting that it's not the help that they need that their mental illness continues to suffer or their mental health continues to suffer. So yeah, it's a it's a challenging situation to be in.

</details>

### 社会期望与药物治疗

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，你还写道，这很长，但我想把整段读出来，让大家了解你想要表达什么。你写道：“如果我们的抑郁部分源于性骚扰和暴力、创伤、照顾工作的精神负担、边缘化、贬值和贫困等经历。那么，我们的社会仅仅关注化学疗法来解决一个并非由我们造成但却影响我们的问题，以让我们保持敬业的母亲、积极的公民或专业的进取者，这真是一件奇怪的事情。我们收到的信息是‘吃药，然后继续生活’。”你能详细阐述一下你的思考过程吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You also write and this is pretty lengthy, but I want to read the whole thing for people to get an idea of what it is that you're trying to say. You write if our depression arises partially from experiences like sexual harassment and violence, traumas, the mental load from care, work, marginalization, devaluation, and poverty. It is a curious thing that our society focuses solely on the chem on a chemical fix for a problem not created by us but affecting us to remain dedicated mothers, engaged citizens or professional go-getters. We receive the message to just take her meds and get on with things. Can you expand your thought process around that?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。我在书中采访了一个人，**Julie Green**，她也是一位作家，她对此有亲身经历。她作为一位母亲，带着一个患有自闭症的年幼孩子，非常挣扎。她多年来一直断断续续地服用药物，经历了非常严重的副作用，这使得她很难继续服药以看到疗效。她被直接告知：“你需要继续服用这种药物，这样你才能成为一个好母亲，照顾你同样挣扎的孩子。”所以这是一种观念，认为我们可能不够坚强，无法继续下去。我们需要以某种方式被镇静。我们需要服药。这并不是说药物不好。绝对有些时候药物对我以及许多其他人都有帮助。但我认为，当这是一种下意识的反应，说：“哦，你应该服药，你需要继续服药，这样你才能履行你对社会的角色。”对我来说，这感觉非常有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yeah. So, I interviewed somebody in the book, **Julie Green**, who's also a writer, and she had direct experience with this where she was, struggling as a mother with a young child with, autism, and she was also had been on and off medication for a number of years, had experienced really serious side effects that were making it difficult to go on to keep taking the medication to see the benefits. and she was told directly, you need to stay on this medication so that you can be a good mother to your child who is also struggling. And so it's this notion of like we're we're not strong enough perhaps to to keep going. We need to be sedated in some way. We need to be medicated. And that's not to say medication is bad. There absolutely are times where medication has been helpful for me and for many other people. But I think when it's this knee-jerk reaction of, oh, you should be medicated, you need you need to stay on those meds so that you are performing your role for society. That to me felt very problematic.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 并且对一位母亲说，如果你想成为一个好母亲，就好像我们所有人都不努力成为好母亲一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And saying to a mother that if you want to be a good mother, as if we're not all trying to be good mothers.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yeah, exactly.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 顺便说一句，没有说明书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: There's no manual, by the way.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。是的。没错。什么是好母亲，对吧？一个好母亲是永不发脾气，永不感到焦虑或悲伤的人吗？那是一个好母亲，还是我可以有我的情绪并表达出来，我的孩子也能看到这些情绪？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yep. Yep. Exactly. And what is a good mother, right? Is a good mother somebody who never loses their temper, who never feels anxious or sad. Is that a good mother or can I have my emotions and show them and my child can see those?

</details>

### 心理健康污名与特定诊断

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我想，嗯，我不想说好的方面，因为，嗯，疫情很糟糕。很多人死了，它在很多方面改变了我们，也许我们几十年后才能完全理解。但它带来的一件事，嗯，以前并没有真正发生，那就是我们开始谈论心理健康和精神疾病。嗯，所以我们现在得到的信息是，告诉人们，你知道，如果你需要帮助，拿起电话，预约，和专业人士谈谈。这没有什么可耻的。但似乎仍然存在污名。就像，如果你是一位母亲，如果你说你正在挣扎，这几乎会让你感觉自己又像你之前说的那样，你“坏了”，也许你对你的家人，对你自己都是危险的。嗯，那么为什么女性心理健康仍然存在如此多的污名呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I think one of the I don't want to say good things because um co uh was awful. A lot of people died and it's changed us in so many ways that maybe we we won't actually fully understand for decades to come. But one of the things that came out of it um that wasn't really happening before is that we started to talk about mental health and mental ill illness. Um so the messaging now that we are getting is that that's telling people like you know if you need help pick up the phone uh make an appointment and talk to a professional. There is no shame in that. But it seems as if there's still stigma attached to it. Like if you are a mother, if you say that I am struggling, it almost kind of makes you feel as if you're again what you said before, you're broken and maybe you're a danger to your family, to yourself. Um, so why does it still seem like there's so much stigma attached to women's mental health?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我认为我们现在更能说“我正在挣扎，我需要帮助”了。甚至我知道在我的朋友中，我们现在非常公开地谈论精神疾病和我们的心理健康。然而，我想说，当涉及到我不想称之为“阴暗面”，而是精神疾病更困难的挣扎，比如精神病，嗯，你知道，崩溃到无法工作，嗯，可能失去家园。所有这些事情，我们仍然不觉得舒服去谈论这些，或者认识到这些是风险，可能会发生。所以我想你会有这样一群人，他们仍然认为，好吧，如果我，你知道，谈论这个，如果我谈论这些可怕的想法，我会发生什么？我的孩子会被带走吗？你知道，很多事情都会出现，你会看到我们仍然，仍然有一些东西在那里，特别是围绕着，嗯，挣扎中的母亲，女性和母亲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: I think that we are better now at being able to say, I'm struggling. I need help. And even I know amongst my friends we talk about mental illness and our mental health very openly now. However, I would say when it comes to the I don't want to call it the dark side but the the more difficult struggles of mental illness, psychosis, you know breaking down to the point of no longer being able to work potentially losing a home. like all of those things, we continue to not feel comfortable talking about those or recognizing that those are a risk and may happen. And so I think you get this whole population of people that still think, okay, if I if I, you know, talk about this, if I talk about these scary thoughts that I'm having, what's going to happen to me? Are are my children going to be taken away? you know, so many things kind of come up that you see that we still there's still something there and there's something there specifically around mothers, women and mothers who are struggling in their roles.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我有点震惊，某些诊断也存在污名。我总是说，是diagnosis还是diagnoses？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I was kind of shocked that there's also stigma around certain diagnosis. I always say is it diagnosis or diagnoses?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我想单数是diagnosis，复数是diagnoses。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: I think it's like singular is diagnosis and then diagnoses is more than one.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我总是，英语是我的第四语言。我尽力而为。嗯，但是你知道你在书中写道，某些，嗯，诊断，嗯，附带着污名，比如**边缘性人格障碍**。嗯，你还写道，这实际上是女性更容易得到的诊断。嗯，你能谈谈为什么会这样，以及围绕它的污名吗？嗯。所以，**边缘性人格障碍**可以直接追溯到歇斯底里症的诊断。所以，我们必须回到过去谈论弗洛伊德，我们不需要这样做，但是，嗯，你知道，可以说，这是一种诊断类别，我们不知道如何处理这些人。所以，他们不像患有神经症，比如焦虑和抑郁。嗯，所以他们被归入这个类别，就像，你知道，你只是处于边缘。随着时间的推移，诊断**BPD**的标准是，你知道，一个操纵性强、狡猾的人，很多这些形容词我们可能在过去，当我们谈论女巫狩猎时，曾归因于女性，那些，你知道，那些狡猾的女性，那些与某种精神世界有直接联系的女性。所以你就进入了整个，嗯，你知道，我不认为现在任何医疗保健提供者会说，哦，是的，我对**BPD**患者就是这种感觉，但你肯定会听到医疗保健提供者说，你知道，别听她的，她是**BPD**，嗯，你知道，她会撒谎，她会试图操纵你。所以我们从1800年代1900年代遗留下来的这部分，我们今天仍在努力应对。一些医疗提供者实际上认为**BPD**并不真正存在，它很可能是一种复杂创伤，也就是**复杂性创伤后应激障碍**，是生命早期发生的某种创伤事件，然后这些女孩和女性发展出一种应对方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I always like English is my fourth language. I'm doing the best that I can. Um but you know what you wrote in the book that certain uh diagnosis um have stigma attached around it something like **borderline personality disorder**. Um and and you also wrote that this is a a diagnosis that actually women receive more. Um can you talk about why that is and also the stigma attached around that? Mhm. So, **borderline personality disorder** specifically can be traced directly back to the diagnosis of hysteria. So, we we would have to go back and talk about Freud, which we don't need to, but uh you know, suffice it to say that this was a category of diagnosis that we didn't know what else to do with people. So, it wasn't like they were having neurosis, which was like anxiety and depression. Um, so they were placed into this category of like, you know, you're just sort of on the borderline. And over time, the the criteria that that came to be for diagnosing **BPD** was, you know, somebody who was manipulative and crafty and a lot of those adjectives that we maybe had attributed to women back in the day when we're talking about the witch hunts and about those, you know, those kind of crafty women, those those women that had kind of a direct line to some sort of spiritual world. And so you get into this whole um you know and I don't think any healthcare provider these days would say oh yes that's what I feel about about people with **BPD** but you certainly hear comments from healthcare providers that you know don't listen to her she's **BPD** um you know she's going to lie she's going to try to manipulate you and so there's this leftover piece we have from the 1800s 1900s that we're still grappling with today. Some care providers have actually argued that **BPD** doesn't really exist, that it's likely a complex trauma, so **complex PTSD** of something traumatic happening early in life, and then these these girls and women are then developing a way to to cope with that.

### 慢性病、精神负担与身心连接

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 你之前提到过一点，但女性被告知要“向前倾”，只要努力工作并保持韧性，我们就能做任何事，拥有任何东西。我会小声说出这个词，因为我厌倦了“韧性”。但是，如果你患有像子宫内膜异位症这样的慢性病，这种病需要数年才能诊断出来，而且非常痛苦，你仍然被期望出现在所有场合，并默默地承受这种负担。这种精神负担如何影响我们的心理健康？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You mentioned this a little bit before, but women are told to lean in that we can do anything and have anything if we work hard and be resilient. I'll whisper that word because I'm tired of being resilient. But but like if you're living with a a chronic illness like endometriosis, which takes years to diagnose and it's very painful, you're still expected to show up at all the things and to manage that load quietly. How does this mental load impact our mental well-being?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的，这是非常重要的一部分，而且，你知道，一两年前有一项有趣的研究表明，子宫内膜异位症和精神疾病之间存在巨大的重叠。所以，很大比例的子宫内膜异位症患者患有某种精神疾病。所以问题就变成了，是慢性病导致了焦虑和抑郁，还是精神疾病与子宫内膜异位症重叠？我们两者都经历了。我认为当你倾听女性和她们的故事时，你一遍又一遍地听到的是，当慢性病没有得到及时有效的治疗时，你的心理健康就会开始下降。所以你实际上可以追溯到女性没有及时获得所需护理的事实，这导致了抑郁和焦虑以及其他问题的恶化。所以它是你整个身心连接的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes, it's such a big part and I, you know, there's was an interesting study that came out just a year or two ago that showed that there's this huge overlap between endometriosis and mental illness. So, a really high percentage of people with endo had a mental illness of some kind. And so, the question becomes, is it the the chronic illness that leads to the anxiety and depression or is it the mental illness that that then kind of overlaps with that endo? And we're experiencing both. And I think when you listen to women and their stories, what you hear over and over again is that when a chronic illness is not being treated, you know, in a way that's going to make you feel better over time, your mental health starts to decline. And so you can actually trace the fact that women are not receiving the care that they need in a timely manner to worsening depression and anxiety and other issues. So it's part of your whole your mind and your body are connected in some way.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。甚至现在有一些研究表明，子宫内膜异位症和精神疾病之间可能存在生物学联系，身体中存在某种连接两者的东西，因为我们都是一体的。它不仅仅是大脑漂浮在这个空间中，你知道，我们的身体是独立的。你听说过英国一位母亲的故事吗？她，嗯，被送进了精神病院？嗯，我想她大约55岁，在更年期期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes. And even there are some studies now show showing that there's this could be this biological connection between the endometriosis and mental illness that there is something there in the body that's kind of connecting the two because it's we're all one. It's not just the brains floating off in this space and you know our body is separate. Have you heard of the story in England of a mom who was put in a psychiatric ward? I think it she when she was around 55 during menopause.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。她患有精神疾病，所以他们认为那实际上是一种精神疾病，结果却是更年期。因为她的儿子们为她争取，她现在去听音乐会，过着自己的生活。嗯，我只能想象有多少这样的故事发生过，而我们却不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes. And she had a mental so they thought that it was actually a mental illness and it turned out to be menopause. And because her sons advocated for her, she's now going to concerts and she's living her life. And I only I can only imagine how many stories that have happened that we don't know about.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。当我读到那个故事时，我哭了，因为我想起了我的祖母，我想，她的精神崩溃是更年期吗？如果她得到了他们理解这个过渡期可能是一个触发因素的治疗，我们能用荷尔蒙疗法纠正吗？那会改变什么？所以对我来说，我只是，我为这个女人感到非常高兴，但同时我又为我的祖母感到难过，现在也感到难过，她所经历的一切，以及她没有得到我认为她可能需要的照顾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes. And when I read that story, I cried because I thought of my grandmother and I thought, was her psychotic break menopause? Like, could she if she had been treated in a way that they understood this transitional period might be a bit of a trigger and could we could we correct that with hormonal therapy? What would have changed? And so I to me I was just I was so happy for this woman and then yet I was emotional for my grandmother and emotional now and what she went through and how she wasn't cared for in the way that I think she might have needed to be.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我很抱歉。嗯，这本书我想会帮助其他女性，让她们觉得，你知道，她们的故事很重要，它会帮助她们感到被看见。所以谢谢你写了这本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I'm so sorry. And um this book I think is going to help other women to be to feel as if you know their stories matter and it's going to help them feel seen. So thank you for writing it.

</details>

### 药物治疗的污名

**Misty Pratt**: 非常感谢。嗯，我们谈了一点关于药物治疗，因为，嗯，我们只剩下一点时间了。嗯，但是我们谈了一点关于药物治疗。服用药物有污名，但是不服用药物或者如果你正在服用药物而停止服用药物也有污名。为什么会这样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Thank you so much. Um, we talked a little bit about medication because, uh, we only have a little bit of time left. Um, but we talked a little bit about medication. There's a stigma to, uh, take medication, but there's also stigma to not take the medication or if you're on the medication to get off the medication. Why is that?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我认为社交媒体让事情变得有点，嗯，分裂。所以，你知道，我们现在有很多人的信息，这太棒了。人们会说，我服用药物，这帮助了我。服用你的药。对吧？这太棒了。但也有一个阴暗面，你知道，人们非常反精神病学。他们说药物是危险的。他们说，你知道，如果你服用它们，就会发生不好的事情。然后我们所有人都被困在中间，试图做出这些决定。所以，这非常个人化，对我个人来说，我尝试了很多次，但副作用对我来说太大了。所以，我不得不找到一种不依赖药物的方法。幸运的是，我有足够的特权，也有这些资源来做到这一点。嗯，但我想对很多人来说，我们甚至没有给他们选择，就像那个关于母亲的故事一样，我们说，继续服用你的药。这更容易，你知道，即使人们来抱怨，你知道，我，我没有性欲了。我，你知道，所有这些其他副作用正在发生，对他们来说真的很有挑战性，但我们只是说，继续服用你的药，没关系。所以，是的，这很棘手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: I think social media has made things a little bit, uh, divided. So, you know, we have all the messages now of people, and this is so great. People being like, I take medication, this helps me. Take your meds. Right? It's so amazing. But then there's this darker side of, you know, people are very anti-psychiatry. They say medications are dangerous. They say, you know, something's going to bad is going to happen to you if you take them. And then there's all of us stuck in the middle trying to make these decisions. And so, it's very individual and and personally for me, I tried I tried many times and the side effects were just too much for me. And so, I had to find a way through without it. And luckily I'm privileged enough and I had those resources to do that. Um but I think for a lot of people we don't even give them the option like just like that story about the the mother we say just keep taking your meds. It's it's easier you know even though people are coming in and saying you know I I have no more uh libido that's gone. I you know all these other side effects that are happening that are really challenging for them but we're just sort of saying just take your meds it's okay. So yeah it's tricky.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我希望这不会太冒犯，但我只是想，嗯，追问一下。你发现什么对你有帮助？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I hope it's not too intrusive, but I just wanted to follow up. What did you find helped you?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。我想我花了一年左右的时间才停药，让我的大脑重新调整。所以，一旦我度过了那一部分，我就知道我必须做些什么来度过难关，并且，你知道，在没有药物的情况下解决我的精神疾病。所以我开始探索不同的疗法。在书中，我稍微谈到了**认知行为疗法**，它并不总是适合很多人，而且很多人实际上并没有说它帮助很大，嗯，在特定情况下是的，但我发现了**躯体疗法**，这是一种基于身体的疗法，它从自下而上的过程起作用，这意味着我开始被要求深入我的身体，比如我的腹部有什么感觉，我的胸部有什么感觉，我的肩膀有什么感觉，而这其中有一些东西是我需要的，因为我一生都在与身体隔绝，对吧？我一直都在这里思考，思考，思考，而我的身体其他部分什么都没有发生。所以这对我来说真的是一个游戏规则的改变者，我今天仍然在继续这样做。但我自掏腰包，因为我没有这方面的保险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yeah. So, I think it took me about a year to get off the medication and for my brain to sort of recalibrate, I think. And so, once I got through that part, I knew I had to do something to to get through and and you know, address my mental illness without the medication. And so, I started exploring different therapy. And in the book I talk a little bit about **cognitive behavioral therapy** as not always the right answer for a lot of people and a lot of people don't actually say it helps very much um in specific circumstances yes but I discovered **somatic therapy** which is like a body-based therapy and it works from like a bottom up process meaning I started being asked to tap into my body like what do I feel in my my belly what do I feel in my chest what do I feel in my shoulders and and there was something about that that I needed because I'd spent my whole life just cut off, right? I was all up here thinking, thinking, thinking and nothing was going on in the rest of my body. And so that really was a game changer for me and I continued to to do that today. But I pay out of pocket because I don't have coverage for that.

### 女性心理健康研究的希望

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 好的，在我们最后的时刻，嗯，写了这本书，以及你采访的所有人，我想书中有大约40页是注释。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, in our final moments here, um, having written the book and all the people that you spoke to, I think it was like 40 pages in the book is notes.

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Yes.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我当时想，这有点过了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I was like, this is going a little overboard.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这太棒了。嗯，但是，嗯，展望未来，是什么让你对女性心理健康研究的现状充满希望？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: This is amazing. Um, but, uh, looking forward like what makes you hopeful about the state of research in women's mental health?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 哦，有很多事情。我的意思是，我在加拿大感到非常有希望，因为我认为我们确实对更多的女性健康研究有巨大的支持浪潮。如果我们看看多伦多的**成瘾与精神健康中心**，他们有一个完整的女性心理研究所，正在开始研究生理性别和社会性别以及所有这些与我们的精神疾病和其他脑部疾病相关的问题。所以当我看到这些事情发生时，我只是感到，是的，我们会成功的。这需要时间，但我们必须保持警惕，因为我们一开始谈到的那种逆转或倒退，我们需要继续推动，像我这样的人，倡导者，像你这样做播客的人，如果我们能继续保持这个对话，我认为我们最终会成功的，但这需要时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Oh, there's so many things. I mean, I feel really hopeful here in Canada because I think we do have this ground swell of support for more women's health research. If we look at the **Centre for Addiction and Mental Health** in Toronto, they've got a whole Women's Mental Health Research Institute that's that's starting to look at sex and gender and all of these these issues with our mental illness and other brain diseases. And so when I see those things happening, I just feel this sense of like yes, we are going to get there. It's going to take time, but we have to be on guard because what of what we talked about at the beginning in terms of this sort of reversal or clawing back that we need to continue to push as you people like me, advocates, people like you who are doing this podcast, if we can continue to keep this in the conversation, I think we will eventually get there, but it's it's going to take time.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，你还提到你问了每一位研究人员是什么让他们充满希望。嗯，你为什么这样做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You also mentioned that you asked every researcher about what makes them hopeful. Why did you do that?

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 我想当你从事研究时，我作为一名研究人员记得，有时你会陷入日常琐事中。而现在，许多科学家和研究人员正在经历许多挑战，包括他们的资金被削减。所以我想了解是什么让他们坚持下去。你知道，他们看到了什么，让他们能够说：“是的，这正是我需要做的。”嗯，我得到了很多很棒的回复。嗯，但我还要补充一点，我还问了女性，有哪些事情帮助了她们或让她们充满希望。她们一遍又一遍地说：有人倾听我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: I think when you're in in research, I recall this as a researcher is that you get bogged down in the day-to-day sometimes. And right now there's many, you know, scientists and researchers are experiencing a lot of challenges including cutting to to their funding. And so I wanted to get a sense of what it was that kept them going. You know, what what was it that they saw that that that then allowed them to say, "Yes, this is exactly what I need to be doing." And I got a lot of great responses. Um, but I will also add just for I also asked women what were some of the things that that helped or made them hopeful. And time and time again they said someone who listened to me,

</details>

**Misty Pratt**: 有人只是多给了我几分钟，坐在我身边说：“这真的很难。我支持你。我们会一起度过难关的。”我一遍又一遍地听到这句话，今天仍然如此。所以这也给了我希望，医疗保健提供者可以培养那种倾听的技能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Misty Pratt**: Someone who just gave me that extra couple minutes, sat with me and said, "This is really hard. I've got you. We're going to get through this together." And that over and over again, that's what I heard and I continue to hear that today. And so that also gives me hope that healthcare providers can work on those kind of listening skills.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah.

**Misty Pratt**: 提供那种富有同理心的支持。

**Misty Pratt**: No, I think that's it. Uh I you know I just really the the goal of the book was for people to read it and see themselves in it hopefully in some of those stories and I hope that that's what's happened and I hope that more people continue to write about this different voices not just me but many diverse voices so that we can change things for for the better but also for everyone.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Here's a comment from our episode on **Ella's Danlo syndrome**. I am in tears right now because **Sydney** is basically telling my story, too. I know very well the horrors that she's had to go through just to be taken seriously. I'm in Northern Ontario where complex medical specialists and modalities are basically non-existent. It took my doctor 6 years just to take my dislocation seriously. I have **hyper mobile EDS** and another 3 years in a car accident to begin looking into **CCI**. Just went for the first set of X-rays yesterday. I'm really looking forward to your upcoming segment that discusses things like this more in detail. Thank you from all of us. Thank you so much for your comment. I really do hope that you get the care that you need. This week's episode was produced by **Matthew Amara** and me and edited by **Colin Kish**. Digital shorts by **Ariana Longley**. Camera work by **Max Stussy**. Teleprompting by **Alyssa Verley**. Production support from **Jonathan Hallowell** and **TVO's** digital media services team. **Lori F** is the executive producer of digital. **John Ferry** is vice president programming and content. Thanks so much for listening.
