### 动荡的周末与抗议活动

**Michael Barbaro**: 我是 Michael Barbaro，欢迎收听《每日新闻》（The Daily）。就在联邦移民官员在车内杀害 **Renee Good** 的几小时前，明尼阿波利斯警察局长曾警告说，一场涉及 **ICE**（美国移民及海关执法局）与该市居民的悲剧似乎不可避免。今天，我与警察局长 **Brian O'Hara** 交流，谈谈他在明尼阿波利斯与 ICE 打交道的经历，以及为什么在他看来，总统的大规模驱逐行动正在破坏人们对像他这样的警察部门的信任。今天是 1 月 12 日，星期一。奥哈拉局长，感谢你在百忙之中，尤其是在这样一个忙碌的周末抽时间接受我们的采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: From the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is the daily. Just hours before a federal immigration officer killed Renee Good in her car, the Minneapolis police chief warned that a tragedy involving ICE and the people of his city seemed inevitable. Today I speak with that police chief Brian O'Hara about his experience with ICE in Minneapolis and why in his mind the president's campaign of mass deportation is undermining faith in police departments like his. It's Monday, January 12th. Chief O'Hara, thank you for making time for us on a Sunday, no less than a very busy weekend for you.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 没问题，谢谢你们邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Sure. Thank you for having me.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 从旁观者的角度来看，过去的 48 小时非常不同寻常。发生了大规模的抗议活动，我相信你自己也身处其中。我试着理清那些视频的头绪，对你来说，这是一种什么样的体验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: The past 48 hours were pretty extraordinary from the perspective of an outsider. There were these enormous protests. I believe you yourself ended up in the middle of one of them. I've tried to make sense of the video. I mean, what has this been like for you?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 事情是这样的：抗议活动最初是在一家酒店外开始的，人们认为联邦执法人员可能住在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: So what happened was we had a protest start outside of a hotel where people believed federal law enforcement might be staying.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 他们认为 ICE 特工住在那里，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: They believed ICE agents were staying there. Right.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 没错。在抗议游行过程中，局势演变成了**非法集会**。城市里通常会发生的事情发生了：一名神志不清的妇女把车开上了人行道，警察接到报警前往处置。当警车在那里处理常规警务工作时，突然发现自己被一群变得焦躁不安的人群包围了。我们的警员呼叫支援，说他们无法开车离开。我当时正和几名警察在附近，我们迅速冲进去推开人群，为警车开辟出一条通道。我想正是因为我们这样做了，可能进一步激怒了本就躁动的人群。我们迅速调集了 200 多名额外的警力，最终以非法集会罪逮捕了 30 人并随后将其释放。

这对警察局的所有成员来说都非常疲惫。这种情况已经持续酝酿了几周。这里发生的许多骚乱和混乱，都是由于某些联邦执法活动的方式导致的，这要求我们的警员必须介入并试图恢复和平，而他们自己往往成了人们发泄愤怒的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Right. Exactly. During the course of that protest in March is it sort of transitioned into an unlawful assembly and things that typically happen in cities happen and a woman who was disoriented drove her car onto a sidewalk and the police were called to respond. So while the police car was there dealing with regular police work uh suddenly they realized they had become surrounded by this crowd which had become unruly. So our officers uh called in uh that they were unable to drive out and I was in the area personally with other police officers. We just we quickly ran in to back the crowd out to get a path for the police car to come out. And I think because we did that, I think that may have contributed to emboldening an already unruly crowd. And we very quickly called in well over 200 additional police officers. And then ultimately we wound up placing uh 30 people under arrest for unlawful assembly and releasing them. It's been very taxing for all members of the police department and this is a situation that has been building up for several weeks. A lot of the disturbances and chaos that's been happening here as a result of the manner in which some federal enforcement activity is happening is requiring our officers to respond and step into situations and try and restore the peace where often times they themselves then become the target of people's frustration.

### ICE 的到来与针对性执法

**Michael Barbaro**: 你在暗示这一切的原因。我们找你谈话，当然是因为 ICE 在那里，但具体是因为上周发生的一件事：一名 ICE 特工枪杀了明尼阿波利斯居民 **Renee Good**。数以百万计的人已经在社交媒体和电视新闻上从各种角度看过了那段枪击视频。但在那次枪击之前，有一段序幕是很多人没有密切关注的，那就是从 12 月初开始，大量移民及海关执法局特工的到来。我想从那里开始谈起。作为警察局长，请带我回到那个时期。你当时对总统决定向你的城市派遣这些特工的理解是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, you're hinting at all this. The reason we're talking to you, of course, is because of the fact that ICE is there, but because specifically of what an ICE agent did in the middle of of last week, the shooting of a Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. A shooting that killed Ms. Good. And at this point, millions of people have watched the video of that shooting from every conceivable angle on social media, on TV news. But there was a leadup to that shooting that a lot of us didn't watch as closely and and didn't see on TV or on YouTube and that was the arrival of a large number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents starting in early December. And so that's where I want to begin. Take me back to that period for you as police chief. What was your understanding of why the president decided to send these agents to your city?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 大约一个月前的 12 月，公众舆论似乎很大程度上带有政治色彩。这源于该州确实存在的一个真实问题，即**欺诈问题**。FBI 和明尼苏达州的美国检察官办公室已经起诉了数十人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: About a month ago in December, it seemed like the public messaging was largely political and and it was a result of a real problem that does exist in the state and that is a problem with fraud. Uh dozens of people have been prosecuted uh by the FBI and the US Attorney's Office here in Minnesota.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你是指在明尼阿波利斯的**索马里社区**中被特别强调的欺诈行为。我想谈谈总统决定专门向明尼阿波利斯派遣移民官员时的信息。他在表达想法时非常直截了当。在他看来，这个城市规模庞大且著名的索马里群体，被他描述为一个制造混乱、犯罪的社区，简而言之，是一群应该被驱逐的麻烦制造者。我想知道你对此怎么看，这是否符合你作为局长的经验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: You're referring to the fraud that had been specifically highlighted. Yes. In the Somali community in Minneapolis. And I do want to talk about the president's message when he decided to send specifically immigration officers to Minneapolis. I mean, he was pretty explicit about his thinking. In his mind the Somali population in the city, which is sizable and wellknown. Yes. He described it as a community that was sewing disorder, committing crimes, basically in so many words, a community of troublemakers who should be deported. And I wonder what you made of that and if it felt like that had been your experience as chief.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我在距离曼哈顿下城约 10 英里的地方长大，在纽瓦克当了 20 多年警察。在搬到明尼苏达州之前，我不认识任何索马里裔美国人。但我在这里遇到的索马里裔美国人，包括这个城市的许多警察，对我非常欢迎。所以从个人角度来看，那种描述非常奇怪，因为我也意识到，那个社区的绝大多数人都是**美国公民**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, I'm from about 10 miles from lower Manhattan is where I grew up. I was a police officer for over 20 years in Newark, New Jersey. But I had not known any Somali Americans until I moved to Minnesota. And the Somali Americans that I have met here, including many of whom are police officers uh in this city, have been incredibly welcoming of me. You know, so from a personal perspective, it was just bizarre because I'm also aware that the overwhelming majority of people from that community are American citizens.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 那么从犯罪的角度来看，总统说的话有属实的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, from from a crime perspective, was anything the president was saying true?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 该州确实存在真实的欺诈问题，但不幸的是，在所有的政治辞令和极端反应中，这一点现在被掩盖了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, there is a real problem with fraud in the state and unfortunately that is sort of lost now in all of this political rhetoric and sort of the extreme reactions that occur.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你是在将欺诈与传统的街头犯罪区分开来。但你承认该社区确实存在一定程度的欺诈行为，也许这就是总统所指的。在你看来，这与你和你的警员每天处理的犯罪是不同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: You're you're drawing a distinction between fraud and kind of traditional street crime. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you're acknowledging that there's some level of fraud occurring perhaps in this community. Perhaps that's what the president is referring to. In your mind, that's distinct from perhaps the crime that you you and your officers are dealing with day in and day out.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的，绝对如此。那些导致数十人被起诉的案件是由明尼苏达州的美国检察官办公室和 FBI 领导的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes, absolutely. Those cases that were brought about uh leading to dozens and dozens of of prosecutions were led by the US attorney's office here in Minnesota as well as the FBI.

</details>

### 执法方式的冲突

**Michael Barbaro**: 明白了。那么在你看来，总统要求的这次专门针对 ICE 特工的部署，是合理的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Got it. So in in your mind, was this planned deployment specifically of ICE agents that the president asked for, was it warranted?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我的意思是，只要有 ICE 存在，明尼苏达州就有移民执法。我认为问题的核心不在于执行哪些法律，而在于**执法的方式**。如果是有计划的、针对违法者的定向执法，我认为所有执法部门都会支持。但如果执法过程缺乏周密计划，使用不被认可的战术，不必要地危及执法人员和社区居民的生命，那么作为管理机构的专业人士，我必须处理这些担忧并对此负责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: I mean, there have been immigration enforcement conducted in Minnesota as long as there has been ICE. I think the problem is what gets lost in this is it's not necessarily about which laws are being enforced. It's about how that enforcement is happening. To the extent that there are wellplanned, pre-planned, targeted enforcement against people who who are violating the law, I think all of law enforcement can very clearly get behind that. But to the extent that things are being conducted that may not be well planned, using tactics that generally are not viewed as sound, that may unnecessarily endanger the lives both of law enforcement officers conducting that enforcement as well as the lives of people in the community. Certainly, those are concerns that I have to deal with and I am responsible for as a professional managing my agency.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 听起来对你来说，问题不在于 ICE 的到来，而在于他们到来的方式。那么让我们谈谈这个。总统主张在明尼阿波利斯进行更大规模的移民执法，并在 12 月初付诸行动。这些 ICE 特工的操作是如何进行的？又是如何开始影响你领导的警察局的？发生了什么变化？你暗示他们的战术有所不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Mhm. So it sounds like for you it's not the fact of ICE coming that is the issue, it's the way that that that ICE came. So So let's talk about that. So the president makes his case that immigration enforcement should be happening on a larger scale in Minneapolis and in early December he makes it happen. How did the operations of these ICE agents work and how did it start to affect the police department that you run? What changed? I mean, you're hinting that their tactics are different.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的。社区居民拨打 **911** 的次数急剧增加，这与街头执法有关。情况五花八门：有人被捕后，他们的车被留在马路中间阻碍交通，甚至有一次车都没挂 P 档，直接顺着路往前溜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes. So, we've just gotten a pretty dramatic increase in 911 calls from people in the community related to a lot of the street enforcement that's happening. And I mean it's everything from people are being arrested and their cars are left in the roadway sometimes blocking the street and at one case left when it wasn't even placed in park and was rolling down the road.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 等等，所以 ICE 官员把人从车里拉出来逮捕，却连档都不挂？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Wait. So so ICE officials are are are taking someone out of their car, arresting them and their car is not even put in park.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我们确实遇到过这种情况。还有一次，车里有一只狗，他们就把狗留在车里不管了。甚至就在今天早上，我们还接到电话说有人被 ICE 喷了**辣椒喷雾**。现在出现了各种各样的服务请求，我们必须去管理和分流，而这些在以前是不会发生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: We had that happen. We had another time where there was a dog in the car and they left the dog in the car. Wow. I mean, even this morning, we've gotten calls for individuals who were pepper-sprayed by ICE. There's just a variety of calls for service that we then have to manage and triage that were not happening before.

</details>

### 警务改革的“崩溃点”

**Michael Barbaro**: 这种因为 ICE 战术而突然涌入的 911 电话，对整个部门有何影响？它如何增加了你们警务工作的复杂性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And how does that sudden influx of 911 calls because people are experiencing ICE tactics affect the department as a whole? How does it complicate your policing?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 这让事情变得复杂，因为我们仍然严重**人手不足**。这是明尼阿波利斯警察局。2020 年在这里工作的大多数警察，五年后大部分都离开了，我们正在努力重建。目前的警力仍比正常水平低三分之一，而我们处理的严重街头犯罪却比过去高得多。所以这增加了额外的工作。最困难的一点是，我们被卷入了一些非常紧张、情绪化的局面，通常被要求介入并尝试**降级**（de-escalate）涉及联邦执法的冲突，但我们一出现，就立刻成了人们发泄挫折的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: It complicates things because we remain significantly understaffed. This is the Minneapolis Police Department. The majority of the cops that worked here in 2020, 5 years later, the majority have left and we're trying to rebuild. We remain one-third below what had been typical of of staffing for the police department here today. While we're dealing with a much higher level of serious street crime than what had been normal in the past. So, this is adding additional work. Probably the toughest distinction is we're getting called and pulled into situations that are very tense and very emotionally charged and often times we're asked to try and step in and deescalate situations where federal law enforcement may have been involved that very very quickly as soon as we show up we become the target of people's frustration.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 所以你一出现……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: H. So the minute you show up,

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我们一出现，我们就成了问题所在。人们已经准备好爆发了，局势可能瞬间失控。以我们现有的人手，加上调动国民警卫队所需的时间，我担心到时候就太晚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: the minute we show up, we're the problem. You know, people are ready to go, it could very very quickly explode. And with the level of staffing that we have and the time that it takes to get the National Guard to come in, it will be too late. That's my fear.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你一直在绕着这个问题谈，我想我们应该把它说得非常明确：你担任明尼阿波利斯警察局长是在一个非常特殊的时刻，带着非常特殊的使命。你在一名明尼阿波利斯警察谋杀 **George Floyd** 两年后到任，当时警局士气极度低落，社区对警局极度不信任。当你接手这份工作时，我查阅了旧剪辑，你称明尼阿波利斯是“全球警务大清算的零号地带”。你在工作中实施了彻底的改革，试图重建信任，修复警察与居民的关系。请给我们举几个你实施的改革例子，而这些改革现在显然正受到 ICE 存在的挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: I mean, you've been talking around this, and I think we should just make this extremely explicit, that you come to the job of being police chief in Minneapolis at a very specific moment with a very specific mandate. You arrive just two years after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd at a moment of extremely low morale for the department and really high levels of distrust of the police department by the community. And when you took this job, I went back and looked at the old clips. You called Minneapolis ground zero for a global reckoning on policing. and you in the job put in place sweeping reforms to try to rebuild trust, repair relationships between police and residents. Just give us a couple examples of the reforms you put in place and that presumably are now being somewhat challenged by ISIS presence.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我们非常强调**武力使用**、采用降级策略以及关键决策实践。我们举行了数十次社区会议，在修订政策时听取社区的意见。归根结底，这一切都是为了以一种赢得社区信任而不是疏远民众的方式来打击犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: So, we have placed a very strong emphasis on use of force, on employing deescalation, on the use of critical decision-making practices. We have gone out and had dozens of community meetings to get input from community as we revise our policies. And I think it it all boils down to trying to fight crime in a way that earns community trust as opposed to alienating people.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 按照你的说法，突然之间，几周前，所有这些工作都面临着一群外来的联邦执法官员。他们在你的城市做着警察的工作，却不向你负责，也不一定会投入到你所实施的改革努力中。他们有完全不同的任务。听起来你是在说，突然之间，这立即掩盖、挑战并复杂化了你作为警察局长承担的整个项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And from what you're saying, suddenly, as of a few weeks ago, all of that work is confronted with an outside group of federal law enforcement officials arriving in your city doing police work, but who don't answer to you and are not as inevitably invested in the reform efforts that you have put in place. They have a totally different mandate. And it sounds like you're saying all of a sudden that is just immediately overshadowing, challenging, complicating this entire project that you have overtaken as police chief.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 绝对是这样。在所有这些挑战中，当我们试图治愈这个社区，试图治愈留在这里的男女警员并重建时，他们已经是全国受到最严厉审视的警察部门了。我可以告诉你，这里的警察也是人。我担心我们可能会达到一个**崩溃点**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Absolutely. And in the midst of all of those challenges, while we're trying to heal this community, while we're trying to heal the men and women who have remained here and rebuild, while they're already the most scrutinized police department in the nation and and I can tell you like the cops here, we're human beings. And it's I worry that we might hit a breaking point.

</details>

### 蕾妮·古德枪击案及其预见性

**Michael Barbaro**: 随着几周过去，居民们似乎自发地开始监视 ICE 特工及其活动。明尼阿波利斯是一个相当自由的城市，居民们组织成了小组，跟踪 ICE 特工，互相发短信，吹哨子。这实际上形成了一种相当有意义的反制执法行动。你是否觉得这本身成了一个问题？你是否希望居民不要这样做？你有没有试过劝阻他们？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: It feels like as the weeks went on here that residents are taking it upon themselves to monitor ICE agents and their activity. Minneapolis, this is not a secret pretty liberal city. And there are residents who organize themselves in this period into groups. They're shadowing ICE agents. They're texting each other. They're blowing whistles. and it's amounting to a pretty meaningful effort to counter their enforcement operations. I don't know if you quibble with that word. Does that become its own problem? And did you find yourself wishing that the residents were not doing that? Did you try to discourage it?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我可以告诉你，美国警察和执法部门的角色首先是保护生命，但也要确保人们的人权和宪法权利。在这个国家，人们拥有**第一修正案**赋予的权利去观察、记录和反对政府活动。这包括明尼阿波利斯警察的行为，也包括我们城市的其他执法活动。这确实是一个挑战，但这是美国警务多年来一直在处理并试图改进的挑战。它确实给我们的工作增加了复杂性。但我只想明确一点：我并不是要求联邦执法部门做任何超出我对明尼阿波利斯警察局男女警员要求之外的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, I can tell you the role of the police and law enforcement in the United States is first off to protect life, but it's also to ensure people's human rights and their constitutional rights. And people in this country have a first amendment right to observe, record, and object to government activity. And that includes the activity that Minneapolis police officers do as well as other law enforcement in our city. And so it is a challenge, but it's a challenge that policing in America has been dealing with and and trying to improve upon uh for many years. It does add a level of complication to our work. But I I just want to be clear though. I'm not asking for federal law enforcement to do anything differently than what I expect the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department to do.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你描述的情况听起来显然是一个易燃的组合。ICE 特工按照自己的系统和规则运作，而居民们行使第一修正案的权利包围、监视并对他们尖叫。这显然构成了一个非常微妙的局面。我想问你一个时刻，因为这感觉非常有预见性。就在过去一周左右，你在新闻发布会上说你很担心。你对联邦执法人员说，你们有工作要做，但请合法行事；同时也对社区成员说，你们可以抗议，但请和平进行。你当时说，最担心的风险是发生动乱或悲剧，有人受重伤或死亡。你似乎预感到会有可怕的事情发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: What you're describing clearly sounds like a pretty combustible combination. You've got ICE agents who are operating with their own systems and set of rules and then you have these residents in your words operating the first amendment right to surround them to monitor them to scream at them and this is adding up to clearly yes a very delicate situation and there's a moment that I want to ask you about because it felt oddly preient where within the last week or so You stand up at a news conference and you say basically I am worried. I I do have an ask that's both for federal law enforcement who you say may not be from ICE agents. You have your job to do but please do it lawfully. Um and at the same time to members of the community residents yes you can have your protest. Please do it peacefully. officially. Uh I've been concerned for weeks that because the issue is so emotional and because frankly some of the way this stuff has been carried out, the greatest risk to me is that there would be unrest or that there would be a tragedy, that somebody could get seriously hurt or killed. But you seem to kind of know that something awful was coming.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的。这是可以预见的，而且完全是可以避免的。我已经说了好几周了。就在悲剧发生的前一天，我还在新闻发布会上说过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes. I mean, this was predictable and it's also entirely preventable. I mean, I had been saying it for weeks. I literally said it at a press conference the day before.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 当你发现真的发生了一起涉及 ICE 特工的枪击案时，你的第一个念头是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And when you found out that it was true that there was a shooting involving an ICE agent, what was your first thought?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我很难形容那种感觉。我只是想，“该死，就是这个”，你知道吗？这可能会让 2020 年的局面重演，让 George Floyd 事件重演，导致城市的毁灭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: I mean, I'm having a hard time describing it. I I just thought, [ __ ] this is it, you know? This is the potential here for 2020 all over again, for George Floyd all over again. For the destruction of the city.

</details>

### 枪击案细节与专业质疑

**Michael Barbaro**: 我理解调查仍在进行中，我们不知道调查的具体形式或结论。我们稍后会讨论关于谁应该负责调查的冲突。但先关注枪击事件本身。你看过视频了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: So, I understand that an investigation is still underway of what happened in this shooting and we don't know exactly what that investigation is going to look like or what it's going to conclude. and and we'll talk in just a few moments about the conflict arising from the investigation over whose investigation it should be. But just to focus for a minute on the shooting itself. Have you watched the videos?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的，我看过网上公开的视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes, I've seen the videos that are available online.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 据你了解，事情是怎么发生的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: What is your understanding of how this unfolded?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我的理解是，有一名妇女在车里阻碍了交通，很可能是因为移民局特工在场，她可能在以某种方式抗议他们的出现。最终发生了某种对抗，联邦执法人员向车内开枪，杀害了她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: My understanding is that there was a woman who was in her car and was blocking the street. Likely because immigration agents were present. Uh, and she was likely protesting in some way immigration officials being present. Ultimately some confrontation occurred uh where federal law enforcement shot into the vehicle killing her.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 看过视频并可能与处警人员交谈后，你认为这在 ICE 官员和居民之间是一次合法的互动吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: H having watched the videos and spoken perhaps to responding officers, does this strike you as a lawful interaction between the ICE officer and the resident?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 作为一个当了 25 年警察的人，任何时候听到警察与一名手无寸铁的驾驶员发生枪击，都会让你停下来思考，这非常令人担忧。虽然政策和培训都在尽一切可能禁止并防止此类情况发生，但不幸的是，有时执法部门无法避免。作为专业人士，我们的职责是尽量防止人员陷入那种境地，以免不必要地制造出不合理的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, I can tell you as a police officer for 25 years, anytime you hear a situation where a cop gets into a shooting with an unarmed motorist, it gives you pause and it's very concerning because while policies and training try to do everything possible to prohibit those situations and to try and prevent them from occurring in the first place, there are times unfortunately where law enforcement cannot avoid those situations from occurring. The concern is as a professional to try and prevent our people from getting into that situation in the first place so that we're not unnecessarily creating the risk unjustifiably.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 让我们谈谈这个。你提到了培训。我的感觉是，在处理处于发动状态的车辆中的驾驶员时，有一些相当通用的警务规则。第一条就是你不要站在车辆行驶的路径上。这是“交通拦截 101”的基础。你不能那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, let's talk about that. You mentioned training. My sense is that there are some pretty universal rules around policing when it comes to a motorist in a running car. The number one is you don't place yourself in the path of the vehicle. That's like traffic stop 101. You don't do that.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 绝对如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Absolutely.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 所以在你看来，那名最终射杀 Renee Good 的 ICE 特工站在她的车前，这是一个危险信号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: So in your mind that's a flag that you have this ICE agent, the one who ends up shooting Renee Good standing in front of her car.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 绝对是。另一个问题是，这次行动的目标到底是什么？如果这个人不是预先计划的执法行动目标，那我们在做什么？我们是在尝试降级局势并解决问题吗？我们是在尝试采取执法行动并执行某种法律吗？目标到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Absolutely. And then the other one is what exactly is the mission here? Because if this person isn't the target of a pre-planned enforcement action, then what are we doing? Are we trying to deescalate and try and resolve the situation? Are we trying to take an enforcement action and enforce some law here or what exactly is is the goal?

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我们在这里关注的是 ICE 官员。我也想问问你关于驾驶员在那一刻的决策。她拒绝下车，即使在 ICE 特工要求她下车之后。她倒车然后向前开，她似乎不服从这些官员的口头命令。作为一个思考这些问题的人，让我们直白地问：她错了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: We're focusing here on the ICE officers. I do want to ask you about the driver's decision-m in this moment. Her refusal to get out of the car even after ICE agents demand that she get out of the car. Her reversing then driving forward. She appears to disobey spoken orders from from these officers. As somebody who thinks about this stuff, let's just ask this really plainly. Was she in the wrong?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我只能从警察的角度来谈交通拦截。我们的政策是什么？我们的培训是什么？第一，你接近驾驶员，介绍自己的职级、姓名和所属机构。你告诉对方为什么要拦截他们。你这样做是为了表明身份，确保专业性并尝试降级。如果对方问了一个合理的问题，你就要合理地回答。这就是预期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, I can only speak to conducting the traffic stop from my perspective as a police officer. What is our policy? What is our training? Number one, you approach the driver. You introduce yourself by rank, by name, by what agency you work for. And you tell the person, explain why the person is being stopped. You do these sorts of things to try and ensure one number one to identify yourself but to try and ensure a level of professionalism and to try and deescalate. If the person asks you a question that's reasonable, you respond to it reasonably. Like that is the expectation.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 那名 ICE 特工做了这些吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And did the ICE agent do any of that?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 就我记忆所及，没有。而且现场似乎很混乱。我不确定，但似乎是另一个人在喊让她下车，而不是开枪的那名官员。我不清楚他们两人是否在协作，是否理解对方想要达成什么目的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: My recollection is that any of that and further it just seems like there's confusion and I I don't know just from what I recall but it seems like someone else is saying to get out of the car than the officer who shot and I just it's not clear to me whether the two of them were working together and understood what each other was trying to accomplish.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你觉得如果这件事完全由 **MPD**（明尼阿波利斯警察局）而不是 ICE 处理，结局会有所不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Do you feel that this would have ended differently had this been handled entirely by the MPD, not ICE?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: No question.

</details>

### 调查权的博弈与未来展望

**Michael Barbaro**: 考虑到警务工作的瞬息万变，你对那名 ICE 官员有同情心吗？撇开他是否应该站在车前不谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Do you have any empathy for the ICE officer given the splitsecond nature of of policing? Putting aside whether he should have ever been in front of the car.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的，绝对有。执法部门的领导者对下属负有义务。我们有义务确保我们的警员拥有足够的政策支持、足够的培训和足够的经验来应对我们让他们面临的挑战。我们有义务不把他们派出去并告诉他们“你今天有特定的配额，必须抓到一定数量的人”。在专业警务中，这种做法很久以前就被废弃了。考虑到这名特工不久前在一次拦截中受过重伤，这肯定会让人质疑该机构采取了什么措施来保护他们的成员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes, absolutely. Law enforcement leaders, executives have an obligation to their people. We have an obligation to ensure that our people have sufficient policies, sufficient training, sufficient experiences for the challenges that we are placing them into. We have an obligation not to send our people out there and to tell them, you know, you have a specific quota today. You have to get a certain number of people. I mean, it seems like that's the situation these folks are being placed into. And that went out the window a long time ago in professional policing. And considering this agent was seriously injured in a stop, you know, somewhat recently, it certainly raises questions as to what did the agency do to protect their person.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 你是指这名官员曾卷入一次拦截，被车拖行并受了重伤。你基本上是在质疑 ICE 特工是否接受了足够的培训来处理这类遭遇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: You're you're referring to the fact that I believe this officer in the Times has written about it was involved in a stop where he was dragged in a car. Yes. He sustained significant bodily injury. For sure. So what did the agency do to ensure that that officer would not be unsafe in similar situations? Right. I mean, you were basically raising questions about whether ICE agents are sufficiently trained to handle these kinds of encounters.

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 是的。据报道，他们甚至没有得到以前那种水平的培训，培训时间变短了。我认为这令人担忧。他们正被迫进入一些他们并未准备好应对的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Yes. And whether or not... I don't have specific information about that. I just know what I've read. I know what's been reported. It's been reported that they're not even getting the level of training that they used to get. That the the time of training is less. I think that's concerning. And I do think they are being forced into situations in which they are not well prepared to deal with.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 谈谈调查。联邦政府阻止了地方官员参与调查，理由是市长 **Jacob Frey** 的言论导致地方官员无法保持客观。另一方面，特朗普政府则表示 Renee Good 负有全部责任，ICE 官员没有任何过错。那么，他们能保持客观吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Let me turn to the investigation and I want to ask you about two issues that have arisen with this investigation. The first of course is that the federal government has blocked local officials from participating in the investigation and they basically argue that because of comments made by your boss, Mayor Jacob Fry, that local officials can't be objective. On the other hand, you've got the Trump administration out there basically saying, you know, Renee Good is entirely at fault and the ICE officer did nothing wrong here. So, can they be objective? I mean, h how are you making sense of what has become an incredibly messy and contentious situation over what I normally think of as everybody doing joint investigations of of a tragic situation?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我认为这里的损失是人们对调查合法性的任何信任。但我相信 **FBI** 仍会进行彻底的调查，因为那是他们的职责，是那里的工作人员每天都在做的事情。但明尼阿波利斯的居民会相信这是一次严肃的调查吗？这就是问题所在。这种处理方式剥夺了调查在许多人心中的合法性，这非常不幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: Well, I think the loss here is the loss of any trust that the investigation would be legitimate. M and I tell you, I know a lot of the FBI agents here. I believe the FBI will still do a thorough investigation cuz that's what they do. That's what the people who staff this agency here, that's what they do every day. But will Minneapolis residents believe that it's a serious investigation? But that's the problem. The way this has played out has taken all sense of legitimacy away from many people, and that's very unfortunate.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 局长，你是否担心这一切会抹杀你过去四年多来为重建社区对明尼阿波利斯警察局信任所做的工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: If this escalates, are you worried, Chief O'Hara, that all of this is just going to erase the work you've done over the past four plus years to rebuild and repair the community's trust in the Minneapolis Police Department?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我最担心的首要任务是，这会抹杀我们在重建部门和减少犯罪方面取得的成果。2020 年 6 月，在城市遭到破坏、警察局被焚烧后，那一个月发生的枪击案几乎相当于过去半年的总量。犯罪率一直居高不下，直到过去两年才开始下降，而且是在警力不足的情况下下降的。我们终于开始重建，我担心如果再次发生大规模动乱，犯罪率会再次剧增，部门会出现新一轮的人才流失，我们无法承受这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: The number one priority that I worry about in terms of erasing work that we've done is ultimately erasing the gains that we've made rebuilding the department and being able to reduce crime. Mhm. You know, in June of 2020, immediately after the destruction of the city, the burning of a police station here, in that one month, we had about as many shootings in one month as the city used to have in half a year. And that level of crime stayed very high. And you know, now the last couple of years has started to come down. And it's come down despite not having enough officers. and we finally have started to rebuild and I'm just afraid if we have another large-scale unrest that we are go both going to have a dramatic increase in crime yet again that's predictable as well as another mass exodus of the department and we just we we cannot sustain that.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 最后，你认为如何才能回到一个更简单的时期，让你专注于改革和修复警民关系？在你看来，ICE 和边境巡逻队这些联邦特工是否需要离开这个城市，你才能做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Just to end this conversation, Chief, how do you think you get back to a simpler time in your policing where you can be focused on the reforms that you brought to the city on repairing relations between police and the community? And in your mind, does ICE, does Border Patrol, do all these federal agents need to leave the city for you to do that?

</details>

**Brian O'Hara**: 我认为每个人都想恢复某种常态。这涉及回归一些我们公认的基础。这显然不是说联邦执法部门停止执行联邦法律，那不是答案。但它确实需要关于现实的诚实对话。我们遇到过很多次美国公民被 ICE 拦截的情况，甚至包括警察的家属。这充其量也是非常值得商榷的。他们没有去拦截挪威裔或爱尔兰裔的家属，这种事没发生。

我们现在正在证明，这种共存是可能的。我们正在向世界证明，这已经不是 5 年、10 年或 15 年前的那个警察局了。但这对参与其中的每个人来说都是难以置信的压力。我认为每个人都需要“**降降温**”（turn the heat down），希望一些基本的东西能回归常态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian O'Hara**: I mean, I think everybody wants to get back to some sense of normaly and I think that does involve some level of returning to some basic things that we accepted as normal. You know, that obviously isn't federal law enforcement stops enforcing federal law. That's not the answer either. But it does have to do with having an honest conversation about reality. We've had many instances of people being stopped, family members of police officers being stopped that are American citizens by ICE. Yeah, it's definitely at best it is definitely questionable. They're not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish. That's not happening. Hm. Just to return to that question, can your work at its best coexist with the work of a organization like ICE? We are doing it right now and we are proving to the world that this is possible. That this is not the same police department it was 5 years ago or 10 years ago or 15 years ago. But it is an unbelievable stress on everyone involved. And I think everybody needs to turn the heat down and hopefully get some sense of normaly some basic things to return.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 局长，非常感谢你抽出时间。

<details>

**Michael Barbaro**: Chief, thank you very much for your time. We really appreciate it.

### 今日其他要闻

**Michael Barbaro**: 以下是今天你需要了解的其他新闻。随着大规模反政府抗议活动在周末席卷**伊朗**，伊朗总统誓言要解决国家的经济问题，但没有表现出停止严厉镇压示威者的迹象。活动人士称，过去几天镇压可能已导致多达 200 人死亡。与此同时，特朗普政府警告伊朗领导人，如果政权继续杀害和平抗议者，美国可能会打击伊朗。

此外，特朗普政府正在升级与联邦储备委员会主席 **Jerome Powell** 的长期不和，对他展开刑事调查。调查的核心是鲍威尔是否在联储总部数英里美元的翻修工程范围问题上对国会撒谎。但特朗普与鲍威尔的原始冲突源于鲍威尔不愿按特朗普的要求大幅降息。鲍威尔在周日晚间发布的视频中强调，刑事指控的威胁是美联储根据对公众最有利的评估而非遵循总统偏好来设定利率的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Here's what else you need to know today. As massive anti-government protests spread across Iran over the weekend, Iran's president vowed to address the country's economic problems, but showed no signs of backing off a harsh crackdown on demonstrators. That crackdown, activists say, may have killed as many as 200 people over the past few days. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is warning Iran's leaders that it could strike Iran if the regime continues to kill peaceful protesters. And the Trump administration is escalating its longunning feud with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, by opening a criminal investigation into his conduct. The investigation centers around whether Powell lied to Congress about the scope of a multibillion dollar renovation project of the Fed's headquarters. But Trump's original conflict with Powell stems from his unwillingness to significantly slash interest rates as President Trump had demanded. A reality that Powell highlighted in a video released on Sunday night. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.
