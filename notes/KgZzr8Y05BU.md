### 互联网的悖论：长尾理论的落空

最初，互联网被寄予厚望，人们认为它将打破传统媒体行业的壁垒，降低创作和传播成本，从而促进**长尾理论（Long Tail Theory: 指互联网时代，由于存储和分发成本降低，使得大量小众产品能够聚集起来，形成巨大的市场规模）**的实现。 Wired杂志主编Chris Anderson曾预言，互联网将赋能小众创作者，削弱大型工作室的权力，实现文化的民主化。然而，现实却与预期背道而驰，2025年，大制作的续集、翻拍和重制版作品占据了市场主导地位，似乎创意已经停滞不前。这种现象引发了人们对互联网文化发展方向的深刻反思。

Okay.
It's official 2025 was the year.
Creativity seemingly died.
The bestselling movies
like Zootopia to Jurassic World and
Mission Impossible eight were all sequels,
or they were remasters like Lilo
and Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon.
Similarly, the best selling video games
battlefield six, Borderlands
four, Madden 26 were all big franchises
or remasters like Oblivion Remastered.
Meanwhile, names
that we've seen for decades like Lady
Gaga, Billie Eilish and Bruno Mars
once again dominated the music charts.
And now 2025 was not an exceptional year
in that regard.
Take a look at this chart.
30 years ago,
only about one quarter of the top 20
movies were sequels,
spinoffs, prequels, or remakes.
Now it's close to 90%.
Similarly,
almost all of the top selling video games
now come from established franchises.
Even books show this very same trend.
The share of top selling titles
written by an already famous
author is increasing each year.
But wasn't
the internet supposed to do the opposite?
In the early 2000s, wired
editor in chief Chris Anderson
famously predicted that as the internet
made it cheaper and cheaper
to send songs, movies and games
to customers around the world,
this would enable niche creators to rise,
while it would cause big studios
to become less powerful.
This theory, the theory of the long
tail, was a beautiful idea
the democratization of culture.
So what went wrong?

### 传统媒体的“守门人”经济学

在互联网普及之前，媒体行业受到“守门人”经济学的制约。创作者想要获得成功，必须克服重重障碍。首先，他们需要昂贵的录音设备和后期制作技术；其次，他们需要依赖唱片厂、电影公司等机构进行内容分发，而这些机构往往拥有有限的货架空间和媒体资源，因此，创作者必须与这些机构建立良好关系，或者通过获得广播时间来证明自己的受欢迎程度。这种层层筛选机制扼杀了许多潜在的优秀作品，即使像J.K.罗琳的《哈利·波特》和披头士乐队，也曾遭遇过多次拒绝。

As always on Monday macro
for this video, we, a team of economists,
went deep into the economic literature
and summarized all the key insights
that can explain why big budget sequels
are bigger than ever today.
And we ask a question
if the rise of sequels reduced creativity
or if there's actually
a thriving long tail of amazing
niche content that you just don't know
about hiding below the surface.
But to answer these questions,
we first need to understand how the media
industry used to work the gatekeeper
economics of the pre-Internet media.
Let's go back to the 1980s.
Now imagine you were a singer and wanted
to earn a living with your passion.
The odds would be stacked against you
from the very beginning.
First, you needed a studio
filled with super expensive equipment
to record your song.
Second, to distribute your song,
you needed a factory to press records.
Third, these records then needed to be
distributed to thousands of record shops.
These record shops had limited
shelf space, so to convince shops to sell
your record, you needed to have
an existing relationship
or prove you were already popular
by getting airtime on the radio,
for which again,
you also needed the right connections.
Be short before asking consumers
if they like their content.
Aspiring creators
first had to convince gatekeepers
like record labels to give them a shot.
If granted funding, they could record
and distribute their music.
This system did produce many, many songs,
movies, and games that actually sold
really well and were loved
by both consumers and critics.
However, as you can imagine,
this extra layer
killed a lot of films, games, and music
that we would have loved.
In fact,
some of our most beloved cultural icons
almost got stuck with the gatekeepers.
For example, J.K.
Rowling's Harry Potter book
was first rejected by 12 publishers before
it was published by Bloomsbury,
and even the Beatles were rejected
by nearly every major label
in Europe before producer
George Martin finally signed them in 1962.

### 数字革命的双刃剑：分发成本降低与超级明星经济

数字革命彻底改变了媒体行业，主要体现在两个方面。首先，互联网使得内容分发成本几乎为零，歌曲和电影不再需要压制成CD或DVD，也不再需要通过实体店销售，只需点击几下，即可下载到iPod或笔记本电脑。其次，数字技术大幅降低了艺术创作的成本，人们可以使用iPhone拍摄电影，使用廉价的麦克风和软件录制音乐，从而绕过传统的发行渠道，实现自我资助和在线分发。然而，随着数字化进程的推进，一种新的经济模式——**超级明星经济（Superstar Economics: 指在某些市场中，少数顶尖的个体能够获得不成比例的收益和关注）**——开始显现。全球化和互联网的普及使得消费者能够接触到最好的游戏、音乐和电影，从而导致顶尖艺术家成为超级明星，而普通艺术家则逐渐被边缘化。

So, of course,
when one the cost of recording equipment
fell lower and lower, and two the internet
made distribution costs almost zero.
Anderson's long term prediction
about the rise of niche media
and the fall of big, safe
blockbusters made total sense.
Yet here we are today
with more blockbusters than ever.
So again, what happened
to the fall of the gatekeepers?
The digital revolution would revolutionize
the media industry into main ways.
First, the internet made distribution
almost free.
Overnight music and movies
no longer had to be pressed onto CDs
or DVDs, or sold in physical stores
with a few clicks,
songs and films could be downloaded
straight into an iPod or a laptop.
But at first, gatekeepers
trying to hold back change.
However, after piracy, platforms
like Napster, The Pirate Bay and others
devastated the revenue in all creative
and especially the music industry.
Record labels, publishers and others
increasingly brought their content
to legal online distribution platforms
like Spotify, Netflix and Steam.
Second, digital technologies dramatically
reduced the cost of creating art.
Suddenly, you could shoot a movie
on your iPhone or record music
in a home studio using inexpensive
microphones and software.
This allowed many artists
to self-fund their work and distribute it
online to millions of people, effectively
bypassing traditional gatekeepers.

### 全球化与风险规避：大制作的必然选择

全球化进一步加剧了超级明星经济的影响。随着英语在全球范围内的传播，以及亚洲等地区经济的崛起，好莱坞的票房收入逐渐从国内市场转向国际市场。为了在全球市场取得成功，电影、游戏和书籍等文化产品需要具备视觉冲击力、熟悉的故事框架和家喻户晓的明星。由于制作顶尖内容成本高昂，投资者倾向于选择安全可靠的续集和翻拍作品，以降低风险。因此，尽管独立创作蓬勃发展，但大制作商业产品仍然占据了市场主导地位。

So yes, in the early days of the internet,
the long tail looked to be coming true.
As you can see here in these graphs
by economic professor Joel Wold Fogel,
the number of new songs added each year
rose from about 50,000 in 1988
to nearly 350,000 by 2007.
Meanwhile, the number of US made
original films also exploded,
along with self-published book titles
and television shows.
So the first part of Anderson's prediction
actually seems to have been through
far lower production costs
and cheap distribution
have led to an explosion in creativity.
The long tail is there,
but while the number of songs, movies
and shows exploded,
people increasingly spend their money
on consuming sequels and franchises.
Rather than these products.
But why?
