### 量子力学的百年困惑

**Sean Carroll**: 量子力学很奇怪，因为尽管我们现在正在庆祝它的百年诞辰，但我们仍然不理解它。在我们这个最好、最重要的基础物理学框架中，到底发生了什么？我们基于量子引力理解了地球为何绕太阳转，或者苹果为何从树上掉下来，但我们不理解当引力变得强大时，比如在黑洞中或大爆炸附近会发生什么。所以，基本上，大自然利用它能想到的一切技巧，以有趣的方式让物理学发挥作用，而最终，弄清楚这一切确实能给物理学家带来成就感。我是**肖恩·卡罗尔**，约翰·霍普金斯大学的物理学家和哲学家，**Mindscape播客**的主持人，也是多本书的作者，最近的作品是**《宇宙中最大的思想》**系列，包括**《空间、时间和运动》**和**《量子与场》**。

**Sean Carroll**: Quantum mechanics is weird because despite the fact that we're celebrating its 100th anniversary right now, we still don't understand it. What is really going on in this our best, most important framework for doing fundamental physics? We understand on the basis of quantum gravity why the earth moves around the sun or apples fall from trees, but we don't understand what happens when gravity becomes strong like in a black hole or near the big bang. So basically, nature uses every trick that it can think of to make physics work in interesting ways, and it really does give physicists a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day to figure it all out. I'm **Sean Carroll**. I'm a Physicist and Philosopher at **Johns Hopkins University**, Host of the **Mindscape Podcast** and also author of a bunch of books, most recently "**The Biggest Ideas in the Universe**" series, including "**Space, Time and Motion**" and "**Quanta and Fields**".

### 量子力学的历史演进

**Sean Carroll**: 我想，如果你是1895年左右的物理学家，也就是19世纪末，你可能会被原谅，因为你认为我们几乎快要成功了。我们几乎掌握了完整的自然理论，因为他们有粒子的概念，对吧？你知道，原子这个概念在19世纪对很多物理学家来说有点模糊，但他们最终接受了，并开始意识到原子是由其他粒子组成的，比如质子、中子、电子等等。然后，构成物质的粒子被场推动着，比如电场、磁场、引力场等等。所以，你有了这种两部分的和谐：物质由粒子组成，力来自场。未来物理学的所有努力都将是弄清楚所有粒子是什么，所有场是什么？然后你就大功告成了。当时地平线上有几朵乌云。其中一个最终是**相对论**。**麦克斯韦电磁理论**的对称性与**牛顿经典力学理论**的对称性不同。但另一个问题是，物质和材料的某些特性似乎说不通。现在我将跳过历史，快进到1911年左右。他们正在构建你一直看到的原子图景，对吧？原子中心有一个小原子核，电子像行星绕恒星一样围绕它旋转。这被称为**卢瑟福原子模型**，以杰出的实验和理论物理学家**欧内斯特·卢瑟福**命名。这个想法被接受了，人们喜欢电子像小行星一样的想法，但他们立刻发现这不可能正确，因为围绕原子核运行的电子会发出电磁波。它是一个运动的粒子。运动的带电粒子会发光。你现在看到的所有光都来自某个运动中的电子。所以你可以计算。你可以说，如果电子绕原子核轨道运动，如果它发光，它就会失去能量并螺旋式地坠入原子核。这需要多长时间？答案是，宇宙中的每个原子，包括你坐的椅子上的原子，甚至你身体里的原子，都应该在百亿分之一秒内坍缩成一个点。所以这显然没有发生。电子像太阳系中的小行星一样的想法是错误的。这一点以及其他事情，比如**黑体辐射**和其他实验结果，使人们相信粒子和力之间没有这种清晰的划分。他们说，光（本应是波）具有粒子般的特性，**爱因斯坦**说过。粒子（如电子）具有波般的特性，**路易·德布罗意**在**尼尔斯·玻尔**等人的工作之后也说过。所有这些在几乎正好100年前的1925年汇聚成了**量子力学**理论。几乎在同一时间，出现了两个不同的版本。**维尔纳·海森堡**提出了他的版本，称为**矩阵力学**。**埃尔温·薛定谔**提出了他的版本，称为**波动力学**。他们证明了它们实际上在数学上是等价的，但我喜欢说量子力学是物理学史上两大思想中的第二个。物理学中的第一个大思想是**经典力学**。**相对论**是一个相当大的思想，但不如**经典力学**或第二个大思想**量子力学**那么大。**量子力学**抛弃了**经典力学**，用非常不同的东西取而代之。它说电子既不是粒子也不是波。它们在你看它们之前表现得像波，然后当你观察它们时，它们又表现得像粒子。这是一个非常非常难以接受的事情，物理学家们仍在努力弄清楚如何理解它。阅读这些思想发展史是如此有趣，因为今天我们只被教导最终结果，但你知道，在早期，他们并不知道发生了什么。

**Sean Carroll**: I'd like to think if you were a physicist, circa 1895, okay? The very end of the 19th century, you would've been forgiven for thinking that we were almost there. We were almost having a complete theory of nature in our grasp, because they had the idea of particles, right? You know, the idea of an atom was a little bit sketchy to a lot of physicists in the 1800s, but they eventually caught on and they were beginning to realize that atoms were made of other particles, protons, neutrons, electrons and so forth. And then the particles, which make up matter, are pushed around by fields, by the electric field, by the magnetic field, by the gravitational field and so forth. So you have this sort of two-part harmony. Matter is made of particles, forces come from fields, and the all of the effort in the future of physics would be figuring out what are all the particles, what are all the fields? And then you'd be done. There were a couple of clouds on the horizon. One of them ended up being **relativity**. The fact that the symmetries of **Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism** were different than the symmetries of **Newton's theory of classical mechanics**. But the others were that there were certain properties of matter and materials that didn't quite seem to make sense. And I'm gonna be a historical now. Let's pop forward to like 1911. They were putting together the picture of the atom that is the cartoon you've always seen, right? There's a little nucleus at the center of the atom, and electrons are circling around it like planets orbiting a star. This is called the **Rutherford Atom Model** after **Ernest Rutherford**, who was a brilliant experimental and theoretical physicist. And this was entertained and people liked the idea that electrons were kind of like little planets, but they instantly figured out it can't possibly be right, because that electron orbiting the nucleus would give off electromagnetic waves. It's a moving particle. Moving charged particles give off light. All of the light you're looking at right now came from some electron in motion moving around. So you can calculate. You can say if the electron is moving around in orbit around the atomic nucleus, if it gives off light, it will lose energy and spiral into the nucleus. How long should that take? And the answer is, every atom in the universe, including the ones in the chair you're sitting on, or even in your own body, should collapse to a point in a hundredth of a billionth of a second. So that clearly does not happen. The idea that electrons are like little planets in a solar system is just wrong. And this and other things, **black body radiation** and other experimental results convinced people that there wasn't this clean division between particles and forces. They said there's aspects of light, which is supposed to be a wave, which are particle-like, **Einstein** said that. There are aspects of particles like electrons that are wave-like. **Louis de Broglie** following work by **Niels Bohr** and others said that. And this whole thing coalesces almost exactly 100 years ago in 1925 in the theory of **quantum mechanics**. And almost right at the same time, two different versions of it came out. **Werner Heisenberg** had his version called **matrix mechanics**. **Erwin Schrödinger** had his version called **wave mechanics**. They show that they were actually mathematically equivalent, but **quantum mechanics**, I like to say it was the second of two big ideas in the history of physics. The first big idea in physics was **classical mechanics**. **Relativity** is a pretty big idea, but not as big as **classical mechanics** or the second big idea, which is **quantum mechanics**. **Quantum mechanics** throws away **classical mechanics** and replaces it with something very different. It says that electrons are not particles or waves. They act like waves until you look at them and then they look like particles. That is a very, very difficult thing to swallow, and physicists are still trying to figure out what to make of it. It's so much fun reading the history of how these ideas developed, 'cause today we're just taught the final result, but you know, they didn't know what was going on back in the early days.

### 波函数与测量问题

**Sean Carroll**: 1926年，**埃尔温·薛定谔**提出了一个方程，我们现在称之为**波函数**。这是一个非常重要概念的愚蠢名称。所以，想象那个小电子不是在一个圆圈中运行，而是一个波。它在原子中心周围有一个轮廓。这个方程运行得非常好。它仍然是我们今天使用的方程，但你必须问一个半哲学性的问题：**波函数**是什么？它告诉我们什么？**薛定谔**认为，好吧，在某些情况下，电子表现得像波。在其他情况下，它们表现得像粒子。也许这个方程说，如果你从一个完全展开的电子波开始，它会自行局域化到某个点附近，然后看起来像一个粒子。结果证明并非如此。方程不关心你的感受。事实恰恰相反。如果你从一个局域化的电子波开始，它会扩散到各地。所以，是另一位物理学家**马克斯·玻恩**（与**尼尔斯·玻尔**不同）指出了思考**薛定谔波函数**的正确方式。他说，想想当你测量电子的某个属性时会发生什么，比如它的位置或速度，或者你想测量的任何东西。他说：“**波函数**的作用是告诉我获得不同测量结果的概率。”特别是，如果你想了解数学，你将**波函数**平方，这会告诉你电子出现在某个地方的概率。这在各种原因下都显得奇怪和疯狂。人们根本不喜欢概率参与其中的想法。当然，当你抛硬币时会有概率，但这只是因为你不知道关于硬币的一切。从**牛顿**和**拉普拉斯**时代起，我们认为物理学深层是完全确定性的。而**马克斯·玻恩**却说，不，它不是。这很难接受。但另一个难以接受的事情是，为什么测量或观察某物的想法会出现在物理学的基本定律中？这以前从未发生过。当然，你必须考虑测量和观察事物，但人们总是认为，如果我测量行星的位置或类似的东西，原则上，我可以在不以任何方式干扰系统的情况下，完全无害地进行测量。而**玻恩**说的是，当你测量一个电子时，你会立即且剧烈地改变它的**波函数**。根据后来被称为**哥本哈根诠释**的量子力学（以**尼尔斯·玻尔**和**维尔纳·海森堡**等人工作的城市命名），物理学的基本定律的一部分是一套规则，它规定了当你测量一个系统的属性时会发生什么。所以，**量子力学**是物理学史上唯一一个包含测量结果规则，并且测量在其定律中扮演重要角色的理论。如果你问，测量是什么？什么才算数？我必须有意识吗？摄像机可以进行测量吗？答案是，我们不会告诉你答案。我们没有一套公认的测量发生标准。这被巧妙地称为**量子力学的测量问题**。对此有各种合理的解决方案，但我们尚未就哪个是正确的达成一致。

**Sean Carroll**: In 1926, **Erwin Schrödinger** presents an equation, what we now call the **wave function**. It's a dopey name for a very important idea. So think of that little electron instead of orbiting in a circle, it's a wave. It has a profile around the center of the atom. And the equation works very well. It's still the equation that we use today, but then you have to ask, okay, semi-philosophical question, what is the **wave function**? What is it telling us? And **Schrödinger** thought, well, okay, in some cases, electrons act like waves. In other cases they act like particles. Maybe the equation says that if you start with an electron wave all spread out, it will sort of localize itself near some point and it will look like a particle. Turns out not to be true. The equations don't care about your feelings. It's the opposite. If you start out with a localized electron wave, it will spread out all over the place. So it was yet another physicist, **Max Born**, different than **Niels Bohr**, who pointed out the right way to think about **Schrödinger's wave function**. He said, think about what happens when you measure a property of the electron, like its position or its velocity or whatever you wanna measure. He says, "What the **wave function** is doing is it's telling me the probability of getting a different measurement outcome." In particular, if you want the math, you square the **wave function**, that tells you the probability of seeing the electron somewhere. And this was just bizarre and crazy for all sorts of reasons. People didn't like the idea probabilities were involved at all. Of course there's probabilities when you flip a coin, but that's just 'cause you just don't know everything there is to know about the coin. Since the time of **Newton** and **Laplace**, we thought that physics deep down was perfectly deterministic. And here's **Max Born** saying, no, it's not. That was difficult to swallow. But the other thing that's difficult to swallow is why in the world is the idea of measuring or observing something, showing up in the fundamental laws of physics? That had never happened before. Of course you have to think about measuring things and observing things, but it was always imagined that if I measure the position of a planet or something like that, in principle, I can do that measurement completely benignly without disturbing the system in any way at all. And what **Born** is saying is that when you measure an electron, you instantly and dramatically change its **wave function**. And to tell me what the fundamental laws of physics are, according to what became known as the **Copenhagen interpretation** of **quantum mechanics** after the city where **Niels Bohr** and **Werner Heisenberg** and others were doing their work, part of those fundamental laws are a set of rules that say, here's what's happen, what happens when you measure the properties of a system. So **quantum mechanics** is the only theory in the history of physics that has rules about measurement outcomes and has measurement playing an important role in what those laws are. And if you ask, well, what is a measurement? What counts? Do I have to be conscious? Can a video camera do a measurement? The answer is we're not gonna tell you the answer to that. We don't have an agreed upon set of criteria for when a measurement happens. And this is known cleverly as the **measurement problem** of **quantum mechanics**. There's various plausible resolutions to it, but we don't agree on what the right one is.

### 波函数的可视化与量子纠缠

**Sean Carroll**: 在物理学中，学习物理、教授物理、从事物理，可视化事物非常有帮助，无论是精确地还是以某种玩具般的比喻方式。但我们必须记住，并非所有事物都必须有准确的可视化方式。我们必须接受世界并非为了让我们轻松而存在。所以，当谈到**量子力学**的**波函数**时，我们有点卡壳。有一些简单的情况。比如，如果你只有一个电子，没有其他粒子，你谈论的是一个电子的**波函数**，你实际上可以将其可视化。如果你为了方便生活，将空间视为二维，那么**波函数**就是一个函数。你有点作弊，因为它不是一个值，而是一个复数，这意味着一个实部加上“i”乘以一个虚部，其中“i”的平方是负一。但没关系，谁在乎呢？你需要知道的是有一个轮廓，有一个形状。基本上，空间中的每个点都有一个值，它表示“这是电子在空间中每个点的**波函数**”。所以，尽管去可视化它吧。如果你上过化学课，看到过原子中被称为**轨道**的图像，那些实际上就是**波函数**的图片。它们是电子在原子中可以采取的不同形状的**波函数**的值。但只是为了告诉你宇宙不会总是对你那么友好，有时你有两个你关心的电子。**量子力学**最深刻的特征之一，也是它与**经典力学**区别开来的地方，就是你没有一个电子的**波函数**和另一个电子的独立**波函数**，因为请记住，**波函数**的作用是说明“我测量某物的概率是多少？”对吧？所以当我有两个电子时，我可以知道在宇宙中任何地方看到一个电子的概率，我也可以知道在宇宙中任何地方看到另一个电子的概率，但它们可以是相互关联的。也许我知道这两个电子相距一厘米，但我不知道它们在哪里，对吧？如果我测量其中一个，那么我立刻就知道另一个在哪里。但我事先不知道它们中的任何一个在哪里。这种现象被称为**量子纠缠**，它的意思是，与其为每个粒子拥有一个独立的**波函数**，这会意味着它们之间没有联系，不如说**波函数**同时告诉我两个粒子的概率。从数学上讲，如果你想要细节，你为每对位置分配一个复数，即粒子一的位置和粒子二的位置。你想可视化它吗？祝你好运。你除非能可视化六维空间中的复函数，否则你无法真正做到。但它实际上就是这样。我们可以把它写下来，我们可以处理它，如果我们真的想可视化事物，我们可以回到只有一个电子时事物的样子，但在某个时候，我们必须相信方程知道它们在做什么。

**Sean Carroll**: Very often in physics, learning physics, teaching physics, doing physics, it's very helpful to visualize things, either precisely or maybe in some toy kind of metaphorical way of doing things. But we have to keep in mind it's not necessary that there be an accurate way to visualize certain things. We have to accept that the world is not here to make things easy for us. So when it comes to the **wave function** of **quantum mechanics**, we're a little bit stuck. There are simple cases. Like if you have one electron and that's it, no other particles, you're talking about the **wave function** of one electron, you can actually visualize that. If you just think about space as two dimensional to make your life easy, the **wave function** is a function. You're cheating a little bit because rather than having a value, it's a complex number that means to say a real part plus 'i' times an imaginary part where 'i' is squared to minus one. But okay, who cares? What you need to know is there's a profile, there's a shape. There's basically a value at every point in space which says, this is the **wave function** of the electron at every point in space. So go ahead and visualize it. If you ever took chemistry class and you saw those images of what are called **orbitals** in different kinds of atoms, those are literally pictures of **wave functions**. Those are values of the **wave functions** of different shapes, the **wave function** of an electron can take in an atom. But just to show you that the universe is not gonna always go that easy on you, sometimes you have two electrons that you care about. And one of the most profound features of **quantum mechanics**, which separates it from **classical mechanics** is that you don't have a **wave function** for electron one and a separate **wave function** for electron two, because remember, the job of the **wave function** is to say, what is the probability that I measure something? Right? So when I have two electrons, I can have the probability of seeing one electron anywhere in the universe, and I also have the probability I see the other one everywhere in the universe, but they can be connected. Maybe I know that the electrons are one centimeter apart, but I don't know where they are, right? If I measure one of them, then I instantly know where the other one is. But I don't know ahead of time where either one of them are. This is the phenomenon called **entanglement**, and what it means is that rather than having one separate **wave function** for one particle and a distinct one for the other one, which would mean there's no connection between them, the **wave function** tells me the probability of both particles at once. Mathematically, if you want the details, you assign a complex number to every pair of positions, the position of particle one and the position of particle two. You want to visualize that? Good luck. You're not really gonna be able to do it unless you can visualize complex functions in six-dimensional space. But that's what it actually is. We can write it down and we can deal with it, and we can go back to what things look like when it's just one electron if we wanna really wanna visualize things, but at some point we have to trust that the equations know what they're doing.

### 量子性与量子场论

**Sean Carroll**: 你可能会从“**量子力学**”这个名字中认为它与“**量子**”有关，**量子**是一个用来表示离散量的词。这源于**量子力学**发明早期，当辐射来自热辐射体或原子周围轨道上的电子时，你可以观察到离散的可能能量。光在某些频率下被气体吸收，而在其他频率下则不被吸收。当电子在原子内部改变能量时，它会从一个能量状态跳到另一个能量状态，中间没有连续的演变。所以，就有了从一个状态到另一个状态的**量子跃迁**的概念，但这种离散性并非**量子力学**的根本。它不是内置的。这并不是因为**量子力学**说世界是离散的，由像素组成，或者坐落在格子上之类的。恰恰相反。**量子力学**是一个波的故事，但有时波只以某些离散的频率振动。想想一根两端固定的弦，比如吉他或小提琴上的弦。你可以拨动弦，根据弦的张力和两端之间的距离，它会振动，发出特定的音符，但同一根弦也能以两倍的频率振动。有基频，弦作为一个整体上下振动；还有下一个泛音，它在不同侧面半振动。然后是谐波系列，弦可以以某种方式振动，所以它先向上，然后向下，再向上。那是三倍，依此类推。所以，一组离散的可能频率是由连续弦的振动产生的。同样，连续的**波函数**在某些情况下只能以某些离散的频率振动。这就是为什么电子在原子中具有离散能量的原因。现在，**量子力学**是一个框架，就像**经典力学**一样。**经典力学**不说明世界是由什么组成的。它给你基本规则，然后你选择，哦，世界是由粒子或流体或其他什么组成的，以及作用在它们上的力。然后你把这些代入**经典力学**的框架。**量子力学**也是如此。当你第一次接触**量子力学**时，你谈论的大部分内容，比如电子和光子，你都在将**量子力学**的规则应用于粒子。但我们至少从**麦克斯韦**时代就知道，也存在场，对吧？有电场、磁场、引力场，也许还有其他场。所以我们也可以将**量子力学**的规则应用于场。结果，我们得到了所谓的**量子场论**。**量子场论**不是**量子力学**的替代或改进。它只是将**量子力学**的规则应用于场而不是粒子。发生的情况是，你取一个场，所以场与粒子相反。粒子有一个位置，场存在于任何地方，但在每个点都有一个值。所以电场是空间中每个点的一个小箭头，有方向和长度。然后你说，好吧，那是一个场。我将把**量子力学**的规则应用于它。所以我将为场发明一个**波函数**，然后我会说，场以某种方式做某些事情的概率是多少？数学计算就像原子中的电子一样。场有某些离散的振动频率，这在粒子物理实验中表现为粒子。场稍微振动一下，你认为你看到一个粒子。如果场振动更多一点，现在你认为你看到两个粒子，你可以在两边精确地匹配数学描述。所以，**量子力学**早期这个谜团的解决方案是：为什么电子或光子有时表现得像粒子，有时表现得像波？答案是第一，它们是波。它们就是波。它们是场中的波。不仅有电场、磁场，还有电子场对应电子粒子。有中微子场，有夸克场，一切都由场组成。但第二，当你将**量子力学**的规则应用于场时，它们在我们的实验中表现得像粒子。这就是为什么它解释了这种区别：当我们不观察它们时，事物表现得像波；当我们观察它们时，它们以粒子的形式出现在我们面前。

**Sean Carroll**: You would think from the name **quantum mechanics** that **quantum mechanics** has something to do with **quantum**, which is a word made up to denote a discreet amount of stuff. It comes from the fact that in the early days of inventing **quantum mechanics**, when you had radiation coming from hot radiating bodies or when you had electrons in orbits around atoms, there were discreet possible energies you could observe. Light is absorbed at certain frequencies by gas and not at other frequencies. When an electron changes energies inside an atom, it goes from a certain energy to another one without being in between, without sort of continuously evolving from one energy to another. So there was this idea of a **quantum jump** from one state to another, but that discreetness is not fundamental to **quantum mechanics**. It's not built in. It's not because **quantum mechanics** says the world is discreet, it's made of pixels, it's sit on a lattice or anything like that. It's because the opposite. **Quantum mechanics** is a story of waves, but sometimes waves only vibrate with certain discreet sets of frequencies. Think of a string attached at two ends, like on a guitar or a violin or whatever. You can pluck the string, and given the tension of the string and the distance between the ends, it will vibrate, it will give you a certain note, but the same string is also able to vibrate at twice the frequency. There's the fundamental frequency where the string vibrates as a whole up and down, and there is the next overtone where it sort of vibrates half and half on different sides. And then a harmonic series, there's a way that the string can vibrate, so it goes up and then down and up again. That's three times, and so on. So a discreet set of possible frequencies comes out of the motion of a continuous string vibrating. And likewise, the continuous **wave function** in certain circumstances can only vibrate with certain discreet frequencies. And so that's why electrons have discreet energies in atoms. Now, **quantum mechanics** is a framework, just like **classical mechanics** is. **Classical mechanics** doesn't say what the world's made of. It gives you the fundamental rules and you pick out, oh, the world is made of particles or fluids or whatever, and here are the forces acting on them. And you plug that into the framework of **classical mechanics**. **Quantum mechanics** is the same way. Most of what you talk about when you first encounter **quantum mechanics**, electrons and photons or whatever, you're applying the rules of **quantum mechanics** to particles. But we've known since the time of **Maxwell** at least that there are also fields, right? There's the electric field, the magnetic field, the gravitational field, maybe there are others. So we can also apply the rules of **quantum mechanics** to fields. And lo and behold, we get what is called **quantum field theory**. **Quantum field theory** then is not a replacement or an improvement on **quantum mechanics**. It's just the rules of **quantum mechanics** applied to fields rather than particles. And what happens is you take a field, so a field is the opposite of a particle. A particle has a location, a field exists everywhere, but it has a value at every point. So the electric field is a little arrow at every single point in space, has a direction and a length. And then you say, okay, that's a field. I'm gonna apply the rules of **quantum mechanics** to it. So I'm gonna invent a **wave function** for the field, and I'm gonna say, what is the probability the field looks a certain way doing certain things? And the math just goes through exactly like an electron sitting in an atom. There are certain discreet vibrational frequencies of the field, and that shows up in particle physics experiments as particles. The field vibrates a little bit, you think you're looking at one particle. If the field vibrates a little bit more, now you think you're looking at two particles, and you can match up exactly the mathematical descriptions on both sides. So the resolution to this early mystery of **quantum mechanics**, why do electrons or photons behave like particles sometimes, behave like waves other times? The answer is number one, they're waves. That's what they are. They're waves in a field. Not only is there an electric field, a magnetic field, there's an electron field for the electron particle. There's a neutrino field, there's a quark field, everything is made of fields. But number two, when you apply the rules of **quantum mechanics** to fields, they show up in our experiments like particles. So this is why it explains this distinction that things act like waves when we're not looking at them and appear to us as particles when we do.

### 费米子、玻色子与标准模型

**Sean Carroll**: 如果我们回想19世纪末那位认为物质由粒子组成、力来自场的物理学家，他现在身在何处？在一个一切实际上都是场，但当你将**量子力学**的规则应用于它们时，它们看起来像粒子的世界里，他会怎样？好吧，事实证明有两种不同类型的场：**费米子**和**玻色子**。区别在于，你是否允许将场的振动相互叠加，让它们振动得越来越多？这是你习惯的，对吧？如果我有一根小提琴弦，我可以轻轻拨动它，也可以用力拨动它。这就是我们所说的**玻色子场**。**玻色子场**可以相互叠加。但**费米子场**有一个稍微有趣的特性，即场中一次只能有一种振动。在粒子语言中，我们说在空间的任何一个区域或任何一个量子态中，我们可以拥有任意数量的**玻色子粒子**，但一个**费米子**会占据空间。**费米子**一次只能有一个。如果你再回到你的化学课，为什么你不能把所有电子都放在最低的轨道上？有一个规则叫做**泡利不相容原理**，它说对于原子轨道的任何一种形状，一次只能有一个电子在里面。严格来说是两个电子，因为它可以顺时针或逆时针旋转，但这是基本要点。**费米子**占据空间。所以，我们1898年的物理学家认为世界是由粒子和场组成的，原因是因为它实际上是由场组成的，但这些场可以是**玻色子**或**费米子**，而**费米子场**有点像粒子。它们不能相互叠加形成一个大的经典场，比如电、磁或引力。20世纪在物理学中，它仍将被认为是物理学史上一个极其重要的时期。即使1000年后我们仍在教授物理学，20世纪仍将被铭记。我们不仅发明了**相对论**和**量子力学**，而且弄清楚了存在哪些粒子和场，至少是构成你我的那些。你知道，我们大约在1900年开始。我们试图理解原子。我们意识到有一个原子核，原子核周围有电子。然后我们意识到原子核不是不可分的。它由质子和中子组成。快进到20世纪60年代和70年代，我们意识到质子和中子本身不是基本粒子。每个质子和每个中子都包含三个**夸克**。它的工作原理是，质子带正一电荷，中子带零电荷。有一种**夸克**叫做**上夸克**，带正三分之二电荷，另一种**夸克**叫做**下夸克**，带负三分之一电荷。所以如果你坐在家里，试着弄清楚如何制造一个质子？如何制造一个中子？你很快就会发现一个质子有两个**上夸克**和一个**下夸克**，一个中子有两个**下夸克**和一个**上夸克**。这是一个相当不错的图景，但由于粒子有时会改变身份而变得复杂。这在20世纪早期又是一个令人兴奋的事情。**放射性衰变**，对吧？如果我有一个单独的中子，它可以衰变为一个质子和一个电子。这不太行，因为能量等某些东西不守恒。我们最终发现还有另一种粒子叫做**中微子**，它是在中子衰变时产生的。实际上，一个中子衰变为质子、电子和**反中微子**。这怎么发生的呢？中子有两个**下夸克**和一个**上夸克**，质子有两个**上夸克**和一个**下夸克**。在中子内部，其中一个**下夸克**通过吐出一个电子和一个**反中微子**转化为一个**上夸克**。所以这是一个相当不错的图景。我们有四种不同类型的物质粒子，四种不同类型的**费米子**：**上夸克**和**下夸克**（它们都在质子和中子内部），然后我们有电子和**中微子**。好吧，你可能认为这就是你的完整图景。然后我们早在20世纪30年代就发现了电子的一个更重的“表亲”。这被称为**缪子**。**哥伦比亚大学**的物理学家**I.I. 拉比**曾有名地问道：“谁订购了这个？”我们不知道为什么电子需要一个更重的“表亲”参与，但现在我们知道，这是因为**上夸克**和**下夸克**这两种**夸克**以及电子和**中微子**这两种非**夸克**（我们现在称之为**轻子**）的模式重复了两次。所以有**三代粒子**。有**上夸克**和**下夸克**，但也有更重的“表亲”：**粲夸克**和**奇夸克**，以及更重的“表亲”：**顶夸克**和**底夸克**。而在**轻子**方面，我们有电子和与电子相关的**中微子**（我们巧妙地称之为**电子中微子**）。我们有**缪子**，它的更重“表亲”和**缪中微子**。然后我们有**陶子**，它比**缪子**更重，以及**陶中微子**。六种**夸克**，六种**轻子**，分为**三代**。所有这些粒子，它们都是通过**玻色子场**相互作用的**费米子**。我们当然有电磁场，我们有引力场，然后我们有核力。在质子和中子内部，有**胶子**，它们携带我们所说的**强核力**。**胶子**将粒子结合在一起，将**夸克**结合在质子和中子内部。而中子转化为质子、电子、**中微子**的过程，就是**弱核力**。它由被称为**W和Z玻色子**的粒子携带。所以这或多或少就是这个图景。这是我们直到几年前发现的所有粒子的图景。我们有六种**费米子**，我们有四种力。事实证明，要让整个事情契合，我们需要再多一个粒子，那就是**希格斯玻色子**。**希格斯玻色子**并不是真正的力载体粒子，但它也不是真正的**费米子**。它是遍布整个空间的场的一部分，其他粒子就像在其中“游泳”一样。其他粒子，比如**夸克**和电子等等，感受**希格斯场**的影响，它会影响它们的性质，比如它们的质量和电荷。所以**希格斯场**最终在2012年以**希格斯玻色子**的形式被发现，据我们所知，这是我们能在地球上产生的所有粒子。这构成了我们所说的**粒子物理学标准模型**。如果你在地球上做实验，到目前为止，它与**粒子物理学标准模型**100%兼容。我们向外看，我们看到我们需要**暗物质**之类的东西。**暗物质**似乎不符合**标准模型**。所以我们乐观地认为还有我们尚未发现的粒子，但目前我们正在很好地拟合我们拥有的数据。如果你考虑**标准模型**，它一方面令人惊叹。一切都像一个紧密构建的拼图一样契合。一切都很重要。一切都有其目的等等。但另一方面，它在某些方面又显得有些巴洛克式，甚至有些丑陋。如此多的粒子，看起来随机的质量和这些粒子的相互作用。我们希望有些东西更漂亮一点。事实上，**标准模型**中的大多数粒子在你的日常生活中并不扮演角色，这仅仅是因为有一个特性：如果你有一个更重的粒子，一个质量很大的粒子，它将能够并愿意衰变为更轻的粒子。唯一阻止它的是，有一些守恒量，比如电荷和自旋等等，你无法摆脱它们。例如，宇宙中**夸克**的总数是守恒的。所以电子是带电荷（负一电荷）的最轻粒子。质子是内部**夸克**总数非零的最轻稳定粒子。**中微子**是具有自旋（我们称之为半自旋单位）的最轻粒子，这使它成为**费米子**。事实证明，这些基本上就是构成我们的粒子。中子也被包括在内，因为当你将中子和质子结合时，你可以形成一个稳定的原子核。但如果你想想**粲夸克**、**缪子**、**陶子**，无论什么，**顶夸克**和**底夸克**，**希格斯玻色子**，所有这些粒子都会衰变。它们在大爆炸附近，在非常早期的宇宙中存在，但随后衰变为更轻的粒子。这些更轻的粒子组装成原子。原子在恒星内部转化并制造更重的元素，最终它们构成了我们。所以你不需要**标准模型**的很多成分来解释你。你是由**上夸克**、**下夸克**和电子组成的，它们通过**强核力**和电磁力结合在一起。这解释了99.99%的你。你需要了解一些关于质量和**希格斯玻色子**等的细节。引力很重要，但它不需要那么多。有趣的是，你当然可以想象，粒子物理学家喜欢想象，还有我们尚未发现的新场和粒子。宇宙中的**暗物质**是我们直接拥有的最好证据，必须存在一些我们尚未发现的粒子，才能解释我们在星系和宇宙中看到的引力。我们不知道**暗物质**粒子是什么。我们知道有多少**暗物质**以及它在哪里。我们不知道它是什么类型的粒子，但我们知道它不与你和你的身体相互作用。我们怎么知道的？因为粒子之间相互作用的规则是存在的。如果某个粒子能与你身体的组成部分——电子、质子和中子相互作用，那么我们就能在实验室中制造它。我们只需将其他粒子撞击在一起，观察会产生什么，然后**暗物质**就会出现。事实上，这是粒子物理学家最喜欢做的事情，通过撞击其他粒子来寻找新粒子。我们通过这样做没有发现任何不在**粒子物理学标准模型**中的东西。所以几乎肯定存在新的未知粒子和场，但它们要么能量太高，无法在我们最好的粒子加速器中制造出来；它们质量太大，需要太多的能量来创造它们；或者它们与普通物质的相互作用非常微弱，以至于可能有机会制造出来，但我们没有注意到。无论如何，你是由电子、质子和中子通过电磁力、引力以及核力相互作用而组成的。

### 涌现现象与核心理论

**Sean Carroll**: 物理世界组织方式的一个非常迷人的现象是我们称之为**涌现**的现象。这个房间里的空气，我可以通过说它有特定的密度、特定的温度、也许特定的速度来描述它。但我内心深处知道它是由原子和分子组成的。但我不需要告诉你空气中每个原子和分子的位置和速度，就能告诉你关于它的有用而有趣的事情。我们可以根据极其不完整的信息，对事物进行近似但非常非常好的描述。我可以在不知道地球上每个原子的确切位置和速度的情况下，预测地球绕太阳的运动。所以这对物理学来说是一个好消息和坏消息并存的情况。我们知道构成你我的粒子。我们知道所谓的**物理学核心理论**。**核心理论**基本上是**爱因斯坦**的**广义相对论**加上**粒子物理学标准模型**。这个**核心理论**足以支撑日常世界的所有物理学。这是好消息。有两个坏消息。一个坏消息是很难超越它。我们知道这个理论不是最终答案。我们并不是说**核心理论**是万有理论。它不能解释**大爆炸**、**黑洞**或**暗物质**等等。好吧？另一个坏消息是，原则上，它确实可以解释化学、生物学、心理学、政治学，谁知道呢？但在实践中，这些信息是完全无用的。如果你想成为一名生物学家，了解**顶夸克**对你的生活并不重要。即使了解**上夸克**和**下夸克**也不是那么重要，尽管原子核中有质子和中子，原子中有原子核，生物有机体中有原子。如果你想研究生物学，最好的办法是研究生物学，而不是研究粒子物理学。所以我认为现实的不同层次如何相互依赖是极其重要的。我们对一个层次了解得非常非常好，那就是**量子场论**、原子等层面的粒子和力。我们希望在这个层次上做得更好，但我们已经非常非常了解它了。它导致了化学和原子层次。我坐的椅子的稳定性最终归结为**量子场论**的规则。这些原子和分子通过电和磁结合在一起，构成了所有的化学，这是一个相当大的成就。化学结合在一起构成了生物学，依此类推。我们既可以认识到这些不同层次相互依赖，也可以认识到要研究和理解它们，我们需要认真对待每个层次本身。物理学不仅仅是一套真理、方程之类的东西。在很多方面，它是一种态度。它是一种思考不同事物的方式。所以它可以带你走得很远。你可以谈论各种事物的物理学，一直到社会物理学。你可以使用与**统计力学**和其他19世纪出现的思想非常相似的想法来模拟社会群体或投票之类的东西。所以不同学科之间应该而且确实存在密切的交叉授粉。我的大学**约翰·霍普金斯大学**有一个整个系叫做**生物物理学**，因为物理学家和生物学家一起工作是一项非常有用的事业。话虽如此，这并不意味着物理学中的所有思想都对生物学家有用，特别是**希格斯玻色子**或**顶夸克**的质量或强相互作用中的**自发对称破缺**等思想。这些对生物学家来说并不是那么有趣，而且它们也不需要有趣。它们是具体的思想，而不是通用的技术。我能说的最接近生物学家了解一点**物理学核心理论**的用处，是一种负面的意义。有些事情你可能会合理地想象对生物学很重要，但物理学家可以过来告诉你，不，那行不通。它违反了物理定律。我想到的是用我的意念弯曲勺子，对吧？你知道，我们可以想象我拥有**念力**。我可以用我脑子里发生的事情，毕竟大脑非常复杂。我们对它的运作方式了解不多。也许它有可能产生某种力，可以在我不接触的情况下推动物体。物理定律在这里告诉你，这不会发生，因为我们只有少数几个组成部分。我们有引力，有电磁力等等。我们知道什么是可能的某些限制。如果你是一名工程师，你可能是一个非常非常聪明的工程师。你不会设计一艘能以超光速飞行的火箭飞船。你不会制造一台无需燃料或能量输入就能永远运行的发动机。你不会制造**永动机**。你不会违反电荷守恒等规则。所以可悲的是，物理学对我们能做的事情施加了限制，这些限制比我们想象的要狭窄一些，但它也提出了可能的新想法，这些想法可能会带来一些巨大的惊喜。

**Sean Carroll**: One super fascinating thing about the way the physical world has arranged itself is this phenomenon we like to call **emergence**. The idea that the air in this room. I could describe by saying, well, it has a certain density, a certain temperature, you know, a certain velocity perhaps. But I know deep down that it's made of atoms and molecules. But I don't need to tell you the position and velocity of every atom and molecule in the air to tell you useful, interesting things about it. We can have approximate, but really, really good descriptions of things based on wildly incomplete information about them. I can predict the motion of the earth around the sun without knowing the exact position and velocity of every atom in the earth. So this is a good news, bad news situation for physics. We know the particles that you and I are made of. We know what is called the **core theory of physics**. The **core theory** is basically **Einstein's theory of general relativity** for gravity, plus the **standard model of particle physics**. And that **core theory** suffices to underlie all of the physics of the everyday world. That's the good news. There's two pieces of bad news. One piece of bad news is it's hard to go beyond that. We know that this theory is not the final answer. We're not saying that the **core theory** is the theory of everything. It doesn't explain the **big bang** or **black holes** or **dark matter**, et cetera. Okay? The other piece of bad news is in principle, it does account for chemistry, biology, psychology, politics, who knows? But in practice, that's completely useless information. If you want to be a biologist, knowing about the **top quark** is not important to your life. Even knowing about **up and down quarks** is not that important, despite the fact that there are protons and neutrons in nuclei and there are nuclei in atoms, and there are atoms in biological organisms. If you wanna study biology, your best bet is to study biology, not to study particle physics. So I think it's incredibly significant how the different layers of reality depend on each other. And we know one layer really, really well, the layers of particles and forces at the level of **quantum field theory** and atoms and things like that. We would like to do even better at that layer, but we understand it very, very well. It leads to the layer of chemistry and atoms. The stability of the chair that I'm sitting on ultimately comes down to the rules of **quantum field theory**. Those atoms and molecules come together with electricity and magnetism to make all of chemistry, which is a pretty big deal. Chemistry comes together to make biology and so up on the ladder. We can both appreciate that these different levels depend on each other while appreciating also that to study them and to understand them, we need to take each level seriously for its own sake. Physics is not just a set of true facts and equations and things like that. In many ways it's kind of an attitude. It's a way of thinking about different things. So it can take you very far. You can talk about the physics of different kinds of things all the way up to the physics of society. You can model social groups or voting or things like that using very similar ideas to **statistical mechanics** and other ideas that came about in the 1800s. So there should be and is a close cross-pollination between different disciplines. There's a whole department at my university, **Johns Hopkins**, called **Biophysics**, because physicists and biologists working together is an incredibly useful endeavor. Having said that, that doesn't mean that all ideas in physics are useful to biologists, and in particular, the ideas of the **Higgs boson** or the mass of the **top quark** or **spontaneous symmetry breaking** in the strong interactions. These are not that interesting to biologists and they don't need to be. They're specific ideas. They're not general techniques. The closest I could come to saying, how useful is it for a biologist to know a little bit about the **core theory** of physics is kind of in a negative sense. There are things you might plausibly imagine could be important to biology, but the physicist can come along and say, no, that can't work. It violates the laws of physics. I'm thinking of something like bending a spoon with my mind, right? You know, we could imagine that I have the powers of **telekinesis**. I can use what's going on in my mind, which after all, the brain is very complicated. We don't really understand a lot about how it works. Maybe it's possible that it could give rise to some force that could push things around without me touching it. The laws of physics are here to tell you that's not going to happen, because we only have a few ingredients. We have gravity, we have electromagnetism and so on. We know certain limits on what is possible. If you're an engineer, you might be a very, very clever engineer. You're not gonna design a rocket ship that can travel faster than the speed of light. You're not gonna build an engine that runs with no fuel input or energy input forever. You're not gonna build a **perpetual motion machine**. You're not gonna violate the rules of **conservation of electric charge** and things like that. So sadly, physics puts limits on what we can do that are a little bit more narrow than what we can imagine, but also it suggests new ideas for things that might be possible, and those can lead to some big surprises.

### 量子场论的挑战与自然界的“技巧”

**Sean Carroll**: 到了20世纪中叶，物理学处于一种奇怪的境地，因为我们已经有了**量子力学**的思想。我们甚至有了**量子场论**的思想。在20世纪40年代到50年代早期，像**理查德·费曼**、**朱利安·施温格**、**朝永振一郎**这样的人，弄清楚了如何驯服**量子场论**似乎存在的问题。当人们最初发明**量子场论**时，它对一些非常简单的问题给出了荒谬的答案，比如两个电子相互碰撞的概率是多少？所以**费曼**和他的朋友们想出了如何解决这个问题，但这实际上只适用于电磁学。那是我们真正在量子层面理解的一种自然力。我们知道还有其他力。我们不知道**夸克**，但我们知道质子和中子在原子核内部是结合在一起的。事实上，我们有迹象表明存在所谓的**强核力**和**弱核力**。那么它们是什么呢？一个显而易见的做法是，既然电和磁运作得如此之好，我们不妨推广电和磁背后的思想，即所谓的**规范对称性**，也就是在空间和时间的不同点上场相互旋转的对称性。这就是**杨振宁**和**米尔斯**所做的。他们说，我们可以从**麦克斯韦**的电磁学推广到一大堆其他不同但相似的理论。也许其中一个可以描述核力。问题在于，在电磁学中，这种对称性的存在预示着一些非常引人注目的东西，即光子没有质量。它是一个无质量粒子。作为一个无质量粒子意味着与该粒子相关的力在空间中延伸得很远。事实上，我们知道的两个无质量粒子是电磁学中的**光子**和引力中的**引力子**，两者都产生长程力。但核力不是长程力。它们被限制在原子核内部非常短的距离内。所以其他人说，嗯，它不可能像电磁学那样是类似的**规范原理**，必须是不同的东西。事实证明，**弱核力**和**强核力**都源于**规范对称性**，非常类似于电磁学，但大自然以非常巧妙的方式将它们隐藏起来。我喜欢说这是因为宇宙爱我们，宇宙爱我们的原因是因为它用尽了书中所有可能的技巧来构建**粒子物理学标准模型**，以便当物理学家们弄清楚它，当研究生们必须解决这些问题时，它能带来最大的回报。所以，基本上，如果你想让这些无质量粒子不产生长程力，有两种不同的方法。一种方法被**强相互作用**所利用，另一种方法被**弱相互作用**所利用。**强相互作用**是由携带**强核力**的**胶子**实现的。它们是无质量粒子，但它们不会延伸到无穷远，因为它们不断相互碰撞。**强核力**是一个强相互作用理论，所以**胶子**只是在质子和中子内部打转，相互碰撞，你无法将它们分开。这就是为什么这种力是短程的。对于**弱核力**，是**希格斯玻色子**在起作用。**希格斯玻色子**充满所有空间，并通过吸收**弱核力**来限制它。**W和Z玻色子**的力线本想延伸到无穷远，却被它们周围的**希格斯场**吞噬了。所以，基本上，大自然利用它能想到的一切技巧，以有趣的方式让物理学发挥作用，而最终，弄清楚这一切确实能给物理学家带来成就感。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sean Carroll**: By the middle of the 20th century, physics was in a funny kind of place because we had the idea of **quantum mechanics**. We even had the ideas of **quantum field theory**. It was in the 1940s, early '50s that people like **Richard Feynman**, **Julian Schwinger**, **Shin'ichirō Tomonaga**, figured out how to tame the problems that **quantum field theory** seemed to have. When people first invented **quantum field theory**, it gave nonsense answers for very simple questions like what is the probability the two electrons bump into each other? So **Feynman** and his friends figured out how to fix that, but it was really only for electromagnetism. That was the one force of nature that we really understood at the quantum level. We knew there were other forces. We didn't know about quarks, but we knew that protons and neutrons were kept together inside the nucleus of an atom. And in fact, we had hints that there was something called the **strong nuclear force** and the **weak nuclear force**. So what were they? Well, an obvious thing the do is to say if electricity and magnetism works so well, let's just generalize the idea underlying electricity and magnetism, which is something called **gauge symmetry**, symmetry of rotating fields into each other at different points in space and time. So this is what **Yang and Mills** did. They said, we can go from electromagnetism, a la **Maxwell**, to a whole bunch of other kinds of theories that are different, but similar. Maybe one of them describes the nuclear forces. The problem was in electromagnetism, the existence of that symmetry predicts something very noticeable, namely, the **photon** has zero mass. It's a massless particle. Being a massless particle means the force associated with that particle extends very far throughout space. And indeed the two massless particles we know about are the **photon** of electromagnetism and the **graviton** of gravity, both of which give rise to long range forces. But the nuclear forces are not long range. They're confined to very short distances inside the nucleus. So other people said, well, it can't be a similar **gauge principle** like electromagnetism, has to be something different. It turns out that indeed both the **weak nuclear force** and the **strong nuclear force** are due to **gauge symmetries** much like electromagnetism, but nature hides them from us in very clever ways. And I like to say this is because the universe loves us, and the reason why the universe loves us is because it uses every possible trick in its book to construct the **standard model of particle physics** to make it the most rewarding it can be when physicists figure it out and when graduate students have to solve those problems. So basically, if you want these massless particles to not give rise to long range forces, there's two different ways to do it. One way is made use of by the **strong interactions**, and the other way is made use of by the **weak interactions**. And the **strong interactions** is the **gluons** that are carrying the **strong nuclear force**. They are massless particles, but they don't stretch out to infinity because they keep bumping into each other. The **strong nuclear force** is a strongly interacting theory, so the **gluons** just zoom around in circles, bumping into each other inside the protons and neutrons, and you can't pull them apart. That is why that force is short range. For the **weak nuclear force**, it's the **Higgs boson** that is doing the work. The **Higgs boson** fills all of space and basically confines the **weak nuclear force** by absorbing it. The lines of force from the **W and Z bosons**, which would want to stretch out to infinity, get eaten up by the **Higgs field** that is all around them. So basically, nature uses every trick that it can think of to make physics work in interesting ways, and it really does give physicists a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day to figure it all out.

### 意识与量子力学基础

**Sean Carroll**: **量子力学**很奇怪，因为尽管我们现在正在庆祝它的百年诞辰，但我们仍然不理解它。我们使用它，并取得了惊人的成功，无论是建造**大型强子对撞机**还是制造消费电子产品中的半导体设备，**量子力学**都在那里，经过测试，非常可靠，但请记住，它有这样一个想法：当你测量某物时，它会改变你测量的量子系统的状态，而你还没有告诉我测量某物意味着什么，这就是**测量问题**。所以，当然，测量某物最明显的例子是当我作为一个有意识的人类实际进行测量时。因此，在20世纪中叶，公开思考意识是否在物理学的基本定律中扮演重要角色是完全合理且极具诱惑力的。现在，我只能告诉你，我不这么认为。我非常倾向于另一种观点。我认为意识是根据物理定律，由所有复杂事物的普通相互作用而产生的。但有一种学派认为，意识实际上是导致**量子力学**中**波函数**坍缩的原因，或者也许我甚至不应该将**波函数**视为真实存在。我应该将进行测量的“**代理**”视为真实存在，我使用**量子力学**作为工具来预测它们的测量结果。所以，一方面，我对这些问题的答案有自己的看法，但另一方面，更重要的是，我认为我们没有花足够的时间和精力来解决这些问题。我们有点把它们扫到地毯下面了。有一个完整的领域叫做**量子力学基础**。在我们这个最好、最重要的基础物理学框架中，到底发生了什么？我喜欢半开玩笑地说，如果你告诉一个对此一无所知的人，哦，是的，我们有一个美妙的世界理论，但其中一部分我们不理解，我们仍在为此挣扎。他们会认为，哦，那一定是试图理解这些东西是物理学中最重要的目标。那些专门研究它的人是那些被最好的大学以高薪挖走的魅力科学家等等，而现实恰恰相反。如果这是你在物理学中的专长，你会发现很难找到工作。大多数物理系都不想思考**量子力学基础**，因为他们找不到通过实验取得进展的方法。所以我很高兴人们对**量子力学基础**有疯狂的想法，即使这些疯狂的想法以某种方式将意识带入其中。我不认为那是最终的解决方案，但除非很多聪明人投入大量精力，否则我们是无法弄清楚的。

**Sean Carroll**: **Quantum mechanics** is weird because despite the fact that we're celebrating its 100th anniversary right now, we still don't understand it. We use it, we put it to work with amazing success, whether it's building **large Hadron Collider** or building like a semiconductor device in a consumer electronics thing, **quantum mechanics** is there, tested very, very reliable, but remember, it has this idea that when you measure something, it changes the state of the quantum system you measured, and you haven't told me what it means to measure something, the **measurement problem**. So of course the most obvious example of measuring something is when I as a conscious human being actually make a measurement of something. So it was perfectly legitimate and absolutely tempting, let's say, in the middle of the 20th century, to wonder out loud, does this mean that consciousness plays an important role in the fundamental laws of physics? Now, all I can tell you is I don't think so. I think very much the other way. I think the consciousness arises out of the ordinary interplay of all the complicated things going on according to the laws of physics. But there is a school of thought that says actually consciousness is responsible for the collapse of the **wave function** in **quantum mechanics**, or maybe I shouldn't even think about **wave functions** as real things. I should think about **agents** making measurements as the real things, and I use **quantum mechanics** as a tool to predict what their measurement outcomes will be. So on the one hand, I have my opinions about what the answer to these questions are, but on the other hand, even more importantly, I think we don't spend enough time and spend enough brain power addressing these questions. We've kind of swept them under the rug. There's this whole field called the **foundations of quantum mechanics**. What is really going on in this our best, most important framework for doing fundamental physics? And I like to sort of semi joke that if you were to tell somebody who didn't know anything about it, oh yeah, we have this wonderful theory of the world, but there's a part of it which we don't understand, we're still struggling with that. They would think, oh, it must be that trying to understand that stuff is the single most important goal in physics. That the people who are specializing it are the glamour scientists who are stolen away by the best universities with huge salaries and so forth, whereas the reality is the opposite. If this is your specialty in physics, you'll find it very, very difficult to get a job. Most physics departments don't want to think about the **foundations of quantum mechanics** because they can't figure out a way to make progress by doing experiments. So I'm glad that people have crazy ideas about the **foundations of quantum mechanics**, even if those crazy ideas somehow bring consciousness into the mix. I don't think that's ultimately the way to go, but we're not gonna figure it out unless a lot of smart people put a lot of effort into doing so.

### 物理学的未竟事业：暗物质、量子引力与弦理论

**Sean Carroll**: 我之前说过，19世纪末的物理学家如果认为他们几乎大功告成，那他们是可以被原谅的。他们几乎完全掌控了局面。顺便说一句，实际上很少有人真正做到了。你可能会找到那个时代一两个物理学家的引言，但大多数物理学家都比那更谨慎一些。事实上，有些人非常明确地说，不，不，不，我们还没有。我们还没有完成。坚持住。现在又发生了，对吧？一百多年后的今天，我们处于这样一种情况：我们有一个理论，**标准模型**加上**广义相对论**，它符合我们所有的数据，但我们知道它不是最终答案。你今天找不到任何一位物理学家会说我们拥有完整的理论。他们可能对我们离完整理论有多近有不同的看法。我们知道我们没有完整理论有几个明显的原因。宇宙中的**暗物质**是最明显的实验结果。尽管我们尚未在实验室中探测到**暗物质**，但我们已经在天空中看到了它的效应。我们无法将其纳入**标准模型**，所以这证明我们尚未完成粒子和场的研究。在理论方面，我说过我们有引力，我们有**粒子物理学标准模型**，但我们只在引力场相对较弱的有限范围内理解**量子引力**。我们基于**量子引力**理解了地球为何绕太阳转，或者苹果为何从树上掉下来，但我们不理解当引力变得强大时，比如在**黑洞**中或**大爆炸**附近会发生什么。这就是**量子引力**问题，目前实验上无法触及。我们知道在粒子加速器中需要多大的能量才能使**量子引力**效应变得明显，而这远远远远远远超出了我们目前在地球上用现有技术所能做到的。在20世纪80年代，曾有一段时间人们对所谓的**弦理论**或**超弦理论**非常兴奋，这种兴奋是完全有道理的，因为人们提出了一个相对大胆的猜想：与其将基本物质单位想象成粒子，不如想象它们是微小的弦环。然后顺着这个思路，将其代入**量子力学**的规则，看看会发生什么。结果绝对令人惊叹。第一，你不可避免地预测了引力，这很重要，因为引力确实存在。第二，你不可避免地为其他一切留下了空间，为我们在宇宙中看到的所有**费米子**和**玻色子**以及所有这些场留下了空间。所以，一个统一的**万有理论**似乎非常容易实现，他们在20世纪80年代到90年代一直非常兴奋。**弦理论**，正如它所称，仍然是统一我们所知物理学的一个非常有前途的方法，但我们完全未能将其与实验数据联系起来。我们在80年代曾抱有希望。人们说，好吧，让我们根据**弦理论**计算电子的质量。结果发现比我们预期的要困难得多。也许那是因为**弦理论**不正确。我们不知道。也许是因为大自然这次对我们不那么友善。所以我认为，今天，很少有物理学家会试图预测我们离**万有基本理论**有多近。我认为必须有一个**万有基本理论**，因为宇宙存在。真实世界存在。真实世界会做一些事情。**万有理论**只是宇宙所做的一切的列表。而这对于我们人类来说，可能容易也可能不容易弄清楚。

**Sean Carroll**: I've said before that the late 19th century physicist would be forgiven for thinking that they were almost done. They almost had it completely under control. By the way, very few people actually did. You can find one or two quotes from physicists of the era, but most physicists are a little bit more cautious than that. In fact, some were very explicitly saying, no, no, no, we're not. We're not done yet. Hang in there. It's happening again, right? Now, over 100 years later, we're in a situation where we have a theory, the **standard model** plus **general relativity** that fits all the data that we have, but we know it's not the final answer. You'll find zero physicists today saying that we have the complete theory. They might have different opinions about how close we are to having the complete theory. There's several obvious reasons why we know we don't have the complete theory. **Dark matter** in the universe is the most obvious experimental result. Even though we haven't detected **dark matter** in the laboratory, we've seen its effects in the sky. We can't fit it into the **standard model**, so that's evidence that we can't be finished with particles and fields yet. On the theoretical side, I said that we have gravity and we have the **standard model of particle physics**, but we only understand **quantum gravity** in a very limited regime where the gravitational field is relatively weak. We understand on the basis of **quantum gravity** why the earth moves around the sun or apples fall from trees, but we don't understand what happens when gravity becomes strong like in a **black hole** or near the **big bang**. This is the problem of **quantum gravity**, and it's experimentally inaccessible at the present moment. We know what energy you would need to have at a particle accelerator in order to make **quantum gravitational** effects become obvious, and it's way, way, way, way, way bigger than what we can possibly do here on earth with present day technology. There was this moment in the 1980s when there was a lot of excitement about what is called **string theory**, or **super string theory**, and the excitement was entirely warranted because people made the relatively bold conjecture that instead of particles, you should imagine that the fundamental units of matter are little loops of string. And just follow your nose, plug that into the rules of **quantum mechanics**, see what happens. And what happens is absolutely amazing. Number one, you inevitably predict gravity, which is important 'cause gravity exists. Number two, you inevitably have the room for everything else, for all of the **fermions** and **bosons** and all these fields that we see in the universe. So the idea of a single unified theory of everything seemed very attainable, and they were very excited in the 1980s continuing on in the 1990s. **String theory**, as it is called, is still a very, very promising approach to unifying everything we know about physics, but we have completely failed in connecting it with experimental data. We were hopeful back there in the '80s. People said, okay, let's calculate the mass of the electron according to **string theory**. Turns out to be much, much harder than we ever anticipated it would be. And maybe that's because **strength theory** is not right. We don't know. Maybe it's because nature is just not being kind to us this time. So I think that today, far fewer physicists would try to predict how close we are to the fundamental theory of everything. I think there needs to be a fundamental theory of everything 'cause there is the universe. There is the real world. The real world does something. The theory of everything is just the list of everything the universe does. And that may or may not be easy for us human beings to figure out.

### 科学探索与《三体》的启示

**Sean Carroll**: **《三体》**是一部有趣的电视剧，改编自**刘慈欣**的精彩小说，其中涉及许多与物理学和宇宙学相关的有趣思想。我不会给你任何剧透之类的，但我曾为各种电视剧和好莱坞电影提供咨询，人们总是想知道物理学有多真实。我说，你知道，最常见的不真实物理学是，明星睡醒后，他们的睡衣没有褶皱。这与我所理解的物理定律完全不符。但在很多节目中，真正不真实的是科学研究的过程，**《三体》**也不例外。剧中一个重要的情节是，科学家们发现有数据与他们的理论不符，他们因此感到恐慌，不喜欢这样，然后自杀或退出物理学等等。这与现实世界中会发生的情况恰恰相反。在物理学中，没有什么比你的理论与新的数据不符更好的事情了，尤其是当一个理论已经运行得非常好很长时间之后。现在，如果你个人是提出这个理论的人，你可能会感到悲伤。但作为一个社区，这就是你取得进步的方式。如果你想赢得**诺贝尔物理学奖**，你不是要证明**爱因斯坦**是对的。你要证明**爱因斯坦**是错的。那才是让人们兴奋的方式。由于某种原因，现在，在基础物理学、宇宙学、引力、粒子物理学领域，我们的理论几乎太好了。我们的理论与数据非常非常吻合。这与100年前我们追逐所有这些新的、令人惊讶的实验结果的情况非常不同。那才是你能提出更好想法的时候。可能的物理理论空间太大了，无法仅仅猜测出正确答案。我们需要实验的指导，而我们需要的指导是意想不到的结果。所以唯一能做到这一点的方法就是建造更大更好的实验，而这正是我们现在正在努力做的事情。

**Sean Carroll**: The "**3 Body Problem**" is this fun TV show based on these wonderful novels by **Cixin Liu**, and there's a lot of interesting ideas that are related to physics and cosmology that come up. I'm not gonna give you any spoilers or anything like that, but I've consulted on various TV shows and Hollywood films and things like that, and people always want to know how realistic the physics is. And I say, you know, most often, like the unrealistic physics is that the star wakes up after sleeping in their bed and their pajamas are not wrinkled. Like that is completely incompatible with laws of physics as I understand them. But it's this process of doing science that is really unrealistic in a lot of shows, and the "**3 Body Problem**" is no different. A big plot point in the show is that scientists have discovered that there are data coming in that are incompatible with their theories and they sort of panic and they don't like it and you know, they commit suicide or they quit physics or whatever. This is exactly the opposite of what would happen in the real world. There's nothing better in physics than when your theory is incompatible with a new piece of data, especially a theory that has been working very, very well for a long time. Now, if you are individually the person who came up with the theory, you might be sad. But as a community, that's how you make progress. If you want to win the **Nobel Prize in physics**, you don't show that **Einstein** was right. You show that **Einstein** was wrong. That's the way to get people excited. And for whatever reason, right now, we're in a situation where in fundamental physics, in cosmology, gravity, particle physics, our theories are almost too good. Our theories are fitting the data really, really well. It's very different than the situation 100 years ago when we were chasing all of these new, surprising experimental results. That's when you can come up with better ideas. The space of possible theories of physics is way too big to just guess the right answer. We need guidance from experiments, and the kind of guidance we need is unexpected results. So the only way to do that is to build bigger and better experiments, and that's what we're trying very hard to do right now.

### AI与物理学：工具而非概念突破

**Sean Carroll**: 认为当我们建造更好的计算机，无论是真正的**量子计算机**还是更有效的人工智能算法，那会帮助我们做物理学，那会给我们带来新的想法，也许是来自某个地方的新输入，这几乎是一种不可避免的诱惑。我一方面对**量子计算机**和**AI**作为物理学工具的有用性超级乐观，同时又对它们会带来新的概念突破持相当怀疑的态度。计算机真正擅长的是解决定义明确的问题。所以在数学中，例如，如果你有一个定理，你想证明这个定理，这是很多数学家所做的事情，证明定理，我毫不怀疑计算机将开始比人类更擅长证明定理。计算机在下棋和围棋方面比人类更强。证明定理也大致是同一个方向。但做数学远不止这些，因为做数学首先涉及提出问题。比如，如果我把这个东西和那个东西放在一起会怎样？物理学也非常相似。如果我以一种全新的方式思考这个特定的系统会怎样？它们不是定义明确的问题，而这些是计算机不那么擅长的领域。也许它们会达到那个水平。我毫不怀疑，原则上，计算机可以和人类一样好。但由于我们人类甚至不理解我们在进行这些创造性飞跃时发生了什么，所以我们很难训练计算机去做。所以至少在我有生之年，我不认为我的工作会因为计算机革命而失业。有太多问题容易提出却难以回答。你知道，人们在我的播客上问我，如果你只能知道未来一个物理结果，那会是什么？嗯，我想知道**万有理论**，对吧？这算作弊吗？这算不算不公平的答案？我想知道一切。但如果你想把它缩小到我们最好理解的某个方面，我想理解如何调和**量子力学**与引力，对吧？我想理解**量子力学**本身到底说了什么，以及引力是如何从中涌现出来的。我对此有一些想法。我们正在努力，你知道，在我们的日常工作中，但我怀疑有一些我们尚未猜到的深层东西，那将与一系列其他问题相关，比如**大爆炸**时发生了什么？**黑洞**内部发生了什么？你还可以问很多其他问题，但这是一组每个人都认识到非常重要的问题。我们都在非常努力地思考它，但我们还没有最终答案。

**Sean Carroll**: It's an almost inevitable temptation to think that when we build better computers, whether it's literally **quantum computers** or just much more effective **artificial intelligence algorithms**, that that will help us doing physics, that that will give us new ideas, maybe new input from somewhere. I'm on the one hand super optimistic about the usefulness of **quantum computers** and **AI** as tools in physics, and at the same time, pretty darn skeptical that it will lead to new conceptual breakthroughs. What computers are really good at doing is solving well-posed problems. So in mathematics, for example, if you have a theorem and you want to prove the theorem, this is a lot of what mathematicians do, prove theorems, I have no trouble imagining that computers are gonna start becoming better at proving theorems than human beings are. Computers are better at playing chess and go than human beings are. Proving theorems is kind of in the same direction. But doing math is so much more than that because doing math involves asking the questions in the first place. Like, what if I put this thing together with that thing? And physics is very similar. What if I think about this particular system in a completely new way? They're not well-defined problems, and those are the areas where computers are not as good. Maybe they will get there. I have no doubt that in principle, a computer can be just as good as a human being. But because we human beings don't even understand what's going on when we make these creative leaps it's hard for us to train the computers to do it. So in my lifetime anyway, I don't think that my job is in danger of being put out of work by the computer revolution. There's so many questions that are easy to ask and hard to answer. You know, people ask me on my podcast, you know, if you just be having one physics result from the future told you, what would it be? Well, I wanna know the **theory of everything**, right? Like, is that cheating? Is that not giving an unfair answer? I wanna know everything. But if you wanna narrow it down to like one aspect of everything that we better to understand, I wanna understand how to reconcile **quantum mechanics** with gravity, right? I wanna understand what **quantum mechanics** itself actually says and how gravity emerges from that. I have some ideas about it. We're working on it, you know, in our day jobs, but I suspect that there's something deep that we haven't yet guessed at yet, and that's gonna be related to a bunch of other questions like, what happened at the **Big Bang**? What happens inside **Black Holes**? There's many other questions you could ask, but that's one group of questions that everyone recognizes is really important. We're all thinking about it very hard, but we don't know the final answers yet.
