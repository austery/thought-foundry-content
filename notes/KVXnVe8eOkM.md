title: 胰岛素专家警告：这是痴呆症的第一个迹象！生酮饮食与大脑健康的惊人联系
---

### 导言：沙丁鱼挑战与生酮的力量

欢迎来到沙丁鱼挑战。在接下来的三天里，菜单上唯一的东西就是沙丁鱼。我挑战你每天尝试吃掉三罐，因为这是一个帮助你进入生酮状态的绝佳工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome to the sardine challenge. So, the only thing on the menu for the next 3 days is sardines. I challenge you to try and eat three of those cans in a day because that's a hell of a tool to help you get into a ketogenic state.</p>
</details>

当你处于**生酮状态**（Ketogenic State: 指身体主要使用脂肪而非碳水化合物作为能量来源的代谢状态）时，它有助于燃烧脂肪，肌肉量会增加并得以保持。我见过有患者的白发逆转了，他们的大脑性能、注意力和精力都得到了改善。所有这些事情都得到了提升。因此，我将教你如何进行高级的生酮饮食。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you're in a ketogenic state, it helps burn fat, muscle mass gets higher, preserved. I've seen patients that have reversed their gray hair and that brain performance, concentration, and energy. All of those things improve. And so, I'm going to teach you how to do an advanced ketogenic diet.</p>
</details>

安妮特·博斯沃思博士是胰岛素抵抗专家。凭借二十多年的经验，她发现你健康的关键不在于更多的治疗，而在于进入生酮状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Annette Bosworth is the insulin resistance specialist. With over two decades of experience, she's discovered that the key to your health isn't more treatments. It's to get into a ketogenic state.</p>
</details>

大多数人在不知不觉中分泌了大量的胰岛素。但当你胰岛素过量时，它就成了慢性病的制造者。它会导致高血压，它会导致癌症，它还会在大脑中产生碎片，这与抑郁、脑雾、阿尔茨海默症和帕金森症有关。为了逆转高胰岛素状态，我极力推动我的病人进行生酮饮食。一年之内，你将迎来你最好的生活。我真的把我妈妈从死亡边缘救了回来。

<p class="english-text">Most people have been making buckets of insulin without knowing it. But when you have excess insulin, it's a chronic disease maker. It is what makes high blood pressure. It is what makes cancer. It is what makes debris in the brain, which is linked to depression, brain fog, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. And so to reverse the high insulin state, I really push my patients to do the ketogenic diet. And what unfolds is your best life ahead within a year. Like I really rescued my mom from the edge of death.</p>

### 万病之源：被忽视的高胰岛素问题

**主持人：** 安妮特·博斯沃思博士，或者我应该叫你博斯医生。你所知道、相信和理解的，而你认为普通大众所不知道、不相信和不理解的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Annette Bosworth or should I call you Dr. Bos. What is it that you know and believe and understand that you think the general public doesn't know believe and understand?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 大多数人来找我的原因，如果他们知道如何定期制造**酮体**（Ketones: 当身体缺乏葡萄糖时，肝脏分解脂肪产生的一种替代能量分子），其实是可以逆转的。我是一名内科医生。这意味着，如果你去看内科医生而我们不知道出了什么问题，你可能就会有生命危险。我们处理棘手的难题，并且我们通过长期的慢性病管理来做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that most of the reasons people come to see me could be reversed if they knew how to make ketones on a regular basis. So, I'm an internist. Uh that means uh if you go to an internal medicine doctor and we don't know what's wrong, you're going to die. We take care of tough puzzles and we do this over long management, chronic disease management.</p>
</details>

所以，我有 25 年研究那些会降低生活质量的慢性问题的经验。当你长期看我时，你的寿命和健康寿命都会一落千丈。但如果你能常规地制造酮体，你就可以避免所有这些命运。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I've got 25 years of studying chronic problems that deteriorate the quality of life. Lifespan, health span, both go in the toilet when you're chronically seeing me. And you could abort all of that destiny if routinely you were making ketones.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 基本上你是一位慢性病医生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So So you're basically a chronic illness doctor.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 慢性病管理绝对是我的专长。我喜欢彼得·阿蒂亚（Peter Attia）使用的“医学 2.0”这个说法，我们是管理这些疾病的大师，确保处方到位，确保你正在治疗所有这些问题。内科医生是你最好的伙伴之一，因为你必须定期看他们，需要续药，需要检查副作用。这是一个循环往复的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chronic disease management is absolutely it. You know, I love the way uh Peter Aia uses medicine 2.0, which is what we are the masters of managing it, making sure the prescriptions are there, making sure you are treating all these problems. The internist being one of your best buddies cuz you're having to see them routinely. You got to get the meds refilled. You got to check for the side effects. It's a mill.</p>
</details>

### “医学2.0”的局限性：治标不治本

**主持人：** 在你的定义中，什么是“医学 2.0”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is medicine 2.0 in your definition?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 我可以让你免于死于分娩和感染。对于你的每一种症状，我都有解药。我们生活在一个医学已经解决了很多问题的世界里。像高血压这样的小事，腰间多了几磅赘肉的小事，脑雾这样的小事，哦，我的眼睛在老化。所有这些都是信号，表明你的身体制造的垃圾比清理掉的要多。你错过了一些人类应该遵守的规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, I can keep you from dying from childbirth and infections. And I have an antidote for every one of your symptoms. We are in a world where medicine has answered a lot of problems. Little things like high blood pressure. Little things like it's a few extra pounds around the middle. Little things like brain fog. Oh, my eyes are aging. All of these are signals that your body has made more trash than it cleaned up. And there were some rules to humans that you missed.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 对于点击收听这次对话的听众来说，他们花时间留下来听，最终能从中得到什么呢？对他们的生活来说，最终目标是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for for my listeners that have clicked on this conversation, what are they going to get out of giving us their time and staying with us and listening to this? What is the end goal going to be for them in their lives?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 聆听我与病人交谈的方式，并教他们如何逆转你已经有的医疗问题的步骤。通过这样做，你将获得自由，成为你梦寐以求的那种祖父母，而不是你已经放弃、认为自己再也无法成为的那种。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Listening to the way I talk to my patients and teach them the steps how to reverse the medical problems that you've already got on the roster. And by doing that, the freedom is to be the kind of grandparent that you dreamt of, but you've surrendered can't be there anymore.</p>
</details>

### 大脑清扫：逆转衰老与慢性病的关键

**主持人：** 这里涉及的困境或疾病清单是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is the list of predicaments or illnesses that are relevant here?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 最常见的是超重和大脑功能不佳。在我 25 年来见过的所有病人背后，我们真正致力于的是达到大脑性能的巅峰。即使你不考虑这一点，这也是我所考虑的。所以当你 55 岁走进来，我能看到帕金森症的忧虑正向你袭来，55 岁得帕金森症是非常年轻的。那是一个大脑里有太多垃圾而你还不知道的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most common one is being overweight and a brain that's not working right. What really is behind all of the patients I've seen for 25 years is we're working on peak brain performance. Even if you don't think about that, that's what I think about. So when you come in and you're 55 years old and I can see the worry of Parkinson's headed your way, super young is 55 years old with Parkinson's. That is a brain that's got too much trash and you don't know it yet.</p>
</details>

在博斯医生对抗帕金森症的历史上，帕金森症大概有 3500 名患者，而我一个都没有。帕金森症每次都赢。患有潜在慢性病的人最大的问题是，他们完全不知道它正在到来。一旦它降临，逆转就困难得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean in the history of Dr. Bos versus Parkinson's, Parkinson's has like 3,500 patients. I have zero. Parkinson's wins every time. And the the biggest moment of people who have chronic problems under the hood is they have no idea that it's coming. And once that lands, the reversal is much worse.</p>
</details>

提前 10 年看到它的到来，这是一份礼物，让我可以说：“让我告诉你如何撤销它，从悬崖边退回来。” 当大脑功能失常时，你会最怀念它。它与所有这些问题都有关，比如关节炎、腰腹赘肉、高血压，以及与心理状态的严重联系。你可以说这是抑郁症，但人们会说：“哦，我没有那个诊断。” 我说的是一个不想参与、在生活中再也找不到乐趣的大脑，因为它已经太多年没有清理垃圾了。让我教你如何清理垃圾。你将需要做几次，但一年之内，你最好的生活将在前方展开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">seeing it 10 years before it's supposed to be there. This is a gift of saying, "Let me show you how to undo that. Back away from the edge." It's that brain function that you're going to miss the most when it doesn't work. And it's linked to all of these things like the arthritis, the, you know, weight around the middle, the high blood pressure, the severe uh connection to mental uh approach, meaning you can say depression, but people say, "Oh, I don't have that diagnosis." I'm talking about a brain that doesn't want to engage, that doesn't find joy in their life anymore because it's been too many years since they took out the trash. Let me show you how to take out the trash. And you're going to have to do it a few times, but what unfolds is your best life ahead within a year.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 所以，你要教我如何清理垃圾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're going to teach me how to take out the trash.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我自己大脑里的垃圾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The trash in my own brain.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 如果我清理了自己大脑里的垃圾，我的生活会怎样变得更好？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if I take out the trash in my own brain, how is my life going to be better?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 你生活在 21 世纪，这里有大量的加工食品和许多你的身体在不告诉你情况下做事的方式。比如你受过的任何关节损伤，每次受伤它都会复发，下一次受伤会更容易一些。你的腰腹部是否有一圈赘肉，不止一英寸厚？你的专注时间是否变短了，你会说：“我能专注这么多个小时，但现在不行了。” 这些都是迹象。如果你能做到这一点，如果你能说：“不要停止清理垃圾。” 一年几次，甚至一个月几次，那么你就永远不必进入我所见的那个世界，人们像陷在流沙里，深陷到腰部，需要真正的生命线才能把他们拉出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You live in the 21st century where there's lots of processed foods and lots of ways that your body did things without telling you. So any injury that you've had, like a joint injury that keeps coming back every time you injure it, it it is a little easier to injure the next time. Is there a ring around the middle that's more more than pinch an inch? Is there a uh distance in time where you say, "I can focus for this many hours, but I can't do it for this many hours anymore." Those are all places where if you did this, if you were able to say, "Don't stop taking out the trash." Several times a year, several times a month, if you ask me, then you never have to come into this world that I just see people, they're they're in quicksand. They're up to their waist and getting them out. They need a real lifeline.</p>

### 胰岛素：沉默的慢性病制造者

**主持人：** 你能像对一个 12 岁的孩子一样给我解释一下什么是胰岛素以及它扮演的角色吗？因为我想我们这里关注的是长寿和衰老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, can you explain to me like I'm a 12-year-old what insulin is and the role it's playing because you know I guess we're focused here on how to I guess longevity aging.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 胰岛素（Insulin）有“隔绝”或“包裹”的作用。你可以把它想象成让你变得“蓬松”，让你长脂肪。它还有其他一些作用，但我们这里要谈论的是慢性病，在这种情况下，你并不缺乏胰岛素，而是分泌了过多的胰岛素。当胰岛素过量时，它会储存能量以备饥荒之需。它还会导致你生长。这里的“生长”意味着长胖一点，但也意味着像皮肤变厚、长出皮赘等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, insulin insulates. Okay. So, think of it as it makes you fluffy. It makes you it puts the fat on. Uh it's got some other roles too, but we're going to talk about chronic diseases here where it's not a scarcity problem. You you make plenty of it. And when it's in excess, it will store energy for when you go through a famine. It will also cause you to grow. Now, grow means get a little fatter, but it also means things like their skin gets a little thicker. They have skin tags.</p>
</details>

我总是思考的是他们大脑里发生了什么。当胰岛素水平年复一年地持续偏高时，就像你的情况一样，如果你今天剩下的时间都不吃东西，然后明天早上起来，大概需要这么长的时间，你的身体才能恢复到早上应有的基线水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I always think about is what's going on in their brain. And when that insulin is high for years and years and years, uh, just like yours, because if if you didn't eat the rest of today and then you got up tomorrow morning, it would be about that long after a late meal last night, that's how long it would take you to say, "Okay, we're back down to where we started from or where we should be in the morning."</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 对于一个从未听说过“胰岛素”这个词的人来说，需要一些背景知识来解释它的作用。所以它就像一个运输工具，帮助储存糖分或处理多余的糖分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For someone that's never heard the word insulin before, there's some context to give on in terms of what it's doing. So it's coming out like a transporter in helping put away the sugar or deal with the excess sugar.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的，它将葡萄糖或糖从血液循环中运送到细胞里。这是它的首要工作。但如果所有的细胞都满了，它们的储存空间都满了，它就会开始把糖分打包到肝脏里。假设肝脏的储存也满了，这种叫做胰岛素的激素会渗透到你身体的每个部分，以确保有燃料，确保有糖分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So it is what lifts Yeah. It lifts glucose or sugar from the circulation into a cell. That's its first primary job. But if all the cells are full, their storage is full, it's going to start to pack it into the liver. I mean, let's say all those stores are full too. This job uh of the of insulin, this hormone oozes into every part of your body to say make sure it's got f fuel. Make sure it's got that sugar.</p>
</details>

但大多数人都像我猜的你一样，大部分时间里你并不缺糖。所以它会把东西装满，然后把多余的糖转化成脂肪。糖太多了，储存不了，所有的储存空间都满了。于是身体发出信号：给我制造更多的细胞，我需要更多的储存单元。这家伙吃的比他想象的要多。我们要为度过饥荒做好准备。但在此期间，先把多余的能量转化成脂肪，让他变得更“蓬松”一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But most people are like what I would guess you are. Most of the time you don't you aren't a shortage of sugar. And so it feel it tops things off and then it will turn things into fat. It's too much sugar. They can't store it. All the storage is full. So you can send the signal out. Make me some more cells. I need some more storage units. This guy's eating more than he thinks he is. And we're going to be prepared to live through the famine. But in the meantime, turn it into fat. make him a little fluffier.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 高胰岛素的唯一后果就是我会变胖一点吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that the only consequence of high insulin is that I'm gonna I might be a bit more fat.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 不，那只是人们听得最多的一个。当你研究慢性病管理时，你会发现它促进了疾病和炎症的生长。它就是垃圾的制造者。所以我一直说，你需要定期清理垃圾，这意味着你的胰岛素水平一直比你想象的要高，因为它在持续“闷烧”。这是因为你生活在当今世界，吃加工食品，吃得太晚，而且你不会连续两三天不吃东西。你的身体储存已经满了。高胰岛素水平在一个健康人体内会掩盖垃圾正在被制造的事实，而你却不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that's just the one people hear about the most. When you look at chronic disease management, it is the growth of of the diseases of the inflammation. It's the making of the trash. So, I keep saying, you know, you you need to take the trash out routinely, which means that insulin, which has been smoldering higher than you think it is because you live in today's world, because you eat processed food, because you eat super late at night, uh you don't go two to three days without eating. You've you've got storage filled in your body. The high insulin levels in a healthy person hides that the debris is being made and you don't know it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 它会掩盖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It hides it.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。它会把垃圾塞在你大脑两个细胞之间，塞在皮肤细胞之间。直到胰岛素水平降低，垃圾才会被清理出去。不幸的是，大多数人一直在大量分泌胰岛素而自己却毫不知情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's going to put it in between two cells in your brain. It's going to go in between the skin cells. The trash doesn't get taken out until the insulin gets lower. And unfortunately, most people have been making buckets of insulin without knowing it.</p>
</details>

### 如何识别胰岛素抵抗的迹象

**主持人：** 有没有什么迹象表明我可能有高胰岛素水平或**胰岛素抵抗**（Insulin Resistance: 指身体细胞对胰岛素的反应能力下降，导致血糖难以被有效利用的病理状态）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are there any signs that I might have high levels of insulin or insulin resistance?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 腹围是第一个迹象，脂肪最先堆积在那里。当你胰岛素过量时，它就是慢性病的制造者。它导致癌症，导致高血压，导致大脑中产生碎片，你可以称之为抑郁、脑雾或帕金森症。这是大脑的衰老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdominal girth is the first thing that is the first place that the fat goes. when you have excess insulin which is this chronic disease maker. Uh it is what makes cancer. It is what makes high blood pressure. It is what makes debris in the brain where call it depression or brain fog or Parkinson's. It's the aging of the brain.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 它与所有这些事情都有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's linked to all of those things.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 所有这些事情。而没有人告诉你关于过量胰岛素的事。但症状是，天哪，我感觉每两到三个小时就得吃点东西。他们的燃料不断耗尽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of those things. And that excess insulin nobody tells you about. But the symptoms are, dang, I feel like I got to eat every two to three hours. Uh their debris uh or their fuel keeps running out.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我如何知道自己是否有胰岛素抵抗？有哪些关键迹象？你提到了皮赘，我以前从未听说过这个词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how do I know if I have insulin resistance? What what are the key signs? You mentioned skin tags. I've never heard that term before.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的，皮赘不是痣。痣是你能感觉到的皮肤上的一个肿块。但皮赘有一个颈部，像一个小蘑菇。最烦人的是，当病人来说：“我试着把它们都剪掉，但它们一直流血。” 我会说：“不要剪掉它们。” 当你的胰岛素水平降低时，它们会自己脱落。所以这是第一个迹象。它们通常出现在腋窝或皮肤摩擦的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, skin tags are not moles. So moles, you can feel this bump on your on your skin, right? But a skin tag has a neck and like a little mushroom. And it's the most annoying thing when patients come and say, "Well, I just tried to cut them all off, but they kept bleeding." I'm like, "Do not cut them off." They'll fall off when your insulin's lower. So that's the first place. It'll be found in their armpits or places where their skin rubs.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你还谈到天鹅绒般的皮肤也是一个指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talked about velvety skin. As well being an indicator.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 天鹅绒般的皮肤是一个拉丁词，叫“黑棘皮症”，这个花哨的词意味着皮肤更黑、更厚。通常发生的地方是脖子后面。你会听到一些故事，说“我试着洗我的脖子，它总是脏的。” 那不是污垢。那是皮肤在高胰岛素诅咒下的样子。现在在青少年中很常见。他们体重增加，生长激素已经在经历青春期的变化。现在再加上高胰岛素，他们就会出现这种“脏脖子综合征”，或者在肘部褶皱处，皮肤颜色更深。这是高胰岛素引起的病理现象，不正常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Velvety skin is this Latin word acanthosis nigricans which is fancy word that means the skin is darker and thicker. So the the places that usually happens is the back of the neck. And you'll hear you know stories of I tried to wash my neck. It's it's dirty all the time. It's not dirt. It is the way the skin is under the the curse of high insulin. And you see it in teenagers all the time now. They put on weight and their growth hormones are already doing that teenage thing. Now you put high insulin in there and they have this dirty neck syndrome or on the creases of their elbow. It's just darker here. Uh that is pathology that's not normal from high insulin.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你还提到了脚趾毛发的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's this thing about hairy toes that I was reading about?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。随着我的病人年龄增长，大多数 55 岁且有高胰岛素病史的人，我会告诉他们：“看看你的脚趾。它们上面应该有毛发。” 当你的身体处于高胰岛素状态几十年后，它会开始说：“我们不再向身体的某些部位输送资源了。” 他们脚趾上的毛囊就是其中之一。就像，别在脚趾上长毛了。这个问题会逐渐向上蔓延，从脚趾开始，然后是脚踝，再到膝盖，他们的下肢没有任何毛发。这是一个由高胰岛素引发的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So, as my patients age, so most my 55year-olds that have had high insulin, I will tell them, "Look at your toes. They're supposed to have hair on them." And when your body has had that high insulin state for a couple of decades now, it will start to say, "We don't send resources to a couple parts of the body anymore." And the follicles in their toe are one of them. Like, just stop growing hair on your toes. And there's an ascending problem with this where the toe starts, then it's the ankles, then it's up to the knees. and they don't have hair anywhere on their lower extremities. It is a process that started from high insulin.</p>
</details>

### 葡萄糖 vs. 酮体：大脑的两种燃料

**主持人：** 能量来源有两种。一种是葡萄糖，比如我昨晚吃的意面，那可能会让我的血液里产生很多葡萄糖，然后胰岛素出来处理。另一种是酮体，当我禁食或一段时间没吃碳水化合物，身体在寻找能量来源时就会出现。为什么我们的身体不直接靠酮体运行呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's these two energy sources. One of them is the the glucose. One of them's which is from like you know eating pasta which I ate last night. Um so that probably put a lot of glucose in my my blood. I probably had a high glucose spike and then insulin came out to deal with that. And then there's ketones, which start to appear when I'm fasting or when I haven't been eating carbs for a while and my body's looking for an energy source. So, why doesn't our body just run off ketones?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 一旦你降低了胰岛素，它就会。我的意思是，这些病人的胰岛素水平是逐渐升高的。他们不知道它在升高。他们去做血检，葡萄糖看起来正常。但多年来没人检查的是，需要多少那种“隔绝”激素（胰岛素）才能控制住葡萄糖。而这正是慢性病大量滋生的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It will as soon as you're done lowering your insulin. And I mean, insulin grew in these patients. They didn't know that it was growing high. They went to their blood test and their glucose looked normal. What nobody checked for years is how much of that insulating hormone did it take to keep the glucose controlled. And that's where chronic diseases are are grown in spades.</p>

当你想要储存葡萄糖时，我们会把它串成一种叫做**糖原**（Glycogen: 葡萄糖在体内的储存形式，主要存在于肝脏和肌肉中）的华丽链条。这是一种高效储存葡萄糖的方式，但一旦你的身体需要它，它就会把所有的糖解锁，重新供你使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Glucose, when you want to store it, we put it in a fancy string called glycogen. And it's just an efficient way to store glucose, but as soon as your body needs it, it will unlock all that sugar back into your access back for you.</p>
</details>

你没有意识到的是，你那边储存了多少糖原？储存了多少？这就是高胰岛素一直在做的事情。只是把它存起来，存起来。然后当你停止进食时，你就会知道你是否清空了所有储存的糖。你是否清空了？我不知道。你产生酮体了吗？你无法产生酮体，无法燃烧脂肪，直到那个“油箱”空了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What you don't realize is, well, how much glycogen you got stored over there? How much is there in storage? And that is what high insulin has been doing. Just put it in storage. Put it in storage. And then when you stop eating, you'll know if you emptied out all your stored sugar, which is some of the regular sugar you just ate, but then all this glycogen, this packaged sugar. How empty are you? I don't know. Have you made a ketone yet? You cannot make a ketone. You cannot burn fat until that that tank is empty.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 所以我的糖原储备可能持续一两天？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, I have these glycogen stores which last for what, a day or two?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 哦不。把它想象成红糖。你把糖打包得很紧，然后把它放在抽屉后面，它变得硬邦邦的，因为你从来没有降低过你的胰岛素。我有些超重的病人，我们让他们每天只摄入 20 克总碳水化合物。非常低的碳水化合物。他们需要 15 天才能产生一个酮体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, no. Think of it as brown sugar. So you package the sugar really tight and then you put it in the back of the drawer and it turned crusty because you never lowered your insulin. I have patients that are over overweight and we put them on a ketogenic we put them on a 20 total carbohydrates per day. So super low carbohydrate. It is 15 days before they make a ketone.</p>

### 生酮的好处：更清洁的大脑燃料

**主持人：** 除了我们谈到的胰岛素原因外，酮体作为一种能量来源对我来说在性能方面还有什么更好的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are there any reasons why ketone as a source of energy is better for me in terms of performance other than the insulin reasons that we've talked about?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 首先，当你燃烧酮体时，产生的垃圾更少。它是一种更清洁的燃料，副产品更少，尤其是在你变老的时候。所以你能获得更持久的能量，而且周围漂浮的碎片也更少。你总是听到“抗氧化剂”这个词。嗯，燃烧酮体就是一种抗氧化状态。而且它发生在你需要的地方，也就是细胞内部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For starters, when you're burning a ketone, there's less trash. Okay? It is a cleaner uh fuel with less byproduct especially as you age. So you get the longer energy and you have less debris floating around. You hear the word antioxidants all the time. Well, burning ketones is an antioxidant state. It is a and it's in the space where you need it, which is inside that cell.</p>
</details>

它能持续更长时间，并且能穿透血脑屏障，为大脑提供燃料，即使大脑有胰岛素抵抗，它也能使用酮体。对于慢性胰岛素抵抗的人来说，问题在于他们的大脑需要大量的葡萄糖来维持运转。我可以试着把葡萄糖送到那里，但胰岛素一直在与之对抗。这是一场战争。我的窍门是酮体可以直接绕过这个问题。它不需要相同的转运蛋白来穿过血脑屏障，尤其是为大脑中的那些细胞提供燃料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It lasts longer and it penetrates through that bloodb brain barrier to fuel a brain that even if it's insulin resistant, it can use a ketone. So the problem with somebody who's chronic insulin resistance, their brain needs a lot of glucose to stay on online. and I can try to get it there, but insulin is constantly fighting that. It's a war to try and keep the glucose in their brain. My hack is ketones will go right around that. It doesn't need the same transporters to get across the bloodb brain barrier and especially to fuel those cells in the brain.</p>
</details>

所以，在性能方面，我是说，有哪个游戏你不用动脑子吗？没有，对吧？如果你追求性能，那就从最敏锐的大脑、最强的专注力、最强的纪律性和最少的冲动性开始。当大脑以酮体为燃料时，所有这些都会得到改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, for performance, um I mean, name a game where you don't use your brain. There isn't one, right? you're you're gonna if you're looking at performance to say let's begin with the sharpest brains and the most focus, the most discipline, the less um impulsivity. All of those things improve when that brain is being fueled with ketones.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那么，作为一个我猜现在正处于生酮饮食中的人，你个人注意到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what have you personally noticed as someone who I assume is in the ketogenic diet right now?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。我从 2015 年就开始这么做了。当你处于生酮状态和非生酮状态时，脑力、专注力、控制情绪的能力，简直是天壤之别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Right. Well, I've been doing this since 2015. um when you're in a ketogenic state and not in a ketogenic state, uh the the the brain power, the concentration, the ability to keep your mood controlled is is just it is a night and day difference for most people.</p>

### 生酮与认知衰退：阿尔茨海默症的新希望

**主持人：** 像阿尔茨海默症、痴呆症等这些认知退化性疾病与生酮饮食之间有联系吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And is there a link between some of these cognitive degeneration diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, etc., and the ketogenic diet? Cuz I know that there's been some research that's underway and has been done to try and establish causality. Is there a link here?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。这是最令人悲伤的地方之一。当病人走进诊所，开始说：“我前几天开车，结果迷路了。” 当我听到这个时，我们已经晚了 15 年。那是 15 年来大脑中垃圾的堆积，我们必须清理掉那些碎片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You know, it's one of the saddest places where if you look at what patients regret in life, they come into the clinic and they're already starting to say, "I was driving the other day and I I got lost." And when I hear that, we are 15 years too late. It is 15 years of building up trash in that brain that we have to clean out that debris.</p>
</details>

我有一个唐氏综合症患者，40 岁。她的母亲先来找我，说：“我想试试这种生酮饮食。我一直在帮助我患有唐氏综合症的女儿。我们减掉了 100 磅，因为医生说如果减掉一些体重她可能会好一些。” 唐氏综合症患者通常有严重的胰岛素抵抗和更早发生的阿尔茨海默症。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I had a Down syndrome patient at 40 years old uh in my practice. So her mother came to see me first. She said, "I I want to try this ketogenic diet. Um, I've been helping my daughter who's has Down syndrome. We've lost 100 pounds uh because the doctor said that she might do better if um if we lost some weight and it's not an uncommon thing to see. They have advanced insulin resistance and advanced Alzheimer's earlier in life.</p>
</details>

这位女士来了，她减掉了 100 磅，但在此期间，她的认知能力变得更差了。所以现在她减掉了 100 磅，但那些大脑方面的问题一点也没好转。我说：“好吧，如果我们要和你女儿一起做，我们要确保我们是动真格的，我们会扎手指测血酮，进行真正的生酮饮食。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the woman comes, she's lost 100 pounds, and during that time, her mental cognition got worse. So, now she's got 100 pounds down, but none of those brain things are better. And I said, "All right, if we're going to do this with your daughter, we're going to make sure we're pricking your finger. It's not going to be fake. We're going to do a real ketogenic diet."</p>
</details>

几天之内，她们的酮体水平就达到了 3.0 左右，而一般人几天内能达到 1.0 我就觉得很不错了。周末，母亲打电话给我说：“你觉得它可能这么快就起作用吗？她开始做以前在家里做的一些小活了。” 我说：“嗯，一周后再给我打电话，看看她怎么样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">cuz they have ketones of like three within a couple of days, which is the average would be like one if I if they hit one in a few days. I'm thinking, good job. And the mom calls me at the end of the week saying, "Do you think it could possibly work this fast? She is she's, you know, doing the little jobs that she used to do around the house." And I said, "Well, call me again in a week. Let's see how she's doing."</p>
</details>

然后母亲说：“最深刻的事情刚刚发生了。我照顾这个女孩 41 年了。前几天我问她一件事。她想和我一起去教堂，这意味着她离开了家，在教堂里。我给她指令去做这个，绕到这边，把它放到那边，给她一个小任务。然后我问她：‘你明白吗？’ 那个女孩回答说：‘我明白（I understand）。’”

<details>

<p class="english-text">And the mom goes, "The most profound thing just happened. I've taken care of this girl for 41 years. And I asked her the other day if she was doing something.

And she said, "Do you understand?" And the girl replied, "I understand."</p>
</details>

我问：“这有什么大不了的？” 母亲说，她一生中从未说过一个三音节的词。她的大脑最多只能组合两个音节。这是她有生以来第一次，在生酮饮食三周后。这个被诊断为阿尔茨海默症的唐氏综合症患者，现在大脑不仅运转良好，而且是她母亲见过的最好的状态。在生酮饮食下，她不仅又减掉了大约 15 到 20 磅，而且她的世界再次向她敞开，因为她的大脑，虽然曾患有阿尔茨海默症，但现在不再有那个诊断了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said, "What's the big deal?" And the mother said she had never said a three syllable word in her whole life. Two syllables is all her brain could ever put together. For the first time in her whole life, three weeks onto a ketogenic diet. And this Alzheimer's diagnosed patient who had Down syndrome now had a brain that was not only working great, it was doing the best mom had ever seen it. And on a ketogenic diet, not only did she lose about 15 to 20 more pounds, but her world opened up again because her brain, which had Alzheimer's, no longer had that diagnosis.</p>

### 实操指南：如何测量酮体并进入生酮状态

**主持人：** 我如何测量我的血酮水平？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do I measure my blood ketone levels?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 当我看到病人时，我会让他们愿意检查数据。血液检测比任何其他方式都好。我们来比一下，看看谁的更好？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean when I look at um uh giving patients the freedom to say don't don't come to me for the things that I that you can do at home. First thing is be willing to check data. Okay. Okay. So, blood way better than any other way to measure this. We're going to be able to see. Should we have a contest? Which one's better?</p>
</details>

*（主持人与博斯沃思博士现场进行了血酮和血糖测试）*

**主持人：** 我的血糖是 86，酮体水平是 0.9。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my glucose is 86. And my ketone levels are.9.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 你的血糖水平 86，这很好。不是低，就是好。你的酮体水平是 0.9。当你比较它们时，你希望血糖不是三位数。所以这非常好。酮体水平高于 0.5 越多，结果越好。所以这是个相当不错的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's good. Uh so I would say that's not low, it's just good. Right? So when you look at them in comparison, like you want to have a blood sugar that's not triple digit. So that's very good. And the closer the higher you are above 0.5, the better the result. So that's pretty good number.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 如果我处于酮症状态，这个酮体计上会显示什么读数？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I'm in ke ketosis, what reading would I have on this ketone meter?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 0.5 或更高。但同时你的血糖不能是三位数。所以我看它们的组合，我会做一点计算，说你的“博士比率”大概是 95。所以你现在正在燃烧脂肪。这是个好迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">0.5 or greater. But it would be also that you have that reading without a triple digit blood sugar. So when I look at the combination of them, I do a little math and say your Dr. ratio is like 95. So you are burning fat right now. Okay. So that's a good sign.</p>
</details>

*（博斯沃思博士测试自己的数据）*

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 83 和 1.7。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">83 and 1.7.</p>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 我已经学会了，我真希望自己能再回到 33 岁，能够那么晚吃饭。我学会了在早上进食，摄入高脂肪和优质蛋白质的健康卡路里，并且我学会在下午三点左右停止进食。

### 生酮连续体：终身保持生酮状态的12个步骤

**主持人：** 你有一个“生酮连续体”的概念。它是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have this idea of this keto continuum. What is the ketone continuum?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 生酮连续体是一个 12 步的过程，让你能持续地处于生酮状态，不断地清理垃圾。第一部分是初学者阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the keto continuum is this 12step process, to get into a consistent keto. Consistently keto. Yeah. That you're constantly taking out the trash. The first part is the beginner.</p>
</details>

第一步其实不是生酮，而是他们每两到三个小时吃一次东西。如果他们偏离了轨道，通常会回到这里。这是大多数人开始的地方。第二步是把你的碳水化合物减少到 20 克。这是我唯一需要你测量的事情。你将能够使用酮试纸，在尿液中测量酮体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I like to tell patients that you never fall all the way off of the continuum. So, the first part the first step is really not keto, but it is that they're eating every two to three hours. And if they fall off the wagon, that's usually where they land. So, that's what most people start at. They're eating every two to three hours. They are not keeping their carbs less than 20. Step two is cut your carbs to 20. That's the only thing I need you to measure. And you're going to be able to use a ketone strip, you know, measure ketones in your urine.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 当我们进入生酮连续体的第五阶段时，上面写着 16:8。这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, day 10 and then it says when we get to stage five in the keto continuum, it says 168 168. Is that</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。然后我们开始使用时间限制性进食。你的身体会适应。人们说你无法坚持生酮饮食，是因为他们到了第四步就以为自己已经完成了所有需要做的事情。要逆转这个问题有好几个步骤。我们会学习一些新的行为。我们将学习在一天中至少 16 个小时里什么都不吃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, then we start to use timerestricted eating uh where I want I mean we're going to your body will adapt. People say you can't stay on the keto diet because they go to step four and then they think that that's all they needed to do. There are several steps to reversing this problem and you'll know you have the right step if the ketones are still present in your gut in your blood. Your body will adapt though. So, we start to say, "All right, we're going to learn some new behaviors. We're going to learn what the nothing burger looks like at least for 16 hours out of the day."</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 然后我们到了第七阶段，上面写着 23:1。这是指一天禁食 23 小时，进食 1 小时吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we get to stage seven where it says 231. Is that fasting for 23 hours a day and eating for 1 hour a day?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。然后最后的阶段，第九、十、十一和十二步，是 36 到 72 小时的长时间禁食。那些有 15、20 年高胰岛素病史的人，他们中的大多数人将不得不进行 36 小时的“零食汉堡”（完全禁食），才能真正给他们的新陈代谢一个好的重置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the there's a little bitty line between 168 and 23 in1, but there's a whole bunch of life there. Meaning, we don't actually have patients go from 16 hours of fasting uh to 23. We have them slide it down by an hour, slide it down by an hour, and then we do that harder thing, which is move it towards sunrise. Quit eating so late at night. And then the last stage here, so so step 9, 10, 11, and 12 is prolonged fasting between 36 and 72-hour fasting.</p>
</details>

### 沙丁鱼挑战：快速进入生酮的强大工具

**主持人：** 你为什么带了沙丁鱼来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we have 12 cans of sardines here and uh I I I wondered why you you brought sardines with</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。那是个绝佳的工具。当你想帮助病人改变行为时，他们不关心你刚才读的那些数据。他们需要一个非常明确的步骤来开始。当你和一个似乎无法让酮体水平上升的病人合作时，我给他们一长串菜单会太嘈杂。让我们把它简化为一种食物，它富含脂肪，富含一些最好的脂肪，富含蛋白质，是天然食物，而且对每个人来说都负担得起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, yes. That's a hell of a tool. When you're trying to teach patients, those stats that you read off a minute ago, they don't care. They need a very clear step on how do I begin. And when you're working with somebody who cannot seem to get their ketones to rise, and I give them a whole list of menus that's too noisy, let's take it down to one food that is high in fat, high in some of the best fats, high in protein, it's whole foods, and it's affordable for everybody under the sun.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 所以你做的是像沙丁鱼断食？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, you do you do like a sardine fast?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。在我为期三周的高级生酮饮食课程中，在第六天，我说：“好了，接下来三天菜单上唯一的东西就是沙丁鱼。” 没有进食窗口，你想吃多少就吃多少，没有数量限制。我推动他们做的不仅是吃一种营养密集的食物，我还希望他们感到饱足感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So in fact that that 21 day I mean 21 day is that three-week course where I say I will teach you how to do an advanced ketogenic diet where everybody will be peeing ke or making abundant ketones. On day six uh I say all right the only thing on the menu for the next three days is sardines. There's no eating window. You can eat as much as you want. There's no limit to the amount. And what I'm pushing them to do is not only eat a nutrient-dense food but I want them to feel satiety. I want them to feel full.</p>
</details>

### 补充剂策略：维生素D、镁和外源性酮体

**主持人：** 关于补充剂，你每天都离不开的关键补充剂是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about supplementation? What are the key supplements that you don't live without on a daily basis?</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 维生素 D 是一个非常重要的补充剂。它是一种激素，能与你身体里的每一个细胞对话，告诉那个细胞成为最好的自己。不幸的是，它是由脂肪构成的。所以如果你有高胰岛素，它就会被困在你的脂肪细胞里，到不了它该去的细胞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vitamin D turns out to be a really important one. It's a hormone, right? A hormone that goes and talks to every one of the cells in your body. and it tells that cell to be its best version of itself. Unfortunately, it's made of fat. So, if you have high insulin, it gets stuck parked in your fat cells and it didn't get to the cell.</p>
</details>

我还认为全世界的人都缺镁。镁就像我们身体里的火花塞。它是一种小金属，ATP 的循环需要它，几乎每一种酶都需要它。但我们的食物中含量很低，土壤中含量也很低。你必须补充它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the whole world's low on magnesium. Magnesium. Yeah. So, magnesium is required for every little It's like the spark plug in our bodies. It's a little metal and it's how ATP gets recycled and you need it for almost every enzyme. But our food is low in it. Our foods, our soil is low on it. You just got to replace it.</p>
</details>

还有，我真的会推动我的病人身边常备酮体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, uh I Stephen, I really push my patients to have ketones around.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你说的酮体是指外源性酮体吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What? When you say ketones, you mean external exogenous ketones. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 是的。当你自己制造酮体时，它的量会更丰富。但是当你像人们常做的那样，偏离了轨道，或者你有很强的胰岛素抵抗，你的身体正在努力追赶以达到平衡时，你希望将酮体重新注入循环中，因为它会激发你的肝脏制造酮体。所以对于有慢性胰岛素抵抗和慢性问题的病人来说，这真的是一个启动器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you make it, it is much more abundant. But when you do what people do, they fall off the wag again or they're very insulin resistant, so their body is trying to catch up to to equilibrate, you want ketones put back in circulation because it will spark their liver to make ketones. So it really is a jump start for patients with chronic insulin resistance, chronic problems.</p>
</details>

### 个人故事：用生酮饮食拯救母亲

**安妮特·博斯沃思博士：** 我母亲是我今天在这里的原因。2015 年，在我给予了我知道的最好的医疗保健十年后，这位最固执的病人走进了门。她面色灰白，看起来像个僵尸，脖子上有很大的淋巴结。你不需要是医生也知道她快要死了。她的癌症又复发了。

And she's gray and she looks like a zombie and she's got big lymph nodes in her neck. You don't need to be a doctor to know that she's dying. Her cancer was back again.</p>
</details>

我们去看肿瘤医生，他说：“你需要化疗。” 她说：“为什么，卡尔，你前两次给我做化疗，我都不知道缝纫机是什么了。” 她在我 10 岁之前的所有衣服都是她做的。她很紧张，因为如果我们什么都不做，她只有 6 个月可活。她问我一个问题：“如果是你，你会怎么做？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we go to see the oncologist uh and he says, "You need chemotherapy." And she says, "Why Cal, the last two times you did that to me, I didn't know what a sewing machine was." And she made all of my clothes until I was the age of 10. And she's nervous because she has 6 months to live if we don't do something. And she asks me a question that lots of patients have asked me this question. I just sometimes lie. She said, "If it was you, what would you do?"</p>
</details>

我当时一直在阅读关于生酮饮食对脑损伤的研究，也看到了一些关于它对癌症患者，尤其是像她这样的胰岛素驱动型癌症患者能做什么的研究。我说：“妈妈，你相信我吗？” 她说：“我用我的整个生命相信你。”

</details>

医生走进来，把一张纸滑到我面前说：“你是怎么让她的癌症指标下降 70% 的？市场上没有任何药物能做到这一点。” 化疗本可以使指标下降 30%，而生酮饮食在 6 周内使其下降了 70%。她从一个看起来像 100 岁的 70 岁老人，变成了一个看起来像 40 岁的 75 岁老人。
