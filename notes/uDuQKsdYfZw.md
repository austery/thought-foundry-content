### 跨越体育与商业的边界

**Chris**: 体育界只有四位亿万富翁：**LeBron**、**Jordan**、**Tiger**，然后就是我们眼前的这位——来自中西部的传奇控球后卫，32号，**魔术师约翰逊 (Magic Johnson)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: There's only four billionaire people in sports. You have LeBron, you have Jordan, you have Tiger, and then we got... Introducing the towering point guard from the Midwest. Number 32, Magic Johnson.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 我能做到这一点，不仅仅是因为体育，大部分是源于商业。我不只是想在体育上赢——我已经拿到了 **18 枚总冠军戒指**——我也想在商业上赢。我会竭尽所能，确保每一笔交易或每一个合作伙伴关系都能胜出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: How you did it was not just sports, but majority from business. I don't just want to win in sports, which I have 18 championship rings. I also want to win in business. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that deal or that partnership wins.

</details>

**Chris**: 没错。当我们以 **22 亿美元**买下**道奇队 (Dodgers)** 时，所有人都说我们买贵了，现在它价值 80 亿。**指挥官队 (Commanders)** 买入两年，现在价值 60 亿。随着新体育场的建成，估值还会更高。我们在体育上投入了巨资，因为在美国，没有人会停止观看体育比赛。现在很多公司都在寻求收购球队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Yes. When we bought the Dodgers 2.2 billion where everybody said we overpaid. Now it's 8 billion. The Commanders is 2 years old now. 6 billion. And now that the new stadium that's going to go even up higher. We pour so much money into sports. And nobody's ever going to stop watching sports in America. Right now you got companies looking to buy teams.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 体育一直是一种资产类别，但现在人们真正看到了它的长期现实。以前大多数富人离开时都会带走他们的知识，他们不分享。但今天的节目涵盖了一切，电视上没有其他人能像你我刚才那样涵盖所有这些话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: It's always been an asset class, but now people really see the long-term reality. Most of the rich people before us took the knowledge with them. They didn't share it. This show right here today, we covered everything. There's nobody else on TV that can cover all the things you and I just covered.

</details>

### 导师制度与“奥维茨测试”

**Chris**: 很高兴你能来。我认为这非常重要，这几乎是过去 10 年从投资到对话的结晶。你来到旧金山谈论风险投资，扩展投资组合。你是顶级的交易撮合者和企业家，这与我们 **a16z** 的生态系统不谋而合。我觉得没有比请你来更好的方式来架起这两个世界的桥梁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: I'm glad you're able to come through today, man. I think this is important for a lot of people and a lot of different reasons, too. Look, I think that, you know, like you said, this is a culmination, I think almost 10 years of from investments to conversations to, you know, having you come up to San Francisco talking about venture, expanding the portfolio and we wanted really just to take the time today because, you know, you are one of the ultimate deal makers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, and that's also the same ecosystem that we have here at A16Z. And I felt like there was no better way to have a conversation that bridged both worlds than to have you come on today.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 谢谢你带我入行。很多时候，需要有人拉你一把，或者确保你能看到交易和机会。我要感谢你这 10 年来让我有机会投资这些伟大的项目。你作为一名高管和交易撮合者，带入了这么多艺术家和运动员，他们现在因为你而可以称自己为商人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Again, thank you because you brought me in though. You know, I think a lot of times, somebody has to pull your coattail or somebody has to make sure that you can see deals or you can see opportunities. And I want to thank you for 10 years making sure that I've had a chance to see these great opportunities that I've been have a chance to invest in. So again, you being in there, being an executive, being a dealmaker yourself and then bringing in so many different artists and athletes who now can say they're businessmen or business women because of you.

</details>

**Chris**: 我在投资方面起了一定作用，让大家了解硅谷，理解**股权 (Equity)** 与**代言 (Endorsements)** 的区别，但你才是真正的先驱。我刚进硅谷时的第一位导师是 **Michael Ovitz**。有趣的是，a16z 的模式其实是建立在 **CAA** 模型之上的，Ovitz 曾是 **Ben Horowitz** 公司董事会的成员。我刚开始工作时，我的职位代号甚至叫“小奥维茨”。他告诉我，第一年每天都要安排早、中、晚三场会议，一年后再告诉他学到了什么。这让我理解了如何建立人脉。他也曾和你深谈过，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Well, it's not I might have played a big part on the investment side in terms of getting people into Silicon Valley and getting them and understanding, you know, the benefits of equity versus endorsements, but you know, you were the one that actually pioneered, you know, getting into business itself. And, you know, a funny story that actually inspired me and I think that we have one tie-in from the very beginning. And that's actually one of my first mentors when I first got into Silicon Valley, and that was actually Michael Ovitz. And so I don't know if you know that, but the firm was actually built off of CAA's model and Ovitz was on the board of Ben's company. And so that's where they originally got the idea for A16Z and having a service-based model. When I first got the job, my position was actually a code word. It was called "mini Ovitz." Ben was like, we can't call you mini Ovitz. The funny story is that he told me, "Chris, first order of business, I need you to have a breakfast, lunch and dinner meeting every single day for a year and then come back to me and let me know what you learned." It was really important to understand how to build a network. But I say that because he also first talked to you when you were thinking about getting into the game.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 是的。我告诉湖人队老板 **Jerry Buss** 博士我想成为商人，他成了我的第一位导师。他告诉我：“你需要去见一个叫 Michael Ovitz 的人，他是洛杉矶乃至全国的顶级交易撮合者。” 我联系了他，他让我过去。我下午 2 点到的，一直等到 5 点。他见到我后的第一句话是：“我不知道该不该代理你。运动员花的比赚的多，我不知道你是否认真，是否有经商的潜质。” 然后他直接把我赶了出去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Yeah. I told Dr. Jerry Buss, the owner of the Lakers, that I wanted to become a businessman. He became my first mentor. But then he told me, "Listen, you need to meet a guy named Michael Ovitz." The King Deal maker. In Los Angeles and in the country, right? And so I said, "Okay." So I reached out to Michael Ovitz and I said, "Hey, I would like to take a meeting with you because I want to become a businessman after my playing career is over." And he said, "All right, come on in." So Chris, I get there and I think the meeting was around 2 o'clock. Of course, I'm early for everything. So I got there about 1 and I'm sitting in the lobby. It's 3:00. It's 4:00. And now finally it's 5. So the assistant come out and get me and I go into his office and he shakes my hand. And the first thing he says, "You know, I don't know about representing you. Athletes, they spend more money than they make. I don't know if you're serious. I don't know if you have what it takes to become a businessman. I represent everybody in Hollywood. Nice meeting you." And he threw me out.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 几周后，他回电说：“我调查过你了，Buss 博士说你是认真的。回来吧。” 他给了我一叠杂志让我读，并说要考考我。如果通过测试，他才会考虑代理我。我当天就读完了。通过测试后，他开始带我跑遍全城，见各种人。他教会了我不仅是商业，还有**交易的艺术**，以及建立庞大**人脉网 (Rolodex)** 的重要性——你今天可能不需要这些人，但明天可能会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: A couple weeks later, he calls back and he says, "I checked you out. And Dr. Buss told me that you were serious. Come back." So, I came back and he had a stack of magazines and he said, "Here, you read these. And I'm gonna give you a test. And if you pass the test, then I'll think about representing you." So, of course, I went back and read them all. I passed the test and he said, "I see you're serious about becoming a businessman." So he took me all around town. Meeting everybody. He taught me so much not just about business about just the art of deal making and and also making sure you have a long and big rolodex. You know and you might not need the people today but you may need them tomorrow.

### 错失的耐克“十亿美金”教训

**Chris**: 在我们的业务中，有三个阶段：发现交易、决定投资，以及最重要的一步——**赢得交易**。这关乎执行力。而且很多时候，这取决于关系。风险投资是一场长跑，你必须先给予才能有所收获。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Well, I mean because even on our business there's three different sides. First you have to be able to see the deal. The next stage is saying okay I actually want to make that investment. But the third stage is actually the most important stage which is winning the deal. You know in terms of being able to identify those right opportunities and then being able to execute. Execution and more execution. A lot of it really does come down to relationships. In venture, it's a very long-term game. You have to give first in order to have these things happen.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 没错。我与 **Ron Burkel** 建立了极好的关系，我们在做私募股权交易前认识了 10 年。他教会了我关于客户服务的一切。我也很幸运能拥有像 **Howard Schultz** 这样的伙伴，我们合作了 125 家**星巴克 (Starbucks)** 门店。他教会了我边际利润和商业运作。我总是问我的合伙人：“你想让我在这个合作中扮演什么角色？” 我会超额完成任务。在商业中，我愿意做一个“角色球员”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Yeah, you're right because I built a fabulous relationship with Ron Burkel. I knew Ron for 10 years before we actually did a deal together. When you think about customer service, that's what really it taught me everything I needed to know about customer service. Having a great partner and going into Starbucks and really understanding the business side of it. Your margins were incredible. I've been blessed to create not only great partnerships, but also having these people as friends. So I really look at it like when you come into business with these people, you have to play your role and do your part. I tell them, "What role do you want me to play in this partnership?" So I'mma overdeliver to you and to the company. Now I'm playing a role player in business with these men.

</details>

**Chris**: 这种“海绵式”的学习态度非常重要，不仅限于一个行业，而是跨越多个垂直领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: I think one of the things that you can be a sponge of is not just one specific industry but multiple different verticals.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 没错。我投资的项目通常都不“性感”。大家都在找最火的公司，但那些公司往往起伏很大。而那些**枯燥的业务 (Boring businesses)**，人们不关注，但它们在持续盈利和增长。这就是我想待的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: There was nothing sexy about anything that I invested in. Boring businesses keep... that's a secret. Everybody wants to find the hottest company and sometimes that might be a trend. But the ones that are boring and people don't know about or care about, those are the ones who are on a consistent making money or going up, you have growth. And so that's where I want to be.

</details>

**Chris**: 谈到错失的交易，风投界有“贝比·鲁斯效应”：三振出局最多的人，往往本垒打也最多。你经商 32 年，有没有哪次让你记忆深刻的“错失”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: No one bats a thousand. We have the Babe Ruth effect where I have the highest number of strikeouts, but you also have the highest number of home runs. Do you have one in your memory where you missed the deal or looked at it wrong?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 那绝对是 **Nike**。当我年轻时，他们想签我，但给的是**股票 (Stock)** 而不是现金。**Phil Knight** 当时说：“我没有其他公司那么多钱，但我有股票。” 如果我在 1979 年接了那笔交易，按照现在的分析，那笔股权价值将超过 **10 亿美元**。那真是“跑掉的大鱼”。但我从不回头看，我总是向前看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Yeah, Chris, there's always deals that you wish that you had wrote the check and you didn't. And then you have a deal like Nike when I was young and they wanted to sign me but give me stock. Phil Knight said, "I don't have the money they have, but I got stock." If I had did that deal in 1979, it'd be over a billion dollars. So that's the one that got away, man. But at the same time, I'm not a guy who goes backwards a lot. I move forward.

</details>

### 进军硅谷与技术布局

**Chris**: 10 年前，我们一起投资了 **Skydio** 无人机。当时无人机还只是原型机，你为什么会对硅谷感兴趣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: When we first met, we met in Silicon Valley when we were doing the Skydio deal. What was the interest when you were thinking about expanding your business portfolio to get into startups and Silicon Valley when nobody else was really doing it?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 我当时在寻找下一个增长机会。我看到所有的资金都在流向硅谷，我想：“我该如何进入那个世界？” 然后你出现了。我需要一个敲门砖，你和 Ben 提供了这个机会。Skydio 当时还在原型阶段，这让我非常兴奋。这为我在硅谷建立了成功记录，打开了其他大门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Well, first of all, I was looking for what's the next growth opportunity for me and my company. So I said, "Wow, all the money is going towards Silicon Valley. How do I get into that world?" And then here you come. I just needed that foot in the door. You provided that foot in the door for me and Ben as well. Here comes this opportunity with Skydio and the drones. The product wasn't even... it was still in prototype. That deal provided me with a track record in Silicon Valley and then opened up the doors for me to see other opportunities.

</details>

**Chris**: 现在无人机无处不在，从体育联赛到国防合同。我们在趋势之前就看到了它。你在选择创始人时看重什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Now they use drones for everything. We were way ahead of the curve. What do you look for in founders or the next entrepreneur that's trying to have you become their investor?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 首先，它是否是市场上没有的东西？10 年后它还会存在吗？它有增长潜力吗？最后，我们是否有机会退出或出售？我希望创始人有“**利益相关 (Skin in the game)**”，并且是该领域的专家。同时，我们能否带来**附加值 (Added value)**？利用我的网络和专业知识让公司腾飞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Well, I think first of all, is it something that is not in the marketplace? Can we really look at this 10 years from now that it's going to still be here? It has growth potential. And then do we have a chance to exit or sell down the line? I want these founders to have skin in the game. They also are experts at what they do. And then we also look at it: Can we bring added value? Being Magic Johnson, all the things that we have in our toolbox, can we bring added value to the deal or to that founder and make that company grow?

</details>

### 体育资产的爆发式增长

**Chris**: 现在的运动员和艺人越来越聪明，他们更看重股权而不是代言费。你如何看待 **AI** 和区块链等新技术的演变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Now you're seeing some of the most high-profile celebrities owning their own brands. How are you seeing those worlds like AI and blockchain develop?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 技术在不断进步。AI 将会让人们大吃一惊，它只会变得更好。每个人都在把资金转向 AI。我告诉年轻人，必须尽早入局。看谁在领投，如果成功记录良好的人写了支票，我也会跟进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Technology just keeps going and growing. AI now is going to blow people's mind. It's only going to get better. I think everybody's now moving money to invest in AI. I say to everybody, you got to get in early. Look who else is investing. If they got a track record of success and they wrote a check, I'm writing my check.

</details>

**Chris**: 你最近投资了 **Alchemy Health** 和 **Function Health**，这些是 AI 与生物技术的交叉领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: You've recently had an opportunity to join the cap table on Alchemy Health and also with Function Health. You're developing an amazing portfolio in the intersections of AI and bio.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 没错，因为有巨大的需求。在医疗荒漠地区，人们需要药房。AI 也能帮助各行各业降低成本、提高效率。我希望我的公司处于最前沿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Yeah, because there's heavy demand. Just like you look at AI, it's heavy demand for it across every industry, it's going to help everybody. Lower your cost, you're going to be more efficient. I want to make sure companies are on the cutting edge.

</details>

**Chris**: 谈谈体育。你买下道奇队时花了 22 亿，现在值 80 亿。湖人队曾以 6500 万美元买入，现在价值 100 亿。为什么体育估值会持续飙升？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: Let's just break down when we bought the Dodgers 2.2 billion. Now it's 8 billion. Dr. Buss bought the Lakers for $65 million. They just sold for $10 billion. Why do the valuations of these teams continue to skyrocket?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 因为在美国，没有人会停止观看体育。那是我们的释放，是逃离日常工作的出口。流媒体的加入让这些联赛增长更快，因为所有公司都想要体育内容。看看 **WNBA**，我们曾一直在亏损，但我们坚持了下来，现在球队价值 3 亿且在不断增长。**MLS** 也是如此，**LAFC** 的估值已经超过了 10 亿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Because nobody's ever going to stop watching sports in America. That's our release. That's our get away from our everyday work life. And then streaming came in. All those companies really allowed these leagues to grow because they all want sports content. Look at the WNBA, we were losing money. But we thought that someday it would change. Now the team is worth like $300 million and growing. Soccer in America, same thing. LAFC, valuation over a billion dollars.

</details>

### 给下一代的建议：组建团队与知识共享

**Chris**: 对于想要构建和扩展团队的创始人，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: For the founders that are thinking about building and scaling their teams, what is your methodology of thinking?

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 投资于**数据分析 (Analytics)** 和营销。在今天的体育界，没有数据分析你赢不了。同时要明确你的**身份 (Identity)**。最重要的是，要组建一个比你更聪明的专业团队。迈克尔·奥维茨总是提醒我：找比自己聪明的人，付给他们报酬，让他们放手去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: Invest in analytics and marketing. You got to have a whole staff because that's how you win in today. And then identity. What is your identity? Who are you? Michael always pointed that out to me: Get people who are smarter than yourself. Get the right people and always pay them and then let them do their thing.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 还有，不要害怕**合作 (Partner)**。必须打破“必须独占”的迷思。我和你是合伙人，你本可以不带我玩，但你带了。协作是 OK 的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: And then last but not least, don't be afraid to partner. See that myth, we got to get rid of that myth that you got to be the only one. You and I are partners. It's okay to collaborate.

</details>

**Chris**: 谢谢你的智慧。你一直是我的灵感来源，架起了商业与体育的桥梁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris**: I appreciate. You've been my inspiration behind everything when in terms of taking business and bridging these worlds together.

</details>

**Magic Johnson**: 少数族裔的弱点在于，以前的大多数富人带走了知识而没有分享。我很高兴能和你坐在这里教育和帮助他人。只要你愿意投入时间，一切皆有可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Magic Johnson**: The downfall of minorities have been most of the rich people before us took the knowledge with them, didn't share it. It's been a blessing man to sit here with you so that we can educate and also help others. It's doable if you put the time in.

</details>
