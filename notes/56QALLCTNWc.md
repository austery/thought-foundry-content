### 地缘政治巨震：委内瑞拉的剧变与美国战略重塑

2026年1月3日，新年伊始，全球地缘政治格局便迎来了一场“地震”。美国总统特朗普成功“移除”了委内瑞拉总统马杜罗，这一事件无疑是本周地缘政治领域最重磅的消息。此次行动不仅标志着美国在中美洲及南美洲地区影响力的一次强势扩张，也预示着全球力量平衡可能发生的深刻调整。

此次行动的背景是委内瑞拉长期以来严峻的经济和人道主义危机。作为拥有全球最大已探明石油储量的国家，委内瑞拉本应是地区强国，但由于长期的经济 mismanagement（管理不善）和左翼政权的治理不力，其石油产量锐减，经济几近崩溃。据联合国统计，约有20%的委内瑞拉人口（约700万人）已逃离国家，形成了严重的人道主义灾难。马杜罗政权在近期一次选举中本应落败，却通过非法手段巩固了其事实上的独裁地位，并与俄罗斯、伊朗等国保持紧密联系，与“特朗普团队”背道而驰。

此次军事行动由美国特种部队执行，目标直指马杜罗的住所，并成功将其及其妻子逮捕，随后被送往纽约接受美国法院审判。行动过程高效且几乎零伤亡，展现了美国军事力量的精准打击能力。此举直接导致了马杜罗政权的垮台，并实现了委内瑞拉的“政权更迭”。虽然这与特朗普“美国优先”的孤立主义口号有所不同，但它符合其“特朗普主义”的核心——即加强美国在拉丁美洲的控制力。此次行动的动机被认为是双重的：一是巩固美国在拉丁美洲的影响力，二是获取委内瑞拉丰富的石油资源。特朗普政府明确表示，此次行动不会耗费纳税人资金，而是将通过控制委内瑞拉的石油资源来收回成本。

Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 January
 3rd,


2026.
 I
 want
 to
 wish
 everyone
 a
 happy


new
 year.
 Now
 before
 we
 begin,
 I
 want
 to


bring
 to
 your
 attention
 that
 I've


noticed
 that
 some
 of
 you
 are
 not


receiving
 weekly
 updates
 from
 my
 blog


posts.
 I've
 looked
 into
 this
 and


discovered
 that
 this
 is
 a
 technical


problem
 and
 hopefully
 I
 will
 have
 this


resolved
 by
 Monday.
 But
 remember,
 you


can
 always
 access
 my
 posts
 on
 my
 website


and
 of
 course
 whenever
 I
 have
 a
 new


post,
 I
 will
 tweet
 about
 it
 on
 Twitter.


Okay,
 so
 this
 week
 I
 actually
 had


initially
 planned
 to
 make
 it
 a


geopolitical
 episode
 since
 we
 had
 so


many
 big
 things
 happening
 in
 the
 world


of
 geopolitics
 the
 past
 week.
 Little
 did


I
 know
 what
 we
 would
 have
 this
 huge
 huge


event
 that
 happened
 this
 morning
 where


it
 seems
 like
 President
 Trump
 has


successfully
 taken
 out
 President
 Maduro


of
 Venezuela.
 So
 this
 is
 definitely
 an


earthquake
 in
 the
 world
 of
 geopolitics.


So
 we
 got
 to
 talk
 about
 uh
 what
 happened


and
 what
 it
 all
 means
 for
 the
 economy


and
 for
 markets.
 And
 also
 we
 have
 to


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 silver
 as
 well.


So
 silver
 totally
 imploded
 uh
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 week.
 There
 are
 some


concrete
 causes
 for
 that
 although
 it
 did


recover
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 So
 first


though
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 happened
 in


the
 world
 of
 geopolitics.


So
 I
 think
 there
 are
 four
 theaters
 in


the
 world
 and
 in
 each
 geopolitical


theater
 we
 had
 some
 pretty
 big


developments
 from
 the
 far
 east
 to
 Latin


America
 to
 Europe
 to
 the
 Middle
 East.


Starting
 with
 the
 Far
 East.
 So
 earlier


in
 the
 week,
 last
 week,
 we
 had
 China


make
 pretty
 big
 military
 exercises
 all


around
 Taiwan.
 And
 what
 they
 seem
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 projecting
 is
 that


they
 could
 easily
 blockade
 Taiwan.
 And


if
 they
 were
 to
 blockade
 Taiwan,
 again,


Taiwan
 is
 an
 island,
 so
 it's
 not


self-sufficient
 in
 many
 things
 like
 oil.


Uh
 the
 ch
 the
 Taiwanese
 economy
 would


easily
 crumble
 and
 um
 it
 would
 be
 the


end
 of
 that
 pretty
 quickly.
 Now
 the


broader
 context
 of
 course
 is
 that
 not


too
 long
 ago
 you
 had
 Prime
 Minister


Tekachi
 of
 Japan
 make
 supportive


statements
 for
 Taiwan
 that
 really


angered
 the
 Chinese
 and
 you
 know


President
 Trump
 actually
 seemed
 to


reportedly
 intervene
 to
 maybe
 just


politely
 suggest
 the
 Japanese
 prime


minister
 to
 maybe
 moderate
 her
 stance
 a


little
 bit.
 Although
 by
 all
 reports
 uh


Japan
 still
 stands
 in
 support
 of
 Taiwan


in
 case
 of
 potential
 military
 conflict.


For
 context
 here,
 uh
 Taiwan
 was
 once
 a


Japanese
 colony.
 Many
 people
 in
 Taiwan


remember
 that
 period
 positively
 and
 look


upon
 Japan
 in
 a
 very
 positive
 light.
 But


of
 course,
 if
 you
 recall
 from
 the
 United


States's
 most
 recent
 national
 security


strategy,
 the
 US
 is
 basically
 viewing


the
 world
 as
 multipolar
 where
 every


country
 has
 your
 sphere
 of
 influence.


Very
 clearly
 the
 United
 States
 will
 have


a
 Trump
 correlary
 to
 the
 Monroal


doctrine.
 Latin
 America,
 North
 America


will
 be
 under
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 implication
 of


course
 is
 that
 the
 Far
 East,
 at least


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Taiwan,
 will
 be
 under


China
 and
 maybe
 Russia
 will
 have


Ukraine.


Now,
 moving
 on
 to
 Eastern
 Europe.


Earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 uh
 Russia
 loudly


complained
 that
 uh
 Ukraine
 will
 actually


launched
 a
 very
 mass-cale
 assassination


attempt
 on
 President
 Putin.
 Apparently,


there
 was
 a
 large
 fleet
 of
 Ukrainian


drones
 launched
 and
 Russia
 alleges
 that


these
 drones
 were
 targeted
 towards
 where


where
 President
 Putin
 was
 and
 it
 was
 an


assassination
 account.
 Putin
 actually


complained
 to
 Trump
 which
 then


complained
 to
 President
 Zalinski.
 Now,


the
 US
 it
 seems
 that
 reports
 suggest


have
 determined
 that
 this
 actually
 was


not
 an
 assassination
 attempt
 that
 maybe


they
 were
 targeting
 other
 military


installations
 in
 in
 Russia.
 But
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 Russia
 is
 claiming


this
 and
 perceiving
 this,
 then
 again,


that
 is
 an
 escalation
 in
 the
 Russia


Ukraine
 war
 and
 suggests
 that
 peace


talks
 are
 not
 going
 well
 and
 maybe
 it


could
 serve
 as
 a
 pretext
 for
 further


military
 escalation
 by
 the
 Russians.


Moving
 on
 to
 the
 Middle
 East,
 also


another
 very
 interesting
 development.


Now,
 you
 had
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 of
 Israel
 basically
 just,
 you


know,
 fly
 down
 to
 Mara
 Lago,
 hang
 out


with
 the
 president
 the
 fifth
 time.
 He's


done
 this
 this
 year.
 That's
 kind
 of
 a


record.
 And
 what
 usually
 happens,
 of


course,
 is
 that
 after
 these
 discussions,


you
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 geopolitical


escalation.


Now,
 it's
 no
 secret
 what
 Prime
 Minister


Netanyahu
 would
 like
 is
 to
 have
 more


military
 action
 on
 Iran,
 but
 of
 course,


they
 can't
 do
 that
 without
 the
 support


of
 the
 United
 States.
 Last
 time
 they


attacked
 Iran,
 Iran
 retaliated
 with


missiles
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 missiles


were
 intercepted
 by
 US
 um
 US
 support.


And
 so
 they
 really
 need
 the
 US
 to


protect
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 attack
 Iran.


Now
 reporting
 suggests
 that
 right
 now


what
 u
 Netanyahu
 is
 saying
 is
 that
 you


know
 Iran
 they
 have
 these
 ballistic


missiles.
 They
 can
 attack
 Israel.
 They


are
 a
 threat
 to
 us.
 We
 got
 to
 go
 and


take
 out
 that
 capability.
 Now
 notice
 now


that
 the
 goalposts
 are
 moving.
 initially


was
 that
 Iran
 could
 never
 have
 nuclear


weapons
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 take
 that
 out


and
 you
 know
 President
 Trump
 went
 and


bombed
 the
 nuclear
 facilities
 in
 Iran.


Now
 the
 standard
 is
 being
 lowered.
 It's


not
 that
 Iran
 can
 have
 nuclear
 weapons


is
 that
 they
 can't
 have
 ballistic


missiles
 and
 if
 uh
 the
 president
 agrees


with
 that
 lower
 standard
 then
 yes
 that


he's
 greenlighting
 more
 military
 attacks


in
 the
 Middle
 East.


But
 of
 course,
 the
 most
 interesting


geopolitical
 action
 we
 have
 is
 in
 Latin


America.
 Remember,
 not
 too
 long
 ago,
 the


Trump
 administration
 told
 the
 entire


world
 that
 Latin
 America
 belongs
 to
 us.


So,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 call
 the
 shots
 here.


Now,
 earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 uh
 the


president
 surprised
 the
 world
 by


revealing
 that
 the
 CIA
 actually
 carried


covert
 operations
 on
 Venezuelan
 soil.


Now,
 everyone
 knew
 that
 the
 US
 had
 a


Navy
 presence
 right
 outside
 of


Venezuela,
 that
 they
 had
 been
 blowing
 up


Venezuelan
 boats,
 but
 until
 earlier
 in


the
 week,
 they
 had
 not
 uh
 done
 anything


on
 Venezuelan
 soil.
 So,
 that
 was
 a
 very


clear
 escalation.
 A
 CIA
 bombing


facilities
 in
 Venezuelan
 ports.


This
 morning,
 it
 was
 revealed
 that


around
 2:00
 a.m.,
 US
 forces
 basically


flew
 in
 uh
 to
 where
 President
 Maduro
 of


Venezuela
 was
 staying.
 uh
 basically


kidnapped
 him
 and
 his
 wife,
 put
 him
 on
 a


ship,
 the
 USS
 Euima,
 and
 that
 ship
 is


now
 on
 route
 to
 New
 York
 where
 uh


President
 Madura
 will
 face
 the
 US


courts.
 Now,
 throughout
 this
 operation,


uh
 it
 was
 it
 was
 only
 a
 few
 hours.
 There


were
 reportedly
 zero
 US
 casualties.
 One


US
 helicopter
 was
 hit,
 but
 that
 US


copter
 continued
 to
 fly
 when
 it's
 able


to
 return
 uh
 to
 to
 its
 uh
 to
 the
 ships.


So
 this
 was
 an
 amazing
 amazingly
 precise


attack
 and
 amazingly
 successful.


Now
 by
 orchestrating
 this
 it
 all
 by


guarantees
 that
 the
 Maduro
 regime
 has


collapsed
 and
 that
 there
 will
 be
 regime


change
 in
 Venezuela.


So,
 uh,
 this
 is
 definitely
 not
 in
 line


with
 the
 America
 first
 ethos
 that


President
 Trump
 often
 campaigned
 on


where
 the
 US
 would
 not,
 um,
 you
 know,


intervene
 in
 foreign
 wars,
 nation


building
 and
 all
 that.
 But
 it
 does
 fall


under
 the
 Trump
 coralary
 of
 having
 more


power
 over
 the
 Latin
 America.
 Now,
 why


does
 Trump
 doing
 this?
 I
 think
 some
 some


context
 is
 helpful
 here.
 So,
 Venezuela,


if
 you
 look
 on
 a
 map,
 is
 actually
 a


pretty
 large
 country.
 uh
 it's
 in
 uh


South
 America.
 It's
 the
 land
 mass
 is


about
 say
 20
 30%
 larger
 than
 Texas
 and


has
 a
 population
 of
 about
 30
 million


about
 the
 same
 population
 as
 the
 state


of
 Texas.
 Venezuela
 of
 course
 is
 most


known
 for
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 oil.
 According


to
 studies
 it
 has
 the
 most
 uh
 the


largest
 oil
 reproven
 oil
 reserves
 in
 the


entire
 world.
 So
 it
 has
 the
 potential
 to


be
 an
 oil
 superpower.
 However,
 if
 you


look
 at
 its
 output
 data
 over
 the
 past


decade,
 you'll
 notice
 that
 Venezuela
 is


actually
 outputting
 much
 less
 oil
 today


than
 it
 did
 a
 decade
 ago.
 So,
 that


decline
 in
 oil
 output
 largely
 has
 to
 do


with
 just
 the
 tremendous
 tremendous


mismanagement
 of
 the
 Venezuelan
 economy.


If
 you
 look
 at
 a
 chart
 of
 Venezuelan


GDP,
 you
 know,
 a
 decade
 ago,
 things
 were


actually
 going
 really
 well.
 Now,
 oil


prices
 were
 going
 up.
 uh
 Venezuela
 was


pumping
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 and
 the
 country
 the


people
 were
 getting
 much
 wealthier.
 Now


that
 all
 ran
 into
 problems
 when
 the
 oil


price
 of
 oil
 collapsed
 and
 then
 you
 had


new
 change
 in
 regime
 a
 more
 left-wing


regime
 came
 to
 power
 in
 Caracus
 and
 they


did
 not
 do
 a
 very
 good
 job
 and
 what
 you


see
 is
 the
 complete
 implosion
 of
 the


Venezuelan
 economy.
 According
 to
 the


United
 Nations,
 about
 20%
 of
 Venezuelans


actually
 fled
 the
 country.
 Now,
 that's


like
 7
 million
 people.
 Uh,
 viral
 videos


at
 the
 time
 would
 show
 that
 many


Venezuelans
 were
 basically
 starving.
 You


can
 see
 them
 throwing
 rocks
 at
 cows,


trying
 to
 kill
 the
 cow
 to
 eat
 them.
 It


was
 very
 much
 a
 humanitarian
 disaster.


Now,
 you
 had
 Venezuelan
 refugees
 flood


the
 entire
 world.
 You
 have
 Venezuelan


refugees
 in
 Chile,
 um,
 in
 Colombia,


Mexico,
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Uh
 this
 was
 a
 tremendous


tremendous
 catastrophe.
 You
 had
 a


country
 that
 was
 doing
 on
 the
 upswing


just
 just
 totally
 destroyed
 and
 of


course
 the
 people
 Venezuelans
 did
 not


like
 that
 and
 ideally
 there
 would
 be
 a


mechanism
 for
 the
 people
 to
 change


course
 to
 have
 a
 new
 government.
 Of


course
 that
 was
 naturally
 through
 the


ballot
 box.
 Now
 Venezuela
 did
 recently
 a


few
 years
 ago
 have
 an
 election
 by
 all


accounts.
 President
 Maduro
 lost
 that


election
 in
 a
 big
 way
 for
 obvious


reasons.
 Um
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 he
 just


decided
 that
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 leave
 and


so
 basically
 became
 a
 de
 facto
 dictator


of
 Venezuela.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 who
 did
 a


terrible
 job
 ruined
 the
 lives
 of


millions
 of
 people
 ruined
 his
 country


and
 it's
 just
 not
 very
 popular.
 However


though
 and
 of
 course
 he's
 uh
 not
 friends


with
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 friends


with
 Russia,
 Iran
 and
 China.
 basically


friends
 with
 people
 who
 are
 not
 uh
 with


team
 Trump,
 team
 USA.


So
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 motivation
 for
 this


uh
 move
 is
 twofold.
 One
 of
 course
 is
 to


strengthen
 US
 influence
 in
 uh
 Latin


America


and
 secondly
 of
 course
 is
 for
 oil.
 Now,


in
 his
 uh
 in
 his
 press
 conference
 after


his
 president
 is
 is
 totally
 blunt.
 You


know,
 it's
 it's
 not
 like
 President
 Bush


going
 into
 Iraq
 and
 then
 not
 so
 much


telling
 you
 about
 the
 oil,
 although
 a


lot
 of
 US
 companies
 having
 big
 oil


contracts.
 It's
 that
 the
 US
 president
 is


telling
 you
 today,
 President
 Trump
 is


telling
 you
 today
 that
 Venezuela
 has


lots
 of
 oil
 and
 the
 US
 is
 going
 to
 have


control
 over
 it
 and
 it's
 this
 uh


operation
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 not
 going
 to


cost
 taxpayer
 money
 because
 uh
 the
 US
 is


going
 to
 get
 paid
 through
 oil.
 So,
 it's


very
 open
 about
 it.
 The
 US
 would
 like
 to


have
 more
 control
 over
 Venezuelan


resources.
 Now,
 a
 coup
 attempt
 has


always
 been
 telegraphed.
 Again,
 you
 had


that
 military
 flotillaa
 outside
 of


Venezuela.
 You
 also
 had
 the
 US


intelligence
 operations
 smuggle
 out


Venezuelan
 opposition
 leader
 Machado


smuggled
 her
 out
 into
 um
 to
 Sweden
 where


she
 could
 get
 her,
 you
 know,
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize,
 have
 more
 international


legitimacy.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 US
 has


basically
 changed
 its
 mind
 on
 that.
 She


was,
 you
 know,
 probably
 a
 plan
 B
 or
 plan


A
 or
 plan
 C
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 But


maybe
 looking
 at
 how
 successful
 the


operation
 was
 today,
 the
 president
 very


openly
 told
 everyone
 that
 actually
 the


US
 will
 run
 Venezuela.


>> We
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 involved
 with
 uh


having
 somebody
 else
 get
 in
 and
 we
 have


the
 same
 situation
 that
 we
 had
 for
 the


last
 long
 period
 of
 years.
 So
 we
 are


going
 to
 run
 the
 country
 until
 such
 time


as
 we
 can
 do
 a
 safe,
 proper
 and


judicious


transition.
 Eventually,


Trump
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 will
 give


Venezuelan
 back,
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 this


could
 be
 years
 or
 decades,
 and
 no
 one


knows
 when.


So,
 it
 looks
 like
 overnight
 it's
 not


just
 it
 was
 regime
 change
 of
 Venezuela,


but
 the
 US
 has
 a
 new
 territory.
 It
 will


be
 run
 by
 um
 you
 know,
 who
 knows,
 new


governor,
 new
 prime
 minister,
 protector


of
 Venezuela.
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 But
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future,
 uh,
 Venezuela
 will


be
 under
 US
 control
 and
 eventually
 it


looks
 like
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


investment
 into
 Venezuela
 and
 there's


going
 to
 be
 more
 oil
 flowing
 out.
 So,


this
 this
 is
 a
 big
 big
 big
 geopolitical


move
 and
 it
 has
 some
 winners
 and
 losers.


The
 clear
 winners
 of
 course
 are
 the
 US


oil
 companies.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 go
 in
 and
 uh
 operate
 on
 those


resources.
 Chevron
 was
 already
 there.


Uh,
 it
 looks
 like
 other
 people
 are
 going


to
 come
 in
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 very
 good


for
 the
 US
 oil
 industry.
 It's
 going
 to


be
 very
 good
 for
 inflation
 and
 the


global
 consumer.
 If
 you
 have
 Venezuela


there
 with
 all
 this
 oil,
 but
 just
 kind


of
 not
 having
 the
 infrastructure
 to
 be


able
 to
 extract
 it.
 Now
 the
 supply
 of


oil
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up.
 That's
 going
 to


mean
 down
 pressure
 on
 oil
 prices.
 Not


immediately,
 of
 course.
 It's
 going
 to


take
 time
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 the


facility
 set
 up,
 but
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 few


years,
 you
 can
 easily
 see
 the
 supply
 of


oil
 go
 up,
 oil
 prices
 uh
 go
 down.
 So


this
 is
 u
 good
 for
 again
 the
 war
 on


inflation.
 If
 you
 remember
 in
 January
 of


2025,
 Trump
 actually
 openly
 said
 that


his
 plan
 to
 get
 inflation
 lower
 is
 to


get
 more
 oil
 and
 you
 have
 OPEC
 pump
 more


oil.
 You
 have
 oil
 prices
 down
 a
 lot
 and


now
 it
 looks
 like
 this
 is
 um
 this
 is


maybe
 another
 part
 of
 that.


You
 do
 have
 clear
 losers
 as
 well.
 Now,


of
 course,
 aside
 from
 President
 Moduro,


who
 is
 now,
 it
 seems,
 on
 a
 ship,
 uh,


you
 know,
 it
 seems
 like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a


chart
 where
 Venezuela
 was
 selling
 its


oil,
 a
 lot
 of
 was
 going
 to
 China.
 Now,


Venezuela
 was
 a
 staunch
 ally
 of
 China,


of
 Russia,
 and
 of
 Iran.
 And
 so
 now
 that


team
 is
 losing
 a
 big
 ally.
 Now,
 China
 is


still
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 oil
 from


Venezuela.
 Now,
 the
 president
 was
 very


clear
 that,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to


pump
 more
 oil
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 sell
 it


to
 everyone.
 So,
 China
 is
 still
 going
 to


get
 more
 oil,
 but
 they
 probably
 won't


get
 it
 at
 the
 same
 discounted
 price.


Venezuelan
 oil
 was
 sanctioned.
 It
 really


couldn't
 go
 to
 the
 global
 market.
 And


so,
 they
 had
 to
 sell
 it
 at
 a
 discount
 to


other
 people,
 similar
 to
 what
 Russia


does,
 right?
 Russia
 oil
 was
 sanctioned.


They
 sell
 it
 at
 a
 discount
 to
 other


countries.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 China
 was
 getting


discounted
 oil.
 Now,
 they're
 not
 getting


discounted
 oil
 anymore.
 China
 was


friends
 with
 Venezuela.
 In
 fact,
 reports


suggest
 that
 they
 had
 a
 Chinese


delegation
 being
 sent
 to
 Venezuela
 just


in
 a
 few
 hours
 before
 the
 operation.


Now,
 it
 looks
 like
 they've
 lost
 a
 key


ally
 in
 Latin
 America.


Um,
 this
 of
 course
 could
 also
 point
 to


trouble
 for
 uh
 allies
 of
 uh
 President


Maduro,
 say
 Cuba,
 for
 example,
 longtime


thorn
 in
 the
 side
 of
 the
 US.
 You
 know,


doesn't
 have
 any
 oil
 but
 uh
 not
 friends


with
 the
 US.
 And
 of
 course,
 um,


Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 is
 of


Cuban
 descent.
 And
 of
 course,
 uh,
 the


Cuban
 community
 in
 the
 US
 really
 doesn't


like
 what's
 happening
 in
 Cuba.
 And
 so
 I


think
 he
 should
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 worried.


If
 you
 are
 Iran,
 you
 could
 probably
 be


upset
 as
 well.
 You're
 losing
 another


ally.
 But
 it
 also
 tells
 you
 very
 clearly


that
 the
 president
 is
 a
 man
 of
 action.


He
 says
 many
 things,
 but
 he
 also
 has


done
 many
 things
 as
 well.
 um
 many
 things


other
 presidents
 would
 not
 have
 done


right
 directly
 strike
 Iran
 bombs
 huge


huge
 clampdown
 on
 illegal
 immigration


everywhere
 in
 the
 country
 of
 course


strikes
 on
 Venezuela
 but
 he's
 also
 said


other
 things
 that
 he
 hasn't
 done
 yet
 so


let's
 say
 that
 you
 are
 the
 prime


minister
 of
 Denmark
 who
 of
 course


controls
 Greenland
 president
 has
 said


that
 you
 know
 Greenland
 is
 very
 very


important
 to
 us
 from
 a
 national
 security


standpoint
 so
 does
 that
 increase
 the


probability
 that
 you
 know
 maybe
 one
 day


Greenland
 will
 have
 to
 change
 hands
 as


well.
 Of
 course,
 the
 president
 also
 made


comments
 about
 Canada
 and
 we
 we
 don't


know
 what
 will
 happen
 there.
 One
 thing


to
 note
 though
 is
 that
 strategically


speaking,
 the
 oil
 that
 Venezuela
 pumps


is
 heavy
 crude.
 That's
 the
 same
 stuff


that
 Canada
 pumps
 to
 as
 well.
 And
 right


now,
 Canada
 has
 one
 captain
 consumer,


the
 United
 States.
 And
 the
 United
 States


is
 relying
 upon
 Canadian
 heavy
 crude
 as


well.
 That's
 what
 the
 refiners
 are


optimized
 for.
 If
 you
 have
 another


source
 of
 heavy
 crude
 come
 online
 from


Venezuela,
 that
 really
 really
 decreases


the
 bargaining
 power
 that
 Canadian
 oil


companies
 have.
 And
 of
 course,
 that
 is
 a


big
 problem
 from
 a
 geostrategic


way
 for
 for
 Canada
 and
 maybe
 why
 Prime


Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 is
 eager
 to


greenlight
 another
 pipeline
 so
 that
 they


have
 other
 outlets
 for
 Canadian
 oil.


So,
 one
 other
 thing,
 of
 course,
 we
 have


to
 think
 about
 is
 that
 what
 other
 thing


has
 Trump
 um
 kind
 of
 obsessed
 about
 over


and
 over
 again,
 um
 that's
 lower
 interest


rates.
 And
 as
 I
 wrote
 last
 week,
 my


blog,
 the
 market
 is
 really
 not
 pricing


in
 that
 Trump
 will
 get
 his
 way.
 I
 the


market
 really
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 think


that,
 you
 know,
 prices
 interest
 rates


the
 same
 way
 they
 did
 months
 ago.
 So


they
 don't
 really
 place
 probability
 on


President
 Trump
 actually
 getting
 his
 way


and
 able
 to
 lower
 interest
 rates
 even


though
 the
 president
 has
 you
 know
 done
 a


lot
 of
 really
 obvious
 moves
 to
 try
 to
 do


that.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 continues
 to
 be
 a


significant
 mispricing
 of
 the
 market.
 So


uh
 president
 has
 a
 track
 record
 of
 uh


acting
 on
 things
 that
 he
 cares
 a
 lot


about.
 So
 markets
 will
 be
 exciting
 this


next
 week.
 Guessing
 that
 you
 know
 I


since
 it
 was
 so
 effortless.
 Maybe
 not


even
 that
 big
 of
 an
 impact,
 but
 you


know,
 if
 you
 have
 lower
 oil
 prices
 in


the
 future,
 maybe
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


downward
 pressure
 on
 inflation.


Okay,
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about,
 of
 course,
 is
 silver.
 Now,


last
 week
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 silver
 was


absolutely
 surging,
 was
 up
 10%
 a
 week.


Last
 Friday,
 when
 you
 do
 something
 like


that,
 it
 looks
 like
 an
 obvious
 obvious


blowoff
 top.
 And
 earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 we


did
 see
 silver
 totally,
 totally
 implode.


Now,
 there
 are
 two
 concrete
 drivers
 of


this.
 One
 of
 course
 uh
 is
 that
 well


actually
 one
 concrete
 driver
 of
 this
 and


another
 thing
 we'll
 talk
 about
 and
 that


is
 of
 course
 higher
 margins
 from
 the


CME.
 So
 professional
 speculators
 in


silver
 usually
 trade
 through
 futures
 and


when
 you
 trade
 through
 silver
 futures


you're
 operating
 on
 an
 regulated


exchange.
 Your
 counterparty
 is
 the


exchange.
 So
 a
 standard
 future
 futures


contract
 for
 silver
 gives
 you
 control


over
 5,000
 ounces
 of
 silver.
 So
 that's,


you
 know,
 about
 30
 uh
 $350,000
 worth
 of


silver.


Now,
 in
 order
 to
 have
 control
 over
 a


silver
 contract,
 you
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a


little
 bit
 of
 margin
 with
 the
 w
 with
 the


exchange.
 The
 reason
 for
 this
 is
 that


the
 exchange
 wants
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you


have
 money
 uh
 to
 pay
 in
 case
 the


contract
 goes
 against
 you.
 So
 let's
 say


that
 you
 bought
 one
 silver
 contract
 and


then
 suddenly
 the
 price
 declines.
 How


does
 the
 exchange
 know
 that
 you
 are
 able


to
 uh
 um
 you
 you
 are
 able
 to
 pay
 the


exchange
 uh
 in
 the
 case
 in
 case
 that
 uh


you
 know
 you
 continue
 to
 lose
 money
 or


you're
 underwater
 in
 your
 contract.
 So


the
 exchange
 collects
 a
 little
 bit
 of


margin
 uh
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh
 you


don't
 default.
 Now
 the
 amount
 of
 margin


the
 exchange
 has
 to
 connect
 collect
 is


in
 proportion
 uh
 to
 the
 size
 of
 the


market
 value
 of
 the
 contract
 and
 also
 to


the
 volatility
 of
 the
 contract.
 as


silver
 prices
 went
 from
 say50
 to
 $75
 in


a
 very
 volatile
 way.
 You
 know
 there
 you


need
 to
 put
 down
 more
 margin
 uh
 because


from
 an
 exchange
 standpoint
 there's
 a


higher
 probability
 that
 you
 could
 have


big
 big
 volatile
 moves
 suddenly
 leaving


the
 exchange
 exposed
 to
 counterparty


risk.
 That
 is
 to
 say
 you
 could
 default


if
 silver
 were
 to
 suddenly
 implode.


So
 exchange
 very
 naturally
 raises


margins
 and
 what
 that
 means
 that
 you


have
 to
 put
 up
 more
 money
 to
 be
 able
 to


have
 control
 over
 a
 silver
 contract.
 Now


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 margin
 hikes
 it
 looks


like
 it
 went
 from
 you
 know
 20ome,000
 to


30
 some
 thousand.
 Uh
 when
 you
 raise
 the


margin
 some
 people
 say
 you're
 a
 DGEN
 who


has
 been
 levered
 up
 uh
 with
 silver


futures
 will
 have
 to
 put
 up
 more
 money


to
 be
 able
 to
 maintain
 their
 position.


Sometimes
 they
 don't
 have
 that
 much


money
 and
 so
 when
 that
 happens
 they
 get


liquidated
 and
 when
 they
 get
 liquidated


you
 know
 the
 price
 of
 the
 contract
 goes


down
 maybe
 that
 also
 compels
 other


people
 to
 get
 liquidated
 as
 well.
 So


ultimately
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 mechanical


thing
 where
 you
 have
 u
 basically
 a


liquidity
 squeeze
 where
 the
 really


really
 big
 dens
 are
 squeezed
 out
 and


this
 happens
 a
 lot
 if
 you
 look
 at
 any


type
 of
 um
 speculation
 in
 the
 1980s
 when


you
 have
 the
 Hunts
 brothers
 squeezing


silver
 to
 dizzying
 heights
 the
 exchanges


also
 continue
 to
 raise
 their
 margin


again
 this
 is
 not
 necessarily
 some
 sort


of
 conspiracy
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 it's


just
 totally
 mechanical
 the
 exchange
 you


is
 dealing
 with
 a
 more
 volatile


commodity.
 It's
 trying
 to
 protect
 itself


from
 defaults
 and
 so
 it
 obviously
 has
 to


raise
 margins.
 There's
 nothing
 uh


nefarious
 about
 it.
 Sometimes
 there
 is


back
 in
 the
 1980s
 uh
 they
 try
 to
 um
 they


changed
 the
 rules
 so
 that
 you
 can
 not


buy
 silver,
 you
 could
 only
 sell.
 And
 so


of
 course
 that's
 putting
 that
 put
 a
 lot


of
 downward
 pressure
 on
 silver
 prices


and
 did
 ultimately
 precipitate
 a
 huge


implosion.
 They're
 not
 doing
 that
 today.


So
 far
 by
 all
 accounts
 it's
 just
 normal


functioning
 of
 how
 an
 exchange
 works.


And
 obviously
 when
 you
 have
 an
 exchange


hiking
 margins
 that's
 going
 to
 put


downward
 pressure
 on
 the
 prices.
 How


much
 is
 going
 to
 depend
 on
 how
 levered


it
 was.
 And
 obviously
 if
 you're
 going
 up


10%
 a
 day
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage.
 And


so
 you
 also
 imploded
 10%
 a
 day.


The
 second
 big
 news
 came
 out
 of
 China


and
 that
 China
 is
 going
 to
 more
 exercise


more
 control
 over
 how
 it
 exports
 silver.


Now,
 China
 has
 already
 been
 doing
 this


with
 all
 sorts
 of
 commodities.
 Remember,


they
 have
 their,
 you
 know,
 control
 over


rare
 earth
 and
 so
 forth.
 Now,
 it
 seems


like
 they're
 extending
 this
 export


control
 regime
 to
 silver.
 I
 don't
 think


this
 should
 be
 a
 surprise,
 because
 China


is
 the
 largest
 manufacturing
 power
 in


the
 world.
 and
 silver,
 it's
 not
 just
 for


speculation,
 it's
 also
 a
 key
 industrial


input.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 all
 these


speculators
 in
 the
 west
 kind
 of
 making


silver
 prices
 really
 high,
 that
 has
 a


real
 impact
 on
 the
 Chinese
 economy,


Chinese
 businesses
 and
 so
 forth,
 it


makes
 uh
 it
 makes
 basically
 things
 like


solar
 panels
 more
 expensive.
 And
 so
 if


there
 is
 a
 potential
 shortage
 or
 some


kind
 of
 weird
 speculation,
 of
 course,


the
 Chinese
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more


careful
 since
 this
 is
 um
 maybe
 even
 a


national
 security
 issue.
 Now,
 China
 is


the
 second
 largest
 uh
 minor
 of
 silver,


the
 largest
 is
 Mexico.
 So
 when
 they
 put


on
 these
 expert
 controls
 on
 silver,
 so


what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 in
 order
 to
 sell


expert
 silver,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


have
 a
 license
 from
 the
 Chinese


authorities.
 They're
 going
 to
 have
 more


control
 over
 this.
 What
 that
 means
 is


very
 clearly
 that
 outside
 of
 China
 maybe


the
 supply
 of
 silver
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 less
 uh
 because
 the
 Chinese


export
 of
 silver
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more


controlled.
 Now
 the
 immediate
 impact
 of


this
 should
 be
 to
 have
 a
 wedge
 in
 silver


prices
 where
 Chinese
 silver
 prices
 are


going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 lower
 and


global
 price
 of
 silver
 a
 little
 bit


higher
 since
 you
 have
 less
 Chinese


supply.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 a
 bullish


development
 for
 silver
 prices
 but
 was


not
 able
 to
 overcome
 of
 course
 the
 uh


implosion
 you
 had
 from
 higher
 margin


rates.
 Now
 there
 is
 always
 a
 question


whether
 or
 not
 the
 US
 or
 maybe
 other


countries
 will
 also
 declare
 silver
 to
 be


uh
 you
 know
 commodity
 of
 national


importance
 and
 then
 also
 put
 on
 their


own
 bears.
 So
 that's
 something
 to
 watch


out
 as
 well.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 silver


prices,
 they
 classically
 follow
 this


formation
 where
 they
 kind
 of
 surge
 to
 uh


comically
 high
 levels
 and
 then
 just


implode.
 There
 is
 a
 possibility
 that


this
 is
 what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 We


could
 just
 totally
 implode.
 Uh
 but
 my


gut
 says
 that,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 hate


saying
 this,
 that
 maybe
 there's


something
 about
 different
 this
 time.
 And


so
 I
 I
 personally
 think
 that
 the
 highs


for
 silver
 are
 not
 yet
 in
 for
 the
 year.


Although
 when
 you
 have
 all
 this


technical
 damage,
 you
 do
 usually
 need
 to


digest
 a
 while.
 Not
 necessarily
 a
 long


time.
 Remember
 when
 gold
 had
 that
 big


blowoff
 blowoff,
 it
 came
 down
 a
 little


bit,
 steadied,
 steadied,
 and
 then
 just


recently
 made
 new
 all-time
 highs.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 all
 I
 prepared
 for


today.
 Again,
 this
 is
 just
 year
 one
 in


the
 Trump
 administration.
 We
 have
 three


more
 years.
 Maybe
 the
 map,
 the
 global


map
 in
 a
 few
 years
 will
 be
 different


than
 the
 one
 today.
 All
 right,
 talk
 to


you
 guys
 next
 week.

### 全球地缘政治格局与经济联动

除了委内瑞拉的重大事件，本周全球其他地缘政治热点也涌现出重要动态。在远东地区，中国围绕台湾举行了大规模军事演习，其潜在的封锁能力对台湾经济构成了严峻挑战。日本首相此前对台湾的支持言论激怒了中国，尽管有报道称美国总统特朗普曾建议日方缓和立场，但日本仍坚持对台支持。这一系列事件反映了美国国家安全战略中关于多极世界和势力范围的设想，即美国将主导北美和拉丁美洲，而中国可能在远东地区拥有其势力范围。

在东欧，俄罗斯指责乌克兰策划了针对总统普京的暗杀行动，尽管美国调查认为并非如此，但这一事件无疑加剧了俄乌冲突的紧张局势，并可能为俄罗斯进一步军事升级提供借口。中东地区，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡与特朗普的会晤预示着可能针对伊朗采取军事行动，尽管目标已从阻止核武器转向限制其弹道导弹能力。这些地缘政治的动荡与全球经济紧密相连，尤其是在通胀压力持续的背景下，任何区域冲突的升级都可能对能源供应和全球供应链造成冲击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So
 I
 think
 there
 are
 four
 theaters
 in


the
 world
 and
 in
 each
 geopolitical


theater
 we
 had
 some
 pretty
 big


developments
 from
 the
 far
 east
 to
 Latin


America
 to
 Europe
 to
 the
 Middle
 East.


Starting
 with
 the
 Far
 East.
 So
 earlier


in
 the
 week,
 last
 week,
 we
 had
 China


make
 pretty
 big
 military
 exercises
 all


around
 Taiwan.
 And
 what
 they
 seem
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 projecting
 is
 that


they
 could
 easily
 blockade
 Taiwan.
 And


if
 they
 were
 to
 blockade
 Taiwan,
 again,


Taiwan
 is
 an
 island,
 so
 it's
 not


self-sufficient
 in
 many
 things
 like
 oil.


Uh
 the
 ch
 the
 Taiwanese
 economy
 would


easily
 crumble
 and
 um
 it
 would
 be
 the


end
 of
 that
 pretty
 quickly.
 Now
 the


broader
 context
 of
 course
 is
 that
 not


too
 long
 ago
 you
 had
 Prime
 Minister


Tekachi
 of
 Japan
 make
 supportive


statements
 for
 Taiwan
 that
 really


angered
 the
 Chinese
 and
 you
 know


President
 Trump
 actually
 seemed
 to


reportedly
 intervene
 to
 maybe
 just


politely
 suggest
 the
 Japanese
 prime


minister
 to
 maybe
 moderate
 her
 stance
 a


little
 bit.
 Although
 by
 all
 reports
 uh


Japan
 still
 stands
 in
 support
 of
 Taiwan


in
 case
 of
 potential
 military
 conflict.


For
 context
 here,
 uh
 Taiwan
 was
 once
 a


Japanese
 colony.
 Many
 people
 in
 Taiwan


remember
 that
 period
 positively
 and
 look


upon
 Japan
 in
 a
 very
 positive
 light.
 But


of
 course,
 if
 you
 recall
 from
 the
 United


States's
 most
 recent
 national
 security


strategy,
 the
 US
 is
 basically
 viewing


the
 world
 as
 multipolar
 where
 every


country
 has
 your
 sphere
 of
 influence.


Very
 clearly
 the
 United
 States
 will
 have


a
 Trump
 correlary
 to
 the
 Monroal


doctrine.
 Latin
 America,
 North
 America


will
 be
 under
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 implication
 of


course
 is
 that
 the
 Far
 East,
 at least


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Taiwan,
 will
 be
 under


China
 and
 maybe
 Russia
 will
 have


Ukraine.


Now,
 moving
 on
 to
 Eastern
 Europe.


Earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 uh
 Russia
 loudly


complained
 that
 uh
 Ukraine
 will
 actually


launched
 a
 very
 mass-cale
 assassination


attempt
 on
 President
 Putin.
 Apparently,


there
 was
 a
 large
 fleet
 of
 Ukrainian


drones
 launched
 and
 Russia
 alleges
 that


these
 drones
 were
 targeted
 towards
 where


where
 President
 Putin
 was
 and
 it
 was
 an


assassination
 account.
 Putin
 actually


complained
 to
 Trump
 which
 then


complained
 to
 President
 Zalinski.
 Now,


the
 US
 it
 seems
 that
 reports
 suggest


have
 determined
 that
 this
 actually
 was


not
 an
 assassination
 attempt
 that
 maybe


they
 were
 targeting
 other
 military


installations
 in
 in
 Russia.
 But
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 Russia
 is
 claiming


this
 and
 perceiving
 this,
 then
 again,


that
 is
 an
 escalation
 in
 the
 Russia


Ukraine
 war
 and
 suggests
 that
 peace


talks
 are
 not
 going
 well
 and
 maybe
 it


could
 serve
 as
 a
 pretext
 for
 further


military
 escalation
 by
 the
 Russians.


Moving
 on
 to
 the
 Middle
 East,
 also


another
 very
 interesting
 development.


Now,
 you
 had
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 of
 Israel
 basically
 just,
 you


know,
 fly
 down
 to
 Mara
 Lago,
 hang
 out


with
 the
 president
 the
 fifth
 time.
 He's


done
 this
 this
 year.
 That's
 kind
 of
 a


record.
 And
 what
 usually
 happens,
 of


course,
 is
 that
 after
 these
 discussions,


you
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 geopolitical


escalation.


Now,
 it's
 no
 secret
 what
 Prime
 Minister


Netanyahu
 would
 like
 is
 to
 have
 more


military
 action
 on
 Iran,
 but
 of
 course,


they
 can't
 do
 that
 without
 the
 support


of
 the
 United
 States.
 Last
 time
 they


attacked
 Iran,
 Iran
 retaliated
 with


missiles
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 missiles


were
 intercepted
 by
 US
 um
 US
 support.


And
 so
 they
 really
 need
 the
 US
 to


protect
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 attack
 Iran.


Now
 reporting
 suggests
 that
 right
 now


what
 u
 Netanyahu
 is
 saying
 is
 that
 you


know
 Iran
 they
 have
 these
 ballistic


missiles.
 They
 can
 attack
 Israel.
 They


are
 a
 threat
 to
 us.
 We
 got
 to
 go
 and


take
 out
 that
 capability.
 Now
 notice
 now


that
 the
 goalposts
 are
 moving.
 initially


was
 that
 Iran
 could
 never
 have
 nuclear


weapons
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 take
 that
 out


and
 you
 know
 President
 Trump
 went
 and


bombed
 the
 nuclear
 facilities
 in
 Iran.


Now
 the
 standard
 is
 being
 lowered.
 It's


not
 that
 Iran
 can
 have
 nuclear
 weapons


is
 that
 they
 can't
 have
 ballistic


missiles
 and
 if
 uh
 the
 president
 agrees


with
 that
 lower
 standard
 then
 yes
 that


he's
 greenlighting
 more
 military
 attacks


in
 the
 Middle
 East.

### 白银市场动荡：保证金飙升与中国出口管制

本周，白银市场经历了剧烈的价格波动，从早些时候的飙升转为大幅下跌。这一“崩盘”现象主要由两个因素驱动。首先是芝加哥商品交易所（CME）提高了白银期货合约的保证金要求。当白银价格剧烈波动时，交易所会提高保证金以规避交易者违约风险。此次保证金的显著提升，迫使大量高杠杆的投机者追加资金或被强制平仓，从而引发了连锁反应，导致价格加速下跌，这是一种典型的市场流动性挤压（liquidity squeeze）现象。

其次，中国宣布将加强对白银出口的管控。作为全球最大的制造国，中国视白银为重要的工业投入品，而非仅仅是投机工具。西方投机者推高白银价格，会直接影响到中国太阳能电池板等产品的生产成本。因此，中国收紧出口管制，要求出口商获得许可，旨在更有效地控制白银供应，这可能导致中国以外的白银供应减少，并推高全球白银价格。尽管这一因素对白银价格构成利好，但其影响被CME保证金提高所带来的技术性抛售所掩盖。

尽管近期白银价格出现技术性损伤，但演讲者认为，从长远来看，白银的上涨趋势尚未结束，其高点可能尚未到来，这与黄金近期创下历史新高的情况有相似之处。然而，市场对特朗普政府降低利率的预期似乎存在显著的误判，这可能导致未来市场出现波动。

So
 we
 got
 to
 talk
 about
 uh
 what
 happened


and
 what
 it
 all
 means
 for
 the
 economy


and
 for
 markets.
 And
 also
 we
 have
 to


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 silver
 as
 well.


So
 silver
 totally
 imploded
 uh
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 week.
 There
 are
 some


concrete
 causes
 for
 that
 although
 it
 did


recover
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 So
 first


though
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 happened
 in


the
 world
 of
 geopolitics.


Okay,
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about,
 of
 course,
 is
 silver.
 Now,


last
 week
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 silver
 was


absolutely
 surging,
 was
 up
 10%
 a
 week.


Last
 Friday,
 when
 you
 do
 something
 like


that,
 it
 looks
 like
 an
 obvious
 obvious


blowoff
 top.
 And
 earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 we


did
 see
 silver
 totally,
 totally
 implode.


Now,
 there
 are
 two
 concrete
 drivers
 of


this.
 One
 of
 course
 uh
 is
 that
 well


actually
 one
 concrete
 driver
 of
 this
 and


another
 thing
 we'll
 talk
 about
 and
 that


is
 of
 course
 higher
 margins
 from
 the


CME.
 So
 professional
 speculators
 in


silver
 usually
 trade
 through
 futures
 and


when
 you
 trade
 through
 silver
 futures


you're
 operating
 on
 an
 regulated


exchange.
 Your
 counterparty
 is
 the


exchange.
 So
 a
 standard
 future
 futures


contract
 for
 silver
 gives
 you
 control


over
 5,000
 ounces
 of
 silver.
 So
 that's,


you
 know,
 about
 30
 uh
 $350,000
 worth
 of


silver.


Now,
 in
 order
 to
 have
 control
 over
 a


silver
 contract,
 you
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a


little
 bit
 of
 margin
 with
 the
 w
 with
 the


exchange.
 The
 reason
 for
 this
 is
 that


the
 exchange
 wants
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you


have
 money
 uh
 to
 pay
 in
 case
 the


contract
 goes
 against
 you.
 So
 let's
 say


that
 you
 bought
 one
 silver
 contract
 and


then
 suddenly
 the
 price
 declines.
 How


does
 the
 exchange
 know
 that
 you
 are
 able


to
 uh
 um
 you
 you
 are
 able
 to
 pay
 the


exchange
 uh
 in
 the
 case
 in
 case
 that
 uh


you
 know
 you
 continue
 to
 lose
 money
 or


you're
 underwater
 in
 your
 contract.
 So


the
 exchange
 collects
 a
 little
 bit
 of


margin
 uh
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh
 you


don't
 default.
 Now
 the
 amount
 of
 margin


the
 exchange
 has
 to
 connect
 collect
 is


in
 proportion
 uh
 to
 the
 size
 of
 the


market
 value
 of
 the
 contract
 and
 also
 to


the
 volatility
 of
 the
 contract.
 as


silver
 prices
 went
 from
 say50
 to
 $75
 in


a
 very
 volatile
 way.
 You
 know
 there
 you


need
 to
 put
 down
 more
 margin
 uh
 because


from
 an
 exchange
 standpoint
 there's
 a


higher
 probability
 that
 you
 could
 have


big
 big
 volatile
 moves
 suddenly
 leaving


the
 exchange
 exposed
 to
 counterparty


risk.
 That
 is
 to
 say
 you
 could
 default


if
 silver
 were
 to
 suddenly
 implode.


So
 exchange
 very
 naturally
 raises


margins
 and
 what
 that
 means
 that
 you


have
 to
 put
 up
 more
 money
 to
 be
 able
 to


have
 control
 over
 a
 silver
 contract.
 Now


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 margin
 hikes
 it
 looks


like
 it
 went
 from
 you
 know
 20ome,000
 to


30
 some
 thousand.
 Uh
 when
 you
 raise
 the


margin
 some
 people
 say
 you're
 a
 DGEN
 who


has
 been
 levered
 up
 uh
 with
 silver


futures
 will
 have
 to
 put
 up
 more
 money


to
 be
 able
 to
 maintain
 their
 position.


Sometimes
 they
 don't
 have
 that
 much


money
 and
 so
 when
 that
 happens
 they
 get


liquidated
 and
 when
 they
 get
 liquidated


you
 know
 the
 price
 of
 the
 contract
 goes


down
 maybe
 that
 also
 compels
 other


people
 to
 get
 liquidated
 as
 well.
 So


ultimately
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 mechanical


thing
 where
 you
 have
 u
 basically
 a


liquidity
 squeeze
 where
 the
 really


really
 big
 dens
 are
 squeezed
 out
 and


this
 happens
 a
 lot
 if
 you
 look
 at
 any


type
 of
 um
 speculation
 in
 the
 1980s
 when


you
 have
 the
 Hunts
 brothers
 squeezing


silver
 to
 dizzying
 heights
 the
 exchanges


also
 continue
 to
 raise
 their
 margin


again
 this
 is
 not
 necessarily
 some
 sort


of
 conspiracy
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 it's


just
 totally
 mechanical
 the
 exchange
 you


is
 dealing
 with
 a
 more
 volatile


commodity.
 It's
 trying
 to
 protect
 itself


from
 defaults
 and
 so
 it
 obviously
 has
 to


raise
 margins.
 There's
 nothing
 uh


nefarious
 about
 it.
 Sometimes
 there
 is


back
 in
 the
 1980s
 uh
 they
 try
 to
 um
 they


changed
 the
 rules
 so
 that
 you
 can
 not


buy
 silver,
 you
 could
 only
 sell.
 And
 so


of
 course
 that's
 putting
 that
 put
 a
 lot


of
 downward
 pressure
 on
 silver
 prices


and
 did
 ultimately
 precipitate
 a
 huge


implosion.
 They're
 not
 doing
 that
 today.


So
 far
 by
 all
 accounts
 it's
 just
 normal


functioning
 of
 how
 an
 exchange
 works.


And
 obviously
 when
 you
 have
 an
 exchange


hiking
 margins
 that's
 going
 to
 put


downward
 pressure
 on
 the
 prices.
 How


much
 is
 going
 to
 depend
 on
 how
 levered


it
 was.
 And
 obviously
 if
 you're
 going
 up


10%
 a
 day
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage.
 And


so
 you
 also
 imploded
 10%
 a
 day.


The
 second
 big
 news
 came
 out
 of
 China


and
 that
 China
 is
 going
 to
 more
 exercise


more
 control
 over
 how
 it
 exports
 silver.


Now,
 China
 has
 already
 been
 doing
 this


with
 all
 sorts
 of
 commodities.
 Remember,


they
 have
 their,
 you
 know,
 control
 over


rare
 earth
 and
 so
 forth.
 Now,
 it
 seems


like
 they're
 extending
 this
 export


control
 regime
 to
 silver.
 I
 don't
 think


this
 should
 be
 a
 surprise,
 because
 China


is
 the
 largest
 manufacturing
 power
 in


the
 world.
 and
 silver,
 it's
 not
 just
 for


speculation,
 it's
 also
 a
 key
 industrial


input.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 all
 these


speculators
 in
 the
 west
 kind
 of
 making


silver
 prices
 really
 high,
 that
 has
 a


real
 impact
 on
 the
 Chinese
 economy,


Chinese
 businesses
 and
 so
 forth,
 it


makes
 uh
 it
 makes
 basically
 things
 like


solar
 panels
 more
 expensive.
 And
 so
 if


there
 is
 a
 potential
 shortage
 or
 some


kind
 of
 weird
 speculation,
 of
 course,


the
 Chinese
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more


careful
 since
 this
 is
 um
 maybe
 even
 a


national
 security
 issue.
 Now,
 China
 is


the
 second
 largest
 uh
 minor
 of
 silver,


the
 largest
 is
 Mexico.
 So
 when
 they
 put


on
 these
 expert
 controls
 on
 silver,
 so


what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 in
 order
 to
 sell


expert
 silver,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


have
 a
 license
 from
 the
 Chinese


authorities.
 They're
 going
 to
 have
 more


control
 over
 this.
 What
 that
 means
 is


very
 clearly
 that
 outside
 of
 China
 maybe


the
 supply
 of
 silver
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 less
 uh
 because
 the
 Chinese


export
 of
 silver
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more


controlled.
 Now
 the
 immediate
 impact
 of


this
 should
 be
 to
 have
 a
 wedge
 in
 silver


prices
 where
 Chinese
 silver
 prices
 are


going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 lower
 and


global
 price
 of
 silver
 a
 little
 bit


higher
 since
 you
 have
 less
 Chinese


supply.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 a
 bullish


development
 for
 silver
 prices
 but
 was


not
 able
 to
 overcome
 of
 course
 the
 uh


implosion
 you
 had
 from
 higher
 margin


rates.
 Now
 there
 is
 always
 a
 question


whether
 or
 not
 the
 US
 or
 maybe
 other


countries
 will
 also
 declare
 silver
 to
 be


uh
 you
 know
 commodity
 of
 national


importance
 and
 then
 also
 put
 on
 their


own
 bears.
 So
 that's
 something
 to
 watch


out
 as
 well.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 silver


prices,
 they
 classically
 follow
 this


formation
 where
 they
 kind
 of
 surge
 to
 uh


comically
 high
 levels
 and
 then
 just


implode.
 There
 is
 a
 possibility
 that


this
 is
 what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 We


could
 just
 totally
 implode.
 Uh
 but
 my


gut
 says
 that,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 hate


saying
 this,
 that
 maybe
 there's


something
 about
 different
 this
 time.
 And


so
 I
 I
 personally
 think
 that
 the
 highs


for
 silver
 are
 not
 yet
 in
 for
 the
 year.


Although
 when
 you
 have
 all
 this


technical
 damage,
 you
 do
 usually
 need
 to


digest
 a
 while.
 Not
 necessarily
 a
 long


time.
 Remember
 when
 gold
 had
 that
 big


blowoff
 blowoff,
 it
 came
 down
 a
 little


bit,
 steadied,
 steadied,
 and
 then
 just


recently
 made
 new
 all-time
 highs.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 all
 I
 prepared
 for


today.
 Again,
 this
 is
 just
 year
 one
 in


the
 Trump
 administration.
 We
 have
 three


more
 years.
 Maybe
 the
 map,
 the
 global


map
 in
 a
 few
 years
 will
 be
 different


than
 the
 one
 today.
 All
 right,
 talk
 to


you
 guys
 next
 week.

### 经济政策焦点与市场预期

特朗普政府一直以来都高度关注降低利率，并将其视为刺激经济和对抗通胀的关键手段。然而，市场似乎并未充分定价特朗普实现其利率目标的可能性，对未来利率走势的预期与总统的意愿存在显著差异。这种市场定价的偏差可能预示着未来市场将出现波动。

此外，特朗普政府将“对抗通胀”视为核心任务之一。通过增加石油供应，特别是利用委内瑞拉丰富的石油资源，被认为是降低油价、进而抑制通胀的重要策略。虽然短期内油价不会立即大幅下降，但从长远来看，增加全球石油供应有望为抑制通胀提供动力。这些经济政策的走向，将是未来市场关注的焦点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Now
 the
 Trump
 administration
 told
 the
 entire


world
 that
 Latin
 America
 belongs
 to
 us.


So,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 call
 the
 shots
 here.


Now,
 earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 uh
 the


president
 surprised
 the
 world
 by


revealing
 that
 the
 CIA
 actually
 carried


covert
 operations
 on
 Venezuelan
 soil.


Now,
 everyone
 knew
 that
 the
 US
 had
 a


Navy
 presence
 right
 outside
 of


Venezuela,
 that
 they
 had
 been
 blowing
 up


Venezuelan
 boats,
 but
 until
 earlier
 in


the
 week,
 they
 had
 not
 uh
 done
 anything


on
 Venezuelan
 soil.
 So,
 that
 was
 a
 very


clear
 escalation.
 A
 CIA
 bombing


facilities
 in
 Venezuelan
 ports.


This
 morning,
 it
 was
 revealed
 that


around
 2:00
 a.m.,
 US
 forces
 basically


flew
 in
 uh
 to
 where
 President
 Maduro
 of


Venezuela
 was
 staying.
 uh
 basically


kidnapped
 him
 and
 his
 wife,
 put
 him
 on
 a


ship,
 the
 USS
 Euima,
 and
 that
 ship
 is


now
 on
 route
 to
 New
 York
 where
 uh


President
 Madura
 will
 face
 the
 US


courts.
 Now,
 throughout
 this
 operation,


uh
 it
 was
 it
 was
 only
 a
 few
 hours.
 There


were
 reportedly
 zero
 US
 casualties.
 One


US
 helicopter
 was
 hit,
 but
 that
 US


copter
 continued
 to
 fly
 when
 it's
 able


to
 return
 uh
 to
 to
 its
 uh
 to
 the
 ships.


So
 this
 was
 an
 amazing
 amazingly
 precise


attack
 and
 amazingly
 successful.


Now
 by
 orchestrating
 this
 it
 all
 by


guarantees
 that
 the
 Maduro
 regime
 has


collapsed
 and
 that
 there
 will
 be
 regime


change
 in
 Venezuela.


So,
 uh,
 this
 is
 definitely
 not
 in
 line


with
 the
 America
 first
 ethos
 that


President
 Trump
 often
 campaigned
 on


where
 the
 US
 would
 not,
 um,
 you
 know,


intervene
 in
 foreign
 wars,
 nation


building
 and
 all
 that.
 But
 it
 does
 fall


under
 the
 Trump
 coralary
 of
 having
 more


power
 over
 the
 Latin
 America.
 Now,
 why


does
 Trump
 doing
 this?
 I
 think
 some
 some


context
 is
 helpful
 here.
 So,
 Venezuela,


if
 you
 look
 on
 a
 map,
 is
 actually
 a


pretty
 large
 country.
 uh
 it's
 in
 uh


South
 America.
 It's
 the
 land
 mass
 is


about
 say
 20
 30%
 larger
 than
 Texas
 and


has
 a
 population
 of
 about
 30
 million


about
 the
 same
 population
 as
 the
 state


of
 Texas.
 Venezuela
 of
 course
 is
 most


known
 for
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 oil.
 According


to
 studies
 it
 has
 the
 most
 uh
 the


largest
 oil
 reproven
 oil
 reserves
 in
 the


entire
 world.
 So
 it
 has
 the
 potential
 to


be
 an
 oil
 superpower.
 However,
 if
 you


look
 at
 its
 output
 data
 over
 the
 past


decade,
 you'll
 notice
 that
 Venezuela
 is


actually
 outputting
 much
 less
 oil
 today


than
 it
 did
 a
 decade
 ago.
 So,
 that


decline
 in
 oil
 output
 largely
 has
 to
 do


with
 just
 the
 tremendous
 tremendous


mismanagement
 of
 the
 Venezuelan
 economy.


If
 you
 look
 at
 a
 chart
 of
 Venezuelan


GDP,
 you
 know,
 a
 decade
 ago,
 things
 were


actually
 going
 really
 well.
 Now,
 oil


prices
 were
 going
 up.
 uh
 Venezuela
 was


pumping
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 and
 the
 country
 the


people
 were
 getting
 much
 wealthier.
 Now


that
 all
 ran
 into
 problems
 when
 the
 oil


price
 of
 oil
 collapsed
 and
 then
 you
 had


new
 change
 in
 regime
 a
 more
 left-wing


regime
 came
 to
 power
 in
 Caracus
 and
 they


did
 not
 do
 a
 very
 good
 job
 and
 what
 you


see
 is
 the
 complete
 implosion
 of
 the


Venezuelan
 economy.
 According
 to
 the


United
 Nations,
 about
 20%
 of
 Venezuelans


actually
 fled
 the
 country.
 Now,
 that's


like
 7
 million
 people.
 Uh,
 viral
 videos


at
 the
 time
 would
 show
 that
 many


Venezuelans
 were
 basically
 starving.
 You


can
 see
 them
 throwing
 rocks
 at
 cows,


trying
 to
 kill
 the
 cow
 to
 eat
 them.
 It


was
 very
 much
 a
 humanitarian
 disaster.


Now,
 you
 had
 Venezuelan
 refugees
 flood


the
 entire
 world.
 You
 have
 Venezuelan


refugees
 in
 Chile,
 um,
 in
 Colombia,


Mexico,
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Uh
 this
 was
 a
 tremendous


tremendous
 catastrophe.
 You
 had
 a


country
 that
 was
 doing
 on
 the
 upswing


just
 just
 totally
 destroyed
 and
 of


course
 the
 people
 Venezuelans
 did
 not


like
 that
 and
 ideally
 there
 would
 be
 a


mechanism
 for
 the
 people
 to
 change


course
 to
 have
 a
 new
 government.
 Of


course
 that
 was
 naturally
 through
 the


ballot
 box.
 Now
 Venezuela
 did
 recently
 a


few
 years
 ago
 have
 an
 election
 by
 all


accounts.
 President
 Maduro
 lost
 that


election
 in
 a
 big
 way
 for
 obvious


reasons.
 Um
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 he
 just


decided
 that
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 leave
 and


so
 basically
 became
 a
 de
 facto
 dictator


of
 Venezuela.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 who
 did
 a


terrible
 job
 ruined
 the
 lives
 of


millions
 of
 people
 ruined
 his
 country


and
 it's
 just
 not
 very
 popular.
 However


though
 and
 of
 course
 he's
 uh
 not
 friends


with
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 friends


with
 Russia,
 Iran
 and
 China.
 basically


friends
 with
 people
 who
 are
 not
 uh
 with


team
 Trump,
 team
 USA.


So
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 motivation
 for
 this


uh
 move
 is
 twofold.
 One
 of
 course
 is
 to


strengthen
 US
 influence
 in
 uh
 Latin


America


and
 secondly
 of
 course
 is
 for
 oil.
 Now,


in
 his
 uh
 in
 his
 press
 conference
 after


his
 president
 is
 is
 totally
 blunt.
 You


know,
 it's
 it's
 not
 like
 President
 Bush


going
 into
 Iraq
 and
 then
 not
 so
 much


telling
 you
 about
 the
 oil,
 although
 a


lot
 of
 US
 companies
 having
 big
 oil


contracts.
 It's
 that
 the
 US
 president
 is


telling
 you
 today,
 President
 Trump
 is


telling
 you
 today
 that
 Venezuela
 has


lots
 of
 oil
 and
 the
 US
 is
 going
 to
 have


control
 over
 it
 and
 it's
 this
 uh


operation
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 not
 going
 to


cost
 taxpayer
 money
 because
 uh
 the
 US
 is


going
 to
 get
 paid
 through
 oil.
 So,
 it's


very
 open
 about
 it.
 The
 US
 would
 like
 to


have
 more
 control
 over
 Venezuelan


resources.
 Now,
 a
 coup
 attempt
 has


always
 been
 telegraphed.
 Again,
 you
 had


that
 military
 flotillaa
 outside
 of


Venezuela.
 You
 also
 had
 the
 US


intelligence
 operations
 smuggle
 out


Venezuelan
 opposition
 leader
 Machado


smuggled
 her
 out
 into
 um
 to
 Sweden
 where


she
 could
 get
 her,
 you
 know,
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize,
 have
 more
 international


legitimacy.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 US
 has


basically
 changed
 its
 mind
 on
 that.
 She


was,
 you
 know,
 probably
 a
 plan
 B
 or
 plan


A
 or
 plan
 C
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 But


maybe
 looking
 at
 how
 successful
 the


operation
 was
 today,
 the
 president
 very


openly
 told
 everyone
 that
 actually
 the


US
 will
 run
 Venezuela.


>> We
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 involved
 with
 uh


having
 somebody
 else
 get
 in
 and
 we
 have


the
 same
 situation
 that
 we
 had
 for
 the


last
 long
 period
 of
 years.
 So
 we
 are


going
 to
 run
 the
 country
 until
 such
 time


as
 we
 can
 do
 a
 safe,
 proper
 and


judicious


transition.
 Eventually,


Trump
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 will
 give


Venezuelan
 back,
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 this


could
 be
 years
 or
 decades,
 and
 no
 one


knows
 when.


So,
 it
 looks
 like
 overnight
 it's
 not


just
 it
 was
 regime
 change
 of
 Venezuela,


but
 the
 US
 has
 a
 new
 territory.
 It
 will


be
 run
 by
 um
 you
 know,
 who
 knows,
 new


governor,
 new
 prime
 minister,
 protector


of
 Venezuela.
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 But
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future,
 uh,
 Venezuela
 will


be
 under
 US
 control
 and
 eventually
 it


looks
 like
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


investment
 into
 Venezuela
 and
 there's


going
 to
 be
 more
 oil
 flowing
 out.
 So,


this
 this
 is
 a
 big
 big
 big
 geopolitical


move
 and
 it
 has
 some
 winners
 and
 losers.


The
 clear
 winners
 of
 course
 are
 the
 US


oil
 companies.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 go
 in
 and
 uh
 operate
 on
 those


resources.
 Chevron
 was
 already
 there.


Uh,
 it
 looks
 like
 other
 people
 are
 going


to
 come
 in
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 very
 good


for
 the
 US
 oil
 industry.
 It's
 going
 to


be
 very
 good
 for
 inflation
 and
 the


global
 consumer.
 If
 you
 have
 Venezuela


there
 with
 all
 this
 oil,
 but
 just
 kind


of
 not
 having
 the
 infrastructure
 to
 be


able
 to
 extract
 it.
 Now
 the
 supply
 of


oil
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up.
 That's
 going
 to


mean
 down
 pressure
 on
 oil
 prices.
 Not


immediately,
 of
 course.
 It's
 going
 to


take
 time
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 the


facility
 set
 up,
 but
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 few


years,
 you
 can
 easily
 see
 the
 supply
 of


oil
 go
 up,
 oil
 prices
 uh
 go
 down.
 So


this
 is
 u
 good
 for
 again
 the
 war
 on


inflation.
 If
 you
 remember
 in
 January
 of


2025,
 Trump
 actually
 openly
 said
 that


his
 plan
 to
 get
 inflation
 lower
 is
 to


get
 more
 oil
 and
 you
 have
 OPEC
 pump
 more


oil.
 You
 have
 oil
 prices
 down
 a
 lot
 and


now
 it
 looks
 like
 this
 is
 um
 this
 is


maybe
 another
 part
 of
 that.


You
 do
 have
 clear
 losers
 as
 well.
 Now,


of
 course,
 aside
 from
 President
 Moduro,


who
 is
 now,
 it
 seems,
 on
 a
 ship,
 uh,


you
 know,
 it
 seems
 like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a


chart
 where
 Venezuela
 was
 selling
 its


oil,
 a
 lot
 of
 was
 going
 to
 China.
 Now,


Venezuela
 was
 a
 staunch
 ally
 of
 China,


of
 Russia,
 and
 of
 Iran.
 And
 so
 now
 that


team
 is
 losing
 a
 big
 ally.
 Now,
 China
 is


still
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 oil
 from


Venezuela.
 Now,
 the
 president
 was
 very


clear
 that,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to


pump
 more
 oil
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 sell
 it


to
 everyone.
 So,
 China
 is
 still
 going
 to


get
 more
 oil,
 but
 they
 probably
 won't


get
 it
 at
 the
 same
 discounted
 price.


Venezuelan
 oil
 was
 sanctioned.
 It
 really


couldn't
 go
 to
 the
 global
 market.
 And


so,
 they
 had
 to
 sell
 it
 at
 a
 discount
 to


other
 people,
 similar
 to
 what
 Russia


does,
 right?
 Russia
 oil
 was
 sanctioned.


They
 sell
 it
 at
 a
 discount
 to
 other


countries.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 China
 was
 getting


discounted
 oil.
 Now,
 they're
 not
 getting


discounted
 oil
 anymore.
 China
 was


friends
 with
 Venezuela.
 In
 fact,
 reports


suggest
 that
 they
 had
 a
 Chinese


delegation
 being
 sent
 to
 Venezuela
 just


in
 a
 few
 hours
 before
 the
 operation.


Now,
 it
 looks
 like
 they've
 lost
 a
 key


ally
 in
 Latin
 America.


Um,
 this
 of
 course
 could
 also
 point
 to


trouble
 for
 uh
 allies
 of
 uh
 President


Maduro,
 say
 Cuba,
 for
 example,
 longtime


thorn
 in
 the
 side
 of
 the
 US.
 You
 know,


doesn't
 have
 any
 oil
 but
 uh
 not
 friends


with
 the
 US.
 And
 of
 course,
 um,


Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 is
 of


Cuban
 descent.
 And
 of
 course,
 uh,
 the


Cuban
 community
 in
 the
 US
 really
 doesn't


like
 what's
 happening
 in
 Cuba.
 And
 so
 I


think
 he
 should
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 worried.


If
 you
 are
 Iran,
 you
 could
 probably
 be


upset
 as
 well.
 You're
 losing
 another


ally.
 But
 it
 also
 tells
 you
 very
 clearly


that
 the
 president
 is
 a
 man
 of
 action.


He
 says
 many
 things,
 but
 he
 also
 has


done
 many
 things
 as
 well.
 um
 many
 things


other
 presidents
 would
 not
 have
 done


right
 directly
 strike
 Iran
 bombs
 huge


huge
 clampdown
 on
 illegal
 immigration


everywhere
 in
 the
 country
 of
 course


strikes
 on
 Venezuela
 but
 he's
 also
 said


other
 things
 that
 he
 hasn't
 done
 yet
 so


let's
 say
 that
 you
 are
 the
 prime


minister
 of
 Denmark
 who
 of
 course


controls
 Greenland
 president
 has
 said


that
 you
 know
 Greenland
 is
 very
 very


important
 to
 us
 from
 a
 national
 security


standpoint
 so
 does
 that
 increase
 the


probability
 that
 you
 know
 maybe
 one
 day


Greenland
 will
 have
 to
 change
 hands
 as


well.
 Of
 course,
 the
 president
 also
 made


comments
 about
 Canada
 and
 we
 we
 don't


know
 what
 will
 happen
 there.
 One
 thing


to
 note
 though
 is
 that
 strategically


speaking,
 the
 oil
 that
 Venezuela
 pumps


is
 heavy
 crude.
 That's
 the
 same
 stuff


that
 Canada
 pumps
 to
 as
 well.
 And
 right


now,
 Canada
 has
 one
 captain
 consumer,


the
 United
 States.
 And
 the
 United
 States


is
 relying
 upon
 Canadian
 heavy
 crude
 as


well.
 That's
 what
 the
 refiners
 are


optimized
 for.
 If
 you
 have
 another


source
 of
 heavy
 crude
 come
 online
 from


Venezuela,
 that
 really
 really
 decreases


the
 bargaining
 power
 that
 Canadian
 oil


companies
 have.
 And
 of
 course,
 that
 is
 a


big
 problem
 from
 a
 geostrategic


way
 for
 for
 Canada
 and
 maybe
 why
 Prime


Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 is
 eager
 to


greenlight
 another
 pipeline
 so
 that
 they


have
 other
 outlets
 for
 Canadian
 oil.


So,
 one
 other
 thing,
 of
 course,
 we
 have


to
 think
 about
 is
 that
 what
 other
 thing


has
 Trump
 um
 kind
 of
 obsessed
 about
 over


and
 over
 again,
 um
 that's
 lower
 interest


rates.
 And
 as
 I
 wrote
 last
 week,
 my


blog,
 the
 market
 is
 really
 not
 pricing


in
 that
 Trump
 will
 get
 his
 way.
 I
 the


market
 really
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 think


that,
 you
 know,
 prices
 interest
 rates


the
 same
 way
 they
 did
 months
 ago.
 So


they
 don't
 really
 place
 probability
 on


President
 Trump
 actually
 getting
 his
 way


and
 able
 to
 lower
 interest
 rates
 even


though
 the
 president
 has
 you
 know
 done
 a


lot
 of
 really
 obvious
 moves
 to
 try
 to
 do


that.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 continues
 to
 be
 a


significant
 mispricing
 of
 the
 market.
 So


uh
 president
 has
 a
 track
 record
 of
 uh


acting
 on
 things
 that
 he
 cares
 a
 lot


about.
 So
 markets
 will
 be
 exciting
 this


next
 week.
 Guessing
 that
 you
 know
 I


since
 it
 was
 so
 effortless.
 Maybe
 not


even
 that
 big
 of
 an
 impact,
 but
 you


know,
 if
 you
 have
 lower
 oil
 prices
 in


the
 future,
 maybe
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


downward
 pressure
 on
 inflation.
