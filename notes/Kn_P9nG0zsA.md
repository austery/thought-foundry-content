title: 服务器、云计算与未来：Oxide的硬件软件创新之路
---
### 互联网泡沫与创新驱动

主持人开场提问了关于互联网泡沫时期的情况，以及AI工具如何改变了 **Oxide** 的工作方式。**Brian Caner**，曾是 **Sun Microsystems** 的杰出工程师，亲历了互联网的繁荣与萧条，后来创立了 **Joyent**（**AWS** 的早期竞争者），现在是 **Oxide** 的联合创始人。他指出，在互联网泡沫破裂时期，他们反而完成了更多技术上有趣的工作。他认为，创新在某种程度上需要一定程度的绝望，而在经济繁荣时期，这种绝望感很难被激发。AI工具在 **Oxide** 主要作为“润色工具”使用，而非创造的核心。本期播客将深入探讨服务器和云计算的历史，从1990年代末至今，以及从零开始构建 **Oxide** 计算机等硬件所面临的挑战。此外，还将讨论 **Oxide** 团队如何使用AI，为何他们认为AI在硬件工程挑战中几乎无用，以及 **Oxide** 为何将所有产品开源，以及作为一家硬件初创公司如何实现远程工作等。本期节目由 **Statsig** 赞助，这是一个用于功能标志、分析和实验的统一平台。

Can you tell us about the .com boom? We did much more technically interesting work in the bust than we did in the boom. There's a degree to which innovation requires some level of desperation that good economic times are kind of hard to summon that desperation. How have AI tools changed how you're working at Oxide? Certainly we're using cloud code a bunch and people are doing that but for a lot of the work that we're doing it is helpful as maybe a polishing tool but less as at the epicenter of its creation. Can you tell me what it actually means to design or build a computer? Oh, it's very involved. Yeah, it's very involved. So, first of all, how have servers and cloud infrastructure evolved since the late 1990s and what is next? Brian Caner was a distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems during the com boom and comb bust. Built a small competitor to AWS called Joyant and is now the co-founder at Oxide. Today, we go into the history of servers in the cloud from the late 1990s to today. the challenges of building hardware like the Oxide computer from scratch. How the Oxide team uses AI and why they find it practically useless for hardware engineering challenges. Why Oxide builds everything as open source and how they manage to work remotely as a hardware startup and many more. If you'd like to understand more about how the cloud works, and learn how Nimble hardware plus software startup operates, this episode is for you. This podcast episode is presented by Statsig, the Unifi platform for flags, analytics, experiments, and more. Check out the show notes below to learn more about them and our other season sponsor. So Brian, welcome to the podcast.

### 90年代互联网的勃兴与Sun的辉煌

**Brian Caner** 回忆起90年代中期，互联网正处于爆发前夜。他于1995年面试，1996年加入 **Sun Microsystems**。那时，HTTP协议刚开发不久，第一批网页浏览器也才出现，互联网正蓄势待发。**Java** 语言在1995年左右发布后迅速普及，带来了巨大的兴奋和活力。他从美国东部来到硅谷，被这里非凡的能量所吸引，并决定在这里发展自己的职业生涯。在 **Sun** 的几年里，他觉得自己非常幸运，因为 **Sun** 在正确的时间、正确的地点拥有了正确的技术。那是一个爆炸性的时期，如果你想在互联网泡沫中建立网站，你就会购买 **Sun** 的服务器和 **Cisco** 的交换机。当时，个人电脑（PC）无法直接作为服务器使用，因为缺乏合适的操作系统。**Linux** 尚处于早期，更像是业余爱好者的项目。**BSD** 系统也受到 **AT&T** 诉讼的阴影。**GNU Hurd** 操作系统则是一个“永远在开发中”的项目，迟迟未能发布。因此，在PC上运行服务器并不实际，这也正是 **Sun** 吸引 **Brian** 的原因之一，他对在 **x86** 架构上使用 **Solaris** 操作系统充满期待。

Oh, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me. I'd love to jump back in time a lot back in the 1990s because you're someone who's been around the block and back then you worked at some interesting companies including at Sun and if you could give us listeners and and viewers a sense of what was it like in the '9s in terms of software servers, what was the vibe like? Yeah, it was an interesting inflection point because I was interviewing in 1995. I started in 1996. So, uh I would say that the the internet and I mean we HTTP had been developed in like 9394. We had kind of the first web browsers but it was still very very very new and the internet was just kind of primed for takeoff. Java had been Java had come out in maybe 1995. Java had kind of taken off immediately. So there was a lot of uh really exciting energy, but it was nowhere near what it would become a couple year even a couple years later it became very frothy of course and it was exciting. Um it was very clear to me I went to school actually in the east coast but just coming out here to Silicon Valley the energy was was extraordinary um and really knew that I wanted to come out here for my career. So at Sun those next couple of years I mean I I got very lucky really because Sun was in the right place at the right time with the right technology which you know sometimes you only appreciate in hindsight um because it was so explosive and if you wanted to build a website as part of that com boom you were buying Sun servers you were buying Cisco switches now why was this the case because again just taking myself back just being a bit naive I would assume that let's Hey, I'm in the 1995. I want to build a website. Could have not just used a PC and spun up a server. Did it not work like that or how did it work? You I mean a PC like maybe but you didn't really have an operating system, right? Because you Linux is Linux is very very new. Linux is not I'll back down. Oh yeah, definitely. Linux is you know uh would be like haiku today which is an operating system you haven't heard of for a reason. It's kind of like a hobbyist operating system. You know what I mean? You'd be like what? No, you wouldn't. And you then you kind of had the BSDs were out the free BSD was certainly out there. Also still very much under the shadow though of this lawsuit from AT&T. So the unices are kind there's not really open- source operating system options. Uh there was the um actually this is kind of funny because so where was the GNU option? Uh it was going to be the herd operating system. So Herd was kind of like the Duke Nukem forever of its time. It was the operating system that was constantly coming kind of next year and next year and next year and it was going to be micro kernel based and so you know that it's kind of amazing but you really couldn't do it on on PCs because of the lack of system software and actually part of my attraction to Sun was I had used Solaris on Spark but I never I knew Solaris existed on x86 but I never used it. So I was excited to use Solaris on x86.

### Sun的产品与互联网泡沫的狂热

**Sun Microsystems** 主要构建服务器，包括基于 **SPARC** 架构的服务器、台式机和一些不太成功的笔记本电脑。在90年代，从工作组服务器到大型机器，市场需求呈爆炸式增长。**Sun** 生产的服务器在物理尺寸上与 **Oxide** 如今制造的机器相似。**Sun** 当时的首席技术官 **Greg Papadopoulos** 曾向全公司强调，**Sun** 的三大主要应用是“数据库、数据库和数据库”。这反映了当时服务器的主要用途。在互联网泡沫的上升期，如果企业想要建立强大的网络存在，他们会选择 **Java**、**Solaris** 操作系统和 **Sun** 服务器。那是一个狂野的时代，充满了狂热。**Brian Caner** 认为，虽然AI现在令人兴奋，但互联网泡沫时期也同样特别。他回忆道，泡沫时期工作节奏狂热，但并非总是积极的。事实上，他在泡沫破裂后，反而完成了更多技术上有趣的工作。他解释说，在繁荣时期，人们往往会错误地认为成功是由于自己的努力或所从事的技术，这种自满情绪不利于真正的创新。

And so what did Sun build? You mentioned Solaris. That was the operating system. Solar is the operating system. We built servers. So we built Sparkbased servers. Um we built a desktop machines. So we Sun was a computer company. It was a systems company. So So we built desktop machines, built some ill-advised laptops. So basically desktop machines, workstations. But then at that time in the 90s, what was really exploding were everything from those kind of workg groupoup style servers up to really getting bigger and bigger servers up to um the very large machines, machines that are as physically the same size as what Oxide makes today. And I remember vividly in what would have been like 9798 maybe Greg Papadopoulos then the the CTO of Sun giving it to the entire company saying here are the top three applications for Sun micros systemystems databases, databases and databases. So that gives you an idea of kind of how it was being used. And this is again as that kind of in that that that knee up of that.com buildout where if you again if you wanted to really build a web presence, you were going to use you were going to use Java, you were going to use you do it on Solaris, you're going to do it on Sun servers. Um and you were going to and it was kind of it was a wild time for sure. And can you tell us about the dotcom boom because you know right now I know AI is pretty exciting and it feels like we're in a special time but what what was it like especially working on it sounds like it was at the it was the epicenter of it and you know what was funny is I did uh it was frenetic in a way that was not always positive. So, one of the things that is that is just a point of fact and one can take from what what one will I did we did much more technically interesting work in the bust than we did in the boom cuz I think that when you're in boom times you know everyone kind of like secretly believes that this is because of me like I that it is because of the thing that I am working on if I you know I once had you know one of the one of the the early technologies behind Java once told me with a straight every server that Sun sells they sell because of Java and I'm like you know what you know what's most amazing I you believe that is actually the more interesting fact that I mean it is like obviously false especially with you know databases databases databases being the top three applications but that that kind of reflects the zeitgeist of the time that everyone believes that this is you know if I work on the microprocessor it's because of the the the microprocessor is perfect if I work on the operating system it's because oh this is the operating system that people are buying the the machine for and it like that doesn't really lend itself to really to to real innovation. I think I think there's a degree to which like innovation requires some level of desperation that good economic times are it's kind of hard to summon that desperation sometimes. So, I think that during the boom it was and it was just it was frothy and it felt like there was a period of time where I'm like this obviously can't go on forever and you know the economist is having these very like gloomy covers about how this is all going to end and it's going to be an apocalypse which I believed and then I just stopped believing it. And I'm like, well maybe the economist is right. It just went on longer. And you know, one of my early life lessons from the boom and bust is these things go on longer than you think possible.

### 泡沫破裂与经济现实

**Brian Caner** 总结了互联网泡沫时期的一个重要经验：繁荣时期会比你想象的持续更久，但一旦转向，崩溃的速度会比你想象的更快。在泡沫时期，客户对服务器的需求极其旺盛，产品供不应求。日常工作中，这意味着交通拥堵、住房紧张，一切都供不应求。他回忆起一个客户曾计划购买19,000台服务器，用于一个宽带项目，这家公司就是臭名昭著的 **Enron**。他生动地描述了当时奢华的商业晚宴，人们点着九道菜，喝着珍贵的1952年 **Château d'Yquem** 甜酒。在那个狂欢的夜晚，他心中升起一种预感：“这不可能持续下去，这是不可持续的。”他感觉互联网泡沫仿佛就在那一夜破裂。2000年9月，**Pets.com** 和纳斯达克指数在年初就已经开始崩盘。2000年初，交通状况明显好转，从拥堵变为像疫情期间一样空旷，而当时并没有疫情发生，只有纳斯达克崩盘。到了2000年9月，电信公司的订单量直接降至零，整个行业陷入低谷。

<summary>Original English</summary>

But when they growth in terms of the boom, when you're in frothy times, that boom will go on longer than you think possible. Mhm. And when it switches, it will collapse faster than you can fathom. In the boom, do I understand correctly that customers were just like wanting to buy your servers? They were flying off the shelves. all these companies and on a day-to-day work what did it what did it mean for you? So I'll tell you like in daytoday it meant first of all it meant that traffic was terrible that the you know there is you couldn't get housing you couldn't get you know everything was in short supply you couldn't uh customers are you know they are buying we had a customer that you know was but was going to buy 19,000 servers which is obviously a big very big number and and these were these massive big servers right yeah well in that case those were actually one use servers to build out a broadband initiative that actually was a company called Enron you know I remember vividly we were at a a a dinner uh here in the city at a at a restaurant called Aqua which is a very kind of fancy restaurant long since out of business and I don't think Aqua survived the bust and we were at Aqua with a with a bank who was a a customer of Suns and they were spending a galactic amount of money every year with Sun and we were at a dinner and I just remember I mean it was it was the kind of like 19th century guilded age kind of dinner. People are ordering you know nine courses. What I remember is at the end of that having chateau deem which is a sotern. So I don't know very much I don't know very little about wine. I know nothing about so turns. What I did know is there was someone who knew wine and it's like we are going to all drink the 1952 chateau demot which is which is and and I remember being like I'm like I'm not much of a drinker but I was like too drunk at that point to really appreciate it. So I have had this so turn that you know that that enophiles kind of live their life to to drink and I'm sad to inform you that there's one less bottle of this precious vintage because it was poured down the gullet of a 20-some dotr who really had and I just remember being back in my apartment being literally drunk on chateau deem thinking to my inro hill and remember thinking to myself this can't last this is not sustainable and I swear the.com boom turned to a bust like that night. I that is that is September of 2000. So the uh pets.com had kind of busted out and the bunch of NASDAQ had busted out early in 2000. Uh the traffic got lighter early in 2000. Anyone who was here would be like that the absolute spookiest thing is it went from like gridlock to like COVID like traffic in the span of like a month without co happening without co happening with only the NASDAQ collapsing. and you're like, "Okay, that's very odd." And then 2000 kind of muddled along and then the with the that dinner was in September of 2000 and uh the what really stopped was the telco buildout. So that there was a lot of telco build up because people are like the internet is the future and telco build up meaning the towers the server the servers the infrastructure for and then all of the conccommittent the the fiber like JDS unif was a huge company you you had these companies that were you know global crossing and and MCI WorldCom and all these companies were explosive and everyone believed that the internet is the future and this is like an important thing important and they were right they were right

### AI代理与软件开发的新范式

**Brian Caner** 提到，互联网泡沫时期的一个重要教训是，那些相信互联网是未来的人最终是正确的，只是时机不对。如今，我们正处于一个类似的AI时代，AI很可能成为未来软件栈的一部分，尽管时机难以预测。最新的转变是 **AI代理**（AI Agents）在开发中变得越来越普遍。本期节目的赞助商 **Linear** 在这方面采取了独特的方法：他们没有构建专有的AI助手，而是提供了开放的API和SDK，允许任何代理接入其问题追踪器。这意味着开发者无需等待 **Linear** 构建所需功能，可以直接连接市场上最佳的编码代理，如 **Cursor**、**GitHub Copilot**、**OpenAI CodeX** 和 **Devon**，或者为团队特定工作流程构建自己的代理。这种方法与大多数问题追踪和项目管理工具截然不同，它提供了选择性，并且体验非常自然。你可以像分配给同事一样将问题分配给代理，或者在问题讨论中提及代理。代理可以接收错误报告，理解问题上下文，打开拉取请求（PR），探索修复方案，而人类则专注于其他任务，甚至进行根本原因分析。**Brian** 强调，人类仍然是责任所有者，代理是为人类工作，而非取代人类。

<summary>Original English</summary>

Brian just said how an important lesson to Alcom boom was that people who believe the interim will be the future, they were right. Today we're in a similar stage with AI. It's pretty likely that AI will be part of the software stack in the future, even if timing is harder to predict. The latest shift is how AI agents are becoming a lot more commonly used for development. And this is a great time to talk about our season sponsor, Linear, and how they think about collaborating with agents. Linear has taken an interesting approach here. Instead of building one proprietary AI assistant and locking you into it, they built an open API and SDK that lets any agent plug into your issue tracker. That means you don't need to wait for linear to build the features that you need. You can connect the best coding agents on the market like Cursor, GitHub, Copilot, OpenAI, Codeex, and Devon or you can build your own agent for your team specific workflow. It's a fundamentally different approach from most issue tracking and project management tools on the market. You get optionality and the experience is surprisingly natural. You assign an issue to an agent the same way you'd assign it to a teammate or you can simply mention the agent in an issue thread. Curser then can pick up a bug, understand the context from the issue, open a PR code can explore a fix while you're focused on something else, centric and root cause analysis when something breaks. It's pretty powerful what you can get these agents to do. And here's what I like. You, the human stays the accountable owner. The agent works for you, not instead of you. You review the work. You decide when it's good and when it ships. If agents are going to be a part of the tool set of building software, and it feels to me they increasingly are, you'll want a system that's actually designed for them. Linear is a system like this. To learn more, head to linear.app/aents. And with this, let's get back to the point where Brian was saying how those believing the internet will be the future back in 2001 were right. This is the other thing. It's like they're right. And so like a very famous impact creator from the.com boom is is webband right webband was delivering groceries which many people today are going to get their groceries delivered right right instart. It's like they weren't wrong but their timing was off and they lost track of the underlying economics completely. And so when it busted out, so in in the the fall of 2000, uh in November of 2000 in particular, there were there were zero orders from telecoms at Sun. Like it went to zero. Wow. And every and you know, you're kind of used to kind of ups and downs, but that's like just like off a cliff. And from that point, we you know, going to 2000 and then and then 2001 and it was then very very grim. I would say that the thing that that happened through the bust and layoff after layoff after layoff and cuz companies had kind of built themselves and geared themselves around these fat times lasting forever and now they were gone and expectations as frothy as expectations were during the boom. They were that much negative in the bus. People were like everything is it's it's the end of days

### 泡沫破裂后的技术创新

**Brian Caner** 强调，互联网泡沫破裂后，电信行业的订单在2000年11月降至零，这导致了大规模裁员。许多公司曾以为好日子会永远持续，但当泡沫破裂时，他们的期望也随之崩塌，人们普遍感到“世界末日”来临。然而，**Brian** 认为，那些真正对技术感兴趣的人留在了硅谷，并未受到太大影响。虽然公司股票价值大幅缩水（**Sun** 损失了98%的价值），但泡沫破裂也让人们重新思考什么才是真正重要的。他指出，在泡沫破裂时期，**Sun** 团队完成了更多更好的技术工作。资源减少反而激发了更多创造力。例如，**ZFS**（一个革命性的文件系统）、**DTrace**（一个动态系统追踪工具）以及服务管理工具等，这些对操作系统具有革命性意义的技术，都诞生于2001年至2005年的泡沫破裂后时期。这些创新证明，即使在经济低迷时期，技术进步也从未停止，甚至可能因为更专注而变得更容易创新。

<summary>Original English</summary>

and and were you a software engineer back then? Yeah, software engineer. Yep. And then so as a software engineer like both you and also thinking about your your colleagues back at the time or friends how did it impact you? Were you kind of just chugging along or so I would say that like lots of people left and you had like the statistic of you know the U-Hauls were 10 to1 out of the Bay Area. So you the the moved away and the the thing that I noticed is that the people that had moved out to Silicon Valley because they were they really had a a an interest in the technology all were there all stayed and were not adversely affected honestly. I mean I the um yes we every one of us if you had equity in your company which of course you all did like you try not to overthink it right you just try to like you try to remind yourself like I never had it to begin with so like it's hard to you know but it's definitely gone sun lost 98% of its value um so it's like definitely gone and you know there was something and I think it also like a boom can get you to care about things that you actually don't care about and a boom can get you to because in a boom everyone is so financially driven that it's hard not to become financially driven. But it's like that's actually not why I got into this. And so during the bust, I'm, you know, definitely able to put, you know, put a meal on my table and a roof over my head. Um, but the uh it was really a reminder about like what's important and again because we did we did do better technical work in the bus than we did in the boom. And I think it's because in the bust it's like okay now like we really we have to focus we we have fewer resources that that the fewer resources actually force more creativity. So you know all of the things that we did certainly speaking at Sun and system software so ZFS and Drace and the service management facility all these things that were really revolutionary for the operating system all happened in the same kind of postbust period of time. So they all those all of those things happened from 2001 to say 2005 and and so what were these specific innovations?

### 开源软件与x86架构的崛起

**Brian Caner** 解释了 **ZFS** 和 **DTrace** 这两项重要创新。**ZFS** 是一个由 **Jeff Bonwick** 和 **Matt Erenss** 在2000年代初从零开始重新设计的革命性文件系统。而 **DTrace** 则是 **Brian** 与两位同事共同开发的工具，允许动态地检测运行中的系统，以更好地理解和调试。这些技术创新虽然不完全归因于泡沫破裂，但其时机恰好与泡沫破裂时期重叠。更重要的是，**Sun** 在2005年将整个操作系统开源，这为这些技术赋予了“永恒的生命”。进入2000年代，技术格局发生了巨大变化。首先是**开源软件**的崛起。90年代中期，**Linux** 还是一个业余项目，但到了2000年代，它已经成熟，并得到了 **IBM**、**SGI** 等公司的支持，贡献了 **XFS** 等重要技术。**Google** 从一开始就基于 **Linux** 构建，下一波互联网繁荣的公司都依赖开源。其次，**SPARC** 架构在与 **x86** 的竞争中失利。90年代，**RISC** 架构的处理器（如 **SPARC**、**MIPS**、**Alpha**）速度更快，而 **x86** 只是商品化的PC处理器。但到了90年代末，**Intel** 专注于解决“内存墙”问题，通过**推测执行**（Speculative Execution: 一种处理器优化技术，在程序实际需要之前执行指令）等技术，使得 **x86** 处理器速度超越了 **RISC**。到2004-2005年，**x86** 成为领先的微处理器。

So I'd gone to work at Sun to be to work with Jeff Bonwick and as long as I had known Jeff from the mid '90s Jeff had wanted to rethink file systems and now finally in the early 2000s uh he and Matt Erenss were able to really go take a clean sheet of paper from the file system and that's CFS. I had a a chip on my shoulder about the way we understand and debug systems by the way we observe systems. So I along with two other colleagues um did dra which allowed us to dynamically instrument running systems and you can kind of go down the line and there were there were a bunch of things like this where we and I I I don't know that all of this is related to the bust. It's just that the timing lined up such that it was all happening during the bust and what we ended up with was a whole bunch of interesting technology coming together actually in a single version of the operating system and then very I mean fortunate for us and I do think this is a bit of a consequence of the bust because sun was definitely open to to new approaches we open sourced all the operating system so that happened in 2005 and that was very important to to give these kind of technologies eternal life but I think you know we can never predict the future but to me it's it is pretty positive in this sense that even in the bus hearing the stories that innovation did not stop. Sure, you know, sounds like it was probably harder to get jobs and and there there might have been fewer of them, but you know, industry kept innovating and and what you what you said that I didn't expect to hear that it was a bit easier to innovate. It's just less manic. We were able to focus more and so not that now I mean not that one should uh necessarily pine for a bust because busts are brutal, but there is a clarity that you get too. Um, so I mean ideally you would like to have just like can we just be like normal economically but like nope. Apparently in high-tech we've got to be like on or off. So bust aside in the early 2000s leading up to this internet boom the way to you know most companies went about buying Sun servers with Solaris installed and everything was hardware and software came together. It was beautiful. It worked well. Again I I heard from from folks who did it. What happened then? Cuz when I I got into second in 2000 I did not hear about Solaris and that that was not how it No. Right. That's what was the shift. So the shift was first of all open source, right? So then so you know we said in the mid90s Linux was kind of still very much a hobby project. Not so by the 2000s, right? So grew up it grew up absolutely and it grew up because you had a bunch of companies that really backed up the truck and you know the things that at first IBM and SGI data general some other companies those companies were very important because they decided to contribute their technologies like XFS right XFS many people still use today on Linux that's from SGI XFS was SGI on IRX that was happening in kind of those the late 90s and then in the 2000s I mean Google was always built on Linux right And so you had kind of the the companies that that became that that next boom were all built on open source and indeed needed to be built on open source. So they economically relied on open source to be able to build what they built. So then it became much more practical to certainly run Linux and I think the the other BSDs or they I we open source Solera. So there were a lot of options that were now available. So that shifted. I think the other thing that that that shifted is that I mean Spark bluntly lost to x86 and you sun for and and spark is a Harvard architecture. Spark is a microprocessor. Yeah. And and uh there was because there was a time in the '9s when if you wanted the fastest microprocessor it was a risk microprocessor. It was it was from it was a spark microp processor or it was MIP or it was alpha. and x86 was was a commodity but was was uh and obviously available with a personal computer but was not faster than those those risk microp processors that shifted that shifted in the late '9s and we you know because we ran the operating system on that was in Solaris on both Spark and x86 we could see how fast these x86 machines were and could see frankly how like you know you talk to the micro electronics folks they really did not they they kind of dismissed x86 and dismissed Intel and you shouldn't do that And in particular, Intel was was very focused and architected their way around what was called the memory wall. Um, and they were able in part because they use speculative execution. They were able to actually make these microprocessors that were became much faster than the risk microp processor. So by the time say you are in 2004 2005, if you want a leading edge microp processor, it's x86. So that that was a a big and important shift. So by the time you're coming up, it's like, okay, yeah, if I want this, if I I'll I'll just like I don't know, get a like a Dell box or super micro box and then I'll I'll put Linux on it or maybe FreeBSD and and away I go. Then the the next kind of big and important shift that happened started in 2006. You could you could argue with with S3, but then especially in those next kind of seven 8 n with the introduction of EC2 and now you have like the the cloud that starts to come into play and now like people were like why would I even like screw out of the server at all? I mean it was so great to be able to just spin up infrastructure.

### 云计算的兴起与Oracle的收购

随着 **x86** 架构的普及，人们开始选择购买 **Dell** 或 **Super Micro** 的服务器，安装 **Linux** 或 **FreeBSD**。2006年，云计算开始崭露头角，特别是 **AWS S3** 的推出，随后是 **EC2**。云计算的出现改变了游戏规则，人们不再需要自己管理服务器，而是可以直接“启动基础设施”。**Brian Caner** 回忆起他早期公司在2000年代中期仍有服务器机房和管理员，机房总是很热，这在当时是每个公司的常态。云计算的弹性基础设施和API驱动的特性非常重要。2006年，**Brian** 在 **Sun** 内部创立了一个存储部门，该部门非常成功，甚至吸引了 **Oracle** 成为客户。他半开玩笑地说，这让他有点“羞愧”，因为他可能“引来了吞噬公司的海洋顶级捕食者”。**Oracle** 最终在2010年初收购了 **Sun**。**Brian** 很快离开了 **Oracle**，并在2011年的一次演讲中毫不掩饰地表达了对 **Oracle** 和 **Larry Ellison** 的看法。他告诫人们不要将 **Larry Ellison** 拟人化，而应将其视为一台机器，就像割草机一样，如果你把手伸进去，它就会切掉。

Yeah. I I remember one of my early companies mid 2000s, we we had a server room. We had server administrators. The server room was always hot. And this was a small company, mind you. This was not not not a big one. Every company needed to do that. It's kind of amazing to think it's like that every single company, no matter if you were a website, you had your own server room. And if you were a dev, you wanted to be friends with the server admin because when you wanted to deploy your stuff, you you know, they they could do stuff for you. They could do stuff for you. That or that's it totally. And so I think that cloud computing was really important. This is not a deep thought that elastic infrastructure was really important but the ability to have APIdriven infrastructure. Um and that so for me personally so I was I was at Sun and then from in 2006 I started a storage group inside of Sun which was great. Um really successful group but so successful that it actually attracted Oracle as a customer for the first time in a long time. I kind of this is like a little bit of like residual like shame that I have that like did I attract the the the marine apex predator that ate the company cuz Oracle later stunt right and then they bought sun in and uh and that closed in early 2010. Um I left shortly thereafter because I could see what Oracle was. Well, I never heard a story of your potential role here. That's right. So I Yeah. and uh uh Oracle and I and I gave some maybe a year later I gave a talk uh in 2011 with some rather unvarnished opinions about Oracle and Larry Ellison in particular I cautioned people about anthropomorphizing Larry Ellison you you have to treat Larry Ellison as as a machine uh like a lawn mower you stick your hand in the lawn mower it'll chop it off well this is so all right so I I I I'm giving this talk in 2011 again this is after I've left I've I've left what was then Oracle and uh you know I was just saying things that I felt were were obvious but people you know the audience is kind of gasping and you know it's like and people are coming up to you after the talk like do you think there's going to be like it's gonna be retribution from Oracle no you're misunderstanding like there's no the lawn mower is not angry at you it's a it's a machine it doesn't it doesn't have it doesn't have the mirror neurons to be I would almost like I it would almost u show me that I'm wrong for Oracle to resent what I'm saying about the anyway so but all the videos for that conference go up and my video does not go up

### Oracle事件与云计算的演变

**Brian Caner** 的演讲视频被会议组织者“雪藏”，因为他们害怕得罪 **Oracle**。最终视频上线时，还附带了免责声明，并在 **Brian** 演讲时全程显示在他头上。这反映了 **Oracle** 在行业中的巨大影响力。大约在2010年至2014年间，**AWS** 展现了无情的执行力，不断降价并推出新服务，几乎没有其他公共云选项能与之抗衡。**Google Cloud Platform**（**GCP**）在纸面上虽然从2009年就存在，但直到2014年之前，它几乎是个笑话。**AWS** 的成功在于它给人们一种“云计算是个糟糕生意”的错觉，因为它没有公布财务数据，并且每年降价。但实际上，**AWS S3** 的高利润正在补贴 **Amazon** 的零售业务，例如 **Prime** 会员的免费送货。**Brian** 曾创立的 **Joyent** 是一家与 **AWS** 竞争的公共云公司，他们深知公共云的利润丰厚。**Joyent** 的独特之处在于，它不仅提供公共云服务，还将运行公共云的软件提供给那些希望在自己的硬件上运行私有云的客户。

oh Right. Okay. And so my colleagues were like, "This is an Oracle conspiracy." I'm like, "This is not an Oracle conspiracy," which it wasn't. It wasn't orchestrated by Oracle, but what I did I what I underestimated was the fear of the conference organizers. So they themselves were terrified of offending Oracle. Yes. Even though it probably would have been fine. No. So the talk did finally go up. Before the talk starts, there is a disclaimer. The views in this talk do not represent the views of the US association. And you're like, "All right, I get it. Like never seen this disclaimer before, but fine. Then during the talk, you know, the format of the talk is you got a slide and then you've got like a little blank script and then you got this talking head in the lower right corner. There's like kind of this dead space above the speaker. They took this disclaimer and they rejustified it and they put it above my head the entire time I'm speaking. So if you and in I mean and maybe in this regard they were preanted because to this day if Ellison is mentioned on hacker news or Oracle's mention on hacker news someone will immediately cite minute 33 of this talk which is when I go on this kind of Oracle again I don't view it as a rant I view it as just like me describing what is obviously true that we all know but anyway so I I had left uh I left Oracle after after they bought so so we're we're now around like 2,000. So cloud has taken off. x86 architecture is everywhere. Linux is is now winning both for smalltime servers but also on the cloud. And then what happens? This was an interesting time when Google started to figure out that hey they could do something interesting on their cloud, right? Yeah, that's right. So this is still a little bit before that. So this is in kind of from I would say from 2010 to about 2014 is when is a period of relentless execution from AWS. AWS is executing. so extremely well. There are not really other public cloud options. There's like kind of Azure kind of drifting out there. I think people people forget that that you know like GCP on paper has been around from 2009 but up to like 2014 it was like it was almost like a joke. It was a joke. I would say before it was it like it existed but it was a joke and the and in particular at every single reinvent Amazon would announce a new price cut. And if you were a competitor to AWS you were like dreading reinvent because here comes another price cut. If you are a partner of AWS, you're dreading reinvent because here comes the announcement of a new service that competes with what you're making. I I think people who have not been around have forgotten, but it really has happened and cuz it's not been the norm the last like let's say 5 10 years or so. Well, and in particular, they did a couple things are just like, man, you got to tip your hat to just I mean Jeff Bezos is the apex predator of capitalism. like Larry Ellison may be the lawn mower, but Bezos is ultimately the apex predator because the thing that was so impressive is they were able to give people the idea that this was a terrible business. So, in particular, they did not break out their financials. So, everyone's like, "Oh my god, what an awful business." Like, they're cutting the price every year. Like, you do not want to like this is a, you know, a classic red ocean. It's bloody. You don't want to compete. And so, we were at joint. We were actually competing headto-head with with AWS. So you you were offering uh a public cloud. So we public cloud and then unlike AWS taking the software that we had used to run the public cloud and making it available for people that wanted to run a cloud on prem on their own hardware. So people that would buy Dell or HP or Super Micro, they would buy our software and they would run it on there and get a cloud. So we we ran a public cloud and we knew what the economics of a public cloud were. Namely pretty good. Margins were good. And so what we knew that Amazon that Amazon wasn't volunteering, but what we knew is that AWS S3 was underwriting a war on big box retail. S3 was paying for your prime shipping. It was a genius move. And so also some some insider information that you had because you did your own thing. Well, we know that the margins are very good. And then of course, I mean, we did you will be unsurprised to learn that several of Joy's most prominent customers were retailers. Retailers, this was not lost. Retailers are like, "Gee, I wonder what's happening." Retailers are like, "If you think I'm going to take my dollars and spend them on AWS so AWS can I so Amazon can go to war with me, like no thank you." There was a period of time when I felt like in order to be in the cloud, you have to implement every AWS API. So there's this idea that you had to be API compatible with EC2. There's a company called Eucalyptus that tried to do this. It was just a disaster. And part of the reason it was thought that GCP and Azure could never compete with AWS because they could never be API API compatible.

### Kubernetes的崛起与云中立性

**Brian Caner** 认为，**Jeff Bezos** 是资本主义的“顶级捕食者”。零售商们意识到，如果他们把钱花在 **AWS** 上，就等于资助了 **Amazon** 与自己竞争，因此他们不愿意这样做。在一段时间内，人们认为要进入云计算领域，就必须实现与 **AWS EC2** 的API兼容。但这种尝试（例如 **Eucalyptus** 公司）最终都以失败告终。**Brian** 坚信，2015年 **Kubernetes** 的出现改变了这一切。人们最初被 **Kubernetes** 吸引，是因为他们希望在云服务上获得更多选择，摆脱对 **AWS** 的锁定。他们不需要 **Elastic Beanstalk**、**Green Grass** 或 **Redshift** 等特定服务，只想要基础架构。**Kubernetes** 提供了一个抽象层，实现了真正的**云中立性**（Cloud Neutrality: 允许用户在不同云服务提供商之间自由迁移工作负载和数据，避免厂商锁定）。可以说，在 **Kubernetes** 之前，**多云**（Multi-cloud: 使用多个云服务提供商来部署和管理应用程序）的概念并不真正存在。**Google** 开源 **Kubernetes** 是一个“妙招”，尽管这可能给 **Google** 带来了过多的赞誉。**Kat Cosgrove** 曾表示，**Google** 开源 **Kubernetes** 是为了帮助 **Google Cloud**，因为它提供了一个可移植的容器平台，允许用户从 **Azure** 或 **AWS** 迁移过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so I am convinced that the because what changes what changes in like 2015? What starts in 2015? Kubernetes. And I think that part of that initial attraction to Kubernetes is that people wanted to get some optionality around their cloud and they they felt locked into AWS. They're like, I'm not using all this stuff. I'm not using elastic bean stock. I'm not using green grass. I'm not using kind of these more as I'm not using red shift. What I actually want is this kind of basic infrastructure and kubernetes now gives me this layer upon which I can deploy and get some sort of true cloud neutrality. So multicloud didn't really exist I would say before Kubernetes and I think a lot of that especially early momentum behind Kubernetes is around this idea of like I need to have some optionality in here. I want to have actually be able to go to GCP. So I think you know and I don't I think it's giving Google slightly too much credit but only slightly too much credit to say it is master stroke. On the podcast I had Kat Cosgrove who's uh released a project manager on Kubernetes and you know she's been in the project for a long time and I asked her she's not she was never a Google employee but I asked her why do you think Google open source Kubernetes which you know they have Borg which is amazing and they kind of built honestly a better version for for the for external and they just released it just like that. They put a lot of work in it and to me it didn't really compute like why would Google like what is the business reason and she told me that she thought again speculation from the outsiders. She thought that they probably thought that it would help Google cloud that's right to have the a container which is now portable and now you can give the promise that if you run this on Azure especially AWS you could come over so it kind of makes sense. Is this your thinking? Yeah, absolutely. But I think I think that is definitely the argument that Kubernetes proponents would make inside of Google

### 超大规模数据中心的硬件定制

**Brian Caner** 认为，**Google** 内部支持 **Kubernetes** 的论点是鼓励云中立性，因为 **Google** 可以从中获益。如今，**GCP** 不再是事后才想到的选择，而是一个非常重要的业务，这在很大程度上要归功于 **Kubernetes**。谈到硬件和软件栈的现状，像 **Meta** 和 **Google** 这样的巨头早已不再从 **Dell** 或 **HP** 订购服务器。**Google** 在早期甚至是从 **Frys**（一家现已倒闭的电子产品商店）购买零件自行组装机器。他们最初认为，无论使用什么“垃圾”硬件，只要软件是分布式系统，就没关系，甚至不需要 **ECC内存**（Error-Correcting Code Memory: 具有错误检测和纠正功能的内存）。但他们很快发现，内存数据损坏确实是个问题。因此，这些公司后来开始自行设计和构建适合大规模部署的机器。**Google** 在2000年代中期出版了《**仓库规模的计算机**》（The Warehouse-Size Computer）一书，详细介绍了他们如何设计整个数据中心的电源架构，例如使用 **DC母线**（DC Bus Bar: 直流电源分配系统）。他们从最初的“过于廉价”到后来设计出比传统系统更优秀的工程化系统。**Meta** 和 **Amazon** 也采取了类似的策略，因为现成的解决方案无法满足他们的规模需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

in terms of like why they did it. Nobody prevented it. You know what I mean? It's like they they kind of open sourced it. Google was a pretty cool place in the sense that it was very bottoms up as I understand back then still. Yeah. And and then I think part of their you know it was Craig Mccau who really pushed for the CNCF the formation of the CNCF around Kubernetes to give it kind of a foundation home. I did I do remember one conversation with Craig was that and I were talking early as he's contemplating the CNCF and he's like well I think this is going to allow Kubernetes to get the marketing dollars that it needs. I'm like don't you work for the most profitable company on earth like do you really isn't it just like gushing cash over there and you can't get like you know a couple million bucks for marketing for this thing but no apparently you can't. So, but so I I think that that the the argument that people were making internally was about we should be encouraging cloud neutrality because we are the ones that have something to win and they're right. Um and and they did and GCP is now not an afterthought. GCP is very important. It's a very big business and I think that they've got is Kubernetes to thank solely no but I think it's played an important role for sure. And where are we today in terms of the the hardware and the software stack running specifically thinking of these big clouds what's happening inside the likes of Meta these giants as I understand you know they're no longer just like you know ordering servers from Dell or or wherever never were never what they do they so it it's kind of funny because for all of these folks they took a somewhat similar path they never were because in Google's earliest days they were assembling machines from fries you know rip fries fries being a ical electronic shop that has long since disappeared, but they were kind of famously velcroing machines together and finding so so they bought like the processor, the the different networking switch, whatever. And they had this idea that like it doesn't matter what junk we run on because, you know, our our software is going to run as a distributed system. It actually doesn't matter. We don't need ECC protected memory because it doesn't matter if your DIMs fail. And so it's I think they learned well it does matter a little bit if your DIMs have rampant data corruption. like dims failing that's actually not a problem. Dims your memory returning the wrong thing like that is a problem. You can actually like you turn that like next thing you know like your software inserts that into a row into a database and like yeah now you got yeah that is correctness is a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Correctness is a problem. It's like okay overshot the mark. So by the time they're like okay we're not going to velcro machines together. we're not going. But what by that point in time, you know, the business was established enough that they actually did they built the machines that were fit for scale. So they have a a great book that was written um in the kind of the mid 2000s, the warehouse size computer where they talk about all the things they did DC bus bar really thinking about power across the entire DC. So they kind of they went from from being kind of too cheap for kind of Dell or even Super Micro to then being much better engineered than those systems ever were. So they were never really meaningful customers. Uh and ditto for Facebook Meta. They were they were never really meaningful. I mean they they kicked them out very early and did their own stuff. Brian just talked about how Facebook built their own servers because offtheshelf solutions didn't work at their scale. And what's interesting is that companies like Meta and Google didn't just build better hardware. They also built incredible internal tools. Tools for safe deployments, feature flagging, experimentation, debugging, analytics, the whole stack that lets teams shift fast and with confidence. Most companies never get access to this level of infrastructure. You either build it yourself, which takes years, and large engineering teams, or you make with scattered tools that don't talk to each other. That's exactly where Static comes in. Static is our presenting partner for the season, and they give every engineering team access to the kind of tooling that only the biggest tech companies used to have internally. At its core, static is a toolkit for safer deployments and experimentation. You ship a new feature to 10% of users behind a feature gate. You validate that it behaves correctly, wash the metrics, and expand to remaining 90% only when you're confident. And if something goes wrong, you can turn it off instantly, long before it affects everyone. And safe deployments require visibility. Static includes analytics, both product analytics and infrastructure analytics. So you can actually see what your code is doing in production, errors, performance changes, funnels, user behavior, because you cannot ship safely if you can't see what's happening. Companies like Microsoft and notion run hundreds of experiments per quarter were statig velocity that used to require entire platform teams to build and maintain. This used to be infrastructure available to maybe 10 or 15 tech giants. Now startups and mid-size teams use static to ship quickly without breaking things. If you want to give your engineering team world-class tooling from day one, go to statsic.com/pragmatic, there's a generous freeze tier, a $50,000 starter program and affordable enterprise plans. And now let's get back to the conversation about the history of computing and what might be coming next.

### Oxide的诞生：自建云硬件的愿景

**Google**、**Meta**、**Microsoft** 和 **Amazon** 都独立得出结论：他们需要自行构建硬件，因为 **Super Micro**、**Dell** 和 **HP** 等传统供应商的产品无法满足他们超大规模的运行需求。这些传统产品是为小型服务器机房设计的，而不是为数千台服务器的公共云业务设计的。在最基本的层面，传统服务器的设计更像是个人电脑的堆叠，而非为大规模基础设施运行而优化。与此同时，**Joyent** 在2016年被 **Samsung** 收购，因为 **Samsung** 的云账单高得惊人，他们需要将云基础设施“内化”。这让 **Oxide** 团队意识到，市场上缺乏能够满足下一代 **Samsung** 这样规模公司需求的产品。因此，在2019年，**Oxide** 成立时坚信：首先，云计算是所有计算的未来，弹性、API驱动的基础设施是现代化的标志。其次，这种基础设施不应只能租用，而应该可以购买、拥有并在自己的数据中心运行。企业可能出于风险管理、安全性或经济原因选择自建，因为达到一定规模后，拥有比租用更划算。

<summary>Original English</summary>

And and this was independent. So like both Google and Meta both came to the conclusion of like we should just build our own stuff and and Microsoft and and Amazon all came to the independent conclusion because the scale at which they needed to run was not at all the scale at which Super Micro and Dell and HP were geared. What they were geared to do was to run the servers in your server room where you needed to know the devs, right? Where it's like I'm going to have a little rack. It's going to have six servers. Then maybe it's got 12 servers. Okay, maybe we grow to 24 servers. That's what they were designed to do. If you're like, "No, I want to buy servers by the thousands because I've got a public cloud business." Like, if you want to buy servers by the thousands, there is no product from those companies for you. And in very, very basic ways, well, like the DC bus bar at every juncture, they've been designed to be a personal computer that you happen to be slapping many personal computers together, but they're not designed to actually run infrastructure at scale. So, and that was happening inside effectively all the hyperscalers. And Joint, meanwhile, was bought by Samsung in 2016. Joint was bought by Samsung because their cloud bill was off the charts and they bought they bought you to bring it in house. Yeah. And and there was not a product they could go buy. So they went to go buy a company. So you're like, "Wow." And it's like, "Wow, that's a big AWS bill." It's like, yes, very big AWS bill. But then that was not a product that or company that was available for for you know the next S. What does the next Samsung do? like well that's one less company available to buy. Um so when we were contemplating the next thing in 2019 one of the things that we had seen is that and we felt we earnestly believe that one cloud computing is the future of all computing not a deep thought that elastic infrastructure APIdriven infrastructure that is modernity one two you shouldn't be able to only rent that you should be able to buy that own it run it in your own data center why would you want to do that well you might want to do that for risk management for security or for economics because it, you know, if you're at a certain scale, you'd rather own it than rent it.

### Oxide的硬件设计挑战：从电源到网络

在 **Oxide** 成立之前，中型公司如果想自建云，通常只能购买 **HP** 或 **Dell** 的现成服务器，像 **Basecamp** 那样租用数据中心空间，然后自行组装。**Oxide** 的目标是为更大规模的企业提供更优的自建云解决方案。**Brian Caner** 解释了构建 **Oxide** 计算机的复杂性。他们从一张白纸开始设计，而非基于现有PC生态系统的技术债务进行迭代。例如，在电源方面，传统服务器每个机箱都有独立的交流电源，这意味着16台服务器需要32个电源和风扇，这些风扇是主要的磨损部件和噪音源。而 **Oxide** 采用了更高效的 **AC母线**（AC Bus Bar: 交流电源分配系统）和电源架，将交流电整流为直流电，然后通过直流母线进行供电。此外，**Oxide** 还实现了**盲插网络**（Blind Mating Networking: 一种硬件设计，服务器或计算模块在插入机架时，网络连接会自动完成，无需手动插拔网线），这意味着系统中完全没有可见的网线。当服务器模块插入时，它会盲插到预先布线的背板上。这消除了布线错误，并简化了部署。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And I think, you know, before Oxide or like in 2019 or even in like, you know, 2020, 2021, if you were like a midsize company, you know, like not big enough to build out your own custom cloud and build everything that the hyperscalers did, you could like buy some off-the-shelf like HP or Dell, like a bunch of them. I think that's what Base Camp did. I I think they posted that they they bought a bunch of bunch of these things. They rented a space in a in a one of these shared or or or I think two different locations. They put in their boxes with all the memory and then you know they kind of set it up and and put it together. So I guess those were the two options, right? Yeah, those are the two options and I think that you know base camp ended up being a real poster child for the economic advantage because I mean DHH know obviously outspoken and uh the economic advantage was really really really clear. They're also at a scale which is like not the scale that we're targeting, right? That the scale we're looking at is a much larger scale. And so the economic argument is actually even more compelling when you're at that larger scale. I love it when you know the VCs that passed on us because they felt there was no market then would send me like the DHH blog post. It's like why are you sending this to me? I should be sending this to you. Like I know this. We just knew the economics of it and we knew couldn't predict exactly what the trends would look like but but believed that there would be folks that were born on the public cloud that would outgrow the economics of the public cloud and want to go on prem. Economics aside, what does it take to build one of these things? And I I I saw one of these things. We we'll put in a picture of it. It's like a proper like, you know, like my my 9 ft tall rack. It's it's big. It's it it feels like you're putting like I don't know like 16 or 32 of those of those like you know Dell things in terms of size just to get sense. Yeah. Yeah. We would 32 comput sleds in there. That's right. And and what does it take what did it take to actually build it? What did you need to design in terms of hardware and then software? Yeah. So well and we knew this too that going into the company we knew we were taking a clean sheet of paper right and so we were deliberately like no we're going to start with a problem. We're not going to build it out of Dell HB micro. you're going to start with a problem and how do you best solve the problem? And as it turns out, like there were a whole bunch of there's a lot of technical debt that had been accured by this kind of PC ecosystem. So I mean, you know, God, where do you start? Uh just on the environmentals like on power, right? The fact that you got AC power in each of these Dell HP super micro. Yeah. So if you like put 16, you have like 16 separate AC times two because you have two power supplies per one U two chassis. Two power supplies. By the way, there are two fans sitting on those power supplies and those and those fans are actually what wear out if you go to the like in terms of like the worring fans. It's not just coming from the computer, it's coming from the power supplies because those power supplies are dense. They're packed with stuff. So, they've got to overcome a huge amount of static pressure. So, like that's not the way anyone does it at scale. The way people do it at scale is you've got AC bus bar, you've got a a power shelf that is that is much more efficient and that that that that rectifies from AC to DC and then you run DC up and down and then you you blind made into that. So we knew we were going to do that. That's a little electronics engineering right there. Yeah. Yeah. That Yeah. The power engineering for sure and we knew we were going to do that. We also knew that by taking a clean sheet of paper that we would have opportunity made available to us that we weren't necessarily thinking of and that manifested pretty early. So we blind mate into power which is to say that when you feed a sled in that power connector you don't see it it's at the back you you lock the sled in blind mates into power and we had assumed that we were going to do what Facebook and Google and others have done Amazon done and had networking out the front in the cold aisle but as we were you know taking a clean sheet of paper talking to some connectivity vendors they asked us like why are you wait a minute you guys are like taking a clean sheet of paper why are you putting cabling in the front like why wouldn't you also blind mate in the network and the networking connection and we were like can you do that? They're like oh you can definitely do that like well why don't the hyperscalers do that? It's like, oh, they would all tell you that if they could start over today, they would blind me the networking and they're just too afraid to do it at this point, which is like, I mean, that was like catnip for us, you know, like they're too afraid to do it. Like, okay, we got to And one of the very early holy god, we're going to bet the company decisions was blindmating networking because if blindmating networking doesn't work, you've got nothing. You don't have a problem.

### 自研交换机与系统复杂性

**Oxide** 的盲插网络意味着系统中没有可见的网线，所有布线都在工厂完成，运行在背板内部。这与 **Google** 数据中心那种整齐但布满可见网线的景象形成对比。盲插网络消除了布线错误，并且每台计算机需要连接到至少三个网络：电源检测网络、服务处理器网络和高速数据网络。由于没有布线，也就没有误插的可能，大大降低了复杂性。**Oxide** 甚至决定自行设计和制造**交换机**（Switch: 一种网络设备，用于在计算机网络中转发数据帧），这在融资初期并未引起 **Sand Hill Road**（硅谷风险投资公司聚集地）投资人的关注。然而，**Brian Caner** 认为，自研交换机是公司能否成功的关键，否则将面临第三方集成噩梦。他们的目标是让客户只需插入电源和网络，即可开箱即用，将操作员的介入降到最低。传统上，交换机被认为是简单的组件，但 **Brian** 强调并非如此。市场上实际的交换芯片供应商非常少，主要是 **Broadcom**。但 **Oxide** 发现并使用了 **Intel Tofino** 芯片，它提供了真正的**可编程网络**（Programmable Networking: 允许通过软件定义和控制网络行为，而非依赖固定硬件），这对于 **Oxide** 至关重要，而 **Broadcom** 无法提供这种灵活性。

And and so what is the difference in blinding networking versus It means there is no cabling in the system at all. So when you've got a a sled, you are blind mating into a cabled back plane. So that the it's cabled in the factory. So the the the operator So when the box comes in, that's why I didn't see any cables. It's it's inside. It runs inside. It runs down the back. And so versus when I look at the pictures of a data center of let's say Google, you you see they're very neatly organized. It's like I love organization. So it's like beautiful, but it's cables everywhere and you can see. So you don't have that. We don't have that. And in particular, so because there's no cabling, there's also no miscelling, right? So, so every computer is not actually on just one network. It actually needs to be on three. It's on a power detect a presence detect network. It is on a service man a service processor network. And then it's on that high-speed network that you really care about like the actual network. In any facility, you you need another network for power environmentals and so on. It's very easy to have miscellane that's got to go to a different router. It's like you there's a bunch of of just complexity that we eliminate because we do and then part of that decision came out of an an arguably earlier bet the company decision which was we did our own switch. So we also did in addition to doing our own comput sled we did our own switch and last time you told me about this and in our deep dive we did a little bit that like at first you said we did our own switch and I was like yeah okay cool you did your own switch and then you told me that actually like that is a second computer to build. Can you can you tell me why? And it's funny because we went when we went through Sand Hill initially raising money for the company, nobody asked us. Sand Hill roll. Exactly. And we were definitely so people be like, I've got a technical question for you and you're like, oh god, here comes switch. It's the switch question. But then be no some other random asked questions like all right, that's not a very good question. But nobody was asking us about the switch. And we were concerned about the switch because we'd already come to the conclusion in order to make this thing really work, we had to do our own switch. And the reason you have to do our own switch, if we didn't do our own switch, it would be a third-party integration nightmare and we wouldn't be able to actually solve the problem that we're trying to solve, which is when this thing shows up in your data center, we want this thing to to to come out of the crate. We want you to wheel it up. We want you to put in power and networking and go. We do not want you to have to to cable anything. It should be the the the level of operator involvement should be really minimal. So, we'd already come to the conclusion that in order to make this thing operable and manageable, we need to do our own switch. And so you're saying that like buying cuz a switch to me sounds like a somewhat simple component and you're you're going to tell me why it's not.

### 计算机设计的复杂性与Oxide的独特团队

**Intel Tofino** 芯片的可编程性对 **Oxide** 至关重要，尽管 **Intel** 后来停产了这款芯片，但 **Oxide** 幸运地采购了足够的库存以支持未来产品。自研交换机带来了许多意想不到的好处，使得公司无法想象没有它的运作。构建一台计算机远比想象中复杂。由于高速信号传输（如 **DDR5** 内存和 **PCIe**），信号完整性成为一个巨大挑战。电路板本质上是模拟的，数字只是我们自我欺骗的简化。微处理器需要复杂的电源时序管理，以及一个管理电源分配网络、环境参数和与内存、I/O连接的**环绕芯片**（Surround Chip: 辅助处理器管理电源、I/O和环境的芯片）。这种复杂性导致大多数公司倾向于使用**参考设计**（Reference Design: 芯片制造商提供的经过验证的电路设计，供客户直接采用或修改），而非从零开始创新。**Oxide** 团队则选择从白纸开始设计，这需要无畏的电子工程师。他们没有从 **Dell** 或 **HPE** 招聘工程师，而是从 **GE Medical** 等公司寻找，这些工程师习惯于设计 **CT系统**（CT Systems: 计算机断层扫描系统），拥有从第一性原理解决问题的能力，而不是依赖供应商提供的参考设计。

Oh yeah, it's definitely not. No, but that but that attitude is very important. If you want to go build your own switch, I encourage you to have that attitude as long as you possibly can because otherwise you won't go do it. So So what does your switch what is switch being obviously the networking switch? What is your networking switch do or or that made it so important for you to build it as opposed to like going to one of the many suppliers and saying, you know, let's get your not many suppliers. Oh, so if you actually go to the actual switching silicon is coming from like it was like one and a half providers. Oh, it's all Broadcom and so what you're actually talking about is Broadcom silicon. Um what we discovered is is this actually interesting piece of actually Intel silicon from a company they had bought called Barefoot and we found Intel Tofino which allowed us to have true programmable networking. So we we use Intel Tofino. Intel later killed Tofino. So complicated relationship with Intel over this. uh we fortunately have procured enough to fino to be able to take we bought ourselves the time we need to kind of design our nextg switch but that programmability was very very important for us um and that we were not going to get from Broadcom is a very proprietary company we were not going to get a bunch of the things that we needed in building that switch we were not going to get out of Broadcom so it was ended up being very important we were concerned I mean again another one of these kind of bet the company decisions very very concerned about about having our own switch integrating our own And what we found is that was a that was a win in so many dimensions. So many dimensions that we did not anticipate. And as now you can't imagine the company without having to sometimes do stuff and you might get some wins. that I absolutely well I think also like whenever you're deliberating something big like that you it the fact that it is big kind of forces you to really deliberate and then once you commit to it to taking that big risk you often see unexpected dividends like well as long as we're going to do this as long as we are taking a clean sheet of paper as long as we're doing our own switch we can blindate the networking if we were not doing our own switch we really couldn't blind make the networking we really needed to be able to own both sides of that in order to be able to do our own switch or blind a lot of us you know listeners, viewers are software engineers, so we don't know as much about hardware. Obviously, we know we we know how the things work, but can you tell me a bit on what it actually means to design or build a computer? Cuz you know, I I'll give you the the novice approach, which is obviously going to be wrong. But the novice approach is like, oh, here's a here's a processor, here's a few chips, here's a mainboard, I'll just put it on there and I'm done. But when I was in your lab at Oxide, uh you told me that one of the first engineers turned out to be a radio frequency engineer. You told me how this is great because of the all the FDA approvals and all these things and I was like okay this is way more involved than I ever imagined. Yeah, it's very involved. How do you build a new computer? First of all, it's all I mean it would be a lot easier if it were all slower, right? The problem is it's very fast. It's high speed. So the connection to memory via now DDR5 double data area memory 5 is ridiculously high throughput is very from a signal integrity perspective really complicated. These boards by the way ultimately this is all analog. We think of it as digital and it is digital but digital is like a lie that that doubles allow us to tell ourselves. It is actually like you are talking about signals that are racing through a a substrate and the and with a PCIe or DDR5 the all of so those signals are very complicated to lay out that's complicated the actual like how does the computer start like this computer is like it's like a it's like a a trip 7 right or you know I a 747 used to be my favorite jet to kind of pick on but now the 747 is retired so I got to pick something else and I'm not going to pick another boring aircraft I don't think I an A380 I guess, right? I should pick an air bus. But you think about like the okay, an Airbus doesn't just like come by itself like it needs an airport. It needs like a runway. It needs it needs all the infrastructure to feed it. Well, so too for a microprocessor, it it doesn't like just the power sequencing for those things is very complicated. It needs another surround that manages the power distribution network that actually manages its power on sequencing that manages all of its environmentals that manage its connection to memory to IO. So it is it is just fractally complicated uh to the point that people often just take reference designs and iterate on them. They don't actually really innovate on this stuff because it's it takes so long. And you told me this was really interesting last time that uh as I understand reference design means correct me if I'm wrong that you're an electronics engineer or or hardware engineer and you want to build a new hardware and you take an existing reference that has been tested measure it out like it doesn't create accidental like all sorts of radio frequency things and then you implement that. But you told me that this is not what you did. You also told me that it's pretty hard to find electronics engineers who are used to not doing reference design but who are brave enough to like who are brave. Yes. I would say that in in in computer design in particular, the high-speed designs are so hard. People got very accustomed to taking the reference designs and it was harder to find folks that were willing to take a clean sheet of paper and we we ultimately found them. I mean, and we've got a a double E team that is extraordinary and double E is electronics engineer, right? And yeah, and absolutely fearless. Um, and in part because like they're actually but they didn't spend their careers at Dell and HPE. Like they're coming No, they're like coming from like GE medical where they worked on CT systems.

### Oxide的透明薪酬与独特文化

**Brian Caner** 解释说，**Oxide** 招聘工程师时，发现那些习惯于传统硬件公司（如 **Dell**）的工程师，往往缺乏从第一性原理解决问题的能力，而是依赖于**现场应用工程师**（Field Applications Engineer: 芯片或组件供应商的技术支持人员，帮助客户集成产品）提供的设计。这导致 **Oxide** 在寻找合适人才时遇到了困难。为了吸引顶尖人才，**Oxide** 在2021年3月发布了一篇博客文章，公开了其**透明且统一的薪酬体系**。所有员工，无论职位，都获得相同的基本工资（当时约为20万美元）。这种做法吸引了那些被公司价值观和原则深深吸引的工程师。例如，他们拥有业内最优秀的**支持工程师**（Support Engineers），因为高薪吸引了许多热爱支持工作但传统职业路径会迫使他们转向其他领域的软件工程师。这些支持工程师甚至能够修复代码或编写工具，极大地提升了团队效率和客户满意度。这种文化让员工感到自己的工作被高度重视，并能回归到自己真正热爱的事业。

Wow. H how did that happen? Uh how did they come to Oxide? It's it's it's not but it feels like such a different field. I would have assumed naively that you know if you're building a computer you'll you'll try to get electronics engineers who have built computers you would think. Um and then we and that was probably our thought as well and then we discovered that we were not getting along with those engineers. Well, we didn't hire them because we were but we were just like finding like there's a lot of friction because there wasn't a real first principles approach from those folks. And this is where you get to especially you get to talk to folks that like been at Dell for a generation and like for any design they're used to calling what's called the FAE which is the the the the field applications engineer for you know the for the voltage regulator. It's like well the FAE gives me the design. It's like all right well how do you know that it's the right design? Well no he there. So it's like all right so like let's go hire that person then let's forget you. And we were really just we were struggling. I was struggling to get outside of my own personal network to find um the right engineers. Um and we were kind of brainstorming like how can we um get people to see the company who wouldn't otherwise see it and specifically for hardware engineers like we're talking about. Yeah. And just in general, but forecally Yeah. For doubles it was feeling especially acute. One of the thing you we're kind of brainstorming as a team and uh you know one of our engineers said you know I you know the values are very important to us at Oxide which they are and I relay Oxide's values and our principles to people outside of Oxide and they're like that's just and I explain that like you know normally I would agree with you but uh it's when I get to the compensation people that their heads turn because our compensation is transparent and uniform and people are like, "Wait, what?" And I'm like, "I could write a blog entry on it." Like, "Yeah, that'd be like that would be great." I'm like, "Okay." And so, up until that point, we had not talked about it at all. We had not talked about it publicly at all. I just came up with the idea that like compensation is just private. It's just not something you talk about with people, you know, and you go to levels FYI or some of or some of the forums you're like anonymously asking, people are enemies sharing that. That's how you get information. That's how you get information. And so I kind of had this idea that it was that it just is not something that you and so we wrote this blog entry in March of 2021 and it sent our hiring nonlinear and it wasn't that people were like oh my god I want to work for a company where everyone's paid the same like that is like that's like yeah cuz your composition was both the same and you also put the number specifically I think it was something like $200,000 back then. Uh uh yeah with it was a little bit less back then but in a bit more than that yeah I the uh now we just got another raise so now I've lost track. It was 207 but now it's more than that. I actually don't know because the one thing is when compensation is uniform like you don't keep total track of like oh did like literally people were like wait a minute like I got there's an error in my paycheck I just got paid more. People like, "No, no, we got a raise." Like, "When was that?" Like, "No, it was at the last all hands." Like, "Oh, you know, I did have to go to the bathroom like at the end of last all all hands. I didn't listen to the recording. I guess I missed my raise." Like, "Yeah, yeah, you got to pay attention around here." But it was more that what what drew attention was that people engineers in particular were but just in general, people drawn to a company that would be so nuts as to do that. And it did it ultimately like that engineer that made the suggestion was absolutely right. It was the compensation that convinced people that we take our values really seriously, that we're a really principled company, which is you're paying everyone the same base salary. Exactly the same. Yeah. They're making the same as as you the the electronics engineer, software engineer, the whatever other role you might have.

### Oxide的软件栈与分布式系统更新

**Oxide** 的软件栈也同样令人兴奋。在服务处理器层面，他们从零开始用 **Rust** 语言构建了自己的操作系统，命名为 **Hubris**（傲慢），而其调试器则名为 **Humility**（谦逊）。整个软件栈都是开源的。对于主机CPU，**Oxide** 决定在产品中构建自己的**虚拟机管理程序**（Hypervisor: 一种软件，用于创建和运行虚拟机）和**控制平面**（Control Plane: 负责管理和协调分布式系统中所有组件的软件层）。控制平面负责实例的配置、虚拟存储的分配等决策，就像 **AWS** 一样，但界面设计更优美。**Oxide** 交付了从服务处理器到主机CPU操作系统，再到分布式系统（名为 **Omicron**，在新冠变种出现前命名）的所有软件。这个分布式系统非常复杂，不仅要健壮地配置实例，还要能够可靠地更新整个系统。在公共云中，更新通常涉及人工操作和运行手册，但在 **Oxide** 的**气隙**（Air Gap: 物理隔离的网络，通常用于高安全性环境）环境中，无法进行人工干预。因此，他们需要一个完全自动化的更新机制。

That's right. And when and and and I um I don't know if uh you should just go ahead and say it if you want to, but many people are like, would you pay support engineers the same amount? It's like why do people always like pick on support? They they would ask exactly uh answer to that is yes and the answer to that is uh if you do that you find supportive support engineers and so we have got uh I think we've got the best support engineers in the business. I think it's we we've got really really phenomenal folks in support. I I I heard I heard a small company called Gumroad do this where where they they they paid their support staff really high again about same as software engineers and then they got support staff who were software engineers and they could fix the code or like write tools for themselves and you get people for whom because I mean you know there's a a certain thrill in being in a in support that because you've got someone with a problem. It's technical. You get to come up you get to be technical. get to go solve a hard problem and then immediately the you get such gratitude you know and like that's a rush and if there are people that are really drawn to that like I love helping other people I love that feeling that I get when I resolve a problem for someone that immediiacy so one of the things that we we've heard repeatedly from from several of our support engineers is my heart was always in support but but my career path was forcing me into a different career path and I love the fact that and get back to where my heart is. Yeah, that that that's nice because now like it Yeah, you're not going to make more by doing something that you're not as into. I I love that. So, going back to where we were, which is like you build the hardware, you build this like really complicated piece and you went through electronics engineering, putting it together. Let's put a software cuz that that's super exciting. What what what does it take to build software for this? Did you start from sc let's talk from from the low level. Did you start from scratch from operating system? Did you have to or could you use and and there's kind of different answers at different levels of the stack. So on our service processor we did start from scratch. We did our own denovo operating system um in Rust appropriately called hubris because we had the hubris to do it. Um the the debugger by the way for hubris is called humility feels like appropriate for a debugger. So that was was denovo and this is open source right open source. Yeah open source the entire stack is open source. Everything we've done is open source. We can go on GitHub and check it you know, go on GitHub and check it out. And yeah, I mean, we've got God's own revenue model because like you're like, well, what if somebody like can download it, run it on a different computer. It's like knock yourself out because, you know, we we think the best way to run this is on on the machines that we make and those are not free. An oxide machine is not, you know, that's not free downloadable, but all open source. So, um that was for the service processor. Um for the host CPU, we really had it kind of at a quandry like what do we want to do in the host CPU? And uh with that is say like on the actual like what was then AMD Milan now AMD Turin silicon we knew that we wanted to do in the product we would do our own hypervisor and our own control plane. It was very so this is not something that you run the control plane is is that controlling multiple like like the whole like you have a bunch of processors and memory and all that and control plane controls all that. You plug this thing on, you power it on, you put in networking. What you get is a console that looks a lot like a what would like look like AWS if AWS looked better. I mean it's it's a console. I mean not to I mean look not to disparage AWS but like we know that like design is not really the strong suit. We agree with that. Yeah. Exactly. So it looks gorgeous. Uh of course um but it's and it's also got you got your API you've got your CLI and you're provisioning instances. Where are those provision instances provisioned? It's the control plane that makes those decisions. You are attaching virtual storage those instances. Where does that storage live? It's the control plane that makes that decision. So just like with AWS, you don't need to know that stuff. That is that's just happening. You you you're using Terraform to spin up your cluster. You're you're running Kubernetes on it. You're knocking yourself out. So I we are delivering all of the software from that lowest layer that service processor what the operating system that's running on the host CPU and then that distributed system very importantly that distributed system um which we called omocron before the omocron variant of co which was feeling very like illtimed for a very brief period of time it was feeling illtimed and now I feel like the omocrron variant of of co is just like has just forgotten and now it's a good name again so it's like you know we just it was a really short list it short live. Yeah. So we so so you know we we we lived longer than the omocrron variant of co co and that is our our control plane. Um and um that is a very sophisticated body of software. um in addition to cuz it's it's not enough to just like provision an instance right you need to and you need to do that robustly you need to do that via API CI and so on but then you all the software that does that and keeps track of your instance so on uh it's very important that you can actually update that software that whole distributed system you need to be able to update to a new version of the software and this gets really thorny right because in in a in a public cloud you do that with a runbook, right? I mean, even the, you know, we don't feature it prominently, but even in GCP and AWS, yes, there's a lot of automation, but there's also also humans involved, and there are humans that are taking the responsibility for for actually updating software. For sure. Really? Yeah. I mean, again, for the most part.

### 分布式系统更新的复杂性

**Brian Caner** 解释了分布式系统更新的巨大挑战。在 **Oxide** 的气隙环境中，如果更新出错，没有人能到现场进行修复。因此，他们需要一个极其健壮的更新机制。他们首先实现了**最小可行更新**（Minimum Viable Update: 能够完成基本更新功能，即使过程可能不完美或需要停机），这意味着在更新期间，整个机架需要下线，更新完成后再重新上线。虽然这实现了更新功能，但对于一个24/7运行的云系统来说，理想情况是实例在更新期间仍能保持在线。这个功能仍在开发中，由工程师 **Dave Pacico** 领导。分布式系统更新之所以复杂，是因为它不仅仅是替换一个二进制文件。它需要更新**服务处理器**（Service Processor: 负责监控和管理服务器硬件的独立处理器）、**信任根**（Root of Trust: 系统中第一个被信任的组件，用于验证后续组件的完整性）、驱动固件、主机操作系统以及所有相互通信的组件。在更新过程中，系统会处于新旧版本混合的**混合状态**（Hybrid State: 系统中同时存在新旧版本组件的状态），这带来了数据库模式变更、组件兼容性等诸多复杂问题。**Oxide** 团队通过建立坚实的基础，并逐步自动化更新过程，最终成功实现了这一目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of automation involved, but in particular, if something goes wrong in an update, you know, you've got DevOps that can can hop in and figure out what's going on and and get it rectified. We are shipping a distributed system across an air gap in an oxide rack that's potentially running in a secure facility. We cannot be there if it goes wrong. So, we need when when especially because a lot of your customers are buying it because they want to do it themselves. They want to do themselves. So in many ways the thorniest software problem for us we had actually several thorny problems couldn't pick between them because they're all thorny for different reasons. One of the very very thorny problems was how do we ship a distributed system that we can then update and one of the things we did that was important was like okay because it's very easy to paint a road map that is very complicated for update. You'll never ship anything. So what we needed to ship in that first product that we shipped when you were back in Emeryville 2 years ago, we needed the minimum viable update. We needed an update where the software could be updated even if it was painful. So what we did is we have this thing called mupdate which is the minimum update and mupdate in particular required the control plane to be parked. So we're going to take this rack that's running instances, take it offline, we're going to update it and then bring it back online. And that was robust. It was great and we got that working. That's great. That is great and that you can update it. But that's actually not what you want in a cloud, right? You're like, I sorry, I'm like using this thing 247. Like I actually I I I want to these instances need to remain up while I update it. But that gave us the platform to go build that update functionality into the software. Extraordinarily sophisticated um and really an extraordinary body of work. And actually just recently um we had at our internal meetup the engineer who led the charge on that Dave Pacico gave a presentation on looking back of two years of update. And I I got to tell you, I think this is one of the best single talks on software you'll ever say. And we we will link this, but can you give me just a short overview of like why this update is so difficult because like some listeners will will be used to just building applications for example on the iPhone and an update there it what it means obviously I know this is way more complicated but an update is there's a new binary version and it replaces the old binary version. Now, of of course, you know, you're saying this is an operating system update or or you know, like with a car and of course you might think like, well, you know, you could just replace the old version with the new version and there's some downtime, but where is the complexity that actually like puts all this thorn? Because I'm sensing this is like I am missing something something very obvious.

### AI工具在Oxide的实际应用与局限

**Brian Caner** 谈到AI工具在 **Oxide** 的应用。他认为，AI工具在软件工程的许多方面带来了巨大转变，但也有人对其持简化主义甚至悲观态度。**Oxide** 的工程师们广泛使用AI工具进行实验。例如，他们利用AI处理繁琐任务，生成测试用例，以及最重要的，进行文档理解。**Oxide** 拥有强大的**写作密集型文化**（Writing-Intensive Culture: 强调通过书面文档进行沟通、决策和知识共享的公司文化），因此 **大语言模型**（Large Language Model: 基于海量文本训练的 AI 系统）在消费和理解这些文档方面表现出色，例如生成技术术语表。**Brian** 曾尝试手动创建 **RFD**（Request for Discussion: 一种技术讨论请求文档）词汇表，但发现其复杂性超出了预期，而 **LLM** 能够轻松完成。他将 **LLM** 视为一个强大的工具，但在某些领域，特别是硬件工程中，其价值非常有限。他曾做过一个名为“智能不足”的演讲，强调在构建 **Oxide** 机架时遇到的许多问题，是 **LLM** 无法提供任何帮助的。

So, because it's a distributed system, when you've got an app on an iPhone, it's not a distributed system. Oh, and distributed system, meaning that you've got a bunch of different nodes, components that are going to speak to one another. And it's like those might need updating as well. Oh, they definitely need updating. Oh, they all need update. Yeah, the whole thing needs to be updated. You got to be able to update all of the software in the rack. Oh, this is not just operating updating the operating system. This is updating absolutely everything. So, you might need to update some parts or all parts. You need to update the service processor, the root of trust, the drive firmware, the host operating system, and then all of the components that speak to one another. Okay. And then it's like okay so I mean this is challenge is fractally complicated. I mean one of the very basic ways it's complicated is like so when we're updating we are moving the system from from one version to another version in between it's going to kind of be in both versions. Like what does that mean to have the system that's operable while you've got some new components and some old components? What if you change your database schema from one version to the next version which we definitely have. Like you have to have a a a method of doing that. What if you and for for every one of these components, how is it updatable? How we got to reason about the system when it's in this hybrid state and then it needs to be done in a way that's very very robust. So the first and foremost we had to to develop the foundation that allowed us to do this absolutely robustly. And so the way Dave and team did this is you know with that foundation and then very slowly lighting up different aspects of the system and making it more and more automatic over time and you know first started running that on what we call our dog food rack and did our first automatic update on the dog food rack. Uh it was a really great feeling for that team because this has been a very long software road and it has been one that has been very deliberate. Um and and ultimately like and you know full credit to Dave and team took us about the amount of time that we thought it would which is kind of very rare for software because I think software so practically complicated but that's only because they've been very carefully managing scope versus schedule making and because quality has got to be the constraint and Dave's talk goes into that in detail in a way that I think is just extraordinary. So I I'd like to talk about the topic that is, you know, a lot of people's mind is is AI specifically and and AI tools. Yeah. How have AI tools changed how you're working at Oxide specifically? Think about software engineering, maybe maybe even hardware. Are are you using these tools? Are you experimenting with them? For sure. When we've been early on in terms of of using them and Yeah. I mean, you use them for different for a different and people are using them in different ways. I mean I I I no part of the oxide stack is vibe coded. I think that that is the that that is safe to say but we are using it and we're using it to and again different people are using it different ways. We are you know using it to do things that are tedious. We're using it to do generate test cases you know generate the I use it for because I think the thing that is just like unmatched at is just document comprehension. We've got a very writing intensive culture. We've got a lot of documents. It is great. You always had that. Yeah. always had that and if you've got a writing intensive culture like your LLM ready not to generate those documents but to to consume them and to you know one of the things that I've always wanted to do and it's still like now is possible I I haven't quite found the time to do it early on I wanted to make an RFD glossery so RFD are a request for discussion we've got a lot of technical terms I wanted to make a glossery I tried to do that for like 3 hours this is like in 2020 and I'm like this would This spreads to the horizon. This is so just making a glossery is so complicated. A glossery is something that an LLM could just turn out and the so there are lots of things that we are we're doing to to use LLMs in particular is clearly a very real very very big shift in lots of different aspects of software engineering. I I think that it you know but of course there are people that are being kind of reductive about it. I am definitely not a doomer. There are a lot of doomers that are out there and you know I tried to give this talk about building the oxide itself the oxide rack and in particular the problems that we had along the way that an LLM was never going to be of any assistance on. And so and I I the title of the talk was intelligence is not enough and one of the prominent doomers actually did a reaction video to my talk. It's like the only time I've ever had someone and my daughter who was then like 11 was just like thought it was hilarious that someone had held their own time in such low regard that they would spend it recording a reaction video to my talk. And so she was like we I want to watch this. I'm like oh god I do not want to watch this again. Ultimately, the thing that was really frustrating is this person obviously disagrees with what I was saying, but then when I was giving these very concrete examples of here are the specific technical problems that required more than intelligence to resolve that an LLM was not going to be able to resolve. He literally fast forwarded through those parts. He's like, we just don't need this. This is like this is just you're like, bro, this is the talk. Like you you can't do this. Like you're fast forwarding over the actual like meat of the talk. C can you give an example of like a problem which which you felt was this like even you know if if we fast forward to like the arbitrary future.

### 硬件调试的“绝望”时刻

**Brian Caner** 举了一个硬件调试的例子，说明 **LLM** 在这方面的无能为力。在首次启动 **Oxide** 机器时，CPU无法脱离复位状态，每隔1.25秒就会自行复位。团队排除了电源网络问题，**AMD** 也确认电源参数非常理想。经过数周的努力和绝望，一位工程师深入研究了CPU与**电压调节器**（Voltage Regulator: 负责为CPU提供稳定电压的组件）之间的协议，发现调节器没有发送**确认包**（Acknowledgement Packet: 在通信协议中，用于确认数据已成功接收的信号）。CPU要求电压设置为0.9伏，但从未收到确认，因此不断复位。问题最终被定位为 **Renesas** 控制器上的固件错误。在获得 **Renesas** 的固件更新后，问题得以解决。**Brian** 强调，构建电路板不仅仅是智力测试，还需要团队协作和解决问题的韧性。在绝望时刻，团队成员会尝试各种方法，而不同的视角和方法论至关重要。他提到，**Flask** 的创建者 **Armin Ronacher** 正在用AI实习生进行原型开发，但也表示需要招聘真人，因为人能带来能量，这是公司生存和发展所必需的。

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah super simple. I mean like like the I mean we've had many many scary problems but um we had a uh the CPU when we did our first bring up of our first machine. And then what does a bring up mean? A bring up means taking a board and powering it up and trying to get it to work for the first time. I think you mentioned that the term smoke test comes from electronics engineers. Oh, I they I mean a smoke test I always think of a smoke test more from from aerodynamic but but yes I mean aeronautical engineers but yes I mean that you're definitely like smoke is definitely a possibility that's a very bad you do not want smoke that is bad but no smoke please in bring up so so the bring up but we are doing bring up and we are unable to get the CPU out of reset and after 1.25 25 seconds the CPU would resets itself. What's going on? Is the power network bad? We're doing all and like when you have something like that happen, it's like well what's happening? It's like I mean it's it's just not working. I mean like what do you tell your LLM to be like it it like it's not working. I mean and they can maybe give you some suggestions but in this case it wouldn't. So we are going deep into this understanding like are maybe the power network is like marginal. No no no we resolve that. No, no. We're We've got a and actually we're working with AMD at the time and AMD's like, "No, these power numbers are amazing. Like your margin is very good." You're measuring it out. You're like eliminating that one. We're eliminating that one. You're going through eliminating eliminating eliminating. And um couldn't get we and this was weeks and you're like we are we don't have a company like we're dead. We are absolutely dead. And I feel like this is the kind of thing that desperate, you know, you get desperate. You're like, we're going to try kind of anything. And what we uh the engineer who was working on this um actually looked at the protocol between the CPU uh and the voltage regulator. So there's a protocol that it goes back and forth says hey I need this voltage and you know this is voltage and one of the things he notices is that there is no acknowledgement packet from the regulator. So the CPU asks for a voltage to be set to a certain level and he's noticing that there's no acknowledgement packet back from the regulator which should come which should come and the test that they've got something called SDLE which is this great uh test goober that you you take the CPU off you put on the SDLE and it will measure the power for you. Well the SDLE didn't care whether it got an acknowledgement packet or not. The CPU definitely did. And the CPU So the CPU says I want you to go to 0.9 volts. It never gets an acknowledgement back. And meanwhile sitting at 0.9 volts and it's just like, well, I never got an acknowledgement, so we're going to reset and I'll do it again. And that was due to a firmware bug on the Renaissance controller. And so they we got a firmware update from Renos and done. And I mean, to be fair, the Renaissance FA is great. Was like, well, you guys really should have reached out a lot sooner. Like, yeah, I know. We really wanted to make sure that we got like everything. Uh, and and that's the kind of problem. And there were many many problems like this where it's not merely intelligence. It's not building a a a board is not an IQ test. It's more I mean you need to be intelligent to do it but intelligence is not enough. You need these other kind of characteristics. Then I feel you also need a team in this case, right? You absolutely need a team. 100% 100% you need a team.

### AI作为工具：软件与硬件工程的差异

**Brian Caner** 强调，**LLM** 与**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）不应混淆，**LLM** 没有目标，而人类团队的共同目标才是创新的驱动力。**Oxide** 的工程师们将 **LLM** 作为编辑工具，例如他曾用 **LLM** 建议删除博客文章中的一个段落。在编写 **Rust** 代码时，**LLM** 也能帮助判断代码是否符合惯用法。他认为 **LLM** 在处理小问题时更有价值，而不是作为“机器人中层管理人员”。**Oxide** 鼓励员工对自己的工作负责，因此不能将错误归咎于 **LLM**。虽然 **LLM** 在软件工程中，尤其是在处理样板代码时，表现出色，但在 **Oxide** 这种涉及操作系统内核C语言编程的底层工作中，其价值较低。在硬件工程方面，**Brian** 坦言 **LLM** 几乎没有用处。尽管 **LLM** 可以帮助解释 **I²C**（Inter-Integrated Circuit: 一种串行通信总线协议，常用于微控制器与外设之间）波形等边缘任务，但硬件设计主要依赖于 **EDA工具**（Electronic Design Automation: 电子设计自动化，用于设计、仿真和验证电子系统的软件工具），如 **SolidWorks** 和 **Altium Designer**，进行布局和仿真，这些都是软件工具完成的工作。

Like you're you're going to solve these problems with, you know, you had that engineer who just like thought of measuring this out, right? Well, an engineer who was desperate, you know, because we were all getting desperate. Um, and you know, we and again, we've had many of these over the history of the company. Um, and you're right, you absolutely need a team. You need you need a team. And you see also the value when you have a team. People have different ways of approaching a problem. That diversity is really important because you need and actually sometimes this has happened more than once with the company where somebody kind of like is just kind of like walking through the problem and like someone's like hey I'm just joining you know about a remote company anyone joins a you know they joining the Google meet yeah I'm just joining because you know I think that I'm following along and you get someone will be like just make an like hey I got like a dumb question are those virtual addresses like those look like similar virtual addresses and you you get something where someone's making and you need someone to kind of like come and make that observation that is maybe less grounded in it and people like oh wait a minute no that's actually like well that's something to go check and so you need that that different kind of approach um that that is really a team kind of uniquely summons and you know I think you might have alluded to it but uh on the previous podcast Arman Ronacher mentioned to me he's uh the creator of Flask he's he's been around the block for for quite a while and he's now doing a startup and he said that right now It's just him and his co-founder and he's got an army of AI interns right now. He's prototyping him. But he told me, "I'd like to start to hire people soon because people bring energy and you need energy per company to live and and thrive." And I'm kind of sensing the same thing. Oh, for sure. No, for sure. And I, you know, just listened to this great piece with Richard Sutton who was the inventor of reinforcement learning and and I think rightfully I agree with him. It's like you guys are conflating an LLM with artificial intelligence. It doesn't have goals. This is really important. So like a prompt is not a goal and guessing the next word is not a goal. And but like us together as a startup and like wanting to make it together, not wanting to die here together, that's a goal. And that so we can use that creativity. Maybe we, you know, we use an LLM certainly as a tool to help us achieve our goal, but I I I do think that that's a very important distinction. And can you tell me like what kind of tools you use and and what are the areas that you you find it helpful? I understand you're experimenting with stuff and you know this is all work in progress, but where areas that that and you mentioned like the summarizing was was one example of glosseries. Yeah. Oh yeah. I mean and I I mean I use LMS as an editor all the time. Um I find it to be a really I mean actually it was funny. I had a blog entry that went on Hacker News and someone was like, "Oh, this is LLM written." I'm like, "Actually, it is LLM edited, but the only thing that I did based on the LM is I deleted an entire paragraph." So, there's a paragraph that like wasn't working and the LLM was like, "This paragraph is not working." And I'm like, "You know what? I'm just going to delete the paragraph." So, I was like, I I don't know. You want to say that's LM edited? Because like every word there is written by me, but there were some words that there was written by me that an LM social I deleted there, which I deleted. So I mean I use it for um in writing for sure. I mean I also like to use and this is like a stupid reason stupid thing but when you're writing Rust and we write a lot of Rust there especially when you're new to Rust this you you wonder like the way I just phrased this is this like idiomatic is there a better way to do this that that's a great little problem for like I got this small little snippet of code. Is this an idiomatic way of doing this? Is there a better way of doing this? And that's a great thing for an LLM to be to make a suggestion or not or tell you that like nope that's that's an idiomatic way of doing maybe I would make this small adjustment. So I find it really val I find LLMs to be more valuable in the small than in the large. Um so like again this kind of I I my you know hats off to people who want to uh spend their lives acting as a middle management for robots but like that's not necessarily for me. Um certainly at Oxide I mean our belief is that people take responsibility for their own work. So, if you want to have an LLM help you out on that, that's fine. But ultimately, like if there's a bug in this, like you can't blame the LLM. The L the LLM broke my code is like not interesting. That that that's LM don't have accountability. And so, one thing that is starting to spread across I think a lot of engineering is engineers using LMS either uh inside your ID with autocomplete or or and also kicking off now agents. Now, there's more advanced ones with like cloud code and and codecs where it can actually run command prompts and run your tests. Are you seeing engineers use some of these tools? And there's a little bit of back and forth as well. You know, like it's very clear that when it you're doing kind of more boilerplate things that are so-called on distribution, which is they they've learned like React TypeScript, it can spit out a bunch of stuff, but you strike me as someone who's doing a lot more nuance things. Yeah. I mean, you're writing a bunch you're running writing a bunch of C code in the operating system kernel. It's is it is less valuable. Yeah. Yeah. But so what are you seeing across the team in terms of you know I encourage people to to uh experiment and I would say we're seeing a a wide variety of experimentation certainly we've got we're using cloud code a bunch and people are doing that and um but I would you know broadly speaking for a lot of the work that we're doing um it is helpful as like maybe a polishing tool but less as a kind of the at the epicenter of its creation. It's not true of everything. There's some software for No, but but that that's also nice to hear cuz I'm I'm kind of asking you more to putting on your CTO hat who's who's also very like you know you're very hands-on and you know what's going on with the industry cuz a lot of non-hands executives are kind of looking their finger and thinking oh we must be 10 or 20 or 30% more productive but what what what I'm hearing is like things are kind of the same as before, right?

### Oxide的团队与未来挑战

**Brian Caner** 认为，AI是一个强大的工具，但不是唯一的工具。他鼓励工程师们尝试 **LLM**，了解其局限性，而不是完全排斥。他指出，编程是 **LLM** 的一个极佳用例，但某些程序员会因此错误地认为 **LLM** 将取代所有工作，这是一种狭隘的观点。**Oxide** 团队目前约有85名员工，涵盖了电子工程师、软件工程师等多个学科。他们通过独特的招聘流程吸引了对公司文化、问题和团队充满热情的人才。例如，**QA工程师**（Quality Assurance Engineer: 负责软件质量测试和保障的工程师）在 **Oxide** 受到与软件工程师同等的重视和薪酬，这吸引了最优秀的 **QA** 人才。**Brian** 强调，每家公司都有值得学习的优点和需要摒弃的缺点。例如，他从 **Oracle** 的 **Larry Ellison** 身上学到，CEO应该对公司的每一次招聘负责。

Yeah. I mean I mean my big belief is it's a tool. It's a powerful tool. I mean I will say that the thing I you know occasionally get people are like well I don't want to use it at all. And I'm like, you should. So, like, you should try, right? Yeah. Like, let me get you off of that position and let me, you know, we had Simon Wilson on our podcast. Simon's delightful. And, you know, one of the lines that he has that I really love is people should run these LLMs on their own laptop where they run slowly and poorly so they can see the bad output that they generate so they can understand what some of the limitations are. So, I I I definitely I love that. I I I do think that that uh people should use them enough to know where they are valuable. It's a very important tool in the toolbox. You want to be aware of it, but it's definitely reductive to think it's the only tool in the toolbox because it isn't. Now, you're in such an interesting company because like, you know, you don't not just do software, but you do a lot of hardware. Yeah. Have you found any use? No. No. No. Zero. I mean, okay, zero is a bit reductive. I have found it to be useful when, for example, you know, you've got a waveform of an I squed C transaction. it actually amazingly you can send that to an LLM and have it like interpret this like hey what what am I seeing I I squed C kind of compliant behavior and it can help you out on that a little bit but it's like absolutely at the edges okay so that's a 0.01 01. Also, like I think people don't realize like there are already tools for that. Like that's what EDA is. You spend a lot of money on like we're not laying stuff out like by hand with graph paper. Like this is like you've got, you know, when you do layout for a board, there are a bunch of rules that are automatically checked for SI, you know, we we've got a we do a bunch of simulation work. Like we're not doing that by hand. We're not we're using software. Yeah. I saw you have those machines in there. Like I I I saw that. I think it's a bit reassuring to hear because I think it's very clear like maybe we don't realize as software engineers but programming is such a great use case for LMS. It's a simple grammar you can validate it and I think it's sometimes nice to just you know touch sand of like an area that is very very different. Yes. But but it's it's cool that you're checking and you know you're seeing if if if it changes over time I guess you always keep checking. Yeah. And I I for sure and I think that like I I it is frustrating to me because it programming is such a good use case for certain kinds of programs. So as a result you end up with certain kinds of programmers who just in in part because of their own self-centric view of the universe believe that oh this is just going to replace every job and it's like no not even close not even close and you need to spend more time you need to get outside a little bit more.

### 远程硬件开发与公司文化传承

**Oxide** 作为一个硬件公司，大部分员工却远程工作。这得益于他们制造的是服务器而非大型机械，许多硬件工程工作可以通过 **EDA工具**（Electronic Design Automation: 电子设计自动化）如 **SolidWorks** 和 **Altium Designer** 在任何地方完成。物理性的工作，如首次启动（bring-up）和组装，则需要在制造商处进行，而这本身就需要出差。**Oxide** 的所有组装都在美国明尼苏达州进行。随着公司规模的扩大和客户的增长，**Brian Caner** 最关心的是如何在招聘中保持绝对的纪律性，以维护 **Oxide** 独特的文化和价值观。他认为，公司文化对每位 **Oxide** 员工都至关重要，这是他们能够吸引和留住人才的关键。他将公司的团队比作大学时期的派对，不同背景的人聚集在一起，总能带来惊喜和新的连接。他告诉团队，他们拥有“瓶中闪电”，不能将其视为理所当然，每个人都必须努力工作，同时保护和传承公司的核心价值。

Yeah. So speaking of getting outside and you know meeting different people what I noticed when I went to oxide is just like it was great. We had double ease as you say, software engineers, people used to work on virtual reality at at Oculus all in the same room. Can you tell me about how big is the team? What's the composition? Yeah, so we we're on you know we've I think you know we got some more offers going out tonight. So I think we've got on the order we'll be at like 85. I should probably keep better I should keep better mental track track of it. where we got like 85 plus minus and we you know we've been very blessed by uh we've really put a beacon out there. We've got a lot of people rooting for the company. We've got a lot of people and as a result we got a lot of people want to work for the company. So um you know we as we talked about last time um we really put a lot on folks to describe you know the work they've done what's important to them why they want to work for Oxide. I mean a lot of my LM use is I will look at someone's materials. As you can imagine, we've started to see materials that are heavily LLM authored. Potential applicants oxide, please do not do this. We get people who like who who human author their entire materials and then they get to the last question. Why do you want to work for Oxide? Why do you want to work in this role? And they have an LLM spit that out and you're like, do you think you want to work here? Like I'm just like, let's leave aside whether this is like, you know, is is this right or wrong or cheating or not? It's like fine, I guess, but like I don't think you want to work here. like you're not gonna get a job here because I don't think you actually want to work here. Put it in your own words. But that process really has allowed us to attract people who themselves are attracted to the company and attracted to the the culture, the problem, the team, and it's just extraordinary. I mean, it's I just feel so lucky to be with such an unbelievable group of people across more and more and more and more disciplines. I mean the great thing about our approach is it brings people in who are you know God it's like I love this approach for we talked about support engineering we I people who are like god I love this approach like finally QA can stand on its own two feet I I feel that that QA has been kind of subjugated by by these other disciplines now QA is kind of really thought to be as important as anything else in the company and it is because at some like at some like monetary perspective it is as important as anything else. Uh yeah, but but I remember like when I worked at Microsoft back like 15 years ago or so, the QAs were just on a lower pay grade, you know, like the senior QA was at the same as like I think software engineer 2 or something which just kind of implied Yeah. you're less important. You're less important. And so like if you tell the world that we think it's as important, do you know who you get? You get people who are extraordinary at QA. You get the best of the best. And so, um, that has been really exciting. And now we've got people coming. I mean, I do love how many different companies because my belief is that like every company has something to teach us that there there is something positive you can take from every company. Now, there are some companies, it's like, you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel. Maybe not an Ronaldo. They did buy some. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's like there are like even Oracle you can find. There are that may be a bit of a challenge. Let's not do that one. Uh but you know what uh the and and at the time I thought this was a negative but now I'm like I see it. Larry Ellison makes every hiring decision at Oracle. So what's positive about that? Exactly. Which be like what's I really the I really think that the kind of the founder mode the Paul Graham essay on founder mode is talking about founders that lost track of their own hiring. So I think now I don't like the way Ellison does it. I think that you want to have you want to trust a team to make a decision, but ultimately I believe that the that the CEO of a company bears responsibility on every single hire and I think should be looking at every single hire coming into your company and that that is to me that is a very important check on these kind of companies that that so that is there you go something that I've something that positive I take from and it's telling that your immediate reaction is like wait what's positive about that? Yeah. I'm I'm not sure like I'm not sure you undid that that talk on on Oracle. Yeah. Fair enough. Fair enough. Exactly. Yeah. And there from some companies more than others, but I think that there are and so I love having all of these different experiences present at Oxide because I do think that there's so much to learn and we're trying, you know, you want to take all the positive things cuz I also think that every company including, you know, people I actually one of the questions I love that I got once is like, what do you not want to emulate from Sun? I'm like, "Oh, thank God." Because like think people think of oxide as kind of the second coming of Sun Microsystems and like I there are lots of things I loved about Sun. There are lots of things I did not love about Sun that I did not want to emulate and so I think for any also any company there are things we want to leave behind and you know I think when you've got a big diverse team you you get to go do that. And one thing that really surprised me last time I I was at your office is turns out that most people were not in the office and and they work remote and I I would understand for software but how do you make that work for hardware development where physically you do need to you know be at the the hardware sometimes I understand you need to measure stuff I saw a lot of like you know you know units sometimes you need to go to like check on manufacturing how does that part work yeah so I mean uh a lot in people's basements um so you know fortunately we're making you know this is the advantage of making a server and not making like you know a tractor or like you know we're not making like a you know I don't know like a wind turbine or something you know this is something that people can actually model in their basement um so that helps but then a lot of even hardware engineering is using these software tools using EDA tools you're using solid works you're using LTM you're kind of putting this thing together you when you're doing layout for example um which is very important task when you're laying out a board all of that is that that can be done anywhere that's all just software Okay.

### AI时代的职业发展与推荐书籍

展望未来，**Brian Caner** 认为AI工具将使我们能够完成更多工作，但它们只是工具，不会取代所有工作。他担心年轻的软件工程师可能会感到绝望，认为AI将威胁他们的工作。然而，他认为这是一个鼓励新公司成立的绝佳机会，工程师们应该思考“如果能构建任何东西，你会构建什么？”这种心态比依赖大公司提供工作更具挑战性，但也带来了更多机会。对于学生或经验不足的工程师，**Brian** 建议他们转变心态，专注于每天如何变得更好。**LLM** 是一个极好的学习工具，可以帮助人们深入了解新领域，克服恐惧。他强调，你需要拥有一个不断学习和进步的心态，认识到自己还有很多不了解的地方。他开玩笑说，自己一直在等待了解计算机如何工作的那一天，但每天都在学习新的复杂性。他鼓励人们将 **LLM** 视为私人教练，尽管需要事实核查其答案，但这使得进入新领域比以往任何时候都更容易。最后，他推荐了三本书：**Tracy Kidder** 的《**新机器的灵魂**》（Soul of a New Machine: 讲述了数据通用公司工程师构建新计算机的故事），**Ben Rich** 的《**臭鼬工厂**》（Skunk Works: 洛克希德·马丁公司臭鼬工厂的历史，关于工程师如何完成不可能任务的故事），以及 **Randall Stross** 的《**史蒂夫·乔布斯与下一个大事件**》（Steve Jobs and the Next Big Thing: 描绘了史蒂夫·乔布斯在 **NeXT** 公司的低谷时期，以及这些失败如何为 **Apple** 的复兴奠定基础）。

And so the the there are things that are where that physicality is very important. And then when you're doing bringup, you actually need to be at your manufacturer when you do that. So like that is also not in an office. You would need to travel anyway. Yeah. You need to travel anyway. And anyone coming electronics industry is like, "Okay, I'm interested in oxide, but please tell me I never have to go spend any time in Taipei or Beijing." Because you go out there for, you know, or Shenzhen or wherever. And you're out there for two weeks in a windowless office trying to get this thing brought up. And um we all of our assembly is done here in the United States of Minnesota. So we are all in fact we've got a bunch of folks out there this week for uh at Benchmark Electronics in Rochester. So this is wonderful. And one thing that you told me is one of the things that's on top of your mind right now as oxide is growing. You still have this culture of the the same compensation full remote. So like it's it's kind of been the same since the start. What what will be the challenge in in maintaining it? Because again you worked at large companies. You've seen how it goes. it can get tricky. What what are the things that you're seeing and what are the things that you're trying to do to you know keep this kind of start of vibe even even as you might be just bigger. Yeah. So I I think that the thing that is that is top of mind right now for me um is and especially because you know we raised a big series B which is great. Um I think much more importantly we're seeing a lot of customer traction which is great. So we've seen paying off. Yeah. No it really is. It's really great and we kind of knew that was going to happen in the abstract. Um, but it's fun to actually see it happen and fun to actually see um the customers that have, you know, like, you know, I bought one rack and I mentioned it, but now I want to buy a lot more racks. I love what I'm seeing and I want, you know, that's great. Very, very, very exciting stuff. That means we're growing the company a bunch. And one of the things that's very important to me, because I've seen this happen so many times, is companies take their eye off the ball when it comes to hiring in in particular. And it is very important to me that we continue to have absolute discipline in the way we hire. And uh we we're doing that. And fortunately, you know, the nice thing about our hiring process is every single Oxide employee has gone through it. So it's like I'm not having to persuade anyone about the importance of our process because everybody has gone through it and that you know the thing that we've got overwhelmingly in our favor is because we've used our values as a lens for that hiring. Oxide's culture is important to every single person at Oxide. That's what it takes to to really preserve that. And it it doesn't mean that it won't change at all, but the bones aren't changing. Like what what will change is it will be bigger and it will be I think you know and I love the fact that you know even at like 85 we're already so big that you know Steve and I know everybody at the company but very few other people know everybody at the company. So when we get everyone together, it's like the best party you've ever been to because you know when in college I used to throw the best parties in college. And the reason I threw the best parties in college is not because of me. It was because of the roommates that I had. So like I was a computer science student who played ultimate. My roommate was an engineer who was on the water polo team. My other roommate was a was a history student who was in the chorus. That's six different demographics that don't normally overlap. And then very importantly, we made sure that the women's swim team was always invited. The women's swim team, they were like the foundation water player. Yeah, exactly. Waterfall. You always check their calendar to make sure they can make what And people loved the parties we have. Why? Because they would meet people that they never met before who were really interesting and they and what I love about Oxide is we've got this when when we get the whole team together, people get the all these delightful surprises. So people take me aside and be like, "God, you know, Ry is awesome." I'm like, "Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know. You know, too now. That's great." But like, you know, or you know, whomever it is. It's it's just it's really exhilarating. And I think that also serves to reinforce how important what we've got is. I tell the team like, we have lightning in a bottle. And we cannot take it for granted. And that means that every single one of us need we we need to rise to the moment. We need to do what our customers need us to do, but we need to do it in a way that protects and preserves what got us here. So thinking a little bit ahead, let's assume that, you know, these AI tools will just get better eventually. They'll be able to, you know, help more even on on your kind of low-level things. You've been in the industry for quite a while. You've you've seen a lot of shifts. What are what do you think are are some of the things both in software engineering or in hardware engineering or just in general engineering that will probably not change even if we predict uh these these things being like more capable? Yeah, I think that what we I mean I think that that it's certainly a revolution. I think it's going to allow us all to do more. I do think that we are going to hit a point where people understand that this is a tool where because there's a little bit where we're still have this tension of like, oh, is this going to be AGI? Is this going to replace all jobs? And this is like nonsense as far as I'm concerned. And it's distracting kind of nonsense. And we actually need to get back to putting the tools in the toolbox of of the human that's building it. Now these tools have become much more powerful and I think that that's going to be I think that's extraordinary. I think it's important. I think that also we'll be you know we've got a lot of experiments right now we humanity that I'm I'm not sure are going to make economic sense. So you know we we'll be figuring that out as well. Um but I think that you know one of the things I am a little bit worried about is a little bit of despair from younger software engineers in particular who are like what's the point like an AI can do all this well and there's also the news even from more experienced software engineers in the mainstream media there's this news that company X is laying off healthier workforce because of AI and by the way when we look closer it's not because of AI but it it is coming across and it does give not younger people a lot of anxiety tons even like mid mid-level folks or even some more experienced like it it does give a sense of I think it's the first time in computer history that most of us remember that there is this thing that could threaten my job and I I think we've just never had to deal with this. I think you know there there are industries that might have been a bit more used to it. Yeah, I would say that we I mean there have been busts before. The knock on bust was a bust like a lot of jobs did disappear, right? So I think that we but the bus has really come in in what feels to be a broader and more permanent way. I I I mean my view is like this is an opportunity for I mean I think one of the things we should be society really encouraging is new company formation because now I mean just like you're talking to Armen about how you know just a small group you know just Armen and his co-founder were able to do so much together right we should be really encouraging that and what are some of the gaps that we can all go fill because ultimately like we we all need to find a livelihood we need to find meaning and the way we do that as engineers is we build useful things. And so we're like, we can now build many more useful things. What would we go build? What would if you could build anything, what would you go build? And that's kind of the question that people need to ask themselves. It's scarier. It's scarier than like go to this school, get concentrate in this, and then mama Google will hire you and take care of you and feed you breakfast. It's like no, that's not like that's not what's going to happen. And it feels a lot scarier because it feels like there's at some level like less security, less job security. But yeah, that's true that you know that and and that that's scarier, but there's also a lot more opportunity. And for a for a college student or or some someone in school or or with little experience who says like, look, my goal would be one day in like 5 years time to be as good that I could get a job at a place like Oxide. it doesn't need to be oxide but again a place that has a high bar they're they often hire experienced people but I want to get there and yeah there's all this AI stuff as hell happening what would you advise them in terms of what to focus on what what areas to study what things to do or how to think about like you know like they have the the goal is there what advice would you have them part with yeah so I think that they need that that you need to have a different mindset and that mindset needs to be not around how do I create as much as possible, but rather how do I get better? How am I getting better every day? And I think LMS are a great tool to get better. How can I learn about something new? Go deeper. Go into something that I wouldn't go into before. Get over that kind of that fear. And one needs to especially if you're coming, you're in school now, you want to work at a place like Oxide. It's like you you kind of have to view it as like all right, like you you want to play Major League Baseball, that's great. like you're a you're a great high school player. You want to play Major League Baseball. It's really hard. Got to get better every single day and you you're going to be need to be really focused on getting better and you need to be like really realistic about like what I need to go do to get better. And it's hard but and it's chancy because you might not get there but you could get there and the and you're certainly not going to get there if you don't focus on that kind of self-improvement. So I I I really think that that it there is a shift in mindset that that needs to happen or that one needs to have I would put that way. One you really got to have a mindset towards getting better understanding more. What do you not understand? There is lots that you don't understand. I mean I think one of the the the challenges of modernity is that we delude ourselves into thinking that we understand it all. You don't. I don't. Like one of the things that I've learned, I've joked at oxide that like I keep waiting for the day that I know how computers work and it like like it wasn't today definitely wasn't yesterday. It's not like it's going to work. You understand how but I mean that earnestly in that the the the the amount of of complexity that I that I definitely I mean I knew but also didn't know. It's like every day I feel I'm still learning new facets and not just like a computer but actually delivering a computer to people. There's there's so much to learn out there. So many op and and now with the way you've got to view LLM is not like this thing is coming from my job. You got to view it as like no I've got now this like private coach tutor what have you that I can ask any question to. It's not going to I got to like fact check its answers for sure but now you've got the opportunity to and you got it is easier to get into this domain than it ever has been. And that is that's great and it's powerful, but it can also be scary. And as closing, what's a book or two books that you would recommend to folks and why? Oh, so many good books. You know, my my uh my I've got a I've got a 21-year-old, an 18-year-old, and a 13-year-old. And when the 18-year-old was in his he's now a freshman in college, he's a high school senior. He got this assignment, great assignment from his his English teacher, namely go to someone that you that that you know and ask them for three books that they would recommend that you read and I'm going to assign you one of those three books to read and you're going to read it and then you're going to talk with them about that book. And I'm like, "Oh, I love this assignment." So he's like, "Dad, I'm coming to you." And I'm like, "Oh, you have Thank you so and of course my wife was like, "Why didn't you come to me?" Like, "Hey, look, I'm, you know, I sorry, you know, look, uh, it was great." So yeah, I I'll give you those three books that that that I gave to him and I think that each of these is really terrific. Uh first is Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kder. So this one won the Puliter Prize uh in 1980 or 1981, but about the the the building of a new computer at data general and it's a it's extraordinarily well written and even folks like well I'm not like what do I have to do with a computer company in the late 70s and early 80s? any engineer will see something of themselves in that book. It is just masterfully told. Tom West who's the the is is is kind of a complicated figure but that is soul is still I mean it it it it's literature for us. So I would absolutely solve a new machine every engineer should read Soul a new machine by Tracy KDR. Um for me personally um very influential was skunk works by Ben Rich. So about the the the history of skunk works. Um Clarence Kelly Thompson was the with kind of the originator of skunk works at Loheed Martin. Uh extraordinary story about what engineers can do when they they kind of task themselves on the impossible. Um it's such a good book. It's such a good book. Amazing book. And then the uh the other one is Steve Jobs and the next big thing by Randall Straws. So um Steve Jobs is kind of like lionized by the industry but people forget about a very important chapter of his life namely next and I believe we are it it was just an anniversary maybe it was the 30th anniversary it must have been of the or maybe the 40th anniversary Jesus of the the announcement of the next machine. So the um Steve Jobs left Apple, was fired from Apple, started a computer company called Next. Uh really interesting company in a lot of ways. Was at Next for a very long time. It's a 13-year journey before Next was bought by Apple. Next is bought by Apple. Steve Jobs returns to Apple when they buy Next. This book, Steve Jobs and the Next Big Thing, is written before Apple buys Next. And it is at Steve Jobs's lowest moment. It it is not here to praise him. It is here to bury him. And it is very interesting about all the missteps at next and the thing that we cannot know because Jobs obviously died but I believe having read the book which gets basically next gets essentially no treatment in the Isixson biography. Next is like six pages of glory. It's like that's not what it was. Um, but Rand Straw's book is is masterful and in particular I believe that Jobs's failures at Next were essential for for the resurrection of Apple. And there because you look at the way he handled himself coming back to Apple was very different from the jobs that got fired from Apple. And I think that like when people look at Jobs like they don't really take him apart. And I think you should because I think he's a really interesting guy. He's enigmatic. He's someone like he did things that I that I think are really fascinating and also things that I really strongly disagree with. So just to be clear, I'm not like but I think that he's he's indisputably an important figure and that book is by far the best book. So Steve Jobs No, I'm adding that. I actually want to read that now. Oh, it's extraordinary. It's very good. Well, Brian, this was such a fun discussion. Oh, my my pleasure. I mean, we knew this was going to be long and wide ranging, so hopefully it delivered, but uh I I really appreciate the went from from the '90s all the way to the future. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for having your guy. It was terrific. I've got to say Oxide is one of my favorite companies, and I say this as someone who has zero affiliation with them. It's just so rare to find a startup that built both hardware and software and are world class in doing both of these and are so open about talking exactly how they do it all. Honestly, the only downside I can think about Oxide is how their server racks are built for pretty large companies and are definitely out of reach for hobbies devs. In this episode, I really appreciated how much of a straight shooter Brian was, especially about the impact of AI tools. Yes, everyone at Oxide uses them and they do find use cases for coding and working with documents, but it's eye opening how it gives them basically zero help with hardware engineering. This is a good reminder that LMS might be the single best fit for coding related tasks. And as devs, we should know that these tools might be more specialized than many people think. I hope you enjoyed the stories in this episode as much as I did. If you'd like to learn more about Oxide, I did a two-part deep dive about the company, and you can read it linked in the show notes below.
