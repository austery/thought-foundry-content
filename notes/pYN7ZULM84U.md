### 从医学生到软件工程师的转变

**主持人：**Michelle，欢迎来到我们的播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Michelle, welcome to the podcast.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**谢谢，G。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Thanks, G. I'm so glad to be here.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**很高兴你能来。你是如何进入软件工程领域的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's awesome to have you. How did you get into software engineering?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我其实是在大学开始的。我最开始加入了一个创业俱乐部，当时在做一个生物科技公司。但我每周都发现，俱乐部里进展最快的公司都是那些团队里有程序员的。所以我觉得，如果我想在创业路上走得更快，我就得自己学会构建产品，这样我们才能更快地前进。于是，我在大一的春季学期上了我人生第一堂计算机科学课，这相比你们的大多数听众来说，已经算很晚了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I actually started in college. I first joined an entrepreneurship club and I was working on a bio company but every week I saw that the companies in my club that were making the most progress were people who had programmers on their team. So I felt like oh like if I wanted to move faster in entrepreneurship I wanted to actually build the thing myself so we can move a lot faster. So, I took my first computer science class ever in the spring of my freshman year, which is very late compared to I think most of your listeners.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是啊，但什么时候开始都不算晚，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's it's never too late, is it?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**永远不晚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Never too late.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**从那以后，你是转到了计算机科学专业吗？是在大学里开始学习，还是在业余时间自学？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then from there on, did you move over to computer science? Did you start studying at a university or did you do it on the side?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的。从那一刻起，我开始主修计算机科学。我真的爱上了计算机科学，尤其是调试（debugging）过程，这是我最喜欢的部分，我觉得对大多数人来说这可能挺奇怪的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, at that moment, I actually then started majoring in computer science. Um, I really fell in love with computer science, especially the debugging was my favorite part, which is really funny for most people, I think.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**背景故事是，我差点成了一名医生。我在新加坡长大，在那里，如果你擅长理科，当医生就是理所当然的选择。我当时非常热爱医学，因为我特别喜欢诊断，比如鉴别诊断。比如，有人左腿肿胀地走进来，你可能会想：“哦，这可能是右肺出了问题。”我觉得这太酷了。或者根据你眼睛看到的景象，可以判断出大脑某个特定部位出了故障。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the backstory was that I almost became a medical doctor. Like, I grew up in Singapore. Yeah. Where that was the uh the thing to do if you're good at the sciences. And I really fell in in love with medicine because I really liked diagnosis, like differential diagnosis. you know, someone comes in with, you know, a swollen left leg, you're like, "Oh, that could be a problem with your right lung." And I thought that that was so cool. Or based on the vision that you're seeing of your eyes, it could be a very specific part of your brain that was malfunctioning.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**所以，我非常喜欢计算机科学作业中的调试环节，我开始发现 bug 的出现总是有规律可循，然后我就可以追溯到导致问题的具体代码行或系统。我感觉自己就像是电脑的医生，这也让我在构建东西方面获得了很大的帮助，这是我非常热爱的。我开始在科技公司实习，并真正爱上了软件工程这门艺术，这进一步证实了我对软件工程的热爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I really liked the debugging part of my computer science assignments where I started seeing that there was always a pattern in which the bugs occurred and then I could trace it back to the specific lines of code or systems that led to it. So I felt like almost like I was a doctor for the computer and I it also helped me a lot in terms of being able to build things which I really love. I started uh interning at um tech companies and really fell in love with the with the art of software engineering um and that that just further um validated that I really love software engineering.</p>
</details>

### 从大公司实习中找准方向

**主持人：**之后你在一些非常酷的公司实习过。我记得有 Meta、Slack 和 Robin Hood。获得第一份实习机会有多难？第一份总是最难的。你在这些地方学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then you entered at some really cool companies. I think it was Meta, Slack, Robin Hood. How easy or hard was it to get into get your first internship? Obviously, the first one is always going to be the hardest. And then what did you learn at these places?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我非常幸运，我们大学有一个项目，会把学生安排到科技公司实习。我的第一份实习其实是在巴西圣保罗，在一家医疗保健公司做实习生。那是我真正起步的地方，我在那里从一位非常资深的巴西开发者身上学到了软件工程。所以我非常感谢那段经历。对于那些大学里有类似项目的听众，我建议你们联系学校的职业办公室，他们能为你的职业生涯开个好头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I was very lucky to um have had this university program where they actually placed students in tech companies. Um and my very very first internship actually was in Sa Paulo, Brazil. Um where I was working as an intern for a healthcare company. And that was where I really got my start and really learned uh software engineering from a very senior developer there in Brazil. Um so I'm very thankful for uh for that. And for um guess the listeners who have university programs who are in student school um reach out to the careers office. They could be really helpful in helping you get your start.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**至于 Facebook（现 Meta），我是通过自己申请网站，加入了一个叫做 **Facebook University** 的项目。这个项目是为计算机科学领域中代表性不足的新手设立的。他们会把你带入项目，然后进行为期两周的新兵训练营，每天都要开发一个应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for Facebook. It was uh also it was me co-applying to uh the website uh to this program called the Facebook University. So this is for folks who are underrepresented um and who are new to computer science and they bring you into the program and then bring you through a a two-eek boot camp where you're building an app every single day. So there every single day.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**这还是在 AI 时代之前，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> this is pre prei, right?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，在 AI 之前。我当时用双手在 Java 环境下编写安卓应用。每天我们都在构建应用，两周的新兵训练营结束后，我们被分到各个小组，需要在实习结束前构建一个功能齐全的应用。那是我第一次学习 **Git**（一种分布式版本控制系统），学会了如何与朋友协作，如何阅读大型代码库。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This is prei. So I was using my hands to uh write Android apps in Java and so every day we were building apps and then after the twoe boot camp we were put into pods where we had to build a fully functioning app by the end of the internship and that's when I learned git for the first time. I learned how to collaborate with my friends. Um I learned how to read uh really large code bases.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我们当时在开发一个收据分摊应用，通过 **OCR**（Optical Character Recognition: 光学字符识别）和蓝牙技术，你可以找到附近的朋友，然后把他们的头像拖拽到收据项目上。比如，如果有三颗西兰花，你吃了两颗，我吃了一颗，我就会把你的头像拖到那个项目上两次，我的拖一次，然后应用就会相应地分摊费用。这非常有趣，也很酷，因为分摊收据是我个人的一个痛点。但我们最终不得不深入研究谷歌的 OCR 开源库以及一个在线的蓝牙协议。所以，我在这方面变得非常擅长。我也很幸运，我们团队的应用最终被评为实习项目中的最佳应用之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um because we were uh building a receipt splitting app. um through OCR as well as like Bluetooth where you could find your friends near you and then drag and drop avatars into uh the receipt items. So if there are three broccololis and you ate two broccololis and I ate one broccoli, I would drag avatar twice into the receipt item and mine once and then it would split accordingly. It was really fun, really cool because this was a personal problem of mine, splitting receipts, but we ended up having to dig really deep into uh the uh open source libraries of uh the OCR from Google as well as like a Bluetooth protocol um that was online. So, I became really good at that. And I was also very fortunate that like our team actually won for being one of the best apps in the internship program.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Awesome.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**还在他的办公室见到了马克·扎克伯格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And got to meet Mark Zuckerberg uh in his office.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**哇。在 Facebook 实习之后，你还在 Slack 和 Robin Hood 工作了一段时间，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wow. So after a Facebook internship, you ended up working a little bit at Slack and at Robin Hood as well, right?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，没错。正是在那里，我真正迷上了初创公司。我通过 **Kleiner Perkins** 奖学金项目加入了 Slack。这是一个为学生提供的奖学金项目，让他们在暑期到这家风险投资公司的投资组合公司实习。当时，我认识的人里没人真正使用 Slack。公司那时只有 1200 人。我很高兴有机会去看看所谓的“创业圈”到底是什么样子。当时我认为 Slack 是一家初创公司。现在回想起来，它不算初创公司，但对我来说感觉就像是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that's right. Um and that was where I really caught the uh startup bugs. So um I joined Slack through the uh Kleiner Perkins fellowship program. So um this is like a fellowship program for uh for students to intern over the summer with the portfolio companies of this VC called Kleiner Perkins. Um, and at the time no one I knew was really using Slack. It was only 1,200 people uh at the time. And um I was really excited about the chance to uh see what this whole like startup scene was like. I mean at the time I considered Slack a startup. Like looking back it's not a startup but it felt like a startup to me. Like someone who at the time wasn't really familiar with tech companies and I had such a good time uh at Slack.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**我觉得公平地说，今天的 Slack 或许不是初创公司，但与许多公司相比，他们至今仍然更像一家初创公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I think we can also be fair like sure Slack today is maybe not a startup but like compared to a lot of companies they still act way more than a startup even today.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦是的，那段经历非常棒。每个人都有很强的产品所有权感。在那里工作非常有趣，因为你每天都在使用自己正在构建的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah it was it was really awesome. Everyone had so much product ownership. It was a lot of fun because it was also incredible to be at a company where you were using the product that you were building every single day.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**比如，我开始使用一个功能，然后我会想：“哦，我觉得每次需要用表情回应时都得搜索一遍太麻烦了，我们能不能加一个‘常用表情’的功能？”然后我就自己设计了原型，发到一个叫“功能请求”的频道里。当时，Stewart Butterfield（Slack 的 CEO）回复说：“是的，我们应该做这个。”然后我又有另一个想法，关于定时发送消息，这样我就不用等到想发送的时间才去发。我也把这个想法发到了那个频道，他说：“啊，那太不自然了，我们永远不会做这个。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. like it was like I would start using a feature um then I would be like oh like I think that instead of me having to search through my emojis every time I need to react what if we put like a frequently used emoji like you know I I I'll design it myself post it in this like feature request channel and Steuart Butterfield at the time responded being like yes we should do this and then I had another idea around like scheduling messages so that um I didn't have to wait till the time I wanted to send message to send it out and I posted it to the channel as well and he said, "Ah, that's so unnatural. We'll never do that." [laughter]</p>
</details>

**主持人：**但能直接从 CEO 或联合创始人那里得到反馈，这真的很酷。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But that's really cool getting feedback straight from the CEO or co-founder. That's awesome.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**能身处一个 CEO 对产品如此充满热情的文化中，感觉真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That was like such an awesome uh culture to be in where the CEO was so excited about the product.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**我觉得这种文化说明了很多问题，无论是在 Meta 还是在 Slack。CEO 和联合创始人愿意与人交流，这本身就很有意义。当然，他们不会花一整天和实习生或新员工聊天，但他们确实会这样做，而且平易近人。我觉得这使得一些公司与其他那些根本不可能做到这一点的公司之间产生了巨大的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I feel the culture talks a lot, you know, both at Meta and and at Slack. The fact that the CEO and co-founder is very is open to talking. Okay, they're not going to spend whole day, you know, talking with like interns or or new joiners, but they do and they're accessible. I feel that's going to make a big difference between, you know, like some companies and then other companies where this is impossible.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**当然。尤其是现在，作为一名创始人，我总是确保花大量时间，慷慨地与团队成员交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely. Yeah. Um especially now as a as a founder myself, like I always make sure to spend a lot of time and be generous in my time with with people on my team.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**那么你在 Robin Hood 学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then what did you learn at Robin Hood?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我是在一个科技招聘会上了解到 Robin Hood 的。在 Robin Hood，我真正找到了自己在软件工程领域的热爱所在。我当时在做 Robin Hood 的新闻标签页。这个标签页让用户可以看到当天的新闻，以及这些新闻如何影响他们的股票。当时，Robin Hood 只有三个标签页。第一个是主页，用于交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So Robin Hood I found uh through uh through a tech fair. Um, Robin Hood was where I really found my sweet spot about what I loved uh to do in software engineering. I was working on the Robin Hood news tab. So, um, this is a tab that let you see let users see the the news for the day and how that would, you know, affect their their their stocks. And at the time, Robin Hood only had three tabs. The first tab was the main tab, you know, trade</p>
</details>

**主持人：**投资组合，交易，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> portfolio trade. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**第三个标签页是设置，比如通知。我负责的是第二个标签页，当时大概有五六个人在做那个主标签页。我负责决定在每个人的信息流中显示什么新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then the third tab was like settings, so notification, and I was working on the second tab, and I had it was maybe like five or six of us working on that main tab. Um, and I was in charge of deciding um what news to show on every person's feed.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是的，而且有数百万人使用它，并根据这些信息做决策。这可不是什么隐藏功能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And this is like millions of people using it, right? And making decisions based on that. like this is like not some like hidden feature.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，我当时才 19 或 20 岁，非常年轻，但他们给了我构建这个功能的机会。我发现我非常热爱这份工作，找到了自己的最佳位置。我觉得我既能接触到非常酷的计算机科学概念，比如我们使用 Robin Hood 版本的 **Kafka**（一种分布式流处理平台）来处理数据管道，因为我们需要解析来自彭博社等合作伙伴的视频和新闻源，然后给它们打上标签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And I was 19 or 20 uh very young and they gave me that opportunity to build that and I really found that I love I love that I found my sweet spot in that I felt like I got to work on very cool computer science concepts like we were using Robin Hood version of Cafka to do the data pipelines when we received for messaging. Yeah. for the messaging because we had to parse um the uh video feeds and the news feeds coming from a lot of our partners like like Bloomberg was selling the news to us and then we had to then tag them.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**然后根据标签以及用户的投资情况，来决定哪些新闻是相关的，如果信息太稀疏该怎么办，如何填充信息流以避免机器学习的偏见，因为我们还想不断学习如何对内容进行排序。如果你用一种非常规范的方式来排序信息流，那么你就会给决定哪个项目最有趣的机器学习算法提供有偏见的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and then based on the tags and as well as like what the users uh were invested in figure out like what are the relevant news what to do if it's too sparse how do you um populate the feed such as there no bias for machine learning cuz we also wanted to keep learning what to rank first. And if you had a very prescriptive way of uh ranking your feed, then you would just be giving biased data to the machine learning algorithm for deciding what is the most interesting uh item.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**所以对我来说，这非常令人兴奋。因为一方面，我在学习一个非常酷的计算机科学概念；另一方面，我也在决定很多产品需求，比如用户想要什么，但基于我们的商业伙伴、技术栈和延迟要求，技术上又有哪些是可行的。我觉得我能够调动大脑的各个部分，既思考技术层面，也思考产品层面。正因为如此，我才觉得，哇，我真的热爱软件工程，这就是我想待的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like to me like that was really exciting because one I was learning a really cool computer science concept but then two I was also deciding like a lot of the product requirements you know what does the user want but then what is technically feasible based on what are the business partners we had and like based on our tech stack and then based on like latency requirements. So I felt like I was able to activate like like all parts of my brain thinking about the technical side but also the product side and because of that I felt like oh I I really love software engineering like this this is where I want to be.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你热爱的是软件工程、初创公司，还是两者都爱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you love software engineering startups or both?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**实际上两者都爱。从 Facebook 到 Slack，再到 Robin Hood，在我实习的过程中，这些公司的规模实际上是越来越小的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um it was actually both Facebook's Slack and then Robin Hood. Um they actually became smaller and smaller right as I did my internships.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是的，从 12000 人的公司，到 Slack 的 1200 人，再到 Robin Hood 的 300 人。我发现每当公司规模下降大约一个数量级，我就感觉拥有了更多的所有权，而且我所做的工作与用户受到的影响之间的联系也变得异常清晰。所以我知道，既然我已经体验了 12000 人、1200 人和 300 人的公司，那么下一步显然就是加入一个只有两个人的公司，然后再创办自己的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. from uh 12,000 people to,200 at Slack and then 300 at Robin Hood. And I found that every time I went down, like roughly an order of magnitude, um I felt like way more ownership and I felt like the line of sight between me building and the users impact that I was making was extremely clear. And so I knew like okay now that I've done the 12,000 the 1200 and then 300 obviously the next step is like joining a twoerson company and then starting my own.</p>
</details>

### 冒险一跃：加入种子期初创公司 Warp

**主持人：**难以置信，你在三个暑假里完成了四次实习，这太了不起了。现在你的简历上有这么多公司的经历，我想你可以选择加入很多不同的公司。但你却决定加入这家当时完全不知名的公司。它刚刚融到一些资金，看起来像是一场相当冒险的赌博，加入一家早期或种子阶段的初创公司。告诉我你当时是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's incredible. You had four internships in I guess in four different summers. uh three summers and in in three summers you kind of had them together which is amazing and now like you had all these companies behind your back on your resume. I'm assuming you know you could have decided to go into a bunch of different companies and then yet you decided to go into this unknown company that at the time was was completely unknown. It just raised something. It seems like a pretty risky bet to go into a early stage or like seedstage startup. Tell me what was your thinking after this?</p>
</details>

**主持人：**在你经历了这些不同规模的公司之后，你是如何最终选择了一家如此小的公司？老实说，这感觉像是一次巨大的冒险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">again you've you've seen these different companies and how did you end up at like such a small company kind of it it felt like taking a big risk I'll be honest</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦是的，这确实是一次非常大的冒险。当时还没有写任何代码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> oh yeah um it was it was a very big risk there wasn't any code written yet at the time</p>
</details>

**主持人：**没有代码？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> there was no code</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**没有代码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> no code written um</p>
</details>

**主持人：**所以当时只有一个想法和一个带着想法的创始人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so it was just an idea and like a founder with an idea or</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**有一些非常漂亮的设计稿。Warp 的第一位员工其实是一名设计师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> they were very nice mocks um the first the first hire at warp was actually a designer</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你能告诉我当时 Warp 的想法和阶段是怎样的吗？愿景是什么？设计稿是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and and then can you tell me like what was the kind of idea what was the stage at warp when you came there what was the vision what were the mocks like Oh yeah.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**首先，公司当时的名字叫 Denver。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, it was called Denver at the time.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**Denver。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Denver.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**Denver。我记得当时我就想，如果考虑 **SEO**（Search Engine Optimization: 搜索引擎优化），“Denver terminal” 绝对不是个好名字。那时我就已经有了很多关于增长的直觉。但那只是个临时名字，创始人 Zach 还在考虑其他名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Denver. And um I remember being like, if you want to think about SEO, Denver terminal is definitely not the way to go. Back then, I already had like a lot of growth intuition. Um but it was meant as a as a placeholder as they figure out what the as Zach, the founder, was thinking about names.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**关键的设计稿是一个终端，输入框固定在最底部，还有一个闪烁的光标，是线形的而不是矩形的。还有一个“块”的概念，终端的输入和输出被组合在一起，块与块之间有分隔线。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, so there was the key mock was a terminal that had the terminal input at the bottom anchored at the very bottom. And then there was a blinking cursor that was a line instead of a rectangle. And then there was a concept of blocks where terminal inputs and outputs were grouped together and there were lines between the blocks</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**第二个设计稿是关于协作的。我们在每个终端块上都有不同的头像。这几乎就像 Google Docs 或 Figma，你可以让多个人同时查看这个终端，这太酷了。然后还有共享环境变量和预设的概念。因为我们都知道，尤其是在团队中，管理环境变量是件非常痛苦的事。没人愿意承认，但我敢肯定每个人都有过通过 Slack 发送环境变量的经历，那可不是什么好办法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that was the key the key one. And then I think the second mock was collaboration. So we had like different avatars on each of the terminal um blocks. So it was almost like Google Docs or Figma like oh you could have multiple people looking at this mock at at this terminal. That's so cool. And then there was the concept of like sharing environment variables and presets. Um cuz we all know like everyone is such a pain to get environment variables uh especially in teams. I mean, no one wants to confess this, but I'm sure everyone has had send has has experience of sending environment variables through Slack. Um, and that's it's no good.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是的，当然，你总会把它们放在本地文件里，这是必需的，但正如你所说，共享它们是个问题。你不想把它们放到 GitHub 上，但又该如何传输呢？是的，正是这样，共享那些本不该共享的密钥，因为你的同事需要它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and also, of course, I mean, you always have them in your local files, which is a necessity, but yeah, as you said, sharing them. You don't want to put it into GitHub, but yeah, how do you transfer them? Yeah, exactly. Sharing those keys that should not be shared because your colleagues need them or your teammates. Yeah, as you said.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**所以，我理解的愿景基本上是：“嘿，终端已经存在很久了，这里有一些很酷的想法可以创新。” 这还是在 AI 时代之前，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like so like do I understand the vision was like basically the vision was like hey the terminal has been around forever here's a couple of cool ideas on how we can innovate and this was pre AAI right like this prei</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，但当时已经有了这个愿景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> okay we but already that that was the the vision</p>

### 艰难抉择：高增长公司 vs. 种子期梦想

**主持人：**你能谈谈这个话题吗？我觉得很少有人讨论，尤其是当你的职业生涯还处于早期，你还是个应届毕业生。好吧，你有过几次很酷的实习经历，这意味着可能有很多公司愿意雇佣你。你当时有在面试其他公司吗？还是这是你面试的第一家？你是如何考虑或进行你第一份全职工作的薪酬谈判的？因为我猜实习的时候没什么谈判空间，但这次你可能有一些余地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now can you tell me a little bit about like I feel not many people talk about this especially when you're still earlier in your career you're a new grad okay you know like you've had a couple of like really cool internships which means probably you know like a lot more companies will be open to to hiring you were you interviewing at other companies as well or was this the first one you did? And how did you think about or how did you go about like negotiating your you know your first full-time composition cuz I guess with internships you don't have much negotiation but but here you probably had some leeway.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦是的，当时所有人都想要工程师。问题是，我从未真正设想过自己会加入一家这么小的公司。当时只有两个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah, every everyone wanted engineers at the time. The thing is that I never really envisioned myself joining such a small company. It was only two people and</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**所以在我求职过程中，我的重点是关注那些 15 到 20 人的 A 轮团队。我当时有几个选择，那些公司已经有了 1000 万美元的 **ARR**（Annual Recurring Revenue: 年化经常性收入）。所以，你知道，我可以加入一个“火箭飞船”，见证快速增长，并且可以肯定会有很多机会，因为当一个公司快速增长时，需要做的事情远比人手要多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and there was no Kin. Um, so my focus during my uh job search process was focusing on uh 15 to 20 people teams series A. I had a couple options that had $10 million ARR already. So, you know, you you could I could join a rocket ship like see like fast growth and then get to know for sure that there will be a lot of opportunities because when you have a fast growth company, there's just way more things to do than there are people.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**（赞助商时间）Michelle 刚才谈到她曾有机会加入那些在 AI 时代之前就已经飞速增长的初创公司。而我今天看到的是，许多初创公司因为 AI 编程工具的帮助，增长得更快了。他们可以比以前快得多地发布功能。但如果没有衡量标准，你就不知道哪些功能在帮助增长，哪些在损害增长。当你用 AI 以 10 倍的速度发布产品时，这种不确定性会加剧。你可能在朝着更好的指标快速前进，也可能在发布更多损害转化率和留存率的功能。这就是我们的合作伙伴 Statsig 发挥作用的地方。Statsig 构建了实验和功能管理平台，为 AI 加速开发提供了护栏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michelle was just talking about how she had the option of joining startups that were growing really fast even before AI. Today, what I'm seeing is many startups are growing even faster because they can get to incredible velocity with AI coding tools. And so, they can ship features a lot faster than before. But without measurement, you don't know which features are helping and which are hurting your growth. When you're shipping 10x faster with AI, that uncertainty compounds. You could be shipping faster towards better metrics or you could be shipping more features that hurt conversion and retention. This is where our presenting partner static comes in. Static built experimentation and feature management that acts as guardrails for AI accelerated development.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**现在让我们回到 Michelle 为什么选择加入一家非常早期的初创公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now let's get back to why Tim Michelle chose to join a very early stage startup.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我确实有很多那样的选择。但自从和 Warp 的创始人 Zach 谈过之后，我每天都在思考这个产品，以及我们如何能让它变得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So I actually had a lot of those options. Um but ever since talking to Zach um the the founder of Warp, I kept thinking every day about the product and how we could make it better. Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我发现自己对这个产品充满了热情。因为当我在做软件工程实习时，我发现改进终端能带来巨大的商业影响。2018 年夏天，Slack 发生了多次宕机。那是 Slack 第一次引入像 IBM 和迪士尼这样的大型企业客户。所以，那些对初创公司客户有效的双重嵌套循环，在 IBM 和迪士尼的规模下就不再适用了。很多东西都在崩溃。很多内部工具都是通过 **CLI**（Command-Line Interface: 命令行界面）运行的，很多命令都在 Slack 上共享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And it was just a product that I had to I discovered that I had a lot of passion for because um when I was uh doing the software engineering internships, I actually found that there was a lot of uh real business impact from improving the terminal. In the summer of 2018, Slack had multiple outages. Um that was the first time that Slack was bringing on new enterprise clients like IBM and Disney. And so what you know the double nested loops that could have worked for uh selling to startups no longer worked at IBM and Disney scale. And so a lot of things were breaking. A lot of terminal comm a lot of uh internal tools were run through CLIs. A lot of commands were being shared on Slack.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你看到了潜力，比如更好地共享命令，更好的工具，甚至一个协作式的命令行界面在 Slack 内部都会很有帮助，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you were you you were seeing the potential of like how just like I know sharing commands better like better tooling a collaborative C cl C CLI even a Slack could have been helpful at your time right?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的。所以我看到了巨大的商业影响。其次，作为一个几年前才刚开始学习计算机科学的人，我个人也认为这对很多计算机科学学生来说是一个很高的入门门槛。因为对于新手来说，学习计算机科学已经很吓人了，但更吓人的是，当你试图把光标从命令中的一个字符移动到另一个字符时，发现鼠标根本不起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So I saw a huge business impact and then second I also personally as someone who just learned computer science just a few years back saw that it was a very big barrier to entry for a lot of computer science students um because computer science is already so scary um to learn for someone who's new to it um but what is even scarier is trying to move the cursor from one uh character on your command to another and realizing that the mouse doesn't work</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我觉得如果我们能让编程对每个人来说都更简单，就能产生很大的社会影响。如果我们能让终端更容易使用，如果你可以用鼠标移动光标，而不是记住 Control+A 和 Emacs 的快捷键。所以我想，好吧，这个商业想法有巨大的商业影响和潜在收入，如果我们做得好，还能让计算机科学变得更容易普及。我什么时候还能有机会作为第一位工程师加入这么酷的想法呢？我随时可以去找一份在那些年收入千万美元、每季度翻番的公司的工作，但能恰好赶上这家公司创立的窗口期，并有机会成为第一位工程师，这是非常罕见的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like I felt like there was also a lot of impact society that can be made if coding was a lot simpler for everybody. Um if we could make a terminal more accessible, if you could move the cursor with your mouse instead of memorizing control A uh and Emac shortcuts. Um so it was like okay this business idea there's a lot of business u impact and potential revenue and if we do well we can make computer science a lot more accessible like when else can I join such a cool idea as the first engineer. I could always look for a job um in any of these like $10 million ARR like doubling like every quarter things but it's so rare to kind of coincide with the window in which this company was being started and that I get the chance to be the first engineer.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**另一件事是，如果我加入其他公司，我就没有机会与一位曾在谷歌担任首席工程师的人如此紧密地合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the other thing was like in other companies if I were to join I wouldn't get the opportunity to work so closely with someone who was a principal engineer at Google.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是的，Zach 曾是谷歌的首席工程师，对吧？他是一位资深的软件工程师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, Zach was a principal Google engineer, right? Like he's a longtime software engineer.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，他还是《时代》杂志的前首席技术官。我觉得，我的一些朋友会去读硕士来提升计算机科学能力，但我在这里有机会进入“Zach 大学”，通过直接与他合作，迅速成为一名优秀的软件工程师。他会审查我所有的技术文档和代码提交请求（pull requests），我很快就成长为一名非常优秀的工程师。这就是我做决定的过程。这绝对是非常不寻常的。我本可以回到 Robin Hood，我收到了他们的录用通知。但我就是知道，我需要去一个更小的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Former CTO at Time magazine and I felt like I, you know, some of my friends would go um study masters programs to be better at computer science. But here I had this opportunity to get go through Zack University to become a really good software engineer very quickly working directly with him. He was looking through all my tag dogs, all my pull requests, and I just became a very uh good engineer very fast. That was how I made the decision. Uh it was a it was definitely very atypical. Uh like I I could have gone back to Robin Hood. I had that return offer. Um but I just knew that I needed to be somewhere a lot smaller.</p>
</details>

### 创始工程师的薪酬谈判与反向背调

**主持人：**你谈判你的薪酬了吗？尤其是在初创公司，当你早期加入一家硅谷初创公司，或者说实话，大多数有风险投资或计划进行风险投资的初创公司时，薪酬的一部分是**股权**（equity），这对大多数软件工程师来说总是一个有点棘手的话题。你是如何研究股权的？你是如何了解它的？你谈判了吗，还是直接接受了 offer 上的条件？我觉得这是一个很多人不谈论但却非常重要的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you negotiate your compensation? Especially, you know, with startups when you're joining early on in a Silicon Valley startup or or at like honestly most startups that are kind of like either have venture funding or plan venture funding, a part of composition is equity, which is always a bit tricky subject for for most software engineers. How did you research equity? How did you learn about it? Did you negotiate it or you just kind of took whatever was, you know, on the offer? because I feel this is a topic that not many people talk about but it does get pretty important right?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**为股权进行谈判非常重要。我当时为尽可能多的股权进行了激烈的谈判，而我愿意放弃的是现金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It is so important uh to to negotiate for equity. I really negotiated hard for as much equity as possible and what I was willing to trade off was cash.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你的 offer 是如何呈现的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How was your offer presented?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我收到了一个电子表格，里面有三个选项，薪水递增，股权递减。那是一个非常好的电子表格，我现在还在用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I was presented a spreadsheet that had three options uh with increasing salary and decreasing equity. It was a really good spreadsheet and I I actually use this today uh where it actually</p>
</details>

**主持人：**在你的初创公司，如果有人收到 offer，他们也会得到这样的电子表格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> at your startup if someone gets an offer they're going to get a spreadsheet like this.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，在我的公司 Flint，你会得到这个电子表格，它能帮你计算出股权在薪酬价值方面的实际意义。我们还会计算税收以及每一轮融资的稀释情况，还有一个计算器可以根据不同的结果和每种结果的可能性，帮你计算股票的期望价值。这一切都归功于 Warp 的 Zach，他允许我使用这个电子表格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes, at Flint my company you will get this spreadsheet that helps you calculate what the equity actually means in terms of the compensation value. Uh we also hand like we also calculate tax as well as dilution at every stage and then we also have this uh calculator that helps you calculate the expected uh value of your stock based on different uh outcomes and the likelihoods of each outcome. Um and all credit is to Zach from from War who let me use this uh spreadsheet.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**总之，有三个选项，我为股权最多的那个选项进行了激烈的争取，并愿意接受极低的现金。至于我有什么筹码，这可能是一个糟糕的谈判策略，但我谈判的方式是说：“嘿，Zach，我真的非常想和你一起工作。我会和你一起工作。我会签下这份 offer。我真的很想打造这个产品。我们开始吧。如果我们能用这个数字而不是那个数字，我将不胜感激。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But anyway, there are three there are three options and um I argued very hard for the one with the most equity and I was willing to go extremely low on cash. And in terms of what leverage I had, this is probably a bad negotiation strategy, but the way that I negotiated that was saying, "Hey, Zach, I actually really really want to work with you. Um, I will work with you. Um, I will sign this offer. this is I really want to build this thing. Let's go do it. I would really appreciate if we could do this off this number instead of this number.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**有人可能会说这是一个非常糟糕的谈判策略，因为你通过表明自己没有其他选择而失去了所有筹码。有人会说，提高 offer 的最佳方式是制造竞争。但我认为，在早期初创公司，当你作为第一或第二名员工加入时，你已经全身心投入、准备好、并兴奋地帮助创始人，这对他们来说意义重大。他们希望你开心，也希望确保你得到一个好的待遇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might say that that's a really bad uh negotiation strategy because you are losing all the cards by saying that you don't have any other options and uh you know some might say the best way to increase your your offer is by having competition. But I think that early stage companies um where you're joining as just like one or two people, it really means a lot to the founder that you are bought in, ready to go, excited to help them and they want you to be happy and they want to make sure that you have a good deal.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**我得说，你在网上读到的那些通用谈判建议，首先，很多都是针对与没有面孔的大公司谈判的。在那种情况下，给你 offer 的人，比如招聘经理或人力资源，他们并不拥有这家公司，他们只是被给予一些数字，他们的工作是招到人，他们没有太多情感投入。很多那样的建议会奏效。但正如你所说，在初创公司，这是人与人之间的事，是一个非常小的团队，创始人们确实在乎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say like you know the the general advice of negotiation that you read online first of all a lot of it is written when you're negotiating with against faceless corporations where the person uh giving the offer let's say an injury manager or HR they don't own this thing they're given numbers and it's they have a job to do which is close people and they have don't have too much emotion and a lot of that advice will work you know like that they do but as you say in a startup it's it's people it's a very small team the founders do care.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**有一件我听说过但很不寻常，也没人会建议的事，但你还是做了。那就是当一家公司给你 offer 时，他们通常会要求你提供推荐人。我听说你对 Warp 的 CEO Zach 做了同样的事。那是怎么发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one thing I've heard that is also atypical and no one will suggest, but you still did it, is you know when a company makes you an offer, they often ask for references for you to talk with other people or before they make an offer. I heard you did that with Zach Warp CEO. H how did that happen?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，我在这之前翻出了那封邮件，看到我当时写道：“嘿，Zach，对此感到非常兴奋。很乐意把我的推荐人发给你。我也想更多地了解你作为一名经理是怎样的。你能否给我一些你以前管理过的人的联系方式作为推荐人？尤其是当他们还是初级工程师的时候。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I actually pulled up the email before this and I saw that I said like, "Hey, Zach, really excited about this. Um, happy to send you my ref checks." Um I would also like to learn more about how you are as a manager. Can you send me a reference uh references for people that you have managed before? Um especially when they were junior engineer.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**我其实会建议每个人都这么做。人们常说，你离开的不是公司，而是经理。在初创公司，你无法选择你的经理，也无法离开一个团队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean I I would recommend everyone to to do this actually. They say like you you don't leave companies, you leave managers. Um and uh at a startup you can't pick your manager, you can't leave a team. Like my</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的。我在谷歌工作的朋友如果在一个团队里过得不开心，他们可以换到另一个团队。但在初创公司，你和那个经理是绑定的。所以你需要尽可能多地了解和他们一起工作会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Like my friends working at Google could be having a bad time with one team and then they could switch to another team. At a startup you are married to that manager. So you need to learn as much as possible about what it would be like working with them.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**顺便说一下，背景调查是任何面试过程中最重要的部分，有时甚至比现场面试本身更重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um you have like reference checks are by the way the most important part of any interview process. Like that is like sometimes even more important than the on-site itself.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**在你现在的初创公司，你也在做背景调查吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at your current startup, you're also doing reference checks.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**一直都做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Always,</p>
</details>

**主持人：**那么现在，作为一个创始人，你在背景调查中看重什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And what do you look in a reference check now? Just kind of, you know, thinking a little bit from a founder,</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**作为创始人，在评估候选人时，我问的最重要的问题是：“你愿意再次和这个人一起工作吗？” 我寻找的答案不是“愿意”，而是“当然愿意！我甚至不知道你为什么要问我这个问题。你能得到这个人真是太幸运了。我不知道你们公司发生了什么，但你怎么能招到这样的人才？” 这才是我想要的答案。如果我听到的是“哦，是的，我觉得他们会很棒”或者“是的，他们很强”，那对我来说就是一个不合格的背景调查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> if I as a founder, I'm evaluating a candidate. Um, the most important question I ask is, would you want to work with this person again? And the answer I'm looking for is not yes. The answer I'm looking for is hell yes. I I don't even know like why you even asking me this question. Like you're so lucky to have this person like I don't know what's happening in the waters of your company but like how are you able to pull someone like this? That is what I'm looking for. Um if I'm hearing like a oh like yeah I think that they could be great or like yeah they're very strong. Um that to me is like a bad reference check that does not pass my my test.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**在我的背景调查中，很重要的一点是了解年轻和初级的员工能获得多少机会。职业发展对话是怎样的？晋升是如何运作的？在困难时期情况如何？Zach 通过了所有的考验。我与两位曾为 Zach 工作的实习生/新工程师交谈，他们很快就成为了 Google Sheets 的工程总监。所以，他显然是一个会押注于年轻人才并帮助他们晋升的人。我在 Warp 也一次又一次地看到了这一点，很多年轻的应届毕业生被赋予了技术负责人或负责 Warp 最关键项目流的职位，因为 Zach 总是押注于年轻人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it was really important in my reference check to check how much opportunity did someone young and junior get like what were career conversations like? How did promotions work? What was it like during the tough times? Um and Zach passed like exceeded all of the tests in that I talked to two engineers that were new/in interns working for Zach and then very quickly became director of engineering at uh Google Sheets. Um, so he was clearly someone who would bet on young talent and then help to promote them. Um, and I saw that again again at at Warp where a lot of uh younger new grads were given positions of tech lead or being able to uh run the most critical uh project streams at Warp because Zach always bets on the young talent.</p>
</details>

### 创始工程师的真实生活：从 TypeScript 到 Rust

**主持人：**当你加入 Warp 时，你主要使用了哪些技术？你是如何找到自己的技术栈或定位的？因为你后来谈到，在初创公司或科技公司里，有偏向产品、偏向基础架构、偏向前端和偏向后端的不同角色。你最终定位在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you joined warp uh what kind of technologies did you work on and how did you find your so-called kind of stack or place because you later talked about how you know in startups or in tech companies there's kind of like more product and more infrastructure more front end more more backend where did you end up in this sense</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**Warp 的技术栈最初是用 TypeScript 开始的。然后过了两三个月，我们决定废弃那个代码库，用 Rust 重建所有东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so the stack at warp actually first started out with JavaScript and then within oh it was TypeScript and then uh two to three months in we decided to scrap that repository and rewrite every just like rebuild everything in rust.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**我必须问为什么，尽管我大概能猜到原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I have to ask why although I I suspect why.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，是为了性能，也是为了开发速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So it was for performance reasons and it was also speed of development.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**虽然用 JavaScript 写代码很快，但我们需要花费大量周期来对其进行压力测试，以满足各种性能限制。我用我们的 JavaScript 应用做了一个测试，画了一千个矩形，然后开始滚动终端，结果滚动就卡顿了。对我们来说，能够绘制大量矩形至关重要，因为终端会输出大量日志，所有东西都必须非常快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So um while it was really fast to push out JavaScript code, we then needed to spend a lot of cycles testing stress testing it against um a lot of performance constraints. So, one thing I did with our JavaScript app was that I drew a thousand rectangles um and then I started scrolling the terminal and the scrolling was breaking. Um and it's extremely important for us to be able to draw a lot of rectangles because yeah like terminals output a lot of a lot of uh logs and everything needs to to to be really fast.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**在开发者中也有一种非常强烈的情绪，他们只愿意使用底层构建的高性能终端。所以，即使有两个功能完全相同的应用，但如果一个是 Rust 构建的，它就会传播得更好，人们会更喜欢它。当时 Rust 社区虽然小，但增长非常快，而且极其热情。所以，为了市场营销，用 Rust 构建也非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was also a very strong sentiment amongst amongst developers that they would only use uh high performance terminals that were built low level. So even if there were two applications that were completely identical but one was built in Rust, it would just be distributed a lot better, people would love it, people would uh you had this at back time back then like the Rust community was was small but growing very fast and extremely passionate. And so it was also very important for marketing that we built it in Rust.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**当我们决定用 Rust 重写时，发生了一件很有趣的事。Zach 给每个人都寄了 O'Reilly 的 Rust 书。所以我和另一位创始工程师每天都在读书，每当我们学到新东西，就会说：“哦，我们重写一下之前写的代码吧。” 我们还有幸与 Nathan Sobo 合作，他是 Atom 编辑器的发明者，后来创办了 Zed。他有丰富的 Rust 经验，每天都和我结对编程，我学到了所有真正好用的 Rust 编程范式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was very really uh funny when we decided to do to uh beat and rust and then um Zach sent the O'Reilly Rust book to every um everybody. So me the founding engine uh the other founding engineer a log and he and then we would just read every day and then every time we learn something new we're like oh let's rewrite what we wrote previously. There are way too many unwraps um so let's go fix that. We also had the privilege of uh working with uh Nathan Sobo who was uh the inventor of the Atom um editor and then eventually started Zad and he had a lot of Rust experience and every day he would pair program with me and I just learned all of the Rust um idioms that work really well.</p>
</details>

### 产品工程师 vs. 基础架构工程师

**主持人：**我猜结对编程确实有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I guess pair programming does work.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦是的。你之前问过关于产品工程与基础架构工程的问题。很多年前，在“产品工程师”这个词还没普及之前，我就写过一篇文章。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah. Um, I really enjoyed pair programming with Nathan uh because I learned a lot of like small ergonomical things that makes a big difference in in using the IDE. You asked a question earlier about like product engineering versus infrastructure engineering. Um, and I wrote a piece like many many years ago before the word product engineer even became uh in everyone's lexicon.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**产品工程和“产品优先”的编码者，是那些更受用户问题驱动、对解决用户影响感到兴奋的人。他们将技术视为实现用户影响的手段。而“代码优先”的人，则更倾向于基础架构工程，他们对最佳性能、最好的库和代码的优雅性感到兴奋。

<p class="english-text">product engineering and product first coding are like people who are more motivated by user problems and excited about solving the user impact and then they see technology as a means to an ends of user impact and then there's like the codef first people who tend to more map onto to infrastructure engineering where they're really excited about like you know the best performance the best libraries elegance</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**通过在 Robin Hood 的实习，我发现自己骨子里是一个产品工程师。我发现，用产品工程与基础架构工程来划分工程师，比用前端和后端来划分要好得多。因为人们的思维模式大致可以分为两类：一类是“产品优先”的人，他们关心用户影响，进入计算机科学领域是因为它能为人们做些什么；另一类是“代码优先”的人，他们对代码本身和挑战代码极限感到兴奋，这些人更倾向于解决基础架构问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I found through my Robin Robin Hood internship that I very much am like a product engineer at heart um and I find that this division of product versus infrastructure engineering is a way better split to think about engineering than front end and back end. Um because of the mental models of like people tend to segment into like roughly speaking two camps. So the product first people who care about user impact, they gone into computer science because of the things that computer science can do for people and then the second camp which is code first people who are really excited about the code itself and really excited about pushing the limits of of code and they tend to map to more infrastructural problems.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**当我真正有机会加入 Robin Hood 的新闻标签页团队后，我终于发现，我真的非常热爱解决用户问题。在解决用户问题的同时，我可以使用后端和前端等工具，具体用哪个对我来说并不重要，只要我能解决用户的核心问题，即“我应该看到什么新闻，以及它应该是什么样子”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it was only after I got that opportunity and I I I I advocated for joining the news tab team, the Robin Hood news team that I finally saw like wo like I actually really love so solving user impact problems and user problems and then while solving the user problems I get to use tools like back end and front end and it didn't matter to me which one I was using as long as I was solving the problem of like the user which is what news do I see and how does it look</p>
</details>

**主持人：**作为一名创始人，我猜你未来某个时候也会招聘产品工程师。除了基本的编码能力，你会看重哪些特质来判断一个人是否适合产品工程？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a founder yourself, I assume at some point you will hire product engineers if you're not already hiring. But what would you look for like outside of the like this person can code and you know has the basics, but what what what are the things that will tell you if like okay this person would be good at product engineering versus just maybe not as much.</p>
</detais>

**Michelle：**一个关键信号是他们是否曾在本质上是“产品优先”的公司工作过。比如，如果他们曾在 Figma、Notion 或 Slack 这样面向用户的 SaaS 工具公司工作，你就知道这些公司非常注重产品优先的思维，并且他们选择的员工也是产品优先的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One key signal is whether or not they have worked for a company that was product first in nature. Like if they had worked on uh more of like a userfacing type of SAS tool like Figma, notion or Slack um you know that those companies are very focused on product first thinking and they pick people who are product first.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**在面试中你也能看出来。当你问他们在之前的工作中做了什么时，有些人会大谈特谈那些很酷的技术，而另一些人则会关注业务问题，比如：“我们每年在亚马逊上浪费了 70 万美元，所以我们必须迁移到自己托管的开源 Presto 上。” 他们会从用户的角度来谈论问题，并且能够根据用户可见的里程碑来规划产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but then in an interview uh you can also kind of of tell based on how the candidate answers questions. So when you ask them um what they were doing uh some pe at their previous uh roles uh some people will focus a lot on like the really cool technology and then others will focus on the business problem of like oh like you know we were leaking $700,000 a year to Amazon. Um and so it was very important that we migrated over to our own open source hosted presto and then we did this and then this is what happened to the business. um as opposed to like oh like you know it was very important for us to do this thing and it was very difficult because of XYZ reasons and then we used this library but then this library didn't work you know you could really tell the difference and it was very important also for our interview process to involve a product round where we asked uh people like you know what would they change about the terminal what would they change about a favorite app that they're already using and then the best people who are thinking in terms of product would know how well first of all would have an opinion about how how to improve a product and then second of all would know how to talk about it from the users uh perspective and last of all are able to create milestones in that product based on user visible milestones.</p>
</details>

### 从创始工程师到创始人

**主持人：**你当过创始工程师，现在是创始人。显然你也在招聘创始工程师。你认为产品工程师和创始工程师有何不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So you've you've been a founding engineer, you're now a founder. Clearly you're also hiring founding engineers and at Warp you also hired product engineers. How do you think a product engineer versus a founding engineer differs or or do they is it just the timing or is it also a little bit of different personality or different kind of challenges?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**这是个好问题。我想说，创始工程师和产品工程师是不同维度上的概念。你可以是创始产品工程师，也可以是创始基础架构工程师。或者你可以是后期阶段的产品工程师、后期阶段的基础架构工程师等等。我认为，如果你是在公司成立头几个月内加入的前五名左右的员工，就可以算作创始工程师。而产品工程师，在我的定义里，是热衷于解决用户问题，并且能够全栈实现解决方案的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that's a very good question. Um, so I would say like founding engineer versus product engineer, they're like different exes. So you could be a founding product engineer. Uh, you could be a founding infrastructure engineer. Um um or you could be like a later stage product engineer, later stage infrastructure engineer, um later later stage uh software engineer, uh AI engineer. Um I think that folks might differ on the definition, but I think founding engineer counts if you are in the first five or so that joins within the first few months of the company starting. A product engineer in my definition is someone who is excited about solving uh user problems and they are full stack in being able to do that.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**在你现在的初创公司 Flint，你们使用 AI 的程度如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At your current startup how much are at Flint? How much are you using AI?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦，一直都在用。现在使用 AI 编码几乎成了一项要求，因为这样你能更高效。我们总是在用 Claude。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, um, all the time. Like it's almost a requirement at this point to use AI to code. Uh, cuz then you can be more productive. Always cloud code.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你还用 IDE 吗？还是不怎么用了，只用来审查代码？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you still use the ID or not as much or to re review stuff?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我们在 IDE 内部使用 Claude。我们用的是 Cursor，还有一个工程师只在 Vim 上编码，所以他在 Vim 上用 Claude。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, we use cloud code inside the IDE. Inside VS Code or or I'm not sure if you can do cursor or one of them. It's cursor and then we have an engineer who only codes on Vim. So he uses cloud code on Vim.</p>
</details>

### AI 创业潮中的风险与机遇

**主持人：**你之前提到了一些警示故事，关于加入早期初创公司，尤其是 AI 初创公司时，一些工程师可能会感觉被创始人“坑”了。现在 AI 初创公司和创始人都呈爆炸式增长，你看到或听说过哪些负面模式，以及如何避免它们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One interesting topic that you mentioned earlier is some cautionary tales about how when you're joining an early stage startup, especially an AI startup, some engineers can feel a little bit like screwed by founders and and you know I I I think you know we talked about how you managed to like you know get a great offer at an AI company with a a founder who like checked all the boxes but I think it's important to talk about some negative patterns you might have seen or heard and and how to avoid it because again there's an explosion of startups of AI startups of founders uh who want to recruit engineers and sometimes I guess uh things can be too good to be true.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，我从朋友那里也感受到了很多。人们特别担心创始人可能会被大公司**人才收购**（acquihired: 指公司收购的主要目的是获得其员工，而非产品或服务），然后成为公司里唯一从这笔交易中获得金钱利益的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. I I I'm sensing a lot amongst my friends as well that people feel like um specifically uh the founder might be acquihired away uh by a bigger company and then be the only one in the company that received any monetary benefit from</p>
</details>

**主持人：**是的，我们已经在新闻里看到过一些创始人被挖走，而团队却被晾在一边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so that that we've seen in in the news. Some of the founders being hired away and then the team is left hanging.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**这正是人们非常害怕的具体情景。我有个朋友告诉我，因为所有这些创始人的股权收购事件，她决定干脆加入 OpenAI，因为那里更安全。我认为关键在于真正了解创始人的品格。一个很好的了解创始人的方法就是做背景调查。这个人品格好吗？对员工慷慨吗？关心团队吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That is the specific scenario that people are really scared of. And I actually had a friend who told me that because of all these um equity hires of the founders that's happening like she's just she's just going to to join OpenAI instead because it's safe. I think it's all about uh really understanding the character of the founder. One great way to find out about the founder is to do reference checks like is this yeah is this someone who actually has good character who is generous with their people who care about their team.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**另一个很好的判断标准是看创始人自己是否也曾是创始工程师。因为那种亲身经历和同理心，是你除非也经历过成为创始工程师的洗礼，否则无法获得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the other good pro uh approximator is to see if the founder themselves were founding engineers to begin with because that's just like that lived experience and empathy that you just cannot get unless you went through the um the ritual of having been a founding engineer where you're in there.</p>
</details>

### Flint 的愿景：构建自主优化的智能网站

**主持人：**说到你的初创公司 Flint，你能谈谈你是如何想到围绕网站这个点子的吗？以及你认为这些 AI 代理将如何改变世界和网络？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Speaking of which, uh, your your your startup Flint, C, can we talk about how you came up with the idea around websites and also how you know both what you're building but also how you're thinking these AI agents will change the world, the web.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**网站本身将变得具有代理性（agentic），它们会自我构建。这意味着，如果你早上醒来发现竞争对手连夜推出了新产品，你的网站可能已经为你生成了一个对比页面，将你与竞争对手进行比较，并且已经在优化转化率，同时每天跟踪你和他们产品之间的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the website itself become agentic. They build themselves. That means um that if you wake up in the morning to a competitor having launched overnight, your website would have already generated you a comparison page that compares you with the competitor and then it's already optimizing for conversions and it's also keeping track of the differences in your product and them every day and then updating it.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**过去需要五个代理机构花三个月才能完成的事情，现在在你睡觉的时候一夜之间就完成了。我们还考虑自动化所有其他相关的营销工作流程。比如，我们可以接入你的销售电话和 Gong 的通话记录，然后找出你可能缺失的销售产品或解决方案页面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So something that would have taken five agencies three months to do suddenly gets done overnight when you were sleeping. And we're thinking of also automating all of the other marketing workflows around that. Like we can hook into your sales calls and your gong calls and then find out ways of selling your product or solution pages that you might be missing.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**哇，这真是下一个级别的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh wow. this is proper next level.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，我们正在为网络带来自主性。我们正在构建一种新的互联网，网站不仅由 AI 生成、为 AI 服务，而且它本身也正在变成 AI，变得更动态、更主动。我的联合创始人曾在自动驾驶汽车公司 Neuro 负责团队，我们经常讨论自主网站与自动驾驶汽车的相似之处。它们都通过感知系统接收数据，然后有一个决策系统来决定该做什么，最后通过一个控制系统来实际执行页面构建。通过将所有这些感知、决策和控制系统整合到同一个实体中，我们最终闭合了反馈循环。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um it is uh bringing autonomy to the to the web. we we're really building a new kind of uh internet here where uh the website is now not only generated by AI and for AI but it's also becoming AI itself um to be more dynamic and proactive um um my co-founder actually ran teams at Neuro which is an autonomous vehicle company and we talk a lot about how autonomous websites are similar to autonomous vehicles in that it does they they take in data through a perception system. Then there's a decision-m system about okay like based on this comp competitor based on these sales calls like what should we do and then it would then have a control system that then actually implements the pages and then it would then start off that loop again where based on how the page is doing in the environment which is the market what should we then do? So by putting all of that perception, that decision-m and control uh systems into the same entity, we finally close the feedback loop.</p>
</details>

### 给未来创始工程师的建议

**主持人：**对于那些希望作为创始工程师加入 AI 初创公司或快速增长的初创公司的软件工程师，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So what would your advice be to software engineers who would love to join as a founding engineer maybe an AI startup or a fast grow startup these days a lot of them are AI not all of them uh if if if it's someone who you know has some experience in the field what tactics you think might work for them</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**关键在于展示你曾经构建过 AI 产品，因为这项技能现在需求量很大，而且非常新。相对而言，很少有人真正构建过 AI 产品。所以，只要花一些周末时间，学习如何构建一个 AI 产品，就能让你在众多人中脱颖而出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it's about uh showing that you've built in AI before cuz that skill is very much high in in demand and it's very new Very few people relatively speaking and have ever built an AI product before. So just spending like some time over weekends knowing how to build an AI product already helps you stand out above many people.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**在那个职位上要取得成功，首先要选择对的创始人。但一旦你加入了，关键就在于主动去做那些没人想做，但对业务最重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of excelling in that role, it starts off with picking the right founder. Um but then once you do join, it's all about volunteering to do the things that uh no one no one wants to do, but it's the most important thing for the business.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我做过大多数工程师会认为是最糟糕的工作，那就是在 Warp 担任公司在 Hacker News 上的代言人。我写博客文章，把它们发布在 Hacker News 上，并回答上面的所有问题。我还创建了公司的 Twitter 账号并撰写推文，为公司开设了 YouTube 频道，创建了 Discord 频道，整理所有反馈，启动了 GitHub 项目——这些都是工程之外但业务非常需要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so I did what most engineers would consider to be the worst job ever, which is to be the face of the company on Hacker News at Warp. So I wrote the blog posts, I published them on on Hacker News and I answered all the questions on on Hacker News. Um, I went out there and I created our company Twitter and I was writing tweets for the company. Then starting a YouTube channel for the for the company before any developer tool companies really thought about doing YouTube. starting a discord channel like filing every feedback starting the GitHub like things that like very different like outside of engineering but the business really needed</p>
</details>

**主持人：**而且你还在做你的工程工作，对吧？你还在修复 bug 等等，但在此之上，你还在想办法帮助公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and and then you still doing your engineering job you're still like you know like fixing bug and etc but on on the top of it that you're figuring out how to help the company right</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**是的，你仍然要确保做好你的首要工作，也就是软件工程。只有在你的主业已经做得很好的情况下，才应该主动去做其他事情。做这些事情的好处是，你能学到企业需要什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah yeah you you still have to make sure that you're doing your your number one job which is software engineering so that needs to still stay the main focus and you should only volunteer for other stuff if you are already doing well in your main job. The benefit of doing a lot of these things and learning how to do a lot of these things um is that then um you get to learn um what businesses need.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**有一次，因为我做了所有这些事情，还招聘了所有增长团队的人，我记得在一次董事会会议后，我的创始人找到我说：“嘿，Michelle，你招聘了所有这些增长团队的人，我希望你来担任增长负责人，从现在开始，你将负责组建和管理这个团队。”我当时大概 22 岁，突然就成了高管，突然要每季度向董事会汇报数字和收入。除非你主动去做那些没人愿意做的杂事，否则你不会得到这样的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at one point because I was doing all these things and then hiring all the people I remember like it was after one of the board meetings my my founder reached out to me and said that hey like Michelle like you hired all these people in growth I want you to be head of growth you're going to be starting and managing this team from now on and I don't know I was like 22 at the time and suddenly executive suddenly reporting to the board every quarter on that like wow wow numbers and revenue you wouldn't get that uh unless you volunteer to do random things.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**最终，我甚至开始负责 Warp 的企业销售。因为我们遇到了一个问题，开始收到很多使用 Warp 的公司的安全调查问卷。我看到这个问题时想，哦，这不是一个安全问题，这是一个企业销售的机会。这是一个对话的开始，如果我们有企业级协议，我们就可以填写你们的调查问卷，提供 SOC 2 报告和所有这些合规控制及管理面板，只要你们付给我们相应的费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Eventually I ended up leading enterprise sales for warp. Um because we had this problem where we started getting a lot of security questionnaires from companies that were using warp and I saw that problem and I was like oh this is not a security problem. This is an enterprise sales opportunity. This is the start of a conversation in which if we have an enterprise deal we could we could fill your questionnaires and we could have sock to reports and we could have all these nice compliance controls and admin panel if you paid us like you know this amount of money.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**正是做这些非常不光鲜、没人愿意做的事情，才能真正帮助你在公司里脱颖而出。因为不知不觉中，你可能就因为没人愿意处理安全调查问卷而开始负责企业销售了。那是个烫手山芋，在多个季度里被传来传去，直到传到我手里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's things like this that really help you um do well in a company. It's doing the things that are very unsexy that nobody wants to do because before you know it, you might be running enterprise sales because no one no one wanted to work on security questionnaires. It was a hot potato that was passed around multiple quarters until it went to me.</p>
</details>

### 快问快答

**主持人：**作为结束，我们来做一些快速问答。我问一个问题，你告诉我你首先想到的是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> as closing let's just do some rapid questions. I'm going to ask a question and then you tell me what comes to mind. Sounds good.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**好的，听起来很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that sounds great.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你最喜欢的编程语言是什么，为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What's your favorite programming language and why?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**哦，Rust。每次通过借用检查器（borrow checker）时，我都会感到非常满足，因为写出能编译通过的代码非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, Rust. I feel like I get a lot of satisfaction every time I pass through borrow checker cuz it's very difficult to write code that compiles.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**在 Flint，你们也用 Rust 吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And at Flint, you use Rust as well.</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**Flint 是一个 TypeScript 技术栈的公司。我们正在构建自主网站，以及能够自我构建的网站，所以用一种能够构建网站的语言会很有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh Flint, we are a TypeScript shop. We are building autonomous websites and we're building uh websites that build themselves with like you know so it is helpful to be writing in a language that builds the website.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**你有什么推荐的一两部电影吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What are one or two movies that you would recommend that you enjoyed?</p>
</details>

**Michelle：**我非常喜欢《Weapons》。它表面上看起来像一部恐怖电影，但实际上非常有趣。里面有很多喜剧元素，我也很喜欢它的非线性叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I really enjoyed uh Weapons. It looks like a horror movie on the outside, but it is very enjoyable. Um there are many uh comedic moments in it and I also really enjoyed the nonlinear narrative.</p>
</details>

**主持人：**Michelle，感谢你来到我们的播客。看到你作为一名创始工程师能学到这么多，以及如何做到这一点，并最终创办自己的公司，用 Flint 做着超级激动人心的事情，这真的很有趣。祝你好运，祝 Flint 一切顺利，感谢你的到来。
