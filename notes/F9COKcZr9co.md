### 宜家：全球家居的标志性品牌

主持人 Nicola Tangen（挪威主权财富基金**Norges Bank Investment Management**的首席执行官）向大家问好，并表示非常高兴能邀请到宜家（**IKEA**: 瑞典知名跨国居家用品零售企业）的首席执行官 Jesper Brodin。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everybody. I'm Nicola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm really thrilled to welcome Yesp Burin, the CEO of IKEA.</p>
</details>

她指出，宜家以其标志性的蓝黄门店而闻名，这些门店改变了全球无数家庭的客厅，每年吸引近9亿访客，将斯堪的纳维亚设计带入千家万户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I as you know runs this iconic blue and yellow stores that had that have transformed perhaps your living room but for sure homes worldwide and they brought a slice of Scandinavian design to almost 900 million visitors every year.</p>
</details>

Jesper Brodin 对有机会参与这个播客表示感谢，并开玩笑说主持人已经为宜家做了广告，省去了他的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for the opportunity uh Nikolai to be part of uh this uh incredible podcast and and thank you for doing the commercial for IKEA so I don't have to.</p>
</details>

### 宜家门店体验：从问候到购物袋的精心设计

Nicola 提议两人像顾客一样进入宜家门店，并询问首先会看到什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would love just to go uh visiting a store with you. So can we just uh put on our customer hat and let's go into any store. So we enter the door. What is the first thing we see?</p>
</details>

Jesper Brodin 回答说，这很有趣，因为他曾有幸与宜家创始人 Ingvar Kamprad（英格瓦·坎普拉德）密切合作多年，并意识到在宜家门店中，一切都经过精心设计，没有什么是偶然的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing it's actually it's interesting since I had the pleasure uh to work very close to Invampra our founder uh for many years walking a store with him I realized that there is nothing um left to chance so to say.</p>
</details>

他指出，顾客进入宜家时首先会遇到的是一位工作人员。在人工智能和数字革命的时代，宜家仍然坚信没有什么能取代人与人之间初次见面时的问候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So the first thing you will actually experience coming to IKEA is a person. Um in a time of AI and digital revolution, it could be quite interesting that we believe that nothing can replace that human uh first impression when you somebody greets you.</p>
</details>

这位工作人员还会递给顾客一个购物袋，这是 Ingvar 的一个洞察：如果宜家提供购物袋，顾客会更早开始购物。这既是一种友好的姿态，也是宜家一个聪明的商业策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and that somebody will also hand you a bag which was Ingvar's of course insight that if we hand out bags um you will begin your shopping even sooner. So that is both uh a friendly gesture and a smart commercial uh trick from IKEA.</p>
</details>

Nicola 补充说，这些购物袋可不是小袋子，而是那些标志性的蓝色大袋子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And these are not small bags. These are pretty big ones, right? The blue the blue ones.</p>
</details>

Jesper 解释说，顾客在店内使用黄色购物袋，离开时会换成蓝色购物袋。这些蓝色购物袋已经成为标志性产品，在全球数亿家庭中被用作搬运物品、洗衣袋等。他甚至知道一些职业网球运动员在比赛时也会使用它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the blue bags have um uh we use the yellow bags when you are inside the store and then you replace it with blue when you when you leave. The blue bags have become iconic and I think in hundreds of millions of households they serve for moving things as laundry bags and whatnot. Um uh I even know that some of the professional tennis players of the world use them when they go to their center courts for games and so forth. So it's an iconic IKEA product for sure.</p>
</details>

### 宜家门店的策略性布局与信息传递

Jesper 接着介绍了顾客在宜家门店中会注意到的其他方面。在入口处，宜家会传递几个信息：首先是关于食物，因为顾客通常远道而来，而“空腹无法达成好的交易”。因此，宜家鼓励顾客在餐厅用餐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what are some of the other things that we should we should note? We we go through this maze right at the entrance. We we try to say a couple of uh send a couple of messages. One message is around food because um uh typically our customers have traveled uh from somewhere and we know for sure that you don't make good business deals on an empty stomach. So we want to promote the opportunity to actually spend some time in a restaurant.</p>
</details>

如果顾客带着孩子，可以将他们送到儿童乐园（**Småland**: 宜家门店内的儿童游乐区），让孩子们在父母购物时尽情玩耍。顾客还会看到关于家居生活和家具布置的灵感展示，以及宜家传递的低价信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you have the opportunity to if you bring your kids to actually uh uh drop them off in the small land area which is like the haven for kids to play and have fun while while the parents are looking for things for the home. Uh you would definitely see some inspiration around life at home and home furnishing. uh you would see a strong message around low price that we would send and today these days you would always uh see messages around how we try to show up as a company in in terms of being people and planet positive and uh so around sustainability. So these are some of the messages.</p>
</details>

如今，宜家还会传递关于公司如何致力于“以人为本，善待地球”和可持续发展的理念。在购物结束时，顾客会看到一些“令人震惊的廉价”商品，以提醒他们在离开前宜家产品的超高性价比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now at the end you then have some kind of shockingly cheap offer to remind everybody before you leave that you are super cheap. I guess I I I think you're using amazing words here. Shockingly, we we sometimes say uh uh tapa undone predictive which means breathtaking items. So we try to promote um low price at the beginning but for IKEA it's it's a an interesting thing because um our job is not really to be cheap. We we serve people with thin wallets out there.</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为“令人震惊”这个词用得很好，他有时会用“令人惊叹的商品”来形容。他强调，宜家的工作并非仅仅是“廉价”，而是为那些预算有限的人提供服务。宜家不仅讲述低价的故事，更讲述产品是如何制造的，其中融入了哪些可持续发展理念，以及产品的功能和质量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we always try to say is a story about not only the low price but how we made it, what are the built-in sustainability around it, uh the functions, the quality items and so on. So, it's hopefully not just a good offer, but actually a story around it.</p>
</details>

### 宜家肉丸：全球餐饮巨头与可持续发展倡议

Nicola 问宜家每年销售多少肉丸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many meatballs do you sell a year?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，肉丸销量非常大，宜家实际上是全球最大的食品公司之一。他回忆起2013或2014年，宜家审视了其食品业务（作为主要产品线的补充部分），并意识到宜家在食品销售、顾客健康和可持续发展方面都拥有相当大的影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. It's a lot of meatballs. We We are one of the actually one of the big u food um companies of the world. It's interesting because I I recall back in it must have been back in 2013 or 14. We took a look at ourselves when it comes to food, which is a complimentary part of our offer and not the primary one. And we realized with the help of some big organizations that we actually have an quite auh food footprint both when it comes to sales uh customers but also when it comes to uh health aspects and sustainability aspects.</p>
</details>

他指出，这正是宜家开始提供植物基、更健康替代品的原因。他认为，宜家可能是全球最大的肉丸销售商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I know for a fact this was the starting point for us to actually start the journey towards also offering plant based more healthy alternatives and so forth. Um but we are probably the biggest seller of meat bones in the world I would say.</p>
</details>

### 宜家的“民主设计”理念：功能、质量、形式、可持续与低价

Nicola 提到“人人负担得起的设计”听起来很简单，但为什么没有人能复制宜家的成功？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I suspect now um affordable design for everybody. It sounds pretty simple, right? But um why has nobody managed to replicate what you do?</p>
</details>

Jesper 承认有很多优秀的公司正在尝试，但这是一个非常棘手的任务。宜家有一个被称为“**民主设计**”（Democratic Design: 宜家独特的产品设计理念，强调功能、质量、形式、可持续性和低价的平衡）的设计公式，它代表了五个方面：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think there are a lot of good companies out there who who try it. But I I it's an interesting question because um it is definitely a very tricky uh task what we're trying to achieve. So we have this um formula of design which we call democratic design. So that represents five things.</p>
</details>

1.  **功能**：宜家致力于产品的实用性，例如折叠椅、储物单元等，这些产品在家庭生活中，尤其是在小空间中，真正能发挥作用。
    <details>
    <summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
    <p class="english-text">It represents function. So at IKEA, we sort so to say committed to do things functionally. Folding chairs, storage units, things that truly work for uh for people in in life at home, not at least in small spaces.</p>
    </details>
2.  **质量**：宜家非常注重质量，通过了解家庭的真实需求来设计产品。例如，宜家只销售可清洗沙发套的沙发。
    <details>
    <summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
    <p class="english-text">Um there's a great commitment to quality where we uh you know where we work uh through understanding uh true family's needs. We only sell sofas with washable covers for instance and so forth. So quality is the second uh uh um dimension.</p>
    </details>
3.  **形式**：宜家决定采用斯堪的纳维亚风格，产品通常简洁大方，既有传统风格也有现代风格。
    <details>
    <summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
    <p class="english-text">The third dimension or there is no real numbers to them but a third dimension is about form where we then have decided to take uh Scandinavian look on things. So we do have traditional things we do have more modern things but we we have our particular Scandinavian point of view on how we think things should look like uh typically quite simplistic.</p>
    </details>
4.  **可持续性**：这主要体现在产品的制造方式上，关注对人与地球的影响。
    <details>
    <summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
    <p class="english-text">fourth dimension sustainability which says a lot about how the product was made uh in relation to people and planet.</p>
    </details>
5.  **低价**：所有这些特点都以低廉的价格呈现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then you have all of these at a low price.</p>
</details>

Jesper 强调，要实现这些产品特性的结合，规模是必不可少的。同时，还需要大量的工程知识，以更智能的方式制造产品。他认为许多竞争对手做得很好，但宜家致力于为每件产品进行设计，以证明“不必富有也能聪明”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the things that is required is definitely scale in order to so to say achieve all these um um uh identities in a product. Um but it requires a lot of knowledge from an engineering point of view to actually build things in a smarter way. So again, I think a lot of competitors do do a good job, but IKEA is dedicated for every product to try to actually design it in a way to prove that you don't you don't have to be rich to be smart.</p>
</details>

### 产品策略与“平板包装”的起源

Nicola 询问宜家通常有多少种产品，以及有多少是长期存在的“常青款”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we were to uh just spend a few uh minutes on the products, how many products do you typically have? So we typically have some between some nine and 10,000 products to offer in any given market. And how many would be uh there for a long period of time? How much do you change and how much would be kind of evergreens?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，宜家在任何市场通常提供9000到10000种产品。目前，宜家每年会更换约20%的产品。其中大约一半是纺织品的颜色更新或技术和质量改进，而至少10%是全新的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we we actually change about 20% of our products annually right now. I would say approximately half of that would be color updates of textiles or it might even be you know products that we do we learn things and we do improvements technically quality wise and so forth and then but at least 10% will be uh entirely new products at the same time.</p>
</details>

Nicola 接着问，像**Billy**（比利: 宜家最畅销的书柜系列）、**Klippan**（克利潘: 宜家经典沙发系列）这样的经典产品有多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how many of these kind of uh totally classic things like the billy bouquets and so on what kind of how many of those do you have?</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，宜家约有20%的产品属于“顶尖系列”或“关键产品”。**Billy** 确实是宜家经久不衰的产品之一，还有**Poäng**（波昂: 宜家经典扶手椅）、许多储物单元、厨房单元和**PAX**（帕克斯: 宜家衣柜系统）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in our range we have approximately you can say 20% of our range would be top families as we call them or key products in IKEA. Uh you're right Billy is definitely one of the longlasting uh products in IKEA. Um you have clip uh you have armshare and you have uh quite a number of storage units as well. Uh we have our kitchen unit our packs wardrobes and so on.</p>
</details>

他指出，即使是这些产品也会不断更新，进行颜色和改进。例如，宜家最古老的产品之一 **PAX** 衣柜最近进行了重新设计，现在只需5分钟即可组装完成，而以前需要两个人花25分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nevertheless these products are also updated. There are cali changes, there are improvements to it. The PAX wardrobe in IKEA, which is one of the oldest products, has recently been remade. So instead of being two people for 25 minutes to assemble a wardrobe, you can actually click it together in 5 minutes.</p>
</details>

Nicola 开玩笑地问 Jesper 家里是否只有宜家家具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you only have IKEA furniturees at home? Now, now I start to sound like a salesperson. I real but you learned me in there. Uh, no, I don't only have IKA products. I I have a lot of IKEA products uh in in my home for sure, but not only.</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说他家里有很多宜家产品，但并非全部。他接着解释了“**平板包装家具**”（flat-pack furniture: 拆卸成平板状包装以便运输和储存的家具）的概念是如何产生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where did the uh concept of flat pack uh furniture come about? Well, it it's been argued who was the inventor of the flat pack, but definitely this goes way back to the early days of IKEA.</p>
</details>

他提到，宜家创始人 Ingvar Kamprad 和首位设计师 Gilis Lung（吉利斯·隆）在设计一张沙发边桌时，意识到如果能把桌腿拆下来，就可以节省大约80%的运输空间，从而降低价格。这款名为 **Levette**（莱维特: 宜家首款平板包装产品）的产品被认为是第一款平板包装产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um Ingar himself um and Gilis Lung, one of the first designers, if not the first actually designing IKEA. Um they basically had a cocreation on a table um a side table to a sofa where they realized that if they could find a way to take off the legs uh you would save uh approximately 80% of the air and thereby drive down the prices. So this product H called Levette is uh claimed to be one of the first if not the first uh flatback product and still today it is incredibly interesting because if you look at what that does from a cost perspective and a climate footpoint uh uh point of view it's just an incredible invention.</p>
</details>

Jesper 强调，从成本和碳足迹的角度来看，这仍然是一项了不起的发明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and still today it is incredibly interesting because if you look at what that does from a cost perspective and a climate footpoint uh uh point of view it's just an incredible invention.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问宜家是否曾抄袭过设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Has a ever stolen a design?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，他无法回答早期世代的问题，但在他任职宜家期间，以及作为宜家瑞典设计公司（**IKEA Sweden**: 宜家内部的设计部门）的负责人，他们引以为豪的是开发自己的设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I wouldn't uh be able to answer that if I look back uh earlier generations but if you look at my own period at IKEA and uh also being the leader of EKO Sweden who is the design company I think we pride ourselves to develop our own designs.</p>
</details>

他表示，宜家当然会受到时代潮流的启发，但非常小心，绝不抄袭他人或侵犯他人权利。他回忆不起近几十年来有任何关于这方面的争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course we we will be inspired of the you know of the the different um trends of the time but we are very careful to not copy anybody else or infringe on anybody's rights and I can't remember even um uh you know if you look at the last decades any any argument around that comprod um founded IA in 1943 when he was 17 years old and you worked with him for a very long time right.</p>
</details>

### 英格瓦·坎普拉德的遗产与宜家价值观的传承

Nicola 提到 Ingvar Kamprad 在17岁时（1943年）创立了宜家，并询问 Jesper 是不是与他共事了很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">comprod um founded IA in 1943 when he was 17 years old and you worked with him for a very long time right.</p>
</details>

Jesper 证实他从1999年末开始担任 Ingvar 的助理，为期三年，之后两人成为好友，他很荣幸能与 Ingvar 共事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I had the opportunity to work as assistant to him starting in late 99 for 3 years actually and then of course uh ever since we became good friends and I had the pleasure to work with him.</p>
</details>

Nicola 询问 Jesper 会如何描述 Ingvar，因为他在瑞典是个传奇人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you describe him as a person because he was a bit of a what should we say a fairy tale type of figure in Sweden? Right.</p>
</details>

Jesper 称 Ingvar 是一个非常特别的人。当他刚开始担任助理时，对 Ingvar 并不十分了解，但他发现 Ingvar 是一个非常真诚的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, he was a very special person. When I when I started as um his assistant, I I didn't really know him that well and what I found um many things I found interesting and one of the things what is very authentic uh person.</p>
</details>

Jesper 讲述了 Ingvar 的人生故事：他在30多岁时取得了成功，公司不断发展，赚了很多钱，但他意识到个人成功或金钱对他来说兴趣不大。于是，他回归了童年时的节俭生活和原则，非常注重成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as he told me his life story, you know, he made a success in his late 30s. The company was growing. He made a lot of money and only to realize that for him the personal success or the value of money had actually quite little interest for him. So he returned to his childhood um uh style and his childhood principles which was a person who lived quite the thrifty life. He was very costconcious.</p>
</details>

Jesper 曾试图说服他更换旧的沃尔沃汽车，但他一直开到生命尽头。这辆车现在捐赠给了哥德堡的**沃尔沃博物馆**（Volvo Museum: 位于瑞典哥德堡的汽车博物馆），至今仍能运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I tried to convince him to change his old Volvo but he kept it for the rest of his life. Today it's donated actually to the Volvo Museum in Gatenburg. Uh and as far as I know it still runs.</p>
</details>

Ingvar 是一个真正的企业家，一个有远见的人。Jesper 认为他不太擅长战略，而是直接付诸行动，喜欢待在门店和工厂，讨厌会议室和委员会。对他来说，生活就是关于工厂、与人一起开发产品，以及在门店为顾客提供更好的服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um he was um uh he was a true entrepreneur. He was um a person with great vision. Uh he was not so good at strategy. I would say he skipped that part and he went straight for actions on the store floor on the factory floor and so on. And he just that was the two places he loved to be. He basically detested the boardrooms or the committees and um for him life was about the factory developing products uh with people or the store making sure that we make a better job for our customers.</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为许多零售业创始人都有类似的特质，他们痴迷于门店和顾客。Ingvar 属于那个懂得如何通过规模化创造价值的时代，宜家在这方面是大师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's interesting I suspect that a lot of retail founders are a bit the same way right obsessed about the there are several people who have similar uh philosophies as as he he had. Um he was also of that generation who basically understood how to scale business and create value through scale and IA was a master in that.</p>
</details>

Nicola 询问 Jesper 如何确保 Ingvar 的价值观在公司中得以传承。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How have you how do you make sure that his uh values are still present in the firm?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为 Ingvar 在价值观方面做得很好。宜家的价值观并非事后提出的宣传口号，而是融入到从招聘到工作方式的方方面面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think he did a good job with the values. The values in IKEA is not something that comes as a communication slogan afterwards but it's actually integrate in in into from the recruitment to how we like to work.</p>
</details>

他提到，当 Ingvar 去世时，大家都在思考如何继续维护和发展公司文化。在过去几年，尽管经历了疫情、战争、经济动荡、贸易战和气候危机等商业领域最困难的时期，宜家仍能保持良好发展速度，这很大程度上归功于其价值观。员工知道自己有权做决策，并被授权，同时公司以谦逊的姿态共同领导。Jesper 相信，如果 Ingvar 看到宜家今天的领导方式，他会感到骄傲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and it is in it is interesting because the question came when he passed away how we would continue to maintain and develop the culture and I've seen through the last years you know that has been probably the most difficult period for any one of us in business like for yourself. Um we have had pandemic war economic turmoil trade war uh climate crisis. So these have not been easy times. Um what I've seen in IKEA is that we have been able to do quite well maintain speed in the company uh a lot thanks to the values where people know that they are actually mandated to take decisions and empower themselves um and that we try to lead in a humb style together. I believe Ringa would have been proud if I've seen how actually we are leading the company today.</p>
</details>

### 可持续发展：道德责任与财务优势

Nicola 提到宜家非常重视可持续发展，尽管其他一些公司有所退缩，但宜家却坚定不移。她问为什么宜家对此如此确信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things you focus in a lot on is sustainability and um whilst some other companies have kind of backtracked a bit here, you are really holding the ground. Um why why are you so convinced about this?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为，世界正在出现一个有趣的分化，越来越多的公司正在走向“气候智能”的道路，尽管许多公司可能不会大声宣扬，或者认为自己仍处于早期阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think to start with I think it's an interesting divide in the world and and I see more and more companies actually being on the uh train ride to to become climate smart. Um uh many of them might not shout it out loudly. Many many think that they are still in the early days of it.</p>
</details>

他注意到，在银行界和服务业，尤其是在美国以及世界其他一些地区，一些公司有所退缩，这让他觉得很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I've uh interesting enough I've seen uh also in the banking world and in services uh in particular in US but also in uh parts of other parts of the world where people have backtracked them which I found interesting.</p>
</details>

就宜家而言，早在《**巴黎协定**》（Paris Agreement: 2015年通过的全球气候变化协定）签署之前，他们就决定成为气候智能领域的领导者。宜家一直是理解和衡量其影响的先驱，尤其是在**范围三排放**（Scope 3: 供应链和产品使用产生的间接排放）方面，这意味着对公司端到端的影响进行衡量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now in our case um we took the decision to um to be a leader when it comes to uh climate smartness um actually even before the Paris agreement was signed and we have been a pioneer in figuring out both how do you understand your impact how do you measure that in terms of what is called scope 3 which means basically end to end for the company and interesting enough at this moment many years into the climate work what we have found except that It's good from an ethical perspective because we like to contribute from a moral standpoint. Um it is uh something that has strengthen IKEA's brand massively.</p>
</details>

Jesper 指出，除了从道德角度出发，气候工作还极大地增强了宜家的品牌。数据显示，全球各地的人们都非常重视这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have data points that shows across all of the world how important this is for people.</p>
</details>

最有趣的是，许多人认为气候转型会带来额外的高成本或负担，但宜家发现，从原材料生产、运输、零售到顾客的整个过程中，气候智能实际上帮助他们降低了成本，使公司在财务上更加明智，为未来做好了准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here comes the most interesting part of them all. Maybe Nikolai a lot of people think that the climate transformation would come at a extra high cost or at some so to say um uh as a as a burden. What we have found out is from raw material production, transport, retailing all the way to customers that it's actually uh helped us reduce our cost and become a much uh smarter financially uh set company for the future.</p>
</details>

Nicola 补充说，人们高度重视环境，但并不愿意为此支付额外费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because what is interesting is if you ask people, they rate environment very highly, but they are not really very keen to pay extra for it, are they?</p>
</details>

Jesper 同意这一点，并分享了一个故事。几年前，他在贝尔格莱德拜访了一位单身母亲，她有两个孩子，打两份工，对环境充满热情，非常担心气候变化及其对孩子未来的影响。当 Jesper 问她是否愿意为宜家的气候智能产品支付额外费用时，她回答“不”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That that's right. I think one of the common misunderstandings with that which I would subscribe to a while ago myself uh there was a lady I met in um making a home visit in Bgrade a couple of years ago. She was a single mother, two kids, uh two jobs. Uh we had a discussion because she was passionate about uh about environment. She she was very fearful for climate change. Uh she saw that all around and for her kids future. And when I asked her if she was prepared to pay extra for an IKEA product that would be climate smart, she said no.</p>
</details>

她解释说自己没有钱，有两份工作，两个孩子，母亲放学后会来帮忙。她明确表示，她期望像 Jesper 和 Nicola 这样的领导者承担起责任。Jesper 认为她在道德上是正确的，而他当时不知道的是，她在财务上也是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then she explained to me, I don't have the money. So I have two jobs. I have two kids. My mother comes and help me when they're back from school, etc. Do you really expect me to pay? Um, and she was very clear say, I expect you, yes, and leaders like you and me, Nikolai, to take our responsibility. And I think she was morally right. What I didn't know then that she was actually financially right.</p>
</details>

Jesper 强调，可持续发展不需要额外付费。相反，宜家为实现气候智能所做的一切都帮助他们节省了资金。他解释说，如果使用更少或更智能的材料，或者使用循环材料，成本自然会降低。如果采用可再生能源而非昂贵的石油和天然气，不仅能获得独立性，还能降低能源账单。宜家的能源账单比《巴黎协定》之前降低了29%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is no need to pay extra for sustainability. On the contrary, everything we have done in IKEA um to become climate smart has actually made us save money. And when you think about it, it's obvious because of course if you use less material or material in a smarter way or have the opportunity of circular material, would that make you more expensive or would it make you lower? Of course, it's lower price. If you implement renewable energy instead of expensive uh um oil and gas, you don't only get independence, you actually of course get a lower energy bill. Our energy bill in IKEA is 29% lower than before Paris agreement.</p>
</details>

他承认，这并非总是容易，需要投资和大规模的投入才能获得财务效益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you continue step by step in the value chain. And even if it's not always that easy, it requires investments and it requires that you take a big step putting your whole scale behind it otherwise you don't get the financial benefits.</p>
</details>

Nicola 提到宜家甚至更进一步，为产品创建了二手市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you've taken all this uh one more step forward to even uh have uh creating a secondhand market for your for your products.</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，二手市场仍处于测试阶段，但受到顾客的高度赞赏。尽管它对宜家总碳足迹的减少贡献不大，但他们正在努力。宜家提供门店回收服务，并在全球所有门店销售二手家具。最近，他们开始在挪威和西班牙开展业务，并计划在全球推广。宜家甚至创建了自己的二手数字平台，让顾客更容易地在彼此之间销售宜家产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The secondhand part uh I would say it's still a bit of um uh test and trial from our side. It's u very much appreciated by customers. If I look at the total carbon footprint of IKEA, it's not the thing that has contributed the biggest uh carbon reduction. Uh but we're on our way. So what we do is we offer takeback service to our stores. Um we do sell secondhand furniture through our all our stores globally and recently we have started to engage in Norway in Spain and we are intending to roll it out globally. We have actually created our own secondhand digital platform where then customers can actually get uh an easier way to sell their IKEA uh products um from customer to customer.</p>
</details>

### 零售转型：从郊区大店到城市中心全渠道

Nicola 提到宜家以郊区大店闻名，但现在在伦敦牛津街开设了旗舰店，并询问原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very interesting. Um, now you are known for these huge uh stores outside cities, but you now have opened a flagship store on London's Oxford Street. Um, tell me about it. Why why is this?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为这是宜家最大的投资之一，并希望它能成功。他解释说，几年前，当宜家开始深入访谈全球顾客时（当时宜家还未转型为全渠道和在线业务，大约八年前几乎完全依赖实体店），顾客告诉他们，如果宜家不能在普通工作日晚上，当他们需要某些东西时，通过手机或笔记本电脑在线出现，他们就会开始放弃宜家。这是一个非常重要的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's one of the biggest investments we've done to be honest. So hopefully uh it will work. It's it's an interesting thing because um a few years ago when we um when we started to deep interview customers around the world um this is actually before IKEA transformed into omni channel and online at all back then some 8 years ago we were more or less only uh store-based. So when we spoke to customers, they told us uh that if you don't show up uh on an ordinary workday when I put my kids to bed and and uh I need something. If you don't show up online in my phone or on my laptop, I'm I'm going to start to deselect you. So that was a very important message for us to hear from my customers.</p>
</details>

同样的顾客，尤其是居住在大城市或都市区的顾客，表示他们会偶尔去东京、伦敦或纽约的宜家，但如果附近没有宜家，或者离家10分钟车程内没有宜家，他们可能会选择其他品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The same customers often said in particular the ones living in the uh biggest cities or the metropolitan areas of the world say we will go to IKEA in Tokyo in London in York uh from time to time but again if we if we don't have an IKEA around the corner or 10 minutes away we might choose somebody else so we we began a journey uh of transforming into online services the whole logistical backbone of IKEA was re-engineered.</p>
</details>

因此，宜家开始了向在线服务转型的旅程，并重新设计了整个物流骨干。作为其中的一部分，他们开始尝试在城市中开设小型宜家门店。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a part of that you can say the cream on top was that we started to experiment with uh smaller versions of IKEA in cities.</p>
</details>

Jesper 承认，他们犯了很多错误，对城市顾客的需求也存在许多误判。但七年后，他们终于找到了一种模式，它更像是一个大型门店，只是规模小一些，但顾客仍然可以购买宜家的所有产品，也可以享用肉丸。虽然无法在牛津街直接取走沙发，但可以购买所有商品，并且很多产品可以当天带走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interesting enough I think we made so many mistakes and so many miscalculations on what we thought customers in the city uh would like to have. Um but seven years down the road we've actually found a format which is much like a big store. It's just a bit smaller but you can actually buy everything from IKEA. You can have your meatballs and obviously you won't be able to pick up your sofa from Oxford Street, but you will be able to shop everything and a lot of products you you can take with you on the same day actually.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问效果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is it working out?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，门店开业几周以来，这是宜家迄今为止最成功的开业之一。第一周，它就成为宜家访问量第二大的门店。与大型门店相比，这无疑是一个成功。但他们还需要一年的时间来评估其财务表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a couple of weeks in. It's u we are running in the second week. It's one of the biggest successes uh from an opening point of view we had uh so far. So already the first week it was the second uh biggest store when it comes to visitations uh in IKEA. And if you compare that then to the big stores out there, that has has to be seen as a success. But we need to give it a year um to see also that we manage um as well when it come not only to attract people but also financially.</p>
</details>

Nicola 表示下次去伦敦一定会去看看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, for sure I will check it out when I'm in London next.</p>
</details>

Jesper 说那是一个很酷的地方，有一些额外的“惊喜”会让 Nicola 喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a cool place. It has a couple of extra spices to Nikki experience that I think you will enjoy.</p>
</details>

### 地缘政治挑战与供应链适应

Nicola 询问地缘政治局势如何影响宜家的采购和供应链。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now how uh is the geopolitical situation impacting how you source and how you think about your supply chain?</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，几十年来，他们这一代人习惯了每年都更容易达成多边协议，边境问题也越来越少。他们曾认为贸易合作的道路会持续下去。然而，大约十年前，他们发现自己处于一个更具挑战性的境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you can say for for decades we were used I think in our generation um um yearbyyear um easier uh to do multilateral uh deals um less issues with borders. So we were sort so to say I think taken for granted that the pathway of uh collaboration around trade would continue and then we find ourselves in some 10 years back in a much more challenging situation.</p>
</details>

他认为世界正在变化，这是可以理解的。他引用了一月份在达沃斯遇到的一位人士的话：“我们已经离开了旧的世界秩序，但尚未建立新的世界秩序，而过渡时期往往会有些混乱。”这正是他们今天所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's understandable the world is changing um as I met somebody in Davos in January who said that we we have left one world order and we haven't yet established a new one and times in between tend to be a little bit chaotic and that's what we're seeing today.</p>
</details>

地缘政治无疑给公司带来了压力，像宜家这样的大公司发现自己陷入了一个有趣的困境：以前公司行动迅速而政府行动缓慢，但现在政府的行动速度（并非出于好原因）让公司难以跟上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously you can say it puts pressure on companies in general and big companies like IKEA find ourselves in the interesting dilemma that way back companies used to be quick and government slow and if you look at the speed of governments right now and not for a good reason. It's difficult for us as companies to to keep up.</p>
</details>

因此，宜家继续投资，继续在市场中进行长期思考，并沿途缓解贸易限制等问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so what we do we continue to invest um we continue to think long term in our markets. Um and basically we have to mitigate some of the uh issues around the trade restrictions and so on along the way.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问为什么瑞典公司在国际化方面比挪威公司更成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you think Swedish companies are so much more successful than Norwegian companies in terms of rolling rolling out internationally?</p>
</details>

Jesper 质疑这种说法，认为两国都有不同的成功。挪威在能源领域取得了巨大成功，也有像**Yara**（雅苒: 挪威化肥和农业解决方案公司）这样在化肥领域表现出色的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, is that so? I think uh well I think we have had um a different uh successes, right? I think Norway has been incredibly successful in energy. uh when it comes to uh uh companies like Yara working with fertilization and so on. So there are different things in Norway with that is of course phenomenal.</p>
</details>

瑞典则在科技领域表现出色，宜家是其中之一，还有像**H&M**（海恩斯莫里斯: 瑞典时尚零售公司）这样的公司。他认为斯堪的纳维亚公司普遍成功的原因之一是他们知道自己规模小，因此必须走出去，适应不同的文化，寻找机会，实现双赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh Sweden has been good in technology and in um with IKEA as one of the leader but many more like H&M. I I think maybe one of the reasons that Scandinavians in general are successful is that we know that we're small. So in order to be successful we have to be out there. We have to adapt. We have to understand different cultures and look for opportunities and win-win.</p>
</details>

Jesper 相信，在当今世界，斯堪的纳维亚公司和领导者在寻求双赢解决方案方面处于领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I do believe um as of today in this world, I think Scandinavian companies and leaders in general are um in the forefront of looking for win-win solutions.</p>
</details>

### 科技赋能：AI如何重塑宜家

Nicola 提到科技，并询问 Jesper 认为科技将如何塑造未来的宜家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned technology. Tell us how you think technology will shape IKEA going forward.</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，宜家在数字革命中起步较晚。像亚马逊这样的平台公司早在21世纪初就彻底改变了零售业，而宜家凭借其门店模式和业务取得了巨大成功。直到2012-2015年左右，他们才开始看到顾客行为的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To start with, you can say uh IKA was late in the digital um revolution if you like. So basically uh platform companies like Amazon and more revolutionized retailing um you know for good I would say and that revolution started in the early 2000s. IKEA continued to be very successful with our store formats and and um with our business. So it was first somewhere around 2012 14 15 we started to see change behaviors with our customers.</p>
</details>

因此，宜家决定进行在线和**全渠道**（omnichannel: 整合线上线下所有销售渠道，为顾客提供无缝购物体验）转型。有趣的是，当他们做出这个决定时，并不知道几年后会爆发疫情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we were late on that and as I referred to before we decided to make the the online and the omni channel transformation. Interesting enough Nikolai um as we took that decision we had no clue about the pandemic that came a few years later.</p>
</details>

Jesper 强调，正是由于转向在线业务，宜家才在疫情期间得以幸存。如果没有在线运营的机会，公司将面临巨额亏损、裁员和业务大幅萎缩。这让他们学到了一个重要的教训：要对世界的变化保持警觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now thanks to us shifting to online it actually saved the company during the pandemic. We would have been in massive red numbers in layoffs and in in a great retraction of volumes and everything if it wouldn't have been for the opportunity to actually operate through through online. So it gave us um a good lesson I think to to uh keep your eyes and ears open for the changes in the world.</p>
</details>

他指出，人工智能（**AI**: Artificial Intelligence，人工智能）正在强势崛起，并将再次彻底改变宜家。AI 已经在宜家的价值链中发挥作用，帮助简化商品流通、节省成本，在大规模客户服务和家居规划方面提供帮助，未来可能还会以更多他们今天尚未知晓的方式提供帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we see uh AI is uh coming big and for us that's going to re revolutionize and it's already in our value chain revolutionizing uh goods flow helping simplify and saving cost through goods flow. It's helping our us in customer service uh at scale. It's helping us when it comes to home planning how you actually uh serve your customers in making um sense of home planning in the future and probably it's going to help us in many more ways that we don't know today.</p>
</details>

Nicola 提到宜家的大型蓝色目录在北欧地区曾比《圣经》更普及，并询问是否还在印刷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">your big blue catalog was more ubiquitous than the Bible uh in the Nordic region. Do you still print it?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，宜家几年前就不再印刷目录了。虽然少数市场仍将其作为额外的营销手段，但随着在线业务的兴起，目录作为家居布置基础的作用逐渐减弱。最后几年，他们发现印刷目录是对资源的浪费，最终也浪费了纸张。他们找到了更好的方式与顾客互动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we we don't print the catalog actually since a couple of years back. There are a few markets I know that keep it as an extra you can say marketing injection but as we knew the catalog as like um the foundation for home furnishing, it started to lose its um uh role when online came. So we at the last years it was also just observing to say that it was a waste of resources. It was a waste of paper in the end and we find other ways better ways to engage with our customers.</p>
</details>

### 领导力哲学：谦逊、务实、鼓励冒险与平衡

Nicola 询问 Jesper 如何定义自己的领导风格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. But how would you define your leadership style?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为自己是宜家价值观的良好代表，至少是其中一些价值观的代表。他认为人们会把他描述为一个意志坚定但又谦逊的人。他像宜家所有员工一样，只是一名员工，对他来说，保持务实很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think from a leadership perspective I think um I think I'm a fairly good representative of the IKEA values or at least some of them. So I think people would describe me as u a person with a lot of willpower but also humbleness. I I'm an employee like everybody else in in IKEA and um I think um for me it's important to stay grounded in reality.</p>
</details>

他曾与 Ingvar 共事，不仅向他学习，还意识到他们对与工厂、家庭和门店中的员工保持联系有着相同的看法。他从中获得乐趣，并相信这能帮助宜家找到未来的发展之路，因为他们贴近现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I worked with Ingbar. I had the opportunity not only to learn from him but also realize that we shared a lot of the same viewpoints of staying grounded with people out there in our factories in our homes in our stores. Um I get joy from that and um I believe thereby also sometimes I and we in IA find actually the pathway to speed in in the future because we are close to reality.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问保持务实的关键是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the uh what's the key to staying grounded?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为，幸福的婚姻和生活中的稳定性是首要条件，因为如今的领导者需要敏捷。他们经历了危机接踵而至的时期，需要培养生活的韧性、充电的方式，以及接受困境并承认自己没有所有答案的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well uh I think happy marriage is number one and stability uh uh in your life in general I think is uh is required because today to be a leader it requires you to be agile. Um again we have seen crisis after crisis you need to develop a way of resilience in your life a way of recharge uh a way of I think accepting that in many ways you need to accept dilemas and accept that you don't have the answers but that you can be open transparent authentic in your leadership will allow you to actually collaborate with people and hopefully do a better job than if you are the know it all so to say.</p>
</details>

他强调，开放、透明、真诚的领导力能促进合作，比“无所不知”的领导者做得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that you can be open transparent authentic in your leadership will allow you to actually collaborate with people and hopefully do a better job than if you are the know it all so to say.</p>
</details>

Nicola 提到 Jesper 几次提到“速度”，并询问如何确保宜家保持高速发展，以及速度为何如此重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned speed a couple of times. How do you make sure that EKI is a speedy place and why sorry and why is speed so important?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为，敏捷和速度很重要，因为世界变化越来越快，无论是在科技还是政治领域。对于像宜家这样的大公司来说，最大的风险之一就是行动过于缓慢和官僚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speed is important. I think um agility and speed is important because the world is changing in a faster and faster uh way. Uh we have seen that in technology. We see that in politics and so forth. And being a big company, I think it's one of the biggest risks for us is that we are too slow and too bureaucratic.</p>
</details>

他指出，作为大型系统的一部分，总有一种“自然力量”会使事情变得复杂，例如雇佣过多专家、召开过多会议等。因此，需要不断削减会议，鼓励人们做决策、承担风险、敢于犯错。宜家正是由那些敢于冒险的人年复一年发展起来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And obviously being part of a big system, there is always um force of nature uh that invites you to make things more complicated. maybe hire a little bit too many experts, uh too many meetings and so on. So you need to constantly try to cut down on meetings, uh encourage people to take decisions, to take risks, to dare to to do mistakes. Um IKEA was never there, right? It was developed year by year by people who had the courage to to take those risks.</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为，除了气候变化、经济动荡等外部因素，宜家今天面临的最大威胁是其内部的创业能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think the biggest threat today for us beside things like climate change, economic turmoil would be our internal capability to actually be entrepreneurs.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问如何鼓励人们承担风险，因为这本质上就是一项冒险的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you encourage people to take risks? I mean it's a it's by definition a risky business.</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，他会以身作则，自己也犯错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I try to be a good example myself and do mistakes.</p>
</details>

Nicola 追问他犯过的最大错误是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the biggest mistake you ever made?</p>
</details>

Jesper 笑着说“从何说起呢？”他认为，如果将错误定义为“对问题采取了行动但没有找到正确的解决方案”，那么过去几年，宜家在零售转型方面比以往任何时候都更具创业精神。他们进行了数字和实体投资，例如城市门店，这些在最初并不奏效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I Where should we begin? I I think if you look at the last part um if if we say the definition of mistake is that you have acted on a problem but didn't find the right solution if you say like that and I think the last years we have been more entrepreneurial than in a very long time in particular when it comes to transformation of retail so we have invested both digitally and uh physically in as we spoke about city stores and other things that simply didn't work in the beginning um but By having that spirit and not just working linearly but actually iterate a lot of different tests and trials you you will be faster in finding the pathway to the future.</p>
</details>

但正是通过这种精神，不线性工作，而是进行大量的测试和试验，他们才能更快地找到通往未来的道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but By having that spirit and not just working linearly but actually iterate a lot of different tests and trials you you will be faster in finding the pathway to the future.</p>
</details>

Jesper 分享了他鼓励员工承担风险的方法：他有一张“**香蕉卡**”（banana card: Jesper Brodin发明的象征性工具，旨在鼓励员工敢于承担风险和犯错，他会为员工的错误“共同署名”）。这张卡是在与一群宜家同事对话中产生的，他们公开表示有时害怕犯错，担心后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do I encourage people? Well, I have one of my favorite techniques is I have a banana card and the banana card was actually invented in a dialogue with uh a big group of IKEA colleagues who said openly that I we feel sometimes afraid of daring to make mistakes. What would be the consequences?</p>
</details>

于是，Jesper 发明了这张卡片，他会提前为员工的错误“共同署名”。他把这张卡片发给了很多人，并会跟进每个收到卡片的人，这更多是一种鼓励。他想表达的是，如果犯了错误，需要有人分担负担，可以依靠他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I invented this card where where I basically co-sign uh in advance for your mistake and I've handed that out to a lot of people and I actually do follow up with everyone who I handed this card to but more as an encouragement to say if you do a mistake and you look for somebody to share that burden with you can count on me.</p>
</details>

这张卡片象征性地告诉大家，不要等待，要立即行动。如果有一个想法却不付诸行动，不仅会错过学习的机会，而且那些不付诸行动的人，内心会慢慢地“死去”。对于宜家来说，重要的是成为一个充满活力的社区，人们敢于追求自己的想法，并不断寻找下一个目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and obviously symbolically to say don't wait with acting on your ideas. If you have an idea and you don't act on it, it's not only that we miss the opportunity of uh of learning but I think people who don't act on ideas slowly and gradually uh there's something dying inside you know if you give up on acting on your ideas and for us it's important to be a live community of people who who go for their ideas and continue to look for the next horizon.</p>
</details>

### 音乐与领导力：平衡工作与生活

Nicola 提到 Jesper 曾谈到“充电”，并听说他也是一位摇滚明星。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um yes but you you talked about um recharging and uh and so on. I get her that you are uh also a rock star.</p>

Jesper 笑着否认自己是摇滚明星，但表示他喜欢摇滚乐。Nicola 问他是否玩摇滚，是否在乐队里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that that in that case you have been totally misinformed. I like rock music though and you play rock. You play in a band, right?</p>
</details>

Jesper 证实他确实在乐队里，而且一直如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I do. I do. I've always done actually.</p>
</details>

Nicola 提到了乐队的名字 **Lord Beaverbrock**（比弗布鲁克勋爵: Jesper Brodin的乐队名），Jesper 证实这是他最近的乐队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lord Beaverbrock. Yeah, that is the recent uh band. That's correct.</p>
</details>

他们决定播放一首乐队的歌曲，Jesper 建议播放《Said Generation》，这是一首献给那些为我们和下一代利益而努力的年轻活动家的歌曲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we are going to play a song here, but not uh not on air, but we'll we'll cut it in afterwards. Which one should we put in?

Nicola 问音乐对他个人意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the world for you and what does music do to you as a person as a human being?</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，他从12、13岁起就对音乐感兴趣。老实说，最初的兴趣是发现如果学会弹吉他唱歌，在追求女朋友和参加派对方面会更幸运。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I've always been interested um of music uh since I was um I think 12 13 years. Uh to be honest, the the first interest in music was I noticed that if I learned to play the guitar and sing um I was more lucky when it comes to the competition of girlfriends and parties and other things. So, I I had a a thought about it.</p>
</details>

后来，他的音乐兴趣发展到新的领域。

<details>

<p class="english-text">that my musical interest developed into new uh areas along the way.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问他是否认为这就是人们开始组建流行乐队的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think that do you think that's why do you think that's why people start in pop groups generally yet?</p>
</details>

Jesper 猜测，20岁以下的人中，80%对音乐的兴趣可能较少，这只是他的个人看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Probably below the age of 20 I would I would guess that 80% of them have less interest in music. That's just my opinion.</p>
</details>

但他认真地说，音乐对他来说是一种放松方式。在一天或一周的紧张工作之后，如果能花一小时弹电吉他，那会让他非常放松，完全与外界隔绝。这对他来说有点像冥想，因为在弹吉他时无法思考其他事情。这是一种清理思绪的方式，而且与他人一起演奏也很有趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So um but in any case I I for me to be serious I think music is a way of relaxing. So, uh, after a, you know, a tough day at work or a tough week, if I get one hour with my electric guitar and, um, to play a little bit, that's, uh, super relaxing. It's like totally disconnecting. It's a bit of, uh, meditation for me because you can't do that and have other thoughts in your head. So, it's a way to clean your mind a little bit and it's also incredibly fun to play with others.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问音乐是否对他的领导力有影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Do you think it does anything to your leadership?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为每个人都需要有“充电”的渠道，对他来说，音乐无疑是其中之一。创作音乐、写歌词和旋律，为他的生活增添了另一个维度，也开启了许多其他维度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I think all of us need to have our channel of um uh recharging and for me music is definitely one of them. Um and writing music, writing lyrics, writing music uh gives me so to say another dimension to life and um it opens up to many other dimensions as well.</p>
</details>

作为一项爱好，有机会与乐队见面、在录音室录音、专注于完全不同的事情，为他的工作提供了大量的“充电”。他认为这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course as a hobby um to have the opportunity to meet the band uh to record in a studio to focus on something totally different gives me a lot of um recharging of batteries for for what I do at work. I think it's very important.</p>
</details>

他认为，如果工作之外有真正热爱的事情，会更容易应对压力，更容易思考其他事情，让自己成为一个更有趣的人。作为大型组织和公司的首席执行官，人们可能会陷入“自我重要性”的兔子洞，或者被问题困住，甚至陷入“工作时间越长、睡眠越少就越成功”的误区。但事实恰恰相反，需要找到拓宽视野和充电的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think if you have something outside work which you really are passionate about, it makes it easier to cope with stress, easier to um you know think about other things, makes you a more interesting person, more fun also that in the roles that we have also leading as CEOs of big organization and companies, you can get trapped in your own rabbit hole of your own importance, but also you can get stuck in your problems and and also even in the worst case um the myth that if you gear up a little bit extra and work longer hours would be the sleep less etc. that that would be the pathway to success and obviously it's the opposite. You need to find ways to to broaden your perspective and recharge.</p>

### 最引以为傲的成就与宜家的未来愿景

Nicola 问 Jesper 在宜家的职业生涯中最引以为傲的是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Looking at your journey at IKEA, what are you the most proud of?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说有几件事。有时是细节，例如他参与开发的一些优秀产品。但如果谈到某个领域，他最引以为傲的是1995年在巴基斯坦卡拉奇的宜家工作，那是他的第一个任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, like a couple of things. Um sometimes it's um it can be details, great products I've been part of um developing and so on. But if I take any area I think it is uh starting in 95 in IKEA in Pakistan Karachi Pakistan was my first assignment.</p>
</details>

当时，宜家正在寻找欧洲以外的采购机会，他被派去建立纺织品采购业务。从业务增长的角度来看，这是一次巨大的成功。但这也是宜家首次面对一个问题：是否需要将价值观带入供应链，还是只在自己的办公室或社区中应用就足够了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um these were the days when IKEA was looking at sourcing uh opportunities outside Europe. So uh I was uh put there to build up uh sourcing of textiles. I did it was an incredible success in many ways from my business growth. But it was also the first time at IKEA when we started to confront ourselves to say do we need to bring our values to our supply chain as well or is it enough if we apply them on our on our own offices or communities.</p>
</details>

最终，他们得出的结论是，宜家必须在环境和社会方面成为领导者，这适用于其价值链中的一切。他作为一名年轻领导者参与了在亚洲开发这一理念，除了知道它今天运作良好，以及它对环境和社会以及许多人意味着什么之外，他还发现，它帮助宜家增强了财务实力。因此，“做好事”实际上也有助于“做好生意”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and in the end of the day we so to say came to the conclusion that we have to be a leader when it comes to environmental aspects and social aspects and that goes for everything we do in our value chain. I was part of developing that in Asia uh as a young leader and except for knowing how well it works today and what that has meant uh environmentally but also socially for a lot of people uh I found incredible joy to know that it's helped IA to strengthen its finances. So to be a good business is actually also uh helpful when doing good business.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问他最喜欢的宜家家具或产品是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your favorite EK furniture or uh product that you sell?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说，他曾负责厨房部门六年。他认为厨房是宜家最复杂的产品，因为它是一个系统的一部分，需要了解许多产品才能组成一个厨房。他觉得这绝对令人着迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the kitchen department for six years. So, uh kitchens is I would say it's the most complex product in a care because it's part of a system. So, you need to know many products in order to make a a kitchen. And I found that absolutely fascinating.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问他心中一个好厨房的关键是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in your mind, what's the key to a good kitchen?</p>
</details>

Jesper 认为，从家居布置的角度来看，一个好厨房的关键在于质量。通过将质量融入设计的每个部分，并仍能实现规模化，这证明了宜家**民主设计**的理念：可以以最好的质量提供价格实惠的厨房。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, a good kitchen from a home furnishing perspective is actually quality. So by integrating quality in every part of your design uh and still being able to scale that proves that you actually it's proving the IKEA democratic design formula that you can make an affordable kitchen at the best quality.</p>
</details>

但他认为，对人们来说，厨房是家的核心。它提供解决方案，让人们放松、做作业、在家工作、享受与朋友和家人的庆祝活动。所以，在他看来，厨房真的是家的心脏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but then I think kitchen for people is about the heart of the home. It's about providing solutions where people you know relax do their homework, work from home uh enjoy friends, family celebrations. So the kitchen I as I see it is really the heart of the home for people.</p>
</details>

Nicola 问他是否做饭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you cook?</p>
</details>

Jesper 回答说他做饭。他以为 Nicola 会问他是否擅长做饭，但他不擅长。在他们家里，他是“首席洗碗工”。不过，他的意大利肉酱面做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do. What? I thought you would ask are you a good uh cook but I'm not. Well I in in our family I am the chef chief uh dishwasher. So but I I have a couple of my pasta bologna uh is uh is good.</p>
</details>

Nicola 询问 Jesper 对宜家未来十年的愿景和梦想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your vision and and your dreams for IKEA for the next 10 years?</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，宜家未来十年的梦想是继续增长，接触更多人，提供更多就业机会，并服务更多全球顾客。其中最大的梦想是证明“做好事”也能“做好生意”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for IKEA for the next 10 years I think um the dream is to continue to to be able to grow and meet um and reach more people both offering jobs and uh meeting more customers around the world and I think the biggest dream in all of that is to be a proof point that it is actually possible to be a good business by doing good business.</p>
</details>

他指出，将“以人为本”的原则（包括多样性、包容性、尊重人）融入公司，并将宜家打造成一个真正的气候智能价值链，并通过此实现卓越的财务表现，这就是他的宏大愿景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the integration of um uh people, respectful people principles when it comes to diversity, inclusion, uh respect for people, but also uh setting up IKEA as a truly climate smart value chain and driving financial excellence through that is the big vision.</p>
</details>

### 给年轻人的建议：希望、原则与热爱

Nicola 提出了最后一个问题：他对正在收听节目的成千上万年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last question. What is your advice for young people because we got tens and tens of thousands of them listening into this?</p>
</details>

Jesper 表示，他很高兴能与许多年轻人和年轻领导者交流。他实际上成立了一个年轻活动家小组，为他和他的管理团队提供建议。他们可以完全接触公司，并且有一个很好的协议：他们每年都会在宜家年报中撰写一页内容，而 Jesper 在他们撰写之前不会进行校对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think I think for young people today um and I do have the pleasure to meet a lot of uh young people and young leaders. Um I set up actually um a group of young activists that is advising me and my management group um and they do have full access to the company by the way and we have a very nice agreement that they actually read write a page in in our annual report every year that I don't proofread before they uh write it.</p>
</details>

他认为，今天的这一代人拥有比以往任何一代都多的信息，但也更容易受到错误信息的诱惑。因此，重要的是要抱有希望，并明确表达自己的原则、代表什么以及坚持什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think um the generation today has more information and is also lured by misinformation more than probably any generation before. So I think the important thing is to have hope and to uh be outspoken of your principles what you represent and what you stand for.</p>
</details>

同时，在思考未来时，要不断寻找自己擅长和热爱的事情。如果能找到这两者的结合，很可能会找到幸福。如果不能，总会有新的机会去尝试新的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the same time I think when you think about the future look for something continue to look for the things that you're good at and the things that you love to do. And if you can find the combination of those two things, uh you probably will find happiness. And if you don't, there is always another opportunity to try something new around the corner.</p>
</details>

Nicola 总结说，Jesper 确实为数百万家庭创造了许多幸福，让他们的家变得更美好，并为此向他表示感谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you uh for sure have created a lot of happiness in the millions of homes which you have furnished. And uh so big thanks for doing all that for the world and for making uh all our homes a better place. Great talking to you for this opportunity. Thank you so much.</p>
