title: 顶级法务会计师的警告：当前 AI 狂热与未来的市场崩盘
---
### AI 狂热与历史重演的警示

我讨厌把什么都叫做泡沫，但我认为我们正处在一个极度亢奋的时期。当你和投资者交流时，他们会说数字不重要了，财务报表也不重要了，因为“这次不一样”，世界正在被改变。我会说，嗯，我以前见过这种情况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I hate calling things bubbles, but I think we're in a period of extreme euphoria where you read and speak to investors and they say that the numbers don't matter and the financial statements no longer matter because this is changing the world. I say, well, I've seen this before.</p>
</details>

你知道，我曾见证过 Nortel、Lucent、Cisco 和 360networks 是如何“改变世界”的。它们确实构建了我们今天仍在使用的互联网基础设施，但这些公司如今已不复存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I saw that Nortell was changing the world and Lucent and Cisco and 360 networks. They were building out the infrastructure of the internet that we're using today. But those companies don't exist anymore.</p>
</details>

安东尼·斯基利波蒂 (Anthony Scilipoti) 是一位**法务会计师**（Forensic Accountant: 指运用会计、审计和调查技能来审查个人或企业财务状况的专业人士），他洞察了别人忽略的细节，早在 Valiant 制药和 Nortel 崩盘前就预见到了这一切。他花了数十年时间阅读公司最不希望你看到的部分——财务报表附注。现在，他在当今的 AI 热潮中，再次发现了熟悉的警示信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthony Scilipoti is a forensic accountant who saw what others missed, predicting the collapse of both Valiant Pharmaceuticals and Nortell long before it happened. He spent decades reading what companies don't want you to see, the footnotes. Now he's spotting familiar warning signs in today's AI boom.</p>
</details>

### 从审计到法务会计的职业之路

我曾是一名在安达信 (Arthur Andersen) 工作的会计师，从事常规的审计筹备工作。我发现这份工作无法让我满足，因为我常常会发现一些有趣的会计问题或疑虑，但客户那边却毫无下文。后来，出现了一些**尽职调查**（Due Diligence: 对潜在投资或产品进行的调查或审计，以确认所有事实）的工作机会，我们可以真正审查交易。公司会请我们评估，比如他们想分拆某项业务或进行某项收购。于是我举手自荐，说：“我能做那种工作吗？” 从那以后，我开始做这类工作，并且非常热爱，从中获得了巨大的成就感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was an accountant and I was working at Arthur Anderson doing the normal audit sort of preparatory work and I found it unfulfilling because the work I would do I would find interesting or concerns with the accounting or otherwise and the clients it didn't end up ending anywhere. So, what ended up happening was there was some due diligence work to do where we could actually look at transactions, companies calling us to say, you know, we want to spin out this business or we want to make this acquisition. And then I asked, put my hand up, said, listen, can I do that sort of work? And then I started doing it and I loved it. I saw some huge fulfillment.</p>
</details>

这都与你遇到的人有关。我遇到了一位名叫阿尔·罗森 (Al Rosen) 的先生，他是约克大学的会计学系主任，也是一位有自己执业事务所的法务会计师。他曾教我们如何通过当时的 CPA 考试。我对他说：“我想和您一起工作。” 他说：“等你拿到注册会计师资格再说吧。” 我照做了。之后，我在他手下当了大约四年的学徒，这真正成就了我的事业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then it's all about people you meet. I met a gentleman named Al Rosen and he was head of accounting at York University and he was a forensic accountant. He had his own practice. He taught us to pass the exam or the CPA exam at the time and I said you know I'd like to work with you and he said well you get your CA work done and then we'll think about it. And that's what I did. And so then I toutelaged under him for some four years. And that really made it happen.</p>
</details>

### 安然事件的教训：表外风险的致命一击

我没有参与安然 (Enron) 的案子。我于 1997 年离开安达信，那时我甚至都拼不出“Enron”这个词。所发生的一切是一件非常可悲的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was not on the Enron file. I left Arthur Anderson in 1997. Couldn't even spell Enron at the time. And it's a very sad thing what happened.</p>
</details>

他们实质上存在大量的**资产负债表外**（Off-balance sheet: 指未在公司资产负债表上记录的资产或负债等项目）风险敞口。他们会签订一些**衍生品**（Derivatives: 一种金融合约，其价值源于标的资产）类型的合同，这些合同与能源价格甚至公司自身的股价挂钩。比如，“只有当股价跌至 X 时，这笔债务才会到期”，或者“只有当电价上涨到某个水平，这笔债务才无需偿还；如果跌至某个水平，他们就必须向交易对手方付款”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They essentially had a number of offbalance sheet exposures. So they would enter into derivative type contracts where that were tied to an energy price for example or even the company's own stock price and it'd be like this debt only comes due if the stock price falls to X. This debt only comes due or this derivative transaction we'd entered into and Ron was an energy trader. so if the price of electricity in kilowatt hours rises to a certain amount well then there this debt is no longer due. If it falls to this level then they're they have to pay some counterparty.</p>
</details>

这些风险基本上都是表外的，没有计入公司的负债。它们都是或有负债。当时会计准则规定，这些数字不包含在负债中，只在附注里提及。所以人们根本不关注，因为没人会去读附注。突然之间，情况开始变化。大宗商品价格出现波动，我们正处在互联网泡沫时期，经济中发生了很多变化。我们在 21 世纪初经历了一场衰退，对吧？这导致大宗商品价格大幅波动，从而触发了那些衍生品合约。结果不出所料，他们无法支付款项，公司就完了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so those were those those risks were essentially offbalance sheet. So those were not sitting on the company's liabilities. They were all contingent and at the time the accounting rules were such that the this these numbers were not included on the liabilities. They were just in the notes. And so all of a sudden so people weren't paying attention because nobody read that reads the notes. And so then all of a sudden things started to happen. There was a change and movement in commodity prices. Okay, this is now we're dealing with the dot. There was a lot of a lot of changes that happened in the economy. We we had a we had a a uh a recession in the early 2000s, right? And so that led to a lot of movements in commodity prices that triggered the derivatives. Surprise, surprise, they can't make the payments. It's done.</p>
</details>

如果这些风险没有出现在资产负债表上，投资者就不会注意到公司可能没有足够的资产来覆盖这些债务。这对安达信的影响很重要，也让我感触很深。安达信的审计师们在文件上签了字，认可了所有这些操作。当 proverbial hit the fan（ proverbial hit the fan: 俚语，意为“事情变得一团糟”）时，监管机构要求查看审计师的工作底稿，也就是支持他们审计工作的文件。他们可能知道自己做得不够，于是就销毁了文件。他们的行为突然让他们变得有罪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well, if it wasn't on the balance sheet, then investors and wouldn't wouldn't have noticed that that there was not enough assets per perhaps to cover. and and why the implication to Arthur Anderson which I think is important and then it's near and dear to my heart is you know the auditors at Arthur Anderson they're working on the file they ended up signing off on all these things well when essentially the proverbial hit the fan all of a sudden they were asking questions and the regulator asked for the working papers of the auditor that the papers of which they would support the audit work and they knew perhaps that they didn't do enough work so they shredded the documents. So all of a sudden they became guilty because of their actions</p>
</details>

最终，经过上诉，法院裁定安达信无罪，但这已是后话，因为安达信早已垮台，不复存在。它成了当时会计界所有问题的替罪羊。当然，变革是必需的。安达信遍布全球的合伙人最终都并入了其他会计师事务所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so it was found in the courts um upon appeal that uh Arthur Anderson was not guilty but that was way after the fact because Arthur Anderson was already was brought to its knees and it was over. became a scapegoat for everything wrong with uh with with accounting at the time and uh look change needed to happen. Arthur Anderson was around the world all the partners were folded into the other firms.</p>
</details>

### 审计的局限性：利益冲突与判断困境

审计的局限在于，你被雇来提供独立意见，证明财务报表在所有重大方面都按照某套会计准则公允地呈现。挑战在于时间紧迫、成本压力大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The limitations are you're hired to be a independent to give your independent opinion and attest that the financial statements present fairly in all material respects in accordance with some set of accounting standards and/or standards that's associated with a contract for example. And the challenge is time because you have to do this quickly, pressures on costs and essentially think about it this way.</p>
</details>

这就像我告诉你：“看，这是我刚准备好的成绩单，我得了 A。” 然后我把它递给你说：“你看，这是 A。如果你也确认这是 A，我会付你 X 数量的钱。” 那么你的处境就变成了，你回来说：“嗯，这其实不是 A，更像是 B+。” 我会问：“我付你多少钱来着？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like I tell you, look, I I just prepared my report card. I got an A. I now hand it to you and say, look, it's an A. And if you say that it's an A, I'll pay you X amount of money. So, look at your situation. You come back and say, well, it's actually not an A. It's kind of a B+. Uh, how much am I paying you again?</p>
</details>

“你说这是 B+ 是什么意思？难道我回答那个问题的方式不能有这种或那种解释吗？” 这就牵涉到很多事情，包括 AI 等等。商业充满了判断。是人在经营公司，而不是公司自己运转。商业交易相关的决策最终会反映在财务报表上。但当业务部门做出决策后，他们回到办公室，找到会计部门说：“嘿，我们刚做了这个。你们能想办法把它入账吗？” 会计们突然就懵了：“天啊，我现在该怎么办？” 而且，他们还会附带一句：“顺便说一下，入账的时候，要把它呈现得尽可能光鲜亮丽，让我们的投资者和所有利益相关者都对结果感到兴奋。别搞砸了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you mean it's a B+? Do you think that question that the way I answered that question couldn't have been this way or the other way you know and this is it ties into so many things you know AI and so forth business is judgment people run companies they don't run themselves the decisions associated with a business transaction end up being reflected on those financial statements but when the group that's making the decision in the business to do something well then they come back to the office and show up in the in the accounting department and say, "Hey, we just did this. You know, can you guys figure out how to account for it?" And all of a sudden, the accountants are like, "God, what do I do now? How do I do this?" Because then they and by the way, when you do this, I want it presented as as, you know, as bright as possible so that our investors and all our stakeholders are really excited by the results like don't present it badly.</p>
</details>

### AI 在财务分析中的双刃剑

很多人不读财务报表的附注。在 AI 时代，这种情况正在改变吗？你可以下载财报，扔给 AI，然后问：“我需要知道什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You said a lot of people don't read the footnotes or the financial statements. Is that changing in a world of AI where you can sort of like download the financial statement, pop it into AI and say, "What do I need to know?"</p>
</details>

我认为这实际上加剧了问题。因为现在人们会说：“安东尼，我不用读财报了。我把它扔进 AI，让 ChatGPT 告诉我这个，查找那个。” 它会列出所有相关实例，然后我就读一下，觉得一切尽在掌握。但问题是，AI 是否遗漏了什么？AI 是否理解了这些信息点之间的内在联系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's actually exacerbating the situation. because now read the financial statements, Anthony. I just put it into AI. I asked Chat GPT to tell me, "What about this? Look for that. Look for that." And there's there's all the instances of those things. and then I just read it and it's all there. Well, did the AI miss it? Did the AI understand the linkages between each of those sightings?</p>
</details>

举个例子，我最近在看一家公司，它在进行**成本资本化**（Capitalizing costs: 将一项成本记录为资产而非费用的会计处理方式）。这是一家**REIT**（Real Estate Investment Trust: 房地产投资信托基金）。如果它将成本资本化，而不是计入损益表，那么其运营收益和最终的每股收益就会显得更好。如果把成本放在资产负债表上，那看起来就像是对未来的投资，一切都很好。这里存在一个灰色地带：这到底是运营费用还是资本项目？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I'm if I'm looking at, for example, I was looking at a company recently and I was looking at it was capitalizing costs. Okay, this is a REIT. And if it capitalizes cost versus putting them through the income statement, if it goes through the income statement, it makes their operating earnings look poor, lower, and their net EPS ultimately. But if they put it on the balance sheet, well, you know, that's an investment in the future and everything looks okay, right? And so there's a gray area. Was it an operating expense or was it a capital item?</p>
</details>

我首先查找的是“资本化利息”，然后是“资本化成本”，AI 给了我所有相关的引文。你可能认为这就足够了。但我必须接着做下去。我当时正向我的一个同事演示，我说：“现在，让我们去看看损益表，实际调出 AI 告诉我们的那些报表页面。” AI 确实让我更快地找到了位置，我不再需要翻阅 300 页的文件。但它只是指明了方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I was first thing I looked for was capitalized interest. And so it gave me all the quotes and then capitalized costs and it gave me all the quotes. So then you think that that's enough, but you have to then and I and I was showing one of my guys this. I said, "So then let's go to the income. Let's actually pull up the statements where it told us to go because AI made it faster. I now no longer needed to flip the 300 pages, but it it gave me where to go.</p>
</details>

到了那里之后，我才能说：“嗯，如果发生了这种情况，那么我们需要查看另一个附注，看看其影响是什么。然后我们还要看现金流量表，看它如何实际影响报告的现金流。” 这些内在联系的建立，AI 或许能让我更快地得到答案，但如果我一开始就不知道我想去哪里，那么 AI 给我的就只是一堆信息。如果我没有一个明确的目标，这些信息对我的决策毫无帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now I went there and now I could say well that means if that is what's happened then we need to look at this other note to see what you know the implications of that and then we got to look at the cash flow statement to see how it's actually impacting what ends up being reported as as cash flow and so those linkages come it the AI makes me get to the answer perhaps more quickly but it's my if I don't already know where I want to go then AI just gives me information, but that information doesn't help my decision if I didn't start with where I want to get to.</p>
</details>

### 经验的不可替代性与技能的退化

如果投资者都依赖 AI，我反而很高兴。初级分析师的工作，比如“帮我找出所有公司资本化成本的参考资料”，将会被 AI 取代。AI 可以做到这一点，我承认。但你需要有经验的人来判断哪些参考资料是重要的，以及它们对业务意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100%. This is I love it. If that's where investors go and that's where they're going, everything is going to AI. The the bottom level of being an analyst, the junior analyst is is going to be replaced by an AI. the one that said, "Find me all the references of, you know, where the company capitalized costs." That the AI can do. I get it. But you need someone with experience to know what which of those references matter and to what that means to the business.</p>
</details>

这带来了一系列挑战。如果那个初级员工没有机会从底层做起，他们就永远学不会如何建立那些联系。唯一的学习方式就是深入细节，亲身实践。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this brings about a number of challenges because well if that junior person doesn't learn doesn't get on the in on the ground floor they'll never learn to be able to make all those connections and the only way to learn is sort of like being in the weeds and not being in a Yes. In fact, it ties to so many things.</p>
</details>

这和我对孩子的教育方式类似。我们上小学时，必须背诵乘法表。我记得我当时在九九乘法表和十二乘法表上挣扎了很久，必须把它们背下来。但轮到我的孩子们时，他们开始用计算器，而且学校似乎也觉得没问题。我对此大发雷霆，我说：“你不能用计算器。你必须先学会不用计算器怎么算，然后才能用它。” 这和 AI 的道理是一样的。你需要先理解财务报表是如何编制的，理解其中的内在联系，建立心智模型，这样当 AI 给你信息时，你才能消化它并做出决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I with my own children I've seen growing up when we went to school and we were in elementary school, we would be, you know, we'd have to do the math tables and and recite them. Yeah. 2 * 2 is four and so on. I remember I was struggled with my with my nine times table and then my 12 times table and so I had to memorize them and get them going. But then my children came along and they were using a calculator and apparently that was okay. I went bananas. I said, "You're not going to use the calculator. You need to learn it without the calculator and then you can use the calculator, which is the same with AI. You need to understand how the financial statements are prepared, understand the linkages, develop mental models so that when the AI gives you information, you can you can digest it and make decisions.</p>
</details>

经验教会你判断力。正如你在书中所说，这一切都关乎心智模型。我坚信这一点。经验告诉你数字的真正含义。当你拥有经验时，你会说：“这个我以前见过。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. Experience teaches you judgment. And and you talk about this in your book. It's all about the mental models. I I I believe that strongly. The experience teaches you what the numbers mean as we've spoken about. And when you have experience, you say, "I've seen that before."</p>
</details>

我今天看到的很多事情，都与我过去 30 年职业生涯初期见过的事情有关联。我认为这是 AI 无法做到的，除非你告诉它去哪里找，因为它不知道我脑海中正在建立的那个联系。但如果我能完成最初的构想阶段，AI 可以帮助我更快、更准确地到达目的地。可如果我一开始就没有一个关于我要寻找什么的模型，AI 是无法帮我找到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a lot of the things I see happening today link back to things I've seen when I started my career over the last 30 years. And I think that's something that the AI can't quite do unless you tell it where to look because it doesn't know the link that I'm thinking about, right? But if I if I can make the initial stage, it can help me get there quicker and more accurately. But if I don't if I don't already have a model of what I'm looking for, it's not going to get there.</p>
</details>

### 当前的市场狂热：泡沫正在形成？

我认为我们正处在一个极度亢奋的时期，数字和基本面似乎都不重要了。“基本面”这个词在投资界被滥用，就像“爱”这个词在人际关系中一样。有人看图表，看到一个双底形态，就说这是基本面。有人看相对强弱指数 (RSI) 或其他指标。有人只看现金流，有人看市盈率。这些都被称为“基本面”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're in uh what seems to be, you know, and I I hate calling things bubbles, but I think we're in a period of extreme uh euphoria where the numbers, the fundamentals, and fundamentals is thrown around in the investment industry like the the word love is thrown around among humans. You know, the fundamentals, well, someone looks at the chart and sees that, you know, it did a double bottom. Well, that's the fundamentals. And someone else says, you know, that they're looking at the RSI or some other things or someone else says they're just looking at cash flow or someone's looking at the multiple related to earnings. And those are the fundamentals.</p>
</details>

但从历史上看，如果我们遵循巴菲特的说法，一家公司的价值是其未来现金流的现值。如何预测这些现金流？你需要对驱动业务的因素进行预测。这才是基本面。所以，当一家公司今天几乎不产生**自由现金流**（Free cash flow: 公司通过运营产生的现金，减去资产支出成本），甚至是负的，而市场却愿意以其收入的倍数来给它估值时，那么这家公司的估值就脱离了当前的基本面，完全基于未来的某些预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, at the, you know, historically, and if we follow what what Buffett says, the company is the present value of its future cash flows. And how do you develop those cash flows? Well, you need to do a forecast on what it's what what it's going to drive the business. And so, that's what I think the fundamentals are. And so when a company today is not generating much in free cash impact negative and yet the market wants to trade it at a multiple of its revenues well then the company's valuations is extracted from its current fundamentals and trading based on some future expectations.</p>
</details>

我所知道的是，当我听到投资者说数字不重要、财务报表不重要，因为“这正在改变世界”时，我会说：“嗯，我以前见过这种情况。” 我看到过 Nortel、Lucent、Cisco 和 360networks 改变世界。它们构建了我们今天使用的互联网基础设施，但这些公司如今已不复存在。它们建造的东西还在，但它们自己要么破产，要么被其他公司吞并。Cisco 今天依然存在，但其股价再也未能回到历史高点，尽管它的盈利和收入比那时高出许多倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all I know is I've seen that when you read and speak to investors and they say that the numbers don't matter and the financial statements no longer matter because this is changing the world. I say, "Well, I've seen this before." You know, I saw that Nortell was changing the world and Lucent and Cisco and 360 networks. They were building out the infrastructure of the internet that we're using today. But those companies don't exist anymore. They built what they built and that still exists, but they no longer exist. Either bankrupt or folded into other companies. Cisco still exists today, but has never traded at it at its historical uh valuation. And yet, it's a it's it's a multiples bigger than it was back then and by earnings and by revenue.</p>
</details>

### 高风险环境下的低风险定价

我们知道这是未来，但我们同样不知道谁会是赢家。我认为现在我们处于一个非常高风险的境地，因为风险的成本被定价得非常低，而这恰恰是风险最高的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess what you're saying is the same is we know this is the future, but it's also the same in that we don't know who the winners are going to be. That's right. And and I think right now the reason why I think we're in a in a very high-risisk situation is because the cost of the risk is priced very low and that's when the risk is highest.</p>
</details>

我们如何看待这一点？看看**高收益债券利差**（High-yield bond spread: 高收益或“垃圾”债券与政府债券之间的收益率差异，是衡量市场风险偏好的指标）。美国 10 年期国债与高收益债券（非投资级债券）之间的利差，目前接近历史最窄水平。这意味着投资者愿意以几乎是历史上最低的溢价，将钱借给非投资级公司。所以，债券市场几乎没有为风险定价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so how do we look at that? When you look at the uh the high yield bond spread, the spread between the 10-year bond and the high yield bond in the US, okay, that's the non-investment grade bonds. Well, that's the tightest, near the tightest it's ever been, which means that investors are willing to lend money to non-investment grade companies at a spread over what a government bond is at a rate, which is the tightest it's been practically in history. So there's no risk priced into the bond market.</p>
</details>

在股票市场，我们使用 **VIX**（Volatility Index: 波动率指数，衡量市场对未来 30 天 S&P 500 指数波动性的预期），它目前处于一个温和的水平。虽然不是历史最低，但也处于良性水平。所以，投资者实际上在说：没有风险，一切都很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in the equity markets, we use VIX, which is a measure of volatility of the of the S&P 500. And that is trading at a benign level. It's not the lowest it's ever been, but it's at a benign level. So in essence, what investors are saying is there's no risk. Everything's fine.</p>
</details>

### 历史重演：AI 时代的循环融资

在互联网泡沫时期，你有像 Nortel、Cisco 和 Lucent 这样的公司，它们在建设互联网的各个组成部分。它们需要客户，而这些客户需要筹集资金，因为建设基础设施在一段时间内是不会产生现金流的。所以客户会从股权持有人那里筹集资金，并最终获得一些债务。但像 Lucent 和 Nortel 这样的巨头也会向它们提供资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at the time you had Nortell and you had Cisco and you had Lucent and they were building out various components parts of the internet and what they would do was they needed customers. Well the customers needed to raise money cuz if you're going to build infrastructure you're not going to generate cash flow for some time. So they would raise money from equity holders and eventually get some debt but the powers that be at Lucent and Nortell would also offer them.</p>
</details>

它们会说：“买我们价值 1000 万美元的产品，你可以用很长的时间来付款。哦，顺便说一下，我们再给你一笔信贷额度。你需要我们的 1000 万美元电缆，但你可能还需要从思科买一些路由器。没问题，我们给你信贷额度来做这件事。” 因为 Nortel 自身有强大的资产负债表，可以轻松融资。这就是当时发生的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they would say buy this $10 million worth of product and why don't you pay me over some extended period of time. Oh, and by the way, we'll give you a line of credit so that you need 10 million from us of of cable. Uh, but we'll you can also you need to buy some routers from Cisco. You know what? We'll give you some line of credit so you could do that because Nortto could borrow money could could had a great balance sheet could raise money whatever. And so that's what was happening.</p>
</details>

最终，当股票市场开始动摇，再也没有人可以继续销售产品时，Nortel 突然收不回它的债务，整个体系就崩溃了。360networks 和 JDS Uniphase 也随之倒下。

<p class="english-text">Well, ultimately when the equity market started to wobble and there was no one left to continue to make sales to, right? Well, then now all of a sudden Nortell didn't get paid on its debts and the wheels came off and then the 360 networks and JDS unif mentioned they went by the wayside.</p>
</details>

现在，让我们把这个模式应用到今天。你有像 Nvidia 和微软这样的公司，还有 OpenAI 等。Nvidia 投资 OpenAI，微软也是 OpenAI 的投资者。微软向 OpenAI 提供云服务，所以 OpenAI 是微软的客户。但微软给了它钱，让它能反过来付钱给自己。Nvidia 投资 OpenAI，同时又是 OpenAI 的芯片供应商。这完全是循环的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so what ended up sort of now let's take that and think about what's happening today. So you have the likes of the Nvidias of the world and let's say Microsoft and you have Open AI and such and Nvidia is investing in Open AI. And Microsoft is an investor in Open AI. Microsoft offers cloud services to Open AI. So it's a customer. So OpenAI becomes a customer of Microsoft. But Microsoft gave it the money so that it could actually pay it back. Nvidia invests in OpenAI and Nvidia is a a a supplier of chips to open AAI. So it's all circular. What's going on here?</p>
</details>

有一家今年早些时候上市的新公司 CoreWeave，它最大的客户是谁？微软。CoreWeave 提供基于芯片的数据处理分析，是像微软这样的大型 AI 用户的数据中心。微软没有直接投资它，但 Nvidia 几乎供应了它所有的芯片。而 Nvidia 是 CoreWeave 的一个重要投资者。CoreWeave 上市时，在最后时刻，Nvidia 购买了价值 2.5 亿美元的股票，以帮助它完成交易。JP Morgan 在它上市前给了它一笔贷款，上市后它又用融到的钱偿还了 JP Morgan 的贷款，而 JP Morgan 正是其主承销商之一。

<p class="english-text">There's a new company that just went public earlier this year, Cororeweave, who is its largest customer. Coreeave provides data transaction like analysis of on chips, right? It's a data farm for the large AI users like Microsoft. Its largest customer is Microsoft. Microsoft hasn't invested in it, but Nvidia supplies pretty much all its chips. Well, Nvidia is a large or is a meaningful investor in Coreave. Corewave goes public. It's trying to close its its equity, its financing. on the last moment, Nvidia buys $250 million worth of shares of Cororeweave so that it could close the deal. These are, you know, JP Morgan gives them a loan so that they could just before they go public and then they go public and repay the loan to JP Morgan who's the one of the lead underwriters, JP Morgan.</p>

### 从红旗到“可燃项”：三阶段分析法

人们问我寻找哪些“红旗”。我喜欢你提问的方式，因为它引出了我们长期以来学到的东西。红旗的问题在于，你不想总是“狼来了”。所以我学会了克制，因为你可能是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the red flags you look for? I like the way you you posed the question because it sets up what I we've learned over time. The problem with red flags is it gets to your point that you started at before where you don't want to be crying wolf. And so I've learned to temper because you could be wrong.</p>
</details>

我们不称之为红旗，我们称之为“可燃项”(flammable items)。这是我们使用并传授的一个三阶段流程。第一阶段是理解业务和控制环境，以及所使用的会计方法。这样，当你研究财务报表时，一切才有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not red flags. We call them flammable items. So this goes to the pro our process. It's a three-stage process that we use and we teach because one of our we have Veritasu and so we teach investors how to make better investment decisions. And so the the first stage is you understand the business and the control environment. Okay, again understand and understand the accounting that's being used so that when you study the financial statements, everything else, they all make sense and you understand sort of the the the structure, how is management compensated, what stage of their life cycle are they at? Because those are all sort of constraints and opportunities within the business.</p>
</details>

然后你寻找可燃项。例如，公司产生负现金流。在传统观念中，这本身可能就是一个红旗。但如果一家公司正在投资一个将带来巨大机会的 AI 初创公司，并且它过往的投资资本回报率超过 20% 或 50%，那么今天的负现金流可能是一件好事。我投资的是未来的现金流，而不是今天的。所以，如果你把它看作一个红旗而不去投资，你就错了。除非你理解了第一部分，即它所处的生命周期、业务类型等，否则它就不是一个红旗，只是一个单独的可燃项，本身不是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then you look for a flammable item. For example, companies generating negative cash flow. That could be by itself a red flag in the normal way. This this type of I would call forensic analysis is taught unless you know. So if a company's generating negative cash, it may actually be a fantastic thing. They're investing in an AI startup that is going to be a huge opportunity. and they've shown over time that the return on invested capital is in excess of 20% or 50% or whatever it is. And so they're investing in something. Yes, it's negative cash flow today. But I'm not investing for the cash flow today. I'm investing for the cash flow tomorrow. So you see that as a red flag, you don't invest in it. And unless you understood the first part, which was the fact that where they are in their life cycle, type of business, etc., that is now not a red flag. It's just a flammable item by itself. Not a problem.</p>
</details>

然后你进入第三个桶，也就是“火花”(spark)。你总是在寻找火花。让我们回到那个负现金流的例子。如果突然有一个新的竞争对手进入了该公司的运营领域，并能够抢占市场份额，那么现在，那个负现金流就成了一个问题。如果你注意到公司为了弥补负现金流而承担了非常昂贵的债务，这本身也不一定意味着什么，因为如果潜在的投资回报率高于资本成本，一切都好。但如果一个新的竞争者出现，那么这个模型可能就不再奏效了。现在，你就面临着一场爆雷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It depends. And then you get to the third bucket, which is the spark. And so you're always looking for a spark because let's use that same negative cash flow. Well, if all of a sudden a new competitor comes into that company's operating space, okay, and is able to take market share, now all of a sudden that negative cash flow is a problem. If you notice in the financial statements when you look at that negative cash flow, the company's taken on very expensive debt. Again, very expensive debt by itself doesn't mean anything because if the potential return on invested capital is higher than that cost of capital, it's all good. But if a new peer comes in play, now all of a sudden that model may not work. And now you have a blowup.</p>

### Valiant 案例：聪明投资者为何会犯错

我们曾发布报告建议卖出 Valiant，当时我们是唯一持此观点的机构。那是 2012、2013 年，公司直到 2015 年才爆雷。他们谈论自己的诚信，以及如何通过药物重构来改变世界。但如果你深入研究，会发现他们只是在操纵会计，改变药品定价，并建立了一个欺诈性的在线网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We wrote about Valiant. We said sell Valiant. Okay? We're the only cell on on Valiant in 2012 2013. The company didn't blow up until 2015. Okay? But they and they would talk about their integrity and their, you know, how they were changing the world with the with the drug reformulations they were doing and so forth. But if you look deeper, they were just manipulating the accounting and changing the pricing on on drugs and creating a fraudulent network of onlineies.</p>
</details>

为什么那么多知名且备受尊敬的投资者都错了？这些人以尽职调查和勤奋著称。我知道，我曾和他们坐下来谈过。这是一个 CEO 和管理团队极其擅长讲故事的案例。CEO 迈克·皮尔森 (Mike Pearson) 履历光鲜，他不拿薪水，所有回报都与股价挂钩。他不知疲倦地为公司工作，并且他证明了自己，因为价格创造了叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did so many well-known wellrespected investors go wrong? People who are known for their due diligence, people who are known for their leg work. I know I sat with them talked to them before the c before it's a situation where someone is such a masterful spinner of a story and is the CEO and the management team sold you had Mike Pearson. and was executing and you know he comes he came from a great pedigree. He was not taking a salary and everything was tied to the stock price. you know, he he was, you know, for tires tirelessly working in the company and he'd proven because what ends up happening is price creates narrative.</p>
</details>

第一天你可能不相信，但你看到他们完成了一项收购，起初看起来行不通，但后来成功了，股价更高了。然后他们又做了些别的事情，看起来有点奇怪。他们改变了会计方法，改变了非公认会计准则 (non-GAAP) 指标的呈现方式——这是我们注意到的另一个巨大的可燃项。公司会用一种方式计算调整后的 **EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 息税折旧及摊销前利润），下一年又换一种方式。这是一个未经审计的数字，管理层想怎么算就怎么算，市场就信了。Valiant 在这方面臭名昭著，但这没关系，因为股价一直在涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of a sudden you don't believe it day one, but then you see that they made an acquisition. It didn't seem like it was going to work, but then it works and the stock price goes higher and then they do something else and it kind of seems a little bit strange. And then they changed their accounting and and they changed the way they rec they they present their op their uh non-gash gap metrics which is things we noticed like that's another huge flammable item. The company says you know they're reporting their they use an adjusted IBIDA and they calculate it in a certain way and then the following year they calculate it a different way. Well that's a non audited number. It's a it's whatever management wants and you know the markets just believe it. And so that's something that Valiant was notorious about, but didn't matter because the stock price just kept going higher.</p>
</details>

当股价持续上涨时，坚持己见变得非常困难。在基金管理行业，当你表现不佳时，坚持自己的路线是极其困难的。就像电影《大空头》里的人物一样，他们当时被认为是疯子。你最终会看着自己，觉得自己疯了，我看到了这些问题，但没人在乎。这变得非常困难。

### 结构、激励与人性的弱点

公司不会一开始就是 crooked（不诚实的）。它们必须说服某人购买产品或服务。问题在于，外部利益相关者进来，说：“我需要你达到 X 的业绩，因为你想要我的钱。只要你给我这个回报，我就给你钱。” 这在一切顺利时没问题。但没有哪个 CEO 愿意让人失望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">companies don't start out as being crooked. They have to convince someone to buy a product okay or a service. So money comes in to the company in some fashion or time and then gets converted into something that adds value. The problem becomes outside stakeholders come in and say, "Well, I need you to make X because you want my money. Well, I'll give you my money so long as you give me this return." Well, that works until there's a problem. And now there's no CEO that wants to disappoint.</p>
</details>

很简单。CFO 来找我（CEO），说：“安东尼，我知道我们原计划赚 1 美元，但现在看来只能到 95 美分。” 我会对他说：“你回到你的办公室，给我找出那 5 美分来。” 你喜欢你的工作，喜欢你的孩子上私立学校，喜欢你的股票期权值多少钱。我们有这么多员工，每个季度都给他们发股票作为薪酬的一部分。我们不能让人失望。然后，一切就开始了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's very simple. The CFO comes to talk to me. I'm the CEO. And he says, "Look, I know uh Anthony, we were going to make a dollar, but we're coming in at 95." And I say to him, "You get back to your room and find me 5 cents." You like your job. You like your kids going to private school. You like your stock options, how much they're worth. You see all these employees we have, they we give them stock as a part of their compensation every quarter. Like that's a problem. We can't disappoint. And then it starts</p>
</details>

它总是缓慢开始的。就像安迪·法斯托（安然前 CFO）在采访中所说：“它从一点点开始，我以为下个季度就能补回来。” 生活就是这样危险。无论是在生活中推迟某件事，还是撒个小谎，没人注意到，就觉得没关系。然后你可能会做得更多一点，还是没人注意，一切都很好，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It always starts slowly. And look, there that was what Andy said in in the I think correct those interviews. It's like, you know, it started with a little bit and I figured next quarter I could bring it back and it's just, you know, that's the thing. Life is a dangerous thing this way. Whether we push something even in life, right? You know, well, look, if I smoke a bit or drink a bit or tell this little lie, you know, no one notices and I'm I'm okay. Well, then maybe I do a little bit more of each one of those things and no one notices and then it's all good, right?</p>

### 股票期权与回购的真相

我个人讨厌上市公司使用股票期权。我看大多数股票回购，它们只是在掩盖股票期权带来的稀释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hate them personally in public companies. However, I I understand why companies want to use them. I mean, my take is there, you know, if you look at most buybacks, they're just covering up stock options. Correct. Very good.</p>
</details>

股票期权归根结底是人类的激励机制。如果我根据股价来补偿你，你就会做出能推动股价的决策。我认为股票期权应该被视为费用。巴菲特也说过类似的话，如果它不是费用，那它是什么？你可以选择用股票期权支付某人，也可以选择用现金支付。如果我们是竞争对手，你用股票期权支付所有员工，我用现金。我的 EBITDA 和每股收益都比你低，你的股票交易价格比我的高。但如果股价下跌，你所有的员工都会离开，想来为我工作。而我的员工则很开心，他们不在乎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that uh stock options what they do every it comes down to human motivation. So if I am going to compensate you on the stock price, then you're going to make decisions that move the stock price. I think stock options should be an expense and if they're not an expense I I borrow from Buffett and even the chair of accounting has said things like this that that if it's not an expense then what is it? You can choose to pay someone in stock options or you can choose to pay them in cash. So if I pay all my employees, you pay, you have the same company, you're we're a competitor. You pay all your employees with stock options. I pay them in cash. I have a lower EBIDA. I have a lower EPS. Your stock trades higher than mine. Stock price goes down. All of a sudden, all your employees leave and they want to come work for me. And all my guys are pretty happy. They don't care.</p>
</details>

至于股票回购，当公司回购股票时，它是在投资一种证券。它对这种证券的部分行为有控制权，但无法完全控制其投资价值的走向。相比之下，如果它用现金购买一项能扩大现有生产的运营资产，并且该资产已经能产生可观的回报，那么这个回报应该会持续并扩大。所以对我来说，回购股票等于在说：“我在自己的业务中找不到任何能产生高于资本成本回报的投资了。” 我认为这非常危险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you buy back stock, the company is making a investment in a security. Which it partially has control over what it does, but it doesn't have full control over what happens to that investment value. Whereas if it takes its cash and buys an an operating asset that expands its current production and if it's already generating a meaningful return, then that return should continue and expand. So to me, it's a it's a point that says I have no other investments in my business that would generate a return higher than my cost of capital. And so I'm going out and buying my stock and I think that is very risky.</p>
</details>

### 投资的终极智慧：结构与心态

巴菲特之所以能在 2008 年那样的危机中行动，而其他人却陷入瘫痪，是因为他建立了一个能产生现金的业务结构。他有像 Geico 这样的运营公司，这些公司产生现金，他拿着这些现金，在他想投资的时候，以他想投资的方式进行投资。普通的投资组合经理做不到这一点，因为他们每天都被衡量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buffett has built a business that generates cash so he has operating businesses Gecko Pulum etc these generate cash he takes that cash and invests it when he wants to invest it in the way that he wants to invest it. You know, the average portfolio manager can't do that because they're tied to they have to like today in the investment management industry, portfolio managers are measured like on a daily basis there.</p>
</details>

结构决定了策略能否成功。巴菲特之所以能做他今天所做的事，是因为他控制了大量的股份。这种结构使他能够贯彻自己的策略。在伯克希尔漫长的历史中，有很多时候激进投资者会介入，要求返还资本，要求借债回购股票，但正是这种结构阻止了这一切的发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Part of the reason that Berkshire was able to do that and Buffett was able to act is that or Buffett's able to do what he's doing today is he controls so much of the shares. So he's got the structure to enable the strategy to play out. Whereas if you think about it, you know, there's many times during Brook Birkshshire's uh long career where an investor, an activist investor would have come in, demanded they return capital, demanded they take on debt to buy back shares, and the structure that's enabled so much success has also prevented that.</p>
</details>

当市场下跌时，你不应该担心或害怕。我今年早些时候去了一趟中国，那次旅行几乎改变了我的人生。我发现，在他们的屏幕上，下跌的股票是绿色的，上涨的股票是红色的。你应该这样重新设置你的屏幕。因为如果你每天醒来看到一片红色，就像我们在 2008 年经历的那样，你会感到恐惧。但想象一下，如果每天都是绿色的，你会想：“哦，这很有趣。” 如果每天上涨都是红色的，你会想：“嗯，我不确定，这样还好吗？” 一切都关乎心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when if the market falls uh or or suffers some kind of setback, you shouldn't be concerned. You shouldn't be you shouldn't be scared. In fact, I I did a trip to China uh life-changing practically earlier this year. I'd never been before. And um when I went to China, I if you go and in the and I um met with analysts there and taught them our our training process. And if you when they when they look at their screen, stocks that are down are green, stocks that are up are red. That's how you should rejig screen. In fact, I called fact set in and Bloomberg and see if we can change that. Because if you look wake up every day and everything's red and you like we lived this in '08, right? It went lower and you thought, "Okay, I'll buy some now." And then it went lower two early 2000 and then it went lower until you don't know what that feels like until you go through it. But imagine if every day it was green. You go, "Oh, this is interesting." And if every day it was going up, it was red. You'd go, "Hm, I'm not sure. Is this okay? Is everything okay? It might be, but it's just everything's a mindset, right?</p>
