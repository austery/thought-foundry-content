### 节目介绍与嘉宾登场

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 作为此彭博播客的订阅用户，我们认为您可能会对一个赞助播客“Evolving Money”感兴趣，该播客由Coinbase和Bloomberg Media Studios制作。它解释了机构投资者如何采用世界上最新的资产类别——加密货币。这是一期近期节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Since you're a subscriber to this Bloomberg podcast, we thought you'd be interested in a sponsored podcast called Evolving Money, produced by Coinbase and Bloomberg Media Studios. It explains how institutional investors are adopting the world's newest asset class, crypto. Here's a recent episode.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 在过去的15年里，加密货币社区一直存在很多沮丧，因为华尔街和金融服务行业忽视了加密货币，或者干脆反对它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: There's been a lot of frustration in the crypto community over the past 15 years because the the Wall Street and financial services industries have ignored crypto or outright been opposed to it.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 这位是Rick Edelman，一位长期的金融顾问和金融界播客主持人，他是开启本期“Evolving Money”节目的完美嘉宾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: That's Rick Edelman, a longtime financial adviser and podcaster in the financial world and the perfect guest to kick off this episode of Evolving Money.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 在早期，对加密货币存在如此敌意是有原因的，因为它不是由华尔街发明的，而华尔街不喜欢它不控制和不拥有的东西。所以，如果可能就压制它，如果不行就忽视它。他们在这一点上 pretty successfully 做了10年。但最终，他们开始意识到它将留存下来。哦，对了，这项技术实际上 pretty cool。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: The reason that there has been such antipathy uh about crypto in its early years is because it didn't get invented by Wall Street and Wall Street doesn't like what it doesn't control and own. So, better to quash it if you can, ignore it if you can't. And they did that pretty successfully for 10 years. But eventually, they began to realize it's here to stay. And oh, by the way, the technology is in fact pretty cool.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 欢迎来到“Evolving Money”。我是主持人Angie Laauo。我曾作为记者报道金融行业数十年，而这，是迄今为止最大的故事。本节目由Coinbase（全球最大的加密货币平台之一）和Bloomberg Media Studios联合制作。在本系列节目中，我们正在探索加密货币如何被传统金融机构采纳，作为货币系统的下一个逻辑演进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Welcome to Evolving Money. I'm your host, Angie Laauo. I spent decades as a journalist covering the financial industry and well, this is the biggest story yet. This show is co-produced by Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms in the world, and Bloomberg Media Studios. In this series, we are exploring how crypto is being adopted by traditional financial institutions as the next logical evolution of the monetary system.

</details>

### 代币化的兴起与潜力

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 本期节目是关于**代币化**。这是将**真实世界资产或金融工具在区块链上表示**的过程。现在，在不到三年的时间里，代币化资产的总量已增长了八倍，达到300多亿美元，涵盖股票、固定收益、私募资产、房地产等等。而代币化革命仍处于早期阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: This episode is about tokenization. That's the process of representing a real world asset or financial instrument on blockchain. Now, in less than three years, the amount of tokenized assets has grown eight-fold to more than $30 billion US across equities, fixed income, private assets, real estate, and a whole lot more. And the tokenization revolution is still in its early stages.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 最近，我们看到一些最大的传统资产管理公司以一种big way的方式拥抱它。这就是我所说的。**BlackRock**推出了所谓的**Bidd Fund**，基于**Ethereum**。这是一个代币化的货币市场基金，已向合格投资者开放。这些代币的总价值约为28亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Now, recently we've seen some of the largest traditional asset management companies embrace it in a big way. This is what I'm talking about. BlackRockck, they've launched what they call the Bidd Fund on Ethereum. It's a tokenized money market fund they've made available to qualified investors. The total value of those tokens around $2.8 billion.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 然后是**Fidelity**。他们推出了自己的代币化货币市场基金，目前估值超过2亿美元。**JP Morgan**和**Goldman Sachs**。他们也以各种方式向其投资者提供了代币化资产。但他们为什么要这样做呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: And then we've got Fidelity. They've rolled out their own tokenized money market fund currently valued at over $200 million. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. They've also made their tokenized assets available to their investors in various ways. But why are they doing it?

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 嗯，有三个主要驱动因素：**流动性、更广泛的访问权限和运营效率**。我们将与接下来的两位嘉宾一起探讨这三个主题。Rick Edelman，您已经听过他的声音了。他发起了**Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals**，这是第一个帮助金融顾问负责任地驾驭加密货币、区块链和代币化资产的教育平台。他对代币化为市场带来的机遇**uber bullish**。还有Scott Lucas，**JP Morgan**数字资产市场主管。他正积极将代币化和区块链技术整合到JP Morgan的运营中，但他不像Rick那样急于求成。我认为，让他们两人都有机会解释自己的方法对您很重要。我们将从Rick开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Well, there are three main drivers. We've got liquidity, broader access, and operational efficiency. We're going to touch on all three of those topics with our next two guests. Rick Edelman, who you've already heard from. He launched the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, the first educational platform helping financial advisers responsibly navigate crypto, blockchain, and tokenized assets. He's uber bullish on the opportunities tokenization is bringing to the market. And Scott Lucas, head of markets, digital assets with JP Morgan. He's actively integrating tokenization and blockchain technology into JP Morgan's operations, but he isn't in as much of a hurry as Rick is. And I think it's important to give them both a place to explain their approaches for you. We'll start with Rick.

</details>

### 代币化将取代ETF？

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: Rick，就在几个月前，您曾说过，到本世纪末，代币化将成为行业内占主导地位的投资平台，远远超过ETF。我们今天所知的ETF将在五年内不复存在。这是一个相当大胆的预测，Rick。您为什么这么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Now, just a few months ago, Rick, you said that by the end of the decade, tokenization will be the dominant investment platform in the industry. far eclipsing ETFs. ETFs as we know them today really won't exist in five years. That is quite the prediction, Rick. Why do you see that?

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 是的，这听起来确实很重大，但实际上并非如此。它是迭代的。它只是货币管理技术代际演进的下一步。请记住，在过去的20到25年里，ETF已经进入市场，取代了共同基金，而共同基金本身曾是美国人几十年来占主导地位的投资工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: Yeah, it does sound momentous, but it really isn't. It's iterative. Uh it's just the next logical step in technological generation of money management. Uh remember that ETFs have come on the marketplace over the last 20 25 years replacing mutual funds which were themselves the dominant investment vehicle for Americans for decades and decades.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 好的，但共同基金仍然持有大约20万亿美元的资产。这是投资界的一大部分。那么，您为什么认为ETF以及最终的代币化产品会蚕食这部分市场呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Okay, but mutual funds still hold I think about 20 trillion here. That's a huge piece of the investment world. So why do you see ETFs and eventually tokenized products actually eating into that?

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 它们在技术上更优越。ETF全天交易。共同基金只在市场收盘时定价一次。ETF有更好的披露。ETF的税收更低。成本更低。流动性更高。所以自然而然，人们比共同基金更喜欢ETF。代币化也会发生同样的情况。我们将把ETF份额转化为代币，在区块链上进行交易。这将进一步降低成本，进一步提高流动性，进一步扩大您可以投资的资产范围，从而改善您的多元化。那么，有什么不喜欢的呢？就像每个人都从共同基金升级到ETF一样，接下来我们将从ETF升级到代币。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: They're simply technologically superior. Uh ETFs trade throughout the day. Mutual funds you are only priced once when the market closes. ETFs have better disclosure. ETFs are lower in taxation. They're lower in cost. They're higher in liquidity. So naturally, people love ETFs over mutual funds. The same thing's going to happen with tokenization. We're going to take those ETF shares and turn them into tokens which will trade on blockchains. This will further reduce the costs, further increase the liquidity, further increase the uh broad array of assets available for you to invest in, improving your diversification. So, what's not to love? So, just as everybody graduated from mutual funds to ETFs, next we're going to go from ETFs to tokens.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 客户想要吗？他们理解吗？因为归根结底，如果客户不想要，银行就不会创造产品。嗯，我们都记得史蒂夫·乔布斯，他曾说过，他从不进行焦点小组测试，因为没有人能理解他正在发明的那些产品。那么，他们怎么能有有效的意见呢？嗯，这与区块链技术也是一样。人们不理解它，所以他们怎么会喜欢它呢？换句话说，我们要做的是开发技术，在这个平台上推出产品，消费者将很快发现它更快、更便宜、更安全，并且具有更高的透明度和包容性。所以，他们会接受并适应它，因为它将为他们提供目前所缺乏的巨大好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Do customers want it? Do they understand it? Because at the end of the day, if the customer doesn't want it, the bank is not going to create the product. Well, we we all remember Steve Jobs who famously said he never engaged in focus group testing because nobody understood the products he was inventing. So, how could they have a valid opinion? Uh, and it's the same thing with blockchain technology. People don't understand it, and so how can they like it? In other words, all we're going to do is develop the technology, introduce the products on that platform, and consumers will quickly discover it's faster, cheaper, safer with greater transparency and inclusion. So, they will move and adopt to this because it's simply going to offer them tremendous benefits that they currently lack.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 现在，我们只能在周一到周五交易股票，不包括节假日和周末，从上午9:30到下午4点。这太傻了。为什么我们不能24/7、365天进行交易？为什么我们不能即时完成？就像你去超市买一条面包，付完钱就拿到面包一样。为什么我们不能用IBM的股票做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Right now, we can only trade stocks Monday through Friday, excluding holidays and weekends, from 9:30 to 4 in the afternoon. That's silly. Why aren't we able to do this 24/7, 365? Why aren't we able to do it instantaneously? Like when you go to a supermarket to buy a loaf of bread, you walk out with a bread as soon as you pay for it. Why can't we do that with shares of IBM?

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 您还记得2019年，我们当时都在这个领域，但世界上第一个房地产代币化想法之一浮出水面，那是在Aspen。是St. Regis。他们正在进行度假村大型销售的**分拆**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: You remember back in 2019, we we were both in the space then, but one of the world's first real estate tokenization ideas came to light and it was in Aspen. It was St. Regis. They were fractionalizing uh the sale of their big resort

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 我认为其中五分之一卖了1800万美元，Rick？你还记得吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: and I think a fifth of it went for I think was it $18 million, Rick? Do you remember?

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 是的。而且是10美元一股。是的。嗯，每个代币都是10美元。那实际上是第二次交易。第一次是在一年前，曼哈顿的一个公寓楼被代币化了。嗯，想想这件事的奇妙之处。你看，房地产最大的问题，我们都知道，就是购买成本非常高，而且流动性很差。我的意思是，我们都知道买卖房子有多难，相比之下买卖英伟达的股票就容易多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: Yeah. And it were 10 they were 10 bucks a piece. Yeah. Uh each of the tokens and that was actually the second transaction. The first one was a year earlier, a condo building in Manhattan tokenized. Uh, and and just think about the wonder of this. See, the big problem with real estate, as we all know, is that it's very expensive to buy and it's highly illquid. I mean, we all know how hard it is to buy and sell a house compared to buying and selling shares of Nvidia.

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 所以，代币化过程出现了，他们可以把这个数百万美元的资产分成每份10美元的代币。突然之间，那些以前从未能够购买商业或投资性房地产的人现在可以了，因为代币的价格便宜，而且交易流动性很高。这以前所未有的规模向散户投资者开放了商业房地产领域。这是一个大事件，因为全球房地产市场的规模是全球股市的三倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: So, along comes the tokenization process where they could take this multi-million dollar asset and split it into tokens of $10 a piece. All of a sudden, people who never were able to buy commercial or investable real estate now can because the price of the token is cheap and it trades with great liquidity. This opens up the commercial real estate sector to retail investors in a scale never before seen. This is a big deal because the real estate market globally is three times bigger than the global stock market.

</details>

### 区块链为银行节省成本

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: Rick，我明白代币化使交易更直接。它使交易更快。它减少了管理费用，所有这些。但现实地说，实际上，使用加密货币轨道能为银行节省多少管理费用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: So Rick, I get it that tokenization makes transactions more straightforward. It makes them quicker. It reduces overhead, all of that, but realistically, I mean, actually, how much money will using crypto rails save the banks in overhead?

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 你可以看看**Kinesis**，这是一个由**JP Morgan**创建的区块链，每天处理20亿美元的跨境汇款。自四年前构思以来，它已在全球范围内转移了超过4万亿美元，因为他们认识到，与使用我们用于货币管理的联邦系统（如Swift系统）相比，他们可以为机构客户更快、更便宜、更轻松地转移资金。所以，每个人都开始认识到，这比我们迄今为止使用的技术要好。它提供了巨大的商业利益，节省了大量资金。JP Morgan表示，区块链每年将为银行节省1200亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: So you look at Kinesis, which uh is a blockchain created by JP Morgan that does $2 billion a day in crossber transmitts. They've moved over $4 trillion worldwide since it was conceived four years ago because they recognize they can move money for their institutional clients faster, cheaper, and easier than they can using the federal uh systems that we use in money management such as the Swift system. So, everybody's beginning to recognize that this is better technology than the technology we've been using to date. It offers big business benefits, saving lots of money. JP Morgan says that blockchain will save banks $120 billion a year.

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 所以，您现在处于这样一个阶段：十分之九的银行都在开发区块链技术。三分之二的财富500强公司都在开发这项技术，并且在接下来的12到24个月里，您将看到它们全部开始部署，这将是一个指数增长曲线。传统的曲棍球棒曲线。嗯，人们将对市场上的采用和实施速度感到震惊。它似乎会凭空出现，但它将像披头士乐队一样，他们花了六年时间才成为一夜成名的成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: So you're now at the stage where nine out of 10 banks are developing blockchain technology. Two out of three Fortune 500 companies are developing the technology and over the next 12 to 24 months you're going to see all of them begin to deploy and it's going to be an exponential growth curve. traditional hockey stick. Uh, and people are going to be shocked at the speed of adoption and implementation in the marketplace. Uh, it's going to appear to have come out of nowhere, but it's going to be like the Beatles where they spent, you know, six years becoming an overnight success.

</details>

### 未来愿景：万物皆可代币化

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: Rick，接下来是什么？我们有机构投资者入场。我们有BlackRock、Franklin Templeton、JPM。所有这些人都在进入这个领域。五年后会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Rick, what's next? We have the institutionals coming in. We have the BlackRockck, the Franklin Templeton, uh, JPM. All of these folks are coming into this space. How will this look in 5 years?

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 嗯，一切都将被代币化。不仅仅是股票、债券、房地产等金融资产。而是万物都将被代币化。例如，您的驾照和护照。我们为什么要随身携带一张塑料卡片？这太荒谬了。您的雇佣记录、您的学业记录、您的健康记录都将成为代币，让您更容易与医疗行业打交道，或者在您申请工作或试图租房时。您将能够代币化您的房屋。我们都知道房屋是大多数美国人的头号资产，但他们不想在退休时出售房屋来产生收入。他们想继续住在那里。所以，通过代币化您的房屋，您可以将那价值百万美元的房屋，创建100万个每份一美元的代币，现在您可以根据需要一次出售它们来为自己创造收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: Well, everything is going to be tokenized. Uh not just financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, uh and and other. But everything is going to be tokenized. For example, your driver's license and passport. Why are we carrying a piece of plastic in our in our wallet or purse? That's ridiculous. uh your employment records, your academic records, your health records will all be tokens, making it easier for you to deal with the medical industry or when you're applying for a job or trying to rent an apartment. Uh you're going to uh be able to tokenize your home. We all know that homes are the number one asset for most Americans, but they don't want to sell their house when they're retired to generate income. They want to keep living there. So, well, by tokenizing your house, you can take that million-doll home, create 1 million tokens of a dollar each, and now you can sell them off one at a time as you wish to generate income for yourself.

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 投资者会想要购买它，因为他们会想要拥有一部分您的房屋，因为您住在一个很棒的社区，拥有一项增值的资产。所以，我们还将代币化薪水。例如，您已经可以购买一个代币，它代表着一位职业运动员、您最喜欢的四分卫，或者您最喜欢的好莱坞明星，或者您最喜欢的录音艺术家的一份合同。您可以购买他们音乐目录的一个代币。所以，与其成为Taylor Swift的粉丝，您将能够与她一起成为她音乐的所有者，这样您就可以通过享受您最喜欢的广播节目、好莱坞电影或百老汇戏剧来赚钱。这将是万物代币化。我们将能够将所有这些真实世界资产转化为数字表示，您可以拥有、交易并作为爱好来享受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: Investors will want to buy it because they're going to want to own a piece of your home because you live in a great community with an appreciating asset. So, we're also going to tokenize salaries. For example, you can already buy a uh into a token that is a contract of a professional athlete, your favorite quarterback or your favorite Hollywood celebrity or your favorite recording artist. You you can buy a token of their music catalog. So instead of being a fan of Taylor Swift, you'll be able to be an owner of her music along with her so that you're earning money by enjoying your favorite radio show or Hollywood movie or Broadway play. This is going to be the tokenization of everything. We're going to be able to take all these real world assets and create digital representations of them that you'll be able to own and trade and enjoy as a hobby.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 那是Rick Edelman，他对此代币化的潜力感到非常兴奋。然而，我的下一位嘉宾持有更审慎的观点。Scott Lucas是**JP Morgan**的市场数字资产主管，JP Morgan是世界上最大的银行，也是贸易公司中区块链使用的领导者。Scott是该领域的专家和领导者，他最近监督了一笔引起我注意的非常大的交易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: That's Rick Edelman and what he sees makes him highly enthusiastic about the potential of tokenization. My next guest, however, has a more measured perspective. Scott Lucas is the head of markets digital assets for JP Morgan, the world's largest bank and a leader in blockchain usage amongst tradey firms. Scott is an expert and a leader in this space and he recently oversaw a very large transaction that caught my attention.

</details>

### JP Morgan的审慎视角

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 2025年末，JP Morgan作为**Galaxy Digital**的5000万美元美国商业票据发行**安排方**，在Salena的**公有区块链**上进行了发行。Galaxy Digital是一家全球性的加密货币金融服务和基础设施公司，发行了代币化的商业票据。这些代币由Coinbase和Franklin Templeton购买，并以**稳定币**结算。这是一笔短期企业债务交易，采用传统金融结构，但在公有区块链上发行、交易和结算，而不是通过传统的银行渠道。毫无疑问，这是一笔里程碑式的交易。但我的问题是，JP Morgan为什么要这样做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: In late 2025, JP Morgan served as an arranger for $50 million US commercial paper issuance on Salena's public blockchain. Galaxy Digital, which is a global cryptofocused financial services and infrastructure firm, issued the tokenized commercial papers. Those tokens were purchased by Coinbase and Franklin Templeton with settlement occurring in stablecoin. Now, this was a short-term corporate debt deal done in a traditional finance structure, but issued, traded, and settled directly on a public blockchain instead of through legacy banking rails. No doubt it was a landmark deal. But my question is why did JP Morgan do it?

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 我认为，我们真正需要理解的关键在于市场采用情况。关于在公有区块链上做事，有很多讨论。关于潜力，有很多讨论。关于需求，也有很多讨论。我认为，唯一能真正**压力测试**并**证明**这一点，并根据市场需求调整理论的方法，就是**做一些事情**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: I guess the key thing for us to really trying to understand what the market adoption is. There's a lot of talk about doing things on public blockchain. And there's a lot of talk about the potential. There's a lot of talk about the appetite. And I feel actually the only way that we can really pressure test that and prove it and adjust the thesis to kind of where the market needs to go is to do something.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 但Scott，既然您同时使用区块链和传统渠道进行交易，您是否已经选定了赢家，或者说首选的前进方向？在区块链领域，人们往往会很快地对使用哪种技术变得情绪化。要么是这个，要么是那个。你可以这样做，也可以那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: But Scott, now that you're using both blockchain and legacy rails for transactions, have you chosen a winner, a preferred way forward? quite often in in the in the blockchain space, it gets really emotional really quickly about what technology you use. It's either this or it's that. You can do it this way or you can do it that way. And

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 实际上，一个高效的市场会这样做，所以会有很多产品像今天一样运作，在美国拥有非常深厚和流动的资本市场基础。然后，我们会在这个市场中添加一些东西，无论是类似的产品还是在区块链上运行的新产品。在某个时刻，市场将决定区块链是否是更好的答案，你知道吗？它会成为一个完全区块链的解决方案，还是一个无区块链的解决方案，或者是一个常规技术与区块链结合的解决方案。老实说，这并不是我们JP Morgan的决定。我认为这是市场的决定。我的意思是，这就是我们正在进行的旅程。我认为，可以合理地说，有充分的理由表明区块链是许多不同市场工具的更好技术。目前还没有证据。所以，让我们建立这个证据体系，确保我们的理论是正确的，如果它在一个方面不太正确，它能否以另一种方式进行，并可能单独回答这个问题。所以，这确实是这次演习的重点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: really, a markets an an efficient market does and so there'll be a whole bunch of products that stay as they work today in a you very deep and liquid capital markets footprint in the United States. And there'll be some stuff that we add to that market, whether it be similar products or new products that work on blockchain. And at some point, the market will decide whether blockchain is a better answer or not, you know, and whether it becomes an all blockchain or a no blockchain or a regular technology and blockchain outcome. And to be honest, like that's not our decision as JP Morgan. I think that's the market's decision. I mean, that's that's the journey we're on. And I think it's reasonable to say that there's a good thesis to suggest that blockchain is a better technology for a bunch of different instruments in the market. There's no evidence yet. So, let's build that body of evidence and make sure that our thesis is correct and and if it if it's not quite correct in one way, can it go another way and perhaps answer the question separately. So, that that's really the point of this exercise.

</details>

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 如果我们从10,000英尺的高度来看，Scott，您将以飞行员的视角来看，传统市场渠道中流动的资金量远远超过链上流动的资金量。如果这个比例发生变化，那些巨额资本能否被代币化并在区块链上处理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: If we were to take a 10,000 foot view, and I'm going to ask you to take that pilot's view, if you will, Scott, um, the amount of money being moved in traditional market channels really dwarves what's moving on chain. If that ratio changes, could those massive amounts of capital be tokenized and handled on blockchain?

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 我认为我们需要弄清楚这些变化是为了什么目的。美国已经拥有全球最深厚、最流动的资本市场。要使其更有效率，您需要说，首先，有哪些低效率是我们认为可以解决的？其次，这些低效率如何以值得进行投资的方式积极影响市场？多年来，在各种代币化证券方面，已经进行了大量的供应和实验。但将更广泛的市场产品投入生产方面，并没有取得多少成功，因为一直缺乏广泛的可用现金来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: I I think we need to figure out like for what purpose those changes would happen. The United States already has the most deep and liquid capital markets on the planet. To make those more efficient, you need to kind of say, well, first of all, where are the inefficiencies that we think could be addressed? And second of all, how do those inefficiencies positively impact the market in a way that's worth making the investment to get there? There has been a lot of supply and experimentation with tokenized securities over a range of years. there hasn't been a lot of success in bringing sort of broader market products, you know, into production because there hasn't been a broad set of usable cash sources.

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 尽管稳定币正在增长，并且稳定币有机会继续增长，但仍然没有大量的可扩展现金来源。所以，明天，也许有现金，也许有稳定币，也许有代币化存款，也许在某些司法管辖区有央行数字货币，也许有其他结算交易的方式。所以，我认为问题真正在于，你如何将它们匹配起来？如果你有一个复杂的方法来选择特定平台上的证券，现在你有多种结算机制可供选择，那么这如何构建以及如何运作？同样，这很大程度上是一个客户驱动的对话。你知道，客户想做什么，他们想在哪里运营，我们认为我们能帮助他们吗？如果我们能帮助他们，那么我们的风险敞口是多少，我们准备承担什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: And when I as as much as stable coins are growing and the opportunity exists for stable coins to continue to grow, there still aren't an enormous set of scalable cash sources. And so tomorrow, maybe there's cash, maybe there's stable coins, maybe there's tokenized deposits, maybe there's central bank digital currencies in some jurisdictions, maybe there's other means of settling that transaction. And so I think that the question really is like how can you match those up? If you've got a sophisticated methodology of choosing the security on a particular platform and now you've got multiple choices of the settlement mechanism for that, like how does that then get built and how does that work? And again, that's very much a client-driven conversation. You know, it's what do the clients want to do, where they want to operate,

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 在那个领域。这与其他任何产品都一样。它是否在区块链上几乎不重要。我们每次都问自己同样的问题。我们如何支持客户？我们如何考虑我们的风险敞口？我们是否准备好在这个领域运营？我们将投入多少资源？我认为有很多东西可以学，我认为潜力是存在的，但你知道，我们仍然需要证明这个理论在市场上的可行性，然后你知道，看看现实将我们带向何方，我认为这个前景非常开放。

**Scott Lucas**: >> do we think we can help them with that? And if we can help them with that, like what's our risk footprint we're prepared to take >> in that sort of in that area. And that's the same as every other product. The fact it's on blockchain or not almost doesn't matter. Like we ask ourselves the same questions every time. How do we support clients? How do we think about our risk footprint? Are we prepared to operate in that space? what are the resources we're going to put against that? I think there is a fair bit to learn there and I think the potential exists but you know we we still need to prove the thesis in the market and then you know see where the reality takes us and I think that horizon's pretty open.

### 代币化的未来机遇

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: Scott，我们开头提到的商业票据交易是一个很好的概念验证。除了货币市场，您还看到了代币化在其他资产类别中带来哪些机会？

<details>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Scott, the commercial paper transaction we talked about off at the top that was a really great proof of concept in that specific domain. What other opportunities do you see tokenization bringing to other asset classes besides money markets?

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 如果您将某物放在一个分布式账本上，并有一个所有授权用户都能看到的单一记录，那么就不可能产生分歧，也不可能争论“你的就是我的，我的就是你的”。如果存在该工具的记录，那么您考虑和我们经常谈论的固定收益方面，也许您会认为票息，存在一个记录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: If you put something on a distributed ledger with a single record that entitled users can see, it's impossible to disagree and it's impossible to disagree that yours mine becomes ours. And if there's our record of that instrument, then the way that you think about and we often talk about this from a sort of a fixed income standpoint that maybe you think about coupon is there's one record.

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 那么，如果今天只有一个记录，我们每六个月或每年支付一次票息，因为管理这个过程和大规模核对这个过程需要大量的管理费用。嗯，如果只有一个记录，为什么不精确到毫秒计算票息呢？然后，当您交易该工具时，在那个特定时刻与交易相关的净价和毛价非常清晰。即使您稍后结算，这也是规则集。并且围绕其外观没有争议。您可以更改票息支付的频率。您可以按日、周、月支付。您可以提供关于您是否想以相同频率保留所有票息的选项，或者您是否想要不同的频率。这可以由投资者决定，如果他们想要不同的信用风险状况。这可以由发行人决定，如果他们想要不同的流动性状况。您可以嵌入一个智能合约来管理利率互换。因此，发行人就退出了方程式。现在，银行直接管理现金流向投资者或管理该互换的任何人。然后，您不需要一个非常复杂的金融部门来代表您管理互换，因为您没有所有相关的会计规则和处理流程等。

<details>

**Scott Lucas**: Well, if there's only one record today, we pay coupon on a six monthly or annual basis because there's a lot of overhead around managing that process and checking that process at scale. Well, if there's only one record, why wouldn't you calculate coupon to the millisecond? And then when you trade that instrument, that clean and dirty price associated with a trade at that particular moment is very very clear. Even if you settle it later, like that's the rule set. And there's no debate around what that looks like. You can change the frequency of the coupon payment. You could pay daily, weekly, monthly. You could provide optionality around um whether you wanted to keep all of the coupon at the same frequency or you wanted a different frequency. And that could be at the behest of the investor if they want a different credit risk profile. You could be at the behest of the issuer if they want a different liquidity profile. You could embed a smart contract in to manage the interest rate swap. So the issuer steps out of the equation.

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 如果是这种情况，那么不那么成熟、不那么大的公司等可能能够以今天无法获得的途径进入债务资本市场。所以，当你真正思考代币化能做什么时，它不仅仅是关于更快的动员和带来更多的抵押品。它还关于改变工具本身的潜力，使其能够提供更多的效用，并使资本市场能够做它们应该做的事情，即扩大和深化以服务更广泛的经济和经济增长。这就是重点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: And now you've got like the bank managing the cash flows directly to the investor or whoever is managing that that swap. And then you don't need a very sophisticated finance department who can manage the swap on your behalf because you don't have all the accounting rules and processing etc around those cash flows. Like if that's the case then companies that aren't as mature, aren't as big etc might be able to access debt capital markets in a way they can't access today. And so when you really think about like what tokenization can do, it's not just about faster mobilization and bringing more collateral to the table. It's also about like changing the potential for the instruments themselves in a way that enables more utility and enables capital markets to do what capital markets should do which is get themselves wider and deeper to service the wider economy and economic growth. Like that's the point.

### 时间线的争议与监管障碍

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: Rick Edelman说，代币化将彻底改变整个行业。他说，十年内一切都将被代币化并在链上交易。你同意吗？

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: We had a conversation with Rick Edelman. He said that tokenization will revolutionize the entire industry. He said that within 10 years everything will be tokenized and traded onchain. Do you agree?

</details>

**Scott Lucas**: 可能，但不太可能。这并不意味着它不应该发生。这不是关于它是否是正确选择的观点。但我认为这种改变不像大家想象的那么容易。技术准备、法律准备、监管理解，然后承担风险，然后升级内部系统，这之间有很大的差距。所以，这需要一些时间。而且，我不在乎是3年、5年、10年还是15年。我不在乎整个市场是否改变，或者部分市场是否改变。但我们确实相信，在将这项技术部署到市场的特定领域方面，具有绝对的价值。我们确实相信，随着时间的推移，将会有可扩展的市场变革。但是，要确定它需要多长时间，或者应该需要多长时间，我认为这不是我们的工作。我认为这是市场需要弄清楚的，我们希望与市场一起弄清楚这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Scott Lucas**: Possible but improbable. And that doesn't mean it shouldn't. It's not a view on whether it's the right choice or not. But I don't think this change is as easy as everyone thinks. There's a big difference between technological readiness, legal readiness, regulatory understanding, then taking risk, then upgrading internal systems. So that just takes a while. And and I don't care if it takes 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. I don't mind if the whole market changes or some of the market changes. But what we do believe in is there is absolute value in deploying this technology into specific areas of the market. We do believe that there will be scalable market change over time. But to be deterministic around um how long that takes or how long that should take, I I don't think that's our job. I think that's the market to figure that out and and we'll hopefully help figure that out with the market.

**主持人 (Angie Laauo)**: 今天我们的两位嘉宾都同意，代币化资产正作为一种强大的工具出现，为投资者和投资公司服务。但他们之间存在分歧的是时间线。Rick谈到代币化将在5到10年内占据主导地位，而Scott则关注客户需求，并让其决定采用的速度。所以，我想在结束本期节目时，回到Rick Edelman那里，听听他对加速机构采用并实现他那乐观预测需要什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Angie Laauo)**: Both our guests today agree that tokenized assets are emerging as a powerful tool for investors and investment companies. But where they differ is in the timeline. Rick talks about tokenization taking over within 5 to 10 years while Scott is monitoring client demand and letting that dictate the pace of adoption. So, I want to wrap this episode by going back to Rick Edelman to get his opinion of what it will take to accelerate the rate of institutional adoption and make his bullish prediction come true.

</details>

**Rick Edelman**: 阻碍采用的一个主要障碍是**国会缺乏明确性**。我们不知道规则是什么。我们不知道如何参与。我们没有托管规则。我们还不知道税收将是什么。所以，我们正在等待国会制定法律。一旦我们有了明确的规则，并且经纪行业、银行业、保险业都知道如何参与，您就会开始看到大规模的采用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rick Edelman**: A big impediment to adoption has been the lack of clarity by Congress. We don't know what the rules are. We don't know how to engage. We don't have rules for custody. We don't know what taxation is going to be yet. So, we're waiting for Congress to create the laws. Once we have the rules of the road and the brokerage industry, the banking industry, the insurance industry all know how they're allowed to engage, you'll begin to see the massive levels of adoption.
