### 市场收盘概览：震荡中收跌

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘直播。我们面临着各种新闻头条的来回冲击。大约20分钟后，Jason会加入我们进行“技术分析星期二”环节，届时他将从技术角度为我们带来所有最新动态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live and we have got a lot of different headlines that are going on back and forth. In about 20 minutes, we will have Jason on for the show and we will get into technical Tuesday and we'll get all of his updates on what's going on from a technical perspective.</p>
</details>

今天市场走势很有趣。坦白说，在最后大约20分钟之前，市场还基本是上涨的，但随后又开始转跌。**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）曾短暂翻绿，某些个股也确实上涨了。但现在，如你所见，标普500指数报661.32点，当天再次下跌。盘中最低点，至少在开盘期间，是655.86点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we had some interesting markets. We were going relatively green until honestly the last like 20 minutes and then we started going red again. I mean, we flipped green for a very quick second on the S&P 500. Certain names did go green. Uh, but now, as you can see, the S&P 500 right there, 661.32. We are back down for the day. The lowest we got to on the day, at least during the market open, was 655.86.</p>
</details>

所以，能看到市场有所喘息是件好事。盘中一度达到665点，但看起来我们最终还是会收跌。市场曾一度下跌1.5%，现在日内跌幅为1.63%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it is nice to see that you're getting a little bit of reprieve. At one point, we got to 665 on the day. Uh, but it looks like we are going to end out red. At one point, we were down 1.5%. Now, we are down 1.66 or 63% on the day.</p>
</details>

### 个人交易动态：小幅建仓三只股票

我今天进行了一些买入操作，打开了钱包。昨天我没有买任何东西，上周也买得很少。今天我买入了一些，对三四只股票进行了非常小规模的试探性建仓。它们是Nebius、亚马逊，以及下一个大家会又爱又恨的股票——老朋友BMR。我对这三只股票都只进行了非常小规模的买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did do some buying. I opened up the wallets, did some buying. Uh did not do any buying yesterday. Did very little buying last week. I did some buying. Very, very small nibbles on four names or three names. Uh Nebius, Amazon, and the next one that everyone's going to love or hate at the same time, good old BMR. Very, very small nibbles on these three.</p>
</details>

在它们小幅反弹后，你知道，这反弹可能是假的，可能是“死猫跳”（dead cat bounce）。我们会观察后续走势。但我等BMR已经等了一段时间了，坦白说，等了一个月。Nebius从97美元左右就开始等，直到它跌得更低。然后是亚马逊，它几乎回吐了财报后的全部涨幅。我曾在214、212美元买入亚马逊，之后它有过不错的上涨，一度达到255美元，但今天又全部跌回来了。这就是我小幅建仓的三只股票。如果聊天区里有谁买了什么，也请告诉我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But after they bounce just a little bit and you know maybe that bounce is fake. Maybe those are going to be dead cap bounces. We're going to see how that plays out. But uh have been waiting for a while on BMR. I mean quite frankly been waiting a month on that. Nebas been waiting since like 97 until it really got much lower than that. Uh and then Amazon kind of just gave back the entire freaking earnings move. I mean I was buying Amazon at 214 212 had a nice little jump and got to 255 and now it gave it all back today. Those are three of the names. Gave a little bit of a nibble on. Let me know if anyone bought anything in the chat.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头动态各异

有些股票出现了大幅反弹。Meta从583美元回升，我没有在583美元买入Meta，所以没能抓住那个底部，但现在股价是601美元。我们还要看583美元是否真的是底部，但回升到601美元是个不错的复苏。Meta今天确实有一些消息，美国一家法院裁定它不构成法律意义上的垄断。这对Meta来说是个好消息，但随后整个市场开始反弹，这本身对Meta也是有利的。SoFi股价在25美元以上，但仍受阻于27美元以下。谷歌股价在285美元，我们稍后会讨论关于Gemini的重磅更新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you had some names get a big rebound. Meta went from 583. I did not pick up Meta at 583, so I did not catch that bottom, but now that's at 601. We'll see if 583 ends up actually being the bottom, but 601, nice recovery. Meta did have some news today about uh them not being ruled in a legal monopoly from a US court. So, that was one of the good headlines for Meta, but then over overall the entire market started rebounding and that was good for Meta in of itself. SoFi above 25 but still stuck below 27. Google right there 285. We have some big updates on Gemini that we'll talk about.</p>
</details>

不幸的是，英伟达未能真正突破并翻绿，股价从179美元反弹后，现在是182美元，没有再触及179美元。我们稍后会更多地讨论英伟达和微软投资Anthropic的最新消息，因为这也是今天的另一个大新闻。微软股价在494美元，从486美元反弹。真不敢相信它居然跌到了486美元。哇，我都没注意到。现在494美元，当天仍下跌2.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia unfortunately could not really break through back into the green bounced from 179 has not really touched 179 now at 182. Uh we'll talk more about the updates with Nvidia and Microsoft investing in Anthropic because that was another big headline today. And then Microsoft right there 494. That one bounced off 486. Can't believe it even went to 486. Wow, I did not see that. 494 still down 2.5% on the day.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济数据与市场情绪

这就是整个市场的现状。看起来我们不会以绿色收盘，但也没有早上那么惨烈。这又回到了市场震荡的观点上。市场正在等待英伟达财报带来一些确定性。我们确实收到了一些政府数据的更新。我们将在大约五天后得到**PPI**（Producer Price Index: 生产者价格指数，衡量国内生产者在生产过程中所需采购品的物价状况）数据。本来预计是明天公布，但现在显示我们将在11月25日得到它，所以实际上比五天要长一点，大约一周后。然后，9月份的美国进出口价格指数将在12月3日发布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that is what we've got across the board in this market. Again, it doesn't look like we're going to end out green, but it's not the complete bloodbath that it was in the morning. And that goes back to this idea of the choppiness of the markets. The market's waiting for a little bit of uh security from Nvidia earnings. We do have some government data that we got an update from. We are going to be getting PPI uh in about five days. So, we were supposed to get it tomorrow, but uh it now says we are getting it um let me pull this up in a second on November 25th. So, actually a little bit longer than five days in about a week. And then US import and export price indices for September will be released December 3rd. So, PPI for September, November 25th, US import export price indices on uh December 3rd for September.</p>
</details>

所以我们将得到更多数据。我们昨晚确实得到了非常重要的初请失业金人数，有23.2万人申请失业救济。如你所见，美联储的（降息）概率回到了51%以上，这至少比昨天的41%要好。所以我认为，这一点加上AI交易领域的一点平静，开始让市场有所回暖。但我们绝没有脱离险境。只是看起来情况可能不像清晨时那么糟糕了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we are going to get a lot more data. We did get that jobless claims last night which was super important. 232,000 jobs um that filed for unemployment or people that filed for unemployment. As you can see, the Fed probabilities are back above 51% which means at least it's better than where it was yesterday at 41. So, I think that along with a little bit of calmness around the AI trade started getting the market to warm up a little bit, but in no way or shape are we out of the woods. It just seems like maybe it's not as absolutely horrible as it was early in the morning.</p>
</details>

### 谷歌Gemini 3惊艳亮相

我今天没有买谷歌，但天哪，Sundar Pichai简直让我想在历史高点买入谷歌。Gemini 3绝对令人难以置信。有很多值得看的东西，但这是他们从Google AI Studio发布的视频，它几乎获得了全方位的一致好评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't buy Google today, but goodness, Sundar is making me want to buy Google at basically all-time highs. Gemini 3 is absolutely incredible. There's a lot of things to look at, but here is their release video from Google AI Studio, and it's pretty much getting universal praise across the board.</p>
</details>

（视频内容描述）在AI Studio中使用Gemini 3进行“Bite coding”，你可以构建任何东西。构建全新的体验。创建能“看见”的应用。制造能“倾听”的工具。用一个提示就能构建应用。获取灵感，不断优化，再优化。立即分享给朋友，并进行再创作。然后与全世界分享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bite coding in AI Studio with Gemini 3 lets you build anything. Build entirely new experiences. Create apps that see. Make tools that listen. Build apps with a single prompt. [music] Get inspired. >> [music] >> Refine [music] >> and refine some more [music] >> right now. >> Share with a friend [music] >> and remix. >> Then share with the world. >> [music]</p>
</details>

他们展示的一些东西真是太不可思议了。我没有看完所有的例子，但我今天看到的一些简直疯狂。比如，有个人说：“我让Gemini 3 Pro一次性创建一个3D乐高编辑器。它搞定了用户界面、复杂的空间逻辑和所有功能。”今天还有很多其他的例子被上传。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's pretty incredible some of the things that they're showing off. I mean, I didn't get through all the examples, but some of the ones I saw today are just kind of crazy. I mean, this person right here said, "I asked Gemini 3 Pro to create a 3D Lego editor in one shot. Enailed the UI, complex spatial logic, and all the functionality." And there's a lot of more examples that were uploaded today.</p>
</details>

那么，除了对谷歌极度看好以及Sundar因推出Gemini 3而应得的赞誉之外，我们能从中得到什么启示呢？我认为是：人工智能是真实存在的。你在屏幕上看到的这一切，只有通过人工智能才可能实现。所以，这或许是对整个市场的一个提醒：人工智能是一个非常真实的东西，它不是一时的风尚，也不是虚假的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so what is the takeaway from this outside of like unbelievably bullish Google and just like the the praise that Sundar deserves for uh getting Gemini 3 out there? I think it's AI is real. [laughter] Like what you're seeing on the screen is only possible because of AI. So maybe a little bit of a reminder to the entire market that AI is a very real thing. It's not a fad or it's not fake.</p>
</details>

你需要大量的数据中心计算能力、GPU等等，还有**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路）。Gemini 3就是用大量的谷歌TPU训练出来的，才得以实现。这是它的基准测试数据，Gemini 3 Pro几乎击败了所有对手。就连埃隆·马斯克都不得不评论说，他对Gemini 3所取得的成功感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that you need a lot of data center compute, GPUs, etc. TPUs. Gemini 3 was trained on a lot of Google TPUs to be able to make this thing a reality. These are the benchmarks right here. Gemini 3 pros beating pretty much everything. I mean, even Elon had to uh comment and say how surprised he was by the level of success that Gemini 3 is uh is deploying.</p>
</details>

所有这一切都来自于一个整合的生态系统：数据中心、计算能力、GPU、以及让所有这些数据中心正常运行所需的电力、云计算等等。这些东西都是相辅相成的，这就是为什么我们看到整个行业开始成为一个巨大的投资机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, all of that comes through this integrated ecosystem of the data centers, the compute, the GPUs, the power that's necessary for all of those data centers to make sense. the cloud computing like this stuff all goes t in in tandem with each other which is why we've seen this entire industry start becoming a massive investing opportunity.</p>
</details>

### 沙特万亿美元投资计划瞄准美国AI

另一个明白这件事有多重大的就是沙特人。美国政府正计划批准向沙特的人工智能企业Humane出售芯片。Humane是沙特公共投资基金的子公司，拥有大量资金可以投资于所有这些芯片公司并建设更多数据中心。记住，英伟达的业绩指引不包括中国和中东。所以如果这次销售获批，可能会带来意外的利好。我们可能不会获得对华销售的批准，但如果芯片公司如英伟达和AMD获准向中东销售，那显然是利好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the other person that understands how big of a deal it is are the Saudis US government is planning to approve the sale of chips to the Saudi AI venture Humane Humane is a subsidiary of the public investment fund in Saudi Arabia that has lots of money to be able to invest in all of these chipbased companies and build out more data centers remember Nvidia's guidance does not include include China and it does not include the Middle East. So that could be the upside surprise if this does get approved. We're probably not going to get approved for China. But if we do get approved in terms of the chip companies with Nvidia and AMD for the Middle East, then obviously that would be bullish.</p>
</details>

这是沙特王子今天所说的：“我们正考虑将对美国的投资从6000亿美元增加到1万亿美元。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what the Saudi prince said today. We're thinking of increasing [snorts] our investment from 600 billion to 1 trillion in the United States.</p>
</details>

（视频片段）沙特王子：“今天是我们历史上非常重要的时刻，因为我们未来还有很多工作要做。我们相信美国的未来，我们相信总统先生您正在做的事情，这确实为创造更多经济增长和商业机会奠定了良好的基础，也为世界和平做出了贡献。我相信，总统先生，在今天和明天，我们将宣布把6000亿美元的投资增加到近1万亿美元，这是在许多领域的真实投资和真实机会，我们今天签署的协议涵盖了技术、人工智能、材料、磁铁等多个领域，这将创造大量的投资机会。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Today it's very important uh uh time in our history because there's also a lot of things that we're working in in the future. uh we believe uh in the future of West of America, we believe in what you're doing, Mr. President, it's really creating a lot of good things and good foundation to create more economic growth, more business in America and also your work for the world uh uh peace. I believe Mr. present in the today and tomorrow we're going to announce that we are going to increase that that 600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment real investment and real opportunity by details in many areas and the agreement that we are signing today in many areas in technology in AI in uh materials magnets uh etc that will create a lot of investment opportunities</p>
</details>

特朗普：“所以你现在是说，6000亿会变成1万亿？”
沙特王子：“当然，因为我们正在签署的协议会促成这一点。”
特朗普：“我喜欢这个。”
沙特王子：“不，这很棒。我很感激。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so you are doing that now you're saying to me now that the 600 million will be one trillion >> definitely because what we are signing facilitate that. >> I like that. >> No, that's great. That's I appreciate that.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，你知道特朗普刚才拍了拍他的膝盖吗？在沙特阿拉伯，如果你触摸王子，你可能会被判长期监禁。所以，你其实是不应该碰王子的，但我想如果你是总统，那就没关系了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> By the way, you know how Trump just slapped him on the knee? In Saudi Arabia, if you touch the prince, you can go to jail for a long time. So, uh, yeah, you're you're not really supposed to touch the prince, but I guess if you're the president, that's okay.</p>
</details>

特朗普：“太棒了。我们正在创造前所未有的数字。坦白说，如果你看不到美国的潜力，你也不会这么做。你不想亏钱。”
沙特王子：“正如总统先生所说，这是地球上最热门的国家。但您所创造的不仅仅是今天的机会，也是美国长期的机会，这将在未来几十年对美国经济产生积极影响，为新兴技术奠定正确的基础，这对美国来说是积极的游戏规则改变者。我们希望成为其中的一部分。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Great. It's No, we're doing numbers that nobody's ever done. And in all fairness, if you didn't see potential in the US, you wouldn't be doing that. You don't want to lose money. >> As you said, Mr. President, it's the most hottest country in the the planet. But what you're creating is not about opportunity today. It's about also long-term opportunity in America that will affect American economy positively in the next coming decades, preparing the right foundation of emerging technologies that that's a game changer for America in a good way. And we want to be part of it.</p>
</details>

### AI投资热潮背后的逻辑

从根本上说，这1万亿美元的投资对美国有好处吗？显然是。对人工智能行业有好处吗？是的。但从这个新闻和谷歌Gemini 3的新闻中，我们能得到什么启示呢？谷歌Gemini 3的故事告诉我们，模型正变得越来越好，它们正在融入我们生活的方方面面，我们再也回不到没有人工智能的世界了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, at its core, is the $1 trillion investment good for the United States? Obviously, is it good for the AI sector? Yes. But what is the takeaway from that story and the Google story? The Google Gemini 3 story is like, oh my goodness, there are models that are becoming better and better and better. They are getting integrated through every part of our life and we're not going to go back to a world where there's not AI.</p>
</details>

而从沙特王子的讲话中得到的启示是，他们明白，至少在沙特阿拉伯的背景下，他们不能在未来10年仅仅依赖石油收入。王子一直非常直言不讳地表示，他认为沙特阿拉伯以前的领导层过于专注于石油这种不可避免会消亡的东西，他们必须为2050年的生活做好准备，而不是2025年，而这需要大量的投资。因此，所有这些投资的资金，显然会流入像美光、AMD、英伟达这样的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The takeaway from uh um the Saudi prince is that they understand in terms of at least in the context of Saudi Arabia that they cannot rely on oil money for the next 10 years. and the prince has been very vocal about the idea that he thinks that previous leadership in Saudi Arabia was way too focused on something that is inevitably going to die out in terms of oil and they have to get ready for life in 2050 versus life in 2025 and that requires massive amounts of investment and so as a result of all that investment obviously that money is going to come into the microns of the world the AMDs of the world the Nvidas of the world.</p>
</details>

### 市场回调：情绪转变还是结构性转变？

问题在于，市场能否克服这个小插曲，即他们所感受到的市场情绪转变。现在，这要么是情绪转变，这对我们所有人来说是最好的情况，因为情绪可能会转向积极的一面；要么是结构性转变。如果是结构性转变，那么显然还会有更多的下跌空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the question becomes can the market move past this hiccup of navigating what they're feeling is a sentiment shift in the market. Now, either it's a sentiment shift, which is the best case scenario for all of us because sentiment will potentially shift to the positive side, or it's a structural shift. And if it is a structural shift, then obviously there's more downsides to come.</p>
</details>

我个人不认为这是结构性转变。我认为我们每天看到的所有证据都表明，这更像是情绪问题，而不是结构性转变，除非我们陷入衰退，那是另一个问题。但如果不是，那么这更多是每个人都必须应对的情绪问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I personally don't believe it's a structural shift. I think all the evidence we see every single day is less about it being a structural shift unless we get into a recession, which is another question. But if it's not, then this is more sentiment that everyone kind of has to navigate with.</p>
</details>

### 当前回调的健康性分析

我今天也在思考这个问题。回想一下，八月份我们本以为会崩盘，结果却走高了。九月份我们本以为会崩盘，结果也走高了。十月份，虽然本应是下跌的月份，我们经历了一些震荡，但最终当月还是上涨了2.5%。所以，十一月份我们现在下跌了4%。我知道我们很多人跌得不止4%，但至少标普500指数下跌了4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, you know, I was kind of thinking about it today. Uh when you when you really look at it, August, we were supposed to crash, but we went higher. September, we were supposed to crash, but we went higher. October, although uh it's supposed to be an October month, we ended up having some choppiness, but we still ended 2.5% up for the month. So, November, we're now down 4%. I know a lot of us are down more than 4%, but at least on the S&P 500, it's down 4%.</p>
</details>

从根本上说，这次回调感觉是健康的——我讨厌这么说，大家也都会讨厌我这么说。我知道没人想听这个，但我们已经连续六个月上涨了。十一月份出现4%的回调，对我来说，这并不意味着这是一个现在必须破裂的泡沫。我知道空头们正在尖叫这个观点，但连续六个月上涨后下跌4%，为此生气有意义吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At its core, it feels like this pullback, and I hate to say this, and everyone's going to hate me saying this, is healthy. And I know no one wants to hear that, but we were green six months in a row. The idea that we're taking a 4% pullback in November, I mean, that's just not something that to me means that it's a a bubble that now has to has to pop. And I know that's what the bears are sort of like screaming, but does that make sense to be mad that we're down 4% after having six months in a row of green?</p>
</details>

人们在说为2022年做好准备，当时一切都崩溃了，纳斯达克指数下跌了40%。即使我们再下跌10%，也就是从现在的位置再跌6%，那将使标普500指数达到6200点左右。我想很多人会同意这一点，即使他们不愿承认：在11月底标普500指数达到6200点，对整个市场来说，远比一飞冲天到7200点要健康得多。这意味着很多股票可能还有更多下跌空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, people are saying get ready for 2022. Where everything collapses, the NASDAQ goes down 40%. Even if we get a 10% move, so another 6% down from here, that puts us at 6,200, I think. And I think a lot of people would agree with this, even if they would hate to admit it. It is way healthier to be 6,200 at the end of November on the S&P uh for the overall market, which means a lot of stocks probably have a lot more down to go than to moonshot up to 7,200.</p>
</details>

我知道，如果周二（11月18日）标普指数能达到7200点，那会很有趣，但那是不真实的，对吧？它不会基于任何逻辑，只会是大量的狂热和炒作。你无法将系统中的泡沫或过度杠杆清除出去，而这些显然已经开始离开系统，尤其是在加密货币市场和许多没有盈利的股票中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know it would be really fun to be like Tuesday, November 18th, 7200, boom, S&P above 7. But it wouldn't be real, right? Like it wouldn't be uh based on any logic. It would just be a lot of euphoria, just be a lot of hype. you wouldn't get any of the froth or excess leverage out of the system which has obviously started to leave the system especially in the crypto markets especially in a lot of stocks that don't have any earnings.</p>
</details>

所以，尽管经历这个过程很痛苦，但如果这不是牛市概念的结构性衰退——我不同意这种假设，但它确实有可能——那么它就不是世界末日。相反，这是我们都必须应对的事情。坦白说，我认为这个想法并不疯狂。如果我们当时在7300、7400点，那简直是在乞求一场史诗般的崩溃。而现在，嘿，我们别太疯狂。我们曾非常接近高点，达到了6890点，离新高不到1%。现在喘口气，也许需要喘更久一点，让估值倍数压缩，让市场消化已经发生的许多财报。然后，如果财报能够证明，我们就可以为下一轮上涨做好准备。尽管这很糟糕，但我不认为想象这种情况会发生是疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so as much as it sucks to go through and it obviously is painfilled it's not the end all beall if it is not a structural decline in the concept of the bull market which you know it could be I just disagree with that assumption but it's rather something that we all have to deal with and I think that's not the craziest idea I mean quite frankly again if we were at 73 7400 like that's just begging for an epic collapse apps versus, hey, let's not get crazy. I mean, we get we got pretty close. We got to 68 66 6,890. You know, we were less than 1% away. Took a bit of a breather. Maybe we have to take more of a breather, allowing valuation multiples to compress, allowing the market to digest a lot of the earnings that have happened. And then we can get ready for the next leg up if the earnings can justify that, which, you know, as much as this sucks, I don't think it's crazy to imagine that would take the case.</p>
</details>

标普500指数到6200点意味着没有增长。是的，很难想象我们会到那里，但如果我们真的到了，我认为很多股票会看起来非常有吸引力，因为那将抹去今年大部分的涨幅。到那时，你必须问自己，好吧，为什么这些股票应该在这个价位？如果它们不应该，那我认为市场会关心这些机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">62 S&P 500 means no growth. Yeah, it would be hard to imagine we get there, but if we do, I just think a lot of stocks would look very attractive because that would be eliminating the majority of the year's gains. And again, at that point, you got to ask yourself, all right, well, why do these stocks deserve to be here? And if they don't deserve to be here, those would be opportunities I think the market cares about.</p>

### 当日收盘及重要新闻回顾

美东时间11月18日星期二下午4点，感谢大家的到来。股市现已收盘。今天绝对还是一个下跌日，标普指数收于660.17点，下跌约0.82%，接近1%。BMR表现尚可，当天上涨4.5%。Nebius上涨5.3%，一度达到92.50美元。亚马逊最高涨至227美元，收于222美元，跌幅4%。微软也遭到了大幅评级下调，这也让华尔街有些不安。股价跌至486美元，现报493美元，下跌2.7%。

<p class="english-text">Tuesday, November 18th, 4 p.m. Thank you everybody for being here. The stock market is now closed. [music] All right, we are done for the day. Definitely still a red day. 660.17 on the S&P, which means we were down about 82% almost 1%. BMR actually held up a bit, up 4 and a.5% on the day. Nebas 5.3. Nebas got to 9250 at one point. Amazon got all the way up to 227, closed at 222, took off 4% on Amazon. Microsoft got a big downgrade as well. That also got the street a little upset. Fell to 486, now at 493, down 2.7%.</p>
</details>

今天另一则重要新闻是，Anthropic将获得微软和英伟达总计高达约150亿美元的投资。根据今天的公告，Anthropic将从Azure购买300亿美元的计算资源。这引发了关于循环投资的疑问。我们稍后会详细讨论，但这也是今天一个非常重大的公告。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The other big news of the day for those that missed it is Anthropic is getting an investment from Microsoft and Nvidia of up to about $15 billion collectively. And Anthropic is going to be buying 30 billion of compute from Azure uh as of today's announcement. And that brings up questions of the circular stuff. We'll talk more about that in a bit, but that was also a very big announcement today.</p>
</details>

坦白说，我认为这个公告之所以发布，是因为谷歌的Gemini 3.0问世了。微软、Anthropic和英伟达想确保人们明白，英伟达的GPU仍然很重要，而不仅仅是谷歌的TPU。Anthropic也希望为自己的模型争取大量宣传，而不仅仅是Gemini。所以我认为，在Gemini 3.0的背景下，这个公告的时机是合理的。这是所有模型公司之间的健康竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and quite frankly I think that announcement came out because Google's Gemini 3.0 came out and you know Microsoft Anthropic Nvidia kind of wanted to make sure that people understood that uh GPUs are still important from Nvidia not just Google's TPUs and Anthropic you know wanted to give a lot of publicity to their model not just on Gemini. So I think it made sense the timing of this announcement in the context of Gemini 3.0. It's healthy competition across all the model companies.</p>

### 白宫考虑发放2000美元“红利”

除了谷歌Gemini和Anthropic的新闻，还有一条新闻在今天所有AI消息的映衬下有些被忽视，但这是真实的事情。据彭博社报道，白宫副幕僚长表示，政府正在考虑在未经国会批准的情况下，利用关税收入向数百万美国人发放2000美元的“红利”支付。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, another big headline, so outside of the Google Gemini news and the anthropic stuff, you have this headline which kind of went under the radar, uh, given all the other AI stuff we had today, but I mean it's a real things, folks. Deputy White House chief of staff said the administration is considering options to send millions of Americans $2,000 dividend payments funded by tariff revenues without congressional approval, according to to Bloomberg.</p>
</details>

我不知道他们打算怎么做，但他们似乎正在尝试。他们试图在未经国会批准的情况下这样做，而国会掌握着钱袋子。我不知道他们到底要怎么操作，但他们在努力。所以，看起来这些刺激性支票，我不知道是否会发放，但白宫肯定在想办法让它们发出去。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I don't know how they're going to do it, but I guess they're going to do it. And the fact that they're looking to do it without congressional approval, again, Congress has the power of the purse. I don't know how the heck they're going to do that, but they're trying to. And so, it looks like these STEMI checks, I mean, I don't know if they're coming, but the White House is definitely thinking that they're going to find a way to get them to get out there.</p>

### 专家激辩：AI是泡沫还是未来？

Aswath Damodaran最近在CNBC上发表了看法。让我们听听他说了什么，我很好奇大家对他的分析有何看法。他在周末做了一个很长的播客，引发了很多不同的观点，基本论点是我们正正式处于一个泡沫之中。现在他在这里确认了这一论点，并解释了他认为我们处于泡沫中的逻辑。Jason应该在5到10分钟后上线，然后我们将进入技术分析星期二环节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Aswave, he was on CNBC. Let's listen to what he had to say. curious about what people's thoughts are for his analysis. Again, he did a big podcast over the weekend, got a lot of different views, basically saying we are officially in a bubble. Here he is confirming that argument and explaining his logic for why he thinks we're in a bubble. Jason should be on in about 5 to 10 minutes and then we will get into technical Tuesday.</p>
</details>

Aswath Damodaran：“你怎么知道我们被高估了？人们很容易说这是个泡沫，但基于什么呢？基于人们在投资上砸钱，却没有真正告诉我这些投资的回报将从何而来。从Sam Altman开始，当被问及OpenAI如何盈利时，他回避了这个问题，没有给我一个关于OpenAI的商业逻辑。我看到的是像甲骨文、Meta、微软、OpenAI这样的公司，投入巨额资金建设AI基础设施，却没有提供任何切实的……我甚至不想要证据，至少给我一个故事，说明所有这些投资将如何通过产品和服务变现。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But how do you know we're we're overvalued? It's easy for people to say yes, this is a bubble based on what? based on the fact that people are throwing money at investing without really telling me where the money is going to come back from those investments. Starting with, you know, Sam Alman, he's asked about how does open AI expect to make money blowing off that answer without giving me a business sense of open AI. What I get are companies like Oracle, like Meta, like Microsoft, like OpenAI throwing insane amounts of money to building AI architecture without providing any tangible. I mean, I don't even want evidence. At least give me a story of how all this investment is going to play off in terms of products and services on which he can make money.</p>
</details>

我对此的快速回应是，我不是说Sam Altman的回答是最好的，我知道在这些公司如何盈利方面存在很多困惑。但是说完全不了解商业模式，不知道他们将如何创造收入……如果你听了OpenAI的CFO在《华尔街日报》会议上的讲话，我听了她一周前40分钟的整个主题演讲。她介绍了很多不同的商业模式，不仅仅是消费者订阅和广告。我知道Sam Altman的回答不是最好的，但用那个回答来说，“他们不可能建立起大生意，所以一切都是假的”，我不知道，这感觉有点偏颇，基于他们拥有的所有不同可能性。他们仍然可能失败，但我不知道他的回答是否是OpenAI完蛋的头号原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so you my quick response to that is I'm not saying Sam Alman had the best answer and I know there's a lot of confusion over how these companies are going to monetize, but to say that there is absolutely no understanding of the business model, how they're going to generate revenue. I mean, if you listen to the opening eye CFO at the Wall Street Journal conference, I listened to the entire 40-minute keynote she gave a week ago. I mean, she introduced a lot of different business models outside of just consumer subscription and advertising. I know Sam Alman did not have the best response there. But to use that response and say, "Well, there is no way in hell they're going to be able to build a big business off of this. Therefore, everything is fake." I don't know. It just feels a little a little misguided based on all the different things that they have. They could still fail, but I don't know if his answer is the number one reason for why OpenAI is done.</p>
</details>

CNBC主持人：“我同意今天对亚马逊和微软的评级下调，至少在其叙述中是这样，即‘我们不能再相信你了，你现在必须向我证明’。我们给了你怀疑的利益，推高了你的股价，现在是时候了，我们需要一些关于所有这些钱去向的切实答案。但如果我们一时半会得不到这些答案呢？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">agree with that that downgrade today of Amazon and Microsoft at least in the narration around it which is don't you can't we can't do the trust us anymore. You got to show me now. We we gave you the benefit of the doubt. We drove your stock prices up and now it's like okay we need some tangible answers on where all this money is going. But what if we can't get those for a while? We may be faced with months if not years before we know</p>
</details>

Aswath Damodaran：“这就是从高估到决定做空的桥梁对我来说太遥远的原因。显然，AI被高估了，但你问我它是否被高价了？那是另一个问题。那关乎催化剂和修正。你说得对，清算的时刻可能需要几天、几周甚至几个月。记住，艾伦·格林斯潘在1996年11月就警告过‘非理性繁荣’，而修正直到2000年才发生。所以你可能要为那个催化剂和修正等很长时间。因此，即使我们可能接受AI被高估了，我也不确定作为投资者，你立即的后续行动会是什么，除了不要把你所有的钱都投入这些AI股票，因为那是在自找麻烦。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and that's the reason going from overvaluation to deciding to sell short is a bridge that's too far for me. Clearly AI is overvalued but you ask me is it overpriced? That's a different question. That's about catalyst and corrections. And you're right that that moment of reckoning might take days it might take weeks it might take months. I mean remember Alan Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance in November of 1996. The correction itself did not happen till 2000. So you could be waiting a long time for that catalyst and correction. So even though we might accept that that AI is overvalued, I'm not sure what the immediate followup is going to be for you as an investor other than not to pour in all of your money into these AI stocks because that's asking for trouble.</p>
</details>

CNBC主持人：“当我看你的笔记时，我觉得很有趣，你认为英伟达会超预期，对吧？我想每个人都同意他们会超预期，但股价很可能会下跌。你为什么这么认为？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I think it's interesting when I look at your notes to our producers that you you think Nvidia is going to beat, right? I mean, I think everybody agrees that they're they're going to beat, but that the stock price is likely to go down. Why do you think that?</p>
</details>

Aswath Damodaran：“因为我认为市场期望你……预期游戏是个奇怪的东西。如果你每个季度都比分析师的预期高出15%，而这次你只高出10%，对市场来说，这就是一个负面意外。我认为，随着这些公司越来越擅长超越分析师的数字预测，市场正在将这一点计入他们的预期中。我实际上认为，存在着我们观察不到的第二套预期，而这才是驱动市场的因素。所以我的预测是，他们会超越分析师的预期，但不会超越市场的预期。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because I think markets expect you to I mean, the expectations game is a strange one. If you keep beating analyst expectations by 15% every quarter and you beat them by only 10% per market, that's a negative surprise. And I think increasingly as these companies have become better and better at beating the analyst forecast of numbers, markets are building that in to their expectations. I'm actually arguing that this is a second set of expectations out there that we don't observe, which is what's driving the market. So that would be my prediction. They'll beat analyst expectations, but they won't beat market expectations.</p>
</details>

CNBC主持人：“在这个群体中，无论是英伟达还是其他公司，你认为哪只股票最引人关注或最需要谨慎？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a stock in the group whether it's Nvidia or another that that garners the most attention or the most caution do you think?</p>
</details>

Aswath Damodaran：“我认为一家公司花的钱越多，就越需要谨慎。所以我会看这些公司中每一家的AI支出，除了英伟达。他们的支出越多，我就越谨慎。这也是为什么，如果你打算买七巨头中的一只，现在不是买任何一只的好时机。我会说买苹果，因为它是这些公司中最谨慎的，而现在，谨慎可能是决定哪些公司能以最小损失走出困境的关键词。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think the more a company spends the more caution is called for. So I would just take the AI spending of each of these companies. Now outside of Nvidia and the more spending they have the more cautious I get which is one reason it might if you're if you're planning to buy one of the bank seven stocks it's not a great time to buy any of them. I would say by Apple because it's the most cautious of these companies and this is a time where caution might actually be the by word for which of these companies will walk out of these with the least damage.</p>
</details>

苹果的市盈率是40倍，增长速度不如其他公司快。其他公司的估值倍数更低，增长更快。但他对**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司为获取或升级实物资产（如设备、财产、工业建筑）所花费的资金）如此不满，以至于他的论点是转而购买苹果。这显示了华尔街一部分人与其他部分人之间思维的巨大分歧，后者觉得这种资本支出不现实，毫无意义，没有足够的理由，以至于你宁愿买一个比Meta、亚马逊或谷歌贵得多且增长慢得多的公司，仅仅因为他们没有在资本支出上花那么多钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apple's trading at 40 times earnings and not really growing as fast as the other companies. The other companies are trading at cheaper multiples and growing faster. But he is so mad about the capex spend that his argument is buy Apple instead. And that goes to show the kind of divergence in thinking between some parts of the street and other parts that just feel this capex is unrealistic. It makes no sense. It is not justified enough to the point that you'd buy a company that is way more expensive than Meta, Amazon or Google and it's not growing as fast just because they're not spending that much on capex.</p>
</details>

CNBC主持人：“我们看到的超大规模云服务商的债务融资和所谓的循环交易，你对这些怎么看？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's so funny. Um, you know, this this company was so criticized, we've mentioned this several times over the last week for being behind and not going all in like the others. And now we've had this market upset and all this volatility and we're like, well, Apple looks great compared to the others who aren't spending as much. Let me let me finish with this this last question. The debt raises that we've seen among the hyperscalers and these so-called circular deals. What do you make of all that?</p>
</details>

Aswath Damodaran：“我先说循环交易。对我来说，这是他们担心的迹象。他们担心如果出现颠覆，整个AI基础设施可能会面临风险。我想起一年前的DeepSeek，它通过说‘也许你不需要这些芯片和巨大的数据中心’来改变了AI的故事。我看到的是，他们正在预先布局，通过使自己成为现状来防止这种情况发生。所以对我来说，这是恐惧的迹象，而不是对未来的乐观或信心的迹象。至于信贷，到目前为止，如果你看信贷占大型科技公司现金流的百分比，对我来说并不麻烦。我不认为催化剂会来自那里。但我认为，那些使用信贷的小型AI公司正在将自己置于风险之中。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'll take the circular deals first. To me, it's a sign that they're worried. They're worried that the entire AI in the infrastructure could be put at risk if there's a disruption. I think of deepseek a year ago where essentially you change the AI story by saying maybe you don't need these chips and these huge data centers and what I see is this preemptive setting up to prevent that from happening by making themselves the status quo. So to me it's a sign of fear not a sign of optimism or confidence about the future. The credit so far if you look at the credit as a percentage of cash flows of the big tech companies throw off it's not to me troublesome. That's not where I think the catalyst would come from. But I think the smaller AI companies that are using credit are putting themselves at risk.</p>

### 技术星期二：市场技术面分析

#### Jason：区分交易与投资

Amit：让我们进入技术星期二环节。

Jason：这个环节是关于交易的。所以，如果你非常倾向于投资，首先，我不想吓到任何投资者，我认为任何投资者都不应该对此感到害怕。其次，我认为今天的市场有很多猫腻，人们……我看着我在X上的信息流，各种垃圾信息满天飞，你知道，一切都要烧毁了，等等。首先，这就像噪音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: this is about trading. And so, if you're uh if you're if you're very much into investing, first of all, I don't want to scare any investors, and I don't think any investors should be scared about this. Num number one, I think there's a lot of shenanigans out there in the markets today and people are I I look at the feed that I get on X and I'm like I see all kinds of crap flying around all the you know [laughter] things are fl like you know it's it's all going to burn blah blah blah right now. And I mean first of all it's it's it's like noise.</p>
</details>

我看图表，我必须说实话。我首先想问，我们到底在谈论哪个指数级别的回调？因为我们离高点还很近，这是第一点。在指数层面上，回调并不大。但话虽如此，很多人的高飞股和高增长股，包括我的Robinhood或Palantir，都受到了相当大的打击。但这是这类股票的常态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and I'm like this pullback this pullback. I look at the charts and I I got I got to be honest. I'm like, first of all, what what what what the hell what pullback o on at the [laughter] index level are we talking about? Because like we're still really close to the highs number one. Um and and it really hasn't been that much of a pullback at the at at the index level. But that said, you know, a lot of people's highf flyers and and heavy growth stocks, my hoodie included, or Palunteers included, have been hit pretty hard. But that's that kind of comes with the territory. So, um I mean</p>
</details>

Amit：这也是一个很好的免责声明。如果Jason说了一个股票的价格水平，记住他是在谈论交易。如果你打算长期持有亚马逊10年，而Jason认为亚马逊可能会触及210美元，请不要惊慌失措，因为他只是对亚马逊短期看跌。归根结底，这是交易，很多是短期的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: also it's it's a good disclaimer. If Jason says a price level in a stock, remember he's talking about if you're long Amazon for the next 10 years and Jason thinks Amazon might touch 210. Please do not run for the hills and get scared and want to kill Jason because he's he's a little bearish on Amazon because at the end of day this is trading and a lot of this is shortterm.</p>
</details>

Jason：说句公道话，我今天其实买了一些亚马逊的股票。在所有股票中，我刚听了你放的那段视频，那个人在谈论……我买的量很小，甚至算不上一笔象征性的投资。但当我们谈论投资时，它与交易完全不同，对吧？我认为必须在这个环节前说明，交易和投资在时间框架上并不兼容。因为你的时间跨度，或者说你期望资金在市场中活跃运作的时间，是完全不同的。所以，从投资的角度来看，这实际上应该令人兴奋。因为你可能会遇到一些“黑色星期五”的折扣，但也可能不会。我只是想从这个角度做好准备。而从交易的角度来看，情况可能会有些不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Well, to be honest, well, to be fair, I actually bought some Amazon stock today. Wow. of all of them, I just heard the clip that you had this guy talking about and I mean it's a small like not even like a token piece, but when we're talking about investing, it's completely different than trading, right? And I think that that you have to preface this segment with that trading and investing are not really compatible from a time frame perspective, right? because your time horizon or how long you you you expect to have money actively moving in the market that that that time horizon is completely different. So, uh from an investment perspective, it's like ooh this is actually should be exciting [laughter] like from that from that perspective. Um cuz you know I might I might get some Black Friday deals but I might not either. And I just want to be prepared from that perspective. And uh, you know, from a trading, you know, viewpoint, it it might be a little bit different.</p>
</details>

#### 标普500指数技术分析

Jason：好的，我们来看看SPY（标普500 ETF）。我屏幕上有20日**SMA**（Simple Moving Average: 简单移动平均线，一种技术分析工具，通过计算特定时期内价格的平均值来平滑价格数据）（白色）、50日SMA（蓝色）和200日SMA（红色）。最重要的事情永远是看这些SMA之间的距离。最好的入场点是当它们非常紧凑的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Yeah. All right. So, I have uh I have the timer on the top left. I'm going to shrink it a little bit. Right now, I'm starting at five minutes. So, this is SPY. Um really quick, I posted something about the SMAs and the on my screen. I have the 20-day, which is white, the 50-day, which is blue, and the 200 day, which is red. And what I will say is, you know, if you've watched this segment for a long time, what I always talk about is the distance in between the SMAs, like the distance in between these SMAs right here. And that that is and always will be the most important thing to to look at. And the best the best entries are are really when it's it's very tight, right?</p>
</details>

目前，这些均线之间的距离非常宽，我们可以看到它们即将收缩。这通常始于跌破20日均线（白色）。今天是第一天我们开盘价低于50日均线（蓝色）。这些线就像磁铁，而不是支撑和阻力位。它们是动量指标，尽管是滞后的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">from a net new money long perspective, what's clear is that okay, so this is this is very wide and and we can see, hey, look, these are about to contract. That's what we can see at the moment. It always starts, by the way, with with the loss of the 20-day simple moving average, which is the white one. And [clears throat] today is the first day that we actually did lose or we opened below the 50-day simple moving average. So that's where we are at the moment. What I will follow this up with with is that these these lines, these little squiggles on my chart are are kind of just that. And they are they're also magnets. So, I don't want you to think of them like support and resistance cuz that is kind of a misnomer. People get that idea, but they should not be thought of like that. They're they're momentum indicators. They're general l they're completely lagging indicators</p>
</details>

现在20日均线开始略微向下倾斜。但也要知道，这些均线非常接近，要交叉还需要一段时间。如果情况真的要转熊，那还需要很长时间。这些均线会像磁铁一样吸引价格。很有可能我们会反弹，50日均线会吸引价格紧贴着它，同时20日均线会追上来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but they will they will give you an idea of momentum and and what you want to look at is the slope. So, right now the 20-day is starting to slope a little bit down if price does continue to go down. But also know that these are very tight together and it's going to be a while before these two can start to cross. And what we're looking for, if things were actually going to if things were actually going to turn kind of bearish, it's going to be a while. And and what these actually do is they act as magnets. So, it's very very possible that we get this pop back up and this 50-day simple moving average acts as a magnet and price hugs it very closely while the 20-day catches up to it.</p>
</details>

如果趋势真的继续下去，那么当你跌破50日均线时，通常会向200日均线移动。历史上几乎每次都是这样。这并不意味着你会跌破它，但你会向它移动。因为目前的斜率非常陡峭且未经修正，今天的趋势（尽管一天不能构成趋势）被打破了。如果继续下去，你提到的那个数字，确实会把你带到615点，那里是200日均线所在的位置。那实际上会是你的买入点，顺便说一下，这也与这边之前的顶部区域相吻合。这将是典型的回调，而不是熊市。要非常清楚，这是典型的回调，而不是熊市。熊市是完全低于所有这些SMA的，我们离那还很远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we do continue from a from a m momentum perspective and what large funds are probably screaming about is that when you lose this, what happens is that you tend when you you lose something like this is that you tend to travel towards the 200 day simple moving average. Here's another one here where you tend to travel towards the 200 day simple here. you tend to travel towards the 200 day simple pretty much nearly every time in history. It doesn't mean that you breach it, but you tend to travel towards it. Let me get back to where we are. And and because this is a very steep and and we'll say uncorrected slope and the trend has as of today, day one, one day doesn't make a trend. We have a lot of news coming. Um [clears throat] basically been today broken. Uh if it if it does continue then that that does I heard you say a number earlier that does bring you to 615 as where the 200 day simple lies and that actually would be your dip by which also by the way kind of lines up with these prior tops over here and that would be that typical um pullback that is not a bare market. That is completely different, right? And and to be crystal clear, that is that is a typical pullback and that is not a bare market. A bare market is completely below all of these SMAs, which we are very far away from. We're not even close to that. So, no, we're not talking bare market. No, we have no signs of bare market. We only have signs of a typical pullback. And that is very to that is absolutely to be expected in any normal sit any normal market. And that right there is actually healthy.</p>

Amit：你认为标普500指数已经见顶了吗？比如在未来一年内，这是周期的顶部吗？从技术角度看有这种说法吗？

<p class="english-text">Amit: Do do you think at all that the there's an argument for the S&P 500 is topped like is there a legitimate claim from a price topped in terms of like for this week? No. for like for the next year like it's the top of the cycle like from a technical does any I mean maybe fundamentals are different but does the technical say that</p>
</details>

Jason：你不能这么说。除非我们持续交易在650以下，否则不行。说未来一年？不，不可能。这种典型的回调通常会这样解决：下跌，然后反弹，形成一个杯柄形态。守住615点非常重要，但我们离触及那个水平还很远。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: you can't you can't say that from a um so we're running out of time but like the only thing here is that here's the last low here's a high here is a lower high that we caught last week and we today as of today have breached that lower low have breached that most recent low unless we're trending below 650 No, I I I just you like for the next year. No, no way, man. No, no, because Okay, so Emit sent me this video earlier and I was trying to understand what his context was. But when I say typical pullback, this typical pullback will normally resolve itself like this, right? Like to be like that's normal. like that would that's that's normally how this pullback will resolve itself. I mean end of story. So defending defending 615 is very important but we are far away from even touching those levels.</p>

#### 英伟达技术分析

Amit：我们来谈谈英伟达，因为它和标普指数息息相关。你怎么看它的价格走势？我想说的一点是，在GTC大会上一个重磅消息后，股价达到了212美元，现在又回落到180美元。有人可能会说，如果Jensen没说那五个季度5000亿美元的营收机会，我们根本不会看到212美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Let's transition into Nvidia then because that I think that goes hand in hand with the S&P. How are you thinking of this one and its price action? The one thing I will say on Nvidia is that we hit 212 on a really big announcement at GTC and now we're back down to 180. One could argue that if he never said the 500 billion in five quarters, we would have never seen 212. So I guess how are you thinking of price action?</p>
</details>

Jason：英伟达的设置和市场完全一样，从SMA的角度来看。但烛台图（价格行为）远比平滑的趋势线更重要。现在英伟达的关键控制点仍然是177美元。那仍然是英伟达的主要关注区域。老实说，我认为财报后的最佳情况是股价相当平稳，甚至可能小幅上涨。但除非你突破200美元，并且是持续交易在200美元以上，否则它并没有真正走出困境。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jason: So Nvidia here, this is one of our charts. If he never said what was it? Yeah. So I mean, you've been saying this a lot and I and I and I couldn't agree more, right? Like earnings are good. I think that's that's true across the board. The the one caveat is that the market is always forward-looking. So what's weird about the market too and and I guess this is a bit of a side note is that the market will punish equities on bad news multiple times over but they won't really uh praise equities [laughter] on the same news multiple times over. So I mean that's that's the market for you. Um we we're in Nvidia is the exact exact same setup as the market from from an SMA perspective. Now, SMAs are not not not price action. That's candlesticks. And candlesticks actually are far superior than a smoothing trend line. Um [clears throat] but uh but right now we're still at the same level on Nvidia and Nvidia's what we call point of control here. Uh this is 177 still. That remains like the main area of interest for Nvidia. Um, I I honestly think the best case scenario on the actual earnings it it's fairly flat. It might even pop up a little bit, but unless you're over quite frankly 200, and I mean like trending over 200, which is right here, it it's not it's not really going to be out of the weeds.</p>

从技术角度看，目前的价格快照看起来像是派发，意味着卖家多于买家。如果当前区域的买家不足以持续推高股价，那么故事告诉我，它可能需要回落到更低的位置，去寻找更多的支撑和买盘兴趣。现在这张图基本上是在告诉我：等等看。它处于一个持有模式。如果它不能创下新高（双顶），那么它就不能。如果下一次上涨无法突破，那很可能就是你需要回落并至少重新测试这些低点的信号。

<details>

<p class="english-text">cuz it there is a um this snapshot essentially right here um from a technical perspective is technically what we would call distributionary, meaning that this looks like more sellers than buyers. And if the if the sell if the buyer is down here, um we're not enough to continuously bring it higher even over here. This [clears throat] trend at this point in time is actually not holding. And so if if these current buyers from this zone, this is the story of this price action. If these current buyers were not enough to sustain this move in this direction to the upside and keep it going and and more buyers did not step in here to continuously push it higher. Well, then quite frankly, what this story is telling me is that it probably needs to come down a little bit lower to come in and visit a little bit lower support to see if there's any more interest to press it higher. And and right now, I think that this chart, not I think this chart is is basically telling me, wait a second, uh just just to wait. It's it's basically in a holding pattern. Um, and if it can't make a new high over the double top, which is the opposite of a double bottom, um, then then it can't, right? And if this next press to the upside can't break through, well then that is probably likely going to be the sign that you do in fact need to come back lower and revisit at least these lows in this general area.</p>

#### 其他关键个股分析

Jason：Robinhood (Hoodie) 和 Palantir 是两只与众不同的股票。这些股票的下跌被买入的速度是我前所未见的。我甚至不记得上一次看到股票被这么快买入是什么时候了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: Hood and Palanteer are two stocks that are just they're just built different. Like these dips on these two stocks. I I have not seen dips get bought this fast. Uh like these two stocks in quite frankly I I I don't even know the last time I've seen stocks get bought up this fast.</p>
</details>

Jason：关于Meta，我们现在正处于一个拓宽区间的正中心。这是试探性买入的位置，正好在那个黄金口袋里。我需要看到结构出现，我还在观察。坦白说，今天它触及我标记的位置，简直不能再完美了。上周二我们谈到，如果跌破633美元，很可能会去到585美元，而这正是发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: so here we are on meta. This is my box. And I think it's it's really important to know that look, we've hit my box. Meta, it's the nibble spot. It is literally right in that golden pocket. Not the golden zone. It's literally here. So, what I need to see now is I need to see that structure show up. And I'm I'm I'm still watching like I mean I don't think this could have tagged my actual spot any more perfectly than it did today. And I mean today when we talked last Tuesday it was very much hey look we lose this 633 we are going to go very likely to 585. And that's quite frankly exactly what happened.</p>
</details>

Jason：关于Nebius，今天的价格行为，也就是烛台图，对它来说是重要的一天。这根单日K线是一个信号。它告诉你，在这一天内发生了一场战斗。空头在开盘时占据主导，股价下跌并创下新低。但在盘中某个时刻，出现了一次反击。防线在82美元守住了，而且不仅仅是防守，更是一次反攻。这次反攻非常强劲，不仅回到了前一天的低点，还一路推高到前一天的中点以上，最终赢得了当天的战斗。这次反攻是这只股票价格走势故事中的一个关键点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: this is an important day for Nebius and this one day candle is uh this is a tell. If candlesticks were a story of if the chart was the story of price action, candlesticks are like the day-to-day drama within the story, right? And and the words or sentences within like this is the alphabet, right? And so what this is telling you is that there was a there was a a singular battle within the day of of Nebus. I mean, sorry to be really dramatic, right? Um, but the battle the battle ensued and and really the bears were in charge today at the beginning of the day cuz we started this little bottom wick means that we started red probably deep red and we started to go down. That's what that means. That's what this is depicting cuz this little bottom wick that's that's what it is. We were we were down we actually were down so much that we were making really new lows. And at some point in the middle of the day, um, there was there was a a push back. There was a a a you know, the the defenses held literally at $82. The defenses held right here and and there was something some it wasn't just a defense, it was a counterattack. Like there was a counterattack that was launched and it it actually was launched so strong that it not only broke back up to the lows of the prior day, but it actually pushed all the way up to the highs to the midpoint of the prior day and up and over that that breach point and actually they won the battle on the day itself. So this this counterattack that was launched by the bear by the bulls on Nebius for today is a pivotal point in the story of of this stock's price action today.</p>
</details>

Jason：关于亚马逊，我确实买了一点，只是非常小的一笔。我买入的原因是看好它更长期的形态。即使再跌一点，我仍然喜欢它未来可能出现的猛烈上涨。因为在所有股票中，亚马逊最接近200日均线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: So, I did buy this one just I mean, it's a tiny nibble. The reason I did is because of the setup like longer term. So, I still like Amazon's setup longer term. And when I It's back to that that SMA, right? Like even though even though like it's more stretched, it's closer in terms of Amazon consolidating. If Amazon consolidates, even if I get a little bit more of a dip, I still like the the idea of a ripsky like that into the foreseeable future. Um, and so because I'm closest to the 200 on Amazon.</p>
</details>

Jason：至于谷歌，它处于超买状态，但没有任何结构被破坏。通常在财报后的大幅上涨后，你只有一次机会创下新高。谷歌已经尝试了三四次，都失败了。这并不意味着坏事，但意味着它不会再走高了，至少会进入一个45天的盘整期。目前谷歌正处于一个完美的收割期权金（卖出看涨期权）的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jason: I mean, oddly, okay, so Google ex it's overextended. Uh, but there is zero structure broken here. What what I will say is that so here's earnings right here. The way that I have a system of like, okay, not a system, but like there's a setup that we know is true is that you you you usually get one shot to to break the highs of a power earnings kind of move. So, if this was the big earnings move right here, uh you usually get one shot to actually make new highs. and and Google has had it shot like three or four times, right? Mhm. And it's failed to make new highs. And so what that means is it doesn't it doesn't mean anything really bad, but it means it's not going higher. And it and it does mean that you are at least minimum going into a uh a 45day hold, right? Lit literally. And so we are currently in about halfway through 45day sideways price action. So Google currently is in a perfect spot to start harvesting premium. Um meaning selling calls and probably puts, but but likely just selling calls right now.</p>

#### 最终结论：保持耐心，忽略噪音

Jason：本周本身，作为一个独立的星期，我认为会非常嘈杂。我预计会有颠簸、两极分化、像发烧梦一样的疯狂波动，有些事情可能会以令人心碎的绝望告终。但请忽略噪音，真的。因为归根结底，像50日均线这样的东西，它们就像磁铁。会有时间做出反应的。我认为现在不是恐慌的时候。如果你现在恐慌，你以后会非常后悔的。

<p class="english-text">Jason: This week by itself as a standalone week I think is going to be very noisy like extremely noisy. I posted something um I don't know if you can pin it uh just just just now on on my ex that I think is like pretty this is my my thoughts honestly on the market is that like it's going to be really noisy with all the stuff that's happening right now and you you you could get faked out in in either way right with early price action throughout the Okay. Uh, I actually expect bumpy bipolar fever dream like manic whipsaws and and um maybe some things end in a gut-wrenching despair, right? But fear, greed, But just ignore the noise, dude. Ignore it. Really, right? Because at the end of the day, you know, things like this 50-day simple moving average, what I posted earlier was that, you know, they act like magnets. And I posted something much earlier here. Uh, and and you may people may have not noticed this, but when I said act like magnets, I don't mean they act like support and resistance. They I mean that they act like magnets. This is meta, right? And so there's going to be time to react. This is magnets. They're not support and resistance. They get sucked and drawn into it, right? And so what what I mean to say is that there's going to be time to react. And I really think that this which is the spy chart, if that 50-day SMA, it's not like you have to sell everything around. I think that you're saying this is not the time to panic. No, I don't. I think if you do that now, you're going to be like really sad about it. [laughter] Like honestly.</p>
