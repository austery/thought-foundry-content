### 播客开场与烘焙趣谈

**Bloomberg:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是Tracy Aloway。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots Podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** Joe，我有一个非常私人的问题要问你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, I have a very personal question to ask you.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我们认识很久了，所以没什么我们不知道的了，但你尽管问吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we've known each other for a very long time, so there's not much left that we don't know, but go for it.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，我其实不知道这个问题的答案。你有没有自己烘焙过什么东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I actually don't know the answer to this question. Have you ever baked anything?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 呃，不多。我经历过一个阶段，但我基本上没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, not that much. I went through this like I'm just going to The answer is basically no. I'm just No.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 等等，你刚才想说什么，你经历过一个阶段？高中时，我曾和我一个朋友对实验性烘焙产生过奇怪的痴迷，我们尝试通过**第一性原理烘焙**（first principles baking: 不依赖食谱，从基本原理出发探索烘焙方法）重新学习烘焙，看看什么方法有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, you were going to say something. You went through a phase. One time in high school, I got in this like weird experimental baking obsession with a friend of mine where we just sort of tried to relearn baking by first principles and see what worked.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 哦天哪，那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my god, what does that mean?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 就是不看任何食谱，只管开始实验，然后看看什么能让东西膨胀，什么味道好，没有任何起始原理或指导。我们只知道一些基本食材。这很有趣，我应该重新开始烘焙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just like not reading any recipe. So, not reading any recipes and just start experimenting and then seeing like what caused things to rise and what tasted good without any starting principles or anything. We knew a few basic ingredients. It's fun. I should get back into baking.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你应该的，真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You should. It's really fun.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Tracy，你呢？我们知道这只是个铺垫，因为你想谈谈你的烘焙。所以，你为什么不直接告诉我们你喜欢烘焙什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you Tracy? We know this is just a setup because you want to talk about your baking. So, why don't you just why don't you just tell us what you like to bake?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嘿，你看，我烘焙得不多。实际上，在我家里，我丈夫烘焙所有东西。他做的**巴斯克芝士蛋糕**（Basque cheesecake: 一种源自西班牙巴斯克地区的芝士蛋糕，特点是表面焦黑）非常好，巧克力曲奇也很好吃，诸如此类。但如果你是做第一性原理烘焙，我想你肯定知道这有多难，以及制作一个简单的面包所涉及的所有环节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, look. I don't bake that much. Actually, in my household, my husband bakes everything. So, he does a really good Basque cheesecake, really good chocolate chip cookies, things like that. But if you were doing first principle baking, I imagine you know how difficult it is and all the things that are involved in just making like a simple loaf of bread.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 呃，我确实知道。另一件事是，我不仅明白它非常复杂，而且除此之外，我总是对**工业规模**（industrial scale: 大规模生产）或半工业规模的烘焙如何运作感到震惊。说实话，我完全不知道。坦白说，所有工业规模的食品准备在我看来都不可思议。比如，如何一遍又一遍地重复制作，并获得一个可重复的过程，这对我来说是个引人入胜的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I I I am aware. And the other thing is not only um I understand that it's uh very complex but beyond that I'm always flabbergasted at the idea of doing it at industrial scale or semi-industrial scale and how that even works. I have no idea to be honest. Honestly, industrial scale food preparation at all seems crazy to me. Like stakes and everything like how do you do it over and over and over again and get a repeatable process is like a fascinating question to me.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 对。所以这本身就很有趣。但正如你刚才指出的，工业规模烘焙业务的另一个有趣之处在于，它是经济的一个缩影。你拥有所有这些**大宗商品投入**（commodity inputs: 用于生产的原材料，如面粉、糖等），它们显然会随着通货膨胀而波动。你面临劳动力问题，需要找到愿意在清晨很早起床工作的面包师。显然，你还需要考虑消费者需求。所以，这是一个非常有趣的视角。我们最喜欢的一期节目，我认为是在2022年或2021年，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So that's really interesting in and of itself. But the other interesting thing about the baking business at industrial scale as you just pointed out is it's kind of a microcosm for the economy. You have all these commodity inputs which obviously move around along with inflation. You have labor issues. You have to get bakers who want to get into work really really early in the morning and obviously you also have consumer demand. So it's really an interesting lens to kind of look through. Well, one of our uh one of our the favorite episodes that we've ever done I which I think was 2022 or maybe 2021,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 很久以前了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">long time ago.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 呃，我们采访了芝加哥的一位商业面包师，我一直想做更多类似的内容。那对我们来说是如此关键的一期节目，我就想，嗯，你知道，我们学到了很多关于大宗商品成本的情况。我们学到了很多关于**定价权**（pricing power: 企业在不损失太多销量的情况下提高产品价格的能力）等方面的情况。现在是2025年了，我想了解更多当前的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we talked to a commercial baker in Chicago and I've always wanted to do more. That was such a pivotal episode for us and I was like, well, you know, we learned a lot about what was going on with uh commodity costs. We learned a lot what was going on with pricing power, etc. Well, it's 2025 now. I would like to learn more about what's going on.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的，所以我们要再次深入烘焙领域。呃，可能不是基于第一性原理，但我们有完美的嘉宾。我们将与Andy Kaden对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so we're going to dive back into baking. Uh, possibly not on a first principle basis, but we have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Andy Kaden. He</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 难道“基于第一性原理的烘焙”不是一个很好的名字吗？那会是一个很好的食谱名字。好了，抱歉，你继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">wouldn't baking baking from first principles be a really good That would be a That would be like a good name for a cookbook. All right, sorry. Keep going.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，也许是烘焙播客的好名字。好的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, good name for a baking podcast, perhaps. Okay,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我们将与Andy Kaden对话。他是洛杉矶一家名为Bub and Grandmas的面包店的老板。他们为洛杉矶的许多餐厅提供**批发订单**（wholesale orders: 大批量销售给其他商家），所以正如你提到的，Joe，是工业规模的。但他们也有一个**零售餐厅**（retail restaurant: 直接面向消费者销售的餐厅），提供三明治，并且正在筹备开一家**披萨店**（pizzeria: 专门制作和销售披萨的餐厅）。真是太棒了，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we're going to be speaking with Andy Kaden. He is the owner of a bakery in LA that's called Bub and Grandmas. They do wholesale orders for a bunch of different LA restaurants, so industrial scale as you mentioned, Joe, but they also have a retail restaurant that does sandwiches and they're in the process of opening a pizzeria. So amazing,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 所有的烘焙食品。Andy，欢迎来到节目。

### 创业之路：从广告人到面包师

**Tracy Aloway:** 我们是否可以从你对面包的兴趣实际从何而来开始谈起？这是否像**新冠疫情**（COVID: 2019冠状病毒病）期间的一种流行现象，每个人都开始做自己的**酸面包**（sourdough: 一种通过天然酵母发酵制作的面包），并对碳水化合物产生了浓厚兴趣？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shall we start out with where did your interest in bread actually come from? Was this like a COVID trope where everyone started doing their own sourdough and got really into carbohydrates</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我可能有点**原始的**（protocoid: 指其痴迷早于某个流行趋势，非因流行而起）痴迷。毕业后，我在广告和电视行业做了大约十年编剧，大约16年前搬到洛杉矶后很快就发现我讨厌这份工作，也讨厌自己为广告文化做贡献。所以我需要逃离，而且我一直痴迷于烹饪和美食。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or I I maybe I'm a little uh uh protocoid in my obsession. I was a writer in advertising and TV for about a decade after school and learned fairly quickly after I got to Los Angeles about 16 years ago that I hated it and hated myself for contributing to sort of the advertising culture. so to speak, and I needed to escape and uh always had an obsession with cooking and eating and um</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我决定专注于我搬到洛杉矶后发现这里缺少的东西。我从小在新泽西长大，那里是意大利裔和犹太裔三明治的圣地。我发现洛杉矶明显缺少那种可以走进去就能吃到美味三明治的体验。虽然有一些著名的店，但它们不像纽约和新泽西那样随处可见。所以，我决定开始写一些商业计划，想办法在这里开一家三明治店。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">decided to focus on something that I saw missing from the Los Angeles landscape after I moved here from the East Coast. I grew up in New Jersey, kind of in a Italian Jewish sandwich mecca. uh and saw saw that there was sort of a a a glaring absence of those style of kind of walk into it and have a great sandwich kind of experience in Los Angeles. There are a few notable spots, but they aren't everywhere like they are in New York and New Jersey. So, I decided to start writing some business plans and figure out how to open a sandwich shop here.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，你知道，我开始在好莱坞一家名为Potato Chips的三明治店周末免费**实习**（staging: 在专业厨房中无偿工作以学习经验），并在各种面包店**见习**（staging: 在专业厨房中无偿工作以学习经验），只是为了弄明白面包是如何制作的。在这个过程中，我试图弄清楚面包的制作原理，仅仅是为了和面包师讨论我想要什么。我开始每天在家烘焙，并进入了那种类似新冠疫情期间的日常烘焙节奏，对烘焙的痴迷也随之而来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and you know, started working at a sandwich shop in Hollywood called Potato Chips for free on the weekends, staging at a variety of bakeries just to try and figure out how bread worked. And and in that process of trying to figure out how bread worked, simply just to talk to bakers about what I wanted. I started baking daily at home and got into that pseudocoid rhythm of daily baking and the obsession of that that comes from falling into its uh you know into its grasp and uh you know</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我开始把我做的所有面包都送出去，结果这些面包传到了我一个在当地餐厅工作的朋友那里，餐厅老板突然打电话给我，问我是否能每天为他做面包，我答应了，这一做就是十年，从未停止。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">started giving away all the bread I was making and it found its way to a friend of mine who worked at a local restaurant and the owner called me out of the blue and asked if I could make bread for him daily and I said yes and it hasn't stopped for 10 years.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 等等，所以最初你只是在你的厨房里大规模烘焙面包吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, so initially were you just baking bread at scale in your kitchen?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我最初只是为了自己，作为一项实验。嗯，但很快，一旦我有了第一个客户，那大概是我开始烘焙六个月后，六个月到一年，关注度很快就来了，我开始需要不断升级。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I started as just for me, just as an experiment. Um, but very quickly kind of once I had that first account, which was maybe 6 months after I started baking, 6 months to a year, it the the attention came quickly and I started needing to level up over and over and over again.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 所以，最初我会在家里混合面包并进行发酵，然后塑形，再把它带到街角的一家披萨店，用他们的披萨烤箱烘烤。这是各种拼凑起来的，在其他面包店的非营业时间进行烘焙以完成工作。随着需求迅速增长，我很快就必须弄清楚如何经营一家企业，而不仅仅是在家里烘焙几条面包。嗯，大约一年半后，我搬进了一个**半合法空间**（semi-legitimate space: 介于家庭厨房和完全商业化空间之间的过渡性场所）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the first place that I I would mix the bread in my house and ferment it there and then shape it and take it to a pizza place around the corner and bake it in their pizza oven. It was a variety of these hacked together baking in other bakeries off hours to get to get things done. And as the the demand grew very quickly, I I quickly had to figure out how to run a business, not just bake a few loaves of bread out of my house. um and moved into a semi semi-legitimate space at about a year and a half.</p>
</details>

### 业务规模与扩张：批发与零售并进

**Tracy Aloway:** 快进到今天，从宏观角度看，你能不能告诉我们你业务的规模和范围？你现在有多少产量和员工数量？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Flash forward to today, zooming out, why don't you tell us about the size and scope of your businesses? What do you have right now just in terms of volume and number of employees, stuff like that?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 批发面包店，也就是那个故事发展而来的业务，现在是一个拥有50名员工的企业。我们有一个6500平方英尺的设施，为洛杉矶大约180家餐厅生产面包，只生产面包，不生产糕点。这是一个相当广泛的配送网络，我们仍在努力发展。我们在这个空间里已经**满负荷运作**（wall-to-wall: 形容空间利用到极致，没有多余容量），需要在未来两年内搬迁。所以，我们正在开始调查那会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The wholesale bakery, which is what that story evolved into, is now a 50 person business. We have a 6,500 foot facility that produces bread, just bread, not pastry, for about 180 restaurants in Los Angeles. It's a pretty wide distribution and we are still trying to grow. We're kind of wallto-wall in that space and need to move in the next two years. So, we're starting to investigate what that would look like.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我们还在差不多三年前开了一家零售餐厅，三年过得如此之快真是令人难以置信，就像我们现在所处的这个奇怪的时间漩涡一样。呃，那也是一个将近50人的企业，位于洛杉矶的Glassell Park社区。我们正在邻近的Highland Park社区筹备开一家披萨店。嗯，希望能在未来四到五周内开业。那将再增加30名员工，并随着时间推移增长到50人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also opened a retail restaurant almost 3 years ago, which is insane how quickly that 3 years has passed um in our weird time vortex that we live within now. And uh that is another almost 50 person business um in the Glassel Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. We are in the process of opening a pizza place in Highland Park, a neighboring neighborhood. Um that will be open hopefully in the next four to five weeks. So that'll be another 30 employees growing to 50 over time.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 你为什么决定开一家零售三明治店呢？因为我想批发业务听起来其实挺不错的，你仍然在生产产品，但却脱离了与顾客面对面的互动，这对我来说听起来不错，但显然你持不同意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why did you decide to do the uh the retail sandwich shop? Because I imagine wholesale actually sounds kind of nice because you're still making a product but you're divorced from uh face-to-face interactions with customers which sounds nice to me but obviously you have a different opinion.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 不，我没有。嗯，我的意思是，我们从批发开始。在业务的前五年，我们是在这种不那么吸引人、不那么面向客户的环境中起步的，然后我们才改变方向，开设了零售餐厅。批发业务是一个更稳定的船。我把它描述为，你知道，你有一艘大船，它在水里上下起伏，但最终是向前行驶的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I don't. Um, I mean, we started with wholesale. We started in this less sexy, less customer-f facing environment for the first, say, 5 years of the business before we, you know, changed gears to open the retail restaurant. The wholesale business is a much more steady ship. I I sort of describe it as, you know, you have this big ship. it it's moving up and down in the in the water, but ultimately is forward moving.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 它更难倾覆，更难偏离航线，这使得它稍微不那么疯狂。餐饮业，也就是我最初想进入的行业，如果我当时就知道它现在会是什么样子，你知道，也许继续做批发会更好，它要困难得多。它更具动态性。一切都在不断变化。要隔离变量要困难得多。在餐厅里需要考虑的变量要多得多，尤其是当你引入顾客行为以及事物如何持续全面波动时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it's harder to capsize. It's harder to knock off course, and that makes it a little bit, let's say, less crazy. The restaurant business, which was what I wanted to get into in the first place had I known what it would be like uh at the now that I'm there, you know, maybe wholesale would have been better to stay at, it's so much harder. It's much more dynamic. Everything is changing all the time. much more difficult to isolate the variables. There's far more variables to consider in the restaurant, especially when you bring in customer customer behaviors and how things really just consistently fluctuate across the board.</p>
</details>

### 物流配送：洛杉矶的挑战与策略

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们讨论的许多话题中，有一个共同的主题是配送，包括销售方面的配送和物理配送。这在洛杉矶是如何运作的？你们有自己的货车吗？是否有第三方将面包送到餐厅？请谈谈你们是如何建立这个网络，以及面包是如何从你们的商业面包店实际运送到餐厅的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the themes that comes up in a range of topics that we talk about is distribution and actual like both distribution in terms of sales but also the physical distribution. How does it work in Los Angeles? Do you have your own vans? Are there third parties that drop off the uh bread to the restaurants? Like talk about how you like built up that network and how the bread physically gets from your commercial bakery into the restaurants.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 当然。是的，我们目前有六辆货车，或是租赁的，或是自有的。建立这个完整的网络一直是一项极其艰巨的任务，因为它占据了我们工作非常重要的一部分，尤其因为我们已经**满负荷运作**（wall-to-wall: 形容空间利用到极致，没有多余容量）。当我说满负荷运作时，基本上意味着每小时的烤箱空间已经没有多余容量来增加新的面包产量了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. Yeah, we have currently we have six vans that are either leased or owned and it's been a bit of an excruciating endeavor building out this whole network because it is a major major part of what we do especially because we're wallto-wall. When I say wall to- wall, it basically means there is literally no more oven space per hour available for for new loaves of bread to increase our production.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 所以，如果你凌晨2:30开始烘焙，并且需要在早上8点餐厅开门前将面包送到所有这些客户那里，你只有一个非常狭窄的时间窗口来冷却面包、打包面包、装上货车，并将其送到这些客户手中。所以，我们面包店的**运营团队**（ops team: 负责日常运营管理和协调的团队）在规划这些路线方面真是天才，因为你只有一个非常狭窄的时间间隔需要把握。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you start baking at 2:30 in the morning and you need to get bread to all of these accounts before they open at 8:00 a.m., you have a very narrow window to cool that bread, pack that bread, get it into the vans, and get it out to these uh accounts. So, our ops team at the bakery are true geniuses in building out these routes because you have only have this very narrow gap to hit.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 如果遇到洛杉矶著名的交通堵塞，或者烘焙过程中出现任何延误，你就会手忙脚乱，确保以一种能让客户正常工作的方式来服务他们。所以我们不仅要做好烘焙工作，还要在他们上班前，在我们的客户的任何其他人上班前，完成配送工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if there's famous LA traffic or anything else that uh gets backed up in the baking process, you are scrambling to try and make sure that you take care of these accounts in a way where they can still do their jobs. So we have to do our job not only just the baking job but the distribution job before they show up before anybody else uh from our accounts show up to work.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 此外，货车本身也问题重重。它们是出故障、需要维修、需要关注的首要问题，甚至比我们几乎不停歇使用的烤箱还要多。我们已经探索了许多不同的选择，尤其是在我们可能搬到更大空间时，考虑外包我们的配送。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also the vans themselves are you know deeply problematic. They are the number one number one thing that breaks needs service needs attention you know more even more so than our ovens which are in near constant use. And we have explored a number of different options especially for when we potentially move to a bigger space about outsourcing our distribution.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，有很多新兴的批发配送公司，其中一些总部设在洛杉矶，更多在旧金山，它们采取的是**优步模式**（Uber approach: 指通过平台连接司机和客户，实现灵活的按需配送服务），外包司机或拥有一个专门的司机池，这些司机与各种不同的客户合作，而不是一对一的服务。所以，你知道，我们业务面临的主要问题之一是货车维修和维护费用的波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there are a lot of upstart wholesale distribution companies some of which are based in in LA a lot more in San Francisco that are sort of taking the Uber approach um and outsourcing their drivers or having a dedicated pool of drivers who work with a variety of different accounts as opposed to onetoone. So that you know one of the major issues with our business is the you know fluctuating repair and maintenance numbers for our vans.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 如果我们能把这个负担转嫁给别人，那当然是我们考虑过的事情。但当我们参与这些讨论时，我们总是回到同一个地方：是的，我们不是一个面向消费者的公司，但我们的业务依赖于厨师和我们的司机之间的那次单一互动。他们是我们与客户的联系点。如果这种联系不真实，如果我们的员工没有与客户建立联系，那么事情就有可能出错，这种关系就有可能恶化。所以，我们目前还是坚持使用自己的员工和自己的货车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we can offload that to someone else, that is something that we have certainly looked into. But when we get into the mix with these conversations, we always kind of end in the same place where yes, we are not a con customer, you know, a consumerf facing company, but our business relies on that single interaction between the chefs and our drivers. They are our point of contact with our customers. And if that is not an authentic connection, if that is not something our employees are connecting with our customers, there's a potential for things to go wrong and a potential for that relationship to be soured. So we've ultimately stuck with our own employees and our own vans for now.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** Tracy，我只是在想，像你这样对面包感兴趣的人，突然间却要处理刹车片问题，这该有多疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I'm just thinking about how crazy it must be to like have an interest in bread such as yourself and then suddenly like you're in the brake pad</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 变成一个机械师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">become a mechanic.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 不，你也在做刹车维修业务，你必须把这考虑进去。不，我当时也在想同样的事情。我想，当人们想象一家面包店时，不一定会想到它的运输和配送方面。但是Andy，你刚才提到了凌晨2:30和狭窄的配送窗口。我必须问，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, you're at the break of repair business too and you got to take that into account. No, I was thinking the same thing. And it's something that I guess when people envision a bakery, you don't necessarily think about the uh transportation and delivery aspect of it. But Andy, you mentioned 2:30 a.m. just then and the narrow window for delivery. And I have to ask,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 招募那些愿意在凌晨1点左右起床去烤面包的工人是什么感觉？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's it like getting actual workers in the door who uh who want to, I guess, wake up at like 1:00 a.m. in the morning and go bake bread?</p>
</details>

### 劳动力挑战与生活方式

**Andy Kaden:** 是的，这很棘手。你知道，首先，你必须热爱它。嗯，你必须热爱这个过程。我的意思是，凌晨2:30这个时间，你知道，非常非常早，是一种非常非常不同的生活方式。嗯，从字面上讲，你下午5:30就睡着了。这意味着，你知道，你与家人、朋友的联系，你和他们完全不在同一个时区运作。如果人们不按照你的时间表运作，事情就会变得复杂。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's uh it's tricky. you know, you first of all, you have to love it. Um, you have to love the process. And I mean, the 230 aspect is is, you know, very very early and a very very different lifestyle. Um, in a in a literal way, you are falling asleep at 5:30 p.m. And that means that your, you know, connection with your family, your connection with your friends, you're operating on a completely different time zone than they are. And it makes things complicated if folks are not operating on the same schedule as you.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 但你知道，那是我做的最后一次烘焙班次，是周日早上2:30为好莱坞农贸市场烘焙。我会在凌晨2点起床，开车去面包店。只有我一个人在黑暗中。很多人刚从周六晚上的各种派对回来。嗯，这让开车去那里有点危险，但我总是很小心。然后，你知道，完成烘焙，打包，装上我的卡车，然后去农贸市场销售。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But you know the it's I that was the last baking shift that I that I did was the Sunday morning 2:30 a.m. bake for the Hollywood Farmers Market. I would, you know, get up at 2, roll down to the bakery. It would be just me in the dark. A lot of people returning from their various parties on Saturday night. Um, which made driving there a little bit sketchy, but always, you know, being careful. and then, you know, finish the bake, pack it up, put it in my truck, and go to the farmers market and and sell it.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，然后一天会在2:30左右结束。所以，那会是12小时的冲刺，然后销售，然后回来。你知道，在某个时候，那是我唯一做的烘焙班次，因为我必须在一周的其他日子里管理业务。当你一周只在凌晨2:30烘焙一天时，它会极大地扰乱你的思绪和睡眠时间，我最终不得不放弃它，只是因为我需要更多时间来管理业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and then the day would wrap up around 2:30. So, it would be this 12-h hour kind of sprint and then sale and then come back. And, you know, at a certain point, it was the only bake shift that I was doing because I had to manage the business during the other days of the week that I was not doing that. And when you just bake one day a week at 2:30 in the morning, it scramles your mind so wildly. and your sleep schedule that I had to eventually abandon it just because I needed more time to manage the businesses.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 但你真的必须适应这种生活方式。如果你试图挑战极限，你知道，尤其是我当时每周烘焙五天，同时还要管理业务，经常生病。当你跨越两个时区运作时，真的很难保持健康。你生活在这样一种状态，哦，我的妻子和朋友都生活在这个时区，而我的业务生活在另一个时区，我需要同时兼顾两者，那对我自己的健康来说是更加复杂的时期。呃，但我们现在已经度过了那个阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you really have to subscribe to the lifestyle. If you try and push the edge, you know, especially when I was baking and managing five days, baking 5 days a week and still trying to manage the business was getting sick a lot. It was very difficult to stay healthy when you're operating across two, you know, time zones really. you're you're living in this kind of uh oh my wife and my friends are all living in this time zone and my business is living in this time zone and I need both I need to be there for both those were were far more complicated times for my own health.

### 招聘与原材料成本：现状分析

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们一开始就提到了，你知道，我们喜欢这个话题，因为它就像一个看万物的镜头。但你今天看到了什么？如果你把现在和刚开始的时候，或者和通货膨胀高峰期相比，今天在招聘可用性和原材料成本方面情况如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We mentioned in the beginning um you know we like this topic because it's sort of a lens into everything but what are you seeing today in terms of you know if you compare now to when you started how do think or versus the peak of the inflation whatever it was how do things look today when it comes to both hiring availability and also um raw commodity cost ingredient costs</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 招聘可用性对我们来说很特别，呃，显然我们正在寻找一群非常专业的人。所以他们希望已经具备的技能在洛杉矶供应稀缺，呃，这使得招聘变得复杂，批发面包店比餐厅更甚。餐厅的招聘池要宽广得多，我们在餐厅招聘方面几乎没有遇到麻烦。嗯，面包店则不然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hiring availability is unique for us uh obviously we are looking for a very specialized group of people. So the skills that they hopefully already have are in in rare supply in Los Angeles and uh that makes hiring complicated far more so for the wholesale bakery than for the restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of over the pool is much wider and we have very little trouble hiring at the restaurant. um the bakery.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 很快问一下，你在2022年或2023年也会说同样的话吗？还是说今天在零售层面感觉比那时更容易？因为那时所有的抱怨都在零售层面，对吧？所有的餐厅和服务实体都在抱怨招聘有多么不可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Real quickly, is that would you have said this same thing in 2022 or 2023 or does it feel easier today than it would have back then at the at the retail level? Because that's where that's where like all the complaints were, right? Everyone all the restaurants and service entities were complaining about how impossible it was.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我认为，如果你没有一个人们已经知道的名字，那是不可能的。嗯，我认为对我们来说，我们投入了大量精力确保我们的员工得到良好的照顾、支持和像对待人一样被对待。嗯，我认为当我们在面包店之后开餐厅时，这一点在公众眼中已经有所建立。所以，嗯，这有助于我们进行这个尝试。我的意思是，所有这一切的重点是，我们希望这里成为一个理想的工作场所，这样当人们来到这里时，他们会感到愉快，得到良好的支持，有饭吃，受到良好待遇，有医疗保健。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think that it's I think that it's impossible if you don't already have a name um that people know. Um, and I think for us, we've spent a lot of our efforts making sure that our employees are well taken care of and supported and treated like the human beings that they are. Um, and I think that when we open the restaurant after the bakery, that was already somewhat established in the in the public eye. So, um, that helps us to kind of make this play. I I mean this is the the point of it all is we want to make this a desirable place uh for for people to work so that when they come here they have a good time, they're well supported, they get fed, they get treated well, they have healthcare and</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你知道，我们真的就是以此为基础建立起来的。嗯，要经营一个包含所有这些要素的正常运作的企业变得越来越困难，这才是真正的问题所在，因为开支不断增加，而销售额却保持不变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know we um really built this thing on that. um it's becoming harder and harder to have a functional business including all of those things which is you know the real issue at hand here is that the expenses are enumerating and the um you know sales remain the same.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，当我们谈到原材料时，我们现在的状况实际上比一年前甚至更早的时候要好得多。面包店只用一种食材：面粉。面粉是小麦，小麦，你知道，是一种全球性大宗商品，波动很大。与其他大宗商品相比，它通常相当稳定。但举例来说，当俄乌战争爆发时，俄罗斯不允许乌克兰的小麦离开该国，而乌克兰是欧洲的“面包篮子”小麦供应国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so when we talk about raw materials, there's been there's we're actually in a much better place than we were say a year ago or even a year before that. The the bakery goes by one ingredient. It's flour. Flour flour is wheat and wheat is uh, you know, a global commodity that has uh a lot of fluctuations. It's usually compared to others fairly steady. But for example, when the Russia Ukraine war broke out there uh Russia was not allowing Ukraine's wheat to leave the country, Ukraine is the sort of bread basket provider of wheat for Europe.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 当这种情况发生时，来自美国的需求会更多。价格上涨，而美国小麦的美国用户最终会支付更多，以便这些产品能运到欧洲，弥补供应损失。嗯，所以我们看到面粉价格上涨了大约10%。这导致我们不得不长时间以来首次提高面包价格。嗯，现在价格已经回落。呃，但与此同时，其他一切都变得更贵了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when that happens, there's much more demand coming from the United States. Prices go up and the American users of American wheat are the ones who end up paying more so that those products end up in Europe to cover for the loss of supply. Um, so we saw maybe a 10 10% increase in flower pricing. It caused us to have to drive our prices up for the first time uh in a long time bread-wise. Um uh now it has settled back down. Uh but in the meantime, everything else has gotten more expensive.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你知道，现在洛杉矶正经历一波大规模的餐厅倒闭潮，包括昨天拥有117年历史的Kohl's餐厅宣布关闭。经营了100年的The Pantry也关闭了。在这个城市，餐厅要生存，更不用说繁荣发展，都面临着非常非常非常非常困难的时期。所以，嗯，这无疑是一个有趣的时代。

So, um interesting times for sure.</p>

### 大宗商品采购与定价策略

**Tracy Aloway:** 就在大宗商品方面，像面粉这样的东西是如何采购的？你们是否与供应商签订远期协议，以某个价格锁定？我想，这些价格会设定多长时间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just on the commodities front, how does it work in terms of actually sourcing things like flour? Do you sign, you know, forward agreements with suppliers um at a certain price? And I I guess like how long-term are those prices set?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 是的，这非常取决于销量。我们处于一个非常独特的中间地带，我们既不是一个25000平方英尺的巨型面包店，也不是一个更偏向零售的2000平方英尺的面包店。我们正处于中间，希望实现飞跃，直接从我们的供应商那里采购。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's it's um depends very much on volume and we are in this very unique sort of middle ground where we are not a giant 25,000 foot bakery and we are not one of the sort of more retail oriented 2,000 ft² bakeries. We are in the middle looking to make this leap to where we can buy directly from our purveyors and</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 当我们可以直接从供应商（非分销商）那里采购时，比如直接从King Arthur、直接从Cameas Country Mill、直接从各种其他面粉供应商那里采购，并且能够大规模采购，比如一次采购17到20托盘的面粉，我们就可以与King Arthur和其他一些供应商锁定远期价格。但目前，我们通过分销商运营，受制于他们的加价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when we can like purveyors as in non-distributors directly from King Arthur directly from Cameas Country Mill directly from you know a variety of other flower purveyors and when we can do those types of things and buy at scale say 17 to 20 pallets of flour at a time we can lock in forward pricing with King Arthur with some of the other ones but in in the moment now where we're operating through distributors we are subject to their markup and</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 他们根据他们用来计算合理价格的算法来波动他们的定价，这不仅取决于他们从实际生产商那里获得的成本，还取决于他们的业务状况以及他们需要包含的加价。所以，在这种情况下，我们和大多数餐厅所做的就是定期让分销商相互竞争我们的业务，尤其因为我们的面粉订单量很大，这给了我们很大的议价能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They they are fluctuating what they're doing based on whatever algorithms they're they're using to calculate proper pricing not only just from what they're getting charged from the you know the actual producer but also um however their business is doing and whatever you know markup they need to to include. So what we do in that circumstance and what most restaurants do is regularly pit distributors against each other for our business especially because we have a lot of leverage with our flower orders.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 这是一个相当大且定期的订单。所以即使他们每袋只赚取很少的利润，但由于销量大、频率高，这些供应商也会争相给出更低的价格。在这种关系中，没有服务，也没有其他真正重要的东西。只要你能给我们价格，我们这周就会向你订购，他们也知道这一点，并为此竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's it's a fairly significant regular order. So even if they're making a very small amount on that uh on each bag there there's a large volume and a large frequency that has those purveyors kind of jockeying for the lower price and that's there's no service there's no anything else that that really matters in that relationship. It's just if you can get us the price we will order from you this week and and they know that and they fight</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 而且这是每周的价格。呃，目前比每周更频繁。有一些波动。六月，六月，你知道，我经常和King Arthur交谈，他们是我们主要的面包面粉供应商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's a weekly price. Uh it's it's more frequent than week weekly at the moment. There's a little bit of flux. June June uh you know and I've just have regular conversations with King Arthur who's our main bread flour supplier</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，他们是这个国家最棒的企业之一，都是好人，而且总是，你知道，乐于帮助他们的客户。嗯，他们总是监控大宗商品期货以及未来的走势。我有时会联系他们，了解他们如何根据销售给分销商的价格来定价，这样我就可以知道价格上涨是来自分销商还是来自King Arthur，然后我就知道我是否有能力进一步压价，争取更便宜的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um who are one of the most wonderful businesses in the country and just good people and and always you know driven to to help their uh clients. um they always are monitoring you know the commodity future futures and how things are looking going forward and I will sometimes reach out to them to find out you know how how they are pricing things relative to who they're selling to the distributors so that I can see if the the increases in price are coming via the distributor or via King Arthur and then I'll know whether I have some leverage to kind of push down a little bit further to try and fight for cheaper</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 但曾有一个大涨幅。你知道，价格一直在下降，那场战争，你知道，禁运解除了，或者是什么原因让乌克兰的小麦得以出口。所以美国的价格回落了，因为出口减少了。嗯，你知道，如果你持续监控它，它会经常发生微小的变化，但如果你将这些变化累积到一整批磨碎的小麦上，那将是几十万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there was a big spike. You know, things have been trending downward in in price that that uh the war, you know, the embargo opened up or whatever it was that opened up and allowed the wheat to leave Ukraine. So prices in the states settled back down because there's less exports. Um, and it's a um, you know, something that if you're constantly monitoring it um, is changing very often um, in in minor increments, but if you do that across an entire batch of mil wheat, that's that's hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 那么，这实际上是如何影响你们面包的价格的呢？它们有多动态？如果有一天价格上涨，你们会立即转嫁给顾客吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how does that actually feed into your prices for bread? Like, and how dynamic are they? If you get a price increase um, one day, do you immediately pass that through to the customer?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 几乎从不。嗯，你知道，目前价格的涨跌幅度相当小。它们在波动，但大致保持在同一范围内。你知道，如果我们谈论具体数字，我们说的是每150磅面包面粉袋的价格在15到17.50美元之间。这种波动就保持在这个区域。也许一年前，价格高达23美元。如果你想想看，如果我们每周订购，比如说，5000磅面粉，实际上比这更多。我认为接近6500磅，而我们谈论的是一美元的波动。这在我们的最终利润上是一个巨大的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Almost never. Um and that that's you know the the increases and decreases are uh fairly minor at the moment. They are in flux but they are staying in the general vicinity. You know if we're talking specifics we're talking about somewhere between 15 and 1750 for 150 lb bag of bread flour. And that fluctuation it stays in that zone. Maybe a year ago it was up at 23. And if you think about that, if we're ordering, let's say, 5,000 pounds a week of flour, it's actually more than that. I think it's closer to 6,500 pounds and we're talking about a fluctuation of a dollar. That is a massive change in our endofear, you know, bottom line.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 所以，即使是在15到17美元的范围内波动，而不是涨到每袋23美元，对我们来说，持续关注它也是至关重要的。但在转嫁价格方面，我们给自己设定了一个相当宽泛的范围来保持价格的有效性，并且我们一直在密切关注。但总的来说，面包的食品成本并不是主要问题，除非价格从每袋15美元跳到23美元。主要问题是劳动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's it's the kind of thing where if there are any changes whatsoever within that zone, they're multiplied over a large number of bags and end up changing things fairly significantly. So, we really have to even if it's within that 15 to 17 range as opposed to going all the way up to $23 a bag, that is um it's crucial for us to stay on top of it. But in terms of passing the pricing on, we've given ourselves a pretty wide range to stay within that makes our pricing valid and we're constantly staying on top of it. But bread in general, the food cost is not the main issue unless you're talking about a jump from $15 a bag to $23 a bag. The main issue is labor.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 因为面包的销售成本（COGS）通常在10%到15%的范围内，这是你能生产的最便宜的食品，即使你像我们一样使用非常棒的食材。问题是，它需要大量的人力，而且是大量熟练的人力来执行生产。所以如果我们谈论传统模式，你看到劳动力成本占30%，我们这里劳动力成本占42%，销售成本占12%，而餐厅食品业务环境中的销售成本通常在25%到30%之间，如果你经营得还不错的话。我们是14%。所以批发领域和零售餐厅的模式有点不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The main issue is labor because cogs typically with bread are in the, you know, 10 to 15% range, which is the cheapest food product you can possibly make, even if you're using like really fantastic ingredients like we are. The thing is is it just takes a lot of human beings and a lot of skilled human beings to execute production. So if we're talking about the traditional model where you see like 30% for labor, we're looking at more 42% for labor and 12% for COGS where COGS typically in a restaurant food business environment is somewhere to 25 to 30 if you're doing okay. We're at 14. So they the model is a little bit different in the wholesale universe than it is in the retail restaurant.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你知道，我们能够拥有这些额外的人手来完成工作，因为商品成本非常低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that that is uh you know we're able to have those extra bodies to get things done because the cost of goods are so low.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这太引人入胜了。我们继续讨论这个。你正在谈论你的批发配送面包店，当你谈到餐厅时。你通常如何看待涨价策略？因为显然，你知道，你不会对日复一日或月复一月的情况敏感。我猜大多数公司都希望以半定期的方式，也许一年一次或类似的方式，进行某种程度的价格上涨。但总的来说，请谈谈你多久做一次涨价决定以及何时涨价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is fascinating. Let's continue on this. You're talking about your wholesale distribution bakery when you're talking about the restaurant. How do you think that generally about the strategy of price increases because obviously you know you're not going to be sensitive to the day-to-day or the monthtomonth. My guess is many most companies want to pass some sort of price increase on on a semi-regular basis maybe once a year or something but generally like talk about like how frequently you make those decisions to incre increase prices and when.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 是的，我想说我们不像大型面包店那样有固定的时间表。我认为当你达到我们这样的规模或更大时，从运营角度来看，有一种倾向是定期进行这些调整。对我们来说，更多的是确保我们的客户得到他们期望的产品，并且在销售成本对我们来说不是真正问题的情况下，在一定范围内浮动价格，不给他们增加额外负担。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I would say that we are less uh on on a schedule than is typical for a larger bakery. I think when you get to scale like us or larger, there's an inclination just from oper the operations side of things to make these these changes regular. And for us, it's more about making sure that our accounts are getting what they expect and are not being pushed further when it's no real issue for us relative to COGS to float a little bit of that within a range.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 监控竞争对手的定价也更加重要。我们的产品并非完全是“苹果对苹果”的比较，我们谈论的是两种不同的基本产品，我们称之为“**家常面包**”（house loaf），但大多数地方称之为“**乡村面包**”（country loaf），即基本的**酸面包**（sourdough loaf）。你知道，我们批发价是6美元，而其他许多地方可能要价7.50美元，但他们的面包比我们的重250克，或者有其他差异。所以很难追踪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also even more relevant to monitor our competitors pricing. Our products are not entirely apples to apples talking about two different basic what we call a house loaf but most places call a country loaf basic sourdough loaf of bread which I you know we charge $6 for wholesale and a lot of other places might charge $750 but their loaf is 250 grams heavier than ours or some other difference. So it's difficult to track.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 但就我们客户的底线而言，我们必须保持在一个范围内。嗯，我们是高端批发产品，这也使我们独一无二。呃，但与此同时，这并不意味着我们不与那些生产更多商业化机械化面包的竞争对手竞争。所以我们必须非常注意竞争对手的价格。我想说，这种现实加上销售成本的一些上涨，是推动我们涨价的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in terms of what the bottom line is for our customers we have to stay within a range. Um we are a higherend wholesale product which makes us unique as well. Uh but at the same time that doesn't mean that we're not competing with those who are making some more you know sort of commercially mechanized loaves of bread. So we have to be very mindful of our competitors prices. And I would say that reality mixed with some of the increases in hogs are what drive our price increases.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我想我们过去四年里大概涨价了两次。你知道，我认为当面粉价格比现在每袋贵8美元时，我们别无选择。等到我们能够把价格降下来时，我想那大概是今年五月左右。所以，这些高价持续了很长一段时间。其他开支，比如劳动力和外部因素，已经上涨到我们无法再降低价格的程度。事情就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say we've raised prices maybe twice in the last four years. You know, I think we we had no choice when bags were all the way up at $8 more per than they are now. And by the time we were able to bring that price back down, which I think I would say, you know, was around May of this year. So, it's a really long time of these elevated prices. Other expenses like labor and outside things are have increased to the point where we can't lower the prices back down. It's just the way that it goes.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 尽管我很想这样做，因为我非常感受到将节省下来的成本转嫁给客户的好处，但在某个时候，你必须保护企业，这就是我们现在的处境。

<details>

<p class="english-text">As much as I'd like to because I I I feel the benefit very, you know, I feel the benefit from passing savings off to the to our accounts, but at a certain a certain point, you have to protect the business, and that's that's where we're at.</p>

<p class="english-text">So I mentioned at the beginning that you're in the process of opening a pizzeria. So congratulations on that on the expansion.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 但我们现在经常听到的一种说法是，监管正在拖慢企业发展。特朗普政府似乎肯定有放松监管的倾向，人们普遍认为所有这些规定和官僚主义确实会拖慢事情的进展。所以我想知道，你们开披萨店的过程是怎样的？你们做了多久了？我想，你们实际需要处理多少文书工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But one thing we hear a lot about nowadays is the idea of you know regulation slowing down businesses. And there seems to be certainly a dereg bent in the Trump administration and a general sense that all these rules and bureaucracy really slow things down. And so I'm curious, what's the process been like for you in opening the pizza restaurant? How long have you been doing it? And I guess how much paperwork have you actually had to do?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，洛杉矶在餐饮界以其政府监管机构的无能而闻名。我们必须同时与县和市打交道。有建筑安全部门和卫生部门。他们之间不沟通，但他们都在看同样的事情，而且他们都把你指向不同的方向，当检查员开始出现时，事情就变得非常复杂，这贯穿整个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Los Angeles in within the restaurant world is fairly famous for the ineptitude of its governmental oversight agencies. We have to sort of deal with both the county and the city. There's building and safety and the health department. They don't talk to each other, but you're they're both kind of looking at the same thing, and they both point you in different directions, and it gets very complicated when the inspectors start showing up, which is throughout the process.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 关于披萨店的情况是，它是一个**二代空间**（second gen space: 指之前已被用作同类业务的场所）。它以前就是一家披萨店。话虽如此，我们正在，你知道，拆除所有设备并重建它。但这大大加快了进程。如果我，你知道，我不想说什么，或者以任何方式绝对化，但我再也不会做**一代空间**（first gen space: 指从零开始建设的场所）了。嗯，因为它简直是折磨。

<p class="english-text">The thing about the pizza place is that it was a second gen space. It was already a pizzeria. That said, we're, you know, stripping out all the equipment and rebuilding it. But that makes the process significantly faster. And if I, you know, I don't want to say anything uh or be an absolutist in any way, but I will never do a firstg space ever again. Um because it's just excruciating.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你知道，当我们开餐厅时，我们在2019年11月签署了租约。所以，考虑到疫情，我们花了三年时间才开业。其中很大一部分是由于城市的问题。你知道，很多事情都非常**模拟化**（analog: 指使用纸质文件和人工流程，而非数字化系统）。他们会打印你的申请，然后它就放在某人桌上的一堆纸里，如果你不不停地跟进，那堆纸就会越堆越高，你的申请就会深深地消失在，你知道，那堆文件里。

<p class="english-text">And you know, when we opened the restaurant, we signed our lease in November of 2019. So taking you know, obviously there's a pandemic to consider, but it took us three years to open. A lot of that was due to problems with the city. You know, a lot of it is very analog. they print up your application and it sits on a literal stack on someone's desk and if you don't follow up with them incessantly that stack just gets piled on top and your thing just disappears deep into the uh you know into the pile.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 所以这是一个非常非常非常困难的过程。我是否认为完全相反的做法，即把所有东西都简化到极致，就是答案？绝对不是。但是，你知道，洛杉矶有很多**繁文缛节**（red tape: 指官僚主义的规章制度，通常效率低下）需要应对。而且这些繁文缛节也很昂贵。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So it's it's a very very very difficult process. Do I think the exact opposite just stripping down things to nothing is the is the uh answer? Definitely not. But you know LA has a lot of red tape to navigate. It also is expensive red tape to navigate.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，所以你为，你知道，某种非服务支付了巨额费用，而且这让事情变得非常复杂。你可能已经到了终点线，准备开业了，结果卫生检查员在最后一天走进来，说：“这个地漏的位置不对，与他们八个月前批准的计划不符，而且是另一个人批准的。”呃，然后你别无选择，只能额外花费8000美元重新布设管道，然后再进行一次管道检查。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, so you're paying a ton for, you know, sort of non-service and making things really complicated for you. You can get to the very very end of the finish line and you're you're ready to open and the health inspector walks in on the last day and says, "This floor drain is not in the right place based on the plans that they approved and you know, eight months ago from somebody else." Uh, and then you have no choice but to spend an extra $8,000 rerouting your plumbing and then getting plumbing inspection again.</p>

**Andy Kaden:** 我在大学时在一家尼日利亚餐厅工作过，我从不谈论它，但它就像《熊》（The Bear: 一部关于餐厅的电视剧）一样吗？当人们听到所有这些关于“哦，你必须移动排水管”的事情时，是不是就是那样？当时是不是有什么关于气球之类的东西？我不记得具体场景了，但压力是不是那么大，以至于你知道，他们进来时，每个人都屏住呼吸，担心他们是否会发现什么，然后你才能开门。100%是这样，100%是这样。

</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 当一个挂着胸牌的市政人员进来时，餐厅经理们心中产生的恐惧是压倒性的。Slack上的消息会立即发出，每个人都迅速行动起来，因为他们要求的很多事情都不合逻辑，毫无意义，只是为了勾选1965年某个荒谬的、现在已经不适用的框，但没有人愿意费力去改变州政府或县政府的规定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the the fear that is struck into the hearts of restaurant managers when uh someone with a hanging neck tag comes in from the city is overwhelming. the messages on Slack go immediately out and everyone springs into gear because a lot of the things that they require are not logical, don't make sense, are there for the purposes of checking some ridiculous box from 1965 that isn't applicable anymore, but no one wants to make the effort to change things with the state government or the county government.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你就好像被困住了，你知道，对于一个如此专注于逻辑和事物逻辑方法，真正推理事情并找出最佳前进方向的人来说，被置于这种毫无逻辑的境地是极其令人沮丧的。而这个人的决定很大程度上取决于他们当天的心情，或者他们是否喜欢你的地方，或者他们是否喜欢你，或者正在发生什么。这可能不是基于任何书面规定，而是更多地基于这种难以捉摸的细微差别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you just kind of get locked into, you know, for for someone who is so focused on logic and the logical approach to things and really reasoning things out and finding out the best way forward, it's just in excruciatingly frustrating to be put in this position where nothing is logical. And the decisions of this individual largely have to do with their mood that day or whether they don't whether they like your place or whether they like you or whatever is going on. it could be motivated not by anything on paper but more about this sort of unknowable nuance.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 呃，这极其令人沮丧。你知道，有一些臭名昭著的检查员让人们感到恐惧。也有一些检查员是人们所希望遇到的，你永远不知道你会遇到谁。我听说过一些故事，很多建筑公司也开始转型成为**代办人**（expediters: 专门帮助企业处理政府审批和文书工作的服务提供商）。所以他们基本上会接手你所有的文书工作和你需要做的荒谬数量的事情。

So they basically are will take all of your paperwork and the ridiculous amount of stuff that you need to do.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你付给他们一笔固定费用，他们不仅会（如果他们是建筑师）设计餐厅，还会通过城市、县和州的所有必要渠道处理所有事情，这需要花费惊人的金额。所以这是另一个堆积起来的问题，但没有人再愿意做这些了，因为它太荒谬了，简直让你发疯。我听说，除了洛杉矶以外，我没有其他经验，这里的这种基础设施是最糟糕的之一。

### 洛杉矶餐饮业的挑战与机遇

**Tracy Aloway:** Joe早些时候列举了餐厅可能倒闭的一系列原因，但我很想听听你对洛杉矶餐厅倒闭的具体原因的看法。此外，我一直想知道一件事，为什么人们仍然开餐厅？因为你总是听到说利润微薄，非常困难，竞争激烈。你基本上要把你的一生都投入到这项事业中。这听起来像是一份艰苦的工作，但新餐厅却层出不穷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Joe uh listed a bunch of reasons that a restaurant might close earlier, but I would love to get your take on what exactly is causing restaurants to go out of business in LA. And also one thing I've always wondered about, why do people still open restaurants? Because the thing you hear is always that like it's a tiny tiny margin. It's really difficult. It's really competitive. You have to basically give your entire life over to this endeavor. It sounds like a hard job, but new restaurants open all the time.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 没错。我想说，开大多数餐厅的动机都是有缺陷的。它通常基于自我、炫耀财富或试图获取**数字声望**（digital fame: 通过社交媒体等数字平台获得的知名度），以及其他一些最终会导致短暂成功后立即衰落或直接失败的因素。嗯，这就是为什么大多数餐厅在第一年就倒闭了，因为这极其困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's true. I think I'd say that the motivation to open most restaurants is a flawed motivation. It's usually based on ego or showing off cash or trying to acquire digital fame, other things that will inevitably either lead to a short burst of success followed by an immediate decline or just an immediate uh misfire. Um, and that's why most restaurants close in the first year because it's excruciatingly difficult to do this.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我认为普遍的观点是，在餐厅工作很容易。这是一种逃避更公司化生活方式的借口，但事实并非如此。它远不如公司职业那样容易管理，也远比公司职业更混乱，这使得它非常非常难以做到。但是，为了回答你的问题，与人互动、让他们开心、与款待业建立联系、以及照顾他人并给予他们每天可以做三次，但又能带给他们快乐的事情，这其中有着令人难以置信的乐趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that the general view is that working in a restaurant is easy. It's a copout from some more corporate approach to living and it's just not. It's so much less manageable. It's so much wilder than you know a more corporate career that it makes it very very hard to do. But there is, to answer your question, incredible joy in interfacing with people and making them happy and being connected to hospitality and the pleasure of taking care of people and giving them something that they get to do, you know, three times a day, but making it something that brings them joy.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你可以看到这一点，它以一种比我写和制作广告试图操纵人们购买产品时感觉更真实的方式回馈给你。这关乎那种真实的联系，我不想余生都为我所做的事情感到糟糕。我不想为此感到糟糕。我做了将近十年。我认为这为我和在这里工作的人提供了一个真实的现实，尽管做这件事面临所有挑战。我认为这些挑战之所以存在，是因为当你试图做一些真实的事情，并且脱离我们现在这种受控存在的普遍流程时，挑战总是存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can see that and that reverberates back to you in a way that feels far more authentic than it felt when I was writing and producing commercials trying to manipulate people into buying It's about that authentic connection and I don't want to have to feel bad for what I do for the rest of my life. I don't want to have to feel bad about it. And I did that for for almost a decade. And I think that this provides a a authentic reality for me and the people that work here despite all of the challenges of doing it. And I think the challenges are in place because the challenges are are always in place when you're trying to do something that's authentic and aside from the general flow of our sort of controlled existence that we have right now.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你在你的披萨店、餐厅提到了**数字声望**（digital fame: 通过社交媒体等数字平台获得的知名度）。你觉得是否有必要拥有类似**病毒式传播的龙鱼冰沙**（viral Arowana smoothie: 指通过社交媒体迅速走红的时尚餐饮产品，此处为虚拟示例）那样的东西？你认为这是否是需要考虑的重要因素，即某个产品可能会在TikTok或其他平台上爆红？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You you mentioned digital fame at your uh at the pizzeria at the restaurant. Do you feel like the need to have your equivalent of like, you know, the viral arrowan smoothie like something like is that an important thing you think about that this is a thing that could blow up on TikTok or whatever it is?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 不。不。但在这方面我很特别。我迫不及待地想让我们摆脱社交媒体。那是一种难以解决的联系。我是这样看待它的：现在餐厅和面包店已经建立起来了。一般来说，洛杉矶的人们，或者说从事食品行业的人们，或多或少都知道我们是谁。如果我此刻为我们的零售餐厅寻找新客户，那将是不真实的联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. No. But I'm I'm unique in that way. I can't wait to remove us from social media. That is a intractable connection. Here's how I think about it now. where the restaurant and the bakery are established. Generally, people in Los Angeles know to some degree or people who are involved in food know who we are. If I were to seek new customers in this moment for our retail restaurant, they would be inauthentic connections with what we do.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 他们可能会对我们刚推出的BLT三明治产生共鸣，现在夏天番茄很好吃，他们可能会在周末来餐厅，但最终我们的主要收入来源将是我们的常客，他们与餐厅建立了关系。我不想疏远他们，因为他们是会让我们在这里持续经营十年的人，而不是那些会让我们一时成名、赶走我们的常客，然后又转向下一个潮流的人。所以对我们来说，潮流是业务杀手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They might resonate with some with our BLT that we just put out first when the tomatoes are good now in the summer and they might come to the restaurant on the weekend, but ultimately our bread and butter is going to be our regular return customers who have a relationship at the restaurant and I don't want to ostracize them because they're the people who are going to keep us here for a decade as opposed to the people who are going to make us famous in the moment, drive out our regular customers and then move on to the next trendy thing. So for us, trends are are a business killer.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 你可以从潮流中获得短暂的成功，但如果你想长期经营并建立一个忠实的客户群，你必须与这些人建立真实的联系。这意味着无论你的产品是什么，他们都因为自己的愿望而真实地与之产生联系，而不是因为我通过制作一个病毒式传播的TikTok视频来强迫他们与我们的产品产生娱乐时刻。所以就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can get short short success from a trend, but if you want to be here for a long time and build a customer base that's dedicated, you have to have an authentic relationship with those people. And that has to mean that whatever your product is, they are authentically connecting with it because of their own desires, not because I'm forcing them to have an entertainment moment with our product by, you know, creating a Tik Tok video that goes viral. So that's Yeah.</p>
</details>

### 关税影响与食材选择

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，说到当下，我们正在7月8日录制这期节目，我们仍然不太清楚关税会发生什么，但我想在建设披萨店的过程中，你可能正在从各地订购设备，呃，巨大的披萨烤箱等等。你们是否受到了关税的任何影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speaking of the moment, we're recording this on July 8th and we we still don't really know what's happening with the tariffs, but I imagine in the course of building out a pizzeria, you're probably ordering equipment from various places, uh, giant pizza ovens and all that. Have you been impacted at all by the tariffs yet?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 影响很小。从我的角度来看，目前仍然非常困惑，不知道正在发生什么，或者未来会发生什么。我们当然预料到了，你知道，我们的烤箱来自德国。我们的，你知道，各种设备都来自国际各地，但我没有看到任何大的增长。我们确实有一些运费上涨。我们制作这些咖啡罐，用来盛我们烘焙的咖啡，这些罐子来自中国。我们的运费有大幅的**关税**（tariffs: 政府对进口或出口商品征收的税）上涨。这是过程的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very little. It's still very confusing from my vantage point as to what is happening or what is supposed to come down the road. And we were certainly anticipating, you know, our ovens are from Germany. Our, you know, a variety of pieces of equipment are coming from international places, but I I haven't seen any major increases. We did have some shipping increases. We make these coffee cans that we serve our roasted coffee in that come from China. there was a massive tariff increase on our shipping. That's part of the process.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 但就披萨店设备而言，我们真的没有看到。我预计可能会有10%的欧盟关税，他们说正在浮动。我只是不知道那意味着什么。以及供应商是否有预期性涨价，比如在意大利销售番茄给我们的供应商，或者在欧洲其他地方我们购买一些更昂贵食材的供应商。嗯，我们还没有看到这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in terms of, you know, the pizzeria equipment, we haven't seen it really. I'm anticipating that potentially we're talking about a 10% EU tariff, they said, floating around. I I just don't know what that means. And if there's anticipatory price increases from the vendors who are in Italy, say selling us tomatoes or who are in a variety of other places in Europe where we buy some of our more luxurious ingredients. Um we we just haven't seen those yet.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我仍然预计这是一种可能性，因为我们需要预料到这一点，我们当然正在测试加州番茄，看看是否能找到可比的。因为，你知道，**圣马尔扎诺番茄**（San Marzano tomatoes: 一种原产于意大利圣马尔扎诺地区的优质番茄，以其甜度和低酸度闻名）确实是最好的，它们也在加州生长，但只是有点不同。所以，我们正在预料需要使用加州番茄。呃，但到目前为止，我们还没有看到任何关税上涨的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am in still anticipating that as a possibility for pizza because we need to anticipate that and we are certainly testing tomatoes. California tomatoes um to see if we can find something comparable because the the you know um uh samarzanos are truly the best and they do grow in California but it's just a little bit of a different thing. So, we are anticipating the need to work with California tomatoes. Uh, but so far have not seen anything really in terms of uh uh tariffs uh increases reaching us on this side.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我只剩下最后一个问题，它又回到了洛杉矶。感觉美国主要城市总是同时在衰落和繁荣。显然，洛杉矶，你知道，你肯定在纽约和芝加哥也听到过，洛杉矶正在经历很多。有火灾，

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 最近的ICE突袭和骚乱，然后，你知道，人们，我提到，你知道，因为我刚查到的这篇文章里有提到，提醒了我，你知道，人们都在谈论好莱坞，它会成为下一个底特律吗，就那个行业被掏空而言？另一方面，它可能是全世界气候最好的地方，人们总是想住在南加州。你现在觉得在洛杉矶这座城市做生意怎么样？

How do you feel about doing business in Los Angeles right now as a city?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 极其艰难。嗯，这个城市，尤其是在食品行业，正在非常非常挣扎。嗯，在我从事这个行业以来，我从未见过如此多的餐厅倒闭，而且都是好餐厅，值得继续经营的。嗯，我认为，呃，洛杉矶之所以复杂，原因数不胜数，它的广阔，对好莱坞的依赖，作为许多人收入的主要动力或主要提供者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's excruciating. Um, this city is is uh especially in the in the food business is is very very much struggling. Um, I've never ever seen so many closures of restaurants, good ones, that deserve to be open, um, in my time, you know, let alone being a consumer, but being in the business. Um, I think that, uh, there's a an endless list of factors that make Los Angeles complicated, its expanse, the reliance on Hollywood as a major, you know, motivator for or a major provider for a large number of people in terms of income.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 随着整个市场的萎缩，你知道，你确实看到好莱坞本身的业务量大大减少。话虽如此，这是一个400平方英里的城市。你知道，我们所在的地方距离市中心大约15分钟，那里发生了一些抗议活动和很多类似的事情，但我什么也没看到。你知道，这里只是一个普通的、小小的社区体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And with that whole market shrinking, you know, you do see a a lot less b business happening in Hollywood proper. That said, it's a 400 square mile city.

You know, it's just a regular small small neighborhood experience over here.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 嗯，这些社区的行为方式非常独特。所以，当好莱坞正在萎缩并向东、向西移动时，你会看到很多发展，然后你也会看到很多关于**士绅化**（gentrification: 指一个社区因富裕居民或商业涌入而发生社会经济和文化变化的现象，常导致原住民被排挤）的抗议。你会看到很多事情，人们在这样一个非常广阔的城市里，有很多扩张和收缩。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, and you're really kind of like these neighborhoods have a very distinctly, you know, unique way of behaving. So, as Hollywood is sort of shrinking down and moving east and west, you see a lot of development and then you also see a lot of gentrification protests. You see a lot of things where folks are uh there's a lot of expansion and contraction in this really wide city.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 其中一部分令人兴奋，因为它充满活力，但它也让事情变得非常困难，因为这个城市并没有自己的身份。身份是由社区定义的。所以，当市中心和好莱坞正在收缩时，你知道，Highland Park和Glassell Park以及Glendale东部的这个区域正在扩张。Silver Lake、Echo Park和Los Feliz正在变得像曾经的好莱坞一样，吸引了更多公司业务，它们都在寻求利用这些社区的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Part of it is exciting because it's dynamic, but it's also just makes things very difficult because the city doesn't really have its own identity. The identity is defined by the neighborhood. So, as downtown and Hollywood are contracting, you know, Highland Park and Glassell Park and this area of Glendale kind of on the east side is expanding. Silverl and Echo Park and Los Filas are kind of becoming like Hollywood once was and getting a little bit more corporate businesses in there and they're all looking to capitalize on the growth of these neighborhoods.</p>

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我还得再问一个问题，为什么加州种植的**圣马尔扎诺番茄**（San Marzano tomato: 一种原产于意大利圣马尔扎诺地区的优质番茄）被认为不如意大利种植的圣马尔扎诺番茄？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I got to ask one more question, but why is a San Marzano tomato grown in California considered subpar to a San Marzano tomato grown in Italy?</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 我不会说不如。我不会说不如。气候略有不同。呃，稍微不同。所以，你最终会得到稍微不同的结果。从我们看到的情况来看，意大利的圣马尔扎诺番茄最终会更甜一点，嗯，更浓郁一点。也许这与更直接的阳光、更多的火山土壤有关。谁知道呢？有各种不同的原因导致**微气候**（microclimates: 局部地区的小气候，与周边大区域气候不同）产生略有不同的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wouldn't say subpar. I wouldn't say subpar. The climate is vaguely different. Uh, slightly different. So, you end up with a little bit different result. From what we've seen, the Samaranos from Italy end up being a little bit sweeter, um, a little bit more robust. And maybe that has to do with even more direct sunlight, more volcanic soil. Who knows? There's a variety of different different reasons why the microclimates create slightly different and results.</p>
</details>

**Andy Kaden:** 这就像葡萄酒一样。你知道，你可以在法国南部和北加州种植同样的葡萄，但由于微气候、土壤和环境的不同，最终会得到截然不同的风味。所以，呃，这可能只是我们自己的推断，但我们正在努力寻找对我们来说最好的选择。

<p class="english-text">It's in Soho. It used to be literally across the street from where I lived. Best sandwiches ever. It blew my mind the first time I went there. They've expanded since then. The uh expanded store is not so good.</p>

**Tracy Aloway:** 你知道，向我们的制作人Dash致敬，因为他不是做了那个旅行，他尝试了纽约市100个最佳三明治中的每一个吗？我们得请他来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, shout out to our producer Dash cuz didn't he like he did that tour where he like tried every one of the 100 best sandwiches in New York City. We got to get him on.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们应该采访Dash。我们应该在某个时候和Dash多做一些关于纽约市三明治的节目。

<p class="english-text">We should interview Dash. We should do a lot more with Dash at some point about New York City sandwich.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 那会很有趣。好的。但更严肃地说，有很多有趣的东西可以从中提取出来。但我想到的其中一件事，这在我们的鸡肉系列节目中也提到过，当时我们采访了司法部，那就是**中间商的暴政**（tyranny of the middleman: 指中间环节过多或中间商权力过大，导致成本增加和效率降低）这个概念，对吧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">That'd be fun. Okay. But on a more serious note, there was lots of interesting stuff to pull out from there. But one of the things I'm thinking about, and this kind of came up in our chicken series, uh, when we talked to the DOJ, but it's that idea of the tyranny of the middleman, right?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 这种想法是，好的，显然你从面粉生产商那里购买面粉，但从生产商到你手中，中间有一个分销商，它会收取加价。然后，现在你开一家新公司，你必须有一个**繁文缛节向导**（red tape sherpa: 指专门帮助企业处理复杂政府审批和文书工作的顾问或代理人）来引导你。那是另一个中间商。然后运费上涨。我的意思是，运输不一定是中间商，但它肯定是过程的中间环节。似乎成本压力主要来自那里。

<p class="english-text">And this idea that okay, obviously you're buying flour from a flower producer, but then in between the producer and it getting to you, there's the distributor which is charging a markup. And then when you're setting up a new business nowadays, you have to have like basically a red tape sherpa to walk you through. That's another middleman. And then the shipping costs going up. I mean, shipping not necessarily a middleman, but certainly the middle of the process. It seems like that's where the cost pressures are really coming in.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，我认为所有这些都非常有趣。还有这种想法，比如你可以有一个用于配送的优步，但那样你就会失去那种个人关系。

<details>

<p class="english-text">No, I I think all that's super interesting. Also, this idea that like you could have an Uber for distribution, but then you lose that</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 面包巴士。

<p class="english-text">a bread bus,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但那样你就会失去那种个人关系。如果这很重要，因为你需要从那家餐厅的厨师那里听到反馈，那么如果你不拥有配送权，你就得不到反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but then you lose that personal relationship. And if that's important because you need to hear feedback from the chef at that restaurant, then you don't get it. If you don't own the distribution,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，然后就是，你知道，洛杉矶本身，我们应该在某个时候回到洛杉矶，因为它确实，我的意思是，这是一个令人难以置信的地方，但这个城市正在发生令人难以置信的各种奇怪的事情。而且，正如你所说，在最轻松的时候开一家餐厅似乎都很疯狂。我觉得你得有点脑损伤才能做那种事。然后要在那里做，有很多非常有趣的地方。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um, and then just, you know, LA itself, we should do at some point we got to go back to LA because it does, I mean, incredible place, but incredibly number of like sort of ranching things going on in that city. And opening a restaurant, as you mentioned, sort of seems crazy in the easiest of times. Like I feel like you have to have a little bit of brain damage to do that. And then to do it in uh there's a lot there that was very interesting.</p>
