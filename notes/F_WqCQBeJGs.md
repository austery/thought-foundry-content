### 诉讼缘起

**Speaker 1**: 好的。我们来聊聊**陈光诚**起诉**王志安**的诽谤案。他不仅在推特上宣布了诉讼，还制作了一部纪录片来报道整个过程。这部视频被陈光诚本人在推特上转发了，所以如果你感兴趣，可以去看一下，它基本上记录了整个过程，解释了他为什么决定起诉王志安。诉讼的起源实际上源于王志安在2025年8月发布的一个视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: okay. let's talk about the chenguang g chung versus wong g and defamation lawsuit. he didn't just announce the lawsuit on twitter. he also commissied a documentary to report the entire process. this video has been retweeted by chenguu ang chhung on twitter, so you can watch it if you're interested it basically documents the whole process, explaining why he decided to sue wa NGE. the origin of the lawsuit actually stems ps from a video wong g, en made in august twenty twenty five.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 视频标题是“陈光诚真的瞎吗？”。它质疑他是否在装瞎，声称他的视力完全正常。这个视频引发了广泛的公众辩论。但如果你看了，你会发现视频的核心其实并不是关于他是否真的瞎。那只是一个耸人听闻的标题，整个内容围绕着他和**Fuchi**，以及他们的**慈善基金会**，他们的筹款活动以及财务缺乏透明度。此外，Fuchi拥有多处房产，陈光诚本人也买了一栋大房子，据说是全款付清的。这是我在推特上看到的，我不确定是否属实。但考虑到陈光诚的地位和他来美国的经历，如果你依赖捐款，试图用慈善的方式来资助你的基金会，因为这个基金会不仅仅是为了你自己，而是为了帮助有需要的人，对吧？你是通过某个渠道把钱洗进了自己的账户吗？这实际上是主要的争议点。它提出了这两个个人基金会的财务是否透明，以及他们的非营利组织是否受到适当的监管。它还质疑了他们在在线筹款和基金会运营期间是否考虑了这些方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: the title was is chenguu ang chchung really blind. it questioned whether he was faking, his blindness, claiming his eyesight was perfectly fine. this video sparked widespread public debate. but if you watch it, you'll realize the core of the video wasn't actually about whether he was truly blind. that was just a sensational title, the entire content revolved around him and fuchi. and there charitable foundation, their fundraising efforts and the lack of transparency in their finances. furthermore, fuchi ones, multiple properties and chenguang g chung himself also bought a large house supposedly paying for it in full. this is what i saw on twitter. i'm not sure if it's true, but given chenguangangchung status and his experience coming to the US, if you're relying on donations trying to use a charitable approach to fund your foundation, because this foundation isn't just for you. it's to help others in need, right? are you laandering the money into your own account through some channel? this is actually the main point of contention. it raises the question of whether the two individuals foundations finances are transparent, and whether there are nonprofit organization is subject to proper oversight. it also questions whether they considered these aspects during the online fundraising and operation of the foundation.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 然而，陈光诚抓住了王志安在节目中一个不精确的陈述。王志安说他不是真正意义上的盲人，这其实很容易证明，因为普通人对“盲人”的理解和医学上的定义是不同的。是的，它们是不同的。陈光诚，举个例子，你可能会觉得奇怪他戴着太阳镜。如果他是瞎子，他怎么还能在推特上发帖？因为还有他开着**Tesla**的照片。这其实是医学定义上的“盲人”和我们普遍理解的“盲人”之间的区别。我们理解的盲人是那种完全看不到任何东西的人，就像那个失明的音乐家，拄着拐杖，什么都看不见，那种刻板印象。从医学上讲，是的，情况并非如此。**低视力**基本上被认为是失明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: however, chenguang n chchn g seized a certain tain imprecise statement. wong genen made in the program that wong jian said he wasn't truly blind less than control one hundred greater than it's actually very easy to prove, because the way ordinary people understand blindness and the medical definition of blindness are different. yes, they are different chenguang GHUG. for example, you might find it strange that he wear sunglasses. if he's blind, how can he still post on twitter because there's also that photo of him driving a tesla. this is actually the difference between the medical definition of blindness. and our common understanding of it, we understand blind people as someone who can't see anything at all like obing. the blind musician who walks with a cane and can't see anything that kind of stereotypical image medically speaking. yes, that's not actually the case. low vision is essentially considered blindness.

</details>

### 争议焦点

**Speaker 2**: 你看，他发了这条消息说，12月24日，圣诞节前夕，他在**东京地方法院**提起了对王志安的诽谤诉讼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: you see, he posted this message saying that on december twenty fourth, the eve of christmas, he filed a lawsuit for defamation against wo NG shl fy in the tokyo district court in japan.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 哇，陈光诚甚至不过圣诞节。他去日本起诉王志安。你真的要在圣诞节前夕起诉某人？在日本的诉讼中，他要求赔偿3.3亿日元。你知道那相当于多少美元吗？除以100或150？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: wow, and guang ang chung doesn't even celebrate christmas. he goes to japan to sue w ong shelfi. you're really going to sususomesomeone on chrimmas eve and in his lawsuit in japan, he's demanding three hundred thirty million japanese yen in compensation. 哪个 do you know how much that is in US dollars divide by one hundred or one hundred fifty?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 大约200万美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: it's about two million US dollars.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 哇，200万美元。此案已被法院受理，审判将于东京时间2月10日在612号法庭开始。我不知道是否公开，但如果公开，那肯定应该是公开的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: wow, two million US dollars. this case has already been accepted by the court, and the trial will begin on febary tenth tokyo time in courtroom, six hundred twelve. i don't know if it's open to the public, but if it is, then it should definitely be public.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 我看到有观众说他们不同意这个说法。所以需要解释一下，陈光诚说自己是盲人的时候，其实有点操纵性。他利用了社会普遍对“盲人”的认知——即盲人什么都看不见。他利用这一点为自己谋利。然后，在起诉王志安时，他又会搬出医学上对“盲人”的定义。看起来陈光诚是在不断地在两种定义之间切换。当然，他抓住王志安的陈述不放，并以此作为攻击和起诉他的点。大家都明白其中的含义，非常清楚。因为如果你看王志安的视频，大部分质疑都是关于他基金会的内容。你为什么不反驳王志安关于基金会的说法？你不在那个战场上战斗，而是试图偷袭他。你可以看出，他的律师，他肯定咨询过律师，律师分析了如何能有很大胜算地起诉王志安，找到的点一定是在专业分析后确定的，认为起诉王志安这一点很可能获胜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: i see some viewer saying they disagree with this statement. so i need to explain changguong. chchung is actually being a bit manipulative when he says he's blind. he's taking advantage of the common societal perception of blinness. that is that blind people can't see anything at all. he's using this to his advantage, then when it comes to suing ing wong gene, he will, again pick up the medical definition of blindness. it seems changguong chchung is repeatedly switching between two definitions. of course, he's focusing on one g ans, empresise statement and using it is a point to attack him and sue him. everyone understands this v meaning behind. it is quite clear, because if you look at one genes videos, most of the questioning is about the content of his foundation. why didn't he refused? wong genes claims about the foundation? you're not fighting on that battlefield. but instead, you're trying to sneak ak attackhim, you can see that his lawyer, he must have consulted with a lawyer, and the lawyer analyzed how to suw wong gene with a high chance of winning the point he found must have been determined after analysis by professionals concluding that suing wong gene on this point would likely lead to victory.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 然而，这对我们外人来说印象非常不好。因为大家都知道你当时说自己是盲人是什么意思。你是说社会意义上的盲人还是医学意义上的盲人？你不知道自己在说什么吗？现在你用这个来起诉王志安，不断地在两个标准之间切换。这给人留下了非常糟糕的印象。所以我认为在法律层面很有可能发生一些事情。我认为你很可能会赢，因为这个点是用来攻击王志安的，这一点肯定是在他律师的仔细考虑和分析之后才选定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: however, this gives us outsiders a very bad impression, because everyone knows what you meant when you said you were blind. did you mean socially blind or medically blind? don't you know what you're saying? now you're using this to sue wa GG an repeatedly switching between two standards. this gives a very bad impression. so i think there's a good chance that something will happen on a legal level. i think you will likely win because this point is using to attack wong. genen was definitely carefully considered and analyzed by his lawyer before being chosen.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 如果你看他在视频中公布的内容，包括他的纪录片，他解释得很清楚。“王志安对我进行诽谤和污蔑，说我不是一个真正意义上的盲人，这给我造成了极大的困扰。我每次做节目或者发帖，很多人都会说你是个假盲人，你在装瞎之类的。这给我造成了极大的身心痛苦，也影响了我的经济状况。人们认为我是一个骗子。我不是。我假装是个盲人，但我实际上视力完全正常。然后我的基金会的捐款可能会受到影响。”所以，如果我是陈光诚的律师，我甚至可以注册一些假账号去批评他，说“王志安，你不是假盲人，对吧？”然后策划一场全方位的自导自演。所以，我认为经过仔细分析，他胜诉的可能性更高，胜诉的概率应该在百分之六十以上，甚至百分之七十。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: if you look at what he announced in the video, including his documentary, he explains it very clearly. wong genans slandder and defamation against me saying, i'm not a truly blind person has caused me great trouble. every time i do a show or post something, a lot of people say you're a fake blind person, you're faking it or something like that. this has caused me great physical and mental distress. and it has also affected my financial situation. people think i'm a pn z frauster. right? no, i'm not. i'm pretending to be a blind person, but i can actually see perfectly fine. and then my foundation's donations might be affected. so this, if i were lawyer chenguu ang c hang, i could even register some fake accounts to criticize him, saying, wong, you're not a fake blind person, are you? and then orchestraate a whole self directed performance, right? so comma, i think after careful analysis that he has a higher probability of winning, the probability of him winning should be over sixty percent, maybe even seventy percent.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 因为如果你看他在视频中的策略，他没有卷入任何政治立场辩论，而是专注于事实的歪曲。这实际上是言论自由的价值保护和可验证的事实陈述之间的区别。你可以说，“王志安，你说我不是盲人。这是一个事实错误。你通过这种宣传给我造成的麻烦，我要告你。”“引用。”“是的，没错。”所以，这一点确实会让人觉得很麻烦。你肯定会……是的，很有可能发生这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: because if you look at his strategy in the video, he didn't get involved in any political stance debates, but instead focused on factual misrepresentations. this is actually the difference between the value of freedom of speech, protection and verifiable factual statements. you can say, wong, you said, i'm not blind. this is a factual error. the trouble you cause me through this propaganda. i'm going to sue you for it. quote, yes, that's right. so this is one probably finds this quite troubsome. you'll definitely have to. yes, there's a high probability that this will happen.

</details>

### 法律分析

**Speaker 1**: 有观众问，在美国，对公众人物的言论自由是不是更宽松？比如你可以侮辱总统之类的。让我解释一下，在美国，对于公众人物，你必须证明他们是“实际恶意”（actual malice）作出的。但我怀疑日本是否有类似的条款。例如，在美国，如果我称特朗普总统为猴子，特朗普总统想告我，他必须证明我有“实际恶意”，对吧？你怎么能证明我在想什么？你怎么能证明这太难了？所以，如果我侮辱公众人物，如果我侮辱总统，我基本上不会惹上麻烦。但在日本不一定如此。日本可能没有这个条款。所以我们应该知道，这涉及到价值判断和事实陈述的区别。如果我们讨论的是某人是否是盲人，这是可以通过医学验证的。在这方面，我认为如果王志安在这个节目中，如果法庭能呈现出一系列非常完整的证据，那么如果被视为一个客观的事实陈述，它就不受言论自由的保护。所以确实有一个点可以攻击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: some viewers asked in the us is the freedom of speech more relaxed regarding public figures, like you can insult the president and so on. let me explain in the us for public fifires res. you have to prove that they acwith with tutumalice. but i doubt if japan has a similar clause, for example, in the US, if i call president trumping monkey and president trump wants to sue me, he has to prove that i had actual malstwds, right? how can you prove what i'm thinking in my head? how can you prove that it's too difficult? so if i insult a public figure, if i insult the president, i basically wonget into trouble, but it's not necessarily the case in japan. japan may not have this cloass. so we should know that this involves the difference between value judgments and factual statements. if we're talking about a certain whether someone is blind or not, that can be verified medically in this respect, i think that if walms on in this program, if the plint of could present ent this as a very complechachain of evidence, then if consisired an an jejetive statement of fact, it's not protected by freedom of speech.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 这里有一个点，如果当时王志安说陈光诚在社会意义上不是盲人，那会好得多。没错。在一个节目中，他还说他咨询了医生，而且没有高烧损害视力的临床记录。所以你可以说，从证明某事是虚假的角度来看，王志安的节目不够严谨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: so there's indeed of point he can attack. there's a point here if wm zon had said at the time that chenguang chchung wasn't blind in the social sense that would have been much better. that's right in a program. he also said that he consult a doctors, and there there are no clical ical records of high fever, damaging eyeght. so you can say that wone juice program wasn't rigorous enough from the perspective of proving something false.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 你做得不对。你不能用这种方式证明它是假的。你不能用这种方法证明它是假的，对吧？即使你自己没听说过。所以不代表它不存在。而且，如果对方能提供一些证据，比如反驳医学事实，证明山东发生过类似事件，有大量的权威医学文献和知识，你的论点不就站不住脚了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: you're doing it wrong. you can't prove it false this way. you can't use this method to prove it false, right? even if you haven't heard of it yourself. so doesn't mean it doesn't exist. moreover, the other party can easily disprove your claim if you could present some evident, such as refuding medical facts, proving that similar incidents did happen in shanddoong with a lot of authority, tive medical literature and knowledge. wouldn't your argument be untennble?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 对。是的，天哪。所以这样证明某事是假的，是不可接受的。我认为如果他说他不是社会意义上的盲人，我们理解的那种他可以开车做其他事情，那不就足够了吗？那会达到同样的效果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: right? yes, god, so proving something false. this way is not acceptable. i think if he had said that he wasn't blind in the sociological sense that we understand that he could drive a car and do other things wouldn't have been enououright that would have achieved the same effect,

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 然后王志安用报道来起诉，然后有人做了一个视频，说陈光诚喜欢摄影，然后他质疑一个盲人怎么能拍照，对吧？这其实是一个误解，因为这些技术现在已经非常成熟了。你可以使用声音、触摸和其他技术辅助进行摄影。我在评论区看到有人说，他本人其实是盲人，但他使用苹果手机完全没有困难。这表明技术已经成熟到你可以很好地与互联网互动。所以他拍照的事实并不能证明他不是盲人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: then walm zon use used reporore susui, then one sube who made a hideo, saying that chenguong chchunang likes photography, then he question how a blind person could take pictures, right? this is actually a misconception, because these technologies are now very mature. you can use sound touch and other technological aids for photography. i saw someone in the comments section saying that uh, he himself is actually blind, but he use an apple phone completely without any difficulty. this shows that technology has mature to a point where you can interact with the internet very well, right? so the fact that he takes pictures doesn't prove that he's not blind.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 然而，我在这里贴一张图。这是陈光诚发的一条推文。我不会在这里播放视频，因为它非常不适合工作（NSFW），但你可以看到，当他在推特上发布这些东西时，他是一个非常极端的特朗普支持者。如果你关注他的推特，你会知道这一点非常清楚。他可能比埃隆·马斯克更支持特朗普。他支持特朗普到了有点过度的地步。所以很多人感到困惑。你不是盲人吗？你怎么还能在推特上发帖，参与在线争论？提问。马克，非常激烈的在线争论。怎么回事？关闭。这实际上是许多网民的疑问点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: however, i'm going to post a picture here. this is a tweet that chenguang ang chhgg posted. i won't play the video here because it's very much NSFW not safe for work, but you can see that when he posts these things on twitter, he's a very extreme trump supporter. if you followed his twitter, you'll know that is very clear about this. he's probably even more supportive of trump than elon musk. he's so supportive of trump that it's a bit much. so many people are puzzled. aren't you blind? how can you still post on twitter engaging in online arguments right question? mark, very aggressive online arguments. what's going on? close. this is actually a point of doubt for many netizines.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 第三点是这张特斯拉的照片。这张特斯拉的照片实际上是一个梗。他说：“今天，我和朋友一起试驾了一辆特斯拉电动汽车。感觉很棒。它可以在两秒内加速到120公里/小时。”引用。有一张他坐在驾驶座上的照片。有些人会想，你是瞎子，盲人能开车吗？这很难理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: the third point is this tesla picture. this tesla picture is actually a mean here. he says, today. i went a test drive a tesla electric car with a friend. it felt great. it can accelerate to one hundred, twenty kilometers per hour in two seconds. quote. there's a picture of him sitting in the driver's seat. some people will wonder you're blind, can blind people even drive find this very difficfict t to understdone.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 有人也说，我转发了这条帖子后，你听不懂中文吗？他说他试驾了特斯拉，但你不知道。引用陈光诚在另一条推文中，他站在特斯拉前说：“如果你要买车，就买特斯拉，我是一个非常自豪的特斯拉车主”，然后炫耀了他的特斯拉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: someone also said, after i reposted this post, don't you understand chinese? he said he test sts drove a tesla, but you don't know it. quote cheng u. ang gchung in another post stood in front of a tesla and said, if you're buying a car buy a tesla, i'm a very proud tesla owner and then showed off his tesla.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 你可以看到他确实买了一辆，对吧？好的。所以他说，这些AI识别技术可以帮助他在推特上进行在线争论，包括陈光诚甚至评论了推特上泛滥的黄色推文（色情内容）。我没太注意，但你可以看到陈光诚教授的兴趣广泛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: you can see that he actually bought one right okdud. so he's saying that these AI identification technologies can help him engage in online arguments on twitter, including that chenguang chchung, even commented on the rampant yellow tweets sexually explicit content on twitter. i didn't pay attention to that, but you can see that professor changguangchung has a wide range of interests.

</details>

**Speaker 0**: 我是我个，这是这是是的，这的这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 0]**: 我是我个，
[Speaker 0]: 这是这是是的，
[Speaker 0]: 这的这个。

</details>

### 策略与动机

**Speaker 1**: 然后还有其他指控，比如王志安的视频不仅仅是为了娱乐，对吧？他剪掉了陈光诚吸鼻子的片段，并在关键部分反复播放。我也听到了，我觉得很有趣，但这样做真的不太道德。你不是想羞辱他吗？他只吸了一次鼻子，却让人们觉得他每隔几秒钟都在吸鼻子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: and then there are other accusations like wong juws video wasn't just for entertainment, right? he edited out the clip of chengguang ang chung sniffing his nose and repeatedly played at the crucial part. i heard it too, and i thought it was quite funcey, but it's really not very ethical by doing that. aren't you just trying to humiliate him? he only snifed once, but made it seem like he was was ninifing every few seconds.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的，王志安这种被动攻击行为尤其明显。他有一种无法控制的讽刺冲动。有强迫性的攻击性，这家伙在制造戏剧性方面确实有一套。解释，马克，这种戏剧性确实是他的风格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes, this psive aggressive behavior from wong jew is particularly noticeable. he has an uncontrollable urge to be sarcastic. comppsive aggressive this one due is really something when it comes to creating drama explanation, mark, this kind of drama indeed his style.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 然后还有另一条推文，陈光诚的原意应该是一个随意的笑声，但王志安在节目中将其翻译为“淫荡的笑声”。这可能也不准确。然而，陈光诚也经常攻击哈里斯，利用她的私生活。如果你搜索他的推特，你会看到很多这样的内容。实际上，双方对此都没有太多可说的，王志安可能也没有精确引用那条推文。但我认为王志安对陈光诚意思的整体表达是准确的。陈光诚确实在推特上积极攻击哈里斯，说她私生活有问题等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: then there's another tweet where chent one chg's original, meaning should have been a casual laugh, but one and translated it as a ude with civivious laugh in the program. this might also be inaccurate. however, chenguu NCANG also frequently attacked harris using her private life. if you search as twitter, you'll see a lot of this, actually neither side has much to say about this one and might not have quoted that tweet precisely. but i think wes overall expression of chenguangchchg's meaning is accurate. chenguang chchungg was indeed aggsively attacking harris on twitter, saying that she had problems with her private life and various other things.

</details>

**Speaker 0**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 0]**: 嗯，

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 所以这场诉讼现在非常清楚了。一方面，他说他想保护自己的声誉，然后他希望作者付出法律代价，阻止类似行为再次发生，并为**言论自由**和责任的界限设定标准。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: so this lawsuit is now very clear. on the one hand, he's saying that he wants to protect his reputation, and then he wants the author to pay the legal price, prevents similar behavior from happening again, and set a standard for the boundaries of freedom of speech and responsibility. right?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的。实际上，大家都知道他为什么起诉王志安，因为在王志安的视频中，他非常清楚地表明，争议点在于陈光诚基金会的问题。是的，他的收入来源被切断了，说他是盲人只是为了吸引观众的点击。但如果你看了那一集，你就知道他基本上是在谈论他的基金会为什么不透明以及是否存在财务问题。他没有用这些理由来反诉王志安。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes, actually everyone knows why he's suing wong GM because in one g, ms. video, he made it very clear that the point of contention is the problems with chenguang gchang's foundation. yes, his source of income was cut off saying, he's a blind man is just click way to attrtract viewers. but if you watch that episode, you know he was basically talking about why his foundation is in transparent and whether there are financial problems, he didn't use these reasons to counter suu wan.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 我认为他计算得很仔细。一方面，如果你真的从这个角度起诉网站，那么律师可以进行“证据开示”（discovery process），一个探索证据的过程，对吧？双方律师必须交换证据，然后陈光诚将不得不向王志安的律师提交他基金会的所有财务记录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: and i think he's calculated this very carefully. on the one hand, if you really sue the website from this perspective, then the lawyers can conduct a discovery process, a process of exploring evidence, right? the lawyers from both sides have to exchange evidence, then cheng UAGCANG would have to hand over all the financial records of his foundation to wong genans lawyer.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 他肯定承受不了。如果有猫腻，不就暴露了吗？对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: he definitely can't bear that if there's something fishy, wouldn't you be exposed, right?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 所以你看，在王志安的长篇视频节目中，陈光诚只抓住了“他不是真正的人”这一点来起诉他。这背后有很大的原因。他非常狡猾，非常狡猾。你可以看到当时王志安已经发了什么。他说，王志安的节目播出后一小时，有人建议陈光诚和他的妻子起诉他去日本。陈光诚的律师迅速转发并评论了。你可以看到这是非常讽刺的。他迅速转发。他说，我们的节目基于快速获得的信息，符合媒体对公众基金会和公众人物的报道原则。我不怕任何诉讼，无论是否与海洋产业有关，我都会认真对待。所有诉讼都是对方的合法权利。但我想提醒你，涉及使用公共资金的诉讼的诉讼费用不应由基金会的捐款承担。引用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: so that's why you can see that in vane's very long video program chen only seized on the point that he's not a real person to sue him. there's a big reason for that. he's quite cuning very cunning. you can see that one had already posted something at the time. he said that an hour afwane's program aired someone suggested that chent wongchung and his wife seow him japan, the blblind chchwongg's lawyer quickly side and reposted it. you can see that this jauan is very sarcastic. he quickly side. he. he said that our program based on quickly available information and complies with media reporting principles for public foundations and public figures. i'm not afraid of any lawsuits, whether it's related to the marine industry or not, i will take it seriously. all lawsuits are the legal rights of the other party. but i would like to remind you that the litigation costs for lawsuits concerning the use of public funds should not be born by the foundations. donations. quote,

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 哦，是的。是的。所以现在这种情况，诉讼已经开始了。我认为王志安可以做很多事情。最坏的情况下，他可以把战场转移到美国，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: oh, dut, yes. yes, dut. so now this situation, the lawsuit has already begun. i think one can do a lot of things at worst. he can just bring the fight to the us, right?

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 在美国起诉陈光诚。你试图用这场恶意的诉讼侵犯我的言论自由权。你想让我闭嘴，对吧？你想阻止独立媒体质疑你的基金会。你是想用这场卑鄙的诉讼来恐吓我吗？这不就是你的目的吗？嗯，而且你还……我可以说你违反了言论自由的规则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: suing changguang ang chung g in the us. and you're trying to use this moitious lawsuit to infringe upon my freedom of speech rights. you want to silence me, right? you want to stop independent media from questioning your fund. are you using this despicable lawsuit to intimidate me? isn't that your purpose? well, also you back, i'll say viviolted the rules of freedom of speech.

</details>

**Speaker 0**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 0]**: 嗯。

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 我告诉你，他可以直接制作一个节目，说“陈光诚，你的基金会被滥用了，你挪用了资金。我们将成立一个调查组，聘请专业的美国调查记者来调查这个问题。”我看到了。华盛顿邮报有多少人被解雇了？他们解雇了杰夫·贝索斯，雇佣其中几个人作为承包商来做这个项目，来处理这个案子，彻底调查陈光诚的基金会。你觉得他能承受住吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: and let me tell you he could directly produce a program, saying, chan GANCHANG is your und being misused sed, you mised appropriating the money money 'll set up an investigation team and higher professional american investigative journalists to investigate this quonow. i see that. so many people at the washington posts were fired. weren't they? they fired? jeff ff zos well hire a few of them as contractors to work on this project to work on this case, investigate chengguangchun's fun thoroughly. what do you thinking withstand that?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的，他可以采取很多对策。所以我认为陈光诚的举动实际上非常愚蠢，因为他在这件事上……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes, many countermeasures he can take. so i think chenguangchchg's actions are actually very foolish because he's not in writing this matter,

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 如果他积极回应关于他基金会的问题，说：“关于王志安的指控，我将公开披露每一笔捐款的使用细节。信息都是公开的，没有问题。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: if he were to respond positively to the questions about his foundation, saying, regarding wong unge's accusations, i will publicly disclose all the details of how every donation was used. the information is all public, there's no problem.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 那么王志安的指控就会被驳斥。然后在此基础上，我可以告诉你，“你说我帮助别人给我造成了很大的麻烦。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: then one on ge's accusations would be disprove them. and then on that basis, i can say you said, i caused you great trouble by helping someone.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 那么我认为，一方面，你可以在公众舆论中占据道德高地。另一方面，你会很好地打赢这场仗。现在他拒绝谈论针对他的诉讼或与这些诉讼相关的问题。他也拒绝披露基金会的混乱账目，但他却先去了日本起诉王志安，在公众舆论的法庭上。你认为陈光诚显然是为了报复，因为有人质疑他吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: then i think on the one hand, you can stand on the moral high ground in public opinion. on the other hand, you'll fight this battle very well. now he refuses to talk about the lawsuits against him or the issues related to these lawsuits. he also refuses to disclose the messy accounts of this foundation, but he goes to japan to zoowomzon first in the court of public opinion. do you think chen is clearly doing this for revenge because someone question him?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的，这很有分裂性。实际上，我看了那一集节目，王志安也提到了。具体来说，他说乔·弗兹奥先生的基金会相当正规，账目非常清晰。所以如果有人想捐款，就捐给乔·弗兹奥先生的基金会，因为它能够经受住王志安的审查。所以它肯定有一定的可信度。但我看到乔·弗兹奥的基金会发推支持陈光诚反对王志安。是的，他本人相对干净，但他肯定对王志安不满，因为乔·弗兹奥和什么样的人交往？你知道的，对吧？当然，他自己的正直，以及他站在哪一边，都会带来很多麻烦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes, this is quite devisive. actually, i watch that episode of the show where wong jew also mentioned it. specifically, he said that mister joe funzeo's foundation is quite legitimate with very clear accounts in everything. so if anyone wants to donate because it donate to mister joe fzeos foundation, because it was able to withstand one ze's foundation. so it definitely has some credibility, but i saw that joe funzos founpoted shandwangong post on twitter supporting shandguangong against wzong. yes, he himself is relatively clean, but he is definitely to satisfied with wongin because what kind of people does joe phone associate with, you know that right, of course, his own integrity, and which side he takes are much trouble.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的，是的，没错。所以你看，王志安惹了这么多麻烦。我认为陈光诚低估了王志安的力量。王志安当时做了什么？他去了美国起诉陈光诚。他不仅如此，他还经历了美国司法系统的整个法律程序。他非常了解这个系统。我预测，我预测王志安可能会……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes, yes, that's right. so you see wm zon consir up so much trouble. and i think chandguong g chung underestimated warong zon's power. what did wangzong do back then? iran to the united states to fang shimmman. he not only that, but he went through the entire legal process in the american judicial system. he knows the system very well. i predict i predict that one might police sh ununt,

</details>

### 反击与舆论

**Speaker 2**: 比如在美国直接起诉陈光诚，甚至去美国拍纪录片。我认为这肯定会导致直接对抗。实际上，如果你组织一个集体诉讼，考虑到你的基金会存在大量问题，王志安可以以此大做文章，在美国组织一群人提起集体诉讼，那将非常有前景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: like directly filing accountersuit in the united states against chingguang ang chung and even flying to the US to filmer documentary. i think this could definitely lead to a direct confrontation. actually, if you organizes a class action lawsuit, considering the numerous problems with your five zero, one c, three charities counts, II wong,

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 还有一件事我想说，陈光诚要求200万美元的赔偿是荒谬的。你有什么理由要求这么多钱？我觉得他的意图更多是制造大新闻，而不是严肃地要求赔偿。而且在日本的法律史上，没有先例支持如此高的金额。这是不可能的。你获得如此高额赔偿的可能性几乎为零。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: you could make a show out of it and rarely a group of people in the united states to file a class action lawsuit that would be quite promising. and one more thing i wanted to say is that chenwung chged demand for two million dollars and compensation is outrageous. what reason you have to demand so much money? i feel like the intention is more about creating a big news story rather than a serious demand for compensation. and in japanese legal history, there are no president supporting such a high amount. it's impossible. the probability of you getting such a large amount in compensation is almost zero.

</details>

### 法律判决预测

**Speaker 1**: 嗯，我认为王志安很可能在“盲人”问题上的诉讼中败诉。我认为他可能不会在这个问题上花费太多精力辩护。他可以付一些钱，对吧？陈光诚可能会发布一个奇怪的道歉视频之类的，然后支付一两万美元的赔偿。我认为最多也就两万美元。是的，在日本有先例，类似案件的赔偿金额为4万美元。陈光诚在这件事上可以做很多其他事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: well. i think wong jian is very likely to lose the lawsuit regarding the blind people issue. i think he might choose not to spend too much energy defending himself on this point. he can just pay some money, right? chenguu ang GH ung might release some bizarre apology video or something, and then pay one or two tens of thousands of dollars in compensation. i think almost at most twenty thousand US dollars. yes, there are precedents in japan, where similar cases resulted in compensation of forty thousand US dollars. he can do so many other things chenguguang gchung in this matter.

</details>

**Speaker 2**: 你可能会赢得诉讼，但输掉公众舆论。我认为这很有可能发生。所以让我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: you might win the lawsuit, but lose the public opinion. i think this is highly likely to happen. so let's wait and see.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 我不知道是否有人有其他意见。我认为王志安很可能会把这场战斗带到美国。然而，一些观众可能已经查过了。他们说在日本，虽然诽谤定罪很严格，但如果传播的事实是为了公共利益，仅仅是为了维护公共福祉并被证明是真实的，那么它就不构成诽谤。这似乎是一个相当棘手的法律点。确实是为了公共利益，但区分社会意义上的盲人和医学意义上的盲人之间存在细微差别。所以我们会看到法院如何裁决。但我倾向于认为赔偿金额不会很高，可能在几万美元的范围内。如果你看日本类似的案件，诽谤的赔偿金额通常在100万到300万日元之间，最多。所以我想这就是目前的情况。有兴趣的人可以进一步关注和研究，但关于陈光诚与王志安的这场战斗的讨论才刚刚开始。我们稍后会继续跟进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: i don't know if anyone has other opinions, i think one gene is very likely to bring this battle to the united states. however, some viewers might have checked. and they said that in japan, while defamation convictions are strict, there is an exception if the facts you spread in the public interest, only for maintaining public welfare and proven to be true, then it is not constitute defamation. this seems to be a rather tricky. legal point is indeed for the public interest, but there is a slight mistake in distinguishing between blind people in a sociological sense, and in a medical sense. so we'll see the court rules. but i also tend to think that the compensation won't be very high, probably in the tens of thousands of US dollars range. if you look at similar cases in japan, the compensation amount for defamation generally ranges from one million to three million japanesian have most at most. so i think this is the current situation. those were interested can follow up and research further, but this discussion about chen gua n chhg's battle with wong gene has just begun. we will continue to follow up later.

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 好的。那么我们应该快点结束，进入今天的下一个环节了吗？看起来有点……我们尽量控制时间。好的，等等，让我停一下。我的屏幕卡住了。劳埃。你玩电子游戏吗？哦，天哪，我很久没玩了。但既然春节快到了，我应该开始创作了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: okay. so should we wrap up soon and move onto the next segment today? seems a little, let's try to control the time. okay, wait, let me stop for a moment. my screen is lagging. laoue. do you play video games? oh, dear, it's been a while since i've played this. but since the spring festival is coming up, i should start composing again, right?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的。所以我刚才和你讨论是因为今天Zuro提到他家里发生了一些奇怪的事情。我说，好的，那我暂时顶替一下。但如果Zuro下周能来，我得请假去完成这个作品。你是要用AI来作曲吗？还是怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes. so i was just discussing this with you because today zuro mention that something rather strange happen at his house. i said, okay, then i'll fill in in for tetemporily. but but if zuro can come next week, i'll have to take some time off to finish this piece. are you going to use AII for composing? or how are you going to do it?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 是的。我肯定会继续像上次一样组建一个AI团队，让AI和合唱团演唱。啊，好的。是的。但写作部分肯定要我自己一个人写。目前，AI在作曲方面确实离标准还很远，但在演唱方面，无论是主唱还是合唱，我认为AI歌手已经非常好了，非常、非常好、非常专业。我看了王志安的节目，基本上结尾也使用了类似的技术。是的，对吧？Duck和Wang JW很早就开始使用AI来配音、跳跃等等。做得很好。他现在可以回来了，他现在可以回来了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: yes. i'll definitely continue to create an AI team like last time and have the AI and the chorst sing h. ah okay, yes, but the writing part will definitely have to be done by me writing each part individually. currently. AI is indeed quite far from the standard in the composition aspect, but in terms of singing, whether it's lead vocals or chorus, i think the AI singers are already very good, very, very good, very professional. i watched one juice program, and basically the ending also uses similar technology. yes, right? duck and one jw has long been using AI to dub sheet jumping and various other things. right? shelw wn g did a good job. he can come back now, he can come back now, right?

</details>

**Speaker 1**: 联合阵线工作部的朋友们在向你表达他们的关切。好的，那么我们控制一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 1]**: the comrades from the united front work department are showing you their kind concern. okay, let's then control one one hundred of them.
