### 警务腐败与‘南线计划’

**主持人**: 我们在此宣布一项关于一项长期调查的公告，该调查涉及有组织犯罪和警务腐败。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We are here to make an announcement regarding a lengthy investigation into organised crime and police corruption.

</details>

**主持人**: 本月早些时候，多伦多和约克地区警长们投下了一枚重磅炸弹。七名多伦多警官和一名退休警官被捕，这被描述为该部门面临的最大腐败案件之一。这项名为‘**南线计划**’(Project South)的调查始于一名资深警官据称向一名被指控的毒贩泄露了一名狱警的家庭住址，警方称这导致了一次**未遂暗杀**。当当局对此进行调查时，他们发现了更多涉及枪支、毒品、贿赂和妨碍司法公正等方面的指控。现在，该省的警务总监已下令对安大略省的警务部门和委员会进行全省审查。那么，警官们究竟被指控了什么？接下来会发生什么？并且，从更宏观的角度看，这样的丑闻会对公众信任造成什么影响？我们将查看一份根据公众对其公共部门腐败程度的看法对各国进行排名的指数，并找出加拿大的排名及原因。欢迎收听 The Rundown。‘南线计划’已导致多名多伦多警官被刑事起诉，并牵涉有组织犯罪。那么，到目前为止我们知道了什么？《多伦多星报》的犯罪记者詹妮弗·帕利亚罗(Jennifer Pagliaro)一直在密切关注此案。她现在在演播室与我汇合。你好吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Earlier this month, police chiefs from Toronto and York region dropped a bombshell. Seven Toronto police officers and one retired cop had been arrested in what is being described as one of the biggest corruption cases the service has ever faced. The investigation, called **Project South**, started when a veteran officer allegedly leaked the home address of a corrections officer to an accused drug trafficker, police say that led to an **attempted hit**. When authorities looked into that, they uncovered more a whole lot more allegations involving guns, drugs, bribery and obstruction of justice, among other things. Now, the province's inspector general of policing has ordered an Ontario wide review of police services and boards. So what exactly have officers been accused of and what happens next? And zooming out, what does a scandal like this do to public trust? We check out an index that lists countries according to how corrupt their public sectors are perceived to be, and find out where Canada ranks and why. Welcome to The Rundown. Project South has led to criminal charges against multiple Toronto police officers and allegations of involvement with organised crime. So what do we know so far? Jennifer Pagliaro is the Toronto Star's crime reporter and has been following this story closely. And she joins me in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 很好。非常感谢邀请我。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Good. Thanks so much for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里有很多需要挖掘的内容。我们正在了解更多关于涉案警官和平民的信息。请给我们最新的情况。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: There is a lot to uncover here. We are learning a bit more about the officers and the civilians involved. Give us the latest.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 我们刚刚报道说，一些警官涉及更详细的指控，警方称其中一名警官与一名同样作为该项目一部分被起诉的平民有关联，帮助她就如何在另一名女子的汽车上安装GPS追踪器提供建议。据称，这损坏了她的汽车，而这名女子在使用追踪器被跟踪时也感到受到骚扰。最终，警方称她担心自己的安全。现在，一名多伦多警官与一名平民一起被指控犯有该项指控，我认为这让很多人感到震惊。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: So we just reported that some of the officers were involved in a little bit more detailed allegations from the police that they, one of them was involved with a civilian who's also charged as part of this project, helping advise her on how to install a GPS tracker on another woman's car. It allegedly damaged her car, and that woman also felt harassed when she was followed using this tracker. And ultimately, police say she feared for her safety. Now, a Toronto police officer is charged jointly with a civilian in that allegation, which is, I think, shocking to a lot of people.

</details>

**主持人**: 我……如果我没记错的话，是不是还发现了一把枪？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And I'm. Correct me if I'm wrong. Was there a gun also found as well?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。这名平民拥有一支非常老式的枪，据称她将其存放在住所一个未上锁的抽屉里的一个信封里，她因此被指控疏忽保管。我们不确定她是如何得到这支枪的。如果警官以任何方式帮助了她。他并没有因此被起诉，但这当然仍然令人担忧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yes. The civilian had a very old model gun that she was allegedly keeping in a unlocked drawer inside of an envelope in her residence, which she was charged with carelessly storing. We're not sure how she got the gun. If the officer participated in helping her in any way. He's not charged with that, but of course, concerning nonetheless.

</details>

**主持人**: 还有另一名警官，与保险欺诈或汽车有关的事情。我们知道些什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And there was another officer, something closely related to insurance fraud or something with a car. What do we know?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的，有一名警官据称向他的一个同伙出谋划策，如何帮助他偷走那辆车，以便那个人可以对被盗车辆进行非法保险欺诈，这基本上是一个设局。我们知道，在法庭记录上留下名字的那个人，我们也知道他曾是**皮尔地区警局**（Peel Region police）的一名警官，已被停职但未被刑事起诉。没有人证实他们是同一个人。但当然，这个名字现在已经出现在法庭记录上，而此人据称从未进行过盗窃保险欺诈的计划。所以，这就是为什么此人没有被刑事起诉的原因。但涉案警官，**罗伯特·布莱克警长**（Sergeant Robert Black），被指控教唆他进行保险欺诈。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, there's an officer who allegedly counselled one of his associates on how he could help have that car stolen so that that person could claim an illegal insurance fraud on the stolen car, which would have been a setup, essentially. We know that the person whose name is on that court record, that name is also known to us as being one of the Peel Region police officers who is suspended but not criminally charged. No one would confirm that they're the same person. But of course, that name has popped up now on the court record, and that person allegedly never went through with the stealing insurance fraud scheme. And so that's why that person's not criminally charged. But the officer involved, Sergeant Robert Black, is charged with counselling him on how to commit insurance fraud.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们刚才评论说，感觉就像一个洋葱，我们正在一层层地剥开它。事情很复杂。我想退一步，确保我们目前掌握了所有细节。有多少警官被起诉？如果可以的话，请给我们一些更严重的指控和一些较轻的指控。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We were making the comment that it feels like this is an onion just being, you know, we're peeling and seeing the layers. There's a lot to it. I want to take a step back just to kind of make sure we have all of the details here at the moment. How many officers have been charged and with what if you can give us sort of some of the more extreme charges versus some of the lesser ones?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。所以，有七名在职的**多伦多警官**被起诉，还有一名退休警官。有趣的是，他和他的儿子是此案的共同被告。他的儿子在警队工作大约四年，他们被指控犯有一系列罪行。一些更严重的指控是，警官们本身就被指控**贩毒**，而不仅仅是协助犯罪活动，还包括**收受贿赂**以及搜索警方数据库，基本上是将这些机密数据库中的个人信息泄露给已知的涉嫌罪犯，然后由他们传播。我们知道，这已导致一系列犯罪，包括**密谋杀害**一名多伦多监狱官员以及在**GTA**（大**多伦多**地区）的多个住宅进行枪击。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So seven active duty Toronto police officers were charged, as well as one retired police officer. The interesting bit there is he and his son are co-accused in this case. His son only has around four years on the force and they're charged with a host of things. Some of the more serious charges is the officers are actually charged themselves in **trafficking drugs**, not just in aiding in that criminal activity, as well as **accepting bribes** and searching police databases, essentially leaking personal information that's on these confidential databases to known alleged criminals who were then disseminating it. And we know that that has led to a series of crimes, including **conspiracy to commit a murder** against a Toronto jail official and also a shooting various homes through the GTA.

</details>

**主持人**: 公平地说，密谋杀人是名单上最严重的指控。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Fair to say the conspiracy to commit murder. The most serious charge on that list.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: It is.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。你刚才提到了皮尔警局。有三名警官被停职，但未被刑事起诉。我们知道关于这方面的情况吗？这是否会发展成什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. The now we do. You had mentioned Peel police as well. Three officers who have been suspended, not criminally charged. Do we know anything on that if that's going to turn into anything?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。嗯，最近我们得到了一些线索，就是那个名字，我们看到可能与保险欺诈有关。我们不太清楚这些其他警官据称做了什么，或者他们目前是否只是受到怀疑并被停职等待调查。我们只知道他们没有被刑事起诉，而且我们不确定他们是否会构成刑事起诉，但我们正在密切关注。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. Well, we got a bit of a clue recently with that name that we saw that may have been involved in the insurance fraud. We don't know too much about what these other officers are alleged to have done, or whether they're just under suspicion at this time and have been suspended pending investigation. We just know that they don't have criminal charges, and we're not sure if they will warrant criminal charges, but we're watching that very closely.

</details>

**主持人**: 在警区方面，能说一下数字吗？显然，对于很多审查者来说，他们可能不知道这些地方在哪里，但能否给出一个大致的描述？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In terms of the precincts, throw out some numbers. Obviously, for a lot of reviewers, they probably won't know where they are, but just a general description of where where they are.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。所以，这些警官中的大多数，在职警官被分配到城市西北部的一些区域。比如在**Black Creek**和**North York**地区，有一名警官被分配到一个市中心核心区域的部门。我们知道一些警官在同一个部门工作，**12号部门**，就在Black Creek地区。所以我们还在拼凑这些警官是如何可能认识彼此的。过去，例如，我们曾发现一些警官，他们加起来有19年的警龄，可能一起从警校毕业。他们职业生涯早期也在12号部门一起工作过。所以也许这些关系得以维持。我们仍在努力理解这些指控是什么，以及从大局来看，这个阴谋是什么。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So most of these officers, the active officers were assigned to divisions in sort of the northwest part of the city. So in the Black Creek North York areas, there was one officer assigned to a down like a right downtown core division. We know that some of the officers were working at the same divisions, 12 division that's in that Black Creek area. So we're still piecing together how all of the officers may have known one another or came to know one another. In the past, for example, we've been able to figure out that some of the officers who have all been sort of 19 years of service between them, may have graduated from police college together. And they also worked at 12 Division together early in their careers. So perhaps those relationships were maintained. We're still trying to understand what those allegations are and what the conspiracy is on at a big picture level.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我想谈谈一位最初引起关注的警官，**蒂姆·巴恩哈特警官**（Constable Tim Barnhart）。他是谁？我们了解到了更多关于他的什么信息？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. I want to talk about one constable whose name really surfaced in the beginning, Constable Tim Barnhart. Who is he? What have we learning more of?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的。他是12号部门的警官之一。他在警队工作了19年。他一直是一名警长，这意味着通常在一个部门，你就像一个巡警。你处理九点到十一点的呼叫，或者任何需要你注意的事情。他是自己被指控贩毒的警官之一。他是一名警官，我们知道他被指控泄露了监狱官员的地址，然后这些涉嫌罪犯试图杀死他。而且，我们也知道他参与了其他涉嫌的阴谋，比如试图保护市内非法的**大麻商店**。我们知道大麻已经合法化，但仍存在非法大麻问题，所以 there's a whole host of allegations of 妨碍司法公正，诬告他人贩毒，正如我所说，以及最终参与密谋杀人。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So he's one of those 12 division officers. He's been on the force for 19 years. He's been a constable that whole time, which means typically at a division you're like a rogue cop. You go out to nine, 11 calls or anything that requires your attention. He is one of those officers who is himself charged with trafficking in drugs. He is an officer who we know is alleged to have leaked the address of the jail official, who then these alleged criminals tried to kill. Okay. And we also know that he is involved in other alleged conspiracies, such as trying to protect illegal pot shops in the city. We know cannabis was legalised. There are still issues with illegal marijuana, and so there's a whole host of allegations of obstructing justice, falsely accusing people trafficking in drugs, as I said, and that involvement in the eventual conspiracy to commit murder.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道在多伦多警方公布调查结果的新闻发布会上，有人问到‘南线计划’是否与近来一直成为头条新闻的**GTA拖车大战**有关。我们知道些什么？那里有更强的联系吗？我们对此了解多少？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, I know at the press conference when Toronto police unveiled the investigation, there were questions posed to Project South ties to the tow truck wars that have been in the headlines for quite a while in GTA. What do we know? Is there is there a stronger connection there? What do we know about that?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的，新闻发布会发生时我们有些惊讶。我的同事艾比·奥布莱恩（Abby O'Brien）当时在场，她一直在报道这个拖车问题，我们认出了其中一名平民的名字。此人曾因我提到的在GTA（大**多伦多**地区）包括沃恩（Vaughan）在内的多个住宅进行枪击事件而被捕。其中一处住宅据称属于这个拖车行业的一个所谓的“头目”，你知道，正如你提到的，你的观众可能已经看到了，那里一直存在很多内斗，甚至被称为“战争”。在这些地点，家庭住址，拖车场，反复发生枪击事件。这确实是个很严重的问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, we were sort of surprised when the press conference happened. My colleague Abby O'Brien was there, and she's been covering this tow truck issue a lot, and we Recognized one of the names of the civilians. That person was previously arrested for the incidents. I mentioned shooting up various houses in the GTA, including in Vaughan. One of those houses allegedly belongs to a so-called kingpin in this tow truck industry, which, you know, your viewers may have seen, as you mentioned, that there's been a lot of infighting to the extent of, you know, calling it a war. Shootings back and forth repeatedly in these locations, home addresses, tow truck yards. It's been really problematic.

</details>

**主持人**: 必须问一个问题。这也是在新闻发布会上被问到的问题。但由于对警务腐败的调查，是否有任何刑事案件受到影响？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: One has to ask. And this was a question that was asked at that press conference as well. But have any criminal cases been compromised because of the probe into police corruption?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 我们一直在积极调查此事。我们一直在与刑事辩护律师交谈以找出答案。到目前为止，我还没有听说任何案件因此而失败，但我认为现在还为时过早。这显然是一个巨大的担忧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: We've been actively searching that out. We've been talking to criminal defence lawyers to find that out. So far, I haven't heard of any cases falling apart, but I think it's still a little bit early days for that. And that is obviously a huge concern.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们提到了安大略省警务监察局正在对安大略省所有警务部门进行审查。这是否意味着问题超出了几个害群之马？显然，这里的案件大部分都与GTA有关。但这个问题是否超出了这个范围？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We mentioned Ontario's Inspectorate of Policing is launching a review into all police departments across Ontario. Does that mean the problem goes beyond just a few bad apples? Obviously this case here is really tied into the the GTA for the most part. But does this problem go beyond that?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的，我认为这是一个有效的问题。我个人非常好奇警务总监会发现什么。我认为除了这个多伦多警局之外，我们没有其他指控。以及，你知道，那三名未被刑事起诉的皮尔警官。然而，关于监督、警官如何获取敏感信息以及他们与这些犯罪实体合作的动机，存在一些更大的问题。我认为值得探讨。当然，我将非常感兴趣地想知道他们对多伦多警局的调查有多深入，以及他们是否会发现该警局更多系统性问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, I think it's a valid question. I'm personally really curious to see what the inspector general finds. I don't think we have any allegations beyond this Toronto Police Department. And, you know, those three Peel officers who have not been criminally charged. However, there are some bigger questions about supervision, the way police have access to sensitive information and just overall, their ability to be incentivised to work with this, these criminal entities. And I think it's worth exploring. Of course, I'll be very interested to know how deeply they go on the Toronto police force and whether they uncover any more systemic issues with that force.

</details>

**主持人**: 让我们谈谈反应。政治领导人当然很快就他们的想法发表了看法，警员工会也是。他们到目前为止是如何反应的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Let's talk reaction. Political leaders, of course, have been quick to jump on sort of their thoughts on here, police unions as well. How are they reacting so far?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 嗯，有一些关于多伦多警察局长**迈伦·德姆科**（Myron Demko）是否会面临领导力质疑的问题。到目前为止，与幕后人士交谈，我没有看到来自市长办公室、负责监督该部门的警察委员会或工会（他们经常对警务管理发表负面看法）的任何强烈呼吁，甚至任何呼吁。所以，我认为目前德姆科局长并没有因此承担责任。他似乎对此相当认真。但当然，如我们所知，调查尚未结束。所以我们还在等待看政治上会如何发展。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Well, there were some questions about whether Toronto Police Chief Myron Demko was going to face questions of leadership so far, talking to people behind the scenes. I'm not seeing any strong calls or any calls at all, really, from the mayor's office, from the police board that oversees the force or from the union, who often has a lot of negative things to say about policing management. So I think for now, Demko is not taking the fall for this. He seems to be taking it relatively seriously. But of course, the investigation as we know, is not over. So we're just waiting to see how that plays out politically.

</details>

**主持人**: 你提到了德姆科局长。显然，这对公众信任是一个巨大的打击。所以我很好奇，公众成员在说什么？你知道，就在不久前，还有人呼吁**取消警察经费**。我们正在谈论的是预算。所以，你知道，当我们谈论分配给警察薪水的钱时，这些通常是排名很高的。但公众在说什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You mentioned Chief Demko. Obviously this is a big hit to public trust. And so I am curious, what are members of the public saying? You know, it wasn't that long ago when there were calls for defunding the police. We are talking we are in the midst of budgets. So, you know, these are usually pretty high up there when we talk about the money allocated to salaries for police. But what are the public saying?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 是的，我认为就像我们过去十年，尤其是在过去五年里，公众对警方的态度发生了巨大的转变。我认为这次调查，对很多人来说，证实了他们认为已经发生的事情，即警务腐败。现在，我认为没有人真正知道具体发生了什么，或者能够预测到这一点。我当然没有，但我认为这正在加剧许多对警方的负面看法。这对德姆科局长和整个警务部门来说是一个巨大的挑战，他们需要付出很多努力来修复已经破裂的警务信任。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, I think like we've seen such a huge shift in attitudes toward policing over the last decade and especially over the last five years. And I think it this investigation, I think, for a lot of people, validates what they felt was already happening in terms of corrupt policing. Now, I don't think anyone really knew specifically that this was going on or could have predicted this. I certainly didn't, but I think it's reinforcing a lot of negative opinions about policing. And that's a huge mountain for Demke and the service as a whole to overcome. And they have a lot of work to do to already repair a fractured trust in policing.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在这个犯罪报道领域已经有一段时间了。我得问一下，在多伦多警方的历史上，或者在你报道过的故事中，有没有发生过类似的事情？我们才刚刚开始。你见过类似的事情吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You have been on the crime beat for for a bit here. I got to ask, has there been anything like this in Toronto police history or in just in the stories that you have covered in general? We are just at the beginning here. Yeah. Have you seen anything like this?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 不，我真的无法想象会发生这样的事情。你知道，就在我们开始听到最初的传言，然后能够证实有七名警官被指控是约克地区一项大规模警务调查的一部分的那晚。这从未发生过。这是前所未有的。我们正处于未知领域，并且仍在等待看事态会发展到何种程度。我问过德姆科局长，他是否预计会有更多警员被捕，他说他不想猜测调查会带来什么。所以我们正在关注接下来会发生什么。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: No, I honestly couldn't have imagined anything like this. You know, the night that we were starting to hear the initial rumours and then were able to confirm seven officers accused as part of a massive York police investigation. It's just never happened. It's unprecedented. We're in uncharted territory, and we're still waiting to see how far this goes. I asked chief Demkiw if he expected more arrests of his members, and he said he didn't want to speculate on what the investigation would bring. So we're tuning in to see what happens next.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们也会如此。詹妮弗，非常感谢你。非常感谢你的时间。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. As will we. Jennifer, thank you very much. Really appreciate your time.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕利亚罗**: 非常感谢你的邀请。

### 加拿大公信力与腐败指数

**主持人**: 在这个国家，警务腐败是否罕见？更广泛地说，加拿大的机构通常被认为是值得信赖的吗？每年，**透明国际**（Transparency International）都会发布**《全球腐败感知指数》**（Corruption Perceptions Index），该指数根据各国公共部门的腐败程度看法对各国进行排名。**透明国际加拿大**的执行董事**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**（Salvatore Cusumano）现在在演播室与我们交流。你好吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is police corruption rare in this country and more broadly, are Canadian institutions usually seen as trustworthy? Each year, Transparency International releases the Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries based on how corrupt their public sectors are perceived to be. Salvatore Cusumano is the executive director of Transparency International Canada, and he joins us in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 很好。感谢邀请我。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Great. Thank you for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 很高兴你来。我们今天来谈谈腐败。所以我想我们应该从最近在多伦多及其他地区成为头条新闻的腐败丑闻开始谈起。但你对目前的多伦多警务腐败丑闻有何看法？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Great to have you here. Let's start off with we're here to talk corruption. So I think it's fair that we start the conversation with corruption scandal that's taken the headlines here in Toronto and broader. But what's your take on the Toronto police corruption scandal right now?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 我认为这向我们展示了一个非常清晰、尽管不幸的例子，说明了腐败在加拿大是如何运作的。当然，这些指控尚未被证实。我今天所说的一切，当然都是对现有的正当程序和正在进行的调查的尊重。但我认为这表明，在腐败问题上，需要双方配合。我的意思是，一方面，当我们谈论腐败时，确实有公职人员必须愿意参与这种行为，那些将利用其权力或权威地位谋取个人、私人或潜在犯罪利益的人。另一方面，也有相应的行为者或一方，在某些情况下，他们可能促成了腐败，甚至胁迫了腐败。而且，你知道，在这种情况下，我们不幸地看到了对为公众服务的公职人员的指控，他们可能被那些试图利用公共机构谋取非常邪恶目的的个人所牵连。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: I mean, I think it shows us it's a really elegant, if unfortunate illustration of how corruption works in Canada. Of course, the allegations haven't been proven yet. And anything I say today, of course, is really respectful of the due process that exists and the investigations that are continuing. But I think it shows you that with corruption, it takes two to tango. What I mean by that is that on the one hand, when we talk about corruption, you do have public officials who have to be willing to engage in the behaviour, people who are going to use their position of power or authority to personal, private or potentially criminal benefit. On the other hand, you have just that, which is an actor or a party that motivates the corruption in some cases, maybe coerces the corruption. And, you know, in this case, we see, unfortunately, allegations of public officials serving the public who may have been tied up in behaviour by actors who were looking to exploit a public institution for some very nefarious purposes.

</details>

**主持人**: 你用了“清晰”这个词。请解释一下。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You use the word elegant. Help explain that?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 嗯，我认为它很清晰，因为，你知道，在透明国际，我们是这个全球组织的加拿大分部。而清晰之处在于，如果属实，它清楚地说明了我们的加拿大机构面临的脆弱性。一方面，我认为调查有望指出一些我们可以改进我们机构的系统性倾向。但另一方面，它确实显示了对加拿大有组织犯罪日益增长的担忧，以及有组织犯罪如何真正影响我们机构的诚信。所以，从这个意义上说，它是清晰的，因为它已经公开了。我们很幸运能看到它。我们确实赞赏那些将其公之于众的调查人员。其中也有清晰之处，即我们看到了我们投入到这些类型调查中的资源的影响。但不幸的是，负面影响也是显而易见的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Well, I think it's elegant because, you know, at Transparency International, we're the Canadian chapter of a of a global organisation. And what's elegant is that it's a really, really clear illustration. If it's proven of the vulnerabilities that our institutions face in Canada. On the one hand, you know, I think the investigations hopefully will point to some of the sort of systemic tendencies that we could improve in our institutions. But on the other hand, it does show a rising concern with organised crime in Canada and the way that organised crime can, can really impact the integrity of our institutions. And so it's elegant in that sense because it's come out in public. We're fortunate to see it. And we do applaud the investigators who brought it to light. There's elegance in that too, that that we see the impact of the resources we put into these types of investigations. But unfortunately, the downsides are are evident as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 加拿大警务腐败有多罕见？这些机构本身就是调查腐败案件的机构。所以我们反过来看，这种情况罕见吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How corruption in policing is that, is that rare in Canada? These are the institutions that would sort of be investigating corruption cases on their own. So we flip that case is is it rare to see.

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 这是个好问题。我想，一方面，我希望正在进行的调查能告诉我们，这只是多伦多警局和多伦多地区警务部门的一个孤立事件。但并非如此，我们确实在加拿大的警务部门中看到过腐败案例。我们也看到过其他类型的违规行为。有时两者是相关的。但我认为这里的真正启示是，我认为加拿大有时有一种观念，认为腐败或“腐败”这个词指的是发生在别处的事情，指的是发生在非民主国家的事情。我认为我们在这里看到的是一个真实的提醒，即正是这些类型的公共机构，在这个案例中，本应识别和起诉此类行为。犯罪组织也在瞄准这些实体，因为它们需要这些实体来实施它们正在进行的活动。这些是脆弱的机构。如果我们放松警惕，随着这些团伙变得越来越复杂，这种行为可能会变得更加普遍。但它确实存在于加拿大。它曾经存在过，我们希望在这种情况下它是孤立的。但我们必须看看结果如何。

**Salvatore Cusumano**: That's a good question. And I think that, you know, on the one hand, I hope that the investigations that are going on will tell us, hopefully, that this is an isolated incident in the Toronto police and in Toronto police, Toronto Area police services. But no, we've seen cases of of of corruption in in police services in Canada. We've also seen issues of of other types of misconduct that exist. Sometimes the two are linked. But I think the real takeaway here is that I think there's a sense sometimes in Canada that that corruption or the word corruption refers to something that happens elsewhere, that it refers to something that happens in countries that are not democratic. I think I think what we see here is a real reminder that it is these types of public institutions that in this case, are supposed to be identifying, prosecuting this type of behaviour. Criminal organisations are targeting those, those, those entities as well, because they need to to carry out the types of activities they're doing. These are vulnerable institutions. And if we let our foot off the gas, as these groups become more sophisticated, this type of behaviour could become more common as well. But it does exist in Canada. It has existed, and we hope in this case it's isolated. But we'll have to see what comes out.

**主持人**: 好的。我们稍微换个话题，我想放大视野，谈谈**透明国际**的**2025年《全球腐败感知指数》**。对于不熟悉它的人来说，它是什么？它的方法论是什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's switch gears a bit and I want to zoom out and talk about the Transparency International's 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index for people who aren't familiar with it. What is it? What's the methodology?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 这是个很好的问题。所以，《腐败感知指数》可以说是目前世界上讨论最多的腐败指数。透明国际已经做了大约20年了。它基本上显示了专家和商业领袖对一个国家腐败程度的看法。现在，当我说是“感知”时，它并不是一个直接衡量一个国家发生了多少起警察丑闻的指标。它更多地衡量了人们对加拿大作为一个做生意的地方有多大的信心和确定性？加拿大作为一个公民生活的地方，以及期望其机构承担责任的程度？现在，我们今年看到的排名是，有182个国家上榜。加拿大排在第16位。所以你可以说“第16位最好”。我想如果我们看看现在的米兰-科尔蒂纳（Milano Cortina），我们不会满足于第16位。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: That's a great question. So the Corruption Perceptions Index is sort of it's probably the most discussed index on corruption in the world right now. Transparency international has been doing it for, for for about 20 years. And what it basically shows is the perceptions of experts and business leaders vis a vis the perceived levels of corruption that exist in a country. Now, when I say perceived, it's not a direct measure of how many police scandals took place in the country. It's it's more a measure of what is the confidence and what is the degree of certainty that people have about what kind of place is Canada to do business? What kind of place is Canada to be a citizen and to expect accountability from its institutions? Now, what we saw on the rankings this year, 182 countries were ranked. Canada was 16th from the top. So you could say 16th best. I think if we're looking to Milano Cortina right now, we're not going to settle for 16th.

**主持人**: 在曲棍球方面。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In hockey.

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 说得对。但你知道，我认为这再次表明，就像我们在警察丑闻中看到的那样，当我说是第16位时，这是一个**下降趋势**，是自我们开始编制该指数以来的**最低排名**。自2012年我们能够标准化分数以来，在全球范围内，这仍然可能是一个不错的得分。你知道，排名前10%。但我们担心的是这种趋势，因为我们认为它也反映并伴随着公众对我们机构的信任度下降，以及一种观念，即在起诉这些类型的犯罪方面，事情在某些方面并不奏效。顺便说一句，你知道，商业领袖参与了我们指数的数据来源，这应该引起关注，因为加拿大正试图实现贸易和投资伙伴关系的多元化。你知道，如果我们的国家，我们的金融体系不被认为是安全、干净的，那么投资者在尽职调查、检查资金去向方面就会增加成本。而且，你知道，我们真的认为，在所有方面——公众信任和投资者信任方面。坦率地说，我们需要做得更好，扭转局面。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Fair enough. But you know, I think it shows again, this it's sort of what you see in the police scandal is that when I say 16th, that's a **downward trend**, the **lowest ranking ever** for Canada since we started the index. And since we were able to kind of standardise the scores in 2012, it could still be a good score in a global context. You know, top 10%. But it's that trend we're worried about because we think it also reflects and tracks with declining public trust in our institutions and a perception that that things aren't working in some way when it comes to to prosecuting these types of crimes. And as an aside, you know, the fact that business leaders are involved in the types of indices that feed into our index, it should be a cause for concern at a time when Canada is trying to diversify its trade and investment partnerships. You know, if our country, if our financial systems are not deemed to be secure, clean, it does increase costs for investors in terms of due diligence, in terms of checking where their money is going. And, you know, we really think on on all aspects public trust and investor trust. Frankly, we need to do a much better job and turn the ship around.

**主持人**: 我不想做同样的奥运会类比，但你知道，当我们看这个的时候，很难不进行比较。与其他民主国家相比，我们如何？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I don't want to make the same analogy of the Olympics here, but, you know, it's hard not to compete or compare ourselves when we're looking at this. How do we compare to other Democratic peers?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 今年出现的一个有趣现象是，我们看到加拿大所谓的“同等民主国家”——G7国家、一些北约伙伴等——也出现了类似的持续下降趋势。现在，一方面，你可能会倾向于说，哦，这里发生的事情并没有那么特别。我认为，当你回想我们总理在世界经济论坛上谈到的内容时，你确实看到了，在某种程度上，一个存在于许多国家中的威胁，一种**公众信任下降的类似趋势**，我们希望这不会预示着民主整体表现出更深层的问题。我们相信加拿大可以在这个国家群体中成为领导者。我们的总理确实说过他希望我们能成为领导者，他打算让我们成为领导者。我认为这是民主国家必须共同努力，找出我们机构中哪些方面未能赢得公众信任，以及我们如何改变这一点的一个领域。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: So one of the interesting things that came out this year is we saw a sustained trend of a similar decline among what you might call Canada's peer democracies, countries in the G7, some of its NATO partners, and so on. Now, again, on the one hand, you might be tempted to say, oh, well, what's happening here is not that exceptional. I think when you think back to, for example, what our Prime Minister talked about at the World Economic Forum, you know, you do see, in a sense, a threat that exists across many countries, a similar trend of declining public trust that we hope doesn't signal something deeper about how democracy in general is performing. We we believe that Canada can be a leader in in this community of countries. Our prime minister has certainly said he hopes that we can be he intends for us to be. And I think this is one area where democracies really have to come together and identify what is it about our institutions that is not keeping the public trust, and how can we change that?

</details>

**主持人**: 从那个放大的视角来看，从全球来看，你谈到了感知与实际腐败。你能举一些例子来说明感知会是什么样子，而实际情况又是什么样的吗？当我们看看指数的下半部分，那些国家的时候。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When we look at sort of from that zoomed out perspective from from the global side, you talked about perception versus actual corruption. Can you give us some some examples in terms of what a perception would look like versus actual? When we look at maybe down that index, when we get down to the bottom half of these countries.

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 当然。也许我可以谈谈一个国家的金融部门。另一件事是**公司所有权透明度**。这两件事有时会齐头并进。例如，我们在指数中可以看到的一个重要方面是，人们对与谁做生意有何信心，以及资金从何而来，当它流入加拿大、流经加拿大和流出加拿大时。现在，《腐败感知指数》是关于公共部门机构的。这一点很重要。但这些更广泛的问题围绕着……我们对哪些公司与加拿大政府或安大略省政府做生意了解多少？例如？我们很幸运，在透明国际，我们能够与各级政府合作，现在有一个联邦层面和几个省份注册公司的注册表，了解它们背后的实际控制人，存在哪些数据？我们认为，在推广到所有省份方面仍有空间。加拿大公共部门腐败的一个问题是，它是一个复杂的环境。你在联邦、省级，甚至在某些情况下，在市级都有相关的法规。由于加拿大的复杂性，人们有时需要额外的确定性才能拥有信任。我们当然也能从公民的角度看到这一点。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Sure. Maybe one thing I can talk about is the financial sector in a country. Another thing I could talk about is the type of corporate ownership transparency that exists. And these two things can can go hand in hand sometimes. For example, one of the things that that we can really see in the index coming through is what kind of confidence exists in who are people doing business with, and where does money come from when it's flowing into Canada, through Canada and out of Canada? Now the Corruption Perceptions Index is about public sector institutions. That's important to mention. But these kind of broader questions around how, how how well is it known, what companies are doing business with the Canadian government or with the Ontario government, for example? We are fortunate at Transparency International to have been able to work with government at various levels to have a registry now of companies that are registered at federal level and in a couple of provinces, who's behind them, what data exists? We think that still there could be room to roll this out across all provinces, an issue that you'll see come into public sector corruption in Canada is that it is a complicated environment. You've got regulations at federal level, provincial level, even at some, in some cases municipal level with these things. And because Canada's complex people need an additional level of certainty sometimes to be able to, to, to have, have trust. And we certainly see that in Canada from a citizens perspective as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 在这方面，加拿大采取了哪些措施来增强人们对我们制度拥有防范腐败的保障措施的信心？显然还有很多工作要做，但我们到目前为止做了什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: With that, what steps has Canada taken to shore up confidence that our system has safeguards against corruption? Obviously there's work to be done, but what have we done so far?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 当然，我们有。我们现在有机会与一个负责审查加拿大反洗钱框架完整性的全球机构合作，即**金融行动特别工作组**（Financial Action Task Force），他们目前正在完成一项审查，将审视加拿大在过去五年和十年中在加强一个曾被发现存在一些缺陷的框架方面取得了多大进展。现在加拿大已经做了一些我们认为在实践中可以更强的事情。一是打开了公司“黑箱”，联邦层面的编号公司。现在它们可以在公共注册表中查看，BC省和魁北克省也是如此。安大略省也宣布将这样做。你知道，这是一个展示给像这样的机构，以及向我们的公民展示，你不能躲在编号公司后面，你必须公开做生意的好机会。所以我们可以看到，我们希望这能在加拿大推广开来。但这是一个好步骤。另一个是，我们刚刚看到加拿大宣布，政府在2025年预算中宣布，将创建一个新的**金融犯罪机构**，该机构可能会审查我所说的“供应方”，即组织试图腐蚀我们机构的情况。该机构理论上应该有助于改善皇家骑警、省级警察、**Fintrac**（金融情报部门）等机构之间的协调。这是一个好步骤。它已经在预算中命名，但我们想知道它背后有多少资源。它将如何协调这些实体，而不是再增加一个？这两件事都有巨大的潜力，但这在加拿大是常有的情况。我们看到好的公告，我们现在必须真正让它们有效。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Sure we have. We have the fortunate opportunity right now, a global body that looks at the integrity of our anti-money laundering framework in Canada, the Financial Action Task Force, they're actually wrapping up a review right now that's going to look at how far has Canada come over the last five and ten years in, in strengthening a framework that there had been some deficiencies identified. Now Canada has done a couple of things that we think could be stronger in practice. One is opening up that corporate black box numbered companies at the federal level. Now they're they're available for viewing on a public registry, B.C. and Quebec as well. Ontario has announced they're going to do it as well. You know, this is a really good opportunity to to show a body like this, but also our citizens that you can't hide behind a numbered company. You've got to you've got to do business openly. So we could see that we hope that will spread out across Canada. But it's a good step. Another one is we just saw Canada announce the government announced in the budget 2025 budget, the creation of a new financial crimes agency, which might look into that sort of supply side. I talked about where you have organisations trying to corrupt our institutions. This agency should theoretically help improve the coordination between bodies like RCMP, provincial level police Fintrac, the financial intelligence unit. That's a good step. It's been named in the budget, but we would want to know what kind of resources are behind it. How is it going to harmonise those those entities rather than add another one to the mix? Those are two things that they have great potential, but it's kind of the story. In Canada. We see good announcements. We have to really make them effective now.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。**卡尼总理**（Prime Minister Carney）的政府通过了《**加拿大建设法案**》（Building Canada Act），以加快被视为国家利益的基础设施项目。当我们看到“加快”时，我们会想到事情会加速，但可能会遗漏一些东西。这是否会带来腐败的机会？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Prime Minister Carney's government passed the Building Canada Act to expedite infrastructure projects deemed in the nation's interest. When we see expedite, we think things are going to speed up there. There might be some things that are missing there. Are there any risks that this would create opportunity for corruption?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 当然。我认为我们**透明国际加拿大**通过我们的国际网络知道，当你加快做生意的方式、投资方式、公共支出方式时，如果同时不以同等的速度增加透明度和监督，公共资金就会被滥用。我们可以看看**新冠疫情**期间发生了什么。我认为每个人都知道一些公共资金的滥用事件，比如**Arrivecan**这个名字，它本应是我们确保国家安全和改善公共卫生的一项骄傲，但现在它已成为公共支出如何被使用的臭名昭著的例子。如果我们不以正确的方式管理这个关键时刻，这种事件可能会成千上万次地发生。因此，当我们看到例如创建新的**国防投资机构**时，你知道，这可以成为改善我们国家国防的一个很好的方式。但我们需要确保，当我们创建这些渠道时，有机会尽可能地向公众公开，尤其是在国防这样敏感的事情上，关于资金的去向，它是否以竞争性的方式支出，以及它是否真的在最终改善我们的国防。因为这是底线。如果我们花钱但没有改善国防，那将损害公众信任。基础设施和许多其他优先事项也是如此。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Certainly. I think that we at Transparency International Canada know through our international network that when you speed up the the way you do business, the way you make investments, the way you spend public money, if at the same time you're not increasing transparency and increasing oversight at a similar rate, public money is going to be misspent. We could look at what happened during Covid, for example. I think that everybody knows some of the the public misspending that took place, the name Arrivecan, while it should have been a source of pride for something that secured our country and improved our public health, it's now become an infamous name in terms of how our money is, is, is spent that that incident could be multiplied many, many times over. If we don't manage this critical moment the right way. And so when we see the creation of things like, for example, a new Defence investment agency, you know, that can be a very good way of helping improve our country's defence. But we need to make sure that when when you do create these kind of channels, that there is an opportunity to, to to be open with the public as much as you can with something as sensitive as defence about where the money is being spent, that it's being spent competitively, and that it is actually, at the end of the day, improving our defence. Because that's the bottom line. If we spend money and it doesn't improve our defence, that will undermine public trust. Same goes with infrastructure and many other priorities.

**主持人**: 非常快速地。当我们谈论加拿大时，很难不谈论美国。对一些人来说，美国在某种程度上一直是“世界警察”。在这个政府的领导下，他们在**警务腐败**方面做得怎么样？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Very quickly. When we're talking about Canada, it's hard not to have a conversation about the US as well. To some, the US has been the world's policeman to some extent. How have they been doing at policing corruption under this administration?

</details>

**萨尔瓦多·库苏马诺**: 嗯，他们已经宣布**撤销**某些法律的执法，而这些法律对于将人们绳之以法至关重要，无论是在美国还是在国外。现在，我认为我们将看到，现在还为时过早，如果你能想象一年后的情况，我们已经看到了很多。但在这一方面，我认为现在判断它将走向何方还为时过早。这再次提醒我们，这些事情可能会被武器化。它提醒我们，你不想让自己成为目标。我们需要在所有这些事情上做到无可挑剔。这不仅仅是撤销执法的可能性，还包括以适合借口的方式使用它的可能性。我们已经看到本届政府以芬太尼流入美国为由，来实施关税。这只是一个呼吁，无论我们南方发生了什么，我们有很多事情可以做得更好。让我们不要给任何人留下指责的理由。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: Well, they've announced the rollback of certain of the enforcement of certain laws that were instrumental in bringing people to justice, both in the US and abroad. Now, I think what we'll see, it's still early to tell, if you can imagine a year in, we have seen so much. But on this front, I think it's still early to tell where it will go. It's again a reminder that these things can be weaponized. It's a reminder that you don't want to make yourself a target. We need to be impeccable on all of these things. It's not just the potential of rolling back enforcement, it's the potential of using it in ways that suit pretexts. We have seen this administration use, you know, the justification of, of of fentanyl flowing across the border into the US as a reason to apply tariffs. It's just a call to say whatever is happening south of us, there are so many things we can do to get better. Let's not give anyone a reason to to point the finger.
