### 纽约夜生活：繁荣的经济引擎

[音乐]

**Joe Weisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客。我是乔·魏森塔尔。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我是特蕾西·阿洛韦。特蕾西，我们今天有一期特别的播客节目，它几乎不需要任何介绍，但我们正在与市长对话。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, we have a special episode of the podcast today which needs very little introduction, but we are speaking uh to the mayor.</p>
</details>

我喜欢我们向地方城市记者角色的转变。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I love our transition to local city reporters.</p>
</details>

了解我们的城市真的很有趣。亚当斯市长，纽约市市长亚当斯，非常感谢您来到《Odd Lots》。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's really fun learning about our city. Mayor Adams, New York City Mayor Adams, thank you so much for coming on OddLots.</p>
</details>

谢谢，谢谢。我想这周或上周是我第二次来这里？日子过得太快了，但能在彭博社这里真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. Thank you. I think this is my second time this week or was it last week? The days go to fast, but it's great here being at Bloomberg.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 谢谢您。我最近读了记者德里克·汤普森（Derek Thompson）的一篇文章。他谈到了美国派对文化的消亡。人们似乎不像以前那样经常开派对了。纽约市的人们仍然开派对，但你知道，24小时营业的俱乐部不像以前那么多了。显然，凌晨4点的酒牌也减少了。您是一个热爱夜生活和派对的人。发生了什么？为什么人们不像以前那样经常开派对了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's f Thank you so much. I read an article recently from the journalist Derek Thompson. He was talking about the death of partying in America. People apparently don't party as much as they used to. New York City people still party, but like, you know, there aren't as many 24-hour clubs as they used to be. Apparently, there's fewer 4 a.m. liquor licenses, etc. You're a man who appreciates night life and partying. What happened? Why don't people party as much as they used to?</p>
</details>

问得好。首先，我为什么欣赏夜生活呢？它是一个300亿美元的产业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great question. And first of all, is why do I appreciate the night life? It's a $30 billion industry</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们经常把城市看作是朝九晚五的，但它不是。当我还是警察的时候，我上过夜班，午夜班。当我走进一家夜生活场所，一家餐厅，我走进厨房，与洗碗工交谈，与服务生交谈。他们都是每天辛勤工作的普通人。我知道，在疫情结束后，我必须让我们的夜生活恢复生机。我们也做到了。你现在在城里很难订到座位了。百老汇（Broadway）创下了城市历史上最好的12个月业绩。而夜生活复苏的一部分就是我们的特色是什么？纽约，这座城市……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we viewed the city often as mayors we viewed it as 9 to5 but it's not. When I was a police officer I work overnights midnights and when I go into a night life a restaurant I walk in the kitchen kitchen I talk to the dishwasher. I talk to the bus boy or girl. Those are everyday workingass people. And I knew when I came back after co I had to turn our night life around. And we did that. You can't get reservations in the city anymore. Broadway had the best 12 months in the history of the city. And part of coming back out at night is what is our signature? New York, the city that</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 没有派对危机。

<details>

<p class="english-text">there's no party crisis.</p>
</details>

不，没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it's not.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 仍然比以前关门早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Still shuts down earlier than it used to.</p>
</details>

不，确实如此。我认为问题的一部分在于，社区委员会中有太多长期任职的人，他们没有将经济效益与他们不希望有任何夜生活的愿望联系起来。夜生活对社区很重要。它让人放松、建立联系，并真正促进合作。听着，你来到纽约，你会在这里找到你的伴侣，因为这座伟大的城市拥有多样性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it does. And and part of the problem I believe you have far too many people on community boards that have been for a long time and they're not connecting the economics with their desire really not to have any night life. Night life is important of the community. It's allowed to let off some steam networking uh really uh collaborating. Listen, you come to New York, you're going to find your mate here because the diversity of this great city.</p>
</details>

### 住房政策与城市发展：解决长期挑战

**Tracy Alloway:** 我想问一些其他的具体政策提案，特别是住房问题。你知道，我访问了您的网站，看到了您提案的摘要，然后我点击了“了解更多”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wanted to ask about some other specific policy proposals, specifically housing and you know I went to your website and I I saw the sort of summary of your proposals and then I clicked into learn more</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 它把我带到了您第一任期内的成就页面。所以我很好奇，您能否详细阐述一下您的住房政策，比如您到底在谈论什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it took me to your previous accomplishments under your first term. So I'm really curious if you could maybe broaden out some of your housing policies like what exactly are you talking about here?</p>
</details>

好的，首先让我们看看这样一个事实：当我们谈论动工建设以及我们在重新分区中提出的方案时，包括城市历史上最全面的住房改革，上一次大规模改革是60年前，那是我们真正开始关注住房和一些改革的时候。我们将在一个任期内建造比彭博（Bloomberg）市长任期12年和德布拉西奥（De Blasio）市长任期8年加起来还要多的住房。我们正在向我们的十年资本计划投入250亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first let's let's look at the fact that when you look at shovels in the ground and what we're proposing in our resoning, including the most comprehensive housing reform in the history of the city, 60 years previously was the first time we really started looking at housing and some of the reform. We're going to build more housing in one term than the 12 years under Bloomberg, the eight years under Delasio combined in one term. And $25 billion we're putting into our 10-year capital plan.</p>
</details>

除此之外，我们历史上首次将**NYCHA**（New York City Housing Authority: 纽约市房屋管理局，负责管理公共住房）的住房纳入计划。所以，我们正在关注几个不同的方面。第一，我们看到联邦和州政府放弃了NYCHA。NYCHA面临880亿美元的资本问题。我们必须找到在NYCHA土地上建设的新方法。我们完成了**土地信托**（Land Trust），许多人尝试过，我们做到了。我们还在实施**RAD计划**（Rental Assistance Demonstration: 租赁援助示范计划，允许公共住房机构利用私人资金进行翻新）。许多人曾试图做，我们也做到了。我们即将在里斯住宅区（Reese houses）进行的惊人项目，我们将拆除旧建筑，建造新建筑，并且不会有任何租户被强制搬迁。这就是我们处理NYCHA问题的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition to that, for the first time in history, we are including NICHA uh uh housing into the plan. So, we we're looking at a couple of different locations. Number one, we saw the federal and state government walk away from NICHA. Uh Nicha has a $88 billion dollar capital problem. We had to find new ways of building on NICHA. We did the land trust. Many people tried, we got it done. Uh we're also doing the RAD programs. Many people have attempted to do it. We got it done. The amazing project that we are getting ready to do in Reese houses where we're going to tear down old buildings, build new buildings, and without zero displacement of tenants. That's how we deal with the Nicha issue.</p>
</details>

然后我们意识到，如果我们要建造更多住房，我们必须在各地建造。令人难以置信的是，有多少民选官员在阻止这种建设。59个社区委员会中，有10个委员会建造的经济适用房比其他49个加起来还要多。所以我们现在的目标是在全市各地建造。这就是“城市说‘是’”（City of Yes）的意义所在，在每个社区建造更多住房，让居民和租户能够留在自己的社区，而不是离开城市。所以我们未来的目标是更快地建造，建造更多。现在开车经过威利斯角（Willis Point），那里有2400套经济适用房。新的足球场由私人资金支付，还有一所新学校，新的开放空间。你看到这些建筑在同一个任期内拔地而起。所以我们的重点是建造更多，并且在各地建造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then we realized that if we want to build more housing, we have to build everywhere. It was unbelievable how many elected officials were stopping that building. 59 community boards, 10 of those 59 were building more affordable housing than 49 combined. So our goal now is to build all over the city. And that's what city of Yes was about a little more housing in every community that we could allow residents and tenants to stay in their community instead of leaving the city. So our goal in the future as we move forward with forward we want to build faster. We want to build more. Drive by Willis Point right now 2400 units of affordable housing that's there. New soccer stadium that's paid private dollars a new school new open space. And you see the buildings actually going up in the same term. So our focus is building more and build building everywhere.</p>
</details>

我第一次听说伊丽莎白街花园（Elizabeth Street Garden）的争议是在2018年，我想。现在是2025年，您已经站出来说：“好吧，让我们继续前进，不要再为此争吵了。”但抛开使用那个空间建造住房是否正确的问题。抛开这些问题，为什么需要七年或更长时间才能得出这些问题的答案？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first time I ever heard about controversy at the Elizabeth Street Garden was in 20 2018, I think. And then now it's 2025 and you've come out and you said, "Okay, like let's move on. Let's not continue to fight this." But setting aside whether it was it's right to use that space for housing or not. Like setting aside these questions, why does it take seven years or longer to come to answers on these questions?</p>
</details>

问得好。如果你分析我们所做的一切，我们成功解决了其他人无法解决的问题。当你排除所有噪音，排除政府中的所有噪音，然后说：“好吧，让我们看看原始数据。”就像你说的，你的听众都很老练。看看原始数据。我们成功解决了总督岛（Governor's Island）的问题。我们成功解决了日落公园（Sunset Park）的问题。我们能够解决这些困难的任务。那么，当我们请兰迪·马斯特罗（Randy Mastro）担任第一副市长时，我们做了什么？他看了看，他说：“我们如何利用这个空间？我们如何才能取得胜利？”我们做到了。伊丽莎白街花园原本计划建造约125套住房，120套。我们现在将获得625套住房。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great question. And if you if you do an analysis over all the things that we've done, we've land pl we landed planes that no one else was able to do. When you rid all the noise, take all the noise out of the administration and just say, "Okay, let's look at the raw numbers." Like you said, your your listeners are sophisticated. Look at the raw numbers. Uh we were able to land a plane on Governor Governor's Island. We were able to land a plane in Sunset Sunset Park. We're able to land the plane on these difficult tasks. So what did we do when we brought in Randy Mastro as the first deputy mayor? He was he looked at it. He says, "How can we leverage this space? How could we walk away with a win?" We did. Uh Elizabeth Street Garden was going to do about 125 units of housing. 120 units. We're going to get 625</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 在经过多年的争论之后，在其他地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">units of housing. And we got elsewhere after years of fighting about it.</p>
</details>

是的。这就是纽约。让我们明确这座城市。无论你尝试做什么，我们有850万人口，我们有3500万种意见。你知道，无论你尝试做什么，总会有纽约人反对，但我们如何才能最好地利用这座城市？所以，我们考虑了伊丽莎白街花园的担忧。人们对此很担心。他们想保留花园，我说：“你必须给我一个计划，让我能够解决这座城市面临的头号危机，那就是住房。”我们成功地利用了那个空间，并额外获得了600多套经济适用房。无论你怎么说，这都是一场胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. This is New York. Let's let's be clear about this city. Wherever you try to do, we got 8.5 million people. We have 35 million opinions. You know, you always going to have New Yorkers, no matter what you attempt to do, but how do we leverage the best Florida city? So, we took the concerns of Elizabeth Street Garden. People were concerned about that. They wanted to hold on to the garden and I said, "You got to give me a plan that I could deal with the number one crisis I have in this city, and that is housing." and we were able to leverage that space and walk away with over 600 additional units of affordable housing. That's a win no matter how you how you how you talk about it.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 从那次经历中我们能得到什么普遍的教训？因为我们刚才谈到夜生活时，听起来社区团体和特殊利益团体仍然是您想做的一些事情的障碍。您是否考虑过采取什么措施来鼓励更多合作，建立“城市说‘是’”的理念？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the broad lesson from that experience? Because when we were talking about nightlife just then, you know, it sounds like community groups and special interest groups are still an impediment or an obstacle to some of the things that you seem to want to do. Is there anything you're thinking about to maybe like encourage more cooperation, build up that city of yes idea?</p>
</details>

是的。你知道我们在城市里，特别是在我们的民选官员身上看到了什么？我们的民选官员周一说住房是正确的，但周二他们说“不在我的选区”。我们不想听到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And you know what we witness in the city uh particularly in our elected officials? Our elected officials on Monday they say housing is right, but on Tuesday they say not in my district. We don't want to hear.</p>
</details>

如果我在过去三年零七个月中学到了什么，那就是你必须忽略噪音。你必须为城市的长期利益做最好的事情，这是一种回顾性的欣赏。如果你分析一下，不仅是住房，看看我在哪里远离了民主党领导层的噪音，当时我谈论将患有严重精神疾病的人从街上带走时，我遭到了难以置信的强烈反对。当我谈论投资警察部门时，其他人却在谈论削减警察经费。每个人都在反对，但现在我们看到犯罪率创纪录地下降。当我谈论大麻斗争时，我们必须对此做些什么。所以当你看看我当时所处的位置，即使在住房问题上，每个人都在反对“城市说‘是’”。而今天，所有人都回到了我们当时的位置。当你经历过这些，你就会有与众不同的视角。所以，我希望我的地方社区团体和组织能够理解，我们同在一个城市。但很多时候，人们说：“听着，我有我的后院。我有我的公园。我拥有我想要的一切。我不想有更多的人来这里。”但如果你这样做，你就会损害这座城市的长期计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if I walked away with anything in the last 3 years and seven months is that you have to ignore the noise. You have to do what's best long term for the city and it's a retrospective appreciation of and if you do an analysis not only in housing look how far I was away from where uh the noise of the leadership of Democratic party when I was take talking about taking uh severe mental health illness off our streets I got a unbelievable push back when I talk about investing in the police department when others were talking defund the police uh everyone was pushing back and now we see record levels of decrease and crime. Uh when I was talking about the cannabis fight uh that we had to do something about it. So when you look at where I was even in housing, everyone was pushing back on city of Yes. And today all came to where we were. And when you live these experiences, you have a different eyesight than others. And so uh what I want for my local community groups and organizations is to understand we're in the city together. And far too often, uh folks said that listen, I have my backyard. I have my park. I have all that I want. I don't want any additional people here. But if you do that, then you're going to hurt the long-term plan of this city.</p>
</details>

### 纽约市的负担能力：不仅仅是住房

**Joe Weisenthal:** 所以，您这次竞选的主要对手将负担能力作为其基石。您当然谈到了在您的政府领导下纽约市经济适用房的扩张，这是真实存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, your main opponent in this uh race has made affordability the sort of cornerstone. And you've talked about obviously the expansion of affordable housing in New York City under your administration, which is real.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 尽管如此，纽约市仍然是一个非常昂贵的生活地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nonetheless, New York City is a crazy expensive place to live.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我认为这很值得，因为我认为它是世界上最好的城市。所以，你知道，我会支付这里高昂的住房成本，因为我爱纽约市。但我们是否必须接受，就像您说的，纽约总会有850万居民的3500万种意见，这就是纽约市。我们是否都必须接受这座城市必须非常昂贵？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's worth it cuz I think it's the best city in the world. So, it's like, you know what? I'll pay the uh high cost of housing here because I love New York City. But do we just have to accept, you know, sort of in the same way you said, okay, you know, New York's always going to have 35 million opinions for 8.5 million residents. That's New York City. Do we just all have to accept that the city has to be incredibly expensive?</p>
</details>

不。不，我们不必。政府必须做的是利用其权力来帮助工薪阶层。当你思考这一点时，这正是我们所做的。我们向工薪阶层投入了300亿美元。我们研究了什么在推高成本。第一，正如我们所讨论的，经济适用房是一个领域。我们正在做这件事。我们正在建造它。我们正在打破纪录。第一年、第二年和第三年，我们每年建造的经济适用房都比历史上任何其他政府都要多。但看看其他领域。破产的首要原因是什么？医疗债务。我们正在免除低收入纽约人、寄养儿童的医疗债务，每年有600到700名儿童成年后离开寄养系统。他们被忽视了。他们没有得到应有的支持。我们正在支付他们的大学学费，并为他们提供生活教练，直到他们21岁，而不是18岁就离开，这样他们就不会被忽视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. No, we we don't. And what government must do is utilize their powers to help workingclass people. And when you think about it, that's what we have done. We put $30 billion back into workingclass people. And we looked at what is driving the cost. Number one, as we talked, affordable housing was one area. And we're doing that. We're building it. We break breaking records. Year 1, year two, and year three, we build more affordable housing individual years than any other administration in history. But look at the other areas. Uh what's the number one cause of bankruptcy? Medical debt. We are excusing medical debt for low-income New Yorkers, foster care children, 600 to 700 age out every year. They slip through the cracks. They don't get the support that they deserve. We're paying their college tuition and we're giving them life coaches until they're 21 instead of aging out at 18. So, they don't slip through the cracks.</p>
</details>

或者对女性，特别是家庭伤害最大的，是儿童保育。我们将儿童保育费用从每月220美元降至每月不到20美元。我们是20年来第一个提高**劳动所得税抵免**（Earned Income Tax Credit: EITC，一种针对低收入工薪家庭的税收抵免）的政府。我们正在为低收入住房和尼日尔（Niger）以及其他地方的低收入社区支付高速宽带费用。在此过程中，我们降低了低收入纽约人使用地铁系统的成本。所以真正的信息是，我无法控制面包的价格，但我可以把面包放回纽约人的口袋里。我们已经投入了300亿美元。所以，谈论那些市长控制范围之外的空中楼阁般的想法很容易，比如免费公交。免费公交需要30亿美元的成本。如果你声称你的计划基础是增加对前1%高收入者的税收，而实际上你没有权力这样做。你知道谁有权力吗？议员们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or what hurts women the most, but families in particular, child care. We dropped the cost of child care from $220 a week to less I a month to less than $20 a month. We were the first one in 20 years to drop the earning uh to increase the earned income tax credit. We're paying for highspeed broadband in lowincome housing in Niger and other uh low local in the process. Reduce the cost of using our subway system for lowincome New Yorkers. So the real message is I can't handle the price of bread, but I could put bread back in the pockets of New Yorkers. And we've done it at the sum of $30 billion. So it's easy to talk about pie in the sky ideas that that is not within the span of the control of the mayor like free buses. Free buses uh is a $3 billion price tag. And if you're stating that the foundation of your plan is based on increasing taxes on high 1% earnest when in fact you don't have the authority to do that. You know who has the authority? Assemblymen.</p>
</details>

我的对手是一名议员。如果他作为议员都无法做到，他作为市长又如何能做到呢？特别是当签署法案的州长明确表示她不会提高所得税时。纽约市的所得税是全国最高的。州的所得税也是全国最高的。所以，我所做的就是把钱放回人们的口袋里。你知道吗，由于我的“减税”（ax to tax）政策，低收入纽约人无需缴纳城市所得税。这就是你如何看待市长办公室的权力，并说：“我如何帮助工薪阶层？”他劫持了“工薪阶层市长”和“解决负担能力问题”的叙事，而我才是真正做到了的人，这让我感到震惊。我的记录清楚地表明，我把钱放回了工薪阶层人民的口袋里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My opponent is an assemblyman. If he couldn't get it done as the assemblyman, how is he going to get it done as a mayor? Particularly when the governor who signs off on it stated that she's not raising income taxes. New York City is the highest income tax in the country. The state is the highest in the country. And so what I did put money back in the pockets. Do you know there's no no income tax for low-income New Yorkers in the city because of my ax to tax? That is how you look at the power of the mayor's office and say, "How do I help workingclass people?" I'm blown away that he has hijacked the narrative of being a working-class mayor and putting money back in affordability issue when I've done it. That's my record is clear on putting money back in the pockets of working-class people.</p>
</details>

### 社会主义的定义与财富分配

**Joe Weisenthal:** 既然我们谈到了您的对手佐兰·姆达尼（Zoran Mdani）的政策，您曾说过纽约人不懂什么是社会主义。您能给我们您的社会主义定义吗？对您来说，社会主义是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since we're talking about your opponent's policies, Zoran Mdani, you've said that New Yorkers don't understand what socialism is. Can you give us your definition of socialism? Like what is socialism to you?</p>
</details>

好的，首先我会说，70%的纽约人喜欢社会主义的主题和概念。社会主义。如果你问很多人，他们会告诉你他们从未去过社会主义国家。我去过共产主义和社会主义国家。我去过委内瑞拉。我去过古巴。我知道配给券（Rational books）在哪里。我认为它的概念是，你将从人口的一个区域获取资金，并将其平均分配，许多政府运营的场所和设施，比如超市。现在，从概念上讲，这听起来不错。但如果你开设一家政府运营的超市，你就会扼杀**小杂货店**（bodega）行业。你将扼杀独立超市行业。所以我认为，相信资源应该从顶层获取的整个概念，那些认为这座城市不应该有任何亿万富翁的人，我认为这不平衡，因为当你看看税收来自哪里，以及如果你想用这个分类来分配财富，这对我来说行不通，也从未在世界任何地方行得通。我们无法指出一个国家说这个概念是成功的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first I would say this. 70% of New Yorkers like the theme and concept of socialism. Socialism. And many people if you were to ask uh they would tell you they never been to a socialist country. I've been to a communist and socialist country. I've been to Venezuela. I've been to Cuba. I know where Rational uh books are. Uh I think it is the concept that you're going to take uh money from one area of the population and equal it out across the board and many governmentrun loces and facilities such as supermarkets. Now, when you do that in in in concept, it sounds good. But if you open a governmentrun supermarket, you're gonna kill the bodega industry. you're going to kill the independent supermarket industries. So I think the whole concept of believing as though uh resources from the top end that those who believe that we should not have any billionaires in this city uh which I just don't it doesn't balance out because when you look at where the tax dollars come from and spreading spreading the wealth if you want to use that classification across the entire entire uh population that doesn't work for me has never worked anywhere on the globe. There's not one country we can point to that says that this concept has been successful.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我的意思是，我们确实有累进税。您刚才说低收入的纽约人不必缴纳纽约税。所以这里面确实有这方面的元素。那么，有没有一个点，它就变得太多了，或者说问题到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, we do have progressive taxes though. You just said that lower income New Yorkers don't have to pay New York tax. So, there is an element of that here. Like, is there a point at which it's too much or like what exactly is the issue?</p>

嗯，我想是这样。我认为需要一个平衡。我总是说，我希望开豪华轿车的人能获得公平的工资，并能够养家糊口。我也希望坐在豪华轿车后座的人能够自由支配他们的钱。当你看看这座城市里那些每个人都想妖魔化的亿万富翁时，他们是为我们的博物馆提供慈善捐款的人。他们是赞助像**罗宾汉基金会**（Robin Hood Foundation: 致力于扶贫的慈善组织）这样的机构，以帮助那些被忽视的人。他们的税款支付着我们的教师和消防员，以及那些经济条件较差的人。这种完美的金融生态系统正是让像纽约这样的城市变得伟大的原因。

<p class="english-text">Well, I I think so. I think there's a balance. And I like to say all the time, I want the person who drives the limousine to get a fair wage and be able to provide for his family. And I want the person that sits in the back seat of the limousine to be able to use his discretionary dollars or her discretionary dollars. When you look at the billionaires in this city that everyone wants to demonize, they're the ones who pay into their philanthropic actions into our museums. They're the ones that sponsor like the Robin Hood Foundation to deal with where people are slipping through the cracks. Uh they're the ones in their tax dollars are paying for our teachers and our firefighters and those who are on the low economic end. That perfect financial ecosystem is what makes a city like this great.</p>

所以，如果你的立场是，特别是在现在你可以在城市之外运营你的组织和实体的情况下，你可以轻易地去康涅狄格州、新泽西州或迈阿密，我们已经失去了大量高收入者。如果你的立场是“我们不希望你留在这座城市”，理想情况下，听到“我们要摆脱所有亿万富翁”对人们很有吸引力。但当你深入研究数据时，这些亿万富翁正在维持城市的运转。正因为我们有亿万富翁，我们才能为工薪阶层减税。

If your position is we don't want you here in our city, ideally that's attractive to people to hear we're getting rid of all the billionaires. But when you drill down in the numbers, those billionaires are keeping the lights on. And because we have billionaires, we're able to do things like ask the tax for the working class.</p>

### 联邦关系、移民问题与“深层政府”

**Joe Weisenthal:** 回到您之前说的一些话，您谈到了联邦资金、联邦对**NYCHA**（New York City Housing Authority: 纽约市房屋管理局）公共住房的支持。纽约市的任何市长，当前，市长是否应该与特朗普（Trump）保持对立关系？很多人都希望这样。很多人希望市长在某种程度上成为对抗特朗普政策的堡垒。您显然受益于他或他的司法部撤销了对您的指控。在**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）在赖克斯岛（Rikers）的合作方面也有合作。您如何看待这种关系，无论是对市民还是无证居民，纽约市的这种“去妖魔化”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Going back to something you said earlier, you're talking about federal funding, federal support for NICHA, the public housing. Should any mayor of New York City currently um should the mayor have a oppositional relationship with Trump? A lot of people want that. A lot of people want the mayor to stand as a bull work to some extent against Trump's policy. You obviously uh benefited from the fact that he uh dropped charges or his DOJ dropped charges against you. There's been cooperation uh in terms of ICE on Rikers. How do you think about the fact that whether you know this sort of sort of uh yeah dempifying New York City for both the citizens and also undocumented residents? You know, the most dangerous thing that being a mayor mayor during this time is people read headlines and not the full scope, you know, and that's unfortunate.</p>
</details>

你知道，作为市长，在这个时代最危险的事情是人们只看标题，而不是全面了解情况，你知道，这很不幸。当你思考时，有时一个谎言说得足够久，它就会变成真相。当你看看我与现任总统的关系定义时，每个人都在忽视我与拜登总统的关系。我称自己为布鲁克林的拜登。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, when you think about it, sometimes you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth. And when you look at the definition of the relationship I I have with the current president, everyone is ignoring the relationship I have with President Biden. I call myself the Biden of Brooklyn. Everyone</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我看过那个视频。我看到那个片段了。我看了大概10遍。

我必须……因为我们有良好的关系，我喜欢这位总统。我是否相信他的政府中有人参与了**法律战**（lawfare: 利用法律系统作为武器进行政治或军事斗争）？他实际上说过。他说他的司法部在他赦免儿子时被政治化了。他知道那里发生了什么。但拜登来到这座城市，和我一起度过了一整天，当时我正在处理执法问题，我们没有**ATF**（Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: 烟酒枪炮及爆炸物管理局）的负责人，没有人负责烟酒枪炮。他任命了一个人，他访问了我的危机管理团队。他坐下来和我谈论打击暴力，这是我竞选时的主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">times. I'll have to uh because we had a good relationship and I like the president. Do I believe there were those in his administration that participated in lawfare? He actually said it. He said his justice department uh was politicized when he pardoned his son. He knew what was happening there. But Biden came to the city and spent the whole day with me when I was dealing with law enforcement issues and we didn't have an ATF head, someone to be in charge of the uh alcoh alcohol, tobacco um and firearms. And he appointed someone, he visited my crisis management teams. He sat down and spoke with me about going after violence, which was the issue that I ran on.</p>
</details>

所以对这位总统来说也是一样。我以前不认识唐纳德·特朗普。很多人没有意识到这一点。我直到在阿尔弗雷德·E·史密斯晚宴（Alfred E. Smith dinner）上见到他才认识他，他和我交谈了。他在竞选期间，甚至在我见到他之前，就说他们对纽约市的这位市长所做的事情是错误的。他看到了正在发生的事情，当他上任时，我所说的关于危险移民和寻求庇护者的事情，在大选前我就在说，大选后我还在说。当我在选举日走出投票站，麦克风对着我的脸，他们问：“你投给了谁？”我说：“副总统哈里斯（VP Harris）。”我非常清楚。你知道，我是否不同意我所看到的民主党正在做的事情？是的。但我仍然忠于做我认为正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the same to goes to for this president. I didn't know Donald Trump. A lot of people don't realize that. I didn't know him until I met him at the uh Alfred E. Smith dinner and he spoke with me. He was on the campaign trail prior to even meeting me saying it's wrong what they doing to this mayor uh in New York in New York City. And he he saw what was happening and when he came into office, the same things I was saying about dangerous migrants and asylum seekers pre-election, I was saying post election. And when I walked out of the voting booth on election day and the microphone was in my face and they said, "Who did you vote for?" I said, "VP Harris." I was very clear. You know, did I disagree with what I saw the Democratic party was doing? Yes. But I still remained uh loyal to do what was what I thought was right to do.</p>
</details>

所以当你快进到今天，我们起诉政府的次数比全国任何其他市长都多。没有其他市长像我一样，在反对政策方面，起诉政府的次数如此之多。但是，当我们美国总统需要关注我们在日落公园或温德福尔（Windfall）的一个项目时，数十亿美元的投资，50万套住房将使用能源，1500个工会工作岗位。我飞到华盛顿，与总统坐下来，说：“总统先生，我们不能让这个项目被毁掉。”他解除了停工令。那个项目现在正在推进。这就是大城市市长应该做的事情。现在，我可以在角落里生闷气，只是骂总统，说：“好吧，你知道吗？人们对选举结果感到不满。”但这对纽约有什么帮助？这如何帮助纽约沟通协调，去追捕危险人物？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you fast forward to today, u we took the administration to court more than any other mayor in the country. No other mayor has gone to court as much as I have pushing back on the policies. But when we needed the president of the United States to look at a project we had in Sunset Park or Windfall, billions of dollars investment of 500,000 homes were going to use the energy 1,500 union jobs. I flew to Washington and sat down with the president and said, "Mr. President, we can't have this this this project destroyed." He lifted the stop work order. That project is now moving forward. That's what mayors of big cities are supposed to do. Now, I can pout in the corner and just call the president names and say, "Well, you know what? People are upset over the outcome of the election." But how does that help New York?</p>
</details>

我们城市里有危险的委内瑞拉帮派。他们强迫移民和无证女性卖淫。我与联邦当局协调。我们逮捕了27名帮派成员。我们能够以非法持枪和其他危险罪行逮捕他们。所以，作为美国最大城市的市长，我的职责是与总统坐下来，而不是与总统开战，而是与总统合作，为这座城市的人民服务。

<p class="english-text">How does it help New York to communicate and coordinate to go after dangerous people? We have a We had dangerous Venezuelan gangs in the city.

So, it is my job as the mayor of the biggest city in America to sit down and not war with the president, but work with the president to deliver for the people of this city.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这是一个完美的过渡，让我问一个可能看起来有点随意，但实际上我认为很相关的问题，因为您之前曾建议纽约人应该阅读卡什·帕特尔（Cash Patel）的《关于深层政府的一切》（All About the Deep State）一书。

完全没有。我不知道他的顾问、安保人员是否建议了其他做法，或者时机问题，我完全不知道。我期待看到美国有这么多深层秘密，我想我们都想知道，而且我们必须尽可能多地找出真相。我想谈谈卡什（Cash）的书，我认为那是一本好书。人们嘲笑“深层政府”（deep state）这个词。但确实如此，政府中有些人，他们经历了多位总统、多位市长、多位州长，他们非常傲慢。他们认为自己是民选官员。他们认为他们不需要向任何人负责。他们认为他们能够阻挠他们不喜欢的项目。我作为市长亲身经历过。他们与记者有联系。他们与检察官有联系，他们能够在一分钟内给你写一封信。他们能在一分钟内让你被报道，并泄露消息。我看到了它是如何运作的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Not at all. Uh I don't know if his advisers security personnel uh advised otherwise or timing I don't I have no idea. Uh I look forward to seeing there's so many deep secrets in America that I think we all want to know and it's imperative that as much as we can find out as possible and I want to talk about cash C cash's book which I thought was a good book. Uh people laugh at the terminology of a deep state. Uh but it is we have people in government who have been in government through presidents through mayors through governors and they're very arrogant. They believe they are the elected. They believe they answer to no one. They believe that they are able to hold up projects that they don't like. And I saw that firsthand uh as the mayor. And they're connected to reporters. They're connected to uh prosecutors and they're connected to be able to they write a letter on you in a minute. They get a story planted on in a minute and leaks. And I saw it and how it operates.</p>
</details>

现在请思考一下。每个人都忽略了这一点。纽约南区（Southern District of New York）将自己归类为“主权实体”。我的意思是，我们真的需要思考一下，作为主权实体。美国没有主权实体。每个人都要向某人负责。如果你认为你不需要向任何人报告，即使是司法部，你也可以为所欲为。这是不可接受的。这应该激怒每一个美国人，任何拥有如此检察权力的实体，都能真正扰乱你的生活。你知道，人们没有读我的起诉书。我被起诉是因为打电话给消防局，要求他们进行建筑检查，而不是通过……

<p class="english-text">Now think about this for a moment. Everybody let it go over their head. The Southern District of New York classified themselves as sovereign.

And that should outrage every American that any entity with that level of prosecutoal power that can really disrupt your life. You know, people didn't read my indictment. I was indicted for calling the fire department asking them to do a building inspection, not to pass</p>

我竞选时的主张是让**FDNY**（Fire Department of New York: 纽约市消防局）回应那些无法开业的企业。他们将其与“你支付旅行费用时有很多升级”联系起来，现在我们要把它变成贿赂，我们要让你坐33年牢。拜托。

Come on.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我想回到**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）一会儿。我完全理解您关于暴力罪犯以及无论他们是否移民都需要处理的观点。但显然，你知道，全国各地都在发生ICE突袭，包括针对非暴力但无证移民的突袭。纽约市作为**庇护城市**（sanctuary city: 限制与联邦移民执法机构合作的城市）有着悠久的历史。抛开暴力犯罪分子不谈，您在多大程度上倾向于与政府合作处理非暴力无证移民？这在未来，至少在特朗普政府的剩余任期内，大概会继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to go back to uh ICE for a second. I take your point absolutely about violent criminals and the need to address them whether they're uh migrants or not. But obviously, you know, there's ICE raids happening across the country, including nonviolent but undocumented migrants. New York City has a long history of being a self-desated sanctuary city. M setting aside the sort of violent criminal element, what is the degree to which you know this is going to continue presumably going forward at least through the rest of the Trump administration. What is the degree to which you're inclined to cooperate with the administration on nonviolent undocumented migrants?</p>
</details>

我们非常清楚，正如你所提到的，这座城市是一个庇护城市，并且要明白庇护城市不是法律。它是我们这座城市所信仰的信念。如果你在纽约，你买了一瓶水并为此纳税，这些税款用于你的商品和服务。所以，在这座城市，无论你是否有证件，我们都不会质疑你。如果你需要，你可以获得医疗援助。你的孩子可以上学。如果你是犯罪的受害者，你可以报警。你可以确保你可以在纽约市的街道上行走。这就是我们整个信仰体系。我们绝不会在民事执法方面与ICE合作或协作。这违反了法律。我们从未这样做过，也永远不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't we're very clear and as you mentioned this city is a sanctuary city and understand sanctuary city is not a law. It is a belief that we believe in this city. If you're in New York and you buy a bottle of water and you pay taxes on that, those taxes go to your goods and services. So, in this city, if you are documented or not, we don't question you on that. You could go get medical assistance if you need it. Your child will be able to go to school. You can call the police if you're a victim of a crime. You could make sure that you could walk the streets of the city of New York. And that is what our entire belief system is. We will never cooperate or collaborate with ICE on civil enforcement. That is against the law. We never done and we never will.</p>
</details>

但当涉及到刑事执法时，我们会与他们协调，因为我们必须非常清楚这一点，我认为这一点被扭曲了。ICE不是一个犯罪组织。人们可以不喜欢。我不喜欢**IRS**（Internal Revenue Service: 美国国税局）从我口袋里拿钱，但它仍然是一个联邦机构，它需要确保我们的税款被征收和使用。ICE不是一个犯罪组织。ICE是一个联邦执法机构。我们的城市已经决定，他们的一些职责我们不允许合作。我们尊重这一点，我们永远不会。但当涉及到维护这座城市的安全时，我将与执法机构、**HSI**（Homeland Security Investigations: 国土安全调查局）、**FBI**（Federal Bureau of Investigation: 联邦调查局）、ICE合作。这些帮派极其危险。还有其他人在这个城市犯下了真正的罪行。我不在乎你是否有证件。在执法部门工作了22年之后，我将保护纽约人的安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We will coordinate with them when it comes down to criminal enforcement because we need to be very clear on this and I think this has been distorted. ICE is not a criminal organization. People could dislike. I don't like the IRS taking money out of my pockets, but it's still a federal agency and it's needed to make sure our tax dollars are collected and spent. ICE is not a criminal organization. ICE is a federal law enforcement agency. Our city has determined that parts of their duties we are not allowed to collaborate with. We respect that and we never will. But I'm going to collaborate with law enforcement agencies, HSI, FBI, ICE, uh, when it comes down to keeping this city safe. These gangs were extremely dangerous. And you had others who were committing real crimes in this city. And I don't care if you're documented or undocumented. After 22 years of being in the law enforcement community, I'm going to keep New Yorkers safe.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但ICE对犯罪的定义基本上包括了任何非法入境的人，对吗？这就是问题所在。他们没有区分帮派成员、暴力罪犯和那些只是想工作的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But isn't ISIS's definition of a crime that includes basically anyone who entered the country illegally? Right. That's the problem. They're not distinguishing between gang members, violent criminals, and people that, you know, are just trying to work.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't collaborate on that. Okay.</p>
</details>

因为我们的法律明确规定，某些甚至那种性质的犯罪我们都不会合作。所以当涉及到那种程度的犯罪时，我们不会合作。我们非常清楚我们会在哪些方面合作。但我也想指出这一点，因为它经常被忽视。我总是被麦克风对着脸，问：“嘿，埃里克，你打算怎么处理ISIS（这里应指ICE，口误）正在做的事情？”那是一个联邦机构。我认为我们正在让我们的联邦民选官员逃避责任。我无法控制联邦机构的规则。我没有……我拥有市议会。我的工作是审查法律并签署他们的法律。你知道，我们对联邦伙伴的要求不够。嘿，伙计们，你们对此做了什么？那不是我的工作。移民执法是联邦权力，而不是城市权力。我将做好我的工作。我无法控制谁越过边境。我控制的是当他们越过边境时，谁在城市里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because it's clear in our law that uh certain even crimes of that nature we will not collaborate in. And so when it comes down to that level of crimes we will not collaborate. We're very clear on what we will collaborate. But I also want to point this out because it's often ignored. I'm off uh someone is always pointing a mic in my face and saying hey Eric what are you what are you going to do about u what um ISIS doing? That's a federal agency. I think we're get we're allowing our federal electors off the hook. I don't control the rules of the federal agencies. I don't have I I I have the city council. That's my job to look at laws to sign their laws. You know, we're not asking our federal partners enough. Hey guys, what are you doing about this? That's not my job.

I control who's in the city when they are across the border.</p>

我告诉过拜登总统这一点。我说：“听着，我们有一个最糟糕的边境。”我去了埃尔帕索（El Paso）。我去了达连隘口（Darian Gap），去了厄瓜多尔、哥伦比亚、墨西哥，我看到了人流，我看到了他们如何告诉人们纽约的街道铺满了黄金。我们为什么不控制人流？我们全国各地都有严重的人口问题。我们应该允许人们进入这个国家，然后说：“嘿，肯塔基州需要赛马业的后勤工人。你在这里待三年，然后你可以在全国任何地方去你想去的地方。”如果我们处理得更好，这将是一个双赢的局面。我们对边境没有控制。我们允许任何人通过。现在我们看到大幅减少，我们不再每周有4000人进入这座城市，这是不可持续的。

We should be allowing people to come into the country and say, "Hey, Kentucky need backstretch workers in the racing industry. Here's where you're going for three years and then you could go wherever you want in the country." This is a win-win if we handle it better. We had no control at the border. We were allowing anyone to come through. Now that we see a substantial decrease, we're no longer get longer getting 4,000 people a week into this into this city, which was just not sustainable.</p>

我仍然会在凌晨1点、2点在街上巡逻，当我看到营地或溢出的垃圾时，我会打电话给我的局长们，他们都会告诉你那些他们接到我的可怕电话，因为我们应该在你看到之前就看到它。你值得拥有一个干净的洗手间。你值得去一个没有垃圾的公园。你值得不必担心老鼠从你脚边跑过。你知道，这是你应得的。这些是我们应得的基本东西。但我们必须首先处理第一层问题，处理让我们摆脱新冠疫情，处理犯罪，然后是处理移民和寻求庇护者的意外危机。你知道，人们总是告诉我们：“好吧，埃里克，你把移民寻求庇护者留在了身后。一切都好。”不是这样的。我们花了77亿美元。其中5亿美元本应用于长期缺课的儿童。10亿美元本应用于为我们的老年人建造住房。10亿美元本应用于确保我们提升我们的环卫部门。我想说的是，我们所经历的长期影响将对我们的城市产生长期影响。

你知道，我讨厌看到有人在街上“打盹”（nodding），正是如此。当我看到有人……我们前几天在枢纽站。那里一片狼藉，直到我们进去并仔细检查。我们设立了我们称之为“路径团队”（path team）和“侦察团队”（scout teams）。我在地铁系统里花了很多时间，目标是如何劝说人们离开系统？现在，我们已经成功地将8500名住在我们系统里的人带离了系统。但我无法告诉你，处理那些患有严重精神健康问题的人是多么大的挑战。他们不知道自己需要护理。这就是为什么我试图让奥尔巴尼（Albany）通过非自愿移除法案，因为有些人对自己和他人有害，我们必须把他们带到室内。我们必须把他们带到室内。很多人在这个问题上与我存在哲学上的分歧。我想说，如果你正在吸毒，我们需要把你带到室内。如果你在零下30度的天气里，你没有穿鞋，你知道，你的衣服破烂，你还在大喊大叫。我们现在必须劝说他们，并希望他们在建立信任之后，侦察团队正在做着出色的工作，但这需要更长的时间，你会看到那些屡次犯错的人一次又一次地出现。但我们的目标是追捕，在公共场所注射毒品是违法的。但当你真正严厉打击时，你会受到很多指责，说我们正在将毒品犯罪化，因为毒品，你知道，成瘾是一种疾病。所以我们正在努力找到正确的平衡，但我们比其他人希望我们做的更多地接触这些人。我们收到了很多投诉，因为我们接触了那些给自己注射毒品的人，那些患有严重精神疾病的人。我必须忽略这些噪音，为了城市整体的公共安全。

But I cannot tell you how much a challenge it is dealing with people who uh dealing with severe mental health issues. They don't know they need care. Uh that is why I was trying to get Albany to pass the involuntary removal bill because there are people who are harmful to themselves and harmful to others and we have to take them inside.

### 旅游业、酒店发展与政治竞选

**Joe Weisenthal:** 纽约市的酒店价格高得离谱。部分原因似乎是现有酒店业主和工会都反对酒店扩张。此外，你也不能做爱彼迎（Airbnb），但这不重要。我不太关心那个。当你思考纽约市的活力时，你有什么愿景来打破这种僵局，还是我们必须接受，无论城市如何发展，我们接待游客的能力都将受到限制，因为我们无法建造任何新酒店？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hotel prices in New York City are insane. And part of it seems to be this sort of opposition to hotel expansion both from the owners of existing hotels and from unions. Also, you can't do Airbnb, but whatever. I I care less about that. When you think about like the vitality of New York City, like do you have any vision like how to break this impass or do we just have to accept that as much as the city is going to grow that the number of the capacity for our ability to take in tourism is just going to be sort of capped by our inability to build any new hotels?</p>
</details>

我们需要建造更多，我们正处于疫情前的水平。我们的酒店业表现良好。我想你知道，去年有6500万游客来到这里。这里仍然是热门地点。人们仍然……

**Joe Weisenthal:** 从旅游业的角度来看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this summer from tourism perspective?</p>
</details>

没有达到我们以前的水平。我认为一些关于关税的讨论，一些对话影响了我们的旅游业，特别是我们的一些国内游客。我们过去有很多来自加拿大的游客，但我们从未真正恢复到应有的水平，我们的亚洲市场。中国人是我们旅游业的重要组成部分，但我们会反弹的。我们在新冠疫情期间受到了打击，但在疫情后我们得以恢复，这仍然是一个好产品。你知道，人们想来这里。我喜欢这里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Not as not the levels we have. I think some of the conversation around tariffs, some of the conversations um impacted our uh tourism, particularly some of our domestic tourists. We used to get a lot of tourists from uh Canada and we never really recovered the way we should have our our Asian market. Chinese were they were a major part of our tourism, but we're going to we're going to bounce back. We had a we had a hit during COVID and we were able to recover after CO and this is still a good product. You know, people want to come here. I love it here.</p>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. How do we get more rooms though?</p>

<p class="english-text">That's the goal. We got to build more. We have to encourage more uh building.

</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这可能是我最重要的问题，也是我一直想知道的，我们时代的一个巨大谜团。但在准备这次采访的过程中，乔和我看了很多您以前的采访和视频。我看了您著名的违禁品视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is my most important one possibly and something I've always wondered um a great mystery of our times. But in the course of prepping for this interview, Joe and I watched a lot of your previous interviews, your previous videos. I was watching your famous contraband video.</p>
</details>

嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 你到底是从哪里弄来一个用过的**吸毒管**（crackpipe: 用于吸食可卡因的烟斗），作为那个视频的道具的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where in the world did you get a used crackpipe to use as a prop in that video?</p>
</details>

那是……实际上我打算重新制作那个视频，使其现代化。当我第一次制作那个视频时，对于那些不知道的人来说，那是一个展示你如何在孩子的房间里寻找毒品的视频。当我第一次制作那个视频时，直到今天，人们会说：“哦，你知道，你怎么能那样做？这对孩子太苛刻了。”你知道，很多人不知道，如果有人在你家里贩毒，当警察来突袭时，每个人都会被带走，奶奶、爷爷、孩子都会被送去**ACS**（Administration for Children's Services: 儿童服务管理局），家庭会被破坏，我们需要掌控我们的家园。现在，这可能不会发生在你家里，你知道，在你家里，你甚至不必担心，或者我可能不必担心我的孩子乔丹。但当你去许多暴力猖獗、毒品泛滥的内城时。当我们制作那个视频时，人们给我的回应是：“哇，我不知道。”所以当时那个破裂的吸毒管，我制作视频时，它几乎无处不在。就像你在某些社区看到的那样，你会看到针头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That that was and actually I'm going remake that video to modern times. Uh when I did that first video, for those who who are not aware, it was a video showing how you should look in your child's room for drugs. When I did the first video and still today, uh people say, "Oh, you know, how can you do that? That's hard on children." You know many people don't know that if someone is selling drugs in your home when the police come they they come in and do a raid everyone goes grandmother grandfather children go to ACS families are disrupted and we need to take control of our homes now it may not be in your home you know in your home this is something that you don't have to even worry about or possibly I don't have to worry about it with Jordan my child but when you go to many of the inner cities with violent is rampant and drugs are pervasive. Uh when we did that video, the number of responses people gave me was like, no, wow, I didn't know that. And so that that broke crack pike back then when I did it, it was just about everywhere. Like you see in certain communities, you see uh needles that</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 天哪。好的，最后一个问题。很多人给安德鲁·科莫（Andrew Cuomo）捐了很多钱，但在初选中他完全失败了。您还在竞选，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my gosh. Okay, last question. A bunch of people threw gave Andrew Como tons of money and it came up totally short in the primary. You're still running. Yes.</p>
</details>

A，如果您的民调排名第四或第三，您会考虑在九月退出吗？B，考虑到这些钱在民主党初选中似乎毫无作用，为什么还有人应该向您的竞选活动或您的**超级政治行动委员会**（Super PAC: 一种可以无限量地从个人、公司、工会和其他团体那里筹集和支出资金的政治委员会）捐款？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A, would you consider in September dropping out if you're fourth in the polls or third in the polls? And B, why should anyone donate to your campaign or your uh super PAC given how ineffective those dollars seem to be in the Democratic primary?</p>
</details>

嗯，它并非无效。我们在上次申报中筹集了150万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it wasn't in ineffective. Uh we in the last filing we were raised 1.5 million.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，给科莫的钱完全无效，因为他惨败了。那么，为什么在这种环境下，人们还会觉得任何政治捐款会有用呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, the money given to Cuomo was totally ineffective because he got trounced. So why should anyone feel that any political giving is going to be useful in this environment?</p>
</details>

金钱很重要。这很不幸。我可能是唯一一位一再声明我们应该彻底将金钱从政治中剔除的民选官员。我们应该给每位候选人一个固定的金额。他们只能花费那个金额，仅此而已。我们没有理由打电话给个人要求捐款。但这就是现实的本质。所以当你看看它时，这些钱被用于重要的原因，因为电视广告非常昂贵。你的员工需要工资等等。他不是因为资金短缺而失败的。他失败是因为他不想当市长。纽约市市长不是一个安慰奖。你知道，你辞去州长职务，然后有一天醒来说：“好吧，我想得到一个安慰奖，竞选纽约市市长。”这很明显。你周末不出来。你不做这些。你不坐下来参加播客或采访。你活在一个泡沫里。他一直活在一个泡沫里。州长的儿子后来成为司法部长，又成为州长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And money is important. It's unfortunate. I am probably the only elected official that has stated over and over again, we need to take money out of politics completely. We should give a dollar amount to every candidate. They can only spend that dollar amount and that's it. There's no reason we should be calling up individuals asking for money. But that's the nature of the beast. And so when you look at it, those month those dollars are are used for important reasons because television is extremely expensive. Your your staff is cost money, etc. The he didn't lose because of of the shortage of dollars. He used he lost because he did not want to be mayor. Mayor New York City is not a consolation prize. You know, you step down as governor and then you wake up one day and you say, "Okay, I want to do a consolation prize and run to be the mayor of the city of New York." And it was obvious. You don't come out on weekends. You don't do this. Don't sit down to speak on podcasts or interviews. You live in a bubble. He always lived in a bubble. Governor's son went on to become AG, went on to become governor.</p>
</details>

还有另一种模式，很多人都在忽视。他对黑人男性民选官员的看法。没有人愿意谈论这个。他对卡尔·麦考尔（Carl McCall）就是这样。当卡尔·麦考尔竞选第一位黑人州长时，安德鲁·科莫（Andrew Cuomo）也加入了竞选，破坏了他的竞选活动。他对查理·金（Charlie King）也是这样。查理·金当时正在竞选司法部长，筹集了500万美元，是主要候选人之一。他介入，把查理·金挤走了。他对大卫·帕特森（David Patterson）也是这样。大卫当时准备竞选连任。他决定破坏他的竞选活动，把他赶走了。现在他正试图对我做同样的事情。就像你说的，你的听众需要真正了解发生了什么。我以独立候选人身份参选。每个人都知道我以独立候选人身份参选。每个人都认为我这样做很愚蠢，不明白唯一以独立身份赢得市长选举的是城市市长。我们知道姆达尼（Mdani）将以鲁肯斯家族（Rookens family）的名义出现在大选选票上。如果安德鲁在初选中，他为什么要把自己的名字扔进去？他这样做是因为他认为他可以遵循他长期以来所做的同样的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there's another pattern that a lot of people are ignoring. Uh what he feels about black men who are elected. Nobody wants to talk about this. He did it to K McCall. When Carl McCoy ran to be the first black governor, Andrew Cuomo got in the race, uh, sabotaged his campaign. He did it to Charlie King. Charlie King was running to be attorney general, raised $5 million, was one of the leading candidates. He got in, pushed Charlie King out. He did it to David Patterson. David was going to run for reelection. He decided to sabotage his campaign and moved him out. Now he's trying to do the same thing for me. And like you said, your audience needs to really understand what happened. I ran for independent. Everyone knew I was running for independent. Everybody thought I was foolish for doing so, not understanding that the only mayors that have won on the independent line was city mayors. We knew that Mandani was going to be on the general election ballot on the Rookens family line. Why did Andrew throw his name into it if he was in the primary? He did it because he was thought he could follow the same process that he's done for a long time.</p>
</details>

所以，让我们看看民意调查。民意调查显示他领先40个百分点。40个百分点。他在选举前一天通过他的工作人员发布了一份民意调查，显示他领先10个百分点。他输了13个百分点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's look at the polls. The polls had him up for 40 points. 40 points. He sent out a poll through his uh staffers the day before the election that he was up 10 points. He lost by 13 points.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

在我的政治生涯中，我从未见过如此强大的“阻止姆达尼运动”的能量，它来自我的杂货店老板、我的小业主、我的犹太社区、我的前苏联和前社会主义黑人选民，他们现在都在这里说他们不想倒退。所以我之前说过，如果你看看一些旧录像带，我说这将是这座城市历史上最激动人心的市长竞选。我在7岁时就知道，在政治报道中。

So I said it before, if you look at some of the old tapes, I said this is going to be the most exciting mayoral race in the history of this city. I knew it in um 7 covering politics.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 没错。民主党初选之夜您在哪里？当姆达尼（Mum Donnie）获胜时，您的反应是什么？您是否觉得：“哦，我预料到了，因为您刚才列举的所有原因，如果我试图思考，我想我当时在床上睡觉。我知道结果会是什么。我在初选前6个月就说过姆达尼会赢。”

I said 6 months before the primary that Madani was going to win."</p>
</details>

嗯，我只需要早起。是的，城里有事情要做，或者我想那天有暴风雨。我可能一直在城里巡视一些受灾地点。你知道，你总是用体育来打比方。你知道，我拥有王冠，而安德鲁（Andrew）竟然会告诉第二位在任市长，第二位有色人种市长，我应该为他让路。我的意思是，那是最高级别的傲慢，你知道，在我最困难的时刻。新冠疫情、移民、寻求庇护者、法律战。我没有退缩。我挺身而出。我说我被选来为这座城市服务。无论我必须面对什么，我都会履行我的承诺。他没有这样做。当情况变得艰难时，他离开了。他放弃了他对纽约市的责任。我绝不会对这座城市这样做。我作为警察时没有放弃它。我作为市长也不会放弃它。

Uh, you know, uh, I have the crown and just the thought that Andrew is going to tell the second sitting mayor, second mayor of color that I should step aside for him. I mean, that's the highest level of arrogance, you know, during my difficult moments. COVID, migrants, asylum seeker, law affair. I didn't step down. I stepped up. I I said I was elected to serve this city. No matter what I had to face, I was going to live up to my commitment. He didn't do that. When it got hot, he left.

<p class="english-text">Tracy, I'm glad we finally got a chance to speak to the mayor. I've never talked to uh never talked to him before.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 不，我也没说过。我很享受这种转变。我确实认为纽约是一个非常有趣的培养皿，可以尝试许多经济政策，它巩固了我们多年来一直在讨论的许多趋势，包括经济适用房、税收等。我喜欢您提出的问题，即累进税何时会变成社会主义的魔力界限，对吗？我实际上认为，这对很多人来说都是一个问题，包括曼尼（Manny）等人，比如，到底什么构成了可接受或理想的再分配水平，因为显然，市长亚当斯（Mayor Adams）谈到社会主义在各地都失败了，正如他所断言的，然而纽约市的一个重要元素是富裕纽约人筹集的资金，正如他所说，将钱放回人们的口袋，使城市更具负担能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh no, neither have I. I am enjoying this transition. I do think it's a really interesting New York is obviously a really interesting petri dish in which to experiment with a lot of economic policies and it sort of solidifies a lot of the trends we've been talking about over the years including affordable housing, taxation, things like that. I liked your question about when is there some magic line from which progressive taxation becomes socialism, right? And I actually think like this is a question for a lot of people including Manny etc. like is there like what actually like constitutes like an acceptable or an ideal level of redistribution because obviously you know uh Mayor Adams was talking about you know socialism has has failed everywhere as as as he asserted and yet an important element of New York City is the money that is uh raised from wealthy New Yorkers to as he put it you know put a put money back into people's pockets to make the city more affordable</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 对，所以目前这是可选的，亿万富翁可以选择这样做。但我的意思是，如果你认为这是一件好事，那么为什么不让它变得，你知道，在更高的层面上，也许是强制性的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right so at the moment that's optional billionaires can choose to do it. But I mean, if you think it's a good thing, then why not make it, you know, potentially maybe mandatory at some higher level maybe,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 对吗？为什么必须只是亿万富翁？因为也有很多不是亿万富翁但也很富有的人，而每个人都只谈论亿万富翁，我认为这是这场对话的一个重要元素。你知道，我确实认为，在某种程度上，城市的一些弊病被认为是“这就是纽约市”，因为这就是现实，这就是你所做的。所以，就像，这些就是成本。所以，当然，要花很多年才能弄清楚我们是否要使用一块有争议的特定土地并将其变成住房。当然，会有一定程度的公共吸毒和老鼠，尽管老鼠已经减少了，还有破损的洗手间等等。在讨论中，我们似乎只是接受了，因为这是纽约市，所以有些事情就是会低于标准或积极地具有敌意。
