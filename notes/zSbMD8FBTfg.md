### 梦境的生理基础

**Karen van Kampen**: 梦境相当复杂，其中包含情感和视觉成分，这有助于我们理解大脑的哪些部分与做梦有关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Dreams are quite complex. There's emotion. There's visual components to help us understand what parts of the brain are affiliated with dreaming.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 大脑的不同部分在睡眠周期的不同时间会活跃起来。在做梦时活跃的大脑区域之一是您大脑的情感中心，也就是帮助处理我们情感的那些部分。**前额叶皮层**（prefrontal cortex）在**快速眼动睡眠**（REM sleep）期间的活跃度低于我们清醒时。而前额叶皮层正是负责决策和理性思考的部分，在 REM 睡眠期间它的活跃度较低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So different parts of the brain are active at different times in the sleep cycle. One part of the brain that's active during dreaming is the emotional centre of your brain. So the parts of the brain that help process emotions that are involved in our feelings, the prefrontal cortex. During REM sleep, it's less active than when we're awake. And that's the part of the brain that really deals with making decisions, thinking rationally. And that's less active during REM.

</details>

### 睡眠周期与梦境阶段

**Karen van Kampen**: 您提到了 REM 和周期。REM 的简单解释就是快速眼动睡眠。然后还有非快速眼动睡眠。您提到了我们在哪些周期会做梦。我们怎么知道呢？你知道有眼球运动，这是非常明显的。当我们谈论“我们怎么知道那是我们做梦的地方”时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: All right. You mentioned REM and you mentioned cycle. So REM to simplify rapid eye movement. And then there is non-rapid eye movement. You mentioned which cycles we dream in. How do we know. You know there's eye movement that's very clear. And when we talk about how do we know that's where we dream.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我们通过非 REM 和 REM 睡眠做梦。非 REM 睡眠包括第一到第三阶段。第一、二、三阶段是非 REM 睡眠。而 REM 睡眠是第四阶段。所以我们实际上在整个睡眠周期、整晚都在做梦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So we dream through non-REM and REM. So non-REM sleep is stages one through three. Stages one, two and three is non-REM sleep. And REM sleep is stage four. So we actually dream all through the sleep cycle, all through the night. So that's.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 那些是最好、最生动的梦境吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Where the best, most vivid dreams.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: REM 睡眠。所以通常我们最强烈、最生动、最富含情感的梦境发生在 REM 睡眠期间。我们会在大约入睡 90 分钟后进入第一个 REM 阶段。我们每晚会经历 4 到 5 个睡眠周期阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: REM sleep. So it's typically our most intense, vivid emotional dreams happen during REM and we get to our first REM. We go through 4 or 5 stages of the sleep cycle a night. And so we get it's about 90 minutes into the sleep cycle that we have our first period of REM.

</details>

### 童年经历与梦境科学的启蒙

**Karen van Kampen**: 好的，读您的书，我发现您拥有相当不寻常的童年经历，是什么让您对睡眠和梦境产生了更深入的了解？我知道您父亲在这方面起了很大作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Okay, reading your book, you have, I would say, quite an unusual childhood in terms of what you were, what you experienced, what drew you to understand more about sleep and dreams? And I know your father had a lot to do with that.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我父亲是一位睡眠医生。所以我从小就沉浸在睡眠的世界里，我将其视为通往梦境世界的门户。因此，我一直都在思考睡眠，并努力获得充足的睡眠。睡眠是我成长过程中非常重要的一部分。几年前，我读到一项科学研究说，我们梦境剥夺的程度和睡眠剥夺的程度一样。这让我思考，梦境本身为什么重要？不只是睡眠。睡眠是一个庞大的产业，我们非常关注睡眠。但梦境呢？这让我开始关注梦境科学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So my dad's a sleep doctor. So I was always immersed in this world of sleep, and I sort of look at it as sleep was kind of like this gateway to the world of dreams. And so I was always, you know, always thinking about sleep and trying to get enough sleep. And sleep was a really big part of growing up my childhood. And then a few years ago, I read this scientific study that said, we're as dream deprived as we are sleep deprived. And it made me think, you know, why do dreams matter on their own? You know, not just sleep. Sleep is its own industry and we're very focussed on sleep. But what about dreams? And then it got me. It turned me on to the science of dreaming.

</details>

### 梦境的功能：记忆与情绪处理

**Karen van Kampen**: 正如您提到的，我们对大脑的理解已经取得了长足的进步。我们对梦境的理解是否也更好了呢？我知道“我们为什么会做梦”这个问题已经困扰了几十年。但我们对这个问题有更好的理解吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: As you mentioned, and what we've talked about in terms of the brain, we have come a long way in terms of understanding the brain. Yes. Do we better understand dreams? I know this is a question of why do we dream has been asked for decades. Yes. But do we have a better understanding of that?

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 关于我们为什么会做梦，有许多可能性。一种观点是，梦境有助于巩固记忆。比如，我们白天学到了新东西或有了新体验。人们认为，在睡眠和梦境中，这有助于加强这些记忆。所以，这是**记忆巩固**（memory consolidation）的一个方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So there's many possibilities of why we dream. So one idea is that we dream to help dream sleep and dreams help consolidate memories. So let's say we've learned something new during the day or we've had a new experience. It's thought that during sleep and during dreams, it helps to strengthen these memories. So that's one thing is memory consolidation.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 就像一个梦境的储藏柜，你可以放进去，是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So a cabinet of dreams that you can put in and yes, exactly.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 还有一个很有趣的理论，叫做“**下一个最佳模型**”（next up model of dreaming）。我发现它非常迷人，因为我一直想知道，为什么我有时会梦到童年或多年前的事情？为什么我今晚会选择梦到它？这个理论认为，为了加强记忆，比如最近的经历和记忆，你会将它们与大脑中已存储的记忆库中的记忆联系起来。它通过这些联系、这些独特而又独特的联想来寻找可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So and then it's really neat. So one idea is it's called this. It's called the next up model of dreaming. And I found this fascinating because I've always wondered, you know, why do I suddenly dream of something from my childhood or years ago. Why do I do I choose to say dream of it tonight? What is it? And this idea is that in order to strengthen memories, say recent experiences, recent memories you associate it with, with memories from your catalogue of memories that are already stored in your brain. So that's it's finding possibilities through these connections, these unique and, yeah, unique connections through these associations.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 另一种理论是将梦境视为一种“**夜晚疗法**”（night therapy）。请您详细说说，这听起来很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Another theory is sort of viewing dreams as sort of a night therapy. Talk me through that. That sounds interesting.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 非常有趣。马修·沃克（Matthew Walker）的研究表明，梦境就像一夜疗法。其他梦境研究者也对此进行了研究，他们认为梦境有助于处理我们的情绪，帮助我们面对，比如说，困难的情绪。罗莎琳德·卡特赖特（**Rosalind Cartwright**），她被称为“梦境女王”。她对经历离婚的人进行了研究，发现那些做了关于离婚的令人不安的梦的人，一年后应对得更好。所以，这有助于处理情绪，同时保留记忆的细节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: It's so interesting. So yeah. So Matthew Walker, he so it's dreams as overnight therapy. And the whole idea about dreams is overnight therapy. And other dream researchers have have also studied this is that it helps to process our emotions. So it helps come to terms with, say, difficult emotions. Rosalind Cartwright, she was known as the Queen of dreams. And she did these studies on people who were going through divorce. And she found out, if you dream, you have these unsettling dreams about your divorce. You actually they the subjects tended to cope better a year later. So that is also so it's it helps to process the emotions but keep the details of the memory.

</details>

### 梦境的潜在应用与工程

**Karen van Kampen**: 还有一种观点认为，我们清醒时和入睡时，大脑是分开运作的。但当我们醒来时，有时我们可能会解决了某些问题。这有助于我们理解梦境如何帮助我们在现实世界中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: There's also this thinking of our dreams. Some people may look at look at them as two separate compartments when we're awake and we're falling asleep. But when we wake up, sometimes we might have solved some of the issues that we dealt with. Help us understand perhaps how dreams kind of help us when we wake up in our real world.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 人们认为，当我们入睡时，我们会标记某些想法，以便在夜间稍后重新审视。比如说，你正在思考一个问题，试图解决它。你可能在入睡时就一直在想这个问题。所以，在睡眠开始时，这是一个非常独特的时期，几乎就像一次梦幻般的头脑风暴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So it's thought that when we're falling asleep, we sort of tag certain ideas to revisit later in the night. So let's say you're you're trying to, you know, you're noodling around, you're thinking about a problem you're trying to solve. You might be thinking about it as you're falling asleep. So during sleep onset, it's this really unique time. It's almost like a dreamy brainstorming session.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 就像一个待办事项清单，指向另一个待办事项清单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: It's like a to do list for another to do list.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 是的。所以，你可以，甚至可以引导你的梦境想法。这就是**梦境工程**（dream engineering）。比如说，你想解决一个问题，或者想出一个新的创意。当你入睡时，你可以思考这个想法，思考你想解决的问题。这通常会帮助引导你的梦境。你正在思考的那些想法，梦境工程就是利用技术来帮助你引导和塑造你的梦境。我做过一个梦境实验，非常有趣。基本上，亚当·哈（Adam Ha）是一位梦境研究者，他帮助我在家设置了这个临时的梦境实验。在我刚入睡的几分钟里，我先录了一段话，然后它会播放录音，用我的声音说：“记住要想着一棵树。”这会帮助引导我的梦境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Exactly. So you can like if you, you can even guide your dream thoughts. That's about dream engineering okay. And so let's say you want to work on a problem. You want to solve a problem, or you want to think about a new creative idea. When you're falling asleep, you can think about this idea, think about this problem that you want to work on. And then oftentimes it will help guide your dreams. So those thoughts that you're thinking about and dream engineering uses technology to help you guide and shape your dreams. So I did this dream experiment and it was really fun. And so basically I Adam ha, he's a dream researcher and he helped me set it up, this sort of ad hoc dream experiment at home. And so as I was just falling asleep in sleep onset, the first few minutes of sleep a recording, I did a recording before and then it would record the recording played and it said it was my voice and it said, remember to think of a tree. And then. So then that would help guide my my dreams.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 你梦到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: And what did you dream that.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我梦到了各种各样的树。起初非常具体，我梦见了一棵柳树，在我家曾经有一座小木屋前面。然后，随着我进入睡眠状态越来越深，它变得越来越有创意，不那么具体，也不那么合乎逻辑。然后我想起了我和我丈夫迷失在森林里的那次经历，树木变成了海浪。它变得非常抽象。几乎是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: I dreamt about? All these different trees. First it was very concrete, okay. And I was dreaming of there was this willow tree in front of this cabin where our family used to have this cabin. And then it started to get the farther I went into sleep onset, it started getting more creative and not as concrete and not as logical. Okay. And then I thought of this time that my husband, I got lost in these woods, and then the trees became waves. And so it got very abstract. Almost. Yeah.

</details>

### 清醒梦与梦境的商业化风险

**Karen van Kampen**: 谈到抽象，我们来谈谈**清醒梦**（lucid dreams）。我敢肯定，很多听众可能都有过这样的经历：梦到自己在奔跑，突然意识到“等等，我正在做梦，我知道我在做梦”，然后可能就停下来了。请向我们解释一下清醒梦，您能告诉我们什么？为什么我们能控制？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Speaking of abstract, let's talk about lucid dreams. I'm sure there are many listeners who have probably had a dream where they're running, and then all of a sudden they're like, hold on, I am dreaming, I know I'm dreaming and probably stop. Explain to us about lucid dreams. What can you tell us about them? Why do we have control?

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 清醒梦是指在梦境发生时意识到自己身处梦中，拥有这种意识。一旦获得这种意识，就可以发展这项技能，真正学会你的梦境是你想象力的创造。所以你实际上可以掌控它。然后你就可以开始控制你的梦境角色，或者情节，你可以选择做你一直想做的事情。有些人想尝试飞行。我读到过，一位梦境研究者告诉我，有一位艺术家，他想象一个美术馆，然后推开门走进去，里面有他自己想象出来的所有美丽的画作。然后他醒来，把梦到的内容画下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So lucid dreaming is when it starts with to be aware that you're in a dream as the dream is happening, so it's to have that awareness and then once you gain the awareness, it's to develop that skill, to actually learn that you your dream is a it's a creation of your imagination. So you actually can be in control. So then you start to control your dream characters or maybe the plot you could choose, you know what to do, what you've always wanted to do. Some people want to try and fly. I read about I talked to a dream researcher and he told me, there's an artist and he imagines an art gallery, okay. And he opens the door and goes into this art gallery, and there's all these beautiful paintings and their creation of his own, his own imagination and mind. So then he wakes up and sketches out what he was dreaming.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 感觉如果我们能真正弄清楚这一点，这里面蕴含着巨大的力量。另一方面，您的书中提到了一个叫做“**梦境广告**”（Dream Advertising）的概念。是的。请帮助我们理解那是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: All right. I feel like there's a lot of a lot of power to harness here if we can really sort of figure it out. On the flip side, there's something that you talk about in your book called Dream Advertising. Yes. Help us understand what that is.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 这几年前被提出来。基本上，我们在睡眠时更容易受到影响。所以有人提出疑问，比如说，如果我们卧室里有一个扬声器，如果我们容易受到想法和思想的影响，那么，如果一家公司想在我们在睡觉时推广他们的产品，我们是否会受到影响？是的。这就是它的含义。所以，这是否可能，是否可能发生？这些都是技术上来说，如果我们能在睡眠周期的某些时候接受暗示，但它是否真的可能改变我们的购买和消费习惯呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So it was brought up a few years ago. And so basically we are more we are vulnerable when we're sleeping. And so the question was brought up, let's say if we have a speaker in our in our bedroom and it could, you know, if we're susceptible to ideas and thoughts, could it then could we be influenced, say, if a company wanted to, you know, say, push their product while we were sleeping? Yeah. So that's kind of what it is. So, you know, the is it is it probable, is it possible these are sort of, you know, things where technically, if we're susceptible to suggestion at certain times of the sleep cycle, but is it really probable that this will change our, say, buying and consumer habits?

</details>

### 梦境的整体力量与未来潜力

**Karen van Kampen**: 这告诉我们关于梦境在我们生活中的力量？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: What does that tell us about the power of dreams in our lives?

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我认为梦境非常强大。我的意思是，这让我想到，我们一生中有三分之一的时间在睡眠中度过，而其中很大一部分时间都在做梦，我们拥有一个完整的精神生活，可以利用它来引导我们的梦境以获得创造力、解决问题。然后在早上，利用我们的梦境更好地理解我们的关注点或担忧，以及什么东西在困扰着我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: I think that dreams are so powerful. I mean, it's it makes me think, you know, we spend a third of our lives asleep and a large portion of that time dreaming, and there's this whole, this mental life that we have there that we can tap into to try and guide our dreams for creativity, to solve problems. And then in the morning, use our dreams to better understand, say, our preoccupations or our concerns. What's sort of weighing on our minds.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 在您撰写这本书的过程中，您深入研究了许多研究。我很好奇，有没有哪一项研究让您觉得“哇，我们的大脑在梦境方面的工作方式真是太神奇了”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: During the production of this book? You have delved into a number of studies. I am curious, what's one that kind of left you sitting back and being like that is like, amazing to think how our brain works when it comes to dreams.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我研究过的，特别是**梦境工程**，还有**麻醉梦**（anaesthesia dreams）。**斯坦福大学**（Stanford）的一组研究人员发现，如果让患者保持在某种低于意识水平的脑状态，他们会进入一种平静放松的状态。这很棒，因为你可以重新体验潜在的困难甚至创伤性经历和事件，但处于这种平静状态下，你就能重新体验它们，并几乎为它们创造新的记忆。我与有过这些经历的人交谈过，他们说这些经历改变了他们的人生，具有变革性。这真是令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So the the work that I was so, so dream engineering for sure that I talked about and then also anaesthesia dreams. So it's a group of researchers at Stanford and they've discovered that if you keep a patient at a certain brain state just under the level of consciousness, they come to this calm, relaxed state. And it's wonderful because you can revisit potentially difficult and even traumatic experiences and events. But having this calm state so you're able to revisit them and then almost create new memories of them. And so I spoke with people who had these experiences as well, and they said they were life altering, transforming. So it's it's unbelievable. Actually.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: The potential.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 是的，潜力巨大。那里有太多东西了。我无法想象您的床头柜是什么样的，但我猜可能有一本书和一支笔。是的，我得承认，在这个访谈之前，我这个周末一直在努力回忆我的梦境，因为很多人分享梦境时，都希望得到一些符号的解读。是的。我们如何充分利用我们的梦境？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Is the potential. Yeah. There's so much there. I can't imagine what's what your bedside table looks like, but I imagine there's probably a book and a pen there. Yes, I will admit, before this interview this weekend, I was trying to remember my dreams because lots of people, when they share dreams, they want some interpretation of the symbols. Yes. How do we take full advantage of our dreams?

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我一直认为我们是自己梦境的最佳解读者。所以，关键在于我们如何去挖掘它们，深入研究它们，用不同的眼光看待它们。你知道，如果我们注意到某个特定的主题，或者某个人反复出现。我的看法是，这就像我们的梦境在说：“嘿，多关注这个想法，或者这个人。”这是你可以做到的。我参加过一个**梦境沙龙**（dream salon）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So I always think we're the best interpreter of our own dreams. So we it's how we want to tap into them, delve into them, look at them differently. You know, we know if let's say there's a certain theme or even a person keeps showing up. The way I look at it is it's like our dreams are saying, you know, pay more attention to this idea, or maybe this person, that's something that you can do. I did a dream salon.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 我确实读到过这个。是的。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: I did read about this. Yes. Okay.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 太有趣了。我以前从未分享过梦境。那是在一群朋友和梦境研究者之间进行的。非常有趣，因为我分享了一个梦境，而其他人提供了不同的视角。你分享你的梦境，然后不同的人说：“如果这是我的梦，我可能会这样想。”这完全改变了我对梦境的看法。然后，你可以从别人的视角来看待它，看看什么对你有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: So it was so interesting. I've never shared a dream before. And so it was with a group of friends and dream researchers. And it was so interesting because I shared a dream and the perspectives that other people had. So you, you share your dream and then different people say, you know, if it was my dream, I would maybe think about this. And it totally changed my perspective on my dreams. And then, you know, you can you can look at it from other people's perspectives and, and see what works for you.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 非常迷人的内容。这是一本非常精彩的书。正如我们所讨论的，它充满了潜力。Karen，非常感谢您。我非常感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen van Kampen**: Very fascinating stuff. This is a really exciting read. Lots of potential as we talked about. Karen, thank you so much for this. Really appreciate it.

</details>

**Karen van Kampen**: 谢谢您。很高兴与您交谈。
