title: 市场收盘分析：MongoDB 财报超预期，英伟达需求依旧强劲

### 市场收盘概览：涨跌互现，比特币承压

欢迎回到市场收盘节目。这是我们大约五天来的首次市场收盘，很高兴能回来。今天是十二月的第一天，我们来看看市场表现如何。早盘市场下跌，午后转为上涨，现在则处于来回拉锯的状态。标普500指数和比特币的走势是今日的焦点，不幸的是比特币一直处于下行趋势。比特币目前价格为85,000美元，盘中一度跌至83,000美元，而清晨时还高达91,000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome back to another episode of the market close. It is our first market close in about five days. Excited to be back. We are ending out the first day of December and we are going to see how this plays out. We were red in the morning, ended up going green by the afternoon and now it's kind of back and forth. S&P 500 and Bitcoin unfortunately has been the story of the day that's been to the downside. Bitcoin right there is at $85,000, did get to $83,000 at one point, down from $91,000 earlier in the morning.</p>
</details>

英伟达（Nvidia）小幅上涨1.3%。Meta 当日下跌约1%。标普500指数收于680点。我认为收盘价能维持在680点以上，从心理层面来看是非常好的。不过，这可能不会发生，因为我们只差50美分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia is going a little green, up 1.3%. Meta is basically down 1% on the day and then the S&P 500 is at 680. A 680 close I think would be very good just psychologically, staying above that 680 level. However, that might not happen because we're 50 cents away.</p>
</details>

我认为今天市场能够稳住阵脚很重要。并没有太多消息能明确指示市场应该下跌还是上涨。昨夜日本10年期债券收益率飙升至1.84%，这是自2008年以来的最高水平。我认为这可能惊吓到了比特币市场，但除此之外，没有太多疯狂的消息。过去几个小时确实出现了一些头条新闻，我们稍后会讨论，但总体而言，大盘相对平淡。标普500指数下跌了约0.42%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the fact that the market I think is holding up today is important. There haven't been a ton of pieces of news that necessarily should say the market should sell off or should go higher. We had that Japan bond yield spike overnight to the highest level, 1.84% on the 10-year since 2008. So, I think that kind of spooked out Bitcoin, but outside of that, nothing too crazy. We do have a bunch of headlines that came out over the past couple hours that we'll talk about, but overall relatively flat day for the broader market. S&P 500 right there is down about 0.42%.</p>
</details>

### AI 概念股与新兴云服务商表现分化

现在来看看**NeoClouds**（新兴云服务提供商: 指那些专注于提供AI计算能力的新型云公司），我知道 Nebius 今天获得了评级上调，所以股价上涨了7%，达到101美元。Iren 的走势也有些奇怪，对吧？Nebius 和 Iren 上涨，而 Cipher 和 Wolf 却下跌了。这几乎像是 OpenAI 的代理股上涨，而谷歌的代理股下跌，因为 Cipher 和 Wolf 获得了谷歌的投资。所以不太确定为什么会出现这种分化。Nebius 今早确实获得了评级上调，所以这可能是它表现优于其他同类公司的具体原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the NeoClouds, Nebius I know, got an upgrade today. That's why that bad boy is up 7% to $101. Iren is also following, kind of weird, right? Nebius and Iren are up. Cipher and Wolf were down. It's almost like the OpenAI proxies were green and the Google proxies, because Cipher and Wolf have investment by Google, are red. So, not really sure why the divergence is happening there. Nebius did get an upgrade this morning. So, maybe that's specifically why Nebius is outperforming all these other guys.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，英伟达今天虽然上涨，但远未达到财报发布时的高点，而 NeoClouds 却大幅走高。CoreWeave 今天也上涨了5.48%。所以你可以看到这些 NeoClouds 股票有更多的上涨动力。不幸的是，Bitmine 今天最低跌至28.80美元，现在是29.99美元，下跌了约9%。MicroStrategy 也受到了冲击，一度下跌11%，现在随着比特币的小幅反弹，跌幅收窄至4%。特斯拉当天基本持平，报429美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it is funny that Nvidia is relatively, I mean it's up today, but it's not, you know, anywhere near where it was on earnings, but the Neoclouds are going a lot higher. CoreWeave right there also up 5.48% today. So, you are seeing a little bit more momentum in those NeoClouds. Unfortunately, Bitmine, that one at its worst was at $28.80 today. Now it's at $29.99, down about 9%. MicroStrategy as well getting hit. It was down 11. Now it's only down four given Bitcoin had a little bit of a rebound. Tesla as well basically flat on the day at 429.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报：MongoDB 与 Credo 业绩惊人

盘后，我们有 MongoDB 和 Credo (CRDO) 的财报。Credo 是一家市值300亿美元的公司。我刚在聊天区发起了一个投票，询问大家认为哪家公司会表现更好。我对这两家公司都没有特别的看法。我们上次报道了他们的财报，我记得上一次，也就是第二季度，MongoDB 的业绩出人意料地好，第二天股价好像上涨了30%。所以我们来看看今天这种情况是否会延续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's kind of the story of what we've got going on. Now after hours, we've got MongoDB. Let me know in the chat if anyone owns those names. And Credo, CRDO, a $30 billion company for those that don't know the name. I'm going to put a poll right now in the chat and ask which one people think outperforms. I really don't have an opinion on either. We covered their earnings last time and last time I think Q2 was when MongoDB really surprised to the upside. I think it was up like 30% the day after. So, we're going to see if that can kind of continue going into today.</p>
</details>

### Shopify 黑五数据亮眼，股价却下跌

Amkor 也一样，博通（Broadcom）的上调评级带动了 Amkor 的股价上涨，很高兴看到这一点。Shopify 下跌5%有点奇怪，因为我们早上刚看了 Shopify CEO Toby Lütke 公布的“黑色星期五”销售数据。商家销售额同比增长25%，单日达到62亿美元。25%的同比增长，今天还有“网络星期一”，这绝对是令人难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, Amkor as well. That Broadcom upgrade got Amkor to make a move and that's why it was nice to see. Shopify down 5% is weird given we looked at the Black Friday sales numbers these mornings from Toby Lütke, the CEO of Shopify. I mean 25% year-over-year merchant sales, $6.2 billion in one day. 25% year-over-year growth. We got Cyber Monday today. I mean that's absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，Shopify 有一个网站 bfcm.shopify.com，它会实时展示每分钟的销售额，这有点疯狂。他们通过一个像弹珠机的界面来展示。现在，他们每分钟处理大约28,000个订单，销售额达到300万美元。这太疯狂了，但到目前为止，消费者似乎并不像我们过去几天听到的那样紧张。Shopify 今天下跌了，考虑到平台本身巨大的流量和负载管理，这也说得通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Shopify has that website, bfcm.shopify.com, and it shows you a live presentation of how many sales they're having every minute, which is kind of crazy. They do it through this like pinball machine. So, per minute right now, they are doing about 28,000 orders and $3 million. It's kind of crazy, but the consumer so far doesn't seem to be as stressed as kind of what we were hearing over the past couple days. Shopify went down today. Yeah, I mean it makes sense as well, just given the amount of momentum and load management they're having on the platform itself.</p>
</details>

### 罗宾汉预测市场业务增长迅猛

现在，我们确实有一些头条新闻。我们将在收盘后关注 MongoDB 和 Credo 的财报。有几条我认为很重要的头条新闻需要报道，然后再谈其他新闻。我认为最重磅的可能来自罗宾汉（Robin Hood）。我们得到了11月份预测市场的更新数据。几个小时前，我参加了 Tanner 的节目，讨论了这些预测市场。增长非常惊人。11月份交易了30亿份合约，环比增长20%，总计达到95亿份合约。他们还将举办一个名为“Robin Hood Presents: Yes. No.”的新活动，将于12月16日进行直播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what you have in the broader equity markets. Now, we do have some headlines right here. Again, we'll have MongoDB and Credo after the bell. There was a couple of headlines that I think are important to cover and then we'll get into all the other pieces of news. I think the biggest one was probably from Robin Hood. So, we got an update on the prediction markets for November. I joined Tanner's show a couple of hours ago to talk about these prediction markets. It's pretty incredible growth. November had three billion contracts traded. That's up 20% month over month, 9.5 billion contracts in total. And they're hosting a new event called Robin Hood Presents: Yes. No. It's going to be streamed on December 16.</p>
</details>

关于这个活动，Vlad 在 Hood 峰会上告诉我们这将是一个 AI 活动，是他们在不到12个月内的第四个活动，这本身就已经很疯狂了。但他们将其命名为“Robin Hood Presents: Yes. No.”，这对我来说意味着它不仅仅是关于 AI，很可能与 AI 和预测市场都有关。因此，我认为他们将大力推广整个预测市场生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the thing about this event is Vlad told us back at the Hood Summit that this was going to be an AI event, their fourth event in less than 12 months, which already is crazy. But they're making it called Robin Hood Presents: Yes. No. Which to me signals that it's not just going to be about AI. It's likely going to be about AI and prediction markets. And as a result, I think they're going to be ramping up the entire prediction markets ecosystem.</p>
</details>

这将非常令人兴奋。我告诉过大家，我一直在对预测市场这个整个行业做更多的研究。我可能会在几天后发布一篇相关的 Substack 文章。但我认为这是一个非常庞大的行业。他们上周与 Susquehanna Group 成立合资公司并收购一家交易所的股权，让其成为做市商，原因可能是他们看到了巨大的交易量，需要建立自己的清算所来支持。鉴于他们一个月内交易了30亿份合约，似乎确实需要像罗宾汉这样的新做市商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's going to be very exciting to see. So, I mean, I told you guys I've been doing a lot more research on prediction markets as an entire industry. I'm probably going to have a substack on it in a couple days, but I think this is a very big industry. The reason why they bought an exchange or took an equity position in an exchange with Susquehanna Group as the market maker on the joint venture last week is because they're probably seeing a ridiculous amount of volumes that they need to build their own clearing house to be able to support. And given they did three billion contracts in a month, it seems like there is a need for a new market maker like Robin Hood.</p>
</details>

罗宾汉股价为123美元，由于加密货币市场的影响，当天仍下跌4%。但有趣的是，如果加密货币在2026年剩余时间里持续下跌——谁知道这是否会发生——你还有预测市场。所以，如果罗宾汉失去了加密货币的波动性，体育赛事不会消失。如果人们继续在体育、天气或任何他们喜欢预测的事件上下注，这种波动性，特别是如果罗宾汉占据了大量市场份额，虽然可能不如加密货币那样有利可图，但如果他们能匹配交易量，就能弥补加密货币收入的不足。这正体现了罗宾汉的护城河，即能够在各种不同的生态系统中构建产品并仍然表现出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Robin Hood right there at $123, still down 4% on the day because of crypto. But the fun thing about this is if crypto sells off throughout the rest of 2026, which who knows if that's going to happen or not. You've got prediction markets. So, if Robin Hood loses the crypto volatility, sports aren't going anywhere. And if people are going to continue betting on sports or weather or whatever events people like to predict markets on, that volatility, especially if Robin Hood takes a large part of the market share, it's not going to be as lucrative as crypto, but if they can match the volumes, they can make up for the lack of revenue from crypto, which just goes to the moat that Robin Hood has about being able to build products in a variety of different ecosystems and still outperform.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与美联储展望

美联储主席鲍威尔（JPAL）将在晚上8点发表讲话。我再次重申，我不认为他会说任何重要的事情，因为现在是“静默期”（blackout week）。美联储成员不能谈论政策。他们上周已经把该说的都说了。所以也许我们会听到鲍威尔的一些评论，但到今天结束时，我会报告我们得到的消息。是的，鲍威尔将在东部时间晚上8点，太平洋时间下午5点在斯坦福大学讲话。我认为这更像是与斯坦福毕业生的交流，而不是关于经济的严肃谈话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">JPAL is going to be speaking at 8:00 PM. So, again, I don't think he's going to be saying anything that important because it's a blackout week. Fed can't talk. They're not supposed to be saying anything. So, they said everything they had to say last week. So, maybe we'll get some comments from JPAL, but going into the end of the day, I'll report on what we get. Yeah. JP at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific at Stanford. I think it's going to be like just talking to the Stanford graduates, not really something so serious in regards to talking about the economy.</p>
</details>

从热力图来看，苹果、亚马逊、英伟达领涨，其他股票大多下跌。连谷歌也下跌了1.2%。沃尔玛和家得宝上涨，能源股也上涨。这可能是因为市场担心与委内瑞拉发生战争，这对油价显然不是好事。所以能源股可能因此有所反弹。但英伟达是今天领涨的股票，而且它在一天中的大部分时间里都是下跌的。因此，它在收盘前出现反弹，还算不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's take a look at the heat map here. Apple, Amazon, Nvidia leading the day. Everything else kind of taking a hit. Even Google taking a 1.2% hit. Walmart's up, Home Depot's up. Energy's up. You might have some fears about a war with Venezuela, which obviously would not be good for oil prices. So maybe the energy stocks rallying a little bit off that. But Nvidia right there is kind of leading the day and it wasn't leading the day. It was down for the majority of the day. So the fact that it's recovering towards the end is not too bad.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币市场的悲观情绪

谈到受打击的人，加密货币生态系统中也有一些人遭受了重创。我还没看这个视频，但这是 Cactus Jack 发给我的，所以我们大家一起看。视频里这个人，这么说吧，他对加密货币表现不佳感到非常不满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of people getting hit, you've got some people that have also been crashing out on the crypto ecosystem. I have not watched this video yet, but Cactus Jack sent it to me, so we're all gonna be watching it at the same time. But here's this guy who, well, let's just say he's not happy that crypto is not doing that well.</p>
</details>

> 我厌倦了失败。我厌倦了亏掉我所有的钱。你（特朗普）向我们承诺会让加密货币再次伟大。你向我们承诺我们会变得富有。唯一富有的人是你和你的家人。你这个彻头彻尾的混蛋。你输掉了 MEMECOIN。你推出的 VAPORWARE 加密货币没人想要。你被所有加密货币官员贿赂。你赦免罪犯来摧毁市场。埃里克·特朗普说第四季度对我们的银行来说将是难以置信的。哦，确实难以置信。我亏了多少钱真是难以置信。埃里克·特朗普。唐纳德·特朗普。小唐纳德·特朗普，你们毁了我的生活。我唯一信任的人是巴伦·特朗普，因为他有8英尺高。巴伦，你告诉我该怎么做，因为现在我恨透了特朗普家族。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'M TIRED OF LOSING ALL MY MONEY. YOU PROMISED US YOU'D MAKE CRYPTO GREAT AGAIN. YOU PROMISED US WE'D BE RICH. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE RICH IS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. YOU ABSOLUTE SLIME BALL. YOU LOST THE MEMECOIN. YOU'RE LAUNCHING VAPORWARE CRYPTO THAT NO ONE WANTS. YOU GET BRIBED BY ALL THE CRYPTO OFFICIALS. YOU PARDON CRIMINALS TO DESTROY THE MARKET. ERIC TRUMP SAYS Q4 WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE FOR OUR BANKS. OH, IT'S PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE LOST. ERIC TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP JR., YOU GUYS DESTROYED MY LIFE. THE ONLY PERSON I WOULD TRUST IS BARRON TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S 8 FEET TALL. BARRON, YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I HATE THE TRUMP FAMILY.</p>
</details>

好的，他可能有点表演成分，但我认为这种情绪在加密货币生态系统中非常真实，你不能责怪人们有这种感觉。我不知道是否必须把所有这些都归咎于特朗普，但无论如何，比特币今年确实表现不佳。更糟糕的是，今天早上有人问，MicroStrategy 将不得不怎么做？他们最终会卖掉他们的加密货币吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> OKAY, so he's probably acting a little bit there, but the sentiment I think is very real in the crypto ecosystem and you can't blame people for feeling like that. I don't know if you necessarily have to blame Trump about all this stuff, but nonetheless, Bitcoin has just not performed this year. And to make things worse, you know, someone asked a question this morning, what is MicroStrategy going to have to do? Would they end up selling their crypto?</p>
</details>

答案是，是的，MicroStrategy 的 CEO 承认他们理论上可以出售比特币，尽管最终决定权在 Michael Saylor 手中。

> “所以现在，当我们面临‘比特币寒冬’，看到我们的 MNAV（市值与净资产值比率）正在压缩时，我希望我们的 MNAV 不会低于1。但如果我们真的跌破了，并且我们没有其他融资渠道，我们就会出售比特币。”
> “但这几乎是最后的手段。”
> “那将是最后的手段。我认为从数学的角度来看，这绝对是正确的做法。但从情感和市场的角度来看，我们真的不想成为那个出售比特币的公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, well, here's the clip. The answer is, yeah, the CEO of MicroStrategy, obviously Saylor is going to have the final decision here, but he admits we theoretically could sell our Bitcoin.
>> And so now as we're looking at, you know, Bitcoin winter, as we see our MNAV compressing, my hope is our MNAV doesn't go below one. But if we did and we didn't have other access to capital, we would sell Bitcoin.
>> But that would almost be a last resort.
>> That would be a last resort. And I think like math, there's the mathematical side of me that says that would be absolutely the right thing to do. Uh, and there's the emotional side of me, the market side of me that says, you know, we don't want to really be the company that's selling Bitcoin.</p>
</details>

正如 Saylor 多次表示，他们不会出售比特币。但现在 CEO 承认他们可能不得不这样做。而且，从法律上讲，他们至少必须发布一个免责声明，说明他们可能会这样做。这是他们演示文稿中的内容，他们说：“嘿，如果我们的 MNAV 低于1，我们可能会出售比特币或比特币衍生品。” 所以避免这种情况的最好办法就是比特币不要暴跌，希望它不会。但无论如何，这就是为什么 MicroStrategy 和其他加密货币衍生品股票在过去几天里受到重创的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so now, as Sailor has said many times, they're not going to sell Bitcoin. But you got the CEO admitting that they might have to. And again, legally, they have to at least put a disclaimer that they could do this. This is from their presentation right here as well, where they said, "Hey, if we are below 1x MNAV, we could sell Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin derivatives." So the best way to avoid that is for Bitcoin to not go down the gutter and hopefully it doesn't. But nonetheless, that is why MicroStrategy and BMR and a lot of these other crypto derivative plays have been getting pretty hit over the past couple days.</p>
</details>

### “圣诞老人行情”还会来吗？

很多人一直在问，“圣诞老人行情”什么时候开始？嗯，根据我们的朋友 Ryan Detrick 的说法，技术上讲，它要到月中才真正开始。从1950年到2024年，标普500指数在12月的前15天是持平的。所以圣诞老人要到月底才进城。正如你所看到的，从15日到31日，市场会有所上涨，平均涨幅为1.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Santa Claus rally. A lot of people have been asking, hey, when does the Santa Claus rally start? Well, technically, this is from our boy Ryan Detrick. It doesn't really start till the middle of the month. So S&P historically from 1950 to 2024, the first 15 days is flat. So Santa comes to town closer to the end of the month as you can see right there from the 15th to the 31st you get a bit of a move and that aggregates to 1.4%.</p>
</details>

所以接下来的15天，也就是未来两周，如果存在任何季节性的上涨趋势，你可能需要等待。另一件需要记住的重要事情是，这并不是说“圣诞老人行情”不会发生，但了解这个背景很重要。很多“圣诞老人行情”的汇总数据是基于9月和10月表现非常糟糕的前提。因此，12月往往会出现反弹，以弥补9月和10月的很多损失。今年9月和10月表现很好。11月虽然下跌，但也只下跌了大约0.75%，不算太糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the next 15 days, next two weeks, you know, if there is any seasonal move that is going to be green, you might have to wait for it. The other thing that's important to remember as well, and this is not to say the Santa Claus rally won't happen, but it's important to have this context. A lot of that Santa Claus rally aggregate data is based on the idea of September and October being really bad. So December you tend to get a rally and reverse a lot of the losses that you have from September and October. This year September and October were great. November was bad, but November was down a percent. You know, it's not crazy. It was like 0.75%.</p>
</details>

从这个角度来看，问题就变成了：12月必须表现出色吗？我认为有其他原因可能让12月表现良好，但那种固有的季节性论点今年全年都没有站住脚。这很大程度上是因为我们4月份因关税问题出现了下跌。所以我们得看看今年12月底情况是否会一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you think about it from that perspective, it's like does December have to be phenomenal? I think there's other reasons why December could be good, but the sort of built-in seasonality argument hasn't held up the entire year. And a lot of that was because of the April downside that we had with tariffs. And so we're going to have to see if it holds up the same going into the end of December this year.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报深度分析

我们收盘后有两家公司的财报，MongoDB 和 Credo。61%的人认为 MongoDB 会表现更好，31%的人认为 Credo 会更好。我们应该在大约五分钟后，也就是收盘钟声敲响后，得到他们的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, we got two earnings after the bell. Let me know if anyone owns these stocks, MongoDB and Credo. Uh, not the drone company, the other one, CRDO. 61% thinks MongoDB outperforms. And Credo is about 31%. We should be getting their earnings in about five minutes as soon as the bell rings.</p>
</details>

哇，MongoDB 和 Credo 的业绩数字非常惊人。MongoDB 的每股收益（EPS）超出预期67%，达到1.32美元，预期为79美分。营收超出预期6%，为6.28亿美元，预期为5.93亿美元。EPS同比增长14%，营收同比增长19%。这可能是我们整个季度看到的**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）公司中最大的业绩超预期之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, these are big numbers. These are big boy numbers. MongoDB beat EPS by 67%. $1.32 versus 79 cents expected. Revenue they beat by 6%, $6.28 million versus $5.93 million. EPS up 14% year-over-year. Revenue up 19% year-over-year. 67%, of course. But my goodness, that's a hell of a beat. I think that's one of the biggest beats we've seen for a SaaS name all quarter.</p>
</details>

Credo 的 EPS 超出预期34%，为67美分，预期为50美分。营收超出预期14%。营收同比增长272%，EPS 同比增长857%。这些数字太惊人了。我知道这些不是世界上最大的公司，但你会期望它们能显示出 AI 作为顺风的推动作用，而对于它们各自的业务模式来说，都应该有一定程度的内在顺风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Credo, they beat EPS by 34%. 67 cents, it's not a beat by 67%, but 67 cents of EPS beating by 34% versus 50 cents expected. Revenue beat by 14%. Revenue is up 272% year-over-year. EPS is up 857% year-over-year. Wow, those are big numbers, dude. Those are big numbers. I know these are not the largest companies in the world but you would expect them to show AI being a tailwind and for each of them there should be some level of tailwind intrinsically given their business models.</p>
</details>

Credo 盘后上涨了11%，MongoDB 上涨了13.4%。投票结果是哪家表现更好，现在两家公司的涨幅非常接近。这些财报数据非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Credo is now up 11% after hours. Mongo's up 13.4%. The poll was which one outperforms. Both of them are relatively, I mean Credo is 1% away, less than 1% from catching up to MongoDB after hours. Goodness, these are good numbers.</p>
</details>

让我们深入了解一下 Credo 的数据。营收为2.68亿美元，环比增长20%，同比增长272%。CEO 表示：“第二季度，Credo 实现了2.68亿美元的营收，环比增长20%。这是 Credo 历史上最强劲的季度业绩，反映了全球最大的人工智能训练和推理集群的持续建设。展望未来，我们核心的 AEC 和 IC 业务的持续增长，加上我们最近宣布的 ALC 即将投产，为我们带来了强劲的收入增长和盈利能力前景，直至2026财年及以后。” 又一位 CEO 表示数据中心需求强劲。

<details>

<p class="english-text">While we're waiting for the MongoDB numbers, here's Credo. Uh, revenue of 268 million. That's up 20% quarter over quarter, 272% year-over-year. CEO says in the second quarter, Credo delivered revenue of 268 million, an increase of 20% sequentially. These are the strongest quarterly results in Credo's history and they reflect the continued buildout of the world's largest AI training and inference clusters. Looking forward, the combination of continued growth in our core AEC and IC franchises, plus the upcoming ramps of our recently announced ALCs gives us an outlook with strong revenue growth and profitability through fiscal 2026 and beyond. Again, another CEO saying data center demand is strong.</p>

### 深度解析：英伟达的市场主导地位与AI前景

让我们来谈谈英伟达。摩根士丹利今天发布了一份关于英伟达的更新报告，我认为非常重要，绝对引起了我的注意。摩根士丹利在过去一周访问了亚洲，并与众多客户进行了交谈，以获取他们对英伟达情况的更多看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about is Nvidia. There was an update from Morgan Stanley on Nvidia that I think was really important today and definitely got my attention. Morgan Stanley went to Asia over the past week and they talked to a bunch of customers to get some more updates on what they think is happening with Nvidia.</p>
</details>

他们表示：“我们继续看到英伟达保持着主导的市场份额，对其的威胁被夸大了，尽管我们不确定什么能扭转市场情绪。” 他们说的第一件事是，嘿，我们在调查中看到的一切都非常好，但我们不确定什么能改变市场情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's what they said. "We continue to see Nvidia maintaining dominant market shares as threats are being overstated though we aren't exactly sure what will turn sentiment around." So the first thing they're saying is hey like everything we're seeing in our checks are really good but we're not sure what's going to turn sentiment around.</p>
</details>

但最核心的一句话让我觉得不可思议。他们说：“我们的信念，基于行业背景，即英伟达将在大多数应用中拥有最佳的经济效益，是坚定不移的。客户未来12个月最大的焦虑是他们能否采购到足够的英伟达产品，特别是 Rubin 芯片。” 这对我来说简直难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at its core, this was the sentence that was just incredible to me. They said, "Our belief informed by industry context that Nvidia will have the best economics for most applications is unwavering. Customers' biggest anxiety for the next 12 months is their ability to procure enough Nvidia product generally and their Rubin specifically." That to me was just incredible to hear.</p>
</details>

所以摩根士丹利说：“我们和客户谈过了，他们不担心 AI 泡沫。他们不担心 Michael Burry 的想法或折旧问题。他们担心的是我们能不能拿到产品，因为太难了。” 这与 Jensen 一直以来的说法非常一致，不仅体现在他提高业绩指引上，这表明 Jensen 不是在吹牛，他说的确实有数据支持，而且他还说我们的需求大于供给。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Morgan Stanley saying, "We talked to the customers and they are not concerned about an AI bubble. They are not concerned about Michael Burry and his thoughts or depreciation. They are concerned about can we get the product because it is so hard." And that goes very consistent with what Jensen's been saying, not only from a raising guidance perspective, which is like showing that Jensen is not just, you know, blowing hot air. He's like legitimately saying something that's backed up by the numbers, but also what he's saying is that we have more demand than supply.</p>
</details>

摩根士丹利接着说：“当然，每个人都想要替代品，而这些替代品在某些应用中也会有很好的经济效益。谷歌的 **TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌为加速机器学习工作负载而设计的专用集成电路）在各方面都是一个可靠的替代品，并且为几个关键模型做出了重要贡献。但值得记住的是，英伟达本季度数据中心收入达到了510亿美元，大约是 TPU 收入的14倍，并且实现了100亿美元的环比收入增长，这本身就是 TPU 收入的3倍左右。即使在以 TPU 为主的工作负载中，我们也被告知仍然有重要的英伟达贡献，即使在数量上是少数，但在数据中心收入中可能占了大多数。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Morgan Stanley goes on to say, "Of course, everyone wants an alternative, and those alternatives will have good economics for some applications. TPU is by all accounts a solid alternative and one that has meaningfully contributed to several key models. But it's worth keeping in mind that Nvidia just did $51 billion in data center revenues for the quarter, roughly 14x TPU revenues, and put up $10 billion of sequential revenue growth. Itself about 3x TPU revenues. Even in the workloads that were majority TPU, we were informed that there was still a meaningful Nvidia contribution that may have been the majority of data center revenues even if it was a minority of volumes."</p>
</details>

所以，如果你持有英伟达，我认为你不需要彻夜难眠。关于谷歌 TPU 的讨论很重要，也很有意义，对于多头来说，通过审视所有不同的竞争对手来质疑自己的假设是非常健康的。但数字说明了一切，除非你不相信这些数字，否则数字表明需求超过了供应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean like I was talking about this with Tanner on his stream, like if you own Nvidia I don't think you need to be losing sleep at night and I think the Google TPU conversation is important. It's relevant and it is very healthy for for bulls to question their assumptions by looking at all the different competitors that are out there. But like the numbers tell the story and unless you don't believe the numbers, the numbers are saying demand outstrips supply.</p>

### 罗宾汉的预测市场：是赌博还是新型金融工具？

这是我的观点。我本周晚些时候会发布一篇关于预测市场的 Substack 文章，但我认为所有说预测市场是赌博的人都错了。我再说一遍，我不认为预测市场是赌博。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's my take. I'm coming out with a substack later this week on prediction markets but I think everyone who says prediction markets are gambling, this is the take. I do not think prediction markets are gambling. Let me say that again. I do not think prediction markets are gambling.</p>
</details>

我的论点很简单。如果你认为这是赌博，那么你也必须认为期权交易也是赌博。如果你认为两者都是赌博，那你可以这么认为。但我更多是针对那些说“罗宾汉在推广赌博”的人。好吧，如果这是赌博，那么我认为期权也是赌博。如果是这样，那么 Schwab、Vanguard、Fidelity、SoFi 等所有券商都在推广赌博。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Simple thesis. If you think it's gambling then you have to think that options are gambling as well. Which then if you think both are gambling then you can think that. But I'm more so talking about the people that are like Robin Hood's promoting gambling. Well, if this is gambling, then I think options are gambling. If that's the case, Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, SoFi, all the brokerages are promoting gambling.</p>
</details>

为什么我认为预测市场基本上就像一份期权合约？我整个周末都在思考这个问题。湖人队对阵尼克斯队。预测市场显示湖人队有60%的胜率，尼克斯队有40%。你可以下注或投机，或者你可以用量化方法分析所有数据，顺便说一句，体育分析是一个巨大的产业。然后你可以决定是否认为湖人队会赢，花60美分买一份合约，或者尼克斯队会赢，花40美分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why do I think prediction markets are basically like an options contract? I was thinking about this a lot over the weekend. Lakers play the Knicks. Prediction market. Lakers 60% chance. Knicks 40% chance. You can bet or speculate or you can take a quantitative approach to looking at all the analytics and data which by the way the sports analytics is a massive industry. And you can then make a decision on if you think the Lakers are going to win, pay 60 cents for a contract or if the Knicks are going to win, pay 40 cents.</p>
</details>

如果我认为英伟达股价到本周末会达到185美元，这就是一份到本周末到期的期权合约。然后必须发生某件事，这是一个二元事件。湖人队或尼克斯队必须赢，我才能根据我的选择获利。英伟达必须达到185美元。如果到周五它没有达到185美元，我就会亏掉所有的钱。我们可以接受这个前提吗？所以，二元结果。要么英伟达是185美元，要么不是。要么湖人队赢，要么他们输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I think Nvidia is going to be 185 by the end of this week, that is an options contract that has an expiration by the end of this week. And then there is something that has to happen. There's a binary event. The Lakers or Knicks have to win for me to win based on whoever I chose. Nvidia has to get to 185. If it does not get to 185 by Friday, I lose all my money. Can we accept that premise right there? So, binary outcome. Either Nvidia is 185 or whatever strike you want to pick on your contract, or it's not. Either the Lakers win or they lose.</p>
</details>

我们已经开始看到这两者之间的比较：其中一个是带有到期日的合约，就像湖人对尼克斯的比赛将在晚上10点结束后到期一样。那就是一个到期日。并且会有一个结果。要么他们赢，要么他们输。要么英伟达上涨，要么下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Already, we're starting to see the comparison between one of these is a contract with an expiration, just like the Lakers Knicks game is going to end at 10 p.m. after they play. That is an expiration. And there's going to be one outcome. Either they win or they lose. Either Nvidia is up or it's down.</p>
</details>

在二元事件的生命周期内，合约的盘中、波段、日内、周内波动，无论你想持有多长时间，都是预测市场的交易部分，这与期权合约完全相同。我很难看出其中的区别。我知道很多人同意我的观点，我也准备好接受批评。但我从逻辑上看不出有人押注英伟达本周末涨到185美元和有人押注尼克斯对湖人比赛的区别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The intra swing movement or intraday, intra hour, intra week, I mean whatever amount of time you want to swing the contract within the life cycle of the binary event is the trading portion of the prediction market which is the exact same thing as an options contract. I am struggling to see the difference and I know a lot of people are agreeing with me here and I'm ready to take the heat for this. I just logically do not see the difference between someone betting on Nvidia going to 185 by the end of the week and someone betting on the Knicks versus the Lakers.</p>

### 宏观经济展望与市场情绪

最后，我想和大家分享一篇关于2026年市场前景的帖子，它很好地总结了当前正在发生的事情。白银接近60美元，黄金4300美元。美联储正在降息。盈利增长是多年来最好的。中期选举即将到来，所有迹象都表明将有大规模的财政刺激。预计2026年将出现多年来最大规模的退税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's this post. I want to read this post to everybody. I think it's a really good synopsis of what is happening going into 2026. It's a little long, but I'll get through it because I'll be fast as I read. But here's all the things that are happening right now in the market. Silver's at almost $60. Gold's at $4,300. The Fed is cutting rates. Earnings growth the best in years. Midterm elections upcoming with all signs of massive fiscal stimulus. Largest tax refunds in years expected in 2026.</p>
</details>

AI在科学、生物技术、机器人等领域的进步，可能将释放新的生产力奇迹。标普的利润率高得惊人。美国财政部公开主张弱势美元，这对 比特币有利。美国财政赤字接近两万亿美元，这意味着我们必须通过增长来摆脱困境。这是埃隆·马斯克关于AI和机器人技术是解决赤字问题的唯一途径的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI advancements in science, biotech, robotics, and other areas potentially ready to unleash new productivity miracles. S&P margins are out of this world. He's right about that, which is why we're trading at 22 times forward. The Treasury is openly advocating for a weaker dollar, bullish for Bitcoin. US fiscal deficits running close to two trillion, which means guess what? We got to grow out of that. This is kind of Elon's argument about AI and robotics being the only way to deal with the deficit issue.</p>
</details>

人类历史上最富有的一代人已经并将继续疯狂消费，无论就业情况如何。消费者支出在增加。有史以来最好的黑色星期五。预计将迎来第一个万亿美元的圣诞消费季。全球股市正经历几十年来最好的一年。事实上，美国是全世界表现最差的市场。但是，是的，买新房比以前更难了，市盈率也有点高。所以，我想我应该做空市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The wealthiest generation in human history has been and will continue to spend like crazy regardless of the employment picture. Consumer spending is up. Best Black Friday ever. First one trillion Christmas spending season expected. Global equity markets having their best year in decades. In fact, the United States is the worst performing market across the entire world. But yes, it is harder to afford a new house than it used to be and P/Es are a bit elevated. So, I guess I'll short the market.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，当你听到所有这些论点，以及他没有提到的另一件事，即今年美国ETF的净流入额超过1.2万亿美元，但市盈率有点高，房子变得更贵了，所以我就去做空。我不知道，这是最好的论点吗？还是一个只想通过预测顶部来获得所有功劳的人的论点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, again, when you hear all of those arguments and the other thing that he didn't mention is that the net inflows for US ETFs is topping 1.2 trillion this year, like but P/Es are up a little bit and houses have become more expensive, so I'm going to go short. I don't know. Is that like is that the best argument or is that an argument of someone who just wants to call a top and get all the credit for calling a top?</p>
