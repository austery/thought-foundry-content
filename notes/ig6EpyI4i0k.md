### 新年阅读展望与经典重读的价值

随着2026年的到来，《纽约时报书评》的编辑们齐聚一堂，展望未来几个月的阅读图景。他们分享了各自的新年阅读目标，普遍表达了对“重新开始”的乐观情绪。其中一位编辑计划阅读更多经典作品，如**《呼啸山庄》**（Wuthering Heights）和**《安娜·卡列尼娜》**（Anna Karenina），并希望在阅读过程中放慢节奏，深入研究与书籍相关的评论文章和背景资料，以拓宽对文学对话和引用的理解。另一位编辑则表示，自己的阅读习惯一直良好，因此今年的目标是保持现状，不加干预。

对于经典作品的重读，编辑们达成了一个共识：重读那些年轻时因学业要求而读过的书籍，能够以更成熟的视角和人生经验去理解它们，从而获得全新的价值。课堂作业的强制性往往会让人产生抵触情绪，阻碍读者真正投入其中。而当这些作品不再是“作业”时，以成年人的身份，带着开放的心态去重新审视，会发现更多深层次的意义。这种自主选择的阅读方式，能够让读者更自由地探索和享受文学的乐趣。

Hello, I'm Gilbert Cruz. I'm Jima Katib. And I'm MJ Franklin. We are all editors at the New York Times Book Review. And it's January, which means there's an entire year of reading ahead of the three of us and ahead of all of you. We are here this week to help guide you through the first several months of 2026. We're going to be talking about a handful of titles coming out between now and the end of March. Why specifically the end of March? Because in March, we're going to have to do another one of these, a spring books preview. We'll talk about what goes up until the summer then. That is why. Shiman and MJ, welcome. How are you feeling now that it's a new year? Before we get into specifics, what do you have any reading goals that you set for yourself this year? I really love the new year. I feel optimistic anytime I get to do a blank slate restart. So I feel like 2026 a whole bunch of new books that I'm excited to dive into. I have a few goals. One of them is to read more classics and I have a series of classics that I want to read that include Weathering Heights and Anna Corin just things I really I feel are so influential but I never got around to. And then one goal of mine is to slow down and when I'm reading stuff, go back and find as many essays as I can find about that book. Not just read the book, but fill out my knowledge of the conversation, fill out the references, all of that stuff. So those are my strange, heady goals. Look at you. Look at this man who believes in criticism. Here at the New York Times Book Review, we believe in criticism. It's alive and well. That's amazing. Shimata, do you have any goals this year? If I can be vulnerable on Maine, I will say that my reading is one of the few areas of my life that consistently goes well. So, I'm going to try and not interfere too much and just do as I have been doing. Yeah. Do not quit while you're ahead. Do you have any goals? I MG I think we came to a shared goal separately, which is I am hoping to read classics I've never read. I'm definitely going to check out the aforementioned Weathering Heights. Jima has been talking about Middle March for what I feel like has been six months. I've always wanted to read Middle March. And then I feel like there are a bunch of books I read when I was younger, either in high school or college, and you do it because it's part of the class and you have to. And maybe for me, this particular person, I was just not smart enough or mature enough to really get it or understand it. I think there can be great value in going back to some of those books that we were made to read when we were younger and actually bringing our experiences to it and understanding it in a different way. I also think reading these books outside of a classroom when it's no longer homework, just the fact of it being homework makes it feel obligatory. You roll your eyes at it. You sigh having to do all of the stuff while you're so busy. And so you shut down certain receptors to receive this book. and being able to revisit it on your own terms makes you more open and you get more out of it and reading it as an adult. You understand more. I'm a big proponent of rereading. I'm a big proponent of visiting classics that you haven't picked up ever. Be free. Read what you want to and enjoy. These are great 2026 goals. Let's all go back. Let's revisit some stuff. We should also read some new stuff. And we're going to say in January, February, and March some of the books that we are really excited by, really jazzed by. I didn't give you an order beforehand. So, I'm just going to I'm going to point I don't know why I'm closing my eyes like that's going to make a difference. MJ, I'm going to point at you. So, I will start then. And I want to start with a book, Vigil by George Saunders. George Saunders is back. He is This is a big one. A big one. He is an all-time fave. He is just a good writer. So this is his return after about four years. His book Liberation Day came out a few years ago, but I think he's probably best known for Lincoln and the Bardau, which was 2017, and 10th of December, which is 2013. Although real George Saunders heads would maintain that he has been with it since Civil War Land and Bad Decline, which is also a great title. I'm so sorry that is I'm I am obligated to put that in there because I love his stories. This is a long way of saying George Saunders has been out here and he's just someone that you should read and look forward to. Vigil is about a ghost. Her name is Jill and she is in this not fully purgatory, but she hasn't totally transcended over. She has this job and she has to help usher dying souls to the afterlife. She has to help them accept that they're dying, find peace, and then transcend over. She's like a ghost doula. Exactly. Okay. Exactly. Abdullah in the Bardau. That should be none of those word none of those words are in the Bible. I will only be referring to this book as Adoula and the Bardau because that is pretty accurate. Um, this time she has to usher along a pretty unreorseful oil exact. His name is KJ Boone. And in his life, he exploited a ton of people and he knowingly hurt a ton of people and he is dying and he has to come to terms with that. And she's like, "Oh, this man, he's pretty odious and he is so full of himself, but she's got a job to do." However, Boon is being haunted by other ghosts who want him to suffer for his crimes. And so, there's this other ghost that's popping in. And meanwhile, Jill is grappling with her own burdens, which is why she has not transcended over completely, too. And so, you're in this weird between life and death state, and it's so creative. And it's similar to Lincoln and Lardo in terms of the creativity at play. It's probably more formally straightforward, but it's just George Saunders just back full of heart. It's a hard task to try to say, "Let's be invested in the emotional and spiritual rehabilitation of this pretty terrible man, but if anyone can do it, it is George Saunders." And so that's what Vigil is. Are you looking forward to reading this one, Jumata? It is very important to note under 200 pages. Oh my god. I don't want to start the year with page counts. I just I don't That's my goal is to not look at page counts. What is the problem here? I think that we are giving too much power to the length of a book. I don't think that the length of a book is a reason to be daunted or put off. I have to say I'm with Gumani here. I think it's nice that this one is short partially because he packs so much into it. But if it were 500 pages, I'd be so there I would read anything that George Saunders writes. George Saunders, our podcast series, The Interview, just did an interview with him where he talks about how he has developed this reputation for being a nice guy, being someone who's so focused on kindness and all this stuff in part because of a commencement speech that he gave several years ago that was then turned into a book. We should never forget, and I think if you've read any of his short stories or this is only a second novel, he is weird. He is a real weirdo. And there's something wonderful about that. I also think that he's just like a real craftsman. What he's able to do and how he stages his scenes. I had the privilege of interviewing him when Lincoln and the Bardau came out and my co-host for that interview asked about a line and that line is in the middle of this scene and there came upon us a rain of hats and my co-host asked him about it and George was just like I don't I was in the scene and I felt it needed more verticality. Listening to how he thinks about staging a scene and what it can do and the significance of that. And verticality by the way is something to watch for in vigil of people ascending, descending, where they are. Not just what they're saying and how they're feeling, but what they are doing and the literary richness of that. I think yeah, people talk about George Saunders's heart, but he is just a meticulous, thoughtful craftsman as well. There's also a scene in this book, which I was able to read this weekend because it's pretty short, in which one one of one ghostly character starts to reproduce themselves through their butt, I believe. Yeah, it's insane. Yeah, it's great. He's the best. He's the best. So, that is Visual by George Saunders out January 27th. MJ, you pointed someone. Okay, you're up.

### 奇幻与现实交织的文学探索

在新年阅读目标的讨论之后，编辑们开始推荐即将出版的新书。首先介绍的是**乔治·桑德斯**（George Saunders）的回归之作**《守夜》**（Vigil），定于1月27日发行。桑德斯是备受推崇的作家，以其独特的写作风格和深刻的人性洞察力而闻名，其代表作包括2017年的**《林肯在中阴》**（Lincoln in the Bardo）和2013年的**《十二月十日》**（10th of December）。

**《守夜》**讲述了一个名为吉尔的幽灵的故事。她并非完全处于炼狱之中，也未完全超脱，而是肩负着一项特殊任务：引导垂死的灵魂进入来世，帮助他们接受死亡、找到平静并最终超脱。她就像一个“幽灵导乐师”。这一次，她需要引导一个顽固不化的石油大亨KJ·布恩。布恩生前剥削并伤害了无数人，现在面临死亡，却不愿悔改。吉尔虽然觉得他令人厌恶且自负，但仍需完成自己的职责。然而，布恩还被其他渴望他为罪行受苦的幽灵所困扰。与此同时，吉尔也在与自己的心魔斗争，这也是她未能完全超脱的原因。这本书以其高度的创造性，将读者带入一个介于生死之间的奇特状态，展现了桑德斯一贯的风格，充满温情。尽管让读者关注一个“糟糕透顶”的人的情感和精神救赎是一项艰巨的任务，但如果有人能做到，那非乔治·桑德斯莫属。

编辑们还讨论了书籍篇幅的问题，有人认为短篇幅是优点，但也有人认为不应被页数吓倒。桑德斯以其精湛的技艺和对场景的细致构建而著称。他不仅关注人物的言语和感受，更注重他们的行动及其文学意义。他的作品不仅充满“心”，更是对文学形式的精心雕琢。

紧接着，MJ·富兰克林推荐了**丹尼尔·穆纳丁**（Danielle Muenadine）的**《蛇居之地》**（This Is Where the Serpent Lives）。这部小说被誉为“俄罗斯文学巨著”般的经典、优雅和沉浸式体验。穆纳丁此前曾出版过一本备受好评的短篇小说集，并因此获得多项大奖提名。他的新书将他作为故事作家的天赋提升到了一个新高度，由四个相互关联、层层嵌套的故事组成，每个部分都围绕一个特定角色展开。

故事从被小吃摊老板收养的孤儿**亚兹德**（Yazid）开始，他最终成为一个巴基斯坦商人家庭的司机。这个家庭包括在美国学习并抢走兄弟女友的**希沙姆**（Hisham），以及他的表亲和亚兹德的门徒。小说巧妙地描绘了阶级、种姓和宗教分歧，但更重要的是，这些角色在彼此的生活中紧密交织。穆纳丁以其细致入微、错综复杂且易于理解的人物宇宙，构建了一个引人入胜的故事，让读者对巴基斯坦农场的黄瓜收成都能产生情感投入。这部作品充满魅力、幽默感，并因其深刻的人物塑造和情感共鸣而备受期待。

All right, I'll take the mantle. I have a very classic, elegant, immersive novel that is already getting comparisons, including from our own critic Dwight Garner to The Russian Great. This is called This Is Where the Serpent Lives by Danielle Muenadine. Muadine has written one book prior to this and it was a book of short stories and it zoomed like a comet across the critical universe and was shortlisted for all kinds of prizes and and wetted everybody's appetite. It's been a long time since then, several years at least. And in the meantime, he has been like this is a tick of mine. I hate when author bios say like he divides his time between like Paris and New York. It's okay. But this one is actually interesting. He divides his time between a farm in rural Pakistan and Oslo. Okay. Interesting. Now I'm interested. Yeah. So the novel I think takes his real skill as a story writer and scales it up because this is a book of four interlocking stories that nest inside each other. And each section follows a specific character. So in the beginning we meet this man named Yazid who was adopted by a food stall runner. This kid was left alone on the street and he takes him in and then he becomes this larger than-l life character. It's fascinating. And he becomes the driver for a family that includes a man named Hisham who is a Pakistani businessman and studied in the States and stole his brother's girlfriend who then became his wife. interesting and then his cousin and then the driver's protege and when I tell you I have never been interested or frankly invested in the welfare of a cucumber crop in Pakistani farms until now. If you can get emotionally invested in cucumbers and their outcomes, this is the book that will do it for you. It's fascinating. It's funny. It has that sort of like upstairs everybody's looking at me quizzically. I'm going to move on. No, no, no. Please don't. Keep going. It has that fun like upstairs, downstairs feeling to it because Yazid and then his protetéé are employees and they serve a longtime family. So, there are questions of class and even cast and religious division, but it's so much more than that because these are characters that are very intimately entwined in each other's lives. And I found it incredibly moving. And the way that Muenadine has this very detailed and intricate and understandable universe of characters. I loved it. It was like when I got my Barbie Dreamhouse, you know? That's how I felt. I am excited to read this one because I feel like what we're like 2, 3 weeks into the new year, but I already have FOMO. I feel like this book so far is your favorite's favorite book. I feel like it's been Dwight Garner loved it and he said, quote, "It's a serious book that you'll be hearing about again later in the year when the short list for the big prizes are announced. I feel like the people who have read it have loved this book and I'm excited to dive in. Yeah, I I'm very enthusiastic about this. It's uh it's good stuff." So, that was This Is Where the Serpent Lives by Danielle Muan, and it's out now. So, Gilbert, any non-fiction? Are you asking me because I'm a middle-aged man? No, but not No. Okay, I do. You know me so well. You know me so well. There's a book that comes out at the end of January. This comes out January 27th. and it's called Fear and Fury, the Reagan 80s, the Bernie Get Shootings, and the Rebirth of White Rage. Do either of you know who Bernie Gets is or had you heard the story of Bernie Gett before you'd heard about this book? I had not. Okay. Had you? I did. Yes. Okay. So, I'm talking to you, MJ. We're here. Yeah. In the early 80s, in 1984, there was this incident where a man, a white man on a train was approached by some black teenagers and they asked him for some money. You know, it was a dangerous time in New York. He felt threatened. He pulled out a gun that he should not have had and he shot all four of them on the subway. He paralyzed one of them. He ran to New England for 9 days or so and eventually came back. And it was a huge deal in New York. It was a big tabloid sensation. subway shooter. There were lots of people who were pro Bernie Gett like finally someone stood up for us all these people who feel like we are being scared by crime and young thugs on the subway and it was just a giant story here in New York City. So Heather N. Thompson who has won a Pulitzer Prize in history for a previous book that was a book that she wrote about Attica called Blood in the Water has taken this on and she lays out the case. But it's not just let's find an old piece of crime and write about it. She's also making argument for how this incident is one of the incidents that sort of preage a lot of what we're seeing now when it comes to vigilante justice, when it comes to what she calls white rage. It's a very ambitious book and it's a very big topic that she's taking on. It sounds both heartbreaking. Yeah. And ambitious and intense. Yeah, I think it will be. And crazily enough, there are two books coming out this month about the Bernie Geting. There's this one, Fear and Fury by Heather N. Thompson, and there's another one called Five Bullets, and that's by a man named Elliot Williams. He's a former federal prosecutor who used to work in the Justice Department in the Obama administration and he has also been a a legal analyst on CNN. And he also goes deep into the case, but I think he's approaching it more from a very legal perspective. I think both these books are approaching it from very different angles. But it is wild that we have two books about this thing coming out at the same time. MJ, I am pointing at you.

### 社会议题的深度剖析：历史与当代白人愤怒

接下来，编辑们将目光转向非虚构类作品，探讨深刻的社会议题。吉尔伯特·克鲁兹推荐了**海瑟·N·汤普森**（Heather N. Thompson）的**《恐惧与愤怒：里根时代80年代、伯尼·戈茨枪击案与白人愤怒的重生》**（Fear and Fury, the Reagan 80s, the Bernie Get Shootings, and the Rebirth of White Rage），该书将于1月27日出版。汤普森曾凭借关于阿提卡监狱暴动的著作**《血染之水》**（Blood in the Water）获得普利策历史奖。

这本书深入探讨了1984年发生在纽约地铁的一起轰动性事件：白人男子**伯尼·戈茨**（Bernie Goetz）在地铁上遭到四名黑人青少年的勒索后，开枪射伤了他们。这起事件在当时引发了巨大的社会争议，许多人支持戈茨，认为他代表了那些被犯罪和“年轻暴徒”吓倒的民众。汤普森不仅详细还原了这起案件，更重要的是，她将此事件置于更广阔的历史背景下，论证了它如何预示了当前社会中普遍存在的**义警式正义**（vigilante justice）以及她所称的“白人愤怒”（white rage）。这是一部雄心勃勃的著作，旨在探讨一个宏大而复杂的社会主题。

值得注意的是，本月将有两本关于伯尼·戈茨事件的书籍同时出版。除了汤普森的**《恐惧与愤怒》**，还有前联邦检察官、奥巴马政府司法部官员**埃利奥特·威廉姆斯**（Elliot Williams）的**《五颗子弹》**（Five Bullets）。威廉姆斯从法律角度深入剖析了这起案件。这两本书从不同视角切入同一事件，展现了其多维的复杂性。

<details>

Yes. I want to talk about Lost Lambs by Maline Cash, which is actually out now. This is a debut and it is pretty unhinged in such a fun way. It is about a self-destructing family. Each member is spiraling in his or her own way. We have parents who are in a not totally agreed upon agreement to have an open relationship. Meanwhile, there are children. They have three daughters. The oldest is dating someone who may or may not be a war criminal. The middle child feels forgotten as a middle child. So, she gets on her computer and she starts an online relationship with someone who may or may not be a terrorist. And then the youngest is a genius and she is very conspiracy theory-minded about what's going on in the town. But are these crazy conspiracy theories or is there a little bit of truth there? Read to find out. This book is wild and I What is going on? That's the right question for this book. I keep calling it Ryan Murphy gleecore in the way that Ryan Murphy could sell the most bonkers story lines and he sells it with a wink, but it's not too cheeky. It's an inland joke. It's all fun. That's what this book is. I am shocked that it's a debut because it has such an assured sensibility. Maline Cash can really sell a punchline. she can really rock a call back and it's a book to get lost into the high jinks of a small town where everything is a foot all of the time. This is one it's like the girls who get it get it and the girls who don't don't. You have to be in the right mentality. I read this over break during the twilight days between Christmas and New Year where I was just like get me something well done but so entertaining and so fun. That's the Lost Lambs by Maline Cash out now. Gilbert, you have a fiction title for us, right?

</details>

### 家庭关系与个人成长：从荒诞喜剧到严肃反思

在探讨完社会议题后，编辑们又回到了虚构文学的推荐。MJ·富兰克林介绍了**马琳·卡什**（Maline Cash）的处女作**《迷途羔羊》**（Lost Lambs），该书现已上市。这部小说以一种“脱缰”的有趣方式，讲述了一个自我毁灭的家庭故事，每个成员都以自己的方式陷入困境。父母处于一种未完全达成共识的开放关系中。他们的三个女儿也各有各的问题：大女儿与一位可能是战犯的人约会；二女儿觉得自己被忽视，于是开始与一个可能是恐怖分子的人发展网恋；最小的女儿是个天才，对小镇上发生的一切充满阴谋论。这本书充满了荒诞的情节和出人意料的转折，以一种巧妙而幽默的方式呈现了家庭的混乱与秘密。编辑称其为“瑞恩·墨菲式的狂欢”，充满了令人捧腹的桥段和巧妙的伏笔，展现了作者作为新人作家令人震惊的自信和成熟。

接下来，吉尔伯特·克鲁兹推荐了**珍妮特·麦柯迪**（Jennette McCurdy）的首部小说**《他年龄的一半》**（Half His Age），该书将于1月20日发行。麦柯迪曾是尼克儿童频道情景喜剧《爱卡莉》（iCarly）的联合主演，后因其回忆录**《我很高兴我的妈妈死了》**（I'm Glad My Mom Died）而广为人知，该书讲述了她年轻时与疯狂且虐待她的星妈之间的故事，曾登上《纽约时报》畅销书榜多周。

**《他年龄的一半》**是麦柯迪首次尝试小说创作，她声称自己一直想写小说。这本书的故事可能会让一些读者感到不适，因为它讲述了一个17岁高中生沃尔多（Waldo）与她的创意写作老师之间的性关系。这种情节设定在文学作品中并不少见，但通常由男性作家撰写。麦柯迪以其回忆录中展现出的“喜欢挑衅”的个性，选择这样一个敏感的主题，预示着她将以独特视角来处理这一复杂关系。编辑们对她如何驾驭这一题材，以及她从回忆录转向小说的体裁转变充满好奇，认为这体现了她无所畏惧的创作精神。

And then the youngest is a genius and she is very conspiracy theory-minded about what's going on in the town. But are these crazy conspiracy theories or is there a little bit of truth there? Read to find out. This book is wild and I What is going on? That's the right question for this book. I keep calling it Ryan Murphy gleecore in the way that Ryan Murphy could sell the most bonkers story lines and he sells it with a wink, but it's not too cheeky. It's an inland joke. It's all fun. That's what this book is. I am shocked that it's a debut because it has such an assured sensibility. Maline Cash can really sell a punchline. she can really rock a call back and it's a book to get lost into the high jinks of a small town where everything is a foot all of the time. This is one it's like the girls who get it get it and the girls who don't don't. You have to be in the right mentality. I read this over break during the twilight days between Christmas and New Year where I was just like get me something well done but so entertaining and so fun. That's the Lost Lambs by Maline Cash out now. Gilbert, you have a fiction title for us, right? I do. I am going to talk about Half His Age by Janette McCertie. This comes out January 20th. And this is the first novel from the former co-star of the Nickelodeon sitcom I Carly, who became known, further known to many people about four years ago when her book I'm Glad My Di came out. It was a memoir about her young life, about her crazy and abusive stage mother. It was a giant, giant hit. It was on the New York Times bestseller list for so many weeks. That was a memoir. This is her first attempt at a novel, which she claims she's always actually wanted to write fiction. This is a book with a a story that I think might turn some people off because what it is about it is about a 17-year-old high school senior. Her name is Waldo. Don't know why. Haven't read the book. And it's about Waldo and her relationship, her sexual relationship with her creative writing teacher. That plot framework alone, I feel like has a way of pushing a lot of people away because we've seen the story many, many times. primarily stories written by men. It'll be interesting to see what Janette Mccertie, who based on her memoir and the title of her memoir and her basic vibe likes to poke people. So, I'm I'm curious to see what this actually reads like. I'm curious, too, because her first book, her memoir wasn't just a book. It is such a phenomenon. Absolutely. And I feel like with a book that big, all eyes are on you for your sophomore effort. And choosing this subject matter proves that she's like fearless. She's willing to go there, talk about these third rail topics, and it's a genre pivot. I'm so curious how she pulls it off. That is Half his Age, Janette Mccertie, out January 20th. We'll be right back.

### 意识与感知的科学边界

欢迎回到《书评》播客。本周，编辑们继续分享他们对2026年前几个月新书的期待。朱曼娜·卡蒂布介绍了一部非虚构作品：**迈克尔·波伦**（Michael Pollan）的**《一个同伴世界：意识之旅》**（A World of Peers, a journey into consciousness），该书将于2月24日出版。波伦以其关于食物和饮食的著作（如**《杂食者的困境》**The Omnivore's Dilemma）而闻名，他之前的作品**《如何改变你的思维》**（How to Change Your Mind）已开始探索**迷幻剂**（psychedelics）如何影响我们具有可塑性的意识。

新书**《一个同伴世界》**则更像是一项对意识和感知能力的科学调查。波伦指出，科学界对意识的兴趣相对较新，大部分重大发现都发生在过去25到30年间。此前，意识问题甚至被认为不值得进行严谨的科学研究。直到**弗朗西斯·克里克**（Francis Crick: DNA双螺旋结构的共同发现者）等科学家提出应重视这一领域，科学界才逐渐开始接纳。波伦在书中概述了意识的构成要素，包括感知、思想、情感以及自我发展。尽管有时会让人感觉像哲学入门研讨会，但内容引人入胜。他还深入探讨了动物和植物的不同智能类型，并特别提到了**植物意识**（plant consciousness: 古老、无脑且基本不动）。这种对植物生命形式的独特解读，引发了编辑们关于生命本质和来世的有趣思考。

Welcome back. This is the book review podcast. I'm Gilbert Cruz and I am wonderfully joined this week by MJ Franklin and Jamanic Katib. We are talking about some books to look forward to over the next several months. Jumanna, I believe you have a piece of non-fiction. I sure do. So, this is a world appears, a journey into consciousness by Michael Pollen. This is coming out at the end of February, February 24th. So Paulen, you probably know, or if you've been to like any kind of vegetarian adjacent cafe, you've probably seen one of his quotes at the bottom of their menus. Eat mostly plants, not too much, you know, that whole thing. So he's best known for The Omnivore's Dilemma. And then actually his last book, How to Change Your Mind, from 2018 started looking at psychedelics and how they play with our very plastic consciousnesses. And so this book is a much more almost like scientific investigation into consciousness and sentience. And this is the moment where I have to admit that I have an extremely low tolerance for hearing about other people's experiences using drugs, particularly psychedelics. However, I am riveted by this. So, the book opens by talking about frankly how new the sort of degree of scientific interest in consciousness is. It was like the late 80s basically and most of the big discoveries have happened in the last 25 years, 30 years. It was basically dismissed as something that is not even worth thinking about, let alone applying scientific rigor to. And thank goodness, not for the first time, not for the last, for Francis Crick, who helped discover the double helix, who was like, actually, I think this is something we should look at. And then grudgingly the scientific community was like okay sure. So pollen outlines the elements of consciousness, sentience, thought, feeling, the development of a self. So it can get a little like freshman philosophy seminar in moments but it's really interesting and he even talks a lot about the different types of intelligence animal and plant. And I would just like to shout out plant consciousness and make a plea with whoever is in charge of how I am reincarnated because I would like to come back as a plant because tell me that this doesn't sound enviable. Plant consciousness is ancient, brainless, and largely immobile. Sign me up. Sign me I know. I'm hoping for next time. So that is A World of Peers by Michael Pollen coming out February 24th. You know my thoughts on plants. You eat them. Oh, no you don't. You famously don't eat them. You don't like house plants. I don't like house plants. Is it? Not that I don't like them. I just don't see the What is the point? Okay, I have to say this. So, I recently learned that when two dear friends of mine that are in a couple moved in together. One of them said, "You have too many house plants. We can't move this many into them into our new apartment." And for a long time I thought it was a space consideration, but then it turns out that the person was like, "I can't sleep in a room with house plants because they steal your oxygen and deprive your brain of oxygen." And I've never looked at her the same way. She's jealous of the house plant. Yeah, I know. It It's some real like single white spider plant. So like when I was a kid, my grandmother made me suspicious of cats because she said they steal your breath when you're sleeping. That is just so Yeah, I have two cats and I can tell you they are not capable of doing that. I love my cats dearly. They're so weird. They're not stealing anything. Wait, but why don't you like house plants? Like what what do they add? Greenery. Yeah. So, do you how do you feel about decorations, ornamentation? I love I love I love stuff on walls. I love stuff on But I'm going to tell you something drape over. Sometimes dirt gets out. You have to water them. And it's not like they don't. You do have to water them. Dirt should never be getting out just naturally. They sit in a pot. Plants don't love you back. Why do I need to love a plant? Oh, George Saunders, I think you would have an opinion on this. Okay, MJ, would you please take it away?

### 托妮·莫里森的文学遗产与批判性解读

在关于植物和家居装饰的轻松讨论之后，MJ·富兰克林转向了文学批评领域，推荐了两本关于**托妮·莫里森**（Toni Morrison: 诺贝尔文学奖得主，美国非裔文学巨匠）的重要著作。第一本是**纳马利·萨佩尔**（Namwali Serpell）的**《论莫里森》**（On Morrison），将于2月17日出版。萨佩尔是一位知名小说家、散文家、评论家和教授，她的两部小说**《旧漂流》**（The Old Drift）和**《犁沟》**（The Furrows）都备受赞誉。

**《论莫里森》**是萨佩尔在哈佛大学教授托妮·莫里森课程的论文集。每篇文章都深入剖析莫里森的一部具体作品，并将其与莫里森所探索的更广泛的文化、黑人或文学思想联系起来。例如，书中可能包含关于命名、符号学、面具或爵士乐的论文。莫里森的作品以其深刻、密集且极具文学价值而闻名，但有时也需要一位“向导”来帮助读者理解。萨佩尔的这本书正是扮演了这一角色。尽管内容学术性较强，需要读者投入精力，但对于热爱优秀文学批评、细读和托妮·莫里森的读者来说，这将是必读之作。编辑表示，即使她已经阅读了莫里森60%的作品，这本书也让她渴望重读，并对未读作品充满期待。

第二本推荐是**托妮·莫里森**本人的非虚构作品**《作为解放的语言》**（Language as Liberation），将于2月3日出版。这本书收录了莫里森生前关于美国文学经典的讲座和散文，她在其中深入探讨了美国文学中“黑人身份”的呈现。这部作品为读者提供了一个前所未有的宝贵视角，了解这位标志性作家如何解读其他美国文学巨匠。这两本书都具有高度的学术价值，但萨佩尔的**《论莫里森》**尤其适合读者根据兴趣选择章节阅读，即使是莫里森的入门读者也能从中受益，因为它既易于理解又具有学术深度。

Absolutely. I also have a non-fiction title and that is on Morrison by Nomali Surpel which is out on February 17th. Namali Surel you may be familiar with because of her fiction. She has two novels the old drift and the furrows both of which are incredible. The Furrows was a New York Times best book of the year when it came out. I love that book. Nomali in addition to being a novelist is also an essayist and critic and a professor and a Tony Morrison scholar. And then this is what that book is. This is a collection of essays based on Nomali Sappella's Harvard course on Tony Morrison. And each essay tackles a specific Morrison book and connects that to a larger cultural black or literary idea that Morrison has explored. So there might be an essay about naming insula or signifying or masks or jazz and you're just with Nomali repel as she breaks down these Tony Morrison books. Morrison is an icon number one but number two is famously dense literary rewarding but sometimes you read a Tony Morrison novel and you're like I wish I had a guide. That is who Namali Sappel is here in this book. The book is pretty academic. Again, it started out as a college class. And so I actually read it. I had like a pen and a pad and I was writing down number one just the words I didn't know and then all of the literary terms that I didn't know. You have to put a lot of yourself into this book. But if you love good literary criticism, if you love close reading, if you love Tony Morrison, I think this is one that you will absolutely want on your reading list. I've read, I want to say 60% of Tony Morrison's books, and even the ones that I have read, I wanted to go back and reread with the knowledge that I gained from this essay collection. And then the ones that I hadn't read, I was eager to pick up. I'm going to shoehorn a second recommendation in here and that is language as liberation and that's also non-fiction a collection of essays and lectures but this one is by Tony Morrison herself. Tony Morrison we know as a novelist but she was also a professor and she taught a course before she died about the American cannon and she reads blackness into the American cannon and this February February 3rd those lectures are being released as this book language as liberation again academic you got to study it but it's just like an unprecedented and invaluable peak into how one of our most iconic authors read our other iconic authors. Is this a book that if like you, you've only read some Tony Morrison, not all of Tony Morrison, you could target the chapters of the the books that you want to read about? That's always my concern with collections of criticism. It's like I I'm obviously not going to read all this. I haven't read all of Tony Morrison. Absolutely. Because each essay is specifically one book, one idea. You can pick and choose your adventure. But also I would say even if you haven't read anything, this is a good primer on Tony Morrison. It's a good introduction to these books and her ideas. But then if you have read Tony Morrison, it's not like oh I've read this before. It's accessible but also scholarly, smart, fresh, open to all. That is on Morrison by Nomali Sarpel out February 17th and also language as liberation by Tony Morrison out February 3rd. So that's what I got. Jima, what about you? got anything else for February?

### 当代生活群像：友情、婚姻与社会变迁

进入二月，朱曼娜·卡蒂布推荐了两部风格迥异的小说。首先是**艾米丽·内曼斯**（Emily Nemans）的**《湖泊效应》**（Clutch），将于2月3日出版。这部小说被誉为“千禧一代”对玛丽·麦卡锡（Mary McCarthy）经典作品**《团体》**（The Group）的精彩重述。**《团体》**讲述了八位瓦萨学院（Vassar）校友在纽约的生活和困境，而**《湖泊效应》**则聚焦于一群大约40岁的女性朋友，在三个繁忙的月份里，她们经历了葬礼、婚姻破裂、精神病发作，甚至还有柯基犬冻伤等一系列事件。

这部小说的独特之处在于，五位女性角色都没有被塑造成刻板印象或原型，而是具有鲜明的文化特征。例如，其中一位名叫格雷格（Greg）的角色是德克萨斯州的进步派立法者，曾因在国会大厦哺乳和敲击牛仔靴以表达观点而走红。她嫁给了一位“马斯克式”的太空竞赛亿万富翁，后者服用减肥药并杀害了数百万只滨鸟。此外，还有小说家、高级律师和与不孕症作斗争的人。内曼斯巧妙地将中年人面临的各种深思熟虑且普遍存在的问题和挑战融入故事中。尽管情节充满了混乱甚至有些“精神错乱”的时刻，但作者对故事的掌控力极强，笔触充满幽默感和同理心，让读者在阅读过程中感到舒适和愉悦。

接着，朱曼娜推荐了**丽贝卡·诺瓦克**（Rebecca Novak）的**《谋杀荡妇》**（Murder Bimbo），将于2月10日出版。这部小说以其引人注目的标题和扣人心弦的情节吸引了编辑的注意。故事开篇，一名女性在对一位极具争议的政治家（她称之为“肉脖子”）实施暴力行为后逃入森林。她向一位播客主持人讲述了自己的故事，揭露了自己曾是一名性工作者，并被卧底特工招募去扳倒这位政治家。

**《谋杀荡妇》**在文学手法上进行了大胆创新，其三个章节的“事实”或主要情节保持不变——性工作者、谋杀、被唾弃的政治家、卧底行动——但具体情况却不断发生细微变化，让读者始终在猜测真相。这种叙事结构让人联想到劳伦·格罗夫（Lauren Groff）的**《命运与复仇》**（Fates and Furies），通过不同角色的视角展现同一事件的不同面貌，从而制造出一种不稳定且怪异的阅读体验。尽管情节疯狂，但书中对政治的探讨深思熟虑、逻辑严谨，并非为政治而政治，这被编辑们视为一项重要的成就。

<details>
<summary>Original English Source</summary>

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. This is my month. I always love February anyway. So, okay. So, the first one I'm going to talk about is a novel called Clutch by Emily Nemans. This is coming out on February 3rd. This is like the great millennial retelling of the group, the Mary McCarthy book about eight friends who met at Vasser and their foibless and travails in New York. But, you know, with a difference because those women were in their early 20s, like really just starting out their lives. And the women in Clutch are 40, give or take a couple months. and we follow them over three very busy months in their lives. We're talking a funeral, marital implosions, psychosis, corgi frostbite, that's a big subplot. And what I really like about this book is that none of the five women feel overly like stereotypes or even archetypes. The characters are very culturally on the nose. So, for example, one character, her name is Greg. She is a progressive legislator in Texas who's gone viral for breastfeeding on the Capitol floor and banging her cowboy boot on the table to get a point across. And she's married to this muskesque space race billionaire who's on ompic and has killed a million shorebirds. and there's a novelist and there's a high-powered lawyer and somebody struggling with infertility. So, she really wraps up a lot of thoughtful and and all-encompassing problems or challenges that people at that stage of life face. And this is a classic formula looking at a group of friends over space and time as they confront the quotidian and inevitable outcomes in life. your parents get old, your kids grow up, your marriages falter, but she's so in command of this story, it actually gives you the feeling like, oh, everything's going to be okay. I don't actually know what's going to happen in my millennial cohort, but like these friends, even when things go catastrophically wrong, you feel comforted or like it it's a real pleasure to settle into read. I was not expecting that kind of cozy vibe based on the series of dilemmas you listed off when you first started describing this. Oh, yeah. And it is fully deranged in moments. There's a lot that's just totally demented, but I you can tell that she has a she has a very the author has a very high EQ and a sense of humor and she's companionable. You're happy to be in her in her hands for however long the book is. companionable and demented, two words that I'm like, sign me up. And then I have another novel for February. This is not companionable or cozy at all, which you might get from the title. This is called Murder Bimbo by Rebecca Novak, coming out February 10th. Such a good title. What a title. Such a good title. Obviously, I'm like professionally bound to read a book called Murder Bimbo. And I was really, really interested in this. This is doing something totally fascinating and unexpected from a literary point of view. So it opens, this woman has just fled to the woods after committing a heinous act, which is committing an act of violence against a very divisive politician that she refers to as meat neck throughout the narrative. And she's writing this to a podcast host who I think with progressive values who kind of re-evaluates instances of where the public has gone public favor has gone in like an unfair direction. And she talks about how she was a sex worker and recruited by undercover agents to like take down this politician. It's nuts. And you learn things about her along the way, but you learn things about the mission. It feels like oceans 11y kind of which is a movie I have seen. So the thing with murder bimbo is that each of its three sections the facts or the the big moving shapes are the same. Sex worker murder politician reviled politician undercover work but the circumstances change ever so slightly so you're left wondering what the actual truth is. It's like Fates and Furies the Lauren Grath book. Love that book. Yep. Yep. And where and that's the book where you hear the story of a marriage from one spouse's perspective and then the complete opposite or almost the opposite perspective from the other spouse. And it's destabilizing and and weird. It's got a little bit of like biography of X or sort of trust exercise, but this is it's a romp. You know, the sex worker's having fun and we're having fun with her. And the other thing that I have to say is whatever your own politics are, I do think that if you are going to make politics a central point of your novel, they need to be coherent and they like the politics have to be there for a reason. This was my problem with Creation Lake among other things. But the politics in this novel are thought through and cogent and they are there for a reason. And I thought that that was an accomplishment. All right, MJ, how about you?

### 跨越时代的女性友谊与成长史诗

MJ·富兰克林继续推荐了**塔亚里·琼斯**（Tayari Jones）的**《亲族》**（Kin），该书将于2月24日出版。这是琼斯继六年前备受赞誉的**《美国婚姻》**（An American Marriage）之后的又一力作，后者曾被奥巴马总统列为年度最爱书籍之一，并被《纽约时报》评为21世纪百部最佳图书之一。

**《亲族》**讲述了一个不同类型的故事，聚焦于两个没有母亲的女孩——尼（Ni）和安妮（Annie）。尼的母亲在她婴儿时期被父亲谋杀，父亲随后自杀；而安妮的母亲则在她婴儿时期离家出走。这两个孤儿女孩成为了彼此的家人和“摇篮之友”，小说追随她们一生，展现了她们在成长过程中如何选择不同的人生道路，寻找自我，并最终找到她们从未拥有的“母亲”。

这部历史小说背景设定在20世纪50年代和60年代的吉姆·克劳法（Jim Crow laws: 19世纪末至20世纪中期美国南部和边境州实施的种族隔离和歧视性法律）时期的美国南部，充满了丰富的细节和深刻的内涵。它不仅是一个关于友谊和姐妹情谊的故事，也是一个关于成长的故事。琼斯以其精湛的叙事技巧，将读者完全沉浸在这两个角色的世界中，感受她们改变命运、拯救彼此的友谊。小说深入探讨了年轻女性在背负家庭重担的情况下如何驾驭生活，让读者感觉这些女孩就像自己的朋友、家人和姐妹一样，对其命运投入了深厚的情感。编辑们一致认为，这部作品并非试图“重新发明轮子”，而是在“完善轮子”，以无可挑剔的笔触，将姐妹情谊和友谊的故事演绎到极致。

Before we get to my title, I have two follow-ups. One is I loved Creation League. Oh, yeah. I had a lot of fun with Creation League. Two, you mentioned Lauren Grath and Muna Shoehorn. She has a new book coming out too in February, February 24th, Brawler. But the book I wanted to mention is Kin by Tari Jones. Also out on February 24th. This is Tiari Jones's return after about 6 years. She wrote An American Marriage, which was huge, iconic. I think it was an Obama favorite book. It's an incredible novel, one of our hundred best books of the 21st century. It is so good. This book is a different type of story that was about an American marriage. This is about two girls, Ni and Annie, both of whom don't have mothers. Ni's mother is murdered by Ni's father when Ni's a baby, and then the father kills himself, while Annie's mother runs away when she's a baby. orphaned. These two girls become each other's family. They become each other's cradle friends, and we follow them over the course of their lives as they take different paths to growing up and finding themselves and finding the mothers that they never had. There's a lot going on here in such a fantastic way. It's a historical novel and that it's set in the 50s and 60s in the Jim Coral South. It's the story of friendship and sisterhood. It's a coming of age story and think of it like like books like The Vanishing Half or Shred Sisters or Lonely Crowds. You're just immersed in these two characters and their completely lifech changing and life-saving friendship and it's a look at these young women navigating life with all of the baggage of family. It is a novel to you just you just feel like these girls are your friends. They're your family. They're your sisters. You're so invested in them. And I loved it. You've been talking about this for a while very persuasively. Yeah. Yeah. You've read it, too, I did. I read it in one gulp. I was at home. Hold my call. It's really, really good. What I love about books like this is that these are not books that are trying to reinvent the wheel. These are books that are perfecting the wheel. You have read stories of sisterhood. You've read stories of friendship. You have not read a story of sisterhood of friendship just this immaculately done. It's so good. So again, that's Ken by Tiari Jones and that's coming out on February 24th. I'm pointing to you, Gilbert. You're in the hot seat.

### 真实犯罪与地域文化：奥扎克山的谜团

进入三月，吉尔伯特·克鲁兹推荐了一部非虚构作品：**本杰明·黑尔**（Benjamin Hail）的**《洞穴山：奥扎克山的失踪与清算》**（Cave Mountain: A Disappearance and a Reckoning in the Ozarks），该书将于3月3日出版。这个故事最初发表在2023年的《哈珀杂志》（Harper's Magazine）上，讲述了一个令人毛骨悚然的真实事件。

故事围绕作者的表妹在阿肯色州奥扎克山（Ozarks）徒步旅行时失踪的事件展开。几天后，女孩被找到，虽然脱水且精神恍惚，但她声称在失踪期间有一位“想象中的朋友”陪伴。作者随后发现，几十年前在同一地区，另一位年轻女孩也曾失踪，并最终被一个邪教组织谋杀。黑尔将这两个故事并置，并非暗示它们之间存在直接联系，而是通过这种方式，深入探讨美国阿肯色州奥扎克山地区的独特文化、他的家族历史、真实犯罪现象以及该地区所承载的各种复杂议题。

编辑们对这本书如何将一篇引人入胜的杂志文章扩展成一部完整的著作表示好奇。他们指出，许多非虚构作品有时读起来更像一篇冗长的杂志文章，甚至只是一条推文。然而，黑尔最初的故事本身就充满悬念和悲剧色彩，令人回味无穷。因此，人们期待**《洞穴山》**能以更深入的笔触，充分展现这个地区和这些故事的丰富内涵，避免沦为一篇简单的扩写文章。

<details>
<summary>Original English Source</summary>

I am going to talk about a March book. This is a book that comes out March 3rd. It is called Cave Mountain: A Disappearance and a Reckoning in the Ozarks by Benjamin Hail. So, this initially started as a story that read in Harper's Magazine in 2023, which some listeners might recall. That story detailed the disappearance of a young girl. This young girl was the author's cousin. She was hiking with her grandparents, I believe, in the Ozarks in Arkansas, and she went missing. And luckily they found her a couple of days later. And when they did, she was dehydrated and discombobulated. And she also spoke of being accompanied over the past several days by quote an imaginary friend, which is slightly creepy. The author finds out that decades earlier in that same general area, there was another young girl who disappeared. She met a terrible end. She was murdered by a religious cult. And he puts these two stories side by side. And I don't believe not having read the full book, but having read the story that there is a direct connection that he is indicating between these two things. And by putting these two stories together, he's trying to tell a tale about this part of America, the Arkansas Ozarks. He is reflecting on that region, on his family, on on true crime, on all sorts of things. You know, I'm curious to see how this book takes this story, which I thought was told pretty well in the Harper's Piece, and fleshes it out to a full read. We have all read stories, non-fiction stories, which were like I just felt like a long magazine piece. Could have been an article. Could have been an article. Article could have been a tweet. Book could have been an article. I'm hoping that's not the case with this because it is in its initial form a story that was very creepy and very sad in its own way and really lingered after I read it. So that's Cave Mountain by Benjamin Hail. That is out March 3rd. Shumana.

### 家族秘辛与历史回响：多维叙事下的命运交织

朱曼娜·卡蒂布继续推荐了**辛西娅·德阿普里克斯·斯威尼**（Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney）的**《湖泊效应》**（Lake Effect），该书将于3月3日出版。斯威尼是畅销书**《鸟巢》**（The Nest）和**《好公司》**（Good Company）的作者，她擅长描绘家庭如何以灾难性但又可爱的方式走到一起。**《鸟巢》**讲述了四兄妹争夺家族遗产的故事，而**《好公司》**则描绘了两对夫妇几十年来分分合合的经历。

**《湖泊效应》**延续了斯威尼的这一风格，故事始于1977年的罗切斯特，一个充满年代感的背景。故事的女主人公购买了多本**《性爱的乐趣》**（The Joy of Sex）分发给朋友，暗示了那个时代的社会风气。在故事的第一部分结束时，两对邻居夫妇发生了婚外情，并飞往多米尼加共和国办理了“闪电离婚”，这彻底重塑了他们的家庭结构。故事随后跳跃到未来，审视这些事件对孩子们的影响以及由此产生的深远后果。如果读者喜欢那种充满混乱但又温馨的大家庭故事，那么这本书无疑是理想之选。尽管书中充满了各种困境和“精神错乱”的时刻，但作者对故事的掌控力极强，笔触充满幽默感和同理心，让读者在阅读过程中感到舒适和愉悦。

吉尔伯特·克鲁兹则推荐了**阿尔瓦罗·恩里克**（Álvaro Enrigue）的**《现在我投降》**（Now I Surrender），同样于3月3日出版。恩里克上一部作品**《你梦想中的帝国》**（You Dreamed of Empires）曾被评为2024年十大最佳书籍之一，那是一部深刻的历史小说，背景设定在1519年，想象了西班牙征服者和阿兹特克人之间的首次互动，描绘了埃尔南·科尔特斯（Hernán Cortés）抵达墨西哥城并遭遇阿兹特克皇帝蒙特祖玛（Moctezuma）的故事。那部作品以其浓郁的感官描写和独特的活力令人难忘，充满了原始的、贴近自然的元素。

**《现在我投降》**同样是一部以历史为背景的小说，它融合了多条故事情节。其中一条线索是关于著名的印第安领袖**杰罗尼莫**（Geronimo: 19世纪阿帕奇部落的著名军事领袖）的故事，另一条线索则讲述了一个在遥远未来穿越美国西南部进行公路旅行的家庭。恩里克的作品以其纯粹的创造力和想象力而著称，他能够将这些特质融入小说中，无论触及何种历史题材，都能使其焕发新生。编辑们对这部作品充满期待，认为恩里克是一位值得关注的作家。

Okay, we're going to move away from disturbing family lore and go into some frothy fictional family foibless. You did it. I landed it. All right. So, this is Lake Effect by Cynthia Depri Sweeney. This is coming out on March 3rd. The author is the best-selling writer of The Nest and Good Company. And she's really eaked out a leg or a point of view for herself with sort of families come together with disastrous but kind of lovable results. The Nest was about four siblings squabbbling over their family inheritance or lack thereof. And Good Company was about two couples and falling in and out over the decades. So, this is squarely in that vein. It opens in 1977 Rochester, which is so precise you can almost smell it. And smells great. Smells great. And our heroine is appropriately buying up multiple copies of The Joy of Sex to hand around to her friends. By the time, and this is not, none of this is a spoiler. At the same time, and by the time that the first part comes to a close, two neighbors will have had an affair with each other and flown to the Dominican Republic to have a shotgun divorce, I guess. And this, of course, totally rearranges their families. And then the story lurches into the future and looks at the effects on the kids and the way that the ramifications of all of this. And if you like the kind of big messy family with a little bit of froth, I think this is definitely a book for you. So that is Lake Effect by Cynthia Dri Sweeney. Gilbert, what do you have? I have a book that comes out like the last one I mentioned also on March 3rd. This is Now I Surrender by Alvaro Enrique. I know you both know who this is and you both remember his last book because it was one of our top 10 books of 2024. That book you dreamed of empires was a piece of deep historical fiction. It was set in 1519 and it's imagined the first interaction between the concistadors and and the Aztecs. It's Hernand Cortez. He comes to what is now Mexico City. He encounters the emperor Mcdazzuma who is a bit dissolute at this point. Taken a lot of mushrooms, a lot of psychedelics. It is a book that I think about not infrequently because of how reolent it was, how sensory it was. You know, I've read a lot of historical fiction and this one just seemed very elemental, very close to the elements. This one is also a piece of largely historical fiction. It takes several storylines. One of them is about Donimo, very famous indigenous leader. He's an Apache leader. It's about a family also that far in the future is traveling through the American Southwest on a bit of a road trip. I cannot say I would have been excited for an Alvaro Enrique book if I had not read You Dreamed of Empires, which was just so the writing was so unique and vibrant and odd in its own way. I'm very much looking forward to this one. One thing that's great about Alvaro is similar to George Saunders, just the sheer creativity and imagination that he's able to channel into these novels and just transform whatever it touches, whether whatever history that is. He's a writer to watch. I'm excited. Ditto. Okay, I'm gonna slide in, take the last bit. And I'm so happy that the calendar shook out this way because I can talk about the final the third and final installment in Tana French's Cal Hooper series. This is called The Keeper. This is coming out on March 31st. So, we're getting in just under the wire.

So, Tana French, of course, is the wildly popular mystery and thriller writer. I think she's best known for the Dublin Murder Squad books, which picked up with different detectives. And so, this is a slightly different series. This follows an American detective named Cal who's picked up and left Chicago and settled in the tiny backwater village of Ardelty, Ireland. So over the course of his story, we've seen him slowly work his way into the community, which is not accustomed to interlopers. And so by the time that we meet him now, he's got a fiance. He's got drinking buddies in the pub. He's got like a a not an official foster child, but like, you know, he's hanging out with a teenager that he's helping get back on the right path and making furniture and enjoying life until a young woman is found dead in a river. And of course, being a small town, the town is consumed with this. It's also complicated because the young woman in question was engaged to the son of the most powerful influential man in town. So this immediately becomes a big question about it's like an existential question, right? Suspicious. It is suspicious. Yes. Auntie Freeze Rivers, can you come look at my kitten? It it becomes so existential. This murder reroutes intimate relationships. It changes the way people relate to the town. It changes the future of the town itself. It's got all the elements of what we like in a ton of French. It's very character-driven. There's some good dialogue. The way she renders Irish brogues on the page is quite a feat. So, I'm excited and and you know, I'm excited to see what she does next. Bringing a series to a close, that means she has to have something else on her mind. So that's The Keeper by Tana French coming on March 31st. It feels like we just talked about so many books and yet I want to just throw out very quickly without any context subtitles that are coming out over January, February, and March. In January, we have a new book by Carl Oowskar, The School of Night. Colleen Hoover has a new book, Woman Down, coming out in January. Speaking of thrillers, in February, we have a new Yo Nesbo book, Wolf Hour, that comes out February 3rd. As MJ mentioned, Lauren Grath has a collection of short stories out February 24th called Brawler. In March, there's a new novel by Abby Jimenez titled The Night We Met. Louise Erdrich has a collection of short stories as well titled Python's Kiss. So, those are just a few extra titles coming out over the next several months. MJ, Jima, I hope that listeners feel like we've actually given them some books that they could discover over the next several months. I think we have a tremendous range. We have Unhinged, we have good family stories, we have deep non-fiction, and we have a lot of murder. What else could you want? Jumanna, thank you so much as always for being on the Book Review Podcast. Thank you for having me. What a blast. MJ, you often host this podcast. So, the fact that you have joined and you did not demand to sit in the seat that I'm sitting in, I take as a compliment. Thank you for joining. I would never do a house takeover. I'm such a fan of these preview episodes. I love listening to you two. So, it's a privilege to get to join. That was my conversation with Juanak and MJ Franklin looking at the first three months of this year in books. I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the New York Times Book Review. Thanks for listening.
