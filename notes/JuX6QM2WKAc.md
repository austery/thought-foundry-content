### Z 世代的价值观观察

I teach Gen Z every single day. I mean, every semester, hundreds of students. So my shock was perhaps less than the rest of the team because I'm in the room with them now. NYU students are not quite as representative of Gen Z as outside of them. These are MBAs, so they tend to have a little bit more gear going on.

我每天都在教 Z 世代。我的意思是，每个学期都有几百名学生。所以我的震惊可能不如团队其他成员那么大，因为我现在就在他们中间。纽约大学的学生并不完全像校外的 Z 世代那样具有代表性。他们是 MBA 学生，所以他们往往拥有一点更多的“装备”（指能力或潜力）。

### 价值观研究方法与发现

I think that when we saw the 2% number, which we can get to, we were all like, we checked it about 35 times because we thought that is so much in that number. So what we did is we have a tool called the Values Bridge, which we developed in in our labs. And what it does is it ranks your values from 1 to 16, your personal values from 1 to 16. And so we now 75,000 people have taken this test. But at the time we did the research, it was 45,000 people and we were able to cut it by generation and we were able to see Gen Z's values ranked from 1 to 16, and their number one value was something we call utopia, which is encompasses self care, recreation, leisure, fun, employment. You know, just so like John Tucker Paul, I think we all know somebody was due to money is their number one value. Number two is authentic self-expression voice as we call it. And number three was the desire to organize their life around helping other people, which is very admirable, I would say.

我认为，当我们看到 2% 这个数字时——我们可以稍后详细说明——我们都觉得，我们检查了大约 35 次，因为我们觉得这个数字太令人难以置信了。所以我们所做的是，我们有一个名为“价值观桥梁”的工具，这是我们在实验室开发的。它的作用是将你的价值观从 1 排到 16，你的个人价值观从 1 排到 16。现在已有 75,000 人参加了这项测试。但在我们进行研究时，有 45,000 人，我们可以按代际进行分类，并看到 Z 世代的价值观排名从 1 到 16。他们的头号价值观是我们称之为“乌托邦”的东西，它涵盖了自我照顾、娱乐、休闲、乐趣、就业。你知道，就像约翰·塔克·保罗一样，我想我们都认识某人，他们的头号价值观是金钱。第二名是我们称之为“真实自我表达”（声音）。第三名是围绕帮助他人来组织生活的愿望，我认为这非常值得称赞。

### 企业雇主期望的价值观

But after I saw those top three values, I thought, I wonder what hiring managers are looking for, because my students are going out into the world to get hired. I have four adult children who are fighting out there in the world every day. So we did a separate study and we replicated it twice after that to to say, okay, here are the definitions of all the values. Hiring managers in knowledge industries, a mainly business. It was tech, it was it was accounting, finance and so forth. The consulting. What values are you looking for? And lo and behold, they were looking for the number one value of achievement, the desire to have success that other people can see. Number two was a desire for learning, stimulation and growth. And the third value was work centrism, the desire to work hard.

但在我看到这三个顶尖价值观后，我想，我很好奇招聘经理在寻找什么，因为我的学生们正走向社会去寻找工作。我有四个成年的孩子，他们每天都在这个世界上奋力拼搏。所以我们进行了另一项独立研究，之后又重复了两次，目的是说，“好的，这里是所有价值观的定义。”知识产业的招聘经理，主要是商业领域。有科技、会计、金融等等。咨询行业。你们在寻找什么价值观？结果出人意料，他们正在寻找头号价值观——成就，即拥有他人可见的成功。第二名是对学习、激励和成长的渴望。第三个价值观是工作中心主义，即努力工作的愿望。

### Z 世代价值观与企业期望的差距

And when you cross reference those two data sets, it ends up that it's just 2% of Gen Z that have the values that hiring managers are looking for.

当你交叉引用这两个数据集时，结果发现，只有 2% 的 Z 世代拥有招聘经理正在寻找的价值观。

### Z 世代价值观形成的潜在原因

It's interesting for Gen Z adjacent kind of offspring, they're all employed, but they tell me their first memories of my oldest were 911. That's their first memory. Yeah. And then they had, you know, the great financial crisis, right? Their parents are impacted. Everybody's parents are back Then they had the pandemic. So they've had some stuff, you know, and I wonder if that influences kind of how they the view the world. Yeah I think they don't want to buy into a deal that their parents bought into that didn't work out for a lot of their parents. I mean, you can you can come up with a hundred reasons why they had these values and they're entitled to them. I think that the problem is values have consequences. And so some of them also have affluence as a top value. And then they are very frustrated and frustrated to the point of kind of anger that they don't get to have affluence also as an output, if you had the value self-care number one. Yeah, so they can have their. But I don't you know how they came by their values. I get it. There's a million reasons. I mean, their parents might be to blame. I mean, with the torrent of letters that came to them, letters to the editor after the article, when a lot of people had a lot of people they wanted to blame for this phenomenon. Yep.

对于 Z 世代的近亲（指他们的后代）来说，这很有趣，他们都已就业。但他们告诉我，我大儿子最早的记忆是 911 事件。那是他最早的记忆。是的。然后他们经历了，你知道，大金融危机，对吧？他们的父母受到了影响。每个人的父母都受到了影响。然后他们经历了疫情。所以他们经历了一些事情，你知道，我想知道这是否影响了他们看待世界的方式。是的，我认为他们不想接受他们父母曾经接受过的，但对他们许多父母来说并未奏效的交易。我的意思是，你可以找出一百个他们拥有这些价值观的原因，并且他们有权拥有这些价值观。我认为问题在于价值观会带来后果。所以他们中的一些人也将富裕作为首要价值观。然后他们感到非常沮丧，沮丧到近乎愤怒，因为如果他们将自我照顾视为首要价值观，他们也无法获得富裕作为回报。是的，所以他们可以拥有他们的。但我不知道，你知道他们是如何获得这些价值观的。我明白了。有无数的原因。我的意思是，他们的父母可能要负责。我的意思是，在文章发表后，他们收到了海量的来信，读者来信，很多人想把这个现象归咎于别人。是的。

### 企业如何应对 Z 世代的价值观差异

What does corporate America do here is called America. Just you think that or to the students just or do they just trying to find some common ground? Maybe this is the million dollar question. So I've talked to a lot of business leaders since the piece came out. And so the companies with brand equity who can go higher, the 2% are out looking for them earlier. And one executive said to me, this is a cage match. We're willing to fight. All right. They're going to go find that 2%. They're going to they know where they are. They're going to go get them earlier and they're going to lock them down. And then other companies are going to have to figure out what to do about the fact that they're not going to be hiring young people who share their company values. And do they accommodate them or do they try to slowly move them over to a different way of thinking? It's very hard to talk people out of their values.

美国的企业该怎么做？你认为他们应该怎么做，或者对学生来说，他们是在试图找到一些共同点吗？这也许是价值百万美元的问题。自那篇文章发布以来，我与许多商界领袖进行了交谈。因此，那些拥有品牌声誉、能够支付更高薪酬的公司，正在更早地寻找那 2% 的人才。一位高管对我说：“这是一场残酷的竞争。我们愿意为此而战。”好吧。他们会去寻找那 2%。他们知道他们在哪里。他们会更早地去争取他们，并把他们“锁定”。然后其他公司将不得不弄清楚该如何处理他们将无法招聘到认同公司价值观的年轻人的事实。他们是应该迁就他们，还是试图慢慢地让他们接受一种不同的思维方式？让人们放弃他们的价值观是非常困难的。

### MBA 学生中的价值观现象

However, what do you find in the MBA program? Because you said those people kind of self-select they that they want to achieve, presumably. But again, I would suspect you see some of that in your class. I mean, I see a preponderance of eudaimonia self-care being a top value. I do have MBAs, okay? And so and in particular the MBA were majoring in finance. Those are they have a lot of the values that companies are looking for, and they're picked off pretty early. I but I don't think this is true in colleges in general. And I think there's a few. And this is what I mean is that companies are going to figure out where the 2% are and they're going to come get them and they're going to get them early.

然而，你在 MBA 项目中发现了什么？因为你说那些人有点是自我选择的，他们希望取得成就，大概是这样。但同样，我怀疑你在课堂上也能看到一些这种情况。我的意思是，我看到自我照顾（eudaimonia）被视为首要价值观的比例很高。我确实有 MBA 学生，好吧？特别是那些主修金融的 MBA 学生。他们拥有许多公司正在寻找的价值观，并且他们被很早就“挖走了”。但我认为这在普通大学里并不普遍。我认为情况是这样的：公司将找出那 2% 的人在哪里，然后他们会去找他们，并且会尽早找到他们。

### Z 世代的抗拒与反思

So how about for these these kids, though? I mean, do they do they recognize that maybe they are, in fact, different from certain maybe their parents and maybe the grandparents and others? And they they're defiant and they're okay with that? No, they're defiant. I mean, they're not just okay. They're they're they're defiant. They're like you. I mean, the letters from Gen Z that I got, the emails were like, hey, shut up over there, lady, because you ruined the world. You boomer people ruined the world. And our response is this. Why would we want your values? Look what you did to us with climate change and terrorism and school shootings. You created this world. Why would we buy your version of events?

那么，对于这些孩子们来说呢？我的意思是，他们是否认识到，事实上，他们可能与他们的父母、祖父母以及其他人有所不同？而且他们是反叛的，并且对此感到满意吗？不，他们是反叛的。我的意思是，他们不仅仅是满意。他们是反叛的。他们就像你一样。我的意思是，我收到的 Z 世代的来信，电子邮件都说：“嘿，女士，在那里闭嘴，因为是你们毁了世界。你们这些婴儿潮一代毁了世界。”我们的回应是：“我们为什么要接受你们的价值观？看看你们对我们造成的，比如气候变化、恐怖主义和校园枪击事件。是你们创造了这个世界。我们为什么要接受你们的说法？”
