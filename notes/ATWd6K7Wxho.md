title: 移民威胁欧洲？经济学人事实核查
summary: 本文深入分析了关于大规模移民对欧洲安全和文化构成威胁的说法。通过引用数据和研究，文章驳斥了“文明消失”和犯罪率飙升的论调，指出欧洲凶杀率自1990年代以来下降，且移民犯罪率的统计存在复杂因素，如年龄、经济状况和司法程序。同时，文章也承认移民带来的文化张力、融入挑战以及特定犯罪（如性暴力）的过高代表性，并强调有序移民和合法就业的重要性。

### 移民与欧洲安全

**分析师**: 移民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: immigrants.

</details>

**分析师**: 他们是罪犯。那个国家就是没道理地不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> They're criminals. That country is no good for a reason.

</details>

**分析师**: 数十万人大规模移民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> Hundreds of thousands of people mass migration.

</details>

**分析师**: 根据美国政府的说法，欧洲面临着文明消失的真实而严峻的前景。美国领导人，如 **Marco Rubio** 和 **JD Vance**，给出的主要原因是相当明确的。所以你看，欧洲面临的最大威胁是，西方领导人已经决定应该将数百万未经审查的外国移民涌入他们的国家。这是对欧洲最大的威胁。我们向**空前的大规模移民潮**敞开了大门，这威胁着我们社会的凝聚力，我们文化的延续性。这当然指的是2015年和2016年的那波**大规模移民潮**，当时德国的 **Angela Merkel** 曾名言道：“我们能做到。” 的确是善意的举动。但现在十年过去了，**Merkel** 是不是太天真了？根据 **Trump** 去年在联合国的说法，这些移民，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> According to the American government, Europe faces the real and stark prospect of civilizational eras. The main reason American leaders like Marco Rubio and JD Vance are quite clear. So look, the the greatest threat in Europe is that you've had the leaders of the West decide that they should send millions and millions of unvetted foreign migrants into their countries. That is the biggest threat to Europe. We opened our doors to an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture. This of course refers to the wave of mass migration in 2015 and 2016 when Germany's Angla Merkel famously said, "We're shuffandas. We can do it." An act of kindness indeed. But now 10 years later, was Merkel too naive? According to Trump at the United Nations last year, these immigrants,

</details>

**分析师**: >> 他们用犯罪回报了善意。甚至在

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> they repaid kindness with crime. Even in

</details>

**分析师**: >> 在美丽的**瑞士**，72%的囚犯来自瑞士以外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> and in Switzerland, beautiful Switzerland, 72% of the people in prisons are from outside of Switzerland.

</details>

**分析师**: **Elon Musk** 本人也将欧洲移民描述为“入侵”，并同意德国 **AFD** 党 **Dr. Ellis Vital** 的观点，即

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> Elon Musk himself has described European immigration as an invasion and agreed with Dr. Ellis Vital from Germany's AFD party that

</details>

**分析师**: >> 他们放了数百万的人进来。他们允许他们在我们的街道上犯罪，比如**犯罪率**正在飙升。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> they let like millions of people in. They let um um do let them do crimes on our streets like the crime rate are skyrocketing.

</details>

### 数据与论调

**分析师**: 但这真的属实吗？欧洲是否因此变得不安全了，这主要是由于来自欧洲以外的大规模移民？这是一个极具争议性的话题，对于那些只想了解实际情况的人来说，很难找到一个**无偏见的分析**。**右翼政客**甚至指责**学者**在此问题上存在**左翼偏见**。因此，我们花了数周时间阅读了数百项研究，试图找出是右翼政客在挑选数据，还是学者和活动家在遗漏有利的事实。在这个过程中，我们采访了博洛尼亚大学的教授 **Paulo Pinati**，他职业生涯的大部分时间都在从**数据驱动**的角度分析这个问题，并且不怕指出问题，比如

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> But is it really true? Has Europe become less safe as a result of mass migration largely from outside of Europe? This is such a politicized subject that it's incredibly difficult for people who just want to know what's actually going on to find an unbiased analysis. Right-wing politicians have even accused academics of a left-wing bias on this particular subject. Therefore, we spent weeks reading hundreds of studies trying to find out if either right-wing politicians are cherry-picking data or if academics and activists are leaving out convenient facts. In this process, we spoke to Bonei professor Paulo Pinati who has spent much of his career analyzing this issue from a datadriven perspective and is not afraid to point out problems like

</details>

**分析师**: >> 他们找不到工作，签证过期了，也许他们没钱回国，所以他们就留在了这个国家，这可以说是如果你想要一个完美的灾难配方，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> they don't get a job, the visa expires, maybe they don't have the money to go back to their own country and so they remain in the country and that's kind of if you want the perfect receipt for disaster, right?

</details>

**分析师**: 没错。在“金钱与微观”这里没有禁忌。我们只想知道发生了什么。但我们也不害怕指出夸大其词之处，比如 **AFD** 声称**犯罪率**正在飙升。自1990年代以来，欧洲的**凶杀率**有所下降，德国下降了36%，西班牙下降了50%，法国下降了15%，英国下降了4%，意大利更是惊人地下降了82%。而更令人震惊的是，这种致命暴力事件的下降恰恰发生在欧洲经历**前所未有的大规模移民潮**的同一时期，数百万移民来自东欧、非洲和中东。但如果这是真的，那为什么**移民**在欧洲监狱中的**比例如此之高**？这里有些奇怪的事情正在发生。欧洲真的面临着**文明消失**吗？欧洲的监狱里真的挤满了移民吗？有明确的证据吗？关于欧洲大规模移民经历的真相就在这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> That's right. There are no taboos here at Money and Micro. We just want to know what's going on. But we are also not afraid to call out exaggerations such as the IFD's claim that crime rates are skyrocketing. Since the 1990s, the homicide rate in Europe went down, 36% in Germany, 50% in Spain, 15 in France, 4% in the UK, and an astonishing 82% in Italy. And what makes this even more strikingly is that this decline in deadly violence happened during the same period Europe experienced unprecedented migration with millions arriving from Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. But if that is true, then why are immigrants so over represented in European prisons? Something strange is going on here. Is Europe genuinely facing civilizational erasure? And are European prisons full of immigrants? Clear evidence of that? Here is the truth about Europe's mass migration experience.

</details>

### 欧洲五次移民潮

**分析师**: 好的，要真正理解移民对欧洲产生的影响，我们需要回到过去。欧洲基本上经历了五次大的移民潮。第一次浪潮是所谓的“**客工潮**”，这是由西欧快速增长的经济对劳动力的需求所驱动的。起初，移民来自意大利、西班牙和希腊。然后，当这些经济体自身开始快速增长时，西欧开始吸引来自土耳其、摩洛哥和南斯拉夫的低技能工人。这个计划在1970年代的石油危机后停止了，当时许多工作消失了。但许多客工留了下来，而且之后，移民仍在继续，因为客工们把家人带到了欧洲。第二次浪潮与1950年代至1980年代的**非殖民化**有关。在这股浪潮中，许多来自新独立殖民地的难民迁移到了他们前殖民宗主国。这次浪潮之所以成为可能，是因为在此期间，许多殖民地居民在技术上是本国国民。而且由于他们通常已经会说当地语言，所以迁移相对容易。这就是为什么今天荷兰仍有许多印度尼西亚后裔，法国仍有许多阿尔及利亚人和非洲人，英国仍有许多印度人和巴基斯坦人。第三次，在**铁幕**落下之后，出现了一股从东欧到西欧的大规模移民潮。第四次，在2015年和2016年，出现了一股从叙利亚、北非和阿富汗到欧洲的大规模移民潮。最后，在过去几年里，数百万乌克兰人移民到了欧洲。每一次移民潮都有其自身的政治反弹。但像 **Trump** 和 **JD Vance** 这样的人，在谈论“文明消失”时，是否指的是东欧人移居西欧呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: Okay, to truly understand the impact of migration has had on Europe, we need to go back in time. Europe has essentially seen five big migration waves. The first wave was the so-called guest worker wave that was driven by the need for labor in Western Europe's fast growing economies. First, there were Italians, Spanish, and Greek migrants. And then when those economies started growing quickly themselves, Western Europe started attracting lowskilled workers from Turkey, Morocco, and Yugoslavia. This program stopped after the oil crisis of the 1970s when many jobs disappeared. But many guest workers stayed and on top of that, migration continued for a while as guest workers brought their families to Europe. The second wave was tied to decolonization from the 1950s to 1980s. And during this wave, many refugees from newly independent colonies migrated to their former colonial masters. This wave was possible because during this area, many colonial subjects were technically nationals. And since they often already spoke the language, it was relatively easy for them to move. This is why today there are still many Indonesian descendants in the Netherlands, Algerians and Africans in France, and Indians and Pakistanis in the UK. Third, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, there was a massive migration wave from East to Western Europe. And fourth, in 2015 and 2016, there was a mass migration wave from Syria, North Africa, and Afghanistan to Europe. And finally, in the last few years, millions of Ukrainians migrated to Europe. Each of these migration waves had their own political backlashes. But do people like Trump and JD Vans refer to Eastern Europeans moving to Western Europe when they talk about civilizational eraser?

</details>

### 穆斯林人口与文化冲突

**分析师**: 我认为这段来自保守派新闻频道 **Newsmax** 的剪辑清楚地表明了他们真正关心的是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: I think this clip from conservative news channel Newsmax makes it quite clear what they really care about.

</details>

**分析师**: >> 如今有5000万**穆斯林**生活在欧洲。世纪之交时，这个数字不到50万。正如领导这些国家的人们试图做 **Joe Biden** 在这里试图做的那样，那就是从根本上改变一个国家的种族和民族构成，并使**白人基督徒**成为他们自己国家中的少数，因为对西方文明的攻击仍在继续。生活在欧洲的每个人都知道，欧洲内部存在许多不同的文化。美国文化也与欧洲文化大相径庭。如果我们想看看有多么不同，那么政治科学家 **Inglehart** 和 **Welser** 就给了我们这张地图，你可以看到新教欧洲、天主教欧洲、东正教欧洲以及英语世界，这些文化是独特的，但彼此之间却相当接近。另一方面，非洲伊斯兰文化与大多数欧洲文化截然不同。你看，与文化上疏远的人共享空间会带来挑战。公立学校应该提供清真餐吗？公共机构是否应该允许佩戴**罩袍**？这些都是有效的辩论。然而，使用“文明消失”或关于白人基督徒后裔成为少数的语言的问题在于，这简直是彻头彻尾的、恕我直言的胡说八道。以 Newsmax 的节目为例。虽然5000万穆斯林听起来是个可怕的大数字，但这包括了历史上是穆斯林地区的巴尔干国家和俄罗斯共和国。更令人愤慨的是，声称世纪之交欧洲的穆斯林不到50万的说法是错误的。正如你在这里看到的，2000年，欧洲约有3700万穆斯林。而在2020年，这个数字约为4500万。为了便于理解，在此期间，欧洲穆斯林所占的比例已从占所有欧洲人的约4%缓慢上升到6%。然而，如果我们考虑到移民到欧洲仍在继续，并且穆斯林比欧洲本土居民生育的孩子更多，我们确实有一些可靠的估计，即从现在起25年，到2050年，许多西欧国家的穆斯林比例将接近或超过15%。与我们今天在许多西欧国家看到的6%到8%相比，这是一个相当大的增长。但再次强调，为了让我们的美国观众理解这些数字，今天美国黑人人口约占15%。说欧洲因穆斯林移民而面临文明消失，就像说今天的美国是一个以非洲人为主的国家。这简直是完全的胡说八道。当然，如果你去欧洲的某些城市，或者尤其是一些欧洲的社区，感觉可能会非常不同。例如，在**布鲁塞尔**，约有28%的居民是穆斯林；或者在我同事 **Alejandro** 居住的布鲁塞尔贫困社区**Anderle**，约有30%的居民是穆斯林。因此，某些城市和社区的快速转型当然导致了那里的文化紧张。事实上，除了日益加剧的经济不平等和经济停滞之外，大量研究令人信服地表明，来自非欧洲国家的低技能移民增加是解释**欧洲** **右翼政党**崛起的一个关键因素。与 Vance 和 Trump 一样，匈牙利的 **Victor Orban** 等欧洲右翼政客经常告诉我们，如果你将大量来自中东的未注册移民带入你的国家，你就是在引进**恐怖主义**、**犯罪**、**反犹主义**和**恐同主义**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> 50 million Muslims now live in Europe. At the turn of the century, that number was less than 500,000. as the people who lead these countries try to do what Joe Biden tried to do here and that is fundamentally change the racial and ethnic makeup of a nation and make white Christians a minority in their own country as the attack on western civilization continues. Everyone who lives in Europe knows that there are many different cultures inside Europe. American culture is also quite different from European culture. If we want to see how different then political scientists Inglehart and Welser have given us this map where you can see Protestant Europe, Catholic Europe, Orthodox Europe and the English-speaking world these cultures are distinct but quite close to each other. On the other hand, African Islamic cultures are very different from most European cultures. And look, sharing spaces with people who are culturally distant presents challenges. Should public schools have halal meals? Should burkas be allowed in public institutions? These are valid debates to have. However, the problem with using language like civilizational erasure or about white Christian descendants becoming a minority is that this is just complete and utter excuse my language bull. Take the newsmax segment. While 50 million Muslims sounds like a scary big number, this includes Balcon countries and Russian republics that have historically been Muslim. More outrageously, the claim that there were less than 500,000 Muslims in Europe at the turn of the century is just wrong. As you can see here, in the year 2000, there were about 37 million Muslims in Europe. And in 2020, that was about 45 million. To put that into perspective, in this period, the share of Muslims in Europe has been rising slowly from about 4% of all Europeans to 6%. However, if we take into account that migration to Europe is still happening and that Muslims tend to have more children than native Europeans, we do have some credible estimates that in 25 years from now, in 2050, the share of Muslims in many Western European countries will get close to or above 15%. That is quite a big increase from the 6 to 8% that we are seeing in many Western European countries today. But again, just to put these numbers into perspective for our American viewers, the number of black people in America today is about 15%. Saying that Europe faces civilizational erasure due to Muslim migration is like saying that America today is a dominantly African country. It is just complete and utter nonsense. But of course, if you go to certain cities in Europe or especially certain neighborhoods in Europe, it can feel very different. For example, in Brussels about 28% of inhabitants are Muslim or in the poor Brussels neighborhood of Anderle where my colleague Alejandro lives about 30% of inhabitants are Muslims. So of course the rapid transformation of certain cities and neighborhoods has led to cultural tensions there. In fact, besides increased economic inequality and economic stagnation, there's a lot of research that convincingly shows that increased low-skilled migration from non-European countries is a crucial factor needed to explain the rise of far-right parties in Europe. And much like Vines and Trump, farright European politicians like Hungary's Victor Orbin often tell us that if you take masses of non-registered immigrants from the Middle East into your country, you are importing terrorism, crime, anti-semitism, and homophobia.

### 犯罪率与移民真相

**分析师**: 那么，尽管移民及其后代仍然是欧洲的少数，但移民是否真的让欧洲变得不那么安全了呢？这就要回到 **Trump** 的联合国演讲了。在美丽的**瑞士**，72%的囚犯来自瑞士以外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: So even though migrants and their descendants remain a minority in Europe, could it still be true that immigrants are making Europe far less safe? This is where we get back to Trump's UN speech. And in Switzerland, beautiful Switzerland, 72% of the people in prisons are from outside of Switzerland.

</details>

**分析师**: >> 首先，Trump 并没有说错。移民在欧洲监狱中的比例确实过高。但正如你所见，瑞士是一个极端案例。这次演讲中，Trump 没有提到，在一些引人注目的案例中，比如英国，移民在监狱中的比例实际上是偏低的，就像在澳大利亚、新西兰和美国等其他**盎格鲁-撒克逊国家**一样。那么，这是怎么回事呢？首先，正如你所见，盎格鲁-撒克逊国家倾向于吸引受教育程度更高的移民。他们更有可能找到高薪工作，因此不太可能犯罪而入狱。欧洲大陆监狱中移民比例较高的事实，可能是因为欧洲的移民比普通欧洲人更贫穷。这并不一定与他们的文化背景有关。第二个有力的解释是，欧洲人普遍年龄较大，而移民平均年龄要年轻得多。年轻人更容易犯罪。所以，这再次可能反驳了移民类型很重要这一说法。最后，被判入狱的比例更高可能是因为移民犯了更多的罪。但也有可靠的研究表明，移民在等待审判期间被拘留的可能性更大，因为法官通常认为他们比当地人更有**潜逃风险**，这似乎有道理。但这确实使他们在协商交易时处于更不利的境地，尤其是在他们不流利使用欧洲语言的情况下。话虽如此，没有人能确切知道这三个因素的影响有多大。所以，所有这些研究既不能证明移民是无辜的，也不能证明他们犯了更多的罪。但是，好吧，这意味着 Trump 和 Orban 仍然可能是对的。移民可能会让欧洲变得不那么安全。我们只需要更多的证据。那么 **AFD** 声称的

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> First, Trump is not wrong. Immigrants are over represented in European prisons. But as you can see here, Switzerland is an extreme case. In this speech, Trump does not mention that in some striking cases, like in the case of the UK, immigrants are actually under represented in prison, just as they are in other Anglo-Saxon countries like Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. So, what's going on? First, as you can see here, Anglo-Saxon countries tend to attract much more highly educated migrants. these are more likely to find a high-paying job and therefore less likely to commit crimes and end up in jail. The fact that continental European prisons have a lot of immigrants is probably because Europe's immigrants are simply poorer than the average European. It does not necessarily have anything to do with their cultural background. A second powerful explanation is that Europeans are pretty old and immigrants are on average much younger. younger people commit more crimes. So again, this could disprove the narrative that the type of immigration matters. Finally, being in jail more could be because immigrants commit more crimes. But there's also credible research which shows that immigrants are more likely to be held in jail while waiting for the trial because judges often believe they are a higher flight risk than locals, which makes sense, I guess. but that does put them in a worse situation for negotiating deals, especially if they're not fluent in a European language. That being said, nobody knows for sure how big these three effects are. So, all of this research neither proves that immigrants are innocent, but it also does not prove that they are guilty of committing more crimes. But, okay, that means that Trump and Orban could still be right. Migrants could make Europe much less safe. We just need more evidence. So what about the AFD claim that

</details>

**分析师**: >> 犯罪率正在飙升

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> the crime rate are skyrocketing

</details>

**分析师**: >> 是因为移民？嗯，在欧洲大部分地区，我们实际上看到了相反的情况。犯罪率正在下降。例如，正如你所见，像**谋杀**这样的**暴力犯罪**在欧洲移民数量增加的同时仍在持续下降。同样，像**抢劫**、**入室盗窃**和**盗窃**等**轻微犯罪**在移民增加的同一年份在欧洲也有所下降。在德国也是如此。然而，在这里，我们确实看到在2015年大规模移民潮之后，犯罪率出现了可疑的增长。至关重要的是，这些研究并没有区分移民的背景。所以，也许 AFD 关于由于2015-2016年大规模穆斯林移民潮导致德国犯罪率上升的说法是正确的。而且，也许对于欧洲其他地区来说，如果没有所有这些新移民，犯罪率本可以下降得更快。为了将移民的影响与那些正在整体降低犯罪率的更广泛因素区分开来，比如欧洲人年龄增长以及更好的家庭和商店安全系统。研究人员已经对美国、意大利和德国的犯罪与移民之间的关系进行了几项详细研究。他们考虑了许多不同的因素，如 GDP 和青年人口。令人惊讶的是

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> because of immigrants? Well, in most of Europe, we actually see the opposite. Crime is falling. For example, as you can see here, violent crimes like murders kept on dropping even as the number of migrants in Europe increased. Similarly, petty crime like robbery, burglaries, and theft have dropped in Europe in the same years that immigration increased. This is also true in Germany. However, here we do see a suspicious increase in crime after the massive 2015 migration wave. Crucially, these studies do not distinguish between the background of migrants though. So perhaps the AFD is right about increasing crime because of the massive 2015 2016 Muslim migration wave in Germany. And perhaps even for the rest of Europe, crime could have fallen even faster if it wasn't for all these new immigrants. to separate the effect of migrants from broader effects that are decreasing crime overall, like Europeans getting older and better home and store security systems. Researchers have done several detailed studies about the relationship between crime and migration in the US, Italy, and Germany. They take into account a lot of different factors such as GDP and youth. And surprisingly

</details>

**分析师**: >> 总的来说，结论是，这些移民增加，有时是巨大的移民增加，对犯罪率没有显著影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> in general the the conclusion is that these increases in migration sometimes very huge increase in migration, they have no significant effect on crime rates.

</details>

**分析师**: >> 例如，正如你所见，虽然大多数移民在2008年至2019年间来到东德，但犯罪率在德国西部和南部大部分地区有所上升。但如果移民并没有明显增加整体犯罪率，即使是在德国和意大利这样的地方，低技能移民怎么会在监狱中比例如此之高呢？当我们问到 **Pinati** 教授时，他提出了另一种解释。移民可能正在取代某些类型犯罪活动中的本土罪犯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> For example, as you can see here while most migrants came to East Germany between 2008 and 2019, crime has mostly gone up in the west and south of Germany. But if migrants do not clearly increase overall crime even in places like Germany and Italy, how can low-skilled migrants be so over represented in prisons? When we asked Professor Pinati about this, he offered another explanation. Immigrants may be replacing nativeborn offenders in some types of criminal activity.

</details>

**分析师**: >> 所以想想**毒品**行业，**贩毒**，这在大多数情况下是一项主要的犯罪活动，对吧？所以，如果你20年前想买毒品，毒贩很可能是一个本地人，对吧？嗯，如果你现在买毒品，毒贩将是一个外国犯罪团伙的成员，对吧？但最终，街上销售的毒品数量仍然是相同的。它更多地取决于其他因素，更多地取决于对毒品的需求。换句话说，老实说，这绝对是我在开始为这个视频做研究时没有想到的。**移民可能确实比本地人犯更多的罪**。但他们并没有增加整体犯罪率。就像移民可能会从欧洲本地人那里抢走低技能工作，比如摘水果一样，他们也可能实际上只是从欧洲本地人那里抢走了“犯罪工作”。所以，例如，我们在涉及贩毒的这些非常大的犯罪网络中观察到的是，本地人仍然是网络的一部分，但他们爬升到组织的高层，而低层，比如街头的零售商，街头的毒贩，将是与20年前不同的移民。不过，我必须诚实地说，我们没有足够的数据来完全、毫无疑问地证实这就是发生的事情。但这可以解释为什么即使在详细的研究中，大规模移民潮似乎也没有导致更多犯罪，但它们可能导致被监禁的移民数量增加。所以，好吧，你看，证据实际上相当清楚。结论。即使是极其详细的最新研究，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> So think about the drug sector, drug trafficking, which is a major criminal enterprise in most cases, right? So if you were trying to buy drugs 20 years ago, the dealer probably was going to be a native, right? Um if you buy drugs nowadays, uh the dealer is going to be a member of some foreign criminal group, right? But in the end, the amount of drugs that is sold in the street is still going to be the same. It depends more on other it depends more on the demand for drugs. In other words, and honestly, this is something I absolutely did not expect when starting the research for this video, it is possible that yes, immigrants commit more crimes than native people. And yet, they do not increase crime overall. Just like immigrants may take low-skilled jobs like fruit picking from native Europeans, they may actually also simply take crime jobs from native Europeans as well. So for instance, what we observe in these very large criminal uh networks involving drug trafficking is that the natives they are still part of the networks but they climb up to the higher levels of the organization while the lower level like the retail seller in the street the drug dealer in the street is going to be an immigrant different from 20 years ago. Still, I have to be honest. We don't have enough data to completely, without a doubt, confirm that this is what happened. But it could explain why even in detailed studies, big migration waves do not seem to lead to more crime, but they could lead to a higher number of criminals in jail that are immigrants. So, okay, there you have it. The evidence is actually pretty clear. Conclusion. Even for extremely detailed recent studies,

</details>

**分析师**: >> 结论是，这些移民增加，有时是巨大的移民增加，对犯罪率没有显著影响。所以，欧洲没有面临**文明消失**的风险。而且近期的移民潮也没有导致犯罪率飙升。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Analyst**: >> the conclusion is that these increases in migration, sometimes very huge increase in migration, they have no significant effect on crime rates. So no, Europe is not at risk of civilizational erasure. And even recent migration waves have not caused crime to skyrocket.

### 移民融入与社会挑战

**分析师**: 没错。我，一个象牙塔里的前学者，告诉普通人：“大家散了吧，没什么好看的。研究表明移民没问题，你们应该敞开边境，让移民进来。” 如果这让你感到不安全或不安，那你就是错了。不，仅仅因为真相不在一个极端，并不意味着真相就在另一个极端。来自不同文化的移民总是会引起**紧张关系**。但一个常常被忽视的关键因素是**就业机会**。如果寻求庇护者和移民不被允许合法工作，他们可能会陷入困境。他们的签证可能会过期。他们可能没有钱回国。而且没有合法的就业机会，是的，有些人可能会转向非法赚钱的方式，比如贩毒或盗窃。**Professor Pinati** 的研究表明，当移民获得**合法身份**，最终能够获得合法身份并因此获得在官方经济中工作的权利时，犯罪的可能性会**下降50%**。减半了，对吧？所以，关键信息是，如果你确实想要一些移民，那么有秩序地进行移民至关重要。这也可以解释为什么一项近期研究发现，在相对混乱的2015-16年移民潮一年后，德国的**入室盗窃**和**盗窃**确实显著增加。所以 **AFD** 政客们对 **Elon Musk** 所说的话，确实有些道理。另一件事是，你想确保移民及其子女能够融入社会，而不是都最终陷入一些孤立的**贫民区**，比如法国的 ban 区域，或者布鲁塞尔的 **Ander** 等郊区。除此之外，我们今天讨论的研究的一个主要局限性是，它关注的是移民本身，而不是他们的子女。近期研究表明，在奥地利、荷兰、法国和丹麦等国家，来自前两次移民潮的移民子女在生活中向上发展的机会，往往比在同等贫困水平下长大的本土父母的子女要困难。这可能有助于解释为什么例如在丹麦，**第二代移民**比他们的父母（一方面是移民）和本土丹麦儿童更有可能入狱。最后，我们应该对一种可能性持开放态度，即来自对女性持有更传统态度的国家的男性，平均而言，更有可能从事**性暴力**。这不应该完全令人惊讶，因为我们知道持有性别歧视态度的男性更有可能对女性实施暴力。令人担忧的是，**隆德大学**的一项近期研究发现，在瑞典被判犯有**强奸罪**的人中，有63%有移民背景。在控制了社会经济因素以及物质滥用和精神健康状况后，这种大规模的过高代表性有所下降，但并未完全消失。所以，是的，即使移民并没有明显地让欧洲整体上变得不安全，但仍然存在需要研究并且更重要的是需要解决的真实而严重的问题。然而，这些问题显然不足以让 **Donald Trump** 感到担忧。谈到性犯罪者，也许他应该更多地担心他的政府正在积极保护一名被定罪的恋童癖者的同伙，并且 **Trump** 和他的朋友们在**爱泼斯坦文件**中出现的频率很高。也许称之为“文明消失”有点过了，但这确实很像欧洲的“**文明衰落**”。但是的，这就是我的看法。你怎么看？如果你正在寻找更多这类诚实的数据驱动的讨论，我强烈建议你继续收听我们的广告赞助商《**经济学人**》。具体来说，看看这篇关于欧洲**非法移民**惊人下降的故事。然后，再阅读这篇关于连民粹主义者都喜欢的移民计划的文章。最后，阅读这篇关于为什么 **Trump** 的零移民政策会让美国更贫穷、更缺乏创新能力的分析。正如这些文章所示，《经济学人》提供了深刻的见解，让你能够看到大局并独立思考。这就是为什么我在制作这些视频时经常将它们作为信息来源，也是为什么我强烈建议你订阅《经济学人》。我很高兴地宣布，《经济学人》已同意为 Money Macro 的观众提供特别的35%折扣。无论你是想在《经济学人》应用程序上阅读每日新闻，还是像我一样，喜欢在周末一边喝咖啡一边阅读纸质版来了解全球经济，你都将始终掌握最新的全球发展动态，并向他人表明你关心事实信息以及诚信和责任的价值观。所以，不要错过。点击下方描述或置顶评论中的链接，或者前往 economist.com/moneymackro 领取你独家的35%折扣。

**Analyst**: That's right. Here I am, an ex-academic in his ivory tower telling ordinary people, "Move along, folks. There's nothing to see here. Research says immigration is fine. You should just open your borders and let the immigrants come." If that is making you feel unsafe or uneasy, well, you are wrong. No. Just because the truth is not on one extreme does not mean that the truth is on the other extreme. Immigrants from distant cultures always cause tensions. But one key factor that often gets overlooked is access to jobs. If asylum seekers and migrants are not allowed to work legally, they can end up stuck. Their visa might expire. They might not have money to return home. And without access to regular jobs, yeah, some may turn to illegal ways of making money like drug dealing or burglary. The work that professor pinati has shown that when immigrants uh receive legal status, they are finally able to obtain legal status and therefore the right to work in the official economy, the probability of committing crimes decreases by 50%. It's cut by half. Right? So the takeaway should be that if you do want to have some migration, it's essential to do it orderly. This can also explain that a recent study did find that one year after the relatively chaotic 2015-16 migration wave, there was actually a significant wave of increased burglaries and theft in Germany. So there was some truth to what the AFD politicians said to Elon Musk. Another thing is that you want to make sure that migrants and their children are able to integrate into society and that they do not all end up in some isolated ghettos such as the French ban or in Brussels suburbs like Ander. On top of that, one major limitation of the research that we've discussed today is that it looks at migrants but not at their children. Recent research shows that in countries like Austria, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark, children of immigrants from the first two waves often have a harder time moving up in life compared to children of native parents who grew up with the same level of poverty. This may actually help explain why second generation immigrants in, for example, Denmark are actually more likely to end up in prison than both their parents, on the one hand, migrants, and native Danish children. Finally, we should be open to the possibility that men from countries with more traditional attitudes toward women are on average more likely to engage in sexual violence. This should not be entirely surprising since we know that men with sexist attitudes are more likely to commit violence against women. Worryingly, a recent study from Lund University found that 63% of those convicted of rape in Sweden have an immigration background. This massive over representation decreased a bit after controlling for soio economic factors and for substance abuse and mental health conditions, but it did not disappear completely. So yeah, even if migration has not clearly made Europe less safe overall, there are still real serious problems that need to be studied and more importantly fixed. However, these problems are clearly not big enough that it is something that Donald Trump should be worried about. Talking about sex offenders, perhaps he should worry a bit more about the fact that his government is actively protecting the associates of a convicted pedophile and that Trump and his friends are over represented in the Epstein files. Maybe it's a bit much to call that civilizational erasure, but it does look a lot like civilizational decline all the way from here in Europe. But yeah, that's my take. What do you think?
