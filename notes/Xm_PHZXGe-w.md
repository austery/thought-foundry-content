### 孕期饮食与DNA编程

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 通过孕期的饮食，你正在**编程**宝宝的 **DNA**。这将对宝宝的发育以及未来患病的风险产生深远影响。现在有很多孕妇的饮食并没有提供宝宝所需的营养。这并不是妈妈的错，而是我们的**食品体系**和社会的错。没有人告诉妈妈们这些。我想创建这个指南来帮助父母应对这个食品体系，看看他们可以做哪些简单的事情来帮助宝宝发育。

我知道这些是因为作为一名**生物化学家**，当我怀孕时，我深入研究了相关资料。我学到了一些核心内容。例如，90% 的妈妈在孕期没有摄入足够的**胆碱 (Choline)**。胆碱非常重要，它在子宫里构建宝宝的大脑。这是我怀孕 9 个月里每周吃的鸡蛋数量，因为这是给宝宝提供充足胆碱最简单的方法。此外，宝宝在孕期不需要**果糖 (Fructose)**。来自甜点、巧克力、松饼或纸杯蛋糕的糖，宝宝完全不需要。因为如果你在孕期血糖水平非常高，科学家发现宝宝的 DNA 会产生**表观遗传 (Epigenetic)** 开关，编程让他们更容易患上糖尿病、肥胖症和精神疾病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: With your diet during pregnancy, you're programming your baby's DNA. And this is going to have an impact on your baby's development and on their future risk of disease. And there's a lot of pregnant moms who are eating a diet that's not giving them the nutrients their baby needs. This is not the mom's fault. This is the fault of our food system. This is the fault of society. And nobody's telling moms about this. And I wanted to create this guide to help parents navigate that food system and see easy things they can do to help their baby's development. And I know this because as a biochemist when I became pregnant, I just went deep, deep, deep into the research. And there are some main things that I learned. For example, 90% of moms are not getting enough choline during pregnancy. And choline is super important. It forms your baby's brain in the womb. So this is the amount of eggs that I ate per week during the 9 months of pregnancy because this is the simplest way to give enough choline to our baby. And then your baby needs no fructose during pregnancy. So sugar from dessert, from chocolate, from muffins, from cupcakes, your baby needs none of this. Because if you have very high glucose levels during pregnancy, scientists have found that your baby's DNA will have epigenetic switches that are programming them towards having a higher vulnerability to develop diabetes, obesity, and psychiatric disorders.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 接下来，这基本上是我在怀孕最后三个月每天需要摄入的**蛋白质**量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Next, this is basically the amount of protein that I needed to eat every single day in the third trimester of pregnancy.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 因为研究显示，低蛋白饮食会导致宝宝体型较小，并可能产生这种让他们一生都保持较小体型的表观遗传编程。正是这些发现促使我为孕妇制定了一个计划和简单的技巧，我们可以聊聊这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: because the studies show low protein diets lead to smaller babies and potentially this epigenetic programming of staying smaller throughout life. And it's findings like that that led me to create a plan and simple hacks for pregnant moms and we can talk about them.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 那么，研究对于母乳喂养、运动、咖啡因是怎么说的？另外，你是否建议母亲服用某些补充剂？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: And then what does the research say about breastfeeding, exercise, caffeine, and also do you recommend that mothers take certain supplements?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 这就是人们需要知道的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: So this is what people need to know.

</details>

### 血糖与情绪的奇妙联系

**Stephen Bartlett**: **Jessie Inchauspé**，也就是“**葡萄糖女神 (Glucose Goddess)**”，对于那些还不认识你的人，你在过去十年的大部分时间里致力于研究什么，为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: Jessie Inospay, the glucose goddess, for people that don't know who you are, what have you spent the best part of the last decade committing your life to and why?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 我的工作始于**血糖 (Blood Sugar)** 领域。我向人们展示血糖如何每天影响我们所有人。进食后的血糖激增和下降会导致炎症、加速衰老、渴望食物和疲劳。这是我工作的基础，因为血糖对每个人都很重要，它是身心健康的核心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: My work started in the glucose space, meaning the blood sugar space. I was showing people how blood sugar impacts all of us on a daily basis. The spikes and dips after we eat, they lead to inflammation, faster aging, cravings, fatigue, and it's been the basis of my work because glucose matters for everybody and it is the core of a healthy body and mind. And so that's where I started because it's so important.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 我们上次谈话大约是两年前。在这两年里，你学到了什么让你进化或发展了你的想法？如果回顾我们关于血糖激增、糖、健康后果和饮食的谈话，这两年里有没有什么有趣的新发现？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: We last spoke almost two years ago now. What have you learned in those last two years that has evolved your own thinking or has developed your own thinking in any way? If we reflect on the last conversations we had around glucose spikes and sugar and the health consequences and diets, is there anything you've learned in those two years that is interesting and new?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 噢，绝对有。我认为主要是血糖对**情绪**和**人际关系**的影响。例如，有一项非常迷人的研究，研究对象是已婚夫妇。研究人员给丈夫和妻子每人一个代表配偶的**巫毒娃娃**，并告诉参与者，每当配偶让他们生气时，就在娃娃身上插一根针。两周结束时，研究人员统计了针的数量，并测量了参与者的血糖水平。他们发现，血糖波动最剧烈（低血糖次数最多）的人，在代表配偶的娃娃身上插的针也最多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Oh, absolutely. I think mostly the impact of glucose on mood and on relationships. For example, there's this fascinating study that took married couples and they gave the husband and the wives a little voodoo doll representing their spouse. And the researchers told the participants to put a little pin in the voodoo doll every time their spouse annoyed them. At the end of the two weeks, the researchers counted the number of pins in the voodoo dolls and they also measured the participants glucose levels. They found that the people who had the most glucose lows had put the most pins in the voodoo doll representing their spouse.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: Wow.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 这只是一个关联性研究，但很有趣。科学家随后发现，当你的血糖水平非常不稳定时，会影响大脑中一种叫做**酪氨酸 (Tyrosine)** 的神经递质，它负责管理你的情绪。所以，血糖不稳定时，你的情绪也较不稳，这可能导致你更容易对配偶感到恼火。我认为这类研究真的让我大开眼界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: So, it's just an association, but it's interesting. And scientists then found that when you have very unsteady glucose levels, it impacts this neurotransmitter in your brain called tyrrosine that manages your mood. So, it seems that with unsteady glucose levels, your mood is less stable, which could then correlate to you be more annoyed at your spouse. So, I think studies like this have really blown my mind.

</details>

### 血糖崩溃与意志力危机

**Stephen Bartlett**: 当我们经历所谓的“**血糖崩溃 (Glucose Crash)**”时，身体发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: What's going on when we go through a glucose crash, per se?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 血糖是你身体的能量。你的大脑不断监测血液中有多少葡萄糖。稳定的血糖是极好的。当血糖水平崩溃时，这在生物学上意味着你“没油了”。这是一个强烈的信号，告诉你的身体和大脑：“警报，警报，我们需要食物，我们需要更多葡萄糖。”这会产生一系列后果：你会变得“**饿怒 (Hangry)**”，满脑子都是食物，心情变差。你会想吃香蕉、饼干，它还会激活大脑中的渴望中心，让你去找巧克力。

有趣的是，在采集狩猎时代，我们的血糖水平不会下降得这么快，因为那时没有导致剧烈下降的巨大峰值。那时我们的饮食更均衡，糖分更少。今天，因为我们可以轻易获得大量的糖，血糖会迅速飙升，结果就是迅速崩溃。这种影响几乎是即时的且非常强烈。我们已经把血糖调节紊乱到了一个影响极其不自然的地步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: So, glucose is your body's energy. So, your brain is constantly monitoring how much glucose do we have in our bloodstream. And steady glucose is great. When your glucose levels crash, this indicates biologically that you're out of fuel. And this is a powerful signal to your body and your brain to say, \"Alert, alert. We need food. We need more glucose.\" And so it creates all these downstream consequences on your mood. You become hangry. All you think about is food. You're in a bad mood. You're like, \"I need to eat something.\" You look for a banana. You look for a cookie. It can also activate the craving center in your brain that says, \"Steven, go find some chocolate.\" And science has shown this. Low glucose levels creates a cascade of consequences on how we feel and what we seek. Now, what's interesting is that back in the day when we had low glucose levels, I'm talking like hunter gatherer times, they wouldn't arrive so quickly because we didn't have these big spikes that then led to these big drastic drops. It was more we ate in a more balanced way with less sugar obviously. So, when our glucose became low, it was a bit more gradual. Today, because we have access to all this sugar, we can spike our glucose very quickly and as a result, it then crashes very quickly. So, the effects are pretty much immediate and they're very intense. All of a sudden, you go from feeling okay to your brain being in alert mode. We need to find more fuel. So, we've disregulated our glucose levels to the point where it's impacting us in a very unnatural way.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 这部分是因为我们改造了食物吗？甚至是水果。我看过水果的历史，苹果、香蕉等在被改造成更甜、更多汁之前，看起来完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: Is that in part because we modify our food? Even fruit. When I looked back through the history of fruit, apples, bananas, etc. looked extremely different before they were modified to be juicier and sweeter, etc.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 完全正确。这就像狗一样，所有的品种都源自狼。人类非常擅长通过育种来让自然事物服务于自己的目的。对于水果也是如此。祖先香蕉很小，充满纤维和种子，并不甜。而现代香蕉充满了糖，纤维含量低，非常容易食用。

所以人们需要了解的第一件事是：**水果并不完全是天然的**，它是人类工程的产物。然而，一整块完整的水果含有纤维和水分，这能减缓糖分进入血液的速度。问题在于当我们破坏了水果的结构，例如把橙子榨成**橙汁**。你丢弃了纤维，剩下的只是高糖水果的糖分和水。结果是你摄入了极不自然的糖分，没有纤维保护，导致血糖剧烈飙升。人们常说橙汁比可口可乐好，因为有维生素，这其实是一个**神话**。一杯橙汁和一罐可乐的含糖量相同（约 25 克），你的身体吸收它们的方式完全一样。我希望橙汁能从学校午餐和医院餐食中消失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Completely. It's like dogs. So all the the dog breeds today from Chihuahua to golden retrievers, they all come from wolves. Humans have been breeding wolves together to create these different species of dogs. They all have that ancestor of the grey wolf. So humans are very good at breeding natural things to serve their purposes. And when it comes to fruit, it's the same thing. So as you say, if you compare like an ancestral banana or an ancestral apple to a modern one, they look completely different. And you should pull up these photos. They're fascinating. Ancestral banana, tiny, full of fiber, full of seeds, not very sweet. And then modern banana, full of sugar, low in fiber, really easy to eat. So that's the first thing people need to know about fruit. Fruit is not natural. Fruit is the product of human engineering. However, a piece of whole fruit also contains fiber and water. So even though it's been bred to have a lot of sugar, the fiber in the water reduce how quickly the sugar arrives in our bloodstream, making it more or less okay for us. But the problem comes when we denature that piece of fruit. Meaning if we remove the fiber, for example, if we take an orange and make an orange juice, what are we actually talking about here? Actually, oranges are not even a natural fruit. They were invented thousands of years ago by breeding by crossing other species of fruit. To make an orange juice, you throw away part of the orange. You throw away the solid part, which is the fiber. So, you're left with the sugar of a very sugary fruit, water, and no fiber. As a result, you're getting a very unnatural amount of sugar in your bloodstream with no fiber to protect the spike. So, a big big glucose spike. And people often say, \"Oh, well, you know, fruit has vitamins in it, so therefore orange juice must be better for you than Coca-Cola.\" That's actually a total myth. If you compare a glass of orange juice to a glass of Coca-Cola, it's the same amount of sugar, about 25 grams. and the sugar in the can of Coke and the sugar in the glass of orange juice, they're exactly the same. They're glucose and fructose molecules, and your body absorbs them in the exact same way. Your body does not make a difference between sugar from an orange and sugar from a sugar beat that's now in a can of Coca-Cola. I I hope that orange juice disappears from school lunches, from hospital meals. The World Health Organization recommends 25 gram of sugar per day or less. So, with just one glass of orange juice in the morning that you squeeze at home that you think is good for you, you're already at the maximum limit of sugar recommendation. And most people drink this glass of orange juice thinking it's good for them. Most people with diabetes drink this glass of orange juice thinking it's helping them with their condition. And that's really where I want to act. I want to help people understand what they actually need to do to feel better so they don't fall victim to marketing.

### 糖分陷阱与多巴胺上瘾

**Stephen Bartlett**: 血糖崩溃是否会导致其他强迫行为？比如让我更想在网上**刷无意义内容 (Doom Scrolling)**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: We talked there about glucose crashes and what that causes in terms of behavior. I was wondering if also causes other compulsive behaviors. Does it make me more likely to want to doom scroll on the internet if I have been eating lots of sugar?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 这是一个好问题。为什么吃糖感觉很好？因为它在大脑中释放**多巴胺 (Dopamine)**。多巴胺是快乐分子。当你刷 Instagram 时，每看到一个新奇的帖子，大脑也会发出多巴胺信号。如果你不断触发多巴胺飙升，你就会不断经历崩溃，并变得越来越上瘾。

虽然我不知道是否有直接研究将血糖激增与刷屏联系起来，但从生物学角度看，它们触发的是同一个中心。如果你处于多巴胺暴饮暴食或成瘾循环中，橙汁、血糖激增和刷屏确实是相辅相成的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Well, that's a great question. Why does sugar feel good? Because it releases dopamine in our brain. Dopamine is the pleasure molecule. It makes us feel good. So if I were to drink this glass of orange juice, which you would have to pay me a lot of money for me to drink this, but my brain would let out so many dopamine molecules and I would feel this wave of pleasure. Now the problem is people confuse that with energy. It's not energy, it's dopamine. And dopamine is the same exact molecule that gets released when you're scrolling on Instagram. You look for the next post, you look for the next video. Every time you get something new and interesting, bam, a dopamine signal as well in your brain. So, if you're constantly triggering dopamine in your brain, you're going to constantly crash. You're going to have dopamine spikes, dopamine crashes, and become more and more addicted to it. So, I don't know about studies showing glucose spikes, and for example, doom scrolling. But if you look at just the biology of it, they're triggering the same center in your brain. So, for sure, I can imagine that if you are on a dopamine binging or dopamine addiction cycle, both an orange juice and a glucose spike and doom scrolling can go hand in hand.

</details>

**Stephen Bartlett**: 我刚才查了一些研究，确实如此。在血糖崩溃期间，你更有可能去刷屏。这是因为**前额叶皮层 (Prefrontal Cortex)** 出现了“能量危机”。这部分大脑负责意志力和决策，当血糖下降时，它会首先“关灯”以节省能量供生命中枢使用。结果就是你失去了执行功能，几乎无法抵抗社交媒体带来的多巴胺诱惑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: I was just looking at some research here and it says yes, you're significantly more likely to doom scroll during a glucose crash. And it explains that that's because of something called the energy crisis in the prefrontal cortex where your prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for willpower and decision-m and saying no to things like doom scrolling in the case where glucose drops. This area is first to dim the lights to save energy for vital functions. The result is you lose your executive function, making it nearly impossible to resist the hit of dopamine that social media provides. But it also says the second reason is this dopamine trap. And the third is generally your emotional regulation goes out of the window. I I think this in part because I notice in myself that when I am on a higher glucose diet, I'm more likely to get involved in like compulsive behaviors that I otherwise don't like.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 是的，你失去了意志力和控制力，感觉更容易上瘾。当人们处于血糖过山车状态时，他们会觉得对糖上瘾。去拿那块饼干不再是一种选择，而是一种强迫行为。所以当你告诉某人“少吃点糖”时，那是废话。你必须去修复根本原因，即血糖崩溃。

这里有一个理论叫**蛋白质杠杆假说 (Protein Leverage Hypothesis)**。它认为，在摄入足够的蛋白质之前，你的身体会一直让你感到饥饿并寻找食物。如果你早餐只吃燕麦和果酱吐司，几乎没有蛋白质，你的身体会说：“没吃到蛋白质，继续找。”到上午 10 点你又饿了。如果你摄入了 40 克蛋白质，那种渴望就会消散，寻找食物的感觉就会平息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Yeah. You have less willpower, less control. You feel more addicted. And the first thing that people notice is that when they are on a glucose roller coaster, they feel addicted to sugar. like it's no longer a choice to go after that cookie, it feels like a compulsive behavior like I need sugar right now because that glucose crash is triggering a biological mechanism that is nearly impossible to override. So when you tell somebody just eat less sugar, that's that's BS. You can't just eat less sugar. You have to go fix the underlying cause, which is usually the glucose crash. You can't override that feeling of craving that comes from deep inside your brain when you have a glucose crash. You need to fix the spike, reduce the spike, and then naturally the spike also reduces and you feel fewer cravings. There's this theory called the protein leverage hypothesis. And this this theory says that your body will keep you hungry and keep you seeking food until you've given it enough protein. So if in the morning you have uh I don't know some oats and toast and jam, very little protein, your body's going to be like, \"Okay, we didn't get any protein. We need to get more protein.\" So you stay more and more hungry. At 10 a.m. you're hungry again. If you have a cookie, again, no protein. Your body will keep you hungry. If all of a sudden you have 40 grams of protein, then that craving dissipates and that feeling of seeking out food sort of calms down because your body got what he actually needed, which was protein.

### 孕期营养：不仅是一个“烤箱”

**Stephen Bartlett**: 你刚生完孩子 8 个月，这也和你写新书 **《Nine Months That Count Forever》** 有关。在你可以写的众多主题中，为什么选择这个？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephen Bartlett**: You've just given birth. Eight months ago. Yeah. Feels like just last week, but yeah, eight months ago. And um I guess that's somewhat linked to why you've written this new book, which is titled Nine Months That Count Forever: How Your Pregnancy Diet Shapes Your Baby's Future. You could have written about anything, Jesse, and people would have bought the book um because people are so fascinated by you and the work that you do. Why of all the subjects you could have written about was this the subject that meant the most to you to commit a long period of your life to?

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 因为在这个领域，科学已知的事实与父母被告知的信息之间存在巨大的鸿沟。人们常说怀孕就像“**烤箱里的面包 (Bun in the oven)**”，这个比喻非常误导。它暗示你只是一个提供热量和时间的被动容器，只要放松让自然发挥作用就好。它还暗示宝宝在受精那一刻就定型了，就像布朗尼蛋糕放进烤箱后，烤箱不会把它变成香蕉面包。

但事实并非如此。宝宝在受精时并未定型。怀孕的九个月是在**共同创造**宝宝的蓝图。根据你的饮食，出来的宝宝会完全不同。我们一直在欺骗孕妇，说她们没有主导权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Because it is a subject where there's such a big gap, Stephen, between what science knows and what parents are told. It felt like there was a just canyon between information in the studies that's been there for decades and what I as a pregnant woman went through and what advice I was given, what's available out there to pregnant moms. So even though I was pregnant and I was tired, I felt I need to write this book because people need to know the power that they have. So today, science knows that you're not just an oven when you're pregnant. Have you heard this thing being a bun in the oven? It's an American expression. Uh, I think I've heard it once or twice. Yeah. Okay. So, often if you're pregnant, people will say, \"Oh, you have a bun in the oven. That's so cute.\" It's like an expression. And I feel like this is where all of our problems started because it implies so many misleading things. It implies that when you're pregnant, you are an oven, meaning you're just there to provide heat and time. And people often say, \"Just relax, you know, let nature do its thing.\" So, it implies that you're passive, that you have no agency, no power. You're just a vessel of heat and time. That's the first problem. The second problem is that it implies that just like a chocolate cake that you put in the oven, it implies that your baby, the moment the sperm meets the egg, your baby is set in stone. Like if you're making a cake, when you make the brownie and you put it in the oven, the oven is not going to change the brownie into banana bread. The oven is just cooking the brownie. Well, actually, it's very different with pregnancy. Your baby is not set in stone at conception. What happens during the nine months of pregnancy is co-creating your baby's plan. And depending on what you eat, a different baby will come out. So, we've been lying to pregnant moms, telling them they have no agency, they have no power, they should just relax and let nature do its thing. So, that's why I wrote this book because the science is fascinating.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 虽然宝宝的 DNA 在受精那一刻就确定了，但通过孕期的饮食，你正在对这些 DNA 进行编程。你听说过**表观遗传学 (Epigenetics)** 吗？它们就像 DNA 上的“调光开关”，决定激活或关闭某个基因。如果你在孕期血糖水平很高，科学家发现宝宝的 DNA 会产生表观遗传开关，编程让他们未来更容易患上糖尿病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: So while your baby's DNA is set the moment the sperm meets the egg with your diet during pregnancy, you're programming that DNA. Have you heard of epigenetics? Okay. So epigenetics are like these little dimmer switches that sit on your DNA and that say activate this gene or silence this gene. And so during pregnancy, you're putting these little switches on your baby's DNA. And this is going to have an impact on your baby's development and on his future risk of disease. I'll give you a very simple example. If you have very high glucose levels during pregnancy, scientists have found that your baby's DNA will have epigenetic switches that are programming him towards having a higher vulnerability to develop diabetes himself in his lifetime. So if you have high glucose levels, your baby will be programmed to be more likely to then have high glucose levels himself throughout his life as a kid, a teenager, and an adult. That's epigenetic programming. And depending on your diet as the mom, you can program your kids differently. But nobody tells moms about this. And that's what I'm trying to change.

</details>

### 胆碱：大脑发育的基石

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 怀孕分为三个阶段（Trimesters）。从第二阶段（四个月）开始，**胎盘 (Placenta)** 形成，母婴血液开始交换营养。有一个流传很广的谎言是：“别担心，宝宝会从你身上摄取他需要的一切。”事实是：宝宝得不到他需要的，他只能得到你**提供**的。

以**胆碱 (Choline)** 为例，它存在于**蛋黄**中。胆碱对于在子宫内构建宝宝的大脑至关重要，它负责形成处理信息的神经元，以及与记忆、学习和注意力相关的脑区。美国儿科学会表示，如果此时未能提供胆碱，可能导致宝宝终生的大脑缺陷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: And so for the second and third trimesters, there's another organ that you create inside your uterus. It's called the placenta. And the placenta's job is to bring your baby's bloodstream and your bloodstream as the mom in really close contact. And all of a sudden, symbiosis is established. And your bloodstream and your baby's bloodstream are then going to exchange nutrients and waste. So your baby's going to get all his nutrition directly from your bloodstream. And Stephen, here's a main myth that people believe. They believe that your baby will just get what he needs from you during pregnancy. That's something moms are told. Don't worry, your baby will get what he needs from you. This is a lie. Depending on what you eat, your baby will have different access to important nutrients. So, your baby doesn't get what he needs. He gets what's there and what you give him. So, let's take a simple example. One of the nutrients that is really important is called choline. Have you heard about choline before? Is that in eggs? Yes, exactly. It's in the egg yolk. So, choline is super important. It forms your baby's brain in the womb. So, your baby your baby's brain has these cells that are forming called neurons, which are the ones that process information. And choline is important to creating those neurons. And choline creates the parts of your baby's brain that have to do with memory, learning, and attention. So that egg that you're holding contains about 125 milligs of choline and it's an incredible incredible substance. The thing is if you don't eat enough choline your baby's brain is not going to get enough choline and this can have an impact on the development of your child. So much so that the American Association of Pediatrics says failure to provide choline during this time can result in lifelong brain deficits in the baby.

</details>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 如今 90% 的妈妈在孕期胆碱摄入不足。因为没有人告诉她们，而且现代饮食中缺乏这些营养。最简单的方法就是吃鸡蛋。**每天四个鸡蛋**是黄金数字。这能提供每天约 450 毫克的胆碱。康奈尔大学的一项研究显示，摄入双倍推荐量胆碱的妈妈，其宝宝在出生第一年的反应速度快了 10%，这与成年后的 IQ 相关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Today, 90% of moms are not getting enough choline during pregnancy. 90% of moms are not getting enough choline during pregnancy. Why? Because nobody is telling them about it. And because today we don't eat very nutritious nutritious foods anymore that contain a lot of choline. They're present in eggs. So four eggs a day gives you all the choline that you need. But choline is also present in organ meats like liver. Nobody eats liver anymore. Most of the foods that we eat today, cupcakes, dried fruits, burgers, chips, they don't contain a lot of choline. We need to be eating eggs. This is the simplest way to give enough choline to our baby. And scientists do these animal studies where they deprive moms from choline. And they look at the impact on the brain. And they see that brain development in the baby stops earlier than it should. And those babies are born with fewer neurons. The amount of choline in your diet during pregnancy is going to be impacting your child's brain development. And nobody's telling moms about this. It's really messed up. So, how many eggs a day do I need to eat while I'm pregnant to get enough choline? Four is the golden number. So, here I think we have 28 eggs. So, every day during pregnancy, I ate four eggs. So, this is the amount of eggs that I ate per week during the nine months of pregnancy. That's a lot of eggs. But as I was doing this, I knew I was giving my baby all the choline that he needed, which is about 450 mg per day. And this is not very expensive. 28 eggs is about $7. So for $1 a day, you're getting all the choline that your baby needs to form his brain.

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 糖分很有趣。当你吃糖时，宝宝也会通过胎盘接收到。宝宝在孕期不需要任何果糖。英国的一项研究利用了 1940-1953 年的糖配给制度作为天然实验。结果发现，在限糖期间怀孕的妈妈，其孩子未来患 2 型糖尿病的可能性降低了 15%。

**Jessie Inchauspé**: So, sugar is fascinating. When you eat sugar, your baby is also receiving that sugar because that placenta lets the sugar through. And your baby doesn't need any sugar during pregnancy. He needs a little bit of glucose, which is different. But sugar, as in the very sweet molecule of fructose that is in chocolate, that is in these cupcakes, that is in dried fruit, your baby needs none of it. And the most interesting study on sugar in pregnancy actually came from the UK. So from 1940 to 1953, I don't know if you know this, but in the UK, there was a governmentmandated sugar ration, meaning for 13 years, the government controlled how much sugar people had access to. It was during the war and they were trying to manage resources. So everybody in the UK got 10 sugar cubes per day. That's it. And this is down from what people usually ate before the sugar ration, which was about 20 sugar cubes per day. So everybody, including pregnant moms, for 13 years had a capped amount of sugar. At the end of the sugar ration, after 13 years, bam, everybody went back up to eating more sugar. And so scientists in the early 2000s thought, well, that's really interesting. This means we have two groups of pregnant moms during the sugar ration and right after the sugar ration who had babies develop in their womb either with 40 grams of sugar per day or around 80 grams of sugar per day. And the scientists wondered, can this small difference be making an impact on the baby's long-term health? So, they called up 60,000 people who were born either just before the ration ended or just after and they asked them about their health. They were like, \"Do you have diabetes? Do you have heart disease? How are you feeling? What's your weight? And they saw that the babies who were born and who were in the mother's womb during the sugar ration had 15% lower likelihood of having developed type 2 diabetes in their lifetime.

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 此外，高血糖还会导致炎症。宝宝大脑中的**小胶质细胞 (Microglia)** 负责修剪发育不良的神经元。如果妈妈体内炎症水平高，这些细胞会变得过度活跃，开始吞噬健康的神经元。科学家认为这是**妊娠糖尿病**与孩子未来患精神疾病（如精神分裂症、自闭症、ADHD）风险增加之间的主要理论联系。

**Jessie Inchauspé**: There is some nuance, but that association holds very strongly. And as you said, 56 million mom baby pairs. So across the world, we see that when a mom has diabetes during pregnancy, her baby has a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. And the main theory that could explain this association has to do with the baby's brain. So your baby is forming his brain in the room. And today, Stephen, you have about a hundred billion neurons in your brain and they are the exact same neurons that you had the day you were born. Neurons never get replaced. So what does this mean? It means that your neurons that you have for life are formed during pregnancy in your mother's uterus. Now you have these neurons in the baby's brain being formed 250,000 per minute. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, neurons everywhere. And next to the neurons, you have another type of cell. This cell is called the micro ga. And it kind of looks like a starfish, and it's patrolling the baby's brain. And it's job is to make sure that the neurons are forming properly. So what micro ga do, they're a cell from the immune system, is they are on the lookout for any neurons that are being damaged or not formed properly. And as soon as they find a neuron that is not ideal, they go over to it and they eat it and they destroy it. So they're pruning the brain and they're looking out for damage and making sure everything develops normally. Now if the mother has high inflammation levels during pregnancy and this can be caused by a number of things. It can be caused by high glucose levels. It can be caused by infection. It can be caused by chemicals. High inflammation seems to be making these micro ga overactive. Now all of a sudden they become a bit deregulated and they start eating and destroying neurons that don't need to be destroyed. They start destroying healthy neurons and as a result the brain is forming in a slightly suboptimal fashion. And scientists believe this to be the leading theory behind why we see the association between gestational diabetes, so diabetes of pregnancy and a higher risk of psychiatric disorders.

### 实用的控糖技巧

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 即使在孕期，一些简单的技巧也能显著降低血糖峰值：
1. **蔬菜先行**：蔬菜中的纤维会在肠道形成保护网，减缓碳水化合物中葡萄糖的吸收。
2. **餐后运动**：进食后 90 分钟内活动身体。肌肉收缩时会主动消耗血液中的葡萄糖。
3. **简单动作**：比如在办公桌下做**提踵 (Calf Raises)**，锻炼比目鱼肌，它非常擅长吸收血糖。哪怕只做一分钟也比坐着不动好。
4. **咸味早餐**：选择富含蛋白质的早餐，避免开启全天的血糖过山车。

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Completely. And a lot of the glucose hacks that I've talked about, they actually mirror a lot of traditions. So for example, the glucose hack of having your vegetables at the beginning of your meal. This is incredibly powerful, pregnancy or not pregnancy, because vegetables contain fiber. And when you have them at the beginning of your meal, they create this protective mesh in your intestine that slows down the glucose molecules from carbs and makes the glucose molecules arrive more slowly into your bloodstream, meaning smaller spike. ... The best thing to do is to move your body. So get up, find a spot in your apartment that needs to be tidied. Find a place you got to vacuum. Find some find some laundry to do and do that within 90 minutes after eating. Your muscles are your best ally in reducing your glucose spikes after you've eaten. ... Calf raises. Yeah. Okay. So, put your feet on the ground, Stephen. Yeah. And just do some calf push-ups. Calf raises. So you go up onto the ends of your feet and back down. ... So as you do this, there's a muscle in your calf called the soles muscle. Can you feel it contract? It's your calf muscle. Okay. So this muscle is very good at soaking up glucose from your bloodstream. So easy hack you can do after you eat something sweet is you just do some calf raises at your desk like this. Nobody can notice. Five minutes and that's going to help reduce the glucose spike of what you just ate.

### 蛋白质与欧米茄-3

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 到了怀孕后期，宝宝对蛋白质的需求极大。如果不摄入足够的蛋白质，妈妈的肌肉会被分解以供应宝宝。低蛋白饮食会让宝宝产生表观遗传编程，使他们一生都倾向于较小的肌肉量。在第三阶段，我每天需要摄入约 4 个鸡蛋、3 份鸡胸肉量的蛋白质。

此外，**欧米茄-3 (Omega-3)**，特别是 **DHA**，能帮助宝宝的神经元建立连接。最便宜、最简单的来源是**沙丁鱼**。每周吃两次肥鱼（如沙丁鱼）就能提供宝宝所需的全部欧米茄-3。

**Jessie Inchauspé**: I think protein. By the time your baby's born, he is about 50% protein if you exclude water. So protein is not just for your muscles. Protein forms your immune system, your skin, your organs, many many tissues, many many signaling molecules in your body. So when you're pregnant, you need to eat more protein to give more protein to your baby. ... these animal studies suggest that if you have a low protein diet, your baby will be programmed to stay smaller and have smaller muscle mass throughout his life. ... So I would have four eggs in the morning. That's about 30 grams of protein. And then I would have to have three good servings of protein represented by the three chicken breasts here. ... I took omega-3 supplements because omega-3s also form the baby's brain and they come from algae in the ocean and fish. Now, omega-3s and in particular one omega-3 called DHA, it helps your baby's neurons connect with each other. ... The easiest way to get enough DHA is to eat fish or to eat sardines that we have here. So, the recommendation is fatty fish twice a week. I would say fatty fish three times a week if you can. And this is also it's amazing because it's very cheap.

### 个人经历：流产与焦虑

**Jessie Inchauspé**: 我在 2024 年春天经历了一次**稽留流产 (Silent Miscarriage)**。我以为一切都好，但在三个月的扫描时发现胚胎已经停止发育一个月了。那是我一生中最艰难的时刻之一。我感到愤怒、绝望和不公，因为我觉得自己做对了一切。

后来我才发现，五分之一的怀孕会以流产告终。这在很大程度上仍是一个禁忌话题。当我再次怀孕时，我非常焦虑，那是我人生中最焦虑的九个月。虽然我尝试了瑜伽、冥想和心理治疗，但那种恐惧挥之不去。我想告诉妈妈们，有些事情是我们无法控制的，但这并不意味着我们没有主导权。

**Jessie Inchauspé**: Yes. Correct. So I got pregnant the first time and I thought everything would be totally fine but I found out at the 3mon scan that the embryo had stopped developing. I had what's called a silent miscarriage. ... Listen, for me it was so devastating. It was so so difficult. I didn't I didn't want to believe it. I was screaming. I remember like falling to the floor in my living room and saying to whatever god or the universe like that I wanted my baby back. ... One in five pregnancies and in miscarriage. ... And then I got pregnant again in August 2024. And my son was born in May 2025. So, I got pregnant quite quickly afterwards. Um, but it was difficult because I was still carrying the grief of the miscarriage. So, I had a very anxious pregnancy. I was very anxious the whole time that something bad would happen again, that I would miscarry again and not know about it. It was very difficult.

**Jessie Inchauspé**: The closing message is pregnancy is complicated. The food system we live in is complicated and toxic. And this is a very simple four-step trimester by trimester plan that doesn't require a lot of money that is going to help you give your baby the best foundation during development. ... I'm hoping this book will fill it. I'm hoping like this is pie in the sky. Like why don't we prescribe nine months that count forever to every parent that gets pregnant.

**Stephen Bartlett**: Amen, Jesse. Thank you. ... highly recommend. Great book to buy for someone as a gift if you just found out that someone in your life is pregnant, but also a great book to buy for you and your partner if you're going through your own pregnancy journey or thinking about getting pregnant soon.
