### 播客开场与嘉宾介绍

**John Michael McGrath**: 欢迎大家收听 On Politics 播客。我是**约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉思**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Welcome everyone to the On Politics podcast. I'm John Michael McGrath.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 我是**萨布丽娜**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: I'm Sabrina.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 我是**艾米丽·古容·佩利耶**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: And I'm Emily Gujon Pelier.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 我们是一个关注省级政治的播客，但今天我们要讨论一位联邦议员辞职，以及这如何引发多米诺骨牌效应，一直影响到**皇后公园**的反对党席位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: We're a provincial politics podcast, but today we're talking about a federal MP resigning his seat and how that has dominoes falling all the way to the opposition benches at Queens Park.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 经过近15年的建设，**Eglinton Crosstown**终于有了开通日期。这次开通会顺利进行，还是会脱轨？与Eglinton Crosstown不同，**Darlington**核电站翻新项目提前完成并低于预算。这个计划如何融入安大略省的能源战略？为什么该省取消了其气候目标？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: And after nearly 15 years of construction, the Eglinton Crosstown finally has an opening date. Will the opening go smoothly or go off the rails? Unlike the Eglinton Crosstown, the Darlington refurbishment project was delivered ahead of time and under budget. How does the plan fit into Ontario's energy strategy and why did the province scrap its climate goals?

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 现在是2026年2月6日。那么，我们开始吧。我们的听众可能会注意到**史蒂夫**这周不在。相反，我请来了**萨布丽娜·纳尼**，她撰写**皇后公园观察家**，一份涵盖皇后公园所有事务的通讯；以及**艾米丽·古容·佩利耶**，她为**Leo**报道省级事务。感谢两位再次做客播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: It's February 6th, 2026. So, let's get to it. Our audience might note that Steve is not here this week. Instead, I am joined by Sabrina Nani, who writes the Queens Park Observer, a newsletter covering all things Queens Park, and Emily Gujon Pelier, who covers provincial affairs for Leo. Thank you both for being returned visitors to the podcast.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，很高兴来到这里。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, happy to be here. Thank you.

### 进步保守党大会与道格·福特

**John Michael McGrath**: 上周末，**进步保守党**举行了他们的大型大会。**道格·福特**发表了主旨演讲。萨布丽娜，你觉得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Last weekend the Progressive Conservative Party had their big convention. Doug Ford had the main headline speech. Sabrina, what did you think?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，我当时确实在场。进步保守党决定来个180度大转弯，实际上允许媒体进入会场听福特的演讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, I actually was there. The PCs decided to do a 180 and actually allow media into the room for Ford's speech. Yeah.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 抱歉，这里需要一点背景。我们最初被告知媒体不被允许进入，这与过去的惯例大相径庭，**皇后公园新闻记者团**理所当然地对此表示不满，最终**进步保守党**退让并允许记者进入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Sorry, a bit of context there. We were told initially that media would not be allowed, which was a huge departure from past practice, and the Queens Park press gallery rightfully made a bit of a stink about it and they eventually the PC party retreated and eventually did allow reporters in.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，不让我们进去有点奇怪，尤其是对于当晚的演讲。政治大会是你想鼓舞你的政党，发出一切顺利的信息的时候。显然，**道格·福特**有很多值得庆祝的事情。基本上，这是他赢得第三个多数席位一年后。演讲通常有很多套话，所以我认为不会发生什么重大争议。但他们确实让我们进了晚宴的房间。我不得不说，这次会议出席人数众多，也许是因为在隆冬时节，而且没有发生像我们在卡尔加里看到**皮埃尔·波利耶夫**和联邦保守党那样，一场高风险的领导层审查。现场大约有1000人。我交谈过的人似乎都很高兴能到场。一位先生告诉我，虽然大会有些部分很无聊，但他很高兴支持**道格·福特**。他非常满意福特的商业政策等等。演讲中有一个也许是计划外但实际上不太引人注意的部分，有几位抗议者站起来，开始高喊**格拉西纳罗斯**的汞污染问题，以及是否会有赔偿。**道格·福特**没有停顿，继续演讲。他的安保人员很快就把他们带走了。但我认为福特获得的最大掌声，他获得了起立鼓掌，是他表示将再次竞选第四个任期时。我不知道我们是否有人真正在考虑选举，但希望短期内不会有，尽管我们已经取消了固定选举日期，但福特表示他将是领导**进步保守党**的人。他是否会成功，我想这是个大问题。你提到了观感，有人暗示担心会场会有很多空位，因为联邦保守党在艾伯塔省举行了大会。有人认为，也许所有安大略省的积极分子都会去另一个省，他们没有足够的人来填满会场。有一些迹象表明他们真正担心的是这个，他们不喜欢省长对着半空房间演讲的想法。看来这并不是真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, it's a bit bizarre not to have us in there especially for the speech of the night. Like a political convention is when you want to, you know, pump up your party to kind of send the message out that everything's going well. Obviously **Doug Ford** had a lot to celebrate. You know, this is one year basically one year after his third majority mandate win. And the speech is usually pretty talking points heavy, so I don't think anything majorly controversial would be happening. But they did let us into the room for the dinner. And I have to say, you know, it was well attended for maybe the fact that it was in the middle of winter and not anything, you know, major happening like we saw in Calgary with **Pierre Poilievre** and the Federal Conservatives, you know, a big high stakes leadership review there. There were about a thousand people in the room. Folks I talked to seemed happy to be there. One fellow told me that while some parts of the convention were boring, you know, he was happy to support **Doug Ford**. He's really happy about his business policies and that sort of thing. One I guess maybe unplanned part of the speech and it was actually not really very noticeable but there were actually a couple of protesters that stood up and started shouting about **Grassy Narrows** and the mercury contamination there and you know whether there would be compensation for that. **Doug Ford** did not skip a beat and just kept on going. His OP detail got them right out very quickly. But I think the biggest applause that Ford got, he got a standing ovation, is when he said he was going to run again for a fourth term. I don't know if any of us are really thinking about an election yet, but you know, hopefully not one anytime soon, even though we've gotten rid of fixed election dates, but Ford said he's going to be the guy who will lead the PC party. Whether or not he'll be successful, I guess, is the big question. You mentioned the optics and there was some illusions to the concern that there would be a lot of empty seats in the room because of the federal conservative parties convention in Alberta. There was a thought that maybe all of the Ontario-based activists would be in another province. They wouldn't have enough people to fill the room. There was some hints that that was what they were really worried about that they didn't like the idea of the premier speaking to a half empty room. Seems like that wasn't the actual problem.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，我的意思是，看起来足够热闹。就像我说的，一千人，桌子都坐满了。但是，党内人士告诉我，他们认为一千人可能不是最强的数字，而且这里是代表们的较量，互相竞争的代表。**皮埃尔·波利耶夫**在他的大会上人数是这个的两倍多，但再说一次，我认为很多人去是因为他们想对他的领导权发表意见。有趣的是，我认为**进步保守党**，如果我在这里推测的话，可能期望更多人参加，因为他们实际上将早鸟票价保持在每位代表299美元，而通常会更高一些。这显然也是党的一种筹款举动。所以我认为他们保持较低的价格只是为了吸引更多人来。作为非会员观察员，你必须支付更多，1000美元。我确实在那里看到了自由党省议员**阿德尔·沙姆吉**。他被**进步保守党**的工作人员紧密跟踪。他不得不在外面寒冷中接受采访。但再说一次，我听说卡尔加里实际上是8度，所以我认为对于一些**进步保守党**来说，他们周末的天气可能更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, I mean it looked busy enough. Like I said, a thousand people, the tables were full. But you know, as in terms of what party insiders tell me is they don't think a thousand is maybe the strongest number and there were, you know, it was a battle of delegates, dueling delegates here. You know, **Pierre Poilievre** had more than double that at his convention, but again, I think a lot of people went because they wanted to have a say on his leadership. What was interesting is that I think the PCs, if I'm speculating here, might have expected more to attend because they actually kept their early bird pricing at like $299 per delegate and usually it's a little more than that. It's obviously a fundraising move too for the party. And so I think that they kept it at a lower rate just to get more people to come. You know, as a non-member observer, you got to pay a little bit more, $1,000. And I did see Liberal MPP **Adel Shamji** there. Very closely tailed by PC staff. He had to do his scrum outside in the cold. But again, I heard it was actually 8 degrees in Calgary, so I think for some PCs, they might have had the better weather over the weekend.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 艾米丽，你的看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Emily, your thoughts?

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 我没能参加，但从远处观看演讲，我唯一能想到的就是下一个口号会是什么，因为，你知道，在**皇后公园**，“保护安大略”已经有点像个老掉牙的笑话了。所以我一直在想这个问题，你知道，谁知道到下一次省选时，**唐纳德·特朗普**是否还在掌权。你知道，保护安大略的需求。到那时会变成什么样？省长还会像现在一样受欢迎吗？我当然期待那个新口号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Well, I didn't get to attend, but watching the speech from afar, all I could think about was what's the next slogan going to be because, you know, it's kind of becoming a bit of a running joke at Queens Park, the protect Ontario ad nauseam. So I was thinking about that a lot, you know, and who knows by the next provincial election, **Donald Trump** may or may not still be in power. You know, the need to protect Ontario. Where is it going to be by then? Is the premier gonna be still just as popular as he is now? Looking forward to that new slogan for sure.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的。不，我们这周不会做“你的专栏我的专栏”环节，但我确实对福特的评论有一些想法，人们可以在**tvo.org**上阅读。但你知道，一个简短的版本，正是你所说的，福特可以说：“好吧，我很高兴第四次领导我们的党”，但从现在到那时之间发生的事件将决定这一切，对吗？你知道，想想如果，例如，**民主党**在今年的中期选举中表现出色，而**特朗普总统**在一年后看起来更弱，情况会变得多么不同，对吗？“保护安大略”作为口号还有多少意义？你知道，从现在到那时，任何事情都可能发生。萨布丽娜，还有什么最后的想法吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah. No, we're not going to do a your column my column segment this week, but I did have thoughts about Ford's comments and people can read them at **tvo.org**, but you know, one short version exactly what you were saying that Ford can say, well, I'm excited to lead our party for a fourth time, but events between now and then are going to be what decide this, right? And you know, just think of how different things are going to be if, for example, the **Democratic Party** does very well in this year's midterm elections and President **Trump** looks weaker in a year's time, right? How much sense is Protect Ontario going to make as a slogan? Just, you know, any number of things can happen between now and then. Sabrina, any final thoughts?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，我想补充一点八卦，因为有传言说，一些内阁部长实际上在周六福特发表演讲时在场，他们可能正在考虑自己竞选领导人，也许如果**道格·福特**不干了，他们会成为下一任**进步保守党**领袖。他显然说他不会去任何地方，所以我认为这可能有点针对他们。但你说得对，我不认为这会是一帆风顺的。他现在在民意调查中表现出色。但谁知道政治格局会怎样。而且我认为福特的受欢迎程度不一定是因为人们真的喜欢他和他正在做的事情。而是因为目前缺乏好的反对党替代方案。所以我认为**新民主党**有很多工作要做。我知道我们稍后会谈到他们，但**自由党**也处于另一个领导真空期。所以很多事情都可能改变。你知道，到下一次选举到来时，可能已经十年甚至更久了，每个政府都有保质期。对于安大略人来说，总的来说，可能是时候改变了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, I wanted to add a little bit of gossip because there's these rumors that there have been some cabinet ministers who were actually in the room on Saturday when Ford made his speech that might be mulling over a leadership bid themselves, maybe you know the next PC captain if **Doug Ford** wasn't going to do it. He obviously said he's not going anywhere and so I think that was kind of pointed maybe a little bit towards them. But you're right, I don't think that it will be a slam dunk. He's riding high in the polls right now. But who knows what the political landscape is going to be. And I don't think Ford's popularity is necessarily because people really love him and what he's doing. It's because of a lack of good opposition alternatives right now. And so I think the **NDP** has a lot of work to do. I know we're going to talk about them a little bit later, but also the **Liberals** are in another leadership vacuum. And so a lot could change. You know, it will be a decade by the time or maybe more by the time the next election comes around and every government has a shelf life. It could be, you know, time for a change. Just in general for Ontarians.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的。再多说一点你刚才说的，如果他说了除了“我打算再次竞选，带领我们的党参加下一次选举”之外的任何话，那都将是为下一场领导人竞选发出的发令枪，无论是否宣布。对吧。所有那些早上醒来，在镜子里看到未来省长的内阁部长们，他们都会开始组织起来。当然他们会的，我们已经看到这种情况发生在其他政党身上，领导人挑战可能会使政府脱轨，即使省长不一定有退位的意图。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah. And just to sort of draw that out a little bit more what you were saying that if he had said anything other than I intend to run again to lead our party into the next election, it would have just been the you know firing the starter pistol for the next leadership race whether it was announced or not. Right. And all of those people, those cabinet ministers who you know wake up in the morning and they see a future premier in the mirror they would start organizing. Of course they would and we've seen this happen to other political parties where a leadership challenge can derail a government even if the premier doesn't necessarily have any intention of stepping aside.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Right.

</details>

### 联邦辞职引发的省级补选

**John Michael McGrath**: 好的，接下来我们讨论第一个议题。**比尔·布莱尔**直到本周还是**士嘉堡西南区**的联邦议员。那么我们为什么要谈论他呢？因为联邦自由党已经找到了替代他的人选，她就是同一选区的省级议员。关键是，她是**多莉·贝格姆**，**新民主党**副领袖，直到周二，她在官方反对党中仅次于**马里特·斯泰尔斯**。这里还有更多要讨论的，但我们先从这个开始。萨布丽娜，这对**斯泰尔斯**来说不是个好日子，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: And so with that we are going to go to issue one. **Bill Blair** was until this week the federal MP for the riding of **Scarborough Southwest**. So why are we talking about him? Because the federal **Liberals** have already found their candidate to replace him and she's the provincial MPP for the same writing. The catch, she's **Dolly Begum**, the **New Democrat** and deputy leader who was until Tuesday second only to **Marit Stiles** in the official opposition. There's more to discuss here, but we're going to start with that. Sabrina, not a great day for Stiles, was it?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 不，这是一个巨大的打击。你知道，**新民主党**领袖**马里特·斯泰尔斯**自己也说她完全被蒙在鼓里。她没想到她的副领袖会投奔另一个司法管辖区的另一个政党。我认为这真的让她措手不及。这是一个他们已经连续三次选举周期都占据的选区，所以我认为他们很难保住这个席位，只是因为补选有点像一张外卡，对吧？投票率往往较低。**道格·福特**必须在八月初之前举行补选。所以这可能是一个夏季事件，可能意味着投票率更低。我们确实知道所有政党都会为此非常努力。就**马里特**而言，我认为这很有趣，因为他们这周在**皇后公园**举行党团会议，我认为她会大张旗鼓地展示她的所有省议员都支持她，你知道，我们都在同一边，在同一个团队。但是，你知道，**马里特·斯泰尔斯**自上次选举以来确实遇到了一些障碍。我的意思是，他们失去了席位。他们失去了普选票的份额。自由党在这方面比他们做得更好。她在领导层审查中获得了非常惨烈的68%支持率。而且她，你知道，已经开始行动了。她已经改组了她的核心圈子，她的高级幕僚。她刚刚引进了**凯特琳·佩达福**，她曾为马尼托巴省的**瓦布·卡诺**工作，你知道，像西部的**雷切尔·诺特利**这样的成功**新民主党**领袖。所以我认为，尽管她一直在做出这些改变，也许这安抚了许多党员，但失去像这样的省议员对她来说只是一个巨大的打击。我知道我们会更多地讨论这个问题，但这真的引发了**皇后公园**乃至联邦层面的政治反应浪潮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: No, this was a huge blow. And you know, **NDP** leader **Marit Stiles** said herself that she was completely blindsided by this. She was not expecting her deputy leader to defect to another party in a whole other jurisdiction. This I think this really caught her off guard. It's a riding they've held for the last three election cycles and so I think it'll be difficult for them to keep the seat only because bi-elections are a bit of a wild card, right? Turnout tends to be lower. **Doug Ford** has to call the bi-election by the beginning of August essentially. And so this could be a summer thing. Could mean turnout is even lower. And we do know that all parties are going to be pushing very hard for this. In terms of **Marit**, I think it's interesting because they're having a caucus retreat at **Queens Park** this week and I think she'll really put on a big show about all her MPPs are aligned behind her, you know, we're all on one side on one team. But, you know, **Marit Stiles** has really had some obstacles since the last election. I mean, they lost seats. They lost the share of the popular vote. The **Liberals** did better on that front with them. She got a really bruising 68% in her leadership review. And she, you know, had started to roll. She's shaken up a lot of her inner circle, her top staffers. She just brought in **Caitlyn Pedaphor** who had worked for **Wab Kinew** and Manitoba, you know, successful **NDP** leaders like **Rachel Notley** out west. And so I think that while she has been making these changes and maybe that's appeased a lot of the party membership, losing an MPP like this is just a huge blow for her. And I know we're going to talk about it more, but like this has really just set off like a wave of political reactions across **Queens Park** and even federally.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的。我的意思是，我们已经看到前省议员们纷纷站出来批评该党的方向。你知道，这在**斯泰尔斯**成为领袖之前就开始了，并在她领导下继续。你提到了她在上次领导人投票中获得了68%的支持。这显然足以让她免于**邦妮·克朗普比**被罢免的命运，但考虑到**贝格姆**的离职，艾米丽，你认为我们是否会看到关于**斯泰尔斯**未来的问题重新浮出水面？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah. I mean, we've seen former MPPPs come out of the woodwork to criticize the direction of the party. You know, something that started before Stiles was leader and has continued under her. You mentioned her 68% support in the last leadership vote. That was obviously enough to spare her the fate of **Bonnie Crombie** who was turfed, but given that Beckham's departure, Emily, I mean, do you think that we are going to see questions about Stiles's future reopened?

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 嗯，那68%确实比**邦妮·克朗普比**在上次领导人投票中获得的57%高一点。但就你而言，未来几周肯定会有关于此的讨论，特别是如果你考虑到**安大略自由党**，尽管**克朗普比**在她自己的选区失利并辞职，但他们在**皇后公园**的席位数量确实增加了，如果他们选出一位更强的领导人，最终可能会获得一些势头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Well, that 68%, you know, is a little bit more than the 57% that **Bonnie Crombie** had received in her last leadership vote. But to your point, there certainly will be discussions around this in the coming weeks, especially if you consider the fact that the **Ontario Liberal Party** despite Crombie's loss in her own writing and her resignation did increase their numbers of seats at **Queen's Park** and might eventually get some momentum if they elect, you know, if the members decide to choose a stronger leader.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 对吧？那么说到竞选下一任**安大略自由党**领袖，**贝格姆**的辞职，这就像过去几天多米诺骨牌的倒塌一样。看着很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Right? And so speaking of the contest to be the next **Ontario Liberal** leader, Beckham's resignation, this is like how the dominoes have fallen in the last few days. It's been fun to watch.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，就叫它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yes, call it.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: **贝格姆**的辞职现在意味着**士嘉堡西南区**必须举行省级补选。现在我们来看第二条新闻，那就是**海滩东约克区**的自由党议员**内特·埃斯金-史密斯**，他迅速宣布将竞选**士嘉堡西南区**的自由党候选人。我不认为该党已经决定他是否会被直接任命为候选人，还是会进行有竞争的提名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: **Beckham's** resignation now means there has to be a by-election in **Scarborough Southwest** provincially. And now we get to our second piece of news, which is that the Liberal MP for **Beaches East York**, writing I live in, **Nate Erskine-Smith**, has quickly announced that he will be running to be the Liberal candidate in **Scarborough Southwest**. Don't believe the party has made a decision yet whether he will just be named the candidate or whether it will be a contested nomination.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 我们拭目以待。但他可能会与该选区最近的候选人，自由党人**卡迪拉·杰克逊**竞争。她在一份声明中说，**安大略自由党**需要一个全职候选人。这是**埃斯金-史密斯**在过去一年中一直面临的批评之一，即他将省级政治视为一种安慰奖，一个备用计划，因为他的联邦抱负未能如愿实现。从地理位置上讲，**海滩东约克区**和**士嘉堡西南区**是相邻的选区。**海滩东约克区**发生的许多社区活动往往会蔓延到**士嘉堡西南区**。我不得不相信**士嘉堡西南区**的选民认识**埃斯金-史密斯**的脸，知道他的名字，他非常熟悉。所以即使这次提名是有竞争的，我也必须想象他很有可能赢得自由党提名，并有可能赢得竞选本身。但正如你之前所说，萨布丽娜，我怀疑这将是一场竞争激烈的竞选，尤其是因为**进步保守党**和政府，省长可以决定补选的时机。继续关注**埃斯金-史密斯**和他的举动，你认为其意义何在？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: We'll see how that goes. But he will potentially be up against the most recent candidate in that writing who was Liberal **Kadira Jackson**. She said in a statement the **Ontario Liberal Party** needs a candidate who will be a full-time candidate. This is one of the criticisms that **Erskine-Smith** has faced consistently over the last year that he's treating provincial politics kind of like a consolation prize, a fallback plan given that his federal ambitions have not materialized the way he might have wanted. Just geographically, I'll say, you know, **Beaches East York** and **Scarborough Southwest**, they are adjacent writings. A lot of the community events that happen in **Beaches East York** will tend to bleed over into **Scarborough Southwest**. I have to believe that voters in **Scarborough Southwest**, they know **Erskine-Smith's** face, they know his name, he's very familiar. So even in the chance that this is a contested nomination, I have to imagine he's got a pretty solid chance of both winning the Liberal nomination and potentially winning the race itself. But as you said earlier, Sabrina, I mean I suspect this is going to be a very competitive race, not least because the **PC party** and the government, the premier gets to choose the timing of the by-election. Sticking with **Erskine-Smith** and his moves here, what do you think the significance are?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的，我的意思是，这基本上已经成为自由党领导人竞选的代理战，对吧？我私下和公开都听到自由党人说，如果党决定直接任命而不是进行有竞争的提名，他们会非常不满。我的意思是，就像你说的，前候选人**卡迪拉·杰克逊**已经开始猛烈抨击**内特·埃斯金-史密斯**。竞选还没有正式开始，但许多潜在的领导人候选人，尤其是那些没有席位的人，如果这是一场被认可的提名竞争，他们可能会不高兴。但就像你说的，我认为**内特**肯定会是领跑者。我认为他能成功。而且，如果你想成为一个政党的领导人并把事情做好，那么为什么不向所有人展示你能赢得提名，然后有可能赢得该选区呢。但有趣的是，听到**道格·福特**说他想让那个席位变成蓝色。自由党在过去三次选举中都排名第三。所以，对他们在**士嘉堡西南区**来说，这将是一场艰苦的战斗。但有趣的是，我认为如果**内特**成为候选人，**进步保守党**可能会推出一位非常高知名度的人选。他们曾在**士嘉堡吉尔德伍德区**推出前预算主席、多伦多市议员**加里·克劳福德**。所以我确实认为他们可以打一场漂亮的仗，并有可能从**新民主党**手中夺走这个席位。但有趣的是，如果**内特**成为候选人，这将是**进步保守党**攻击路线的预演，因为还记得**邦妮·克朗普比**成为领袖时，他们很快就推出了针对她的攻击性广告，而政治中的规则是，在你的对手这样做之前，先定义自己。我认为**邦妮·克朗普比**在这方面不是很有效。所以我认为我们将看到一个预演，预示着未来可能会发生什么，即使**埃斯金-史密斯**成为领袖，他当然也会是那场竞选的领跑者，但如果他能赢得这个席位，并在议会中获得一个席位，与**道格·福特**面对面，那将更具意义，因为**道格·福特**已经很久没有在立法机关面对自由党领袖了。我的意思是，他从未面对过一位永久领袖，对吧？在议会中。他只面对过临时领袖。是的，**约翰·弗雷泽**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah, I mean this has essentially become like a proxy war for the Liberal leadership contest, right? I've already heard from **Liberals** publicly and privately that they would be really upset if the party decided to make this an acclamation and not run a contested nomination. I mean, like you said, **Kadira Jackson**, the former candidate, just started ripping into **Nate Erskine-Smith**. The race isn't officially on yet, but a lot of potential leadership candidates, especially those who don't have a seat, might, you know, be unhappy if this was going to be an acclaimed nomination contest. But like you said, I think **Nate** would certainly be a front runner. I think he could pull it off. And, you know, if you want to be a leader of a party and do things right, then why not show everyone that you can win a nomination and then go on to potentially win the riding. But it was interesting to hear **Doug Ford** say he wants to turn that seat blue. The **Liberals** have placed third in the last three elections. So, it would be a bit of an uphill battle for them in **Scarborough Southwest**. But one interesting thing is I think if **Nate** were to be the candidate from the **PCs** who actually could get someone very high-profile, they had run **Gary Crawford**, former budget chair, Toronto counselor in **Scarborough Guildwood**. So I do think that they could put up a good fight and potentially take this seat from the **NDP**. But one interesting thing we'll just this is going to serve as like a preview if **Nate** is the candidate for the attack line that the **PCs** would have because remember when **Bonnie Crombie** became leader they were like so quick out of the gate with attack ads against her and that rule in politics is you know define yourself before your opponents can do it. I don't think **Bonnie Crombie** was very effective at that. And so I think we will see a bit of a sneak preview of you know what could happen down the line even if **Nate Erskine-Smith** becomes the leader and certainly he'd be a front runner in that race too but even more so if he does if he is able to win this seat and then have a seat in the house and go face to face with **Doug Ford** who has not faced a liberal leader in the legislature in quite some time. I mean, he's never faced a permanent leader, right? Across the house from him. Like, it's he's only ever faced interim leaders in the legis. Yeah. One guy, **John Fraser**.

**John Michael McGrath**: **约翰·弗雷泽**。

**John Michael McGrath**: **John Fraser**.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: **约翰·弗雷泽**即将第三次担任临时领袖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: **John Fraser** about to start his third time as interim leader.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 艾米丽，你的看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Emily, your thoughts?

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 嗯，我认为看看**内特·埃斯金-史密斯**能否确保在该选区竞选的能力，能否真正赢得席位，然后能否也成为领袖，这会很有趣，因为正如你所说，这将是自**凯瑟琳·韦恩**以来，我们第一次看到自由党领袖真正在议会中拥有席位。但我们也知道，在政治光谱上，**内特·埃斯金-史密斯**可能是我们很长时间以来见过的最进步的人。你知道，**邦妮·克朗普比**和**史蒂文·德尔·杜卡**被称为“红保守党”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Well, I think it would be interesting to see if one, **Nate Erskine-Smith** can secure, you know, the ability to run in the writing. To actually win the seat and then to also become leader because as you said this would be the first time since **Kathleen Wynne** that we see a liberal leader actually have a seat in the house. But we also know that on the political spectrum **Nate Erskine-Smith** is probably the most progressive that we have seen in a long time. You know **Bonnie Crombie** and **Steven Del Duca** being coined as red Tories.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 而且，你知道，他们把自己宣传为与**凯瑟琳·韦恩**的进步侧翼决裂，将党带向中间派，诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: And again, you know, advertise themselves as, you know, a break with **Kathleen Wynne's** progressive side of the party, bringing the party to the center, that kind of thing.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 而这正是人们所说的，**安大略自由党**需要这样做才能与**凯瑟琳·韦恩**形成对比，但这显然似乎不起作用。但回到**安大略新民主党**，我很好奇**内特·埃斯金-史密斯**领导自由党会对**新民主党**产生什么样的影响，因为他们被称为**皇后公园**更进步的政党。所以，这可能会对**安大略新民主党**和**马里特·斯泰尔斯**的领导层造成又一次打击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: And that's what's been said that that's what the **Liberal Party of Ontario** needed to contrast with **Kathleen Wynne**, but it clearly seems to not be working. But also going back to the **NDP** of Ontario, I'd be curious to see what kind of impact a **Nate Erskine-Smith** leadership for the **Liberal Party** would have on the **New Democrats** because they're known as the more progressive party at **Queen's Park**. So, another hit it would might be for for the **Ontario NDP** and **Marit Stiles** leadership.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 对吧？而且，你知道，我们已经在联邦层面一定程度上看到了这一点，**卡尼**的成功很大程度上是吸引**新民主党**选民到他这边，而不是其他任何事情，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Right? And you know, we've already seen this to a certain extent federally where, you know, **Carney's** success was as much just wooing **NDP** voters to his side as anything else, right?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 尤其现在有**多莉**在那里，我认为他正在巩固他的左翼。我的意思是，**马克·卡尼**一直被认为是，你知道，也许是一个小写c的保守党，这就是为什么**皮埃尔·波利耶夫**会感到挣扎。甚至一些**进步保守党**大会的代表告诉我，他们投票给了**马克·卡尼**，他们也支持他，他们也支持**道格**，这是因为，你知道，他们提出的这些商业导向的政策。所以我确实认为联邦自由党选择**多莉·贝格姆**对他们来说更有趣，也许能安抚他们一些更进步的选民。但是对于**内特**成为领袖，就像你说的，我不知道自由党还是**新民主党**会试图超越对方，那可能是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: And especially now with **Dolly** there who I think he's kind of securing his left flank. I mean, **Mark Carney** has been talked about as being, you know, maybe a small C conservative and that's why it's a struggle for **Pierre Poilievre**. Even some delegates at the **PC convention** were telling me that they voted for **Mark Carney** and they support him too and they support **Doug** and it's because of you know the these kind of businessminded policies that that they're putting forward. So I do think it was even more interesting for the federal **Liberals** to pick up **Dolly Begum** for them and maybe kind of appease some of their more progressive voters. But for **Nate** to be leader, like you said, like I don't know who's going to try to outflank each other, the **Liberals** or the **NDP**, that might be...

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: **绿党**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: The **Greens**.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 不能忘了他们。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Can't forget about them. Yeah.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 我想我最后一个想法是**埃斯金-史密斯**本周在他的声明中使用的措辞。他说他“全力投入”省级政治。我认为这非常有趣。正如我提到的，他在过去一年中一直面临一些批评，认为他将省级政治视为一种备用计划，他似乎正试图直接解决这个问题，说他没有B计划。他说，如果省级补选被宣布，他将辞去联邦议员席位，但在此之前，只是提醒大家，联邦仍然是少数党议会，所以他目前的承诺基本上是对总理的，就像“我在这里是自由党席位上的一个活人，这样你就不会在我辞职时失去一个席位”，但当省里宣布补选时，他将投身省级政治。关于自由党领导权，最后一点要告诉我们的听众。我们预计将在周一，我相信是2月9日，得知自由党领导人竞选的规则。我们一直关注的一个潜在候选人，我们在播客中提到过几次，是**丹妮尔·马丁**医生。她现在也正在竞选联邦自由党。她将是**大学-玫瑰谷区**的候选人，接替**克里斯托弗·弗里兰**。当**埃斯金-史密斯**辞去他的席位时，**海滩东约克区**将举行另一次联邦补选。至少还有一两位其他议员被猜测可能会辞职。所以我怀疑，对于联邦补选来说，这将是一个非常繁忙的春天。而且这里的情况仍然非常不稳定。但总而言之，萨布丽娜，你对自由党领导人竞选的规则有什么预感，或者你听到了什么消息吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: I guess my one last thought I will add here is just the language that **Erskine-Smith** has been using in his announcements this week. Saying that he's all in on provincial politics. I think is very interesting. As I mentioned, he's faced some criticism in the last year as treating provincial politics as a bit of a fallback plan and he seems to be trying to address that directly saying that there is no plan B for him. He has said that he will resign his federal seat if and when the provincial by-election is called and but until then just remind people it is still a minority parliament federally and so his commitment at the moment is basically to the prime minister like I'm here to be a warm body in the liberal benches so that you know you don't lose a seat when I resign but when the province calls that by-election he will be heading to provincial politics. Just one last note on the liberal leadership for our audience. We do expect to learn what the rules for the liberal leadership contest are going to be on Monday, I believe, on February 9th. One potential candidate we had been keeping an eye on. We've mentioned her a few times in the podcast was Dr. **Danielle Martin**. She is now also running federally for the **Liberals**. She will be their candidate in **University-Rosedale** to succeed **Christopher Freeland**. When **Erskine-Smith** does resign his seat, there will be another federal by-election in **Beaches East York**. There are at least one or two more other MPs who are being speculated as potentially resigning. So, it's going to be a very busy spring for federal by-elections, I suspect. And the situation here is still very fluid. But all that said, Sabrina, do you have any inklings about what we might expect in terms of the rules or are you hearing anything about the Liberal leadership?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的。嗯，所以我认为时间线是每个人都会关注的事情。我知道你们在专栏中曾提出越早越好。嗯，这很有道理，对吧？因为你有更多时间让安大略人了解你。你有更多时间应对**进步保守党**甚至**新民主党**的攻击路线。但是，我实际上与一些自由党人交谈过，他们一直在推动2027年的竞选，这让我很惊讶。一位内部人士告诉我，如果**皇家骑警**对**绿带**或**技能发展基金**的调查出现重大丑闻，那么**道格·福特**和**进步保守党**可能不会赢得下一次选举，这可能会吸引更多知名候选人参加自由党领导人竞选。这就像是，如果猪会飞呢？我的意思是，这是一个很大的“如果”，特别是如果你谈论的是推迟竞选。所以我最后听到的是可能在九月。但显然，我们下周会看到他们实际决定什么。而且我还听说他们将引入在线投票，这对该党来说将是一件新鲜事。但我认为这也会增加参与度，让更多人真正发表意见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah. So I think the timeline is the thing that everyone is going to be looking for. I know you guys in your column have kind of made the argument that sooner is better than later. And that makes sense, right? Because you have more time for Ontarians to get to know you. You have more times to combat whatever the attack line is going to be from the **PCs** and even the **NDP**. But some **Liberals** I've actually talked to have been pushing for a 2027 race, which surprised me. And one insider told me that, well, if you know there's a big scandal with the **RCMP** investigation on the **Greenbelt** or **Skills Development Fund**, then it might start looking like **Doug Ford** and the **PCs** would not win the next election and it might attract more high-profile candidates to the Liberal leadership race. And it was like, well, what if pigs start to fly? I mean, that's a big that's a that's a big, you know, what if, especially if you're talking about, you know, pushing the race down the line. So, the last I heard was potentially September. But obviously we'll see, you know, the actual what what they actually decide next week. And I also heard that they're going to be introducing online voting, which it would be a new thing for the party. But I think would also, you know, increase participation and get more people to actually have a say in this.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的。我不会重新阐述我关于更快领导人选举过程的整个论点，但我只想说，你知道，自**邦妮·克朗普比**领导人投票失败以来，或者无论你怎么说，她没有立即辞职，但在那段时间里，他们本可以已经完成一个领导人选举过程。他们本可以有一个新的领导人到位，而且那个领导人本可以，例如，在**士嘉堡西南区**补选中竞选，对吧？他们本可以利用这些事件。我真的认为该党在试图找出完美的流程方面过于精明，他们认为他们可以控制每个变量，但你就是不能，对吧？关键是要随机应变，利用事件的发生。是的，我就说到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yes. I I won't relitigate my entire sort of argument for a faster leadership process, but I will just say like, you know, in the time since **Bonnie Crombie's** unsuccessful leadership vote or however you want to put that, she didn't quite resign immediately, but in that time they could have already had a leadership process. They could have a new leader in place and like that leader would be in a position for example to run in the **Scarborough Southwest** by-election, right? They would be in a position to capitalize on these events. And I I really think that the party is getting too cute about like trying to figure out the perfect process that that that they'll control every variable and like you just can't, right? The point is to roll with the punches, so to speak, and and and actually capitalize on events as they happen. And yeah, that that I'll get off of my soap box.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 嗯，这可能也是**邦妮·克朗普比**的作为，因为记得在九月，有人质疑她是否会继续担任领袖，然后她说她不会，但她会留任直到我们找到新的人。现在她又说算了，我辞职了。所以，所有那些浪费的时间本可以被其他途径和机会填补，但，你知道，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Well, it might have been, you know, **Bonnie Crombie's** doing too because remember in September there were questions about whether she was going to stay on as leader and then she said she's not, but she's going to stay on until we find somebody new. And now she's saying never mind, I'm resigning. So, it's possible that all that wasted time could have been filled with, you know, other avenues and opportunities for the party, but you know,

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 他们似乎并不着急。所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: They did not seem to be in a terrible hurry. So,

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 当然，谈到领导人大会，我不得不提一下这里缺席的联合主持人。你知道，**史蒂夫**当然会在看屏幕时大喊：“说说代表大会的事！”这没有可能。我相信自由党宪法仍然要求采用排序投票。所以，无论他们是现场投票还是在线投票，都将是某种形式的排序投票。自由党当然在2020年，就在疫情之前，举行了我们认为在加拿大政治中最后一次实质性的代表大会，那是**德尔·杜卡**大会，所以那应该是2020年的一月或二月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Um, of course, with the discussion of leadership conventions, I just have to acknowledge the absent co-host here. You know, **Steve**, of course, is gonna be yelling at his screen watching the saying, "Say something about a delegated convention." No prospect of this. The I believe the Liberal Constitution still requires that it's a ranked ballot. So, they will whether they do in person or online voting, it will still be some form of ranked balloting. The **Liberals** of course held the last substantial delegated convention I think we're ever going to see in Canadian politics back in 20 god it was right before co right it was the **Del Duca** convention so it would have been the the January or February of 2020.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 嗯，这让**史蒂夫**深感不安，我们已经不再使用代表大会了。尽管如此，我们已经向前迈进，我们将继续讨论第二个议题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Um and it deeply upsets **Steve** that we've moved away from delegated conventions. Nevertheless we have moved on and we are going to move on to issue two.

### Eglinton Crosstown LRT 开通

**John Michael McGrath**: 标记你的日历。**Eglinton Crosstown LRT**的开通日期是2026年2月8日。这发生在近15年的建设延误和成本超支之后。这对这条线路来说是一个巨大的里程碑，也许是该省一个重大难题的结束，或者可能是一个新难题的开始。萨布丽娜，我们还需要知道什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Mark your calendars. The **Eglinton Crosstown LRT** has an opening date, February 8th, 2026. This comes after nearly 15 years of construction delays and cost overruns. It's a huge milestone for the line and perhaps the end of a major headache for the province or maybe the start of a new one. What else should we know here, Sabrina?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 所以，运营这条线路的**多伦多交通委员会 (TTC)** 将在周日分阶段启动。列车将从早上5:30运行到晚上11:00左右。第一天将免费。之后将有巴士运行。我想这是一种谨慎的做法。我们看到**芬奇西轻轨 (Finch West LRT)** 也是如此，它有点像一场灾难。开局并不顺利。**TTC**表示，分阶段启动是**渥太华轻轨 (Ottawa LRT)** 调查的建议。所以，可能是吸取了教训，但我认为当这个项目揭幕时，它不应该伴随着大量的宣传和剪彩。我认为还有很多问题需要回答，比如为什么花了这么长时间，成本如此之高。这个项目已经进行了15年，而且超出了预算。**道格·福特**前几天称其为一场噩梦，所以我认为会有更多的问题而不是其他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: So, the **TTC**, which is operating the line, is going to be doing a phased start on Sunday. Trains are running from 5:30 in the morning till around 11:00 at night. That'll be free on the first day. Buses will be running after that. It's I guess a cautious approach. And the same we saw with the **Finch West LRT** which has been a bit of a disaster. Not off to the greatest start there. And I you know the **TTC** says that the phase start was a recommendation from the inquiry into the **Ottawa LRT**. So potentially lessons learned, but I think when this thing is unveiled it shouldn't exactly be a ribbon cutting with a ton of fanfare. I think there's a lot of questions that still need to be answered about, you know, what took so long and cost so much. This thing has been, you know, 15 years now and over budget. **Doug Ford** called it a nightmare the other day and so I think that it'll be a lot more questions than anything.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的，艾米丽。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah, Emily.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 嗯，你知道吗？我认为很高兴知道**TTC**有兴趣遵循**渥太华轻轨**启动公共调查的建议。但我会说渥太华人长期以来所说的话，以及这里人们对**Eglinton Crosstown**开通日期所说的话：眼见为实。你知道，因为就在最近，**环球新闻**报道称，**芬奇西轻轨**使用的是一种与瘫痪**渥太华轻轨系统**的开关技术相似的技术，而公共调查曾警告其他交通系统不要使用它。所以，你得原谅我这次对**O-Train**的玩笑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Well, you know what? I think it's good to know that the **TTC** is interested in following through with the recommendations from the public inquiry into the **Ottawa LRT** launch. But I'll say what people in Ottawa said for a long time and what people have been saying here about the opening date for the **Eglinton Crosstown**. I'll believe it when I see it. You know, because just recently, **Global News** reported that the **Finch West LRT**, was using a switch technology that was similar to the one that crippled the **Ottawa LRT** system and that the public inquiry had warned other transit systems not to use it. So, you'll have to excuse the O-Train on this one.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 那么，给你们两位两个问题。你们打算在第一天就乘坐它吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: So, two questions for both of you. Do you intend to ride it on day one?

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Nope.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Nope.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 不，我不会乘坐它。但我知道很多记者会去，所以我很好奇结果会怎样。我想我有点被交通系统普遍吓到了。但是的，我并不抱太大希望，认为这个项目会像我们过去看到的其他轻轨那样顺利运行。但我正在等待看到那些大型的拍照活动和它会带来什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: No, I will not be riding it. But I know a lot of reporters will be and so I'm curious to see how that goes. Um, I I think I'm a little traumatized just from transit in general. Um, but yeah, I I don't have high hopes that this one will be running as smoothly as as we've seen, you know, just from past LRTs. Uh, but I I I I'm like waiting to see, you know, the big photo ops and and what comes out of it.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 他们说对于启动要耐心。你知道，他们告诉公众，哦，一路上会有一些障碍。那，你知道，我将等待障碍解决，然后也许我会体验到它的乐趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: They say you have to be patient about launches. You know, they tell the public, oh, you know, there's going to be some obstacles along the way. That's, you know, I'm going to wait for the obstacles to be done with and then maybe I'll I'll experience the joys of...

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 今天早上我家讨论过，你知道，我们是否会把孩子包好，你知道，周日会很冷，我们是否会去乘坐**Crosstown**？我还没有乘坐**芬奇轻轨**。所以，我们还没有做出那个决定。我们拭目以待。你知道，我不知道。我们在这个播客上谈论这条轻轨太多了，我们终于要走到故事的结局了，这真是太疯狂了。但是，我的一位同事在这里工作，当它投入运营时，他将能够依靠它。至少他将能够使用它。当我问他同样的问题时，他的回答是：“我不会相信它，直到我连续乘坐三次。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: There was some discussion in my household this morning about like, you know, would we like bundle up the kid and, you know, it's supposed to be really cold on Sunday, like would we go and ride the Crosstown? I still haven't gotten on the Finch LRT yet. So, we have yet to make that decision. We'll see. Um you know, it just I don't know. We've talked about this this LRT so much on this podcast and it is wild that we're like I think finally reaching the end of the story. Um but one of my colleagues who works here when it is up and running he is going to be able to rely on it. At least he will be able to use it. Uh and and his answer when I asked basically the same question was like I'm not going to believe it until I have written it three times in a row.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 所以，我们拭目以待。我相信下周我们会回来讨论早期的评论。但现在，让我们转向第三个议题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: So, we will see how it goes. We will be back next week to talk about the early reviews, I'm sure. But for that, for now, let's move on to issue three.

### Darlington 核电站翻新与气候政策

**John Michael McGrath**: 与**Eglinton Crosstown**不同，这里有一个提前完成并低于预算的项目：**Darlington 翻新项目**。该项目提前4个月完成，并节省了1.5亿美元，反应堆将于2月12日向省级电网供电。此次翻新还将使反应堆至少运行到2055年。艾米丽，有什么想法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Unlike the Eglinton Crosstown, here's something that was delivered ahead of time and under budget. The **Darlington refurbishment project**. The project was completed 4 months ahead of time and $150 million under budget, and the reactor will be delivering power to the provincial electricity grid on February 12th. The refurbishment will also keep the reactors going until at least 2055. Emily, thoughts?

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 嘿，准时，低于预算。继续保持。请多来点这样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Hey, on time, under budget. Keep it up. More of that, please.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 真是个好时代。你很少听到政府项目有这样的评价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: What a time to be alive. You don't hear that often about government projects.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 我的意思是，我认为有趣的是，**Darlington 翻新项目**和**Eglinton LRT**的预算都是大约130亿。尽管核电站翻新项目低于预算，但你知道，当你看到一个近130亿美元的项目时，1.5亿美元，你知道，大约是1.2%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Um I mean, I I thought it was interesting that the **Darlington refurbishment** and the **Eglinton LRT** had the same budget of about 13 billion each. Um and even though the nuclear refurbishment came in under budget, it was you know when you when you look at a uh 13 almost 13 billion dollars uh you know 1.5 or 150 million you know it's about 1.2%.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 所以这看起来不是杯水车薪，但仍然是政府显然在宣传的好消息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Um so it doesn't seem like a drop in the bucket but still you know something that the government was obviously pumping up and this was a good news story for them.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的，我得说，不是要扫大家的兴，但你知道，这不是**福特政府**做出的决定。**Darlington**和**Bruce Power**的翻新合同都是由自由党政府签署的。这是**凯瑟琳·韦恩**在能源问题对自由党变得完全有毒之前所做的事情之一。但是，你知道，他们已经确定了翻新核电站的方向，并重申了核能在该省的核心地位。当然，人们会争论核电到底有多清洁。它不直接产生温室气体排放，但当然有核废料。尽管如此，这占该省电力结构的50%左右。所以，你知道，你会认为这将是该省乐于谈论其雄心勃勃的气候政策的事情，但我几乎连说出来都想笑。艾米丽，你有一些关于该省气候政策的雄心，或者说缺乏雄心的报道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah, I will I will say not to, you know, rain on anybody's parade, but you know, this was not a decision that was made by the **Ford government**. The **Darlington** and **Bruce Power** Reefer contracts were both signed by a Liberal government. One of the things that **Kathleen Wynne** did back before the energy file became entirely toxic for the **Liberals**. Um but you know they they had you know set out the the direction of refurbishing the nuclear fleet and reaffirming the centrality of nuclear power in the province. People will argue of course about how clean nuclear power really is. Doesn't directly generate greenhouse gas emissions but there are is of course nuclear waste. Nevertheless, this is 50%ish of the province's electricity mix. So, you know, you would think that this would be, something that the province would love to talk about in terms of its ambitious climate policy, except I can barely even say that without laughing. Emily, you had some reporting about the ambitions of the provincial climate policies, or perhaps the lack of ambition.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 是的。嗯，你说得对。你知道，核电的清洁性是省政府每次在气候政策上受到批评或反对时经常用来辩护的论点。这也是他们最近用来证明废除立法规则的决定是正确的论点，这些规则曾强制他们设定气候目标并发布进展报告。我敢肯定你还记得，环境部长**托德·麦卡锡**曾多次表示，重要的是结果而不是目标。但我们通过信息自由请求发现，该部专家实际上曾研究过设定新目标的可能性，并在他决定完全废除这些目标之前，与部长分享了这些选项以及一些基于科学的事实。有趣的是，在该部对我们调查结果的回应中，他们指责**特朗普总统**及其对我们经济的攻击，称“保护安大略”，政府正在认真审视不必要的流程以及阻碍我们的不必要的流程。这就是他们的回应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Yeah. Well, you're right. You know, the cleanliness of nuclear power is something that's often used as an argument by the provincial government every time it receives criticism or push back on its climate policies. And it is an argument that they used recently just recently to justify the decision to get rid of the legislative rules that forced them to establish climate targets and publish progress reports. I'm sure you remember JMM the Minister of Environment **Todd McCarthy** has said multiple times that what matters isn't targets, it's results. But we did find out through a freedom of information request that the ministry experts had actually looked into the possibility of establishing new targets and had shared those options with the minister along with some science-based facts before he decided to just get rid of them altogether. And what was interesting too is in the ministry's response to our findings is that they blamed President **Trump** and his attacks on our economy protect Ontario and the government is taking a hard look at unnecessary processes and you know unnecessary processes that that are holding us back. That that was the response.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 在这种情况下，他们说气候目标就是那些不必要的流程之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: And in this case they're they're saying that the climate targets were one of those unnecessary processes.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Exactly.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 所以，我认为我们之前在播客中讨论过这个问题，但你知道，一些法律背景是，人们会记得安大略省曾被未成年人起诉，关于他们的宪章权利，即人身安全是否因该省比自由党政府继承的更不雄心勃勃的气候目标而受到侵犯。上诉法院曾表示，是的，如果政府要有气候目标，那么这些气候目标必须符合宪章，而政府似乎采纳了这一法院裁决，并实质上表示，既然如此，我们将根本不设定气候目标，根据你的报道，公共服务部门内部至少有一些关于可能采取不同路线的辩论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: So, I think we've talked about this on the podcast before, but you know, just some of the legal context was that people will remember that Ontario was being sued by minors, young people about whether their charter rights to personal security were violated by the province's less ambitious climate targets than the ones they that they inherited from the Liberal government. The court of appeal had said yes the if if the government is going to have climate targets then those climate targets have to comply with the charter and the government seems to have taken that court decision and in essence said well in that case we're not going to have climate targets at all and and based on your reporting there there was at least some debate within the public service about potentially taking a different course.

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 是的，当你与反对党，**新民主党**，**绿党**，以及环保专家交谈时，他们说这只是政府再次忽视自己的专家和科学的例子。但至少现在他们对此很诚实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: Yeah and when you talk to you know the opposition parties the **NDP** the **Greens** obviously and environmental experts. They say that this is just another instance where the government has ignored its own experts and well as well as the science. But that at least now they're being honest about it.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 好的，接下来我们进入邮件环节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: And with that, we're going to go to the mailbag.

### 市政选举展望与读者来信

**John Michael McGrath**: 如果你有什么迫切的问题或富有洞察力的评论，请发送到**onpolitics@tvo.org**。我将给我们的主持人一个机会，从这里的“仪式性邮件袋”中取出一封信。萨布丽娜，我们今天有什么？好的，这里有一封来自**温莎**的**马尔科姆·坎贝尔**的问题，他写道：“与**利亚姆·凯西**的精彩演讲。请他回来。更多关于**火环**的故事。另外，关于安大略省中心以外地区的选举故事怎么样？南安大略省，**温莎**，**查塔姆**，**埃塞克斯**，**拉萨尔**，**阿默斯特堡**。我们也有选举。我最好的温莎人，**马尔科姆·坎贝尔**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: If you've got a burning question or insightful comment, send it along to **onpolitics@tvo.org**. And I'm going to give one of our hosts a chance to reach into the ceremonial mailbag here. What do we have today, Sabrina? Okay, so here's a question from **Malcolm Campbell** in **Windsor** who writes, "Excellent presentation with **Liam Casey**. Bring him back. More stories on the **Ring of Fire**. Also, how about election stories of places not in the center of Ontario's universe? Southern Ontario, **Windsor**, **Chatham**, **Essex**, **LaSalle**, **Amherstburg**. We too hold elections. My best Windsorite **Malcolm Campbell**."

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 所以，**马尔科姆**的信当然是关于我们上周的节目。我们请来了**加拿大新闻社**的**利亚姆·凯西**来谈论他关于**火环**以及当地原住民社区政治的精彩专题文章。我们还提到了一些市政选举，但也许我们离多伦多，也许离这个办公室，对**马尔科姆**的口味来说还不够远。所以，是的，让我们谈谈其他城市。艾米丽，我们关注哪些城市？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: So, **Malcolm's** letter is of course in reference to our episode last week. We had **Liam Casey** from the **Canadian Press** on to talk about he did an excellent feature article about the **Ring of Fire** and the politics within the indigenous communities there. We also mentioned a few municipal races but perhaps we did not get far enough from Toronto, maybe far enough from this office for **Malcolm's** tastes. So yeah, let's talk about other municipalities. What are we keeping an eye on, Emily?

</details>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: 首先，我想说我完全同意这位**温莎**作家所说的一切。嗯，但就我而言，我肯定会关注**渥太华**。你知道，**市长马克·萨特克利夫**曾收到**进步保守党**和**道格·福特**的承诺，**O-Train**将升级到**Metrolinx**，但到目前为止，我们还没有看到任何行动。所以，看看选民是否认为**萨特克利夫市长**在该问题上为他的城市做了足够的游说，这会很有趣。而且因为**Leo**专注于**渥太华**和安大略东部的问题，我们将报道**普雷斯科特-拉塞尔区**以及所有具有强大法裔安大略人存在的安大略东部地区的市政选举，例如**康沃尔**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Emily Gujon Pelier**: First of all, I want to say that I agree fully with everything that this **Windsorite** writer has said. Um, but for my for my part, I'll be definitely looking at **Ottawa**. You know, **Mayor Mark Sutcliffe** had received a promise from the **PCs** and **Doug Ford** that the **O-Train** would be updated to **Metrolinx** and, you know, so far we haven't seen any action on that. So, it'll be interesting to see if the voters feel like **Mayor Sutcliffe** has been doing enough lobbying on behalf of his city to the province on that file. And because **Leo** has a focus on **Ottawa** and Eastern Ontario issues, we'll be covering the municipal elections for the region of **Prescott Russell** and, you know, all the Eastern Ontario regions that have a strong Franco Ontarian presence such as **Cornwall** as well.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 好的，萨布丽娜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Okay, Sabrina.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 所以，我不会说多伦多。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: So, I won't say Toronto. Okay.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 嗯，尽管我可能想说，但我不会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Um, even though I might want to, but I won't. Um,

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 规定我们都会关注多伦多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Stipulate that we're all gonna be watching Toronto.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的。嗯，但我会关注的另一个竞选是**密西沙加**。我希望这对**马尔科姆**来说足够远。但是，你知道，我认为这场竞选会很有趣。我们这周刚听到**道格·福特**对现任市长**卡罗琳·帕里什**大加赞扬，她接替了**邦妮·克朗普比**。你知道，福特说与她合作令人耳目一新，这是对**克朗普比**不那么隐晦的抨击。而且有传言说**克朗普比**可能正在考虑再次竞选市长，这会非常有趣。她显然没能在省级赢得她的席位，但也许她认为她在市政厅有更好的机会。而且，你知道，**卡罗琳·帕里什**在**克朗普比**担任市长时也是前市议员，两人之间确实没有任何好感。我认为**道格·福特**和**进步保守党**会支持谁，甚至可能会派一些志愿者去支持，这已经不是秘密了，但我实际上认为这将是一场非常有趣的对决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah. Um, but one other race I'll be looking at is **Mississauga**. I I hope that's far enough for **Malcolm**. But, you know, I think this race is going to be interesting. We just heard **Doug Ford** this week giving a glowing endorsement of **Carolyn Parish**, the current mayor who succeeded **Bonnie Crombie**. You know, Ford said it was refreshing to work with her, a not so thinly veiled shot at **Crombie**. And there has been rumors that **Crombie** might be looking to to run for mayor again, which which you know would be very interesting. She obviously wasn't able to win her seat there provincially, but maybe she thinks she's got a better shot at city hall. Uh and you know, **Carolyn Parish** was also a former counselor when **Crombie** was mayor, and there was really no love lost between those two. I think it's no secret who **Doug Ford** and the **PCs** would you know be supporting and and maybe send some volunteers down to to support during the race, but I actually think that would be a really um interesting matchup to watch.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 值得一提的是，**道格·福特**的背书并不总是能保证成功。当然，在多伦多的**梅瑞尔**补选中，他支持了前警察局长**马克·桑德斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Worth saying that an endorsement from **Doug Ford** does not always guarantee success. Of course, in the **Merill** by-election here in Toronto, he endorsed **Mark Saunders**, the former police chief who...

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 我觉得他排名第三。所以是的，就表现而言，并不是很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Came in third, I think. So yeah, it was not a great performance in terms of um...

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 省长的影响力，让我这么说吧。所以我将把目光放得更远一些，看向**萨德伯里**，那里已经争论了大约10年了。我上次写这个是在将近十年前，关于该市在哪里建造一个新的活动中心。我上次写的时候，争论的焦点是在城市外围建造。当时认为这种绿地选址是为城市创造大量新工作岗位的最佳方式。那个计划失宠了，他们决定在市中心更中心的位置建造一个活动中心。所以施工正在进行中，肯定预计今年夏天会进行。市政选举在十月。然而，本周有一位已宣布的候选人，一位市议员，他说他现在将竞选市长，声称他想停止施工，回到旧计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: The premier's coattails, let me put it that way. So I'm going to be looking a little bit further afield to **Sudbury** where there has been for like 10 years now. I last wrote about this nearly a decade ago, an argument in the city about where to build a new event center. Last time I wrote about it, there was the the fight was over building it out in the the periphery of the city. Um and the belief was that this sort of green field site was going to be the best way to generate lots of new jobs for the city. That plan fell out of favor and they decided to build a an event center more sort of centrally in the city's downtown. And so like the construction is I think underway certainly it is expected to be underway this summer. The municipal elections are in October. And yet this week there is a declared candidate, a city councilor who says he's now going to run for mayor saying he wants to stop the construction and go back to the old plan.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 嗯，所以你知道，在市政政治中，辩论从不会只发生一次，对吧？我们可以谈谈多伦多的交通投票历史，但我会关注**萨德伯里**的选举，看看这个特定问题是否会再次逆转。我还想补充一点，我们上周也谈到过，**萨德伯里**案件中的一个细节是，已宣布的候选人，那位市议员说，他将特别使用**强市长权力**来阻止这个竞技场，即使它已经在施工中。他将直接将其预算归零。当然，由于**福特政府**所做的改变，市长对他们的预算拥有强大的自由裁量权。你知道，这只是一个例子，我认为我们将在本选举季在全省各地看到很多这样的情况。各种市长候选人承诺使用**强市长权力**做一些重大甚至非凡的事情。这很有趣，因为我清楚地记得，在上次市政选举中，我们走访了各个城市，市议会候选人被问及他们是否会使用市长的**强市长权力**，而他们说“我们不会”是一个卖点。所以看看**萨德伯里**的选民对这个承诺有什么感受会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Um and so you know the no debate ever happens just once in municipal politics, right? We could talk about Toronto's history of transit votes, but I will be watching that election in **Sudbury** to see if this particular issue gets reversed once again. Um I I will also add and and we spoke a bit about about this last week that this one of the details in this **Sudbury** case is that the announced candidate the city councilor says that specifically he will use **strong mayor powers** to stop this arena even if it is already under construction. He will just zero out its budget. And of course, mayors have strong discretionary powers over their budgets thanks to changes made by the **Ford government**. And you know, this is just one example of something I think we're going to see a lot of in this election season all over the provinces. Various mayoral candidates promising to do major perhaps even extraordinary things with **strong mayor powers**. It's interesting because I can remember very clearly that at the last municipal elections, we were do making the rounds through the municipalities and and candidates for for city council asking them will you be using the mayor their **strong mayor powers** and it was a selling point for them to say that we are not. So it's going to be interesting to see what the voters of **Sudbury** feel about that promise.

</details>

**Sabrina Nani**: 是的。是的。不，而且我认为我们可能会看到这种政治略有变化，当它仍然有点新，对一些人来说可能有点可怕时，很多候选人认为最安全的是说：“不，我不会与这些**强市长权力**有任何关系。”随着选民对这个想法越来越习惯，也许，你知道，我们拭目以待。但也许至少有一些候选人愿意更直接地谈论使用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sabrina Nani**: Yeah. Yeah. No, and and I I think we might be seeing the politics of that change slightly where when it was still kind of new and perhaps scary to some people, a lot of candidates thought it was safest to say, "No, well, no, I I I'll have nothing to do with these **strong mayor powers**." And as voters sort of get used to the idea a bit more um perhaps, and you know, we'll see. Uh but perhaps at least some candidates are are willing to be a bit more um uh forward about uh using them.
