title: 解决住房危机：金融科技、供需失衡与资产通胀的视角

### 住房所有权：金融科技的终极前沿

住房在某种意义上对我来说，就像金融科技的最后一道前沿。它是大多数消费者的终极目标。所有金融科技在某些方面都引导消费者从根本上关注**代际财富**（generational wealth: 指家族财富通过几代人的积累和传承）。而代际财富，它来源于像房屋所有权这样的事物，对吗？它来源于长期的增值。它来源于为你、你的家人以及你家人的家人创造一个安全且可持续的东西。这就是美国梦。

<p class="english-text">Housing in some sense for me is like that final frontier of fintex. Sort of the end goal for most consumers. All of fintech in some ways leads to a consumer caring fundamentally about generational wealth. And generational wealth, it comes from things like home ownership, right? It comes from long-term appreciation. It comes from creating something that's safe and sustainable for you, your family, and your family's family. And that's the American dream.</p>
</details>

主持人: 部分问题在于所有老年人拥有所有的钱。这现在就像一个灾难性的问题。如果你领取现金工资，你每年可能获得3%的加薪，但**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 美国500家最大上市公司的股票指数）每年以10%的速度复合增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Part of the problem that all the old people have all the money. It is like a catastrophic issue right now. If you're getting paid in cash, you might get a 3% salary bump every year, but the S&P 500 like compounds at 10% a year.</p>
</details>

Alex: Alex，在2010年，购房者的平均年龄是30岁。现在是38岁。为什么会这样？我们能做些什么来改变它？嗯，我认为部分问题在于所有老年人拥有所有的钱，这确实是一个灾难性的问题，因为如果你回顾历史，美国梦长期以来一直是房屋所有权，我喜欢引用的例子是第二次世界大战之后。你们听说过**莱维敦**（Levittown: 二战后美国首批大规模规划的郊区住宅社区之一）吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alex, in in 2010, the median age for for a home buyer was 30 years old. Now it's 38. Why did that happen? And and what can we do to change that? Well, I think part of the problem is that all the old people have all the money that this really is a it is like a catastrophic issue right now because if you look back I mean like the the American dream has been home ownership for a very long time and the example that I like to point to is after World War II. Um have you heard of Levittown?</p>
</details>

主持人: 没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No.</p>
</details>

Alex: 那么莱维敦？你们听说过莱维敦吗？好的。那么莱维敦，Verun你肯定知道莱维敦，但这曾是首批批量建造的住宅社区之一。所以，嗯，这个人，想想**亨利·福特**（Henry Ford: 福特汽车创始人，开创了汽车流水线生产）为汽车做了什么。就像，在福特之前你怎么能买到汽车？它们就像是手工制作的东西，非常非常昂贵。而且，嗯，我想是詹姆斯·莱维特，他实际上有点种族主义，但这又是另一个话题了。但是，呃，所以莱维敦是第一个将亨利·福特的工厂模式引入住房建设的地方。嗯，呃，这实际上是纽约的一个城镇，你知道，建造了数千套房屋。嗯，把它们卖给了返乡的**美国大兵**（GIs: 二战时期对美国士兵的俗称），就像房屋所有权一样，你拥有大量的土地。你有一个国家，你知道，只有今天一半的大小。嗯，呃，你知道，就是供需关系。所以你没有像所有老年人拥有所有钱的情况。你有一个庞大的人口渴望拥有房屋，而且有大量的供应正在建设，实际上还有新的创新建筑技术，这就是我喜欢提到莱维敦的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Levittown? You ever heard of Levtown? Okay. So Levittown, sure you know Levittown, Vern, but but this was one of the first track housing communities. So, um, this guy, think about what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Like, how could you buy a car before Ford? It's like these were handmade things that were very, very expensive. And, um, I think it was um, James Levit um, who actually turned out to be somewhat of a racist, but that's a different topic. But, uh, so Levittown was the first like I'm going to bring the Henry Ford factory to housing. Um, and uh, this is it's actually a town in New York, you know, built like I think it was thousands of homes. Um, sold them to GIs that were coming back and like home ownership was just like you had lots of land. You had a country that was, you know, half the size that is today. Um, and uh, just you know, supply and demand. So you had you didn't have like all the old people had all the money. you had this like giant giant population that wanted home ownership and you had lots of supply that was being built and actually new innovative techniques for building and that's why I like to point to Levittown.</p>
</details>

### 资产价格通胀与住房可负担性

Alex: 嗯，呃，自那以后发生的事情是，如果你看看，你知道，你可以看看谁的金字塔，我必须把通货膨胀看作是两回事。你有**消费者物价指数**（CPI: Consumer Price Index: 衡量一篮子商品和服务价格变化的指标），你知道，**劳工统计局**（Bureau of Labor Statistics: 美国劳工部下属机构，负责收集和分析劳工统计数据）会制定一篮子商品和服务，比如汽油、面包、鱼、鸡蛋和黄油等等。你知道，它们会变得更贵，也会变得更便宜。但还有另一种我称之为**资产价格通胀**（asset price inflation: 资产价格上涨，不直接计入CPI）的东西，它实际上不属于CPI的一部分。CPI的一部分是租金，或者，你知道，可能是抵押贷款支付，它有效地让你住在你的房子里。嗯，但是呃，资产价格通胀非常非常不同。所以，嗯，我们前段时间写了一篇文章，显示旧金山湾区的房价在过去25年里大幅下降，人们会说不不，没有。它上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and uh what what has happened since is if you just look at you know you could look at the pyramid of who like I got to think about um inflation as being two different things. You've got the CPI which is this, you know, you come up with the the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes up with the basket of goods and services like gas is one or bread is one or, you know, fish and eggs and butter and things like that. You know, they get more expensive, they get cheaper. But then there's this other thing that I would call asset price inflation, which is not actually part of the CPI. Part of the CPI is rent or, you know, perhaps like the mortgage payment that effectively allows you to live in your house. Um but uh asset price inflation is very very different. So um there's a there's a piece that we wrote a little while ago showing that the price of housing in the Bay Area has declined massively in the past 25 years and people like no no it hasn't. It's gone up.</p>
</details>

主持人: 如果你用**苹果**（Apple: 跨国科技公司）股票和**谷歌**（Google: 跨国科技公司）股票来定价的话，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you price it in Apple stock and Google stock,</p>
</details>

Alex: 对吗？所以如果你已经拥有一项资产，这项资产可以是股票，或者你的父母给你留下了很多钱和一栋老房子。嗯，呃，供需关系，那里的房地产数量是固定的。苹果的股票数量也是固定的。就像这些相对于美元的价值已经上涨了。就像这些人今天可以买房。嗯，他们绝大多数都是年龄较大的人。年轻人真的很难负担他们的第一套房子，因为他们领取现金工资。就像大多数人一样，如果你领取现金工资，你知道，你每年可能获得3%的加薪，但标普500指数每年以10%的速度复合增长。而且如果你是用一篮子资产购买，嗯，显然你不会用苹果股票来支付你的房子，但如果你恰好在苹果工作，那么在过去25年里，湾区的房价已经便宜了很多。如果你恰好在一家你没有任何所有权的公司工作，你只是领取工资，那么房价就变得昂贵了很多。所以，有很多原因可以回答你的问题，或者说我如何回答你的问题，但我认为从根本上说，这是主要原因。首先是供需关系，我们建造的房屋不够多。嗯，这与莱维敦地区非常不同，那里就像“哇，我们要建造大量的房屋”，这在1950年代确实发生了。嗯，所以这就是供需关系。嗯，然后还有这种资产价格通胀，它确实为拥有资产和没有资产的人创造了“双城记”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? So if you already have one asset and one asset would be stock or one asset would be like your parents left you a lot of money and they left you an old house. Well, um supply and demand there's only a fixed amount of real estate there. there's only a fixed amount of Apple shares. Like those have gone up in value relative to the US dollar. Like these are the people that can buy homes today. Um and they are just predominantly and disproportionately older. And it is really hard for younger people to to afford their first house because they get paid in cash. Like most people, if you're get if you're getting paid in cash, you know, you might get a 3% salary bump every year, but like the S&P 500 like compounds at 10% a year. And if you're buying with a basket of assets, um, and obviously you're not paying for your house with, you know, Apple shares, but if you happen to work at Apple, like houses have gotten a lot cheaper in the Bay Area in 25 years. If you happen to work at a company where you have no ownership in anything, you're just getting paid a salary, like house prices have gotten a lot more expensive. So, it's there are many reasons why I would answer your question or how I could answer your question, but I think fundamentally that's the the main one. Like number one is supply and demand is that we don't build enough homes. Um very very different than like the Levittown area where it's like wow we're going to build like a shitload of homes and that really really happened in in the 1950s. Um so that that's so it's supply and demand. Um and then it's also this kind of like asset price inflation which has really kind of created this tale of two cities for people that have assets and people that do not.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么资产价格通胀是解释为什么老年人拥有所有财富的最佳理由吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And is is asset price inflation the best explanation for why how old people got got all the money so to speak?</p>
</details>

Alex: 是的。是的。基本上，嗯，尤其是在建造更容易的地方。有资产价格通胀，但一百年前建造房屋也比今天容易得多。嗯，所以，这与住房无关，但是，好吧，爸爸。建造**帝国大厦**（Empire State Building: 纽约市标志性摩天大楼）花了多长时间？你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Basically, it's like um especially where it was if it was much easier to build. There's asset price inflation, but there's also it was much easier to build a 100 years ago than it than it is today. Um so, this is not about housing, but All right, pop. How long did it take to build the Empire State Building? What do you think?</p>
</details>

主持人: 呃，一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh a year.</p>
</details>

Alex: 呃，你觉得我们在哪里？建造帝国大厦花了多长时间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh what do you think we're in? How long did it take to build the Empire State Building?</p>
</details>

主持人: 五年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Five years.</p>
</details>

Alex: 从开始到结束110天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">110 days from start to finish.</p>
</details>

主持人: 截至今天，我永远也无法拥有它。我的意思是

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As of today, I could never have it. I mean like</p>
</details>

Alex: 如果你现在想换一块窗玻璃，可能需要两年时间。所以你知道另一件事是，不仅仅是老年人拥有所有的钱。嗯，那是一个问题。但是当老年人没有所有的钱但购买了大量这些房产时，建造东西要容易得多。所以现在，建造变得非常非常困难是第一点。如果你明天就能建造1000万套房屋，你认为房价会发生什么变化？它们会上涨还是下跌？我很确定它们会下跌，除非所有经济学家都错了，关于供需关系，你知道，交点就是均衡价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you wanted to change like a window pane it would probably take two years right now. So you know the other thing is that it's not just that the old people have all the money. Um that that's a problem. But it was much easier to build things when the old people didn't have all the money but bought a lot of these these properties. So So now it's just it's much much much harder to build is number one. If you could just go build 10 million homes tomorrow, what do you think would happen to the price of homes? Would they go up or down? pretty sure they would go down like unless every economist is wrong about like supply and demand you know being the you know the intersection being the equilibrium price</p>
</details>

主持人: 而主要的瓶颈是监管。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the main bottleneck there being regulatory.</p>
</details>

Alex: 我的意思是它是监管问题，但实际上并不总是监管问题，呃，它是这个术语**邻避主义**（NIMBYism: Not In My Backyard，指居民反对在自家附近建设不受欢迎设施的现象）。所以想象一下我买了一栋房子，我知道我隔壁拥有房子的老年人，他们通过拥有那栋房子赚了很多钱，因为他们在1960年买的。这实际上是一个真实的故事。嗯，我买的第一套房子在**帕洛阿尔托**（Palo Alto: 美国加州城市，硅谷所在地），我记得是在2008年以210万美元买的。呃，时机非常完美，在**雷曼兄弟**（Lehman Brothers: 曾是美国第四大投资银行，2008年破产引发全球金融危机）倒闭之前。我想在世界崩溃之前买一套房子。不，那不是真的。我应该在三个月后买的，因为它跌了50%，我的隔壁邻居，嗯，他是一位退休的**斯坦福大学**（Stanford University: 美国顶尖私立研究型大学）教授。嗯，他大概在1960年买的房子，地块比我的大，价值也比我的高，只花了大约3万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it's regulatory but actually it's not regulatory um always it's uh it's this term nimism not in my backyard. So imagine that I bought a house and I know that the old people that own the house you know next to mine they've made so much money by owning that house because they bought it in 1960. This is actually a true story. Um, my first house I bought was in Palo Alto and I bought it for I think it was uh $2.1 million in 2008. Uh, very perfectly timed before Lehman Brothers failed. I figured I wanted to buy a house before like the world fell apart. No, that's not true. I should have bought it like three months later because it went down 50% and my next door neighbors um it was a retired Stanford professor. um he bought the house I think in 1960 um bigger lot than mine worth more than mine for like $30,000.</p>
</details>

主持人: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah.</p>
</details>

Alex: 所以，嗯，如果他希望那3万美元变成更多，这很自然，每个人都想要，如果我买的东西不是消耗品，比如我不在乎这瓶水增值。我在乎我的房子增值。如果你在我房子旁边建造1000万套房子

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um and if he wants that $30,000 to turn into more and like that's a natural thing everybody wants whatever if I buy something and it's not a consumable like I don't care about this water increasing in value. I care about my house increasing in value. If you build 10 million houses right next to mine</p>
</details>

主持人: 房子就会贬值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the house is going to go down in value.</p>
</details>

Alex: 所以这就是邻避主义，邻避主义随后变成了监管，然后你就会有，你知道，人们投票给那些会给他们想要的东西的人，那就是邻避主义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's nimism and nimiism then becomes regulatory and then you have you know you have people that vote for people that will give them what they want which is nibism.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以这不仅仅是说你有一些邪恶的政客突然说我们现在需要花10年时间去建造一些东西，或者你不能建造东西。也是人们的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's not just like you have evil politicians that out of nowhere say we now need to take 10 years to go build something or you can't build things. It's it's people as well.</p>
</details>

Alex: 是的。Verun，你对听到这些有什么感想或反应吗？或者你认为我们如何才能增加房屋所有权？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Verun any reflections reactions to hearing this or what are your thoughts to how we can increase home ownership?</p>
</details>

### 文化转变与技术创新

Verun: 是的，我的意思是，我认为Alex说得非常对。嗯，现实是过去二三十年里，围绕住房发生了很多变化，对吗？比如文化转变、更高的房价、更高的利率。但我前几天读到一个很酷的统计数据，比如在1950年代，入门级房屋的平均面积大约是985平方英尺。如果你看看今天入门级房屋的面积，你知道，猜猜是多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah I mean I think Alex is right on the money. Um the reality is there's just a lot of things that have shifted over the past 20, 30 years around housing, right? Like it's cultural shifts, it's higher home prices, it's higher rates. But I I read a cool stat the other day that like in the 50s the average price or the average size of a starter home was like 985 square ft. And if you look at the size of a starter home today, just, you know, any guesses on what that is?</p>
</details>

主持人: 是多少？我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is it? I have no idea.</p>
</details>

Verun: 差不多是2500平方英尺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like almost 2500 square feet.</p>
</details>

主持人: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

Verun: 所以，我们对房屋的文化期望已经发生了根本性的改变。但你也有其他代际动态，对吗？比如今天的人们，嗯，在生活中安定下来得更晚一些。嗯，Alex谈到了可负担性，但你知道，有些人想买房，但他们就是无法跨越那个可负担性的障碍。所以，嗯，我认为当我们思考未来时，还有其他一些事情会改善。比如建造房屋的成本必须下降，对吗？我认为像**机器人技术**（robotics）、**3D打印**（3D printing）、材料科学的进步都会对此有所帮助。但那还有点远。我的意思是，这场**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence）革命的好处在于，它不仅能帮助我们应对今天看到的**ChatGPT**（由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）和**Anthropic**（一家AI安全公司）正在做的以及**Agentic AI**（自主代理AI）等所有传统用例，它更像是应用于机器人技术、3D打印和材料科学等领域的AI。但我认为我们的文化已经发生了一些根本性的转变，对入门级房屋的期望也发生了变化，但你必须从另一个角度解决问题，而这正是在技术领域也需要更多范式转变的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, our expectations like culturally around like what a home is have like fundamentally changed. But you also have these other generational dynamics too, right? Like people today um are settling down a little bit later in life. Um, and Alex talked about affordability, but you know, some people want to buy, but they just can't clear that affordability hurdle. And so, um, there are other things that I think will improve as we think about like the future. Like the cost of building a home has got to come down, right? And I think things like robotics, um, 3D printing, you know, advancements in material science will help with that. But that's a little bit further out into the future. I mean the nice thing about this AI revolution is it's not just that it will help us with all the traditional use cases that you see today around like chachi PT and what anthropic is doing and agentic AI etc etc but it's more like applied AI in the context of like robotics and um advancements in 3D printing material science but I think like our culture has fundamentally shifted a little bit the expectations around a starter home has shifted um but then you have to attack the problem from the other way and that's where you need a little bit more of a paradigm shift in the technology space as well.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。如果你必须预测未来五到七年内，房屋所有权的过程会如何改变，或者我们分享的关于房屋所有权的统计数据会如何变化，你有什么期望？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. If you had to predict over the next, you know, five to seven years how sort of the process of home ownership changes or or or sort of the the stats that we shared around home ownership, what what you expect?</p>
</details>

Verun: 是的，我认为有几件事会发生根本性的改变。我的意思是，我认为你将开始看到人工智能的应用在本质上更具几何性。所以，计算机不会仅仅在知识型工作方面表现出色，它还能处理制造、建筑，以及更多流程、工作流和物理任务。Alex有一个关于“比特问题”与“原子问题”的绝妙类比，我认为**安德森·霍洛维茨**（Andreessen Horowitz: 知名风险投资公司，常简称为a16z）非常擅长开创这些，所以我认为你将开始看到这一点，并且我认为这将显著改变整个制造业环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there are a couple things that would that would change fundamentally. I mean, I think you'll start to see the applications of AI be a little bit more geometric in nature. And so it won't be that a computer is smart at you know the knowledge worker type jobs but it can handle manufacturing building um and just more sort of process and workflow and like physical tasks right Alex has a great analogy around um bit problems versus atoms problems that um I think Adric said very famous for pioneering so I think you'll you'll sort of start to see that and I think that will significantly change just the manufacturing environment in general</p>
</details>

Verun: 嗯，我认为你还会看到的另一件事是，今天房屋所有权动态中的部分问题在于，之所以耗时如此之长，是因为有很多工作，对吗？比如提供你的数据，提供你的文件。这是一个庞大的资格审查过程，涉及**承保**（underwriting: 金融机构评估风险并决定是否提供贷款或保险的过程）、资格审查、资金流动等复杂术语。但就像，为什么走进杂货店用信用卡买一块巧克力棒如此容易，而购房过程却只是同一件事稍微复杂一点的版本。所以我设想在三到五年内，很多工作流程会得到高度压缩，消费者及其财务准备情况和资格标准将实时发生。所以我认为这有点令人兴奋，因为首先，你知道，了解你是否有资格购买像房屋这样昂贵的东西所需的努力可以大大压缩；其次，你会看到技术上更多的飞跃，建造、制造和维护房屋的过程会简化。我认为如果我们做对了，我们就能开始看到——这也是我认为政府理所当然关注的问题——如何以更快的速度建造更多新房，对吗？回到Alex之前的观点，你如何让市场上有更多的库存，这会产生更大的价格压力，这样即使抵押贷款利率很高，至少房屋成本可以下降。所以我看到这些交叉点开始影响整个过程，希望最终能惠及消费者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I think the other thing that you'll also see is just today part of the problem with the home ownership dynamic is that like the reason it takes so long is there's just a lot of work, right? Like providing your data, providing your documents. It's a gigantic qualification process that involves these complicated terms like underwriting and um, uh, qualification, money movement, etc. But it's like why is it so easy to walk into a grocery store and buy a chocolate bar with a credit card and yet the process of buying a home is just a slightly more complicated version of the same thing. And so I imagine in 3 to 5 years a lot of that workflow gets like hyperco compressed and a consumer and their sort of financial um readiness and their qualification criteria is just something that happens in real time. And so I think that's kind of exciting because one like you know the amount of effort to know whether you qualify for something as expensive as a home purchase can be significantly compressed and then two you know you start to see more leaprogs in technology where you know the process of building manufacturing servicing a home kind of come down and I think if we get that right you know we can start to see and this is something that I think the administration is rightfully focused on is that like how do we get more new homes built at a faster rate, right? And to Alex's point earlier, how do you get more inventory on the market, which would create more price pressure so that even if mortgage rates are, you know, are elevated or high, at least the cost of the home can come down. And so I I sort of see these these these intersection points starting to just influence the process hopefully for the benefit of of that consumer.</p>

Alex: 是的，我的意思是，我认为技术方面，这就是为什么我当时快速使用**ChatGPT**（由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）来刷新我对莱维敦的记忆，但我的意思是，这是1947年第一个规划的郊区。所以当时有很多返乡的美国大兵，就像我们需要为所有这些回来的人建造住房。比如你做了什么？记得二战后那张著名的照片吗？一个美国大兵俯身亲吻一个女人。他们在那之后做了什么？他们结婚了。他们买了一栋房子。他们生了五个孩子，因此出现了**婴儿潮**（baby boom: 指特定时期内出生率显著上升的现象）。嗯，他们需要住在某个地方，显然那是一栋985平方英尺的房子。嗯，但其中很多房子都是如此迅速地建造起来的。嗯，实际上技术一点也不差，但它就像是“让我们把亨利·福特的工厂模式带到住房建设中去”。那是呃，那是莱维特父子公司，**威廉·莱维特**（William Levitt: 美国房地产开发商，以大规模建造莱维敦而闻名）。嗯，再次强调，他们做了一些不好的事情，比如他们曾有一个著名的规定。就像你不能租或卖给非白人。嗯，所以那部分显然很糟糕，但好的一面是，我们要建造大量的房屋，并且要以更智能的方式建造。嗯，我的意思是，因为如果你有一个房屋的装配线，顺便说一句，像**莱纳公司**（Lennar Corporation: 美国最大的房屋建筑商之一）和其他公司，当他们决定购买一大片土地并开发时，他们也会这样做。嗯，他们不会只建造一栋房子，然后完成，再建造下一栋。看着这些社区被建造起来真的很酷，因为它就像“好的，今天是地基日”，然后他们就做所有这些事情，比如打地基。好的，今天是框架日。砰砰砰砰砰，这些东西建造得非常非常快。很多房屋建造，是的，Verun，我同意你的观点，这就像“原子与比特”的问题。就像建造东西真的很难。但我们确实有解决方案。比如**模块化住宅**（modular housing: 预制房屋，在工厂建造后运到现场组装）并不是一个白日梦。你可以做到。嗯，有一个非常酷的著名中国视频，有点像一个**网络迷因**（meme: 在互联网上迅速传播的文化现象或内容），一个女人展示她的房车之家。看，淋浴间。看这个。这很有趣。它就像一个非常流行的**抖音**（TikTok: 流行短视频平台）或YouTube短视频。但你可以做到这一点。我的意思是，所以我认为有三件主要的事情。你需要让人们尽可能容易地购买房屋。嗯，这确实是，就像我以前从未做过一样。我一生中只买一次房子。我该怎么办？我只知道我每个月付房租。我知道那是怎么回事。就像我害怕这个房屋所有权的过程。我在哪里买？我会被出价更高吗？我能拿到抵押贷款吗？啊，这听起来太复杂了。我还是继续租房吧。而最重要的一点是，很多人租房，他们确实想买房。这并不令人惊讶。你宁愿像美国梦一样拥有一栋房子吗？你目前租房。你想成为美国梦的一部分吗？每个人都会说“是”。你如何让它尽可能简单？这就是让购买过程尽可能简单。这就是让它尽可能负担得起。然后当你考虑可负担性时，可能就是金融方面，也就是抵押贷款。嗯，你知道，美国实际上相当独特，因为大多数国家没有30年期的抵押贷款来偿还本金和利息。有时会有较短的期限。嗯，但你有金融方面，然后你有建筑方面。而且你知道，我更了解金融方面而不是建筑方面，但这两者，如果你让它更便宜，你猜怎么着？更多人会想要，你将打开这个机会。我要补充的另一件事是，我很久以前做过一个关于这个的演讲。嗯，我从没想过做一个关于房屋所有权和住房以及所有正在发生的事情的演讲会受欢迎，但不知何故，我制作的那个小视频很受欢迎。嗯，呃，我认为在“我租房”或“我拥有”之间，需要减少这种二元对立。就像那样。很多涌现出来的创新，比如**爱彼迎**（Airbnb: 全球知名的民宿预订平台）是什么？就像你拥有这块房地产，你用它做什么？嗯，同样，你可以租它，也可以拥有它。你只有两个选择。不，不，不。你可以租一个月，或者你可以买它，你可以省钱，或者更确切地说，帮助你支付款项，或者有第二份收入等等，因为2028年奥运会将在洛杉矶举行。你在体育场附近有一个小公寓。把它租出去一个月。就像那是一种创新，它实际上使房屋所有权更具可负担性。所以，嗯，或者你知道，我们曾是一家帮助实现**先租后买**（rent-to-own: 一种租赁协议，租户有权在未来购买租赁的房产）的公司投资者。你租房，但你基本上每个月都在“烧掉”你的租金，因为它在获得房屋所有权方面没有任何帮助。如果你能得到一栋你以后有权购买的房子呢？嗯，顺便说一句，这在一定程度上也会降低住房成本，因为**沃伦·巴菲特**（Warren Buffett: 著名投资家，伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司董事长兼CEO）有一句我非常喜欢的话，那就是没有人会花钱去洗一辆租赁的汽车，对吗？这很有道理。你为什么要为**赫兹租车**（Hertz: 国际知名的汽车租赁公司）洗车，对吗？你要把它还回去。所以，嗯，如果你知道你将购买你租的房子，你可能会更好地照顾它。如果你更好地照顾它，那么房东就不必担心那么多事情，然后成本就会下降。所以，你知道，我认为技术，更重要的是创业精神，可以帮助推动很多中间环节。嗯，但你需要一个允许这样做的监管环境。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean I think the technology thing I mean that's why I I was like kind of quickly chat gpting um to refresh my memory on Levittown, but I mean this was the first planned suburb and uh um this in 1947. So this was all these returning GIS and it's like we need to build housing for all of these people that came back. Like what did you do? Remember like the famous picture post World War II where the GI is like kind of swooping this woman down and kissing her. It's like what did they do after that? They got married. They bought a house. They had five kids and hence the baby boom. Um well, they needed to live somewhere and apparently it was a 985 foot house. Um but a lot of these were just like constructed so quickly. Um and actually like the the technology wasn't bad at all, but it it was like let's go bring the Henry Ford factory to housing. And that was uh that was Levit and Sons, William Levit. Um and again, they they did some bad stuff like they famously had something. It's like you could not rent or sell to somebody who was not white. Um so so that part obviously bad but the good part was we are going to build just like a shitload of homes and we're going to do it in a smarter way. Um and I mean because if you have an assembly line for homes and by the way like LAR and others like they do a version of this when they decide to go buy a giant tract of land and go develop it. Um they don't just like build one house and then finish that and then build the next house. It's really cool watching these communities get built because it is it's like okay we're going to today is foundation day and it's like foundation foundation like they just do all of these things. Okay, today is framing day. Boom boom boom boom boom and these things go up very very quickly. A lot of home building and this Yeah, Ver and I agree with you like it's the atoms versus bits thing. It's like it's just really hard to construct things. But we do have solutions to this. Like modular housing is not a it's not like a pipe dream. You can do this. Um there's this very cool famous uh like Chinese uh it's almost like a meme, but like this woman that's like showing off her like, you know, here's like this RV home. Look shower. Look this. And it's it's pretty funny. It's got like it's like this very popular Tik Tok, you know, YouTube short thing. But you could do this. I mean, so I think you have like three main things. You need to make it as easy as possible for people to buy the house. Um, and it really is it's like I've never done this before. I buy a house once every lifetime. What do I do? All I know is that I pay my rent every month. I know how that works. Like I'm scared from this process of home ownership. Where do I buy? Do I get outbid? Do I get a mortgage? Ah, this sounds so complicated. I'm gonna keep renting. And the biggest thing that people I mean so many people that rent, they do want to buy. Like this is not this is not surprising. Would you rather like the American dream is to own a house. You currently rent. Do you want to be a part of the American dream? Everybody's going to say yes. How do you make it as easy as possible? And it's kind of making the process of buying as easy as possible. It's making it as affordable as possible. And then when you go under the affordability, it's probably the financial side which is is is mortgage. Um, and you know, the United States is actually quite unique in that most countries, they don't have 30-year term mortgages to repay your principal and interest. Sometimes you'll have shorter duration. Um, but it's you have the financial side and then you have the construction side. And you know, I I know more about the financial side than the construction side, but both of these like if you make it cheaper, like guess what? More people will want to you're going to open up this aperture. And the other thing that I would add, I gave a presentation about this a long time ago. Um, I never thought it would be popular to have I'm gonna give a presentation on like home ownership and housing and all these things that are happening and somehow that was that was a that was a popular little video that I made. Um, and uh I think there needs to be more of a le less of a binary between I either rent or I own. Like that was it. And a lot of these innovations that have popped up like what is Airbnb? Like you have this piece of real estate and what do you do with it? Well, again you can rent it or you can own it. You only have two options. No, no, no. You can rent it for a month or you can buy it and you can save money or rather help make your payments or have a second source of income or whatever because the Olympics are coming to LA in 2028. You have a a little apartment near the stadium. Go rent it out for a month. Like that's an innovation that has actually made home ownership more affordable. So, um or you know we we were an investor in a company that was helping do rent to own. you rent, but like you're throw you're basically setting on fire your rental payment every single month because it does not help you in any way, shape, or form in terms of getting ownership in a house. What if you could get a house that you have the right to buy later? Um, which by the way would actually bring down housing costs as well to a certain extent because there's a saying by Warren Buffett which I love, which is nobody pays to wash a rental car, right? Like that makes sense. Why would you wash a car for hurts, right? You're returning it. So, um, if you know that you're going to buy your rental, you'll probably take better care of it. If you take better care of it, well, the landlord doesn't have to worry about as many things and then the cost goes down. So, you know, there there's a lot of inbetweens that I think technology and actually more importantly, entrepreneurship can help drive. Um, but you need a regulatory environment that allows it.</p>

### 金融工程与抵押贷款的演变

Alex: 是的，我的意思是，有些**区块链**（blockchain: 一种分布式数据库技术，以块链式结构存储数据）的东西对我来说真的没有意义。嗯，我是**加密货币**（crypto: 基于区块链技术的数字货币）的忠实粉丝，但加密货币的存在就像，如果你交易纯粹是数字化的东西，那效果很好。如果你说你要代表某种物理存在的东西，你需要主张你的所有权。比如如果有人非法住在我的房子里，那叫他们闯入我的家。然后我打电话报警，我说我住在这里。Eric闯进来了。把他赶出去。你可以这样做。但如果我说不，不，不。区块链上说Eric...不不不，就像我们有持枪的人来执行法律，他们根据县记录员的信息来查看谁拥有房产，你知道，它应该那样运作吗？我不知道，但它就是那样运作的，所以像那些东西我不太确定，但是，嗯，是的，我们投资了一家名为**Point**（一家提供房屋净值投资的公司）的公司，它允许你出售部分房屋，嗯，很多人都是“房产富裕但现金贫乏”，这又是另一个没有意义的事情，比如如果我有5万美元的信用卡债务和620的**FICO信用分**（FICO: Fair Isaac Corporation，美国最常用的信用评分模型），但我是在1950年买的房子，并且拥有100%的所有权。这没有道理。就像，我不应该为了还清信用卡而卖掉我的房子。就像，为什么我不卖掉我房子10%的份额呢？就像，这样的事情，只是为了打破“我要么租房要么拥有”或者“我要么拥有全部房子要么一无所有”这种二元对立。就像，你可以通过给人们更多选择，在边缘地带变得更有创意。

<p class="english-text">yeah I mean there's the blockchain stuff that doesn't really make sense to me.

If you're tra if you're saying I'm going to represent something that's physical where I need to assert my ownership. Like if somebody's living in my house illegally, that's called they broke into my home. And then I I call the police and I say I live here. Eric broke in. Kick him out. And like you can do that. But if I say no, no, no. on the blockchain it says that Eric sh like no no no it's like like we have like the guys with guns enforce the laws and they look at like who owns the property based on like the county recorders information and like you know should it work that way I don't know that's how it works so like that stuff I I'm not sure but um but yeah I mean we're an investor in a company called Point that allows you to sell part of your house and um you have a lot of people that are like you know they're houserich cash poor and again that's another thing that doesn't make sense like if I have $50,000 in credit card debt and a 620 FICO, but I bought a house in 1950 and I own 100% of it. It's like that doesn't make sense. Like, I shouldn't have to sell my house so I can pay off my credit. Like, why don't I sell 10% of my house? Like, stuff like that to just take a binary of like I either rent or I own or I either own all my house or none of my house. Like, you can get a little bit more creative around the edges by giving people more more options.</p>

主持人: 我想转入并深入探讨抵押贷款。Alex，你长期以来一直在金融科技领域投资并建立公司。抵押贷款科技领域是如何被看待的？抵押贷款和金融科技是如何协同工作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I want to segue uh and go deeper into into mortgage. Alex, you've been investing in fintech for for a long time and bu building companies in the space. How how is the space viewed uh the mortgage tech space? How sort of mortgage and fintech work together?</p>
</details>

Alex: 嗯，我认为抵押贷款真正有趣的地方是，嗯，我将在这里讲一个背景故事。这是我的小寓言或故事。呃，我上了大学。我没有信用卡。嗯，我去了**哈佛大学**（Harvard University: 美国顶尖私立研究型大学），那里有一家商店叫哈佛合作社（Harvard Coop），或者叫Coop，你在那里买教科书和其他所有东西。所以，我想要一张信用卡，他们说：“申请一张哈佛合作社信用卡，你就能得到一件T恤。”我当时想，“哇，我想要一件T恤。这听起来很棒。”嗯，所以我申请了这张卡。我有一个，我想是75美元的信用额度。呃，你知道，给了我很多很多信用。嗯，那是一家叫做**第一美国银行**（First USA: 曾是美国一家大型信用卡发行银行，后被收购）的银行，它最终变成了其他东西，然后又变成了其他东西，我想最终变成了**摩根大通**（Chase: JPMorgan Chase & Co.旗下的零售银行品牌）。所以，我拿到了我的卡，他们给了我一件免费T恤。嗯，他们为什么真的想要我这个客户？就像，他们不是因为觉得我是个超级模特，想让我穿他们的T恤。为什么他们给了我T恤，给了我卡？嗯，他们有点押注于此，我们谈论过很多，有**客户获取成本**（CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost: 获得一个新客户所需的成本）和**客户生命周期价值**（LTV: Lifetime Value: 客户在与公司关系期间可能产生的总收入）。客户获取成本就是T恤。客户生命周期价值不是指我在18岁时，他们只给我75美元的信用额度，我能为他们赚多少钱。客户生命周期价值是如果我坚持使用那家银行，最终我将进行一笔非常有价值的交易。我的意思是，银行通过**净息差**（net interest margin: 银行贷款收益与存款成本之间的差额）赚钱。所以他们吸收存款，发放贷款。作为个人，我可能会从这家银行获得哪种贷款，能为他们创造很多价值？可能是抵押贷款。所以，对于一家银行或许多金融服务公司来说，关键的转折点是，你知道，我现在有了Eric或Alex或Verun作为借款人。嗯，我将从他们身上赚很多钱，但我有点不得不，我不能只是在最后一刻出现。这实际上很好地引出了我认为**Rocket Companies**（一家大型抵押贷款公司）和Verun通过他们的一些收购正在推动的许多很棒的事情。但我不能只是在最后一刻出现，然后说：“嘿，呃，我知道我以前从未见过你。我从未给你免费T恤。你和我没有任何财务关系。你知道，这是一笔抵押贷款。”你会说，不，我要从以前给我T恤的那个人那里获得，或者从我的房地产经纪人那里获得。但是客户生命周期价值，就像，在金融领域很有趣，**LTV**（Loan-to-Value: 贷款价值比）通常意味着贷款与价值比，对吗？所以，比如房子的价值是200万美元。我获得了100万美元的贷款。那就是50%的贷款价值比。但是，嗯，在大多数初创公司领域，当我们谈论LTV时，我们谈论的是客户生命周期价值。而消费者的大部分客户生命周期价值，即使是18岁的消费者，也可能在未来15年后购买房屋时实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I think what's really interesting about mortgage is um I I'll I'll kind of tell a story by by background here. Here's my little parable or story. Uh I get I get to college. I don't have a credit card. Um, I I went to Harvard and there's a store called the Harvard Coupe or it's a co-op, but it's called the Coupe and that's where you buy your textbooks and everything else. So, I want a credit card and they're like, "Apply for a Harvard Coupe credit card and you get a t-shirt." I was like, "Woo, I want a t-shirt. That sounds great." Um, so I applied for this card. I had a I think it was $75 credit limit. Uh, you know, lot lot of credit that was extended to me. Um, and it was a bank called First USA, which eventually became something else, which eventually became something else, which I think eventually became Chase. So, I got my card and they gave me a free t-shirt. Um, why did they really want me as a customer? Like, they didn't want to just like they didn't think I was like a supermodel and they wanted to put my the their t-shirt on me. Why is it that they gave me the t-shirt that they gave me the card? Well, they were kind of betting on, we talked about this a lot, there's CAC and there's LTV. The customer acquisition cost was t-shirt. The lifetime value is not like how much money I'm going to make for them at 18 when they only extend me $75 of credit. The lifetime value is if I stick with that bank eventually I'm going to make a very very valuable transaction. I mean banks bank money on net interest margin. So they take deposits, they make loans. What kind of loan might I as an individual take out with this bank that would generate a lot of value for them? Probably a mortgage. So the key inflection point for uh a bank or a lot of financial services companies is, you know, I now have Eric or Alex or Verun as a as a borrower. Um I'm going to make a lot of money on them, but I kind of have to I can't just like show up at the 23rd hour. It's actually a good segue for a lot of the cool stuff that I think Rocket and Verun are pushing for with some of the acquisitions that they've made. But I can't just show up at the 23rd hour and say, "Hey, uh I know I've never met you before. I've never given you a free t-shirt. you have no financial relationship with me whatsoever. You know, here's a mortgage. You're like, nah, I'm going to get it from the guy that gave me a t-shirt before, or I'm going to get it from like my real estate broker. But the lifetime value, like, it's funny in in finance, LTV normally means loan to value, right? So, like the value of the house is $2 million. I got a $1 million loan. That's 50% loan to value. But, um, in most of like startup land, when we talk about LTV, we talk about lifetime value. And the majority of lifetime value for a consumer, even an 18-year-old, is going to happen probably 15 years later in the future when they buy a house.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那是一个非常有价值的转折点，或者当他们获得**房屋净值信用额度**（HELOC: Home Equity Line of Credit: 一种以房屋净值为抵押的循环信用贷款）时，它是一种金融产品，你负责任地获得一笔大额贷款。你会偿还它，但在那个时间点赚到的钱，远比你18岁时拿着75美元信用额度的信用卡获得免费T恤时多得多。Verun，你对抵押贷款和金融科技的这种交集有什么补充吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That that's such a valuable inflection point or when they get a heliloc or like it it's it's a financial product where you are taking a large loan responsibly. You're going to pay it back, but the amount of money made at that point in time is so much higher than when you're an 18-year-old kid and getting a free t-shirt with your $75 limit credit card. Run, what would you add to sort of this intersection of of of mortgage and fintech?</p>

Verun: 有这样一句台词突然出现在我脑海里，你知道，她有点骗了他，你知道，从他那里得到了一些信息，然后他问：“你为什么要这样做？”她想了一会儿，然后说：“为了抵押贷款。”那句话一直在我脑海里，因为在某些方面，你知道，我从事金融科技已经很长时间了。你知道，那是在**贝宝**（PayPal: 国际知名的在线支付平台）吗？那是在**高朋**（Groupon: 团购网站）吗？我当时很投入。所以当人们想到金融科技时，他们会想到个人贷款、支付、投资、税务、资金流动，你知道，很多这类业务。但我从与许多消费者交谈中学到的一件事是，所有这些都只是达到目的的手段。住房在某种意义上对我来说，就像金融科技的最后一道前沿，因为它对大多数消费者来说是终极目标。当你想到租房时，Alex说得非常好。租房就像是一个漏斗的一部分，是通向购买的连续过程，对吗？所以对我来说，所有这些都导向住房，对吗？住房对经济如此重要。它占**国内生产总值**（GDP: Gross Domestic Product: 衡量一个国家经济活动的指标）的20%，对吗？一个5万亿美元的市场。而且它非常复杂，对吗？就像它是碎片化的。它有很多变动的部分。抵押贷款过程本身也很有趣，对吗？就像你有贷款的概念，比如你有一个发起人来承保贷款并带你到交割台，然后一旦交割完成，你就有抵押贷款票据本身，然后它被出售给二级市场。到这些政府资助的企业，比如**房利美**（Fannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage Association，美国政府资助企业，提供抵押贷款服务）和**房地美**（Freddie Mac: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation，美国政府资助企业，提供抵押贷款服务），他们利用这些来释放资本并保持流动性。然后你有抵押贷款服务权，你知道，作为消费者，你与抵押贷款有一种持续的关系，因为这通常是任何消费者一生中最大的一笔交易，你管理你的付款、房产税和**第三方托管账户**（escrows: 由第三方保管资金或文件，直到交易条件满足）。我认为真正有趣的是，所有这些部分和流程都演变得非常分散，对吗？你有房屋搜索和房地产体验，你使用像**Redfin**（一家提供房地产经纪服务的科技公司）或**Zillow**（美国知名的在线房地产数据库和市场平台）这样的网站来完成旅程的这一部分。然后你有抵押贷款过程，你在那里申请融资和信用，你知道，你通过产权调查，通过评估，然后你完成交易，然后进入服务阶段。这些都是等式中完全不同的部分，这就是为什么客户生命周期价值与客户获取成本的比率如此重要。就像通常当你评估金融科技或任何消费业务中的企业或公司时，你会考虑客户生命周期价值与客户获取成本的比率，你会想，这种关系的客户生命周期价值相对于客户获取成本是多少。住房的普遍问题在于，如果你把它看作一个漏斗，所有这些环节都是分散的，对吗？就像消费者基本上从一个漏斗飞出，进入另一个漏斗。所以考虑到这个行业有多么庞大，以及交易有多么巨大，经济效益并不理想。所以真正让我着迷的是，首先，你知道，所有金融科技在某些方面都引导消费者从根本上关注代际财富。而代际财富，它来源于像房屋所有权这样的事物，对吗？它来源于长期的增值。它来源于为你、你的家人以及你家人的家人创造一个安全且可持续的东西。这就是美国梦。这就是我们所思考的。但这个行业的经济效益却异常分散。所以这就是为什么，你知道，对我们来说，很多都围绕着整合，对吗？它是关于更多的**垂直整合**（vertical integration: 企业将供应链中不同环节的业务合并到一起）。它是关于连接体验的这些部分，因为我们认为我们可以首先建立更好的体验。其次，我们可以创造更高的效率，从而降低成本；第三，完全改变业务的经济效益，创造出一种更像新物种的东西。所以，嗯，是的，抵押贷款是一个非常有趣的业务。你知道，我相对来说是新手。我在这个领域和行业里只待了大约两年，但它令人着迷。我的意思是，它如此庞大，对经济如此基础。从长远来看，它对消费者如此重要，然而却有如此多的机会去现代化、改造和改进它。所以，嗯，是的，所有这些都让我感到兴奋。

<p class="english-text">You know, there's a there's a great movie that came out like I think it was around 15 20 years ago. It's called Thank You for Smoking. I don't know if you guys have ever seen that one. David Sax produced it. There's this there's this one line that popped into my head where, you know, she kind of scams him, you know, and gets some information out of him and he's like, "Why did you do this?" And she thinks for a second and she says, "For the mortgage." And that line that line has always stayed with me because in some ways, you know, I've been around fintech for a long time. You know, was that PayPal? Was that Groupon? I was that into it. And so like when people think about fintech, they think about like, you know, personal loans, payments, investing, taxes, money movement, you know, a lot of these kinds of businesses. But like one thing I I've learned just from talking to a lot of consumers is like all of those are a means to an end. And housing in some sense for me is like that final frontier of fintech because it's sort of the end goal for most consumers. And Alex said it really well when you think about renting. It's like renting is part of a funnel that is a continuum toward buying, right? And so all of it to me leads to housing, right? And housing is is so important to the economy. It's 20% of the GDP, right?$5 trillion market. And it's very complicated, right? Like it's fragmented. It's got a lot of moving parts. And the mortgage process itself is also really interesting, right? Like you have the the concept of a loan, like you have an originator that underwrites a loan and brings you to the closing table and then once it's closed, you have like the mortgage note itself and that gets sold off to the secondary market. to these um these GSC's, government sponsored exchanges like Fanny and Freddy and they use that to kind of free up the capital and maintain liquidity. Then you have like the mortgage servicing rights which is where you know kind of an you have an ongoing relationship with the mortgage as a consumer because it's you know typically the biggest transaction any consumer is going to make in their life where you manage your payments, your property taxes and your escros. And what I think is like really interesting is that like all these parts and processes have evolved to be like very disperate, right? You have like the home search and real estate experience where you you use websites like you know Red Fin or Zillow to kind of go through that part of the journey. Then you have the mortgage process which you which is where you apply for financing and and credit you know you go through title and you go through appraisal and then you close and then you go into servicing. And these are all like completely different parts of the equation, which is why that LTV to CAC thing is like so important. Like typically when you value a business or a company in fintech or really any consumer business, you think about LTV to CAC and you think about well what's the lifetime value of this relationship relative to the customer acquisition cost. And the problem with housing in general is that these sort of if you think about it as a funnel, they're all like disperate, right? like a consumer essentially flies out of one funnel and into another funnel. And so the economics are not great given how big of an industry it is and just, you know, how big of a transaction it is. And so that's something that really fascinated me is that like one, you know, all of fintech in some ways leads to a consumer caring fundamentally about generational wealth. And generational wealth, it comes from things like home ownership, right? It comes from long-term appreciation. And it comes from, you know, creating something that's safe and sustainable for you and your family and your family's family. And that's the American dream. That's what we've thought about. But the economics of the business are incredibly disperate. And so that's why, you know, for us, a lot of it has been around just integration, right? It's about more vertical integration. It's about connecting these parts of the the the experience because we think we can one build a better experience. two, we can create a lot more efficiency and therefore lower the cost, but then three, just completely change the economics of the business as well and just sort of create something that is a bit more of a new species. And so, um, yeah, mortgage is a really interesting business. You know, I've been I'm relatively new to it. I've only been, you know, two years or so, you know, in this space and in the industry, but like it's fascinating. I mean, it is so big and so fundamental to the economy. It is so important to consumers from a long-term perspective and yet there's so much opportunity to modernize it, transform it, improve on it. And so, um, yeah, these are all the things that are exciting to me.</p>

### Rocket Companies：从抵押贷款到住房所有权公司

主持人: 让我们深入了解Rocket Companies的历史和未来。嗯，也许从历史方面来看，如果我理解正确的话，经纪人模式曾经占据主导地位，然后转向了直接贷款，而Rocket Companies是其中一个主要的受益者。你能介绍一下这种模式是如何演变以及Rocket Companies的故事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get deeper into into into Rocket and and both go into its its history and and its and its future. Um maybe on on the history side if if I understand correctly the the broker model used to dominate and then there was a transition to direct lending and and Rocket was one of the you know big beneficiaries there. Why don't you give some of the of the history of how the model evolved and and the story of Rocket?</p>
</details>

Verun: 是的，我的意思是，Rocket Companies首先，你知道，已经存在很长时间了。你知道这家公司已经有40年的历史了，这是一个代际传承的事情。你知道我们已经存在很长时间了，并且我们一直在成长。你知道，我们是**底特律**（Detroit: 美国密歇根州最大城市，曾是汽车工业中心）最大的雇主之一，而且，你知道，我们从一开始就真正改变了抵押贷款体验。我认为我们是第一个将抵押贷款放到互联网上的公司。我们是第一个将它们放到手机上的公司。我们现在是第一个真正拥抱人工智能驱动的抵押贷款体验的公司。但是，你知道，很多时候，要大规模地构建这种体验是困难的。你知道，抵押贷款过程很复杂。我的意思是，你必须建立一种日常运作的定价、许可和**对冲**（hedging: 采取措施以减少未来价格波动风险的投资策略）基础设施。嗯，每个州、每个县都有不同的贷款要求、不同的监管要求，以及一整套不同类型的产品，对吗？**联邦住房管理局贷款**（FHA Loans: Federal Housing Administration Loans，由FHA担保的抵押贷款，通常对信用要求较低）、**退伍军人事务部贷款**（VA Loans: Department of Veterans Affairs Loans，由VA担保的抵押贷款，面向符合条件的退伍军人）、30年固定利率、可调整利率抵押贷款。嗯，合规要求会变化，你知道，有时是日复一日，周复一周。所以这是一个我们过去40年建立起来的庞大工作流引擎。嗯，你知道，我们在所有50个州、3000个教区都获得了许可。而且，你知道，我们有一种持续创新、持续演进的心态，嗯，我们擅长我们所做的事情。这就是为什么我们拥有最值得信赖的品牌，成为行业中最大的抵押贷款公司和贷款机构。但我也要说，我们，嗯，我们非常不安分。你知道，我们的价值观之一是“痴迷于寻找更好的方法”。这也驱动着我们成千上万的团队成员去做更多不安分、更具颠覆性的事情，并日复一日、周复一周、月复一月地持续改变这个领域。所以，我幸运地，你知道，成为了新任首席执行官。我担任这个职位已经两年了。我是公司历史上第一位外部首席执行官，但它是一家非常特别的公司。嗯，我们有巨大的潜力去做更多事情，我想说我们正在迅速从一家抵押贷款公司发展成为一家住房所有权公司，这意味着我们不仅在抵押贷款领域进行创新，而且真正地改变住房所有权，因为这才是真正的核心，你知道，它不仅仅是融资方面，它还涉及搜索和房地产方面，它涉及服务，它涉及真正对消费者做出30年的押注，而消费者也对我们做出30年的押注。所以我们的宏伟愿景是真正发展成为一家住房所有权公司。这就是为什么，你知道，我们围绕收购Redfin、**库珀先生公司**（Mr. Cooper: 美国一家大型抵押贷款服务商）所做的一些决定，对这一论点至关重要。但是我们，呃，我们在为消费者构建优秀产品和体验方面拥有悠久的传统。我们就是这样建立品牌的。我们就是这样建立我们的影响力的。嗯，我们有成千上万的团队成员对他们所做的事情充满热情。而且我们拥有一支非常忠诚的团队成员和人才基础。我们实际上举行了一次庆祝活动。去年我们公司成立40周年，我们举办了一场非常特别的活动，为我们的长期任职团队成员举行了庆祝。我们有超过500名团队成员在公司工作了20年以上。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean Rocket first off you know has been around for a long time. You know this company is is 40 years in the making and that's a that's a generational thing. You know we have we've been around for a long time and and we've grown. you know, we are uh one of the largest employers in Detroit and you know, we started by really transforming the mortgage experience from the beginning. I think we were the first to put uh mortgages on the internet. We were the first to put them on a mobile phone. We are now the first to really embrace the AIdriven version of the mortgage experience. But, you know, a lot of this is that it is hard to build this kind of a of an experience at scale. You know, the the mortgage process is complicated. I mean, you have to build sort of pricing, licensing, and hedging infrastructure that works on a day-to-day basis. Um, every state, every county has different lending requirements, different regulatory requirements, and a whole suite of different types of products, right? FHA, VA, 30-year fixed, adjustable rate mortgages. Um, the compliance requirements change, you know, sometimes day over day, week over week. And so it's a gigantic workflow engine that we've built over the past 40 years. Um, you know, we are licensed in all 50 states, 3,000 parishes. And, you know, we kind of have this mindset of continuous innovation, continuous evolution, and um, we're great at what we do. It's why we have the most trusted brand to become, you know, the largest mortgage company and lender in the industry. But I'd also say that we are um, we're very restless. You know, we have uh one of our values is obsessed with finding a better way. And that's something that drives thousands of our team members to just do uh more restless things, more disruptive things and continue to sort of transform the space day over day, week over week, month over month. So, I have the fortunate, you know, benefit of being um a new CEO. I've been in the role for two years. I'm the first outside CEO in the company's history, but it's a very special company. um so much potential for us to do more and I would say that we are quickly evolving from being a mortgage company to a home ownership company and that means that you know we're not just you know creating innovation in the mortgage space but we're really transforming home ownership because that's what's it's really about you know it's not just about the financing aspect um it's about the search and the real estate aspect it's about servicing it's about really making a 30-year bet on consumers who are making 30-year bets on us. And so our grand vision is to really evolve to be a home ownership company. That's why, you know, some of the decisions that we've made around acquiring Red Pin, Mr. Cooper, are fundamental to that thesis. But we uh we have a long legacy of of building great products and experiences for our consumers. That's how we built a brand. That's how we built our presence. Um we have thousands of team members that are super passionate about what they do. And we have a very loyal uh team member and talent base working for us. We actually had a celebration. We turned 40 this past year and we had a very special experience where we built um uh a celebration for our long-term tenure team members. And we had over 500 team members who've been with the company for over 20 years.</p>

<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

Verun: 这很酷。你知道，我，你知道，我在**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 美国加州北部的高科技产业区）待了一段时间。我在南加州和西雅图待过。你不会有很多公司拥有那种忠诚度。这是我们非常欣赏的，因为你们都知道，对吗？创新发生得很快，但要真正创造出特别的东西需要大量的奉献和热情。你必须投入大量时间。你有时必须花费，你知道，前两年是实验，弄清楚什么有效，什么无效。然后在第三年，你开始弄清楚，在第四年，你找到了更好的**产品市场契合度**（product market fit: 产品与目标市场高度匹配的状态）。在第五年，你弄清楚了分销。所以，嗯，我喜欢Rocket Companies的一点就是，我们有很多在这里工作了很长时间的人，他们会为这家公司赴汤蹈火。我认为这种忠诚和奉献，就是成就我们今天的原因。我们也正在押注它将使我们走向未来。

<p class="english-text">And that's pretty cool. You know, I you know, I've been in Silicon Valley for some time. I've been in Southern California and Seattle. And you don't have a lot of companies that have that kind of loyalty. And that's something that we really appreciate because you guys know this, right? It's innovation happens quickly, but it takes a lot of dedication and passion to actually create something special. You have to put a lot of time into it. You have to sometimes spend, you know, the first two years are experimentation realizing what works, what doesn't work. Then in your third year, you kind of figure out in your fourth year, you figure out better product market fit. In your fifth year, you figure out distribution. And so, um, what I love about Rocket is just that we have a lot of folks here who have been here a long time that will run through walls for this company. And that kind of loyalty and dedication, I think, is something that makes us, you know, what we are. And it's something that we're betting on will transform us into the future as well.</p>

主持人: 是的。Alex刚刚在**安德森·霍洛维茨**（Andreessen Horowitz: 知名风险投资公司，常简称为a16z）工作了10年，我在公司野餐时也同样受到启发，看到很多人在这里工作了

</details>

主持人: 是的，如果你在这里工作10年，你就能得到一块金表。所以，我得到了一块金表。它背面有漂亮的小刻字。嗯，但是如果我能补充一下你刚才说的，我的意思是，对此做一个精辟的总结，硅谷的很多公司，就像，“好的，我每天都使用这个产品，但公司却不知道如何赚钱，”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that that's the if if you're here for 10 years, you get a gold watch. So, I got a gold watch. It's it's it has little nice little engraving on the back. Um, but if if I could kind of add to to what you were saying for I mean like to to take like a a piffy take on this, a lot of companies in Silicon Valley, it's like, okay, I you I use this product every day and like the company can't figure out how to make money,</p>
</details>

Alex: 对吗？嗯，然后你有另一种公司，就像“我赚了很多钱”。我如何让人们每天都使用我的产品？不是因为我只是想要有人喜欢，而是我想要每天都增加价值，嗯，这就是我发现如此引人注目的地方，因为你知道这并不是我在安德森·霍洛维茨的日常工作的一部分，我投资了很多**房地产科技**（prop tech: Property Technology，利用技术改进房地产行业）公司和很多金融科技公司，嗯，我有一种课外活动，那就是Rocket Companies，我发现它如此有趣的部分原因在于，Rocket Companies在2021年实现了100亿美元的净收入，嗯，因为你猜怎么着，利率大幅下降了。人们会说：“我正在支付6%或5%的利率。我可以再融资到2.5%。我要那样做。我会省很多钱，而Rocket Companies正处于这一事件的中心。”但你不会每天都对抵押贷款进行再融资。你不会每天都买新房子。这些不是日常活跃使用的产品。与此同时，在硅谷，你有很多这类日常活跃使用的产品。他们会说：“我们怎么赚钱？我们不知道怎么赚钱。”就像我们有很多人使用像ChatGPT这样的产品。人们每天都使用它。他们赚钱了吗？没有。嗯，他们亏了很多钱。所以，找到这两种情况中更独特的一种是非常非常罕见的。它是指我有一个人们每天都使用的产品吗？嗯，它就像一把牙刷。记得**拉里·佩奇**（Larry Page: 谷歌联合创始人）在**谷歌**（Google: 跨国科技公司）有一个规则，那就是除非新产品通过了“牙刷测试”，否则我们不会推出。什么是牙刷测试？你必须每天使用它。希望你每天都刷牙。嗯，所以另一方面，有些公司就像它们没有通过牙刷测试。嗯，但这实际上并不是成功的条件，对吗？像那样100亿美元的净收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Um, and then you have this other type of company where it's like I make so much money. How do I get the person to use me every day? Not because it's like I just want somebody that like but it's like I want to add value every day and um this is what I found so compelling because I'm you know this is not part of my my day job at Andre and Horitz and I invest in a lot of prop tech companies a lot of fintech companies um and I have kind of an extracurricular activity which is which is Rocket and part of the reason why I find it so interesting is it's like this so Rocket made I think it was $10 billion in net income in 2021 um because guess what rates go down dramatically. People are like, "I'm paying 6% for my or 5%. I can refinance to 2 and a.5%. I'm going to do that. I'm going to save a lot of money and Rocket was at the epicenter of that." But you don't refinance your mortgage every day. You don't go buy a new house every day. These are not daily active use type products. And meanwhile, like in Silicon Valley, you have all of these daily active use type products. They're like, "How do we make money? We can't figure out how to make money." Like we get people that use this like chat GPT. People use it every day. Are they making money? No. Um, they're losing a lot of money. So, it's it's very very rare to find it's it's what what's the more unique of those two? Is it like I have a product that people use every single day? Um, it's like a toothbrush. Remember like Larry Page had a rule at Google which is like we will not launch new products unless they pass the toothbrush test. What's the toothbrush test? You have to use it every day. Hopefully, you you brush your teeth every day. Um, so whereas on the other hand, you have companies where it's like they don't pass the toothbrush test. Um, but that's actually not a qualification for success, right? $10 billion net income like that.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，你如何看待，我宁愿从这里开始，你知道，这是一个非常有价值的、真实的商业模式，你知道，运行完美，嗯，非常非常盈利。你如何增加更多产品和服务，为消费者增加更多价值？是的。

<p class="english-text">So, how do you take I I would rather start off with this, you know, here's a very very valuable thing that's a real business model, you know, perfectly run um very very profitable. How do you add more products and services that add more value to the consumer? Yeah.</p>
</details>

Alex: 对。就像你一年看两次牙医，就这样。这就像，有没有办法更定期地进行互动，这就是抵押贷款服务之类的东西发挥作用的地方，就像你每个月都会收到账单，那是一种互动，你如何处理它？大多数人，这实际上非常有趣，**托尼·谢**（Tony Hsieh: Zappos在线鞋店的CEO，以其独特的企业文化闻名）曾经讲过一个关于**Zappos**（美国一家在线鞋店，以其卓越的客户服务而闻名）的故事，Zappos是极少数决定将客户支持从成本中心转变为，嗯，我想他没有称之为利润中心。我想他称之为“爱心中心”之类的，但就是真正地与消费者互动。Zappos有一个著名的故事，说有一个女人，Zappos的客户支持代表给她送了花。她遇到了一些不好的事情。这就像你不会期望发生这种事。通常情况下，就像“好吧，我雇了**麦肯锡**（McKinsey & Company: 全球知名的管理咨询公司），他们说我可以这样那样裁掉三分之二的人，然后我可以把人放到这个**交互式语音应答**（IVR: Interactive Voice Response: 一种电话技术，允许计算机与人通过语音或按键互动）系统中，然后我每年可以节省400万美元。”很多公司就是这样对待“我给客户寄账单”或“我为客户提供客户支持”的，而不是将其视为推销商品的机会。不是以一种邪恶的方式，而是像，“嘿，我们每个月都和你沟通。”我们应该做什么？答案不能仅仅是我们要把成本降到零，让机器人做所有事情，然后你会讨厌我们。如果你每个月都与某人互动，并与他们一起做些什么，那真是一个有趣的机会。是的。嗯，所以这真的就像你从一个已经解决的利润中心开始，这是一个非常困难的问题，每天来到我们办公室的创业者都会说，“我最终会解决这个问题，但现在我有一个人们使用的产品，我有一把牙刷，但我不知道如何从中赚钱。”另一种做法，我认为这非常有趣，你知道，这是一家40年的公司。Verun在那里工作了两年。你有，你知道，一个真正的利润引擎。我们如何把它变成一把牙刷？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Right. It's like you go to the dentist twice a year, like that's it. That's just like is there a way to go interact on a more regular basis and and that's where things like mortgage servicing come in where it's like you get a bill every month that's an engagement what do you do with that most people it's actually really interesting there's a story that um uh Tony Shay used to say to to tell about Zapos where Zapos was one of the very very few companies that decided to take customer support and try to turn it from a cost center and actually turn it into a well I think he didn't call it a profit center. I think he called it like a love center or something, but like you know really engage the consumer. And there there was a famous story from Zapos where there was some woman and the customer support rep at Zapos sent her flowers. Something bad happened to her. It's just like you don't expect that to happen. Normally it's like okay I hired McKenzie and they said I could cut you know twothirds of my people this way and that way and then I could put people in this IVR and then I'll save $4 million a year. And like that's how a lot of companies treat their I'm sending a bill to a customer or I'm doing customer support with a customer as opposed to looking at it as an opportunity to upsell something. Not in like an evil way, but it's like, hey, we have a monthly communication with you. What is it that we should do? And the answer can't just be we're going to drive down the cost to zero and have robots do everything and you're going to hate us. It's like a real interesting opportunity if you're engaging somebody every month to do something with them. Yeah. Um, so it's really it's like you start off at the profit center that has been solved and that's a really hard problem that entrepreneurs that come into our office every day, it's like I'm going to figure that out eventually, but right now I have a product that people I've got a toothbrush, but I have no idea how to make money on it. The other way of doing this, and I think it's a really interesting, you know, it's a 40-year-old company. Verun's been there for for two years. You have, you know, a real profit engine. How do we turn it into a toothbrush?</p>

### Rocket Companies的整合与加速战略

主持人: 是的。那么，让我们谈谈你们是如何做到或考虑这样做的。你们进行了一系列高调的公开公司收购。嗯，你能不能谈谈这一切是如何结合在一起的战略，以及你们正在努力实现什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, let's talk about how how you guys are doing that or thinking about doing that. you you made a wave of acquisitions, you know, high-profile, you know, public companies. Um, why don't you talk about what what is sort of the strategy of how this all fits together, what you're trying to do?</p>
</details>

Verun: 是的。我的意思是，归根结底，我们希望从根本上重新定义这个类别本身，你知道，我们的论点非常简单。如果我们连接生态系统的更多部分，我们就能建立更好的体验。我们可以以更低的成本、更少的摩擦的形式将这种价值传递给客户，我们可以在业务周围建立根本不同的经济模式并推动增长。从我们的角度来看，你知道，当你想到漏斗时，抵押贷款在某种意义上是世界上最复杂的用户漏斗型产品之一，当我在**Intuit**（美国一家提供财务管理软件的公司）的**TurboTax**（美国知名的报税软件）工作时，TurboTax是另一个以漏斗为中心的产品例子，你知道，我们的策略非常简单。那就是我们希望在房屋所有权的整个旅程中为客户提供服务。不仅仅是融资和抵押贷款方面，还包括漏斗顶端的房屋搜索、房地产方面，以及底端的服务方面，在那里他们拥有终身关系。所以，呃，我们为此进行了两次收购。第一个是Redfin。Redfin是美国访问量最大的房地产经纪网站。他们拥有5000万月活跃用户的关系。所以这些是使用Redfin应用程序的消费者。他们使用Redfin网站，每天搜索房屋。嗯，我喜欢Redfin的一点是他们有一个很棒的移动应用程序。所以这5000万用户中的大多数，他们每天都在手机上使用这款产品。所以他们有那种非常好的丰富互动。他们还有一个由数千名房地产经纪人组成的网络，我们现在也雇佣他们，以及一个合作经纪人网络。所以这代表的实际上是房屋所有权体验的开始，对吗？所以有些人从抵押贷款和融资开始。其他人则从房子开始，比如浏览和那种窥探式的安排看房，对吗？探索房屋。所以这是我们想要连接的体验的一部分，对吗？所以这5000万个关系确实帮助我们建立了漏斗顶端的关系。我认为同样重要的下一件事是，我们希望将其与融资连接起来，然后将其连接到服务体验中。这之所以重要，是因为它使我们能够与客户建立更多关系，从而我们也可以为他们提供产品和服务。因为一旦你与Rocket Companies建立了关系，并且在房屋搜索、房地产、抵押贷款和服务方面都有很好的体验，它的美妙之处在于你创造了忠诚度。所以当那个客户准备进行下一次房屋所有权交易时，它不一定是一次新的购买，但也可以是，你知道，**房屋净值贷款**（home equity loan: 以房屋净值为抵押的一次性贷款），对吗？现在有数万亿美元的房屋净值被困在消费者的房屋中。所以，你知道，那里有很多净值你可以用来产生现金流。回到Alex之前的观点，他们今天在做什么？嗯，他们正在积累更多的信用卡债务，而相反，你知道，最好是从你的房子中提取更多的净值，还有什么比与你已经有关系的提供商这样做更好的方式呢，对吗？所以对我们来说，真正促成这些收购的重大认识是，这些关系是“超级漏斗”的一部分。它们不是单一的体验。如果我们能很好地整合体验的这些部分，我们就能与客户建立更好的关系。我们可以创造更多忠诚度。我们可以成为他们一生的贷款人。这就是基本论点。现在，呃，有了库珀先生公司和Rocket Companies，我们的服务簿中有1000万客户。所以这些是我们拥有终身关系的客户。这相当于美国六分之一的抵押贷款。所以这是巨大的规模，巨大的分销。而且你知道还有一句话说，你知道，首次创业者真正考虑的是产品市场契合度，而二次创业者真正开始关注的是分销，你知道，我们已经围绕再融资和购买创建了一个相当惊人的引擎，但问题是我们现在如何获得更多的分销，这实际上是这些收购背后的论点，嗯，就是我们现在可以获得更多的分销，然后我要说的最后一件事是，你知道，如果你相信世界正在转向这个人工智能世界，你知道，要使其成功，你需要的基本要素之一就是需要访问更多数据。这些数据允许你构建更好的模型。这些模型为你提供更好的体验，也让你更好地理解消费者行为，这只会让你构建更好的体验。所以这是一个相当简单的论点，只是连接了消费者旅程中自然存在的更多体验部分。这使得它更加无缝，对吗？更少的**数据录入点**（data entry points: 用户输入信息的环节），更少的等待和疑惑，更快的周转时间，更好的利率，更低的成本，更好的费用结构，以及在消费者关系生命周期中赢得忠诚度。所以，你知道，这些收购直接加速了我们的核心战略。嗯，我们对它们感到兴奋。你知道，现在还处于早期阶段。你知道，两笔大型上市公司交易。嗯，就公司整体规模而言，公司整体增长了大约60%。嗯，我们现在有了更多的全国性业务，你知道，我们在美国不同地区设有办事处，这带来了一个附带好处，就是我们能够吸引更多人才加入公司，嗯，并且能够以一种让我们更具创新性、成长和规模化的方式来建设我们的团队成员，呃，这有点像核心论点，那么说你们正在尽可能地进行垂直整合准确吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we want to redefine the category itself fundamentally, you know, and and our thesis is very simple. If we connect more parts of the ecosystem, we can build a better experience. we can pass on that value to the client in the form of lower lower cost less friction and we can build you know fundamentally different economics around the business and drive growth and from our perspective you know when you think about funnels right mortgage in some sense is one of the world's most complicated userfunnel type products and when I was at into a Turboax Turboax is another example of a funnel ccentric product and you know our strategy is is pretty simple. It's that we want to serve clients across the entire journey of home ownership. Not just the financing and mortgage aspect, but also at the top of the funnel, the home search, the real estate aspect, and then at the bottom end, the servicing aspect where you know they have a lifetime relationship. And so, uh, we've made two acquisitions in service to that. The first one is Redfin. Redfin is the most visited real estate brokerage site in the US. They have uh relationships with 50 million monthly active users. And so these are consumers that use the Redfin app. They use the Redfin website and they search for homes every single day. Um what I love about Redfin is they have an amazing mobile app. And so most of those 50 million users, they use the product daily and they use the product on a mobile phone. So they have that really nice rich interaction. They also have a network of thousands of real estate agents um that we now employ with the company as well as a partner agent network as well. And so what that represents is really the start of the home ownership experience, right? And so some people start with the mortgage and the financing. Other people start with the house and like browsing and sort of that voyeristic scheduling tours, right? Exploring the home. And so so that's one part of the experience that we want to connect, right? And so those 50 million relationships really help us build a top offunnel relationship. The the next thing that I think is also really important is that we want to connect that to financing and then we connect that into the servicing experience as well. And the reason that's important is because that allows us to build more relationships with clients so that we can reserve them with products and services as well. Because once you're in a relationship with Rocket and you have a great experience with home search, real estate, mortgage, and with servicing, the beautiful thing about it is that you create loyalty. And so when that client is ready for their next home ownership transaction, it doesn't have to be a new purchase, but could it could also be, you know, a home equity loan, right? There's trillions of dollars of home equity that is now trapped in in a consumer's home. And so, you know, there's a lot of equity there that you can use to generate cash flow. to Alex's earlier point, what are they doing today? Well, they're racking up more credit card debt and instead, you know, it's probably better to take more equity out of your home and what better way to do that with the provider that you already have a relationship with, right? And so for us, the big realization that really led to these acquisitions is that these relationships are part of a superfunnel. They're not a singular experience. And if we can do a good job integrating those parts of the experience, we can create a better relationship with clients. We can create more loyalty. We can be sort of their lender for life. And that's the fundamental thesis. Now, with uh with Mr. Cooper and Rocket, we have 10 million clients in our servicing book. And so those are clients that we have a lifetime relationship with. And that's one in six mortgages in the US. So it's massive scale, it's massive distribution. And you know there's another saying where you know first time founders you know really think about product market fit and second time founders really start to focus on distribution and you know we have created a pretty amazing engine around refinance around purchase but the question is how do we now get more distribution and that's really the thesis behind these acquisitions um is that we can now get more distribution and then the last thing I would say is you know if you believe that the world is shifting into this AI world you know one of the fundamental things that you need to to make that successful is you need access to more data. That data allows you to build better models. Those models give you better experience, but also better understanding of consumer behavior and that just allows you to build a better experience. And so it's a pretty simple thesis just connecting more parts of the experience that are naturally part of the consumer journey. It's making it more seamless, right? less points of data entry, less waiting and wondering, faster turn times, better rates, lower costs, better fee structures, and just earning loyalty over the lifetime of a consumer relationship. And so, you know, these acquisitions are direct accelerant of our core strategy. Um, and we're excited about them. You know, it's early days. You know, two big public company deals. Um, the overall company is growing by approximately 60% um in terms of just the overall size of the company. um we now have more national presence you know we have locations in different parts of the US that has a ancillary benefit of us being able to attract more talent to the company as well um and to be able to build our our team members um in a way that allows us to be more innovative and grow and scale and uh that's kind of the core thesis is is it accurate to say you're trying to vertically integrate as as much as possible?</p>

Verun: 是的，我认为有两件事，就像我认为，你知道，我在大规模**并购**（M&A: Mergers and Acquisitions，企业合并与收购）方面学到的一件事是，你必须非常刻意地决定何时整合以及何时加速，我将给你两个例子，因为我认为我们看待Redfin和库珀先生公司的方式在整合与加速方面略有不同。 “加速”这个词非常重要，因为我认为有时公司会犯错，当他们收购一家公司时，他们试图过快地同化它们，或者同化得不够快，而且他们没有刻意思考为什么要这样做。当你想到像Redfin这样的公司时，Redfin是一个非常成功的品牌，拥有非常成功的追随者和一群非常忠诚的消费者。我们讨论过的一件事是，嘿，Redfin品牌非常重要，对吗？消费者对那个品牌有很多亲和力。这是因为他们构建了一个很棒的产品。所以，当我们考虑Redfin和Rocket Companies的整合时，我们希望加强Redfin。我们不想过快地同化Redfin。我们想保留品牌。我们想加强品牌。我们希望增加对流量和需求生成的关注，投资于我们的房地产战略，因为这首先有助于我们建立漏斗顶端，其次，你知道，我们不希望Redfin品牌瓦解。你知道，我们不希望消费者失去那种亲和力。如果说有什么的话，我们想让它更强大。所以我们故意决定通过让Redfin更自主地运营来使其更强大。那是非常有意的。当你想到库珀先生公司时，最大的协同效应是那种抵押贷款发起业务与服务业务的整合，因为我们希望将这两者结合起来，以便我们能够重新获得并创造更多介于发起和服务之间的关系，而且库珀先生公司看起来更像Rocket Companies。你知道，他们有发起业务，他们有服务业务，所以对于那家公司，我们将进行品牌重塑。我们将把它全部称为Rocket平台。我们将更紧密地融合这些组织。所以这是一种在整合与加速方面更具目的性的方法。所以我们通过研究大量的模式和实践，分析了哪些因素使收购成功，哪些因素使其失败。我们希望对此非常刻意。但是，你知道，更直接地回答你的问题，整合是我们的首要重点。这是全公司的首要重点。嗯，我们有非常具体的目标。我们有非常具体的负责人。你知道，我们已经围绕它进行了组织。我们已经投资了围绕协同效应的具体里程碑，我们希望把这件事做好。我的意思是，这是我们公司正在进行的一项重大押注。我的意思是，这些收购价值数十亿美元，对我们的战略非常重要。你知道，库珀先生公司几乎是Rocket Companies规模的一半。你知道，Redfin的规模大约是库珀先生公司的一半。所以当你整体来看时，你知道，这是我们对Rocket Companies做出的相当大的补充。所以这对我、对我们的董事会、对我们的领导团队来说都是一个非常重要的优先事项。嗯，呃，顺便说一句，我也对人才感到兴奋。当你想到Rocket Companies的领导团队，呃，以及现在的组织时，我的意思是，我们拥有行业内许多最优秀、最聪明的人才。我们有那些，呃，非常精通抵押贷款和服务以及相关技术的人。我们还聘请了，你知道，我们有像Alex这样的领导者，他们现在是我们的董事会成员，真正代表了金融科技和整个科技领域的未来最先进水平。嗯，我们有一位新的首席营销官（CMO），我们有一位新的首席技术官（CTO），他们都来自行业，而不是抵押贷款领域。所以，我们有一个非常平衡的领导团队，我认为这些收购也将显著加强这一点。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there's two things like I think that you know one of the things that I've learned when it comes to large scale M&A is you want to be very intentional about when you are integrating and when you are accelerating and I'll give you two examples because I think the way we look at Redin and Mr. Cooper are a little bit different um around integration versus acceleration. And the word acceleration is really important because I think sometimes what companies get wrong is when they you know acquire a company, they try to assimilate them too quickly and or they try to assimilate them not quickly enough and they're not intentional about why they're doing what they're doing. And when you think about something like Redfin, it's like Redfin is a very successful brand that has a very successful following with a very loyal group of consumers. And one of the things we talked about was like, hey, the Red Fin brand is like super important, right? Consumers have a lot of affinity to that brand. It's because they build a great product. So, as we think about the integration of Red Fin and and Rocket, we wanted to strengthen Redf Fin. We did not want to assimilate Redfin too quickly. We wanted to preserve the brand. And we wanted to strengthen the brand. We wanted to increase the focus on traffic on demand generation to invest in the real estate strategy we have because one it it helps us build that top of funnel but two you know we don't want Red Fin brand to um disintegrate. You know we don't want consumers to lose that affinity. If anything we want to make it stronger. And so we have deliberately decided to make Redfin stronger by allowing it to operate a little bit more autonomously. And that's very intentional. When you think about Mr. Cooper, well, the biggest synergy is the integration of that kind of origination mortgage business and the servicing business because we want to bring those two things together so that we can recapture and create more relationships that kind of go between origination and servicing and Mr. Cooper looks a lot more like Rocket. You know, they have an origination business, they have a servicing business and so with that company, we are going to rebrand. We are going to call it all the rocket platform. We are going to fuse the organizations more closely together. And so that is a a much more intentional approach around integration versus acceleration. And so we've studied what has made acquisition successful and what's made them not successful by looking at a lot of patterns and practices. And we want to be very intentional about that. But you know to answer your question more directly, integration is our number one focus. It's the number one focus across the company. Um, we have very specific goals. We have very specific owners. You know, we've we've organized around it. We've invested in specific milestones around the synergies and we want to get this right. I mean, this is a big bet that we're making across the company. I mean, these acquisitions are billions and billions of dollars in value and they're very important to our strategy. You know, Mr. Cooper is almost half the size of Rocket. You know, Red Fin is, you know, about half the size of Mr. Cooper. And so when you look at it in totality, you know, it's it's quite a substantial addition to Rocket that we're making. And so it is a very important priority for me, for our board, for our leadership team. Um, and uh, I'm also excited, by the way, about just the talent. When you think about the Rocket leadership team, uh, as well as the organization now, I mean, we have many of the best and brightest in the industry. We have folks that, uh, are very steeped in mortgage and servicing and and in the technologies that are around it. We've also hired, you know, we've, you know, we have leaders like Alex that are now on our board that really represent the future state-of-the-art in fintech and in tech in general. Um, we have a new CMO, we have a new CTO who really come from industry, not mortgage. And so, we have a very balanced leadership team and I think these acquisitions are are going to strengthen that significantly as well.</p>

### 业务模型的平衡与傅里叶变换

主持人: Verun，我们在线下讨论过公司业务模式平衡的重要性。你能解释一下那是什么意思吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vroom, we were talking offline about the importance of of companies being uh balanced in their business model. Why don't you explain what that means?</p>
</details>

Verun: 是的。所以我认为公司有趣的一点是，尤其是在受监管的环境或对宏观经济动态敏感的环境中，它们的业务和盈利能力会波动，对吗？在像低利率环境这样的好时期，它们赚钱如印钞。在其他时候，你知道，它们往往会陷入困境。所以它们有点随风浮动。而我对我们公司真正感到兴奋的一点，特别是通过这些收购，就是我们现在达到了令人难以置信的**平衡**（counterbalanced: 指业务模型中不同部分能够相互抵消风险，保持稳定）。我们可以在任何市场、利率或经济周期中生存和发展。原因是我们的发起业务和服务业务相互平衡。所以，例如，当利率上升时，我们的服务组合的价值会持续增加，我们会在增加的服务簿上赚取经常性收入。但当利率下降时，我们可以发起更多的抵押贷款并进行再融资，为同一个服务簿创造新的机会。所以Rocket Companies的酷之处在于，它是住房行业中少数几家，甚至可以说是唯一一家超级平衡的公司。它有能力在任何市场或任何利率环境下生存、发展并扩大市场份额。我认为这非常令人兴奋，当你想到一家在数万亿美元产业中拥有个位数市场份额的公司，那里有很多整合，有很多机会真正用人工智能颠覆和改变体验，而将这些不同的资产整合在一起，使我们非常独特。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think one thing that is interesting about companies is that especially in regulated environments or environments that are sensitive to macroeconomic dynamics is that their business and profitability fluctuates, right? In in good times like low rate environments, they print money. In other times, you know, they sort of tend to struggle. And so they float a little bit with the wind. And one thing that I'm really excited about with our company, especially with these acquisitions, is that we are now incredibly counterbalanced. We can survive and thrive in any market, rate, or economic cycle. And the reason for that is our origination and our servicing business counterbalance each other. And so, for example, when rates rise, the value of our servicing portfolio uh continues to increase and we earn recurring revenue on an increased servicing book. But when rates fall, we can originate more mortgages and refinance and create new opportunities for that same servicing book. And so the cool thing about Rocket is it's one of the only companies, and I would argue the only company that is super counterbalanced in the housing industry. And it has the ability to survive, thrive, grow market share in sort of any market or any interest rate environment. And that's something that I think is tremendously exciting when you think about a company that is in a multi-t trillion dollar industry that has singledigit market share where there's a lot of consolidation, a lot of opportunity to really disrupt and transform experiences with artificial intelligence and just having these different assets sort of put together in the same place makes us very unique.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我本来想说，呃，数学中有一个概念叫做**傅里叶变换**（Fourier transform: 一种数学工具，将函数分解成不同频率的正弦和余弦波）。嗯，呃，基本上它就是，如果你有任何函数，如果你有一条线，就像每个企业的收入和利润都应该像这样，对吗？如果你看起来像这样，每个人都高兴；如果你看起来像这样，每个人都不高兴；如果你看起来像这样，人们可能不高兴，但实际上并没有错。而傅里叶变换基本上就是你可以将任何函数分解成一堆正弦曲线，对吗？所以如果我有一条像这样的线，它实际上可能由50个像这样的东西组成，但正如Verun所说，它们相互平衡，而创业者常犯的一个大错误就是，“我有一个像正弦曲线一样的业务。”让我们把它扼杀掉。我不喜欢那个业务。不，不，不，不。它实际上很棒，就像大多数业务在某种程度上都是周期性的，即使你没有那样想。就像再添加一个周期略有不同的正弦曲线。所以它只是相互平衡，就像如果你，银行实际上已经做到了，像**摩根大通**（JPMorgan: 知名跨国金融服务公司）是世界上最有价值的银行，他们已经做到了这一点，因为他们有一堆正弦曲线，对吗？就像他们是否应该放弃他们的投资银行业务，即使在2022年投资银行业务没有盈利，不，但他们有时会赚很多钱，这就像一种丰收或饥荒的情况，但让我们增加财富管理，因为我们每年从一万亿美元中获得50个基点，让我们增加，嗯，你知道，零售，让我们增加，他们有这么多不同的产品线。原因是它们都像，你知道，如果你有一个像这样的曲线，然后你有一个完全相反的曲线。你把这个和那个结合起来，然后你得到一条直线，你想要直线因为它们是可预测的，但你的业务在表面之下通常不是一条直线。它是由傅里叶变换组成的。以这种方式拥有这些重叠的正弦曲线，你实际上确实希望得到一条单调递增的直线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was going to say uh so there's a concept in math it's called the furier transform. Um and uh basically what that is is like if you have any function if you have a line like every business their revenue and their profit should look like this right if you look like this everybody's happy you look like this everybody's not happy if you look like this people are like probably not happy but actually there's nothing wrong and what a for transform is is basically you can decompose any function into a bunch of sign curves right so if I have a line that looks like this it actually might be composed of 50 things that look like this but to Verun's point they kind of counterbalance and a big mistake that entrepreneurs often make is like I have a business that is a sign curve. Let's kill it. I don't like that business. No, no, no, no. It's actually a great like most businesses are in some way, shape or form cyclical even if you don't think of it that way. Like just add another sign curve that has like a slightly different period. So it just counterbalances like if you're and the banks actually have done it like JP Morgan is the most valuable bank in the world and they have done this because they have a bunch of sign curves right it's like should they get rid of their investment banking business even though in like 2022 the investment banking business was not profitable no but they're going to make a lot of money sometimes it's like a feast or famine type thing but let's add wealth management because we get 50 basis points on a trillion dollars every single year let's add um you know retail, let's add like they have so many different product lines. And the reason why is because they all are like you know if you have a curve that looks like this and then you have the exact opposite curve. You combine this with that and then you get a straight line and you want to have straight lines because they're predictable but your business actually under the covers typically is not a straight line. It's it's composed it's a f it's like a fier transform. have these these um overlapping sign curves in such a way where you actually do get hopefully a monotonically increasing straight line.</p>

### 房地产市场的复杂性与变现挑战

主持人: 好的。你之前谈到过，有些公司就像印钞机，而硅谷的初创公司，你知道，通过了“牙刷测试”，但却没有附带印钞机。你知道，Rocket Companies已经能够通过Redfin等公司获得一种需求机器。在房地产领域，如果你拥有人们每天都在搜索的平台，为什么很难在其旁边建立一个印钞机呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. You were talking about earlier how there are kind of money printing machines and um you know Silicon Valley startups that have you know toothbrush tests but don't have a money printing machine attached to it. You know uh Rocket has been able to acquire a sort of demand machine you know in in in Redfin and others. Why is it so hard in real estate if you own sort of the place where people are searching every day to build the the money printing a machine ne next to it?</p>
</details>

Alex: 嗯，有太多的延迟。我的意思是，我认为Zillow就是一个很好的例子。就像Zillow，很多人使用Zillow。嗯，它实际上并没有赚那么多钱，因为它就像是为经纪人生成潜在客户的机器。他们就是这样赚钱的。呃，他们绝大多数收入来自你进行搜索。你为什么要搜索？你甚至没有带着购买意图进行搜索。就像谷歌赚了很多钱。我们在很多播客中都谈论过谷歌，对吗？所以谷歌赚了很多钱，它是一个高级模型，99%的时间你都在搜索如何杀死这只在我们壶边嗡嗡叫的烦人苍蝇，然后1%的时间你才想去买一个苍蝇拍，那才是购买意图，而且我们的工作室里确实有只苍蝇。Verun，我在这里指的是那个。所以呃，你知道，1%的时间有购买意图。嗯，然而如果我，有些人，你知道“**Netflix**（全球流媒体服务平台）和放松”这个词，对吗？有些人就是这样看房子的。就像“哦，我要整晚看那些我买不起的、在一个我永远不会去的世界奇怪角落的房子。”人们为什么这样做？我不知道。就像这很有趣。就像人们喜欢它，这有点像一种向往。我喜欢看房子。哦，就像我听说，你知道，呃，**谢丽尔·桑德伯格**（Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook前首席运营官）卖了房子，让我看看那栋房子，或者我听说，你知道，**莎朗·斯通**（Sharon Stone: 美国著名女演员）这样，或者我听说，你知道，**连姆·尼森**（Liam Neeson: 爱尔兰著名男演员）那样。就像你不会买连姆·尼森的房子，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there's so much latency. I mean, like I think of Zillow's a good example of this. Like Zillow, a lot of people use Zillow. Um, it actually doesn't make that much money because it's like it's a lead generation machine for agents. That's how they make money. U, the vast majority of their revenue comes from like you do a search. Why are you doing a search? You're not even doing a search with purchase intent. Like Google makes a lot. We've talked about Google a lot in many podcasts, right? Like so Google makes lots of money and it's a premium model where it's like 99% of the time you're searching for like how do I kill this annoying fly that keeps like buzzing around our our pot like and then 1% of the time it's like I want to go buy a fly swatter and that's purchase intent and then there is a fly in our studio. Verun, that's what I'm referencing here. So uh you know 1% of the time there's there's purchase intent. Um whereas if I'm there are people um you know you know the term Netflix and chill, right? There are people that have done this with like looking for homes. It's like oh I'm going to spend all night looking at homes that I cannot afford in a weird part of the world that I'm never going to even visit. Why do people do that? I don't know. Like it's fun. Like people like it's it's kind of like this aspirational. I like looking at homes. Oh, like I heard that, you know, uh, Cheryl Sandberg sold like let me look let me look at that house or I heard that uh, you know, Sharon Stone this or I heard that, you know, Liam Niss that. Like you're not going to buy Liam Niss's house,</p>
</details>

主持人: 但你仍然好奇。你会去看它。购买意图往往很低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you're still curious. You go look at it. The purchase intent tends to be low.</p>
</details>

Alex: 所以你会有这样的人，就像有些搜索引擎与交易非常非常紧密地耦合，而房地产并非总是如此，原因有二。第一是它有娱乐价值。嗯，然后第二，有很多延迟。就像我刚搬到圣克拉拉时，我还是个小租客，买不起帕洛阿尔托的房子，但我一直在看房子。嗯，我一直都在看房子。那实际上是有购买意图的，但只是有几年的延迟，你知道，与谷歌不同，你不是那样使用谷歌的。就像“我想买一个苍蝇拍”。我输入“苍蝇拍”，然后看到50个搜索链接弹出来。我点击其中一个，然后购买，也许我明天就会买，但它与购买意图的近期关联性要强得多。所以这就是为什么你有一个**日活跃用户**（DAU: Daily Active Users: 衡量产品用户活跃度的指标）产品，但这并不一定意味着你只需安装一个变现引擎就能让它运作。特别是当变现引擎，这几乎低估了构建变现引擎的难度，就像你知道抵押贷款，我不得不在天知道多少个州进行指纹识别，比如我们正在进行库珀先生公司的交易，我不得不向弗吉尼亚州发送墨水指纹，以及我所有银行账户的信息。啊，这太复杂了，我的意思是，我希望不是这样，但事实证明，添加和安装变现引擎非常非常复杂。嗯，顺便说一句，构建这些日常活跃使用的产品非常困难，但因为你在房地产领域有更多的窥探欲，所以它不一定像我与购买意图有非常非常近期的关联，然后就像为什么Zillow没有这样做？你知道为什么吗？我告诉你为什么。这真的非常非常困难，而且他们沉迷于目前向经纪人销售潜在客户的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have people like it's kind of like there are some search engines that are very very tightly coupled to transaction and real estate is not always that way for two reasons. Number one is that there is this entertainment value to it. Um, and then number two, there's just a lot of latency. Like I was looking at homes when I couldn't when I was just a a little little renter in Santa Clara, uh, having just moved here, I couldn't afford a house in Palo Alto. Um, and I would look at homes all the time. And that was actually like there was purchase intent, but just with like years of latency, you know, versus like Google, you don't that's not how you use Google. Like it's like I want to buy a fly swatter. I type in fly swatter and then I see 50 like search links pop up. I click on one of those and then I buy and maybe I'll buy tomorrow, but there's just much more near-term proximity to that. So that's that's part of the reason why like you've got a DAU product and that does not necessarily mean you just bolt on a monetization engine and then you get it to work. Particularly where the monetization engine, it's like that almost like undersells how hard it is to build a monetization engine like you know mortgage I've had to get like fingerprinted in god knows how many states like you know we're doing this Mr. Cooper deal and I had to send like you know ink fingerprints to the state of Virginia like every single bank account I've ever had. Ah it's just so complic I mean I wish it weren't that way but it turns out it's very very complicated to add on and bolt on the monetization engine. Um and it's by the way it's very hard to build one of these you know daily active use products but because you have a little bit more voyerism in the field of real estate it's not necessarily like I have very very near-term proximity to purchase intent and then like why hasn't Zillow done this? You know why? I'll tell you why. It's really really hard and they're addicted to the current business model of selling leads to agents.</p>
</details>

Verun: 是的。我只想补充一点，在住房领域取得成功并非易事。就像我只是不期望一家车库里的早期公司能够部署。需要巨大的**激活能**（activation energy: 在此指启动一个项目或系统所需的初始投入和努力）。监管因州而异。产品是碎片化的。分销是超本地化的。而且你知道，你有周期性，交易量随利率波动。贷款机构必须扩大和缩小规模。你知道，金融危机后有银行介入。你有二级市场，有发起人、聚合商和服务商。你有一堆遗留流程、手动文档、评估。嗯，然后你还有各种其他事情，对吗？你有雇主需要核实收入。你有银行需要确认你的资产。你有保险公司、评估师、产权公司，所以每个人都使用不同的时间表和系统。所以它只是摩擦和碎片化，其中一部分就是决定这样做所需的激活能，这绝不是胆小者能做到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I would just add that winning in housing is not for the faint of heart. Like I just don't expect that an early stage company in a garage is going to be able to deploy. There's just such an activation energy that's required. The regulations vary by state. Products are fragmented. The distribution is hyper local. And you know you have the cyclicality where the volume swing with rates. the lenders have to scale up and scale back. You know, you have banks stepping in after the financial crisis. You have the secondary market with like originators and aggregators and services. You have a bunch of legacy processes, manual docs, appraisals. Um, and then like you also just have all kinds of other things, right? You have like employers that have to verify income. You have banks that have to confirm your assets. You have insurers, appraisers, title companies, and so like everyone uses different timelines and systems. So it's it's just friction and fragmentation and like part of it is just the amount of activation energy that's required to decide to do that is just not for the faint of heart</p>
</details>

Alex: 这就是我喜欢我们所做的事情之一，我们决定克服这种激活能，你猜怎么着，我们花了40年，对吗？所以这有点像，你知道为什么信用卡网络在市场中拥有如此主导的地位，就像那些大公司，**维萨**（Visa: 全球支付技术公司）、**万事达卡**（Mastercard: 全球支付技术公司），你知道，**美国运通**（American Express: 知名金融服务公司），为什么有很多新银行正在创建新的信用卡，但它们却没有占据显著的市场份额。简单的答案是，他们花了很长时间。这不是那种突然出现病毒式传播和网络效应，然后这些东西就突然增长的情况。有些事情只是一个简单的事实，你知道，容易的路是长路，而长路是艰难的路。没有什么捷径。所以我认为这给了我们一点先发优势。我们不会认为这是理所当然的，但严重的碎片化、分散的技术和系统、以及不同参与者之间的激励模式都相互矛盾。我们认为这是一个好问题，因为我们已经克服了部分激活能。现在你拥有技术和人工智能，你拥有自动化，你能够压缩周转时间，降低固定成本，连接不同的部分，并构建一个更加互联的旅程。但这就像，你知道，我认为这是一个好问题，但也是一个，你知道，鉴于我们已经克服了这种激活能，我们有机会做得更多的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is one of the things that I love about what we do is that we have decided to overcome that activation energy and guess what it took us 40 years right and so it's sort of like you know why is there why is it that like credit card networks have such a dominant presence in the in the market like the big ones right the Visas the Mastercards you know, the AMXs and and why is it that you have a bunch of neo banks that are creating new credit cards, but but they're not taking significant share. And like the simple answer is it took them a long long time. Like it wasn't like something that just happened where there was this verality and and network effect where suddenly these things grow. Some of the things are just the simple fact that you know the easy way is the long way and the long way is the hard way. There is no sort of easy way. And so that's something that I think gives us a little bit of a first mover advantage. It's not something that we take for granted, but just the the amount of serious fragmentation, the amount of disperate technology and systems, the incentive models around the different players are all at odds with each other. And we look at that as a good problem because we've overcome some of that activation energy. Now you have technology and AI, you have automation, you have the ability to compress turn times, lower fixed cost, connect the different pieces of it and just build a more connected journey. But that's like, you know, where I think it's a good problem to have, but it's also one that, you know, we have an opportunity to do significantly more just given we've overcome that activation.</p>
