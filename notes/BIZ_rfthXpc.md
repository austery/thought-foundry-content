### 现代爱情：寻找最浪漫的瞬间

**Anna**: 大家好，我是 **Anna**。在节目开始前，我想聊聊**情人节**，因为在《**现代爱情**》（Modern Love）栏目组，我们已经在考虑这件事了。我们希望大家能帮个忙：我们想知道发生在你身上最浪漫的事。或者，如果没发生在你身上，那是你见过或见证过最浪漫的事。它可以是宏大的，像浪漫喜剧那样的举动——也许有人拿着录音机站在你窗外，或者跑过机场阻止你离开。也可以是微小的事，比如某人知道你讨厌橄榄，所以在你动筷子前总是把它们从你盘子里挑出来。或者有人每天早上在你的午餐盒里塞张纸条，提醒你你对他有多重要。无论是大时刻还是微小时刻，只要让你感受到浪漫的冲击，我们都想听听，并想知道为什么它对你来说如此浪漫。如果你有故事，请录一段语音备忘录，在 2 月 4 日前发邮件到 modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com，我们可能会在节目中使用你的故事。截止日期是 2 月 4 日。非常感谢，期待听到你们的故事。现在，开始今天的节目。

**Anna**: Hey everyone, it's Anna. All right, before we start the show, I want to talk about Valentine's Day because of course we are already thinking about it over here at Modern Love. We're hoping you can help us out. We want to know the most romantic thing that's ever happened to you. Or if it didn't happen to you, the most romantic thing you've ever seen or witnessed. It could be something grand, a romcom style gesture. Maybe someone stood outside your window with a boom box or ran through the airport to stop you from leaving. Or it could be something small like someone knows you hate olives, so they always pick them off your plate before you dig in. Or someone slips a note in your lunchbox every morning to remind you how much you mean to them. Whatever made you feel that rush of romance from the big moments to the tiny ones, we want to hear about it and we want to know why it was so romantic to you. If you have a story in mind, record a voice memo and email it to us at modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com by February 4th and we might use your story on the show. That's modern love podcast times.com. And once again, your deadline is February 4th. Thanks so much. We can't wait to hear from you. Now, here's today's episode.

### 完美生活的假象

**Anna**: 我是 **Anna Martin**。这是《现代爱情》。**Belle Burden** 曾过着许多人梦寐以求的生活，简直完美如画。她和丈夫非常富有，我说的是那种**老钱**阶层的富有，曼哈顿社会的精英。他们有三个孩子，Belle 专注于抚养孩子，而她的丈夫在一家**对冲基金**工作。她以为他们是一个幸福的家庭。然而，在结婚 20 年后，没有任何预兆，她的丈夫告诉她他想要离婚，并且要立即离开。在短短一天内，她的丈夫对她来说基本变成了个陌生人。当 Belle 试图理解发生了什么时，她做了一个让身边许多人感到惊讶的决定：她向世界分享了她的故事。首先是一篇在网上疯传的《现代爱情》专栏文章，现在她更进一步，写了一本书，书名就叫《**陌生人：婚姻回忆录**》（Strangers: A Memoir of Marriage）。今天，我和 Belle 聊聊，尽管那个夜晚感觉像是一个恐怖而突然的终结，但它实际上是她新生活的开始。Belle Burden，欢迎来到《现代爱情》。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. Belle Burden was living a life a lot of people dream of. Picture perfect. She and her husband were rich. And I'm talking old money rich. The elite of Manhattan society. They had three kids who Belle was focused on raising while her husband worked at a hedge fund. She thought they were a happy family. Then 20 years into her marriage, with no warning, her husband told her he wanted a divorce and he was leaving immediately. In a single day, her husband basically became a stranger to her. As Belle tried to understand what happened, she made a decision that surprised a lot of the people close to her. She shared her story with the world. First in a modern love essay that went viral and now she's gone even further and written a book. It's called Strangers, a memoir of marriage. Today I talk with Belle about how even though that night felt like a horrible and abrupt ending, it was actually the beginning of her new life. Belle Burden, welcome to Modern Love.

</details>

**Belle**: 非常感谢你邀请我，我很高兴能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Thank you so much for having me. I'm thrilled to be here.

</details>

**Anna**: 我们也很高兴你能来。好的，我叫你 Belle。但你的全名是 **Flobell**，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: We are thrilled to have you. Okay. I'm calling you Belle. But your full name is Flobell. Correct.

</details>

**Belle**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: It is.

</details>

**Anna**: 这个名字背后有什么故事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: What is the story behind that name?

</details>

**Belle**: 我祖母的名字叫 **Florence Bell Fairbanks**，她是加州的一名**默片演员**。她给自己起了个艺名叫 Flobell。她在我出生前四个月去世了。我父亲在她的葬礼上致悼词，最后说：“如果 Amanda（我母亲）在五月生个女孩，她的名字就叫 Flobell Fairbanks Burden。” 大家都哭了。问题是，他还没把这件事告诉我母亲。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: So, my grandmother's name was Florence Bell Fairbanks and she was an actress in silent films in California and she made up Flobell as her stage name. And then she died four months before I was born. And my father stood up at her funeral and gave the eulogy and ended it by saying, "If Amanda, my mother, has a girl in May, her name will be Flobell Fairbanks Burden." And everyone cried. The problem was that he had not told my mother that. [laughter]

</details>

**Anna**: 所以她妈妈坐在前排，心想：“哇……”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: So her mom's in the front row like, "Wow..."

</details>

**Belle**: 她很不高兴。她真的很不高兴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: She was not happy. She was really not happy.

</details>

**Anna**: 好的。默片演员，这听起来非常时髦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Okay. A silent film actress. That's very chic, though.

</details>

**Belle**: 确实很酷。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: It was cool. Yeah.

</details>

### 那个改变一切的夜晚

**Anna**: 我想从名字转到另一个话题。早在 2023 年，你写了一篇《现代爱情》的文章，它让我震惊得停下了脚步。我无法停止思考它。现在你写了一本书，这让我们了解了更多你的故事。在书中，你谈到在一个夜晚，你的婚姻毫无征兆地崩塌了，你的生活永远改变了。这发生在 2020 年 3 月。你写道，你和家人离开曼哈顿，去了位于**马萨葡萄园岛**（Martha's Vineyard）的家。在疫情初期，你们在那里隔离。带我回到你生活的那段时光。当你们安顿下来时，那里的生活是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Okay. I want to pivot from the name just to say back in 2023, you wrote a modern love essay and it stopped me in my tracks. I could not stop thinking about it. Now, you've written a book which we're here to talk about today. This gives us even more of your story. In it, you talk about how one night out of the blue, your marriage collapsed and your life changed forever. This happened in March 2020. You wrote that your family, you and your family left Manhattan for your home in Martha's Vineyard. You're quarantining there during the early days of COVID. Bring me into sort of that time in your life. What was life like there as you settled in?

</details>

**Belle**: 我们带着当时 15 岁和 12 岁的两个女儿开车去了那里，对我们所有人来说，那是一个非常可怕的时期。纽约停摆了。但我们很幸运，有一个我们热爱的、与世隔绝的地方可以去，我们真的安顿了下来。我丈夫在一家对冲基金工作，所以他起得很早去工作，我负责打扫卫生和散步。他喜欢在森林里劈柴，他会带回蓝莓木、橡木等三种不同的木头，生起华丽的篝火。他买了很多**威士忌**，因为我们当时觉得威士忌能杀死病毒，所以他会做威士忌酸酒，有时是热托地（hot toddy）。我们会坐在那里阅读，或者讨论最新的疫情新闻。除了劈柴，他还很喜欢做晚饭。他非常努力地确保我们在这个隔离期是安全且准备充分的。所以那既是一个可怕的时期，但也让我感到非常安全，女儿们一直待在家里，大家聚在一起非常温馨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: So, we drove up there with our two daughters who were then 15 and 12 and it was a very scary time for all of us. New York was shut down. But we were very lucky that we had a place to go to that was isolated that we loved and we really settled in. My husband works for a hedge fund, so he was getting up early and working and I was doing house cleaning and going for walks and he'd love to be in the forest chopping wood and he would bring in three different kinds like blueberry and oak and he would build these gorgeous fires. He had bought a lot of whiskey because we thought whiskey would kill the virus and so he made whiskey sours or sometimes like a hot toddy and we would sit there and we would read or we would talk about the latest pandemic news and he was very in addition to chopping the wood he he loved to make dinner. He loved to really kind of make sure that we were secure and ready for this period of quarantine. And so it was both a scary time but also very um I felt very safe with my girls in the house all the time and and just that kind of coziness together.

</details>

**Anna**: 你丈夫有什么反常的地方吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Did anything did anything seem off with your husband?

</details>

**Belle**: 说实话，完全没有。如果回想起来，他花了很多时间在森林里，但这并不反常，他一直都那样。我们彼此非常亲热。绝对没有任何让我担心的事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Nothing seemed off at all honestly. If he um if I think back on it he was he spent a lot of time in the woods and but that was not abnormal. He always did that. We were very affectionate with each other. There was absolutely nothing that made me worried.

</details>

**Anna**: 到那时为止，你们已经结婚多少年了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And you've been married at this point for now how many years in...

</details>

**Belle**: 20 年。2020 年正好是 20 年。（叹气）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: 20 years. 20 years in 2020. [sighs]

</details>

**Anna**: 这就是你那篇《现代爱情》文章开始的地方。带我进入那个一切都改变了的夜晚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: This is this is where your modern love essay begins. Bring me into this night where everything changed.

</details>

**Belle**: 我们吃了一顿非常愉快的晚餐。我开始收拾，装洗碗机，拖地。这时我的手机响了，然后显示有一条留言，我按了播放。是一个男人的声音，他说：“我想找 Belle。” 我现在还能听到那个声音。“我想找 Belle。我很遗憾地告诉你，你丈夫和我妻子有染。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: We had a really nice dinner. And I started cleaning up, loading the dishwasher, mopping the floor, and I got a call on my cell phone and then it registered the message and I pressed play and it was a man and he said, "I'm trying to reach Belle." I can still hear it. I'm trying to reach Belle. I'm sorry to tell you that your husband is having an affair with my wife.

</details>

**Anna**: 你的第一反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: What was your immediate reaction?

</details>

**Belle**: 我立刻觉得这不可能是真的，这不可能是真的。我觉得我丈夫会解释清楚，这肯定是什么误会，某种误解。这和我认识的丈夫完全对不上。我当时穿着睡裤和舒适的毛衣，刚洗完澡，我仍然能感受到那种温馨感与恐慌交织的感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: My immediate feeling was that this could not be true this can't be true and that my husband would explain it that it was some kind of mistake, some kind of misunderstanding. It did not fit at all with what I knew of my husband. I was wearing pajama pants and like a cozy sweater and I'd just taken a shower and I I can still feel that feeling of sort of the coziness with the just panic.

</details>

**Anna**: 你收到了那条语音留言。然后发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: You get that voicemail. Then what happens?

</details>

**Belle**: 我们的厨房在楼上。所以我开始下楼去找我丈夫，而他正走上楼来。我能看出来他已经知道了，因为他看起来很焦虑。他说这毫无意义。非常简短。“我爱你。我只爱你。我爱我们的家庭。我很抱歉。我很尴尬。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: I go our kitchen is upstairs. So, I started going downstairs to find my husband and he was coming upstairs and um I could tell that he knew cuz he looked worried. And he said it meant nothing. It was very short. I love you. I love only you. I love our family. I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

</details>

**Anna**: 你们当时在哪？是握着手，还是坐着？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: What are you Where are you two? Are you holding hands? Are you sitting on?

</details>

**Belle**: 是的。他握着我的手，直视着我的眼睛。我记得低头看着我们的手，他戴着他的结婚戒指，那是戴了 20 年后磨损得很厉害的戒指。而我没戴任何戒指，因为一个朋友告诉我，病毒可能会藏在戒指下面，因为你没法把肥皂和洗手液弄进去。所以我把它们都摘了。当我坐在那里，他握着我的手时，我在想，天哪，是不是因为我 20 年来第一次摘下结婚戒指才导致了这一切？我是一个从不摘下结婚戒指和订婚戒指的人。我觉得也许我动摇了宇宙中的某种东西，导致了这一刻。我是说，这不理智，但我当时就是这么想的。但我也在想，好吧，我们一起住在这房子里。我们哪儿也去不了，我们在封锁中。我们必须住在一起，努力解决这个问题，在 Zoom 上看心理医生，想想我该如何应对？就在那时，我 12 岁的小女儿叫我，让我给她做**翻转馅饼**（turnovers），那是我们家的传统。我不是从头开始做的，是 Pepperidge Farm 的冷冻馅饼。我意识到我必须在孩子们面前假装一切正常，直到我们弄清楚发生了什么以及我们要怎么做。所以我提高嗓门，听起来很轻快地说：“好的，我去做馅饼。” 然后我离开了房间，把馅饼放进烤箱，然后走进浴室，把自己锁在里面，放声大哭。我再也控制不住了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: We are. Um, he's taken my hands. He's looking directly in my eye. And I remember looking down at our hands and he had his wedding ring on that's very scuffed from wearing it for 20 years. And I had no rings on because a friend had told me that COVID could hide under rings, right? Because you can't get soap and Purell in there. So, I had taken them all off and as I'm sitting there with him holding my hands, I think, wow, did I did I cause this because I took off my wedding ring for the first time in 20 years. I was someone who never took off my wedding ring and my engagement ring. And I thought maybe I had shaken something loose in the universe and that this had led to this moment. I mean, not thinking rationally, but that's that's where I was. But I think I also thought, okay, we're in this house together. We can't go anywhere. we're in lockdown. We are going to have to live here together and try and work through this and see a therapist on Zoom and you know just how am I going to manage this? Um and then at that moment my younger daughter who was 12 called for me and asked me to make her turnovers which is a thing that we have in our family. I do not make them from scratch. They're Pepperidge Farm frozen turnovers. Um, and I realize I have to pretend that everything is okay for the girls until we can figure out what's happening and what we're doing. And so I sort of raised my voice to sound chipper and said, "Okay, I'll I'll make the turnovers." And I left the room at that point and put the turnovers in the oven and then went to my shower and just where I could seal myself in and closed the bathroom door and just wailed. Um where it just I was like I just couldn't contain it any longer.

</details>

### 骤然的告别与决绝

**Anna**: 那个夜晚是怎么结束的？你能睡着吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And then how does the night I mean does it like how does the night end? Do you can you even sleep? I mean...

</details>

**Belle**: 我睡不着。我下楼去看孩子们，因为我还没安顿小女儿睡觉。她们都在床上睡着了，我丈夫睡在我儿子的床上（我儿子当时和朋友在长岛）。他看起来睡得很安稳。我当时在想，他怎么睡得着？他怎么能不处于痛苦的状态？我整晚没睡。我们的婚姻要么将经历一段非常艰难的时期，要么可能结束，而他却在睡觉，我完全无法理解。但早上 6 点，我躺在床上没睡着，他走了进来，提着一个手提袋，对我说：“我以为我很幸福，但我并不幸福。我决定离婚。” 我惊呆了，因为我真的以为是否维持婚姻或如何协商将由我来决定。但这不再是我的决定了，而是他的决定。我看着他，那一刻他看起来非常不同。他的眼神变了，温暖消失了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: I can't sleep. I go downstairs to check on the girls cuz I had not put the younger one to bed. Um, and they're both asleep in their beds and my husband is asleep in my son's bed. Um, my son is with friends on Long Island and he looks very peaceful and I'm sort of... Your husband... Yes. Sleeping peacefully. And I'm thinking, how how can he be sleeping? How can he be not just in a state of distress? Yeah. I haven't slept all night. I mean, our marriage is either, you know, going to go through a very difficult period or it might end. and he's sleeping and I can't quite understand that. But at 6:00 in the morning, I'm in my bed, not sleeping, and he comes in and he's carrying a tote bag and he says to me, "I thought I was happy, but I'm not. I've decided I want a divorce." And I was stunned because I honestly thought it would be my decision to make whether we would stay married or not or how we would negotiate this. Um but it was not going to be my decision. It was going to be his decision. And I looked at him and in that moment he seemed very very different to me. His eyes looked different. The warmth had gone.

</details>

**Anna**: 哇。从昨晚说的“这是一个错误，我爱你”，到现在他说了什么？他说他不开心，要离婚，而且他要走了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Wow. from from the words he said last night which is this was a mistake you know I love you and now what did he say he says I haven't been happy and I want a divorce and I'm leaving...

</details>

**Belle**: 他要走了。包已经收拾好了。他说你会没事的，你还年轻。老实说，我不年轻了，我刚满 50 岁。他走出房间，走向前门，走出去，上了他的吉普车，上了渡轮离开了。还有一件事我没提到，他在离开前说，或者说是他到纽约后说的，他说：“你可以拥有孩子的抚养权。你可以拥有这栋房子和公寓。我不想再参与这种生活了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: and I'm leaving and I'm leaving I'm leaving the bag is packed and then he says you're going to be okay you're still young and honestly I was not young I had just turned 50 and and he walked out of the room, walked to our front door, walked out, got in his jeep, and boarded a ferry and left. Um, and one thing I didn't mention is he said before he left, he said, "You, actually, I'm sorry, he said it when he got to New York, he said, um, you can have custody of the kids. You can have the house and the apartment. I don't want any part of this life anymore.

</details>

**Anna**: 我只是听听都觉得晕头转向。我是说，这太令人震惊了。绝对的身体疼痛，双重打击——先是外遇的打击，然后是这个决定的打击。他说你可以拥有孩子的全部抚养权，这一定……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: I mean, I am just hearing about this. I didn't live it and I'm completely disoriented. I mean, I'm like... absolutely um total shock. Total just absolutely physical pain that this had happened and a double shock because there was the shock of the affair and then the shock of this decision. You can have full custody of the kids.

</details>

**Belle**: 那真的让我震惊。还有他说我可以拥有葡萄园岛的房子也让我震惊，因为他非常热爱那个地方和那片土地。但孩子的部分是最令人震惊的。这是整件事中最艰难的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: That really shocked me. That that shocked me. And the saying that I could have the vineyard house shocked me cuz he loved that place and the land so much. Um, but your children, but the the children was the most shocking part. It has been the most difficult part of all of this.

</details>

### 艰难的真相：告知孩子们

**Anna**: 你问过他为什么吗？为什么会发生这种事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Did you ask him why? Why is this happening?

</details>

**Belle**: 他走的时候我没机会问，因为他走得很快。所以我一直给他打电话。我会去孩子们听不到的地方——车库、森林，或者又是浴室，不停地打电话，哀求他告诉我，向我解释，告诉我我哪里做错了，他哪里不开心。或者说他爱上了别人，这虽然痛苦，但至少是个解释，能让事情说得通。但他做不到，或者不愿做。他说这不是我的错，这本该是种安慰，但其实是个非答案。他什么都不肯给我。他唯一告诉我的就是，他觉得像是一个开关被关掉了，他以为他想要我们的生活，但他不想要了。他以为他很幸福，但他不幸福，他结束了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: When he left, I didn't have a chance cuz he left very quickly. So, I just kept calling him. I would go to places where the girls couldn't hear me in the garage, in the woods, in my bathroom again, just calling and just begging him to tell me to explain to to tell me what was wrong with me, what he wasn't happy about. Um to say that he was in love, which happens, you know, make anything make sense. it's it would be an explanation. Um, but he he couldn't do it or he wouldn't do it. He said it was not my fault. Um, which should be reassuring, but it's also just a non answer. Um, and he really would give me nothing. And the only thing he would tell me is that he felt like a switch had flipped and that he thought he wanted our life, but he didn't. He thought he was happy, but he wasn't, and that he was done.

</details>

**Anna**: 在某个时刻，你必须告诉孩子们。她们是怎么知道的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: At some point, you you have to tell the kids. Yeah. Um, how did how did they find out?

</details>

**Belle**: 我咨询的一位心理医生建议在疫情没那么可怕之前先不要告诉她们。当然，正如我们所知，疫情并没有变得不可怕，反而更可怕了。但一个月后，我觉得我不能再假装下去了。我们必须告诉她们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: So, a a therapist I spoke with had advised that we not tell them until the pandemic became less scary. And of course, as we all know, it did not. Um, it just became more scary. But after a month, I just thought, I can't keep pretending. I have we have to tell them.

</details>

**Anna**: 在那之前，你一直是怎么跟孩子们说他去哪了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And up up to this point, sorry. What had you been telling the kids about where he was?

</details>

**Belle**: 我说他在纽约工作，他必须回去工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: I said he was in New York working. He had to go back to work.

</details>

**Anna**: 孩子们有没有试着联系他？或者他联系过她们吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And did the kids try to reach out to him? Do you know? Or did he?

</details>

**Belle**: 据我所知没有。他没有主动联系过她们。所以关于发生了什么的这次谈话，将是她们再次面对面交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Not that I know of. Not that I know of. And did he reach out to... He did not reach out to them to my knowledge. So this conversation about what had happened would be the first time he was I mean certainly you were talking face to face again he was talking to the kids.

</details>

**Anna**: 那你是怎么决定的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Okay. So how did you decide to eventually...

</details>

**Belle**: 我丈夫当时正要回岛上，他的老板借给他一架水上飞机。他到了，我看着他走上步道，我心想，他看起来很开心。他看起来脚步轻快。他说他在水上飞机回去前只有 45 分钟。实际上，我想是 90 分钟。我不记得是 45 还是 90 了，总之很短。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: um my husband was on his way up to the island his boss had lent him um use of a sea plane. He arrives and I watched him come up the walkway and what I thought to myself is he seems happy. He seems like kind of, you know, spring in his step. And he said he had 45 minutes until he had to go back to the sea plane. Actually, I think it was 90 minutes. I can't remember if it's 45 or 90, but something short.

</details>

**Anna**: 等等，为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And wait, why?

</details>

**Belle**: 他说飞行员必须回去。所以我坐在沙发上，搂着两个女儿，我丈夫在她们面前走来走去，说了同样的话：“我一直不开心，我决定离婚。” 我小女儿转过头笑着，我想她以为这只是某种表演，是个玩笑。然后她看到我的脸，看到我有多难过，她就尖叫了起来。我大女儿只是平静地坐着，双臂交叉，盯着她父亲。然后我丈夫看着我说：“我饿死了。你能给我做个**三明治**吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Um, he said the pilots had to go back. Um, so I sat on the couch with the girls, my arms around them, and my husband sort of paced in front of them and said the same thing. I've been I've not been happy and I've decided that we're going to divorce. And my younger daughter turned and was smiling and I think she thought this was like some big act and was a joke. Yeah. And then she looked at my face and saw how sad I looked and and she just screamed. And my older daughter just sat very calmly with her arms crossed just she was just watching her father. Um and my husband looked at me and said, "I'm starving. Can you make me a sandwich?"

</details>

**Anna**: 噢，我的天哪，Belle。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Oh my god, Belle.

</details>

**Belle**: 我经历了那种作为父母常有的内心对话。在这种情况下，一个好母亲会怎么做？这是我孩子的父亲。我希望她觉得事情会好起来，我们会成为朋友。我是离异家庭的孩子，我讨厌父母互相说坏话。你希望感觉到父母能够相处。当然，我的另一部分在想：“你在说什么？我才不会给你做三明治。” 但我还是选择了去做三明治。我走进厨房，努力做出我能做出的最好的三明治，因为我想，既然我要做，就不能做一个烂三明治。我要做出他吃过的最好的三明治，这样他就会对自己说：“我怎么能离开这个能做出如此美味三明治的女人呢？” 这就是我当时的真实想法。我是说，我在笑，但这是种苦涩的笑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: And I had one of those moments that I think we have as parents where I have a whole dialogue with myself. What what would a good mother do in this situation? This is my child's father. I want her to feel like things will be okay, that we'll be friends. I'm a child of divorce. I hated if my parents spoke badly of each other. You want to feel like your parents are going to get along. And of course, another part of me is thinking, "What are you talking about? I'm not going to make you a sandwich." Um, but I went with making the sandwich. So, I went to the kitchen and I really tried to make the best sandwich I possibly could cuz I thought if I'm going to do this, I'm not going to make a bad sandwich. I will I will make the best sandwich he has ever had so that he will say to himself, "How could I possibly leave this woman who can make these incredible sandwiches?" This is what I'm thinking to myself. I mean, I'm laughing, but it's a dark laughter.

**Anna**: 确实。那个三明治到底有多好吃？里面夹了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: It is. It's really... But was the sandwich banging? What was on?

</details>

**Belle**: 我不会说它好吃到离谱，但确实是个不错的三明治。用了烤面包，放在漂亮的盘子里，还配了漂亮的餐巾纸。我当时在表演。天哪，其实我有点后悔。我本该说，你自己去做三明治。但我还是做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: It was to I mean, it was I wouldn't say it was unusually banging, but it was it was a good sandwich. It was like toasted bread and put it on a nice plate and got a nice napkin. God. So, I was, you know, I was performing. Um, man, you know, part of me regrets it. I should have been like, make your own sandwich. But I I that's what I did.

</details>

**Anna**: 你做了。你给他做了这个超棒的三明治，然后拿给他？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: You did it. Mhm. You make him this amazing sandwich. Bring it to him.

</details>

**Belle**: 我开始在房子里找他，以为他会和其中一个女儿在一起。但他没和孩子们在一起。我最终在地下室找到了他。我说：“你在干什么？怎么回事？” 他说：“我在找我们的**婚前协议**。如果你有，你必须给我。” 我说：“请不要现在做这种事。请去陪陪孩子们。你马上就要回机场了。” 这次访问的全部意义就是那 90 分钟。请回去看孩子们。但他没有。最终他放弃了，上楼从我手里拿走三明治，在门口吃完，然后又离开了。接着我收到他发来的一条短信，说：“那次探访很棒。” 后面还带个感叹号。我觉得我刚刚经历了一个现实，一个所有父母都恐惧、所有孩子都会永远记住的时刻。但他却试图把它粉饰成一件好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: I start walking around the house looking for him, assuming he's going to be with one of the girls. Yeah, he is not with the girls. Um, and I eventually find him in the basement. And I said, "What are you doing? What's going on?" And he said, "I'm looking for our prenup. If you have it, you have to give it to me." And I said, "Please don't do this now. Please go be with the girls. You have to go back to the airport." The whole point of this visit here 90 minutes or whatever you have. Please go back to see the girls. He didn't. And um eventually he gave up and he came upstairs, took the sandwich from me, ate the sandwich by the door, and then left again. And then I got a text from my husband saying, "That was a great visit." with an exclamation mark. I feel like I've just lived one reality, a moment that all parents dread, all children remember forever. But he was trying to make it something that was good.

### 家族传承与婚姻期待

**Anna**: 你在书中写道，你成长于一个非常显赫的纽约家族。你的血统包括 **John Jay**，还有**范德比尔特家族**（Vanderbilts），你的祖母是 **Babe Paley**，一位非常了不起的杂志编辑和名媛。你在纽约成长的那个世界，是很多人无法接触到的。在你成长过程中，你是否觉得对于婚姻应该是什么样，存在某些规范或期望？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: You write in your book, you know, you grew up in a very prominent New York City family. Your lineage, I guess that's the right word, includes John J. is that correct? the Vanderbilts, you know, your grandmother's Babe Paley, really incredible magazine editor, socialite. This world that you grew up in in New York is not a world that a lot of people have access to. Did you feel like there were certain norms or expectations around how marriage what marriage should be in the way you were raised?

</details>

**Belle**: 在某些方面是的。因为我成长的环境，上东区，然后上私立学校，有一种期望，你会遇到你的伴侣，举办一场体面的婚礼，然后结婚，这有一套剧本。但我觉得更多是内在的，因为我经历过两次离婚：我父母的离婚，然后我母亲和继父的离婚。我内心深处渴望永恒的婚姻，渴望一个完整的家庭。我觉得这是我一生中最想要的东西。我也见过我父亲和继母，他们的婚姻非常美满，那是我的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Um, in some ways, yes. I think because of where I grew up in terms of the Upper East Side and then um you know going to private schools there was um you know an expectation that you would meet your mate and you would get have a nice wedding and you would get married and you know there was sort of a playbook for that. Um but I think it was more internal because I'd been through two divorces. my parents' divorce and then my mother's divorced from my stepfather and I had a year deep yearning for um to be married for eternity and to have an intact family. I think it was the thing I wanted most in life. Um and I had also seen my father and my stepmother who had a wonderful marriage and that was my goal.

</details>

**Anna**: 你认为什么才算是一段好的婚姻？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: What did you think made a good marriage?

</details>

**Belle**: 我现在对此有了更多思考。其实当我结婚选择我丈夫时，我以为我在改进原有的模式。因为我家族里的男人，我非常爱他们，但他们脾气火爆。不是那种超级恐怖的脾气，更像是跺脚。抱歉，我刚才就跺了一下脚。（笑声）总是会有很多大喊大叫。而我丈夫从我见到他的那天起就一直非常冷静。他不相信大喊大叫。我们的房子里真的没有大喊大叫，除了孩子们。所以我以为我真的改进了，我会选一个像他那样冷静的人，那是我成长过程中没有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Well, I've given more thought to that now I think. Um but um I actually thought I was improving on the model when I got married, when I chose my husband. Why? Because um the men in my family, I love them very much, but they have tempers. Um they they have tempers that are not super scary, but more like stomping your feet. And sorry, I just stumped my foot. [laughter] And um and there's always a lot of yelling. And my husband from the day I met him was always very calm. He didn't believe in yelling. He was um our house was really free from yelling other than children yelling. Um and so I thought I had really improved and I I would pick someone who was wonderfully calm in that way that I I did not have growing up.

</details>

**Anna**: 听起来很稳重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: And steady it sounds like.

</details>

**Belle**: 是的，非常稳重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Yes, very steady.

### 扮演的角色与卸下的伪装

**Anna**: 离婚最终敲定时，距离马萨葡萄园岛那个夜晚过去了多久？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: But when the divorce was finalized, how much time had passed since that night on Martha's Vineyard? Like how long did it take to get there?

</details>

**Belle**: 他在 2020 年 3 月离开，我们在 21 年 10 月签署了离婚协议。考虑到所有因素，速度相当快。但我真的做了一个决定，这可能让人们很难理解我为什么还要写书。我真的不想再活在离婚里了。我不想活在“他带走了这个，我跟他结婚 20 年”之类的纠结中。我记得签署协议时想：我签了字，我就把它抛在脑后了。然后我改回了我的**娘家姓**，这让我感到非常有力量。你必须在离婚协议中注明这一点，法官必须同意。然后我经历了在护照和驾照上更改姓名的过程。每一步，以及真正掌控自己的财务生活，每一步都感觉比回头看我得到了什么或没得到什么更有意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: He left in March of 2020 and we were we signed our divorce agreement in October of 21. So all things considered, quite fast. Quite quite fast. Mhm. But I really made a decision, which I think is hard for people to put together with me writing a book. But I really didn't want to live in the divorce anymore. I didn't want to live in the, you know, he walked away with this and I was married to him for 20 years and I, you know, so I remember signing the agreement like I am signing this and I am putting it behind me. And then I went back to my maiden name, which went felt very empowering. And you have to have that in your divorce agreement. The judge has to agree to it. And then I went through this process of changing my name on my passport and my driver's license. And and each step and and really taking control of my financial life. And each step felt like a better focus than looking backward at what I got or didn't get or anything like that.

</details>

**Anna**: 改回了 **Belle Burden**。这是一种收复失地吗？还是某种声明？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Back to flow bell. Back to fair burden. I the whole thing right back. What was that? A reclamation? Was that a a statement? What What was the What was that?

</details>

**Belle**: 我很早就对此非常明确。这与其说是抛弃他的姓（那也是我孩子的姓，这对孩子们来说有点难，她们希望我还是她们中的一员），不如说是回归自我，回归结婚前的那个我，回归我的原生家庭。显然，那是另一个男人的姓，是我父亲的姓，这并不那么女性主义，但感觉真的很好。这是一种非常切实的找回自我的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: It was um I was very clear on it very early and it wasn't so much discarding his name, which is my children's name. Um and that was a little bit hard for my kids. I think they wanted me to stay one of them and our last name. But for me, it really felt like coming back to myself, who I was before I got married, to my family of origin. And obviously, it's another man's name. It's my father's name. It's not that feminist, but it felt really good. It felt like a very tangible way to come back to myself. M

</details>

**Anna**: 现在已经过去五年半了，你对自己为什么会遭遇这一切有清晰的认识了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Um, now 5 and a half years later, do you feel like you have any clarity on why this happened?

</details>

**Belle**: 我能得到的最接近的解释还是来自他，就是那个“开关被关掉”的想法。我经常思考“扮演角色”这件事。我以前认为他在扮演丈夫和父亲的角色，相信那是他的角色。但在某个时刻，我想他是在为自己扮演那个角色，直到某个时刻，这对他来说变得不可持续了。他脱掉了那身**戏服**，他无法优雅地或以一种能解释清楚的方式继续下去了。这就是我的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: The closest I can get to it um because he still has never offered me an explanation. Yeah. Is does come from him, which is the idea of the switch going off. And I think a lot about playing roles and I had used to think of it as he was playing you know the role of husband and father believing that was his role and at some point I think he was playing that role for himself and at some point it became unsustainable for him and he took off that costume and he wasn't able to do it gracefully or in a way that he could explain. And that's how I think about it.

</details>

**Anna**: 脱掉那身戏服。哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Took off that costume. Wow.

</details>

**Belle**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Yeah.

</details>

**Anna**: 我想知道你对这件事的理解是否会继续演变。我也在想，那个“为什么”的问题是否会变得越来越不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: I wonder if your understanding of this will continue to evolve. And I also wonder whether that question of why will become less and less important to you.

</details>

**Belle**: 它已经变得不那么重要了。我想我已经接受了这样一个事实：我不会知道答案，因为我不确定他自己是否知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: It has become less important to me. And I' I think I've made peace with the fact that I won't know because I'm not sure he knows.

</details>

**Anna**: 你喜欢现在的自己吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: Do you like this person you are now?

</details>

**Belle**: 实际上喜欢得多。真的。我以前绝不会这么说。而且我觉得如果我的婚姻没有结束，我不可能成为现在的自己。我永远不会主动结束它。你懂的，我还是很害羞，社交时还是有点尴尬。其中一些特质依然让我觉得艰难。但我感觉我现在完全掌控了自己的生活。当你结婚时，有所有的缓冲和各种东西，我不觉得自己是这样。这是一种不同类型的幸福结局。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: A lot more actually. I really do. I really do. Which I never would have said. Um, and I don't think I would could be this person if my marriage hadn't ended. And I would never have ended it. You know, I'm still shy. I'm still a little bit awkward socially. I Some of that is some of that is still tough for me. Um, but I feel like I fully inhabit my life right now. And I think when you're married and have all the cushioning and all that stuff, you I don't think I was. It's a different kind of happy ending.

</details>

**Anna**: 确实是不同类型的幸福结局。你的书以你在城里偶遇前夫的故事结尾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: It is a different kind of happy ending. Your book ends with you running into your ex-husband in the city.

</details>

**Belle**: 是的。我当时正和一个朋友散步，我们在布鲁克林大桥附近。我听到有人叫我的名字，Belle，Belle。我转头去看是谁，在通往布鲁克林大桥的那条路对面，我前夫站在那里向我挥手，微笑着。他看起来非常开心和愉快，就像我们是失散多年的老友一样。他就像在说：“一切都很好。” 他似乎完全没看到这一切所造成的代价。而这个男人，我曾与之共处 20 年，同床共枕 20 年，我现在完全不认识他了。我不知道他如何打发时间，不知道他的性格，不知道他如何做决定。而且他也完全不了解我。所以我打了个招呼，我能从余光看到他还站在那儿，但我只是继续向前走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Belle**: Yes. I was walking with a friend um and we were walking near Brooklyn Bridge and um I heard my name, someone calling my name, Belle. Belle and I looked to see who it was and across that kind of road where you get on the Brooklyn Bridge. Um my ex-husband was standing there waving at me and smiling. What did he look like? He looked very happy and cheerful and like we were long lost friends. He's just like, "Everything's fine." Like, he just doesn't see the toll that all of this took. And um there is this man I was with for 20 years, slept in bed with for 20 years, and I do not know him anymore. I do not know how he spends his time. I do not know his character. I do not know what how he makes decisions. Um and also that he really does not know me. So I say hi and um I could see out of the corner of my eye he was still standing there but I just kept moving forward.

**Anna**: Belle Burden，谢谢你分享你的故事。它非常有力量。谢谢。

**Anna**: Belle Burden. Thank you for sharing your story. I mean it so powerful. Thank you.

**Anna**: 我们联系了 Belle 的前夫，请他就本期节目中谈到的有关离婚和子女抚养权的一些内容发表评论。这是他的回应：

“虽然我不同意她的许多回忆，也不同意她对我与孩子关系的整体误解，但为了保护孩子们的隐私免受进一步侵犯，我不愿发表更多细节评论。我只想说，我将继续关爱和支持我的孩子们，并得到他们的关爱和支持。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna**: We reached out to Belle's ex-husband for comment on some of the things we talked about in this episode related to their divorce and custody of their children. This is his response. While I disagree with many of her recollections as well as her overall mischaracterization of my relationship with my children, I do not wish to comment in more detail in order to protect them from further violations of their privacy other than to say that I continue to lovingly support and be lovingly supported by my children.
