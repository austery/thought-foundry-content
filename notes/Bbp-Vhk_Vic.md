### 市场开盘概述：选举、财报与加密货币动荡

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是11月5日，星期三。我们有很多事情要谈，昨天有大量的财报发布，我们稍后会深入探讨。昨天还举行了多场选举，民主党几乎在全国范围内大获全胜，包括纽约市。Zoron（Mumdani）现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are here and live. It is Wednesday, November 5th. A couple days into November and we are live for the open folks. We got a lot of stuff to talk about. We had a ton of earnings yesterday that we are going to get into. We had a ton of elections happen yesterday where the Democrats had pretty much a clean sweep across the entire country including New York City. Zoron is now the mayor of New York. So we have that that took place last night.</p>
</details>

昨晚，如果你在美东时间晚上8:30到9:30左右查看你的投资组合，会发现市场一片血雨腥风，场面很难看。我开始收到人们发来的短信，问：“嘿，发生什么了？为什么跌得这么厉害？”我当时也一无所知。到晚上11点左右，大多数选举结果公布后，市场基本收复了失地。虽然没有完全恢复，但已经有了相当程度的反弹，摆脱了那种惨烈的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last night if you were looking at your portfolio in the overnight markets, call it around 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. It was a blood bath. It was ugly. And I started getting texts from people like, "Yo, what is happening? Why is it dumping so bad?" I didn't have any idea. By around 11 p.m. after most of the elections were called, we pretty much recovered. Now, we didn't recover entirely, but there was a decent level of recovery that got rid of the extent of that blood bath.</p>
</details>

在那段时间里，以太坊非常接近跌破3000美元，比特币确实跌破了10万美元。现在以太坊价格是3350美元，我知道这远不及过去一个月的水平，但至少没有跌破3000美元。比特币也反弹至102,800美元以上，考虑到昨晚曾跌至99,000美元左右，这也不算太糟。所以，如果你昨晚睡得早，没有看投资组合，你就没有目睹那场屠杀，而现在市场已经有了一些复苏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum was very close to going below 3,000 during that time. Bitcoin did go below 100,000. And Ethereum right now at 3350, which I know is not near anywhere where it was over the past month, but at least it's not below 3,000. Then Bitcoin right here making a rebound above 102.8, which is also not as bad either, given it was at like 99 last night. So, if you just slept early last night and didn't look at your portfolio, you didn't see some of the carnage that was happening and now you've had a little bit of more of a recovery.</p>
</details>

### 选举结果对市场情绪的潜在影响

尽管如此，我认为选举前那种不确定性所带来的不稳定或波动性已经得到了解决。因此，市场不再是兴奋，而是一种普遍的“嘿，我们不必那么害怕了”的心态。我对此的初步理论是，昨晚民主党在几乎每个州都大获全胜，包括我的家乡新泽西州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless, I think some of the instability or volatility of not knowing what would happen in the elections was resolved. And as a result of that, you got a lot more not excitement in the markets, but just general like, hey, we don't have to be that afraid. And sort of my working theory around this is that Democrats sweeped last night across pretty much every state including my home state, New Jersey.</p>
</details>

我认为这向共和党人表明，他们将不得不重新开放政府并与民主党人谈判。因为到了这个地步，如果政府停摆继续，而民主党昨晚在全国大获全胜，你就不想冒险在中期选举中失去众议院和参议院。政府停摆的时间越长，民主党就越有机会将责任归咎于共和党人——尽管共和党人也在将责任推给民主党人——这只会增加在中期选举中失利的波动性。因此，这对于执政党来说不是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think what that showed the Republicans is they're going to have to reopen to the government and negotiate with the Democrats because at this point, if the shutdown continues to happen and the Democrats had a clean sweep last night across the entire country, you don't want to risk the midterms and losing the House and the Senate. And the longer the government is shut down and the more opportunity Democrats have to pin this on the Republicans, even though Republicans are pinning it on the Democrats, it just creates more volatility on potentially losing the midterms. And as a result, that would not be good for the party in power.</p>
</details>

所以，也许市场正在消化这样的预期：嘿，这是给所有人敲响的警钟，政府必须重新开放。而政府的重新开放可能成为推动市场不再像以前那样恐慌的顺风。我认为这大概就是目前的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so maybe the market's kind of pricing in, hey, this is a kick in the ass to everybody to say the government's got to reopen and the government reopening could be the tailwind to get the market to not be as scared as it was before. So I think that's kind of what's going on right here, but we'll talk more about it.</p>
</details>

### 盘前动态与财报焦点

我们有昨天发布的AMD和SMCI的财报，稍后会讨论。今天早上Lemonade的业绩绝对是碾压级的，我们也会谈到。Lemonade股价上涨14%是理所当然的，他们的财报表现确实令人难以置信。我们还有其他一些财报，比如麦当劳等。标普500指数微涨。SoFi也在上涨，昨晚一度跌破29美元，现在回到了29.81美元。Grab股价为5.81美元。英伟达上涨0.5%，昨晚曾跌至190美元左右。Palantir曾跌至181美元。你可以看到很多股票都在反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got AMD earnings from yesterday. SMCI earnings, we'll talk about that. Lemonade absolutely crushed it this morning. We'll get into that. Lemonade right there deserves to be up 14%. I mean, absolutely incredible. It was absolutely an incredible incredible earnings from Lemonade and so wasn't too bad to kind of see those results. We had a bunch of other earnings. McDonald's etc. S&P slightly green. SoFi right there up. SoFi was like below 29 last night. Now it's above 29.81. Grab right there at 581. Nvidia up half a percent. Nvidia got down to like 190. Palantir got down to like 181. I mean you're just seeing a bunch of different rebounds.</p>
</details>

Robin Hood今天发布财报。我会在3:30和Roy、Tanner一起直播。这将会是今天的大事。周一Palantir的财报非常出色，今天轮到Robin Hood了，所以这将非常重要。除了Robin Hood，还有很多其他公司，我们都会在财报直播中覆盖。特斯拉的股东投票将在明天举行，目前股价在451美元，上涨了1.5%，表现不错。所以盘前市场是绿色的。这种绿色能否持续？谁知道呢？但至少在昨天之后我们看到了一些绿色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood earnings are today. I'll be live at 3:30 with Roy and Tanner. This is going to be a big one today. We had Palantir on Monday. They crushed it. Robin Hood is going to be today. So this is going to be a very big one. We got a lot of other companies besides Robin Hood as well. So we'll be covering that all on earnings. And then Tesla, the shareholder vote is tomorrow. Tesla right there at 451. Very nice to see. That's up 1.5%. So you have a green pre-market. Will this green pre-market continue? Who knows? But at least we do have some green after yesterday.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，昨天如果你没有关注市场，你可能没注意到，但加密货币市场有2500亿美元被清算。2500亿美元的清算显然给各行各业带来了巨大的痛苦。我仍然不知道为什么会有这么大规模的加密货币清算，不知道是杠杆问题还是人们恐慌性抛售。但如果你看看这个屏幕，所有东西都受到了冲击。所以，今天我们能有一定程度的恢复，已经令人鼓舞了。但昨天确实是一场血洗。看起来我们正在获得一些复苏，我们将在今天余下的时间里继续关注其他财报，看看这种势头能否持续到本周末。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yesterday, by the way. I mean, again, if you just didn't pay attention to the markets yesterday, you probably didn't notice, but $250 billion dollars in the crypto markets were liquidated. And the fact that $250 billion dollars were liquidated in the crypto markets, obviously that caused a lot of pain across a variety of industries. I still don't know why there was that much crypto liquidation. I don't know if it's leverage, if it's people that were just panic selling, but if you take a look at this screen right here, everything got hit. So, the fact that we're even getting somewhat of recovery today is encouraging to see. But yeah, yesterday was a bit of a blood bath. It seems like we're getting a little recovery and we're going to cover the rest of the earnings throughout the day and see if this can continue as we get into the end of this week.</p>
</details>

### 深入解读纽约市长选举

好的，我们开始吧。首先快速谈谈选举结果，然后再继续。民主党大获全胜，Mumdani成为纽约市新任市长。他将于一月份宣誓就职。昨晚我观看了他的胜选演讲，场面相当惊人。我必须说，演讲的基调非常自负。客观地说，那不是一种谦逊的、呼吁“让我们团结城市”的演讲，而更像是“我们赢了，这是一个新城市，一种新的政治思维范式”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started. I think we'll just get started real quick on the election results and then we'll keep going from there. Democrats had a clean sweep. Mandani is the new mayor of New York City. In January, he will be sworn in as the mayor. It was quite incredible to see. I did watch his victory speech last night. I will definitely say the tone of the victory speech was very braggadocious. I think objectively it was not one of those humble hey you know let's bring the city together. It was mother effer we won this is a new city this is a new paradigm of thinking of politics.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，演讲中带有非常强烈的阶级斗争信息。他引用了过去著名的社会主义者作为论据，这让我觉得相当不可思议。在我看过的很多视频和片段中，Mumdani更像是一个和蔼可亲、试图与你交朋友的人。但这次的演讲，在某些时刻听起来几乎就像是“我们要推翻资本家阶级”。我没想到演讲会如此激进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And quite frankly there was a very strong classfocused message in the speech. I mean, he was quoting famous socialists of the past as references for trying to make the argument that he was making, which I thought was quite incredible. I mean, I you know, Mandani from what I've seen in a lot of different videos and clips is more so this like guy who's like nice and just trying to be your friend. This one was like quite literally this one was like we are going to take over the capitalist class and and to an extent it almost literally sounded like that in certain moments. So, I thought that was quite incredible. I didn't expect the speech to be as aggressive as he went for.</p>
</details>

演讲的核心是：这是属于工薪阶层的时代。工薪阶层决定朝着一个明确为他们服务的方向前进。现在需要几年时间来看看，是否有任何进展能够匹配Mumdani过去几个月所宣扬的雄心壮志。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but the speech was, hey, this is the time for working-class people. Working class people decided to make a decision to go in a direction that is explicitly for them. And now it's going to take a few years to see if there's any level of progress that matches the reality or matches the ambition of what Mumdani has been saying over the past couple of months.</p>
</details>

从人口统计数据来看，按性别和年龄划分，18至29岁的男性中有68%投票给了Mumdani，而18至29岁的女性中则有84%投票给了他。所以我们谈论的是千禧一代的男性和女性。未来几天，我们将获得更多关于种族、性别和人口统计的队列数据，以了解投票的最终情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are the demographics. So if you look at it by gender and age, you had men 18 to 29, 68% of them went for Mumani and then women 18 to 29, 84% of them went for Mumani. So you're talking about millennial men and women and we're going to get a lot more cohorts of race and gender and demographics over the coming days in terms of how the vote ended out.</p>
</details>

说真的，如果你当时在看报道，投票结果在五分钟内就揭晓了。首先，纽约的选举投票率历来很低。我认为这次有两百万人投票，这至少是过去几十年来市长选举的记录。两分钟之内，当他们统计完大部分行政区后，布朗克斯是最后一个。布朗克斯是全市民主党色彩最浓厚的区。这基本上就是Mumdani的胜利了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But dude, the vote was called if you were looking at the coverage, the vote was called within like five minutes because New York, first of all, New York is known for historically low election voting turnout. So I think two million people voted, which was like a record at least over the past couple decades for these mayoral elections. And within two minutes, as soon as they got most of the burrows, the Bronx was the last burrow. Bronx is the most heavily democratic burrow in the city. It it was Mani's race. It was it.</p>
</details>

我不会说这是一次压倒性的授权，因为Cuomo获得了42%的选票，Mumdani大约51%，而Silva大约7%。所以即使Silva退出，所有选票都流向Cuomo，Cuomo仍然会输，但Mumdani的领先优势会缩小到3%或4%，竞争会激烈得多。因此，我不会说这是一次全面的授权，不像特朗普在2024年赢得几乎所有摇摆州那样。但无论如何，这是纽约在如何治理自身方面采取了一种全新的思维方式。Mumdani现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, I wouldn't say it was a mandate because Cuomo got 42% of it. Mdani had like 51 and then Silva had like seven. So, even if Silva had left and that all that went to Cuomo, Cuomo still would have lost, but it would have been like a 3 or 4% margin by which Mdani would have win. It would have been a lot closer. And so, I wouldn't say it's a full-on mandate like Trump had, you know, by winning almost every single swing state in well, literally every single swing state in 2024. But nonetheless, it was New York making an entirely new way of thinking in regards to how they're going to govern themselves. And Mandani is now the mayor of New York. So there you go.</p>
</details>

这对市场意味着什么？坦白说，它为昨晚的市场增添了很多确定性。在选举结果公布之前，市场正在下跌。我认为市场只是想要一些确定性。昨晚我们相对迅速地得到了确定性，你看到了市场的反弹。或者，这可能对市场毫无意义，只是算法交易在选举期间来回操作，造成了一些选举波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does this mean for the markets? Quite frankly, it added a lot of clarity to the markets last night and realistically before the markets or before the elections were called, the markets were dumping. I think the markets just wanted some clarity. I really do. and the fact that we got clarity last night relatively quickly you saw the markets rebounding or it could mean nothing for the markets and it was just convenient that Algo started going back and forth during the election and that was some of the election volatility.</p>
</details>

但归根结底，我不知道这对于选举本身说明了什么。纽约市长必须与奥尔巴尼的州长合作才能完成任何事情。如果他想实现免费公交、免费医疗保健、儿童保育或对富人增税，他真的需要与纽约州合作，而不仅仅是纽约市议会，因为后者的权力不大。所以，现在需要几年时间来看看Mumdani能否执行他的整体政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I don't know if it says much about the election at the end of the day the mayor of New York has to govern with the or has to work with the governor of Albany to be able to get anything done if he wants to actually get free buses or free healthcare or child care or raise taxes on the rich like you're really going to need to work with New York State not just the New York City state assembly because they don't have that much power and So, it's now going to be a couple years to see if Mumdani can carry out this overall policy.</p>
</details>

一直强烈反对Mumdani的Bill Ackman昨天发了一条非常简单的推文：“Mumdani，祝贺你获胜。现在你责任重大。如果我能在纽约市提供任何帮助，请告诉我我能做什么。”所以，尽管他曾极力反对这个人获胜，但他现在准备帮助纽约市。Bill Ackman是土生土长的纽约人，他显然热爱这座城市，想留在这里，很可能不会搬去迈阿密。但这就是Ackman在这次选举后采取的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Bill Aman, who's been very against Mumani, he tweeted yesterday, 140 characters, very simple. Mumdani, congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help in NYC, just let me know what I can do. So, uh, although he was vehemently against this guy winning, uh, he's ready to help New York City. And, you know, Bill Aman's a native New Yorker. He obviously loves the city. He wants to be in the city. is likely not leaving to Miami. Um, but that is the approach that Aman is taking now based on this election. So, there you go.</p>
</details>

### ADP就业数据及其解读

好了，这就是昨晚发生的事情，市场似乎已经翻篇了。现在我们将转向2026年的中期选举。今天早上我们得到了**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: 美国自动数据处理公司，其发布的私营部门就业报告是重要的经济指标）私营部门就业数据。我忘了我们会得到这个数据，但它来了。新增就业42,000人，预期为22,000人。还不错。这之前是9月份的29,000人下降。所以劳动力市场出现了一定程度的向好稳定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what we got. That's what happened last night and markets seem to be moving on from it. And now we will move on to midterms going into 2026. Okay, private ADP payrolls. We got that this morning. I forgot we were getting this number, but we got it. 42,000 versus 22,000 expected. Not too bad. It follows a 29,000 decline in September. So you have some level of stability to the upside in the labor market.</p>
</details>

市场原以为私营部门会增加22,000个工作岗位，但10月份的ADP数据显示我们增加了42,000个。再次强调，9月份我们是减少了29,000个。所以，尽管我们没有政府发布的劳动力市场数据，没有像JOLTS或失业救济申请这样的各种工具，但我们确实有一些第三方数据，这些数据表明报告可能没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The market thought we would add 22,000 jobs on the private payroll sector. October ADP showed we added 42,000. Again, we had a 29,000 decline in September. So although we don't have labor market data from the government, we don't have a variety of different tools like jolts or jobless claims from the government. We do have some of this third party data which is signaling that maybe the reports are not as bad.</p>
</details>

一些人说这是好消息还是坏消息，之所以说好消息可能是坏消息，是因为我们需要降息的原因是劳动力市场正在走弱。所以如果劳动力市场在走强，这难道不会阻碍降息吗？我并不这么认为。这是一个好的报告，但不是一个惊人的报告。我的意思是，它不是那种“天啊，我们增加了50万个工作岗位”的水平。我们增加了44,000个，而且正如你看到的细分数据，少于50名员工的小企业实际上在裁员，唯一增加就业的是超过500名员工的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some people are saying is this good news is bad news and the reason you would say it's good news is bad news is because the reason we need a rate cut is because the labor market is weakening. So if the labor market is strengthening, wouldn't this oppose the ability to get a rate cut? And I don't really think that's the case. This was a good report. This was not a phenomenal report. So what I mean by that is this was not like oh my god we added 500,000 jobs. This is we added 44,000 and as you saw the breakdown right there small businesses less than 50 employees actually lost jobs and the only businesses that added jobs were businesses above 500 employees.</p>
</details>

归根结底，小企业是国家的支柱。所以如果你有小企业在挣扎，很可能因为利率太高而无法承担资本成本，他们就无法继续雇佣员工。如果这种效应在全国范围内持续累积，很明显你会看到劳动力市场更加疲软。所以，这是一个好的报告，因为如果我们得到一个负的就业数据，那就意味着我们真的需要降息了。我们现在仍然非常需要降息，只是情况没有像出现负50万就业岗位那样危急。因为如果是那样的话，就说明我们的经济存在根本性问题，降息可能都无法解决，因为降息需要一年时间才能产生任何有意义的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and small businesses at the end of the day at the backbone of the country. So if you do have small businesses that are hurting and likely cannot afford the cost of capital because rates are too high. They can't continue to employ people. If that effect continues to compound across the entire country I mean obviously you're going to get a lot more labor market weakness. So this was a good report in the fact that if we had a negative jobs number it would signal that we really need a rate cut. We still really need a rate cut. It's just not as dire of a situation as if we had like negative 500,000 jobs because if that's the case then we have an underlying problem in the economy and rate cuts probably are not even going to solve that because you need a year for rate cuts to even have any level of meaningful impact.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是一个不错的报告，不是最好的，也不是最坏的，但它足以强化这样一个论点：我们将继续看到12月份的降息。尽管鲍威尔和美联储希望尽可能表现出谨慎，我们很可能会得到12月份的降息，并且继续获得这次降息是很重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it was a good report. It was not the best report, not the worst report, but it was enough of a report, I think, to reinforce this argument that we are going to continue to see a December rate cut. Even though JPO and the Fed want to signal as much caution as they can, we're likely getting that December cut and it is important that we continue to get that cut.</p>
</details>

### 关键公司财报回顾

好的，财报。我们今天有很多财报。首先，我们快速看一下AMD。在我看来，AMD的业绩非常出色。我认为AMD的财报没什么问题。我们和Jose Neil一起做了直播。股价在244美元，下跌了大约2%。营收增长了36%。他们超出了每股收益（EPS）预期。指引也比预期的要强一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, earnings. Let's get into it. So, we had a lot of earnings today. First of all, let's just real quick do AMD. AMD crushed it in my opinion. I don't think AMD had a bad earnings. We covered it live with Jose Neil. 244. It's down about 2%. Revenue was up 36%. They beat on EPS. The guide was a bit stronger than expected.</p>
</details>

他们在财报电话会议上被问及能提供哪些关于指引的具体细节，但他们没能真正给出这些细节，因为他们下周会有一个投资者活动。所以他们把很多信息留到了下周。但总的来说，EPS超出预期3%，营收超出预期6%。营收同比增长36%，EPS增长30%。我认为这是一个相当不错的季度，季度本身没有任何值得担忧的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did get questioned on the earnings call on what exactly they can give on terms of details on the guide and they weren't able to really give those details because they're going to have some investor event next week. So, they're saving a lot of that information for next week. But overall, 3% beat on on EPS, 6% beat on revenue. Revenue is up 36% year-over-year. EPS up 30%. I thought it was a pretty good quarter and I don't think there was anything to be concerned about in the quarter itself.</p>
</details>

它不像甲骨文的拉里·埃里森那样，**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligation: 剩余履约义务）增长了三四百个百分点。所以他们有点像是在计入甲骨文和OpenAI的指引，但没有真正展示很多具体的数字。因为如果他们真的展示了，他们给出的营收指引至少会是354%的增长，但他们给出的指引是大约25%，这是合理的。这比他们上个季度14%的数据中心营收要好得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It wasn't some massive uh Larry Ellison Oracle type of RPO growth that was up like 3 400%. So they're kind of baking in the Oracle the open eye guidance but not legitimately showing uh a lot of those numbers because if they were to legitimately show you know they'd be guiding for revenues of minimum of like 354% but they're guiding for about 25% which is reasonable. It's way better than the 14% data center revenues that they had uh last quarter.</p>
</details>

所以，现在股价相对平稳。再次强调，在宣布与OpenAI合作后，股价从150美元涨到了250美元。所以它现在没有太大变动了。Palantir也是一样，对吧？经历了大涨之后，与几周前相比，现在相对平稳。所以我认为持有AMD的人不应该太沮丧，因为你们的大动作，你们真正的“超级碗”时刻，发生在一个月前，当他们宣布与OpenAI建立合作关系时。一旦宣布了，那才是真正的上涨。如果它继续上涨，那很好。但如果下跌，考虑到它在一个月内基于与OpenAI的合作关系增加了1000亿美元的市值，而他们甚至还没有从OpenAI获得任何收入，你也不能太不知足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, the stock is relatively flat now. Again, the stock moved from 150 to 250 after that opening ideal. So, it's not moving that much anymore. Same thing with Palanteer, right? Made a big move. It's relatively flat compared to where it was a couple weeks ago. So, I don't think anyone who's in AMD should be that upset because your big move, your real Super Bowl happened a month ago when they announced the opening eye partnership. Once that was announced, that really was the move. And if it goes higher, that's great. But if it goes lower, I you can't be that ungrateful given it added, you know, 100 billion of market cap in a month based on that OpenAI partnership and they don't even have any revenue from OpenAI.</p>
</details>

CrowdStrike和Core宣布建立全球合作伙伴关系，为“代理时代”（Agentic Era）提供安全的AI云基础，并加速实现安全的**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能）。这个标题里的时髦词汇真是太多了。代理时代，安全AGI。天哪。好吧，让我们看看CrowdStrike的股价是否上涨。没有，CrowdStrike股价平稳。Coreweave涨了一点。

### Lemonade与Unity业绩亮眼

让我们从Lemonade开始。他们业绩非常出色。EPS超出预期27%，同比增长46%。营收同比增长42%，超出预期5%。恭喜持有Lemonade的各位。这绝对是令人难以置信的。看看这张图表，保费增长了30%，客户增长了24%，而他们的**毛亏损率**（Gross Loss Ratio: 保险公司赔付金额占已赚保费的百分比）下降了11%。他们做到这一切的同时，自2022年以来，包括增长在内的运营费用仅增长了10%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Let's start off with some of these companies. Lemonade crushed it. They beat by 27% on EPS. EPS is up 46% year-over-year. Revenue is up 42% year-over-year as they beat revenue by 5%. Congratulations to those who have Lemonade. Absolutely incredible. If you take a look at this chart right here, premiums are up 30%, customers are up 24%, and their gross loss ratio is down 11%. They did all of this while operating expenses included growth of just 10% since 2022.</p>
</details>

所以Lemonade绝对配得上他们在盘前获得的上涨势头，上涨了70%。而且，这只是一家市值50亿美元的公司。我知道他们还没有盈利，但看起来他们正走在盈利的道路上。他们距离正式实现盈利大约还差51美分。但随着他们继续扩大业务模式，在50亿美元的市值下，也许更值得深入研究。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So Lemonade absolutely deserves the momentum that they're getting right here in the pre-market up 70%. Also, this is only a $5 billion company. So I know they're not profitable yet. It looks like they are on path to getting to profitability. They're about 51 cents away from officially becoming profitable. But it does seem like as they continue to scale that business model and maybe it's worth looking into a lot more at, you know, a $5 billion market cap.</p>
</details>

Unity也表现出色。他们超出预期18%，EPS为20美分，预期为17美分。营收为4.7亿美元，预期为4.53亿美元，超出预期4%。营收同比增长5%，EPS同比增长5%。又一个在营收和利润上都持续超出预期的公司。我们没有确切的汇总统计数据，不知道有多少公司同时超出了营收和利润预期，但数量相当可观。我敢说至少有50%，可能接近75%到80%的公司都做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unity, they crushed it as well. 18% they beat 20 cents versus 17 cents expected and then 4.70 versus 453 million expected. They beat by 4%. Revenues up 5% year-over-year. EPS is up 5% year-over-year. Again, another name that just continues to beat on the top and the bottom. We don't have the exact aggregated stats of how many companies have beat top and bottom, but it's a decent amount. I would argue it's minimum 50%, probably closer to 75 to 80% of companies that have be on the top and the bottom.</p>
</details>

Unity在盘前上涨了18%。哇，Unity和Lemonade。你知道，这就是牛市健康的一面。如果你能实现双重超预期，并交出真正好的财报，你就会得到奖励。如果做不到，你就会被重创。这些公司正在证明他们可以做到，即使他们不是世界上最大的公司，这一点非常重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Unity, right? They're up 18% in the pre-markets. Wow. Unity and lemonade. And you know, this is the healthy part of a bull market. If you can double beat and really give some good earnings, you're going to get rewarded. If you can't, you're going to get crushed. And these companies are showing that they can, even if they're not the biggest companies in the world, which is very important.</p>
</details>

### 其他值得关注的财报与新闻

麦当劳的业绩未达预期，EPS为3.22美元，低于预期的3.33美元，营收为70亿美元，低于预期的70.9亿美元。营收同比增长3%，但EPS同比下降。麦当劳的股价实际上是上涨的。我没听到他们在电话会议或指引中说的所有内容，但我认为他们确实说了一件事，那就是同店销售额同比增长了约3%。所以情况并没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">McDonald's, they missed by 3%. 322 versus 333 expected on EPS and then 7.0 over 7.09 on revenue. Revenue is up 3% year-over-year. EPS is down year overyear. McDonald's stock is actually up. So, I didn't hear everything they said in the call or in guidance, but I think the one thing they did say was same store sales are up year-over-year by like 3%. So, it's not like that bad.</p>
</details>

Ripple宣布获得由Fortress和Citadel Securities领投的5亿美元投资。哦哇，Steve会喜欢这个消息的。这是否推动了XRP的价格？XRP涨了一点，没什么太疯狂的，但确实涨了。自从稳定币变得更加主流以来，我们已经很久没有听到太多关于Ripple的消息了。因为我感觉Ripple的整个用例，或者至少我从Steve那里理解的是跨境支付。我觉得现在很多其他区块链上的稳定币也在做同样的事情，不仅仅是Ripple。所以，我想我们得随着时间的推移看看结果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ripple announces $500 million investment led by Fortress Citadel Securities. Oh wow, Steve's going to love that. Okay, is that move in XRP price? XRP. It's up a little bit. Nothing too crazy, but it's up a little bit. There you go. Ripple getting a $500 million investment. You know, we haven't heard that much about Ripple ever since like stable coins became more mainstream because I feel like the entire use case of Ripple or at least the way I understand it from Steve was crossber payments. And I feel like that's kind of happening with stable coins on a lot of other blockchains, not just Ripple. So, I guess we're going to see over time if that ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

Solar Edge也超出了预期。EPS为负31美分，好于预期的负42美分；营收为3.4亿美元，高于预期的3.36亿美元。营收同比增长44%，EPS同比增长98%。我们知道几周前Enphase的财报受到了冲击。Solar Edge的股价下跌了6%。即使在营收和利润都表现出色的情况下，太阳能股在过去两年里确实没有达到人们的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Solar Edge, uh, they beat as well. Negative 31 cents versus 42 cents, 340 versus 336. They beat by 1%, 26% beat on EPS. Revenues up 44% year-over-year. EPS is up 98%. Now, we know that Nphase got hit a couple weeks ago on their earnings. Solar Edge is down 6%. Even with a pretty good beat on the top and the bottom, the solar stocks realistically for the past two years have just not been where you want it to be.</p>
</details>

昨天SMCI的财报也出来了。我不知道为什么SMCI被砸得那么惨，但他们确实未达预期。但有点像他们两周前给出的初步结果就已经告诉你他们会未达预期，而分析师们仍然对他们未达预期感到失望，所以股价下跌了。SMCI是一只非常波动的股票，在财报后下跌了约8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we did have SMCI yesterday. I don't know why SMCI got as crushed as it did, but uh they missed. But it's kind of like the preliminary results they gave two weeks ago were telling you they were going to miss and analysts were still upset that they missed and so stock went down. So SMCI right here a very volatile stock that's down about 8% after those numbers.</p>
</details>

昨天真正受到重创的一只股票是Axon。我认为这只是因为估值溢价太高了，股价下跌了21%。这家公司主要向警察销售执法记录仪。他们的EPS未达预期约20%。你知道，他们的股票交易倍数相当激进。在这种情况下，你不能在EPS上失手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one stock that got really wrecked yesterday was Axon. And I think this is just because the valuation had too much of a premium focus down 21% right here. These guys sell body cameras primarily at police officers. They missed on EPS by about 20%. And you know, their stock was just trading at a at a pretty aggressive multiple. You can't miss on EPS when it comes to this type of stuff.</p>

### 特朗普关税政策与最高法院听证会

让我们谈谈关税，因为今天最高法院将正式开始审理对特朗普政府关税政策的挑战。特朗普曾表示，如果最高法院不维持这些关税，这将是这个国家历史上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's talk about tariffs because today is officially the day that the Supreme Court is going to start hearing the challenges to the Trump administration's tariff policy. Trump has said this would be the worst thing for the history of this country if uh we did not have the tariffs continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
</details>

特朗普政府要求最高法院推翻下级法院的一项裁决，该裁决认为大部分关税是非法使用了**IEPA**（International Emergency Economic Powers Act: 国际紧急经济权力法）。特朗普利用该法律征收了他所谓的“芬太尼关税”和“解放日关税”。估计有900亿美元的关税收入悬而未决。财政部表示，如果特朗普政府输掉这场官司，今年很可能不得不退还这笔钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court where remember Trump has appointed three of nine members to reverse a ruling from a lower court that found that most of the tariffs are an illegal use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump has used that law to impose what he called his fentanyl tariffs, his liberation day tariffs earlier this year. An estimated $90 billion in tariff revenue hangs on the high court's ruling here. Treasury has said it most likely would have to send that money back this year if the Trump administration is to lose this case.</p>
</details>

请记住，宪法将征收关税和税收的权力赋予了国会。在特朗普之前，没有总统使用过这部1977年的法律来实施关税。但该法律确实允许总统“监管由外国或外国国民拥有的财产的进口”。白宫表示这足以允许这些关税。但起诉政府的企业认为，监管的权力与征税的权力不同，因此关税应被推翻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now remember, the Constitution gives the power to impose tariffs and taxes to Congress. No president before Trump has used this 1977 law to put tariffs in place. But the law does allow a president to quote regulate imports of property owned by a foreign country or foreign national. Now, the White House says that's enough to allow these tariffs. But the businesses that are suing the administration argue that the power to regulate is not the same as the power to tax and therefore the tariffs should be struck down.</p>
</details>

这里的细微之处在于，这个案子将在今天进行听证，但决定要到一月份才会做出。如果他们做出不利于特朗普关税的裁决——考虑到最高法院的构成，我真的不认为会发生——特朗普政府已经表示，他们有80%到90%的关税可以通过一些后门漏洞来实施。所以即使他们得到一个不利的裁决，特朗普会不高兴，但他仍然认为有办法在不通过行政命令的情况下实施关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the the nuance to this is that this will be decided in January. It's going to be heard today, but they're not going to make a decision for the next couple months. And if they were to go against Trump's tariffs, which I really don't think is going to happen just given the making of the Supreme Court, the Trump administration has said they have 80 to 90% of their tariffs are going to be covered in like some backdoor loopholes for them to be able to navigate how they're going to be able to implement the tariffs. So even if they were to get a tariff ruling that was unfavorable to them, Trump would be upset. But he still thinks there's a way for them to implement the tariffs without going through the executive orders.</p>

### 市场情绪与长期展望

这张图表我觉得非常有趣，是Ryan Dietrich发布的。AAII调查显示，2025年看涨者减去看跌者的比例为负11%。历史上只有三次这个数字低于负10%，而且都发生在熊市中：1990年、2008年和2022年。令人难以置信的是，2008年看跌者比看涨者多11.1%，与2025年的水平完全相同。我们在2025年正处于牛市中。但根据AAII投资者调查——Tom Lee多次提到这是衡量大盘看涨或看跌情绪最重要的调查之一——你看到的看跌情绪读数与2008年大衰退时相同，这有点疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This chart I thought was really interesting as well. This is supposed by Ryan Dietrich. The AI survey, bulls minus bears, is negative 11% in 2025. Only three other times has this ever been negative 10% and they all happened in bare markets. 1990, 2008, and 2022. Incredibly, bears outnumber bulls by 11.1% based on this survey in 2008, the exact same level as 2025. We are in a bull market in 2025. But based on the AI investor survey, which Tom Le has talked about many times is one of the most important surveys to get a gauge on if people are bullish or bearish in the broader stock market, you have the same reading of bearishness as you had in 2008 when we had the great recession, which is kind of crazy, dude.</p>
</details>

Evercore ISI的Julian Emanuel也表达了类似的观点。他认为，尽管短期内存在美元走强等宏观经济担忧，导致比特币等风险资产承压，但强劲的盈利增长是核心支撑。在英伟达公布财报之前，我们无法完全了解盈利的全貌，但从目前看到的财报来看，似乎很难看空这个市场。Evercore甚至表示，到2026年，标普500指数可能会远超8000点，这仅仅是基于这些公司继续执行、表现良好、回购股票，并在AI成为顺风的背景下整体提振市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's basically what Evercore ISIS's Julian Emanuel says. his kind of core argument right here is that earnings are strong. you are getting some dollar strength which potentially is taking away some of the value from the other riskon trades that are kind of a hedge against the dollar continuing to get stronger like a bitcoin. In the midst of those macroeconomic concerns around kind of the short-term nature of the volatility with the dollar going up and other trades reacting as a result of the of the Dixie going higher, you have earnings growth. And until we get Nvidia, we're not going to fully understand what the earnings picture looks like. But based on the earnings picture we've seen so far, it just seems like it's hard to fade this market. Evercore even said by 2026 we could be pushing well above 8,000 on the S&P 500 just based on the idea that these companies continue to execute, continue to perform, continue to buy back their stock, continue to overall lift the market as AI becomes the tailbone.</p>

### 政府停摆与特斯拉股东投票

关于政府停摆，有新的进展。民主党领导人致信特朗普，要求会面。舒默和杰弗里斯寻求会面以结束政府停摆。也许这意味着本周末我们将在停摆问题上取得一些进展。特朗普刚刚表示，我们必须尽快让政府重新开放，这正在影响股市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh shutdown headlines. Democratic leaders write letter to Trump demanding a meeting. Schumer Jeffrey seek meeting to end government shutdown. Okay, maybe that means by the end of this week we are going to get some level of progress on the shutdown. Trump right now just said we have to get the government back open soon. It's affecting the stock market now.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我们现在正式处于有史以来最长的政府停摆期，已经36天了，超过了2018年的记录。根据几位参议员昨天的说法以及今天民主党人致特朗普的信，我确实认为到本周末，他们至少有很大机会举行一次更重要的会议，因为到目前为止，没有人希望这种情况继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, we are now, by the way, we are now in the official um largest shutdown. We're officially in the largest shutdown ever. 36 days. We have passed 2018. And so based on what a couple senators said yesterday and based on this uh letter from the Democrats today for Trump, I do think by the end of the week there is a decent chance they at least have a bigger meeting because no one at this point wants to continue this going.</p>
</details>

关于特斯拉，昨天有一个大新闻。一些特斯拉意见领袖呼吁将他们的股票从嘉信理财（Schwab）撤出，以防嘉信理财在薪酬方案上投票反对董事会。Sawyer Merritt、Jason Debolt等特斯拉社区的大人物都发声了。随后，嘉信理财就特斯拉代理投票发表声明，表示将投票支持董事会。这真是太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yesterday there was a big headline for some Tesla influencers to take off their shares from Schwab in case Schwab voted with uh or against the board for the compensation package. And Sawyer Mera, Jason Debolt, a lot of these big people in the Tesla community, they put their voices out there. They said, "You guys, we are ready to take our shares off the platform." And then Schwab issues a statement on the Tesla proxy and says, "We will be voting in favor with the board." This was pretty crazy. This was pretty crazy to see.</p>
</details>

看到散户投资者团结起来，真是令人难以置信。甚至Vlad也帮了忙，他说：“嘿，我们会为任何想离开嘉信理财并把特斯拉股票转到Robin Hood的人提供匹配奖励。”结果他并不需要真的这么做，因为嘉信理财最终屈服了。但这显示了散户的力量，以及散户可以变得多么成熟。特斯拉从一开始就是一个散户的故事。散户投资者比机构投资者更早、更好地理解了这个故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it was quite incredible to see retail investors come together. Even Vlad helped out. Vlad said, "Hey, we'll give anyone a match who wants to leave uh Schwab and bring their Tesla shares on to Robin Hood." and he didn't really have to, you know, do that uh because Schwab ended up capitulating. It goes to show the power of retail. It goes to show how sophisticated retail can be. And you know, Tesla is a retail story since the beginning. Retail investors have understood the story way better than institutions.</p>

Lemonade财报出色，股价大涨13%。Unity也一度上涨18%，现在涨幅收窄至11%。Zeta同样上涨了13%。你可以看到很多市值低于200亿美元的小公司正在交出必要的业绩，不仅是为了证明他们的高增长估值，也是为了继续获得这种估值。

<p class="english-text">Lemonade they had a massive earnings. They are up 13%. 13% move on Lemonade getting a big move right there. Unity Unity is up 18. It was up 18, now it's up 11, losing 7%. So, Unity up 11, Lemonade up 14. Zeta 13% on Zeta. There you go. I mean you had a lot of these smaller companies under 20 billion that are putting up results that are necessary to justify not only their growth multiple but to continue getting a growth multiple.</p>

今天有很多公司将发布财报。除了Robin Hood，还有Duolingo、AppLovin、ARM、Fortinet、ELF、Joby、Snapchat、DoorDash、Lyft、FICO、Qualcomm等等。我们将重点关注Robin Hood，但也会在盘后关注所有这些公司，看看牛市的势头能否继续在小公司中蔓延。

I mean, you've got a lot of companies, lots and lots and lots of companies that are reporting today. So, we're going to be covering Robin Hood, but we'll be looking at all those companies as well after the bell. and we're gonna see if we can continue getting a lot of this bull market momentum spreading through the smaller companies.</p>
</details>

关于Palantir，我认为财报非常出色。Steve昨晚也在谈论它，他认为Palantir的S曲线甚至还没有真正开始。考虑到他们只有911个客户，你可以想象S曲线还有很多年的发展空间。但股价中已经包含了大量的增长预期。归根结底，这是谁也无法否认的事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought the earnings were exceptional. I think all of us know the earnings were exceptional. Steve was talking about it last night. I mean, Steve Steve was talking about the S-curve for Pounder hasn't even happened yet. And and it's kind of crazy to think that, but then again, they only have 911 customers. Like, you can imagine that the S-curve has many, many years of runway left to really take place, but there's a lot of growth baked into the stock. Like, at the end of the day, that's just something no one can deny.</p>
</details>

我完全不同情任何抱怨Palantir股价的人。我真的不。我理解股价从210美元跌到183美元，但要知道，在210美元时它很贵，在183美元时它依然很贵。而这只股票在一月份时才60美元。所以，任何抱怨20美元下跌的人，我不知道……我认为在那个时候，你过于关注股价，而没有真正看到这个季度的基本面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have zero zero sympathy for anyone complaining about Palant's part. I just don't I really don't just don't. I understand the stock was at 210, now it's at 183. Guess what? At 210 it was expensive. At 183, it's expensive. And the stock was at 60 in January. So, it's like anyone complaining about a $20 move to the downside is just not I don't know. I think at that point you're way too obsessed with the stock price and not really looking at the fundamentals of what happened at the quarter.</p>
