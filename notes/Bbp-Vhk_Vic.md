title: 市场解读：选举尘埃落定，加密货币企稳，财报季喜忧参半

### 选举尘埃落定与市场隔夜动荡

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是11月5日，星期三。我们有很多事情要谈。昨天有大量的财报发布，我们稍后会深入探讨。昨天还举行了大量选举，民主党在全国范围内几乎大获全胜，包括纽约市。Zoron（应为 Mandani）现在是纽约市长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are here and live. It is Wednesday, November 5th. couple days into November and we are live for the open folks. We got a lot of stuff to talk about. We had a ton of earnings yesterday that we are going to get into. We had a ton of elections happen yesterday where the Democrats had pretty much a clean sweep across the entire country including New York City. Zoron is now the mayor of New York. So we have that that took place last night.</p>
</details>

昨晚，如果你在盘后市场，大约晚上8:30到9:30之间查看你的投资组合，那简直是一场血洗，场面非常难看。我开始收到人们发来的短信，问：“嘿，发生什么事了？为什么跌得这么厉害？”我当时也一无所知。大约到晚上11点，大多数选举结果公布后，市场基本恢复了。虽然没有完全恢复，但已经有了相当程度的反弹，摆脱了那场血洗的惨状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, last night if you were looking at your portfolio in the overnight markets, call it around 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. It was a blood bath. It was ugly. And and like I started getting texts from people like, "Yo, what is happening? Why why is it dumping so bad?" I didn't have any idea. By around 11 p.m. after most of the elections were called, we pretty much recovered. Now, we didn't recover entirely, but there was a decent level of recovery that got rid of the extent of that blood bath.</p>
</details>

在那段时间，以太坊非常接近跌破3000美元，比特币确实跌破了10万美元。现在以太坊的价格是3350美元，我知道这远不及过去一个月的水平，但至少没有低于3000美元。比特币也反弹至102.8美元以上，考虑到昨晚曾跌至99美元左右，这也不算太糟。所以，如果你昨晚睡得早，没有看你的投资组合，你就没有目睹那场惨状，而现在市场已经有了一些复苏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum was very close to going below 3,000 during that time. Bitcoin did go below 100,000. Uh, and Ethereum right now at 3350, which I know is not near anywhere where it was over the past month, but at least it's not below 3,000. Then Bitcoin right here making a rebound above 102 102.8, which is also not as bad either, uh, given it was at like 99 last night. So, if you just slept early last night and didn't look at your portfolio, you you didn't see some of the the carnage that was happening and now you've had a little bit of more of a recovery.</p>
</details>

尽管如此，我认为选举结果的不确定性所带来的一些不稳定或波动性已经得到解决。因此，市场不再那么恐慌，虽然谈不上兴奋。我的一个初步理论是，民主党昨晚在几乎每个州都取得了压倒性胜利，包括我的家乡新泽西州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh nonetheless, I think some of the instability or volatility of not knowing what would happen in the elections was resolved. And as a result of that, you got a lot more uh not excitement in the markets, but just general like, hey, we don't have to be that afraid. And sort of my my my my working theory around this is that Democrats sweeped last night across pretty much every state uh including my home state, New Jersey.</p>
</details>

我认为这向共和党表明，他们将不得不重新开放政府并与民主党进行谈判。因为到了这个地步，如果政府停摆继续，而民主党昨晚在全国范围内大获全胜，你就不想冒着在中期选举中失去众议院和参议院的风险。政府关门的时间越长，民主党就越有机会将责任归咎于共和党，尽管共和党也在指责民主党。这只会增加在中期选举中失利的波动性。因此，这对于执政党来说不是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I think what that showed the Republicans is they're going to have to reopen to the government and negotiate with the Democrats because at this point, if the shutdown continues to happen and the Democrats had a clean sweep last night across the entire country, you don't want to risk the midterms and losing the House and the Senate. And the longer the government is shut down and the more opportunity Democrats have to pin this on the Republicans, even though Republicans are pling it on pinning it on the Democrats, it just creates more volatility on potentially losing the midterms. And as a result, that would not be good for the party in power.</p>
</details>

所以，也许市场正在消化这样的预期：嘿，这是在提醒所有人，政府必须重新开放。而政府的重新开放可能会成为推动市场不再像以前那样恐慌的顺风。我认为这大概就是目前的情况，但我们稍后会更详细地讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so maybe the market's kind of pricing in, hey, this is a kick in the ass to everybody to say the government's got to reopen and the government reopening could be the tailwind to get the market to not be uh, you know, as scared as it was before. So I think that's kind of what's going on right here, but we'll talk more about it.</p>
</details>

### 选举结果及其对市场的影响

让我们快速从选举结果开始，然后再继续。民主党取得了全面胜利，Mandani 成为了纽约市的新市长。他将于一月份宣誓就职。看到这一切真是令人难以置信。我昨晚看了他的胜选演讲。我必须说，演讲的基调非常自负。客观地说，那不是一种谦逊的、号召团结城市的演讲，而是充满了“我们赢了，这是一个新城市，一种新的政治思维范式”的意味。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we'll just get started real quick on the election results and then we'll keep going from there. Uh again, Democrats had a clean sweep. Mandani is the new mayor of New York City. In January, he will be sworn in as the uh mayor. It was quite incredible to see. I did watch his victory speech last night. I will definitely say the tone of the victory speech was uh very braggadocious. I think objectively it was not one of those humble hey you know let's bring the city together. It was mother effer we won this is a new city this is a new uh paradigm of thinking of politics and quite frankly there was a very strong classfocused message in the speech.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，演讲中带有非常强烈的阶级斗争信息。他引用了过去著名的社会主义者作为论据，我认为这相当惊人。从我看到的许多视频和片段来看，Mandani 更像是一个友善、试图与你交朋友的人。但这次演讲的风格却截然不同，几乎像是在说“我们要推翻资本家阶级”，在某些时刻听起来确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, he was quoting famous socialists of the past as as as references for trying to make the argument that he was making, which I I thought was quite incredible. I mean, I I you know, Mandani from what I've seen in a lot of different videos and clips is more so this like guy who's like nice and just trying to be your friend. This one was like quite literally this one was like we are going to take over the capitalist class and and to an extent it almost literally sounded like that in certain moments.</p>
</details>

我没想到演讲会如此激进。但演讲的主旨是：这是属于工薪阶层的时代。工薪阶层决定朝着一个明确为他们服务的方向前进。现在需要几年的时间来看看是否能取得任何与 Mandani 过去几个月所宣称的雄心相匹配的实际进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I thought that was quite incredible. I didn't expect the speech to be as aggressive as he went for. Uh but the speech was, hey, this is the time for working-class people. Working class people decided to make a decision to go in a direction that is explicitly for them. And now it's going to uh take a few years to see if there's any level of progress that matches the reality or matches the ambition of what Mumdani has been saying over the past couple of months.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，昨晚的选举结果为市场带来了很多明确性。在选举结果公布之前，市场正在下跌。我认为市场只是想要一些确定性。昨晚我们相对迅速地得到了明确的结果，你看到市场开始反弹。当然，这也可能与市场无关，只是算法在选举期间来回交易，造成了一些选举波动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does this mean for the markets? Quite frankly, it added a lot of clarity to the markets last night and and realistically before the uh before the markets or before the elections were called, the markets were dumping. I think the markets just wanted some clarity. I really do. and the fact that we got clarity last night relatively quickly you saw the markets rebounding or it could mean nothing for the markets and it was just convenient that Algo started going back and forth during the election and that was some of the election volatility</p>
</details>

但我不认为这能说明选举的太多问题。归根结底，纽约市长必须与奥尔巴尼的州长合作才能完成任何事情。如果他想实现免费公交、免费医疗、托儿服务或对富人增税，他真的需要与纽约州合作，而不仅仅是纽约市议会，因为后者的权力有限。所以，现在需要几年时间来看看 Mandani 是否能执行他的整体政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh I don't know if it says much about the election at the end of the day the mayor of New York has to govern with the uh or has to work with the governor of Albany to be able to get anything done if he wants to actually get free buses or free healthcare or child care or raise taxes on the rich like you're really going to need to work with New York State not just the New York City state assembly because they don't have that much power and So, it's now going to be a couple years to see if Mumdani can carry out this overall policy.</p>
</details>

一直非常反对 Mandani 的比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）昨天发了一条非常简单的推文：“Mandani，恭喜获胜。现在你责任重大。如果我能在纽约市提供任何帮助，请告诉我我能做什么。”所以，尽管他曾极力反对这个人获胜，但他现在准备好帮助纽约市了。比尔·阿克曼是土生土长的纽约人，他显然热爱这座城市，并希望留在这里，很可能不会搬到迈阿密。这就是阿克曼在这次选举后采取的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Bill Aman, who's been very against Mumani, he tweeted yesterday, 140 characters, very simple. Mumdani, congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help in NYC, just let me know what I can do. So, uh, although he was vehemently against this guy winning, uh, he's ready to help New York City. And, you know, Bill Aman's a native New Yorker. He obviously loves the city. He wants to be in the city. is likely not leaving to Miami. Um, but that is the approach that Aman is taking now based on this election.</p>
</details>

### 关键经济数据：ADP就业报告解析

好的，**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing, Inc.：一家提供人力资源管理软件和服务的公司，其发布的私营部门就业报告是重要的经济先行指标）私营部门就业数据。我们今天早上得到了这个数据。我忘了我们会得到这个数字，但我们还是拿到了。新增就业42,000人，而预期是22,000人。还算不错。这之前，9月份是减少了29,000人。所以劳动力市场在一定程度上呈现出向上的稳定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, private ADP payrolls. We got that this morning. I forgot we were getting this number, but we got it. 42,000 versus 22,000 expected. Not too bad. It follows a 29,000 decline uh in September. So you have some level of stability to the upside in the labor market.</p>
</details>

市场原以为私营部门会增加22,000个工作岗位，但10月份的ADP数据显示我们增加了42,000个。再次强调，9月份我们减少了29,000个。因此，尽管我们没有政府发布的劳动力市场数据，也没有像JOLTS或失业救济申请这样的各种工具，但我们确实有一些第三方数据，这些数据表明情况可能没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The market thought we would add 22,000 jobs on the private payroll uh sector. October ADP showed we added 42,000. Again, we had a 29,000 decline in September. So although we don't have labor market data from the government, we don't have a variety of different tools like jolts or jobless claims from the government. We do have some of this third party data which is signaling that maybe the reports are not as bad.</p>
</details>

ADP报告称，10月份私营部门就业人数增加了42,000人。按行业划分，商品生产部门增加了9,000人，服务提供部门增加了33,000人。问题是，这是否是我们必须适应的新常态？一个相对平淡的数字，因为我们没有劳动力增长。相对于劳动力增长，这是一个好数字吗？我们不知道，因为我们没有失业率数据，也就是家庭调查数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ADP saying that private payrolls grew by 42,000 in the month of October. Uh with a decent split when it comes to by sector goods producing up 9,000, service providing up 33,000. This is a question. Is this the new normal we have to get used to? Is a relatively lackluster number that because we have we don't have the labor force growth. Is this a good number relative to the labor force growth? We don't know because we don't have the unemployment size. What I don't the the the household survey.</p>
</details>

我不喜欢的是我们是如何达到这个数字的。这里有一个令人担忧的地方。员工少于50人的小企业减少了10,000个工作岗位。这已经是他们连续第三个月裁员了。中型企业减少了21,000人，而大型企业（超过500人）才是就业增长的来源。我有一个担忧，从一些轶事来看，这可能是关税效应的潜在影响，小企业受到了伤害，也许在消费层面也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I don't like is how we got here. And this is something that's a a bit of concern here. Small businesses uh less than 50 workers losing 10,000. That is the third month in a row that they have lost workers here. Mediumsize down 21,000 and large over 500. That's where the job gains are. I have a concern anecdotally that this is a potential tariff effect here where small business is being hurt also perhaps at the consumer level. What's going on?</p>
</details>

有些人会说这是“好消息即是坏消息”，因为我们需要降息的原因是劳动力市场正在走弱。所以如果劳动力市场在走强，这难道不会阻碍降息吗？我并不这么认为。这是一个不错的报告，但不是一个惊人的报告。我的意思是，它不是那种“天啊，我们增加了50万个工作岗位”的情况。我们增加了44,000个，而且正如你刚才看到的数据分解，员工少于50人的小企业实际上在裁员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some people are saying is this good news is bad news and the reason you would say it's good news is bad news is because um the reason we need a rate cut is because the labor market is weakening. So if the labor market is strengthening, wouldn't this oppose the ability to get a rate cut? And I don't really think that's the case. This was a good report. This was not a phenomenal report. So what I mean by that is this was not like oh my god we added 500,000 jobs. This is we added 44,000 and as you saw the breakdown right there small businesses less than 50 employees actually lost jobs</p>
</details>

唯一增加就业的是员工超过500人的企业，而小企业终究是国家的支柱。所以，如果小企业处境艰难，很可能因为利率太高而无法承担资本成本，他们就无法继续雇佣员工。如果这种效应在全国范围内持续累积，那么显然劳动力市场会更加疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the only businesses that added jobs were businesses above 500 employees and small businesses at the end of the day at the backbone of the country. So if you do have small businesses that are hurting and likely cannot afford the cost of capital because rates are too high. They can't continue to employ people. If that effect continues to compound across the entire country I mean obviously you're going to get a lot more labor market weakness.</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个不错的报告，因为如果我们得到一个负的就业数据，那将表明我们真的需要降息。我们现在仍然非常需要降息，只是情况不像出现负50万就业岗位那样危急。因为如果是那样，就意味着经济存在根本性问题，降息可能也解决不了，因为降息需要一年时间才能产生任何有意义的影响。所以我认为这是一个不错的报告，不是最好的，也不是最坏的，但足以强化我们将在12月继续看到降息的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, th this was a good report in the fact that if we had a negative jobs number it would signal that we really need a rate cut. We still really need a rate cut. It's just not as dire of a situation as if we had like negative 500,000 jobs because if that's the case then we have an underlying problem in the economy and rate cuts probably are not even going to solve that because you need a year for rate cuts to even have any level of meaningful impact. So I think it was a good report. It was not the best report, not the worst report, but it was enough of a report, I think, to reinforce this argument that we are going to continue to see a December rate cut.</p>
</details>

### 财报季亮点：AMD、Lemonade 及其他公司表现

好的，财报。我们今天有很多财报。首先，让我们快速看一下AMD。在我看来，AMD的财报非常出色。我认为AMD的财报没有任何问题。我们和Jose Neil一起做了直播报道。股价在244美元，下跌了大约2%。收入增长了36%。他们超出了每股收益（EPS）预期。指引也比预期的要强一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, earnings. Let's get into it. So, we had a lot of earnings today. First of all, uh let's just real quick do AMD. AMD crushed it in my opinion. I don't think AMD had a bad earnings. We covered it live with Jose Neil. 244. It's down about 2%. Revenue was up 36%. They beat on EPS. The guide was a bit stronger than expected.</p>
</details>

他们在财报电话会议上被问及关于指引的具体细节，但他们没能提供太多细节，因为他们下周将有一个投资者活动。所以他们把很多信息留到了下周。但总的来说，每股收益超出预期3%，收入超出预期6%。收入同比增长36%，每股收益增长30%。我认为这是一个相当不错的季度，季度本身没有任何值得担忧的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did get questioned on the earnings call on what exactly they can give on terms of details on the guide and they weren't able to really give those details because they're going to have some investor event uh next week. So, they're saving a lot of that information for next week. But overall, 3% beat on EPS, 6% beat on revenue. Revenue is up 36% year-over-year. EPS up 30%. I thought it was a pretty good quarter and I don't think there was anything to be concerned about in the quarter itself.</p>
</details>

我认为任何持有AMD的人都不应该太失望，因为你们的大动作，你们真正的“超级碗”时刻，发生在一个月前，当他们宣布与OpenAI合作时。一旦那个消息宣布，那才是真正的股价驱动因素。如果股价继续上涨，那很好。但如果下跌，考虑到它在一个月内基于与OpenAI的合作关系增加了1000亿美元的市值，而他们甚至还没有从OpenAI获得任何收入，你也不能太不知足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think anyone who's in AMD should be that upset because your big move, your real Super Bowl happened a month ago when they announced the opening eye partnership. Once that was announced, that really was the move. And if it goes higher, that's great. But if it goes lower, I you can't be that ungrateful given it added, you know, 100 billion of market cap in a month based on that OpenAI partnership and they don't even have any revenue from OpenAI.</p>
</details>

现在来看一些其他公司的财报。Lemonade表现非常出色。他们的每股收益超出预期27%，同比增长46%。收入同比增长42%，超出预期5%。恭喜持有Lemonade的各位。这绝对是令人难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's start off with uh some of these companies. Lemonade crushed it. They beat by 27% on EPS. EPS is up 46% year-over-year. Revenue is up 42% year-over-year as they beat revenue by 5%. Congratulations to those who have uh Lemonade. Absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

如果你看一下这张图表，保费增长了30%，客户增长了24%，而他们的总亏损率下降了11%。他们做到这一切的同时，自2022年以来，包括增长在内的运营费用仅增长了10%。所以Lemonade完全配得上他们在盘前市场获得的上涨势头，上涨了70%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look at this chart right here, premiums are up 30%, customers are up 24%, and their gross loss ratio is down 11%. They did all of this while operating expenses included growth of just 10% since 2022. So Lemonade absolutely deserves the uh momentum that they're getting right here in the pre-market up 70%.</p>
</details>

麦当劳的业绩未达预期，每股收益为3.22美元，低于预期的3.33美元，营收为70亿美元，也低于预期的70.9亿美元。营收同比增长3%，但每股收益同比下降。然而，麦当劳的股价实际上是上涨的。我认为他们提到的一个关键点是，同店销售额同比增长了约3%，所以情况并没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">McDonald's, they missed by 3%. 322 versus 333 expected on EPS and then 7.0 over 7.09 on revenue. Revenue is up 3% year-over-year. EPS is down year overyear. McDonald's stock is actually up. So, I don't I didn't hear everything they said in the call or in guidance, but I think I think the one thing they did say was same store sales are up year-over-year by like 3%. So, it's not like that bad.</p>
</details>

Unity也表现出色。他们超出了预期，每股收益为20美分，高于预期的17美分，营收为4.7亿美元，也高于预期的4.53亿美元。营收同比增长5%，每股收益也同比增长5%。这是又一个在营收和利润上都持续超出预期的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unity, they crushed it as well. 18% they beat 20 cents versus 17 cents expected and then 4.70 versus 453 million expected. They beat by 4%. Revenues up 5% year-over-year. EPS is up 5% year-over-year. Again, another name that just continues to beat on the top and the bottom.</p>
</details>

昨天真正遭受重创的一只股票是Axon。我认为这只是因为其估值溢价过高，股价下跌了21%。这家公司主要向警察销售随身摄像头。他们的每股收益未达预期约20%。你知道，他们的股票交易在一个相当激进的估值倍数上。在这种情况下，你不能在每股收益上失手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one stock that got really wrecked yesterday was Axon. And I think this is just because the valuation had too much of a premium focus down 21% right here. These guys sell body cameras primarily at police officers. They missed on EPS by about 20%. And you know, their stock was just trading at a at a pretty aggressive multiple. You can't miss on EPS when it comes to this type of stuff.</p>
</details>

### 政策与地缘政治：特朗普关税案与政府停摆

特朗普总统表示，如果最高法院不支持继续实施关税，这将是这个国家历史上最糟糕的事情。现在让我们来听一些关于此事的报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump has said this would be the worst thing for the history of this country if uh we did not have the tariffs continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court. Here's a little bit of coverage on that and then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

特朗普政府要求最高法院——请记住，特朗普任命了九名大法官中的三名——推翻下级法院的一项裁决。该裁决认为，大部分关税是非法使用《国际经济紧急权力法》的行为。特朗普曾利用该法案实施他所谓的“芬太尼关税”和“解放日关税”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court where remember Trump has appointed three of nine members to reverse a ruling from a lower court that found that most of the tariffs are an illegal use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump has used that law to impose what he called his fentanyl tariffs, his liberation day tariffs earlier this year.</p>
</details>

估计有900亿美元的关税收入悬而未决。财政部表示，如果特朗普政府输掉这场官司，今年很可能需要退还这笔钱。请记住，宪法将征收关税和税收的权力赋予了国会。在特朗普之前，没有哪位总统使用过这项1977年的法律来实施关税。但该法确实允许总统“监管由外国或外国国民拥有的财产的进口”。

<details>
<summary>V/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An estimated $90 billion in tariff revenue hangs on the high court's ruling here. Treasury has said it most likely would have to send that money back this year if the Trump administration is to lose this case. Now remember, the Constitution gives the power to impose tariffs and taxes to Congress. No president before Trump has used this 1977 law to put tariffs in place. But the law does allow a president to quote regulate imports of property owned by a foreign country or foreign national.</p>

白宫表示这足以允许这些关税。但起诉政府的企业认为，监管权与征税权不同，因此关税应被推翻。我们将看看法院对此有何看法。顺便说一下，起诉政府的公司并非你可能预期的大型跨国集团，最初的两起案件是由小公司提起的，包括两家玩具制造商、一家纽约葡萄酒进口商和一家女装公司。

<p class="english-text">Now, the White House says that's enough to allow these tariffs. But the businesses that are suing the administration argue that the power to regulate is not the same as the power to tax and therefore the tariffs should be struck down. We'll see what the court has to say about all this at about 10:00 a.m. this morning. And by the way guys, the companies that are suing the administration here, not the big global conglomerates that you might expect, the two initial cases were brought brought by smaller firms, including two toy manufacturers, a New York wine importer, and a woman's apparel company.</p>

### 市场情绪与长期展望

Evercore ISI的朱利安·伊曼纽尔（Julian Emanuel）表示，尽管以目前的估值持有股票让人感到不安，但AI的故事在不断变好，而且盈利情况也令人难以置信。所以，如果你是那种长期投资者，基本上可以忽略一些市场情绪，坚持持有。

<p class="english-text">Julian Emanuel says. So, this is uh one of my and this is kind of his projections on how this bull market is turning out and what the long-term trend continues to be in place. as uncomfortable as owning stocks at this valuation has been and frankly we want to see it become uncomfortable once again uh you know you look at the AI story it continues to get better um and the earnings are just incredible so it it what you're saying is basically disregard um some sentiment and stay in for the long haul if you're that type of an investor</p>

与我们都喜欢比较的1990年代末不同，在过去几年的牛市中，市场广度一直在扩大，而90年代末的最后几年，市场广度是下降的。因此，过去几周失去这种支撑确实令人担忧。另外，没有人为美元走强做好准备。当这种情况发生时，你往往会遇到其他痛苦的交易。比特币很可能是其中之一。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Right. Well, so and and if you look at this last couple years of bull market, unlike the late 1990s, which we are all fond of comparing it to, you've had market breath expand the entire time, whereas in the late 90s it was declining for those last couple years. And so to sort of lose that prop the last few weeks is certainly a worry. And and to your point earlier, Tim, is nobody is positioned for a stronger dollar. And when that's the case, you tend to have other pain trades. Bitcoin is certainly uh likely to be one of those.</p>

他的核心论点是，盈利强劲。美元走强可能会从其他风险资产交易中抽走一些价值，这些交易本是用来对冲美元持续走强的，比如比特币。看看美元指数，我们现在高于100。过去几个月我们每次看都是在97左右。所以我们今年的跌幅不再是11%那么多了，这可能是我们看到一些风险资产波动的原因，尤其是在比特币上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so his kind of core argument right here is that earnings are strong. you are getting some dollar strength which potentially is taking away some of the value from the other riskon trades that are kind of a hedge against the dollar continuing to get stronger like a bitcoin. I mean look at the dollar right here we're above 100. Every time we've checked this for the past couple months it's been like 97 right? So we are not down 11% for the year as much anymore which could be contributing to why we're seeing some risk on volatility especially in Bitcoin.</p>

在美元上涨和其他交易因此做出反应的短期宏观经济担忧中，你拥有盈利增长。在我们得到英伟达的财报之前，我们无法完全了解盈利的全貌。但根据我们目前看到的盈利情况，似乎很难看空这个市场。Evercore甚至表示，到2026年，标普500指数可能会远超8000点，这仅仅是基于这些公司继续执行、继续表现、继续回购股票，并在AI成为顺风的情况下继续整体提升市场的想法。

<p class="english-text">In the midst of those macroeconomic concerns around kind of the short-term nature of the volatility with the dollar going up and other trades reacting as a result of the of the Dixie going higher, you have earnings growth. And until we get Nvidia, we're not going to fully understand what the earnings picture looks like. But based on the earnings picture we've seen so far, it just seems like it's hard to fade this market. Evercore even said by 2026 we could be pushing well above 8,000 on the S&P 500 just based on the idea that these companies continue to execute, continue to perform, continue to buy back their stock, continue to overall lift the market as AI becomes the tailbone.</p>

### 实时数据冲击：ISM服务业指数发布

好的，我们收到了**ISM**（Institute for Supply Management：美国供应管理协会，其发布的指数是衡量经济活动的重要指标）服务业数据。10月份ISM服务业指数表现强劲，为52.4，远高于预期，比我们上次看到的数字高出2.5个点。这是自今年2月以来的最佳表现，当时为53.5。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We got ISM folks. Let's bring that in for services. October read on ISM services are strong. 52.4 is a headline. Well above expectations, two and a half points above our last look. Sequentially strong, best since Feb of this year when it came in at a strong 53.5.</p>

支付价格指数走错了方向，再次成为收益率上升的原因。指数为70.0，我们预期是68，前值为69.4。这是自22年10月以来的最高支付价格，也就是三年来的高点。新订单指数也远超预期，达到了惊人的56.2，这将是自去年10月以来的最佳表现，创一年新高。就业方面，我们看到ADP数据好于预期，虽然不算特别出色，但这个数据相当稳健，为48.2。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Prices paid moving the wrong way. Another reason yields are going up. 70.0. We're expecting 68 69.4 in the rearview mirror. Highest prices paid since October of 22. Three years. If we look at the new orders, also well above expectations, a wild 56.2. That would be the best going all the way back to October of last year. One-year high there. And on the employment front, and we saw ADP better than expected. Nothing terrific. This is pretty solid. 48.2</p>
</details>

48.2仍处于收缩区间，但好于预期，也好于前值的47.2。48.2将是自5月份以来的最佳表现，当时它最后一次处于扩张区间，为50.7。所以这些都是稳健的数字。我们现在的10年期国债收益率是4.14%，上升了几个基点，正徘徊在10月初以来的一些最高收盘水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">48.2 still in contraction territory, but better than expected. Better than a 47.2 2 in the rear view mirror and 48.2 would be the best since May when it was in expansion territory the last time at 50.7. So these are solid numbers. We're trading 414 now. That's up a handful of basis points as we're hovering with some of the highest closes since early October.</p>

### 盘中动态与个股观察

好的，开盘了。谷歌开盘报278美元，当日上涨0.5%。Palantir再次下跌，昨天曾跌至181美元，现在报189.19美元。所以Palantir开盘走低，但比昨晚的低点有所回升。标普500指数转跌至675点。AMD下跌2%。SoFi报29.59美元，上涨。Grab上涨0.5%，报5.82美元。

今天上午，中国方面有消息称，中国地方政府正在强制中国公司使用国产芯片。他们其实别无选择，因为我们不卖给他们任何芯片。但中国政府正在加大力度，确保华为、腾讯、阿里巴巴、京东等公司继续使用国产芯片，这对英伟达和AMD显然不是好消息。但如果我们本来就不给他们芯片，我不知道这在多大程度上会影响股票的看法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There was a headline this morning from China that said that Chinese state governments are uh forcing Chinese companies to use Chinese chips. They kind of don't have a choice because we're not selling them any chips. But the Chinese government is kind of making it a bigger priority to make sure the Huawei's, the 10 cents, the Babas of the world, the JDs continue to use state manufacturer chips, which obviously is not good for Nvidia AMD, but if we weren't going giving them our chips anyway, then I don't know if it's going to have that much of an impact in terms of the perception of the stock.</p>

我认为接下来的两周市场会更加震荡和盘整。我们在等待英伟达的财报。未来几周除了政府重新开放之外，似乎没有真正的催化剂。当然，政府重新开放是利好消息，但市场会很快消化。除了几周后的英伟达，没有其他重大的财报了。所有真正重要的财报都已经公布。选举也结束了，民主党昨晚在全国大获全胜。Mandani现在是纽约市长。所以，不知道谁会赢的波动性也消失了。

<p class="english-text">I think this is, you know, I think I think this is I think the next two weeks are going to be a little bit more choppy consolidation. We're waiting for Nvidia earnings. Like there's not really a catalyst over the next couple weeks outside of the government reopening, which okay, when that happens, sure, that'll be bullish, but like that'll be priced in relatively soon. Um there's no massive earnings outside of Nvidia in a couple of weeks. Every really important earnings has already happened. The elections are over. Democrats clean sweep across the country last night. Mdani is now the mayor of New York. So that volatility of no of not knowing who's going to win, that's done.</p>

如果你有一个投资论点，并且这个论点没有发生变化，你的投资期限是三到五年，那么几天的剧烈波动并不重要。特别是对于BMR，我昨晚分析过，如果你看五年的图表，以太坊有过几次大幅回调，与我们过去几天经历的非常相似。

<p class="english-text">if you have an investment thesis and something doesn't change in the investment thesis and you have a three to five year outlook, couple of days of strong volatility is not going to matter. And especially with the M&R, I went over it last night. If you look at a five-year chart, there are significant drawdowns on Ethereum that are very similar to what we experienced over the past couple of days.</p>

这就是游戏的一部分，这就是投资的一部分。每个人在分配资本时都知道自己要面对什么。对于Palantir，很多人已经获利颇丰，看到10%或15%的下跌并不是世界上最糟糕的事情，实际上是健康的。而且这个季度的财报表明，他们是我见过的最不可思议的公司之一。

And this quarter signal that they are one of the most incredible companies I have ever seen.</p>

我确实认为，Palantir在发布了绝对碾压性的季度财报后，未能达到225或230美元，他们已经使出了浑身解数。没人真的认为他们能超过60%的增长，但他们实现了63%的同比增长。我认为我们已经达到了一个短期顶部。我认为它会回撤一点，然后横盘整理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do believe that the fact that Palanteer couldn't make it to 225 or 230 after an absolute crushing quarter that they threw the kitchen sink and everything at it. Nobody really thought that they were going to get above 60%. And they got 63% year-over-year growth. I think we've hit a short-term top. I think it's going to retrace a little bit and then I think it's going to go sideways.</p>

现在，如果一年前你和我谈论这个，我认为那些指标真的很疯狂。但今年，我不再认为它们在远期基础上那么疯狂了，仅仅因为我认为收入增长的美元金额在他们的利润率下会增加得如此之多。我认为到2027年，他们可能会有100亿美元的收入。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, before if you talked to me last year about it, I thought that the metrics were really crazy. this year. I don't think they're really crazy anymore on a forward basis only because I think the rate of revenue growth on a dollar amount is going to increase so much at their margins. I think they could be a 10 billion revenue in 2027 at this point.</p>
</details>

也许是2028年。2027年或2028年，我认为他们将成为一家收入100亿美元的公司，产生40到50亿美元的自由现金流。这将使他们进入与其他公司非常相似的领域。如果到2031年左右，他们能达到150或200亿美元的收入，这将是一家能产生100亿美元自由现金流的公司。

<p class="english-text">Maybe maybe 2028. 2027 2028 I think they'll be a 10 billion revenue company generating four to five billion in free cash flow.

And if they can get to 15 or 20 billion revenue by, you know, 2031 or so, this is a company that can do 10 billion dollars of free cash flow.</p>
