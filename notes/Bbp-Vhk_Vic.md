### 选举后的市场动荡与复苏

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是11月5日，星期三，我们正在进行现场直播。进入11月已经几天了，我们有很多事情要讨论。昨天有大量的财报发布，我们会深入探讨。昨天也举行了大量选举，民主党几乎在全国范围内取得了全面胜利，包括纽约市。Zoron（应为Mandani）现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are here and live. It is Wednesday, November 5th. couple days into November and we are live for the open folks. We got a lot of stuff to talk about. We had a ton of earnings yesterday that we are going to get into. We had a ton of elections happen yesterday where the Democrats had pretty much a clean sweep across the entire country including New York City. Zoron is now the mayor of New York. So we have that that took place last night.</p>
</details>

昨晚，如果你在美东时间晚上8:30到9:30左右查看你的投资组合，会发现隔夜市场简直是一场血洗，场面非常难看。我开始收到人们发来的短信，问：“嘿，发生什么事了？为什么跌得这么厉害？”我当时也一无所知。大约到了晚上11点，在大多数选举结果公布后，市场基本收复了失地。虽然没有完全恢复，但已经有了相当程度的反弹，摆脱了那种血洗的惨状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, last night if you were looking at your portfolio in the overnight markets, call it around 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. It was a blood bath. It was ugly. And and like I started getting texts from people like, "Yo, what is happening? Why why is it dumping so bad?" I didn't have any idea. By around 11 p.m. after most of the elections were called, we pretty much recovered. Now, we didn't recover entirely, but there was a decent level of recovery that got rid of the extent of that blood bath.</p>
</details>

在那段时间里，以太坊非常接近跌破3000美元，比特币确实跌破了10万美元。现在以太坊的价格是3350美元，我知道这远不及过去一个月的水平，但至少没有跌破3000美元。比特币也反弹至102,800美元以上，考虑到昨晚曾跌至99,000美元左右，这也不算太糟。所以，如果你昨晚睡得早，没有看自己的投资组合，你就没有目睹那场惨状，现在市场已经有了一些恢复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum was very close to going below 3,000 during that time. Bitcoin did go below 100,000. Uh, and Ethereum right now at 3350, which I know is not near anywhere where it was over the past month, but at least it's not below 3,000. Then Bitcoin right here making a rebound above 102 102.8, which is also not as bad either, uh, given it was at like 99 last night. So, if you just slept early last night and didn't look at your portfolio, you you didn't see some of the the carnage that was happening and now you've had a little bit of more of a recovery.</p>
</details>

我认为，选举前那种不确定性带来的不稳定或波动性已经得到了解决。因此，市场不再那么恐慌，虽然谈不上兴奋，但普遍情绪是“嘿，我们不必那么害怕了”。我对此的初步理论是，民主党昨晚在几乎每个州都取得了压倒性胜利，包括我的家乡新泽西州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh nonetheless, I think some of the instability or volatility of not knowing what would happen in the elections was resolved. And as a result of that, you got a lot more uh not excitement in the markets, but just general like, hey, we don't have to be that afraid. And sort of my my my my working theory around this is that Democrats sweeped last night across pretty much every state uh including my home state, New Jersey.</p>
</details>

我认为这向共和党人表明，他们将不得不重新开放政府并与民主党人谈判。因为到了这个地步，如果政府停摆继续，而民主党昨晚在全国大获全胜，你就不想冒着在中期选举中失去众议院和参议院的风险。政府关门的时间越长，民主党就越有机会把责任归咎于共和党人——尽管共和党人也在把责任推给民主党人——这只会增加在中期选举中失利的波动性。因此，这对于执政党来说不是好事。所以，市场可能正在消化这一点，认为“嘿，这是在提醒所有人，政府必须重新开放”。而政府的重新开放可能成为推动市场不再像以前那样恐慌的顺风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I think what that showed the Republicans is they're going to have to reopen to the government and negotiate with the Democrats because at this point, if the shutdown continues to happen and the Democrats had a clean sweep last night across the entire country, you don't want to risk the midterms and losing the House and the Senate. And the longer the government is shut down and the more opportunity Democrats have to pin this on the Republicans, even though Republicans are pling it on pinning it on the Democrats, it just creates more volatility on potentially losing the midterms. And as a result, that would not be good for the party in power. And so maybe the market's kind of pricing in, hey, this is a kick in the ass to everybody to say the government's got to reopen and the government reopening could be the tailwind to get the market to not be uh, you know, as scared as it was before.</p>
</details>

### 重点公司财报与市场动态扫描

我认为这就是目前正在发生的情况，但我们会进一步讨论。我们有昨天发布的AMD财报，还有SMCI的财报，我们也会谈到。今天早上Lemonade的财报绝对是碾压级的，我们会深入分析。Lemonade股价上涨14%是理所当然的，他们的财报表现确实令人难以置信。我们还有其他一些公司的财报，比如麦当劳等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's kind of what's going on right here, but we'll talk more about it. We got AMD earnings from yesterday. SMCI earnings, we'll talk about that. Lemonade absolutely crushed it this morning. We'll get into that. Lemonade right there deserves to be up 14%. I mean, absolutely incredible. It was absolutely an incredible incredible earnings from Lemonade and so wasn't too bad to kind of see those results. We had a bunch of other earnings. McDonald's etc.</p>
</details>

标普指数微涨，报67585点。SoFi股价上涨，昨晚一度跌破29美元，现在回升至29.81美元以上。Grab股价为5.81美元。英伟达上涨0.5%，昨晚曾跌至190美元左右。Palantir曾跌至181美元。你可以看到许多股票都在反弹。Robinhood今天将发布财报，我会在下午3:30和Roy、Tanner一起直播，这将会是一场重头戏。周一Palantir的财报非常出色，今天轮到Robinhood了，所以这会非常重要。除了Robinhood，还有很多其他公司，我们都会在财报直播中进行报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P slightly green 67585. SoFi right there up. SoFi was like below 29 last night. Now it's above 29.81. Grab right there at 581. Nvidia up half a percent. Nvidia got down to like 190. Palenteer got down to like 181. I mean you're just seeing a bunch of different rebounds. Robin Hood earnings are today. I'll be live at 3:30 with Roy and Tanner. This is going to be a big one today. Uh we had pounder on Monday. They crushed it. Robin Hood is going to be today. So this is going to be a very big one. We got a lot of other companies besides Robin Hood as well. So we'll be covering that all on earnings.</p>
</details>

特斯拉的股东投票将于明天举行。特斯拉股价目前为451美元，上涨了1.5%，表现不错。所以盘前市场是绿色的。这种绿色能否持续？谁知道呢。但至少在昨天之后我们看到了一些绿色。顺便说一下，如果你昨天没有关注市场，你可能没注意到，但加密货币市场有2500亿美元被清算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Tesla, the shareholder vote is tomorrow. Tesla right there at 451. Very nice to see. That's up 1.5%. So you have a green pre-market. Will this green pre-market continue. Who knows? But at least we do have some green after yesterday, which yesterday, by the way. I mean, again, if you just didn't pay attention to the markets yesterday, you probably didn't notice, but $250 billion dollars in the crypto markets were liquidated.</p>
</details>

加密货币市场2500亿美元的清算，显然给各行各业带来了巨大的痛苦。我仍然不知道为什么会有这么大规模的加密货币清算。不知道是因为杠杆，还是人们恐慌性抛售。但如果你看看这个屏幕，所有东西都受到了冲击。所以，今天能有一定程度的恢复，已经令人鼓舞了。但昨天确实是一场血洗。看起来我们正在迎来一些复苏，我们将在今天余下的时间里继续关注财报，看看这种势头能否在本周结束前持续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that $250 billion dollars were liquidated in the crypto markets, obviously that caused a lot of pain across a variety of industries. I still don't know why there was that much crypto liquidation. I don't know if it's leverage, if it's people that were just panic selling, but if you take a look at this this screen right here, everything everything got hit. So, the fact that we're even getting somewhat of recovery today is uh encouraging to see. But yeah, yesterday was a bit of a blood bath. It seems like we're getting a little recovery and we're going to cover the rest of the earnings throughout the day and see if this can continue as we get into the end of this week.</p>
</details>

### 纽约市长选举结果及其影响

好的，我们开始吧。再次感谢大家来到这里。我想我们先快速谈谈选举结果，然后再继续。民主党取得了全面胜利，Mandani成为纽约市新任市长。他将于一月份宣誓就职。看到这一幕真是相当不可思议。我昨晚看了他的胜选演说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started. Again, thank you everybody for being here. I think we'll just get started real quick on the election results and then we'll keep going from there. Uh again, Democrats had a clean sweep. Mandani is the new mayor of New York City. In January, he will be sworn in as the uh mayor. It was quite incredible to see. I did watch his victory speech last night.</p>
</details>

我必须说，胜选演说的基调非常自负。客观地说，那不是那种谦逊的、“让我们团结整个城市”的演讲。而是充满了“我们赢了，这是一个新城市，一种新的政治思维范式”的意味。坦率地说，演讲中带有非常强烈的阶级斗争信息。他引用了过去著名的社会主义者作为论据，我觉得这相当惊人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will definitely say the tone of the victory speech was uh very braggadocious. I think objectively it was not one of those humble hey you know let's bring the city together. It was mother effer we won this is a new city this is a new uh paradigm of thinking of politics and quite frankly there was a very strong classfocused message in the speech. I mean, he was quoting famous socialists of the past as as as references for trying to make the argument that he was making, which I I thought was quite incredible.</p>
</details>

从我看到的许多视频和片段来看，Mandani更像是一个和蔼可亲、试图与你交朋友的人。但这次的演讲简直就像在说“我们要推翻资本家阶级”，在某些时刻听起来几乎就是这个意思。所以我认为这相当不可思议，我没想到他的演讲会如此激进。演讲的核心是，这是工人阶级的时代，工人阶级决定朝着一个明确为他们服务的方向前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I I you know, Mandani from what I've seen in a lot of different videos and clips is more so this like guy who's like nice and just trying to be your friend. This one was like quite literally this one was like we are going to take over the capitalist class and and to an extent it almost literally sounded like that in certain moments. So, I I thought that was quite incredible. I didn't expect the speech to be as aggressive as he went for. Uh but the speech was, hey, this is the time for working-class people. Working class people decided to make a decision to go in a direction that is explicitly for them.</p>
</details>

现在需要几年时间来看看，是否会有任何程度的进展能够匹配Mandani过去几个月所宣称的雄心。以下是人口统计数据。按性别和年龄来看，18至29岁的男性中有68%投给了Mandani，而18至29岁的女性中有84%投给了他。所以我们谈论的是千禧一代的男性和女性。未来几天，我们将获得更多关于种族、性别和人口统计的队列数据，以了解投票的最终情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now it's going to uh take a few years to see if there's any level of progress that matches the reality or matches the ambition of what Mumdani has been saying over the past couple of months. These are the demographics. So if you look at it by gender uh and age, you had men 18 to 29, 68% of them went for Mumani and then women 18 to 29, 84% of them went for Mumani. So you're talking about millennial men and women and we're going to get a lot more cohorts of of race and gender and demographics over the coming days in terms of how the vote ended out.</p>
</details>

如果你当时在看报道，投票结果在五分钟内就揭晓了。首先，纽约市的选举投票率历来很低。这次大约有两百万人投票，这至少是过去几十年来市长选举的记录。两分钟之内，当他们统计完大部分行政区后，布朗克斯区是最后一个。布朗克斯是该市民主党色彩最浓的区。这基本上就是Mandani的胜利了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But dude, the vote was called if you were if you were um looking at the coverage, the vote was called within like five minutes because New York, first of all, there New York is known for historically low election uh voting turnout. So I think two million people voted, which was like a record at least over the past couple decades for these mayoral elections. And within two minutes, as soon as they got most of the burrows, the Bronx was the last burrow. Bronx is the most heavily democratic burrow in the city. It it was Mani's race. It was it.</p>
</details>

我不会说这是一次压倒性的授权，因为Cuomo获得了42%的选票，Mandani大约51%，而Silva大约7%。所以，即使Silva退出，所有选票都流向Cuomo，Cuomo仍然会输，但Mandani的领先优势会缩小到3%或4%，竞争会激烈得多。所以我不会说这是一次全面的授权，不像特朗普在2024年赢得几乎所有摇摆州那样。但无论如何，这是纽约在如何治理自身方面采取了一种全新的思维方式。Mandani现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, I wouldn't say it was a mandate because Cuomo got 42% of it. Mdani had like 51 and then Silva had like seven. So, even if Silva had left and that all that went to Cuomo, Cuomo still would have lost, but it would have been like a 3 or 4% margin by which Mdani would have win. It would have been a lot closer. And so, I wouldn't say it's a full-on mandate uh like Trump had, you know, by winning almost every single swing state in well, literally every single swing state in 2024. But nonetheless, it was New York making an entirely new way of thinking in regards to how they're going to uh govern themselves. And Mandani is now the mayor of New York. So there you go.</p>
</details>

这对市场意味着什么？坦率地说，昨晚它为市场带来了很多清晰度。实际上，在选举结果公布前，市场正在下跌。我认为市场只是想要一些确定性。我真的这么认为。昨晚我们相对迅速地得到了确定性，然后你看到市场反弹。或者，这也可能对市场毫无意义，只是算法在选举期间来回交易，造成了一些选举波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does this mean for the markets? Quite frankly, it added a lot of clarity to the markets last night and and realistically before the uh before the markets or before the elections were called, the markets were dumping. I think the markets just wanted some clarity. I really do. and the fact that we got clarity last night relatively quickly you saw the markets rebounding or it could mean nothing for the markets and it was just convenient that Algo started going back and forth during the election and that was some of the election volatility</p>
</details>

但我不认为这能说明选举的太多问题。归根结底，纽约市长必须与奥尔巴尼的州长合作才能完成任何事情。如果他想真正实现免费公交、免费医疗保健或托儿服务，或者对富人增税，他真的需要与纽约州合作，而不仅仅是纽约市议会，因为后者的权力有限。所以，现在需要几年时间来看看Mandani能否实施他的整体政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh I don't know if it says much about the election at the end of the day the mayor of New York has to govern with the uh or has to work with the governor of Albany to be able to get anything done if he wants to actually get free buses or free healthcare or child care or raise taxes on the rich like you're really going to need to work with New York State not just the New York City state assembly because they don't have that much power and So, it's now going to be a couple years to see if Mumdani can carry out this overall policy.</p>
</details>

一直非常反对Mandani的比尔·阿克曼昨天发了一条非常简单的推文，140个字符：“Mandani，恭喜获胜。现在你责任重大。如果我能在纽约市帮上忙，请告诉我我能做什么。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Bill Aman, who's been very against Mumani, he tweeted yesterday, 140 characters, very simple. Mumdani, congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help in NYC, just let me know what I can do.</p>
</details>

所以，尽管他曾强烈反对这个人获胜，但他现在准备好帮助纽约市了。比尔·阿克曼是土生土长的纽约人，他显然热爱这座城市，想留在这里，很可能不会搬去迈阿密。但这就是阿克曼在这次选举后采取的态度。好了，这就是昨晚发生的事情，市场似乎已经翻篇了。现在我们将转向2026年的中期选举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, although he was vehemently against this guy winning, uh, he's ready to help New York City. And, you know, Bill Aman's a native New Yorker. He obviously loves the city. He wants to be in the city. is likely not leaving to Miami. Um, but that is the approach that Aman is taking now based on this election. So, there you go. That's what we got. That's what happened last night and markets seem to be moving on from it. And now we will move on to midterms going into 2026.</p>
</details>

### ADP就业数据发布与美联储降息展望

好的，**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing: 一家提供人力资源管理服务的公司，其发布的私营部门就业报告是重要的经济指标）私营部门就业报告。我们今天早上得到了这个数据。我忘了我们会得到这个数字，但我们得到了。新增就业42,000人，而预期是22,000人。还算不错。这之前，9月份是减少了29,000人。所以劳动力市场在一定程度上呈现出向上的稳定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, private ADP payrolls. We got that this morning. I forgot we were getting this number, but we got it. 42,000 versus 22,000 expected. Not too bad. It follows a 29,000 decline uh in September. So you have some level of stability to the upside in the labor market.</p>
</details>

市场原以为私营部门会增加22,000个工作岗位，但10月份的ADP数据显示我们增加了42,000个。再次强调，9月份我们减少了29,000个。所以，尽管我们没有政府发布的劳动力市场数据，没有像**JOLTS**（Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey: 职位空缺和劳动力流动调查）或失业救济申请这样的各种工具，但我们确实有一些第三方数据，这些数据表明情况可能没有那么糟糕。让我们来看一些关于这个的报道，然后继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The market thought we would add 22,000 jobs on the private payroll uh sector. October ADP showed we added 42,000. Again, we had a 29,000 decline in September. So although we don't have labor market data from the government, we don't have a variety of different tools like jolts or jobless claims from the government. We do have some of this third party data which is signaling that maybe the reports are not as bad. Let's get a little bit of coverage on this and then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

> ADP私营部门就业数据刚刚出炉。Steve Liesman为我们带来这些数字。
> 数字。多好的想法。太棒了。ADP表示，10月份私营部门就业人数增加了42,000人。按行业划分，分布还算不错：商品生产部门增加9,000人，服务提供部门增加33,000人。问题是，这是否是我们必须习惯的新常态？一个相对平淡的数字，因为我们没有劳动力增长。相对于劳动力增长，这是一个好数字吗？我们不知道，因为我们没有失业规模的数据，也就是家庭调查数据。我不喜欢的是我们是如何达到这个数字的。这有点令人担忧。小企业，即员工少于50人的企业，减少了10,000个工作岗位。这已经是他们连续第三个月裁员了。中型企业减少了21,000人，而大型企业（超过500人）才是就业增长的来源。我有一个担忧，从个案来看，这可能是关税效应的潜在影响，小企业受到了伤害，也许在消费层面也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The ADP private payroll data, it's just out. Steve Leeman joins us with those numbers.
>> Numbers. What a what a what a thought. Fantastic. ADP saying that private payrolls grew by 42,000 in the month of October. Uh with a decent split when it comes to by sector goods producing up 9,000, service providing up 33,000. This is a question. Is this the new normal we have to get used to? Is a relatively lackluster number that because we have we don't have the labor force growth. Is this a good number relative to the labor force growth? We don't know because we don't have the unemployment size. What I don't the the the household survey. What I don't like is how we got here. And this is something that's a a bit of concern here. Small businesses uh less than 50 workers losing 10,000. That is the third month in a row that they have lost workers here. Mediumsize down 21,000 and large over 500. That's where the job gains are. I have a concern anecdotally that this is a potential tariff effect here where small business is being hurt also perhaps at the consumer level. What's going on? Look,</p>
</details>

这就是就业报告。现在，有人说这是好消息还是坏消息。你会说好消息是坏消息的原因是，我们需要降息是因为劳动力市场正在走弱。所以如果劳动力市场在走强，这难道不会阻碍降息吗？我并不这么认为。这是一份不错的报告，但不是一份惊人的报告。我的意思是，这不像“天哪，我们增加了50万个工作岗位”。我们增加了44,000个，而且正如你看到的细分数据，员工少于50人的小企业实际上在裁员，唯一增加就业的是员工超过500人的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so that's the jobs report. Now again, uh some people are saying is this good news is bad news and the reason you would say it's good news is bad news is because um the reason we need a rate cut is because the labor market is weakening. So if the labor market is strengthening, wouldn't this oppose the ability to get a rate cut? And I don't really think that's the case. This was a good report. This was not a phenomenal report. So what I mean by that is this was not like oh my god we added 500,000 jobs. This is we added 44,000 and as you saw the breakdown right there small businesses less than 50 employees actually lost jobs and the only businesses that added jobs were businesses above 500 employees</p>
</details>

归根结底，小企业是国家的支柱。所以如果小企业处境艰难，很可能因为利率太高而无法承担资本成本，他们就无法继续雇佣员工。如果这种效应在全国范围内持续累积，那么很明显，劳动力市场将会更加疲软。所以这是一份不错的报告，因为如果我们得到一个负的就业数字，那将表明我们真的需要降息。我们仍然非常需要降息，只是情况不像我们出现负50万个工作岗位那么危急。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and small businesses at the end of the day at the backbone of the country. So if you do have small businesses that are hurting and likely cannot afford the cost of capital because rates are too high. They can't continue to employ people. If that effect continues to compound across the entire country I mean obviously you're going to get a lot more labor market weakness. So th this was a good report in the fact that if we had a negative jobs number it would signal that we really need a rate cut. We still really need a rate cut. It's just not as dire of a situation as if we had like negative 500,000 jobs</p>
</details>

因为如果是那样的话，就意味着我们的经济存在根本性问题，降息可能都无法解决，因为降息需要一年时间才能产生任何有意义的影响。所以我认为这是一份不错的报告，不是最好的，也不是最坏的，但我认为这份报告足以强化我们将继续看到12月降息的论点。尽管鲍威尔和美联储想表现出尽可能多的谨慎，我们很可能会在12月迎来降息，并且继续降息非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because if that's the case then we have an underlying problem in the economy and rate cuts probably are not even going to solve that because you need a year for rate cuts to even have any level of meaningful impact. So I think it was a good report. It was not the best report, not the worst report, but it was enough of a report, I think, to reinforce this argument that we are going to continue to see a December rate cut. Even though JPO and the Fed want to signal as much caution as they can, we're likely getting that December cut and it is important that we continue to get that cut.</p>
</details>

### 重点公司财报深度解析

好的，财报。我们今天有很多财报。首先，让我们快速看一下AMD。在我看来，AMD的财报非常出色。我不认为AMD的财报有什么问题。我们和Jose Neil一起直播报道了。股价244美元，下跌了约2%。收入增长了36%。**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）超出预期。指引比预期要强一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, earnings. Let's get into it. So, we had a lot of earnings today. First of all, uh let's just real quick do AMD. AMD crushed it in my opinion. I don't think AMD had a bad earnings. We covered it live with Jose Neil. 244. It's down about 2%. Revenue was up 36%. They beat on EPS. The guide was a bit stronger than expected.</p>
</details>

他们在财报电话会议上被问及指引的具体细节，但他们未能提供，因为下周将有一个投资者活动，他们把很多信息留到了下周。但总的来说，EPS超出预期3%，收入超出预期6%。收入同比增长36%，EPS增长30%。我认为这是一个相当不错的季度，季度本身没有任何值得担忧的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did get questioned on the earnings call on what exactly they can give on terms of details on the guide and they weren't able to really give those details because they're going to have some investor event uh next week. So, they're saving a lot of that information for next week. But overall, 3% beat on EPS, 6% beat on revenue. Revenue is up 36% year-over-year. EPS up 30%. I thought it was a pretty good quarter and I don't think there was anything to be concerned about in the quarter itself.</p>
</details>

它不像甲骨文的拉里·埃里森那样，**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligations: 剩余履约义务，预测未来收入的关键指标）增长了三四百个百分点。所以他们有点把甲骨文和OpenAI的指引算进去了，但没有真正展示很多数字。因为如果他们真的展示了，他们给出的收入指引至少会是354%，但他们给出的指引是大约25%，这是合理的。这远好于他们上个季度14%的数据中心收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It wasn't some massive uh Larry Ellison Oracle type of RPO growth that was up like 3 400%. So they're kind of baking in the the Oracle the open eye guidance but not legitimately showing uh a lot of those numbers because if they were to legitimately show you know they'd be guiding for revenues of minimum of like 354% but they're guiding for about 25% which is reasonable. It's way better than the 14% data center revenues that they had uh last quarter.</p>
</details>

所以，现在股价相对平稳。再次强调，在宣布与OpenAI合作后，股价从150美元涨到了250美元，所以现在波动不大了。Palantir也是一样，对吧？经历了大涨之后，与几周前相比，股价相对平稳。所以我认为持有AMD的人不应该太沮丧，因为你们真正的超级碗在一个月前就发生了，当时他们宣布了与OpenAI的合作。一旦宣布，那才是真正的大动作。如果股价再涨，那很好。但如果下跌，考虑到它在一个月内基于与OpenAI的合作增加了1000亿美元的市值，而他们甚至还没有从OpenAI获得任何收入，你也不能太不知足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, the stock is relatively flat now. Again, the stock moved from 150 to 250 after that opening ideal. So, it's not moving that much anymore. Same thing with Palanteer, right? Made a big move. It's relatively flat compared to where it was a couple weeks ago. So, I don't think anyone who's in AMD should be that upset because your big move, your real Super Bowl happened a month ago when they announced the opening eye partnership. Once that was announced, that really was the move. And if it goes higher, that's great. But if it goes lower, I you can't be that ungrateful given it added, you know, 100 billion of market cap in a month based on that OpenAI partnership and they don't even have any revenue from OpenAI.</p>

CrowdStrike和CoreWeave宣布了一项全球合作伙伴关系，旨在为“代理时代”（Agentic Era）打造安全的AI云基础，并加速实现安全的**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能）。这个标题里的时髦词汇真是太多了。代理时代，安全AGI。天哪。好吧，让我们看看CrowdStrike的股价是否上涨。没有，CrowdStrike股价平平。CoreWeave涨了一点。

今天早上我们有哪些财报？如果你们持有这些股票，请告诉我。我们先从一些公司开始。Lemonade的财报非常出色。他们的EPS超出预期27%，同比增长46%。收入同比增长42%，超出预期5%。恭喜持有Lemonade的各位。这绝对是令人难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do we have? Let me know if anyone owns any of these names. So, let's start off with uh some of these companies. Lemonade crushed it. They beat by 27% on EPS. EPS is up 46% year-over-year. Revenue is up 42% year-over-year as they beat revenue by 5%. Congratulations to those who have uh Lemonade. Absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

如果你看这张图表，保费增长了30%，客户增长了24%，而他们的综合赔付率下降了11%。他们做到这一切的同时，自2022年以来，包括增长在内的运营费用仅增长了10%。所以Lemonade在盘前市场获得的势头是完全应得的，上涨了70%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look at this chart right here, premiums are up 30%, customers are up 24%, and their gross loss ratio is down 11%. They did all of this while operating expenses included growth of just 10% since 2022. So Lemonade absolutely deserves the uh momentum that they're getting right here in the pre-market up 70%.</p>
</details>

麦当劳，他们EPS未达预期3%，为3.22美元，预期为3.33美元；收入为70亿美元，预期为70.9亿美元。收入同比增长3%，EPS同比下降。麦当劳的股票实际上是上涨的。我没有听到他们在电话会议或指引中说的所有内容，但我认为他们确实说了一件事，那就是同店销售额同比增长了约3%。所以情况并没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">McDonald's, they missed by 3%. 322 versus 333 expected on EPS and then 7.0 over 7.09 on revenue. Revenue is up 3% year-over-year. EPS is down year overyear. McDonald's stock is actually up. So, I don't I didn't hear everything they said in the call or in a guidance, but I think I think the one thing they did say was same store sales are up year-over-year by like 3%. So, it's not like that bad.</p>
</details>

Unity，他们的财报也非常好。超出预期18%，每股收益20美分，预期17美分；收入4.7亿美元，预期4.53亿美元。他们超出预期4%。收入同比增长5%，每股收益同比增长5%。又一个在营收和利润上都持续超出预期的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unity, they crushed it as well. 18% they beat 20 cents versus 17 cents expected and then 4.70 versus 453 million expected. They beat by 4%. Revenues up 5% year-over-year. EPS is up 5% year-over-year. Again, another name that just continues to beat on the top and the bottom.</p>
</details>

SolarEdge，他们也超出了预期。每股亏损31美分，预期亏损42美分；收入3.4亿美元，预期3.36亿美元。他们超出预期1%，EPS超出预期26%。收入同比增长44%，EPS增长98%。我们知道几周前Enphase的财报受到了冲击。SolarEdge股价下跌了6%。即使在营收和利润都表现出色的情况下，太阳能股在过去两年里确实表现不佳。

<p class="english-text">Solar Edge, uh, they beat as well. Negative 31 cents versus 42 cents, 340 versus 336. They beat by 1%, 26% beat on EPS. Revenues up 44% year-over-year. EPS is up 98%. Now, we know that Nphase got hit a couple weeks ago on their earnings. Solar Edge is down 6%. Even with a pretty good beat on the top and the bottom, the solar stocks realistically for the past two years have just not been where you want it to be</p>
</details>

昨天我们还有SMCI的财报。我不知道为什么SMCI跌得那么惨，但他们确实未达预期。但就像他们两周前给出的初步结果一样，已经告诉你他们会未达预期，而分析师们仍然对他们未达预期感到失望，所以股价下跌了。SMCI是一只非常波动的股票，在公布这些数据后下跌了约8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we did have SMCI yesterday. I don't know why SMCI got as crushed as it did, but uh they missed. But it's kind of like the preliminary results they gave two weeks ago were telling you they were going to miss and analysts were still upset that they missed and so stock went down. So SMCI right here a very volatile stock 4360 that's down about 8% after those numbers.</p>
</details>

昨天真正受到重创的一只股票是Axon。我认为这只是因为估值溢价太高了，股价下跌了21%。这些公司主要向警察销售执法记录仪。他们的EPS未达预期约20%。而且他们的股票交易倍数相当激进。在这种情况下，你不能在EPS上失手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one stock that got really wrecked yesterday was Axon. And I think this is just because the valuation had too much of a premium focus down 21% right here. These guys sell body cameras primarily at police officers. They missed on EPS by about 20%. And you know, their stock was just trading at a at a pretty aggressive multiple. You can't miss on EPS when it comes to this type of stuff.</p>

### 宏观经济与政策动态

让我们谈谈关税，因为今天最高法院将正式开始审理对特朗普政府关税政策的挑战。特朗普曾表示，如果最高法院不支持继续实施关税，这将是这个国家历史上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's talk about tariffs because today is officially the day that the Supreme Court is going to start hearing the challenges to the Trump administration's tariff policy. Trump has said this would be the worst thing for the history of this country if uh we did not have the tariffs continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
</details>

> 特朗普政府要求最高法院——请记住，特朗普任命了九名大法官中的三名——推翻下级法院的一项裁决，该裁决认定大部分关税是非法使用《国际经济紧急权力法》。特朗普利用该法案实施了他所谓的“芬太尼关税”和“解放日关税”。估计有900亿美元的关税收入悬而未决。财政部表示，如果特朗普政府输掉这场官司，今年很可能不得不退还这笔钱。请记住，宪法将征收关税和税收的权力赋予了国会。在特朗普之前，没有总统使用过这部1977年的法律来实施关税。但该法确实允许总统“监管由外国或外国国民拥有的财产的进口”。现在，白宫表示这足以允许这些关税。但起诉政府的企业认为，监管的权力与征税的权力不同，因此关税应被推翻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court where remember Trump has appointed three of nine members to reverse a ruling from a lower court that found that most of the tariffs are an illegal use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump has used that law to impose what he called his fentanyl tariffs, his liberation day tariffs earlier this year. An estimated $90 billion in tariff revenue hangs on the high court's ruling here. Treasury has said it most likely would have to send that money back this year if the Trump administration is to lose this case. Now remember, the Constitution gives the power to impose tariffs and taxes to Congress. No president before Trump has used this 1977 law to put tariffs in place. But the law does allow a president to quote regulate imports of property owned by a foreign country or foreign national. Now, the White House says that's enough to allow these tariffs. But the a business that are suing the administration argue that the power to regulate is not the same as the power to tax and therefore the tariffs should be struck down.</p>
</details>

这里的细微之处在于，这个案子将在1月份做出裁决。今天将进行听证，但他们未来几个月内不会做出决定。如果他们做出不利于特朗普关税的裁决——我真的不认为会发生，考虑到最高法院的构成——特朗普政府已经表示，他们80%到90%的关税将通过一些后门漏洞来实施，以便他们能够绕过障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the the nuance to this is that this will be decided in January. It's going to be heard today, but uh they're not going to make a decision for the next couple months. And if they were to go against Trump's tariffs, which I I really don't think is going to happen just given the the making of the Supreme Court, um the Trump administration has said they have 80 to 90% of their tariffs are going to be covered in like some backdoor loopholes for them to be able to navigate uh how they're going to be able to implement the tariffs.</p>

### 市场情绪与长期展望

BMR股价下跌，这让人们很恼火。BMR跌至38美元。对于任何持有BMR的人来说，情况都很糟糕。有人称Tom Lee是骗子，说他躲起来了，要离开这个国家等等。他呢，你知道，调整了他的领英资料，说他现在在麦当劳工作。向Tom Lee致敬，他像个冠军一样接受了这一切，只是对此一笑置之，还开了些玩笑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">BMR, this one really got people annoyed yesterday. BMR fell to $38. It was ugly out there for anyone who owns BMR. You got people calling Tom Lee a scam and saying he's hiding. He's leaving the country. Yada yada. You got him, you know, readjusting his McDonald's or his LinkedIn profile to say that he now works at McDonald's, which shout out to Tom Lee. He's taking it like a champ and he's just uh he's just laughing about it and uh making some jokes.</p>
</details>

这张图表我觉得也很有趣。这是Ryan Dietrich发布的。AI投资者情绪调查显示，2025年看涨者减去看跌者的比例为负11%。历史上只有三次这个数字低于负10%，而且都发生在熊市中：1990年、2008年和2022年。令人难以置信的是，根据这项调查，2008年看跌者比看涨者多11.1%，与2025年的水平完全相同。我们在2025年正处于牛市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This chart I thought was really interesting as well. This is supposed by Ryan Dietrich. Uh the AI survey, bulls minus bears, is negative 11% in 2025. Only three other times has this ever been negative 10% and they all happened in bare markets. 1990, 2008, and 2022. Incredibly, bears outnumber bulls by 11.1% based on this survey in 2008, the exact same level as 2025. We are in a bull market in 2025.</p>
</details>

但根据AI投资者调查——Tom Lee多次提到这是衡量广大股市中人们是看涨还是看跌的最重要调查之一——你看到的看跌情绪读数与2008年我们经历大衰退时相同，这有点疯狂，因为我们并没有处于衰退中，失业率在4.3%。公司们正公布惊人的财报。所以，我认为这确实说明了这是有史以来最被讨厌的牛市，最被讨厌的V型反转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But based on the AI investor survey, which Tom Le has talked about many times is one of the most important surveys to get a gauge on if people are bullish or bearish in the broader stock market, you have the same reading of bearishness as you had in 2008 when we had the great recession, which is kind of crazy, dude, because we're not in a recession unless you know unemployment's at 4.3%. You know, like or the companies are putting up phenomenal earnings. So, it's one of those things that I think really does speak to this most hated bare bull market ever, most hated V-shape.</p>

> 他的核心论点是，财报强劲。美元走强，这可能从其他风险交易中吸走了一些价值，这些交易本是对冲美元持续走强的工具，比如比特币。看看美元指数，我们现在高于100。过去几个月我们每次看它时，它都在97左右。所以我们今年不再下跌11%那么多了，这可能是我们看到一些风险资产波动的原因之一，尤其是在比特币上。
> 在这些宏观经济担忧中，比如美元上涨和其他交易因此做出反应的短期波动性，我们看到了盈利增长。在英伟达公布财报之前，我们无法完全了解盈利的全貌。但根据我们目前看到的盈利情况，似乎很难看空这个市场。Evercore甚至表示，到2026年，标普500指数可能会远超8000点，仅仅基于这些公司继续执行、继续表现、继续回购股票，随着AI成为顺风，继续整体提振市场的想法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> so his kind of core argument right here is that earnings are strong. you are getting some dollar strength which potentially is taking away some of the value from the other riskon trades that are kind of a hedge against the dollar continuing to get stronger like a bitcoin. I mean look at the dollar right here we're above 100. Every time we've checked this for the past couple months it's been like 97 right? So we are not down 11% for the year as much anymore which could be contributing to why we're seeing some risk on volatility especially in Bitcoin.
>> In the midst of those macroeconomic concerns around kind of the short-term nature of the volatility with the dollar going up and other trades reacting as a result of the of the Dixie going higher, you have earnings growth. And until we get Nvidia, we're not going to fully understand what the earnings picture looks like. But based on the earnings picture we've seen so far, it just seems like it's hard to fade this market. Evercore even said by 2026 we could be pushing well above 8,000 on the S&P 500 just based on the idea that these companies continue to execute, continue to perform, continue to buy back their stock, continue to overall lift the market as AI becomes the tailbone.</p>

### 开盘直击与个股动态

好了，我们开盘了。谷歌开盘报278美元，当日上涨0.5%。Palantir再次下跌。昨天Palantir曾跌至181美元，现在是189.19美元。所以Palantir开盘下跌，但比昨晚的低点有所回升。标普500指数转跌，报675点。AMD下跌2%。SoFi报29.59美元，上涨。Grab上涨0.5%，报5.82美元。谷歌278美元。Robinhood上涨1.7%，昨晚曾跌至130美元。所以昨晚对很多股票来说都相当激进，但它正在恢复，试图回到140美元。

Grab right there up half a percent that's at 582. Google 278. Robin Hood 1.7%. Robin Hood got to 130 last night.

今早有来自中国的头条新闻称，中国政府正在强制中国公司使用中国芯片。他们其实别无选择，因为我们不卖给他们任何芯片。但中国政府正在加大力度，确保华为、腾讯、阿里巴巴、京东等公司继续使用国产芯片，这显然对英伟达和AMD不利。但如果我们本来就不给他们芯片，那么我不知道这会对股票的看法产生多大影响。

<p class="english-text">There was a headline this morning from China that said that Chinese state governments are uh forcing Chinese companies to use Chinese chips. They kind of don't have a choice because we're not selling them any chips. But the Chinese government is kind of making it a bigger priority to make sure the Huawei's, the 10 cents, the Babas of the world, the JDs continue to use state manufacturer chips, which obviously is not good for Nvidia AMD, but if we weren't going giving them our chips anyway, then I don't know if it's going to have that much of an impact in terms of the perception of the stock.</p>
</details>

我认为接下来的两周会是比较震荡的盘整期。我们在等待英伟达的财报。未来几周除了政府重新开放外，似乎没有真正的催化剂。好吧，当那发生时，当然是利好，但那会很快被市场消化。除了几周后的英伟达，没有其他重要的财报了。所有真正重要的财报都已经公布。选举也结束了，民主党昨晚在全国大获全胜。Mandani现在是纽约市长。所以那种不知道谁会赢的波动性已经消失了。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, you're seeing pretty much everything go red.

Like there's not really a catalyst over the next couple weeks outside of the government reopening, which okay, when that happens, sure, that'll be bullish, but like that'll be priced in relatively soon. Um there's no massive earnings outside of Nvidia in a couple of weeks. Every really important earnings has already happened. The elections are over. Democrats clean sweep across the country last night. Mdani is now the mayor of New York. So that volatility of no of not knowing who's going to win, that's done.</p>

### 嘉宾连线：深度解读Palantir财报

> **Steve:** 如果你有一个投资论点，而这个投资论点没有发生任何变化，并且你有一个三到五年的展望，几天的剧烈波动是无关紧要的。特别是对于BMR，我昨晚分析过。如果你看五年的图表，以太坊有几次大幅回调，与我们过去几天经历的非常相似。
> **Amit:** 是的。
> **Steve:** 这是游戏的一部分，是投资的一部分。每个人在分配资本时都知道自己要面对什么。至于Palantir，很多人在这上面赚了很多钱。看到10%或15%的下跌并不是世界上最糟糕的事情。这实际上是健康的。这个季度表明，他们是我见过的最不可思议的公司之一。
> **Amit:** 我想听听你对这个季度的初步看法。
> **Steve:** 我不知道还有哪家公司能做到他们所做到的，除了英伟达。这与英伟达在2024年所取得的成就非常相似。我得说，我认为人们不理解未来两到三年将会出现的S曲线。

> **Steve:** 我确实相信，Palantir在发布了一个绝对碾压级的季度财报后，股价未能达到225或230美元，这意味着我们已经达到了一个短期顶部。我认为它会回撤一点，然后横盘整理。我认为那些分析师给出的60美元的看跌目标价合理吗？不，我不这么认为。
> **Amit:** 你知道，我们的朋友Richie昨天把我们的目标价从45美元上调到了50美元。
> **Steve:** 哦，看吧。45到50。我认为那不太现实。但如果它跌到150美元，横盘整理一段时间，然后在消化估值的过程中再次开始升值，我认为这完全有可能。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I do believe that the fact that Palanteer couldn't make it to 225 or 230 after an absolute crushing quarter that they threw the kitchen sink and everything at it.

Do I think that these analyst expectations or bearish analyst price targets of $60 is reasonable? No, I don't.
>> Well, you know, you know, you know, our boy Richishy upgraded us from 45 to 50 yesterday.

### 最新经济数据及其市场反应

好的，我们有利率服务业的数据。
> 回到Rick Santelli。嗨，Rick。这又是另一回事了。你看到收益率飙升。这是因为以下数据点。10月份的ISM服务业数据强劲。总体指数为52.4，远高于预期，比我们上次的数据高出2.5个点。环比强劲，是今年2月以来最好的，当时是强劲的53.5。支付价格走错了方向。这是收益率上升的另一个原因。70.0。我们预期是68，之前是69.4。这是自22年10月以来的最高支付价格。新订单也远高于预期，高达56.2。这将是去年10月以来的最好水平，创一年新高。在就业方面，我们看到ADP好于预期。没什么了不起的。这个数据相当稳健。48.2，仍在收缩区间，但好于预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We got ISM folks. Let's bring that in for services.
>> Back to Rick Santelli. Hi again, Rick. Hi Car. Well, this is a different story. You see yield zoom zoom zooming. That's because of the following data points. October read on ISM services are strong. 52.4 is a headline. Well above expectations, two and a half points above our last look. Sequentially strong, best since Feb of this year when it came in at a strong 53.5. Prices paid moving the wrong way. Another reason yields are going up. 70.0. We're expecting 68 69.4 in the rearview mirror. Highest prices paid since October of 22. Three years. If we look at the new orders, also well above expectations, a wild 56.2. That would be the best going all the way back to October of last year. One-year high there. And on the employment front, and we saw ADP better than expected. Nothing terrific. This is pretty solid. 48.2 48.2 still in contraction territory, but better than expected.</p>
</details>

好的，市场正试图消化这些ISM数据。正如你所看到的，10年期国债收益率正在大幅攀升，达到4.1%，我认为这不一定是好事，但也不是特别糟糕。降息的轨迹甚至比预期的要好。早上是69%，现在是70.1%。所以更多的人仍然相信我们会降息。所以这并没有降低降息的概率。然后美元指数仍然在100。我想市场上涨是因为人们在卖出债券，买入股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so market's trying to grapple with some of this uh ISM stuff. And as you can see right here, 10 years are creeping much higher, 4.1, which I don't think is necessarily good, but it's also not horrible. The the rate cut trajectory is even better than expected. I mean, it was 69% in the morning. Now it's 70.1%. So you have more people still believing that we're going to get a cut. So it's not like this is pushing the probabilities of a cut down. And then the Dixie still at 100. And then I guess the market's up because look at that S&P high of day. I guess the market's up because people are selling bonds and buying stocks.</p>

> 是的，还有其他选择，你昨天在CNBC上听到财政部长Bessent说他们有应急计划。他们可以做其他事情，但那些事情更麻烦。政府喜欢它一直在使用的IEPA程序的原因是，它几乎是直接的总统权力。他不必经过漫长的调查过程。他不必通知国会并做所有这些其他程序性的事情，而这些是在某些替代方案下他必须做的。所以，总统喜欢的是那种直接且即时的关税能力，对关税可以多高没有上限，对何时实施也没有时间表。如果这被推翻，那将真正限制他未来在关税方面的回旋余地。但你说得对，他们会尝试用这些其他程序有效地重新实施这些关税，达到相同的水平。这可能会很麻烦，但他们可能能做到。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, there are other options and you heard uh Treasury Secretary Besson say on CNBC yesterday that they've got contingency plans. There are other things that they can do, but those things are more cumbersome. The reason the administration likes uh the IEPA procedure that it's been using is because it's pretty much direct presidential authorities. He doesn't have to go through a long investigation process. He doesn't have to notify Congress and do all these other procedural things that he would have to do under some of these alternatives. So, uh what the president likes is that immediate and direct ability to tariff with no caps on how high he can go on the tariffs and no timeline for when he can put those into place. If that's struck down, that really limits his maneuvering room on tariffs going forward. But you're right, they would try to reimpose these tariffs effectively at the same levels with these other procedures. It might be cumbersome, but they could probably do it.</p>

这再次意味着，无论最高法院如何裁决，你可能都不会对关税产生太大影响。标普500指数报677.59点。其他股票大多上涨。谷歌报284.71美元。

<p class="english-text">>> Which also means again, no matter how the Supreme Court rules, you might not have that much of an impact on the tariffs. S&P 500 right there is 67759. Everything else relatively green. Google right there 28471 on the day.</p>

> 是的，所以很难把握经济的信号。
> 我认为这是最重要的一点。很难把握经济的信号，我们得到的任何可能看跌或看涨的数据，市场都会立即做出下意识的反应。顺便说一下，昨天美国航空公司有一些裁员。所以你开始更多地听到这些问题，你知道，高管层是否在说，“嘿，我们需要裁员，而且我们要在管理层裁员，而不是蓝领阶层。”

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, it's it's it's really hard to get the signal on the economy services.
>> I think that's the big thing. It's hard to get the signal on the economy and whatever piece of a data we get that could be either bearish or bullish, you get a knee-jerk reaction immediately by the market. By the way, we had some corporate layoffs yesterday with American Airlines. So you are starting to get a little bit more of those questions around, you know, are is is our seauite essentially saying, "Hey, we need to cut workers and you know, we're going to cut them in the managerial class versus in the blue collar class."</p>

我爱AMD，但我不认为MI450会成为每个超级计算机的首选芯片，这些公司正投入数十亿美元给所有这些新兴云服务商来建设数据中心。而且，顺便说一句，如果英伟达失败了，AMD也会跟着失败。这不像，你知道，这些东西是同步变动的。现在，如果一个增长比另一个快，它们显然会分化，但如果人们不买Blackwell，他们凭什么会买MI450？

<p class="english-text">I I love AMD, but I don't think the MI450 is going to be uh the chip of choice for every single hyperscaler that is giving billions and billions of dollars to all these neo clouds to build data centers for. And also, by the way, if Nvidia fails, AMD is failing with it. Like, this is not some like, you know, this is these things move in tandem with each other. Now, obviously they they diverge if one is growing faster than the other, but if people aren't buying Blackwell, why the hell would they buy the MI450?</p>

对我来说，AMD更多的是对英伟达的补充，而不是一个独立的选项，除非AMD能推出一款完全优于英伟达任何产品的芯片。我不认为我们已经看到了很多这方面的证据。但重点是，即使你不持有英伟达，而在持有像Nebius这样的公司，心理上看多英伟达也是可以的。但你必须对自己诚实，很多这类投资都依赖于这场AI革命的持续。

<p class="english-text">Like, it's like AMD to me is more accretive than uh than a separate option from Nvidia, unless AMD comes out with a chip that's just supremely better than anything Nvidia can come out with. And I don't think we've necessarily seen a ton of evidence on that. But but the point is it's okay to be uh psychologically long invidia even if you're not long in Nvidia and you're long like a Nebus. But but you do have to be honest with yourself like a lot of this stuff just depends on this AI revolution being intact.</p>

我真的不知道。我明白股价从210美元跌到了183美元。但猜猜怎么着？210美元时它很贵，183美元时它也很贵。而这只股票在一月份时才60美元。所以，任何抱怨20美元下跌的人，我不知道。我认为在那个时候，你太执着于股价，而没有真正关注这个季度基本面发生了什么。你也没有看到这样一个现实，即这家公司市值4340亿美元，而他们的收入大约是45亿美元。

<p class="english-text">I just don't I I really don't just don't. I understand the stock was at 210, now it's at 183. Guess what? At 210 it was expensive. At 183, it's expensive. And the stock was at 60 in January. So, it's like anyone complaining about a $20 move to the downside is just not I don't know. I I think I think at that point you're way too obsessed with the stock price and not really looking at the fundamentals of what happened at the quarter. You're also not looking at the reality of the fact that this company is worth 434 billion and they're doing about 4.5 billion in revenue.</p>
