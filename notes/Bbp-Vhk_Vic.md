### 市场概览：选举后的剧烈波动与复苏

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是11月5日，星期三。我们有很多事情要讨论，昨天有大量的财报发布，我们稍后会深入探讨。昨天还举行了大量选举，民主党几乎在全国范围内取得了全面胜利，包括纽约市。Zoron现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are here and live. It is Wednesday, November 5th. A couple days into November and we are live for the open folks. We got a lot of stuff to talk about. We had a ton of earnings yesterday that we are going to get into. We had a ton of elections happen yesterday where the Democrats had pretty much a clean sweep across the entire country including New York City. Zoron is now the mayor of New York. So we have that that took place last night.</p>
</details>

如果你昨晚在盘后市场查看你的投资组合，大约在晚上8:30到9:30之间，那简直是一场血洗，场面非常难看。我开始收到人们发来的短信，问：“嘿，发生什么了？为什么跌得这么惨？”我当时也一无所知。大约到晚上11点，在大多数选举结果公布后，市场基本恢复了。虽然没有完全恢复，但已经有了相当程度的反弹，摆脱了那种血洗的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, last night if you were looking at your portfolio in the overnight markets, call it around 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. It was a blood bath. It was ugly. And I started getting texts from people like, "Yo, what is happening? Why is it dumping so bad?" I didn't have any idea. By around 11 p.m. after most of the elections were called, we pretty much recovered. Now, we didn't recover entirely, but there was a decent level of recovery that got rid of the extent of that blood bath.</p>
</details>

在那段时间，以太坊非常接近跌破3000美元，比特币确实跌破了10万美元。现在以太坊的价格是3350美元，我知道这远不及过去一个月的水平，但至少没有跌破3000美元。比特币也反弹至102,800美元以上，考虑到昨晚曾跌至99,000美元左右，这也不算太糟。所以，如果你昨晚睡得早，没有看投资组合，你就没有看到那场惨状，而现在市场已经有了一些复苏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum was very close to going below 3,000 during that time. Bitcoin did go below 100,000. And Ethereum right now at 3350, which I know is not near anywhere where it was over the past month, but at least it's not below 3,000. Then Bitcoin right here making a rebound above 102.8, which is also not as bad either, given it was at like 99 last night. So, if you just slept early last night and didn't look at your portfolio, you didn't see some of the carnage that was happening and now you've had a little bit of more of a recovery.</p>
</details>

### 选举结果对市场情绪的影响

我认为，因不确定选举结果而产生的一些不稳定或波动性已经得到解决。因此，市场中出现了更多的……不能说是兴奋，而是一种普遍的“嘿，我们不必那么害怕了”的情绪。我对此的初步理论是，昨晚民主党在几乎每个州都大获全胜，包括我的家乡新泽西州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless, I think some of the instability or volatility of not knowing what would happen in the elections was resolved. And as a result of that, you got a lot more uh not excitement in the markets, but just general like, hey, we don't have to be that afraid. And sort of my working theory around this is that Democrats sweeped last night across pretty much every state uh including my home state, New Jersey.</p>
</details>

我认为这向共和党人表明，他们将不得不重新开放政府并与民主党人谈判。因为到了这个地步，如果政府停摆继续，而民主党昨晚在全国范围内大获全胜，你就不想冒着在中期选举中失去众议院和参议院的风险。政府关门的时间越长，民主党就越有机会将责任归咎于共和党人，尽管共和党人也在将责任推给民主党人，但这只会增加在中期选举中失利的潜在波动性。结果对执政党来说将是不利的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I think what that showed the Republicans is they're going to have to reopen to the government and negotiate with the Democrats because at this point, if the shutdown continues to happen and the Democrats had a clean sweep last night across the entire country, you don't want to risk the midterms and losing the House and the Senate. And the longer the government is shut down and the more opportunity Democrats have to pin this on the Republicans, even though Republicans are pling it on pinning it on the Democrats, it just creates more volatility on potentially losing the midterms. And as a result, that would not be good for the party in power.</p>
</details>

所以，也许市场正在消化这样的预期：嘿，这是给所有人的一个警醒，政府必须重新开放。而政府的重新开放可能成为推动市场不再像以前那样恐慌的顺风。我认为这大概就是目前的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so maybe the market's kind of pricing in, hey, this is a kick in the ass to everybody to say the government's got to reopen and the government reopening could be the tailwind to get the market to not be, you know, as scared as it was before. So I think that's kind of what's going on right here, but we'll talk more about it.</p>
</details>

### 盘前动态与财报焦点

我们有昨天发布的AMD和SMCI的财报，稍后会讨论。今天早上Lemonade的业绩绝对是碾压性的，我们也会谈到。Lemonade股价上涨14%是理所当然的，他们的财报确实非常出色。我们还有其他一些公司的财报，比如麦当劳等。标普500指数微涨。SoFi昨晚一度跌破29美元，现在回升至29.81美元以上。Grab股价为5.81美元。英伟达上涨0.5%，昨晚曾跌至190美元左右。Palantir曾跌至181美元左右。你可以看到很多股票都在反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got AMD earnings from yesterday. SMCI earnings, we'll talk about that. Lemonade absolutely crushed it this morning. We'll get into that. Lemonade right there deserves to be up 14%. I mean, absolutely incredible. It was absolutely an incredible incredible earnings from Lemonade and so wasn't too bad to kind of see those results. We had a bunch of other earnings. McDonald's etc. S&P slightly green 67585. SoFi right there up. SoFi was like below 29 last night. Now it's above 29.81. Grab right there at 581. Nvidia up half a percent. Nvidia got down to like 190. Palantir got down to like 181. I mean you're just seeing a bunch of different rebounds.</p>
</details>

Robin Hood今天发布财报。我会在3:30和Roy、Tanner一起直播。这将会是今天的一个重头戏。周一Palantir的财报非常出色，今天轮到Robin Hood了。除了Robin Hood，还有很多其他公司，我们都会在财报直播中进行报道。然后，特斯拉的股东投票将在明天举行。特斯拉股价目前在451美元，上涨了1.5%，表现不错。所以盘前市场是绿色的。这种绿色能否持续？谁知道呢。但至少在昨天之后我们看到了一些绿色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood earnings are today. I'll be live at 3:30 with Roy and Tanner. This is going to be a big one today. Uh we had Palantir on Monday. They crushed it. Robin Hood is going to be today. So this is going to be a very big one. We got a lot of other companies besides Robin Hood as well. So we'll be covering that all on earnings. And then Tesla, the shareholder vote is tomorrow. Tesla right there at 451. Very nice to see. That's up 1.5%. So you have a green pre-market. Will this green pre-market continue. Who knows? But at least we do have some green after yesterday.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，昨天，如果你没有关注市场，你可能没注意到，但加密货币市场有2500亿美元被清算。2500亿美元在加密货币市场被清算，这显然给各行各业带来了巨大的痛苦。我仍然不知道为什么会有那么大规模的加密货币清算。不知道是因为杠杆，还是人们恐慌性抛售。但如果你看看这个屏幕，所有东西都受到了冲击。所以，今天能有一定程度的恢复，已经令人鼓舞了。但昨天确实有点像一场血洗。看起来我们正在迎来一些复苏，我们将在今天余下的时间里报道其余的财报，看看这种势头能否持续到本周末。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yesterday, by the way. I mean, again, if you just didn't pay attention to the markets yesterday, you probably didn't notice, but $250 billion dollars in the crypto markets were liquidated. And the fact that $250 billion dollars were liquidated in the crypto markets, obviously that caused a lot of pain across a variety of industries. I still don't know why there was that much crypto liquidation. I don't know if it's leverage, if it's people that were just panic selling, but if you take a look at this this screen right here, everything everything got hit. So, the fact that we're even getting somewhat of a recovery today is uh encouraging to see. But yeah, yesterday was a bit of a blood bath. It seems like we're getting a little recovery and we're going to cover the rest of the earnings throughout the day and see if this can continue as we get into the end of this week.</p>
</details>

### 纽约市长选举深度解析

好了，我们开始吧。再次感谢大家来到这里。我想我们先快速谈谈选举结果，然后再继续。民主党取得了全面胜利。Mandani成为纽约市的新市长。他将在明年一月宣誓就职。看到这一切真是相当不可思议。我昨晚看了他的胜选演说。我必须说，胜选演说的基调非常自负。客观地说，那不是一种谦逊的、号召“让我们团结城市”的演说，而是“我们赢了，这是一个新城市，一种新的政治思维范式”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started. Again, thank you everybody for being here. I think we'll just get started real quick on the election results and then we'll keep going from there. Uh again, Democrats had a clean sweep. Mandani is the new mayor of New York City. In January, he will be sworn in as the uh mayor. It was quite incredible to see. I did watch his victory speech last night. I will definitely say the tone of the victory speech was uh very braggadocious. I think objectively it was not one of those humble hey you know let's bring the city together. It was mother effer we won this is a new city this is a new uh paradigm of thinking of politics.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，演说中带有一个非常强烈的阶级斗争信息。他引用了过去著名的社会主义者作为论据，这让我觉得相当不可思议。从我看到的许多视频和片段来看，Mandani更像是一个和蔼可亲、试图与你交朋友的人。但这次的演说，在某些时刻听起来几乎就像是“我们要推翻资本家阶级”。我没想到他的演说会如此激进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and quite frankly there was a very strong classfocused message in the speech. I mean, he was quoting famous socialists of the past as as as references for trying to make the argument that he was making, which I I thought was quite incredible. I mean, I I you know, Mandani from what I've seen in a lot of different videos and clips is more so this like guy who's like nice and just trying to be your friend. This one was like quite literally this one was like we are going to take over the capitalist class and and to an extent it almost literally sounded like that in certain moments. So, I I thought that was quite incredible. I didn't expect the speech to be as aggressive as he went for.</p>
</details>

演说的核心是，这是属于工薪阶层的时代。工薪阶层决定朝着一个明确为他们服务的方向前进。现在需要几年的时间来看看是否能取得任何与Mandani过去几个月所宣称的雄心相匹配的实际进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but the speech was, hey, this is the time for working-class people. Working class people decided to make a decision to go in a direction that is explicitly for them. And now it's going to uh take a few years to see if there's any level of progress that matches the reality or matches the ambition of what Mumdani has been saying over the past couple of months.</p>
</details>

从人口统计数据来看，按性别和年龄划分，18至29岁的男性中有68%投票给了Mandani，而18至29岁的女性中则有84%投票给了他。所以我们谈论的是千禧一代的男性和女性。未来几天，我们将获得更多关于种族、性别和人口统计的队列数据，以了解投票的最终情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are the demographics. So if you look at it by gender uh and age, you had men 18 to 29, 68% of them went for Mumani and then women 18 to 29, 84% of them went for Mumani. So you're talking about millennial men and women and we're going to get a lot more cohorts of of race and gender and demographics over the coming days in terms of how the vote ended out.</p>
</details>

如果你关注报道，投票结果在五分钟内就揭晓了。首先，纽约的选举投票率历来很低。我想这次有两百万人投票，这至少是过去几十年来市长选举的记录。两分钟之内，当他们拿到大部分选区的票数时，布朗克斯是最后一个。布朗克斯是该市民主党色彩最浓的选区。这已经是Mandani的囊中之物了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But dude, the vote was called if you were if you were um looking at the coverage, the vote was called within like five minutes because New York, first of all, there New York is known for historically low election uh voting turnout. So I think two million people voted, which was like a record at least over the past couple decades for these mayoral elections. And within two minutes, as soon as they got most of the burrows, the Bronx was the last burrow. Bronx is the most heavily democratic burrow in the city. It it was Mani's race. It was it.</p>
</details>

我不会说这是压倒性的授权，因为Cuomo获得了42%的选票，Mandani大约51%，而Silva大约7%。所以即使Silva退出，所有选票都流向Cuomo，Cuomo仍然会输，但Mandani的领先优势会缩小到3%或4%，竞争会激烈得多。所以，我不会说这是一个全面的授权，不像特朗普在2024年赢得几乎所有摇摆州那样。但无论如何，这是纽约在治理方式上采取了一种全新的思维方式。Mandani现在是纽约市长了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, I wouldn't say it was a mandate because Cuomo got 42% of it. Mdani had like 51 and then Silva had like seven. So, even if Silva had left and that all that went to Cuomo, Cuomo still would have lost, but it would have been like a 3 or 4% margin by which Mdani would have win. It would have been a lot closer. And so, I wouldn't say it's a full-on mandate uh like Trump had, you know, by winning almost every single swing state in well, literally every single swing state in 2024. But nonetheless, it was New York making an entirely new way of thinking in regards to how they're going to uh govern themselves. And Mandani is now the mayor of New York. So there you go.</p>
</details>

这对市场意味着什么？坦率地说，昨晚它为市场带来了很多确定性。在选举结果公布之前，市场正在下跌。我认为市场只是想要一些确定性。昨晚我们相对迅速地得到了确定性，你看到了市场的反弹。或者，这可能对市场毫无意义，只是算法交易在选举期间来回波动，这只是选举带来的一些波动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does this mean for the markets? Quite frankly, it added a lot of clarity to the markets last night and and realistically before the uh before the markets or before the elections were called, the markets were dumping. I think the markets just wanted some clarity. I really do. and the fact that we got clarity last night relatively quickly you saw the markets rebounding or it could mean nothing for the markets and it was just convenient that Algo started going back and forth during the election and that was some of the election volatility.</p>
</details>

但归根结底，我不知道这对选举有多大意义。纽约市长必须与奥尔巴尼的州长合作才能完成任何事情。如果他想真正实现免费公交、免费医疗或儿童保育，或者对富人增税，他真的需要与纽约州合作，而不仅仅是纽约市议会，因为他们的权力不大。所以，现在需要几年的时间来看看Mandani能否实现他的整体政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh I don't know if it says much about the election at the end of the day the mayor of New York has to govern with the uh or has to work with the governor of Albany to be able to get anything done if he wants to actually get free buses or free healthcare or child care or raise taxes on the rich like you're really going to need to work with New York State not just the New York City state assembly because they don't have that much power and So, it's now going to be a couple years to see if Mumdani can carry out this overall policy.</p>
</details>

一直非常反对Mandani的Bill Ackman昨天发了一条非常简单的推文，140个字符：“Mandani，恭喜获胜。现在你责任重大。如果我能在纽约市提供帮助，请告诉我我能做什么。”所以，尽管他曾强烈反对这个人获胜，但他现在准备好帮助纽约市。Bill Ackman是土生土长的纽约人，他显然热爱这座城市，想留在这里，很可能不会搬到迈阿密。但这就是Ackman在这次选举后采取的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Bill Aman, who's been very against Mumani, he tweeted yesterday, 140 characters, very simple. Mumdani, congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help in NYC, just let me know what I can do. So, uh, although he was vehemently against this guy winning, uh, he's ready to help New York City. And, you know, Bill Aman's a native New Yorker. He obviously loves the city. He wants to be in the city. is likely not leaving to Miami. Um, but that is the approach that Aman is taking now based on this election. So, there you go.</p>
</details>

这就是昨晚发生的事情，市场似乎已经翻篇了。现在我们将进入2026年的中期选举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what we got. That's what happened last night and markets seem to be moving on from it. And now we will move on to midterms going into 2026.</p>

### ADP就业数据解读

好的，**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: 一家提供人力资源管理软件和服务的美国公司，其发布的私营部门就业报告是市场关注的重要经济指标）私营部门就业报告。我们今天早上得到了这个数据。我忘了我们会得到这个数字，但我们得到了。新增就业42,000人，预期为22,000人。还算不错。此前9月份的数据是减少29,000人。所以劳动力市场出现了一定程度的向好稳定。市场认为私营部门会增加22,000个工作岗位，而10月份的ADP数据显示我们增加了42,000个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, private ADP payrolls. We got that this morning. I forgot we were getting this number, but we got it. 42,000 versus 22,000 expected. Not too bad. It follows a 29,000 decline uh in September. So you have some level of stability to the upside in the labor market. The market thought we would add 22,000 jobs on the private payroll uh sector. October ADP showed we added 42,000.</p>
</details>

尽管我们没有政府发布的劳动力市场数据，也没有像JOLTS或失业救济申请这样的各种工具，但我们确实有一些第三方数据，这些数据表明报告可能没有那么糟糕。让我们来看一下关于这方面的一些报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, we had a 29,000 decline in September. So although we don't have labor market data from the government, we don't have a variety of different tools like jolts or jobless claims from the government. We do have some of this third party data which is signaling that maybe the reports are not as bad. Let's get a little bit of coverage on this and then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

ADP私营部门就业数据刚刚出炉。ADP表示，10月份私营部门就业人数增加了42,000人。按行业划分，分布还算均衡：商品生产部门增加9,000人，服务提供部门增加33,000人。问题是，这是否是我们必须适应的新常态？一个相对平淡的数字，因为我们没有劳动力增长。相对于劳动力增长，这是一个好数字吗？我们不知道，因为我们没有失业规模，没有家庭调查数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The ADP private payroll data, it's just out. Steve Leeman joins us with those numbers. >> Numbers. What a what a what a thought. Fantastic. ADP saying that private payrolls grew by 42,000 in the month of October. Uh with a decent split when it comes to by sector goods producing up 9,000, service providing up 33,000. This is a question. Is this the new normal we have to get used to? Is a relatively lackluster number that because we have we don't have the labor force growth. Is this a good number relative to the labor force growth? We don't know because we don't have the unemployment size. What I don't the the the the household survey.</p>
</details>

我不喜欢的是我们是如何达到这个数字的。这有点令人担忧。小企业，即员工少于50人的企业，减少了10,000个工作岗位。这已经是他们连续第三个月裁员了。中型企业减少了21,000人，而大型企业，即员工超过500人的企业，才是就业增长的来源。我有一个担忧，从个别案例来看，这可能是关税效应的潜在影响，小企业受到了伤害，也许在消费层面也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I don't like is how we got here. And this is something that's a a bit of concern here. Small businesses uh less than 50 workers losing 10,000. That is the third month in a row that they have lost workers here. Mediumsize down 21,000 and large over 500. That's where the job gains are. I have a concern anecdotally that this is a potential tariff effect here where small business is being hurt also perhaps at the consumer level. What's going on?</p>
</details>

这就是就业报告。现在，有些人会说这是好消息还是坏消息。你会说好消息是坏消息的原因是，我们需要降息是因为劳动力市场正在走弱。所以如果劳动力市场在走强，这难道不会阻碍降息吗？我并不这么认为。这是一份不错的报告，但不是一份惊人的报告。我的意思是，它不是那种“天哪，我们增加了50万个工作岗位”的报告。我们增加了44,000个，而且正如你刚才看到的细分数据，员工少于50人的小企业实际上在裁员，唯一增加就业的是员工超过500人的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so that's the jobs report. Now again, uh some people are saying is this good news is bad news and the reason you would say it's good news is bad news is because um the reason we need a rate cut is because the labor market is weakening. So if the labor market is strengthening, wouldn't this oppose the ability to get a rate cut? And I don't really think that's the case. This was a good report. This was not a phenomenal report. So what I mean by that is this was not like oh my god we added 500,000 jobs. This is we added 44,000 and as you saw the breakdown right there small businesses less than 50 employees actually lost jobs and the only businesses that added jobs were businesses above 500 employees.</p>
</details>

归根结底，小企业是国家的支柱。所以如果小企业处境艰难，很可能因为利率太高而无法承担资本成本，他们就无法继续雇佣员工。如果这种效应在全国范围内持续累积，显然你会看到劳动力市场更加疲软。所以，这是一份不错的报告，因为如果我们得到一个负的就业数字，那将表明我们真的需要降息。我们仍然非常需要降息，只是情况没有像出现负50万个工作岗位那样危急。因为如果是那样，就意味着我们的经济存在根本性问题，降息可能都无法解决，因为降息需要一年时间才能产生任何有意义的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and small businesses at the end of the day at the backbone of the country. So if you do have small businesses that are hurting and likely cannot afford the cost of capital because rates are too high. They can't continue to employ people. If that effect continues to compound across the entire country I mean obviously you're going to get a lot more labor market weakness. So th this was a good report in the fact that if we had a negative jobs number it would signal that we really need a rate cut. We still really need a rate cut. It's just not as dire of a situation as if we had like negative 500,000 jobs because if that's the case then we have an underlying problem in the economy and rate cuts probably are not even going to solve that because you need a year for rate cuts to even have any level of meaningful impact.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是一份不错的报告。不是最好的，也不是最坏的，但我认为这份报告足以强化我们将在12月继续看到降息的论点。尽管鲍威尔和美联储希望表现出尽可能多的谨慎，但我们很可能会在12月迎来降息，而且继续降息很重要。

<p class="english-text">So I think it was a good report. It was not the best report, not the worst report, but it was enough of a report, I think, to reinforce this argument that we are going to continue to see a December rate cut. Even though JPO and the Fed want to signal as much caution as they can, we're likely getting that December cut and it is important that we continue to get that cut.</p>

### 关键公司财报回顾

好了，财报。我们今天有很多财报。首先，让我们快速看一下AMD。在我看来，AMD的业绩非常出色。我认为AMD的财报没什么问题。我们和Jose Neil一起做了直播报道。股价在244美元，下跌了约2%。收入增长了36%。**EPS**（Earnings Per Share：每股收益，是衡量公司盈利能力的重要指标）超出了预期。业绩指引比预期的要强一些。在财报电话会议上，他们被问及能提供哪些关于指引的具体细节，但他们未能真正给出这些细节，因为他们下周将有一个投资者活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, earnings. Let's get into it. So, we had a lot of earnings today. First of all, uh let's just real quick do AMD. AMD crushed it in my opinion. I don't think AMD had a bad earnings. We covered it live with Jose Neil. 244. It's down about 2%. Revenue was up 36%. They beat on EPS. The guide was a bit stronger than expected. They did get questioned on the earnings call on what exactly they can give on terms of details on the guide and they weren't able to really give those details because they're going to have some investor event uh next week.</p>
</details>

所以他们把很多信息留到了下周。但总的来说，EPS超出预期3%，收入超出预期6%。收入同比增长36%，EPS增长30%。我认为这是一个相当不错的季度，季度本身没有任何值得担忧的地方。它不像拉里·埃里森的甲骨文那样，**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligation：剩余履约义务，指已签订合同但尚未确认为收入的金额）增长率高达300-400%。所以他们有点像在计入甲骨文和OpenAI的指引，但没有真正展示出很多这些数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, they're saving a lot of that information for next week. But overall, 3% beat on EPS, 6% beat on revenue. Revenue is up 36% year-over-year. EPS up 30%. I thought it was a pretty good quarter and I don't think there was anything to be concerned about in the quarter itself. It wasn't some massive uh Larry Ellison Oracle type of RPO growth that was up like 3 400%.</p>
</details>

因为如果他们真的展示出来，他们给出的收入指引至少会是354%，但他们给出的指引是大约25%，这是合理的。这远好于他们上个季度14%的数据中心收入。所以，现在股价相对平稳。再次强调，在宣布与OpenAI合作后，股价从150美元涨到了250美元。所以它现在没有太大变动了。Palantir也是一样，对吧？经历了一次大涨后，与几周前相比，股价相对平稳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they're kind of baking in the Oracle the open eye guidance but not legitimately showing uh a lot of those numbers because if they were to legitimately show you know they'd be guiding for revenues of minimum of like 354% but they're guiding for about 25% which is reasonable. It's way better than the 14% data center revenues that they had uh last quarter. And so, you know, the stock is relatively flat now. Again, the stock moved from 150 to 250 after that opening ideal. So, it's not moving that much anymore. Same thing with Palanteer, right? Made a big move. It's relatively flat compared to where it was a couple weeks ago.</p>
</details>

所以我不认为任何持有AMD的人应该感到不安，因为你们的大动作，你们真正的“超级碗”时刻，发生在一个月前，当他们宣布与OpenAI合作时。一旦宣布了合作，那才是真正的股价驱动因素。如果股价继续上涨，那当然很好。但如果下跌，考虑到它在一个月内基于与OpenAI的合作关系增加了1000亿美元的市值，而他们甚至还没有从OpenAI获得任何收入，你也不能太不知足。华尔街愿意给予它这样的估值，本身就已经相当不错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't think anyone who's in AMD should be that upset because your big move, your real Super Bowl happened a month ago when they announced the opening eye partnership. Once that was announced, that really was the move. And if it goes higher, that's great. But if it goes lower, I you can't be that ungrateful given it added, you know, 100 billion of market cap in a month based on that OpenAI partnership and they don't even have any revenue from OpenAI. So the fact that the streets are willing to give it a multiple itself, I think is pretty decent.</p>
</details>

CrowdStrike和CoreWeave宣布建立全球合作伙伴关系，为“代理时代”（Agentic Era）提供安全的AI云基础，并加速实现安全的通用人工智能（AGI）。这个标题里的时髦词汇真是太多了。代理时代，安全的AGI。天哪。好吧，让我们看看CrowdStrike的股价是否上涨。没有，CrowdStrike股价平平。CoreWeave涨了一点。昨天，CoreWeave和Nebius以及其他数据中心概念股一起下跌了。其中很多在盘前市场正在恢复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Crowd Strike and Core announced a global partnership to power the Secure AI cloud foundation for the Agentic Era and accelerate towards secure AGI. The amount of buzzwords in that headline, goodness gracious. A gentic era secure AGI. Oh boy. Well, let's see if Crowd Strike is pumping. Nope. Crowd Strike's flat. Coreweave. Coreweave's up a little bit. Coran Nebius got hit yesterday along with the other data center plays. A lot of those are recovering in the pre-market.</p>
</details>

今天早上我们有哪些财报？如果有人持有这些股票，请告诉我。我们先从Lemonade开始。Lemonade的业绩非常出色。他们的EPS比预期高出27%，同比增长46%。收入同比增长42%，超出预期5%。恭喜那些持有Lemonade的投资者。这绝对是令人难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So that's what we had for AMD earnings this morning. What do we have? Let me know if anyone owns any of these names. So, let's start off with uh some of these companies. Lemonade crushed it. They beat by 27% on EPS. EPS is up 46% year-over-year. Revenue is up 42% year-over-year as they beat revenue by 5%. Congratulations to those who have uh Lemonade. Absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

如果你看这张图表，保费增长了30%，客户数量增长了24%，而他们的总亏损率下降了11%。他们做到这一切的同时，自2022年以来，包括增长在内的运营费用仅增长了10%。所以Lemonade绝对配得上他们在盘前市场获得的上涨势头，股价上涨了70%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look at this chart right here, premiums are up 30%, customers are up 24%, and their gross loss ratio is down 11%. They did all of this while operating expenses included growth of just 10% since 2022. So Lemonade absolutely deserves the uh momentum that they're getting right here in the pre-market up 70%.</p>
</details>

另外，这只是一家市值50亿美元的公司。我知道他们还没有盈利。看起来他们正走在盈利的道路上。他们距离正式盈利大约还差51美分。但随着他们继续扩大业务模式，似乎值得在50亿美元市值时更深入地研究一下。我知道AI是他们的首席执行官一直在谈论的一个顺风，与他们如何为保险进行承保相结合。看起来他们在这些财报中执行得很好，业绩相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, this is only a $5 billion company. So I know they're not profitable yet. It looks like they are on path to getting to profitability. They're about 51 cents away from officially becoming profitable. But it does seem like as they continue to scale that business model and maybe it's worth looking into a lot more at, you know, a $5 billion market cap. I know AI, we did a deep dive on this a long time ago. AI is kind of a tailwind that their CEO is talking about mixed at the intersection of how they underwrite for insurance. It looks like they executed in those earnings were not too bad at all.</p>
</details>

麦当劳的业绩未达预期，EPS为3.22美元，低于预期的3.33美元，营收为70亿美元，低于预期的70.9亿美元。营收同比增长3%，EPS同比下降。麦当劳的股价实际上是上涨的。我没有听到他们在电话会议或业绩指引中说的所有内容，但我认为他们确实说了一件事，那就是同店销售额同比增长了约3%。所以情况并没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">McDonald's, they missed by 3%. 322 versus 333 expected on EPS and then 7.0 over 7.09 on revenue. Revenue is up 3% year-over-year. EPS is down year overyear. McDonald's stock is actually up. So, I don't I didn't hear everything they said in the call or in guidance, but I think I think the one thing they did say was same store sales are up year-over-year by like 3%. So, it's not like that bad.</p>
</details>

即使顶线数据不是最好的，但麦当劳并没有像Chipotle和Cava昨晚那样，发出关于低收入人群无力负担食物的破坏性信号。理论上，因为麦当劳应该足够便宜，肯定比Cava或Chipotle便宜。但该股在盘前市场微涨1.75%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh even if the topline numbers are not the best, but McDonald's not really signaling the type of destruction that Chipotle signaled. And to an extent, Cabba signaled last night about the demographic that is more lowincome not being able to afford food. theoretically because McDonald's should be cheap enough definitely cheaper than Cabo or Chipotle but that stock right there 1.75% slightly green in the pre-market</p>
</details>

Ripple宣布获得由Fortress和Citadel Securities领投的5亿美元投资。哇，这是否会影响XRP的价格？XRP涨了一点，没什么太大的动静，但还是涨了。自从稳定币变得更加主流以来，我们已经很久没有听到关于Ripple的消息了，因为我感觉Ripple的整个用例，或者至少我从Steve那里理解的是跨境支付。我觉得现在很多其他区块链上的稳定币也在做同样的事情，不仅仅是Ripple。所以，我想我们得随着时间的推移看看结果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ripple announces $500 million investment led by Fortress Citadel Securities. Oh wow, Steve's going to love that. Okay, is that move in XRP price? XRP. It's up a little bit. Nothing too crazy, but it's up a little bit. There you go. Ripple getting a $500 million investment. You know, we haven't heard that much about Ripple ever since like stable coins became more mainstream because I feel like the entire use case of Ripple or at least the way I understand it from Steve was crossber payments. And I feel like that's kind of happening with stable coins on a lot of other blockchains, not just Ripple. So, I guess we're going to see over time if that ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

Unity的业绩也非常好。他们超出了预期18%，EPS为20美分，预期为17美分，营收为4.7亿美元，预期为4.53亿美元。他们超出预期4%。营收同比增长5%，EPS同比增长5%。又一个在顶线和底线都持续超出预期的公司。我们没有确切的统计数据，有多少公司在顶线和底线都超出了预期，但数量相当可观。我敢说至少有50%，可能接近75%到80%的公司都做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unity, they crushed it as well. 18% they beat 20 cents versus 17 cents expected and then 4.70 versus 453 million expected. They beat by 4%. Revenues up 5% year-over-year. EPS is up 5% year-over-year. Again, another name that just continues to beat on the top and the bottom. We don't have the exact aggregated stats of how many companies have beat top and bottom, but it's a decent amount. I would I would argue it's minimum 50%, probably closer to 75 to 80% of companies that have be on the top and the bottom.</p>
</details>

Unity在盘前市场上涨了18%。哇，Unity和Lemonade。这就是牛市健康的一面。如果你能实现双重超预期，并给出真正好的财报，你就会得到奖励。如果你做不到，你就会被重创。这些公司正在展示他们可以做到，即使他们不是世界上最大的公司，这一点非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unity, right? They're up 18% in the pre-markets. Wow. Unity and lemonade. And you know, this is the healthy part of a bull market. If you can double beat and really give some good earnings, you're going to get rewarded. If you can't, you're going to get crushed. And these companies are showing that they can, even if they're not the biggest companies in the world, which is very important.</p>
</details>

SolarEdge也超出了预期。每股亏损31美分，预期为42美分；营收3.4亿美元，预期为3.36亿美元。他们营收超出预期1%，EPS超出预期26%。营收同比增长44%，EPS同比增长98%。我们知道Enphase几周前因财报而股价下跌。SolarEdge下跌了6%。即使顶线和底线都取得了相当不错的超预期业绩，过去两年太阳能股的表现实在不尽如人意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Solar Edge, uh, they beat as well. Negative 31 cents versus 42 cents, 340 versus 336. They beat by 1%, 26% beat on EPS. Revenues up 44% year-over-year. EPS is up 98%. Now, we know that Nphase got hit a couple weeks ago on their earnings. Solar Edge is down 6%. Even with a pretty good beat on the top and the bottom, the solar stocks realistically for the past two years have just not been where you want it to be.</p>
</details>

昨天我们还有SMCI的财报。我不知道为什么SMCI跌得那么惨，但他们确实未达预期。但就像他们两周前给出的初步结果一样，已经告诉你他们会未达预期，而分析师们仍然对他们未达预期感到失望，所以股价下跌了。SMCI是一只非常波动的股票，在公布数据后下跌了约8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we did have SMCI yesterday. I don't know why SMCI got as crushed as it did, but uh they missed. But it's kind of like the preliminary results they gave two weeks ago were telling you they were going to miss and analysts were still upset that they missed and so stock went down. So SMCI right here a very volatile stock 4360 that's down about 8% after those numbers.</p>
</details>

Zeta的顶线和底线也都超出了预期。Zeta上涨了11%。这也是一份相当不错的财报。有很多市值低于200亿美元的小公司，它们交出的业绩不仅证明了其增长估值的合理性，也为继续获得增长估值提供了必要条件。Zeta的EPS超出预期11%，为20美分，预期为18美分；营收超出预期3%，为3.37亿美元，预期为3.27亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Zeta they also beat on the top of the bottom line. Zeta up 11%. Uh this was a pretty good earnings as well. I mean you had a lot of these smaller companies under 20 billion that are putting up results that are necessary to justify not only their growth multiple but to continue getting a growth multiple. Zeta right there beat by 11% on EPS. 20 cents versus 18 cents expected and then 3% 337 versus 327. And so Zeta continued to crush as well.</p>
</details>

昨天真正遭受重创的一只股票是Axon。我认为这只是因为估值溢价太高了，股价下跌了21%。这家公司主要向警察销售执法记录仪。他们的EPS未达预期约20%。而且，他们的股票交易估值相当高。在这种情况下，你不能在EPS上失手。我认为这次下跌最终会被买入。它不是散户的最爱，日交易量不到一百万股，但机构很喜欢这只股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one stock that got really wrecked yesterday was Axon. And I think this is just because the valuation had too much of a premium focus down 21% right here. These guys sell body cameras primarily at police officers. They missed on EPS by about 20%. And you know, their stock was just trading at a at a pretty aggressive multiple. You can't miss on EPS when it comes to this type of stuff. I think this dip ends up getting bought. It's not really a retail favorite. Less than a million shares traded per day, but institutions love the name.</p>
</details>

### 市场情绪与未来展望

昨天人们之所以如此困惑，甚至不是担心，而是恼火，是因为没有人知道原因。没有人真正知道我们为什么跌得那么惨。也许是Michael Burry的事情，但没有人真正理解为什么情况那么糟糕。你可以把它归咎于算法交易或其他什么，但我认为缺乏一个实际的解释是让人们感到恼火的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the reason people were so confused yesterday, not even worried, but just annoyed, is because no one had a reason. No one had a real reason why we were as red as we were, right? Maybe it was the Michael Bur thing. It's like but no one really understood why things were as bad as they were and uh you could chalk it up to alos or whatever but I think the lack of a actual explanation is what was kind of annoying people.</p>
</details>

我们现在正在恢复，所以情况不像昨晚那么严重了。但我确实认为，正是那部分让人们思考，到底发生了什么，为什么情况这么糟糕。标普500指数目前在675.55点，有所回升。AMD下跌1.8%。谷歌也在努力回到280美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know we're kind of recovering here so it's not like it's as aggressive as it was last night but I do think that was the part that made people think okay what the heck is going on and why are things as bad as they are but S&P 500 right here at 675.55 a little bit of recovery. AMD right here down 1.8%. Google as well trying to get back up to 280.</p>
</details>

有人说我们又被高估了。我认为股市的某些部分被高估了，但如果你告诉我Meta在20倍市盈率时被高估了……他们昨晚在隔夜市场几乎把Meta的股价打到600美元以下，当时是610美元左右。我不知道，伙计。它已经经历了一次相当大的回调。我不知道它是否需要跌到550美元，市场才会觉得：“是的，对于一家年收入2000亿美元的公司来说，这太便宜了，不容忽视。”但无论如何，我想我们最终还是要看市场如何解读当前的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's because we're overvalued again. Like I think certain pockets of the stock market are overvalued, but if you're going to tell me that Meta at 20 times earnings was overvalued, they they do they almost took Meta below 600 last night in the overnight markets. It was at like 610. I don't know, dude. Like it's it already had a pretty big draw down. I don't know if it needs to go to like 550 for the market to be like, "Yeah, this is too cheap to ignore a company doing 200 billion revenue, but regardless, I guess we're going to have to ultimately see how the market interprets what we got going on."</p>

### 政治动态：特朗普言论与关税争议

我们有一些特朗普的言论。他正在一个共和党早餐会上讲话。第一，特朗普说股市将创下更多历史新高。股市在过去几个月里已经多次创下历史新高。政府停摆正在影响股市。我们还看到普京对特朗普做出了回应。普京就特朗普关于核试验的声明表示，这是一个严肃的问题，将取决于美国的行动。俄罗斯国防部长称美国正在加强战略武器。如果美国放弃核试验暂停令，也可能破坏全球战略安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got some quotes by Trump. He is speaking right now at a Republican uh breakfast number one. Trump says the stock market will hit more record highs. Stock market has hit many record highs in the last months. the shutdown is impacting the stock market. Uh he also we also had Putin respond to Trump. Putin on Trump's statement about nuclear tests. It's a serious issue will be directed by the actions of the United States. Russian defense minister says US is building up strategic weapons. US could also destroy global strategic safety if they abandon nuclear test moratorium.</p>
</details>

特朗普周日在《60分钟》节目中确实表示，他们将重启核试验，因为他们知道俄罗斯和中国正在重启这些试验，因此他们也想继续测试他们的核武器。所以今天早上普京对此做出了回应，而特朗普则在谈论股市将继续创下历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump did say on 60 Minutes on Sunday that they are going to restart their nuclear tests because they know that Russia and China are restarting those tests and as a result they want to um they want to continue testing their nuclear weapons as well. So you have Putin responding to that this morning and then you have Trump talking about the stock market continuing to be at record highs.</p>
</details>

好的，我们来谈谈关税，因为今天最高法院将正式开始审理对特朗普政府关税政策的挑战。特朗普曾表示，如果最高法院不维持关税，这将是这个国家历史上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's talk about tariffs because today is officially the day that the Supreme Court is going to start hearing the challenges to the Trump administration's tariff policy. Trump has said this would be the worst thing for the history of this country if uh we did not have the tariffs continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
</details>

特朗普政府要求最高法院——记住，特朗普任命了九名大法官中的三名——推翻下级法院的一项裁决。该裁决认为，大部分关税是非法使用《国际经济紧急权力法》。特朗普利用该法案实施了他所谓的“芬太尼关税”和“解放日关税”。估计有900亿美元的关税收入悬而未决。财政部表示，如果特朗普政府输掉这场官司，今年很可能不得不退还这笔钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court where remember Trump has appointed three of nine members to reverse a ruling from a lower court that found that most of the tariffs are an illegal use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump has used that law to impose what he called his fentanyl tariffs, his liberation day tariffs earlier this year. An estimated $90 billion in tariff revenue hangs on the high court's ruling here. Treasury has said it most likely would have to send that money back this year if the Trump administration is to lose this case.</p>
</details>

现在，请记住，宪法将征收关税和税收的权力赋予了国会。在特朗普之前，没有哪位总统使用过这项1977年的法律来实施关税。但该法案确实允许总统“监管由外国或外国国民拥有的财产的进口”。白宫表示，这足以允许这些关税。但起诉政府的企业辩称，监管权与征税权不同，因此关税应被推翻。我们将看看法院对此有何看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now remember, the Constitution gives the power to impose tariffs and taxes to Congress. No president before Trump has used this 1977 law to put tariffs in place. But the law does allow a president to quote regulate imports of property owned by a foreign country or foreign national. Now, the White House says that's enough to allow these tariffs. But the businesses that are suing the administration argue that the power to regulate is not the same as the power to tax and therefore the tariffs should be struck down. We'll see what the court has to say about all this at about 10:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
</details>

这件事的微妙之处在于，裁决将在明年一月做出。今天将进行听证，但他们未来几个月内不会做出决定。如果他们做出不利于特朗普关税的裁决——我真的不认为会发生，考虑到最高法院的构成——特朗普政府已经表示，他们有80%到90%的关税可以通过一些后门漏洞来实施。所以即使他们得到一个不利的关税裁决，特朗普会不高兴，但他仍然认为有办法在不通过行政命令的情况下实施关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the the the nuance to this is that this will be decided in January. It's going to be heard today, but uh they're not going to make a decision for the next couple months. And if they were to go against Trump's tariffs, which I I really don't think is going to happen just given the the making of the Supreme Court, um the Trump administration has said they have 80 to 90% of their tariffs are going to be covered in like some backdoor loopholes for them to be able to navigate uh how they're going to be able to implement the tariffs. So even if they were to get a tariff ruling that was unfavorable to them, Trump would be upset. But he still thinks there's a way for them to implement the tariffs without going through the executive orders.</p>
</details>

尽管如此，我确实认为这是市场希望得到明确的一件事。因为如果市场在这方面得不到明确，他们就会想，嘿，等等，这里发生了什么？我们什么时候才能知道我们与这些国家达成的、完全取决于关税的协议是否会继续有效？我不认为市场已经消化了这种波动性，因为它不是什么大事。而且我认为市场的大部分看法是，最高法院很可能不会推翻它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nonetheless, I do think it's going to be one thing that the markets are going to want some clarity on because if the markets don't get clarity on that, you know, they're going to be wondering, hey, wait a second. What's going on here? And like when do we know if the deals that we made with these countries that are completely contingent on the tariffs? Are those like going to stand up and be in place? So, I don't think the market is priced in that volatility because it's not that big of a deal. And because I think the market for the majority of the belief is that like the Supreme Court's likely not going to overturn that.</p>
</details>

### 行业动态与投资观察

微软的数据中心支出，即资本支出，在第一季度达到了近350亿美元，其中230亿是与英国初创公司Neoscale的交易，还有与Nebius的190亿美元交易，以及与Iren的100亿美元交易。我还没有仔细研究过与Iren的交易，以充分理解其影响。我不知道它的单位经济效益如何，但股市显然对这笔交易反应积极，认为这是好事。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Microsoft data center spending capital expenditures hit nearly 35 billion in the first quarter 23 billion with UK startup Neoscale and then you had that uh $19 billion deal with uh Nebius and then obviously the $10 billion deal with Iran. I still haven't gone through the Iran deal to fully understand the implications of it. Again, I I don't know how well the uni economics of it worked, but the stock market's obviously reacting in a positive way towards the Iran deal and they're thinking that it's good.</p>

Grab也获得了一系列目标价上调。Evercore给出了8美元，Jefferies从6.80美元上调至7美元，Mizuho从6美元上调至7美元，Benchmark上调至6.60美元。昨晚我看到的几乎所有公司都上调了对Grab的目标价。我昨天又买入了更多Grab的股票。我真的认为财报很强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Grab got a bunch of price target as well. Evercore $8, Jeffree 680 to 70, Mazuo 6 to7, you had Benchmark up to 660. Pretty much every firm that I saw last night raised their price target on Grab. Again, I brought more Grab yesterday. Uh I I really thought the earnings were strong.</p>
</details>

我认为财报强劲的另一个原因是这张图表。Grab三年来首次实现了正的营业收入。这就是我给这个季度评为A-的原因，因为你告诉我一家过去三年都无法实现正营业收入的公司，第一次做到了。我几乎可以打赌，我愿意用我持有的股份赌很多钱，它不会再变回负数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the one of the other reasons I thought was earnings was strong. is this chart right here. Grab had produced positive operating income for the first time in three years. This is why I gave the quarter an A minus because you're telling me a company that has not been able to produce operating income, a positive operating income for the past three years does it for the first time. I I can pretty much bet I I would bet a lot of money and I'm quite literally betting a lot of money with the shares that I have that it's not going to go back to being negative.</p>
</details>

现在他们实现了正的营业收入，我真的怀疑他们会想回到负数状态。这就是为什么这个季度对我来说是不可思议的。不管股价如何，公司的基本面正在变得越来越好，获得了运营杠杆，而且尽管财报非常出色，你还能以折扣价买入。所以，如果他们三年来首次保持营业收入为正，并且这将是公司未来历史的轨迹，这对我来说就意味着这个季度非常强劲，而且我认为随着时间的推移只会变得更强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, now they got the positive operating income. I I really doubt they're going to want to go back to being negative. That's why this quarter was incredible to me. I mean for regardless of the stock price the actual fundamentals of the business are becoming so much better gaining the operating leverage and then you're getting a discount on the price even though the earnings were phenomenal. So if they continue being operating income positive for the first time in three years and that is the trajectory for the rest of the company's history that to me signals that this quarter was very strong and I think it's only going to get stronger over time.</p>

BMR，这只股票昨天真的让人们很恼火。BMR跌至38美元。对于任何持有BMR的人来说，情况都很糟糕。有人称Tom Lee是骗子，说他躲起来了，要离开这个国家，等等。他还调整了自己的领英资料，说他现在在麦当劳工作。向Tom Lee致敬，他像个冠军一样接受了这一切，只是对此一笑置之，开了一些玩笑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">BMR, this one really got people annoyed yesterday. BMR fell to $38. It was ugly out there for anyone who owns BMR. You got people calling Tom Lee a scam and saying he's hiding. He's leaving the country. Yada yada. You got him, you know, readjusting his McDonald's or his LinkedIn profile to say that he now works at McDonald's, which shout out to Tom Lee. He's taking it like a champ and he's just uh he's just laughing about it and uh making some jokes.</p>
</details>

看，我确实认为人们对Tom Lee有点过于激进了。当你是公众人物，做出一个大胆的预测或者你支持一只股票而它下跌时，人们会生你的气。但称他为骗子，我不知道。我认为人们只是因为亏钱而非常沮丧，并试图把气撒在某人身上。我只是不认为这是最健康的投资思维方式。

<p class="english-text">Look, I I do think people are being a bit too aggressive to Tom Lee and and look, it is what it is. When you're when you're a public figure and you make a a bold prediction or you you know, you champion a stock and the stock goes down, people are going to get annoyed at you. But calling him a scam is just I don't know. I think people are really upset that they're losing money and they're trying to take it out on someone. And I just don't think that's the healthiest way to think of investing.</p>

### 市场情绪指标分析

这张图表我也觉得很有趣。这是Ryan Dietrich发布的。AI调查中，看涨者减去看跌者的比例在2025年为负11%。历史上只有三次这个比例低于负10%，而且都发生在熊市中：1990年、2008年和2022年。令人难以置信的是，根据这项调查，2008年看跌者比看涨者多11.1%，与2025年的水平完全相同。我们在2025年处于牛市中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This chart I thought was really interesting as well. This is supposed by Ryan Dietrich. Uh the AI survey, bulls minus bears, is negative 11% in 2025. Only three other times has this ever been negative 10% and they all happened in bare markets. 1990, 2008, and 2022. Incredibly, bears outnumber bulls by 11.1% based on this survey in 2008, the exact same level as 2025. We are in a bull market in 2025.</p>
</details>

但根据AI投资者调查——Tom Lee多次提到这是衡量广大股市中人们是看涨还是看跌的最重要调查之一——你看到的看跌情绪读数与2008年我们经历大衰退时相同。这有点疯狂，伙计，因为我们并没有处于衰退中，失业率在4.3%，公司们正在公布惊人的财报。所以，我认为这确实说明了这是有史以来最被讨厌的牛市，最被讨厌的V型反转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But based on the AI investor survey, which Tom Le has talked about many times is one of the most important surveys to get a gauge on if people are bullish or bearish in the broader stock market, you have the same reading of bearishness as you had in 2008 when we had the great recession, which is kind of crazy, dude, because we're not in a recession unless you know unemployment's at 4.3%. You know, like or the companies are putting up phenomenal earnings. So, it's one of those things that I think really does speak to this most hated bare bull market ever, most hated V-shape.</p>
</details>

因为如果你看到牛市的势头伴随着熊市的心态，那只意味着股市可能有很大的上涨空间。我认为这并非世界上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, because if you are seeing bull market momentum with bare market attitudes, that just means there's a lot of room potentially for the stock market to go higher. And I don't think that's the worst thing in the world.</p>

### 宏观经济与市场展望

他的核心论点是财报强劲。美元走强可能会从其他风险资产交易中夺走一些价值，这些交易在某种程度上是对冲美元持续走强的工具，比如比特币。看看美元指数，我们现在高于100。过去几个月我们每次看这个指数时，它都在97左右。所以我们今年不再下跌11%那么多了，这可能是我们看到一些风险资产波动的原因，尤其是在比特币上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so his kind of core argument right here is that earnings are strong. you are getting some dollar strength which potentially is taking away some of the value from the other riskon trades that are kind of a hedge against the dollar continuing to get stronger like a bitcoin. I mean look at the dollar right here we're above 100. Every time we've checked this for the past couple months it's been like 97 right? So we are not down 11% for the year as much anymore which could be contributing to why we're seeing some risk on volatility especially in Bitcoin.</p>
</details>

在宏观经济担忧的背景下，即美元上涨和其他交易因此做出反应的短期波动性，我们看到了盈利增长。在我们得到英伟达的财报之前，我们无法完全了解盈利的全貌。但根据我们目前看到的盈利情况，似乎很难看空这个市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the midst of those macroeconomic concerns around kind of the short-term nature of the volatility with the dollar going up and other trades reacting as a result of the of the Dixie going higher, you have earnings growth. And until we get Nvidia, we're not going to to fully understand what the earnings picture looks like. But based on the earnings picture we've seen so far, it just seems like it's hard to fade this market.</p>
</details>

Evercore甚至表示，到2026年，标普500指数可能会远超8000点，仅仅是基于这些公司继续执行、继续表现、继续回购股票、继续在AI成为支撑力量的情况下整体提振市场的想法。如果这不放缓，那么我们似乎将继续获得更多动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Evercore even said by 2026 we could be pushing well above 8,000 on the S&P 500 just based on the idea that these companies continue to execute, continue to perform, continue to buy back their stock, continue to overall lift the market as AI becomes the tailbone. And if that doesn't slow down, then it seems like we're going to continue to get a bit more momentum.</p>

### 其他市场新闻与事件

民主党领导人致信特朗普，要求会面。舒默和杰弗里斯寻求会面以结束政府停摆。好的，也许这意味着本周末我们将在政府停摆问题上取得一些进展。特朗普刚刚表示，我们必须尽快让政府重新开门。这正在影响股市，但截至周五，股市已多次创下新高，而且还会再次创下新高。这仅仅是个开始，因为现在正在建设的这些工厂，它们开始投产了。我们从未见过这样的事情。这是一场繁荣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Democratic leaders write letter to Trump demanding a meeting. Schumer Jeffrey seek meeting to end government shutdown. Okay, maybe that means by the end of this week we are going to get some level of progress on the shutdown. Trump right now just said we have to get the government back open soon. It's affecting the stock market now, but the stock market as of Friday has hit many highs and it will again. This is just the beginning because when these plants are being built right now, they're starting to open up. We've never seen anything like this. There's a boom.</p>
</details>

我们现在正式进入了有史以来最长的政府停摆期，36天。我们已经超过了2018年的记录。根据几位参议员昨天的说法，以及今天民主党致特朗普的这封信，我确实认为到本周末，他们至少有很大机会举行一次更重要的会议，因为到目前为止，没有人希望这种情况继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are now in the official um largest shutdown. We're officially in the largest shutdown ever. 36 days. We have passed 2018. And so based on what a couple senators said yesterday and based on this uh letter from the Democrats today for Trump, I I do think by the end of the week there is a decent chance they at least have a bigger meeting because no one at this point wants to continue this going.</p>
</details>

昨天，一些特斯拉影响者发布了一个重要头条，呼吁将他们的股票从嘉信理财（Schwab）撤出，以防嘉信理财投票反对董事会的薪酬方案。Sawyer Merritt、Jason Debolt等特斯拉社区的许多大人物都发声了。他们说：“各位，我们准备将我们的股票撤出这个平台。”然后，嘉信理财就特斯拉的代理投票发表声明称：“我们将投票支持董事会。”这真是太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yesterday there was a big headline for some Tesla influencers to take off their shares from Schwab in case Schwab voted with uh or against the board for the compensation package. And Sawyer Mera, Jason Debolt, a lot of these big people in the Tesla community, they put their voices out there. They said, "You guys, we are ready to take our shares off the platform." And then Schwab issues a statement on the Tesla proxy and says, "We will be voting in favor with the board." This was pretty crazy. This was pretty crazy to see.</p>
</details>

看到散户投资者团结起来真是太不可思议了。甚至Vlad也帮了忙。Vlad说：“嘿，对于想离开嘉信理财并把特斯拉股票转到Robin Hood的人，我们提供匹配奖励。”他其实不必这么做，因为嘉信理财最终屈服了。但他火上浇油地说：“我们是否为想离开的人提供匹配奖励？”我想嘉信理财立刻就觉得：“是的，绝对不行。我们绝不能让Robin Hood从我们平台拿走价值数十亿美元的特斯拉股票。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it was quite incredible to see retail investors come together. Even Vlad helped out. Vlad said, "Hey, we'll give anyone a match who wants to leave uh Schwab and bring their Tesla shares on to Robin Hood." and he didn't really have to, you know, do that uh because Schwab ended up capitulating. But the fact that he put some fuel on the fire and said, "Do we do we do a match for people that want to leave?" I think Schwab immediately was like, "Yeah, there's no way. There's no freaking way we're going to let Robin to take billions of dollars worth of Tesla off the platform."</p>
</details>

这显示了散户的力量，也显示了散户可以多么成熟。特斯拉从一开始就是一个散户的故事。散户投资者比机构投资者更了解这个故事。所以，散户投资者支持埃隆，因为他们希望他因其取得的巨大财务成功和为众多投资者提供的股东价值而获得报酬，看到他们团结起来做这件事真的很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it goes to show the power of retail. It goes to show how sophisticated retail can be. And you know, Tesla is a retail story since the beginning. Retail investors have understood the story way better than institutions. And so the fact that retail investors are sticking up for Elon because they want him to get paid for the monumental level of financial success that he has and shareholder value that he has provided to so many investors, it is really cool to see them come together and do this.</p>
</details>

股东大会将在明天举行。我不确定我是否会直播。根据时间安排，我会尽量直播。我们将看看XAI的投票是否会通过，以及最终埃隆的薪酬方案是否会通过。如果通过了，那么埃隆就有可能在特斯拉工作期间赚到一万亿美元，这有点疯狂，但这就是我们明天将要看到的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So very very dope to see this play out. And the shareholder meeting will be tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'll be live for it. I think based on the timing I'll try to be live and uh we will see if the XAI vote goes through and then ultimately Elon's compensation package goes through and if it does then there you go you've got Elon potentially setting himself up to make a trillion dollar working at Tesla which is kind of crazy but that is what we're going to see tomorrow as it comes through.</p>

### 今日财报前瞻与市场开盘

Robin Hood今天有财报。对于Hood来说，这将是重要的一天。我们周一已经做了Hood的预览并讨论过。我认为Hood会表现出色，可能会达到12亿美元。我不知道股价会怎么样。我认为股价有大约8%的隐含波动。如果他们业绩出色，我认为股价应该会上涨。但话又说回来，该股正处于历史高位交易。它是标普500指数中表现最好的股票。那么，它是否值得获得更高的溢价？这就要看Robin Hood今天能否拿出必要的业绩来实现了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right we got the market open in about 3 minutes. Robin Hood does have earnings today. It's going to be a massive day for Hood. We already did our Hood preview on Monday and uh talked about it. I think Hood's going to crush probably getting at 1.2 billion. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I think there's about an 8% move on the stock implied. I think the stock should go higher if they crush it. But then again, the stock is trading at all time highs. It is the best performing stock in the S&P 500. So, does it deserve to get a higher premium? That's going to be up to Robin today to really put up the results that are necessary to make this happen.</p>
</details>

除此之外，还有Duolingo、AppLovin、ARM、Fortinet、ELF、Joby、EOSE、Snapchat、DoorDash、Lyft、FICO、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Qualcomm。今天有很多公司发布财报。所以我们将报道Robin Hood，但我们也会在收盘后关注所有这些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, we are we're going to have to see, but it's going to be exciting to see their earnings. On top of that, you have Dualingo, you have AppLoving, you have ARM, you have Forinet, ELF, Joby, EOSE, I know a lot of people like that energy name, Snapchat, Door Dash, Lyft, FICO, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, um, uh, OQ, Qualcomm. I mean, you've got a lot of companies, lots and lots and lots of companies that are reporting today. So, we're going to be covering Robin Hood, but we'll be looking at all those companies as well after the bell.</p>
</details>

我们将会看到，这种牛市势头能否通过小公司继续蔓延。因为如果能继续，那么我认为，随着我们接近年底，标普500指数达到7000点是一个真实的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we're gonna see if we can continue getting a lot of this bull market momentum spreading through the smaller companies because if it can continue then you know I think there is a a real argument for S&P 7000 as we get towards the end of the year.</p>
</details>

好了，我们还有20秒。感谢大家来到这里。今天是11月5日，星期三。昨晚的隔夜市场相当惨烈。我们已经恢复了相当一部分，尤其是在加密货币领域。所以现在我们将看看市场能否继续保持这种上涨势头。股市现在开盘了。

### 盘中动态与个股表现

谷歌开盘上涨0.5%，报278美元。Palantir再次下跌，昨天曾跌至181美元，现在是189.19美元。所以Palantir开盘下跌，但比昨晚的低点要高。标普500指数转跌。AMD下跌2%。SoFi报29.59美元，上涨。Grab上涨0.5%，报5.82美元。Robin Hood上涨1.7%，昨晚曾跌至130美元。昨晚对很多股票来说都相当激烈，但这只股票正在恢复，试图回到140美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The googs opens up at 278. That's up half a percent on the day. There you go. The googs 278.98. Palanteer goes down again. Paler was at 181 yesterday. Pal right here at 18919. So you got pounder opening red, but it is up from where it was last night. S&P 500 goes red 675 AMD down 2%. SoFi 2959 that's up. Grab right there up half a percent that's at 582. Google 278. Robin Hood 1.7%. Robin Hood got to 130 last night. So again last night was a bit aggressive for a lot of these names but that one recovering trying to get back up to 140.</p>
</details>

Lemonade财报非常出色，股价上涨13%。Unity上涨18%，现在涨幅收窄至11%，回落了7%。所以Unity上涨11%，Lemonade上涨14%。Zeta上涨13%。Zeta股价达到19美元。几个月前Zeta也曾到过19美元。所以它有点回到了之前的位置。这只股票一直被困在17到19美元的区间。大约六周前，九月初，它曾突破到21美元。但现在它在这个区间内盘整，但从16美元上涨13%。他们的财报非常出色，所以他们绝对值得上涨。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lemonade they had a massive earnings. They are up 13%. 13% move on Lemonade getting a big move right there. Unity Unity is up 18. It was up 18, now it's up 11, losing 7%. So, Unity up 11, Lemonade up 14. Zeta 13% on Zeta. There you go. Zeta at 19. Now Zeta was at 19 a couple months ago. So or a couple weeks ago. So it's kind of getting back to where it was. This one's been kind of stuck between that 17 and $19 range. broke out to 21 about what was it 6 weeks ago, early September. Um, but now this one is kind of chilling in that range, but a 13% move from 16. I mean, they crushed earnings, so they definitely deserve a move. And you're seeing that right here.</p>
</details>

英伟达转跌。今天早上有来自中国的头条新闻说，中国地方政府正在强制中国公司使用中国芯片。他们其实别无选择，因为我们不卖给他们任何芯片。但中国政府正在把确保华为、腾讯、阿里巴巴、京东等公司继续使用国产芯片作为更优先的事项，这显然对英伟达和AMD不利。但如果我们本来就不给他们芯片，那么我不知道这会对股票的看法产生多大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia goes red. There was a headline this morning from China that said that Chinese state governments are uh forcing Chinese companies to use Chinese chips. They kind of don't have a choice because we're not selling them any chips. But the Chinese government is kind of making it a bigger priority to make sure the Huawei's, the 10 cents, the Babas of the world, the JDs continue to use state manufacturer chips, which obviously is not good for Nvidia AMD, but if we weren't going giving them our chips anyway, then I don't know if it's going to have that much of an impact in terms of the perception of the stock.</p>
</details>

### 市场展望与总结

我认为未来两周会更加震荡和盘整。我们在等待英伟达的财报。未来几周除了政府重新开放之外，没有真正的催化剂。当政府重新开放时，当然会是利好，但这会很快被市场消化。除了几周后英伟达的财报，没有其他重大的财报了。所有真正重要的财报都已经发布了。选举也结束了。民主党昨晚在全国范围内大获全胜。Mandani现在是纽约市长。所以那种不知道谁会赢的波动性已经消失了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the next two weeks are going to be a little bit more choppy consolidation. We're waiting for Nvidia earnings. Like there's not really a catalyst over the next couple weeks outside of the government reopening, which okay, when that happens, sure, that'll be bullish, but like that'll be priced in relatively soon. Um there's no massive earnings outside of Nvidia in a couple weeks. Every really important earnings has already happened. The elections are over. Democrats clean sweep across the country last night. Mdani is now the mayor of New York. So that volatility of no of not knowing who's going to win, that's done.</p>
</details>

所以我想在接下来的两周里，重要的事情是什么？美联储利率委员会要到12月才开会。当政府重新开放时，我们可能会得到更多的劳动力市场数据，但我们可能会看到这些股票横盘整理，以消化它们的一些势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I guess over the next two weeks, what's the big thing? Fed rate committee is not till December. I guess we'll get some more labor market data when the government reopens, but we might have these stocks just kind of go sideways to get some of their momentum baked in.</p>
</details>
