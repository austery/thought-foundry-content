### 特朗普关税最后期限与全球市场反应

本周市场紧张不安，因为唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）就美国关税进行的贸易谈判所设的8月1日最后期限终于到期。特朗普此前已宣布对从美国许多最大贸易伙伴进口的商品征收关税，贸易谈判代表们争分夺秒地争取在最后期限前达成临时协议或延期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Markets were on edge this week as Donald Trump’s August 1st deadline for trade negotiations on US tariffs finally ran out. Trump has already announced tariffs on goods imported from many of America’s largest trading partners, as trade negotiators rushed to strike last-minute deals or extensions before time ran out.</p>
</details>

这一最后期限是在特朗普于4月2日首次宣布其进口商品“解放日”关税清单120多天后到来的。尽管有所延迟，特朗普政府现在似乎已准备好对那些未能在周五截止日期前达成协议的国家推出新的关税税率。白宫新闻秘书卡罗琳·利维特（Karoline Leavitt）宣布，美国18个主要贸易伙伴中已有三分之二达成协议，并已向另外17个国家发出了信函。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The deadline came more than 120 days after Trump first announced his list of “Liberation Day” tariffs on imported goods on April 2nd. Despite delays, the Trump administration now looks ready to roll out new tariff rates for the countries that didn’t manage to secure a deal before the Friday deadline. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that two-thirds of the US’s 18 major trading partners already have a deal, and that letters have been sent to an additional 17 nations.</p>
</details>

白宫表示，尚未达成贸易协议或未收到新关税税率信函的国家，将在周五午夜前收到特朗普政府的通知。**台湾**（Taiwan: 全球最重要的半导体出口地）被征收了20%的关税。对作为美国历史盟友和主要贸易伙伴的**加拿大**（Canada）的关税提高到35%。**印度**（India）被征收25%的关税，而**瑞士**（Switzerland）则被征收39%的关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The White House said that countries that have not struck a trade deal, or have not received a letter with a new tariff rate, will hear from the Trump administration by midnight on Friday. Taiwan - the world’s most important semiconductor exporter - was hit with a 20% tariff. Tariffs were raised on Canada, a historic US ally and major trading partner, to 35 per cent. India was hit with a 25 per cent tariff and Switzerland with 39 percent.</p>
</details>

特朗普表示，此次他不会延长最后期限。本周早些时候，他在自己的推特版本——**Truth Social**（Truth Social: 特朗普创立的社交媒体平台）上发文称：“8月1日的最后期限就是8月1日的最后期限——它将坚定不移，不会延长。对美国来说是伟大的一天！！！”周四，他宣布将对**墨西哥**（Mexico）提高关税的计划推迟90天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump said that he would not be extending the deadline this time around. Tweeting “THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE – IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!” on his version of Twitter – which is called Truth Social, earlier this week. On Thursday he announced that he would delay higher tariffs on Mexico by 90 days.</p>
</details>

本周四午夜，**美国海关和边境保护局**（US Customs and Border Protection）开始向进口商征收新的关税，税率从10%到50%不等，对大多数国家的某些行业，如药品、铜、钢铁和铝，还加征了额外关税。**耶鲁大学预算实验室**（Yale University Budget Lab）周一宣布，美国消费者面临18.2%的有效关税税率——这是自1934年以来的最高水平——这意味着普通家庭在2025年将额外增加2400美元的成本。这项分析是在宣布对印度加征关税和推迟对墨西哥提高关税之前发布的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At midnight this Thursday, US Customs and Border Protection began charging importers the new duties, which range from 10 percent to 50 percent, with additional tariffs being applied to certain industries like pharmaceutical products, copper, steel and aluminum for most countries. The Yale University Budget Lab announced on Monday that U.S. consumers face an effective tariff rate of 18.2% - the highest rate since 1934 – which means that the average household will see additional costs of $2,400 in 2025. That analysis came out before the announcement of additional tariffs on India and the announcement delaying higher tariffs on Mexico.</p>
</details>

本周早些时候，美中谈判代表同意推迟达成协议的最后期限，此前双方在本周的谈判中未能在诸多争议领域找到解决方案。

### 英美贸易协议：地缘政治结盟的新原型

早在4月，特朗普在接受《**时代杂志**》（Time Magazine）采访时曾声称已达成“200多项协议”，贸易顾问彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）也曾表示“90天内达成90项协议”是可能的。然而，美国远未达到这一目标，在120天内仅达成了八项协议，其中包括与27个成员国组成的**欧盟**（European Union）的一项协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done “over 200 deals” in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that “90 deals in 90 days” was possible. The country has fallen far short of that, with only eight deals in 120 days, including one with the 27-member European Union.</p>
</details>

英国是第一个在5月与特朗普达成贸易协议的国家，同意对从英国进口的大多数商品征收10%的统一税率，由美国买家支付。这可能是特朗普最容易达成的协议——因为美英之间存在有利的现有贸易动态，英国对美国的商品贸易顺差非常小——而且似乎特朗普优先考虑商品而非服务，因为他2025年的贸易政策议程明确呼吁建立“生产型经济”，强调制造业、农业和能源是美国繁荣的支柱。英国和美国一样，存在**贸易逆差**（Trade deficit: 进口商品和服务多于出口），实际上，它是全球第三大贸易逆差国，仅次于印度和美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The UK was the first country to strike a trade deal with Trump back in May, agreeing to a flat 10 per cent tax which US buyers will pay on most goods imported from the UK. This was possibly the easiest deal to strike for Trump – due to the favorable preexisting trade dynamics between the US and the UK – where Britain only ran a very small trade surplus in goods with the United States – and it would appear that Trump prioritizes goods over services as his 2025 Trade Policy Agenda explicitly calls for a “production economy”, emphasizing manufacturing, agriculture, and energy as the backbone of American prosperity. Britain – like the US runs a Trade deficit, meaning that it imports more goods and services than it exports. In fact it runs the third largest trade deficit in the world – behind only India and the United States.</p>
</details>

协议宣布几天内，《**金融时报**》（Financial Times）报道称，中国对此感到不满，认为该协议旨在将中国产品挤出英国供应链。中国外交部表示，国家间协议不应针对其他国家是“基本原则”。据《金融时报》报道，中国已警告其他国家不要与美国签署威胁中国利益的贸易协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Within days of the deal being announced, the Financial Times reported that China was upset that it had been structured to squeeze Chinese products out of British supply chains. Chinas Foreign Ministry said that it was a “basic principle” that agreements between countries should not target other nations. According to the FT, China has warned other countries against signing trade deals with the US that threaten Chinese interests.</p>
</details>

美英贸易协议被特朗普总统形容为“全面而综合”——它维持了对大多数英国进口商品征收10%的税率，特别是，它规定从英国进口的汽车在美国将面临10%的关税，这低于美国人从欧盟和日本进口汽车所需支付的15%的税率。该协议仅适用于每年进口的前10万辆英国汽车，这大约是美国人目前从英国购买的汽车数量，超出该配额的每辆车都将面临25%的税收，以阻止销量增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The US-UK trade deal - was described by President Trump as being “full and comprehensive” - it kept in place the 10 per cent tax on most British imports – in particular – it specified that cars imported from the UK would face a 10% tariff in the United States, which is lower than the 15% rate that Americans will have to pay on cars imported from the EU and Japan. The deal only applies to the first 100,000 British cars imported per year, which is approximately the number of cars that Americans already buy from Britain and every vehicle sold above that quota will be hit with a 25% tax, discouraging any increase in sales.</p>
</details>

令中国不满的协议特点是，美国购买钢铁和汽车的关税减免条款中包含要求英国“迅速满足”美国对出口到美国的钢铁和铝产品“供应链安全”的要求。中方担心这可能意味着他们会被排除在向销往美国的英国公司供货的范围之外。英国政府驳斥了关于该贸易协议可能损害中国利益的说法，称协议中“不存在对中国投资的否决权”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The feature of the deal that upset China was that the tariff relief for steel and cars bought by Americans included conditions requiring the UK to "promptly meet" US demands on the "security of the supply chains" of steel and aluminium products exported to America. The Chinese worry that this could mean that they could be excluded from supplying British firms that sell to the US. The British government pushed back against suggestions the trade deal could be damaging to China – saying that there was no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment" in the deal.</p>
</details>

一位英国政府发言人告诉**英国广播公司**（BBC），与美国的协议“符合国家利益，旨在确保关键行业的数千个就业岗位，保护英国企业，并为未来更大的贸易奠定基础”。他补充说，协议中的“任何外部条款”都“并非旨在损害与任何第三国互利的经济关系”。这被广泛解读为指的是**英国钢铁公司**（British Steel），该公司此前一直由中国的**敬业集团**（Jingye Group）所有，直到今年早些时候。尽管英国政府接管了该公司的运营控制权，以防止其斯肯索普高炉关闭，但敬业集团仍是其合法所有者。根据协议条款，来自此类设施的钢铁可能无法享受关税减免，除非其所有权结构进行调整以符合美国标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A British government spokesperson told the BBC that the agreement with the US was "in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future". Adding that “any external provisions" in the agreement were "not designed to undermine mutually beneficial economic relations with any third country.” This was widely interpreted as a reference to British Steel, which had been owned by China’s Jingye Group until earlier this year. Although the UK government took operational control of the company to prevent the closure of its Scunthorpe blast furnaces, Jingye remains the legal owner. Under the terms of the deal, steel from such facilities may not qualify for tariff relief unless ownership is restructured to meet U.S. standards.</p>
</details>

这种做法反映了特朗普领导下美国贸易政策可能出现的更广泛转变。**关税**（Tariffs: 一国海关对进出口商品征收的税金）不再仅仅是保护国内产业的工具，它们正被用作强制推行地缘政治结盟的机制。从这个意义上说，英国协议可能是一种新型贸易协议的原型：它奖励那些符合美国战略目标的国家，并惩罚那些与中国有经济瓜葛的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This approach reflects what might be a broader shift in U.S. trade policy under Trump. Tariffs are no longer just a tool for protecting domestic industry—they are being used as a mechanism for enforcing geopolitical alignment. The UK deal, in this sense, might be a prototype for a new kind of trade agreement: one that rewards compliance with U.S. strategic objectives and penalizes economic entanglement with China.</p>
</details>

### 中国的应对：自给自足与外交策略

北京对英国协议的反应迅速而尖锐。中国官员警告其他国家不要与美国签署威胁中国利益的协议，中国也加快了从国内供应链中移除外国零部件的努力。其目标是使中国免受未来贸易中断的影响，并减少对外国技术和投入的依赖。这一战略与中国长期以来的“**双循环政策**”（Dual Circulation policy: 旨在以国内大循环为主体、国内国际双循环相互促进的经济发展格局）大体一致，该政策旨在促进国内消费和技术自给自足，同时保持与全球市场的选择性接触。英美协议以及其他类似协议，可能强化了北京减少受外国政府施压风险的决心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Beijing’s reaction to the UK deal was swift and pointed. Chinese officials warned other countries that they deal with against signing agreements with the US that threaten Chinese interests and China accelerated its efforts to remove foreign components from domestic supply chains. The goal being - to insulate China from future trade disruptions and reduce dependency on foreign technology and inputs. This strategy broadly aligns with China’s long standing “dual circulation” policy, which aims to boost domestic consumption and technological self-sufficiency while maintaining selective engagement with global markets. The UK–US deal, and others like it, have possibly reinforced Beijing’s determination to reduce its risk of being pressured by foreign governments.</p>
</details>

中国还通过加强与东南亚、**全球南方**（Global South: 指发展中国家和新兴经济体，通常位于南半球）以及**金砖国家**（BRICS: 巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国、南非五个新兴市场国家组成的合作机制）集团内国家的接触，提供替代性的贸易和投资伙伴关系，来外交回应美国的压力。与此同时，中国继续与美国进行贸易谈判，导致5月达成了一项90天的休战协议，暂时将中国商品的关税从高达145%降至约40%。然而，这一休战协议是脆弱的。特朗普将进一步的关税削减与在无关问题上的合作挂钩，这使得人们难以判断一旦达成协议是会得到遵守，还是会再次随意重新谈判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China has also been responding diplomatically to US pressure by stepping up engagement with countries in Southeast Asia, the Global South and within the BRICS bloc, offering alternative trade and investment partnerships. At the same time, it has continued trade talks with the U.S., resulting in a 90-day truce in May that temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from as high as 145% to around 40%. That truce, however, is fragile. Trump has tied further tariff reductions to cooperation on unrelated issues, making it difficult to know if a deal when struck will be stuck to or renegotiated again on a whim.</p>
</details>

这种交易性的做法让北京非常警惕。中国官员表示，他们将直接向英国和美国提出关切，但正在避免事态升级——这可能是为了保留谈判空间，或避免在今年晚些时候可能举行的特朗普-习近平峰会前造成干扰。尽管其他亚洲国家可能对中国感到不安，但他们看到中国企业仍会投资其国家，而美国企业则在向北美收缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This transactional approach has left Beijing very wary. Chinese officials have indicated they will raise concerns directly with the UK and U.S. but are avoiding escalation—possibly to preserve room for negotiation or to avoid disruption ahead of a potential Trump–Xi summit later this year. While other Asian countries may be nervous of China, they see that Chinese companies will still invest in their countries while American businesses are retrenching to North America.</p>
</details>

### 欧盟与美国协议：不对称性与内部摩擦

欧盟与华盛顿几天前敲定的协议范围更广。它对约70%的欧盟对美出口商品征收15%的关税，包括药品、半导体和汽车。作为交换，欧盟承诺购买7500亿美元的美国能源，并向美国工业投资6000亿美元。钢铁和铝的出口受到配额制度的限制，超出配额的部分将面临50%的关税。作为回报，欧盟决定不对美国商品征收任何关税。这项协议的单边性质有些令人惊讶——因为欧洲和美国经济规模相当，而且贸易关系是双向相互关联的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The EU’s agreement with Washington, finalized a few days ago, was broader in scope. It imposed a 15% tariff on roughly 70% of EU exports to the U.S., including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and cars. In exchange, the EU pledged to buy $750 billion dollars in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion dollars in American industry. Steel and aluminum exports were capped under a quota system, with excess volumes facing a 50% tariff. In return – The EU decided to put no tariffs on US goods. The one sided nature of this deal is somewhat surprising – as the European and US economies are fairly similar in size - and the trade relationships are interrelated in both directions.</p>
</details>

本·霍尔（Ben Hall）在**Unhedged Podcast**（Unhedged Podcast: 一个金融经济播客节目）上指出，美欧贸易协议的不对称性源于欧盟自身的结构和哲学本质。欧盟的成立旨在促进成员国之间的自由贸易和市场自由化，这使其天生不愿征收关税或采取激进的贸易报复措施。这种基本理念，加上欧盟分散的决策过程——国家利益分歧常常阻碍统一行动——使得欧洲无法果断回应美国的保护主义立场。结果，欧盟接受了一项单边协议，将内部团结和稳定置于经济影响力之上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben Hall argued on the Unhedged Podcast that the asymmetry of the US-EU trade deal stems from the structural and philosophical nature of the European Union itself. The EU was founded to promote free trade and market liberalization among its member states, making it inherently reluctant to impose tariffs or engage in aggressive trade retaliation. This foundational ethos, combined with the EU’s fragmented decision-making process—where divergent national interests often hinder unified action—left Europe unable to respond decisively to the protectionist stance of the US. As a result, the EU accepted a one-sided deal, prioritizing internal unity and stability over economic leverage.</p>
</details>

巴黎和柏林的批评者迅速将该协议描述为“投降”。《金融时报》编辑委员会将其描述为“为美国总统的新世界秩序盖章”，认为欧洲认可了特朗普的霸凌贸易议程。《**经济学人**》（The Economist: 英国知名新闻评论周刊）则提出了更务实的看法，认为欧盟获得了与日本条款对等的地位，并保留了对数字服务的监管自主权。它认为，真正的问题在于欧洲内部的摩擦，而非协议本身的不对称性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Critics in Paris and Berlin were quick to describe the deal as capitulation. The FT’s editorial board described it as “rubber stamping the U.S. president’s new world order,” arguing that Europe had validated Trump’s bullying trade agenda. The Economist - offered a more pragmatic take, arguing that the EU had secured parity with Japan’s terms and retained its regulatory autonomy over digital services. The real problem, it argued, lies in Europe’s internal frictions—not in the asymmetry of the deal.</p>
</details>

欧盟的谈判立场因内部 B分歧而削弱。法国——像美国一样长期存在贸易逆差——反对农业方面的让步。德国——存在贸易顺差——则试图保护其汽车工业。而最关心安全保障的东欧国家则根本不愿挑战华盛顿。结果是形成了一个支离破碎的阵线，使得布鲁塞尔不愿强硬推进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The EU’s negotiating position was weakened by internal divisions. France – which like the US runs a persistent trade deficit pushed back against agricultural concessions. Germany which runs a trade surplus - sought to protect its car industry. Eastern European states, who are most concerned with security guarantees, were reluctant to challenge Washington at all. The result was a fragmented front that left Brussels unwilling to push hard.</p>
</details>

### 企业应对与经济影响

企业对特朗普关税制度的反应褒贬不一。**福特**（Ford）在7月报告了意外的季度亏损，称关税相关成本达8亿美元，并警告全年将遭受20亿美元的打击。相比之下，**宝马**（BMW）则淡化了影响。由于其在南卡罗来纳州拥有主要的美国生产基地，它部分地免受了最严重的影响。**苹果**（Apple）——这家受特朗普贸易和关税议程打击最严重的公司——自“解放日”公告以来市值蒸发了近7000亿美元，但本周却公布了创纪录的季度收益。该公司首席财务官表示，“有证据表明”本季度初美国客户提前购买以规避美国关税，从而提振了销售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The corporate response to Trump’s tariff regime has been mixed. Ford reported a surprise quarterly loss in July, citing $800 million dollars in tariff-related costs and warning of a $2 billion dollar hit for the year. BMW, in contrast, has downplayed the fallout. With a major U.S. production base in South Carolina, it has been partially shielded from the worst effects. Apple – the company that has been most heavily hit by Trump’s trade and tariff agenda lost almost $700 billion dollars in market cap since the Liberation Day announcement posted blockbuster quarterly earnings this week. The companies CFO said there had been “some evidence” that sales were boosted by US customers buying early to get ahead of US tariffs early in the quarter.</p>
</details>

其他行业也感受到了压力。半导体公司警告称，新关税可能会扰乱全球供应链，而这些供应链已因出口管制和地缘政治紧张局势而面临压力。制药公司，其中许多依赖中国的活性成分，正在重新评估其采购策略。贸易协会对某些协议缺乏明确性表示担忧。在一些案例中，关税减免与不透明的“国家安全”审查挂钩，使企业对合规性感到不确定。大型企业正在推迟投资决策，等待新规则如何执行的指导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other sectors are also feeling the strain. Semiconductor firms have warned that the new tariffs could disrupt global supply chains already under pressure from export controls and geopolitical tensions. Pharmaceutical companies, many of which rely on Chinese active ingredients, are reassessing sourcing strategies. Trade associations have expressed concern about the lack of clarity in some deals. In several cases, tariff relief is tied to opaque “national security” reviews, leaving firms uncertain about compliance. Big businesses are delaying their investment decisions while they wait for guidance on how the new rules will be enforced.</p>
</details>

### 法律挑战与“协议”的临时性

尽管特朗普政府宣扬了一系列新的贸易“协议”，但法律专家和立法者认为这些并非真正的贸易协定。根据《**美国宪法**》（U.S. Constitution），只有国会才有权规范与外国的商业活动并批准具有约束力的贸易协定。相反，政府依赖行政协议和紧急权力——特别是《**国际紧急经济权力法**》（International Emergency Economic Powers Act: 赋予总统在国家紧急状态下规范国际经济交易的权力）——单方面征收关税并谈判关税调整。批评者认为，这些安排缺乏法律依据，并绕过了立法程序。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While the Trump administration has touted a flurry of new trade “deals”, legal experts and lawmakers argue these are not actually real trade agreements. Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to approve binding trade agreements. Instead, the administration has relied on executive agreements and emergency powers—particularly the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — to unilaterally impose tariffs and negotiate tariff adjustments. These arrangements, critics argue, lack legal standing and bypass the legislative process.</p>
</details>

上个月，参议院财政委员会（Senate Finance Committee）资深成员罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）参议员致函美国贸易代表詹米森·格里尔（Jamieson Greer），提出谴责，称“宪法赋予国会‘征收……关税’和‘规范与外国商业’的独有权力……总统在未经国会批准的情况下，无权签订具有约束力的贸易协定”。他敦促政府“尊重国会在贸易方面的宪法权力以及制定美国法律的权力”，并警告说，持续的规避可能引发法律挑战，并损害美国贸易政策的合法性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued a rebuke last month in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer – saying - “The Constitution provides Congress with sole authority ‘to lay and collect . . . duties’ and ‘to regulate commerce with foreign nations’... The President lacks the authority to enter into binding trade agreements absent approval from Congress” He urged the administration to “respect Congress’s constitutional authority over trade and power to write U.S. law,” warning that continued circumvention could provoke legal challenges and undermine the legitimacy of U.S. trade policy.</p>
</details>

尽管特朗普政府将其最近的行政安排称为贸易“协议”，但美国的许多贸易伙伴仍将其视为临时性的、受政治影响的，而非具有约束力的国际协定。英国、日本和越南等国已签署了白宫所谓的“框架协议”或“关税谅解”，但这些并非经立法机构批准的条约。相反，它们是在压力下谈判达成的临时安排，通常是为了换取关税减免或豁免于更广泛的美国措施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While the Trump administration has framed its recent executive arrangements as trade “deals,” many of America’s trading partners are still treating them as provisional and politically contingent, rather than as binding international agreements. Countries like the UK, Japan, and Vietnam have entered into what the White House calls “framework agreements” or “tariff understandings,” but these are not treaties ratified by legislatures. Instead, they are temporary arrangements negotiated under pressure, often in exchange for reduced tariffs or exemptions from broader U.S. measures.</p>
</details>

欧洲官员尤其谨慎。一位不愿透露姓名的欧盟高级贸易官员将2025年7月的协议描述为“战术性暂停，而非战略性解决方案”。同样，**日本经济产业省**（Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry）发布声明指出，其与美国的协议“仍有待进一步谈判和国内审查”。这种模糊性反映了一个更广泛的担忧：这些协议可能因特朗普情绪变化、美国法院或未来政府而逆转或失效。一家联邦上诉法院目前正在审查特朗普利用紧急权力实施全面关税的合法性，分析师警告称，这些协议最终可能被裁定为“非法”。实际上，许多国家正在对冲风险——接受临时协议，同时为进一步的波动做准备。正如一位贸易律师告诉**美国有线电视新闻网**（CNN）的那样：“这些不是贸易协议，它们是停火协议。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">European officials have been particularly cautious. A senior EU trade official, speaking anonymously, described the July 2025 agreement as “a tactical pause, not a strategic settlement.” Similarly, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry issued a statement noting that its agreement with the U.S. “remains subject to further negotiation and domestic review” This ambiguity reflects a broader concern: that these deals could be reversed or invalidated by a change in Trumps mood, by U.S. courts or by a future administration. A federal appeals court is currently reviewing the legality of Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs, with analysts warning that the deals may ultimately be ruled “illegal” In effect, many countries are hedging their bets—accepting temporary agreements while preparing for further volatility. As one trade lawyer told CNN, “These aren’t trade deals. They’re ceasefires.”</p>
</details>

### 通胀后果与关税的税收功能

特朗普关税的通胀后果开始显现。尽管美国政府一直声称是其他国家支付这些关税，但实际情况并非如此。关税推高了美国消费者进口商品的价格，并可能损害外国出口商——因为更高的价格可能导致销量下降——但美国人确实支付了这项税款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The inflationary consequences of Trump’s tariffs are beginning to surface. While the US administration keeps claiming that other countries pay these tariffs, that is just not how they work. The tariffs push up the price of imported goods for American consumers – and can be expected to hurt foreign exporters – as the higher prices will likely lead to lower sales – but Americans do pay this tax.</p>
</details>

美联储主席杰伊·鲍威尔（Jay Powell）——由唐纳德·特朗普在2018年提名——抵制了总统关于大幅降息的呼吁。鲍威尔提到了关税通胀影响的不确定性，其中许多关税税率超过了经济学家此前认为的10%上限。两名美联储理事对不降息的决定表示异议，这是自1993年以来的首次此类分歧。市场将鲍威尔的立场解读为**鹰派**（Hawkish: 货币政策中指主张收紧银根、提高利率以抑制通胀的立场），短期国债收益率上升，美元走强。**摩根大通**（JPMorgan）和**花旗集团**（Citigroup）的分析师警告称，随着企业转嫁更高的投入成本，下半年消费者支出可能进一步疲软。通胀影响不仅限于美国。欧洲各国央行也在密切关注局势，**欧洲央行**（ECB: European Central Bank，负责欧元区货币政策的中央银行）警告称，更高的美国关税可能会蔓延到全球物价。目前，美联储坚守立场——但压力正在增加。

<p class="english-text">Fed Chair Jay Powell – who was nominated by Donald Trump in 2018 has resisted the president’s calls for aggressive rate cuts. Powell cited uncertainty over the inflationary impact of tariffs, many of which exceed the 10% threshold economists had assumed would be the ceiling. Two Fed governors dissented from the decision not to cut rates, marking the first such split since 1993. Markets interpreted Powell’s stance as hawkish, with short-term Treasury yields rising and the dollar rallying. Analysts at JPMorgan and Citigroup have warned that consumer spending could soften further in the second half of the year as businesses pass on higher input costs. The inflationary impact is not limited to the U.S. European central banks are also monitoring the situation closely, with the ECB warning that higher U.S. tariffs could spill over into global prices. For now, the Fed is holding its ground—but the pressure is mounting.</p>

必须提出的问题之一是，特朗普这些关税的总体目标是什么？他是希望达成协议，还是希望利用关税增加收入？答案可能兼而有之。特朗普将每项协议都视为美国工人的胜利，但这些协议也具有财政功能。关税现在每年产生数百亿美元的收入，实际上是对进口商品征收的一种税。这些协议的结构不仅是为了重新平衡贸易流，更是为了强制推行一种新的地缘政治结盟——在这种结盟中，进入美国市场可能取决于你与中国保持距离的程度。

<p class="english-text">One of the questions that must be asked, is what is Trumps overall goal with these tariffs? Is he hoping to strike deals—or hoping to use tariffs to raise revenue? The answer might be both. Trump has framed each agreement as a victory for American workers, but the deals also serve a fiscal function. Tariffs now generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue, effectively acting as a tax on imports. The deals are structured not just to rebalance trade flows, but to enforce a new geopolitical alignment—one in which access to the U.S. market may be contingent on distancing yourself from China.</p>

特朗普的关税政策从未仅仅是为了纠正贸易失衡。尽管他的言论经常援引经济民族主义的语言——保护美国就业、振兴国内制造业——但其行动模式表明，贸易工具的使用范围更广，更具强制性。对墨西哥和加拿大的关税被广泛视为一种权力展示，而非对具体经济不满的回应。

<p class="english-text">Trump’s tariff policy has never been solely about correcting trade imbalances. While his rhetoric often invokes the language of economic nationalism—protecting American jobs, reviving domestic manufacturing—the pattern of his actions suggests a broader, more coercive use of trade tools. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada were widely seen as a demonstration of power rather than a response to specific economic grievances.</p>

在特朗普针对巴西的行动中，这一点体现得最为明显。政府宣布对巴西的铝和农产品出口征收50%的关税，并非为了回应贸易行为，而是为了报复巴西对前总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）的起诉。特朗普谴责巴西的法律程序是出于政治动机，并指责巴西司法机构压制言论自由。这一事件凸显了在特朗普领导下，关税已成为意识形态结盟和个人忠诚的工具，而不仅仅是经济政策工具。

<p class="english-text">Nowhere is this clearer than in Trump’s move against Brazil. The administration announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian aluminum and agricultural exports, not in response to trade practices, but as retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump denounced the Brazilian legal proceedings as politically motivated and accused Brazil’s judiciary of suppressing free speech. This episode underscores how tariffs under Trump have become instruments of ideological alignment and personal loyalty, rather than just as tools of economic policy.</p>

特朗普的做法对全球贸易体系具有重大影响。它损害了**世界贸易组织**（WTO: World Trade Organization，旨在促进全球贸易自由化的国际组织）的**最惠国待遇原则**（Most-Favored-Nation principle: 要求成员国对所有贸易伙伴一视同仁，给予同等贸易优惠），该原则要求各国平等对待所有贸易伙伴并避免歧视。通过向接受美国条件的盟友提供优惠条款，并惩罚那些不接受的国家，特朗普正在用一系列令人困惑的双边协议取代多边主义。

<p class="english-text">Trump’s approach has significant implications for the global trading system. It undermines the WTO’s most-favored-nation principle, which requires countries to treat all trading partners equally and avoid discrimination. By offering preferential terms to allies who accept U.S. conditions—and penalizing those who do not—Trump is replacing multilateralism with a confusing array of bilateral deals.</p>

### 长期影响与政策反思

虽然关税常被视为贸易政策工具，但它们也具有税收功能。根据耶鲁大学预算实验室的估计，美国目前对近一半的进口商品征收关税，每年带来数百亿美元的收入。政府可以随意征收税收，特朗普将大规模的所得税减免与这些关税结合起来，有效地将部分联邦收入负担从国内收入者转移到进口商品的消费者身上。这就引出了一个问题：这是一种有效的征收收入方式吗？经济学家普遍认为，关税是一种**扭曲性税收**（Distortionary taxation: 改变市场价格和资源配置效率的税收）和**累退税**（Regressive taxation: 低收入者负担比例高于高收入者的税收），与所得税等更透明的机制相比，它会提高消费者价格并扰乱供应链。然而对特朗普而言，关税提供了一种政治上强有力的组合，既能创收又能发出民族主义信号。

<p class="english-text">While tariffs are often framed as tools of trade policy, they also function as a form of taxation. According to estimates from Yale’s Budget Lab, the U.S. is now collecting tariffs on nearly half of all imports and bringing in tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually. A government can bring in tax revenue however it wants and Trump has paired sweeping income tax cuts with these tariffs, effectively shifting part of the federal revenue burden from domestic earners to consumers of imported goods. This raises the question of whether this an efficient way to collect revenue? Economists generally argue that tariffs are a distortionary and regressive form of taxation, raising prices for consumers and disrupting supply chains—compared to more transparent mechanisms like income tax. Yet for Trump, tariffs offer a politically potent blend of revenue generation and nationalist signaling.</p>

特朗普的关税闪电战是试图围绕美国影响力重塑全球贸易秩序的尝试。美国的盟友已被卷入一种新的有条件市场准入体系，其中关税税率与遵守美国战略目标挂钩。与此同时，中国正在调整其供应链和外交姿态以作回应。对于企业而言，信息很明确：无摩擦全球贸易的时代已经结束。供应链正在被重新规划，投资决策被推迟，跨境经营成本正在上升。这些协议是否会一成不变还远不清楚——未来几年它们很可能不断被重新谈判。

<p class="english-text">Trump’s tariff blitz is an attempt to reorder global trade around American leverage. Americas allies have been drawn into a new system of conditional market access, where tariff rates are tied to compliance with U.S. strategic objectives. China, meanwhile, is recalibrating its supply chains and diplomatic posture in response. For businesses, the message is clear: the era of frictionless global trade is over. Supply chains are being redrawn, investment decisions are being delayed, and the cost of doing business across borders is rising. It is not at all obvious that these deals are set in stone – they might well be renegotiated constantly in the coming years.</p>

尽管美国持续的贸易失衡确实需要解决，而且将战略性重要制造业**在岸生产**（Onshore manufacturing: 将生产活动从海外迁回本国）有充分的理由，但问题依然存在：当前这种以全面且频繁变动的关税为特征的做法是否正确？关税可以增加收入，特朗普也用它们来抵消所得税减免，但它们是一种非常粗糙的工具。它们扭曲价格，扰乱供应链，并给企业和消费者带来不确定性。进口商品在抵达美国港口前通常要在海上漂浮45天，而关税税率变化莫测，使得进口商只能猜测最终成本——这损害了规划和投资。

<p class="english-text">While something did need to be done about America’s persistent trade imbalances, and there are good arguments for moving strategically important manufacturing onshore, the question remains whether the current approach—marked by sweeping and frequently shifting tariffs—is the right one. Tariffs can raise revenue, and Trump has used them to offset income tax cuts, but they are a very blunt instrument. They distort prices, disrupt supply chains, and create uncertainty for businesses and consumers alike. Imported goods often spend 45 days at sea before reaching U.S. ports, and with tariff rates changing unpredictably, importers are left guessing at final costs—undermining planning and investment.</p>

除此之外，关税是否能实现其振兴美国制造业的既定目标也远不清楚。仅中国的制造业劳动力就超过2.2亿人——比整个美国劳动力还要多——而且美国失业率接近历史低点，吸收大规模**回流**（Reshoring: 将海外生产线或业务迁回本国）的余地有限。正如罗伯特·阿姆斯特朗（Robert Armstrong）在最近的一个播客中正确指出的那样——历史表明，保护主义往往导致生产力下降并扼杀创新。它助长了**寻租**（Rent-seeking: 通过非生产性手段获取经济利益的行为）和规避规则，而非竞争和卓越。如果目标是加强美国经济，那么工具必须谨慎选择，并清楚地了解其长期后果。

<p class="english-text">On top of that, it is far from clear that tariffs will achieve their stated goal of reviving American manufacturing. China’s manufacturing workforce alone numbers over 220 million—more than the entire U.S. labor force—and with American unemployment near historic lows, there is limited slack to absorb large-scale reshoring. As Robert Armstrong rightly observed in a recent podcast – which I’ll link to in the description - history suggests that protectionism tends to lead to lower productivity and stifles innovation. It invites rule-bending and rent-seeking, rather than competition and excellence. If the goal is to strengthen the U.S. economy, then the tools must be chosen with care—and wielded with a clear understanding of their long-term consequences.</p>
