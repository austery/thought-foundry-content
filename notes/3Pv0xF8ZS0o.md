### 市场概览：科技股回调中的健康轮动

好了，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘分析。感谢大家的到来。今天是11月12日，星期三。我们即将进入收盘后的时段。盘后有三家公司发布财报：DLO、思科（Cisco），以及另一家我想不起来了……哦，是 Serve Robotics。所以是 DLO、Serve Robotics 和思科。我们会关注这三家公司。如果有人持有这三家公司中任何一家的头寸，请告诉我，我们将在盘后进行分析。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, welcome back to another episode of the market close. Thank you everybody for being here. It is Wednesday, November 12th. We are getting into the end of the close after the bell. We got three earnings. DLO, um, Cisco, and another one that I can't think of. Oh, Serve Robotics. So, DLO, Serve Robotics, and Cisco. Those are three companies we'll look at. Let me know if anyone has a position in any of those three companies, but we will get to those after the bell.</p>
</details>

朋友们，我们有一些宏观数据要谈，有很多内容。总的来说，今天市场情况如何？肯定是个下跌日，但只是特定股票的下跌日。标普500指数是上涨的，报6833.36点。标普指数是绿的。我不太确定它为什么上涨，我有一些理论，但那些可能让人们不安的个股，比如 Nebus 下跌7%，Corey 下跌3%，Palantir 下跌4%，REN 下跌4%，英伟达（Nvidia）说实话也只是在努力持平。它曾下跌2%，现在仅下跌50美分。所有这些对标普500指数都无关紧要。标普500指数是上涨的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got some macro data, folks. We got a lot to talk about. Overall, what's going on today? It's a red day for sure, but it's a red day in specific names. The S&P 500 is green. 6833.36. We're green on the S&P. I don't know necessarily why we're green. I have some theories about it, but the individual stocks that may be upsetting people like a Nebus that's down 7% or a Corey that's down 3% or a pounder that's down 4%, a REN down 4%, Nvidia is kind of trying to break even to be honest. It was down 2%, now it's barely down 50 cents. None of that matters to the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is green.</p>
</details>

原因可能在于，今天金融板块的摩根大通（JP Morgan）受到了追捧，当天上涨了2%。而礼来（Eli Lilly）则试图创下历史新高，上涨了2.87%。我认为今天首先要指出的是，这感觉像是牛市中一次非常非常健康的波动。尽管 Palantir 目前没有一飞冲天，但看到部分资金流入礼来或摩根大通，或者只是流入消费防御性必需品板块，这并非坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason for this might be because JP Morgan is catching a bid today in the financial sector. JP Morgan up 2% on the day and Eli Lily is trying to get to all-time highs. That's up 2.87%. I think the first thing to start off with on today is that this feels like a very very healthy move in a bull market. Even though pounder is not going to the moon right now to see some of that money go into a Lily or JP Morgan or just consumer defensive staples that is not a bad thing to see.</p>
</details>

事实上，在英伟达下跌的情况下，标普500指数居然能收涨，这真的向我证明了——我们昨天已经看到了一点苗头，但今天我认为是进一步印证了——我们正在经历一轮板块轮动。这种轮动非常健康和正常，看到市场的其他部分开始参与进来是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that we are actually going green on the S&P 500 while Nvidia is red is really proving to me I mean we saw a little bit of this yesterday but I think today is kind of doubling down on this idea that we are getting a rotation. That rotation is very healthy and normal and it is good to see other parts of the market begin to participate.</p>
</details>

### 数据中心板块的震荡与甲骨文的债务影响

话虽如此，今天确实有一些股票受到了冲击。Meta 股价跌至609美元，显然遭受重创，下跌了2.82%。所有的数据中心概念股都受到了打击，比如 CoreWeave 等等。我在93.90美元的价格买入了一点 Nebius。买得不多，但买了一点。我还在19.80美元左右买了一点 Zeta。仓位不大，我明天会发布一份单页报告，说明我的想法。但只是一点点 Zeta，这更像是一个投资组合中的追踪仓位，我会在看到的情况上做更多研究。但 Nebius 是在93.90美元的低点买入的。我认为它一度跌到了92美元左右，但没有真正跌破92美元。所以如果我们收盘价高于94美元，我认为这将非常看涨，那也是我们需要守住的技术点位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that you do have some stocks that are getting hit today. Meta 609 obviously getting wrecked 2.82%. All the data center plays are getting hit. Correas etc. I did buy a little bit of Nebius at 93.90. 93.90. Did not buy a ton, but I bought a little. I also bought a little bit of Zeta at around 19.80. It's not a big position. I'll put out the one pager tomorrow on how I'm thinking about it. Uh, but very little bit a little bit of Zeta and that's just kind of like a tracking position the portfolio and I'll do a lot more research on terms of what I'm seeing there. But Nebius was the dip by at 93.90. I think we got all the way down to like 92 at one point. didn't really violate 92 and so if we close above 94 I think that would be very bullish again that's the technical spot where we need to hold.</p>
</details>

但为什么 Nebius、CoreWeave 和 Iren 会下跌呢？在我看来，所有这些股票下跌的原因是甲骨文（Oracle），它今天受到了冲击，下跌了4%。这是数据中心概念股中表现最差的，尽管它不完全是数据中心股，更偏向于云计算。原因是他们发行了400亿美元的债务，而市场不喜欢这种债务融资方式，这可能也是 Meta 受到冲击的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but why is Neb's down why is core reef down why is Iren down the reason all these names are down is because of in my opinion Oracle which is getting hit right now down 4% on the day this is the worst of the data center plays even though it's not necessarily just the data center play it's more of a cloud computing play but because they issued $40 billion of debt and the street's not liking the debt financing that's probably why Meta's getting hit as well.</p>
</details>

我查看了 Meta 债务的一些细节，条款非常有吸引力，这也解释了为什么它的债务融资条款会如此诱人——因为它是 Meta，和谷歌一样，拥有世界上所有的资本来获得有利的条款。但甲骨文没有。所以我认为，我们今天在这些数据中心股票中看到的下跌，是的，很烦人，是的，很糟糕，但对我来说，这可能也是这次牛市轮动中的正常现象。人们卖掉 Nebius、CoreWeave、Iren 和 Cipher，转而买入摩根大通或礼来。所以我不认为这是世界上最疯狂的事情，但它确实正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I was looking at some of Meta's details on the debt and It's very attractive and it makes sense why it would be attractive in terms of debt financing terms because it's freaking meta and they have all the capital in the world along with Google to be able to get attractive terms but Oracle does not and so I think the draw down we're seeing today in these data center plays which yes is annoying and yes it sucks it also to me is probably part for the core when it comes to the rotation of this bull market people selling off a nebius a core and I ran a cipher and going into a JP Morgan or an Eli Liy so I don't think it's the craziest thing in the world but nonetheless that is happening.</p>
</details>

有人说这是“健康的深呼吸”。是的，我们在这个市场中看到了更多的广度而非深度。坦率地说，在过去的九个月里，我们在科技领域看到了很多深度。现在是时候增加一些广度了。我认为这就是我们今天所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">broel says healthy deep breath. Yes, we are getting a lot more breath versus depth in this market. And quite frankly, for the past nine months, we've had a lot of depth when it comes to tech. It's time to get a little bit more breath. And I think that's what we're seeing here today.</p>
</details>

### 白宫暂停发布数据引发市场担忧

然而，有一件事对市场的广度或深度都没有帮助，那就是数据的缺乏。这是白宫今天就十月份数据将如何处理发表的声明：政府关门可能导致第四季度经济增长减少整整两个百分点。民主党的政府关门使得经济学家、投资者和美联储的政策制定者极难获得关键的政府数据。民主党人可能已经永久性地损害了联邦统计系统，十月份的CPI和就业报告可能永远不会发布。所有发布的经济数据都将受到永久性损害，使我们的美联储决策者在一个关键时期处于“盲飞”状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one of the things that's not going to help the breath or depth of this market is a lack of data. Here is what the White House had to say today about what's going to happen with this October data. shutdown could end up decreasing fourth quarter economic growth by two whole percentage points. The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economics uh economists, investors, and policy makers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data. The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released. And all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policy makers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period.</p>
</details>

不过，这并没有影响到 Open Door。顺便说一下，Open Door 之所以大涨，是因为 CAS 公司以8美元的价格购买了100万股股票。这已经正式披露，我认为这是推动 Open Door 上涨的原因。Open Door 当天上涨了10%。顺便提一下，Oklo 也上涨了8%。所以，我谈论市场的广度，你会看到像 Meta 和 Palantir 这样的股票在下跌，而像 Oklo 和 Open Door 这样的股票却在上涨。这对我来说不一定很理性，但这就是我们市场目前的状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, that's not hurting Open Door. The reason Open Door is pumping, by the way, is because CAS just bought a million of stock at $8. That was officially disclosed and I think that's what's helping Open Door. Open door up 10% on the day. By the way, Oaklow also up 8%. So, you know, I'm talking about the uh breadth of the market and you got names like Meta and Pounder that are down on the day and then you have names like Oaklow and Open that are up on the day. Doesn't necessarily scream rational to me, but nonetheless, that is the state of what we have in this market.</p>
</details>

这对政府数据意味着什么？我认为十月份的数据相当糟糕。如果数据非常亮眼，比如我们增加了几十万个工作岗位之类的，白宫是不会出来说十月份的数据永远不会发布的。市场可能会希望看到这些数据，白宫也不会害怕展示这些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh what does it mean for the government data? By the way, Bitcoin right here below 102. Uh I I think the October data is pretty bad, guys. I I you would not have the White House come out and say that the October data will never be released if the data was amazing. if we were adding, you know, hundreds of thousands of jobs or something like that, uh, the market probably would want to see that data and the White House would not be afraid to show that data.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，我早上给你们看了 ADP 的私人就业数据，他们的新估计显示，十月份每周减少了11250个工作岗位。这将是-45000个，是自2020年以来的第二大降幅。高盛估计，十月份我们将减少约50000个工作岗位。所以很明显，劳动力市场数据看起来不太好。这是支持降息的看涨理由，但白宫不想发布它，可能表明数据确实不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, I think I showed you guys this stat in the morning, but uh, private payrolls from the ADP came out and said that their new estimates are showing a decrease of 11,250 jobs per week in the month of October. That would be -45,000, the second largest drop since 2020. Goldman Sachs estimated that we would fall about 50,000 in the month of October. So obviously the labor market data is not looking the best. That is your bull case for the rate cut, but the White House not wanting to release it probably shows that it's not the best.</p>
</details>

这也让你质疑进入十一月的数据的可信度。当然，也许我们没有很好地追踪CPI和失业救济申请，所以我们需要再花一个月的时间来完成。但如果我们在十一月得不到最准确的数据，这对市场来说只是另一个需要应对的障碍，尤其是当市场已经对一些公司债务融资感到不安，他们可能希望有更多数据来理解情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It also questions or makes you question the trustworthiness of the data going into November. And granted, maybe we haven't been tracking a CPI and the jobless claims as well. And so we need another month to get it done. But if we're not going to get the most accurate data in November, it's just another kind of hiccup for the market to have to navigate, especially when, you know, the market's already feeling a little bit uneasy on some of the corporate debt financing and they might want a little more data to understand.</p>
</details>

### 个股动态与盘后财报前瞻

顺便说一句，UNH 今天表现不错。我们盘后会看看是否会收到任何超级投资者的**13F**（13F Filings: 管理超过1亿美元资产的机构投资者每季度必须向美国证券交易委员会SEC提交的持仓报告）披露。今天我们收到了一些，但没什么特别的。我看了大约四五个，没有看到任何真正突出的东西。UNH 今天上涨了4%。Open Door 和 Oklo 也在上涨。然后 AMD 表现出色，曾达到263美元，现在是257美元，这很不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UNH, by the way, great day for UNH. We'll see after the bell if we get any of these super investor disclosures. We got a couple today. Nothing too crazy. I went through about four or five of them and I didn't see anything that really stood out. UNH, right, they're up 4% on the day again. Open Doors up on the day. Oaklo is up on the day. And then AMD having a great day. AMD was at 263, right now at 257, which is very nice to see.</p>
</details>

纳斯达克指数（The Q's）转绿了，上涨至621。标普500指数也转绿。我不知道 Robinhood 是怎么收涨的，但它上涨了近2%。标普500现在突破了684点。然后是 Rocket Lab，它曾上涨7%，现在却下跌了1%。再次强调，市场在不同方面都表现出非常不稳定的反应，但我认为其核心的整体趋势是，你正在看到一轮轮动。而且我不认为这种轮动是糟糕的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Q's going green. Q's going green. 621, that's up. And the S&P 500 going green. I don't know how Robin Hood ended up green for the day, but Robin's up almost 2%. S&P 500 now breaking 684. And then you got Rocket Lab that was up 7% and it's down 1%. Again, very kind of wonky market uh reaction in a variety of different ways, but I think the overall trend at its core is that you're seeing a rotation. And I don't think that rotation is horrible.</p>
</details>

SoFi 股价32美元。我不认为 SoFi 的收盘价曾高于32美元。今天一度达到32.70美元。如果 SoFi 能收于32美元以上，那将非常不错。微软也回到了511美元。我们还有大约7分钟收盘。如果能实现这个收盘价，那就太好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, by by the way, 32. I don't think SoFi's ever closed above 32. Got to 32.70 today. Would be very nice to see if SoFi can get that close above 32. Microsoft is well back to 511. So, we got about 7 minutes left. And if we can get that closed, that would be very nice.</p>
</details>

好的，在聊天区做个投票。今天只有三只股票公布财报：DLO、Serve 和思科。我会问，你认为哪一只会表现最好？告诉我你们持有哪只股票的头寸。如果我没记错的话，DLO 更受散户青睐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, poll in the chat. So, there's only three stocks on earnings today. DLO, Serve, and um Cisco. I'll put which one do you think outperforms? Let me know which positions you guys have. DLO is more of a finit favorite or a retail favorite if I'm not wrong. Um, which one outperforms?</p>
</details>

ESB 确实有财报，但我认为除了更多关于他们以太坊持仓的披露外，我们不会从 ESB 得到任何具体信息。Serve，我见过很多次，他们为 Uber Eats 等公司制造机器人，就是那些自动为你送餐的东西。我对他们的财务状况了解不多，但你有 Serve、思科，然后是 DLO。思科显然是网络领域的巨头，尤其是在数据中心方面。哇，思科今天上涨了3%。看来市场对思科寄予厚望，我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ESB does have earnings, but I don't think we're going to get anything specific from ESB other than more disclosures of their ETH holdings. Um, Serve, I've actually seen so many times they make the robots for the the Uber Eatats and stuff, like the things that automatically or autonomously deliver you the food. uh don't know enough about their financials, but you have serve, you have Cisco, and then DLC. Cisco obviously a massive player in networking, especially with data centers. Wow, Cisco up 3% on the day. Look at that. Street's expecting a little bit of love off of Cisco, and we're going to see what that looks like.</p>
</details>

### 甲骨文的债务问题与市场担忧

顺便快速提一下，在我们讨论 Burry 之前，因为关于 Michael Burry 有一个重大更新。看看这张图。这是甲骨文的股价与甲骨文的**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swaps, CDS：一种金融衍生品，相当于为公司债务购买的保险）的对比。信用违约互换是针对其公司债务违约的保护措施。股价，如你所见，一直在下跌。所以，投资者认为，嘿，也许我们应该对甲骨文正在承担的债务更加谨慎，这与股价走势是一致的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, real quick before we talk about Bur because there's a big update on Michael Bur. Uh, take a look at this chart right here. This is Oracle stock versus Oracle credit default swaps. The credit default swap is the protection against their corporate debt defaulting the stock price, as you can obviously see, has been going down. So you have uh a level of alignment between investors thinking, hey, maybe we want to be a bit more cautioned around the debt that Oracle is taking out.</p>
</details>

他们不仅仅是说，因为甲骨文将在数据中心的所有投资资本上获得惊人的投资回报率（ROIC），所以股价会一飞冲天。我认为股价走势清楚地告诉你，并不是说甲骨文这样做是看跌的，而是市场不愿意给它一个350美元的目标价。同样，Nebius 没有到130美元，CoreWeave 没有到150美元，但它们在80-95美元的区间，而甲骨文在226美元。我只是觉得这并非世界上最疯狂的事情，特别是如果权衡的结果是礼来能够创下历史新高，而这只股票是需要参与到这轮牛市中的，很高兴看到它正在参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh versus, you know, just saying that the stock's going to go to the moon because they're going to get this amazing ROIC on all the invested capital in regards to data centers. I think that the stock price action is clearly telling you not that it's bearish that Oracle is doing this, but that the market's not willing to give it a $350 price target, which again, Nebius is not at 130, Corre's not at 150, but they're at 80 95, Oracle at 226. I just don't think that's the craziest thing in the world, especially if the the the sort of trade-off is that Eli Liy gets to make all-time highs, which is a stock that needs to participate in this bull market, and it's nice to see that it is participating.</p>
</details>

### Michael Burry 的“重大揭秘”：一个博客

Michael Burry，还记得几天前他说“等到11月25日”，因为那天应该有非常重要的事情发生吗？嗯，我30分钟前看了他的推特简介，它一直在变。现在上面写着：“Unchained 博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael Bur, remember a couple days ago when he said, "Wait for November 25th because November 25th was supposed to be something really important." Well, I just looked at his Twitter bio 30 minutes ago, which is constantly changing. And here's what it says. Now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned.</p>
</details>

所以，我猜是个博客。我猜是个博客，朋友们。现在，他是否仍然对人工智能和正在发生的一切持极度悲观的态度？当然可能。但如果这是为了宣传，我的天哪，兄弟，如果这是为了宣传。所以，现在是“Unchained 博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I guess it's a blog. I guess it's a blog, folks. I mean, now, could he still be super bearish about AI and everything that's going on? Sure. But if this was for publicity, I mean, my goodness, bro, if this was for publicity. So, now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned.</p>
</details>

我猜我们会看到这个博客最终会是什么样子。也许这个博客是一个反人工智能的博客，他每周都会发布研究报告，说明他有多讨厌人工智能。但我猜他正试图成为一名内容创作者，并试图建立个人品牌和社交媒体影响力。老兄，当我看到这个时，首先，我不是说了那可能是一本书吗？我猜错了。显然是个博客，不是书，但我感觉那就像是一本该死的书。结果是个博客。所以就是这样了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I guess we'll see what the blog ends up looking like. Maybe the blog is like an anti- AI blog and he just keeps publishing research every week about how much he hates the blog. I mean, or how much he hates AI. But I guess he's trying to become a content creator and he's trying to build a personal brand and social media. I like, dude, when I saw that, first of all, did I not say it was a book? I was off. It was a blog apparently, not a book, but I felt like it was a freaking book. And apparently it's a blog. So that's what you got.</p>
</details>

### 机构资金流入与市场情绪

我想给大家看一个宏观数据，尽管劳动力市场、通货膨胀和关税存在问题，但根据彭博社的数据，我们早上谈到，机构买家上周购买了价值43亿美元的股票，这是自2022年12月以来股票ETF的最高流入量。彭博社表示，股票ETF流入强劲。昨天有130亿美元的流入。过去五天流入了400亿美元，平均每天80亿美元。现在，美国整个ETF市场的年初至今总流入量已达1.16万亿美元。这简直是难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">quick macro stat I want to show you guys in spite of the labor market in spite of inflation in spite of tariffs as per Bloomberg. We talked about in the morning that institutional buyers bought 4.3 billion worth of equities which is the highest since December 2022 in terms of equity ETFs last week. Bloomberg said EETF inflows are strong. Yesterday there were 13 billion in inflows. 40 billion for the past five days, 8 billion per day. And now total is 1.16 trillion year to date across the entire ETF market in the United States. I mean that is just absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，我们在劳动力市场看到了一些小问题。我们缺乏数据来对当前情况做出准确的决策。但投资者继续买入，事实上，根据美国银行的数据，散户和对冲基金上周是净卖家。机构投资者是净买家，他们从科技股轮动到必需品和医疗保健股，这非常符合我们今天看到的价格走势，一些科技股下跌，而一些医疗保健和消费防御性股票上涨。所以，归根结底，虽然有很多宏观数据需要消化，但投资者仍然是净看涨的，他们正在配置那些股票ETF以获得敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so yes, we are seeing some hiccups in the labor market. We we we are seeing a lack of data to be able to make some accurate decisions on what's going on. But investors continue to buy and in fact uh retail and hedge funds were net sellers last week as of Bank of America. Institutional investors were net buyers and they rotated from tech into staples and healthcare which is very indicative of the price action we're seeing today with some of the tech stocks being down and some of the a healthcare stocks and consumer defensives being up. So again at the end of the day there is a lot of macro data to come through but you have investors that remain net bullish and they are allocating to those equity ETFs to get that exposure.</p>
</details>

### 市场收盘总结

好了，我们今天收盘了。今天是星期三，我们收盘了。我会关注盘后是否有任何13F和13G文件披露。我们显然有财报，所以我们会关注。英伟达在收盘时转绿了，报193.80美元。标普500指数报683点，以0.04%的微弱优势收涨，这显示了市场的广度在扩大，因为科技板块的一些市场参与者下跌，但标普500指数却上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, we are done for the day. We are closed on a Wednesday. I will keep an eye on if we get any 13Fs and 13Gs after the bell. We obviously have earnings, so we'll look into that. Nvidia went green at the close. 193.80 S&P 500 683. It inched out green by 0.04% which showed you a lot of that broadening trade as some market participants in the tech sector were down but the S&P 500 was up.</p>

纳斯达克指数在收盘时转红，当天微跌约50美分。Open Door 表现出色，上涨10.5%。Nebius 收盘价守住了94美元，这是一个非常关键的水平。所以我们明天要看它是否能守住，但94美元的收盘价非常不错，报94.36美元，尽管当天它下跌了7%。

SoFi 确实收在了32美元以上，报32.21美元。如果我没记错的话，这应该是 SoFi 历史上第一次收盘价高于32美元。它在一周前和今天早上都曾触及32美元，然后跌破，现在守住了32美元。所以，恭喜所有持有 SoFi 的人。

### 盘后财报速递

好的，我们有 Serve Robotics 的股价在下跌。Serve 下跌了7%。然后是思科，我马上拿到他们的数据，它上涨了一点。然后是 DLO。告诉我你们持有这些股票中的哪一只。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, we have Serve Robotics that is dumping. Serve that's down uh 7%. Then we have Cisco. I'll get their numbers in a second. That's up a little bit. And then DLO. Let me know which one of these stocks you guys are in.</p>
</details>

Serve 下跌了3%。哇，他们每股亏损54美分，而预期是亏损32美分，亏损幅度比预期大了69%。所以他们的亏损超出了预期。营收为68.7万美元，而预期为69.1万美元。他们在每股收益上未达标1%。每股收益同比下降170%，营收同比增长210%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Serve right there down 3%. Wow, they missed by 69% 54 cents versus 32 cents expected on the negative basis. So they lost more than expected. Revenue was 687,000 versus 691,000. They missed by 1% on EPS. EPS is down 170% year-over-year. Revenue is up 210% year-over-year.</p>
</details>

DLO 在下跌，下跌了5%。现在跌了8%。天哪，这只股票被打压得很惨。思科是唯一一只还算稳住的。Serve 现在下跌9%，DLO 下跌6%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is DLO pumping? DLO is dumping. Down 5%. Down 5% on DLO. That one go. Wow. Now it's down 8%. Goodness gracious. This one's getting hit. Cisco is the only one that's holding on a little bit. Serve now down 9%. DLO down 6%.</p>
</details>

哇，美联储主席柯林斯表示，额外的支持措施有拖延通胀进展的风险。认为近期进一步放宽政策的门槛相对较高。柯林斯倾向于在一段时间内保持利率稳定。老兄，如果美联储真的不打算在12月降息，这将使市场上的许多问题复杂化。我真不敢相信他们竟然说现在不是降息的时候。他们认为通胀比劳动力市场更令人担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Fed President Collins, additional support risks stalling inflation progress. See relatively high bar for further easing near-term. Fed's Collins favors holding rates steady for some time. Dude, if the Fed really is not going to cut rates in December, it complicates a lot of issues in this market. I cannot believe they're actually saying that we think it's not time to cut. They think inflation is more of a concern than the labor market right now.</p>
</details>

思科在上涨。哇，思科不常这样波动。思科是2000年代的股票，它不会那样波动。哇，思科涨了5%。它在白天已经上涨了3%。让我们看看思科的数据。思科在数据中心网络方面是一家非常重要的公司。所以他们公布非常好的数据对整体的人工智能交易很重要，即使他们不是最大的人工智能参与者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cisco is pumping. Cisco is pumping. Wow. Cisco doesn't move this often. Cisco is a stock from the 2000s. This one does not move like that. Wow. 5% on Cisco. It was already up 3% during the day. Let's see what these Cisco numbers are. And Cisco is a really important company in the context of um networking for data centers. So them putting up really good numbers matters for the overall AI trade, even if they're not like the biggest AI player.</p>
</details>

每股收益超出预期2%，为1美元，预期为98美分。营收超出预期1%，为148亿美元，预期为147亿美元。每股收益同比增长10%，营收同比增长8%。虽然不是巨大的超预期，但确实是超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Beat by 2% on EPS, a dollar versus 98 cents. Beat by 1% on revenue, one 14.8 billion versus 14.7. EPS is up 10% year-over-year. revenue is up 8% year-over-year. Not massive massive beats, but they are indeed beats.</p>
</details>

财年调整后每股收益指引为4.14美元。市场预期为4.06美元。好的，所以调整后每股收益高于预期，可能是因为利润率好于预期。利润率上升可能是由于需求旺盛或人工智能领域的效率更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fiscal year adjusted EPS $4 to 14. The street thought it was going to be $4 to 406. Okay, so adjusted EPS is higher than expected likely because margins are better than expected. margins going up is likely due to either a lot of demand or a lot more efficiency in the world of AI.</p>
</details>

我拿到 DLO 的数据了，是双双超预期。每股收益17美分，预期16美分，超出6%。营收2.82亿美元，预期2.62亿美元，超出8%。每股收益同比增长90%，营收同比增长52%。市场到底对什么不满，让它下跌了7%？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I got them. DLO, it's a double beat. It's a double beat. 17 cents versus 16 expected, that's a beat by 6%. Revenue 282 versus 262, that's a beat by 8%. EPS is up 90% year-over-year. Revenue is up 52% year-over-year. What is the street upset about to take her down 7%.</p>
</details>

数据中肯定有其他东西让市场不满意，但 DLO 下跌了，Serve Robotics 仍然下跌，而思科是上涨的。盘后还没有13F文件。我会继续关注。我们可能明天会看到大部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's got to be something else in the data street's not happy with, but you got DLO that's down. Serve Robotics is still down and Cisco is green. No 13Fs yet after the bell. I'll keep an eye on them. We might get the majority of them tomorrow, but nothing yet after the bell.</p>
</details>

### 思科与 DLocal 财报深度分析

这是一份全面超预期的财报。调整后每股收益为1美元，强于预期。营收为148.8亿美元，也强于预期。我们谈论的是第二季度的每股收益指引。请记住，我们谈论的是刚刚过去的第一季度。所以现在这是第二季度的指引。这个范围高于市场预期。第二季度营收指引也是如此。全年指引也是如此。而且这个指引更强劲，尽管有政府关门的影响。思科在联邦政府销售方面有很大的敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it's a beat across the board. So, we'll start with a dollar flat adjusted EPS earnings per share that was stronger than anticipated on revenues of 14.88 88 billion dollars. Also stronger than anticipated. We're talking about the Q2 EPS guidance. Keep in mind that this is we're talking about the past Q1. So now this is the guidance for Q2. That range is higher than what the stream anticipated. The same thing for the Q2 revenue guidance. Same thing for the fullear guidance. And this guide is stronger, much stronger despite the government shutdown. Cisco does have a lot of exposure to the federal government in terms of sales.</p>
</details>

他们在财报中引用了首席执行官 Chuck Robbins 的话，他说对他们技术的广泛需求起到了巨大作用，他们看到一个价值数十亿美元的园区更新机会开始启动，因为所有老化的网络设备都需要改造。所有这些都帮助股价上涨了3.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did say in their earnings report, there's a quote from uh Chuck uh the CEO Chuck Robbins who said that the widespread demand for their technologies playing a huge role and they're seeing a lot of a multi-billion dollar campus refresh opportunity starting to ramp up because of all the aging networking gear that needs to be revamped. So all of this helping shares go up three and a half% guys.</p>
</details>

思科表明需求充足。网络设备最终需要更换。如果你正在升级大量数据中心，那么这可能是思科的一个看涨理由，盘后上涨了4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, Cisco showing there's plenty of demand. I mean, I'll try to get some deeper numbers on what they're saying right here, but network equipment does eventually need to be replaced. And if you're upgrading a lot of these data centers, then maybe that is one of the bull cases for Cisco up 4% after hours.</p>
</details>

现在看看 DLocal 的财务数据。这家公司的数字看起来非常酷。创纪录的季度。**TPV**（Total Payment Volume: 总支付额）创下104亿美元的历史新高，同比增长60%。营收增长52%。毛利润1亿美元。他们实现了GAAP盈利。净利润同比增长93%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dude, the numbers on this, I don't know that much about this company, but the numbers on it look pretty freaking cool. Record setting quarter. TPV record high of 10.4 billion, growing 60% year-over-year. Revenues up 52%. Gross profit 100 million. They are gap profitable. Net income up 93% yearover-year.</p>
</details>

DLO 的首席执行官说：“我们又交付了一个创纪录的季度，TPV 首次超过100亿美元，毛利润超过1亿美元，这是我们强劲增长和持续多元化的又一个例子。所有这些都凸显了我们商业模式的潜力和韧性。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we delivered another record quarter, the first time with TPV above US 10 billion in gross profit that surpassed US 100 million and one more example of our strong growth and continue diversification. All of which underscore the potential and resilience of our business model, said the CEO of DLO.</p>
</details>

这看起来是一个相当不错的季度。不确定为什么股价会下跌。肯定有更深层次的原因导致股价受到冲击，但它确实下跌了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh DLO right here down 5%. I mean that looks like a pretty good quarter. Not sure why the stock is down. It's got to be something deeper for why the stock's getting hit, but that one's down. Couch likes it.</p>
</details>

有人说是因为利润率。我不知道利润率的比较情况。我会试着看看。但如果他们因为利润率而打压股价，而忽略了增长，那就意味着市场更关注效率而不是营收增长，这没问题，因为利润率一直是所有我们看到的每股收益报告的主题。但在早期阶段，如果你以52%的速度增长，你将不得不牺牲一些利润率来换取增长。Palantir 的酷之处在于他们没有为增长牺牲利润率，这是市场真正喜欢的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because of margins. Yeah. I mean, like, well, I see. I don't know what the margin comparison is. I'll try to take a look at that. But if they're going to take it down because of margins and ignore the growth, it means the street's more focused on efficiency versus topline growth, which is fine because, you know, uh, margin has been the story for all the EPS that we've seen. But in these early days, you're going to have to sacrifice some margin for growth if you are growing at, you know, 52%. The cool thing about Palunteer is they're not sacrificing margin for growth, which is what the street really likes.</p>
</details>

### 住房市场动态与政策探讨

我们之前谈到房利美（Fannie Mae）说，嘿，也许应该重新审视620的信用评分，把它降低。今天，有一些头条新闻说，我们应该有可移动的抵押贷款。所以，基本上，如果你在2020年买的房子有2.75%的抵押贷款利率，而你现在想搬家，据 Politico 报道，白宫正在探索一种方法，让你把同样的利率和同样的贷款机构带到新房子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, we were talking about Fanny saying that, hey, Fanny May saying that, hey, maybe the 620 credit score should be reook, bring that down. Today, there's some headlines saying that, well, we should have um movable mortgages. So, basically, if you have a 2.75% mortgage on your home that you bought in 2020 and you want to move, the White House is exploring a way, as for Politico, to take that same rate and the same lender you have and bring it to a new house.</p>
</details>

联邦住房管理局（Federal Housing Administration）能让这成为可能吗？是的。这对经济来说是最健康的事情吗？我不知道。那将是一种可移动的抵押贷款。你知道，这可能是白宫正在考虑的让住房更负担得起的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can the federal housing administration make that possible? Yes. Is that the healthiest thing for the economy? I don't know. That would be a moving mortgage. And you know, that could be something that the uh the White House is thinking of making housing more affordable.</p>
</details>

### 美联储鹰派言论与降息前景

这是关于美联储柯林斯的再次新闻。又一位美联储主席转向鹰派，并为我们不应该降息提出了论据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is the news on uh the Fed Collins again. Another Fed president turning into a hawk and making the argument for why we shouldn't cut.</p>
</details>

她表示，额外的货币支持有减缓或阻碍通胀回归美联储2%目标的风险。就业市场存在下行风险，但自夏季以来并未增加。她对在没有证据表明劳动力市场进一步走弱的情况下进一步放松政策持犹豫态度。她希望评估自9月份以来美联储实施的50个基点的宽松政策的效果，以确定是否谨慎行事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> She says additional monetary support risk slowing or stalling the return of inflation to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. There are downside risks to employment, she says, but they have not increased since the summer. And she's hesitant to ease further without evidence of a further weakening of the labor market. Wants to assess the effects of the easing, the 50 basis points of easing that the Fed has done since September to find out whether or not it's prudent to go ahead.</p>
</details>

重点在于，现在似乎有了一批关键官员，我不知道是否是多数，但有一批关键官员要么直接反对降息，要么建议美联储应更缓慢地行动。目前尚不清楚这是否占12名投票委员的一半，但已经很接近了。这与市场形成对比，在柯林斯发表讲话前，市场预测12月降息的概率为64%。现在是61%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The importance here, guys, it looks like there is now a critical mass of officials. I don't know if it's a a majority, but a critical mass of officials either outright opposing a rate cut or suggesting the Fed should go more slowly. It's unclear if it's half of the 12 voters that you need or six of them, but it's close. This contrast with a market that before Collins spoke moments ago when her her uh her um headlines came out, there was a 64% probability of a December rate cut. It's now 61%.</p>
</details>

老兄，如果我们得不到这次降息，哦我的天。我不认为这意味着我们会回到十月份的低点，比如标普指数640点。我只是认为，任何对年底前出现有意义上涨的希望都会被扼杀。所以，这不一定是熊市，但肯定不是牛市。这就是问题所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Dude, if we don't get this rate cut, oh my goodness. I don't think it means we like go back to the lows of October like 640 on the S&P. I just think any hope of like a meaningful run towards the end of the year gets squashed. So, it doesn't have to be bearish, but it's definitely not bullish. And that's the issue.</p>
</details>

### 投资者持仓报告（13F）初步观察

我们刚刚收到了一个。这个人管理着32亿美元。看起来他什么也没做。这是喜马拉雅资本的李录（Li Lu）。他管理着32亿美元。这家伙太牛了。谷歌、伯克希尔、美国银行、苹果和西方石油公司。然后是拼多多。显然没有买卖任何东西。

他是巴菲特的好朋友。哦，所以他持有5亿美元的伯克希尔股票。李录是喜马拉雅资本的创始人和主席。它成立于1997年。我们信奉本杰明·格雷厄姆、沃伦·巴菲特和查理·芒格的价值投资原则，如今主要关注北美的上市公司。我们的目标是通过长期持有拥有强大经济护城河、增长潜力和由值得信赖的人经营的高质量公司来实现卓越回报。我们的一些持股可以追溯到20年前。
