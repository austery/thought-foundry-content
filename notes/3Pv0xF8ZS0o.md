title: 市场轮动与数据缺失：思科财报亮眼，白宫暂停发布十月关键数据
summary: 本期市场收盘分析探讨了一个分化的市场：标普500指数收绿，而部分科技股下跌，显示出资金正从科技板块轮动至金融和医疗保健板块的健康迹象。宏观层面，白宫宣布可能永远不会发布十月份的CPI和就业报告，给美联储的决策带来了巨大的不确定性。盘后财报方面，思科（Cisco）业绩超预期，股价上涨；而DLocal（DLO）虽数据亮眼，股价却剧烈波动。此外，美联储官员的鹰派言论也为十二月的降息预期蒙上了阴影。

### 市场概览：指数上涨与个股分化

好的，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘分析。感谢各位的到来。今天是11月12日，星期三。我们即将进入盘后交易时段，有三家公司的财报值得关注：DLO、思科（Cisco）以及Serve Robotics。我们稍后会详细分析这三家公司。

今天有很多宏观数据和话题要讨论。总体来看，今天市场无疑是红色的，但这主要体现在特定股票上。**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500 Index，美国最重要的股票指数之一）实际上是上涨的，收于6833.36点。我不太确定指数上涨的确切原因，但有一些理论。像Nebius下跌7%，Corey下跌3%，Palantir下跌4%，Iren下跌4%这些可能会让投资者感到不安的个股，对标普500指数影响不大。英伟达（Nvidia）也只是勉强持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, welcome back to another episode of the market close. Thank you everybody for being here. It is Wednesday, November 12th. We are getting into the end of the close after the bell. We got three earnings: DLO, Cisco, and another one that I can't think of. Oh, Serve Robotics. So, DLO, Serve Robotics, and Cisco. Those are three companies we'll look at. Let me know if anyone has a position in any of those three companies, but we will get to those after the bell. We got some macro data, folks. We got a lot to talk about. Overall, what's going on today? It's a red day for sure, but it's a red day in specific names. The S&P 500 is green. 6833.36. We're green on the S&P. I don't know necessarily why we're green. I have some theories about it, but the individual stocks that may be upsetting people like a Nebius that's down 7% or a Corey that's down 3% or a Palantir that's down 4%, a REN down 4%, Nvidia is kind of trying to break even to be honest. It was down 2%, now it's barely down 50 cents. None of that matters to the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is green.</p>
</details>

标普500指数上涨的原因可能是金融板块的摩根大通（JP Morgan）今天受到了追捧，日内上涨了2%。同时，礼来（Eli Lilly）股价上涨2.87%，正试图冲击历史新高。我认为今天首先要指出的是，这感觉像是牛市中一次非常健康的调整。尽管Palantir目前没有一飞冲天，但看到部分资金流入礼来或摩根大通，或者只是流入消费防御性必需品板块，这并非坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason for this might be because JP Morgan is catching a bid today in the financial sector. JP Morgan up 2% on the day and Eli Lilly is trying to get to all-time highs. That's up 2.87%. I think the first thing to start off with on today is that this feels like a very, very healthy move in a bull market. Even though Palantir is not going to the moon right now, to see some of that money go into a Lily or JP Morgan or just consumer defensive staples that is not a bad thing to see.</p>
</details>

事实上，在英伟达收跌的情况下，标普500指数却能收涨，这向我证明了我们正在经历一轮市场轮动。昨天我们已经看到了一些迹象，而今天则进一步强化了这一观点。这种轮动非常健康和正常，很高兴看到市场的其他部分开始参与进来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that we are actually going green on the S&P 500 while Nvidia is red is really proving to me, I mean we saw a little bit of this yesterday but I think today is kind of doubling down on this idea that we are getting a rotation. That rotation is very healthy and normal and it is good to see other parts of the market begin to participate.</p>
</details>

### 数据中心板块承压与个人操作

话虽如此，今天确实有一些股票受到了冲击。Meta股价下跌2.82%至609美元，显然遭受重创。所有数据中心相关的股票都受到了打击，比如Correa等。我在93.90美元的价位买入了一点Nebius，虽然不多，但还是买了一些。我还在19.80美元左右买了一点Zeta，仓位不大，明天我会发布一份单页报告，阐述我的想法。这更像是一个追踪仓位，之后我会做更多研究。但今天逢低买入的主要操作是Nebius。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that you do have some stocks that are getting hit today. Meta 609 obviously getting wrecked 2.82%. All the data center plays are getting hit. Correas etc. I did buy a little bit of Nebius at 93.90. Did not buy a ton, but I bought a little. I also bought a little bit of Zeta at around 19.80. It's not a big position. I'll put out the one pager tomorrow on how I'm thinking about it. Uh, but very little bit, a little bit of Zeta and that's just kind of like a tracking position in the portfolio and I'll do a lot more research in terms of what I'm seeing there. But Nebius was the dip by at 93.90.</p>
</details>

那么，为什么Nebius、Coreweave和Iren会下跌呢？在我看来，原因在于甲骨文（Oracle），它今天下跌了4%，是数据中心概念股中表现最差的。尽管它更多的是一个云计算公司，但由于它发行了400亿美元的债务，而市场不喜欢这种债务融资方式，这可能也连带影响了Meta。我研究了Meta的债务细节，条款非常有吸引力，这很合理，因为Meta和谷歌一样，拥有世界上所有的资本来获得有利的融资条件。但甲骨文没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But why is Nebius down, why is Coreweave down, why is Iren down? The reason all these names are down is because of, in my opinion, Oracle, which is getting hit right now, down 4% on the day. This is the worst of the data center plays, even though it's not necessarily just a data center play, it's more of a cloud computing play. But because they issued $40 billion of debt and the street's not liking the debt financing, that's probably why Meta's getting hit as well. Now I was looking at some of Meta's details on the debt and It's very attractive and it makes sense why it would be attractive in terms of debt financing terms because it's freaking Meta and they have all the capital in the world along with Google to be able to get attractive terms but Oracle does not.</p>
</details>

因此，我认为今天数据中心股票的下跌，虽然令人烦恼，但也可能是这次牛市轮动中的正常现象。人们卖出Nebius、Coreweave、Iren和Cipher，转而买入摩根大通或礼来。所以我认为这并非什么疯狂的事情。市场正在获得更多的广度（breath）而非仅仅是深度（depth）。坦白说，过去九个月，我们在科技股上看到了很多深度，现在是时候增加一些广度了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think the draw down we're seeing today in these data center plays which yes is annoying and yes it sucks, it also to me is probably par for the course when it comes to the rotation of this bull market. People selling off a Nebius, a Core, and Iren, a Cipher and going into a JP Morgan or an Eli Lilly. So I don't think it's the craziest thing in the world, but nonetheless that is happening. Broel says healthy deep breath. Yes, we are getting a lot more breadth versus depth in this market. And quite frankly, for the past nine months, we've had a lot of depth when it comes to tech. It's time to get a little bit more breath. And I think that's what we're seeing here today.</p>
</details>

### 宏观不确定性：白宫暂停发布十月关键数据

然而，有一件事对市场的广度或深度都没有帮助，那就是数据的缺乏。白宫今天就十月份的数据发布发表了声明。他们表示，政府关门可能导致第四季度经济增长下降整整两个百分点。民主党造成的政府关门使得经济学家、投资者和美联储的政策制定者极难获得关键的政府数据。民主党可能已经永久性地损害了联邦统计系统，十月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index，消费者价格指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）和就业报告可能永远不会发布。所有发布的经济数据都将受到永久性损害，使我们的美联储决策者在关键时期如同盲人摸象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one of the things that's not going to help the breadth or depth of this market is a lack of data. Here is what the White House had to say today about what's going to happen with this October data. Shutdown could end up decreasing fourth quarter economic growth by two whole percentage points. The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economists, investors, and policy makers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data. The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released. And all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policy makers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period.</p>
</details>

我认为十月份的数据非常糟糕。如果数据非常亮眼，比如我们增加了数十万个工作岗位，白宫是不会站出来说这些数据永远不会发布的。市场可能希望看到这些数据，白宫也不会害怕展示它们。顺便说一下，ADP的私营部门就业报告显示，他们的新估计是十月份每周减少11,250个工作岗位，这意味着整个月减少了45,000个，是自2020年以来的第二大降幅。高盛（Goldman Sachs）估计十月份将减少约50,000个工作岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the October data is pretty bad, guys. You would not have the White House come out and say that the October data will never be released if the data was amazing. If we were adding, you know, hundreds of thousands of jobs or something like that, the market probably would want to see that data and the White House would not be afraid to show that data. By the way, I think I showed you guys this stat in the morning, but private payrolls from the ADP came out and said that their new estimates are showing a decrease of 11,250 jobs per week in the month of October. That would be -45,000, the second largest drop since 2020. Goldman Sachs estimated that we would fall about 50,000 in the month of October.</p>
</details>

显然，劳动力市场数据看起来不妙，这是支持降息的理由。但白宫不想发布数据，可能表明情况确实不佳。这也让你质疑进入十一月后数据的可信度。这只是市场需要应对的又一个障碍，尤其是在市场已经对一些企业债务融资感到不安，并可能希望获得更多数据来理解情况的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously the labor market data is not looking the best. That is your bull case for the rate cut, but the White House not wanting to release it probably shows that it's not the best. It also questions or makes you question the trustworthiness of the data going into November. And granted, maybe we haven't been tracking CPI and the jobless claims as well. And so we need another month to get it done. But if we're not going to get the most accurate data in November, it's just another kind of hiccup for the market to have to navigate, especially when, you know, the market's already feeling a little bit uneasy on some of the corporate debt financing and they might want a little more data to understand.</p>
</details>

### Michael Burry 的“十一月惊奇”原来是博客

还记得几天前迈克尔·贝瑞（Michael Burry）说“等到11月25日”吗？因为那天本应有重要的事情发生。嗯，我30分钟前看了他不断变化的推特简介，上面现在写着：“Unchained博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael Burry, remember a couple days ago when he said, "Wait for November 25th because November 25th was supposed to be something really important." Well, I just looked at his Twitter bio 30 minutes ago, which is constantly changing. And here's what it says. Now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned.</p>
</details>

所以，我猜只是一个博客。当然，他可能仍然对人工智能和当前的一切都极度看空。但如果这只是为了宣传，天哪，如果这只是为了宣传……所以，现在是“Unchained博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”我猜他想成为一名内容创作者，建立个人品牌和社交媒体影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I guess it's a blog. I guess it's a blog. I mean, now, could he still be super bearish about AI and everything that's going on? Sure. But if this was for publicity, I mean, my goodness, bro, if this was for publicity. So, now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned. I guess he's trying to become a content creator and he's trying to build a personal brand and social media.</p>
</details>

### 资金流向揭示机构投资者信心

尽管劳动力市场出现了一些问题，通货膨胀和关税也存在，但根据彭博社的数据，上周机构买家购买了价值43亿美元的股票，这是自2022年12月以来股票ETF的最高流入量。彭博社称ETF资金流入强劲。昨天有130亿美元流入，过去五天总计400亿美元，即每天80亿美元。现在，美国整个ETF市场的年初至今总流入量已达1.16万亿美元。这绝对是令人难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Quick macro stat I want to show you guys in spite of the labor market in spite of inflation in spite of tariffs as per Bloomberg. We talked about in the morning that institutional buyers bought 4.3 billion worth of equities which is the highest since December 2022 in terms of equity ETFs last week. Bloomberg said ETF inflows are strong. Yesterday there were 13 billion in inflows. 40 billion for the past five days, 8 billion per day. And now total is 1.16 trillion year to date across the entire ETF market in the United States. I mean that is just absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，我们在劳动力市场看到了一些问题，也缺乏数据来做出准确决策。但投资者仍在继续买入。事实上，根据美国银行的数据，上周散户和对冲基金是净卖出方，而机构投资者是净买入方，他们从科技股轮动到必需品和医疗保健股，这与我们今天看到的价格走势非常吻合。归根结底，尽管有很多宏观数据需要消化，但投资者仍然保持净看涨，并通过配置股票ETF来获得敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so yes, we are seeing some hiccups in the labor market. We are seeing a lack of data to be able to make some accurate decisions on what's going on. But investors continue to buy and in fact retail and hedge funds were net sellers last week as of Bank of America. Institutional investors were net buyers and they rotated from tech into staples and healthcare which is very indicative of the price action we're seeing today with some of the tech stocks being down and some of the healthcare stocks and consumer defensives being up. So again at the end of the day there is a lot of macro data to come through but you have investors that remain net bullish and they are allocating to those equity ETFs to get that exposure.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报速递：思科、DLocal 与 Serve Robotics

今天盘后有三家公司发布财报：DLO、Serve和思科。

思科的表现非常亮眼。这是一家通常波动不大的公司，但盘后上涨了5%。在数据中心网络领域，思科是一家非常重要的公司，所以他们出色的业绩对整体人工智能交易至关重要。**EPS**（Earnings Per Share，每股收益）超出预期2%，为1美元；营收超出预期1%，为148亿美元。EPS同比增长10%，营收同比增长8%。虽然不是巨大的超越，但确实是超越了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cisco is pumping. Wow. Cisco doesn't move this often. Cisco is a stock from the 2000s. This one does not move like that. Wow. 5% on Cisco. It was already up 3% during the day. Let's see what these Cisco numbers are. And Cisco is a really important company in the context of networking for data centers. So them putting up really good numbers matters for the overall AI trade, even if they're not like the biggest AI player. Beat by 2% on EPS, a dollar versus 98 cents. Beat by 1% on revenue, 14.8 billion versus 14.7. EPS is up 10% year-over-year. Revenue is up 8% year-over-year. Not massive massive beats, but they are indeed beats.</p>
</details>

他们的指引也非常强劲，调整后EPS和营收指引均高于市场预期，尽管面临政府关门的影响。公司首席执行官查克·罗宾斯（Chuck Robbins）表示，对其技术的广泛需求起到了巨大作用，而且由于所有老化的网络设备需要更新，他们看到了一个价值数十亿美元的园区更新机会正在启动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this guide is stronger, much stronger despite the government shutdown. Cisco does have a lot of exposure to the federal government in terms of sales. They did say in their earnings report, there's a quote from the CEO Chuck Robbins who said that the widespread demand for their technologies playing a huge role and they're seeing a lot of a multi-billion dollar campus refresh opportunity starting to ramp up because of all the aging networking gear that needs to be revamped. So all of this helping shares go up three and a half percent guys.</p>
</details>

接下来是DLO（DLocal），它也实现了双重超预期。EPS为17美分，高于预期的16美分；营收为2.82亿美元，高于预期的2.62亿美元。EPS同比增长90%，营收同比增长52%。但市场似乎对某些数据不满意，导致股价下跌了7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">DLO, it's a double beat. 17 cents versus 16 expected, that's a beat by 6%. Revenue 282 versus 262, that's a beat by 8%. EPS is up 90% year-over-year. Revenue is up 52% year-over-year. What is the street upset about to take her down 7%. It's got to be something else in the data street's not happy with, but you got DLO that's down.</p>
</details>

DLO的业绩看起来非常不错。这是一个创纪录的季度，**TPV**（Total Payment Volume，总支付额）首次超过104亿美元，同比增长60%；营收增长52%；毛利润达到1亿美元。他们实现了GAAP盈利，净利润同比增长93%。尽管如此，股价还是下跌了，可能是因为利润率问题。市场似乎更关注效率而非营收增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dude, the numbers on this, I don't know that much about this company, but the numbers on it look pretty freaking cool. Record setting quarter. TPV record high of 10.4 billion, growing 60% year-over-year. Revenues up 52%. Gross profit 100 million. They are gap profitable. Net income up 93% year-over-year. I mean that looks like a pretty good quarter. Not sure why the stock is down. It's got to be something deeper for why the stock's getting hit, but that one's down. because of margins. Yeah. I mean, like, well, I see. I don't know what the margin comparison is. But if they're going to take it down because of margins and ignore the growth, it means the street's more focused on efficiency versus topline growth.</p>
</details>

最后是Serve Robotics，他们亏损超过预期，营收也略低于预期。尽管营收同比增长了210%，但EPS同比下降了170%。股价盘后下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Serve right there down 3%. Wow, they missed by 69% 54 cents versus 32 cents expected on the negative basis. So they lost more than expected. Revenue was 687,000 versus 691,000. They missed by 1% on EPS. EPS is down 170% year-over-year. Revenue is up 210% year-over-year.</p>
</details>

### 美联储鹰派声音再起，十二月降息预期动摇

美联储主席柯林斯（Collins）的言论给市场带来了更多复杂性。她表示，进一步的货币支持有拖延通胀回归目标的风险，并认为在进一步放宽政策前有较高的门槛。她倾向于将利率稳定一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fed President Collins, additional support risks stalling inflation progress. See relatively high bar for further easing near-term. Fed's Collins favors holding rates steady for some time. Dude, if the Fed really is not going to cut rates in December, it complicates a lot of issues in this market. I cannot believe they're actually saying that we think it's not time to cut. They think inflation is more of a concern than the labor market right now.</p>
</details>

这表明，越来越多的美联储官员要么直接反对降息，要么建议放慢步伐。这与市场预期形成了对比，在柯林斯讲话前，市场预测12月降息的概率为64%，讲话后降至61%。如果美联储真的不在12月降息，虽然不一定会导致市场暴跌，但肯定会扼杀年底前出现有意义反弹的希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It looks like there is now a critical mass of officials. I don't know if it's a majority, but a critical mass of officials either outright opposing a rate cut or suggesting the Fed should go more slowly. This contrast with a market that before Collins spoke moments ago when her headlines came out, there was a 64% probability of a December rate cut. It's now 61%. Dude, if we don't get this rate cut, oh my goodness. I don't think it means we go back to the lows of October like 640 on the S&P. I just think any hope of like a meaningful run towards the end of the year gets squashed. So, it doesn't have to be bearish, but it's definitely not bullish. And that's the issue.</p>
</details>

### 其他市场动态与13F文件观察

在住房方面，上周抵押贷款需求有所回升。尽管我们正进入房地产市场的淡季，但购房者似乎仍在努力，可能是因为市场供应增加和价格软化。白宫正在探讨一种“可移动抵押贷款”的可能性，即允许房主在搬家时将现有的低利率抵押贷款转移到新房子上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some movement on the housing front with demand for mortgages ticking up last week. Mortgage applications to buy a home rose 6% last week to their strongest pace since September. Today, there's some headlines saying that, well, we should have movable mortgages. So, basically, if you have a 2.75% mortgage on your home that you bought in 2020 and you want to move, the White House is exploring a way, as for Politico, to take that same rate and the same lender you have and bring it to a new house.</p>
</details>

关于**13F**（ institutional investment managers with over $100 million in AUM must file quarterly reports，管理超过1亿美元资产的机构投资经理必须提交的季度报告）文件，今天还没有太多重磅消息。我们看到了一些小型基金的持仓变动，比如一些基金减持了甲骨文和Meta，增持了谷歌。但像阿克曼（Ackman）、巴菲特（Buffett）等超级投资者的文件尚未公布，预计明天会有更多披露。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those are most of the 13Fs. We're not getting Ackman, Tepper, Buffett, none of those yet. It might come out tomorrow. If we do get them, we'll talk about it, but so far not yet.</p>
</details>

最后，关于特朗普（Trump）对爱泼斯坦（Epstein）事件泄露邮件的评论，他在Truth Social上称其为“民主党的骗局”，意在转移公众对政府关门等失败政策的注意力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Epstein stuff. So, we talked about it in the morning. Some leaked emails came out. Trump has commented on it on Truth Social and well, he said it's a uh it's it's a Democratic hoax. So basically he came out and said that the Democrats are trying to ignore the shutdown and convince the American people that the Epstein thing matters more.</p>
</details>

总而言之，今天市场收盘时标普500指数收绿，报683.38点。明天我们将迎来更多13F文件的披露以及更多财报，同时可能还会有一些宏观数据发布，这些都将是市场关注的焦点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it for me. Thank you everybody. Appreciate it. We'll be back tomorrow. S&P 500 ended green for the day 683.38. Tomorrow we'll get a lot more of those 13F, 13Gs disclosures and we'll see what exposure based on the disclosure these companies have or these investors have to some of the more important stocks in the market. We also might get some macro data. I mean, the White House is saying we're not going to get CPI and jobs data, but you might get some parts of data tomorrow. And so that stuff will be important as well.</p>
