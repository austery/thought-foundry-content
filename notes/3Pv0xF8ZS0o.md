title: 市场深度解读：白宫暂停发布十月数据，思科财报超预期与市场轮动
---

### 市场概览：指数上涨与个股分化

欢迎回到新一期的“收盘市场”节目。感谢各位的参与。今天是11月12日，星期三。我们即将进入盘后交易时段，有三家公司将公布财报：DLO、思科（Cisco）和 Serve Robotics。我们将会关注这三家公司。如果有人持有这三家公司中任何一家的头寸，请告诉我，我们将在盘后讨论它们。

朋友们，我们有一些宏观数据要谈，有很多内容需要讨论。总的来说，今天市场表现如何？虽然肯定是下跌的一天，但下跌主要集中在特定的股票上。**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500 Index: 标准普尔500指数，代表美国500家大型上市公司的股票指数）实际上是上涨的，收于6833.6点。

<p class="english-text">All right, welcome back to another episode of the market close. Thank you everybody for being here. It is Wednesday, November 12th. We are getting into the end of the close after the bell. We got three earnings: DLO, Cisco, and another one that I can't think of. Oh, Serve Robotics. So, DLO, Serve Robotics, and Cisco. Those are three companies we'll look at. Let me know if anyone has a position in any of those three companies, but we will get to those after the bell.</p>
<p class="english-text">We got some macro data, folks. We got a lot to talk about. Overall, what's going on today? It's a red day for sure, but it's a red day in specific names. The S&P 500 is green. 6833.6.</p>
</details>

我们看到标普500指数收绿。我不确定具体原因，但我有一些理论。然而，那些可能让人们感到不安的个股，比如 Nebus 下跌7%，Corey 下跌3%，Palantir 下跌4%，REN 下跌4%，而英伟达（Nvidia）则在努力实现盈亏平衡。它曾下跌2%，现在仅下跌50美分。所有这些对标普500指数都无关紧要，因为它依然是上涨的。

这背后的原因可能是摩根大通（JP Morgan）今天在金融板块受到追捧，日内上涨了2%。同时，礼来（Eli Lilly）正试图冲击历史新高，上涨了2.87%。我认为今天首先要指出的是，这感觉像是牛市中一次非常健康的回调。尽管 Palantir 目前没有一飞冲天，但看到部分资金流入礼来或摩根大通，或者仅仅是流入消费防御性必需品板块，这并非坏事。

事实上，在英伟达下跌的情况下，标普500指数竟然能够收绿，这向我证明了我们正在经历市场轮动。昨天我们已经看到了一些迹象，而今天则进一步强化了这一观点。这种轮动非常健康和正常，很高兴看到市场的其他部分开始参与进来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We're green on the S&P. I don't know necessarily why we're green. I have some theories about it, but the individual stocks that may be upsetting people like a Nebus that's down 7% or a Corey that's down 3% or a Palantir that's down 4%, a REN down 4%, Nvidia is kind of trying to break even to be honest. It was down 2%, now it's barely down 50 cents. None of that matters to the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is green.</p>
<p class="english-text">The reason for this might be because JP Morgan is catching a bid today in the financial sector. JP Morgan up 2% on the day and Eli Lilly is trying to get to all-time highs. That's up 2.87%. I think the first thing to start off with on today is that this feels like a very very healthy move in a bull market. Even though Palantir is not going to the moon right now, to see some of that money go into a Lily or JP Morgan or just consumer defensive staples that is not a bad thing to see.</p>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that we are actually going green on the S&P 500 while Nvidia is red is really proving to me, I mean we saw a little bit of this yesterday, but I think today is kind of doubling down on this idea that we are getting a rotation. That rotation is very healthy and normal and it is good to see other parts of the market begin to participate.</p>

### 数据中心板块承压与甲骨文发债影响

话虽如此，今天确实有一些股票受到了冲击。Meta 股价跌至609美元，重挫2.82%。所有数据中心相关的股票都受到了打击，比如 Coreweave 等。我在93.90美元的价格买入了一点 Nebius，虽然不多，但还是买了一些。我还在19.80美元左右买入了一点 Zeta，仓位不大。我明天会发布一份单页报告，阐述我的想法。Zeta 只是一个追踪仓位，我会对其进行更多研究。但今天逢低买入的是 Nebius，价格在93.90美元。我认为它一度跌至92美元左右，但并未真正跌破92美元。因此，如果我们能收于94美元以上，我认为这将非常看涨。从技术角度看，这是我们需要守住的位置。

但为什么 Nebius、Coreweave 和 Iren 都在下跌呢？在我看来，这些股票下跌的原因是甲骨文（Oracle），它目前正受重创，日内下跌4%。这是数据中心概念股中表现最差的，尽管它不完全是数据中心股，更偏向于云计算。原因是他们发行了400亿美元的债券，而市场不喜欢这种债务融资方式。这可能也是 Meta 受挫的原因。

我研究了 Meta 的一些债务细节，发现其条款非常有吸引力，这也很合理，因为它是 Meta，和谷歌一样拥有全世界的资本，能够获得有利的融资条件。但甲骨
文不具备这种优势。因此，我认为今天数据中心概念股的下跌，虽然令人烦恼，但也可能是这次牛市轮动中的正常现象。投资者卖出 Nebius、Coreweave、Iren 和 Cipher，转而买入摩根大通或礼来。所以我不认为这是什么惊天动地的大事，但它确实正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that you do have some stocks that are getting hit today. Meta at 609 obviously getting wrecked 2.82%. All the data center plays are getting hit. Coreweave etc. I did buy a little bit of Nebius at 93.90. Did not buy a ton, but I bought a little. I also bought a little bit of Zeta at around 19.80. It's not a big position. I'll put out the one pager tomorrow on how I'm thinking about it. But very little bit a little bit of Zeta and that's just kind of like a tracking position in the portfolio and I'll do a lot more research in terms of what I'm seeing there. But Nebius was the dip buy at 93.90. I think we got all the way down to like 92 at one point, didn't really violate 92 and so if we close above 94 I think that would be very bullish again that's the technical spot where we need to hold.</p>
<p class="english-text">But why is Nebius down, why is Coreweave down, why is Iren down? The reason all these names are down is because of, in my opinion, Oracle which is getting hit right now, down 4% on the day. This is the worst of the data center plays even though it's not necessarily just a data center play, it's more of a cloud computing play. But because they issued $40 billion of debt and the street's not liking the debt financing, that's probably why Meta's getting hit as well.</p>
<p class="english-text">Now I was looking at some of Meta's details on the debt and It's very attractive and it makes sense why it would be attractive in terms of debt financing terms because it's freaking Meta and they have all the capital in the world along with Google to be able to get attractive terms. But Oracle does not and so I think the draw down we're seeing today in these data center plays which yes is annoying and yes it sucks, it also to me is probably part for the course when it comes to the rotation of this bull market. People selling off a Nebius, a Coreweave, an Iren, a Cipher and going into a JP Morgan or an Eli Lilly. So I don't think it's the craziest thing in the world but nonetheless that is happening.</p>
</details>

有评论说这是“健康的深呼吸”。是的，我们正在这个市场中看到更多的广度而非深度。坦率地说，过去九个月，我们在科技领域看到了很多深度。现在是时候增加一些广度了，我认为今天我们看到的就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Broel says healthy deep breath. Yes, we are getting a lot more breadth versus depth in this market. And quite frankly, for the past nine months, we've had a lot of depth when it comes to tech. It's time to get a little bit more breadth. And I think that's what we're seeing here today.</p>
</details>

### 宏观风云：白宫暂停发布十月关键数据

然而，有一件事对市场的广度或深度都没有帮助，那就是数据的缺乏。以下是白宫今天就十月份数据将如何处理的表态：政府停摆可能导致第四季度经济增长减少整整两个百分点。民主党的停摆使得经济学家、投资者和美联储的政策制定者极难获得关键的政府数据。民主党可能已经永久性地损害了联邦统计系统，十月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）和就业报告可能永远不会发布。所有发布的经济数据都将受到永久性损害，使我们的美联储决策者在一个关键时期处于“盲飞”状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one of the things that's not going to help the breadth or depth of this market is a lack of data. Here is what the White House had to say today about what's going to happen with this October data. The shutdown could end up decreasing fourth quarter economic growth by two whole percentage points. The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economists, investors, and policy makers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data. The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released. And all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policy makers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period.</p>
</details>

不过，这并未影响到 OpenDoor。顺便说一下，OpenDoor 之所以大涨，是因为 CAS 公司以8美元的价格购买了100万股股票，这已经正式披露，我认为这是推动 OpenDoor 上涨的原因。OpenDoor 当天上涨了10%。另外，Oaklo 也上涨了8%。所以，我谈论市场广度的时候，你会看到像 Meta 和 Palantir 这样的股票在下跌，而像 Oaklo 和 OpenDoor 这样的股票却在上涨。这对我来说不一定理性，但这就是当前市场的状况。

关于政府数据，这意味着什么？顺便提一下，比特币目前低于102,000美元。我认为十月份的数据相当糟糕。如果数据非常好，比如我们新增了几十万个就业岗位，白宫就不会出来说十月份的数据将永远不会发布。市场可能会希望看到这些数据，白宫也不会害怕公布。

顺便说一下，我早上给你们看了 ADP 的私营部门就业数据，他们的新估计显示，十月份每周减少11,250个工作岗位。这将导致月度减少45,000个，是自2020年以来的第二大降幅。高盛（Goldman Sachs）估计，十月份我们将减少约50,000个工作岗位。所以很明显，劳动力市场数据看起来不太好。这是支持降息的看涨理由，但白宫不想发布数据，可能表明情况不佳。

这也让你质疑进入十一月份数据的可信度。当然，也许我们没有很好地追踪CPI和失业救济申请数据，所以需要再花一个月的时间来完成。但如果我们在十一月份得不到最准确的数据，这对市场来说又是一个需要应对的障碍，尤其是在市场已经对一些企业债务融资感到不安，可能希望有更多数据来理解情况的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that's not hurting Open Door. The reason Open Door is pumping, by the way, is because CAS just bought a million of stock at $8. That was officially disclosed and I think that's what's helping Open Door. Open door up 10% on the day. By the way, Oaklo also up 8%. So, you know, I'm talking about the breadth of the market and you got names like Meta and Palantir that are down on the day and then you have names like Oaklo and Open that are up on the day. Doesn't necessarily scream rational to me, but nonetheless, that is the state of what we have in this market.</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh what does it mean for the government data? By the way, Bitcoin right here below 102. I think the October data is pretty bad, guys. You would not have the White House come out and say that the October data will never be released if the data was amazing. if we were adding, you know, hundreds of thousands of jobs or something like that, the market probably would want to see that data and the White House would not be afraid to show that data.</p>
<p class="english-text">By the way, I think I showed you guys this stat in the morning, but private payrolls from the ADP came out and said that their new estimates are showing a decrease of 11,250 jobs per week in the month of October. That would be -45,000, the second largest drop since 2020. Goldman Sachs estimated that we would fall about 50,000 in the month of October. So obviously the labor market data is not looking the best. That is your bull case for the rate cut, but the White House not wanting to release it probably shows that it's not the best.</p>
<p class="english-text">It also questions or makes you question the trustworthiness of the data going into November. And granted, maybe we haven't been tracking CPI and the jobless claims as well. And so we need another month to get it done. But if we're not going to get the most accurate data in November, it's just another kind of hiccup for the market to have to navigate, especially when, you know, the market's already feeling a little bit uneasy on some of the corporate debt financing and they might want a little more data to understand.</p>
</details>

今天 UNH 表现出色。盘后我们会看看是否会有超级投资者的持仓披露。今天有几个，但没什么特别的。我看了四五个，没发现什么引人注目的。UNH 当天上涨了4%。OpenDoor 和 Oaklo 也都上涨了。AMD 表现也很棒，从263美元涨到了现在的257美元，非常不错。纳斯达克100指数（Q's）和标普500指数都转绿了。我不知道 Robinhood 是怎么收绿的，但它上涨了近2%。标普500现在突破了684点。然后是 Rocket Lab，它曾上涨7%，现在却下跌了1%。市场反应确实有些古怪，但核心趋势是轮动，而且我不认为这种轮动是坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UNH, by the way, great day for UNH. We'll see after the bell if we get any of these super investor disclosures. We got a couple today. Nothing too crazy. I went through about four or five of them and I didn't see anything that really stood out. UNH, right, they're up 4% on the day again. Open Door is up on the day. Oaklo is up on the day. And then AMD having a great day. AMD was at 263, right now at 257, which is very nice to see. The Q's going green. 621, that's up. And the S&P 500 going green. I don't know how Robin Hood ended up green for the day, but Robin's up almost 2%. S&P 500 now breaking 684. And then you got Rocket Lab that was up 7% and it's down 1%. Again, very kind of wonky market reaction in a variety of different ways, but I think the overall trend at its core is that you're seeing a rotation. And I don't think that rotation is horrible.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，SoFi 股价达到了32美元。我不认为 SoFi 曾收于32美元以上。今天最高达到了32.70美元。如果 SoFi 能收在32美元以上，那就太好了。微软也回到了511美元。我们还有大约7分钟收盘，如果能实现这个收盘价，将非常不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, by the way, 32. I don't think SoFi's ever closed above 32. Got to 32.70 today. Would be very nice to see if SoFi can get that close above 32. Microsoft is well back to 511. So, we got about 7 minutes left. And if we can get that closed, that would be very nice.</p>
</details>

好的，在聊天区做个投票。今天只有三只股票公布财报：DLO、Serve 和思科。你认为哪只会表现出色？请告诉我你们持有哪只股票。如果我没记错的话，DLO 更受散户青睐。ESB 也有财报，但除了披露更多以太坊持仓外，我预计不会有太多具体信息。

我见过 Serve 很多次，他们为 Uber Eats 等平台制造机器人，就是那些自动送餐的小车。我对他们的财务状况了解不多。思科显然是网络领域的巨头，尤其是在数据中心方面。哇，思科今天上涨了3%。市场似乎对思科寄予厚望，我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, poll in the chat. So, there's only three stocks on earnings today. DLO, Serve, and um Cisco. I'll put which one do you think outperforms? Let me know which positions you guys have. DLO is more of a retail favorite if I'm not wrong. Um, which one outperforms? DLO. ESB does have earnings, but I don't think we're going to get anything specific from ESB other than more disclosures of their ETH holdings.</p>
<p class="english-text">Um, Serve, I've actually seen so many times they make the robots for the the Uber Eats and stuff, like the things that automatically or autonomously deliver you the food. uh don't know enough about their financials, but you have serve, you have Cisco, and then DLO. Cisco obviously a massive player in networking, especially with data centers. Wow, Cisco up 3% on the day. Look at that. Street's expecting a little bit of love off of Cisco, and we're going to see what that looks like.</p>
</details>

OpenDoor 上涨9%，UNH 上涨4%，AMD 上涨8.6%，Zeta 上涨3.28%。我今天和 Ronnie 对 Zeta 进行了深入探讨，我认为他提出了一个很有说服力的论点。大家可以在我的 Twitter Spaces 上收听。我今天买入一点的主要原因是，在一个估值偏高的市场中，它的估值看起来非常有吸引力。因此，其增长预期加上估值，至少值得我建立一个初始仓位。

Nebius 股价为94.68美元。我确实在93.90美元逢低买入。收盘价高于94美元将是超级看涨的信号，看看我们是否能扭转下跌趋势。但今天 Nebius 是下跌的。PayPal 下跌0.5%，小鹏汽车（Xpeng）微跌，Grab 下跌1%，Sea Limited 微涨。以太坊价格在3400美元。

我今天没有逢低买入 Meta。Meta 看起来想跌破600美元。我不知道是否会到那个位置。事实上，Meta 已经回到了我们上周五看到的水平，虽然不完全是，上周五是600美元，现在是608美元。但在大盘上涨的情况下，Meta 却试图回到那个水平，这相当惊人。这意味着市场现在对 Meta 的叙事不感兴趣。我认为部分原因与企业债务问题有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Open door right here up 9%. UNH up 4%, AMD up 8.6, Zeta up 3.28%. I did a really good deep dive in my opinion with Ronnie. So, if anyone wants to listen to that, it's on my Twitter spaces and I think he made a pretty compelling case. So, uh, for anyone to check that out, the main reason I bought a little bit today is just because valuation looks very compelling in a market that is a bit more expensive. And so, the growth estimates on top of the valuation to me made it at least worthy of a starter position.</p>
<p class="english-text">Nebius right there 94.68. Again, I did buy the dip at 93.90. Uh, closing above 94 would be super bullish to see if we can reverse a little bit of the downtrend. But you do have a red Nebius on the day. PayPal that's down half a percent. Xpeng's down a little bit. Grab's down 1%. Sea Limited that's up a little bit. And then Ethereum right there at 3,400.</p>
<p class="english-text">I did not buy the dip on Meta today. Meta looks like it wants to go below 600. I don't know if we'll get there. The fact that Meta is back to levels that we saw on Friday, not fully, right? We on Friday we saw like 600. Right now we're at 608. But the fact that the market's up and Meta is actually trying to get back to that level is quite incredible. It means the street is just not messing with the Meta narrative right now. And again, I think part of the reason is because of what's going on with corporate debt.</p>
</details>

顺便快速看一下这张图表，这是甲骨文的股价与**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swaps: 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者转移或对冲其信用风险）的对比。CDS 是对其公司债务违约的保护。如你所见，股价一直在下跌。这表明投资者在对甲骨文发债持谨慎态度方面存在一定共识，而不是简单地认为因为他们将在数据中心投入大量资本并获得惊人的**投资资本回报率**（Return on Invested Capital: 衡量公司利用其资本创造利润效率的指标），股价就会一飞冲天。

我认为股价走势清楚地告诉你，市场并非看空甲骨文的举动，而是不愿意给它350美元的目标价。Nebius 没有到130美元，Coreweave 也没有到150美元，但它们在80-95美元的区间，而甲骨文在226美元。我不认为这有什么奇怪的，特别是如果代价是礼来（Eli Lilly）创下历史新高——这只股票需要参与到牛市中来，很高兴看到它正在参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, real quick before we talk about Burry because there's a big update on Michael Burry. Uh, take a look at this chart right here. This is Oracle stock versus Oracle credit default swaps. The credit default swap is the protection against their corporate debt defaulting. The stock price, as you can obviously see, has been going down. So you have a level of alignment between investors thinking, hey, maybe we want to be a bit more cautioned around the debt that Oracle is taking out versus, you know, just saying that the stock's going to go to the moon because they're going to get this amazing ROIC on all the invested capital in regards to data centers.</p>
<p class="english-text">I think that the stock price action is clearly telling you not that it's bearish that Oracle is doing this, but that the market's not willing to give it a $350 price target, which again, Nebius is not at 130, Coreweave's not at 150, but they're at 80-95, Oracle at 226. I just don't think that's the craziest thing in the world, especially if the trade-off is that Eli Lilly gets to make all-time highs, which is a stock that needs to participate in this bull market, and it's nice to see that it is participating.</p>
</details>

OpenDoor 当日上涨10.9%，达到9.40美元。CEO 今天购买了价值一百万美元的股票，我认为这是其上涨的原因之一。微软股价为511美元。SoFi 怎么样了？我们能收在32美元吗？SoFi 股价为32.28美元，上涨4.5%。它正在努力收于32美元。

我没有持有，但他们今天公布了财报。我没来得及看他们的数字，股价下跌了约4.8%。Cleanspark 在发行可转换票据后下跌5%。英特尔基本持平。Beyond Meat 下跌8%。亚马逊，哇，跌破245美元，现在是243.95美元，收跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Open door right there. 10.9% on the day. 9.40 again. The CEO bought a million worth of stock today. I think that's one of the reasons it's pumping. Microsoft at 511. Where is SoFi? Are we trying to go for that $32 close? SoFi 32.28 up 4.5%. It is trying to get that close at 32.</p>
<p class="english-text">I do not have but uh they did have earnings today. I really didn't get to look at their numbers. Down about 4.8%. But that stock is down. Cleanspark down 5% after their convertible note offering. Intel's basically flat. Beyond Meat down 8% on the day. And then Amazon, wow. Broke 245, 243.95 right there. And that is red.</p>

### Michael Burry的“大事件”揭晓：一个博客

记得几天前迈克尔·贝瑞（Michael Burry）说“等到11月25日”，因为那天应该有重要的事情发生吗？嗯，我30分钟前看了他的推特简介，它一直在变。现在写的是：“Unchained 博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”

所以，我想是个博客吧。有人说财报是明天，好的，那我们明天再谈。我想就是个博客，朋友们。当然，他可能仍然对人工智能和当前的一切非常看空。但如果这只是为了宣传，天哪，如果这只是为了宣传。所以，现在是“Unchained 博客将于11月25日上线。敬请期待。”

我想我们会看看这个博客到底是什么样的。也许这个博客是反人工智能的，他每周都会发布研究报告，说明他有多讨厌人工智能。但我想他正试图成为一名内容创作者，建立个人品牌和社交媒体影响力。老兄，当我看到这个时，首先，我不是说过像是一本书吗？我猜错了，显然是博客，不是书，但我感觉就像是一本书。现在看来是博客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Michael Burry, remember a couple days ago when he said, "Wait for November 25th because November 25th was supposed to be something really important." Well, I just looked at his Twitter bio 30 minutes ago, which is constantly changing. And here's what it says. Now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned.</p>
<p class="english-text">So, I guess it's a blog. On says tomorrow. Okay, cool. So, I guess it's dumping a little bit before earnings tomorrow. So, we'll cover it tomorrow. I guess it's a blog, folks. I guess it's a blog. I mean, now, could he still be super bearish about AI and everything that's going on? Sure. But if this was for publicity, I mean, my goodness, bro, if this was for publicity. So, now Unchained blog launches November 25th. Stay tuned.</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I guess we'll see what the blog ends up looking like. Maybe the blog is like an anti-AI blog and he just keeps publishing research every week about how much he hates the blog. I mean, or how much he hates AI. But I guess he's trying to become a content creator and he's trying to build a personal brand and social media. I like, dude, when I saw that, first of all, did I not say it was a book? I was off. It was a blog apparently, not a book, but I felt like it was a freaking book. And apparently it's a blog. So that's what you got.</p>

### 资金流向揭示市场轮动迹象

我们来看看贝瑞那边会发生什么。Meta 股价为608美元，日内下跌约3%。甲骨文下跌4%。SoFi 正在努力收于32美元。我们还有大约一分半钟收盘，然后将公布一些财报。

我想给大家看一个宏观数据。尽管劳动力市场、通货膨胀和关税存在问题，但根据彭博社的数据，上周机构买家购买了价值43亿美元的股票，这是自2022年12月以来股票ETF的最高流入量。彭博社称，股票ETF流入强劲。昨天有130亿美元的流入，过去五天总计400亿美元，即每天80亿美元。现在，美国整个ETF市场的年初至今总流入量已达1.16万亿美元。这绝对是惊人的。

所以，是的，我们在劳动力市场看到了一些小问题，也缺乏数据来做出准确的决策。但投资者仍在继续买入。事实上，根据美国银行的数据，上周散户和对冲基金是净卖家，而机构投资者是净买家，他们从科技股轮动到了必需品和医疗保健股。这与我们今天看到的价格走势非常吻合，一些科技股下跌，而一些医疗保健和消费防御性股票上涨。所以，归根结底，虽然有很多宏观数据需要消化，但投资者仍然保持净看涨，并将资金配置到那些股票ETF中以获得敞口。

<p class="english-text">and we're going to see what ends up happening with Burry. Meta right here 608 down about 3% on the day. Oracle down 4% so trying to get that $32 close. We got about a minute 30 until the market closes. Then we have some earnings. quick macro stat I want to show you guys in spite of the labor market in spite of inflation in spite of tariffs as per Bloomberg. We talked about in the morning that institutional buyers bought 4.3 billion worth of equities which is the highest since December 2022 in terms of equity ETFs last week. Bloomberg said ETF inflows are strong. Yesterday there were 13 billion in inflows. 40 billion for the past five days, 8 billion per day. And now total is 1.16 trillion year to date across the entire ETF market in the United States. I mean that is just absolutely incredible.</p>
<p class="english-text">And so yes, we are seeing some hiccups in the labor market. We are seeing a lack of data to be able to make some accurate decisions on what's going on. But investors continue to buy and in fact uh retail and hedge funds were net sellers last week as of Bank of America. Institutional investors were net buyers and they rotated from tech into staples and healthcare which is very indicative of the price action we're seeing today with some of the tech stocks being down and some of the healthcare stocks and consumer defensives being up. So again at the end of the day there is a lot of macro data to come through but you have investors that remain net bullish and they are allocating to those equity ETFs to get that exposure.</p>

苹果股价273美元，下跌0.5%。Coreweave 下跌3.2%。Palantir 从181美元跌至184美元，小幅下跌。英伟达刚刚转绿了，哇，在收盘前。英伟达转绿了。我们今天将关注三份财报。但很高兴看到英伟达和标普500指数在收盘前转绿。

<p class="english-text">Apple right there 273. That's down half a percent. Coreweave down 3.2. Palantir was at 181 now at 184. That's down a little bit. Nvidia just went green. Wow. Into the close. Nvidia going green again. We got three earnings that we're going to be looking at today. Um, but it is nice to see Nvidia and the S&P go green as we get into the close.</p>
</details>

感谢大家的收看。今天是11月12日，星期三，下午4点，股市现已收盘。好了，今天结束了。周三收盘。我会关注盘后是否会有任何**13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会规定，管理资产超过1亿美元的机构投资者每个季度必须提交的持仓报告）或13G报告。我们显然有财报要看。

英伟达在收盘时转绿，报193.80美元。标普500指数报683点，微涨0.04%，这显示了市场的广度，因为科技板块的一些市场参与者下跌，但标普500指数却上涨了。纳斯达克100指数在收盘时转红，曾试图转绿，日内下跌约50美分。OpenDoor 表现出色，上涨10.5%。Nebius 收于94美元，这是一个非常关键的水平，所以我们明天要看它能否守住，但94美元的收盘价非常不错，为94.36美元，尽管它当天曾下跌7%。Robinhood 转绿，报132.98美元。Oaklo 上涨6.5%。比特币略低于102,000美元。Coreweave 下跌约3.35%。Iren 下跌3%。英伟达再次报193.80美元。Grab 报5.79美元，下跌1.5%。特斯拉从440美元跌至430美元，下跌2%。Hims 跌破40美元，报39美元。达美航空报60.48美元，实际上涨了4%。Palantir 报18.47美元，下跌3.5%。

SoFi 确实收在了32美元以上，报32.21美元。如果我没记错，这是 SoFi 历史上首次收于32美元以上。它在一周前和今天早上曾触及32美元，然后回落，现在守住了32美元。所以，恭喜所有持有 SoFi 的人。32.21美元，日内上涨4%。我上周在28美元左右逢低买入了。我知道过去几周有很多人逢低买入。

Zeta 收于20美元以上也非常重要。这只股票多次触及20美元，然后回落。所以它能突破20美元非常不错，日内上涨3.36%。BMR 今天是收红还是收绿？我们实际上收绿了。一小时前还是红的。40.56美元，曾跌至39.42美元，也上涨了2.4%。

<p class="english-text">Thank you everybody for being here. It is Wednesday, November 12th, 4:00 PM and the stock market is now closed. All right, we are done for the day. We are closed on a Wednesday. I will keep an eye on if we get any 13Fs and 13Gs after the bell. We obviously have earnings, so we'll look into that.</p>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia went green at the close. 193.80. S&P 500 683. It inched out green by 0.04% which showed you a lot of that broadening trade as some market participants in the tech sector were down but the S&P 500 was up. The Q's just went red at the close tried to go green down by about 50 cents on the day. Open door great day. That's up 10.5%. Nebius got the $94 close which 94 is a very key level. So we'll see tomorrow if that can hold but $94 close. Very nice to see 94.36 for Nebius even though it was down 7% on the day. Robin Hood went green 132.98. Oaklo up 6.5%. Bitcoin just below 102,000. Coreweave was down about 3.35%. Iran down 3%. Nvidia again 193.80. You had grabbed 5.79 that's down 1.5%. Tesla was down 2% from 440 to 430. Hims down below 40 at $39. Delta at 60.48 that was actually up 4%.</p>
<p class="english-text">And then you had Palantir at 18.47 down 3.5. SoFi did get the $32 close, $32.21, I think. If I'm not wrong, this is the first time in history SoFi closed above 32. It touched 32 a couple times a week ago and then this morning, then it fell below and now it's holding 32. So, congratulations to everyone in SoFi. 32.21. I did buy the dip last week at around 28. I know a lot of people bought the dip over the past couple weeks. SoFi right here, 32.21, up 4% of the day.</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Zeta closing above 20 is also really important. I mean, this thing touches 20 so many times, but then it falls back. So, the fact that it actually made a move above 20 is very nice. That's up 3.36% on the day. BMR, did we get red for the day? We actually got green. It was red an hour ago. 40.56 went to 39.42. That was up 2.4% as well.</p>

### 盘后财报速递：思科、DLocal 与 Serve Robotics

好的，我们看到 Serve Robotics 正在下跌，跌了7%。然后是思科，我马上看他们的数字，微涨。还有 DLO。请告诉我你们持有哪只股票。根据投票，46%的人认为思科会表现出色，22%认为是 Serve，32%认为是 DLO。

Serve 怎么了？它下跌了7%。我看到聊天区很多人提 DLO。好的，看来有不少人持有 DLO。我还没拿到他们的财报数据。

Circle 今天早上公布了财报。我不知道为什么他们跌得那么惨，但最终还是下跌了。我对这个业务了解不多，只知道是做稳定币的。Circle 当天收跌约12%。Serve 下跌3%。哇，他们每股亏损54美分，而预期是亏损32美分，亏损幅度比预期大了69%。所以他们亏损超预期。营收为68.7万美元，预期为69.1万美元，营收未达标1%。每股收益同比下降170%，营收同比增长210%。

DLO 是在上涨还是下跌？DLO 在下跌，跌了5%。现在跌了8%。天哪，这只股票被重创了。思科是唯一一只还算稳住的。Serve 现在下跌9%，DLO 下跌6%。

我还没有财报数据，应该很快就会有了。看起来可能是营收和利润双双未达标，这可能是个问题。哇，美联储主席柯林斯表示，额外的支持有可能会阻碍通胀进展，认为近期进一步放宽政策的门槛相对较高。柯林斯倾向于在一段时间内保持利率稳定。老兄，如果美联储真的在12月不降息，会使市场上的很多问题复杂化。我不敢相信他们居然说现在不是降息的时候。

他们认为通胀比劳动力市场更令人担忧。我们得看看。美联储需要多数票才能做出决定。这不像最高法院的裁决，多数票获胜。所以我们真的要看事态如何发展。Serve 下跌7%，DLO 现在下跌9%。顺便说一下，美联储降息的概率也是过去几周最低的，为65%，所以12月是否降息仍然是个问题。DLO 仍然没有财报，下跌12%。为什么跌得这么惨？

我拿到数据了吗？还没有。市场预期每股收益16美分，营收2.62亿美元。这是市场对营收和利润的预期。哦，它在反弹吗？它在起死回生吗？跌到了13美元。也许那次下跌是个假动作，因为还没有财报数据。Serve 也在试图反弹一点。现在又回落到下跌3%。这只股票波动很大。

<p class="english-text">Okay, we have Serve Robotics that is dumping. Serve that's down uh 7%. Then we have Cisco. I'll get their numbers in a second. That's up a little bit. And then DLO. Let me know which one of these stocks you guys are in. If people are in it, what did people say on the poll? 46% say Cisco will outperform. 22% say serve. And then 32% say DLO.</p>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, what's going on with serve? Let's see what's down. Serve right here. Down 7%. I see a lot of DLO in the chat. Okay, so decent amount of people in DLO. Don't have their numbers yet. Let me see if we can get it.</p>
<p class="english-text">Circle did have earnings this morning. I don't know why they fell as hard as they did, but you know, they ended up falling. I don't know enough about this business. I know it's in stable coins, but Circle right there down about 12% on the day. Serve right there down 3%. Wow, they missed by 69% 54 cents versus 32 cents expected on the negative basis. So they lost more than expected. Revenue was 687,000 versus 691,000. They missed by 1% on EPS. EPS is down 170% year-over-year. Revenue is up 210% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="english-text">Is DLO pumping? DLO is dumping. Down 5%. Now it's down 8%. Goodness gracious. This one's getting hit. Cisco is the only one that's holding on a little bit. Serve now down 9%. DLO down 6%.</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh, don't have the earnings yet. I should be getting it very soon. Don't have it yet. It looks like it might have been a double miss, which could have been an issue. Wow. Fed President Collins, additional support risks stalling inflation progress. See relatively high bar for further easing near-term. Fed's Collins favors holding rates steady for some time. Dude, if the Fed really is not going to cut rates in December, it complicates a lot of issues in this market. I cannot believe they're actually saying that we think it's not time to cut.</p>
<p class="english-text">They think inflation is more of a concern than the labor market right now. We're going to have to see. There needs to be a majority decision for the Fed to go one way or the other. It's not like a Supreme Court decision where the majority wins. So, it's like we're really going to have to see what plays out. serve right there down 7% DLO now down 9% again the probabilities for a Fed rate cut are also the lowest it's been in the past couple weeks at 65% so that is still a question for December. DLO still don't have the results down 12% why is it getting hit this bad?</p>
<p class="english-text">um do I have the numbers I don't have the numbers the street wants 16 cents a share and then 262 million. At least that's what the street is expecting on the top and bottom line. Oh, is it coming back? Is it coming back to life? Fell to 13. I mean, maybe that dump was a head fake because there are no numbers. Uh, serve also trying to come back a little bit. Now it's back down to 3%. This one's not easily making moves.</p>
</details>

### 思科财报详解：需求强劲，指引超预期

思科在上涨。哇，思科不常这么动。思科是2000年代的股票，它不常这样波动。哇，思科上涨了5%。它白天已经上涨了3%。我们来看看思科的财报数据。思科在数据中心网络领域是一家非常重要的公司。所以他们公布非常好的数据对整个AI行业都很重要，即使他们不是最大的AI玩家。

每股收益超出预期2%，为1美元，预期为98美分。营收超出预期1%，为148亿美元，预期为147亿美元。每股收益同比增长10%，营收同比增长8%。虽然不是大幅超出预期，但确实是超出了。我看看能不能从他们的投资者页面找到一些具体的头条新闻，但这足以让市场说：“嘿，我们喜欢这个。”

财年调整后每股收益指引为4.14美元，而市场预期为4.06美元。好的，所以调整后每股收益高于预期，可能是因为利润率好于预期。利润率上升可能是由于需求旺盛或AI领域效率更高。股价77.37美元。哇，思科现在年初至今上涨了25%（不含盘后涨幅）。这太不可思议了。这是一个不常这样波动的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cisco is pumping. Cisco is pumping. Wow. Cisco doesn't move this often. Cisco is a stock from the 2000s. This one does not move like that. Wow. 5% on Cisco. It was already up 3% during the day. Let's see what these Cisco numbers are. And Cisco is a really important company in the context of networking for data centers. So them putting up really good numbers matters for the overall AI trade, even if they're not like the biggest AI player.</p>
<p class="english-text">Beat by 2% on EPS, a dollar versus 98 cents. Beat by 1% on revenue, 14.8 billion versus 14.7. EPS is up 10% year-over-year. revenue is up 8% year-over-year. Not massive massive beats, but they are indeed beats. Let me see if I can get some specific headlines from their investor page, but it's enough for the market to say, "Hey, we like it."</p>
<p class="english-text">Fiscal year adjusted EPS $4.14. The street thought it was going to be $4.06. Okay, so adjusted EPS is higher than expected likely because margins are better than expected. margins going up is likely due to either a lot of demand or a lot more efficiency in the world of AI. 77.37. Wow. Cisco now year to date is up without the after hours move 25%. That's incredible. This is a name that doesn't move that often like that.</p>

### DLocal财报解读：业绩亮眼为何股价下跌？

DLO 仍然受挫，下跌11%。我还没拿到 DLO 的数据。哦，我拿到了。DLO 是双双超预期。每股收益17美分，预期16美分，超出6%。营收2.82亿美元，预期2.62亿美元，超出8%。每股收益同比增长90%，营收同比增长52%。那市场到底对什么不满，让它下跌7%？

肯定是数据中有其他东西让市场不满意。但 DLO 下跌，Serve Robotics 仍然下跌，而思科是上涨的。盘后还没有13F报告。我会继续关注。我们可能明天会看到大部分。

DLO 下跌7.4%。思科仍然保持4%的涨幅。Serve 下跌6%。标普500指数盘后微动。Palantir 和 SoFi 也是。看，SoFi 盘后32.33美元。Meta 盘后微涨。

DLO，哦，它反弹了吗？刚才不是还跌11%吗？现在它几乎要转绿了。现在只跌1%。天哪，它真的能转绿吗？我们能看到反转吗？这太不可思议了。仍然下跌2%。看那根绿色的蜡烛图，盘后波动太剧烈了。我认为它在双双超预期的财报出来之前就下跌了，现在财报出来了，但市场似乎又喜欢又不喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">DLO still getting hit down 11. I still don't have DLO numbers. Oh, I got them. DLO, it's a double beat. It's a double beat. 17 cents versus 16 expected, that's a beat by 6%. Revenue 282 versus 262, that's a beat by 8%. EPS is up 90% year-over-year. Revenue is up 52% year-over-year. What is the street upset about to take her down 7%?</p>
<p class="english-text">It's got to be something else in the data street's not happy with, but you got DLO that's down. Serve Robotics is still down and Cisco is green. No 13Fs yet after the bell. I'll keep an eye on them. We might get the majority of them tomorrow, but nothing yet after the bell.</p>
<p class="english-text">DLO down 7.4. Cisco still holding four. Serve down six. S&P moving a little bit after hours. So is Palantir. So is SoFi. Look at that. 32.33 on SoFi. Meta's up a little bit after hours.</p>
<p class="english-text">DLO. Oh, did it come back? Wasn't it just down 11%. Wasn't it just down 11% and now it's It almost just went green, dude. Now it's down 1%. Dude, can it can it actually go green? Can we actually Can we actually do a reversal right here? That is incredible, dude. Still down 2%. There is that green candle, dude. That is moving like crazy after hours. I think it went down before the double beat even came out and now the double beat is out. But the street kind of likes it, kind of doesn't like it.</p>
</details>

让我们回到思科。这是一些关于思科的报道。
“这是一个全面的胜利。调整后每股收益为1美元，强于预期。营收为148.8亿美元，也强于预期。我们再看第二季度的每股收益指引，这个范围高于市场预期。第二季度营收指引也是如此，全年指引也是如此。尽管政府停摆，这个指引仍然非常强劲。思科在联邦政府销售方面有很大的敞口。他们在财报中表示，CEO查克·罗宾斯（Chuck Robbins）引用说，对他们技术的广泛需求起到了巨大作用，他们看到数十亿美元的园区网络更新机会开始增加，因为所有老化的网络设备都需要改造。所有这些都帮助股价上涨了3.5%。”

好的，思科显示出充足的需求。网络设备最终需要更换。如果你要升级大量数据中心，那么这可能是思科的一个看涨理由，盘后上涨4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get to Cisco. Here's some coverage on what we're seeing on Cisco and uh then we'll keep going from there. >> It's a beat across the board. So, we'll start with a dollar flat adjusted EPS earnings per share that was stronger than anticipated on revenues of 14.88 billion dollars. Also stronger than anticipated. We're talking about the Q2 EPS guidance. Keep in mind that this is we're talking about the past Q1. So now this is the guidance for Q2. That range is higher than what the stream anticipated. The same thing for the Q2 revenue guidance. Same thing for the full-year guidance. And this guide is stronger, much stronger despite the government shutdown. Cisco does have a lot of exposure to the federal government in terms of sales. They did say in their earnings report, there's a quote from uh Chuck uh the CEO Chuck Robbins who said that the widespread demand for their technologies playing a huge role and they're seeing a lot of a multi-billion dollar campus refresh opportunity starting to ramp up because of all the aging networking gear that needs to be revamped. So all of this helping shares go up three and a half% guys.</p>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Cisco showing there's plenty of demand. I mean, I'll try to get some deeper numbers on what they're saying right here, but network equipment does eventually need to be replaced. And if you're upgrading a lot of these data centers, then maybe that is one of the bull cases for Cisco up 4% after hours.</p>
</details>

Serve 仍然受挫，下跌5%。DLO 基本下跌5%，没有太大波动。我看看 DLocal 的财务数据。天哪，这家公司的数字，我虽然不太了解，但看起来非常酷。创纪录的季度。**TPV**（Total Payment Volume: 总支付额）创下104亿美元的新高，同比增长60%。营收增长52%。毛利润1亿美元。他们实现了GAAP盈利。净利润同比增长93%。

DLO 的 CEO 表示：“我们又交付了一个创纪录的季度，TPV 首次超过100亿美元，毛利润超过1亿美元，再次证明了我们的强劲增长和持续多元化。所有这些都凸显了我们商业模式的潜力和韧性。”

这只股票有人喜欢吗？我想 Tanner 和 Couch 喜欢这只股票，对吧？DLO 下跌5%。这看起来是个相当不错的季度。不确定为什么股价下跌。肯定有更深层次的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Serve still getting hit down 5%. DLOC basically down 5%. Not really making a move up or down, but that is getting hit. Let me see if there's dlocal uh financials we can look at. Dude, the numbers on this, I don't know that much about this company, but the numbers on it look pretty freaking cool. Record setting quarter. TPV record high of 10.4 billion, growing 60% year-over-year. Revenues up 52%. Gross profit 100 million. They are gap profitable. Net income up 93% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh we delivered another record quarter, the first time with TPV above US 10 billion in gross profit that surpassed US 100 million and one more example of our strong growth and continue diversification. All of which underscore the potential and resilience of our business model, said the CEO of DLO. Does Tanner like this stock? I think Tanner and Couch like this stock, right? Is this a name that they like? Uh DLO right here down 5%. I mean that looks like a pretty good quarter. Not sure why the stock is down. It's got to be something deeper for why the stock's getting hit, but that one's down.</p>
</details>

有人说是因为利润率。我不知道利润率的对比情况。我会试着看看。但如果他们因为利润率而打压股价，而忽略了增长，这意味着市场更关注效率而非营收增长，这没问题，因为利润率一直是所有财报的焦点。但在早期阶段，如果你以52%的速度增长，你将不得不牺牲一些利润率来换取增长。Palantir 的酷之处在于他们没有为增长牺牲利润率，这是市场非常喜欢的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because of margins. Yeah. I mean, like, well, I see. I don't know what the margin comparison is. I'll try to take a look at that. But if they're going to take it down because of margins and ignore the growth, it means the street's more focused on efficiency versus topline growth, which is fine because, you know, uh, margin has been the story for all the EPS that we've seen. But in these early days, you're going to have to sacrifice some margin for growth if you are growing at, you know, 52%. The cool thing about Palantir is they're not sacrificing margin for growth, which is what the street really likes.</p>
</details>

### 其他值得关注的公司动态

Serve Robotics，我试着看看他们发布了什么。他们营收67万美元，不算强劲，但我猜其他指标更重要。配送量环比增长66%，同比增长300%。与 DoorDash 达成为期多年的战略合作伙伴关系，在芝加哥启动。第三季度营收68.7万美元，同比增长2倍。季度末流动性强劲，为2.1亿美元，并通过稀释筹集了1亿美元。他们部署了1000个机器人。每日供应小时数比2024年第三季度增长了713%以上。这难道不是一家最终会被优步（Uber）收购的公司吗？这感觉就像是优步一个非常明显的收购目标。市值不到10亿美元。优步可能不需要收购，因为合作关系很好，但最终如果他们能够实现有意义的增长，你会认为优步会成为收购方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Serve Robotics, let me try to pull up them and see what they put out. Again, they did 670,000 in revenue. Not really the strongest, but I guess the other metrics matter a little bit more. Delivery volumes is up 66% quarter-over-quarter, 300% year-over-year. Multi-year strategic partnership with Door Dash launched in Chicago. Third quarter revenue of 687,000. That's up 2x year-over-year. End of the quarter with strong liquidity of 210 million. And they raised 100 million through dilution. They have a thousand robots deployed. Daily supply hours increased by over 713% compared to third quarter of 2024. Wouldn't this be a company that Uber eventually buys out? Like this just feels like such an obvious buyout play for Uber. Market cap is less than a billion. I mean Uber probably doesn't need to buy because the partnership works so well with them, but eventually these guys actually can meaningfully grow. You would think that Uber would be a player to uh to buy them.</p>
</details>

OpenDoor 盘后仍在波动，CEO 购买了100万股股票，市场喜欢这个消息。OpenDoor 的联合创始人说，他愿意和一个推特账户打赌10万美元，到2032年 OpenDoor 的市值将超过 Shopify，这意味着 OpenDoor 的市值需要达到约2000亿美元。现在是70亿美元。所以也许这也让股东们兴奋不已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Open Door still moving after hours CEO bought a million of stock. Market likes it. Open door right there down a little bit, up 10% on the day. Again, the co-founder of Open Door said that he will bet $100,000 with some Twitter account that um it was just some some Twitter account. I don't know the name of the person, but they made a public bet of 100,000 bucks that Open Door will be more valuable than Shopify by 2032, which means Openoro would need a market valuation of around 200 billion. It's now at seven billion. So maybe that also created a lot of excitement in shareholders because the co-founders, you know, talking about a $200 billion market cap.</p>
</details>

Firefly 财报后大涨。第三季度业绩：营收环比增长98%，同比增长38%。他们完成了一项收购，获得了2.6亿美元的循环信贷额度，从NASA获得了1.76亿美元的合同，以及1000万美元的“蓝鬼”任务合同。他们重申了2025年1.5亿至1.58亿美元的营收指引。所以，营收大幅超出预期，确认了从NASA获得的新合同，循环信贷额度增加总是好事，意味着他们有信贷和流动性，并且指引保持不变。Firefly 上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firefly. What's there? Oh look at that. 10.7% move. They IPOed this year. Okay, Google lied to me. Or maybe it was a rebrand. I thought they IPOed this year, too. I remember hearing their name. Google saying they went public in 2007. They might have just recently IPOed again. Yes, earnings IPO 45. Okay, let's see if we can get some of the numbers on Firefly and what's going on here. Um, third quarter results. We have revenues up 98% quarter-over-quarter, 38% year-over-year. Uh they closed an acquisition, 260 million revolving credit facility, 176 million contract from NASA, 10 million blue ghost mission. They reiterated the revenue guidance of 150 to 158 million for 2025. Okay, so you have a pretty big beat on revenue. New contract that they're confirming that they got from NASA. uh revolving credit facility going up is always a good thing. Means they have access to credit and liquidity and guidance of 150 million that continues to be green. All right, Firefly is up.</p>
</details>

Grab 今天下跌了。有一篇文章报道了关于 GoTo 的传闻，基本上显示 Grab 的 CEO Anthony Tan 对这次收购非常认真。有高管之间的私人会议正在进行，这些会议受到软银决定罢免CEO的影响。这是一个需要观察的传奇故事。我认为这会重新评估公司。也许不会，但我认为到12月底，我们会对情况有更清楚的了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Grab did lose $6 today. Quick update on them. There was an article that came out around this whole Goto saga. And um, basically it showed that Anthony Tan is getting very serious about this acquisition, the CEO of Grab. So, um, essentially saying that there's private meetings now going on between executive officials and these meetings are influenced by SoftBank's decision to get rid of the CEO. I mean, it is saga that we're going to have to see play out. I do think it rerates the company. Maybe it doesn't, but I think towards the end of December, we're gonna have a much better understanding of what's going on there.</p>

Flutter，一家大型博彩公司，财报后下跌。第三季度营收37.9亿美元，预期38.6亿美元，未达标。Flutter 预计财年调整后**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）为9.35亿美元，低于之前的12.5亿美元。第三季度月活跃玩家1410万，预期1470万。他们正在与 FanDuel 推出新的预测市场平台。Flutter 股价因营收未达标盘后下跌5%。

这与我昨天和 Jason 谈论 DraftKings 的看法类似。我对博彩股不那么看好，仅仅因为我认为 Khi 和 Poly Market，以及 Robinhood，正在抢走他们的用户。我不想说他们正在抢走用户，因为如果我没了解过预测市场，我可能永远不会成为 DraftKings 的用户。但我确实认为这些交易的一些兴奋点和势头正在被投入到预测市场，特别是体育预测市场。这些交易量没有流向 Flutter 或 DraftKings。这可能成为这些股票的一个更广泛的问题。

<p class="english-text">Flutter, that's a big gambling stock. Flutter is down 3% after hours, by the way. Looks like their earnings were pretty good. We'll look at in actually no it looks like it was bad. Looks like they missed on a couple aspects. Flutter third quarter revenue 3.79 versus 3.86. That's a miss. Flutter sees fiscal year adjusted EBIT of 935 million. That's down from 1.25 billion. Third quarter monthly players 14.1 million versus 14.7 expected. They are now unveiling a new prediction markets platform with FanDuel and Fluttershares are down 5% after hours on missing on revenue.</p>
<p class="english-text">This is kind of the same take I had yesterday with Jason about DraftKings. I am not that bullish on the gambling stocks simply because I think Khi and Poly Market in addition to Robin Hood. I don't want to say they're taking away their users because maybe I would have never been a DraftKings user if I had never learned about prediction markets, but I do think some of the excitement and momentum on those trades are being put into prediction markets, especially the sports prediction markets. And that's volumes that's not going to Flutter or to DraftKings. And so that could be a broader issue for those stocks.</p>

### 机构投资者动态：13F报告初步观察

我正在查看是否有更新的13F报告。我没看到什么特别的。我们可能明天会得到。让我们看看 Bridgewater 是否出来了。这是雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）的公司，尽管他不再管理了。Bridgewater 还没出来。霍华德·马克斯（Howard Marks）的 Oaktree Capital Management 也没出来。

First Eagle Investment Management，管理着540亿美元。他们卖出了一些甲骨文和 Meta，增持了谷歌。这是截至第三季度的数据。他们新买入了 Workday 和 Omnicom。他们还买入了 Pan-American Silver，进入了大宗商品交易。

Linedale Train，管理着40亿美元。他们增持了10%的谷歌，减持了7%的TKO，25%的eBay，1%的PayPal。他们增持了加拿大太平洋铁路和雅诗兰黛（Estee Lauder）。他们卖出了一点可口可乐。他们增持了30%的Adobe。我们都知道Adobe便宜，问题是在当前叙事下，便宜是好事吗？他们卖出了50%的甲骨文。

很多基金，我们在9月30日结束第三季度。我不会惊讶地看到甲骨文在第三季度被卖出最多的股票名单上，因为它在9月10日飙升至350美元。我想象一些基金会说：“嘿，我们要抛售这只股票，因为我们在200美元买的，不到24小时就到了300美元。”

Himalaya Capital 的李录（Li Lu），他管理着32亿美元。看起来他什么都没做。谷歌、伯克希尔、美国银行、苹果和西方石油。还有拼多多。显然没有买卖任何东西。他是巴菲特的好朋友。哦，这就是为什么他有5亿美元的伯克希尔。李录是喜马拉雅资本的创始人和主席。他信奉本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）、沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）和查理·芒格（Charlie Munger）的价值投资原则。

<p class="english-text">I will check right now if we have any 13Fs that are updated. Uh I'm not seeing anything too crazy. If we don't get it today, we'll likely get it tomorrow. Let's see if Bridgewater is out. This is Ray Dalio, even though he doesn't run it anymore. Bridgewater not out yet. Um let's see. Howard Marks, is that one out yet? Oak Tree Capital Management. That one's not out yet.</p>
<p class="english-text">First Eagle Investment Management, they manage $54 billion. Um, they have a lot of buys and sells. They sold some of their oracles, sold some of their Meta, added more of their Google. This is all as of Q3. Um, they bought Workday and Omnicom. Those are brand new buys.</p>
<p class="english-text">Linddale train. These guys managed 4 billion. Uh they added 10% to Google, reduced 7% of TKO, reduced 25% of eBay, reduced 1% of PayPal. They added in Canadian Pacific. They added Estee Lauder. They sold a little bit of their Coke. They added 30% to Adobe. We all know Adobe's cheap. The question is, is cheap good given the narrative on them. They sold 50% of their oracle.</p>
<p class="english-text">a lot of these funds, you know, a lot I mean, we ended Q3, what, September 30th? I would not be surprised to see Oracle on a list of the top most sold stocks in Q3 because um it pumped to 350 on September 10th. Like, I would imagine some of these funds were like, "Hey, we're gonna dump this stock because we bought it at 200 and it's at 300 in less than 24 hours."</p>
<p class="english-text">Himalaya capital Leelu. He manages 3.2 billion. Is this the guy? Dude, this guy is epic. Leelu. Do you guys know this guy? Himalaya Capital Management. It looks like he did nothing. Google, Bergkshire, Bank of America, Apple, and Oxy. And then Pinduoduo. Didn't buy or sell anything apparently. He's Buffett's good friend. Oh, that's why he has $500 million of Birkshshire, dude. Leelu is the founder and chairman of Himalaya Capital. It was founded in 1997. Oh wow. We embrace the value investment principles of Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger.</p>

### 宏观经济观察：房地产与美联储政策

关于房地产方面，上周抵押贷款需求有所回升。尽管我们正进入房地产最淡的季节，但购房者似乎在做最后的努力，可能是因为市场上有更多供应和价格软化。根据抵押贷款银行家协会的数据，上周购房抵押贷款申请上升了6%，达到自9月以来的最强劲水平。成交量比去年同期高出31%。

尽管30年期固定利率贷款的平均利率从6.31%上升到6.34%，但这个利率比一年前低了52个基点。所有贷款类型的购买需求都有所上升，包括常规贷款、**FHA**（Federal Housing Administration: 联邦住房管理局）贷款和**VA**（Department of Veterans Affairs: 退伍军人事务部）贷款。

至于再融资需求，则不那么强劲。上个月还很强劲，但上周下降了3%，不过仍比一年前同期高出147%。

<p class="english-text">Some movement on the housing front with demand for mortgages ticking up last week. Mortgage applications to buy a home rose 6% last week to their strongest pace since September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Now, volume was 31% higher than the same week one year ago. This despite the fact that the average rate on the 30-year fix for conforming loans rose to 6.34% from 6.31 for loans with 20% down. That rate though is 52 basis points lower than it was a year ago. Purchase demand rose for all loan types, conventional, FHA, and VA as potential home buyers continue to shop around for the best deals. Now, as for refinance demand, not so much. It had been strong last month, but dropped 3% for the week, still 147% higher than the same week a year ago.</p>

此外，白宫正在探索一种“可移动抵押贷款”的方式。基本上，如果你在2020年买房时锁定了2.75%的抵押贷款利率，现在想搬家，白宫正在研究一种方法，让你能把同样的利率和贷款机构带到新房子。联邦住房管理局能让这成为可能吗？是的。这对经济来说是最健康的事情吗？我不知道。但这可能是白宫正在考虑让住房更可负担的一种方式。

<p class="english-text">Oh, we were talking about Fanny Mae saying that, hey, maybe the 620 credit score should be re-looked, bring that down. Today, there's some headlines saying that, well, we should have um movable mortgages. So, basically, if you have a 2.75% mortgage on your home that you bought in 2020 and you want to move, the White House is exploring a way, as for Politico, to take that same rate and the same lender you have and bring it to a new house. Can the federal housing administration make that possible? Yes. Is that the healthiest thing for the economy? I don't know. That would be a moving mortgage. And you know, that could be something that the uh the White House is thinking of making housing more affordable.</p>

### 美联储降息前景不明朗

美联储官员柯林斯再次发表鹰派言论，为不应降息提供了论据。她说，金融状况是经济增长的顺风，经济活动一直保持得很好。额外的货币支持有可能会减缓或阻碍通胀回到美联储2%的目标。就业存在下行风险，但自夏季以来并未增加。她对在没有劳动力市场进一步疲软证据的情况下进一步放宽政策持犹豫态度。

重点是，现在似乎有了一批关键官员，我不知道是否是多数，但有一批关键官员要么直接反对降息，要么建议美联储应放慢脚步。目前尚不清楚这是否占12名投票委员的一半，但已经很接近了。这与市场形成对比，在柯林斯讲话前，市场预测12月降息的概率为64%，现在降至61%。

如果12月的通胀报告能按时发布，那将是在12月17日，也就是美联储为期两天的会议的第二天。所以，这真的很有趣。美联储内部肯定存在分歧，而且是实质性的分歧。我认为如果他们真的降息，可能会有三到四个反对票，甚至可能有多达五到六人反对降息。

<p class="english-text">Here is the news on uh the Fed Collins again. Another Fed president turning into a hawk and making the argument for why we shouldn't cut. She says financial conditions are a tailwind for economic growth and economic activity has been holding up quite well. She says additional monetary support risk slowing or stalling the return of inflation to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. There are downside risks to employment, she says, but they have not increased since the summer. And she's hesitant to ease further without evidence of a further weakening of the labor market.</p>
<p class="english-text">The importance here, guys, it looks like there is now a critical mass of officials. I don't know if it's a a majority, but a critical mass of officials either outright opposing a rate cut or suggesting the Fed should go more slowly. It's unclear if it's half of the 12 voters that you need or six of them, but it's close. This contrast with a market that before Collins spoke moments ago when her headlines came out, there was a 64% probability of a December rate cut. It's now 61%.</p>
<p class="english-text">If the December inflation report comes out on time, that's a big if, will be issued December 17th, and that's day two of the Fed's two-day meeting. So guys, this is really interesting at this point. There is definitely a divide on the Fed. It's a substantial divide at this point where I would think you could have three maybe even four descents if they do cut and there may be as many as five or six who oppose a cut at this point.</p>

老兄，如果我们得不到这次降息，天哪。我不认为这意味着我们会回到十月份的低点，比如标普640点。我只是认为，任何对年底前出现有意义反弹的希望都将被扼杀。所以，这不一定是熊市，但肯定不是牛市。这就是问题所在。我们得看看会发生什么。但得不到降息不是好事。是的，那个“圣诞老人行情”可能会泡汤了。

<p class="english-text">Dude, if we don't get this rate cut, oh my goodness. I don't think it means we like go back to the lows of October like 640 on the S&P. I just think any hope of like a meaningful run towards the end of the year gets squashed. So, it doesn't have to be bearish, but it's definitely not bullish. And that's the issue. And we're gonna have to see what ends up happening. But they're not getting a rate cut is not going to be good. Yeah, that Santa Claus rally is gonna be a little cooked.</p>

我们可能还会得到一些宏观数据。白宫说我们不会得到CPI和就业数据，但明天可能会有部分数据公布，这些数据也很重要。
