### 明尼苏达欺诈案

**Jason**: 好了，各位好基友（Besties），今天我们有一场重磅节目，但今天不是我们的预测专题。我们原计划在年底做预测，但新闻中有很多精彩的故事需要报道，所以我们将预测推迟到下周。第一个故事是，我们邀请到了调查记者 **Nick Shirley**。他在一段播放量破亿的 42 分钟爆火视频中，揭露了**明尼苏达州** 1.1 亿美元的潜在欺诈行为。这是该州总计 **90 亿美元**福利欺诈的一部分。我们今天独家邀请到了他。这段视频显然引起了 **Cash Patel** 和国土安全部部长 **Christy Noem** 的关注，他们已经派遣特工去检查这些设施。这里有一些重要的背景：明尼苏达州的这些权利欺诈（Entitlement Frauds）已经持续了 10 多年。这是一个有 13、14 年历史的老故事了。它最早是由一位名叫 **Jeff Baillon** 的调查记者发起的，他在 2013 年 2 月在 **Fox 9 News** 进行了首次调查。在那次曝光后，2014 年对一名索马里妇女及其丈夫提出了指控，但他们弃保潜逃，从未接受审判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: All right, we have a massive show for you today, besties, but it's not going to be our prediction show. We thought we were doing predictions end of the year, but we had so many amazing stories to cover in the news that we're going to do predictions next week. The first story is we have investigative journalist Nick Shirley on. He has uncovered in a breaking 42-minute video that went viral $110 million in potential fraud in Minnesota. It's part of $9 billion in overall fraud. and we've got him on the show here exclusively. This video apparently perhaps prompted responses from Cash Patel and DHS Secretary Christy Noem who have sent agents in to inspect these facilities. Here's some sort of important context. These entitlement frauds in Minnesota have been going on for over 10 years. It's a 13 14 year old story. It started by an investigative reporter named Jeff Baillon. launched his first investigation into this in February of 2013 at Fox 9 News, local investigative journalist. Uh, and after that expose, charges were brought in 2014 against a Somali woman and her husband. They skip bow. They never faced trial.

</details>

**Jason**: 根据联邦检察官的说法，自 2018 年以来，明尼苏达州已经出现了约 90 亿美元的权利欺诈。为了让大家有个概念，这相当于该州 14 项福利计划总支出的**一半**。联邦检察官对明尼苏达州欺诈案的直接评价是：“严重程度怎么强调都不为过，简直令人震惊。”这是**工业化规模**的欺诈。自 2022 年以来，已有 90 多人因超过 8 亿美元的欺诈被定罪。2022 年，47 名被告在一个名为“**Feeding Our Future**”的 2.5 亿美元欺诈计划中被起诉，该计划本应为饥饿儿童提供食物。随后，高达 2.2 亿美元的自闭症儿童基金被盗。接着，3 亿多美元的医疗补助（Medicaid）资金被盗，这些资金本意是帮助残疾人避免无家可归。从 2022 年的那个欺诈案开始，被起诉的 92 人中有 82 人是**索马里裔**。现在加入我们的，是 23 岁的调查记者 **Nick Shirley**。欢迎来到节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Since 2018, Minnesota has seen 9 billion around 9 billion in entitlement frauds according to federal prosecutors. Just to give you guys a concept of what that means, that's half of the total amount spent on 14 entitlement programs in the state. So, here's the direct quote from the federal prosecutor on the Minnesota fraud. The magnitude cannot be overstated. It's staggering. Industrial-scale fraud. There have been over 90 convictions for more than $800 million in fraud since 2022. In 2022, 47 defendants were charged in a $250 million fraud scheme called Feeding Our Future that was supposed to feed hungry kids. Then up to 220 million was stolen in funds for kids with autism. Then 300 million was stolen in Medicaid funds meant to help people with disabilities avoid homelessness. So starting with that feeding our futures fraud in 2022, 82 of 92 people charged have been Somalian. Joining us right now, 23-year-old investigative journalist Nick Shirley. Welcome to the program.

### 独立调查记者

**Nick Shirley**: 谢谢。这几天在明尼苏达州真的很疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Thank you. It's been a crazy past few days out here in Minnesota.

</details>

**Jason**: 我想最好的开始方式是，你可以向观众介绍一下你的背景，你是何时开始从事调查新闻的。显然，你有一个 **YouTube** 频道。我看过你 16、17 岁时的一些早期视频，我觉得有点像 **MrBeast** 的风格，然后突然转向了政治，特别是围绕移民的一些街头采访（Vox pop）。也许你可以告诉我们你是如何进入这一行，又是如何发现这个特定故事的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So I guess a good place to start is you could tell the audience a little bit about your background. when you got into investigative journalism. Obviously, you've got a YouTube channel. I watched some of your early videos when you were 16, 17 years old. I would say along the Mr. Beast vibes and then suddenly making a turn into politics specifically around immigration and some Vox pop kind of man on the street stuff. But maybe you could tell us a little bit of how you got into all this and how you got into this specific story.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 是的。我从高中二年级起就开始做 YouTube 了。那只是我觉得自己能做好的事情。高中时我只能拍一些恶搞视频、潜入某些地方，就是那种周末可以做的趣事。随着年龄增长和经历增加，我变得成熟了，想涉及更严肃的话题。当我能够去不同的国家看清世界的真相时，这引导我开始做调查新闻内容。而且，在 2020 年左右，你甚至无法在 YouTube 上制作政治内容而不被取消获利。例如，如果我在标题或缩略图中放入 **Trump**，我的频道就会被取消获利，因为我当时只是个小频道。所以那时不可能做这类内容，而且我当时只有 17、18 岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. So, I've been doing YouTube as far as I can pretty much remember since I was as a sophomore in high school. It was just something I thought I could would be good at. So, I'd do YouTube videos and all I could do in high school was to do prank videos, sneaking into places, just kind of a fun stuff you can do on the weekend. And then as I've grown older and I've had other experiences, um I've matured and I've wanted to get more into more serious topics. And so, uh, as I've been able to go places and kind of see the world for what it is in different countries and whatnot and have different experiences, um, it kind of led me to get into this more investigative journalism content. And also, back in around 2020, you couldn't even make political content on YouTube without being demonetized. For instance, if you were to put Trump in a YouTube title or thumbnail on my channel, you would get demonetized cuz I was a smaller channel. So, it was impossible to make that sort of content and I was younger. I was about 17, 18 years old at that time.

</details>

**Jason**: 现在 YouTube 允许你获利了。我注意到你的节目中植入了广告，就像许多播客一样。你并不隶属于任何新闻机构。据我所知，你没有得到任何特殊利益集团的支持，也没有亿万富翁的支持。你做这些报道的资金从何而来？请向观众确认一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And now YouTube allows you to monetize. I noticed you had ads baked into the program like many podcasters. And you're not affiliated with any news source. And I to the best of my knowledge, you're not backed by any special interest groups. You're not backed by some rich billionaire. Where's the money coming to do this reporting from? and and just to confirm that with the audience.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 是的，我所做的一切都是 100% 独立的。我的收入来自 YouTube 的分成和视频中的品牌合作。如果有人想捐款，也可以。但我所做的一切都是亲力亲为，除了我、我妈妈和几位剪辑师，没有其他人为我工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. Everything I do, I'm 100% independent and so I make my money off of YouTube, off of brand deals inside of YouTube videos. And if people want to donate money, they can do that. However, everything I do is straight from my own hands and I don't have any other people really working for me other than me, myself, my mom, and a few other editors.

</details>

### 揭露欺诈内幕

**Jason**: 请告诉我们这个故事的起源，然后我会把它交给其他好基友提问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So, tell us about the origin of this story, and then I'll hand it off to the rest of the besties to do some follow-up questions.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 是的。我关注这个欺诈案很久了。去年六月，我来到明尼苏达州，想拍一段关于索马里人口增长、某些城镇人口结构变化以及教堂如何变成清真寺的视频。我觉得这是一个有趣的话题。当我在那里时，很多人开始告诉我正在发生的欺诈。我当时想，我不能直接跑来给每个人贴上“正在发生欺诈”的标签，我需要证据。所以我一直在进行自己的调查。然后视频中出现了一个叫 **David** 的人，他多年来一直在进行自己的调查，因为他在一些托儿中心旁边工作，他开车经过时，从未在这些日托所见过一个孩子。于是他开始调查资金，他拿到了这些人从 **CCAP**（托儿援助计划）获得的资金数据，这些钱是免税的，而且高达数百万美元。所以我告诉他：“好，我要去明尼苏达州。我们去看看这些日托所到底发生了什么。”当我到达那里时，我被震惊了。我们去的第一家日托所，所有的窗户都被封死了，你甚至没法开门，全部都锁着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. So, I've been looking into this fraud for a long time. Since last June, I came to Minnesota to kind of do a video on what was happening with the Somali population as far as like how much it was increasing and and how certain towns have been uh the demographics have changed um and how churches are turning into mosque and how mosques are growing inside of Minnesota. I thought it'd be an interesting topic for people to see. And when I was there, a lot of people were starting to tell me about the fraud that was taking place. And I was like, well, how do I I just can't come and label everyone saying there's fraud happening. I need evidence. I need actual proof. And so I I've been doing my own investigation. And then a man by the name of David who's inside my YouTube video, he's been doing his own investigation for years as he's as he works next to some of these childcare centers and he's driven by and he's never seen a single child at any of these daycarees. And so he started looking into the funding and he was able to get the numbers of how much money these people were receiving from CCAP funding which is tax exempt and it was in the millions of dollars. And so I was I told him, "All right, I'm coming to Minnesota. Let's go see what's happening on these daycarees." And when I got there, I was shocked to see when the first daycare we went to, all the windows were blacked out and you didn't even have the option to open the door. Everything was locked.

</details>

**Jason**: 请解释一下欺诈的机制，以便没看过视频的观众了解这些欺诈是如何运作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So explain the the mechanics of the fraud just so the audience if they haven't seen this understand how these frauds are being played out.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 是的。这是大规模的福利欺诈。人们开设这些日托所、家庭护理诊所，凡是与健康福利或帮助他人有关的公司，他们都能获得数百万美元。而州政府，我不知道他们是否对这些地方进行过检查，因为这些地方门上的招牌甚至把“Learning”（学习）拼成了“Learing”。什么样的企业经营方式是让你甚至无法进入，或者窗户全部封死的？非常奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. So massive welfare frauds being committed. People are opening up these daycarees, home healthcare clinics, you name it. anything that has anything to do with like health welfare or even just like helping people in general like with daycare or with uh healthcare, they're opening up these companies and then they're able to receive millions of dollars. And the state, for instance, I don't know if they're doing any checkups on these places because these places literally had signs that said learing instead of learning on their on their doors on outside. And what business is operating in a way where you can't even go inside or the windows are all blocked out? Very strange.

</details>

### 媒体失职与政治

**Chamath**: Nick，让我问你一个很多人都会问的问题。首先，我想说你的视频非常有勇气，制作精良，你用非常简单的方式传达了一些非常复杂的信息，这是一项了不起的技能。但大家都会问：我们如何知道你是对的？在传统的调查新闻中，有一套流程，你需要购买保险，需要处理法律问题。你在制作这个视频时经历过这些流程吗？你认为这对于你的公信力和作品的立足点是否重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Nick, let me ask you a question that I think a lot of people have, which is when your video, first of all, let me just say, took a lot of courage and it was well produced and you communicated some very complicated information in a very simple way, which I think is a tremendous skill. But the question that everybody asks is how do we know that you are right? And in traditional investigative journalism, there's a process that people follow and there's insurance that you have to get and then there's errors and omissions and you typically have to deal with lawyers. Did you go through that process when you made this? And do you think that it's an important part of what needs to be done for your credibility and for this piece to stand on its own?

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 我觉得大家都知道欺诈已经存在很多年了。就像 Jason 刚才说的，大家都知道欺诈正在发生，但没有人真正去亲眼看看。这就是为什么主流媒体很难曝光这些欺诈，因为他们从未亲眼见过，或者没有一个可以自由分享的平台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah, I think everyone knows that fraud's been going on for years now. Like Jason was just saying, everyone knows that the fraud's being committed, but nobody's actually went to go see it firsthand. They know this fraud's been happening, right? And that's why it's been so hard for people to say, "Well, this is happening." Or this is why mainstream media's had such a hard time to actually get exposure on the fraud because they've actually never gone and seen it firsthand or they've had the opportunity to have a platform where they can share on their own.

</details>

**Chamath**: 但你是否履行了《纽约时报》或其他机构那样的传统程序？因为我想探讨的是，如何确保你不会受到攻击、不会被抹黑、不会被起诉到破产？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Right. But did you check all the traditional boxes that the New York Times or other people? Because what I'm trying to get to is how do we make sure that then you're not attacked and that you're not discredited and that people say this process is faulty and he's mudslinging and how do we make sure that you're not sued into oblivion?

</details>

**Jason**: 补充一下，现在已经有指控出来了。比如“哦，你是周六去的”，“哦，你是圣诞节期间去的”。我想你可以回应一下，因为人们显然在审查你的新闻专业性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. And to specific to build on that Shimoth the allegation has come out. Oh, you went on a Saturday. Oh, you went during Christmas. And I guess you could address that because now people are obviously vetting your journalism.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 我是 12 月 16 日去的，那是圣诞假期前的一个工作日。至于审核的问题，帮助我领导调查的那个人 David，他有来自州议会的所有文件。州议会内部有人向他泄露信息。所以我的“事实核查”就是他有来自议会内部的消息源。这就是我们能得到具体数字的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. Well, it's on I went on December 16th is a weekday before Christmas break. So, there's that. And then, um, sorry, the question as far as like did I do the vetting and whatnot. The man who helped me like lead the investigation himself, David, he had all the paperwork from the capital. He had somebody from inside the capital leaking him the information. So, there was my like fact check, per se, was he had a source from inside the capital. That's how we were able to get the number specifically.

</details>

### 政治分赃体系

**Sacks**: 我认为这是对媒体的控诉。他们没有报道这件事，甚至现在还没报道 Nick 的视频，而正如你所说，这段视频已经疯传，播放量破亿。你面对的是一个巨大的、数十亿美元的欺诈。是的，Jason，正如你所说，有些故事可以追溯到十年前，但它们被描绘成孤立的事件。而 Nick 所做的是展示了这种欺诈是**大规模**的，而且就在众目睽睽之下，只是没有人关心或愿意去揭露它。Nick，你只是走访了这些所谓的日托中心，它们每年从政府领取 150 万到 400 万美元的代金券，而这些都是基于虚构的儿童入学人数。这些中心甚至没有运营，却在从政府领钱。总计加起来有 80 到 100 亿美元。所以这是从明尼苏达州偷走的**纳税人的钱**，基本上是被这个索马里社区偷走的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sacks**: Well, I think it's an indictment of the press. They haven't covered this and they still haven't covered Nick's video, which is now, like you said, a viral video with hundreds of millions of views and everyone can see what's happening. You basically have this huge multi-billion dollar fraud taking place. Yes, there were stories going back a decade like you said Jason, but they were isolated stories where they could be portrayed that way. And I think what Nick has done is show that the fraud is massive and in plain sight and no one bothered, no one cared enough to expose it. And you know, Nick, you did this by just going around to all these supposed daycare centers which are receiving vouchers from the government anywhere from what one and a half to $4 million per daycare center per year based on fictional enrollments of children. And these centers aren't even operating and they're collecting millions from the government. All told, I guess it's adds up to 8 to 10 billion. So this is taxpayer money that's being stolen from Minnesota that's being stolen by this Somali community basically.

</details>

**Sacks**: 这个故事之所以疯传，是因为它包含了功能失调的方方面面。你有非法移民的问题，索马里社区的一些人是非法来到这里的。然后你还有这些愚蠢的**进步派法官**，他们错误地撤销了一些诈骗者的定罪。这简直是“**自杀式同情**”的典型例子。然后还有政治腐败。这些不是孤立事件。我们必须将其视为一个正在运作的**系统**，而不仅仅是几个孤立的诈骗者。这里存在一种“回流”机制，通过这些欺诈流入索马里社区的一部分资金，最终回到了政客手中。一个极端的例子是，**Tim Walz** 甚至更改了明尼苏达州的州旗，使其看起来像索马里国旗。他降下了旧旗，升起了这面新旗，这显示了这个社区的政治影响力，也是为什么很多政客对发生的事情睁一只眼闭一只眼的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sacks**: And I think the story's gone viral because it includes so many aspects of dysfunction. I mean, you've got the issue of illegal immigrants. Some of the people in the Somali community got here illegally. Some of them didn't. You then have these progressive judges who foolishly voided convictions of some of the fraudsters who were doing this. I mean it's just um classic example of suicidal empathy or something like that. So you have that aspect of the story and then you've got the political corruption. Again these are not isolated incidents. This is a a case where I think we have to see this as a system at work not just an example of like a few isolated fraudsters. There's some round-tripping here where some of the funds that are going into the pockets of the Somali community through this fraud end up back in the hands of politicians. And the really extreme example of this is that Tim Walz even changed the flag of Minnesota to resemble the Somali flag. I mean, he lowered the old flag and raised this new flag to that resembles the Somali flag, which shows the political clout of this community, which is why I think a lot of politicians turned a blind eye to what was going on.

</details>

**Nick Shirley**: 是的，我非常赞同你说的。尤其是关于法官的部分，他们发现一个人诈骗了 700 万美元，然后法官推翻了判决。而 Tim Walz 称像我这样的人是在搞“白人至上主义”。不，Tim，这是辛勤工作的明尼苏达人被骗走的数亿、数十亿美元，这些钱不知道流向了哪里。今天我看到媒体上有人开始对我提出各种疯狂的指控，甚至有人说我是个恋童癖。这太离谱了。我只是做了大家多年来一直想看到的工作，把这件事曝光，并试图让它回归到一个简单的欺诈问题上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nick Shirley**: Yeah. No, I love everything you said because it's so true, especially like for instance, they found a man here with $7 million he had committed in fraud and then the judge overturned it, right? And then Tim Waltz is calling people like me a white sup white supremacy. He says we're acting on white supremacy. No, Tim, it's millions and billions of dollars in fraud of hardworking motan people that's being sent who knows where. And so it's not like and then today I'm just looking at the media and people are it was the craziest thing. I get on there and people are starting to say all these like crazy allegations about me. I'm like whoa where are you guys? People have even came out say said I'm like a a pedto. It's like what? Like I literally just went and did the job that everyone's been wanting to see done for years, right? And I just brought limelight to everything, tried to make it as uh just a simple issue about fraud happening.

### 加州资产税争议

**Jason**: 好了，我们要转到下一个话题，因为时间不够了。加州想要通过一项名为 **BTA** 的法案。这个法案代表“Besties to Austin”（好基友去奥斯汀）。开个玩笑。这项针对亿万富翁的税收将针对净资产超过 10 亿美元的居民。Freeberg，请向观众解释一下这是怎么回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Okay, but we have to get on to this next story because I don't want to run out of time for it, which is California wants to do an act called BTA. This act stands for Besties to Austin. Anyway, we brought this up back in October. This tax for billionaires is going to target residents with over a billion in net worth. Freeberg, why don't you walk the all-in audience through how this came to be?

</details>

**Freeberg**: 加州有一个直接民主的投票提案流程。任何人只要支付 2000 美元就可以发起提案，然后你需要收集大约 90 万个签名。一旦收集完成，它就会出现在下一次选票上。在这个特定的案例中，所谓的“**亿万富翁税法案**”提议对净资产超过 10 亿美元的人征收 **5% 的资产税**。这是由一个名叫 **Dave Regan** 的人提出的，他领导着 **SEIU**（服务业雇员国际工会），目的是弥补其成员面临的医疗保健资金缺口。这并不是由州政府或议会提出的，而是一个工会领导人为了特定目的发起的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: So, California has a direct democratic ballot process. So anyone can file for something to go on the ballot. When they make a filing, it costs $2,000. Anyone can file for a ballot measure and then you have to go collect signatures and you have to collect roughly 900,000 signatures. Once you've collected those signatures, it makes it on the next ballot. So in this particular case, the billionaire tax act as it's titled is a 5% tax on the assets of anyone that's got a net worth over a billion dollars. It was proposed by a guy named Dave Regan who runs SEIU which is one of the unions in order to make up for the healthcare shortfall that his members are going to be experiencing. So, this was not a broad coalition that filed this. This is not filed by the state. This is not filed by anyone in the Assembly or the Senate. This is one individual at one union that's put it forward and is now trying to collect signatures to get it put on the ball.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 我想让大家明白这一点：忘掉“亿万富翁”这个词，忘掉“财富”这个词。我们谈论的是有史以来第一次对个人**私有财产**征税，而不是对收入征税。目前的税收制度是，当你赚取收入（工资或卖出资产获利）时，你支付税款。而现在，他们提议的是，政府来问你：“你银行账户里有多少钱？你的车值多少钱？你祖母给你的珠宝值多少钱？把你家里所有东西的价值加起来，给我一个百分比。”这本质上是**私有财产没收**。这在法国尝试过，结果导致 2000 亿欧元的净资产流出，整体税收反而下降了。他们之所以叫它“亿万富翁税”，是为了让人们更容易投票支持，但其核心是建立一个允许政府审计你拥有的一切并每年拿走一部分的系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: I want to be really clear on this. Forget the term billionaire. Forget the term wealth. What we are talking about is for the first time a tax on individual people's private property not on your income. So the way taxes work today is when you earn income either via labor so you collect a paycheck or via the sale of an asset. You are earning income and you pay a tax on that income. So for the first time ever we are talking about placing a tax on people's private property that hasn't turned into cash. For example, you own some real estate. After you pay your taxes, the government comes and says, "Hey, how much money do you have in your bank account? What's the value of your car? What's the value of the thing that your grandma gave you? Give me the value of everything you have in your house. Add it all up and give me a percentage of it." That's what this is. It's a private property seizure. It is a seizure of your assets to pay a tax based on all the things you own, even if you've already paid your taxes on all those things.

</details>

### 医疗体系辩论

**Jason**: 我一直在思考，为什么我们会走到“亿万富翁税”这一步？根本原因在于，人们在这个国家的医疗和住房方面感到不安全。正如我们的嘉宾刚才所说：“我的朋友中没有一个买得起房。”美国没有**全民医保**简直是奇耻大辱。世界上有 80 个国家都有。我们是世界第二大经济体，是自由世界的领导者。我们如此两极分化，以至于无法解决全民医保这样简单基础的问题，这才是万恶之源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I always like to think why or how did we get to this billionaire's tax? And I think the fundamental issue is that people really don't feel safe in this country when it comes to healthcare and housing. We heard that come up with our guest earlier. He said, "None of my friends have a home." But just looking at healthare, the fact that the United States does not have universal healthcare is complete disgrace. There are 80 countries in the world that have it. We are the second biggest economy in the world. We are the leader of the free world still to this day. The fact that we are so polarized as a country and we have so much fraud as a country that we can't solve something as simple and basic as universal healthcare that is the root of this evil.

</details>

**Sacks**: 问题的关键在于，政府介入医疗越多，医疗就越贵。看看那个图表，凡是市场力量最强的地方（如科技行业），质量在不断提升，价格在不断下降。而政府控制的红线部分，正是欺诈、腐败和成本失控的地方。解决方案是引入**市场力量**和竞争，让政府退出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sacks**: The problem is the more the government gets involved in healthcare the more expensive it gets. And the same thing for college tuition and every other category. Well I mean look you got to have market forces. That's what that chart shows is that where you have the most market forces, which is technology, that's where you have continual quality improvements and price decreases. And while that's happening, the people who create the red lines, basically the people who create this out of control fraud and corruption and cost problem, they're the ones attacking the people who create the blue lines.

</details>

### Groq 胜利时刻

**Jason**: 好了，最后我们要为好基友 **Chamath** 举行一个胜利巡游。本周，**Nvidia** 达成了一项授权协议，授权使用 **Groq** 的技术用于推理芯片。Chamath 是这家公司近十年的支持者，曾多次出手救助。这是一个极其艰难的非共识赌注。你在 **ChatGPT** 问世前五六年就投资了 Groq。恭喜你，Chamath。请给我们讲讲背后的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Anyway, we have one thing we need to get to here on the docket, which is a victory lap for our bestie, Chamath Palihapitiya. This week, Nvidia entered into a licensing agreement to uh license Groq's technology for inference chips. Chamath was the backer of this company for close to a decade and um had to come rescue it a couple of times. It was a brutal non-consensus bet. Uh you invested in Groq essentially formed the company with your partners 5 years, 6 years before chat GPT even debuted. So this was a visionary thing to do and it was a hard bet and so congratulations from one Bessie to another on uh this incredible non-consensus bet you made Chamath but maybe take us through a little bit of the backstory.

**Chamath**: 我们在 10 年前就开始了这项业务。在 **LLM**（大语言模型）的世界里，有两个术语你会经常听到：**Prefill**（预填充）和 **Decode**（解码）。当你在 AI 中输入提示词时，模型会先处理它，这叫读取阶段或 Prefill。它一次性读取整个提示词并进行大量数学计算。这个问题是计算密集型的（Compute bound），Nvidia 的 **GPU** 架构设计非常擅长这种大规模并行处理。但下一阶段，即 Decode 阶段，是写入阶段。模型开始生成响应，一次生成一个 **Token**（标记），为了选择下一个词，它必须回顾之前说过的所有内容，以免产生幻觉。

**Chamath**: We started the business 10 years ago. And so in a world of kind of these LLMs, there's two terms that I think you're going to hear a ton about over these next few years. The first term is prefill and the next is decode. What prefill and decode are is two very distinct ways of how models think and how a model goes through the process of answering a question that you ask it. And so when you send a prompt to AI, what happens is that the model processes it. This is called the reading phase or prefill. It reads your entire prompt all at once and then it does a bunch of math. The problem is that this is really compute bound. So it requires massive brute force and NVIDIA GPUs crush you and their architecture is designed for massive parallel processing. But the next phase though, this critical phase, the decode phase is the writing phase, right? So the model starts to generate a response. You ask it a question and its response one token at a time and then to pick the next token to pick the next word it has to look back at everything it has already said so that it doesn't hallucinate.

**Chamath**: 这个问题是极度受限于**内存带宽**的。我们在很久以前就做出了架构决策。我们使用了很多 **SRAM**（静态随机存取存储器），即芯片上的内存，这样我们做 Decode 的速度比任何人都快。大约一个月前，我和 **Jensen Huang**（黄仁勋）在周六通了电话，他说：“我觉得这东西是真的。”Jensen 对这个行业的洞察力是我在其他行业从未见过的，除了 **Elon**。这是一种大师级的掌控力。如果成功，我们将成为 Nvidia 用来让 AI 更便宜、更普及的基础层。

**Chamath**: The problem is that this is incredibly memory bandwidth constrained. And in our architecture a long time ago, we made these design decisions from day one. We used a lot of what's called SRAM, so memory on the chip so that we could do this decode thing as well or better than everybody else. And then about a month ago, he and I had a call on a Saturday and he's like, "I think this thing is really real." He is operating at a level of insight about what's happening in this industry that I've really never seen with other folks in other industries other than Elon in his industries. It's a level of mastery and a level of skill that is really impressive. I think what will happen here is if successful we will be a foundational layer that Nvidia can use to again make AI much more accessible, much cheaper, much more beneficial to everybody.
