title: 美联储主席遭刑事调查：特朗普政府的政治冒险及其后果
summary: 本文探讨了美国总统特朗普指示司法部对美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔展开刑事调查的事件。调查源于对美联储总部翻新项目成本超支的质疑，但被广泛视为特朗普试图干预货币政策、压低利率的政治手段。此举引发了共和党内部及金融界的强烈反对，损害了美联储的独立性声誉，并可能适得其反，阻碍了特朗普安插亲信的计划。最终，此事件凸显了美联储独立性在维护经济稳定中的关键作用。

### 调查缘起

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是娜塔莉·基特罗。这是《每日》播客。即使对于一个已经将报复发挥到极致的政府来说，决定对美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔展开刑事调查，也令商界和政界感到震惊。今天，我的同事科尔比·史密斯和格伦·特鲁什将解释这次调查是如何发生的，它引发的恐慌，以及为何它可能反而让美联储主席比以往任何时候都更强大。今天是 1 月 15 日，星期四。

**Natalie Kitro**: From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitro. This is the Daily. Even for an administration that has taken revenge to an extreme, the decision to open a criminal investigation into Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has stunned the worlds of business and politics. Today, my colleagues Colby Smith and Glenn Thrush explain how the investigation came about, the panic it unleashed, and why it might have made the Fed chair stronger than ever. It's Thursday, January 15th.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 格伦，科尔比，欢迎来到节目。很高兴你们能来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Glenn Colby, welcome to the show. It's great to have you here.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: Thank you.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 谢谢。很高兴回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: Thanks. It's good to be back.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 那么，在过去的几个月里，我们一直在追踪总统特朗普和美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔之间这场暗流涌动的冲突。特朗普一直试图推动鲍威尔尽快降低利率，而鲍威尔一直在抵制。而在过去几天里，这场斗争真的进入了一个新的、前所未有的阶段。联邦检察官对鲍威尔展开了刑事调查，这在美国华盛顿引发了一场风暴。你们两位一直在报道这一时刻。格伦，以你作为我们司法部记者的视角，科尔比，作为我们的美联储记者。我想先问你，科尔比，帮助我们了解一下我们究竟是如何从暗流涌动的冲突走到这个极其紧张的时刻的。所以，这一切都围绕着利率。正如你提到的，特朗普一直在关注美联储，认为他们没有像他希望的那样快速降低借贷成本。他们在三次会议上降低了利率，但这还不够。总统面临着来自选民的巨大压力，他们担心负担能力问题，担心高通胀，担心劳动力市场疲软。而这一切都让特朗普觉得美联储需要做得更多。而阻碍这一切的是鲍威尔主席。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: So, for the past several months, we've been tracking this simmering conflict between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump has been trying to push Powell for a while now to lower interest rates as fast as possible, and Powell has been resisting. And then in the past few days really that fight entered a new and unprecedented phase. Federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Powell and that set off a firestorm in Washington. You two have been covering this moment. Glenn from your perch as our Justice Department reporter, Colby as our Fed reporter. And I want to start by asking you, Colby, to help us get up to speed on how exactly we got from simmering conflict to this extremely tense moment. So, it all centers around interest rates. As you mentioned, Trump has been all over the Fed for not lowering borrowing costs as fast as he would like. They've lowered interest rates three times over the course of three meetings, but it hasn't been enough for the president. He is facing a lot of pressure from constituents who are worried about affordability issues, are worried about high inflation, about a weakening labor market. And all of this is making Trump feel like the Fed needs to be doing more. And standing in the way of that is Chair Powell.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 对。我们看到特朗普对鲍威尔施加了巨大的个人压力。他威胁要解雇他。他给他起了绰号。而这一切似乎并没有对让鲍威尔在利率问题上让步产生多少影响，甚至可以说毫无影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: Right. We've seen Trump put a ton of pressure on Powell personally. He's threatened to fire him. He's called him names. And all of that has really not done all that much, if anything, it seems, to make Powell move on interest rates.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 是的。但到了夏天，他找到了一个新的角度。他关注的是美联储华盛顿总部正在进行的翻新项目。这个项目出现了巨大的成本超支。这个项目超支了大约 7 亿美元，总成本看起来将达到 25 亿美元左右。特朗普看到这一点后，便抓住机会攻击鲍威尔，说这位美联储主席一定是个无能之辈，管理不善这个项目，或者这里可能存在欺诈。好吧。我读了很多关于这次翻修的文章，它确实听起来非常昂贵，而且远超预算，但我们有任何迹象表明这里有任何犯罪行为吗？有欺诈吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: That's right. But then over the summer, he found a new angle. And what he focused on was this renovation project that was happening at the Fed's headquarters in Washington. There had been massive cost overruns. This thing was running about $700 million over budget, and it was looking like it was going to cost somewhere in the ballpark of $2.5 billion. And when Trump saw this, he seized on it and used it to go after Powell and say this Fed chair must be incompetent and mismanaging this project or maybe something like fraud was happening here. Okay. So, I've read a lot about this renovation and it does sound like it was extremely costly and did go way over budget, but do we have any indication that there was anything criminal here? There was fraud.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 嗯，这确实很昂贵。我的意思是，25 亿美元用于一栋建筑可不是小事。我们确实知道的是，成本超支了大约 7 亿美元左右。所以，显然这个项目有点失控了。我认为重要的背景是，这些建筑已经有 100 年历史了。它们以前从未进行过全面的翻新。有很多工作要做，以维护原始特色。嗯，而且他们还面临着材料和劳动力成本的上涨。但我想重要的是要注意，成本超支不是犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: So, it's certainly expensive. I mean, $2.5 billion for a building is no laughing matter. And what we do know is that the costs were running about 700 million over budget or so. So, clearly the project had gone a little bit awry here. I think what's important context though is that these are 100-year-old buildings. They've never been comprehensively renovated before. There was a lot of work to be done to kind of maintain the original features. Um, and they also were dealing with higher costs for materials and labor. But I think it's important to note that cost overruns, they're not a crime.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 但你说特朗普在这些成本超支中看到了一个可以获得对鲍威尔施压的机会。格伦，从你对司法部的报道来看，请解释一下白宫是如何将调查作为下一步行动的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: But you're saying that Trump sees in these cost overruns an opportunity to gain leverage over Powell. Glenn, from your reporting on the Justice Department, just explain how the White House lands on an investigation as the next move here.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 因为司法部已经成为白宫实现报复或恐吓政治对手的主要渠道。特朗普身边有很多听他想听的话的人。其中最主要的是一个叫比尔·派（Bill Py）的人。大多数人没听说过他，因为他经营着一个相对不起眼的机构。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: because the Justice Department has become for the White House its principal conduit for achieving retribution or intimidating political adversaries. And Trump has a lot of people in his orbit telling him things that he wants to hear. Chief among them is a guy by the name of Bill Py. Most people haven't heard of him because he runs a relatively obscure agency.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 是的。解释一下他是谁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Yeah. Explain who he is.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 他是一位前房地产开发商，他经营着一个负责住房金融的机构，这似乎是一个相当温和且无争议的职位。这个人一直在敦促特朗普去追查他的一些敌人，涉及抵押贷款欺诈。纽约州总检察长莱蒂西亚·詹姆斯（Leticia James），加利福尼亚州参议员亚当·希夫（Adam Schiff），他一直是特朗普的眼中钉。最近，他一直在敦促特朗普利用这次翻新来对付鲍威尔。你说的是，提出这个建议的人，这位官员比尔·派，对我们许多人来说可能很陌生，但实际上在特朗普的圈子里，他已经将自己塑造成了一个非官方的首席报复官。他正在策划许多针对特朗普希望看到受到惩罚的人物进行打击的行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: He's a former real estate developer and he runs the agency that deals with housing finance, which seems like a pretty benign and non-controversial post. This is a guy who's been pushing Trump to go after a couple of his enemies on mortgage fraud. Leticia James, the New York State Attorney General, Adam Schiff, the senator from California, who has been a burr under Trump's saddle, and recently he's been pushing Trump to use this renovation as a way to go after Powell. And what you're saying is the guy who is suggesting this, this official Bill Py, he may seem obscure to many of us, but actually within Trump's orbit, he's kind of distinguished himself as something like an unofficial chief retribution officer. He's engineering many of these pushes to go after figures that Trump wants to see punished.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 然而，这次的不同之处在于，这并非针对某个敌人。这是为了政治结果施加筹码，并追求特朗普的目标，即在经济数据不佳时，获得对美联储和经济政策的更多控制。所以派一直在特朗普耳边说，这是有可能的，可以对鲍威尔采取行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: What makes this one different, however, is this isn't about going after an enemy. This is about applying leverage for political result and to pursue Trump's goal to gain more control over the Fed uh and economic policy at a time uh when his approval ratings on the economy are in the tank. So PY has been in Trump's ear telling him that this is a possibility that something could really be done against Powell.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 当然，我们现在知道他们确实对鲍威尔采取了行动。那么，请告诉我这一切是如何发生的。到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: which of course we now know they did take action against Powell. So tell me about how this all came about. What exactly happened?

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 所以，杰宁·皮罗（Janine Piro）登场了。她是华盛顿特区美国检察官。她有权管辖美联储总部。所以这在她管辖范围内。皮罗显然与唐纳德·特朗普关系密切，长达数十年。她是前威斯特彻斯特地区检察官。她曾是福克斯电视台主持人。她经常与特朗普交谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: So enter Janine Piro. She is the US attorney for Washington DC, the District of Columbia. And she is the person who has jurisdiction over the Fed headquarters. So this is in her territory. Piro is obviously somebody who has been close to Donald Trump for a long time, decades really. She is the former Westchester District Attorney. She's a former Fox host. She is somebody who talks to Trump constantly.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 在秋季的某个时候，我们认为大约是 11 月，她开始阅读新闻报道，包括《纽约邮报》的一篇报道，这让她感触很深，于是她决定指派她办公室里的几名检察官开始对鲍威尔的活动进行初步调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: pro at some point in the fall, we think around November, starts reading press accounts, including one in the New York Post that really hits home for her, and she decides to assign a couple of prosecutors in her office to begin a preliminary inquiry into Powell's activities.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 她在读新闻报道，说清楚点，她在读关于这次翻新以及它很昂贵的新闻报道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: She's reading press stories, to be clear, she's reading press stories that are talking about this renovation and the fact that it is costly.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 是的。而且是来自特朗普友好媒体的报道，这些报道强调了鲍威尔可能卷入不法行为。这激励了她，她开始采取行动。据我们所知，一开始进展很慢，但到了 12 月，事情开始真正加速，皮罗的办公室向美联储发了两封信，要求提供信息。我们没有这些信件的副本，但它们被描述给了我们。一位皮罗的助手说，这些是她办公室发给任何人的最礼貌的信件之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: Yeah. and really press stories from Trump friendly news outlets that are emphasizing the potential culpability of Powell in something nefarious. So this motivates her and she starts moving forward. Our sense is that this started off pretty slowly, but by December this starts to really pick up and Piro's office sends the Fed two letters requesting information. Now, we don't have copies of these letters, but they've been described to us. And one PIO associate said these were among the most polite letters her office ever sent to anyone.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 科尔比，美联储也有这种感觉吗？比如，这些信件是如何被接收的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Colby, is that sense shared within the Fed? Like, how were these letters received?

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 这些被视为，你知道，随意的接触。我的意思是，几乎是轻描淡写。绝不是会导致刑事调查，而且是迫在眉睫的调查。信中没有提到调查，没有提到传票，甚至没有设定回复的最后期限。它们是在假期期间发送的。大约在 12 月 19 日，然后第二封邮件在 12 月 29 日发出。在回复方面没有真正的紧迫感。所以美联储按兵不动。他们没有回复这些信件，他们也从未预料到接下来会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: These were seen as, you know, casual outreach. I mean, breezy almost in a way. Nothing of the sort that would lead to a criminal investigation and an imminent one at that. There was no mention of an investigation, no mention of subpoenas, no deadline even for a response. They were over the holiday period. It was around December 19th and then the second email came on December 29th. And there was no real sense of kind of urgency in terms of a response. And so the Fed sits tight. They don't respond to those letters and they never expected what would happen next.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 好的，我明白了，这些信件是在一个比较冷清的假期周发送的，而且没有设定最后期限，但这些是检察官在索取信息，对吧？为什么美联储没有回应？我们知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Okay, I get that these letters landed during a kind of dead holiday week and they didn't come with a deadline, but these were prosecutors asking for information, right? Like why didn't the Fed respond? Do we know?

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 我认为我们对他们回应的细节有很多不了解的地方，但我认为很清楚的是，特别是关于这些翻新项目，美联储不得不提供很多解释，而且自去年 7 月这场争议爆发以来，他们已经提供了大量信息。那是去年 7 月，当时这个项目受到了如此多的审视，这是一个耗资 25 亿美元、历时多年的庞大工程，吸引了如此多的关注，以至于总统本人都前来参观了施工现场，并就项目的真实成本与鲍威尔主席公开争论。所以这是他们不得不回答无数议员关于成本超支性质以及项目具体计划的问题。因此，我认为在很多方面，人们的看法是，关于这些翻新项目已经有很多信息了，而且他们认为这不需要立即回应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: So, I think there's a lot we don't know about the like ins and outs of their responses here, but I think what's been clear, especially about these renovations, is that this is something that the Fed has had to provide a lot of answers for, and they've provided a ton of information since this whole controversy broke out back in July. That was a time when there was so much scrutiny over this project, which is a two and a half billion dollar sprawling multi-year undertaking that had drawn so much attention that even the president came and visited the active construction site and openly sparred with Chair Powell over the true cost of the project. So this is something that they had answered countless lawmaker questions about, not only about the nature of the cost overruns, but what the specific plans around the project were going to be. So I think in a lot of ways the perception was there's a lot of information already out there about these renovations and I don't think that they thought that this required an immediate response.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 明白了。所以，他们没有回应这些信件，可能是因为鲍威尔基本上在说，“我们已经很坦诚了，我们没有做错任何事。”那么，格伦，告诉我，我们是如何从这些显然非常礼貌的信件走到刑事传票这一步的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Got it. So, the lack of response to these letters may have been because Powell is basically saying, "We have been forthcoming and we haven't done anything wrong." So, Glenn, tell me, how do we get from these apparently very polite letters to a criminal subpoena?

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 正是在这里，这与特朗普正在升级的针对他自己司法部的施压运动发生了碰撞。几天前，特朗普与全国各地数十名美国检察官举行了一次非常有趣的闭门会议，其中包括杰宁·皮罗。特朗普对他们大发雷词，称他们软弱，指责他们没有足够积极地推行他的报复议程。就在几天后，皮罗决定对美联储采取强硬手段。然后在周日晚上，我们爆出了皮罗对美联储展开刑事调查的消息。然后鲍威尔出来说，他的办公室在周五收到了传票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: It's right here that this collides with the pressure campaign that Trump is ramping up against his own justice department. A couple of days earlier, very interesting closed-door meeting between Trump and dozens and dozens of US attorneys from around the country, including Janine Piro. Trump lashes out at them, calls them weak, accuses them of not aggressively enough pursuing his retribution agenda. And it is just a couple of days later that Piro makes the decision to start playing hard ball with the Fed. And then on Sunday night, we break the story that Piro initiated a criminal investigation into the Fed. And then Powell comes out and says his office got subpoenas on Friday.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 鲍威尔这样做的方式是非同寻常的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And the way Powell did that was extraordinary.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 晚上好。周五，司法部向美联储发出大陪审团传票，威胁要进行刑事调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: Good evening. On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 在我们周日晚上爆出消息后不久，美联储发布了一段两分钟的视频。视频中是鲍威尔独自站在讲台前宣读声明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Shortly after we broke the story on Sunday night, the Fed released a two-minute video. It featured Powell standing alone in front of a lectern reading a statement.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 这种前所未有的行动应该放在政府威胁和持续施压的更广泛背景下看待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 这基本上是针对总统的法律威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And it basically called out the president for these legal threats.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 这种新的威胁不是关于我去年 6 月的证词，也不是关于美联储大楼的翻新。他明确表示，所有这些与翻新有关的法律威胁，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. and he made clear that all of these legal threats related to the renovation,

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 都只是借口，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: those are pretexts,

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 都是为了向中央银行施压，要求其降低利率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: were nothing more than pretexts to put pressure on the central bank to lower interest rates.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 这是关于美联储是否能够继续根据证据和经济状况来设定利率，还是说货币政策将由政治压力或恐吓来指导。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 科尔比，你长期以来一直在报道美联储和鲍威尔主席。所以请向我解释一下，为什么这段视频如此非同寻常？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And Colby, you've been covering the Fed and Chair Powell for a very long time. So just explain for me why this video was so extraordinary.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 我们以前从未见过鲍威尔直接回应总统的任何行为。现在，他的做法是，鲍威尔似乎在回避总统扔给他的各种攻击。任何时候总统侮辱他，威胁要解雇他或让他辞职，鲍威尔基本上都无视了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: So we hadn't really seen Powell directly respond to anything the president has really done. Now what that has looked like is Powell kind of brushing aside all of the various attacks that the president has thrown his way. Anytime he's insulted him, anytime he's threatened to fire him or tell him to resign, Powell has pretty much ignored that.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 我在四个政府任期内都在美联储任职。包括共和党和民主党。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations. Republicans and Democrats alike.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 但这次不同。这不是一次言语攻击。我认为主席认为他可以忽略这一点。我认为当时的考え是，这是一个站出来有力地表达美联储独立性的时刻，并表明，你知道，美联储不再会被随意摆布了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: But this was different. This was not a rhetorical attack. This was not something that I think the chair thought that he could ignore. I think the thinking there was that this was a moment to step up and say something strong about Fed independence and to show that, you know, the Fed was not going to be pushed around any longer.

</details>

**鲍威尔 (Jerome Powell)**: 公共服务有时需要顶住威胁，坚定不移。我将继续以诚信和致力于服务美国人民的精神，履行参议院赋予我的职责。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jerome Powell**: Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people. Thank you.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 而一旦这段视频发布，我们听到鲍威尔说出这些话，一切都改变了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And once that video goes out and we hear Powell say those words out loud, everything changes.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 好的。所以，鲍威尔发布了这份声明，它真的改变了动态。怎么改变的？请详细说明。发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Okay. So, Powell comes out with this statement and it really changes the dynamic. How? Walk me through that. What happens?

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 我们看到共和党人和特朗普的盟友们普遍出现了强烈反对，这是在宣布调查和起诉后我们从未见过的。这次完全不同。最先发声的是汤姆·蒂利斯（Tom Tillis）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: We see a backlash from Republicans and Trump allies across the board that we had not seen after the announcement of investigations and prosecutions. This is totally different. The first person out of the gate was Tom Tillis.

</details>

**汤姆·蒂利斯 (Tom Tillis)**: 我的意思是，总统说他没有参与其中。在我看来，这是业余时间的又一个例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tom Tillis**: I mean, the president said he wasn't in the mix. Another example of amateur hour as far as I'm concerned.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 你认为他是一位来自北卡罗来纳州的温和派共和党人？他没有竞选连任。那些人总是在华盛顿声音最大。他站出来说：“特朗普总统，无论你派谁去接替鲍威尔，如果你继续走这条起诉之路，我甚至都不会投票。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Do you think he's a kind of a moderate Republican from North Carolina? He's not running for reelection. Those are always the people who speak loudest in Washington. And he comes out and he says, "President Trump, whoever you send up to the hill to replace Powell, I'm not even going to vote on if you continue down this road on this prosecution."

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 那么，他们应该撤销调查吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: So, should they drop the investigation?

</details>

**汤姆·蒂利斯 (Tom Tillis)**: 我不会介入这件事。在调查结束之前，我不会考虑任何委员会的确认。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tom Tillis**: I'm not going to get into that. What I'm going to do is drop any consideration for any board confirmation until it's done.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 这以前从未发生过。然后在接下来的几个小时，甚至在接下来的 36 小时里，我们看到了这种批评的浪潮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: That just hasn't happened before. And then in the succeeding hours and and really over the next 36 hours, we just saw this cascade of criticism.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 我会震惊，如果他做了任何错事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: I will be shocked if he has done anything wrong.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 来自特朗普不习惯听到批评的地方。福克斯新闻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: from places Trump isn't used to seeing criticism from. Fox News.

</details>

**福克斯新闻评论员 (Fox News Commentator)**: 嗯，我不确定这次调查会 going anywhere。我非常怀疑杰罗姆·鲍威尔是否故意向国会撒谎。他可能在他所说的话中有所失误，但我认为他是一个正直的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Fox News Commentator**: Well, I'm not sure this investigation will ever go anywhere. I doubt very seriously that Jerome Powell lied to Congress in any intentional way. He may have been mistaken in something that he said, but I think he's an honorable man.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 而且拉里·库德洛（Larry Kudlow），他曾是糟糕的美联储主席，但他不是罪犯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: And Larry Kudlow, he was a terrible Fed chair, but he's not a criminal.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 他是特朗普第一任期内的主要经济顾问之一，也是特朗普经常在电视上观看的人，他说这是一个愚蠢的想法。参议院的其他成员，包括多数党领袖约翰·图恩（John Thune）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: one of his top economic adviserss during the first term and somebody Trump watches on TV all the time said this was a stupid idea and other members of the Senate including John Thoon the majority leader.

</details>

**约翰·图恩 (John Thune)**: 如果司法部正在进行调查，我希望他们有确凿的证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Thune**: if the justice department is pursuing something I hope they have a smoking gun.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 对此事表示极度怀疑，并表示他们需要看到鲍威尔犯下罪行的确凿证据，才能获得他们的批准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: expressed extreme skepticism about this and said that they needed to see real evidence that Powell had committed criminality for this thing to go forward with their approval.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 好的。所以，我理解鲍威尔在国会中很受信任，但格伦，我们知道共和党人一直很愿意接受特朗普的许多做法，包括许多报复行动，甚至在此之前对美联储的许多攻击。那么，为什么他们这次如此有力地与他决裂呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Okay. So, I understand that Powell is, you're saying, very trusted among many people on the Hill, but Glenn, we know that Republicans have been very willing to go along with a lot from Trump, a lot of retribution efforts, even a lot of attacks on the Fed before this. So, why do they break with him on this so forcefully?

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 不到 6 个月，中期选举就将全面展开。没有什么比可能失去工作的前景更能让共和党人发出更大的声音并挑战他们自己的总统了。任何威胁到经济稳定或经济的事情，他们都会反击。这正是我们所看到的。而且我认为同样重要的是要注意，没有什么比认为中央银行不独立更能动摇金融市场了。值得注意的是，我们没有看到更大的市场反应。我认为一些人预计，在这一切之后，这将是一个巨大的时刻。但很多人告诉我，许多共和党议员站出来说他们不支持这种性质的攻击，这确实帮助缓解了人们对美联储突然屈服、不再独立行事的担忧。但再说一遍，我认为这些议员关注的不仅仅是经济。他们真正关注的是华尔街，我们知道华尔街是衡量总统成功与否的晴雨表。请快速说明一下，为什么华尔街会对美联储独立性受到威胁的表象做出如此强烈的反应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: In less than 6 months, the midterm elections are going to hit full swing. And there is nothing that makes Republicans speak up louder and challenge their own president than the potential prospect of losing their jobs. And anything that threatens the potential stability or the economy, they are going to fight back. And that's exactly what we're seeing. And I also think it's important to note that nothing's going to rattle financial markets more than thinking that the central bank is an independent. And it's been notable that we haven't seen more of a market reaction. I think some people were expecting in the aftermath of this that this would be a seismic moment. But a lot of what I hear is that having so many Republican lawmakers come out and say that they don't stand by attacks of this nature has has really helped to alleviate fears that the Fed isn't suddenly going to fold here and no longer act independently. But again, I mean, it's not just the economy that I think these lawmakers are focused on. It's really Wall Street, which we know is a barometer of success for the president. and just say quickly why it is that Wall Street will react so strongly to the appearance that the Fed's independence is really being threatened.

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 嗯，金融体系的稳定很大程度上取决于我们有一个致力于追求低通胀和健康劳动力市场的中央银行。如果这一点发生了变化，那么我认为人们对美国金融体系的假设就会开始改变。正是这种独立性增强了人们对美元和美国国债的信心。所以，如果你颠倒剧本，谈论美联储的独立性，那么人们对美国经济及其金融体系的稳定性的看法就会真的改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: Well, so much of the stability of the financial system rests on the fact that we have a central bank that wants to pursue low stable inflation and a healthy labor market. And if that has changed, then I think people's assumptions about the financial system in the US start to change. That independence is what bolsters people's confidence in the dollar in US treasuries. And so if you flip the script on Fed independence, then it really starts to change people's perspective of just how stable is the US economy and its financial system.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 另一种思考方式是，这就像拔掉了你不能承受的那一根积木。这不是共和党人想要的。这不会增加稳定性。你看，当司法部去追查詹姆斯·科米或蒂什·詹姆斯时，它会损害法治的基本问题，但你知道，它不会危及整体经济。这是国会上的共和党人无法容忍的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Another way to think about this is this is like pulling out the one Jenga piece you cannot afford to pull out. This is not something that Republicans want. It's not something that adds to stability. Look, when the Justice Department goes after James Comey or Tish James, it compromises fundamental issues of of rule of law, but you know, it doesn't imperil the overall economy. That's something Republicans on the Hill cannot abide.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 特朗普白宫对此罕见的异议表现出怎样的回应？比如，皮罗是否认为她的行为是个错误？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And what has the Trump White House response to this rare showing of dissent been? Like, does Piro, for example, see her actions as a mistake?

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 杰宁·皮罗对此事的反应非常有趣。当出现强烈反对时，而且几乎是瞬间发生的。皮罗的回应是淡化这次调查的严重性。她基本上说，是缺乏回应促成了此事，调查远未到起诉的地步。皮罗淡化了此事可能导致起诉的可能性。所以，她做了一些在特朗普时代你几乎从未见过司法部人员做的事情，那就是稍微收回一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: Janine Piro's reaction to this has been really interesting. When the blowback happened, and it was pretty much instantaneous. Piro responded by downplaying the seriousness of this investigation. She essentially said that the lack of response is what precipitated this, that an investigation is far from being a prosecution. Piro has downplayed the likelihood that this will result in prosecutions. So, she did something that you almost never see Justice Department people do in the Trump era, and that is walk it back ever so slightly.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 但她是一个试图平衡取悦老板的愿望，同时保持自己作为一名受事实而非政治驱动的公正检察官的形象的人。而且谁知道呢，虽然国会上的共和党人和国际货币界可能认为皮罗做得太过分了，但特朗普在某种程度上很可能认为她完成了他想要完成的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: but she's somebody who is attempting to balance her desire to please the boss with maintaining some semblance of her own image as an impartial prosecutor motivated by facts rather than politics. And who knows, while the Republicans on the Hill and the international monetary community might think Piro has gone way overboard, Trump to some extent is quite likely to see this as her executing something that he wanted accomplished.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 我们是否了解特朗普是如何看待这件事的？他的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And do we have an understanding of how Trump is perceiving this? What's his reaction been?

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 特朗普不一定是在退缩。他试图与调查保持一些距离。他说他对此一无所知，但他肯定没有抓住机会，你知道，改变他对鲍威尔的口吻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: So Trump is not necessarily like backing away from this. He tried to create some distance between himself and the investigation. and he said he didn't know anything about it, but he's certainly not taking the opportunity to, you know, shift his tone as it relates to Powell.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 他超支了数十亿美元，所以他要么是无能，要么是腐败。我不知道他是哪种，但他肯定做得不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: He's billions of dollars over budget, so he either is incompetent or he's crooked. I don't know what he is, but he doesn't certainly doesn't do a very good job.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 最近，他，你知道，骂他是混蛋，说这其实没多大关系，因为他很快就会下台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Recently, he, you know, called him a jerk and said that it didn't really matter much because he'd be out soon.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 上周，30 年期抵押贷款利率首次跌破 6%，这是多年来的第一次。它在迅速下降，而且不是在美联储的帮助下。如果得到美联储的帮助，会更容易，但那个混蛋很快就会下台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Last week, the average 30-year mortgage up below 6% for the first time in many years. It's coming down very rapidly and that's not with the help of the Fed. If I had the help of the Fed, it would be easier, but that jerk will be gone soon.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 指的是鲍威尔的任期将于 5 月份到期。但我们确实知道的是，在政府内部，情况有点复杂。财政部长史蒂文·姆努钦（Steven Mnuchin），他负责寻找鲍威尔的继任者，完全不赞成这个决定。他发现调查正在进行时，直接给总统打了电话，表达了他的沮丧，并告诉总统这可能会阻碍他们确认新任美联储主席的计划。这是真的吗，科尔比？这会影响政府提名鲍威尔的继任者吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Referencing the fact that Powell's term is up in May. But what we do know is that inside the administration, it's a bit more complicated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, who's leading the process to find Powell's replacement as chair, was not on board with this decision at all. He called the president directly when he found out the investigation was moving forward and you know expressed his frustration and told the president that this could impede their plans to confirm a new chair for the Fed. And is that true Colby? Like could this actually impact the administration's ability to nominate Powell's replacement?

</details>

**科尔比·史密斯 (Colby Smith)**: 是的，这可能是一个巨大的障碍。我的意思是，正如格伦早些时候提到的，是参议员蒂利斯站出来说，你知道，我不会支持批准或推进政府为这个主席职位提出的任何提名。这对参议院银行委员会来说是个大问题，因为他们负责审查、质询，然后投票决定谁可以提交给参议院全体进行投票。如果他们失去了蒂利斯的支持，就可能导致投票僵局。所以，整个美联储提名过程很容易被搞砸。其次，鲍威尔主席有可能在之后继续担任理事。他的主席任期将于 5 月结束，但他理论上可以留任中央银行直到 2028 年，届时他的理事任期将届满。这很重要，因为特朗普真正想做的是让尽可能多的他的支持者进入美联储。如果鲍威尔不离开，那就堵塞了一个特朗普本可以任命他想任用的人的职位空缺。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colby Smith**: Yeah, this could be a big impediment. I mean, as Glenn mentioned earlier, it was Senator Tillis who kind of raised his hand and said, you know, I'm not going to be on board with approving or moving along any of the nominations that the administration is putting forward for this chair position. And that's a big problem because he's on the Senate Banking Committee and they are responsible for vetting and questioning and then voting on who proceeds to the full Senate for a vote. And if they lose Tillis, that could result in a deadlocked vote. So, it could very easily be the case that the whole Fed nomination process gets thrown off the rails. Second to that, it's very possible that Chair Powell decides to stay on as a governor after this point. His term as chair is up in May, but he technically can stay on at the central bank until 2028 when his term as a governor expires. Now, this is important because what Trump really wants to do is to put as many of his supporters at the Fed as possible. And if Powell doesn't leave, that blocks another vacancy that Trump would have had to put forward someone that he wanted in that position.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 我们可以停下来思考一下吗？你刚才说的基本上是，这个针对鲍威尔的戏剧性举动可能让他更难让自己的亲信担任央行行长，而且还可能促使鲍威尔在银行继续担任有投票权的职务，时间比特朗普可能希望的要长。这里的悖论是，特朗普试图通过声称对这些机构拥有主导权，可能已经失去了对美国经济的很大一部分控制权。他的影响力可能已经超出了他的掌控范围。我知道我们经常在很多场合说这句话，但特朗普离他第二个也是最后一个跛脚鸭任期已经不远了。他可能有点用力过猛了。他以前能够随心所欲地对待司法部，直到最近，他也能随心所欲地对待国会上的共和党人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Can we just pause and cogitate for a second on that? Like what you just said is essentially that this dramatic move against Powell may have both made it much harder for Trump to put his own person in as the head of the central bank and it also may prompt Powell to stay on at the bank in a voting capacity for a while longer than Trump probably wants. The paradox here is Trump may have lost a significant amount of his authority over the American economy by trying to assert dominance over these institutions. His reach might very well have exceeded his grasp. I know we say this a lot in a lot of context, but but Trump is, you know, not too far from the second half of his second and lame duck term here. And he may have pushed this a bit too far. He's been able to have his way with the Justice Department. He's been able to have his way with Republicans on Congress until fairly recently.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 他似乎可以毫不费力地从委内瑞拉带走一位独裁者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: He can extract a dictator from Venezuela, it seems, without much resistance.

</details>

**格伦·特鲁什 (Glenn Thrush)**: 确切地说是。确切地说是。但这是一个支持率只有 40% 的人，他的权威是有限的。而且他在这里触及的是那些在 20 世纪初建立起来的制度优势，这些制度是为了抵御这种行政权力掠夺而建立的。这可能是一个真正的时刻，可能是特朗普控制经济的最高点。这是总统们倾向于犯的错误。我们倾向于认为唐纳德·特朗普完全脱离了历史的洪流。但总统们通常在他们的第二个任期内，尤其是在他们认为自己被验证的选举之后，往往会追求他们没有政治支持来实现的目标。时间会告诉我们这是否是其中一个例子。但初步迹象表明，唐纳德·特朗普可能给自己惹上了麻烦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Glenn Thrush**: Exa Exactly. Exactly. But this is a guy who's got a 40% approval rating and there are limits to his authority. And what he's also hitting here are the institutional strengths that were created, this bull work in the Federal Reserve in the early 20th century that were intended to withstand precisely this kind of an executive power grab. And this might be a real moment, potentially a high watermark in terms of Trump's control over the economy. This is the kind of mistake that presidents tend to make. We tend to think of Donald Trump as being completely outside of the stream of history. But presidents typically in their second terms often times after an election that they believe validated them tend to uh reach for goals that they do not have the political support to achieve. Time will tell if this is one of those instances. But the early indications are Donald Trump may have gotten himself into some trouble here.

</details>

**主持人 (Natalie Kitro)**: 那么，对于鲍威尔、科尔比和美联储来说，这一切的教训是什么？这个以其谨慎的言辞和避免党派行为而自豪的机构，现在却有力地为自己辩护，而且似乎奏效了。那么结果是什么？我认为结果是，美联储在过去一年里一直保持沉默和不对抗，我认为他们积累了很多尊重和好感。所以当总统采取了过于激进的一步，以一种许多人认为过火的方式攻击这个机构时，当他们最终做出回应时，每个人都竖起了耳朵。我认为现在我们正在进入一个新的时代，官员们在公开批评总统时感到更加直言不讳。而这反过来，我认为将有助于加强美联储的独立性，而美联储在过去一年左右一直受到无情的攻击。在某种程度上，总统和政府试图削弱美联储，反而使其更加强大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: And for Powell, Colby and the Fed, what is the lesson in all of this? This institution that prides itself on being so careful with its words and so cautious to not engage in any partisan behavior has now come out and defended itself forcefully and it seems to be working. So what's the upshot? I think the upshot here is that the Fed in being so quiet and so non-confrontational in the past year, I think they built up a lot of respect and goodwill. And so when the time came when the president took too aggressive of a step and attacked the institution in a way that so many people thought was a step too far, when they finally did respond, everyone sat up and listened. And I think that now we are entering a new era where officials feel a little bit more forthright in calling out the president for what he is doing. And that in turn I think is going to help to bolster the independence of the Fed which had been under you know relentless attack in the past year or so. And in some ways in trying to weaken the Fed, the president and the administration only made it stronger.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitro**: Okay. So, Pal comes out with this statement and it really changes the dynamic. How? Walk me through that. What happens? We see a backlash from Republicans and Trump allies across the board that we had not seen after the announcement of investigations and prosecutions. This is totally different. The first person out of the gate was Tom Tillis. I mean, the president said he wasn't in the mix. Another example of amateur hour as far as I'm concerned. Do you think he's a kind of a moderate Republican from North Carolina? He's not running for reelection. Those are always the people who speak loudest in Washington. And he comes out and he says, "President Trump, whoever you send up to the hill to replace Powell, I'm not even going to vote on if you continue down this road on this prosecution." So, should they drop the investigation? I'm not going to get into that. What I'm going to do is drop any consideration for any board confirmation until it's done. That just hasn't happened before. And then in the succeeding hours and and really over the next 36 hours, we just saw this cascade of criticism. I will be shocked if he has done anything wrong from places Trump isn't used to seeing criticism from. Fox News. Well, I'm not sure this investigation will ever go anywhere. I doubt very seriously that Jerome Powell lied to Congress in any intentional way. He may have been mistaken in something that he said, but I think he's an honorable man. And Larry Kudlow, he was a terrible Fed chair, but he's not a criminal. one of his top economic adviserss during the first term and somebody Trump watches on TV all the time said this was a stupid idea and other members of the Senate including John Thoon the majority leader if the justice department is pursuing something I hope they have a smoking gun expressed extreme skepticism about this and said that they needed to see real evidence that Powell had committed criminality for this thing to go forward with their approval. Okay. So, I understand that Powell is, you're saying, very trusted among many people on the Hill, but Glenn, we know that Republicans have been very willing to go along with a lot from Trump, a lot of retribution efforts, even a lot of attacks on the Fed before this. So, why do they break with him on this so forcefully? In less than 6 months, the midterm elections are going to hit full swing. And there is nothing that makes Republicans speak up louder and challenge their own president than the potential prospect of losing their jobs.

Here's what else you need to know. Today, we have been we have been informed by very important sources on the other side. They've said the killing is stopped and the executions won't take place. There were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won't take place. On Wednesday, President Trump said that the Iranian government appeared to have stopped killing protesters. Trump had been threatening to attack Iran if the government harmed demonstrators and he didn't say Wednesday whether he was still considering military action. Does this mean military action is now off the table against Iran? and we're going to watch it and see what the process is, but we were given a very good uh very good statement by people that are um aware of what's going on. Iran had announced on Wednesday that it was closing airspace across the country to commercial flights and the US military had evacuated personnel from Qatar amid the tensions. But after Trump's comments, a US military official told the Times that the Pentagon was ready to bring troops back to the base in Qatar, saying the president had given a quote offramp. And Senate Republicans successfully blocked an effort to force President Trump to seek congressional approval for any military action in Venezuela. Last week, it seemed that the measure to curb the president's war powers would come up for a vote after five Republican senators said they would support it. But on Wednesday, after speaking with officials from the Trump administration, two of those senators, Josh Holly of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, flipped their positions and joined the push to kill the measure.
