### 重返火灾遗址

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们现在正驶向过火区的西侧。你仍然可以看到那些翠绿的山脉与被烧焦的山脉之间的鲜明对比。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: So, we're coming up kind of the west side of the burn scar now, but you can also still see the difference between the mountains that are green and the mountains that are burned.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 这位是我的同事，**Michael Cohen**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: This is my colleague, Michael Cohen.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我叫 Michael Bradley Cohen。我是 **Wirecutter** 的交易编辑，那些关注“黑色星期五”报道的读者应该对我比较熟悉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: My name is Michael Bradley Cohen. I am a deals writer at Wirecutter for all of those who follow along over Black Friday.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Michael 平时大家都叫他 Mike。他曾经就住在我们现在正开车经过的这个社区——**阿尔塔迪纳（Altadena）**，就在洛杉矶郊外。整整一年前，也就是 2025 年 1 月 7 日，**帕利塞兹（Palisades）**和**伊顿（Eaton）**山火爆发。它们最终成为了加州历史上最具破坏性的火灾之一，烧毁了 16,000 多座建筑，其中包括阿尔塔迪纳近 6,000 栋房屋。Mike 的家就是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Michael goes by Mike and he used to live in the neighborhood we're driving through right now, Altadena, just outside of LA. Exactly a year ago, on January 7th, 2025, the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted. They would ultimately become among the most destructive in California's history, eventually burning down more than 16,000 structures, including nearly 6,000 homes in Altadena. Mike's home was one of them.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我以前住在阿尔塔迪纳。那是我们买的第一套房子。现在这里的情况已经好多了。即使是沿着林肯大道开上来，以前这里到处都是灰烬和碎片。现在看到草坪恢复了，看到人们回到这里，真的非常令人兴奋。我们现在还只是在过火区的边缘。我们要右转进入阿尔塔迪纳大道，然后往里走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: I lived in Altadena. It was the first home we ever bought. It has gotten so much better already. And even driving up Lincoln, like all of this was covered in ash and debris and everything. Um, and to see all the lawns back and to see like people here is all really, really exciting. Um, again, we're still kind of just skirting the Burnscar. Um, but we'll turn right on Altadena Drive and then we'll head in.

</details>

### 灾难中的 Wirecutter 精神

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我是 Christine Cyr Clisset，这是《Wirecutter Show》。今天的节目是一个三部分系列的第一集。我们将关注统称为“洛杉矶山火”的这场灾难。我们会讨论应急准备背景下的一些具体建议，但我们也会聆听这个故事中感人的一面。我们将与 Mike 以及我们的另一位同事 **Gregory Han** 交流，他经历了伊顿火灾。他们将分享过去一年学到的教训：关于自然灾害的不可预测性，以及恢复之路是多么漫长、艰辛、充满情感且代价高昂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: I'm Christine Cyr Clisset and this is the Wirecutter Show. Today's episode is the first in a three-part series. It's an expansion of what we normally do on this show. We're going to focus on the disaster, collectively known as the LA wildfires. We'll be talking about some specific pieces of advice in the context of emergency preparedness, but we're also going to hear the human side of this story. We'll talk with Mike and another colleague of ours, Gregory Han, who lived through the eaten fire, about the things they've learned over the past year, about the unpredictability of natural disasters and just how long, arduous, emotional, and expensive the road to recovery can be.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们之所以专门制作三集特别节目，是因为坦率地说，有很多东西需要学习。这不仅是为了住在洛杉矶或其他山火高发区的人，也是为了任何可能面临自然灾害并想知道“我该如何准备？”的人。在 Wirecutter，我们提供建议并推荐应对自然灾害的装备。不幸的是，**气候变化**正使这些天气事件变得更加频繁、剧烈且不可预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: We're dedicating three special episodes to this conversation because frankly, there is a lot to learn and not just for people who live in Los Angeles or other wildfire prone areas, but for anyone who might face a natural disaster and wonder, "What can I do to prepare?" At Wirecutter, we offer advice and recommend gear to prepare for natural disasters. Unfortunately, climate change is making these weather events more frequent, more intense, and more unpredictable.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 和 Gregory 经历了这场灾难。因为 Wirecutter 的精神根深蒂固，他们全程都在像真正的 Wirecutter 作者一样思考：关注细节，记录下可以与他人分享的教训。他们总结出的指导建议适用于任何自然灾害，比如你需要了解的**房屋保险**知识，或者你现在就可以对房屋和社区进行的投资，这些投资在紧急情况下带来的回报可能远超你的想象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike and Gregory lived through a disaster. And because the wire cutter ethos runs deep, they were thinking the whole time like true wire cutter writers. People who consider the details, who take notes on the lessons they could share with others. They came through it with guidance that could apply to any natural disaster, like what you need to understand about home insurance in case you ever really need to use it, or the ways you can invest in your home and community now, wherever you live, that may pay off in an emergency a lot more than you think.

</details>

### 在阿尔塔迪纳安家

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们的同事 Gregory Han 主动联系了我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: That's when our colleague Gregory Han reached out.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 我是 Gregory Han。我是 Wirecutter 的撰稿人，也是一名设计作家，合著过三本书。我住在阿尔塔迪纳。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I'm Gregory Han. I am a contributor at Wirecutter, but also a design writer and co-author of three books. The latest with my wife about trees, previously about mushrooms. I live in Altadena.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory 在洛杉矶出生长大。他的房子虽然还在，但被火灾严重污染，他和妻子被迫搬离了数月。我们请他与 Mike 合作，讲述他们在火灾后的共同经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory was born and raised in Los Angeles. His home is still standing, but it was severely polluted by the fire, and so he and his wife were displaced for months. We asked him to work with Mike on a story about their collective experiences in the aftermath of the fires.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我们开始讨论彼此的遭遇。我记得我们最初产生共鸣的一点是重新定义文章的范围。最初的设想是“火灾后 6 个月如何重建”，我们都笑了。因为火灾后 6 个月，你仍然会深陷于成千上万个政府机构的泥潭中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: We started just having conversations about what we were going through. Yeah. I think one of the first things that we really connected on was almost reframing the scope of the article that at one point was how to rebuild in the 6 months after a fire. And we both kind of chuckled because we were like, six months after the fire, you will still be mired in a thousand governmental agencies.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我们当时正处于那种状态，无法以旁观者的视角去评判什么有效、什么无效。但我知道我的许多邻居和社区里的人都完全迷失了。所以我们把重点重新放在了“我们希望在火灾前做过、了解过或练习过的事情”上。这是每个人在灾难发生前都可以阅读的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: And we were in the midst of those, not in a place or position where we could speak to with perspective what was working, what wasn't working. I knew so many of my neighbors and people within the community were completely lost. So we reframed it more as like things we wish we had done or known better or practiced before the fire. Something everyone can read before any disaster happens.

</details>

### 圣安娜风与撤离时刻

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 虽然很多人认为火灾是核心问题，但**极端强风**对这场灾难的影响同样巨大。2025 年 1 月初，**圣安娜风（Santa Ana winds）**在洛杉矶达到顶峰。这些极端的风和干燥的条件导致原本可能被控制的小火迅速蔓延。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Although many people might associate fire as the central problem of the LA wildfires, extreme wind had just as much to do with the disaster. In early January 2025, the Santa Ana winds peaked in Los Angeles. These extreme winds and dry conditions caused small fires that may have otherwise been contained to spread quickly.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 在风暴到来之前，我确实非常不安。我意识到天气状况可能会很严重，因为有一位年轻的当地气象学家 **Edgar McGregor**，他提前大约一周就发出了警告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I was definitely on edge prior to the wind arriving and I was aware of the severity of that possible weather situation because of a local young meteorologist who gave microclimate reports of just Altadena and he warned people maybe a week in advance. His name is Edgar McGregor.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 1 月 6 日下午，我和妻子 Emily 带着两只小猫离开了阿尔塔迪纳。我们只带了一晚上的换洗衣物、一台笔记本电脑和一些猫粮。我们以为只会离开一两天。但随后，火势完全改变了方向，我意识到我们回不去了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: On the afternoon of January 6th, Gregory, Emily, and their two kittens left Altadena with enough clothes for one overnight. He took a laptop and some cat food, and we thought we'd be gone for a day, maybe 2 days. But then, as the day progressed, the fire completely changed its direction, and I became very aware that we were not going to be returning home.

</details>

### 通过摄像头目睹家园毁灭

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 当时并不在阿尔塔迪纳，他和妻子在墨西哥度假。他们通过 **WhatsApp** 邻居群关注着消息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike didn't have to evacuate his home in Altadena because he wasn't there. He and his wife were on vacation in Mexico. They kept a close eye on a WhatsApp thread with their neighbors.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 有人向我们推荐了一个叫 **Watch Duty** 的应用。我们都下载了它，目不转睛地盯着，因为它有关于火势规模和蔓延位置的最及时信息。在紧急情况下，洛杉矶县负责通过手机发送撤离命令。但在西阿尔塔迪纳，直到火灾开始 7 小时后才发出撤离令。而且由于某些原因，我和我的邻居们从未收到过警告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: And then someone shared with us this app Watch Duty and we all downloaded it and we were all glued to it because it had the most upto-date information about how big the fire was and where it had reached. In an emergency, LA County is responsible for sending out evacuation orders via cell phone in Altadena. But in West Altadena, those evacuation orders didn't go out until 7 hours after the fire started. And for reasons we still don't know, Mike says he and his neighbors never got the warnings.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我的邻居 Jamie 当时住在我的房子里帮我照看狗。我们在墨西哥的半夜被对面的邻居叫醒，她坐在车里等待从未到来的撤离令。她打电话说：“你在家吗？灯亮着。你得赶紧出来！你的院子着火了！你的房子着火了！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: Mike's neighbor Jamie was staying at Mike's house to look after his dog. We got woken up in the middle of the night by our neighbor who was across the street waiting in her car for her evacuation orders that never came. And she was the one who called and said, "Are you in the house? The lights are on." She's like, "You got to get out. Your yard is on fire. Your house is on fire."

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 我通过**宠物摄像头**和门铃摄像头查看。当我调入画面时，火灾报警器已经在尖叫。屋子里全是烟。我对着手机大喊：“醒醒！Jamie，房子着火了！”我吹口哨叫我的狗。Jamie 醒了，环顾四周说：“我们现在还安全，但我们要离开了。”我们看着他走出前门。然后我和妻子就坐在床上，看着监控画面，看着房子充满烟雾，火焰冲进窗户，火星从屋顶倾泻而下……直到整个屏幕被黑烟和火光填满，信号中断。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: When we tune into the doggy cam, the fire alarms are already going off. The house is filled with smoke and I'm shouting into my phone, "Wake up! The house is on fire, Jamie." Jamie wakes up, takes a look around and says, "We're safe for now, but we're leaving." And then my wife and I just sat in bed and watched the feed of the house as it filled with smoke and the flames came through the windows and the sparks just poured off the roof and then eventually the feed cut out.

</details>

### 核心教训：自救与社区投资

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 如果你要给那些从未经历过失去家园的人一些建议，你会说什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Is there any advice you would give someone?

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 有两个答案。从个人层面来说，这种灾难会迅速告诉你什么是最重要的，什么是值得装进包里的——那通常只是一个小包。从实际操作层面来说，当自然灾害发生时，如果你在寻找那些“知道该怎么做”的人，他们可能并不在场。所以，**你必须成为那个能救自己的人**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: Two answers. On like a personal side of things, it would be when you're going through a disaster like this, it tells you really quickly what is most important and what is worth packing in a bag. From a practical standpoint, when a natural disaster is happening, if you're looking around for the people who know what to do, they might not be there. So, you have to be that person for yourself.

</details>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: 灾难发生得太快，可能没有穿着制服的工作人员来给你有组织的指示。你必须掌控自己的生存。但过去一年里，最深刻的一个教训是：我非常庆幸自己认识我的邻居。社区里的不同人都在互相支持。这真的是不幸中的万幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bradley Cohen**: In a disaster, it's probably happening so fast that there aren't uniformed crew members with organized instructions. So, you have to be in charge of your own survival. But he says one big lesson has stood out to him over the last year. He is so grateful that he knows his neighbors. We look out for each other or we're trying because nobody else is going to do it for us.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 你需要对自己的直属社区进行一定程度的**投资**，这在灾难中会立即变得非常有价值。不要指望别人为你做准备，你要准备好为别人提供帮助。如果你只是通过打个招呼、与邻居建立联系来投资这种资源，它在生死关头可能会带来巨大的回报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: There's a level investment that you need to make within your own immediate community that will become very very valuable almost immediately. I think it's important to prepare to be there for other people, too. So that is a resource you can't buy, but it's something you can invest in by just saying hello and speaking to your neighbors and connecting in a way that may pay off in life situation.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 这是 Gregory 和 Mike 的第一个重要教训：**投资你的社区**。一个好的第一步是建立一个简单的沟通方式，比如 WhatsApp 群组。下一集，我们将讨论“恢复”：当眼前的灾难结束，你究竟需要考虑和做些什么，才能开始拼凑回你的生活？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: This is Gregory and Mike's first big lesson. Invest in your community. A good first step is to create an easy way to communicate with your neighbors. This could be a text chain or a group chat through something like WhatsApp. The next lesson Gregory and Mike learned is about recovery. What do you actually need to think about and do once the immediate disaster is over in order to begin piecing your life back together?
