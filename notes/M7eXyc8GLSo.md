### 生物科技行业的现状：冰火两重天

欢迎来到 a16z 播客。今天我们来探讨生物科技的方方面面，首先快速审视一下 2025 年生物科技行业的现状。你们如何看待今天这个行业的状况？科学层面又处于什么状态？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome, Lada. Welcome, Elliot, to the A6NZ podcast. Very excited to have you here. And I'm very excited to have this conversation because where I'd love to start is I want to talk about all things biotechnology. And let's take a quick pulse check on the state of biotechnology as it stands today in 2025. So question one for both of you is how do you see the state of the industry as it stands today? And how do you see the state of the science as it stands today?</p>
</details>

近几年生物科技领域确实经历了不少动荡。今年早些时候，大约有五分之一的上市生物科技公司的交易价格等于甚至低于其现金储备。种子轮融资的公司数量也创下了历史新低。所谓的“平台梦想”正受到更严苛的审视。如果你退一步看全局，会发现这种状况已经持续了相当长的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, if you and I buy ideal society, it's been... Quite a few interesting years in BITAC. I mean, earlier this year we had something like one-fifths of public BITAC trading at or below their cash balances. They had like record low number of BITACs raising their seed rounds. Platform Dream kind of judged more harshly and if you take a step back and look at the bigger picture of it all and ask yourself, "Oh, has it ever been different?" It seems like this state has been ongoing for quite some time.</p>
</details>

我们面临着 **Eroom 定律**（Eroom's Law: 即反向拼写的摩尔定律 Moore's Law，指尽管技术进步，但药物研发的成本却呈指数级增长的趋势），平均每款获批药物的成本高达 20 亿美元。同时，中国生物科技领域的崛起也对早期生物科技公司构成了威胁。批准一款药物极其困难，这可能是整个深度科技领域中最具挑战性的部分，因为它不仅涉及工程风险，还涉及科学风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have Erem's Law, which is like Moore's Law spelled backwards. $2 billion per approved drug. We have a rise of Chinese buyback scenes that is threatening the state of early stage buyback companies. And I guess the question is, did we expect it to be different? Because Approving drug use is really hard. It's probably one of the hardest areas of deep tech broadly because it takes not only on engineering risk, but also on scientific risk.</p>
</details>

几十年前，这个行业似乎是以一个更积极的姿态起步的。Genentech、Amgen 的**首次公开募股**（Initial Public Offering: 简称 IPO）为投资者带来了比当时科技公司更丰厚的退出回报。人类基因组计划曾许诺，所有生物科技都将成为精准医疗，为每个病人量身定制药物。然而，现实却走向了不同的结局。在过去两年许多私下交流中，人们的情绪基本上是：这个行业还能复苏吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it does seem like the biotech industry started on a more positive note a few decades ago. Genentech, Amgen, IPOs, they're investors making first huge exits, more so than Intac back then. And we had Human Genome Project that sort of promised that all the biotech will become precision medicine and will develop medicines. as tailored to one patient. And yeah, it does seem like it led us to a slightly different ending. I mean, I hope it's not the ending and I hope there are some positive things that we can find in it all. But in many private conversations during these past two years, mood has essentially been like, will this industry ever recover?</p>
</details>

然而，市场的两端从未出现过如此巨大的脱节。一方面，我们经历了新冠疫情带来的巨大繁荣周期，创造了海量价值。而现在，我们正处于另一端，客观上处于低迷期。我们有大量**企业价值为负**（Enterprise Value negative: 简称 EV negative，意味着公司的现金储备超过其市值，通常是市场极度悲观的信号）的上市公司。曾有长达七八个月的时间里，没有一家生物科技公司进行 IPO。从公开市场到成长型投资者，再到早期投资者，整个链条都出现了阻塞，这改变了里程碑的设定，让一切都变得异常艰难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's never been a bigger disconnect between both sides of the market, right? So as Lada was saying, we had this enormous wave of excess. Our last actual boom cycle in this industry was COVID. You had an enormous amount of value creation and success. And now we're sitting on the other side of that. And we're sort of objectively in a downturn. We have, as a lot of point out, an enormous amount of EV negative public companies. That's starting to change and resolve a little bit, but there was a stretch of seven to eight months where there were no biotech IPOs. There's a logjam that goes from the public markets to the growth investors to later stage investors to early stage investors that just changes milestones and makes everything super, super hard.</p>
</details>

但与此同时，科技进步的势头也前所未有地强劲。你看到有人在实验室里开发零样本抗体设计，有令人难以置信的虚拟细胞项目，早期阶段存在着巨大的转化潜力。对于投资者和创始人来说，这其实是一个激动人心的时刻，因为市场在公开估值和早期技术发展之间存在巨大的脱节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the exact same time, there's never been a better point to actually see the progress of technology. You have people developing zero-shot antibody design in labs. You have incredible virtual cell projects and an enormous amount of sort of translational potential at the early stage. Which I think is actually just, you know, for an investor, for a founder, an incredibly exciting time to be building a new company because there's this huge disconnects in the market between sort of publics and what's happening earlier. Sort of a tale of two worlds.</p>
</details>

### 根本原因：为何新药研发成本高达20亿美元？

有趣的是，现在市场也出现了一些乐观的“绿芽”。一些 IPO 正在发生，或者至少人们在准备提交申请；一些非常成功的并购案也已完成。生物科技指数（XBI）也开始稳步回升到著名的 100 美元大关以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, what I was going to say is I think what's interesting is, number one, there are a couple of reasons to be optimistic today. right, in terms of the market at least showing some of the famous green shoots of optimism, right? Some IPO is happening, or at least people are preparing to file some very successful M&As. The biotech index is above, starting to get well above the famous $100 mark for the XBI. Right. So, you know, there's reason to be optimistic.</p>
</details>

但根本问题在于，如何弥合技术端的进步与希望，同行业根本“物理定律”之间的鸿沟？正是这些定律导致了过去几年里，这个行业并非一个特别有效的投资领域。你曾写过一篇很棒的文章《万亿市值的生物科技公司都去哪儿了？》，你对现状的诊断是什么？这个行业的哪些基本面因素使其在经济上面临如此大的挑战？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the fundamental question. is what bridges that disconnect between all of the advance and promise we're seeing on the technology side and some of the fundamental laws of physics of the industry that have resulted in this not being a particularly effective industry to invest in over the course of the last several years. You wrote a great post, "Where are all the trillion dollar biotechs?" What's your diagnosis of the situation? What is it about the fundamentals of the industry that make it so challenging economically?</p>
</details>

自这个行业诞生以来，监管就一直在不断加强。在生物科技史上，似乎只有一次我们让开发和批准新药变得更容易，那就是在艾滋病危机期间。当时艾滋病患者躺在 FDA 门外，要求以更快的速度批准药物。FDA 当时确实做出了重大改变，允许了某些加速审批通道。但除此之外，或许出于好的原因，我们总是让新药开发变得越来越难，尽管科学在不断进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean, since the birth of this industry, we only had increasing regulation over time. I think there was like only one time in history of biotech where we made it. easier to develop and approve new drugs and that was during the AIDS crisis where AIDS patients were just laying outside of FDA and demanding drugs to be approved on a more accelerated timeline. And if they did make a big change back then that allowed for certain accelerated approvals, but since the birth of the industry, maybe for good reasons, we were always making it only harder to to develop new drugs, all while the science was improving over time.</p>
</details>

我们用于筛选新小分子和抗体的高通量筛选技术，效率比 20 年前高出十亿倍。科学在不断进步，而行业状况却在不断恶化，这感觉很奇怪。我认为很大程度上是监管的下游效应。FDA 开始严格审查药物开发审批流程，源于像沙利度胺（Thalidomide）这样的重大悲剧，孕妇服用该药导致了大量新生儿畸形。从那时起，FDA 不仅要求药物安全，还要求有效。任何试图放松这一流程监管的人都将承担巨大的个人风险，因为监管是在安全与疗效之间寻求平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean. Our high-strip-width screens for new small molecules and antibodies are like billion times more efficient than they were 20 years ago. And what Elliot said really resonates because it feels like the science continues to get better and the state of science continues to get worse. And I think a lot of it is downstream of regulation. Um... I mean, FDA, just in history of regulation in general, like the way FDA started to crack down on drug development approval process is through like huge strategy, I think was drug, teletermide that pregnant women were taking that led to a number of... Deformant is in kids that were being born from those pregnant women. And since then, FDA started to require not just safety, but also efficacy in the approval process. And yeah, whoever would come to FDA to deregulate this process would have to take on like... the way enormous personal risk because regulation is a tension between safety and efficacy. And if we deregulate process, we would have to take on some type of safety risk.</p>
</details>

监管的增长是百分之百存在的。但其实有很多唾手可得的改进可以大幅优化启动试验的流程。比如，在 Amplify 投资的公司中，未来 12 到 18 个月内有三家将启动首次人体试验。猜猜有多少家真正在美国进行首次研究？零。我们已经默认了一个事实：所有人都去澳大利亚、去亚洲做研究，因为我们在这里发明的东西，却不能在这里进行首次测试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's interesting. There's a hundred percent of growth of regulation. You know, there's a bunch of low-hanging fruit that would be just substantially better for starting trials, right? So we have three companies in the next 12 to 18 months that will be starting first in human trials. Guess how many are actually doing their first studies in the United States? When you say we, you mean? At Amplify. At Amplify, yeah. Oh, not zero. Yeah, right. And so we've just come to accept the fact that everyone goes to Australia, everyone goes to Asia to do their studies because the things that we invent here we can't actually first test here.</p>
</details>

所以存在监管障碍。但更有趣的是，将监管创新转化为更便宜的试验成本的机制。假设我们想降低试验成本，这个变化如何实施？事实是，**临床研究组织**（Clinical Research Organization: 简称 CRO，为制药和生物技术行业提供合同研究服务的公司）市场经历了巨大的整合，最终只剩下大约十几家供应商，每家都在 30 年里进行了大约 40 次收购，形成了这些大型临床外包服务商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there is sort of a regulatory barrier. But I was writing about this business vial that was trying to innovate on a clinical research organization. And one thing that I sort of learned in terms of the machinery of translating regular 3 innovation into actually cheaper trials. So let's say that there's a change like whatever variable we think about for trying to actually decrease the costs of trials. How does that get implemented? So, it actually turns out that there's been this enormous consolidation of the clinical research organization market that's come down to about a dozen providers who have each done roughly 40 acquisitions across 30 years to really consolidate into these large clinical outsource providers that most people rely on.</p>
</details>

因此，当 FDA 说“我们希望实现试验标准的现代化，使用电子平板电脑”时，你实际上需要让这些 CRO 采纳这些工具和技术，但他们并不会这样做。他们没有动力这样做。因此，执行试验的实际流程结构本身就滞后于监管的变化。这是一个双重难题：一方面是法律规定你能做什么，另一方面是行业根深蒂固的现有做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, when the FDA says, "We actually want to modernize the standards for trials and have electronic tablets." You actually have to get the clinical research organizations to adopt those tools and technologies, and they aren't. They aren't incentivized to, right? And so there is sort of a structure to the actual process of executing on the trials that lags, sort of a lagging indicator from the changes in regulatory itself. So it's sort of a two-pronged beast. When you think about the cost of clinical development, it's actually sort of what the rule of law is, and like what you can do, and then also just all of this sort of industry entrenchment of what we are doing.</p>
</details>

我认为，即使在法律框架内，人们也有办法比我们习惯支付和预期的要快得多地完成工作，这部分原因在于生物科技的一种文化，即我们想当然地认为这些事情就该是昂贵和耗时的。所以挑战可能不是技术性的，甚至不是监管机构本身，而是结构性的、基于激励机制的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think there are some ways for people to just do things a lot faster, even within the bounds of the law, than we're sort of used to paying for expecting, which I think is in part just like a cultural component of biotech, that we just assume that these things are expensive and take a So that argument would be that the challenge is not technological, that in some level the challenge might not even be the regulatory bodies. It might be something structural, something incentive based, where the way the industry is structured, you have various parties in this case, the groups that... you know, help run the clinical trials that may or may not be incented to be more efficient. Is that the argument? Yeah, that's right. So like if you were to break it down into cultural tech solutions in terms of just implementations and regulatory, you'd have to sort of assign some, you know, percentage at ease. And I think it is a composite of all three.</p>
</details>

### 中国挑战：新的竞争格局

现在，让我们把中国问题加入讨论。对于不常关注生物科技的人来说，中国在生物科技行业正在发生什么？它已经对以及可能长期对美国的生物科技产业产生什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so now let's add to the mix here. Let's add to the soup. The China question. Yeah. So for folks that may not spend all their time thinking about biotech, what is going on in China as it relates to the biotechnology industry? What do we see as the impact that is having already and may have in the longer term to the US based biotechnology industry?</p>
</details>

要理解这一点，首先需要回顾一下生物科技行业的结构。大约在 19 世纪，一些化学公司决定进入化学药品制造领域，比如德国的染料制造商。他们将化学制造和分销能力应用于制药。最早的药物药理作用非常粗糙，比如海洛因、可卡因、吗啡。随着时间的推移，这些药物变得越来越复杂和精确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's worth just backing up and saying, you know, how is the biotech industry set up in the first place? How does this actually work? So at the very outset, in about the 19th century, there were chemical companies that decided to get into manufacturing chemical drugs, right? So these were actually dye manufacturers and making dyes for textiles. and they decided to take their sort of chemical manufacturing and distribution and apply it to making drugs. You're talking about Germans. That's right. And the first drugs were incredibly crude pharmacology, right? So this was heroin, this was cocaine, this was morphine. Higher retention than die stuffs, right? You know, like that's a pretty interesting business. But obviously it got a lot more sophisticated and specific over time.</p>
</details>

像默克这样的公司在 30 年代建立了垂直整合的研究实验室，集生产、分销和内部研发于一体。后来 FDA 成立，现代临床开发体系形成。所有这些业务都包含三个部分：制造、商业化和分销；内部研究；以及试验和临床开发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these groups like Merck, you know, in the 30s, they set up vertically integrated research labs. So they're in the business of manufacturing and distributing their medicines, and then also doing internal research to make new products. And then the FDA comes along, right, so a lot of these top pharma companies predate the FDA, and modern clinical development is formed. And so there's a three-partite component for all these businesses where there is manufacturing, commercialization, and distribution. there is internal research and then there's trials and clinical development.</p>
</details>

问题在于，正如前面提到的 Eroom 定律，内部研究和临床开发的效率变得越来越低，以至于内部研发的**内部收益率**（Internal Rate of Return: 简称 IRR）变成了负数。因此，这些制药公司剥离了其内部研发和临床开发部门。这就是 CRO 和外包组织的诞生，而药物发现初创公司和生物科技公司的起源，就是我们这些“疯子”接手了这项 IRR 为负的业务，致力于创造出可能最终被大型制药公司收购的新药。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happened is that, as Lada alluded to, there's this Erooms law in the industry where it's just gotten exponentially less efficient to do the internal research and clinical development. And so it literally became the case that it was IRR negative to actually do internal research. And so these pharma companies divested their internal research and clinical development out. This is the birth of these clinical research organizations and outsourced organizations in the first place. And the origin of drug discovery startups and biotechs is that we are the lunatics that take on that IRR negative business and say that we're in the business of making these new hits that could ultimately realistically get bought by pharma companies and become their next armamentarium of drugs.</p>
</details>

这就是生物科技运作的模式：大型制药公司外包研发，生物科技公司进行研究。问题是，我们都在使用相同的发现技术。当技术变得商品化时，你就可以在速度和成本上竞争。这就是中国进入这个故事的切入点。中国在启动和运行人体试验的监管方面拥有巨大的速度优势，在劳动力、工作伦理和项目人员组织方面也拥有巨大的成本优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's kind of the setup of how biotech works, right? These companies have invested their R&D, or biotech companies are doing that research. And what happened is that we're all doing that research with the same discovery technologies, right? So I'd argue that beyond the modernization of small molecule discovery, the growth of biotech and recombinant DNA technology, we haven't had, you know, and then subsequent modalities, you know, we haven't had these huge changes in the fact that people have internal technologies that the rest of the industry isn't using. And so like any other technology, when it's becoming commoditized, you can compete on speed and cost. And this is where China sort of enters the story, right? So China has enormous speed advantages in terms of regulation for starting and running human trials and enormous cost advantages. in terms of the labor and the sort of work ethic and speed involving the people that can be put together at these projects.</p>
</details>

因此，在大型制药公司和生物科技初创公司（它们供应了市场上三分之二的药物）之间松散的社会契约中，出现了一种地理套利：中国可以在速度和成本上进入这个等式，竞争这些药物的研发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what's happening is in this sort of loose social contract between big pharma and biotech startups, which are the ones supplying the drugs, biotech startups now make two-thirds of the drugs that go to market. We have this sort of geographic arbitrage where on speed and cost, China can enter the equation and compete for these types of ideas to deliver the medicines.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，十年前中国并非如此。当时没人会去中国做临床试验，那时的监管比现在更严格。真正发生的是一系列的放松管制，催生了今天大家都去上海的现代临床试验基础设施。他们实施的一些措施包括“默示许可”，即你提交**研究性新药申请**（Investigational New Drug: 简称 IND）后，除非官方主动发出暂停通知，否则 30 天后将自动获批。美国则采用相反的模式，需要主动批准。他们还将 IND 不同部分的审查并行化，比如**药品生产和质量控制**（Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls: 简称 CMC）部分和临床试验设计可以同时审查，而在美国则需要分阶段进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think what's interesting is China didn't start in this place 10 years ago. 10 years ago, no one was talking about going and running their trials in China. In fact, they were more regulated 10 years ago than they are now. And what really happened is like several ways of deregulation that Probably about the current modern clinical trial infrastructure that everyone goes to Shanghai for. And some of the things that they implemented were the implied approval, which is when you file your IND, unless they issue a proactive hold on your IND, it will be default approved in 30 days. US has the opposite model where you have to proactively approve. documents that comes to FDA, they also parallelize the review of different components of that IND, so you can review CMC section, you can review clinical trial design all in parallel, while in the AS you have to review them in stages. them in stages.</p>
</details>

更值得注意的是“研究者发起的试验”（investigator-initiated trials）模式，这正是大多数人去中国的原因。这种模式下，审查时间可以缩短 5 到 6 倍，对于新疗法、高风险适应症、细胞和基因治疗尤其适用。过去人们认为中国只是一个“打印机”，复制已经存在的药物，但这种看法已经过时了。他们现在在细胞疗法、基因编辑和基因治疗领域处于领先地位，部分原因就在于这种能够快速进行研究者发起试验的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think what's even more interesting is this whole model of investigator-initiated trials, which is actually what most people go to China for. The actual CFDA process is more efficient than in the US, but I don't know if it's more efficient than just running trials in New Zealand or Australia. With investigator-initiated trials, your view timelines are cut 5 to 6x. It's a very fast process and it's really specific to new modalities, high risk indications, cell engine therapy, and that's what everyone goes to China for. I think it's a model of people used to view China as a need to buy a printer where they print the medicines that would already otherwise exist. So yeah, I think it's... somewhat outdated view, they are now leading in in-devocities, they are leading in gene editing and gene therapy and partially due to this ability to do those investigator initiated trials.</p>
</details>

### 美国生物科技的未来：创新是唯一出路

那么，这对美国生物科技产业的长期未来意味着什么？我们的产业会被掏空吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so given that that that's a reality today, what does that imply for the long term future of the US biotech industry? Right, because you can make the argument that if we're competing on scale, speed, cost, and there's still a lot of great innovation happening here in the US, at some point it becomes difficult to fund that innovation. Here we talk about things being IRR negative, it becomes increasingly difficult to fund that innovation here if we know it's going to get out-competed over the longer term in China. So does our industry get hollowed out?</p>
</details>

不。我认为答案很简单：我们必须去发明。有一位出色的中国分析师叫 Dan Wang，他写了一本关于当前中美结构的好书。一句话的梗概是：中国是一个工程师国家，而美国是一个律师国家。这当然是简化的说法，但我们忘记了我们也是一个卓越的发明家国家。本杰明·富兰克林是我们的国父之一，我们的美国研究型大学令世界羡慕。我们在从零到一的创新上非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. I think the answer is somewhat simple. I think we have to invent stuff. So there's this really good China analyst named Dan Wang who just wrote a really good book on the whole structure between China and the United States right now. And the one-sentence meme version is that China is an engineering state and America is a lawyer state. And I think that's simplistic, right? That's not Dan's full argument, but we forget that we're also an incredible inventor state, right? So some of our founding fathers, we have Benjamin Franklin as one of the US's founding fathers, right? We have the American research universities that are the envy of the rest of the world. We're incredible at going from zero to one.</p>
</details>

如果你谈论的是快速跟进和特定的套利机会，那么在速度和成本上竞争确实极具挑战性。但如果你谈论的是发明全新的疗法模式（modalities），扩大整个产业的蛋糕，比如重组 DNA 革命（这基本上是美国的发明）和免疫疗法的诞生（源于德克萨斯），这些才是让我们摆脱困境的方法。我们必须通过发明来改变生物科技的可能性。当你实现这些重大突破时，你才能真正创造价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think that to compete on this, if you're talking about something where it's fast followers and sort of a specific arbitrage opportunity, that's super challenging in terms of speed and cost. If you're talking about inventing totally new modalities and sort of growing the pie, things on the scale of the recombinant DNA revolution, which is a fundamentally US thing, the birth of immunotherapy, which is in Texas, right? You know, like, these are these types of things that I think get us out of it, where we have to just invent our way and actually change what's possible with biotech. I think when you get those big unlocks, That's when you start to really deliver value.</p>
</details>

然而，这也改变了风险状况。我们必须真正去推动新疗法模式的边界。在 Amplify，我们始终关注那些技术型创始人，因为未来将由像 Regeneron 过去的伦纳德·施莱弗（Leonard Schleifer）和乔治·扬科普洛斯（George Yancopoulos）那样的科学家来指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it does ship the risk profile though Where I think that fundamentally like part of where you go is Really pushing the boundaries of new modalities. I spent a lot of time with Michael fishback incredible scientists at Stanford We're all talking about what's the next big interesting set of modalities? What's the new interesting mechanism in biology? and so I think that risk profile shifts and like You know, at Amplify, that's what we always think about those technical founders, right? Because it starts to be the case that, you know, it's like the regenerons of the past, right? Leonard Scheiffer and Georgian Coppola, these scientists that are actually sort of going to tell us where the future is.</p>
</details>

但一个反驳的论点是，几十年来行业存在一个很好的平衡：美国生物科技公司发明，全球大型制药公司投资（通过授权、收购或合作）。这种平衡意味着生物科技的发明有时间发展。但现在，中国作为第三方参与者，可能会显著破坏这种平衡。是的，我们可以发明下一个伟大的疗法模式，但我们也必须更快地实施它。创新的“保质期”在面临竞争之前变得短得多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I do wonder though, to what extent... Like I look I think it's a very compelling argument. I obviously very aligned with that The counter argument to that would be that something you said a few minutes ago There was this nice equilibrium that the industry has had for decades, which is you know, you know us biotech invests sorry invents and You know global biopharma invests right they they in license it they acquire it they partner with it, right? that equilibrium basically meant that The by the in inventions that come out of biotech had time to develop But now you have a third player in the form of China that that could disrupt that equilibrium meaningfully So yes, we can invent the next great modality But we have to implement it faster too. So effectively the shelf life of an innovation has gotten far shorter before we deal with competition.</p>
</details>

这确实改变了行业的一个动态，那就是保密性变得更加重要。当你需要更长的时间来发明某样东西时，你可能需要在初期把它捂得更紧一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Talked about this a little bit, right? Where it sort of, it changes one of the dynamics, which is like of secrecy. - Yeah. - In the industry, it's like secrets become more important is like when you want that longer time horizon to actually invent something. You probably need to keep it a little bit closer to the chest initially.</p>
</details>

举一个例子，斯坦福大学传奇的癌症和干细胞生物学家 Ervin Weissman，五年前发表了一篇关于新癌症靶向机制的论文，并立即成立了一家资金雄厚的公司。他们开发了资产并准备进入临床。但在他们能够启动临床试验之前，一家拥有相同机制的中国生物科技公司抢先一步，不仅在中国，甚至在美国也启动了试验。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, and to push back with one example, I keep thinking about this professor Ervin Weissman, who is a legendary cancer biologist and stem cell biologist. from Stanford, launched a few companies into existence five years ago. He published a new paper on the new cancer targeting mechanism, which is what ultimately we think that U.S. biotechs should differentiate themselves on is like new biology, new modalities. It immediately started a company, well-funded. They developed the asset, were taken it to the clinic and before they were able to initiate their clinical trials, Chinese Biotech with the same identical mechanism bid them to the clinic and launched trials not only in China, but also in the US.</p>
</details>

所以我认为保密性确实很重要。许多人开始反思是否还要在会议上演讲、发表论文或申请专利，这在 Genentech 创建时是不可想象的。那时人们会把一切都公之于众，供大家分享。这是一个真正的负外部性。科学交流、开源和技术扩散的基石受到了侵蚀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I do think that secrecy really matters. I think many people starting to ask themselves whether they want to present at conferences, whether they want to publish papers, whether they want to file patents, which wasn't the case when Genentech was created. Back then, people were just putting everything out there for everyone to see and share. That's a real negative externality, right? In terms of just the mean substrate of communicating science, of open source, of this proliferation of technologies. A lot of technologies are built on other technologies. And if everybody has to keep it closer to the chest for that exact reason that your time to actually commercialize your own invention shrinks, that's probably a consequence of this trend that we have to think about.</p>

### AI 的角色：强大的工具，但非万能灵药

说到发明，过去几年我们看到的一大发明是人工智能的崛起。在开发新药方面，你如何看待 AI 的影响？它会是那个让生物科技重获竞争力、再次成为可投资资产的发明吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, speaking of inventions, one of the great inventions that we've seen over the course the last few years is the rise of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is obviously being heralded as being transformative across a broad range of industries, a broad range of applications, creating new experiences, new consumer products, all kinds of things. Lots of use cases that we would have never imagined. Where do you view the impact of AI when it comes to developing new drugs? Is that the invention that actually makes biotech competitive again, that makes biotech an investable asset again?</p>
</details>

我认为问题不在于 AI 是否有用。我坚信五年后生物科技行业的每个人都会使用 AI。对我来说，问题是：它能把 25 亿美元的药物开发成本降到 5 亿美元吗？能把时间效率提高四倍吗？要回答这个问题，我们必须看看钱都花在了哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's sort of not a question of whether AI will be useful. I'm definitely in the camp of like everyone will be using AI in the biotech industry five years from now. For me, it's more of a question. Can it take two and a half billion dollar stopper with drug and make it into 500 million dollar stopper with drug? Can it make it like 4x more efficient in terms of timeline? And I think to answer that question, we really should go back and look where most of that money is spent right now.</p>
</details>

大部分钱并非花在临床前阶段，而是花在验证人体安全性和有效性上，以及三期临床试验后的商业化阶段。到目前为止，我们看到的大部分 AI 努力都集中在临床前阶段：能否更快地完成小鼠毒性研究？能否实现细胞系的计算机毒性预测？这些都很有价值，但它们并不能弥合鸿沟，也无法改善临床试验的失败率——目前失败率最高的是二期，即有效性验证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And most of it spent is not in the preclinical stage. It's spent in validating safety and efficacy in humans. It's spent on commercialization stage, which is what happens after phase three clinical trials. And I think so far, and maybe at stake would be different from mine, a lot of the efforts that we are seeing are concentrated on the preclinical stage. Can we make toxicity studies in mice much faster? Can we have in silica tox for cell lines? And a lot of those things are valuable, but they don't necessarily bridge the gap. And it don't necessarily improve the failure rate of clinical trials, which is like the highest failure rate right now is phase two, which is efficacy.</p>
</details>

如果我看到这些公司开始使用和生成更多的人体数据来训练模型，我会变得更乐观。我认为许多生物学领域的重大问题和开放性问题会比我们能预测药物疗效更早地被 AI 解决。比如虚拟细胞可能并不遥远，我们已经拥有了生成它所需的所有数据。问题是，我们如何利用它来预测药物在人体中的疗效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if we were, if I started to see those same companies use and generate more human data to apply to those models, I think I would become more optimistic. I actually think many big bio problems and open questions will be solved with AI way before we can predict efficacy for drugs. But I think virtual cells is actually not that far out. I think we have all the necessary data to generate something like that. The question is like, how can we make it useful for predicting efficacy of drugs? in humans. Yeah.</p>
</details>

AI 正在成为生物学和生物学家一个重要的新实验工具，就像软件曾经一样，这已成为共识。我喜欢用“Eroom 定律的三骑士”来评估它的用处：
1.  **临床开发的时间和成本**：这是一个难以攻克的巨大障碍，涉及监管、文化等因素。
2.  **二期失败的挑战**：这基本上反映了我们对生物学理解的不足。我们无法高精度地预测什么会起作用。
3.  **分子表达的局限性**：我们有很多想法，但无法将这些想法转化为分子，制造出新药。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think Laura's right. The answer is probably unequivocally yes. It's like it's becoming consensus that AI is a pretty important new experimental tool for biology and biologists, just as software was. The way that I like to evaluate where it's useful right now, is if you sort of break down like the three horsemen of Eroon's law of the time and cost of clinical development, right? That's an enormous pillar that's sort of hard to tackle. We sort of talked about that of tech. Probably software 1.0 can help a lot there. Regulation, culture. One layer deeper you have the challenge of phase two failure, which is basically a readout on the fact that we don't understand biology. Right. We can't predict what's going to work and what's not going to work with high-radiability. Yeah. So sort of efficacy prediction on net new targets or sort of hypotheses for a mechanism. And then the third being that there's an enormous amount of interest in ideas that we have, but we actually can't express those ideas in molecules and sort of make new drugs. So that's sort of a third pillar of why it's really hard to make exciting new medicines.</p>
</details>

AI 很难显著改变临床开发的时间和成本，但在制造“原本不可能的药物”方面，它展现了令人兴奋的方向。无论是找到有趣的新靶点并更有信心地预测疗效，还是将想法表达为分子，AI 平台和能力都让我们可以制造出没有这些工具就绝对无法制造的药物。因此，我认为药物的**目标产品概况**（Target Product Profile: 简称 TPP，描述药物开发目标的系列文件）的雄心将会提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For all the reasons we talked about, it's sort of hard to dramatically change the time and cost if you're doing preclinical discovery when it comes to clinical development. But when it comes to making things that are otherwise impossible medicines, so either finding really interesting new targets and having higher confidence in predicting the efficacy of a drug, there are some exciting directions. And then especially when it comes to expressing ideas in molecules. I think that a lot of these platforms and capabilities to take new interesting data sets, to take what's coming out of molecular machine learning, and just make things that are unequivocally impossible to make without these tools, make some really, really exciting medicines. And so I think that the ambition of a TPP will go up.</p>

### 下一个前沿：长寿科学与重磅炸弹药物

你曾提到，行业的下一个重大胜利将来自何方？你认为行业真正需要攻克的难题是衰老和长寿。关于衰老和长寿，你认为行业做对了什么，又在哪些方面仍有欠缺？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You in your piece on the Where are the Trillion Dollar Biotechs talk a little bit about where will the next big wins for the industry come from? And you talk about finding diseases based on genetic basis, rare diseases where we can have a big impact. You have a couple of other examples, but really if I've read your conclusion correctly, where you land is the real big nut to crack for the industry is to go after the disease of and to solve to the extent that we can longevity. What's your view on what the industry is doing right and where the industry is still lacking when it comes to all things aging and longevity?</p>
</details>

不幸的是，开发抗衰老药物的激励机制仍然不到位。在美国的支付体系中，为老年人群疾病支付最多的是 65 岁以后生效的联邦医疗保险（Medicare）。在此之前，我们是一个多方支付系统，患者每隔几年就会更换保险。因此，保险公司几乎没有动力为生命早期的预防性药物买单。而一旦你到了 65 岁，那就不再是预防医学，而是治疗疾病本身了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think unfortunately the incentive to develop aging drugs is still not quite there because if you look at the US payer system, The payer that pays the most for diseases of age population as Medicare, which kicks in after 65. Before then, we have a multiplayer system where patients tend to rotate their insurance every few years. And so there's really not much incentive for someone to cover preventative medicine early in life. And once you hit 65, it's no longer preventative medicine. um, treating the disease itself.</p>
</details>

但我对 **GLP-1**（Glucagon-like peptide-1: 胰高血糖素样肽-1，一类最初用于治疗糖尿病，后在减肥领域取得巨大成功的药物）感到非常兴奋。我可能不是第一个说 GLP-1 可能是首批抗衰老药物的人。本月礼来公司将公布其司美格鲁肽在阿尔茨海默症试验中的数据，这对我来说是检验它是否是抗衰老药物的真正考验，因为它已经远远超出了代谢性疾病的范畴。然而，Medicare 拒绝为肥胖症覆盖 GLP-1 药物，所以我们能否为抗衰老疾病覆盖 GLP-1 还不清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think a lot of it would be downstream of fixing how we pay for aging drugs, how we pay for preventative care. I don't know if we have a way to do that now, uh, not for chronic medicines. especially not for one and done solutions to age-related diseases. I do, I am very excited about Gel P1s. I'm probably not the first person in agent space to say that maybe Gel P1s would be one of the first agent drugs. I think this month Lily's reading out their semaglutide in Alzheimer's trial, which is to me is a real test of whether it's an agent drug or not, because it's well outside of the metabolic spectrum of diseases. Yeah, at the same time, Medicare refused to cover gel P1s for obesity care. So can we cover gel P1s for aging diseases is not super clear to me.</p>
</details>

GLP-1 的成功确实实现了两件重要的事情：它可能为我们提供了治疗一些最普遍、最具挑战性的社会性疾病的方法，如代谢紊乱和肥胖；同时，它在某种程度上让行业重拾了信心，去追求重大的问题和适应症。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's a good, I mean, it's a great argument that GOP wants to have really achieved two important things. It's potentially given us ways to treat some of the most endemic, challenging conditions that affect society, whether it's metabolism. obesity and other factors. And the second one is at some level, it's given the industry its mojo back, right? To go after big problems, to go after the big indications, to find the act twos, because you're absolutely right, you're going to have to replace at some point, you know, this product with the next big idea.</p>

### 前进之路：监管创新与新疗法模式

如果我们能挥动魔杖，改变监管环境或行业的“物理定律”，你们会改变什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of magic wands, we spent a lot of time talking about the industry and some of the challenges that I think the industry faces in getting drugs to patients. If you had a magic wand and you could change something around the regulatory environment, you could change something around the laws of physics of the industry, what would those be?</p>
</details>

首先是每个试验病人的成本。当乔治·扬科普洛斯和伦纳德·施莱弗创立 Regeneron 时，每个试验病人的成本约为 1 万美元。现在这个数字已经飙升到 50 万美元。没有任何物理定律要求这个成本必须是 50 万美元。如果我们想看到下一个 Regeneron，就必须认真对待这个指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sort of two being the cost per patient per trial. That should almost be a stat that the FDA cares about, right? So when Georgiou and Coppola started Regeneron, it cost about $10,000 per patient in trial. That's ballooned to $500,000. There is no law of physics that requires it to be $500,000 in terms of complexity and cost to dose a patient in a trial. If we want to see the next Regeneron, we want to meaningfully care about that as sort of a KPI for regulation for industry.</p>
</details>

其次，创新的美国公司去其他国家进行首次人体研究，这不应该被当作默认选项。澳大利亚和亚洲的监管中有一些唾手可得的经验可以借鉴。CAR-T 疗法的早期开发者 Carl June 最近在 FDA 的一个研讨会上问：为什么我们在美国没有针对细胞和基因疗法的研究者发起试验？如果说中国是工程师国家，我们是律师国家，那我们应该在监管创新上取胜。我们应该成为临床开发和试验审批的灯塔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think like we talked about earlier, it should not be accepted as the default that innovative American companies go to other geographies to run their first in human studies. There is low hanging fruit when you think about the regulation that's in place for in Australia and Asia and Carl Jun, who's the early developer of CAR-T therapy, was asking this in a workshop recently with the FDA. Why do we not have investigator-initiated trials for cell and gene therapy in the US? if there is this distinction of them being the engineering state and us being the lawyer state, we should actually sort of say, let's win on regulatory innovation. Let's be really creative in terms of the way that we actually regulate this industry. We should still be the beacon of where people do their clinical development and where trials are approved.</p>
</details>

我的魔杖会施一个咒语，为常见疾病设立一个类似“孤儿药”的认定。孤儿药法案大约在 1980 年代颁布，旨在激励针对罕见病的药物开发。如今，2024 年批准的药物中 50% 都是孤儿药。我认为我们现在需要类似的激励措施，来鼓励开发针对衰老相关疾病或长寿本身的药物。目前，衰老相关适应症的药物开发失败率是最高的，因为没有遗传学依据，过程更长，试验更昂贵。我们需要激励措施，确保更多公司去攻克这些难题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My magic wand. I would cast a spell and ask for something that... There will be a version of orphan drug designation, but for common diseases. Orphan Drug Act, I think, was enacted around 1980s. Before then, we had less than 40 approved orphan drugs for patients that have a population of less than 10,000 patients. And today 50% of drugs approved in 2024 were all orphan drugs. So orphan drugs for like very, very small population. And I think we are at the stage of biotech development where We really need something like that to incentivize development of drugs for age-related diseases or for longevity itself. Right now, age-related indications have some of the highest failure rates in terms of drug development because there are no genetic The process is much longer, the trials are way more expensive. So we need some kinds of those incentives to make sure that more biotech companies go and develop drugs for cancer where phase ones kill half of the companies at early stages.</p>

### 下一代标志性公司将来自何方？

我们以一个问题开始：万亿市值的生物科技公司在哪里？作为这个行业的历史研究者，你们认为下一波标志性的生物科技公司会从哪里来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so we started this conversation talking about where the trillion-dollar biotech companies are. You guys, you are both students of history of this industry. Where do you see the next wave of biotech? iconic biotech companies coming from? Where would you see them coming from? Where's the next? Obviously, the industry started with the Genentechs and the Amgen and the Biogens of the world. Then we eventually got the Vertexes and the Regenerons of the world. Where do you see the next wave of iconic biotech companies emerging?</p>
</details>

我坚信是新的疗法模式（modalities）。回顾行业历史，解锁新型药物总能创造巨大价值。我非常兴奋地看到，所有这些新的生成式设计工具、测序技术和递送工具可以被整合起来，形成复合型的特定产品。在生物科技领域，我们正处在一个“重新捆绑”的时刻，将卓越的合成生物学、基因组学工具与建模等技术结合起来，解锁以前不可能实现的事情。这就是我们必须走的路，才能持续获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a big believer in modalities also. I think that if you look at the history of the industry, there is an enormous amount of value that's created from unlocking new types of medicines. So I'm really excited for the fact that you have all of these new generative design tools and sequencing technologies and delivery tools that can all start to be stitched together into sort of a composite specific product. So there are these sort of waves within technology, right, where there's specific problems that are solved, and you start to bundle a bunch of different components together. And then there's new ideas that come and it sort of unbundles the stack. And this sort of happens across software, different markets. I think that in biotech we're in this sort of moment where there's a lot of opportunity in rebundling. The types of platforms that I see that I'm super excited about are this composite of incredible synthetic biology and genomics tools, plus modeling, you know, plus other, you know, tools on top of them that just unlock things that otherwise weren't possible. And so I'm really excited about that sort of opportunity to make things that are just net new in the industry And I think that's where we have to go to really keep winning</p>
</details>

重组 DNA 技术给了我们第一支现成的胰岛素；mRNA 疫苗让我们能在不到一个月的时间里，根据病毒基因组序列合成疫苗；第一批人源单克隆抗体则开启了我们现在的癌症精准医疗浪潮。我认为，对于慢性、多因素疾病，也必须发生类似的事情。我们正开始看到隧道尽头的曙光，比如基因编辑和定制化的靶向方法，让药物不再只去肝脏，而是可以靶向肾脏、甚至大脑。我非常看好新的疗法模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, recombinant DNA gifted us the first off-the-shelf insulin, mRNA vaccines gifted us vaccines that we can synthesize in less than a month produced from the genomic sequence of the virus. First, human monoclonal antibodies gifted us a wave of cancer-precision medicine that we have now. And I think something similar has to happen for chronic multifactorial diseases. I think we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel with gene editing and genetic editing. tailored targeting approaches where No longer do our own piece just go to the liver. We cannot target HCC is we can target kidney We can target potentially brain and Yeah, I'm bullish on new modalities.</p>
</details>

还有一个有趣的问题：生物科技领域是否会出现“超级规模企业”（hyperscalers）？许多 AI 生物公司正在筹集大量资金，有些甚至不以制药为目标。这引发了业内的讨论。我们必须相信全新的市场创造。曾经，Illumina 的下一代测序技术销售额为零，现在它变成了一个年销售额超百亿美元的独立上市公司。世界上最大的公司 Nvidia 是一家基础设施公司，那么生物科技领域是否可能出现一个真正庞大且基础性的基础设施公司？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is something really interesting in just this this argument right now within biotech if there are hyperskillers that emerge There's this question. There's a lot of AI and biology companies that are raising a lot of capital and some just have no aims to make drugs And there's this continual, again, for sort of like the background cynicism or discussions in the industry, a lot of people are asking like, what is that all about? I think that there's this really interesting component where we have to believe in like net new market creation. So at one point, Illumina sold exactly $0.00 of next generation sequencing technology to the industry. right that turned into over 10 billion dollars of sales and you know independent large listed companies where their cost of goods sold were primarily going to to Illumina right and I think there's this interesting question right where the largest company in the world Nvidia is an infrastructure company is it possible for there to emerge a really large and and sort of fundamental infrastructure company in biotech.</p>

价值创造可能有两个方向：要么去别人去不了的地方，制造别人造不出的东西；要么随着技术成熟，走向商品化的终极形态，建立整合平台，为小分子和抗体药物提供全套的发现服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think there's sort of questions of either going where others can't and making something that people can't make, or making the sort of final arc of commoditization and building these sort of consolidated platforms that do. all of discovery for sort of small molecules and antibodies as this technology matures. And so it's kind of like two different possible poles of value creation in the instative of bio. Biotech is dead and long live biotech.</p>

我们坚信新的疗法模式，也坚信将会有现代化的基础设施来支撑现代药物的制造。在这两个轴向上都有巨大的价值创造空间。我们对这个未来非常、非常乐观。生物科技万岁。

<p class="english-text">I agree. We're big believers in new modalities and we're big believers in there's going to be modern infrastructure that drives, that underpins the ability to make modern drugs.
