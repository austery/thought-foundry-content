### 极端天气成为新常态：减缓与适应并重

野火季节在十月底正式结束。如果你没有看到火焰，很有可能你闻到了烟味。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wildfire season officially wraps up at the end of October. And if you didn't see the flames, there's a good chance you smelled the smoke.</p>
</details>

在加拿大各地，火灾变得越来越频繁或剧烈。你可能也听说过风暴和热浪的情况类似。这就是气候变化，它正在使**极端天气**（Extreme Weather: 异常强烈或破坏性大的天气现象）成为我们的新常态。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Across Canada, fires are getting more frequent or intense. You probably heard the same thing about storms and heat waves. That's climate change, and it's making extreme weather our new normal.</p>
</details>

那么，我们究竟能做些什么呢？我们可以通过减少排放来解决问题的根源，这被称为**减缓**（Mitigation: 减少温室气体排放以缓解气候变化）。我们也可以改变生活和建设方式以限制损害，这被称为**适应**（Adaptation: 调整以应对气候变化带来的实际或预期影响）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what can we actually do about it? We can tackle the source of the problem by reducing emissions. That's known as mitigation. We can change how we live and build to limit damage. That's called adaptation.</p>
</details>

但问题是，这两种理念是否相互冲突？我们能否同时进行？城市现在应该做些什么来做好准备？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here's the question. Are those two ideas in conflict? Can we do both at the same time? What should cities be doing right now to prepare?</p>

### 气候适应的定义与加拿大策略

建立**气候韧性**（Climate Resilience: 系统应对气候变化影响并从中恢复的能力）是什么样的？**Annabella Bonata**是滑铁卢大学**INTAC气候适应中心**（INTAC Center on Climate Adaptation: 专注于气候适应研究的机构）气候科学的常务董事。她表示，加拿大不应仅仅应对灾害，也应为此做好准备。
<details>

<p class="english-text">What does building climate resilience look like? Annabella Bonata is managing director of climate science at the INTAC Center on Climate Adaptation based at the University of Wateroo. She says Canada shouldn't just respond to disasters, it should also prepare for them too.</p>
</details>

Host: 欢迎来到我们的节目，Annabella。你好吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome to our program, Annabelle. How are you?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 很好。你呢？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. How are you?</p>
</details>

Host: 我很好。好的。我们今天来谈谈气候适应。它究竟是什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm doing well. All right. We're here to talk about climate adaptation. What is it?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 问得好。它与减缓非常不同。在过去的30年里，我们可能在媒体上听到了很多关于减缓的讨论。对于我们加拿大人乃至全世界来说，减缓已经变得更加主流。当我们谈论适应和气候变化时，我们着眼于准备我们的家园、社区，改变我们的行为，以适应不断变化的气候。随着气候变化，我们看到更多的野火、洪水和极端高温发生。现在加拿大出现了以前没有的长时间极端高温季节。因此，我们正在寻找真正适应生活的方式，以便我们能够在这种不断变化的条件下生存。这正是适应的真正含义。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Excellent question. Um, so it's very different from mitigation. We hear a lot about mitigation in the media for maybe the last even 30 years. It's been more mainstream for us as Canadians and in the world. When we talk about adaptation and climate change, we're looking at preparing our homes, our communities, changing our behavior to adapt um to the climbing uh the changing climate. Um, so with changing climate, we're seeing more wildfire, more flooding occur, extreme heat. So we have these uh like long uh seasons of extreme heat in Canada now that we didn't have before. So we are looking for ways to really adapt our lives so that we can live in these changing conditions. And that's really what adaptation is.</p>
</details>

Host: 气候适应何时进入了加拿大的词汇？我们是什么时候开始考虑这个问题的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did climate adaptation enter the Canadian lexicon? When did we start thinking about this?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 这个问题很好，因为我们其实很多年前就知道适应了。所以，它也是与减缓一起发展的，但没有人太关注它，因为如果谈论适应，感觉就像是对气候变化放弃了。但在过去的十年里，加拿大发生了真正的转变。气候变化的影响只增不减。我们已经看到了经济上的损失，也看到了生命的逝去。因此，适应真正进入了对话。我想说，它在过去五年里真正成为主流，但在过去十年里一直是讨论的一部分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's really good because really we've known about adaptation for many years. So again, it's kind of grew up with mitigation, but nobody paid much attention to it because it felt like we were giving up on climate if we talked about adaptation. But over the last 10 years, there's been a real shift in Canada. So the impacts from climate have only gone up. We've seen it in financially. We've seen it in loss of lives. So adaptation has really entered the conversation. And I would say it's become mainstream in the last 5 years really. Um but part of the conversation for the last 10.</p>
</details>

Host: 我想接着你刚才提到的一个观点。如果我们专注于适应部分，我们是否就放弃了减缓部分？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on a point you just made. Um if we are focusing on uh the adaptation part, are we sort of giving up on the the mitigation part?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 不，绝不。我们绝不希望那样发生。两者需要同时进行。这也是我们从加拿大各地从事这类工作的人那里听到越来越多的声音。我们需要将两者结合起来，而不是将它们视为独立的。如果我们只减缓而不为社区应对影响做准备，我们将继续感受到这些影响，并遭受我们不希望发生的损失。气候变化的影响将继续存在，即使我们今天完全减少排放，因为气候恢复正常需要很长时间。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, never. And we would never ask for that to happen. Both need to happen together. And that's what we're hearing more from people across Canada that do this kind of work. We need to uh combine the two and not see them as separate. If we only mitigate and we don't prepare our communities for the impacts, we're going to continue to feel them and have losses that we just don't want to have, um, the impacts will continue to be felt from climate change, even if we were to completely reduce our emissions today, just from how long it'll take for for the climate to go back to normal.</p>
</details>

Host: 适应何时成为加拿大的一项官方战略？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did adaptation become an official strategy here in Canada?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 2023年。所以，我确实有一个年份。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2023. So, I do have a year.</p>
</details>

Host: 所以，相当近期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, fairly recent.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 非常近期。是的，我们仍在摸索中。联邦政府在2023年发布了他们的国家适应战略，其中包含26个目标，旨在让加拿大人了解极端天气，并学习如何在社区和家庭层面采取行动以降低风险。所以我们仍在全国范围内实施这些战略。在这方面做了很多工作，但对我们来说这是非常新的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Super recent. Yeah, we're still kind of learning our way through it. Um the federal government released their national adaptation strategy in 2023 with 26 targets for Canadians to learn about extreme weather and to learn what to do as communities and at the household level to reduce their risk. Uh so we're still implementing those strategies um across the country. There's a lot of work being done on it, but it's super new for us.</p>
</details>

### 野火适应：从家庭到社区的行动

Host: 我想谈谈一些实际的例子。你是野火方面的专家。所以我想我们从那里开始。如果我们看适应，它在野火方面是什么样的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to get into some real world examples. you are an expert in wildfires. So I think let's start with that. Um if we were to look at adaptation, what does it look like in the terms of wildfires?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 野火的适应有不同的层面。我们可以从家庭层面开始。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are different levels of adaptation for wildfire. So we can start at the home level.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的。人们可以做很多事情，我喜欢野火适应的这一点。每个人都可以做到。所以如果你这个周末有时间，我们差不多要进入淡季了。野火季节快结束了，对吧？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. There's so much that people can do and I I kind of love that about wildfire about adaptation. Everyone can do it. So if you have some time this weekend, we're almost in the off season. Wildfire season's ending,</p>
</details>

Host: 十月底。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? End of October.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的，没错。这是在冬天之前检查你院子的最佳时机。清理你的院子，如果有任何干燥的碎屑，清除它们。确保你的露台下或房屋周围没有任何东西。房屋周围1.5米的区域保持尽可能干净非常重要。如果你使用覆盖物，考虑将其改为土壤或石头，这样可以真正防止你的房屋被烧毁或处于危险之中。大多数房屋都是被余烬烧毁的。所以即使野火没有发生在你的社区附近，余烬也可能落在这些地方并引燃房屋。所以，请考虑清理一些植被，并减少离房屋较远处的堆积物。所以即使你有一些大而美丽的树木，也要尽量保持它们的健康。清除2米以下的树枝。这样火就无处可去。你只是在切断这些区域，火就无法蔓延。所以房主有很多事情可以做，我真的鼓励他们去研究并尽可能多地做。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly. This is a perfect time right before winter to go and look at your yard. Clean up your yard if there's any dry debris. Remove it. Make sure there's nothing under your deck or around your home. The 1.5 perimeter around the home is really important to keep as clear as possible. Um if you have mulching, consider changing that to like soil um to changing it to rocks and like that will really prevent your home from burning or being in danger. Um most homes burn from embers. So even if a wildfire is not occurring close to your community, um the embers can land in those spaces and ignite the home. So just think about that, clearing some of the vegetation and reducing some of the buildup farther away from the home. So even if you have some big beautiful trees, just try to maintain them as healthy as possible. Remove branches up to 2 mters. Um and that way the fire has nowhere to go. You're just cutting those areas so the fire can't travel. Um, so lots for homeowners to do and I really encourage them to to look into that and do as much as possible.</p>
</details>

Host: 好的。那么我们从房主谈到更大的范围。当涉及到森林时，无论是企业还是市政当局，我们还能做些什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So let's go from homeowners, let's go bigger. What else can we do when it comes to forest whether it's businesses or municipalities?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的。还有很多事情需要做，每个人都需要参与进来以降低风险。所以企业、市政当局需要考虑那些更大的项目。我们的基础设施在哪里？它是否靠近林区？那么我们需要在这些区域周围建立防火带。我们还需要确保我们有足够的消防用水，例如。所以，2023年发生的一些火灾，就是没有足够的消防用水来扑灭这些火灾。所以，确保这方面始终达标。这被认为是适应和准备。确保人们意识到他们的风险并提供教育资源，这也被认为是准备。这不会给市政当局或企业带来任何成本。然后，一些更大的事情是我们如何设计我们的社区。所以，如果我们正在考虑在加拿大扩展社区和住房，这是一个很大的话题，我们将在哪里建造这些房屋？如果它们靠近**林地城市交界区**（Wildland Urban Interface: 野生地与城市区域接壤的区域），野火发生的地方，那么，让我们清理一些植被。让我们确保房屋在建造之前就具备野火韧性。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And there's so much that needs to be done and everybody needs to participate to reduce risk. So businesses, municipalities, they need to think about those bigger projects. So where is our infrastructure? Is it close to forested areas? Then we need to create fire brakes around those areas. We also need to make sure we have enough firefighting uh water, for example. So, some of the fires that occurred in 2023, there just wasn't enough fire uh sorry, enough water to fight those fires off. So, making sure that's always up to par. Um that's considered adaptation and preparedness. Uh making sure that people are aware of their risk and providing um educational resources, that's considered preparedness as well. That doesn't cost municipalities or businesses anything to do. Um, and then some of the bigger things are how we design our communities. So, if we're thinking of expanding communities and housing in Canada, which is a big conversation right now, where are we going to build those homes? And if they're close to the that wildland urban interface where wildfires happen, um, let's clear some of the vegetation. Let's make sure that the homes are wildfire resilient before we build them.</p>
</details>

Host: 我有一个问题。当你谈到房主和企业时，我们在疫情期间了解到，很多人把自然森林作为一种第三空间。我自己喜欢种植。我有一个美丽的花园，我喜欢打理。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do have a question. When you talk about the homeowners and um businesses, what we learned during co is that we a lot of people used nature forests as sort of a third space. I myself love planting. I've I've got a beautiful garden that I like to tend to.</p>
</details>

Host: 对于很多听众来说，这可能很难接受，比如“哦，你知道，我家附近不能有覆盖物，不能有那些东西。”你如何说服人们，这可能不是最容易做到的？因为他们可能也会觉得这很难。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It might be hard for a lot of people who who are listening to be like, oh, you know, no mulch, none of that stuff near my house. How do you try to convince people that, you know, perhaps it's not uh the easiest? Because they might have a hard time with that as well.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 这是一个很好的观点。很多人听到我们说的话，他们会说：“哦，那我必须移除我的植被或砍掉我的树吗？”我们绝不会那样说，因为那对你的家园、对环境都不好。我们有传粉花园。除了野火风险之外，我们还关心很多其他事情。所以首先，你是否有野火风险？如果你有，而且你应该从过去五年加拿大发生的事情中了解，或者咨询你的市政当局，那么你就应该开始实施一些这些行动。话虽如此，也有非常美丽且防火、抗火的花园。**Fires Smart BC**（一个专注于野火防范的组织）有一个令人难以置信的防火植物清单。前几天我在一封电子邮件中看到，玉簪（hostas），它们很常见，是那种大花。是的，人们喜欢它们。它们是防火的。我以前不知道这一点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's such a good point. A lot of people hear what we say and they say, "Oh, so I have to remove my vegetation or cut down my trees." We would never say that cuz that wouldn't even be good for your home, for the environment. We have pollinator gardens. There's so much that we care about outside of just a wildfire risk. Um, so first, are you at risk of wildfire? And if you are, and and you should know from what we've seen the past 5 years happen in Canada or just speak to your municipality, then you should start to implement some of these actions. Now, with that being said, there are incredibly beautiful gardens that are fireresistant, fire resilient. Um, Fires Smart BC has an incredible list of plants that are fireresistant. The other day in an email I got that hostas, they're pretty common, like big flower. Yeah, people love them. They're fire resistant. I I didn't know this.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 我不是一个园艺高手。所以对于园艺爱好者来说，有很多美丽的植物可以种植在房屋附近。只需维护它们，保持湿润。你需要确保它们是湿的。如果你的植物干枯了，你就会给你的家园制造危险。所以，维护一个好的花园实际上对防火韧性来说是完美的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not a big gardener. Um, so for gardeners, there are tons of beautiful plants that they can plant close to the home. Um, and just maintain them, keep them moisturized. Uh, you want to make sure that they're like wet. If your plants dry out, you're creating a hazard for your home. So, h maintaining a good garden is actually perfect for for fire resilience.</p>
</details>

### 洪涝适应：个人与城市的职责

Host: 你谈到了水，谈到了保持植物湿润。现在我想谈谈洪涝。从房主的角度来看，当我们谈论适应洪涝时，我们能做些什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talked about uh water uh keeping your plants wet. I want to talk about flooding now. Um, from a homeowner's perspective, uh, what can we do when it when we talk about adapting to flooding?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的，房主和居民可以做很多事情。所以看看你的家。你有什么？如果你有地下室，想想你的贵重物品，例如。这是你可以做的第一个简单的事情。把它们放高一点。所以即使你必须把它们放在地下室，也要考虑一些置物架，或者使用一些防水的容器来存放你的贵重物品。这样万一你的地下室被淹，你可以保护它们。所以你要把东西抬高大约30厘米。你可以安装一个**污水泵**（Sump Pump: 用于排出地下室积水的泵），不是每个家庭都能安装，但如果你能安装，那对于排水来说是极好的。但在房屋外面，有很多事情可以做。所以，比如在你的社区里散步，你会发现随着秋天树叶的飘落，我们的排水沟会被覆盖，清理可能需要时间。所以，清理这些排水沟将有助于水在降下时排出。检查你的屋檐排水槽，确保它们也畅通。你不想让树叶堵塞它们，这样水才能流过。最后一个比较简单的方法是延长落水管。我喜欢在社区里散步，看看人们都在做什么。有些落水管直接通向地基。所以，只需考虑将其延长几米到街道排水沟。这样你已经在很大程度上保护了你的家。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's again tons that homeowners can do that residents can do. Um, so look around your home. What what do you have? If you have a basement, um, think about your valuables, for example. That's the first easy thing that you can do. Put them higher up. So even if you have to have them in the basement, think of some shelving units or having containers that are a bit w water resistant for your valuables. So in case that your fa basement floods, you can protect it. So you're looking at like about 30 cm to keep things raised. Um you can have a sump pump, which not every home can have, but if you can, that's excellent for taking the water out. But outside their home, there's a lot that can be done. Um so like take a walk around your neighborhood and you'll see that with the leaves that are falling now in the fall, um our drains get covered and some of the cleaning might take time to do. Um, so just clearing those drains will help the water just drain when it comes down. Um, looking at your eve straws, making sure that they're clear as well. You don't want to have leaves in them so that water can flow through. Um, and the last one that's pretty easy is extending down spouts. So, I love to take walks around the neighborhood and kind of look at what people have going on. Um, some downspouts are going right into the foundation. So, just think about um extending it by a couple of meters into the drain uh the street drain. And you're already doing so much to protect your home.</p>
</details>

Host: 城市能做些什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What can the city do?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 城市可以做很多事情，而且他们正在非常努力地工作。我确实想表扬加拿大一些在过去几年里处理了大量洪涝问题的城市。我们一些城市的基础设施比较老旧，所以我们的供水系统是合并的。当这些系统建造时，并没有考虑到气候变化。所以它们是为应对过去而非现在存在的降雨事件而建造的。因此，更大的基础设施项目正在升级我们的供水系统，我今年夏天看到了很多这样的情况。我们知道夏天是加拿大的施工季节，我看到那些街道被挖开，人们可能会因为街道不通而感到不快，但这是有原因的。没错。一个很好的原因。下次下雨时，你的道路就不会被淹了。在较小的规模上，市政当局可以分发关于房主如何保护自己免受洪涝的信息。最大的一个，也是我们之前谈到的，你知道，在疫情期间人们喜欢外出享受大自然，维护大自然，让大自然回归。所以我们的**湿地**（Wetlands: 具有独特生态系统的水域和陆地交界区域）在阻止降雨、清洁水方面非常有效。而且确实能减缓水流，从而防止洪涝发生。所以想想你社区里的湿地。我们不要在湿地上建造，让我们维护它们。它们为我们做了很多工作。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot that cities can do and they're working super hard. I I do want to commend a few cities in Canada that have dealt with a lot of flooding over the past few years. Um we have older infrastructure in some cities, so our water systems are combined. Um the water uh when those systems were built, climate change wasn't in mind. So they were built to sustain rain events that are from the past, not what we have now. So bigger infrastructure projects are upgrading our water systems, which I've seen a lot this summer. We know uh summer is construction season in Canada and I've just seen those like streets being ripped up and people might be getting upset about not having uh like their streets open, but there's a reason. Exactly. An excellent reason. Next time it rains, your roads won't be flooded. Um at the smaller scale, municipalities can hand out information on what homeowners can do um to protect themselves from flooding. And the biggest one and the the one we were talking about, you know, during co people like to be outside and enjoy nature, maintaining nature, um bringing back nature. So our wetlands are incredible at stopping rain, at cleaning the water, too. Um and really slowing it down so that flooding doesn't occur. So thinks think about the wetlands in your communities. Let's not build over wetlands. Let's maintain them. They're doing a lot of work for us.</p>
</details>

### 资金、责任与公众意识

Host: 加拿大是否足够重视气候适应和韧性？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does Canada focus enough on climate adaptation and resilience?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 嗯，不太够。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, not too much.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 我认为我们正在努力。因为这项战略刚刚在2023年出台，所以实施起来比较缓慢。我们确实有更多的资金流向适应，但目前的数据显示，如果我们为减缓投入24美元，那么为适应只投入1美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're getting there. So, because the strategy just came out in 2023, it's it's slow to be implemented. Uh we do have more funding going towards adaptation, but currently the numbers are looking at like if we have $24 for mitigation, we have $1 for adaptation.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 所以目前非常不平衡。但我们看到越来越多的资金流向它。越来越多的讨论转向保护和准备，这就是适应的含义。所以我们正在努力，但离理想状态还有点远。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's very very lopsided at this time. Um but we are seeing more and more funding go towards it. More of the conversation going towards protection and preparedness, which is what adaptation is. So we're getting there, but we're still a bit far um from from being in the ideal place.</p>
</details>

Host: 我们谈到了钱。现在谈谈责任。谁应该负责或正在负责资助它？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're talking about the money. Let's talk about uh the responsibility. Whose responsibility should it be or is it uh to fund fund it?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的。嗯，这是每个人的责任，我知道这是一个糟糕的答案。但这是一个全社会的方法。所以如果我们不都做点什么，房主、企业、各级政府，那么在气候变化、减缓或适应方面，我们将一事无成。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um it's everyone's and that's a terrible answer, I know. Um but this is a whole of society approach. So if we don't all do something, homeowners, businesses, all levels of government, we're not going to do anything when it comes to climate change to mitigation or adaptation.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 从资金角度来看，如果我们真的想追究责任，我会说大部分资金确实来自联邦政府，流向各省，但市政当局处于气候变化的最前沿。他们正在感受影响，而且在各级政府中，他们的资金最少。当人们的地下室被淹时，他们往往会说是政府的错，而没有考虑是哪一级政府。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Funding wise, if we do really want to, you know, look at someone, I would say a lot of the funding does come from the federal government that goes towards the provinces, but municipalities are at the forefront of climate change. They're feeling the impacts and they are the least funded when when it comes to levels of government. And when people's basement floods, they kind of just say it's the government's fault without thinking which level of government.</p>
</details>

Host: 是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 所以，我们需要更多地支持市政当局，才能推动这些项目。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, more support to municipalities is exactly what we need in order to bring these projects around.</p>
</details>

Host: 我们谈到了野火和洪涝，以及房主、企业和市政当局的责任划分。另一方面，气候适应应该有多少来自政府？有多少应该来自个人？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We talked about um wildfires and flooding and sort of the breakdown of uh the responsibilities of homeowners and businesses and municipalities. On the other end, how much of climate adaptation should be from government? How much should be from the individual?</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 大约是五五开。所以，个人有很多可以自己做的事情，当洪水或野火发生时，受损失的是你。即使你有办法弥补一些损失，但有些东西是无法替代的。如果房屋被烧毁，你会听到那些故事，它们绝对是毁灭性的。人们无法替代他们失去的东西。所以很多责任都落在你身上。但是政府在加拿大拥有巨大的话语权。所以，如果他们能创建教育项目，真正提高加拿大人的意识，我今年夏天和很多人谈过，他们没有完全理解他们的风险水平，因为今年夏天野火发生在以前从未见过的新地方。所以感觉可能只是暂时的，可能不会再发生。所以，一个大型的教育项目，政府处于理想的位置来为加拿大人实现这一点，以便他们能够理解，并提供资金来开展这些项目。
<details>

<p class="english-text">It's like a 50/50. So, um, individuals have a lot that they can do themselves and when flooding occurs, when a wildfire occurs, it's you who's losing. Even if you have ways to regain some of the loss, um, some of the materials can't be replaced. If a home is burned, you'll hear the stories. They're absolutely devastating. People can't replace what they've lost. So, a lot of that responsibility falls on you. Um, but government has a huge voice in Canada. So, if they were to create education programs to really raise the awareness of Canadians, um I've spoken to a lot of people this past summer and they didn't fully understand their risk level because wildfire was happening in new places this summer that we haven't seen before. So, it felt maybe moment mon uh sorry, momentary like it might not occur again. Um, so a big education program, the the government's in this the ideal position to make that happen for Canadians so that they can understand and also provide that funding in order to um do the projects.</p>

Host: 你说，尤其是在过去几年里，很多人对历史上从未发生过的火灾或洪水没有准备。但是你认为人们准备好承担这个责任了吗？

<p class="english-text">Well, you say, you know, particularly over the last couple years, a lot of people who are uh weren't prepared uh for fires or floods that uh historically have never occurred there. Um but do you think people are prepared to take on that responsibility?</p>
</details>

Host: 有些事情要求很高。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some it can be a lot to ask.</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 是的。这确实要求很高。但我们也有其他数据。例如，我们每在适应上投资一美元，十年内就能获得2到10美元的投资回报。所以即使我们对人们要求很高，其中一些事情是免费的，比如清理你的屋檐。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And it's it's a lot to ask. Um but it's also so we have other numbers. For example, for every dollar that we invest in adaptation, we have 2 to 10 of a return on investment over 10 years. So even though we're asking a lot from people and some of it is free to do like cleaning out your eaves,</p>
</details>

Annabella Bonata: 你会看到回报。这很难看到，因为如果现在没有发生洪水，你会想，我为什么要这样做？但如果它真的发生了，去和那些经历过的人谈谈。我们有很多经历过洪水的人的故事。他们知道，他们也投资了，使他们的房屋具有防洪韧性。但他们也知道精神上的压力是什么。所以一旦你经历过野火、洪水这样的极端事件，从中恢复是非常困难的。下次你再听到我家附近又着火了，那种感觉和人们的精神压力。如果这意味着内心的平静和对降低风险的掌控，我认为我们要求并不过分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you will see uh a return on it. And it's hard to see because if a flood doesn't occur right now, you're like, why am I doing this? But if it were to occur, speak to the people that have gone through it. We have lots of stories from people that have experienced flooding. They know um and they have invested to make their homes flood resilient. Um but also they know what the mental strain is. So it's very difficult once you've gone through an extreme event like wildfire, like flooding to recover from that. The next time that you hear there's a fire near my home again, what that feels and the mental strain on people. I don't think we're asking too much if it means peace of mind and ownership over um reducing your risk.</p>

Annabella Bonata: 绝对可以。因为它给了你现在就能做的事情来保护你自己、你所爱的人、你的邻居。所以当我们谈论适应时，我们关注三个主要方面：野火、洪涝和极端高温。如果我们谈论极端高温，它会让人感到不适。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Because it gives you something you can do right now to protect yourself, to protect your loved ones, your neighbors.

</details>

Annabella Bonata: 而且它会致人死亡。这让你掌握了一些可以做的事情。比如，检查老年人，检查你的邻居。这意味着你可以真正降低风险，挽救他人的生命。如果这不能减轻你的一些气候焦虑，我不知道还有什么能。因为这给了你一些被证明能挽救生命的事情去做。

### 基于自然的解决方案：城市韧性的新途径

Host: 气候变化已经是城市面临的一个主要问题，但根据**Adam Squeles**的说法，解决方案的一部分可能来自大自然本身。他是一名环境科学家，正在滑铁卢大学攻读博士学位，研究城市生态系统如何帮助城市应对极端天气。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Climate change is already a major issue for cities, but according to Adam Squeles, part of the solution might come from nature itself. He's an environmental scientist who's doing a PhD at the University of Wateroo, studying how urban ecosystems can help cities prepare for extreme weather.</p>
</details>

Host: 嘿，Adam，你好吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, Adam, how's it going?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 很好，谢谢。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good, thanks.</p>
</details>

Host: 非常感谢你加入我们。我想我们可以在公园里见面，因为我们正在谈论树木。这似乎很合适。我们从基础开始。什么是**基于自然的解决方案**（Nature-Based Solution: 利用自然过程和生态系统服务来解决社会挑战的方法）？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks so much for joining us. I thought we would meet in the park since we're talking about trees. It seems adequate. Let's start with the basics. What is nature-based solution?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。所以，基于自然的解决方案是我们有意地利用自然来解决某种社会挑战。所以，挑战可以多种多样。社会有很多问题需要解决，但你可以通过三种不同类型的基于自然的解决方案来做到这一点：你可以恢复已经存在的自然，保护已经存在的自然，或者只是，你知道，建造一个全新的公园或创造一个全新的森林。所以，从头开始建造一些东西。你提出了这种有意性的论点，我们需要开始思考基于自然的解决方案。为什么它在像我们现在所处的城市地区很重要？我们现在在多伦多市的一个公园里。但是为什么我们思考它很重要？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, a nature-based solution is when we use nature intentionally to address some kind of societal challenge. So, the challenges can vary. You can lots of problems to solve for society, but uh so you can kind of do it either there's typically three different types of nature-based solutions where you can either restore nature that's already there, just conserve nature that's there, or just, you know, install an entirely new park or create a whole new forest. So, build something from scratch. You make this argument of of intentionality that we need to start thinking about nature-based solutions. Why is it important in urban areas like the one that we're in? We're in the city of Toronto right now. We are in a park. But uh why is it important that we think about it?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 我认为它在城市地区尤其重要，因为这些自然环境为人们提供了很多好处。这些好处可以从提供休闲区域到仅仅是一个舒适的户外休息区。就像现在，这里的温度比我们在街中央要舒适得多。所以，城市环境中有许多相互竞争的利益，这使得它变得棘手。你知道，很多人想开发住房，建造商店。所以，有意性这部分尤其关键，因为土地使用有很多相互竞争的利益。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's especially important in urban areas because these natural environments provide a lot of benefits to people. And these benefits can range from providing an area for recreation or just a comfortable area to sit outdoors. Like right now it's a you know a lot more comfortable temperature here than if we were in the middle of the street something like that. So and there's a lot of competing interests in urban environments which makes it uh tricky. You know lots of people want to develop housing build stores. So uh the intentional part is uh especially key because there's a lot of competing interests for land uses.</p>
</details>

Host: 好的。我想分解一下我们在气候适应方面可以使用基于自然的解决方案的地方。所以我们要向你提出一些问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. I want to break down where we can use nature-based solutions when we think about climate adaptation. So we're going to throw some things at you.</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 当然。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

Host: 极端高温。这听起来很明显，但树木和自然如何帮助解决这个问题？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Extreme heat. That sounds like an obvious one, but how do trees and nature help with that?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的，有多种方式。所以如果我们以一棵树为例，有一种叫做**蒸散作用**（Evapotranspiration: 植物通过叶片蒸腾和土壤表面蒸发向大气释放水分的过程），它的工作原理有点像人出汗。所以它有助于冷却周围的环境。当然，树木也倾向于提供大量的阴影。阴影也能让事情舒适得多。而且它们吸收的热量比人造基础设施少得多。所以，就像我之前谈到的道路一样，道路会吸收更多的热量，人们会感受到更多的热量，相比之下，如果他们在一棵树旁边，例如。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so multiple ways. So if we just take a tree as an example, so there's something called vapot transanspiration that kind of works similar to how people sweat, right? So it helps kind of cool off the surrounding environment. Also, of course, trees uh tend to provide quite a lot of shade. Shade makes things a lot more comfortable as well. And uh they tend to absorb a lot less the heat than uh built infrastructure. So, as I talked about earlier with the road, like the road's going to absorb a lot more heat and people are going to feel a lot more heat compared to if they're next to a tree, for example.</p>
</details>

Host: 谈谈洪涝。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk flooding.</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

Host: 基于自然的解决方案如何帮助解决洪涝问题？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does nature-based solutions help with flooding?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。所以，以类似的方式，我想回到蒸散作用的部分，树木会吸收大量的雨水。所以，如果有一场大风暴，所有的树木都会通过它们的根系吸收这些水，然后逐渐将水蒸发到大气中。当然，它们也会用一些水来生长。此外，如果你想想草坪或土壤，它们的渗透性与路面相比，确实有助于吸收雨水。所以它能阻止所有的雨水使管道超负荷，例如，你可以让它慢慢地渗入地下水系统。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, in a similar way, so I guess coming back to the evapot transpiration part, so trees will absorb a lot of storm water. So, if there's a huge storm, then uh all the trees will absorb that water through their root system and then gradually um evaporate that water into the atmosphere. Of course, they use some for their own growth as well. Um, also just if you think of like lawns or soils, um, that permeability compared to like a road surface really helps um, absorb the storm water. So, it stops all the storm water from like overloading the pipes, for example, where you can allow it to just slowly percolate back into the groundwater system.</p>
</details>

Host: 我想人造草皮不是我们喜欢的东西。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm imagining astroturf is not something that uh, we love so much.</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。它没有所有相同的好处。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It uh, doesn't have all the same benefits.</p>
</details>

Host: 好的。嗯，空气污染。是的，那是另一种方式。所以，如果你继续以树为例，对吧？所以，一些空气污染物实际上会被树直接吸收。所以，就像树在呼吸一样，但一大堆其他污染物，比如**颗粒物**（Particulate Matter: 空气中悬浮的固体颗粒或液滴，对健康有害），会暂时附着在树的表面。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Um, air pollution. Yeah, that's another way. So, if you continuing with the example of a tree, right? So, um some air pollutants will actually be absorbed directly into the tree. So, as a trees like breathing, for example, but a whole bunch of other ones like particulate matter will temporarily get attached to the tree's surface.</p>
</details>

Host: 我们谈论的是什么颗粒物？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what are we talking about particulate matter?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 你可能会在一些空气污染指标上看到PM2.5之类的。所以，如果你吸入这些东西，对你来说非常有害。所以，每当过去几年发生森林火灾时，当这个地区有烟雾时，你就能看到颗粒物增加，而且，当它很高时，你会感到呼吸困难，但其中一些实际上会附着在树上，然后会慢慢地从空气中被清除。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You might see on some like air pollution metrics like PM 2.5 or something like that. So, this stuff's really bad for you if you inhale. So, um, whenever like forest fires the past few years, when we get that smoke in this area, you'll be able to see like the particulate matter increasing and, uh, you can feel that when it gets pretty high, it's much harder to breathe, but some of that actually attaches to the tree and then will slowly get like pulled out of the air.</p>
</details>

Host: 我们是否需要更好地提高公众对树木以及其他基于自然的解决方案的认识？我，我是有偏见的，但我认为是的。我认为我们正在逐渐做得更好。所以我想与20年前相比，仅仅从我阅读文献和更熟悉这些话题和主题来看，它们确实变得越来越受欢迎。尤其是在气候变化方面，当我们试图找出如何适应极端高温和洪涝时。尤其是高温，我相信这里的每个人，我们都认识到随着时间的推移，天气越来越热。所以有意识地利用自然可以在这方面真正有所帮助。我想有些人可能隐约意识到这些事情，比如他们可能喜欢在公园里度过时光，但他们不一定能完全理解所提供的所有好处。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does there need to be do we need to do a better job at uh, sort of bringing the awareness of not only trees but other sort of nature-based solutions to the general public? I I I mean biased for me but yeah I think so. Um I think that we are gradually getting a lot better. So I think compared to like 20 years ago just from me like reading the literature and being more familiar with it these types of topics and uh themes are really becoming a lot more popular. Uh particularly with climate change when we're trying to figure out how we can adapt to you know extreme heat and flooding. Uh especially heat I'm sure everyone here like we all recognize that it's getting warmer and warmer over time. So being able to use nature intentionally can uh really help in that way. And I think some people might be like implicitly aware of these things like you know they might enjoy spending time in the park but they just not it might not necessarily click about all the benefits that are being provided.</p>

### 城市规划与绿色开发标准

Host: 我想谈谈法规。好的。开发商和规划师在建造时可以利用哪些资源来融入自然？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk regulations. Okay. What's available for developers and planners to sort of incorporate uh nature when they build?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。这方面有很多可以探讨的。我倾向于从我过去的研究中强调的一点是**绿色开发标准**（Green Development Standards: 旨在促进可持续和环保建筑实践的规划和设计指南），这在安大略省正变得越来越受欢迎。它始于2000年代中期到2010年左右，并逐渐扩展到现在的约14个市政当局，可能还会更多。我不知道过去几个月是否有一些已经实施。但是，是的，这些标准允许人们在提议建造新的住宅区或公寓楼时，确保开发项目更加环保和可持续。所以它考虑了与气候变化减缓和适应相关的方面。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So there's a a whole lot that can go into that. Um the one thing that I tend to highlight from my past study is uh green development standards which is something that's starting to become a lot more popular in Ontario. So it started in like the mid uh like 2000 to 2010 like in there and it's gradually expanded out to about 14 municipalities now maybe a little more. Some have been implemented in the past few months I'm not aware of. But uh yeah, so these types of standards allow people when they're proposing to build like a new subdivision or something like that or a new condo building um how they can um make sure that the development is more uh environmentally friendly like sustainable. So it factors in aspects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
</details>

Host: 你提到了14个市政当局。这个省有400多个。所以我们肯定在实现某些目标方面还有些不足。不同的市政当局如何制定自己的绿色开发标准？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned 14 municipalities. There's over 400 in this province. So we're I'm sure we're a bit short there in terms of reaching some goals. How do different municipalities go and create uh their own uh green development standards?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。所以有一些更广泛的合作伙伴关系。比如**清洁空气伙伴关系**（Clean Air Partnership: 一个帮助市政当局推动环保倡议的组织）就是一个真正帮助一些市政当局推动这些标准的组织。我想现在有很多例子，人们会借鉴其他已经成功实施这些标准的市政当局。所以**多伦多绿色标准**（Toronto Green Standard: 多伦多市的绿色建筑和开发标准）是早期实施的标准之一，我知道很多其他市政当局在制定自己的标准时都参考了它。所以我想，只要借鉴其他例子并在此基础上发展就可以了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So there's uh there's some wider partnerships. So like the clean air partnership is an organization that's really helped some municipalities uh bring these forward. Um I think now that there are a lot of examples, people will then look toward the other municipalities that have already successfully implemented them. So the Toronto Green Standard was one of the earliest standards that were implemented and I know that a lot of other municipalities have referenced that standard when they're creating their own. So I think just looking toward other examples and building up from there.</p>
</details>

Host: 所以你提到了多伦多，我们显然在多伦多。告诉我们这座城市是如何制定他们的标准，以及他们是如何激励开发商在规划中考虑自然的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you mentioned Toronto, we're obviously in Toronto. Tell us how uh the city is working on uh their standards and how they're sort of incentivizing developers uh to consider nature in their planning.</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的。这是一个很好的问题。所以，多伦多实际上在某种意义上是独特的，他们实际上为开发商提供了财政激励，鼓励他们超越最低要求，努力做更可持续的事情。所以，一个例子是，我想对于多伦多绿色标准，你从第一层开始，它是一个分层系统，第一层只是所有提交给城市的开发申请的强制要求。但除此之外，还有第二层和第三层，这些是可选的，但如果你达到这些指标，你将获得开发费用回扣作为开发的一部分。所以，有财政激励鼓励人们超越这些要求，而一些更可选的组成部分的例子。其中一个就是如果你试图量化景观中储存了多少碳。所以如果你努力做好，比如融入植被并帮助减少开发产生的温室气体，你就可以获得额外的积分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, that's a good one. So, uh, Toronto is actually one of unique in a sense where they actually provide incentives, uh, financial incentives for developers to go beyond minimum requirements to try to get them to do things that are more sustainable. So, an example is that um, so I guess with the Toronto Green Standard, you start out there's a tier one, so it's a tiered system and with tier one, that's just a requirement for all development applications that uh, come to the city. But then beyond that there's like tiers two and three and those are actually optional but if you achieve those metrics then you get a development charge rebate as part of the development. So there is a financial incentive for people to go beyond that and uh some of the examples of um the more optional components. One would be like if you uh try to quantify how much uh carbon is stored in the landscape. So if you try to do a good job like incorporating vegetation and having uh try to help reduce greenhouse gases created from the development so you can get like extra credit for that.</p>
</details>

Host: 是否应该有更多全省范围的基于自然的解决方案标准？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should there be more of a provincewide standard for naturebased solutions?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的，我认为那会有帮助，因为我认为市政当局会关注省政府认为重要的事情。所以，我们在安大略省有一个叫做**省级规划声明**（Provincial Planning Statement: 安大略省政府发布的土地利用规划政策指南）的东西。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that would be helpful because I think um municipalities uh look toward the province for what they are consider important. So um we have something called the provincial planning statement in Ontario.</p>
</details>

Host: 那是什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's that?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 所以那是一个半定期更新的东西。上次更新是在2024年，也就是去年。它为所有市政当局提供了必须遵循的政策指南。所以市政当局会使用他们自己的官方计划或分区附则，只要它们符合省级规划声明。所以这为市政当局设定了广泛的议程。它涵盖了许多不同的方面，比如你如何保护人们免受自然灾害。所以保护开发项目免受自然灾害，或者，你知道，只是建造更节能的东西，支持交通，这些类型的事情。但它的另一部分也促进了绿色基础设施，也就是我们正在谈论的树木。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then so that's something that's updated semi-regularly. The last time it was updated was in 2024, so last year. And that provides the policy guidelines for all municipalities to follow. So then municipalities will then use their own official plans or zoning bylaws that as long as they conform with that provincial planning statement. So that kind of sets out the broad agenda for municipalities. And one and it covers a whole bunch of different aspects like uh how you should protect people from natural hazards. So protect development from natural hazards or uh you know just build things more energy efficient, support transit, these types of things. But then uh another part of that is also um it promotes like green infrastructure which is you know the trees that we're talking about.</p>
</details>

Host: 在这方面还能做更多吗？或者只是看看它？你提到了各种指南。它是否足够具体？它在谈论基于自然的解决方案时是否足够有意图？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there more that can be done with that or just looking at it? You mentioned sort of the swath of of sort of guidelines on there. Is it specific enough? Is it intentional in the way that we talk about naturebased solutions? I think it could be far more intentional with how it supports nature-based solutions because it's um it's supportive in the sense that it encourages people to try to uh incorporate green infrastructure uh low impact development these types of things that encourage um you know using nature-based solutions but uh it could definitely do a better job by I guess directly connecting that to uh like societal challenges that we have and encouraging those nature-based solutions to be intentionally used to combat specific problems.</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 我认为它在支持基于自然的解决方案方面可以更有意图，因为它在某种意义上是支持性的，它鼓励人们尝试整合绿色基础设施、低影响开发等这些鼓励使用基于自然的解决方案的东西，但它肯定可以通过直接将其与我们面临的社会挑战联系起来，并鼓励有意地使用这些基于自然的解决方案来应对特定问题，从而做得更好。

<p class="english-text">When we talk about regulations,</p>

Host: 这个省的开发商可能会说，太好了，
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">developers across this province are probably like, great,</p>
</details>

Host: 更多的繁文缛节，更多我们需要经历的事情。多伦多市最近更新并引入了热舒适指南。这是另一个例子，说明我们如何思考随着地球变暖，如何将其融入。但其中一个问题和批评是，这些东西有牙齿吗？它们能站得住脚吗？而且，在我们面临住房危机的情况下，我们能有更多的法规吗？我们能承受更多吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">more red tape, more things that we need to go through. Uh the city of Toronto recently uh had updated and introduced thermal comfort guidelines. Another example of, you know, thinking about how we as this planet gets warmer, how we can incorporate it. But one of the things and criticisms were, do these things have teeth? Uh will they stand? And also, can we in this housing crisis that we have have more regulations? Can we handle more?</p>
</details>

Adam Squeles: 是的，我认为这说实话将是一个永远不会消失的问题。我认为在所谓的繁文缛节和所需的调查、开发所需的组成部分之间，将存在持续的紧张关系。我认为这将在未来不断协商，这是规划的关键部分。所以我想，当我们认识到我们建造方式的不同好处时，我们的标准也会随之发展，就像我们想要实现的目标一样。例如，30年前没有人真正谈论建造**净零排放住宅**（Net Zero Homes: 能源消耗与可再生能源生产相抵消的住宅），而现在这很快就会写入建筑规范。这是当前省级规划声明所支持的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's honestly going to be a question that never goes away. I think there's going to be a constant tension between um, you know, what's considered red tape versus what are required studies, like required components of development. I think that's something that'll be constantly negotiated into the future and that's a key part of planning. Um so I think as we recognize different benefits of different ways that we build um you know our standards will evolve like what we want to achieve. So for example um you know 30 years ago no one was really talking about building net zero homes right and now that's something that's going to be in the building code soon. That's something that's supported by um the current provincial planning statement.</p>
</details>

Host: 我住在一个城市社区，我希望那里有更多的树。我看到了很多混凝土。而且我相信很多人可能正在听或看这个节目，他们会说，嗯，你知道，更多的树木，更多的森林意味着更多的野生动物，更多的维护，更多的麻烦，更多的问题。你对那些无法克服这些最初障碍的人有什么想说的？

Adam Squeles: 是的，我想这就是回到教育的部分，我认为我们可以真正分享和强调，有优点，不仅仅是缺点，对吧？所以，我的意思是肯定总会有一些缺点，对吧？比如，树枝会掉下来损坏财产。人们不得不清理树叶，这些类型的事情。但是，仍然有那些我认为需要强调和强化的好处。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I would say that's where it comes back to the education component, I think, where we can really share and emphasize that there's pros, there's not only cons, right? So, I I mean there are definitely always going to be some cons, right? Like, you know, branches will fall and damage property. Um people will have to clean up leaves, these types of things. But, um there are still those benefits that I think are important to emphasize and reinforce.</p>
