title: 美国住房成本居高不下：生产力停滞与预制建筑的困境
---

### 美国住房建设的效率困境

**Joe:** 住房问题在于我们尚未找到将其**离岸外包**（offshore: 将生产或服务转移到海外）给中国的方法。如果我们做到了，那么住房成本可能会像我们在中国制造的其他所有商品一样变得更便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem with housing is that we haven't found a way to offshore it to China. If we did, housing would probably have gotten cheaper, like everything else we've manufactured there.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 实际上，确实有一些公司尝试在中国进行这类业务。他们会在那里制造这些**模块**（modules: 预制建筑的组成部分）。但正如我所说，这会产生所有这些额外成本，你必须将它们拆分成模块，装上船运过来。所以，这仍然是一个非常小众的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There actually are companies that try to do this stuff in China. They will manufacture these modules. But again, to my point about, you know, you incur all these extra cost and all that, you know, they have to you have to break them into modules and put them on these boats and bring them over. So, it's, you know, it's a very sort of niche business.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是 Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我是 Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** Joe，你现在是房主了，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, you're a homeowner now, right?</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's really fun.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，告诉我这有多有趣。我知道你一买新房就遇到了一些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, tell me tell me how fun it is. I know you've had a few issues that cropped up basically as soon as you bought your new place.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我不想谈这个。我们继续吧。不，这……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to talk about Let's go. Let's move on. No, it's</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 不，这是我精心策划的开场白的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, this is part of my carefully planned intro.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，我知道。嗯，这很烦人，你必须处理各种事情。我可能在节目中提过一次，实际上我总体上还算幸运。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, I know. Um, yeah, it's annoying and you have to deal with stuff and I may have mentioned on the show one time, actually I've been lucky by and large,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 但是的，这很有趣。你知道，我记得我们刚在东村的公寓交房后的一两天，以前如果有什么问题，你只要打个电话给物业就行了。是的，我们大楼仍然有管理员，但房东会处理更换东西的问题。然后，我记得我们交房后的第二天，窗户就漏水了。我就想，等等，是不是没有电话号码了？我得自己付钱修吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yes, it was very funny. You know, I think literally the day or two days after we closed on my apartment in the East Village, you know, it's like when there was something wrong before, you just there's just a phone number of someone and you call. Yeah. We still the building still is a super, but you know, the landlord just deals with replacing something and then I think literally the day after we closed there was like a window leak and it's like wait is there no longer a number? Do I have to pay for this myself?</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 那么你找谁修窗户了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So who did you find to fix the window?</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 好的，我不记得了。我不记得了，可能大楼里还有管理员，但我们不得不开支票。好的，成为房主让我惊讶的一件事是——我正在想如何表达这一点——很多住房建设和维修实际上是多么**低技术**（low tech: 技术含量低）。对吧？所以，你知道，如果你的天花板或屋顶漏水了，实际上不是你就是你雇的某个人爬上梯子，用射钉枪再钉几片瓦片。对吧？这一切看起来都很老旧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I don't remember that. I don't remember that probably there is still a super in the building and the super but we had to write a check. Okay, one of the things that has surprised me about being a homeowner is I'm thinking how to frame this, but like how low tech a lot of the housing construction and fixing actually is, right? So, you know, if there's a leak in your ceiling, in your roof or something, it's literally either you or some guy that you hire going up on a ladder and like putting down a few more shingles with a nail gun, right? It all seems very old.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你以为会发生什么？我不知道。会有一些像机器人一样爬上去吗？是的，无人机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you think was going to happen? I don't know. There's like going to be like some like unitry like robots that like crawled up there. Yeah. Drone.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 不，说真的。现在是2025年，我们还在用锤子建造房屋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, seriously. It's the year 2025 and we're still putting houses together with like, you know,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 有人带着一个盒子来，他们翻找不同的螺丝。他们说：“不，这个不合适。那个也不合适。哦，我找到了！”然后他们说：“等一下，我没有合适的螺丝。”然后他们就去城里的建材商店。他们会说：“哦，我拿到了。我拿到了。是的，是的，它看起来仍然和我们小时候差不多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hammers and someone someone comes with a box and they look through the different screw. They're like, "No, this doesn't fit. This doesn't fit. Oh, I got it." And then they're like, "One second, I don't have the right screw it." And they go around to a, you know, in the city, you know, they go around to a construction store. All they'll be right back like, "Oh, I got this. I got Yeah. Yeah. It's still pretty probably the way it looked when we were kids."</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 好的。嗯，总之，我一直在思考这个问题，因为几个月前，**里士满联储**（Richmond Fed: 美国联邦储备系统的一个地区性银行）发布了一份报告，内容全是关于住房建设的**生产力**（productivity: 生产效率）问题，以及从1970年到2020年，住房建设的劳动生产力下降了30%以上。所以，你考虑一下经济发展的轨迹。你知道，通常随着我们发明新的效率方法和新技术、新制造方式，生产力会得到提升。但在住房领域，这并没有发生。仍然是那个人，你知道，带着一个工具箱出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, anyway, I've been thinking about it because a couple months ago, the Richmond Fed put out this paper and it was all about productivity in housing construction and the fact that construction labor productivity in housing has fallen by more than 30% from 1970 to 2020. So, you think about the arc of economic development. You know, normally there are productivity improvements as we invent new efficiencies and as we invent new technology and ways of making things. That hasn't happened in housing. It's still the guy, you know, showing up with a toolbox.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这在我看来是住房可负担性讨论中一个非常重要的因素，但它没有得到足够的关注。谈论**分区规划**（zoning: 地方政府对土地用途和建筑类型设定的规定）很容易，我确信那里存在需要改革的问题。谈论许可证和所有这些东西也很容易。谈论融资等等也很容易。然而，住房是一种产品，东西是以成本建造的，然后以高于成本的利润率出售。如果这个基础成本持续上涨——在纽约市和其他地区确实如此——如果这个基础成本持续上涨，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This strikes me as a really important element of the housing affordability conversation that I don't think gets enough attention, which is it's easy to talk about zoning and I'm sure there are issues there that need reform. It's easy, you know, permits and all that stuff. It's easy to talk about financing, etc. However, housing is a product and things get built at a cost and then sold at some profit margin above that. And if that underlying cost keeps going up, and it definitely has in say New York City and other areas, if that underlying cost keeps going up,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那么无论你做什么，这都会推高住房成本。现在，再说一次，也许分区规划可以帮助提高生产力等等。尽管如此，建造房屋的实际成本仍在持续上涨，这与许多其他制成品不同。对吧？我的意思是，问题在于我们不在中国建造房屋。不幸的是，如果我们这样做，问题就会解决。我们没有。也许我们可以谈谈为什么我们不这样做，但也许有一天我们会，那将会有很大帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then that is going to push up the cost of housing regardless of what you do on. Now, again, like maybe zoning can make help with productivity gains, etc. Nonetheless, it continues to get more expensive for the actual construction of a home, unlike many other built goods, right? I mean, the issue is that we don't build homes in China. Unfortunately, if we did, that would solve the problem. We don't. And maybe we could talk a little bit about why we don't, but maybe one day we will, but that would help a lot.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，就这一点而言，我的意思是，历史上曾有过建造**预制房屋**（prefab houses: 在工厂预先制造好部件，再运到现场组装的房屋）的尝试，对吧？有些旧的预制房屋，比如你在1920年代或1930年代从**西尔斯**（Sears: 曾是美国大型零售商，以邮购目录闻名）目录订购的，它们非常漂亮，我今天仍然很乐意住在其中一栋。但我们应该谈谈为什么建造房屋似乎很困难，或者至少比其他一些东西更昂贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, on that note, I mean, there have been attempts through history to have prefab houses, right? And some of the old prefab houses that you order from like the Sears catalog in the 1920s or 1930s. Those are gorgeous, and I would happily live in one of those today. But we should talk about why it seems difficult to build houses or at least more expensive than some other things.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 还有为什么制造其他产品似乎随着时间的推移变得更有效率，而住房似乎停滞不前。好的，所以我们确实请来了完美的嘉宾。我很高兴地说，我们请到了 Brian Potter，他是 Substack 上《Construction Physics》时事通讯的作者。我订阅了这个，它非常棒。他还是新书《The Origins of Efficiency》的作者，也是 IFP 的高级基础设施研究员。所以他真的是完美的嘉宾。Brian，非常感谢你来参加节目。谢谢你邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also why it seems that manufacturing other products seems to get more efficient over time while housing seems to kind of stack. All right, so we do in fact have the perfect guest. I'm very happy to say we have Brian Potter who is the author of the construction physics newsletter on Substack. I subscribe to this and it's fantastic. He is also the author of the new book The Origins of Efficiency and a senior infrastructure fellow at IFP. So really the perfect guest. Brian, thank you so much for coming on the show. Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 嗯，祝贺你的新书《The Origins of Efficiency》。我们认为住房建设过程并没有变得更有效率，这种想法正确吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, congrats on the book origins of efficiency. Are we right in thinking that housing hasn't become that much more efficient of a process?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 你是对的。你知道，生产力指标，那些指标相当复杂，你可以用不同的方式衡量，不同的事物会显示出略微不同的趋势。其中一些只是显示生产力持平，而不是下降。但总的来说，是的，它没有改善，不像几乎所有其他类型的实物商品都随着时间的推移变得更便宜、制造成本更低。住房根本不是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You are correct. And you know the productivity metrics there's th those metrics are quite complicated and you can measure in different ways and different things show slightly different trends. Some of them just show flat productivity rather than falling productivity. But the general point is yet, yes, it has not improved unlike almost every sort of other like physical good has gotten, you know, cheaper and less expensive to make over time. Housing is not like that at all.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 而且你为一家预制房屋公司工作了几年，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you uh you worked for several years for a uh prefab housing company or something like that.</p>
</details>

### 预制房屋的反复尝试与失败

**Brian Potter:** 是的，我的背景是一名工程师。我做了大约15年的结构工程师。那是我的专业训练。基本上就是设计建筑物。所以我设计过停车场、水处理厂和公寓楼等等。嗯，是的，我曾在行业的不同方面工作过，正如你所说，这对我来说似乎极其低效。你知道，我们用锤子手工在现场建造这些建筑物、这些房屋。你知道，它看起来和一百年前没什么不同。嗯，你知道，在我这边，我们每次都是从零开始设计这些建筑物，而不是像汽车或其他东西那样，设计一次然后制造一百万个副本。所以，是的，当我年轻得多的时候，这对我来说似乎非常落后和低效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, my background is in as an engineer. I worked as a structural engineer for about uh 15 years. That's what my training is. And just that is basically just designing buildings. So I designed parking garages and water treatment plants and apartment buildings and and stuff like that. Um and I had yeah worked at different facets of the industry and as you say it it seemed extremely inefficient to me these you know we're putting up these buildings we're putting up these houses you know on site by hand with a guy with a hammer. You know it doesn't look that different than it did a hundred years ago. Uh we're you know on my side it was like we're designing these buildings from scratch every single time instead of designing it once and then making you know a million copies of it like you do with a car or something like that. So yeah, it seemed when I was, you know, much younger, it seemed like incredibly backward and and inefficient to me.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 然后在大约2018年，我有一个机会加入一家资金极其雄厚的建筑预制初创公司，叫做**Catera**。他们承诺说：“哦，我们会进来，我们已经筹集了所有这些资金，我们会改变这一切，我们将在工厂里建造建筑物，这将大大提高效率。我们将成为住房领域的**亨利·福特**（Henry Ford: 美国著名企业家，福特汽车创始人，开创了流水线生产模式），我们将彻底淘汰这些旧的建造方法。”嗯，长话短说，它根本没有成功。他们筹集了非常非常大量的**风险投资**（venture capital: 投资于初创企业的高风险高回报资金），大约二三十亿美元的风险投资，他们在几年内就烧光了，然后宣布破产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in about 2018, I had a chance to join an extremely well-funded construction prefab startup called Catera that would pay, you know, promised like, oh, we're going to come in, we've raised all this money, we're going to change all that, we're going to build buildings in factories, and it's going to be so much more efficient. We're going to be the Henry Ford of housing and we're just going to sweep away these old methods of of of building. And uh it uh long story short, it did not work out at all. They had raised a very very large amount of venture capital um about like two or three billion dollars in in VC and they burned through it in a few years and declared bankruptcy.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh dear.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，然后，是的。在那之后，我想了解为什么会出这么多问题，不仅仅是“初创公司很难”这种说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then the Yeah. And in the aftermath of that, I wanted to understand why had it all gone so wrong beyond just, you know, startups are hard, right?</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 初创公司自然有很高的失败率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Startups have a high, you know, a naturally high failure rate. Um,</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，你知道，以及他们可能犯的任何运营失误，因为我，你知道，我开始相信他们那个基本论点，即如果你像建造其他所有东西一样在工厂里建造这些东西，它就会变得更便宜，这个论点要么不太正确，要么至少遗漏了一个非常重要的部分，以至于我们不知道具体需要在这些工厂里做什么才能降低成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, you know, and whatever operational missteps they may have made because I, you know, I I kind of came to believe that there sort of fundamental thesis that if you build these things in factories like we build everything else, it will get cheaper. I came to believe that was either sort of not quite correct or at least missing a very big piece such we didn't know specifically what we needed to do in these in these factories to make the cost fall.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 那么，依你所说，为什么房屋如此定制化，而不是标准化呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why are houses I guess so customized and not standardized to your point?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，是的，原因有很多。一个原因就是，你知道，回到你关于许可证的观点，美国有非常非常多的许可证管辖区，大约有20,000个不同的管辖区，每个管辖区可能都有自己略有不同的建筑规范版本，需要强制执行。嗯，你知道，不同的建筑工地有不同的大小和形状，有不同的土壤，需要不同的东西，不同的环境设计因素，你知道，不同的风速。如果你在加利福尼亚，你需要设计防震。如果你在佛罗里达，你需要设计防飓风。所以，所有这些因素都共同作用，使得房地产市场非常碎片化，很难建造大量统一的产品。建筑商确实尝试这样做。他们有一些标准化的设计，可以在全国各地的不同开发项目中投入使用，但在非常非常大的规模上这样做是相当困难的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh yeah so there's a lot of reasons. One is just, you know, to go back to your point about permitting, there's a very very large number of uh permitting jurisdictions in the US, something like 20,000 different jurisdictions which each might have their own, you know, slightly different versions of of building codes that sort of need to be enforced. Um there's just, you know, different building sites are different sizes and shapes and have different, you know, soils will require different uh different things, different environmental design factors, you know, different wind speeds. If you're in California, you need to design for earthquakes. If you need in Florida, you need to design for hurricanes. So, there's all these factors that kind of um conspire to uh make uh the sort of housing market very kind of fragmented and it's hard to build a very very large number of like a uniform product. The builders do try to do that. They have somewhat standardized designs that will plunk down in like different developments across the country, but it's um it's it's quite difficult to do in in really really large numbers.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 告诉我们更多关于**预制房屋**（prefab housing）或工厂化房屋的信息。我的意思是，有过多次尝试，正如 Tracy 所说，它实际上已经存在了很长时间，你以前可以从西尔斯购买房屋。谈谈这个领域最近的趋势，因为在过去几年，也许是过去十年，你听到了很多关于这个想法的兴奋之情，正如你提到的，你曾为一家资金雄厚的初创公司工作。为什么现在？一般的想法是什么？然后我们也许可以深入探讨理论与实践之间的差距。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talk to us a little bit more about prefab housing specifically or housing in a uh a factory. What was the I mean you there have been multiple attempts and as Tracy mentioned it's existed for actually a long time and uh you used to be able to buy a home from Sears. Talk a little bit about the sort of recent trends in this area because you do over the last several years you've heard a lot of maybe the last decade you've heard a lot of ex excitement about this idea and as you mentioned you worked for a well-funded startup why now like what's the general thinking and then maybe we could get into the sort of the gap between the theory and then what happened in practice</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，所以预制房屋就像这个经久不衰的流行概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah so prefab is like this perennially popular</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 这个想法总是下一个十年才实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Idea it's always it's always the next decade</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，是的，它总是下一个大事件。所以每隔一二十年，你就会看到这些趋势，比如一些大公司会出现。他们会说：“哦，我将用预制建筑来彻底改变建筑业和住房业。”所以，是的，这些尝试可以追溯到很久以前。所以，就在二战之后，你知道，我开始研究这些尝试过但失败的公司。所以，就在二战之后，有一家叫做**Lustron Home Company**的公司，他们制造了这些非常有趣的房屋，其中许多至今仍在。你实际上可以去看看它们。嗯，但它们是用瓷器覆盖的钢板制成的，结果非常坚固耐用。但这家公司获得了政府融资来资助他们的运营。他们在一个曾经是世界上最大的工厂里设立了工厂。那是一个改建的飞机发动机工厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, yeah, it's always the next big thing that's going to come along and so every you decade or two, you will kind of see these these trends like some big, you know, company will come along. It's like, oh, I'm going to revolutionize the building with with the housing industry with uh, you know, prefab construction. So, and yeah, these these attempts, you know, stretch back a pretty long way. So, right after uh, you know, and I be I became something of a student of the of these companies that have have tried and and failed. So, right after World War II, you have this this company called the uh called the Lustron Home Company, which made these very interesting homes, many of which are still around. You can actually go um go look at them. Um but they're made these like steel panels covered in porcelain that turned out to be quite wellmade and quite durable. But the company went and they got government financing to sort of fund their operation. They had set up shop in this big uh what was once one time the biggest factory in the world. It was this repurposed aircraft engine factory.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 哦，它们看起来很酷。是的，它们非常整洁。嗯，我住在亚特兰大，亚特兰大也有一些你可以去看看。嗯，但它们在几年后就破产了。在1960年代，有一家叫做**Sterling Homex**的公司说：“哦，我们将成为下一个，你知道，建筑界的亨利·福特。”他们也在几年内破产了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, they look pretty cool. Yeah, they're very they're very neat. Uh there's I live in Atlanta and there's some in Atlanta that you can go and look at. Um but uh they went bankrupt after quite a few years. In the 1960s, there was this company called Sterling Homex that said, "Oh, we're going to be the they uh we're going to be the next uh you know, Henry Ford of construction." They went bankrupt in a few years.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我感觉这有规律可循。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm sensing a pattern.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的。他们是政府项目**“突破行动”**（Operation Breakthrough: 美国政府在1960年代末启动的一项旨在推动大规模生产住房技术的计划）的一部分，该项目旨在资助，你知道，再次资助大规模生产住房技术的发展。那个项目基本上失败了。他们资助的公司中，有很多家，但没有一家成功突破并创造出这些大规模生产的住房产品。嗯，所以你看到同样的事情一遍又一遍地发生，人们试图利用预制建筑来大幅降低建筑成本。在非常有限的意义上，你可以做到这一点。嗯，你也可以通过预制建筑建立一个成功的企业，你不一定非要以低成本竞争，而是像“我们可以建造得更快”之类的。但没有人能做到每个人都想做的事情，那就是成为住房领域的亨利·福特。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. They were a part of this government program called operation breakthrough which was trying to fund um you know just again fund the development of like mass production housing techniques. That program basically failed. None of their companies that they funded and there were quite a few of them ended up sort of succeeding in breaking through and and creating sort of these mass-produced housing uh housing uh products. Um, so you kind of see the same thing happening over and over and over again where people are trying to use uh prefab to like dramatically reduce the cost of construction. And there's ways that you can do that in kind of like a very limited sense. Um, and you can also like build a successful business off of prefab where you're not necessarily trying to compete on low cost but things like oh we can build much faster or or stuff like that. But nobody has managed to do what everybody is trying to do which is like you know be the Henry Ford of housing.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的。那么症结在哪里呢？我知道你列举了一些房屋倾向于定制化的原因，比如土壤类型、分区规划和法规，但这仅仅是为什么我们不能在全美国拥有预制房屋的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. What's the sticking point then? I know you walk through some of the reasons that houses tend to be customized things like soil types and zoning and regulation but is is that just the story of why we can't have prefab houses that are like across America?</p>
</details>

### 建筑效率的核心挑战

**Brian Potter:** 所以，是的，我从两个方面来看待这个问题。我认为很难将这些改进、这些提高效率的策略引入建筑过程，而不在过程的其他地方累积更多成本。同时，我们发现的这些效率提升策略所带来的收益，历史上比你在生产汽车或灯泡之类的东西时看到的要有限得多。与此同时，我们不断增加更多的法规和难度，你知道，更多的行政开销，使得建造东西变得更困难，这正在慢慢推高成本，即使我们没有累积这些生产力改进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's yeah I kind of look at this in in two ways. I I think of it as terms of it's very hard to introduce uh some of these like improvements these sort of strategies you have for improving uh efficiency into the construction process without accumulating like more cost elsewhere in the process. And then so at the same time that that is you know these the gains that we've found in terms of like these strategies for efficiency improvement have historically been much more limited than you see in like if you're producing you know a car or a light bulb or something like that. And at the same time, we've continually added like more regulations and more difficulty, you know, more administrative overhead and getting stuff built, which is slowly like driving up of up the cost even as like uh we're getting, you know, we're not sort of in accumulating these productivity improvements.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 举个例子，好的，这在纸面上看起来像是工厂里能实现的生产力提升，但你却在其他地方为此付出了代价。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What's an example of okay, this on paper looks like a productivity gain that we get in a factory, but then you pay for it somewhere else.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 当然。所以，你知道，一个非常简单的例子，如果你在工厂里造汽车，你造的是一整辆汽车，对吧？它从生产线上滚下来，汽车是完整的。嗯，一栋建筑物太大，无法作为一个整体从工厂里出来，因为，你知道，要把它运到工地或其他地方。所以，发生的情况是，你必须分块建造你的建筑物。嗯，你知道，这就是为什么预制建筑通常被称为**模块化建筑**（modular construction: 将建筑物分解成可在工厂预制并运输到现场组装的独立模块的建造方法），因为你是以这些模块来建造的，而且有不同的策略来，你知道，如何将建筑物分解成模块，但你总是将其分解成这些碎片。当你将其分解成碎片时，你必须添加一堆额外的东西，而如果你只是在现场建造，就不需要添加这些东西。所以，在路上运输它，你必须设计它足够坚固，以至于在卡车颠簸的负载下不会坍塌。我以前在一家公司工作，他们建造的是混凝土停车场，这些停车场是用预制材料建造的。他们建造这些大型混凝土构件，然后沿着公路运输。而这就像是设计，这就像是控制设计因素，即设计要能承受运输过程中会遇到的载荷。然后，一旦这些构件被运输到工地，你必须将它们缝合在一起。所以，你会有所有这些额外的连接件和额外的复杂性来将它们连接在一起，而这在传统的建筑过程中是不存在的。

<p class="english-text">Sure. So, you know, a very simple example, you know, if you're building a car in a factory, you build the entire car, right? It rolls out of the factory line and the car is complete. Uh, a building is too big to come out of the factory all in one piece and because, you know, get something to sent to the job site or whatever. So, what happens is you have to sort of build your building in chunks. Uh, you know, that's why prefab construction is often called modular construction because you build it in these modules and there's different strategies for like, you know, how you break a building into modules but you're always like breaking it into these pieces and what that what happens when you break it into pieces is that you have to add a bunch of extra stuff that you wouldn't have had to add if you were just building it on site. So transporting it down the road, you have to sort of design that to be rigid enough to like not collapsed under like the load of like being bounced along on a truck. I used to work at a company that built um concrete parking garages which are built from pre-fabricated, you know, materials. They build these like big concrete pieces and then drive them down the uh road. And that was like the design that was like the controlling design factor is designing to survive the loads that would concur during transportation. And then once you have those pieces um driven, you know, driven down and gotten to the job site, you have to like stitch them together. And so you have all these extra connectors and this extra complexity and attaching them together that again doesn't exist in sort of the conventional construction process.</p>

**Joe:** 想到无论是房屋还是停车场，它们都应该设计成可以使用几十年，但工程中一个非常重要的因素却是它在路上行驶的几个小时，这有点疯狂。我的意思是，听起来就是这样。是的。就像它会永远存在，但它必须在那里，只是为了那短暂的运输期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of crazy to think that whether we're talking about a house or a parking garage that's presumably designed to last for decades that a very significant factor in engineering is that few hours that it goes down the road. I mean that's what it sounds like. Yeah. Like that that's like that that's going to last forever but it has to be there just for that like that short transport period.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 对于停车场来说，当然是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the case of parking garages for sure.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我想这就是为什么我们在美国确实有一些预制房屋，它们被称为**拖车房**（trailers: 可移动的预制房屋），因为你可以实际移动它们，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess that's why we do have some prefab houses in the US and they're called trailers because you can actually move them,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，好的。就这一点而言，这其中有多少也可能是责任问题？如果你生产预制房屋，大概不是由在现场组装它们的公司来做。通常是承包商或你雇佣的人来做。我想象现场组装的承包商和建造部件的公司之间存在脱节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? Um, okay. On this note, how much of this is also maybe a liability question where if you were producing prefab houses, presumably it's not the company that's putting them together on site. It's usually contractors or someone you hire to do it. And I imagine there's like a disconnect between the contractors on the ground who are putting the stuff together and the company that's building the parts.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 在某种程度上是存在的。我认为具体的责任问题不一定是最大的控制因素。一个重要的控制因素——我曾写过一篇关于这个问题的文章——是建筑成本，即开发和建造新建筑的成本分布是极其**胖尾分布**（fat-tailed distribution: 统计学中指分布的尾部比正态分布更厚，意味着极端事件发生的概率更高）且右偏的。所以基本上这意味着，一个低于预算、进展非常顺利的建筑项目，你可能超预算10%或低于预算15%，你知道，你不能把成本压低太多。但一个超预算的项目可能会超预算100%、200%或300%。所以这意味着，引入一个你不太确定如何运作的新系统所涉及的风险，其回报是如此不对称。它更有可能导致大规模超支，而不是节省相对较小的金额，以至于这些建筑商在理性上被激励不去引入一些激进的新技术，因为潜在成本极其高昂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is to to some extent. I think that specific liability is not the is not necessarily the biggest controlling factor. What is a big controlling factor and I've I've written an essay about this is that uh the uh sort of construction cost like the cost of in developing and putting up a new building the sort of distribution of that is extremely fat tailed and right skewed which so basically what what that means is that a construction project that goes under budget that goes really really well maybe you're like 10% overbudget or under budget maybe you're 15% under budget you know you can't push down that cost very much But a project that goes over budget can be 100 or 200 or 300 100% overbudget. So what that means is that there's so the ri you know the risk involved in like introducing some new system that you're not sure really how it works. It just it's the the payoff is so asymmetrical. It's so much more likely to cause like a massive overrun than to sort of save a relatively small amount that these sort of builders are like rationally incentivized to not introduce some radically new technology that's going to dramatically change how things go because the potential costs are so extremely high</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 对于可能与 Tracy 的问题相吻合，你知道，或者在 Catera 或其他一些公司的情况下，他们有一些愿景，但因为他们没有在全国各地完成整个项目，包括大概的运输等等。规模问题有多大？在这方面，经验如何？比如，理论上，如果你有一个非常庞大、经验丰富的地面分销和最终组装的劳动力队伍或其他什么，那会有多大帮助？以及地面工作人员等等没有全职做这件事的问题有多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For the sort of maybe dovetailing with Tracy's question you know or maybe in the case of Catera or some of these others it's like okay they have some vision but because they're not doing the entire thing all around the country including presumably transport etc. How much is the issue like maybe scale on those ends experience with that? Like in theory if you had a really big experienced on the ground distribution and uh sort of final assembly uh workforce or whatever it is like how much would that help and how much is the issue that people who work on the ground etc just aren't doing this full time?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，这其中一部分是，你知道，这种模块化建筑在建筑行业中有点小众。你知道，有很多这方面的专家，他们知道如何做，而且他们做得相当规律，你通常可以在任何一个市场找到他们。我想说，回到你提到的规模问题，这是另一个非常大的问题，它不像半导体，你可以在台湾的一家工厂生产一百万个，然后运往世界各地，对吧？这是另一个重要的方面，使得从工厂生产中获得效率变得困难，而且这与我之前谈到的，在不引入系统其他地方的成本的情况下很难做到这一点。移动这些模块的成本如此之大，以至于通常在超过一天的车程之外运输就不经济了，因为成本会变得非常高。所以，你看到的不是一个可以大规模生产的巨型工厂，而是即使是那些进行大量业务的模块化公司，它们也倾向于在分布在美国各地的工厂中完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's a part of it is like you know this modular construction is kind of a somewhat yeah niche aspect of the construction industry. There are you know quite a few experts in it that know how to do it and they do it fairly regularly and you can usually find them in like any given market. I would say to kind of you know a different point that you kind of alluded to scale is like another definitely big issue where it's like it's not like a semiconductor where you can make a million of them in a factory in Taiwan and ship them all over the world right that's another big aspect that makes it hard to sort of you get gain efficiencies from uh from factory production and and goes to what I was talking about where it's hard to do that without introducing cost elsewhere in the system that the the cost of like moving these modules around is so large that it's typically not economic to ship it like more than a day's drive because then the costs just get so high. And so what you have instead of like one giant factory that can like produce, you know, at really really large large scales, these even even sort of these modular companies that are doing like large amounts of business, they will tend to be like done in factories like that are spread across the US.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 所以没有**超级工厂**（gigafactory: 规模巨大的工厂，通常用于大规模生产电池或电动汽车等产品）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So no gigafactory.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的。所以，就像你谈到的拖车房，也就是**工厂化住宅**（manufactured homes: 在工厂中建造，然后运输到现场的预制房屋），这是一个你可以看到相当可观的成本降低的领域，原因有很多。部分原因是它们针对的是市场的低端，所以装修之类的没有那么好。但如果你看看它们的业务结构，它们在美国各地分布着十多个工厂，每个工厂服务于一天的车程范围内的集水区。所以，它们不是在一个工厂里建造5万套房屋或更多。它更接近于在一个工厂里建造500到1000套。所以，在任何一个运营中可以实现的**规模经济**（economies of scale: 随着生产规模扩大，单位产品成本下降的现象）是相当有限的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, like you you talked about like trailers, like manufactured homes, which is one area that you can actually see some pretty substantial cost reductions due to various things. Partly it's like they're targeting a lower end of the market and stuff like that. So, like the finishes and stuff aren't quite as nice. But if you look at like the way that their business is structured, they have like more than a dozen factories spread all across the US and then each one is serving like a day drive catchment area. So, they're not building like a, you know, 50,000 houses or whatever in one factory. It's more it's closer to like 500 or a thousand or something in in one factory. And so the economies of scale that you can capture in like a given operation are just fairly limited.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** Joe，我必须在这里提一下，我们没有告诉 Brian 我们要谈论房屋建设、拖车房和所有这些。这完全是他脱口而出的。所以我知道他坐下来，我们就像说：“顺便说一下，我们可以谈谈这个吗？”所以，是的。

### 制造业范式与经验教训

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，可能是像化学制造之类的，或者，你知道，原材料制造，比如钢铁之类的。因为化学制造，你知道，它是一种终极的制造过程形式，我在书中谈到过，它被称为**连续流生产**（continuous flow process: 一种不间断地将投入转化为产出的生产过程），它只是不断地将你的输入组转化为输出，只做一件事，你知道，连续不断，没有任何等待、中断或批处理之类的。它只是全部流动，并在过程中不断转化。这就是化学制造，你知道，非常高效的化学制造就是这样完成的。大多数其他真正高效的制造过程，它们最终都试图收敛于类似的形式。所以，像装配线和大规模生产，就是一种在这些拥有数千个零件的非常复杂的制成品中实现接近连续流生产过程的方式。这就是为什么它如此巨大，这是一个巨大的变革性事物，因为现在你可以拥有这种连续流生产过程，它以前存在于，你知道，更简单的东西中，但现在你可以将其应用于像汽车这样真正复杂的商品，这就是为什么它在20世纪初被发明时是如此具有变革性的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh probably something like chemical manufacturing you know or like you know raw material manufacturing something like uh you know steel or something like that because chemical manufacturing you it's you know the sort of ultimate form of like a manufacturing process which I I kind of talk about in the book is what's called like a continuous flow process where it just like continuously transforms your your group of inputs into the output what of what you're doing just one you know continuously without any sort of waiting interrupt interrupting or batching or or anything like that. It just all flows and is continuously transformed during the process. And that's what like chemical manufacturing is is you know very efficient chemical manufacturing is is done. And most other like really efficient manufacturing processes they ultimately try to sort of converge on something that looks like that. So like the assembly line and like mass production is kind of a way to like get something that approaches like a continuous flow process in um these like very complex manufactured goods with like thousands of parts. That was why it was such a huge that's a huge transformative thing is because now you could have this continuous flow process which existed before for you know much simpler things but now you could adapt that to like these really really complex goods like cars and that's why it was such a transformative thing when it was sort of invented in the early 20th century.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 嗯，我很好奇，以这种方式建造房屋的经济效益或**非经济效益**（diseconomics: 规模不经济，指规模扩大导致单位成本上升）是否会影响你对**小型模块化核反应堆**（small modular nuclear reactors - SMRs: 一种尺寸较小、可模块化建造的核反应堆，通常在工厂预制）前景的看法？我的意思是，听起来有一些相似之处，尤其是在学习曲线等方面，或者你建造地点的土壤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I'm curious does the do the economics or the diseconomics of building houses um in this way do they inform your perspective at all on the prospect for small modular nuclear reactors? I mean there sounds like there are some similarities especially when it comes to like learning curves etc or the soil of where you're building.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 你对这个行业有什么看法吗？你认为有什么相似之处吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you have any views on that industry having come do you think there's any parallels? So yeah,</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，因为这也是一个总是“下一个十年”才能实现的东西，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because this is also something that is always the next decade away, right?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，是的，是的。所以，是的。所以我在书中谈到了**规模经济**（economies of scale）。当我们谈论核能时，有两种相关的规模经济，它们在某些方面是相互矛盾的。一种被称为**几何缩放**（geometric scaling: 随着设备物理尺寸的增大，单位产量的成本降低），你可以在其他类型的加工设备中看到这种现象。基本上，当你建造一个物理尺寸更大的设备时，它每单位产出的成本会更低，这主要是因为面积与体积的关系。当你将某个东西的体积翻倍时，你所需的外壳表面积增加不到一倍，无论是储罐还是管道之类的。所以，像化学加工设备或发电厂设备，每单位产出的成本往往会降低，直到某个点，最终你会遇到困难，这些缩放定律就不再适用了。嗯，这也是20世纪大部分时间里发电厂和电力变得更便宜的一个原因，因为我们建造的发电厂物理尺寸越来越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So so I talk about economies of of scale in the book and we're talking about like nuclear stuff. There's like kind of two related economies of scale that in some ways kind of pull in different directions. One is called and you see this with like other sort of processing equipment which is I call geometric scaling which is basically as you build a piece of equipment physically larger it costs less per unit of whatever it is in that you're producing basically because of like area volume relationships as you double the volume of something you less than double the amount of like surface area required to enclose it and be that like tanks or pipes or stuff like that. So like chemical processing equipment or like power plant equipment uh tends to get cheaper per unit of what you're producing up to a a certain point and eventually you run it gets you run into difficulties and those scaling laws stop working. Um and this is one reason why power plants you know and electricity got cheaper over sort of most of the course of the 20th century is because we're building these power plants physically larger.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，但对于核能，你会遇到围绕同样事情的非常糟糕的**规模不经济**（diseconomies of scale: 随着规模扩大，单位成本反而上升）。因为核电站越大，它们可能发生的事故就越危险。对于一个非常小的反应堆，你可以做到基本上不会发生熔毁。那里没有足够的热量来熔化你的容器或其他东西。嗯，但对于一个非常大的反应堆，热量会变得如此之大，你知道，它最终会导致事故的风险变得大得多，所以你必须拥有这些非常复杂的安全系统，而这些系统在较小的反应堆上可能不需要。所以，你知道，这可能指向一个原因，为什么这些小型模块化反应堆会更好。此外，正如你所说，现在你正在获得，你知道，系列生产的好处，而且，你知道，一遍又一遍地重复生产。嗯，但存在这种权衡，那就是你没有获得那些几何效应，而传统上很多这种加工型设备都依赖这些效应来降低成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but with nuclear you run into these very nasty uh disconomies of scale around the same thing which because as a nuclear plant gets bigger the accidents they could have get more dangerous for like a very small reactor you can't you can make it so you basically can't have a meltdown. There's just not enough heat in there to like melt through your container or or whatever. Um but for a very large one the heat gets so large of that you know it um it ends up being the the accidents become the risk becomes much much larger and so you have to have these like very involved safety systems that maybe you don't need to have on like a smaller reactor. So that's go you know that is something that maybe points to um points to a reason why these maybe small modular reactors were better. Plus, as you say, now you're getting it's sort of the benefits of like getting Yeah. series production uh and you know, repeating it over and over and over again. Um but there is that trade-off is that you're not getting those geometric effects that traditionally like a lot of this like processing type equipment has relied on to get cheaper.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这实际上让我想起了一个我想问的问题，不一定是关于核能的，而是关于一般制造业的。当我想到效率时，我想到的是像，你知道，尽可能降低成本，也许是**准时制库存管理**（just-in-time inventory management: 一种生产策略，旨在通过仅在需要时生产和交付产品来减少库存成本）之类的。问题是，如果出了问题，几乎没有缓冲来保护。我很好奇，在效率方面，人们如何在精简生产与建立冗余之间取得平衡，以防最坏的情况发生？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This actually reminds me of something I wanted to ask, not necessarily about nuclear, but just manufacturing in general. When I think about efficiencies, I think about stuff like, you know, reducing costs as much as as possible, maybe just in time inventory management and stuff like that. The problem is that if something goes wrong, there's very very little cushion for protection. And I'm curious when it comes to efficiency, how do people balance streamlining production with, I guess, building in redundancies in case the worst happens?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，这真的很有趣。嗯，我在书中大量谈到的**丰田生产系统**（Toyota Production System: 丰田汽车公司开发的一种生产管理哲学，旨在消除浪费、提高效率）或其衍生的**精益生产**（lean production: 一种通过消除浪费来最大化客户价值的生产方法）是一种有趣的平衡。因为每个人都认为，你知道，精益生产或丰田生产系统，就像“哦，是的，准时制，摆脱库存，你没有所有这些成本，你知道，你的工厂可以更小，等等等等。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's that's really interesting. And um I the Toyota production system slash lean which is like a descendant of it which I talk a lot about in in the book um is kind of an interesting balance of of these two things because everybody thinks you know lean or to production system it's like oh yeah just in time get rid of inventories you don't have all the costs you know your factories can be smaller blah blah blah.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，但实际上，它是一种平衡，即对于你能控制的每一个因素，尽量让流程尽可能顺畅，并消除系统中所有这些，你知道，松弛和浪费。但对于你无法控制的事情，你的系统应该具有适应性，以适应这些情况，并内置一定的灵活性。所以，一个例子是，嗯，在，你知道，回到核能，我相信在日本**福岛核事故**（Fukushima nuclear accident: 2011年日本地震和海啸引发的核电站事故）之后，丰田汽车曾一度面临汽车半导体短缺的问题，他们意识到这可能是一个巨大的瓶颈。所以在那次事故之后，尽管他们非常专注于库存最小化等等，但他们基本上决定储备某些关键物品，这些物品可能，你知道，交货期困难或其他什么。所以他们储备了汽车半导体。嗯，所以在新冠疫情期间，当突然出现汽车半导体严重短缺时，丰田汽车在一段时间内受到的影响比其他汽车制造商要小得多，因为他们吸取了教训，哦，是的，在，你知道，物流战壕中，这些半导体可能很难获得。所以，你知道，基本上人们都在说：“嘿，我以为你们都是关于库存最小化之类的。”但后来有人，你知道，一位发言人基本上回应说：“不，这基本上是一个标准的精益解决方案，它，你知道，你试图处理，你试图，你知道，最小化在你能控制的领域中的浪费，但在你无法控制的事情上，你需要调整你的系统来适应它。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but really what it is it's sort of a it's sort of a balance of like for every factor that you can control try to like have like the you know the flow be like as smooth as possible and a minute you know eliminate all this like you know slack and waste in the system but for the things that like you can't control you should have your system adaptable to sort of you know accommodate that and be have sort of a flexibility built into it. So like one example is um uh after the sort of you know to bring it back to nuclear after I believe the sort of Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, Toyota had a uh it ran into like a shortage of like automotive semiconductors for a while and they realized that this was like a big like potential like just bottleneck in their process. So after that they even though they're like so focused on you know inventory minimization and whatever after that accident they um basically decided they were going to like stockpile certain critical things that maybe you know had diff you know difficult lead times or or something like that. And so they stockpiled like ser automotive semiconductors. Um, and so during COVID when all of a sudden these like you know there was all of a sudden a huge like shortage of like automotive semiconductors, Toyota for a while was like much less affected by some of these other these other car manufacturers because they had learned the lesson that oh yeah in sort of you know logistics trenches these semiconductors can be quite difficult to get. And so, you know, basically people were saying, "Hey, I thought you were all about like inventory minimization or whatever." But then somebody, you know, some spokesman basically responded like, "No, this is basically a standard lean solution where it's um, you know, you try to deal, you try to, you know, minimize the things, you know, the sort of waste in the sort of areas that you can control, but in the stuff that you can't control, you need to sort of adapt your system to accommodate it."</p>

**Joe:** 美国似乎已经明白了，因为我试图从大局上理解这个国家各种事物的发展轨迹。你知道，我一开始开玩笑说，住房问题在于我们还没有找到将其**离岸外包**给中国的方法。如果我们做到了，那么住房成本可能会像我们在中国制造的其他所有商品一样变得更便宜。但我很好奇，你有没有一个理论，因为我还没有听到一个令人满意的答案，为什么美国在飞机制造方面似乎退步了。比如，为什么**波音**（Boeing: 美国航空航天公司，主要生产民用和军用飞机）在建造飞机方面似乎不如20年前了？

**Brian Potter:** 哦，是的，这很有趣。关于你提到的在中国建造房屋。实际上确实有一些公司尝试在中国做这件事。他们会制造这些模块，但正如我所说，你会产生所有这些额外成本，你知道，你必须把它们拆分成模块，装上船运过来。所以，你知道，这是一种非常小众的业务。嗯，就波音而言，我的意思是，标准的说法是，你知道，他们与**麦道**（McDonnell Douglas: 曾是美国航空航天制造商，后被波音收购）合并，那些财务人员。

**Brian Potter:** 是的。我的意思是，你知道，很大一部分原因就是制造商用飞机极其困难。你知道，现在世界上只有两家，也许三家，也许四家公司能做到。**波音**、**空客**（Airbus: 欧洲航空航天制造商，波音的主要竞争对手）、巴西的**巴西航空工业公司**（Embraer: 巴西的航空航天公司），然后**中国商飞**（Comac: 中国的国有航空航天制造商）看起来将成为第四大公司。你知道，日本多年来一直试图打入商用飞机制造市场，但他们基本上，你知道，在花费了数十亿美元之后，他们基本上放弃了，仅仅是因为它太困难了。在1970年代，曾经有更多的竞争对手，但他们一个接一个地被淘汰，你知道，一两个飞机项目没有成功，你就基本上破产了。**洛克希德**（Lockheed: 曾是美国航空航天公司，后合并为洛克希德·马丁）基本上就是这样。嗯，所以这是一个非常非常困难的行业。所以波音现在面临很多困境。嗯，但你知道，在21世纪早期，空客也面临很多困境。他们遇到了各种各样的问题。嗯，我想他们在推出**A380**（Airbus A380: 空客公司生产的超大型双层客机）时，也遇到了很多延误和需要解决的问题。所以，很大一部分原因就是这是一个非常困难的行业。很少有人能真正有效地做到这一点。

There used to be many more competitors in the 1970s and they sort of got winnowed down one by one, you know, one or two pro, you know, plane projects that don't pan out and you're basically out of out of business. That's essentially what happened to Lockheed. Um and so it's just a very very difficult business to sort of be in. And so Boeing is having a lot of struggles right now. Um but you know earlier in the 20th 21st century you have Airbus having a lot of struggles. They had all sorts of problems. Um I think on their uh A380 that they were rolling out they had like a lot of delays and stuff they had to fix on it as well. So a big part of it is just it's a very difficult business to to to be in. there's very few people that can kind of really do it effectively.</p>

**Tracy:** 我一直在思考一个问题，也许它与飞机有关，也许与住房有关，也许与其他事物有关。比如，当我们看到我们倒退或停滞不前时，我的问题是。我们是否患上了某种**荷兰病**（Dutch disease: 指一个国家因某种自然资源或特定产业的繁荣，导致其他产业衰退的现象）？比如在20世纪中期，在华盛顿某地的波音工厂里，有很多人在车间工作或在管理层工作，他们非常精明，非常，嗯，无论如何，而现在在2025年，同样的人可以在硅谷的初创公司或华尔街等地工作，赚取10倍的钱。是否存在某种程度的意识、技能或能动性等等？因为我们有其他领域有如此多的资金，所以有一种人，他们以前可能在建筑相关领域工作，但现在离开了那个领域，这改变了人才的分布。

<p class="english-text">Here's a question that I've wondered about and maybe it relates to planes and maybe it relates to housing, maybe it relates to other things. Like if when you see us going backwards or stalling out like here's my question. Could we have some sort of I don't know if Dutch disease is the right answer where it's like maybe in the middle of the 20th century there were people who were really you know working on the floor or working in management at Boeing in a plant somewhere in Washington who are really on the ball and really um whatever and now in that same person in 2025 could make 10 times as much money working for a startup in Silicon Valley or Wall Street etc that there's some sort of like levels of you awareness or skill or agenticness or whatever, etc. And that because we have these other areas where there's so much money that there's like a type of individual who used to maybe work in a sort of construction related field that left that and then it's changed the talent distribution with</p>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，我认为这绝对是其中一部分。在某些圈子里有一种理论，认为我们在某种意义上在高效分配人才方面做得太好了。所以，像一个极其有才华和聪明的人，我们会说：“好的，我们会让你成为一名软件开发人员或AI程序员，或者在金融领域工作等等。”你知道，你可以在那里贡献的价值会得到非常高的回报，但这意味着，你知道，进入其他工程学科的人就少了。我曾是一名结构工程师，你知道，这还不错，但薪水不如硅谷的软件开发人员。我以前常常告诉非常年轻的工程师或正在大学里考虑的工程师，你知道，如果你聪明到可以成为一名结构工程师，那么你聪明到可以转行做软件开发，赚更多的钱，而且工作压力小得多。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's definitely part of it. There's like a you know theory in certain circles that we've just we've gotten like in a sense too good at like allocating talent efficiently or whatever. So like somebody extremely like talented and smart it's like okay we're going to send you to be a software developer or an AI programmer or work in finance or whatever and you're you know there's going to be you're the value that you can contribute there is going to be very highly rewarded but what that means is like there's you know there's fewer people going into sort of these other um other sort of you know engineering disciplines. I worked as a structural engineer and which and it which is you know it plays reasonably well but doesn't you know not you know Silicon Valley software developer salary and I used to sort of tell very young engineers or engineers thinking about uh you know in in college or whatever I used to say you know if you're smart enough to be a structural engineer you're smart enough to you know switch to like software software development and make a lot more money and have a much less stressful job.</p>

We're making more steel than anybody else. The US was like, you know, the China of today. It was like the by far the largest manufacturing country in the world. And so we just had the ability to sort of redirect this um manufacturing capability and talent into sort of these these new industries. I think that was a very large part of it.

**Tracy:** 中国，是否可以有不止一个全球制造中心？因为当你考虑到规模经济和**网络效应**（network effects: 产品或服务的价值随着用户数量增加而增加的现象）时，你知道，就像美国有多少其他城市试图成为旧金山或硅谷，但它们从未真正复制成功。当你考虑到**集聚效应**（agglomeration: 产业或人口在特定地理区域集中）和网络效应等等时，当你考虑到制造业所需的东西时，你就会想到，好的，现在在21世纪，中国是21世纪的中国，你再想到美国**再工业化**（re-industrialization: 重新发展工业，通常指将制造业从海外迁回国内）的努力，因为有所有这些关于我们无法建造先进产品的焦虑，就像，如果我们不也做洗衣机等简单产品，我们还能拥有先进产品吗？在任何特定时间，世界上可以有不止一个吗？还是市场逻辑决定了一个会成为主导力量？

<p class="english-text">The China could there be more than one global manufacturing hub? Because when you think about economies of scale and you think about network effects, you know, it's like how many other cities in the US have tried to be the San Francisco or the Silicon Valley and they've never you really never replicate it. When you think about sort of elomeration and network effects, etc., And you think about what it takes for manufacturing and you think about okay now in the 21st century China is the China of the 21st century and you think about the efforts at US sort of re-industrialization because there's all this angst about whatever we can't build advanced things it's like well can we have advanced things if we don't also do the simple things like washing machines etc like can there be more than one in the world at any given time or does market logic sort of dictate that one will be the powerhouse</p>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，这是一个非常有趣的问题，所以我的第一个答案是我不知道，第二个答案是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah that's a really interesting question and so my my first answer is that I don't know and and the the second answer is</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 我认为从历史上看，你看到的是运输成本在某种程度上一直是阻止一个国家主导某种产品生产的障碍。所以即使在80年代和90年代，当日本汽车制造商击败美国时，从日本运输它们仍然非常昂贵，以至于他们仍然觉得在美国设立本地制造业务是有价值的。他们仍然想在美国建造他们的工厂，以降低运输这些东西的成本。嗯，所以我想知道，随着运输变得越来越便宜，这是否改变了这种逻辑，你是否可以以一种以前可能不太合理的方式实现生产集中。我不知道。但这是一个有趣的思考方式，一个有趣的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think historically kind of what you see is that like transportation costs have kind of been a you know something of a barrier to uh preventing one uh country from like just dominating production of a certain thing. So even like when you know in the in the 80s and 90s when Japanese like car manufacturers were like trouncing the US, it it was still so expensive to like ship them from Japan or whatever that you you know they still it was still valuable to like set up local manufacturing operations um in in the US. They still wanted to build their plants in in in the US to sort of make it not so expensive to sort of transport these things. Um, so I wonder if like as transport, you know, transportation has gotten more and more inexpensive, I wonder if that has like shifted the logic of this and you can have this sort of like concentration of production in a way that maybe it wasn't quite didn't quite make sense to do uh before when like these transportation costs bit a little bit harder. I don't know. But it's an interesting way of interesting question.</p>

**Joe:** 嗯，回到波音一秒钟。我们谈到了波音出问题的经典故事，那就是地面制造商和董事会高管之间的紧张关系，后者试图削减成本，提高股价等等。这是一种趋势吗？或者说，你在制造业中普遍看到这种现象，即制造商不断受到来自高层财务高管的压力？或者是否存在一些公司已经解决了这种关系，财务和制造商工程师能够协同工作？

<p class="english-text">Uh, just going back to Boeing for a second. So, we talked about the classic story of what went wrong at Boeing and it's that tension between I guess the manufacturers on the ground and the executives in the boardroom who are trying to cut costs and boost the share price and things like that. Is that is that like a trend or a thing that you tend to see across manufacturing where the manufacturers are constantly under pressure from the finance execs on the top or are there companies out there who have like cracked that relationship where finance and manufacturers engineers kind of work together?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的。嗯，我认为，你知道，这种压力似乎确实是，你知道，不断推动寻找更低的成本。嗯，这也是为什么，你知道，20世纪下半叶的趋势是外包，寻找新的地方来制造这些更便宜的东西。我在书中谈到了**耐克**（Nike: 美国著名运动品牌），耐克走了一条有趣的道路，它不断寻找最便宜的劳动力来源。他们一开始在某个便宜的地方制造，对吧？他们一开始在日本制造鞋子，因为在那里制造比在美国便宜得多。但随着日本劳动力变得越来越贵，他们将制造业转移到台湾，然后从台湾转移到中国。我想现在几乎所有的生产都在越南和印度尼西亚完成。所以，这只是不断寻找新的劳动力来源，你在各行各业都广泛看到这种现象，比如纽约，它曾经是服装制造中心，但随着纽约劳动力变得越来越贵，他们将生产转移到，你知道，首先是州外的新泽西，然后到南方，然后到海外。所以这种压力是持续存在的。但也有一些公司，我认为它们逆势而上，它们更像是：“我们认为投资于我们的劳动力及其能力所带来的回报将足够有价值，所以我们会这样做。”我认为，你知道，像**纽柯**（Nucor: 美国一家大型钢铁公司）这样的公司，它是美国的一家钢铁公司，它在投资于劳动力等方面非常有名，而且他们在这方面取得了巨大的成功。他们从无到有，发展成为美国最大的钢铁制造商，我相信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um I think you know the the pressure definitely seems to be you know constant pushing to find uh you know lower sort you know lower costs. Um and which is one reason why you know the trend in the second half of the 20th century was like just outsourcing finding new places to sort of make this stuff that is uh you know cheaper. I talk about a Nike in the book and there's sort of an interesting path that Nike takes where it's like constantly hunting the the cheapest sources of labor where they start out they start out manufacturing somewhere cheap, right? They start out manufacturing their shoes in Japan because it's much cheaper to make them there than in uh than in the US. But then as Japanese labor starts getting more expensive, they move their manufacturing to uh Taiwan and then from Taiwan to China. And I think now it's almost all done in like a Vietnam and Indonesia. So it's just constant hunt for the new sources of labor and you see that just broadly across industries like um where New York which used to be sort of a uh you know a garment manufacturing center but as New York labor got more and more expensive they moved you know AC first you know out of state into New Jersey and then to the south and then over o overseas. So there's this constant pressure. But then there's also companies that have like I think bucked that trend and been you know more like we think the returns from like investing in our workforce and its capabilities um is going to be valuable enough that we're going to do it. I think you know a company like Newor which is a steel company in the US which is like very sort of famous in terms of like how it invests in its workforce and things like that and they've been extremely successful in doing that. They grew from nothing to being the the largest steel manufacturer in the US I believe.</p>

**Brian Potter:** 哦，好问题。我只是觉得，你知道，在20世纪早期，19世纪后期，嗯，这些东西代表着工业实力和成功的国家。嗯，然后他们从未摆脱那种框架。所以，对，你知道，苏联的一个批评是，你知道，他们可能非常擅长建造这些工业产品，但他们从未成功建造出像样的计算机或类似的东西。他们无法摆脱他们的思维定式。衡量成功，你知道，以产出或其他什么来衡量，可能相对容易。这是一种相对简单的商品，你可以，你知道。

Um and then they never kind of like got out of that uh sort of framework or whatever. So like one criticism of I you know the Soviet Union um was that you know they were really maybe good at sort of building these like industrial things but they never managed to build like a successful computer or anything like that.

### 传统住房建设的停滞与未来展望

**Tracy:** 让我们回到住房问题，因为当我们开始时，Tracy 谈到，即使抛开预制建筑不谈，你谈到的实际的、现场的、一次性的房屋建造，可以说，在某些衡量标准下，生产力已经倒退了，或者可能持平。抛开预制建筑不谈，你提到了分区规划、法规等等。你认为为什么普通的住房建设方式多年来没有变得更有效率？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get back to housing because when we started and Tracy was talking about the fact that even setting aside the prefab stuff and you're talking about it the actual on the ground oneoff etc home building it's arguably uh uh by some measures productivity has gone backwards or maybe it's flat. setting aside like prefab, you mentioned zoning regulations, etc. What is your view for why just the normal sort of style of housing construction hasn't gotten any more efficient over the years?</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的。所以我在书中谈到了这一点。这与本书的主要论点有关，我将任何过程可以使其更便宜的特定干预点分解开来。我之前已经谈到过一些。嗯，你知道，**规模经济**，你可以生产更多的产品。嗯，你可以引入一些根本性的新技术。你知道，一个例子是，谈到钢铁，最好的**贝塞麦转炉炼钢法**（Bessemer process: 一种在19世纪中叶发明的炼钢方法，通过向熔融生铁中吹入空气来去除杂质，从而大规模生产钢材），它从根本上比之前的工艺更简单，所需的投入更少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so I I I talk about the kind of this in the book. This goes to sort of the this main thesis of the book where I sort of break down there's a specific points of intervention that you can do in any process to to make it cheaper. I've talked about these a little bit. Um you know, economies of scale, you can make more of of what you're doing. Um, you can introduce some like fundamental new technology. You know, an example of this to talk about steel, like the best summer process for making steel, which like fundamentally was simpler and took less inputs than the processes that that came before it.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 嗯，所以我在书中分解了这些不同的因素，比如你需要做什么才能使某个过程更有效率。如果你能做到这些，你的过程就会变得更便宜，你就可以以更低的价格出售。嗯，如果你不能做到这些，如果你，你知道，你不能使过程变得更便宜。而所有这些基本上通向改进的路径，在建筑业中要么被阻碍，要么非常难以实现。所以，就像我们谈到的规模经济，嗯，你知道，这是一个很大的因素。我们谈到了一点**风险规避**（risk aversion: 倾向于避免风险，即使可能获得更高的回报）。很难引入根本性的新技术。嗯，你的投入成本是一个很大的因素。你知道，你在过程中使用的材料、能源和劳动力。这些成本在建筑业中很难降低。很难使建筑材料比它们现在更便宜，以每磅多少美元或每立方英尺多少美元来衡量。嗯，它们基本上是文明所生产的任何东西中最便宜的。要使这些东西比它们现在更便宜并不容易。也很难在不降低房屋质量的情况下减少它们的使用量。所以所有这些路径，你知道，一个过程可以利用这些路径来降低成本。嗯，它们在建筑业中都非常难以实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so I kind of break down these different factors in the book of like what you need to do um to make some process more efficient. And if you can do those things, your process can get cheaper and you can sell it for less. Um, and if you can't do those things, you're if you know, you can't make the process any cheaper. And all those basically paths uh to improvement are either like blocked or like very difficult to do in construction. So like we talked about economies of scale uh you know that's a big one. We talked a little bit about risk aversion. It's hard to kind of introduce like fundamentally new technology. Uh the cost of your inputs is like a big one. you know, the the the materials and sort of energy and and and labor that you're using uh in the process. Those costs are hard to sort of reduce in construction. Sort of it's very hard to make building materials any cheaper than they already are and kind of in like you know dollars per pound or dollars per like cubic foot terms. Uh they're basically as cheap as anything that civilization produces. It's not easy to make those things cheaper than they already are. It's also hard to use less of them in a way that doesn't make the house worse. And so all these paths are that you have, you know, that a process can take advantage of to sort of get less expensive. Uh they're all very uh difficult to do in construction.</p>

**Joe:** 我刚想起了另一个我一直想问别人的问题，我觉得你也会知道这个问题的答案，那就是为什么美国用木框架和木材建造房屋，而世界其他地方倾向于使用更多的水泥和混凝土。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just remembered another question that I always want to ask people and I feel like you will also know the answer to this one which is why does America build houses out of uh wood frames and timber versus the rest of the world where they tend to use a lot more cement and concrete.</p>
</details>

**Brian Potter:** 是的。所以木材，你知道，美国历史上建造了很多木结构的东西，因为我们有大量的木材供应。嗯，在欧洲等地，很多那些，你知道，大森林很早就被砍伐了。所以他们就没有像美国那样大量的木材供应。所以这在某种程度上塑造了技术的发展方式，因为木材非常非常便宜。你可以使用它。嗯，这是一种非常便宜的建造房屋的方式。嗯，他们实际上在世界其他地方仍然进行木框架建筑。可能没有那么普遍，但它在，你知道，英国、德国都有使用。德国实际上有一些预制建筑初创公司，它们使用木框架木板建筑。它在很多北欧国家都有使用，这些国家有相当数量的木材供应。所以这并不是闻所未闻。它在美国和加拿大最为普遍，但在其他有相当数量木材的地方，他们也倾向于使用它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So the wood you know uh US has historically built a lot of stuff out of wood because we had such huge supplies of it. Uh in places like Europe, a lot of those uh you know large forests got cut down way earlier. And so they just didn't have the huge huge supplies of uh of wood that uh that the US had. And so that kind of you know shaped how the technology developed because wood is very very inexpensive. You can use it. Um it's a very inexpensive way to sort of uh build a house. Um they do actually do sort of still timber frame construction in uh in other parts of the world. It's maybe not quite so dominant, but it's like used in uh you know the UK, Germany uses it. Germany actually they have some like prefab construction startups that are made using like timber frame timber panel construction. It's used in a lot of the Nordic countries uh that have a decent amount of supply of wood. So it's not like unheard of. It's it's most dominant in like the US and in Canada, but in other places that have a decent amount of wood, they tend to use it as well.</p>

**Brian Potter:** 是的，所以他们，是的，他们筹集了巨额资金。嗯，是的，他们在筹集了几十亿美元并建造了所有这些工厂来大规模生产房屋之后，嗯，他们基本上最终破产了，部分原因是因为他们从未能够出售足够多的他们试图出售的建筑物。当你投资了所有这些物理基础设施时，很难调整你的运营。嗯，然后新冠疫情，你知道，是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。嗯，我并没有完全悲观。我主要只是认为，如果你想通过预制建筑来改变这个行业，你需要有一个非常强有力的论点，说明这次具体有什么不同，以及为什么以前没有成功，现在又有什么改变，哪些限制已经放宽，嗯，这将使现在成为可能。我没有，你知道，任何数量的事情都可能改变，你知道，某些材料变得足够便宜，嗯，建造工厂变得足够便宜，你知道，任何数量的事情。嗯，我个人认为，嗯，非常非常好的自动化和机器人技术很有可能改变这一点，仅仅是因为，你知道，即使其他什么都不奏效，你知道，我不是世界上最有创造力的人。你知道，我不能想出一些惊人的新方法来建造房屋。嗯，但即使其他什么都不奏效，如果你有一个5000美元的机器人，并且它基本上可以复制一个人90%到95%的工作，那将有效地解决你的问题，对吧？你投入这些机器人，嗯，然后你建造，你知道，无论你试图建造什么，都使用这种机器人，成本低得多的劳动力。嗯，我在书的结论中有一个小插曲，描述了未来可能的样子。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, so they Yeah, they raised a huge amount of money. Uh yeah, and they basically after raising like several billion dollars and building all these factories to like f you know, massproduce housing, uh they basically ended up uh going bankrupt part, you know, partly because they were never able to, you know, sell enough of these, you know, buildings that they were trying to sell. It's very hard to like pivot your operations when you're like invested in all this like physical infrastructure. Um and then COVID, you know, was kind of the final nail in the coffin. Uh I'm not totally, you know, I'm not completely pessimistic. I mostly just think if you're gonna sort of try to change the industry with with with prefab, you need to have a very strong thesis as to what specifically this time is different and you know why it didn't work previously and what is now has changed what constraints have been relaxed um that uh will make it possible now and I don't have an you know any number of things could change that you know certain materials get cheap enough uh it gets like inexpensive enough to build a factory you know any number of things uh I personally Personally, I think that uh very very good, you know, automation and robotics have a good chance of of changing this just because, you know, even if nothing else work, you know, I'm not the most creative person in the world. You know, I can't necessarily come up with like some amazing new way of putting a house together. Um, but if even if nothing else works, if you have like a robot that costs $5,000 and like basically duplicate, you know, 90 95% of what a person can do, that would effectively solve your problem, right? you drop in these robots, um, and you build, you know, whatever it is that you're trying to build using this robotic, much less expensive labor.

<p class="english-text">Um I did read apparently his new book, The Origins of Efficiency, has a bibliography that's like 600 items long. Amazing.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这真是令人难以置信，想到他翻阅了600种不同的参考资料。我们在这段对话中没有深入探讨，但他之前写过他的研究过程，比如，好的，我想了解一些新的行业，比如战斗机或其他什么，以及他是如何深入研究的等等。是的，看起来。

<p class="english-text">Which is incredible um to think about him pouring over like 600 different reference sources. We didn't get into it in this conversation, but he's written about his process before of like, okay, I want to learn about some new industry like fighter jets or whatever it is and how he goes about um diving into it, etc. And yes, it seems like</p>

**Joe:** 谈论这些事情的人，我可能应该读一下。

<p class="english-text">People who talk about stuff I should probably read that.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的，完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, totally.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，说到这个，我为我们在这段关于住房生产力、住房建设生产力的对话中完全没有提到“**平减指数**”（deflator: 经济学中用于衡量价格水平变化的指数）这个词而感到非常自豪。我应该提一下我在开场白中谈到的那份里士满联储的报告。所以，他们的结论是我们在这次对话中谈到的所有因素的综合。所以，他们基本上说。

<p class="english-text">Um, speaking of which, I am very proud of us for not mentioning the word deflator at all in a conversation about housing productivity, housing construction productivity. I should just mention that Richmond Fed paper that I talked about in the intro. So, their conclusion was sort of an amalgamation of all the factors that we talked about um in this conversation. So, they basically said</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 他们认为小型建筑公司投资技术创新的激励减少了，因为你无法获得规模经济。事实上，如果你看看那些**分区规划**（zoning laws: 地方政府对土地用途和建筑类型设定的规定）更严格的地区，你会发现它们的建筑生产力甚至比其他地区更低，同样是因为激励和规模经济不断缩小。所以这很有趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">They think that smaller construction firms have reduced incentives to invest in technological innovation because you don't get that economy of scale. And in fact, if you look at areas with uh stricter zoning laws and things like that, you can see that they actually have even less construction productivity than other areas again because like the incentives and the economies of scale just shrink and shrink and shrink. So that's kind of interesting.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那会很有趣。嗯，我当时有点好奇的是，我想知道如果你只看一个非常平坦干燥的市场。我当时在想亚利桑那州之类的。比如，他们在那里看到生产力提升了吗？特别是考虑到我们与 J. Chase Emerson 的一些对话，那里有一个总体规划，有很多房子，我们都开车经过它们，它们看起来都一模一样。你至少在某种有限的程度上获得了**学习曲线**（learning curves: 随着经验的积累，生产效率提高，单位成本下降）吗？我对此很好奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It would be interesting. Um something I was sort of curious about during that is I wonder if if you just look at one market where it's very flat and dry. I was thinking about Arizona or something like that. Like have they seen productivity gains there? Especially thinking about some of our conversations with J say Chase Emerson where okay there's there's one master plan and a bunch of houses we all driven by them that all look exactly the same. Do you get those learning curves at least on some limited effect? I would be curious about that.</p>

**Tracy:** 我觉得在某种程度上，这就是**阳光地带**（sunbelt states: 美国南部和西南部气候温暖的州份）各州的故事，对吧？那里的房价更便宜，因为你可以有这些大型开发项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel like to some extent that is the story of the sunb belt states right you have cheaper houses there because you can have these big developments</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 但规模大大缩小了。所以我喜欢他提出的观点，即你可以识别效率提升的来源。规模是一个，像钢铁的**贝塞麦转炉炼钢法**这样的科学突破是另一个，等等。但它们不会，它们不是魔法，对吧？它们不会凭空出现。你知道，你可能会从，你知道，可重复的过程或随着时间推移变得更好的销售劳动力中获得一些效率提升，但总的来说，你不会，万灵药不会凭空出现。特别是存在所有这些非常根本的原因，为什么你不能拥有规模，甚至建造预制房屋的工厂也不能是**超级工厂**，因为分销成本。你就会明白为什么会遇到这种限制。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But it's scale it's scale way down. And so I like that point that he made which is that you can identify the sources of efficiency gains. Scale is one, a scientific breakthrough such as the best of our process in steel is another one, etc. But they're not going to they're not magic, right? They're not just going to emerge. you know, you probably get some some efficiency gain just from, you know, repeatable process or a sales labor force that gets better over time, but by and large, you're not just going to the silver bullet isn't going to come out of nowhere. And especially the fact that there are all these sort of very fundamental reasons why you can't have scale or even the factories that build the prefab homes cannot be a gigafactory due to distribution cost. You see why that you run into that constraint.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我当时就是这么想的。这就像**物理学的暴政**（tyranny of physics: 指物理定律对技术和工程的根本限制）。基本上，即使我们有所有这些技术突破，运输成本随着时间推移变得更便宜。你仍然受到地理和，你知道，现实世界物体的限制。我想这就是为什么你可以为芯片这样的东西建造**超级工厂**，它们非常容易运往国外，它们很小，但你不能为大型物体这样做。我真的，我很好奇关于人才分配的观点，以及在1950年代。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That's what I was thinking. It's like the tyranny of of physics basically. Like even though we have all these technological breakthroughs, transportation has gotten cheaper over time. You're still limited by geography and the realities of, you know, real world objects. And I guess that's why you can have gigafactories for something like chips, which are really easy to send abroad. They're tiny, but you can't do it for something large. And I really am I I curious about the sort of the point about talent distribution and whether there you know in the 1950s</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 对于某种类型的人才，波音工厂是他们最好的去处，那是前沿，而现在波音工厂或多或少仍然像1950年代的波音工厂，薪资水平可能也差不多。我确信名义工资上涨了很多，但现在有太多更好的机会可以赚取10倍甚至更多的钱。所以，剩下的人才，无论是，你知道，这是否会影响它的运营效率，我对此非常感兴趣。

<p class="english-text">The the for a certain type of uh talent the the Boeing factory was the best place they could have gone the cutting edge and that was the cutting edge and now the Boeing factory still more or less resembles the Boeing factory of the 1950s with maybe similar pay scales rel it's and so forth. I'm sure the nominal pay has gone up a lot, but there are just so many great opportunities to make 10 times or much more money elsewhere. And so that the sort of remaining talent, whether there's some, you know, whether that has an effect on how well it can operate, I'm very interested in.</p>

**Joe:** 你知道波音需要什么吗？

**Joe:** 他们需要一部像**《广告狂人》**（Mad Men: 一部关于20世纪60年代纽约广告业的美国电视剧）那样的电视剧，来美化飞机制造过程，让人们再次对它感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They need like a Madmen style TV series that glamorizes the aircraft manufacturing process and gets people interested in it again.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。不，那真是个好主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, that's a really good idea.</p>

**Joe:** 好的。这是给波音的一个免费主意。我们到此为止吗？
