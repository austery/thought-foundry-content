title: 斯多葛主义的深层误解与现代重构：超越表象的智慧
summary: 本文深入探讨了关于斯多葛主义的常见误解，如将其视为消极避世、情感压抑或仅为应对逆境的工具。作者Massimo Pigliucci阐释了真正的斯多葛哲学是关于理性决策、品格培养和积极参与社会。文章还讨论了斯多葛主义在动荡时代的复兴原因，并强调其开放性与适应性，尤其是在现代科学背景下对古代形而上学概念的修正，以实现其在21世纪的持续相关性。

### 斯多葛主义的本真与误读

关于**斯多葛主义**（Stoicism: 一种古希腊哲学，强调美德、理性和与自然和谐相处）存在诸多误解，例如将其简单地视为培养超然态度、使人变得顺从、或是一种消极避世、不作为、与世隔绝的哲学。然而，这仅仅是“小写s”的斯多葛主义，而非真正“大写S”的哲学本身。正如进化生物学家兼科学哲学家**Massimo Pigliucci**在其与Greg Lopez和Mered Kuns合著的《超越斯多葛主义》一书中所揭示的，这些误解需要被澄清。

理解斯多葛主义的本质并非易事，正如对基督教或佛教等其他哲学和宗教的解释也存在分歧一样。事实上，不同的基督教和佛教流派正是对古代文本的不同解读和在21世纪的更新。斯多葛主义亦是如此，这种内部争议甚至可以追溯到其创始人**芝诺**（Zeno of Citium: 斯多葛学派的创始人）的学生时代。哲学本质上就包含着异议，这或许也是人类境况的本质。尽管如此，我们仍需谨慎对待所阅读和思考的内容，努力探究其真实含义，而非盲从某些人的片面解读。

misconception about stoicism is that it's about cultivating an attitude of detachment from things and people . It turns people into doormats . It's a quietest philosophy . It's about. N ot reacting . It's about not doing things and sort of isolate yourself from the rest of the world . But that's stoicism with the little S , which is not, in fact, what real stoicism with a capital as , toi cis m. The philosophy is about. I am, Masimo, Pel, Y uci . I am, an evolutionary biologist and a philosopher of S cien ce . And. My latest book is calledBeyond stoicism coauored with Greg Lopez and Mered Kuns . De bunking misconceptions about stoicism . P erh aps predictably. There is a lot of discussion and even a little bit of confusion about what Sttoiceism mean is and is not if you read a random writing about stoicism, or you listen to a random podcast about stoicism, you would hear things like, oh, don't don't go that way because that's not really sism me. It's there any fact to some extent I've done this as well. I think I have arguments for it. These arguments, I think are based on a good understanding of the philosophy as well as on the original texts ,. But I admit, there are different opinions. About. . T. He, nature of sto ism . This is not surprising . We. See the same thing in other philosophies and religion . There are different opinions about what Christianity is . There are different opinions about what Buddhism is . A nd ,. In fact, , arguably ,. There are different Christianityities and different B ud dhi sms , meaning that there are different ways to interpret what the ancient texts say, and also different ways to update those texts and those philosophies to the 21 st century . So. The same goes for stoicism . In fact , to some extent, ,. This has happened from the beginning . Y eah . O ne of the students of Zeena of S aiu m , who was the originator of stores, was the guy who actually started the store . One of his students is on record , disagreeing on some of the things that about some of the things that Zeino was saying . and starting his own thing . he went on on in a different direction . And. He started his own school. So. This has happened since the beginning . disagree agreementment is the nature of philosophy and possibly the nature of the human condition . Y eah . N everth ele ss ,. One needs to be cautious about what we read and how we think about things, because we need to make at least an honest concerted effort, if we're interested in a particular philosophy or religion to get to the bottom of what the thing is actually about and not what necessarily some people claim it is about.

### 斯多葛主义的时代回响与决策哲学

斯多葛主义的复兴并非偶然。一方面，它从未真正消失，其思想被早期教会父辈融入基督教，并在文艺复兴和启蒙运动中重新浮现。另一方面，近十到十五年间，对斯多葛主义感兴趣的人数显著增加。这背后的原因与它最初在**希腊化时期**（Hellenistic period: 古希腊历史上的一个时期，政治和社会变革剧烈）的繁荣如出一辙——我们正生活在一个动荡不安的时代。从20世纪的两次世界大战、核武器竞赛，到21世纪的气候变化，以及持续快速的政治和社会变迁，许多人感到迷茫和不安。斯多葛主义作为一种强调**韧性**（resilience: 面对挑战和挫折时恢复和适应的能力）和应对潜在挑战的哲学，其在此时的复兴显得合情合理。

然而，这种复兴也带来了一种新的误解：许多人认为斯多葛主义仅仅是应对挫折和挑战的补救措施。例如，在新冠疫情期间，许多人寻求斯多葛主义以应对困境。诚然，它在这方面非常有用，但我们不应忘记，斯多葛主义更是一种关于**决策**（Decision-making: 关于如何在生活中做出最佳选择的哲学）的哲学。无论顺境逆境，我们都需要做出最佳决策。即使在看似美好的时期，如事业成功或获得财富，也同样面临决策的必要性：如何投资？如何让这些变化更好地影响生活？这些问题并非总有显而易见的答案。因此，良好的决策能力在任何情况下都至关重要，斯多葛主义的价值也体现在生活的方方面面，而不仅仅是应对危机。

Stoicism at the moment is in resurgence. It's very popular for number of years. Now you will easily find new books and new articles and new podcasts and new . E says on stoysism as a practical philosophy, , and one might ask reasonably why stoicism all of a sudden . W ell ,. On the one hand, , stoicism really never went away . It is true that all of the eenistic philosophies . G radu ally disappeared from view between the third and the fourth century , essentially contemporaneously with the rise of Christianity and the two things artifact, in fact, more or less related . But it's also true that a lot of stoic ideas were, in fact, , incorporated into Christianity, and they were transmitted by the church , the early church fathers into the Middle Ages. Eventually, they reemerged as stoic ideas into the Renaissance and later on into the E, nme nt ,. And so the fact that today, we are talking about stoicism and people are practicing stoicism isn't really that surprising . On. The other hand, , it is certainly the case that the number of people who are interested in sism as searched dramatically over the last 10 to 15 years . and so it makes sense to ask ourselves. Well, why . O kay . P ossi bly. One of the answers is that we live in turbulent times, which are essentially the same kinds of times that led to the initial flourishing of stoicism, , stoicism flourished during the ellenistic period , which was a major period of lasting two or three centuries of political change, , social change. In fact, all of the so-called eenistic philosophies , not just stoicism , but also epicureanism , two different forms of skepticism and a number of others . W ere very popular and or arose at that time, , precisely because people were looking for answers, , people were looking for ways to navigate a rapidly changing world that was difficult to make sense of, and it was even more difficult to cope with . T oday , arguably since I would say, at least the 2 0t h century and certainly into the 21 st century ,. We live in a similar world , last century, we went through two world wars . T hen. We developed enough nuclear weapons to destroy the planet many times over , then near the end of the 2 0t h century and beginning of the 21 st. We started being more aware of yet another major challenge, which we referred to as climate change. N ot to mention , of course, , more local . in a national level or a regional level, , political change, , social change that keeps happening at a very high pace. And a lot of people are distraught by this ,. They don't know how to process this ,. They don't know what their place is going to be in a society that looks very different from not only the society of their parents and grandparents , but even the society that they experience as younger selves . So. It's not surprise that stoicism in particular , which is a philosophy after all of resilience and of coping with . Po tential challenges and potential drawbacks is having a moment of resurgence . I think it's perfectly reasonable . and fact, it's very useful . H owever , that does bring . P eople to a misunderstanding ,. A lot of people seem to think that that's what toy ism ,. That's all that syism me is ,. That is that stoyism is good only as a remedy toward setbacks and challenges ,. For instance, , Y eah . D uri ng, the recent COVID pandemic , I personally got a lot of calls from people of town, asking me about stoicism and say, , you know, can I use sicism to deal with the situation. And the answer was , of course, you can , but you also don't want to forget that . Y eah . We make decisions all the time in life throughout our lives , whether it's good times or bad times , whether it's a challenge or an opportunity ,. It doesn't matter . we still have to make the best decisions we can. And sism. In a sense, , is a philosophy about decision making about the best way to approach decision making . so it's just as useful in good times. So to speak, as it is in bad times , it's just that people tend to reach for it only when they are in distress. And then they become sort of a little bit relaxed, probably inappropriately relaxed , I should say, , when it comes to the good times , we don't we don't think that if we are. G oing through things that are positive , let's say, we come into ,. We have a good moment on our career or we come into some money or something that those are problems ,. But in fact, they are problems . B eca use. They also carry the necessity of decision making. If you came into some money , what are you going to do with that money? ,? How are you going to invest it ,? How are you going to ,? How is that going to change your life in for the better ,? It may not the answer to those questions may not be that obvious. And so good decision making is always useful, no matter what the situation positive or negative .

### 斯多葛主义的“硬汉”误区与美德的真义

当一种哲学或宗教变得流行时，不可避免地会出现对其原始思想的误解或扭曲，斯多葛主义也不例外。许多年轻人，尤其是男性，被他们所认为的斯多葛主义所吸引，因为它似乎验证了“强者”应沉默、控制情感的观念。然而，这正是“小写s”的斯多葛主义，即所谓的“硬汉态度”（stiff upper lip），强调情感压抑和刻板的生活方式，而非真正的斯多葛哲学。

当然，任何误解中都可能包含一丝真相。例如，“硬汉态度”源于**坚忍**（Endurance: 斯多葛主义的核心价值之一，指在无法改变的困境中保持坚韧）。斯多葛学派认为，如果某事无法改变，唯一的理性选择就是忍受，抱怨只会让情况更糟。但这并非等同于情感压抑。斯多葛学派强调**情绪调节**（Emotion Modulation: 通过理性对话和引导，将破坏性情绪转化为建设性力量），而非压抑。他们主张通过理性来转化愤怒，使其成为追求正义的积极力量，而不是破坏性的情绪。试图压抑情绪是不可能的，因为情绪是我们大脑运作的固有部分，强行压抑只会导致严重的心理问题。

然而，存在一种将斯多葛主义“兄弟化”（broification）的危险，这种解读往往强调男性气质，塑造出一种神话般的、不为外界所动的“硬汉”形象。例如，有人错误地认为“美德”（virtue）一词源于拉丁语“vir”（意为“男人”），从而推断斯多葛主义是关于“男子气概”的哲学。但这种观点忽视了一个关键点：拉丁语的“virtus”实际上是希腊语“**arete**”（Excellence: 意为卓越或尽力做到最好，是中性词）的翻译。**arete**是中性词，与性别无关，仅指尽力做到最好。因此，从词源学和历史层面看，这种“硬汉”解读都是肤浅且具有潜在危害的。

古代斯多葛学派明确反对这种“硬汉”观念。他们是古希腊罗马哲学家中少数明确指出女性与男性一样是理性人，同样有能力理解和实践哲学的人。**爱比克泰德**（Epictetus: 古希腊斯多葛派哲学家）和**塞涅卡**（Seneca: 罗马斯多葛派哲学家、剧作家、政治家）在多处著作中都清楚地表达了这一点。此外，斯多葛学派所实践的诸多美德中，**正义**（Justice: 斯多葛主义的核心美德之一，指以尊严和尊重对待所有人，不分性别、种族、国籍等）是核心。这意味着无论性别、种族、国籍、民族或宗教，都应以尊严和尊重对待他人，正如你希望被对待一样。这显然与任何“硬汉”式的处事方式无关。

W hen ever a philosophy or effect fact , even a religion becomes popular ,. Inevitably, there are people who are going to use it in a way that . E ss enti ally is a misunderstanding of the original idea or a significant distortion of the original idea . This is happening, not surprisingly, also with stoicism ,. There's a number of people , especially certain kind of young man who are attracted to what they think of as stoicism, because it validates their notion that a a good person, , a strong person. , particularly strong man, is somebody who is silent, who controls their emotions and so on and so forth. , but that's stoicism with the little S is the stoic attitude , the stiff upper lip , the suppression of emotion , the sp approach to life , which is not, in fact, what real stoicism with a capital as , stoicism ,. The philosophy is about Of course . L ike, any misconception , there is a grainer truth . The stiff upper lip ,. For instance, , comes from the fact that . E nura nce is in fairas stoic value ,. The stoics would say, look, if something is going to happen to you that you cannot do anything about , then your only choice is really your only irrational choice is to endure it ,. What are you going to do? You're either going to endure it or you're going to endure it and then complain about it, complaining doesn't really add anything. It only makes you feel worse, so just deal with it ,. Just endure it. B ut. That's not the same as a stiff upper lip because it's only a minor component of what stoic philosophy is about. T heno tion , the misgaid notion that stoicism is about suppressing. The emotions also comes from a distortion of a real aspect of stoic philosophy ,. The stoics make a big deal about the notion of talking to your emotions, , and modulating your emotions through reason, , for instance, , dealing with your anger , in a way that it's not anger anymore , but it becomes something healthy , something positive ,. For instance, , a sense of justice that you want to pursue instead of a destructive sense of anger . Y eah . T hat can also easily be misconstrued as suppressing emotions. ,. There is no such thing as suppressing emotions. ,. We cannot suppress emotions, because emotions are part and parcel. The way our brain works. The only way to suppress your emotions is to literally cut off a part of your brain, and that will turn you into a psychopath or otherwise, somebody who has a serious mental issues ,. You don't want to do that . T. He . H owever ,. There is a danger of what I sometimes refer to as the broification, as in bro of stoicism, , or this interpretation of stoicism that tends to be on the darker side of things, tends to emphasize masculinity and tends to emphasize this view of mythical view, almost of the man who doesn't really react in any external way to things and just takes it, and then is stronger because of that . Y eah . O ne of the arguments that these people make , for instance, , is that stoicism is a type of virtual ethics, and that the word virtue comes from the Latin there , V IR , which, in fact, means men ,. So there you go right , even the etymology tells you that it's about being a manly man and that sort of stuff . B ut that argument misses an important crucial point , which is . T. He word ver itself. Virtual in Latin is actually a translation of the original ,. The original was Greek because soicism ultimately is a Greek philosophy , not a Roman one ,. And the original word in Greek is Arte AR ETE , which just means excellence ,. It doesn't mean mainly anything ,. It just means do the best that you can , and it's gender neutral . Y eah . It ' s not a masculine, you know, word at all . So. Even at that level , we see sort of a superficial understanding , even at an etymological level ,. And certainly, at a historical level , we see a superficial misunderstanding , which turns into what I think is a counterproductive and potentially even dangerous kind of attitude . O kay . S toi cis m certainly does not condone a menly man approach to things. The ancient stocks themselves actually were unusual among Gregreor, Roman philosophers, because they explicitly said in writing , that women are rational human beings, just like men, and they're just as capable of understanding and practicing philosophy. ,. It's right there, black and white ,. It's in the writings ,. It doesn't need any interpretation. , both epicpictetus and Seneca explicitly say that in multiple points . So to pretend that somehow, this is a man thing, and that women need to be treated differently is just not stoicism , demonstrably not the case. ,. Also, if we're talking about virtue . W hile thetoics try to practice multiple virtues ,. One of these is justice . A nd justiceice is interpreted by the stoics as treating other people , any other people , regardless of gender, , race, , nationality, , ethnicity, , religion, or anything else , any other people with dignity , with respect in the way in which you yourself will want to be treated ,. So it's clearly nothing to do with a man approach to things , whatever that means .

### 警惕过度简化：引语与生活技巧的局限

许多人以过度简化的方式接触斯多葛主义，他们渴望立竿见影的效果，却不关心其历史背景、复杂性和细微之处。这种需求可以理解，但过度简化却有其危险，可能导致对哲学的误解，甚至采取与哲学本身背道而驰的行为。

斯多葛主义常见的两种过度简化方式是：
1.  **引语式斯多葛主义**（Stoicism by Quotations: 仅通过零散的格言来理解和实践斯多葛哲学）。互联网上充斥着斯多葛名言片段，有些甚至被错误归因。这些引语本身可能富有哲理，但一旦脱离其背景，不仅会失去部分意义，甚至可能引导人们产生与斯多葛哲学相悖的观念。事实上，早在两千年前，**塞涅卡**就曾警告朋友卢西利乌斯，不要仅仅引用作者的只言片语，因为这会导致对哲学的误解，必须通读全文才能真正理解。
2.  **生活技巧式斯多葛主义**（Stoicism as Life Hacks: 将斯多葛哲学视为一系列解决日常问题的实用技巧，而非连贯的人生哲学）。我们可以将斯多葛主义与佛教进行类比：多数人将佛教与冥想联系起来，但冥想只是辅助。真正的佛教在于接受**四圣谛**（Four Noble Truths: 佛教基本教义，解释苦的本质、来源、止息及解脱之道）或遵循**八正道**（Eightfold Path: 佛教修行方法，通往涅槃的八条正确道路）。冥想本身有益，但它并非佛教的终极目标，佛教的哲学关乎如何生活。

同样，斯多葛技巧即使脱离斯多葛哲学也很有用。例如，21世纪最流行的循证心理疗法**认知行为疗法**（Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT: 一种基于证据的心理疗法，受斯多葛哲学启发，但并非完整的人生哲学）就源于斯多葛主义的启发，并沿用其许多技术。然而，CBT并非一种人生哲学。一个高效的CBT实践者可以解决日常问题，但如果其品格恶劣，仍不能被称为斯多葛主义者。成为斯多葛主义者的核心在于以理性、亲社会的方式生活，并认识到地球上的每个人都是你的兄弟姐妹。这才是斯多葛主义的精髓，而非仅仅是遵循某种冥想方式。

P erh aps, not surprisingly , many people approach stoicism . In a way that oversimplifies the philosophy they want immediate results ,. They don't care about the historical background ,. They don't care as much about the complexities and the nuance of the philosophy. They just want something to work and I understand that sort of . N eed . At the same time , however, , there is a danger in oversimpling things ,. You may misconstrue things and you might act in a way that it's actually not at all in line with the philosophy itself . There are , for instance, , two ways to common ways to misconstrue sici sm . O ne is to do stoicism by quotations ,. So you find all over the internet, , snippets of stoic quotes , sometimes they're misattributed ,. They're actually not from a stoic , but let's say, from an E urea. N. Y eah . O ne of the most amusing mistakes that you find on the internet , for instance, , is that often, people quote the stoic epic pictet us , but they accompanied the quote with a picture of Epicurus, who was most definitely not a stoic, and epicpictetus would have been seriously disturbed by being mistaken for E pic ica us. B ut this issue of quoting things is problematic because . T. He se quotation marks , the sics are eminently. Quotable . That is ,. That is true . There is a lot of memorable phrases , sentences that you find in the stoic text . But. When you abstract them completely from the background , they not only begin to make less sense . they actually might . L et lead people to think in a way that it's contrary to stoic philosophy. ,. In fact, , apparently this was happening already 2000 years ago because the Stoic Seneca, who lived in the first century , W ar ns, one of his friends , L uci lus ,. And he says, . D on ' t fall into the temptation of just quoting bits and pieces of our authors , because that will lead you to misunderstanding the philosophy . You have to read the whole thing . You have to read what Zeeno was writing, or what Christryipus was writing , not just the bits and pieces , because otherwise, , you're not gonna understand what's going on. And. You are therefore going to act in a way that it's not in alignment with the philosophy . The other way to oversimplifytoicism is to approach it as a series of life hacks as opposed to a coherent philosophy of life . A nd, perhaps one way to understand what I'm getting at here is to make an analogy with another very famous and useful philosophy of life , which is B ud dhi sm , most people associate Buddhism with meditation . A nd. In fact, , Buddhism does come with a series of meditation ,. There are different kinds of meditations that you can do for different purposes within Buddhist philosophy. ,. However, , it turns out that empiricalbily speaking , a lot of Buddhist practitioners do not actually meditate . O kay . A nd? Just because you meditate, that doesn't make you Buddhist what makes your Buddhist is, for instance, , to accept the four noble truths or to try to follow the eightfold path to enlighten. That is the philosophy. That is what makes your Buddhist, whether you meditate or not. It's a different thing. Meditation is supposed to be an aid , a technical aid for doing the things that the philosophy says you should be doing, but people can achieve the same result without actually meditating. Now that said, meditation is, in fact, a standalone meditation is, in fact, useful mean, we have empirical evidence from modern medicine and modern psychology that meditation does certain things and allows you, for instance, , to deal better with chronic pain. It's certainly reduces your anxiety and things like that under certain conditions, but those are not the goals of B ud dhi sm , the philosophy, B ud dhi sm ,. The philosophy is not about anxiety or pain. It's about how to live your life. The same thing goes . F or stoicism , stoic techniques are, in fact, very useful, even when they are abstracted from stoic philosophy. , and proof of that is that cognitive behavioral therapy . T. He most popular evidence based type of psychotherapy that we use in the 21 st century did originate from an inspiration from stoicism, and it does use still today, a number of techniques that are found in storing texts , but Car behavioral therapy is not a philosophy of life . Y ou can be a very efficient . P raci tion er of cognitive behavioral therapy ,. You can solve your day to day problems and still be a psychopath or behave very badly or other people that would not make you a stoic. What makes you a stoic is if you try to behave to live your life in a reasonbased pro- oci al fashion. If you try to remind yourself that everybody on earth, every human being on earth, is your brother or sister, that is what makes you a stoic, whether you actually do your evening meditation in the way in which Marcus Aurelius did or not. That ' s , A practical aspect of it is a useful aspect of it ,. But that isn't what makes you bi .

### 斯多葛主义：超越享乐与依恋的智慧

一个常见的误解是，斯多葛主义与享乐是截然对立的。人们常将斯多葛主义与**伊壁鸠鲁主义**（Epicureanism: 一种享乐主义哲学，将快乐，特别是痛苦的减少，置于生活中心）对立起来，认为后者是古代哲学的“性、毒品和摇滚乐”。虽然伊壁鸠鲁主义确实是一种**享乐主义哲学**（Hedonistic Philosophy: 将快乐，尤其是痛苦的减少，置于生活中心的哲学），但斯多葛主义并非其对立面。斯多葛主义是一种**美德伦理**（Virtue Ethics: 以品格和美德为核心，旨在提升个人品质的哲学），其核心在于提升品格，成为一个更好的人。

**塞涅卡**本人曾说：“我并不愚蠢，我宁愿快乐也不愿痛苦，宁愿健康也不愿生病，如果可能，我甚至宁愿富有也不愿贫穷。只是这些并非我的优先事项。”这意味着斯多葛主义者并不排斥快乐、财富或健康，但它们并非人生价值的决定因素。财富、名誉乃至健康，在斯多葛学派看来，都是**优选无差别事物**（Preferred Indifferents: 斯多葛哲学中指本身无好坏之分，但因其通常有助于理性生活而值得追求的事物，如财富、健康、名誉）。它们本身对一个人的品格没有影响。例如，一个亿万富翁的成功并非因为他是斯多葛主义者，因为财富本身并不能使人成为一个更好的人。

另一个误解是，斯多葛主义提倡对事物和人保持超然的态度，类似于佛教。然而，斯多葛学派认为关心事物和人并无不妥，因为这是人类的本性。关键在于，这些外在事物不应定义你的品格。**爱比克泰德**曾用旅店的比喻来阐释这一点：人生就像住旅店，房间（朋友、亲人、物质财富）是你的，你可以享受，但不要过度依恋，因为你知道你只是过客，终将离开。离开时，应将一切保持原样甚至更好，因为其他人会继续使用。这并非意味着不享受生活中的美好，而是要认识到万物皆会流逝，要学会适时放手。

**爱比克泰德**还有一个关于“**冬日无花果**”（Figs in Winter: 爱比克泰德的比喻，指不合时宜的渴望。教导人们在合适的季节享受当下，珍惜拥有，并为失去做好准备）的著名比喻。当学生为朋友的离开而悲伤时，爱比克泰德指出，这就像在冬天渴望无花果。我们不仅要接受当下是冬天，没有无花果，更要学会珍惜在夏天享受无花果的时光。这个教训提醒我们，不要把人和事视为理所当然，而应在拥有时充分体验和珍惜，因为终有一天它们会离去。正如讲者本人在父亲去世后所领悟的，要活在当下，珍惜与亲友相处的时光，以免留下遗憾。

O ne common assumption is that stoicism is the antiticesis of pleasure ,. And in fact, often, if we're talking about Greor, Roman philosophies, , stoicism is opposed to epicureanism and epicurean ,. Most people think of epicureanism as sex, drugs and rock and roll of ancient philosophy, even though that description definitely would have been surprising to any ancient epicurean . O kay . It is true that Eureanism is a hedonistic philosophy. That is it's a philosophy that puts pleasure and it', specifically, in fact, reduction of pain at the center of their philosophizing at the center of their life ,. And it's true that stoism is not a hedonistic philosophy ,. It's a virtue ethics philosophy ,. It's based on character ,. The notion is to improve your character to become a better human being. However . T. He ancienttor Seneca himself says , " I'm not stupid , I prefer pleasure to pain . I prefer to be healthy to sick , I prefer even to be wealthy , to poor if possible. It's just that those are not my priorities. That is my life doesn't depend. The wordiness of my life does not depend on being rich. It does not depend on being healthy even, and it certainly doesn't depend on feeling pleasure. If I do have all of those things. Sure, I'll welcome them, but those are not crucial. The most important part of life for the Stoic is to be a decent human being , a human being that acts reasonably and pro socialcily. So for instance . Y eah . W hen I see articles that say, such and such billionaire got his success by being a stoic , I internally laugh or cringe depending on the situation because that's not what Su is about ,. It's not about becoming rich or famous . W ealth , reputation , even health are what the stoics call preferred indifferent . An indifferent isn't in a stoic parlance , something that you don't care about , as in the modern English word ,. It's something that literally does not make a difference. , does not make a difference to what to your character . To, who you are as a person . A gain the ss are very explicit about it. Epicpictus at some point tells some of his students. He says, here is a nonsor. And nonsor is something that doesn't follow in logic, right? Here's a nons qui or , I am rich , therefore, better I'm a richer than you are , therefore, I'm a better person than you are ,. He says that doesn't follow ,. What follows from the fact that you're richer than I am? Is that you have more money . Y eah , or well , that's the definition of being richer . It does not follow. You're a better person because being rich or being poor, doesn't make you a good person or a bad person ,. The two things are completely independent. You know the misconception about stoicism is that it's about cultivating an attitude of detachment from things and people . K ind of like B ud dhi sm. , often stoicism is presented as the Western alternative to B ud dhi sm ,. But there too , things are not quite that simple . F or the S toi Cs ,. There is nothing wrong with caring about things and caring about people. We're human beings , that's what we do. It's just that those things do not define who you are. W hich first a talk is the most important thing ,. In other words, , they don't actually define your character the way in which you behave . T, he interest like Cappiitus puts in very nicely in an analogy that uses with his students. , he says, you should try to go through life as if you were visiting an inn or a hotel while you are in the inn. , that's your room . Y eah . N obo dy is going to come in just all of a sudden versionrgin in. It's your room. The lamp on the table is your it is your lamp. That's your table ,. That's your bed and so on and so forth ,. So those things are in a sense yours, but you don't want to get attached to them, too attached to them, because you know that you are only passing through at some point, you will be checking out . Y eah . A nd moving on to something else. And when you do that , you want to leave all of those things , the table , the bed, , the lamp in as good, a shape as you found them , if not even better, because somebody else is going to use them. Next. The saying goes with things and people in life. It's not that they're not yours in that limited sense. , absolutely enjoy your friends, , your loved ones, enjoy the material possessions that you have. But the notion of , N ot developing too much of an attachment is in that particular sense, , treat everybody and everything as if you were passing through because you are passing through , absolutely take advantage of what's there . B ut then be ready to let go because at some point, you will have to let go . And. Your only two choices are you're going to let go. Graciously or ungraciously . Those are your only choices. Eventually things are going to go because you are going to go . One of my favorite metaphors by epicpicteus. That is related to this concept is the notion of figs in winter . Y eah . At some point ,. One of his students is complaining because a friend of that student is just left ,. We went overseas. And so he's not going to see him possibly for years , maybe ever ,. And he's very sad and all that . A nd Epius says , well , what you're doing now is pining for figs in winter ,. You want ,. In other words, , something that is not possible because it's not the right season. A nd, if you data says, not only you should accept that right now, it's winter and therefore, you're not going to have your fig. But . T. His should be a lesson to you to cultivate the notion that you should be enjoying the figs during the proper season during the summer ,. And that's a great lesson because very often, we don't pay attention ,. We take people and things for granted until they're gone . A nd then I mean, , this has happened to me as well. , you know, ,. One of the things that triggered my midlife crisis that eventually brought me, totoicism was the death of my father. A nd even though I knew that my father was suffering from cancer , he suffering , he had been suffering from multiple cancers over a period of years , and as a biologist , I understand what cancer is ,. So I had a knowledge of what was happening, and yet I still went on my life as if my father was going to be there forever . Y eah . A nd, then something happened , he died, and I was not there. , I was not present ,. So I regret that , but I learned that the lesson and said, I've lost other people since and I internalize the figs in winter lesson and I'm making I've been making and I'm still making a concerted effort with relatives and friends to actually be there and to savor that experience to savor those fruits of life. So to speak, because I know that the summer is going to go, eventually it' going to turn into winter. And that way I will be happy. I will not be complaining about opportunities missed because I will not have missed. Them.

### 斯多葛主义的积极行动与哲学适应性

另一个令人困惑的误解是，斯多葛主义会使人变得顺从，成为一种消极避世、不作为、孤立自我的哲学。这种观念可能源于对**坚忍**价值的片面理解。然而，这与斯多葛哲学的文本记载以及斯多葛派哲学家们在生活中所采取的实际行动是相悖的。**爱比克泰德**在《语录》中提供了多个斯多葛派“**仗义执言**”（spoke truth to power: 勇敢地向当权者说出真相，挑战不公）的例子。在罗马皇帝尼禄、维斯帕先和图密善统治时期，甚至存在一个被称为“**斯多葛反对派**”（Stoic Opposition: 罗马皇帝尼禄、维斯帕先和图密善统治时期，一群斯多葛派哲学家和元老因反对暴政而闻名）的群体。他们冒着生命危险反对暴政，因为**自由**和**独立**是真正的斯多葛价值观。

**塞涅卡**也多次提到**小加图**（Cato the Younger: 罗马政治家，朱利叶斯·凯撒的同代人，以其坚定的斯多葛原则和对暴政的抵抗而闻名），他曾多年在元老院中反对**朱利叶斯·凯撒**（Julius Caesar: 罗马共和国末期的军事统帅、政治家），因为他认为凯撒日益展现出暴君的倾向。当凯撒越过卢比孔河发动内战时，加图也拿起武器对抗。最终，凯撒获胜并试图活捉加图以展示其宽宏大量，但加图为了维护原则和尊严，选择了自杀。斯多葛学派对自杀问题非常严肃，认为这应是极端情况下的最后手段。加图的行动展现了极大的勇气和荣誉感，他为共和事业而战，最终为正义而死，而非退缩到被动状态。这应激励现代斯多葛主义者为个人和他人自由发声，捍卫自主权，并在看到这些价值受到威胁时，勇敢地承担起斯多葛实践者的责任，即使面临不愉快的后果。

斯多葛主义最吸引人的特点之一是其内在的**开放性**（Openness: 斯多葛哲学内置的特质，指愿意接受新思想并根据新发现调整其内部理论）。**塞涅卡**曾指出，前辈并非我们的主人，而是老师。他们发现了很多有用的东西，但并非全部。如果我们发现更好的方法，理性的选择就是相应地调整哲学。斯多葛主义已有两千多年的历史，始于公元前四世纪的雅典。这意味着，我们今天所学的许多科学和哲学知识，是古代斯多葛派所不知道的。因此，21世纪的斯多葛实践者不能简单地全盘接受古代斯多葛派的所有观点。

例如，古代斯多葛派的**天意**（Providence: 古代斯多葛派认为宇宙是一个有理性的活体，一切事件都是神/宇宙思想和行为的结果）概念，既有趣又优美，但讲者认为其存在深刻缺陷，需要被扬弃。古代斯多葛派是**泛神论者**（Pantheists: 相信神与宇宙合一，宇宙本身就是神），他们认为宇宙是一个有理性的活体，一切发生的事情都是神/宇宙思想和行为的结果。**爱比克泰德**曾说，睡觉前要亲吻妻儿，因为他们是凡人，明天可能就不在了，这样你就不会感到不安。他还用“脚踏泥泞”的比喻来解释，作为宇宙有机体的一部分，个人痛苦也是宇宙宏大计划的一部分，因此我们应该欣然接受甚至拥抱命运。

然而，作为一名现代生物学家和物理学爱好者，讲者无法相信宇宙是一个有生命的有机体。这并非简单的形而上学争论，而是具有实际影响。古代斯多葛派对**天意**的论证是基于**设计论证**（Argument from Design: 一种认为宇宙的复杂性和秩序性证明存在一位设计者的论证），即宇宙的复杂性如同精心设计的剑鞘与剑，暗示着一位设计者。在两千年前，这个论证很有说服力。但生活在21世纪的我们，必须面对18世纪哲学家**大卫·休谟**（David Hume: 18世纪苏格兰哲学家，批判了设计论证）对设计论证的哲学批判，以及一个世纪后**查尔斯·达尔文**（Charles Darwin: 19世纪英国生物学家，提出了自然选择进化论）提出的**自然选择进化论**（Evolution by Natural Selection: 达尔文提出的生物演化机制，解释了生物如何适应环境而无需设计者）。鉴于这些知识，我们必须像大多数生物学家一样，拒绝设计论证，进而拒绝斯多葛派的泛神论观点。

这意味着，我们必须修正对伦理和天意的理解。虽然接受现实仍然是斯多葛主义的一部分，但我们不必在情感上对亲人的逝去感到高兴或“不被打扰”。作为生物学家，讲者理解死亡是生命过程的自然组成部分，但在情感上，感到悲伤是正常的，也是可以接受的。这种哲学内部的适应性，使其能够根据科学和哲学的进步进行调整，这正是斯多葛主义与其他更僵化的哲学或宗教体系不同之处，也是其持续保持活力和吸引力的原因。

O ne baffling misconception for me about stoicism is that it turns people into doormats . it's a it's a quietest philosophy. It's about. N ot reacting ,. It's about not doing things , just trying to retreat into yourself and sort of isolate yourself from the rest of the world . I am not sure exactly where that particular misconception comes from , if not , again, , as a byproduct of the notion that stoicism values endurance . B ut. It's clearly contradicted by both the letter of the philosophy by what you read from thetoics themselves. And more importantly, perhaps, by the actions that we know those philosophers actually took in their life in the discourses. Epicttus gives us several examples of S stoics, who , as we were put today spoke truth to power ,. In fact, there was a whole group of stoic philosophers and Roman senators during the reigns of the emperors, Nero Vepaian and D oit ian , who were known as the stoic composition ,. These were people who were actually going to object to the dictates of Nero doitian and Vepaian because they saw them as tyrants . A nd liberty , freedom , independence , those are actual stoic values . An atoic could not abide by a tyrant ,. So these people risked their lives ,. In fact, some of them lost their lives as a result of a direct opposition to tyranny . T. Here are other examples as well. , Seneca talks a lot about a guy named Cato the Y oun gg er , who was a contemporary of Juli C aes ar . C ato opposed Caesar on the floor of the S ena te ,. They were both senators at one point in their political career . A nd Cato saw seeesar as increasingly developing sort of tyrannical aspects to his way of doing things. And so he opposed him on the Senate floor for many years. ,. Then at some point, famously , Judith Caesar picked up arms and moved to war against the Roman R epub lic ,. He crossed the Ruicon River famously saying, , you the Dais cast in our words , I am now cognizant of the fact that this is irreversible. Action. W ell , what did Cato do? ? It ' soka y ,. The time of debate is over. , I need to pick up arms as well. And so he organized an army, and he led an army against Juli C aes ar ,. So both Ju Caesar and Ca, the Youngger pick up arms ,. There is a civil war . It ' s a horrible thing, and there's nothing civil about it. , lots of people die on both sides. , eventually Ju prevails , you. He was an excellent general, and he defeats the Republican army . So now Caesar is after C ato ,. He wants to capture Cato alive because he wants to use him as a political . P ea ce ,. He wants to essentially show his magnanimity by saying, , here is my enemy . He actually picked up arms against me , but I'm. Okay. With that . I'm going to forgive him . But Cato was a man of principle, and he was not about to let . C aes ar take advantage of the situation that way. So Cato decides that the only way to avoid that is to . T ake his own life to commit suicide . The stoics have a whole literature about suicide . They take the issue very , very seriously . They say that it's it ought to be the last resort only under extreme circumstances . But Cato finds himself . In the last resort under extreme circumstances. , so he very calmly prepares himself. , he sends away his friends and his loved ones . P picks up a book , we know actually which book he read ,. He read one of Plato's dialogues about the nature of the soul . He has his dagger nearby ,. He picks up the dagger, and he stabs himself as the Roman did in his stomach ,. However, , he had been injured in battle, and so his hand, particularly in his hand, and his hand was not strong enough , so he falls down . Y eah . makes noise, therefore, , and so everybody rushes in from the other room, and a doctor sees what's happening ,. He realizes that no vital organ is being punctured, even though there is a mess around the blood all over. So the doctor tries to stitch the wound to put back things and then try to save Cato's life . K to ,. In the meantime comes back he had lost consciousness ,. He sees what the doctor is trying to do . P ushe s. The doctor away , reaches with his hand inside his own guts, , tears them away and throws them on the floor , thus dying . It takes a lot of courage and determination to do that sort of thing . I mean , I think that even the first part taking your dagger in your hand and stbbing yourself , that takes courage and determination , But going as far in the second bit, as Cato did means that this was a man who had a high sense of honor , a high sense of his own virtue and a high sense of what . Y eah . T. He meaning of his existence , Caesar realized what had happened, and he was really upset about it. He admitted that Cato had bated him at this. And in fact, Cato became a hero of the Republican cause for many ,. Many years afterwards. So here we have an example of atoic who actually was fighting and eventually died as a result of ,. Y eah . U nde rst anding, what the right thing to do was and wanted to do the right thing. , not endorsing injustice , not retreating into a passive, you know, inactive situation ,. So that should be inspiration to modern strikes, not necessarily in the sense that we're going to have to pick up weapons, hopefully against anybody , but certainly, it is about speaking out. Certainly, it is about. Y eah . D efendi ng one's own liberty and other people's liberty ,. It 's about personal autonomy and the autonomy of other people. And whenever you see as a stoic as a stoic practitioner , you see those things threatened ,. You really ought to speak out ,. It 's your duty as a stoic practitioner to do so and then face the consequences , which may not be pleasant , of course . Y eah . O ne of the features of stoicism that I find most attractive is that built into the system ,. There is an openness to new ideas and to adjust the philosophy internally so that it adapts to whatever it is that we may discover moving forward ,. In fact, , one of the ancient stoics S ene. Ca . W ites at one point that look ,. The people that came before us are not our masters ,. They're just our teachers ,. They knew a lot of things. And some of those things were very useful, and that's why we adopt them. B ut. That doesn't mean that they discovered everything ,. That doesn't mean that there are no new things to be discovered ,. And if we do find new ways and better ways of doing things, , Seneca says, ,. The only rational thing to do is to adjust our philosophy accordingly and move in a different direction. Stoicism, of course, is a philosophy that is over 2000 years old . It started out in the fourth century BC in A thens ,. You might expect . T hat, some things that we've learned in the meantime might be problematic in that respect ,. That is the Stoics didn't know everything that science and even philosophy have achieved over the intervening almost two and a half millennia ,. That means that if you're a practitioner of Stoicism today in the 21 st century , you cannot simply take everything that the ancient Stoics said. And go with it , pretty much in the same way in which nobody today is a practitioner of, say, Buddhism or Christianity, in exactly the same way in which people were practicing Buddhism or Christianity to millennia or two. And a half millennia ago . F orin stance , the stoic concept of Pronce is both . I nt eres ting and beautiful on the one hand, and yet I think deeply flawed and needs to be rejected on the other. And this is going to have practical consequences Let me back up for a second and explain what this is about the ancient Stoics were panists. That is, they believed that God is the same thing as the universe . It 's coincident with the universe . A nd. Therefore, they thought of the universe itself as a living organism endowed with reason ,. The universe is G od , nature is G od , God is thinking ,. And therefore, everything that happens in the universe is the result of the thinking and doing of G od . T. He cosmos or G od , the universe Now I find this a very beautiful idea. If only I could believe it. As a modern biologist. And as somebody who does a little bit knows a little bit about physics , I don't think of the cosmos as a living organism , I cannot imagine that sort of connection. Now you might say, , oh ,. So what this is just a metaphysical dispute, right? The the ancient stoic thought about God in the universe that way ,. You don't think of it that way ,. What difference does that make in practice? ? T urns out, it does make a big practical difference. ,. There are a few passages in the discourses of Epicteus as well as in his manual . W. Here, he says, something really surprising , really interesting. And at the same time, disturbing , he says, , remember when you go to sleep . K iss. Good night to your wife and your child because they're mortal, and they might not be alive tomorrow morning. That way you will not be disturbed . N ow when the first time I read that passage , I thought, what kind of a psycho about this ,? This guy , he's telling me that I should realize that my loved ones are mortal , I'm. Okay. With that ,. Yes , we are ,. We're all mortal . A nd therefore, , that means that at some day. I or them will die ,. But to say that I should remind myself of this so that I'm not going to be disturbed. , are you kidding me? , of course, I'm going to be disturbed if my daughter or my wife were to die. ? B ut then I understood where he was coming from ,. In fact, , Epiteus himself clearly makes an analogy , an interesting analogy that shows where he's coming from ,. He says . L ook , you are like a foot that is part of an organism ,. Let's say that the organism that the body has to get home and in order to get home , it has to cross a muddy path ,. It is up to you as the foot to step into the mud . N ow , if you think of that, only from the point of view of a foot . W ithout remembering that you're connected to a body, that's disgusting. Why would I want to step into the mud? This is not a not a pleasant thing ,. But if you remember that you are connected to a body, and then in fact, your entire purpose in life is to bring that body wherever it needs to go. Including ,. S tt ain g into the mud ,. Then not only you're going to do it , but you're going to do it gladly . Y ou ' re going to embrace not just accept your fate , so to speak , but embrace your fate . So. What Eteus is saying there is not as being psychopathic as far as we can tell. It's just being realistic in the way he understood the world, He said ,. Look . We ' re all literally bits and pieces of the God universe, and whatever happens to us , including the unpleasant bits , is actually for the good of the God universe ,. So if you understand things that way , not only you're going to accept what happens. So you're actually going to embrace it. N ow, it makes sense when he says, , you know, , if your loved ones die , you should not be upset , you should not be disturbed because you realize that whatever is happening , even though you may only get a small ,. P orti on of that picture , but whatever is happening is part of this universal cosmic plan, and you should feel good about it. , not this drop . It 's a beautiful way of looking at life . Un. Fortunately, , I don't think it's the right way to look at life . I wish I could bring myself to being a panteist in the way in which the engine stocks were . T hat would definitely provide me with a lot of comfort whenever something bad happens to me or to my loved ones. , but I don't believe in the cosmic G od ,. And therefore, I think that whatever happens to us is the result of neutral forces ,. The universe doesn't care one way or the other . T hat means that I cannot avail myself of the story concept of P rov iden ce ,. So what do I replace it with ?? W ell acceptance is still part of it. , right? I have to accept the reality of things . I am a biologist . I understand that people die. In fact, I understand that death is a natural part of the process of being alive, or the process of life on earth , If. Other people had not died , I would not be here because I would not have been born And. So my death , the death of other people ,. It 's natural. And as such . Y eah . It 's reasonable to accept it as much as one can at a rational level , but at an emotional level, , I am still not going to be happy about it. and I think that's okay. Not to be happy about it. So. That's one example of something that the ancient stoics thought at a metaphysical level and had consequences in terms of their day to day life , their ethics . A nd modern stoics have to modify , I think ,. Because in the meantime, , both philosophy and science have progressed to a point that makes the original idea untenable. In fact . If you're still not convinced ,. Let me give you one bit , one more bit of evidence that that things work pretty much in the way I just described it. If one asks well , what was . E pict eus is argument for thinking that the universe is a living G od . He does actually provide us with an argument. In fact, several the Stoics drew , Seneca does as well , and some of the other earlier S toi Cs , people like Z een o , who was the founder of the Stoic approach in the first place. , does the same thing ,. They all use an argument from design . T. Hey, say, just like the sword, perfectly fits the scabbard. And that tells you that somebody designed both of those objects to actually fit together in a functional way in a way that works . If you look around, you'll see that the universe is built in the same way. And frankly, , if I had lived 2000 years ago, I would probably buy into that argument ,. It 's a really cogent argument ,. You look around the complexity of the world, and you say, yeah, , that makes sense . Y eah . B ut I don't live 2000 years ago, , I live in the 21 st century , which means that I live after two major objections were raised to that way of looking at things to the design argument, specifically , the philosopher David Hume in the 1 8t h century, criticized the design argument on philosophical logical basis and showed that it's not really coherent . A nd then about a century later, , Charles D ar win , a biologist , actually proposed an alternative mechanism. We called it evolution by natural selection for why things seem to be designed in a certain way . G iven that knowledge , I have to reject the argument from design as pretty much every biologist does . And. If I reject that , then I also reject the stoic view of P anis m. And. If I reject that I have to revise my notions of ethics and providence . So. This is a good example , I. Think of how all of these things work together. scientific advancements will question our philosophical views. And . It 's a good thing if the philosophical views are able to adapt to what comes out of the new science , of course, , science in another century or five centuries or 10 centuries may tell us something different. And if they're stoics . Y eah . 10 centuries down the road , they will themselves face the same problem and have to adapt somehow . I find that very refreshing, because unlike other philosophical or religious systems, , tend, which tend to be much more rigid , resistant to change. This notion that change is inherent in the way in which we do stoic. Philosophy is very useful , very reasonable and very refreshing .
