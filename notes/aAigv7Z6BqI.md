title: 亚当·波森：通胀将回升至4%，美联储信誉受损
summary: 经济学家**亚当·波森**预测，到今年年底，通胀率将回升至4%。他认为，劳动力市场并非疲软，关税和反移民政策的滞后效应将显现，财政政策趋于扩张，而美联储的货币政策传导机制和信誉正在减弱。此外，地缘政治变化，特别是美国作为“保险提供者”角色的转变，正促使欧洲增加国防开支，这也将带来额外的通胀压力。波森强调，这些因素共同预示着通胀将更具持久性。

### 通胀走向：加速还是放缓？

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期 OddLots 播客。我是 **Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是 **Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，你知道，未来的经济总是充满不确定性。通胀的路径、就业的路径，总是有很大的争议。我认为现在与几年前相比，真正有趣的是，在不同时期，人们会说通胀会下降，但争论的是下降的速度。而现在的情况是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy, you know, future economy is always uncertain. Path of the path of inflation, path of employment, always big debates. I think what's really interesting right now compared to a few years ago maybe is you know at various times it's like inflation is going to come down but there's a fight over how fast right and now you have a situation which

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 有人持两种观点。一些人说：“哦，不，我们正在走向某种收益率数据阵营等等。”而另一些人则说：“看，我们正在重新加速，它会再次升温。”我们录制这期节目是在2月11日，我们刚刚看到了一份相当强劲的就业报告。所以一些人正在提出重新加速的论点。我们又回来了，又回来了。这份就业报告，我的意思是，它是一个惊人的数字。1月份新增了13万个就业岗位，而预期是6.5万个。即使你深入研究，它看起来也相当不错，对吧？但你说的完全正确。所以，我们过去常常争论我们会朝着一个方向走多远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: there are people who argue both sides some people's like oh no we're on a you know we're heading down the sort of yield data camp etc and others are like look we're reacelerating it's going to get hot again and we're recording this February 11th we just hit a fairly strong jobs print etc and so some people are making the reaceleration argument We are so back so back. Well, that jobs report, I mean, it was a blowout number. So, 130,000 jobs added in January versus expectations for 65,000. And even if you drill down into it, like it looks pretty good, right? But you're absolutely right. So, we used to argue about how far we would travel in one direction.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 会是4%吗？会是5%吗？随便。而现在我们正在争论我们到底会走向哪个方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: is it going to be 4%, is it going to be 5%, whatever. And now we're sort of arguing about which direction we're actually gonna go.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Totally.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我认为，如果你只是看一份就业报告，那当然要持保留态度。有很多证据表明劳动力市场在许多不同方面有所软化。房地产市场也持续疲软。另一方面，看看各种大宗商品，看看铜，看看其他许多东西。看看卡车运输价格，运费又开始回升了。我在 Odd Thoughts 时事通讯中写过这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I think like if you just look like okay one jobs report can't you know take it with a grain of salt there is there does seem to be a lot of evidence of some softening in the labor market by a lot of different measures etc. Housing market continues to be fairly soft. On the other hand look at various commodities you know look at copper look at a bunch of other stuff. Look at trucking prices freight picking back up etc. I wrote about this in the Odd Thoughts newsletter.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。有很多事情正朝着另一个方向发展，你会说：“看，这看起来像是再通胀。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. There's uh lots of things that are going in the other direction and you would say, "Look, this looks like reflation."

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。所以，我们今天要采访一位在一个月前提出了非共识观点的人，但我想，随着我们收到这类报告，这个观点可能正日益成为共识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yep. So, we are going to be speaking with someone who had a non-consensus call about a month ago, but again, I think it's becoming maybe more consensus by the day, by the hour as we get these types of reports.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 完全正确。我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾，他将给我们一个不同的视角，一个，我想说，仍然有点非共识的观点，但这绝对不是很多人希望看到的走向。如果你认为**美联储**今年应该迅速降息，那肯定不是这个方向。也许我们会谈谈美联储的事情。我们当然要采访**亚当·波森**。他是**彼得森国际经济研究所**的所长，最近与**彼得·奥萨格**合著了一篇文章，题为“4%的通胀。什么？”**亚当**，谢谢你回到演播室加入我们。4%的通胀。真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Totally. Well, we really do have the perfect guest to sort of give us a different take, a sort of I would say it's still a little bit out of consensus call, but um definitely um not the direction that a lot of people want to see. Definitely not the direction if you think that the Fed should cut rapidly this year. Maybe we'll talk some Fed stuff. We're going to be speaking, of course, to Adam Posen. He is the president of the Peterson Institute and recently co-authored a piece with uh Peter Orsag. Uh 4% inflation. What? Uh yeah, Adam, thanks for uh coming back and joining us here in studio. 4% inflation. Really?

</details>

### 波森的通胀预测：劳动力市场、关税与移民政策

**Adam Posen**: 谢谢 **Tracy**，谢谢 **Joe** 再次邀请我。是的，我的朋友们说我应该只说3.5%，那已经足够出格了。但我觉得到今年年底，核心**CPI**达到4%是现实的。正如你们两位所说，我认为通胀的走向是上升，而不是下降，而且趋势相当明显。当然，就像你刚才说的，有今天的就业报告，但我认为这是一个更广泛的模式。问题不在于，如你所说，某一个月的数据。更重要的是就业报告为何呈现出这样的结果。如果你看黄金年龄段的劳动力参与率，**Tracy** 刚才也提到了深入分析数据，在我看来，这是你能看到的最重要的统计数据之一，它仍然相当高。而且，如果他们不恢复一些**奥巴马医改**保险补贴，女性就有可能退出劳动力市场，照顾孩子、老人和病人。还有一个难题是，要么他们还没有驱逐或成功驱逐他们认为的那么多移民，要么你也在那里失去劳动力。所以，我很难将这视为一个非常疲软的就业市场。人们指出的那些现象，比如工资增长放缓，或者职位空缺与失业率相比，我认为并不代表需求侧放缓。它们代表的是经济学家所说的“不匹配”，意味着劳动力市场的功能不那么好。所以，举两个简单的例子，非裔美国人的失业率相对于平均失业率有所上升。从历史上看，无论是出于糟糕的原因还是好的原因，情况都是如此。但它曾大幅下降。所以问题是，它上升是因为他们是煤矿里的金丝雀，还是因为有什么特定因素影响了非裔美国人？不幸的是，我认为是特定因素导致了非裔美国人的失业率上升，那就是政府可能没有削减总体开支，但它大规模地重新分配了政府的开支方向。所以，教育部没了，很多环保部门没了，很多卫生和公共服务部门也没了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Thanks, Tracy. Thanks, Joe, for having me back. Yeah, I I mean, I've got friends who say I should have just said 3.5 and that would have been enough out of Exactly. But I think it's realistic to think about 4% by the end of the year on headline CPI. And just going to the spirit of what both of you were saying, I I think the direction of travel is up, not down and pretty clearly that way, there's obviously, like you just said, today's job report, but I think there's a broader pattern. The the issue isn't, you know, like you say, one month. It's more about why the jobs report looks the way it does. And if you look at prime age, like you Tracy was saying about drilling down in the numbers, if you look at prime age labor force participation, which to me is one of the most important statistics you can look at, it's still pretty high. And there's this risk of women dropping out of the labor force to look after kids and elderly and sick people if they don't restore some of the Obamacare insurance subsidies. And there is a conundrum that if you're either they haven't deported yet or managed to drive out yet as many migrants as they think or you're losing labor there too. So it's hard for me to see this as a very weak job market. the the kinds of things people point to like the slowing of wage growth or the vacancies over as compared to unemployment I think are not indicative of a demand side slowdown. They're indicative of what economists call mismatch meaning less good functioning in the labor market. So, just to give you two quick examples, African-American unemployment is up relative to average unemployment. Historically, for both nasty and good reasons, that's been the case. But it had come way down. So, the question is, is it going up because they're the canary in the coal mine, or is it because something specific hit African-Ameans? And unfortunately, I think it's something specific contributed to African-American unemployment, which is Doge may not have cut overall government spending, but it massively reallocated where our government spent. So, Department of Education gone, a lot of environmental gone, a lot of health and human services gone.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这些领域有很多政府承包商，它们由非裔美国人拥有、经营或雇佣大量非裔美国人。所以我认为非裔美国人失业率上升的部分原因，这并不意味着情况很好，只是意味着它不是需求冲击、下降或市场疲软的迹象，而是因为这一特定劳动力群体受到了打击。同样，我知道你们也做过几期节目讨论这个问题，我们看到年轻人就业减少的现象，特别是受过大学教育的年轻人，他们没有得到那么多雇佣。我认为这里有两件事正在发生。首先，我的意思是，这又是真实存在的，就像非裔美国人失业率一样。我不是说它不真实。我只是说它没有告诉你需求状况。所以，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And these are things where you had a lot of government contractors that were African-Americanowned or run or heavily populated. And so I think part of the reason African-American unemployment is up and that doesn't mean it's okay. It just means it's not a sign of demand shock or decline or soft market is because of this hit to this specific part of the workforce. Similarly, and I know you have had episodes talking about this issue, we see the phenomenon of young people having less hiring, particularly college educated people, young people not getting hired as much. And I think there's two things going on there. One is I mean it's real again like with African-American unemployment. I'm not saying it's not real. I'm just saying it's not telling you about the demand situation. So

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 它是特殊性的，而不是周期性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: it's idiosyncratic rather than cyclical.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 对。说得好。非常技术性。所以，我认为部分原因是年轻人失业率，大学年龄段年轻人的失业率，几年来一直在稳步上升。实际上，它不是突然变软的。自大约2023年以来，它一直在缓慢上升。对我来说，这与**COVID**疫情后的招聘和重新匹配有关，人们大量流动，公司将很多人调到新岗位，并在某种程度上额外招聘了人。所以存在这种积压，这尤其影响了年轻人。**AI**也在其中。我只是，那不是问题。所以，我不是想挑选数据，我只是想说，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Right. Well said. Very tech speak. Um so you know I think part of it is that we've the the rise in you younger people unemployment college age younger people unemployment has been a very steady rise for a few years. It's actually a a very it's not like suddenly oh it got soft. It's been coming up slowly since roughly 2023. And to me that has to do with the hiring and rematching coming out of co that people moved a lot companies moved a lot of people into new jobs and and they hired extra people in some sense and so there's this overhang and that's particularly affecting young people. I mean AI is in there. I'm just that's not thing. So anyway, I'm not trying to cherrypick data, but I'm just trying to say that

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 如果你把它与更广为人知的数据匹配起来，裁员率相对较低，工资增长正在放缓，但并未归零，参与率很高，月度就业数据波动，但以我们都应该正确看待的新基线来看是稳固的，我并不认为这是一个疲软的劳动力市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: if you match that with the more well-known data, the layoffs are relatively low, the wage growth is slowing, but it's not going to zero, that participation rate is high, that the monthly job numbers are fluctuating, but on the new baseline that we all rightly should be looking at solid, I don't see it as a weakw week labor market.

</details>

### 通胀压力：关税、移民、财政与货币政策

**Tracy Alloway**: 刚才你谈到了劳动力方面，但你预测今年年底通胀率将达到4%，这包含了许多不同的因素。那么，请你详细解释一下，你究竟是基于什么来做出这个判断的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, you just talked about the labor side, but your forecast for 4% inflation by the end of this year is comprised of many different things. So, walk us through what exactly you're looking at to get that that call.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 谢谢 **Tracy** 给我这个机会，Odd Lots 总是能让我表达不止两点。但我想，如果我想从头开始说，那就是有很多点。如果你退一步看，对吧？你会说：“好吧，如果我要预测未来一两年的通胀，那就要看劳动力市场有多疲软或多紧张，经济运行有多热烈。”这两者显然是重叠的。还要看我们是否会遇到供应冲击，比如关税或反移民政策。还要看财政政策在做什么，然后是货币政策在做什么，以及非常重要的是，它的可信度如何？它是如何传导的？所以，你沿着这个清单看下去，对我来说，有太多通胀的故事了。所以，关税，反移民政策，曾经有一场争论，或者至少很多人断言：“哦，这真的不重要。看，通胀没有那么高。”我的观点，我在几周前的一篇**彭博商业周刊**文章中也提到了，那就是我们不应该期望这些政策的影响会如此之快。事实上，如果你回顾一下，并不是说我们完美地预测了它，但如果你回顾一下我的同事**麦金农**和**诺兰**以及**彼得森国际经济研究所**的其他人在一年半前发表的关于关税或移民政策可能产生的影响的文章，他们都考虑了政策生效后一年的滞后效应。所以，大约在下个季度，我们才应该真正开始看到政策的影响。我们从**美联储**的褐皮书、**亚马逊**首席执行官的声明以及我的合著者**彼得·奥萨格**（他经营着**拉扎德**，在商界有许多联系人）的口中，都看到了这方面的轶事证据。企业需要时间来决定他们要做什么。即使是大型公司，更不用说小型公司了，这都非常困难。比如，“我是否要寻找新的供应商？我是否要把生产从中国移出？我是否要把它移到墨西哥？我是否要把它移到美国？我能找到替代品吗？我现在就涨价吗？我等到竞争对手涨价吗？如果我去见**霍华德·卢特尼克**，我能获得关税豁免吗？”所有这些都需要时间来解决。对于移民家庭或移民工人，无证移民工人来说，情况也是如此，他们很难——撇开令人惊叹的可怕的人道主义方面不谈，只从经济角度看——他们必须下定决心。“**ICE**真的会来抓我吗？他们会来我的城镇吗？我的雇主会保护我吗？在我离开之前，我还有多长时间可以积累美元工资？我能躲起来继续工作吗？如果我走了，我是合法离开吗？我带我的孩子一起走吗？我不带我的孩子走吗？我尝试回来吗？”这些都是不可逆转的决定。这需要时间，你希望看到不确定性改变，或者至少在做出决定之前得到解决。所以对我来说，我认为反移民政策和关税带来的这些通胀压力已经存在，但它们将加速并变得更加明显。然后，更快地谈谈其他几点：财政政策。我认为国会的**共和党**多数派和总统会希望在中期选举前向人们发放大量现金。我认为他们会通过一些恢复**奥巴马医改**保险对中低收入阶层的补贴的法案，因为它确实在伤害人们，也确实让人们感到愤怒。把这两者加在一起，那将是**GDP**额外赤字的2%以上。所以，假设你对其进行风险加权，假设你给发放支票50%的可能性，给奥巴马医改补贴恢复一定金额80%到90%的可能性。你把这个加权平均值算进去，仍然会使赤字增加**GDP**的1%以上，这是人们没有预料到的。然后你还会看到美元走弱。然后就是**美联储**。这我们已经谈过几次了，你也很慷慨地邀请我来。尽管**特朗普**不断谈论并向美联储施压，但利率并不能充分概括经济中货币状况的状态。所以，你有所有这些私人信贷，你有所有**AI**投资，这些投资要么来自留存收益，要么来自发行债券，而不是基于信贷，也不是基于正常的银行借贷或大额贷款。正如 **Joe** 所说，你有一个疲软的房地产市场，但实际抵押贷款利率一直在下降，而且抵押贷款资金并非不可获得。所以，这不是一个信贷紧缩的环境。最后，令人遗憾的是，我们必须考虑到对美联储的所有攻击以及美联储的变化。我不太关注个人。我认为哪个个人并不那么重要，而是美联储面临的结构性变革力量。你必须相信，这会降低美联储的信誉，降低他们足够快地对这种通胀做出正确反应的可能性。所以，一连串的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Thanks, Tracy. Thanks, Joe, for having me back. Yeah, I I mean, I've got friends who say I should have just said 3.5 and that would have been enough out of Exactly. But I think it's realistic to think about 4% by the end of the year on headline CPI. And just going to the spirit of what both of you were saying, I I think the direction of travel is up, not down and pretty clearly that way, there's obviously, like you just said, today's job report, but I think there's a broader pattern.

They're indicative of what economists call mismatch meaning less good functioning in the labor market.

And unfortunately, I think it's something specific contributed to African-American unemployment, which is Doge may not have cut overall government spending, but it massively reallocated where our government spent. So, Department of Education gone, a lot of environmental gone, a lot of health and human services gone. You put those two together, that's well towards 2% of GDP in additional deficit. So say you risk weight it, say you put a 50% chance on the the checks being handed out and you put, I'd say, an 80 to 90% chance on some amount of Obamacare subsidies coming back. You put in that weighted average, that still gets you an additional percent plus of GDP on the deficit that people weren't figuring. Then you got a weaker dollar. Then you've got the Fed. And this is something we've talked about a few times when you've been kind enough to have me on. The interest rate for all Trump talking constantly about it and pressuring the Fed doesn't summarize sufficiently the state of monetary conditions in the economy. So you've got all this private credit, you've got all the AI investment being funded either out of retained earnings or out of issued bonds, not based on credit, um not based on normal bank borrowing or or big stuff. And as Joe says, you have a soft housing market, but mortgage rates in real terms have been coming down and it's not like mortgage money is unavailable. So it's not a tight credit environment. And so then finally, regrettably, we have to take into account all the attacks on the Fed and the changes at the Fed. And I'm not too into personalities. I don't think it matters that much which individual, but the structural forces on the Fed for change. And you have to believe that makes the credibility, the likelihood that they're going to react in the right direction to this inflation soon enough lower. So, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

### 关税：通胀还是去通胀？

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这是一个很好的总结或概述，有很多后续问题可以问，但我们先谈谈关税。我当然同意你的观点，任何公司都需要一段时间才能决定其定价策略。巧合的是，一些公司在关税生效近一年后，正朝着相反的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, that was a great summary or overview of your view and there's uh plenty of follow-ups to ask about that, but let's just talk about the tariff. So I certainly take your point that it would take any company a while before they decide their pricing strategy. Incidentally not you know some companies you know about almost a year after the tariffs are going in the other direction

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 例如**百事公司**，他们就降价了。所以现在很明显，一些公司决定降价。但就关税而言，即使从理论上讲，我能理解这是涨价的好理由。另一方面，关税是一种税收，通常我们认为税收是反通胀的。它们从经济中抽取资金。我想问的问题是，每家公司都希望能够转嫁更高的成本。他们是否需要需求方面的支持才能做到这一点？因为另一种可能性是，他们只能在利润中消化这些成本，因为消费者不愿意，或者，就像**百事公司**的消费者显然不愿意继续为最终商品支付高价一样。关税本身是通胀性的，还是只有在有需求提振的情况下，比如支票或**奥巴马医改**补贴回归等，它们才具有通胀性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Pepsi for example so they cut prices. So now clearly like some companies are decided they cut but just on tariffs you know even theoretically like yes I can understand the argument this is a good reason to raise prices. On the other hand, tariffs are a tax and generally we think of taxes as disinflationary. They take money out of the economy. Here's what I guess the question is every company would love to be able to pass on higher costs. Does there need to be something on the demand side for them to be able to because another possibility is they just have to eat it in margins because the consumer is not willing or you know as the Pepsi consumer evidently they're they don't want to continue to pay high prices for end goods like are tariffs per se inflationary or are they only inflationary if there's sort of a demand boost something for like the checks or the Obamacare subsidies coming back etc.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: **Joe**，你为这个问题增加了一个非常好的复杂层面。你说的完全正确。这因公司而异，因行业而异。决策过程的一部分是竞争格局是什么样的。我们确实看到，我很自豪地说，**百事公司**是**彼得森国际经济研究所**的众多企业支持者之一。我是它的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: That's a a really good added layer of sophistication to this, Joe. And you're absolutely right. It varies from company to company, from industry to industry. The decisions part of the decision-making process is what is the competitive landscape and we do see I'm proud to say PepsiCo is one of the many corporate supporters of the Peterson Institute. I'm a big fan and

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 很好的披露。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: good disclosure there.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 不，不，我必须诚实，我很自豪能诚实。我们所有的捐助者都列在我们的网站上。但无论如何，**百事公司**可以说正面临食品行业的许多根本性趋势，与**GLPs**（胰高血糖素样肽）有关，与健康观念等因素有关，这些因素当然会压倒一切。而且与其他一些公司相比，他们实际上并没有那么受关税影响，因为他们不进口糖，也不像汽车公司那样进口原材料。但无论如何，这只是说明了你的观点，即情况会因公司而异。我的论点只是，作为一般情况，对于任何一家公司来说，这都不是一个微不足道的决定。你不会轻易做出决定。但你进一步的观点，**Joe**，即它在某种程度上取决于需求，是完全正确的。所以这有两个方面。一个就是你刚才说的，如果结果是需求疲软，你可能不会看到价格上涨那么多，因为任何一家公司都必须额外决定，如果我涨价，我会损失多少市场份额。但此外，还有一个互动效应，这就是为什么我最初与 **Tracy** 讨论劳动力市场时强调那么多，这与其说是一个需求侧问题，不如说是一个投入侧问题，对吧？我们是在一个紧张的劳动力市场中吗？我们是在一个紧张的大宗商品供应市场中吗？这些事情重要吗？以及我们对经济中更广泛通胀的预期是否正朝着高位移动？所以，再次回到你的核心观点，你是对的，它是互动性的，这就是为什么当你谈论通胀时，你希望考虑所有这些组成部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: No, no, I have to be honest and I'm I'm proud to be honest. All our donors are listed on our website. But anyway, PepsiCo is arguably facing a lot of fundamental trends in the food industry and having to do with GLPs, having to do with health perceptions and things that of course are going to overwhelm for them and they actually are not that exposed to tariffs compared to some other companies cuz they're not importing sugar and they're not importing inputs the way say auto company is. But anyway, but just that that just illustrates your point that it is going to vary from company to company. And my argument was just that as a general thing for any given company, it's not a trivial decision. You don't just go. But your point, your further point, Joe, that it's sort of conditional on demand is absolutely right. So there's two aspects to that. One is just literally what you said that if it turns out there's slack demand, you may not see the rise in pricing as much because you just the company any given company additionally has to decide you know how much am I going to lose market share if I raise prices. But additionally there is an interactive effect that when you are when this is why I made so much about the labor market initially with tracing it's it's a question of not so much the demand side as your input side right are we in a tight labor market are we in a tight supplies market for commodities do these things matter and and our expectations about inflation in the economy more broadly moving towards the high side and and so again just to come back your bottom line point is right it's interactive and that's why when you talk about inflation you want to have all these components

**Adam Posen**: Just from a math perspective, what you often hear is that, well, you know, you might have a price impact from tariffs, but it doesn't matter that much because it's a one-off and then, you know, the next year the base effect kind of goes away.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但如果我们今年年底达到4%的通胀，这重要吗？或者你认为这将是价格持续上涨周期的开始吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But does it matter if we get 4% at the end of the year or would you expect this to be a sort of the start of a durable price increase cycle?

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 嗯，我认为是的，它是一个持久价格上涨周期的开始，正如你所说。这部分与总体经济状况有关，部分与关税和冲击的性质有关。所以我认为，在一个劳动力市场没有高失业率、没有大量闲置（无论别人怎么说）的世界里；在一个他们将财政燃料投入火中的世界里；在一个无论你如何看待从 **JPAL** 到被提名的**凯文·沃什**的过渡以及对**美联储**的攻击，你都无法相信美联储对低通胀的承诺的可信度像几年前那样强大的世界里。所有这些都表明，任何给定的冲击，任何给定的价格冲击，在我看来，都将转化为比几年前在不同环境下更高、更持久的通胀。第二点是，我忘了它现在叫什么了，但以前**哈佛商学院**有一个“百万价格项目”，一直在研究价格传导，还有其他人也在研究，**彼得森国际经济研究所**的人也在研究。第二件事是移民冲击，如果他们真的驱逐了一百万人口，一百万工人，那么它将比关税冲击产生更大的第一轮效应。我认为合理的估计是，在过去一年中，关税冲击已经产生了大约1.5年的**CPI**效应。我认为，如果他们真的在驱逐移民（我们可以讨论为什么我一直有条件地说，我不确定他们是否已经驱逐），但如果他们真的在驱逐，我们谈论的可能是四到六倍的规模。但最后我想要强调的是，**Tracy**，当你谈到通胀的持久性时，这是一个人们期望货币政策如何反应的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Well, I think yes, it it is a start of a durable, as you put it, price increase cycle. And again, it's partly to do with the general conditions, and it's partly to do with the nature of the tariffs and the shock. So I think in a world where the labor the labor market is not high unemployment, lots of slack, whatever anybody says. In a world where they are going to be putting fiscal fuel on the fire, in a world where whatever you think about the transition from JPAL to nominated Kevin Worsh and the attacks on the Fed, you cannot believe that the Fed's credibility of commitment to low inflation is as strong as it was a few years ago. All of those things suggest that any given shock, any given price shock will to me translate into higher and more persistent inflation than it would say a few years ago in a different circumstance. The second point is and and there's this I forget what it's now called but there used to be the million prices project at Harvard Business School that's been looking at the price pass through and there have been others looking at it and [clears throat] people at Peterson as well. The the second thing is the migration shock if it turns out they do drive out a million people million workers is going to have much bigger first round effects than the tariff shock. the tariff shock. I think reasonable estimates are they've already had 1 point years worth of CPI effects roughly over the past year. I think if if they really are pushing out the migrants and we can go to why I keep putting it conditionally and saying I'm not sure they have yet, but if they really are, we're talking about something potentially four to six times as large. But then the the final thing I want to emphasize Tracy is on the when you say about the durable size of inflation it is a question of what people expect the monetary policy response to be.

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。所以我们从80年代，也就是40年前，吸取了一个非常重要的教训。上次美国通胀高企时，即使在**保罗·沃尔克**的领导下，他们在1982年石油冲击后进行了反通胀，但他们并没有完全将其降下来，而是在通胀率达到4%左右时停止了。所以当1985年通胀再次卷土重来时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. And so we have a very important lesson from the 80s from 40 years ago last time we had high inflation in the US even under Paul Vulker they disinflated in 1982 after an oil shock but they didn't take it all the way down they stopped when it got to around 4%. And so then when the inflation came back in ' 85,

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 结果通胀变得更加持久和更高。**沃尔克**和**美联储**不得不采取更多措施来提高利率。大多数人会认为，我的意思是，他们确实提高了利率，但我们大多数人会认为，部分原因是这是第二轮通胀，他们第一次没有完全将其压制住。我认为你可以再次提出这个论点，这虽然是推测性的，但我认为这里有历史的相似之处。如果我们现在遇到这种通胀冲击，它是在上次通胀发生五年或四年（而不是三年）之后，通胀再次没有完全降到2%的目标，在这种情况下，我认为上行风险更高。所以

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: it turned out to be more persistent and higher [gasps] and Vulkar and the Fed had to do more to raise rates. Most people would argue, I mean, clearly they did raise rates more, but most of us would argue part of the reason for that was because it was the second round of inflation and they hadn't fully stomped it out the first time. And I think you can make the case again this is speculative but I I think there's a historical parallel here. If we get this kind of inflation shock now coming it's five years or four years instead of 3 years but four years after the last inflation having again the inflation not come all the way down to 2% target in this case I think the upside risk is higher. So

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这很有趣。你知道，上次我们在**杰克逊霍尔**见到你，或者说我们和**艾米·中村**做了一期节目，谈论中央银行信誉的价值，以及信誉储备是固定的，或者说信誉储备会随着时间流逝而耗尽，可能需要一段时间才能重新填满这个“水库”。所以你所说的与此不谋而合，那就是如果你不能在相当短的时间内将其压制回2%，那么下次出现冲击时，你可能需要付出这种持续性的代价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: this is interesting. You know when uh when we were at Jackson Hole the last time we saw you um or that we did an episode with Emmy Nakamura and talking about this idea of like the value of central bank credibility and there's like kind of a fixed stock of it or the stock of credibility can deplete over time and it might take a while to refill the reservoir so to speak. So what you're saying is sort of dovetales with that which is that if you don't sort of in fairly short order smash it back to 2%. that there is this sort of like persistent cost that you might pay the next time there's a shock

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 这就是我们通常在数据中看到的。**中村**教授对此可能有不同的看法，但根据我对研究的理解，包括我的**彼得森国际经济研究所**同事**约瑟夫·贡**在这些问题上的一些研究，如果你未能将其压制下去，那么通胀预期的“锚定”就会降低。很多人关注**密歇根大学通胀预期调查**或**纽约联储调查**。我们上周五在**彼得森国际经济研究所**请到了一位来自密歇根大学的女士（抱歉我记不住她的名字），她负责这项调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: for that's generally what we see in the data and professor Nakamore may have a different take on this but but what to my understanding of the research including by a colleague of mine at Peterson Joseph Gon on some of these issues is if you fail to stomp it down the anchoring as the phrase is of of inflation expectations is lower and so a lot of people focus on the U Michigan survey of inflation expectations or the New York Fed survey. Uh we had uh oh god I can't remember her name I apologize from Michigan who who runs that survey speak at the Peterson Institute last Friday.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 如果你想听，有视频。她可以指出长期通胀预期没有太大变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: There's a video if you want to hear and and she can point to the fact that the long-term inflation expectations haven't moved that much.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 我的观点是，这只能说明这么多，因为人们有理性的不注意。他们不会把一生都花在思考通胀上，除非他们不得不这样做。所以问题更多是，当通胀来临时，他们会如何反应？除了我的同事**约瑟夫·贡**的工作之外，**伯克利大学**的**尤里·戈罗德尼琴科**教授和他的合著者在去年夏天，我认为是在**杰克逊霍尔**会议之前，在另一个**美联储**会议上发表了一篇非常有趣的文章，表明通胀预期存在持续较高的上行风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: My view is that only tells you so much because it it's it's people have rational in attention. They don't spend their lives thinking about inflation unless they have to spend their lives thinking about inflation. And so the question is more when inflation comes how do they react? And so besides the work of my colleague Joseph Gon there's a professor at Berkeley Yuri Gorald Nikenko and his co-authors who did a really interesting paper last summer I think ahead of Jackson Hall at a different Fed conference showing that there was this persistently higher upside risk on inflation expectations.

### 货币政策传导机制与私人信贷

**Tracy Alloway**: 既然我们谈到货币政策，你之前提到了，但你论点中一个非常有趣的地方是，你认为传导机制不再像以前那样了，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Since we're on monetary policy, you touched on this earlier, but one of the very interesting things in your argument is, you know, you contend that the transmission mechanism isn't quite what it used to be,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 可能是因为私人债务的扩张。它与银行利率、银行贷款利率的关联性较小。请多谈谈这一点，因为如果我看到一个通胀环境，而你说通胀的持久性取决于中央银行的反应，即使他们提高利率，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: possibly because of the expansion of private debt. It's less linked to bank rates, bank lending rates. talk more about that because if I see an inflationary environment and you say the durability of that inflation depends on what the central bank does in response even if they raise rates

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这足以将其压制住吗？因为正如我们所见，我们已经向许多中央银行家提出了这个问题，但金融状况仍然非常非常

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: is that going to be enough to stamp it out because as we've seen and we've asked a number of central bankers this question at this point but financial conditions are still really really

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 完全正确。是的，我认为你完全正确。我知道你最近和前**美联储**副主席**理查德·克拉里达**做了一期节目。当他担任副主席时，他试图推广一个想法，我想我不知道他们是否真的这么称呼它，但本质上是一个货币状况指数。我认为它有14个组成部分，但基本上是试图从概念上达到你刚才所说的：在教科书中，中央银行有三个渠道来收紧政策。一是它直接影响银行存款和银行贷款的数量。二是它通过收益率曲线产生反响，如果你移动收益率曲线的短端，它会降低收益率曲线远端的期限。但沿曲线确实有一些反响。然后第三个是这个预期渠道。人们最终是否相信**美联储**会控制住局面？但与此同时，那是教科书。实际工作的中央银行家，这与撰写教科书的人有些重叠，尽管我不是其中之一，但实际工作的中央银行家，追溯到**保罗·沃尔克**时代，都非常关注货币传导的“管道”，这意味着金融系统的哪些部分受到利率变动、量化紧缩或监管规则的影响有多大。所以**沃尔克**著名地对货币市场共同基金的出现感到非常不满，因为他认为这些基金不会像**美联储**利率变动那样受到影响。我认为现在一个更严重的问题是私人信贷的存在，它不仅存在，而且正在增长，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: exactly no I think you're absolutely right and I know you recently did an episode with former Fed vice chair Rich Clara and when he was vice chair. He tried to promote this idea of I think I don't know if they actually called it this but essentially a monetary conditions index. I think it had 14 pieces to it but basically trying to get at what you just said conceptually that if you in the textbook the central bank has three channels through which it tightens policy. One is it directly affects the amount of bank deposits and bank lending. The second is there are repercussions through the yield curve that if you move the short end of the yield curve, it decreases the further out the yield curve in duration you go. But there is some repercussions along the curve. And then the third is this expectations channel. Does do people believe ultimately that the Fed will get things under control? But at the same time, that's the textbook. The working central bankers and this overlaps somewhat with the people who wrote the textbooks although I'm not one of them but the working central bankers going back again Voke Paul Vulker are very concerned about monetary transmission in the plumbing meaning which parts of the financial system get affected how much by moves in interest rates or quantitative tightening or regulatory rules and so Vulkar famously was very upset when money market mutual funds came into play because the idea was those wouldn't be as affected by Fed interest rate moves. I think a much more serious issue right now is the existence of private credit where not only it exists but um and is growing

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 并且正在增长，但我们对其的监管或透明度非常低。所以中央银行或任何人都不知道到底有多少私人信贷，流向哪里，条件是什么，其中一些可能有多不稳定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and is growing but that we have very little supervisory or regulatory transparency into it. So the central bank or anybody doesn't really know how much is out there, where it's going, what terms, how how shaky some of it might be. [snorts]

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 但无论如何，重点是，再从房地产市场来看。几年前，**美联储**进行了非常强劲的紧缩。通常，直到几年前，你会看到的最早迹象之一是独栋住宅和普通住宅建设会出现裁员，因为这些往往是小型公司，它们非常依赖信贷，既依赖需求（它们的客户依赖抵押贷款），也依赖供应（它们需要信贷来开展业务）。通常，**美联储**紧缩对实体经济的最早影响之一就是该行业的收缩。我们没有看到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: But anyway, so the point is, think about it again with respect to the housing market. So we had a very strong Fed tightening a couple of years ago. And normally up until a couple of years ago, one of the first places you would see that would be that there would be layoffs in single family and general residential construction because these tend to be small firms that are very credit dependent, very both demand. Their their customers are dependent on mortgages and supply. They need credit to do what they do. And usually the first one of the very first effects on the real economy of a Fed tightening would be contraction in that sector. We didn't see it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们看到了**美联储**非常大幅度的紧缩，但住房领域的失业率基本没有上升，住房开工率也没有太大变化。这种情况在许多行业都得到了复制，这些行业过去被称为经济中的利率敏感型行业。所以如果你回到我开始的地方，你说有这些多重渠道，对吧？那么，可以说三个渠道中的两个比以前弱了。所以对银行系统的影响，在经济中信贷可获得性的影响方面，代表性更低。对预期的影响，由于我们刚才谈到的原因，可能不会那么迅速或强烈。再次强调，**美联储**可以恢复它。回到 **Joe** 总结**艾米**工作的方式。我的意思是，你可以恢复它，但你可能需要做些什么才能恢复它。所以，你只剩下中间这个渠道，也就是收益率曲线。即使在正常时期或不那么混乱的时期，曲线的短端和长端之间也从未有过同步。**达拉斯联储主席洛里·洛根**几周前就此方面的一些问题发表了演讲，她在这方面是专家。但底线是，你，我的意思是，再次从方向上看，如果**美联储**收紧政策，所有这三个渠道都会产生一些紧缩效应，但有充分理由认为，这些效应都不会像以前那样，对你的加息产生强大的“性价比”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We saw a very large Fed tightening and essentially no unemployment rise in in housing and not very much change in housing starts. And that's been replicated across a number of sectors, what used to be called interest rate sensitive sectors in the economy. And so if you go back to where I started and you say there are these multiple channels, right? So two of the three channels arguably are weaker than they used to be. So the impact on the banking system is less representative of the impact on credit availability in the economy. The impact on expectations for reasons we were just talking about may not be as rapid or strong. Again, the Fed can get it back. Going to how Joe summarized Emy's work. I [clears throat] mean, you can get it back, but you probably have to do something to get it back. So, you're left with this middle channel, which is the yield curve. And even in normal times or or less chaotic times, there never was a lock step between what happened at the short end of the curve and what happens at the long end of the curve. and Fed uh Dallas President Lori Logan gave a speech a few weeks ago I think on some of the aspects of this where she's an expert but the bottom line I keep using that phrase sorry but the bottom line is you I you again directionally if the Fed tightens all three of these channels will have some tightening effect but there's good reason to think that none of these effects will be as powerful bang for your rate hike as it used to

### AI支出与生产力增长

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们谈谈**AI**支出。2026年的数字已经令人瞠目结舌，现在它们将更加令人瞠目结舌。我们从**Alphabet**和**亚马逊**那里得到的数字远高于预期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's talk about AI spend. The numbers were already going to be eye watering for 2026 and now they're going to be more eyewatering than that. And we got numbers from Alphabet and Amazon that were just much higher than

**Tracy Alloway**: 对。我的意思是，我们谈论的是，这会影响**GDP**。这些是改变**GDP**的数字。请告诉我们，你如何看待这种支出带来的连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Right. I mean, we're talking like, you know, this moves GDP. This is a GDP altering numbers. Like, talk to us about how you see the ripple out effects from that spending.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 所以，这很吸引人，实际上我听你们的节目，听你们和那个领域的人交谈，获得了一些见解，因为我作为宏观经济学家，思考这个问题的角度不如他们。所以，第一点，再次从货币传导方面开始，是其中大部分是自筹资金或很容易获得融资的。所以，**谷歌**现在正在发行，我想是这种百年债券。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: So, it's fascinating and I actually listen to you all for some of your insights when you talk to people more in that space than I am as a macroeconomist thinking about it. So, the first point go starting again with the monetary transmission aspect is so much of this is self finance or easily financed. So, so Google's now issuing I guess this hundredyear bond. Yeah,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我希望如此，我的意思是，我希望每个人在100年后都还在，并且能得到偿还，那会很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I [snorts] hope so in the sense of I hope everybody's still around in a 100 years and gets paid back and that would be nice.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我肯定不会在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I won't be I'm pretty sure.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 是的。嗯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Yeah. Well,

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你知道，那是一份英国债券。那是一份以英镑计价的债券，因为那些 **LDI** 长期

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: you know, it's a it's a British bond. It's a sterling based bond because of those the LDI long

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 期间。是的。是的。他们被迫持有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: during Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're forced to hold.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 我的意思是，大部分都是现金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: My point is like most of it has been cash

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当然。是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: of course. Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 所以，我的观点是，即使那些不是现金融资的部分，也正在非常容易地获得融资。所以这是第一点。因此，经济的其他部分没有出现信贷挤出效应。他们这样做没有信贷限制。这有一个有趣的含义，我最近几个月在不同场合提到过，那就是，除了**AI**之外，我们从经济其他部分获得的投资如此之少，这更令人震惊。我的意思是，如果你想想**特朗普**政府官员可以列举的一系列理由，说明为什么除了**AI**之外应该出现投资繁荣，对吧？我们已经永久性地削减了有利于企业投资的税收。我们正在放松管制。我们正在采取措施使劳动力市场对雇主更友好。我们有更便宜的能源价格，直到**AI**推高其中一些。但总的来说，我们有更便宜的国内能源供应，而且我们有一个**美联储**，直到最近看起来还在降息。所以除了**AI**之外，本应该出现投资繁荣。我的观点是，**特朗普**政府制造的大量不确定性，包括通过关税和反移民政策，以及在其他领域，是为什么除了**AI**之外没有投资繁荣的原因。这不是因为信贷紧缩。而且人们应该更认真地对待这一点。再次强调，这并没有改变你刚才说的，**Joe**。**AI**所做的一切都令人瞠目结舌。这并不意味着总**GDP**必须收缩，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: So, my my point was even the parts that are not cash financed are being very easily financed. So that's the first point there. There is no credit crowding out in the rest of the economy because of this. There is no credit constraint on them doing this. That has an interesting implication which I've mentioned at various times in recent months that makes it all the more striking how little investment we're getting from the rest of the economy. I mean, so if you think about sort of the litany of reasons that a Trump administration official Xanti could give for why there should be investment boom beyond AI, right? We've made permanent the tax cuts that are favorable to corporate investment. We are deregulating. We are doing things to make the labor market more friendly to employers. We've got cheaper energy prices until AI pushes up some of that. But broadly speaking, we got cheaper domestic energy supply and we got a Fed that until recently looked like it was cutting rates. So beyond AI, there should have been an investment boom. And my view is that a lot of the Trump administration's creation of massive uncertainty, including through the tariffs and the anti-migration policy, but in other fields as well, is why you don't have an investment boom outside of AI. It's not because of tight credit. Um, and people should be taking that more seriously. Again, that doesn't change what you just said, Joe. It's eye watering what AI does. That doesn't mean the total GDP has to contract,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但我认为人们应该注意到我们没有出现投资繁荣这一事实。我的同事**彼得森国际经济研究所**的**卡伦·迪南**在去年10月的预测中也提到了这一点。除了**AI**之外，我们没有出现投资繁荣。然后是重大问题，我们可以考虑很多事情，但**美联储**官员和**特朗普**官员一直在谈论的重大问题是生产力增长。这会产生多少生产力增长？多快？它会取代多少工作？对通胀有什么影响？所以，让我谈谈我的看法。我的观点是，我们正处于接力棒交接的过程中，想象一下夏季奥运会的接力赛，一个跑者把接力棒传给下一个。我认为在**COVID**疫情期间和之后发生的许多劳动力市场变化，没有人事先知道它们会是这样，但事后证明它们有利于生产力增长。工人进行了大量良好的重新配置，我认为这正在耗尽，因为那是一次性的事情。所以现在**AI**正日益成为生产力增长的主要来源。但我也认为，回到你之前关于关税的说法，当你遇到供应冲击，无论是积极的还是消极的，它在价格和实际事物中表现出来多少是不确定的。所以，就像我们讨论关税一样。它可能是一次性的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: but I think people should notice the fact that we haven't had an investment boom. My colleague Karen Dynet Peterson presented on some of this in her forecast in October. We haven't had the investment boom outside of AI. Then the big ticket, there are a number of things we can think about, but the big ticket issue which some Fed officials and Trump officials have been talking about is productivity growth. How much does this generate productivity growth? How soon? How job displacing is it? What's the effect on inflation? So, let me give you my take. My view is we're in the process of the baton sort of being handed in the in the imagine a summer Olympics a relay race and the one runner hands the baton. I think a lot of the labor market changes that took place during and after co nobody knew they would be ex anti but expost they turned out to be pro productivity growth. there was a lot of good reallocation of workers and I think that's running out because that was a one-off thing and so now the AI is the ma is increasingly the main source of the productivity growth but I also think going back to something you were saying earlier about the tariffs when you have a supply shock positive or negative it it's it's indeterminate

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 关税会导致经济衰退，因此不会导致价格通胀吗？我们可以探讨为什么我认为这不对，但你必须以同样的方式思考生产力增长。这是一个积极的供应冲击，但它有多少表现为实际收入增长，有多少表现为反通胀，这需要确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Could it be recessionary from the tariffs and therefore not price inflationary? We can go into why I don't think that's right, but you have to do the same process thinking about productivity growth. It's a positive supply shock, but how much of it shows up as real income gains and how much of it shows up as disinflation has to be determined.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 我对历史的解读是，当你看到通用技术取得飞跃时，你会首先获得实际收入增长，然后才会在后期看到反通胀效应，因为，我的意思是，不是所有的实际收入增长，但最初主要是实际收入增长，因为，再次回到我们之前讨论的内容，企业需要一段时间才能弄清楚如何使用这项技术，如何改变生产流程？如何改变招聘和培训流程？我能提供什么新产品？但有一些很酷的产品，人们会立即想要并使用。所以，如果你想想90年代的互联网，当时**罗伯特·索洛**曾有名地说：“电脑无处不在，但不在统计数据中。”嗯，我们很多人开始使用电脑，获得了生产力提升，但**沃尔玛**、**UPS**和科学公司花了几年时间才弄清楚如何利用这项技术并改变他们的流程。所以，抱歉我说了这么多，但我认为这与你们在 **OddLots** 节目中与一些其他嘉宾讨论的很多内容重叠。这些都是非同小可的商业决策，非同小可的投资决策。所以，如果我坐在**美联储**，是的，理论上，我不知道关税是主要导致衰退还是主要导致通胀，原因我们已经讨论过了。我认为它们从现在开始将主要导致通胀，而不是衰退。如果你谈论**AI**，我认为如果我再次成为中央银行家，我必须做出判断，或者我现在正在做出预测判断，我认为在未来几年你将主要看到实际收入效应，而不是反通胀效应。它们会到来。它们会到来，但它们还没有到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: And my reading of the history is when you get a leap forward in a general purpose technology, you get the real income gains upfront and you get the disinflationary part later because I mean not all the real income gains but it's primarily real income gains initially because what happens again going back to stuff we were talking about it takes businesses a while to figure out how do I use this technology ology, how do I change my production process? How do I change my hiring and training process? What are the new products I can offer? But there's cool products that people want and use right away. So, if you think about the internet in the '90s when Solo famously said, "The computers are everywhere but in the statistics." Well, you know, a bunch of us were starting to use computers, getting productivity gains, but it took several years before Walmart and UPS and science firms figured out how to make use of this and to change their processes. So, sorry to be so long-winded, but I think this is overlaps with a lot of stuff that you hear at OddLots talk about with with some of your some of your other guests. These are non-trivial business decisions, non-trivial investment decisions. And so if I'm sitting at the Fed, yes, in theory, I don't know whether tariffs are going to be mostly recessionary or mostly inflationary for the reasons I've we've discussed. I think they're going to be mostly inflationary starting now and less recessionary. If you're talking about AI, I think if I'm a if I were a central banker again and I had to make a call or I am making a forecast call now, I think you're going to see the real income effects in the next couple years predominantly and not so much the disinflationary effects. Then they're coming. They're coming, but they're not there yet.

### 财政部协议与央行独立性

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们可以回到传导机制和收益率曲线吗？因为我们想采访你的原因之一，不仅仅是因为这份报告，还因为你曾是中央银行家，曾任**英格兰银行**货币政策委员会成员。目前有关于新**财政部协议**的讨论。

There is talk at the moment of a new Treasury accord

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而**凯文·沃什**对此表现出了一些兴趣。所以这基本上会将**美联储**的资产负债表以某种方式与财政部的融资挂钩，大概是为了协调以降低短期利率，并允许财政部发行更多短期国库券，从而降低赤字。

**Joe Weisenthal**: and Wars has kind of signaled some interest in this.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay. [laughter] Explain.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 是的。所以在欧元危机期间，我在**英格兰银行**工作时，我发表了一次演讲，说中央银行的独立性在于说“不”的权力。但你不必总是说“不”，对吧？所以你不想成为，我打了个比方，青少年或幼儿，但我认为我用了青少年。你知道，你不会通过无论父母说什么都不同意来维护你的独立性。所以，**财政部**和**美联储**之间，或者中央银行和财政部之间应该有一些协调的想法并非不合理。但长期存在协议的想法，而不是像金融危机或**COVID**疫情期间那样的紧急应对，才是令人担忧的。这令人担忧，因为如果你回顾关于中央银行独立性的研究，有大量的这方面的数据分析和历史记录，我是那方面文献的众多贡献者之一。结果发现，有两件事可以预测中央银行是否会引发通胀。一是行长或主席是否经常被解雇和替换，超出正常顺序？二是中央银行是否直接从**财政部**购买债券？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Yeah. So during the Euro crisis when I was at Bank of England, I gave a speech that central bank independence is about the power to say no. But you didn't have to always say no, right? So you don't want to be I made the analogy a teenager or a toddler, but I think I use teenager. You know, you you don't assert your independence by no matter what your parent says to you disagreeing. So the idea that there should be some coordination between Treasury and Fed or between the central bank and the finance ministry is not unreasonable. But the idea that there should be an ongoing accord as opposed to say an emergency response during the financial crisis or during COVID is what's scary. And it's scary because if you go back to the work on central bank independence, there's a huge amount of data analysis on this and historical records and I was one of the many contributors to that literature. Turns out there are two things that predict whether a central bank is inflationary or not. it. Yeah. And one is does the governor or the chair get fired and replaced a lot out of turn out of the normal sequence? And the other is does the central bank buy bonds pretty directly from the Treasury.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而且还有关于中央银行独立性的所有其他方面的完整清单，比如投票规则和透明度，这些都没有任何预测能力。但那两件事，你是否直接购买政府债券，以及你高层领导是否频繁更迭，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And [snorts] there's whole lists of all these other aspects of central bank independence about voting rules and transparency and those don't have any predictive power. But those two things, do you do you directly buy government bonds and do you have a lot of turnover at the top leadership

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 确实预示着更高的通胀。我们在最近几年在**土耳其**的**埃尔多安**和**印度**的**莫迪**身上看到了领导层方面的这种情况，他们强行进行了快速更迭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: [snorts] do predict higher inflation and we saw this on the leadership side in with Erdogan and Turkey and Modi in India in recent years where they forced rapid turnover.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **土耳其**到底换了多少位央行行长？有人知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How many central bank heads did Turkey actually go through? Does anyone know?

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 我想是四五个，在**印度**大概是三个，而且都是在非常短的时间内。所以，你知道，我们有一个从 **PAL** 到 **Warsh** 的有序过渡，在 **PAL** 担任主席任期结束时，我的意思是，那不是我们正在谈论的。但我认为重要的是要将**财政部长本特**和政府正在谈论的关于**美联储**的事情置于背景中，这些事情在历史上，在其他国家，随着时间的推移，都导致了高通胀。所以我的意思是，我可以把它说得更复杂，但就此打住。但接下来就出现了这样一个问题：你能在多大程度上通过短期债务管理和金融工程来解决财政问题，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: was four or five I think in India's case it was like three and again in in very short spans of time so you know the idea that we have an orderly transition from PAL to war at the end of Pal's term as chair I mean that's not what we're talking about but I think it is important to contextualize the the things that Treasury Secretary Bent and the administration are talking about visa v the Fed are things that historically over time in other countries have produced high inflation So I mean I can make it more complicated than that but just full stop. But so then there comes the question of how much can you fix a fiscal problem through short-term debt management and financial engineering,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: right?

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 答案是不能。所以通常情况下，你，这涉及到**沃什**和**本特**在2024年大选前公开抱怨的事情，他们抱怨**耶伦财政部**正在

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: And the answer is you can't. So generally you and and this goes to stuff that both Wars and Bent complained about in public going into the elections in 2024 which was they complained that the Yellen Treasury was

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 资助这次财政部发行。是的。然后他们仍然继续发行大量短期国库券。他们做了同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: financing this Treasury issuance. Yeah. And then they they still kept issuing lots of bills. They did the same thing.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 是的。而且，除了指出这种虚伪（我想这是常态的一部分）之外，我认为他们之前所说的比现在所说的更有道理。而且，如果美国财政可持续性方面，你试图做的只是，你知道，获得一笔附带免费烤面包机的贷款来弥补你的月度信用卡账单，那这不是一个好兆头。进行更多的短期发行存在风险。所以，我的意思是，值得回顾几年前，对吧，当时利率极低，**财政部**开始考虑发行100年期债券或非常长期债券，或者至少增加30年期债券的发行量，而不是短期国库券，来为基础设施和长期投资提供资金。当时受到了一个名为**财政部借款人咨询委员会**（**TBAC**）的组织的反对。没错。当时的**财政部长杰克·卢**说：“好吧，我们不做了。”反对意见是双重的。首先，美国政府应该在非常审慎的基础上发行各种期限的债券，以继续维持**美国财政部**作为世界上流动性最强、深度最深、最稳定的资产的国际和国内作用。如果你为了短期利益而操纵它，你就会失去这种作用，这会体现在更高的借贷成本上，因为那时将国债作为国内和国外安全稳定资产的人数会下降，因为它变得不那么安全和稳定了。但当时还有一个理由是，你不知道会发生什么。我的意思是，看看我们从90年代末的盈余到2000年代初的利率上升，再到金融危机后十年间的极低利率，再到现在利率上升的波动。你知道，如果你能借长期，借短期是不明智的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Yeah. And and I beyond pointing out the hypocrisy, which I guess is part for the course, I think they had more validity with what they were saying before than what they're saying now. And and again, it's not a good sign about the fiscal sustainability of the US if what you're trying to do is, you know, get the loan with the free toaster to to bridge over your monthly credit card bill. There is risk to doing more short-term issuance. So, I mean, it's worth thinking back a few years ago, right, when rates were incredibly low and the Treasury started considering issuing 100-year bonds or very long-term bonds or at least increasing the issuance of 30 years versus short bills to fund infrastructure to fund long-term investment. And there was push back from something called the Treasury Borrower Advisory Committee, uh, TBAC. Exactly. And the Treasury Secretary at the time, I think it was Jack Lou, said, "Okay, we're not going to do it." And the push back was twofold. First the general principle that the US government should be issuing across the range of maturities on a very deliberate basis to continue to maintain tre the US Treasury's international and national role as the most liquid most deep most stable asset in the world and that if you start gaming it for short-term advantage you lose that and that will show up in higher borrowing costs because then the number of people who park in treasuries because it's the domestic and foreign because it's the safe stable asset goes down because it's less safe and less stable. But then there was also the the rationale that you don't know what's going to happen. I mean, look at the fluctuations we had from surplus at the end of the 90s to rising interest rates in the early 2000s to incredibly low interest rates for a decade after the financial crisis to now rising. You know, this is not smart if you can borrow long to borrow short.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们正在录制这期节目，当然是在就业日，新的就业日，也就是周三。周三。

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, it feels weird. But we just got some truth social posts out of Trump saying, "These are great job numbers, much better than expected. America should therefore be paying the lowest interest rate."

</details>

### 地缘政治：美国角色与欧洲应对

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们可以继续聊下去。我有很多问题。可以聊很长时间，但我想听听你对**达沃斯**期间，特别是**格陵兰**和**欧洲**等地紧张局势的看法。我想到，这次对话的一个主题，特别是关于关税和移民，是人们不会一下子就下定决心，对吧？企业领导者不会只说：“好的，关税上调了。”因为这些都是重大决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We could go on. I have so many questions. go on a long time, but I wanted to sort of get your take on especially like around Davos, some of the tensions around Greenland and Europe and all that. And it occurs to me like one of the themes of this conversation particularly as it relates to tariffs and also immigration is that people don't make up their minds at once, right? Corporate leaders don't just say, "Okay, tariffs are up." Because these are big decisions

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 而且它们是不确定的。你不知道**特朗普**会不会放弃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and and they're uncertain. You don't know if Trump's going to give it away or not.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，没错。存在巨大的滞后效应，一旦你做出决定，那将是巨大的风险。我一直在思考这个问题，尤其是在**欧洲**的背景下，因为显然**欧洲**仍然与**美国**保持着非常紧密的经济和安全关系。而**欧洲**领导人必须做出一个选择，那就是

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, that's right. There's a huge lag and then once you make the decision, that's like big stakes. And I've been thinking about this like in the context of Europe because obviously Europe still has this very tight economic and security relationship with the United States and the European leaders kind of have to make a bet which is

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **特朗普**是**美国**的新常态，还是下一任总统会采取一种与前任总统相似的经济和安全姿态？没有人真正确定，但这是一个高风险的选择，因为如果下一任总统在这些问题上更“正常”，那么也许，你知道，你只需要在未来几年忍受一下。或者在某个时候，如果关系将发生巨大变化，**欧洲**真的需要重新思考它在军事上花费多少，也许重新思考，“哦，我们是否想要与**中国**建立更紧密的关系，无论是什么？”这是一个重大的决定。所以，我很好奇你的看法，**欧洲**领导人现在还没有对**美国**“拉响警报”。有很多挫折感，但他们还没有。我们仍然保持着这种紧密的关系。我们是否越来越接近**欧洲**领导人可能会认为，“看，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: is Trump the new normal here in the United States or will the next president uh have a adopt a posture an economic and security posture that's sort of like the old presidents and no one no one really knows for sure but this is like a high consequence choice to make because if the next president is going to be sort of a more, you know, more normie on this stuff, then maybe, you know what, you just sort of grin and bear it for the next few years. And then, or at some point, if the relationship is going to be dramatically changed, Europe really needs to rethink like how much it spends on military and maybe rethink about, oh, do we want a closer orientation with China, whatever it is. And uh there's a big decision to make. So, I'm curious like your take like European leaders right now, they haven't pulled the rip cord yet on the United States. There's a lot of frustration, but they haven't. We had we still have this tight relationship. Is it are we getting closer to where European leaders might think look

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这永远不会回到过去了。也许**卡尼**的演讲就像是“我们永远不会回到与**美国**的旧关系了。我们生活在一个新世界。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: this is never going to go back maybe sort of the carney speech is like we're never going to go back to the old relationship with the United States. We're in a new world.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: **Joe**，这是一个非常宏大的问题，我一直在撰写文章并与**欧洲**领导人讨论这个问题。我去年9月在《**外交事务**》上发表了一篇文章，题为《新经济地理》，其中我谈到，我主张这是一个根本性的、持久的变化，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: It is the great big picture question Joe and I have been writing on this and talking with European leaders on this. I published a piece in Foreign Affairs in September called the new economic geography in which I talked about if I argued that this is a fundamental lasting change

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 因为**美国**正在停止扮演它过去在安全和经济方面的“保险提供者”角色。我认为，无论现任政府的继任者是谁，即使是另一位**共和党**人、一位**民主党**人，某种新党派的中间派，无论是什么，都不可能立即可信地扭转所有已经说过和做过的事情，这是非常公平和现实的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: because the US is ceasing to be the insurance provider in both security and economic terms that it was and that I think it's very fair to say and realistic whatever happens in terms of successor to the current administration, even if the successor administration, whether it's another Republican, a Democrat, some kind of new party centrist, whatever it is, is not going to immediately credibly reverse everything that's been said and done. [clears throat]

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 所以，你刚才给出的类比，我认为是正确的。而且，**迪克西特**和**平迪克**有一项关于投资的经济学基本理论，即不确定性下的投资你会延迟，因为从某种意义上说，一旦你做出决定并走上某条道路，它是不可逆转的。它并非字面意义上的不可逆转，但它会把你锁定。这不仅仅是沉没成本谬误，它是理性的。所以从抽象到现实，我们即将迎来新的**慕尼黑安全会议**，一年一度的慕尼黑安全会议。在2024年3月，副总统**J.D.万斯**在那里发表了演讲，以及前一周在**巴黎**，他基本上

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: And so it's analogous, the parallel you you were giving, I think is right. And [clears throat] there's a fundamental economic theory by Dixon and Pindik called um about investment that investment under uncertainty you delay because in a sense it's irreversible once you once once something happens and you commit down a certain path. It's not literally irreversible but it it it locks you in. It's not just sunk cost fallacy. It's rational. So going from the abstract to the real, we're we're coming up on the new Munich Security Conference, annual Munich Security Conference. And in March 2024, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech there and the preceding week in Paris in which he basically

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 2025年3月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: March 2025.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 2025年，抱歉。对。我们现在是2026年。你说的完全正确。2025年3月。他基本上说，你知道，**北约**，**乌克兰**，但**北约**不能再像以前那样指望我们了。他给出了为什么这对**北约**和**美国**都有好处的论点。我们可以对此进行辩论，但这确实是一个非常令人震惊的巨大转变。然后正如你所提到的，首相**马克·卡尼**，现在是世界上最著名的前中央银行家，几周前在**达沃斯**发表了一次演讲，其中很大一部分是试图为**加拿大**说明，我们所有人赖以运作的这个框架普遍丧失了。有趣的是，大约一年前，我被**加拿大**政府邀请到**渥太华**，向他们简要介绍了**特朗普**可能带来的影响。那是在**卡尼**从被任命到成为常任首相的选举之前。但无论如何，当时我，你知道，我正在与绝对震惊的**加拿大人**打交道。就像你说的，对吧？所以，在**特朗普**第一次执政期间，人们说，不要理会，有成年人在场。也许会改变。在**拜登**执政期间，情况确实有所改变，但在关税和许多事情上，它一直是一个单向的棘轮。它们没有回头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: 2025, sorry. Right. We're in 2026. You're absolutely right. March 2025. in which he basically said, you know, NATO, Ukraine, but NATO cannot count on us the way they used to. And he gave arguments for why why that was good for NATO and good for the US and all that. We can debate that, but the it was a very shocking big shift. And then as you mentioned, Prime Minister Carney, now the most famous ex- central banker in the world, um gave a speech in Davos a few weeks ago which was very much about the trying to say for Canada, it was a general loss of this framework that we've all functioned in. And interestingly, almost exactly a year ago, I was in Ottawa brought in by the Canadian government to brief them on the likely implications of the Trump. It was right before the election where Carney moved from appointed to ongoing prime minister. But anyway, at that time, I I you know, I was dealing with absolutely shocked Canadians and like you said, right? So, the first time during Trump's one, people said discounting the adults are in the room. Maybe it'll change. Under Biden, things did change, but on tariffs and a lot of things, it had been a one-way ratchet. They didn't go back.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 他们对很多**IRA**（通胀削减法案）的事情感到不满。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: They were upset about a lot of the IRA stuff.

</details>

**Adam Posen**: 绝对如此。而且它是单方面的，我认为是短视的，但无论如何。**拜登**团队做了很多糟糕的事情，也继续做了很多糟糕的事情。他们在安全方面没有那么敌对。他们在跨大西洋方面是如此，但在经济方面，他们并没有真正回滚。在某些方面，他们使**特朗普**赢得的一些东西变得更糟。所以，当你回到一年前，甚至在**万斯**的慕尼黑演讲之前，**加拿大人**就在自言自语：“天哪，这是一个完美的例子。我们刚刚意识到我们没有不经过**美国**的互联网管道。我们要么有**美国**卫星，要么有**美国**电缆。没有**美国**的许可，我们根本无法访问互联网。”这概括了正在发生的事情，对吧？你曾认为，如果你不是**俄罗斯**或**伊朗**，**美国**就不会对你武器化，但这不再是可行的事情了。所以具体到**欧洲**，这是自战争以来**欧洲**面临的最大挑战。在这种情况下，许多**欧洲**官员，与你**Joe**的描述非常一致，一年前，他们仍然处于否认状态，或者仍然与我这样的人进行大量对话，讨论“这会持续下去吗？我们能熬过去吗？这会好转吗？”现在，没有人相信它会好转，或者至少没有人相信它会充分好转并持续下去，以至于**欧洲人**可以像过去那样理所当然地指望下一任领导人。现在，**特朗普**的支持者会说这很好。他们不再把我们视为理所当然。但从经济角度来看，世界大部分地区能够认为**美国**在执行游戏规则，提供基本的航海安全、财产权、贸易关系以及进出**美国国债**、进出**美国**市场的便利，这是一件好事。我们把这一切都视为理所当然，这对商业、投资和双向贸易都是巨大的福音。所以，这是一个非常大的问题，因此**欧洲**的一些人正在参与各种项目，试图找出下一步该怎么做。我的两位**彼得森国际经济研究所**的同事非常活跃。著名的法国经济学家**奥利维尔·布兰查德**现在回到了**法国**，他正在领导一项关于**欧洲**未来的工作。我的同事**雅各布·柯克加德**常驻**布鲁塞尔**，他做了很多关于**欧洲**共同资金投入军事的多少以及其可持续性的工作。重要的一点，**雅各布**指出的一点是，**欧洲**内部确实存在分歧，与其说他们不信任**特朗普**或不信任**美国**，对**美国**失去信心，不如说他们对**普京**等军事威胁的紧迫性看法不同。所以这些国家在军事上的支出量是与它们离**俄罗斯**有多近呈递减关系的。我的意思是，你可以直接画出散点图。**波兰**、**波罗的海国家**、**瑞典人**和**挪威人**（**挪威**不属于**欧洲**，但属于**北约**）的支出要多得多。**德国**居中。**西班牙**和**葡萄牙**没有支出。但你又回到了地缘政治真正重要的世界。最后我想说的是，因为我们即将迎来**慕尼黑安全会议**，在此之前，**德国**的**默茨**和**法国**的**马克龙**宣布了一项新提议，即成立一个**欧洲**领导委员会，向前推进。所以它将包括**德国**、**法国**、**波兰**、**西班牙**、**意大利**，基本上是大国加上**荷兰**。这在**欧洲**几十年来都是不可能的，因为事情必须让所有人参与。事情必须通过合格多数或一致同意来完成。而这表明问题发展太快了。我们必须站起来。所以我的观点，最终比许多**欧洲人**更乐观，是**欧洲**选择做什么，他们有很大的自主权。他们将在很大程度上决定事情对他们和世界其他地区有多糟糕，因为**特朗普**和**习**最终会推行类似的糟糕经济政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Posen**: Absolutely. And it was unilateral and I think shortsighted, but anyway. And the Biden team did a lot of bad, continued a lot of bad things and did a lot of bad things. They weren't as hostile on the security front. They were transatlanticist there, but on the economic front, they didn't really roll back. And in some ways they made worse some of what Trump won in. And so by the time you get to a year ago, which is even before Vance's Munich speech, the Canadians are saying to themselves, "Oh my god, we this is a perfect example. We we we just realized we have no internet pipes that don't run through the US. We either have US satellites or we have US cables. We literally have no access to the internet without the US permission." And that encapsulates what's going on, right? that you took for granted that if you were not Russia or Iran, the US would not weaponize things against you and that's no longer a feasible thing. So going specifically to Europe, this is the biggest challenge to Europe since the war. This is a situation where a lot of European officials, very much in line with your characterization, Joe, a year ago, we're still in denial or we're still having a lot of conversations with people like me about is this going to last? Can we wait it out? Is this going to turn around? At this point, nobody believes it's going to turn around, or at least nobody believes it's going to turn around sufficiently and last in a way that the Europeans can count on whoever's next the same way they took for granted. Now, the Trump people would say that's good. They're not taking us for granted. But from an economic point of view that it was a good thing that large parts of the world could take the US enforcing the rules of the game, providing some basic security of navigating the seas and property rights and trade relations and access in and out of treasuries, access in and out of US markets. That we took all that for granted was a huge boon to business. It was a huge boon to investment. It was a huge boon to two-way trade. So this is a very big deal and so a number of people in Europe are involved in various projects trying to come up with what's next and two colleagues of mine at Peterson are very active. Olivier Blanchard the famous French economist who's now back in France is leading an effort on what future for Europe. My colleague Jacob Kirkagard who's based in Brussels does a lot of work on how much common European funding is going into the military and how sustainable is that. The big thing, one of the things Jacob points out is you do have a split in Europe, not so much about how much they distrust Trump or distrust the US, lost faith in the US, but over how imminent they see the military threat from say Putin. So the amount of spending that these countries are doing on military is a declining function of how close they are to Russia. I mean you can literally do the scatter plot. Poland and the Baltics and Swedes and the Norwegians. Nor Norway is not part of Europe. It's part of NAO anyway are spending a lot more. Germany's in the middle. Spain and Portugal are not spending. But you're back in a world of that kind of re geo and geopolitics really mattering. And the final thing I would say in this because we're coming up on the Munich Security Conference is ahead of this there was an announcement of a new idea backed by merits in Germany and Mcronone in France of sort of a leadership committee in Europe moving ahead. So it would be Germany, France, Poland, Spain, Italy, basically the big countries plus Netherlands. And that was a nogo for decades in Europe that that things had to be done by involving everybody. Things had to be done by qualified majority or unonymity. And this is a statement problems are moving too fast. We have to stand up. And so my view, which is ultimately more optimistic than a lot of Europeans, is that what Europe chooses to do, they have a lot of agency. They will have a lot to determine the outcome of how bad things go for them and for the rest of the world as Trump and she end up pursuing similar bad economic policies.

### 结论：通胀前景与地缘政治支出

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，我认为这是一次很棒的对话。你最后提出的观点与他说的关于安全与宏观经济之间联系的话不谋而合。我一直在思考这个观察。我们肯定应该在这方面做更多工作。你知道，**加拿大**除非通过**美国**，否则无法访问互联网。那么，如何解决这个问题？嗯，你得花钱，你得建造新的管道，你得建造新的海底电缆，你得建造更多的卫星，但那都是支出，对吧？那是通胀性的。所以，你知道，这和我们与**杰夫·库里**谈论的情况一样。**欧洲**在国防上花费数万亿美元。这些担忧是关于各国在多大程度上还能依赖**美国**。解决这些担忧的方法就是投入更多的支出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy, I thought that was a great conversation. Your point there at the end dovetailed with something else he said about the sort of the link now between security and macro. I was thinking about that observation. We should definitely do more on this. You know, Canada not having access to the internet unless it's through the US. So, how do you solve that? Well, like you spend and you build new pipes, you build new undersea cables, you build more satellites, but that's spending, right? That's inflationary. Yeah. And so, you know, again, it's the same thing with, we talked about it with Jeff Curry. Europe spending trillions on defense. These concerns about whether the degree to which countries can rely on the US anymore. The way you address these concerns is a lot more spending.

**Tracy Alloway**: 绝对如此。对我来说，我们确实看到了一些通胀迹象，对吧？就像我们一开始谈到的那样，你真的不能忽视它们。我想最大的问题是，这其中有多少是暂时的，比如库存回补？你知道，也许人们去年一整年都在消耗库存，因为他们不确定关税会发生什么，但现在他们真的必须重新储备，所以你正在经历这种一次性的通胀上涨，或者这是否是某种，我知道我们一直在用“持久”这个词，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Absolutely. To me, we are seeing some inflationary signs, right? like we talked about them at the beginning and you can't really ignore them. I guess the the big question is how much of this is like a temporary like blip in terms of building back inventories. you know, maybe people ran them down all last year because they didn't know exactly what was going to happen with tariffs, but now now they really have to stock back up and so you're getting this like onetime inflationary hike or is this the start of something that's kind of I know we keep using the word durable.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，但这是正确的。是的，完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, but it is the right qu Yeah, totally.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 而且如果你看看卡车运输费率之类的东西，再次强调，我们对卡车运输费率很感兴趣。我们做了很多关于它的节目，但它们也是一个很好的宏观经济指标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And like if you look at something like trucking rates and again like we're interested in trucking rates. We did a lot of episodes on it, but also they're just a good macroeconomic indicator.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们看到了一些复苏的迹象。所以运费开始上涨，但大家都在说，我们需要看到六周的持续改善。所以我认为这就像现在的问题一样，2月11日，我们是否会在未来一两个月看到更多持续的通胀指标？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We've seen some glimmers of a recovery there. So freight rates are starting to go up, but everyone's kind of saying, well, we need to see like 6 weeks of sustained improvement. So I think that's kind of like the question right now, February 11th, do we get more sustained inflationary indicators over the next month or two?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 绝对如此。而且，你知道，即使我们一个月前进行这次对话，当时就业市场软化的说法可能不那么明确。你会想，新的**美联储**主席会怎么做？是不是需要立即降息？比如25个基点，50个基点？也许可以再低一点。如果出现再加速，那也不是世界末日。如果我们真的看到势头再次增强，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Absolutely. And um you know again I you know it's interesting even if we had had this conversation say a month ago or something like that when you know it looked like maybe there was more you know the the the story of job market softening was less unambiguous or something like that. You think about the new Fed chair it's like okay do we need rate cuts right away it's like ah 25 basis points 50 basis point maybe they could be a little lower. It's not the end of the world if there is a reaceleration. If we actually are seeing gathering steam again

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而即将上任的**美联储**主席仍然有这种冲动，认为你必须降息，你必须建立。我的意思是**特朗普**开玩笑说，但那不是真正的玩笑。他说：“哦，如果**凯文·沃什**不降息，我就起诉他。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and the incoming Fed chair still has this impulse that like you have to like cut rates, you have to establish. I mean Trump joked, but not really a joke. He's like, "Oh, I'd sue if Kevin Worsh doesn't cut rates."

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 如果你在我们实际看到加速的时期进行降息，那将是一个非常不同的故事，而且会非常，是的，火上浇油。所以，外面有很多有趣的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: If you have this sort of rate cuts into a period of we're actually seeing acceleration that's like a very different story and very Yeah. put more fuel on the fire. So, a lot of sort of interesting risks out there.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。即使劳动力市场正在软化，人们对降息也有些矛盾。是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. People were kind of ambivalent about a rate cut even when the labor market was softening. Yeah, exactly.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 然后如果你说要在经济加速时降息，那么，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And then if you say you're going to cut rates when it's reacelerating, well,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们可以继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: we could go on.
