### 美联储主席提名：凯文·沃尔什的崛起与政策预示

本周市场经历了历史性的事件，其中之一是关于未来美联储主席的提名。在过去几个月里，美联储主席的竞逐过程跌宕起伏。起初，**凯文·哈塞特 (Kevin Hassett)** 似乎处于领先地位，他曾长期担任总统的经济顾问，并在其执政初期担任经济顾问委员会主席，现为某机构的总裁，是一位总统可以信赖的经济学家，被认为会支持降息。然而，几周前总统在新闻发布会上公开表示哈塞特可能不会被提名，这为竞选格局带来了变数。

回顾来看，哈塞特可能因其与总统的“过于忠诚”的形象，以及围绕其的“刑事指控”传闻，使得部分共和党参议员在确认提名时有所顾虑。在哈塞特出局后，竞争主要集中在两位候选人之间：一是**贝莱德 (BlackRock)** 的首席投资官 **里克·里尔 (Rick Reer)**，二是**凯文·沃尔什 (Kevin Walsh)**。沃尔什曾是美联储的理事，并在金融危机期间担任过重要职务，甚至在总统的第一任期内曾被考虑提名。

里尔是一位被认为非常聪明且有见地的金融系统专家，但他的一些政治捐款记录（曾捐款给民主党及共和党内的**妮基·黑利 (Nikki Haley)**）以及与总统缺乏紧密关系，可能成为他获得提名的障碍。相比之下，凯文·沃尔什的背景则显得更为“鹰派”。他职业生涯中始终是**鹰派 (hawk)** 的代表，频繁强调美联储资产负债表规模过大可能引发通胀。尽管在金融危机初期，他曾错误地认为金融体系“完全没问题”而担忧通胀，但在危机后，即使在失业率高企的情况下，他依然将通胀作为首要关切，这显示了他对通胀的持续担忧，以及可能未能及时更新其经济模型。

然而，沃尔什的提名也得益于其强大的社交网络。他的岳父是**雅诗兰黛 (Estee Lauder)** 的亿万富翁**罗德·劳德 (Lauder)**，并且是总统及共和党的重要政治捐助者。在过去几个月里，沃尔什的广泛人脉积极为其“站台”，众多有影响力的人物纷纷发声支持，这似乎最终帮助他赢得了提名。

沃尔什担任美联储主席的潜在影响是深远的。他最明确的目标之一是缩减美联储的资产负债表。尽管一些人认为这在当前政治环境下难以实现，但演讲者认为，缩减资产负债表是特朗普政府内部的共识，包括财政部长**史蒂文·姆努钦 (Steven Mnuchin)**、理事**鲍曼 (Bowman)** 和**迈恩特 (Miant)** 等人都支持这一举措。这并非利率政策或美联储独立性问题，而是他们希望推行的政策。这一过程需要大量前期准备工作，可能涉及放松监管，并可能在市场波动中进行，除非操作极其缓慢。演讲者认为，这本质上是一种**风险负面 (risk negative)** 的操作。沃尔什本人也公开表示，资产负债表的收缩将产生紧缩效应，这也是他认为可以降息的原因之一。

市场对沃尔什的提名反应复杂，短期内收益率曲线趋陡，暗示可能增加降息预期，但长期利率有所下跌，可能与资产负债表缩减的担忧有关。同时，美元也出现膝跳式走强。

This past week was a historic week. Not only did we get a new Fed share nominee, we also had a historic implosion in the precious metals, especially silver, down 30% in one day. So I think these two are linked but just by a little bit. So today let's talk about two things. First off, let's talk about who a future chair is. And secondly, let's talk about the precious metals.

Starting with Kevin Walsh. So, over the past few months, it's been a roller coaster when it comes to the Fed chair race. Now, for most part, Kevin Hassett was in the lead, and he was also who I thought would be Fed Chair. Now, Kevin Hassett was someone who had been with the president for a decade. He was the president's economist, chair of economic advisors during the president's first term and right now he is president of another high policymaking role. He's been the president's loyal economist for a long time, so it stood to reason that he would be the president's future nominee, was someone the president could trust to try to cut rates as much as possible. But a couple weeks ago, the president went out of his way at a press conference to make the comment that it's probably not going to be Hassett. Now, after in retrospect, it seems like the kerfuffle with the criminal allegations against the Fed may have made some Republican senators less willing to confirm nominees that are perceived to be too loyal to the president. So, that might have hurt him.

So after Kevin Hassett was out of the picture, the race came down to either Rick Reer, CIO at BlackRock, or Kevin Walsh, who was formerly a governor at the Fed during the great financial crisis and almost nominated by the president to be Fed Chair during his first term. Now, I've written about both of these guys, and it to me it was kind of a neck-to-neck race. I wasn't really sure what would happen. Now Rick Reer, I thought was someone who was actually very smart, very thoughtful, had a good understanding of how the financial system worked today. But against him was that he previously had donated to Democrats and doesn't have a really much of a relationship with the president and also even donated to Nikki Haley in the past, who also just not friends with the president. So it was going to be difficult for the person to trust, entrust such an important job to this person who had such no clear ties to him, even though maybe he's from a policy standpoint maybe on the same page.

Now Kevin Walsh has always been someone who I thought was bizarre that the president would like him and I think many people feel this way as well. The reason being that Kevin Walsh has been a hawk his entire career. Now he has been governor in the past and we can look from his previous statements, declassified meeting transcripts and also he's been in public life just in podcast and lectures and op-eds and so forth for a long time and it's really clear who he is. He is a ginormous hawk, always talking about the Fed's balance sheet too big and thinking that this would cause inflation and whatnot. Now, Anna Wong from Bloomberg Economics had a really good chart overlaying the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and some of comments from Kevin Walsh during the great financial crisis. Now, heading into the GFC, Kevin Walsh was like, "Financial system totally okay, guys. But by the way, I'm worried about inflation." And in retrospect, obviously, the financial system was not totally okay. But everyone made that mistake, right? Ben Bernanke made that mistake. I think Ben Bernanke did a really good job as Fed chair, right? Totally great crisis fighter. So after the great financial crisis, unemployment rate close to 10%, we were in the beginning of the great recession. Kevin Walsh, smart guy, obviously he updated his priorities, right? He learned, right? So well actually no. Even with the unemployment rate at multi-decade highs, Kevin Walsh was like, you know, I'm kind of concerned about inflation. So that was a call that was wrong, right? It seems like his primary driver of his concern over inflation over the past decade was that the Fed's balance sheet, and that was also a totally reasonable stance, right? There were people who had a monetarist view of the world saying that hey Fed expanding its balance sheet, printing a lot of money, increasing money supply, we're going to have a lot of inflation, right? And at that time gold prices were surging. There was legitimate concern from very many smart people. Okay. Um, but after a decade of this now we can see that that's actually not how the world works. Did Kevin update his mental model? No. No. He's still saying the exact same thing. So he's someone who's consistently hawkish and someone who also is not able to update mental models. Though that's kind of concerning. But for whatever reason, you know, president likes him. I think over the past few months he's also moderated his stance. Has been talking about we got a productivity America so we're going to be able to cut rates and so forth, right, saying the right things. But I think it's also very important to note that his father-in-law is Mr. Louder of Estee Lauder fame, billionaire and also someone who has been a big political donor to the president to the Republican party for a long time. And also Walsh is extremely well-connected. He knows a lot of influential people and these influential people over the past few months all came to bat for him. So there's a very, very wide campaign behind the scenes where we had all these important people that you would know, you would recognize, come and just give put in a good word for Kevin Walsh. In contrast, you know, Kevin Hassett did not have the same network. Um, also, you know, perceived to be difficult to confirm. Rick Reer didn't seem to campaign as hard. So Kevin Walsh definitely ran a very good campaign about this. And upon his nomination, you can see on Twitter, you had all these people congratulating him, right? So you got Muhammad Alan, you got Jason Ferman, you got even Mark Carney, prime minister of Canada, all these people pouring out congratulating Kevin Walsh, great guy. These are all people in his network. He is super well-connected and all these people pulled for him and that seemed to have pushed him across the finish line.

So what does a chair Walsh Fed mean? So, first and foremost, he's finally going to be able to complete his dream of shrinking the Fed's balance sheet. You know, there's a lot of people saying that this will never happen. This is ridiculous. You know, Trump loves the stock market and so forth. So, I think those people are going to be wrong. Uh, the reason I think they're wrong is that a smaller Fed balance sheet is actually a consensus position in the Trump administration. Secretary Mnuchin believes in this. Governor Bowman believes in this. Governor Mian believes in this. This is something they want to do and this is something they can do. This is not interest rate policy. It's not a Fed independence issue. So I think we have enough heft to do this. Question is why they want to. I don't know. Now the process doing this requires a lot of groundwork because it's going to be a fundamental transformation in how policy is implemented. So you're going to have to have a lot of banking deregulation which they're on to doing and you're going to have probably some volatility in the markets unless you do it very, very slowly. Now this is in my view probably going to be risk negative, depending on how smooth the banking regulations go forth. So I know the thing is Kevin Walsh openly tells you that he's going to, he thinks that the strength in the balance sheet it's going to be a tightening impact and that's part of reason why he thinks he can cut rates. So, it's all out in the open. This is really what they want to do. And I'll probably talk more about or write about this this week about how I think this could happen and what the implications were. But overall, I think this is risk negative. Now, the market took a look at this nomination, surprised a bit. I guess this guy is like the harsh person of all the president's candidates. And so, you had an immediate reaction where you had the curve steepen a bit. So more rate cuts, but you know the longer end sells off a bit probably because of balance sheet thing. Uh, and also you have the dollar knee-jerk strengthening.

### 贵金属市场剧变：白银的投机泡沫与黄金的避险价值

这引出了我们第二个话题：贵金属市场的全面崩溃。过去几周，我们一直在讨论贵金属，尤其是白银。正如我反复指出的，白银是“原始的模因币 (meme coin)”。散户投机者非常喜爱白银。在过去几十年里，白银周期性地飙升至“月球”，然后又崩盘。这种情况发生在 20 世纪 80 年代和 21 世纪 10 年代。我记得当时我曾从白银中赚了很多钱，然后在一个周日晚上，环球交易所 (GlobeEx) 开盘，一切都崩盘了。当时曾试图重回 50 美元的高点，但最终失败并彻底崩盘，那是一段痛苦的经历。

看到白银再次出现极端飙升，我本能地知道这种情况会再次发生。这就是市场的运作方式，新一代人正在学习投机。本周早些时候，我发帖说要去卖掉一些实物白银。我当时持有大量纸质白银，看着价格飙升，我认为那天大概在 110-115 美元，我觉得这太荒谬了。然后我看着我手里的银条，心想我为什么要持有这些？说实话，它们就放在地上，压在电线前面，以免我的机器人吸尘器啃咬电线。有时我用银条来敲打东西。我看过一些令人信服的视频说它对付狼人非常有效，但除此之外，这东西就是一块巨大的石头。

设想一下，在一个“疯狂的麦克斯 (Mad Max)”式的世界里，这些东西有什么用？完全没用。有用的会是像技术这样的东西。如果我们生活在“疯狂的麦克斯”世界，将不再有电脑或手机。这些东西制造起来非常非常困难，需要数百家供应商和大量工程师，它们是我们技术文明的巅峰。而在“疯狂的麦克斯”世界里，你将无法再制造这些高科技产品。所以，有用的东西会是这些，而不是一块石头。即使你考虑持有某种价值储存手段，白银也不是一个好选择，因为它太重了。一根 100 盎司的银条价值约 1 万美元，但它很重，难以携带。相比之下，黄金会是更好的选择。

于是，我带着我的银条去了当地的经销商，他给我的报价比市价低了 15-20%。但我还是卖了。然后我发帖，回来后看到我的帖子有多火，评论有多少，我心想：“天哪，我还不够看跌。”所有这些低信息量的投资者都在涌入。于是第二天，我又去卖了另一根银条。令我惊讶的是，经销商告诉我他不再收购了。他说，卖的人太多了，他供货的铸造厂也需要两个月才能付款给他，他的金库满了。我不得不去其他几家经销商那里寻找买家来处理我的银条。我还注意到，在排队卖银的人群中，绝大多数是“婴儿潮一代 (boomers)”，他们似乎已经囤积了很长时间。而在窗口购买白银的，只有一个“Z世代 (zoomer)”。我当时想，这大概是学习过程的一部分吧。

在网上，我注意到人们说：“伙计们，这不是顶部！这不是顶部！你知道为什么吗？因为在顶部时，每个人都在争相购买。每个人都在试图卖出。所以，这显然不是顶部。”我思考了一会儿。但是，如果我想卖掉白银却卖不掉，那怎么会是风险正面的呢？还有各种其他错误信息。例如，有人说我的经销商会以高于市价的价格收购白银，这太愚蠢了。经销商的工作方式和国债市场经销商一样。假设市价是 100，他会以低于市价的价格买入，以高于市价的价格卖出。他赚取的就是这个差价。买入低，卖出高，这就是他们赚钱的方式。

对我来说，这简直是疯狂的。我记得当时很多人出来说：“你难道不明白吗？法定货币 (fiat) 正在走向零。你难道不明白吗？中国人正在购买。你难道不明白吗？银行正在做空，我们要把它们搞垮。”但这些人没有意识到，在 21 世纪 10 年代，人们说过同样的话。他们在我买入并涨到 50 美元时说过，在跌到 15 美元时也说过。更令人惊讶的是，当我回顾 20 世纪 80 年代**亨特兄弟 (Hunts brothers)** 试图操纵白银价格时，情况也差不多。通胀高企，赤字巨大。“伙计们，这是你的货币贬值交易。”他们一路说到了 50 美元，然后又一路跌到了 7 美元。所以，这种情况一次又一次地发生。这一切都是投机、动量和杠杆，极其不稳定。

当一个非常不稳定的事物出现时，只需要一点点推动，就可能压垮它。而这正是凯文·沃尔什的鹰派立场所做的。美元走强（幅度不大，但对市场有影响），然后似乎就引发了一系列连锁反应。波动性增加，有人开始卖出，市场过度杠杆化，其他人被迫卖出，然后那些根据波动性进行管理的人不得不卖出。**商品交易顾问 (CTAs)** 看到动量指标，他们也必须卖出。每个人都在卖出，然后市场变得非常混乱，这正是发生的事情。一天下跌 30%，这载入史册了。这对我来说非常震惊，它竟然会如此糟糕地发展。但也显示了他们系统中有多少杠杆。

顺带一提，有些人曾说白银会涨到几百美元，这永远不会发生。他们说那是因为白银不同于其他人们投机的“垃圾”。白银实际上是一种工业金属。像模因币、狗狗币这样的东西，你可以推高到任何你想要的高度，没人会在意。但白银与工业政策、国家安全等有关。因此，政府不会允许投机者将其价格推得太高，因为它会影响许多重要的利益相关者。所以在 20 世纪 80 年代，很多人联合起来操纵了市场，导致了崩盘。当然，还有巨大的保证金追缴，以及只允许卖出而不允许买入等措施。

如果你想推高某种资产，我认为黄金更有可能。这些工业金属，你是在与政治经济学对抗。当然，黄金也经历了巨大的下跌，下跌了 10%。但我对黄金的看法不那么悲观。我认为今年黄金仍有可能创下新高。似乎有很多因素在起作用。动态类似，但杠杆较低，且需求基础更强。你确实有像央行或其他更保守的投资者在购买黄金。央行不会购买白银，那不是他们的购买对象。所以，我最好的猜测是，白银可能会尝试向上波动，也许不会触及 100 美元，然后就会结束，直到再次看到几十年后的白银图表。然而，我对黄金则更为乐观，不太担心它。

有一点对黄金有利，那就是当前地缘政治风险正在升温。上周，一艘航空母舰进入了中东地区，似乎他们打算在那里采取行动。这可能不会像委内瑞拉那样。总统在使用军事力量方面一直非常谨慎。顺便说一句，这与“Mega (AI 领域)”无关。但这些计算是困难的。地缘政治存在巨大的不确定性，很多事情难以预测。我们不知道会发生什么。所以，情况可能会非常糟糕，而这可能会提振黄金。总之，这是历史性的一周。好了，下周再聊。

And that leads us to our second topic, the total implosion in the precious metals market. So listen, we've been talking about the precious metals, silver in particular, for the past few weeks. Now silver, as I've noted over and over again, is the original meme coin. Retail speculators love silver, right? Um, and silver over the past few decades, you can see that periodically it just surges to the moon and then it implodes. Happened in the 1980s, happened in the 2010s. And I know this because I was in silver at that time, you know, making a lot of money. And then I remember distinctly one Sunday evening a GlobeEx opened and it just all came crashing down and there was an attempt to recapture the highs, 50 at that time, and then it just lost that and then just totally imploded. It was a painful experience. So looking at this extreme, extreme surges in silver again, I instinctively knew that this is going to happen again. This is just how markets work. It's just a new generation understanding and learning about speculation. So over earlier in the week I posted this that guys I'm going to go and sell some physical silver. I was already a lot of my paper silver and looking at prices surge, I think at that day was like 110, 115. I was like this is totally ridiculous. And then I was looking at the silver bars that I had. Why am I holding this? You know, if you really think about it, I mean, what am I using this stuff for? Honestly, it's on the ground in front of some wires so that my robot vacuum will not be chomping on the wires. Sometimes I use silver bars to hammer something. I've watched some convincing footage that says it's very effective against werewolves, but other than that, you know, this stuff is this stuff is just it's just a huge rock, right?

So, so what do I what am I doing with this in some weird bizarre scenario where we actually have a MadMax world? This is totally not useful. What would be useful with something like a technology for example, right? If we live in a MadMax world, you we're not going to have any more computers or cell phones. And this stuff, this stuff is really, really difficult to make. It takes hundreds of vendors, a lot of engineers. It's basically the pinnacle of our technological civilization. And if in the MadMax world, you won't be able to make these texts up anymore. So you would have these useful things, not this rock. And even if you were, you know, thinking about having a sort of value, silver isn't actually that good for that. Uh, because it's too heavy. And if you, you know, a 100 bar, it's like 10 grand, but it's heavy. You can't really move it around. You would, gold, for example, would be much, much better for that. So, I went and took my silver bar and to the local dealer and he offered me, you know, actually notably below spot. Nice, like 15, 20 below spot, but I took it anyway. And then I posted and I came back and I saw how viral my post had gone. I saw the comments and I'm like, "Holy, I'm not bearish enough. All these these low information investors just kind of clamoring in." And so the next day I went to try to sell another bar. And to my surprise, the dealer actually told me that he's not buying. He was not buying. Too many people selling is the foundry that he sells to also can't pay him for like two months. His vault is full. So he he's not. So I have to actually go to a couple other dealers to try to find people to to um to offload my my bars. And I'll also note that when I was lining up in line to try to sell silver, there's a long line of people selling and basically all boomers with their you know who've been stacking for some time it seems. Uh, in the window to buy silver, only one person, a zoomer. So I was like, yeah, this is just part of learning, I guess.

So uh, in the internet I noticed that people were saying, guys, it's not the top, it's not the top. You know why? It's because at the top, everyone is climbing to buy. Everyone's trying to sell. So obviously it's not the top. You know, I thought about that for a little bit. But then guys, if I want to sell silver and I can't even sell, that can't be that can't be risk positive, right? And all sorts of other just misinformation like that. For example, there's some people saying that I'm actually being able to my dealer is buying silver above spot. That's just so stupid, guys. That's totally not what how a dealer works. A dealer works same thing as a dealer in the treasuries market. For example, let's say that spot is 100. He's going to buy below spot and sell above spot. He makes that spread. That's how he makes his money. Buying low, selling high, you know, bid ask, bid offer and so forth, right? That's how dealers work. So, um, so to me, this is just totally totally insane. Now, I remember all these people coming out and I mean, don't you get it? Uh, fiat is going to zero. Don't you get it? You know, the Chinese are buying. Don't you get it? Right. Uh, this stuff the banks are short. We're going to blow them up and so forth. Now, what these guys don't get, though, is that back in the 2010s, people said the exact same thing. I'm not even joking. They said the exact same thing as everyone was buying into 50. They said it on the way to 50 and they said it on the way down to 15. Uh, what's even more surprising is that when I look back to the 1980s looking into when the Hunts brothers were trying to squeeze silver, uh, same thing actually. Inflation is high, deficits are large. Guys, this is uh, you know, basically your debasement trade. And they said that all the way up to 50 and all the way down to $7. So this stuff, guys, this just happens over and over again. All this is is speculation, momentum, leverage, so forth. Highly, highly unstable. And so when you have a very, very unstable thing, you just have need a little push to overwhelm, to tip over the apple cart. And that's what Kevin W did. You just hawk comes in, uh, dollar strengthens, not hugely, but you know, marketly, but then that that seems to unravel everything. You got, uh, when volatility picks up, somebody sells, markets over lever, other people have to sell, and then you have these people who are, you know, managed according to volatility, volatility spikes, they have to sell. You got CTAs looking at momentum, they have to sell, everyone sells, and then it becomes really, really disorderly, which is exactly what happened. Down, uh, 30% a day, that that is one for the history books. It's, it's really, really shocking to me how badly this this played out. Um, but also how much, uh, leverage there was in their system.

Now, as an aside though, I would also note that, uh, having silver, some people were saying like hundreds of dollars, that's that's never going to happen. Uh, it's not going to happen. Uh, because silver is is different from, you know, this other crap people speculating, right? Silver is actually an industrial metal. Uh, stuff like meme coins, dog coins, stuff like that, you can go and push that as high as you want. Nobody cares. But if you, but silver is something that has to do with, you know, industrial policy, national security, stuff like that. So the government is not going to let speculators squeeze it to to really hide because it actually impacts a lot of important interest groups. And so in the 1980s, you have all these people who basically gotten together and to rig the game. So that's over, imploded. Uh, huge margin hikes, of course, uh, also letting only letting people sell, not buy, and so forth. So, um, I mean, if you want to push something higher, gold in my view is something that could go higher. Uh, these industrial models, you're fighting political economy. Um, but gold, of course, also huge, huge dip, 10% down. Now, I'm not as negative about gold. I think gold actually, I think we could still have higher highs this year. It seems like there's a lot of things going on. Similar dynamics again, not as levered, and also a much stronger demand base. You actually have, for example, central banks or other people who are, you know, a little bit more conservative in their views buying gold. Now, you will not have central banks buy silver. That that's just not not what they buy. Um, so that, I, I think that, uh, my best guess for silver is that we kind of try to push up, maybe I don't try to touch 100 or something like that, probably sales, and then it'd be the end, uh, until again, looking at the silver graph, uh, a few decades. Uh, gold though, I, I'm much more positive about, not not as worried about that. So, one thing to note is that that's really, really in Gat's favor is that we do have real geopolitical risk heating up right now. So, uh, a carrier, carriers have, a carrier has entered the Middle East last week, and it does seem like they're going to try to do something over there. And so that that's going to be, uh, now, this is probably not going to be Venezuela. Again, president has been very calculated in his use of military force. By the way, this is not at all mega. Um, but he, you know, this, these calculations are are difficult to make. You have huge amounts of uncertainty in geopolitics. A lot of things that, you know, are difficult to predict, and we don't know that. We don't know. So, it could be very, very bad, and that could help gold. Well, in any case, totally historic week. Um, all right. I'll talk to you guys next week.
