### 杰克逊霍尔会议：鲍威尔讲话与市场解读

**Tracy Alloway:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是特蕾西·阿洛威。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the All Thoughts Podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我是乔·维森塔尔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 乔，我们仍在**杰克逊霍尔**（Jackson Hole: 每年由堪萨斯城联邦储备银行主办的全球央行年会）会议现场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, we are still at Jackson Hole.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。等到这期节目播出时，整个会议的尘埃应该已经落定。我们已经听到了美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔的讲话，对吗？而今天下午，在我们录制节目时，市场正在飙升。似乎每个人都将此解读为相当**鸽派**（Dovish: 指货币政策倾向于通过降低利率来刺激经济增长，而非抑制通胀）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. By the time this episode comes out, the dust will have settled over the entire event and we will have gotten well, we already had the speech from Fed Chair Jerome Pal, right? And this afternoon, as we're recording, we're seeing markets surging. Um, everyone, it seems, has interpreted this as pretty dovish.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，没错。彭博社的安·黄发表了一篇有趣的文章，认为鲍威尔的讲话可能没有人们想象的那么鸽派。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's right. Ann Wong at Bloomberg had an interesting piece. Well, maybe it wasn't as dovish as people think, but</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但在当前背景下，它确实显得鸽派。你知道，最近与奥斯坦·古尔斯比的交谈中，他开始更加关注通胀数据，并对此表示担忧。在与堪萨斯城联储主席杰弗里·施密特最近的一期节目中，他也提到情况可能仍然有些过热。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it felt dovish in the context of, you know, a recent chat with Austin Goulby recent he was concerned about he's starting to look at that inflation data a little bit more. Felt dobish in the context of our recent episode with Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmidt. He too was talking about how, you know, things are maybe still looking a little warm on</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 你可能会谈论加息。如果你看看**泰勒规则**（Taylor Rule: 一种货币政策规则，根据通胀和产出缺口建议央行调整利率），你可能会认为利率应该更高一些。无论如何，我认为我们应该继续采访尽可能多的美联储主席。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you could be talking about hikes. If you look at the Taylor rule, you know, you could argue maybe rates should be a little higher. Anyway, I think we should continue on our our survey of as many Fed presidents as we can.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的。嗯，我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾。说到这里，欢迎播客的老朋友，里士满联储主席汤姆·巴尔金。欢迎回来，很高兴见到您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Uh well, we do have the perfect guest. On that note, a friend of the pod, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin. Welcome back. It's good to see you.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 是的，也很高兴见到你们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, good to see you guys, too.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 非常感谢您抽出时间，从您的徒步旅行和会议日程中。所以，我们很感激。我们先从一个显而易见的问题开始吧，我想您本周早些时候提到，目前就业风险和通胀风险之间的平衡非常不明确。鲍威尔似乎更倾向于劳动力市场，对吗？他似乎选择了优先考虑这一点。您认为这是正确的做法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks so much for doing this, taking time out of your, you know, hiking and conferencing schedule. So, we appreciate it. Why don't we just start with the obvious question which is I I guess you talked earlier this week that the balance between employment risks and inflation risks is really unclear at the moment. Pal seemed to heir on the side of the labor market, right? He kind of chose to prioritize that. Do you think that's the right move?</p>
</details>

### 就业市场与通胀风险的复杂平衡

**Tom Barkin:** 嗯，正如你所说，我一直在说我对一切都很困惑。我对劳动力市场和通胀方面都感到困惑。我认为很多人对如何权衡这些风险有不同的看法。有趣的是，一年半以来，我们一直听到企业说他们没有招聘。我们在数据中也看到了他们没有招聘。但他们也没有裁员。当我们看到就业数据持续每月增加13万或12万时，这看起来很奇怪，但这是个好消息。我的意思是，有很多工作岗位并没有什么不好。所以我们上个月看到了一份不同的就业报告，其中包含了一项就业修正，现在它似乎在说：“嘿，我们每月只增加3.5万个工作岗位。”考虑到我在市场中听到的情况，这实际上对我来说更有直观意义。如果你没有招聘，那么新的招聘从何而来？顺便再说一句，我们将在9月收到一份**季度就业和工资普查**（QCW: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages: 美国劳工统计局发布的一项全面就业数据）的修正，这可能会再次下调这些数字。所以，如果你面对的是一个每月13万个工作岗位的市场，那与你面对一个每月3.5万甚至可能是零增长的市场，信心水平是截然不同的。我认为这就是担忧的来源。让你不至于过度担忧的是失业率，它仍然保持在4.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, as you said, I've been saying I'm confused about everything. I'm confused about the labor market and the and the inflation side. And I think there's lots of people who come up with different views of how to weigh the risks. Here's the interesting thing. We've been hearing from uh businesses for a year and a half that they haven't been hiring. We've been seeing in the number that they haven't been hiring. They also haven't been laying people off. And when we get into the jobs numbers that kept coming in at 130,000 a month or 120,000 a month, that seemed strange, but it was good news. I mean, there's nothing wrong with a lot of jobs. And so what we saw last month was a different jobs report with a jobs revision that now sort of says, "Hey, we're growing at 35,000 jobs a month." That actually makes a little more intuitive sense to me uh given what I'm hearing in the marketplace. If you're not hiring, then where are the new hires coming from? And by the way, we'll get a revision a QCW in September that probably will take those numbers down again. And so if you're dealing with a 130,000 job market, that's a very different level of confidence than if you're dealing with a 35,000 or even maybe even a zero uh job growth market. And I think that's where the concern comes from. What holds you back from being overly concerned is the unemployment rate, which still is at 4.2%.</p>
</details>

这是一个非常好的失业率，无论在任何时候、任何周期都是如此。所以，你知道，你对就业增长有多幸运？你对失业率有多大信心？两者之间的差距显然是由我们不再像过去那样有净移民流入造成的。你可以称之为每年200万人。我这一代，婴儿潮一代，正在逐渐退出劳动力市场。我没有变老，也没有退出劳动力市场，但我这一代人正在这样做。在过去三年中，每年可能有130万65岁及以上的人退出劳动力市场。然后，这种临时保护身份（Temporary Protected Status）的事情又让一些人退出劳动力市场。所以，我们有可能看到零就业增长，这会使失业率保持稳定。但是，你知道，对此感到紧张并没有错。我认为你也必须对通胀方面感到紧张。在所有关税讨论之前，我们还没有达到2%的水平。所有关税问题正在显现。它对通胀的影响并没有一些人想象的那么大，但人们仍在转嫁成本。你可能看到了沃尔玛昨天的财报，他们提到了这一点，或者家得宝，你知道，人们都在谈论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Perfectly really good unemployment rate, you know, at any time in any cycle. And so you know, how much how lucky do you feel D? Did you feel in the jobs growth? How much do you feel in the unemployment rate? The gap between the two obviously is driven by we're not having net migration, you know, into the country the way that we used to. You could call that 2 million uh a year. My generation, the baby boomer is baby boomers are aging out of the workforce. I'm not aging nor am I out of the workforce, but my generation is. And that's maybe a million3 people 65 and older increase out of the workforce over the last 3 years per year. And then, you know, this temporary protected status thing takes some more people out of the workforce. And so it's possible that, you know, we're seeing zero job growth and that's going to keep the unemployment rate steady. But, you know, there's nothing wrong with being nervous about that. I think you also have to be nervous on the inflation side. And we weren't at 2% before all the tariff talk. All the tariff stuff's coming in. It's not hitting inflation nearly as much as some people thought, but people are still passing it on. You would have seen Walmart's earnings report yesterday where they talked about it or Home Depot or, you know, people are talking about</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。沃尔玛基本上说它要来了，它要来了。现在，它不一定像人们想象的那么严重，如果你愿意，我们可以讨论这个问题，但它确实要来了。所以，我喜欢说货币政策在四分之三的时间里都非常容易。你知道，当通胀高企而失业率低时，就加息。当情况相反时，就降息。而且，你知道，如果通胀低而失业率也低，你就可以在杰克逊霍尔多待几天。但如果你在通胀方面和就业方面都有风险，那事情就变得困难了。请告诉我们您对鲍威尔讲话的解读，因为实际上似乎并没有就其“鸽派”程度达成共识。市场飙升了，但当您听到或读到它时，我不知道您是什么时候看到的，或者您是否提前得到了它，我只是好奇，您和我们一样同时读到它时，您是如何解读的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Walmart basically said it's coming. It's coming. Now, it doesn't have to be as severe as, you know, people like to think, and we can talk about that if you want, but it's coming. So, I like to say monetary policy is really easy threequarters of the time. You know, when uh inflation's high and unemployment's low, raise rates. And when you have the opposite situation, lower rates. And you know, if inflation's low and unemployment's low, you can spend a few more days at Jackson Hole. But if you're going to have risk on the inflation side and risk on the employment side, that's when it gets hard. Talk to us about your interpretation of Powell's speech because it does seem like actually there is not consensus and how quote dovish it was the market surged but when you heard it or when you read it I don't know when you saw it whenever you when it maybe do you get it in advance I'm just curv so you were you read it at the same time uh as we did like what was your read on it</p>

### 鲍威尔讲话：中性解读与市场反应

**Tom Barkin:** 所以，我认为你们都非常有才华，比我更擅长解读演讲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think you guys are all incredibly talented and much more talented than I am at interpreting speeches</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 呃，来吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so uh come on</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 他非常圆滑，信不信由你，我上周也发表了一次演讲，一位美联储评论员仔细分析了我演讲的最后一段，并将其与我之前的最后一段进行了比较，然后说：“看，巴尔金在这些方面有所改变。”我当时想，嗯，那做得真好。我，你知道，我甚至没有那么深思熟虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">he's being very diplomatic believe it or Not I actually gave a speech last week and one of the Fed commentators went through my last paragraph and compared it to my last paragraph before and said see Barkin has changed in these ways. I'm like huh that was really well done. I I you know I was even sophisticated.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 所以评论员说对了，在某种程度上，您自己也曾思考过这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the commentator was correct in a way that you actually yourself thought about respect.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 所以，当你们阅读这些演讲时，我的意思是，逗号很重要，句子很重要。这确实是我们的职责。就其价值而言，那是我们的同事在处理逗号。但是，让我们听听您的团队怎么说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um so when you guys read these speeches I mean the commas matter the sentences matter. That's really our call. For what it's worth, that's our colleagues who are doing the commas. But let's give us let's hear your team.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我相信杰伊和他的团队都非常老练。所以我也相信他们也在考虑这些。所以我不是说人们不会犯错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I and I'm sure Jay's very sophisticated in his team. So I'm sure they're also thinking about that. So I'm not saying people get no accidents.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 但当我读到它并听到它时，我实际上是第一次现场听到它，所以我没有在它发布前阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when I read it and when I heard I actually heard it live for the first time, so I didn't read it before it came out.</p>
</details>

在我看来，那是一次非常中立的演讲。如果你问我市场会怎么做，我想我会认为他们会将其解读为适度鸽派。我读到的感觉比我听到的更鸽派。但我知道什么呢？我的意思是，我只是像其他人一样在听演讲。我的意思是，这有点引出了一个问题，但鲍威尔本可以很容易地说，你知道，我们依赖数据，我们将等待下一个**消费者物价指数**（CPI: Consumer Price Index: 衡量消费者购买商品和服务价格变化的指标）数据，下一个非农就业数据。相反，他选择真正强调**双重使命**（Dual Mandate: 美联储的两大政策目标，即最大化就业和稳定物价）中的劳动力方面。为什么？这是为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seemed like a perfectly downthe-middle speech to me. If you would asked me what the markets would have done, I guess I would have imagined that they'd read it as modestly dovish. It seemed like I read it as more dovish than I heard it. But what do I know? I mean, I'm just uh listening to the speech like everybody else. Well, I mean, this kind of begs the question, but Pal could easily have just said, you know, we're data dependent and we're going to wait for the next CPI number, the next payrolls number. Instead, he chose to really emphasize the labor side of the dual mandate. Why? Why is that?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我的意思是，你得问他，当他来节目时。我知道你会有很多问题要问他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you'd have to ask, you know, him when he comes on the show. I know you'll have a lot of questions for him on that.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 告诉他他应该来节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell him he should come on the show.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 我会说杰克逊霍尔每年都有一个奇怪之处，那就是我们会议之间间隔最长的一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say one thing that's odd about Jackson Hole every year is it's the period where we have the longest break between me and</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 对，对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 而这一次，我们不仅会议之间间隔很长，而且，你知道，在他新闻发布会后的一两天，我们收到了就业报告的大幅修正。所以，我不知道，也许你可以想象，从新闻发布会到这里，他试图进行市场调整。我不知道。我的意思是，他知道自己在做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this time, not only do we have a long break between meetings, but you know, the day after or two days after his press conference, we got these big revisions on the job report. So, I don't know, maybe you could imagine there was a trying to mark to market the from the press conference to hear. I don't know. I mean, it's uh he knows what he does.</p>
</details>

### 经济前景：迷雾渐散与消费者信心回升

**Tracy Alloway:** 在我们与杰夫·施密特的谈话中提到了一个观点，我很好奇这与您从企业那里听到的情况如何契合。你知道，几周前我们在阿拉斯加与玛丽·戴利交谈时，她说，你知道，这些修正对我来说是有道理的，其实有点像您说的，因为这与我一直听到的轶事评论相符，而且直观上也是如此，在解放日之后，有很多焦虑和不确定性。是的，招聘放缓是有道理的。然而，堪萨斯联储主席施密特说的是：“是的，这很符合，但是不确定性现在正在缓解。关税的不确定性远不如四月中旬那么大，尽管几乎每天都有新的头条新闻。不确定性远没有那么多，也许那是一年中的周期低点，也就是四月、五月、六月、七月这段时间。”根据您所看到的情况，这听起来合理吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Something that came up in our conversation with Jeff Schmid was this idea that, and I'm curious how this sort of jibes with um what you've been hearing from businesses. You know, when we talked to Mary Daly in Alaska a few weeks ago, she said, you know, the revisions made sense to me actually kind of like what you're saying because actually this is fitting with the anecdotal commentary that I've been hearing that and intuitively right post liberation day, lots of anxiety, uncertainty. Yeah, it makes sense. There'd be a hiring slowdown. However, something that uh Casey Fed President Schmid said was, "Yes, it fits, but well, the uncertainty is easing now. tariffs are not as uncertain as they were in the middle of April by any stretch even though there's new headlines almost every day. There's nowhere near as much uncertainty and then maybe that was the cycle low for the year that sort of April, May, June, July period. Does that seem plausible to you based on what you're seeing out there?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 是的。所以，我一直将其描述为在迷雾中驾驶。嗯，你知道，我一直在说，当你在迷雾中驾驶时，很难踩油门，因为你不知道下一个弯道后面是什么。你也不想踩刹车，因为你不知道后面的人会不会撞上你。所以，你靠边停车，打开危险警示灯。这是我几个月来一直在使用的一个货币类比。但是，但是，我上个月一直在说的是，我认为迷雾正在消散。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, I've been describing that as driving in the fog. Um, and you know, I've been saying that when you're driving in the fog, it's hard to put your foot on the bra on the gas because you don't know what's around the next curve. And you don't want to put your foot on the brakes either because you don't know what someone behind you is going to run into you. So, you pull over and put on the hazards. That's a a money analogy I've been using for a few months. But, but what I've been saying, you know, the last uh month is I think the fog is lifting.</p>
</details>

我确实认为我们已经了解了移民方面的情况，以及放松管制方面的情况。不同行业有不同的观点。我们有一项税收法案，所以你知道它看起来是怎样的。人们至少知道关税的界限是什么。现在，我不认为它们会一劳永逸地设定，我们将永远知道规则。我认为它将是一个会反复出现的工具。但我认为人们或多或少知道那是什么。所以当我与企业交谈时，感觉情况正在转变，你知道，我现在要“折磨”这个类比了，因为他们认为道路崎岖不平，对吧？所以我仍然听到很多不招聘、不裁员的声音。我会，你知道，对我的成本保持一点谨慎。我会通过自然减员而不是裁员来做。我仍然听到这种说法。我听到了一些关于加大投资的故事，特别是受到一些折旧政策的支持。你知道，我一直在等待这项税收政策通过，所以我有，但我也不会说不是大规模的，你知道，适度的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I do think we've got, you know, what's happening on the immigration side, you know, what's happening on the deregulation side. different sectors in different you have different points of view on that. We have a tax bill, so you know what that looks like. And people have a, you know, at least what the boundaries look like on tariffs. Now, I don't think they're ever going to be once set, done, and we'll know the rules for forever. I think it's a tool that is going to surface again and again. But I think people sort of know what that is. And so when I'm talking to businesses, it feels like it's shifting now that, you know, I'm going to now torture the analogy because they think the road's bumpy, right? And so I still hear a lot of not hiring, not firing. I'm gonna, you know, be a little cautious with my cost. I'm going to do it through attrition, not through layoffs. I still hear that. I've heard a few stories of leaning into investing, particularly supported by some of the depreciation stuff. You know, I've been waiting for this tax thing to pass, so I have certainly, but I wouldn't say not at scale, you know, modest amounts of it.</p>
</details>

唯一可能看到情绪变化的地方是在消费者方面。我从我交谈过的零售商和制造商那里听到了从六月底到七月消费者支出有所回升。如果你看信用卡数据，你会看到七月份有大幅增长，并在八月的前两周持续。这很合理，因为一群消费者，顺便说一句，他们仍然有工作，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one place where you might be seeing the sentiment change is on the consumer side. And I've been hearing from the retailers I'm talking to and from the manufacturers I've talked to of a lift in consumer spending starting in, you know, end of June into July. If you look at the credit card data, you'll see a big increase in July, which has continued the first two weeks of August. It would make sense that a bunch of consumers who by the way still have jobs,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 随着通胀下降，实际工资仍在上涨，市场显然也很健康。无论是资产估值还是房地产或股市，都非常健康，他们可能在四月和五月的所有新闻背景下退缩了，现在他们可能又回来了。所以这是我开始看到动向的一个地方。我非常关注。你知道，我们下周会得到**个人消费支出**（PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures: 衡量美国国内个人消费支出的指标，是美联储偏好的通胀指标）数据。非常关注我们看到的情况。或者不是。你可以想象，你知道，消费者在担忧时会暂时退缩，你可以在消费者信心数据中看到，他们担心通胀会达到天文数字，然后突然之间，你知道，人们会失业，他们会遇到问题，现在他们没有看到这些。这有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">real wages are still up as inflation comes down and the markets are obviously healthy. Both asset valuations and houses or stock market all very healthy that that they might have taken a step back in the context of all the news in April and May and maybe now they're coming back in. So that that's the one place I'm starting to see movement. I'm I'm very attentive. You know, we'll get the PCE next week. Very attentive to what we're seeing. or not. You could imagine, you know, a temporary air pocket as consumers sort of pulled back worried and you see this in the consumer sentiment data that inflation was going to hit huge numbers and all of a sudden, you know, people were going to be unemployed and they were going to have issues and now they're not seeing it. It's possible.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 您认为我们现在经济可能正在重新加速吗？因为您看零售销售数据，它们非常强劲，正如您指出的。您看**花旗经济意外指数**（Citi Economic Surprise Index: 衡量经济数据表现与市场预期之间差异的指标），它一直在上升。一些地区调查也开始有所改善。您看到了这种重新加速的势头吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think that we're maybe getting a bit of a reaceleration in the economy at this point? Because you look at retail sales, they were very strong as you point out. You look at the city economic surprise index that's been ticking up. Some of the regional surveys are starting to improve a little bit. Do you see that reaceleration impetus?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 你知道，这有可能。就像我说的，我看到了消费者方面的活力。我们会看看它能持续多久。你知道，我认为当你达到那个点时，你就可以称之为重新加速。我绝对没有和那些谈论业绩爆炸式增长的企业交谈，我也没有听到那种加速。所以，我没有听到泡沫化的迹象，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's possible. Like I said, I sort of see the energy on the consumer side. We'll see how long it lasts. You know, I think you can call a reaceleration when you get there. I definitely am not talking to businesses who are talking about blowing out earnings, and I I don't I don't hear one of those kind of accelerations. So, I don't hear frothiness</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 呃，还没有，但我确实听到了消费者支出方面一些非常积极的信号，我很高兴听到这些。如果通胀仍然偏高，而且可能仍然存在通胀上行风险，为什么除了关税之外，还有更多因素在起作用呢？也许消费者实力很强，即使有来自关税的收入，赤字仍然很大。

<p class="english-text">uh yet, but I am hearing some very positive vibes on the consumer spending side, which I'm pleased to hear. If inflation is warm and maybe if there's upside risk still to inflation, why could there be more to it than just yeah tariffs are maybe but like could there be something more going on and perhaps that consumer strength pretty large deficit still even with the revenue that's coming in from tariffs</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 也许有人喜欢花钱，我不知道您怎么看通胀的故事，有多少是关税造成的，有多少是其他因素造成的？

### 通胀的粘性与关税影响

**Tom Barkin:** 嗯，所以我只是认为将通胀降回2%需要很长时间，如果你回顾**沃尔克时代**（Volcker Years: 指保罗·沃尔克担任美联储主席期间，通过大幅提高利率来对抗高通胀的时期）。当然，他对经济采取的措施比我们激进得多。当然，他面临的通胀更加根深蒂固，也没有通胀目标，但他大幅提高了利率。通胀大幅下降，但没有达到2%。它是4%。

<p class="english-text">well so I just think it takes a long time to get inflation back to 2% if you go back and look at the Vulkar years. And of course, he did stuff to the economy that was much more aggressive than what we did. And he of course he had inflation that was much more ingrained and didn't have an inflation target, but he took rates up a lot. Inflation came down a lot, but it didn't get to 2%. It was four.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 而且，你知道，它从4%缓慢下降到3.5%，再到3%，然后到2.5%，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, it sort of eaked its way down from four to three and a half to three to two and a half and then</p>

<p class="english-text">throughout the 80s and 90s.</p>

**Tom Barkin:** 完全正确。持续了20年，直到它达到2%左右，并开始稳定在2%左右。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. For 20 years until it sort of hit two and sort of started sticking around two.</p>
</details>

所以我给你们这个只是为了提供一个视角。而且，你知道，再次从我的经验来看，我告诉你们为什么会发生这种情况，那就是人们不会立即回到旧的数字。你需要在工资和价格方面进行一定程度的追赶。那些没有提高价格的人。我认为人们的预期很大程度上是由实际通胀触发的。所以，我以前的工作，我们每年都必须提高价格，我们对此有所考虑，很多时候我们是根据去年的通胀来提高价格的。所以，它就是有一定的粘性。所以我们看到的通胀数据非常令人鼓舞。它们从峰值的7%下降到2%多一点。现在可能又会上升到3%。所以，我认为这是一部分原因。实际情况就是它有粘性，需要一段时间。然后第二部分原因是，我确实认为存在关税担忧，人们正在转嫁成本，甚至那些没有成本的人也在以此为借口转嫁成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I give you that just for perspective. And you know, again, from my experience, I'll tell you why that happens, which is people don't just immediately go back to the old number. You've got some amount of catch-up to do wages and prices. People who didn't raise it. People's expectations, I think, are are very significantly triggered by actual inflation. And so, my old job, we had to raise prices every year, and we sort of thought about it, and a lot of times we raise price based on last year's inflation. And so, it just there's some stickiness to it. And so what we've seen is very encouraging on the inflation numbers. They've gone from, you know, seven at their peak down to, you know, somewhere in the high twos. Maybe it'll tick up to the three now. And so I think that's one piece of it. Actual just take it's sticky. It takes a while. And then the second piece of it is I do think you've got this tariff concern in there and that people are passing on costs and then people who don't even have the costs are using this as a a cover to pass on cost.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 那么，如果存在所有这些因素等等，为什么还有关于降息的讨论呢？或者说，如果存在关于降息的讨论，人们应该多认真地对待2%的承诺？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just real quickly then if there's all these factors etc. Why is there conversation about cutting rates? Or if there is conversation about cutting rates, how seriously should the should people be t take the 2% commitment?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 嗯，所以现在正在进行校准。所以你看到失业率很低，但可能呈上升趋势。你看到通胀一直在下降，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so there's calibration going on. So you've got unemployment that's low, but maybe trending up. You've got inflation that's been coming down</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 而且可能有所回升，但可能是一次性原因，而且你还有，好吧，一个**中性利率**（Neutral Rate: 既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的理论利率水平），根据所有说法，它低于我们目前的水平，但关于它是只低一点还是显著低很多，存在很多争论。所以，我认为这三件事是联系在一起的。人们只是问，在这种情况下，你是否需要重新校准到一个不同的数字，或者，你知道，我们目前的位置是否良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and maybe ticked up, but maybe for one-time reasons, and you've got, okay, a a neutral rate that is by all accounts lower than where we are, but lots of debate about is it just a little bit lower or is it significantly lower? And so I think those three things go together. And people just ask it do you recalibrate to a different number in the context of this or you know are we are we well positioned where we are.</p>

### 后疫情时代通胀下降的原因

**Tracy Alloway:** 这次讨论让我想起了：您认为后疫情时代通胀下降的原因是什么？是那种**“完美去通胀”**（Immaculate Disinflation: 指在不引发经济衰退或就业大幅增加的情况下，通胀率下降的现象）的解释，即供应链压力自行消散，还是美联储的行动实际上起到了“大锤”效应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This discussion actually reminds me what's your story for why inflation did come down in the post-pandemic period. Is it the sort of immaculate disinflation explanation where the supply chain pressures just started dissipating or did the the Fed's actions actually have you know a kind of sledgehammer effect here?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 我认为这是“以上所有”的综合。我的意思是，如果美联储在人们期望我们采取行动时没有行动，那么我认为这会以一种不太有益的方式瓦解预期。另一方面，你不能忽视，很多导致价格上涨的供应限制，比如大宗商品价格、港口船只积压、汽车芯片短缺、人们不上班等等，这些情况也得到了改善。我们还在大约两年内迎来了非常大的移民数量。这意味着，你知道，供应侧，工作岗位得到了更快的填补。它，你知道，肯定缓解了很多方面的压力。所以，供应有所帮助。希望美联储也尽了自己的职责，这些因素的结合使通胀下降了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's an all of the above. I mean, if the Fed doesn't act when people expect us to act, then I think that sort of unwinds expectations in a way that's not very helpful. On the other hand, you can't ignore that a lot of the supply constraints that were driving prices up, commodity prices, ships backed up in harbors, chips not in cars, people not at work, those things also ameliorated. We also had a really big immigration uh number for about two years. That meant, you know, the supply side, the jobs got filled a lot faster. it, you know, definitely released the pressure on a lot of things. So, supply helped. Hopefully, the Fed did its part and the combination of those things brought it down.</p>

### 北卡罗来纳州的经济转型与关税影响

**Tracy Alloway:** 当我们在阿拉斯加的时候，我们了解到每年在您的辖区，也就是北卡罗来纳州，都会有一个大型家具博览会。另外，北卡罗来纳州，我想如果人们想到那些因贸易而受损的地区，或者受到自由贸易严重冲击的地区，我不确定这是否属实，但肯定有这种看法。实际上，它就是您的辖区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we were in Alaska, we learned that there is a major furniture expo every year in your district in uh in North Carolina. Also, North Carolina is like I think if people think of like regions that have lost from trade or regions that got hit really hard by free trade, I'm not even sure if it's true, but certainly that is the perception. It's actually it's your district.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，这是我们和汤姆一起旅行，去他的一些地方与当地企业交谈时学到的一件事。人们普遍认为北卡罗来纳州的制造业已经被掏空了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this is one thing we learned by traveling with Tom and going on some of his trips to talk to local businesses. There is a sense that manufacturing in North Carolina has been hollowed out</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 绝对有非常强烈的这种感觉。但北卡罗来纳州也有一些城市是全国最具活力的城市之一，特别是在过去几十年里。但我现在只是好奇，在您的辖区，关税情况如何？您看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there. Absolutely is a very strong sense. But there's also cities in North Carolina that are some of the most dynamic in the entire country, especially over the last couple of decades. But I'm just curious right now like tariffs in your district, what are you seeing?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 所以，嗯，毫无疑问，历史上纺织业和家具业受到了非常严重的打击。然而，如果你看看卡罗来纳州，并回顾过去25年，你会发现也有很多外国制造商在那里建立了生产基地。我想到的是南卡罗来纳州的格林维尔和斯帕坦堡，我上周就在那里，那里有宝马和大型汽车制造商，以及他们的整个供应链都来到了这个城镇。你知道，我们现在听到的是，这在不同行业之间差异很大，而且在同一行业中，你的位置也大相径庭。所以，有很多在南卡罗来纳州和北卡罗来纳州生产的人，但他们从国外采购，他们非常担心成本。想想那些大型汽车制造商。也有很多人在北卡罗来纳州生产，他们是100%美国制造，他们认为这是世界上最棒的事情，因为他们的行业会得到保护，或者那些在另一边一直提供低成本的人会得到。所以这非常非常取决于你所处的位置。嗯，说到可能受益的特定行业，仍然有很多关税头条新闻不断涌现，但其中一个引起我注意的是特朗普说他将启动一项家具关税调查，旨在对进入美国的家具进口征收关税，特别是为了帮助北卡罗来纳州。当您看到这样的头条新闻时，您的第一反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, no question historically the textile industries, the furniture industries got hit very hard. If you look at the Carolinas though and you took the last 25 years, you'd say there's also been a lot of foreignbased manufacturers that have put manufacturing sites. I'm thinking of Greenville, South Carolina, Spartanberg, where I was uh you last week, where you've got BMW and big auto manufacturers, you know, and their whole supply chains coming into town. You know, what we hear right now is it's very different by sector you're in. Uh and it's very different by your position in that sector. So, there are a lot of people who manufacture in south in South and North Carolina, but they source abroad and they're very worried about their cost. Think of the big auto manufacturers. There's a lot of people who manufacture in North Carolina and they're 100% Americanmade and they think this is the greatest thing in the world because they'll get protection for their sectors or the people on the other side who've been you know putting low cost they're going to get. So it's very very dependent on where you sit. Well, speaking of, you know, specific sectors potentially benefiting, there are loads of tariff headlines still coming in, but one of them that caught my eye was Trump saying that he was going to start a furniture tariff investigation with a view to setting tariffs on furniture imports into the US specifically to help North Carolina. What's your immediate reaction when you see a headline like that?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 嗯，我们已经看到了很多关于关税的头条新闻。所以，我首先不会做的是，我尽量不过多地关注头条新闻。我们会看到哪些行业、哪些产品、以多长时间征收关税，这也是我与许多制造商交流时他们所做的。我相信在北卡罗来纳州生产家具的人会非常支持。实际上并没有那么多。很多工作岗位已经流失了。而且我认为如果人们开始考虑将工作带回来，你一遍又一遍听到的是劳动力的可用性和劳动力成本。你知道，我认为最有可能回来的工作是那些最不依赖劳动力，或者拥有最高技能劳动力，或者拥有高薪劳动力的工作。而这些工作很多都流向了劳动力成本非常低的地方。我不知道需要多高的关税才能将这些工作带回来。但那将是一个相当大的数字。另一件很少被谈论但我觉得很有趣的事情是，我去了希科里，那是一个工厂小镇。我在那里和很多家具制造商交谈，他们正在寻找工人。这是在疫情期间，他们当时正处于一个非常强劲的需求周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we've been seeing a lot of headlines, you know, on the tariffs thing. So I I first thing I don't do is I try not to surf headlines too much. We'll see what tariffs get applied on what industries, with what duration, on what products, and that's what a lot of the manufacturers I talk to also do. I'm sure the people who manufacture furniture in North Carolina would be uh very supportive. There aren't actually all that many. A lot of jobs have been lost. And I think if people start to consider bringing jobs back, the thing you hear about, you know, over and over and over again is just availability of workforce and the cost of workforce. You know, the jobs that I think are most likely to come back are ones that are the least dependent on workforce or have the highest skilled workforce or have high paid, you know, workforce. And a lot of these jobs have gone to places with very lowcost workforces. And I don't know the level of tariff that one would need to get to to, you know, bring those jobs back. But it's a pretty significant uh number. The other thing that's really not talked about much that I just think is interesting, I was in Hickory, which is a factory town. I talked to a lot of furniture manufacturers there and they're looking for workers. This is during the co and they were, you know, having a very strong uh demand cycle.</p>
</details>

但我去了一所社区大学。我与那里的许多工人交谈。我说：“嗯，你们正在接受培训，准备进入家具行业吗？”他们中的几个人告诉我，你知道，我爸爸以前在那里工作，后来被解雇了，所以我们不去那里。你知道，人们认为人们正在等待回到工作岗位，工作稳定性也很重要。所以，当我们把工作带回国内时，这会很棒，我希望我们能做到，确保它们是稳定的工作，是能够持续一代人的工作，我认为这对于吸引工人进入这些工作岗位非常重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I I went to a community college. I talked to a bunch of workers there. And I said, "Well, you guys training to get in the furniture industry." And several of them told me, you know, my dad was in there and got laid off and so we're not going there. you know, the thought that people are waiting to go back into the job stability matters a lot too. And so as we bring jobs back in the country, which would be great and I hope we do, making sure they're stable jobs and they're jobs that are going to be around for a generation is very important, I think, in terms of getting workers into the jobs. We are recording this the day that uh Chairman Powell gave his final speech as Fed chair at Jackson Hall. It was a policy speech and he did not talk about</p>

### 美联储独立性与长期通胀目标

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们录制这期节目的当天，鲍威尔主席在杰克逊霍尔发表了他作为美联储主席的最后一次演讲。这是一次政策演讲，他没有谈论美联储的独立性，以及来自白宫等对美联储独立性的攻击，或者美联储一直面临的政治压力。当您考虑通胀时，也许不是短期通胀，也许不是最新的**生产者物价指数**（PPI: Producer Price Index: 衡量生产者在生产过程中所获得的价格变化的指标）读数或其他什么，而是当您考虑长期通胀时，比如美联储维持2%通胀目标的能力，您是否会想到美国政治体系是否有“勇气”来维护美联储作为一个独立的、自主的经济力量？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fed independence and the attacks on Fed independence that are coming from the White House and so forth or the pro the political pressure that the Fed has been coming under. when you think about inflation, maybe not in the short term, maybe not, you know, the latest PPI reading or whatever, but when you think about like the long-term like the ability of the Fed to maintain that 2% inflation, do you think about like well will the US political system have the sort of stomach to preserve a Fed as a independent agentic force in the economy?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 嗯，所以我们所有人都在过去五年里重新学习了一些我们不知道需要重新学习的东西，那就是我们多么讨厌通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so we've all relearned something in the last 5 years that we didn't know we needed to relearn, which was how much we hate inflation.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 而且通胀，你知道，它让人感觉不公平。你得到了加薪，然后，你知道，钱花在了别处。它制造了不确定性。坦率地说，它只是让人筋疲力尽。处理那些试图提高你价格的人，或者四处寻找更优惠价格，或者与供应商打交道，这些都让人筋疲力尽。所以，如果说过去五年里美国人民在某件事上达成了一致，那就是我们多么讨厌通胀。而且，你知道，在许多国家，关于如何最好地控制通胀，并由一个独立的中央银行来完成，已经做了大量工作，这是这个问题的答案。研究结果非常有力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And inflation, you know, it feels unfair. You get a raise and then, you know, the money gets spent somewhere else. It's creates uncertainty. And frankly, it's just exhausting. It's exhausting to deal with people who are trying to raise your prices or to shop around for better prices or deal with, you know, uh, vendors. And so, if there's one thing I think the American people have aligned on over the last 5 years, it's just how much we hate inflation. And you know there's been a lot of work done uh in a lot of countries in terms of what's the best way to get inflation under control in an independent central bank is the answer to that question. The research is is very powerful.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 但是您是否担心，在中期内，允许美联储这样的实体存在并独立于选举周期运作的政治体系正面临压力？

### 通胀“剧本”与消费者抵抗力

**Joe Weisenthal:** 只是关于人们讨厌通胀这一点，嗯，我认为这是一个非常突出的观点。您一直非常直言不讳地谈论公司已经学会了“通胀剧本”这个想法，对吗？比如他们在上一轮高通胀期间测试了价格弹性，而且，你知道，也许这次有更多的冲动来提高价格，以抵消更高的投入成本或更高的关税成本。您仍然倾向于通胀冲动这一边吗？您认为那种残留的经验仍然重要吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just on the people hate inflation point um which I think is a very salient idea. You've been very vocal on the idea of like companies having learned the inflation playbook, right? like they tested um price elasticity during the last round of high inflation and you know maybe maybe there's more of an impulse this time around to raise prices to offset either higher input costs or higher tariff costs. Are you still sort of on the inflationary impulse side? Do you think that residual experience still matters?</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 我绝对认为残留的经验很重要。当我与公司谈论他们受到的关税影响时，你听到的第一件事就是：“我要把它转嫁给我的客户。”但我也认为这种残留的经验在客户方面也很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I definitely think the residual experience matters. When I talk to companies about the tariffs that that hit them, the first thing you hear is I'm going to pass it on to my customers. But I also think this residual experience matters on the customer side.</p>
</details>

你知道，我想我只是提醒大家，现在不是2022年。在2022年，许多供应成本冲击了许多公司，这些公司将成本转嫁了出去。而那些收到这些成本的人，你和我，我们因为新冠疫情已经一年半没有花钱了。我们收到了刺激性付款。我们的资产相当泡沫化，估值很高。我们已经准备好进行“报复性消费”，我们也确实消费了。那是2022年。我们现在不在2022年。顺便说一句，当时我们也有宽松的货币政策。我们现在是2025年，我们有**限制性货币政策**（Restrictive Monetary Policy: 指央行通过提高利率等手段来减缓经济增长和抑制通胀的政策），此外，消费者已经在向下交易。所以，我早些时候说过，他们有钱，但并不急于花钱，你听到的是从正常价格零售商转向价值零售商，从牛肉转向鸡肉，从度假转向居家。这就是你听到的，自有品牌也在增长。所以，我认为这些消费者不会像以前那样接受那些价格上涨，这有点像**米尔顿·弗里德曼**（Milton Friedman: 诺贝尔经济学奖得主，货币主义学派的代表人物）的观点，如果系统中没有更多的钱，你怎么会有通胀呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I guess I just remind everybody that this isn't 2022. In 2022, a bunch of supply costs hit a bunch of companies that passed it on. And the people who received them, you and I, we hadn't spent money for a year and a half uh with COVID. We'd gotten stimulus payments. Our assets were quite frothy and highly valued. We were ready for revenge spending and we spent. And that's 2022. We're not in 2022. when by the way we also had accommodated monetary policy. We're in 2025 where we have restrictive monetary policy and in addition you have consumers who are already trading down and so I've said earlier they've got money but they're not dying to spend it and what you hear is normal price retailer to value retailer beef to chicken um vacation to station that's that's what you're hearing and people and private label is growing and so I think those customers are not going to accept those price increases the same way they have and it's sort of Milton Friedmany a little bit if there's not more money in the system how are you going to get inflation</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 有人会争辩说系统中有一些钱，你会得到一些通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">argue there's some money in the system and you'll get some inflation.</p>

### 限制性货币政策与经济活力

**Tracy Alloway:** 您刚才提到了限制性，这也是鲍威尔今天演讲中提到的。他说，你知道，利率仍然具有限制性。我想他说的是“尽管只是适度限制”。但当我看到股票处于历史高位，信用利差处于，你知道，基本上30年低点时，金融状况，如果你专门看市场，情况似乎并没有那么限制性。美联储是如何得出关于基准利率关系或其性质的结论的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned restrictiveness just then and this is something that pal also said in the speech today. He said, you know, rates are still restrictive. I think he said albeit modestly so. But when I look at stocks at all-time highs and credit spreads at, you know, basically 30-year lows, financial conditions, things don't seem all that restrictive if you look specifically at the market. H how is the Fed sort of coming to the conclusion about the relation of benchmark rates here or the character of</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 正如你从**经济预测摘要**（SCP: Summary of Economic Projections: 美联储官员对经济增长、通胀、失业率和利率的季度预测）中可以看出，不同的人有不同的模型。嗯，我们在里士满使用的模型，你知道，与利率对经济的影响有很大关系。所以，你知道，你可以看到利率是多少，你可以滞后一年再看，看看影响是什么。我喜欢看的一个指标是**名义消费**（Nominal Consumption: 未经通胀调整的消费支出总额）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As you can tell from the SCP, different people have different models. Um the model that we use in Richmond, you know, has a lot to do with the impact of rates on the economy. And so, you know, you can see what rates are and you can lag it and look a year later and see what the impact is. One thing I like to look at is nominal consumption.</p>
</details>

嗯，疫情期间名义消费相当高。我们提高了利率，它下降了，但仍处于一个不错的水平。它一直保持在5.5%左右，直到最近几个月，但在过去一两个月里，它似乎已经脱离了那个水平。我们会看看最新的数据是什么，但名义消费是一个很好的观察方式，因为它只是说明利率对经济中人们的行为有什么影响。我确实同意还有许多其他因素会影响经济的活力。如果市场泡沫化，这是我们无法控制的，那也是其中的一部分。但在我们控制的部分，我认为你可以通过它的作用看到它。我想我只有一个问题要问您。我只是觉得，也许因为您经常与企业交谈，您可能对此有新的见解。您最近在谈话中是否经常听到关于电价的问题？因为我觉得它们开始出现在新闻中，电网的压力等等，无论出于什么原因。您对此听到了很多吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, nominal consumption was quite elevated during the pandemic. We raised rates and it came down still at a decent level. It's been it's been sort of 5 a half% until the last couple months, but it sort of seems to have come off that um in the last month or two. We'll see what the more recent data is, but that nominal consumption is a great way to look at it because it just says what's happening in rates to what people are doing in the economy. I do agree there are lots of other factors that affect dynamism in the economy. And if the market's frothy, a thing we don't control, that's also part of it. But in the part we control, I think you can see it by its works. I think I just have uh one more question for you. And I just feel like maybe because you talk to businesses so much, maybe you're have some fresh insight on this. Do you hear much about electricity prices in your conversations these days? Because I feel like they're starting to be in the news and the strain on the grid and what for whatever reason. How's that that you hearing much about that?</p>

**Tom Barkin:** 对电力供应有很多担忧。

<p class="english-text">You know, are we going to have enough electricity to power all the AI and all the data centers are going up.</p>

<p class="english-text">You know, there are there are states, you know, Virginia is one where data centers are quite right. And so, you do hear a little bit of public concern about what's this all going to mean? Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tom Barkin:** 但只是提醒一下，电价往往会显著滞后。它们必须经过费率审批程序。每个州都不同。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But just a reminder that electricity prices tend to lag significantly. They got to go through rate processes. Every state is different.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，我不确定这是否正在影响普通消费者。我确实听到很多，我称之为地方基础设施融资成本正在转嫁给消费者，消费者在这种背景下正在做出权衡。所以，你知道，一个月前我在马里兰州的一个小镇，那里的水费大幅上涨，很多人都在讨论不支付水费，因为所以你确实更广泛地听到了这个问题，但我不会说价格已经上涨了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so, you know, I'm not sure that's hitting the consumer public. I I do hear lots of I'll just call it local infrastructure funding costs being passed on to consumers and consumers making trade-offs in that context. So, you know, there was a big water increase in a town I was in in Maryland a month ago and a lot of conversations about people not paying their water bill because so you do hear it more broadly, but I wouldn't say that the price has yet hit.</p>

### 杰克逊霍尔会议的“氛围”与经济复杂性

<p class="english-text">Yeah, this is my eighth one. Two of them were virtual. They're not nearly as good when they're virtual.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我敢打赌没有鱼。

**Tom Barkin:** 那是一幅美丽的画面。嗯，总的来说，我认为氛围基本相同。我的意思是，我真的很喜欢它们，因为它们会稍微更新一下参与者，你知道，所以每次都有新的学者，我没有见过的新领导人，所以这对我来说很有趣，我能理解这一点，但我不太确定氛围是否会有很大变化。能被邀请到这样的地方是一种真正的荣幸，我很享受，我不会花很多时间去思考具体的氛围。好的，汤姆·巴尔金，非常感谢您再次来到《Odd Lots》，我们非常感激。

<p class="english-text">It's a nice It's a nice picture. Uh I'd say in general the vibe is is uh pretty much the same. um every time I mean uh I really like them because there's a they they turn over the population a little you know and so there are new academics every time new academics I haven't met new leaders I haven't met so that's kind of fun for me and I get that but I I I'm not sure the vibe changes all that much it's a it's a real privilege to be invited to a place like this and I enjoy it and I I don't spend a lot of time thinking about uh the vibes exactly all right Tom Barkin thank you so much for coming back on a thoughts really appreciate it</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 乔，你知道，我有一些北卡罗来纳州的家具。质量真的很好。也许

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, you know, I have some furniture from North Carolina. It's really good quality. Maybe</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是北卡罗来纳州制造的，而不仅仅是通过北卡罗来纳州的港口或展会进口的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">made in North Carolina, not just imported through the portion or the shows of North Carolina.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，实际上是北卡罗来纳州制造的。我知道这一点是因为它是老式的。所以那可能是在，是的，家具业在那里规模更大一些的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, actually made in North Carolina. And I know that because it's vintage. So it was probably back when Yeah. the furniture industry was a little bit bigger there.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我确实认为，北卡罗来纳州，我的意思是，这是一个长期存在的争论，2000年代和2010年代一些最大的繁荣城市，比如达勒姆和所有那些地方等等。你知道，它仍然像回溯一样，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think like did North Carolina I mean as a long-standing debate some of the biggest boom cities of the 2000s and 2010s were like you know Durham and all those places etc. You know it's still like going back</p>
</details>

一个巨大的繁荣城市。那里所有的银行业务等等，如果你想想过去25年。这是我们认为最“空心化”的地区等等。它也是整个地区增长最快的地区之一，这是否复杂？即使是过去也是复杂的。事后诸葛亮也并非总是明智的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a huge boom city. All the banking stuff there like you think about the last 25 years. This is the area that we think is like most quote hollowed out etc. It's also like one of the fastest growing areas of the whole is it complic even even the past is complicated. Hindsight is not 2020.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。而且我认为复杂性，以及不确定性，是这次会议的两个主要流行词。显然，我们一遍又一遍地听到，在授权的就业方面和价格方面都存在风险，中央银行家基本上必须在两者之间做出艰难的选择，决定他们将专注于哪一个。我确实认为汤姆提到他将鲍威尔的演讲解读为比市场认为的更中性，这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I think complication is sort of complication and uncertainty are the big buzzwords of this conference. Clearly like we hear it over and over again that there are risks on both the employment side of the mandate and the price side of the mandate and central bankers basically have to make like a tough choice over which one they're going to concentrate on. I did think it was interesting that Tom mentioned that he read Pal's speech as more down the middle than perhaps the market did.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 不，我也觉得那很有趣。我喜欢那个“迷雾”的比喻，你实际上也不想打破太多的迷雾，因为你后面的车可能无法及时反应。我觉得那真的很好。我还喜欢关于四分之三的时间里，作为中央银行家真的很容易，因为你要么加息，要么降息，要么去怀俄明州徒步旅行。但第四次，比如**滞胀**（Stagflation: 指经济停滞、失业率高企与通货膨胀并存的现象）的恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I thought that was interesting, too. I like the um the fog analogy that you actually don't want to break too much of the fog fog either because the car behind you might not react to time. Thought that was really good. I also like the part about how threequarters of the time being a central banker is really easy because either you hike or you cut or you go on a hike in Wyoming. But the but the fourth time like the fear is stagflation.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 对。就像那第四次。所以他说，这就是那第四次。现在，无论它是否持续，但我们所有这些对话中谈论的基本内容，我们谈论的是这种日益增长的对滞胀的焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Like that's just that's what that that's what that fourth. So he was like this is that fourth time. Now how persistent whether it be whether but the basic like what we're talking about in all these conversations what we're talking about is this building anxiety about stagflation.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 它是滞胀与难以预测的实现时间相结合。对。那似乎也是一个复杂因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's stagflation combined with really difficult to predict timelines for exactly when it materializes. Right. Like that also seems to be a complicating factor.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。那我们就到此为止吧？就到这里吧。
