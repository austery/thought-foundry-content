### 引言介绍

**主持人**: Brendan Sweeney 是加拿大高级制造网络 Trillium Network 的总经理。你好，Brendan。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: Brendan Sweeney is the managing director of the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing. How are you doing, Brendan?
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 我很好，谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: I'm doing great.
</details>

**主持人**: 那么，请给我们介绍一下当前的情况。目前加拿大有多少家企业已经参与到国防制造领域？又有多少企业可以在接到要求后迅速转型？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: All right, so give us the lay of the land here. How many companies across Canada are already involved in the defence manufacturing sector? And how many could transition if the call is made out.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 根据我们正在建立的能力目录，目前加拿大有超过 1200 家制造商参与其中。其中大约一半、640 家位于安大略省。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Based on a directory, a capability directory that we're building. We have right now more than 1200 manufacturers across Canada, and I think about 640 of them are located in Ontario. And I mean, it's a really exciting when we put this all together and we can just kind of map it out provincially, map it out nationally. There's a lot of great insights that we're gleaning around who these companies are, what they do and what they could do. Once we learn a bit more about the defence industrial strategy and what's going to be asked of.
</details>

**主持人**: 在谈到安大略省时，我想很多人会想到多伦多市中心。但我们也注意到像我们北面的 York Region 地区也有不少相关企业，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: Them when we talk about the Ontario, I think a lot of people were here in Toronto Midtown, but we're just like York Region just north of us has a pretty good concentration of a lot of these companies as well. Correct?
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 是的。仅 York Region 地区，我们发现了超过 80 家已经确认是国防供应商的企业。还有另外的约五十五到六十家我们认为有很高的转型潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Yeah. We found in York Region alone more than 80 companies that that kind of validated defence sector suppliers, plus another 55 or 60 that we kind of ranked as a high potential to pivot or transition. There's also York Region, absolutely shout out York region.
</details>

**主持人**: 那么在多伦多市内、皮尔地区、伦敦、滑铁卢和尤其是渥太华，这些地方是否有大量国防供应商？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: But in the city of Toronto proper, in Peel Region, in London, in Waterloo and especially in Ottawa, there are substantial concentrations of defence sector suppliers.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 是的，在多伦多市区、皮尔地区、伦敦、滑铁卢和渥太华，都有很多国防供应商。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Yeah.
</details>

### 安大略省的国防制造产品

**主持人**: 那么在安大略省，目前有哪些国防相关的产品或零部件正在制造？我们当然也重视这些“零件”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: Give us a sense here. What defence products or parts here in Ontario? Of course we like our parts. What are we.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 当前最大的组成部分是航空航天。其中很多企业属于三线或四线的供应商，我们在起落架及其组件方面有显著优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: So the largest and probably most substantial component or segment is aerospace. And in many cases it is third or fourth tier aerospace suppliers. And we have some particular strengths in landing gear and landing gear components.
</details>

**主持人**: 在安省南部靠近伦敦的区域还有地面系统相关的生产，特别是为 General Dynamics Land Systems Canada 提供零部件。而在渥太华、滑铁卢及 York Region 的部分地区，有国防电子和卫星制造的能力。比如 Brampton 的 MDA 公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: In southern Ontario, if you go closer to the London area, you have land systems and you have a network of suppliers to General Dynamics Land Systems Canada. And then in Ottawa, in Waterloo and in parts of York Region, you have some really, really interesting capabilities related to defence sector electronics and satellites. And then of course Brampton, Ontario, MDA, which is manufacturing satellites and robotics for space applications, both defence and civilian or civilian and defence, however you want to look at it.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 没错，这些地方确实有非常重要的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Yeah.
</details>

### 技能人才缺口与行业潜力

**主持人**: 现在看起来，企业本身并不短缺。但当我们谈到国防制造时，人们常常会提到技能人才的缺口问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: All right. So when we look at that landscape, it doesn't seem like a shortage when we look at companies. But when we talk about defence, one of the things that we've had conversations about is in the gap in skilled trades. So I want to have an understanding if more Canadian companies do transition to making more defence products, are there enough skilled or highly educated technical workers to fill those roles?
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 我们确实有能力培养这些人才。如果要扩展国防制造能力，我们应该重点关注两个领域：制造和焊接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: There might be. We certainly have the capability to train those people. There are probably two places where we'd really want to think long and hard about investing in. If we want to expand our defence capabilities, a lot of these companies that are involved in the defence sector in Ontario make things out of metal, right? That means a lot of machining and welding. Those are two very important skilled trades.
</details>

### 自动车厂与国防制造的关系

**主持人**: 我们来聊聊汽车工厂。我知道这正是你的研究领域之一。过去，像坦克这样的军备生产常由汽车工厂改装备工。比如二战期间可以很快转型，那么今天是否还存在这种可能？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: All right. Let's talk auto plants. I'm going to do a little bit of a history lesson here. I know this is your background here as well. They used to play a key role in defence production because you could retool say to build tanks. For example, if you go back to a World War II, is it still true today? Can we do that? Can we pivot as quickly to, you know, move over from auto manufacturing to something like a tank?
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 可能不行了。转型可能是一个漫长的过程，甚至不需要进行彻底的转型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Maybe. Probably not. This is probably a longer process of transition, and it might not even need to be transition. It might be two things happening at once.
</details>

**主持人**: 现在是支持汽车工业的同时，也要扶持现有的国防制造企业。两者可以并行发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: We're going to support the automotive industry, and we're going to sustain and grow the automotive industry. And then we're going to support incumbent defence sector manufacturers, and we're going to grow that to.
</details>

**Brendan Sweeney**: 两者之间的联系更多体现在供应链的中下游层级，而非大型制造商。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: There is some relationship between the automotive industry and the defence sector, but it tends to be at lower tiers in the supply chain. So it's not necessarily the Magnas of the world or the Multimatic of the world that are really clamouring to get into the defence sector.
</details>

### 国防工业战略与政策影响

**主持人**: 如今，加拿大制造商还在等待一份非常重要的政府文件发布——也就是国防工业战略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: Okay, as of the taping of this show right now, Canadian manufacturers are still waiting for the release of a fairly important document to kind of give them.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 我们需要一个长期的计划和战略。这份政府文件将向我们指明资源投入的方向，包括哪些领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Why is that important strategy document for companies who are already involved in the sector, but those who might be looking for an opportunity here? I think at the foundation of it, it's going to signal where we're going to be directing resources.
</details>

### 政府关注的问题与中小企业的重要性

**主持人**: 你和国防部进行过关于加拿大国防制造基础的讨论。能帮我们理解一下政府想知道哪些问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: I was going to say the a lot of the manufacturers have been waiting. I know the federal government had promised around December of last year that they would get this policy, but they're still waiting. You've had consultations with the Department of National Defence about Canada's defence manufacturing base. Help us understand what questions does the government have about the sector's capabilities and potential?
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 政府希望以非常细致的方式了解我们能做些什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: I think exactly the work that we're doing, they want to understand at a really, really minute level of detail exactly what we can do.
</details>

**主持人**: Brendan，非常感谢你抽出宝贵时间接受采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Host**: Speaking of useful, this was very useful. Brendan, thank you very much. Really appreciate your time on the program.
</details>
**Brendan Sweeney**: 谢谢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Brendan Sweeney**: Thank you.
