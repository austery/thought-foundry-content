title: 谷歌TPU挑战英伟达霸权？市场深度解析谷歌市值冲刺4万亿与英伟达股价震荡
---

### 谷歌市值冲向4万亿，英伟达应声下跌

早上好，各位。欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是11月25日，星期二。过去24小时，全球两家主要公司——谷歌和英伟达——发生了一些疯狂的事情。谷歌即将以4万亿美元的估值开盘。考虑到不久前，大约在四五月份，这只股票还停留在140美元，现在看到这一幕真是相当不可思议。目前，该股在盘前交易中达到331美元。两周前它突破了300美元，一周前超过了310美元，昨天突破了318美元。昨夜价格为320美元，然后一项小交易的宣布导致这只股票飙升。我们将在开盘时看看人们是会利用这个机会卖出，还是会买入这股炒作热潮。而这股热潮非常真实，这也是我认为谷歌在盘前交易中获得如此高估值的原因。谷歌股价为331.15美元，上涨了3.95%。

<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Tuesday, November 25th. The last 24 hours have been kind of crazy in regards to what has happened with two major companies on the planet. I'm sure you people know those two companies, Google and Nvidia. Google is going to open up at a $4 trillion valuation. It's quite incredible to see this happening given the stock was stuck at 140 not long ago around about April May. Stocks at 331 in the pre-market. It was, you know, kind of breaking 300 two weeks ago, getting above 310 one week ago. Yesterday breaking 318. Overnight it was at 320 and then there was a little deal announced that caused this bad boy to run up. And we're going to see when the market opens if people take advantage of that and they sell or if they buy into the hype. And the hype is very real which is why I think Google is getting the validation that it's getting right here in the premarket. 331.15 on Google. That's up 3.95%.</p>
</details>

与此同时，英伟达股价下跌了5%。我认为这是对昨天宣布的交易的剧烈过度反应。对于那些还没听说的人，我们会讨论一下发生了什么。我认为，英伟达之所以被抛售，是基于新闻标题的膝跳反射式反应。尽管如此，昨天的交易确实带来了一些潜在影响。由于这些影响，市场显然在说，我们要把一个打压下去，把另一个抬高上来。如果它们的市值发生翻转，那将是相当疯狂的。我的意思是，英伟达目前的交易市值是4.4万亿，而谷歌将以4万亿开盘。这并非不可能。上周，英伟达在几个小时内市值就下跌了4000亿美元。所以，看到英伟达回落到4万亿，而谷歌或许到不了4.4万亿但能维持在4万亿，这并不难想象。但无论如何，今天开盘时，我们将会发现市场到底有多在乎英伟达的芯片主导地位受到威胁。

<p class="english-text">At the same time, Nvidia is down 5%. I think this is a dramatic overreaction to the deal that was announced yesterday. And for those that haven't heard about it, we will talk and discuss what's going on. And I think it's a knee-jerk reaction based on the headline for why Nvidia is getting sold off. But nonetheless, there are some potential implications of the deal from yesterday. And as a result of those implications, the market's obviously saying we're going to take one down and the other up. It would be kind of crazy if they flipped market caps. I mean, Nvidia right now is trading at 4.4. Google's going to open at four. It's not that. I mean, Nvidia went $400 billion down last week in a couple hours. So, it would not be that crazy to see Nvidia kind of come back to 4 trillion and Google maybe not get to 4.4, but stay at 4 trillion. I mean, that would be not hard to see. But, nonetheless, today when the market opens, we're going to find out how much the market actually cares about Nvidia's chip dominance being threatened.</p>

### 宏观经济数据：就业降温与通胀信号

在我们深入探讨谷歌和英伟达这个大新闻之前，让我们先看看数据，因为今天早上我们收到了大量的市场数据。首先，我们来看看**ADP私营部门就业数据**（ADP Private Payrolls: 由自动数据处理公司发布的衡量非农私营部门就业变化的指标）。在截至11月8日的四周内，私营部门就业人数平均每周减少13,500人。上次我们从ADP获得这个数据时，是负2500人。所以，每周裁员人数大约增加了500%。这显然只会增加降息的可能性，尽管这对实体经济来说不是好事，因为人们失业并不是一件好事。目前降息的概率现在是84.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we get into all that, obviously Google Nvidia is the big story. Let's get into data because we got a ton of market data this morning. First let's start off with the ADP private payrolls and then we'll get into everything else we got going on. Private payrolls fell by an average of 13,500 per week in the four weeks ending November 8th. The last time we got this data from ADP, it was negative 2500. So that's about a 500% increase in the amount of jobs that were being laid off per week. This is for private payrolls. And obviously that is only boosting the probabilities of a rate cut even though that's not good for the actual economy because people losing their job is not a good thing. The rate cut probabilities now are 84.7%.</p>
</details>

要记住，上周这个数字还是30%。事实上，上周30%的概率让我们很有可能开始认为不会降息。市场也因此转向。昨天，几位与纽约联储主席约翰·威廉姆斯同样有影响力的联储主席站出来主张降息。然后，这个数字昨天立即飙升到大约75%。接着你又看到了这份就业数据。我无法想象美联储看到这些数据后会认为维持现有利率是合适的。他们不必降息100个基点，但降息25个基点也不是什么坏事。所以我认为这就是为什么我们看到降息概率走高的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Remember, this number was 30% last week. In fact, that number being 30% last week kind of made it very likely for us to start assuming that we're not going to get the rate cut. And that's kind of where the markets turned. Yesterday, you had a couple Fed presidents who were just as influential as Fed President John Williams of New York, come out and advocate for the rate cut. And then boom, the number immediately switched to about 75% yesterday. And then you get this job data. I can't imagine the Fed is looking at this thinking, yeah, it's fine to keep rates the way they are. They don't have to cut rates by 100 bips, but a 25 basis point cut would not be the worst thing. And so, that's why I think we're getting that probability to go higher.</p>
</details>

然后，我们还收到了**PPI数据**（Producer Price Index: 生产者价格指数，衡量国内生产者在生产过程中所需采购品的物价状况），这让情况变得复杂，但我仍然认为美联储最终会倾向于降息。生产者价格环比上涨0.3%，符合预期的0.3%。同比增长2.7%，也符合预期的2.7%。核心PPI环比上涨0.1%，而预期为0.3%。九月份的核心PPI同比上涨2.6%，预期为2.7%。所以我们仍然在核心PPI和整体生产者价格指数中看到通胀，只是没有华尔街一些人想象的那么糟糕。因此，你看到降息的概率在上升。我认为这些数据还不足以糟糕到让我们说因为通胀失控而不能降息，因为它并没有失控。它虽然存在，但相当温和。所以这让降息的故事变得复杂，但我认为它并没有完全摧毁降息的叙事，这就是为什么84.7%的概率仍然是真实的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you also had PPI data, which complicates the story, but I still think the Fed ends up leaning towards a rate cut. Uh, producer prices increased .3% month-over-month. The expectation was .3%. So, that came in line. 2.7% year-over-year came in line with 2.7%. Core PPI rose .1% month-over-month the estimate was .3%. And then core PPI rose in September's 2.6% estimate 2.7%. So we are still seeing inflation obviously in core PPI and the overall producer price index. It's just it's not necessarily as bad as maybe some of the street thought it was going to be. And as a result, you are seeing those rate cut probabilities go higher. I don't think this data is that horrible enough to be able to say we can't cut rates because inflation's just going crazy because it's not going crazy. I mean, it's up there, but it's rather tame. So, it complicates the story on the rate cut. I don't think it completely destroys the narrative, which is why that 84.7% probability is still real.</p>

### 谷歌与Meta的TPU交易：动摇英伟达霸权的导火索？

好了，让我们来谈谈谷歌和英伟达。到底发生了什么？谷歌股价上涨了4%，而英伟达下跌了4.7%。昨晚传出了这样一条头条新闻。首先回顾一下，谷歌昨天有哪些利好消息？它拿下了北约的云合同，其Gemini 3模型获得了普遍赞誉。而且，巴菲特的伯克希尔公司购买了价值50亿美元的谷歌股票。我认为，当巴菲特用50亿美元的投资为谷歌背书时，那就是一个追涨（FOMO）的信号。在过去几周里，谷歌有很多利好因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Googles and Nvidia, let's get into it. What is going on? Google is up 4%. Nvidia is down 4.7%. This headline came out last night. So, remember what did Google have going for it yesterday? It had the NATO cloud contract. Um, it had Gemini 3 getting universal praise. And you know, when Birkshire when when Buffett praised Google with a when he co-signed it with a $5 billion investment. I think that was the sign to FOMO in now. You had a lot of things going for Google over the past couple weeks.</p>
</details>

昨晚，据The Information报道，Meta正在考虑在其数据中心使用谷歌的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路芯片），这笔交易可能价值数十亿美元。Meta正在洽谈斥资数十亿美元购买谷歌的AI芯片，即张量处理单元（TPU）。这项协议将有助于确立TPU作为英伟达芯片替代品的地位。我们知道，Anthropic公司已经在使用一百万个TPU，而Gemini 3模型也是在这些TPU上进行内部训练的。对于需要计算能力的大型科技公司和初创公司来说，英伟达芯片是黄金标准。与Meta的交易将是谷歌的一大胜利，但这在很大程度上取决于这些张量芯片能否展示出足够强大的能效和计算能力，从而在长期内成为一个可行的选择。如果这笔交易发生，它将在2027年实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last night, and I mean this was a big one. Meta is considering Google TPUs for their data centers in a deal that could be worth billions as per the information. That was the headline last night. Meta is in talks to spend billions on Google's AI chips known as tensor processing units aka their TPUs. An agreement would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia chips. We know that Anthropic is already using TPUs, a million TPUs, and Gemini 3 was internally trained on those TPUs, which are the gold standard for big tech firms and startups that need computing power. A deal with Meta would mark a win for Google, but much depends on whether the tensor chips can demonstrate the power efficiency and computing muscle necessary to become a viable option in the long run. If this were to happen, it would happen in 2027.</p>

### 深度解析：为何英伟达的抛售是过度反应？

我认为人们在这里抛售英伟达有点愚蠢。我真的这么认为。有很多原因让我觉得这种反应有些荒谬，其中很多都与英伟达的业绩数字有关。不过，在我们为英伟达辩护之前，让我们先谈谈这对英伟达的看空理由。从观念上讲，这基本上是在论证，那些英伟达拥有70%毛利率并使其形成垄断的芯片，可能不再那么被需要了。我认为你只需要这个理由就足以让股价下跌。同样的情况也适用于AMD。AMD股价下跌的原因是，人们认为如果谷歌的CPU成为这些定制**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 专用集成电路，为特定用途而设计的芯片）芯片栈的核心部分，那么像MI450、GB200这类产品的需求可能就不会那么大了。这就是今天股价下跌所需要的全部理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think people selling off Nvidia here are I think it's kind of dumb. I really do. There's a lot of reasons I think this reaction is kind of ridiculous. Uh and a lot of it has to do with Nvidia's numbers. But nonetheless, let's just talk about the bare case of this for Nvidia before we get into kind of the defense of Nvidia right here. Um, perceptually this is basically making the argument that the chips that were needed that Nvidia has a 70% gross margin on and that essentially formed it as a monopoly might not be needed as much. And I think that's all you need. You don't really need much more other than that to get the stock to fall off. Same thing with AMD. The reason why AMD is down is because of this idea that the MI450, the GB200, these things might not be in as much demand if Google's CPUs become a core part of the stack when it comes to these custom async chips. And that's it. That's all you need for the stock to go down today.</p>
</details>

我认为此刻这种逻辑并不那么合理的原因有几点，也许我错了。第一，谷歌仍然购买价值数百亿美元的英伟达GPU，而TPU只处理特定的工作负载，并非全部，这意味着谷歌的AI模型仍然严重依赖英伟达的硬件进行运行和训练。第二，TPU的新闻并非新鲜事。这从2016年起就已为人所知。所以市场并非完全获得了全新的信息。他们知道谷歌在使用自家的内部芯片。亚马逊有Trainium，Meta和微软也有自己的想法。但这些**Hyperscalers**（超大规模数据中心运营商，指像谷歌、亚马逊、微软这样运营着庞大规模数据中心的公司）一直未能摆脱对英伟达的依赖并支付“英伟达税”，因为它们一直无法在有意义的层面上匹配英伟达芯片的架构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reasons why I don't think this is that logical in the moment, and maybe I'm wrong. Number one is Google still buys tens of billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs and TPUs handle specific workloads, not everything, which means Google's AI models still run and train heavily on Nvidia hardware. Number two, the TPU news is not new. This was known since 2016. So, it's not like the market completely has this brand new piece of information. It's like no, they knew that Google was using their own in-house chips. Amazon has tranium. Meta and Microsoft have their own ideas as well. They've never the hyperscaleros have never been able to get off of the Nvidia bandwagon and pay the NVIDIA tax and maybe that happens eventually, but it hasn't been able to happen for a while because they haven't been able to match the architecture of those chips in a meaningful way.</p>
</details>

现在，Meta考虑在2027年采用。这意味着在2026年，他们所有的芯片需求仍将流向AMD和英伟达，以及像博通等其他合作伙伴。这并不意味着如果他们打算在英伟达芯片上花费300亿美元，他们就会说：“嘿，谷歌，拿走我们的300亿。”我不认为会发生这种事。第三，即使谷歌减少了订单，这些GPU也会被立即买走。除非你相信英伟达8K文件中披露的关于库存上升和成品积压的说法，那意味着他们可能有需求问题。但如果你相信Jensen所说的，Blackwell已经售罄，并且他们正在以最快的速度生产和销售，那么无论亚马逊、甲骨文、特斯拉还是其他众多初创公司，如果谷歌减少订单，我想英伟达仍然能够把芯片卖出去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, Meta's considering this in 2027. That means in 2026 all their chip demand is going to go to AMD and Nvidia and a variety of other partners like Broadcom, etc. But it doesn't mean it's just going to if they're going to spend 30 billion on Nvidia chips, I don't think they're going to say, "Hey, Google, take our 30 billion." Like, I don't think that's happening. Number three, uh even if Google reduced orders, let's just make an argument that that Google's reducing orders, the GPUs would be instantly bought. Unless you believe the argument about rising inventories and fixed goods in Nvidia's um 8K that was disclosed, which shows that like their inventories are going up, which means they might have a demand problem. But if you think that's the case, Nvidia has plenty of demand. And whether it's Amazon, Oracle, Tesla, plenty of other startups, like if Google reduced their orders, I would imagine that Nvidia is still able to sell that. If you believe Jensen and what he says that Blackwell is sold out and we are making them as fast as we can sell them, then uh that would not necessarily be the number one thing that would cause an issue.</p>
</details>

我认为市场更广泛的担忧是，如果谷歌减少了在英伟达上的芯片支出，那么谷歌可能会让其他人也减少在英伟达上的芯片支出。这就是复合效应的开始，英伟达现在可能会失去多个客户。如果谷歌以某种方式说服了微软、Meta和所有其他大型云服务商开始购买他们的TPU而不是英伟达的GPU，这将是一个大问题。但我认为不能仅仅因为与Meta有了一笔交易就轻易地假设这一定会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the market is more broadly worried that if Google is taking away uh their chip spend on Nvidia, then Google is going to get other people to take away their chip spend on Nvidia. And that's where you sort of have this uh this compounding effect that Nvidia now is losing multiple customers. if Google somehow gets Microsoft and Meta and all these other big hyperscalers to start buying their TPUs for whatever reason over Nvidia GPUs, which is a big question. I don't think you can easily just assume like, yeah, that's definitely going to happen just because there's a deal with Meta.</p>
</details>

### 市场观点：半导体行业的周期性与未来格局

当然，有一个更广泛的论点，Chris昨天在Steve的直播中也提到了，这是一个非常公平的论点。Chris的观点是，归根结底，半导体是周期性的，英伟达是一个周期性业务，最终这个周期将导致那些支付“英伟达税”的人不再愿意支付。因此，这不仅会导致英伟达未来的衰退，也会导致其销售周期的衰退。我认为这是一个公平的观点，而且这不可避免地会发生。我们都不能否认，英伟达不可能每个季度都销售价值3000亿美元的芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I get the broader argument and and Chris made this argument yesterday on Steve stream, which is it's it's a very fair argument. Chris's argument is that at the end of the day, semiconductors are cyclical, and Nvidia is a cyclical business, and eventually that cycle is going to lead to the uh people that are paying the Nvidia tax not wanting to pay that Nvidia tax anymore. And as a result, it will lead to the inevitable decline not only of Nvidia in the future, but of their their sales cycle. I think that's a fair point, and inevitably that's going to happen. Like, we all can't deny. Inevitably, Nvidia is not going to be selling $300 billion worth of chips every quarter.</p>
</details>

但根据我从英伟达财报中消化的一切，根据我们从Jensen那里听到的一切，以及我们看到的未来至少四年到2030年的资本支出需求，这似乎不会在2026年或2027年发生。它就是看起来不会。构建数据中心的架构需求仍然巨大。昨天亚马逊宣布了650亿美元的数据中心支出，其中500亿在弗吉尼亚，150亿在印第安纳州北部，其中很多将填充的不是Trainium芯片或TPU，而是英伟达的GPU。随着我们看到其他超大规模数据中心运营商也参与进来，这种趋势只会越来越强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But given everything that I've digested from Nvidia's earnings, given everything that we've heard from Jensen, given the capex demand that we've seen going into the next at least four years going into 2030, that does not seem like it's happening in 2026 or 2027. like it it just doesn't it seems like the architecture for building I mean the fact that Amazon announced $65 billion worth of data center spend yesterday 50 billion in Virginia and 15 billion in uh northern Indiana a lot of those going to be filled not with tranium chips or TPUs but Nvidia GPUs and this is only increasing more and more as we see the other hyperscalers engage in this stuff.</p>
</details>

这是一个月前Jensen在一个播客上谈论谷歌TPU的片段。

> 主持人：鉴于谷歌TPU看似成功，您如何看待当今这个不断演变的格局？
> Jensen：首先，谷歌的优势在于远见。记住，他们在一切开始之前就开始了TPU1。这和一个初创公司没什么不同。你应该在市场成长之前创建一家初创公司。你不应该在市场规模达到万亿美元时才作为初创公司出现。所有风险投资家都知道这个谬论，即在一个大市场里，只要你能占据几个百分点的市场份额，你就能成为一家巨头公司。这实际上是根本错误的。你应该占据一个微小公司、一个微小行业的100%份额，就像英伟达所做的那样，对吧？就像TPU所做的那样。当时只有我们两家。但你最好希望那个行业变得非常大。你在创造一个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's Jensen a month ago on a podcast speaking about Google's TPUs.
>> given this seeming success of Google's TPUs, you know, how are you thinking about this evolving landscape today?
>> Yeah. First of all, the the advantage that that Google had is foresight. Remember, they started TPU1 before everything started. You know, this is no different than a startup. You're supposed to build a startup. You're supposed to create a startup before the market grows. You're not supposed to come up as a startup when the market's a trillion dollars large. You know the this fallacy and and all VCs know this this fallacy that a large market if you could just take a few percent market share you could be a giant company. That's actually fundamentally wrong. You're supposed to take 100% of a tiny company, a tiny industry, which is what Nvidia did did, right? Which is what TPUs did. There were only the two of us. But you better hope that that industry gets really big. You're creating an industry.</p>
</details>

这段剪辑中非常重要的一点是，Jensen在说，就数据中心和芯片建设而言，这个行业的整体复合年增长率是巨大的。再说一次，谷歌的业务不是卖芯片。谷歌的业务可能会变成销售这些TPU。这可能成为他们业务的一部分，也许这确实会从英伟达那里抢走一些市场份额。但这是否意味着英伟达需要回到100美元？我认为这利好谷歌，但并不利空英伟达。而市场现在的交易策略是做多谷歌，做空英伟达，我认为这不会是正确的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the part of that clip that's really important is that Jensen is saying the overall kagger for where this industry is going in terms of data center buildout and chip buildout is massive. And again, Google's business is not selling chips. Google's business could potentially become selling these TPUs. That could become a part of their business. And maybe that does take away some market share from Nvidia. Does that mean Nvidia needs to go back to $100? I see this as bullish Google, not bearish Nvidia. And the market right now is going long Google, short Nvidia, which I don't think is going to be the trade.</p>
</details>

### 嘉宾对谈：TPU是威胁还是机遇？

**Amit:** Jose，早上好。我们直接进入正题吧。在我们即将跌破170美元的时候，你是否在抛售你所有的英伟达股票？发生了什么？

**Jose:** 绝对没有。我的意思是，我认为谷歌和Meta的消息在表面上看起来很吓人。但我觉得每个季度，我们都会遇到某种针对AI市场的不同看空论调。我认为这只是看空论点存在，并且表面现象确实如此，所以它制造了这种看空情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Hey, what's going on, man? Good morning.
>> Good morning to you, dude. Let's get right into it. Are you selling all your Nvidia as we as we're about to drop below 170? What's going on?
>> That definitely not. I mean, I think obviously the optics looks scary with this Google and Meta news. Um, but I feel like every quarter, right, we kind of get some different type of bearish thesis for the AI market. I would just say it's just the bearish thesis is there and the optics are definitely there. Um so it kind of creates this bearish sentiment.</p>
</details>

**Jose:** 我们已经听到了很多数据。首先我们听到的是计算能力不足。Meta平台在他们的财报中直接提到，他们的核心产品和AI产品仍然处于计算能力匮乏的状态。记住这一点很重要，Meta有两个不同的业务部门使用计算能力。他们用它来做推荐系统、广告的AI解决方案以及核心业务，这是花费最多的地方。然后他们还有自己的AI实验室。所以第一个问题是，这些TPU属于哪个部分？是用于核心业务还是AI实验室？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing we hear is there's not enough compute. I mean meta platforms mentioned it directly on their earnings that they are still compute starved on their core products and their AI products and that's important to remember right Meta has two different businesses where they use form of compute they use it for their recommener system their AI solutions for their advertisement in their core business and that's where most of the money gets spent then they also have their own AI labs so the first question is where do these TPUs fall under is it going to go onto their core business or is it going to go into their AI labs.</p>
</details>

**Jose:** 其次，我们从Jensen那里听到了什么？Jensen几乎是说他们已经卖光了，他们有巨大的可见性。好吧，我是Meta，我从英伟达那里拿不到更多的芯片了。难道我应该坐下来等着英伟达制造更多的芯片吗？如果这对我的业务发展来说在物理上是不可能的，我就必须寻找其他玩家。这并不意味着我会买更少的英伟达芯片，我只是需要更多的计算能力。不幸的是，英伟达，或者AMD，可能无法提供给我。所以我需要在别处找到计算能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do we hear from Jensen? Jensen pretty much says that they're sold out. They have massive visibility. Okay, so I'm meta. I can't get any more chips from Nvidia. Am I just supposed to sit down and just wait for for Nvidia to make more chips? If that's not physically possible for my business to do well, I have to look for other players. It doesn't mean I'm going to buy less Nvidia chips. I just need more compute. And unfortunately, Nvidia, unfortunately, maybe AMD can't give it to me. So, I need to find that compute elsewhere.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我认为你很好地解释了行业的整体增长率以及需求的巨大程度。但更深层次的问题是，如果Meta在使用谷歌TPU的任何用例上都取得了成功，并且成本只是他们需要支付的“英伟达税”的十分之一，那么谷歌会不会说，哦，如果Meta能从中获益，也许微软、亚马逊也能……是否存在这样一种可能性，即这正是英伟达芯片垄断开始瓦解的开端，即使需求依然巨大？

**Jose:** 首先，TPU主要用于这些AI工作负载，对吧？所以它不会摧毁任何所需的云能力，因为那是GPU的强项，它们对很多事情都非常灵活。我们看到谷歌在哪里使用他们的TPU？用于他们的Gemini，用于他们所有的AI工作负载。但如果你去谷歌云，他们卖给其他玩家的是每个人都想在英伟达上开发的东西。所以，我不认为这会终结任何需求，因为整个开发者生态系统是建立在GPU上，而不是TPU上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I think you did a good job explaining the overall kager of the industry and how much demand is out there. I think the deeper question and I'm curious if you've developed any thoughts on this. If Meta is successful with Google's TPUs for whatever their use case is and it costs let's say onetenth of the Nvidia tax that they have to pay and then Google says oh if Meta is getting value from it maybe Microsoft is getting maybe Amazon like is there a world in which this is the beginning of Nvidia's chip monopoly beginning to fall even with all the demand that's out there
>> well I I mean, first the TPUs are mainly used for these AI workloads, right? So, it's not going to destroy any of the cloud capacity that is needed, right? Because that's the strength of GPUs. They're very flexible for a lot of things. Where do we see Google use their TPUs? It's used for their Gemini. It's used for their AI workloads overall. But if you're going to Google Cloud, what they sell to other players is what everybody wants to develop on Nvidia. So I would say I don't think it would end any of that depend because the overall developer ecosystem is on embedded on GPUs not TPUs.</p>

**Jose:** 另一件事是，如果我是微软，如果我是Meta，如果我是亚马逊，我会信任谷歌的TPU吗？他们是我的竞争对手。英伟达在这个竞赛中是一个中立的参与者。如果Gemini 4、5、6做得非常好，以至于谷歌说：“看，我不能再卖给你TPU了，我全都要留给自己。”你作为Meta，愿意承担这种风险吗？你可是谷歌在广告模型和AI领域的直接竞争对手。所以，除非谷歌改变其整体商业模式，成为一家芯片公司，否则我看不到这些玩家会转向他们。

<p class="english-text">Now the other thing that I would say is if I was Microsoft if I was Meta if I was Amazon would I want to trust NVIDI uh Google's TPUs? They are my competitors. Nvidia has is a neutral arm player in this race. What happens if Gemini 4, Gemini 5, Gemini 6 does so well that Google says, "Look, I can't sell you any more TPUs. I want them all to myself." Do you want to have that risk as Meta who is literally the direct competitor of Google with their advertisement models and with their AI players? So, I I don't unless Google changes its overall business model to become a chip company, I don't see these players going into them.</p>

### Meta的投资逻辑：在动荡中寻找价值

**Amit:** Chris Patel，75万美金在Meta上。兄弟，怎么回事？

**Chris:** 我认为人们真的不理解Meta从AI中获得的价值，以及这对Meta来说是多么具有颠覆性。Meta在财报后大幅下跌的一个主要原因是由于一项一次性的非现金费用。因为这个原因，出现了一个算法交易系统，人们看到盈利大幅下降就自动开始抛售，这导致了一连串的恐慌性抛售。但如果你看看Meta的基本面，什么都没有改变，它们是AI最大的受益者之一。很多其他AI领域的公司还在试图弄清楚如何将AI变现。Meta已经在将AI变现了。

<p class="english-text">>> Chris Patel 750 in meta. What is going on, brother?
>> I don't think people really understand the value that Meta actually gets from AI and how gamechanging it is for Meta. Okay, I think a couple of things just really really just to get it out the way. One of the main reasons why Meta took a giant dip post earnings was because of a one-time non-cash charge. because of that there's been like a cascade of panicking all the way down. But if you look at where Meta is fundamentally, nothing has changed for Meta, they're one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. So a lot of other companies right now that are in the AI space, they're still trying to figure out how to monetize AI. Meta is already monetizing AI.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 让我们谈谈重点，因为我不同意你的看法。我认为Meta下跌不是因为税费问题。那只是算法的膝跳反应，但股价一直低迷是因为财报电话会议。扎克伯格基本上是说：“相信我，如果我觉得我们花得太多了，我会缩减开支，但请相信我，我会解决这个问题。”你对华尔街不清楚扎克伯格将如何迎来他的“Gemini 3时刻”有何回应？是的，他们在广告上有投资回报，但显然华尔街并不在乎这个。

**Chris:** 不，不。问题在于我们恰好在所有AI股票都出现完美下跌风暴的时候受到了冲击。所以你看到Meta财报下跌，然后过去三周发生了什么？哦，AI是个泡沫。整个叙事被推高，因此人们都在抛售Meta。

<p class="english-text">>> Let's let's get into the juice of it because I do disagree with you. I don't think Metaphel is the tax charge. I think that was an algorithmic knee-jerk reaction, but it stayed down because of the call, which you and I talked about before. Zucks basically said, "Trust me, and if if I think we're spending too much, I'll dial it back, but trust me, I'm going to figure this out." What is what is your response to the street not effectively knowing how Zucks will have his Gemini 3 moment? And yes, they have an ROI on ads, but obviously the street doesn't care about that.
>> No, no. The the thing is we got hit by a perfect cascade of downward movement in all the AI names at the exact same time. So you had literally you had meta earnings things go down and then what happened for the last 3 weeks who's been up in the last two three weeks? Oh AI is a bubble. That entire narrative got pushed and because of that people were selling Meta off.</p>
</details>

**Chris:** 现在人们正在卸载谷歌的股票，然后说：“等等，Meta现在的估值是多少？”所以他们现在都在涌入Meta。Meta正在迎头赶上。所以我同意这一点，我同意Meta很便宜，这也是我买入Meta的原因，我对估值没有任何异议。我更广泛的问题是，如果华尔街因为它看不到**Capex**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）的投资回报而将其股价从750美元打压到585美元，你对此有何回应？仅仅是广告吗？因为我不知道这是否足够。

**Chris:** 这就是我的问题。如果看看Meta在广告上的复合年增长率，怎么会不够呢？

<p class="english-text">>> now what they're doing is they're unloading on Google and saying, "Wait a second, Meta's trading at what valuation right now?" So, they're all jumping into Meta right now. And so, Meta is catching a bit higher. So, I agree with that and I agree Meta is cheap and that's why I bought Meta and I like zero disagreement on the valuation. My broader question is if the street took it down from 750 to 585 because they don't see the ROI on capex. What is your response to that? Is it just advertising? Because I don't know if that's enough.
>> Here's my question to you. How is it not enough? If you look at the kagger of Meta on it advertising.</p>

### 开盘动态：市场如何消化重磅消息

好了，各位，上午9:30，股市现在开盘了。谷歌当日上涨2%，报325美元，市值为3.92万亿美元。博通上涨1.94%。AMD下跌6.2%。英伟达下跌4.5%，基本与盘前持平。到目前为止，在这个区间内没有太多的买家或卖家。你看到它基本保持稳定，我们将看看是否能出现逆转。

<p class="english-text">All right, folks. 9:30 a.m. The stock market is now open. All right, wake your asses up. Let's get into it. Google up 2% on the day at 325. 3.92 trillion. 3.92 trillion on Mr. Google. Broadcom is up 1.94%. AMD is down 6.2%. Nvidia down 4.5 basically where it was in the pre-market. So far not too many buyers or sellers in this range. You're kind of seeing it stay stabilized and we'll see if that can get a reversal.</p>
</details>

英伟达看起来想要跌破174美元。让我们看看它是否会。它确实做到了，触及了173美元。我们将看看它是否会进一步下跌。谷歌呢？谷歌，哇，谷歌放弃了所有涨幅。我的天哪，从332美元跌到321美元。好吧，所以人们肯定在谷歌上获利了结。我的意思是，这很难否认。也许这里会出现逆转，人们会在321美元买入，但它当天仍然是上涨的，只是失去了很多动力。市值回落到3.87万亿美元。

<p class="english-text">Nvidia looks like she wants to break 174. Let's see if she does. She does indeed. 173 she hits. We'll see if that further goes down. Where is Google? Google. Wow. Google giving up everything. My goodness. 332 to 321. Okay, so people are definitely taking their profits on Google. I mean, it's hard to deny. Maybe you get a reversal right here and people buy the dip at 321, but uh still green on the day. Lost a lot of its steam. Back down to a $3.87 trillion company.</p>
</details>

苹果呢？我们是否在苹果上创下历史新高？好吧，我猜他们卖掉了谷歌和英伟达，转向了苹果。看看那个，苹果股价279美元。苹果市值4.12万亿美元。再次成为一家4万亿美元的公司。AMD下跌了8%。

<p class="english-text">Apple, are we moving alltime high on Apple? Okay, so they I guess they sold Google and Nvidia. They went to Apple. Look at that. 279 on Apple. Apple 4.12 trillion. Once again, a $4 trillion company. AMD is down 8%.</p>

对于那些错过了英伟达新闻的人来说，今天真正的消息是，据称谷歌正在洽谈向Meta出售其TPU，即张量处理单元，这是英伟达GPU的替代品，本质上是一种定制的ASIC芯片。华尔街的担忧是，这是对英伟达的一个警告信号，表明其芯片垄断已经结束。他们将无法维持现有的需求水平，谷歌将侵占他们的垄断地位。他们的毛利率将无法维持。英伟达现在是171美元。如果超大规模数据中心运营商开始从英伟达转向多元化，因为坦白说，他们都想摆脱对英伟达的依赖，那么他们可能会开始支持TPU。他们支付的费用将低于购买GPU的费用。如果有什么不同的话，那就是英伟达必须给他们更好的交易来留住他们，这意味着他们的利润率必须压缩。而英伟达习惯的增长将开始断崖式下跌。这就是英伟达今天受到如此重创的30秒看空理由。当日下跌6%。

<p class="english-text">For those that missed the Nvidia news, the real news here today is that Google is in talks supposedly to sell their TPUs, their tensor processing units, which are an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, uh essentially a custom ASIC to Meta. And the fear is from the street that this is a warning signal for Nvidia that their chip monopoly is over. That they're not going to be able to sustain the type of demand that they have that Google's going to encroach on their monopoly. Their gross margins are not going to be able to be sustained. Nvidia now 171. And uh if the hyperscalers start diversifying from Nvidia, because all of them, if we're going to be honest, want to diversify from Nvidia, then maybe they start propping up the TPUs. They start paying less than what they're paying for the GPUs. If anything, Nvidia has to give them better deals to get them to stay in their ecosystem, which means their margins have to compress. And the growth that Nvidia has been used to starts to fall off a cliff. That is the bare case in 30 seconds for why Nvidia is getting hit like this. Down 6% on the day.</p>
