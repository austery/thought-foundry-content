### 迷幻药的独特魅力：一次体验何以改变一生

我是马特·约翰逊，约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的精神病学和行为科学教授。我研究各种药物：兴奋剂、镇静剂以及全方位作用的药物。在过去近二十年里，我研究最多的药物类别是**迷幻药**（英文 Psychedelics: 源于希腊语，意为“心灵显现”，指一类能显著改变人的意识、情绪和感知的药物）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm Matt Johnson. I'm a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins. I study drugs, all kinds of drugs: uppers, downers, all-arounders. The drug class that I've studied most over the last, nearly couple of decades, are the psychedelic compounds.</p>
</details>

我在二十多年前，也就是二十出头的时候，就开始对包括迷幻药在内的各种药物产生了兴趣。我着迷于迷幻药在我们文化中的历史，以及早期曾有过医学研究的事实。我对精神活性化合物的迷恋与日俱增。无论是可卡因、咖啡因，还是迷幻药，这些物质如何影响我们的行为，你将少量物质摄入体内，它们有时就能彻底改变你的主观体验和行为方式，这个想法让我着迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I developed an interest in drugs, including psychedelics, over 25 years ago in my early 20s. I was fascinated by the history of psychedelics in our culture; the fact that there was medical research in the early days; and I just had this growing fascination with psychoactive compounds in general. The idea that any of these substances, whether we're talking about cocaine, caffeine, you name it, including the psychedelics, how these things affect our behavior, how you put these small amounts of a substance in your body, and they can have, at times, radical changes in your subjective experience and what you do.</p>
</details>

在药物领域，很难想象有比迷幻药更具跨学科性的主题了。迷幻药横跨了太多有趣的领域。它们似乎自古以来就被地球上许多不同文化的原住民所使用。在我们西方的文化历史中，它们在1960年代真正爆发，并与一些非常激进的社会变革联系在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's hard to imagine a more interdisciplinary topic in the realm of drugs than psychedelics. I mean, psychedelics crosscut so many interesting domains. They've apparently been used for time immemorial by indigenous cultures throughout many different cultures on the planet. In our own Western cultural history, they really exploded on the scene in the 1960s, and were associated with some really radical changes to society.</p>
</details>

而对我这个专注于药物对行为影响（无论是好是坏）的人来说，最有趣的是，迷幻药是我所知的唯一一类药物，有大量的故事——不仅仅是一两个——人们说他们在几十年前，也许是50年前，只服用过一次，就对他们整个人生产生了深远的影响。我想不出还有哪一类药物，人们声称只使用一次就能产生任何类型的治疗或有益效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what really is most interesting, to me, as someone who's really focused on the effects of drugs on behavior- whether it's the good, the bad, the ugly- psychedelics are the only drug class that I know of where you have not just one or two, but lots of stories of people saying they took this thing one time, some decades ago, maybe 50 years ago, and they say it had this profound impact on the course of their entire life. You know, I can't think of another drug class where people claim therapeutic or beneficial effects of any type when they used it only one time.</p>
</details>

以大麻为例，有很多治疗效果的例子，但我从未见过有人说他们20年前抽过一次大麻，之后再也没碰过，却能指出那一次经历如何彻底改善了他们的生活。而关于迷幻药，这样的故事数不胜数。当然不是每个人都如此，很多人只是尝试一下，觉得好玩，仅此而已。但令人惊讶的是，人们常常会说出一些非常惊人的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you take cannabis, you know, plenty of examples of therapeutic effects, but I've never met anybody who said they smoked pot one time 20 years ago, never touched it again, and yet they can point to how this has radically improved their life. Those stories are countless with psychedelics. Not everybody, plenty of people just try them, and they have fun, and that's it. But it's surprisingly common for people to say really outlandish things.</p>
</details>

比如，卡里·穆利斯（Kary Mullis）因发明**PCR**（Polymerase Chain Reaction: 聚合酶链式反应，一种革命性的分子生物学技术，可大量扩增特定的DNA片段）而获得诺贝尔奖，这项技术彻底改变了生物学。他说，如果他没有服用迷幻药的经历，他就不可能做到这一点。再看看艺术领域，天哪，谁没听说过音乐家和其他艺术家声称迷幻药对他们的创造力产生了深远影响呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize inventing PCR, which revolutionized biology. He said he wouldn't have been able to do that had he not had experience in taking psychedelics. You move into the arts and then, I mean, gosh, I mean, who hasn't heard of musicians and other artists claiming that psychedelics had a profound impact on their creativity?</p>
</details>

我记得在我快二十岁的时候，开始接触前几代人的音乐。嘿，有一支大家可能都听说过的乐队，叫披头士（The Beatles），你知道吗？哇，他们真的很棒。但当你探索他们的音乐时，你会发现有服用**LSD**（Lysergic acid diethylamide: 麦角酸二乙酰胺，一种强效的半人工致幻剂）之前的披头士，和服用LSD之后的披头士。这是一个巨大的转变，很多人尤其喜欢服用LSD之后的披头士。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I remember when I was coming of age and my late teens, discovering the music of earlier generations, and, "Hey, there's this band people have heard of, probably called The Beatles, you know? And wow, they're pretty good." But then you explore their music, and there's The Beatles before LSD, and then there's The Beatles after LSD. That's a big shift, and a lot of folks like the Beatles after LSD, especially so.</p>
</details>

### 术语辨析：“迷幻药”究竟意味着什么？

“Psychedelic”（迷幻药）这个词是由汉弗莱·奥斯蒙德（Humphry Osmond）创造的。当时，他还和奥尔德斯·赫胥黎（Aldous Huxley）通过信件交流。他们是朋友，来回通信，讨论着他们都深感兴趣的这类新药。他们交换了关于这类新药理想名称的想法。赫胥黎提出了一个拗口的词，被奥斯蒙德否定了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the term 'psychedelic' was coined by Humphry Osmond, who was writing letters, back when people wrote letters, to Aldous Huxley. And they were sending letters back and forth- they had a friendship-and they were discussing, they were both profoundly intrigued by this new class of drugs. And they were trading ideas about what the ideal name for this new drug class would be. And Huxley came up with some unpronounceable term that Humphry Osmond dismissed.</p>
</details>

让我看看能否记起奥斯蒙德写给赫胥黎的诗。他说：“欲探地狱或飞升天堂，只需一撮迷幻药。”（To fathom hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic.）“Psychedelic”从其语言学词根来看，意思是“心灵显现”（mind manifesting）。所以，我认为这是一个相当不错的术语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And let's see if I can recall the poem that Osmond wrote to Huxley. He said, "To fathom hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic." And what psychedelic means, from its linguistic roots, is "mind manifesting." And so I'd say that's a pretty good term.</p>
</details>

这类药物没有完美的术语。常用的“hallucinogen”（致幻剂）肯定不是一个好词，因为人们很少产生真正的幻觉，而且大家对幻觉的含义存在误解。但“psychedelic”这个词，即“心灵显现”的理念，与另一个概念——“非特异性放大器”（non-specific amplifiers）——是一致的。换句话说，你可能会有欣快的体验，也可能会有地狱般的体验。人类体验和情感领域中的任何一种情绪，都可能成为你的体验，并且被放大。这在很大程度上取决于你当时生活中的状况，而不是一种可靠的、固定的效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no perfect term for this drug class. Certainly hallucinogen, which is often used is not a great term 'cause very rarely do people have true hallucinations, and there's a misunderstanding of what that means. But the psychedelic, the idea that these are mind manifesting, that's consistent with this other notion that these are non-specific amplifiers. In other words, you could have a euphoric experience, you could have a hellish experience. You name it in the realm of human experience and emotions, that can be your experience, and it could be amplified. And it's very much a product of what's going on in your life at the time. It's not this reliable effect.</p>
</details>

所以，“显现心灵”、“深入挖掘心灵”、“放大心灵中已有的东西”，这些说法似乎与这些药物的临床观察结果大致相符。这个领域的术语非常困难，即使是专家也会有分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it seems like manifesting the mind, digging deeper into the mind, amplifying what is already there in the mind, that sort of generally fits with clinical observations with these drugs. Terminology is so difficult in this area, and even the experts will disagree.</p>
</details>

“Psychedelic”可以用来指所谓的“经典迷幻化合物”：**psilocybin**（英文 Psilocybin: 裸盖菇素，是“神奇蘑菇”中的主要精神活性成分）、LSD、**DMT**（Dimethyltryptamine: 二甲基色胺，一种强烈的致幻剂，存在于某些植物中，是南美死藤水的主要成分之一）和**mescaline**（英文 Mescaline: 麦司卡林，一种天然致幻剂，存在于佩奥特仙人掌等植物中）。这些是经典的迷幻药。它们作用于一种特定类型的**血清素受体**（英文 Serotonin Receptor: 存在于大脑中的蛋白质，是经典迷幻药产生作用的主要靶点），这是它们的主要作用机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Psychedelic can be used to refer to what are called the 'classic psychedelic compounds': psilocybin, which is in magic mushrooms, LSD, DMT, which is in ayahuasca, mescaline, which is in peyote- those are the classic psychedelics. They affect a certain particular type of serotonin receptor, and that's their primary mechanism of action.</p>
</details>

但还有其他药物也被称为迷幻药，我认为这样称呼是恰当的。其他科学家可能不同意，但它们有不同的作用机制，不属于经典迷幻药。例如，**MDMA**（3,4-亚甲二氧基甲基苯丙胺，俗称“摇头丸”或“莫利”，是一种具有共情和兴奋作用的药物）通过释放血清素起作用，这是一种不同的机制。其效果也与经典迷幻药不同，通常不那么强烈，更侧重于人的情感体验，更像是一次“心灵之旅”而非“头脑之旅”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then you have other drugs that are called psychedelic, and I think it's appropriate to call them psychedelic. Other scientists will disagree, but they have a different mechanism. They're not classic psychedelics. So for example, MDMA will work by releasing serotonin; so that's a different mechanism. And its effects are different than the classic psychedelics, typically not as intense, typically more focused on one's emotional experience, more of a heart trip than a head trip.</p>
</details>

还有其他药物，如**ketamine**（英文 Ketamine: 氯胺酮，一种解离性麻醉剂，低剂量下具有迷幻效果）。它主要影响大脑中的谷氨酸系统，而不是血清素系统。尽管有证据表明经典迷幻药在血清素下游也会影响谷氨酸，但像氯胺酮和PCP这类药物，它们最初影响的是大脑的谷氨酸能系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you have other drugs, such as ketamine. So that affects the glutamate system in the brain primarily rather than the serotonin system. Even though there's evidence that the classic psychedelics downstream for serotonin, they also affect glutamate. But nonetheless, the drugs like ketamine and PCP, which are in the same class as each other, they initially affect the glutamatergic system in the brain.</p>
</details>

那么，如果“psychedelic”这个词指的是多种具有不同作用方式的潜在药理学类别的药物，它到底意味着什么呢？对我来说，答案是，这些药物都能对一个人的现实感，包括自我感，产生深远的影响。而我认为，我们通常所说的兴奋剂、镇静剂或阿片类药物通常不会如此。人们会感觉不同，但远不及这些迷幻化合物带来的体验那么极端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does psychedelic mean, then, if it refers to multiple underlying classes, pharmacological classes of drugs that work in different ways? And the answer for me is that these are all drugs that can have a profound effect on one's sense of reality, including one's sense of self. And I would say that typically isn't the case for what we think of as the stimulants or the sedatives or the opioids. People feel different, but not as extremely as with these psychedelic compounds.</p>
</details>

当我2004年刚开始从事迷幻药研究时，很难发表一篇使用“psychedelic”这个词的论文。在学术界和科学界，“hallucinogen”（致幻剂）是迄今为止的首选术语。值得庆幸的是，情况已经改变了。我认为这是因为足够多的科学家，像我一样，不断尝试使用这个词，并论证它是一个更好的术语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I first started in psychedelic research in 2004, it was hard to get a paper published using the word psychedelic. Hallucinogen, by far, was the preferred term in academia in science. Thankfully, that's changed. And I think it's because enough scientists, like myself, kept trying to use the term, in arguing that it's a better term.</p>
</details>

我不喜欢“hallucinogen”这个词的原因之一是，它侧重于感知领域。很多对迷幻药不太了解的人想当然地认为这是其主要机制。换句话说，有人听到一些研究后会说：“我不明白，为什么看到东西，看到幻觉，比如粉色大象，就会让你想戒烟？我搞不懂。”这是因为他们只关注迷幻药的感知方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, hallucinogen, one, the reasons I don't like hallucinogen as a term, is that it focuses on the perceptual realm, which a lot of people who aren't very familiar with psychedelics, they just assume that's the primary mechanism. In other words, someone will hear about some of the research and say, "I don't get it, why would seeing things, hallucinations, what are you seeing, pink elephants, and that makes you want to quit smoking? Like, I don't get it," people will say. And that's 'cause they're focused on this perceptual aspect of psychedelics.</p>
</details>

感知效果之所以受到如此多的关注，可能是因为这些方面更容易描述。比如，“是的，墙壁看起来像在波动。”这不正常，我可以描述它是什么样的。而要用语言来描述自我认同的消解，描述超越常规描述的自我感，比如“我多大年纪，我是男性，我来自哪个国家”——所有这些我们定义自己的方式，当它们被完全剥离后剩下的是什么，这就进入了难以描述的深层哲学领域。描述“我看到了一些疯狂的颜色”则要容易得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And probably the reason that the perceptual effects have gotten so much attention is those are the aspects that are easier to describe. Like, "Yeah, the walls look like they were waving." That's not normal. I can describe what that is. Like, what the hell is going on? Trying to wrap language around dissolving the sense of identity, having some sense of who I am beyond the normal descriptors, you know, "I'm so old, I'm a male, I'm this, I'm from this country," all these ways we define ourselves, just when they're completely stripped away and what's left, I mean, we're getting into deep philosophical realms there that are really hard to describe. It's easy to describe, "I saw some crazy-ass colors."</p>
</details>

所以我认为，对感知效果的关注已经固化为大众对这些药物作用的理解。因此，“hallucinogen”这个词只关注了迷幻药效果中一个相对随意的方面。实际上，在治疗中，我们让人们戴上眼罩的原因之一就是不希望他们整个过程都只关注波动的墙壁和强烈的色彩。这很棒，药物效果持续六个小时，他们总得起来上个厕所，那时他们会看到波动的墙壁。不是每个人都有这些感知效果，但他们会有这个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think this is sort of stuck, the focus on perceptual effects has sort of stuck as sort of the lay understanding of what these drugs do. Hallucinogen, therefore, it focuses on this one relatively arbitrary aspect of psychedelic effects. And that's why, actually, in therapy, one of the reasons we have people wear eye shades is we don't want them focusing the entire time on the wavy walls and the intense colors. And that's great. It's a six-hour drug effect. They're gonna have to get up and take a pee at some point. They'll get to see the wavy walls. You know, not everyone has those perceptual effects, but they'll have that opportunity.</p>
</details>

通过屏蔽外部干扰，我们希望人们能将体验更多地聚焦于内在，关于自我的本质，关于生活中的模式，关于世界正在发生的大局。否则，你可能会停留在那些漂亮的颜色上。漂亮的颜色很棒，但如果你深入挖掘体验，可能会发现其下有更有价值的东西。所以我不喜欢“hallucinogen”这个词，因为它只关注感知领域，这只是一个微不足道的方面，甚至不是这些化合物的关键治疗方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By blocking out the external distractions, the idea is one can focus the experience more internally about the nature of yourself, about these patterns in your life, about the big picture of what's going on in the world. The idea is you might get stuck at the pretty colors. And the pretty colors are great, but there might be something even more valuable underneath that if you dig deeper into that experience. And so I don't like the word 'hallucinogen' in that it just focuses on that perceptual realm, which is kind of just a trivial aspect and not even the key therapeutic aspect of these compounds.</p>
</details>

此外，“hallucinogen”暗示这些药物会引起幻觉，而根据严格的精神病学定义，这些药物很少引起真正的幻觉。如果你有幻觉，意味着你观察到、感知到环境中你确信存在的东西。有人真的认为房间里有一头粉色大象，这是一个经典的例子，那才是幻觉。你以为你在和朋友进行长时间的交谈，然后你转头发现，“哦，那个朋友根本不在那里。”那是幻觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, hallucinogen implies that these drugs cause hallucinations, and the strict psychiatric definition of a hallucination, these drugs rarely cause those. If you have a hallucination, it means you are observing something, you're perceiving something in the environment that you actually believe is there. Someone really thinks a pink elephant, to use a classic example, is really in the room. That's a hallucination. You thought you were talking to a friend and having this long conversation, and then you look over and realize, "Oh, that friend was never there." That's a hallucination.</p>
</details>

使用迷幻药时，你通常会得到的是视觉错觉或可以称之为“假性幻觉”的东西。通常情况下，现实检验能力是完好的，这是一个花哨的说法，意思是墙壁像毯子或海滩上的波浪一样波动，这可能非常令人印象深刻。但通常，这个人知道，在现实中，墙壁并没有真的在波动。他们意识到他们看到墙壁波动的原因是他们服用了这种物质。所以，你通常不会得到真正的幻觉，因此这不是一个好词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What you typically get with psychedelics are more visual illusions or what you could call 'pseudohallucinations.' Typically, reality testing is intact, which is a fancy way of saying the wall's waving like a blanket or like waves on the beach. That might be really impressive. But typically, the person knows, in reality, the walls really aren't waving. They realize the reason they're seeing walls waving is because they've taken this substance. So you, you really don't get, typically, true hallucinations, so it's not a great word.</p>
</details>

至于“entheogen”（启发神性剂），我从来不喜欢用这个词来指代一类药物。我喜欢在人类学意义上使用这个词。换句话说，“entheogen”的意思，从其语言学词根来看，一个常见的定义是“唤醒内在的神性”或“唤醒内在的上帝”。所以它实际上指的是这些化合物的圣礼、精神或宗教用途。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Entheogen, I've never been a fan of that word to refer to a drug class. I'm a fan of using that word in its anthropological sense. In other words, so what 'entheogen' means, one of the common definitions from its linguistic roots is "awakening the divine within," or "awakening God within." So it's really referring to this sacramental, spiritual religious use of these compounds.</p>
</details>

我的异议在于，任何一种精神活性物质都曾被用作启发神性剂。烟草、含有可卡因的古柯叶、阿片类药物。你更难找到一种从未在某个时刻被用作圣礼一部分的药物。所以我喜欢说某种特定物质的“启发神性用途”。它可以是原住民部落对烟草的启发神性用途，也可以是死藤水的启发神性用途。但我不想将那种特定物质定义为“启发神性剂”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My beef with that is that you name the psychoactive substance, it's been used as an entheogen. You know, tobacco, coca leaves, which contain cocaine, opioids. I mean, you'd be harder pressed to find the drug that hasn't been used as part of a sacrament at some point. So I like to refer to the entheogenic use of a particular substance. It could be the entheogenic use of tobacco by indigenous tribes. It could be the entheogenic use of ayahuasca. But I don't wanna define that particular substance as entheogenic.</p>
</details>

作为反例，几个高中生吃了些蘑菇，他们傻笑了一阵，看到了一些让他们惊叹的漂亮颜色，但他们并没有任何他们会描述为精神体验的东西，这听起来不像是一种“启发神性剂”。所以这有点武断——你只取了这些药物能做的一部分，却用那一种效果来定义整个药物类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then as a counterpoint, a couple of, yeah, high school kids that take some mushrooms, and they do a lot of giggling, and they see some pretty colors that really amaze them, and they don't really have anything that they would describe as a spiritual effect, that doesn't sound like an entheogen to me. So it's kind of an arbitrary- you're assigning just one portion of what these drugs can do, but you're defining the entire drug class with that one effect.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么我认为“psychedelic”（迷幻药）是一个足够宽泛的术语，可以涵盖所有这些体验：感知效果、潜在的精神效果，以及任何其他个人洞见等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's why I think the psychedelic is a broad enough term to encompass all of those experiences: the perceptual effects, the potential spiritual effects, and any other personal insights etc.</p>
</details>

### 被遗忘的历史：迷幻药研究的第一次浪潮

对迷幻药的第一次科学兴趣浪潮是在1950年代。那是在阿尔伯特·霍夫曼（Albert Hofmann）首次发现LSD的精神活性特性后大约十年。在接下来的十年里，他所在的瑞士制药公司山德士（Sandoz）相当慷慨地向医生们分发LSD样品进行研究。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first big wave of that scientific interest for psychedelics was in the 1950s. So this was, yeah, about a decade after Albert Hofmann had first discovered the psychoactive properties of LSD. And in that following decade, essentially the pharmaceutical company, Sandoz, that he worked for in Switzerland, pretty liberally sent out samples of LSD for physicians to do research with.</p>
</details>

我这里说的“研究”，不像现在的研究需要一年的审批，并且有高度严格的准入限制。当时的情况更像是：“嘿，我是一名医生，我很好奇想把这个给我的病人试试，看看会发生什么。”“当然，给你。”然后就从瑞士邮寄过来了。所以，当时有很多随意的研究性使用，但也有一些早期的临床试验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when I say research there, it's not like research now where you need a year's worth of approvals with this highly restricted access and everything. It was like "Hey, I'm a doctor, and I'm curious to give this to some of my patients to see what's up." "Sure, here you go." You know, put it in the post from Switzerland. And so, there was a lot of sort of casual research use, but there were also some early clinical trials.</p>
</details>

我认为这项工作历史上最重要的团队之一是加拿大萨斯喀彻温省由亚伯兰·霍夫（Abram Hoffer）和汉弗莱·奥斯蒙德（Humphry Osmond）领导的团队。他们可以说是第一个发展出我们现在所说的“迷幻疗法”的团队。这个理念是，你不仅仅是在模仿精神病，而这是最早的研究人员最初的想法，他们认为这些东西只是模仿精神病发作，模仿精神分裂症发作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say one of the most important groups in the history of this work was this group led by Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond in Saskatchewan, Canada. And they were really the first group that I would say developed what we now call 'psychedelic therapy,' this idea of that you're not just mimicking psychosis, which is what originally was thought by the very early researchers. All this stuff did was mimic people having a psychotic break, having a schizophrenic episode.</p>
</details>

这些萨斯喀彻温省的研究人员发现，如果你为人们做好准备，提供一个舒适的环境，让他们进行内省，躺在沙发上关注自己的体验，你就会得到一些通常与精神病完全相反的体验。这些体验被报告为人们一生中最有意义、最清晰、最清醒的经历之一。你可以用很多名字来称呼它，超验体验、神秘体验、富有洞察力的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These Saskatchewan researchers figured out if you prepare people and have a comfortable environment and just have them introspect, lay on a couch and pay attention to their experience, you had these experiences that oftentimes were anything but psychotic. I mean, they were reported to be some of the most meaningful, clear, lucid experiences of people's lives. And you could use many names, a transcendental experience, mystical experience, insightful experience.</p>
</details>

当时还有其他一些团队，比如马里兰州的Spring Grove团队，在那里进行了很多早期研究，特别是针对癌症患者。但在这之后，研究被搁置了几十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there was some development, there was other groups. There was a group in Maryland called the Spring Grove group. A lot of early research there, particularly with cancer patients. But then the research was really put on hold for several decades after this period.</p>
</details>

在从1950年代到1970年代初的第一波研究中，人们越来越认识到一些风险以及需要采取的防范措施来最小化这些风险。但并非每个研究者都意识到了这一点，有些人是随着时间的推移才逐渐意识到的，这是一个演变过程。但有些研究，嘿，他们给某人注射了巨大剂量的LSD，然后把他们锁在软垫房间里。

<p class="english-text">In the first wave of research from the 1950s through early '70s, there was this growing appreciation of some of the risks and the safeguards needed to minimize those risks. But not every investigator was aware of this. And some of them were only aware of this as time went on, so it was an evolution. But some of the research just, hey, they gave a giant dose of LSD to someone and then locked them in a padded room.</p>
</details>

其中一项旨在观察LSD是否能帮助酗酒者的试验，他们真的把人绑在医院病床上，给他们注射了800微克的超大剂量LSD。而且他们没有给任何警告，比如，他们服用的这种物质会深刻地改变他们的意识体验。从那时起，我们学到了很多，那种研究……正是在那种条件下，你会得到更像精神病的体验。你把人当成会发疯的人来对待，很多时候他们至少会暂时感觉自己要疯了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So one of the trials looking to see if LSD could help people with alcoholism, they literally tied people down in restraints to their hospital bed, gave them a massive dose of LSD, 800 micrograms, which is a really big dose. And they didn't give them any warning that, like, they took this substance that would profoundly alter their conscious experience. So we've figured out a lot since then, that sort of research. Those are the conditions under which, when you do get experiences that look more like psychosis, you treat the person like they're gonna go crazy. And a lot of times they, at least temporarily, they feel like they're going crazy.</p>
</details>

然后是围绕哈佛大学蒂莫西·利里（Timothy Leary）的争议。他早期做了一些非常棒的研究。但即使在哈佛期间，他也会在周六晚上邀请人们到他家，包括研究人员在内的每个人都服用药物。值得庆幸的是，我们已经摆脱了那种做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there was controversies surrounding Timothy Leary at Harvard. He did some really great research early on. And even while he was at Harvard, having people over at his house on a Saturday night, and everyone taking it, including the researchers. So we've moved away from that, thankfully.</p>
</details>

天哪，我应该提一下，在那个更早的时代，中央情报局（CIA）也在认真研究这些药物，作为其**MKUltra计划**（MKUltra Program: 美国中央情报局（CIA）在1950年代至1970年代进行的一项非法人体实验计划，旨在研究精神控制技术）的一部分。这不是都市传说。通过《信息自由法》解密的大量材料揭示了这段历史。他们有时会在不知情或未经同意的情况下，通过单向镜给美国公民下药。例如，人们去拜访性工作者，他们被递上一杯水，里面含有大剂量的LSD，而CIA的打手们就站在单向镜后面观察会发生什么。所以，当时显然有像那样极不道德的研究在进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And gosh, I should mention in that earlier era, this is also when the CIA was seriously investigating these drugs as part of their MKUltra program. This is not urban legend. There's lots of declassified material through the Freedom of Information Act that has revealed this history. They were giving it, at times, to just American citizens without their knowledge or consent behind a mirror. People visiting a sex worker, for example. Glass of water they're given and big dose of LSD, and these goons from the CIA are standing behind this one-way mirror, like, just observing to see what would happen. So you had, obviously, highly unethical research like that going on.</p>
</details>

在很多方面，我认为今天我们对这些化合物的主要风险已经非常清楚了。希望伦理观念已经进步，人们认识到这是非常严肃的事情，不要低估你可能对某人造成的伤害，比如在他们的饮料里偷偷加入LSD。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, on a lot of these dimensions, I mean, I think it's pretty clear today what the major risks of these compounds are. And hopefully, just ethics have improved the recognition of it. This is very serious, and don't underestimate the damage you can do to someone, like slipping out LSD into their drink.</p>

### 迷幻药的复兴：从非法管制到医疗前沿

大多数迷幻药在世界上大多数国家都是非法的。有一些例外，但我们知道的主要经典迷幻药，如裸盖菇素蘑菇（即所谓的“神奇蘑菇”）、LSD、含有DMT的死藤水、以及存在于佩奥特仙人掌和其他仙人掌中的麦司卡林，在大多数国家不仅非法，而且属于最严格的管制类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most psychedelics aren't legal in most countries in the world. There are some exceptions, but the primary classic psychedelics we know of, psilocybin mushrooms, or so-called magic mushrooms, or LSD, ayahuasca, which contains the compound DMT, mescaline in peyote and other cacti. In most countries, these are not just illegal, but in the most restrictive class.</p>
</details>

例如，在美国，它们被列为一级管制药品（Schedule 1），在英国则被列为A类药品（Schedule A），这都是针对最危险、滥用潜力最大且无公认医疗用途的化合物的最严格管制类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example, in the United States, they're in Schedule 1, or in the United Kingdom, they're in schedule A, same thing; it's the most restrictive class for the most dangerous compounds with the greatest abuse potential, and with no recognized medical use.</p>
</details>

当然，这其中也有一些细微差别。美国的一些州已经将裸盖菇素非刑事化，甚至在俄勒冈州，最近已经将在有指导的治疗性情境下使用裸盖菇素合法化。但总的来说，这些都是非法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there are some nuances to that. There have been some states in the U.S. that have decriminalized, or even in Oregon, recently, have legalized the use of psilocybin in the context of a therapeutic-like situation with a guide. But for the most part, these are illegal.</p>
</details>

现在正在进行的研究，很多都是通过FDA（美国食品药品监督管理局）的流程来探索医疗应用，这些研究都获得了FDA和DEA（美国缉毒局）的批准。因此，希望随着这些试验的推进，当我们进入所谓的“三期研究”——这是临床试验的最后阶段，通常参与者人数更多——这将是决定这种药物是否能被FDA批准为药物的最后阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the research that's happening now, a lot of it is exploring medical applications through the FDA process where there's FDA approval and DEA approval. So the hope is as these trials advance, and as we move into what's called 'phase 3 research,' that's the final level of a clinical trial, typically with a larger number of participants. That's the final phase that can decide whether or not this drug is gonna be approved as a medication by the FDA.</p>
</details>

我们很可能在未来两、三、四年内，看到多种迷幻药——取决于三期研究的结果——可能被批准用于治疗。如果发生这种情况，那么它们在医疗上使用将是合法的，但在其他情况下仍然是非法的。这与很多人可能不知道的情况类似，可卡因在某些医疗场合是合法使用的，甲基苯丙胺（冰毒）在某些医疗场合也是合法使用的，而我们大多数人都知道，各种阿片类药物在许多医疗场合都是合法使用的。所以，这将使这些化合物更接近那个类别：合法用于医疗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we're likely only two, three, four years away from multiple psychedelics potentially- depending on those phase 3 results- being approved for treatment. So if that happens, then they would be legal to be used medically, but they would still be illegal in another context. Similar to what a lot of people may not realize that cocaine is legal to use in certain medical settings. Methamphetamine is legal to use in certain medical settings. All kinds of opioids, as most of us know, are legal to use in many medical settings. So it would be moving these compounds into more of that category: legal for medical use.</p>
</details>

在未来几年内，根据最终结果，可能被批准用于医疗的化合物是MDMA（有些人可能知道它在街头被称为“莫利”或“摇头丸”）和裸盖菇素（存在于所谓的“神奇蘑菇”中）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The compounds that are likely to be approved, depending on the final results, in the next few years for medical use are MDMA, which some people might know as Molly or ecstasy on the street, and psilocybin, which is in so-called magic mushrooms.</p>
</details>

### 迷幻药的真实风险与核心效应

迷幻药可以引发各种主观变化，涵盖思想、认知方式、感觉等多个方面。它们有时能深刻地影响你的感觉强度和多变性。你可以在恐惧的体验和美好的、一生中最奇妙的体验之间摇摆。所以，主观体验的任何方面，包括自我认同、一个人如何定义自己、如何定义现实，都可能受到影响。我认为这些是迷幻药最深层、也最与其治疗效果相关的方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so psychedelics can prompt a wide variety of subjective changes. And so that can span thoughts: the way you think, your cognition. Feelings: very profoundly at times, the intensity of your feelings, the variability. You can swing from a terrifying experience to this beautific, sort of like most amazing experience of your life. So the variability, the intensity is there. So really any aspect of subjective experience, including self-identification, how one holds- how they define themselves, how they define reality. These are sort of the deepest aspects that I think and the aspects that are most aligned with the psychedelics' therapeutic effects.</p>
</details>

我们通常讨论药物时会提到一个方面，即它们对生理机能的影响，而迷幻药在这方面的影响相对较低。与主观体验的强度相比，这些物质对我们生物功能的影响之小是惊人的。比如你的心率、血压。其他药物类别如何导致过量死亡？人们喝太多酒、服用太多阿片类药物，导致呼吸停止。某些药物因为服用过量而损害肝脏。服用过多兴奋剂导致中风或心脏病发作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One aspect that we typically talk about with drugs, in general, that's relatively low for the psychedelics, are just their effect on physiology. Compared to the intensity of the subjective effects, it's remarkable how little impact these substances have on our biological functioning. So your heart rate, your blood pressure. How do people overdose on other drug classes? They drink so much, they take so many opioids, they stop breathing. Some drug kills their liver 'cause they've taken too much of it. They had too much of a stimulant, and they have a stroke or heart attack.</p>
</details>

迷幻药在生理层面上非常安全。当然也有例外，例如，对于心脏病高风险人群，它确实会轻微升高血压和脉搏。但与其他药物类别相比，所有这些生理效应与主观效应的强度相比都相形见绌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Psychedelics are really robustly safe at the physiological level. There are exceptions. For example, people at very high risk for heart disease. It does raise the blood pressure and pulse somewhat, but all of those physiological effects really pale in comparison- compared to other drug classes-pale in comparison to the intensity of the subjective effects.</p>
</details>

因此，真正重要的是那些与个人对自己生活宏图的构想、如何定义自己、如何定义现实相关的主观体验层面。这就是为什么我认为像**神秘体验**（mystical experience：一种心理学构念，指个体感受到与宇宙或神性合一、超越时空、难以言喻的深刻体验）这样的经历如此重要，它包括一种合一感，与宇宙其他部分合一，或与全人类合一。当一个人从这种体验中走出来时，就有可能重塑我们正在谈论的任何障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it really is those levels of subjective effects that are relate to one's conception about the big picture of their life, how they define themselves, how do they define reality, which is why I think something like the mystical experience, which includes this sense of oneness, being at one with the rest of the Universe, or being at one with the rest of humanity, someone comes out of that, and that has the potential to reframe whatever disorder we're talking about.</p>
</details>

比如，重塑他们已经说服自己的成瘾问题，“哦，我就是个失败者，我永远也做不到。”拥有这样的体验可以真正地将此重新定义为小事一桩。再比如，从抑郁的角度思考自己，以及那种自我实现的预言。所以，我认为，真正起作用的是一个人如何定义自己的最深层次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reframing this addiction that they've convinced themselves, "Oh, I'm just a failure, I can never do it." Having an experience like that can really reframe that as, frankly, as small potatoes, and thinking about yourself in terms of depression, and this sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. So it really are those, how one defines themselves, I think, it's at the deepest levels.</p>
</details>

### 迷幻药如何在大脑中工作？

一个经常被提出的重大问题是：这些迷幻药是如何起作用的？你可以从很多不同的角度来探讨这个问题。最大的分歧在于我们是在谈论心理层面还是生物层面。它是通过作用于大脑受体并产生其他效应起作用，还是因为体验本身起作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the huge question that's always thrown out is: How do these psychedelics work? And you can just come at that from so many different angles. Kind of the biggest divide is whether we're talking about on the psychological side or the biological side. Does it work by hitting these brain receptors and then having other effects, or does it work because of the experience? And the first thing I like to say about that is these are two sides of the same coin.</p>
</details>

我想说的第一件事是，这是同一枚硬币的两面。可以推断，每一种心理体验都有其生物学上的对应物，无论我们现在是否意识到这一点。比如，你看到绿色，你的大脑中就发生了编码绿色体验的事情。所以我们需要摆脱非此即彼的思维方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Presumably, every psychological experience has a biological correlate, whether we're aware of that now. Like, you see the color green, there's something happening in your brain that's coding that experience of the color green. So we need to move away from thinking it's one or the other.</p>
</details>

迷幻药非常有趣，因为我认为它们正好处于那个有趣的交界处。显然，存在一种非常真实的生物效应。当你将迷幻药注入系统时，大脑会发生戏剧性的变化，然后人会产生一种体验。当他们因此改变生活时，这听起来更像是他们经历了一次非常好的心理治疗，或者是一次改变人生的经历，就像有人会说生孩子改变了他们，或者结婚改变了他们，或者第一次坠入爱河，或者第一次访问另一种文化。这些都是改变人的生活经历。所以，迷幻药在生物学和心理学之间的哲学桥梁上非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And psychedelics are really interesting 'cause I think they're just, like, they're placed right at that interesting interface. Clearly, there's this very real biological effect. Something dramatic happens to the brain when you put the psychedelic in the system, but then someone has this experience. And when they change their life because of that, that ends up sounding more like they went through a really good course of psychotherapy, or they had a life-transforming experience, the way someone might say, "Well, having children changed them, or getting married changed them, or falling in love for the first time or visiting another culture for the first time." Sort of like these life experiences that change people. So psychedelics are really interesting at that bridge, philosophically, between the biological and the psychological.</p>
</details>

现在，沿着生物学的路径走下去，正在发生的事情有很多，我们知道很多，但还有更多需要弄清楚。首先发生的是，裸盖菇素在你吃了它之后，一旦在血液中循环，它实际上会转化为一种相关的化合物，叫做裸盖菇辛（psilocin），这才是真正作用于大脑受体的物质，它会激活一种血清素受体的亚型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, to go down that biological path, what's happening, there's a lot going on, and we know a lot, but there's a whole lot more to figure out. The first thing that happens is that psilocybin, once it's circulating through your blood after you've eaten some of it, well, it actually converts to a related compound called psilocin, which is the thing that's actually hitting the brain receptors, and it activates a subtype of serotonin receptor.</p>
</details>

我们大脑中有很多不同类型的血清素受体，其中一种叫做**血清素2A受体**（Serotonin 2A receptor）。裸盖菇素和其他经典迷幻药可以像血清素一样附着在这些大脑受体上。但它们做的事情不同，因为显然，我们现在大脑中都漂浮着的血清素本身并不是迷幻的。但当这种物质激活受体时，神经元内部会发生一些不同的事情，并将这种效应向下游传播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have lots of different types of serotonin receptors in our brain. One is called the serotonin 2A receptor. And psilocybin and the other classic psychedelics can latch onto that the same way that serotonin latches onto these brain receptors. But they do something different, 'cause clearly serotonin itself, which we all have floating in our brains right now, is not psychedelic. But when this activates the receptor, something different happens within that neuron, and it propagates this effect downstream.</p>
</details>

我们现在知道，其他神经递质系统也参与其中。例如，我们知道谷氨酸系统也参与其中。所以裸盖菇素影响血清素，然后血清素影响谷氨酸系统。你可以把它想象成血清素2A是第一块多米诺骨牌。我想象那种房间里有一百万块多米诺骨牌的装置，一块推倒另一块，然后它爬上一个梯子，转动一个小东西，然后掉下来，诸如此类。血清素2A只是故事的开端，是你推倒的第一块多米诺骨牌，然后是谷氨酸系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we now know that, then, other neurotransmitter systems are involved. For example, we know the glutamate system is involved. So psilocybin effects serotonin, but then serotonin affects the glutamate system. And so you can think about it as if the serotonin 2A is the first domino. I think one of those set-ups with the million dominoes in the room where one knocks down the other, and then it goes up a ladder, and it spins a little thing and falls down, and all of that. The serotonin 2A is just the beginning part of the story. It's that first domino you knock over, and then you have the glutamate system.</p>
</details>

在另一个层面上，也许这就像是后退一步，观察整个房间的多米诺骨牌，超越了哪些受体受到影响，甚至超越了哪些大脑区域变得更活跃或更不活跃，一个非常有趣的分析层面是：大脑各区域之间的交流性质发生了什么变化？这被称为“静息态”。大脑网络动态是什么？大脑不同区域活动之间的关系是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then at another level, maybe this is sort of panning back and viewing that whole room full of dominoes, but at another level of analysis beyond what receptors are affected, and even, like, beyond what brain areas are become more active or less active, a really interesting level of analysis is: What's the nature of the communication across the brain that's changed? This is referred to as 'resting state.' What are the brain network dynamics? What's the relationship between the activity across different areas of the brain?</p>
</details>

有趣的是，当迷幻药在系统中起作用时，你会看到通常不交流的大脑区域之间的交流急剧增加。你可以通过这些不同区域的活动突然变得更加相互关联来判断这一点。它们通常各自行动，做自己的事情。我们的大部分心理和思维过程都是 compartmentalized（区隔化）的。“你做你的，我做我的”，我们只在必要时才进行整合。但似乎，大脑中这些不同的“筒仓”之间的交流发生了大规模的增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's interesting is when the psychedelic is on, in the system, you see a massive increase in communication across brain areas that don't normally communicate. And you could tell this by the activity in those different areas is all of a sudden much more correlated with each other. And so they're normally moving and grooving and doing their own things. Much of our psyche and our mental processes are compartmentalized. You know, "You do your own thing, and you do your own thing," and we only sort of integrate it when it's necessary. But it seems like you kind of, like, have this massive increase in communication across these different silos in the brain.</p>
</details>

这可能是一个重要的分析层面，它在心理层面上支撑了人们声称的洞见、非凡体验、从根本不同的视角看待自己。这就像是对一个人现实体验的巨大震撼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is probably an important level of analysis that is underlying, at the psychological level, claims of insight, claims of extraordinary experiences, viewing themselves from a radically different perspective, from a different lens. It's sort of this, like, massive shake-up in one's experience of reality.</p>
</details>

所以，我们从受体层面，到大脑激活层面，再到大脑的网络交流层面，最后到由此展开的心理体验。然后，可以推断，我们获得长期行为改变的方式是，那个人开始改变他们的生活。他们实际上学到了教训。而且，根据动物研究，似乎系统中可能存在增强的**可塑性**（英文 Plasticity: 指大脑神经系统根据经验和环境变化而改变其结构和功能的能力），即**神经可塑性**（Neuroplasticity）。因此，在迷幻体验后的几天里，人们更容易学习新事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, here we've gone through the receptor level to the brain activation level to the network communication levels of the brain, to what's the psychological experience that unfolds from that. And then, presumably, the way we get long-term behavior change is that that person starts to change their life. They actually learn lessons. And there also seems like there may be, based on animal research, increased plasticity, neuroplasticity in the system so that in the days following the psychedelic experience, people are more primed to learn new things.</p>
</details>

有一种更强的“粘性”，一种建立新的、希望是更优化的正常状态的更强能力。然后，如果这种状态得到加强和维持，它就变成了新的习惯。这就是为什么我们看到六个月后，人们感觉更好了，无论是吸烟减少了，还是抑郁减轻了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, there's a greater sticking power, there's a greater ability to establish a new and hopefully a more optimal normal state. And then if that is sort of reinforced and maintained, then that just becomes the new habit. And that's why we are seeing people six months later that are feeling better, whether they're smoking less, or they're less depressed.</p>
</details>

经典迷幻药和MDMA之间的一个主要区别在于它们与血清素系统相互作用的方式。它们都与血清素系统相互作用，但方式非常不同。我们应该记住，典型的抗抑郁药也与血清素系统相互作用，但方式也截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a major difference between the classic psychedelics and MDMA is in how they're interacting with the serotonin system. They're both interacting with the serotonin system, but in very different ways. I mean, we should keep in mind that typical antidepressants also interact with the serotonin system, but in a very different way.</p>
</details>

经典迷幻药模仿血清素在该受体位点上的作用。神经传递，即大脑交流的工作方式是，这里有一个神经元，一个脑细胞，这里有一个。为了让信号传播，进行交流，一个信使被发送到这两个神经元之间的小间隙中，这些就是我们所说的神经递质。少量血清素被释放到这个空间，它移动过去并激活，坐在这边的这个小口袋里。这就像棒球里，受体是捕手的手套。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the classic psychedelics, they're mimicking the effects of serotonin on that receptor site. So the way neurotransmission works, brain communication works, is you have one neuron here, one brain cell and neuron here, and one here. And in order to have a signal propagate, a communication, a messenger is sent across this little gap in-between those two neurons, and those what we call neurotransmitters. A little serotonin is released into this space, and it travels over and it activates, it sits in this little pocket on this side. This is like, you know, baseball, the receptor is the the catcher's mitt.</p>
</details>

在经典迷幻药的情况下，通常是一个普通的棒球被扔进那个捕手的手套里。现在我们想象我们换掉了，我们拿走了投手，拿走了普通的白色棒球，现在我们放了一个扎染的棒球进去——这就是裸盖菇素棒球。现在它被扔到两个细胞之间的那个空间里，被那个捕手的手套接住。这对捕手（在这个比喻中）产生的反应与血清素本身不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the case of the classic psychedelics, it's normally a regular baseball that is thrown into that catcher's mitt, Now we imagine we've swapped out, we've taken the pitcher, and we've taken the regular white baseball, and now we've put like this tie-dye baseball in there- this is like the psilocybin baseball. Now that's being thrown out into that space in between the two cells. And that's being captured in that catcher's glove. And that has a different reaction on the, I guess, the catcher in this analogy, than serotonin itself would.</p>
</details>

MDMA则非常不同。MDMA是与天然血清素一起工作的。它不是在捕手这边产生差异化效应，而是导致投手，也就是通常向两个神经元之间空间发送血清素的那个神经元，导致投手只是扔出大量的球。所以现在，捕手在投手丘上，他们不断地被球砸中，因为这个投手疯了，扔出的血清素，或者说普通棒球，比平时多得多。这对系统的影响与经典迷幻药不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MDMA is very different. MDMA is working with natural serotonin. It's causing not this differential effect on the catcher's side, but it's causing the pitcher, the neuron that's normally sending out serotonin into that space between the two neurons, it's causing the pitcher to just throw out a massive increase in balls. So now, the catcher is on the mound, and they're just getting balls thrown at them left and right 'cause this pitcher's just going crazy, throwing out way more serotonin, or more normal baseballs than normally would. And so that has a different effect on the system than the classic psychedelics.</p>
</details>

所以，生物学上的工作方式有根本的不同，大多数有经验的使用者会告诉你，感觉也根本不同。经典迷幻药之间有更多的共性，比如LSD和神奇蘑菇或裸盖菇素，虽然有细微差别，但从宏观上看，与MDMA相比，它们非常相似。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a fundamentally different way in which the biology works, and most experienced users will tell you it feels fundamentally different. And there's more commonalities between the classic psychedelics, let's say LSD and magic mushrooms or psilocybin, shades of difference, but in the grand scheme of things, those are very similar compared to, on the other hand, MDMA.</p>
</details>

我们还有一些边缘案例，一些更奇特的化合物，比如5-甲氧基-DMT。我们的研究还处于早期阶段。可能血清素2A在5-甲氧基-DMT的主要效应中扮演的角色较小，但这尚未被明确证实。很多这些化合物，虽然我们有一个简单的说法，即血清素2A是主要受体，但实际上，它们大多数都会在不同程度上作用于大量的受体，所以这可能是一个复杂的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we have some edge cases, some more exotic compounds, 5-methoxy-DMT. We're still early in the research. It might be that serotonin 2A plays less of a role in the primary effects of 5-methoxy-DMT, but that's not definitively shown yet. A lot of these compounds, well we have a simplistic story about serotonin 2A being the primary receptor, but, in fact, most of them hit a large number of receptors to a different degree, so it can be a complex process.</p>
</details>

有大量证据表明，2A受体是介导经典迷幻药效应的关键受体。我们怎么知道的呢？我们知道有这些叫做“拮抗剂”的化合物，人们可以服用它们来阻断特定的受体。有一些化合物，比如氯胺色林（ketanserin），可以阻断血清素2A受体，而不影响其他受体。它也有一点其他作用，但其主要阻断作用是在血清素2A上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's substantial evidence that 2A is the key receptor that mediates the effects of classic psychedelics. How do we know that? We know that there are these compounds called 'antagonists' that people can take, and that will block a specific receptor. And so there are compounds, like ketanserin, that will block the serotonin 2A and not other receptors. It does a little bit, but it's primary blocking action is on the serotonin 2A.</p>
</details>

如果你阻断了血清素2A，突然之间，你可以给人们注射一大剂裸盖菇素，他们却什么也感觉不到。同样的事情也发生在大鼠身上。你可以训练大鼠说：“当我在你的实验前10分钟给你腹部注射裸盖菇素时，我们把你放进一个斯金纳箱里，你可以按压杠杆——在那些日子里给你裸盖菇素，按左边的杠杆会给你一个小食物丸。而在其他日子里，我们只给你腹部注射生理盐水，基本上是安慰剂，在那些日子里，按右边的杠杆会产生食物丸。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you block serotonin 2A, all of a sudden, you can give a big old dose of psilocybin to people, and they don't feel anything. And the same thing happens in rats. You can train rats to say, "When I've given you an injection of psilocybin in the belly, 10 minutes before your session, we put you in a sort of a skinner box where you can press levers- give you psilocybin on those days, the left lever is the one that gives you a little food pellet if you press it. And on other days where you just give you a saline injection, a placebo, essentially, in the belly, on those days, the right lever is what gives you, is produces the food pellet."</p>

如果我们这样做几周，突然之间，那只动物就能可靠地告诉我们它是否得到了裸盖菇素，这真的很了不起。然后你可以做一些有趣的事情，比如给它另一种化合物，比如LSD，突然之间，它会把它当作裸盖菇素来对待。所以这是一种强大的动物药理学测定方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then if we do that for a few weeks, all of a sudden, that animal is able to reliably tell us whether they've gotten psilocybin or not, which is really remarkable. And then you could do interesting things, like give another compound, like LSD, and all of a sudden, they'll treat it as if it was psilocybin. So it's a powerful pharmacological assay in animals.</p>
</details>

如果我们阻断那些大鼠的血清素2A受体，它们就无法再区分迷幻药和生理盐水注射——这与人类的研究非常一致。还有其他层面。你可以创造出所谓的“基因敲除”啮齿动物，它们从出生起就缺少血清素2A受体。在那些经过基因改造的基因敲除动物中，迷幻药不起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if we block the serotonin 2A receptor in those rats, they are no longer able to distinguish, to discriminate between a psychedelic and a saline injection- very consistent with the human work. And there's other layers. You can create rodents that are so-called 'knockouts,' where, from birth, they're lacking the serotonin 2A receptor. And in those genetically modified knockouts, psychedelics don't work.</p>
</details>

还有各种各样的证据，现有的经典迷幻药之间也存在非常非常紧密的相关性。如果你绘制出需要给予多少毫克的图表，也就是效力，无论是需要给予400毫克，还是像LSD那样只需要十分之一毫克，然后你将它与对血清素2A受体的亲和力相关联，也就是对那个受体的“粘性”，即那种化合物粘附到那个受体的可能性有多大，你会发现这是一个惊人地紧密的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's all kinds, and there's also a very, very tight correlation amongst the existing classic psychedelics. If you plot how many milligrams you need to give, so this is the potency, whether you need to give 400 milligrams or just a 10th of a milligram in the case of LSD, and you correlate that with the affinity for this serotonin 2A receptor, which is like the stickiness for that receptor, how is it likely that that compound, that drug is gonna stick into that receptor? That's an astonishingly tight correlation.</p>
</details>

所以，确实有大量证据表明，血清素2A是这些迷幻药的主要作用位点。很可能这些其他受体位点为效果增添了一些色彩，但我们知道，通过不同的方式，如果你去掉了2A，你就不会有任何实质性的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there really is substantial evidence that the serotonin 2A is the primary site of action for these psychedelics. And it's probably the case that these other receptor sites add some coloring to the effect, but we know that, in different ways, if you take out 2A, you don't have any substantial experience there.</p>
</details>

所以，只有我们称之为经典迷幻药的物质才会作用于2A受体。主要的例子是LSD、裸盖菇素、麦司卡林、DMT。像氯胺酮和PCP这样的药物主要影响谷氨酸系统作为它们的第一个作用位点。然后你还有其他化合物：MDMA释放血清素，所以这是对血清素系统的另一种作用形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So only what are we call the classic psychedelics hit 2A. So the primary examples being LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT. Drugs like ketamine and PCP affect the glutamate system primarily as their first sort of site of action. And then you have other compounds: MDMA releases serotonin, so that's a different form of action on the serotonin system.</p>
</details>

还有像salvinorin A这样的化合物，我做了第一个盲法人体试验，发现它是鼠尾草（salvia divinorum）中的主要活性剂。它激活一种叫做kappa阿片受体的阿片受体，这是不同的。我们想到的大多数阿片类药物都是mu阿片类药物：吗啡、海洛因、羟考酮，这些都是非常容易上瘾的化合物。kappa阿片系统非常不同，会导致一种非常不同种类的迷幻效果。所以它有自己独特的途径。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have compounds like salvinorin A, which I did the first human trials that were blinded that actually found an effect of that as the primary agent in salvia divinorum. That activates a type of opioid receptor called the kappa opioid receptor, which is different. Most of the opioids we think of are mu opioids: morphine, heroin, oxycodone, very addictive compounds. The kappa opioid system is very different and leads to a very different variety of psychedelic effects. So that has its own distinct pathway.</p>
</details>

伊波加因（Ibogaine）是一个有趣的例子。它影响了许多与不同迷幻药相关的各种机制。所以它几乎像一个万能的迷幻药，有不同的切入点。它在药理学上相当“混杂”。伊波加因之所以引人关注，是因为有传闻说人们用它克服了阿片类药物成瘾。而且似乎有一些非常令人信服的证据，即使在动物，在大鼠身上也是如此。伊波加因会显著减少它们对阿片类药物和可卡因等药物的自我给药行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ibogaine, that's an interesting one. That affects a lot of these various mechanisms that are at play with different psychedelics. So it's almost like a jack of all trades psychedelic with different points of entry. It's pharmacologically pretty promiscuous. Ibogaine is of interest because of the anecdotes of people overcoming opioid addiction with it. And there does seem to be some really compelling evidence, even in animals, in rats. Ibogaine will substantially decrease their self-administration of drugs, like opioids and cocaine.</p>
</details>

它似乎能使成瘾中发生的剧烈波动和我们所谓的奖赏系统，即中脑边缘系统，奖赏通路正常化。在成瘾中，这个系统会失调。即使在像大鼠这样的动物身上，你也会看到多巴胺的剧烈波动。而使用伊波加因，你会看到这种更趋于正常化的趋势，将那些剧烈波动抑制到更正常的范围内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems to normalize the wild fluctuations that happen within addiction and our so-called reward system, our mesolimbic system, the rewards pathway. And that becomes dysregulated in addiction. Even in an animal like a rat, you'll see these wild fluctuations of dopamine. And with ibogaine, you'll see this kind of more normalizing, kind of tamping down those wild fluctuations into more of the normal range.</p>
</details>

然而，人们担心伊波加因可能会伤害心脏病患者，这比经典迷幻药更令人担忧。人们担心它会延长心脏的所谓QT间期。所以，关于伊波加因是否有临床前景存在争议。一些人认为，它的潜在毒性效应如此之大，以至于它永远不会被批准为FDA的治疗药物。另一些人则不同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, there are concerns with ibogaine that it can hurt someone with heart disease, and that's more of a concern than with the classic psychedelics. There's concerns about prolonging the so-called QT interval in the heart. So there's debate about whether there's a clinical future for ibogaine. Some people argue that its top potential toxic effects are such that it's not gonna be ever approved as an FDA treatment. There's others that disagree.</p>
</details>

我实际上最感兴趣的是使用像裸盖菇素和LSD这样的药物来治疗阿片类药物成瘾，因为与伊波加因相比，这些药物的物理毒性非常低。我认为其中一些机制实际上可能是共享的。我们认为伊波加因独有的那些特性可能并非那么独特，也许我们在裸盖菇素和其他经典迷幻药中也看到了它们——但我们需要更多的研究来弄清楚这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm actually most interested in using something like psilocybin and LSD to treat opioid addiction because compared to ibogaine, these are remarkably low in physical toxicity. And I think some of these mechanisms may, in fact, be shared. It may be that some of those properties that we think that are unique to ibogaine aren't so unique and maybe that we're seeing them with psilocybin and the other classic psychedelics as well- but we'll need more research to figure that out.</p>
</details>

### 临床应用的陷阱与未来展望

这项临床工作的一个陷阱是，你很难找到比这更私密、更脆弱的心理干预了。人们在这些迷幻体验中处于最脆弱的状态，你不能夸大作为指导者、作为科学家，组织并参与其中一场体验所带来的责任感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the pitfalls of this clinical work is that you'd be hard pressed to find a more intimate and vulnerable psychological intervention for a person. People are at their most vulnerable in these psychedelic experiences, and you can't overstate the weight that comes with being in one of these sessions, having orchestrated one of these sessions as a guide, as a scientist.</p>
</details>

有些人会将其描述为一生中最重要的经历。这种情况很容易滋生滥用行为，如果我们没有适当的保障措施。所以，我们通常知道的所有滥用行为，性虐待首当其冲，这就是为什么建立某些机制很重要。我认为最好有多名指导者见证整个过程，无论他们都在房间里，还是一个在外面至少通过摄像头观看。但我们需要确保有多人参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people will describe as the most important experience of their life. That's just a situation that is ripe for abuses if we don't have the right safeguards there. So all of the abuses that we normally know about, sexual abuse being right up there, and that's why it's important to have certain mechanisms in place. I think it's better to have multiple guides that are witnessing the session, whether they're both in the room or one is outside, at least watching on camera. But we need to make sure multiple people are involved.</p>
</details>

我们需要限制治疗性触摸的使用，并围绕此获得知情同意。所以，可以握住某人的手，扶着他们的肩膀，但不要在过程中进行一些人所谓的广泛的身体工作，因为对某些人来说，这会导致界限问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We need to limit the use of therapeutic touch and have informed consent surrounding that. So holding someone's hand, holding their shoulder, but not doing extensive body work as some folks would like to call it during the session, because that's just gonna, for some people, that's gonna lead to boundary issues.</p>
</details>

不幸的是，我认为在这个迷幻药领域，临床医生和科学家可能会陷入我称之为“迷幻药例外论”的境地。这种观点认为，这些体验如此宏大，远远超出了我们通常在医学、临床心理学等领域处理的范畴，因此需要适用新的规则。蒂姆·利里（Tim Leary）经常说：“这太大了，科学游戏容纳不下。”这就像我们正常的规则无法约束它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And unfortunately, I think in this area with psychedelics, clinicians can get into, and scientists can get into a space that I call 'psychedelic exceptionalism,' where the idea is that these experiences are so big, and this is so far beyond what we normally deal with in medicine, in clinical psychology, you name it, that new rules apply. Tim Leary said this a lot: "This is too big for the science game." This is like our normal games can't contain this.</p>
</details>

我们需要采取相反的方法，要说：“正因为那种脆弱性，正因为这些体验的巨大重要性，我们更需要顽强地坚守那些临床界限，”那些你在成为医生、临床心理学家、社会工作者或护士时学到的伦理培训，所有这些职业。我们需要真正遵守那些可能看起来枯燥乏味的老旧伦理准则，因为它们将在这里受到真正的考验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We need to take the opposite approach and say, "Because of that vulnerability, because of the incredible gravity of these sessions, we need to even more tenaciously cling to those clinical boundaries," that ethics training that you learn when you're becoming a physician or a clinical psychologist or a social worker or a nurse, all of these professions. We need to really a adhere to those, what might seem like boring old ethical codes because they're gonna really be tested here.</p>
</details>

第二个陷阱是“形而上学中立性”。基本上，当人们触及那些宏大问题时，比如这些体验中发生的是与上帝的相遇，与祖先的相遇，访问不同维度等等，各种各样的解释都会出现，我们必须让患者在提出任何这些主张时自己做主。我们必须保持形而上学的中立。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the second pitfall would be 'metaphysical neutrality.' Essentially, when people butt up against those big picture questions, what's happening in these sessions is an experience of God, is an experience of ancestors, visiting different dimensions, you name it, all kinds of explanations that are provided, we just have to really let the patient drive the bus in terms of making any of those claims. We have to be metaphysically neutral.</p>
</details>

这并不意味着我们应该纠正某人。如果有人认为那是与耶稣或佛陀的体验，我们不应该说：“不不不，那不是。我们在这里保持中立。”它的意思是，我们只是不为他们做那种推断。我们只是支持他们的任何过程和他们从中得出的结论；那不是我们的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That doesn't mean we should correct someone. If someone thought that was an experience of Jesus or the Buddha, it's not on us to say, "No, no, no, no, no, that wasn't. We're being neutral here." What it means is we're just not making that inference for them. That we're just supporting whatever their process and their conclusions from this; it's not our job.</p>
</details>

一个非常具体的方面是，要真正避免在这些体验中强加宗教偶像。不幸的是，在这些房间里放一尊佛像已经变得司空见惯。我个人对佛像没有任何意见，它们非常令人愉快，但我认为在主流化这种治疗方法时，这样做是不合适的。我说BYOB，“带上你自己的佛像”（bring your own Buddha）或任何其他有意义的物品，无论是十字架，还是飞天意面怪的画。无论对你来说是什么，你和你孩子的照片，带上那些有意义的物品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a very concrete aspect of this is really staying away from the imposition of religious icons in these sessions. Unfortunately, it's become commonplace and typical to have a Buddhist statue in these rooms. I have nothing personally against Buddhist statues. They're very pleasant, but I don't think it's appropriate in mainstreaming this treatment. I say BYOB, "bring your own Buddha" or any other meaningful object, be it a crucifix, be it a flying spaghetti monster painting. Whatever it is for you, the pictures of yourself and your kids, bring those meaningful objects.</p>
</details>

我们必须克制自己，不要扮演上师、牧师的角色，不要在形而上学的层面上为患者填补那些答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we just have to check ourselves into playing guru, playing priest, playing at this metaphysical level where we're filling in those answers for patients.</p>
</details>

第三个陷阱是随意使用“意识”这个词，以及我们就迷幻药在科学上告诉我们关于意识的什么得出结论。其中一部分是我们需要在语言上更加精确。意识是一个相当草率的术语；它有很多含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third pitfall is being loose with the term consciousness, and the conclusions we're making about what psychedelics have scientifically told us about consciousness. One part of that is we just need more precision in our language. Consciousness is a pretty sloppy term; it means many things.</p>
</details>

这个词最令人印象深刻的用法是我们所说的“现象意识”（phenomenal consciousness）。这与所谓的**意识的难题**（Hard problem of consciousness: 由哲学家大卫·查默斯提出，指科学如何解释主观体验（即“感觉”本身）为何以及如何从物理过程中产生这一根本性问题）有关。那就是：为什么会有体验存在？为什么宇宙不只是由这些相互作用的物体组成，无论是人、动物还是其他东西？为什么任何人都有一个内在的体验？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kind of the most impressive use of the term is what we refer to as 'phenomenal consciousness.' And this relates to the so-called hard problem of consciousness. That is like: Why is there an experience at all? Why is not the universe just made out of these objects? Whether they're people, animals, other things that are interacting. Why is there an inside experience to anybody?</p>
</details>

回答这个问题似乎是不可能的。这就是为什么哲学家称之为“意识的难题”。所以，永远不要说永远。我对迷幻药研究解决意识的难题持开放态度。现在，我认为没有人能想出迷幻药可以做到这一点的方法，但这是一个值得努力的方向。但我们需要克制自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It appears impossible to answer that question. That's why philosophers call it "the hard problem of consciousness." So, never say never. I'm open to psychedelic research addressing the hard problem of consciousness. Right now, I don't think anyone can think of a way in which psychedelics can do that, but it's a worthy effort. But we need to check ourselves.</p>
</details>

其他时候，当我们使用“意识”这个词时，我们有时指的是自我认同，拥有一个自我概念。这与那些合一的体验或所谓的“自我死亡”有关。我认为我们可以通过迷幻药在意识的那个方面学到很多，因为有时人们没有自我感，或者至少他们的自我感被彻底改变了。所以我们可以学到更多关于支撑自我感的脑机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other things, when we use the term consciousness, sometimes we mean self-identity, having a self-concept. That relates to these experiences of unity or so-called 'ego death.' I think there's a lot that we can learn with psychedelics on that aspect of consciousness because sometimes people don't have a sense of self, or at least they have a radically altered sense of self. So we can learn a lot more about the brain mechanisms underlying the sense of self.</p>
</details>

还有其他被称为意识的东西，“通路意识”（access consciousness）。这就像你——你两秒钟前没有在想你的祖母，但现在你在想了，因为我用了“祖母”这个词。那是从你大脑的某个地方来的。那里有一个记忆。它当时不在你的意识中，但现在在了。这种被唤起、事物被带入意识的过程是什么？这也属于我认为迷幻药可以用来回答其中一些问题的范畴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's other things called consciousness, 'access consciousness.' This is sort of you have- you weren't thinking about your grandmother two seconds ago, but now you are 'cause I used the word grandmother. That's come from somewhere in your brain. There was a memory there. It wasn't in your awareness at the moment, but now it is. What is that process of being called forth of things being brought into awareness? That's also in the category where I think psychedelics can be brought to bear in answering some of these questions.</p>
</details>

然而，大多数关于迷幻药在大脑机制方面的研究，并没有解决任何这些关于意识的问题。大多数迷幻药在大脑中的研究都解决了迷幻药如何在大脑中起作用的问题。我认为，当我们自动地做出这样的跳跃：“嗯，迷幻药似乎对意识至关重要，所以如果我们弄清楚迷幻药是如何起作用的，那就告诉我们一些关于意识如何工作的基本原理，”我们就走上了一个滑坡，我们可能会开始欺骗自己。所以我们真的需要在语言上更加精确，更严格地钻研这些关于意识的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, most of the work that's been done with psychedelics in terms of the brain mechanisms, it has not addressed any of these questions of consciousness. Most of those, most of the psychedelic work in the brain has addressed how psychedelics work in the brain. And I think when we automatically make that leap of, "Well, psychedelics seem so fundamentally important to consciousness that if we figure out how psychedelics are working, that's telling us something fundamental about how consciousness is working," we're on a slippery slope there, we can start to fool ourselves. So we really have to have more precision in our language, and drill down more rigorously on these questions of consciousness.</p>
</details>

### 超越治疗：迷幻药与意识的终极问题

意识的难题指的是这个看似无法解决的问题：任何事物如何以及为何能够感知？为什么会有体验存在？我们拥有的关于现象意识——即存在某种体验的唯一证据是，我感觉到我正在拥有这种体验。我感觉到我是有意识的。而因为其他走来走去的、看起来像我的生物，其他人类，这是一种推测，可能是一个相当不错的推测，即他们也在拥有类似的体验——但实际上没有证据。比如，我如何证明你是有意识的？这似乎超出了经验科学的范畴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The hard problem of consciousness refers to this seemingly unsolvable problem of: How and why is anybody aware? Why is there an experience there? The only evidence that we have for phenomenal consciousness, the idea that there is some experience being had is that I feel that I'm having this experience. I feel that I'm conscious. And because other creatures walking around that look like me, other human beings, it's a presumption, probably pretty good one, that they were having a similar experience- but there's really no evidence. Like, how would I prove that you are conscious? That seems outside of the bounds of empirical science.</p>
</details>

你能做什么实验来证明成为别人是什么样的体验？这就是难题所在。内格尔（Nagel）的一个经典例子是：成为一只蝙蝠是什么感觉？成为我的狗是什么感觉？成为另一个人是什么感觉？可以推断，成为你是有某种感觉的，但似乎没有科学的方法来解释为什么会这样——这就是意识的难题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What experiment could you ever do to prove that there is an experience to be like somebody else? And that's what the hard problem is. That's one way it's been expressed. What is it like to be a bat? That's a classic example by Nagel. What is it like to be my dog? What is it like to be another person? Presumably, there is something that it's like to be you, but there seems to be no way, scientifically, to account for why that is- so that's the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
</details>

你如何解释这个？人们对迷幻药及其揭示意识本质的能力大做文章。所以，如果迷幻药能帮助我们破解意识的难题，那将是终极任务。我的意思是，这可能是最大的问题之一。它与宇宙从何而来？现实的本质是什么？这类问题同等重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you explain this? And a lot of is made out of psychedelics and their ability to inform the nature of consciousness. And so this would be the ultimate kind of task. If psychedelics could help us to crack the hard problem of consciousness, I mean, perhaps that's the biggest question out there. I mean, it's up there with like, where did the Universe come from? What is the nature of reality? It's really one of the biggies.</p>
</details>

事实上，一些非常有趣的问题是：心智或主观体验，是物理世界中涌现出来的东西吗？我们是否生活在这个物质世界中，而体验只是某种附带现象？或者，也许意识或体验是现实本质中更基本的东西。你可以进入哲学思想的领域，比如泛心论（panpsychism），即意识实际上是普遍存在的。它不是涌现出来的，而是弥漫在物质宇宙中，这两者是同一枚硬币的不同面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, some of the really interesting questions about: Is mind, or subjective experience, something that pops out of the physical world? Do we live in this material world where sort of experience is just some sort of epiphenomenon? Or, perhaps, consciousness or experience is something more fundamental to the very nature of reality. And you can go into realms of philosophical ideas, such as panpsychism, the idea that consciousness really pervades. It doesn't just emerge, but it pervades the material universe in that these are two different sides of the same coin.</p>
</details>

但人们似乎很自然地会去思考那些大问题。这就是为什么我认为，我们必须把这两件事分开：“嘿，很多人根据他们的经验说，他们相信迷幻药打开了一扇通往意识的窗户，或者给了他们关于意识本质的洞见。”但这并不构成科学证据，证明他们说的是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it seems pretty routine for people to kind of grapple with those big questions. That's why I'm- I think it's really important that we separate, you know, "Hey, a bunch of people say, based on their experiences, that they believe psychedelics open some window into consciousness or give them sort of insights into the nature of consciousness." But that doesn't constitute scientific evidence that what they're saying is actually true.</p>
</details>

所以这其实是一个很弱的论点。仅仅因为人们倾向于认为迷幻药为他们提供了关于意识本质的答案，这使得我们想要看看是否能更进一步，是否能做些什么来真正客观地利用迷幻药来解决一些意识问题，这很有趣。所以，这就是为什么有探索迷幻药在意识体验中的倾向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's kind of a weak argument, really. Just the fact that people tend to think that psychedelics have provided them with answers about the nature of consciousness, it makes it intriguing to see if we can go further, if we can do anything to really objectively harness psychedelics to solve some problems of consciousness. So that's why the inclination is there to explore psychedelics in the experience of consciousness.</p>
</details>

但我们应该脚踏实地。就像对待任何科学问题一样，我们不应该屏息以待答案。仅仅是追求那个提问的旅程，无疑会得出重要的答案。它们可能不是我们所问问题的答案，但可能是其他问题的答案。所以，如果我能想出一个可以用迷幻药来解决那个问题的实验，我早就做了那个实验了。现在，我认为没有人能做到，但我认为我们应该对迷幻药可能被用来解决难题的可能性保持开放态度。但我们需要思考这个问题，因为这确实看起来是一个难以破解的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we should just be very well-grounded. And like with any scientific question, we shouldn't hold our breaths for the answer. It's like just pursuing that journey of questioning will no doubt come up with important answers. They might not be to the questions we were asking, but maybe they're to other questions. And so, if I could think of an experiment I could do with psychedelics to address that question, I would have already done that experiment. And right now, I don't think anyone can, but I think we should remain open to the possibility that psychedelics could be used to address the hard problem. But we need to think about it because that really seems like a difficult problem to crack.</p>

### 迷幻药疗法的未来

到目前为止，最先进的研究是使用迷幻药治疗抑郁症，以及在生命末期或严重疾病（如癌症）背景下的焦虑和抑郁，还有非医疗疾病背景下的抑郁症，以及各种形式的成瘾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The work, so far, that most advanced research, is using psychedelics in the treatment of depression and end of life or, in the context of serious illness, such as cancer, anxiety, and depression, within that context, and then depression outside of medical illness, and then a variety of forms of addiction.</p>
</details>

我或我的同事正在研究的其他疾病包括强迫症、厌食症、不同形式的成瘾，包括可卡因成瘾、酒精成瘾。我即将开始使用裸盖菇素治疗创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的工作。基于大鼠的神经可塑性研究，以及因反复头部撞击而受伤的运动员声称使用迷幻药恢复了认知能力，并帮助他们治疗抑郁和成瘾，我也有兴趣从事这方面的工作。所以，还有很多领域有待探索。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other disorders that either I'm studying or colleagues are studying are obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia, different forms of addiction, including cocaine addiction, alcohol addiction. I'm about to start work on using psilocybin to treat PTSD. And based on that rat research of neuroplasticity, of athletes that have sustained injury through repetitive head impact that are claiming that using psychedelics have restored cognitive ability, as well as doing things like helping them with depression and addiction. So I'm interested in pursuing that work. So there's just a whole lot that's out there.</p>
</details>

其中一些领域正在研究中，我们还没有结果，所以不能超前于数据。我认为研究所有这些都有很好的理由。有些可能会成功，希望如此，有些我们可能会遇到瓶颈。它可能对这个、这个和那个有好处，但对这个和那个没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So some of those areas are being researched, and we don't have results yet, and so we can't get ahead of the data. I think there's a good rationale to study all of these things. Some of them might work out, hopefully, and some of them, we might run up against a boundary. It might be good for this, this, and that, but not this and that.</p>
</details>

到目前为止，研究主要集中在18岁及以上的成年人。然而，随着研究的继续，我们需要关注更年轻的人群。事实上，这是FDA非常希望看到的。无论是迷幻药还是其他什么，如果它在成年人中看起来非常有益，那么就有必要真正探索这一点，因为青少年也患有抑郁症和成瘾等问题。

<details>
<从最大的角度来看，除了迷幻药治疗某种疾病的能力之外，我认为它们有望真正帮助我们理解精神疾病的本质。我们看到同一种干预措施对抑郁和焦虑有帮助，无论是在癌症背景下还是在癌症之外，对不止一种形式的成瘾，而是多种形式的成瘾都有帮助，这真是闻所未闻，它应该向我们大声疾呼，去寻找这些所谓的“跨诊断过程”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The research, so far, has been focused on adults that are 18 or older in most of the studies. However, as we continue the research, we're gonna need to look at younger populations. In fact, this is something that the FDA really wants. It doesn't matter whether it's psychedelics or something else. Like, if it looks really beneficial in adults, there's a mandate to really explore this because adolescents suffer from depression and addictions, etc.</p>

我的看法是，这需要额外的谨慎。这不是你开始的地方。首先，看看在成年人身上效果如何，对于发育中的大脑确实有额外的担忧，但对于未经治疗的精神疾病也有担忧，对吧？包括自杀、过量服用等等。所以，不探索这也是有风险的，但要非常非常谨慎。

<p class="english-text">The way I view it is that just an extra level of caution. That's not where you start. First, see how things work in adults, and there are extra concerns about the developing brain, but there's concerns about untreated mental illness, right? Including suicides, including overdoses, etc. So there's a risk in not exploring this, but being very, very cautious.</p>

从最大的角度来看，除了迷幻药治疗某种疾病的能力之外，我认为它们有望真正帮助我们理解精神疾病的本质。我们看到同一种干预措施对抑郁和焦虑有帮助，无论是在癌症背景下还是在癌症之外，对不止一种形式的成瘾，而是多种形式的成瘾都有帮助，这真是闻所未闻，它应该向我们大声疾呼，去寻找这些所谓的“跨诊断过程”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">In the biggest picture, aside from psychedelic's ability to treat one disorder or another, I think they're just poised to really help us to understand the nature of psychiatric disorders. I mean, the fact that we're seeing a similar, the same intervention, really, be helpful for depression and anxiety, whether it's in the context of cancer or outside of it, helping with not just one form of addiction but multiple forms of addiction, this is really unheard of, and it should be screaming to us to look for these so-called 'trans-diagnostic processes.'</p>
</details>

比如，这些不同疾病的潜在共同点是什么？它们之间有什么共同之处，以至于迷幻药治疗能够解决它们？我开始认为——也许是因为理解成瘾是我的基础——我把所有这些疾病都看作是不同形式的成瘾。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Like, what's underlying these different disorders? What commonalities do they have with each other that are somehow being addressed by psychedelic treatment? I mean, I've come to think of it- perhaps because understanding addiction is really kind of a foundation for me- I kind of think of all of these disorders as different forms of addiction.</p>
</details>

无论是对一种物质，如烟草、酒精、可卡因，还是对一种思考自己的方式，如抑郁症中的自我迫害思想，我们都有，但在抑郁症患者中过度表达，一旦你陷入其中，它就变成了自我实现的预言。一旦你花很多时间称自己为失败者，然后这会影响到其他人，你就会螺旋式下降——这就是一种成瘾。

<p class="english-text">So whether it's to a substance, like tobacco or alcohol, cocaine, or a way of thinking about yourself in depression, the self-persecutory thoughts that we all have, but that are overexpressed in someone with depression, and once you're in it, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you spend a lot of your day calling yourself a failure and then that rubs off on other people, and you spiral downward- that is an addiction.</p>
</details>

这是一种狭隘的精神和行为模式。你被限制了。现实曾经是这样的，现在你的现实是这样的。无论那是导向一种物质，还是一种特定的、次优的思考自己的方式。而迷幻药，如果在正确的环境中做得好，有能力将人们从那种狭隘的故事中彻底解放出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's this narrowed mental and behavioral repertoire. You have been narrowed. Reality used to be like this, and now your reality is like this. And wherever that's taking to a substance, or to a certain suboptimal way of thinking about yourself. And psychedelics, when done well in the right setting, have the ability to just blow people out of that narrowed story.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，从宏观上看，它在帮助我们弄清精神疾病的本质，以及如何预防这些疾病方面，拥有巨大的潜力。我们如何走向一个不仅主要关注治疗疾病的社会？而是，对于心理健康的人来说，是什么创造了健康？我们如何在精神卫生保健中进行预防性护理？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's like really big picture. It holds a lot of promise in helping us figure out what the nature of mental disorders are, and also how to prevent those disorders. How can we move towards a society where we're not just primarily focused on treating disorders? But what creates, for the psychologically healthy person, how can we have preventative care and mental health care?</p>
</details>

这真的触动了我，因为我做了很多用迷幻药治疗疾病的研究，也做了很多其他研究，我们只是治疗所谓的“健康正常人”，好像他们没有任何问题。但你猜怎么着？你给一个在准备好的环境中、处于准备好状态的人类一剂大剂量的迷幻药，天哪，那些东西，那些问题，无论你是否可被诊断，过去的创伤，各种类型的成瘾，它们都会浮出水面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it really just hits home for me because I've done lots of studies treating disorders with psychedelics and a lot of other studies where we're just treating so-called healthy normals, as if they don't have any problems. And guess what? You give a big dose of a psychedelic to a human being in a prepared setting, and boy, that stuff, those problems, whether you're diagnosable or not, that trauma from the past, those various forms of addiction of whatever type, they kind of come to the surface.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，从宏观上看，迷幻药可以帮助我们走向一个开始理解人类保持精神健康需要什么的世界。我们可以在预防精神上做些什么？也许迷幻药会在其中扮演一些角色，但也许它们也会指向其他技术，让我们能够保持健康。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I think psychedelics, big picture, can help us move towards a world where we start to understand what it takes for the human being to be mentally healthy. What can we do in the spirit of prevention? Maybe psychedelics will play some role in that, but maybe they'll also point us to other techniques that will allow us to keep ourselves healthy.</p>

一些参与者在体验后会说，一次六小时的裸盖菇素体验就像1000小时的治疗。迷幻药起作用时，似乎是因为它们更接近心理问题的根源，而不是在表面层面治疗它们，而大多数精神科药物治疗精神健康障碍的方式，更多是在表面层面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people come out of these sessions as participants and say that one six-hour experience with psilocybin is like 1,000 hours of therapy. It does seem that psychedelics, when they work, it's because they're getting closer to the roots of psychological problems rather than treating them at the surface level, which is the way most psychiatric medications will treat mental health disorders, more at the surface level.</p>
</details>

但这就是为什么到目前为止，似乎只需要在正确的环境中接触一、二、三次迷幻药，就可能足以真正治疗这些疾病。在某些情况下，它看起来更像是一种治愈，不总是这样，但我不会轻易使用这个词。但有时它看起来像是一种治愈，因为它真的看起来像是人们解决了深层的、潜在的心理问题，而这些问题以各种症状表现出来，无论是什么疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this is why it appears, so far, that it might only take one, two, or three exposures in the right setting to a psychedelic, and that may be enough to really treat these disorders. In some cases, it can appear more like a cure, not always, but I don't use that term lightly. But sometimes it looks like a cure 'cause it really looks like people have resolved deep, underlying psychological issues that are kind of manifesting these various symptoms for whatever disorder.</p>
</details>

我不知道有任何证据表明大型制药公司一直在阻挠或害怕迷幻药研究。它们传统上当然没有投资于此。我认为它们在观望。主要是小型风险投资初创公司在探索迷幻药，并投资于它们通过FDA途径的潜在发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not aware of any evidence that big pharma has been blocking or is scared of psychedelic research. They certainly traditionally haven't invested in it. I think they're sort of sitting back. It's mainly small venture capitalist start-ups that are exploring psychedelics and investing in their potential development through the FDA pathway.</p>
</details>

但这一直是精神健康药物的趋势。让小公司进行这些投资，如果它们早期取得了有希望的发现，那么大型制药公司就会进来，支付数百万美元收购这些公司，并继续推进。所以我认为它们在伺机而动，但这是一种非常不同的商业模式，你不会通过每天卖药来赚大钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's been the trend for mental health drugs for a while now. Let the small companies make these investments, and if they come up with promising findings early on, then the big pharma companies come in and pay the millions of dollars to buy those companies out and move forward with it. So I think they're waiting in the wings, but it's a very different model where you're not gonna be making a whole lot of money selling that pill on a daily basis.</p>
</details>

如果它有效，你希望一生中只卖给某人一、二、三颗药。所以更多的商业模式，将是基础设施和通过这些体验的专业指导。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hopefully, you're only selling one, two, or three pills to someone over their lifetime if it works. So more of the business model, but it would be one of the infrastructure and the professional guidance through these sessions.</p>
