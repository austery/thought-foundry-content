### 沃什的提名与初步反应

**乔 (Joe)**: 总统特朗普选择了大家都不太喜欢的候选人凯文·沃什，来担任下一任美联储主席。我向沃什致敬，他被反复错过后，终于获得了提名，这对他来说是一项了不起的成就。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: President Trump has picked everyone's least favorite candidate, Kevin Walsh, for the next Fed Reserve chief. I tip my hat to Walsh, who has managed to get selected after being passed over time and again. That's a remarkable achievement for him.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 尼尔（Neil）是本期节目的完美嘉宾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: We do have the perfect guest.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 你正在收听的是《Lots More》，我们在这里与朋友们聊聊当下发生的事情，因为即使《Odd Lots》结束了，总有更多的事情。我们确实请到了完美的嘉宾。我现在觉得有趣的是，当特朗普宣布某人时，你期望媒体上出现一群自由派的蠢货，他们会挥舞拳头，说“哦，这不好”。你知道，会有很多可预测的反应。但听到像尼尔这样的人——我并不认为他与自由派媒体的群体思维有任何关联——以及许多其他人，他们却说“嗯，这是一个有趣的任命”。我的想法是，意见确实有些分歧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: You're listening to Lots More where we catch up with friends about what's going on right now because even when Odd Lots is over, there's always lots more and we really do have the perfect guest. I'm just going to say what I find interesting right now is that you know like Trump announces someone and you expect a bunch of like liberal ninnies in the media to like shake their fists. It's like oh this isn't good. You know it's like there's a lot of predictable response. But it is interesting to my mind to hear someone like Neil who is uh I do not associate him with liberal media group think or anything like that as well as many others uh who are like huh interesting pick here. Well, I will say opinions kind of divided. So,

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 穆罕默德·阿拉兰（Mohamad Alaran）早些时候发推说，他认为凯文将是一位伟大的美联储主席，他观察到——这是引用——“在凯文此前担任美联储理事、在学术界以及作为30人集团（Group of 30）的成员期间，我曾与他有过观察和互动，我相信他带来了深厚的专业知识、广泛的经验和敏锐的沟通技巧的强大结合。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Mohamad Alaran tweeted earlier that he thinks Kevin's gonna be a great Fed chair and he's observed and this is a quote, "Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed governor in academia and as a fellow member of the group of 30, I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills." So,

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 顺便说一句，杰森·弗曼（Jason Ferman）也发推说，“凯文·沃什在实质内容和独立性方面都远超标准，足以担任美联储主席。参议院应该就他的独立性提出尖锐问题，而特朗普总统应该减少对其的威胁。”希望这能清楚地表明沃什应该得到确认。所以，双方意见不一。它并没有以显而易见、简单的方式分裂。总之，斯坎达（Skanda），近况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: by the way, Jason Ferman, too. He tweeted, "Kevin Wars is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be chair of the Federal Reserve. The Senate should ask tough questions about his independent and President Trump should reduce the threat to it." Hopefully, that will make it clear Worsh should be confirmed. So, it is a mix on both sides. It is not dividing in obvious easy ways. Anyway, Scond, what's up?

</details>

### 沃什的背景与担忧

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 很高兴能参与这个历史性的日子。这确实是一个时刻。我想我们看到了。是的，凯文·沃什目前是等待中的继任者，如果他能获得参议院的确认。有趣的是，他是那个30人集团的成员，这是一个由前央行行长、前财政部长以及各界有影响力的人物组成的团体。所以你看到了穆罕默德·阿拉兰、杰森·弗曼、乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）、马克·卡尼（Mark Carney），他们肯定不是那种“美国优先”的群体，可能更具全球主义色彩，但他们显然都支持了凯文·沃什，因为我认为他们可能与他有过多次交流，并认为他是一个非常严肃的人。我个人更倾向于我们朋友尼尔指出的观点。顺便说一句，我们当然是在与本播客的老朋友斯坎达·埃默拉斯（Scanda Emmerath）交谈，他是Employee America的联合创始人兼执行官。所以，当你看到“好吧，像尼尔这样的人，还有像你这样的人，你们都有这些顾虑，这些焦虑的根源是什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: Glad to be part of this momentous day. It is a moment. I guess we see that. Yeah, Kevin Worsh is uh right now the successor in waiting if uh he gets confirmed by the Senate. It is funny how he's part of this group of 30 which is a form of former central bankers, former finance ministers and movers and shakers. So you see Muhammad Alien, Jason Ferman, George Osborne, I believe Mark Carney, certainly not exactly the most um America first kind of uh grouping, maybe more globalist in flavor, has definitely kind of rallied around uh Kevin Worsh because I think they've probably conversed with him a bunch of times and take him to be a very serious person. I myself am much more sympathetic to what uh our friend Neil has pointed out. By the way, we are talking of course to longtime friend of the pod Scanda Emmerath, co-founder and executive of Employee America. So when you see like Okay, so someone like Neil and and someone like yourself and you have these reservations like what is the origin of some of these uh anxieties?

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 我认为有几个不同的焦虑点，我想我们先从这一点开始：他显然曾在美联储任职过，对吧？他曾是美联储的理事。所以我们有他的过往记录。我们不必依赖二手验证。而且，如果我们对凯文·沃什一无所知，我想也许值得更加强调杰森·弗曼和穆罕默德以及那些人的说法，他们看起来是受人尊敬的人，但他是美联储理事，他在公共知识分子领域留下了相当长的足迹，发表过讲话，出现在《华尔街日报》的评论版上。而问题在于，这最终会回到一个问题：在危机时刻，你希望谁在场？所以美联储在危机时期往往最重要。他曾在危机时期担任美联储理事，而且他经常吹嘘这一点，就像我们正在谈论的“伟大的金融目的”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: I think there are a few different anxieties and I think let's start with this is obviously someone who served on the Fed before, right? He was a Fed governor. So we have like a track record. We don't have to like rely on secondhand validation. And we don't have to is if if we didn't know anything about Kevin Worst, I think probably it's probably worth putting a little more emphasis on what Jason Ferman and Mohammed and those people are saying and they seem like respectable people except he was Fed Governor and he does have a pretty long body of work uh in terms of a public intellectual giving remarks being in the Wall Street Journal opinion pages. And the trouble is it kind of comes back to like who do you want in a crisis, right? So the Fed really tends to matter the most in periods of crisis. He was a Fed governor in the crisis and

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 是的，2008年金融危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: qualified purpose.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 是的。2008年金融危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yes. The the 2008 financial crisis.

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 如果你回顾他整个时期的观点，你会发现，这个人非常热衷于宣扬金融体系的表现良好，即使它在2007年和8年正滑向危机。他非常热衷于在2008年夏秋季，直到雷曼兄弟倒闭，真正地强调通胀的重要性。所以，这显然是一个当时他看错了重点的人。好吧，错误是会发生的，人们有不同的看法。我不认为我们应该对此过于苛刻。然而，就在2009年到来之际，我们姑且认为金融困境最糟糕的时期可能已经过去，但我们面临的是历史上高企且不断上升的失业率。他基本上说，这并不是一个真正大问题，不是美联储应该关注的事情，而且我们实际上应该开始重新关注维持较低的利率，而不是那么低。我担心通胀。所以他提出了很多理由，解释为什么他认为通胀会爆发，为什么量化宽松（QE）非常糟糕，以及这最终会导致首先是通胀，然后可能是某种形式的资产价格膨胀，可能是泡沫，可能是变相的财政政策。他提出了很多不同的理由，在不同时间点，解释为什么他非常不喜欢美联储资产负债表如此庞大。但首先，那些预测并没有真正实现。我认为它们反映了对美联储资产负债表实际作用和本质的误解。而这仍然是他的一大“爱好”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: If you go through what his views were through that whole period, what you will find is this is someone who was very eager to tout the financial system was performing even as it was descending into crisis in 2007 and 8. He was very eager to really upweight the importance of inflation in the summer and fall of 2008 until Lehman failed. So this is someone clearly who had his eye on I'd say the wrong ball at that time. Okay, mistakes happen like people had different views. I don't think we should be like too precious about that specifically. And yet also the moment that sort of we came into 2009 and let's say the absolute worst of the financial distress may have been behind us but we had historically high and rising unemployment. He basically said this was not really a big problem, not something the Fed should be focused on and that we actually should start to shift back towards focusing on keeping uh interest rates more normal, not so low. I'm worried about inflation. And so he came up with a lot of reasons why he thought inflation was going to explode, why QE was really bad, and that that would ultimately lead to first inflation, then maybe some version of asset price inflation, maybe bubbles, maybe it's backdoor fiscal policy. He came with a lot of different reasons at different times for why he really hated the fact that the Fed's balance sheet was so big. But one, those predictions weren't really true. I think they reflect a misunderstanding of what the Fed's balance sheet really does and is. And it's still like a big um it's a is a favorite hobby horse of his.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 但这本身就像，他某种程度上错过了整个金融危机，对吧？除了最糟糕的时期，2008年10月大家就达成了一致。但这并不是一个值得夸耀的功绩，你实际上是想明白了你必须支持金融体系。我认为这是第一个令人担忧的方面。但假设，好吧，人们经历过各种事件，错过了很多事情，你会希望他们从中吸取教训，表现出一些谦逊，比如“我错过了这个问题的这一部分，它的规模，它的持续时间，下次我会做得更好”。我们并没有真正听到这些。但好吧，我们先搁置那些“错过的东西”。然而，从那之后，还有两件事更令人担忧：我们现在看到一种日益增长的模式，即他在宏观和货币政策观点上的“谄媚”和“党派性”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: But that itself is like he kind of missed the whole financial crisis in a way, right? Like aside from like the absolute worst of it, everyone got on the same page in October 2008. But that's like kind of like not like that's not a great badge of like um of of honor that you actually figured out that you had to sort of support the financial system at that time. I think that's the first dimension that probably is of concern. But let's say like okay people have gone through various episodes and missed a lot of things and you'd hope coming out of that people kind of have learned something expressed some humility okay I missed this part of this problem the scale of it the duration of it and I'll do better next time. We haven't really heard that. But okay, let's leave those like missing mialas aside. The two things that are more concerning that come out of that though

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 是我们现在看到一种日益增长的模式，即他在宏观和货币政策观点上的“谄媚”和“党派性”。所以，让我们快进到2024年，对吧？我们曾有一段时间，显然有一种感觉，即美联储将降息，但他们会足够快地降息吗？还是会等待更长时间，因为他们希望看到通胀取得更多进展。凯文·沃什在这一年的大部分时间里，他很明显属于那种认为美联储冒着风险，没有足够长地维持高利率来抑制通胀的阵营。但你认为他的政策观点是什么时候改变的？它们恰好在2024年11月基本改变了，他基本上对那些可能被认为是相当强硬的观点来了个180度大转弯，但实际上，它们在选举结果出来的那一刻就变成了鸽派。现在，显然，每个人都会在一定程度上将他们的政策观点与政治和党派性联系起来，无论他们是否愿意。这里不能说没有人幸免，但如果你回顾他的记录，你会发现一种倾向，即在民主党执政期间，他基本上担心通胀和财政过度支出，然后当共和党执政时，他倾向于转向放松管制和生产力增长，这些将是通缩性的，这就是为什么我们可以在共和党执政时维持较低的利率。我认为这一点在过去18到24个月里被进一步放大了，你看到了那种180度的转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: is we see now a growing pattern of both obsequiousness and partisanship in how he orients his macro and monetary policy views. So let's let's fast forward to 2024, right? where we had for a while obviously there was a sense of like the Fed's going to cut rates but are they going to cut rates soon enough or are they going to wait longer because they want to see more progress on inflation. Kevin Worsh for most of that year he was pretty clearly in the camp of the Fed is risking not keeping interest rates high enough for long enough to kill inflation. But when do you think that his policy views changed? they happen to change in November 2024 basically and he basically did a big 180 on what were probably considered pretty hawkish views but actually they turned doubbish the moment the election changes now obviously like everyone does a version of inflcting their policy views with some level of politics and partisanship whether they can help it or not here to say it's like any anyone's immune but there's a tendency if you look through his track record of basically worrying about inflation and worrying about sort of fiscal excesses is during periods when it's a Democrat that that's in the White House and then it tends to flip towards deregulation and productivity growth that are going to be disinflationary and that's that's why we can afford to keep rates lower when it's a Republican that's in the White House. I think that's been dialed up even further in this this this last call it 18 to 24 months [snorts] where you've seen that sort of 180 take place.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 是的。而且我认为这恰恰说明了他为了得到这份工作，向特朗普总统承诺了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. And I think that kind of speaks to exactly what did he have to promise to President Trump to get the job.

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 你提到在《华尔街日报》上写社论，这很有趣。这也是一条老路。他说，在他任职美联储期间的这些年里，他所做的就是批评量化宽松和美联储本身，一路上做出了很多错误的经济判断，并且每年都在《华尔街日报》上写同样的社论。所以，我读了一些那些社论，但我也读了他去年发表的一篇演讲，他在批评美联储过于依赖数据，过于关注短期预测。这让我想，好吧，如果你不看数据，你还能看什么呢？我们是否能了解他实际在制定政策时优先考虑什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: It's funny you mentioned uh writing op-eds in the Wall Street Journal. And this is also a da line. He says and all he's done in the years since his time at the Fed is critique QE and the Fed itself, making a bunch of bad economic calls along the way and writing the same op-ed in the Wall Street Journal every year. So, one thing I was reading, you know, I read some of those op-eds, but I also read a speech that Worsh made last year, and he was criticizing the Fed for being too dependent on data or focusing on data dependency, too much near-term forecasting. And it kind of, you know, it made me think like, well, if you're not looking at the data, what are you going to be looking at? Do we have any sense of what he actually prioritizes when it comes to making policy?

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 是的，我的意思是，也许是凭感觉，也许是总统的偏好，但显然，这有点像在开玩笑。但我想，如果我们没有数据，我们还能有什么呢？对吧？如果我们没有一种可以谈论事实的语言，我们还能有什么呢？显然数据有缺陷？我们都知道宏观经济数据发布有局限性，各种信息点能告诉我们的东西有限。我们都在试图围绕宏观经济这个模糊的现实进行推断。但它是一种有用的语言，能够让不同政策偏好、不同政治立场的人达成某种共识，对吧？这是一种说法：“好吧，这是关于数据的一个事实。我们可以说这是它过高、过低、偏向于此的原因。你可以对此进行讨论，但至少这是一种确保我们讨论的不是政治，不是美联储职权范围之外的政策的方式。我认为你从凯文·沃什那里听到的关于数据依赖的说法相当令人担忧，因为它有点表明他不在乎被视为客观。他对实际做一些能扩大美联联合法定基础的事情缺乏兴趣，这样人们就会理解，‘好吧，美联储之所以做出这个决定，是因为指标朝着这个方向移动，或者他们认为指标正在朝着这个方向移动。’与此同时，你显然面临着一种情况，即当特朗普一直在说他想要他的人来做[笑声]他想做的事，并且他真的对选择杰罗姆·鲍威尔感到失望时，侵蚀美联储信任的风险就很大。所以基本上，杰罗姆·鲍威尔不够顺从特朗普的要求。我认为这只会增加未来的风险。而且，我只是想把话题拉回到危机问题上，美联储在危机和分裂政府时期一直是如此重要的参与者，对吧？当我们想到2008年和2020年，当白宫由共和党控制，而国会却存在相当激烈的反对时，2020年是民主党控制的众议院，2008年是两院都由民主党控制。你如何制定出能够开始应对眼前危机的政策？你之所以能做到这一点，是因为存在一些共识和信任，即美联储可以成为一个可靠的危机协调者。我认为这次会困难得多，因为凯文·莫里斯的记录显然存在某种程度的谄媚，这从他如何进行这些政策180度转变中非常明显。他有时会从鹰派转变为鸽派，然后特朗普一上任，他就开始转向更鸽派。他在2017年也做过类似的事情，虽然没那么夸张。所以，这是令人担忧的事情。再加上他担任美联储理事期间，发表了大量演讲，他在其中谈论了很多超出常规范围的事情。他不仅仅谈论货币政策或金融监管。他开始提出一些更广泛的担忧，比如‘嘿，我不喜欢奥巴马政府的贸易政策。我不喜欢我们在更广泛的监管政策上可能走错方向’——这些事情本不应由他来关注，但他却涉足了政治领域，并且当时可能是在对一个更具党派性的听众讲话。我认为自2005-2006年以来你所看到的一切都表明，他想与党派中的一方对话，但在危机时刻，当你需要跨越党派的合作关系时，情况可能大不相同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: Yeah, I mean maybe it's vibes, maybe it's presidential preferences, but obviously like sort of halfkitting there, but I think it's like what do we have if we don't have data, right? What do we have if we don't have a language that you can talk about facts like obviously data has flaws? We all know that there's like limitations to what macroeconomic data releases can tell us, what various points of information tell us. We're all trying to triangulate around this like fuzzy reality of macroeconomics. But it's a useful language for being able to like get people from different policy preferences, different political orientations to get on something of the same page, right? It's a way of saying, okay, this is a fact about the data. We can tell say this is the reason why it's too high, it's too low, it's biased this way. You can have a discussion about it, but at least it's a way to make sure we're talking about something other than politics, something other than policy that's like outside of the ambit of the Fed. I think what you actually hear from Kevin War on the data dependent side is pretty worrisome because it kind of speaks to a a disinterest in in being perceived as objective. A lack of interest in actually doing something that can broaden legitimacy around the Fed so that people will understand okay the Fed made this decision because indicators moved in this direction or they think indicators are moving this direction. At the same time, you obviously have a situation where like there's a lot of risk of eroding trust in the Fed when Trump has been saying that he wants his guy in who's going to do [laughter] what he wants and that he really felt burned by picking Jerome Powell. So basically that Jerome Powell was not pliant enough to what Trump was looking for. I think that that just raises a lot of risks going forward. And I just to bring it back to the issue of crisis, the Fed has been such an important actor in periods of crisis and divided government, right? When we think about 2008 and 2020 when periods when the White House was controlled by a Republican and there was a pretty viciferous opposition from Congress in terms of obviously there was a Democratic House in 2020 and both chambers were a Democratic in 2008. How did you get to like policies that actually started to take out like address the scale of the crisis in front of them? You got there because there was some agreement and trust that the Fed could be a reliable kind of crisis broker of sorts. I think that's going to be a lot harder this time around because Kevin Morris's like track record obviously there's a certain obsequiousness that kind of has been very obvious from how he's done these policy 180s. He goes from hawk at one point and then the moment Trump wins office he starts to shift towards being more doubbish. He did a version of this in 2017 though less exaggerated. So that's something that like is concerning. Layer it on to his tenure as Fed governor has this like features a lot of speeches in which he's like really going off script in terms of what he's talking about. He doesn't just talk about monetary policy or just financial regulation. He started to give kind of these like bigger concerns about hey I don't really like the way the trade policy is going under the Obama administration. I don't really like how like we risk going down the wrong path on broader regulatory policy things that really shouldn't have been under his domain itself to focus on and yet he kind of veered into the political and probably was speaking to a more partisan audience at that time. I think everything you've seen since 20056 kind of speaks to someone who wants to talk to one side of the partisan aisle, but it may be very different in a crisis when you need relationships across the spectrum.

</details>

### 沃什的精英圈背景与潜在影响

**乔 (Joe)**: 你知道，无论人们对伯南克（Bernanke）还是鲍威尔（Paul）等人有什么看法，他们两人，你知道，在两党之间都得到了相当程度的尊重，这在危机期间可能非常有帮助。我有一个问题。我一直不太清楚答案，但即使回到2009年、2010年等时期。很多人真的很喜欢沃什，你提到他身处一个精英圈子，都是一些非常重要的重量级人物等等。而且，如果我没记错的话，伯南克也很喜欢沃什。他是如何进入这些精英货币政策圈子的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: You know, regardless of what people thought about Bernanki or Paul, etc., both of them, you know, were reasonably well respected across both sides of the aisle, which probably was very helpful during the crisis. I have a question. I've never actually quite known the answer to this, but even going back to 2009, 2010, etc. Like a lot of people really liked Worsh, and you mentioned that he's in a select community of like some pretty like heavy hitters, etc. And I think uh Bernani liked Worsh quite a bit if I recall. what is the sort of like war origin story of like how he got to be in the circles of some of the most elite you know monetary policy minds.

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 他是当时被选为美联储理事的最年轻的人之一，而且当时关于他是否合格就引起了很多争议。有一些很好的背景资料显示，有很多批评者，包括前美联储副主席、曾在罗纳德·里根手下任职的人都表达了保留意见。这是关于选择了一个如此年轻、没有真正业绩记录的人。他曾在摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）的投资银行工作，并在科技、媒体、电信领域短暂任职。他在这些圈子里出名，主要是……我不知道该归功于多少。我不是，但我确实认为，他的岳父是共和党的主要捐助者之一，并且一直是特朗普的重要捐助者，这一点很重要。所以，罗恩·劳德（Ron Lauder），来自雅诗兰黛（Estee Lauder）家族。所以，某些层面的关系确实起到了作用。我认为兰迪·夸尔斯（Randy Quarles）——他是特朗普第一任期任命的监管主管——和凯文·沃什之间，在布什政府财政部秘书办公室的一个特定职位上，有过一场相当有据可查的斗争。所以，他一直在那些圈子里。我认为他主要是与那些……我们称之为那些人，他曾是胡佛研究所（Hoover Institution）的访问学者，这是一个显而易见的保守派经济思想的智囊团，但他主要也是在与特定人群对话，比如《华尔街日报》的社论版主要与他持相同观点的人。他成功地进行了转型，确保他的声音能被特朗普总统很好地听到。所以，他以一种也许其他人未能做到的方式完成了这种转变。但这种转型本身一直是以“我真的在对共和党听众讲话”为导向的。我对此的疑问是，如果我们遇到任何需要美联储出面救火的情况，或者需要某个机构扮演那个角色——就像在2008年的银行救助计划（TARP）或其他类似救助中那样——你如何能做到这一点？当这个人一直以某种方式相当坚定地党派化和意识形态化时。意识形态化也许在不是特朗普执政的时候更明显，但这确实很难让人信任。我们对此习以为常，在宏观经济和金融领域，我们认为美联储应该在危机时介入，但美联储在危机时介入的前提是获得国会和白宫的支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: So he was one of the youngest people selected to be uh a Fed governor and there was a lot of consternation even about whether he was qualified at that time. There's some some good background about how there were a lot of critics, former Fed Vice chairman, people who served under Ronald Reagan expressing reservation. It's about picking someone so young who was had no real track record. He was like an investment bank at Morgan Stanley and technology media telecom for a brief period. He's kind of known in these circles primaril like I don't I don't know how much to ascribe to this. I'm not, but I do think like it matters that probably his father-in-law is one of the big donors to the Republican party and has been a big donor to Trump. So Ron Laauair of Estee Lauder fame. So there's like certain levels of connections that have mattered. I think there's pretty well doumented fight between Randy Quarl who was the head of supervision appointed by Trump in his first term and uh Kevin Worsh were fighting over a particular job in the Bush Treasury Secretary office, the Treasury Department. So he's been around Yeah. in those circles. I think he's mostly been conversed with let's call people who are like he was a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution which is like an intellectual hub for obviously conservative economic thought but he's also mostly been speaking to a specific crowd like the Wall Street Journal oped page has mostly been with those who are of his persuasion. He has managed to do a remarkable job of shapeshifting towards making sure he's heard well by President Trump. And so he has managed to kind of make that transition in a way that maybe other people have not. But that shape-shifting itself has always been with an orientation towards I'm really speaking to a Republican audience. And I what I wonder about that is if we run into any sort of situation where you're going to need the Fed to kind of put out a fire or you're going to need some institution to do that play that role as it was the case in the car's act or was the case around TARP or around uh any of the other sort of bailouts of 2008. How do you like muster that together when like this person has kind of been pretty consistently partisan and ideological in some ways? Ideological maybe more so when it's not Trump at the helm, but it's just something that becomes very hard to trust. And we kind of take that for granted in terms of like macro and finance about how the Fed is supposed to step in when there's a crisis, but like the Fed steps in in the crisis when they get the backing from both Congress and the White House

</details>

**乔 (Joe)**: 那可能不存在。我们回到沃什之前说过的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: that may not exist. Just going back to things that Warsh has said previously.

</details>

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 所以我们谈到了他对美联储的资产负债表、扩大的资产负债表和量化宽松等持非常批评的态度。假设他能在美联储找到一种方式来实现他的目标，并设法获得美联储理事会或董事会其他成员的支持，或者做些其他事情，那么他在美联储的任期在货币政策方面会有多大的戏剧性？因为我在想，你知道，一直有一些讨论或暗示，沃什希望彻底改革货币政策和利率的实施方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: So we talked about he's been very critical of the Fed's balance sheet, expanded balance sheet and QE and things like that. Assuming that he figures out a way to do what he wants at the Fed and somehow gets support of the Fed board or does something else, how dramatic could his tenure at the Fed actually be in terms of monetary policy? cuz I'm thinking, you know, there's been some chat or some suggestion that Worsh would like to radically redesign the way monetary policy interest rates are actually implemented.

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 是的，这对我来说一直有点模糊，因为他一直非常热衷于批评，但批评的性质总是不得不……不断适应我称之为“某种程度上失败的预测”。首先，很多人说量化宽松会增加货币供应量并机械地增加通胀。这是人们在2009-2010年说的，但并没有完全实现。然后，人们有点说，这将导致资产价格膨胀/泡沫。也许有资产价格膨胀，但并没有真正出现明显的泡沫。然后，一些批评转向了，好吧，它实际上对财政政策产生了影响。所以，我认为你必须从职业生涯的角度来看待你实际认为美联储资产负债表的作用。比如，如果问我，普通的、标准的国债量化宽松并没有真正做什么。它主要是两种无风险资产的资产互换，这实际上是胡佛研究所的另一位人士约翰·科克伦（John Cochran）可能会赞同的观点。所以，并没有人们所说的那些扭曲效应，但他却把它变成了一个大麻烦，认为这是需要改变的。这来得非常不合时宜，因为我们看到的是，货币市场一直在发出信号，表明实际上资产负债表正在变得……如果从这里开始缩减，并且缩减得太突然，你可能会遇到更多类似2019年9月我们看到的混乱。所以，我们可能会陷入一种情况，即回购利率飙升，因为相对于银行体系和金融体系的需求，流动性不足。你需要有一些流动性可用，而这个流动性的数量比金融危机之前要多得多。这可能是一部分监管，一部分监督，一部分银行风险管理实践。但这些东西很难确定各自的比例。所以，他把这变成了他的一个大担忧。我怀疑他可能不得不吞下苦果，并对在此期间的渐进式资产负债表扩张持更支持的态度，因为货币市场状况基本上表明，如果从美联储基金利率或货币市场利率相对于美联储支付的准备金利率或美联储为货币市场基金支付的逆回购便利利率来看，情况已经收紧了很多。那些一直在收敛，对吧？那些基本上……那些货币市场利率相对于美联储设定的利率一直在上升，这某种程度上也表明，是的，你将不得不拥有更多的灵活性，而且这并非总是如此，比如“哦天哪，这个美联储资产负债表是个大问题”，或者说，如果你缩减资产负债表，就能获得较低的利率。嗯，这些观点都有点不连贯，但我认为，尤其是现在他可能处于一个必须处理这些严峻现实的职位上，我怀疑他的观点可能会被迫改变。我们将拭目以待。让我们来谈谈，你知道，我们知道特朗普想要较低的利率。凯文·沃什刚刚说过我们需要较低的利率。所以在这方面存在一致性。其他候选人，那些进入了最后几轮的，也在谈论这一点。所以，克里斯托弗·沃勒（Christopher Waller），我认为你知道，很多人可能会说，他拥有过去五年中最好的记录，他正确地识别了通胀的转折点，并且也认识到通胀转折点何时结束。他也想要较低的利率。所以，无论谁来，大概都会有这种“现在就要降息”的观点。

**Skanda Amarnath**: Yeah, that's always been a bit fuzzy to me because he's been very eager to criticize, but the nature of the criticism has always had to like continuously adapt to what I'd call somewhat failed predictions. First, it was that there were a lot of people who said QE is going to increase the money supply and mechanically increase inflation. And that was the case that people said this in like 2009 10 didn't quite pan out that way. Then people kind of said like this going to lead to asset price inflation/bubbles like maybe there was asset price inflation but there wasn't really like an obvious bubble that transpired from it. And then it sort of that some of the criticisms shifted towards well it's actually doing something on fiscal policy. So I think you have to have a career in view of what you actually think the Fed balance sheet does. Like if you ask me ordinary vanilla Treasury QE is not really doing much. It's mostly an asset swap of two risk-free assets which is a view actually that another person at Hoover institution John Cochran would probably abide by. So there's not really any distorting effects that people are really the way people are saying and yet he sort of has made this a big bug bear that this is like the big thing that needs to shift. It comes at a very awkward time because what's been happening is that money markets have been basically giving the signal that actually the balance sheet is getting to a place where if you try to run it down from here and run it down too abruptly, you might get more dysfunction kind of similar to what we saw in like September 2019. So we might get into a situation where repo rates spike because there's just not a lot of relative to the the banking system and the financial systems needs. you do need to have some amount of liquidity available and that amount of liquidity is meaningfully more than it was prior to the financial crisis. That's probably like one part regulation, one part supervision, and one part bank risk management practices. But this stuff is kind of like actually hard to pin down how much of each. And so he's he's made this his like big concern. I suspect he's probably going to have to swallow his pride a bit and be more supportive of like gradual balance sheet expansion during this period because money market conditions are basically signaling that things have tightened up quite a bit in terms of if you look at where the Fed funds rate or money market interest rates are relative to the interest that the Fed pays on reserves or the interest rate that the Fed um pays for money market funds to the reverse repo facility. Those have been converging, right? those are basically been those those money market interest rates have been kept going up relative to those rates set by the Fed and that kind of is also a sign that like yeah you're going to have to have more malleability and it's not exactly the case that like oh my god this Fed balance sheet is like this big problem or that it's it's something that if you if you lower the balance sheet that's how you get lower interest [clears throat] rates. Um these views are all kind of incoherent but I think that especially now that he might be in a position where he has to deal with those hard realities I suspect his views may be forced to change. It'll be interesting to see what happens. Let's just talk, you know, so we know Trump wants lower rates. Kevin Wars just talked about we need lower rates. So there's alignment there. Other candidates who were like the sort of finalists also talking about that. So Christopher Waller who I think you know many people would say perhaps has the best track record of the last 5 years of anyone having correctly identified the inflationary turn and then also recognizing when the inflationary turn was coming to an end. He also wants lower rates. So like there presumably no matter who was going to come in was going to have this lower rates now view.

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 话虽如此，你知道，实际执行较低利率，在短期内，排除危机情况，这是否会改变动态，当他只是众多投票成员之一时，如果这个信息来自凯文·沃什，而不是来自克里斯托弗·沃勒呢？我认为这肯定很重要，因为至少以克里斯·沃勒为例，老实说，在所有热门候选人中，除了沃什，我都能举出一个具体的例子，说明那个人在特朗普不在任时，甚至在特朗普不叫嚣要降低利率时，都曾支持过降息。以凯文·哈塞特（Kevin Hassett）为例，他曾公开表示，我认为是在2024年10月，基本上为9月份美联储降息50个基点辩护，当时凯文·沃什、斯科特·贝桑特（Scott Bessant）和史蒂夫·迈因（Steve Myin）等人对美联储可能降息的想法大加挞伐，认为这是最具政治动机的决定。所以，你会看到一些人已经预先注册了自己的观点，并且能够做出独立于总统背景的判断，他们会带来更多的信誉。因为最终，正如你所指出的，联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）由七名美联储理事和一系列地区联储主席组成。他们不仅仅是总统任命的，当然也不是现任总统任命的，甚至那些被前任总统任命的人——我认为在很大程度上，我指的是米歇尔·鲍曼（Michelle Bowman）、克里斯·沃勒或杰伊·鲍威尔（Jay Powell）——都表现出了独立判断和评估的能力。像凯文·沃什这样的人能否争取到更多人支持，将是一个真正的挑战，对吧？他能有说服力吗？他能有说服力吗？尤其如果他是一个不太重视数据的人。就像，你可以有说服力的一种好方法是指出一个指标，然后说，“我认为这会这样发生。”如果它确实这样发生了，你在下次会议上就会获得更多信誉，说，“事情正朝着我预期的方向发展，因此我们真的需要采取我认为正确的政策方向。”就像，数据就是这样帮助人们在讨论中保持问责制的。不总是如此，但它总比什么都没有好，或者比替代方案好。所以，我认为无论谁将成为美联储主席，都会存在一种说服力的约束。我们从最高法院看到，特朗普不能随意解雇他想要解雇的所有美联储官员。至少，我们得到的是这样的迹象。所以你将不得不与已经在美联储、在FOMC工作的人合作。如果是这样，那么说服力就很重要。你表达这个观点的原因是什么？你是相信它而表达，还是因为你认为它满足了总统的要求？不幸的是，在过去大约二十年里，凯文·沃什的观点似乎与政治有着强烈的关联。你看，我认为每个人的观点都有一些政治关联，但他的更占主导地位，尤其是如果他没有提出主要基于数据的论点，我认为他可能会发现更难说服他的同事，并且会对他的真正意图产生高度怀疑。

**Skanda Amarnath**: That being said, you know, does the actual execution of lower rates in the short term setting aside crisis, does it change at all the dynamics when he's just one of multiple voting members if that message is coming from Kevin Walsh versus if it were coming from a Christopher Waller? I think it definitely matters because at least with Chris Waller, honestly with all of the front runners outside of Borch, I can point to a tangible example where that person supported the case for lower interest rates outside of a very Trumpinflected electoral context. And I'm including even Kevin Hasset here. So Rick Reer, Chris Waller are people who have made the case for rate cuts at various times even when Trump was not in office. even when Trump wasn't clamoring for lower interest rates. In the case of Kevin Hasset, he went on the record in October 2024, I believe, basically defending the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut in September, back when Kevin Worsh and Scott Bessant and Steve Steve Myin were up in arms about the idea that the Fed could cut rates and thought it was the most like politically motivated decision ever. So you get like people who have actually pre-registered their views and are not can show an ability to make judgments outside of that sort of presidential context will come with more credibility because in the end as as you rightly point out the FOMC which is made up of seven Fed governors and a set of regional Fed presidents. They are not just presidential appointees certainly not of this current president and even those who were appointed by the president in the previous administration. I think to a large extent I'm talking about Michelle Bowman or Chris Waller or Jay Powell have shown like a capacity for independent judgment and assessment. Will someone like Kevin Wars be able to bring more people on board is going to be a real challenge, right? Can he be persuasive? Can he be persuasive? And especially if he's someone who doesn't really take a lot of stock in data. Like one of the nice ways that you can be persuasive is being able to point to an indicator and saying, "I think this is going to happen in this way." And if it does happen this way, you get more credibility in the next meeting to say, I've things are going the way I suspected and therefore we really need to make take policy in the direction I think is right. Like that's kind of the data has a way of like helping keep people accountable in discussions. Not always, but like it's it's better than nothing at all or better than the the substitute. And so I think regardless of who was going to be the Fed chair, there was going to be a persuasive constraint. We're kind of seeing from the Supreme Court that Trump can't just fire everyone on the Fed that he wants. At least that's those are the tea leaves we're getting. And so you're gonna have to work with the people who are already on the Fed on the FOMC. And if that's the case, like persuasive power matters. And like what's the reason you're really like expressing this view? Are you expressing this view because you believe it or because you think it satisfies what the president wants? Unfortunately, over the course of the last, I'd say two decades, Kevin Worsh's views kind of have like a strong like political correlation to them. Look, everyone's got some political correlation in their views, I suspect, but uh his more predominantly, and especially if he wasn't making arguments rooted primarily in data, I think he may find it harder to persuade his fellow colleagues and there will be a high level suspicion about just how what exactly are the true intentions behind his agenda.

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 回到沃什去年发表的演讲，他谈到了美联储需要“政权更迭”，并说这会涉及“打破一些头”。所以，我想第一次FOMC会议可能会有点尴尬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Skanda Amarnath**: Just going back to the speech that Worsh made last year, he talked about the need for regime change at the Fed and he said that would involve quote breaking some heads. So I imagine the first uh FOMC meeting might be a little a little awkward.

**乔 (Joe)**: 他得进来，第一句话就说：“伙计们，我不是那个意思。”[笑声] 就像，如果他试图……你知道，他得进来，然后说：“我写了那个，但我不希望你们认为我是字面意思。”他得赶紧说出来。斯坎达，如果你在那次会议上，你会问沃什先生的第一个问题是什么？

<details>

**Joe**: He's got to come in and the first thing he says is he's like, "Guys, I didn't mean that literally." [laughter] Like if he's like try, you know, he's got he's got to come in and say, "I wrote that, but I don't want you guys to mean I said it literally." He's got to say that real quickly. Scanda, if you were at that meeting, what would be the one question or the first question that you asked Mr. Walsh?

### 对沃什政策立场的质疑

**斯坎达·阿姆纳思 (Skanda Amarnath)**: 哦，我想，我想，我想，这会很好，能大致了解一下他现在对利率应该在哪里有何看法，因为我认为他没有完全……他谈论了很多关于美联储政策的抽象概念，需要政权更迭，需要改革，需要更多信誉，更少的授权，或者类似的东西。这些都有些模糊，听起来好像很有实质，但我认为有点缺乏实质，因为它最终模糊了他对当前宏观经济的看法。比如，目前的通胀比美联储的目标高出约一个百分点。现在，这可能是暂时的冻结，也可能是更持久的冻结。了解他认为会发生什么，为什么会发生，会很有帮助。我们对此知之甚少，除了认为，“好吧，这个人可能会支持降息，因为他从特朗普那里得到了这份工作。”目前的理由似乎非常牵强。我认为有充分的理由持鸽派态度，也许有充分的理由持鹰派态度，但他能像FOMC成员或美联储工作人员那样识别出这些吗？就像，我们实际上……这里更像是一个黑箱，因为也许你可以自己讲一个故事，说他实际上是一个非常鹰派的人，尤其是在2009年和2010年，以及他后来在《华尔街日报》上的一些专栏文章。但尤其是自从特朗普上任以来，他的观点明显转向了更鸽派，你只是想知道，他对什么给予了高度重视，以及这是否是值得信赖的。最终，他将不得不弄清楚如何在委员会中建立更多的说服力和信任，才能成为一个有效的主席。我认为这还有待观察。斯坎达，我们要让你走了，但这不会是我们最后一次和你以及许多其他人谈论凯文·沃什。所以，感谢你的时间。

**Skanda Amarnath**: Oh, I I I think it's it would be good to get a sense of just like what he's uh what he even thinks about where interest rates should be right now because I think part of what he doesn't quite he talks a lot about Fed policy in the abstract, the need for regime change, we need reform, this need more credibility, more fewer mandates or something along those lines. It's all kind of vague and can kind of sound substantive, but I kind of think is a little substance free because it ends up blurring exactly what he thinks about the macro economy right now. Like inflation right now is about a percentage point above the Fed's target. Now, that might be freezes that are temporary. That might be freezes that are more persistent. It'd be good to understand like what what he thinks will happen. Why? I we don't really know much about that beyond just thinking like, okay, this person's probably going to be for lowering rates because he got the job from Trump. The reasoning seems very light at this point. I think it's uh there's good reason to be doubish, there's maybe good reasons to be hawkish, but can he identify those like as a someone who would be on the FOMC or a fed staffer? Like this we're actually there's more of a black box here because maybe you could have told yourself a story of how he was actually a very hawkish person, especially in 2009 and 2010 and some of his Wall Street Journal columns afterwards. But especially ever since we've had Trump in office, like his views have definitely shifted more doubbishly and you just want wonder like how much what what is he putting a high weight on and if that's something that can be trusted. Ultimately, he's going to have to figure out how to build up more persuasive power and trust among the committee to actually be an effective head chair. I think it'll be remains to be seen. Scander, we're going to let you go, but uh this is not going to be the last time we talk about Kevin Wars with you and many others. So, I appreciate your time.
