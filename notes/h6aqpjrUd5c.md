title: 早期阶段也应亲力亲为 | Reducto, Adit Abraham
---

### 早期阶段也应亲力亲为

在早期阶段，Reducto 团队做了大量手动且不 sexy 的工作。他们尝试雇佣初始的数据标注团队，但准确率不够高，所以 Adit Abraham 自己花了很多时间标注文档。如果把 Reducto 处理的页面堆叠起来，高度将是珠穆朗玛峰的 10 倍。

这些工作虽然重复、枯燥，但对 Adit 来说不是问题，因为他关注的是公司是否在进步。他认为，能为客户提供服务是一种特权。

Reducto 是一家为 AI 团队提供数据解析、提取和编辑服务的平台。公司发展非常迅速，已经从投资者那里筹集了 1.08 亿美元的资金。Reducto 的客户包括许多大型企业和领先的 AI 公司，如 Harvey、Rogo 和 Meror。

### 紧密的客户合作

Adit 从小就有一些副业，高中时看到 Flappy Birds 的创作者每天从广告收入中赚 5 万美元，他和朋友就决定放弃学业，开发自己的应用。虽然最终他们选择了继续上大学，但这段经历让他意识到，个人的努力可以带来意想不到的成果。

Reducto 的成功也源于与客户的紧密合作。Adit 记得，在早期阶段，他们会为每个客户建立独立的 Slack 频道，并直接分享联系方式，以便及时解决问题。

### 建立信任

Reducto 的成长也离不开投资者的支持。Adit 认为，选择投资者时，最重要的是看个人合伙人是否愿意在未来 10 年与公司共同发展。

他回忆起一次经历，Reducto 的种子投资者 Liz 在自己休假时，仍紧急处理公司问题。她联系了她的网络，并迅速找到公司的高级产品总监来帮助解决问题。这让 Adit 深刻体会到，好的投资者会全心全意地帮助公司成功。

### 未来愿景

Adit 认为，Reducto 不仅仅是数据解析，更是连接人类数据和新一代智能的桥梁。他看到，越来越多的产品不仅能读取文档，还能为客户创建新的文档，并与智能工作流相结合。

在未来，AI 产品将融入更多智能组件，而 Reducto 希望成为与这些智能组件交互的最佳方式。

We
did
a
ton
of
manual
unsexy
[music]

work
in
the
early
days.
Like
we
tried

hiring
an
initial
data
labeling
team
and

they
weren't
accurate
enough.
So
I
would

spend
a
lot
of
my
time
just
labeling

boxes
on
documents.
If
you
stacked

all
the
pages
that
reduced
processed,
it

would
actually
be
something
like
10

times
the
height
of
Mount
Everest

back
when
we
were
still
like
fully

unautomated
for
Stripe
billing
and

setup.
Like
I
would
manually
set
up

every
single
subscription.
And
those

things,
even
though
[music]
they
were

repetitive,
even
though
they
were
maybe

boring
in
terms
of
the
work
that
you're

doing,
were
okay
because
the
thing
that

I
cared
about
is
not
like
am
I
doing

the
most
glamorous
work.
It
was
more
so
like

[music]
is
the
company
moving
forward?

You're
lucky
to
be
able
to
do
that

because
that
means
you're
signing
up
a

new
customer.
Like
it
is
a
privilege

that
you
get
to
do
that.
Hi,
my
name
is

Ad
Abraham.
I'm
the
co-founder
and
CEO

of
Reductto.
Reductto
is
a
platform
that

helps
AI
teams
parse,
extract,
and
edit

any
sort
of
complex
unstructured
data

for
all
sorts
of
language
model
use
cases.

Reduct
has
grown
incredibly
quickly.
We've
raised
108
million
in

total
funding
from
incredible
investors

like
Andre
and
Horowits,
Benchmark,
and

First
Round.
Today,
Reductive
powers

ingestion
for
some
of
the
best
companies

in
the
world.
Um,
that
includes
really

large
Fortune
10
enterprises,
but
also

newer
leading
AI
companies
like
Harvey,

Rogo,
and
Meror.
To
date,
we've

processed
more
than
a
billion
pages
for

them
and
are
continuing
to
grow
every

single
week.

Ever
since
I
was
young,
I
always
used
to

have
side
hobbies.
In
high
school,
I

saw
an
article
that
said
something
like
the

creator
Flappy
Birds
making
$50,000
a

day
on
ad
revenue.
So,
me
and
my
best

friend
in
high
school
just
immediately

had
this
gut
reaction
of,
you
know,

forget
school,
forget
all
of
that.
we're

just
going
to
make
apps
and
that's
going

to
be
our
future.
At
some
point,
we
even

discussed
not
going
to
college.
Things

didn't
work
out
that
way.
Uh
we
tried
a

few
things
but
did
end
up
going
to

college
and
you
know
pursuing
a
longer

career
from
there.
But
I
think
it
was
a

really
nice
inspiration
that
kind
of

showed
how
going
off
the
beaten
path

[music]
can
lead
to
outlier
outcomes
for

folks.
Even
though
we
don't
work
on
game

development
today,
I
do
think
there's

something
very
valuable
about
seeing

individual
effort
that's
you
know

sometimes
just
start
as
side
projects

spiral
into
something
much
much
bigger.

that
eventually
led
to
me
going
to
MIT

did
my
undergrad
in
computer
science.

I
remember
I
was
taking
my
first
grad

level
ML
course.
Um
so
it
was
a
course

on
metalarning
like
teaching
models
to

learn
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
course

the
professor
introduces
Ronic
who
at

this
point
is
a
freshman
like
it's
his

first
week
on
campus
probably
and
he

frames
it
as
hey
everyone
meet
Ronic

he's
going
to
walk
you
through
how
to
do

the
first
pets.
Um,
so
Ronic
was
a

learning
assistant
um
for
this
course

that
was
primarily
PhDs.
And
that
was

crazy
to
me.
Like
it
was
this
person

that
even
though
he
had
just
come
on

to
campus
um
a
campus
with
really
smart

and
exceptional
people,
he
was
already
at

sort
of
the
top
um
and
so
we
became

really
close
from
there.
The
first
time

Ronic
suggested
that
we
could
work
on

something
together,
that
was
an

immediate
yes
for
me.
Like
I
didn't

think
twice
about
leaving
my
job
or

anything
like
that.
He
was
just
somebody

that
I
admired
enough
for
it
[music]
to

just
be
a
no-brainer.
So
in
the
course

of
the
company
before
the
YC
batch
we

actually
gave
up
on
revenue
multiple

times.
We
tested
different
ideas
got
to

a
point
where
people
were
willing
to
pay

for
it
but
decided
that
the
urgency
with

which
they
were
willing
to
pay
for
it
or

like
the
need
to
which
they
wanted
the

product
wasn't
high
enough
for
us
to

want
it.
And
so
just
to
give
you
a
sense

of
what
this
looked
like
tangibly
when

we
were
selling
remember
all
um
we
would

constantly
find
you
know
at
best
people

were
willing
to
pay
$50
a
month
or
maybe

$100
a
month.
So
remember
all
as
a

product
was
at
that
time
the
first

long-term
memory
API
[music]

for
language
models
to
remember
things

that
you'd
mentioned
in
the
past.
We

would
store
context
that
[music]
was

important
and
retrieve
it
when
it
was

relevant.
As
you
would
talk
about
things

like
implementation
times,
it
was
never

the
number
one
thing
that
they
needed
to

focus
on.
And
this
was
kind
of
one
of

those
things
that
was
nice
[music]
to

have.
In
comparison,
one
of
the
things

that
we
built
for
remember
all
is
people

would
say,
"Hey,
you're
managing
the

user's
chat
history.
[music]
Can
you

also
manage
the
files
that
they
upload?"

Um
almost
like
a
managed
drag
service.

And
we
saw
that
as
you
know
a
simple

feature
that
we
would
add
with

off-the-shelf
tools.
[music]
When
we

would
demo
remember
all
we
would
find

that
people
would
get
really
excited

about
the
fact
that
we
were
managing
the

files
that
they
uploaded.
We
had
put
so

much
time
into
making
that
[music]
file

management
better.
Um
we
started

training
our
own
models.
Um
we
did
a

technical
blog
in
YC's
forum
talking

through
how
we
segment
[music]
documents

that
wasn't
packaged
as
you
know
a
clean

demo
or
anything
like
that.
It
was
a

really
simple
streamlit
app.
It
was

you
would
upload
a
documents
and
we
would

draw
boxes
on
that
document.
And

surprisingly
here
it
was
almost
like

they
[music]
were
pulling
us.
They

immediately
started
replying
with,
"Hey,

these
are
better
results
than
what
I'm

seeing
from
my
existing
[music]
vendor.

Is
this
a
hosted
API?
Do
you
have
a

Stripe
link?
Like
can
I
purchase
this?

Can
I
start
using
this?"
It's
almost

like
a
slap
in
the
face
in
terms
of
how

much
the
market
wants
the
product.
And

so
when
we
were
considering
whether
or

not
we
should,
you
know,
have
high

conviction
in
the
space
or
not,
that
was

the
biggest
thing
that
concerned
[music]

us.
We
knew
that
in
a
year,
two
years,

three
years,
in
some
span
of
time,
um

long-term
memory
would
need
to
exist.

But
what
we
wanted
was
to
solve
the

problems
that
people
needed
[music]

solved
immediately
to
solve
the
things

that
they
were
actively
looking
for

solution
for.
And
we
decided
that

remember
all
was
not
that.

There
are
quite
a
few
different
ways

that
somebody
can
demonstrate
how
much

your
product
means
to
them.
It's
not

just
the
money,
it's
the
time
that

they're
willing
to
put
into
making
the

product
great
together.
We've
put
a
ton

of
time
into,
you
know,
aggregating

data.
Um,
it's
a
big
part
of
what
we
do

and
it's
a
big
part
of
why
we've
been

able
to
train
state-of-the-art
models,

but
production
data
is
different.
We

work
with
really
intensive
financial,

healthcare,
insurance
use
cases
that

you're
never
going
to
find
on
the

internet.
And
so,
really
quickly,
we

started
having
customers
that,
you
know,

had
tried
public
documents
and
saw

exceptional
performance,
but
they
would

come
to
us
with
the
most
esoteric

examples
[music]
imaginable.
Like
we've

seen
really
hard
cases
where
a
doctor

annotated
things
and
you
know
they
just

put
things
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and

you
were
supposed
to
understand
that
it

related
to
the
thing
at
the
top.
We
see

really
intensive
financial
tables
with

thousands
of
rows
of
data
everything

along
those
lines.
The
nice
thing
is
our

customers
want
us
to
solve
those
and
so

we've
always
had
this
almost
design

partner
like
relationship
where
they

will
come
to
us
with
that
sort
of

feedback
and
we
will
iterate
day
after

day
after
day
to
make
the
models
better.

And
when
you
fix
that
feedback,
they
end

up
telling
you
whether
or
not
that

worked
or
it
didn't.
And
you
iterate
by

the
end
of
that
first
week,
you've

already
made
a
ton
of
progress
with

them.
And
that
is
really
meaningful
in

that
they
care
to
make
sure
that
your

product
is
great.
Like
you're
on

the
same
team,
you
want
to
make
the
product

better
together
because
the
work
that
we

do
directly
helps
them
too.
And
so
from

the
early
days
even
to
now,
we
would

set
up
individual
Slack
channels
with
all
of

our
customers.
I
have
their
phone

numbers
like
we
would
call
directly
and

if
they
ran
into
issues
they
would
just

call
us
um
like
they
would
tell
us
hey

like
this
isn't
working
we
need
this
for

a
big
customer
and
we
would
work
late

into
the
nights
to
make
sure
that
it
was

working
for
them
because
we
don't
take

it
lightly
that
people
decided
to
trust

us
from
an
early
stage.
They
have
many

reasons
to
not
um
they
have
all
the

reasons
in
the
world
to
choose
an

established
company
that
you
know
has

been
around
for
a
decade
and
part
of
the

way
to
pay
back
the
trust
that
they've

given
us
is
to
be
there
for
them
on
an

individual
level.
So
even
today
you
know

if
a
company
has
an
issue
they
can
just

pay
Ronic
or
me
directly.
Part
of
what

they're
getting
with
Reduct
is
us
as

their
ingestion
team.

There's
a
world
where
we
just
relied
on

marketing.
Hey,
it's
the
best
product.

Hey,
it's
state-of-the-art.
All
those

things.
But
there
are
many
companies

that
can
say
that.
And
on
the
flip
side,

the
other
thing
that
we
could
do
is

actually
put
the
product
in
front
of

people
even
if
it
wasn't
a
perfect

platform
to
let
them
see
on
their

hardest
documents
that
it
works
to
prove

what
you're
saying
is
true.
And
that

translated
to
the
company
growing
really

quickly.
At
least
in
our
case,
being

[music]
public
in
that
way
um
just
meant

that
companies
that
otherwise
probably

would
have
ignored
Reducto
became
really

interested.
Um
like
when
we
were

twoerson
company,
[music]

trillion
dollar
enterprise
decided
to

book
a
demo
and
the
reason
why
they

booked
a
demo
is
because
we
had
that

public
playgrounds
where
they
uploaded

hard
documents
that
they'd
seen
fail
on

every
other
vendor.
And
once
they
saw

that
work,
that
justified
reaching
out.

And
if
we
hadn't
done
that,
if
we
were

this
twoperson
company
of,
you
know,

20some
year
olds,
I
find
it
hard
to

imagine
that
they
would
even
be

interested
in
engaging
with
us.
Um,

if
we'd
been
shy
about
what
we
were

building,
we
probably
would
have
never

gotten
on
the
phone
with
them.
When
we

say
that
we
are
the
most
accurate

product
in
the
market,
we
really
mean

it.
Here
are
some
examples,
but
if
you

want
to
see
further,
like
you
can
test

that
for
yourself.
We've
had
companies

[music]
that
I've
tried
to
sell
to
two,

three
times
and
for
one
reason
or

another,
they
weren't
sure
if
they

could,
you
know,
trust
this
early
stage,

seedstage
company
with
what
they
were

doing,
even
though
they
like
the

product.
And
what's
interesting
is

pretty
much
all
of
those
companies
have

since
come
back
to
us.
Like
they
have

come
inbound
saying,
"Hey,
we've
been

really
impressed
by
the
work
that
you've

been
doing.
We
see
the
progress
that

Reduct
keeps
making
month
over
month."

And
they're
ready
to
buy.
Um
and
so
as

the
company's
grown,
the
companies
that

we
struggle
to
sell
to
in
year
one,
um

we're
fortunate
to
call
customers
today

in
year
two.

I
had
known
quite
a
few
investors
from

just
the
course
of
building
the
company.

And
I
think
a
lot
of
early
stage

founders
think
in
terms
of
firm
brand.

um
like
they
only
think
of
tier
one
VCs

as
the
actual
firm
which
you
know
many

of
these
firms
have
been
around
for

decades
and
you
know
have
their
own

reputation
from
[music]
them
but
at
the

end
of
the
day
the
thing
that
matters

most
is
ideally
whoever
you're
raising

money
from
like
that
individual
partner

is
somebody
that
you're
going
to
be

partnering
[music]
with
for
the
next
10

years.
They're
going
to
be
there
in
all

of
your
great
successes
like
your
future

fundraising
rounds
when
you
close
the

great
contracts
but
they'll
also
be

there
for
the
bad
moments
of
the

company.
They'll
be
there
when
you
have

to,
you
know,
let
an
employee
go.
Um,

they'll
be
there
when
you
lose
a

contract.
They'll
be
there
when
you
have

a
big,
I
[music]
don't
know,
media

incident,
whatever
could
happen
in
the

lifetime
of
the
company.
But
it's
really

important
to
see
how
their
interactions

changed
when
things
weren't
going
well.

I
remember
there
was
a
moment
where
Liz,

our
seed
investor,
actually
basically

never
takes
time
off.
If
I
text
her
at

10:00
p.m.,
she's
replying
at
10:05.

[music]

She's
getting
on
the
phone
like
doing

whatever.
And
one
of
the
only
moments

where
she
was
taking
time
for
herself,
I

think
she
was
at
a
Broadway
show
with

her
husband
tragically.
Like
I
I
wish
we

hadn't
done
this.
Um
[music]
but
we
had

a
opening
eye
outage
at
the
same
time.

And
so
Veronica
was
like
frantically,

you
know,
messaging
her
like,
"Hey,
like

what
do
we
do?
Our
keys
aren't
working.

Customers
are
upset."
And
even
though

it
was
one
of
the
only
times
that
she
had

to
herself,
she
just
immediately
stepped

out.
She
started
calling
people
in
her

network
and
very
quickly
actually
had

the
chief
product
officer
at
the
company

on
the
phone
trying
to
help
us
with
our

issue
and
we
were
not
an
important

enough
customer
for
them
to
be
doing

that.
These
partners
are
committed
to

helping
the
company
succeed
and
[music]

that
is
really
important.
So
if
you're

an
early
stage
founder
thinking
about

who
to
raise
from,
take
the
time
to

actually
understand
[music]
what
that
is

going
to
look
like
um
because
it's
one

of the
most
important
decisions
you'll

have
to
make.

I
think
with
every
moment
that
is
really

exciting
in
a
company,
the
thing
that

isn't
discussed
in
interviews
is
[music]

what
it
took
to
get
to
that
moment.
Um,

like
when
we
were
landing
our
first

really
big
enterprise
contract,
it
was

an
on-prem
deployments
and
we
had
never

done
an
on-prem
deployment
before.
You

know,
we
[music]
didn't
have

infrastructure
engineers
on
team,
we

weren't
this
large
org
that
could
divvy

up
responsibilities.
We
would
wake
up,

we
would
immediately
go
to
the
office

and
we
would
be
in
the
office
until

[music]
we
were
too
exhausted
to

continue
working.
We
would
sleep
for

at
most
a
few
hours
and
then
we
would
go

back
and
we
would
try
again
and
again

and
again.
People
diving
in
and
doing

anything
[music]
at
the
company.
There's

no
sort
of
notion
of
hey
if
you're

an
engineer
you
don't
need
to
do
customer

support.
There's
no
notion
of
like
hey

you
know
if
you're
an
ops
person
you

don't
need
to
label
data
for
the
ML
team

because
everybody
just
wants
to
see
the

company
succeed.
Um,
and
the
company

succeeds
when
all
of
these
things
work,

when
the
product
works,
[music]
when

customers
are
happy.
And
people
don't

think
of
their
job
in
terms
of
whatever

their
role
title
is.
They
think
of
it
in

the
capacity
that
they
[music]
can
help

the
company
move
forward.
And
so
what
I

see
reductive
as
it,
it's
not
really

just
parsing.
It's
what
does
it
mean

to
have
this
layer
that
connects
human

data
to
this
new
level
of
intelligence
that

applies
across
all
of
that
data.
Um,

we're
seeing
products
built
with

productto
today
that
don't
just
read

the
documents,
they
actually
create
net
new

documents
for
their
end
customers.
Like

they
do
end-to-end
work
with
agentic
um,

[music]
workflows.
In
the
future,

most
AI
products
will
be
some
component

of
intelligence.
That
is
what
the

foundation
model
companies
provide,

but

it
will
be
some
components
of
context
as

well.
[music]
And
we
want
reductus
to

be
the
best
way
that
you
interact
with

that
context,
like
a
building
block
that

you
aggregate
together
and
apply
[music]
it

to
a
specific
use
case.
