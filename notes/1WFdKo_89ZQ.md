title: 杰西·巴克利谈《哈姆雷特》、母性觉醒与家族诅咒的终结
---

### 访谈开场：从银幕母性到真实生活

欢迎收听《现代之爱》播客，本期主持人是安娜·马丁。我们刚刚观看了由保罗·梅斯卡尔（Paul Mescal）和杰西·巴克利（Jessie Buckley）主演的新电影《**哈姆内特**》（Hamnet：电影《哈姆雷特》的灵感来源，基于莎士比亚丧子事件的虚构故事）。片中他们扮演威廉·莎士比亚（William Shakespeare）和他的妻子安妮（Agnes），共同哀悼他们独子的逝去。虽然电影是虚构的，但它基于可能启发了莎士比亚创作戏剧《**哈姆雷特**》（Hamlet）的真实事件。这是一部极具毁灭性、光芒四射的电影，杰西·巴克利的表演堪称大师级，我认为她抢尽了风头，这也是我非常期待能与她坐下来，探讨这个角色、她扮演母亲的经历，以及随后她自己成为母亲的真实体验的原因。此外，她还将为我们朗读一篇关于母女间牢不可破的纽带的文章。

<p class="english-text">Love now and fall in love. Still I love stronger than anything you love. For the love of love. >> And I love you more than anything. >> There's still love. >> From the New York Times. I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. I just saw the new movie Hamnet starring Paul Mell and Jesse Buckley. They play William Shakespeare and his wife Anes grieving the loss of their only son. And while the movie is fiction, it's based on real events that might have inspired Shakespeare to write his play Hamlet. This is a devastating, brilliant movie. Jesse Buckley is masterful. I think she stole the show, which is why I was so excited to sit down with her to talk about this role, her experience of playing a mother on screen, [music] and then the experience of becoming a mother in real life. Plus, she reads an essay about the unbreakable bond between a mother and a daughter. [music] >> Jesse Buckley, welcome to the show. >> A thank you. Thanks for having me. >> You recently had a baby. Congratulations. >> Thank you. >> How is everyone doing? Everyone's doing great. It's I mean, everything's different. I remember my one of my friends when I was pregnant sent me something that really resonated with me and was like such a little gift. But she said, "Just remember that you you are also a new thing. >> Everything's new." You know, this little human's new. You're new. Your relationship's new. The whole your whole relationship to the world is new. It's intense, but it's just I just love it.</p>

### 成为“新事物”：初为人母的敬畏与发现

“你也是一个新事物”——这是一个美丽而充满智慧的说法。您能举一个具体的、哪怕是很小的例子，说明自从成为母亲后，事物变得“新”体现在哪些方面吗？

我记得，孩子刚出生时，他们正在迅速地吸收和孕育着海量的信息。但最常提醒我的是“敬畏感”（awe），以及发现和探索。我感受到的就是这种敬畏和发现，但有时也会让人感到非常脆弱，因为一切都太新了，你未必能掌控这种新的发现。你只是处于与之相关的状态中。这是一种非常直接、纯粹、非常原始的感觉。我想，随着我们年纪渐长，我们总以为自己有掌控力了。[笑声] 是的，是的。我最近在火车上看到——我不知道，我不是在宝宝的大脑里，但我所感知到的是，宝宝发现了它有一根拇指。你知道，我看着我自己的拇指，心想：我甚至都不会去想这根拇指。[笑声] 这正是我所说的，我看到这个宝宝看着自己的拇指，心想：“这是什么？” 每天能和你的宝宝一起经历成千上万次这样的时刻，一定非常非凡。天哪。是的，我真的能看到她的小小个性开始显现出来。我看到了她身上的生命力，以及她的决心，我希望她能像我一样热爱生活。[抽鼻子] [清嗓子]

<p class="english-text">>> You are also a new thing is a beautiful and wise sentiment. Can you give me a sort of specific way and it can be really small that things are new now that you're a mother? I think the thing that you get reminded of the most is, you know, a child is discovering so much so quickly at such, you know, when they're just born and they're incubating so much information, but the thing that I'm reminded of is awe like how is like how much awe uh and and discovery and that's what I feel and and and all can sometimes times feel very vulnerable, you know, because you don't have kind of it's so new and you don't necessarily have kind of control of this new discovery. You're just in relation to it. And it's such a kind of immediate pure uh very primal thing. And I guess as we get older, we think we we think we have control. [laughter] >> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I was on the train recently and I saw I mean I don't know I'm not inside this baby's brain but what I perceive to be the baby discovering it had a thumb >> you know I'm looking at my own thumb I'm like I don't even think about this thumb [laughter] which is sort of what you're saying but it's like I saw this baby sort of looking at their thumb and being like >> what the and that's a beautiful to to have so many thousands of moments like that with your baby thousands hundreds many moments with your baby a day must be remarkable. God. Yeah, it's I really um can see her little personality start to come through. Um I see this life force in her um and determination and um I I hope she loves life as much as I do.

### 银幕上的狂野之爱与温柔力量

我非常期待谈论《哈姆内特》。这是一个关于莎士比亚11岁的儿子哈姆内特去世，以及这件事如何启发了他的戏剧《哈姆雷特》的故事。这部电影的焦点并不在莎士比亚身上。影片更多地关注您的角色**安妮**（**Anas**：莎士比亚的妻子，电影中由杰西·巴克利饰演），她是莎士比亚的妻子。我能问一下吗？当我们看到她在银幕上，您扮演她时，首先映入我眼帘的是她的“狂野”特质，对吗？在最早的几个场景之一中，她蜷缩在一棵树上。她与自然、与狂野有一种神秘的联系。她很脏，她驯养猎鹰，她热爱草药。这种狂野特质是否与您产生共鸣？如果是，是在哪些方面呢？

哦，是的。它深深地与我产生了共鸣。我想，我们所有人在某种程度上都与此产生共鸣。我们只是与我们自己的狂野性、与我们自己对大地、对自然、对我们人类自身状况和人性（human nature）的关系变得如此疏远。我是在爱尔兰南部一个叫卡尼（Khani）的地方长大的，那里被群山和湖泊环绕。我生命之初是住在父亲曾经拥有的一个客栈的棚屋后面，然后我们搬到山脚下的一所房子里。我深切地感觉到，在一个事物因为它们想要生长而生长的环境中长大……[停顿] 爬山让你明白，相对于这个宏大的世界，你只是一个微不足道的小东西。[笑声] 对我来说，这与安妮这个角色产生了共鸣：我们看到她拥有这种狂野、原始、与生俱来的天性，事实上，她甚至在一棵树的根部分娩。您刚才分娩了，您在想那个场景时，有没有觉得：“绝对不行。” 我当时心想：“好吧，[笑声] 快出来，快出来。”[笑声] 是的。不，我感觉，人们认为这个女人可怕之处在于，她对让她感到真正活着的那个地方毫不妥协。我想，在拍摄《哈姆内特》时，我非常渴望自己成为一位母亲，能够通过这个女人、她的母性、她的爱和她的失落来体验这一切，然后我才真正成为母亲。而且，我认为，即使在怀孕期间以及整个孕期，我如何思考我想要的生产方式，以及我将如何在可能的情况下自主选择，这都非常有力量。所以，我想……我没有在树根下分娩。[笑声] 好的，我们澄清了这一点。但我确实希望尽可能地掌控自己的身体，并能够选择我想要的分娩方式。您提到了，在拍摄《哈姆内特》时，您还不是母亲，但您却能……当我在这部电影中看到您时，您如此完美地体现了那种狂野的爱，就像我们刚才谈到的那种母性的原始的温柔。当时您依靠什么来塑造角色？您那时还没有怀孕。您依靠了什么？[叹气] [抽鼻子] 嗯，我想，我当时可能没有意识到，这是我正在寻找的东西，但“以一个坚强的女性身份步入温柔”是我最渴望饮用的水。直到我通过这个女人真正体验到它，我才意识到这一点。而且，有时候，如果你很坚强，就没有载体来表达这种温柔，[笑声] 你知道吗？温柔其实是极其坚强的，同时，温柔也是极其脆弱的。从那种柔软的地方出发，这改变了我，改变了我的全部。

<p class="english-text">I'm so excited to talk about Hamnet. This is a story about the death of Shakespeare's 11-year-old son, Hamnet, and how that inspired his play Hamlet. The movie does not focus on Shakespeare. The film is more about your character, Anas, who's based on Shakespeare's wife. Can I ask you like, you know, the first thing that strikes me when we see, you know, her on screen, you on screen playing her, is her wildness, right? Like one of the first scenes she's curled up in a tree. She has this sort of mystical connection with nature, with the wild. She's dirty. She's taming falcons. She loves herbs. Does that wildness resonate with you? And if so, in what ways? >> Oh, no. It like deeply resonates with me. I I think it probably resonates with us all in some shape or form. We've just become so disconnected from our own wildness and our own relationship to the earth and to nature and to our own condition as humans and human nature. Um, I grew up in nature. I grew up in a place called Khani in southern Ireland in Kerry and um it's surrounded by mountains and lakes and um I started off my life living in the back of a shed of a guest house that my father used to own and then we moved up and to a house at the bottom of a mountain and I very much feel like growing up in an environment where things grew because they want to grow and um you know M >> climbing mountains gave you an absolute respect [laughter] that you're only a tiny tiny thing in relation to a world that is is so big [laughter] to me that also resonates with the character of Anas like we see her have this wild primal innate nature and in fact you know she gives birth inside of a tree. I mean, you just gave Did you think of that scene when you two were giving birth? Were you like, >> "Hell no." I was like, "Okay, [laughter] get this. Get out." [laughter] >> Yeah. No. >> No. I I I I uh you know, I feel like what is deemed fearful about this woman is that she is uncompromising about where she actually feels alive. I think I when I was filming Hamnlet, I I deeply wanted to become a mother in myself and it was such a gift to move through this woman and her motherhood and her love and her loss before I became a mother myself. Um, and I think even, you know, getting pregnant and throughout my pregnancy and how I was thinking about what kind of birth I wanted and how I would be autonomous in choosing that when it as much as I could was very empowering. So, I think >> uh I didn't give birth to the root of a tree. [laughter] >> Okay, we've cleared that up. But I did want to be in my body as much as I could and be able to choose what kind of birth I wanted to have. I mean, you're you're bringing this up that when you were filming Hamnit, you were not a mother yet, but you were able to I mean, when I watched you in this film, you so embodied that kind of wild love, as we're talking about that that like primal tenderness of motherhood. What did you draw on at that time? You weren't pregnant yet. What did you What did you draw on? [sighs] [snorts] Um, I think that was one of the things that I uh [sighs] I probably didn't realize it at the time that this was a thing that I was looking for, [gasps] but to step into tenderness as a strong woman was something that I it was like the water that I wanted to drink the most. And until I kind of got to live it through this woman, I didn't realize it. Um, and sometimes there's not a vehicle for that if you're strong, [laughter] you know, and it's tenderness is such a like it's actually incredibly strong to be tender. And it's also deeply vulnerable to be tender. And actually to leave from a place of that softness was I mean it's changed me. It's changed my everything.</p>

### 银幕体验与现实的交织：关于失去的尖叫

您在扮演这种温柔时，正如我们之前所说，您自己也成为了母亲，现在电影上映了，您有了宝宝。当您现在以母亲的身份回看这部电影时，您觉得您演对了吗？有没有什么您想做得不同的地方？[笑声] 嗯，我不认为，不，我不认为有任何我会做得不同的地方。我第一次看这部电影时，我已经怀孕8个月了。[笑声] 那是什么感觉？非常紧张。[笑声和吸气声] 是的，是的。我不知道。我感觉……我并不惊讶我怀孕了，[笑声] 我在拍完戏后一周就怀孕了。[吸气声] 我……我……我……我……我……[停顿] 你说你想要成为一个妈妈，对吧？是的，是的。在我处于绝对母亲的状态，而这还不是现实时，有那种需求，也相当强烈。你知道，有些时刻让我心碎，因为我活在一个“替代世界”里，我绝对是那个母亲，但（现实中）我却要保持耐心。[笑声] 是的。我的意思是，我们谈到了母性对您来说是一种彻底的改变。我们谈到了您在成为母亲之前无法触及的那种温柔。在《哈姆内特》中，我们也看到了安妮如何真正爱上了她的孩子们——那种纯粹、美丽、温柔的爱。而在影片的另一端，我们看到了一个让所有人都议论纷纷的场景，它给我留下了深刻的印象——“印象”这个词可能太轻描淡写了。安妮竭尽全力想保住她的儿子哈姆内特。他病了，但她没有成功，他死了。有一个场景是您发出了尖叫，一声原始的尖叫。我想知道，在您的身体内部，那是一种什么样的体验？

嗯，我不知道那个尖叫会出来。那个不在剧本里。[吸气声] 天哪。是的。我们所有人都不知道那会发生。[笑声] 发生。我们没有排练过。我们只是在某一天开放了，然后……我想，作为一个团队，我们都走进了一条河流，你知道，但我们不知道那条河会带我们去哪里。我想，那时我们可能正拍到中途。我与扮演哈姆内特的小演员贾克贝·朱普（Jackabe Jup）关系变得非常亲密。你知道，保罗和我都在其中，我与他们所有人都深深相连。我想，当你面对这样一个故事时，你很难想象悲伤从何而起，又在这样一个时刻如何结束，以及如何真正地……你如何表达那种情感？我甚至无法完全想象那种现实。但我知道悲伤，我知道爱，我知道我对那个小男孩的感受。[叹气] 我觉得，在某种程度上，那个尖叫不是……它非常古老。它就像是为所有以某种方式失去了孩子的百位母亲而发出的尖叫。怀着最大的敬意，我想我只是尽可能地深入那条河流，让它通过我这个容器释放出来。我不知道那是什么，它就是那样。[笑声] 请稍候。

<p class="english-text">you were embodying this tenderness, this character, as we said before, you were a mother yourself and now, you know, the the film is out. You you have a baby and I wonder as you watch this film, knowing what you know now being a mother now, is there do you think you got it right? Like, is there anything you would have done differently? [laughter] Um, I don't think, no, I don't I don't think there's anything I would have done differently. I I watched it for the first time when I was 8 months pregnant and [laughter] >> it was kind of >> What was that like? >> Uh, incredibly intense. [laughter and gasps] >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I don't know. I felt like I I I'm not surprised I got [laughter] you know I'm not I got pregnant a week after I finished filming [laughter] like [gasps] I I I had coaxed you know I I it was >> well you said you wanted to be a mom right? >> Yeah. Yeah. It was also quite intense to have that need while I was in this place of absolute mother and it not be a real thing yet. You know, there was moments where it broke my heart because I was living this altered world where I was absolutely that and but you know just be patient. [laughter] >> Yeah. I mean, you're [gasps] talking we we've spoken about um how motherhood is this kind of totalizing change for you. We've spoken about the kind of tenderness you weren't able to touch before you became a mother. In Hamnet as well, we watch as Anas, you know, really falls in love with her children. I mean, just this pure, beautiful, tender love. And at the other end of the spectrum in your film as well, we have this scene which everyone is talking about certainly. Um, it left an impression on me. An impression is even too light a word. Uh, Anest does everything she can to keep Hamnet, her son, alive. He is sick. Um, it doesn't work. He dies. And there's this scene where you do a a scream, a a primal scream, and I guess I would love to know what that was like for you inside of your body. >> Um, well, I didn't know that scream was going to come. That was not in the script. Um, >> oh my gosh. >> Yeah. I don't None of us knew that was going [laughter] to come. Um, and we didn't rehearse it. We just kind of opened up the day and and I guess as a as a team, we're all going into a river, you know, um, but we don't know where that river is going to take us. And >> um, I guess at that point we're probably midway through filming. And I had I had got very close with little Jackabe Jup who plays Hamnet. And you know Paul and I were in it and I was deeply connected to all of them. And I guess you know when when you get some a story like this it is kind of impossible to imagine where grief begins and ends with a moment like that and how to actually what do you you know how do you express that? I can't even imagine the reality fully of that. But it was I know grief. I know love. I know what I felt for that little boy. And [sighs] I feel like in some ways that scream isn't it's very it's ancient. It's kind of like a scream for a 100 mothers who've lost their children in some way. And with utter respect, I guess I just tried to go as far in that river as I could and let that come through me in a as a vessel. And I don't know what it is. It just that's what it is. [laughter] Stay with us. You've been [music] talking about, you know, the the transformational power as it were of motherhood that we certainly see in Hamnet and and we also see in this Modern Love essay you're going to read for us today. Before we get into it, is there anything you want to say to to tee up this story? tea up the story. Um, it's no joke being born. [laughter] >> It's a big old thing. >> It's not what I thought you were going to say. >> It's a big >> It is no joke being born. I agree with you. [laughter] >> Um, and how kind of beautiful and vulnerable and and you know, >> it can give you the most surprising strength. M</p>

### 家族诅咒与代际创伤的阴影

接下来，我们将进入维多利亚·达里（Victoria Dari）的《错误的遗产》（The wrong kind of inheritance）这篇文章的朗读部分。

我一直知道我的一两个孩子身上会发生什么。我从没有把话说出口，也不允许自己沉溺于此。但那种感觉一直存在。一种在我偏执的日子里会造访我的模糊的迷信。那种日子会让我午夜时分走进孩子们的房间，[音乐] 确保他们还在呼吸。这种迷信有一部分源于我的血统。我来自一个来自前**捷克斯洛伐克**（Czechoslovakia：文章作者祖父母逃离的国家）的斯拉夫民族的悠久谱系，那里很多人相信诅咒。但我的恐惧得到了一个事实的佐证：我的母亲和我的外祖母都以毁灭性的方式失去了孩子。60年前，我的祖母大胆地从战后的捷克斯洛伐克逃出来，与她的丈夫团聚，却被共产主义者阻止，无法接回他们留在那里的三个女儿——我的母亲和两个阿姨。我的祖母有二十年没能再见到她的孩子们。到那时，我的母亲已经在他们狭小的捷克斯洛伐克村庄里，因流感失去了她四岁的儿子维克多（Victor）。几个月后，带着她幸存的弟弟，她冒着入狱和被机枪扫射的危险逃到了美国，并在那里生下了我。

<p class="english-text">the wrong kind of inheritance by Victoria Dari I always knew something would happen [music] to one of my children. I never said it out loud. I didn't allow myself to dwell on it. But the feeling was there. A vague superstition that visited me on my paranoid days. The kind of day that would find me in my children's room at midnight [music] making sure they were still breathing. Some of this superstition is in my heritage. I'm from a long line of Slavs from what used to be Czech Slovakia where a lot of people believe in curses. But my fear is bolstered by the fact that both my mother and my mother's mother have lost children in devastating ways. 60 years ago, my grandmother daringly escaped from postwar Czechoslovakia to join her husband, only to be foiled by the communists, from reclaiming the three daughters they had left behind, my mother and two aunts. My grandmother wasn't able to see her children again for two decades. By that time, my mother had already lost her four-year-old son, Victor, when he died from the flu in their tiny Czechoslovak village.</p>
</details>

### 恐惧的代价与母女间的鸿沟

我们的传统认为诅咒是成三而来的。虽然地理上的变化无疑改善了我们家族的处境，但我担心诅咒不会太远。所以我等待着我的那一份。当它来临时，我知道那将是具有圣经规模的事件，堪比蝗虫成群或大地将我吞噬，是我无法应对的事情。毕竟，我不是什么自由斗士或跨越边境的人。我只是芝加哥郊区一个中产阶级女孩。我确信，一旦轮到我分担家族的痛苦，我那安逸的美国生活将是我的毁灭。这件事已经对我和我母亲的关系造成了影响，在我们之间形成了一道我们似乎无法跨越的鸿沟。我与母亲的关系似乎主要由尴尬的午餐构成，午餐以美好的初衷开始，但很快就冷却下来，常常在用餐中途以她一句“好吧，我得走了”而结束。我怀疑这是否是一种文化差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Months later, with my surviving brother in tow, she risked prison and the threat of machine guns to escaped to the United States where she gave birth to me. Our tradition holds that curses come in threes. And while the change in geography was a definite improvement for our family, I feared that the curse couldn't be far behind. So I waited my turn. When it came, I knew it would be something of biblical proportions, on par with swarms of locusts or the earth swallowing me whole, something I wouldn't be equipped to handle. After all, I was no freedom fighter or border crosser. I was just a middle-class girl from the Chicago suburbs. I was sure my soft American life would be my undoing once it was my turn to share some family anguish. It had already taken its toll on my relationship with my mother, creating a gulf between us. We couldn't seem to bridge. My relationship with my mother seemed to consist mostly of awkward lunches that started with a bang of best intentions, but quickly fizzled, often ending midmeal with her saying, "Well, got to go." I wondered if it was a cultural thing. As a child, I was embarrassed by everything about my mother. Her accent, her conservative political views, her vava voom beauty, and the way she dressed me like an off therackck hybrid of Elizabeth Taylor and Avana Trump. But it went deeper. Behind my mother's high-pitched giggle and enormous rhinestone brooches, under her Cleopatra style cosmetics and bold animal print pants suits was a remove and sorrow I could never penetrate. It was a result of years of being stalked by the Czechoslovak secret police, of missing her parents, of being forced upon resentful relatives, and more than anything, of not being able to save my brother.</p>

### 绝望中的连接：女儿的疾病与母亲的回归

我曾多次试图让她谈论此事。我想知道我的兄弟是谁，更重要的是，我想更亲近她。但她总是把我推开。“你根本不知道，”她会说，结束了谈话。“她说得对，因为即使在我自己成为父母之后，我也无法理解失去孩子的感受。”直到去年。在我第三次怀孕过半时，我的丈夫和我得知我们的宝宝尾骨上有一个罕见的肿瘤。在几周内，它在我体内生长得如此之大、如此明显，以至于陌生人都问我是否怀了双胞胎。到了孕晚期，这个肿瘤已经有一个篮球那么大了，并开始影响宝宝的肾脏和肝脏功能。约瑟芬（Josephine）早产7周，通过剖腹产出生。她没有自主呼吸。她被紧急送去做了一个长达8小时的手术。她的外科医生成功地切除了肿块并重建了她的尾部。我们希望事情就此结束，但事实并非如此。原来，约瑟芬的肿瘤并非最初预测的那样是良性的，而是具有侵袭性的癌症。在她出生的几个月里，她经历了五次手术和几轮化疗。诅咒降临了，而且是个大麻烦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd often tried to get her to talk about it. I wanted to know who my brother was and more important to get closer to her. But she always shut me down. "You have no idea," she would say, ending the conversation. "And she was right because even after becoming a parent myself, I couldn't wouldn't comprehend what it felt like to lose a child." until last year. A little more than halfway through my third pregnancy, my husband and I learned that our baby had a rare tumor on her tailbone. In a matter of weeks, it grew so large and distinct within me that strangers asked if I was carrying twins. By my last trimester, the tumor was the size of a basketball and had begun to compromise the baby's kidney and liver functions. Josephine was born by cesarian section 7 weeks early. She was not breathing on her own. She was rushed into 8 hours of surgery. Her surgeon was able to remove the mass and reconstruct her bottom. And we hoped that would be the end of it, but it wasn't. As it turned out, Josephine's tumor wasn't benign as originally predicted, but aggressive and cancerous. In the months following her birth, she would survive five surgeries and several rounds of chemotherapy. The curse had arrived, and it was a doozy.</p>
</details>

但大地没有将我吞噬。我能够站立不倒，并陪伴在我的女儿身边，原因很简单：我的母亲在我身边。当约瑟芬的肿瘤被发现时，我打电话给母亲，不是为了求助，只是为了告诉她这件事。她立刻收拾行李，离开了她在芝加哥的家和工作，连夜开车到我们在弗吉尼亚的家。随着约瑟芬的肿瘤每周翻倍长大，她的病情恶化，我母亲的探访也变得更加频繁。当我的背痛让我无法站在炉子旁时，她帮我搅拌燕麦粥。当我走路困难时，她带我的孩子们去公园。晚上，她给我揉脚。约瑟芬出生后，必须在费城儿童医院接受专家手术和治疗，我母亲和我一起在罗纳德·麦克唐纳之家（Ronald Macdonald House）搭铺过夜。当约瑟芬被转到弗吉尼亚大学医院时，我母亲搬进来和我们住在一起，待了好几个月。她会在医院通宵达旦地陪伴约瑟芬，这样我就可以照顾我的另外两个孩子了。[音乐] 她会给约瑟芬的手术疤痕盖上盖子，并用护士般专业的手法照顾她的造口。有时，她会如此专注地盯着约瑟芬的眼睛，我以为是她一个人在维持我女儿的生命。她为我们做饭打扫。她和我们一起欢笑。她甚至讲起了我已故兄弟的故事。

<p class="english-text">But the earth didn't swallow me whole. I was able to keep standing and be there for my daughter for one simple reason. My mother was there for me. When Josephine's tumor was discovered, I called my mother not to ask for help, but just to tell her. She immediately packed, left her home and job in Chicago, and drove through the night to our home in Virginia. As Josephine's tumor doubled in size weekly, and her condition worsened, my mother's visits became more frequent. She helped me stir oatmeal when the pain in my back kept me from standing at the stove. She took my children to the park when I had a hard time walking. She rubbed my feet at night. After her birth, Josephine had to be operated on and treated by specialists at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and my mother bunked with me at the Ronald Macdonald House. When Josephine was transferred to University of Virginia Hospital, my mother moved in with us and stayed for months. She kept late nights at the hospital, staying with Josephine so that I could care for my two [music] other children. She tented Josephine's surgical scars and cared for her osttomy with the expert hands of a nurse. At times, she stared so fiercely into Josephine's eyes that I thought she alone was keeping my daughter alive.</p>

### 共同的语言与和解

她为我们做饭打扫，和我们一起欢笑，甚至讲述了我已故兄弟的故事。有一天晚上，在我们发现我儿子在浴室里玩“靶射练习”——瞄准小便池的靶心，结果却射到了别处——她说道：“那不算什么。有一次我发现你兄弟俩互相对着小便，就像在玩枪战一样。砰砰。有两个男孩，总是有好玩的事情发生。”后来，她告诉我，维克多去世后，她甚至无法理解太阳怎么还能照常升起。这对她来说毫无意义。这是她第一次这样对我说话。

<p class="english-text">She cooked and cleaned our house. She laughed with us. She even told stories about my late brother. One night after we caught my son playing [music] target practice in the bathroom, aiming his urine at imaginary bullse yes and hitting everything but the toilet, she said, "That's nothing. One time I found your brothers shooting the pee at each other like they were shooting the gun. Bang bang. Having two boys, there was always something funny." Later, she told me that after Victor died, she couldn't even understand how the sun could be shining. It made no sense to her. It was the first time she had ever spoken to me this way.</p>

听我自己说出这些话，听起来很奇怪，考虑到约瑟芬这场战斗所带来的痛苦和动荡，但我和母亲度过了一段美好的时光。我们一起做炖牛肉（goulash），并用我们的第一种共同语言——捷克语交谈。我母亲认识了我们的朋友，朋友们也评论说我们多么相似。这是第一次，这种观察没有让我们彼此疲惫地对视，感到困惑和不适。我过去曾向朋友们做过“别理她，她有点疯”的背后手势，现在已经被想牵着她的手在街上散步的愿望所取代。当母亲向我的朋友们传授她所说的“生活经验”时——她赞美自己对理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）的热爱，称他是她最喜欢的美国总统——我再也不会感到尴尬了。约瑟芬的疾病很可能是某种诅咒的一部分，但它仍然是我一生中经历过的“最糟糕的好事”[音乐]。它永远夺走了我的内心平静，但它却让我拥有了我的母亲。我仍然太迷信，不敢宣布胜利，但看起来我的女儿[音乐]会挺过去的。如果她挺过去了，约瑟芬将打破这个诅咒[音乐]，并最终让一位母亲和她的孩子在她的家庭中团聚，而不是插入一道痛苦的隔阂。

<p class="english-text">It sounds strange to hear myself say it, given the pain and turmoil of Josephine's battle, but my mother and I had a wonderful time. We cooked goulash together and spoke in our first common language, Czech. My mother got to know our friends and our friends remarked on how similar we are. For the first time, this observation didn't leave us looking wearily at each other, perplexed and uncomfortable. The behind the back hand gestures I had once employed to signal to friends, "Don't mind her, she's a little crazy," have been replaced by a desire to hold her hand as we walk along the street. I'm no longer embarrassed when my mother gives my friends the lesson in the life, as she puts it, by extolling her love for Richard Nixon, her favorite American president. Josephine's illness may well be part of a curse, but it is still the best worst thing [music] ever to happen to me. While robbing me forever of my peace of mind, [music] it has given me my mother. I'm still too superstitious to declare victory, but it looks as if my daughter [music] is going to make it. If so, Josephine will have broken the curse [music] and at last brought a mother and her child together in her family instead of inserting a painful wedge.</p>

### 母亲的觉醒与声音的释放

几周前，我和母亲谈论我已故的兄弟。那是在维克多的生日临近的时候，这对她来说一直是一段艰难的时期[音乐]。通常在这个时候，她会退缩，躲避所有人，直到那一天过去。但今年没有。[音乐] 她忙着一块一块地组装我儿子的**千年隼乐高**（Millennium Falcon Lego：一个复杂的玩具模型），给我三岁的女儿涂上**妖艳的红色**[音乐]指甲油。当她剪掉为约瑟芬买的一件亮粉色豹纹睡衣的标签时，她的眼睛开始噙满泪水。“四十年来，我的心里一直有个空洞，”她低语道，“现在那个空洞被填满了。”

<p class="english-text">>> [music] >> My mother and I were talking about my late brother a few weeks ago. It was near Victor's birthday, which has always been a difficult [music] time for her. A time when she normally would have withdrawn and hid from everyone until the day passed. But not this year. [music] She was too busy assembling my son's Millennium Falcon Lego brick by brick and painting my three-year-old daughter's toenails [music] a tarty red. As she cut the tags off a hot pink leopard snugly she had bought for Josephine, her eyes began to fill with tears. "For 40 years I had a hole in [music] my heart," she whispered. And now that hole is filled. [music] We'll be right back. [music] >> [music]</p>

### 杰西·巴克利的感悟：打破诅咒的勇气

非常感谢您朗读这篇文章，杰西。趁着记忆还新鲜，您有什么感想？什么触动了您？哦，[叹气和吸气声] 太多了。我最近也想了很多关于我母亲的事情。你知道，这种诅咒，这种代代相传的古老诅咒，以及要如何摆脱这种诅咒是多么困难。就像生活中必须有某种东西来打断你，让你再次清醒过来，找回诅咒之外的自己的声音。而且，我确实体验到我的母亲最近为我和我们这个家庭打破了一个诅咒。看到她作为一个女人如此勇敢和无畏，使她成为了一个更加了不起、更加人性化的母亲。[抽鼻子和笑声] 是的。

<p class="english-text">>> Thank you so much for that reading, Jesse. While it's still fresh for you, what's coming up? What resonates? Oh. Um, so much [sighs and gasps] I've been thinking about my mother quite a lot too recently. And you know this curse, this kind of [snorts] um ancient curse that gets handed down through generations and how >> hard it is to dislodge yourself from that curse. Like something has to interrupt your life in some way to kind of wake you up and wake you up into yourself again and find your voice outside of the curse. And um I uh I definitely have experienced my mother crack a curse for me and for us as a family recently. And to see her be so brave and courageous as a woman has made her an even more incredible and human mother. [snorts and laughter] Um, yeah.</p>
</details>

当您说您的母亲打破了一个诅咒时，您指的是什么？我的第一个记忆是看到讲述故事和表达需求所产生的效果，那就是看到我母亲在教堂里唱歌。她是一位竖琴手兼歌手。她是一个一直对世界敞开双手的人，她非常渴望得到很多东西，但她没有意识到，她可以选择自己生活中比被教导的要多得多的东西。她把生命中的大部分时间都花在了自己生活的角落里。你知道，这个如此渴望融入世界的女人，却把她生命中的大部分时间都花在了角落里，只活了一小部分，或者只在很小一部分中被听到。然后我会在教堂看到她唱歌，感觉就像是生与死的较量，就像她需要将某种感觉从她的角落里释放到世界上。我看到了一件神奇的事情发生：通过她分享自己的声音和完整的自我[音乐]的勇气，她基本上粉碎了周围听众的防御系统。我会看到一些老男人，眼泪顺着脸颊流下来。我想，在她歌唱的那些时刻，她充满了力量，以至于她无法不触动那些最害怕被触动或感受任何事物的人。我知道，在她作为女人、作为母亲、作为妻子的许多年里，她并没有真正觉得自己有能力充分地活出这一切。直到几年前，她重返大学，重新学习成为一名**音乐心理治疗师**（Music Psychotherapist：通过音乐帮助他人（尤其是在生命边缘的人）进行情感表达和连接的专业人士），她从很小的时候就一直想获得高等教育。我的父母已经分开了。她现在拥有了自己的房子。她现在在临终关怀领域工作，既服务于新生儿，也服务于老年人。她现在已经六十多岁了，她为自己开启了全新的人生，这是一件非常非常勇敢的事情。她工作中的内容非常美妙，因为在她生命的大部分时间里，人们都不听她说话，而现在，那些处于生命边缘、或者没有能力交流的人，或者那些非常非常小的、生病的孩子，她正在唤醒这些人身上的某种东西。在解放自己、充分地生活、与那些可能即将逝去的事物建立起狂野的亲密关系方面，她太棒了，真是个了不起的女人。她叫玛丽娜（Marina）。

<p class="english-text">>> When you say she broke a curse, your mother, what do you mean by that? Um, my first memory of seeing the effect of telling a story and the need to express something was seeing my mother sing >> in church. and she's a harpist and a singer. And she is a woman who's always had her two hands up at the world. Like she wanted so much and didn't realize that she could pro that she could choose so much more of her life than what she was being taught she was allowed to choose for herself. She spent a lot of the time kind of in the corner of her life. You know, this woman who was so hungry to be in the world, spent a lot of her life in the corner, living a little bit of it or being heard in a little bit of it. And then I'd see her thing in church and it was like it was life and death. like her need to feel and put something out into the world like from her corner. And I'd see this magical thing happened where by her courage to share her voice and her whole self >> in song, she would basically pulverize the defense system in the people that were listening around her. And I'd see these old men with like tears streaming down their face come up. Um I guess in the moments that she sank, she was so full that it couldn't help but touch even the people that were most afraid to be touched or feel something. And I know for many years in her life as a woman and as a mother and as a wife, she didn't really feel like she had the capacity to live that fully in herself. and until a few years ago she went back to university and retrained as a music psychotherapist having saved 1250 since she was very young to go and get a third level education. Uh my parents no longer together. She now owns her own home. She now works uh in paliotative care for in neonatal but also for elderly people. and >> um she's in her 60s now and she's just started a whole life for herself and it's a very very brave thing to do. Um and and it's so beautiful what she does like in her work because you know for much of her life people didn't listen to her and now people who are at the right at the edge of their life or in or haven't got the capacity to communicate or you know tiny tiny babies that are very sick that have never she's waking something up in these people and um has found in in freeing herself and being as full in her life this wild intimacy with things that might be just about to be lost. She's amazing, amazing woman. Her name's Marina.</p>

### 对女儿的期许：接纳生命中的“过多”

玛丽娜，我正想问，杰西，谢谢你的分享。我有幸看着你的脸，听你讲述这个故事，以及你谈论你母亲时脸上流露出的微笑和光芒，这真的很美。我想问的是，这个故事不仅关乎作者和她的母亲，也关乎作者和她的女儿。我想继续这个思路，就像你目睹了你的母亲体现出这种自由一样，你希望你的女儿长大后，在你变老时，能从你身上看到什么呢？

天哪。哦，我……我希望我能传达给她的，而且我确定她会走上她自己的人生轨迹，她应该如此[笑声] [吸气声] 是……我们只有一次生命，我们的生命中总会有一些事情会让我们怀疑，或者感到害怕，或者觉得我们应该“更小”一些。我看到这个小小的生命如此新鲜，却又如此饱满，还没有被我们应该成为什么样的人的想法或投射所玷污。我只希望，如果我能把母亲传给我的东西传给她，那就是你所有的部分都不是“太多了”。你知道，世界需要全部的你。这意味着孕育挣扎，就像经历挣扎、阴影，那些会挑战你的东西。你必须代谢它，孕育它，而且……没有“过多”这种事。它只应被充分地生活。[笑声] 是的。[叹气和吸气声]

<p class="english-text">>> Marine, I was just gonna Jesse, thank you for sharing that. I'm I have the real privilege of watching your face as you tell this story and the smile, the the light that is is coming from you as you talk about your mom is is really beautiful. And I was going to ask, what's her name? Marina. And it makes me wonder, you know, this essay is a multi-generational essay. It's not just about the author and her mom. It's also about the author and and her daughter. And I I guess I just wonder to continue that thread, like having watched your mom >> embody this kind of freedom, like what do you hope your daughter sees in you as she gets older and as you get older as well? >> Oh god. Oh, I have I I um I just I I think the the the thing I can hope to impart to her and I'm sure she's going to go on her o whole own trajectory and I and she should [laughter] [gasps] is um we have one life and we're always going to be there's always going to be things in our life that are going to make us doubt um or be afraid or feel like we're to be, you know, it would be safer to be smaller in some way. And I see this little life that's so new but so full and so un kind of tarnished by an idea or projection of what we're supposed to be. And I just hope that if I can pass anything on to her in the way that my mother's passed on to me is that all the parts of you are not too much. You know, the world needs all of you. And that means incubating the struggles is like living through the struggles, the shadows, like the things that are going to challenge you. You have to metabolize it and incubate it and and it's you're not there's no too muchness. It's it's it's only to be lived fully. [laughter] Yeah.</p>

### 助产士的见证：生命、死亡与红毯

为了结束访谈，也为了将我们带回到您作为母亲的经历上。我最近在《哈姆内特》的首映式上看到，您带上了您的家人，还带上了您的助产士。这是真的吗？您是怎么知道的？我们在这里会做研究的。[笑声] [吸气声] 我想，您可能是第一个把助产士带到红毯上的人。天哪。[吸气声] 我在想，您为什么觉得在这次电影活动中，有助产士在身边很重要？因为我爱女人。我爱她们。我觉得她们太棒了。而且，她是我生命中一个非常非常重要的时刻的一部分，她是一位非凡的女性。我认为安妮是一位非凡的女性，我希望她们能相遇。我想，是的，助产士、女人、分娩、生命、死亡，你知道，她知道那是什么。[笑声]

We do our research here at [laughter] the New York Times. [gasps] >> And you know, I I mean, I wonder if you are the first person to ever bring a midwife on a to a red carpet. >> Oh my [laughter] god. >> I wonder. [gasps] I wonder, you know, what why was it important to have your midwife at this at this film with you? [sighs and gasps] Cuz I love I love women. [laughter] I love my I love them. I think they're amazing. And and um she was this extraordinary woman who was part of a very very important moment of my life. I think Anas is an extraordinary woman and I wanted them to meet. I think yeah, midwives, women, births, life, death, you know, she knows what that is. [laughter]</p>

她对这部电影的看法如何？她说了什么？嗯，我想这很奇怪。你知道，她看着我在浴室地板上像野牛一样咆哮了26个小时，你知道，她看到了我身体里的每一分每一毫……她看到了现实。[笑声] 然后我穿着一件礼服，她说：“哇，你看起来真迷人。”[笑声] 那太贴心了。我几乎……我更尴尬于自己看起来迷人，因为她了解我最原始的样子。她看到了狂野的一面。她看到了原始的一面。

<p class="english-text">>> What did she think of the movie? What did she say? >> Well, I think it's quite strange.

Sure. >> And then I'm like in a dress and she's like, "Well, you look very glamorous." [laughter] >> That is so sweet. >> And I'm almost like [gasps] I'm the I'm like so I'm I'm like totally I'm more so embarrassed to be glamorous because she knows me in my most primal.

她看到了原始的一面。您的母亲当时也在场吗？是的，她在场。她对这部电影有什么看法？我想，有时候这对我们的父母来说太沉重了。你知道，他们如此私密、如此深刻地了解你。而我母亲又在我的许多作品中，在我的许多方面。我希望，我希望我所做的一切，我希望她能认识到，我正试图保留我在很小的时候看到她唱歌时所看到的东西。[笑声] 我希望她能看到，我正努力保持那个声音的延续。

您告诉我关于观看她弹奏竖琴的事情，我想：“哇，在那个房间里，看着你在电影中的表现，我想知道，对她来说，那是否就是你演奏竖琴的体验。如果真是这样，那该多美妙啊。” 是的。[抽鼻子] [笑声] 天哪，杰西·巴克利，[音乐] 谢谢你。非常感谢。非常感谢。非常荣幸。
