### 欧洲银行业面临的挑战：规模与转型

**主持人**: 大家好，欢迎来到In Good Company。今天我非常荣幸能与**Andrea Orcel**同在，他也被称为银行业的**罗纳尔多**。Andrea在欧洲银行业留下了深刻的印记。他现在掌舵**UniCredit**，你的业务和生活中有许多令人兴奋的事情正在发生。热烈欢迎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Hi everybody and welcome to In Good Company and today I'm in a particularly good company because I'm here with **Andrea Oel** who is also called the **Ronaldo O banking**. Andrea has really left his mark on the European banking industry. He's now the helm of **UniCredit** and just so many exciting things going on in your business and in your life. So warm welcome.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 非常感谢。我很高兴来到这里。欧洲银行业目前面临的最大挑战是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here. What is the biggest challenge that the European banking industry is facing just now?

</details>

**主持人**: 规模和转型。我认为两者结合。规模很重要，因为没有规模，你就没有足够的创新能力，也没有足够的投资技术的能力，以及投资所有应该投资的事物以实现转型。而转型之所以重要，是因为我们过去倾向于将传统银行和金融科技公司分开看待。我们观察它们，但并未真正重视它们。但如果你看未来五到七年，它们将会融合。因此，你需要问自己，我能否提供相同水平的客户旅程和客户体验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Scale and transformation. I think they combine scale because without scale you don't have enough innovation. You don't have enough uh ability to invest in technology and in all the things that you should invest to then transform and transformation because we tended to look at legacy banks on one side, fintech on the other side. We looked at them, we didn't consider them. But if you take the next five years, five, seven years, they're going to converge. And therefore, you need to ask yourself, can I offer the same level of client journey, the same level of client experience

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 拥有相同水平的效率，并在它们不具备的方面击败它们，那就是我们拥有的主要客户，其次是处理多种产品和复杂性的能力。过去一直关注在每个国家拥有大量竞争，对吗？所以，理想情况下，竞争管理机构希望每个国家都有很多本地竞争。现在这种情况正在改变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: with the same level of efficiency and beat them on what they don't have, which is the clients that we start with, primary clients, and secondly, the ability to deal with multiple products and complexity. there's been a focus on on having um a lot of competition in each country, right? So, ideally the competition authorities have wanted to have, you know, a lot of local competition in each country. Is that changing now?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我认为地方当局希望有本地竞争，欧盟的竞争管理机构也在关注这一点。总的来说，如果你在任何一个领域市场份额接近25%，你就会被阻止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, I think uh local authorities have want local competition and the European Union, the competition authorities are looking at that. By and large, if you get close to 25% market share in every in any area, you get blocked. M

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以这是为了防止任何人降低竞争水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: so that is to prevent anyone from reducing that level of competition.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为这实际上并没有改变。实际上，有些市场，比如**德国**，其市场份额远低于其他所有国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I don't think that that is changing actually you have some market Germany is one of them where the market shares are way lower than everybody else

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 生活中的一切都讲究平衡。过高的市场份额和过大的规模不利于竞争和优质服务等。而过小的市场份额和过小的规模则会阻碍你为客户提供他们想要的服务，因为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and it's like everything in life it's a balance too much market share too much size does not support competition and a good service etc. too little market share and too little size prevents you from offering the clients what they want because

</details>

**主持人**: 对客户来说，什么是最好的？最好的市场结构是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: what's the best what's the best for clients what's the best market structure

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为是一个中间点。对我来说，这是一个中间点，你拥有足够的竞争。这取决于市场和客户群体，情况会有所不同，但我大体上同意，一旦你在任何地方的市场份额超过20%，你就需要开始问自己是否有足够的竞争。因为竞争会促使你做得更好。缺乏竞争则会让你停滞不前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think a midpoint. I think for me it's a midpoint where you have enough competition depending on the market and the client segment it changes but I do agree by and large that once you move over 20% market share in any place you need to start asking yourself if there is enough competition Because competition pushes you to be better. Lack of competition pushes you to sit and

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，例如在**瑞士**，在**UBS**和**Credit Suisse**合并之后，现在是否存在竞争不足的情况？可以说，有些人可能会这样争论，对吧？这又取决于哪个市场细分。因为如果你看整个行业，从零售市场角度来看，也就是个人客户，我认为他们还不错，考虑到他们拥有的所有银行。但当你转向中小型企业和大型企业，也就是企业部门时，竞争水平就会下降，因为**UBS**与**Credit Suisse**合并后的实力太强了。我们欧洲需要更强大的银行来提高欧洲的竞争力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: so is there now too little competition in Switzerland for instance after the merger of **UBS** and **credit space**. Let's say that some people could argue that right uh and it depends again on which market segments because if you take the entire industry uh from a retail market standpoint so individual I think they're okay given all the banks that they have when you start moving on uh small and midcaps and large caps. So the corporate sector that level of competition declines because of how strong uh **UBS** with credit facilities. Do we need stronger banks in Europe to make Europe more competitive?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 听着，我总是用这个比喻：如果我们总是谈论的工业是引擎，那么金融服务、银行和资本市场就是汽油。所以现在欧洲有两件事。第一，它正在努力转型，因为我们从未面临过如此巨大的挑战，无论是在我们行业的结构还是我们产品的领导地位方面。我的意思是，如果你今天去**西班牙**或**意大利**旅行，我会说在**西班牙**，情况非常极端。大多数欧洲汽车制造商的经销商都是空的，而大多数中国汽车制造商的经销商都是满的。所以这对我们欧洲人来说是一个冲击，因为我们曾经在这方面处于领先地位。还有其他行业，**德国**、**意大利**或**法国**以前曾处于领先地位，但现在我们不再拥有了。我们需要改变这一点。除此之外，如果你看过去15年的欧洲，我们一直落后于**美国**和**中国**的增长，我们需要这种增长。所以为了做到这两件事，你需要新的政策，然后你需要为它们融资。我认为有些国家觉得他们可以像以前一样通过政府预算来融资。但政府预算是不够的。他们需要银行、资本市场和我们投资者的杠杆作用，才能实现这种转型和融资。而且我确实认为，目前我们所处的环境、法规和框架不允许我们这样做。**Andrea**，嗯，很多人大学所学专业与工作不对口。你在大学时写的论文是关于**恶意收购**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Look, the the parallel I always use is uh if the industry which we always talk about is the engine financial services, banks and capital markets are the gasoline. So now Europe has two things. one it is trying to transform itself because we have never been faced with such a challenge in terms of the structure of our industry the leadership of our products. I mean, if you go if you travel to Spain today or if you travel to Italy, uh I would say in Spain, it's an extreme. Most car dealers from European producers are empty and most car dealers from Chinese producers are full. And so this for us is a shock as European because we had the leadership in that. And there are other industry where Germany or Italy or France had the leadership before that we don't have anymore. We need to transform that. In addition to that, if you take Europe in the last 15 years, we've been always lagging growth of **US** and uh **China** and uh we need that growth. So in order to do those two things, you need new policies and then you need to finance them. And I think some countries feel that they can finance them as they have done so far through government budgets. But government budgets are not enough. They need the leverage of banks and capital markets and our investors to be able to do that transformation and that financing. And I do think that at the moment the environment, the regulation, the framework in which we operate does not allow us to do that. Andra, um, not many people work with what they studied at university. At university, you wrote your thesis on **hostile takeovers**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我写了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes, I did.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 24年9月，你收购了**Commerzbank**的大量股份。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And in September 24, you acquired a big stake in **Commerce Bank**. Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 这背后的想法是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What was the thinking behind that?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 一直以来都在做同样的事情。也许我没有人们想象的那么有创造力。我就是那些非常幸运的人之一，很早就发现了自己热爱做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: The working for all this time in the same thing. Maybe I'm not as creative as people think. I I am one of those uh very lucky individuals that identified earlier

</details>

**主持人**: 还有收购。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: what they love to do and takeovers.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 不，我会说，嗯，一开始肯定是的。我过去常说，你知道，如果我想成为一个“算账先生”，我就会去管理层，而现在……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: No, I would say well at the beginning for sure I used to say that uh you know if I wanted to be a bean counter I would have gone in management and now

</details>

**主持人**: 我现在就在管理层。但在大学时，我读了很多关于**恶意收购**和对**Nabisco**等公司的攻击，所以我很想做同样的事情。我成功说服了一位非常棒的教授，让我写一篇在**意大利**甚至不被人理解的论文，然后我通过做自己真正想做的事情而成功了。我从未后悔过。但人生会不断演变，你的工作也会演变，这就是我现在的状态。关于**Commerzbank**，我认为有很多问题，通常**M&A**（并购）被视为目的本身。我认为在经历了35年的**M&A**之后，**M&A**可以成为一个极好的工具，来强化公司，使其更上一层楼，但它也可能带来厄运或负面影响，因为你没有以纪律严明的方式进行。**M&A**是你战略的工具。你的战略决定了它是什么。你有一个愿景，一个计划，一个战略，你正在有机地执行它。如果**M&A**符合战略并且以正确的条件进行，它可以加速战略的实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I am in management but uh at university I uh I was reading so much about **hostile takeovers** and the attacks on **Nabiscoco** or all of these things that I wanted to do the same thing. I convinced a professor who was awesome to let me do a thesis on something that in Italy was not even understood and then I got myself through doing exactly what I wanted. I never regretted it. But in life you evolve and then your job evolves and uh that's where I am now. On **commerce bank** I think uh lots of question about that and uh usually **M&A** is viewed like an end on itself. I think after 35 years of **M&A**, **M&A** can be a fantastic tool to strengthen a company to catapult its further, but it can also be a doom or a bad thing because you don't do it in a disciplined fashion. **M&A** is a tool to your strategy. Your strategy decide what it is. You have a vision, you have a plan, you have a strategy, you're doing it organically. **M&A** can accelerate it if it fits and if it's done at the right terms.

</details>

### Commerzbank收购案的策略考量

**主持人**: **Commerzbank**如何融入这一切？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How does **Commerce Bank** fit into all this?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 那么，我该怎么说呢？在宣布我们从**德国**政府手中收购**Commerzbank**著名的5%股权的前夜，这完全符合我们的战略。**德国**，我们相信**德国**。**波兰**。我们希望从客户角度加强该地区。中小企业，这是我们在欧洲的支柱业务。富裕客户也是我们在欧洲的支柱业务。而且，我们觉得我们得到了政府的默许支持，以及当时**Commerzbank**领导层的默许支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So let's say how can I put it? The night before announcing the famous 5% stake that we bought from the German government. It was something that totally fit in our strategy. **Germany**, we believe in **Germany**. **Poland**. We want to strengthen that area from a client standpoint. SMMES, this is our bread and butter across Europe. Affluent bread and butter across Europe. And uh we felt we had implicit support by the government and implicit support by the then leadership of **Commerce Bank**.

</details>

**主持人**: 但第二天早上情况就变了。我们醒来发现世界大不相同。我想我们在这通电话之前讨论过波动性和变化。每天早上你醒来都会发现一个不同的现实。我们发现了一个不同的现实。在那一刻，对我们来说，选择——这是**M&A**的一个特点——是：一、不继续前进，因此逆转方向。我们当时觉得，那将是承认我们做错了什么，而我们不认为我们错了。二、保持现状，随波逐流。三、在不发起竞购的情况下，尽可能多地获取股份，然后坐观其变。我们选择了第三条路，这正是我们在24年底到25年底之间所做的。在我看来，以及我董事会的意见，这取得了成功。今天，这笔股权每年将产生近8亿欧元的税后收入，如果他们按计划执行，并且可能在某个不确定的时期内，有可能将其转化为一项合并，这在我看来将使我们成为欧洲最真正的泛欧洲银行，因为可以说，在**锡**以东，我们将在**德国**、**意大利**、**奥地利**和**VE**各地拥有市场份额和领导地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But that changed in the morning. We woke up to a very different world. I think we were discussing before this call on volatility and change. And every morning you wake up and you find a different reality. We found a different reality. And at that point uh the choice for us and this is one characteristic of **M&A** was one not go forward and therefore reverse course. We felt at the time that that would be an admission that we had done something incorrect and we didn't think we had. two stay as is and bob around or three get to the maximum we could get without launching a bid and then sit and see how the situation would map and we chose the third course that's exactly what we did uh between the end of 24 and the end of 25 in my opinion and in the opinion of my board it has been a success today we that stake will generate close to 800 million uh euros a year post tax growing assuming they make their plan and maybe in an undefined period of time there will be the the possibility to convert that into a combination that would make in my opinion US the most truly panuropean bank in Europe because let's say east of tin would have market share everywhere in leadership across **Germany**, **Italy**, **Austria** and **VE**.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 但**德国**人为什么改变主意了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: But why did the Germans change their mind?

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为有很多原因。你知道，我通常在生活中学会了专注于我能控制的事情，而不是猜测别人会做什么。不过，我想说以下几点。我认为，欧洲发生了很多变化，其中之一就是我们现在几乎总是与**联合政府**打交道。**联合政府**并非铁板一块。这种情况发生在**德国**，也发生在**意大利**。它发生在**西班牙**。我几乎可以举出我活跃的每一个国家为例。它们都是**联合政府**。我想说，我们当时与之交谈的政府部分更加自由和市场友好。而**联合政府**的其余部分则不然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think a number of you know I I usually have learned in life to focus on what I control and not to speculate on what others do. I would say the following though. I think uh one of the things that have changed and many things have changed in Europe is we now almost always deal with **coalitions**. **Coalitions** are not uniform. This happens in **Germany**. It happen in **Italy**. It happens in **Spain**. I can take almost every country that I am activist. They're **coalition**. And I would say that the part of the government that we were talking to at the time was much more liberal and market friendly. The rest of the **coalition** was less.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 也许在政府内部，他们的立场不如人们想象的那么一致。当一切尘埃落定，并且有很多关于它的讨论时，他们以多数票通过了一个与任何一方立场相反的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And maybe within the government, they were less aligned than one would have thought. And when everything came to bear and there was a lot of noise about it, they took at majority uh a position that was against the position of what anyone's side

</details>

**主持人**: 已经采取的立场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: had taken visavas.

</details>

### Banco BPM竞购与未来银行模式

**Andrea Orcel**: 然后，不久之后，你对**Banco BPM**发起了竞购。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And then um quite soon afterwards you launched a bid for **Banko BPM**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我们做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes, we did.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以，你是一个拳击手。同时与两个人搏击有意义吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So uh you're a boxer. Uh does it make sense to box against two people at the same time?

</details>

**主持人**: 对我们来说，有两件事，或者说有以下考虑。第一个考虑是，当**BPM**出现时，我们坚信，虽然我们会将我们的衍生品和其他一切转换为30%的股权，但我们不会在可预见的未来对**Commerzbank**发起竞购。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: uh for us it was there were two things or or the following consideration. The first consideration is that by the time **BPM** emerged, we were absolutely convinced that while we would convert our derivatives and everything else into a 30% stake,

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以当时虽然有所有关于达到30%并转换股权的财务规划，但没有整合，没有工业上的东西，我们只是作为财务参与者。所以这不是与两个人搏击，而是与一个人搏击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: we would not launch a bid in **Commerce Bank** in the foreseeable future. M so while there was all the financial planning of getting to 30% and converting the stakes there was no integration nothing industrial we would just sit on a financial participation so it wasn't boxing with two it was boxing with one

</details>

**主持人**: 然后我们说，如果现在我们发起**BPM**，等到我们完成交易并整合它，我们将能够进行第二次。因为在**意大利**，与**德国**不同，我们觉得我们显然我们的评估没有实现。我们会在9个月内完成交易，11个月内整合。这在**意大利**。这是**UniCredit**的优势之一。我们在13个市场活跃。所以有13个法律实体，13个董事会和所有的一切。所以**意大利**的领导团队会管理，其他12个市场甚至不会注意到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and then so we said if actually if now we launch **BPM** by the time we close the transaction and then we integrate it we will be able to go on the second Because in **Italy** differently from **Germany** we felt we would obviously our evaluation did not come true. We would close the transaction in 9 months integrated in 11 and it was in **Italy**. This is one of the advantages of **UniCredit**. We are active in 13 markets. So 13 legal entities, 13 boards and 13 everything. So the Italian leadership team would run the other 12 markets would not even notice

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 并且，如果条件合适，我们就可以在另一个市场，与另一个团队，在另一个框架下，与你所说的第二个拳击手搏击，这是可能的。所以，第一点是这个，第二点坦率地说，是股东们，我们不能至少不尝试参与**意大利**的整合，这是我们的两个主要市场之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and sequentially if the condition were then right we would be able to box the second boxer as you call it uh in another market with another team with another framework and that was possible. So one it was that two it was frankly shareholders we could not not at least try to participate in Italian consolidation which is one of our two main markets

</details>

**主持人**: 如果它正在进行，而我们只是说，好吧，因为我忙于其他事情，我没有做这个，市场已经在我之外整合了，至少我们需要尝试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: uh if it was going on and just say well because I'm busy there I haven't done that and the market has consolidated away from me at least we needed to try

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 因此我们尝试了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and therefore we tried

</details>

**主持人**: 所以这些就是当时的情况。我们已经等了三年半，财务条款也符合。所以我们可以进行一笔交易，即使我们当时重新评估了溢价，我们也可以将其引入，并对我们的股东说，好吧，从战略上讲，你知道，这是因为你一直希望我这样做，而且从条款上看，投资回报率可以达到15%，这在当时比我的股票回购高出约两个百分点，以调整风险，并且它会加强我们在**意大利**的业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and so these were the And at the time and we had waited for three and a half years the terms the financial terms were aligned. So we could do a transaction which at the time even if we reviewed up for premium we could bring in and look at our shareholder and say well strategically you know it is because you always wanted me to do it and term-wise it could return on investment 15% which at the time was about two points above my share back to adjust for risks and it would strengthen our business in **Italy**.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以这就是我们引入它的原因。当你展望未来时，我们还需要银行以目前的形式存在吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So that that's why we brought it in. When you look into the future, do we need banks in their current forms?

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为正如我们一开始所说，银行将会演变，所以会发生一些变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think as we started with this, banks will morph so takes take some some uh move into what

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 也就是说，商业模式正在改变，我们做生意的方式正在改变。嗯，用财务术语来说，也许10年前，你看到一家银行，商业银行，传统银行，50%的成本收入比。它们很稳健，很好。12%到13%的股本回报率。它们很稳健，很好。今天，同样的条件，成本收入比会是40%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: into so let's say that the business model changing uh the way we do business is changing. um translated in financial terms. Maybe 10 years ago, you saw a bank, commercial banks, legacy bank, 50% uh cost income ratio. They're solid. They're good. 12, 13% return on equity. They're solid. They're good. Today, the same terms would be 40. In my opinion, if you 40% cost income ratio and

</details>

**主持人**: 这意味着你40%的成本……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: that means that the cost of 40% of your

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 这意味着我40%的收入是成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: those mean that cost of 40% of my income

</details>

**主持人**: 股本回报率大约是12%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and the return on equity which was about 12%.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为今天你需要有抱负达到高十位数，比如18%等等。所以，如果你想积极地看待这个行业，它正变得更具吸引力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think today you need to have an ambition to be in the high teens so 18s etc etc. So the industry if you want to look at it positively is becoming more appealing

</details>

**主持人**: 但这需要重新思考你的做事方式。如果你不坐享其成，继续沿用50年前、30年前、20年前的商业模式，你就需要重新思考组织、流程、工作方式、技术、**AI**，并不断改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but it requires rethinking how you do things. If you're not sitting back and continuing to operate on the business model you did 50 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, you need to rethink the organization, the process, the way of working, the technology, the **AI** and change and change and change.

</details>

### 客户体验与AI驱动的转型

**Andrea Orcel**: 那么，当你审视**UniCredit**，在你的小木屋里思考10年后的**UniCredit**时，它会是什么样子？它会变成什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So when you then take **UniCredit** and you sit in your chalet and you think about **UniCredit** 10 years from now, just what what does it look like? What is it?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，如果你从客户的角度来看，暂时以个人和家庭为例。我总是对我们的人说，如果你在**Netflix**或我们习惯使用的其他平台上观看节目，然后因为某种原因你需要关闭它，转到你的银行应用。你是否能获得相同的体验？因为如果你不能，你将在五年内无法生存。所以客户体验需要演变为我们现在生活中许多其他方面认为的必需品、标准和期望。这需要我们彻底重新思考我们的运营方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, if you look at it from a client standpoint, and for a second, let me take individuals, families, uh I always say that to uh our people. If you have a session on **Netflix** or on some other of those platform that we're so accustomed to be on and then for any reason you need to switch off that and move on your bank. Do you have the same experience? Because if you don't you will not survive in five years. So the client experience need to evolve to what now in many other facets of our life we consider the requirement the bar the expectation and that requires a complete rethink of the way we operate

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 特别是关于，告诉我们你将如何改变它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: especially on the tell us how you're going to change it

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我认为，嗯，我认为这是一步一步来的。显然，银行是受监管的，我不能随意改变，它需要合理，监管机构需要批准。但例如，在我看来，你知道，你开始时，每个人都说他们这样做，但他们没有。客户需要处于核心位置，你需要颠覆组织。这就是我们所做的。客户需要真正成为你所做一切的中心。所以当你思考如何为客户办理入职，当你思考如何向客户发放贷款时，你需要首先思考客户会如何对此做出反应。我给你一个非常具体的例子。消费金融。你走进一家商店，想在**UniCredit**购买一些东西。如果之前没有预批准，而我们没有预批准很多人，那将需要七天。这是一种有效支持客户的方式吗？不是。今天，它只需要13分钟。如果你之前没有获得批准，而我们大多数客户都是预批准的，所以它不需要13分钟。他们知道自己的限额。他们可以消费，然后离开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: so I think um I think it's block by block so obviously banks are regulated I can't just change it needs to make sense the regulator needs to approve it But for instance, in my opinion, you know, you start and everybody says they do that, but they don't. The client needs to be at the you need to flip the organization. That's what we did. The client needs to really be at the center of everything you do. So when you think about the way you do a an onboarding of a client, when you think about how you grant a loan to a client, you need to start by thinking how will the client react to that. I'll give you a very example example. Consumer finance. You go in a shop, you want to buy something at **UniCredit**. Uh if you were not preapproved, and we didn't pre-approve many people, it would take seven days. Is that an effective way to support a client? It's not. Today, it takes 13 minutes. If you're not approved before, and most of our clients are pre-approved before, so it doesn't take 13 minutes. They know their limit. They can spend and they can go.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 为了做到这一点，这意味着我原来有23个步骤的流程需要变成两个。我的信用模型需要一直在线，以评估特定客户群体的风险等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: In order to do that, it means my process which was 23 steps needs to become two. My credit models needs to be online all the time to assess the risk of that particular client segment etc.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的产品需要针对他们想要的东西，我需要能够快速做出反应，否则我虽然可以做得很快，但一切都会在后台崩溃。为了做到这一点，我们对消费金融的整个思考方式已经彻底改变。这花了我们三年时间。同样的情况也将适用于抵押贷款。例如，作为客户，你不需要在七分钟内得到答复。但你确实希望在一周内得到答复。如果你真的想买房，你希望在合理的时间内知道你是否有融资，以便行动。我可以将这些结合起来。让我再举一个例子。我给你七分钟的消费贷款，我知道你从哪里消费，你正在购买去**埃及**的旅行。我是否为你提供航班保险，或者一般的旅行保险？我是否在我的客户——所有超市连锁店或其他地方——为你提供折扣，让你买到，我不知道，靴子或合适的休闲服？我能做到吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: My product needs to be targeted to what they want and I need to be in a position to react that quickly because otherwise I can do it fast but everything will blow up at the back. In order to do that, the entire thinking of how we do consumer finance has changed top to bottom. It has taken us three years. And the same will apply to mortgages. Mortgages, for example, you as a client, you don't need an answer in seven minutes. But you do want an answer in a week. If you are really keen to buy a house, you want to know if you have a financing or not in a reasonable period of time to move. And I can combine that. Let me see another one. I give your consumer loan seven minutes and I know from where you're spending that you're buying a trip to **Egypt**. Do I offer you uh flight insurance, travel insurance in general? Do I offer you discount at my um at my clients who are all supermarket chains or whatever to get I don't know boots or the right casual wear do can I do that

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 因为如果我能做到，那么我就资助了你的梦想，并且我正在向你建议其他事情来完善体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: because if I can do that then I have financed your dream and I am suggesting to you other things to close the experience.

</details>

**主持人**: **AI**将如何进一步改变这一切？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How will **AI** uh change this further?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，**AI**通过加速事物来改变这一切。所以，首先，**AI**的作用，也是每个人都在关注的，就是它极大地降低了成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Well, **AI** changes that accelerating things. So, number one, what **AI** does and this is what everybody's focused on is it reduces cost massively.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，我给你举一个例子。但是，你现在已经看到了吗，还是说它还在路上？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, I'll give you one example. But, but are you seeing that already or is it still to come?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我想说实话，尤其是在欧洲，我不在美国。大多数银行，除了极少数例外，如果你在24年底问这个问题，他们会告诉你一些关于**AI**的事情，但现实是那只是一种好奇。如果你今天或25年底问他们，他们都会谈论它，他们都知道这是一个非常非常关键的项目，但现在的问题是如何驾驭它。你在许多地方看到的第一反应是，我一直在读到，我给我的每个员工都配备了**Copilot**，我让每个人都去参加了一个课程，我做了这些，但这种**AI**虽然会让你的员工生活更轻松，但它是否改变了你的工作方式，是否正在转型并提取协同效应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think what I would say honestly certainly for Europe I'm not in the US most banks with very very very few exception if any if you ask that question in at the end of 24 they would tell you something about **AI** but the reality is it was a curiosity if you ask them today or at the end of 25 they all talk about it they all know it's a big big critical item but now the question is how do we harness it and the first reaction that you see in many places is and I read it all the time I gave **co-pilot** to every one of my employees I sent everybody to a course I did this but that **AI** while it will make the life of your employee easier is that changing the way you work and is that transforming and extracting synergies

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，这就是我想说的。所以现在有些银行，有些银行走在我们前面，但我们正在努力快速追赶。所以如果你看一份信用档案，非常简单。你是一家大公司。你想要我们的贷款。我需要从你的账户、从互联网、从许多来源收集信息。创建一个信用档案，所有这些数据，将其重新分类到我的电子表格中，然后应用我的指标，告诉你你是否符合条件。我正在简化，但就是这样。通常，一个经验丰富的信贷员需要六周时间才能从零到完成，如果所有数据都可用的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, that's what I wanted to say. So now some banks and some are ahead of us, but we're trying to catch up quickly. So if you look at a credit file, very simple. You're a big company. You want a loan from us. I need to gather information from your accounts, from the internet, from a number of sources. create a credit file, all of that data, reclassify it into my spreadsheets, and then apply my metrics and tell you if you fit or if you don't. I'm simplifying, but that's that. Usually, it takes six weeks for one experienced credit officer to do that from zero to the to the end if all the data is available.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我们与我们的一个合作伙伴一起做了一个试点。我们开发了一个**AI**引擎来做同样的事情。我们花了一周时间开发这个引擎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: We did a pilot together with one of our partners. We developed an **AI** engine to do the same. It took us one week to develop the engine.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们可以在14分钟内完成我们花了六周时间准备的文件，准确率达到98%。这是第一次试验。它会很快达到100%。所以这告诉你什么？它告诉你，如果我处理银行的信贷流程，80%甚至90%的大型企业员工都在准备文件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And they could do on one where we had taken six week to prepare the fire. They could do it in 14 minutes with 98% accuracy. And this is the first trial. It will become 100% very very quickly. So what does that tell you? It tells you that if I take the credit process of a bank 80% if not 90% of the people in the large caps prepare files.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 那么你打算怎么做？因为现在你要淘汰90%的人，工作方式会改变，你需要在许多我所在的国家管理社会影响，如果我不对他们进行再培训，我就不能这样做。所以这是一个渐进的过程。那么你该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So what are you going to do? Because now what are you eliminating 90% of the people the way of working changes you need to manage the social impact in many countries where I am I cannot do that if I don't reskill them. So it's progressive. So what do you do

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，例如，我们从22年底开始设立了一个风险修复部门。通常，我们有大约，嗯，从那时起，我们已经处理了大约650到700人，他们不是要离开，而是优秀的专业人士，但他们的领域正在被去中介化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and so it's that so for example we have since 22 end of 22 started a risk healing unit usually we have about well since then we've done about 650 700 people were people that are not leaving but that are good professional but just their areas are getting disintermediated

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 那么你将他们再培训去做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: so what do you reskill them to do

</details>

**主持人**: 转移到我们需要更多人的其他领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: to move to other to other things where we need more of them

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为，例如，在我看来，银行对客户的人性化接触已经削减得太多了。所以，我可能希望一切都在线上完成，但如果我申请25万的抵押贷款，我希望看到一个真人坐在我面前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I I think for example in my opinion banks have curtailed too much the human touch to the client. So I may want everything online but if I'm taking a mortgage of 250k I want to see a person in front of me.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么你认为银行普遍不会像人们想象的那样大幅降低成本吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So do you think banks generally will not reduce cost as much as people think?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为，如果你在五六年内不这样做，你就会消失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think I think if you don't in five or six years you're not here.

</details>

**主持人**: 你能让人们像你预期的那样快速改变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you get people to change as quickly as you thought they would change?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，我对**UniCredit**感到惊喜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Uh I have been pleasantly surprised at **uni credit**.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 但这并不是说你登上讲台，做一场可能由某个非常聪明的顾问为你准备的演讲。你滔滔不绝地讲了一个小时，然后走下讲台，他们就会照做。事情不是那样运作的。首先，你需要让他们认识到，无论有没有他们，这都会发生。所以选择是，如果我们一开始就做，我们就有时间重新培训你，我们有时间改变，我们可以管理我们的节奏。如果你等到撞墙，你就会流落街头，因为这迟早会发生。它正在发生。一旦你有了这种信念，那么你如何管理，以及管理多长时间，才能最好地平衡速度足够快，但另一方面又不做工会和老实说社会不允许你做的事情。那么这能做到吗？我认为可以做到。我们在**UniCredit**一次又一次地做到了，而且我发现，随着时间的推移，如果你提供替代方案，并且你正确对待员工，结果会比人们预期的更积极。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: But but it is I it is not you get on a podium, you do a presentation that probably some very intelligent consultant has prepared for you. You pontificate for an hour and then you step off and they're all going to do it. It doesn't work that way. Firstly, you need to co-opt them in realizing that this is going to happen with them or without them. So the choice is if we do it at the beginning, we have time to reskill you, we have time to change and we can manage our pace. If you wait to hit the wall, you're all on the street because this is happening one way or the other. It is happening. Once you have that conviction, then how do you manage and over how long in order to be able to manage at best the balance between being fast enough but on the other hand not doing things that trade unions and honestly society will not allow you to do. So can that be done? I think it can be done. We have done it again and again at **Uni Credit** and uh I find that over time if you provide alternatives and if you treat people correctly the outcome is more positive than people expect.

</details>

### 稳定币与金融市场趋势

**主持人**: 我们看到的另一个技术变革当然是**稳定币**、**区块链**等等。这将如何融入你的业务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Another technology change we are um seeing is of course **stable coins**, **blockchain** and so on. Just where how is that going to fit into your business?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，你知道，如果你三年前问我，我可能会说我真的不知道。今天，我认为我们……我认为这是一个优先事项。我认为如果你看市场的现代化，无论是债券、股票、抵押贷款合同，还是其他什么，它都只是技术上的改变，消除了中间商，这就是**区块链**。嗯，你需要参与其中。另一件事是，如果你在**区块链**上，你需要一种支付方式，它要么是加密货币，我们只在客户需要时才参与，因为我们认为它对我们这样的商业银行来说过于投机。所以我们支持它，但我们不使用它。**稳定币**之所以重要，根本原因在于它更加稳定。这就是为什么我们加入了欧洲银行的一个联盟**Kalis**，以推出基于欧元的**稳定币**，因为这是目前欧洲面临的另一个威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Well, you know, if you had asked me three years ago, I would have said you I don't really know. Today, I think we are I think it is a priority. I think if you look at the modernization of markets, is it uh bonds? Is it equity? Is it contracts for mortgages? Is it this? It's just a change in technology eliminating intermediaries **blockchain**. That's what it is. Uh you need to be at it. And uh the other thing is if you're on **blockchain**, you need a means of payment and it's either a cryptocurrency which we only get involved to the extent that our clients want to do it because we are not we think it's too speculative for a commercial bank like us. So we support it but we're not using it. **Stable coin** is is fundamentally because it is a lot more stable. That's why we join a um a consortium of banks in Europe, **Kalis** to launch **stable coin** for based on euros because that's another threat for Europe

</details>

**主持人**: 目前。如果你看**稳定币**，只有**美元**。所以这意味着如果你使用**区块链**，你需要一种支付方式，你就有可能被**美元**完全去中介化。而美国人喜欢**稳定币**，因为支持它们的是**美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: at the moment. If you look at **stable coin** only **US dollar** so that would mean that if you go on **blockchain** and you need a means of payment, you're risking to be completely disinterminated by **US dollar**. And the Americans love **stable coin** because what is backing them is the dollar

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 还有**美国国债**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and **US treasuries**.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么我们什么时候能拥有欧洲**稳定币**呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And when will we when will we have a European **stable coin**?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我们计划在今年第三季度推出第一个**稳定币**，这意味着它将投入使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: We are aiming to be out with a first **stable coin**, meaning that it's working. Um by the third quarter of this year.

</details>

**主持人**: 金融市场还有其他让你紧张或担忧的趋势吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What are the any other trends in financial markets which um make you nervous or worried?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 不，我确实认为可能有一件事，我们一开始就讨论过。嗯，如果你经历过，比如说，**疫情前**的时代，尤其是在欧洲，你谈论的是稳定的低利率。你谈论的是风险成本，也就是违约率非常低，因为利率非常低。你谈论的是非常有限的通货膨胀，甚至没有通货膨胀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: No, I I do think maybe one things and we were discussing it at the beginning. Um if you come from having lived uh let's say the **pre-COVID** area especially in Europe, you're talking stable interest rates and low you're talking cost of risk so default which are very low because interest rate are so low that they are very low. You're talking very limited to no inflation.

</details>

**主持人**: 你可以展望未来三年，并且很容易地在预测方面保持在一个标准差之内。所以你制定预算，将预算分解成小块，你有流程，你告诉每个人该做什么，然后你跟踪。而今天，情况恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're talking you can look at the next three years and very easily we be within one standard deviation in terms of projection. So you budget you break down the budget in pieces you have processes you tell everybody what to do and you track that today diametrically opposite.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我记得我们在2021年12月推出了**UniCredit Unlocked**。我们的股价反应非常积极，这是一个非常详细的计划。我们花了九个月才完成。一个月后，**俄罗斯**入侵**乌克兰**，整个计划付诸东流，从那时起一直如此。嗯，我们有波动的利率，波动的地缘政治，以及正在改变我们工作方式的技术和**AI**。我们所做的所有假设，第二天早上醒来就变了，因为我们看到了意想不到的新事物。所以现在在我看来，要经营一家公司，要参与竞争，你需要了解总体的方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I remember that we did uh we launched **Uni Credit Unlocked** in December 2021. Our stock price reacted very positively, very detailed plan. It had taken us nine months to do it. A months later, **Russia** invaded **Ukraine** and the entire plan went in the bin and since then is the same. Uh we have interest rates which are volatile, geopolitics that are volatile, technology and **AI** that are changing the way we work. All the assumption that we make we wake up the next morning and they are changing because we see new things that we didn't expect. So now in my opinion to run a company to compete you need to understand what is the general direction of travel

</details>

**主持人**: 并且对你的组织从上到下有一个深刻的理解，了解你的愿景、战略、计划和那个方向，这样这些子团队，无论是国家还是国家内的子集，零售、企业等等，都可以不断适应和调整最初的计划，以达到相同的方向，但要适应不断变化的环境。管理风格是截然相反的，因为你不断地观察他们是如何调整的，并看它是否朝着正确的方向发展，而不是监控他们是否正在应用你最初认为他们会应用的东西。这种调整绝对至关重要，除非我们周围的波动性下降，而我不认为它会下降。我认为这是一种完全不同的运作方式，如果你不这样做，后果将非常严重。但要做到这一点，赋权水平、信任水平、将你的个人凝聚在一起的文化，以及对我们走向何方、为何走向何方以及他们可以使用的杠杆的理解，以及你的机构对他们即使在给定的指标范围内失败也没关系的舒适感，他们只需要标记出来，重新组合并重新开始，而不是我会惩罚你，这是巨大的。这对于非常僵化的银行来说，是一个非常困难的文化转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and uh have such a deep understanding across your organization top to bottom of what is your vision, your strategy, your plan and that direction of travel that these sub teams be country or subset in countries retail corporate etc can constantly adapt and rejig what was the original plan to get to the same direction but adapting to a changing environment. And the style of management is diametrically opposite because you're constantly looking at how they have adjusted and seeing if it's going in the right direction rather than monitoring if they are applying what you thought they would apply at the beginning. And that adjustment is absolutely critical and unless the volatility we see around us goes down and I don't think it does I think this is a complete different way of running things and if you don't do that the repercussion are very difficult but to do that the level of empowerment the level of trust the culture that gels together your individuals and the understanding of where we're going why we're going and what are the levers that they can use and the comfort of your institution that if they fail within staying in the metrics you gave them, it's okay. They just need to flag it, regroup and start rather than I'm going to penalize you is massive. And this is a cultural shift that for banks which are very sclerotic is very difficult to do.

</details>

### 韧性与领导力原则

**Andrea Orcel**: 韧性在你的生活中有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: How important is **grit** in your life?

</details>

**主持人**: 非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Very important.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 这可能是我一直以来信仰的核心。我认为有些人，并非人人平等。有些人天生比其他人更有天赋，我们每天都能看到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: It is probably at the essence of what I have always uh believed. I I think some people not everybody's equal. Some people are born more gifted than others and we see that every day.

</details>

**主持人**: 但总的来说，我认为在许多情况下，我会说在大多数情况下，达到一定水平的人，也许不是班上最有才华的人……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But by and large uh I think that in a number of situation I would say in a majority of situation people that are at a certain level maybe not the most talented in the class

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 他们学习，他们失败并学习如何处理失败。他们学习如何从失败中学习，如何重新振作，以及如何继续前进。我认为我们分享，我认为我们分享，我认为我们分享一本最喜欢的书，**Angela Duckworth**的《**Grit**》。绝对是，我们确实邀请了**Angela Duckworth**参加播客，所以是的，你听过它，我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: that learn that fail and learn how to deal with failure. They learn how to learn from failure, how to pick themsel back up and how to go further. I think we share I think we share I think we share a favorite book **grit** by **Angela Duckworth** and absolutely and we did have **Angela Duckworth** on the podcast so yeah so you listen to it I think

</details>

**主持人**: 你的韧性是从哪里开始的？你的韧性是从哪里开始的？你的成长环境并不特别艰苦，对吧？我的意思是，你是一个中产阶级的人，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: where did you where did you where did **grit** where did **grit** start for you what was your you didn't have a particular hard upbringing right I mean you were a middle-ass kind of guy right

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我，我，嗯，首先，我经历了**法国高中**的教育，直到今天，**法国高中**仍然非常注重理性，而且教学风格，我不知道现在如何，但在我那个时代，它非常严苛，你需要赢得你在那个座位上的位置，因此它教会你重新振作并做得更好，否则你无法在这种教学风格下生存。但总的来说，它很适合我，为什么呢？因为，嗯，我相信不可能的事情是可能的。有人告诉我，要么不可能的事情在完成之前都是不可能的，要么如果它不可能，那就更有创造力，你就会让它成为可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I I well first of all I went I went through the **French Lay** and still today the **French leay** is very cartisian and the style of teaching I don't know today but in my times it was very hard you needed to deserve the place you had at that chair at that desk and uh and therefore it taught you to regroup and do better because otherwise you wouldn't survive that kind of style of teaching but in general it suits me why because um I believe that the impossible is possible somebody told me uh either where the impossible is impossible until it's done or if it's impossible be more creative and you will make it possible

</details>

**主持人**: 而且，嗯，我认为人类在这里是为了提升自己。而韧性告诉我，我可能起步落后，但通过决心、韧性、坚持不懈、不把挑战或挫折视为灾难的能力。这并不意味着你不会反应糟糕。你会的。但随后在某个时刻说：“好吧，它发生了。为什么会发生？”把自己拉出来，重新开始。你进化了，你在你决心做的任何事情上都成为了一个更好的人。对我来说，经历这种生活并思考，如果我有决心，如果我真的想要它，如果我为此努力，我将能够通过大量的努力达到目标，那么这是一段值得经历的旅程。对我来说，这是我信仰的许多事情的基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and um I think human beings are here to improve themselves and **grit** is what tells me that I may start behind but through determination, resilience, consistency, ability to not take a challenge or setback as a disaster. That does not mean you don't react badly. You do. But then at some point say, "Right, it happened. Why did it happen?" Pull yourself out, start again. You evolve and you become a much better individual in whatever you set your mind to do. And for me going through this life and thinking if I'm determined if I really want it, if I work at it, I will be able to get there with a lot of effort but I will then it's a journey that is worth going through. And that's for me it's at the base of a lot of things that I believe.

</details>

### 多语言能力与思维方式

**Andrea Orcel**: 你会说大多数欧洲语言，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: You speak uh most of the European languages,

</details>

**主持人**: 不会德语，但我会葡萄牙语。我妻子是葡萄牙人。至少我明白你会告诉我我说的**西班牙语**是它的派生词，但我确实会说**西班牙语**。我确实会说**法语**、**意大利语**、**英语**，还有一点点**葡萄牙语**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: not German, but I do Portuguese. My wife is Portuguese. At least I understand that you would tell me that I speak a der a derivative of Spanish, but I do speak Spanish. I do speak French, Italian, English, and a little bit of Portuguese.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 你，嗯，这种泛欧洲的地方，它是什么？它对你的思维有什么影响？你认为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: What do you um this kind of uh uh kind of panuropean uh uh places? What is it? What does it do to your thinking? You think

</details>

**主持人**: 这实际上很有趣，我妻子和女儿总是指出这一点。我仍然用**法语**数数。如果有一个数学问题，或者我需要关联事物，我大声说出来以听到自己的逻辑，那总是**法语**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it's actually quite interesting and u my wife and my daughter always point that out. I still count in **French**. If there is a mathematical problem or I need to correlate things and I speak loud to hear myself on the logic, it's always **French**.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我用**英语**做演示，因为我在这里已经35年了，所以我的整个职业生涯都是如此。也许我喜欢我的生活，嗯，喜欢在度假时用**西班牙语**交流。所以它们标志着我生活的不同方面，它们共同塑造了我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I do presentation in **English** because I've been here for 35 years and therefore all my professional life has been that uh maybe I enjoy my life and uh enjoy communicating in **Spanish** when I am on holidays. So they have marked different aspects of my life and they they shape what I am altogether.

</details>

### 领导者特质与工作生活平衡

**主持人**: 你有什么样的性格或心理？这来源于哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What kind of temperament or psyche do you have? Where is that from?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 啊，你可能可以称之为坚定，你可以称之为抱负，你可以称之为功能失调。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Ah you can probably you can call it determined you can call it ambition you can call it dysfunctional.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，对我来说，其中一部分是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um for me what parts of it is

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为对我来说就是这样。例如，很多人一直问我工作与生活平衡的问题，我认为这种说法……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think for me it's that. So for example, a lot of people kept on asking me what about work life balance and I think that statement uh assumes that work is bad and you need something else.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Totally.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 而且，嗯，如果我正在做我选择的工作，与我喜欢的人一起，并且我正在经历一段令人兴奋的旅程，那几乎就像不是工作一样。我实际上正在享受与我一起做这件事的人的旅程。所以我自然会倾向于更多的工作，而且我确实认为这些事情在生活中也会发生变化。所以如果你在我25岁时认识我，是的，我工作很多。嗯，今天我仍然工作很多，但因为我有一个15岁的女儿，我的重心已经转移了。所以对我来说，这种工作与生活平衡是一种选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And uh if I am doing the job I chose with the people I like and I am on a journey that is exciting, it's almost like it's not work. I'm actually enjoying the journey with the people I'm doing it. So I will naturally tilt towards more work and I do think that also these things move in life. So if you had known me when I was 25, yes I was working a lot. Uh today I'm still working a lot but because I have a daughter who is 15, my priority has moved. So this work life balance for me is choices.

</details>

**主持人**: 但什么叫“很多”？什么叫“工作很多”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But what is lot what is a lot? What's what is it to work a lot?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，我想当我25岁的时候，我仍然经历了**美国投资银行**的“魔鬼训练营”，那时如果你一周不熬夜三次，在分析师的几年里不休任何假，并且一周工作六天甚至七天，那么你就没有通过训练营。我不认为那一定是正确的做法。你真的让你的员工更努力工作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Well, I think when when I was uh I still went through the boot camp of **investment banks** in the **US** when I was 25 where if you weren't doing three allnighters a week, did not take any holidays in your analyst years and weren't working six if not seven days a week. It was you were not through the boot camp at the end. I don't think that that's necessarily the right thing to do. Do you work your people really harder?

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为让你的员工真的努力工作。我不相信我所认为的是因为我工作非常努力，所以我拖着他们。所以我认为，嗯，如果你问他们中的许多人，当他们需要时间时，我很多次让他们休息，我是第一个永远不会打电话给他们或要求任何事情的人。但我确实认为，如果我们一起踏上旅程，并且我们正在努力到达那里，而他们看到我全身心投入，他们也会选择全身心投入。现在你可能会说，“是的，但全身心投入，你是在拖着他们。”我理解这一点。所以在某种程度上，我有责任看看其他人是否走得太远。我会阻止它。但我不要求人们在某个时间点在办公室，或者在另一个时间点。对我来说，有一项任务要完成。我们都在一起做。你做这部分，我做那部分。让我们完成它。对你来说，在某种程度上被喜欢重要吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think the work your people really hard. I don't believe what I think is because I work really hard I drag them. So I think u and if you ask many of them when they need time and many times I ask them to take time I am the first person who will never pick up the phone to to call them or to ask for anything. But I do think that if we are on a journey together and we're trying to get there and they see that I am allin, they choose to be allin. Now you could say, "Yeah, but by being all in, you're dragging them." I understand that. So to an extent, it is my responsibility to see if some others are going too far. And I stop it. But I don't demand people to be at a certain time in the office onto another time. For me, there is a task to be done. We're all doing it together. you're doing this part, I'm doing that part. Let's get it done. Is it important for you to be liked to an extent?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为，嗯，我认为有你，尤其当你担任更负责任的职位或更具领导力的职位时。嗯，保持脚踏实地非常重要，并且每天提醒自己，你没有什么不同。你只是扮演着不同的角色。但同时，你需要公平对待他人，因为你拥有他们不具备的权力，你需要真正思考——我强迫自己这样做——如果这件事发生在我身上，我会怎么想，嗯，不要轻视它。所以我们谈到了**M&A**。**M&A**在这种背景下具有完全不同的意义。当你25岁时，你在做电子表格，那只是数字。当你62岁时，你在评估如何对待员工，那完全是不同的事情。但我确实认为，不幸的是，生活是不公平的，不幸的是，生活是艰难的，如果你领导一个组织，你需要为了集体利益做出决定，而不是因为并非所有人都认为这些决定是正确的而拒绝做出决定，这是错误的。我确实相信，而且我一次又一次地看到，即使是那些不同意你的人，也更喜欢在你听取了所有人的意见之后说，好吧，这次我听取了所有人的意见。就是这样，我们将朝着这个方向前进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think uh I think there are you and especially when you get in more uh responsible positions or more leadership position. Uh it is very important to keep your feet on the ground and and remind you every day that you're no different. You're just having a different role. But at the same time and you need to be fair to people because you wield power that they don't have and you need to really think which I what I force myself to do uh how would I feel if that was done to me and uh not dismiss it. So we talked about **M&A**. **M&A** takes a completely different meaning in that context. When you are 25 years old and you're doing a spreadsheet it's numbers. when you are 62 and you're evaluating what you're going to do with people, it's a completely different things to do. But I do think that unfortunately life is not fair and unfortunately life is tough and if you're leading an organization there are decision you need to make in the collective interest and not taking those decision because not everybody thinks that they are the right decision is wrong and I do believe and I have seen it again and again and again that even the people who disagree with you prefer that having listened to everybody you said right I listen to everybody this time. This is it and we're going in that direction.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，对你来说，被喜欢并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, it's not important for you to be liked.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 不，不是你定义的那种方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: No, not in the way you define it.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么在很多情况下，我希望被喜欢。嗯，你以多种方式挑战了传统观念，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Then I would love to be liked in many cases. Um, you challenge the establishment in many ways, right?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我不知道你是否能这么说。我，我，我会说，对我来说，另一件重要的事情是，而且在我完成这份工作时已经发生过一次，嗯，我希望能够回顾过去，没有任何遗憾，这意味着我是否尽我所能，并且当时我认为正确地做了最好的事情，为了我的组织，为了它是什么，我是否因此留下了一个更好的组织？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I don't know if you can say that. I I would I would say more that for me the other thing that is important and it happened to be already once when I am through with this job. uh I want to be in a position to look back and don't have any regret and that means have I done everything that I could and I thought right at the time

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我想，我想，我想如果我们看你到目前为止的业绩，当你五年前成为CEO时，股价是8，今天已经70了，你还支付了7的股息，所以是10倍。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: to do the best by my organization by what it is and did I leave a better organization as a result and so well I think I think I think if we look at your results so far when you became CEO 5 years ago share price was eight and today is 70 and you paid seven in dividends so 10 times Yes.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以这简直是太出色了，对吧？嗯……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So that's like totally outstanding, right? Um

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。但我想告诉你一件事。如果你看看团队，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes. But I would tell you one thing. If you look at the team,

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 那么**UniCredit**每天的69,000名员工，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: so the 69,000 people that are **uni credit** every day,

</details>

**主持人**: 他们为之而生，为之而呼吸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: they live and breathe that.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以这几乎就像是让他们找回了自豪感。当他们对客户说，你知道吗，谢谢你，因为我正在用从**UniCredit**获得的股息来资助我的假期。他们非常渴望与客户进行这种互动。所以有一个因素不仅仅是绩效，而是这种绩效在双方成就方面的意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They're so it's almost like this gave them back their pride. When they talk to client who say, you know what, thank you because I'm financing my holidays with the dividends that I'm getting from **Uni Credit**. they're riveted to have that kind of interaction with a client. So there is an element that is not just performance is what that performance mean in terms of achievement both sides.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 你是从哪里学到这些的？因为你曾在**高盛**、**BCG**、**美林**、**UBS**等公司工作过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Where did you learn this? Because you've been working at places like **Goldman's**, **BCG**, **Maril Lynch**, **UBS**.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，告诉我们你是如何让一家银行增长10倍的？

<details>
<summary>主持人**: So tell us where did you learn to make a bank go up 10 times?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，我想你回到……如果你非常专注，甚至痴迷于卓越是什么样子，以及如何达到卓越，这是第一点。第二点是，如果你愿意倾听那些比你懂得多得多的人。所以我来到**UniCredit**。我作为顾问为商业银行工作了35到40年，但我不是商业银行家。我是投资银行家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Uh I think you go back to if you are very focused if not obsessive on what does excellence look like and how do I get there number one. Number two if you are ready to listen to people who know a lot more than you do. So I arrived at **Uni Credit**. I have done as an adviser commercial banks for 35 40 years but I'm not a commercial banker. I'm an **investment banker**.

</details>

**主持人**: 几乎所有，如果不是全部，那些改变**UniCredit**的好主意都来自于倾听分行和一线员工的意见。所以我想，如果你想实现卓越，并且你谦逊地倾听人们的意见……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Most if not all of the good ideas that transform **uni credit** come from listening to people in the branches and in the and in in the trenches in general. So I think if you want to achieve excellence and you have a humility to listen to people

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 然后随着时间的推移，你可以将这些整合起来，这意味着，这行得通，那行不通，我们需要将其整合起来，这就是我们要做的战略。你会发现，过程很艰难，但结果更容易。另一件非常重要的事情是，因为你经历了那个过程，而且这些想法大体上来自于那些觉得“这是我的想法，我正在看到它付诸实践”的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and then over time you can bring that together into so means this work with doesn't work we need to pull it together this is the strategy we're going to do you will find that it's a lot the process is hard but the outcome is easier and the other thing that is very important is that because you went through that process and because the ideas are by and large coming from people who feel that is my idea and I'm seeing it in action.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们150%地接受它，并希望将其推向另一边。所以我确实认为这些是你拥有的普遍事物。其余的则是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They're embracing it 150% and want to take it on the other side. So I do think that these are generic things that you have. The rest is

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我可能有点强迫症。我一直在思考银行。我妻子会说，我们第一次旅行去**墨西哥**时，在我们去看**奇琴伊察**之前，我带她去参观了一家分行，因为它们当时是最现代的，我想看看它们如何运作，如何发挥作用，因为我喜欢它从客户到后台的工业构成。所以，有很多事情，但最终你需要热爱你所做的事情。你需要有那种抱负才能完成它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I tend to maybe be a little bit obsessive. I think about banks all the time. My wife would say that in the first trip we took, we went to **Mexico** and before we even went to see **Chicha**, I went I took her to see a branch because they were the most modern at the time to see how they act, how they function because I like the industrial makeup of how it goes from the client all the way back. So, it's a number of things, but ultimately you need to love what you do. You need to have that aspiration in order to get it done.

</details>

### 决策、资本配置与企业文化

**主持人**: 是的。当你做决定时，有多少是直觉或模式识别，有多少是分析？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. when you make decisions, how much is instinct or uh pattern recognition and how much is analysis?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以我认为两者兼而有之。我想说以下几点。第一点是，这可能有所帮助。嗯，我一生中大部分时间都见证了交易。嗯，我们过去常说，杰出的交易员在55%的时间里是正确的。不是100%，不是90%，也不是80%，而是55%。但他们非常擅长在45%的情况下止损，理解哪里出了问题。他们有纪律地止损。他们重新开始。嗯，所以这始终定义了我的观点，即速度很重要。所以是的，你需要尽可能多地获取要素，但有一个点你需要做出决定，你永远不会拥有100%的所有事实。是否存在直觉的成分？是的，从定义上讲，当你快速地根据充分但不完整的信息做出决定时，就存在直觉的成分。存在一种，我会说，我不知道你是否想称之为纪律、谦逊，即说我知道这可能行不通，所以让我观察它，然后让我准备好承认如果我犯了错误，我就会止损，重新开始。你止损，而不是因为老板做出的决定就不能错，因为那样你就会陷入一个不好的境地。我认为如果你一次又一次地这样做，通过迭代，你就能以正确的速度获得正确的参数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So I think it's both. I would say the following things. The first thing is maybe that helps. Uh having witnessed trading for a large period of my life. Uh we used to say that the outstanding traders are right 55% of their time. Not 100 and not 90 and not 80, 55. But they're very good at cutting their losses on that 45% understanding what was wrong. They cut their losses with discipline. They start again. Um so that has always defined my view that speed is important. So yes, you need to get as many element as possible but there is a point where you need to take the decision and you will never have 100% all the facts. Is there there uh an element of gut feeling? Yes, by definition there is when you are taking decision on thorough but incomplete information at speed by definition there is an element of gut there is an element of I would say I don't know if you want to call it discipline of humility of saying I know this may not work so let me observe it and then let me be ready to acknowledge if I made a mistake I cut it off I start again you cut your losses not it's a decision that the boss was made. So it cannot be wrong because then you dive into a situation that is not good. And I think if you do that again and again and again by iteration you get in the right parameter at the right speed.

</details>

**主持人**: 当你比较你现在和三五年前的日常工作方式时，有什么变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When you compare how you spend your day now compared to let's say three and five years ago how how has it changed?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我很想告诉你它改变了。我认为改变的因素是，我更了解与我共事的人了。可以说，当我刚来的时候，我天生比较冷淡，因为我没有情感投入。我来是为了完成一份工作。今天，我有了情感投入，我认为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I would love to tell you that it has changed. I think the element that has changed is that I know the people I work with a lot better and let's say when I arrived by definition I was relatively cold because I was not emotionally invested I arrived to do a job today I am emotionally invested I think

</details>

**主持人**: 这有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: what what are the implications what

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 这既有积极影响也有消极影响。有些决定我需要强迫自己去做，因为我知道后果，我知道它们对那些我认识的人会产生什么影响。我认识他们的面孔。我知道他们做什么，我知道他们会如何反应。以前更容易。嗯，同时，它也提供了能量，因为它给你，至少对我来说，我不能让他们失望。我们需要完成它。我们能完成它。需要什么才能完成它？所以它给了你一种否则你不会拥有的能量和决心。你以比其他CEO花更多时间在**资本配置**上而闻名。告诉我你是如何思考**资本配置**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: the implication of that is positive and negative there are certain decision that I need to force myself to take because I know the consequences and I know the consequencees is they have on people that I I know the face off. I know what they do and I know how they're going to react. Before it was easier. Uh at the same time it feeds energy because it it feeds in you and into at least for me I can't let them down. We need to get that done. We can get that done. What does it take to get that done? So it gives you an energy and a determination that otherwise you don't have. You are known for spending more time on **capital allocation** than other CEOs. What tell me about how you think about **capital allocation**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我会说我以很多事情而闻名。其中大多数都不是真的。我会说，嗯，如果你问我的团队，我大部分时间都花在业务的“工业”方面。流程如何运作？技术如何运作？工作方式如何运作？我们能否改变组织使其变得更好？嗯，为什么是那个产品而不是那个解决方案等等。所以我深入细节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I would say that I'm known for a lot of things. Most of them are not true. I would say that uh if you asked my team, I spend most of my time let's call it on the industrial side of the business. How do the process work? How do the technology work? How do the way of working work? Can we change the organization to make it better? Uh why that product rather than that solution etc etc. So I go a lot in the details.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以，一件事是询问那些比你懂得多的人，比如分行风险或其他方面的经典主题专家。另一件事是漠不关心，把所有事情都委托出去，因为一切都很好。所以我试图理解发生的一切。然而，确实有一个因素是银行，这来自于我的咨询生涯，一直低估了，直到最近才重视起来，那就是我们有运营成本，我们也有股权成本，这也是一种成本。所以不考虑我的资本成本是9%、10%、11%或12%，或者当我开始时是17%是错误的。因此，在我们做出的决定中，我们优先将资本——这是一种稀缺的商品，它不属于我们，我们受股东委托——部署到我们可以获得最佳回报的地方。它始于此，然后它变成了我如何让回报较低的地方表现更好，这样我也可以在那里部署资本，因此**资本配置**成为推动业务的口号，既能盈利增长，因为每个人都和你谈论增长或回报。如果你看我们现在的计划，那不是新闻。我们说的是，我们希望处于增长和分配的最佳交汇点。要做到这一点，你需要最大化盈利能力。因此，你需要寻求我们称之为“质量”的增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So one thing is to ask people who know more than you the classic subject matter expert on the branch risk or whatever. Another thing is to be oblivious and delegate everything because everything is okay. So I try to understand everything that occurs. It is true however that one element that banks and this comes from my advisory career have had always underestimated until recently is that we have cost operational and we have cost of equity with a cost as well. So not factoring in that my cost of capital is 9 10 11 or 12% or when I started 17 is wrong and therefore in the decision that we made we prioritize the deployment of capital which is a scarce community commodity it doesn't belong to us we're entrusted by shareholders on that into the places where we could extract the best return. It started with that then it's then it became how can I make the places where the returns are lower better performing so I can deploy the capital there as well and therefore **capital allocation** between became a mantra for driving a business that both grows profitably because everybody talks to you about growth or return. If you look at the plan we have now that is no news. What we're saying is we want to be at the optimal intersection of growth and distribution. To do that, you need to have maximization of profitability. And therefore, you need to seek a growth that we call it quality.

</details>

**主持人**: 一种旨在捍卫利润的增长，去那些你的竞争对手因任何原因不去的地方。太复杂了。他们没有基础设施。他们没有知识。创造价值太痛苦了，找到这些，显然当我们从财务角度来看时，就是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A growth that seeks to defend margin to go in the places where your comparisons don't go for any reason. Too complicated. They don't have the infrastructure. They don't have the knowledge. It's too painful to create value and find that and obviously when we look at it from a financial standpoint is

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 在那个领域我的成本收入比是多少。所以我有多高效，其次我使用了多少资本，以及这些资本是否得到了高于其成本的回报。我们审视这一点，然后对业务进行排名。但随后我们回到这些业务，我们说我们如何运营它们？我们能改变吗？这就像造一辆车。一个流程，一步一步，一切都是一个步骤。我们能改变并自动化它吗？人们倾向于自动化。首先你需要重新设计流程。然后你需要自动化并使用**AI**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: what is my cost income ratio in that area. So how efficient I am and secondly how much capital am I using and is that capital being rewarded above what it cost me or not. We look at that and we rank the businesses. But then we go back on those businesses and we say how do we run them? Can we change? It's like building a car. A process step, step everything is a step. Can we change that and automate it? People tend to automate. First you need to redesign the process. Then you need to automate and use **AI**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你是如何重新设计企业文化的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How have you redesigned the corporate culture?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以这是一个好问题，因为，嗯，我相信文化是所有一切的基石。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So this is a good question because uh I believe that culture is the lynch of everything. everything. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 你拥有正确的文化，最终你会赢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You have the right culture, eventually you're going to win.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我，我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Uh I I

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以当你第一天来的时候，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So when you came when you came in the first day Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 你坐下来和人们交谈，你认为企业文化的哪一部分，哇，我认为我们需要改变这个？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and you sat down and talked to people, what what part of the corporate culture do you think, wow, I think we need to to change this?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 所以我会说，首先，彻底改变企业文化非常困难，需要极长的时间。最终……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: So I would say this first of all, changing completely a corporate culture is very difficult and takes an extremely long period of time. Eventually,

</details>

**主持人**: 需要多长时间？大幅改变它需要十年以上，因为不可避免地……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: how long time does it take? changing it dramatically more than a decade because inevitably

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 要改变它，你需要清除那些不属于这种文化的人，如果你手下有8万人，其中大多数人都不属于这种文化，那将花费你很长很长很长的时间。所以我认为你不能强加你的文化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: to change it you need to purge the people who are not in that culture and if you have 80,000 people below you and most of them are not in that culture it's going to take you a long long long time so I don't think you can impose your culture

</details>

**主持人**: 我看待它的方式是，你最好去一个你的原则、价值观、文化与你匹配的地方，也许不是100%，但至少在很大程度上匹配，否则你将面临非常困难的时期。嗯，我在**UniCredit**有什么？我想我以前就了解**UniCredit**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: in the way I look at it is you better go in a place where your way of principal value culture matches maybe not 100% but to a large extent otherwise you're going to have a very difficult time uh what did I have in **uni credit** I think I knew **uni credit** from before

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，我认为他们总是给我留下深刻印象，他们为**UniCredit**而生，为**UniCredit**而呼吸，他们热爱**UniCredit**。嗯，我们用意大利语说，他们工作时和不工作时都穿着**UniCredit**的T恤。对他们来说，这是一种骄傲。他们是那个团队的一部分，很多机构都不是这样，来自投资银行的很多机构都不是这样。我有一些在那里工作了20年、25年、30年的人，他们喜欢在那里工作了那么长时间。第二件事是，他们在2000年代初期曾是需要击败的团队，他们习惯于成为需要击败的团队，他们快速、创新、积极。他们可能没有，以事后诸葛亮的眼光来看，总是很容易。他们没有被束缚在一个盒子里，这阻止了他们将那种积极性和速度等带到后来转化为问题的事情上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: uh I think they always stroke me as living and breathing **uni credit** they adore **uni credit** uh we say in Italian they wear the **UN credit t-shirt** when they work when they're not at work for them it's an element of pride they're part of that team not many institutions are like that coming from **investment banking** not many institution like that I have people who have been there 20 years 25 years 30 years and they love to have been there for all that time second thing they used to be the team to beat in the early 2000s and they were accustomed to be the team to beat they were fast innovative aggressive. They were not maybe with the benefit of hindsight, it's always easy. They were not harnessed in a box that prevented them from bringing that aggression and the speed etc. to things that then converted in problems.

</details>

**主持人**: 但DNA是一种胜利的DNA。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But the DNA was a winning DNA.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我从外面看，觉得在他们不得不承受的收缩之后，以及在某种程度上我会称之为几乎是屈辱的从顶峰跌落谷底之后，他们仍然拥有这种特质，这只是一个让他们重新回到能够实现目标的境地的问题。所以与其改变文化……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And I felt looking at the outside that over the retrenchment that they had to suffer and to a certain extent I would call in almost humiliation to go from the top to the bottom they still had it in them and it was just a question of putting them back in a position to achieve it. So rather than changing the culture

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我来的时候所做的，是我花了九个月时间与一个小团队一起，直接或间接采访了我们8万人中的大约2万到3万人，试图确定是什么原则和价值观让他们充满活力。非常有趣的是，**正直**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: uh what I did when I arrived is I spent nine months contributing with a small team to interviewing directly indirectly about 20,000 people 30,000 people of the 80,000 that we had try to determine what were the principle and values that made them tick very interesting **integrity**

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 很多人，嗯，我会说一个不跟你谈论**正直**的组织……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: very many people well I would say an organization that doesn't talk to you about **integrity** not very likely.

</details>

**主持人**: 不太可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: not very likely.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 第二，已经是**主人翁意识**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Second, already **ownership** for a commercial bank is quite a lot.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 第三，**关怀**。我来自投资银行，没想到会有这个。这是他们最希望拥有的第一条原则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: And thirdly, **care**. Coming from **investment banking**, I didn't expect that to be there. It was the first most voted tenant that they wanted to have

</details>

**主持人**: 因为投资银行不关心。你的意思是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because **investment banks** don't care. You mean

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，因为可能关心你的同事，关心你的客户，关心很多与组织有关的事情。我认为投资银行更**个人主义**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: well because probably care about your colleagues, care about your clients, care about a lot of things that have to do with the organization. And I think **investment banks** are more individualistic

</details>

**主持人**: 比他们，比像这样的商业银行。而且，嗯，我认为在这些支柱上，我们开始说，好吧，那么现在我们是否都同意那个愿景？我们是否都同意那个战略？我们是否都同意那个计划？是的。你是否对此充满热情？是的。然后我们重新赋权给他们。我们曾经有一个非常自上而下的指挥和控制结构。现在我们可能是最赋权的自下而上的组织之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: than they than a commercial bank like this was. And uh I think on those pillars we started saying okay so now we are going to have do we all agree with that vision? Do we all agree with that strategy? We do we all agree with that plan? Yes. Do you feel passionately about it? Yes. Then we empowered them back. We had a very top-down command and control structure. Now we are probably one of the most empowered bottomup organization.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 但为了做到这一点，他们需要相信愿景、战略和计划。他们需要围绕他们相信并能理解的**KPI**（关键绩效指标）和一种文化进行约束或组织。所以从根本上说，我谈了很多关于分行、风险等领域的主题专家，他们在做自己的工作方面比我强得多。然而，我需要理解，当他们做出决定时，他们是否会像我一样，在做出决定时考虑到相同的关注点、原则和价值观？因为他们可能非常优秀，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: But in order to do that they need to believe in the vision, the strategy and the plan. They need to be harnessed or or or or structured around **KPIs** that they believe in and they can understand and one culture. So fundamentally I talked a lot about the subject matter expert in the branch in risk etc. they are much better than I am to doing their jobs. However, I need to understand that when they make the decision, will they have in mind the same concern, principle, and value that I have in making them? Because they may be very good,

**主持人**: 但如果他们走错了方向，你如何控制这一切？所以，文化是让你自信95%到98%的时间你会得到正确结果的原因。银行界之外有人启发过你吗？其他任何学科？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but if they go in the wrong direction, what how do you control all of that? And so, culture is what makes you confident that 95 98% of the time you're going to have the right outcome. Is there anybody from outside the world of banking which have inspired you? Any other discipline?

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 银行界之外？嗯，我追溯到很久以前，因为我小时候是**西庇阿**的粉丝。也许那塑造了我。嗯，一位罗马将军，名叫**西庇阿**，他做到了不可能的事情。26岁时，他率领**罗马军团**在**西班牙**对抗**汉尼拔**。然后他去了，夺回了，我不知道英语怎么说，我想是**迦太基**。他用他的大象击败了**汉尼拔**。这完全是关于战略、赋权、发挥个人最佳优势和做不可能的事情。最近，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Outside the world of banking. Well, I go back a long way because I am a fan of when I was a child. Maybe that shaped me. Uh a Roman general that was called **Cipio** who did the impossible. At 26 he was leading the **Roman legions** against **Hannibals** in **Spain**. And then he went and took back I don't know how you call it in English, **Cartago** I think. and beat **Hannibal** with his elephants. It was all about strategy, empowerment, taking the best of individual pred and doing the impossible. More recently,

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是你如何击败那些大象的。嗯，你知道，非常……所以，这么说吧。你是一个带着漂亮小盾牌的**罗马步兵**，你站在那里，他们用大象向你冲锋，你被告知有可能抵挡住攻击。这会被归类为不可能，但他找到了绕过它的方法。所以，对我来说，那就是那种创造力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: that's how you beat the auto elephants out there. Well, you know, very So, put it this way. You're uh a **Roman infantry** with a nice little shield and you're there and they charge on you with an elephant and you're told it is possible to withstand the attack. It would be classified as impossible, but he found a way to do around it. So, for me, it was that creativity. I

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我的意思是，这很合适，因为你实际上出生在**罗马**，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: mean, it's suitable because you were actually born in **Rome**, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 我出生在**罗马**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I was born in **Rome**.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 好的。所以一切都回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Okay. And it's so it's all coming back.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以一切都回到了那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So it's all coming back to that.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 也许，也许，但在更现代的世界里，嗯，我曾有幸成为一名顾问，他教会了我很多。嗯，没有人是完美的。我不是，他们也不是。但**Emilio Botín**（**桑坦德银行**）教会了我很多关于谦逊、不断追求进步的道理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: It might it might but in the more let's say in the more modern world uh I had uh let's say co as I was blessed to be an adviser that taught me a lot. Uh nobody's perfect. I'm not they were not. But **Emilio Bautina Santandere** taught me a lot on uh humility striving for improvement all the time.

</details>

**主持人**: 如何激励员工，嗯，**Stan O'Neal**（**美林**），嗯，精英主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: how to galvanize people uh **Stan** and **Mary Lynch** uh meritocracy

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，赋权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: uh empowerment

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，如何让人们对事情承担责任，然后他们所有人，包括我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: uh how to make people take ownership of things then all of them including me

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 你曾与他们共事，你是一名顾问，对吧？所以你对这些人有独特的见解。嗯，现在，如果你只谈你的领导原则，只谈你最坚持的那些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: you worked with you were an adviser right so you had uh **Stan Neil** I was working for him as I was working at **Maril Lynch** **Emilio** I was an adviser yes yeah so you had a unique insight into into these people um now if you were just your leadership principles just uh the most important ones that you adhere to.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以领导原则，我认为有一句我非常喜欢的引言来自**麦克雷文上将**，他说如果你想征服世界或改变世界，先从整理自己的床铺开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So leadership principle I think there is a quote I like a lot from **Admiral McRaven** who said if you want to conquer the world or change the world start by making your own bed.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 他说，如果这意味着我需要整理好自己的床铺，我不介意重要会议迟到。他这话是什么意思？他说第一点，在你雄心勃勃地想把大事做好之前，先从小事做起。小决定，大决定。他说第二点是，嗯，这让你回到我一开始说的，脚踏实地，谦逊等等。

<details>
<summary>主持人**: And he was saying I don't mind being late for an important meeting if it means I need to finish my own bed. What is he saying in that? He's saying number one do small things well before you have an ambition to do big things well. Small decision big decision. Second thing that he's saying is uh this brings you back to as I said at the beginning both feet on the ground humility etc.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，这导致了你周围的任何组织，特别是大型组织。嗯，你需要倾听。你需要成为他们的一部分。嗯，你需要花大量时间与你领导的人在一起。了解他们。表明你不是来自外太空的火星人，而是他们中的一员。你重视他们。解释。倾听他们的问题是什么。让他们在某些你可能有的问题上引导你，并且足够谦逊地接受挑战，不要将其视为对你的攻击，而是视为会让你变得更强大的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Um the this leads into whatever organization especially of large people that you have around you. Uh you need to listen. You need to be part of them. Um you need to spend a lot of time with the people you lead. Understand them. Show that you're not a Martian from out there but you're one of them. That you value them. Explain. Listen to what their questions are. Get them to guide you on some question that you may have and be humble enough to accept the challenge not as an attack on you but as something that will make you stronger.

</details>

**主持人**: 然后是，嗯，所以这些事情我认为，然后意识到我们之前说的，你的工作只是将所有这些整合在一起的拼图的一部分，成为他们分享的，他们可以认同的，他们充满热情的东西，然后推动他们走向卓越，因为一开始，不可能的是这个人对我要求太多了，但后来它变成了，哇，你知道，首先，很多时候我以为不可能的事情，我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Then there is uh and so these things I think and then realize what we said before that your job is just one part of the puzzle of bringing it all together into something that they share that they can identify that they feel passionate about and then drive them towards excellence because at the beginning the impossibility is this guy is asking too much of me but then it becomes wow you know first of all many times what I thought was impossible I

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 这让你以一种让你几乎飘飘然的方式重新评估自己，即使你失败了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: that gets you to rerate yourself in a way that make you almost walk on air and even if you fail

</details>

**主持人**: 通常你都领先于那些只求达到中等水平而不是可能水平的人。你的动力来自哪里？你想向谁展示？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: usually you're ahead of the people who just aim to be to arrive to the media not to the possible where does your drive come from who do you want to show

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我认为在很大程度上是向我自己展示。我不喜欢，与人们相信的相反，嗯，公开认可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: I think to a large extent myself I don't like contrary to what people believe uh public recognition

</details>

**主持人**: 我喜欢这样想，我设定了一个目标，它非常困难，你知道吗，我做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I like to think of myself I set an objective it was very hard and you know what I got there

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 我做到了，现在我将设定另一个目标，我也会做到。对我来说，嗯，在很大程度上是自我满足。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: and I got there and now I'm going to set another one and I will get there for me it's uh it's self-satisfaction to a very large extent

</details>

**主持人**: 你母亲曾在**联合国**工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: your mother worked for the **UN**

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 你说得对，你做了你的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: you're right you did your work

</details>

**主持人**: 在**罗马**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: was in **Rome**

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 对你来说，让她或你父亲感到骄傲重要吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: has it been important for you to make her proud or or your father

</details>

**主持人**: 非常非常重要，因为，嗯，从小我就接触到**多样性**，在**罗马**，既因为学校，也因为**罗马**是世界上唯一一个同时拥有**意大利**国家、**联合国**和**梵蒂冈**大使馆和领事馆的城市。所以那里充满了来自世界各地的公务员，他们很大程度上倾向于国际学校，但**法国高中**就是其中之一。所以，观点的**多样性**、宗教的**多样性**、信仰的**多样性**，但我们仍然是好朋友。这确实塑造了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: very very important because uh from a young age u **diversity** uh I was exposed in **Rome** both because of school because **Rome** is the only city in the world where you have embassy and consulate to the **Italian state**, the **UN** and the **Vatican**. So it's full of public servants from every part of the world and they tend to gravitate to a large extent on international schools but **Frenchly** say was one of them. So, **diversity** of views, **diversity** of religion, **diversity** of belief, but we're still good friends. That did shape

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，我成长在一个思考**开放性**的时代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: uh and I was um I grew up in a generation that thought about **openness**

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，通过展示我们可以一起做更多事情等方式吸引不同的人。所以我不太喜欢我们今天所处的这种分裂、分离、疏远的**世界**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: u attracting people who were different through demonstrating that there was more we could do together, etc. So I'm not leaving very well the world of fracture separation distances that we have today.

</details>

### 放松与给年轻人的建议

**Andrea Orcel**: 你如何放松？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: How do you relax?

</details>

**主持人**: 我如何放松？嗯，今天我花时间与我的妻子和女儿在一起，或者与我的狗在一起，或者我做运动，因为它能让我放松。所以我们之前谈到过**拳击**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do I relax? Um today I spend time in order with my uh wife and daughter or with my dog or I do sports because it takes my mind. So, we talked before about **boxing**

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 因为当你这样做的时候，你的大脑需要专注于你的对手，否则你很快就会被击中，但你需要专注于你正在做的事情。但这迫使我完全放下我周围的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: because while you're doing it, your mind needs to focus on your adversary or you're going to get punched every bite that very quickly, but you need to focus on what you're doing. But that forces me to completely let go

</details>

**主持人**: 抛开我周围的一切。对我来说，这是一种奢侈。我很少有机会这样做。所以，体育锻炼或需要我专注的活动。我喜欢和家人一起在水上或雪上滑雪。嗯，是的，这就是我做的。我没有做更多。我没有……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: of everything else around me. And that for me is a is luxury. I I don't get to do that very often. And uh so physical exercise or endeavors where I need to focus. I love skiing open air with my family both on water or on uh snow. Uh yeah, this is what I do. I don't do much more. I don't

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 你读什么？你读什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: What you read? What do you read?

</details>

**主持人**: 我时不时地读书。我最近重读的最后一本书，因为我很久以前读过它。有一本**西班牙**作家**Poster Gillio**写的书，他写了这本关于**被诅咒的军团**的书，那是**西庇阿**入侵**非洲**的故事，嗯，显然它既是故事，也是历史事实。从历史角度来看非常好，但它是一个故事，它能让我把思想从其他一切中抽离出来，完全沉浸在一些完全不同的东西中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I read from time to time. The last book I I I I recently reread because I read it a long time ago. There is a book by a **Spanish** author actually called **Poster Gillio** who uh wrote this book about the **cursed relegence** which is **CP invasion of Africa** and uh obviously it's it's a story as well as historical facts. is very uh good from an historical standpoint, but it's a story and it's a good to get my mind away from everything else and get absorbed in something completely different.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯。你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Mhm. What is your advice to young people?

</details>

**主持人**: 这总是非常困难。给年轻人的建议。嗯，我会说一些普遍性的东西。我会说第一点，花时间选择你热爱、激励你、让你达到目标的旅程、工作、轨迹。我记得在投资银行工作时，那是我选择的，因为我热爱它。人们问我的第一个问题是，我什么时候能赚到第一个一百万美元？我的第一个回答是，如果这就是你选择它的原因，那么很难达到那个目标，因为你需要经历魔鬼训练营。如果你不喜欢它，没有任何金钱可以弥补。所以第一点，确保这不是你的朋友喜欢的，也不是你的父母喜欢的。确保这是你自己的选择，你真的喜欢你所做的事情。第二点是，选择在你能认同的组织和与你能认同的人一起做这件事。当我们年轻时，我们都认为银行就是银行，公司就是公司。银行和公司非常非常不同。我曾在**高盛**工作。我曾在**美林**工作。可以说，很多人会告诉你，**高盛**在实质上比**美林**更好。一家几乎破产了，另一家没有。但就我的性格而言，**美林**更好，因为我在那个环境中茁壮成长，而在**高盛**则不然。这并不意味着**高盛**不是一家杰出的公司，我最好的朋友仍然在那里。太棒了。但你在哪里做这件事非常重要，因为那种公司会吸引与你有一些共同点的人，或者没有。如果你有这两件事，那么其余的就会水到渠成。另一件事是，对你想要去的方向有一个想法，但不要认为它会按照你想象的方式发生，因为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's always very difficult. Advice to young people. Um I would be generic. I would say number one, take the time to choose the journey, the job, the trajectory that you love, that motivates you, that gets you there. I remember that being in **investment banking**, which was a choice as you remember that I did because I loved it. People were asking me first question, when will I make my first million dollar? And my first answer was if that is why you chose it very very hard to get to that point because you need to go through boot camp. There is no money that is going to compensate for that if you don't like it. So number one make sure there is not what your friends like what your parents like. Make sure the choice is your choice and you really like what you do. The second thing is choose to do it in organization and with people where you identify. When we're all young, we think that a bank is a bank, a company is a company. Banks and companies are very, very different. I worked at **Goldman Sachs**. I worked at **Maril Lynch**. Arguably, many many people would tell you **Goldman Sachs** is a materially better company than **Maril Lynch** was. One went almost bankrupt, the other one didn't. But for my character, **Marilynch** was better because I I thrived in that environment and at **Goldman** I didn't. That does not mean **Goldman** is not an exceptional firm and my best friends are still there. Fantastic. But where you do it is very important because that kind of company will will attract people that are with whom you have something in common or not. And if you have those two things then the rest is going to take care of themselves. The other thing is do have an idea of the direction where you want to go but don't think it's going to happen the way you think it's going to happen because

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 职业生涯不是直线，它们是拼图，实际上，失败可能与胜利一样重要，甚至更重要，因为我们谈论的是**韧性**。你不会对胜利感到满意，你从胜利中什么也学不到，从失败中你学到很多关于你自己以及如何做得更好的东西。所以如果你有这些东西，那么我想说更多的建议是，我希望今天进入职场的这一代人不要轻易放弃，去做今天看起来不可能的事情，那就是让世界回到一个中心，我们正在远离这个中心，嗯，我认为作为一个世代，如果我们不采取行动，我们正在把我们的孩子置于一个不如我们年轻时所处的境地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: careers are not straight line the jigsaws and actually the failures are probably as important if not much more important because of what we were saying about **grit** than the wins. you don't you're satisfied with win you don't learn anything from wins failures you learn a lot about yourself and about what to do better so if you have those things and then I would say more recommendation I hope that the generation that is coming into the ranks today doesn't take no for an answer does what today seems impossible which is getting the world to go back to a center that is from which we are going way that uh I think as a generation if we don't do something we have we're leaving our children in a situation that is not as good as the one we found

</details>

**主持人**: 当我们非常年轻的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: when we were very age.

</details>

**Andrea Orcel**: 嗯，**Andrea**，很明显你清楚自己的方向，你不接受拒绝，你热爱你所做的事情，并且你与人一起做。这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrea Orcel**: Well **Andrea** it's um very clear that you know where you're going that you don't take no for an answer that you love what you do and you do it with people. It's been great.

</details>

**主持人**: 非常感谢。
