### 沉迷于欣赏：一次重塑大脑的TED演讲

大家好，我叫蒂姆。我沉迷于欣赏。我知道这听起来很奇怪。但如果我在接下来的八分钟左右做好我的工作，你们将再也不会以同样的方式看待任何事物。这都要归功于我在2018年一个糟糕的日子里看到的一个井盖。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hi, my name is Tim.
I'm addicted to appreciation.
I know that sounds really strange.
But if I do my job
over the next eight minutes or so,
you're not going to look at anything
the same way ever again.
And because of a manhole cover
that I saw back on a terrible day in 2018.</p>

### 职业生涯中最糟糕的一天

那是我职业生涯中最糟糕的三天之一，名副其实。那是美国企业界里那种滑稽又痛苦的日子之一。我当时管理着一个270人的团队。每个人似乎都在同一天、同一时间崩溃了。八小时不必要的、充满争议的会议，我相信你们知道我在说什么，而且那个春天还有裁员即将到来。我是公司里少数几个知道裁员即将到来的人之一。所以那种恐惧和不知所措的情绪一直笼罩着我。我下地铁，又迟到了，赶着去吃晚饭，当然，我立刻查看手机，我收到了老板的邮件，上面写着：“明天早上9点到办公室，准备好迎接一场糟糕的会议。”就像，太棒了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It was quite literally one
of the top three
worst days of my entire career.
One of those comically miserable days
in corporate America.
I was managing a team of 270 people.
Everybody seemed to have a meltdown
on the same exact day,
at the same exact time.
Eight hours of unnecessarily
contentious meetings,
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about,
and there were pending layoffs
coming that spring.
I was one of the few people in the company
that knew that they were coming, too.
So the dread in the overwhelm
was just hanging over me.
I get off the subway,
late again for dinner,
and of course, I check
my phone immediately,
and there's an email
from my boss that says,
“Be in the office at 9am tomorrow morning,
and be prepared for that meeting to suck."
Like, great.
(Laughter)</p>

### 从井盖引发的思考

在我回家的路上，我心想：“哦，一个井盖。”你知道，有人想出把它们做成圆形而不是方形会更安全，这很酷。而且我敢肯定它们也是在印度制造的，考虑到我们在纽约市，这很有趣。我应该晚点查查这个。”我对自己说：“蒂姆，搞什么鬼？你怎么会在如此糟糕的一天，从所有这些压倒性的思绪跳跃到一个井盖上？”这在当时是一个真诚的问题。我是个白痴吗？我的大脑是怎么从一个地方跳到另一个地方的？这是我大脑中阻碍我的部分吗？一份非常严肃的企业工作。这是我大脑中分散我注意力、不让我超越现状的部分吗？不。

<details>

<p class="english-text">As I'm walking home,
I go, "Ooh, a manhole cover.
You know, it's pretty cool that somebody
figured out that they would be safer
if they were circles instead of squares.
And I'm pretty sure
that they're made in India, too,
which is interesting,
considering we're in New York City.
I should look that up later."
I’m like, “Tim, what the F?
How in the world did you go
from all these overwhelming thoughts
on such a terrible day
to a manhole cover?"
Like this is a sincere
question in the moment.
Am I an idiot?
Like how is my brain going
from one place to another?
Is this the part of my brain
that was holding me back?
Very serious corporate job.
Is this the part of my brain
that is distracting me,
that is not allowing me
to grow further than where I was?</p>
</details>

### 欣赏的定义与力量

这是我意识到我沉迷于欣赏的时刻。没有它，生活就变得格外乏味，因为我以这种方式看待平凡的事物。欣赏是注意到并珍视我们世界中美好事物的行为。所以根据定义，请看屏幕，如果你要逐字阅读幻灯片，我希望你思考一下，如果你能长期坚持以这种方式思考，那会意味着什么。沉迷于欣赏意味着沉迷于识别和享受某人或某事的美好品质，或者仅仅是渴望更好地理解我们周围的世界。想想这对你的日常生活意味着什么。是的，这是活在当下，这是享受某种活动和你身边的人。但它也包括那些小事，比如纽约市的圆形井盖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No.
This was the realization
that I was addicted to appreciation.
And that without it,
life was remarkably less enjoyable
because I was seeing
the mundane things in this way.
Appreciation is the act of noticing
and valuing the good in our worlds.
So by definition, and please
read this screen,
if there's one of the slides
you actually read word for word,
I want you to think
of what this would mean
if you thought this way
on a consistent basis too.
Being addicted to appreciation
means being addicted to the recognition
and enjoyment of the good qualities
of someone or something,
or simply wanting to have a better
understanding of the world around us.
Think about what that would mean
for your day-to-day.
And yes, this is being present,
this is the enjoyment
of some sort of activity
and the people around you.
But it's also the small things,
like a round manhole cover
in New York City.</p>

### 欣赏如何解锁新的人生层面

当我开始消化这一点并思考，这到底意味着什么，我该如何利用它，我意识到，在任何认知偏见（cognitive biases: 指人们在判断时出现的系统性偏差）出现之前，我就已经沉迷于看到美好并给予他人信任，这为我解锁了完全不同的人生和享受的层面。我越是投入其中，它就给我带来能量，给我带来对生活的热情，以及日复一日的快乐，这是我从未想象过的，也引领我走到了今天。即使是在2018年那个阴沉的日子里。顺便说一句，我穿着同一套西装，这是最疯狂的事情。所以那天晚上我当然把它发到了社交媒体上。发布了一个仅限 Instagram 的快拍，写着“沉迷于欣赏”，当时我的关注者只有朋友和家人。但实际上，我是说给自己听的。这样看待生活是可以的。这几乎是一种解脱的时刻，我想：“我要更深入地拥抱它，它会带来什么呢？”这不仅能解锁你看待事物的方式，更是一种你可以练习的行为，它会以你无法想象的方式给你带来快乐，直到你真正开始去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As I started to digest this and think,
what does this actually
mean and how do I harness it,
I realized that before any cognitive
biases could pop into my head,
I was addicted to seeing the good
and giving benefit of the doubt
in a way that just unlocked
an entirely different level of life
for me, and enjoyment.
And the more that I leaned into this,
it gave me energy,
it gave me lust for life,
and it gave me just joy
on a day-to-day basis
in ways that I could never imagine
that have led me here today.
Even on a day as gloomy
as that day back in 2018.
By the way, I'm wearing
the same exact suit,
which is the craziest thing.
So of course I put it
on social media that night.
Forward Instagram-only story,
be addicted to appreciation,
really for friends and family
as my only followers back then.
But really, I was saying it for me.
That it's OK to see life this way.
It was almost this like freeing moment
of, I'm going to lean into this harder
and what is it going to do?
This is something that will not
only unlock how you see things,
but this is an act that you can practice
and will bring you joy in ways
that you will not be able to imagine
until you actually start to do it.</p>

### 欣赏与感恩的区别

我知道你们也在想什么。欣赏和感恩，我们说的是同一件事吗？不，这是两件截然不同的事情。欣赏是基础性的。感恩是交易性的。要表达感恩，你实际上是收到了某样东西。欣赏则可以融入你所做的一切，融入你日复一日的存在之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know what you're thinking, too.
Appreciation and gratitude,
like aren’t we talking
about the same thing here?
No, these are two very different things.
Appreciation is foundational.
Gratitude is transactional.
To show gratitude, you are actually
receiving something.
Appreciation is something
that can just layer into everything
that you are doing
and just your existence
on a day-to-day basis.</p>
</details>

### 将欣赏应用于日常生活

以如此一致的方式看待生活可能会让人觉得烦恼，比如连续三天都在下雨？也许这对水库有好处。工作中那个让你胃里发紧的死对头？那是一个需要你更好去理解的人。出现在他们需要被满足的地方，然后你在关系中就占据了上风，仅仅因为你更欣赏他们。请相信我这一点。这一点效果非常好，非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It can be annoying to see life
this way on such a consistent basis,
like raining for the third day in a row?
Maybe that's good for the reservoirs.
That arch nemesis at work
that is kind of like that person
that gives you a pit in your stomach?
That's somebody to understand better.
Show up where they need to be met,
and then you have the upper hand
in the relationship
simply because you appreciated them more.
Please trust me on this one.
This one works super, super well.</p>

### 学术研究的佐证

这不仅仅是我的看法。当它仅仅是我的看法时，感觉很好，但看到它得到证实，更是达到了一个全新的高度。罗格斯大学有一位教授，她将欣赏作为其研究的核心部分。她得出结论，欣赏可以是一种性情。它与感恩不同。事实上，感恩只是构成欣赏的八个组成部分之一。通过通过日复一日地留意事物，你也可以拥有这种欣赏的心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is not just my opinion.
It felt really good
when it was just my opinion,
but to see this corroborated
took it to a whole nother level.
There's a professor from Rutgers
that made appreciation
a core part of her studies.
And she concluded that appreciation
can be a disposition.
That it is not the same as gratitude.
That gratitude is actually just one
of eight components
that makes up what appreciation is.
And simply by noticing things
on a day-to-day basis,
you can have this mindset
of appreciation, too.</p>
</details>

### 社交媒体上的意外成功

这让我拥有了 डेढ़百万的社交媒体观众，对于一个48岁的人来说，说出来很奇怪。我制作了关于我企业生活的日常vlog，内容疯狂，从早上4点到晚上10点，以15分钟的时间块进行安排。人们说：“哇，这很酷，而且看得很舒缓。”“这是你40多岁时一个超棒的星期一”——这个社交媒体的开场白，我做梦也想不到它会真正火起来。它确实火了。我开始看到诸如“你让成长不那么可怕了”之类的评论。以及“即使我们来自完全不同的世界，我也喜欢你看待生活的方式。”我从未想过这条路会把我带到今天，但这就是欣赏为我所做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what led to me having an audience
of a million and a half people
on social media,
which is super weird to say
at 48 years old.
I was making these daily vlogs
of my corporate life
that were like, maniacal 4am to 10pm,
scheduled in 15-minute
time-blocking increments.
And people were like, wow, this is cool
and like super soothing to watch.
"This is a dope-ass Monday in your 40s"
is an opening hook on social media
I never in a million years
thought it would actually take off.
And it did.
And I started to see comments
along the lines of,
"You make growing up less scary."
And "Even though we are
from completely different worlds,
I love the way that you look at life."
I had no intention of having
that path lead me here today,
but that's what appreciation
has done for me.</p>

### 如何开始练习欣赏

所以，让我告诉你如何开始将它融入你的生活。我们先从一个事物开始。为了选择一个我们身边触手可及的东西，我们就选灯泡吧。在当今世界无处不在。我们不会对它表达感恩，对吧？我们不会停下来想：“我非常感谢这个灯泡。”但如果你能想想灯泡随着时间推移所取得的进步，想想它对我们情绪的影响，看看这个舞台。看看灯光能做什么。这是非凡的。即使你只是想，“哇，真棒”，这样的一个闪念也能带来巨大的不同。更不用说它能为你做什么了。它能在你需要的时候照亮房间的事实。所以今晚睡觉前，花一秒钟想想灯泡吧。这会带来不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let me show you how you can start
to incorporate it into your life too.
We’re going to start with a thing.
For the sake of picking something
that is around us right now,
we're going to go with the light bulb.
Omnipresent in today's world.
Something we don't show
gratitude for, right?
Like we don’t stop and go like,
I'm so grateful for this light bulb.
But if you can think about the progress
that light bulbs have made over time,
if you can think about what
it can do for our mood,
look at this stage.
Look at what lighting can do.
It is remarkable.
And even if you just think,
“Wow, that’s dope,”
as a passing thought like that
makes a huge difference.
And not to mention what it can do for you.
The fact that it just lights up
a room when you need it to.
So when you go to bed tonight,
think about the light bulb
just for a second.
It will make a difference.</p>

### 欣赏他人：理解的视角

好了，现在是一个人。也许坐在你旁边的人抢了你以为会坐的位置。也许他们在排队时插队了。如果你需要一个理由去想“我如何能更欣赏那个人”，你能看着某人说：“如果拥有你的处境，你至今为止的整个人生，我做得会更好吗？”不，这是一个不可能回答“是”的问题。这是欣赏他人最简单的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alright, now a person.
Maybe the person sitting
next to you stole the seat
that you thought you were going to sit in.
Maybe they cut you off in line.
If you ever need a reason to think
"How I could appreciate that person more,"
could you ever look at somebody and say,
"I would have done better
with your circumstances,
with the entirety of your life
up to this moment"?
No, it's an impossible
question to say yes to.
That's the easiest way
to appreciate someone else more.</p>
</details>

### 欣赏的最终益处

那么，在结束时，欣赏会为你带来什么？我的妻子非常讨厌蛋黄酱。嗨，亲爱的。我的妻子非常讨厌蛋黄酱，这没关系。这并非绝对。世界上充满了可怕、可怕的事情。欣赏并非绝对。但当面对生活中的可怕事物时，我们越能理解和欣赏正在发生的事情，我们就越能欣赏我们在共同改变时所能发挥的能力。欣赏会让你持续地更快乐。它会带来更多奇迹，你会更活在当下，当你持续地表达欣赏时，你会更少地理所当然地看待事物。它将使你能够鼓励他人，并将我们之间的差异视为彼此信任的理由。这是世界现在需要的吗？对万事万物的“如何”和“为什么”有更好的理解？也许是从不同角度审视事物的理由？[翅膀之夜。你觉得这是个陷阱吗？]我们是否应该日复一日地少一些理所当然？我投赞成票。但话说回来，我坚信当我们全心全意……能够欣赏我们共同存在的这个世界时，我们集体所能达到的成就。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">So what appreciation
will do for you in closing?
My wife despises mayonnaise.
Hi, babe.
My wife despises mayonnaise,
and that is fine.
This is not absolute.
The world is full of horrible,
horrible things.
Appreciation is not absolute.
But when it comes
to the horrible things in life,
the more we can understand
and appreciate what is happening,
the more we can appreciate
what we are capable of
when it comes to change together.
Appreciation will make you happier
on a consistent basis.
It will bring more wonder,
you will be more present,
you will take less for granted
when you show appreciation
on a consistent basis.
It will allow you to encourage others
and see the differences between us
as reasons to believe in each other.
Is this something
that the world needs right now?
A better understanding
for the how and why of everything?
Maybe a reason to look at things
skeptically from a different perspective?
[Wing night.
Do you think it's a trap?]
Might this be better for us
to take a bit less for granted
on a day-to-day basis?
I vote yes.
But then again, I firmly believe
in what we [are] capable of collectively
when we wholeheartedly ...
can appreciate the world
that we exist in together.
Thank you.
(Applause)</p>
