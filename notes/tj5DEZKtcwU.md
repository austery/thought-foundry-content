### NPD叙事：觉醒与无力的悖论

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。今天，我们将继续探讨NPD叙事更深层的含义。这也是我们NPD系列的一部分，是第三集。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm Anthony. Welcome to my channel today. We continue our discussion on the deeper meaning of the NPD narrative. This is also part of our NPD series. This is the third episode.</p>
</details>

在前两期视频中，我们共同认同了**NPD**（Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 自恋型人格障碍）概念的积极意义，它让许多人首次认识到伤害，并获得了自我拯救的语言。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the first two videos, we agreed on the positive significance of the concept of "NPD" as it enabled many people to recognize harm for the first time and provided them with the language of self-rescue.</p>
</details>

但与此同时，我们也讨论了这种对NPD的批判正在走向一个奇怪的方向，它将一个心理学概念妖魔化并夸大成一种包罗万象的纯粹邪恶的隐喻。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at the same time, we also discussed how this critique of NPD is heading in a strange direction, demonizing and exaggerating a psychological concept into an all-encompassing metaphor for pure evil.</p>
</details>

当我们以更广阔的视角审视中国社会中的许多思潮时，我们会发现，许多这些最初旨在激发反抗暴政、追求解放并迈向觉醒的理论，实际上却导致了一种奇怪的局面。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we take a broader perspective and look at many trends of thought in Chinese society, we will find that many of these theories, which initially only served to inspire resistance against tyranny, pursue liberation, and move towards awakening, have, in reality, led to a strange situation.</p>
</details>

也就是说，这些理论在赋予一部分人力量的同时，却可能让另一部分人更加深陷于受害者的身份之中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, while these theories empower some people, they might make another group of people become even more deeply entrenched in the identity of victims.</p>
</details>

当事人在不断指责那种迫害力量的过程中，他们并没有变得更有动力，反而加剧了他们对那种迫害力量的恐惧和无力感。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The parties involved, in the process of continuously accusing that persecutory force, did not become more motivated; on the contrary, it exacerbated their fear and powerlessness against that persecutory force.</p>
</details>

换句话说，许多看似在促进主体意识觉醒的论述，反而变成了一种更为隐蔽的、逃避主体性的症状，因为人类对主体性觉察的逃避拥有巨大的创造力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words, many statements that seem to promote the awakening of subjective consciousness instead became a more covert method, symptoms of escaping subjectivity, as human beings' evasion of awareness of subjectivity possesses tremendous creativity.</p>
</details>

那么，它们之间究竟存在着怎样的根本差异？为什么有些觉醒能赋予我们力量，而有些“觉醒”却让我们感到更加无助呢？今天，我们将深入探讨这个话题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what exactly is the fundamental difference between them? Why do some awakenings empower us, but some "awakenings" make us feel even more helpless? Today, we'll delve into this topic.</p>
</details>

我会将本期视频上传并收录到“心理学与教育”的列表中。如果你有任何想与我讨论的，以及咨询的话题，可以通过邮件联系我预约。

</details>

### NPD控制力的根源与创伤的解放

首先，在之前的视频中，我们得出了一个核心结论：NPD看似强大的控制力，并非源于其自身拥有某种莫名的魔力。其主要来源有两个方面：第一，是由环境、文化和制度赋予它的权力和主导地位；其次，也是更隐蔽的，是我们自身内部早已存在的创伤和匮乏，这需要我们鼓起勇气去面对。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, in the previous video, we drew a core conclusion: NPD's seemingly powerful control does not originate from some inexplicable magic it inherently possesses. Its main sources are two aspects: first, the power and dominant position bestowed upon it by environment, culture, and institutions; secondly, and more discreetly, the wounds and deficiencies that already exist within ourselves, which we need to muster the courage to face.</p>
</details>

在上期视频中，我们主要讨论了各种权力关系。那么，本期视频，我们需要将镜头完全转向我们自身，去探讨那个更困难，但也更具解放意义的话题：我们的创伤是如何成为被对方“控制”的关键？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the last video, we mainly discussed various power relations. So, in this video, we need to turn the camera completely in our own direction to explore that more difficult, but also more liberating topic: how our trauma becomes the key to being "controlled" by the other party.</p>
</details>

当我们这样思考时，你就会意识到，NPD的破坏力可以通过疗愈自身的创伤来认识和改变，而非某种莫名其妙、不可理喻的邪恶。承认这一点，其实并不容易。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we think like this, you will realize that the destructive power of NPD can be seen as stemming from and changing through healing one's own trauma, rather than some inexplicable and incomprehensible evil. It's actually not easy to admit this.</p>
</details>

将邪恶归因于某种莫名其妙的本质，即便它让一个人活在恐惧和痛苦中，感到无力行动，但它也能让一个人觉得，自己无需面对生活的具体问题，也无需解决问题，因为对方太过强大。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Attributing evil to an inexplicable nature, even though it makes a person live in fear and pain, feeling unable to act, can also make a person feel that they don't need to face the specifics of life or solve the problem, because the other party is too powerful.</p>
</details>

### 财富幻象与内在匮乏

为什么我这么说呢？我们从一个具体的例子开始。在第一期视频中，我们提到了那个假扮富豪的男性**NPD**。他通过搭讪认识了一位女性，有意无意地透露自己在事业上的成功，微信朋友圈里充满了旅行和奢侈品，并用豪车接送。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do I say that? Let's start with a concrete example. In the first video, we mentioned the male NPD who pretended to be a wealthy man. He met a woman by striking up a conversation with her, intentionally or unintentionally revealing his success in his career, filling his WeChat Moments with travel and luxury goods, and picking her up in luxury cars.</p>
</details>

当这位女性以为自己即将开启一段“甜蜜恋情”时，她才从别人的揭露中发现，所有这些身份都是假的。毫无疑问，这个男人的行为是纯粹的欺诈，是不道德的。但为了我们自身的成长，我们需要提出那个更重要的问题：为什么在当事人的心中，炫耀财富就等同于一段甜蜜的恋情？如果我再次遇到类似的人，这种被欺骗的结局真的无法避免吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When this woman thought she was about to embark on a "sweet romance," she only discovered from someone else's revelation that all of these identities were fake. Undoubtedly, this man's behavior was pure fraud and immoral. But for our own growth, we need to raise that more important question: why, in the hearts of those involved, does flaunting wealth equate to a sweet romance? If I encounter a similar person again, is this outcome of being deceived truly unavoidable?</p>
</details>

当一个人被某种浮华的东西所吸引时，或许他可以轻柔地问自己这个问题：这种吸引力是否源于自身某种深层的匮乏感？如果一个人在成长过程中经历过贫困，或者长期生活在对财务不安全的焦虑中，那么财富对她而言是什么？它不仅仅是具体的金钱数额，更是“安全”、“稳定”和“被保护”的强烈心理象征。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When a person is attracted to something flashy, perhaps they could gently ask themselves this question: is this attraction stemming from some kind of deep-seated sense of lack within oneself? If a person experiences poverty during their growth process or lives in a state of anxiety about financial insecurity for a long time, then what is wealth to her? It's not just about specific amounts of money; it's also about 'safety,' 'stability,' and the strong psychological symbol of 'being protected.'</p>
</details>

一个开着豪车的男人，她可能不会把他看作一个炫耀者，而是一个能将她从生存焦虑中解救出来的英雄。即便她暂时摆脱了贫困，但她的身份依然被困在过去的匮乏中。这种对安全的渴望，会暂时性地让一个人的理性短路，因为理性的分析可能会打破带给她暂时慰藉的幻象。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A man driving a luxury car, she might not see him as a show-off; instead, he was someone who could free her from existential anxiety, a rescued hero. Even though she has temporarily escaped poverty, her identity is still trapped in the scarcity of the past. This yearning for security can temporarily short-circuit a person's rationality, because rational analysis might shatter the illusion that brought her temporary comfort.</p>
</details>

而如果她看清并疗愈了自身在物质问题和原生家庭问题上所经历的创伤，那么当她再次遇到这样的人时，她所看到的是，这个男人所有的话题都围绕着金钱和物质，他对我内在的世界毫无兴趣，也无法进行任何深入的交流。结果就是，当事人只会感到无聊和乏味。至于对方是否真的有钱，也就不再那么重要了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if she had seen and healed herself from her material problems and the trauma experienced from issues with her family of origin, then when she encounters such a person again, what she would see is that all topics about this man revolve around money and material possessions. He has absolutely no interest in her inner world, nor is he able to have any in-depth exchanges. The result would be that the person involved simply felt bored and dull. As for whether the other party is really rich, it's not that important anymore.</p>
</details>

### 权力符号的诱惑与内在的无力感

举例来说，在中国，更常见的是对权力符号的迷恋。一个男人总是在饭局上不经意地提及“我认识某某局长”，“我跟某某领导吃过饭”。对于从小经历过无力感的人，对于感到无力的年轻人来说，他很可能会不假思索地陷入对这些符号的崇拜。这些东西对他而言，拥有某种巫术般的魔力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, in China, more common is a fascination with symbols of power. A man always casually mentions at dinner parties, 'I know Director So-and-so,' or 'I have had dinner with a certain official.' For someone who experienced powerlessness from a young age, or for young people who feel powerless, they probably fall into the worship of these symbols without thinking. These things possess a kind of witchcraft-like magic for them.</p>
</details>

他不会去思考，这种所谓的“熟人关系”究竟是强关系还是弱关系。他也不会去思考，这种权力可能受到上级的影响，或者各种内部的制约。在他的想象中，这个系统本身是铁板一块、无所不能的。当然，被这个人欺骗的人，他们当然值得同情。但这并非一个完全无法避免的结局。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He doesn't think about whether this so-called 'familiar relationship' is a strong or weak one. He wouldn't think either that this power may be subject to influence from superiors or various internal constraints. In his imagination, the system itself is monolithic and omnipotent. Of course, those deceived by this person certainly deserve sympathy, but this is not an entirely unavoidable ending.</p>
</details>

### NPD的理想化与创伤的共鸣

我们再举一个更常见的例子。一个女性成长在一个不断被父母忽视和贬低的环境中，她的父母看不到她的任何成就。这在她内心留下了一个深深的创伤：我不重要。此时，一个男性**NPD**出现了。他对这位女性产生了强烈的理想化。他开始猛烈地追求这位女性。他不断地说：在我眼中，你是独一无二的。你的家人根本不明白你有多么特别。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's take another, more common example. A woman grows up in an environment where she is constantly neglected and belittled by her parents, who don't see any of her achievements. This leaves a deep wound in her heart: 'I am unimportant.' At this point, a male NPD appears, developing a strong idealization of this woman. He begins to pursue her intensely, constantly saying: 'In my eyes, you are unique. Your family simply doesn't understand how special you are.'</p>
</details>

然而，这个男性**NPD**的赞美和恭维往往是空洞、夸张且廉价的，它并不具备任何可怕的魔力。例如，他对这位女性的感受、成长经历和经验——一个更复杂、更微妙的心理历程——缺乏理解和倾听的兴趣。他们总是急于用一些好听的词语，用高度概括、宽泛的词语去给对方下结论，例如勇敢、智慧、优秀、有个性等等。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, this male NPD's praise and compliments are often empty, exaggerated, and cheap; they don't possess any terrible magic. For example, he lacks interest in understanding and listening to this woman's feelings, upbringing, and experiences—a more complex and subtle psychological journey. Instead, he's always in a hurry to use some nice-sounding words, highly generalized, broad terms to draw a conclusion about the other party, such as courage, intelligence, excellence, and individuality, etc.</p>
</details>

尽管这些词语听起来很美好，但它阻碍了女性充分表达自己。她也无法给出具体的、可观察的细节来证明对方的独特性。例如，这个男人的赞美可能是前后不一、摇摆不定的。当这位女士符合他对知性女性的想象时，他会热情地赞美这位女士：多么有文化！
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Although these words sound beautiful, they blocked the woman from fully expressing herself. She couldn't give specific, observable details to prove the other party's uniqueness either. For example, this man's praise may be inconsistent and wavering. When this lady matched his imagination of an intellectual woman, he praised her enthusiastically: 'How cultured!'</p>
</details>

然而，当这位女性提出了他所不熟悉的观点，或者反驳他的想法时，他不想去思考。相反，他们开始批评对方思考不够成熟。同样的道理，他可能在赞美这位女性的独立和勇敢，但对于超出他理解范围的独立，他会表现出不耐烦。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, when the woman raised a viewpoint he was unfamiliar with or refuted his ideas, he didn't want to think about it. Instead, he started criticizing the other party for not thinking maturely enough. By the same principle, he might be praising the woman for her independence and courage, but for independence that is beyond his understanding, he would be impatient.</p>
</details>

因此，这种基于“理想化”的赞美本身，并非真的那么理想；相反，它就像**叶公好龙**（比喻口头上说爱好某事物，实际上却并非真正爱好，甚至害怕）一样，脆弱且前后不一。正是因为这种理想化存在如此多的缺陷，因此，这样的**NPD**并不具备无条件蛊惑对方的能力。这种蛊惑并非源于他自身所拥有的任何魔力，而是仅限于那些相信这种幻象的人才有效。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, this kind of praise based on "idealization" itself is not really that ideal; instead, it's like Lord Ye's love of dragons—he only paid lip service to them. Fragile and inconsistent. It is precisely because this idealization has so many flaws that such NPDs do not possess the ability to unconditionally sway the other party. This kind of bewitching isn't due to any magic he possessed on his own; rather, it is effective only for those who believe in this illusion.</p>
</details>

### 外部责任与内部责任：摆脱受害者心态的关键

那么，说到这里，有些人可能会说：“Anthony的观点，这难道不是在指责受害者吗？难道是在要求受害者表现得完美无缺吗？”当然，这是一种误解。我们需要在这里区分两种责任：外部责任和内部责任。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, having said that, some people might say, 'Anthony's view, isn't this blaming the victim? Is it demanding that the victim behave perfectly?' Of course, this is a misunderstanding. We need to distinguish between two types of responsibility here: external and internal responsibilities.</p>
</details>

外部责任，就是我们通常所理解的伦理或法律责任。如果一个人只是在正常地行使自己的权利，却被另一个人欺骗和伤害，那么受害者当然是100%无辜的。无需承担任何责任。这不能用“苍蝇不叮无缝的蛋”这种说法，用这种话语去混淆是非。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">External responsibility is what we usually understand as ethical or legal responsibility. If someone was simply exercising their rights normally, but was deceived and hurt by another person, then the victims are, of course, 100% innocent. There is no need to bear any responsibility. This cannot be explained by the saying 'flies don't land on eggs without cracks' or by using such words to confuse right and wrong.</p>
</details>

而我们所说的内部责任，指的是精神层面的责任。它与过错无关，没有人有权去指责。它是一种存在主义的责任。从这个意义上讲，人无时无刻不拥有责任。我们无需为自己所遭受的客观伤害承担责任。但我们在受到伤害之后，我们如何自救？那是我可以承担责任的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what we call internal responsibility refers to responsibility at the spiritual level. It has nothing to do with fault, and no one has the right to criticize it. It is an existential responsibility. In this sense, people have responsibilities at every moment. We don't need to take responsibility for the objective harm we suffer, but after we were hurt, how do we save ourselves? That is something I can take responsibility for.</p>
</details>

外部责任是有条件的。它取决于我在这个社会中的具体能力、身份、位置等等。例如，我不是消防员，因此我没有责任冲进火场去救人。我的能力越大，需要承担的责任就越多……而内部责任，则是无条件的。它是基于我的自我觉察，这个不言自明的事实：我是一个能够反思自身处境的主体。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">External liability is conditional; it depends on my specific abilities in this society, identity, location, etc. For example, I am not a firefighter; therefore, I have no responsibility to rush into the fire to save people. The greater my ability, the more responsibilities one has to bear. Internal responsibility, on the other hand, is unconditional. It is based on my self-awareness, this self-evident fact that I am a subject capable of reflecting on my own situation.</p>
</details>

即使我放弃了自我觉察，那也是我基于自身的自我觉察所做出的放弃选择。因此，我依然要为此承担责任。这意味着所谓的脑控、精神控制、洗脑等等，它们永远无法完全、绝对地控制一个人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even if I give up my self-awareness, that was also a choice I made to give up based on my own self-awareness. Therefore, I still have to take responsibility for this. This means so-called mind control, brainwashing, etc., can never completely and absolutely control a person.</p>
</details>

### 精神控制的本质与自我分化

我经常听到一些朋友谈到，自己经历了严重的被操控感。例如，觉察到自己的一举一动，都带着迫害者的痕迹。那个迫害者的声音和思想，在自己的内心深处，每时每刻都在发布着指令。以至于自己什么都做不了，什么都干不成，一筹莫展。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I often hear some friends talk about experiencing a severe sense of being manipulated; for example, being aware that one's every move bears the marks of the persecutors, and the voice and thoughts of that persecutor are issuing orders in one's own heart every moment, so much so that one feels utterly unable to do anything, completely powerless.</p>
</details>

我理解，这些感受在心理层面上是100%真实的。它们也确实来源于现实世界的伤害。然而，它们永远无法完全决定一个人的精神。我们的生存环境，很多时候并非我们的选择，而是被“抛入”其中的。例如，我出生在一个糟糕的家庭，一个压抑的集体环境。或者想象一个更极端的情况：一个人被不公正地投入监狱或集中营。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I understand that these feelings are 100% real on a psychological level, and they do indeed stem from real-world harm. However, they can never completely determine a person's spirit. Our living environment is many times not our choice; instead, we are 'thrown into' it. For example, being born into a terrible family, a repressive collective environment, or imagine an even more extreme situation: a person is unjustly thrown into prison or a concentration camp.</p>
</details>

但即便在这种状态下，他至少仍然拥有一个选择：对待这种人生的态度，是消极接受还是积极反抗？即便只是在精神上。这时，有些朋友可能会说：“这些环境，难道不会对一个人造成心理创伤吗？”确实，我们频道中很多的视频都在讨论创伤，并将问题外部化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But even in this state, one at least still has a choice regarding their attitude towards this kind of life: is it passive acceptance or active resistance? Even if only in spirit. At this point, some friends might say, 'Wouldn't these environments cause psychological trauma to a person?' Indeed, many of the videos on our channel discuss trauma and externalize the problem.</p>
</details>

例如，将一个人的学习困难追溯到中国的教育，将某些焦虑或抑郁追溯到童年经历等等。然而，意识到这一点，并非是在暗示人类是无力的，完全被环境所决定。事实上，这种追溯和分析，恰恰是为了增加我们自身的能力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, tracing a person's learning difficulties back to China's education, or tracing certain anxieties or depression back to childhood experiences, etc. However, realizing this is not to suggest that humans are powerless and completely determined by the environment. In fact, this kind of tracing and analysis is precisely about increasing our own capabilities.</p>
</details>

例如，当我们分析原生家庭的创伤时，一个常见的误解是，个体发现“我的一举一动都是由父母决定的”，于是他去评判远方的父母，去对抗他们，或者说，去改变他们。这些行动当然可以存在。但最终，疗愈的目标依然是分化出自己。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, when we analyze trauma from the family of origin, a common misconception is that individuals discover, 'My every move is decided by my parents,' and then they go to judge their parents, who are far away, to confront them, or rather, to change them. These actions can certainly exist, but ultimately, the goal of treatment is still to differentiate oneself.</p>
</details>

在理解自身创伤之前，一个人的内心世界可能是一种混沌的状态。它充满了相互冲突的声音。一个是内在化的父母权威，它们是从过去与父母的互动中，所形成的异化了的自我，或者说，一个虚假的自我。这些虚假的自我，表面上是以自己的名义在发布指令。但实际上，它们是父母意志的代理人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before understanding one's own trauma, a person's inner world can be a state of chaos, filled with conflicting voices. One is internalized parental authority, the alienated self formed from past interactions with their parents, or rather, a false self. These false selves, on the surface, issue orders in one's own name, but in reality, they are agents of their parents' will.</p>
</details>

另一个是真实自我的声音。当事人无法区分这两种声音。当内心严苛的声音在心中回响时，他可能会误以为那是自己的想法，误以为“我真的很糟糕”，“不配拥有很多美好的东西”等等。然而，当我们对创伤获得洞察和觉察，能够日益将异化的自我，当做来自外部的异物去辨识时，我们真实自我的轮廓，就逐渐浮现了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other is the voice of the true self. The person involved could not distinguish between the two sounds. When the harsh voice within resounds in your heart, he might mistakenly believe that it was his own thought, mistakenly believing that 'I am really bad,' 'unworthy of many wonderful things,' etc. However, when we gain insight and awareness of trauma, and the ability to increasingly transform the alienated self when identified as a foreign object from the outside, the outline of our true self gradually emerges.</p>
</details>

真实自我是通过与异化自我的对比和分离，才能获得清晰的定义。表面上，这是一种将责任推给原生家庭的尝试。但本质上，这是一种对自身内心世界最终解释权和管理权的收回。这恰恰承担了最深刻的责任，它也是最强大的内部责任。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The true self is achieved through contrast and separation from the alienated self; only then can a clear definition be obtained. On the surface, this is an attempt to shift responsibility to one's family of origin, but essentially, this is a retraction of one's inner world's final interpretation and management rights. This is precisely what bears the most profound responsibility; it is also the most powerful internal responsibility.</p>
</details>

### NPD概念的泛化与受害者叙事的陷阱

这与受害者叙事的逻辑是完全不同的。在受害者的叙事中，**NPD**是一个能够实时控制我心智的人，而不是通过他在我内心的代理人。如果一个人相信，对方能够以一种神秘的外部方式，控制自己的心智，那么他生活的重心是什么？它将被放在与这个操控者的持续战斗中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is completely different from the logic of victim narratives. In the victim's narrative, NPD is someone who can control my mind in real time, rather than through his agent in my heart. If a person believes that the other can appear in a mysterious external way to control their own mind, then what is the focus of their life? It will be placed on the ongoing battle against this manipulator.</p>
</details>

那么他可能会发现，**NPD**似乎越来越普遍、无处不在，它就像一个幽灵，可能寄生在你身边的人，在任何一个人的身体里。例如，在这篇《识别男性NPD的50个特征》的文章中，**NPD**被划分为高功能和低功能两类，显性和隐性四个象限。更有甚者，拍照喜欢嘟嘴、睡觉磨牙喊叫、开车路怒，都被认为是**NPD**（Neutral Damage Disorder）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then he might find that NPDs seem to be increasingly prevalent and ubiquitous, like a ghost that may be parasitic on those around you, in any person's body. For example, in this article '50 Features to Identify Male NPD', NPDs are divided into high-function and low-function categories, dominant and recessive quadrants. Furthermore, even liking to purse one's lips when taking photos, grinding teeth and shouting in one's sleep, or road rage while driving, is considered an NPD (Neutral Damage Disorder).</p>
</details>

可以说，只要一个人的自我表现得稍微放松一点，这些都可能是**NPD**的表现。当个体感到外部世界充满了可怕的敌人，即便试图在**NPD**幸存者社区中寻求慰藉和支持，他们仍然不会感到安全。这场“革命”必须在这个小社区内部继续进行，分化派系并识别敌人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It can be said that as long as a person's self appears slightly more relaxed, these could all be manifestations of NPD. When an individual feels that the outside world is full of terrifying enemies, even trying to find solace and support within the NPD survivor community, they still won't feel safe. The 'revolution' must continue within this small community, dividing into factions and identifying enemies.</p>
</details>

例如，在**NPD**幸存者社区中，有人说：“要警惕那些批评**NPD**的博主，他本身可能就是**NPD**。”因为根据**NPD**的分类标准，潜伏型**NPD**的特征是，通过扮演受害者、抱怨、假装委屈，去试图获得同情和操控他人。按照这种说法，无论一个人的行为是自信还是自卑？是张扬还是内敛？是幸福还是不幸福？所有这些都可以被归类到某种**NPD**类型中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, in the NPD survivor community, some people said, 'Be wary of bloggers who criticize NPD; they may themselves be NPD.' Because according to the NPD classification standard, the characteristic of latent NPD is to try to gain sympathy and manipulate others by playing the victim, complaining, and feigning grievances. According to this statement, regardless of a person's behavior—whether confident or inferior, flamboyant or reserved, happy or unhappy—all of these can be categorized into a certain NPD type.</p>

最终，个体发现：“我好像自己也长成了一个**NPD**的样子。”这使得这个概念，它已经变成了一个包罗万象的，主体与客体不分化的**形而上学概念**（探讨事物本质、存在、宇宙起源等超越经验层面的哲学概念）。当标准变得如此模糊和主观时，我们当然可以在任何人身上，包括在我们自身中，找到它的影子。而这种驱魔仪式，这意味着它注定是一场永远无法获胜的战斗。它只会让所有人，陷入更深的猜疑和痛苦的内耗之中。

<p class="english-text">Ultimately, individuals discover, 'I seem to have grown into an NPD-like figure.' This brings the concept to the forefront, making it an all-encompassing, metaphysical concept where subject and object are not differentiated.

And this kind of exorcism ritual means it is destined to be a battle that can never be won; it will only make everyone fall into deeper suspicion and painful internal strife.</p>
