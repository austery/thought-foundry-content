</details>

>> 观众可能不知道，但我是一个狂热的职业摔跤迷，从小在田纳西州孟菲斯长大。在孟菲斯，我们小时候没有任何职业体育运动。我们只有孟菲斯州立大学老虎队的篮球和周一晚上在中南部体育馆的职业摔跤。基本上就是这些。杰瑞·劳勒（Jerry Lawler）在孟菲斯非常受欢迎，他甚至可以当选市长，我想他差点就成功了。所以，那真是一个摔跤小镇。我从小就看您和 WWE 的比赛，我想说 Triple H 是 **Attitude Era**（态度时代：WWE 在1990年代末至2000年代初的一个时期，以更成人化、叛逆和现实的故事情节为特色）的顶级反派冠军，是那个时代不可阻挡的力量。能邀请到您真是太棒了。从那时起，您就转型成为 WWE 的首席创意官，并拥有了巨大的商业成就。所以，我想和您谈谈这两方面的事情。也许我们先从您作为表演者的职业生涯开始。我不知道人们是否完全理解成为一名 WWE 超级巨星所需要的一切，但首先，您必须是一名出色的运动员。您是一名特技演员，因为您在做极其危险的事情。您必须能够进行 **promos**（宣传：摔跤手在比赛前或比赛中通过口头表演来推动故事情节、塑造角色或挑战对手），这意味着您基本上是一名演员，但您也必须自己撰写台词，而且您必须是一位对所有粉丝都充满魅力的明星。这其中包含了很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, the audience may not know this, but I'm a big professional wrestling fan, going back to my childhood in Memphis, Tennessee. In Memphis, we didn't have any professional sports growing up. All we had was Memphis State Tigers basketball and professional wrestling at the Midsouth Coliseum on Monday nights. That was pretty much it. Jerry Lawler was so popular in Memphis that he could have been elected mayor and I think he almost was. So, it was really a wrestling town. But, so growing up, I watched you and WWE and I would say that Triple H was the premier heel champion, the unstoppable force of the whole Attitude era. And it's a thrill to have you here. And since then, you've transitioned into being the chief creative officer at WWE and had a huge business career. So, I think we want to talk to you about both those things. Maybe let's start with your career as a performer. And I don't know if people understand everything that goes into being a WWE superstar, but you've got to be, first of all, you've got to be a tremendous athlete. You're a stunt man because you're doing tremendously dangerous things. You have to be able to cut promos, which means you're basically an actor, but you also have to write your own dialogue, and you've got to be a charismatic star to all the fans. There's a lot that goes into it.</p>
</details>

>> 有多少人适合这种工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How many people are cut out for this type of work?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，这是一件困难的事情。我现在工作中的一项任务就是寻找下一代明星。所以，我们通过大学体育、**NIL**（姓名、形象和肖像权：允许大学运动员通过自己的姓名、形象和肖像权获利的政策）项目以及许多其他途径，拥有一个强大的项目来寻找人才，但关键在于魅力以及您与生俱来与人建立联系的能力。我认为 WWE 令人瞩目的一点是，它结合了所有元素：运动能力、表演技巧、您必须具备的魅力，以及我们从第一天起就教授的媒体技能。当您离开 WWE 时，无论您在那里待了多久，或者取得了任何程度的成功，您都非常适合做生活中的任何事情，因为我真的觉得，对很多人来说，有时重要的不是您知道多少东西以及您有多擅长，而是您能让人们倾听您的魅力。如果您身边有合适的人，您就能拥有所需的一切，人们也会追随这种领导力。即使谈到政治，当我过去几个月多次走进白宫时，令我惊讶的是，白宫里有那么多 WWE 的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's a difficult thing. One of my tasks now in my job is finding that next generation of stars. So, we have a robust program through college athletics, through an NIL program, through a lot of different avenues where we find talent, but the key to it really is comes down to charisma and your innate ability to connect with people. It's one of the things about WWE that I think is remarkable is it is a combination of everything: the athleticism, the showmanship, the charisma that you have to have, the media skills that we teach from day one coming in the door, all of it. When you leave WWE, whether you've been there for a long time or, if you've been at any level of success, you are so well suited to do just about anything in life because I truly feel like for a lot of people sometimes can be a lot less about all the things you know and how good you are at them as the charisma to get people to listen to you. And then if you put the right people around you, you can have all the things that you need, but people will follow that leadership. Even when it comes to politics, it's amazing to me when I walk through the White House over the last few months, I've been there quite a few times, how many people in the White House are huge fans of WWE.</p>
</details>

>> 我在后台和您提过，但和戴维（David Sacks）类似，我在加拿大安大略省渥太华长大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mentioned this to you backstage, but similar to David, I had a growing up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

>> 那里真的没有什么职业体育运动。最终我们有了 NHL（国家冰球联盟），但它没有像孟菲斯那样引起轰动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There's really there wasn't any professional sports. Ultimately, we got the NH didn't get as big a pop as Memphis.</p>
</details>

>> 孟菲斯做到了。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Memphis did. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 我父亲和我的少数几个共同爱好之一就是摔跤，还有您，以及您从亨特·赫斯特·赫尔姆斯利（Hunter Hurst Helmsley）开始的整个发展历程，那真的就像戴维现在一样，然后您变得更像 Triple H。但我想问您一个关于您刚才所说的问题。我想请您描述一下唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）和巨石强森（The Rock）这两个人的特点，他们都在摔跤界拥有非常活跃的职业生涯，特朗普现在投身政治，而人们说巨石强森未来也可能从政。您刚才说，摔跤是培养魅力和与人建立联系的绝佳温床。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh, and my father and I, the one of the few things that we were able to bond over was wrestling and you and then your whole progression where you started off as Hunter Hurst Helmsley, which is really what David is like now, and then he became more of a, you know, more of the Triple Hel. But I wanted to ask you a question about exactly what you just said. And I want you to sort of walk us through the characteristics of these two individuals who have had a very vibrant career in wrestling, Donald Trump who's now in politics, and The Rock who people say may actually go into politics later. And what you just said is it's an incredible breeding ground for charisma and connecting with people.</p>
</details>

### 魅力、政治与角色演变

>> 是的，我的意思是，我认为如果您回顾历史，即使在政治领域，您会发现每个总统选举周期中当选的人，都是舞台上最有魅力的人。议题很重要，所有那些对人们来说重要的现实日常事务当然都在那里，但归根结底，他们选择的是他们喜欢的人。他们选择的是能与他们产生共鸣的人。他们选择的是对他们有魅力的人。唐纳德·特朗普在我们的 WWE 世界中表现非常好，因为他敢于做自己。他敢于有时出丑和尴尬。他敢于把一切都展现出来，做真实的自己。但他很有魅力。他超凡脱俗。他敢于说出自己所想，无论对错。巨石强森也是如此。这种与人的联系，在我看来，是推动这个世界的力量。所以在摔跤中，基本上有**反派**（heels：在职业摔跤中扮演坏人角色，通过欺骗、作弊或攻击性行为来激起观众的负面情绪）和**正派**（babyfaces/faces：在职业摔跤中扮演好人角色，通常以公平竞争、勇敢和受观众喜爱的方式出现），或者一些变体。在当今世界，很少有完全的好人或完全的坏人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, I think if you go back through history, even in politics, and you look at the person that gets elected in every presidential cycle, it's the most charismatic person on that stage that gets elected president. The issues are important. All the, you know, the real life day-to-day things that are important to people obviously are there, but at the end of the day, they're picking who they like. They're picking who connects with them. They're picking who is charismatic to them. Donald Trump was very good in our world of WWE because he was okay to be himself. He was okay to sort of get egg on his face and be embarrassed sometimes. He was okay to put it all out there and just be him. But he's charismatic. He's larger than life. He's not afraid to say what's in front of him, right or wrong. The Rock is the same way. That connection with people is really, in my mind, it is what drives the planet. So in wrestling there's basically heels and baby faces or faces or some variation. Nobody in today's world there's very few all the way good all the way bad.</p>
</details>

>> 对，实际上这种变化始于态度时代。我记得在 80 年代我小时候，霍克·霍根（Hulk Hogan）就像一个超级英雄式的正派人物。然后，我奇怪地总是支持反派。然后冷石史蒂夫·奥斯汀（Stone Cold Steve Austin）出现了，他有点像反派，但突然所有人都开始支持他，这到底是怎么回事？是美国社会发生了变化，还是产品变得更复杂了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right, and actually that sort of started to change in the attitude era. I remember in the 80s when I was growing up Hulk Hogan was like this superhero type, yes, you know, baby face, and then, you know, I weirdly always just rooted for the heels. And then Stone Cold</p>
</details>

>> 你更有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you're more fun</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这更有趣。我认为人们对世界的真实运作方式变得更加精明。没有人是完美的。我也不认为有任何人是，嗯，我不应该说任何人。世界上当然有些人是邪恶的，但大多数人，普通人，有些人真的很好，但其中总有一些可能不那么好的地方，反之亦然。我认为我对自己现在所做的事情有一个说法：只要坏人，也就是反派，在他自己的脑海中认为他所做的是正确的，那就会造就最好的反派。因为如果世界上 90% 的人不同意你，但你相信“不，你们都错了。我看到了这一点，它是正确的”，你就可以沿着这条路走下去。你不是仅仅想成为那个留着小胡子、把人绑在铁轨上的坏人反派。它是真实的。你感受得到，它是真实的，这就是你想要达到那个地方的原因。对大多数人来说，无论对错。所以，那些灰色地带，我不知道我们 WWE 是否必然引领社会，我也不想这么认为，但我认为我们反映了社会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's more fun and then Stone Cold Steve Austin came along and he kind of was a heel but all of a sudden everyone's like rooting for him like what happened there and like did something change in American society or did the product get more sophisticated? I think people became more savvy to how the world really works. Nobody's perfect. And I don't think there's anybody that is, well, I shouldn't say anybody. There's certainly people that are just evil in the world, but most people, the average person, there are people that are really good, but somewhere in there, there's some stuff that maybe isn't and vice versa on that. I think I have a saying in what I do right now. As long as the bad guy, the heel is justified somewhere in his mind that what he is doing is right, that leads to the best heal. Right? It because if 90% of the world disagrees with you, but you believe no, you're all wrong. I see this and it is right. You can you can run down that road. You're not just trying to be the, you know, the curl your mustache bad guy heel tying people to the railroad tracks. It's real. You feel it and it's real and it's why you want to get to that place. Right or wrong for most people. So that the shades of gray, I don't know that we necessarily lead society WWE. I wouldn't want to think that, but I think we reflect it.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，你们在 80 年代和 90 年代做得非常好，你们会利用地缘政治。我不知道这是否是刻意为之。你们会塑造一个角色，然后说：“嗯，我们得想办法谈谈中东。”所以，好吧，我们有了铁酋长（Iron Sheik）。你们会创造这些反映当时地缘政治紧张局势的角色。您觉得在这一代做起来更难了吗？或者现在做起来更难，仅仅是因为仍然有很多潜在的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, you did a very good job in the 80s and 90s where you would take the geopolitics. I don't know if this was by design. And you take a character and you'd say, "Well, we need to talk about the Middle East somehow." So, okay, we have the iron chic, right? And you'd create these characters that would reflect the geopolitical tension of the time. Do did you find that that was harder to do in this generation or is it harder to do now just because there's still so many potholes or</p>
</details>

>> 绝对是。我只是觉得，如果你把某人刻板地归类到某个特定地方，世界上很多人都会反抗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely. I just think that if you stereotyped somebody into a particular place, a lot of the world would rebel against that.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 对，不是以积极的方式。有时甚至是一些没有真正理由对此持任何立场的人，对吗？WWE 的一个特点是，我们是世界的一个有趣的反映。它应该是有趣的。它应该是娱乐。它应该是奇幻的。它应该让您来参加一个活动 3 小时，然后放松下来，享受娱乐和周围世界某种形式的呈现。但人们有时会沉迷其中，开始把这些呈现看得太认真。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. Not in a positive way. And maybe sometimes people that have no real reason to have a position on either side of that, right? The one thing about WWE is we're a fun reflection of the world. It's supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be entertainment. It's supposed to be fantastical. It's supposed to let you come to an event for 3 hours and just turn off and enjoy entertainment and some type of representation of the world that is around you. But people get lost in it and they begin to take the representations too seriously sometimes.</p>
</details>

### 摔跤与综合格斗：叙事与竞技的对比

>> 那么，您能对比一下 WWE 和 MMA（综合格斗：一种结合了多种格斗技巧的全面搏击运动）吗？长期以来，我因为对摔跤的迷恋，很难转向 MMA，但 MMA 确实已经占据了很大一部分时代精神，尤其是在年轻男性群体中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So then can you contrast and compare then maybe WWE and for a long time I had a really hard time because of my fascination with wrestling migrating to MMA but MMA has really taken over a lot of the zeitgeist especially amongst younger generations of men.</p>
</details>

>> 您是否感到压力，要让它变得更具肢体性，或者更像 MMA？或者您认为这两者在美国社会中扮演着怎样的角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you feel pressure to make it more physical or more like it or how do you think these two things play in what what role do they play I guess maybe in American society?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为它们是完全相反的。MMA 只是竞争。它就是竞争。它就是基于此。当康纳·麦格雷戈（Conor McGregor）出现时，你可以看看那个世界，我不想深入他们的世界，但如果康纳·麦格雷戈明天宣布复出，并说他四个月后要比赛，那将是巨大的轰动，对吧？会吸引大量的人，门票销售，收视率都会非常高。他上次比赛是什么时候？他上次赢是什么时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think they're total opposites. Like MMA is just it's competitive. It's competition. It's that's what it's based on. Though best when and and you can look at that world and I don't want to get too deep into their world, but you have a Conor McGregor come along. If Conor McGregor came out of retirement tomorrow and and said he's fighting in four months, it would be massive, right? The amount of people that would gravitate towards that, the ticket sales, the viewership would be intense. When's the last time he fought and when is the last time he won?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Mhm.</p>
</details>

>> 我甚至都说不出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I couldn't even tell you.</p>
</details>

>> 已经很久了。人们购买的是那种个人魅力崇拜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's forever. What people are buying is that cult of personality.</p>
</details>

>> 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right.</p>
</details>

>> 对。在我们的行业也是一样。我们讲故事。我不太，有时我们行业内的人会误解这一点。但我们不是根据“那会是一场精彩的比赛”来编写节目的。我们是根据我们能创造的故事来编写的。主角、反派，他们如何相互作用？讲述能引起人们共鸣的故事，也许是他们在现实生活中经历过的某种奇幻版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. It's the same in our business. We tell stories. I'm less and people within our business sometimes take this wrong. But I don't we don't write the shows based on that'll be a great match. We write it on the stories that we can create. The protagonist, the antagonist, how does that work with each other? Telling stories that can resonate with people that maybe they've experienced in their real life, some type of fantastical version of that.</p>
</details>

>> 那么有编剧室吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so is there a writer room?</p>
</details>

>> 有编剧室。我们有大量的员工。这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There is a writer room. We have a large staff of That's awesome.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，Netflix 上现在有一部名为《虚幻》（Unreal）的节目，它首次让我们看到了我们幕后的工作。我们允许摄像机进入编剧室。我们让他们进入我们节目的后台，这样您就能看到节目的制作过程。您会看到其中投入了什么。你知道，有很多个月的规划。我们现在正在展望四月份在拉斯维加斯举行的 **WrestleMania**（摔跤狂热大赛：WWE 每年举办的旗舰级付费观看赛事），以及那些比赛会是什么样子，以及我们想如何达到那里。随着时间的推移，故事情节的弧线是什么，能把我们带到那里？我想说，我们更像漫威宇宙，在那里您需要长期规划电影的契合点以及它们如何与所有角色配合，而不是像 MMA 那样直接。归根结底，MMA 或者 UFC，您是在安排比赛，兴趣在于“那个人真的很棒，他也很棒。我不确定谁会赢。让他们打一场吧。”当您让合适的个性参与进来时，它就会爆发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, there there's a show right now on Netflix called Unreal and it is for the first time ever a look behind the scenes at what we do. We let cameras into the writer room. We let them backstage at our shows so you see the production of the shows. You see what goes into it. You know, there's months of planning that go into stuff. We're we're looking now at WrestleMania in Vegas in April and what those matches are going to be and how we want to get there. What is the storyline arc that takes us there over time? I would say we're much more akin to like the Marvel universe where you're planning out long-term where the movies fit and how they go with all the characters than we are, you know, direct MMA at the end of the day. Direct MMA is or, you know, UFC, it's you're booking matches and the interest is that guy's really good, he's really good. I'm not sure who's going to win. Let's put them together. When when you get the right personalities involved, then it explodes.</p>
</details>

>> 保罗，我想回到这个标志性的态度时代，这也是我们称之为“查马斯（Chamath Palihapitiya）在扑克游戏中喝下第三杯红酒”的时候。

<p class="english-text">>> Paul, I want to go back to this iconic attitude era, which is also what we call it when Chim has his third glass of red wine at the poker game.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 情况变得有点火爆。嗯，它变得非常肢体化，有这种后院摔跤，还有这部令人难以置信的标志性电影《摔跤手》（The Wrestler）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It gets a little spicy. Um, it got very physical and there's this sort of backyard wrestling and there's this incredible iconic movie, The Wrestler.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

>> 这确实会给你的身体带来负担，尽管你没有进行完全接触。它给你的身体带来了什么负担？当你们在空中飞跃 10 英尺、15 英尺，以我不知道你们最大体重是多少，两三百磅的纯肌肉落地时，膝盖、背部，整个身体会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This does take a toll on your body although you're not making full contact. What what toll has it taken on your body? What toll does it take when you guys are soaring 10 feet 15 feet in the air at I don't know what you are at max weight two 300 lb of just muscle landing like what happens to your knees your back the whole thing.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。这是一项体力活。我们行业里有几句俗语。第一，这不是芭蕾舞，对吧？嗯，这并不是贬低芭蕾舞，因为我做不到。尽管很多人想看我尝试。嗯，这是一项体力活，没有人能毫发无损地离开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. It's a physical business. We have we have a few sayings in our business. One, it isn't ballet, right? Um and and that's not to knock ballet because I couldn't do that. Uh though many people would want to see me try. Um, it's it's a physical business and no one walks away unscathed.</p>
</details>

>> 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right.</p>
</details>

>> 对。但我们拥有可能是体育界最完善的医疗项目之一。所以我们不断地对一切进行扫描。嗯，你知道，身体上，以及头部受伤，所有的一切。所以我们在这方面做得非常好。以前不一定是这样。随着情况的改善，我们已经达到了这个水平。嗯，你知道，我们行业的诀窍是让它看起来非常具有肢体性，但实际上并没有那么具有肢体性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. But we have probably one of the most robust medical programs in athletics. Um, so we're scanning constantly for everything. Um, you know, physically as well as head injuries, everything, right? So we're way on top of that. Didn't necessarily used to be that way. As things have improved, we've gotten there. Um, you know, the the trick in our business is to make it look incredibly physical without being incredibly physical.</p>
</details>

>> 这正是我要说的，你知道，萨克斯（David Sacks）一直以来的梦想。他昨天在排练时告诉我们，他一直梦想参与摔跤。他觉得那是一条他没能走上的职业道路。那么，有没有办法，你知道，鉴于你所做的，你现在能把萨克斯举起来吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's where I was going with this is, you know, it's been Sax's dream. He was telling us when we were doing the show notes yesterday during the rehearsal, it's been Sax's dream all this time to be involved in wrestling. He feels like it was like a career path he didn't get to take. So, is there any way, you know, given what you've done that you could lift sacks right now?</p>

<p class="english-text">>> you got to sign a waiver.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我会签的。斯蒂芬（Steph），我们走吧。我们看到媒体和内容普遍存在很多分化。现场活动正在赚取巨额资金，无论是音乐会还是篮球比赛，这些行业都在看到收入和利润的增长。而传统的广播虚构内容则在消亡，比如利润率不高，收视率下降。这种分化对你的业务，即数字内容和你正在做的数字内容，与现场活动之间，是如何运作的？数字内容在一段时间内会是业务中不断增长的一部分吗？或者它真的只是一种现场体验？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I I'll sign Steph. Let's go. We see a lot of bifurcation happening generally in media and content. The live events are just making so much money, whether it's concerts or basketball games, and those industries are seeing revenue and profits kind of escalate. And then the traditional broadcast fiction's kind of dying, like the margins aren't there, the viewership's down. How is the bifurcation work for for for your business digital and kind of like the content stuff that you're doing digitally versus the live and like is digital still is digital going to be like a growing piece of the business for some time do you think or is it really a live experience?</p>
</details>

### WWE 的商业模式：现场体验与数字驱动

>> 嗯，它是一种现场体验，但我认为所有这些东西都会把你引向现场体验。那么，你在哪里讲述故事，让你想去参加现场活动呢？我们在数字平台上讲述这些故事。我们在全球拥有大约十亿的社交媒体粉丝。我们是最大的社交媒体存在之一。我不是一个统计数据专家，所以我可能会搞砸一些，但我们是所有体育项目中排名第一的 YouTube 频道。我不知道我们在哪里，但我们在所有 YouTube 频道中排名前十。嗯，你知道，我们的社交媒体影响力是首屈一指的。这些能自己变现吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's a live experience but I think all those things lead you to the live experience. So where do you tell the stories that get you to want to go to the live event? We tell those stories across digital platforms. We have right around a billion social media followers across the globe. We're one of the the largest social presence. Um I I'll I'm not a stat guy, so I'll screw some of this up, but uh number one YouTube channel across all sports. Um I I'm not sure where we're at, but we're in the top 10 of YouTube channels across everything. Um you know, our social presence is second to none. those monetize on their own or</p>
</details>

>> 它们确实能变现，但我们也把它们视为所有其他事物的驱动力。所以我们的产品现在在美国国内通过 Netflix 播放，但在全球其他地方也通过 Netflix 观看。所以在美国以外，Raw、Smackdown 和我们所有的节目都在全球 Netflix 上播放。周一晚上在全球 Netflix 上，周二晚上，**NXT**（WWE 的发展联盟，培养未来明星）就像我们的 AAA 棒球或大学橄榄球，它通过 CW 交叉广播。周五晚上，我们仍在 USA 频道与 NBCU 合作。我们有 Peacock 上的周六夜主赛事。我们刚刚做了。

<p class="english-text">>> they they do they do monetize but we also see them as drivers to everything else right so our products now raw airs domestically in the US on Netflix but dem um is viewed globally on Netflix every place else right so outside of the US Raw Smackdown all our shows are on Netflix globally Monday nights on Netflix globally Tuesday nights uh NXT which is our our sort of um AAA baseball or our college football if you would that that airs on the CW cross broadcast. Um Friday nights we're on USA uh with NBCU still. We have Saturday night's main event on Peacock. We just did</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Does your audience still have an affinity for live? Are they still big into</p>
</details>

>> 百分之千。所以我们最大的活动是 **PLEs**（高级现场赛事：WWE 的主要付费观看赛事，通常在体育场或大型竞技场举行）。我们刚刚做了一个改变游戏规则的宣布，我们将把它们转移到 ESPN，从现在开始。你知道，没有人能像 ESPN 那样大规模地举办活动。所以这对我们来说将是巨大的。嗯，你知道，我们一直走在前沿。当 WrestleMania 开始时，它是闭路电视播放的。你知道，我们开创了闭路娱乐，你可以去电影院观看广播。我们开创了付费观看行业。当流媒体刚刚兴起时，我们是第一批进入者之一，我们有自己的 WWE 网络。所以当时有点像 Netflix 和我们。嗯，我们后来意识到，随着时间的推移，那将是一场我们不适合的科技战。那不是我们所做的。我们退出了。我们转到了 Peacock。嗯，我们现在在 Netflix 上。我们在 ESPN 上。你知道，我们无处不在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> one 1,000%. So our our biggest events are PLE's. We just did a a game-changing announcement where we're we're moving them over to ESPN here starting up and you know nobody does largecale build to events like ESPN does. So that will be massive for us. Um you know we've always sort of been in the forefront of that. When when WrestleMania started, it was um closed circuit, you know, we we pioneered closed circuit entertainment where you would go to a theater and watch the broadcast. We pioneered pay-per-view industry when streaming was just coming into play. We were one of the first movers into we had our own WWE network. So when it it was kind of Netflix and us um we then realized that over time that's going to be a tech war that we're not suited for. It's not what we do. We pulled out of that. We went over to Peacock. Um we're now on Netflix. We're on ESPN. You know, we're across the board.</p>
</details>

>> 您能带我们了解一下这次谈判的幕后情况吗？因为你们刚刚签署了一份巨大的授权协议。也许您想告诉大家它的规模，但你们是如何让各方相互竞标的，以及不同的人想要什么不同的东西？

<p class="english-text">>> Can you just bring us behind the scenes in this negotiation because you guys just signed a huge licensing deal. Maybe you want to tell folks the size of it, but how did you bid people against each other and what were the different things that different folks wanted?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我们最棒的一点是，凭借我们制作的内容量，我们每年有 52 周的现场直播。所以，当您谈论一家制作娱乐内容的媒体公司时，我们周一晚上在 Netflix 上直播两到三个小时，具体取决于晚上。周二晚上在 CW 上直播两小时，周五晚上直播两小时，每年有一半时间在 USA 频道直播三小时。嗯，你知道，每月一次超过三小时的 PLE，每年一次或多次的周六夜主赛事，所有这些都是现场直播，所有这些都是我们定期发布的内容。回到现场活动体验，我们的现场活动，你知道，我们的票务，我们的现场活动体验数据都非常惊人，而且是全球性的。我们刚刚在巴黎，嗯，我们在巴黎的体育场举行了活动。嗯，我们在周五晚上在法国里昂举行了活动，周日晚上在法国巴黎的一个体育场举行了 PLE，那里有超过三万人。然后我们周一晚上在巴黎的同一个体育场举行了《Raw》的电视直播，第二天晚上有两万多人观看，然后直接返回美国。所以，每周都有如此多的现场内容。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Well, the the beautiful thing about us is with the amount of content we do, we're 52 weeks a year live. So, when you when you talk about a content company that puts out entertainment, we are live Monday nights uh two to three hours depending on on the on the evening on Netflix. Tuesday nights two hours on CW, Friday nights, two hours and half the year is three hours on USA. uh you know once a month a 3hour plus PLLE uh Saturday night's main event quarterly or more per year that's that's all live that's all content that we're putting out on a regular basis um to go back to the live event experience our live event you know our ticketing our live event experience numbers are off the chart and that's global we were just in Paris um we did the stadium in Paris uh we did Leon France on a Friday night, a PLE on a Sunday night in a stadium in Paris, France, where we had 30 plus thousand there, and then we did U Monday Night Raw from Paris in that same stadium with a little over 20,000 there for TV the next night, came straight back to the US. So, it's it's every single week that amount of live content.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's incredible. 500 hours a year.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。但观看我们的方式是现场直播。嗯，这会暴露我的年龄。如果有人是 Kiss 乐队的粉丝，Kiss 在 70 年代是世界上最热门的现场表演乐队，但他们不卖专辑。他们认为，如果有一种方法能让人们在专辑中体验我们的现场表演，那将改变我们的游戏规则。他们做了一张现场专辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. But the way to see us is live. Uh, this will date me. And if anybody is a fan of the band Kiss, Kiss when they were in the 70s were like the hottest live act in the world, but they weren't selling albums. They thought if there's a way we could just get people to experience what we do live on an album, it will change the game for us. They did a live one.</p>
</details>

它爆发了。当现场专辑不卖任何东西时，因为它捕捉了他们的现场表演。对我们来说也是一样。我一直都这么说。如果我们想培养一个 WWE 粉丝，如果我们与一个合作伙伴合作，他们有点犹豫不决，或者他们对我们所做的事情不太感兴趣，我们会带他们去体验我们的现场表演。我们会带他们去 WrestleMania。我们会带他们去体育场表演。我们会带他们去竞技场活动。当有三万人到五万、六万、八万人在体育场里疯狂时，那种感觉是电光火石的。你不可能离开那里然后说“嗯”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It exploded. When when live albums didn't sell anything because it captured them live. It's the same for us. I say I I say this all the time.

We bring them to a stadium show. We bring them to an arena event. And when you have 30,000 people to, you know, 50, 60, 80,000 people in a stadium going insane, it is electric. there is no way that you leave there and go eh</p>

>> 而且，你知道，尤其是共享体验。所以当你谈到你和你父亲的关系时，那是你们的共同点。我一直听到这种说法。我们超过 50% 的观众是带着孩子、带着家人来的。我们 40% 的粉丝是女性。如果你想从这个角度看，我们是最多样化的体育或娱乐产品之一。但我最喜欢的是，当我在举办活动时，我看着人群，摄像机扫过人群，我清楚地看到祖父带着他们的孩子和孙子们坐在一起，为节目而疯狂。你知道，你知道那位祖父喜欢布鲁诺·圣马蒂诺（Bruno San Martino），父亲喜欢巨石强森（The Rock）或冷石（Stone Cold），而现在的孩子们喜欢罗曼·雷恩斯（Roman Reigns）或莉娅·里普利（Ria Ripley）。这太棒了。它将家庭联系在一起。它给了他们一些可以一起享受的东西。那些共享的体验。

<p class="english-text">>> and you know especially shared experience so when you talk about, you know, your relationship with your dad. That was your thing. I hear that all the time. 50% or more of our audience comes with a child, come comes with a family member. 40% of our our our fan base is women. We're one of the most diverse sports, if you want to look at it that way, or entertainment products out there. But the thing that I love the most is when I look in the crowd, when I'm running an event, I'm in the back and they're panning that crowd on camera and I see what I clearly see as a grandfather with their kids and their grandkids sitting all together freaking out over the show. And you know, you know that grandfather was into a Bruno San Martino and the dad was into The Rock or or Stone Cold and the kids now are into Roman Reigns or Ria Ripley or, you know, um it's it it's amazing. And it binds families together. It gives them something to enjoy together. and those those shared experiences.</p>

>> 是的。嗯，而且它非常注重身体，你也是在身体活动中长大的。我们需要把这一点改回来，让人们意识到身体活动中蕴含着乐趣，身体活动中蕴含着成功。对我来说，小时候我第一次走进健身房，认识了阿诺德·施瓦辛格（Arnold Schwarzenegger），我把他视为有史以来最伟大的美国成功故事之一。他小时候脑海中就有一个蓝图，他看到了什么。他看到了一位名叫雷格·帕克（Rege Park）的健美运动员，心想，我遵循那个蓝图。我将成为雷格·帕克那样的人。我将成为有史以来最伟大的健美运动员。我将进入好莱坞。我将掌控好莱坞。然后我将进入政界，我将做得很好。他看到了这个蓝图。他做到了。我看到了我自己的那个蓝图。但教会我做这些事情的是体育。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um and and it was very physical and you grew up physical. We need to change that back to people and and get them to realize that that physicality, there's enjoyment in that physicality and there's success in that physicality. One one thing for me when I was a kid and I first wandered into the gym and I learned who Arnold Schwarzenegger was, who I consider one of the great American uh success stories of all time. He he had a blueprint in his mind as a young kid of what he saw. He saw a a bodybuilder named Rege Park and thought to himself, I follow that blueprint. I'm going to be like Reg Park. I'm going to become the biggest bodybuilder of all time. I'm going to get into Hollywood. I'm going to take over Hollywood. Then I'm going to get into politics and I'm going to do right like he saw this blueprint. He did it. I saw that same blueprint for me, right? But what taught me to do those things was athletics.</p>

### 创意合作与模糊现实界限

>> 保罗，我问你。你心里有一个蓝图。我记得，我以前看过你的采访，当你刚进入这个行业时，你向肖恩·迈克尔斯（Shawn Michaels）和瑞克·弗莱尔（Ric Flair）这样的人学习，你是一个“比赛的学生”，然后你把这些融入到你的角色中。你的角色被称为“游戏”（The Game）。然后它达到了另一个层次。所以你显然，你知道，你在主导那个角色的发展，我认为当角色和你自己以某种方式融合时，它达到了另一个层次。我想问，这在你现在管理人才时，会带来怎样的创意摩擦？因为他们心中有自己的职业蓝图，但你作为整体创意负责人，有自己的方向。这会产生多少摩擦？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Paul, let me ask you. So, you had a blueprint in your mind. I remember, you know, I I've seen you interviewed before and when you were coming up in the business, you were learning from guys like Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair and you were a student of the game and then you incorporate that into your character. Your character was called the game. It then hit another level. So you clearly, you know, you were leading the development of that character and I think got over to another level when somehow the character and yourself somehow you hit some sort of Yeah. joined. I guess what does that do in terms of the creative friction that you deal with now running the talent because they have their own blueprints in their mind about where they want to go with their career but you as running the overall creative have a direction where they want to go how much friction does that create?</p>
</details>

它不会产生摩擦，它会产生合作关系，这就是我喜欢的地方。我最喜欢的工作部分之一就是和人才坐下来，说：“我们想去哪里？我们想和你一起去哪里？我们想如何到达那里？”这不是关于“我想成为冠军”的对话。好的。好的。每个人都想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it doesn't create friction it creates a partnership which is what I love that one of the favorite parts of my job is to sit down in a room with talent and say where do we want to go where do we want to go with you how do we want to get there it's not the conversation of well I want to be champion. Okay. Okay. Everybody does.</p>
</details>

>> 你的故事是什么？我们如何讲述它？这些其他人才中，谁的故事可以与你的弧线相悖，与他们的弧线结合，讲述一个精彩的故事？一旦我们开始即兴创作这些东西，今天的世界就不同了。回顾 40、50 年前，伊万·科洛夫（Ivan Kolaf）是一个扮演俄罗斯人的加拿大人，因为我们正处于冷战时期，那是很容易做到的事情。但你现在不能再塑造那样的角色了，因为互联网会说“他来自加拿大”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What is what is what is your story and how do we tell it? And who here of these other talent can have a story that goes against your arc to combine with their arc to tell a great story? Once we start to riff those things, today's world is different. You go back, you know, 40, 50 years, Ivan Kolaf was a Canadian guy that played a Russian because we were in the middle of a cold war and it was the easy thing to do. But you couldn't do that character now because the internet would go like he's from Canada, right?</p>
</details>

它行不通。他们知道真相。所以今天你必须将真实的自己与你扮演的角色融合，并模糊这条界限。模糊这种“**第四堵墙**”（fourth wall：戏剧和电影中虚构的、无形的墙，将演员与观众隔开）的界限，让人分不清那是真实的，还是这些人真的不喜欢对方，或者那真的是你。当我们在后台把这些东西组合在一起时，我们都同意我们想去哪里，然后我们讲述这个故事，让人们无法分辨什么是真实的，什么是虚构的，那时它就变得神奇了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It it doesn't work. They know the truth. So today you have to sort of blend who you are real life with the character that you play and sort of blur this line.
