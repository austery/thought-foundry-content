title: 约翰·坎迪：多伦多塑造的喜剧传奇与加拿大精神
---

### 约翰·坎迪在第二城的喜剧启蒙

Paul，非常感谢您来到多伦多**第二城**（Second City: 著名的即兴喜剧剧团）与我们交流。正如您所见，我们正坐在约翰·坎迪剧院里。他与这个机构有着非常特殊的关系，能和我们谈谈吗？我身下的这个舞台，正是约翰·坎迪在第二城开启职业生涯的地方，他差点就错过了这个机会，因为他本来没打算去第二城试镜。但是丹·艾克罗伊德和瓦莱丽·布拉姆菲尔德当时正在试镜，他们是他的朋友，就对他说：“和我们一起去试镜吧，你可以在后面坐着，之后我们一起吃午饭。”然后他们就叫了他的名字，他当时心想：“你们这些家伙！”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Paul, really appreciate you joining us here at Second City Toronto. Uh, as you can see, we're sitting in the John Candy Box Theater. He had a very special relationship with the institution. Tell me about it. Well, this stage underneath me is part of the building where John Candy started at Second City and it started his career and he almost didn't do it because he wasn't really going to audition for Second City, but uh Dan Akroyd and Valerie Bramfield were auditioning and they were friends of his and they said, "Come with us to the auditions. You can just sit in the back and we'll have lunch afterwards." And and then they called his name and he's like, "You guys."</p>
</details>

就是这样，他因为一次即兴表演而进入了剧团，他以前从未尝试过，结果发现他天生就是这块料。您提到了地板，这些就是他曾经表演过的地板。您第一次进来的时候，做的第一件事就是敲了敲地板。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so that's what started he got in because he just did an improv. never tried it before and turns out he was a natural. Uh you mentioned the floors. These are the floors that he has performed on. When you first came in here, first thing that you did was you knocked on the floor.</p>
</details>

是的，我敲了敲地板。可以说，我们脚下这小块舞台，是许多喜剧巨匠的起点，坦白说，不仅仅是加拿大喜剧界。我们向世界输送了许多人才，比如丹·艾克罗伊德、吉尔达·拉德纳、我自己的兄弟迈克·迈尔斯，还有约翰·坎迪、尤金·列维、戴夫·托马斯，他们都是从这块舞台上开始的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I knocked on the floor. It's like this this little part of the stage underneath us is uh where so many of the greats of comedy frankly, not just Canadian comedy. We've exported these people like Dan Akroyd, like Gilder Rner, like my own brother Mike, you know, elephant in the room, uh, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, and they all got their start here, you know, on this piece of stage.</p>
</details>

### “多伦多约翰尼”的由来

“多伦多约翰尼”是许多人对约翰·坎迪的昵称。这个昵称是如何产生的呢？当坎迪最初在多伦多第二城崭露头角时，他虽然是众多演员之一，但无疑是一个个性十足的大人物。他生活豪迈，甚至会超支自己的银行账户，但他希望一切都尽善尽美。如果需要一辆豪华轿车，他就会租一辆。大家会问他：“约翰尼，你从哪里弄钱？”他会说：“哦，别担心。”他们开始给他起昵称，可能就是乔·弗莱厄蒂起的，他们开始叫他“多伦多约翰尼”，就像他拥有这座城市一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Johnny Toronto, that is the nickname that many know John Candy as. How did that start come about? So when Candy first starts dominating the Toronto Second City, you know, he was one of many, but he was definitely a big he was a big personality. Uh he lived large like he would uh he would outspend his own bank account, you know, but he wanted to have the right thing. So if they needed a limo for something, he would just rent a limo and they'd say, "Johnny, where are you going to get the money?" And you know, he was like, "Ah, don't worry about it." And they they started nicknaming it might have been Joe Flareity. They started calling him Johnny Toronto, like he owns the town,</p>
</details>

对吧？这是一个更长的故事，写在书里了，所以我不想在这里展开。在某种程度上，他确实拥有多伦多吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? And uh I it's a much longer story and it's in the book so I don't want to but in some ways he did he own Toronto?</p>
</details>

嗯，当他拥有**多伦多淘金人队**（Toronto Argonauts: 一支加拿大橄榄球队伍）的时候，我想是丹·艾克罗伊德转向人群中的某人说：“看他，人群爱他，他把**格雷杯**（Grey Cup: 加拿大橄榄球联赛的年度冠军奖杯）带回了家乡。”他们说：“他就是多伦多约翰尼。”他做到了，他成为了多伦多约翰尼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well by by the time he owned the Toronto Argonauts um I think it was Dan Akroyd turned to somebody in the crowd and said look at him the crowd loves him and this he brought the gay cup to his hometown and said he is they said he is Johnny Toronto. He he made it he became Johnny Toronto.</p>
</details>

### 深植加拿大：坎迪的自豪与奉献

约翰·坎迪取得了全球性的成功。我们可以列举一系列作品，比如《**SCTV**》（SCTV: 加拿大著名的电视喜剧节目）、《巴克叔叔》（Uncle Buck）、《飞机、火车和汽车》（Planes, Trains & Automobiles），对于年轻一代来说，还有《小鬼当家》（Home Alone）。但他始终深深扎根于加拿大。1991年，他与韦恩·格雷茨基共同拥有多伦多淘金人队，并赢得了格雷杯。您能谈谈他对加拿大的自豪感吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So John Candy achieved global stardom. Uh we can name a bunch SCV, Uncle Buck, Lan, Trains, and Automobiles for a younger generation would be Home Alone, but he still remained deeply rooted to Canada. Uh he was part owner of the Toronto Argonauts alongside Wayne Gretzky when they won the Great Cup in 1991. Can you talk to us about the pride he had for Canada?</p>
</details>

你知道，他像许多我们“出口”的人才一样，在洛杉矶的曼德维尔峡谷买了一栋房子，但在昆斯维尔也买了一个农场。所以他有一个牧场，他想确保他的家人了解加拿大的生活。他花了很多时间回到加拿大，与加拿大演员合作。他唯一执导的电影是《人质一日》（Hostage for a Day）。他邀请了许多人出演，比如来自第二城的罗宾·杜克，以及当时主舞台的一些演员，如约翰·亨普尔、唐·莱克、凯瑟琳·格林伍德。他真的想带着人们一起前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, he like so many of the people we export, he bought a house in Mandville Canyon in Los Angeles, but also a farm in Queensville. And so he had this ranch and he wanted to make sure that his family knew the Canadian life and and he spent a lot of time coming back and working with Canadian actors. Only film he directed was a film called Hostage for a Day. And he populated the cast with people like Robin Duke from Second City and some of the people who were in the the mainstage cast at the time like John Hemple, uh Don Lake, Katherine Greenwood, and he really wanted to bring people with him.</p>
</details>

治疗师说我们应该在关系中少一些嘲讽。嗯，治疗师是这么说的吗？我正在努力，只是我们的婚姻中有很多地方需要这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therapist said we should be a little less mocking in our relationship. Well, is that what the therapist said? Well, I'm trying. It's just that there's so much in our marriage that calls for it.</p>
</details>

他在加拿大非常努力地工作。他去世后上映的最后一部电影是《加拿大培根》（Canadian Bacon），对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He worked really hard in Canada. The last film that got released after his death was Canadian Bacon, right?</p>
</details>

这部电影讲述的是我们复杂的关系，现在这种关系似乎已经理清了，我们与美国之间不再有那么复杂的关系了。但是，你知道，我认为他确实在某种意义上感受到了两种忠诚，因为加利福尼亚和美国对他都很好。但你不知道，我住在加利福尼亚，我可以告诉你，你始终是加拿大人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is like about our complex relationship that that seemed to have cleared up. We don't have that complex relationship anymore uh with the United States. But, you know, I think he really felt the two allegiances in a sense cuz California had been good to him and America had been good to him. But you don't I'm I live in California. I can tell you you are Canadian the whole time,</p>
</details>

无论你身在何处，你首先都是加拿大人，你知道吗？我觉得我在读他的故事时，对此深有同感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, and no matter where you are, you're Canadian first and and I feel like I identified with that when I was reading about him.</p>
</details>

### 坎迪的生活哲学：欢乐、同理心与连接

您在书中写道：“他活得豪迈，爱得更深，世界也以爱回报他。”这很美。您能详细阐述一下吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You write in the book, he lived large, he loved larger, and the world loved him back in return. It's beautiful. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
</details>

嗯，你知道，这是对安德里亚·马丁在她自己的回忆录中所说的话的阐述。她谈到他是一个“欢乐的火山”。他想把他所到之处都充满快乐。所以，他也想让自己快乐。他的一部分快乐来自于与人连接。他每晚都会打好几个小时的电话。他喜欢举办派对。当然，这很多时候意味着他深夜还在吃喝，这不利于他的健康状况，但这一切都基于他渴望一直与人保持连接。我认为他进入喜剧界，是因为这是一种——这很奇怪，因为我说“控制”，但这不是一种坏的控制，而是你想做一些事情来影响整个房间，影响房间里的人。而喜剧在宏观上影响着许多人，但它也是一种一对一的事情。这只是一种寻找快乐的方式。而快乐是会传染的。一旦你给予快乐，其他人也会感到快乐。他们会传播开来，你知道，你甚至不必去思考。这只是它的一个理性化版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, it's elaborating on something Andrea Martin said in in her own memoir. She talked about how he was a volcano of joy. He wanted to make happiness for everywhere he went. So, he also wanted to be happy. So, part of his happiness came from connecting with people. He was on the phone for hours every night. He wanted to have after parties. Now, a lot of that meant that he was eating and drinking late at night, which didn't help his health condition, but it was all based on that wanting to be connected with people all the time. And I think he got into comedy uh because it was a way of it's it's weird because you I say control, it's not a bad kind of control, but you want to do something to uh affect the room, to affect the room or the person in that room. And comedy on a grand scale affects many people, but it also is a one-on-one thing. It's just a a way of finding joy. And joy is one of those things that it's contagious. Once you give joy, other people are joyful. They spend, you know, and you don't have to think that, by the way. That's an intellectualized version of it.</p>
</details>

我认为对于像约翰·坎迪这样的人来说，这是一种本能。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's an I think with an animal like John Candy was instinctive.</p>
</details>

### 坎迪对后辈的影响：迈克·迈尔斯与Paul Myers的喜剧之路

您在书中分享了一个可爱的轶事，您的兄弟，演员兼喜剧演员迈克·迈尔斯在多伦多大学校园里遇到了约翰·坎迪。能告诉我那次短暂的互动是如何影响一位喜剧演员的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You share uh a lovely anecdote in the book where your brother, actor, comedian Mike Myers uh met John Candy at the University of Toronto on campus. Uh tell me how that uh very short interaction kind of influenced uh a comedian. Yeah.</p>
</details>

好的。你知道，就像蜘蛛侠被放射性蜘蛛咬了一口一样，这是迈克的起源故事。所以，小弟弟迈克去看了一场喜剧表演。他还是个小孩子，有点搞笑。事实上，他非常搞笑，我们甚至不知道他有多搞笑。他在学校操场上就很搞笑，但他甚至不给我们看。然后他去对约翰·坎迪说，他当时还是个青少年，16或17岁，他说：“坎迪先生，我怎样才能进入喜剧界？”任何其他名人可能都会给他一些糟糕的建议，或者根本不给建议。而坎迪说：“市中心有一家剧院叫第二城，我就是从那里出来的。他们有工作坊，如果你去参加工作坊，你就能发现自己是否擅长，或者是否感兴趣。如果你不感兴趣，你就会退出，然后你会找到别的事情做。也许你会成为一名演员，也许你会成为一名音乐家，或者任何你想做的事情。”他说：“如果你擅长并且努力工作，你就会变得更好。你可能仍然不会被发现，但你会乐在其中，因为你热爱它。如果你热爱它，你就会继续做下去，你会变得更好，也许在某个时候你会做成一些事情。但首先要弄清楚你是否擅长，以及你是否热爱它，因为你必须热爱它。”这就像是最棒的建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. You know, similar to the way Spider-Man was bit by a radioactive [laughter] spider, this is Mike's origin story. So Mike Kid brother is like goes to this comedy show. He's a little kid. He's kind of funny. In fact, he was funny. We didn't even know he was how funny. He was funny on the schoolyard and he wouldn't even show us. And he goes and he says to John Candy, like he's a young teen. He's 16 or 17. He says, "Mr. Candy, sir, how do I get into comedy?" And any other celebrity would have given him possibly terrible advice or no advice. And you know, he Candy said, "There's there's a theater downtown called Second City that I came from. They have workshops and if you go to the workshops you can find out if you're any good if you or if you're interested and if you're not interested you'll drop out and you'll come up with something else. Maybe you'll be an actor maybe you'll be a musician uh or whatever you want to do. He goes and if you're good at it and you work hard you'll get better at it and you still might not get discovered but you'll be happy doing it because you love doing it and if you love doing it you'll keep doing it and you'll get better and maybe somewhere down the line you'll do something. But just find out first if you're any good and if you love it because you have to love it. Like that is like the most amazing advice.</p>
</details>

太棒了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Awesome.</p>
</details>

就像他在山顶遇到了大师，大师说了这些话。然后，这以一种奇怪的方式影响了我。这是我最近的一本书。我之前的书是《大厅里的孩子们：一个笨蛋》（The Kids in the Hall: One Dumb Guy）。大厅里的孩子们和我哥哥上的是同一个班。我在第二城工作坊遇到了大厅里的孩子们，因为迈克把我们都带到了第二城工作坊。所以当大厅里的孩子们开始走红时，我们彼此都认识。我写了他们的书，然后我写了约翰·坎迪的书。所以，这不仅开启了迈克非凡的职业生涯，我的职业生涯也以一种奇怪的方式，我现在成了记录所有这些事情的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's like he met, you know, on the mountain top, you know, the guru said. And so then here's how that affects me in a weird way. So this is my most recent book. My book before it was the kids in the hall, one dumb guy. The kids in the hall were in the the same classes that I went to because my brother went to. I met the kids in the hall at Second City Workshops because Mike had gotten us all to Second City Workshops. So when the kids in the hall started taking off, we all knew each other. I wrote their book and then I wrote the John Candy book. So not only did it start Mike's phenomenal career, but my career in a weird way has also like I am now the guy chronicling all those things.</p>
</details>

### 约翰·坎迪在加拿大流行文化中的不朽地位

今年本应是约翰·坎迪的75岁生日。约翰·坎迪在43岁时英年早逝。是什么让他即使在今天，仍然是加拿大流行文化中如此受人尊敬的人物？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This year would have marked his 75th birthday. Um John Candy passed away at 43 untimely. What makes him such a revered figure in Canadian pop culture even to this day?</p>
</details>

我认为，一方面，他本可以取得的成就被提前中断了，他本可以进入戏剧表演领域，可能还会执导更多电影，也许还有更多喜剧。也许他还会和他的**SCTV**同事们一起出演像《富家穷路》（Schitt's Creek）这样的作品。但约翰的缺席一直存在。认识他并了解他作品的人觉得他们仍然没有解决那种失落感。同时，他在作品中代表的价值观，我认为在今天非常需要：快乐、同理心、脆弱性。他代表了所谓的“普通人”，带着高贵的尊严，对吧？顺便说一句，丹·艾克罗伊德在书中一直用这些词来形容他。而这些价值观，在像《冰上轻驰》（Cool Runnings）这样的电影中，你知道，发生在卡尔加里奥运会期间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for one thing the when he was cut short of what he could have done, he would have gone into dramatic acting, possibly directing and maybe more comedies. Maybe he might have also have been in something like Shitz Creek with his fellow SCTV people. But the absence of John persists. people who knew him and knew his work felt like they still haven't resolved that loss. At the same time, what he represents in his work, values that I think are hugely needed today, joy, empathy, uh vulnerability, he represented uh the so-called common man with with noble dignity, right? Uh Dan Akroyd, by the way, in the book describes him in these kinds of terms all the time. and those values in in in a film like Cool Runnings which you know takes place at the Calgary Olympics</p>
</details>

当你冲过终点线时，你会知道这些家伙是从哪里来的。他谈论了很多我们都应该追求的价值观。你知道，在公共政策和人们的社交媒体上，有很多残酷的东西。当你看到一个为同理心和快乐而活的角色，他的脸就像一个灯塔，他那闪烁的眼睛。所以，如果这个角色不是他发明的，如果他不存在，我们都得虚构一个这样的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you cross that finish line where did THESE GUYS COME FROM you'll know he talks a lot about values that we should I think we should all aspire to and you know there's a lot of cruelty in public policy in places and in people's you know social media when you see a character who lived for empathy and joy and his face is like a beacon of that these twinkling eyes of So it's like if you didn't invent this character, if he didn't exist, we'd have to make up a fictional character like this.</p>
</details>

他的脸是快乐的旗帜。

<details>

<p class="english-text">His face is a flag for Joy. You know,</p>
</details>

对于那些一直追随他职业生涯的粉丝，以及可能正在阅读这本书并发现他作为加拿大偶像的魅力的新粉丝，您希望他们从他的职业生涯中获得什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for fans who have followed him throughout his career and new fans who might be opening this book and discovering uh you know what a what a mogul he was really for for Canadians here. Uh what do you hope uh they take away from his career?</p>
</details>

他真的努力去拍那些能让人发笑的电影，但他对人也很好。嗯，“他在无人关注时也很好”这句话经常被提及。我听很多人都这么说过。我认为，成功人士也能与人保持一对一的真诚交流，这其中蕴含着某种意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He really tried to do films that made people laugh, but he was also good to people. Um, he was good when no one was looking is a phrase that comes up a lot. I hear that in a lot of other people have said that. And I think there was something about you could be a big success and still stay scaled one-on-one with people.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这绝对是我们要学习的。而且，我想对于所有加拿大人来说，在一个非常具体的层面上，你知道，代表性很重要。我带着一点嘲讽说这句话，因为，是的，又是另一个白人男性，但是，它代表了加拿大人所追求的善良和价值观，即使这只是一种愿望。我们希望变得更好，我们这里有一个偶像。所以，这是一个很好的理由来庆祝他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean, that's definitely the lesson. And also, I guess for all Canadians on a very specific level, you know, representation matters. I say that with a little bit of facicisness because, yeah, another white guy, but but the representation of the goodness and the values of Canadians that we aspire to, even if it's only aspirational. We want to be better and we we have an icon here. So, that's a good that's a good reason to celebrate him.</p>
</details>

### 当代喜剧的挑战与加拿大身份认同

我想稍微改变一下话题，从一个更宏观的角度来看。喜剧似乎正处于一个关键时刻。从斯蒂芬·科尔伯特的深夜秀被取消，到吉米·坎摩尔因对查理·柯克的评论而被停职，再到喜剧演员在沙特阿拉伯的利雅得喜剧节表演。以您对约翰·坎迪的了解，他会对现在发生的一切有何看法？哦，我必须先声明，我绝不敢妄自替约翰·坎迪发言。嗯，即使在书中，我也谈到了他的一些挣扎，但我从未分析或评判过这些。你知道，无论他如何生活，我无法设身处地为他着想。但我可以告诉你，如果有人因为他的喜剧而受到伤害，他绝不会那样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to change gears a little bit. Um, talk take a little bigger picture. Uh, comedy seems to be having a moment right now. Uh, from the cancellation of the the late show with Stephen Cobear to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, um, about his comments about Charlie Kirk to comedians performing at the Riyad Comedy Festival uh, in Saudi Arabia. Um, knowing what you know about John Gandi, what would he have made about all of this that is happening right now? Oh, I I I have to preface anything by saying I there's no way I presume to speak for John Candy at this point. Um, I don't even in the book I talk about some of his struggles and I never even analyze or judge those. Like, you know, whatever, however he lived his life. I can't walk a mile in his shoes. And I can tell you that if somebody's getting a hurt as a result of his comedy, he wouldn't do it</p>
</details>

根据我所看到的轶事证据，我认为他绝不会做残酷的喜剧或欺凌弱小。我想吉米·坎摩尔会喜欢他。我想他也会喜欢吉米·坎摩尔。你知道，像塞斯·迈耶斯这样的喜剧演员，他们都在积极向上，并且充满启发性。我不能替他发言，但我有证据表明他会做一些积极的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">based on anecdotal what I've seen. I don't think he would ever do cruel comedy or punch down. I think Jimmy Kimmel would like him. I think he would like Jimmy Kimmel. like you know those people who are you know Seth Meyers all those comedians who are out there being positive and and just being enlightened I don't can't speak for him but I evidence evidence-based he would have done something positive</p>
</details>

您不能替他发言，但您可以替自己发言。所以我想问您，作为一个居住在美国的加拿大人，您如何理解现在正在发生的一切？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can't speak for him but you can speak for yourself so I'm going to ask you as a Canadian living in the states how do you make a sense of what is happening</p>
</details>

这很难。我再次入境时他们会播放这个吗？哈哈，这个回答说明了一切。嗯，我会这样说。我最近写了一篇名为《**加拿大加州人**》（Canadiafornian: Paul Myers创造的词，指既有加拿大身份认同又在加州生活的人）的文章，并在其中阐述了我现在的观点。我爱我在北加利福尼亚与妻子共同生活的空间。我们都是加拿大人，但我们都获得了美国护照，因为我们想参与那里的公民政治。那是在奥巴马执政时期。所以，别生我的气。嗯，我们预订了“波塞冬号”的船票，在它翻船之前。所以，我会告诉你，我无论走到哪里都觉得自己是加拿大人。所以，我是一个加拿大加州人，因为当我看到加利福尼亚共和国的旗帜时，我也感到一丝自豪。每当看到州长对抗总统时，我都会觉得我们的州正在坚持，你知道，有点坚持。所以，如果情况有变，我会告诉你的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's tough and uh are they going to show this when I enter the the country again uh [laughter] no And that answer says it all. Um I would say this. Um I recently wrote an essay u called the Canadiafornian and in it I formulated this view I have now. I love my space in Northern California that I live in with my wife. We're both Canadians but we both got US passports because we wanted to engage in civic politics there. It was during the Obama years. So so so [laughter] don't get mad at me anyway. Uh, and um, so we booked tickets on the SS Poseidon before it flipped and uh, and so I will tell you that um, I always feel Canadian everywhere I go. Uh, I so I am a Canadian fornian because I also feel a little bit when I see the Republic of California flag, I feel a little bit of pride and whenever I see the governor pushing back against the president, I feel uh, you know, our state is uh, is holding out, you know, a little bit. So, if that changes, I'll let you know. Okay.</p>
</details>

但是，我绝对觉得自己是加拿大人。我感到非常自豪。我刚刚在卡尔加里参加了一个作家节，我在小组讨论中谈到了“加拿大状况”，这是我们永远乐此不疲的话题，也许也永远不应该停止谈论。我希望加拿大能拥有我喜欢的所有酷炫之处。它是我的家。所以，我不是因为现在在多伦多才这么说，而是在任何地方我都会这么说。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But, but I definitely feel Canadian. I feel super proud. I was just at a writer festival in Calgary, and I was on panels talking about the Canadian condition, which is something we never tire of talking about, and perhaps never should. I I want to I want Canada to be all the cool things I like about Canada. And it is home. So, and I'm not just saying that because I'm here in Toronto, but you know, I say that when I'm anywhere.</p>
