### 欢迎来到Odd Lots播客

主持人Joe Weisenthal和Tracy Alloway欢迎大家收听或收看Odd Lots播客的特别节目，该节目在**Lazard Forsquare Conference**（拉扎德四方会议: 一场关于媒体和交易的行业会议）上现场录制。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lord's Podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway. Today you are going to be, listening or watching a special episode of our podcast, recorded live at a conference which you've probably never seen before.</p>
</details>

他们采访了**Perplexity**（AI搜索引擎）的首席商务官Dmitry Shevelenko，Perplexity是一款领先的**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）模型，许多人可能已经使用过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this was at, the Lazard Forsquare Conference, and we interviewed Dmitry Shevelenko He is the chief business officer of Perplexity, which is something you might have used before. We certainly use it. Yep. One of the leading AI models.</p>
</details>

这次会议与媒体和交易有关，因此他们讨论了AI将如何影响品牌、新闻以及我们所知的互联网。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a conference related to media and dealmaking. And so we talked about what is going to be the impact of AI on brands, on the news and on the internet as we know it.</p>
</details>

他们还回答了观众通过应用程序提出的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, take a listen. We also took questions from the audience. So you will hear us referring to questions that we are receiving on the app. We hope you enjoy. Take a listen. Sorry about the music people either love or hate the music.</p>
</details>

主持人提醒观众，本次录音正在进行中，希望大家保持安静，但可以鼓掌、欢呼或尖叫，只是不要随意移动家具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so just a reminder, this is being recorded, so if you could keep it moderately quiet, you know, you can laugh, you can clap, do all of that, scream if you need to. Just don't rearrange the furniture and things like that.</p>
</details>

他们还再次提醒，整个讨论过程中都在通过应用程序收集观众提问，如果看到他们在看手机，那是因为他们在查看问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also reminder we're taking questions from the audience throughout this discussion. So if you send them on the app, we will see them and be able to ask Demetry and if we're looking at our phones, that's our excuse. Yeah. We're engaged in the question. We're engaged in the interview.</p>
</details>

### 人类提问的重要性与新闻业的未来

主持人Joe Weisenthal向Dmitry Shevelenko提出了第一个问题：“我们甚至需要和你对话吗？我的意思是，我可以直接在Perplexity上问所有这些问题，它会给我一个相当不错的答案。那么，对话的意义何在？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So here's my first question. Should we even be talking to you? What I mean by that is I could just go on Perplexity and ask all these questions, and then we'll give me a pretty decent answer. What's the point?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko感谢Joe的提问，并表示人类独特且卓越的能力在于提出问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, thank you for having me. It's great to be here. The, the the I love that that tee up and you guys are scheming backstage of, like, what's going to be the heart opening question, but I love it because the thing that humans will always be uniquely exceptional at is asking questions.</p>
</details>

他解释说，Perplexity可能拥有答案，但它没有与生俱来的好奇心，而这正是人类所拥有的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So perplexity may have the answer, but perplexity does not have an innate desire to be curious. And that's what you guys have.</p>
</details>

因此，新闻业和进行这些对话至关重要，因为重点在于问题，而非仅仅是答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why journalism is so important, and that's why having these conversations is important. It's about the questions, not necessarily the answers.</p>
</details>

### 网站的存废与Perplexity的信任机制

主持人Joe Weisenthal提出了一个相关的问题：既然我们处于一个可以直接从聊天机器人或类似工具获得答案的时代，传统的网站是否还有必要存在？出版商为何还要继续投入设计和各种资源，而用户可以直接从Perplexity或**ChatGPT**（OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）等工具获得答案？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kind of related to this, I guess. But here's the thing that I always think about, which is I'm, I enjoy using perplexity, etc.. Let's say, you know, you have great relationships with all the news publishers, etc. and the really cool thing, all and all those deals get solved, etc. like, why do we need the internet as we know it has web things called websites built for humans. Now that we're in this age where we can go to a, chat bot or something like it, and the answer is right there, do we need to have what are traditionally called websites anymore? Why would a publisher continue to invest in design and all of these things? When I could just get the answer from, perplexity or ChatGPT or whatever else?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko再次强调，我们之所以被媒体吸引，是因为记者和编辑提出的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, it goes back to I think the reason we're drawn to media properties is because of the questions that journalists and editors are asking. Right? It's it's not necessarily it's the framing. It is the what is actually worth asking about. What's worth reading about.</p>
</details>

他指出，Perplexity本身并没有这些问题的答案，用户必须带着问题来到Perplexity。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Perplexity doesn't have answers to that. Okay. You have to come to perplexity already armed with a question.</p>
</details>

人们通常阅读新闻，如果遇到不完全理解的地方，就会转向Perplexity寻求更深入的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And oftentimes people, you know, read news and there's something they didn't understand fully and they come to a perplexity to get that deeper understanding.</p>
</details>

然而，产生这种“火花”的是编辑判断力，是世界级记者的直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the spark, that comes from editorial judgment, that comes from the intuition of a world class reporter.</p>
</details>

因此，他们很高兴通过像**Comment Plus**（Perplexity推出的一项订阅服务，旨在与出版商分享收益）这样的项目，为新闻业寻找新的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why we're excited through, you know, programs like comment plus, to, to find new business models for that.</p>
</details>

主持人Tracy Alloway提问，Perplexity如何判断新闻来源的编辑判断或质量，因为未来很多新闻消费可能通过Perplexity模型进行，这意味着Perplexity将成为信息可靠性的仲裁者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you actually judge editorial judgment or quality of news sources? Because I can imagine a future where a lot of our news consumption is through something like a perplexity model, which means that you're basically the arbiter of what information is reliable. So how do you make those decisions?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko回应说，这并非由他个人决定，而是Perplexity技术的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it's not me at the, at the wheel. You know, ultimately this is where we focus, a big part of our technology. It's building accurate AI.</p>
</details>

他认为，未来最稀缺的不是智能，而是信任，而信任的基石是透明度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The thing that we believe is that's going to be most scarce in the future is not intelligence. It's trust. I think the bedrock of trust is transparency.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么Perplexity率先展示信息来源，并赋予用户自行判断来源好坏的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's why perplexity pioneered, showing you exactly which source the information is coming from and empowering users to apply their own judgment of whether that is a good source or not so good source.</p>
</details>

他们还部署了多种算法策略，例如，如果许多出版物都在报道同一件事，这通常是一个强烈的信号，表明其具有可信度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we deploy many different algorithmic strategies. Oftentimes if many, publications are saying the same thing, you know, that's a strong signal that they're on to something.</p>
</details>

对于异常信息，他们会更加敏感。他强调，这不是一个简单的问题，因此他们投入了大量资金并聘请了世界上最优秀的工程师来构建准确的AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And, you know, the outliers, you're kind of more, sensitive to, but this isn't, you know, it's not a simple problem. And this is why, you know, we raise a lot of capital and hire the world's best technologists to build accurate AI.</p>
</details>

### AI时代的竞争格局与用户对齐

主持人Joe Weisenthal提到，出版商对Perplexity作为信息目的地感到焦虑是可以理解的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think anyone could sort of intuitively understand why publishers might be anxious about perplexity as being a destination.</p>
</details>

他指出，就在三分钟前，彭博社爆出新闻，亚马逊要求Perplexity停止其AI代理进行购买行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Evidently, it's not just news publishers. Literally. When since we got on the stage in a three minutes ago, news broke that Amazon demands perplexity to stop AI from stop AI agent from making purchases. It literally just broke three minutes ago from Bloomberg.</p>
</details>

这表明不仅仅是新闻业，所有类型的企业都对Perplexity成为信息目的地感到焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the. It's not just news that's anxious about the idea of perplexity being the destination. Clearly it's, all kinds of businesses.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示他尚未阅读该文章，但对问题有所了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think, and I haven't read the article yet, but I'm going to read it out. All right. I think I have an understanding of the issues. Yeah.</p>
</details>

他解释说，与亚马逊的问题与Perplexity的网页浏览器**Comet**（Perplexity的网页浏览器）有关，Comet内置了AI助手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The, ultimately the issue with, with Amazon is tied to perplexities web browser called comment. And comment is a web browser that has an AI assistant built into it.</p>
</details>

他们认为，重要的是消费者和终端用户在访问出版物、网站和互联网时，能够使用强大的AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And what we think is important is that consumer and end users have access to powerful AI when they are accessing, publications, accessing websites, accessing the internet.</p>
</details>

互联网的前30年，AI是失衡的，**Google**、**Netflix**、**Facebook**等大型科技公司利用AI来控制我们看到的内容，引导我们点击某些东西而非其他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first 30 years of the internet, we had lopsided AI where big tech, you know, Google, Netflix, Facebook, they used AI to control what we see, to get us to click on certain things and not click on other things.</p>
</details>

现在正在发生的变化是，Perplexity致力于将强大的AI赋予终端用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is changing now is perplexity is focusing on giving powerful AI to the end user.</p>
</details>

他们认为这是正确的做法，这是一个有原则的观点：当用户在亚马逊购物时，亚马逊无权干涉用户是否使用AI来评估“这是否是最好的购买选择？”、“我能否在其他地方找到更便宜的？”或者“我是否真的需要购买他们推荐的其他商品？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we think this is the right thing to do. We think it's a principled viewpoint that when you're on Amazon, it's not Amazon's business. Whether you're using AI to help you evaluate, is this the best thing to buy? You know, can I find it cheaper somewhere else? Do I actually need to buy the other thing they're telling me to buy with it?</p>
</details>

世界上最富有的人有私人购物助理来帮助他们完成这些，而Perplexity正在将这种智能和助理服务民主化，普及给所有人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The world's wealthiest people, they have personal shoppers that help them do this. And we're democratizing that sort of intelligence, that sort of assistant access to everyone.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问，Perplexity的竞争论点是否是**Google**或**Amazon**等公司可以创建类似产品，但它们的商业模式基本上阻止了它们这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just in terms of competition is the argument, basically, that technically, you know, a Google or an Amazon could create similar products to what you guys are doing, but their own business model basically prohibits them from doing what you're doing.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，这正是他们向投资者推介的观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I should have you join our next investor pitch is exactly that.</p>
</details>

他认为，对于一个与用户利益一致的独立、中立的AI参与者来说，存在巨大的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">It is, there is a big opening for an independent, neutral AI player that is aligned with users.</p>
</details>

**Google**每季度仍能产生1000亿美元的收入，其中大部分来自广告商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, Google is still, you know, they're generating, you know, 100 billion, in revenue per quarter, which is amazing. But a lot of that is coming from getting, you know, adver. Yeah, their customers, advertisers,</p>
</details>

**Amazon**则试图让用户购买尽可能多的商品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, Amazon, they're trying to get you to buy as many things as possible.</p>
</details>

而Perplexity的成功指标是用户是否愿意支付订阅费用，因此他们完全与用户利益一致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our success metric is the users. Are they willing to pay for a perplexity subscription? And so we're purely aligned with our users.</p>
</details>

### Perplexity的商业模式与差异化

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问Perplexity与**OpenAI**等竞争对手的差异化优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When speaking of competition, like what is the differentiator? Okay, maybe Amazon has some obvious, angles and some of the others. OpenAI seems sort of independent in the same bucket. It's really huge. It's one of the biggest websites in the in the world. It doesn't strike me. Many of the, things that they offer replicate seem sort of similar to perplexity. You must get this. I don't know, you know, private stock. Answer this. But what is the differentiator between you and, and, and OpenAI?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，他很幸运能与许多好奇心强、每天需要回答难题的人交流，他们都告诉他自己在用Perplexity。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, I, I'm fortunate to get to speak with a lot of curious people that have to answer a lot of hard questions every day. And they're they tell me they use perplexity.</p>
</details>

他指出，Perplexity的核心是专注于准确性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it comes back to we're focused on accuracy above all else.</p>
</details>

**ChatGPT**是一款出色的产品，但它的优化目标是用户参与度，它试图成为用户的啦啦队长和教练，鼓励用户继续使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ChatGPT is an amazing product. But they built a product that is optimized for engagement. It's trying to be your cheerleader, your coach. It's trying to get you to to keep going.</p>
</details>

此外，ChatGPT的设计并非为了使用最好的技术来回答问题，而是为了使用他们自己的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they've also built a product that is designed not to use the best, in service of your question, but it's designed to use their lives,</p>
</details>

而Perplexity作为中立、独立、值得信赖和准确的平台，其一部分宗旨是使用最好的技术来以最佳方式回答问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so part of being neutral, part of being independent, trustworthy, accurate is using the best possible technology to answer the question in the best possible way.</p>
</details>

因此，Perplexity聚合所有最好的模型，拥有自己的独立搜索基础设施，而不是像ChatGPT那样使用**Bing**搜索API，这些都是构建更实用、更准确AI的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so being an aggregator of all the best models, having our own independent search infrastructure, that isn't the Bing search API, which is what, ChatGPT uses, those are all the building blocks of a more useful, accurate AI.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问Perplexity目前的收入来源，因为他们主要依靠订阅，并曾尝试过广告，但似乎已暂停。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's your actual revenue source at this point? Because I know you're big on subscriptions. You experimented with ads. I think you might have paused that at this point, but it does seem if you're trying to be different to Google, you probably don't want to be as ad driven as they are.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，他们在消费者订阅和企业版Perplexity（供员工使用）方面都取得了巨大进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So we're seeing tremendous traction with both consumer subscriptions and then companies buying the enterprise version of perplexity for their employees.</p>
</details>

他指出，在企业环境中，拥有准确、有用的知识具有极高的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately, it's in that enterprise context where having accurate, useful knowledge is incredibly valuable.</p>
</details>

他们拥有一个仅有五人的企业市场团队，该业务今年增长了八倍以上，消费者订阅也增加了数倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, we've had, you know, we've been fortunate with a enterprise go to market team of just five people. You know, seen that business, you know, more more than eight acts this year, seeing, you know, many multiples increase in our consumer subscriptions.</p>
</details>

他们致力于构建与用户利益一致的产品，同时为品牌和广告商创造营销价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're excited about building products, that are user aligned, that also create marketing value for brands and advertisers.</p>
</details>

但这不会是重建**AdWords**（Google的在线广告平台）和基于点击的系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this isn't going to be rebuilding AdWords and click based systems.</p>
</details>

他们认为重要的是创造真正的价值，例如当用户的个人AI代理（由Perplexity驱动）评估潜在的商业机会时，可能会提供独家折扣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We think it's important to create real value so that when your personal AI agent, powered by perplexity, is evaluating a potential commercial opportunity, it's something you might buy. Imagine, you know, alongside the answer, you got an offer for an exclusive discount that would be something that your agent would say, hey, this is even though this someone's paying for this to show up here. This is actually a good deal.</p>
</details>

如果只是一个不断提示“点击我”的广告，他们认为这不可持续，也不是他们希望构建的营销产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If it's just an ad that says click me, click me, click me, we don't think that's going to be sustainable. And that's not the type of marketing products we're looking to build.</p>
</details>

### AI融资环境与SPV的考量

主持人Tracy Alloway询问了AI领域的融资环境，指出现在的融资轮次似乎正在模糊，不再是明确的种子轮、A轮、B轮等，而更像是一个持续的资金流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we talk a little bit about the fundraising environment for I mean, obviously we know how crazy, you know, intense things are, are people throwing cash at you as you walk down the street? But also, it feels like every day, like, I like it used to be when I paid attention to startups, it felt like there were discrete rounds. There was a seed and then an A, and then a B and maybe a C and then an IPO. When I read, it feels like every day there is just it or the are the rounds blending into each other. So that is just the sort of ongoing stream of oh, here's a do raise, etc.. We got some new chips and then we are giving them some equity and so has the has the line between rounds. Is it blurring. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，在加入Perplexity之前，他大部分职业生涯都在消费互联网公司度过，也曾创立一家机器人初创公司，现在的融资环境与那时非常不同，那时充满挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So before perplexity I mean, I spent most of my career at consumer internet companies, but a stint as, a founder of a robotics startup and, I is definitely a different fundraising environment than that was, which was, very challenging.</p>
</details>

他认为，核心在于许多投资者相信（Perplexity也同意）AI领域正在发生的事情，其深远程度堪比互联网的最初引入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think at its core, a lot of investors believe in and we agree with this belief that, what's happening with AI now is as profound as the original introduction of the internet.</p>
</details>

因此，现在正在诞生一批新的世代公司，其中很多价值在这些公司仍是私有企业时就已经在复合增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there are going to be a wave of new generational companies that are being built right now. And, you know, a lot of the value is actually, you know, compounding while these companies are privately held, and so that that is yeah, there's a lot of conviction, by, by private investors in that,</p>
</details>

其次，投资者本身就是Perplexity等产品的重度用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think a second piece is that investors themselves are power users of products like perplexity.</p>
</details>

他们有许多问题需要解答，进行大量研究，因此他们不仅对资产负债表有抽象的理解，还有自己的直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are people that have a lot of questions, do a lot of research. And so they have not just an abstract understanding of a balance sheet. They have their own intuition,</p>
</details>

这与**B2B SAS**（Business-to-Business Software as a Service: 面向企业的软件即服务）非常不同，后者需要进行30次客户访谈才能获得二手信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, which is very different than like B2B, SAS, where it's like, you know, you have to go do 30 customer interviews and you're kind of getting all the second order information,</p>
</details>

而Perplexity，投资者可以亲自使用，理解其价值、节省的时间和创造性的扩展，这给了投资者信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, perplexity, use it yourself. You understand the value, the time that you just saved, the creative expansion you just had. And and that gives investors conviction.</p>
</details>

这种信心正在推动当前的融资环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that that is, you know, fueling this environment,</p>
</details>

他承认有时市场可能过于泡沫化，肯定会有投资者做出错误的押注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is that at times, you know, too frothy? Sure. You know, are there going to be some investors that, that make the wrong bets? Absolutely.</p>
</details>

但人类对“好问题的好答案”的核心需求是无限的，因此他们对未来的道路充满信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the core human need of getting good answers to good questions, you know, we think that is boundless. And so we're, we're confident in the path ahead.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问Perplexity是否会拒绝某些投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, speaking of froth, is there anyone you turn away in terms of being an investor?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，在泡沫时期，会出现一种多层**SPV**（Special Purpose Vehicle: 特殊目的载体，一种用于特定交易的法律实体）现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So there's this phenomenon, that that tends to happen in bubbly periods of, multilayered SVS. So SPV are special purpose vehicles.</p>
</details>

这意味着存在多层外包融资，其中募资者并非通过投资本身赚钱，而是通过管理费赚钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you basically have many layers of outsource fundraising where you have, you know, principal agent misalignment, where the fundraiser is not making money off the investment, they're just making money off the management fee.</p>
</details>

他们经常会收到来自这类参与者的接洽，一旦发现是这种情况，就会避免接受这些资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we often get approach, from players in that space. And we, you know, whenever we can detect that's what it is. We, we avoid taking on funds like that</p>
</details>

因为他们希望投资者能够直接接触Perplexity，并着眼于长期发展，而不是仅仅为了赚取管理费的快钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because we want investors, who are getting direct access to perplexity and who are in it for the long haul, who aren't just trying to make a quick buck on on a management fee flip.</p>

### Chrome竞标与私有公司股权控制

主持人Tracy Alloway对私有资产的代币化以及离散融资轮次的问题很感兴趣，并询问私有公司和上市公司之间的界限是否会不可避免地消失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk about this more. I'm really fascinated. We actually we did an episode, with a vlog ten of the Robinhood CEO, and he was talking about tokenization of private assets. And I guess this sort of actually relates to the question about discreet rounds, but does it feel like, you know, in theory, if some sort of slice of equity in, perplexity, maybe people sell forwards or these vehicles that are linked to it, does it feel like the line between what it means to be a private and a public company is inevitably going to disappear, especially adding the fact that we seem to be on this road where public companies will not be expected or required to have to report information, as timely as they used to.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko认为，作为一家私有公司，控制股权的出售非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's important, when you're a privately held company to control the sale of your equity.</p>
</details>

他指出，他们曾收到许多代币化方案的接洽，但挑战在于，如果**Cap Table**（Capitalization Table: 资本结构表，记录公司股权所有者及其持股比例的文件）上的股东不着眼于长期，他们可能会寻求快速套现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the challenge, you know, why I we haven't. Yeah. We've been approached by a lot of these tokenization schemes. And, you know, again, if you have folks on your cap table that are not aligned for the long term. Yeah, they may be looking for quick flips.</p>
</details>

这会在市场中产生奇怪的信号，并可能损害主要的融资活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then that creates a weird signal in the market. And that may harm, you know, a primary race. Right.</p>
</details>

他认为，这种流动性带来的噪音是不必要的风险，因为他们并不缺乏其他投资渠道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the the noise that comes with that liquid, it's not like we're short on other, you know, investment, you know, avenues, so it's just an unnecessary kind of noise risk.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal提到了Perplexity曾出价350亿美元收购**Chrome**（Google开发的网络浏览器）一事，询问这是否只是一个“恶作剧”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, speaking of throwing money around the $35 billion bid for Chrome was. What was that? Was that a troll?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko解释说，他们提出竞标时，**DOJ**（Department of Justice: 美国司法部）尚未决定Chrome是否会从**Google**剥离。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We that was when we made that bid. The DOJ had still not decided, whether Chrome would be divested, from Google, the web browser,</p>
</details>

他指出，正如亚马逊的行为所证明的，浏览器显然是一个极具价值的“表面区域”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as evidenced by, you know, Amazon's, behavior is clearly incredibly valuable surface area,</p>
</details>

350亿美元只是起拍价，他现在可以肯定地说，Chrome的价值远不止于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that, you know, 35 billion was the starting bid. You know, like, at this point, I can safely say I think Chrome is worth more than that.</p>
</details>

他可以自信地说，有超过350亿美元的投资者对这项竞标感兴趣，因此资金方面不是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what I can, confidently say is we had more than 35 billion of investor interest in making that bid. So it was not a, constraint on, you know, the funding side.</p>
</details>

显然，除非被迫，否则**Google**不会出售Chrome，目前看来政府也不会强迫他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, Google does not want to sell Chrome unless they will be forced to, and it doesn't look like the government will be forcing them.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal追问，这是否是认真的，而不仅仅是反垄断的姿态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're serious about that one? It's not just a sort of antitrust flag waving exercise. No.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko证实，他们有非常大的主权财富基金已经准备好参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had, you know, very large sovereign wealth funds that, you know, we're we're kind of lined up and ready to go.</p>

### Perplexity的单位利润与支出结构

一位匿名观众通过应用程序提出了一个关于单位利润的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's a great question from, someone anonymous via the app. Can you talk about unit margins? I you often hear this and it's like, oh, these AI companies, they're not even on a unit basis making money given the compute costs, etc., are what can you talk about gross margins. And right now, whether like, you know, a given query is profitable given the cost of delivering,</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，对于Perplexity而言，付费的**Perplexity Pro**订阅用户是盈利的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the, a paying pro subscriber to perplexity is profitable for us. Okay.</p>
</details>

因此，单位利润是强劲的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the unit margins are strong.</p>
</details>

目前免费用户因为没有变现，所以会亏损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The, you know, free users right now because we do not monetize them. Sure. You know, we don't, you know, we lose money on those,</p>
</details>

他指出，AI公司在计算免费用户时，通常将其归因于研发，因为这些提示仍用于改进和训练系统模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI companies. I think something that is underappreciated, they generally actually, when they do that counting of free users, they attribute that to research and development, because you're still using those prompts to improve and train your system model.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问是否所有Pro用户都盈利，因为AI领域有时会出现重度用户导致亏损的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are all pro users profitable? Because this also strikes me as something unique with AI, which is that, you know, when back when Twitter was in its infancy, power users were good. It feels like in the case with AI, sometimes you get these power users where you're losing money on them. Are all pro users profitable, or do some use it so much that it's more than the subscription fee?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko回应说，这并非一个实质性问题，他们也推出了最高级的订阅层级。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I don't it's not a material amount, and we've also introduced a max tier.</p>
</details>

除了每月20美元的Pro订阅，对于需要最昂贵的推理模型和更高使用限制的用户，还有每月200美元的**Perplexity Max**产品，该产品还提供电子邮件助手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have a $20 a month Pro subscription. And for the folks that want, you know, the most expensive reasoning models and higher limits on them, there's a $200 a month product called Max. And then it also gets you access to our email assistant.</p>
</details>

他指出，其他公司也推出了更高级别的订阅层级，因此这不是AI独有的问题，通过引入服务层级可以支持规模化运营。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think you'll, you know, and other companies have also introduced kind of higher tiers of subscription. So this is not a problem that's unique necessarily to AI. And and you kind of introduce tiers of service to to support it at scale.</p>
</details>

主持人Tracy Alloway询问Perplexity目前的支出结构，最大的开销是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your expenditure actually look like at this point. Like what are you spending the most money on? Is it we read about these insane salaries for engineers going to cloud or OpenAI or whatever. Is it talent retention or is it compute power? Is it the content deals with media organization. What are you spending on?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，最大的开销是**inference**（推理: 指AI模型在训练完成后，利用已有知识对新数据进行预测或生成结果的过程），即计算成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the biggest expense is inference, right. So it is the cost of compute. When you're you're asking a question and running, it through a, oh, you know, that that is, that is a material expenditure.</p>
</details>

Perplexity不进行预训练，因此他们不需要像其他公司那样支付数亿美元给AI博士。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We, you know, perplexity doesn't do pre-training. So the sorts of AI PhDs that other companies are, you know, paying, you know, reported, hundreds of millions of for, we're not that that's not we're not in the market for that.</p>
</details>

他们招聘的是优秀的AI应用工程师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have incredible AI application engineers and that's that's what we recruit for.</p>
</details>

加入Perplexity的工程师是因为他们相信公司才刚刚开始，他们是为了股权增值而来，而这已经初见成效，但仍处于旅程的开端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately, engineers that are joining perplexity are joining because they believe we're just getting started. Right. And they're coming for an equity appreciation story. That's, you know, already bearing fruit. But we're just at the beginning of that journey.</p>
</details>

### AI发展的瓶颈与基础设施

主持人Joe Weisenthal提出了一个关于AI对话中常见瓶颈的问题：是人才、资本、计算能力还是电力？如果可以无限量地拥有其中任何一项，Dmitry Shevelenko会选择哪一项？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe this is sort of a way of restating Tracy's question, but it all doesn't feel like any, any AI conversation. It's like, what is the bottleneck, right? Yeah, right. Is it talent? Is it capital? Is it compute? Is it power, etc.? Like if you could have unlimited amounts of any one of those things, what would you want more of right now?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko认为需要区分：有公司进行基础模型的训练，这些公司确实需要大规模的基础设施建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's important to bifurcate. There is the companies that do the training of foundation models. And those are the ones that are really pushing for the massive infrastructure build out. Yeah.</p>
</details>

而Perplexity目前在**inference**（推理）方面没有计算能力的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're not constrained on compute for inference, at the current usage levels,</p>
</details>

但他指出，随着用户行为的转变，如果更多人停止主要使用**Google**来获取信息，那么对推理的计算需求会增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but as you know, behavior shift, I mean, by a show of hands in the room, like how many people have stopped primarily using Google when they have an informational question? So, you know, about what 80% of the room, you know, raise their hands and we see the early adopter behavior in you know, audiences like this, you know, folks that work in financial services, people that, again, for for whom quickly getting high quality information matters as you know, this behavior becomes more mainstream. We obviously will need more compute for inference.</p>
</details>

那些谈论数万亿美元投资的人，他们所处的领域与Perplexity不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the the folks that are kind of talking about trillions of dollars in investment, it's really a different universe than ours.</p>
</details>

他有时不清楚这些投资的必要性，感觉有时像是一种策略，类似于美国试图通过让竞争对手破产来赢得与苏联的竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I it's unclear to me why some of those investments are needed. Sometimes it feels like a strategy of, you know, kind of what what the US was trying to do with the Soviet Union of just getting your competitors to, go broke, by, you know, being able to raise the most capital. And we'll see how that plays out.</p>
</details>

### AI对金融服务业的影响

主持人Joe Weisenthal提到了金融服务业，并引用了观众的问题，询问AI将如何影响**Lazard**等华尔街公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since you mentioned financial services, we have a good question from the audience. We've done some media navel gazing. I'm sure we're going to do some more, but for now, financial services, navel gazing. What do you think the impact of AI will be on places like Lazard and other Wall Street firms?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko认为这将带来创造力和生产力的巨大提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just think this is going to be a incredible flowering of creativity and productivity lift.</p>
</details>

他认为，投资银行家日常使用Perplexity和其他AI工具的影响是双重的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think of using a product like perplexity and other AI tools in the day to day of somebody that works on an investment bank is really twofold.</p>
</details>

首先，它可以节省80%的时间来完成工作产品的80%初稿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is saving you 80% of the time, to get to that 80% first draft of a work product. Right.</p>
</details>

在投资银行中，这意味着在制作演示文稿、建模等方面获得巨大的效率提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And investment banks, that's kind of putting together pitch decks. Doing modeling, just gaining tremendous efficiency.</p>
</details>

他强调，这并非要使工作流程自动化，人类的判断在最终输出和方法上仍然绝对必要，AI不是为了取代投资银行家，而是为了赋予他们巨大的杠杆作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not it's important to distinguish it's not about making that workflow autonomous. You still absolutely need human judgment on, you know, what the end output should be, how to approach it. This is this is not about replacing investment bankers. It's about giving them tremendous leverage.</p>
</details>

其次，更具颠覆性的影响是，现在启动新项目、开发新客户变得更容易了，这将带来更多新的业务机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the more disruptive impact is now that it got a lot easier to begin a new initiative, to begin a new prospect, how many more new engagements are you going to be able to spin up? Right.</p>
</details>

因为新业务的最大限制是员工是否有能力承担，而经验丰富的领导者现在拥有了更大的杠杆作用，这将对**Lazard**产生深远影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the biggest constraint on new business is an employee feeling they have the bandwidth to take it on. And and, you know, experience leaders now have much more leverage. And I think that's going to play a profound role at Lazard. And you know, part of why I'm excited to be part of the organization,</p>
</details>

### 媒体品牌与AI时代的适应

主持人Joe Weisenthal表示他喜欢观众提问，因为这些问题提醒了他一些他本想说但又觉得不礼貌的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love these audience questions because they're, saying things that I would think that reminded me and that I would have been rude to say.</p>
</details>

他指出Dmitry Shevelenko没有回答第一个问题：新闻业将如何生存？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You didn't answer the first question about, are you going to kill journalism? But someone says you didn't answer the first question, how would journalism survive?</p>
</details>

观众的问题是，既然我可以去一个不需要点击其他地方就能获得信息的目的地，为什么品牌还要继续为人类阅读和滚动而构建内容呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I had skin that I get, oh yeah, you know, I isn't interested in asking questions, but that's not the question is like, why would brands continue to, like, build out these presents for like a human reading and scrolling when I can just go to one destination that doesn't necessarily click me anywhere else?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko回应说，看看《**The Wall Street Journal**》、《**The New York Times**》和**Bloomberg**等媒体公司的财报，它们似乎表现良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, when I look at the earnings numbers for the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, for Bloomberg media companies seem to be doing fine. New York Times is doing well. So games and I don't know if you get earnings numbers for. But what I, what I hear. Yeah like some subscription numbers.</p>
</details>

他认为，这类似于互联网刚引入时的情景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But by the way yeah I was doing a lot more than games. I actually didn't know there. It's a very impressive company. But by and large I it does not look like the actual news business. It's a lifestyle company is doing particularly well. But I think it's it's part of the value of the bundle. I mean, it's, I mean, this is a very this is very analogous to when the internet was first introduced.</p>
</details>

当时，最好的实体零售商适应了数字环境，现在最好的出版商也在适应并利用AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had traditional brick and mortar retailers and the best brick and mortar retailers adapted to the digital environment. And the best publishers are adapting and gaining leverage. With</p>

他提到前一晚**Axel Springer**的CEO谈到如何拥抱AI，并将其视为提高生产力的绝佳机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, last night we had, the CEO, of Axel Springer, talk about how he's leaning into AI, and it's actually an incredible opportunity for productivity.</p>
</details>

因此，他认为这不是零和游戏，有些出版商会蓬勃发展，有些则不会，媒体行业本身已经面临挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I, I don't think this is zero sum. I do think there's going to be some publishers that thrive and others, and the media business is already facing challenges, you know, certain segments of it. Well, before I, so I don't see this as being kind of the fundamental tension.</p>
</details>

### Perplexity的互联网愿景与Comet Plus

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问，如果展望未来5到10年，互联网的首页会是什么样子，以及媒体与Perplexity这类平台之间的经济协议会是怎样的理想形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you fast forward 5 or 10 years from now, what is the front page of the internet actually will look like to you? And what exactly is I? I guess the economic pact between media and platforms such as yourself. What would the ideal pact or agreement actually look like? Like how? Basically, give me your vision of the internet in five years,</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，他们正在推出**Comet Plus**，目前已与《**The Washington Post**》、**Condé Nast**、《**LA Times**》等许多优秀出版商签约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we, we're introducing something called Comet Plus, which, we already have the Washington Post and Condé Nast, LA times, many great publishers signed on for.</p>
</details>

这个项目的灵感来自**Apple News Plus**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was really inspired by Apple News Plus,</p>
</details>

如果用户订阅每月5美元的Comet Plus（已捆绑在**Perplexity Pro**中），当他们在Comet浏览器中消费优质内容时，Perplexity会按比例将收入分享给出版商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where if you are a Comet Plus subscriber, which is $5 a month, and we bundled into perplexity Pro so even people that didn't necessarily, you know, want to pay for it. We're taking money out of our, cut and feeding it into this program to see it. As you consume premium content in the comet browser, we're then sharing that revenue back proportionately with publishers,</p>
</details>

这不仅考虑了优质内容的页面浏览量，还考虑了AI代理在该内容上的操作以及在Comet浏览器中的引用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's actually accounting for not just page views of premium content, but agent actions on that content and citations in the comet browser.</p>
</details>

他认为订阅是媒体非常强大的商业模式，还有很多工作要做，Perplexity希望在这方面发挥主导作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so ultimately, I think subscriptions are a very powerful business model for media. I think there's a lot more to do there. And we want to play a leading role in doing that.</p>

### Perplexity与Bloomberg Terminal的定位

主持人Joe Weisenthal对Perplexity内的金融模块印象深刻，并指出许多公司都曾试图挑战**Bloomberg**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm very impressed by the, the finance, module within perplexity. You know, there's a whole graveyard of companies that have tried to take down our, our employer and, at Bloomberg.</p>

他询问Perplexity是否认为自己是**Bloomberg Terminal**（彭博终端: 彭博社提供给金融专业人士的计算机系统，用于访问实时市场数据、新闻和分析）的潜在挑战者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you see yourself as a potential challenger company? Tracy asked about, you know, financial services, etc.. Do you see yourself at some point down the road as a challenger to the terminal? Yeah.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that like it's this is like we know it's very lucrative is hiring a company.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you're thinking about the lazards of the world and all the other banks, could you at some point see yourself pitching perplexity or perplexity terminal as a where all these other ones had failed to do it?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，对他们来说，更大的图景和机会不是去挑战Bloomberg Terminal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for us, the bigger picture, the bigger opportunity is not to go after Bloomberg Terminal.</p>
</details>

而是为所有无法负担Bloomberg Terminal的人提供一个对他们有用的版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's giving everyone who can't afford Bloomberg Terminal a version of it that is useful for them.</p>

<p class="english-text">And when they're making retail stock investment decisions, when they're understanding the interplay of the markets and the news cycle, that they have access to powerful technology. Right.</p>

### AI时代的关键技能：提问与好奇心

观众**Olivier**提出了一个问题：媒体娱乐高管在管理AI对内容产业的影响方面，关键技能会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another question from the audience. This one's from Olivier. Olivia on, what do you think will be the key skill sets for media entertainment executives to manage the impact of AI on content industries?</p>

Dmitry Shevelenko认为，对于AI时代的任何专业人士来说，关键技能都是要非常擅长提出正确的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think, my answer to this is the answer. I think it's a key skill set for any professional in the age of AI is you have to get really good at asking the right questions.</p>
</details>

这意味着要问团队他们在做什么、杠杆作用是什么、独特的差异化在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that means asking your teams, why are they working on what they're working on, what's the leverage? What's the unique differentiation.</p>

要以深刻的好奇心来对待业务，并理解存在新的颠覆和杠杆机会，并以这种好奇心引领。

<p class="english-text">Everyone always says that. But what does a good prompt actually look like to you? Can you give us a specific example of like a prompt that really impressed you?</p>

<p class="english-text">I think to me, asking you a good question is like a level deeper than like the prompt engineering is, is kind of that that in some ways will get abstracted very soon.</p>
</details>

他所说的提出好问题，是指一个问题能够体现并嵌入关于某个特定主题的所有已知知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I say asking good question, it means a question that embodies and embeds all the known knowledge on a given topic.</p>
</details>

然后，你提出的问题就是“你将如何推动前沿？”“什么是尚未可知但你在问题中推动组织去探索的？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the question you're asking is then, you know, where do you push the frontier? Like what is what is the the thing that is not yet knowable, that in your question you're pushing your organization on,</p>
</details>

### 浏览器作为战略要地

主持人Joe Weisenthal回到浏览器的问题，提到了Perplexity对**Chrome**的竞标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, going back to, the browser question about the bid for Chrome, Google itself earlier this year,</p>
</details>

他指出，今年早些时候很多人认为**Google**会被AI颠覆，这是一个经典的**Innovator's Dilemma**（创新者的困境: 指成功企业在面对颠覆性创新时，往往难以适应并最终被淘汰的现象）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there are a lot of people like, oh, Google is going to get disrupted by AI. And it's a classic innovator's dilemma. They invented all this tech and they're not making.</p>
</details>

但现在股市认为**Google**（或其母公司**Alphabet**）表现出色，很多人改变了看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the stock market views Google's done phenomenally or alphabet. They've done phenomenally well. And a lot of people have really changed their tune on them.</p>
</details>

如果浏览器是如此重要的“房地产”，那是否意味着**Google**拥有巨大的优势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the browser is such an important part of the real estate here, does that just give them a massive leg up? I mean, I know you're going to have your own and OpenAI is going to have its own, but Chrome is everywhere. Like how that sounds like a very big Mo.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko承认这是一个非常强大的分销杠杆点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a very powerful distribution leverage point.</p>
</details>

但他指出，**Google**最大的优势也是其弱点，因为他们围绕**AdWords**系统构建，依赖于人们点击链接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But their greatest strength is is also a weakness in that they built it around a AdWords system where they're reliant on people clicking on links.</p>
</details>

未来互联网中，点击推广链接的行为将不如过去重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the behavior of clicking on promoted links will just matter less in the future of the internet than it has in the past.</p>
</details>

### AI时代的“SEO”与信任

主持人Joe Weisenthal询问，一些公司在**LinkedIn**上宣传的“AI版**SEO**（Search Engine Optimization: 搜索引擎优化）”是否都是虚假宣传，或者是否存在出版商或品牌可以利用的AI游戏规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of promoted links is another question I've been wondering about. Sometimes I see these companies and they advertise on LinkedIn, and they offer what I think is sort of would be the equivalent of like the AI equivalent of SEO. Is that all snake oil is there, like whatever is, does that exist? Can are there these games that publishers or any brands can play to do well in AI, or is that sort of a fraud?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示他不想称之为欺诈，他尚未发现这些公司提供的数据分析是可操作的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to call it a fraud. I have not, uncovered, those companies provide analytics, but they're not actionable. Okay.</p>
</details>

他没有找到任何可操作的输出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I have not found an actionable output there.</p>
</details>

在某种程度上，Perplexity的目的是阻止这些“洞察”变得可操作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in some ways, our purpose is to prevent those insights from being actionable.</p>
</details>

因为如果可以操纵Perplexity的答案，就意味着它不准确、不可信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if you can game a perplexity answer, it means is not accurate and trustworthy.</p>
</details>

因此，如果他们发现任何漏洞，Perplexity有更好的工程师来修补。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, if they do find a hack, like we have better engineers that will, fill that hack,</p>
</details>

### AI输出的随机性与记忆管理

主持人Joe Weisenthal提出了一个哲学问题：Perplexity的输出中能否注入一点随机性或创造性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have a slightly philosophical question, but is there any way to inject a tiny bit of randomness or creativity in some of, perplexity output?</p>
</details>

他以算法内容审核为例，如果用户在**Netflix**上只看浪漫喜剧，Netflix就会一直推荐这类电影。他询问Perplexity如何处理这种风险，即用户被限制在特定的答案流或互联网的某个角落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I mean by that is, I think at this point, we're all aware of, algorithmic content, moderation. And the idea that if you start your Netflix account and you watch one romantic comedy for the rest of your life, Netflix is going to be throwing like Matthew McConaughey films at you forever and ever and ever. How do you deal with that aspect of it? The risk that people are funneled into, like one particular answer stream or one quarter of the internet.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，“记忆”将是Perplexity等产品的一个重要功能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So memory will be an important feature of products like perplexity.</p>
</details>

他们避免这种陷阱的方式是透明度，就像对待信息来源一样，他们会向用户展示所有已添加到记忆中的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the way we avoid that trap is transparency, just like we do with sources, where we actually show you all of the things that we've added to your memory.</p>
</details>

如果用户不想被归类为浪漫喜剧爱好者，只需删除相关记忆即可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you don't want to be pigeonholed as a romantic comedy lover, you just delete that memory.</p>
</details>

他举例说，他最近开始服用保健品，现在每次询问保健品时，答案中都会提到他开始服用石榴补充剂的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean, I, I'm kind of, I recently got into health supplements, and now every time I ask about health supplements, my decision to begin, you know, pomegranate supplements is getting mentioned. The answer and, yeah.</p>
</details>

他删除了这条记忆，因为他不想答案总是回到石榴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I, Yeah, I deleted that because I'm like, you know what? I don't want to, like coming back to the pomegranates. As great as they are, and that was, you know, that that I just went and deleted that memory. I saw where it was. And, you know, I'm pomegranate free in my answers.</p>
</details>

### 快速变化的环境与核心原则

主持人Joe Weisenthal提到了一个关于互联网第一波浪潮的比较问题，指出内容创作、AI代理工作室和变化速度都非常快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a question here about, let's see the comparison to the first wave of the internet. So this person is talking about content creation, AI agent Studios, pace of change, moving very fast. I mean, is decision. What's really extraordinary to me about the last several years is the speed with which we seem to get new paradigms right.</p>
</details>

他指出，博客在20年前曾是大事，但寿命只有几年，然后是社交媒体、**Twitter**等。他询问在如此不确定的条件下，Perplexity如何做出投资决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blogs were one or going to be a big deal. That was 20 years ago. They had a life span of a few years then, you know, social media, Twitter, etc. there's been how do you think about, things get, overturned so fast these days? How do you think about making investment decisions under such conditions of uncertainty?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，他们喜欢**Jeff Bezos**的那句话：“难以预测的不是什么会改变，而是什么会保持不变。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. This is, I mean, a funny time to to drop his name, but this is where we love the Jeff Bezos line of, you know, it's the hard thing to predict is not what's going to change, but what's going to remain the same.</p>
</details>

从他们的角度来看，基石是准确性和信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think from our vantage point, the bedrock is accuracy and trust. Right.</p>
</details>

随着智能变得更强大，它操纵我们的能力也更强，因此信任的基石至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's actually as intelligence gets much more powerful. It's gets more powerful manipulating us. And so that's why kind of that trust bedrock, is paramount.</p>
</details>

他说，他有一个管理信条：他坚信六个月后，他会有一个今天尚不知道的前三大优先事项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That said, one of my, you know, management, mantras is that I have absolute conviction that six months from now, I'm going to have a top three priority, that today I don't know what it is.</p>
</details>

这其中蕴含着一种理解，即即使是模型开发者，在发布新模型之前，也不知道其新兴能力和有用应用会是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that embedded in that is an understanding that even the model makers themselves, when they release a new model until it's out, they don't know what emergent capabilities and what the useful applications of that will be. Yeah.</p>
</details>

因此，拥有核心基础原则，同时保持敏捷性和适应性，并善于应用新的能力来服务用户，这将是一个关键的运营技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so kind of, you know, having core foundational principles while at the same time preserving agility and adaptability and being the best at applying the new gifts we get, for the service of users that that's going to be a key operating skill.</p>
</details>

### AI是否处于泡沫之中？

主持人Tracy Alloway提出了观众问题的第二部分，也是大家普遍关心的一个尖锐问题：“AI是否处于泡沫之中？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a second part of that audience question that Joe just asked. And I think it's it's probably the one that's on all of our minds, and it's the bluntest one. But is is I in a bubble?</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko认为，肯定有一些部分不是泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are certainly parts of it that that are not you obviously your competitors, presumably. Right.</p>
</details>

他想到专业人士和知识工作者所获得的效率和杠杆作用，他看到了由此产生的数万亿美元的经济生产力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think of all of the time and leverage that professionals and knowledge workers are getting and I, I to me the ROI on that like I can see the trillions of dollars and economic productivity happening from it.</p>
</details>

但他承认，有些公司确实筹集了过多的资本，这将导致生态系统中的不平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But are there certain companies that have just raised too much capital and is going to create, imbalances in the ecosystem? Yes. All right.</p>
</details>

### AI技术的快速迭代与开放心态

主持人Joe Weisenthal指出，很多AI产品仍然不好用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we only have 45 seconds. My issue is a lot of things still don't work.</p>
</details>

他举例说，他昨天尝试问**ChatGPT**纽约市公立学校有多少个完整的教学周，**ChatGPT**却说它需要手动计算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I, I tried to ask. ChatGPT. Yesterday how many full school weeks there are in New York City public schools? And it's like, oh, I'd have to count it by hand and do it. Seriously said that it puts a screenshot of it.</p>
</details>

许多AI代理在执行过程中会中途崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of these agent things, like they don't work very well. Like much like a lot of things I want to ask, who are the most common guests on our blogs over the years? It just gave me a bunch. This was like, this is not your site, but I'm just saying, like a lot of AI agents and so forth, they sort of crap out halfway through.</p>
</details>

Dmitry Shevelenko表示，他很想现场演示其他产品可以给出好答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'm tempted to do a live check of other products that will give you a good answer on that. But, the,</p>
</details>

他指出，这又回到了新兴能力的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This goes back to what I was saying about emergent capabilities,</p>
</details>

失败案例（在许多企业对话中也出现）是，仅仅因为两个月前尝试过某项功能，并不意味着它现在仍然不起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the fail case, and this comes up actually in many enterprise conversations, is just because you tried something two months ago. Yeah. It doesn't mean it didn't work. It doesn't mean it's not working today.</p>
</details>

因此，我们都需要保持开放的心态，这些技术正在以惊人的速度变得更智能、更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we all need to keep this open mind that these technologies are getting smarter and better, at a rapid clip.</p>
</details>

这些问题都是可以解决的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And, you know, those are solvable problems.</p>
</details>
