### 澳大利亚犹太节日枪击案：反犹暴力与社会警钟

昨天，澳大利亚悉尼邦迪海滩发生了一起针对犹太社区的致命袭击。在庆祝光明节首晚的拥挤人群中，一名50岁的父亲和他24岁的儿子开枪射击，造成至少15人死亡、数十人受伤。当局称这是一起“纯粹的邪恶行为”和“反犹主义恐怖袭击”。一名旁观者被官方称为“真正的英雄”，他从背后扑倒其中一名枪手并夺下长枪，迫使袭击者逃离。警方在现场击毙了父亲，而儿子则面临刑事指控。澳大利亚自上世纪90年代大规模枪支回收后，此类大规模枪击事件极为罕见——当时政府熔毁了约百万支枪，并严格限制半自动步枪的拥有。然而，此次袭击者却持有合法的休闲狩猎许可证，暴露出监管漏洞。

<p class="english-text">What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores. In Sydney, Australia, authorities say they've concluded that a father and son were responsible for a massacre this weekend at a Jewish holiday celebration. At least 15 people were killed and dozens more were rushed to hospitals after the two men opened fire yesterday at Bondi Beach, a popular tourist spot that was packed with people celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. We could just hear the gunshots and they were just so loud and we didn't know which way that they were shooting. So, we were like running on the open road. At one point, a bystander, who officials called a genuine hero, snuck up and tackled one of the shooters from behind. The man wrestled a long gun from the attacker, who then retreated. Police say they shot and killed one of the men at the scene, the 50-year-old father. Authorities expect to bring criminal charges against the son, who's 24, but they haven't released their names or provided details about the men's exact ideology. Mass shootings like this are extremely rare in Australia, which put in place strict gun laws after a deadly attack in the '90s. The government melted down as many as a million guns, according to some estimates, and essentially banned many types of rifles. Police say one of the suspects in yesterday's shooting was a member of a gun club who had a recreational hunting license that allowed him to have a weapon.</p>

此次袭击发生在澳大利亚犹太社区已因以色列与加沙战争而高度紧张的背景下。自10月7日以来，针对犹太场所的纵火袭击频发，包括以色列餐厅、托儿所和犹太教堂。

<p class="english-text">The shooting comes at a time when many Jewish Australians were already on edge. Since the October 7th attacks in Israel in the ensuing war in Gaza, Jewish groups say there's been a wave of anti-semitic violence in Australia, including arson attacks that have targeted an Israeli restaurant, a daycare center, and a synagogue.</p>

### 罗布·雷纳之死：一位文化偶像与政治倡导者的离世

洛杉矶警方正在调查好莱坞著名演员兼导演罗布·雷纳与其妻子米歇尔在布伦特伍德家中被发现死亡的“明显凶杀案”。雷纳享年78岁，是电视喜剧先驱、《迪克·范戴克秀》创作者之子。他早年热爱戏剧，后成为热门情景喜剧演员，并执导了《公主新娘》《这是斯巴达克斯》和《当哈利遇到莎莉》等广受喜爱的电影。他不仅在娱乐业成就斐然，更是一位积极的政治活动家——曾大力推动同性婚姻合法化，并在90年代主导了一项提高烟草税以资助早期儿童发展计划的公投。前总统奥巴马在声明中悼念他，称雷纳“不仅在好莱坞取得成功，更怀有对人性良善的深刻信念，并毕生致力于将这种信念付诸行动”。

<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, in Providence, Rhode Island, officials say they're still searching for a gunman who opened fire on campus at Brown University, killing at least two students and injuring nine others. Obviously, we have um murderer out there, frankly. But the fact of the matter is is that a law enforcement has the tools necessary to solve this case. The attack happened shortly after 400 p.m. on Saturday when a masked man burst into a lecture hall where dozens of students were studying for a final econom. An eyewitness told the Times the gunman started shouting something, then opened fire as students scrambled for cover behind seats in the auditorium. On Sunday morning, officials said they detained a person of interest, though by late last night, they announced they hadn't found enough evidence to charge that person with any crime. Authorities say they're searching for more video footage that could lead them to a suspect. Brown University says it's canceled classes and exams for the rest of the semester. In Los Angeles, police say they're investigating an apparent homicide after the Hollywood actor and director Rob Reiner was found dead yesterday along with his wife Michelle. Officers found the bodies at the Riner's home in Brentwood, a wealthy LA neighborhood. As of last night, police said they were trying to get a search warrant for the home and had not identified a suspect. Reiner was 78. He was the son of a pioneering TV comedian who created The Dick Van Dyke Show. In high school, he was drawn to theater and later became a popular sitcom actor before going on to direct a slate of beloved films. Inconceivable. You keep using the word. I do not think it means what you think it means. He worked across a range of genres. There was the childhood classic The Princess Bride, the mockumentary This is Spinal Tap, as well as romantic comedies. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. Like when Harry met Sally in the courtroom drama, A Few Good Men. YOU WANT ANSWERS. I WANT THE TRUTH. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. Reiner also led a prominent political life. He was a champion of liberal causes like gay marriage. And in the '90s, he spearheaded a ballot initiative to boost taxes on tobacco to pay for early childhood development programs. In a statement, former President Barack Obama mourned the deaths, saying that even beyond his success in Hollywood, Reiner had a quote, "Deep belief in the goodness of people and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action."</p>

### 特朗普政府启动航空旅客信息共享：移民执法的系统性升级

《纽约时报》获悉，特朗普政府已启动一项前所未有的安排：运输安全管理局（TSA）每周多次向移民与海关执法局（ICE）提供所有美国境内航空旅客的名单，以便执法人员逮捕有驱逐令在身的人。尽管乘客信息历来会与恐怖分子监控名单比对，但这是TSA首次直接参与国内移民或刑事执法事务。此举是白宫推动联邦机构间合作、以实现“美国历史上最大规模驱逐行动”目标的一部分。此前，国税局（IRS）同意向ICE提供移民地址信息，但已被联邦法院阻止。目前尚不清楚因该计划已导致多少逮捕行动。人权第一组织的负责人批评此举是“试图恐吓和惩罚社区，将使人们害怕离开家门”。国土安全部发言人则表示：“对非法滞留者的信息很明确：你唯一应该乘坐飞机的理由，就是自我遣返。”

<p class="english-text">The Times has learned that in an unprecedented arrangement, the Trump administration has been providing the names of all air travelers in the US to immigration officials under the program, which was started in March, but hadn't been previously reported. The Transportation Security Administration is providing a list multiple times a week to ICE officials. The list tells them who will be coming through airports so that agents can arrest anyone with a deportation order. Airline passengers have long been subject to federal scrutiny. For example, passenger information is typically compared against terrorist watch lists. But one former TSA official said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in domestic immigration or criminal matters. It comes as the White House has been trying to boost cooperation between federal agencies to carry out President Trump's goal of the largest deportation campaign in US history. Earlier this year, the IRS agreed to hand over the addresses of migrants to ICE, though that move was blocked in federal court. For the moment, it's not clear how many arrests have been made as a result of the TSA's work with ICE. Immigration activists have criticized the cooperation with a director at the group Human Rights First, telling the Times, "It's an attempt to terrorize and punish communities and will make people terrified to ever leave their homes." A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said, quote, "The message to those in the country illegally is clear. The only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home."</p>

### 加拿大抢购美国烈酒：贸易冲突下的消费反扑

目前，加拿大正爆发一场大规模的“抢购美国烈酒”热潮。今年早些时候，特朗普总统宣布对加拿大征收高额新关税，并威胁将其变为第51个州，导致多个加拿大省份抗议性地将美国酒类从货架上撤下。今年第二季度，加拿大进口的美国烈酒暴跌85%。如今，一些省份决定临时恢复销售，以清理库存，部分收益将捐赠给慈善机构。这一短暂的购买窗口期已导致曼尼托巴省政府经营的酒类商店每日排起长队，杰克丹尼威士忌和赤足葡萄酒尤为畅销。温尼伯一家酒吧老板告诉《纽约时报》：“虽然过去我们曾因支持本土消费而充满爱国热情，但我正焦急地等待我的肯塔基波本威士忌和田纳西威士忌到货。”他说：“我迫不及待想为顾客提供一杯真正的老式鸡尾酒。”

<p class="english-text">And finally, there's a major shopping spree going on right now in Canada, where people are stocking up on American liquor while they can. Earlier this year, when President Trump announced stiff new tariffs on Canada and threatened to make it the 51st state, many Canadian provinces protested by pulling US spirits from their shelves. In the second quarter of this year, Canadian imports of American liquor plunged by 85% according to the head of an industry group. Now, a number of provinces have decided to temporarily restart sales to get rid of their remaining stock. Some of the proceeds will be donated to charity. The brief buying window has led to daily lines at government-run liquor stores in Manitoba, according to the head of the province. He said Jack Daniels seemed to be particularly popular along with barefoot wine. The owner of a pub and restaurant in Winnipeg said that while there had been what he called a lot of patriotism around the movement to buy Canadian, he's eager to get his order of Kentucky bourbon and Tennessee whiskey that's on the way. He told the Times, quote, "I'm anxiously looking forward to being able to serve a proper old-fashioned."</p>
