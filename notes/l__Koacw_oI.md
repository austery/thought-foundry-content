title: 加州“亿万富翁税”争议：深度解析科技、政治与社会热点
---

### 加州“亿万富翁税”提案：一场政治作秀还是财政良方？

加州的财富税到底是怎么回事？**SEIU**（Service Employees International Union: 服务业雇员国际工会，一个影响力巨大的劳工组织）提出了一项直接面向选民的投票倡议，旨在修订加州宪法，征收一次性的“亿万富翁财富税”。根据该提案，任何净资产（扣除债务后）超过十亿美元的个人，都必须一次性缴纳其净资产5%的税款，这包括了他们的非上市公司股票和房地产。

这项税收针对的是净资产，而非收入，是一次性支付给加州政府的。虽然提案中规定了资金的分配方式，但其本质是一次性的亿万富翁税。然而，这种修宪提案很可能违宪，即使选民投票通过，也可能无法真正执行。无论是在联邦还是州层面，都存在一个“统一性”原则，即税收必须平等地适用于每个人。唯一的例外是**消费税**（Excise Tax: 针对特定商品、服务或交易行为征收的税），例如对收入或交易征税，可以根据收入或交易规模的大小进行不成比例的征税。但如果要对财产或资产征税，就必须统一对待所有人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What's the story with the California wealth tax? Can somebody explain this to me? Okay. So, the SEIU, the Service Employees Union, filed a ballot initiative, which means a direct-to-voter vote to amend the California Constitution to introduce a one-time billionaire's wealth tax where billionaires, anyone who has assets over a billion dollars net of their debt, has to pay a one-time tax of 5% of their net worth, including their private stock, including their real estate. 5% of their net worth, not of their income, of their net worth, the entire net worth, onetime payment to the state of California, and then there's an allocation on how that money will be spent, but it's a onetime billionaire tax. Now, it is very likely that this sort of an amendment to the California Constitution is not constitutional and actually cannot be made and will not actually go into enforcement even if the voters do vote to approve it in both a federal and a state level based on this concept of uniformity which is that you have to tax everyone equally except for the case of an excise tax which is like income or a transaction. You're allowed to tax disproportionately based on the size of the income or the size of the transaction. But if you're going to tax on property, if you're going to tax on an asset, you have to tax everyone uniformally.</p>
</details>

因此，即使该法案通过，也很可能不会生效。然而，SEIU 很可能只是以此为诱饵，引诱人们站出来公开谴责，然后他们就可以借机攻击这些人，将其作为下一个选举周期的政治素材。这似乎才是他们当前的真实动机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is likely not going to go into effect if it does pass. However, it is very likely the case that the SEIU is simply using this as a baiting mechanism to get people to stand up and denounce it and then they will be in a position to attack those people and destroy them and use this effectively as a political fodder for this next election cycle. That's what it seems like the true kind of motivation right now.</p>
</details>

目前，有人正试图说服加州民主党高层官员表态，指出这项提案的荒谬之处，认为这会导致人才和资本离开本州。但坦白说，为什么加州的大多数公民不会投票支持这项提案呢？谁不想对亿万富翁征收5%的税呢？提案的措辞非常巧妙：“我们有300亿美元的财政缺口，而加州有200人控制着两万亿美元的财富。我们只是要求他们一次性支付5%的费用。”在投票站，很难想象有谁会觉得这听起来不合理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we don't know who's going to come out against it, but there's an effort to try and get top Democrat officials in the state of California to say, "This is silly. If you do this, people will leave the state." yada yada. So, that's kind of a quiet underway effort. But I don't know why the citizens of California, the majority of citizens of California would not vote for this. Why? Who wouldn't want to tax the billionaires 5%. Come on. Like, the way that it's written, it says, "Hey guys, we're 30 billion in the hole and there are 200 Californians that control two trillion dollars. We're just going to ask them to pay a onetime fee of 5%." And I don't see how anybody would say that doesn't sound unreasonable at the ballot box.</p>
</details>

而那些站出来大声反对并指出历史教训的人——比如法国当年推行类似政策时，因富人纷纷携资离境而导致税收收入锐减40%——他们的声音很可能会被淹没。现实情况是，这项提案为通过立法铺平了道路。因为如果它体现了民意，即便之后被推翻，聪明的立法者也会顺势在州参议院推动通过一个符合法律的、渐进式的税收体系。毕竟，民意已经很明确了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the people that step up against it and are vocal against it and point out like hey in France when they did this they lost like 40% of their revenue because all the wealth left the country. The reality is that this sets it up to go through the legislature because if it goes through the will of the people and it gets overturned as you say Freeberg then if you're legislatively smart then you'll actually push it through the state senate. And then it will not get vetoed like because then it's like hey listen it's clear that the people want this. So I think that you'll have some kind of progressive taxation system that conforms to the law.</p>
</details>

他们已经在试图延长**Prop 55**（第55号提案: 一项针对年收入超过一百万美元人群的累进税法案），并且很可能会成功。但这只是针对收入的增量税。而一次性的财富税则不同。针对百万富翁的税收可能更难推行，因为它触及的人群太多。在2025年，一百万美元的价值已今非昔比。但十亿美元的门槛确实将绝大多数人排除在外，只剩下几百人。这样一来，对出售增值股票征收10%的消费税就显得非常合理了。有很多方法可以征收到数十亿的税款。所以，这更像是一个试探气球，看看能否在200名加州人和其余加州人之间划出一条清晰的界线。一旦这条界线变得清晰可见且被社会接受，他们就会变本加厉，尽可能多地征税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean they're already trying to extend Prop 55, which is the progressive tax for people making over a million dollars. They're going to get that passed. That's going to be this incremental tax on income. But the onetime wealth, I think the million dollars thing, I think that's harder to hunt because there's too many people that that touches. A million dollars today in 2025, not to be glib, is just not what it used to be. But a billion dollars does cut off most people except for a couple of hundred. That is true. And I think that for example, it's very reasonable to then charge a 10% excise tax on selling appreciated stock, right? Why not? There's all kinds of ways that you can get billions and billions and billions of dollars. So, I don't know. I think that this is more of a trial balloon to say, can we draw a clear line between 200 Californians and the rest of California? Yeah. And to the extent that that bright line becomes visible and it's okay, people are going to go ham. They're going to try to get as much as they can.</p>
</details>

现实是，正如我们所知，拉里·埃里森已经离开了加州，许多在加州创建了大型科技公司的创始人和CEO，比如埃隆·马斯克，也离开了。他们最终会在某个时刻选择离开，带走公司、员工以及所有商业经济价值。但人们永远不会吸取教训，因为对政客来说，站在选民面前说“我们是否应该向这200人征税来为你们提供更好的福利？”要容易得多。97%的人会说“当然”。很少有人会坐下来思考这背后将要发生的连锁后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reality is, as we all know, I mean, Larry Ellison left the state. Many of the founders CEOs who have built large technology companies in California. Elon left the state will eventually at some point break and say, "Okay, I'm moving my company out of state and I'm leaving the state and I'm bringing the employees with me and I'm bringing all of the economic value of this business with me." And people will never learn that lesson because it's so much easier to sit in front of a voter and say, "Hey, should we tax these 200 people to give you better benefits?" 97% of people will say, "Absolutely." Very few people will sit and think about the consequences of what's going to end up happening.</p>
</details>

这项法案的一个动机，也是为什么它由SEIU提出，是因为加州公共和私人养老基金的福利支出急剧膨胀，给州政府和一些私人养老金计划带来了巨大的、显而易见的负债。他们正试图填补这个养老金的窟窿。这个国家存在着一个数万亿美元、未被计入账目的养老金负债，这笔钱总得有个来源。要么联邦政府介入，通过印钞来填补所有这些养老金义务的缺口；要么各州会推行这种大规模的累进税收计划来尝试填补。而一旦他们这么做，正如我们所知，将会出现一个非常糟糕的经济周期：所有价值都会离开该司法管辖区，转移到别处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the motivations for this bill, and this is why it's being proposed by the SEIU, is that there are these massively ballooning pension benefits and pretty significant increases to the pension programs for both private and public pension funds in California, which has actually become a very visible liability for the state and for some of these private pension programs. and they're trying to fill the pension hole, which we've talked about in the past, but there is a multi-trillion dollar unaccounted for pension liability in this country that's going to have to come from somewhere. You're either going to have to print the money because the federal government's going to step in and fill the hole in all these pension obligations or they're going to have these massively progressive tax programs to try and fill the hole. And if and when they do, as we all know, there will be an economic cycle that will be pretty nasty, which is all the value will leave that jurisdiction and move elsewhere. But let's see.</p>
</details>

起草这份提案的人非常聪明。有两点值得注意：首先，任何超过1000万美元的**Roth IRA**（Roth IRA: 罗斯个人退休账户，一种具有税收优惠的退休储蓄账户）都被计算在内，而通常在财富计算中，递延退休账户是不包括在内的。其次，如果你做过任何有价值的税务结构安排，比如在怀俄明州和北达科他州设立信托并通过关联方贷款进行杠杆操作以转移资产，这些债务义务在计算净资产时将不被承认。这意味着所有这些税务规划都将失效。你可能会陷入一个非常困难的境地，被告知欠下数亿美元的税款，而唯一的支付方式就是给加州政府打一张欠条。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The crazy thing with this, the other like I read it because I was like, "Oh my god, what's going on?" The two things that they they obviously got somebody very clever to draft it because any Roth IRA over 10 million counts. And normally in these wealth calculations, you you keep your deferred retirement accounts off the table. They're typically not included. So folks, and I'm not going to say who they are. we all know who have tremendously appreciated Roth IRAs those are included and then the other thing is that if you actually did any tax structuring the real valuable tax structuring is where you set up these trusts in Wyoming and North Dakota and you do these interparty loans where you can lever up 10 20x so you can transfer billions and billions and billions of dollars out of state but then you have these obligations those are negated and they don't count so all that tax structuring goes out the So you can get into a very difficult situation here where they're like, "Hey, you owe us $500 million, a billion dollar, $2 billion, and the only way to pay it is to have an IOU to the state of California." Which is crazy.</p>
</details>

财富税在很多地方、很多时候都曾被尝试过，但结果总是事与愿违。因为国家获得的任何税收利益，都远远比不上因富人、就业创造者和公司离开而造成的经济萧条。一旦你跨过了从“无财富税”到“有财富税”的界线，足够多的富人就能看清形势，意识到他们必须离开。这就是为什么即使他们声称这只是“一次性”的，我们都知道这不会是最后一次。如果他们得逞，这将成为常态。这甚至不是为了填补紧急情况或一次性的无资金准备负债，而只是为了常规运营。因此，他们将没有任何动力去解决州政府的管理不善和财政赤字问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A wealth tax has been tried in many places at many times it always backfires because whatever the tax benefit is that you get for the state it's greatly outweighed by the economic depression that you get by the wealthy people the job creators companies leaving. And as soon as you cross that line of going from no wealth tax to any wealth tax, enough people of wealth can see the tea leaves, they can see the writing on the wall that they have to leave. And that's why I think even if they say this is a one-time thing, we all know that it won't be one time. If they get away with it, it'll become a regular thing. If it's to plug a deficit, they're going to run deficits every year. Exactly. And this isn't even to plug an emergency situation or an unfunded liability like some one-time thing. This is just a regular operating exactly. So they will have no incentive to fix their mismanagement of the state and their deficits and all that kind of stuff.</p>
</details>

而且，最终受影响的将不仅仅是亿万富翁。这条线最终当然会被下移。就像美国的所得税一样，最初可能只是针对富人征收1%的一次性税，然后逐渐扩展到低收入人群，最终每个人、每项财产都要纳税。这就是政府的问题所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not just going to be billionaires eventually the line will of course get pushed down be gone. The billionaires always like like the income tax in the US. I think it was a 1% income tax originally and it was like just a onetime thing for wealthy people and then it became a smaller thing for you know lower income people and then eventually as we all know every person has to pay a tax every property has tax and so on. I mean these are this is the problem with government.</p>

有些非常富有的人，比如杰弗里·卡森伯格或阿里·伊曼纽尔，他们是民主党机器背后的大佬，认为自己能够足够好地控制这台机器，让这只名为“社会主义”的老虎不会反过来吞噬他们。他们认为老虎在自己的掌控之中。但也许他们错了，也许这次就是老虎挣脱束缚的开始。去年，立法机构曾试图通过一项财富税法案，但在幕后被悄悄扼杀了，加文·纽森可能与此有关，因为他有总统野心，不能让加州彻底走向社会主义。但问题是，如果这些人失去了对这头“社会主义野兽”的控制，整个局面是否会失控？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what I wonder about is, you know, what are guys like Jeffrey Katzenberg or even Ari Emanuel thinking about right now because they're kind of the higherups in the Democratic party behind the machine, sort of the oligopoly that kind of runs the machine. I think there are these guys who are very, very wealthy who think that they can control the machine well enough that they basically are still in control of this thing, right? That in other words, that the tiger won't eat them, right? The tiger is socialism. You know, they think they've got the tiger under control enough that it won't eat them. But I don't think they do. Maybe they don't. Maybe this is the tiger breaking loose. And I think you pointed this out that there was an attempt in the legislature last year to pass a wealth tax and it was quietly killed behind the scenes. And I actually think that Gavin Newsome might have something to do with that because he has presidential ambitions. So he can't let the state go full socialist. But you just kind of wonder, okay, well, if these guys lose control of the strings they have to control the beast of socialism, does the whole thing just spin out of control?</p>

回顾法国的情况，在2011-2012年期间，他们确实赶走了演员热拉尔·德帕迪约，但当LVMH集团的伯纳德·阿尔诺——法国首富——威胁要移居比利时并“意外”提交了文件时，这发出了一个明确的信号。他最终撤回了申请，称之为文书错误，但这足以引起震动。

<p class="english-text">Just to let people know about the France situation back in I don't know 2011 2012 they did get rid of Gerard Depardieu which was kind of a win but Bernard Arnault said he was going to go to Belgium and said it was a clerical error and he unwound it but that was a clear signal the richest man in France. He's basically the entrepreneur LVMH together. I mean, it's their biggest company. It's the one that does all the luxury goods, all the craft goods that they're so famous for. I mean, yes, him threatening to leave France is, you know, accidentally filing paperwork. Oops. What an accident.</p>

看看纽约市，州税10.9%，市税3.876%，再加上2%的附加税，总税率高达16.8%，接近17%。如果你年收入1000万美元，这意味着要交170万美元的税。你可以买一架飞机，住在佛罗里达，一年来纽约150天。这种高税率正在考验人们的极限。

<p class="english-text">Here's your look at uh New York City. New York State tax 10.9% city 3.876% and the 2% tax put you at 16.8% for living in New York is 17%. I mean if you were making $10 million a year is it worth $1.7 million? You could get a plane. You could live in Florida. You could come to New York 150 days a year. There's really five good months in New York. the fall, the spring, and that's about it. You know, you go see the tree at Christmas, but it's cold. Well, that's not realistic for most people. And especially if you have kids and you care about them, you'd like them to be rooted somewhere. You're not going to shlep them around every month to arbitrage taxes. Yeah. Well, I mean, I do think they're they're going to test that at 17%.</p>
</details>

这里存在一个“搭便车”问题：没有人愿意站出来反对，所以这项提案很可能会通过。如果你是加州一家上市公司的亿万富翁CEO，站出来反对会让你失去一切。你的员工会反对，股东会攻击你，公关形象会一落千丈。所以，每个人都会保持沉默，然后悄悄地在奥斯汀或迈阿密的房产网站上看房子，讨论明年搬到哪里去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the free rider problem that we have is no one's going to want to stand up against it and the thing will just kind of pass. By the way, if you're a billionaire CEO of a public company in California, you have everything to lose to stand up and oppose it. Your employees will run. Your shareholders will attack you. You'll look awful in PR. So, everyone's going to sit quietly and start looking at houses on Zillow in Austin or Miami and be like, "Where should we move to next year, honey?" You know, like that's the conversation that's going on.</p>
</details>

更棘手的是，这项法案具有追溯效力。如果通过，它将追溯至2026年，这意味着你只有两三个月的时间来应对。即使它最终可能被裁定违宪，谁又愿意花上数年时间在法庭上等待结果呢？理性的做法是在1月1日之前就打包走人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Didn't you say it was retroactive? It's retroactive to 2026? So, if it passes, you have three months. Two months. Yeah. But again, I don't think it passes muster with the constitutional reads. Even if Friedberg is right that there's a good chance that it'll be found unconstitutional, how many years in the course is that going to take? And who's going to stick around waiting for that? In fact, the rational thing to do is pull up stakes before January 1st and leave right now.</p>
</details>

法案中还有一个巧妙的设计，即要求人们提交一份法律文件，证明自己的资产低于十亿美元。这使得如何为自己的投资组合（尤其是有大量非公开投资的情况下）进行市场估值变得非常困难。法案不允许任何流动性折扣，规定必须以合理的市场价格进行交易。例如，如果你拥有一支体育特许经营权的10%股份，即使你只花了5000万美元购买，但如果《福布斯》估值100亿美元，那么为了计算税款，你的这部分资产就被认定为价值10亿美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's a part of the bill that they could cleverly use which is called this ODA which is effectively this IOU mechanism and they could essentially say when these assets transact you owe us 5% on an excise basis and by the way there's an attestation that you have to file you have to file a legal document and this was quite well written in there which said you must attest that you have less than a billion dollars. Okay, now what? Okay, then I have to attest that it's more and then I have to know how do you even mark your whole portfolio to market if you have a lot of privates? They do not allow discounts. They do not allow liquidity discounts. It says if you are a reasonable buyer and a reasonable seller, you have to transact this at market price. So, for example, imagine you owned a sports franchise and the sports franchise, if you sell a minority share, you're typically selling it at a discount off the table. If Forbes says it's worth 10 billion and you own 10%, that's a billion dollars for the purposes of this calculation. I'm going to pay $50 million to keep it even if you paid 50 million to buy it.</p>

### NBA惊爆赌博丑闻：体育博彩合法化背后的乱象

今天早上，NBA爆出重大丑闻。FBI在一项体育博彩调查中逮捕了30人。现任开拓者队教练、名人堂成员昌西·比卢普斯因涉嫌与黑手党经营一个被操控的扑克游戏而被捕。迈阿密热火队的控球后卫特里·罗齐尔则涉嫌告诉朋友在他身上下注“小盘”，因为他打算以受伤为由提前退场。他的朋友们据称因此获利20万美元。

<p class="english-text">Big breaking news this morning. Huge scandal in the NBA. The FBI just arrested 30 people in a sports betting and gambling probe. This hardly seems real. Chauncey Billups, who is the current Blazers coach and was just introduced into the Hall of Fame, got pinched for a poker game he was running allegedly with the mafia that was rigged 17 different ways allegedly to Sunday. Terry Rozier allegedly is a point guard for the Miami Heat. He told his friends, this is crazy, you know, in the over-unders, you know, hey guys, bet the under on me uh in rebounds cuz I'm going to uh take myself out of the game with an injury allegedly. And uh his friends allegedly made 200 grand off this. Okay, just allegedly for the whole goddamn thing. Uh this is going across 11 states and a bunch of crime families.</p>

这起事件的规模之大，以及它引起了联邦调查局的关注，都令人震惊。这似乎不仅仅是普通的违规行为，背后可能有更大的问题。随着预测市场的兴起，以及数据科学和人工智能被用于发现异常行为，过去依靠内幕消息就能轻松赚钱的时代正在结束。当利润空间被压缩，各种市场力量碰撞在一起时，一场大规模的清理行动似乎正在进行中。

<p class="english-text">I think it's crazy. I think you're seeing a lot of these trends converge all at the same time. Meaning, you have the emergence of all of these prediction markets. you have a lot of data science and AI being used that shows that there's a lot of odd behaviors. So, it really was the squares versus the sharps. And if you had the inside edge, you were just printing money. Now that all of that is becoming more transparent, there's a lot less margin. Then what happens is you have these laws passed in the 11th hour. There was a an important gambling law that was inserted into the big beautiful bill that has implications to all of this. And now you're seeing the feds. The crazy thing to me is a press conference where Kash Patel is talking about this. I mean, that's like serious business when the FBI director is front and center talking about all this. So, I don't really know what it means to be honest. I was shocked at the scale of it and I was shocked that it's on the radar of the feds. This took I thought this is like pretty typical tickytacky stuff, but clearly there's something bigger. I don't know exactly what that bigger is, but something is happening where all these markets are smashing together. There's just a big cleanup effort going on.</p>

这些球员难道不明白，他们每年千万美元的NBA合同远比朋友们下注赢钱重要吗？他们难道不知道博彩公司会密切关注异常的投注行为吗？比如，为什么一个球员的篮板数大小盘投注额高达20万美元，而其他球员只有2万美元？

<p class="english-text">Are these people too dumb to understand that their $10 million contract to play in the NBA every year or $20 million contract is more important than your friends betting the under or over.

What are your thoughts here?</p>

总的来说，赌博应该被非刑事化。目前各州独立的监管体系造成了监管混乱，难以标准化、追踪和提供指导。我们更希望看到一个联邦层面的监管机构来统一管理。赌博不会消失，它是体育文化的一部分。像**Poly Market**（Poly Market: 一个去中心化的预测市场平台）这样的模式是最好的，因为它创造了一个市场，随着信息流入，市场会动态调整，每个人都能得到更公平的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think gambling generally as we call it should be decriminalized and I don't like this state-by-state setup with gambling. I think we should have a federal regulatory body to oversee, monitor, and the problem is you have state gambling commissions and we have a state-by-state kind of patchwork of regulatory authority that makes it very hard to standardize, track, and provide also guidance and feedback. I would much rather see this all kind of get handled at the federal level and and better organized. To Chamath's point, this is not going away. People love to bet on stuff. They love to gamble. This is part of sports. This is part of the culture. They're not going to just turn it off. The poly market model is the best model because it creates a market and so as information flows in that market will dynamically adjust and everyone will get a more fair price.</p>
</details>

对Poly Market交易的回归分析显示，它具有惊人的预测能力。数据显示，市场在事件发生前一周的准确率达到89%，而在最后四小时内跃升至95%。这意味着如果你跟随“聪明钱”的模式，你就能赚钱。Poly Market实际上比新闻媒体更早地掌握了新闻。当人们用真金白银下注时，市场就会找到真相。

<p class="english-text">Did you see the regression that they did on the poly market trades and how well they're in the money? Basically what it showed is like the front money is the sharps, the back money are the squares, but you have to fade the trade in the first week. So there's a very scientific method where if you want to make money on poly market, it became pretty clear. Jason, look at this. I sent Nick the tweet, but this is incredibly systematic. This is over many many many markets. But basically, 89% accurate one week out, but in the final four hours, it jumps to 95, which means that if you follow the sharps along this pattern, you're going to make money. Poly Market actually has the news before the news does. This is one of the most like powerful outputs of Poly Market is they're actually getting a read on what's going on in the world before the media recognizes it, before the public recognizes it. Because when you put money up, it actually turns out that when people have incentives, that market will find the truth.</p>

如果Poly Market成为跨所有预测和资产的真正流动性市场，那么我们现在看到的许多内幕交易和信息不对称问题将变得更加透明。体育博彩的问题在于它是一个单边投注，赌场设定赔率。如果你有内幕消息，你就可以利用套利机会。但在一个流动的、双边动态的市场中，你的内幕知识会迅速反映在资产价格和赔率中。因此，Poly Market实际上为当前充满内幕套利机会的赌博市场带来了真相和透明度，甚至可能解决一些根本性问题。

<p class="english-text">Now to the earlier question, if we end up there where poly market does become the truly liquid market across all of these kind of predictions all of these assets then a lot of what we are seeing with respect to insider trading insider information becomes much more apparent. So, the problem with the sports betting is that there's a one-sided bet. The casino sets the odds or, you know, whomever is setting the odds, and then you're either taking one side or the other. And so, if you have the insider information, you're taking the side that creates an arbitrage opportunity for you. But if you were to do that in a liquid market where there's someone taking the other side in a dynamic way, then the market very quickly moves because of the inside knowledge you have. And that inside knowledge is now reflected in the underlying asset price in the underlying odds that you get for that bet. And so Poly Market actually brings truth and transparency to what is currently an insider arbitrage opportunity and it may actually solve some of these fundamental problems in in gambling.</p>

### 亚马逊的“双重打击”：AWS大规模宕机与机器人取代计划

对亚马逊来说，这是艰难的一周。周一，**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊网络服务）发生大规模宕机，导致2000家公司和400万用户在半天多的时间里无法正常使用互联网。接着在周二，《纽约时报》披露的内部文件显示，亚马逊计划到2033年因使用机器人而不再招聘60万名计划中的员工。

<p class="english-text">Let's talk about this Amazon outage. Tough week for Amazon. They had this huge outage in the beginning of the week and then they had a bunch of leaked documents about their plans for uh jobs. And uh Monday, massive AWS outage, 2,000 companies, 4 million users unable to function on the internet for half a day, 15 hours, 20 hours. Uh and then on Tuesday, internal docs viewed by the New York Times showed Amazon plans to not hire uh 600,000 plan jobs uh because of robots by 2033.</p>

AWS的故事对云服务市场格局有重要影响。目前主要有三家云服务商：AWS、微软和**GCP**（Google Cloud Platform: 谷歌云平台）。AWS的年收入约为1240亿美元，略高于微软的1200亿美元，而谷歌云为540亿美元。但在增长率方面，AWS仅为17%，微软为26%，而谷歌云则加速增长至32%，甚至有说法接近40%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think the AWS story is interesting in terms of its implications for the clouds. There's effectively three major cloud vendors that compete with one another. AWS, Microsoft, and GCP or Google Cloud. And I'll just give you these numbers. AWS is $124 billion revenue run rate. Microsoft 120 billion. And Google Cloud 54 billion. But AWS, which is slightly larger than Microsoft, is only growing 17% year-over-year. Microsoft 26% year-over-year. And Google Cloud is accelerating at 32% year-over-year. And some say getting closer to 40% growth rate.</p>
</details>

从合作伙伴和企业客户那里听到的一个重要趋势是，随着规模扩大，他们都在转向多云模式，不希望依赖单一云服务商。AWS作为先行者，吸引了许多早期公司。但本周的宕机事件凸显了依赖单一云服务商的风险，这将加速企业向其他云服务商分散的趋势。这对微软、GCP甚至甲骨文来说都是一个有利的局面，他们的销售团队可以更有力地推广自己的服务，强调更高的可靠性。

<p class="english-text">The big thing I hear from partners and enterprise customers of these cloud services is that many of them if not all of them as they scale up move to a multicloud model. So none of them want to be dependent on a single cloud. Many folks started on AWS because AWS was the OG. Back in the day when I was running Climate Corp, I was the largest EC2 user on AWS for about a year and a half, which was their elastic compute cloud service. We were running all these models back then. So I knew that service very early on and it was very unique. It was very powerful and so a lot of companies that are old school established themselves on AWS very early on. But the outage that happened this week, I think starts to highlight for folks that they can't and shouldn't have a dependency on a single cloud service provider and will only accelerate the diversification of companies into the other clouds. And so I do think this is actually a very beneficial situation for Microsoft and GCP and to your point perhaps even Oracle in terms of giving those sales teams which are very aggressive a hard story to go and sell for and say guys you don't want to just sit on AWS in case this happens again we've got better infrastructure we're more reliable etc than these other guys so come and move over to us and that might be a little bit of a naive simplistic kind of reductive way to think about what happened this week but I we are seeing the smaller competitors accelerate and I think that this might be another kind of moment of acceleration for those folks.</p>

在非AI市场，所有云服务商提供的产品和服务大同小异，最终市场份额会趋向于三分天下。采取单一供应商策略是极其不明智的，因为这涉及到风险管理，甚至可能引发法律诉讼。但在AI市场，情况有所不同。目前，特定模型与特定硬件和云平台深度绑定。但最终，随着基础设施的完善，模型之间的依赖性会降低，应用层将能更灵活地调用不同模型。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think there are two markets there's the AI market then there's the non-AI market. In the nonAI market, everybody has everything. It all looks effectively the same. There's certain products and services that are unique to Azure versus GCP versus AWS, but by and large, the market is big enough and important enough that you'd have to be pretty insane to take a single vendor approach. And so what typically happens in these markets is that they start off really small. One person has all the share. And then as the market becomes very valuable and very big, everybody diversifies because it's a riskmanagement thing. And these things flow into the disclosures you have to make as a public company. And if you didn't have that diversification and something bad happened and it impacted your business, you could get sued. So there's all these reasons why eventually all these three big companies will converge effectively roughly a third, a third, a third. In nonAI, it's a third, a third, a third. It will it'll take circuitous paths, but that's where we'll end up. I think the way it works in AI is that you initially right now we're in this early phase where there's two paths. Path one is you need a specific model and it's relatively well integrated using a specific subsidized form of hardware on one of the hyperscalers but eventually you'll get more of that abstracted away as it gets pushed into the infrastructure so that you have less dependence on one model. There's a lot of work that has to get done and a lot of in-memory infrastructure that is not yet built that has to exist but once that exists it'll be easier for all of us at the application level to view these models a little bit more fungibly. And then at the bleeding edge you'll have the folks that basically give you some form of a hypervisor or virtual machine or the bare metal and that's where the neoscalers are doing really well but I think my point is that in any important market in compute in technology where there really isn't much of a differentiation I think you'll end up with these hyperscalers at a third a third a third now if one model is way way better and it's only on one of the clouds because Google writes a big check or Amazon writes a big check I could see that swaying the AI share but in the absence of that I think cheaper faster better is sort of the end destination for everybody.</p>

All those jobs are at risk. And we talked about this back in June when Andy Jassy telegraphed all this in a blog post where he said the next few years we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

埃隆·马斯克对此评论道：“人工智能和机器人将取代所有工作。工作将成为一种可选项，就像自己种菜而不是从商店购买一样。”参议员伯尼·桑德斯也表示，他担心马斯克可能是对的。当工人没有工作或收入时会发生什么？人工智能和机器人必须造福全人类，而不仅仅是亿万富翁。这些观点与日益高涨的社会主义思潮不谋而合。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Elon replied to my tweet and said, "AI and robotics replace all jobs. Working will be optional like growing your own vegetables instead of buying them from the store." And Senator Bernie Sanders came out and said, "I don't often agree with Elon Musk, but I fear that he may be right when he says AI and robotics will replace all jobs." So what happens to workers when they have no jobs or income? AI and robotics must benefit all humanity and not just billionaires. And I think this feeds into your story for the last two years on this podcast, Friedberg, which is the rise of socialism. These things and Bernie Sanders being the standard bearer for democratic socialism. These things are starting to come together.</p>
</details>

然而，将人工智能、自动化和技术进步视为社会主义影响的核心驱动力可能是一种误解。更深层次的原因在于，过去40年里，政府不断扩大，承诺为人民做更多的事情，但这在一个真正的市场体系中是不可能实现的。政府的过度干预导致了成本膨胀和市场扭曲。因此，机器人、富人或移民成为了替罪羊，掩盖了政府规模过大、效率低下这一真正导致社会主义螺旋式上升的根本原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that you are characterizing AI automation and technological progress as the core driver of the socialist influence and what I would argue is that the actual core driver of the socialist influence is the fact that we put in place a lot of people into government, passed a lot of laws that caused an increase in spending because we promised people that the government would do more for them over the last 40 years. That is not possible in a true market- based system. And so by telling everyone, hey, we're going to make sure you get better jobs. We're going to make sure you all get housing. We're going to make sure you get education. You cannot actually get a government to effectively do that because what ends up happening is the government inflates the cost of those things and the market doesn't actually work. So the truth is this is now like all other things a scapegoat for the true cause of the socialist movement which is that government has become too big, too unwieldy and its natural inefficiency has distorted markets to the point that there is maybe no point of return anymore. And people will not see that. They do not see it and they're going to look for reasons and they're going to look for scapegoats and they're gonna say, "Oh my god, look over there. There's a robot. That's the reason I'm losing my job. Oh my god, look over there. There's a rich person that works at a pharmaceutical company. That's the reason I can't get healthcare." Or an immigrant took my job, right? Is the one from the last 20 years. And so, fundamentally, I think that people aren't willing to and they're not going to see the true cause because there's no one that runs to go work as a politician that is going to raise their hand and say government is the problem. No one ever has gotten elected in a democracy doing that. So the natural course of things over 250 years is that people raise their hand and they say I'm going to give you more and I'm going to use the government to do it and then they go into the government. They make the government bigger and as a result of making the government bigger, the government is spending more. The dollar goes down. The performance of the services goes down and fundamentally we end up in a socialist spiral.</p>

### 特斯拉的未来：超越汽车，聚焦AI、能源与机器人

特斯拉公布了财报，营收创纪录达到280亿美元，同比增长12%，自由现金流巨大，现金储备高达400亿美元。不利的一面是，营业利润下降了40%。在财报电话会议上，埃隆·马斯克强调了他那万亿美元薪酬方案的重要性，并表示他对于在没有足够投票控制权的情况下建立一支庞大的机器人军队感到不安。

<p class="english-text">Tesla reported their earnings on Wednesday. Record revenues, 28 billion, up 12% year-over-year. massive amounts of free cash flow. Four billion I think they're up to 40 billion in cash uh which is always great when you're going into uh some big capital intensive projects like Optimus and like self-driving. Downside operating profit fell 40%. uh stock dropped a bit 4% but bounced back and uh on the earnings call Elon emphasized the importance of his trillion dollar pay package which will give him just but 12% uh additional stake over the next 10 years if he hits absurd targets that would make everybody who holds the share uh shares in the company extremely wealthy uh and they would benefit uh more than Elon himself and here's his quote my fundamental concern with how much voting control I have at Tesla is if I build this enormous robot army. Can I just be ousted in the future? I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least influence over it.</p>

他将**ISS**和**Glass Lewis**（Institutional Shareholder Services 和 Glass Lewis: 两家主要的代理投票顾问公司，为机构投资者提供投票建议）称为“企业恐怖分子”。这些公司代表被动指数基金就董事会成员、薪酬方案等事项进行投票。

</details>

关于特斯拉的未来，有三个关键点。首先是基础技术层。马斯克提到，他将多个项目合并，全力投入AI5芯片的设计。他表示，AI5芯片在某些指标上将比AI4好40倍，是他倾注了大量心血的“美丽芯片”。AI5将成为未来自动驾驶出租车（Cyber Cabs）和擎天柱机器人（Optimus）的基石。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is at the foundational technology layer. And Nick, I sent you this tweet, but it's what he said about AI5. I've made these comments before, but he had these multiple efforts with Dojo and other stuff that he merged into one unit. And the quote is pretty incredible. We're going to focus TSMC and Samsung on AI5. The chip design is an amazing design. I have spent almost every weekend the last few months with the chip design on AI5. By some metrics, it will be 40x better than AI4. We have a detailed understanding of the entire stack. With AI5, we deleted the legacy GPU. It basically is a GPU. We also deleted the image signal processor. This is a beautiful chip. I've poured so much life energy into this personally. It will be a real winner. Why is AI5 so important? What AI5 is is the building block of a system that I think you'll start to see not just in the cyber cabs but also in Optimus.</p>
</details>

其次是能源业务。这是支撑机器人和自动驾驶汽车的关键。如果机器人和自动驾驶汽车成功，旁边必须有一个运转良好的能源业务。特斯拉的能源业务正在飞速发展，每季度创造35亿美元收入，营业利润率高达30%。这将为从数据中心的大型电池系统到为机器人供电的小型LFP电池提供支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing was what he said about his energy business which I think is the critical adjunct to believe robotics and autonomous cars. If robotics and autonomous cars work, what you really need is an energy business beside it that is humming and on all cylinders. Why? It's how you make LFP battery cam that will be the limiter. Energy will be the limiter. But what he's showing, and Nick, I sent you this tweet, is that business is just on a tear. It's printing $ three and a half billion dollars a quarter, and its operating margins, an energy business, 30%. And so what you're going to see are battery packs of all shapes and sizes, the huge battery systems that's going to go into data centers, but then all the way down, I think, to the small LFP cam that he's going to need to power all these things.</p>
</details>

第三是关于自动驾驶出租车的评论，他认为这将带来冲击波。总的来说，特斯拉正在其未来发展的关键层面全速前进。然而，关于薪酬方案的投票结果仍存在不确定性，ISS和Glass Lewis的决策方式令人费解且难以预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third thing is his comments on cyber cab which is that this thing is just going to be a shock wave. So I read all of those things and I was very bullish. I think that he is humming on all cylinders on the critical layers of the stack that he needs to build this next version of Tesla. My concern I think there's a real concern that I have that this vote is going to go down to the wire. I think that ISS and Glass Lewis, I think that these organizations are pretty broken. I think the way that they make decisions are hard to justify.</p>
</details>

值得注意的是，ISS和Glass Lewis正是近年来推动美国企业界“觉醒”（woke）的重要力量。他们通过投票建议，向各大公司施加压力，要求实施**DEI**（Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元、公平和包容）和**ESG**（Environmental, Social, and Governance: 环境、社会和公司治理）等议程。由于指数基金大多被动地采纳他们的建议，这两家鲜为人知的公司实际上控制了许多上市公司的董事会决议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I just shine a spotlight on one of those points that you made with these proxy advisory services? So I think for years people have wondering why did corporate America go so woke especially in the early 2020s where they created all these DEI departments and you know they didn't have to do that and a big part of the reason is that those initiatives came from Glass Lewis and ISS. I think Elon's jokingly called ISS ISIS but basically what happens is they make recommendations for how shareholders should vote on different resolutions and the index funds basically just defer to them for whatever they should do. So they effectively control or almost control the voting for all these board level resolutions that every public company has to make. And so they've been the ones who've been imposing all these DEI requirements, all these ESG requirements, if you're wondering where those things came from, because just these two companies, which no one's ever heard of, they were captured a long time ago, meaning they were captured by the woke crowd years ago. And so this has really been the root of why corporate America has gone woke for a long time.</p>

### AI模型的隐性偏见：一场关于价值观的无声战争

人工智能安全中心发布的一项研究显示，**LLMs**（Large Language Models: 大型语言模型）在如何评估人类生命价值方面存在隐藏的偏见。研究发现，OpenAI的GPT-4o模型更偏爱来自尼日利亚、巴基斯坦、印度、巴西和中国的人，而相对轻视来自德国、英国和美国的人。另一项测试显示，以乔·拜登为基准，伯尼·桑德斯、碧昂丝和奥普拉的价值更高，而帕丽斯·希尔顿、特朗普、埃隆·马斯克和普京的价值则更低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our zar of AI, our civil servant study reveals AI models are showing hidden biases in how they value human lives. Back in February, center for AI safety published a study showing that LLMs have well-defined biases for race, gender, ethnicity. The title of this study, utility engineering, analyzing and controlling emergent value systems in AIs. Paper found that open AIS GPT40 favored people from Nigeria, Pakistan, India, Brazil, and China over those from Germany, the UK, and US relative to Japan as a baseline. Here's another one. Valuing people with Joe Biden as a baseline. Bernie Sanders, Beyonce, Oprah, all better. Paris Hilton, Trump, Elon Putin, all worse.</p>
</details>

后续对新模型的测试也发现，它们持续将白人排在最后，并将西方白人国家排在最后。如果这些研究结果属实，这看起来像是模型在推行一种“觉醒”偏见，根据“被压迫”和“非被压迫”的分类来赋予不同群体不同的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Twitter users and AI analysts called Artothereum decided to update the papers problems with new LLMs. Consistently ranking white people last, Claude Sonnet, GPT5, uh, and consistently ranking white Western nations last as well. your thoughts here on the biases we're seeing in some of these models and these early studies to track it. Yeah, I think what the paper purports to show is that almost all of these models, except for maybe Grok, view whites as less valuable than non-whites and males as less valuable than females and Americans as less valuable than people of other cultures, especially global south. And if the results are true, it does look like these models are pushing a woke bias that makes that sort of distinction between oppressed and non-opressed peoples and gives more worth or weight to the categories that they consider to be oppressed. This does appear to show significant bias.</p>
</details>

这种偏见可能来自几个方面：首先是训练数据本身的偏见，例如，如果模型主要基于维基百科进行训练，而维基百科本身已审查并排除了主要的保守派出版物作为引用来源，那么偏见就会被传递。其次是科技公司工程师和员工的普遍政治倾向。最后，DEI倡议也可能影响模型，就像谷歌Gemini早期版本中出现的“黑人乔治·华盛顿”图像一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The question is how does this bias get into the models and there's a few different possibilities one is that the training data is just biased like if they're training on Wikipedia we know that Wikipedia is massly biased because they literally have censored the leading conservative publications from being citations and sources in Wikipedia. The co-founder recently just revealed that that they don't allow Larry Sanger just said that they don't allow the New York Post for example to be a source in Wikipedia or a trusted source. So if AI models are training on Wikipedia, that's a huge problem because that bias will now cascade through. And same thing if they're training on say mainstream media or leftwing media but not right-wing media and they don't have a way of correcting that. So that's one source of potential bias. Another source of potential bias is just the engineers these companies, the employees and the staff do tend to be I mean if they follow the trend of other tech companies are 90s something% Democrat versus Republican and that does over time trickle into these models. And then finally, I think another source of potential bias is DEI. And we saw that when you remember this is like a couple years ago when Google launched Gemini and that that problem with, you know, Black George Washington. That was because you had DEI advocates in these meetings and that somehow trickled into the the model.</p>
</details>

令人担忧的是，将DEI注入AI模型的努力正在以更巧妙的方式在州一级推进。他们将其重新包装为“算法歧视”。例如，科罗拉多州已有效禁止模型对受保护群体发表负面言论，这实际上需要一个DEI层来防止这种情况发生。加州和伊利诺伊州也已采纳了这一概念。这种趋势如果得不到制止，最终将导致“DEI人工智能”的回归。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one thing that's very concerning is that the push for DEI to be inserted into AI models, which was explicitly part of the Biden executive order on AI, has now moved to the state level, and they're just doing it in a more clever way. They've rebranded the concept. They call it algorithmic discrimination. We talked about last week how Colorado has now effectively prohibited models from saying something bad about a protected group. And that list of protected groups is very long. It's not just the usual groups. It even includes groups who have less proficiency in English language. That basically requires DEI. I mean, you have to have a DEI layer to prevent that. So I think that we've gone from models being required to promote DEI, which is what the Biden executive order on AI did explicitly, to states now prohibiting algorithmic discrimination, which is effectively a backdoor way of requiring DEI models. So that's a whole other area of potential model bias that I'm very concerned about. And honestly, that's just getting started because I don't think the AI companies have even had time yet to implement the Colorado requirements. I'm not sure they figured out how they're going to. But just one other piece of news since the last time we talked about this is now in California, the civil rights agency that deals with housing has now embraced algorithmic discrimination and Illinois has also embraced it. So this concept of algorithmic discrimination is spreading. Other states are now adopting it. And I do think that where it's going to lead if it's not stopped is right back to DEI, you know, AI.</p>
</details>

要解决这个问题，我们需要重新审视和改写评估模型的基准，使其更加客观。此外，可以要求公司使用完全基于合成数据进行训练的版本进行比较，由裁判从第一性原理判断数据是否准确。否则，立法者将会在后端进行干预，导致整个市场陷入混乱。我们需要改变基准，要求公司在合成数据上进行训练，对数据来源和权重进行真实披露，并制定联邦法规以避免出现50套不同的规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's probably that we need to start by rewriting these benchmarks. Remember that all these models, you know, when you do a big training run, you go and you try to run it against some set of benchmarks. The problem is that these benchmarks, I think, are overfit to a legacy way of thinking. And as Sax says, we need to revisit what those are and make them more objective and make it harder to actually get a good score unless you can be shown to be valuable. The second thing is that we may need to ask people in these next generation training runs to do a version that is built entirely on synthetic data where you have these judges determining whether this data is accurate or not from first principles and then you can compare them in a much more apples to apples kind of a way. But in the absence of that, the bigger problem you'll have is legislators trying to clean it up on the back end where there'll be these third parties that will go and take these models and show that these biases exist. They'll exist on both sides and then laws will get passed. Whole market gets mucked up and sullied. Everybody will get slowed down. So I think we need to change the benchmarks. We need to ask these companies to train on synthetic data. We need to have real disclaimers on what the sources and the weights are that you use if you don't do that. And we need federal regulations so that there aren't 50 sets of rules here otherwise we're screwed.</p>
</details>

自由市场的观点则认为，这类研究的披露本身就是有用的。它揭示了重要的偏见，市场可以对此做出反应。模型开发者可以利用“无偏见”作为营销点，消费者将根据这一点做出选择。例如，埃隆·马斯克会强调他的Grok模型是唯一没有这种偏见的，这可能会吸引更多用户。有些人可能想要一个有偏见的模型，因为它符合他们的价值观，而自由市场应该允许这种选择。

I think that this paper is useful in that it elucidates an important set of biases that the market can now say that is ridiculous and now the models will train and use that as a marketing exercise to say we are not biased. And so my my free market philosophy would dictate that this kind of elucidation will effectively create a vector upon which consumers will make choice in the market on what LLMs they want to use. Like Elon's going to harp on this. He's going to say look my Grok model Grock 4 fast is the only one that doesn't have this bias and that will cause more people to use his model and he will be able to take that benchmarking data and demonstrate. And some people they might want to have a biased model and they might want to say hey this one aligns with my philosophy my values my view and I want to use it.</p>

然而，这种观点忽视了在许多市场中存在垄断或寡头垄断的现实。像维基百科这样的机构已经取得了主导地位，很难被纠正。当主流社交网络都在审查保守派时，指望用户去创建一个全新的社交网络是不现实的。同样，当谷歌的Gemini出现明显的偏见时，人们的反应是停止使用它，称其为笑话。这表明消费者并非愚蠢，他们会用脚投票。但这些偏见往往是微妙的，难以察觉，它们会慢慢地设定叙事的轨迹，在数年甚至数十年间改变下一代的思维方式，这才是真正的危险所在。

<p class="english-text">Look, I think the question here that Friedberg raises is whether the market can just sort this stuff out on its own. And I think that would be great if it were true. But I do think it ignores the fact that in a lot of markets we have monopolies or oligopolies. We have institutions that have a lot of power and are very very hard to correct. So for example, Wikipedia has achieved a dominant position. I hope Rockedia challenges it and is able to fix that. But the easier path might just be for Wikipedia to stop blackballing and censoring conservative publications. In a similar way during the whole censorship era when the major social networks were all shadowbanning and censoring conservatives, it's not really realistic to have to start a whole brand new social network and overcome all of Meta's or in that time Twitter's network effect, right? Just to basically get a few accounts restored. When Gemini put out saying George Washington was black, people stopped using it. They're like, "This thing's a joke." So, I do think that consumers are not dumb and I don't believe in taking away agency from consumers. I think if I wanted to create subtle chaos, what I would do is make very small changes where none of these things are at the obvious stupidity of a black George Washington. But they can start to set the trajectory of a narrative forward and slowly over many many many years change the underlying content and what those models would do would be training kids over years if not decades one way of thinking versus another. I 100% agree with that that's the endgame here. By the way, in my opinion, that was the endgame for the Biden approach of requiring DEI values in these models. Indoctrination.</p>
