### ADHD的历史与性别偏见

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您正在收听《Mistreated》。我是**Nam Kiwanuka**。据著名精神病学家**William Dodson**称，一个患有ADHD的儿童在10岁前会收到大约20,000条纠正性或负面信息。历史上，ADHD一直被视为主要影响男孩的疾病，女孩则在很大程度上被忽视。请看，尽管ADHD的症状早在1798年就被首次发现，但直到1990年代，科学才开始研究ADHD在女孩身上的表现以及它可能对她们造成的影响。ADHD在1960年代被**美国精神病学协会**（**APA**）正式认定为一种精神障碍，当时它被称为“儿童多动反应”。后来它被称为**ADD**或注意缺陷障碍。1987年，**APA**将其更名为**ADHD**，即注意缺陷多动障碍。随后在2013年，**APA**将其重新归类为一种神经发育障碍，具有三种表现形式：主要表现为多动和冲动、主要表现为注意力不集中，以及两者的结合。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You're listening to Mistreated. I'm **Nam Kiwanuka**. A child with ADHD will receive an estimated 20,000 corrective or negative messages by age 10. This according to **William Dodson**, a noted psychiatrist. Historically, ADHD has been seen as a disorder that affects primarily boys. Girls have been largely ignored. Consider that while the symptoms of ADHD were first identified back in 1798, it wasn't until the 1990s that science began to study how ADHD presents in girls, and how it might be affecting them. ADHD was formally recognized as a mental disorder by the **American Psychiatric Association**, the **APA**, in the 1960s, and back then it was called a quote hyperinetic reaction of childhood. It would later be called **ADD** or attention deficit disorder. In 1987, the **APA** changed the name to **ADHD** or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Then in 2013, the **APA** reclassified it as a neurodedevelopmental disorder with three presentations, primarily hyperactive and impulsive, primarily inattentive, and a combination of the two.

### 女性ADHD的独特表现与后果

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 在对女孩ADHD的短暂研究中，研究人员发现了它与男孩表现出的许多差异。我们大多与ADHD相关的迹象，即多动和冲动行为，通常影响男孩。而在女孩身上，它通常是第二种亚型，一种内部表现：白日梦、自责、**伪装**和分离。小时候，患有ADHD的女孩在学校往往表现良好。所以老师们常常不认为有什么问题。但许多人会**伪装**或隐藏自己的症状，以适应同伴。如果她们无法组织起来或在课堂上挣扎，这会被视为个人失败。专家表示，ADHD在女孩中的普遍程度与男孩相同，但女孩的诊断不足，而且“男孩和男性比女孩和女性更有可能被转介接受服务，即使他们的症状特征完全相同。”直到1999年，81%的ADHD研究都是针对男性进行的。因此，很容易理解为什么女性ADHD的表现未被识别或理解。但在1990年代，**Steven Henshaw**博士领导了关于ADHD如何影响女孩的开创性研究，这项研究被称为**Be Gals**或**伯克利女孩研究**。**Be Gals**研究是一个里程碑，有助于确立ADHD是女性和女孩的一种严重疾病。在**Ray Jacobson**的播客《Hyperfocus》的采访中，**Henshaw**博士这样说：“长期以来，临床医生一直认为，‘这一定是女性特有的抑郁和焦虑。ADHD是男性的事。’”**Henshaw**博士解释说，女孩未被诊断出的ADHD可能会产生“毁灭性后果”。**Beal**研究发现，患有混合型ADHD的女孩自残或自杀的风险更高。研究还发现，患有ADHD的女孩意外怀孕的风险更高，更有可能经历约会暴力和亲密伴侣暴力。患有ADHD的青少年更有可能怀孕，并且“更有可能表现出更危险的性行为”。患有ADHD的女性还患有抑郁症、自尊心低下、睡眠障碍和纤维肌痛。2025年1月发表在《英国精神病学杂志》上的一项研究发现，患有ADHD的女性寿命更短，比没有ADHD的女性短9年。在今天的节目中，我们采访了作家**Carla Chiconei**，她是在疫情期间被诊断出患有ADHD的越来越多的女性之一。我们与她谈论了“女性保护效应”、她小时候在学校感受到的挑战，以及她为什么写了《**无名女孩：ADHD失落一代的成员生活**》这本书。她现在加入了我的节目。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: In the little time ADHD has been studied in girls, researchers have discovered many differences in how it presents compared to boys. The signs that we mostly associate with ADHD, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviors are ones that usually impact boys. In girls, it's often the second subset, an internal presentation. Daydreaming, self-lame, masking, and disassociation. When they were younger. Girls with ADHD tend to do well in school. So often teachers don't think there is anything wrong. But many mask or hide their symptoms to fit in with their peers. And if they're unable to be organized or struggle in class, it is seen as a personal failing. Experts say ADHD is just as prevalent with girls as it is with boys. But girls are underdiagnosed and that quote "boys and men are more likely than girls and women to be referred for services even when their symptom profiles are exactly the same." Until 1999, 81% of ADHD studies were on men. So it is easy to see how ADHD presentation in women was not recognized or understood. But in the 1990s, **Dr. Steven Henshaw** led groundbreaking research on how ADHD impacts girls and the study has become known as the **Be Gals** or **Berkeley Girls Study**. The **Be Gals** study was a milestone and helped to establish ADHD as a serious condition for women and girls. In an interview on the podcast Hyperfocus with **Ray Jacobson**, **Dr. Henshaw** said this. For way too long, clinicians have thought, "Well, it must be depression and anxiety that goes along with being female. ADHD is a guy thing." **Dr. Henshaw** explained that undiagnosed ADHD in girls can have quote "devastating consequences." The **Beal** study found that girls with the combined type of ADHD were at a higher risk of selfharming or attempting suicide. Studies have also found that girls with ADHD were at higher risk of unplanned pregnancies, more likely to experience dating violence and intimate partner violence. Teens with ADHD are more likely to become pregnant, and quote, "are more likely to exhibit riskier sexual behaviors." Women with ADHD also suffer from depression, low self-esteem, sleep disorders, and fibromyalgia. A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in January 2025, found that women with ADHD have a shorter lifespan, 9 years shorter than women without. On today's episode, we speak to writer **Carla Chiconei**, who became one of the growing numbers of women to be diagnosed with ADHD during the pandemic. We speak to her about the quote "female protective effect," the challenges she felt in school as a young child, and why she wrote the book **Nowhere Girl: Life as a member of ADHD's Lost Generation**. She joins me now.

### 《无名女孩》的诞生

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 欢迎来到播客。很高兴您能来。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Welcome to the podcast. It's so nice to have you here.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 谢谢您的邀请。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Thank you for having me.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您的书真是令人惊叹。您谈论了许多不同的事情。正如我们开始录制前我告诉您的，我们会在您感到舒适的地方进行。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Oh, can I just say your book is just like breathtaking. You talk about so many different things and as I said to you before we started recording, we go where you're comfortable.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Okay.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 好的。首先，谁是“**无名女孩**”？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Okay. But first off, who are the **Nowhere girls**?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 哦，我们是一群女性和女孩，长期以来一直被科学研究排除在外。我们太晚才了解到我们的大脑运作方式不同，我们生活中许多自责的事情不一定是我们的错。那是因为我们患有ADHD、自闭症或其他神经多样性。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Oh, well, we are a group of women and girls who were kind of left out of scientific research for a really long time and learned a little bit too late that our brains operate differently and that so much of what we blamed ourselves for in our life isn't necessarily our fault. It's because we have ADHD or autism or other neurode divergence. So,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 科学只是忘了把你们包括进去。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: and science just forgot to include you.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们会更多地谈论**无名女孩**，但我想先和您谈谈。这是一本回忆录，但您也做了很多研究和历史考证。我们稍后会回到那个话题。但在COVID封锁期间，还记得那段时间吗？那真是太有趣了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We'll talk more about The **Nowhere Girls**, but I wanted to talk to you first. This is a memoir, but it's also you've done a lot of studies and historical research on it. Yeah, we'll come we'll get back to that in just a second. But during COVID lockdowns, remember that time? It's so much fun.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 现在感觉像一场梦。像一场噩梦。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: It feels like a dream now. Like a nightmare,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 对吧？我回想起来，就觉得“哦，这就是为什么现在一切都变成这样了。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: right? It's just like I look back, I'm like, "Oh, that's why everything's the way it is now."

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 它没有恢复。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: it didn't recover.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们没有恢复。它把一切都打破了。但在COVID期间，您39岁，是一个蹒跚学步孩子的母亲，您被正式诊断出患有**ADHD**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We did not recover. It broke everything. But, during COVID, at age 39, you're a mother to a toddler. You were officially diagnosed with ADHD.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您还被诊断出患有抑郁症、广泛性焦虑症（**GAD**）和**完美主义**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You were also diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder or **GAD**, and perfectionism.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes.

</details>

### 迟来的诊断与内心挣扎

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 诊断后，您写道：“起初，您发现无法谈论ADHD。为什么？”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: After the diagnosis, you write that quote, "You found it impossible to talk about ADHD at first. How come?"

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我想是因为我对ADHD的刻板印象是它是一种小男孩的疾病，而且是多动和捣乱的，不是我上学时想与之扯上关系的类型。所以我认为我有很多羞耻感，仅仅是因为我对ADHD的错误认知。当时我也主要和家人在一起，他们并没有和我走上同样的旅程，对吧？他们没有研究ADHD。他们对心理健康和正在发生的事情没有过度关注。所以我不太舒服和他们谈论，因为他们会说“哦，是的，每个人都有那个。”我得到了这样的回应。所以，这只是我独自经历的事情。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I think because I had the stereotype of ADHD of being a little boy's disorder and and like hyper and hyperactive and disruptive and kind of like not the kind of kid I wanted to be associated with when I was in school. And so I think I had a lot of shame just from my misperception of what ADHD was. I also I also was hanging out with mostly my family members at the time who who weren't on the same journey as me, right? They weren't researching ADHD. They weren't overly concerned with mental health and what was going on. So, I wasn't comfortable talking to them about it because they kind of, oh yeah, everybody has that. Like, I got those kind of responses. So, it was something that was I just went through on my own.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这很有趣，因为您确实写到了您的家人和您的成长经历。所以，在您内心深处，您担心患有ADHD会带来的污名，但这并不是您过去行为的答案，而是让您变得更加与众不同。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, it it's interesting because you do write about your family and how you grew up. So, the back of your mind, you were worried about the stigma attached to you having ADHD, but not it not being an answer to maybe the way that you were, but something that made you even more different.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的，我想是这样。而且我认为，当您试图与一个还没准备好、不想听或与您想法不同的人进行开放和诚实的心理健康对话时，没有什么比这更糟糕的了。所以我认为我把很多事情都藏在心里，因为我周围的人与我不在同一频道。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah, I think so. And I think, you know, there's there's nothing worse than trying to have open and honest conversations about mental health with somebody who doesn't isn't ready to or doesn't want to hear it or isn't on the same page as you. And so I think I kept a lot to myself because the people I was around weren't weren't on the same page.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您得到的诊断之一是**完美主义**。您这样写道：“虽然我对这些诊断心存感激，包括我预期的和令我惊讶的，但我也为此感到困扰，主要是因为它们解释了我为什么如此挣扎，但却没有提供出路。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: One of the diagnoses that you received was perfectionism. And you write this. While I was grateful for the diagnosis, both the ones I was expecting and the ones that surprised me, I was also bothered by them, mostly because they provided reasons for why I was struggling so hard, but they didn't offer a way out. Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您这是什么意思？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What did you mean by this?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 嗯，我的意思是，当您得到诊断时，我得到了兴奋剂药物的处方，但我没有得到一本关于如何带着这四种刚刚被诊断出的疾病生活的指导手册。所以，对我来说，这又是一个孤独的过程。我服用了兴奋剂药物，这让我的日常生活轻松了一些。但对我来说，我必须回去重新审视我一直以来对自己生活讲述的故事，这花费了大量的时间和治疗。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Well, I mean, when you get a diagnosis, I got a prescription for stimulant medication, but I didn't get a a handbook on how to live your life with these four disorders that you just got diagnosed with. So, again, it was kind of a lonely process for me. So, I got on the stimulant medication, which made my dayto-day a bit easier. But for me, I had to go back and unpack sort of the story I'd been telling myself about my life and that took a lot of time and it and therapy.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您写到了一个与众不同的童年。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, you write about a childhood where you were different

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 您觉得这种不同是您的错。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: and you felt like you were to blame for that difference.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您被称为“懒惰”。您在学校表现很好，直到后来不行了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You were called lazy. You did well in school until you didn't.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您很难交到朋友，也很难在这些关系中感到安全。但您写道：“我与精神疾病的关系很复杂，这与我成长在一个工人阶级第一代家庭的经历相符。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You had a hard time making friends and feeling secure in those relationships. But you're right, my relationship to mental illness was complicated and in line with someone who grew up in a workingclass first generation family.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我看待它的方式，就像我带着好奇和不信任看待那些在披萨上放菠萝的人一样。我其实喜欢菠萝披萨。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I looked at it the same way I did those who put pineapple and pizza with intrigue and distrust. I actually like pineapple pizza.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 没关系，这是一个安全的空间。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's okay. This is a safe space.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这是一个安全的空间。但是，当我读到它时，我为您感到高兴，因为您可能感受到了所有这些事情，但也许您只是觉得，好吧，那不是我。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: This is a safe space. But like I I'm just cuz I'm when I was reading it, I was rooting for you in the sense of like maybe you felt all these things, but maybe you just kind of felt, okay, it wasn't me.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 还有其他事情正在发生。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Something else was going on.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 就像一种解脱感，但您感到愤怒、压力。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Like a sense of relief, but you felt angry, stressed.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的，我的意思是，当您这么晚才被诊断出患有伴随您一生的疾病时，这很复杂。我感受到了所有这些情绪：愤怒、沮丧，而且还有一种不被理解的感觉，对吧？因为我经历的很多事情都被归咎于性格缺陷，就像您提到的，比如您懒惰，或者您轻浮，或者您不是一个认真的人，等等。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. I mean, it's complicated when you get diagnosed so late with something that you have had all your life. I felt I I felt all those things. angry, frustrated, and also just sort of unseen, right? Because I, so much of what I went through, was blamed on personality defects, like you mentioned, like you're lazy or you're, you know, you're flighty or you're not a serious person or whatever. So,

</details>

### ADHD对日常生活的挑战

**Nam Kiwanuka**: ADHD是如何出现在您的生活中的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: how did ADHD show up in your life?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 嗯，当时它出现在我的育儿方式中。所以，我激励自己的主要方式总是对自己非常严厉，以促使自己行动起来完成事情，因为患有ADHD的人缺乏**执行功能**。所以，那些让您日常生活更轻松的小事，我们不会自然而然地去做。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Well, at the time it it showed up in parent in my parenting. So, it was my main way of motivating myself was always to be really mean to myself to sort of spur myself into to action to get the things done because with ADHD you lack executive function. So, the little things that like make your day easier, we don't we don't naturally do those things

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 比如准时起床。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: like getting up on time.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 准时起床，或者只是计划您的一天，比如知道一天中要优先处理什么，知道您需要做的事情以及正确的顺序。我经常会因为害怕做这些事情而感到麻痹，然后什么都不做。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: getting up on time or just like planning your day, like knowing what to prioritize in your day, knowing the things you need to do and like the right order to do them in. Often what I will do is get sort of like paralyzed with fear about doing those things and then not do any of them.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这让一切变得更糟。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, which makes everything worse.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 它让一切变得更糟，然后您会恐慌，然后您会在最后匆忙完成。有时它会奏效，因为当我们真正需要时，我们有能力**超聚焦**。所以，如果我有一个重要的截止日期，而且我几乎要错过了，我就可以通宵达旦地完成。我的意思是，现在不那么多了，因为我老了，有了孩子，但以前我可以。但是的，这些小事真的会累积起来，所以我感觉您年纪越大，这些事情就越明显，您在这些方面落后了，因为成年人的生活对您来说要困难得多，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: It makes everything worse and then you panic and then you you do it in a rush at the end. Sometimes it works out because we have the ability to hyperfocus when when we really need to. And so like if I have a big deadline and I'm almost missing it, like I can pull an allnighter and like and do it. I mean less now because I'm old and child but like I humbled my age. Yes. But I could. Um but yeah, so those those little things um they really add up and so I feel like the older you get, the more that it is more apparent how behind you are in those things because doing adult life is just so much harder for you, right?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我想也是，因为我注意到网上有很多妈妈发现她们会说：“哦，也许我患有ADHD。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And I guess too cuz I'm noticing online a lot of moms are finding out that they're like, "Oh, maybe I have ADHD."

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

### 激素与女性ADHD

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您认为这是为什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What do you think that is?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 嗯，这很有趣，因为是的，每当有大的荷尔蒙紊乱时，比如青春期、生完孩子后、围绝经期或绝经期，您的雌激素（对您的大脑有保护作用）就会下降。所以我认为这就是我们所看到的，当一个新妈妈，她的生活一团糟，她会想“哦，我患有ADHD吗？”我认为这里面有一个巨大的荷尔蒙因素。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Well, it's interesting because Yeah. when anytime there's like a big hormonal disrupt like when puberty or after you have a baby or in pmenopause or menopause your estrogen which has like a protective effect on your brain is dipping and so I think that that's what we're seeing like when when there's a new mom and she's like you know her life is a mess and she's like oh do I have ADHD I think there's a huge hormonal equation there

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 当我们谈论药物时，我想回到那个话题。是的。但是，您为这本书做了很多研究，它是一本回忆录，但也是关于女孩如何甚至不被认为是患有ADHD的历史。**Steven Henshaw**是谁？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I want to come back to that in a it when we talk about medication. Yes. But you did a lot of research for the book, it's memoir, but it's also the history of how girls were not even considered to have ADHD. Who is **Steven Henshaw**?

</details>

### 伯克利女孩研究

**Carla Chiconei**: 我很喜欢**Steven Henshaw**。他是**加州大学伯克利分校**的教授，他是90年代第一个研究患有ADHD女孩的研究员。他做了一项名为**Be Gals**的研究，这项研究观察了6到13岁的女孩，他从那时起一直跟踪她们。所以现在她们大概40到50岁了。所以她们提供了我们拥有的第一项关于患有ADHD女性的纵向研究，因此在她们的生活中，我们可以看到很多趋势和我们所有人之间的许多共性。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I love **Steven Henshaw**. He's a professor at the **University of California, Berkeley**, and he was the first researcher to look at girls with ADHD in the '9s. So he did a study called **be gals** and it was a study that looked at I think sixy olds to 13y olds and he's followed them since that time. So now they're like 40 in their 40s and 50s I think. Um, and so they give they're they're the first longitudinal study we have of women with ADHD that and so in their lives we can see a lot of the trends and a lot of the commonalities between us all.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，我的意思是，他做这件事真是太棒了，因为当时这甚至不是讨论的一部分。那么他发现了ADHD以及它如何影响女孩的什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, I mean it's amazing that he um did that because at the time it wasn't even part of the conversation. So what did he find about ADHD and how it impacts girls?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 他发现这是一种更内在的体验，当青春期来临时，如果它没有被识别出来，很多时候就会变成焦虑和抑郁。因此，在这个年龄段的女孩中存在很多误诊，因为荷尔蒙会占据主导地位，抑郁症会根深蒂固，这才是首先被识别出来的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: So he found that it's it's a more internal experience and what happens is when puberty hits a lot of that if it hasn't been identified it turns into anxiety and depression. And so there's a lot of misdiagnosing girls in that age group because the hor hormones take over and depression takes hold and that's what gets identified first.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 当您说“内在”时，我想当我们认为患有ADHD时，我们脑海中浮现的是一个在课堂上非常多动、捣乱的男孩的形象，但对于女孩来说，更多的是发生在她们内心的事情。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And when you when you say internal um I guess when we have a what we think is ADHD we have the image of the boy who's really hyper disruptive in class but for girls it's more something that's happening inside them.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。所以它有点像同样的多动症。所以这种类型被称为**注意力不集中型ADHD**，男性也可以有，不只是女孩，但主要是女孩患有。它就是那种向内转的多动症。所以，有很多白日梦，比如在课堂上听课，但实际上没有听到老师在说什么。有很多忘记作业，在最后一刻才做，但仍然完成了。所以，没有人真正注意到您在挣扎，因为这一切都发生在您内心。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. So it's kind of that same hyperactivity. So it's called inattentive ADHD this type and and men can have it too. It's not just girls but it's predominantly girls that get it. And it is that hyperactivity sort of turned inward. So, it's a lot of daydreaming, like listening in class, but not actually hearing what the teacher is saying. It's a lot of like forgetting your homework and doing it at the last minute, but still doing it. So, nobody's noticing that you are struggling with anything really because it's all happening within you.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 也许是反刍思维，就像，
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Rumination maybe like,

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 哦，是的，大量的反刍思维。所以您
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: oh yeah, rumination big time. So you

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，因为您有那种情绪失调的部分，您知道我们会有这些非常强烈的感觉，却不知道如何管理它们，而这与所有其他事情结合在一起，就会导致很多**低自尊**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: yeah because you have you have that emotional dysregulation piece of you know we get these really big feelings and don't know how to manage them and that combined with all the other stuff is just kind of like it it turns into a lot of low self-esteem.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您写到了**伪装**、自责，以及在学校，尤其是在早期，可能会在学校表现良好，我实际上经常被认为是**有天赋的**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You write about masking self-lame and then in school especially in the early years might do well in school and I actually often consider to be gifted.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。但在学校里，没有针对ADHD的**伪装筛查工具**。目前ADHD的筛查和诊断工具都是基于对男孩进行的研究。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes. But in schools, there isn't a masking screening tool for ADHD. And the current screening and diagnostic tools for ADHD were based on research that was done on boys.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这对患有ADHD并在内心挣扎的年轻女孩有什么危害？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: How does this harm young girls who have ADHD and are struggling internally?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我认为这可能是导致患有ADHD的女孩**低自尊**的最大因素，因为这是一种非常孤独的经历。她们能否获得良好的学校体验，完全取决于她们的老师是否了解ADHD，并能否在一个可能未被诊断的孩子身上识别出来，这对老师来说是一项艰巨的任务。您需要一位非常有爱心和敏锐的老师才能做到这一点。然后您可能有一年遇到这样的老师，然后又遇到一个完全不理解的老师。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I think that that's like the biggest contributor to to the low self-esteem that we see in girls with ADHD is that it's such a lonely experience. And whether they get a like a good school experience or not is fully dependent on if their teacher understands ADHD and can identify it in a kid that maybe hasn't been diagnosed, which is a huge task for a teacher. And you need a very caring and astute teacher to even be able to do that. And then you might have a teacher like that one year and then have a teacher that's completely not understanding.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以对学生来说是起起伏伏的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So it's up and down for the student.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 而且我认为我的经历也是如此。有些年份我遇到了更理解我的老师，他们知道如何与我建立联系，了解我的兴趣，并鼓励我。而有些年份则完全相反。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: And I think like my experience was like that too. Like some years I had more understanding teachers that, you know, knew how to connect with me and my interests and kind of like encourage me. And some years it was the complete opposite. So um there was a lot of um different things that you wrote about in the book that just broke my heart, took my breath away.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您引用了一项研究，该研究表明：“据估计，患有ADHD的儿童在10岁前会收到20,000条以上的纠正性或负面信息，因此他们的**自尊心**会受到影响。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, but it's um you cited a study that showed that quote, "It's estimated that a child with ADHD receives 20,000 more corrective or negative messages by age 10 and their self-esteem suffers as a result."

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 作为一名母亲，现在回首自己的童年，您有什么想法？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, as a mother now and looking back on your own childhood, you think what?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 哦，我的意思是，我能感受到那20,000条信息的影响。我年轻时感受到了它们，现在仍然能感受到。所以我认为，我的意思是，这是我写这本书并试图改变我与自己对话和育儿方式的一个重要原因，因为我知道我肩负着养育一个小女孩的责任，她很像我。所以，当您成为父母时，听到自己父母的自动反应真是太奇怪了，它来得如此突然。您会想：“等等，我不想那样和您说话。那句话是从哪里来的？”所以，我认为我需要改变这一点，并学习一种不同的育儿方式，这对我来说意义重大。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Oh, I mean, I I can feel the effects of the 20,000. I felt like I felt them when I was young and I can still feel them. So, I think that I mean that's a big part of the reason why I wanted to write this book and to sort of change the way I was talking to myself and parenting myself because I knew I had this job of parenting a little girl and who was a lot like me. And so I could It's so weird when you become a parent, you kind of hear the automatic reactions of your own parents and it comes so out of nowhere. you're like, "Wait, I didn't want to I didn't want to talk to you like that. Where did that come from?" And so, I think the idea that I needed to change that and like learn a different way of parenting her, it was huge for me.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这很难。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And it's hard.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 太难了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: It's so hard

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 因为您感受到了，因为您经历过那些事情。您想保护他们免受那些伤害。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: because it's like you feel it because you experienced those things. You want to protect them from that.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但您被养育的方式是在一个没有人理解您发生了什么的环境中。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But then the way you were parented was in an environment where no one understood what was going on with you.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 当然。是的。是的。所以有了这种意识，并不一定会让事情变得更容易。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Of course. Yeah. Yeah. And so having this awareness, it doesn't necessarily make it easier.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您可能对自己更严厉。是的。对。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You probably are harder on yourself. Yeah. Right.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。这是另一个对自己严厉的理由。所以这是一个滑坡。我确实认为我看到很多女性，尤其是在社交媒体上，会说：“我需要温柔地养育孩子，我需要做这些事情才能成为一个好妈妈。”其中一部分很棒，我很高兴人们这样想，但它似乎也成了女性对自己严厉的下一个途径，就是过度分析我们的育儿方式并沉迷于此。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. It is another reason to be hard on yourself. So it is a slippery slope there. And I do think I see a lot of women, you know, especially on social media, you know, being like, I need to parent gentle and I these are the things I need to do to be a good mom. And a a part of that is great and I'm glad people are thinking that way, but also it does seem to be like the next avenue that women are being hard on ourselves for is like just overanalyzing our parenting and fixating on it.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，孩子们真的很让人谦卑。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah, kids are very humbling.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 在很多方面。嗯，在写这本书时，您对**无名女孩**进行了一项调查，您写道：“在回答我关于童年创伤问题的**无名女孩**中，高达90%的人表示她们经历过创伤。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: In so many ways. Um, so in writing in this book, you did a survey with the **Nowhere Girls** and you write that quote, "A staggering 90% of nowhere girls who answered my question about childhood trauma said they experienced it." Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这让您震惊吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, did that shock you?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 这让我很难过，但没有震惊我，因为我的故事充满了童年创伤，而且通过与**Henshaw**博士的交谈，我有点知道他研究的女孩也有更高的童年创伤和药物滥用率，以及所有这些。所以我有点预料到了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: It was It saddened me, but it didn't shock me because I mean my own story was full of childhood trauma and from speaking with **Dr. Henshaw**, I kind of knew that the girls he had studied also had a higher rates of childhood trauma and substance use and all of that. So I was kind of expecting it. But

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您能再解释一下吗？所以它是遗传性的，还是如果发生了一些事情，比如表观遗传学？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: can you explain that a bit more? So is it genetic or is it if something happens to you like epigenetic?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 所以它是遗传性的。它是可遗传的。所以80%。所以就像如果您的父母有，您也有80%的机会患上它。但是，是的，**表观遗传学**，您成长的环境，如果它是平静、和平、有组织的，并且，您知道，因为正确的原因而赞扬您，您可能很长时间都不会发展出ADHD，或者可能不会表现出它的症状。也许直到您成为母亲，您才会发现，哦，我所拥有的一切都崩溃了，那时您才开始表现出ADHD的症状。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: So it it is genetic. It's heritable. So 80%. So it's like if your if your parents had it, you have 80% chance of also getting it. But yes, the epigenetics, the environment that you grew up in, if it was calm and peaceful and organized and, you know, praised you for the right reasons, you might not develop ADHD for a long time or might not show the symptoms of it. And maybe it'll take you until like you become a mother and you're like, oh, like everything that I had in place has fallen away and that's when you start expressing symptoms of ADHD.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但有一种叫做“**女性保护效应**”的东西。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But there is something called the female protective effect.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那是什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What's that?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 所以，那是因为女性从很小的时候就承担了额外的责任，我们学会了如何**伪装**，我们的生活以一种保护我们免受一切崩溃和ADHD症状接管的方式建立起来。这就是为什么有时需要更长的时间。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: So it's um because women have I think extra responsibilities on them from when they're quite young and we learn how to sort of mask and our lives are kind of set up in a way that protects us from everything falling away and and the ADHD symptoms taking over. Um that's why sometimes it takes longer.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您在书中更多地写到了**伪装**。您能解释一下那是什么吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You write about masking more in the book. Can you explain what that is?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。所以**伪装**，我的意思是，它有点像戴上面具，这样您就可以融入您的生活，并且也能完成您一天中需要完成的事情。我之前谈到**执行功能障碍**，很多人使用**伪装**来完成日常任务，我过去常常通过对自己严厉和激励自己来做到这一点，比如“加油，您能做到！”**伪装**的很大一部分也是社交上的融洽相处，以及融入不同的群体。在学校里，我有点像从那些我认为做得很好的朋友那里收集特质，然后试穿一下，我想我现在仍然带着一些这样的特质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. So masking is I mean it kind of is a way of um putting on a mask so that you can blend in in your life and also just like achieve what you need to achieve throughout the day. Like I was talking about executive dysfunction earlier and a lot of people use masking to just get through the tasks of the day and I used to do that by being mean to myself and motivating myself by being like come on you can do this. It's also a a huge part of masking is getting along socially and um blending into different groups and in school I kind of like collected traits from from my friends that I thought were like doing doing it well and then just sort of tried them on for size and I think I still carry some of that with me now. Right.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 因为您的妈妈注意到，就像您在书中写到的，您的妈妈注意到了这一点。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Uh because your mom meant like when you're in the book you write about how your mom picked up on that.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。您在某些友谊中，您开始变得更像那个人。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes. that you would um within certain friendships that you had, you started being more like that person.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您说ADHD的遗传率为80%。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You said that ADHD you inherited like 80%.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以现在您知道了您有它。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So now that you know you have it

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您回首自己的家庭。一切都说得通了吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um does everything make sense.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 哦，是的。非常混乱。是的，确实说得通。而且，您知道，我父亲那边有一个姑姑，她在55岁时被诊断出来。所以，更容易指出是家族基因的这一侧是它的来源。但是，是的，很难，因为我们也是意大利人。所以，大声喧哗、互相插话、打断别人，就像是，我们有ADHD还是我们只是意大利人？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Oh yeah. Very chaotic. Um yes it does make sense. And you know, I I have an aunt on my dad's side who was diagnosed when she was 55. So, it's kind of like easier to point to that side of the family's genes as um where it's coming from. But just yeah, the but it's it's hard because we're also Italian. So, like the loudness, the talking over each other, the interrupting, it's like, do we have ADHD or are we just Italian?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以您可以看到为什么我们可能需要更长的时间才能被诊断出来。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So you could see why it might might take us longer to get diagnosed.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您被诊断出患有ADHD后，和家人有过交流吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Have you had conversations with your family since you had ADHD?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。您知道，我提到的姑姑，她非常热衷于ADHD教育和了解更多，我们进行了一些非常好的对话。我的父母并没有那么感兴趣，但我认为他们仍然认为这有点像一个借口。而且很难摆脱那种将心理健康问题视为弱点的思维模式。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes. And you know um my aunt who I mentioned, she's she's very into like the ADHD education and and learning more and we've had some really good conversations. Um my parents aren't as I think they're interested in it, but it's more just like I think they still think of it as a bit of an excuse. And it's really hard to get out of that mindset of like, you know, viewing mental health issues as weakness.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以和他们谈论ADHD更难。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, so it is harder to talk to them about about ADHD.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。是的。是的。我的意思是，我能理解他们，因为我明白那来自哪里。但是，是的，不能谈论它很难。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I I can I can empathize with them because I understand where that came from. But yeah, it's it's hard to not be able to.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 还有一件事，就像一旦您成为父母，我感觉我与父母的关系并不好。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: That's another thing like once you become a parent, I I feel like um I didn't have the best relationships with my parents.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但自从我有了孩子，我更理解他们了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But since I had kids, I understand them more.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您可以理解他们是如何发展以及为什么他们是那样的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um you can understand how how they develop and why they were the way they were.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。我想我给了他们更多的宽容。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. I think I show them more grace.

</details>

### 误诊与社会污名

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您在书中也写道：“在ADHD之前，女性被诊断出抑郁症和焦虑症，或被误诊为情绪障碍，这是如此普遍，基本上是一种必经之路。”您还写道：“对我来说，女性ADHD最令人震惊的误诊之一，也是最常见的误诊之一，是**双相情感障碍II型**（**BD**）。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um you write in the book too that quote "being diagnosed with depression and anxiety or misdiagnosed with a mood disorder long before ADHD is so customary among women. It's basically a right of passage. And quote, "To me the most shocking misdiagnosis for women with ADHD is also one of the most common uh bipolar 2 disorder or BD."

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 为什么会这样？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Why is that?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 嗯，对于**双相情感障碍**，您会有躁狂发作和抑郁发作。所以，如果ADHD没有及早被识别出来，并且这些模式根深蒂固，我能理解为什么您可能会被误诊为这种疾病，因为您的**超聚焦**、热情和冲动可能会被误读为躁狂。但区别在于，**双相情感障碍**始于青春期。所以发作始于青春期，而ADHD则在此之前很久就开始了，这就是为什么进行彻底评估以弄清楚发生了什么非常重要，因为我有一些朋友被误诊为**双相情感障碍**，并且服用了错误的药物长达10年。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Well, so with bipolar disorder, you get um like manic episodes and then depressive episodes. And so if ADHD doesn't get identified early and these patterns sort of take hold, I could see why you might get misdiagnosed with this because your hyperfocusing and your enthusiasm and your impulsivity might be misread as mania. But the difference is um with a bipolar you that starts in um adolescence. So the episodes start in adolescence whereas ADHD it starts long before then which is why it's really important to get a thorough assessment to figure out like what's going on cuz I've had friends who were misdiagnosed with bipolar and on the wrong medication for like 10 years and

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那会造成很大的伤害，不是吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: that causes a lot of harm, doesn't it?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。是的。嗯，但我也能理解为什么会发生这种情况，因为从历史上看，如果您没有考虑过女性和女孩患有ADHD，
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I can also see why that's happening because historically women, if you haven't considered that women and girls have ADHD,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 您就不会把她们归入那个类别。您甚至不会考虑它。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: you won't put them in that category. You won't even consider it.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以，另一种**双相情感障碍**更多地被认为是女性的疾病。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, the other bipolar is like thought of more as like a women's disorder.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 为什么会这样，**Carla**？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And why is that, Carla?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 因为**性别歧视**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Because sexism.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们在笑，但是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We're laughing, but

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。我的意思是，女性心理健康的历史并不是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. I mean, the history of women's mental health is like not

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那是**歇斯底里**，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's hysteria, right?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。那是**歇斯底里**。它就是从那里来的。而且，您知道，他们愿意诊断女性的疾病是**歇斯底里**的诊断，而不是，您知道，更典型的男性诊断，比如自闭症或ADHD。他们甚至没有想到这一点。所以，我也能理解为什么家庭可能想避开像ADHD这样的诊断，也是因为那种**污名**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. It's hysteria. That's where it comes from. And you know, what they were willing to diagnose women with were the hysterical diagnosis versus, you know, the more typical male diagnosis of like autism or ADHD. They they didn't even think of that. So, which also I can see why families might want to shy away from a diagnosis like ADHD because of that stigma, too,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 对吧？所以伤害就像多米诺骨牌效应。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: right? So the harm just kind of dominal effect.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的，当然。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah, for sure.

</details>

### 女性ADHD的其他并发症

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 患有ADHD的女性还可能患有哪些其他疾病？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, what other conditions are women with ADHD likely to have?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 哦，太多了。我的意思是，我们很多人都**过度活动**，这意味着我们的关节更容易弯曲，但因此我们的身体也会有更多的疼痛。这是我直到去看理疗师才了解到的。还有更多的抑郁和焦虑，正如您提到的。甚至还有湿疹、哮喘和糖尿病等疾病。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Oh, so many. Um, I mean a lot of us are hyper mobile, so meaning like our joints bend more easily, but also we have more pain in our bodies because of that. And um, that's something I didn't even know about until I went to this like physiotherapist who told me about it. Um, but there's more depression and anxiety as you mentioned. Um, even things like eczema and asthma and diabetes,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 口吃也是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: stutters too.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的，口吃、抽动，各种各样的，基本上您能想到的一切在这个人群中都更常见。您写道，也有“新证据表明，一些患有**厌食症**的女孩实际上可能患有**自闭症**，但因为它不是典型的男性症状，所以被忽视了。类似的ADHD研究也存在，但研究范围不大。”而且还有“ADHD、**饮食失调**和**性别焦虑**之间的联系。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah, stutters, ticks, all sorts of like basically everything you can think of is more common in this population. Um, you're right that there is also quote emerging evidence that some girls with anorexia may in fact be suffering from autism, but because it's not a typical male symptom, it's been missed. Similar studies exist for ADHD, but the pool of research is not large. Um, and there is also quote a connection between ADHD, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我只是想把一切都扔出去。您还写道：“尽管对患有ADHD的女性研究不足，但有大量令人沮丧的证据表明，这种疾病使我们面临更高的不健康浪漫关系、更高的离婚率和更不满意的性关系的风险。它还大大增加了经历**亲密伴侣暴力**的可能性。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And I'm not I was just like I want to throw everything against the wall. and that quote, "Despite women with ADHD being underresarched, there is depressing amount of evidence that the disorder puts us at an increased risk of for unhealthy romantic relationships, higher divorce rates, and more unsatisfying sexual relationships. It also substantially increases the likelihood of experiencing intimate partner violence.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 感觉这些都是非常大的事情。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: it just feels like these are really big things."

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我知道。但我的意思是，我说的就是，您能想到的一切坏事在这个人群中发生得更多。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I know. But I meant what I said when it's kind of like everything bad you can think of happens more in this population.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您为什么想写这本书？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Why did you want to write this book?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 因为这是一本我被诊断时想要的书。我的意思是，我收到了很多患有ADHD的人发来的信息，他们找到了这本书，都说“这就是我需要读的东西”，这让我对所经历的一切感觉好多了。是的。我为自己和所有其他**无名女孩**写了这本书。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Because I it was a book that I I wanted when I got diagnosed and I I mean I've gotten so many messages from people who have ADHD and have found the book and have been just like this is what I needed to read and has made me feel so much better about everything that I've gone through. Um, yeah. I I I wrote it for myself and all the other **Nowhere girls**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么，您现在更了解自己了吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, do you understand yourself better now?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我想是吧。我感觉我有点太了解自己了。我对自己的一切都过度了解。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: I think so. Like I feel like I understand myself a little too well. I'm like over aware of everything.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但您现在一定对自己更宽容了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But there must be some grace that you show yourself now.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。是的。我认为那是我最大的，我希望这本书最终的收获是，我们无法真正控制我们能获得什么。我们无法控制我们是否能获得使ADHD生活更轻松的资源，但我们可以控制努力对自己更好。因为我们很多人都挣扎于同样的自动负面思维模式，我们至少可以尝试说：“哦，我又在那样做了。我试图，您知道，通过对自己严厉来激励自己。我要退一步，我只是要努力对自己好一点。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes. Yeah. And I think that was like my biggest my ultimate I wanted the ultimate takeaway of the book to be um like we can't really control what we have access to. We can't control if we have access to the resources that make life with ADHD easier, but we can control working on being nicer to ourselves. cuz so many of us struggle with that same like automatic negative patterns of thinking that we can at least try to say, "Oh, I'm doing that again. I'm trying to, you know, motivate myself by being mean to myself. I'm going to take a step back and I'm just going to like try to be nice to myself."

### 呼吁系统性改变

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **Carla**，和您交谈真是太愉快了。我只剩下几分钟了。但是我想和您谈谈一些解决方案，也许政策制定者可以做些什么。我们谈到青春期发生的荷尔蒙变化。由于女性和女孩不被认为会受到ADHD的影响，所以对ADHD的研究一直以男孩为中心，以至于如果有人需要ADHD药物，这种药物从未研究过它如何影响女性在青春期、怀孕或围绝经期时的荷尔蒙。这相当令人震惊。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, it's been so nice talking to you, Carla. I only have a few more minutes left. Um, but I wanted to talk to you about some solutions and maybe um what policy makers can do. Uh we talked a little bit about the hormonal shift that happens in adolescence. And because women and girls weren't considered to be impacted by ADHD, the research on ADHD has centered around boys to the point where if someone needs medication for ADHD, that medication wasn't studied on how it impacts women's hormones through puberty, pregnancy, or pmenopause. Yeah. Which is quite shocking.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 这确实令人震惊。我在书中采访了一位瑞典医生，他们有一种不同的护理模式，基本上是妇科医生与精神病学家和心理学家合作，为这个ADHD人群服务，以确定人们需要的是荷尔蒙还是ADHD药物。我只是觉得这太棒了。您能想象如果我们的医生能够像那样协作工作，并为我们，为个体患者做到最好吗？因为很多时候，我们都被要求自己去解决问题，而且，您知道，如果您患有ADHD，您通常很难整理事情。所以，如果医疗系统能支持您，那会非常好。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: It is shocking. And I I spoke with um a Swedish doctor in the book who they have a different model of care that is basically gynecologists are working with psychiatrists and psychologists for this ADHD population to see whether it is hormones that people need or ADHD medication. And I just think that's so lovely. Can you just imagine if our doctors were able to work together collaborative collaboratively like that and just figure out like do the do the best for us like for the individual patients cuz so much of it is just put on us to figure out and you know if you have ADHD you have a you have a hard time just sorting things out in general. So it would be really nice to have like the healthare system backing you up.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您写到了您是如何获得ADHD诊断的，而且您已经是系统的一部分了。但是对于其他人来说，这似乎要花费很多钱。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: you wrote about like the how you came upon your ADHD diagnosis and you already part of the system. Um but for other people it's it seems to cost a lot of money.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yes.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 而且您还必须对“我是否患有这种疾病？”抱有好奇心。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And you also have to have the curiosity around do I have this thing?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。而且您必须首先对它有所了解，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. And you have to have some knowledge of it first, right?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。那么您想对政策制定者说些什么，关于纠正这一点的紧迫性？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes. So what what do you want to say to policy makers about the urgency in course correcting this?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 嗯，我上次查阅时，我认为家庭医生在培训中只学习了半天的ADHD。所以他们没有接受过关于ADHD在女性甚至成年男性中表现的培训。而且我知道当我第一次向我的家庭医生咨询时，她说：“我很抱歉。我对此了解不够，无法给您评估。”所以我认为，如果那扇门能再打开一点，如果家庭医生能对此了解更多，那么它将释放我们医疗系统中大量的空间，因为我们有三年的等待名单才能见到可以进行评估的精神病学家。所以我的意思是，就像其他一切一样，我们只是需要更多的医生和更多的培训。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Well, I'm the last I when I last looked into it, I think doctors, family doctors study ADHD for like half a day in their training. And so they and and they're not getting trained on what it looks like in women or even adult men quite frankly. Um, and I know when I first reached out to my family doctor about it, she said, "I'm so sorry. I just don't know enough about it to give you an assessment." And so I think that if that door could open a little bit more if family doctors were more informed about it, then it would it would free up so much space in in our health care system because we have like three-year weight list to get in to see psychiatrists who could do the assessment. So I mean like everything else, we just need more doctors and more training.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么您对那些可能认为自己的孩子不够努力，或者，您知道，可能认为他们患有ADHD的父母说些什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And and what do you say to parents who maybe think that their child isn't trying hard enough or, you know, uh or maybe they think that they have ADHD?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。嗯，我的意思是，是的，在系统中导航很困难，但如果您确实认为您的孩子患有ADHD，我认为您需要成为他们的倡导者。就像您会成为那样，对吧？所以您需要找到一种方法，或者去找不同的医生并研究，弄清楚。这基本上就是我们医疗系统目前的情况，就像您需要成为一名研究人员。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. Um well, I mean, yeah, in the system it it's hard to navigate, but if you do think your child has ADHD, I think you need to be their advocate. Like that's what you become, right? So you need to find a way or find go to different doctors and research and figure it out. That's basically what our health care system has come to at this point is just like you need to become a researcher.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 最后，在学校里，因为我认为这是问题真正被放大的地方。是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And finally in schools cuz I think this is where this is really magnified. Yes.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我认为老师是英雄，而且在安大略省公立学校系统中有孩子的经历告诉我，他们正在尽其所能。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Um I think teachers are heroes and um having a child in the Ontario public school system they're doing what they can with what they have.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 绝对是。但是，当他们寻找可能需要额外支持的孩子时，他们有某些指标。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Absolutely. Um, but they have certain markers when they're looking for children who might need additional supports.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但当涉及到女孩时，她们可能并不总是具备那些被认为是指标的东西。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But when it comes to girls, they might not always have what is perceived to be those markers.

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 有时女孩因为在很小的时候就非常擅长**伪装**，所以她们没有被识别出来。所以老师们不一定是因为他们不想或不在乎而错过她们，而是因为女孩们非常擅长假装。所以，确实需要一位非常敏锐的老师才能注意到女孩们身上发生了什么，但迹象是存在的，对吧？比如有白日梦、烦躁不安、坐立不安、话很多，就像一个话匣子，还有健忘。您知道，有一些迹象可以将患有ADHD的小女孩与其他人群区分开来，但您必须注意到它们。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Sometimes girls because they become so good at masking at such a young age, um, they don't get identified. So the teachers aren't aren't aren't missing them necessarily because they want they they don't care, but because girls are so good at pretending. So, it does take a really astute teacher to notice what's going on with girls, but the signs are there, right? Like there's daydreaming, there's like um jittery like fidgeting, there's talking a lot, like just being a a chatterbox um and like forgetting things. And you know, there there are signs that set little girls with ADHD apart from the population, but you just have to notice them

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 并且知道那是什么，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: and know what it what it is, right?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 是的。而且还要知道该怎么做，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Carla Chiconei**: Yeah. And know what to do about it, too, right?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我还有什么想和您谈的，但我没有问到的吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um is there anything that I you wanted to talk about that I didn't ask you?

</details>

**Carla Chiconei**: 我不认为有。是的。非常感谢您。
<details>
