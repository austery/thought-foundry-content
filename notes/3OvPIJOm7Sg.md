### 财报发布前的期待与市场预测

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Robinhood 财报解读。这是2025年第三季度的财报分析。非常高兴能和大家在这里相聚。与我同行的两位朋友 Roy 和 Tanner，在过去几年里一直与我并肩作战，能和朋友们一起经历这段旅程，我感到非常有意义。你们好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another edition of Robin Hood Earnings. This is Q3 2025. Very excited to be here with everybody. I'm here with two people that have been on the journey with me over the past couple years and it has been very rewarding to be on this journey with friends Roy and Tanner. How you guys doing?</p>
</details>

我状态很好，很兴奋。这是我持仓最重的股票，但无论结果如何我都不担心。这是一家卓越的公司，执行力惊人，股价也涨了很多。我们都知道财报会很好，问题在于到底有多好，以及市场会作何反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Doing great. Yeah, I'm excited. my largest position. Not worried either way. Amazing company, amazing execution. Stock is way up. Um, we know it's going to be good. The question is how good and how will the market react. So,</p>
</details>

是的，我真的非常激动，不仅想看 Hood 会交出怎样的成绩单，还很期待这次的问答环节，我认为会非常有趣。他们正在进入许多新市场，比如信用卡、预测市场、银行业务。我认为他们对这些问题的回答可能会对股价产生实质性的推动作用。除此之外，今天还有很多其他令人兴奋的公司发布财报。我们当然会重点关注 Hood 的电话会议并提出一些问题，但总的来说，今天将会是信息量非常大的一天，应该会很精彩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, dude. I I'm really freaking excited uh to see not only what Hood is going to put up, but a lot of the Q&A this time around, I also think is going to be really interesting. They're entering so many new markets this time around. credit cards, prediction markets, banking, they can really uh answer things in ways that I think could be um you know material to push the stock. Aside from that, there's actually a lot of other companies that are pretty exciting that are also reporting today. I think we'll be listening into the hood call and and having a couple questions there. But, uh today in general is going to be a very jam-packed day. So, so should be exciting.</p>
</details>

没错。今天不仅有 Hood，还有 Duolingo、Applovin、Qualcomm、NQ、Elf、Fortinet、DoorDash、Joby、Lyft、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Centric Energy、Anovix、Honest、Figma，可能还有一些我漏掉的。我们将在4:05拿到 Hood 的业绩，然后花大约20到25分钟分析和解读。之后我们会尽快覆盖其他所有股票。上次我们这样做的时候，同时有 Hood、微软和 Meta 的财报，那次也是两个巨头。但如果你持有其他公司的股票，我们会在分析完 Hood 后立即跟进。如果市场有大的波动，我们可能会在中间插播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, not only do we have Hood, we have Dualingo, Apploving, Qualcomm, NQ, Elf, Forinet, Door Dash, Joby, Lyft, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, Centric, Energy, Anovix, Honest, Figma, and probably a couple others that I'm missing. So, we're going to get the results on Hood at 405. Uh, we're going to try to analyze the results at least for about 20 25 minutes and kind of break them down and then we're going to get to pretty much every other stock. Last time we did this, we had Hood, Microsoft, and Meta. So, those were two big names to pay attention to. But if you're in any of the other names, we will try to get the coverage immediately right after we get Hood. If there's like a big mover up or down, uh we'll probably call it out in the middle of it. But we are going to see if we can get that Hood coverage.</p>
</details>

### 关键数据前瞻与潜在惊喜

目前，市场普遍预期 Robinhood 的营收为12.2亿美元。有些分析师预测是12亿，有些是12.2亿。所以具体预期数字可能有些模糊，上次也出现了类似情况。但无论如何，预期已经上调了，最初是10.1亿，现在增加了约2亿美元。每股收益（EPS）预期为54美分。我会在聊天区发起一个“看涨或看跌”的投票。很明显，在财报发布前，股价已经上涨了约5%。Tanner，我们先从你开始，你认为股价会怎么走？你觉得他们会在营收和利润上都超出预期吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the street is expecting 1.22 billion in revenue. Some analysts have 1.2, others have 1.22. So, might be a little, this happened last time, a little bit of confusion on exactly what the expected revenue number is, but it has gone up. Originally, it was 1.01. So, it's gone up by about 200 million and 54 cents of EPS. I'm going to do the pump or dump poll in the chat. Obviously, the stock is moving going into the print, up about 5%. Uh, Tanner, we'll start with you. What do you think happens to the stock? And do you think they beat on the top and the bottom line?</p>
</details>

我的预测是12亿美元营收，略低于华尔街的预期。同时，我的每股收益预测是55美分。我的预测比较保守，因为有些因素我没有完全计入。所以最终可能与华尔街的预期基本一致。我之所以预测得如此接近，是因为对于这只股票，我们需要猜测的部分很少。除了大约三个交易日，我们已经掌握了过去三个月的所有交易量数据。因此，市场共识会非常集中。我们唯一不确定的是业务的**抽成率**（Take rate: 交易平台从每笔交易中抽取的佣金或费用比例）以及其他一些小细节，比如**事件合约**（Event Contracts: 也称为预测市场，允许用户对未来事件的结果进行交易的金融工具）的收入。但即便如此，他们也已经披露了第三季度交易了20亿份期权合约等细节。所以我也不确定，希望能有大的惊喜，比如 Bitstamp 或者信用卡的交易量超出预期。但在季度报告发布前就公布了所有信息，确实很难有太大的意外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have uh $1.2 billion, which is just slight of what Wall Street's expecting. And then I also have which is also conservative. There's a couple things that I don't have baked in. So, I might be right in line with Wall Street there. And I've got 55 cents of EPS. Now, the reason why I'm so close to Wall Street is because there's very little guessing that we have to do on this name. I mean, we've seen all of the volume that they've seen over the past 3 months, aside from like three trading days. So, this is why consensus is going to be very tight. The only thing that we don't know is the take rate on the business and and other small things like event contracts and what that means. But um even then they've shown us details of you know two billion options contracts traded during uh Q3 and you know all this different details. So I don't know man I'm I'm hopeful that they just come out with a large surprise and beat earnings. Maybe Bitstamp maybe uh credit card seeing more transactions than people expect. But it's very hard to surprise on this name whenever you give all of your information before the quarter is even released.</p>
</details>

同意。Roy，你对股价的反应有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Agreed. Roy, your thoughts on uh how you think the stock will react?</p>
</details>

考虑到股价近期涨幅很大，如果出现回调我不会感到意外。今天市场整体表现稍好，但仍存在一些疲软迹象。对于涨幅巨大的股票，即使财报非常好，也常常会出现抛售。过去几周我们已经看到了这种情况。如果真的发生回调，虽然这是我最大的持仓，但我心态很平稳。我对公司的执行力非常满意。正如 Tanner 所说，业绩超预期的空间不大，但我想反驳一点：你说的“事件合约”之类的小事，在 Robinhood 的发展叙事中，预测市场绝不是小事。我认为这将是本季度的重中之重。其他可能的惊喜可能来自股票借贷业务，上次我们就看到了巨大的惊喜。当然还有新的收购，你提到了 Bitstamp，还有 Trade PMR。此外，保证金利率我们只知道前两个月的数据，那两个月的数据简直是惊人的。最后还有国际扩张。所以，一切皆有可能。虽然很多信息已知，我们知道业绩会很好，但问题是到底有多好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback just because we've been running hard. The markets doing a little bit better today, but there is some weakness on it and it tends to sell off even very good earnings for names that have risen a lot. Um we've seen that over the last couple of weeks. So, you know, if that happens, I mean, it's my largest position, but I'm sitting pretty. Um I'm I'm very happy and pleased with the execution. And there there is a you know like like Tanner said there's less opportunity for surprise on the upside but I I would push back on one thing you you said small things like event contracts uh predictions market is not a small thing especially in the narrative that is Robin Hood and so I think that that's going to be paramount uh this quarter additional surprises could also come from stock lending we saw a huge surprise they had some commentary on it last time of course the uh the new acquisitions you mentioned bitstamp but also trade PMR uh margin rates we don't know those for the previous month. We do for the first two and they were absolutely ridiculous. And of course, international expansion. So, um, anything can happen. A lot's known. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good.</p>
</details>

我之所以说它“小”，是因为我们甚至已经看到了第三季度交易了多少合约。大概是20亿份合约，粗略计算下来大约是2000万美元的收入，这只占我们预估总营收的1%左右。我当然期望它能增长，我只是说在本季度，它还不会构成实质性影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the only reason why I said small is because I think we even seen how many contracts were traded in Q3. It was something like, you know, uh, 2 billion contracts, whatever, which roughly comes out to $20 million. That's roughly like 1% of the revenue of what we're expecting. So like I am expecting them to grow. I just mean in this quarter it's not going to be that material. That's all.</p>
</details>

是的，我的看法是市场是向前看的。你会发现，大部分问题，甚至我们自己的一些问题，可能都会集中在预测市场上。这是一个正在迅速加速的、强劲的未来增长驱动力。我认为这很可能会成为推动未来股价的重要因素，当然这取决于他们如何报告以及他们会说些什么。他们也可能发布十月份的数据，我们以前见过他们这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and my thought is just the market's forwardlooking and you'll see I think we'll see most questions maybe even some of our questions too on uh the predictions market. That's that's a future a strong future growth driver that's accelerating rapidly. Um and I think that's probably depending on of course how they report that and what they say as far as of course they also might release October numbers too. uh we've seen them do that before, but uh that's going to be a big part of what drives I think the stock in the future.</p>
</details>

### 市场背景与股价回顾

期权市场隐含的股价波动率为7%。我认为这个隐含波动率是在今天股价上涨5%之前计算的，这也正是财报季有时像一场赌博的原因，你永远不知道结果会如何。其他一些股票的隐含波动率：Applovin 10%，ARM 7%，DoorDash 8%，Snapchat 13%，ONQ 9.3%，Figma 作为上市公司发布的第二份财报，隐含波动率也是13%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the implied move is 7%. Uh now that implied move, I think was before the 5% move today, which is, you know, it's what makes earnings such a gamble sometimes because you just never know how it's going to play out. Nvidia kind of getting a dump right here into the close. Applovin has a 10% move. ARM 7%, Door Dash 8%, Snapchat 13%, ONQ 9.3, and then Figma uh as their second quarter as a public company. That is also a 13% move.</p>
</details>

在临近收盘时，英伟达股价下跌，特斯拉在明天股东投票前实际上是上涨的。标普500指数一度触及680.8点，现在是678点，所以对标普来说今天不算糟糕。SoFi 上涨2%，AMD 上涨3%，而 Robinhood 在这里上涨了5.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia right there going down. Tesla actually up going into the shareholder vote tomorrow. S&P 500 did hit 680.8 right now. We're at 678. So, not a horrible day for the S&P. SoFi is up 2%. AMD is up 3%. And then Robin right here up 5 and a half% as we are getting into a pound right there down about 1.5. Then Reddit up 0.2.</p>
</details>

在进入财报分析之前，还有一点很重要，需要给大家一些背景信息。Robinhood 的股价在2023年12月时仅为7美元，现在是144美元。它是整个标普500指数中表现最好的股票，因为它在两个月前被纳入了该指数。所以，恭喜所有股东。看，即使股价下跌10%，它也只是从上涨230%变成上涨220%或225%。到了这个地步，这些数字就变得有点……好吧，它显然涨了很多。对于我们这些重仓的人来说，下跌当然会实质性地影响投资组合，但我们不能不心存感激。我只想看到公司继续执行其战略。只要他们执行得好，我认为长期股东就会得到回报。如果你是在投机财报，你必须记住，很多公司公布了非常好的数据，但很多利好已经被市场消化，这意味着股价的走势未必如你所愿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the other important thing to understand uh as we get into this earnings um and just always to put some context into it, Robin Hood was $7 back in December of 2023. It is now 144. It is the best performing stock in the entire S&P 500 because they got in to the S&P 500 two months ago. So, uh congratulations to all shareholders on them getting into the S&P 500 as well. So, look, if the stock does take a dip and it goes down 10%, instead of being up 230%, it's up 225% or 220%. Like it's it's at at this point the numbers become kind of just like okay it's up a lot obviously and it's going to hurt materially portfolios that are have big positions to it like a lot of us do but it's not something we can't be grateful for. So I just want to see the company execute. As long as they execute I think long-term shareholders will be rewarded. If you are speculating on earnings you just got to remember we've had a lot of companies give really good numbers but a lot of it was priced in and that means the the earnings don't necessarily turn out the way you want in terms of stock price action.</p>
</details>

是的，我们三个人都关注的是公司的长期愿景。除非他们公布负面数据，否则任何积极的进展都会有助于公司的长期发展，比如看到更多用户更频繁地交易，增加他们在 Robinhood 平台上的总钱包份额。从我最近看到的一切来看，比如 Vlad Tenev 与特斯拉社区和 Open Door 社区的互动，他们只在激励和吸引更多人加入平台。老实说，我认为这很有效。所以我认为第三季度会很好。至于第四季度，除了交易量可能下降之外，我实际上认为 Robinhood 在市场份额增长方面会有超常表现。但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the the long-term vision of the company is what I think all three of us are focused on. And unless they show negative numbers, it's going to help out the long-term vision of this company, seeing more members that are transacting more often, that are increasing their total share of wallet on Robin Hood. And from everything I'm seeing lately, like with Vlad Tennv's interaction with the Tesla community and the Open Door community, they only are incentivizing and wanting people more to come onto that platform. And I honestly think it's working. So I I think Q3 is going to be good. I think Q4, aside from the lack of trading volume that might end up showing up, I actually think Robin Hood will see an outsized amount of market share growth in Q4 as well. But we'll see.</p>
</details>

是的，这是他们最后一个相对轻松的比较基期了。第四季度的比较会更困难。我认为他们会没问题，但挑战确实会越来越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this this is the last pretty easy comp that they have. Q4 will be harder. Um I think they'll be fine, but uh it does get more challenging beyond this.</p>
</details>

### 新产品线的增长动力

我认为进入财报季，另一个重要的事情是这些新产品的发展轨迹。正如 Roy 和 Tanner 提到的，预测市场是一件大事。我想每个人都开始意识到，预测市场已经成为任何大型事件文化的一部分，无论是纽约市长选举还是体育赛事。作为一个有潜力发展成十亿美元业务的产品，我认为管理层对此的讨论将非常重要。信用卡业务现在已经有大约45万用户，候补名单上超过三百万人。所以整个银行业务生态系统都很重要。我们九月份刚刚参加了 Hood 峰会，见到了很多朋友。Cortex AI、Robin Hood Social……我的意思是，他们为2026年准备了很多不同的垂直领域可以开拓。所以，我也很好奇他们会如何谈论最新产品的增长，比如期货、指数期权，以及他们今年推出的所有超过15种不同的产品。然后，这些将如何影响2026年的发展，无论市场是超级牛市、平稳市还是熊市。他们如何为公司的未来定位？我认为这是很多人会关心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think uh the other thing that's important going into earnings is um the trajectory of these new products. So, as Roy and Tanner were talking about, prediction markets is a big deal. I think everyone is starting to realize that prediction markets are part of the culture of just any big event, whether it's the New York mayor election or uh sports events. So that as a as a product that can grow into a billion dollar business one day. I think that's going to be really important for management to talk about. Credit card now is like 450,000 people. Uh I think over three million people on the wait list. So the whole banking ecosystem that's important. We just had hood summit in September. All of us got to go meet a bunch of you guys there. Uh Cortex AI, Robin Hood social. I mean there's a lot of different verticals I think they have ready to tap into for 2026. So, I would also be curious to see how they talk about the growth that of their latest products, futures, index options, all the different things they ship this year, which I think is well over 15 different products. And then how that bleeds into what's going to happen in 26 regardless of if it's a Super Bowl market or if it's, you know, casual or even if it's a bare market. How do they position the company going forward in the future? And I think that's what a lot of people will care about.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与英伟达的意外下跌

不确定为什么英伟达股价在下跌。在今天收盘时，它受到了冲击。哇，英伟达下跌了2%。我没有看到任何相关新闻。Tanner，你知道原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not sure why Nvidia is going down. It is getting hit right here as we get into the end of the day. Wow. One 2% down on Nvidia. I don't see any headline. Tanner, do you know?</p>
</details>

不，我没有关注。我仍然觉得……当崩盘发生时，我还在想“哦不，195了”。这就是问题所在，对吧？这只股票在过去三周一直停留在170美元，现在我们却因为它从200美元跌到195美元而生气。现在正值年底，我们都想在最后两个月里冲刺一下最终的业绩数字，但即使这些股票没有以历史新高收官，也不是什么可怕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh no. No, I have not been following. I I still like while the crash is happening I'm like oh no 195. Yeah, this is the thing, right? It's like this thing was stuck at 170 for the past three weeks and now we're mad it's from 200 to 195. It's just like it's that part of the end of the year where we're trying to get those final numbers in the last two months, but it's okay if these names don't end at alltime highs. It's not a horrible thing.</p>
</details>

我不太清楚英伟达今天下跌的具体原因，但我知道在 Palantir 公布财报后，有很多头条新闻说人工智能可能被过度炒作了，Palantir 因此下跌等等，尽管他们有一个非常棒的季度。我看到这种情绪也传导到了其他几家人工智能公司，包括英伟达。不过，这只是跌回了一周前的水平而已。所以，哦不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I I don't know exactly why Nvidia is falling today, but I I know with Palunteer uh afterwards there was a lot of headlines like that maybe AI is overhyped and Palanteer is falling as a result and everything because they had an amazing quarter and and I've seen that translate to several other A&Ms including uh Nvidia which I mean it's like levels not seen since like a week ago. So Oh no.</p>
</details>

当一只股票上涨时，它下跌的原因可能和上涨的原因一样随意。最终，我们都得接受这个事实。这里有一条关于谷歌的重要新闻，来自彭博社：苹果正在敲定一项协议，每年向谷歌支付约10亿美元，将其1.2万亿参数的 Gemini AI 模型整合到 Siri 中。这将是一件大事。我们听到了很多关于苹果和谷歌合作的传闻。看起来苹果可能选择了 Gemini 而非 ChatGPT，来为 Siri 的扩展建立一个有意义的框架。这就是为什么谷歌股价略有上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's the thing about when a stock goes up, it's like, well, when it goes down, even if it was probably going up for whatever reason, it will go down for whatever reason. And ultimately, we have to digest that. There was a headline with Google right here that was really important. Uh, this is from Bloomberg. Apple is finalizing a deal to pay Google about 1 billion a year to integrate its 1.2 trillion parameter Gemin Gemini AI model into Siri. That would be a pretty big deal. We've heard a lot of rumors about Apple and Google working together. It looks like Apple's potentially going with Gemini over Chat GBT to really establish a meaningful framework for Siri to expand and uh that's why Google stocks up a little bit. But it just further goes to show that this stock that was stuck at 150 for the majority of the year really ended up working out. Google right there 28.</p>
</details>

我看到一条推文：英伟达股价大跌，因有报道称主要云服务提供商正在缩减2025年的GPU订单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm seeing a tweet here. Nvidia tumbles after reports suggest major cloud providers are scaling back GPU orders for 2025.</p>
</details>

哦，是的。就是那个。那条彭博社的新闻。那确实会造成影响。那会是一条足够分量的新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. That that that exact thing. Okay. That's the Bloomberg. That That would do it. I mean, that would be enough of a headline.</p>
</details>

我们已经见过太多这样的报道了。微软缩减开支，谷歌缩减开支。我们都见过。除非我从这些公司口中亲耳听到，否则我不会相信。“消息人士称”已经成为路透社和彭博社报道的假新闻的最大来源。我不信。如果黄仁勋看到了发展路径……而且，现在是11月，谈论缩减2025年的GPU采购？我们在说什么？我们刚看到黄仁勋出来说未来六个季度有5000亿美元的市场空间。你觉得他们会说：“哦，你知道吗？我们现在就停止为11月和12月采购吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the thing. We've seen so many of these reports happen. Microsoft scaling back, you know, Google scaling back. We've seen all of this. Until I hear it from any of those companies mouths, I do not believe them. sources say has been the biggest source of fake news that has been reported on from Reuters and Bloomberg and all these I don't believe it. You know, if Jensen sees a pathway and by the way scaling back in 2020 or for GPU purchases in 2025, it's freaking November. What are we talking about? Like we've seen Jensen just come out and say there's $500 billion runway over the next six quarters. You think they're like, "Oh, you know what? Let's stop buying right now for November and December.</p>
</details>

是的，到目前为止，整个财报季都是英伟达的财报季，因为所有大型科技公司都在谈论他们的资本支出扩张，而不是收缩。所以我更相信那些公司的说法，而不是所谓的“消息来源”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And and like so far in the earning season, like all the entire earning season is Nvidia's earning season just because you have major uh large cap tech that talk about their capital X expansion, not retraction. Uh so I would put a lot more credence in that versus sources. Whoever the sources are.</p>

Duolingo 股价下跌。之前跌了5%，现在跌了3%，来回波动。但盘后确实受到了冲击。高通再次超出了EPS和营收预期。指引方面，他们预计3.30至3.50美元，市场预期为3.26美元，也超出了预期。营收指引为118.8亿至126亿美元，同样超出市场预期的115.9亿美元。这是在指引、EPS和营收上的四重胜利，相当不错。Hood 的数据出来了吗？还没有。应该在两分钟内。

It's like going back and forth as you can see that little green candle right there. But that one is getting hit after hours. Qualcomm again, they did beat EPS. They did beat revenue. Uh guidance, they're doing 330 to 350 estimates was 326. That's also a beat. And uh revenue 11.8 8 to 12.6. That's also a beat. Street wanted at 11.59. That's a that's a quadruple beat across the board on guidance, EPS, and revenue, which is not too bad. Hood, do we have it yet? Do we have it? Not yet. Should be in two minutes. We get Hood.</p>

我拿到数据了。每股收益61美分，营收12.7亿美元。他们实现了双重超越！

<p class="english-text">Okay, I got the numbers. uh 61 cents of EPS, 1.27 billion. They double beat.</p>

太棒了！我不知道他们是怎么做到的。股价可以随心所欲地波动，但天哪，这业绩太惊人了。营收环比增长29%。我们原以为他们能达到12亿就很困难了，结果是12.74亿。我的天！

</details>

当你看到这样的数字时，你必须超越股价的短期波动，然后感叹：天哪，61美分的EPS意味着他们的**经营杠杆**（Operating Leverage: 指在企业生产经营中由于存在固定成本而导致息税前利润变动率大于业务量变动率的现象）可能在这个季度变得更好了，这已经是连续第八个季度了。

我这里有份报道：Robinhood 公布每股收益61美分，高于分析师预期的53美分；营收12.7亿美元，高于预期的11.9亿美元。基于交易的营收略低于预期，为7.3亿美元，尽管股票和期权交易量创下纪录。但这一不足被净利息收入的强劲增长所抵消。入金账户数也略低于预期，为2688万。与此同时，高管层发生变动，新任CFO Shiv Verma将接替Jason Warnick。我刚刚和他们俩都谈过，他们都指出预测市场是一个主要的亮点。

<details>

Now funded accounts also a slight miss at 26.8 8 million. Meanwhile, a seauite shakeup. New CFO Shiv Verma is taking over for Jason Warick. I spoke to them both moments ago. They pointed to prediction markets as a major.</p>

这可能是股价下跌的原因。市场很喜欢 Jason Warnick。他卸任本身不是坏事，但无论他出于何种原因卸任，每当有高管变动时，我们总会看到市场的膝跳反应。

</details>

报道称预测市场是他们有史以来增长最快的业务。第三季度的合约交易量比第二季度翻了一番。仅在十月份，他们的交易量就超过了整个上一季度。他们表示，进入第四季度，势头强劲，客户存款和活动均创下历史新高。

### 深度解读财报亮点：增长、盈利与未来布局

好了，我来解读一下这份财报。营收同比增长100%，达到12.7亿美元。净存款创下200亿美元的纪录。天哪，他们有史以来最多的一次好像是130亿。净存款增加了70亿。Robinhood Gold 订阅用户数创下390万的纪录。每股收益61美分。Robinhood 现在有11条业务线年化收入超过1亿美元。

Robin and now to 11 business lines generating 100 more million or more in annualized revenues.</p>
</details>

Vlad 表示：“我们团队不懈的产品迭代速度在第三季度推动了创纪录的业务成果，而且我们没有放慢脚步。预测市场正在迅速增长，Robinhood 银行服务开始推出，Robinhood Ventures 也即将到来。” Jason 补充道：“第三季度是又一个实现盈利性增长的强劲季度，我们继续多元化业务，新增了预测市场和 Bitstamp 两条年化收入约1亿美元或以上的业务线。第四季度开局强劲，十月份的股票、期权、预测市场和期货的月度交易量均创下历史新高，保证金余额也创下新高。”

<p class="english-text">Here we go. Our team's relentless product velocity drove record business results in Q3 and we're not slowing down. Prediction markets growing rapidly. Robin Banking is starting to roll out and Robin Adventures is coming, said Vlad. Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth and we continue to diversify our business adding two or more business lines, prediction markets in Bitstamp that are generating approximately 100 million or more in annualized revenues. And Q4 is off to a strong start in October with record monthly trading volumes across equities, options, prediction markets, and futures and new highs for margin balances.</p>
</details>

具体数据：净营收12.7亿美元，其中交易收入7.3亿，净利息收入4.56亿，其他收入8800万。净利润5.56亿美元。所以12.7亿营收中有5.56亿是纯利润。入金客户2680万，管理资产3330亿美元。净存款204亿美元，这个数字简直不可思议。**ARPU**（Average Revenue Per User: 每用户平均收入）达到191美元。Gold 订阅用户总数390万，增加了近200万。他们持有43亿美元现金。公司以104美元的均价回购了100万股股票，花费了1.07亿美元。

<p class="english-text">Uh net revenues again 1.27 billion. Transaction 730. Net interest 456. I think that's their highest ever or close to their highest. Other revenues 88 million.

Again, that is just incredible. Arpoo is at 191 a user. Gold subscribers up by almost 2 million, 3.9 million total. They have 4.3 billion in cash. They bought a million shares of their stock at a 104. So, they spent 107 million buying their stock. Um, and so you had about a million shares with the share buybacks.</p>
</details>

十月份的净存款为55亿美元，保证金余额增长150%至160亿美元，这与我们从**FINRA**（Financial Industry Regulatory Authority: 美国金融业监管局）听到的情况类似，即所有券商的保证金贷款都处于历史最高水平。十月份的股票交易量达到3200亿美元，我从没见过单月有这么高的数字。期权合约交易量2.6亿份，之前最多好像是1.95亿份。加密货币交易量320亿美元，而十月份的加密市场行情并不好。这太惊人了。

CFO Jason Warnick 宣布计划明年退休。他将在第一季度过渡 CFO 角色，并担任战略顾问。这可能是股价下跌的原因，仅仅因为 CFO 要退休了。Roy，你对这些数字的初步看法是什么？

<p class="english-text">Okay, that's what you got. A CFO Jason Warick announces intention to retire next year. Jason will transition from his role as CFO in Q1 and be a strategic adviser. That could be why the stock is dumping just that the CFO is retiring. But that's what you got. Uh Roy, your kind of raw thoughts on these numbers.</p>
</details>

简直是荒谬的好。分析师和我们自己的预期都很高，但他们仍然超越了。这是一家在基本面上执行力极强的公司，所有业务都在全速前进。他们还有很多未来的增长杠杆。我同意你的看法，股价可能已经消化了很多利好，被定价到完美。但当一家公司的CFO离职时，股价出现下跌并不罕见。我甚至觉得这种情况比CEO离职更常见，因为CFO是一个关键角色，有时人们会想：“哦，他要走了，肯定是有什么非常糟糕的事情要发生了。” 我不认为Robinhood是这种情况。我认为这一直是计划的一部分。Jason非常出色，我祝愿他未来一切顺利。这是一个非常有才华的团队，所以我对此没有担忧。

<p class="english-text">I mean, yeah, ridiculous. Uh we expectations were high from analysts and also from us and they they still beat it.

I I've actually seen that more often than when the CEO leaves just because CFO is a critical role and sometimes which will not be the case for Robin Hood. There's people like, "Oh, they're leaving so it must be something that's really bad that's out there." Well, I don't think that's the case. I think this has been the plan. Jason's amazing. Um, and I wish him well in whatever he has in the future. But, uh, yeah, it's a very talented group, so no concerns there.</p>

### 财报电话会议实录与管理层解读

（*以下为财报电话会议的节选与解读*）

**Vlad Tenev (CEO):** 大家好，很高兴和大家在这里相聚。第三季度又是一个产品迭代速度惊人的季度。我们的营收比去年翻了一番，创下历史新高。每股收益也增长了三倍多。我们在三大战略支柱上都取得了巨大进展：活跃交易者、钱包份额和全球金融生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everyone, I'm here in our offices getting ready for our Q3 2025 earnings call streaming live from the Chase Center in San Francisco. Here's a quick rundown. Q3 was another record quarter driven by our continued relentless product velocity. Revenues doubled from last year to a record high. EPS also more than tripled at the same time. And we made great progress across our three strategic pillars. First, for active traders, we set records for equity and options trading volumes in Q3.</p>
</details>

对于活跃交易者，我们在第三季度创下了股票和期权交易量的记录。保证金账户余额在过去18个月里增长了三倍，创下历史新高。我们的预测市场业务正在飞速发展，仅第三季度就交易了超过20亿份事件合约。不仅如此，十月份的交易量甚至更大，超过了整个第三季度的总和。我们正在将其打造成一个全面的产品，不仅服务于交易者，也成为全新的信息来源。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Margin account balances tripled over the past 18 months to a record high. And our prediction markets are ripping with over two billion event contracts traded in Q3 alone. Not only that, October was even bigger, bigger than all of Q3 combined. And we've added contracts for pro and college football, entertainment, politics, economics, technology, and so much more. This is really becoming a comprehensive offering, not just for traders, but also brand new source of information.</p>
</details>

在钱包份额方面，我们希望成为您的主要和次要金融账户。平台总资产现已超过三千亿美元。客户非常喜欢我们的长期投资产品，Robinhood Retirement 和 Robinhood Strategies 都在稳步增长。此外，我们正在迅速向更多客户发放金卡，并已开始推出 Robinhood Banking。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Second, on the wallet share front, we want to be your primary and secondary financial account, and we're making a lot of progress. We're seeing strong momentum in total platform assets with a third of a trillion dollars now held at Robin Hood. Customers are loving our long-term investing products, both Robin Hood Retirement and Robin Hood Strategies ramping up super nicely. Plus, we're rapidly shipping gold cards to more customers, and we've begun the roll out for Robin Hood banking as well.</p>
</details>

最后，我们正在全球扩张，构建全球第一的金融生态系统。代币化极大地推动了我们的全球扩张。我们还通过 Robinhood Ventures 为散户股东提供接触私营公司的机会。未来还有更多值得期待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, last but not least, we're expanding globally as we build the number one global financial ecosystem. Tokenization has been a big accelerant to our global expansion. And you might see in this chalkboard here from our European event in Europe. We're continuing to execute on our roadmap and we more than doubled the number of stock tokens available to our customers. We also rolled out perpetual futures and in the US we're excited to bring access to private companies to retail shareholders through Robin Hood Ventures. Plenty more to come there.</p>

### 盘后总结：一次“载入史册”的财报

Hood 的股价回到了140美元以上。我真的认为最初的下跌与CFO离职有关。每当市场熟知的高管卸任时，都会被立即解读为坏消息，但事实可能只是他个人生活进入了新阶段。但我想这就是最初下跌的原因。我的意思是，聊天室里有谁能告诉我，除了市场本身的原因，这只股票在公布如此亮眼的数字后有什么理由下跌吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hood is back over 140. I think I I really do think that initial decline had to do with the CFO leaving. Uh every time a seauite that the street knows about is stepping down, it immediately interpreted as bad and the dude might just be moving on to a different point of his life. Um but I think that's why you had the initial I mean dude I I mean can anyone in the chat tell me a reason this stock should even kind of be down after these numbers outside of just the market being the market?</p>
</details>

百分之百同意。我们作为非常看好的投资者，对这只股票抱有很高的期望。而这次财报再次超出了我们所有人的预期。当你能够持续地、一个季度接一个季度地做到这一点时，你就理应比同行业的其他公司获得更高的估值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100%. We come in as very bullish investors with high expectations for this name. Uh this beat I think all of our expectations once again. And whenever you do that constantly quarter after quarter after quarter that's why it deserves a higher multiple than other companies in their you know sector.</p>
</details>

没错。如果一家公司已经持续多年证明他们能够超越预期，而且不是小幅超越，是大幅超越，那么你就必须给予他们溢价。有时候支付这个溢价是值得的，因为你正在购买一家划时代的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. And and if a company has given you constant at this point years of proving they can beat expectations and not just beat them but really beat them, that's where you got to just, you know, give them a premium and it is okay sometimes to pay that premium because you're buying a generational company.</p>
</details>

幻灯片第18页显示，他们有11条业务线的年化收入达到或超过1亿美元。本季度，他们新增了预测市场和Bitstamp。从2019年至今，已有的业务线包括证券借贷、黄金订阅、即时提款、现金管理、加密货币保证金、利息收入、股票交易和期权交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Slide 18 is showing 11 lines of businesses doing 100 million or more. So this quarter they added prediction markets at Bitstamp. They have securities lending, gold subscription, instant withdrawals, cashew margin, crypto margin, interest, equities trading, and options trading over the course of 2019.</p>
</details>

而且他们还在回购股票。我从未见过一家公司能以这样的速度增长，拥有如此高的经营杠杆，同时还能向股东返还资金。通常只有那些大型的、传统的“老牌”公司才会回购股票。而 Robinhood 正处于其增长的拐点，他们却在回购自己的股票，这显示了他们资产负债表的灵活性有多强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they're buying back shares like like I have not seen a company before that can grow at this level, have this type of operating leverage and give money back to shareholders at this you're supposed to buy back shares when you're like a big old D like legacy company, right? The Robin Hood is is is in the inflection of its growth and they are actually buying back their stock which goes to show how much flexibility they have with their balance sheet which is another I could also add for some reason they or somehow I don't know but whenever they go to buy back shares it's always at such an amazing price for the quarter like they just know what the bottom is before we do.</p>
</details>

是的，他们以104美元的价格回购，那可能正是在被纳入标普500指数之前，指数的纳入推动股价远高于104美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, dude. They got it at 104. I mean, that's that's right that's probably right before the S&P 500 run also took it uh much higher than 104.</p>
</details>

**Vlad Tenev (CEO 在财报电话会议上):** 我认为大家应该知道，我们没有放慢脚步。团队对继续我们的使命充满热情，还有很多事情要做。我们的路线图排得满满的。即将举行的AI活动将非常激动人心，希望你们中的一些人能够加入我们，至少是线上参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I I think you guys should know that we are not slowing down. Uh the team remains incredibly excited to continue our mission and there's so much to do. Roadmap is full. Uh AI event is coming up which I think will be very very exciting. So hopefully some of you will be able to join us there uh at least virtually.</p>
</details>

**主持人总结:** 这是一次荒谬而惊人的季度财报。你很难找到弱点，必须非常仔细地寻找。这家公司仍然具有周期性，但他们在所有方面都执行得非常出色。就像 Vlad 在结束语中所说，这不仅仅是夸夸其谈。如果我们没有看到他们的执行力，那或许是。但这是一家以极高节奏和卓越水平执行的公司。他们进行的收购……他们做的每件事都恰到好处。Amit，你说得对，这是一家未来市值将达到万亿美元的公司。可能需要10年才能实现，但也可能不用那么久。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, just a ridiculous amazing quarter. Uh, and just it's hard to find weak spots. Like, you have to really look. Uh, this company is cyclical still, but they're executing on all cylinders. and like Vlad said, like those end comments, it's not just hyperbole. If, if we had not seen the execution, maybe it would be, but this is a company that executes at an incredibly high cadence uh, and with excellence and they do acquisitions like they're just doing like everything right. This is emit, you're right, it is a$1 trillion dollar company in the future. It may take 10 years to get there, but maybe not.</p>
</details>

是的。看，如果我们2026年遇到熊市或者市场回调——市场不可避免地会有某种程度的回调——这只股票绝对在必买清单的首位。就是这样。每当你考虑卖出或减持仓位时，然后你听到这样的电话会议，忘了那些业绩数字，你只听管理层谈论业务发展轨迹的质量，这会提醒你几件事。第一，创业是艰难的。第二，扩大和发展业务更难。第三，它提醒你世界上能以90%或100%（对Robinhood而言）年增长率扩张的公司是多么稀少。可能只有二三十家上市公司能做到。因此，它就在顶级名单上。关于这个管理团队，有一点是你可以信任他们。你真的可以信任他们。这对我来说是最重要的组成部分之一。你能信任管理层吗？我认为我们真的可以信任Vlad和他们的执行方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, look, if we get a bearish market in 26 or we get a correction, which inevitably you have some type of pullback in the market, this is like it's on the top list of stocks to buy. It just is. I mean, it's like, you know, and whenever you think of selling or trimming the position, and everyone can sell or trim or do whatever they need to do for for personal reasons, and then you hear a call like this, forget the results. You just hear the quality of how management is talking about the trajectory of a business. It reminds you a couple things. Number one, it reminds you that building a business is hard. And anyone who's ever built a business knows how hard it is. It reminds you that scaling and growing the business is even harder. You can make a business, but then actually getting it to compound over years is is very difficult. And then number three, it reminds you how few businesses that are out there in the world that are actually scaling at 90% or 100% I should say for Robin Hood. year-over-year. Now, that's not going to happen forever, but the point is you really ask yourself, where are those companies? And there's not many of them. There's maybe 20 to 30 of them that are public. And as a result, it's on the top list. And you know, the one thing about this management team is you can trust them. You really can trust them. That's one of the biggest components for me. Can you trust management? I think we can really trust Vlad and and how they're executing.</p>
