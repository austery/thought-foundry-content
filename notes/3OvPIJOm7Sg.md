title: Robinhood 2025年Q3财报解析：业绩全面超预期，CFO宣布退休引发市场波动
summary: Robinhood 公布了其2025年第三季度财报，业绩表现极其亮眼，营收和每股收益均远超市场预期，同比增长近100%。财报显示，公司在预测市场、净存款、黄金会员订阅等多项业务上创下历史新高，展现出强大的增长动力和运营杠杆。然而，在财报发布的同时，公司宣布其备受尊敬的首席财务官 Jason Warick 将于明年退休，这一消息可能导致了股价在最初出现波动。尽管如此，公司的长期增长前景依然强劲。

### 财报前瞻：市场期待与分析师预测

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Robinhood 财报解读。这是 2025 年第三季度的财报，我很高兴能和大家一起讨论。今天和我一起的还有两位在过去几年里与我并肩作战的朋友，Roy 和 Tanner。和你们一起经历这段旅程真的收获满满。你们好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another edition of Robin Hood Earnings. This is Q3 2025. Very excited to be here with everybody. I'm here with two people that have been on the journey with me over the past couple years and it has been very rewarding to be on this journey with friends Roy and Tanner. How you guys doing?</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 我很好。是的，我很兴奋。这是我持仓最重的股票，但无论结果如何我都不担心。这是一家了不起的公司，执行力惊人，股价也涨了很多。我们都知道财报会很好，问题是到底有多好，以及市场会作何反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Doing great. Yeah, I'm excited. my largest position. Not worried either way. Amazing company, amazing execution. Stock is way up. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good and how will the market react.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 是的，兄弟。我真的非常兴奋，不仅想看 Hood 会交出怎样的成绩单，还觉得这次的问答环节会非常有趣。他们正在进入许多新市场：信用卡、**预测市场**（Prediction Markets: 允许用户对未来事件结果进行交易的市场）、银行业务。我认为他们可以用一些对股价有实质性推动作用的方式来回答问题。除此之外，今天还有很多其他令人兴奋的公司发布财报。我想我们会一边听 Hood 的电话会议，一边关注那边的几个问题。但总的来说，今天会是非常忙碌的一天，应该会很刺激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah. Yeah, dude. I I'm really freaking excited to see not only what Hood is going to put up, but a lot of the Q&A this time around, I also think is going to be really interesting. They're entering so many new markets this time around. credit cards, prediction markets, banking, they can really answer things in ways that I think could be material to push the stock. Aside from that, there's actually a lot of other companies that are pretty exciting that are also reporting today. I think we'll be listening into the hood call and and having a couple questions there. But, uh today in general is going to be a very jam-packed day. So, so should be exciting.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的。所以今天不仅有 Hood，还有 Duolingo、Applovin、Qualcomm、NQ、Elf、Fortinet、DoorDash、Joby、Lyft、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Centric Energy、Anovix、Honest、Figma，可能还有一些我漏掉的。我们会在 4:05 拿到 Hood 的业绩，然后花大约 20-25 分钟分析和解读。之后我们会尽快覆盖其他所有股票。上次我们这么做的时候，同时有 Hood、微软和 Meta 的财报，那可是两个需要密切关注的大公司。但如果你持有其他任何股票，我们也会在分析完 Hood 后立即跟进。如果有什么股票出现大幅上涨或下跌，我们可能会在直播中途就指出来。但我们还是会先确保完成对 Hood 的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, not only do we have Hood, we have Dualingo, Apploving, Qualcomm, NQ, Elf, Forinet, Door Dash, Joby, Lyft, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, Centric, Energy, Anovix, Honest, Figma, and probably a couple others that I'm missing. So, we're going to get the results on Hood at 405. Uh, we're going to try to analyze the results at least for about 20 25 minutes and kind of break them down and then we're going to get to pretty much every other stock. Last time we did this, we had Hood, Microsoft, and Meta. So, those were two big names to pay attention to. But if you're in any of the other names, we will try to get the coverage immediately right after we get Hood. If there's like a big mover up or down, uh we'll probably call it out in the middle of it. But we are going to see if we can get that Hood coverage.</p>
</details>

### 关键指标预测与潜在惊喜

目前，华尔街预计其营收为 12.2 亿美元。有些分析师预测是 12 亿，有些是 12.2 亿。所以具体预期营收数字可能有点混乱，上次也发生了类似情况，但预期值已经上调了。最初是 10.1 亿，所以已经上调了大约 2 亿美元，**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）预期为 54 美分。我会在聊天区发起一个“涨还是跌”的投票。很明显，在财报发布前，股价已经上涨了大约 5%。Tanner，我们从你开始。你认为股价会怎么走？你觉得他们会在营收和利润上都超出预期吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the street is expecting 1.22 billion in revenue. Some analysts have 1.2, others have 1.22. So, might be a little, this happened last time, a little bit of confusion on exactly what the expected revenue number is, but it has gone up. Originally, it was 1.01. So, it's gone up by about 200 million and 54 cents of EPS. I'm going to do the pump or dump poll in the chat. Obviously, the stock is moving going into the print, up about 5%. Uh, Tanner, we'll start with you. What do you think happens to the stock? And do you think they beat on the top and the bottom line?</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 我预测营收是 12 亿美元，略低于华尔街的预期。我的预测比较保守，有些因素没有考虑进去，所以最终可能和华尔街的预期差不多。我预测的 EPS 是 55 美分。我之所以预测得这么接近华尔街，是因为对于这只股票，我们几乎不需要猜测。除了大约三个交易日，我们已经看到了过去三个月的所有交易量。所以市场共识会非常集中。我们唯一不知道的是业务的**抽成率**（Take Rate: 指平台从每笔交易中收取的费用比例）以及其他一些小细节，比如事件合约（event contracts）的收入。但即便如此，他们已经向我们展示了细节，比如第三季度交易了 20 亿份期权合约等等。所以我不知道，我希望他们能带来一个巨大的惊喜，超出盈利预期。也许是 Bitstamp 的贡献，也许是信用卡的交易量超出了人们的预期。但当你把所有信息都在季度报告发布前公布出来时，就很难有惊喜了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I have uh $1.2 billion, which is just slight of what Wall Street's expecting. And then I also have which is also conservative. There's a couple things that I don't have baked in. So, I might be right in line with Wall Street there. And I've got 55 cents of EPS. Now, the reason why I'm so close to Wall Street is because there's very little guessing that we have to do on this name. I mean, we've seen all of the a lot of the volume that they've seen over the past 3 months, aside from like three trading days. So, this is why consensus is going to be very tight. The only thing that we don't know is the take rate on the business and and other small things like event contracts and what that means. But um even then they've shown us details of you know two billion options contracts traded during uh Q3 and you know all this different details. So I don't know man I'm I'm hopeful that they just come out with a large surprise and beat earnings. Maybe Bitstamp maybe uh credit card seeing more transactions than people expect. But it's very hard to surprise on this name whenever you give all of your information before the quarter is even released.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 同意。Roy，你对股价的反应有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Agreed. Roy, your thoughts on uh how you think the stock will react?</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 我不会对股价回调感到惊讶，因为它已经涨了很多。今天市场表现好一些，但还是有些疲软，而且对于已经涨了很多的股票，即使财报非常好，也往往会下跌。过去几周我们已经看到了这种情况。所以，如果发生这种情况，虽然这是我最大的持仓，但我心态很好。我对公司的执行力非常满意和高兴。就像 Tanner 说的，上行惊喜的机会比较小，但我想反驳一点，你说事件合约是“小事”，但预测市场在 Robinhood 的叙事中绝不是小事。所以我认为这将是本季度的重中之重。其他的惊喜可能来自**股票借贷**（Stock Lending: 将持有的股票借给他人以赚取利息），上次我们就看到了一个巨大的惊喜，他们也对此做了一些评论。当然还有新的收购，你提到了 Bitstamp，还有 Trade PMR。保证金利率我们不知道上个月的数据，但前两个月的数据绝对是惊人的。当然还有国际扩张。所以，任何事都可能发生。很多情况是已知的，我们知道财报会很好，问题是到底有多好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback just because we've been running hard. The markets doing a little bit better today, but there is some weakness on it and it tends to sell off even very good earnings for names that have risen a lot. Um we've seen that over the last couple of weeks. So, you know, if that happens, I mean, it's my largest position, but I'm sitting pretty. Um I'm I'm very happy and pleased with the execution. And there there is a you know like like Tanner said there's less opportunity for surprise on the upside but I I would push back on one thing you you said small things like event contracts uh predictions market is not a small thing especially in the narrative that is Robin Hood and so I think that that's going to be paramount uh this quarter additional surprises could also come from stock lending we saw a huge surprise they had some commentary on it last time of course the uh the new acquisitions you mentioned bitstamp but also trade PMR uh margin rates we don't know those for the previous month. We do for the first two and they were absolutely ridiculous. And of course, international expansion. So, um, anything can happen. A lot's known. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 我之所以说“小”，是因为我记得我们甚至看到了第三季度交易了多少合约。大概是 20 亿份合约，粗略算下来大约是 2000 万美元的收入。这大概只占我们预期收入的 1%。所以我确实期望它们会增长，我只是说在本季度，它不会那么重要。仅此而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The the only reason why I said small is because I think we even seen how many contracts were traded in Q3. It was something like, you know, uh, 2 billion contracts, whatever, which roughly comes out to $20 million. That's roughly like 1% of the revenue of what we're expecting. So like I am expecting them to grow. I just mean in this quarter it's not going to be that material. That's all.</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 是的，我的想法是市场是向前看的，你会看到大多数问题，甚至我们自己的一些问题，可能都会集中在预测市场上。这是一个正在迅速加速的、强劲的未来增长驱动力。我认为这可能会成为推动未来股价的重要部分，当然这取决于他们如何报告以及他们会说些什么。他们也可能会发布 10 月份的数据，我们以前见过他们这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and my thought is just the market's forwardlooking and you'll see I think we'll see most questions maybe even some of our questions too on uh the predictions market. That's that's a future a strong future growth driver that's accelerating rapidly. Um and I think that's probably depending on of course how they report that and what they say as far as of course they also might release October numbers too. uh we've seen them do that before, but uh that's going to be a big part of what drives I think the stock in the future.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与Robinhood的惊人表现

**Amit:** 市场隐含的波动率是 7%。我认为这个隐含波动率是在今天上涨 5% 之前计算的，这就是为什么财报季有时像一场赌博，因为你永远不知道结果会怎样。Nvidia 在收盘前出现了一波抛售。Applovin 的隐含波动率是 10%，ARM 是 7%，DoorDash 是 8%，Snapchat 是 13%，ONQ 是 9.3%，然后 Figma 作为上市公司发布的第二个季度财报，隐含波动率也是 13%。Nvidia 正在下跌。特斯拉在明天的股东投票前实际上是上涨的。标普 500 指数一度达到 680.8，现在是 678。所以对标普来说今天不算糟糕。SoFi 上涨了 2%，AMD 上涨了 3%。然后 Robinhood 在这里上涨了 5.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh the implied move is 7%. Uh now that implied move, I think was before the 5% move today, which is, you know, it's what makes earnings such a gamble sometimes because you just never know how it's going to play out. Nvidia kind of getting a dump right here into the close. Applovin has a 10% move. ARM 7%, Door Dash 8%, Snapchat 13%, ONQ 9.3, and then Figma uh as their second quarter as a public company. That is also a 13% move. Nvidia right there going down. Tesla actually up going into the shareholder vote tomorrow. S&P 500 did hit 680.8 right now. We're at 678. So, not a horrible day for the S&P. SoFi is up 2%. AMD is up 3%. And then Robin right here up 5 and a half% as we are getting into a pound right there down about 1.5. Then Reddit up 0.2.</p>
</details>

我认为在我们进入财报季时，需要理解的另一件重要事情，并且要始终把它放在背景中看，那就是 Robinhood 在 2023 年 12 月时股价是 7 美元，现在是 144 美元。它是整个标普 500 指数中表现最好的股票，因为他们在两个月前被纳入了标普 500 指数。所以，祝贺所有股东，他们也成功进入了标普 500。所以，看，如果股价下跌 10%，那么它的涨幅就从 230% 变成 225% 或 220%。到了这个地步，这些数字就变得有点像是“好吧，它显然涨了很多”。对于像我们这样重仓的人来说，这会对投资组合造成实质性伤害，但我们不能不心存感激。我只想看到公司继续执行。只要他们执行得好，我认为长期股东就会得到回报。如果你在赌财报，你必须记住，我们已经有很多公司给出了非常好的数据，但很多利好已经被市场消化了，这意味着从股价走势来看，财报结果不一定如你所愿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the other important thing to understand uh as we get into this earnings um and just always to put some context into it, Robin Hood was $7 back in December of 2023. It is now 144. It is the best performing stock in the entire S&P 500 because they got in to the S&P 500 two months ago. So, uh congratulations to all shareholders on them getting into the S&P 500 as well. So, look, if the stock does take a dip and it goes down 10%, instead of being up 230%, it's up 225% or 220%. Like it's it's at at this point the numbers become kind of just like okay it's up a lot obviously and it's going to hurt materially portfolios that are have big positions to it like a lot of us do but it's not something we can't be grateful for. So I just want to see the company execute. As long as they execute I think long-term shareholders will be rewarded. If you are speculating on earnings you just got to remember we've had a lot of companies give really good numbers but a lot of it was priced in and that means the the earnings don't necessarily turn out the way you want in terms of stock price action.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 是的，公司的长期愿景是我们三个人都关注的焦点。除非他们公布负数，否则这将有助于公司的长期发展，看到更多用户更频繁地交易，增加他们在 Robinhood 上的总钱包份额。从我最近看到的一切来看，比如 Vlad Tenev 与特斯拉社区和 Open Door 社区的互动，他们只会激励和希望更多人来到这个平台。老实说，我认为这正在奏效。所以我认为第三季度会很好。我认为第四季度，除了可能出现的交易量不足之外，Robinhood 的市场份额增长实际上也会非常可观。但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the the long-term vision of the company is what I think all three of us are focused on. And unless they show negative numbers, it's going to help out the long-term vision of this company, seeing more members that are transacting more often, that are increasing their total share of wallet on Robin Hood. And from everything I'm seeing lately, like with Vlad Tennv's interaction with the Tesla community and the Open Door community, they only are incentivizing and wanting people more to come onto that platform. And I honestly think it's working. So I I think Q3 is going to be good. I think Q4, aside from the lack of trading volume that might end up showing up, I actually think Robin Hood will see an outsized amount of market share growth in Q4 as well. But we'll see.</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 是的，这是他们最后一个比较容易的比较基期了。第四季度的比较基期会更难。我认为他们会没问题，但之后会更具挑战性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this this is the last pretty easy comp that they have. Q4 will be harder. Um I think they'll be fine, but uh it does get more challenging beyond this.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 在进入财报讨论时，另一件重要的事情是这些新产品的发展轨迹。正如 Roy 和 Tanner 所说，预测市场是一件大事。我认为每个人都开始意识到，预测市场已经成为任何大型事件文化的一部分，无论是纽约市长选举还是体育赛事。因此，作为一个有朝一日可能成长为十亿美元业务的产品，我认为管理层谈论它会非常重要。信用卡现在大概有 45 万用户，候补名单上大概有超过 300 万人。所以整个银行业生态系统很重要。我们九月份刚刚参加了 Hood 峰会，我们很多人都在那里见到了你们。Cortex AI、Robin Hood Social。我的意思是，他们为 2026 年准备了很多不同的垂直领域可以开拓。所以，我也会好奇他们会如何谈论他们最新产品的增长，比如期货、指数期权，以及他们今年推出的所有不同产品，我认为超过 15 种。然后，这些将如何影响 2026 年的情况，无论市场是像超级碗一样火爆，还是平淡，甚至是熊市。他们如何为公司未来的发展定位？我认为这是很多人会关心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think uh the other thing that's important going into earnings is um the trajectory of these new products. So, as Roy and Tanner were talking about, prediction markets is a big deal. I think everyone is starting to realize that prediction markets are part of the culture of just any big event, whether it's the New York mayor election or uh sports events. So that as a as a product that can grow into a billion dollar business one day. I think that's going to be really important for management to talk about. Credit card now is like 450,000 people. Uh I think over three million people on the wait list. So the whole banking ecosystem that's important. We just had hood summit in September. All of us got to meet a bunch of you guys there. Uh Cortex AI, Robin Hood social. I mean there's a lot of different verticals I think they have ready to tap into for 2026. So, I would also be curious to see how they talk about the growth that of their latest products, futures, index options, all the different things they ship this year, which I think is well over 15 different products. And then how that bleeds into what's going to happen in 26 regardless of if it's a Super Bowl market or if it's, you know, casual or even if it's a bare market. How do they position the company going forward in the future? And I think that's what a lot of people will care about.</p>

### Robinhood Q3 2025 财报亮点

**Amit:** 好的，各位，我们来了。距离市场收盘还有 30 秒。再次感谢大家，我和 Roy、Tanner 非常感激能和大家一起走过这段旅程。我们感谢你们在过去几年里一直关注我们的内容。Robinhood 改变了我们所有人的生活，我想它也改变了聊天室里很多人的生活。今天又是一个季度，我们得以见证公司的持续进步。周三，11 月 5 日，下午 4 点。股市现已收盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, folks. Here we go. We got 30 seconds until this market closes. Uh once again, me, Roy, and Tanner are very, very grateful to be on the journey with everybody. And uh we just thank you for being along with us over the past couple years consuming the content. And Robin Hood has changed all of our lives. I imagine it's changed a lot of people's lives here in the chat. And today is another quarter where we get to see the company continue to progress. Wednesday, November 5th, 4 p.m. The stock market is now closed.</p>
</details>

好的，我们来了。我们将在接下来的几分钟内得到结果。Tanner、Roy 和我将刷新我们的屏幕，看看我们得到了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, here we go. We will be getting results in the next couple of minutes. Tanner Roy and I will be refreshing our screens to see what we get.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 哦，Robinhood 下跌了。Robinhood 下跌了。那里有一根红色蜡烛。我们立即看到了一根红色蜡烛。然后现在红色蜡烛……它从 140 跌到了 137 一秒钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, Robin is down. Robin is down. There's a red candle right there. We got a red candle immediately. Then it's now the red candle's not it went from 140 to 137 for a second again.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我还没有拿到 Hood 的数据。它下跌了 2.6%。确实是红色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh don't have the hood numbers yet. It's down 2.6. It is indeed red.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 好的，我拿到数据了。EPS 61 美分，营收 12.7 亿美元。他们双双超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I got the numbers. uh 61 cents of EPS, 1.27 billion. They double beat.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我的天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my gosh.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 营收同比增长 100%。EPS 同比增长 260%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Revenue is up 100% year-over-year. EPS is up 260% year-over-year.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 漂亮。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nice. Okay,</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 我不知道他们是怎么做到的，伙计。股价可以随心所欲。天哪，兄弟。我的天哪。营收环比增长 29%。兄弟，我们以为他们能达到 12 亿就很困难了，结果是 12.74 亿。我的天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">another I don't know how they do it, man. The stock can do whatever they want. Goodness gracious, dude. Oh my goodness. Revenues up 29% quarter over quarter. Dude, we thought it was going to be hard for them to get 1.2 1.2 274. Oh my gosh.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 再一次，当你看到这种数字时，你必须超越股价本身，然后感叹，天哪，61 美分的 EPS，这意味着他们的运营杠杆可能在这个季度变得更好了，这已经是连续第八个季度了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, you gota you got to look past the the stock price when you see these types of numbers and be like, goodness gracious, 61 cents versus that means their operating leverage probably got even better this quarter for like the eighth consecutive quarter in a row.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 我想知道是什么促成了这个结果。这比我的估计高出近 1.5 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wonder what contributed to that. That's that's like almost 150 million above what my estimates were.</p>
</details>

### CFO退休引发市场波动

**CNBC:** 公司公布每股收益 61 美分，高于分析师预期的 53 美分，营收为 12.7 亿美元，高于预期的 11.9 亿美元。尽管股票和期权交易量创下纪录，但基于交易的收入略低于预期，为 7.3 亿美元，但这部分缺口被净利息收入的强劲增长所抵消。同时，入金账户数量也略低于预期，为 2688 万。与此同时，高管层发生变动。新的**CFO**（Chief Financial Officer: 首席财务官）Shiv Verma 将接替 Jason Warick。我刚才和他们俩都谈过了。他们指出预测市场是一个主要的亮点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Posted earnings of 61 cents a share above the 53 cents that analysts expected and revenue of 1.27 billion versus the 1.19 billion estimate. transaction-based revenue that was a little bit light at 730 million despite record trading volume in equities and options but that shortfall was offset by strong gains in net interest income. Now funded accounts also a slight miss at 26.8 8 million. Meanwhile, a seauite shakeup. New CFO Shiv Verma is taking over for Jason Warick. I spoke to them both moments ago. They pointed to prediction markets as a major.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 这可能是股价下跌的原因，华尔街喜欢 Jason Warick。他卸任本身不是坏事，但如果他因为任何原因卸任，我们总是会看到华尔街在高管变动时出现膝跳反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That could be the reason the street likes Jason Warick. It's not a bad thing that he's stepping down, but if he is stepping down for whatever reason he is. We always see knee-jerk reactions by the street when there's a seauite shakeup.</p>
</details>

**CNBC:** 他们称其为有史以来增长最快的业务。第三季度的合约交易量比第二季度翻了一番。仅在 10 月份，他们的交易量就超过了整个上一季度。他们说，进入第四季度的势头强劲，客户存款和活动都创下纪录。不过，股价现在下跌了超过 4.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bright spot calling it their fastest growing business ever. Contract volume doubled in Q3 versus the second quarter. And in October alone, they saw more trading than the entire prior quarter. They say that momentum is strong heading into Q4 with record customer deposits and activity.

**Amit:** 好的，我来解读一下。营收同比增长 100%，达到 12.7 亿美元。净存款创纪录，达到 200 亿美元。天哪，我想他们之前最多也就 130 亿。净存款增加了 70 亿。Robinhood Gold 订阅用户创纪录，达到 390 万。EPS 为 61 美分。Robinhood 现在有 11 个业务线的年化收入达到或超过 1 亿美元。

<p class="english-text">All right. Let me read through this. Here we go. Revenue up 100% year-over-year. 1.27 billion. Net deposits were record 20 billion. Dude, I think the most they've ever done is 13 billion. Oh my god. 7 billion increase on net deposits. Robin Hood Gold subscribers record 3.9 million. EPS 61 cents. Robin and now to 11 business lines generating 100 more million or more in annualized revenues.</p>
</details>

Vlad 说：“我们团队不懈的产品迭代速度在第三季度创造了创纪录的业务成果，而且我们没有放慢脚步。预测市场正在迅速增长，Robinhood Banking 开始推出，Robinhood Ventures 也即将到来。” 他还说：“第三季度是又一个实现盈利性增长的强劲季度，我们继续多元化我们的业务，增加了两个年化收入达到或超过 1 亿美元的业务线：预测市场和 Bitstamp。第四季度开局强劲，10 月份的股票、期权、预测市场和期货的月度交易量均创下纪录，保证金余额也创下新高。”

<p class="english-text">Here we go. Our team's relentless product velocity drove record business results in Q3 and we're not slowing down. Prediction markets growing rapidly. Robin Banking is starting to roll out and Robin Adventures is coming, said Vlad. Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth and we continue to diversify our business adding two or more business lines, prediction markets in Bitstamp that are generating approximately 100 million or more in annualized revenues. And Q4 is off to a strong start in October with record monthly trading volumes across equities, options, prediction markets, and futures and new highs for margin balances.</p>

净营收 12.7 亿美元。交易收入 7.3 亿。净利息收入 4.56 亿，我想这是他们有史以来最高的，或者接近最高。其他收入 8800 万。净利润 5.56 亿美元。所以 12.7 亿的收入中有 5.56 亿是纯利润。入金客户 2680 万。资产 3330 亿，这相当庞大。净存款 204 亿，再次强调，这简直不可思议。**ARPU**（Average Revenue Per User: 每用户平均收入）为 191 美元。黄金订阅用户增加了近 200 万，总数达到 390 万。他们有 43 亿美元现金。他们以 104 美元的价格回购了 100 万股自家股票，花费了 1.07 亿美元。所以通过股票回购减少了约 100 万股。10 月份净存款为 55 亿美元，保证金增长 150% 至 160 亿美元，这与我们从 FINRA 听到的情况类似，即保证金贷款在所有券商中都处于历史最高水平。股票交易量 3200 亿，我好像从没见过一个月有 3200 亿这个数字。期权交易量 2.6 亿，我想我们见过最多的是 1.95 亿。加密货币交易量 320 亿，而 10 月份的加密市场表现并不好，比特币和以太坊表现不佳。所以这太不可思议了。

<p class="english-text">Uh net revenues again 1.27 billion. Transaction 730. Net interest 456. I think that's their highest ever or close to their highest. Other revenues 88 million. Uh net income 556 million. So 556 out of the 1.27 billion was pure profit. Um adjusted eBay 177% funded customers 26.8 million. Assets 333 billion. It's pretty big. Net deposits 20.4. Again, that is just incredible. Arpoo is at 191 a user. Gold subscribers up by almost 2 million, 3.9 million total. They have 4.3 billion in cash. They bought a million shares of their stock at a 104. So, they spent 107 million buying their stock. Um, and so you had about a million shares with the share buybacks. October net deposits were 5 a.5 billion margin up 150% to 16 billion which is similar to what we've heard from uh FINRA right that that and margin loans are at their highest levels ever across every brokerage equity volumes 320 billion I don't think I've ever seen a number in one month at 320. I don't think we've seen that options guys 260 million I think the most we've seen is like 195. Crypto volume's 32 billion. And crypto was bad in October. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum were not doing the best. So that's incredible.</p>

好的，就是这样。CFO Jason Warick 宣布明年退休。Jason 将在第一季度从 CFO 职位上过渡，并担任战略顾问。这可能是股价下跌的原因，仅仅因为 CFO 退休了。但情况就是这样。Roy，你对这些数字的初步看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, that's what you got. A CFO Jason Warick announces intention to retire next year. Jason will transition from his role as CFO in Q1 and be a strategic adviser. That could be why the stock is dumping just that the CFO is retiring. But that's what you got. Uh Roy, your kind of raw thoughts on these numbers.</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 我的意思是，是的，太荒谬了。分析师和我们的期望都很高，但他们仍然超出了预期。这是一家执行力极强的公司，基本面火力全开。未来还有很多增长杠杆。我同意你的看法，可能很多利好已经被计入了股价，你可能已经定价到完美，也许情况就是这样。但当一家公司的 CFO 离职时，股价出现下跌并不罕见。我实际上看到这种情况比 CEO 离职时更常见，因为 CFO 是一个关键角色，有时人们会想，“哦，他们要走了，所以肯定有什么非常糟糕的事情要发生了。” 当然，我认为 Robinhood 的情况并非如此。我认为这一直是计划的一部分。Jason 非常出色，我祝愿他未来一切顺利。但是，是的，这是一个非常有才华的团队，所以那里没有担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, yeah, ridiculous. Uh we expectations were high from analysts and also from us and they they still beat it. Uh this is a company that executes fundamentally their fire on all cylinders. Um a lot of future growth levers too and I agree with you like that probably you know maybe it's some of it a lot of it was priced in u you could be priced to perfection and maybe that's the case but it's not uncommon when the CFO of a company leaves that there is a dip afterwards. I I've actually seen that more often than when the CEO leaves just because CFO is a critical role and sometimes which will not be the case for Robin Hood. There's people like, "Oh, they're leaving so it must be something that's really bad that's out there." Well, I don't think that's the case. I think this has been the "always been the plan". Jason's amazing. Um, and I wish him well in whatever he has in the future. But, uh, yeah, it's a very talented group, so no concerns there.</p>

<p class="english-text">That is the highest I've ever seen. Wow. There you go. 131.</p>

是的，它击败了 Nvidia，击败了 Palantir，而这两家公司的数据都非常惊人。顺便说一下，基于交易的收入和净利息收入也创下了历史新高，其他收入也接近历史新高。所以，相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it beats Nvidia. It beats uh Palunteer. And those both have insane numbers. And And by the way, all-time high uh on uh transactionbased revenues and net interest revenues as well. um and nearly the all-time high on other revenues. So, pretty good.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 好的，所以交易收入 7.3 亿，其中股票 2.68 亿，期权 3.04 亿，加密货币 2.68 亿。所以这仍然是一个非常好的季度。这看起来是他们有史以来最高的交易收入。是的，历史最高。其他利息收入 7200 万，净利息收入也是历史新高，我想。是的，这是他们第一次突破 4 亿。信用卡业务收入 1700 万，现金管理 6400 万，保证金业务，看看这个，从 1.14 亿增长到 1.53 亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so transaction 730 they did 268 in equity, 304 options, 86 in uh or 86 in equity, 304 in options, 268 in crypto. So, it's still a really good quarter quarter. This is their highest they've ever done in transactions, it looks like. Uh yeah, highest ever. 72 million in other interest, net interest high, I think. Yeah, it's first time they broke 400. Credit card did 17 cash sweep 64 margin. Look at that dude. 114 to 153 on margin.</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 是的，我们当然看到了 10 月份的数据，但前两个月的保证金增长简直是疯狂的。我们在其他平台上也看到了这种情况，但 Robinhood 做得非常好。他们大约一年前提出的降低利率以获取市场份额的想法，他们做到了。顺便说一下，幻灯片 13 有一个关于市场份额的图表，也非常酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we saw u of course we see the October numbers now, but like the the prior two months were just insane margin acceleration. We're seeing that on other platforms too, but Robin Hood is killing it. And their their idea to uh like I think it was a year ago where they said we're going to take lower rates. So, we're going to lower these rates and gain market share. They've done that. By the way, there is a market share slide on slide 13, which is really cool, too.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 好的，所以股票市场份额，他们估计占有 1.07% 的市场。加密货币市场份额，他们有 1.08%，增长了 100%。股票业务增长了 138%。这是过去三年从 2022 年开始的数据。期权业务占 7.5%，增长了 68%。保证金业务不到 1%，但增长了 55%。这意味着所有这些业务都还没有真正渗透市场。这就是 Robinhood 的增长故事。我的意思是，如果这些业务在未来十年内都能达到 10% 的市场份额，老实说，我觉得这还是非常保守的估计，那么他们每个季度都会有数十亿美元的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so equities market share, they're estimating they have 1.07% of the market. Uh crypto market share, they have 1.08, which is up 100%. Equities up 138%. This is over the past three years from 22. Options 7 and a half% that's up 68%. margin less than 1% but that's up 55%. Which means all of these are not really penetrated yet. And that's the growth story on Robin Hood. I mean if the if these all get to like 10% over the next decade and I feel like that's being very conservative to be honest like they're going to be doing billions and billions of dollars of revenue every single quarter.</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 我刚刚看了他们的运营费用，基本上保持平稳。利润率确实扩大了。是的，这真是一个疯狂的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just went through their operating expenses for the most part it it did stay flat. It definitely margins did expand. Um, yeah, this is such an insane business.</p>
</details>

**Roy:** 幻灯片 14 对我来说很有趣，特别是最后一列，加密货币名义交易量。他们很贴心地把 Bitstamp 单独列出来了。我不知道，也许是我搞错了，但这比我预期的 Bitstamp 数据要高。所以我很好奇 Robinhood 是否能做到他们通常在收购后能做到的事，即不仅能很好地整合，还能加速它们的发展。所以这是值得关注的一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, slide 14's interesting to me on that last column, the cryptonotional volumes. They they helpfully break out Bitstamp there. That's I don't know, may maybe I was just off, but that's higher than I expected for Bitstamp, too. So, I'm curious if Robin Hood is able to do what they're usually able to do with acquisitions where they don't just integrate them well, but they also accelerate them as uh so something to keep an eye on.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** Hood 的股价回到了 140 美元以上。我真的认为最初的下跌与 CFO 离职有关。每当华尔街熟悉的高管卸任时，都会被立即解读为坏消息，而那个人可能只是进入了人生的另一个阶段。但我认为这就是最初下跌的原因。我的意思是，聊天室里有人能告诉我，除了市场本身的原因，这只股票在公布这些数据后有什么理由会下跌吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hood is back over 140. I think I I really do think that initial decline had to do with the CFO leaving. Uh every time a seauite that the street knows about is stepping down, it immediately interpreted as bad and the dude might just be moving on to a different point of his life. Um but I think that's why you had the initial I mean dude I I mean can anyone in the chat tell me a reason this stock should even kind of be down after these numbers outside of just the market being the market?</p>
</details>

**Tanner:** 100%。我们作为非常看好的投资者，对这只股票抱有很高的期望。而这一次，我认为它再次超出了我们所有人的预期。当你能够持续地、一个季度接一个季度地做到这一点时，这就是为什么它值得比同行业其他公司更高的估值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100%. We come in as very bullish investors with high expectations for this name. Uh this beat I think all of our expectations once again. And whenever you do that constantly quarter after quarter after quarter that's why it deserves a higher multiple than other companies in their you know sector.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 正确。如果一家公司已经持续多年证明他们可以超越预期，而且不仅仅是超越，而是真正地大幅超越，那么你就必须给他们一个溢价，有时支付这个溢价是可以接受的，因为你正在购买一家划时代的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. And and if a company has given you constant at this point years of proving they can beat expectations and not just beat them but really beat them, that's where you got to just, you know, give them a premium and it is okay sometimes to pay that premium because you're buying a generational company.</p>

### 财报电话会：管理层解读与未来展望

**Vlad Tenev:** 大家好，我正在我们的办公室里，准备参加我们从旧金山大通中心直播的 2025 年第三季度财报电话会议。简单总结一下：第三季度是又一个创纪录的季度，这得益于我们持续不懈的产品迭代速度。营收比去年翻了一番，创下历史新高。同时，每股收益也增长了两倍多。我们在三个战略支柱上都取得了巨大进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everyone, I'm here in our offices getting ready for our Q3 2025 earnings call streaming live from the Chase Center in San Francisco. Here's a quick rundown. Q3 was another record quarter driven by our continued relentless product velocity. Revenues doubled from last year to a record high. EPS also more than tripled at the same time. And we made great progress across our three strategic pillars.</p>
</details>

首先，对于活跃交易者，我们在第三季度创下了股票和期权交易量的记录。保证金账户余额在过去 18 个月里增长了两倍，创下历史新高。我们的预测市场正在飞速发展，仅在第三季度就交易了超过 20 亿份事件合约。不仅如此，10 月份的规模更大，甚至超过了整个第三季度的总和。我们还增加了职业和大学橄榄球、娱乐、政治、经济、科技等更多领域的合约。这正在成为一个全面的产品，不仅为交易者服务，也成为一个全新的信息来源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, for active traders, we set records for equity and options trading volumes in Q3. Margin account balances tripled over the past 18 months to a record high. And our prediction markets are ripping with over two billion event contracts traded in Q3 alone. Not only that, October was even bigger, bigger than all of Q3 combined. And we've added contracts for pro and college football, entertainment, politics, economics, technology, and so much more. This is really becoming a comprehensive offering, not just for traders, but also brand new source of information.</p>
</details>

其次，在钱包份额方面，我们希望成为您的主要和次要金融账户，并且我们正在取得很大进展。我们看到平台总资产势头强劲，现在有三分之一万亿美元的资产存放在 Robinhood。客户们非常喜欢我们的长期投资产品，Robinhood Retirement 和 Robinhood Strategies 的增长都非常出色。此外，我们正在迅速向更多客户发放金卡，并且也已经开始推出 Robinhood Banking。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Second, on the wallet share front, we want to be your primary and secondary financial account, and we're making a lot of progress. We're seeing strong momentum in total platform assets with a third of a trillion dollars now held at Robin Hood. Customers are loving our long-term investing products, both Robin Hood Retirement and Robin Hood Strategies ramping up super nicely. Plus, we're rapidly shipping gold cards to more customers, and we've begun the roll out for Robin Hood banking as well.</p>
</details>

第三，同样重要的是，我们正在全球扩张，以建立世界第一的全球金融生态系统。**通证化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的权利转换为区块链上的数字代币的过程）是我们全球扩张的一大助推器。我们继续执行我们的路线图，将提供给客户的股票代币数量增加了一倍以上。我们还推出了永续期货。在美国，我们很高兴通过 Robinhood Ventures 为散户股东提供接触私营公司的机会。未来还有更多精彩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, last but not least, we're expanding globally as we build the number one global financial ecosystem. Tokenization has been a big accelerant to our global expansion. And you might see in this chalkboard here from our European event in Europe. We're continuing to execute on our roadmap and we more than doubled the number of stock tokens available to our customers. We also rolled out perpetual futures and in the US we're excited to bring access to private companies to retail shareholders through Robin Hood Ventures. Plenty more to come there.</p>
</details>

### 问答环节：深入探讨核心业务

**分析师:** 我有一个关于预测市场的问题。你们显然已经成为这个领域的领导者之一，但最近有很多新的进入者。所以，我希望你们能谈谈这方面的策略，以及你们认为是什么让你们有长期获胜的权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, thank you for taking the question. For my question, I want to say congratulations to both Jason and Shiv. Jason, really enjoyed working with you. Shiv, looking forward to getting to know you a little better. So, I had one on prediction markets. You've obviously become one of the leaders in the space, but there's been a lot of new entrance recently. So, I was hoping you could talk about just the strategy there and what you think gives you the right to win long term.</p>
</details>

**Vlad Tenev:** 是的。我认为我们进入任何市场的一个优势，预测市场也不例外，就是我们拥有分销渠道和大量客户——在美国有超过 2600 万的入金账户。从基础设施的角度来看，我们拥有一套不断增长的、为多资产构建的工具。这不仅仅是我们的移动应用，还越来越多地体现在网页端。我们有 Robinhood Legend，以及我们在 Hood Summit 上宣布的所有这些东西。这实际上是一个金融服务的生态系统。你会看到我们所有平台、所有资产和账户类型之间会有很好的整合，未来会越来越好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. So I think one of the advantages we have uh entering any market uh prediction markets aren't uh an exception is that we have distribution and we have lots of customers 26 million plus funded accounts uh in the US that uh are trading and using us for for all sorts of things. And from an infrastructure standpoint, uh, we actually have an increasing set of tools that can plug in and are are being built to be multi-asset. So, not just our mobile app, but increasingly on web. We have Robin Hood Legend. We have all of these things that uh that that we announced at Hood Summit. And it's really an ecosystem of financial services. and you'll see great integration between all of our platforms and and all of our assets and account types uh increasingly so in the future.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** Vlad，Jason，谢谢你们接受我的提问。Jason，非常感谢你多年来的执行力，也祝贺你，Shiv，担任新角色。我的问题是给你的，Vlad。回到通证化的话题，你最近说通证化将吞噬更广泛的金融体系。除了通证化的股票，你能否给我们一个更宏观的视角，说明这个机会有多大？为什么现在是追逐这个机会的时候？以及 Robinhood 在未来几年里真正考虑如何利用这个机会。我知道除了股票，还有很多其他不同的资产可以被通证化。所以你能否多谈谈你们是如何看待这个机会的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey Vlad. Hey Jason. Thank you guys for uh taking my question and a big thank you Jason over the years on your execution and congrats to you Shiv on your new role. Um, my question is for you, Vlad. Going back to tokenization, you recently said tokenization will eat the broader financial system. Outside of just tokenized equities, can you give us a more larger look on how big of a size the opportunity is? Why right now is the time to go after it and what Robin is really thinking about over the next couple of years in terms of taking advantage of the opportunity. I know there's a lot of different other assets besides equities that could be tokenized. So can you just speak a little bit more on how you guys are thinking of the opportunity?</p>
</details>

**Vlad Tenev:** 是的，我认为这个机会非常令人兴奋。我认为传统加密货币的一个问题，同时也是一个机会，就是直到最近，加密货币和传统金融体系一直是两个独立的世界。我认为 Robinhood 作为一个规模化的加密业务，同时也是传统金融领域的规模化业务，拥有独特的地位来连接这两者，并为我们认为是传统资产，但实际上像证券这样具有真正基础效用的产品，利用区块链技术并在链上进行交易创造空间。在链上，客户可以自我托管，可以与各种协议互动，进行抵押借贷，这些资产可以 24/7 实时以零散数量进行交易。我个人感到兴奋的其他机会是房地产、私人信贷、独特的资产和收藏品，比如艺术品。如果你想一下，如果你是一个高净值人士，你的投资组合中有很多这类资产，而目前散户是无法接触到的。我认为通证化是一种能够大规模实现这一点的方式，并减少通常与持有这些资产相关的缺点，比如缺乏流动性、被锁定在头寸中、无法将资产分块投资等。所以，这就是我们继续推动它的原因，无论是在美国还是在海外。你应该会看到，在未来几年里，这个领域会变得越来越大，当然，从我们认为潜力最大、也最接近的资产类别——股票开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that the opportunity is very exciting. One of the things that um I think is both a problem and an opportunity with uh traditional crypto is that crypto and the traditional financial system up until fairly recently have kind of been two separate worlds. And I think Robin Hood has a unique position as a scaled crypto business, but also a scaled business in traditional finance to bridge the two and actually make room for uh what we consider traditional assets, but really things like securities, uh products with real fundamental utility to leverage blockchain technology and actually be tradable onchain. uh where customers can self-custody, they can engage with a variety of protocols, collateralize borrowing and and lending and where those assets can be traded 24/7 real time in fractional quantities. Um you've obviously seen some efforts in private companies uh in the EU with our OpenAI and SpaceX uh token giveaways there. Um, so I I think we're we're really interested in in continuing to pull on that and and making those products uh available to customers. Uh, the other opportunities that I'm personally excited about is uh real estate, private credit, uh, unique assets and collectibles like art. Um, if you think about, you know, what what's a a part of your portfolio if you're a high- netw worth individual, there's a lot of these assets that actually retail can't access currently. And I think that tokenization is a way to enable that at scale uh and sort of like reduce some of the downsides that would would typically be associated with holding those assets like lack of liquidity, being locked into positions, not being able to like chunk the assets out and and invest in portions of them. So, uh, that's why we're continuing to push on it, um, both in the US and and outside. And you should expect this to become bigger and bigger, uh, in the coming years, of course, starting with stocks, which is uh, the asset class that we think has the most potential and we're also closest to.</p>
