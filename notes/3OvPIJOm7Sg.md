### 财报发布前的期待与预测

Amit: 好的，大家好。欢迎回到新一期的 Robinhood 财报解读。这是 2025 年第三季度的财报。非常高兴能和大家在这里相聚。今天和我一起的，是过去几年里与我并肩同行的两位朋友，Roy 和 Tanner。能和朋友们一起经历这段旅程，我感到非常有意义。你们好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another edition of Robin Hood Earnings. This is Q3 2025. Very excited to be here with everybody. I'm here with two people that have been on the journey with me over the past couple years and it has been very rewarding to be on this journey with friends Roy and Tanner. How you guys doing?</p>
</details>

Roy: 好极了。是的，我很兴奋。这是我持仓最重的股票。无论结果如何我都不担心。这是一家了不起的公司，执行力惊人。股价也涨了很多。我们知道财报会很好，问题是到底有多好，以及市场会作何反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Doing great. Yeah, I'm excited. my largest position. Not worried either way. Amazing company, amazing execution. Stock is way up. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good and how will the market react.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，兄弟。我真的非常激动，不仅想看 Hood 会交出怎样的成绩单，还觉得这次的问答环节会非常有趣。他们正在进入许多新市场：信用卡、预测市场、银行业务。我认为他们可以用一些对股价有实质性推动作用的方式来回答问题。除此之外，今天还有很多其他令人兴奋的公司发布财报。我想我们会一边听 Hood 的电话会议，一边关注那边的几个问题。但总的来说，今天将会是信息量非常大的一天。所以，应该会很刺激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: Yeah. Yeah, dude. I am really freaking excited to see not only what Hood is going to put up, but a lot of the Q&A this time around, I also think is going to be really interesting. They're entering so many new markets this time around. credit cards, prediction markets, banking, they can really answer things in ways that I think could be material to push the stock. Aside from that, there's actually a lot of other companies that are pretty exciting that are also reporting today. I think we'll be listening into the hood call and and having a couple questions there. But, today in general is going to be a very jam-packed day. So, should be exciting.</p>
</details>

### 市场普遍预期与关键指标

Amit: 是的。所以今天不仅有 Hood，还有 Duolingo、Applovin、Qualcomm、NQ、Elf、Fortinet、Door Dash、Joby、Lyft、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Centric Energy、Anovix、Honest、Figma，可能还有一些我漏掉的。我们将在 4:05 拿到 Hood 的财报结果。我们会花大约 20 到 25 分钟来分析和解读这些数据，然后我们会关注几乎所有其他的股票。上次我们这么做的时候，同时有 Hood、微软和 Meta 的财报，那可是两个需要重点关注的大公司。但如果你持有其他任何股票，我们也会在分析完 Hood 之后立刻跟进。如果有什么股票出现大幅上涨或下跌，我们可能会在直播中途就指出来。但我们还是会先确保完成对 Hood 的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. So, not only do we have Hood, we have Dualingo, Apploving, Qualcomm, NQ, Elf, Forinet, Door Dash, Joby, Lyft, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, Centric, Energy, Anovix, Honest, Figma, and probably a couple others that I'm missing. So, we're going to get the results on Hood at 405. We're going to try to analyze the results at least for about 20 25 minutes and kind of break them down and then we're going to get to pretty much every other stock. Last time we did this, we had Hood, Microsoft, and Meta. So, those were two big names to pay attention to. But if you're in any of the other names, we will try to get the coverage immediately right after we get Hood. If there's like a big mover up or down, we'll probably call it out in the middle of it. But we are going to see if we can get that Hood coverage.</p>
</details>

Amit: 华尔街预计其营收为 12.2 亿美元。有些分析师预测是 12 亿，另一些是 12.2 亿。所以，关于预期的确切营收数字可能存在一点混乱，上次也发生过类似情况，但预期值确实上升了。最初是 10.1 亿，所以已经上涨了大约 2 亿美元，**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，指公司每一普通股股份所摊占的税后利润）为 54 美分。我会在聊天区发起一个“上涨或下跌”的投票。很明显，在财报发布前，股价正在上涨，大约涨了 5%。Tanner，我们从你开始。你认为股价会怎么走？你觉得他们会在营收和利润上都超出预期吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: So, the street is expecting 1.22 billion in revenue. Some analysts have 1.2, others have 1.22. So, might be a little, this happened last time, a little bit of confusion on exactly what the expected revenue number is, but it has gone up. Originally, it was 1.01. So, it's gone up by about 200 million and 54 cents of EPS. I'm going to do the pump or dump poll in the chat. Obviously, the stock is moving going into the print, up about 5%. Tanner, we'll start with you. What do you think happens to the stock? And do you think they beat on the top and the bottom line?</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我的预测是 12 亿美元，略低于华尔街的预期。然后我的 EPS 预测是 55 美分，这也比较保守。有几项因素我没有计算在内，所以我的预测可能和华尔街的差不多。我之所以和华尔街的预测如此接近，是因为对于这只股票，我们几乎不需要做什么猜测。我的意思是，除了最近三个交易日，我们已经看到了过去三个月的所有交易量数据。所以，市场共识会非常集中。我们唯一不知道的是业务的**抽成率**（Take Rate: 指平台或公司从每笔交易中收取的费用占交易总额的比例）以及其他一些小细节，比如事件合约（event contracts）的收入。但即便如此，他们也向我们展示了细节，比如第三季度交易了 20 亿份期权合约等等。所以我不知道，伙计。我希望他们能带来一个巨大的惊喜，超出盈利预期。也许是 Bitstamp 的贡献，也许是信用卡的交易量超出了人们的预期。但在季度报告发布前就公布了所有信息的情况下，想给市场带来惊喜是非常困难的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: I have $1.2 billion, which is just slight of what Wall Street's expecting. And then I also have which is also conservative. There's a couple things that I don't have baked in. So, I might be right in line with Wall Street there. And I've got 55 cents of EPS. Now, the reason why I'm so close to Wall Street is because there's very little guessing that we have to do on this name. I mean, we've seen all of the a volume that they've seen over the past 3 months, aside from like three trading days. So, this is why consensus is going to be very tight. The only thing that we don't know is the take rate on the business and and other small things like event contracts and what that means. But even then they've shown us details of you know two billion options contracts traded during Q3 and you know all this different details. So I don't know man I'm hopeful that they just come out with a large surprise and beat earnings. Maybe Bitstamp maybe credit card seeing more transactions than people expect. But it's very hard to surprise on this name whenever you give all of your information before the quarter is even released.</p>
</details>

Amit: 同意。Roy，你对股价的反应有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Agreed. Roy, your thoughts on how you think the stock will react?</p>
</details>

Roy: 如果出现回调，我不会感到惊讶，因为我们已经涨得很猛了。今天市场表现好一些，但还是有些疲软，而且对于那些已经涨了很多的股票，即使财报非常好，也往往会遭遇抛售。过去几周我们已经看到了这种情况。所以，如果发生这种情况，虽然这是我最大的持仓，但我心态很好。我对公司的执行力非常满意和高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback just because we've been running hard. The markets doing a little bit better today, but there is some weakness on it and it tends to sell off even very good earnings for names that have risen a lot. We've seen that over the last couple of weeks. So, you know, if that happens, I mean, it's my largest position, but I'm sitting pretty. I'm very happy and pleased with the execution.</p>
</details>

### Robinhood的潜在增长动力与未知因素

Roy: 就像 Tanner 说的，上行惊喜的机会比较小，但我想反驳一点。你说事件合约是“小事”，但预测市场并非小事，尤其是在 Robinhood 的发展叙事中。所以我认为这将是本季度的重中之重。其他的惊喜可能来自股票借贷业务，上次我们就看到了一个巨大的惊喜，他们对此发表了一些评论。当然，还有你提到的新收购，Bitstamp，以及 Trade PMR。保证金利率我们也不知道上个月的数据，但前两个月的数据绝对是惊人的。当然，还有国际扩张。所以，任何事情都有可能发生。很多情况是已知的，我们知道财报会很好，问题是到底有多好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: And there there is a you know like like Tanner said there's less opportunity for surprise on the upside but I I would push back on one thing you you said small things like event contracts, predictions market is not a small thing especially in the narrative that is Robin Hood and so I think that that's going to be paramount this quarter additional surprises could also come from stock lending we saw a huge surprise they had some commentary on it last time of course the new acquisitions you mentioned bitstamp but also trade PMR margin rates we don't know those for the previous month. We do for the first two and they were absolutely ridiculous. And of course, international expansion. So, anything can happen. A lot's known. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我之所以说它“小”，是因为我想我们甚至看到了第三季度交易了多少合约。大概是，你知道，20 亿份合约，这大约能带来 2000 万美元的收入。这大概只占我们预期收入的 1%。所以我确实期望它们会增长，我只是说在本季度，它不会那么重要。仅此而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: The the only reason why I said small is because I think we even seen how many contracts were traded in Q3. It was something like, you know, 2 billion contracts, whatever, which roughly comes out to $20 million. That's roughly like 1% of the revenue of what we're expecting. So like I am expecting them to grow. I just mean in this quarter it's not going to be that material. That's all.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，我的想法是市场是前瞻性的，你会看到，我认为大部分问题，甚至我们自己的一些问题，都会集中在预测市场上。那是一个正在迅速加速的、强劲的未来增长动力。我认为这可能会成为推动未来股价的重要部分，当然这取决于他们如何报告以及他们会说些什么。他们也可能会发布十月份的数据，我们以前见过他们这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah. And and my thought is just the market's forwardlooking and you'll see I think we'll see most questions maybe even some of our questions too on the predictions market. That's that's a future a strong future growth driver that's accelerating rapidly. And I think that's probably depending on of course how they report that and what they say as far as of course they also might release October numbers too. we've seen them do that before, but that's going to be a big part of what drives I think the stock in the future.</p>
</details>

### 盘前异动与其他公司财报速览

Amit: 隐含波动率是 7%。我想这个隐含波动率是在今天上涨 5% 之前计算的，你知道，这就是为什么财报季有时像一场赌博，因为你永远不知道结果会怎样。Nvidia 在收盘前出现了一波抛售。Applovin 的隐含波动是 10%，ARM 是 7%，Door Dash 是 8%，Snapchat 是 13%，ONQ 是 9.3%，然后 Figma 作为上市公司发布的第二个季度财报，隐含波动也是 13%。Nvidia 正在下跌。特斯拉在明天的股东投票前实际上是上涨的。**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500 Index: 标准普尔500指数，一个记录美国500家上市公司股票的股票指数）确实触及了 680.8，现在是 678。所以对 S&P 来说今天不算糟糕。SoFi 上涨了 2%，AMD 上涨了 3%。然后 Robinhood 在这里上涨了 5.5%。Palantir 下跌了约 1.5%。Reddit 上涨了 0.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: The implied move is 7%. Now that implied move, I think was before the 5% move today, which is, you know, it's what makes earnings such a gamble sometimes because you just never know how it's going to play out. Nvidia kind of getting a dump right here into the close. Applovin has a 10% move. ARM 7%, Door Dash 8%, Snapchat 13%, ONQ 9.3, and then Figma as their second quarter as a public company. That is also a 13% move. Nvidia right there going down. Tesla actually up going into the shareholder vote tomorrow. S&P 500 did hit 680.8 right now. We're at 678. So, not a horrible day for the S&P. SoFi is up 2%. AMD is up 3%. And then Robin right here up 5 and a half% as we are getting into a pound right there down about 1.5. Then Reddit up 0.2.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我认为在我们进入财报季时，需要理解的另一件重要事情，并且总是要把它放在一个背景中来看，那就是 Robinhood 在 2023 年 12 月时股价是 7 美元，现在是 144 美元。它是整个 S&P 500 中表现最好的股票，因为他们在两个月前被纳入了 S&P 500。所以，恭喜所有股东，他们也进入了 S&P 500。所以，听着，如果股价真的下跌了 10%，那它就不是上涨 230%，而是上涨 225% 或 220%。到了这个地步，这些数字就变得有点像“好吧，它显然涨了很多”。对于我们这些重仓的人来说，这会对投资组合造成实质性影响，但这不是我们不能心存感激的。我只想看到公司继续执行。只要他们执行得好，我认为长期股东就会得到回报。如果你在赌财报，你得记住，我们有很多公司给出了非常好的数据，但很多利好已经被股价消化了，这意味着股价的走势不一定如你所愿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I think the other important thing to understand as we get into this earnings and just always to put some context into it, Robin Hood was $7 back in December of 2023. It is now 144. It is the best performing stock in the entire S&P 500 because they got in to the S&P 500 two months ago. So, congratulations to all shareholders on them getting into the S&P 500 as well. So, look, if the stock does take a dip and it goes down 10%, instead of being up 230%, it's up 225% or 220%. Like it's it's at at this point the numbers become kind of just like okay it's up a lot obviously and it's going to hurt materially portfolios that are have big positions to it like a lot of us do but it's not something we can't be grateful for. So I just want to see the company execute. As long as they execute I think long-term shareholders will be rewarded. If you are speculating on earnings you just got to remember we've had a lot of companies give really good numbers but a lot of it was priced in and that means the the earnings don't necessarily turn out the way you want in terms of stock price action.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，公司的长期愿景是我们三个人都关注的焦点。除非他们公布负数，否则这将有助于公司的长期发展，看到更多的用户更频繁地交易，增加他们在 Robinhood 上的总钱包份额。从我最近看到的一切来看，比如 Vlad Tenev 与特斯拉社区和 Open Door 社区的互动，他们只是在激励和吸引更多人来到这个平台。老实说，我认为这正在奏效。所以我认为第三季度会很好。我认为第四季度，除了可能出现的交易量不足之外，Robinhood 的市场份额增长实际上也会非常可观。但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: Yeah, the the long-term vision of the company is what I think all three of us are focused on. And unless they show negative numbers, it's going to help out the long-term vision of this company, seeing more members that are transacting more often, that are increasing their total share of wallet on Robin Hood. And from everything I'm seeing lately, like with Vlad Tennv's interaction with the Tesla community and the Open Door community, they only are incentivizing and wanting people more to come onto that platform. And I honestly think it's working. So I I think Q3 is going to be good. I think Q4, aside from the lack of trading volume that might end up showing up, I actually think Robin Hood will see an outsized amount of market share growth in Q4 as well. But we'll see.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，这是他们最后一个比较轻松的比较基期了。第四季度的比较基期会更困难。我认为他们会没事的，但这之后会更具挑战性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah, this this is the last pretty easy comp that they have. Q4 will be harder. I think they'll be fine, but it does get more challenging beyond this.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我认为在财报发布之际，另一件重要的事情是这些新产品的发展轨迹。正如 Roy 和 Tanner 所说，预测市场是一件大事。我想每个人都开始意识到，预测市场已经成为任何大型事件文化的一部分，无论是纽约市长选举还是体育赛事。所以，作为一个有朝一日可能成长为十亿美元业务的产品，我认为管理层谈论它会非常重要。信用卡现在大概有 45 万用户，候补名单上超过 300 万人。所以整个银行业生态系统很重要。我们九月份刚参加了 Hood 峰会，我们很多人在那里见到了你们。Cortex AI、Robin Hood Social。我的意思是，他们有很多不同的垂直领域，我认为他们已经为 2026 年做好了准备。所以，我也很好奇他们会如何谈论他们最新产品的增长，比如期货、指数期权，以及他们今年推出的所有不同产品，我认为超过 15 种。然后，这些将如何影响 2026 年的情况，无论市场是像超级碗一样火爆，还是平淡，甚至是熊市。他们如何为公司未来的发展定位？我认为这是很多人会关心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I think the other thing that's important going into earnings is the trajectory of these new products. So, as Roy and Tanner were talking about, prediction markets is a big deal. I think everyone is starting to realize that prediction markets are part of the culture of just any big event, whether it's the New York mayor election or sports events. So that as a as a product that can grow into a billion dollar business one day. I think that's going to be really important for management to talk about. Credit card now is like 450,000 people. I think over three million people on the wait list. So the whole banking ecosystem that's important. We just had hood summit in September. All of us got to meet a bunch of you guys there. Cortex AI, Robin Hood social. I mean there's a lot of different verticals I think they have ready to tap into for 2026. So, I would also be curious to see how they talk about the growth that of their latest products, futures, index options, all the different things they ship this year, which I think is well over 15 different products. And then how that bleeds into what's going to happen in 26 regardless of if it's a Super Bowl market or if it's, you know, casual or even if it's a bare market. How do they position the company going forward in the future? And I think that's what a lot of people will care about.</p>
</details>

Amit: 另外，这次财报电话会将在湾区现场举行。他们今天早上宣布，地点在蔡斯中心（Chase Stadium）。我不会去，我不在加州。我们都不在，但他们仍然会有一个现场的财报电话会议，所以看他们举办一场 NBA 新闻发布会式的财报会应该会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Also, it's going to be live in the Bay Area. They're doing it at the Chase Stadium. They announced it this morning. I will not be there. I'm not in California. None of us are, but they are still going to have a live earnings call and so it'll be fun to kind of see them do the NBA press conference type of earnings.</p>
</details>

Amit: 不太清楚为什么 Nvidia 在下跌。在我们即将收盘的时候，它正受到冲击。哇，Nvidia 下跌了 2%。我没看到任何头条新闻。Tanner，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Not sure why Nvidia is going down. It is getting hit right here as we get into the end of the day. Wow. One 2% down on Nvidia. I don't see any headline. Tanner, do you know?</p>
</details>

Tanner: 不，我没关注。我还是喜欢……当崩盘发生时，我就想，哦不，195了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: Uh no. No, I have not been following. I I still like while the crash is happening I'm like oh no 195.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，就是这样，对吧？这支股票在过去三周一直卡在 170 美元，现在我们却因为它从 200 跌到 195 而生气。这就像是年底的那个阶段，我们想在最后两个月里冲刺一下最终的数字，但如果这些股票没有以历史新高收盘也没关系。这不是什么坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, this is the thing, right? It's like this thing was stuck at 170 for the past three weeks and now we're mad it's from 200 to 195. It's just like it's that part of the end of the year where we're trying to get those final numbers in the last two months, but it's okay if these names don't end at alltime highs. It's not a horrible thing.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，我不太清楚为什么 Nvidia 今天会下跌，但我知道在 Palantir 财报后，有很多头条新闻说人工智能可能被过度炒作了，Palantir 因此下跌等等，因为他们有一个非常棒的季度。我看到这种情绪也传导到了其他几家人工智能公司，包括 Nvidia，我的意思是，它的股价跌到了大概一周前的水平。所以，哦不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: Yeah, I I I don't know exactly why Nvidia is falling today, but I I know with Palunteer afterwards there was a lot of headlines like that maybe AI is overhyped and Palanteer is falling as a result and everything because they had an amazing quarter and and I've seen that translate to several other A&Ms including uh Nvidia which I mean it's like levels not seen since like a week ago. So Oh no.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，当一只股票上涨时，情况就是这样。当它下跌时，即使它上涨可能是出于某种原因，它下跌也可能是出于某种原因。最终，我们必须消化这个事实。这里有一条关于谷歌的头条新闻非常重要。这是来自彭博社的。苹果正在敲定一项协议，每年向谷歌支付约 10 亿美元，将其 1.2 万亿参数的 Gemini AI 模型集成到 Siri 中。这将是一件大事。我们听到了很多关于苹果和谷歌合作的传闻。看起来苹果可能会选择 Gemini 而不是 ChatGPT，来为 Siri 的扩展建立一个有意义的框架。这就是为什么谷歌股价上涨了一点。但这进一步表明，这只在今年大部分时间里都停留在 150 美元的股票，最终还是表现出色。谷歌股价现在是 28 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. It's the thing about when a stock goes up, it's like, well, when it goes down, even if it was probably going up for whatever reason, it will go down for whatever reason. And ultimately, we have to digest that. There was a headline with Google right here that was really important. Uh, this is from Bloomberg. Apple is finalizing a deal to pay Google about 1 billion a year to integrate its 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini AI model into Siri. That would be a pretty big deal. We've heard a lot of rumors about Apple and Google working together. It looks like Apple's potentially going with Gemini over Chat GBT to really establish a meaningful framework for Siri to expand and uh that's why Google stocks up a little bit. But it just further goes to show that this stock that was stuck at 150 for the majority of the year really ended up working out. Google right there 28.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我在这里看到一条推文。Nvidia 股价在有报道称主要云服务提供商正在缩减 2025 年的 GPU 订单后暴跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: I'm seeing a tweet here. Nvidia tumbles after reports suggest major cloud providers are scaling back GPU orders for 2025.</p>
</details>

Amit: 哦，是的。是的。没错。就是那个。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. That that that exact thing.</p>
</details>

Roy: 好的。那是彭博社的报道。那条新闻足以导致股价下跌。我的意思是，那会是……等等。那……

<details>

<p class="english-text">Roy: Okay. That's the Bloomberg. That That would do it. I mean, that would be enough of a headline. Well, hold on. What about I</p>

Tanner: 顺便说一下，我读到的不是那个。我是在 X 上读到的。但标题完全一样。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tanner: And that's actually not what I read, by the way. I read something on X. So, exact same headline, by the way.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，有点奇怪，我只是在说，Nvidia 正在因为一条你认为会同时打击两家公司的新闻而下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. It's It's a little weird that I just pumping and Nvidia is falling on news that you would think would hit both of them. So,</p>
</details>

Roy: 或者 Nebius，对吧？是的。我的意思是，那会打击所有的数据中心公司。所以我不确定那是否准确。注意，主要云服务提供商正在缩减规模。新兴云服务商正在涌入，抢购所有这些 GPU。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: or a Nebius, right? Yeah. I mean, that would hit every data center play that's out there. So, I'm not sure if it's that accurate. Note major cloud providers scaling back. The neoclouds are coming in to to take all those GPUs.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，如果主要的云服务提供商不再购买任何 GPU，他们可能也不会给这些新兴云服务提供商提供这些交易。所以这肯定会对那些公司产生影响，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: Yeah. And and if the major cloud providers aren't buying any more GPUs, they might not be giving these deals to the NeoCloud providers. So it it has to have an impact on those guys, right?</p>
</details>

Amit: 问题是，我们已经看到太多这样的报道了。微软缩减规模，你知道，谷歌缩减规模。我们都见过这些。除非我从这些公司口中亲耳听到，否则我不会相信。“消息人士称”已经成为路透社和彭博社报道的假新闻的最大来源，我不相信。你知道，如果 Jensen 看到了一个发展路径，顺便说一下，在 2025 年缩减 GPU 采购，现在已经是 11 月了。我们在说什么？就像我们看到 Jensen 刚刚出来说未来六个季度有 5000 亿美元的增长空间。你觉得他们会说，“哦，你知道吗？我们现在就停止在 11 月和 12 月购买吧。”

<p class="english-text">Amit: Here's the thing. We've seen so many of these reports happen. Microsoft scaling back, you know, Google scaling back. We've seen all of this. Until I hear it from any of those companies mouths, I do not believe them. sources say has been the biggest source of fake news that has been reported on from Reuters and Bloomberg and all these I don't believe it. You know, if Jensen sees a pathway and by the way scaling back in 2020 or for GPU purchases in 2025, it's freaking November. What are we talking about? Like we've seen Jensen just come out and say there's $500 billion runway over the next six quarters. You think they're like, "Oh, you know what? Let's stop buying right now for November and December.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，是的。而且到目前为止，在财报季，整个财报季都是 Nvidia 的财报季，因为有大型科技公司谈论他们的资本支出扩张，而不是收缩。所以我更相信那些，而不是所谓的“消息人士”。不管这些消息人士是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah. Yeah. And and like so far in the earning season, like all the entire earning season is Nvidia's earning season just because you have major large cap tech that talk about their capital X expansion, not retraction. Uh so I would put a lot more credence in that versus sources. Whoever the sources are,</p>

### 财报公布：业绩远超预期

Amit: 好的，伙计们，我们来了。距离市场收盘还有 30 秒。再次感谢大家，我和 Roy、Tanner 都非常感激能和大家一起走过这段旅程。我们感谢你们在过去几年里一直关注我们的内容。Robinhood 改变了我们所有人的生活。我想它也改变了聊天室里很多人的生活。今天又是一个季度，我们得以见证公司的持续进步。11 月 5 日，星期三，下午 4 点。股市现已收盘。

And uh we just thank you for being along with us over the past couple years consuming the content. And Robin Hood has changed all of our lives. I imagine it's changed a lot of people's lives here in the chat. And today is another quarter where we get to see the company continue to progress. Wednesday, November 5th, 4 p.m. The stock market is now closed.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，我们来了。我们将在接下来的几分钟内得到结果。Tanner、Roy 和我将刷新我们的屏幕，看看我们能得到什么。再次提醒，我们关注的其他公司有：Duolingo、Applovin、Qualcomm、INQL、Fortnet、Door Dash、Joby、Lift、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Centric Energy、Anovix、Honest、Figma、Snap 和 Chime。这些都是……

<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, here we go. We will be getting results in the next couple of minutes. Tanner Roy and I will be refreshing our screens to see what we get. Again, the other companies that we have on deck, Dualingo, Apploving, Qualcomm, INQL, Fortnet, Door Dash, Joby, Lift, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, Centric Energy, Anovix, Honest, Figma, Snap, and Chime. So, those are also going to be all the companies</p>
</details>

Amit: 我们有高通。是的。高通调整后每股收益 3 美元，预期为 2.88 美元。这是一个超预期的业绩。营收 112.7 亿美元，预期为 107 亿美元。这也是超预期的。高通股价上涨。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: We have it. Yes. Qualcomm adjusted EPS uh $3 versus 288. That's a beat. Revenue 11.27 billion versus 10.7. That's a beat. Qualcomm is green.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的。高通。业绩超预期。所以，高通的营收和利润都超预期了。盘后股价下跌了 2%。但这是一个不错的超预期业绩。这是一个不错的超预期业绩。Duolingo，我知道这是一个备受关注的公司。它下跌了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: My bad. I was like "This guy muted me or something." I didn't mute you. I muted my own computer. That's the issue. Sorry. Uh, okay. Qualcomm. Uh, beats. So, Qualcomm, you got a beat top and the bottom. That stock after hours is down 2%. It's a good beat though. It's a good beat. Uh, Dualingo, I know that's a big one. That's down.</p>
</details>

Amit: Duolingo 下跌了。它曾下跌 5%，现在……不，现在仍然下跌 5%。嗯，它下跌了 3%。就像来回波动一样，你可以看到那里有一根小小的绿色蜡烛线。但它在盘后受到了冲击。高通，再次强调，他们的每股收益和营收都超出了预期。指引方面，他们预计在 3.30 到 3.50 之间，而市场预期是 3.26。这也是超预期的。营收预计在 118.8 亿到 126 亿之间。这也是超预期的。华尔街的预期是 115.9 亿。这是一个在指引、每股收益和营收方面全面的四重超预期，这相当不错。Hood，我们有结果了吗？有了吗？还没有。应该在两分钟内。我们就能拿到 Hood 的财报。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: It's down. It's trying to go up. Duolingo down. It was down five now. No, now it's that still down five. Well, it's down three. It's like going back and forth as you can see that little green candle right there. But that one is getting hit after hours. Qualcomm again, they did beat EPS. They did beat revenue. Uh guidance, they're doing 330 to 350 estimates was 326. That's also a beat. And uh revenue 11.8 8 to 12.6. That's also a beat. Street wanted at 11.59. That's a that's a quadruple beat across the board on guidance, EPS, and revenue, which is not too bad. Hood, do we have it yet? Do we have it? Not yet. Should be in two minutes. We get Hood.</p>
</details>

Amit: 哦，Robinhood 下跌了。Robinhood 下跌了。那里有一根红色蜡烛线。我们立刻看到了一根红色蜡烛线。然后现在这根红色蜡烛线……它从 140 跌到了 137 一秒钟。再次强调，特朗普曾说过他不想卖那些 Nvidia 芯片。所以这可能是 Jensen 对中国说那番话的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Oh, Robin is down. Robin is down. There's a red candle right there. We got a red candle immediately. Then it's now the red candle's not it went from 140 to 137 for a second again. Trump kind of said that he didn't want to sell those in video chips. So that's why Jensen probably said that about China.</p>

Tanner: 又一次。我不知道他们是怎么做到的，伙计。股价可以随心所欲地波动。天哪，兄弟。我的天哪。营收环比增长 29%。兄弟，我们以为他们很难达到 12 亿，结果是 12.74 亿。我的天哪。

</details>

Amit: 再一次，当你看到这样的数字时，你必须超越股价本身，然后感叹，天哪，61 美分对比……这意味着他们的运营杠杆可能在本季度变得更好了，这已经是连续第八个季度了。

### 深度解读：创纪录的季度业绩

Amit: 好的，让我来报道一下 Hood。我想我这里有。让我把这个调出来，然后我们试着拿到实际的幻灯片和数据。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh, okay, let me get some coverage on Hood. I think I got this right here. Let me pull this up and then we'll try to get the actual slides and the numbers.</p>
</details>

CNBC: 公布的每股收益为 61 美分，高于分析师预期的 53 美分，营收为 12.7 亿美元，高于预期的 11.9 亿美元。基于交易的营收略低于预期，为 7.3 亿美元，尽管股票和期权交易量创下纪录，但这一缺口被净利息收入的强劲增长所抵消。现在，有资金的账户也略低于预期，为 2688 万。与此同时，高管层发生变动。新的**CFO**（Chief Financial Officer: 首席财务官）Shiv Verma 将接替 Jason Warick。我刚才和他们俩都谈过了。他们指出预测市场是一个主要的……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CNBC: Posted earnings of 61 cents a share above the 53 cents that analysts expected and revenue of 1.27 billion versus the 1.19 billion estimate. transaction-based revenue that was a little bit light at 730 million despite record trading volume in equities and options but that shortfall was offset by strong gains in net interest income. Now funded accounts also a slight miss at 26.8 8 million. Meanwhile, a seauite shakeup. New CFO Shiv Verma is taking over for Jason Warick. I spoke to them both moments ago. They pointed to prediction markets as a major.</p>
</details>

Amit: 这可能是原因，华尔街喜欢 Jason Warick。他卸任不是坏事，但如果他因为任何原因卸任，我们总是会看到华尔街在高管变动时出现膝跳反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: That could be the reason the street likes Jason Warick. It's not a bad thing that he's stepping down, but if he is stepping down for whatever reason he is. We always see knee-jerk reactions by the street when there's a seauite shakeup.</p>
</details>

CNBC: 亮点，称其为有史以来增长最快的业务。第三季度合约量比第二季度翻了一番。仅在 10 月份，他们的交易量就超过了整个上一季度。他们说……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CNBC: Bright spot calling it their fastest growing business ever. Contract volume doubled in Q3 versus the second quarter. And in October alone, they saw more trading than the entire prior quarter. They say that</p>
</details>

Amit: 仅在十月份，他们的交易量就超过了整个季度。我的意思是，这将为第四季度打下坚实的基础，同时这也将是一个难以超越的比较基准。天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: in October alone, they saw more trading than the entire quarter. I mean, that's going to be they're setting up for a strong Q4 and that's going to be a hard comp to beat as well. Goodness.</p>
</details>

CNBC: 进入第四季度的势头强劲，客户存款和活动创下纪录。不过，这些股票现在下跌了超过 4.5%。Morgan。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CNBC: Momentum is strong heading into Q4 with record customer deposits and activity. Those shares though more than four and a half% lower now. Morgan.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，让我来读一下这个。我们来了。营收同比增长 100%，达到 12.7 亿美元。净存款创纪录地达到了 200 亿美元。天哪，我想他们最多也就做过 130 亿。我的天哪，净存款增加了 70 亿。Robinhood Gold 订阅用户创纪录地达到了 390 万。每股收益 61 美分。Robinhood 现在有 11 个业务线，年化收入达到或超过 1 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Let me read through this. Here we go. Revenue up 100% year-over-year. 1.27 billion. Net deposits were record 20 billion. Dude, I think the most they've ever done is 13 billion. Oh my god. 7 billion increase on net deposits. Robin Hood Gold subscribers record 3.9 million. EPS 61 cents. Robin and now to 11 business lines generating 100 more million or more in annualized revenues.</p>
</details>

Amit: Vlad 说：“我们团队不懈的产品迭代速度在第三季度推动了创纪录的业务成果，而且我们没有放慢脚步。预测市场正在迅速增长，Robinhood Banking 开始推出，Robinhood Ventures 也即将到来。”“第三季度是又一个盈利增长强劲的季度，我们继续多元化我们的业务，增加了两个或更多的业务线，预测市场和 Bitstamp，它们正在产生约 1 亿美元或更多的年化收入。第四季度在 10 月份开局强劲，股票、期权、预测市场和期货的月度交易量创下纪录，保证金余额也创下新高。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Here we go. Our team's relentless product velocity drove record business results in Q3 and we're not slowing down. Prediction markets growing rapidly. Robin Banking is starting to roll out and Robin Adventures is coming, said Vlad. Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth and we continue to diversify our business adding two or more business lines, prediction markets in Bitstamp that are generating approximately 100 million or more in annualized revenues. And Q4 is off to a strong start in October with record monthly trading volumes across equities, options, prediction markets, and futures and new highs for margin balances.</p>
</details>

Amit: 净营收再次达到 12.7 亿美元。交易收入 7.3 亿。净利息收入 4.56 亿。我想这是他们有史以来最高的，或者接近最高。其他收入 8800 万。净收入 5.56 亿美元。所以在 12.7 亿美元中，有 5.56 亿是纯利润。调整后的 **EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 息税折旧及摊销前利润）为 1.77 亿美元。有资金的客户为 2680 万。资产 3330 亿。这相当可观。净存款 204 亿。再次强调，这简直令人难以置信。**ARPU**（Average Revenue Per User: 每用户平均收入）为 191 美元。黄金订阅用户增加了近 200 万，总数达到 390 万。他们有 43 亿美元现金。他们以 104 美元的价格回购了 100 万股自家股票。所以他们花了 1.07 亿美元回购股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh net revenues again 1.27 billion. Transaction 730. Net interest 456. I think that's their highest ever or close to their highest. Other revenues 88 million. Uh net income 556 million. So 556 out of the 1.27 billion was pure profit. Um adjusted eBay 177% funded customers 26.8 million. Assets 333 billion. It's pretty big. Net deposits 20.4. Again, that is just incredible. Arpoo is at 191 a user. Gold subscribers up by almost 2 million, 3.9 million total. They have 4.3 billion in cash. They bought a million shares of their stock at a 104. So, they spent 107 million buying their stock.</p>
</details>

Amit: 10 月份净存款为 55 亿美元，保证金增长 150% 至 160 亿美元，这与我们从 **FINRA**（Financial Industry Regulatory Authority: 金融业监管局）听到的情况类似，即保证金贷款在所有券商中都处于历史最高水平。股票交易量 3200 亿。我好像从没见过一个月内有 3200 亿这个数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: October net deposits were 5 a.5 billion margin up 150% to 16 billion which is similar to what we've heard from uh FINRA right that that and margin loans are at their highest levels ever across every brokerage equity volumes 320 billion.

Amit: 我不认为我们见过这个数字。期权，伙计们，2.6 亿。我想我们见过的最多的是 1.95 亿。加密货币交易量 320 亿。而且 10 月份加密市场表现不佳。比特币和以太坊的表现都不是最好的。所以这太不可思议了。

</details>

Amit: 好的，就是这样。CFO Jason Warick 宣布打算明年退休。Jason 将在第一季度从 CFO 的职位上过渡，并担任战略顾问。这可能是股价下跌的原因，仅仅因为 CFO 要退休了。但情况就是这样。Roy，你对这些数字的初步看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, that's what you got. A CFO Jason Warick announces intention to retire next year. Jason will transition from his role as CFO in Q1 and be a strategic adviser. That could be why the stock is dumping just that the CFO is retiring. But that's what you got. Uh Roy, your kind of raw thoughts on these numbers.</p>
</details>

Roy: 我的意思是，是的，太荒谬了。分析师和我们的期望都很高，但他们仍然超出了预期。这是一家在基本面上执行力极强的公司，火力全开。未来也有很多增长杠杆，我同意你的看法，可能很多利好已经被股价消化了，你可能被定价为完美，也许情况就是这样，但当一家公司的 CFO 离职时，股价出现下跌并不罕见。我实际上看到这种情况比 CEO 离职时更常见，因为 CFO 是一个关键角色，有时——虽然 Robinhood 不会是这种情况——人们会想，“哦，他们要走了，所以肯定有什么非常糟糕的事情要发生了。”嗯，我不认为情况是这样。我认为这一直是计划的一部分。Jason 很棒。我祝愿他未来一切顺利。但是，是的，这是一个非常有才华的团队，所以那里没什么可担心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: I mean, yeah, ridiculous. Uh we expectations were high from analysts and also from us and they they still beat it. Uh this is a company that executes fundamentally their fire on all cylinders. Um a lot of future growth levers too and I agree with you like that probably you know maybe it's some of it a lot of it was priced in u you could be priced to perfection and maybe that's the case but it's not uncommon when the CFO of a company leaves that there is a dip afterwards. I I've actually seen that more often than when the CEO leaves just because CFO is a critical role and sometimes which will not be the case for Robin Hood. There's people like, "Oh, they're leaving so it must be something that's really bad that's out there." Well, I don't think that's the case. I think this has always been the plan. Jason's amazing. Um, and I wish him well in whatever he has in the future. But, uh, yeah, it's a very talented group, so no concerns there.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: That is the highest I've ever seen. Wow. There you go. 131.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，它击败了 Nvidia。它击败了 Palantir。而这两家公司都有惊人的数据。顺便说一下，基于交易的收入和净利息收入也创下了历史新高。而且其他收入也接近历史新高。所以，相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah, it beats Nvidia. It beats uh Palunteer. And those both have insane numbers. And And by the way, all-time high uh on uh transactionbased revenues and net interest revenues as well. um and nearly the all-time high on other revenues. So, pretty good.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，所以交易收入是 7.3 亿，其中股票 2.68 亿，期权 3.04 亿，加密货币 2.68 亿。所以这仍然是一个非常好的季度。这看起来是他们有史以来最高的交易收入。是的，历史最高。其他利息收入 7200 万，净利息收入创下新高，我想。是的，这是他们第一次突破 4 亿。信用卡业务 1700 万，现金管理 6400 万，保证金。看那个，兄弟。保证金从 1.14 亿增长到 1.53 亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, so transaction 730 they did 268 in equity, 304 options, 86 in uh or 86 in equity, 304 in options, 268 in crypto. So, it's still a really good quarter quarter. This is their highest they've ever done in transactions, it looks like. Uh yeah, highest ever. 72 million in other interest, net interest high, I think. Yeah, it's first time they broke 400. Credit card did 17 cash sweep 64 margin. Look at that dude. 114 to 153 on margin.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，我们当然看到了 10 月份的数据，但前两个月的保证金增长简直是疯了。我们在其他平台上也看到了这种情况，但 Robinhood 做得非常好。他们大约一年前的想法，他们说我们要降低利率。所以，我们要降低这些利率来获得市场份额。他们做到了。顺便说一下，第 13 页有一张关于市场份额的幻灯片，也非常酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah, we saw u of course we see the October numbers now, but like the the prior two months were just insane margin acceleration. We're seeing that on other platforms too, but Robin Hood is killing it. And their their idea to uh like I think it was a year ago where they said we're going to take lower rates. So, we're going to lower these rates and gain market share. They've done that. By the way, there is a market share slide on slide 13, which is really cool, too.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，那张幻灯片很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, that is a great slide.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，所以股票市场份额，他们估计占有市场的 1.07%。加密货币市场份额，他们有 1.08%，增长了 100%。股票业务增长了 138%。这是过去三年从 22 年开始的数据。期权业务占 7.5%，增长了 68%。保证金业务不到 1%，但增长了 55%。这意味着所有这些业务都还没有真正渗透市场。而这就是 Robinhood 的增长故事。我的意思是，如果这些业务在未来十年内都达到 10% 的市场份额，我觉得这还是非常保守的估计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, so equities market share, they're estimating they have 1.07% of the market. Uh crypto market share, they have 1.08, which is up 100%. Equities up 138%. This is over the past three years from 22. Options 7 and a half% that's up 68%. margin less than 1% but that's up 55%. Which means all of these are not really penetrated yet. And that's the growth story on Robin Hood. I mean if the if these all get to like 10% over the next decade and I feel like that's being very conservative to be honest like</p>

Vlad Tenev: 首先，对于活跃交易者，我们在第三季度创下了股票和期权交易量的纪录。保证金账户余额在过去 18 个月里增长了三倍，创下历史新高。我们的预测市场正在飞速发展，仅在第三季度就交易了超过 20 亿份事件合约。不仅如此，10 月份的规模更大，超过了整个第三季度的总和。我们还增加了职业和大学橄榄球、娱乐、政治、经济、科技等领域的合约。这正在成为一个全面的产品，不仅为交易者服务，也成为一个全新的信息来源。

<p class="english-text">Vlad Tenev: First, for active traders, we set records for equity and options trading volumes in Q3. Margin account balances tripled over the past 18 months to a record high. And our prediction markets are ripping with over two billion event contracts traded in Q3 alone. Not only that, October was even bigger, bigger than all of Q3 combined. And we've added contracts for pro and college football, entertainment, politics, economics, technology, and so much more. This is really becoming a comprehensive offering, not just for traders, but also brand new source of information.</p>

Vlad Tenev: 第二，在钱包份额方面，我们希望成为您的主要和次要金融账户，并且我们正在取得很大进展。我们看到平台总资产势头强劲，现在有三分之一万亿美元的资产存放在 Robinhood。客户们非常喜欢我们的长期投资产品，Robinhood Retirement 和 Robinhood Strategies 的增长都非常出色。此外，我们正在迅速向更多客户发放金卡，并且我们也已经开始推出 Robinhood Banking。

<p class="english-text">Vlad Tenev: All right. Second, on the wallet share front, we want to be your primary and secondary financial account, and we're making a lot of progress. We're seeing strong momentum in total platform assets with a third of a trillion dollars now held at Robin Hood. Customers are loving our long-term investing products, both Robin Hood Retirement and Robin Hood Strategies ramping up super nicely. Plus, we're rapidly shipping gold cards to more customers, and we've begun the roll out for Robin Hood banking as well.</p>
</details>

Vlad Tenev: 第三，最后但同样重要的是，我们正在全球范围内扩张，以建立全球第一的金融生态系统。**通证化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的权利转换为区块链上的数字代币的过程）是我们全球扩张的一大助推器。你可能会在我们欧洲活动的黑板上看到，我们正在继续执行我们的路线图，我们将向客户提供的股票代币数量增加了一倍多。我们还推出了永续期货，在美国，我们很高兴能通过 Robinhood Ventures 让散户股东接触到私营公司。未来还有更多。

<p class="english-text">Vlad Tenev: Third, last but not least, we're expanding globally as we build the number one global financial ecosystem. Tokenization has been a big accelerant to our global expansion. And you might see in this chalkboard here from our European event in Europe. We're continuing to execute on our roadmap and we more than doubled the number of stock tokens available to our customers. We also rolled out perpetual futures and in the US we're excited to bring access to private companies to retail shareholders through Robin Hood Ventures. Plenty more to come there.</p>

### 电话会问答环节精选

Amit: 嘿，Vlad。嘿，Jason。谢谢你们接受我的提问。也非常感谢 Jason 多年来的执行力，并祝贺你，Shiv，担任新角色。我的问题是给你的，Vlad。回到通证化的话题，你最近说通证化将吞噬更广泛的金融体系。除了通证化的股票，你能否给我们一个更宏观的视角，看看这个机会有多大？为什么现在是去追求它的时机？以及 Robinhood 在未来几年里，在利用这个机会方面有什么真正的想法？我知道除了股票，还有很多其他不同的资产可以被通证化。所以你能否多谈谈你们是如何看待这个机会的？

<p class="english-text">Amit: Hey Vlad. Hey Jason. Thank you guys for uh taking my question and a big thank you Jason over the years on your execution and congrats to you Shiv on your new role. Um, my question is for you, Vlad. Going back to tokenization, you recently said tokenization will eat the broader financial system. Outside of just tokenized equities, can you give us a more larger look on how big of a size the opportunity is? Why right now is the time to go after it and what Robin is really thinking about over the next couple of years in terms of taking advantage of the opportunity. I know there's a lot of different other assets besides equities that could be tokenized. So can you just speak a little bit more on how you guys are thinking of the opportunity?</p>
</details>

Vlad Tenev: 是的，我认为这个机会非常令人兴奋。我认为传统加密货币既是问题也是机遇的一点是，直到最近，加密货币和传统金融体系一直是两个独立的世界。我认为 Robinhood 作为一个规模化的加密业务，同时也是一个规模化的传统金融业务，拥有独特的地位来连接这两者，并为我们认为是传统资产，但实际上是像证券这样具有真正基础效用的产品，利用区块链技术并在链上进行交易创造空间。客户可以自我托管，他们可以与各种协议互动，进行抵押借贷，这些资产可以 24/7 实时以零散数量进行交易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Vlad Tenev: Yeah, I think that the opportunity is very exciting. One of the things that um I think is both a problem and an opportunity with uh traditional crypto is that crypto and the traditional financial system up until fairly recently have kind of been two separate worlds. And I think Robin Hood has a unique position as a scaled crypto business, but also a scaled business in traditional finance to bridge the two and actually make room for uh what we consider traditional assets, but really things like securities, uh products with real fundamental utility to leverage blockchain technology and actually be tradable onchain. uh where customers can self-custody, they can engage with a variety of protocols, collateralize borrowing and and lending and where those assets can be traded 24/7 real time in fractional quantities.</p>
</details>

Vlad Tenev: 我个人感到兴奋的其他机会是房地产、私人信贷、独特的资产和收藏品，比如艺术品。如果你想一想，如果你是一个高净值人士，你的投资组合中有什么，有很多这样的资产实际上是散户目前无法接触到的。我认为通证化是一种能够大规模实现这一点的方式，并且在某种程度上减少了通常与持有这些资产相关的缺点，比如缺乏流动性、被锁定在头寸中、无法将资产分块投资等。所以，这就是我们继续推动它的原因，无论是在美国还是在国外。你应该会看到，在未来几年里，这个领域会变得越来越大，当然，从我们认为潜力最大、也离我们最近的资产类别——股票开始。

<p class="english-text">Vlad Tenev: The other opportunities that I'm personally excited about is uh real estate, private credit, uh, unique assets and collectibles like art. Um, if you think about, you know, what what's a a part of your portfolio if you're a high- netw worth individual, there's a lot of these assets that actually retail can't access currently. And I think that tokenization is a way to enable that at scale uh and sort of like reduce some of the downsides that would would typically be associated with holding those assets like lack of liquidity, being locked into positions, not being able to like chunk the assets out and and invest in portions of them. So, uh, that's why we're continuing to push on it, um, both in the US and and outside. And you should expect this to become bigger and bigger, uh, in the coming years, of course, starting with stocks, which is uh, the asset class that we think has the most potential and we're also closest to.</p>

### 最终分析：一家“世代传承”的公司

Tanner: 这又是一次完胜。这是一家完全差异化的企业。他们真正展示了他们比竞争对手做得更好。131% 的 40 法则，市场份额增长，运营费用在增加，但远慢于我们看到的实际收入增长。他们还有什么做不到的？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tanner: this is another just slam. Like this is a completely differentiated business. They really are showing off that they are doing things better than their competitors. 131% rule of 40 market share growth increasing operating expenses but much slower than what we're seeing from actual revenue. What can't they do?</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，你现在能听到我说话吗？

<p class="english-text">Roy: Yeah. And you guys can hear me now?</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah.</p>
</details>

Roy: 好的。奇怪。是的，Streamyard。你知道，这是一个荒谬的、惊人的季度。而且很难找到弱点。你必须非常仔细地寻找。这家公司仍然是周期性的，但他们在所有方面都执行得很好。我也非常喜欢你的问题，Tanner，以及其中的请求。我知道其中一部分是我的问题，但是，是的，你可以问任何问题。好吧，实际上，不是每个人都知道这个。我们基本上可以问任何我们想问的问题。所有其他分析师也是如此。他们会回答，你知道，有时我不得不，你知道，缓和一下，但他们回答得非常透明。我喜欢这一点。我喜欢他们关于透明度的评论。就像 Vlad 说的，那些结束语不仅仅是夸张。如果我们没有看到执行力，也许会是，但这家公司以极高的节奏和卓越的水平执行。他们还进行收购，就像他们做的每件事都对一样。Amit，你说得对，它未来会成为一家万亿美元的公司。可能需要 10 年才能达到，但也可能不需要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy: Okay. Weird. Yeah. Streamyard. Yeah. you know, just a ridiculous amazing quarter. Uh, and just it's hard to find weak spots. Like, you have to really look. Uh, this company is cyclical still, but they're executing on all cylinders. I also really love I loved your question, by the way, Tanner, and the request that was in there. I know part of it was my question, but uh yeah, just uh you can ask anything like okay, actually, not everybody knows this. We we basically get to ask anything that we want. Same with all the other analysts and everything. And they answer, you know, sometimes I have to, you know, tone it down, but they answer very transparently. I love that. I love, you know, the comments on transparency. Um, and like Vlad said, like those end comments, it's not just hyperbole. If, if we had not seen the execution, maybe it would be, but this is a company that executes at an incredibly high cadence uh, and with excellence and they do acquisitions like they're just doing like everything right. This is emit, you're right, it is a$1 trillion dollar company in the future. It may take 10 years to get there, but maybe not.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的。我的意思是，看，如果我们在 26 年遇到熊市或者我们遇到回调，这是不可避免的，你总会在市场中遇到某种程度的回调，这就像是首选购买的股票之一。就是这样。我的意思是，就像，你知道，每当你考虑卖出或减持头寸时，每个人都可以出于个人原因卖出或减持或做任何他们需要做的事情，然后你听到像这样的电话会议，忘了财报结果。你只听到管理层谈论业务发展轨迹的质量。这会提醒你几件事。第一，它提醒你创业是艰难的。任何创过业的人都知道这有多难。它提醒你，扩大和发展业务更难。你可以创办一家企业，但要让它多年来持续复合增长是非常困难的。然后第三，它提醒你，世界上能以 90% 或 100%（我应该说是 Robinhood）的速度增长的企业是多么少。现在，这种情况不会永远持续下去，但关键是，你真的会问自己，那些公司在哪里？而且它们并不多。可能只有 20 到 30 家是上市公司。因此，它位居榜首。你知道，关于这个管理团队的一件事是，你可以信任他们。你真的可以信任他们。这对我来说是最重要的组成部分之一。你能信任管理层吗？我认为我们真的可以信任 Vlad 和他们的执行方式。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. I mean, look, if we get a bearish market in 26 or we get a correction, which inevitably you have some type of pullback in the market, this is like it's on the top list of stocks to buy. It just is. I mean, it's like, you know, and whenever you think of selling or trimming the position, and everyone can sell or trim or do whatever they need to do for for personal reasons, and then you hear a call like this, forget the results. You just hear the quality of how management is talking about the trajectory of a business. It reminds you a couple things. Number one, it reminds you that building a business is hard. And anyone who's ever built a business knows how hard it is. It reminds you that scaling and growing the business is even harder. You can make a business, but then actually getting it to compound over years is is very difficult. And then number three, it reminds you how few businesses that are out there in the world that are actually scaling at 90% or 100% I should say for Robin Hood. year-over-year. Now, that's not going to happen forever, but the point is you really ask yourself, where are those companies? And there's not many of them. There's maybe 20 to 30 of them that are public. And as a result, it's on the top list. And you know, the one thing about this management team is you can trust them. You really can trust them. That's one of the biggest components for me. Can you trust management? I think we can really trust Vlad and and how they're executing.</p>

Tanner: 我做了计算，现在我们有了 Bitstamp 的数据。我之前把它算进了加密货币里。所以加密货币的抽成率没有上涨 10 个基点。那是包括 Bitstamp 在内的。但它确实上涨了 6 个基点。所以在 Robinhood 应用上的加密货币抽成率是 63 个基点。然后在 Bitstamp 上，我们是 0.04%。所以远低于你在 Robinhood 上看到的，因为这显然主要是机构费率。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tanner: Um, I did the uh math now once we have the bitstamp numbers. Um I was counting it into the crypto. So crypto didn't jump up 10 basis points. That would be including Bitstamp. Uh but it did jump up six basis points. So it's 63 on just Robin Hood app crypto. And then on Bitstamp we're doing 0.04%. So much lower um than what you're seeing on Robin Hood because obviously this is institutional rates for the most part.</p>
