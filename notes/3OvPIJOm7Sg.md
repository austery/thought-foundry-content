### 财报前瞻与市场预期

好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Robinhood 财报解读。这是 2025 年第三季度的财报。非常高兴能和大家在这里相聚。和我一起的还有两位在过去几年里与我并肩前行的人，能和朋友 Roy 和 Tanner 一起经历这段旅程，我感到非常有意义。你们好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another edition of Robin Hood Earnings. This is Q3 2025. Very excited to be here with everybody. I'm here with two people that have been on the journey with me over the past couple years and it has been very rewarding to be on this journey with friends Roy and Tanner. How you guys doing?</p>
</details>

>> 我很好。是的，我很兴奋。这是我最大的持仓。无论结果如何我都不担心。这是一家了不起的公司，执行力惊人。股价也涨了很多。我们知道财报会很好。问题是到底有多好，以及市场会作何反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Doing great. Yeah, I'm excited. my largest position. Not worried either way. Amazing company, amazing execution. Stock is way up. Um, we know it's going to be good. The question is how good and how will the market react. So,</p>
</details>

>> 是的，兄弟。我真的非常兴奋，不仅想看 Hood 会交出怎样的成绩单，还觉得这次的问答环节会非常有趣。他们这次进入了很多新市场：信用卡、预测市场、银行业务。他们可以用一些我认为可能对股价有实质性推动作用的方式来回答问题。除此之外，今天还有很多其他令人兴奋的公司发布财报。我想我们会一边听 Hood 的电话会议，一边关注那边的几个问题。但总的来说，今天将会是非常忙碌的一天。所以，应该会很刺激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah. Yeah, dude. I I'm really freaking excited uh to see not only what Hood is going to put up, but a lot of the Q&A this time around, I also think is going to be really interesting. They're entering so many new markets this time around. credit cards, prediction markets, banking, they can really uh answer things in ways that I think could be um you know material to push the stock. Aside from that, there's actually a lot of other companies that are pretty exciting that are also reporting today. I think we'll be listening into the hood call and and having a couple questions there. But, uh today in general is going to be a very jam-packed day. So, so should be exciting.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。所以我们不仅有 Hood，还有 Duolingo、Applovin、Qualcomm、NQ、Elf、Fortinet、DoorDash、Joby、Lyft、Dutch Bros、HubSpot、Centric Energy、Anovix、Honest、Figma，可能还有一些我漏掉的。我们将在 4:05 拿到 Hood 的业绩。我们会花大约 20 到 25 分钟分析和解读这些结果，然后我们会关注几乎所有其他股票。上次我们这么做的时候，有 Hood、微软和 Meta。那两个也是需要重点关注的大公司。但如果你持有任何其他提到的股票，我们会在分析完 Hood 后立即尝试覆盖它们。如果有什么股票出现大幅上涨或下跌，我们可能会在中间插播一下。但我们会确保先完成对 Hood 的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, not only do we have Hood, we have Dualingo, Apploving, Qualcomm, NQ, Elf, Forinet, Door Dash, Joby, Lyft, Dutch Bros, HubSpot, Centric, Energy, Anovix, Honest, Figma, and probably a couple others that I'm missing. So, we're going to get the results on Hood at 405. Uh, we're going to try to analyze the results at least for about 20 25 minutes and kind of break them down and then we're going to get to pretty much every other stock. Last time we did this, we had Hood, Microsoft, and Meta. So, those were two big names to pay attention to. But if you're in any of the other names, we will try to get the coverage immediately right after we get Hood. If there's like a big mover up or down, uh we'll probably call it out in the middle of it. But we are going to see if we can get that Hood coverage.</p>
</details>

>> 市场普遍预期营收为 12.2 亿美元。一些分析师预测是 12 亿，另一些是 12.2 亿。所以可能有点混乱，上次也发生了类似的情况，关于确切的预期营收数字有点不一致，但这个数字已经上调了。最初是 10.1 亿，所以已经上调了大约 2 亿美元，**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，是衡量公司盈利能力的重要指标）为 54 美分。我会在聊天区发起一个“涨还是跌”的投票。很明显，在财报发布前，股价已经上涨了约 5%。Tanner，我们从你开始。你认为股价会怎么走？你觉得他们会在营收和利润上都超出预期吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, the street is expecting 1.22 billion in revenue. Some analysts have 1.2, others have 1.22. So, might be a little, this happened last time, a little bit of confusion on exactly what the expected revenue number is, but it has gone up. Originally, it was 1.01. So, it's gone up by about 200 million and 54 cents of EPS. I'm going to do the pump or dump poll in the chat. Obviously, the stock is moving going into the print, up about 5%. Uh, Tanner, we'll start with you. What do you think happens to the stock? And do you think they beat on the top and the bottom line?</p>
</details>

>> 我的预测是 12 亿美元，略低于华尔街的预期。然后我的预测也比较保守。有一些因素我没有考虑进去。所以我也许会和华尔街的预测非常接近。我预测的每股收益是 55 美分。我之所以和华尔街的预测如此接近，是因为我们对这只股票几乎不需要做什么猜测。我的意思是，除了大约三个交易日，我们已经看到了过去三个月他们所有的交易量数据。所以这就是为什么市场共识会非常集中。我们唯一不知道的是业务的**抽成率**（Take Rate: 指平台或公司从每笔交易中收取的费用或佣金的百分比）以及其他一些小事，比如事件合约及其影响。但即便如此，他们也向我们展示了细节，比如第三季度交易了 20 亿份期权合约，以及所有这些不同的细节。所以我不知道，伙计，我希望他们能带来一个巨大的惊喜，超出盈利预期。也许是 Bitstamp，也许是信用卡的交易量超出了人们的预期。但在季度报告发布前就公布了所有信息的情况下，这只股票很难带来惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I have uh $1.2 billion, which is just slight of what Wall Street's expecting. And then I also have which is also conservative. There's a couple things that I don't have baked in. So, I might be right in line with Wall Street there. And I've got 55 cents of EPS. Now, the reason why I'm so close to Wall Street is because there's very little guessing that we have to do on this name. I mean, we've seen all of the volume that they've seen over the past 3 months, aside from like three trading days. So, this is why consensus is going to be very tight. The only thing that we don't know is the take rate on the business and and other small things like event contracts and what that means. But um even then they've shown us details of you know two billion options contracts traded during uh Q3 and you know all this different details. So I don't know man I'm I'm hopeful that they just come out with a large surprise and beat earnings. Maybe Bitstamp maybe uh credit card seeing more transactions than people expect. But it's very hard to surprise on this name whenever you give all of your information before the quarter is even released.</p>
</details>

>> 同意。Roy，你对股价的反应有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Agreed. Roy, your thoughts on uh how you think the stock will react?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，如果出现回调我不会感到惊讶，因为我们已经涨得很猛了。今天市场表现好一些，但还是有些疲软，而且对于那些涨幅很大的股票，即使财报非常好，也往往会遭遇抛售。过去几周我们已经看到了这种情况。所以，如果发生这种情况，我的意思是，这是我最大的持仓，但我心态很好。我对公司的执行力非常满意和高兴。而且，就像 Tanner 说的，上行惊喜的机会比较小，但我想反驳你的一点，你说事件合约是小事，但预测市场并不是小事，尤其是在 Robinhood 的叙事中。所以我认为这将是本季度的重中之重。额外的惊喜也可能来自股票借贷业务，上次我们看到了一个巨大的惊喜，他们对此发表了一些评论。当然还有新的收购，你提到了 Bitstamp，还有 Trade PMR。保证金利率，我们不知道上个月的数据。我们知道前两个月的，那简直是疯狂。当然，还有国际扩张。所以，任何事情都有可能发生。很多情况是已知的。我们知道财报会很好，问题是到底有多好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback just because we've been running hard. The markets doing a little bit better today, but there is some weakness on it and it tends to sell off even very good earnings for names that have risen a lot. Um we've seen that over the last couple of weeks. So, you know, if that happens, I mean, it's my largest position, but I'm sitting pretty. Um I'm I'm very happy and pleased with the execution. And there there is a you know like like Tanner said there's less opportunity for surprise on the upside but I I would push back on one thing you you said small things like event contracts uh predictions market is not a small thing especially in the narrative that is Robin Hood and so I think that that's going to be paramount uh this quarter additional surprises could also come from stock lending we saw a huge surprise they had some commentary on it last time of course the uh the new acquisitions you mentioned bitstamp but also trade PMR uh margin rates we don't know those for the previous month. We do for the first two and they were absolutely ridiculous. And of course, international expansion. So, um, anything can happen. A lot's known. We know it's going to be good. The question is how good.</p>
</details>

>> 我之所以说它小，是因为我想我们甚至看到了第三季度交易了多少合约。大概是，你知道的，20 亿份合约，这大约能带来 2000 万美元的收入。这大概是我们预期收入的 1%。所以我确实期望它们会增长，我只是说在本季度，它不会那么重要。仅此而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The the only reason why I said small is because I think we even seen how many contracts were traded in Q3. It was something like, you know, uh, 2 billion contracts, whatever, which roughly comes out to $20 million. That's roughly like 1% of the revenue of what we're expecting. So like I am expecting them to grow. I just mean in this quarter it's not going to be that material. That's all.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我的想法是，市场是向前看的，你会看到，我认为大部分问题，甚至我们自己的一些问题，都会集中在预测市场上。那是一个正在迅速加速的、强劲的未来增长驱动力。我认为这可能取决于他们如何报告以及他们会说什么，当然他们也可能发布 10 月份的数据。我们以前见过他们这样做，但这将是推动未来股价的重要部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and my thought is just the market's forwardlooking and you'll see I think we'll see most questions maybe even some of our questions too on uh the predictions market. That's that's a future a strong future growth driver that's accelerating rapidly. Um and I think that's probably depending on of course how they report that and what they say as far as of course they also might release October numbers too. uh we've seen them do that before, but uh that's going to be a big part of what drives I think the stock in the future.</p>
</details>

### Robinhood 股价表现与市场背景

>> 隐含的波动率是 7%。我想这个隐含波动率是在今天上涨 5% 之前计算的，你知道，这让财报季有时像一场赌博，因为你永远不知道结果会怎样。Nvidia 在收盘前出现了一波抛售。Applovin 的隐含波动率为 10%，ARM 7%，DoorDash 8%，Snapchat 13%，ONQ 9.3%，然后是 Figma，作为上市公司，这是他们的第二个季度，隐含波动率也是 13%。Nvidia 正在下跌。特斯拉在明天的股东投票前实际上是上涨的。**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500: 一个追踪美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）确实触及了 680.8，现在是 678。所以对于标普来说，今天不算糟糕。SoFi 上涨了 2%，AMD 上涨了 3%。然后 Robinhood 在这里上涨了 5.5%。我们看到 Palantir 下跌了约 1.5%。然后 Reddit 上涨了 0.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh the implied move is 7%. Uh now that implied move, I think was before the 5% move today, which is, you know, it's what makes earnings such a gamble sometimes because you just never know how it's going to play out. Nvidia kind of getting a dump right here into the close. Applovin has a 10% move. ARM 7%, Door Dash 8%, Snapchat 13%, ONQ 9.3, and then Figma uh as their second quarter as a public company. That is also a 13% move. Nvidia right there going down. Tesla actually up going into the shareholder vote tomorrow. S&P 500 did hit 680.8 right now. We're at 678. So, not a horrible day for the S&P. SoFi is up 2%. AMD is up 3%. And then Robin right here up 5 and a half% as we are getting into a pound right there down about 1.5. Then Reddit up 0.2.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为在我们进入这次财报季时，需要理解的另一件重要事情，并且要始终把它放在一个背景中来看，那就是 Robinhood 在 2023 年 12 月时股价是 7 美元。现在是 144 美元。它是整个标普 500 指数中表现最好的股票，因为他们在两个月前被纳入了标普 500 指数。所以，恭喜所有股东，他们也进入了标普 500。所以，看，如果股价真的下跌 10%，那么它就不是上涨 230%，而是上涨 225% 或 220%。到了这个地步，这些数字就变得有点像是“好吧，它显然涨了很多”。对于像我们很多人这样持有大量头寸的投资组合来说，这确实会造成实质性的影响，但这并非我们不能心存感激的事情。所以我只想看到公司继续执行。只要他们执行得好，我认为长期股东就会得到回报。如果你在赌财报，你只需要记住，我们有很多公司公布了非常好的数据，但很多利好已经被市场消化了，这意味着财报结果在股价表现方面不一定会如你所愿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the other important thing to understand uh as we get into this earnings um and just always to put some context into it, Robin Hood was $7 back in December of 2023. It is now 144. It is the best performing stock in the entire S&P 500 because they got in to the S&P 500 two months ago. So, uh congratulations to all shareholders on them getting into the S&P 500 as well. So, look, if the stock does take a dip and it goes down 10%, instead of being up 230%, it's up 225% or 220%. Like it's it's at at this point the numbers become kind of just like okay it's up a lot obviously and it's going to hurt materially portfolios that are have big positions to it like a lot of us do but it's not something we can't be grateful for. So I just want to see the company execute. As long as they execute I think long-term shareholders will be rewarded. If you are speculating on earnings you just got to remember we've had a lot of companies give really good numbers but a lot of it was priced in and that means the the earnings don't necessarily turn out the way you want in terms of stock price action.</p>
</details>

>> 公司的长期愿景是我们三个人都关注的焦点。除非他们公布负数，否则这将有助于公司的长期愿景，看到更多的用户更频繁地交易，增加他们在 Robinhood 上的总钱包份额。从我最近看到的一切来看，比如 Vlad Tenev 与特斯拉社区和 Open Door 社区的互动，他们只是在激励和希望更多的人来到这个平台。老实说，我认为这正在奏效。所以我认为第三季度会很好。我认为第四季度，除了可能出现的交易量不足之外，我实际上认为 Robinhood 在第四季度的市场份额增长也会非常可观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the the long-term vision of the company is what I think all three of us are focused on. And unless they show negative numbers, it's going to help out the long-term vision of this company, seeing more members that are transacting more often, that are increasing their total share of wallet on Robin Hood. And from everything I'm seeing lately, like with Vlad Tennv's interaction with the Tesla community and the Open Door community, they only are incentivizing and wanting people more to come onto that platform. And I honestly think it's working. So I I think Q3 is going to be good. I think Q4, aside from the lack of trading volume that might end up showing up, I actually think Robin Hood will see an outsized amount of market share growth in Q4 as well.</p>
</details>

>> 但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we'll see.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这是他们最后一个比较容易的比较基数了。第四季度会更难。嗯，我认为他们会没事的，但之后会更具挑战性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this this is the last pretty easy comp that they have. Q4 will be harder. Um I think they'll be fine, but uh it does get more challenging beyond this.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便问一下，Emit，你的名单上有 Chime 吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you have Chime on that list by the way, Emit?</p>
</details>

</details>

>> 好的。Chime Financial。哇，财报前上涨了 7%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Chime Financial. This is Wow, it's up 7% going into the print.</p>
</details>

>> 我们拭目以待。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We'll see.</p>
</details>

>> 曾几何时，你可以在 17 美元以下买到这家公司的股票。嗯，实际上几乎是 16 美元以下。它跌得太快了。所以，我们拭目以待。这是他们有史以来的第二次季度报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> One day you could buy this company under $17. Uh well, actually almost under 16 bucks. It drops so fast. So, we'll see. This is their second ever quarterly report.</p>
</details>

### 新产品线：增长的关键驱动力

>> 是的。我认为在财报发布之际，另一件重要的事情是这些新产品的发展轨迹。正如 Roy 和 Tanner 所说，预测市场是一件大事。我想每个人都开始意识到，预测市场已经成为任何大型事件文化的一部分，无论是纽约市长选举还是体育赛事。所以，作为一个有朝一日可以成长为十亿美元业务的产品，我认为管理层谈论它会非常重要。信用卡现在大概有 45 万用户。我想候补名单上有超过 300 万人。所以整个银行业生态系统很重要。我们九月份刚刚举办了 Hood 峰会。我们很多人在那里见到了你们。Cortex AI、Robinhood Social。我的意思是，他们有很多不同的垂直领域，我认为他们已经为 2026 年准备好了。所以，我也很好奇他们会如何谈论他们最新产品的增长，期货、指数期权，以及他们今年推出的所有不同产品，我认为超过 15 种。然后，这些将如何影响 2026 年的情况，无论市场是像超级碗一样火爆，还是平淡，甚至熊市。他们如何为公司未来的发展定位？我认为这是很多人会关心的。另外，他们将在湾区进行现场直播。他们今天早上宣布了，将在大通中心举行。我不会去。我不在加州。我们都不在，但他们仍然会有一个现场财报电话会议，所以看他们做 NBA 新闻发布会式的财报会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I think uh the other thing that's important going into earnings is um the trajectory of these new products. So, as Roy and Tanner were talking about, prediction markets is a big deal. I think everyone is starting to realize that prediction markets are part of the culture of just any big event, whether it's the New York mayor election or uh sports events. So that as a as a product that can grow into a billion dollar business one day. I think that's going to be really important for management to talk about. Credit card now is like 450,000 people. Uh I think over three million people on the wait list. So the whole banking ecosystem that's important. We just had hood summit in September. All of us got to meet a bunch of you guys there. Uh Cortex AI, Robin Hood social. I mean there's a lot of different verticals I think they have ready to tap into for 2026. So, I would also be curious to see how they talk about the growth that of their latest products, futures, index options, all the different things they ship this year, which I think is well over 15 different products. And then how that bleeds into what's going to happen in 26 regardless of if it's a Super Bowl market or if it's, you know, casual or even if it's a bare market. How do they position the company going forward in the future? And I think that's what a lot of people will care about. Also, uh it's going to be live in the Bay Area. They're doing it at the Chase Stadium. They announced it this morning. I will not be there. I'm not in uh California. None of us are, but we uh they are still going to have a live earnings call and so it'll be fun to kind of see them do the NBA press conference type of earnings.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态：Nvidia 与谷歌的重磅消息

不确定为什么 Nvidia 会下跌。在我们即将结束今天交易的时候，它正受到冲击。哇，Nvidia 下跌了 12%。我没有看到任何头条新闻。Tanner，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not sure why Nvidia is going down. It is getting hit right here as we get into the end of the day. Wow. One 2% down on Nvidia. I don't see any headline. Tanner, do you know?</p>
</details>

>> 呃，不。不，我没有关注。我还是喜欢……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh no. No, I have not been following. I I still like</p>
</details>

>> 在崩盘发生时，我心想“哦不，195了”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> while the crash is happening I'm like oh no 195.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，就是这样，对吧？这东西在过去三周一直卡在 170，现在我们生气它从 200 跌到 195。就好像到了年底的那个阶段，我们想在最后两个月里拿到最终的数字，但如果这些股票没有以历史新高收盘也没关系。这不是什么坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, this is the thing, right? It's like this thing was stuck at 170 for the past three weeks and now we're mad it's from 200 to 195. It's just like it's that part of the end of the year where we're trying to get those final numbers in the last two months, but it's okay if these names don't end at alltime highs. It's not a horrible thing.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我不太清楚为什么 Nvidia 今天会下跌，但我知道在 Palantir 之后，有很多头条新闻说 AI 可能被过度炒作了，结果 Palantir 股价下跌了等等，因为他们有一个惊人的季度。我看到这影响到了其他几家 AI 公司，包括 Nvidia，我的意思是，这就像是回到了大约一周前的水平。所以，哦不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I I don't know exactly why Nvidia is falling today, but I I know with Palunteer uh afterwards there was a lot of headlines like that maybe AI is overhyped and Palanteer is falling as a result and everything because they had an amazing quarter and and I've seen that translate to several other A&Ms including uh Nvidia which I mean it's like levels not seen since like a week ago. So Oh no.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。当一只股票上涨时，情况就是这样，好吧，当它下跌时，即使它上涨可能是出于某种原因，它下跌也可能是出于某种原因。最终，我们必须消化这一点。这里有一条关于谷歌的头条新闻，非常重要。这是来自彭博社的。苹果正在敲定一项协议，每年向谷歌支付约 10 亿美元，将其 1.2 万亿参数的 Gemini AI 模型整合到 Siri 中。这将是一件大事。我们听到了很多关于苹果和谷歌合作的传闻。看起来苹果可能会选择 Gemini 而不是 ChatGPT，来为 Siri 的扩展建立一个有意义的框架，这就是为什么谷歌股价上涨了一点。但这进一步表明，这只在今年大部分时间里都停留在 150 美元的股票，最终还是表现出色。谷歌股价现在是 28 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. It's the thing about when a stock goes up, it's like, well, when it goes down, even if it was probably going up for whatever reason, it will go down for whatever reason. And ultimately, we have to digest that. There was a headline with Google right here that was really important. Uh, this is from Bloomberg. Apple is finalizing a deal to pay Google about 1 billion a year to integrate its 1.2 trillion parameter Gemin Gemini AI model into Siri. That would be a pretty big deal. We've heard a lot of rumors about Apple and Google working together. It looks like Apple's potentially going with Gemini over Chat GBT to really establish a meaningful framework for Siri to expand and uh that's why Google stocks up a little bit. But it just further goes to show that this stock that was stuck at 150 for the majority of the year really ended up working out. Google right there 28.</p>
</details>

>> 我在这里看到一条推文。Nvidia 在有报道称主要云服务提供商正在缩减 2025 年的 GPU 订单后暴跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm seeing a tweet here. Nvidia tumbles after reports suggest major cloud providers are scaling back GPU orders for 2025.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. That that that exact thing.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。那是彭博社的报道。那确实会造成影响。我的意思是，那样的头条新闻足够了。等等。那……

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Okay. That's the Bloomberg. That That would do it. I mean, that would be enough of a headline. Well, hold on. What about I</p>

You know, if Jensen sees a pathway and by the way scaling back in 2020 or for GPU purchases in 2025, it's freaking November. What are we talking about?

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Okay.</p>

>> 好的。让我来读一下这个。我们开始。营收同比增长 100%。12.7 亿美元。净存款创纪录，达到 200 亿美元。兄弟……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. Let me read through this. Here we go. Revenue up 100% year-over-year. 1.27 billion. Net deposits were record 20 billion. Dude,</p>
</details>

>> 我想他们最多也就做过 130 亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the most they've ever done is 13 billion.</p>
</details>

>> 我的天哪。净存款增加了 70 亿。Robinhood Gold 订阅用户创纪录，达到 390 万。每股收益 61 美分。Robinhood 现在有 11 个业务线，年化收入达到或超过 1 亿美元。我们开始。我们团队不懈的产品迭代速度在第三季度推动了创纪录的业务成果，而且我们没有放慢脚步。预测市场增长迅速。Robinhood 银行业务开始推出，Robinhood Ventures 即将到来，Vlad 说。第三季度是又一个强劲的盈利增长季度，我们继续多元化我们的业务，增加了两个或更多的业务线，预测市场和 Bitstamp，它们的年化收入约为 1 亿美元或更多。第四季度开局强劲，10 月份在股票、期权、预测市场和期货方面的月度交易量创下纪录，保证金余额也创下新高。呃，净营收再次达到 12.7 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my god. 7 billion increase on net deposits. Robin Hood Gold subscribers record 3.9 million. EPS 61 cents. Robin and now to 11 business lines generating 100 more million or more in annualized revenues. Here we go. Our team's relentless product velocity drove record business results in Q3 and we're not slowing down. Prediction markets growing rapidly. Robin Banking is starting to roll out and Robin Adventures is coming, said Vlad. Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth and we continue to diversify our business adding two or more business lines, prediction markets in Bitstamp that are generating approximately 100 million or more in annualized revenues. And Q4 is off to a strong start in October with record monthly trading volumes across equities, options, prediction markets, and futures and new highs for margin balances. Uh net revenues again 1.27 billion.</p>
</details>

>> 交易收入 7.3 亿。净利息收入 4.56 亿。我想这是他们有史以来最高的，或者接近最高。其他收入 8800 万。呃，净利润 5.56 亿。所以 12.7 亿中，有 5.56 亿是纯利润。嗯，调整后 eBay 177%，有资金的客户 2680 万。资产 3330 亿。这相当可观。净存款 204 亿。再次，这简直令人难以置信。**ARPU**（Average Revenue Per User: 每用户平均收入，指公司从每个活跃用户那里获得的平均收入）为 191 美元。黄金订阅用户增加了近 200 万，总数达到 390 万。他们有 43 亿现金。他们以 104 美元的价格回购了 100 万股自己的股票。所以，他们花了 1.07 亿回购股票。嗯，所以通过股票回购，你减少了大约 100 万股。10 月份净存款为 55 亿美元，保证金增长 150% 至 160 亿美元，这与我们从 FINRA 听到的类似，那里的保证金贷款处于历史最高水平，遍及所有券商。股票交易量 3200 亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Transaction 730. Net interest 456. I think that's their highest ever or close to their highest. Other revenues 88 million. Uh net income 556 million. So 556 out of the 1.27 billion was pure profit. Um adjusted eBay 177% funded customers 26.8 million. Assets 333 billion. It's pretty big. Net deposits 20.4. Again, that is just incredible. Arpoo is at 191 a user. Gold subscribers up by almost 2 million, 3.9 million total. They have 4.3 billion in cash. They bought a million shares of their stock at a 104. So, they spent 107 million buying their stock. Um, and so you had about a million shares with the share buybacks. October net deposits were 5 a.5 billion margin up 150% to 16 billion which is similar to what we've heard from uh FINRA right that that and margin loans are at their highest levels ever across every brokerage equity volumes 320 billion</p>

</details>

>> 好的，这就是你得到的消息。首席财务官 Jason Warick 宣布打算明年退休。Jason 将在第一季度从首席财务官的职位上过渡，并担任战略顾问。这可能是股价下跌的原因，仅仅因为首席财务官要退休了。但这就是你得到的消息。呃，Roy，你对这些数字的初步看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, that's what you got. A CFO Jason Warick announces intention to retire next year. Jason will transition from his role as CFO in Q1 and be a strategic adviser.

</details>

>> 我的意思是，是的，太荒谬了。分析师和我们自己的期望都很高，但他们还是超出了预期。这是一家在基本面上执行力极强的公司，火力全开。未来也有很多增长杠杆，我同意你的看法，可能很多利好已经被市场消化了，你可能被定价到完美，也许情况就是这样。但当一家公司的首席财务官离职时，股价出现下跌并不罕见。我实际上见过这种情况比首席执行官离职时更频繁，因为首席财务官是一个关键角色，有时，虽然 Robinhood 不会是这种情况，但人们会想，“哦，他们要走了，所以肯定有什么非常糟糕的事情要发生了。”嗯，我不认为情况是这样。我认为这一直是计划的一部分。Jason 很棒。我祝愿他未来一切顺利。但是，是的，这是一个非常有才华的团队，所以不用担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, yeah, ridiculous. Uh we expectations were high from analysts and also from us and they they still beat it. Uh this is a company that executes fundamentally their fire on all cylinders. Um a lot of future growth levers too and I agree with you like that probably you know maybe it's some of it a lot of it was priced in u you could be priced to perfection and maybe that's the case but it's not uncommon when the CFO of a company leaves that there is a dip afterwards. I I've actually seen that more often than when the CEO leaves just because CFO is a critical role and sometimes which will not be the case for Robin Hood. There's people like, "Oh, they're leaving so it must be something that's really bad that's out there." Well, I don't think that's the case. I think this has always been the plan. Jason's amazing. Um, and I wish him well in whatever he has in the future. But, uh, yeah, it's a very talented group, so no concerns there.</p>

### 财报电话会：管理层解读与未来展望

>> 嘿，大家好，我正在我们的办公室，准备参加我们的 2025 年第三季度财报电话会议，会议将在旧金山的大通中心进行直播。这里有一个快速摘要。第三季度是又一个创纪录的季度，这得益于我们持续不懈的产品迭代速度。营收比去年翻了一番，创下历史新高。每股收益也同时增长了三倍多。我们在三个战略支柱上都取得了巨大进展。首先，对于活跃交易者，我们在第三季度创下了股票和期权交易量的纪录。保证金账户余额在过去 18 个月里增长了三倍，创下历史新高。我们的预测市场正在蓬勃发展，仅在第三季度就交易了超过 20 亿份事件合约。不仅如此，10 月份的规模更大，超过了整个第三季度的总和。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everyone, I'm here in our offices getting ready for our Q3 2025 earnings call streaming live from the Chase Center in San Francisco. Here's a quick rundown. Q3 was another record quarter driven by our continued relentless product velocity. Revenues doubled from last year to a record high. EPS also more than tripled at the same time. And we made great progress across our three strategic pillars. First, for active traders, we set records for equity and options trading volumes in Q3. Margin account balances tripled over the past 18 months to a record high. And our prediction markets are ripping with over two billion event contracts traded in Q3 alone. Not only that, October was even bigger, bigger than all of Q3 combined.</p>
</details>

>> 我们增加了职业和大学橄榄球、娱乐、政治、经济、科技等领域的合约，还有更多。这真的正在成为一个全面的产品，不仅对交易者而言，也是一个全新的信息来源。我们在这里没有放慢脚步。在 HoodSummit 上，我们推出了强大的新工具，如 Robinhood Social。还有由 Robinhood Cortex 驱动的 AI 驱动的自定义指标和扫描器。非常令人兴奋。以及做空和多个个人经纪账户。Robinhood Legend 也在持续增长。我们非常喜欢我们所看到的情况。记住，我们基本上是从零开始为网页端的活跃交易者服务的，我们认为这里还有大量的市场份额可以争取。这都是我们对待活跃交易方式的一部分。我们想让使用 Robinhood 成为一个无需思考的选择。我们越来越认为，使用任何其他平台都会让你处于劣势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we've added contracts for pro and college football, entertainment, politics, economics, technology, and so much more. This is really becoming a comprehensive offering, not just for traders, but also brand new source of information. We're not slowing down here. At HoodSummit, we unveiled powerful new tools like Robin Hood social. Also AIdriven custom indicators and scanners powered by Robin Hood Cortex. Very exciting. as well as shorting and multiple individual brokerage accounts. Robin Legend also continuing to grow. We really like what we're seeing there. Remember, we started basically from zero on active traders for web and we think there's a ton more market share to be gained here. And this is all part and parcel of our approach to active trading. We want to make it a no-brainer to use Robin Hood. And increasingly so, we think you'll be at a disadvantage using any other platform.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。第二，在钱包份额方面，我们希望成为你的主要和次要金融账户，我们正在取得很大进展。我们看到平台总资产势头强劲，现在有三分之一万亿美元的资产存放在 Robinhood。客户们非常喜欢我们的长期投资产品，Robinhood Retirement 和 Robinhood Strategies 的增长都非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Second, on the wallet share front, we want to be your primary and secondary financial account, and we're making a lot of progress. We're seeing strong momentum in total platform assets with a third of a trillion dollars now held at Robin Hood. Customers are loving our long-term investing products, both Robin Hood Retirement and Robin Hood Strategies ramping up super nicely.</p>
</details>

>> 此外，我们正在迅速向更多客户发放金卡，并且我们也已经开始推出 Robinhood 银行业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Plus, we're rapidly shipping gold cards to more customers, and we've begun the roll out for Robin Hood banking as well.</p>
</details>

>> 第三，最后但同样重要的是，我们正在全球扩张，因为我们正在构建全球第一的金融生态系统。代币化是我们全球扩张的一个重要加速器。你可能会在这个黑板上看到我们欧洲活动的照片。在欧洲，我们正在继续执行我们的路线图，我们将向客户提供的股票代币数量增加了一倍多。我们还推出了永续期货，在美国，我们很高兴能通过 Robinhood Ventures 让散户股东接触到私营公司。未来还有更多。还有很多要分享的。所以请在 investors.robinhood.com 查看我们的完整业绩。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, last but not least, we're expanding globally as we build the number one global financial ecosystem. Tokenization has been a big accelerant to our global expansion. And you might see in this chalkboard here from our European event in Europe. We're continuing to execute on our roadmap and we more than doubled the number of stock tokens available to our customers. We also rolled out perpetual futures and in the US we're excited to bring access to private companies to retail shareholders through Robin Hood Ventures. Plenty more to come there. There's a lot more to share. So check out our full results at investors.roinhood.com</p>

>> Robinhood 现在是 140 美元。我知道股价现在是平的，但我的天哪，那太不可思议了。第三季度月活跃用户 1380 万，而之前是 1331 万。所以月活跃用户有所增加，这很重要。Julian，谢谢你的超级留言，伙计。非常感谢。恭喜所有 Hood 的持有者。未来几年我们会走得更高。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Robin right there. 140. I know the stock is flat right here, but my goodness, that was incredible. 3Q monthly active users, 13.8 million versus 13.31. So, you have an increase on the MAUs, which is important. Julian, thank you for the super chat, man. Really appreciate it. Congrats to all Hood holders. We're going higher in the years to come.</p>
</details>

>> Julian，自从 Hood 股价在 10、15 美元的时候，他就一直在关注我们三个人。在过去几年里，他一直在加仓。你知道，真的，任何一个敢于尝试的人，无论是在 10、20、30、40、50、60 还是 70 美元，如果你在 90 天前 Robinhood 回购时以 104 美元买入，你知道，它的表现都非常出色。但是这个季度，Hood 的这个季度真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Julian, he's been uh watching all three of us since Hood was like 10, 15 bucks. And he's been loading up over the past couple years. And you know, really anyone who's just taking a shot, whether it was 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, if you bought at 104 when Robin Hood bought 30 days ago, 90 days ago, you know, it has done incredibly well. But the quarter, that was a hell of a quarter by Hood.</p>

#### CEO Vlad Tenev 开场陈词

很高兴见到大家。很高兴能和大家在这里相聚。今天我们再次迎来了现场观众，这次是在旧金山市中心，同时也很高兴，我想这是我们财报电话会议的第一次，有机构和散户股东并肩加入我们，所以欢迎大家，也谢谢你们。我们还有机构分析师，很高兴在这里看到很多熟悉的面孔。

Today we have a live audience again this time from downtown San Francisco and also great to I think for the first time in our earnings call have uh institutional and retail shareholders so by side joining us so welcome and thank you also we have our institutional analysts so uh good to see a lot of familiar faces here.</p>
</details>

>> 第三季度是又一个产品迭代速度惊人的季度。所以我们很高兴看到，这确实贯穿了我们的三个重点领域，提醒一下，这三个领域分别是：第一，在活跃交易者中排名第一；第二，在下一代用户的钱包份额中排名第一；第三，成为全球第一的金融生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Q3 uh was another quarter of relentless product velocity. So we we were excited to see that uh it was really across our three focus areas which as a reminder number one in active traders number one in wallet share for the next generation number one global financial ecosystem.</p>
</details>

>> 所以，我将简要介绍一下每一个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'll briefly go through each of these.</p>
</details>

>> 对于活跃交易者，我们希望活跃交易者觉得如果他们在 Robinhood 以外的任何地方交易，他们就处于劣势。我们为活跃交易者推出了大量出色的新产品。你们可能已经看到了几周前在拉斯维加斯举行的第二届年度 Hood 峰会。我们宣布了一系列经纪业务更新、做空、多个经纪账户、由 Robinhood Cortex 驱动的 AI 驱动的自定义指标、一个全新的社交平台 Robinhood Social，而且我们还有更多。我们还有更多要带给你们。我们迫不及待地想在下个月我们首次举办的 AI 活动上分享更多，活动时间是 12 月 16 日。这样的创新确实让活跃交易者引擎高速运转。在第三季度，我们的股票和期权交易量创下纪录。而 10 月份对于股票和期权来说看起来更好。在 10 月份，我们创下了新的单日历史新高和新的月度纪录。所以，这两项业务都继续表现强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Active traders, we want active traders to feel like they are at a disadvantage if they trade anywhere other than Robin Hood. And we've rolled out a ton of great new products for active traders. You guys might have seen second annual Hood Summit in Vegas just a couple weeks ago. We announced a bunch of brokerage updates, shorting, multiple brokerage accounts, AIdriven custom indicators powered by Robin Hood Cortex, a whole new social platform, Robin Hood social, and we've got more. We've got more for you guys. We can't wait to share more next month at our first ever AI event on December 16th. Innovation like this really has the active trader engine humming. In Q3, we had record equity and option trading volumes. And October looks even better for both equities and options. In the month of October, we had new single day alltime and new monthly records. So, both of those businesses just continuing to perform strongly.</p>
</details>

>> 预测市场真的火了。很难相信我们大约一年前才推出这个，当时是总统选举市场。从那时起，我们每个季度的交易量都翻了一番，到第三季度达到了 23 亿份合约。仅 10 月份一个月就达到了 25 亿份合约。所以 10 月份本身就比整个第三季度还要大。客户们真的很喜欢这个产品，我们也在为他们带来更多。我们现在有超过一千个实时合约，并且我们扩大了类别。所以，不仅是体育，还有经济、政治、文化。我们正在让用户界面更简洁，体验更好。我认为看到这个能发展到什么程度真的很令人兴奋。我的意思是，我们喜欢成为这个新资产类别的早期参与者。有些人说这可能是最大的资产类别之一。你几乎可以在任何事情上定价风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Prediction markets are really on fire. It's hard to believe that we launched this just about a year ago with the presidential election markets. We've doubled volume every quarter since then to 2.3 billion contracts in Q3. And the month of October alone was up to two and a half billion contracts. So October by itself was bigger than all of Q3 combined. Customers really love the product and we're bringing them even more. We're now at over a thousand live contracts and we've expanded categories. So, it's not just sports, but also economics, politics, culture. We're making the UI much cleaner, the experience even better. And I think it's really exciting to see where this can go. I mean, we we love being early to this new asset class. And some people are saying this could be one of the largest asset classes. You can price risk in pretty much anything.</p>

#### CFO Jason Warick 财务回顾

>> 听起来不错。谢谢 Vlad。在第三季度，我们又实现了一个强劲盈利增长的季度。营收翻了一番，同时利润率扩大，每股收益比去年增长了三倍多。年初至今到第三季度，营收增长了 65%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sounds good. Uh thanks Vlad. In Q3 we delivered another quarter of strong profitable growth. Revenue doubled while margins expanded and earnings per share more than tripled from last year. Uh year-to- date through Q3, revenues are up 65%.</p>
</details>

>> 每股收益增长了 150%，我们继续在开支上保持纪律，实现了 75% 的增量调整后 EBID 利润率。令人兴奋的是，随着我们业务的增长，我们正在持续多元化。在第三季度，又有两个业务，预测市场和 Bitstamp，各自的年化收入都超过了 1 亿美元，使我们的总数达到了 11 个，这突显了我们业务日益增长的多元化和实力。预测市场在不到一年的时间里就达到了这个里程碑。这是我们历史上最快的，而且根据 10 月份的交易量，它已经朝着 3 亿美元的年化运行率迈进。所以，真的真的发展得很快。现在，让我们更仔细地看看我们第三季度的业绩与一年前的比较。营收翻了一番，达到了近 13 亿美元的历史新高，因为我们的客户保持了参与度，并继续将更多的资产带到这个平台。交易量在股票、期权和加密货币方面都实现了两位数到三位数的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earnings per share is up 150% and we continue to stay disciplined on expenses to deliver 75% incremental adjusted EBID margins. And it's exciting that as our business grows, we're continuing to diversify. In Q3, two more businesses, Prediction Markets and Bitstamp, each surpassed a h 100red million in annualized revenue, bringing us to 11 in total and underscoring the growing diversification and strength of our business. Prediction Markets reached that milestone in less than a year. It's our fastest in history, and it's already tracking towards a $300 million run rate based on on October volumes. So, just really really going uh going fast. Now, let's take a closer look at our Q3 results compared to a year ago. Revenues doubled to an all-time high nearly 1.3 billion as our customers remained engaged and continued to bring more of their assets to the platform. Trading volumes were up double to triple digits across equities, options, and crypto.</p>
</details>

>> 我们在各个产品类别中的市场份额持续增长。我们也看到了像预测市场、指数期权和期货等新产品的强劲贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we continue to grow market share across product categories. We're also seeing strong contributions from newer products like prediction markets, index options, and futures.</p>
</details>

>> 生息资产增长超过 50%，这得益于强劲的保证金和现金余额增长。看到保证金业务随着我们赢得更大的客户和获得市场份额而持续创下新高，这非常棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interest earning assets were up over 50% driven by strong margin and cash sweep growth. It's great to see margin continuing to hit new highs as we win larger customers and gain market share.</p>
</details>

>> 证券借贷业务也创下历史新高，市场背景强劲，因为 IPO 活动持续回暖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And securities lending also hit an all-time high with a strong market backdrop as IPO activity continued to pick up.</p>
</details>

>> Robinhood Gold 订阅用户增长到 390 万。同比增长超过 75%，因为我们继续扩大价值主张，包括刚刚开始推出的 Robinhood 银行业务。呃，转向开支，第三季度调整后的运营支出和股权激励为 6.13 亿美元。比我们之前展望范围的中点高出约 4000 万美元。呃，这是由两个都与我们强劲表现相关的项目驱动的。首先，年初至今更强的业绩导致第三季度员工奖金应计额更高。呃，这对第三季度来说更高，但也包括了今年上半年的补计。呃，其次，嗯，我们今年股价的大幅上涨触发了 2019 年 CEO 市场化奖励剩余部分的兑现。呃，这导致了 GNA 中未计划的工资税支出。我们现在已经处理完了那个奖励。所以很高兴你又能回到每年 4 万美元的薪水了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Robin Hood Gold grew to 3.9 million subscribers. That's over 75% year-over-year growth as we continue to broaden the value proposition, including Robin Hood Banking, which is just uh beginning to roll out. Uh turning to expenses, Q3 adjusted OPEX and sharebased compensation came in at 613 million. It's about 40 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook range. Uh this was driven by two items that are both related to our strong performance. first stronger year-to- date results led to higher Q3 employee bonus acral. Uh that is higher for Q3 but also includes a catch up for the first half of the year. Uh and second um the significant increase in our stock price this year triggered vesting on the remaining trunch of the 2019 CEO market-based award. Uh this resulted in unplanned payroll tax expense in GNA. We are through that award now. So glad you get to go back to your 40,000 a year.</p>

#### 管理层问答环节精选

>> 好的。呃，谢谢你，Jason。呃，在问答环节，我们将首先回答来自 Say Technologies 的股东问题，这些股东是通过视频加入我们的。在 Say 的问题之后，我们将转向现场观众的提问，然后再转到电话接入的参与者。所以我将从 Say 的第一个问题开始，这个问题来自 Preston。

<p class="english-text">>> Hello. Yeah, he's</p>
</details>

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Look at that. He's got the Robin Hood logo. Did you draw that yourself?</p>
</details>

>> 我几天前在课上画的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I painted that in class a couple days ago.</p>
</details>

>> 哇。太棒了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Wow. Awesome.</p>
</details>

>> 但我想知道你们预计以多快的速度向用户推出 Robinhood 银行业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But I was wondering how quickly do you expect to roll out Robin Hood banking to users?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，很好的问题。这将是一个相对较快的推出。当你将银行业务与信用卡相比时，没有同样的考虑，即需要确保借贷和支出之间的经济效益得到完美校准。我认为银行业务在这方面是一个更简单的产品。因此，推出将仅受客户反馈的支配。我们喜欢我们迄今为止看到的情况，因此我们将继续推出，我们预计如果没有意外，应该会很快。我们已经有客户在试用它，包括在一些市场提供现金交付，早期结果非常好。所以如果你在纽约州并且可以使用银行业务，你现在就可以试试。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, great question. Uh, this will be a relatively fast roll out. When you compare banking to the credit card, there's not the same considerations around making sure the economics between the borrowing and the spending are uh perfectly calibrated. I think banking is a simpler product in that way. And so the roll out will just be governed by customer feedback. Uh we like what we see thus far and so we're going to continue to to roll out and we expect that if there's no surprises it should be it should be pretty quick. We've already got customers trying it including cash delivery available in some markets and early results are really good. So if you're in the state of New York and have access to banking you can try it right now.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Okay, thank you, Vlad. Uh, the next question is from Roy from Crossroads.</p>
</details>

>> 谢谢你接受我的提问，并向 Jason 和 Shiv 表示热烈祝贺，也祝贺大家取得了如此出色的季度业绩，非常令人印象深刻。预测市场活动出现了巨大的增长，我很好奇平台上显示的交易量是 Ky 和 Robinhood 的混合体，还是纯粹的 Robinhood？另外，Robinhood 是否考虑将这项业务扩展到国际市场，甚至与或领先于其当前的交易扩张计划？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Thanks for taking my question and huge congratulations to Jason and also Shiv and congrats to everybody on a great quarter two and uh very impressive there's been a huge increase in predictions market activity and I'm curious if the volume shown in the platform is a mix of Ky and Robin Hood uh or is it just pure Robin Hood and also is Robin Hood considering expanding this internationally even alongside or even ahead of its current uh trading expansion plans?</p>
</details>

>> 好问题。你想回答吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good question. You want to field it?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，当然。我们展示的交易量是 Robinhood 上的交易量。我相信 Khi 正在统计我们发送给他们的活动，这是相当可观的，对于我们提供的合约，我认为 Koshi 的很大一部分交易量实际上来自 Robinhood。关于国际化，Vlad，我让你来回答这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, sure. The uh the volumes that we're showing are the volumes that are on um on Robin Hood. Uh I'm sure Khi uh is counting the activity that we send to them, which is quite substantial and and for contracts that we offer, I think a very large chunk of Koshi's volume is actually uh coming from Robin Hood. In terms of international, Vlad, I'll let you uh cover that one.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我们确实在密切关注。而且，你知道，你谈到代币化，就像之前的一些提问者提到的那样，预测市场是另一个资产类别，它实际上有很强的加密货币成分，尤其是在美国以外。所以我们肯定在研究什么是将它带给我们客户的最有效方式。我认为这将是具体情况具体分析，在每个司法管辖区可能略有不同，但我们有一些选择。你知道，作为一个规模化的传统参与者，同时在加密货币方面也有所建树，我想我们可以在每个司法管辖区选择最好的方式，这是我们肯定在密切关注的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, we're we're definitely looking into it closely. Um and you know you talk about tokenization uh as as some of the previous callers have have brought up prediction markets is another uh another asset class that actually has a strong crypto component particularly outside the US. So, we're definitely taking a look at what's the most effective way to get that to our customers. And I think it's going to be on a case-byase basis, maybe slightly different in uh each jurisdiction, but we have some options. You know, as a scaled traditional player, but also on the on the crypto side, uh I think we we'll have our our pick of what's best in each jurisdiction, and that's something we're we're definitely closely looking at.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Okay, thank you. Uh, the next question is from Tanner uh, with Future Investing.</p>
</details>

>> 嘿，伙计们。呃，首先，我想先问一个……你们能听到我吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey guys. Uh first off, I just wanted to start off with a uh Can you guys hear me?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我们能听到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes, we can hear you.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。抱歉。关于 Robinhood 平台上的加密货币质押，到目前为止，如果有什么见解的话。然后还有一个小小的请求，如果你们愿意在未来的月度指标更新中公布事件合约的交易量。就这样。关于质押的数量，我想我们在季度末大约是 10 亿美元。你知道，过去几天市场波动很大，所以我想它有所下降，但是，你知道，客户对质押能力的反应非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Sorry. Uh with a crypto question around crypto staking on the uh Robin Hood platform so far, if there's any insights there and then also just maybe a small request if you guys are open to publishing event contracts volume on their monthly metrics updates going forward. That's it. on the amount staked. I think it's we exited the quarter at about a billion. Um, you know, the market's been pretty volatile over the last few days, so I think it's come down a little bit, but uh but you know, customers are responding very well to to the ability to stake.</p>
</details>

>> 那关于在月度指标中公布事件合约交易量呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What about what about the event contract volume published in monthly metrics?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，是的，我会把这个留给 Shiv 考虑。我不想为他承诺，但是，我们确实，说真的，我们喜欢对投资者尽可能透明，我们一直在寻找方法来提供增量披露，以帮助你们理解业务。所以这是我们会考虑的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh, yeah, I'll I'll uh I'll leave that with Shiv as something to consider. I don't want to promise that for him, but uh we we do we do like in all seriousness uh being as transparent as possible for investors and and we're always looking at ways to to provide incremental uh disclosure to to help uh you understand the business. So that's something we'll look at.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，谢谢你的建议。

<details>
