### 人类文明的门槛与精神智慧的召唤

地球在发出一种声音，一种当物种需要“成长”时所发出的声音。你是否能感知到这声音在你内心深处的回响？许多信仰传统都教导我们，在人生的门槛面前，会显现出两条道路：一条是收缩（contraction），另一条是进化（evolution）。今天，我们八十亿人口正站在人类历史上最具决定性意义的门槛之上。这些时刻以各种形式降临：有被迫因海平面上升而放弃沿海家园的家庭；有眼睁睁看着数十年记忆化为灰烬的社区；有因账单上涨而不得不在取暖和食物之间抉择的老年夫妇。这些都是我在过去一年里亲眼目睹的真实经历。

当政治领导者们做出将数十亿生命任意视为可有可无的气候决策时，你或许也曾感到胸口一紧，不禁疑惑：“未来还会需要我吗？” 这就是门槛的感觉。一边是失落感的回响，另一边则是充满希望的可能性。这些气候门槛，恰恰映照着我们个人的经历：一次意料之外的诊断，一位挚爱的离去，一条突然关闭的道路。每一次，它们都在问我们：“当已知的一切都分崩离析时，我们将成为谁？” 这正是我今天想要与大家一同探索的。这不仅仅是环境挑战，更是一个邀请：当我们面临崩溃的诱惑，倾向于自我保护时，我们是否还能挺身而出，成为最好的自己？

多年来，我曾坚信气候紧急状态主要关乎技术和系统性的解决方案。然而，在那些遭受重创的社区里，我发现那些展现出最深层**韧性**（resilience: 指从逆境中恢复和适应的能力）的人们，他们汲取的源泉更为根本——那是跨越世代传承的**精神智慧**（spiritual wisdom: 指源自信仰、哲学或内在体验的深刻理解和指导）。在每一个灾难区域，我都发现了一种图表未能捕捉到的模式：那就是我们周围无处不在的**精神基础设施**（spiritual infrastructure: 指支撑社区精神和情感需求的社会结构和场所）——教堂的地下室、清真寺的庭院、锡克教寺庙里烹饪的数吨免费扁豆汤，它们在官方援助抵达前，维系着社区的凝聚力。

诚然，水泵至关重要，但必须有人坚信陌生人也配得上饮用这水。正如我逐渐学习和认识到的，**信仰**（faith）实际上关乎着**心灵的后勤**（logistics of the heart: 指处理情感、同情心和人际连接的实际运作）。这些传统并非陈迹，而是充满活力的韧性实验室。它们的仪式并非迷信，而是**社会电路**（social circuitry: 指在危机中连接和支持个体的情感和社交网络），在常规电路失效时，为人们提供信息路由。科学能提供数据，政策能制定法律。但我们深知，数字无法安慰风暴中惊恐的孩子，法律也无法替代我们在葬礼上低语的祈祷。

在过去的十年里，我有幸与全球性的信仰社群联盟合作，共同应对气候变化，并从陆地到海洋恢复生态系统。今天，我想分享一些我从这些传统中学到的、关于我们如何能“升华至最佳自我”的洞见。

There is a sound the planet makes
when it asks a species to grow up.
Can you hear it inside of you?
Many faith traditions teach
that at thresholds two paths appear,
one of contraction and one of evolution.
Today, eight billion of us
stand at humanity's
most consequential threshold yet.
And these moments arrive
in many different forms.
It's the families forced
to abandon coastal homes
because of sea level rise.
It's communities watching
decades of memories reduced to ash.
It's elderly couples
choosing between cooling or eating
because of rising bills.
These are real experiences
I've witnessed in the past year.
And as political leaders
make climate decisions
that arbitrarily mark
billions of lives as disposable,
perhaps you've also felt
that catch in your chest
when wondering:
Will the future still want me?
This is what thresholds can feel like.
Loss resonating on one side,
yet luminous possibility on the other.
And these climate thresholds
do mirror our personal ones.
It's the unexpected diagnosis.
It's the loss of a loved one.
It's the path that suddenly closes.
Each and every single time they ask us:
Who will we become
when everything we know unravels?
And this is what I want
to explore with you today.
Not just environmental challenge,
but an invitation.
Can we all still rise to our best selves,
even when collapse tempts us
towards self-preservation?
Now for years,
I believed the climate emergency
was primarily about technical
and systemic solutions.
But in devastated communities,
I found that those demonstrating
the deepest resilience
drew on something more fundamental.
It was spiritual wisdom
cultivated across generations.
In each disaster zone,
I found a pattern that charts had missed.
It was the spiritual
infrastructure all around us:
church basements, mosque courtyards,
Sikh gurdwaras cooking tons of free dal
that kept communities together
until formal aid arrived.
Yes, water pumps are vital,
but someone must believe
that strangers deserve that water.
Faith, as I've come to learn and realize,
is actually about
the logistics of the heart.
These traditions aren't relics,
but living laboratories of resilience.
Their rituals aren't superstition,
but social circuitry,
routing cards where normal circuits fail.
Science can give us the numbers.
Policy can give us the laws.
We know that the numbers don’t comfort
frightened children in a storm,
and laws aren't the prayers
that we speak at funerals.
For the past decade,
I've been very fortunate enough
to work with global coalitions
of faith communities,
confronting climate change and restoring
ecosystems from land to ocean.
And today, I'd like to share
just a few of these insights
that I learned from these traditions
about how we might rise
to our best selves.

### 危机导航：激进的诚实与系统性的神圣

我已分享了第一个洞见：信仰是一种**危机导航系统**（collapse navigation system: 指帮助个体或群体在灾难或剧变时期生存和适应的策略或智慧）。那些有时被视为古老落后的传统，实际上掌握着文明延续的关键。试想一下，这些传统历经了多次瘟疫、帝国更迭、无休止的战争，甚至小冰河时期，它们如同**文明黑匣子**（civilizational black boxes: 指在动荡时期保存和传递关键知识与价值观的系统），为这些不确定的时代保存了信息。

在当下，我们面临着对这一时刻意义以及它召唤我们成为谁的不同解读。而信仰传统能为我们提供穿越这种不确定性的指引。因此，我邀请你思考那些你所实践的、比市场和国家更古老的事务。那些早已刻入人类肌肉记忆的日常实践，远在边界和货币定义我们交换之前。这些传统不仅是遗迹，它们是你历经一次又一次危机考验过的导航技术。所以，问问自己：我身上承载着怎样的古老生存算法？因为我们现在所需的智慧，不仅在于新发明，更蕴藏在那些在人类最艰难的历程中，维系人类尊严的日常实践里。

然而，我们也深知，即使是最精密的导航技术，也需要关于我们真实立场的准确数据。这引出了我的下一个洞见：**激进的诚实**（radical honesty: 指深入、不回避地审视自身和系统的真实状态）。关于气候行动，一个总是令人惊讶的事实是，它始于一个悖论：我们必须向内审视，才能有效地向外行动。我非常欣赏苏菲派传统中哈兹拉特·伊纳提·汗（Hazrat Inayat Khan）的教诲，他认为我们真正的功课在于“调和不可调和之事”，而气候行动恰恰需要这种调和。

坦白说，我们都已成为识别外部障碍的专家：政治僵局、企业利益、殖民遗留……这些都真实存在。但信仰传统邀请我们审视一个更微妙的障碍：我们自身的矛盾。伪善（hypocrisy）不仅仅是罪过，它是一个GPS定位点，能指引我们走向更深层次的转变。伊斯兰教称之为**穆哈萨巴**（Muhasabah: 指自我反省或算账，在此语境下指审视自身行为与价值观的差距），印度教称之为**斯瓦迪亚亚**（Svadhyaya: 指自我学习或自我研究）。无论语言如何，这种实践始终如一：举起一面镜子，说出我们梦想的世界与我们行动所创造的世界之间的差距。

无论是气候活动家总是乘飞机参加峰会，还是某个会众宣扬“管理”理念，其基金会却资助化石燃料扩张。这些不一定是“取消资格”的理由，但它们是通往更深层真实性的门户。激进的诚实也应应用于持续审视我们所珍视的价值体系。我知道，那些曾孕育解放运动的信仰传统，也曾为殖民征服“神圣化”。同样，今天的气候行动主义，尽管充满道德清晰度，仍可能变得僵化、教条，并对其自身矛盾视而不见。因此，今晚让我们问自己：我们的行为在多大程度上投下了阴影，笼罩在我们最为珍视的价值之上？你能想到自己生活中的一个例子吗？

这个问题并非旨在让我们羞愧，而是为了解放我们。正是在我们站立于这些矛盾的敏感地带时，道德勇气才能涌现。当我们把同样的激进诚实应用于经济系统时，就迎来了下一个洞见：我称之为**系统性的神圣**（systemic sacred: 指将深层价值观与经济选择相结合的原则）。这是我们最深层的价值观与经济选择汇合之时。纵观历史，信仰与商业共同塑造了文明。当它们分道扬镳，文化可能撕裂；当它们和谐共鸣，文化便能绽放。

犹太教的**什米塔周期**（Shmita cycle: 犹太教的安息年，涉及土地休耕和债务豁免）将生态休养和债务豁免融入经济节奏与生活中。**佛教经济学**（Buddhist economics: 强调“适度”而非无尽增长的经济模式）强调“适度”而非无尽增长。**天主教整体经济学**（Catholic integral economics: 将自然资源视为“亲属”而非商品）将森林和河流视为“亲属”，而非商品。这些传统孕育了一种根本不同的经济学方法，一种支持**三大复兴**（three great restorations: 生态恢复、经济恢复、内在恢复）的方法：生态恢复，治愈我们星球受伤的系统；经济恢复，在不破坏的前提下重塑价值交换方式；以及内在恢复，在绝望威胁要缩小我们对可能性的视野时，更新我们的道德想象力。

在我自己为银行和非政府组织提供可持续伊斯兰金融咨询的工作中，我亲眼见证了这一点如何能够规模化，这相当令人难以置信。如果到2030年，预计八万亿美元伊斯兰金融市场中仅有5%投资于气候韧性，那将代表着4000亿美元用于再生基础设施。这并非慈善，这是恢复了互惠。因此，如果你塑造着经济的未来，尤其是我们这些身处董事会和机构中的人，请尝试这样做：对你的下一个重大决策进行一次“精神审计”。不仅要问“这是否能产生可持续的回报”，更要问“这是否为三大复兴做出了贡献？”因为市场，如同我们的灵魂，也在等待着配得上我们所面临的门槛时刻的指示。

<summary>Original English</summary>
And I've actually already shared
the first one with you.
It's that faith functions
as a collapse navigation system.
These traditions that are
sometimes dismissed as archaic
actually hold the key
to civilization's continuity.
Think about it.
These traditions survived
multiple plagues, empires, endless wars,
and even mini ice ages
serving as civilizational black boxes
for these uncertain times.
Times like these,
when we face different interpretations
about what this moment means
and who it calls us to become.
And faith traditions can offer us
some guidance through this uncertainty.
So I invite you
to think about those moments
when you practice in something
that is actually older than markets
and older than nations.
Those daily practices
etched into human muscle memory
long before borders and currencies
defined our exchanges.
These traditions aren't just relics,
they are your navigation technologies
tested through collapse after collapse.
So ask yourself: What ancient
algorithm of survival am I carrying?
Because the wisdom we now need
is not just waiting for us
in new inventions,
but it's also encoded
in these daily practices
that have sustained human dignity
across history's hardest passages.
Yet we also know that even the most
sophisticated navigation technologies
require accurate data
about where we truly stand.
And this brings me to the next insight.
It's radical honesty.
A truth that is always surprising
about climate action
is that it begins with a paradox.
We must look inwards
before we can effectively act outwards.
I love how the tradition
of Hazrat Inayat Khan
in the Sufi tradition
teaches that our true work
involves reconciling the irreconcilable,
and climate action
needs that same reconciliation.
Now let's be real.
We've all become experts
at identifying external obstacles.
Political gridlock,
corporate interests, colonial legacies.
All very real.
But faith traditions invite us
to look at a more subtle barrier:
our own contradictions.
Hypocrisy isn't just a sin,
it's a GPS pin that can point us
to deeper transformation.
Islam calls this Mahasabha,
Hinduism -- Svadhyaya.
Whatever the language,
the practice is constant.
Hold up a mirror and name the gap
between the world we dream about
and the ones our actions create.
Whether it's the climate activist
always flying to summits
or the congregation preaching stewardship
while their endowment
funds fossil fuel expansion.
These aren't necessarily
disqualifications,
but they're doorways
to deeper authenticity.
And radical honesty should also apply
to the continuous examination
of the value systems
that we hold most sacred.
I know that faith traditions
that also birthed liberation movements
sanctified colonial conquest.
And also today’s climate activism,
with all of its moral clarity,
can still become rigid, dogmatic
and blind to its own contradictions.
So tonight, let us ask ourselves:
Where do our actions cast shadows
on the very values
that we hold most sacred?
Can you think of an example
from your own life?
Now this question isn’t meant
to shame us, but to free us,
for it's precisely when we stand
in these tender spaces of contradiction
that moral courage can emerge.
And when we apply the same
radical honesty to economic systems,
we arrive at our next insight.
It's what I like to call
the systemic sacred.
It's when our deepest values
and our economic choices converge.
Now if you look back throughout history,
you'll see that both faith and commerce
together have shaped civilizations.
When they diverge, cultures can tear.
But when they harmonize,
cultures can bloom.
Judaism Shmita cycle
embeds ecological rest
and debt forgiveness
into economic rhythms and life.
Buddhist economics emphasizes
sufficiency over endless growth.
Catholic integral economics
recognizes forests and rivers
as kin rather than commodities.
Out of these traditions emerges
a fundamentally different
approach to economics,
one that supports
the three great restorations:
ecosystem restoration,
healing our planet’s wounded systems;
economic restoration,
reimagining how we exchange value
without extraction;
and inner restoration,
renewing our moral imagination
when despair threatens to narrow
our vision of what is actually possible.
Now in my own work advising banks and NGOs
on sustainable Islamic finance,
I've actually seen how this can scale,
and it's pretty incredible.
If just five percent
of the projected eight-trillion-dollar
Islamic finance market by 2030
is invested in climate resilience,
that represents 400 billion dollars
for regenerative infrastructure.
Now that is not charity.
That's reciprocity restored.
So if you shape economic future,
especially those of us
in boardrooms and institutions,
try this:
subject your next big decision
to a spiritual audit.
Ask not just will this generate
sustainable returns,
but does this contribute
to the three great restorations?
Because markets, like our souls,
are also waiting for instructions worthy
of the threshold moment that we face.

### 美的力量、灵魂的审视与更新之路

而经济学关乎我们的物质交换，我最后想分享的洞见，则照亮了更为微妙的层面：**美的力量**（the power of beauty: 指美在指引方向和激发希望方面的作用），它能在确定性失效时指引我们。如果我们倒着阅读人类今天的历史，它或许始于我们对美的拆毁。我们将森林变成木材，将动物变成生产单位，从孩童眼中榨取惊奇，并破坏我们与自然世界的关系。但我想知道，如果我们的后代将一个不同的起点识别为这段故事的开端，那将是多么令人惊叹——那时我们重新发现了美是生存的必需品。

巴哈伊信仰教导我们，美是神圣属性的显现。禅宗的**侘寂**（wabi-sabi: 日式美学，欣赏不完美、无常和不完整的状态）在不完美中发现美。神道教尊崇万物有灵，从山峦到路边石，它们都认识到一个共同的教训：我们很少会去保护那些我们尚未学会欣赏其真正美的事物。但美与保护之间的关系更为深远。许多信仰传统教导，在气候危机时期，神圣的援助并非来自“上方”，而是以希望和美的形式，存在于人类心中。先知们不仅预言了更美好的世界，他们更是通过言行将希望化为现实。他们的想象力是务实的，描绘出仅凭理性思维无法看见的路径。

所以，下次当你遇到一个美的时刻，它可能就是以最纯粹形式降临的神圣援助。八世纪伊拉克神秘主义者**拉比阿·阿尔-巴斯里**（Rabi’a al-Basri）深谙此道，她对上帝说：“我心中的希望，是最稀有的宝藏。” 思考一下：这个美的时刻是否正试图向我展示一个更充满希望的未来，但它迫切需要我的声音和言语来使其成为现实？

请注意，这一切都不是对气候现实的逃避。而是在不确定的时代，一种激进的信任行为。因为我坚信，我们的气候紧急状态，是对我们**灵魂的审视**（examination of the soul: 指对人类内在本质、价值观和道德的深刻反思）。每一次生态破坏背后的力量，都源于那个同样孕育着慈悲、公正和修复的人类之心。这是一种抽象的灵性，关乎我们在已知世界的边缘将成为谁。

或许你们中有些人也在疑惑：这一切有意义，我必须是宗教人士吗？不。当绝望污染天空时，从任何智慧传统中借取勇气，不仅是被允许的，更是必要的。信仰传统仅仅是非常古老的实验室，它们足够长久地亮着灯，记录下了行之有效的方法。我见过寺庙社区修复着曾导致他们家园被淹没的圣河；见过母亲们在炮火下种植橄榄树，只为让她们的孩子知道和平的味道。

所以……我们站在这里，站在我们最具决定性意义的门槛上。借用《创世记》的一课，我们人类挑战的核心是：要荣耀我们对大地的承诺，而不是摧毁世界。而这个门槛时刻，邀请我们所有人去实现这一承诺。此刻，**毁灭之门**（door of destruction）很容易找到。**更新之门**（door of renewal）则悄无声息。那么……当我们一起跨越这道门槛时，我们将成为谁？感谢聆听。

And while economics relates
to our material exchanges,
the final insight I'd like to share
illuminates something
a little bit more subtle.
It's the power of beauty
to guide us when certainty fails.
If we read today's story
of humanity backwards,
it might actually just begin
with us dismantling beauty.
We turn forests into lumber,
animals into production units,
we extract wonder from children's eyes
and break our relationship
with the natural world.
But I wonder, wouldn't it be amazing
if our descendants identified
a different starting point for this story?
When we rediscovered beauty
as essential for survival.
Baha'i teachings teach that beauty
are divine attributes made visible.
Zen Buddhism's wabi-sabi
sees beauty in imperfection.
Shinto honors a spirit in everything
from mountains to roadside stones,
and all recognize a common lesson
that we rarely protect
what we haven't first learned
to appreciate in its true beauty.
But this relationship
between beauty and protection
goes even deeper.
Many faith traditions teach
that divine assistance
in times of climate crisis
arrives not from above,
but as the presence of hope and beauty
within the human heart.
Prophets didn't just
predict better worlds,
they spoke and acted
their hope into being.
Their imagination was practical,
imagining paths invisible
to rational thought alone.
So the next time
you encounter a moment of beauty,
it might just be divine assistance
arriving in its purest form.
The eighth century mystic
Rabi’a al-Basri from Iraq
really understood this
when she said to God,
"Your hope in my heart
is the rarest treasure."
To reflect on what if
this moment of beauty
is trying to show me
a more hopeful future,
but desperately needs my voice
and words to bring it into being?
Now
none of this, let me tell you,
is a distraction from our climate reality.
But it's a radical act of trust
in uncertain times,
because I truly believe
our climate emergency
is an examination of the soul.
The same forces behind
each ecological destruction
arise from the same human heart
that also houses mercy,
justice and repair.
This is an abstract spirituality.
It's about who we become
at the edge of everything we know.
And some of you might also be wondering,
must I be religious
for any of this to matter?
No.
When despair is polluting the skies,
borrowing courage
from any wisdom tradition
is not only permitted, but necessary.
Faith traditions are simply
very old laboratories
that kept the lights on long enough
to record what worked.
I've seen temple communities
restoring the same sacred rivers
that contributed to the flooding
of their own homes,
and mothers planting olive trees
under bombardment
so that their children
may know what peace tastes like.
So ...
here we stand
at our most consequential threshold.
To borrow a lesson
from the Book of Genesis,
the heart of our human challenge
is to honor our promise to the earth,
not to destroy the world.
And this threshold moment
invites all of us to rise to that promise.
The door of destruction right now
is very easy to find.
The door of renewal
is quiet.
So ...
Who will we become together
as we cross this threshold?
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
