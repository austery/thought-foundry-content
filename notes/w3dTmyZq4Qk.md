### 肠道与大脑的深层联系

**主持人**: 研究表明，如果你使用牙线，可以将患痴呆症的风险降低近一半，这相当令人印象深刻。所以我开始更多地研究大脑，这让我意识到大脑和肠道之间的联系绝对至关重要，以及它如何影响我们大脑中的许多方面。例如，抑郁、情绪变化、疲劳和精力。但在过去的40年里，我们一直走在错误的道路上。我们过于专注于将大脑视为与身体其他部分截然不同的东西。那么，如果我们想拥有最健康的大脑，我们该怎么做呢？**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**是全球被引用次数最多的百位科学家之一，他将再次揭示我们的肠道在身体和心理健康、认知以及预防慢性疾病方面所扮演的关键角色。

**Host**: Studies showed that if you are flossing, you can reduce your risk of dementia by nearly half, which is quite impressive. So I started to research the brain much more and it made me realize this link with the brain and the gut is absolutely crucial and how that influences many things in our brain. For example, things like depression, mood changes, fatigue and energy. But for 40 years, we've been going down the wrong path. We've got so distracted by treating the brain as something so different to the rest of the body. So, what do we do about it if we want to have optimally healthy brains? So, **Professor Tim Spectre** is one of the top 100 most cited scientists worldwide, and he's back to reveal the critical role our gut plays with our physical and mental health,

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我们的认知以及慢性疾病的预防。我们只需做出正确的食物选择，就能极大地改善我们的生活和健康。我有八条肠道健康法则，它们适用于所有健康状况。首先，调整你的蛋白质摄入。然后是质量，而不是卡路里。通过卡路里评估食物的整个想法是错误的。事实证明，绝大多数人的卡路里限制饮食是无效的。你的饥饿信号会上升，而饥饿是肥胖的主要驱动因素。我们稍后会深入探讨其他法则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: our cognition, and the prevention of chronic disease. We can dramatically improve our lives and our health just by making the right food choices. And I've got eight rules for gut health which work for all health. So, first thing, pivot your protein. Then there's quality, not calories. The whole idea of assessing food by calories is wrong. Calorie restricted diets have been shown for the vast majority of people not to work. Your hunger signals go up. And hunger is the main driver of obesity. And we'll get into the other rules.

**主持人**: 咖啡呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what about coffee?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 每天喝两到五杯咖啡可以降低患心脏病的风险约25%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So drinking between two and five cups of coffee reduces your risk of heart disease by about 25%.

</details>

**主持人**: 那你觉得杏仁怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And then what do you think of almonds?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 有很多研究表明它们对你的认知和情绪有益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So there's lots of studies showing that they're good for your cognition and mood.

</details>

**主持人**: 那你对像Zen这样的**GLP-1s**有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what about your views on **GLP1s** like Zen?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我认为从公共卫生的角度来看，它们将改变医学，我们应该更加认真地对待它们。但我对它们有两个真正的担忧。我的第一个担忧是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I think from a public health perspective, they're going to transform medicine and we ought to be taking it much more seriously. But I've got two real worries about them. My first worry is that

### 痴呆症与大脑健康

**主持人**: **蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**。这位可爱的女士是谁？她如何与你目前关注的工作联系起来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: **Professor Tim Spectre**. Who is um who's this lovely lady and how does she tie into the work you're focused on right now?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 那是我可爱的妈妈，**琼**，她今年93岁，仍然健在。哇。但在过去的七年里，她在伦敦的一家养老院，因为中风后患上了痴呆症。所以，是的，这改变了我对生活的一些看法。她非常支持安乐死，签署了所有可能的文件，如果她发生这种情况，她希望能结束自己的生命。但不幸的是，这没有实现，根据英国法律，无法在这方面帮助她，因为她很早就失去了能力和行动力。所以，她还在那里，但她已经不认识我了。这提醒着我们潜在的未来生活，以及现在有那么多的人最终会患上痴呆症，这在50年前并非如此。如果我能做些什么来逆转这场痴呆症的流行，那对我来说真的很有动力，这也是我开始比过去更多地研究大脑的一个原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: That's my lovely mom, **June**, who is still with us, age 93. Wow. but for the last seven years has been in a in a home in London after suffering a stroke and uh then developing dementia and so um yeah that's um changed some of my views on life and uh she was really pro- uh euthanasia and signed every paper possible that if this ever happened to her you know she would be able to end her life but Unfortunately, that didn't come true and under UK law, it's not possible to to help her in that because she lost capability and mobility very early. So, she's still there, but she doesn't no longer recognizes me. And um it's it's a reminder of you know our potential future life and uh how so many so many people in the are going to end up with dementia that wasn't the case 50 years ago. If I can do something to reverse this epidemic of dementia, then that's really motivating for me and in a way one reason why I've started to research the brain much more than I I've done in the past.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，痴呆症是在增加，还是我们现在对它了解更多，所以我们更擅长诊断它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, is dementia increasing or is it that we know of it more now? So, we're better at diagnosing it.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它正在增加，原因有很多。其中一部分是人口结构的老龄化。我们活得更久了，但我们活得并不健康。所以我们的健康寿命并没有真正增加，但我们的寿命增加了。我们擅长让老年人活得更久，这绝对是真的。但也有数据显示，即使考虑到这一点，它仍在增加。所以患痴呆症的人比以往任何时候都多，即使你考虑了人口结构和其他变化。所以这是一个主要的担忧，我认为这是我们所有人最大的恐惧之一。你知道，显然癌症是一种恐惧，但我认为另一个真正糟糕的是最终患上痴呆症，因为几乎每个人都认识患有痴呆症的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: It's increasing for a number of reasons. So some of it is the age demographic. So we're living longer, but we're not living healthier. So our health span hasn't really increased, but our lifespan has. We're good at keeping elderly people alive longer. That's definitely true, but there's also stats to show that it is increasing even when you take that into account. So that more people are developing uh dementia than ever before, even when you account for the demographics. and those other changes. So, it is a major worry and I think it's one of the the major fears that all of us have. You know, obviously you've got cancer is one fear, but I think the other really bad one is ending up with dementia because nearly everyone knows somebody with dementia.

</details>

**主持人**: 这是否激励你去做了自己的大脑扫描？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Did this inspire you to go get your own brain scanned?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，如你所知，我以前大脑有问题。我在2011年曾患过一次小中风，但从未真正找出原因。我知道我大脑里有一些白斑。我想看看它们是否还在那里，是否有任何迹象。同时，我也想做一次检查，看看我是否会像我母亲一样，以及我是否患有这种疾病的遗传形式。是单纯的**阿尔茨海默病**，还是更像我母亲患的或可能患的**血管性痴呆**。所以，是的，部分是出于我的医学好奇心，部分是出于自身利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes, I'd had, as you know, problems with my brain before. I'd had a mini stroke back in 2011 and never really worked out the causes of that. I knew I had some white spots in my brain. I wanted to see if they were still there, if there were any signs of that. And at the same time, I wanted to get a checkup to see was I likely to end up like my mother or not. And did I have the genetic form of the disease? Was it a straightforward Alzheimer's or was it more the vascular type that my mother had or probably has? And so yeah, partly it was motivated out of my cur my medical curiosity and partly for self-interest.

</details>

**主持人**: 你发现了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what did you find?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我去了伦敦一家专门做痴呆症筛查的诊所，所以我知道我是否有**阿尔茨海默病**的风险基因，幸运的是我没有。但是，我确实有糖尿病和心脏病的坏基因，这使我容易患上**血管性痴呆**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I went to this specialized clinic in London that does these dementia screens, so I know if I had the risk genes for Alzheimer's, which luckily I don't. Um, but I do have bad genes for diabetes and heart disease, which predispose you to the vascular side of things.

</details>

**主持人**: 什么是**血管性痴呆**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What's vascular dementia?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 痴呆症有几种类型，但主要有两种：**阿尔茨海默病**，大脑中会出现蛋白质折叠，局部炎症，这些蛋白质缠结，然后导致大脑某些部位受损。这是一种非常特殊的痴呆症。然后是更普遍的痴呆症，通常称为**血管性痴呆**，就像心脏一样，大脑供血动脉堵塞。这会以比**阿尔茨海默病**略微更随机的方式损害大脑的其他部分。虽然预测性稍差，但它占所有痴呆症的三分之一左右。我之所以容易患上它，是因为2011年那次奇怪的事件后，我的血压升高了。所以，任何高血压的人通常动脉都比大多数人僵硬一些，这会影响大脑中的动脉。所以，你的风险会稍微高一些。而且，由于我从祖母那里继承的糖尿病基因，我患**血管性痴呆**的风险更高。所以，我想做的就是了解这些，以便优化我能做的一切，尽可能地推迟或预防它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: There's several types of dementia, but the two main ones are Alzheimer's, where you get these protein folds in the brain. you get local inflammation, these protein tangles, and that then causes these damage to the bits of the brain. That's a very specific type of dementia. Then you get more generalized dementia, which is usually called vascular dementia, where you're just getting clogging up of the arteries supplying the brain just like you do in the heart. And that knocks off other bits of the brain uh in a slightly more random way than happens uh with Alzheimer's. Slightly less predictable, but that accounts for about a third of all dementia is this vascular time. I'm predisposed to it because after my this weird episode in 2011, my blood pressure went up. So anyone with high blood pressure generally has slightly stiffer arteries than most people and that impacts the arteries in your brain. So, you are slightly more at risk. And with these diabetes genes that I've got, thanks to my grandmother, I am more at risk of vascular dementia. And so, what I wanted to do was learn about that in order to optimize all the things I could do to postpone it or prevent it as much as possible.

### 大脑的整体观与肠道连接

**主持人**: 在过去的五年左右，你对大脑的兴趣增加了。你现在对大脑的看法与五年前你开始研究并对此感兴趣之前有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Over the last 5 years or so, your interest in the brain has increased. What what is the the the variance in your views of the brain now versus five years ago before you started doing research and getting interested in it?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我认为我以前把大脑看作一个相当独立的器官，它是精神病学和可能研究痴呆症的老年病学家的领域，它并不是大局的一部分，当然也不在我的专业领域内。我那时仍然相信**笛卡尔**关于心智与大脑、心智与身体区别的观点，认为它们是两个独立的实体，之间有一道屏障，即**血脑屏障**，就像一道铁幕。所以我对它感兴趣，但我没有意识到我现在发现的这种巨大联系，这真的让我很兴奋。我认为触发这一切的是我们自己的一些实验，这些实验有点偶然。当我们启动**Zoey**时，我们进行了一些试验，并给参与者提供了应用程序，让他们报告自己的感受。在我们进行的每一项研究中，我们都得到了令人难以置信的结果，人们说当他们开始**Zoey**饮食时，例如，他们首先注意到的是情绪和精力得到改善，饥饿感也减轻了。这发生在任何血液变化和肠道变化之前。所以最初我们有点不以为然，但它发生在我们进行的每一项研究中。我们研究了更年期。同样，当人们通过食物改善肠道健康来缓解更年期症状时，最显著的变化是在情绪和精力方面。因为我最初是一名风湿病学家，对炎症非常感兴趣。我从未将身体和关节中的炎症与大脑中发生的事情联系起来。突然间，当我阅读最新的科学文献时，一切都变得如此清晰。它真的变成了，你知道，关于抑郁、情绪变化、疲劳和精力这些新想法，我以前从未将其视为大脑的某种功能障碍，以错误的方式回应来自身体其他部分的信号。但突然间，所有这些都聚焦于整个系统的整体性，以及大脑实际上只是另一个器官。而与肠道的这种联系绝对至关重要，因为大脑大部分信息都来自那里。你知道，我们有一条从肠道通向大脑的**迷走神经**，它是身体最长的神经。80%的信号是从肠道传向大脑的，只有20%是从大脑传向肠道的。所以所有这些事情加在一起，让我意识到进入我们肠道的东西，我们的饮食是多么重要，以及它如何影响我们大脑中我以前没有联系起来的许多事情。我认为大多数医学界以前也没有联系起来。我们都把大脑放在一个神圣的地位，我应该这么说。你知道，我们认为它是一个独特的、驱动我们身体的东西，但实际上并非如此。它只是像其他任何器官一样对它们做出反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I think I saw the brain as a rather distinct organ that uh was the domain of psychiatry and you know perhaps gerontologists who look at dementia that wasn't really part of the major picture and certainly wasn't within my domain of expertise. I think I still believe in this the **Cartesian view** of the difference between the mind and the brain the mind and the body that these two separate entities and you've got this barrier between them this **blood brain barrier** that was really like an iron curtain. So I I was interested in it but I didn't realize this huge connection I've now discovered really that um has really excited me and I think the thing that triggered it was some of our own experiments which happened a bit by chance. So when we started **Zoey**, we did a number of trials and we gave our participants apps so they could report how they felt. In every study we did, we started getting back these incredible results of people saying when they were when they started the **Zoey** diet, for example, the first thing they noticed was their mood and energy improved and their hunger uh got less. And that was before any blood changes, before any gut changes. And so initially we slightly discounted it, but it happened in every study we did. We'd looked at the menopause. And again, the most dramatic change when people were improving their gut health through food with menopausal symptoms was was on mood and energy. Because originally I'm a rheatologist uh and was really interested in inflammation. I'd never put that connection between what was inflammation in the body and in your joints with what was going on in your brain. And suddenly the latest science when I'm going away you doing my reading is making it all so so much clearer. It's it's really become, you know, this this new idea of things like depression, things like mood changes, things like fatigue and energy, which I hadn't really thought about as in a way a malfunction of the brain, responding the wrong way to signals from the rest of the body. But it it suddenly all comes into focus about how holistic the whole system is and how really the brain is just another organ. And this link with the gut is absolutely crucial because that's where it gets most of its information from. You know, we have this **vagus nerve** that goes from our gut to our brain, the longest nerve in the body. And 80% of the signals go gut to brain. Only 20% go brain to gut. So all these things together have just made me realize how important what going into our gut is, our diet is, and how that influences many things in our brain that I didn't put together before. And I don't think most most of the medical world have put together before. And it we've all got the brain on a pedestal, I should say. You know, we we think it's this some this unique thing that's driving our bodies, but actually it's not. It's just responding to them just like any other organ.

</details>

**主持人**: 这让我反思那些情绪好坏的日子，以及它与我前几天饮食的关联程度，我的感受。睡眠是影响我感受的一个非常大的加剧因素，但如果我睡好了但仍然感觉不好，我认为这通常与我一直在吃的东西或最近24小时内吃的东西有关。所以当你谈到这种整体图景，以及我的大脑可能，我想我记不起你用的词了，但听起来你好像说我的大脑正在接收来自身体其他部分的信号，并且根据这些信号出现某种故障，导致抑郁、焦虑、坏情绪等等。我认为这真的很有趣，因为人们认为情绪是独立的东西。我们不认为情绪与我的肠道有关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It made me reflect on the days that I've had like good and bad moods and how how much it's linked to my diet in the preceding couple of days like how I feel. If I sleep is such a big exacerbating factor in how I feel, but if I'm slept and I still don't feel good, it's typically linked I think to something I've been eating or something I've eaten very recently maybe in the last 24 hours. So when you talk about how there's this holistic picture and how my brain might be I think I can't remember the words you used but but it sounded like you said my brain is receiving signals from other parts of my body and it's kind of malfunctioning based on those signals which is causing depression, anxiety, bad moods, whatever. That I think is really interesting because people think of mood as a separate thing. We don't think of mood connected to my gut.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 不，这是你自己的错。你心情不好。你为什么心情不好？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: No, it's it's your own fault. You're in a bad mood. Why are you in a bad mood?

</details>

**主持人**: 发生了一些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Something happened.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 外界因素。比如有人在交通中超了你的车，或者其他什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Externally. So someone cut you off in traffic or whatever it might be.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所有这些研究，我们现在有四项研究，我们正在改变人们的饮食，他们通常饮食很差，我们让他们转向健康的饮食，他们首先注意到的是情绪，特别是精力水平的改善。他们以前从未像你一样，将情绪和精力水平与饮食等因素联系起来。他们认为这是内在的，觉得“哦，这只是因为我，你知道，我的生活或别的什么。”一个极端的例子是我们正在与一些家庭合作，制作**Channel 4**的系列节目《什么不该吃》，我们拜访了四个家庭，他们的饮食习惯很糟糕，我们改变了他们，给他们提供了对肠道友好的饮食改造。六周后观察他们。他们首先注意到的是情绪和精力显著增加。他们以前总是打盹，白天总是睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: all these studies, you know, we've got four studies now where we're changing people's diets and they're going, they've been on generally bad diets, we've moved them to good diets that mood and particularly energy levels, the first thing they noticed, they're improving. And they never linked, just like you, their mood and energy levels with things like diet. It was just inherent. They thought, "Oh, it's just cuz I'm, you know, my life's or whatever it is." An extreme example is some families we've been working with doing a **Channel 4** series at the moment called What Not to Eat and we visit four families and they're terrible diets and we transform them, give them a gut friendly makeover diet. Look at them after 6 weeks. The first thing they all notice is their mood and energy is dramatically increased. They were napping all the time. They were asleep all the time during the day.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们都吃了些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What were they eating?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 垃圾食品。高度加工的垃圾食品，晚上还吃零食。巧克力棒，你知道，苏打水，鸡块，杯面，垃圾食品，对吧？所以，这些比一般情况更糟糕，但仍然有数百万人这样做。他们完全不知道这与他们一直感觉很糟很累有关。同样，首先改善的是他们大脑中发生的事情，他们突然又感到警觉了。一旦人们意识到这种联系，那么在某种程度上，你就会有一个反馈循环，说“好吧，我不会吃这种食物，因为我知道它让我感觉很糟。”但除非你建立这种联系，否则你不会知道。你只会一直处于这种状态，说“好吧，你知道，我只是超重，所以我很累。”或者“我没有锻炼，所以我很累。”这里有一个恶性循环：吃不好的东西，然后精力不足，整天睡觉，感觉不好。所以你又吃不好的东西，循环继续。因为如果我感觉不好，我可能想吃一块巧克力棒。在我们的**Zoey**研究中，我们发现睡眠不好的人早上会极度渴望一些含糖的垃圾食品。对吧？你不会首先选择健康的早餐。就好像你大脑里有个小小的邪恶东西在说：“嗯，好吧，我需要快速解决一下。我不在乎一天的其余时间。只要让我度过接下来的一个小时就行。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Crap food. Highly processed crap food and snacking late at night. Bars of chocolate, you know, sodas, chicken nuggets, pot noodles, rubbish food, right? So, these were more worse than your average, but still there's millions of people like that doing this. And they had no clue that it was linked to them feeling terrible and tired all the time. And again the first thing that improved was what was going on in their brains and they suddenly felt alert again. And once people realize there's connection then in a way you'd have this feedback loop to say okay I'm not going to eat this food you know because I know it's making me feel so sick. But until you make that connection you're not going to know. you'll just be in this constant state saying, well, you know, I'm just overweight, that's why I'm tired. Uh, or I'm not exercising, that's why I'm tired. There's a bit of a vicious cycle here with eating something bad, then being low energy and sleeping all day, not feeling good. So, you eat something bad and the cycle continues. Cuz if I don't feel good, I probably want to eat a chocolate bar. In our **Zoe** studies, we found that people who had a bad night's sleep desperately craved some sugary crap in the morning. Right? It's the first you don't go for a healthy breakfast. It's like there's some little evil thing in your brain saying, "Um, okay, I need a quick fix. I don't care about the rest of the day. Just get me through the next hour."

### 炎症、免疫系统与情绪

**主持人**: 你知道吗？我播客上有人提出，那是因为你的身体基本上处于一种压力之下。所以从进化的角度来看，如果你因为某种原因半夜醒来或者睡眠不好，那可能是因为你受到了威胁。所以你的大脑需要能量。现在有很多研究表明，我们以前认为是外部心理事件的压力，实际上是一种生理事件，并且正在驱动炎症。它直接影响你的免疫系统，然后免疫系统向你的大脑发送这些信号，改变你的行为。我认为这在抑郁症中似乎正在发生的核心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do you know Do you know what that I had someone posit on my podcast that um that was because your body's basically under a form of stress. So from an evolutionary perspective, if if you're waking up in the middle of the night for some reason or you weren't sleeping properly, it might be because you were under threat. So your brain wants energy. So there a lot of studies now that stress, which we thought of as a sort of external psychological event, is actually a physiological one and is actually driving inflammation. It's directly affecting your immune system, which is then sending these signals to your brain to change your behavior. And this I think is very much the heart of what seems to be happening, you know, in depression.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我发现的是，它正在检测免疫系统的变化。它正在切换到压力模式。然后压力模式会触发你大脑中的这些不同行为。而且通常情况下，这不是真正的压力。我的意思是，我们每天遇到的压力大多不像我们祖先遇到的那样。我们没有被野生动物追赶，也没有被烧出村庄。所以，真正让我感兴趣的是疫苗接种时发生的事情之间的整个联系。在**Zoey**期间，我们研究了数百万人对**辉瑞**和**阿斯利康**疫苗的反应。真正有趣的是，人们在那段时间里实际上感到抑郁。所以你会有大约24小时的抑郁，这模仿了一种更持续的威胁。这突然让我明白了，你可以通过免疫系统的一个小小的转变来触发抑郁。现在有一个越来越流行的理论，关于长期抑郁症患者，他们的免疫变化被激活，所以他们正在经历相当于疫苗对免疫系统持续刺激的情况。所以对我来说，这是一件非常重要的事情，因为我接种疫苗。我定期接种疫苗。我坚信疫苗，但它们确实会让你感到有点沮丧。这是有道理的，因为你的血液检查会显示炎症蛋白飙升。你的免疫系统正在启动。这会向你的大脑发送信号。你的大脑会说：“好吧，我好像要生病了。”这种疾病行为在某些人身上会持续数月或数年。这正在发展出一种全新的理论，解释为什么人们会抑郁，这与旧的化学失衡理论不同。它实际上是你的身体对正常的反应做出异常反应。它认为自己受到了攻击。你的大脑认为自己受到了攻击。然后它应该关闭并保护你。我发现这很吸引人，我们现在将这么多东西与免疫系统联系起来，而精神和脑部疾病的免疫基础正变得极其重要。我相信你在播客中谈论了很多关于炎症以及控制免疫系统的作用，因为如果你的免疫系统失控，你的炎症水平很高，你的身体就无法自我修复。所以大脑的衰老速度会加快。所有这些都指向炎症对一切都至关重要，特别是大脑健康的各个方面。当我去看的时候，你真的会发现免疫系统在他们研究过的每一种脑部疾病中都扮演着角色。然而我们却错过了它，因为我们一直痴迷于**百忧解**通过**血清素**或**多巴胺**起作用的方式。在过去的40年里，我们一直走在错误的道路上，错过了这种整体观，即它实际上是关于炎症与代谢的结合。因为这里的另一个重要因素，也是很多人患痴呆症的原因，是血糖控制不佳，以及大脑的能量供应控制不佳。所以这两件事对我来说改变了我对大脑健康的看法。我以前研究遗传学，如你所知，有趣的是，当我们研究双胞胎时，他们在大多数方面都非常相似，但当我们研究脑部疾病时，双胞胎之间的相似性非常小。所以遗传成分总是很小，除了一些疾病。大多数疾病的遗传力都很低。瑞典有一项大规模研究。他们研究了数百万对兄弟姐妹，并研究了他们所有的精神健康或我更喜欢称之为脑部疾病。即使在数百万人的研究中，也没有发现任何基因能够真正解释这些疾病，除了患任何类型脑部疾病的普遍倾向。所以他们称之为**P因子**。如果你有这种普遍的易感性，你可能会患上任何疾病，但这可能是躁狂症、抑郁症、躁郁症、**多动症**，也可能是**阿尔茨海默病**、**精神分裂症**，这突然改变了你对这些疾病的整体看法。我们以前认为这些是独立的疾病，应该始终分开看待。如果你开始将大脑视为一个器官，就像其他任何器官一样，比如肝脏，你会说，“好吧，我们谈论肝病，你知道，如何预防肝病？”我们从不在脑部疾病中谈论这个问题。我们只是说，“好吧，你必须以不同的方式谈论躁狂抑郁症，与**多动症**或**人格障碍**或**癫痫**或其他任何疾病不同。”但事实证明，它们不仅有相似的基因，而且有非常相似的风险因素。

**Professor Tim Spectre**: What I've been finding out is that it's detecting a change in the immune system. It's switching on to the stress mode. And the stress mode then triggers these different behaviors in your brain. And very often it's not, you know, real stress. I mean most of the stresses we get it every day are not like our ancestors had. Uh we're not being chased by wild animals or um being burnt out of our village, you know. So the and what really interested me was this whole link between what happens when uh you have a vaccination. During **Zoe**, we looked at a million people's responses to the if you remember the the **FISA** and uh vaccine and the **SK** vaccine. And what was really interesting was that uh people were actually depressed during that time. So you had about 24 hours of depression which was mimicking um a more constant threat. And this suddenly brought home this idea that you can trigger depression through a little shift in your immune system. There's a really growing theory about people who have long-term depression is that these their immune changes are switched on so that they're getting the equivalent of this constant tickling of the immune system by a vaccine. So that to me is was was a really important thing because I I have vaccines. I have regular vaccines. I'm big believer in vaccines, but they do make you feel a little bit down. That makes sense cuz your blood tests will show a spike in your proteins for inflammation. Your immune system's kicking in. That sends signals to your brain. Your brain says, "Okay, I looks like I've got an illness coming here." That illness behavior in some people then gets carried on for months or years. And this is now developing this whole new theory of of why uh people are depressed which isn't the old theory of it's just due to a chemical imbalance. It's actually your body responding abnormally to a you know a normal response. It's it thinks it's under attack. Your brain thinks it's under attack. It should then shut down and protect you. This I find fascinating that we're now linking so much to the immune system and it's the immune basis of things of mental and brain diseases is becoming incredibly important. I'm sure you've talked on the podcast a lot about inflamming and the role of controlling the immune system because if your immune system is out of control you inflammation levels are high your body can't repair itself. So aging happens faster in the brain. All of these things are pointing to inflammation being crucial to everything, but particularly in all aspects of brain health. And when I went and looked, you can really find that the immune system has a role in every brain disease they've ever looked at. And yet we've missed it because we've been so obsessed with new, you know, the way that **Prozac** works by it just being about **serotonin** uh or **dopamine**. And for 40 years, we've been going down the wrong path and missing this holistic view that actually it's it's about inflammation paired with metabolism. Because the other big player here is and the reason a lot of people get dementia is blood sugar is not well controlled and the the energy supply to the brain is not well controlled. So those two things for me have transformed my view of of brain health. And I used to study genetics as you know and it was always interesting that in um when we looked at twins which were usually very similar for most things when we looked at at um brain diseases there was very little similarity in the twins. So the genetic component was always quite small apart from a few diseases. Most of them were really low-level uh what we call heritability. And there was a massive study in um Sweden. They looked at several million sibling pairs and s looked at all their mental health or brain diseases I prefer to call them. And there was no gene that really came out even in several million people that explained these disease other than a general tendency to get any type of brain disease. So they called you know this like **factor P**. Um, if you had this general susceptibility, you could get any disease, but that could be mania, depression, bipolar, **ADHD**, it could be Alzheimer's, it could be schizophrenia, which which suddenly changes your whole view of these these diseases. We've said these are individual um diseases that should always be looked at separately. And if you start thinking of this as the brain as a an organ just like anything else like it was the liver, you'd say, okay, we talk about liver disease, you know, how do you prevent liver disease? We never talk about that in brain disease. We just say, okay, you got to talk about manic depression differently to uh **ADHD** or personality disorder or epilepsy or whatever it is. But it turns out that not only have the similar genes, but really similar risk factors as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听你说过，你认为**帕金森病**始于肠道炎症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I've heard you say that you think Parkinson's disease starts in the gut as inflammation in the gut.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，这是一个很好的例子，说明我对这些疾病的看法正在改变。现在有非常好的流行病学数据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah, that's a great um example of how my view of these diseases changing. There's really good epidemiology data now. Um

</details>

**主持人**: 流行病学数据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: epidemiology data.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 流行病学数据是大量人群的数据。所以你通过研究人群来研究疾病的原因。这基本上就是流行病学。这些研究表明，如果你跟踪易感人群，并找出最终患上**帕金森病**的人，你会发现大约90%的**帕金森病**患者在10年前就有肠道问题。你可能会说，好吧，这可能不相关，可能是两回事，但他们实际上在**帕金森病**患者的大脑中发现了相同的蛋白质变化，这种特定的蛋白质会错误折叠。这有点类似于**阿尔茨海默病**，但它是一种不同的蛋白质，**α-突触核蛋白**，它会折叠，你会看到死后一种特征性的东西，叫做**路易小体**，但重要的是蛋白质折叠。如果你观察肠道，这些人在10年前不仅有便秘、腹胀和问题，肠道非常迟钝，而且他们的肠道中也发现了相同的错误折叠蛋白质。他们认为这些蛋白质需要10年才能通过**迷走神经**缓慢进入大脑，然后导致那里的问题。所以这是**帕金森病**背后的最新理论，它实际上始于肠道，并与肠道炎症有关。所以当肠道不健康时，这些蛋白质就开始折叠，这意味着你有可能通过对肠道友好的饮食来预防**帕金森病**。看起来证据正在积累，很快就会非常确凿。如果这是真的，那么你可能会想，还有哪些我们真正不了解的疾病可能起源于那里。**多发性硬化症**呢，它可能首先发生在那里？它真的开始将这些模糊的脑部疾病带回到身体其他部分以及那里发生的事情和这些代谢问题的领域。你知道，糖尿病是许多这些疾病的首要风险因素。所以，如果你患有**2型糖尿病**，你患脑部疾病的可能性会增加四倍。不仅是抑郁症，还有躁郁症、**精神分裂症**、**癫痫**，所有这些。所以它们显然是相互关联的。你身体里发生的事情，你吃的东西，你的免疫系统正在做的事情，都有这种惊人的连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Epidemiology data is data in large populations. Um so you study the cause of disease by studying populations. That's essentially what epidemiology is. And what these studies have shown is that if you follow susceptible people uh and find out who at the end ended up with **Parkinson's disease**, you will see that about 90% of people who end up with **Parkinson disease** had some gut problems 10 years before. And you might say, okay, well, might not be related, might be two separate things, but they've actually found the same protein changes in the brains in people with **Parkinson's disease**, this particular protein that gets misfolded. It's a bit equivalent to Alzheimer's but it's it's separate a separate type of protein **alpha sinuclean** and it gets folded and you get this characteristic thing you can see postmortem called a a **louisi body** but it's the protein folding that's important and if you look in the gut not only do these people have constipation and bloating and problems 10 years before a really sluggish uh intestine but they have the same proteins that are misfolded that you can find in their gut And they think that it takes 10 years for these proteins to go slowly up the **vagus nerve** into the brain and then it causes the problem there. So this is the the latest theory behind **Parkinson's disease** that it actually starts in the gut and it's related to inflammation in the gut. So these proteins start folding when the gut is not happy which means that you could potentially prevent **Parkinson's disease** by a gut friendly diet. It looks like it's the evidence is building that you know that's going to be pretty concrete soon. If that's true then you may think what other diseases might have that origin there that we um really don't understand. What about multiple scerosis that might happen there first? And it really starts to bring, you know, this obscure of these brain disease back into the domain of the rest of the body and what's going on there and these metabolic problems. You know, diabetes is the number one risk factor for so many of these conditions as well. So like if you got **type two diabetes**, you're like four times as more likely to have a brain disease. not only depression but also you know bipolar, schizophrenia, epilepsy, all of these ones. So clearly they're linked. They're this what goes on in your body, what you're eating, what what your immune system is doing has this amazing knock-on effect.

### 肠道健康的八大饮食法则

**主持人**: 那么我们该怎么办呢？普通人该怎么办？你知道，西方世界普通人的饮食是什么样的。如果我们想拥有最健康的大脑，并避免痴呆症、帕金森症以及其他一些与肠道相关的疾病，那么听众现在最应该考虑和做些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So what do we do about it? What does the average person do about it? You know, because the average you know what the average diet looks like in the western world. Um, if we want to have optimally healthy brains and avoid dementia, Parkinson's, and some of these other disorders that are linked to the gut, what is what is the most important thing the listener right now should be thinking about and doing?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，我喜欢认为我们有一个越来越长的清单，但我现在有八条肠道健康法则，它们几乎适用于所有健康状况，因为我们对待大脑，与对待身体其他部分并没有什么不同。如果你好好对待它，你就会没事。所以，第一件事是要注意你吃的东西。不要随便把任何旧东西放进嘴里，你知道吗？我的意思是，停下来想一想，“这里面有什么？它对我有好处吗？它会让我感觉如何？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Well, I like to think we got I've got a list that's getting longer, but it I've got now eight rules for gut health, which pretty much work for all health because we you to treat the brain. It's no really different to treating the rest of your body. If you treat that well, you're going to be fine. So, the first thing is to be mindful of what you're eating. Don't just put any old in your mouth, you know? I mean, stop for a bit and saying, "Is this what's in it? Is it any good for me? How's it going to make me feel?"

</details>

**主持人**: 你是说检查标签之类的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You mean checking labels and stuff?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 检查标签，甚至只是花一秒钟思考，你知道，天哪，不要像我们大多数人那样，盲目地坐在电视前吃东西而不思考你吃的是什么。第二点，可能也是最关键的一点，我认为是吃多样化的植物。每周30种植物。这30种植物为你提供了多样化的化学物质，可以作为肥料，让尽可能多的有益细菌进入你的系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Checking labels or even just taking a second to think, you know, gosh, don't just blindly eat in front of the TV without thinking what you're eating as we most of us do. Second, and probably the key thing is, I think, is to eat a diversity of plants. 30 plants a week. These 30 plants give you the diversity of chemicals to act as fertilizers for getting as many good bugs as you can into your system.

</details>

**主持人**: 你如何向对肠道不甚了解的人解释这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How can you explain that to someone that doesn't know much about the gut?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 当我谈论你的肠道时，我指的是肠道微生物。你的大肠里有40到100万亿个这些家伙，它们就像许多药房。我们有成千上万种不同的物种，所有这些物种都经过高度选择，只吃某些食物。例如，有一种只喜欢咖啡的细菌，叫做**Lorenabacta**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: When I'm talking about your gut, I'm talking about gut microbes. And there are 40 to 100 trillion of these guys in your mainly in your large intestine that are many pharmacies. And there we have thousands of different species, all of which highly selected to eat only certain foods. There's one that only likes coffee, for example, called **Lorenabacta**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我肚子里有一种只喜欢咖啡的细菌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: A bug that only likes coffee in my belly. It's

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它只是在等你喝咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: just waiting for you to drink coffee.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我喝咖啡时，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And when I drink coffee, what happens?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它会开派对，繁殖，然后通过将咖啡分解成其他成分来产生某些化学物质，这些化学物质可能会帮助你的免疫系统，并在某种程度上解释为什么咖啡对你的心脏有益。所以，你必须想象你有很多这样的细菌，它们高度特异性，不仅在等你喝咖啡，还在等你吃海藻，或者猴面包树果，或者你通常不吃的其他东西，这样我们就可以扩大我们有益细菌的清单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: It uh has a party, has sex, has babies, multiplies, and then produces certain chemicals in response by breaking down that coffee into other ingredients which might then help your immune system and um in some way explain why coffee is good for your heart. So, you got to imagine that you've got lots of bugs like that that are highly specific waiting for you to have uh not only coffee, but you know, maybe it's seaweed or maybe uh it's baobob or maybe it's things you don't often have uh so that we can expand our list of good bugs.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，如果我停止吃某种食物，比如咖啡，如果我停止喝咖啡，那种细菌会死吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, if I stop eating a particular food like coffee, if I stop having coffee, will that bug die?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它可能会降到非常低的水平，因为实际上有趣的是，即使你停止喝咖啡，你周围也有喝咖啡的人，他们的唾液飞沫、亲吻和问候意味着你会得到一些细菌本身，或者你会得到空气中的一些咖啡，咖啡的香气。好的。所以，细菌的数量会上下波动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: It probably goes down to very low levels because actually what's interesting is even if you stop drinking coffee, you're surrounded by coffee drinkers and they they're droplets of saliva and kisses and uh greetings mean that you'll be getting uh some of that either those bugs themselves or you'll be getting um some bits of coffee in the air, a coffee aroma. Okay. So, the bugs go up and down in population.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。所以，即使是不喝咖啡的人，我们也能看到少量这种**Lorsonacta**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yes. So, even in non- coffee drinkers, we do see tiny amounts of this uh this **Lorsonacta**.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，但在完全不喝咖啡的国家，例如一些非洲国家，它就不存在。所以，我认为重要的是要想象它有点像拥有一只稀有动物。你知道，你必须在你的动物园里喂养它们。你不想给它们都吃同样的食物。你必须给它们多样化的食物，这样所有稀有动物都能在那里生存。我们知道，你拥有的有益细菌越多，你的免疫系统就越好，你就能越有效地抑制炎症，你就能越有效地预防我们正在看到的所有这些问题。所以我们的目标是培养有益细菌。你培养得越多，它们就会挤走有害细菌，那些喜欢吃汉堡、垃圾食品、劣质脂肪和人工物质的细菌。所以你通过饿死它们来挤走它们，你通过正确喂养它们来做到这一点。这就是这个概念，如果这有道理的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Um but in countries that don't drink coffee at all, there are a few African countries for example where it doesn't ex um so it that's but I think it's important to imagine your it's a bit like having a rare animal. You know, you've got to feed in your zoo. You don't want to give them all the same food. You've got to give them this diversity so that all the rare animals can get out there. And we know that the more good bugs you've got, the better your immune system, the more you dampen inflammation, the more you can prevent all these problems that we're seeing. So our our aim is to build up the good bugs. And the more you build them up, they squash out the bad bugs, the ones that like eating the burgers and the the the bad food and the and the terrible quality fats and the artificial substances. So you're squashing them out by starving them and you do that by feeding them properly. That's the that's the concept if that makes sense.

</details>

**主持人**: 谈到咖啡，它难道不会限制流向大脑的血液吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And on that point of coffee, doesn't it restrict blood flow to your brain?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 不，据我所知不会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: No, not as far as I know.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，真的吗？嗯，我是在流行病学层面上谈论咖啡的。所以已经有多项研究，就像我说的，比较喝咖啡的人和不喝咖啡的人，看看他们20、30年后会发生什么，每天喝两到五杯咖啡可以降低患心脏病的风险约25%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Oh, really? Um I'm talking I know about coffee at the epidemiological level. So there have been multiple studies like I was saying between coffee drinkers, non- coffee drinkers, seeing what happens to them 20 30 years later and drinking between two and five cups of coffee reduces your risk of heart disease by about 25%.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以可能还有其他研究表明它对你的大脑有影响，但总的来说，我看到的一切都是有益的。我没有看到任何负面影响。尽管有些人对咖啡因反应不好，所以总是有个性化的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So there may be other studies showing it does something to your brain, but generally everything I've seen is beneficial. I've not seen anything negative. Although there are some people who react to caffeine badly, so there's always a a personalized element to it.

</details>

**主持人**: 睡眠中断之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sleep disruption and stuff.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。所以你可能是一个代谢者。它在你体内代谢不快。所以咖啡因会在体内停留更长时间。所以这只是对某些人来说的唯一缺点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. So you you might be a a metabolizer. It doesn't metabolize quickly in you. So that caffeine is hanging around longer. So they're the only downsides to it for some people.

</details>

**主持人**: 它会让你更焦虑吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Can it make you more anxious?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，我认为它会使一些人更焦虑。是的。嗯，这就是为什么像抹茶比咖啡更好，因为它们里面有一种额外的化学物质可以让你平静下来。所以，就像任何食物一样，它都是个性化的。所以，当我们谈论流行病学时，我们谈论的是普通人。嗯，这并不意味着没有例外。所以，我并不是说世界上每个人都需要喝咖啡，但咖啡曾经被妖魔化为会导致心脏病发作和心律失常的东西。而事实上，从流行病学上讲，情况恰恰相反，当你喝咖啡时，你实际上会减少心脏异常和心律失常的发生，原因我们仍然不清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Um I think it can make some people more anxious. Yes. Um, and that's that's why things like matcha are better than coffee because they have a an extra chemical in there that can calm you down. So, like anything, it any food, it's all personalized. And so, when we talk about epidemiology, we're talking about the average person. Um, doesn't mean there aren't aren't exceptions. So, I'm not saying that everybody in the world needs to have coffee, but coffee used to be demonized as something that would give you heart attacks and arrhythmias. And in fact the opposite is true epidemologically speak you can actually you get less heart abnormalities arrhythmias when you drink coffee for reasons we still don't understand.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以八条中的第一点是注意你吃的东西。第二点是吃30种不同的植物。这就是我们**Zoey**产品**Daily 30**的基础，它含有34种主要是冻干的完整植物。我们最近又添加了一些。所以我们添加了一些海藻、一些藻类和一些康普茶。所以它们是稀有成分。我们有七种不同类型的蘑菇，你通常不会吃到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So the first point of the eight was mind being mindful about what you eat. Second was uh eat uh 30 different plants. And that's that was the basis of our our **Zoey** product, the **daily 30**, which has 34 uh mainly freeze-dried whole plants in it. And we've recently added some more. So, we added some seaweed, some algae, and uh some kombucha in there. So, they're rare ingredients. We got seven different types of mushroom that you wouldn't normally have.

</details>

**主持人**: 值得一提的是，我是**Zoey**的投资者。嗯，让我收回那句话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's worth me saying that I'm an investor in **Zoe**. Um, and let me take that back.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以，你只是把它拿出来，通常撒在食物上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So, you just you take this out and you sprinkle it on top of your food typically.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你把它加到食物里。嗯，所以它与你可能看到的大多数其他补充剂不同。嗯，它不是食物的替代品。它看起来比大多数常见的绿色粉末状补充剂更像食物。我们用大约340人进行了一项大型试验，将其与益生菌和安慰剂进行比较，在6周内，你的肠道微生物会得到非常显著的改善。所以你真的会增加有益细菌，并挤走有害细菌，比你只服用传统益生菌的效果好几倍。所以这种肥料方法似乎确实有效，这项研究还表明，几天后情绪也有所改善，这让我感到惊讶，因为我们在计划这项研究时甚至没有考虑到这一点。所以这项研究的关键报告结果是肠道微生物组的改善，**Zoey**肠道微生物组评分平均增加了5分，消化系统方面，70%的人报告整体消化系统症状有所改善。嗯，它使饱腹感增加了41.5%，满意度增加了21.6%，精力增加了43.3%，并减少了饥饿感和进食欲望，与单独进食相比。在大规模研究中，大约一半的人报告精力增加，45%的人报告幸福感提高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. You add it to food. Um, and it's so it's it's different to most of the other sort of supplements you might see. Uh, it's not instead of food. It looks more like food than most uh of the of the common supplements out there that look like green powders. We we did a big trial of this with about 340 people comparing it to a probiotic and a um a dummy one and over 6 weeks you get really quite dramatic improvements in your gut uh microbes with with eating this. So the you really push up the good bugs and squash out the bad bugs about several times more than you would get just by having a traditional probiotic. So this fertilizer approach uh does seem to work and this is this is the study where we also showed the improvements in mood after a few days which um you know surprised me because I wasn't even thinking about that when we we we planned the study. So the key reported findings in that study were a gut microbiome improvement, an average increase of five points in their Zo gut microbiome score, digestive system, 70% of people reported improvements in overall digestive systems symptoms. Um, and it increased fullness by 41.5%. Satisfaction by 21.6% 6% and energy by 43.3% and reduced hunger and desire to eat versus the meal alone. About half reported increased energy and 45% reported improved happiness in the main study.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我们没想到会这样。这才是我的重点，因为我们以为它只会影响肠道，比如“好吧，我上厕所更频繁了吗？它改善了我的肠道微生物了吗？”所以看到这些对大脑的影响真是一个意外的收获。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So we weren't expecting that. That that was my my point really on these because we thought it would just be gut it like okay do I get do I go to the toilet more often? Is it improving my gut microbes? And so it was a real bonus to see these these brain effects.

</details>

**主持人**: 你对那些人做了粪便测试，看看他们胃里的细菌在这段时间内有什么变化吗？是六周吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And did you do stool tests on those people to see yes the change in the bugs in their stomach over that period? Was it six weeks?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 大约六周。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: It was around six weeks. Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。那你看到他们的肠道细菌有什么变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. And what did you see change in their their gut bugs?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我们有一种新的肠道细菌评分方法，我们上个月在**《自然》**杂志上发表了。所以我们过去常常谈论多样性，在以前的播客中，我想我们谈论过多样性，也就是不同物种的数量，但我们现在有更好的方法来看待这个问题，那就是选取100种最重要的、随饮食变化的细菌，每个人都有，因为我们都不同。很难将你的细菌与我的细菌进行比较，因为我们只共享20%。所以这项研究着眼于我们都有的100种常见细菌，50种好的和50种坏的。我们希望在干预中看到的是，与良好饮食和良好健康结果相关的有益细菌正在增加，而与炎症、不良饮食和不良健康结果相关的有害细菌正在减少。这正是我们所看到的。我们看到大约40种微生物发生了变化，使用了益生元**Daily 30**，而益生菌（我们从其他研究中知道它有效）只看到大约四五种细菌发生了变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So we've got a new scoring method for gut bugs which we published last month in in in **nature**. And so we used to talk about diversity and on previous podcasts I think we've talked about diversity which is the number of different species but we've got a better way of looking at that now which is to take um 100 most important bugs that change with diet that everybody's got because we're all different. It's very hard to compare your your bugs with my bugs because we only share 20%. So this looks at 100 common bugs that we've both got, 50 good and 50 bad. And what we want in an intervention is to see the the good bugs are associated with good diet and good health outcomes, good blood tests are going up and the bad bugs associated with inflammation, uh, poor diets and bad health outcomes going down. And that's exactly what we saw. We saw an a change in roughly 40 of these microbes with the prebiotic the **daily 30** whereas with the probiotic which we know works from other studies we saw only a change in about four or five of the bugs.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以它们都有效，但益生元比益生菌效果更好，这在某种程度上改变了我对哪种更强大的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So was it so they both worked but the the prebiotic was working better than the probiotic which has sort of changed my mind about what's more powerful.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么益生元是什么，益生菌是什么？益生元就像肠道微生物的肥料。它在那里。它给它们提供食物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So prebiotic being what and probiotic being what? Prebiotic is like a fertilizer for gut microbes. It's there. It's giving them food.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，以一种不加区别的方式，因为我们提供了各种各样的食物。在这34种植物中，每一种都含有数百种化学物质。所以有成千上万种不同的东西供它们食用。而益生菌，我们使用了**鼠李糖乳杆菌**，这是一种众所周知的细菌，已经在数百项试验中进行了数百次研究。它是一种活的微生物，通常存在于酸奶等食物中，以浓缩形式存在于胶囊中。你服用它，它改善了肠道微生物，但比益生元少得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So that and in an indiscriminate way because we're giving a a wide variety of foods. In these 34 plants, each of them has hundreds of chemicals. So there's thousands of different things for them to feed on. Whereas a probiotic, we used **Lactobacillus ramnosis**, which is a well-known one that's been studied, you know, hundred of time in hundreds of trials. It's a live microbe that lives generally in in foods like yogurt and things like this in a concentrated form in a capsule. You give that and it improved uh the gut microb but much less than the

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以益生元给它们提供食物。益生菌实际上只是把细菌放进去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: so prebiotic gives them food. Probiotic actually just puts bugs in there.

</details>

**主持人**: 它把细菌放进去，我们以前认为它像种子一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It puts bugs in there and we used to think it was like a seed.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，所以它是，你知道，肥料和种子，但我们现在知道那种细菌永远不会真正在你的肠道微生物组中生根。所以科学和我们的想法都改变了。我们认为益生菌实际上是在刺激你的免疫系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Uh so the it was the you know so fertilizers and maybe seeds but we now know that that bug will never really seed in your in your gut microbiome. And so the science is and our thinking has changed. We think the probiotic is is really tickling your immune system as it's going down.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以它可能在小肠的更高处起作用，小肠在肠道的更上方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So it's probably working higher up in the the small intestine which is um further up in the gut.

</details>

**主持人**: 肠道在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Where where is where is the gut?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。所以大多数人，如果你让他们指向肠道，他们总是会想到他们的胃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. So most people if you ask people to point to the gut they always think of their stomach.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，那不是你的胃。你看，那是你的肠道。所以你的胃在这里。如果你拿走你的肝脏。如果你想象我们这里有一个身体，你有一个嘴巴。食物通过食道进入，食道是一根通向胃的管子。这里是胃，它高度酸性。然后通过一个小阀门进入十二指肠。食物在那里开始被捣碎成小球。它进入这里的小肠，这个名字起得不好，因为小肠实际上是肠道最大的一部分。那里有无数的盘绕。有很多隐窝。到处都是小角落和缝隙。所以表面积非常巨大。如果你把它铺开，一个人身上就有好几个网球场那么大。那是因为那里吸收了大部分营养。它们从食物中提取并以这种方式吸收。所以所有微量元素和我们正在回收的东西。我们就像一个回收工厂。然后从小肠，它进入大肠，也称为结肠。那里是大多数肠道微生物所在的地方。所以，99%的肠道微生物都在最后一部分，大肠中，它有几米长，因人而异。这里是纤维进入的地方，那些在肠道早期没有被消化的东西。那是因为微生物主要以纤维为食。所以它们在那里发挥作用。它们将纤维转化为短链脂肪酸等产物，这些产物是对我们的免疫系统非常有益的化学物质。重要的是要意识到，在小肠和大肠中，都有大量的神经。你有一个叫做肠神经系统的东西，它是我们的第二个大脑，实际上是第一个形成的大脑。所以当我们还是小胚胎时，我们开始是一个小管子，围绕着我们肠道形成的神经系统实际上是我们身体的第一个大脑，在某种程度上，我们把第二个大脑放在头上，有点像事后诸葛亮。嗯，这是一种很有趣的思考方式，但它只是表明我们肠道中的神经对我们的功能有多么重要。正如我们之前谈到的，这两个之间存在这种联系，而且还有免疫细胞。我们70%的免疫细胞在肠道中。大部分在大肠中，但小肠中也有。所以我们的免疫系统在这里，我们大量的神经系统也在这里。

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Uh that's not your stomach. You see that's that's your there the intestines. So your your stomach is up here. U take away your your liver. If you imagine we've got a body here, you got a mouth. Food goes in there through the esophagus, which is a tube that leads to the stomach. And this is the stomach here, which is highly acidic. And that leads into the geodenum through a a little valve. And that is where food starts getting mushed around into little balls. It goes into the small intestine here, which is badly named because the small intestine is really the largest bit of the gut. And it's endless coils as of u guts there. Lots of crypts. There's little nooks and crannies everywhere. And so the surface area is really huge. It's it's several tennis courts if you laid it out just one um in one human. And that's because that's where most of the nutrients get absorbed. They get extracted from the food and absorbed that way. So that all the trace elements and things we're recycling. We're like a recycling factory. And then from the small intestine, it then goes into the large intestine, which is also called the colon. And that's where most of the gut microbes are. So, so 99% of the gut microbes are in that final part, the large intestine, which uh is a a couple of meters long and varies widely between people. And this is the spot where fiber uh goes, things that hasn't been digested in the early part of the the gut uh is and that's because the microbes mainly feed off fiber. And so that's where they do the good. They convert that fiber into products such as short- chain fatty acids, which are the really beneficial chemicals that are good for our immune system. And it's important to realize that across both the small and the large intestine, you've got ner huge amounts of nerves. You've got what's called the **interic nervous system**, which is our second brain and is it was actually the first brain to be formed. So when we were little embryos uh we started as a little tube and the nervous system that formed around our intestine was actually the first bit first brain of our body and in a way we developed the second one on our head as a oh bit of an afterthought. Uh which is quite fun way of thinking about it but just shows how important the nerves are in our in our gut to our the way we function. And as we were talking earlier about this this connection between the two and there's also immune cells. So 70% of our immune cells are uh in the gut. Most of them in in the large intestine but also in the small intestine. So our immune system is here and a huge amount of our nervous system is here.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？大概细菌遍布全身吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why? Presumably the the bugs are all through the body.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它们无处不在。所以它们也在你的体内。是的。所以我应该指出，我们全身都布满了细菌。所以人体每个部位都有一些细菌。我们体内细菌第二多的地方是我们的口腔。所以口腔微生物组在我们的唾液、牙齿和牙龈中。这就是为什么如果口腔卫生不佳，如果你不正确使用牙线，患痴呆症的风险也会增加一倍。有趣的是，因为这里的微生物之间存在真正的联系，如果它们正在吞噬牙菌斑和牙龈中留下的其他东西，导致牙龈发炎，就会创造一个环境，让喜欢炎症的有害微生物生存。由于我们不知道的原因，它们似乎会从口腔进入大脑，并在大脑中引发炎症，从而增加患痴呆症的风险。如果你不使用牙线的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: They're everywhere. So they're also in your Yes. So I should point out we're covered in bugs. So every bit of the human body uh has uh some bugs in it. The second biggest place where we have them is in our mouth. So the oral microbiome in our in our saliva and in our teeth and uh our gums. And that's why poor uh hygiene if you're not flossing properly, you double the risk of getting dementia as well. Interestingly, because there's a a real link between microbes here that if they're eating plaque and other stuff that you're leaving around in your gums gets inflamed, that creates an environment where nasty microbes that love inflammation live. And for reasons we don't know, they seem to pass into from from your mouth into your brain and trigger inflammation in the brain, which then uh increase your risk of dementia. if you're not flossing.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，这确实是一项新科学，表明让正确的细菌在正确的位置，避免错误的细菌在错误的位置是多么重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yes, this is really new science showing that just how important these getting the right bugs in the right place and avoiding the ones who are in the wrong place really is.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们为什么需要这些细菌？进化为什么没有设计我们，让我们不需要这些小工人，这些小细菌就能完成所有这些事情？这对我来说非常奇怪，你知道，你认为人体是一个有机体，但实际上它似乎是数百万个有机体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why do we need these bugs? Why didn't evolution design us so that we could just do all this stuff without the need of these little workers, these little bugs in our bodies? It it seems super weird to me that you know you think of the human body as being this one organism but actually it's appears to be many millions and millions and millions of organisms.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，你有一种以人类为中心的世界观。所以，我们是从微生物进化而来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Well, you've got a sort of humanentric view of the world. So um we we evolve from microbes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们曾经是一体的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We are one. We we used to be one.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我们曾经是一体的，而且事实证明，我们身体的大部分都是微生物的残余。微生物显然融合在一起形成了人类细胞。所以这就是多细胞生物如何形成的整个起源。这些单细胞微生物，有些融合在一起做到了这一点，另一些则保持为单细胞。单细胞生物和它们的多细胞祖先之间总是存在这种联系，如果你愿意这样说的话。所以当我们共同进化成更复杂的生物时，两者总是结合在一起。事实证明，当我们形成胚胎时，肠道是设计系统中首先出现的东西，这个圆柱体，这个管子。它的设计是为了含有微生物，这些微生物在训练我们的免疫系统识别有害和有益物质方面起着关键作用。它也被证明对我们的大脑发育至关重要。但当我们开始思考我们的起源，并认为我们本质上始于微生物时，这确实令人着迷，因为我们也不认为我们的身体，你知道，我们历史上总是认为，你知道，上帝的创造，这个身体与任何其他事物无关，我们是宇宙的主宰，我认为意识到我们这么多都来自微生物是相当令人谦卑的。我最近学到了一件让我震惊的事情，那就是我们所有的细胞中都有这些叫做**线粒体**的能量工厂。事实证明，它们不仅仅是为细胞提供电池。它们对抗炎症。它们对基因表达很重要。它们对新陈代谢有益。事实证明，这些东西的起源是困在我们体内的微小微生物。它们本质上是擅长制造能量的微生物。在我们的遥远过去，我们融合了我们多细胞的微生物，它们四处活动。它们说：“哦，我们需要更多的能量。”所以偶然地，它们与这些能量微生物融合，然后慢慢地融入我们的身体，这样我们现在身体里就有了这些**线粒体**，它们的祖先也是微生物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: We used to be one and um it it turns out that most of our body is are remnants of microbes. microbes obviously fused to cause to cause uh human cells. So that was the whole origin of of how multisellular creatures came together. These single-sellled microbes, some of them fused to to do that, others stayed as single cells. There was always this link between the single-sellled guys and their multisellular ancestors, if you like. And so as we co-evolved into more complicated beings, the the two were always together. And it turned out that again as like as we're formed as embryos, the gut is the first thing that you know this this cylind this tube is the first thing that comes out um of the design system. And it's designed to have microbes in it that serve a crucial purpose in training our immune system to recognize what's out what's harmful and what's beneficial. And it's also shown to be crucial for our brain development. But it it is fascinating when we start think about our origins and think of it that you know we essentially start as microbes because also we don't think of our body you know we've always historically thought of you know God's creation this body had nothing to do with anything else we were the masters of the universe and I think it's quite humbling to realize that so much of us comes from microbes and I learned something recently that was that also blew me away is that all ourselves have these powerhouses in them called **mitochondria**. And it turns out they do much more than just supply batteries for the cell. They they fighting inflammation. They're important for gene expression. They're good for metabolism. And it turns out the origin of these things is little microbes that got trapped in our bodies. They are essentially uh microbes that were good at making creating energy. And um at some point in our distant past, we fused um our multisellular um microbes that were were going around doing stuff. They said, "Oh, we could do with some more energy." And so by chance they fused with these energy microbes and slowly and slowly became incorporated into our bodies so that we now have these **mitochondria** all of our bodies which whose ancestors are also uh microbes

</details>

**主持人**: 我们身体的每个细胞中都有它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and we have them in every cell of our body.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，我们有。而且它们在脑部健康中也变得相当关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes, we do. And they're turning out to be quite crucial as well in in brain health.

</details>

**主持人**: 你花了很多时间思考，或者你生命中有过一段时间思考这一切的意义以及为什么会有生命有机体吗？因为生命有机体似乎没有很大的必要。你知道，这些星球上可以只有岩石和水。我不知道为什么人类一定需要存在，就我们对环境的贡献而言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do you do you do you spend much time wondering or have there been periods in your life where you've wondered about the meaning of all of this and why there's living organisms? Because it doesn't appear to be a great need for living organisms. You know, you could just have rocks and water on these planets. I don't know why you need humans necessarily in as it relates to the contribution we make to the um the environment.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，我认为一旦有了生命，无论是植物生命，我的意思是，你可能在思考动物生命，但你知道，像岩石上的**地衣**是生命最早的形式之一，它们需要获取能量和营养。然后它们出于某种原因只是想生存，你知道，我认为这就是生命的意义，就是获取足够的营养，这样你就可以继续生存，或者将你的基因传递给其他人。一旦这个概念开始，也许是**地衣**，其他一切都由此而来，那可能只是一个偶然事件。所以，但我，你知道，想到我们可能从像这样的低级点进化而来，当我们从岩石和水中出现时，总是令人谦卑的。但是，嗯，是的，哲学不是我的强项，但我从发现我们周围的新事实中获得了如此多的乐趣，我认为这很吸引人，我们人类花了这么长时间仰望星空，而对我来说，审视我们内在的微生物及其起源，远比那更令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Well, I think as soon as you had life, whether it was plant life, I mean, you're you're thinking perhaps of animal life, but you know, things like **lyken** on rocks were one of the first forms of life and something that was needed to get, you know, energy, nutrients from the rock and then they for some reason just wanted to survive, you know, and I think that's the the point that life is about getting enough nutrients so you can uh keep living or pass you know your genes on to someone else. It's this uh that concept once that was started maybe it was **lyken** everything else came from that and that could have just been a chance event. So I but I you know it is always humbling humbling to think that you know we've probably come back from some lowly point like this uh as we emerge from emerge from rocks and and water but um uh yeah I philosophy is not my strong suit but I I just get so much pleasure from finding new facts uh that are all around us and I think it's fascinating that we've spent so long as humans looking up at the stars whereas looking inside us at things like microbes and their origin is to me far more exciting

</details>

**主持人**: 也许更具解释性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and maybe explanatory

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 就像，你知道，我们在法国仰望星空。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: as to like you know we're looking at the stars in France.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我们仰望星空，哦，我们从哪里来？你知道，大爆炸是怎么回事，所有这些东西，而实际上研究我们自己内在的东西以及它们从哪里来，我们可以学到更多关于我们自己的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, we look at the stars oh where do we come from? You know where what about the big bang all this kind of stuff whereas actually studying what's in ourselves and where do they come from we could learn a hell of a lot more about ourselves.

### 赞助商信息与生酮饮食

**主持人**: 如果你关注我，你可能听我谈论过招聘，比其他任何事情都多。你可能在我们的另一个YouTube频道**《日记背后》**上看到我谈论我对招聘过程的痴迷。这真的让我想到一个我想给你的建议，那就是如果你在招聘方面遇到困难，请查看我们的赞助商**LinkedIn**。他们的新**AI助手**会根据你为特定职位设定的标准为你筛选申请，只呈现最匹配的候选人。这样，你就不必在一堆不同的简历中大海捞针。它每天会推荐25位符合你要求的候选人，你可以邀请他们申请这个职位。**LinkedIn**是我们寻找团队中长期A级人才的地方。事实上，通过**LinkedIn**招聘的员工比通过其他招聘网络招聘的员工更有可能至少留任一年，可能性高出30%。在linkedin.com/doac免费发布你的职位，第一次就招聘到合适的人。然后使用推广功能访问**LinkedIn Jobs**的新**AI助手**。网址是linkedin.com/doac。条款和条件适用。我所要做的就是倾泻思绪。想象一下，如果你身边总有一个人，可以把你脑海中的想法，用AI合成，让它们听起来更好，语法更正确，并帮你写下来。这正是**Whisper Flow**在我生活中的作用。它是我的思想伙伴，帮助我表达我想说的话。现在这意味着，无论我在路上，独自在办公室，还是外出，我都可以通过说话来回复电子邮件、Slack消息、WhatsApp以及所有设备上的所有信息。我喜欢这个工具。几个月前我开始在我的幕后频道谈论它。然后创始人联系我，说：“我们看到很多人因为你而使用我们的工具。”所以，我们很乐意成为赞助商。我们很乐意你成为公司的投资者。所以，我接受了这两项提议。我现在是**Whisper Flow**公司的投资者和重要合作伙伴。你一定要去看看。**Whisper Flow**比打字快四倍。所以如果你想尝试一下，请访问whisperflow.ai/doac免费开始。你可以在下面的描述中找到**Whisper Flow**的链接。所以这是八条中的第二点，即吃30种植物。嗯，所以**Daily 30**是一种简单又美味的方法。第三点是什么？我会选择吃发酵食品，并尝试每天在饮食中摄入三份发酵食品。

**Host**: If you follow me, you've probably heard me talk about hiring more so than anything else. You've probably seen me on **Behind the Diary**, which is our other YouTube channel, talking about how obsessed I am with the hiring process. And this really brings me to a recommendation I'd love to give you, which is to check out our sponsor, **LinkedIn**, if you're having hiring difficulties. Their new **AI assistant** filters out applications for you based on the criteria you've set for that specific job, surfacing only the best matches. That way, you're not left having to hunt through a mountain of different rums. It'll recommend 25 candidates daily who fit what you're looking for that you can then invite to apply for the role. **LinkedIn** is where we go to find the long-term A players that I have in my team. In fact, employees hired through **LinkedIn** are 30% more likely to stick around for at least a year compared to those hired through other job networks. Hire right the first time by posting your job for free at linkedin.com/doac. Then use the promotion feature to access **LinkedIn Jobs** new **AI assistant**. That's linkedin.com/doac. Terms and conditions apply. All I had to do was brain dump. Imagine if you had someone with you at all times that could take the ideas you have in your head, synthesize them with AI to make them sound better and more grammatically correct and write them down for you. This is exactly what **Whisper Flow** is in my life. It is this thought partner that helps me explain what I want to say. And it now means that on the go, when I'm alone in my office, when I'm out and about, I can respond to emails and Slack messages and WhatsApps and everything across all of my devices just by speaking. I love this tool. And I started talking about this on my behindthescenes channel a couple of months back. And then the founder reached out to me and said, "We're seeing a lot of people come to our tool because of you." So, we'd love to be a sponsor. We'd love you to be an investor in the company. And so, I signed up for both of those offers. And I'm now an investor and a huge partner in a company called **Whisper Flow**. You have to check it out. **Whisper Flow** is four times faster than typing. So if you want to give it a try, head over to whisperflow.ai/doac to get started for free. And you can find that link to **whisper flow** in the description below. So that was the second point of the eight, which is eat 30 plants. And uh so **daily 30** is a is a easy way to do that and a tasty way to do that. What's the third one? I'd go for eat eat fermented foods and try and get three portions of fermentss in your diet

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Every day.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 三年前我不会这么说，因为当时科学证据还不够充分，但三年前**斯坦福大学**的一个团队对28人进行了一项研究，结果显示，他们每天摄入五份发酵食品约一个月，血液炎症水平降低了约25%，这与纤维饮食相比。这让我大吃一惊，因为这是第一项真正好的研究，因为以前有很多研究，但质量不高。突然有人每天进行血液检查，你知道，他们检查了血液中20多种蛋白质，突然你发现食物与直接影响血液炎症之间存在这种联系，正如我们一直在谈论的，这对大脑和身体其他部分有很大的连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: And I wouldn't have said this three years ago because the science wasn't really strong enough to support this, but a study three years ago by a group in **Stanford** of 28 people showed the giving. They gave them five portions a day for about a month and showed that you can get a reduction in blood inflammation levels about 25% in that time compared to a fiber diet. And that, you know, blew me away because this this was the first really good study in this because there have been lots of studies but they're not good quality. Suddenly someone doing daily bloods, you know, they would looked at 20 odd proteins in the blood and suddenly you've got this link between a a food and directly affecting inflammation in the blood, which as we've been talking about has big knock-on effects on the brain and the rest of the body.

</details>

**主持人**: 那就像**泡菜**之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's like kimchi and stuff like that.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 发酵食品是任何通过微生物转化为更好东西的食物，这意味着它味道更好，更复杂，保存时间更长，所以你不需要冰箱。这就是我们祖先这样做的方式。它经过化学转化，通常更有营养。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Fermented food is any food that's been transformed by microbes into something better, which means it it tastes better. It's more complex. It lasts longer, so you don't need a fridge. That's why our ancestors did it. And it it's been chemically transformed and is generally more nutritious.

</details>

**主持人**: 给我举些例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Give me some examples.

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以，嗯，牛奶做的酸奶。你所做的只是添加。

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 零脂肪。零脂肪希腊酸奶。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: No. Uh no,

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 那意味着它会，是的。经过大量加工。你不需要那个。但里面仍然有好的微生物。而且，你知道，你所做的只是将牛奶这样相当普通的食物转化，成年人并不真正需要牛奶。它不是特别有益的牛奶。而仅仅通过添加微生物，你就把它变成了对身体健康的东西。现在这些研究已经证明了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: that that means it be Yeah. heavily processed. You don't want that. But there's still good microbes in it. And um you know, all you're doing is transforming something rather average like milk, which adults don't really need. It's not particularly beneficial milk. And just by adding the microbes to it, you make it something healthy for the for the body. And that's now been shown by uh by these these kind of studies.

</details>

**主持人**: 你说的零脂肪希腊酸奶有什么问题？它说零脂肪。所以听起来像是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Which what do you mean by what's what's wrong with this zero fat Greek yogurt? It says zero fat. So that's sounds like it's

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 没什么。嗯，我们需要脂肪才能生存。所以脂肪是好的。事实上，就在几天前，**美国农业部**改变了他们所有的指导方针，以前是说不要吃脂肪，要吃低脂产品，现在改为说脂肪实际上是好的。我们过去说的所有建议都是错误的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: there's nothing. Well, we we need fats to live. So fat is good. And in fact, the just a few days ago, the **USDA** have changed their all their guidelines, which used to be about saying don't have fat and and have lowfat products to saying actually fat is good. All that advice we said in the past is wrong.

</details>

**主持人**: 那他们为什么还给东西贴上零脂肪的标签？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So why do they label things zero zero fat still?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 因为公众仍然认为它们是健康的，而生产它们的公司通过称之为零脂肪来省钱。他们用淀粉质的人造填充物来代替脂肪。所以它通常含糖量更高，因为它里面是零脂肪。但如果它标明零脂肪，那就是不健康的标志。你应该避免它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Because public still believe they're healthy and the companies that make them save money by calling it by having zero fat. they replace the fat with starchy artificially made um fillers basically. So it's usually more sugary uh by having zero fat in it. But if it says zero fat, it's a sign it's unhealthy. You should avoid it.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么那些发酵食品是什么呢？你刚才说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So what are those fermented foods then? You were going to say you said

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，我应该给你们一个快速清单，这样人们就知道我在说什么了。所以我们有酸奶，我们有奶酪，几乎所有的奶酪都含有活微生物，除了美国奶酪。越是手工制作的，数量越多。嗯，**牛奶克菲尔**，它就像一种超级酸奶，通常含有10到20种微生物。还有**泡菜**。所以我想到4个K。我们已经讲了**克菲尔**。**泡菜**就像**德国酸菜**。所以我们有发酵卷心菜。卷心菜本身很无聊。你发酵它。味道很棒，而且它有这些健康益处。然后是**韩式泡菜**，它是一种辛辣的泡菜，是韩国的主食。它们很健康。即使它含有盐，吃**韩式泡菜**的人血压也比不吃**韩式泡菜**的人低，我喜欢**韩式泡菜**。一开始我讨厌它，但现在我真的上瘾了。然后是**康普茶**。嗯，你在大多数超市和商店都能看到它们。嗯，那是发酵茶，好的**康普茶**可以有30或40种。还有另一种水**克菲尔**，它不那么受欢迎，但我认为我们会看到更多。**Tibikos**是它的另一个名字。它是含有大量微生物的谷物。有点像**牛奶克菲尔**，但添加了水果。然后是**味噌**，你在日本吃到的所有**味噌**。**味噌汤**，嗯，**味噌酱**，**天贝**，所有这些，嗯，世界各地的发酵食品。几乎每个大陆都有数百种不同的发酵食品。在非洲，有各种各样的发酵啤酒和粥。当然，我们有这些活的，但它们也有很多死的发酵食品。显然，面包是一种死的发酵食品。每个人都做**酸面包**。然后是葡萄酒和啤酒。有趣的是，嗯，同样是新科学，死的发酵食品实际上有一些健康益处。所以，我以前非常不屑于，嗯，你在美国商店里看到的那些标有“轻度巴氏杀菌”的**康普茶**产品。我会说，那都是垃圾。没有什么好处。但事实证明，即使是死的微生物，当你进行随机试验时，对宿主也有一些益处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: well I should I just give you a quick list of all them so people know what I'm talking about. So we've got yogurt, we've got cheese, and virtually every cheese has live microbes except American cheeses. The more artisan the bigger the number. Uh **milk keir** which is like a super yogurt often has 10 to 20 types of micro in it. The krauts. So I think of the 4ks. So we got we've done **keier**. The kraut is like a **sauerkraut**. So we got fermented cabbage. Cabbage is pretty boring on its own. You ferment it. The tastes are amazing and it has these health benefits. Then you've got **kimchi**, which is a a spicy uh kraut and the staple diet of Korea. And they're pretty healthy. And even though it's got salt in it, people who have **kimchi** have lower blood pressure than people that don't have **kimchi**, and I love **kimchi**. Now, I hated it at first, but I'm now a real addict. Then you've got **kombuchas**. Um you see those in in most supermarkets and stores. Uh that's fermented tea and the good ones can have 30 or 40 of these. There's other another type **water kefir** which isn't as popular but I think we're going to see more of it. **Tibikos** is the other name for it. It's grains with lots of microbes in it. A bit like **milk keir** but with fruit added. And then you got **miso** all the **misos** you get in Japan. **miso soup**, uh, **miso paste**, **tempes**, all the all these, uh, fermentss around the world. There's hundreds of different fermentss in nearly every continent has their own type of ferment. In Africa, there's all kinds of fermented beers and porrides. And of course, we got the these are the live ones, but they've also got lots of dead ferments. Obviously, bread is a dead ferment. Everybody makes **sourdough**. Then you've got wines and beers. And interestingly, um, again, very new science, dead fermentss actually have some health benefits. So, I used to be very dismissive of uh products like **kombuchas** that you would see in in stores in America that say lightly pasteurized. And I'd say, well, that's a load of rubbish. Be nothing good about that. But it turns out that even dead microbes when you do a randomized trial have some benefit for the host.

</details>

**主持人**: 你看起来有点怀疑。但是这些与安慰剂的对照研究，现在已经足够多了，你肯定相信。我知道一些研究人员，他们感到惊讶，但这是真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You're looking a bit skeptical. But I these against placebo uh studies and enough of them now that you uh definitely believe I know some of the researchers that they they were surprised but it's it's genuine.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 为什么会这样？发生了什么？我们认为，如果你回到我们之前讨论的疫苗话题，看起来尽管它不是活的，但微生物仍然有细胞壁，细胞壁中含有蛋白质。所以它就像你摄入的这些死细胞的碎片。我们认为它们在通过小肠时正在刺激你的免疫细胞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Why is that? What's going on? We think again if you go back to the vaccine um discussion we we were having it looks like although it's not alive the micro still has a cell wall and it has proteins in the cell wall. So it's like the debris of these dead bodies that you're ingesting. We think they're tickling your immune cells as they go through the uh small intestine.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。它正在向你的免疫系统发出信号，让它平静下来，减少炎症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. And it it's it's giving a signal to your immune system to calm down, reduce inflammation.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 这是我们对这种现象最好的理解。所以活微生物是最好的，但看起来死微生物，被称为**后生元**或**僵尸生物**，可能也对你有益。所以，我认为所有发酵食品，即使是我三年前会不屑一顾的那些，可能都对我们有益。这是减少炎症水平的最佳方法。我们在**Zoey**进行了一项大型研究，我们询问了9000名**Zoey**会员，他们没有服用发酵食品，让他们尝试每天服用三种发酵食品，看看他们感觉如何。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: That's our best understanding of what this phenomenon is about. So live microbes are best, but it looks like dead microbes, which are called **postbiotics** or **zombie biotics**, are probably also good for you. So, I think all fermented foods, even those that, you know, I I would have dismissed 3 years ago, are probably good for us. And that's really the best way to reduce your inflammation levels. We did a big study in **Zoey** of we asked 9,000 people who are **Zoey** members who weren't taking fermentss to try and see how they get on taking three fermentss a day. How do they feel?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我想大约有3000人退出了。他们不喜欢，但近6000人继续了，并在为期一周的适应期后进行了两周的服用。大约一半的人注意到情绪、精力有所改善，饥饿感也减轻了。所以，任何还没有尝试过的人，我认为这是一种很好的简单方法，可以看看你通过改变饮食和尝试一些你可能没有想到的发酵食品能改善什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I think about 3,000 dropped out. Didn't didn't fancy it, but nearly 6,000 continued and did the the two weeks taking it after a oneweek run-in period. And around half of them noticed improvements in mood, energy, and had less hunger. So, anyone out there who hasn't tried this, I think it's a great simple way to u see what you can improve just by changing what you're eating and and going for some of these fermentss that you might not have thought about.

</details>

**主持人**: 第四点是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What's number four?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 第四点是调整你的蛋白质摄入。目前，蛋白质在新闻中无处不在。每个人都想摄入更多的蛋白质。关于你是否需要更多蛋白质存在很大的争议。大多数研究表明，我们90%的人摄入了足够的蛋白质。除了很难在饮食中摄入大量蛋白质之外，可能不会造成太大伤害。大多数人在考虑蛋白质时都专注于鸡蛋和肉类。所以我认为人们应该关注的是还有许多其他优质蛋白质来源，如豆类、豆科植物、蘑菇、全谷物，如藜麦和去壳大麦而不是大米。如果你考虑一下，你可以获得蛋白质和纤维，因为我们90%的人缺乏纤维。如果你想照顾好你的肠道微生物，你真的需要给它们提供纤维。否则，你只是通过喝蛋白质饮料来饿死它们。下一个。我们讲到哪一个了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Number four is pivot your protein. At the moment, proteins all in the news. Everyone wants to have more protein. Big controversy about whether you need more. Uh most studies showed 90% of us are getting enough protein. Probably doesn't do too much harm other than it's really hard to get lots of protein in your diet. And most people are focusing on eggs and meat when they think about protein. So what I think people should focus on is there many other sources of good quality protein like beans, like legumes, like mushrooms, uh like whole grains, like quinoa and pole barley instead of rice. That if you're thinking about it, you can get your protein and get your fiber because 90% of us are deficient in fiber. And if you want to look after your gut microbes, you really need to uh be giving them the fiber. Otherwise, you're starving them just by having a a protein drink. Next one. Which one are we on?

</details>

**主持人**: 第五点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Number five.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 第五点是注重质量，而不是卡路里。通过卡路里评估食物的整个想法是错误的。我们过去讨论过这个问题。你永远不应该真正选择低卡路里产品。你应该选择那些是完整食物，具有原始结构，含有所有原始营养素的食物。所以，一切都真正关注未经加工的优质食物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Number five is think quality, not calories. The whole idea of assessing food by calories is wrong. We've discussed this in the past. You should never really go for low calorie products. you should go for ones that are whole foods that are have their initial structure in them that uh have all those original nutrients. So, it's all focusing really on high quality foods that haven't been tampered with. And

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么不看卡路里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: why why not calories?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 因为这不是评估食物的好方法。事实证明，绝大多数人的卡路里限制饮食是无效的。我们知道，特别是通过**GLP-1**药物，当你限制饮食和卡路里时，你的饥饿信号会上升。而饥饿是肥胖的主要驱动因素。所以你所做的只是短期内减掉一些体重。长期来看，它会反弹，因为你的身体会这样做。所以，嗯，卡路里在任何标签上都应该被忽略。你应该寻找支持你肠道的高质量食物。这对许多人来说是一个重要的思维转变。但下一点是关键的一点，它与此相关，那就是避免高风险的加工食品，因为它们会以多种方式损害你的肠道和身体。第一个显而易见的原因是它们含有大量的添加剂和化学物质，以将其转化为可食用的东西。而这些，嗯，像乳化剂、防腐剂、胶质、着色剂、调味剂、人工甜味剂，都是食品公司制造出来欺骗你的身体，让它认为这些东西很美味。它们通常确实很美味，但它们会损害你的肠道微生物，这些微生物在数十亿年的进化中从未遇到过这些产品，因为它们在这种形式下不存在于自然界中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Because it's not a good way to assess food. Uh calorie restricted diets have been shown for the vast majority of people not to work. And we know particularly through **GLP-1** drugs that as you restrict your your diet and calories, your hunger signals go up. And hunger is the main driver of obesity. So all you're doing is losing some weight shortterm. Longterm it will bounce back as your as your body does that. So um calories should be ignored on any labels really. You should be looking to get high quality food that supports your gut. And that's an important change in mindset for many people. But the next point is is is the crucial one which links to that which is avoiding high-risisk processed foods because they damage your your gut and your body in in a number of ways. The first obvious one is that they have lots of additives and chemicals to transform them into something edible. And those ones um things like emulsifiers, preservatives, uh gums, uh colorants, flavorings, artificial sweeteners are all things made by the food companies to trick your body into thinking these are tasty. and they often are, but they will damage your gut microbes who in their billions of years of evolution have never come across these products because they don't exist in nature in that form.

</details>

**主持人**: 就像我手里的麦片棒一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So like the cereal bar I have here.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。所以，这个有，嗯，调味馅料，无论那意味着什么，葡萄糖浆，甘油，嗯，小麦，浓缩果汁，植物纤维，天然调味剂，燕麦片和大豆。嗯，这个看起来还不错。随便吧。不过，我不太确定调味馅料是什么。调味馅料什么都行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. So, this has got um flavored fillings, whatever that means, glucose syrup, glycerin, uh wheat, fruit juice concentrate, vegetable fiber, natural flavorings, oatmeal, and soya. Well, this one doesn't look too bad. Whatever. I'm not quite sure how flavored filling is, though. Flavored filling anything.

</details>

**主持人**: 是玉米片之类的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Was that corn flakes or something?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 玉米片。是的。所以它们是，嗯，我将其视为高度加工的，嗯，可能具有中度风险。在**Zoey**，我们创建了一个新的量表，因为过去我们可能会将所有这些归为一类，但我认为我们现在需要将其视为零、轻度、中度、高风险，具体取决于它们是否含有这些成分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Corn flakes. Yes. So they would be uh something I would regard as uh highly processed and uh probably a moderate risk. At **Zoey** we've created a new scale because in the past we'd have grouped all of these together as the same but I think we now need to think of these as zero mild moderate high risk depending on whether they have them.

</details>

**主持人**: 这个呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What about this?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 那将是高风险。好的。因为这是由，嗯，制造它们的人设计的。它含有防腐剂，所以这个在一周后还会是一样，对吧？我们仍然可以玩它。它不会变质或发霉。嗯，它含有乳化剂来保持其形状。它含有额外的糖。它可能含有大量的盐和糖，还有一些脂肪。嗯，所以它会是超级美味的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: That that would be high risk. Okay. because this is designed by uh the people that make them. It's got preservatives in it that so this will be the same in a week's time, right? We can still be playing with it. It's not going to change or get moldy. Um it's got uh emulsifiers to keep it together. It's got extra sugar in it. It'll have a really amount of salt in there probably and and sugar and got some fat in here. Um, so it'll be hyper palatable. And

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: what does that mean?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 这意味着你可以在饱之前吃很多。所以它会让你吃得过多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: That means that you can eat a lot of it before you get full. So it makes you overeat.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于那些看不到的人，我们说的是白面包。就是你在超市里可能买到的普通白面包。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: For anyone that can't see, we're talking about white bread. Just normal white bread that you'd probably get in the supermarket.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。而且它有特殊的结构，与众不同。这也意味着它几乎不需要咀嚼。好的。所以你把它放进嘴里，你不需要真正咀嚼它。它就像婴儿食品。然而，你知道，用高纤维制成的真正面包，你需要咀嚼好几次才能咽下去。所以，这些食物有很多特点，嗯，提醒你它们是不健康的。所以，不仅是那些对你的肠道微生物有害并扰乱它们的成分，那些添加剂。嗯，你还有它会让你吃得过多的事实。所以，你吃到的很多薯片零食之类的东西，它们在你的嘴里就融化了。它们被设计成你可以吃得很快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah. And it's it's got a special structure that's different. That also means that it it it takes very little chewing. All right. So you put this in your mouth, you don't really have to chew it. It's like baby food. Whereas, you know, a real bread made with high fiber, you you know, it takes several chews to get it down you. So, there's lots of features of these foods that um alert you to them being uh unhealthy. So, not only ingredients which are bad for your gut microbes and disrupt them, the additives. U you've got the fact that it makes you overeat. So, a lot of those potato snacks and things you get, they just dissolve in your mouth. They're designed so you can eat them so fast.

</details>

**主持人**: 有没有好的面包或者更受欢迎的面包？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is there a good bread or a preferable bread?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，有。像**黑麦面包**和**斯佩尔特小麦面包**这样的东西不多，最好是**酸面包**，嗯，德国风格的面包，你知道，斯堪的纳维亚面包，它们对你很好，因为它们仍然保留了完整的全谷物，这意味着它含有营养。也意味着它们更难快速吃掉，而且它们会让你饱腹。如果你吃这种面包，它只会让你更饿。我以前当住院医生的时候总是这样。每个病房都有烤面包机，嗯，**NHS**提供的廉价面包，你吃了它们，它们会给你一点能量，但一个小时后你吃了四片之后，你仍然会感到饥饿。我认为这就是问题所在。很多人没有意识到这种食物不仅让他们生病，让他们的肠道微生物生病，而且它实际上让他们吃得过多。研究表明它会让你吃得过多约25%，你知道，这在你的日常生活中真的会累积起来。很多人，包括我，一生中都认为，因为当他们吃这些东西时，他们会胃痛，有时会胀气，或者会有，我不知道，与排便相关的问题。嗯，他们是无麸质的，就像他们是**麸质不耐受**或其他什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah, there are. There's not many things like **rye breads** and **spelt breads**, ideally **sourdoughs**, um the German style breads that, you know, the Scandinavian breads, they're pretty good for you because they still have the whole grain intact and that means it's got the nutrients. also means it's harder to eat them quickly and they fill you up. These if you eat this bread, it just doesn't makes you hungrier. I used to have this all the time when I was a a junior doctor. Every ward had toasters and uh cheap bread courtesy of the **NHS** and you you eat them, they give you a little kick, but you just feel just as hungry an hour later having eaten, you know, four of them. And I think this is the problem. Many people don't realize that this food is is not only making them sick, making their gut microbes sick, but it it's actually making them overeat. And studies show it makes you overeat by about 25%, which you know really adds up every day of your life. A lot of people, including me, have gone through their life thinking that because when they eat this stuff, they get stomach pains and sometimes they have gas or they'll have like, I don't know, toilet related issues. um that they are gluten free, like they are **gluten intolerant** or whatever.

</details>

**主持人**: 我就是那样的人之一。我以为如果我吃这个，如果我吃这片面包，我会在接下来的两天里都感觉到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I was one of those people. I thought because if I eat this, if I was to eat this piece of bread, I'd feel it for the next two days.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以，我以为我是无麸质的。但是当我们上次谈话时，你告诉我几乎没有人是**麸质不耐受**，或者有**麸质**，那个词是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So, I assumed I was gluten-free. But when I think we spoke last time, you told me that almost nobody is is gluten intolerant to has a gluten what's the term?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, there's Yes.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: **麸质不耐受**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Gluten intolerance.

</details>

**主持人**: **麸质不耐受**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Gluten intolerant.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。但那不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah. But that that's not

</details>

**主持人**: 当你测试他们时。是的。直接。我的意思是，有一些，但大多数认为自己是的人都不是，那是因为通常当你在美国或英国吃三明治时，你吃到的是糟糕的面包，糟糕的馅料，以及各种其他添加剂和化学物质，这些可能让你不舒服。所以当你放弃吃三明治时，你可能会感觉更好。所以大约30%的人认为**麸质**对他们有问题，但只有1%的人需要严格避免它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: when you test them. Yes. Directly. I mean there are some u but most people who think they are are not and that's because generally when you eat a sandwich in the US or the UK uh you're getting crap bread terrible filling uh all kinds of other additives and chemicals which are probably disagreeing with you. So when you give up eating sandwiches you might feel better. So roughly up to 30% of people believe gluten is a problem for them but only 1% actually need to strictly avoid it.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明我们喜欢简单的解决方案。所以**麸质**出现了，说好吧，每个人都可以考虑**麸质**。让我们摆脱它，所有问题都解决了。而不是思考廉价面包三明治中还有哪些其他东西可能让你产生反应。它也可能是将面包粘合在一起的乳化剂，或者你吃的蛋黄酱中的乳化剂。嗯，它可能是这些着色剂中的一些，你知道，使面包变白或使酱汁变成亮黄色，你可能对它们不耐受。这些制造商添加到这些食物中的东西越多，就越有可能有一种东西让你不舒服，你最喜欢的三明治突然，你知道，变成了你最大的敌人，因为，你知道，它们只是由杰出的科学家创造的，他们只关心你觉得它无法抗拒，并继续吃它。如果你吃健康的食物，你就不会有这些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I think it's a great example of we love to have a simple solution. So gluten came in said right everyone can think about gluten. Let's just get rid of that and all our problems are solved. rather than thinking what are all the other things in a in a cheap bread sandwich that you might be reacting to. It also could be the emulsifier that is uh gluing that bread together or is in the mayonnaise that you're having. Uh it could be some of these colorants that are, you know, making the bread white or ch making that sauce bright yellow that you might be intolerant of. The more things that they these manufacturers add to these foods, the more likely there is one that is disagreeing you with you and your favorite sandwich suddenly, you know, becomes your worst enemy because, you know, they're just created by brilliant scientists to all they care about is you find it irresistible and keep eating it. If you eat the healthy stuff, you don't have these problems.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些杏仁呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What about these these almonds?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，里面还有一些核桃。你觉得杏仁怎么样？我喜欢杏仁。嗯，它们对你有益，很多研究表明它们对你的认知有益，甚至对大脑健康的其他方面和情绪也有轻微影响。这些对肠道健康有益。它们含有各种非常好的脂肪。这些**Omega-3**等都在坚果中。所以，它们是一种很棒的零食，嗯，确实能让你饱腹，我通常会推荐它们。我读过的关于核桃对大脑健康的数据可能比杏仁更多。所以，你知道，有一些研究表明，吃很多核桃的人会有帮助，但我认为不应该认为只有一种坚果可以帮助你的大脑。我们应该再次回到多样性的概念。所以混合坚果确实是帮助你大脑健康的最佳方式，通过吃这些东西。我们过去常常妖魔化坚果，因为它们含有脂肪。当然，20年前，哦，你不能吃花生和坚果。它们对你的心脏非常有害。现在我们完全扭转了这种看法。我只是觉得这表明这个领域在相对较短的时间内发生了多大的变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Um, some walnuts in there as well. What do you think of almonds? I love almonds. Um they're they're good for you and lots of studies showing they're good for your cognition, even some mild effects on other aspects of brain health and uh and and mood. These are uh good for gut health. They've got all kinds of really good fats in them. These **omega-3s** and etc. are are in nuts. So, they're a fantastic snack that um do fill you up and generally recommend them. Probably more data about walnuts than almonds for brain health that that I've read about. So, there are, you know, studies of people take a lot of walnuts, they help, but I I think the idea shouldn't be there's only one type of nut that you should eat that's going to help your brain. We should again go back to this concept of diversity. And so mix nuts really are your best way of um helping your your brain health by eating these things. And we used to demonize nuts because they had fat in it. Certainly when I was uh you know 20 years ago, oh you can't have peanuts and nuts. They're really bad for your heart. Now we've totally reversed this. And I just think it it just shows how much has changed in this field in in a in a relatively short time.

</details>

**主持人**: 第七点是什么？所以第六点是避免高风险加工食品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What's number seven? So that number six was avoid high-risk processed foods.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 在选择食物时，重要的是要尽量让你的盘子里有尽可能多的颜色，因为这表明它们含有叫做**多酚**的化学物质。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Important when you're picking food to try and get as many colors on your plate as possible because that's a sign that they contain these chemicals called **polyphenols**.

</details>

**主持人**: 天然色素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Natural colors.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。是的。没错。不是你得到的那些我们真正想避免的蓝色色素，它们对你有害。所以天然色素表明这些食物对你有益。所以，我们说的是鲜艳的浆果，我们说的是覆盆子、黑莓、草莓，我们说的是**罗莎红生菜**，我们说的是紫色的卷心菜。嗯，我们说的是所有那些鲜艳的颜色，因为它们含有属于**多酚**家族的化学物质，这些化学物质可以作为你肠道微生物的燃料。这反过来又使它们能够产生**短链脂肪酸**等物质，并保持它们的健康。所以，这是大自然给我们的信号，表明我们正在吃这些食物，这可能也是你的祖先知道的信号。另一个我们无法通过外观判断，但我们知道的信号是苦味。所以，苦味植物往往比平淡的植物更健康。这就是**西兰花**的故事。这就是为什么**特级初榨橄榄油**对我们如此有益。为什么咖啡也很好。为什么红酒和黑巧克力也很好。正是那些**多酚**在其中，真正地促进了我们的微生物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Not the uh the blue colors you get that we really want to avoid which are bad for you. So natural colors are a sign that they these foods are good for you. So, we're talking bright berries, we're talking raspberries, blackberries, uh, strawberries, we're talking um, **rosolo lettuce**, we're talking about uh, cabbages that are purple. Uh, we're talking really all those bright colors because they contain chemicals that are from this family broadly called the **polyphenols** which act as fuel for your gut microbes. and that allows them to then in turn uh produce things like **short- chain fatty acids** and and keeps them healthy. So, it's a sign from nature that we're eating these these foods and it's a signal probably your ancestors knew. And the other sign which we can't tell from looking at it, but you we get to know is bitterness. So, bitter uh plants tend to be much healthier than uh bland ones. That's the **broccoli** story. That's um why **extra virgin olive oil** is so good for us. Why uh coffee is also good. Why uh red wine and and uh dark chocolate. It's those **polyphenols** in there that are really giving us our microbes a boost.

</details>

**主持人**: 第八点，最后但并非最不重要的一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And the eighth one, last but not least,

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 最后但并非最不重要的一点，让你的肠道休息一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: last but not least, give your gut a rest.

</details>

**主持人**: 禁食。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Fast.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。所以限时进食，这已被证明有助于你的肠道以适当的昼夜节律恢复。这有点像让你的肠道睡个好觉。所以我们都知道睡眠对我们的好处，但我们常常忽视我们的肠道。很多人深夜吃零食，嗯，从酒吧回家时吃烤肉串或其他什么。这对你的肠道健康来说是完全错误的做法。12到14小时的过夜禁食，尝试将你的进食时间限制在10小时内，已被证明对你有代谢优势，并改善你的肠道内壁。所以它不太可能渗漏并引起炎症，并允许清洁团队和你的微生物出来清洁你的肠道。现在有大量的研究表明它确实具有这些代谢优势，但我现在没有那么大力推广它，因为我们确实又进行了一项大规模的公民科学研究，与**Zoey**合作，有超过10万人参与。嗯，我们要求他们进行14小时的限时进食。三分之一的人放弃了。他们说：“我做不到。我总是感到太饿了。我需要吃点零食，比如杏仁。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes. So timerestricted eating, this has been shown to help your uh gut recover in a proper circadian rhythm. It's a bit like getting a good night's sleep for your gut. So we can we all know the benefits of sleep for us, but we often disregard our gut. Many people have a late night snack, uh a kebab going home from the pub or whatever it is. It's completely the wrong thing to do for your gut health. 12 to 14 hour uh overnight fast trying to restrict your eating time to 10 hours really has been shown to have metabolic advantages for you uh and improves your gut lining. So it it's less likely to to leak and cause inflammation and allows the cleaning team and your microbes to come out and and clean up your gut. the number of studies now um showing that it it does have these metabolic advantages, but I'm not pushing it so hard these days because we did do a mass another massive uh citizen science study with **Zoe** with over 100,000 people doing this. Um we asked them to do 14-hour timerestricted eating. A third gave up. They said, "I can't do this. I feel hung too hungry all the time. I need to be snacking something like almonds."

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 三分之一的人喜欢它，两年后他们仍然在做。三分之一的人是那种，是的，我有时会这样做。我觉得这样做感觉更好。所以，我认为这有个人化的因素。但是，嗯，如果你能做到，这真的很重要。我也会敦促那些觉得困难的人，如果你能避免不健康的深夜零食，那会对你的肠道和大脑产生非常大的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: A third loved it and they're still doing it two years later. And a third was sort of, yeah, I'll do this sometimes. I feel better on it. So, I think there's a personalized element to it. But, uh, if you can do it, it is really important. And I would urge even the people that find it tough, if you can avoid that unhealthy late night snack, that can have a really big impact on your gut and your brain.

**Host**: You know, every once in a while you come across a product that has such a huge impact on your life that you'd probably describe it as a gamecher. And I would say for about 35 to 40% of my team, they would currently describe this product that I have in front of me called **Ketone IQ**, which you can get at ketone.com, as a game changer. But the reason I became a coowner of this company and the reason why they they now are a sponsor of this podcast is because one day when I came to work there was a box of this stuff sat on my desk. I had no idea what it was. Lily in my team says that this company have been in touch. So I went upstairs, tried it and quite frankly the rest is history in terms of my focus, my energy levels, how I feel, how I work, how productive I am. Game changer. So if you want to give it a try, visit ketone.com/stephven for 30% off. You'll also get a free gift with your second shipment. And now you can find **Keton IQ** at **Target** stores across the United States where your first shot is completely free of charge. If there's anything we need, it is connection. Especially in the world we're living in today. And that is exactly why we created these **conversation cards** because on this show when I sit here with my guests and have those deep intimate conversations, this remarkable thing happens time and time again. We feel deeply connected to each other. At the end of every episode, the guest I'm interviewing leaves a question for the next guest, and we've turned them into these **conversation cards**. And we've added these twist cards to make your conversations even more interesting. And there are so many more twists along the way with the **conversation cards**. This is the brand new edition. And for the first time ever, I've added to the pack this gold card, which is an exclusive question from me. But I'm only putting the gold cards in the first run of **conversation cards**. So, get yours now before the limited edition gold cards are all gone. Head to the link in the description below.

**主持人**: 近年来你对**生酮饮食**更加开放了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You've become more open to keto in recent years.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我，我会说我对**生酮饮食**很好奇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um, and I'm ke I would say I'm keto curious.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 你对**生酮饮食**好奇。是什么让你对**生酮饮食**好奇？因为我不认为你以前对**生酮饮食**很热衷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: You're keto curious. What's made you keto curious? cuz I don't think you I don't think you were very um keen on keto before for

</details>

**主持人**: 不，我想当我们讨论它时，我当时非常反对它，你知道，但阅读关于大脑、大脑新陈代谢的重要性、大脑能量的重要性，并进行更多的研究，稍微改变了我的想法，因为我们发现它对儿童癫痫有多么惊人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: No, I think when we discussed it, I was I was pretty anti it, you know, but reading about the brain, how important metabolism of the brain, brain energy is and doing more research has slightly changed my mind because what we discovered is how amazing it is for childhood epilepsy.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯哼。它仍然被用作治疗耐药性儿童癫痫的主要方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Mhm. It it is still used as the main treatment for uh drugresistant childhood epilepsy.

</details>

**主持人**: **生酮饮食**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The keto diet.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: **生酮饮食**。所以对于不了解我们在说什么的人来说，你正在将大脑的能量供应从葡萄糖改为**酮体**，这是一种我们从进化角度一直拥有的转换，当我们无法获得食物时。所以在大约两天没有食物后，我们用完了葡萄糖储备。我们从肌肉中用完了它，然后你切换到另一种能量形式。这是一种生存机制，但它往往会重置大脑。所以在癫痫中，他们就是这么认为的。这有点像重启你的电脑。癫痫相当奇怪，因为它以前被认为是精神疾病，就像我说的，因为你可能会出现幻觉、妄想，嗯，它与抑郁症相关，所有这些你会在所有精神疾病中发现的相同症状，有趣的是，它可以通过**生酮饮食**治愈。所以这让我好奇还有什么正在发生。所以理论上，其他一些心理健康问题可以通过**生酮饮食**得到改善。目前，还没有足够的良好证据。有很多轶事，七名患者的研究，开放标签，对我来说不足以说让我们这样做。但我认为绝对值得做一些真正的研究。但也表明，即使你没有达到**生酮饮食**的程度，仅仅通过改善新陈代谢以及大脑如何获取能量，也可能非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: The **keto diet**. So what for people who don't know what what we're talking about here is you're changing the the energy supply of the brain from glucose to **ketone bodies**, which is a switch that we've always had ever in evolutionary terms when we couldn't get food. So after about 2 days of not having food, we've used up our glucose reserves. We used it up from our our muscles and you switch to this other form uh of energy. And it's a survival mechanism, but what it tends to do is reset the brain. And so in epilepsy, that's what they think. It's a bit of a like rebooting your computer. Epilepsy is rather strange because and it used to be thought of as a mental illness as as I said because you can get hallucinations, delusions um it's associated with depression all all the same you can have all the same symptoms you get in all mental illnesses interestingly and it can be cured by the by **keto**. So that made me curious as to what else is going on. So in theory, some of the other mental health issues could be improved by **keto**. At the moment, there isn't sufficient good evidence. There's lots of anecdotal stories, studies of seven patients, open label, not convincing enough for me to say let's do it. But I think definitely worth doing some real studies. but also suggesting that even if you don't go as far as **keto**, just by improving the metabolism and what how the brain is getting its energy could be really important.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为，嗯，关于**生酮饮食**有趣的一点是，作为一个会周期性进出这种饮食的人，我实际上之前给你看过了，我手臂上有一个**酮体**监测器，它一直在监测我的**酮体**水平，并连接到我的手机。嗯，我认为有趣的是，在我们生活的世界里，有很多所谓的“食物噪音”。无论你走到哪里，都有吃不好的东西的诱惑。你走在大街上，有外卖店和垃圾食品店之类的。我认为**生酮饮食**的作用，你可能永远不会在研究中看到，我不知道你是否会，是它有助于抑制食欲。它就像抑制了食物噪音。所以，这就是为什么我认为周期性进出这种饮食对我来说很有用，因为它意味着我一年中有几个时刻，我对垃圾食品的渴望，其中一些就摆在这张桌子上，似乎暂时消失了，即使只是一个星期或两个星期或三周或四周。这让我可以重新调整，重新掌控方向盘。然而，在现代生活中，当你工作非常努力或旅行时，睡眠中断，很容易陷入我们谈论的那个恶性循环，你渴望糖，然后你吃糖，所以你感觉更累，你躺下更多，然后你就不去健身房了，然后你就会陷入同样的下行螺旋。嗯，**生酮饮食**不断地让我摆脱这种可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think um the interesting thing about the **ketogenic diet** um as someone that kind of cycles in and out of it, I actually I showed you earlier I have this **ketone** monitor on my arm which is monitoring my uh **ketone** levels at all times and connected to my phone. Um, I think the interesting thing is in in the world we live in where there's a lot of food noise as they call it. Everywhere you go, there's temptation to eat something bad. You're going down the high street, there's takeaways and junk food stores and stuff like that. What I think **keto** does, which you're probably never going to see in a study, I don't know if you would, is it helps the craving. It like dampens the food noise. So, this is part of why I think cycling in and out of it is quite useful for me because it means I have several moments in the year where my cravings for like this junk food, some of which we have on this table, just appear to vanish for a while, even if it's just for a week or two weeks or 3 weeks or four weeks. And that allows me to kind of reset and kind of take back control of the steering wheel. Whereas it's very easy, especially in modern life when you're working really hard or you're traveling, you've got sleep disruption to get into that exact spiral we talked about where you get like cravings for sugar and then you eat sugar so you feel a bit more tired and you lay down a bit more and then you're not you miss the gym and then you kind of you have the same like downward spiral. Um **keto** continually snaps me out of the probabil the chance of that.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 那能持续多久呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: How long for though?

</details>

**主持人**: 我做过最长的大概是六周或八周。但即使是做，比如说，对我来说，一个星期，那么接下来的四到八周在各个方面都会更健康。所以即使我停止了，我也会更健康，你明白我的意思吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: H probably the longest I've done it is maybe six weeks or eight weeks. But even get even doing it for let's say one week for me will then mean the preceding four 8 weeks are much healthier in every regard. So even when I come off it, I'm much healthier when I you know what I'm saying?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 这就是为什么我感兴趣，因为我认为长期**生酮饮食**永远不会奏效，对吧？它太残酷了，与保持肠道健康不兼容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: That's why what's interested me because I think being on a long-term **keto diet** is never going to work, right? is just too brutal and it's incompatible with keeping your gut happy.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以对我来说，我的意思是，很少有人能忍受它，如你所知，这很艰难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So to me that's I mean very few people can tolerate it anyway as you know it's tough.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。如果我们能想出一种方案，每三到六个月，你进行几天**生酮饮食**，足以重置你的身体和大脑，同时，你保护你的肠道，比如说，通过服用**Daily 30**或其他不会让你脱离**生酮饮食**，但能让你的肠道保持在正确位置的东西，那么我认为我们可能会有一种对大脑健康问题有实际用途的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. If we can come up with a regime that every three or every six months, you had a few days of going into **keto**, just enough to reset your body and your brain, and at the same time, you protected your gut, say by, you know, taking **daily 30** or other things that weren't going to get you out of **keto**, but could keep your your gut in a in a in the right place, then I think we could potentially be have a uh something of practical use for brain health issues.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我很想，你知道，做更多这样的事情。我计划在今年晚些时候的某个时候测试自己，看看我是否能进行一周的**生酮饮食**，同时保持我的肠道微生物快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: And I' I'd love to, you know, do more of that. I'm I'm planning at some point later in this year to do to test myself to see if I can uh do a week of **keto** whilst keeping my gut microbes happy.

</details>

**主持人**: 你做过**生酮饮食**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Have you ever done keto?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，没有真正地做过。不。你知道，如果你为了结肠镜检查而禁食24小时，那么在你做的时候，你差不多就进入了**生酮状态**，但你没有，你还有其他事情要担心，比如上厕所来分散你的注意力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Uh not properly. No. You know, if you've done a 24-hour fast, you for a colonoscopy, you are just about getting into **keto** at the time you're doing it, but you're not you've got other things to worry about going to the toilet to distract you.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为这确实是这样，因为我们谈论了身体的整体图景是多么整体，以及它是多么相互关联，以及大脑与肠道以及所有这些事物是如何紧密相连的，而且**生酮饮食**有一种魔力，它让我感觉重新获得了控制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think this is really it because we talked about how holistic that the whole picture of the body is and how it's so interconnected and how the brain is so connected to the gut and all these things and there's something about doing the **ketogenic diet** which just it feels like I get control back

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 以一种方式，然后对我的生活产生更大的整体影响，我的能力，我生活中的一切，比如我作为播客主持人表达自己的能力。我实际上听到**乔·罗根**也说过同样的话，他说当他处于**酮症状态**时，他表达自己和思考的能力是如此深刻，以至于作为一个做4小时播客的人，他几乎会永远保持这种状态，只是为了那种特定的认知益处，比如思维清晰。我总是对我的团队说，当我进行**生酮饮食**时，我感觉自己像这样看世界，一切都是高清的，我的嘴巴和大脑就像，我总是说我的嘴巴和大脑突然连接起来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: in a in a way that then has this bigger holistic effect on my life my ability everything in my life like my ability to articulate myself as a podcaster I heard actually **Joe Rogan** say the same thing he had him say that words to the effect of the fact that when he's in **ketosis**, it's so profound his ability to articulate himself and think as someone that does 4hour podcasts that he would almost stay in it forever just for that particular cognitive benefit of like mental clarity. And I always say to my team that when I'm in the **keto diet**, I feel like I'm looking at the world like this, like everything's high definition and my mouth and brain are like I always say my mouth and brain are connected suddenly.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我听其他人说过，他们确实获得了这种清晰感，这可能是对长时间过夜禁食益处的一种更夸张的感受，当你14小时不吃东西后进来做这样的播客时。是的，我确实比之前吃了一顿丰盛的英式早餐感觉更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I've had other people say this that they do get this sort of clarity which which could be you know more exaggerated way of feeling that benefit of a long overnight fast um when you come in after 14 hours without eating and you're doing a podcast like this. Yeah, I definitely do feel better than if I'd had a big English breakfast

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 就在之前。但我认为危险在于，你知道，如果人们忽视他们的肠道微生物组并这样做，任何优势都会很快被免疫细胞和身体其他部位发生的问题所抵消。所以如果我们能找到这种间歇性的中间道路，同时你仍然可以照顾好你的肠道，那么我同意那会很棒。但我找不到任何关于这方面的良好数据，除了那些狂热者的轶事，他们显然会说这对他们的病人很好，但没有对照组，因为肯定也有很大的安慰剂效应。嗯，当你努力做这些事情时，很难没有安慰剂效应，就像他们说的，你知道，人们会得**生酮头痛**，他们会得到所有，你知道，当你进入它时，人们说会很艰难，所以你不能进行双盲测试，但我认为这很吸引人，就像逆转**2型糖尿病**会改善你的心理健康一样，如果你改变大脑的能量水平，你也可以做一些事情，这是有道理的。我们不要忘记像**ECT**这样的东西仍然是一种有效的治疗方法。那是一种大脑重置。有时，你知道，我们可能会回到精神病学的旧时代，在那里，你知道，在我们痴迷于神经化学物质之前，我们有一种整体观，我认为这真的很有趣。当你进行大脑扫描时，你发现你的血液中环境**微塑料**的含量处于最高的20%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: just before. But I think the danger is that, you know, if people disregard their gut microbiome and do this, the the any advantage be wiped out so quickly by the the problems of what's happening to your immune cells and everything else in your body. So if we can find this intermittent middle way while you can still look after your gut, then I agree that would be cool. But I couldn't find any good data on on this apart from anecdotes of you know fanatics who will obviously um say it's great for their patients but without any control group because must be a big placebo effect as well. Um it's very you very hard to not have a placebo effect when you're doing that when you're when you're struggling so hard to do things that as they say you know people get **keto headaches** and they get all you know as you go into it people say it's can be quite rough so you can't double blind yourself but I think it is fascinating that in the same way that reversing **type 2 diabetes** you know improves your mental health it makes sense that if you're switching energy levels in the brain you could also do things. And let's not forget things like **ECT** still an effective treatment. That's that's a brain reset. Sometimes, you know, we may end up going back to the the old era of um psychiatry where, you know, before we got into this obsession with neurochemicals to have this holistic view, which I think is is really fascinating. And when you did that brain scan, you found that you're in the highest 20% for levels of environmental **microplastics**

</details>

**主持人**: 在你的血液中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: in your blood.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，那有点吓人。他们将**微塑料**分为两组，根据它们的尺寸。我担心，我是不是吃了很多**微塑料**？所以事实证明，我体内较高的水平实际上是那些通过肺部进入的较小的**微塑料**，这可能意味着在伦敦生活了六十年，嗯，你知道，可能不太利于吸入所有这些灰尘和东西。那有点令人担忧。这可能因为我在过去的30年里经常在伦敦骑自行车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah, that was a bit scary. They divide the **microplastics** into into two groups. The sort of depending the dimensions of them. I was concerned, am I eat was I eating a lot of **microplastics**? So it turned out that the higher levels I had were actually the the smaller ones that you get through your lungs which probably means a life having lived a life in London um you know six decades in London probably wasn't very good for getting all this dust and and and uh things in there. That was a bit of a worry. That's probably because I cycle around London a lot in the last 30 years.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在这方面有什么改变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Have you changed anything in that regard?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我仍然骑自行车。我不喜欢戴口罩。我知道我可能应该戴。我在家里安装了一个新的滤水器，嗯，以去除一些化学物质和至少一些塑料。我仍然不完全相信它们有多糟糕。而且科学，我认为我们还没有真正解决这个问题。但这是我正在密切关注的事情。我认为如果有什么容易做的事情，我尝试避免塑料容器。我尝试避免塑料瓶，我认为这对地球也有好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I still cycle. I don't like wearing a mask. I know I sort of probably should. And I've put a new water filter in my home uh to take out some of these chemicals and and at least some of those plastics. I'm still not totally convinced on how bad they are. And the science, I don't think really we've resolved that issue yet. But it's it's something I'm I'm looking at closely. And I think if there's something easy you can do, I try and avoid plastic containers. I try and avoid plastic bottles and I think that's good for the planet as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 有没有办法把这些**微塑料**从我们体内排出？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is there a way to take these microplastics out of our body once they're in there?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 传闻中他们说像**血浆置换**这样的事情，嗯，你知道，你可以去洛杉矶的温泉水疗中心，取出你的血浆，过滤后再输回你的身体。这是从你的血液中提取的。但是，嗯，我认为没有任何真正的临床试验能让我满意，值得去做，而且它们花费，我认为大约是10,000美元。所以这不是一个便宜的过程。所以拭目以待，但目前是的，这是一个担忧，但我认为环境中可能还有其他更糟糕的东西。你知道，灰尘，农药。有机食品是否比担心塑料更好？嗯，我们不知道这些问题的答案。你对像**Ozempic**和**Wegovy**这样的**GLP-1**药物的看法是如何演变的？这些，嗯，注射剂，我认为现在还有片剂，人们正在服用它们来减肥。它们是好是坏，有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: They anecdotally they say things like **plasma feresis** um you know you can go into a spa in LA and and get your uh plasma taken out and filtered and put back into your body. This is from your blood. But uh I don't think there's any real clinical trials that satisfy me that would be worth and they cost I think they're sort of $10,000 ago. So it's not not a cheap process to have that done. So wait and see but at the moment yeah it's it's it's a worry but I I think there are other things in the environment probably worse. you know, dust, pesticides. Is it better to have organic food rather than worry about plastics? Um, we don't know the answer to these these problems. How is your views on **GLP1s** like a **Zmpeek** and **WGO** or whatever it's called, these these um injections and I think now tablets people are taking for weight loss. How is your views on those evolved? Are they good, bad, and different?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 它们无论如何都将成为我们生活的一部分。所以它们将以我们目前无法想象的方式改变医学和肥胖症，尤其是今年，药片已经上市，并且在许多国家即将专利到期，所以它会便宜得多。我认为对于真正需要它们的人来说，它们是一种不可思议的药物。唯一的问题是你不能真正停药。所以它们几乎是终身服用的。我第一个担心的是很多人在没有监督的情况下服用它们，并且没有被告知要改变饮食。我希望人们服用这些药物，他们的饥饿信号被关闭。然后他们可以注意他们的食物。他们可以做一些事情，比如，你知道，使用**Zoey**应用程序或一些其他教育计划，永远改变他们的饮食习惯，在这个机会之窗中。我认为这才是我们应该做的。而这目前完全被忽视了。几乎没有人同时获得生活方式建议和药物。所以他们失败了。他们又回去了。你知道，体重反弹，他们得到了最糟糕的结果。另一个我们需要关注的小担忧是它们对大脑的长期影响。到目前为止，数据显示它确实降低了患痴呆症的几率，甚至超出了逆转糖尿病的范围。所以，看起来它对大脑有保护作用，可能是因为它可能具有抗炎作用。它减少了赌博和成瘾等行为。所以我们真的不知道它是如何做到这一点的。但如果它带走了你的一些驱动力，那些基本的驱动力，比如我喜欢冒险，你知道，我喜欢吸毒。我喜欢吸烟。我喜欢赌马。它是否在某种程度上长期改变了你作为一个人的身份，比如你作为一个企业家可能会变得不那么优秀？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: They're going to be a part of our life anyway. So they're going to transform medicine and uh obesity in a way we can't imagine at the moment especially now this year that the pills are available and it's coming off patent in many countries so it'd be much cheaper. I think for people who really need them they're an incredible drug. The only problem is you can't really come off them. So they're pretty much for life. My first worry is that a lot of people take them without supervision and they are not told to change their diet. I'd love people to go take the drugs, their hunger signal gets switched off. They can then be mindful about their food. They could do something like, you know, have the **Zoey** app or some other educational program to change their food habits forever in that in that window of opportunity. And that I think is where we should be doing. And that's been completely ignored at the moment. Virtually nobody's getting that lifestyle advice as well as the drug. And so they're failing. They're going back in it. you know, yo-yoing and they're getting the worst of the worlds. The other the other slight worry we need to keep an eye on is the long-term effects on the brain. So far, the data suggests that it does reduce your chances of getting dementia even beyond, you know, reversing diabetes. So, it looks like it's brain protective probably because it might have anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces things like gambling and uh addictions. So we don't really know how it does that. But if it takes away some of your drives, those basic drives to say I like to take risks, you know, I I like to take drugs. I like to smoke. I like to gamble on horses. Is it in some way changing you as a a person long term in that you might be less good as an entrepreneur for example?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 所以我认为这是一个非常有趣的问题，值得关注。但总的来说，我认为从公共卫生的角度来看，这可以长期为医疗系统节省数千亿美元，我们应该更加认真地对待它，并将其整合到整体和教育建议中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: So that is something I think that's really interesting to follow. But in general, I think from a public health perspective, this could save uh you know, health systems hundreds of billions long term and we ought to be taking it much more seriously and integrating it into holistic and educational advice.

</details>

### 脑部健康的其他因素

**主持人**: 至于大脑健康，你也有一个桑拿习惯作为你大脑健康方案的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And as it relates to brain health, you also have a sauna routine as part of your brain health regime.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的，我被一些科学研究打动了，而且我非常享受它，从享乐主义的角度来看。所以我尽量每周洗两次桑拿，如果可以的话，最好之后再进行冷水浴，但科学还不确定这是否会产生很大的影响。这就像是你身体和大脑血管的一次锻炼。所以，嗯，我认为科学是相当令人信服的，是的，它让我感觉很好，嗯，这应该始终是任何人的健康习惯的一部分。做你喜欢做的事情总是很容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah, I've been impressed by some of the science uh coming out of this and the fact that I quite enjoy just actually enjoy it from a hedonistic uh point of view. So I try and have a sauna twice a week if I can if I can do that ideally with a cold plunge afterwards, but the science isn't sure whether that makes a big difference. It's like just a workout for your your blood vessels in your body and your brain. So um I think that the science is quite compelling and yeah it makes me feel good which um is always should be part of anyone's health routine. Something you enjoy doing is always easy

</details>

**主持人**: 经常社交也是你大脑日常活动的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and regular socializing is part of your brain routine.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 是的。如果你看看地球上最幸福长寿的人群，他们都有非常好的社交生活。他们总是和朋友一起吃饭，外出。通常这确实涉及一点酒精，在大多数这些社会中，但这似乎不会对他们产生不利影响。我认为拥有一群核心朋友并定期见面，对你的心理和大脑健康非常有益，而孤独感无疑是对你的大脑健康最糟糕的事情之一。所以，保持你的好朋友关系真的很重要。关于大脑健康或整体健康，我们还没有谈到但应该谈到的最重要的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Yeah. If you look at the happiest longived populations on the planet, they've all got really good social lives. They are always dining with friends, going out. often that does involve a little bit of alcohol in most of these societies, but that doesn't seem to adversely affect them. The idea of having a a a key group of core friends you see regularly, I think, is really good for your mental and brain health, and loneliness has got to be one of the the worst things uh for your brain health. So, really important to maintain your uh your good friends. What is uh what is the most important thing as it relates to brain health or overall health that we haven't talked about that we should have talked about?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我认为我们还没有谈到早期生活经历和压力，还有创伤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I think we haven't talked about early life experiences and stress but trauma.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。所以有一件事，嗯，我们还没有谈到谈话疗法和，嗯，你知道，传统疗法。所以如果你看看所有这些脑部疾病，几乎所有这些疾病，如果你追溯到过去，如果你在早期生活中经历过情感、身体、性创伤，你晚年患脑部疾病的可能性会大得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So one thing um and we haven't talked about talk therapies and um you know conventional treatments. So if you look at all all these brain diseases, virtually all of them, if you go back in time, if you've had uh emotional, physical, sexual trauma in in early life, you're much more likely to have brain diseases later in life.

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 而且这适用于所有这些疾病。再次，提出了它们在某种程度上都是相关的想法。所以，你知道，我们已经摆脱了**弗洛伊德**关于心智与大脑不同的想法。如果你接受这种整体观，这如何适应这种炎症代谢的脑部健康理论？我认为它现在确实适应了，因为他们已经进行了研究，表明在创伤或压力之后，你可以触发你的免疫系统永久性升高。所以再次，你得到了这种持续的压力，恒温器不会降到基线。所以你有一年的时间，一个孩子时期糟糕的时期。他们会在晚年进行测试。他们会发现你血液中的炎症水平比那些拥有美好、温和、安静童年的人要高。我认为这开始将所有这些不同的组成部分联系在一起。这些跨越了所有这些早期生活创伤。你在患有慢性疼痛、慢性背痛、纤维肌痛、肠易激综合征、癫痫、精神分裂症的人身上看到了同样的事情，它影响了一切。但压力的来源在哪里并不重要。它导致了一些生理问题。所以我认为这真的很有趣，这样我们就可以找出那些人，如果我们有更好的压力和炎症测试，我们就可以更早地帮助那些人，在大脑开始挣扎之前，我认为这真的很有趣，当然我们首先要尽力减少问题。他们也对谈话疗法进行了研究。所以显然精神病学被划分为谈话治疗师和药物治疗师，而且有很多证据表明谈话疗法确实可以降低炎症水平并帮助你的免疫系统。所以可能就像和朋友交谈有这种效果一样。所以，嗯，长期与你的治疗师交谈会减轻你的压力，你也可以在血液标记物中看到这一点。整个事情开始汇集在一起，嗯，所有这些不同的治疗方法都可以通过相似的途径起作用，这些途径通过我们的，你知道，我们被**笛卡尔**、**弗洛伊德**分心，将大脑视为与身体其他部分截然不同的东西，看起来如此不同。

**Professor Tim Spectre**: And this is across all of them. Again, coming up with the idea that they're all related in some way. And so, you know, we've moved on from the **Freudian** idea that, you know, the mind is different and from the brain. If you take this holistic idea, how does this fit into this inflammatory metabolic um theory of brain health? I think it it now does because they've done studies showing that uh following trauma or stress, you can trigger your immune system to be permanently raised. So again, you get this uh consistent uh stress that the thermostat doesn't go down to baseline. So you have a period of a year, a terrible period as a kid. They do tests later in life. You'll they'll find your inflammation levels in your blood are raised from people who had a nice gentle quiet childhood. And I think this is starts to link all these different components together. And these cross all these early life traumas. You see the same thing in people with chronic pain, um chronic back pain, fibromyalgia, um irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia, it it everything. But it doesn't really matter where the source of the stress was. It's caused some physiological problem. So I think that that is really interesting so that we could pick up people who if we had better tests of that stress and inflammation we could start to help those people earlier on before the brain started to uh struggle and I think that that's really interesting and of course we want to do most to reduce the problem in the first place. They've also done studies on talk therapies. So obviously psychiatry is compartmentalized into the talk therapists and the and the drug therapists and there's quite a lot of evidence that talk therapy does reduce inflammation levels and help your immune system. So just in the same way possibly that talking to friends has that effect. So uh talking to your therapist long term uh will reduce your stress and you can see that in blood markers as well. the whole thing is starting to come together that uh all these different ways of treating it can be working through similar pathways that looked so different through our you know the fact that we've got so distracted by **Dickart** um **Freud** um treating the brain as something so different to the rest of the body.

### 饮食选择与心理纪律

**主持人**: 我们的播客有一个结束传统，上一位嘉宾会为下一位嘉宾留下一个问题，而不知道他们是为谁留的。给你的问题是，你对什么感到无法抑制的兴奋？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We have a closing tradition on this podcast with the last guest leaves a question for the next not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question for you is, what are you uncontainably excited about?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 我对我们只需做出正确的食物选择就能极大地改善我们的生活和健康这个想法感到无法抑制的兴奋。这真的驱使我如此多地谈论它，做这些研究，做这些科学，传播这个信息，因为，你知道，我们一直在看到戏剧性的效果，我正在谈论我正在做的电视节目，这些家庭真的在受苦。它只是向你展示了如果你开始像对待药物一样对待食物，你能做些什么。你知道，认真对待它，尝试它，并注意到那些差异，嗯，你知道，我一直得到反馈，因为我，因为书籍和媒体，人们告诉我他们的生活是如何被改变的，所以这些反馈让我对这个话题保持兴奋。所以，嗯，我以前的职业生涯中从未有过这种感觉，这超级令人兴奋。嗯，这真的很难，不是吗？我想这就是我们很少谈论的部分，那就是心理部分，你知道，有些人可能会称之为纪律，在我们生活的世界里，你走进，我不知道，一个加油站或一个汽油站，或者你在世界不同地方怎么称呼它，而选择都是高度加工的。嗯，你过着有压力的生活。你整天都在玩手机。你通过连续观看短视频来刺激你的**多巴胺**。你可能，你知道，人们比以往任何时候都更孤独。所以，当我们被神经学和荷尔蒙以及我们的感受所控制时，做出正确的选择往往是说起来容易做起来难。所以，即使在你遇到的那个家庭的案例中，你是否 많이 思考过心理部分，比如在做出正确选择时的纪律？或者你只是认为在这方面知识就是力量？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: I'm uncontainably excited about the idea that we can dramatically improve our lives and our health just by making the right food choices. This is really driving me to talk about it so much to do the studies to do the science to spread the word because you know we're seeing all the time the dramatic effects and I was talking about the TV program was doing with these you know these these families that are really suffering. It just shows you what you can do if you start treating food like you would treat medicine. you know, taking it really seriously and experimenting with it and noticing those those differences and um you know, I get the feedback all the time because I because the books and the media, people telling me how their lives have been transformed and so that feedback keeps me excited on this topic. And so, um I've never had that in my career before and it's super exciting. It's um it's really hard though, isn't it? And this is I guess the part we don't talk about much, which is the psychological part of you know what some might call discipline in a world we live in where you go into like I don't know a gas station or a petrol station or whatever you call it in different parts of the world and the options are very ultrarocessed. Um and you you live a stressful life. You're on your phone all day. You're getting your **dopamine** fried by watching short form videos back to back to back to back to back. you may be, you know, people are lonier than ever before. So, making the right choices when we're controlled by our neurology and our hormones and how we feel is is often easier said than done. So, even in the case of that family that you met, do you think much about the psychology part of like discipline when it comes to making the right choice? And is there any advice there on how to be more disciplined with our food choices? Or do you just think that knowledge is power in this regard?

</details>

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 嗯，知识就是力量，但它不是唯一的东西。你需要技巧。嗯，我们正在与一个食物环境作斗争。你知道，一个价值数十亿美元的行业希望我们吃这些垃圾食品。你的加油站，他们被贿赂，用最糟糕的食物填满你周围的一切。食物越糟糕，他们支付给超市的钱就越多，以便在你会购买的地方摆放。所以，你需要有技巧来对抗这一点。不去超市通常是一种避免这种情况的方法。如果我的房子里堆满了垃圾食品，我可能会吃零食。我发现很难扔掉东西。你知道，你去工作场所，你会看到人们堆满了饼干和**M&M's**。你知道，它们应该被禁止。嗯，所以有些事情你认为我们需要通过稍微改变规则来反击。嗯，就像你不会在办公室里放伏特加酒杯，让人们随意喝一口一样，你也不应该在当前的环境中放糖果和甜食这些东西，你知道，我们正在打一场仗，就像，你知道，他们以前到处都有免费香烟，我们忘了，嗯，他们改变了那个环境，现在香烟很难买到，这让人们更容易戒掉这个习惯。

**Professor Tim Spectre**: Well, knowledge is power, but it's not the only thing. You you need tricks. Um, we're fighting a food environment. You know, multi-billion dollar industry wants us to eat this crap food. your gas station, they're being bribed to fill their everything around you with the worst foods. The worse the food, the more they pay the supermarkets to have it in a point where you're going to buy it. So, you need to have tricks to counteract that. And not going to a supermarket is is often one way to avoid doing that. If my house was filled with crap food, I would probably be snacking in it. I find it really hard to throw stuff away. You know, you you go to workplaces and you see people with piles of biscuits and uh **M&M's** uh there. You know, they should be banned. Um so there are certain things you say we need to fight back by changing the rules a bit. Um just like you wouldn't have, you know, glasses of vodka in an office uh for people just have a swig if they fancy, you shouldn't have candies and sweets and these things. um in the current environment where you know we're fighting a battle like you know they used to have cigarettes that were free everywhere we forget um and they change that environment and the cigarettes are now really hard to get at that makes it easier for people to fight the habit

</details>

**主持人**: 我们常常自责，因为我们认为自己很软弱，认为自己缺乏纪律，因为我们最终选择了错误的东西，但这真的非常非常困难，即使，你知道，我每天都坐在这里，与这些主题的专家交谈。你可能会认为这意味着我做出了完美的决定，因为我可能采访过的人比99.99%的普通人都要多。但我是一个有情感、有荷尔蒙、有生活要处理的人。所以即使是我，嗯，无论我现在对这些东西了解多少，我仍然必须给自己最好的机会，通过积极主动地思考家里的环境，甚至购物车里的东西，甚至办公室里的东西。我必须真正积极主动地思考，建立系统来避免我深夜感到非常非常饿，而我唯一的选择是，例如，嗯，这已经是一个很大的改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and we we often beat ourselves up because we think of ourselves as being weak because of this we think ourselves being like illd disciplined because we end up reaching for the wrong things but it is really really hard and it's really really hard even you know I sit here all day every day speaking to people that are experts on these subjects. And you'd think that would mean that I made perfect decisions because I've probably interviewed, you know, more people than the average 99.99% of the population on this subject. But I'm a human with emotions and hormones and life to deal with. And and so even I have to um regardless of how much I know about this stuff now, I still have to like give myself the best possible chance by thinking proactively about my environment at home and even like in the cart and even at the office. like I have to think really proactively, put systems in place to avoid the possibility that I get really really hungry really really late at night and my only options are for example, you know, um which has been a bit the big change

**蒂姆·斯佩克特教授**: 并且形成习惯，那是另一回事。所以，是的，你有知识，然后你有这些技巧，技巧可以避免最糟糕的罪魁祸首，然后你必须想出这些新的习惯，这些习惯会打破旧的习惯。所以，你知道，与其早上伸手去拿早餐麦片，不如准备好另一种。我们经常发现，如果你能改变一天中的第一餐，它就会变得容易得多，因为那是你主要能控制的一餐，并且能意识到其他风险事件何时发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Professor Tim Spectre**: and it's forming habits and that's the other thing. So it's yeah you got knowledge then you got these tricks tricks to avoid often the the worst offenders and then you've got to come up with these these new habits that you you make that are going to break the old ones. So, you know, rather than reaching for your breakfast cereal in the morning, you've got a different one ready to go. And often we've found that if you can change that first meal of the day, it it becomes a lot easier because that's the one you're mainly in control of and realize when the other risky events are.

**主持人**: **蒂姆**，你写了很多很多书。我会在下面列出所有这些书的链接。这是最新的一本。我知道你正在写一本专门关于大脑的书，我对此非常期待。但这是最新的一本，叫做**《发酵》**。嗯，毫不奇怪，它又一次成为畅销书第一名。嗯，但这里还有一堆书。**《饮食迷思：我们吃什么背后的真实科学》**。嗯，**《喂养：为什么我们被告知的几乎所有关于食物的事情都是错误的》**。还有这本书，非常成功，嗯，**《生命之食食谱》**，里面有**Zoey**创作的100个食谱。我会在下面列出所有这些书的链接，供任何想查看的人。嗯，再次非常感谢你。
