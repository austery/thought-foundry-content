title: 美联储降息预期升温，市场剧烈波动，加密货币遭遇重创
---

### 美联储降息预期推动市场情绪

早上好，各位。欢迎回到新一期的《开盘直击》。我们一切安好，盘前市场呈现绿色，而且只有一个简单的原因。大约20分钟前，市场开始转绿。如你所见，标普500指数目前上涨了约0.56%，这算是一种宽慰。盘前，标普500指数一度跌至649点，而在10月10日我们曾触及647点，所以非常接近10月10日的低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are alive and well, we got a green pre-market and we have a green pre-market for one simple reason. Quite literally we went green about 20 minutes ago as you can see right here. S&P 500 is green right here up about 0.56%. A little bit of a source of relief. We were at 649 at one point in the pre-market on the S&P 500. We got to 647 on October 10th. So very close to those October 10th lows.</p>
</details>

昨天收盘于652点。昨天我们经历了超过一年来最大的一次逆转。我们曾一度上涨2.5%，随后又下跌了1.5%，盘中逆转幅度达到3.5%。但现在我们市场一片大好。至于上涨的原因，坦率地说，我们直接切入正题。稍后我们还会谈到BMR的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ended at 652 yesterday. Yesterday we had one of the largest reversals we've seen in over a year. We were up two and a half percent and then we went down 1.5%. So 3.5% intraday on the reversal. But we are a big green right here. And the reason for the green quite frankly we're just going to get straight into it. And then we got BMR earnings. So we'll talk about that as well.</p>
</details>

昨天我们讨论了那次逆转的原因是什么？英伟达的市值是如何先增加4500亿美元，然后又蒸发4500亿美元的？原因很简单，在一位美联储主席暗示可能希望降息后，股指期货走高。美联储主席威廉姆斯表示，利率有进一步调整的空间，并指出了通胀风险正在缓解。交易员们将12月降息的可能性从37%提升至超过50%。威廉姆斯还表示，通胀率已停滞在2.75%附近，部分原因是贸易政策，但他预计到2027年通胀将回落至2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know yesterday we said what is the reason why we had that reversal? How did Nvidia go up 450 billion then go down 450 billion? Quite literally, the futures went higher after one of the Fed presidents signaled that they might want to get a rate cut. Fed President Williams said there is room for further adjustment to rates and noted easing inflation risks. Traders lifted the odds of a December cut to over 50% up from 37%. Williams also said that inflation has stalled near 2.75% partly due to trade policies, but he expected to move back towards 2% by 2027.</p>
</details>

这真是太疯狂了。我们曾试图为昨天市场的反应寻找各种原因。起初大家都很兴奋，然后又因为市场彻底崩溃而热情尽失。看看现在的降息概率吧，昨天我们还在30%，现在已经到了70%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of crazy, dude. I mean, we were looking for a lot of different reasons for why the markets reacted the way they reacted yesterday. Again, everyone was so excited and then everyone was not excited just because things completely collapsed. I mean, look at the rate cut probabilities right now, guys. Yesterday, we were at 30%. We're at 70% right now.</p>
</details>

我们稍后会更详细地讨论降息的情况，但对于刚加入的朋友们，这正是期货市场反转的原因。现在，我们能否维持这种涨势？我完全不知道。也许能，也许不能。但令人难以置信的是，在威廉姆斯暗示他认为应该降息后，降息的可能性已经超过了50%。我相信威廉姆斯在12月有投票权，这也是市场倾向于认为他可能是促成降息的关键一票的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we'll talk more about what's going on with the rate cut scenario, but but for those just joining that, that is exactly why futures have flipped. And now, will we sustain any of this? I have no idea. I mean, maybe, maybe not. Uh, but this is quite incredible that we are over 50% for a rate cut chance now that Williams signaled that yeah, I think we should cover rates. I believe William has a vote in December, which is why the market's also like leaning towards, hey, maybe Williams is going to be one of the deciding votes that gets us the cut.</p>
</details>

市场如此执着于降息这件事，至少在一定程度上证明了，这可能与人工智能泡沫、GPU折旧或加密货币故障无关。或许，这真的只关乎我们是否会得到降息。我觉得这个解释过于简单，但如果这就是事实，那么它或许能解释我们目前的交易方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the fact that the market is this hung up on just the rate cut, proves, at least to an extent, it proves that maybe it has nothing to do with AI bubble, GPU depreciation, crypto glitches. Maybe it's just literally about if we get a rate cut or not. I feel like that's too simple of an explanation, but if that is the explanation, then, you know, that could be the logic for why we are trading the way we're trading.</p>
</details>

### Bitmine (BMNR) 财报解析

我们稍后会深入探讨降息的情况，但现在让我们直接来看BMR的财报。是的，他们宣布了股息。对于那些在问的人，他们确实宣布了股息。是的，美联储主席柯林斯说了相反的话。所以这也很奇怪，市场因为一位主席说要加息而如此兴奋，但另一位主席却说不要。所以我们得看看市场最终如何解读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we got there. We'll we'll get deeper into what's going on with rate cuts in a second, but BMR earnings, let's get right into it. We do have the report right here. Yes, they have declared a dividend. For those that are asking, they declared a dividend. Yeah, Fed President Collins said the opposite. So, it's also just like, you know, it's weird because the market is so excited that one president said uh to do a rake up, but then the other president said to not. So, we're going to have to see how the market ultimately interprets it.</p>
</details>

2025财年，按照**GAAP**（Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: 通用会计准则）计算的每股收益为13.39美元。他们计划在2026年第一季度开始进行质押（staking）。他们宣布了每股1美分的股息。Tom Lee表示，Bitmine继续在最高水平上执行。公司在2026年处于有利地位，我们期待在2026年初与我们的Maven，即“美国制造”验证者网络一起开始ETH质押。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh fiscal year 2025 gap EPS of $13.39 a share. Uh they are going to start staking in Q1 of 2026. Uh and they declared a dividend of 1 cent of 1 cent. Tom Lee, Bitine continues to execute at the highest level. The company is well positioned in 2026 and we look forward to commencing ETH staking with our Maven or uh made in America validator network in early calendar 2026.</p>
</details>

他们正在为质押业务启动自己的验证者网络。关于ETH价格的持续疲软，Lee先生表示，自10月10日以来，市场流动性和功能下降，加密货币价格持续受挫，那是加密货币历史上最大的单日清算事件。2022年FTX事件后的流动性冲击花了八周时间才得以清除，但与之前的下跌类似，加密货币价格迅速恢复。历史表明，在经历了漫长而持久的下跌后，加密货币价格会呈现V型复苏，我们预计这次当前的下跌也会是同样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so they're launching their own validator network for staking on the continued weakness in ETH prices states Mr. Lee. Crypto prices continue to suffer as the drop in market liquidity and function since October 10th which was the largest ever single day liquidation event in the history of crypto in 2022. The post FTX liquidity shock took eight weeks to clear, but similar to prior draw downs, crypto prices quickly recovered. History shows crypto prices stages V-shaped recoveries after a lingering and drawn out decline, and we expect this to be the case in this current draw down.</p>
</details>

他们的净收入为3.28亿美元。他们宣布每股1美分的股息。他们是第一家宣布股息的大型加密货币公司，并将在2026年1月于拉斯维加斯的Wynn酒店举行年度股东大会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh they had net income of 328 million. They're declaring a dividend of 1 cent a share. Uh they're the first large cap crypto company to declare a dividend and they will have their annual shareholder meeting in Las Vegas at the win January 2026.</p>
</details>

Maven，这个“美国制造”的验证者网络，将具备安全可靠的运营、性能和奖励收益生成能力、运行专用基础设施的能力，以及全面的服务质量和支持。他们计划在2026年第一季度上线。Tom Lee说：“我们计划与一个或多个试点合作伙伴，以及世界级的基础设施提供商合作，在未来几个季度扩大我们的‘美国制造’验证者网络。尽管市面上有很多现成的解决方案，但我们相信要为我们原生质押的以太坊打造顶级的目的地，并为能与最优秀的合作伙伴共同建设而感到自豪。从长远来看，我们相信我们的战略将最符合股东的长期最佳利益。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Maven, the made in America validator network, is going to have safe and secure operations, performance and reward yield generation, ability to run dedicated infrastructure, overall service quality and support, and they plans to go live in the calendar year or the first quarter of 2026. Tom Lee says, "We plan to partner with one or more of these pilot partners, plus worldclass infrastructure providers to scale our made in America validator network over the coming quarter. Although many off-the-shelf offerings exist, we believe in building the premier destination for our natively stake ether and are proud to build with the best partners. At scale, we believe our strategy will best serve the long-term best interests of our shareholders.</p>
</details>

这就是目前的情况。我没有关于流通股数量的信息。也许这会在另一份新闻稿中披露，但我也在网上看他们的演示文稿，没有看到流通股数量，所以我不确定我们是否有这个信息。它并不容易找到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and that's what you got. That is what you got. I have nothing on the amount of shares outstanding. Uh maybe that'll be disclosed in a different um piece of news, but I'm looking at their their presentation online as well, and I don't see outstanding shares, so I don't know if we have that information. Um I mean, it's not like easily available to see.</p>
</details>

坦白说，这个股息有点奇怪。我不知道每股1美分有什么意义。我宁愿他们用那笔钱去买更多的以太坊。所以，我不知道每股1美分到底有什么作用，但我猜这是他们吸引股东留下或激励新股东加入的策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dividend is kind of weird. I'm not going to lie. I don't know what's the point of 1 cent a share. I I kind of would rather them use that and buy more Ethereum. So, I I don't know what the one cent a share really does, but I don't know. I I guess that's their strategy of enticing shareholders to stay or to incentivize shareholders to to to come in,</p>
</details>

我没有股份数据。如果有人有，请告诉我。也许**10-Q**（10-Q Report: 美国上市公司按季度向证券交易委员会提交的财务报告）还没出来，但应该很快就会发布。我在他们的网站上没看到，早上也试着找了，除了我现在正在滚动的这个PowerPoint演示文稿，没有看到任何其他的SEC文件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I don't have the share. If anyone has it, let me know. Um maybe the 10 Q is not out yet, but it should be out like relatively soon. I I I don't see it on their website, but I tried looking in the morning. I didn't see any of the other SEC filings outside of this like PowerPoint presentation that I'm scrolling through right now.</p>
</details>

所以，他们有股息，也宣布了开始质押的计划。至少我们现在知道他们为什么现在不进行质押了。他们正在建立自己的验证者网络来进行质押。所以，对于任何问他们为什么不质押的人来说，原因是我猜他们将在2026年初以自己的专有方式进行。他们还实现了约3.3亿美元的净收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have a dividend, you have a declaration to start ST, at least we know why they're not staking now. They're building their own validator network to stake. So, for anyone asking why they're not staking, it's because I guess they're doing it in their own proprietary way in 2026 in the beginning. and they made about $330 million of net income.</p>
</details>

有人说有2.84亿股。问题是券商们自己也搞不清楚。比如Robinhood一个说法，Webull又一个说法。所以你不能真的用券商的数据来确定其准确性。他们真的需要在10-Q文件中向我们展示。我相信我们很快就能得到这些信息，可能就是今天。但我们最终还是要看它什么时候出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To us 284 million shares. Yeah. The problem is the brokerages have no idea. Like Robin says something, Weeble says something. So, you can't really use the brokerages to kind of define the accuracy of it. We They really just need to show us on the 10Q. And so, I believe we should get the information soon, like today. But we're going to have to see ultimately when that comes out.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币市场遭遇血洗

这就是BMR财报的情况。对于那些昨晚没睡的人来说，这并没有真正推动股价，因为加密货币市场经历了一场血洗。绝对是一场血洗，各位。比特币一度跌至80,500美元，那是在凌晨2点左右。以太坊跌至2620美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so there you go. That's what you got on BMR earnings. Not really moving the stock for for those that I mean were awake at least at all last night at crypto just went through a blood bath. I mean absolute blood bath, guys. Crypto got to Bitcoin got to 80,500 at one point. This was at like 2 a.m. Ethereum got to 2620.</p>
</details>

这真是令人难以置信。我们在加密货币市场上看到了明显的去杠杆化和令人作呕的撤资。我相信它们之所以能有所反弹，唯一的原因是基于一位美联储主席表示降息可能性更大，从而推高了期货的概率。Bitmine目前上涨1.64%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean I this is I I don't know. This is quite incredible right here. I mean, we have an obvious deleveraging and disgusting sort of withdrawal on the crypto markets. The only reason they're getting a rebound, I believe, is because of these future probabilities going higher based on one Fed president saying that futures uh or that that the rate cut is more likely than not. Bit mine right there is up 1.64%.</p>
</details>

但以太坊和比特币仍在遭受重创，只是反弹了一些。标普500指数上涨约0.55%。Robinhood上涨1.7%，Meta和Nvidia也略有上涨。今天将会是非常有趣的一天。我会在聊天中发起涨跌投票。在标普500指数过去一周下跌了大约6%到7%之后，我们是否会看到哪怕是同情性的反弹？还是会彻底崩盘？昨天感觉就像是崩盘了，真的，因为根本看不到底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Ethereum and Bitcoin still getting hit, getting a bit more of a rebound. S&P 500 up about 0.55%. Robin Hood's up 1.7. Meta's up a little bit. Nvidia's up a little bit. Today is going to be a really interesting day. I'll put the green or red poll in the chat. I mean, do we think we get even a sympathy rebound after a basically six to 7% decline we saw in the S&P 500 today or over the past week? Or does the bottom fall out? And it felt like the bottom fell out yesterday. I mean, it really did because, you know, there was just no bottom in sight.</p>
</details>

但在一个期权到期的周五，你是否能看到任何程度的反弹？我不知道，真的不知道。但我们今天就会找到答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um on a Friday where options are expiring, do you get any level of rebound? I don't know. I really don't know. But we're going to find out here today.</p>
</details>

有人说幻灯片显示流通股为2.34亿股。是吗？我在幻灯片上没看到。哦等等，我想我看到了。不，但这说不通。好吧，我得更深入地研究这些资料才能得到确切的数字。我敢肯定我们今天会得到它。我们只需要仔细看看这些数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You said the slide deck says 234 million shares outstanding. Does it? Um I don't see it on the slide deck. Oh wait, hold on. I think I do. No, but that makes no sense. Okay, I'm gonna have to go through this stuff a little bit more in depth to get the exact number. I'm sure we'll get it today. I I'm I'm pretty sure we'll get it today. We're just going to need to look through some of these numbers.</p>
</details>

当我们拿到数据后，就能更好地计算MNAB，特别是因为我们也有每股收益。但无论如何，股息对我来说是最令人困惑的。我不确定他们为什么要派发股息。这对我来说是令人困惑的部分。我不知道这股息是否足够吸引人留下，但不管怎样，你确实有这个股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, when we get it, we'll be able to have a better calculation of the MNAB, especially because we have the EPS as well. But regardless, the dividend is the most confusing to me. I'm not sure why they're giving a dividend. That is like that's the confusing part to me. I I don't know if the dividend is going to be attractive enough to get people to stay, but nonetheless, you do have that dividend.</p>
</details>

### 市场动荡背后的多重因素：日元套利交易与系统性去杠杆

这就是我们关于BMR财报的全部内容，我想这也是我们今天早上唯一的真实财报。至于恐惧与贪婪指数，我们现在是8，各位。昨天我们达到了6。所以，这显然非常接近解放日。解放日的低点我们曾到过3。所以，我猜我们离绝对低点就那么近了。但在这里买入的问题是，一切都像是在接坠落的刀子。所以，也许恐惧与贪婪指数真的要回到解放日的低点，我们才能触底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we have on BMR earnings, and I think that's the only real earnings that we have this morning. Fear and greed index, we are at eighth, guys. We got to six yesterday on fear and greed. So, it's obviously been very close to the liberation. Liberation lows, we got to three. So, I mean, I don't know. I guess we uh I guess we're just that close to to getting to the absolute lows. But uh the problem with buying here is that everything has been a falling knife.</p>
</details>

我们一直处于接飞刀的境地。每一次下跌都是一次艰难的买入时机。所以现在的问题就变成了，我们何时才能触底，以及这一切将如何收场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean maybe Fear and Greed literally has to get back to those liberation day lows for us to bottom. But we have been in falling knife territory. Every dip has been a tough dip to buy. So now the question is just going to be when we do end up bottom and how this fully plays out.</p>
</details>

是的，Karp和Shaman昨天都卖了股票。那些都是预先安排好的销售，即 **10 B5-1** 计划（Rule 10b5-1: 允许公司内部人员在不掌握重大非公开信息时，预先设立一个在未来某个时间出售公司股票的交易计划）。所以不管昨天的股价是多少，你都会看到内部人士在抛售股票，因为他们的预定销售就是这样运作的。另外，如果你关注Palantir过去几年的情况，就会发现11月是他们通常在感恩节前出售股票的时候。所以他们在过去几年都在这个时候卖出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, Karp Schult sold shares yesterday. Shaman sold shares yesterday. That those were all scheduled sales. 10 B51s. So regardless of what the share price was yesterday, you were going to have insider selling a pound share and because that's how kind of their scheduled sales work. Also, November is I mean if you've just you know been around Pounder for the past couple years, November is when they tend to sell around this time going into Thanksgiving. So they sold for the past couple years of this time.</p>
</details>

我不认为Palantir的股价下跌是因为内部人士昨天卖了几十万股。昨天发生的事情，是我们在整体股市中看到了基本面的重新评级。我们会谈到一些原因，但我认为这并非因为散户决定恐慌性抛售，也不是因为内部人士决定卖出。我真的认为，这是因为市场基本上认定，如果我们得不到降息，我们就会走低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think Pounder got hit because insiders sold a couple hundred thousand shares yesterday. I mean, what happened yesterday was one of those days where fundamentally we saw a rerating in the overall equity markets. Um, and we'll talk about some of the reasons for why, but I I don't think it was because retail decided to panic sell or insiders decided to sell. I really think it was because the market basically decided if we're not getting a rate cut, we're going lower.</p>
</details>

在上午11点，经历了一个明媚的绿色早晨之后，有两位美联储主席出来说：“我们认为我们不需要降息。”在我看来，这让市场从认为“哦，美联储不会站在我们这边”的想法，转变为“我们为什么要和美联储作对？我们需要在美联储准备好给我们更多流动性之前，撤出风险资产。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at 11:00 a.m. after having a bright green morning and you had two Fed presidents come out and say, "We don't think we need to have a rate cut." It just kind of flipped, in my opinion, the market from thinking, "Oh, the Fed's not going to be on our side. Why are we trying to fight the Fed? We need to get out of risk on assets until the Fed is ready to give us more liquidity."</p>
</details>

不幸的是，这似乎就是正在发生的情况，经历起来相当难看。但无论如何，这就是现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And unfortunately, that seems to be how this is playing out, which is, you know, pretty ugly to live through. But nonetheless, this is what's happening.</p>
</details>

昨天发生的另一件事是关于**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 借入低利率的日元，投资于高收益的外国资产以赚取利差的策略）的想法，我一直在深入研究。今天早上，日本正式公布了一项相当规模的刺激计划，规模将是某些人预期的两倍。他们将投入约21.3万亿日元。该计划包括11.7万亿日元的物价救济，如汽油和电力补贴，以及每个孩子2万日元的现金发放。说到日本印钞，他们是真在印。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, now the other thing that happened yesterday is also the idea of this Japanese yen carry trade that I've been looking more deep into. So, Japan officially unveiled a decent level of stimulus this morning. It's going to be double what some people thought it was going to be. It's going to be around um 21.3 trillion yen that they're going to be putting out. The plan includes 11.7 trillion in price relief like gas and electricity subsidies and 20,000 per child cash handout. I mean, you talk about Japan printing. They are printing.</p>
</details>

政府表示，这些措施可能在明年初将整体通胀率拉低约0.7个百分点，并在三年内每年将GDP提升约1.4个百分点。该方案还增加了国防和危机管理支出，使新发行的债券总额接近去年的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government says the measures could pull down headline inflation by around 0.7 percentage point early next year and lift GDP by roughly 1.4 percentage points per year for three years. The package also boosts defense and crisis management spending, taking total new bond issuance close to last year's levels.</p>
</details>

日本刺激计划的问题在于，鉴于他们正在印制所有这些钱，市场担心债券收益率，因为如果人们认为通货膨胀率会上升，或者他们认为政府正在使货币贬值，那么债券的吸引力就会大大降低，这会导致人们抛售债券，从而推高收益率。所以，如果你之前做空日元来购买美国资产，而现在日元在这次刺激计划公布后大幅升值，那么你可能就不得不卖掉你的美国资产来弥补日元的空头头寸。这就是日元套利交易的基本原理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem with the Japanese stimulus is that given they're printing all this money, the market is afraid uh of obviously bond yields because the bonds become a lot less enticing which means people sell off the bonds causing the yields to rise if people believe the rate of inflation is going to go higher or they believe that the government is debasing the currency. So, if you were borrowing yen short to be able to uh buy US assets and now the yen is going higher, which the yen has gone much higher over the past couple of days after this um this stimulus has been unveiled, then you might have to sell your US assets to cover your short on the yen. And then that is the sort of basics of the year, the yen carry trade.</p>
</details>

真正有趣的是，我认为比特币可能是整个生态系统如何运作的关键环节之一，或者说比特币是如何与日元挂钩的。因此，感觉很明显，许多日本市场都在利用比特币作为对冲其空头头寸的一种抵押品或杠杆，或者你也可以说，即使不在日本的对冲基金也在做同样的事情。这就是为什么比特币首当其冲，或者至少感觉是这样。也许事实并非如此，但无论如何，这可能是一个论据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's really interesting about this is I think Bitcoin could be one of the lynch pins of how this entire ecosystem is playing out or how Bitcoin is kind of pegged to the yen. And as a result, I mean, like it's it it feels kind of obvious that a lot of the Japanese markets were using Bitcoin as a form of either collateral or leverage in the face of their short or you could just say hedge funds were doing the same as well, even if they are not in Japan. And that's why Bitcoin was the first to suffer or at least it feels like that's why the Bitcoin was the first to suffer. Maybe that's not true, but nonetheless, that's that that could be an argument.</p>
</details>

要么是这个解释，要么是Tom Lee关于系统故障的解释，即加密货币系统存在故障，这就是为什么加密货币的情况如此糟糕，也是为什么我们经历了那些最古老的去杠杆化。或者你可以说，这是因为缺乏制动机制，但无论如何，其中一个原因导致了我们看到的一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it's either that explanation or Tom Lee's glitch explanation that crypto has a glitch in the system and that's why things have been so bad for crypto and that's why we've had those oldest deleveraging. Or you could say it's, you know, the lack of breaks, but one or the other has been kind of why we've seen some pain.</p>

### 美联储官员激辩：鸽派与鹰派的交锋

莫兰是我们的鸽派人物。让我们看看他是否会反驳他其他同事关于降息的说法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">be very important to hear. Yeah, here we go. All right. So, we got Moran. Moran is our dove. Let's see if he's going to kind of combat what some of his other colleagues have been saying about cuts</p>
</details>

超额通胀是一种幻象，它并不代表供需失衡。举个例子，看看房地产市场，市场租金已经连续几年以大约1%的速度运行。而指数中测得的通胀实际上远高于此，因为指数需要很长时间才能收敛到市场租金的水平。这是一个统计上的假象，是统计测量过程的产物。它反映的是2022年、2023年存在的供需失衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">excess is a mirage. It's not indicative of supply demand imbalances. And so, for example, if you look at the housing market, right, market rents have been running at about 1% for a couple years. Measured inflation in the index is actually much higher than that because it takes a really long time for the index to converge down to where market rents are. That's a statistical artifact, right? That's an artifact of the statistical measurement process. It's indicative of a supply demand imbalance that was there in 2022 2023.</p>
</details>

货币政策的作用有滞后性，必须现在就为2027年设定。所以当你看到住房数据时，市场租金连续几年以大约1%的速度运行，那里没有供需失衡。我们不应该基于2022年或2023年存在的供需失衡来为2027年设定政策，那没有任何意义。还有其他一些事情，比如投资组合管理服务，它们混淆了数量和价格。这些都是众所周知的。如果你看基于市场的通胀指标，它们更接近2%，而不是3%。所以我认为超额部分是海市蜃楼，要求人们因为统计测量过程的怪癖而失业是错误的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Monetary policy works with lags. It has to be set now for 2027. So when you look at the housing data, right, you see market rents running about 1% for a couple years, there's no supply demand imbalance there. We should not be setting policy for 2027 based on a supply demand imbalance that existed in 2022 or 2023. That doesn't make any sense. There's other things too like portfolio management services which confuse quantities for prices. This stuff is all well known. If you look at market-based measures of inflation, they're much closer to to two than they are to three. So I think that the excess, the overage is a mirage and it's a mistake to ask people to lose their jobs because of quirks of the statistical measurement process.</p>
</details>

正如我刚才所说，货币政策的作用有滞后性。如果它能立即对经济产生影响会容易得多，但事实并非如此。它有滞后性。所以你必须根据预测来制定政策。数据之所以重要，是因为它们会影响你的预测。为3到6个月前的经济状况制定政策是没有意义的。我们应该为未来12到18个月的经济状况制定政策。所以如果我们有数据，它能让我们更新预测。但缺乏数据并不意味着我们没有预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, as I said a moment ago, monetary policy works with lags. It would be much easier if it hit the economy immediately, but it doesn't. It works with lags. So, you have to set policy based on the forecast. So, the data matter in so far as they affect your forecast. It doesn't make sense to be setting policy for where the economy was 3 or 6 months ago. We we should be setting policy based for where the economy is going to be 12 to 18 months from now.</p>
</details>

我们确实有预测。数据只是给了我们证伪预测的机会。而在数据、新闻、媒体报道、私营部门数据以及我们可用的替代数据中，没有任何东西能让我们认为预测被以某种方式推翻了，或者发生了巨大的冲击。所以，如果说有什么的话，自9月联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议以来我们得到的所有信息都倾向于另一边。我们得到的通胀比人们预期的要弱，失业率也比人们预期的要高。所以所有这些信息都应该把人推向鸽派的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if we have data, it gives us the ability to update our forecast. But the lack of data doesn't mean that we don't have a forecast. We did have a forecast. And all it gives us is opportunities to falsify our forecast. And there hasn't been anything in the data, in the news, in media stories, in private sector data, alternative data that's available to us that would make us think that the forecast is somehow nullified and and there's been a big shock to it. So if anything, all the information that we've gotten the interim since since the since September FOMC has inclined to the other side. you know, we got weaker uh inflation than people expected and we got uh a higher unemployment rate than than folks were expecting. So, all of that information should push one in the dovish direction.</p>
</details>

再次强调，莫兰是鸽派，今天美联储主席威廉姆斯也发表了鸽派言论。如你所见，这里的概率是71%。我甚至觉得这不太合理。我不明白为什么在昨天有三位美联储主席说我们不需要降息，今天早上又有一位说我们不需要降息的情况下，仅仅一位主席站出来说我们需要降息，就能把概率推高到71%。我很高兴，因为这给了我们一些喘息的机会。但各位，期货现在之所以是绿色的，唯一的原因就是降息概率的U型反转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, Moran is a dove and also Fed President Williams came out today and was dovish. As you can see, the probabilities right here, 71 per one. This doesn't really even make sense to me. I don't know how one Fed president coming out saying that we need a cut when three of them yesterday said we didn't need a cut and another one this morning said we didn't need a cut pushes the probabilities to 71%. I mean, I'm happy because that's giving us a little bit of relief. But the only reason futures are green right now, folks, is because you have this rate cut probability U-turn.</p>
</details>

我认为昨天上午11点的逆转比单纯的降息故事更具系统性。我愿意相信这背后有更深层的原因。但如果这真的只是降息的故事，那么就有机会稳定下来，也许我们不会跌到7000点，但如果我们得到降息，也许也不必再跌回6000点，那么降息对市场将是有利的。问题是，我们能得到降息吗？但如果这就是转向的原因，那么市场显然非常在乎这次降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think yesterday's reversal at 11 a.m. was more systemic than just a rate cut story. I I I want to believe it was more than that. But if it was just the rate cut story and you know there's a chance to stabilize and maybe we don't go to 7,000 but we also maybe don't have to dump back to 6,000 if we get the rate cut then it would behoove the markets to get a rate cut. The question is are we going to get it? But if that's the reason for the pivot then uh the market obviously really cares about getting this rate cut.</p>
</details>

最终这归结于数据依赖性的问题，即当你没有预测，或者对你的预测没有任何信心时，你该怎么做。我们应该依赖预测，而不是依赖数据。过度依赖数据就是过于向后看。如果你过于向后看，你必然会制定出错误的政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this ultimately comes down to the question of data dependence is what you do when you don't have a forecast or when you don't have any confidence in your forecast. Right? We should be forecast dependent, not data dependent. Being excessively data dependent is to be too backward-looking. And if you're too backward-looking, you necessarily are going to have the wrong policies.</p>
</details>

是的，绝对不会。如果我的投票是决定性的，我绝对会投票支持降息25个基点。毫无疑问。否则就是为了虚荣而对经济造成真正的伤害，而我不是那样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, ABS, absolutely not. Uh, I would absolutely vote for for a 25 basis point cut if my vote were the marginal vote. Uh, there's there's no there's no question about that. I I you know to to to to do otherwise would be to cause real harm uh to to the economy uh for for purposes of vanity and and that's not who I am</p>
</details>

我知道我们有时会批评莫兰，因为他非常啰嗦，但你看他刚才回答问题的方式，与昨天那位“吊床女士”相比，当她被具体问到她对就业和通胀的看法时，她就是无法回答问题，你知道，试图保持中立。而他只是说，不，我会投赞成票。他只是告诉美国人民他会怎么做，对此我深表赞赏，因为每个人都应该知道美联储将如何投票，以及他们将如何管理货币政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I know sometimes we criticize Moran because he's very verbose but you see how we just answered the question compared to the to the hammock lady yesterday when she was asked specifically and she just could not answer the question of how she's thinking of jobs and inflation yada she like you know trying to stay middle of the road he's just like no I'm going to vote yes like he's just telling the American people what he's going to do and that I deeply appreciate because everyone deserves to know how the Fed is going to vote and how they're going to govern monetary policy.</p>

### 科技巨头动态：OpenAI 面临挑战，英伟达股价剧烈波动

昨天我们收到了关于OpenAI的一些消息。所以，这对于AI叙事也并无帮助。据The Information报道，他们拿到了一份山姆·奥特曼发给公司的泄露备忘录。在这封邮件中，山姆·奥特曼告诉同事，谷歌可能会给OpenAI带来“暂时的经济逆风”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had some news on Open AI yesterday. So, this is also not helping the sort of AI narrative, but Open AI uh the information got a leaked memo from Sam Alman in an email that he sent to the company. And Sam Alman told colleagues that Google could quote create temporary economic headwinds for OpenAI as per the email that was seen by the information.</p>
</details>

首先，如果你是谷歌的股东，这是利好消息，对吧？因为你可以看到山姆·奥特曼可能对Gemini的不断壮大感到有些害怕。但不幸的是，对于AI行业来说，OpenAI不能有暂时的经济逆风。OpenAI需要执行，需要增长，需要在未来四五年内实现数千亿美元的收入，才能使其支出承诺像市场认为的那样合法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, number one, if you're a Google shareholder, bullish, right? Because you can see Sam Alman is potentially getting a little bit of afraid of uh Gemini as it continues to ramp up. But unfortunately for the AI trade, like OpenAI cannot have temporary economic headwinds. Open AI needs to like execute. They need to grow. They need to be doing hundreds of billions of revenue in the next four or five years in order to allow their spending commitments to be as legitimate as the market thinks they're going to be.</p>
</details>

所以，尽管人们讨厌OpenAI，但我确实认为他们需要表现良好。他们不必成为世界上最大的公司，但他们绝对必须做得好。这也使他们上市的能力变得模糊。我的意思是，老兄，我不知道OpenAI是否还值一万亿美元。在过去几周发生的事情之后，我不这么认为。我想他们最终显然会上市，可能会以一万亿或接近一万亿的估值上市。问题是，如果他们今天想上市，他们能从市场上获得一万亿美元的价值并筹集像600、700亿美元吗？可能没那么容易。所以我认为市场会继续密切关注OpenAI的动向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, as much as people hate OpenAI, I do think they need to do well. They don't have to become the biggest company in the world, but they definitely have to do well. It also muddies their ability to go public. I mean, like, dude, I don't know if Open is worth a trillion dollars anymore. Not after what's happened over the past couple weeks. And uh I think eventually they will obviously go public. Probably they're going to go public at a trillion or close to a trillion. Question is today if they want it to go public, could they get a trillion dollars of value from the market and raise like 60 70 billion? Might not be that easy to do. So I think the market's going to keep watching deeply what happens for uh for OpenAI.</p>
</details>

是的，降息概率持续走高。我们现在已经达到了，哇，75%。好吧，所以，如果我是个赌徒，必须说今天市场是涨是跌，我就会看这个数据，然后说也许市场，即使只是一个宽慰性反弹，也会因为认为我们会得到这个而得到一些喘息。75%是三周以来的最高点。所以，这真是令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, rate probabilities continue to go higher. We are now at wow 75%. Okay. So, look, if if if if I was a betting man and I had to say, is the market going up or down today? This would be the stat I look at to say maybe the market, even if it's a relief rally, gets a little bit of reprieve for thinking that we're going to get this right. 75% is higher than we've had in three weeks. So, I mean, that's quite incredible</p>
</details>

仅仅基于威廉姆斯的评论。再次强调，威廉姆斯更像是鲍威尔的代理人。标普指数在盘前并没有疯狂上涨。我们将在大约10分钟后开盘时看看这是否真的反映出来。如果市场下跌，而我们仍然保持75%的可能性，那么我们肯定知道这是别的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just based on Williams comments. Again, William Moore being a proxy for Powell. S&P is not going crazy pre-markets. We'll see when it opens up in about 10 minutes if that actually reflects it. If the market So here's the thing. If the market goes down and we keep those 75% chances, then we definitely know this is something else.</p>
</details>

詹森围绕着他认为整个生态系统的发展方向提出了同样的论点。再说一次，你不可能要求英伟达交出比这更好的季度财报了，真的不可能。所以我真的同意De Doug的观点，整个市场不会在同一秒钟逆转，而这正是我们昨天上午11点所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen making the same argument around where he thinks this entire ecosystem is going. And again, I mean, like you can't you couldn't ask for a better quarter from Nvidia. You just couldn't. So I really do I agree with De Doug right here. the entire market doesn't reverse at the same second, which is what we saw yesterday at 11 a.m.</p>
</details>

而且，英伟达在同一天内市值增加了4500亿美元，又损失了4500亿美元。我是说，英伟达有过一些疯狂的盘中波动，但我认为我们从未见过这样的情况。而且老实说，这也让抛售感觉像是假的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not like again, Nvidia gained 450 billion and lost 450 billion in the same day. I mean, Nvidia's had some crazy intraday swings, but I don't think we've ever seen something like that. And and that also made honestly like that also, we talked about this yesterday, that also made the selling feel fake.</p>
</details>

真的，你先涨4500亿，再跌4500亿。这真的让人觉得不真实。这只是正在发生的事情，你只需要保持偿付能力来应对它。但这并不像是“哦，这是英伟达的末日，是人工智能的末日”。不，它只是感觉像是，好吧，我们先是大幅上涨，然后又大幅下跌。肯定有某个原因，但不是因为英伟达的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like really, you go up 450, then you go down 450. like it it really made it feel like it wasn't real. It was just something that was happening and you just had to stay solvent to to navigate it. But it did not feel like oh this is the end of Nvidia, the end of AI. It's like no, it just felt like okay so we ramped up then we ramped down. There has to be some reason but it's not because of those Nvidia earnings.</p>
</details>

是的，操纵绝对感觉是原因之一。凯西昨天确实逢低买入了。凯西昨天大举买入。她买了英伟达、Coinbase、Bitmine、Circle、Bullish、Robinhood、Archer、Tempest、Crispr，还有一些她投资的基因组学公司，比如Beam和Pacific Biosciences。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, manipulation could definitely feel like one of the reasons. Now Kathy did buy the dip yesterday. Cathy went to town buying uh yesterday. So she bought Nvidia, Coinbase, Bitmine, Circle, Bullish, Robin Hood, Archer, Tempest, Crisper, um and some of the heard genomics plays like Beam and Pacific Biosciences.</p>
</details>

卖出很少，但买入很多很多。买了更多Bitmine，买了更多Bullish，只卖了一点点。所以，是的，有些机构投资者说：“不，这些价格太愚蠢了，尤其是在这些财报之后，我们要买更多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very little selling, but a lot a lot of buying. Bought more Bitmine, bought more bullish, and sold just a little bit. So, I mean, yeah, you had some institutional investors say, "No, these are stupid prices, especially after these earnings, and we're going to be buying more."</p>
</details>

### 知名分析师解读：市场疲劳还是深层问题？

这是彭博社或其中一个消息来源称，有一份来自詹森的泄露备忘录。这是詹森据称在财报后的全体员工会议上说的话。他说：“如果我们交出了一份糟糕的季度报告，那就证明了存在AI泡沫。如果我们交出了一份出色的季度报告，我们就是在助长AI泡沫。”詹森说，“对英伟达的期望如此之高，以至于公司陷入了一种两难的境地。”他提到了网上关于公司巨大经济影响力的讨论。然后他又说了一句话：“如果我们交出了一份糟糕的季度报告，如果我们只差一点点，如果它看起来只是有点摇摇欲坠，整个世界都会崩溃。这一点毫无疑问。你应该看看网上的一些表情包。你们看过一些吗？我们基本上是在维系着这个星球，这并非不真实。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's I think this was Bloomberg or this is one of these sources saying there was a leaked memo from Jensen. Um, uh, yeah. Okay. So, this is this is the quote. I don't know if it's fully accurate, but I I think there are some good sources saying this. So, this is what Jensen apparently said at an all hands meeting after the earnings. Uh, if we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble. Jensen said, "The expectations for Nvidia were so sky-high that the company was in somewhat of a no-win situation." He nodded to online chatter about the company's massive economic sway. And then he had another quote. If we delivered a bad quarter, if we're off by just a hair, if it just looked like a bit creaky, the whole world would have fallen apart. There's no question about that. You should have seen some of the memes that are on the internet. Have you guys seen some of them? We're basically holding the planet together, and it's not untrue.</p>
</details>

所以，你确实有一些可能来自詹森的言论在流传，他承认市场对他们财报的重视程度，以及他知道他们交付一份好季报的责任，但他也知道这就像一个“第二十二条军规”。如果季报不好，就是AI泡沫。如果季报很好，就是在助长泡沫，对此他无能为力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, you do have some quotes potentially floating around from Jensen where he's acknowledging how like serious the market is taking their earnings and how he knows the responsibility of them delivering a good quarter, but he also knows that like it's a catch 22. If it's a bad quarter, it's an AI bubble. If it's a great quarter, it's fueling the bubble, which, you know, there's not much he can do about that at that point.</p>
</details>

好的，我们收到了汤姆·李的消息。他刚刚在他的频道上发布了一个视频。让我们看看李先生是怎么说的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right we got Tom Lee here. Just posted a video on his channel. Let's see what Mr. Lee is saying.</p>
</details>

市场见顶并出现相当大的下跌，收盘时下跌了3.5%，导致我们全天下跌了1.6%。我认为很多人都感到失望，因为英伟达的业绩非常出色。那么是什么导致了这次逆转呢？虽然股票下跌的原因并不总是很清楚，但我们认为有五种可能的解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">peaked and staged a pretty sizable decline with a three and a half% decline into the close and that took us down 1.6 for the day. Now again, I think many people are disappointed because Nvidia had great numbers. So what caused this reversal? Well, it's not always clear why stocks fall, but we do think there are five possible explanations for this.</p>
</details>

首先，我认为这次崩盘背后的一个因素是一些推文在社交媒体上引发了一些愤怒，那是特朗普总统回应一些民主党资深人士，暗示他们可以无视国会的命令。第一条推文是在上午9点17分。第二条是在上午10点21分。他说：“煽动性行为可判处死刑。”请注意时间戳，是10点21分。而市场就在几分钟后开始下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, I think one factor behind the meltdown was that there were some tweets that that created a little bit of outrage on social media and it was President Trump responding to some Democratic uh veterans suggesting that they can ignore orders from Congress. And uh and that first tweet was at 9:17 a.m. The second one came at 10:21 a.m. He said, "Sedicious behavior punishable by death." Now, notice the time stamp. That's 10:21. And the market turned down just a few minutes later.</p>
</details>

那条推文导致民主党国会议员和领导人抗议针对民主党成员的死亡威胁。现在，我认为导致下跌的第二件事是爱泼斯坦文件。特朗普总统签署了《爱泼斯坦文件透明法案》成为法律，现在已下令公布这些文件。这些文件中会有很多人。事实上，有人指出，这甚至可能让许多捐助者、亿万富翁捐助者感到尴尬。所以你可以想象，可能会有投资者只是紧张谁会出现在那份名单上，如果名单被揭露，是否会对市场产生影响。我认为这加剧了今天的一些紧张情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That tweet led to Democratic Congress members and uh leaders protesting the death threats against Democratic members. Now, the second thing that I think did contribute to the decline is the Epstein files. So, President Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law and now has ordered uh these files to be released. There's going to be a lot of people in those files. In fact, um for instance, here's someone pointing out that it could even uh embarrass uh many donors, billionaire donors. So, you can imagine there might be investors who are just nervous who's going to be on that list and it's revealed does it do something to markets. I think that contributed to some of the nervousness today.</p>
</details>

第三个因素是加密货币。比特币最近一直在抛售，通常领先于股市，但你可以看到，在开盘时，比特币见顶并在9:30开始走弱，而标普500指数基本上在一小时后跟进。这种情况已经持续了一段时间。我曾指出比特币一直在引领标普指数。例如，比特币在10月10日见顶，那正是在我们经历那次流动性冲击之前，那次冲击最终成为加密货币历史上最大的流动性冲击，抹去了超过200万个账户。自那以后比特币一直在下跌。但正如你在这里看到的，这导致了标普蜘蛛ETF在10月29日见顶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third factor is crypto. Um, Bitcoin has been selling off recently, uh, and generally has led the equities, but you can see at the open, Bitcoin peaked and began to to weaken at 9:30 and the S&P followed basically an hour later. This has been the case for some time. It's something I've pointed out that Bitcoin has been leading the S&P. For instance, Bitcoin peaked on October 10th. Um, that's right before we had that liquidity shock, which ended up being the biggest liquidity shock in the history of crypto, wiping out more than 2 million accounts. and and Bitcoin's been falling since. But as you can see here, this has led to um the S&P spider peaking on October 29th.</p>
</details>

第四个因素是甲骨文和**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swaps, CDS: 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者对冲信用风险），因为关于这个有很多议论。如你所知，有许多AI的怀疑者，甚至有人质疑英伟达的数据，但引起人们注意的是甲骨文的信用违约互换正在上升。这可能是投资者在对冲……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fourth factor is Oracle um and CDS because there was quite a lot of chatter about this. As you know, there's many skeptics of AI, people even questioning Nvidia's numbers, but what's catching people's eyes is Oracle's credit default swaps are rising. This could be investors hedging against um</p>
</details>

所以马特的观点与汤姆的相反。他基本上说他不同意汤姆的看法。他说：“是的，汤姆提到了10月10日的一点，但那只是原因的一小部分。”我的意思是，你看到其他在加密货币领域颇具影响力的人，比如Bitwise的首席执行官马特·霍根，都在说：“我不同意汤姆的看法。我不认为这个故障是原因。”他将其归咎于全球流动性问题，坦率地说，我认为这是一个比软件故障好得多的解释。所以你在加密货币领域的思想领袖之间看到了一些真正的分歧，他们并没有强调汤姆·李的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Matt's going the opposite direction of Tom. I mean, he basically said he doesn't agree with Tom. He's like, "Yeah, Tom was making a point about October 10th, but that's a small reason for why." I mean, like, you're getting other people who are pretty influential in the crypto space, like Matt Hogan, um, again, CEO of Bitwise, saying, "I don't agree with Tom. I don't I don't think that this glitch is the reason he he's he's blaming it on global liquidity, which quite frankly I think is a much better explanation, not a software glitch. So you're getting some real divergence there of thought leaders in the crypto space that are that are not um sort of uh underscoring Tom Lee's argument.</p>

### 市场展望与个人策略

我昨晚和史蒂夫谈过这个。这完全取决于你个人的生活状况，对吧？比如你的账单，你的家庭等等。对我来说，我持有这些股票中的很多。我买入它们的价格比现在便宜很多，尽管它们现在大幅下跌，因为这些都是我多年来建立的头寸。我认为备兑看涨期权（covered calls）是在这种时候至少能产生一些缓冲的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I I me and Steve were talking about this last night. It is so contingent on your individual personal life, right? Like and your bills that you have to pay your family, etc. For me, I'm holding a lot of these names. I got in at a lot cheaper than the prices that they are today, even though they're down significantly because those are positions you've been building for years. Um, I think covered calls are way to at least generate some level of cushion during a time like this.</p>
</details>

其次，我不知道我是否会……再说一次，英伟达，我的平均成本是122美元。在他们发布了有史以来最好的季度财报后，我会在178美元卖掉英伟达，试图以低于122美元的价格再买回来吗？我觉得这很难做到。如果我在这件事上错了，那我就错了。但想到在我今年花了那么多功夫建立仓位之后，我能以低于122美元的价格买到英伟达，这就像，不，我就是让它待着。我就想，是的，它没有涨到200美元，但它仍然远高于122美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And second of all, it's just like I don't know if I like, again, Nvidia, I'm at 122 on an average. Am I selling Nvidia 178 after the best quarter they ever had to try to buy it lower than 122? It's like I just find that very hard to. And if I'm wrong about that, I'll just be wrong. But the idea that I'm going to get Nvidia below 122 after all the work I spent this year building out a position, it's like, no, I just like I'm just letting it stay. I'm like, yeah, it's not going up to 200, but it's also still way above 122.</p>
</details>

我想我们很多人都处于同样的位置。如果你在20美元时大量买入了Rocket Lab，那么，好吧，它现在不是70美元了，但你真的会在39美元时卖出，因为你认为它会回到20美元吗？不。所以，现在如果你需要钱，如果你需要去杠杆，如果你用了保证金，那些都是不同的情况，你可能别无选择。你可能不得不退出一些头寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think a lot of us are in that same position. If you load it up on Rocket Lab at 20, it's like, okay, it's not at 70 anymore, but you really sell at 39 because you think it goes back to 20. No. So now if you need the money, if you need to delever, if you're on margin, like those are all different things where you might not have a choice.

我认为最重要的事情是在这些时候保持偿付能力，因为如果这真的只是一些关于流动性、美联储降息、加密货币故障等等的无稽之谈，而我们在未来六个月，甚至更早的时间里出现逆转，那么你只需要保持偿付能力，不要被追加保证金，这样你至少还有资本和能力让投资组合回到那些水平。

<p class="english-text">And I think the most important thing is to stay solvent in these times because if this really is just some nonsense liquidity, Fed rate cut, crypto glitch, yada yada, and we're reversing over the next six months, maybe even sooner than that, then you just you got to stay solvent and not get margin called so that you at least have the capital and the ability for the portfolio to get back to those levels.</p>

但是，如果你不需要这笔钱，并且你很乐意让这些头寸继续持有，而且你不是在积极交易，那么不，我认为持有并不是……我认为在这个时候，卖出的时机是一个月前，对吧？所以，在这些股票下跌了30%到40%之后，你真的会卖出吗？很难想象，除非你完全失去了信心，那又是另一个问题了。

<p class="english-text">But if you don't need the money and you're happy with just letting these positions ride out and you're not actively trading it, then no, I think I think holding is not the I think at this again the time to sell was just like a month ago, right? So it's like do you really sell after a 30 to 40% decline on a lot of these names? It's hard to imagine that unless you fully lost conviction, then it's then it's a different question.</p>

是的，这可能只是一个早期的黑色星期五促销。也可能是这种情况。只要它们是七巨头，我就会接住下落的刀子。其他的我不会碰。这也非常公平。我的意思是，如果你在217美元买入亚马逊，它跌到200美元，归根结底，它是亚马逊。但其他一些公司，你知道，它们可能还有很长的下跌空间，而且它们的护城河不像亚马逊那么坚固，这就是为什么人们可能想要等待。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, this could be just an early Black Friday sale. That could also that could also be the case. I will catch a following knife as long as they're max seven. Others I won't touch. That's also very fair. I mean, if you buy Amazon at 217 and it goes to 200, like at the end of the day, it's Amazon. But some of these other names, you know, they might have a lot farther down to go and their moes are not as strong as Amazon, which is why, you know, people might be wanting to wait.</p>

我们能回到4800点吗？这是个好问题。我个人会说不。我不认为……我的意思是那不仅仅是放弃今年的收益。那是放弃2024年、2023年和整个2022年的收益，尽管2022年是下跌的一年。所以我们上一次在4800点是2022年1月。

<p class="english-text">Could we go back down to 4,800? That's a great question. I personally would say no. I don't think I mean that would be that's not just giving up this year's of gains. That's giving up 2024 and 2023 and all of 2022 even though 2022 was a down year. So about last time we were at 4,800 was January 2022.</p>

所以我们谈论的是四年的收益。这就是为什么4800点在四月份如此愚蠢，因为真的，我们应该失去四年的收益吗？但话说回来，是什么导致了逆转？不是市场认为它愚蠢。是特朗普逆转了关税。就像，特朗普一说“买入”，并且我们将暂停90天来谈判互惠关税之类的，我们就在盘中反弹了10%。

<p class="english-text">So I mean we're talking about four years of G. That's why 4800 was so stupid in April because like really do we deserve to lose four years of gains? But then again, what caused the reversal? It wasn't the market thinking that it was stupid. It was Trump reversing the tariffs. Like, as soon as Trump said buy and that we're going to like give a 90-day pause to negotiate reciprocal tariffs or whatever, that's when we rally 10% intraday.</p>

所以，市场能在没有借口的情况下下跌吗？如果他们没有像特朗普推文那样的催化剂说“买入”，他们会一直下跌吗？我的意思是，是的，这就是我们一直在经历的。那会再次是4800点吗？我不这么认为。但无论如何，这次更棘手，因为上次我们知道我们为什么下跌。这次就不那么容易理解了。

<p class="english-text">So, could the markets go down, you know, without an excuse? And and if they don't have a sort of uh catalyst like a Trump tweet that says buy, could they stay down? I mean, yeah, that's what we've been experiencing. Would that be 4,800 again? I don't think so. But nonetheless, this is more tricky because last time we knew why we were down. This time it's not as easy to understand.</p>
