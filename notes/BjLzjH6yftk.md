### 俄军士兵遭遇残酷对待

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是本期新闻摘要。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 12 月 31 日，星期三。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, December 31st. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我有严重的头部创伤。弹片穿透了我的中枢神经系统。为什么他们还不让我出院？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: I have a severe head wound. Shrapnel pierced my central nervous system. Why haven't they discharged me?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 《泰晤士报》获得了超过 6,000 份俄罗斯士兵及其家属提交的机密投诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Times has gotten access to more than 6,000 confidential complaints filed by Russian soldiers and their families.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他们像对待狗一样对待我们。他们把我关在坑里一个半星期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: They're treating us like dogs. They held me in a pit for a week and a half.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这些投诉共同揭示了莫斯科如何通过一系列残暴和胁迫手段来维持其在**乌克兰**的战争努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Together, they show how Moscow has used a pattern of brutality and coercion to keep up its war effort in Ukraine.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他甚至拿不稳勺子或叉子，现在却要被送回特别军事行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: He can't even hold a spoon or fork, and now he's being sent back to the special military operation.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我的同事 **Paul Sony** 是审查这些文件的团队成员之一，这些文件包括那些被俄罗斯政府无意中在线发布、并被一家流亡的俄罗斯媒体分享给《泰晤士报》的全部资料。随后，《泰晤士报》追踪了数十名提交这些指控的人，以核实其真实性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: My colleague Paul Sony is part of the team that reviewed the documents, including those excerpts, after the whole trove was inadvertently put online by the Russian government and shared with the Times by an exiled Russian media outlet. The Times then tracked down dozens of people who'd filed the allegations to verify their authenticity.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在阅读这些投诉时，我们发现了证据，表明有人在身患严重伤病——包括晚期癌症、脑瘫，以及肢体断裂或缺失——的情况下仍被派往前线。一份附在投诉中的视频显示，一些士兵拄着拐杖四处走动，但据称他们仍被派往前线作战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Reading through the complaints, we found evidence of people being sent into battle despite serious injuries and illnesses, advanced cancer, cerebral palsy, and broken and missing limbs. One of the videos attached to a complaint shows men walking around on crutches as they are allegedly being sent into battle.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我们还发现了严重虐待的证据。士兵们被自己的指挥官殴打、绑在树上，并经常被置于极其不人道的条件下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: We also found evidence of significant abuse. Soldiers who were beaten by their own commanders, tied to trees, and often held in really inhumane conditions.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在数千份文件中，最令人不安的指控包括提到了“**abna**”，这是一种在**俄罗斯**军队中普遍存在的、甚至有自己名称的惯例。它是指指挥官杀害自己的士兵，无论是直接在战场上处决他们，还是将他们派往已知他们无法返回的地方。我们在超过 100 份投诉中发现了指挥官威胁要杀死自己士兵的证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Among the thousands of documents, the most disturbing allegations were complaints that mentioned abna, which is a practice in the Russian military that is common enough to have its own name. And it's a term for a commander killing his own soldiers, whether executing them directly on the battlefield or sending them into battle into a place he knows they won't return. We found in more than 100 complaints, threats by commanders to kill their own soldiers.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 当你阅读所有这些投诉时，我认为你会感觉到，系统内的暴力以及**俄罗斯**士兵所感受到的恐惧是一种“特性”，而非“缺陷”。正是**弗拉基米尔·普京**让他的士兵在**乌克兰**保持进攻状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: When you're reading all of the complaints, I think you get a sense that the violence within the system and the fear that Russian soldiers have is a feature, not a bug. It's how Vladimir Putin keeps his soldiers on the attack in Ukraine.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **克里姆林宫**和**俄罗斯国防部**未对多次置评请求作出回应。您可以在 ny times.com 上找到完整的调查报告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to multiple requests for comment. You can find the full investigation at ny times.com.

</details>

### 爱泼斯坦文件审查更新

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，来自华盛顿的两则简短更新。首先，《泰晤士报》获悉了**司法部**（**DOJ**）在审查**爱泼斯坦**案件文件方面还剩下多少文件的新细节。本月早些时候，在**国会**下令公开后，司法部公开了约 10 万页与其对已定罪性犯罪者调查相关的文件。随后，该部门表示，至少还有一百万份文件需要审查。现在，消息人士告诉《泰晤士报》，该部门正在审查 520 万页文件。司法部正试图招募约 400 名律师来梳理这些文件，并编辑掉有关受害者或其他敏感信息。该过程预计将持续到至少 1 月 20 日。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two quick updates from Washington. First, the Times has learned new details about just how many documents the Justice Department has left to review in the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the DOJ made about a 100,000 pages of files related to its investigations of the convicted sex offender public after Congress ordered the release. The department then said it had at least a million more documents that still needed to be reviewed. Now, sources tell the Times it's reviewing 5.2 million pages of documents. The DOJ is trying to enlist about 400 of its lawyers to comb through the files and redact any details about victims or other sensitive information. The process is expected to take until at least January 20th.

### 明尼苏达州托儿欺诈指控

**Tracy Mumford**: 此外，有报道称，记者们对**明尼苏达州**的托儿项目进行了耸人听闻且可信的欺诈指控。州卫生与公众服务部官员表示，在一位右翼网红发布了一段声称揭露**Somalrun**日托中心存在普遍欺诈的视频后几天，他们已暂停了明尼苏达州 1.85 亿美元的托儿费用支付。虽然视频中没有一家中心被当局指控欺诈，但这引发了保守派要求在该州进行打击的新一轮呼吁。近年来，该州已有数十人（许多是索马里裔）因一项庞大的社会服务欺诈计划而被定罪，检察官称该计划耗费纳税人数十亿美元。在资金冻结后的一份声明中，民主党州长**Tim Walls**表示：“欺诈是一个严重的问题，但这是一种试图将该问题政治化以伤害莫坦斯人并削减帮助人们的政府项目的透明企图。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Also, intrepid journalists have made shocking and credible allegations of extensive fraud in Minnesota's childare programs. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services say they have blocked $185 million in child care payments to Minnesota days after a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming to uncover rampant fraud at Somalrun daycare centers there. While none of the centers in the video have been accused of fraud by authorities, it sparked a new wave of calls by conservatives for a crackdown in the state. In recent years, dozens of people there, many of them Somali, have been convicted in a sprawling social services fraud scheme that prosecutors say cost taxpayers billions of dollars. In a statement after the funding freeze, the Democratic Governor Tim Walls said, quote, "Fraud is a serious issue, but this is a transparent attempt to politicize the issue to hurt motans and defund government programs that help people.

### 加沙人道主义组织面临暂停

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**加沙**，从明天起，三十多家**人道主义组织**的运营授权将被暂停，此前**以色列政府**表示，它们未遵守新的注册规定。以色列称，这些规定要求各组织提供有关其工作人员的详细信息，目的是清除武装分子，而以色列声称这些武装分子过去曾渗透到援助组织中。但许多组织反对这些要求，称它们将使工作人员面临风险，尤其是在人道主义和医疗工作者遭受骚扰和袭击的时候。**无国界医生组织**（Doctors Without Borders）是预计将被暂停的组织之一，该组织必须在 3 月前撤出加沙。该组织警告说，这将对**巴勒斯坦人**造成毁灭性后果。该组织表示，它支持该地区约 20% 的医院床位以及三分之一的婴儿接生服务。与此同时，以色列官员辩称，被暂停的组织对向加沙居民提供援助并不重要，并表示它们仅提供了该地区一小部分人道主义援助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Gaza, as of tomorrow, more than three dozen humanitarian groups will have their authorization to operate in the territory suspended after the Israeli government said they did not comply with new registration rules. Israel says the rules, which require the groups to provide detailed information about their workers, are meant to weed out militants, which it claims have infiltrated aid groups in the past. But many of the groups have objected to the requirements, saying they exposed their staff to risk at a time when humanitarian and healthcare workers have been subject to harassment and attacks. Doctors Without Borders, one of the groups that's expected to be suspended and will have to clear out of Gaza by March, warned that there would be devastating consequences for Palestinians. The organization said it supports about 20% of all hospital beds in the territory and the delivery of one in three babies there. Israeli officials, meanwhile, argued the suspended groups are not critical to providing aid to Gazans, saying they only supply a fraction of the humanitarian assistance there.

### 年度趣味新闻回顾

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，这是我们本年度的最后一期节目。我们通常会用《泰晤士报》报道的那些“我真没料到”的故事来结束节目。今年有很多这样的故事。所以，在我们结束 2025 年之际，这里有一些亮点。如果我告诉你，有一个第 13 个星座呢？今年我们了解到，我们的星座可能都错了，因为在过去 2000 年里，地球对恒星的视角发生了偏移。涂层不是巧克力，而是巧克力味涂层。我们了解到，许多人最喜欢的巧克力棒不再像以前那么“巧克力”了，因为可可价格因气候变化而上涨。我们还了解到，鲨鱼会发出声音。尽管科学家们长期以来一直认为它们是“沉默的强者”，但事实并非如此。还有龙，特别是浪漫奇幻小说。我们追踪了浪漫小说如何成为最热门的文学类型，以至于它支撑着整个虚构市场。我们还关注了那些试图投掷石片最远的人，或者模仿海鸥叫声最像的人——这些都是真实的年度比赛，如果你想为明年开始练习的话。我们还告别了已停产的便士，并再次迎来了科学家们从灭绝中复活的恐狼。还有一些非常实在的生活建议，比如官员们提醒人们不要在活火山上滑雪（说的是你，埃特纳火山），以及在这个一年中的特殊时期，比利时卫生官员警告人们不要吃圣诞树。我们将在 2026 年回归。

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, this is our very last episode of the year, and we usually round out the show with the most "I did not know that" stories that the Times is covering. There have been a lot of them. So, here are a few highlights as we close out 2025. What if I told you that there is a 13th zodiac sign? This was the year we learned our horoscopes might all be wrong since the Earth's view of the stars has shifted over the last 2,000 years. The coating is not chocolate, it's chocolate flavored coating. We learned a lot of people's favorite chocolate bars aren't as chocolaty as they used to be as cocoa prices have been driven up by climate change. We also learned sharks can make noise. Even though scientists had long thought of them as the strong silent type. um, dragons and romance specifically like romance and fantasy. We tracked how romantic has become the hottest literary genre out there to the point that it's propping up the whole fiction market. We checked in with people trying to skip rocks the farthest or sound the most like seagulls, which are both real annual competitions in case you want to start practicing now for next year. We also said goodbye to the penny, which is no longer in production, and hello again to the direwolf, which scientists brought back from extinction. And there were some moments of really solid life advice, like officials reminding people not to ski down active volcanoes, looking at you, Mount Etna, and a timely bit of wisdom for this time of year when health officials in Belgium warned people not to eat their Christmas trees.
