### “披萨门”阴谋论的复活与档案的冲击

爱泼斯坦（Jeffrey Epstein）档案的最新披露，再次将十年前曾被主流媒体嗤之以鼻的“披萨门”（PizzaGate）阴谋论推向风口浪尖。最初，“披萨门”源于美国共和党内一个名为 **QAnon** 的边缘团体，他们活跃于一些右翼在线论坛。2016年，希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）竞选团队高级助理的电子邮件被泄露至 **维基解密**（WikiLeaks），其中包含大量隐晦提及“披萨”的词句，被QAnon解读为儿童性交易的暗语。当时，这一理论被广泛认为是荒谬且毫无根据的，甚至有一名信徒持枪闯入一家披萨店，试图“解救”被贩卖的儿童，尽管无人伤亡，但事件的荒诞性加深了公众对该理论的负面印象。

然而，随着爱泼斯坦档案的解密，公众发现“披萨”一词多次以异常语境出现在爱泼斯坦的邮件中，例如“服药后洗手，然后我们吃披萨喝葡萄汽水”。这种不自然的组合，加上爱泼斯坦对自身健康和饮食的严格管理，使得“披萨”作为暗语的可能性大大增加。右翼网络名人塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）在福克斯新闻（Fox News）任职时曾嘲笑“披萨门”信徒精神失常，但在阅读爱泼斯坦档案后，他承认自己开始重新审视这一理论。最关键的证据是一张爱泼斯坦与泌尿科医生哈里·菲什（Harry Fish）的对话截图，医生在为其开具勃起功能障碍药物后，竟建议他“洗手，然后我们去吃披萨喝葡萄汽水”。这种在性行为准备阶段提及披萨的语境，几乎明确无误地指向了其作为某种秘密代号的性质。

爱泼斯坦档案的发布，源于《爱泼斯坦透明法案》（Epstein Transparency Act）的通过，迫使美国司法部（DOJ）公开了超过三百万页文件、两千多段视频和十八万张图片，涵盖了多起相关案件。然而，司法部在保护受害者隐私方面却遭遇了灾难性失败。两名专门代理爱泼斯坦案受害者的律师严厉谴责司法部，指出其在文件发布后，不仅未能有效保护受害者隐私，反而暴露了大量受害者信息，甚至公开了同谋者的姓名，其处理方式被指责为“蓄意”而非“无能”。更令人担忧的是，仍有250万份文件被扣押，这引发了人们对未公开内容可能更加“令人作呕”的猜测。这些已公开的档案内容之冲击力，已然在全球政治舞台和精英阶层中引发了巨大震动，尽管美国政府试图淡化影响，但挪威、英国、法国等多个国家已受到波及。

okay, let's take a look at this Epstein document. first, I don't know if you've been following this series of content, you know, in the republican party, there's actually a fringe group called QAnon. these people are very active on some online forums, such as 4chan and some other right wing forums. Conspiracy theories, you know, ten years ago, they had a very popular conspiracy theory called pizza gate. I don't know if you pay attention to it back then. oh, I really didn't what was the reason for pizza gate back then? during Hillary Clinton and Trump's election campaign, one of Hillary's top aides had their account hacked. a large number of emails were leaked to WikiLeaks, put on various public platforms, and everyone could see them among them. they found many veiled references, like, let's go eat pizza today or what kind of pizza, these were clearly coded messages. code name is something that's inconvenient to say in the email. so they used pizza as a substitute. so when this rumor came out, it was actually rejected by the mainstream media. everyone thought it was too outrageous. pizza gate question mark, in their theory at the time was that there was a global network of elites in the United States involved in sex trafficking and child's sexual abuse. the main leader of this network was Hillary Clinton, and the democratic party elites were all going to this place to enjoy this kind of pedophilia service. then many republican supporters believed it. one guy even took a gun and went to a pizza shop and started shooting, although no one was killed. it is said that he shot through a hard drive, then they said that there might be a basement in a pizza shop where these trafficked and abducted children were being held, and they were trying to rescue them. when this news came out, many people thought wow, this is too outrageous. it sounds like a conspiracy theory, it's just this kind of utterly stupid conspiracy theory completely baseless. anyone who believes this stuff is mentally ill. but anyway, after the new year, these Epstein documents were released. I don't know if you seen them, but they've become very popular recently. many people have noticed that the word pizza appears several times in Epstein's emails. it appears in some very strange contexts, like after you take this medicine, we'll wash our hands. and then we eat pizza and a grape soda. that's all coded language, right? the fact that it appears several times is very strange. first. let me give you a recap of why these documents were released in the first place. it's because after the Epstein Transparency Act was passed, it had to go into effect because it's a law, if the DOJ doesn't comply, they could be violating the law. and in fact, they already have, in the end, over three million pages were released, along with over two thousand videos and one hundred eighty thousand images. it also covered many things, including the Florida case, the New York case, the Maxwell case and the prison death investigation in an unprecedented number of pages. however, it was a catastrophic failure in terms of privacy protection. two lawyers who specifically represent Epstein's victims, have quickly warned the Department of Justice, saying you spend so much manpower resources covering up privacy of these victims. and then you find that after these documents were released, it's the most serious violation of victim privacy in American history. you can't just describe this situation as incompetence. it's almost as if they did it intentionally exposing all these victims and releasing the names of people who were clearly accomplices or involved in these transactions. it would have been better to just use the "redacted". clearly, their handling of this matter resulted in a disastrous outcome. these are two lawyers who specialized defending these victims in this Epstein case, helping them sue these celebrities in Epstein's network. these two lawyers came forward to say this. and at the same time, you should know that the Epstein document law actually requires you to disclose all documents. but in fact, we are still missing two point five million documents. yes, we are still missing two point five million, actually only three point five million have been released so far. so the withholding of these documents makes people think that recently, because the three million documents released recently are so shocking. there is too much that is indecent and disgusting. and after reading them, it has actually affected the global political arena. and global elites. it's just that in the United States, our government is basically shameless. now everyone is pretending that nothing happened. but in fact, you can see that other countries like Norway, the UK and France have all been affected, including Czechoslovakia, Slovenia. right now, many people are questioning whether the two point five million documents you withheld are even worse than the three million. the current inference is that it definitely is because look how bad these three million are right, exposing so much. Yes, this basically implicates all the elite classes in Europe and America, doesn't it? All the scandalous details of this case are revealed. yes, this brings us back to the pizzagate conspiracy theory we mentioned at the beginning. this is exactly the tenth anniversary of the pizza gate conspiracy theory, and in this Epstein document, the appearance of a large number of specific words has led many people to believe that they should apologize to those QAnon people who promoted pizza gate back then, because they actually said some things correctly. this was the crisis related email that triggered the pizza gate conspiracy theory and QAnon has been supporting this, saying this is better than a Chinese cookie. see you later. let's go for pizza and grape soda. again. quote, no one else can understand the phrase. pizza and grape soda was sent to Epstein by someone else. if you look at it alone, you might think it's normal right? two good friends after finishing something going to eat pizza and drink soda isn't that normal. but if you look at Epstein, he actually takes very good care of his body, he's a wealthy person and people in that class generally pay a lot of attention to their bodies and diet for someone like him to eat pizza and grape soda is a bit far fetched. but if you look at his physique, you can see that he probably doesn't eat pizza every day. yes, someone who eats pizza every day would look like Trump or Bill Gates, right? it's definitely coded language, and you wouldn't get tired of eating the same thing every day, right? it's very strange that he would eat that every day, then Tucker Carlson recently did a program which just came out where he said that in the unsealed judicial document, the word pizza was mentioned unusually frequently, which made him revalue the pizza gate conspiracy theory. you know, he's a right wing online celebrity back when he was at Fox News, he thought that those who talked about pizzagate were crazy, mentally ill people who believed in conspiracy theories. but after reading the documents, he said, oh, my god, I'm starting to rethink this. now, the most crucial piece of text. here, I'll show you a screen shot. this is a conversation between Epstein and his doctor. the doctor's name is Harry Fish, and he's a urologist. he was prescribing medication for erectile dysfunction to Epstein. you know, Epstein was probably older something, and he had erectile dysfunction. he needed this medication for someone who is so obsessed with sex, and so enthusiastic about pedophilia having this condition was very painful for him. so after he took that medication, the doctor just told him to wash his hands after using the medication. and then we went to eat pizza and grape soda. you can see that the pizza and grape soda correspond to the email you just saw earlier, but this part appears in a screen shot of a conversation. yes, he said, you can get this medication soon, call him. and then after calling him after you use this medication, wash your hands, and then we'll go eat pizza, grape soda. think about it. after taking medication for erectile dysfunction, why would you go eat pizza? shouldn't you be doing other things? right? yes, you should be doing things you enjoy doing right? so you can see this is clearly a coded message. yes, yes, so it's no wonder people are suspicious right when you've taken the medication and are ready to have sex. what does eating pizza mean? basically, I think everyone pretty much understands what's going on. you can see the logical chain here, then he said on the show that Carlson said that given his notorious history of sex crimes and also his use of code for illegal activities because he himself was communicating with these intelligence organizations, right? helping to smuggle weapons and getting these wealthy and influential people to invest in these Israeli companies involved in national defence. so you can see that this is a very clear coded message. that's why PizzaGate is relevant again. this reminds people of the Podesta email leak. there was exposed ten years ago, which included things like a hot dog with forty thousand dollars, that's very unnatural. you know, a Costco. we buy a hot dog and soda for less than two dollars. yes, one dollar and fifty cents. a while ago, the party and national leaders just ate four hot dogs in Kiel, and you held this founding of the party and nation conference is very cheap. then let's look at this Comet Ping Pong incident. there was a pizza shop called Comet Ping Pong. a man believing in QAnon went there with a gun and shot at a hard drive. but what's very strange according to news reports is that this man was killed by police in North Carolina shortly before these documents were released. this is something they mentioned in the program today, which is very interesting. also, there's the involvement of Barr who was the head of the DOJ during the Trump administration. Epstein privately referred to Barr as a CIA person because Barr had worked for the CIA. but when he was at the DOJ, he wasn't in charge of the CIA, right? so the influence of Barr on this matter was very significant consider that Barr's father was one of Epstein's lawyers, and under his tenure, Epstein died in prison, supposedly by suicide. but we know there are many unanswered questions surrounding this case, and it hasn't been truly resolved to this day. furthermore, Mike Pompeo had a plan to assassinate Julian Assange. you know, who Assange is right. the WikiLeaks guy, he was trying to cover up the true source of the democratic party email leaks, because he felt this action was deeply controlled the intelligence leaks related to Epstein. it's basically generally accepted now that Epstein is an asset of an intelligence agency, and it uses blackmail to control, powerful people globally, especially its relationship with the former Israeli prime minister and related organizations. and in these emails, it also exposed something else that he once ran a company called Liquid Funding Limited, which specialized in selling, CDOs that led to the two thousand eight financial crisis before Bear Stearns collapsed. he accurately hedged his assets and closed his company getting out completely unscathed. this has led to a new conspiracy theory, suggesting that Epstein actually contributed to the two thousand eight financial crisis, specifically that he wanted to trigger the crisis through this method. of course, this conspiracy theory is a bit far fetched, but many people are questioning this now because he did run his own company that specifically sold CDOs.

### 全球精英的信任危机与西方人权话语权的崩塌

爱泼斯坦档案的曝光，不仅在美国国内引发轩然大波，更在全球范围内对精英阶层和西方国家的人权话语权造成了巨大冲击。美国政府对事件的“不作为”和“厚颜无耻”的态度，使得其他国家，如挪威、英国、法国、捷克斯洛伐克和斯洛文尼亚，纷纷受到波及。许多人质疑，司法部刻意扣押的250万份文件，是否比已公开的300万份更加不堪入目，因为后者已经揭露了足以牵连欧美所有精英阶层的丑闻细节。

在英国，前驻美大使 **彼得·曼德尔森**（Peter Mandelson: 英国政治家，曾任工党政府大臣，被视为英国政坛的“造王者”）的牵连尤为严重。档案显示，他在2008年金融危机后，不仅与爱泼斯坦分享了英国内阁讨论的敏感政府文件，这无疑构成了叛国罪，还向爱泼斯坦提供了自己穿着衬衫和内裤与一名女性的合影。这些行为导致他在2025年末被迫辞去大使职务，并于今年2月2日宣布辞去上议院议员身份，政治生涯彻底终结。英国警方已就其泄露机密信息展开刑事调查。首相被迫公开道歉，承认被曼德尔森的谎言蒙蔽，但反对党则借机猛烈抨击首相的“软弱、天真和轻信”，质疑其与恋童癖者频繁接触的判断力。

在美国，前参议员、北爱尔兰和平协议设计师 **乔治·米切尔**（George Mitchell）也因与爱泼斯坦的频繁会面而声誉扫地，被迫辞去其研究所的职务，并被多家公共机构从荣誉项目中除名。尽管加拿大前总理 **马克·卡尼**（Mark Carney）的名字在邮件中多次出现，主要因他订阅了爱泼斯坦的国际金融通讯，且未被发现有直接参与爱泼斯坦岛屿派对等活动，其影响相对较小。然而，挪威王室则面临严峻考验，挪威王储曾主动联系爱泼斯坦，希望与他会面并参加派对，这使得挪威王室备受审视。此外，世界经济论坛（World Economic Forum）主席 **克劳斯·施瓦布**（Klaus Schwab）也被曝与爱泼斯坦多次共进商务晚餐，世界经济论坛董事会已对此展开调查，这无疑加深了公众对全球精英阶层信任的瓦解。

爱泼斯坦案的曝光，对西方国家长期以来引以为傲的“人权话语权”造成了毁灭性打击。当欧美领导人、王室成员和精英阶层自身深陷恋童癖丑闻时，他们再也无法站在道德高地指责其他国家的人权状况。美国政府三十多名官员被牵连其中，英国前驻美大使直接向爱泼斯坦泄露国家机密，这不仅动摇了情报网络间的信任基础，更引发了对以色列情报机构可能“劫持”西方世界的担忧。这种道德高地的崩塌，使得西方国家在国际舞台上的公信力面临前所未有的挑战。

then there's the issue of this. I don't know if you saw that very popular image on Twitter for a while about the angle, sex and conservative culture. you probably haven't seen that new image, right? so what impact did this have on America's allies specifically the UK? firstly, there's the Starmer government in the UK, because you know, I actually did a program about this. at the time. this guy, he was the British Ambassador to the US. his name was Peter Mandelson. he could be considered a kingmaker in British politics. similar to the position of Lü Buwei, right? he basically helped install most of the British prime ministers before the Epstein emails were exposed. some people were already questioning him asking why he had such a close relationship with Epstein and why he sent him emails and even taught him how to use Sun Tzu's Art of War to whitewash himself. he resigned because of this incident. and then after these documents were recently exposed, he got even more interesting. firstly, the documents shows that after the two thousand eight financial crisis, he shared government documents in very sensitive details of UK cabinet discussions with Epstein. that's essentially treason, yeah, sharing these confidential government documents with an unrelated wealthy American businessman. and this businessman might even be an asset of an Israeli intelligence agency. you're essentially selling out the UK's national interests right? sharing it with big brother, right? yes, and he shared it with the CIA, but more importantly, he gave Epstein a photo of himself wearing a shirt and underwear standing next to a woman in a jade robe. it looked very unseemly. you know, these British people are very particular. they want to appear very gentlemanly and decent on the surface. but after this photo was exposed, it had a huge impact. perhaps he intended this to be a photo for Epstein, in which case the meaning is quite obvious. he's protecting his own people, right? so this has already had a significant impact on British politics when the information was leaked. in late, twenty twenty five, he was forced to dismiss the ambassador to the US. the prime minister had no choice but to do this. then, on February second of this year, he announced his resignation from the House of Lords and relinquished his peerage title. his political career basically came to a complete end. at the same time, the British police officially launched a criminal investigation into the inappropriate conduct of the official. the main focus of the investigation is whether he leaked classified information, because the email clearly shows that he first told Epstein about this highly confidential government document. then the prime minister was forced to publicly apologize, saying that he was also deceived and misled by Mandelson's lies. Mandelson at the time, said he was misled by Epstein. they were both blaming each other, saying they didn't expect the relationship between these two to be so dark and serious. but you know, once this kind of thing comes out, your opposition will definitely attack you, fiercely. the opposition party said, as a prime minister, how can you be so weak, naive and gullible? you're someone who had frequent contact with a pedophile? and you already knew about this relationship before yet, you still chose him. this shows that you have problems with your personal decisions, and your decision making ability is questionable. at the same time, everyone demanded that the chief of staff be fired because the chief of staff recommended him saying that choosing Mandelson was absolutely no problem. well, anyway, they were just throwing accusations at each other. and we've seen a lot of that. this is actually a major leadership crisis. people will question whether you're incompetent at the same time. there's also someone like George Mitchell, the former US senator and architect of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement, who was disgraced because of the exposure of these details from twenty eleven to twenty thirteen after Epstein had already been convicted, he frequently communicated with him to arrange meetings. as a result, he resigned from his position at his Mitchell Institute, and many public institutions also removed his name from various honorary projects because of the scandal. there are also many accusations against Trump, but we won't go into detail here. we've already discussed that in previous episodes. the Canadian prime minister, however, didn't have extensive communication with Epstein. his name just appeared in the emails many times, mainly because he subscribed to a daily international financial newsletter. it's normal for his name to appear because he was the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada at that time, right? but his role in the London Capital and Financial Scandal investigation was also mentioned, even though he wasn't found guilty in that investigation, that mainly many people are now saying his name also appeared in the Epstein documents. but the investigation into his case was also mentioned. I think this is actually okay for Mark Carney, not not obvious as the others who were arranging meetings or going to his island for parties or something. so I think this is fine, if there wasn't this meeting, it would be okay. but if they meet and went to the island for a party that would be very bad, the most serious cases, the Norwegian royal family, the Norwegian Crown Prince, contacted Epstein and wanted to meet him, wanted to have a party with him. and this has led to the Norwegian, royal family facing a lot of scrutiny. this Crown Prince, he's involved with Epstein every day, and his reputation is definitely not good. meanwhile, the former Norwegian prime minister is under police investigation for serious corruption charges, suspected of accepting gifts, loans and other benefits. this is a very serious accusation. also, the head of the World Economic Forum has been revealed, to have had numerous business dinners with him. he admitted to regretting it, but the World Economic Forum board has officially launched an investigation. so you think that the World Economic Forum board, it's essentially an organization of elites, right? who gets to give presentations and network at the World Economic Forum, there are all elites from various fields. and industries, right. this actually further deepens the distrust of these elites. yes, actually, if we delve a little deeper, it's a matter of identification. we no longer feel that they are part of our group, right? we'll talk about this later. there are also other politicians, such as the former Slovenian Foreign Minister, who served as a national security advisor during the declassification period, he had multiple conversations and meetings with Epstein and text messages revealed him saying, things like the girls in Kyiv are beautiful and Moscow has oil and girls, etc. After saying this, he resigned from his position as security advisor, basically his career in government service ended, there are also other key figures from various committees and platforms connected to Epstein's network. they appear in this document. it seems to be mainly focused on Europe. in America. their circle is basically ruined. the exposure of this incident has many additional implications. on one hand, it essentially creates a crisis for these economic organizations such as the World Economic Forum. because if your leaders and CEOs are extensively involved with such a pedophile and have various private contacts, then isn't your global elite dialogue platform just a global pedophilia dialogue platform. and the key point is that Epstein is very likely connected to, as you just mentioned, the two thousand eight financial crisis, did he really withdraw before the collapse based on his own abilities? or was he given advance information, if that's the case, then wouldn't this economic forum become a forum where global elites collude to exploit ordinary people, right? would still trust you them? yes. so secondly, this has caused immense damage to the West's discourse on human rights. think about it. these European and American leaders and royalty often use the human rights stick to attack other countries, saying things like Russia, you don't have elections or you have elections. but you're a disguised authoritarian regime, a dictatorial state, right? China is also an authoritarian state, and your human rights situation is worrying. you should learn from our Western countries. we write a human rights white paper for you every year. now, I think other countries can write human rights, white papers for these European and American countries too. China has been writing them for a long time. I remember they've been writing them for about twenty years. they've been writing them today. they are not only writing these, but also writing about Epstein. this basically eliminates the moral high ground that they used to have. you're not even on high ground anymore, you're in a ditch. what right? do you have to use human rights to criticize other countries? our government? our American government has over thirty officials involved in the Epstein scandal. all of them, pedophiles, yes. what right? do you have to criticize other countries? the most crucial point is that a former British ambassador to the US directly sent national secrets to Epstein in private messages. how can these intelligence networks trust each other anymore? isn't there also a potential Israeli spy asset here where any information we have actually goes to him? okay, right? it's like Israel has essentially hijacked, the entire so called civilized world, or even the Western world, right? so you can understand why if you criticize Israel on these platforms, you'll face tremendous backlash for small channels like ours. it's not a big deal. but if you're an influential figure, you'll definitely be targeted and attacked. if you're a politician, you'll face a lot of this kind of competition, your opponents will have a lot of funding from groups like AIPAC and they'll.

### 科技与金融巨头的深层牵连

爱泼斯坦档案的泄露，揭示了其与科技、金融界巨头的复杂关系，其中不乏相互指责与利益纠葛。在社交媒体上，**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk）与 **里德·霍夫曼**（Reed Hoffman: LinkedIn联合创始人，知名风险投资家）就爱泼斯坦事件展开激烈交锋。马斯克声称自己为档案的公开付出了巨大努力，并指责霍夫曼多次前往爱泼斯坦的私人岛屿，而自己则拒绝了邀请。霍夫曼则反驳称，他与爱泼斯坦的接触是为了为 **麻省理工学院媒体实验室**（MIT Media Lab: 麻省理工学院著名的跨学科研究实验室，专注于技术、媒体、科学和艺术的融合）筹集资金，并公开了与爱泼斯坦的会面日程以示清白，但承认这是一个错误并表示后悔。值得注意的是，霍夫曼是民主党的主要捐助者，也是共和党的头号敌人，而他曾在马斯克离开后帮助 **OpenAI** 度过转型期，成为其成功的关键推动力。这场争执不仅是个人恩怨，更折射出美国两党间的政治斗争。

**比尔·盖茨**（Bill Gates）与爱泼斯坦的关系也再次浮出水面。此前，爱泼斯坦曾试图敲诈盖茨，邮件草稿中暴露了盖茨与一名俄罗斯女性（被认为是性工作者）的关系，以及他感染性病并试图给妻子下药以治疗的细节。盖茨的前妻 **梅琳达·盖茨**（Melinda Gates）在最近的播客采访中直言，爱泼斯坦案的细节勾起了她婚姻中痛苦的回忆，她曾多次劝告盖茨远离爱泼斯坦，因为他“不是个好人”。梅琳达认为，她与盖茨离婚的一个重要原因就与爱泼斯坦的牵连以及盖茨的婚外情有关。她呼吁盖茨正面回应这些问题，并表示自己离开盖茨是一个“非常正确和明智的选择”，不仅成功分割了财产，也避免了被爱泼斯坦丑闻牵连。

此外，爱泼斯坦档案还揭示了与金融科技领域的重要联系。**彼得·蒂尔**（Peter Thiel: PayPal联合创始人，Palantir创始人，知名风险投资家）的名字在档案中出现的频率位居前列，显示他与爱泼斯坦关系密切。尽管蒂尔是同性恋，对女性可能不感兴趣，但他与爱泼斯坦的联系主要围绕投资展开。蒂尔主要投资的 **Palantir**（一家大数据分析公司，与美国情报机构和国防部门有深度合作）在以色列拥有深厚根基，甚至前以色列总理 **埃胡德·巴拉克**（Ehud Barak）也与Palantir有联系。档案还显示，爱泼斯坦曾代表神秘的 **罗斯柴尔德家族**（Rothschild family: 欧洲著名的金融家族，常被阴谋论提及）联系彼得·蒂尔，声称该家族拥有1600亿美元资产，希望与蒂尔在金融科技领域进行整合。尽管蒂尔拒绝了前往中东的邀请，但表示可以在纽约或爱泼斯坦的岛屿上会面。这一细节让许多人重新审视了关于罗斯柴尔德家族控制全球金融网络的阴谋论，尽管提及不代表证实。

前美国财政部长 **拉里·萨默斯**（Larry Summers）也因爱泼斯坦档案而被迫辞去在斯坦福大学的职务。他与爱泼斯坦曾进行长达3.5小时的录音对话，讨论巴拉克加入Palantir以帮助以色列网络安全公司拓展全球市场。这进一步揭示了Palantir、美国政府情报网络与以色列情报组织之间错综复杂的关系。

I think this is actually okay for Mark Carney, not not obvious as the others who were arranging meetings or going to his island for parties or something. so I think this is fine, if there wasn't this meeting, it would be okay. but if they meet and went to the island for a party that would be very bad, the most serious cases, the Norwegian royal family, the Norwegian Crown Prince, contacted Epstein and wanted to meet him, wanted to have a party with him. and this has led to the Norwegian, royal family facing a lot of scrutiny. this Crown Prince, he's involved with Epstein every day, and his reputation is definitely not good. meanwhile, the former Norwegian prime minister is under police investigation for serious corruption charges, suspected of accepting gifts, loans and other benefits. this is a very serious accusation. also, the head of the World Economic Forum has been revealed, to have had numerous business dinners with him. he admitted to regretting it, but the World Economic Forum board has officially launched an investigation. so you think that the World Economic Forum board, it's essentially an organization of elites, right? who gets to give presentations and network at the World Economic Forum, there are all elites from various fields. and industries, right. this actually further deepens the distrust of these elites. yes, actually, if we delve a little deeper, it's a matter of identification. we no longer feel that they are part of our group, right? we'll talk about this later. there are also other politicians, such as the former Slovenian Foreign Minister, who served as a national security advisor during the declassification period, he had multiple conversations and meetings with Epstein and text messages revealed him saying, things like the girls in Kyiv are beautiful and Moscow has oil and girls, etc. After saying this, he resigned from his position as security advisor, basically his career in government service ended, there are also other key figures from various committees and platforms connected to Epstein's network. they appear in this document. it seems to be mainly focused on Europe. in America. their circle is basically ruined. the exposure of this incident has many additional implications. on one hand, it essentially creates a crisis for these economic organizations such as the World Economic Forum. because if your leaders and CEOs are extensively involved with such a pedophile and have various private contacts, then isn't your global elite dialogue platform just a global pedophilia dialogue platform. and the key point is that Epstein is very likely connected to, as you just mentioned, the two thousand eight financial crisis, did he really withdraw before the collapse based on his own abilities? or was he given advance information, if that's the case, then wouldn't this economic forum become a forum where global elites collude to exploit ordinary people, right? would still trust you them? yes. so secondly, this has caused immense damage to the West's discourse on human rights. think about it. these European and American leaders and royalty often use the human rights stick to attack other countries, saying things like Russia, you don't have elections or you have elections. but you're a disguised authoritarian regime, a dictatorial state, right? China is also an authoritarian state, and your human rights situation is worrying. you should learn from our Western countries. we write a human rights white paper for you every year. now, I think other countries can write human rights, white papers for these European and American countries too. China has been writing them for a long time. I remember they've been writing them for about twenty years. they've been writing them today. they are not only writing these, but also writing about Epstein. this basically eliminates the moral high ground that they used to have. you're not even on high ground anymore, you're in a ditch. what right? do you have to use human rights to criticize other countries? our government? our American government has over thirty officials involved in the Epstein scandal. all of them, pedophiles, yes. what right? do you have to criticize other countries? the most crucial point is that a former British ambassador to the US directly sent national secrets to Epstein in private messages. how can these intelligence networks trust each other anymore? isn't there also a potential Israeli spy asset here where any information we have actually goes to him? okay, right? it's like Israel has essentially hijacked, the entire so called civilized world, or even the Western world, right? so you can understand why if you criticize Israel on these platforms, you'll face tremendous backlash for small channels like ours. it's not a big deal. but if you're an influential figure, you'll definitely be targeted and attacked. if you're a politician, you'll face a lot of this kind of competition, your opponents will have a lot of funding from groups like AIPAC and they'll.

### 学术界良心的考验与情报网络的暗流

爱泼斯坦档案的曝光，不仅震动了政商界，也波及了学术界，甚至揭示了情报机构在幕后的深层运作。令人惊讶的是，著名语言学家、公共知识分子 **诺姆·乔姆斯基**（Noam Chomsky: 美国著名语言学家、哲学家、政治评论家和活动家，被誉为“现代语言学之父”）的名字也出现在档案中。爱泼斯坦曾就如何应对负面媒体关注向乔姆斯基寻求建议，而乔姆斯基的回应（通过第三方转达）则表现出对公众关注性犯罪的轻蔑，称其为“歇斯底里的反应”。乔姆斯基还曾为爱泼斯坦写推荐信，称其为“非常有价值的密友”，并赞扬其“无限的好奇心和深刻的洞察力”。尽管没有证据表明乔姆斯基参与了爱泼斯坦的性犯罪活动，但他与爱泼斯坦的密切往来，以及爱泼斯坦对麻省理工学院（MIT）的捐款，使得这位被视为“学术界良心”的学者晚节不保，声誉受到严重影响。

与乔姆斯基形成鲜明对比的是学者 **诺曼·芬克尔斯坦**（Norman Finkelstein: 美国政治学家、作家，以其对以色列和巴勒斯坦冲突的批判性研究而闻名）。他是这波爱泼斯坦档案泄露中唯一声誉上升的人。当有记者试图撮合他与爱泼斯坦见面时，芬克尔斯坦直接回邮件怒斥：“如果爱泼斯坦把你的15岁女儿置于这种境地，你就不会称他为朋友，而会希望勒死他和德肖维茨！”这里的 **德肖维茨**（Alan Dershowitz: 美国著名刑法教授、律师，曾为爱泼斯坦辩护）正是爱泼斯坦的辩护律师。芬克尔斯坦是一位坚定的反锡安主义（Anti-Zionism）犹太学者，他的家族曾是大屠杀幸存者。他撰写多本书籍，批判以色列政府将大屠杀政治化，使其成为西方国家难以批评以色列行动的“武器”。芬克尔斯坦因其对以色列游说团体在美国政治中影响力的猛烈批评，在学术界付出了沉重代价：尽管他的学术能力和教学水平都得到系和学院的认可，但最终在学校层面，他的终身教职申请被董事会和校长推翻。这主要是由于德肖维茨长期以来对他的诽谤和施压，德肖维茨甚至积极向各大学施压，阻止芬克尔斯坦获得终身教职。

爱泼斯坦案还揭示了情报网络的暗流。爱泼斯坦女友吉斯莱恩·麦克斯韦（Ghislaine Maxwell）的父亲 **罗伯特·麦克斯韦**（Robert Maxwell: 英国媒体大亨，曾被怀疑是摩萨德特工）被普遍认为是摩萨德（Mossad: 以色列情报机构）的重要资产，其离奇死亡（从游艇坠海）被爱泼斯坦的邮件暗示为“被死亡”（was passed away），而非自然死亡，这进一步强化了其因勒索情报机构而“被自杀”的阴谋论。爱泼斯坦本人也被广泛认为是情报机构的“资产”，他利用黑材料控制全球权贵，尤其是与前以色列总理巴拉克等人的关系。档案还显示，爱泼斯坦曾与伊朗前总统 **艾哈迈迪内贾德**（Mahmoud Ahmadinejad）会面，并与美国前白宫首席战略顾问 **史蒂夫·班农**（Steve Bannon）关系密切，甚至接受班农的资助以重塑媒体形象，并资助欧洲民粹主义，试图渗透反建制运动。这表明爱泼斯坦能够超越意识形态界限，构建一个庞大的全球影响力网络。

爱泼斯坦案的本质，是一个系统性的道德腐败网络。他并非孤立的个体，而是整个西方权力核心默认甚至利用的一个“节点”。正如电影《战争之王》（Lord of War）所描绘的军火贩子，爱泼斯坦也是权力结构中的一个工具，其慈善行为不过是洗白手段，而性犯罪则构建了一个“共享犯罪网络”，让所有参与者都沾染污点，从而相互牵制，无人能真正指责他人。下周，美国国会议员将有机会查看未经任何删减的爱泼斯坦文件，届时，更多不为人知的真相或将浮出水面。

then we enter the realm of financial world purges. Jason Stanley, the CEO of Barclays Bank faced very serious accusations. he was implicated in the prosecutors records of proancion's testations, and then there's Katra Cardia Cap who was also forced to resign due to the impact of this incident. you can see that this incident actually exposed something the behind the scenes maneuvering by Epstein and Dershowitz the kind of things that aren't visible on the surface, they systematically targeted these people. so in American academia, if you criticize Israel, you face very serious consequences. but after this wave of documents was released, this scholar Finkelstein saw his reputation soar. everyone said that only this one person's image became more positive. he's the conscience of the Israelis, the conscience of the entire Jewish people. that's the feeling. then you said, okay. I also want to talk about this because we'll discuss it a bit later. look at the Chinese people regarding the large scale massacres committed during Japan's invasion of China, right? but we haven't used this as an excuse to prevent others from criticizing us. we really haven't Israel's use of this approach and its success might be related to the rather aggressive nature of their national character. that's all I can say next is the connection with Iran and Steve Bannon's. European network, you know that Iran and Israel have an irreconcilable hatred for each other, right? both sides want to destroy the other, especially the former Iranian president Ahmadinejad didn't make very shocking anti-Semitic remarks at the time, then the email showed that Epstein and Ahmadinejad met during the latter's time as the Iranian ambassador to the UN in New York and describe Epstein as possessing multi-faceted and perverse political and social skills, able to establish connections with figures like Castro and Ahmadinejad. you can see that Epstein's abilities were indeed quite strong. he was able to transcend ideologies build such a global network of influence. that's very impressive. indeed, of course, the former Israeli prime minister or former president came out to deny it, saying that he had nothing to do with Epstein, otherwise the conservatives in their country would attack him saying, are you colluding with Israel? how do you still have connections with Epstein? where do you still need this spy? quote, they would suspect him of being compromised by an Iranian agent, then we come to a very crucial figure Robert Maxwell. we mentioned this person in a previous live stream. he's the father of Epstein's girlfriend Maxwell. this guy has basically been confirmed to be an Israeli spy. this is further corroborated in the emails exposed by Epstein, because Epstein's emails mentioned Robert Maxwell, it actually quotes an article that says, Robert Maxwell, freed from Mossad, saying that if they didn't provide four hundred million pounds, he would expose all their intelligence activities. subsequently, he died in this email Epstein specifically use the passive voice "was passed away". this means that his passing away wasn't a natural state, but a passive one he was made to die for those familiar with English grammar. you know that this actually implies that the death was not accidental, right? this is a very uncommon, unusual kind of English grammar, right? it's similar to how about ten or fifteen years ago in China, there were often strange incidents like "being suicided", right, "being harmonized". and so on. these strange uses of Chinese often have political implications. so these intelligence analysis experts generally believe that Robert Maxwell, while ostensibly a media mogul was actually an important asset of Mossad. furthermore, his death was highly suspicious. he ultimately died after falling from his yacht into the sea, his body floating on the surface. many believe he was murdered for blackmailing intelligence agencies. you can see that Epstein himself actually believe this conspiracy theory when he forwarded that email his statement about being forced to commit suicide hinted at this essentially reinforcing a widely circulated theory. this ultimately involves a very powerful family. and Peter Thiel in the Epstein documents. you can see that Thiel is ranking third or fourth. I think third, he also had a close relationship with Epstein, and the two often met since Peter Thiel is gay, right? he certainly wouldn't be very interested in women, but whether he's interested in men is another question that's unknown. however, I think his main connection with Epstein was probably centered around investment, because you know, Thiel mainly invested in Palantir. Palantir actually has deep roots in Israel, including the former Israeli prime minister Barak, who also has connections to Palantir. after this email was exposed, it showed that Epstein once represented the Rothschild family. you know, this family, right. there are the core of many conspiracy theories, a very important figure in conspiracy theories. this family is described by many conspiracy theories as secretly controlling the entire global financial network. but coincidentally, this family actually appeared in Epstein's emails, and he even represented this family to contact Peter Thiel, saying that he had one hundred sixty billion assets and could facilitate the integration of finance and technology with Thiel. Thiel, refused the trip to the Middle East, but said they could meet in New York or on Epstein's island. um wow, isn't this Rothschild, the same one that Professor Song Hongbing talked about regarding currency, many people said he was unreliable, calling it a conspiracy theory, but it was indeed mentioned here. however, mentioning it doesn't necessarily mean there's a conspiracy. it's just that they use this name to find Epstein. yes. so Song Hongbing also said that Rothschild doesn't actually control trillions of dollars, but look at his assets, one thousand, six hundred billion. of course, I don't dare say now that the conspiracy theory is definitely wrong because it might be like the AIPAC in Israel, a bellwether, right? you invest in this first than the other tens of trillions follow suit. it's really hard to say. so now facing this, I can only say, oh, my god, Rothschild, that Rothschild, right, yes. at the same time, the party also has a section about Barak, and Larry Summers. everyone knows Larry Summers, right? he was forced to resign from his current position because of the Stanford documents leak. he was the former treasury secretary under Obama or an economist. I forget his exact position. he also had a relationship with a beautiful female Chinese economist, and they had a three point five hour recorded conversation in it. they discuss Barak joining Palantir, the intelligence and defence technology company invested in by Peter Thiel. this helped the Israeli cybersecurity company expand its global market. so you can imagine the deep relationship between Palantir, the Trump administration and US Department of Defense's intelligence network and the Israeli intelligence organization. finally, they're Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for Trump and also Trump's former chief strategist. their relationship with Epstein is extremely deep. I saw a video on Warmzone on the channel that was specifically an interview with Epstein before his death. Bannon was interviewing him at the time, and Bannon actually took money from him to film a series of videos to help Epstein reshape his media image somewhat similar to Epstein's initial goal. in doing this public relations work in the emails you saw concerning his connection with Epstein. many things were mentioned, including the hope that Epstein would fund European populism. moreover, he also wanted to help infiltrate anti establishment movements. it's very ironic because many of his friends are actually from the establishment, the ruling elite. but at the same time, he also transcends political factions. he connects with the establishment, and he also connects with the anti-establishment. he has very deep connections with Trump and Bannon. so you see that the Epstein case reveals a systematic network of moral corruption. he wasn't a one individual. he was actually a node that the entire Western power core tacitly condoned or even exploited. I don't know if you're seen movie. Lord of War, starring Nicolas Cage. I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it. the protagonist in that movie is involved in arms dealing, which I think is somewhat similar to Epstein. he operated a network of arms trafficking, but after he was arrested, the government officials would find a reason to let him go. the most classic scene is at the end when he's called by a very righteous police officer, an Interpol agent who is investigating arms trafficking. he's locked up in a prison and being interrogated. he says everything you're saying is correct. and I don't have any problem with you, but in about half an hour, your superior will come and let me out, because my boss is also your boss, and your boss's boss, and your boss's boss's boss, meaning the US. president, these high ranking people in power. they find it inconvenient to handle certain things themselves. so they delegate the work to me. this time, I was arrested. they might even pay me in the end, everything he said, came true. his superior came first, encouraging the agent, saying you did a good job. catching this person on this project was excellent. okay, you can go now, quote, then they released him and even gave him a suitcase full of money before letting him go. um you've observed very well, don't do that again next time. this is a node tacitly approved or even utilized by the core power network. it's just a tool. the currency of the entire power structure and charity is a tool. white washing. you see Epstein tried to create a philanthropic image for himself. he donated money to MIT and Harvard, right? he donated money to various charitable organizations. but in fact, all of his money came from dirty sources. actually, sex also plays a role here, which is to construct a network of shared criminality where everyone is equally tainted in this way, nobody can accuse anyone else. and finally, the news is that members of Congress will have the opportunity next week to see the documents without any reductions or blocked out sections, then we will be able to see more information.
