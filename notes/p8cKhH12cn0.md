summary: 在特朗普总统第二任期后的首次关键选举中，民主党在纽约市、弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州取得了显著胜利。本次选举揭示了民主党内部温和派与进步派两种截然不同的获胜路径：温和派通过猛烈抨击特朗普的经济政策获胜，而进步派则凭借聚焦民生可负担性问题和变革性议程赢得支持。这些结果被视为对共和党和特朗普的警示，表明选民对经济问题的不满正在转向执政党。同时，选举结果也可能影响联邦政府停摆的谈判，并预示着民主党未来几年在党内路线上的激烈斗争。

### 引言：民主党在关键选举中获胜

《纽约时报》的娜塔莉·基特鲁夫为您播报，这里是《每日》节目。接下来关注选举之夜，这些关键的竞选标志着特朗普总统第二任期的首次选举考验。我们现在可以做出一个重大预测。在弗吉尼亚州，民主党人**阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格**（Abigail Spanberger: 一位温和派女性政治家，曾任**美国中央情报局**（CIA: Central Intelligence Agency: 美国联邦政府主要情报机构之一）官员）将成为首位女州长。**迈基·谢里尔**（Mikey Sherrill: 一位温和派女性政治家，曾任海军飞行员和联邦检察官）将成为新泽西州下一任州长，击败了杰克·切雷利。**美国有线电视新闻网**（CNN: Cable News Network: 美国一家全球性新闻频道）预测，**民主社会主义者**（Democratic Socialist: 一种政治意识形态，主张通过民主手段实现社会主义目标，通常强调社会福利和经济平等）佐兰·姆达尼（Zoran Mdani），这位民主党候选人，将当选纽约市下一任市长。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitroof. This is The Daily. Now to election night in the high stakes races marking the first electoral test of President Trump's second term. We can now make a major projection. In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spamberger will be the first woman to serve as governor. Mike Cheryl is the next governor of New Jersey, defeating Jack Cherelli. CNN projects that Democratic socialist Zoran Mdani, the Democratic candidate, will be elected the next mayor of New York, New York.</p>

昨晚，在特朗普新时代的首次大型选举中，民主党获胜。在新泽西州，伙计们，凭借这次投票，你们应该欢呼雀跃。弗吉尼亚州，我们向全世界传递了一个信息：在2025年，弗吉尼亚州选择了**实用主义**（Pragmatism: 一种注重实际效果和经验的哲学思想）而非**党派偏见**（Partisanship: 对某一政党或事业的强烈支持，常带有偏见）。而在纽约市，今晚你们已经发出了变革的授权，这在全国各地的选票上都得到了体现。所以，唐纳德·特朗普，我知道你正在观看，我有四个字要对你说：把音量调大。今天，全国政治记者**沙恩·戈德马克**（Shane Goldmaker）将解释这些选举告诉我们什么，关于选民对特朗普的看法，以及民主党是否终于站稳了脚跟。今天是11月5日，星期三。

<p class="english-text">Last night, in the first big elections of the new Trump era, Democrats won. In New Jersey, man, with this vote, you guys should scream from the rooftop. Virginia, we sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. And New York City, New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change and up and down the ballot across the country. So, Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you. Turn the volume up. Today, national political correspondent Shane Goldmaker explains what these elections tell us about how voters feel about Trump and whether Democrats have finally found their footing. It's Wednesday, November 5th.</p>

### 2025年选举：对特朗普时代的首次检验

好的，沙恩，在纽约市、弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州，民主党获胜了，从某种程度上说，这并不令人惊讶。这些都是蓝色州和蓝色城市。但竞选结果公布得相当早，我们说的是午夜之前，甚至远早于午夜。我本来还希望能多吃点深夜披萨呢。我们都吃了纸杯蛋糕，所以准备好了。这次**非总统选举年**（Off-year election: 指在美国总统选举年之外举行的选举，通常包括国会中期选举、州长选举、地方选举等）的关键问题是，选民对特朗普的态度是否会比一年前有所软化。这是对总统上任一年后，选民对其执政表现感受的首次**温度检测**（Temperature check: 比喻性说法，指对某种情况或情绪的初步评估或了解）。另一个问题是民主党的表现会如何？那么这些结果告诉了我们什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Did you choose blue M&M's? No, it just like came out. There was extra blue. That's It's very I mean on brand. You did a good job. Okay, so Shane, New York City, Virginia, New Jersey, the Democrats won maybe on one level. Not that surprising. These were all blue states, blue city. But the races were called pretty early. We are talking before midnight. Well before midnight. Well before midnight. I honestly was hoping to have a little more late night pizza. We did both have cupcakes, so we're ready to go. The big question going into this off-year election was would voters soften on Trump from just a year ago. This is the first temperature check on how voters are feeling about the president one year in after everything he's done in office. The other question was how would the Democrats perform? So what do these results tell us?</p>
</details>

### 民主党全面胜利的版图

我认为今年几乎没有哪张选票上看不到对民主党有利的消息。你可以看看主要竞选，弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州的州长选举中，民主党不仅获胜，而且赢得相当大。你可以看看加利福尼亚州重新划分五个**国会选区**（Congressional district: 美国国会众议院选举的地理区域划分）的投票措施，目前也以压倒性优势获胜。你可以看看宾夕法尼亚州的最高法院选举。你甚至可以看看佐治亚州非常靠后的选票，那里的**公共事业委员会**（Public Utilities Commission: 负责监管公用事业（如电力、水、天然气、电信等）的政府机构）选举中，民主党在整个版图上都处于领先地位。在弗吉尼亚州的众议院，民主党目前几乎在所有地方都取得了胜利。所以，这对民主党来说是一个好夜晚，对共和党和特朗普本人来说则是一个糟糕的夜晚。对民主社会主义者来说，这也是一个好夜晚，对吧？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that there's almost nowhere on the ballot that you can look this year that there isn't good news for the Democratic party. You can look at the top of the ticket where there's governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey where the Democrats are not just winning but winning pretty big. You can look at the ballot measure in California to redraw five congressional districts that that's winning overwhelmingly right now. You can look at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. You can look really, really far down the ballot in Georgia where there's a public utilities commission election where Democrats are are ahead really all up and down the map. The House of Delegates in Virginia, Democrats are winning almost everywhere right now. So, this was a good night for Democrats, bad night for Republicans and Trump himself. It was also a good night for Democratic socialists too, right? Yeah.</p>
</details>

### 民主党内部的两条路线：温和派与进步派

我的意思是，我认为获胜的最大人物之一就是纽约市的佐兰·姆达尼。瞧，他赢得这次选举并不令人意外，对吧？他赢得了初选。他一直是民意调查中的领跑者。但如果你在一月份问我谁会在今年十一月获胜，姆达尼根本不在我或几乎任何人的关注范围内。不，他当时根本不在榜单上。是的。他当时只有1%的支持率，在纽约市几乎是个默默无闻的议员，坦白说，在这个城市里没人认识任何议员。但他建立了一个拥有大量追随者的竞选团队，现在显然以34岁的民主社会主义者身份当选市长。是的。我认为这引出了关于这些竞选的第二个，也许是更大的问题：民主党将提出怎样的愿景？民主党是否会围绕一个连贯的自我形象团结起来，为未来指明道路？而今晚有趣的是，我们看到了两种截然不同的民主党人获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think one of the biggest names to win is Zoron Mdani here in New York City. And look, it wasn't a surprise that he won this election, right? He won the primary. Uh he's been the front runner in the polls. But if you would asked me in January who was going to win this November, Mani was not on my or almost anyone's radar. No, he wasn't on the map. Yeah. He was at 1% virtual unknown assembly member in New York in a city where nobody knows any of the assembly members frankly and you know built a campaign that built a huge following and obviously is now the mayor elect as a 34year-old democratic socialist. Yeah. And I think that gets at this second and maybe bigger question around these races which has been what kind of vision were the Democrats going to put forward here? Would the Democrats coales around a coherent version of themselves that presented a path for the future? And what's interesting about tonight is that we saw two very different versions of Democrats win.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我认为我们在新泽西州当选州长迈基·谢里尔和弗吉尼亚州当选州长阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格身上看到了两条不同的道路。她们是拥有国家安全背景的温和派女性，是**中间派**（Centrist: 政治立场介于左翼和右翼之间的人），目标是争取政治选民中的中间力量，对吧？然后在纽约市，你看到一位民主社会主义者，他激励了数千人参加大型集会，并使该市的投票率翻了一番多，比四年前的上一次市长竞选还要高。稍微停留在姆达尼胜利的事实上，其广度和深度，公平地说，即使在像纽约市这样进步的地方，他也做了一些非凡的事情。正如你所说，我们清楚地感觉到投票率是历史性的。超过200万人参加了投票。其中超过一百万人投票给了这个**资本主义**（Capitalism: 一种经济和社会制度，其特点是生产资料私有制，以及以利润为导向的自由市场经济）的首都中的一位民主社会主义者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think we saw two divergent pathways in Mikey Cheryl, who's now the governor- elect of New Jersey, and Abigail Spanberger, the governor-elect of Virginia. moderate women with national security credentials, centrists, aim for the middle of the political electorate, right? And then you have in New York City a Democratic socialist who inspired thousands of people to big rallies and juiced turnout in the city to basically double more than double the last mayor's race just four years ago. just to kind of linger for a moment on the fact of Mamani's victory, the extent of it, the breadth of it, it's fair to say that he did something remarkable even in a place like New York City, progressive New York City. We're getting a pretty clear sense, as you said, that the turnout was historic. Over 2 million people turned out. More than a million of those voted for a democratic socialist in the capital of capitalism.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一次意义重大的选举。我认为它告诉我们很多关于民主党今天的状况，对吧？今天的民主党对民主党**建制派**（Establishment: 指在某个领域或社会中拥有既得利益和权力，并倾向于维持现状的群体）感到不满，对吧？所以，是的，在弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州这样的州，他们选择了更传统的候选人，那些在2018年**中期选举**（Midterm elections: 在美国总统四年任期中间举行的国会选举，也常包括州长和地方选举）中首次获胜的人。但在纽约，他们选择了一个完全不同的人，他的议程几乎是用一种不同的、更具扩张性的语言来表达的。对吧？你知道，自特朗普获胜以来的一年里，民主党选民对民主党确实感到非常沮丧。我认为他的崛起就代表了这种情绪。你知道，这确实是明年我们将在全国各地看到的一种缩影，即民主党**老卫兵**（Old guard: 指某个组织或群体中保守、不愿改变的资深成员）与一群沮丧的**新卫兵**（New guard: 指希望推动变革的新兴力量）之间的斗争，新卫兵希望推动党在议题上采取更大胆、更广泛的立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a huge election. I think it tells you a lot about where the Democratic Party is today, right? The Democratic Party today is unhappy with the Democratic establishment, right? And so, yes, in these states like Virginia and New Jersey, they picked sort of more traditional candidates, people who' first won in the 2018 midterms. But in New York, they they took a a flyer a flyer on somebody totally different who's speaking almost a different language of expansiveness in his agenda. Right? You know, there's a real frustration in the year since Trump won from Democratic voters with the Democratic party. And I think that his rise represents that. You know, it really is that that encapsulation of what I think we're going to see all across the country next year, which is a fight between the old guard of the Democratic Party, age and otherwise, and a frustrated new guard that wants to push the party to take bigger and broader positions on issues.</p>
</details>

### Mdani的胜利：变革性议程的吸引力

那么，让我们深入探讨姆达尼是如何做到的，他是如何成功的。你已经开始谈论一点了，我们在节目中也对此进行了不少报道。他是一位几乎不懈地专注于**可负担性**（Affordability: 指商品或服务的价格对于普通消费者来说是否能够承受）问题的候选人，例如免费公交、租金冻结、免费托儿服务。这显然是一个非常有力的信息。我很好奇，你认为他的胜利有多少是信息本身的力量？还是说，是信息加上这位候选人所带来的一切，即他是一位非常能干的**信息传递者**（Messenger: 在此指能够有效传达信息的人）？我的意思是，这很难说，因为很难将候选人与信息以及信息传递者与信息分开，对吧？我们都知道他所代表的三件事，因为他们传达得非常好，而且反复强调，对吧？许多候选人没有那种信息**纪律性**（Message discipline: 指政治竞选中保持信息一致性和重复性的能力），但他们的信息可能也没有那么广泛和令人难忘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's dig in to how Mamani did it, how he pulled this off. You're starting to talk about it a little bit, and we've we've covered this quite a bit on the show. He was a candidate who almost relentlessly focused on these affordability issues, free buses, rent freezes, free child care. That was clearly a very potent message. And I'm curious, how much of his victory do you think is that message in and of itself? or if it's that message plus everything else that comes with this candidate, which is someone who's a very capable messenger who can deliver that message. I mean, it's so hard to tell because, right, it's hard to separate the candidate from the message and the messenger from the message, right? We all know the three things that he's standing for because they delivered it so well and so repeatedly, right? Many candidates don't have that kind of message. discipline, but then they might not also have a message that's quite as expansive and memorable.</p>
</details>

对吧？在新泽西州竞选的迈基·谢里尔曾多次承诺，上任第一天就宣布公用事业账单进入紧急状态。那是一个成功的讯息，对吧？新泽西州的公用事业账单一直在上涨。这听起来显然是一个经过民意调查验证的成功方案。选民对此感到沮丧。这听起来像是她一生都梦想着竞选州长，只为了上任第一天就宣布公用事业账单紧急状态的事情吗？可能不是。对。对。对。它也不像“冻结租金”那样朗朗上口，你知道吗？不完全是冻结租金，也不完全是免费托儿，对吧？这不会从根本上改变新泽西州作为居住地的面貌，对吧？姆达尼谈论的事情可能会改变，对吧？这些很难实现。他不太可能很快实现全部议程，对吧？但我认为，正是他提出了具有**变革性**（Transformational: 具有改变性质或形态的能力）的想法，才吸引了如此多的关注，并使他成为当下独特的政治人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? Mikey Cheryl running in New Jersey has promised repeatedly to declare on day one a state of emergency for utility bills. That was a winning message, right? The utilities bills have been going up in New Jersey. This is something that sounds clearly like a poll tested winner. Voters are frustrated about that. Does that sound like the kind of thing that she dreamt her whole life of running for governor to declare a day one emergency on utility bills? Like probably not. Right. Right. Right. It also doesn't quite roll off the tongue like freeze the rent, you know? Not quite freeze the rent and not not quite free childare, right? That's not going to change the complexion fundamentally of New Jersey as a place to live, right? The things that mom Donnie is talking about could, right? They are hard. He's unlikely to get that full agenda very quickly, right? But it's the idea that he came up with something transformational that I think that has drawn so much attention to his candidacy and made him sort of a unique figure right now.</p>
</details>

他也代表了民主党内部这个深度**进步派**（Progressive: 政治上主张社会改革和进步的派别）的翼。我的意思是，想想他对加沙问题的表态以及他毫不妥协的亲巴勒斯坦立场，尽管这疏远了一些纽约的犹太人。我的意思是，这感觉像是他在初选中的**门槛问题**（Table stakes: 指在谈判或竞争中必须具备的基本条件或最低要求），但在普选中，这肯定不是他竞选的重点。我认为他确实做出了重大转变，向犹太社区和犹太选民伸出援手，尤其是在**安德鲁·科莫**（Andrew Cuomo: 美国民主党政治家，曾任纽约州州长）在这个问题上猛烈抨击他之后。所以，他并不是回避这个话题，但我认为这更多是他竞选最初的基础，而不是他后来的重点。你是说他没有把这作为竞选的中心。同样，关于特朗普对民主构成威胁的信息也不是。而是他每天都在强调的经济问题和生活成本问题，这确实引起了强烈共鸣。那是他的重点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he was also very much a kind of representative of this deeply progressive wing of the Democratic party. I mean, just thinking about his message on Gaza and his pro Palestine stance that he did not compromise on, even though, you know, there were Jewish New Yorkers who were alienated by it. I mean, this this felt like the table stakes of his candidacy in the primary, it wasn't the emphasis of his campaign, certainly in the general election. I think he did make a big pivot to reach out to the Jewish community and to Jewish voters, especially as Andrew Cuomo hammered him on this issue. So, it wasn't that he ever shied away from the topic, but I think it was less his focus and more the basis of of his campaign at the very beginning. You're saying he didn't make that the centerpiece of his campaign. And neither, right, was a message about Trump being a threat to democracy. It was these economic concerns that he just kept hammering on the cost of living issues that really resonated every single day. That was that was his focus.</p>
</details>

沙恩你提到姆达尼有大约9万名志愿者。我们的同事报道说，他的竞选活动对于参与其中的**Z世代**（Gen Z: 指1990年代末至2010年代初出生的人群）志愿者来说，就像是孤独的解药。他们走出来，为他拉票。他们交了朋友。他们探索了这座城市。他们接触了真实世界。他们走出了家门。他的个性，那种**魅力**（Charisma: 一种超凡的个人特质，能够吸引、影响和激励他人），显然真正激励了人们。也许是那些以前从未投入政治的人。我想知道我们应该给这方面多大的权重。我的意思是，我认为你应该给予这方面很大的权重，对吧？我认为，我们周末报道说，前总统**奥巴马**（Barack Obama: 美国前总统）在选举前给姆达尼打了电话，与他交谈，表示愿意成为他的**智囊团**（Sounding board: 指可以向其提出想法并获得反馈的人或群体），并基本上赞扬了他迄今为止的竞选活动。人们一直在将这两个人进行比较，他们都在民主党选民感到相当黯淡和绝望的时候带来了希望。许多奥巴马时代的**老兵**（Veterans: 在此指经验丰富的老成员）和**校友**（Alumni: 在此指曾为奥巴马竞选或政府工作过的人）都说：“嘿，这是我第一次看到除了奥巴马之外，还有人能像这样激发希望。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned Shane that Mamani had something like 90,000 volunteers. Our our colleagues have reported that his campaign became like an antidote to loneliness for the Gen Z, you know, volunteers who were involved and they came out, they canvased for him. They made friends. They explored this city. They touched grass. They got out there. Like his personality, that charisma, it obviously genuinely inspired people. Maybe people who had never been invested in politics before. And I'm I'm wondering how much weight we should give that. I mean, I think you should give that a lot of weight, right? I think that, you know, we reported over the weekend that former President Obama called Mam Donnie ahead of the election and spoke to him, offered to be a sounding board for him and basically praised the campaign he had just run so far. And people have been drawing parallels between these two men who have brought hope to Democratic voters at a time where they feel pretty bleak and dark. And there's a whole lot of Obama veterans and alumni who have said, "Hey, this is the first time I've actually seen somebody else who's inspiring hope like that."</p>
</details>

这也伴随着巨大的责任。纽约市庞大而复杂，他才34岁，作为立法机构成员管理着一个非常小的团队，竞选团队虽然规模较大，但这仍然是一项艰巨的任务，他必须兑现人们寄予的希望和承诺。否则，这最终将成为左翼的挣扎。他已经成为民主党左翼一个非常重要的人物。不仅仅是他的胜利，而是他能否真正有所作为？即使他能在纽约市取得成功，我认为也存在一个问题：你是否能成为这种类型的民主党人，并在不仅仅是纽约市，而是在州层面，在**摇摆州**（Swing state: 指在美国总统选举中没有明显倾向于民主党或共和党的州，其选举结果往往决定大选走向）的**紫色州**（Purple state: 指民主党和共和党支持率接近的州，选举结果不确定）中，组建一个获胜的联盟。你对此有什么看法？我的意思是，我认为我们现在还不能对此说太多，因为他们还没有尝试过。这就是为什么他正在开辟新天地。这就是为什么这是一次历史性的竞选，对吧？一位民主社会主义者管理一个拥有800万人口的城市是新鲜事，对吧？纽约市比全国许多州都要大。所以，不，我们不知道这在政治上是否可行，但这正是这个项目的全部意义，对吧？也就是说，如果你成功了，就会有人效仿你。如果你没有成功，效仿的人就会更少。那么，你认为民主党最终能从姆达尼的胜利中吸取什么教训呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's a lot of responsibility for that. New York's big and complicated, and he's 34 years old, has managed a very small staff as a member of the legislature, a fairly large campaign team, but this is a daunting thing, and he has to fulfill the hope and promises that people have put. Otherwise, this ultimately is going to be a struggle for the left. He's become this really important figure for the left of the Democratic party. Not just his victory, but can he actually accomplish things? And then even if he is right able to have success in New York City, I think there's a question about whether you can be this kind of Democrat and put together a winning coalition, not just in New York City, but at the state level, you know, at the purple state level in swing state America. What can you say about that? I mean, I don't think we can say much of anything about that yet because they haven't tried. This is why he's plowing new ground. This is why it's a historic candidacy, right? A democratic socialist running a city of 8 million people is new, right? New York City is bigger than a whole bunch of states in the country. And so, no, we don't know whether it's politically viable, but that's the whole idea of the project, right? Which is if you are successful, then there will be people who will emulate you. And if you're not, there will be fewer people. So then what is the lesson do you think that Democrats take from Mani's win at the end of the day?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，最近几周与民主党人谈论姆达尼，完全就像是一次**罗夏测试**（Rorschach test: 一种心理投射测试，受试者通过解释墨迹图案来揭示其内心想法和感受；在此指对同一事物不同人有不同解读）。中间派和温和派看待他的竞选，会说他在可负担性问题上拥有令人羡慕的**信息纪律**（Message discipline: 指政治竞选中保持信息一致性和重复性的能力），这在任何地方都行得通。这种对生活成本的关注是完全正确的，正是该党在2026年要在全国各地、在红色州、紫色州和蓝色州获胜所需要做的。你和左翼人士交谈，他们会说：“当然，他有重点，但这并不是他成功的原因。”他成功的原因在于他提出的解决方案的广度，他能够满足人们对现有体制的沮丧程度，他认为体制已经崩溃，我们需要如此大的解决方案，因为体制已经停止运作。它没有能力解决你的问题，这才是他吸引力的秘密。对吧？不仅仅是他正确诊断了问题。而是他向人们提供了足够大胆的政策解决方案，让他们能够支持。绝对如此。他的支持者会说，这才是他吸引力的真正秘密。

<p class="english-text">I mean talking about Mum Donnie with Democrats has been a total roarshock test in recent weeks. The centrist and moderates look at his candidacy and say like he had an enviable message discipline on the issues of affordability and that can work everywhere. that that focus on the cost of living is exactly right, exactly what the party needs to be doing to win in 2026 all over the country, red states and purple states and blue states. And you talk to people on the left and they say, "Sure, he had a focus, but that's not what made him a success. What made him a success was the scope of the solutions that he was proposing to the problem that he was meeting people with their level of frustration with the system that he was saying is broken that we need such big solutions because the system has stopped working. It's illequipped to handle your problems and that that is the secret to his appeal. Right? It's not just that he was diagnosing the problems correctly. It's that he was offering people policy solutions that were bold enough that they could get behind. Absolutely. That that is what the people around him would say is the actual secret to his appeal.</p>
</details>

### 竞选策略：聚焦民生与反特朗普

当然，他的当选只是我们今晚得到拼图的一部分，因为在一些偏蓝的紫色州，也有重要的竞选，民主党在那里也以一套完全不同的解决方案获胜。对吧？所以，归根结底，在纽约市，这对温和派中间派民主党人来说是一个巨大的损失。但在弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州，温和派民主党人轻松获胜。那么，我们如何理解这一点呢？稍后回来。沙恩，为了理解这些竞选中民主党可以从中学到什么，关于哪种民主党人能以何种信息以及如何获胜，请告诉我这两位女性是如何赢得州长竞选的。她们是如何做到的？让我先说两个词：唐纳德·特朗普，然后给你每个州的一些具体情况。可能没有哪个州比弗吉尼亚州受特朗普及其对联邦政府削减的影响更大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And of course, his election is only one piece of the puzzle that we got tonight because there were places in bluish purple states with big races and you had Democrats win there too with a totally different set of solutions that they were proposing. Right? So bottom line at this moment in New York City, this is a big loss for the moderate centrist Democrat. But in Virginia and New Jersey, moderate Democrats won handily. So, how do we understand that? After the break. Shane, for the purposes of understanding what the lessons are here in these races for Democrats about what kind of Democrat can win with what message and how, tell me about how these two women won their races for governor. How'd they pull it off? Let me start with two words, Donald Trump, and then give you some specifics in each state, which is there's probably no state that has been more impacted by Trump and his cuts to the federal government than Virginia.</p>
</details>

而这正是阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格获胜的地方。她竞选的议题之一是，她对抗的是一位从未获得特朗普支持的共和党对手。然而，她仍然不懈地将那位共和党候选人与特朗普联系起来，让她为特朗普从**狗狗币**（Doge: 一种基于网络迷因的加密货币，常与埃隆·马斯克相关联）时代到最近联邦政府停摆期间的削减政策负责。同时在新泽西州，迈基·谢里尔也同样对抗了一位她不懈地与唐纳德·特朗普联系起来的候选人，并在最近的**联邦政府停摆**（Federal government shutdown: 指美国联邦政府因国会未能通过拨款法案而部分或全部暂停运作）期间获得了巨大推动，当时特朗普威胁新泽西州，特别是那条隧道。这条隧道被称为**门户隧道**（Gateway Tunnel: 连接新泽西州和纽约市的重要铁路隧道项目）。这是一条他们将要建设的新动脉，旨在缓解交通拥堵，一个巨大的基础设施项目。他说：“我将切断那笔资金。”而共和党候选人对此不予批评。

<p class="english-text">And that is where Abigail Spanberger won. And one of the issues she campaigned on, she was running against a Republican opponent who never won Trump's endorsement. And yet she's still relentlessly tied that Republican candidate to Trump, holding her to account for his cutbacks from Doge in the Elon Musk era to the recent cutbacks during the federal shutdown. At the same time in New Jersey, Mikey Cheryl similarly ran against a candidate who she relentlessly tied to Donald Trump and then got a big boost during this recent federal government shutdown when Trump threatened New Jersey and specifically the tunnel. It's known as the Gateway Tunnel that connects New Jersey to New York. This new artery that they're going to build to help with traffic, a huge infrastructure project. He said, "I'm cutting off that funding." And the Republican candidate wouldn't criticize him for it.</p>

她就抓住了这个问题大做文章。所以，不仅仅是特朗普，而是在这些地方具体针对特朗普，并找到一种方式说：“你们需要选举一位民主党人，因为我将反击一位不把你们利益放在心上的总统。”这种**反特朗普**（Running against Trump: 指在竞选中将主要精力放在批评和反对特朗普及其政策上）的策略，民主党一直因此受到批评，对吧？这种观点认为，你必须拥有比仅仅反对特朗普更多的身份和愿景。但在这种情况下，这听起来在这些地方是一个非常有效的信息。我的意思是，我认为答案是，如果没坏，就别修。在这些案例中，在这些州，在当下，反对特朗普是解决问题的最简单、最直接、最好的方式，对吧？你可以通过这样做来获胜。

<p class="english-text">And she pounced all over that issue. And so it wasn't just Trump, it was Trump specifically in these places and finding a way to say, "You need to elect a Democrat because I will push back on a president who doesn't have your interest at heart." This idea of running against Trump, this is something Democrats have been criticized for, right? The idea that, you know, you have to have some more identity and vision than just being against Trump. But in this case, it sounds like it was a very potent message in these places. I mean, I think the answer is that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And in these cases and in these states at this moment, running against Trump was the easiest, simplest, and best way to go about it, right? You can win doing this.</p>

### 选民构成变化：拉丁裔选民的回归

那么，当你深入研究纽约市、弗吉尼亚州和新泽西州所有这些结果的人口统计数据时，它们告诉我们什么？比如，你现在能说出任何有意义的关于特定人群投票方式的信息吗？这与他们去年投票方式有何不同？你说民主党在2024年表现更好。那么是谁改变了立场？如果你想将今晚的结果与一年前新泽西州和弗吉尼亚州几乎每个县的结果进行比较，民主党表现得更好。这告诉你什么？它告诉你，人们正在远离总统。这不仅仅是一个人口群体，而是所有人口群体，对吧？这有点像你一年前在另一个方向上看到的情况。全国各地都是那些红色箭头。你在所有这些县都看到了蓝色箭头。现在，虽然只有两个州，但你在弗吉尼亚州的红色角落和蓝色角落都看到了这种情况。新泽西州的红色区域和蓝色区域。全面。总体而言，民主党比一年前表现得更好。

<p class="english-text">So, when you dig into the demographics of all these results in New York City, in Virginia, and in New Jersey, what do they tell us? Like can you say anything meaningful yet about how specific populations voted? How that's different maybe from how they voted last year? You said Democrats did better than in 2024. So who shifted? If you want to compare the results tonight to the results a year ago in basically every single county in both New Jersey and Virginia, the Democratic Party is doing better. What does that tell you? It tells you that there is a movement away from the president. That's not just one demographic group, but all the demographic groups, right? That's sort of what you saw a year ago in the other direction. All those red arrows across the whole country. You're seeing blue arrows across all of these counties. Now, it's only two states, but you're seeing it in the red corners of Virginia and the blue corners of Virginia. The red pockets of New Jersey and the blue pockets of New Jersey. Across the board. across the board, the Democrats are improving how they did from a year ago.</p>

所以，在上次选举中，特朗普总统在**拉丁裔**（Latino: 指来自拉丁美洲或有拉丁美洲血统的人群）选民中取得了巨大进展。现在，正如你所知，正如你一直在报道的，人们一直在质疑，对**移民及海关执法局**（ICE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国国土安全部下属的执法机构，负责移民执法）突袭的恐惧是否会让他们留在家中，或者对ICE突袭和策略的愤怒是否会促使他们去投票。例如，在新泽西州，这是一个极其重要的投票群体。我们能从这次选举中看出什么关于该社区内部转变的信息吗？他们是永久性地转向右翼，还是并非如此？所以，我花了一些时间在新泽西州拉丁裔人口众多的地区，这是我参加这次选举的核心问题之一。我去的一个地方是**帕塞克县**（Passaic County: 新泽西州的一个县），这个地方连续三次转向支持特朗普，而且特朗普去年以微弱优势赢得了该县。这是你在节目中和我们讨论过的县之一。是的。这是一个位于纽约市郊区的多元化县，在超过95%的选票统计完成后，迈基·谢里尔以15个百分点的优势赢得了该县。那么，你对此有何看法？我无法告诉你具体是哪些人口群体，因为县内有更多元化和较不多元化的小镇。但它确实告诉你，这些拥有多元化人口的地方并没有持续永久性地转向右翼。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, in the last election, President Trump made these huge gains among Latino voters. And now there have been questions, as you know, as you've been covering, about whether fear over ICE raids might keep them home, whether anger over ICE raids and tactics might motivate them to go to the polls. This is a hugely critical voting block in New Jersey, for example. Can we say anything about what this election told us about shifts within that community about whether they are moving to the right for good or maybe not? So, I spent some time in parts of New Jersey with big Latino populations and that's one of my central questions going into this election. And one of the places I went is Paya County, which is a place that has shifted three times consecutively in Trump's direction and that Trump actually won narrowly last year. This is one of the counties you discussed with us on the show. Yeah. This is this is a diverse county just outside of New York City and with more than 95% of the vote in Mikey Cheryl is winning that county by 15 percentage points. And so what do you make of that? I can't tell you which demographic groups cuz there's little towns within the county that are more diverse and less diverse. What it does tell you is that these places that have diverse populations have not continuously permanently shifted to the right.</p>

### 对共和党和特朗普的警示

好的，我想广泛地问一下，特朗普和共和党可能从这些竞选中吸取什么教训。我们已经谈了很多关于民主党的事情。是的，这些是民主党有望获胜的蓝色州，但正如你所解释的，这些结果似乎表明，生活成本问题和担忧确实影响了广泛的人群，甚至包括那些投票给特朗普的人。那么，特朗普和共和党应该有多担心呢？我的意思是，我认为解读选举结果和之前的民意调查，除了将其视为对共和党的**警示**（Warning shot: 比喻性说法，指发出警告以引起注意或促使对方改变行为）之外，别无他法。这表明选民将要求特朗普兑现他修复经济、减缓通货膨胀、降低物价的承诺。而且，不仅在这些州，全国范围内的民意调查也显示，选民越来越不信任特朗普真的专注于这些问题。**全国广播公司**（NBC: National Broadcasting Company: 美国一家主要的电视广播网络）和CNN以及其他民意调查机构的最新调查数据显示，只有大约30%的选民对特朗普在这些问题上的努力感到满意，这是一个非常糟糕的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I want to ask broadly about the lessons that Trump and the Republicans might take from these races. We've talked a lot about the Democrats. Yes, these are blue states where Democrats were favored to win, but as you've explained, these results seem to show that the cost of living issues and concerns are really reaching a broad swath of people. It's something a lot of people care about. people who've voted for Trump. So, how worried should Trump and the Republicans be? I mean, I think that there's not really a way to read the election results and the polls that have led up to them as anything other than a warning shot for the Republican party that Trump's promises to fix the economy, to slow inflation, to lower prices, that voters are going to hold him to those promises. And polls, not just in these states, but nationally leading up to this have shown that voters are increasingly mistrustful that Trump is actually focused on those issues. Really bad numbers in recent surveys from NBC and CNN and other pollsters that show somewhere around 30% of voters are really satisfied with Trump's efforts on these issues.</p>
</details>

从历史上看，经济一直是特朗普的强项。自从他作为《**学徒**》（The Apprentice: 一档由唐纳德·特朗普主持的美国真人秀节目）的前主持人进入政坛以来，多年来人们一直将他视为一位果断的商人，并相信他对经济有很好的把握，对吧？这也是他竞选时的主要卖点。但这并不是他唯一关注的事情，对吧？过去一周我与民主党人交谈过，他们对特朗普无法专注于这个问题几乎是欣喜若狂。相反，他却在白宫追求新的宴会厅，扩建东翼，发布白宫内翻新后的林肯浴室照片，在政府停摆导致福利即将暂停之前，在**海湖庄园**（Mar-a-Lago: 唐纳德·特朗普在佛罗里达州的私人俱乐部和住所）举办了一场盖茨比式的派对，他没有专注于这些一年前为他赢得众多选民的**民生问题**（Bread-and-butter issues: 指与普通民众日常生活息息相关的基本经济问题）。因此，现在这些州获胜的民主党候选人正专注于可负担性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And historically, the economy has been an area of strength for Trump. Ever since he emerged on the political scene as the former host of The Apprentice, people had seen him for years as a decisive businessman and trusted that he had a good sense of the economy, right? And this is what he ran on. But it's not the only thing he's focused on, right? I've talked to Democrats in the last week who have been just sort of almost over the moon with Trump's inability to focus on this issue. and instead his pursuit of a new ballroom at the White House and raising the East Wing, posting photos of the the remodeled Lincoln bathroom in the White House, hosting a Gatsby-esque party at Mara Lago just before benefits are going to be suspended because the government shutdown that he's not focused on these sort of breadandbut issues that brought so many voters to him a year ago. And so now you have Democratic candidates who won in these states focusing on affordability issues.</p>
</details>

特朗普及其经济管理在这些竞选中对共和党造成了相当大的拖累，这非常有趣，因为总统刚刚在**真相社交**（Truth Social: 由唐纳德·特朗普创立的社交媒体平台）上发布了截然相反的信息。他说，我引用他的话：“特朗普不在选票上，以及停摆是共和党今晚输掉选举的两个原因。”你所说的是，实际上他就在选票上，而且这对共和党不利。这是特朗普时代共和党面临的一个根本性挑战，那就是有一整批选民只为唐纳德·特朗普投票。其他共和党人能否让他们出来投票？还是说，特朗普在政治舞台上的存在，除非他是你真正投票的对象，否则只会帮助民主党？这是我在这次选举前的一个问题。我们知道第一任期就是这样，对吧？共和党在他的第一任期内，在**次要选举**（Down-ballot races: 指在同一张选票上，相对于总统或州长等主要职位而言，重要性较低的选举，如地方议员、法官等）中经常失利。这是第二任期的首次考验。最终的利害关系是明年谁将控制国会，以及特朗普的第二任期是会包括共和党四年完全控制，还是只有两年。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Trump and his management of the economy were quite a drag for Republicans in these races, which is really interesting because the president just posted on Truth Social kind of the opposite message. She said, and I'm quoting, "Trump wasn't on the ballot and shutdown were the two reasons that Republicans lost elections tonight." What you're saying is actually he was on the ballot and it wasn't good for Republicans. This is a fundamental challenge for the Republican party in the Trump era, which is that there's a whole set of voters who have only come out for Donald Trump. and can other Republicans go get them out? Or is Trump's presence on the political scene only helping Democrats unless he's the one you actually get to cast your ballot for? This is one of the questions I had going into this election. We knew that was the case in term one, right? Republicans lost down ballot races pretty regularly in his first term. This is the first test in term two. And the stakes are ultimately next year who will control Congress and whether Trump's second term will include complete Republican control for four years or only two years.</p>

### 政府停摆谈判的潜在影响

好的，回到真相社交帖子的另一部分，他说共和党失利的原因之一是政府停摆。这确实让人觉得他认为共和党正在为停摆背锅。我想知道你是否认为情况确实如此，如果是，这是否会影响关于停摆的谈判。从这篇帖子的字面理解来看，情况确实如此。话虽如此，我很久以前就放弃了完全解读特朗普帖子字面意思的尝试。是的，这是徒劳无功的。但我确实认为，今晚的结果无疑将影响关于何时以及如何结束停摆的谈判。我认为这将在明天开始，届时特朗普已安排与共和党议员会面，他似乎至少在一定程度上将今晚的失败归咎于他们。因为如果说我们对关注唐纳德·特朗普和选举失利有什么了解的话，那就是他从不认为这实际上是他的错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, just to return to the other part of that truth social post, he says that one of the reasons that Republicans lost is because of the shutdown. And that does make it seem as though he thinks Republicans are getting blamed for the shutdown. I'm wondering if you think that's the case and if so whether that's going to affect the negotiations over the shutdown. It certainly appears to be the case on a plain reading of this posting. That said, I gave up a long time ago about fully interpreting the plain meaning of Trump's postings. Yes, a fool's errand. But I do think that there's no question that the results tonight are going to impact the negotiations about when and how to end the shutdown. And I think that's going to start tomorrow when Trump is already scheduled to meet with Republican lawmakers who he appears to be blaming at least a bit for the defeats tonight. Because if there's one thing we know about paying attention to Donald Trump and election losses is that he never thinks it's actually his fault.</p>
</details>

你能再多谈谈这些竞选本身可能如何影响关于停摆的谈判吗？因为有一种情况是，民主党可能会说：“好吧，看，我们已经做了我们需要做的事情。我们赢了。人们对停摆感到愤怒。是时候结束这件事了。你们收手吧。我们得到了我们想要的。”是的。我认为那是一种可能。还有另一种可能，他们会坚持立场，认为自己拥有更多筹码，他们看到这篇帖子后会认为，我们需要确保获得非常具体的让步，不仅仅是一次投票，而是一个政策结果。你知道，追踪目前联邦政府历史上最长的停摆事件，最引人注目的一点是，谈判进行得多么少。直到最近几天，我们才开始听到零星的对话，但大多数时候，双方甚至都没有互相交谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you just say more about how the races themselves might impact the negotiations over the shutdown? Because there is a world in which you could see Democrats saying, "Okay, look, we did what we needed to do. We won. People are angry over the shutdown. Time to end this thing. You know, pack it up. We got what we needed." Yeah. I think that that's one world. There's another world where they dig in and think they have more leverage and they see this post and they think we need to make sure we extract very specific concessions, not just a vote, but a policy outcome. You know, one of the most remarkable things about tracking what is now the longest shutdown in federal government history is how little negotiations have been happening. It's really only in recent days where we've started to hear flurries of conversations, but for the most part, the two sides haven't even been talking to each other.</p>
</details>

### 民主党的未来之路：团结与挑战

沙恩，我们开始这次对话时，谈论的是这些竞选告诉我们，在2024年这个真正痛苦的选举年之后，民主党是否真的围绕一个愿景团结起来。尽管这些竞选和候选人确实不同，存在两种不同的路径，一种是温和派，另一种是更具进步性的形象。但总的来说，民主党似乎已经开始围绕一个他们认为能获胜的单一信息团结起来，那就是**可负担性**（Affordability: 指商品或服务的价格对于普通消费者来说是否能够承受）。也就是猛攻这些生活成本问题。无论你是从姆达尼的角度，以那些在纽约引起人们兴奋的强烈共鸣的政策来做，还是在新泽西州和弗吉尼亚州以一种更温和的方式来做，都是在选举中人们最关心的经济问题上猛攻特朗普。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane, we started this conversation talking about what these races told us about whether Democrats had actually coalesed around a vision after this really painful election year in 2024. And while these races were really different and these candidates were different, there were two kind of different pathways here, a moderate and a much more progressive profile. It does sound like in general Democrats have actually begun to coalesce around a single message that they think is winning and that one on this night and that's affordability. that is hammering these cost of living issues. Whether you do it from the Mandani perspective with these very resonant policies that people got excited about in New York or whether you do that in a kind of more moderate way in New Jersey and Virginia, it's hammering Trump on the thing that people care about the most in elections, which is the economy.</p>
</details>

我会这样说。一年前人们对经济不满，他们责怪民主党。现在人们对经济不满，他们责怪共和党。这就是执政党与在野党的区别。所以如果你是民主党人，第一步就是成为反对党，并把人们不满的事情归咎于他们。人们最不满，也一直不满的，就是经济问题。民意调查和这次选举的结果表明，他们在经济问题上愿意给共和党的**容忍度**（Amount of rope: 比喻性说法，指给予某人犯错或失败的机会，或在一定程度上容忍其行为）正在耗尽。话虽如此，在经济问题上反对特朗普可能足以在2026年赢得众议院，但如果他们真的想夺回权力，还有更重要的事情要做。要赢得参议院，你必须在特朗普仍然相当受欢迎的州获胜。你将不得不提出一个更大、更广泛的信息。最终，如果你想在2028年赢得总统职位，你需要有自己的信息。也许是姆达尼的启发和斯潘伯格、谢里尔的温和策略的某种结合。我们还不知道那会是什么样子。坦率地说，这将是民主党未来几年的一场巨大斗争。但我们现在知道的是，在沉寂了一年之后，民主党一直渴望一战。我认为周二的选举是他们在这场斗争中打出的第一记真正的重拳。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I would put it this way. People were unhappy about the economy a year ago and they blamed Democrats. People are unhappy about the economy now and they're blaming Republicans. This is the difference about being the party in power. And so if you're Democrat, step one is being the opposition party and blaming them for things that they're unhappy about. And the number one thing people are unhappy about and have been unhappy about is economic issues. And polls show and the results of this election suggest that the amount of rope that they're willing to give the Republicans on this issue is running out. That said, it might be enough to oppose Trump on economic matters to win the House in 2026, but there are bigger fish to fry if they really want to take back power. To win the Senate, you're going to have to win states where Trump is still pretty popular. And you're going to have to come up with a bigger and broader message. And eventually, if you want to win the presidency in 2028, you're going to need a message of your own. And maybe it's some combination of the inspiration from mom Donnie and the moderation from Spanberger and Cheryl. We don't know what that looks like yet. And frankly, that's going to be the huge fight of the Democratic Party in the coming years. But what we know right now is that after a year of being on the mat, the Democratic Party has been desperate for a fight. And I think the elections on Tuesday are the first real punch that they've landed in that fight.</p>

### 附录：迪克·切尼逝世

非常感谢你，沙恩。谢谢。我们马上回来。以下是您今天还应该了解的其他信息。**迪克·切尼**（Dick Cheney: 美国共和党政治家，曾任美国副总统），被广泛认为是美国历史上最有权势的副总统，在恐怖主义、战争和经济变革时代是一位独特的人物，于周一去世。作为**乔治·W·布什**（George W. Bush: 美国前总统）政府的副总统，切尼是“9·11”袭击后政府**反恐战争**（War on Terror: 美国在“9·11”袭击后发起的全球军事和政治行动，旨在打击国际恐怖主义）的关键策划者。他协助促成了**《爱国者法案》**（Patriot Act: 2001年美国通过的一项法律，旨在扩大政府在反恐方面的监控和调查权力）的通过，该法案扩大了政府的监控权力；他也是布什总统在2003年决定入侵伊拉克并随后为这场战争辩护的主要支持者。近年来，切尼谴责特朗普总统，称他严重威胁美国民主。2024年，切尼宣布他将在总统选举中投票给副总统**卡玛拉·哈里斯**（Kamala Harris: 美国民主党政治家，现任美国副总统），这让两党都感到惊讶。

<p class="english-text">Thank you so much, Shane. Thank you. We'll be right back. Here's what else you should know today. Dick Cheney, who was widely regarded as the most powerful vice president in American history and a singular figure in an era of terrorism, war, and economic change died on Monday. As vice president under George W. Bush, Cheney was a key architect of the administration's war on terror in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He helped engineer the passage of the Patriot Act, which expanded the government's powers of surveillance, and he was a dominant voice behind President Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, and then to justify that war. In recent years, Cheney denounced President Trump, saying he was a grave threat to American democracy. And in 2024, Cheney surprised both parties by announcing that he would vote for Vice President Kala Harris in the presidential election.</p>
