### 作者背景：从葡萄酒评论家到硅谷哲人传记作者

**Amit:** 大家好，欢迎回到频道。今天我请到了一位非常特别的嘉宾，迈克尔·斯坦伯格（Michael Steinberger），来讨论他的新书《硅谷哲人》。迈克尔，感谢你的到来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to the channel. I'm here today with a very very special guest here with Michael Steinberger to discuss the philosopher in the valley, his latest book. Michael, thanks for being here.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 很高兴能和你交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: It's a pleasure to be with you.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 这将会是一场非常激动人心的对话，因为我一直是 **Palantir**（Palantir Technologies: 一家专注于大数据分析的美国软件公司，以其为政府和商业客户提供的平台而闻名）的粉丝，长期以来都对这家公司很感兴趣。我的很多观众显然也很关心这家公司。它已经发展出了一个相当庞大的散户股东基础。而你基本上写了一本关于卡普（Karp）生平的书，同时也讲述了 Palantir 的故事。所以我认为，关于这本书是如何诞生的，以及你为什么选择写这个主题，有很多不同的细微之处可以探讨。我想从这个问题开始，以便让谈话顺利进行。你从 2002 年到 2011 年曾担任网络杂志《Slate》的葡萄酒专栏作家。

关于葡萄酒，有趣的一点是，我不是一个嗜好葡萄酒的人，但从我那些喝葡萄酒的朋友那里了解到，人们在品酒、分析、闻香时有一种特定的精神层面的方式，葡萄酒这个概念充满了各种细微的差别。你写的这本书是关于一个非常神秘的人，可以说，要理解这位“硅谷哲人”亚历克斯·卡普（Alex Karp），需要进行大量的心理分析。你认为你写了十年葡萄酒评论的经历，是否影响了你写作亚历克斯·卡普的方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: This is going to be a really exciting conversation because I have been a fan of Palantir for a long time. I've been intrigued by the company. A lot of my audience has obviously cared about the company. The company's developed a pretty significant retail shareholder base and you essentially did a book on the life of Karp but also the story of Palantir and so I think there's a lot of different nuances to get into in terms of how this book even came to be and and why you chose to write about this subject. I want to start with this question to get things rolling. You served as a wine columnist for the internet magazine Slate from 2002 to 2011. And the interesting thing about wine, I'm not the biggest wine drinker, but from my friends who do drink wine, there's a certain spiritual way that people like to drink and analyze and smell and there's all this nuance to the concept of wine. You wrote a book about someone who is very enigmatic and one could argue there's a lot of psychoanalysis that comes to understand the philosopher in the valley that is Alex Karp. Do you think your 10 years of writing about wine kind of influenced how you approached writing about Alex Karp?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 这是个好问题，我其实没想过这一点。有趣的是，他经常提起我写葡萄酒评论的背景。事实上，他曾指出，这就像谈论……他会提到一种葡萄，然后说，即使你不喜欢这种特定的葡萄，你似乎也能相当公正地去写它。我曾经写过一篇文章表达我对长相思（Sauvignon Blanc）的鄙视。我不认为长相思的爱好者会觉得那篇文章特别公正。但不管怎样，卡普认为我能够以一种不偏不倚的态度来写作，把我的个人感情放在一边。至于写葡萄酒是否为写这本书做了很好的准备，也许吧。葡萄酒是一个复杂的主题，有很多维度。你处理的是一个人们有强烈情感的领域，这关乎个人品味。

也许在某种我没有完全理解的方式上，这确实为写作像卡普这样复杂和与众不同的人做好了准备。他在全球商界是独树一帜的，他身上有许多维度，这在其他更标准的 CEO 身上或许找不到。所以，我想这其中可能有些道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: It's a great question and I hadn't actually thought of that. It's interesting. He brings up my background with wine writing quite often. In fact, he says, he's made points that, it's just like, talking about, he'll reference, he'll say a grape, and he said, if you don't like, even if you don't like this particular grape, you seem able to write about it quite fairly. And I once wrote a piece expressing my disdain for Sauvignon Blanc. I don't think Sauvignon Blanc fans would think that piece was particularly fair. But nevertheless, Karp thought I was able to write about things with with a certain even-handedness, putting my feelings aside. As for whether writing about wine was good preparation for this, maybe. I mean, wine is a complicated subject. There are a lot of dimensions to it. You're also dealing with something where people have strong feelings. It's a matter of matters of personal taste. And maybe in some some way that I didn't quite understand, there was decent preparation for for writing about someone as complex and different as Karp. He is something different on the global business scene and there are dimensions to him that you perhaps don't find in other more standard issue CEOs. So I think there's something to it.</p>

### 奇特的校友关系与书的缘起

**Amit:** 是的，我认为很多散户投资者之所以对卡普感兴趣，就是因为他这个人很有趣，即使在公司股价表现不佳的时候也是如此。很多人喜欢听他说话。你书中的一个主旨是，你注意到卡普有一种让别人听他说话的能力，即使他们并不同意他的观点。我认为这是任何领导者最难建立的能力之一——让人们关心他们要说的话，因为它迫使人们产生一种“嘿，这个人很重要，也许我们应该认真对待他”的感觉。在商界，这可能意味着数十亿甚至数百亿美元的收入。让我们谈谈你和卡普最初是如何认识的。我认为书中的一个主要角色是**哈弗福德学院**（Haverford College: 位于宾夕法尼亚州的一所著名小型文理学院），你们俩实际上是同班同学。那里只有大约 1500 名学生，但你们直到几十年后才重新联系上。你能讲讲你们是如何认识的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. I mean, I think one of the reasons why a lot of retail investors became intrigued with Karp is because of how interesting he was, even when the company stock price was not performing. A lot of people like to listen to what he had to say. And one of the sort of major themes in your book is that you noticed Karp has a way to get other people to listen to him even if they don't agree with him. And that I think is one of the, the hardest things for any leader to be able to establish the ability to get people to care about what they have to say because it forces some level of, hey, this person matters. Maybe we should take them seriously. In the business world, you know, that could result in potentially billions and billions of dollars of revenue. Let's get into how you and Karp originally met. So, one of the main characters I would say of the book is Haverford College where you both actually went to the same class. There's only about 1500 students there, but you didn't end up reconnecting until decades later. Can you kind of tell the story of how you got to know him?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 事情比这更夸张。我们都在费城郊外的这所小型文理学院上学。一个年级不到 400 人。我们在那里待了四年，却从未说过一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, it's it's even more than that. We went to this small liberal arts school outside of Philadelphia. Um, you know, so, you know, class size of fewer than 400 people. We spent four years there and never once exchanged a word.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Wow.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 这本身就是一种成就。我完全不知道这是怎么发生的。我想他，他总是轻描淡写自己在那里的努力程度，但我认为他工作得相当努力。我敢肯定，图书馆见到他的次数比见到我的次数多，这或许在某种程度上解释了为什么他最终成了亿万富翁而我没有。

但这很奇怪，因为比如说，我的妻子去了布林茅尔学院（Bryn Mawr College），而哈弗福德和布林茅尔关系非常密切，就像兄弟姐妹学校一样。哈弗福德是完全男女同校的，它在 1980 年，也就是我们入学前几年，就完全实现了男女同校。

它们仍然保持着非常密切的联系。我妻子认识他。我们有共同的朋友。但不知何故，我和他就是从未有过交集，从未在那里说过一句话。

时间快进到这么多年后，我开始知道 Palantir 这家公司，也知道了它的 CEO，哦，他是我在哈弗福德的同班同学。真有意思。如果我说当我看到他的照片时，我想起了“哦，我记得那家伙”，那我就是在撒谎，因为事实并非如此。总之，我后来成了《纽约时报杂志》的撰稿人。我不再写葡萄酒，开始为《纽约时-报杂志》写一些非葡萄酒主题的文章。当时我认为 Palantir 会是一个非常引人入胜的故事。很重要的一点是，我们之前没有任何关系，因为杂志社是不会委派这个任务的，那会构成利益冲突。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: That's that's a kind of achievement in itself. I have no idea how that happened. I think he was, he downplays how hard he worked there, but I think he worked pretty hard. I am quite certain the library saw more of him than it saw of me, which perhaps goes some way to explaining how he ended up a billionaire and I didn't. But it's very strange because for instance my wife went to Bryn Mawr College and Haverford and Bryn Mawr are very close. They're like brother and sister school. Haverford's fully co-ed. It turned it went fully co-ed in 1980. So a few years before we got there. They still keep very close ties. My wife knew him. We had mutual friends. Somehow he and I just never connected, never exchanged a word there. And so cut to all these years later. I had become aware of Palantir and had become aware of its CEO and oh he was in my class at Haverford. Interesting. And if I'd be lying if I said when I saw pictures of him that I was like oh I remember that guy because that's just not true. Anyway, so I had become a writer for the New York Times magazine. I had moved on from wine and started writing about non-wine subjects for the New York Times magazine. And I thought Palantir would be a really compelling story and it's important that we did not have any prior relationship because the magazine would not have assigned it because that would have been a conflict of interest.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Right.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我们在 2019 年第一次见面，是一次非正式的谈话，他当时在打量我，决定是否要为一篇杂志特稿提供合作。我们聊了聊那些我们从未共同经历过的旧时光。从那以后，他同意为杂志的故事提供合作。我在 2019 年到 2020 年期间报道了这个故事。文章发表于 2020 年，就在 Palantir 上市几周后。

那是一篇相当全面的文章，有 9000 字，篇幅很长。但尽管如此全面，我感觉还有很多话要说。在报道那个故事期间，我花了很多时间和他在一起，对他非常着迷。我认为他的故事和 Palantir 的故事还有更多值得挖掘的地方。所以，文章发表大约一年后，我跟他谈了写一本书的可能性。我认为关于 Palantir，有一本既及时又重要的书值得去写。我到他在新罕布什尔州的住处去见他，我们谈了这件事，他同意了。所以整件事就是这样发生的。他同意合作。

是的，我认为他同意合作有几个不同的原因。那时他想，关于 Palantir 的书迟早会有人写，他认为与一位作家合作是明智的。他觉得《纽约时-报杂志》那篇报道很公正，很好地捕捉到了他是谁以及他如何看待这个世界。所以，与一个他曾经合作过的人再次合作是合理的。我认为另一个让他对写书感兴趣的因素是，他已经把公司带上市了，Palantir 是一个成功的故事，他希望被认可为那份成功背后的驱动力。因为，作为一个像你一样密切关注这家公司的人，你知道，即使到今天，你仍然会看到很多文章的标题是“彼得·蒂尔的 Palantir”。这简直就像是，在特朗普第一届总统任期内，这几乎成了一种习惯，几乎每篇文章都写着“蒂尔的 Palantir”，尽管彼得从未参与过 Palantir 的日常运作。他是董事会主席，但真正经营公司的是亚历克斯，是卡普。我想他希望……那并不是卡普怨恨的来源，但我认为他希望被认可为那个将这家公司打造成成功故事的人。他想要一点主角光环。关于他的过去有很多可以深入探讨的地方，但从宏观层面来看，你认为除了他是 CEO、负责公司日常运营这些显而易见的原因外，为什么卡普希望被认可为那个“主角”？有没有更深层次的原因，让他想被看作是那个人？因为现在，他客观上就是那个人了。

<p class="english-text">Michael: We met for the first time in 2019, an off-the-record conversation just where he was kind of sizing me up and deciding whether he wanted to cooperate on a magazine feature. And we reminisced a bit about old times we never shared and from that, he agreed to cooperate on the story for the magazine and I reported that story through 2019 and into 2020. It appeared in, it was published in 2020, a few weeks after Palantir went public, right? And then, it was a pretty comprehensive article. It was 9,000 words, which is a lot of words. But as comprehensive as it was, it felt like there was still a lot more to say. I had spent a lot of time with him reporting the story, was very intrigued by him. I thought there was more to his story and more to the Palantir story. And so about a year after the article came out, I talked to him about the possibility of doing a book. I thought there was a timely and important book to be written about Palantir and went up to see him at his place in New Hampshire and we talked about it and he was on board with it. So that's kind of how this whole thing happened. And he agreed to cooperate and I think he cooperated for a couple different reasons. He assumed at that point that a book would be written about Palantir and he thought it made sense to cooperate with a writer. He thought the Times magazine story was fair. He thought it would do a good job of capturing who he was and how he thought about the world. So it made sense to cooperate with someone he had worked with before and I think the other factor that interested him in having a book written was because look at he taken the company public and Palantir was a success story and he wanted to be recognized as the driving force behind that success because as you know as someone who's followed the company as closely as you have you know even to this day you see a lot of articles the headline in stories about Palantir was Peter Thiel's Palantir and that was absolutely just like it was almost like a tick during the first Trump presidency almost every article was Thiel's Palantir even though Peter never had any involvement with the day-to-day workings of Palantir. He was chairman of the board but it was Alex it was Karp who was running the company and I think he wanted it was that wasn't a source of resentment for Karp but I think he wanted to be recognized as the person who had made this who built this company into the success story that it had become. He wanted a bit of the main character energy. There's a lot to dive into in terms of his past life but at a high level why do you think Karp wanted to be recognized as the main character outside of the obvious you know he's the CEO he's responsible for the company actually getting to where it is on a day but was there something deeper for why he wanted to be seen as that guy because now he objectively is that guy.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 是的，是的。不，我认为是这样。听着，当你处在这样的位置时，你不可能缺乏自尊。我认为，将这家公司上市，并成功公开募股，是一件非常非常大的事，而且花了很长时间才走到这一步。我想，纯粹地，我不想说这是自负，但我认为他希望自己的成功得到承认。

他觉得，他通往硅谷的道路是一条非常不可能的道路。所以，我想他肯定认识到自己有一个非常有趣的故事。

而且，在某些方面，Palantir 本身就是一个非常不可能的成功故事。

所以我认为他只是渴望看到这个故事被讲述出来。他知道总有一天会有人以书的形式来讲述这个故事。于是，我恰好出现在他新罕布什尔州的家门口，说：“嘿，我想接手这件事。”他考虑了一下，然后同意合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think it's Yeah. Listen, you can't be lacking in self-regard when you are in a position like this and and I think certainly taking this company public having a successful public listing was a huge huge thing and then and it had taken a long time to get to that point and and I think just pure and I don't want to say it's ego but I think he wanted to be have his success acknowledged. He felt that there was, his path to Silicon Valley was an very improbable one. So I think, he recognized certainly that he had a very interesting story and and Palantir was just a very unlikely success in some ways. And so I think he just was eager to see that story told. He knew it was going to be told, in book form by someone at some time. And so I happened to show up on his doorstep in, in New Hampshire and said, "Hey, I would like to to take this on and and he thought about it and then and and agreed to cooperate."</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 你认为如果你们不是校友，他还会合作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Do you think if you guys didn't go to the same school, he would have he would have not cooperated?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 这是个好问题。嗯，听着，我认为哈弗福德的这层关系……他们在 2019 年的时候并没有做太多媒体宣传。所以我想，哈弗福德的关系——我不能确定这绝对是事实——但我认为这层关系让他足够感兴趣，以至于他愿意和我见个面，讨论我为杂志社想做的那个报道。我认为哈弗福德的关系在这方面起了作用。但我不认为这和写书有什么关系，尽管哈弗福德在书中占有非常重要的位置，原因可能哈弗福德本身并不完全喜欢。但我认为，这和书本身关系不大，但可能与他愿意考虑为《纽约时-报杂志》的报道提供合作有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: That's a good question. Um, you know, I think, um, listen, I think the Haverford connection, um, they they weren't doing a lot of press back in 2019. Um, so I think you know the Haverford connection I don't know this to be I don't know this is absolutely the case but I think the H connection intrigued him enough that he was willing to take a meeting with me to discuss about whether he want the story I was interested in doing for the magazine. I think the Haverford connection helped in that regard. Um I don't think it had anything to do with the book. Um though Haverford figures very prominently in the book for reasons that Haverford may not entirely love but I think um I I don't think it had much to do with the book but it may have had something to do with his willingness to entertain the possibility of cooperating on the Times magazine story.</p>
</details>

### 卡普的成长岁月：混血身份与阅读障碍

**Amit:** 好的。那么，让我们更深入地探讨一下亚历克斯·卡普和他早年的生活，然后再谈到他转向 Palantir 的过程。书中你重点突出了两个元素，一个是他的混血身份，另一个是他的学习障碍，也就是**阅读障碍**（Dyslexia: 一种常见的学习障碍，主要特征是尽管拥有正常的智力，但在阅读、拼写和书写方面存在困难）。我想先从混血身份开始，然后再谈阅读障碍。我接触过的 Palantir 社区里，很多人甚至不知道卡普有一半黑人血统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Right. Okay. So let's uh let's dive deeper into Alex Karp and his early life and uh then we'll get into the transition to Palantir. So, there's two elements of the book that you highlighted pretty well, which was his biracial identity and his learning disability, which was dyslexia. I want to start with the biracial identity, and then we'll work our way towards the dyslexia. Uh, a lot of people in the Palantir community that I speak to don't even know that Karp is half black.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 他们中很多人甚至不知道他是犹太人。所以，跨种族身份本身就有很多细微的差别。然后在此之上，又从宗教角度加入了犹太人的成分。你对卡普如何看待自己的混血身份有何看法？你认为这种身份在他的职业生涯中是推动了他，还是给他带来了不利？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Many of them don't even know he's Jewish. And so, like, there's a variety of nuance to the to the to the to the concept of being interracial in and of itself. So, and then and then on top of that, you know, adding the Jewish component to it from a religious perspective. What is your perspective on how Karp thought of himself being biracial? And how do you think that identity either propelled him or provided him a disadvantage over the course of his career?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我会这么说。我认为，他很早就明白，身为混血、身为犹太人、患有严重的阅读障碍，这些在生活中都不是优势。这些都是对他的不利因素。种族主义当然是一个因素，尽管他说他从未亲身经历过种族主义。但他肯定知道这是美国生活中的一个主要因素，也是他所生活的世界的一部分。当然，反犹主义在整个历史上也一直是一股重要的力量。所以他很早就明白，在他看来，自己有一些不利条件。我想说，对于 Palantir，你必须理解他的一点，这一点可能在电视上或他的公开言论中没有表现出来，那就是他从小就有一种脆弱感，因为他的身份。他并不认为这是一种负担，只是明白种族主义、反犹主义是生活中的因素，是他可能在生活中面临的事情。我认为这种脆弱感一直伴随着他直到今天。对于 Palantir，我确实认为，他参与这家公司、并带领它走向成功的动机之一，在某种意义上，是在他心目中为亚历克斯·卡普创造一个更安全的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: You know, I would say this. I think, you know, I think, yeah, he understood early on that, you know, being biracial, being Jewish, being severely dyslexic, um, were not advantages in life. That's, you know, there were strikes against him. Um, you know, racism was certainly a factor. though he never he says he never experienced racism itself. He he he certainly knew that it was a a major factor in American life and just you know just part of the you know the world in which he lived and certainly um anti-semitism was a was a a significant for has been a significant force throughout history. So he kind of understood early on that he had some strikes against him as he perceived it and and and um I would say you know that um you know with Palantir um you know I think the thing you have to understand with him and and and and maybe it doesn't come across when it's on television or in his public pronouncements but I think he's had a sense of vulnerability from a quite young age um because of his identity um didn't consider burden but just understood that you know um you know racism anti-semitism were factors in in life were were were things he might face in life and I think there was a sense of vulnerability that has stuck with him to the present day and and you know with you know with Palantir I do think part of the motivation for getting involved with this company for for seeing this company through to the success was in some sense he was making the world safe for Alex Karp in his mind,</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Right?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我认为这是一个……现在说一个身家数十亿、有庞大安保团队的人，会觉得有点奇怪。他有什么好怕的？但我认为那种脆弱感一直伴随着他。它推动了 Palantir 的许多决策，那种他一直以来都怀有的恐惧。所以，我想，这或许是思考他的混血背景和身份的一种方式，即这与 Palantir 的成长是密不可分的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: I think that is a you know and and then you know it's a it's a it's a strange thing to say now about a guy who you know is a multi-billionaire has a big security detail. It's like what does he have to fear? But I think that sense of vulnerability has stuck with him. um it propels a lot of the decision, you know, a lot of the decision-making of Palantir, the fear that sort of, you know, that that he has always that he's always had and and you know, so I think, you know, this is, you know, this is kind of the way, you know, one might think about, you know, his his biracial background and his, you know, his identity that, you know, it is it is integral to what Palantir became in a sense.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 书中有一段引述，卡普对他的兄弟说，他（兄弟）更关注家庭的黑人血统，而卡普则较少关注。你认为卡普为什么较少关注这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: There is a quote in the book uh from Karp saying to his brother that he focused more on the the the family's blackness and Karp focused less on it. Why do you think Karp focused less on it?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 这是个很好的问题。他的兄弟给了我很多时间，非常慷慨地分享了他的时间、想法和回忆，并且详细地讲述了家族历史。他说，在高中和大学时期，以及大学的朋友们——那些在哈弗福德认识他的人，不像我——都证实了这一点，他非常认同自己的黑人传统。他的兄弟说，在高中时，他是一个年轻的黑人男性，这种情况一直持续到哈弗福德。他非常积极地参与那里的黑人学生组织。事实上，我们大四那年，他帮助组织了一场在耶鲁大学举行的反种族主义会议，并且在《底特律自由报》的一篇关于大学校园种族主义的大篇幅报道中被引述，谈论种族主义是多么普遍等等。

所以，有趣的是，他到了 Palantir 之后，直到公司成立很多年后，他才告诉公司里的任何人他母亲是黑人。

正如你所说，他在某个时候对他的兄弟说，这已经是他在 Palantir 取得成功很久之后了，他们有一次谈话，他对兄弟说：“你把黑人身份调高了，而我把它调低了。”我在书中没有对为什么会这样做出任何推测。我真的觉得，因为这是一个相当敏感的领域，涉及到身份认同以及你如何看待这些事情。我非常满足于将这些信息放在那里，让读者自己得出结论。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Michael: It's a great question. Now, you know, as a his brother um who gave me a lot of time was very very generous with his time and and and his thoughts and his recollections and and and you know, really, you know, laid out the family history. Um you he said that in high school and in college and and college friends um people at Haverford who knew him unlike me um substantiated this you know he very much identified with his black heritage. Um you know his brother said in high school he was a young black man and and that continued through Haverford. He was you know very involved with black student organization there. Um, in fact, um, our senior year, he helped organize an anti-racism conference that was held at Yale University, I believe, um, and was quoted in in the Detroit Free Press, which did a big, um, article not long thereafter about racism on college campuses, and he's talking about how prevalent racism is and and so forth. So, you know, um it is interesting that, you know, he gets to Palantir and it's not until many years after the company started that he told anyone at the company that his mother was black. And as you said, I mean, he tells his brother at, you know, some point, you know, this is, you know, well into, you know, he's now with Palantir Company success and they have a conversation and then, you know, he said to his brother, you you know, you've you've dialed up the blackness and I've dialed it back. Um I did not I I did not I do not offer any speculation in the book about why that is. Um you know I I really felt you know because this is you know this is kind of fraught uh terrain. Um you know it's matters of identity and and how you think about these things and and you know I was very content to put this information in there and to let the reader draw his or her own conclusion.</p>

**Amit:** 我确实认为书中有个部分，卡普在你们的对话中提到，他没有经历过一个百分之百的黑人男性所经历的那种痛苦。这其中有很多细微的差别，涉及到世界如何看待卡普，或者世界如何不看待卡普。最重要的是，根据卡普这些年的演变，尽管我认为这一点从他还是学生时就相当真实了，他更关心的是精英主义，而不是那种多元化、公平和包容的观点。你认为是否因为这个原因，他不想因为自己的黑人身份而被区别对待，无论是更好还是更坏，所以他专注于成为最好的自己，而不是成为“黑人中最好的”？

<p class="english-text">Amit: Well, I do think there is one part of the book where Karp mentions to you in in your conversations that he is not going through the same types of pain that a full 100% you could say black man is going through, not biracial. Uh, and there's a lot of different nuance to that just in terms of how the world perceives Karp or how the world doesn't perceive Karp. And on top of that, I mean, based on how Karp has evolved over the years, even though I think this has been pretty true since since he was a a a student, uh, meritocracy is what he cares about a lot more than the sort of diversity, equity, inclusion standpoint. Do you think because of that he didn't want to be treated as someone better or worse because of his blackness, which is why he focused on just being the best versus being the black best?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，他觉得，他不会被黑人社区接纳为他们的一员。我认为这是一个问题。而且他的经历也不同。他说他从未感受到种族主义的刺痛。是的。所以如果他声称自己有过那种经历，或者他经历的生活和其他黑人一样，那对他来说就是欺骗。他说那不是他的经历，他也没有以任何方式否认他的黑人传统。他说他为此感到自豪，这对他很重要，但他也觉得，如果他站出来说“我是黑人”，并把这作为他身份的核心，黑人社区是不会接受的，这会冒犯到别人。所以这是他对自己为什么没有像他的犹太身份那样，将黑人身份置于生活中心的解释。现在他的犹太身份非常核心。这是不同的，他给出的就是这些理由。正如我所说，身份认同，尤其是在当下这个时刻，是一个敏感的话题，人们会得出自己的结论。我真的很想看看读者对此的反应，他们会怎么看，他们会怎么看待他的轨迹，以及他哥哥说他在高中和大学时是一个年轻的黑人，而现在他强调的是犹太人的一面，而且犹太人的一面显然对他更重要。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, I mean, he, you know, listen, I mean, he's, you know, he um, you know, he feels that, you know, um, you that he he doesn't feel that he would be accepted by the black community as one of their own. I think that is one issue that, you know, and and and his experience has been different. I mean, he has said he says he has never felt the sting of racism. Yes. So it it would be it would be um you know fraudulent of him to claim that he's had this or that he's experienced life the way you know you know you know other black people have experienced life. He just he says that's not been my experience and he you know he doesn't disavow in any way um his black heritage. um he says he's proud of it. Um and and you know that it's important to him, but he also you know feels that you know if he went out there and and said you know I'm black and and and and you know um put that at the center of his identity that you the black community would not accept it that it would be offensive to people. And so this is this is his explanation um you know for why he's you know he's not centering it in his life in the way that you know his Jewishness is now very much center. It's it's you know it's different and and and and you know he you know these are the reasons he these are the reasons he offers and you as I said um you know this is you know this is identity is is is you know particularly in you know in this particular moment it's it's a fraught topic and and and you know people are going to draw their own conclusions and I'm I'm really interested to see how readers react to this and what they make of it and what they make of his his trajectory and and you know the fact that you know his brother says you know in high school and in college he was a young black man and and now it's, you know, he's he he, you know, it's the Jewish side that he emphasizes and the Jewish side that clearly um matters, you know, more to him,</p>

**Amit:** 对。关于学习障碍，这家伙有阅读障碍，却拿到了**新古典主义社会理论**（Neoclassical social theory: 一种社会学理论，试图将古典社会理论与现代社会学思想相结合）的博士学位。你和卡普围绕这个学习障碍的对话，如何突显了你对他作为企业家、领导者、最终作为创始人的看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Right? Uh learning disability, how do you think the I mean, this guy got a PhD in neoclassical theory while having dyslexia. I mean, how did your conversations around that learning disability with Karp accentuate how you think of him as a entrepreneur, leader, ultimately founder?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，他说，接续我们关于身份认同的对话，他说，看，阅读障碍才是他生命中真正的障碍，而不是种族主义。他从未经历过种族主义。阅读障碍才是真正的障碍。用他自己的话说，他有一种非常生动的表达方式，他说：“它折磨了我，但也给了我飞翔的翅膀。”

有趣的是，我以前不知道，但有研究和文章写过，不成比例数量的 CEO 和成功企业家似乎都有阅读障碍。我不知道具体比例是多少，但比如理查德·布兰森（Richard Branson）就有阅读障碍，著名的律师大卫·博伊斯（David Boies）也是，现在还有卡普。我们所知道的，以及卡普向我解释的，并且研究也证实了这一点，阅读障碍者有几个特点。其一，他们在任何特定时刻能处理的信息量不如其他人多，所以他们依靠更少的信息来应对。这可能导致他们能够根据手头的信息更快地采取行动。

他当然是这么觉得的。所以他可以根据更少的信息做出决策、得出结论，这使他能够更果断、更迅速地行动，他认为这对他在 CEO 岗位上取得的成功至关重要。另一个因素是，阅读障碍是一种残疾，你需要别人的帮助。你不能有那种自力更生的想法。当你建立一家公司时，你必须授权，必须让其他人参与进来。这不像“我，我自己，和我自己”那样。我想很多公司，尤其是当你看到企业家、创始人时，你会认为这是他们的心血结晶。他们在情感上和经济上都投入其中，对他们来说，下放责任可能真的很难。但在像卡普这样的人的案例中，他习惯于需要帮助，所以他习惯于团队合作、授权、并利用他人长处的想法，这是他作为一个阅读障碍者成长过程中就具备的。所以，他相信这使他成为一个更有效的领导者，并且对 Palantir 的成功至关重要。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, he says, you know, he you know, picking up from, you know, the the conversation about identity. I mean, he says, look at, you know, dyslexia was the real hurdle in his life, not racism. He never experienced racism. Dyslexia was the real hurdle. Um, and as he puts it, he, you know, he's got a very colorful way of expressing himself. He, you know, he said, "It [ __ ] me, but gave me wings to fly." And um you know what was very interesting and I did not know this but you know um there have been studies and and there have been articles written um you a disproportionate number of um CEOs and and and and successful entrepreneurs seem to be be dyslexic. um I don't know what the percentage is but like Richard Branson for instance dyslexic the the famed attorney David Boies and then now Karp and and and you know what um what we know and what Karp explained to me and research has borne this out there's a couple things about dyslexics um you know one they have to get they they can't process as much information in any given moment as other people so they get by on less information and and that can lead to you you know, being able to act more quickly on the information they have. And that's certainly the way he feels. So he can he can, you know, make decisions, reach conclusions based on less information and which allows him enables him to act more decisively um more quickly and decisively and he thinks that has been absolutely integral to the success he's had um as a CEO. And the other factor is you know dyslexics you know it is a disability and you need help from other people and you know you can't have this sort of you self-reliance is not you know something you can really have and and and you know when you get into you're building a company you have to delegate you have to get other people involved um you know it's not this you know me myself and I um you know and and you know I think with a lot of you know companies particularly you So, you know, when you have entrepreneurs, you have founders, I one would assume, you know, they're this is their baby. Um, they are, you know, emotionally and financially invested in it and it's probably really hard for them to delegate responsibility. Um, and in the case of someone like Karp, he is used to having, you know, because he's he he needed help before and he's, you know, and so, you know, he's used to working in the idea of working as a team and and and and of delegating authority and and of drawing on the strengths of other people is something that, you know, he grew up with as a dyslexic. So, you know, this, you know, he believes that this has made him a a more effective leader and and has in, you know, has been absolutely integral to Palantir's success.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 你认为他是否几乎把它看作是一种能让他脱颖而出的武器？卡普是一个不害怕与众不同的人。他似乎很喜欢自己与众不同的事实。你认为阅读障碍使他与传统学者如此不同，以至于为了在学术界生存，他必须付出双倍的努力，这最终影响了他在 Palantir 的生活吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Do you think that he almost sees it as uh a weapon that allows him to differentiate himself? I mean, Karp is someone who is not afraid to be different. He kind of you really likes the fact that he's different. Do you think dyslexia is makes makes him so different from a traditional academic that for him to you know survive in academia he had to work twice as hard which ultimately implicated his life in Palantir?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我不确定这一点，但我知道，很明显，他有这种学习障碍，然后却在哈弗福德取得了优异成绩，接着去了斯坦福法学院，然后又在法兰克福大学获得了博士学位。有这种障碍还能做到这些，这令人印象深刻。这需要付出巨大的努力，有时甚至是赫拉克勒斯般的努力。所以我不知道这如何转化为他在 Palantir 的表现，但我认为，他并不会过多地谈论他的阅读障碍。当他上 CNBC 或其他节目时，他偶尔会提到，但这并不是他特别想引起注意的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: You know I don't know about that but I mean I do know I mean obviously just the fact that he had this learning disability and then goes on to like you know I mean he he crushes it at Haverford he goes on to Stanford law and then he goes and earns a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt. I mean with this disability I mean that's impressive. I mean that's you know and and and as much as he downplays how hard he worked um I would imagine it was you know you know some herculean efforts at points um because of this and so you know I don't know that you know I don't know that how this translate to to Palantir but I mean I think you know certainly um you know and I don't know that you know I don't know that he because he doesn't I mean he talks a bit about his dyslexia But it's not something you know when he goes on CNBC or appears elsewhere he doesn't really he will occasionally mention it but it's not something that he you know seems to you know particularly interested in calling attention to.</p>

### 公众对 Palantir 的普遍误解

**Amit:** 好的。那么，我们来谈谈一些关于 Palantir 的话题，然后再回到卡普本人。我想，我们从这个问题开始，然后继续。你认为普通大众对 Palantir 的技术究竟做什么，是否存在不公正的理解？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay. So, let's get into uh some of the conversation on Palantir and then we'll get back to Karp himself. Um I guess let's let's start with this question and then we'll go from there. Do you think people in the general public have an unfair understanding of what Palantir's technology actually does?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我认为存在一些误解。你和我一样清楚，Palantir 这个名字现在几乎成了监视的同义词。而我书的副标题对此并没有什么帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: I think there are misconceptions. I mean, you know, you know as well as I do, um, that, yeah, the name Palantir is now almost synonymous with surveillance. And I'm not helping that with the subtitle of my book,</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 这其实让我有点惊讶。我不知道那会是副标题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Which actually was a bit surprising to me. I didn't know that was going to be the subtitle.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，我会告诉你，Palantir 的人，卡普已经看过这本书了。其他人也看过了，他们对此并不高兴。我认为，他们不是一家监视技术公司，但他们所做的部分工作确实可以促成监视。他们的软件可以帮助情报机构工作。而且，这家公司成立时部分资金来自 **In-Q-Tel**（In-Q-Tel: 美国中央情报局（CIA）旗下的非营利性风险投资机构），所以我不认为他们能轻易地撇清与监视的关联或担忧。但我确实认为存在一些根本性的误解，我希望这本书能澄清一些，比如人们总是想当然地认为他们收集数据、存储数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, you know, I and I will tell you, I mean, you know, you know, people at Palantir, you know, Karp has seen the book. Um, and people have other people have seen it and they're not thrilled about that. I think I think it is you know I it is they're not a surveillance technology company but you know part of the work they do is to you know can enable surveillance I mean they they they they can facilitate surveillance their software can help you know intelligence services with their work and and and obviously it was a company that was founded in part with an investment from In-Q-Tel so I don't think they can really disavow the surveillance connection or concern um that easily. But I do think there are some fundamental misconceptions and and one of the things I hope obviously with this book is that it'll clear up some fundamental misconceptions such as you know you see it all the time. I mean people just assume that they they collect the data, they store the data.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 向普通读者和公众传达这一点非常重要：他们不这么做。他们的软件是帮助组织更好地利用自己的数据。

为什么这一点似乎没有被大众所理解呢？嗯，听着，Palantir 只是在最近几年才变得家喻户晓。以前人们最多只是模糊地熟悉它。当 我开始写这本书的时候，很多人都说：“嗯？他是谁？Palantir 是什么？”这在过去三年里显然改变了，股价从每股 10 美元涨到近 200 美元，这自然会引起关注。所以现在认知度更高了。但人们对他们做什么有更好的理解了吗？也许在边缘地带有所改善，但我认为很多人仍然错误地认为这是一家收集数据、存储数据的公司。这无疑与 Facebook、Google 等公司有关，它们确实收集数据。你的数据就是它们的生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: And and and and it is obviously very important to get across that point to you know general interest readers to the public that that's not what they do. It is software that enables organizations to make better use of their own data. And and and you know why you know why this hasn't you know you why this hasn't you know penetrated with much of the public it seems well I mean listen Palantir only in the last few years has it become something like a household name you know you people were at best vaguely familiar with it and you know listen when I started writing the book I mean lots of people were like huh what you know who's he what's Palantir that has changed obviously just in in in in the last three years going from you know $10 a share to almost 200 will do that um but you know so there's greater recognition now is there um better understanding of what they do um maybe at the margins but I think a lot of people still labor under the misconception that this is a company that you know you that that that you know collects the data stores the data and and you know part of this is undoubtedly tied to you you know, Facebook, Google, I mean, which, you know, collect data. The business is, you know, your data is their business.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 这正是另一件事。你在书中谈了很多关于卡普如何鄙视这些消费者互联网公司。你认为为什么人们通常会很快地说 Palantir 是会窃取你数据的邪恶怪物，却不知道这根本不是他们做的事，而 Facebook 每年却实实在在地赚取数千亿美元的收入？为什么会有这种二分法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Well, that that that's that's the other thing that was I mean, you talk a lot about in the book how Karp has the disdain for some of these consumer internet companies. Why do you think generally people are very quick to say Palantir is the evil boogeyman that's going to steal your data, not knowing that that's quite literally not what they do, but Facebook quite literally makes hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue per year. Why is there that dichotomy?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 他很早就认识到，他很清楚 Facebook 和 Google 的业务性质。他也看到这可能对 Palantir 产生非常负面的影响。他们可能会被混为一谈。他明白一场灾难正在酝酿之中，尤其是在 Facebook 身上，而灾难确实发生了。数据被操纵、被抓取等等。所以他理解这其中的风险，也明白任何在这个领域运营的公司都有可能被卷入一场普遍的抵制浪潮中。所以他对 Facebook 和 Google 都有着非常合理的担忧。因此，他竭尽全力试图将自己区分开来。当然，这也加剧了他对 Facebook 的敌意，他将 Facebook 描述为一种“致癌物”和“寄生业务”。他想明确表示，Palantir 是不同的。那么，为什么 Palantir 会被单独挑出来呢？嗯，这是因为它合作的对象。这是无法回避的。你与情报机构合作，你与 **ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）合作。在特朗普第一届政府期间，他指出 Palantir 并不是唯一与 ICE 合作的科技公司。然后，在特朗普第一届总统任期内，一个复杂的因素当然是蒂尔（Thiel）。

他为 Palantir 吸引了很多关注。如果蒂尔没有与公司关联，Palantir 在特朗普第一届总统任期内会如此有争议吗？可能不会。但话说回来，公司与秘密机构合作，与执法部门合作，与 ICE 合作。所以从这个意义上说，争议对于 Palantir 来说是不可避免的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, he recognized early on he understood that, you know, that that he he he certainly understood, you know, from, you know, from the start, you know, the nature of Facebook's business, the nature of Google's business. And he also saw that this could have implications, very negative implications for Palantir. They could get lumped in. I mean, there was you, you know, he understood that there was just disaster waiting to happen. Um, certainly with Facebook and and and and and it did happen. I mean you know data was you know you know manipulated data was you know you know scraped and all that sort of stuff. So he understood the risks with this and he also understood that you know any any company operating in this area um was you know vulner was in danger of being swept up in a in a back a generalized backlash against it and and so that was a very legitimate concern that he had vis-a-vis Facebook certainly and Google you know as well and you know so took pay you know went to great lengths to try to differentiate himself and of course this also you know fed his hostility towards Facebook, which he describes as a carcinogen and a parasitic business. He wanted to make clear that, you know, that that um you know, Palantir was different. Now, why does Palantir get singled out? Well, it's because, you know, it it's because of who it works with. I mean, you know, you know, and that's you know, there there's no getting around that. And you know, you work with intelligence services. Um you work with ICE. um you know during the first you know Trump administration I mean he made the point that Palantir was not the only tech firm working with ICE um you know and then that got to the complicating factor there certainly during the first Trump presidency was Thiel. I mean he drew a lot of attention to Palantir um would Palantir have been you know this would Palantir have been so controversial the first Trump presidency if Thiel hadn't been associated with the company probably not but you know again it works you know the company works with clandestine services it's you know it works with law enforcement works with ICE so you know in that sense you know controversy was inevitable with Palantir.</p>
</details>

### 强大的工具与威权主义的风险

**Amit:** 是的，你知道，这是我过去几年报道这家公司时一直在努力解决的问题。这种努力体现在，我几乎把它看作一个挑战，去纠正那些试图通过说 Palantir 做了这个、做了那个来贬低它的人。我说，看，我客观上不反对听取关于 Palantir 做什么或不做什么的不同观点。但作为一个真正研究过其软件架构的人，我觉得事实并非如此。即使是与 **NHS**（National Health Service: 英国国家医疗服务体系）的合同，那也是一个非常有争议的合同，但他们最终拿下了。一年半后，你看到了积压工作减少的成果。所以你开始问自己，这些英国人是更关心叙事，还是更关心拥有更好的医疗保健？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah and you know it's something that I've struggled with over the past couple years covering the company uh and then struggle in the sense of I've almost seen it as a challenge of like correcting the people that would try to dunk on Palantir by saying they do this they do that and I'm like look I I objectively not opposed to hearing a different perspective on what Palantir does or what they don't do. But as someone who's actually studied the architecture of the software, I mean, it just doesn't feel like that's necessarily what's going on here. Even with the NHS contract, that was a very controversial contract that they ended up achieving. You're seeing the results a year and a half later of backlogs being reduced and like so you start asking yourself, do these people in the UK care more about the narrative counter? Do they care more about having better healthcare?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，这是一个很好的问题。在书中，我当然提到了 NHS，但你看，Palantir 在疫情期间所做的工作。关于当时发生的事情，有很多误解，我试图在那部分的讨论中澄清。人们都说没有大合同，这又是特朗普给蒂尔的某种好处，但事实并非如此。Palantir 为努力控制病毒传播以及后来的疫苗推广做出了宝贵的贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, and and that's a great question and I mean, you know, in the book I talk, you know, I mentioned, of course, the NHS, but you know, look at the work that you Palantir did during the pandemic. Um, and and and there's a lot of misconception um which I've tried to clear up in in that discussion about what went on then. You know, all talk no big contracts and that this is somehow another sop to to Thiel from Trump and it was none of those things. and and you know and and and you know Palantir um made an invaluable contribution um to the effort to to try to get some handle on the spread of the virus and then of course the vaccine roll out. I think</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 简直就是黛博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）说我们需要帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: It was quite literally Deborah Birx saying we need help.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我们需要帮助。这与特朗普毫无关系。正如 Palantir 的一位高管在谈到特朗普第一届总统任期内的另一个问题时对我说的，他说：“特朗普连 Palantir 怎么拼都不知道。”也许他现在知道了，但你知道的。但话说回来，存在这些叙事，而叙事会自己生根发芽。比如，我们之前谈到，它仍然被称为“蒂尔的 Palantir”。你在几乎所有关于 Palantir 的文章中都会看到“神秘的”这个词。

但好吧，他们对我非常开放，让我接触任何我需要的人。卡普给了我非凡的接触机会。但是，你看一下他们的网站，上面有大量的信息。是的，你只要去他们的网站就能学到很多关于 Palantir 的东西。

他们过去是不是更守口如瓶？是的。他们现在对某些事情仍然守口如瓶。有些事情他们不能谈论，比如与秘密机构的合作以及一些军事工作。但我认为，“神秘的”这个描述真的不再适用了。但同样，这些事情就是会自己发展。我试图在这本书中传达的一点，并且我希望我成功传达了，那就是，看，这是一家复杂的公司。它涉及很多不同的事情。有些事情你应该关注，有些事情他们可以被批评，但任何公正地描述这家公司所做的事情的叙述，也必须承认他们做了一些非常有益的事情，疫情就是一个例子。

然后，你知道，关于在英国的反应，我认为这很大程度上与围绕蒂尔的争议有关。他在那件事上没有帮上忙。我记得他去牛津联盟（Oxford Union）演讲，说英国人对 NHS 的依恋是一种**斯德哥尔摩综合症**（Stockholm syndrome: 指犯罪的被害者对于犯罪者产生情感，甚至反过来帮助犯罪者的一种情结）。

这并没有赢得英国多少人的好感。所以，我们稍后会谈到蒂尔，但我认为，最近在英国，当然也出现了真正的抵制，因为公司对以色列的支持。但这是 Palantir 面临的一个持续挑战。你如何让人们承认你做的好事，即使公司做的其他方面的事情被他们认为不那么值得称赞并引发争议。

<p class="english-text">Michael: We need help. It was it was nothing to do with nothing to do with Trump. I mean as someone a Palantir executive said to me in the context of another um issue during the first Trump presidency, he said Trump wouldn't know how to spell Palantir. Maybe he does now, but you know, so I mean, but again, I mean, there are these narratives um you know, and and and narratives sort of take hold. I mean, you for instance, I mean, just like kind of stepping back, I mean, you know, you will still I mean, we talked earlier, you know, it's still referred to as Teal's Palantir. You still see almost always in any article about Palantir secretive, but you know, I mean, okay, they were very open with me, gave me access to anyone I needed. Karp gave me, you know, extraordinary access. But, you know, I think you take a look at the website, there is a hell of a lot of information on their website. Oh, yeah. You can learn, you can learn a lot about Palantir by just going to their website. Um, you know, they were I more tight lipped in the past and they are still tight lipped about some things. There things they don't they can't talk about work with the clandestine services and so forth and some of the military work. But I think, you know, the I think the secretive um description really no longer applies. But again, these things just kind of take on a life of their own. And and and you know, and and so you know, you know, one of the points I'm try I think I I've succeeded in conveying in this in this book and and I hope I've conveyed is that look, it's complicated company. It's involved in so many different things. Um there are things you should be concerned about. There are things they can be criticized for, but you know, if you're any fair-minded account of what this company does, but also acknowledge that there are things that they have done that have been enormously beneficial and and the pandemic was one example of this. And then, you know, as you know, for you know, the reaction in the UK, I think it's you know, again, it's a lot of this is bound up in in the controversy over Teal. He didn't help in that case. you know, he goes and gives a talk at the Oxford Union, as I recall, and says that, you know, you know, Britain's attachment to the NHS is a form of Stockholm syndrome. That did not win over many people in the UK. So, you know, um and we'll get to Teal in a little bit, I know, but you know, I think, you know, there is, you know, and more recently, of course, in the UK, there's been real push back because of, you know, the support the company's given to Israel. Um but you know um you know and this is something they they have to this is an ongoing challenge for Palantir. Um you know sort of how do you get people to acknowledge the good work you know you know even if there are other aspects of what the company does that that they regard as you know not so audible then and that do cause controversy.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我想我们都会同意，而且我认为卡普也多次说过，如果 Palantir 落入坏人之手，其软件和技术是如此深刻、强大和有用，以至于可能被用于各种坏的方式。你认为这也加剧了围绕该公司的神秘感吗？即如果软件落入坏人之手，会被用于如此恶劣的方式，以至于人们几乎期望并希望软件能像卡普所说的那样，持续留在西方的盟友手中，这样软件至少有一个比落入俄罗斯或中国手中更宏大的指北星。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: I think we would both agree and I think Karp has said this many times that if Palantir was in the hands of the wrong people, the software and technology is so profoundly incredible and useful and powerful that it could be used in in a in a myriad of bad ways. Um do you think that also implicates to the mystique around the company that if the software was in the wrong hands it would be used in such bad ways that people are almost expecting and hoping that the software continuously stays in the allies of the west as Karp would say so that the software at least has a broader north star than the hands of Russia or China.</p>

**Michael:** 嗯，是的。有趣的是，当我在 2019 年、2020 年为《纽约时-报杂志》写那篇报道时，这一点对我来说很清楚，而且我认为至今仍然如此。关于 Palantir，一直存在两种相互矛盾的叙事。一种是，这是一种全能的技术，危险至极。另一种是，当然，当公司准备上市时，你看到很多东西表达了对其究竟有多好的怀疑，有人说，“哦，这基本上就是一堆烟雾弹。”通常，这些事情的答案是真相介于两者之间。但实际上，真相可能是，它确实是相当强大的软件。我曾把它描述为，它有碎木机的效率和培乐多彩泥的可塑性。我不知道 Palantir 的人是否会用这些确切的比喻，但我认为，从与客户的交谈中可以得知……

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, yeah. I mean, I think you know what has been interest what was interesting it was clear to me when I was doing the story for the times magazine back in 2019 2020 and and I think it even it persists to this day and and and you know this as well there there's been like two conflicting narratives about Palantir. Is this all powerful, you know, technology, dangerous as hell. And there's other, you know, there was certainly when the company was going public, you saw a lot of stuff expressing skepticism about just how good it was and you know that, you know, that people saying, "Oh, it's just you basically a lot of smoke and mirrors." Um, you know, usually the answer of these things is the truth is somewhere in the middle. Actually, the truth is probably it's it's it it is pretty powerful software. I mean, you know, the way I've described it is it's, you know, it's got the efficiency of a wood chipper and the malleability of Play-Doh. Um, I don't know if people at Palantir would use those exact analogies, but I think it is, I mean, you know, from talking to customers, um, you know, those</p>

**Michael:** 是的，是的。使用它的人都对它赞不绝口。他们认为它比市场上任何其他产品都要高出一筹。所以它确实很强大。我会稍微换个说法，这里不可避免地要谈到政治。但我会说，我在这里亮明了我的立场，我认为很多人从特朗普第一届总统任期中学到的教训之一是……我认为特朗普的第二届总统任期在某些方面有所不同，但我认为对许多人来说，教训是，如此强大的技术在威权政权手中可能成为一个非常有用的工具。我不是在评论特朗普，而是一个更普遍的评论，即这在威权政权手中会是一个非常强大的工具。一个政权……因为卡普的反驳，如果他参与这次对话，会是：“看，我们有这些隐私控制，我们认真对待公民自由。”他们确实如此，这绝对是真的。但最终，是最终用户决定如何严格地使用这些隐私控制和护栏。确实有过滥用的情况，但这与 Palantir 无关。他们出售软件，但并不监控其使用情况，当然不是每天都监控。所以存在风险，卡普对此非常坦率。他们没有卖给某些国家，比如沙特阿拉伯。奥巴马政府在“阿拉伯之春”期间曾表示有兴趣让他们把技术卖给沙特阿拉伯，因为担心沙特政权的稳定。

他们因为沙特阿拉伯的人权记录而选择不这么做，卡普不想助长任何侵犯人权的行为。所以他们过去确实因为担心软件可能被如何使用而拒绝过潜在客户。我认为，对于如此强大的技术，这始终是一个危险，无论是在企业界还是政府层面，都存在滥用的可能性，而且可能是大规模的滥用。他们的软件在不同地方处理大量个人数据，无论是在商业领域还是政府领域，人们必须对这些风险保持高度警惕，他们也确实如此，但最终，还是由客户来决定。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, those who use it swear by it. Um, and and they think it is, you know, just heads and shoulders above anything that they can get elsewhere in the market. And so you know it is powerful and you know I think you know I would rephrase it slightly and and I you know there's no avoiding politics and and and you know but I would say you know and I'm showing my hand here which you know I think you know one of the lessons that I think a lot of people took from the first Trump presidency was and and there was you know I think this this second Trump presidency is is different in some ways but I I think you know the lesson was for many people that you know technology this powerful um could be a very useful tool in the hands of an authoritarian regime and that's not you know I'm not commenting on Trump so much as just as a more general comment about you know this would be a very powerful tool in the hands of you know an authoritarian regime um you know that a regime that was not and and and you know there is you know because the the the the com the Karp's retort if he were part of this conversation would be like look at we've got these privacy controls we take civil liberties seriously and they do that is absolutely true but you know as you know it's the end user in the end who decides you know how rigorously to use those privacy controls to use those guard rails um you know and and and and there have been instances where stuff has been abused and has nothing to do with Palantir I mean they they you know they sell their software they don't monitor how it's used um you know certainly not on a daily basis. So you know there is risk and and and Karp has been very upfront about this and and as you know they've not sold to some that they they didn't sell to Saudi Arabia. Um you know the Obama administration expressed some interest in having them sell the technology to Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring because there was worried about there were fears about the stability of the Saudi regime. They chose not to do it because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record and and then Karp did not want to contribute to any human rights abuses. Um they so they you know they do they do they they have in the past turned down potential customers because of concerns about how it might be used. And I think you know that is that is always you know the danger with something with technology that is this that that is this powerful that that you know whether it's on the corporate side or the government side you the there is the potential for abuse and and for a lot of abuse and and and and you know there's a lot of personal data that flows through their software in different places you know whether on the commercial side or in the government space and you know one has to be very alert to these risks and they are, but you know, at the end of the day, it's the customer who decides.</p>

### 卡普的政治演变：从进步派到“MAGA”？

**Amit:** 那么，我们来谈谈政治话题吧，因为我认为这个话题也非常重要。我们从这里开始。你刚才说奥巴马政府曾考虑让 Palantir 把软件卖给沙特阿拉伯，而卡普拒绝了。这暗示他们与美国政府合作了很长时间。他们曾与奥巴马政府合作。

据我了解，奥巴马 2.0 驱逐的人比特朗普 1.0 还多，但 Palantir 却名声很差，尤其是在特朗普 1.0 时期。你认为为什么一家与政府合作的公司，无论执政的是民主党还是共和党，现在却被视为特朗普法西斯主义的邪恶威权工具？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: So, let's let's just transition into the political conversation because I think this is one is also really important. Let's start right here. You just said that the Obama administration was thinking of telling Palantir to to sell their software to Saudi Arabia and Karp said no. Uh, which implies that they've been working with the US government for a long time. They were working with the Obama administration. Uh, from my understanding, Obama 2.0 deported more people than Trump 1.0, but Palantir gets a pretty bad rap, especially in Trump 1.0. Why do you think a company that has worked with the government, whether it was a Democrat or a Republican in office, is now being seen as the evil authoritarian use of Trump's fascism?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，这是一个复杂的问题。回到特朗普的第一届总统任期，听着，正如你所指出的，与 ICE 的关系始于 2014 年奥巴马执政时期。

当时这并没有引起争议，而奥巴马当时也驱逐了很多人。我认为是特朗普的言论，以及他采取的一些措施，比如儿童分离政策，让人们感到不满。所以，特朗普执政期间做的一些事情与奥巴马时期是不同的。这是一方面。但我也认为，你不能低估蒂尔效应。彼得·蒂尔是特朗普在硅谷最大的支持者，也可能是 2016 年商界最大的支持者。他不是一个受欢迎的人物。所以很多事情都是通过那个棱镜来看的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, you know, it's it's a it's it's a it's a complicated question. I would say going back to the first Trump presidency, listen, you know, as you noted, I mean, the ICE the relationship with ICE began in 2014 under Obama. It wasn't controversial then and Obama was deporting a lot of people. Uh, I think it was the the the Trump's rhetoric and I think, you know, it was some of the stuff that was done um the child separation policy um that did not sit well with people. So, there was stuff that was done under Trump that was different that was being done under Obama. So, that's one thing, but I also think look at, you know, you can't you can't downplay, you know, the Thiel effect. you know, Peter was Thiel was his, you know, big you know, Trump's biggest supporter in Silicon Valley and probably the biggest supporter in the business community in 2016 and um you know, he was not a popular figure and and and and you know, so a lot of this was seen through that prism and and and so I think you know</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 是的。所以这更多是叙事而非现实，因为如果他们做的是同样的工作，是的，有些事情是不同的，但人们现在想把 Palantir 与邪恶联系起来，更多的是出于他们对特朗普的厌恶。你会这么说吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. So, so it was it was a bit more narrative than than reality because if they're doing the same work and yes, there are some things that are different, but people want to now associate Palantir with evilness. It's more so their disdain for Trump. You would say</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 这是很大一部分原因。不过，我也会说，因为他们不想与特朗普的移民政策扯上关系，他们早期强调说，我们是与 **HSI**（Homeland Security Investigations: 国土安全调查局）合作，而不是与另一边，即执法与遣返部门合作。他们公开这么说，但后来这种区分有点站不住脚了，因为 HSI 参与了一些突袭行动，然后他们说，“是的，Palantir 的软件在其中发挥了作用，但只是很小的作用。”所以，我认为他们有点自食其果，因为他们否认与移民镇压有任何联系，而实际上软件在其中扮演了某种角色。再说一次，不管大家对移民、对无证人员有什么看法，从我的角度来看，特朗普第一届总统任期内做的一些事，比如将孩子与父母分开，很多家庭至今未能团聚，这是一项很难辩护的政策。为它辩护不是 Palantir 的角色，但如果你以任何方式牵涉其中，你也会受到一些抨击。所以，但是我也认为，卡普，我们在 2019 年就此进行过很多对话，他指出其他科技公司也在与 ICE 合作，但他们却没有受到抗议。针对 Palantir 的行动没有针对其他公司。一方面，他把这看作是一种变相的恭维。他说，这在某种程度上是对他们软件确实很好的默认，但这也让他非常生气，因为他们单单挑出了 Palantir。我认为，部分原因是因为 Palantir 与秘密机构合作，毫不掩饰其与政府在某些让人们担忧的领域合作的热情，但同样，很大一部分原因是因为彼得·蒂尔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: That's a big part of it though. I mean, I will also say that, you know, um they were you because they didn't want to be associated with Trump's in, you know, immigration policy. They emphasized, you know, early on that we work with HSI. we're not working with, you know, you know, the other side, you know, you know, enforcement and removal and and and so they were saying that publicly and then that distinction kind of collapsed because HSI was involved in some raids and then they said, "Yeah, Palantir software is playing a part, but it's a very minimal part." So, you know, I think they sort of, you know, hurt themselves there a bit by just, you know, disavowing any connection with, you know, the immigration crackdown when in fact the software was playing some role in it. And again, it was, you know, you know, listen, I mean, you know, how everyone feels about immigration, how everyone feels about, you know, you know, undocumented people, I, you know, from my point of view, there was stuff done during the first Trump presidency. I mean separating children from their parents and you know and and and and a a lot of kids a lot of families haven't been reunited still. Um you know that's that's it's a hard policy to defend. Um and and and it's not Palantir's role to defend it but if you're in any way implicated in that you know you're going to you're going to take some slings and arrows too. So, you know, um, but I also think and and and you know, Karp, we had a lot of conversations back in 2019 about this and and and he made the point that other technology companies were working with ICE and yet they weren't, you know, being, you know, they weren't being protested. The the program that was directed at Palantir wasn't being directed at others. And, you know, on the one hand, he took it as a backhanded compliment. He's like, you know, it's it it was sort of a task acknowledgement that the software was really good, but it also really pissed him off because they were singling out Palantir. And I think it's, you know, part of it is because, you know, Palantir worked with the clandestine services, made no bones about its enthusiasm for working with the government and in areas that kind of gave people some concern, but also again big part of it was because of Peter Teal.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 嗯，我听说卡普在过去一年里开始强调一个观点，即在我们正在谈论的移民问题上，边境管制很重要，拥有一个安全可靠的边境是国家主权的基石。他将其与德国正在发生的事情以及我们所看到的情况进行比较，认为这对西方来说不一定是最好的事情。几天前，Axios 发表了一篇文章，标题是“卡普已经完全 **MAGA**（Make America Great Again: “让美国再次伟大”，唐纳德·特朗普的竞选口号，已成为其政治运动的标志）化了”。卡普对此回应说，写这篇文章的人，也就是写了这本书的你，充满了 **TDS**（Trump Derangement Syndrome: 特朗普紊乱综合症，一个贬义词，用来形容对唐纳德·特朗普非理性的负面反应），尽管你是个好人。所以，我想直接问你这个问题。你正在谈论移民和边境问题，如果卡普现在参与这场对话，他会说，一个健康的边境确实很重要，这无关政治，这只是关于，嘿，我们是否希望非法移民抢走工作岗位？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Well, so I've heard Karp over the past uh year start to stress the idea that, you know, on the topic of immigration that we're speaking of, uh border control matters and having a safe and secure border is the fabric for the sovereignty of your country. And he compares it to what's going on in Germany and things that we're seeing and how it's not necessarily the best thing for the West. Um, an article came out uh on Axios a couple of days ago that it was titled Karp has gone full MAGA and uh Karp responded to this by saying the person who wrote the article you uh who also wrote the book is filled with TDS even though you're a good person. So, so, so just straight up I want to ask you the question. You know, you're you're talking about immigration and borders and if Karp was in this conversation right now, he would say, well, a healthy border really does matter and that's not political. That's just like, hey, do we want legal immigrants taking away jobs? Things that</p>

**Michael:** 好的，我不会回避你的问题。我会回答你的问题，但首先我想说的是，看，他在这件事上的观点已经演变了。你回头看看他在特朗普第一届政府期间对我和其他人说的话。他对我说：“我完全支持这个国家的人口结构改变，只要是通过合法移民实现的。”对此他没有任何问题。他在这方面的观点已经演变了。他认为 2024 年的选举是保持国家人口结构不变的投票。因此，他现在对支持 ICE 毫无顾虑。在特朗普第一届总统任期内，他确实有些顾虑，事实上他说过，如果他早知道会发生什么，他可能不会与 ICE 签订合同。所以，那是特朗普的第一届总统任期。所以他的观点已经演变了。我想说，当他说“特朗普紊乱综合症”时，我认为部分原因是因为，我在书中挖出了他当初在 2015 年特朗普首次成为候选人时对特朗普说的一些话，卡普说了一些相当严厉的话。他明确表示他不是支持者。而现在，特朗普再次当选总统。你知道，在唐纳德·特朗普的华盛顿，做生意的第一条规则就是别惹唐纳德·特朗普。第二条规则是尽你所能去讨好他。

<p class="english-text">Michael: All right. I'm gonna I'm not going to avoid your question. I'm going to get to your question, but the first thing I would say is like look at his views have evolved on this issue. Um, you go back and and and look at the stuff he said to me and others, you know, during the first Trump administration. Um, you know, he said to me, I am totally in favor of the I'm totally fine with the demographics of this country changing if it's changed through legal immigration. No issue with that. His views have evolved on that. Um, he believes that the 2024 election was a vote to keep the demographics of the country the same. Um, and and and hence he has no qualms now about supporting ICE. He was he was you know he did have some qualms in 20 during the first Trump presidency and in fact said that if he had known what was going to happen he might not have signed the contract with ICE. Um so you know that was the first Trump presidency. So his views have evolved. Um, I would say that, um, you know, when he says Trump derangement syndrome, it's, you know, I think part of this is because, you know, in the book I'm dredging up stuff he said about Trump when Trump, you know, you know, first became a candidate in 2015 and and and and Karp said some pretty harsh stuff. He made very clear he was not a supporter. And it's it's now, you know, Trump is president now again. And it's, you know, and and then, you know, listen, the way it works is the first rule of business in Donald Trump's Washington is don't piss off Donald Trump. The second rule is do what you can to ingratiate yourself with him.</p>

**Michael:** 我想，听着，我很好奇我的书在一些进步派期刊上会得到怎样的评价，如果它被评论的话。因为我完全预料到，在某些地方可能会有严厉的评价，说我对卡普太宽容了。这些人并不真正喜欢他，不真正喜欢 Palantir，也不喜欢亿万富翁。但我希望它能被以开放的心态阅读，因为，你回到 2019 年，卡普对我说过，书里也引述了，他说：“看，我不认为人们反对移民，他们只是对非法移民不满，他们不喜欢边境的混乱景象。你要么认真对待他们的担忧，要么他们就会转向那些确实认真对待他们担忧的政客。”

<p class="english-text">Amit: And the second one was a mandate given the swing states that he won, I think.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，他确实赢了。他赢得了一场重大的胜利。我认为这对人们来说不算是授权，但他赢了。很明显，选民们……现在的民调显示，人们对现在的做法并不满意。但我认为，对移民的看法似乎比想象中更微妙。不是人们反对移民，而是他们不喜欢边境的混乱景象。卡普在 2019 年就说过，你必须认真对待这些事情。如果你不这样做，你不会喜欢接下来发生的事情。我认为任何公正的人都很难说他在这件事上是错的。所以，他……我不认为加密货币之类的事情是他关心的，或者不是特别关心。对他来说最重要的是国家安全，显然还有边境。而且我认为，他相信……我们稍后可以谈到 10 月 7 日，那件事在他的思想中是一个非常大的因素。但我认为，他的政治演变肯定可以追溯到特朗普的第一个总统任期。他当时说，你必须认真对待这些事情，否则选民会转向那些认真对待的人。但人们没有听他的，反而在抗议 Palantir。所以他很 perturbed，他的进步派同伴们转而反对 Palantir，反对他，把他们描绘成邪恶的人物。这把他推开了。然后还有新奥尔良发生的事情，我在书里谈到了。他们与执法部门的合作引起了很多争议，而很多争议可能被夸大了，因为他们在美国实际上并没有与市政警察部门做那么多工作。这对他们来说并不是一个非常成功的努力，现在他们已经不与美国任何市政警察部门合作了。这是一个非常复杂的问题，正如卡普自己所说。有种族化执法的历史，人们对新奥尔良的数据驱动警务有很多担忧。但在新奥尔良，凶杀案泛滥，90% 的受害者是黑人，90% 的肇事者也是黑人。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, he did. I mean, he won, you know, he won a significant victory. I think it's less of a mandate to people but you know give it but he won and and and and you know and and and and you know it's very clear that voters you know you know polling now is like you know I think you know polling clearly indicates that people are not really happy about how this is being done now but I think you know I think you know the views on immigration seem a little more are a little more subtle than you know it's not that people are against immigration but you they again they don't like scenes of chaos at the border and Karp back in 2019 said you don't look at um you know, you got to take this stuff seriously. If you don't, you know, you're not going to like what happens. And I think it would be very hard, you know, for anyone who's on who's fair-minded about it to say, well, he was wrong about that. Um and and and so, you know, he you know, I don't think crypto or anything like that is of concern to him or not particularly concern. What's paramount to him? The things that matter to him are national security are, you know, the border clearly and and just, you know, and I think, you know, he believes him and we can get to October 7 later. that was a very big factor in in in in in his thinking. But I think, you know, his evolution politically certainly goes back to the first Trump presidency. um he did not you know he's saying this he's saying you know you got to take this stuff seriously or the voters are going to turn to people who do and instead of listening to him you know um you know people are protesting Palantir and and and and you know so he's I think he was you know quite perturbed that his fellow progressives you had turned on Palantir had turned on him had made them you know the the these you out to be these evil figures and so that you know sort pushed them away and and and then you know there was you know the stuff that happened in New Orleans which I'll talk about with the book. I mean there's a lot of controversy about their work with law enforcement and and a lot of that controversy was you know probably overblown because they didn't really do that much work with municipal police departments in the United States. It wasn't a very successful effort for them and and and now they're not working with any municipal police departments in the United States and and and you know it's a very complicated issue as Karp himself said. I mean, you know, there's a history of racialized policing, a lot of concern about data-driven policing in New Orleans, though. I mean, it was, you know, you know, New New Orleans had an epidemic of homicides and, you know, 90% of the victims were black, 90% of the perpetrators were black. I mean, that was, you know,</p>

**Amit:** 所以，当他从一个他一生都是的彻头彻尾的进步派转变时，那篇文章的标题是他现在已经完全 MAGA 化了。那么问题就来了，他作为一个进步派，是变成了 MAGA，还是像你这样的进步派，患有严重的 TDS，以至于看不到现实？

So the question then comes down to has he as a progression got gone has he as a progressive gone MAGA or have the progressives like yourself have a massive case of TDS that aren't reality</p>

<p class="english-text">Michael: So there's that. I would say that he um yeah has you know during the first Trump presidency he made very clear he did not like Trump. He did not want Trump as president. He didn't you know uh he made his disapproval loud.</p>

**Michael:** 嗯，他很……在她……拜登下台后，她成为候选人之后，我们在八月份有过一次谈话，那是在民主党大会之后，当时他认为她的大会开得很好，他想，好吧，也许她能赢。但到了选举日，选举前的那个周末，他就不那么确定了，但他仍然认为特朗普会赢。但我是说，好吧，他支持她，但如果他支持她，那也是非常不情愿的。他不是一个热心的人。

特朗普赢了，而且，看，如果你是一家与美国政府做生意的公司，而他们确实与政府有很多生意往来，你必须得站队。但我会说，与某些其他科技高管相比，我就不点名了，但你知道我指的是谁，他们的机会主义就像汗水一样往下滴。他找到了支持的理由。不仅仅是因为你必须这么做，而是有些事情他现在是赞成的。他现在在移民问题上是个强硬派。我在书中广泛地谈到了这一点，他现在与彼得·蒂尔的观点更加一致。他改变了主意，不仅仅是因为他将特朗普 2024 年的第二次选举胜利视为保持国家人口结构不变的投票，他也通过 10 月 7 日的棱镜来看待这个问题，即以色列发生的事情，以及他所看到的大学校园里反犹主义的爆发。在 10 月 7 日之前，他认为移民问题对民主党来说是一个有毒的问题。10 月 7 日之后，他也认为这对美国犹太人来说是一个有毒的问题。这是书中我认为会引发大量讨论和相当多争议的一部分。他谈到了……我的意思是，你读了，你也是这么看的吗？

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well he was pretty I mean he kind of you know after she after you know Biden you know stepped aside and she became candid I mean I we had a conversation was in August it was after the Democratic convention and he was then he thought you know she'd had a really good convention he thought okay maybe she could win by election day by the the weekend before the election he was like he didn't think she would win he wasn't sure but he still thought Trump would win but I mean yeah okay so he's supporting but I you know, if he supported her, it was very reluctantly. He was not an enthusiast. And and and you know, Trump wins and and and look at I mean, if you're if you're a company that does business with the US government and they do a lot of business with the government, you sort of have to get on board here. But um I would say in contrast to some other um tech executives, I won't name names, but you know who I'm referring to. The opportunism kind of drips off them like sweat. Um you know, he he found reasons to get behind. It's not just because you have to, but there are things that you know that he you know, find that he approves of now. I mean, he is now he's now a hardliner on immigration. He, you know, and and and and I talk about that extensively in the book and and and he's much more in line now with with Peter Thiel's view. um he um you know he's he's he's changed his mind about it, you know, not just because he sees the Trump's second election victory 2024 as a as a as a vote to keep the demographics of the country the same, but he also sees it through the prism of October 7th, what happened in Israel, the out, you know, what he saw as an outbreak of anti-semitism on on college campuses. And you know, before October 7th, he saw immigration as a as a toxic issue for the Democrats. Um, after October 7th, he also sees it as a as a toxic issue for American Jews. Um, you know, and and this is this is a part of the book that I think is going to generate a lot of conversation and and a fair amount of controversy. He spoke with I mean that you read it.

### 地缘政治的十字路口：以色列与乌克兰

**Amit:** 是的，我想我们就此转到关于以色列的对话。我认为这是书中一个相当微妙的部分。显然，卡普是犹太人，他看到 10 月 7 日的暴行，相当于美国有 5 万人遇害。

他一直明确表示自己是犹太人，从不回避。如果有人问他，他会谈论。

这带回了一种感觉，就是，我们一直说“永不再发生”，而现在它正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, I I think let's just transition then to the to the Israel conversation here. So, I thought this was a pretty nuanced part of the book. Obviously, Karp is Jewish and he saw the atrocities of October 7th, equivalent to, you know, 50,000 people in the United States. Um, he's always been explicitly Jewish. He never hides away from it. If he if someone asks him, he'll he'll talk about it. And this brought back the sense of, well, we've always said never again, and now it's happening.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 与此同时，你在书中引用了一些话，说卡普不介意内塔尼亚胡（Netanyahu）不是总统，因为以色列政府在巴勒斯坦所做的一切可能并不完全一致。所以，我想问题是，我们先从 10 月 7 日发生了什么开始，那件事真正让卡普在《纽约时报》上刊登广告，说“我们与以色列站在一起”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: At the same time, you have some quotes in the book that says Karp wouldn't mind if uh Netanyahu, let's just say, wasn't the president, given there might not be a full alignment between everything the Israeli government has been doing in uh Palestine. So, I guess the question here is we'll just start it off with what do you think happened on October 7th that really got Karp to take out a an advertisement in the New York Times and say we stand with Israel?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，我认为这又回到了我早先提出的观点。理解卡普的关键在于他从小就有的那种脆弱感。即使他积累了财富，拥有庞大的安保团队，他仍然有这种脆弱感。10 月 7 日，以色列的这场大屠杀，震撼了他，也震撼了许多犹太人。这是自大屠杀以来最大规模的对犹太人的屠杀。他一直知道反犹主义是世界上的一股强大力量，犹太人是脆弱的，但这件事以一种在他有生之年、在我有生之年都未曾有过的方式，让他深刻地感受到了危险。再次强调，不要低估他的恐惧因素。这是理解 Palantir 的关键。正如他在 2019 年对我说的，他的恐惧驱动了这家公司的很多特质。所以，这对世界来说是一次巨大的、地震般的事件，对 Palantir 来说也是巨大的，在个人层面上，这对他来说是一件非常非常重大的事件，一件让他从内心深处感到震撼的事情，并以各种方式激励了他。他从一开始就对所发生的事情非常直言不讳，并对其他人没有发声感到沮丧。他和我谈过这个，书里也有。他对商界其他领导人没有发声或表示支持以色列感到非常沮丧。他说：“为什么只有我一个人？”所以他真的……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, I think this gets back to the point I made earlier. you have, you know, the key to understanding Karp is this sense of vulnerability that he's had, you know, from a very young age. And and again, even with the wealth he has amassed, even with his, you know, vast security detail, he still has this sense of vulnerability. Um, and and October 7th, I mean, this pogrom in Israel, um, you know, shook him, um, as it shook many Jews. I mean, it was, you know, it was the largest, you know, killing of Jews since the Holocaust. And um he you know this this this you know again this he always you know always knew that anti-semitism was a was a powerful force in the world that you know Jews were vulnerable but this really in a way that you know not in his lifetime not in mine um you know brought home the danger and and again he you know do not discount the fear factor for him. I mean you know this is this is essential to understanding Palantir. um you know as he told me way back in 2019 his fear drives a lot of what makes this company what it is and and and and so you know this was just a huge event for you know a seismic event obviously for the world huge for Palantir and and on a personal level just you know just a major major event for him and and something that you know shook him to the core and and and you know galvanized him in all sorts of ways and and and he was very outspoken about, you know, about what happened and and and from the start and and and was frustrated that other people weren't speaking out. Um, you know, he talks about he talked about that with me. It's in the book. I mean, he's very frustrated that other leaders in the business community are not speaking up or not expressing support for Israel. You know, he says, "Why am I the only one?" And and you know, and and so he really goes,</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 你认为为什么这让他如此生气？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: "Why do do you think that pissed him off so much?"</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 因为他认为他们是懦夫。他相信他们中的许多人百分之百同意他的观点，但正如他所说，他们只是不想被大学生们尖叫。他们不想被那些对以色列不满的人尖叫。所以他们只想低调行事。而这显然不是他的行事方式。他不会低调行事。在这种情况下，他当然没有，但这让他很恼火。我认为关于以色列的章节是理解他如何走到今天这一步的真正关键，因为在这里你不仅看到他正在理清思路，他已经相当确信特朗普会赢。所以这是 2023 年、2024 年，我们正在进行这些对话。他相当确信特朗普会赢。但在这里你开始看到他像是开始支持特朗普。他几乎是在说，他认为特朗普的胜利对以色列更好，美国犹太人在特朗普治下会更安全。我认为你可以在这里看到这一点。我们有一次谈话，大概是在 10 月 7 日之后的一两周。关于卡普，你必须了解的另一件事是他喜欢争论。这是他的一部分，这对 Palantir 来说是不可或缺的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Because he thought that they were being cowards. That, you know, he believed that many of them, you know, agreed with them 100%. But just didn't, you know, as he said, they didn't want to be screamed at by, you know, by, you know, college kids. They want to be screamed at by, you know, people who were, you know, who were unhappy with Israel. And and and so, you know, they just wanted to keep their heads down. And and that's that's obviously not the way he does things. Um, he doesn't keep his head down. Um, and in this case, he he certainly didn't, but it it it irritated him. and and you know and and and you know this is you know I think the chapter on Israel is you know the sort of real key to understanding how he got here because you know he's you know this is where you see him not just wrapping his mind I mean he's pretty convinced that Trump is going to win. So this is, you know, 20, you know, 23 we're having these kind 2023, 2024, we're having these conversations. He's pretty convinced that Trump is going to win. But this is where you start to see him like sort of like getting on board with Trump. Um, you know, you know, that's where he is all but saying that he thinks, you know, a Trump victory would be better for Israel and that, you know, American Jews would be safer under Trump. Um, and I think that's where you kind of see it. I mean, there's this conversation we have. It's like a week or two after October 7th. And you know the thing, one of the other things you have to understand about Karp is he likes to argue. Um that's you know it's you know he likes to and and and that's been integral to Palantir says I mean like from the</p>

**Amit:** 智力上的交锋非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Intellectual sparring really matters.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 是的，但在 Palantir，从一开始就需要有开放的讨论。你需要人们能够坦率地说话，直言不讳，即使是针对 CEO 也要强力反驳。正如 Aki Jain 对我说的，卡普的观点是，你应该能够对 CEO 说“去你的”。这就是……在这种非常激烈、温室般的氛围中，人们交流思想，对他们认为错误的事情进行强力反驳，你就能开发出更优秀的产品，最终也证明了这一点。但他就是喜欢争论。这是他的本性。他就是这样长大的。一个非常活跃的家庭。他的表弟 Matt Johnson 告诉我，他以前常听到他们争论。他去那里吃饭，走出去后，在人行道上还能听到他们——卡普和他的父母、兄弟——在争论。所以事情就是这样。我们在他华盛顿的办公室里进行这次谈话，大概是 10 月 7 日后的一两周。这很有趣，因为关于他的另一件事是，他非常有说服力，非常令人信服，说话时充满绝对的自信。但在这种情况下，他似乎不是在试图说服我。他只是说：“我不认为唐纳德·特朗普是法西斯主义者。我不认为他是反犹分子。我不认为他是个偏执狂。”诸如此类的话。而我什么都没说。我感觉他只是在为自己铺路，让自己说出：“如果我必须支持这件事，我可以。”我现在确实认为，我知道他认为特朗普当总统对以色列更好，对美国犹太人更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: It is but like you know at Palantir it was like from the start like there needed to be an open discourse. You need to have you know people need to be able to speak candidly frankly push back hard even against the CEO. I mean, as Aki Jain said to me, you know, Karp's view was you should be able to tell even the CEO to go [ __ ] himself. And that was, you know, that was and out of this very intense hot house atmosphere, you know, people batting around ideas, pushing back hard against things they thought were wrong, you would, you know, develop, you know, superior products and that ultimately proved to be the case. But he just likes to argue. Um, and and and and and you know, it's, you know, it's who he is. It's how he grew up. I mean, a very animated household. I mean, you know, Matt Johnson, his cousin, tells me, you know, he used to hear them arguing. He he'd be over there for dinner. He walks out and he hear them from from the sidewalk arguing. Karp and his parents and his brother. So, this is just how it is. And um you know, he um you know, we're having this conversation in his Washington office. It's like a week or two after October 7th. And you know, this was like interesting because like you know, another thing about him is, you know, he's very persuasive, very convincing, speaks with utter conviction. Um, but in this case, it wasn't like me he was trying to convince. Like he just like, you know, he says, you know, like I don't, you know, I don't think Donald Trump's a fascist. I don't think he's anti-semitic. I don't think he's a bigot. And all this stuff. And there was nothing I had said. It was just more sort of him just sort of I felt like he was just sort of working his way into like saying, I can get on board. If I have to get on board with this, I can. And and and I do think I certainly now I think now I mean I know that he thinks that you know that that that Trump is you know having Trump as president is better for Israel in his view better for American Jews.</p>

### 乌克兰战争：捍卫西方的使命

**Amit:** 另一个非常重大的地缘政治事件，你在书中也讨论了，是乌克兰和俄罗斯。

卡普是首批到达那里的 CEO 之一。我实际上不知道关于波兰的故事，他必须经历所有这些不同的……我不知道那是怎么发生的，但他到了那里。他见到了泽连斯基（Zelenskyy）。然后有一段时间，他不能公开说他们的软件是乌克兰能够抵抗的原因。但有一天他说：“去他的，我们要让世界知道。”你对他钦佩乌克兰人民，并确保他们的软件在乌克兰前线的看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh, another geopolitical event that was pretty massive and you discussed in the book was Ukraine, Russia. Karp was one of the first CEOs to to get to I actually didn't know the story about Poland and he had to go through all these different like I I I didn't know how that happened, but he got there. He got to meet Zelenskyy. Uh, and then for a while he he wasn't allowed to publicly say that their software was the reason why Ukraine was putting up a fight. But then one day he said, "Screw it. We're going to let the world know." What what was your take on his um admiration for the Ukrainian people and for making sure their software was at the forefront of Ukraine.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，听着，从一开始，Palantir 就说它是在捍卫西方，不仅仅是美国，是捍卫整个西方。有趣的是，从一开始，他们就说有两个国家我们不卖给它们。我们不卖给中国，也不卖给俄罗斯。想想看，你谈论的是一家 2003 年成立的公司，告诉潜在投资者“哦，我们不打算在中国销售”，那可是最大的新兴市场。Palantir 本来就很难推销，这样做无疑让事情变得更难了。所以，这些可以说是大胆，或者说是疯狂的决定。俄罗斯还好，但中国肯定是。当然，现在这被证明是正确的。但这花了很长时间。所以，他和他的同事都将俄罗斯和中国视为根本上的对手。当然，当俄罗斯在 2022 年入侵乌克兰时，这证实了这一点，好像还需要什么证实似的。他相信，就像当时很多人说的那样，这是一场为自由世界对抗暴政的斗争。我认为，参与其中的部分吸引力在于，特朗普时代很艰难。对 Palantir 来说很难，对他来说也很难。反恐战争，他们的软件在阿富汗和伊拉克被使用，但整个事情变得一团糟。反恐战争陷入争议，关塔那摩等等。然后是特朗普第一届总统任期内所有的国内争议，ISIS 等等。现在终于有了一个案例，特朗普走了，Palantir 明确地站在了正义的一方——乌克兰。所以，这对他来说是一个巨大的解脱。他想引起人们对这件事的关注，并为此感到非常自豪。但当然，他们必须谨慎行事。这是另一个让他感到沮丧的来源，因为他们的很多工作都是在暗中进行的，比如秘密机构、反恐等等。你知道，这已经说了很久了，自 9/11 以来快 25 年了，我们很少知道那些被挫败的恐怖袭击。这些信息不会与公众分享，这也是对的。但他对我说，20 年来他一直感到沮，因为 Palantir 做的很多重要工作都无法被认可，因为它发生在暗处，也应该留在暗处。所以，乌克兰事件发生了。我当时和他在一起，就在入侵之后。他现在开始给股东和投资者写信，配合每次的财报发布。他们在写一封信，信的结尾是“Palantir 的软件，Palantir 的技术在乌克兰的战斗中”。

然后那句话不得不被编辑掉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, I think listen, I mean, you know, from the start, you know, Palantir said it was about defending the West, not just the United States, about defending the West. And, you know, it's interesting because, you know, there from the start, they said there are two countries we're not selling this to. We're not selling it to China and we're not selling it to Russia. and and and think about that because you you're talking about you know company starts 2003 and and you know telling you know potential investors oh we're not going to sell in China um the death wish largest emerging market and you know Palantir was a tough sell to begin with that didn't make it any easier I would I'm sure and so you know those were like sort of bold you know slash crazy calls Russia less so but certainly China now of course it's been vindicated Um but that took a long time and and and so you know you know he saw but he saw both he and his colleagues saw both Russia and China as fundamentally adversarial and and and and and you know certainly when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 that was confirmation as if anyone needed it that it was fundamentally adversarial. And he believed, as many people said at the time, that this was a fight for, you know, really the fight for the the free world um versus, you know, tyranny. Um and and part of the appeal for getting involved with this, I believe, and it's quite clear. Um the Trump years were hard. They were hard, you know, for Palantir. They were hard for him. Um you know look at I mean you know the war on terrorism you know they you know the software was being had been used in Afghanistan and Iraq but you know the whole thing had sort of become you know a shitshow you know the war on terrorism you know was you know mired in controversy you know Guantanamo all this sort of stuff. So, you've got that and then you've got, you know, obviously all the domestic controversy during the first Trump presidency, ISIS and and and and so forth. Here was a case finally, okay, Trump is gone and here's a case where Palantir is unequivocally on the side of good Ukraine and and and and and so, you know, that was a huge relief for him. Um something he wanted, you know, to call attention to. Um you know, took great pride in it. But of course, yeah, they've got to be circumspect. This is another source of frustration because you know so much of their work is in the shadows I mean you know clandestine services and so forth counterterrorism and and and you know it's you know and this has been said forever you know in the you know ever since 9/11 many in almost 25 years since then you know we rarely find out about the terrorist attacks that were thwarted you know it's just like it's not shared with the public um and and and rightly so but you know he said to me it's been a 20-year frustration that you know a lot of the essential work that Palantir was doing, you know, couldn't be recognized because it was taking place in the shadows and that where was that's where it was supposed to remain. So, you know, Ukraine happens. I'm with him. You know, this is, you know, right after the invasion. And, you know, he he is now doing these letters to shareholders, you know, um to investors, you know, time to to coincide with each earnings report. and they're writing and and and actually this was I'm trying to remember if there was an they were doing an earnings report around that but he's in Washington and they're writing writing a letter and you letter finishes you know Palantir software Palantir technologies in the fight in Ukraine and you know that had to be edited out you know the fight yeah and and</p>

**Michael:** 为西方而战，没错。这再次加剧了他的挫败感。几个月后，他去了达沃斯。因为如果你还记得，2022 年 1 月的达沃斯因为新冠疫情取消了，所以他们在 5 月份举行。我当时和他在一起，那里有很多乌克兰官员。他与他们会面，他们显然支持 Palantir 支持乌克兰。一些官员说：“你想来见见泽连斯基吗？”卡普对我说：“我在考虑去基辅。”我想，好吧，那太好了。我以为是等事情平息下来，结果下周他就在那儿了。他想表达他的支持。他发现他非常非常喜欢泽连斯基。那次会面让他感觉与他有种亲切感。所以，这是一种向世界宣告“Palantir 参与其中”的方式，也是为了获得那些年来在反恐和暗中工作时无法获得的认可，他觉得公司应得的认可。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Michael: Fight for the west exactly um and and you know again just you know sort of reinforcing this frustration he felt and so what happens a couple months later he goes to Davos because if you Remember, Davos was canceled in January of of 2022 because of COVID. So, they held it in May. Um, COVID was still around. I know because I got COVID when I got home. Um, but I'm with him there and there are Ukrainian officials all over. Uh, not all over, but there are a number of Ukrainian officials there and he meets with them and they're obviously supporting Palantir is supporting Ukraine and and and and some officials said, "Would you like to come and meet Zelenskyy?" and and you know, Karp says to me, I'm thinking about going to Kyiv. And I'm like, okay, that's great. And I'm thinking, you know, when things quiet down next week, he's there. And and and that was, you know, he wanted to show his support. He found he was just, you know, he really really liked Zelenskyy. You know, the meeting was just, you know, just he really felt a kinship with him. So, you know, and and and and it was a way of saying to the world, Palantir's involved and and and of getting, you know, sort of, you know, the the credit that it couldn't claim for all those years and was working on counterterrorism and and in the shadows and stuff, never getting the credit he felt it deserved.</p>

**Michael:** 你看，这款软件正在被用于二战以来欧洲最大规模的陆地战争，这可能是西方的转折点。卡普正在成为……他的公众角色在那时发生了变化。他决定不再称自己为“疯子 CEO”，因为他已经变成了某种政治家式的 CEO，人们想听他说话。他去波罗的海国家，从机场就有警车护送。所以他扮演了一个非常不同的角色。然而，股价却低于开盘价。这让他非常沮丧。政治家会说我们不关注股价，但这并不完全正确，他们当然关注。看到你正在做的有价值的工作，而市场似乎对这项工作给予的价值却不高，这想必非常令人沮丧。所以一方面，那对他来说是一段非常重要的时期，对公司来说也是一段非常令人满意的时期，因为它在如此重大的问题上扮演了核心角色。但另一方面，也非常令人沮丧，因为股价是衡量成功的一种方式，而当这一切发生时，它却在一个非常低的价格徘徊。

He's got, you know, he he goes to, you know, the Baltics. He's getting police escorts from the airport. So, he kind of, you know, he's occupying this very different sort of role now.

**Amit:** 让我们谈谈蒂尔。你在书中花了很大篇幅谈论他与蒂尔和 Palantir 的关系。我早期在 YouTube 上做的一个关于这家公司的视频，早在 22 年，标题是“一个自由主义者和一个社会主义者不知何故创建了一家科技公司”。

你认为他们在早期为什么能够相处融洽？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. And that's where, you know, the real army that saw the value in Palantir, you know, to just buy more and see what was. Let's talk about Thiel. So he spent a good part of the book talking about the relationship with Thiel and Palantir and Karp. One of the first videos I did on YouTube when I was covering the company back in 22 was a libertarian and a socialist somehow create a tech company. Why do you think they were able to get along in the early days?</p>

**Michael:** 听着，他们在斯坦福法学院建立了友谊。他们都在 1989 年秋天进入斯坦福法学院，都是本科哲学专业。他们很快都发现自己不喜欢法学院。卡普说他一周内就知道这是个错误。蒂尔早期没那么挑剔，但他们都不太开心。所以他们因为对法学院的共同鄙视、对象棋的热爱以及对政治辩论的热爱而结下了不解之缘。他们在宿舍的闲聊堪称史诗级。他们都告诉我，卡普是左派，他是自由主义者，用卡普的话说，他们“像野兽一样争论”。但友谊就是从那时开始的。他们毕业后失去了联系。卡普去了德国攻读博士学位。几乎所有在斯坦福认识他们、知道卡普在做什么的人都说：“你为什么要这么做？太疯狂了。为什么不去从事法律事业？”蒂尔是唯一认为这是个好主意的人。他说：“哦，去吧。”所以他鼓励了他，但他们失去了联系。卡普回到美国后，他们在 2000 年代中期重新联系上了。他在旧金山的一个犹太慈善机构担任发展官员。他们重新联系，蒂尔来参加一个捐赠者会议。蒂尔向我解释说，卡普邀请他去，是因为他认为如果有一个非犹太人在场，可能会让气氛更文明一些。我不知道是不是这样，但蒂尔很快意识到他的朋友非常擅长筹款。

他非常擅长在房间里周旋。正如卡普在哈弗福德的另一位朋友对我说的，他的超能力是“读懂一个房间”。蒂尔也看到了这一点。蒂尔当时正在创办一家名为 Palantir 的公司。他有一些来自 PayPal 的人正在开发一个原型，并想为此筹集资金。所以他让卡普为他做一些兼职。然后，当然，他们在寻找 CEO。最初蒂尔认为需要一个前军方人士，一个在华盛顿有一定地位的人。他们面试了一些人，但都不太合适。与此同时，斯蒂芬·科恩（Stephen Cohen）、乔·朗斯代尔（Joe Lonsdale）和内森·盖廷斯（Nathan Gettings）正在与卡普合作，他们觉得，也许这个人就是了。他们去找蒂尔说，我们认为他就是。就这样，卡普成了 CEO。他的政治观点与蒂尔截然不同。他们在某些问题上比人们想象的更有共识，比如为什么公众对机构失去信心，高等教育的趋势等等。但在 Palantir 的大部分历史中，他们政治立场对立的事实是一个巨大的吸引力。他们之间的关系在科技界内外都引起了极大的兴趣。

他们政治立场对立的事实，在很多方面都对 Palantir 有利。因为人们看到这家在国家安全领域工作的公司，却有一个新社会主义者担任 CEO。所以，无论人们对蒂尔的观点有什么担忧——他变得越来越政治化，并表达了一些常常非常有争议的观点——有卡普担任 CEO 这个事实，在某种程度上消除了那些可能对 Palantir 持怀疑或批评态度的人的戒心。这软化了公司的形象，从这个意义上说，他作为 CEO 非常有用，这还不算他为这份工作带来的所有才能。就是这种与蒂尔的“阴阳”关系。他们是非常亲密的朋友。卡普说他认为他……因为在特朗普第一届总统任期内，蒂尔意识到他已经成了一个避雷针。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, listen, I mean they they they they formed this friendship at Stanford Law. They met at Stanford Law. Um they both had been philosophy majors as undergraduates. They they they matriculated to Stanford Law in the fall of 1992. No, fall of 1989, excuse me. So, right out of right after graduating, Peter Thiel from Stanford, Karp from Haverford. Um, and they both kind of quickly discovered that they don't love law school. Um, it's just not, you know, Karp said he knew within a week it had been a mistake. Thiel was a little, you know, less critical early on, but they're both not really happy there. So they bonded over their shared disdain for law school, their love of chess and their love of political combat and and their, you know, their their dorm room bull sessions were pretty epic. Um they both told me, I mean, you know, Karp had he was on the left, he was libertarian and um as Karp put it, you know, they argued like feral animals. Um but a friendship was born out of that and and and and and so you know they lost touch after um graduating from Stanford Law. Karp goes off to Germany to to pursue his doctorate. Um yeah almost everyone who was with them at Stanford who knew what Karp was doing was like why would you do that? That's nuts. Why aren't you going to pursue a legal career? Thiel was the only one who thought it was a good idea. He like oh go for it. And so you know he encouraged him but they lost touch. Then they reconnect after Karp comes back to the United States um you know in the early well mid two early 2000s and he's back in the United States and he takes a job uh as a development officer for a Jewish philanthropy in the in San Francisco and they reconnect um Thiel he has Thiel come to a meeting of donors um you know Thiel as Thiel explained to me it was you meeting of donors to this organization and Karp wanted invited Thiel there because he thought you Apparently, these donors would go after each other pretty hard during these meetings. And he thought if a a non-Jewish guy was there, it might make things a little more civil. Um I don't know if that's the case, but Thiel is very quick very quickly comes to realize that um his friend uh is really good at raising money um and and and and really good at working a room. Um, as another Karp friend, um, you know, from Haverford put it to me, his superpower is reading a room and and and Thiel sort of saw this. Um, Thiel's starting this company called Palantir. Um, and he's got, you know, some guys from PayPal and working on a prototype and, you know, wants to raise money for it. So, you know, he, you know, he gets Karp to do some moonlighting for him and and then, of course, you know, they're looking You know, initially Thiel thought it would have, you know, for for the CEO position, he thought they would need, you know, he thought it was someone ex-military, someone with some stature in Washington. Um, they interviewed some people, they just weren't great fits. Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings, meanwhile, are working, you know, with Karp and they're like, maybe this guy's it. And they go to to Thiel and say, you know, we think he's it. And that's how Karp became the CEO. And and, you know, his politics were very different than Thiel's. um they they they they they had you know more agreement than people might have realized about just you know you know you know about you know why the public was losing faith in institutions about trends in higher education so there were you know there were some they had you know similar views on some issues um but you know for most of Palantir's history the fact that they were political opposites was a source of great intrigue um this relationship between them was a source of a lot of intrigue you the tech community and beyond and and and and you know the fact that they were political opposites um accrued to Palantir's benefit in a lot of ways because um you know people were a lot you look at it and say okay this company working in the national security space but it's got this neo-socialist as a CEO and and and and you know so what you know whatever concerns people had about Thiel's views and he he he had become increasingly political and and and and had expressed views that were often quite controversial. The fact that you had Karp as the CEO kind of disarmed some of the people who who might have been suspicious of Palantir, might have been critical of it. Um it sort of softened the image of the company and in that sense he was very useful as a CEO. Um quite apart from all the talents he brought to the job. Um just this sort of you know yin-yang thing with Thiel. Um and and and you know they are very they're very close friends. Um and um you know Karp said that he considers him because during the first Trump presidency Thiel realized he had become a he was obviously a lightning rod.</p>

**Michael:** 这就是为什么他在特朗普 2.0 时期有所收敛。他意识到自己成了 Palantir 的公关负担，并在特朗普第一届总统任期早期提出，如果能让卡普和 Palantir 的日子好过些，他愿意辞去董事会职务。

卡普说：“门都没有。”首先，他希望蒂尔继续参与公司，认为他的建议非常宝贵。所以他希望他保留在公司的正式角色。但他也因为，在他看来，那将是极度的背叛。蒂尔把他带进了公司，蒂尔的支持对他作为 CEO 的成功至关重要。所以，他宁愿自己承担压力，也不愿抛弃他的朋友。但蒂尔确实给 Palantir 带来了很多争议，正如我们之前谈到的。所以，在特朗普第一届总统任期内，那种“好吧，他是左派，他是右派，Palantir 在中间，一切都好”的局面有点崩溃了。因为蒂尔在政治领域所做的一些事情与卡普所说的 Palantir 正在做的事情之间存在一些非常根本的差异。你有卡普说，“我们正在阻止极右翼掌权”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Michael: Which is why he kind of dialed it back in Trump 2.0. Well, he did, but I mean he realized that he had be that that that he had become a public relations liability for Palantir and he did offer early in the first Trump presidency to step down from the board if it would make things easier for Karp and Palantir and Karp said hell no. Um because you know first of all he he he want he wanted Thiel to remain involved with the company saw saw you know his council as invaluable. So and and and wanted him to retain that formal role with the company but he also because he it would have been an act of supreme betrayal in his mind. Um he you know he you know Thiel had brought him into the company right and Thiel's support you know had been absolutely critical to his success as CEO. He so he you know even you know he was more than happy to take the heat as opposed to throwing his friend overboard. Um and and and you know but it was you know Thiel I mean drew a lot of controversy to Palantir as we talked about earlier and and and and you know and and so you know the sort of you know the you was during that first Trump presidency when you know the sort of you know okay you know he's on the left he's on the right you know and and and and Palantir somewhere in the middle and it's all good that sort of collapsed a little bit it becomes you know a little harder to do that and and and and and because there were very there were very there were some very fundamental differences between what Thiel was doing in the polit in the political realm in those years and what Karp said Palantir was doing, you know, he you know, you have Karp saying, you know, we're keeping the far right out of power,</p>

**Amit:** 对吧？

**Michael:** 而蒂尔却在支持一些我认为很多人会说是极右翼的候选人。我甚至不单指特朗普。所以，事情就变得有点棘手了。但现在，我认为可以公平地说，卡普在一些重要问题上已经更接近蒂尔的世界观了。我认为他们在某些问题上的分歧变小了，尤其是在移民问题上。他们现在都再次支持特朗普。卡普第一次没有支持。蒂尔在特朗普第一届政府期间下船了，说他不会再支持他。我为这本书采访了他两次，总共谈了大约 5 个小时，那些谈话是在 2023 年春天，他说他不会再支持他了。但他又找到了回来的路。所以他们现在都再次支持了。

Um, but you know, it's it's it's it's it's a you know, and now I think you it's fair to say that Karp has moved closer to Thiel's worldview on some important issues. I think there's less daylight between them, certainly on an issue like immigration and, you know, they're both on board with Trump again after both, you know, Karp was not on board the first time. Thiel got to torture this metaphor. Thiel got off board during the first Trump administration, said he wasn't going to support him. You know, I interviewed him twice for the book. Uh we spent about 5 hours in total talking and those conversations were in the spring of 2023 and he said I'm not supporting him again and you know he found his way back and and and so you know they're both on board now again.</p>

### 哲人 CEO 的商业之道

**Amit:** 你如何看待卡普作为选股者和优秀投资者的能力？因为这方面蒂尔得到了所有的赞誉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: What is your perspective on him as a stock picker and a good investor? Because that's where Thiel gets all the credit.</p>

**Michael:** 卡普在这方面也不差。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Michael: Karp was not too bad at that.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 卡普相当不错。大家都知道这家伙懂得选股。他非常非常聪明，对这些事情非常精通。他知道如何处理钱。他懂得如何做生意，对投资似乎有敏锐的眼光。他知道如何……我不知道他经营 Palantir 的方式，他为 Palantir 带来的才能，是否让他成为一个好的选股者。我不知道这两件事是否相关，但他就是有一种感觉，知道谁属于哪里，他们应该从事什么项目，什么会成功，什么不会。我想，作为一个投资者，尽管他作为投资者的生涯不长，但他对什么能成功、增长前景是否真实、某只股票是否有很大的上涨空间有嗅觉。所以他在这方面表现得相当娴熟。但这并不是他特别想做的事，只是他当时在做的事。他并没有想过要创办对冲基金之类的。那不是他的世界。我其实不知道。他说他只是想赚到 25 万美元的储蓄，然后去柏林过上放荡不羁的生活。我不太相信，因为很重要的一点是，他的很多抱负都源于他觉得父母没有充分发挥他们的才能。这是一个有趣的家庭动态。他认为他的父亲，一位儿科医生，是一位非常有才华的临床医生和研究员，但没有凭借自己的能力在领域内获得应有的地位。他认为他的母亲是一位非常有才华的艺术家，但没有得到他认为她应得的认可。他认为他们的过度成就成了他对他们“未竟成就”的回应。所以我不太确定这是一个会满足于当个懒虫的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Karp was pretty good. I mean, word got around that this guy knew how to pick stocks. He's very he's look, he's very very smart, very sophisticated about this stuff. I mean, he is, you know, and he knows he knows how to handle money. I mean, let's let's just put it that way. I mean, he's, you know, he um you know, he knows how to do business. Um he's got a he he seems to have a keen eye for investment. Um, and I and and and he knows how to I mean I I don't know that I don't know that the way he runs Palantir, the talents he brings to to Palantir, I don't know that that made him a a good stock picker. I don't know that the two things are related, but you know, he just, you know, has, you know, he has a sense of where people belong, projects they should be working on, what's going to work, what's not going to work. And I suppose you know that you know as an investor and you know it wasn't a very long stint as an investor but I I I suppose he had a nose for you know what could work where the growth prospects were were they legitimate you know you know was there much upside to to a particular stock and and and so he proved to be quite adept at it um wasn't what he wanted to do particularly it was something he was just doing and and and he it's not like he had ambitions to be to start a hedge fund or anything like that that's not the world. I don't actually know that. I mean, he said that, you know, he just really wanted to make a $250,000 nest egg and go and, you know, live the life of a dilettante in Berlin. I don't really know if I believe that because, you know, it's important to understand that he um, you know, a lot of this stems from a lot of the ambition comes from the sense that his parents didn't fulfill their talent um, the degree that he thought they should have. And it's it's an interesting family dynamic. Um you know his he saw his father uh who's a a pediatric physician and he saw him as a very talented clinician and researcher who just you know didn't you know didn't achieve the stature in the field that he should have by dint of his ability. His mother he saw as a very talented artist who didn't get the recognition that he thought she deserved. and you know and and and and and what he saw you know again and you know he's you know it may sound harsh but he saw their his his overachievement became um overachievement became his answer to their underachievement to what he saw as underachievement. So I'm not entirely sure that this was a guy who's going to be happy as a slacker.</p>
</details>

**Amit:** 我不太相信。我认为这可能有点自我神话，只是为了强调他的成功是多么不可能。他无疑会成为一名成功的学者。成功总会找到他。但他最终领导一家大型科技公司，这可能不是他最明显的道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I'm not quite buying that. I think it may be a little bit of self-mythologizing just to underscore how improbable his success was. I mean, you know, he was going to he he was undoubtedly going to be he would have obviously been a successful academic. Success success would have found him, you know, somewhere. He would have found success. Um, but I think one can say that the fact that he's ended up heading a major tech company, that might not have been the most obvious path for him.</p>
</details>

### 哲学如何塑造商业

**Amit:** Palantir 的核心，卡普非常哲学地谈论**本体论**（Ontology: 在哲学中，是对存在、实在以及成为的本质的研究。在信息科学中，它指对某一领域内概念及其相互关系的明确的、形式化的规范说明），因为它是一个哲学术语。事实上，我之所以对 Palantir 感兴趣，部分原因是我在高中时学过哲学，本体论、大陆哲学、伊曼努尔·康德，我认识那个术语很多年了，然后我看到 Palantir 把他们的数据描述为一个系统的本体论结构。

你认为卡普是如何更广泛地将哲学思想与商业联系起来，以至于每个季度都会发布一份充满德国哲学家引言的股东信？有些人对此感到反感，觉得：“伙计，给我数字就行了，我不懂。”

但像我这样的很多散户投资者会觉得：“哦，天哪，他说话的方式几乎是深刻的，就像你一百年后会在哈佛商学院研究这些信件一样。”

你如何看待商业本身中的哲学？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: One thing that a lot of people have been uh trying to understand about Palantir is at its core, you know, Karp talks very philosophically about an ontology because it is a philosophical term. In fact, one of the reasons I got into Palantir is because I studied philosophy in high school and ontology, continental philosophy, Immanuel Kant, like I recognized that term for so many years and then I'm lurking at Palantir. Like they describe their data as an ontological structure of a system. Yeah. How do you think Karp has more broadly taken philosophical ideas and connected them to the business to the point where a shareholder letter comes out every quarter written with all these uh quotes from German philosophers. Some people are turned off by it like dude just give me the numbers I don't get. Yeah. Someone like me and a lot of other retail investors like oh my goodness he's speaking in a way that's almost prof almost like you would study these letters in a hundred years in Harvard school. How do you think about the philosophy in the business in of itself?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 我认为这是其中一个重要部分。听着，他没有计算机科学背景，但本体论是其中的一部分，这里存在重叠。工程师们思考组织数据和构建世界观的方式，对他来说并不是一个巨大的跨越。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, I think it's it's it's it's an important part of it. I mean, listen, I mean, you know, again, no background in computer science and yet, you know, there was this sort of this overlap with ontology being part of it. I mean, that, you know, the sort of, you know, the way that, you know, the the engineers thought about, you know, organizing data and and and and sort of constructing a worldview, you know, it wasn't that it wasn't as big of a leap for him.</p>

**Michael:** 你和那些早期的软件工程师交谈，比如 Aki Jain，他会说，卡普写作和思考的方式，即使他们说的语言不同，但卡普思考、说话和写作的方式有一种技术结构，能与他们产生共鸣。他们能看到与他们思考问题、解决问题、处理事情的方式非常相似的东西。所以在内部，这使得他能与这些人建立联系，他们也能与他建立联系。这可能并不明显。你可能会看着说，这家伙怎么能经营这家公司？他怎么能和这些软件工程师交谈？所以，他们并非来自完全不同的世界。显然，他来自人文学科背景。我认为这对 Palantir 非常有帮助，因为他能从更广阔的尺度上思考工作的意义，而你谈论的是一群年轻的软件工程师，他们只专注于编码。值得指出的是，我们现在都在谈论隐私、公民自由，这些在 Palantir 出现时是非常重要的讨论，因为那是在 9/11 和《爱国者法案》之后，这些都是真实的担忧。但那是在 iPhone 推出前几年，在个人数据爆炸之前。所以这些人在某些方面真的走在了时代的前面。卡普从一开始就对风险和重要性非常警觉，即创造强大的软件，但同时需要保护隐私和公民自由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michael: As it might have seemed. So and and and you talk to the you know you talk to you know you know some of the guy some of the software engineers who were there from the early days. Um Aki Jain for instance would say that you know the way he wrote the way he thought you know even if they were sort of you know talking different languages there was a sort of technical structure to the way Karp thought yes and talked and wrote that that that resonated with them. they could see something very similar to the how they thought about things, how they addressed problems, how they tackled things. So internally it was, you know, you know, there was, you know, a certain overlap there that that that, you know, that made it possible for him to connect with these people and they with him. Um, you know, that that that might not have been apparent. You just kind of look at this and say, how is this guy going to run this company? Um, so that you know, how's he going to talk to these software engineers? And so there was a sort you know you were not from completely different worlds and and and so and obviously you know look it it's you know he he comes from this background in the humanities. Um I think it was very helpful for Palantir in the sense that look he you know he he thinks this is someone who really could think through the implications of the work on a broader scale than you know you're talking about a bunch of young software engineers. I mean beside with coding I mean these are guys we're not thinking about you know it's important to point out that you know okay we now talk all about privacy civil liberties I mean those were very important discussions when Palantir came along because of course it was after 9/11 after the patriot act these are real concerns but I mean this was before I mean this a couple years before the iPhone is introduced I mean before you know just this explosion in in personal data so these guys are like really ahead of the curve in some ways and you know Karp was very uh alert from the start to the to the risks and to the to the importance of you know sort of you know creating this powerful software but you know also we need to do it in a way that can protect privacy and civil liberties and</p>

**Michael:** 这不会是一个完全邪恶的产品，而且有一个了解风险并想解决它们的人在掌控。当然，他思考问题的方式……他有一个想法，因为 9/11 之后的讨论，当蒂尔有了这个想法，“好吧，也许我们可以借鉴 PayPal 的经验，开发能帮助政府打击恐怖主义的软件”，利用他们已有的数据。卡普有一个想法，技术方面应该非常强大，帮助情报分析员在草堆里找到针，但我们如何在此过程中保护公民自由和隐私？卡普的想法是，对技术提出的问题，有一个技术性的解决方案。你可以在软件中嵌入这些控制。正如他所说，这是一种“黑格尔式的解决方案”。这两个看似对立的东西，你可以达到一种综合，生产出既能让分析员获得所需信息，又能保护数百万无辜者数据的软件，他们不应该被卷入这张大网。这是他的想法。我认为他把这看作是黑格尔式的解决方案，这可能有点简单化，但我想这就是他思考的方式，也是你可能看到他哲学背景从早期就发挥作用的地方。他是一位有资质的学者，曾与当今最著名的在世哲学家尤尔根·哈贝马斯（Jürgen Habermas）共事过一段时间。

**Amit:** 我认为他肯定感到非常被证明是正确的，而且他现在正高兴地庆祝胜利，并且不会停止。他多年来一直对机构投资者持负面看法，这可以追溯到他在沙山路（Sand Hill Road）为 Palantir 筹集资金时受到的冷遇。他们基本上都拒绝了，有些人的态度比其他人好一些。所以这让他对机构投资者产生了一些敌意，这种敌意后来延伸到了华尔街分析师身上，尤其是在公司上市后。听着，当时股价表现不佳。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. Well, I think he certainly, you know, feels very vindicated and, you know, he is, you know, he is happily spiking the football these days and he's not going to stop. um you know he's like you know he was very mean you know he's had a he's you know he is you know been down on institutional investors um for many many years this goes back to the rough reception he received on Sand Hill Road you know when you know going out to try to raise money for Palantir and basically they all said no some were nicer about it than others and so that kind of you know you gave him you know some hostility towards institutional investors that then carried over to Wall Street analysts certainly after the company goes public. And listen, the stock was not doing well.</p>

**Michael:** 是的。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Yeah.</p>

**Amit:** 公司还没有盈利。你已经经营了 18 年，仍然没有盈利。所以，这种怀疑并非完全没有根据，但他觉得，与你这样的人相比，华尔街分析师不了解 Palantir，也永远不会了解，他已经懒得向他们解释了。所以现在他正处于一种庆祝胜利的状态，他感到自己被证明是正确的，而且我猜他暂时还不会停止嘲讽他们。但我也想说，他相信 Palantir 最好的日子还在后头。他现在已经 50 多岁了，还保持着疯狂的日程安排。是的，从某种意义上说，这对他来说更容易，因为他没有妻子和孩子，所以他可以这样生活，但这仍然是一个相当繁重的时间表。他很少在同一个地方睡超过一两个晚上，总是在路上。

但我认为这是因为他热爱他所做的事情。这家公司是他一生的事业。我也认为，因为他相信，最好的还在后头，他想亲眼见证。尽管他喜欢在越野滑雪道上，但我认为他觉得，花了 20 年才走到这一步，最好的还在后头，他想亲眼见证。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Company hadn't turned a profit. You're 18 years in and it still hasn't turned a profit. And so, you know, it's not like the skepticism was totally unfounded, but you know, he felt that in contrast to people like you, Wall Street analyst, didn't understand Palantir and we're never going to understand it and he was done trying to explain it to them. So there is this victory lap that you know he's sort of on now and then he feels vindicated and you know he's you know he's not going to stop dunking on them for a while yet is my guess. But I would also say that you know I think he believes that Palantir's best days are still to come. I mean you know because the thing is you know it's like look at he's he's in his late 50s now. He's keeping up this crazy schedule and yeah, he can it's easier for him in a sense because he doesn't have a wife and kids and so he can live like this, but it's still a a pretty backbreaking schedule. I mean, he's rarely in the same bed, you know, more than one, you know, one or two nights at any time on the road constantly. But I think it's because he loves what he does. I mean, this company is his life's work. And I also think because he believes, you know, the desk the the best is is still to come for Palantir and he wants to be there for it. You know, as much as he likes to be out in the cross country skiing trails, I don't, you know, you know, I think he thinks, you know, it's 20 years to get to this point, he feels like, you know, you know, the the best is is is is still to happen and and and he wants to be there for it.</p>

**Amit:** 最后一个问题，迈克尔。再次感谢你今天花时间和我在一起。我昨晚看到了这个，我不知道该不该说谢谢，但我妈妈肯定很高兴。我不知道我的名字会出现在书里。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Last question for you, Michael. Again, thank you for all the time you spent with me today. Uh, so I saw this last night and I was uh well I I I don't know if I should say thank you, but uh my my mom was definitely pretty happy about this. I didn't know my name would be in the book.</p>

**Amit:** 它在后记里。你写得完全正确。你十二月那个下午到达时，卡普和我正在交谈。所以，首先，能看到我的名字被这样一本书永垂不朽，对我来说真的很酷。所以我确实要感谢你。这对我意义重大。我想，我之所以能出现在那里让你写下那个情景，唯一的原因是公司拥抱了散户投资者。

<p class="english-text">Amit: It is there in the epilogue. And uh what you wrote is exactly correct. When you arrived that uh that afternoon in December, Karp and I were in conversation and um you know then another person came up. And so first of all, it was just really cool for me to to see my name get immortalized in a book like this. And so I do thank you for that. That means a lot. And I guess the the only reason I was there for you to even write about that situation is because the company has embraced the retail investor and uh you know particular</p>

**Michael:** 你是……很明显，在 Palantir 的散户投资者中，你是最知名的。你象征着……因为这是故事中一个非常重要的部分。

**Amit:** 这正是我要问的问题，你认为为什么散户投资者会拥抱 Palantir？这是我最后一个问题。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Which was going to be my question by the way why do you think the retail investor embraces Palantir that's my last question.</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，因为我认为他们觉得他是一个真实的人物，一个……他们觉得他很有趣，他在电视上很风趣，他想什么就说什么。所以有真实性这个因素。他会说，他们理解 Palantir 的故事，而分析师们不理解。他们以一种非常简单的方式理解。这家公司是站在美国和西方一边的，他们希望看到它成功，并愿意把钱投在他们的情感所在之处，相信公司会成功，相信他对公司在做什么、在哪里看到机会的解释。在一个机构投资者持怀疑态度、华尔街分析师非常怀疑的时期，有这样一个散户投资者社区，他们说“卡普爸爸”、“卡普爹地”，诸如此类，他喜欢这个。他觉得这很可爱。

除了自我满足之外，更重要的是，有这样一个投资者社区，他们相信这个故事。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well because I think I think they find him to be a an authentic figure a figure of of you know they find him entertaining he's very funny you see him on TV he just says what he thinks so there's the authenticity factor and I He would say that they understood the Palantir story in a way that analysts didn't. I mean, you know, and they understood in a very simple way. This is the company on the side of the United States and the West and and and and and they wanted to see it succeed and and and and you know, were willing to put their money where their where their sentiments lay and and and and you know, and and and you know, believe that the company would succeed and um you know, bought his you know, explanation for you know, what the company was doing um you know, where where it saw opportunities. And and I think you know it's you know at a time when institutional investors were skeptical, Wall Street analysts were very skeptical. You know there was this community of of of retail investors who you know said Papa Karp, Daddy Karp, all that sort of stuff and just you know he liked that. He found that, you know, very endearing and um excuse me, he he found that very appealing and um more importantly than just the the the the ego gratification, it was, you know, the fact that there was this community of investors who who bought the story.</p>

**Michael:** 他们说，好吧，是的，现在股价是七八块，但我认为它会涨。我认为这其中有东西。使用该软件的组织都对它赞不绝口。你们知道，当空客有 4 万人每天使用这个软件时，这个产品就是合法的。

Um I think there is something to this. um you know companies that you know organizations that use the software swear by it. I mean, you know, you guys knew in a way that, you know, you knew I mean, when you've got 40,000 people at Airbus using the software on a daily basis, product is legit,</p>

**Michael:** 即使华尔街分析师们在打折或没有给予应有的重视，但有一个投资社区明白，这是一个相当大的成就，这不仅说明了软件的质量，也说明了这项技术的潜力。如果它对一家大型公司如此重要，如果它对美国军方如此重要，那么这里有很大的上升空间。值得在 7、8、15、25 美元，甚至 100 美元时投入一些资金。

<p class="english-text">Michael: And and and you know, and and and even if you know, Wall Street analysts were were discounting that or just not paying it, you know, giving it the the weight it deserved, there was an investment community that understood that that's a pretty significant achievement and that spoke not just to the quality of the software, but to the potential for this technology. um that if it did if it it was that integral, if it had become that integral to a major major corporation and if it was that integral to the US military that there was a lot of upside here. Um and and and and you know that it was worth putting some of your money in at 7, 8, 15, 25, $100.</p>

**Michael:** 所以我认为那是很大一部分原因。显然，你作为一个非常公开地支持的人出现了。你看，在财报电话会议上，他想听的是散户投资者的声音。是的。他会把麦克风递给几个华尔街分析师，几个投行分析师，但主要是散户投资者。他说，当公司进入标普 500 指数时，他发布了那个视频，他说这属于两个群体：Palantir 的员工和我们的散户投资者。

I mean you know it's it's the retail investors he wants to hear from. Yeah. He'll throw the mic to a few, you know, Wall Street analysts, a few investment bank analysts, but it's the retail investors and and and he says, you know, and you know, this is, you know, he says now, I mean, when he, you know, talked, you know, when the company was in, you know, you know, got into the S&P 500, he releases that video and he said this belongs to two groups, Palantirians and our retail investors,</p>

**Amit:** 好的，迈克尔，最后一个问题。你希望人们在阅读这本书的整个生命周期中，能从中得到什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, Michael, last question for you. What do you want people to take away from the book over the lifetime of people reading it?</p>
</details>

**Michael:** 嗯，我认为有几点。我认为这是一个非常有趣的商业故事。你不仅能从公司现在拥有巨大估值的事实中看到这一点，还能从它所催生的事物中看到。从 Palantir 出来的公司数量，尤其是在国防科技领域的兴趣爆炸式增长，Palantir 为此铺平了道路。所以现在每个人都在谈论国防科技，转向爱国资本，这简直就是 Palantir 的产物。三位联合创始人来自 Palantir。所以 Palantir 的影响不容小觑。你看到其他科技公司现在也在拥抱前置部署模式。OpenAI 等等，这并非始于 Palantir，但他们重新定义了这个角色，现在你看到其他公司说，这实际上很有道理，派工程师出去与客户合作，不是问“你的业务能适应我们的软件吗”，而是“我们的软件能适应你的业务吗？”这看起来很基本，但 Palantir 为此铺平了道路。所以这是一个相当惊人的商业故事。当然，这个商业故事最惊人的方面是，这个没有商业背景、没有计算机科学背景的人，成功地将这家公司带到了 4000 亿美元的估值。这是一个非凡的商业故事。你也可以说，在商业政治方面，如果你想理解我们所处的这个时代，这本书值得一读。Palantir 现在处于一切的中心。想想过去 10 个月里主导头条新闻的事情：ICE、以色列、人工智能。

它处于一切的中心。如果你想理解这个时代，你需要了解一些关于 Palantir 的事情。而如果不了解其掌舵人这个非常特立独行和复杂的人物——亚历克斯·卡普，你就无法理解 Palantir。所以，我认为，运气比能力更重要，这本书的时机真的很好。我只想说，他政治上的演变，无论他是完全 MAGA 化了，还是四分之三 MAGA 化了，这都是一个非常有趣的演变，也是这个时代的故事之一，即硅谷如何转向特朗普，以及这次对特朗普的拥抱。

卡普是那个故事的一部分，一个主要部分，但我认为他走向那里的旅程比其他一些人物更有趣、更有启发性。正如我所说，如果你想理解我们正在经历的这个时代，如果我可以谦虚地说，这本书是一个很好的方式。

<p class="english-text">Michael: Well, I think there are a couple different things. I think it's I mean, I think it's a really interesting business story. I mean you and and you can see you know you know the importance of this as a business story not just in the fact that it's you know the company has this you know you know this massive valuation now but in what what it has spawned I mean the number of companies that have come out of Palantir and you can also see it in in the the the explosion in interest in defense tech I mean Palantir paved the way for that so you know now everyone talks about defense tech the pivot to patriotic capital and which is quite literally the spawn of Palantir. I mean three of the co-founders coming out of Palantir. So I mean this is you know Palantir's impact um you know cannot be overstated at this point. You see other companies now other tech companies embracing the forward deployed model. Open AI and others, you know, it didn't begin with Palantir, but they sort of reinvented this role and and and now you see, you know, other companies saying, you know, this actually makes sense, sending engineers out to work with clients and finding out not what, you know, what you know, can you can you can your business be bent to our software, but can our software be bent to your business, right? And you know, it seems kind of fundamental, but Palantir paved the way for that. So, it's a quite amazing business story. And of course, the most amazing aspect of the business story is the fact that this guy with no background in business, no background in computer science has successfully led this company to a $400 billion valuation. And um that's a remarkable business story. I think you can also say that um you know to to to on the business political front um if you want to understand the moment we're living in um this is a book worth reading. Um and and and you know uh Palantir is at the center of everything right now. Um you think about the things that have dominated the headlines over the last 10 months. You know ICE, Israel, AI is in all of this. It's at the center of everything. I think if you want to understand, you know, you want to understand this moment, you need to know something about Palantir. And you cannot understand Palantir without understanding this very idiosyncratic and complex figure at its helm, Alex Karp. So I think, you know, this is, you know, I think it's it's, you know, it's better to be lucky than good. And I think the timing is really good for this book, I think. And then um you know I would just say that you know it's it's you know I think you know how he arrived at you know his evolution politically whether he's gone full MAGA or three-quarters MAGA or what have you. you know, this has been a very interesting evolution and and and and and one of the stories of this moment is how, you know, Silicon Valley, you know, turned to Trump and and and it's embrace of Trump this time and Karp's part of that story, a major part of that story, but I think his journey there is is a lot more interesting and and a lot more revealing than perhaps some of these other figures. And I think, you know, you, as I said, you want to understand the moment we're living through. Um, I I I I think I think this book, if I can say in all modesty, is a good way of doing that.</p>
