### 序言：从葡萄酒评论到解读硅谷哲人

**Amit Kukreja:** 大家好，欢迎回到频道。今天我请到了一位非常特别的嘉宾，Michael Steinberger，来讨论他的新书《硅谷哲人》。Michael，感谢你的到来。

<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Alright. Hello everybody. Welcome back to the channel. I'm here today with a very, very special guest, Michael Steinberger, to discuss "The Philosopher in the Valley," his latest book. Michael, thanks for being here.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 很荣幸能和你交流。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** It's a pleasure to be with you.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这将是一次非常激动人心的对话，因为我一直是 Palantir 的粉丝，对这家公司很着迷。我的很多观众显然也很关心这家公司，它已经发展出了一个相当庞大的散户股东基础。而你基本上写了一本关于 Karp 的生平以及 Palantir 故事的书。因此，我认为这本书的由来以及你为何选择这个主题，其中有很多不同的细微之处值得探讨。我想从这个问题开始：你曾在 2002 年到 2011 年间担任网络杂志《Slate》的葡萄酒专栏作家。

关于葡萄酒，有趣的是，我不是一个葡萄酒爱好者，但从我那些喝葡萄酒的朋友那里了解到，人们品酒、分析、闻香的方式带有一种特定的精神层面，葡萄酒这个概念充满了各种细微的差别。你写了一本关于一个非常神秘的人物的书，可以说，要理解 Alex Karp 这位“硅谷哲人”，需要进行大量的心理分析。你认为你十年撰写葡萄酒评论的经历，是否影响了你写作 Alex Karp 的方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** This is going to be a really exciting conversation because I have been a fan of Palantir for a long time. I've been intrigued by the company. A lot of my audience has obviously cared about the company. The company's developed a pretty significant retail shareholder base, and you essentially did a book on the life of Karp but also the story of Palantir. So I think there's a lot of different nuances to get into in terms of how this book even came to be and why you chose to write about this subject. I want to start with this question to get things rolling. You served as a wine columnist for the internet magazine Slate from 2002 to 2011.

And the interesting thing about wine, I'm not the biggest wine drinker, but from my friends who do drink wine, there's a certain spiritual way that people like to drink and analyze and smell, and there's all this nuance to the concept of wine. You wrote a book about someone who is very enigmatic, and one could argue there's a lot of psychoanalysis that comes to understand the philosopher in the valley that is Alex Karp. Do you think your 10 years of writing about wine kind of influenced how you approached writing about Alex Karp?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是个很好的问题，我其实没这么想过。有趣的是，他（Karp）经常提起我写葡萄酒评论的背景。事实上，他曾指出，这就像……他会提到一种葡萄，然后说，即使你不喜欢这种特定的葡萄，你似乎也能相当公正地去写它。我曾经写过一篇文章表达我对长相思（Sauvignon Blanc）的鄙视，我不认为长相思的粉丝会觉得那篇文章特别公平。但不管怎样，Karp 认为我能够以一种不偏不倚的态度来写作，把我的个人感情放在一边。至于写葡萄酒是否为写这本书做了很好的准备，也许吧。葡萄酒是一个复杂的主题，有很多维度。你处理的是一个人们有强烈情感、关乎个人品味的东西。

也许在某种我没有完全理解的方式上，这为我写作像 Karp 这样复杂且与众不同的人物做了不错的准备。他在全球商业舞台上确实与众不同，他身上有很多维度，这在其他更标准的 CEO 身上或许是找不到的。所以，我想这其中确实有些关联。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** It's a great question and I hadn't actually thought of that. It's interesting. He brings up my background with wine writing quite often. In fact, he says, he's made points that, it's just like, talking about, he'll reference, he'll say a grape, and he said, if you don't like, even if you don't like this particular grape, you seem able to write about it quite fairly. And I once wrote a piece expressing my disdain for Sauvignon Blanc. I don't think Sauvignon Blanc fans would think that piece was particularly fair. But nevertheless, Karp thought I was able to write about things with a certain even-handedness, putting my feelings aside. As for whether writing about wine was good preparation for this, maybe. I mean, wine is a complicated subject. There are a lot of dimensions to it. You're also dealing with something where people have strong feelings. It's a matter of personal taste.

And maybe in some way that I didn't quite understand, there was decent preparation for writing about someone as complex and different as Karp. He is something different on the global business scene, and there are dimensions to him that you perhaps don't find in other more standard CEOs. So I think there's something to it.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 是的，我认为很多散户投资者之所以对 Karp 产生兴趣，就是因为他非常有趣，即使在公司股价表现不佳的时候也是如此。很多人喜欢听他说话。你书中的一个主旨是，你注意到 Karp 有一种让别人听他说话的能力，即使他们并不同意他的观点。我认为这是任何领导者最难建立的能力之一——让人们关心他们要说的话，因为它迫使人们在某种程度上认为，“这个人很重要，也许我们应该认真对待他。”在商业世界里，这可能意味着数十亿甚至数百亿美元的收入。我们来谈谈你和 Karp 最初是如何认识的。书中一个主要角色是哈弗福德学院（Haverford College），你们俩实际上是同班同学。那里只有大约 1500 名学生，但你们直到几十年后才重新联系上。你能讲讲你们是如何认识的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Yeah. I mean, I think one of the reasons why a lot of retail investors became intrigued with Karp is because of how interesting he was, even when the company stock price was not performing. A lot of people like to listen to what he had to say. And one of the sort of major themes in your book is that you noticed Karp has a way to get other people to listen to him even if they don't agree with him. And that I think is one of the hardest things for any leader to be able to establish: the ability to get people to care about what they have to say because it forces some level of, "Hey, this person matters. Maybe we should take them seriously." In the business world, that could result in potentially billions and billions of dollars of revenue. Let's get into how you and Karp originally met. So, one of the main characters I would say of the book is Haverford College where you both actually went to the same class. There's only about 1500 students there, but you didn't end up reconnecting until decades later. Can you kind of tell the story of how you got to know him?</p>
</details>

### 两个未曾交谈的同班同学

**Michael Steinberger:** 嗯，事情比那更夸张。我们都在费城郊外那所小型的文理学院上学。一个年级不到 400 人。我们在那里待了四年，却从未说过一句话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, it's even more than that. We went to this small liberal arts school outside of Philadelphia. A class size of fewer than 400 people. We spent four years there and never once exchanged a word.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Wow.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这本身就是一种成就。我完全不知道那是怎么发生的。我想他……他总是轻描淡写自己在那儿有多努力，但我认为他相当用功。我敢肯定，图书馆见到他的次数比见到我的次数多，这或许在某种程度上解释了为什么他最终成了亿万富翁，而我没有。

但这很奇怪，因为比如说，我的妻子去了布林茅尔学院（Bryn Mawr College），而哈弗福德和布林茅尔关系非常密切，就像兄弟姐妹学校一样。哈弗福德是完全男女同校的，它在 1980 年，也就是我们入学前几年，就实现了完全男女同校。

它们仍然保持着非常紧密的联系。我妻子认识他。我们有共同的朋友。但不知何故，我和他就是从未有过交集，从未在那里说过一句话。

时间快进到这么多年后，我开始知道 Palantir 这家公司，也知道了它的 CEO，然后发现，哦，他是我在哈弗福德的同班同学。真有意思。如果我说当我看到他的照片时，我想起来“哦，我记得那家伙”，那我就是在撒谎，因为事实并非如此。总之，我后来成了《纽约时报杂志》的撰稿人，我已经不再写葡萄酒，开始为《纽约时报杂志》写一些非葡萄酒主题的文章。当时我认为 Palantir 会是一个非常引人入胜的故事。很重要的一点是，我们之前没有任何关系，因为杂志社是不会派给我这个任务的，那会构成利益冲突。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** That's a kind of achievement in itself. I have no idea how that happened. I think he was, he downplays how hard he worked there, but I think he worked pretty hard. I am quite certain the library saw more of him than it saw of me, which perhaps goes some way to explaining how he ended up a billionaire and I didn't.

But it's very strange because for instance my wife went to Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford and Bryn Mawr are very close. They're like brother and sister schools. Haverford's fully co-ed. It went fully co-ed in 1980, so a few years before we got there.

They still keep very close ties. My wife knew him. We had mutual friends. Somehow he and I just never connected, never exchanged a word there.

And so cut to all these years later. I had become aware of Palantir and had become aware of its CEO and, oh, he was in my class at Haverford. Interesting. And if I'd be lying if I said when I saw pictures of him that I was like, "Oh, I remember that guy," because that's just not true. Anyway, so I had become a writer for The New York Times magazine. I had moved on from wine and started writing about non-wine subjects for The New York Times magazine. And I thought Palantir would be a really compelling story. And it's important that we did not have any prior relationship because the magazine would not have assigned it, because that would have been a conflict of interest.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Right.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我们第一次见面是在 2019 年，是一次非正式的谈话，他当时在评估我，决定是否要配合一篇杂志特稿。我们聊了聊那些我们从未共同经历过的旧时光。从那以后，他同意配合杂志的报道。我在 2019 年到 2020 年期间报道了这个故事。文章发表于 2020 年，就在 Palantir 上市几周后。

那是一篇相当全面的文章，有 9000 字，篇幅很长。但尽管如此全面，我感觉还有很多话要说。

在报道过程中，我花了很多时间和他在一起，对他非常着迷。我认为他的故事和 Palantir 的故事还有更多值得挖掘的地方。因此，文章发表大约一年后，我和他谈了写一本书的可能性。我认为关于 Palantir，有一本既及时又重要的书值得去写。我到他在新罕布什尔州的住处去见他，我们谈了这件事，他同意了。所以整件事就是这样发生的。他同意合作。

我想他之所以合作有几个不同的原因。他当时认为，关于 Palantir 的书迟早会有人写，所以与一位作家合作是明智的。他认为《纽约时报杂志》那篇报道很公正，很好地捕捉到了他是谁以及他如何看待这个世界。所以，与一个他曾经合作过的人再次合作是合理的。我认为另一个让他对写书感兴趣的因素是，公司已经上市，Palantir 是一个成功的故事，他希望被认可为这个成功背后的驱动力。因为，作为一个像你一样密切关注这家公司的人，你知道，即使到今天，你仍然会看到很多文章的标题是“彼得·蒂尔的 Palantir”。这几乎成了一种习惯，尤其是在特朗普的第一个总统任期内，几乎每篇文章都称之为“蒂尔的 Palantir”，尽管彼得从未参与 Palantir 的日常运营。他是董事会主席，但真正经营公司的是 Alex Karp。我认为 Karp 对此并非心怀怨恨，但他希望被承认为那个将这家公司打造成成功故事的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** We met for the first time in 2019, an off-the-record conversation where he was kind of sizing me up and deciding whether he wanted to cooperate on a magazine feature. And we reminisced a bit about old times we never shared, and from that, he agreed to cooperate on the story for the magazine. And I reported that story through 2019 and into 2020. It was published in 2020, a few weeks after Palantir went public.

And then, it was a pretty comprehensive article. It was 9,000 words, which is a lot of words. But as comprehensive as it was, it felt like there was still a lot more to say.

I had spent a lot of time with him reporting the story, was very intrigued by him. I thought there was more to his story and more to the Palantir story. And so about a year after the article came out, I talked to him about the possibility of doing a book. I thought there was a timely and important book to be written about Palantir and went up to see him at his place in New Hampshire and we talked about it and he was on board with it. So that's kind of how this whole thing happened. And he agreed to cooperate.

Yeah, I think he cooperated for a couple of different reasons. He assumed at that point that a book would be written about Palantir and he thought it made sense to cooperate with a writer. He thought the Times magazine story was fair. He thought it did a good job of capturing who he was and how he thought about the world. So it made sense to cooperate with someone he had worked with before. And I think the other factor that interested him in having a book written was because, look, he had taken the company public and Palantir was a success story and he wanted to be recognized as the driving force behind that success. Because as someone who's followed the company as closely as you have, you know even to this day you see a lot of articles, the headline in stories about Palantir was "Peter Thiel's Palantir." And that was almost like a tic during the first Trump presidency. Almost every article was "Thiel's Palantir," even though Peter never had any involvement with the day-to-day workings of Palantir. He was chairman of the board, but it was Alex, it was Karp who was running the company. And I think he wanted—it wasn't a source of resentment for Karp—but I think he wanted to be recognized as the person who had built this company into the success story that it had become.</p>
</details>

### 为何渴望成为“主角”？

**Amit Kukreja:** 他想要一点主角光环。关于他的过去有很多可以深入探讨的地方，但从宏观层面来看，你认为除了他是 CEO、负责公司日常运营这些显而易见的原因之外，为什么 Karp 想要被认可为主角？他想被看作那个关键人物，背后是否有更深层次的原因？因为现在，他客观上就是那个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** He wanted a bit of the main character energy. There's a lot to dive into in terms of his past life, but at a high level, why do you think Karp wanted to be recognized as the main character, outside of the obvious—he's the CEO, he's responsible for the company actually getting to where it is on a day-to-day basis? But was there something deeper for why he wanted to be seen as that guy? Because now he objectively is that guy.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 是的。听着，当你处于他这样的位置时，你不可能缺乏自尊。我认为，将公司上市并成功挂牌，绝对是一件非常非常重大的事情，而且花了很长时间才走到这一步。我想，纯粹地……我不想说这是自负，但我认为他希望自己的成功得到承认。

他觉得他通往硅谷的道路非常不可思议。所以我认为，他当然认识到自己有一个非常有趣的故事。

而且，在某些方面，Palantir 本身就是一个非常不可能的成功故事。

所以我认为他只是渴望看到这个故事被讲述出来。他知道总有一天会有人以书的形式来讲述它。于是，我恰好出现在他在新罕布什尔州的门口，说：“嘿，我想接下这个任务。”他考虑了一下，然后同意合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think it's, yeah. Listen, you can't be lacking in self-regard when you are in a position like this. And I think certainly taking this company public, having a successful public listing was a huge, huge thing. And it had taken a long time to get to that point. And I think, just pure, and I don't want to say it's ego, but I think he wanted to have his success acknowledged.

He felt that his path to Silicon Valley was a very improbable one. So I think he recognized certainly that he had a very interesting story.

And Palantir was just a very unlikely success in some ways.

And so I think he just was eager to see that story told. He knew it was going to be told in book form by someone at some time. And so I happened to show up on his doorstep in New Hampshire and said, "Hey, I would like to take this on." And he thought about it and then agreed to cooperate.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 你认为如果你们不是校友，他还会合作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Do you think if you guys didn't go to the same school, he would have not cooperated?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是个好问题。我认为，听着，哈弗福德的这层关系……他们在 2019 年的时候并不怎么接受媒体采访。所以我认为哈弗福德的这层关系——我不能百分之百确定——但我想这层关系让他足够感兴趣，愿意和我见个面，讨论我为杂志社想做的那个报道。我认为哈弗福德的校友关系在这方面起了作用。但我不认为这和写书有任何关系，尽管哈弗福德在书中占有非常重要的位置，原因可能哈弗福德本身不会太喜欢。但我认为这和书关系不大，但可能与他愿意考虑配合《纽约时报杂志》的报道有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** That's a good question. I think, listen, I think the Haverford connection... they weren't doing a lot of press back in 2019. So I think the Haverford connection—I don't know this to be absolutely the case—but I think the Haverford connection intrigued him enough that he was willing to take a meeting with me to discuss the story I was interested in doing for the magazine. I think the Haverford connection helped in that regard. I don't think it had anything to do with the book. Though Haverford figures very prominently in the book for reasons that Haverford may not entirely love. But I don't think it had much to do with the book, but it may have had something to do with his willingness to entertain the possibility of cooperating on the Times magazine story.</p>
</details>

### Karp 的 formative years：身份认同与挑战

**Amit Kukreja:** 好的。那我们来深入聊聊 Alex Karp 和他的早年生活，然后再谈到他转向 Palantir 的过程。你在书中重点突出了两个要素，那就是他的混血身份和他的学习障碍——**阅读障碍症**（Dyslexia: 一种常见的学习障碍，主要特征是阅读和书写困难）。我想先从混血身份谈起，然后再谈阅读障碍。我接触到的 Palantir 社区里，很多人甚至不知道 Karp 有一半黑人血统。

很多人甚至不知道他是犹太人。所以，跨种族身份本身就有很多细微的差别。再加上从宗教角度看的犹太成分。你如何看待 Karp 对自己混血身份的看法？你认为这种身份在他的职业生涯中是推动了他，还是给他带来了不利？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Right. Okay. So let's dive deeper into Alex Karp and his early life and then we'll get into the transition to Palantir. So, there's two elements of the book that you highlighted pretty well, which was his biracial identity and his learning disability, which was dyslexia. I want to start with the biracial identity, and then we'll work our way towards the dyslexia. A lot of people in the Palantir community that I speak to don't even know that Karp is half black.

Many of them don't even know he's Jewish. And so, there's a variety of nuance to the concept of being interracial in and of itself. And then on top of that, adding the Jewish component to it from a religious perspective. What is your perspective on how Karp thought of himself being biracial? And how do you think that identity either propelled him or provided him a disadvantage over the course of his career?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我会这么说。我认为他很早就明白，身为混血、身为犹太人、患有严重的阅读障碍，这些在生活中都不是优势。这些是他面临的不利条件。

种族主义无疑是一个因素，尽管他说他从未亲身经历过。但他肯定知道这是美国生活中的一个主要因素，也是他所生活的世界的一部分。当然，反犹主义在历史上也一直是一股重要的力量。所以他很早就明白，在他看来，自己有一些不利条件。对于 Palantir，我想你必须理解他的一点，这一点可能在电视上或他的公开言论中不那么明显，那就是他从小就有一种脆弱感。

这是因为他的身份。他并不认为这是负担，只是明白种族主义和反犹主义是生活中的现实因素，是他可能面临的事情。我认为这种脆弱感一直伴随着他直到今天。对于 Palantir，我确实认为他参与这家公司、并带领它走向成功的动机之一，在某种意义上，是在他心目中为 Alex Karp 创造一个更安全的世界。

现在谈论这个可能有点奇怪，因为他已经是一个拥有庞大安保团队的亿万富翁了。他还有什么好怕的呢？但我认为那种脆弱感一直伴随着他。它推动了 Palantir 的许多决策，那种他一直以来都怀有的恐惧感。所以，我认为这或许是思考他的混血背景和身份的一种方式，即它在某种意义上是 Palantir 之所以成为今天的样子的一个内在组成部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** You know, I would say this. I think he understood early on that being biracial, being Jewish, being severely dyslexic, were not advantages in life. That's, there were strikes against him.

Racism was certainly a factor, though he says he never experienced racism itself. He certainly knew that it was a major factor in American life and just part of the world in which he lived. And certainly anti-semitism was a significant force throughout history. So he kind of understood early on that he had some strikes against him as he perceived it. And with Palantir, I think the thing you have to understand with him, and maybe it doesn't come across when he's on television or in his public pronouncements, but I think he's had a sense of vulnerability from a quite young age.

Because of his identity, he didn't consider it a burden, but just understood that racism and anti-semitism were factors in life, were things he might face in life. And I think there was a sense of vulnerability that has stuck with him to the present day. And with Palantir, I do think part of the motivation for getting involved with this company, for seeing this company through to success, was in some sense he was making the world safe for Alex Karp in his mind.

Right? I think that is a... it's a strange thing to say now about a guy who is a multi-billionaire, has a big security detail. It's like, what does he have to fear? But I think that sense of vulnerability has stuck with him. It propels a lot of the decision-making of Palantir, the fear that he has always had. And so I think this is kind of the way one might think about his biracial background and his identity, that it is integral to what Palantir became in a sense.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 书中有一段引述，Karp 对他兄弟说，他兄弟更关注家庭的黑人血统，而 Karp 则较少关注。你认为 Karp 为什么较少关注这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** There is a quote in the book from Karp saying to his brother that he focused more on the family's blackness and Karp focused less on it. Why do you think Karp focused less on it?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是个很好的问题。他的兄弟给了我很多时间，非常慷慨地分享了他的时间、想法和回忆，并且详细地讲述了家族历史。他说，在高中和大学时期，以及他在哈弗福德认识他的大学朋友们（不像我），都证实了这一点：他非常认同自己的黑人传统。他的兄弟说，在高中时，他是一个年轻的黑人。这种情况一直持续到哈弗福德时期。他非常积极地参与那里的黑人学生组织。事实上，在我们大四那年，他帮助组织了一场在耶鲁大学举行的反种族主义会议，并被《底特律自由报》引用。该报不久后就大学校园的种族主义问题做了一篇大篇幅报道，他在报道中谈到种族主义是多么普遍等等。

所以，有趣的是，他到了 Palantir 之后，直到公司成立多年后，他才告诉公司里的任何人他母亲是黑人。

正如你所说，他在某个时候对他的兄弟说，这已经是他在 Palantir 取得成功之后很久的事了，他们进行了一次对话，他对兄弟说：“你把黑人身份调高了，而我把它调低了。”我在书中没有对原因做任何推测。我真的觉得，因为这是一个相当敏感的领域，涉及到身份认同以及你如何看待这些事情。我非常满足于将这些信息呈现出来，让读者自己得出结论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** It's a great question. Now, his brother, who gave me a lot of time, was very, very generous with his time and his thoughts and his recollections, and really laid out the family history. He said that in high school and in college, and college friends, people at Haverford who knew him, unlike me, substantiated this: he very much identified with his black heritage. His brother said in high school he was a young black man, and that continued through Haverford. He was very involved with the black student organization there. In fact, our senior year, he helped organize an anti-racism conference that was held at Yale University, I believe, and was quoted in the Detroit Free Press, which did a big article not long thereafter about racism on college campuses, and he's talking about how prevalent racism is and so forth.

So, it is interesting that he gets to Palantir and it's not until many years after the company started that he told anyone at the company that his mother was black.

And as you said, he tells his brother at some point, this is well into, he's now with Palantir, company success, and they have a conversation and he said to his brother, "You've dialed up the blackness and I've dialed it back." I did not offer any speculation in the book about why that is. I really felt, because this is kind of fraught terrain. It's matters of identity and how you think about these things. And I was very content to put this information in there and to let the reader draw his or her own conclusion.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我确实认为书里有一部分，Karp 在你们的对话中提到，他没有经历过一个百分之百的黑人男性所经历的那种痛苦。这其中有很多细微的差别，涉及到世界如何看待 Karp，或者世界如何不看待 Karp。最重要的是，基于 Karp 多年来的演变，尽管我认为这一点从他还是学生时就一直如此，他更关心的是**精英**（Meritocracy: 一种认为社会地位应由个人才能和成就决定的理念），而不是多元化、公平和包容的立场。你认为是不是因为这个原因，他不想因为自己的黑人身份而被区别对待，无论是更好还是更坏，所以他专注于成为最好的自己，而不是成为“黑人中的最好的”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Well, I do think there is one part of the book where Karp mentions to you in your conversations that he is not going through the same types of pain that a full 100% you could say black man is going through, not biracial. And there's a lot of different nuance to that just in terms of how the world perceives Karp or how the world doesn't perceive Karp. And on top of that, based on how Karp has evolved over the years, even though I think this has been pretty true since he was a student, meritocracy is what he cares about a lot more than the sort of diversity, equity, inclusion standpoint. Do you think because of that he didn't want to be treated as someone better or worse because of his blackness, which is why he focused on just being the best versus being the black best?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 嗯，他觉得他不会被黑人社区接受为他们的一员。我认为这是一个问题。而且他的经历确实不同。他说他从未感受过种族主义的刺痛。所以，如果他声称自己有过那样的经历，或者说他体验生活的方式和其他黑人一样，那对他来说就是欺骗。他说那不是他的经历，他也没有以任何方式否认他的黑人传统。他说他为此感到自豪，这对他很重要，但他也觉得，如果他站出来说“我是黑人”，并把这作为他身份的核心，黑人社区不会接受，这会对人们造成冒犯。所以这是他的解释，解释为什么他没有像现在他的犹太身份那样，将黑人身份置于生活的中心。这是不同的，他给出了这些理由。正如我所说，身份认同，尤其是在当下这个时刻，是一个敏感的话题，人们会得出自己的结论。我真的很想看看读者对此的反应，他们会如何解读，以及他们如何看待他的轨迹——他的兄弟说他在高中和大学时是一个年轻的黑人，而现在，他强调的是犹太人的一面，而且犹太人的一面显然对他更重要。

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I mean, he feels that he doesn't feel that he would be accepted by the black community as one of their own. I think that is one issue. And his experience has been different. I mean, he has said he has never felt the sting of racism. So it would be fraudulent of him to claim that he's had this or that he's experienced life the way other black people have experienced life. He just says that's not been my experience and he doesn't disavow in any way his black heritage. He says he's proud of it. And that it's important to him, but he also feels that if he went out there and said, "I'm black," and put that at the center of his identity, that the black community would not accept it, that it would be offensive to people. And so this is his explanation for why he's not centering it in his life in the way that his Jewishness is now very much centered. It's different and he, these are the reasons he offers. And as I said, identity is, particularly in this particular moment, it's a fraught topic and people are going to draw their own conclusions. And I'm really interested to see how readers react to this and what they make of it and what they make of his trajectory and the fact that his brother says in high school and in college he was a young black man and now it's the Jewish side that he emphasizes and the Jewish side that clearly matters more to him.</p>

### 阅读障碍：障碍还是武器？

**Amit Kukreja:** 学习障碍呢？我的意思是，这家伙有阅读障碍，却拿到了新古典主义理论的博士学位。你和 Karp 关于学习障碍的对话，如何让你对他作为一个企业家、领导者、最终是创始人的看法更加深刻？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Learning disability, how do you think... I mean, this guy got a PhD in neoclassical theory while having dyslexia. How did your conversations around that learning disability with Karp accentuate how you think of him as an entrepreneur, leader, ultimately founder?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 他说，接续我们关于身份认同的对话，阅读障碍才是他生命中真正的障碍，而不是种族主义。他从未经历过种族主义，阅读障碍才是真正的障碍。用他自己丰富多彩的表达方式来说，他说：“它搞砸了我，但给了我飞翔的翅膀。”

有趣的是，我以前不知道，但有研究和文章指出，不成比例的 CEO 和成功企业家似乎都患有阅读障碍。我不知道具体比例，但比如理查德·布兰森（Richard Branson）就有阅读障碍，著名的律师大卫·博伊斯（David Boies）也是，现在还有 Karp。我们所知道的，以及 Karp 向我解释并有研究证实的是，阅读障碍者有几个特点。

其一，他们在任何特定时刻能处理的信息量都不如其他人，所以他们依靠更少的信息来应对。这可以让他们根据已有的信息更快地采取行动。他当然是这么觉得的。所以他可以根据更少的信息做出决定、得出结论，这使他能够更果断、更迅速地行动。他认为这对他在 CEO 职位上取得的成功至关重要。

另一个因素是，阅读障碍是一种残疾，你需要别人的帮助。你不能完全自力更生。当你开始创办一家公司时，你必须授权，必须让其他人参与进来。这不像“我，我自己，和我自己”那样。我想，对于很多公司，特别是当你有企业家、有创始人时，人们会认为这是他们的心血，他们在情感上和经济上都投入其中，所以他们可能很难下放责任。但像 Karp 这样的人，他习惯于需要帮助，所以他习惯于团队合作，习惯于授权，习惯于利用他人的长处。这是他作为阅读障碍者成长过程中就具备的。所以，他相信这使他成为一个更有效的领导者，并且对 Palantir 的成功起到了绝对关键的作用。

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, he says, picking up from the conversation about identity, he says, look, dyslexia was the real hurdle in his life, not racism. He never experienced racism. Dyslexia was the real hurdle. And as he puts it, he's got a very colorful way of expressing himself. He said, "It [fucked] me, but gave me wings to fly."

And what was very interesting, and I did not know this, but there have been studies and articles written, a disproportionate number of CEOs and successful entrepreneurs seem to be dyslexic. I don't know what the percentage is, but like Richard Branson for instance is dyslexic, the famed attorney David Boies, and then now Karp. And what we know and what Karp explained to me, and research has borne this out, there's a couple of things about dyslexics.

One, they can't process as much information in any given moment as other people, so they get by on less information. And that can lead to being able to act more quickly on the information they have. And that's certainly the way he feels. So he can make decisions, reach conclusions based on less information, which enables him to act more decisively, more quickly and decisively. And he thinks that has been absolutely integral to the success he's had as a CEO.

The other factor is, dyslexics, it is a disability and you need help from other people. You can't have this sort of... self-reliance is not something you can really have. And when you get into building a company, you have to delegate, you have to get other people involved. It's not this "me, myself, and I." I think with a lot of companies, particularly when you have entrepreneurs, you have founders, one would assume this is their baby. They are emotionally and financially invested in it, and it's probably really hard for them to delegate responsibility. And in the case of someone like Karp, he is used to having, because he needed help before, and so he's used to the idea of working as a team and of delegating authority and of drawing on the strengths of other people. It's something that he grew up with as a dyslexic. So, he believes that this has made him a more effective leader and has been absolutely integral to Palantir's success.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 你认为他是否几乎把它看作是一种让他与众不同的武器？Karp 是一个不害怕与众不同的人，他甚至很喜欢自己与众不同。你认为阅读障碍让他与传统学者如此不同，以至于为了在学术界生存，他必须付出双倍的努力，这最终也影响了他在 Palantir 的生活吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Do you think that he almost sees it as a weapon that allows him to differentiate himself? I mean, Karp is someone who is not afraid to be different. He kind of really likes the fact that he's different. Do you think dyslexia makes him so different from a traditional academic that for him to survive in academia he had to work twice as hard, which ultimately implicated his life in Palantir?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我不确定这一点，但我知道，很明显，他有这种学习障碍，却能在哈弗福德取得优异成绩，然后去了斯坦福法学院，又在法兰克福大学获得了博士学位。有这种障碍还能做到这些，这令人印象深刻。尽管他轻描淡写自己有多努力，但我可以想象，在某些时候，他付出了巨大的努力。

我不知道这如何转化为他在 Palantir 的表现，但他私下里和同事们肯定会说，阅读障碍是一个非常非常大的因素，也是让他成为一个与众不同的领导者的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** You know, I don't know about that, but I mean, I do know, obviously, just the fact that he had this learning disability and then goes on to... I mean, he crushes it at Haverford, he goes on to Stanford Law, and then he goes and earns a doctorate at Goethe University Frankfurt. I mean, with this disability, that's impressive. And as much as he downplays how hard he worked, I would imagine it was some herculean efforts at points because of this.

I don't know that how this translates to Palantir, but privately and with his colleagues, he will certainly say that dyslexia is a very, very big factor and one of the things that has differentiated him as a leader.</p>

### 解码 Palantir：公众的误解与现实

**Amit Kukreja:** 好的，我们来谈谈一些关于 Palantir 的话题，然后再回到 Karp 本人。我想从这个问题开始：你认为普通公众对 Palantir 技术的实际作用有不公正的理解吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Okay. So, let's get into some of the conversation on Palantir and then we'll get back to Karp himself. Let's start with this question and then we'll go from there. Do you think people in the general public have an unfair understanding of what Palantir's technology actually does?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我认为存在误解。你和我一样清楚，Palantir 这个名字现在几乎成了监视（surveillance）的同义词。而我书的副标题对此并没有什么帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** I think there are misconceptions. I mean, you know as well as I do that the name Palantir is now almost synonymous with surveillance. And I'm not helping that with the subtitle of my book.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这其实让我有点惊讶。我不知道那会是副标题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Which actually was a bit surprising to me. I didn't know that was going to be the subtitle.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 嗯，我要告诉你，Palantir 的人，Karp 已经看过这本书了，其他人也看过了，他们对此并不高兴。我认为他们不是一家监视技术公司，但他们所做的部分工作确实可以促成监视。他们的软件可以帮助情报机构工作。而且很明显，这家公司成立时部分资金来自**In-Q-Tel**（In-Q-Tel: 美国中央情报局（CIA）旗下的非营利性风险投资公司，旨在投资和支持开发对国家安全有用的创新技术），所以我不认为他们能轻易地否认与监视的关联或担忧。但我确实认为存在一些根本性的误解，我希望这本书能澄清一些，比如人们总是想当然地认为他们收集数据、存储数据。

向普通读者和公众传达“他们不这么做”这一点非常重要。他们的软件是帮助组织更好地利用自己的数据。

为什么这一点还没有被大众所理解呢？嗯，Palantir 只是在最近几年才变得家喻户晓。以前人们最多只是模糊地熟悉它。当我开始写这本书的时候，很多人都问：“嗯？他是谁？Palantir 是什么？”在过去三年里，情况显然发生了变化，股价从每股 10 美元涨到近 200 美元，这起了很大作用。

所以现在认知度更高了。但人们对他们做什么有更好的理解了吗？也许在边缘地带有所改善，但我认为很多人仍然错误地认为这是一家收集和存储数据的公司。这无疑与 Facebook、Google 等公司有关，它们确实收集数据，你的数据就是它们的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, you know, I will tell you, people at Palantir, Karp has seen the book, and other people have seen it and they're not thrilled about that. I think it is, they're not a surveillance technology company, but part of the work they do can enable surveillance. They can facilitate surveillance. Their software can help intelligence services with their work. And obviously, it was a company that was founded in part with an investment from In-Q-Tel, so I don't think they can really disavow the surveillance connection or concern that easily. But I do think there are some fundamental misconceptions. And one of the things I hope obviously with this book is that it'll clear up some fundamental misconceptions, such as, you see it all the time, people just assume that they collect the data, they store the data.

And it is obviously very important to get across that point to general interest readers, to the public, that that's not what they do. It is software that enables organizations to make better use of their own data.

And why this hasn't penetrated with much of the public, it seems? Well, I mean, listen, Palantir only in the last few years has it become something like a household name. People were at best vaguely familiar with it. And when I started writing the book, lots of people were like, "Huh? Who's he? What's Palantir?" That has changed obviously just in the last three years. Going from $10 a share to almost $200 will do that.

So there's greater recognition now. Is there better understanding of what they do? Maybe at the margins, but I think a lot of people still labor under the misconception that this is a company that collects the data, stores the data. And part of this is undoubtedly tied to Facebook, Google, I mean, which collect data. The business is, your data is their business.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这就是另一回事了。你在书中多次提到 Karp 对这些消费者互联网公司的鄙视。你认为为什么人们会很快地说 Palantir 是会窃取你数据的邪恶怪物，却不知道这根本不是他们做的事；而 Facebook 每年却能从你的数据中赚取数千亿美元的收入？为什么会有这种二分法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Well, that's the other thing. I mean, you talk a lot about in the book how Karp has the disdain for some of these consumer internet companies. Why do you think generally people are very quick to say Palantir is the evil boogeyman that's going to steal your data, not knowing that that's quite literally not what they do, but Facebook quite literally makes hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue per year. Why is there that dichotomy?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 他很早就认识到并理解了 Facebook 和 Google 的业务性质。他也看到这可能对 Palantir 产生非常负面的影响，他们可能会被混为一谈。

他明白灾难随时可能发生，尤其是在 Facebook 身上，而灾难确实发生了。数据被操纵、被抓取等等。所以他理解这其中的风险，也明白任何在这个领域运营的公司都有可能被卷入一场普遍的抵制浪潮中。因此，他对 Facebook 和 Google 的担忧是完全合理的。所以他竭尽全力试图将自己区分开来。当然，这也加剧了他对 Facebook 的敌意，他称其为“致癌物”和“寄生业务”。他想明确表示，Palantir 是不同的。那为什么 Palantir 会被单独挑出来呢？嗯，这是因为它合作的对象。

这是无法回避的。你与情报机构合作，你与**ICE**（U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局，负责执行移民和海关法律的联邦机构）合作。在特朗普的第一个任期内，他指出 Palantir 并不是唯一与 ICE 合作的科技公司。当然，在特朗普的第一个总统任期内，一个复杂的因素是蒂尔。

他为 Palantir 吸引了很多关注。如果蒂尔没有与公司关联，Palantir 在特朗普第一个任期内还会这么有争议吗？可能不会。但话说回来，公司与秘密机构合作，与执法部门合作，与 ICE 合作。所以从这个意义上说，争议对于 Palantir 来说是不可避免的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, he recognized early on, he understood the nature of Facebook's business, the nature of Google's business. And he also saw that this could have very negative implications for Palantir. They could get lumped in.

He understood that there was just disaster waiting to happen, certainly with Facebook, and it did happen. Data was manipulated, data was scraped, and all that sort of stuff. So he understood the risks with this, and he also understood that any company operating in this area was in danger of being swept up in a generalized backlash against it. And so that was a very legitimate concern that he had vis-à-vis Facebook certainly, and Google as well. And so he went to great lengths to try to differentiate himself. And of course, this also fed his hostility towards Facebook, which he describes as a carcinogen and a parasitic business. He wanted to make clear that Palantir was different. Now, why does Palantir get singled out? Well, it's because of who it works with.

And there's no getting around that. You work with intelligence services. You work with ICE. During the first Trump administration, he made the point that Palantir was not the only tech firm working with ICE. And then the complicating factor there certainly during the first Trump presidency was Thiel.

I mean, he drew a lot of attention to Palantir. Would Palantir have been so controversial during the first Trump presidency if Thiel hadn't been associated with the company? Probably not. But again, it works with clandestine services, it works with law enforcement, works with ICE. So in that sense, controversy was inevitable with Palantir.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 是的，这也是我过去几年报道这家公司时一直在努力解决的问题。我几乎把它看作一个挑战，去纠正那些试图通过说 Palantir 做了这个、做了那个来贬低它的人。我客观上不反对听取关于 Palantir 做什么或不做什么的不同观点。但作为一个真正研究过其软件架构的人，我觉得事实并非如此。即使是与英国国家医疗服务体系（NHS）的合同，那也是一个非常有争议的合同，但他们最终拿下了。一年半后，你看到了结果，积压的工作减少了。所以你开始问自己，英国的那些人更关心叙事，还是更关心拥有更好的医疗保健？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Yeah, and you know, it's something that I've struggled with over the past couple years covering the company, and struggled in the sense of I've almost seen it as a challenge of correcting the people that would try to dunk on Palantir by saying they do this, they do that. And I'm like, look, I'm objectively not opposed to hearing a different perspective on what Palantir does or what they don't do. But as someone who's actually studied the architecture of the software, it just doesn't feel like that's necessarily what's going on here. Even with the NHS contract, that was a very controversial contract that they ended up achieving. You're seeing the results a year and a half later of backlogs being reduced. And so you start asking yourself, do these people in the UK care more about the narrative, or do they care more about having better healthcare?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是个很好的问题。在书中，我当然提到了 NHS，但你看 Palantir 在疫情期间所做的工作。

关于当时发生的事情，有很多误解，我试图在讨论中澄清。比如，所有人都说没有大合同，这又是特朗普给蒂尔的某种好处，但事实并非如此。Palantir 为努力控制病毒传播以及后来的疫苗推广做出了宝贵的贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, and that's a great question. And in the book I talk, I mentioned, of course, the NHS, but look at the work that Palantir did during the pandemic.

And there's a lot of misconception which I've tried to clear up in that discussion about what went on then. All talk, no big contracts, and that this is somehow another sop to Thiel from Trump, and it was none of those things. And Palantir made an invaluable contribution to the effort to try to get some handle on the spread of the virus and then of course the vaccine rollout.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 实际上是黛博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）说我们需要帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** It was quite literally Deborah Birx saying we need help.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我们需要帮助。这和特朗普毫无关系。正如一位 Palantir 高管在谈到特朗普第一个总统任期内的另一个问题时对我说的：“特朗普连 Palantir 怎么拼都不知道。”也许他现在知道了。但话说回来，这些叙事已经形成并根深蒂固。比如我们之前谈到的，它仍然被称为“蒂尔的 Palantir”。你几乎总是在任何关于 Palantir 的文章中看到“神秘的”这个词。

但他们对我非常开放，让我接触任何我需要的人。Karp 给了我非凡的接触机会。而且，你看一下他们的网站，上面有大量的信息。你可以通过访问他们的网站了解很多关于 Palantir 的事情。

过去他们确实更守口如瓶，现在对某些事情仍然守口如瓶。比如他们不能谈论与秘密机构的合作以及一些军事工作。但我认为，“神秘的”这个描述真的不再适用了。但这些说法就是这样，它们会自己生长。我希望在书中成功传达的一点是，这是一家复杂的公司，涉及很多不同的事情。有些事情你应该关注，有些事情他们可以被批评，但任何公正的描述都必须承认，他们也做了一些非常有益的事情，疫情就是一个例子。至于英国的反应，我认为很大程度上与围绕蒂尔的争议有关。他在那件事上没有帮上忙。我记得他去牛津大学辩论社演讲，说英国人对 NHS 的依恋是一种**斯德哥尔摩综合症**（Stockholm syndrome: 指受害者对加害者产生情感，甚至反过来帮助加害者的一种情结）。

这并没有赢得多少英国人的好感。最近，当然，在英国也出现了真正的抵制，因为公司对以色列的支持。

但这是 Palantir 持续面临的挑战。如何让人们承认你做的好事，即使公司的其他方面让他们觉得不那么值得称赞并引发争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** We need help. It was nothing to do with Trump. As someone, a Palantir executive, said to me in the context of another issue during the first Trump presidency, he said, "Trump wouldn't know how to spell Palantir." Maybe he does now. But again, there are these narratives, and narratives sort of take hold. I mean, for instance, just stepping back, we talked earlier, it's still referred to as "Thiel's Palantir." You still see almost always in any article about Palantir "secretive."

But, you know, they were very open with me, gave me access to anyone I needed. Karp gave me extraordinary access. But, you know, I think you take a look at the website, there is a hell of a lot of information on their website. You can learn a lot about Palantir by just going to their website.

They were more tight-lipped in the past, and they are still tight-lipped about some things. There are things they can't talk about, work with the clandestine services and so forth, and some of the military work. But I think the "secretive" description really no longer applies. But again, these things just kind of take on a life of their own. And one of the points I think I've succeeded in conveying in this book and I hope I've conveyed is that, look, it's a complicated company. It's involved in so many different things. There are things you should be concerned about. There are things they can be criticized for, but any fair-minded account of what this company does must also acknowledge that there are things that they have done that have been enormously beneficial, and the pandemic was one example of this. And then, the reaction in the UK, I think it's a lot of this is bound up in the controversy over Thiel. He didn't help in that case. He goes and gives a talk at the Oxford Union, as I recall, and says that Britain's attachment to the NHS is a form of Stockholm syndrome.

That did not win over many people in the UK. So, and more recently, of course, in the UK, there's been real pushback because of the support the company's given to Israel.

But this is something they have to, this is an ongoing challenge for Palantir. Sort of, how do you get people to acknowledge the good work, even if there are other aspects of what the company does that they regard as not so laudable and that do cause controversy.</p>
</details>

### 强大软件的政治迷宫

**Amit Kukreja:** 我想我们都会同意，而且我认为 Karp 也多次说过，如果 Palantir 的软件和技术落入坏人之手，它会非常强大、有用，可以被用于各种坏事。你认为这也增加了公司的神秘感吗？如果软件落入坏人之手，会被用于非常糟糕的方面，以至于人们几乎期望并希望软件能像 Karp 所说的那样，一直留在西方的盟友手中，这样至少软件有一个比落入俄罗斯或中国手中更宏大的北极星。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** I think we would both agree, and I think Karp has said this many times, that if Palantir was in the hands of the wrong people, the software and technology is so profoundly incredible and useful and powerful that it could be used in a myriad of bad ways. Do you think that also implicates the mystique around the company, that if the software was in the wrong hands it would be used in such bad ways that people are almost expecting and hoping that the software continuously stays in the allies of the West, as Karp would say, so that the software at least has a broader north star than the hands of Russia or China?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 是的。当我 2019 年、2020 年为《纽约时报杂志》写报道时，很明显，关于 Palantir 有两种相互矛盾的叙事，而且我认为至今仍然如此。一种是，这是一种无所不能、极其危险的技术。另一种是，尤其是在公司上市时，你看到很多文章对它的技术到底有多好表示怀疑，说它基本上是烟雾弹。

通常，这些事情的答案是真相在中间。但实际上，真相可能是，它确实是相当强大的软件。我曾把它描述为“有碎木机一样的效率和橡皮泥一样的可塑性”。我不知道 Palantir 的人是否会用这些确切的比喻，但根据与客户的交谈，情况确实如此。

一位客户告诉我，这就像看到了《黑客帝国》里的矩阵。

用过它的人都对它赞不绝口。他们认为它比市场上任何其他产品都高出一筹。所以它确实很强大。我想稍微换个说法，这里不可避免地要谈到政治。我认为，很多人从特朗普的第一个总统任期中学到的一个教训是——而且我认为第二个特朗普总统任期在某些方面是不同的——但很多人学到的教训是，如此强大的技术在一个威权政权手中可能成为一个非常有用的工具。我不是在评论特朗普，而是一个更普遍的评论。

这将是一个威权政权手中的非常强大的工具。Karp 的反驳会是：“看，我们有这些隐私控制，我们认真对待公民自由。”他们确实如此，这是绝对真实的。但最终决定如何严格使用这些隐私控制和护栏的是最终用户。

确实有过滥用的例子，但这与 Palantir 无关。他们销售软件，但并不监控其使用情况，当然不是每天都监控。所以存在风险，Karp 对此一直非常坦率。他们没有卖给沙特阿拉伯。奥巴马政府在“阿拉伯之春”期间曾表示有兴趣让他们把技术卖给沙特，因为担心沙特政权的稳定。

但他们因为沙特的人权记录而选择不这么做，Karp 不想助长任何侵犯人权的行为。所以他们过去确实因为担心软件可能被如何使用而拒绝过潜在客户。我认为，对于如此强大的技术，这始终是一个危险，无论是在企业端还是政府端，都存在滥用的可能性，而且是大量滥用的可能性。他们的软件在不同地方处理大量个人数据，无论是在商业领域还是政府领域。人们必须对这些风险保持高度警惕，他们也确实如此，但最终，是客户做决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, yeah. I mean, I think what was interesting, it was clear to me when I was doing the story for the Times magazine back in 2019, 2020, and I think it persists to this day, there's been like two conflicting narratives about Palantir. Is this all-powerful, dangerous as hell technology? And there's other, certainly when the company was going public, you saw a lot of stuff expressing skepticism about just how good it was, that people saying, "Oh, it's just basically a lot of smoke and mirrors."

Usually the answer to these things is the truth is somewhere in the middle. Actually, the truth is probably it is pretty powerful software. The way I've described it is it's got the efficiency of a wood chipper and the malleability of Play-Doh. I don't know if people at Palantir would use those exact analogies, but from talking to customers...

One customer told me it's like looking into the Matrix.

Yeah. Those who use it swear by it. And they think it is just heads and shoulders above anything that they can get elsewhere in the market. And so it is powerful. And I would rephrase it slightly, and there's no avoiding politics, but I would say, one of the lessons that I think a lot of people took from the first Trump presidency was... and I think this second Trump presidency is different in some ways, but the lesson was for many people that technology this powerful could be a very useful tool in the hands of an authoritarian regime. And that's not, I'm not commenting on Trump so much as just as a more general comment.

This would be a very powerful tool in the hands of an authoritarian regime. Karp's retort, if he were part of this conversation, would be like, "Look, we've got these privacy controls, we take civil liberties seriously." And they do, that is absolutely true. But as you know, it's the end user in the end who decides how rigorously to use those privacy controls, to use those guardrails.

And there have been instances where stuff has been abused, and it has nothing to do with Palantir. They sell their software, they don't monitor how it's used, certainly not on a daily basis. So there is risk, and Karp has been very upfront about this. And they've not sold to some... they didn't sell to Saudi Arabia. The Obama administration expressed some interest in having them sell the technology to Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring because there were fears about the stability of the Saudi regime.

They chose not to do it because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, and Karp did not want to contribute to any human rights abuses. So they do, in the past, have turned down potential customers because of concerns about how it might be used. And I think that is always the danger with technology that is this powerful, that whether it's on the corporate side or the government side, there is the potential for abuse and for a lot of abuse. And there's a lot of personal data that flows through their software in different places, whether on the commercial side or in the government space. And one has to be very alert to these risks, and they are, but at the end of the day, it's the customer who decides.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 让我们转到政治话题，因为我认为这也非常重要。你刚才说奥巴马政府曾考虑让 Palantir 把软件卖给沙特阿拉伯，而 Karp 拒绝了。这暗示他们与美国政府合作了很长时间，他们曾与奥巴马政府合作。

据我了解，奥巴马 2.0 驱逐的人比川普 1.0 多，但 Palantir 却在川普 1.0 时期名声很差。你认为为什么一个与政府合作的公司，无论执政的是民主党还是共和党，现在却被视为川普法西斯主义的邪恶威权工具？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** So, let's just transition into the political conversation because I think this is also really important. You just said that the Obama administration was thinking of telling Palantir to sell their software to Saudi Arabia and Karp said no. Which implies that they've been working with the US government for a long time. They were working with the Obama administration.

Uh, from my understanding, Obama 2.0 deported more people than Trump 1.0, but Palantir gets a pretty bad rap, especially in Trump 1.0. Why do you think a company that has worked with the government, whether it was a Democrat or Republican in office, is now being seen as the evil authoritarian use of Trump's fascism?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是一个复杂的问题。回到特朗普的第一个总统任期，正如你所指出的，他们与 ICE 的关系始于 2014 年奥巴马执政时期。

当时这并没有引起争议，而奥巴马当时也驱逐了很多人。我认为是特朗普的言论，以及他任内的一些做法，比如儿童与父母分离的政策，让人们感到不满。所以，特朗普任内做的一些事情与奥巴马时期是不同的。这是一方面。但我也认为，你不能低估“蒂尔效应”。彼得·蒂尔是特朗普在硅谷最大的支持者，可能也是 2016 年商界最大的支持者。

他不是一个受欢迎的人物，所以很多事情都是通过这个棱镜来看待的。

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, you know, it's a complicated question. I would say going back to the first Trump presidency, listen, as you noted, the relationship with ICE began in 2014 under Obama.

It wasn't controversial then, and Obama was deporting a lot of people. I think it was Trump's rhetoric and I think it was some of the stuff that was done, the child separation policy, that did not sit well with people. So, there was stuff that was done under Trump that was different than what was being done under Obama. So, that's one thing. But I also think, look, you can't downplay the Thiel effect. Peter Thiel was Trump's biggest supporter in Silicon Valley and probably the biggest supporter in the business community in 2016.

And he was not a popular figure, and so a lot of this was seen through that prism.</p>

**Amit Kukreja:** 所以这更多是叙事而非现实？因为如果他们做的是同样的工作，是的，有些事情不同，但人们现在想把 Palantir 与邪恶联系起来，更多的是因为他们对特朗普的厌恶，你会这么说吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Yeah. So, so it was a bit more narrative than reality because if they're doing the same work and yes, there are some things that are different, but people want to now associate Palantir with evilness. It's more so their disdain for Trump, you would say?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 这是很大一部分原因。不过我也会说，他们因为不想与特朗普的移民政策扯上关系，早期曾强调他们是与 HSI（国土安全调查局）合作，而不是与执法和遣返部门合作。但后来这种区分有点站不住脚了，因为 HSI 也参与了一些突袭行动，然后他们说：“是的，Palantir 的软件在其中发挥了作用，但只是很小的作用。”所以，我认为他们通过否认与移民镇压有任何联系，而实际上软件确实在其中扮演了某种角色，从而在某种程度上伤害了自己。再说一次，不管大家对移民、对无证人员有什么看法，从我的角度来看，特朗普第一个总统任期内做的一些事，比如将孩子与父母分开，而且很多家庭至今未能团聚，这是很难辩护的政策。

为它辩护不是 Palantir 的角色，但如果你以任何方式牵涉其中，你也会受到一些抨击。但我也认为，Karp 在 2019 年与我多次谈到这一点，他指出其他科技公司也在与 ICE 合作，但他们却没有受到抗议。针对 Palantir 的行动并没有针对其他公司。一方面，他把这看作是一种变相的恭维，觉得这在某种程度上默认了他们的软件确实很好，但另一方面，这也让他非常生气，因为他们单单挑出了 Palantir。我认为部分原因是因为 Palantir 与秘密机构合作，并且毫不掩饰其与政府在一些让人们担忧的领域合作的热情，但另一个重要原因还是因为彼得·蒂尔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** That's a big part of it though. I mean, I will also say that they, because they didn't want to be associated with Trump's immigration policy, they emphasized early on that we work with HSI. We're not working with the other side, enforcement and removal. And so they were saying that publicly, and then that distinction kind of collapsed because HSI was involved in some raids and then they said, "Yeah, Palantir software is playing a part, but it's a very minimal part." So, I think they sort of hurt themselves there a bit by just disavowing any connection with the immigration crackdown when in fact the software was playing some role in it. And again, however everyone feels about immigration, how everyone feels about undocumented people, from my point of view, there was stuff done during the first Trump presidency. I mean, separating children from their parents, and a lot of kids, a lot of families haven't been reunited still. That's a hard policy to defend.

And it's not Palantir's role to defend it, but if you're in any way implicated in that, you're going to take some slings and arrows too. So, but I also think, and Karp, we had a lot of conversations back in 2019 about this, and he made the point that other technology companies were working with ICE and yet they weren't being protested. The program that was directed at Palantir wasn't being directed at others. And, on the one hand, he took it as a backhanded compliment. He's like, it was sort of a tacit acknowledgement that the software was really good, but it also really pissed him off because they were singling out Palantir. And I think part of it is because Palantir worked with the clandestine services, made no bones about its enthusiasm for working with the government and in areas that kind of gave people some concern, but also again, a big part of it was because of Peter Thiel.</p>

### Karp 的政治演变与“特朗普紊乱综合症”

**Amit Kukreja:** 我听说 Karp 在过去一年开始强调一个观点，即在我们正在谈论的移民问题上，边境管制很重要，拥有一个安全可靠的边境是一个国家主权的基石。他将其与德国正在发生的事情以及我们所看到的情况进行比较，认为这对西方不一定是最好的事情。几天前，Axios 发表了一篇文章，标题是“Karp 已完全 MAGA 化”。Karp 对此回应说，写这篇文章的人，也就是写了这本书的你，充满了**TDS**（Trump Derangement Syndrome: 特朗普紊乱综合症，一个用来嘲讽那些对特朗普有非理性负面反应的人的贬义词），尽管你是个好人。所以，我想直接问你这个问题。你正在谈论移民和边境，如果 Karp 现在在这场对话中，他会说，一个健康的边境确实很重要，这无关政治，这只是关于我们是否希望非法移民抢走工作岗位之类的问题。

你有 TDS 吗？这是否影响了你的写作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Well, so I've heard Karp over the past year start to stress the idea that, on the topic of immigration that we're speaking of, border control matters and having a safe and secure border is the fabric for the sovereignty of your country. And he compares it to what's going on in Germany and things that we're seeing and how it's not necessarily the best thing for the West. An article came out on Axios a couple of days ago that was titled "Karp has gone full MAGA." And Karp responded to this by saying the person who wrote the article, who also wrote the book, is filled with TDS, even though you're a good person. So, so, so just straight up I want to ask you the question. You're talking about immigration and borders and if Karp was in this conversation right now, he would say, "Well, a healthy border really does matter and that's not political. That's just like, hey, do we want illegal immigrants taking away jobs?"

Do you have TDS? And did that impact how you write?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 好的，我不会回避你的问题，我会回答的。但首先我想说的是，他在这方面的观点已经发生了演变。你回头看看他在特朗普第一个任期内对我和其他人说的话。他对我说：“我完全赞成这个国家的人口结构发生变化，只要是通过合法移民实现的。”他对此没有任何意见。但他的观点已经变了。他认为 2024 年的选举是一次维持国家人口结构不变的投票。因此，他现在对支持 ICE 毫无顾虑。在特朗普第一个总统任期内，他确实有些顾虑，甚至说过如果他早知道会发生什么，他可能不会与 ICE 签订合同。所以他的观点已经演变了。当他说“特朗普紊乱综合症”时，我认为部分原因是我在书中提到了他当初对特朗普的言论，当时特朗普在 2015 年首次成为候选人，Karp 说了一些非常严厉的话，明确表示他不是支持者。而现在，特朗普再次当选总统。你知道，在唐纳德·特朗普的华盛顿，商业的第一条规则是不要惹恼唐纳德·特朗普。第二条规则是尽你所能去讨好他。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** All right. I'm not going to avoid your question. I'm going to get to your question, but the first thing I would say is like, look, his views have evolved on this issue. You go back and look at the stuff he said to me and others during the first Trump administration. He said to me, "I am totally in favor of the demographics of this country changing if it's changed through legal immigration." No issue with that. His views have evolved on that. He believes that the 2024 election was a vote to keep the demographics of the country the same. And hence he has no qualms now about supporting ICE. He did have some qualms during the first Trump presidency and in fact said that if he had known what was going to happen, he might not have signed the contract with ICE. So his views have evolved. When he says Trump derangement syndrome, I think part of this is because in the book I'm dredging up stuff he said about Trump when Trump first became a candidate in 2015, and Karp said some pretty harsh stuff. He made very clear he was not a supporter. And it's now, Trump is president now again. And the way it works is the first rule of business in Donald Trump's Washington is don't piss off Donald Trump. The second rule is do what you can to ingratiate yourself with him.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 但我想反驳一下。我曾和其他科技公司的 CEO 聊过，其中一些人……我私下和一位身价 1200 亿美元公司的 CEO 聊过，他告诉我民主党放弃了他所关心的一切，主要是在加密货币和人工智能方面。这是一个终身的民主党人。

但为了让他的公司从千亿级别发展到万亿级别，他需要站在对加密货币和人工智能持明智态度的人一边。过去几个月我们看到的《天才法案》（Genius Act）就是例证，我们有了一些真正有意义的加密货币法规，而不是 Gary Gensler 那种反加密的立场。你认为这不是 Palantir 为了让业务保持在正确轨道上而演变，而是 Karp 意识到民主党还没有准备好演变吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** But to push back on that real quick, one thing that I've spoken to about other tech CEOs, some of them have, I've spoke to one CEO privately who's CEO of a company worth $120 billion, and he told me the Democrats gave up on everything he cared about, which primarily was rooted in crypto and AI. And this is a guy who's a lifelong Democrat.

But for him to advance his business to one day become a trillion dollar company instead of a hundred billion dollar company, he needs to be on the side of the people that are sensible around crypto and AI. And what we've seen with the Genius Act over the past couple months, we have some really meaningful crypto regulations that are not the Gary Gensler anti-crypto. Do you think it's not Palantir evolving to keep their business in the right space, which of course that plays a part of it, but Karp realizing that the Democrats just aren't ready to evolve?

</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我认为，而且我很好奇我的书在一些进步派期刊上会得到怎样的评价，因为我完全预料到在某些地方可能会有严厉的批评，说我对 Karp 太公正了。这些人并不真正喜欢他，不喜欢 Palantir，也不喜欢亿万富翁。但我希望它能被以开放的心态阅读，因为你回头看，Karp 在 2019 年对我说过，书中有引述，他说：“看，我不认为人们反对移民，他们只是对非法移民不满，他们不喜欢边境的混乱景象。你要么认真对待他们的担忧，要么他们就会转向那些确实认真对待他们担忧的政治家。”

我会说，我是一个进步派，我不介意这么说，我的同情心在那里。现在我们又迎来了唐纳德·特朗普再次当选总统。我认为，很难说他在这点上是错的。

我们现在有两次选举了。如果你对特朗普的第一个总统任期不满意，边境问题一直存在，现在你又迎来了第二个特朗普总统任期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I think, and listen, I'll be curious to see how my book gets reviewed, if it gets reviewed in sort of progressive journals because I'm fully expecting there'll probably be harsh reception in some places that I was too fair to Karp. These are people who don't really like him, don't really like Palantir, don't like billionaires. But I think and I hope that it'll be read with an open mind because when you go back, Karp said this to me in 2019, one of our conversations is quoted in the book, he said, "Look, I don't think people are against immigration, they're not happy with illegal immigration. They don't like scenes of chaos at the border. And either you take their concerns seriously or they're going to turn to politicians who do take their concerns seriously."

And I would think that, I'm a progressive. I don't mind saying that. That's where my sympathies lie. And I would say, looking at, we're now in the second Donald Trump is president again. And I think it'd be sort of hard to argue that he was wrong about that.

We've got two elections now. And if you weren't happy with the first Trump presidency, the border was an ongoing issue and now you've got a second Trump presidency.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 而且考虑到他赢得的摇摆州，第二次选举是一次授权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** And the second one was a mandate given the swing states that he won, I think.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 他确实赢了，赢得了一场重大的胜利。我认为这与其说是对个人的授权，不如说是……但他赢了，很明显选民……现在的民调清楚地表明，人们对现在的做法并不满意，但对移民的看法似乎比想象的要微妙一些。不是人们反对移民，而是他们不喜欢边境的混乱景象。Karp 在 2019 年就说过，你必须认真对待这些事情，否则你会不喜欢结果。我认为任何公正的人都很难说他在这点上是错的。所以，他……我不认为加密货币之类的是他关心的问题。对他来说最重要的是国家安全、边境，以及他认为……我们可以稍后谈到 10 月 7 日，那对他的思想是一个非常大的影响因素。但我认为，他的政治演变肯定可以追溯到特朗普的第一个总统任期。他当时说你必须认真对待这些事情，否则选民会转向那些这样做的人。但人们没有听他的，反而在抗议 Palantir。所以他很 perturbed，他的进步派同伴们转而反对 Palantir，反对他，把他们描绘成邪恶的人物。这把他推开了。然后是在新奥尔良发生的事情，我在书中谈到了，他们与执法部门的合作引起了很大争议。很多争议可能被夸大了，因为他们在美国并没有与很多市警察局合作。这对他们来说并不是一个非常成功的努力，现在他们已经不与任何美国市警察局合作了。这是一个非常复杂的问题，正如 Karp 自己所说，存在种族化执法的历史，人们对新奥尔良的数据驱动警务有很多担忧。但在新奥尔良，凶杀案泛滥，90% 的受害者是黑人，90% 的作案者是黑人。

真相就在数据中。Palantir 免费向该市提供了软件，以帮助降低谋杀率。但整件事却引发了争议，因为 Palantir 被指控帮助促进了不公平地针对少数族裔社区的预测性警务。这真的激怒了 Karp，因为在他看来，这是一个他们明确站在正义一方的案例。

而那些可能从 Palantir 软件的使用中受益的人，不是那些在城市里的人，而是那些远离新奥尔良那些血腥社区的进步派。那些人让我们思考这个问题。所以这是另一件真正让他与民主党疏远的事情，或者说开始了他远离民主党的步伐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, he did. He won a significant victory. I think it's less of a mandate to people, but he won. And it's very clear that voters, polling now clearly indicates that people are not really happy about how this is being done now, but the views on immigration seem a little more subtle. It's not that people are against immigration, but they don't like scenes of chaos at the border. And Karp back in 2019 said, "You got to take this stuff seriously. If you don't, you're not going to like what happens." And I think it would be very hard for anyone who's fair-minded about it to say, "Well, he was wrong about that." And so, I don't think crypto or anything like that is of concern to him. What's paramount to him are national security, the border clearly, and he believes... we can get to October 7 later, that was a very big factor in his thinking. But I think his evolution politically certainly goes back to the first Trump presidency. He's saying, "You got to take this stuff seriously or the voters are going to turn to people who do." And instead of listening to him, people are protesting Palantir. And so he was quite perturbed that his fellow progressives had turned on Palantir, had turned on him, had made them out to be these evil figures. And so that pushed them away. And then there was the stuff that happened in New Orleans, which I talk about in the book. There's a lot of controversy about their work with law enforcement, and a lot of that controversy was probably overblown because they didn't really do that much work with municipal police departments in the United States. It wasn't a very successful effort for them, and now they're not working with any municipal police departments in the United States. It's a very complicated issue, as Karp himself said. There's a history of racialized policing, a lot of concern about data-driven policing. In New Orleans, though, New Orleans had an epidemic of homicides, and 90% of the victims were black, 90% of the perpetrators were black.

The truth was in the data. Palantir gave the software to the city free of charge to help try to reduce the murder rate. And the whole thing erupted in controversy because Palantir was accused of facilitating predictive policing that was unfairly targeting minority communities. And this really incensed Karp because in his view, this was a case where they were unequivocally on the side of good.

Yeah. And not the people who were potentially benefiting from the use of Palantir software in the city, but from progressives who were far removed from the neighborhoods in New Orleans that were seeing all this carnage. Those people made us think about this. And so that was another thing that really sort of alienated him from the Democrats or started his move away from them.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 所以，当他从一个彻头彻尾的进步派（他一生都是如此，他也承认了，你也承认了）转变时，那篇文章的标题是他现在已经完全 MAGA 化了。那么问题就来了，是他作为一个进步派变成了 MAGA，还是像你这样的进步派患上了严重的 TDS，以至于看不到现实？这里谁是对的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** So, as he's moved away from like full-on progressive, which he was his entire life, and he has acknowledged that, you've acknowledged that, the title of that article was "he's now gone full MAGA." So the question then comes down to, has he as a progressive gone MAGA, or have the progressives like yourself have a massive case of TDS that aren't seeing reality? Who's right here?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 嗯，听着，他在书中描述为 TDS 的东西，我认为有点夸张了。我会说这是支持真相，而不是 TDS，但观点可能因人而异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I mean, listen, what he would call, what he would describe in the book as TDS, I think there's, I think it's slightly exaggerated. I would say it's pro-truth, not TDS, but that's, you know, opinions may vary.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这是一个有 TDS 的人会说的话。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** That's what a person who has TDS would say.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我想他会说几件事。他不是一个**新保守主义者**（Neoconservative: 一种政治思潮，通常主张强硬的外交政策和军事干预）。他费尽心机强调他不是。但就像 60、70 年代的新保守主义者一样，他会说不是他离开了左派，而是左派离开了他。

在特朗普第一个总统任期内，他明确表示不喜欢特朗普，不希望特朗普当总统。他大声表达了他的不满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** I think he, listen, he would say a couple of things. He's not a neocon. He takes pains to emphasize he's not a neocon, but like the neocons of the 60s and 70s, he would say that he didn't leave the left, the left left him.

So there's that. I would say that he, during the first Trump presidency, he made very clear he did not like Trump. He did not want Trump as president. He made his disapproval loud.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 我想他甚至在某种程度上支持了哈里斯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** He even endorsed Harris to an extent, I think.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 是的，他确实如此。但如果你是一家与美国政府做生意的公司，而且他们确实与政府有很多业务往来，你某种程度上必须站队。但与其他一些科技高管相比——我就不点名了，但你知道我指的是谁——他们的机会主义就像汗水一样往下滴。他找到了支持的理由。这不仅仅是因为你必须这么做，而是现在有些事情他确实赞同。他现在在移民问题上是个强硬派。我在书中对此有广泛的讨论，他现在与彼得·蒂尔的观点更加一致。

他改变了主意，不仅因为他将特朗普 2024 年的选举胜利看作是维持国家人口结构不变的投票，他也通过 10 月 7 日在以色列发生的事情、他所看到的大学校园里反犹主义的爆发来看待这个问题。在 10 月 7 日之前，他认为移民问题对民主党来说是一个有毒的问题。10 月 7 日之后，他也认为这对美国犹太人来说是一个有毒的问题。

我认为书的这一部分会引发很多讨论和相当大的争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Yeah. Well, he did. If you're a company that does business with the US government, and they do a lot of business with the government, you sort of have to get on board here. But in contrast to some other tech executives, I won't name names, but you know who I'm referring to, the opportunism kind of drips off them like sweat. He found reasons to get behind it. It's not just because you have to, but there are things that he approves of now. He is now a hardliner on immigration. And I talk about that extensively in the book, and he's much more in line now with Peter Thiel's view.

He's changed his mind about it, not just because he sees Trump's second election victory in 2024 as a vote to keep the demographics of the country the same, but he also sees it through the prism of October 7th, what happened in Israel, the outbreak of what he saw as an outbreak of anti-semitism on college campuses. And before October 7th, he saw immigration as a toxic issue for the Democrats. After October 7th, he also sees it as a toxic issue for American Jews.

This is a part of the book that I think is going to generate a lot of conversation and a fair amount of controversy.</p>
</details>

### 10 月 7 日的冲击与脆弱感

**Amit Kukreja:** 是的，我们来谈谈以色列的话题。我认为这是书中一个相当微妙的部分。显然，Karp 是犹太人，他看到 10 月 7 日的暴行，相当于美国发生了 5 万人死亡的事件。

他一直明确表示自己是犹太人，从不回避。如果有人问他，他会谈论。

这带回了一种感觉，“我们一直说‘永不再发生’，但现在它正在发生。”

同时，书中也有一些引述说，Karp 并不介意内塔尼亚胡下台，因为他对以色列政府在巴勒斯坦所做的一切并非完全认同。所以，我想问题是，你认为 10 月 7 日发生了什么，真正让 Karp 在《纽约时报》上刊登广告说“我们与以色列站在一起”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Yeah, I think let's just transition then to the Israel conversation here. So, I thought this was a pretty nuanced part of the book. Obviously, Karp is Jewish and he saw the atrocities of October 7th, equivalent to, you know, 50,000 people in the United States.

He's always been explicitly Jewish. He never hides away from it. If someone asks him, he'll talk about it.

And this brought back the sense of, "Well, we've always said never again, and now it's happening."

At the same time, you have some quotes in the book that says Karp wouldn't mind if Netanyahu, let's just say, wasn't the president, given there might not be a full alignment between everything the Israeli government has been doing in Palestine. So, I guess the question here is we'll just start it off with what do you think happened on October 7th that really got Karp to take out an advertisement in the New York Times and say we stand with Israel?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我认为这回到了我之前提到的观点。理解 Karp 的关键是他从小就有的那种脆弱感。

即使他积累了巨额财富，拥有庞大的安保团队，他仍然有这种脆弱感。10 月 7 日，以色列的这场大屠杀，震撼了他，也震撼了许多犹太人。这是自大屠杀以来最大规模的对犹太人的屠杀。

他一直知道反犹主义是世界上的一股强大力量，犹太人是脆弱的，但这次事件以一种在他有生之年、在我有生之年都未曾有过的方式，让他深刻感受到了危险。再次强调，不要低估他的恐惧因素。这是理解 Palantir 的关键。

正如他在 2019 年对我说的，他的恐惧驱动了这家公司的很多特质。所以，这对世界来说显然是一个巨大的、地震级的事件，对 Palantir 来说也是巨大的，对他个人而言，更是一个重大的、震撼他核心的事件，并以各种方式激励了他。他从一开始就非常直言不讳地谈论发生的事情，并对其他人没有发声感到沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I think this gets back to the point I made earlier. The key to understanding Karp is this sense of vulnerability that he's had from a very young age.

And again, even with the wealth he has amassed, even with his vast security detail, he still has this sense of vulnerability. And October 7th, this pogrom in Israel, shook him, as it shook many Jews. It was the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust.

He always knew that anti-semitism was a powerful force in the world, that Jews were vulnerable, but this really, in a way that not in his lifetime, not in mine, brought home the danger. And again, do not discount the fear factor for him. This is essential to understanding Palantir.

As he told me way back in 2019, his fear drives a lot of what makes this company what it is. And so this was just a huge event for, a seismic event obviously for the world, huge for Palantir, and on a personal level, just a major, major event for him and something that shook him to the core and galvanized him in all sorts of ways. And he was very outspoken about what happened from the start and was frustrated that other people weren't speaking out.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 你认为这为什么让他如此生气？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Why do you think that pissed him off so much?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 因为他认为他们是懦夫。他相信他们中的许多人百分之百同意他的观点，但只是不想被大学生们尖叫指责，不想被那些对以色列不满的人指责。所以他们只想低调行事。而这显然不是他的行事方式。

他不会低调。在这种情况下，他当然没有，但这让他很恼火。我认为关于以色列的章节是理解他如何走到今天这一步的真正关键，因为在这里你看到他不仅仅是在理清思路——他已经很确信特朗普会赢。这是在 2023 年、2024 年，我们进行这些对话的时候。他很确信特朗普会赢。但在这里你开始看到他开始站队特朗普。

他几乎是在说，他认为特朗普的胜利对以色列更好，美国犹太人在特朗普治下会更安全。我认为你可以在这里看到这一点。我们有一次对话，是在 10 月 7 日后一两周。你必须了解 Karp 的另一件事是，他喜欢争论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Because he thought that they were being cowards. That he believed that many of them agreed with him 100%, but just didn't, as he said, they didn't want to be screamed at by college kids. They didn't want to be screamed at by people who were unhappy with Israel. And so they just wanted to keep their heads down. And that's obviously not the way he does things.

He doesn't keep his head down. And in this case, he certainly didn't, but it irritated him. And I think the chapter on Israel is the sort of real key to understanding how he got here because this is where you see him not just wrapping his mind... I mean, he's pretty convinced that Trump is going to win. So this is 2023, 2024, we're having these conversations. He's pretty convinced that Trump is going to win. But this is where you start to see him like sort of getting on board with Trump.

He is all but saying that he thinks a Trump victory would be better for Israel and that American Jews would be safer under Trump. And I think that's where you kind of see it. There's this conversation we have, it's like a week or two after October 7th. And the thing, one of the other things you have to understand about Karp is he likes to argue.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 智力上的交锋非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Intellectual sparring really matters.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 是的，但在 Palantir，从一开始就需要开放的讨论。你需要人们能够坦率地说话，强硬地反驳，即使是针对 CEO。正如 Aki Jain 对我说的，Karp 的观点是，你应该能够对 CEO 说“去你妈的”。在这种非常激烈、高压的氛围中，人们交流思想，强硬地反驳他们认为错误的事情，你就能开发出更优秀的产品，最终也证明了这一点。但他就是喜欢争论。

这是他的本性，也是他成长的方式。一个非常活跃的家庭。他的表弟 Matt Johnson 告诉我，他以前去他们家吃饭，走出去在人行道上还能听到他们在争吵，Karp 和他的父母、兄弟。所以就是这样。我们在他华盛顿的办公室里进行这次对话，是在 10 月 7 日后一两周。这很有趣，因为他非常善于说服人，说话非常有说服力，充满绝对的信念。但在这种情况下，他似乎不是在试图说服我。他只是说：“我不认为唐纳德·特朗普是法西斯主义者。我不认为他是反犹主义者。我不认为他是个偏执狂。”等等。我什么都没说，感觉他更像是在说服自己，让自己觉得，“如果我必须站队，我可以。”我现在确实认为，他认为特朗普当总统对以色列更好，对美国犹太人也更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** It is, but like at Palantir, it was like from the start, there needed to be an open discourse. You need to have people need to be able to speak candidly, frankly, push back hard, even against the CEO. As Aki Jain said to me, Karp's view was you should be able to tell even the CEO to go [fuck] himself. And that was, out of this very intense hothouse atmosphere, people batting around ideas, pushing back hard against things they thought were wrong, you would develop superior products, and that ultimately proved to be the case. But he just likes to argue.

It's who he is. It's how he grew up. A very animated household. His cousin, Matt Johnson, tells me he used to hear them arguing. He'd be over there for dinner, he walks out and he'd hear them from the sidewalk arguing. Karp and his parents and his brother. So, this is just how it is. And we're having this conversation in his Washington office. It's like a week or two after October 7th. And this was interesting because another thing about him is he's very persuasive, very convincing, speaks with utter conviction. But in this case, it wasn't like me he was trying to convince. He just says, "I don't think Donald Trump's a fascist. I don't think he's anti-semitic. I don't think he's a bigot." And all this stuff. And there was nothing I had said. It was just more sort of him just sort of, I felt like he was just sort of working his way into like saying,

"I can get on board. If I have to get on board with this, I can." And I do think I certainly now, I know that he thinks that Trump is, having Trump as president is better for Israel in his view, better for American Jews.</p>

### 乌克兰战争中的 Palantir

**Amit Kukreja:** 另一个非常重大的地缘政治事件，你在书中也讨论了，是乌克兰和俄罗斯。

Karp 是最早到达那里的 CEO 之一。我实际上不知道关于波兰的那个故事，他必须经过所有这些不同的地方……我不知道那是怎么发生的，但他到了那里。他见到了泽连斯基。然后有一段时间，他不能公开说他们的软件是乌克兰能够抵抗的原因。但有一天他说：“去他的，我们要让世界知道。”你对他对乌克兰人民的钦佩以及确保他们的软件在乌克兰前线的做法有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Another geopolitical event that was pretty massive and you discussed in the book was Ukraine, Russia.

Karp was one of the first CEOs to get there. I actually didn't know the story about Poland and he had to go through all these different... I didn't know how that happened, but he got there. He got to meet Zelenskyy. And then for a while, he wasn't allowed to publicly say that their software was the reason why Ukraine was putting up a fight. But then one day he said, "Screw it. We're going to let the world know." What was your take on his admiration for the Ukrainian people and for making sure their software was at the forefront of Ukraine?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 从一开始，Palantir 就说他们是为了捍卫西方，不仅仅是美国，而是捍卫整个西方。有趣的是，他们从一开始就说有两个国家他们不卖软件给：中国和俄罗斯。你想想，公司成立于 2003 年，却告诉潜在投资者他们不打算在中国销售，那可是最大的新兴市场。这肯定让 Palantir 的推销变得更难了。所以这些都是大胆甚至疯狂的决定。俄罗斯还好，但中国绝对是。当然，现在这被证明是正确的。

但这花了很长时间。他和他的同事都将俄罗斯和中国视为根本上的对手。当俄罗斯在 2022 年入侵乌克兰时，这无疑证实了这一点。他相信，就像当时许多人说的那样，这是一场为自由世界对抗暴政的斗争。

我相信，参与其中的部分吸引力在于，特朗普时期很艰难，对 Palantir 和他个人来说都很艰难。反恐战争，他们的软件在阿富汗和伊拉克被使用，但整个事情变得一团糟，充满了争议。然后是特朗普第一个总统任期内所有的国内争议。现在，特朗普走了，终于有了一个 Palantir 明确站在正义一方的案例——乌克兰。这对他来说是一个巨大的解脱。

他想引起人们对这件事的关注，并为此感到非常自豪。但当然，他们必须谨慎行事。这是另一个让他沮丧的来源，因为他们的很多工作都在暗中进行，比如秘密机构、反恐等等。你知道，自从 9/11 以来，我们很少能知道哪些恐怖袭击被挫败了。

这些信息不与公众分享，这也是应该的。但他对我说，这 20 年来他一直很沮丧，因为 Palantir 做的很多重要工作都无法被承认，因为它发生在暗处，也应该留在暗处。所以，乌克兰事件发生了。入侵后不久，我正和他在一起。他现在开始给股东和投资者写信，配合每次的财报发布。他们在华盛顿写一封信，信的结尾是“Palantir 的技术在乌克兰的战斗中”。

那句话必须被编辑掉，改成“为西方的战斗”。

这再次加剧了他的挫败感。所以几个月后，他去了达沃斯。因为如果你还记得，2022 年 1 月的达沃斯因为新冠疫情被取消了，所以他们在 5 月举行。我当时和他在一起，那里有很多乌克兰官员。他与他们会面，Palantir 显然在支持乌克兰。一些官员问：“你想来见见泽连斯基吗？”然后 Karp 对我说：“我在考虑去基辅。”我想，好吧，太好了。我以为是等事情平息下来，结果下周他就在那儿了。

他想表达他的支持。他非常非常喜欢泽连斯基，感觉与他有种亲切感。这也是向世界宣告“Palantir 参与其中”的一种方式，并为那些多年来在反恐和暗中工作却从未得到应有承认的努力争取一些功劳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I think, listen, from the start, Palantir said it was about defending the West, not just the United States, about defending the West. And it's interesting because from the start, they said there are two countries we're not selling this to. We're not selling it to China and we're not selling it to Russia. And think about that, because you're talking about a company that starts in 2003 and you're telling potential investors, "Oh, we're not going to sell in China," the largest emerging market. And Palantir was a tough sell to begin with. That didn't make it any easier, I'm sure. And so those were like sort of bold, slash crazy calls. Russia less so, but certainly China. Now, of course, it's been vindicated.

But that took a long time. And he and his colleagues saw both Russia and China as fundamentally adversarial. And certainly when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, that was confirmation, as if anyone needed it, that it was fundamentally adversarial. And he believed, as many people said at the time, that this was a fight for the free world versus tyranny.

And part of the appeal for getting involved with this, I believe, and it's quite clear, the Trump years were hard. They were hard for Palantir. They were hard for him. The war on terrorism, the software had been used in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the whole thing had sort of become a shitshow. The war on terrorism was mired in controversy, Guantanamo, all this sort of stuff. So, you've got that, and then you've got obviously all the domestic controversy during the first Trump presidency, ISIS and so forth. Here was a case finally, okay, Trump is gone, and here's a case where Palantir is unequivocally on the side of good, Ukraine. And so, that was a huge relief for him.

Something he wanted to call attention to. Took great pride in it. But of course, yeah, they've got to be circumspect. This is another source of frustration because so much of their work is in the shadows. I mean, clandestine services and so forth, counterterrorism. And it's, this has been said forever, ever since 9/11, we rarely find out about the terrorist attacks that were thwarted.

It's just not shared with the public, and rightly so. But he said to me, it's been a 20-year frustration that a lot of the essential work that Palantir was doing couldn't be recognized because it was taking place in the shadows and that's where it was supposed to remain. So, Ukraine happens. I'm with him right after the invasion. And he is now doing these letters to shareholders, to investors, timed to coincide with each earnings report. And they're writing a letter, and the letter finishes, "Palantir software, Palantir technologies in the fight in Ukraine."

And that had to be edited out. "In the fight," yeah.

"Fight for the West."

"Fight for the West," exactly. And again, just sort of reinforcing this frustration he felt. And so what happens a couple of months later? He goes to Davos. Because if you remember, Davos was canceled in January of 2022 because of COVID. So, they held it in May. I'm with him there, and there are Ukrainian officials all over. A number of Ukrainian officials there, and he meets with them, and they're obviously supporting, Palantir is supporting Ukraine. And some officials said, "Would you like to come and meet Zelenskyy?" And Karp says to me, "I'm thinking about going to Kyiv." And I'm like, "Okay, that's great." And I'm thinking, you know, when things quiet down. Next week, he's there.

And he wanted to show his support. He found, he really, really liked Zelenskyy. The meeting was just, he really felt a kinship with him. So, it was a way of saying to the world, "Palantir's involved," and of getting the credit that it couldn't claim for all those years it was working on counterterrorism and in the shadows and stuff, never getting the credit he felt it deserved.</p>

### 哲学家的商业之道

**Amit Kukreja:** 在 Palantir 的核心，Karp 经常非常哲学地谈论**本体论**（Ontology: 在哲学上指对“存在”本身的研究，在计算机科学中指对概念和关系的明确形式化规范），因为它是一个哲学术语。事实上，我之所以对 Palantir 感兴趣，部分原因是我在高中时学过哲学，本体论、大陆哲学、伊曼努尔·康德，我认识这个词很多年了，然后我看到 Palantir 把他们的数据描述为一个系统的本体结构。

你认为 Karp 是如何更广泛地将哲学思想与商业联系起来，以至于每个季度都会发布一封充满德国哲学家引言的股东信？有些人对此感到反感，觉得“老兄，给我数字就行了”。

但像我这样的很多散户投资者却觉得，“天哪，他说话的方式几乎是深刻的，你可以在一百年后在哈佛商学院研究这些信件。”

你如何看待商业本身中的哲学？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** At its core, you know, Karp talks very philosophically about an ontology because it is a philosophical term. In fact, one of the reasons I got into Palantir is because I studied philosophy in high school and ontology, continental philosophy, Immanuel Kant, like I recognized that term for so many years and then I'm looking at Palantir. Like they describe their data as an ontological structure of a system.

How do you think Karp has more broadly taken philosophical ideas and connected them to the business to the point where a shareholder letter comes out every quarter written with all these quotes from German philosophers. Some people are turned off by it like, "Dude, just give me the numbers."

Someone like me and a lot of other retail investors are like, "Oh my goodness, he's speaking in a way that's almost profound, almost like you would study these letters in a hundred years in Harvard school."

How do you think about the philosophy in the business in and of itself?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我认为这是其中一个重要部分。他没有计算机科学背景，但本体论是其中的一个重叠部分。工程师们思考组织数据和构建世界观的方式，对他来说并不是一个巨大的跨越。

你和那些早期的软件工程师交谈，比如 Aki Jain，他会说，Karp 写作和思考的方式，即使他们说着不同的语言，但其中有一种技术结构，能与他们产生共鸣。他们能看到与他们思考问题、解决问题的方式非常相似的东西。所以，在内部，存在某种重叠，使他能够与这些人建立联系，反之亦然。

这可能并不明显。你看着他会想，这家伙怎么能经营这家公司？他怎么和这些软件工程师交谈？但他们并非来自完全不同的世界。显然，他来自人文学科背景，这对 Palantir 非常有帮助，因为他能比一群年轻的软件工程师更宏观地思考工作的意义。需要指出的是，我们现在都在谈论隐私和公民自由，这些在 Palantir 出现时是非常重要的讨论，因为那是在 9/11 和《爱国者法案》之后。但那是在 iPhone 推出前几年，在个人数据爆炸之前。所以这些人在某些方面真的走在了时代的前面。Karp 从一开始就对风险和重要性非常警惕，即创造强大的软件，但同时需要保护隐私和公民自由。

只有哲学家在 35 岁时才会如此关注这些更广泛的影响。Karp 有个想法，就是用技术来解决技术带来的问题。你可以在软件中嵌入这些控制措施。正如他所说，这是一种**黑格尔式**（Hegelian: 源自德国哲学家黑格尔，指通过正题、反题、合题的辩证过程来解决矛盾）的解决方案。这两个看似对立的东西，你可以达到一种综合，生产出既能让分析师获取所需信息，又能同时保护数百万无辜者数据的软件。这就是他的想法。我认为，他将此视为一种黑格尔式的解决方案，这或许有些简单化，但这正是他思考的方式，也是你可能看到他的哲学背景从早期就发挥作用的地方。他是一位有资历的学者，曾与在世最著名的哲学家尤尔根·哈贝马斯（Jürgen Habermas）共事过。

在欧洲，这可是件大事。我记得和空中客车公司前 CEO 汤姆·恩德斯（Tom Enders）交谈时，他说：“是的，我知道他曾师从这位非常重要的哲学家。这在欧洲是一张巨大的名片。”

这似乎让他更容易在欧洲做生意，不仅对其他 CEO，对欧洲媒体来说，他也成了一个非常引人入胜的人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I think it's an important part of it. I mean, listen, no background in computer science, and yet, there was this overlap with ontology being part of it. The way that the engineers thought about organizing data and constructing a worldview, it wasn't that big of a leap for him.

As it might have seemed. And you talk to some of the software engineers who were there from the early days, Aki Jain for instance would say that the way he wrote, the way he thought, even if they were sort of talking different languages, there was a sort of technical structure to the way Karp thought and talked and wrote that resonated with them. They could see something very similar to how they thought about things, how they addressed problems, how they tackled things. So internally, there was a certain overlap there that made it possible for him to connect with these people and they with him.

That might not have been apparent. You just kind of look at this and say, "How is this guy going to run this company? How's he going to talk to these software engineers?" And so they were not from completely different worlds. And obviously, he comes from this background in the humanities. I think it was very helpful for Palantir in the sense that he could think through the implications of the work on a broader scale than a bunch of young software engineers. It's important to point out that we now talk all about privacy, civil liberties. Those were very important discussions when Palantir came along because of course it was after 9/11, after the Patriot Act. These are real concerns. But this was a couple of years before the iPhone is introduced, before this explosion in personal data. So these guys are really ahead of the curve in some ways. And Karp was very alert from the start to the risks and to the importance of creating this powerful software, but we need to do it in a way that can protect privacy and civil liberties.

And only a philosopher would have that much of a focus at 35 years old. To think about these broader implications, to understand that, and to be able to talk... Karp has this idea that there's a technological solution to the problem posed by the technology. You could actually embed in the software these controls. And as he put it, it's like this sort of Hegelian solution. So these two seeming opposites, and you kind of come to a synthesis where you could actually produce software that would allow the analyst to get the information they need but at the same time protect the data of millions of innocent people who should not be pulled into the dragnet. And that was his idea. And I think the idea that he thought about this as sort of this Hegelian solution, maybe it's a little simplistic, but I think that's kind of how he thought and where you might see the philosophic background coming into play from early on. He is a credentialed scholar. He worked for a time with the most celebrated living philosopher, Jürgen Habermas.

And certainly in Europe, this was a big deal. I remember talking to Tom Enders, the former CEO of Airbus, and he was just like, he was talking, he and Karp had gotten to know each other at Davos, and then Palantir comes in to help them with a production glitch with the A350, and that's the beginning of the relationship. And Enders is just like, he's talking about, he said it was one of the best decisions he made at Airbus to bring in Palantir, but we're just talking about Karp. He said, "Yeah, I knew he studied with this very important philosopher. It's a huge calling card in Europe."

It it seemed to, it made him a source of great intrigue not just to other CEOs but also European press.</p>

### 胜利的喜悦与未来展望

**Amit Kukreja:** 你认为他喜欢这种成功吗？他喜欢的不是经济回报，而是像我这样早期买入并因此成名、财务上改变了生活的人。你认为他喜欢故事的这一部分吗？你认为他希望这种情况继续下去吗？你认为他也喜欢那些搞错了的分析师、专业人士错得如此离谱，以至于他看起来如此正确，这几乎是他一生的胜利，证明了他们是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Do you think that he loves the success? He loves the not the financial rewards, but rather the people like me that ended up buying in early and made a name for myself and like financially changed my life. Do you think he loves that part of the story? Do you think he wants that to keep going? And do you think he also loves that the analysts, the professionals that got it wrong are so wrong that he looks so right and it almost is this like victory of a lifetime that he proved them wrong.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 是的。我认为他当然感到非常得意，他现在正高兴地庆祝胜利，而且短期内不会停止。他对机构投资者一直持负面看法，这可以追溯到他在沙山路（Sand Hill Road）为 Palantir 融资时受到的冷遇。基本上所有人都拒绝了他，所以这让他对机构投资者产生了一些敌意，这种敌意后来延伸到了华尔街分析师身上。听着，当时股票表现不佳，公司成立 18 年了还没盈利，所以怀疑并非完全没有根据。但他觉得，与你这样的人相比，华尔街分析师不了解 Palantir，也永远不会了解，他已经懒得向他们解释了。所以现在他正处于一种胜利巡游的状态，他感到得意，而且我猜他还会继续嘲讽他们一段时间。但我也想说，他相信 Palantir 最好的日子还在后头。

他现在快 60 岁了，还保持着疯狂的日程安排。是的，对他来说更容易些，因为他没有妻子和孩子，所以他可以这样生活，但这仍然是一个相当辛苦的日程。他很少在同一个地方睡超过一两个晚上，总是在路上。

但我认为这是因为他热爱他所做的事情。这家公司是他毕生的事业。我也认为因为他相信，最好的还在后面，他想亲眼见证。尽管他喜欢在越野滑雪道上，但我认为他觉得，花了 20 年才走到这一步，最好的还在后面，他想亲眼见证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Yeah. Well, I think he certainly feels very vindicated and he is happily spiking the football these days and he's not going to stop. He's had a, he is down on institutional investors for many, many years. This goes back to the rough reception he received on Sand Hill Road when going out to try to raise money for Palantir and basically they all said no. So that kind of gave him some hostility towards institutional investors that then carried over to Wall Street analysts certainly after the company goes public. And listen, the stock was not doing well.

The company hadn't turned a profit. You're 18 years in and it still hasn't turned a profit. And so, it's not like the skepticism was totally unfounded, but he felt that in contrast to people like you, Wall Street analysts didn't understand Palantir and were never going to understand it, and he was done trying to explain it to them. So there is this victory lap that he's sort of on now and he feels vindicated and he's not going to stop dunking on them for a while yet is my guess. But I would also say that I think he believes that Palantir's best days are still to come.

He's in his late 50s now. He's keeping up this crazy schedule. And yeah, it's easier for him in a sense because he doesn't have a wife and kids and so he can live like this, but it's still a pretty backbreaking schedule. He's rarely in the same bed more than one or two nights at any time, on the road constantly.

But I think it's because he loves what he does. This company is his life's work. And I also think because he believes the best is still to come for Palantir and he wants to be there for it. As much as he likes to be out on the cross country skiing trails, I think he thinks, it's 20 years to get to this point, he feels like the best is still to happen and he wants to be there for it.</p>

**Amit Kukreja:** 是的，在后记里。你写得完全正确。你去年十二月那个下午到的时候，Karp 和我正在交谈。

首先，能看到我的名字被这样一本书永垂不朽，对我来说真的很酷。所以我确实要感谢你。这对我意义重大。我想我之所以能出现在那里让你写下那个情景，唯一的原因是公司接纳了散户投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** It is there in the epilogue. And what you wrote is exactly correct. When you arrived that afternoon in December, Karp and I were in conversation.

And so first of all, it was just really cool for me to see my name get immortalized in a book like this. And so I do thank you for that. That means a lot. And I guess the only reason I was there for you to even write about that situation is because the company has embraced the retail investor.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 你显然是 Palantir 散户投资者中最知名的，是那些支持 Palantir、成为 Karp 粉丝的人的象征。这是故事中非常重要的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** You're obviously the best known among retail investors of Palantir, those who have gotten on board with Palantir, those who have become Karp fanboys, if you will. You are the best known and sort of symbolize... I mean, because this is a really important part of the story.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 这也是我的最后一个问题，你认为为什么散户投资者会拥抱 Palantir？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** Which was going to be my question by the way, why do you think the retail investor embraces Palantir? That's my last question.</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 因为我认为他们觉得他是一个真实的人物，一个……他们觉得他很有趣，他在电视上很搞笑，他想什么就说什么。所以有真实性因素。他会说，他们理解 Palantir 的故事，而分析师不理解。他们以一种非常简单的方式理解：这家公司是站在美国和西方一边的，他们希望看到它成功，并愿意把钱投在他们的情感所向之处。

他们相信公司会成功，相信他对公司正在做什么、在哪里看到机会的解释。

在机构投资者持怀疑态度、华尔街分析师非常怀疑的时候，有这样一个散户投资者社区，他们称他为“Karp 爸爸”、“Karp 老爹”之类的，他喜欢这样。他觉得这很可爱。

更重要的是，不仅仅是满足自尊心，而是有这样一个投资者社区，他们相信这个故事。

他们说：“好吧，现在股价是七八块，但我认为它会涨。”他们认为这里面有东西。使用该软件的公司和组织都对它赞不绝口。你们知道，当空客有 4 万人每天使用这个软件时，这个产品就是货真价实的。

即使华尔街分析师低估了这一点，或者没有给予应有的重视，但有一个投资社区明白，这是一个相当重要的成就，这不仅说明了软件的质量，也说明了这项技术的潜力。如果它对一个大公司如此重要，如果它对美国军方如此重要，那么这里面就有很大的上升空间。

值得在 7、8、15、25 美元，甚至 100 美元时投入一些钱。

所以，我认为这是很大一部分原因。显然，你作为一个非常公开地支持的人出现了。你在财报电话会议上也能看到，他想听的是散户投资者的意见。

他会把话筒给几个华尔街分析师，但主要是散户投资者。他现在说，当公司进入标普 500 指数时，他发布了那个视频，说这属于两个群体：Palantir 的员工和我们的散户投资者。

是的，现在专业投资界已经大量持有该股，他们也接受了这个故事，但他显然没有忘记在故事更难被接受时，是谁相信了这个故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, because I think they find him to be an authentic figure, a figure of... they find him entertaining. He's very funny. You see him on TV, he just says what he thinks. So there's the authenticity factor. And he would say that they understood the Palantir story in a way that analysts didn't. They understood in a very simple way: This is the company on the side of the United States and the West, and they wanted to see it succeed and were willing to put their money where their sentiments lay.

And believed that the company would succeed and bought his explanation for what the company was doing, where it saw opportunities.

And at a time when institutional investors were skeptical, Wall Street analysts were very skeptical, there was this community of retail investors who said, "Papa Karp," "Daddy Karp," all that sort of stuff. And he liked that. He found that very endearing.

And more importantly than just the ego gratification, it was the fact that there was this community of investors who bought the story.

And who said, "Okay, yeah, the stock's at seven or eight now, but I think it's going up." I think there is something to this. Companies that, organizations that use the software swear by it. I mean, you guys knew in a way that, when you've got 40,000 people at Airbus using the software on a daily basis, the product is legit.

And even if Wall Street analysts were discounting that or just not giving it the weight it deserved, there was an investment community that understood that that's a pretty significant achievement and that spoke not just to the quality of the software, but to the potential for this technology. That if it was that integral, if it had become that integral to a major corporation and if it was that integral to the US military, that there was a lot of upside here.

And that it was worth putting some of your money in at $7, $8, $15, $25...

$100.

Exactly. So I think that was a big part of it. And obviously, you emerged as someone who got on board in a very public way. And you see it with the earnings call. It's the retail investors he wants to hear from.

He'll throw the mic to a few Wall Street analysts, a few investment bank analysts, but it's the retail investors. And he says now, when the company got into the S&P 500, he releases that video and he said, "This belongs to two groups: Palantirians and our retail investors."

Right? That's, obviously the professional investment community is now very heavily in the stock and they've bought the story, but he has clearly not forgotten who bought the story when it was a harder story to buy.</p>
</details>

**Amit Kukreja:** 好的，Michael，最后一个问题。你希望人们在阅读这本书的整个生命周期里，从中带走什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Amit Kukreja:** All right, Michael, last question for you. What do you want people to take away from the book over the lifetime of people reading it?</p>
</details>

**Michael Steinberger:** 我认为有几点。首先，这是一个非常有趣的商业故事。你不仅能从公司巨大的估值中看到其重要性，还能从它催生的事物中看到。从 Palantir 走出了多少公司，尤其是在国防科技领域的兴趣爆炸式增长，Palantir 为此铺平了道路。现在每个人都在谈论国防科技，向爱国资本的转向，这完全是 Palantir 的产物。

Palantir 的影响不容小觑。你看到其他科技公司，如 OpenAI 等，现在也在拥抱“前沿部署工程师”（forward deployed model）模式。这不是从 Palantir 开始的，但他们重新定义了这个角色。现在你看到其他公司说，这确实有道理，派工程师出去和客户一起工作，不是问“你的业务能否适应我们的软件”，而是“我们的软件能否适应你的业务”。

这似乎很基本，但 Palantir 为此铺平了道路。所以，这是一个相当惊人的商业故事。当然，最惊人的方面是，这个没有商业背景、没有计算机科学背景的人，成功地将这家公司带到了 4000 亿美元的估值。这是一个非凡的商业故事。其次，在商业政治方面，如果你想理解我们所处的这个时代，这本书值得一读。

Palantir 现在处于一切的中心。想想过去 10 个月里占据头条的事情：Doge、ICE、以色列、AI。

它处于一切的中心。我认为，如果你想理解这个时代，你需要了解一些关于 Palantir 的事情。而要理解 Palantir，你就不能不理解它掌舵的这个非常独特和复杂的人物——Alex Karp。所以，我认为时机对这本书来说真的很好。最后，我想说，他政治上的演变，无论他是完全 MAGA 化了，还是四分之三 MAGA 化了，都是一个非常有趣的演变。这个时代的故事之一就是硅谷如何转向特朗普，以及这次对特朗普的拥抱。

Karp 是这个故事的一部分，一个主要部分，但我认为他走向那里的旅程比其他一些人物更有趣、更有启发性。我认为，如果你想理解我们正在经历的这个时代，这本书，如果我可以谦虚地说，是一个很好的方式。

<p class="english-text">**Michael Steinberger:** Well, I think there are a couple different things. I think it's a really interesting business story. And you can see the importance of this as a business story not just in the fact that the company has this massive valuation now, but in what it has spawned. The number of companies that have come out of Palantir, and you can also see it in the explosion in interest in defense tech. Palantir paved the way for that. So now everyone talks about defense tech, the pivot to patriotic capital, which is quite literally the spawn of Palantir.

Palantir's impact cannot be overstated at this point. You see other companies now, other tech companies embracing the forward deployed model. OpenAI and others, it didn't begin with Palantir, but they sort of reinvented this role. And now you see other companies saying, "This actually makes sense, sending engineers out to work with clients and finding out not what, can your business be bent to our software, but can our software be bent to your business?"

It seems kind of fundamental, but Palantir paved the way for that. So, it's a quite amazing business story. And of course, the most amazing aspect of the business story is the fact that this guy with no background in business, no background in computer science has successfully led this company to a $400 billion valuation. And that's a remarkable business story. I think you can also say that on the business political front, if you want to understand the moment we're living in, this is a book worth reading.

Palantir is at the center of everything right now. You think about the things that have dominated the headlines over the last 10 months. Doge, ICE, Israel, AI.

It's in all of this. It's at the center of everything. I think if you want to understand this moment, you need to know something about Palantir. And you cannot understand Palantir without understanding this very idiosyncratic and complex figure at its helm, Alex Karp. So I think, you know, it's better to be lucky than good. And I think the timing is really good for this book. And then I would just say that his evolution politically, whether he's gone full MAGA or three-quarters MAGA or what have you, this has been a very interesting evolution. And one of the stories of this moment is how Silicon Valley turned to Trump and its embrace of Trump this time.

Karp's part of that story, a major part of that story, but I think his journey there is a lot more interesting and a lot more revealing than perhaps some of these other figures. And I think, if you want to understand the moment we're living through, I think this book, if I can say in all modesty, is a good way of doing that.</p>
