### 美联储主席受调查

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报头条新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，1月12日，星期一。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, January 12th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 绝没有人，当然也包括**美联储主席**，可以凌驾于法律之上。但这一前所未有的举动，应放在政府威胁和持续施压的更广泛背景下看待。周日，美联储主席**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**发布了一段罕见的视频声明，称他已得知自己正成为**司法部**刑事调查的目标。他说，美联储已收到大陪审团的传票。此次调查的核心是一项**特朗普政府**数月来提出的指控，即鲍威尔就美联储总部**7亿美元**超预算的翻修范围向国会撒谎。鲍威尔曾被特朗普总统威胁解雇，他说司法部正试图恐吓他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. On Sunday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell released a rare video message saying he had learned that he is now the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. He said the Fed had been served with grand jury subpoenas. The inquiry centers on a claim the Trump administration has made for months that Powell lied to Congress about the scope of renovations of the Fed's headquarters that have run $700 million over budget. Powell, who President Trump has previously threatened to fire, said the Justice Department is trying to intimidate him.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 刑事指控的威胁，是美联储基于我们对何能最好地服务公众的最佳评估来设定利率，而不是遵循总统偏好的后果。尽管特朗普在2017年提名鲍威尔进入美联储，但总统对他的态度日益敌对，一次又一次地抨击鲍威尔不降息，尽管美联储的设计初衷是使其免受政治压力。这是特朗普对美联储独立性发动的更广泛攻击的一部分。他还试图解雇**丽莎·库克**，一位在拜登政府期间被任命的美联储理事，**最高法院**将在下周就此案进行辩论。昨晚，特朗普否认对鲍威尔的调查是出于政治动机，他说：“让他感到压力的唯一事实是利率太高了。他只有这一个压力。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president. While Trump was the one to nominate Powell to the Fed back in 2017, the president has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards him, attacking Powell again and again for not slashing interest rates, even though the Fed is designed to be insulated from political pressure. It's part of a broader assault by Trump on the Fed's independence. He's also tried to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed during the Biden administration in a case that the Supreme Court will hear arguments about next week. Last night, Trump denied that the investigation into Powell is politically motivated, saying, quote, "What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's got."

### 明州移民执法争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 这个周末，**特朗普政府**的驱逐行动以及**Renee Good**被一名**ICE**（美国移民及海关执法局）特工在明尼阿波利斯杀害的事件引发了全国范围内的强烈不满和抗议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This weekend, mounting outrage over the Trump administration's deportation campaign and the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis sparked protests across the country.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 从纽约到洛杉矶，再到休斯顿、奥马哈、波士顿、西雅图。在明尼阿波利斯市，抗议者穿过市中心，他们在酒店前停下，敲鼓奏乐，试图让任何入住那里的ICE特工无法入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: from New York to Los Angeles >> to Houston, Omaha, Boston, Seattle. In Minneapolis itself, protests wound through downtown where demonstrators stopped at hotels to bang drums and blare music to try and keep any ICE agents staying there from sleeping.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，国土安全部部长**克里斯蒂·诺埃尔**表示，政府正向明尼阿波利斯增派数百名联邦特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, >> well, Maria, we're sending more officers today and tomorrow. They'll arrive. There'll be hundreds more. Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome said the administration is sending another surge of federal agents to Minneapolis.

</details>

**Christy Gnome**: 这里是盗窃纳税人钱财和保护罪犯的“零号区域”。数十亿数十亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christy Gnome**: It is ground zero for stealing of taxpayer dollars and protecting criminals. Billions and billions of dollars.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在接受福克斯新闻采访时，诺埃尔声称，与明尼苏达州**索马里社区**有关的一起重大福利欺诈丑闻是此次部署的原因。然而，该州州长和明尼阿波利斯市市长都呼吁不要再派遣ICE官员，称这些特工的存在危及居民安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In an interview on Fox News, Gnome claimed that a major welfare fraud scandal linked to Minnesota's Somali community was the reason for the deployment. The state's governor and the Minneapolis mayor, however, have called for no more ICE officers there, saying the agents presence is putting residents in danger.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 今天在《每日新闻》节目中，明尼阿波利斯警察局长谈到了自政府开始加强其在当地的激进移民执法以来，他在这座城市所见的情况：“我们已经接到了社区居民打来的911电话急剧增加的报告，这与正在发生的许多街头执法有关。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Today on the Daily, >> we've just gotten a pretty dramatic increase in 911 calls from people in the community related to a lot of the street enforcement that's happening. the Minneapolis police chief on what he has seen in the city since the administration started ramping up its aggressive immigration enforcement there.

</details>

**Minneapolis police chief**: 我想说的是，情况各式各样，比如人们被逮捕，他们的车被遗弃在路边，有时会堵塞街道，甚至有一次车甚至没有挂在P档（停车挡）就离开了，还在往下溜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Minneapolis police chief**: And I mean, it's everything from people are being arrested and their cars are left in the roadway, sometimes blocking the street and at one case left when it wasn't even placed in park and was rolling down the road.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 等等，等等。所以，ICE官员在把某人从车里带走、逮捕他们时，甚至没有把车挂在P档？我们遇到过这种情况。还有一次车里有一只狗，他们把狗留在了车里。我是说，即使是今天早上，我们也接到了关于有人被ICE用胡椒喷雾袭击的电话。我们不得不处理和分类各种各样的服务请求，而这些请求以前是没有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Wait, wait. So, so ICE officials are are are taking someone out of their car, arresting them, and their car is not even put in park. We had that happen. We had another time where there was a dog in the car and they left the dog in the car. I mean, even this morning, we've gotten calls for individuals who were pepper-sprayed by ice. There's just a variety of calls for service that we then have to manage and triage that were not happening before.

### 伊朗局势与美方表态

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在“空军一号”上。先生，关于伊朗，他们是否越过了您的红线，触发了回应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: on Air Force One yesterday. Sir, on Iran, are they crossing your red line yet to a trigger response?

</details>

**President Trump**: 看起来他们开始这样做了，而且似乎有一些本不该被杀的人被杀了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: They're starting to, it looks like, and there seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed. These are

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **特朗普总统**表示，伊朗政府镇压抗议活动，美国正在考虑军事选项。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump said military options are on the table for Iran as the government there cracks down on protests.

</details>

**President Trump**: 但我们正在非常认真地看待此事。军方正在研究它，我们正在研究一些非常强有力的选项。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: But we're looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it and uh we're looking at some very strong options. will make it.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普此前曾表示，如果政府军杀害和平示威者，美国将介入。自上个月底以来，伊朗各地一直在举行集会。最初是作为对该国严重经济危机的反应，后来演变成了一场更大的反政府运动。特朗普曾表示，伊朗人民正在追求自由，并说：“美国随时准备提供帮助。” 随着政府试图镇压抗议活动，互联网已被切断。但本周末，零星的报道开始传出，包括医院外排着长队等待尸袋的视频。人权组织报告称，伤亡人数达数百人，当局丝毫没有缓和迹象。作为对特朗普威胁的回应，**伊朗议长**警告将进行报复性袭击，称：“如果美国打击伊朗，美国军方和航运通道将成为我们的合法目标。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Trump previously said the US would step in if government forces killed peaceful demonstrators. Crowds have been gathering across Iran since late last month. It started as a reaction to the country's deep economic crisis and it's become a larger anti-government movement. Trump has said the Iranians are looking at freedom and quote, "The USA stands ready to help." As the government has tried to subdue the protests, the internet's been cut. But reports have trickled out this weekend, including verified videos of body bags lined up outside hospitals. Human rights groups are reporting casualties in the hundreds with no sign the authorities are relenting. In response to Trump's threat, Iran's speaker of parliament warned about retaliatory attacks, saying, "If the US does strike Iran, quote, US military and shipping lanes will be our legitimate targets."

### Grock AI伦理争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 由**埃隆·马斯克**的公司**XAI**创建的聊天机器人**Grock**，已经引发了巨大的强烈反对，以至于一些国家现在已完全阻止访问它。这场争议的核心在于Grock生成真实人物性化图像的能力。例如，本月早些时候，一名年轻女子在马斯克的社交媒体平台X上发布了一张自己穿着蓝色背心的照片。在接下来的几天里，有几十个人回复了她的帖子，要求Grock为她创建穿着内衣或比基尼的新图像。Grock照做了，并将这些图像作为回复附上，这些AI图像获得了数千次浏览。这一事件是Grock生成的、将女性和儿童性化并发布在X上的图像泛滥的一部分。该系统有防止生成完全裸露图像的保护措施，但一些X用户已经找到了绕过这些限制的方法。本周末，**印度尼西亚**和**马来西亚**表示将阻止访问Grock。一位**巴西**官员呼吁在该国禁止该聊天机器人，**法国**议员表示已将X报告给检察官。作为对争议的回应，马斯克表示，任何创建儿童性化图像的用户都将“承担后果”，该公司现在将AI图像请求限制为仅限部分付费订阅用户。**英国首相**的一位发言人表示，这并非解决方案，称这是对受害者的侮辱，并且“仅仅是将允许创建非法图像的AI功能变成了一项高级服务”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The chatbot Grock, which was created by Elon Musk's company XAI, has ignited a huge backlash to the point that some countries are now blocking access to it entirely. The outrage centers on Grock's ability to turn out sexualized images of real people. For example, earlier this month, a young woman posted a picture of herself wearing a blue tank top on X Musk's social media platform. Over the next several days, dozens of people replied to her post, asking Grock to create new images of her in lingerie or bikinis. Grock did it, attaching them as replies, and those AI images racked up thousands of views. The incident is part of a flood of Grock generated images that sexualize women and children and have been posted on X. The system has safeguards to prevent it from generating fully nude images, but some X users have found ways to circumvent that. This weekend, Indonesia and Malaysia said they would be blocking access to Grock. A Brazilian official has called for the chatbot to be banned there, and French lawmakers said they've reported X to a public prosecutor. In response to the controversy, Musk said that any users who create sexualized images of children would suffer quote consequences and the company is now limiting requests for AI images only to some paid subscribers. A spokesman for the prime minister of Britain said that was not a solution, saying it was insulting to victims and quote simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.

### 乌克兰学校被同化

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，每个月在**乌克兰**，都有少量被困在前线另一侧、逃离俄罗斯占领区的人们通过边境检查站来到这里。他们提供了迄今为止关于俄罗斯统治下生活的最详细的描述。我的同事，《泰晤士报》记者**玛丽亚·韦列诺娃**采访了他们中的一些人。她说，特别是孩子们描述了在被占领学校里，试图同化儿童并将他们变成俄罗斯民族主义者的广泛企图。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, every month in Ukraine, a small stream of people who've been caught on the other side of the front lines escape from Russian occupied territory as they've come across a border checkpoint. They've given some of the most detailed accounts yet of life under Russian rule. My colleague, Times reporter Maria Verenova, has been interviewing some of them. She says that the children in particular have described a widespread attempt in occupied schools to indoctrinate kids and turn them into Russian nationalists.

</details>

**Maria Verenova**: 大多数儿童和家长告诉我很多故事，关于俄罗斯如何向他们灌输宣传。例如，乌克兰语他们已经不能学习了。他们学习了很多俄罗斯历史，在那段俄罗斯历史中，已经有关于俄罗斯占领他们家园的部分，这被称为“解放”。他们从小就在校院里进行操练，做很多旨在军事训练的练习，为战争做准备。同样，从一年级开始，学校里他们画的不是花，而是武器。一位母亲给我看了一张她孩子们的照片，他们排成一队站在教室里，手里拿着每个孩子都画的画，随便看一张画，你都能看到像机关枪、坦克之类的东西，每个孩子都拿着这幅绿色的画在他们面前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Verenova**: Most children and parents told me many stories about how Russia is pushing their propaganda on them. For example, the Ukrainian language they were not able to learn it anymore. that they were studying a lot of Russian history and in that Russian history there is already a bit about when Russia occupied their homes which is called liberating. They also from young age have been marching on a schoolyard doing lots of exercises aimed at the military training preparing them to the war. Also from very first grade at school they are drawing instead of some flowers they would be drawing weapons. One mother showed me a picture of her children standing in a line in a school class holding the pictures that every child has drawn and just looking through every picture you could see like machine gun tank and every child was holding this green picture in front of them

</details>

**Maria Verenova**: 学生们、他们的家长以及乌克兰的人权专家告诉我，俄罗斯的宣传确实起作用，一些孩子确实会上当，相信他们被告知的内容。例如，我采访的一个男孩告诉我，他确实开始相信是乌克兰发动了战争，因为他说，看到周围那么多成年人都在讲同样的故事，你就会开始相信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Verenova**: students. and their parents and human right experts in Ukraine told me that Russian propaganda does work and some children they do fall for it and believe in what they have been told. For example, one boy that I spoke with told me that he indeed started believing that Ukraine have started the war because he said that seeing so many grownups around me telling the same story, you start believing it.
