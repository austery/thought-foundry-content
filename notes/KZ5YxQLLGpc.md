我们今晚的计划，各位受邀嘉宾，相当简单。我们将探讨我们与中国目前的关系如何？与中国进行更多贸易的风险和机遇是什么？加拿大应该如何与中国接触？以及最终的重大问题，正如外交事务中所说，我们是否应该转向中国？这就是我们今晚的议程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our plan for tonight uh invited guests is pretty simple. We are going to ask where are we at with China? What are the risks and opportunities of dealing more with China? How should Canada approach engaging with China? And ultimately the big question, should we, as they say in foreign affairs, pivot to China? So that's on our itinerary tonight.</p>
</details>

在做这一切之前，我想对在场观众进行一次调查，了解大家的看法。我将问两个独立的问题。所以，请大家就这些问题举手示意。鉴于我们与美国的关系正在恶化，加拿大应该积极地与中华人民共和国重新接触。请举手，然后放下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we do all of that though, I want to survey this audience and get a sense of where everybody's at. I'm going to ask you two separate questions. So, let's see a show of hands on these questions. In light of our deteriorating relationship with the United States, Canada should actively re-engage with the People's Republic of China. Hands up and hands down.</p>
</details>

我们不共享相同的价值观。他们是一个专制独裁国家。我们不应该尝试转向中国。请举手。有意思。请放下。好的。第一个问题得到的“是”比第二个问题多得多。很高兴知道观众的想法，因为今晚结束时，我可能会再次调查大家，看看是否有人因为今晚的讨论而改变了主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't share the same values. They're an authoritarian dictatorship. We should not attempt to pivot to China. Hands up. Interesting. Hands down. Okay. A lot more yeses for the first question than there were for the second. Good to know what this audience thinks because at the end of the evening, I may just survey you again and see if anybody's minds have been changed by what transpired.</p>
</details>

与此同时，让我们先摆出一些事实，弄清楚我们的立场。2024年，加拿大向中国出口了300亿美元的产品，但我们进口了870亿美元。尽管如此，双方都存在高额关税。我们对电动汽车征收100%的关税，对钢铁征收25%的关税。中国对我们的菜籽油征收100%的关税，对猪肉和海鲜征收25%的关税。鉴于所有这些情况，让我们请前部长来谈谈。首先，作为贸易伙伴，中国目前对加拿大有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, let's get a few facts on the table here to figure out where we stand. In 2024, Canada exported $30 billion of products to China, but we imported $87 billion worth. That said, there are big tariffs going both ways. We have imposed 100% tariffs on EVs and 25% on steel. China has put 100% tariffs on our canola and 25% on pork and seafood. So with all of that in place, let's get the former minister to work. First of all, as a trading partner, how important is China to Canada right now?</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：嗯，中国一直是加拿大的第二大贸易伙伴，但我认为根据最新的数据，它现在是继欧洲之后的第三大贸易伙伴。所以我们有美国，我们有曾经的中国，然后是欧洲，现在情况反过来了。所以它是一个重要的世界经济体，中国从加拿大购买商品。我们向中国销售商品，而且，正如你所知，作为贸易部长，以及从加拿大企业的市场准入角度来看，我认为考虑这一点很重要，即有就业机会与这种贸易关系紧密相连。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: Well, China has been Canada's second largest trading partner and I think in the most recent numbers, they're now third after Europe. So we have United States, we have uh what was China, and then Europe, and now it's uh it's inversed. So it's a it's a significant economy in the world and China buys from Canada. We sell uh to China and uh and as you know as as a trade minister and as you know looking at it for Canadian businesses as a market to access I think it's important to consider that that there are jobs that are tied to that very trading relationship.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：这曾是您担任部长时的重要职责。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: This was a big part of your responsibilities when you were the minister.</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：没错。但话虽如此，加拿大人经常对我和政府说，我们进行贸易时，也重视对加拿大非常重要的价值观。例如法治价值观，例如我们在公平工资或环境问题上的立场，或者在人权等一系列对加拿大人来说非常重要的问题上的立场。这些价值观必须与经济关系相交织。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: Right. But having said that, Canadians have often said to me and to the government that we trade with values that are really important to Canada as well. Values like the rule of law, values like um like our position on um you know on fair wages or on the environment or on on issues of uh of of of you know a range of issues that are really important to Canadians around human rights. Those values have to intersect with an economic relationship</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：我们当然会在今晚的讨论中回顾并考虑这些问题。康斯坦丁，您如何回答关于中国作为贸易伙伴目前对我们重要性的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: and we shall come back and consider those of course during the course of our evening. Constantine, how would you answer the question about as a trading partner the importance of China to us right now?</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：毫无疑问，中国是一个重要的贸易伙伴，考虑到您之前对观众提出的问题，尤其是在我们与南方邻国（美国）的主要贸易关系似乎正在恶化的情况下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: There's no question that China is an important trading partner in view of your earlier question to the audience, especially now when it seems that our primary trading relationship with um our friends south of the border is deteriorating.</p>
</details>

加拿大是一个贸易国家。**多边主义**（Multilateralism: 涉及多个国家共同解决全球问题的外交原则）一直帮助着加拿大，我认为鉴于美国正在发生的一切，我们别无选择，只能寻求扩大与几乎所有其他国家的贸易，包括中国、欧洲、印度、亚太地区，最终我们需要走向市场所在、机遇所在的地方。所以，是的，中国是一个重要的伙伴，我认为它必然会成为一个更大的伙伴，因为我们与美国的贸易关系恶化对这个国家构成了生存问题，我们需要通过与我们过去曾有贸易往来、或许可以做得更多的国家进行贸易来平衡这种风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Canada is a trading state. Um, multilateralism has always helped Canada and I think in view of what's been going on uh with regards to uh to the United States, I think we have no choice but to look for expanding our trade with practically everybody else including China, including Europe, including India, the Asia Pacific and ultimately we need to go to where the markets are, where the opportunities are. Um so yes the uh I guess China is an important partner and I think invariably it will have to become a much bigger partner because the deterioration of our trading relationship with the the United States presents an existential issue for the country and we need to balance that risk u by trading with folks that you know we traded with in the past and perhaps we can do more.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：维娜，您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: What say you Vita? Well, first of all,</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：首先，很高兴能参加这个小组讨论。非常感谢您的邀请，我非常期待观众的提问。我认为当我们说中国是我们的第二大贸易伙伴时，我们必须认识到第一和第二之间的差距大约是70个百分点。所以从76%到不到4%的出口额来看，这几乎没有什么意义。我们与欧盟的贸易更多，与**CPTPP**（Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership: 全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定）成员国的贸易也更多。所以，是的，中国是一个重要的贸易伙伴，但我们必须正确理解这一点，我们也必须认识到，当我们与中国进行贸易时，也存在风险，特别是当我们对中国在某些贸易领域过度依赖时，比如菜籽油，当我们在外交或政治问题上与中国存在分歧时，我们就会面临潜在的报复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Well, first of all, it's wonderful to be on this panel. Thank you so much for the invitation and uh re really look forward to the questions from the audience. Uh I think when we say can China is our second largest trading partner, we have to recognize that the gap between number one and number two is about 70 points. So it almost means very little from 76% to less than 4% in terms of our exports. We trade with European Union more and we trade with the CPTP countries, the comprehensive progressive trans-pacific partnership agreement uh countries more. So yes, China is an important trading partner, but we have to rightsize the understanding of that and we also have to recognize that when we do trade with China, there are also risks involved and especially when we're overdependent on China for certain trade like in the sector like canola, we're opening ourselves to potential retaliation when there are disagreements with China on diplomatic or political issues.</p>
</details>

虽然鉴于美国变得如此具有破坏性，我们很想说我们需要转向并重新关注中国，但我认为我们必须谨慎。是的，在某些领域我们可以与中国进行更多合作，中国当然是世界第二大经济体。所以我们必须这样做，但我们必须谨慎。我们必须头脑清醒，并且在某种程度上深化与中国的贸易的同时，也要降低风险。因此，在那些我们过度依赖和脆弱的领域减少合作。在那些可能引发国家安全问题的关键领域减少合作，并关注亚洲的其他地区。亚洲不仅仅是中国。还有许多其他国家。我们必须多元化，我们必须减少对美国和中国的过度依赖。无论美国多么具有破坏性，我们都不要忘记，中国开始了导致我们目前这种危机的破坏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And while it is obviously tempting to say given that the US has become so disruptive, we need to pivot and look back at to China, I think we have to be cautious. Yes, there are sectors in which we can do with China more with China and China of course is the second largest economy in the world. So we will have to but we have to be cautious. We have to be cleareyed and we have to derisk at the same time as we deepen trade in some ways with China. So do less in sectors where we're overdependent and vulnerable. do less in critical sectors which can open up national security concerns and look at other parts of Asia. Asia is not just China. There are many other countries. We have to diversify and we have to reduce over reliance on both the US and China. However disruptive the US, let's not forget that China started the disruption that has led to the kind of crisis that we're in.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：莱内特，您对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Lynette, your view on this? You know, I</p>
</details>

莱内特：我认为中国正变得越来越重要，但我认为对于你之前提出的我们是否应该转向中国的问题，答案并非非黑即白。我不认为这是一个二选一的问题。我认为，你知道，在不确定性时代，特别是考虑到美国政府目前的情况，我们应该考虑分散风险。我想说，你知道，长期以来，如果我们从更长远的角度来看，加拿大一直生活在大国的边缘。我们一直是美国经济繁荣和政治稳定的受益者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: I think China is becoming more more important, but I think in answer to your earlier question about should we pivot towards China, I think the answer is not binary. I don't see that as an eitheror. I think you know in the age of uncertainty especially with what is going on in with the US administration right now. We should think about diversifying risk. Um I would suggest that you know for a long time if we take a longer view of things right I think Canada has been living in the margins of great power. We have been a beneficiary of economic prosperity and political stability in the United States.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：所以从这个意义上说，我们一直很自满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: So we have been complacent in that sense</p>
</details>

莱内特：没错，六个月前我们被这种自满惊醒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: right and you know six months ago we were jolted out of our complacency</p>
</details>

### 贸易多元化与“可变几何”策略

莱内特：现在我们正在思考是否应该转向中国的问题。我认为要问的问题是，在不确定性时代，我们如何才能真正实现经济伙伴关系和政治伙伴关系的多元化？我认为在政治伙伴关系方面，我们不应该看向中国，而应该看向欧洲和其他民主国家，正如总理最近与欧洲签署了关于军事开支的协议。但在经济伙伴关系方面，我认为中国是一个选择，而且是一个非常重要的选择，正如其他小组成员之前提到的，我们不应该止步于中国，而应该从中国开始，因为它是世界第二大市场。但除了中国，我们也应该考虑印太国家，如日本、东南亚、印度等等。所以我认为中国是一个很好的起点，但不应该是终点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: and now we are thinking about the question of whether or not we should pivot towards China. I think the question to to ask is is that in the age of uncertainty how do we actually diversify economic partnership and political partnership I think with political partnership we shouldn't be looking towards China we should be looking towards a with uh Europe and other democratic countries as the prime the prime minister has signed a deal with with uh Europe with respect to military um spending recently but economic partnership. I think China is an option and is a very important option and as other panelists have alluded to earlier, China, we shouldn't stop at China, but we should start with China because it is the second largest market. But aside from China, we should also be thinking about Indopacific countries such as Japan, such as Southeast Asia, such as India, so on and so forth. So I would say China is a good place to start but it is it shouldn't be the place to end.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：玛丽，过去六十年加拿大与中国的关系一直引人入胜。我们中的一些人还记得**皮埃尔·特鲁多**（Pierre Trudeau: 加拿大前总理，早于美国与中国建立外交关系）总理在美国之前就向中国开放，这些年来我们的关系起起伏伏。在**让·克雷蒂安**（Jean Chrétien: 加拿大前总理，任内推动“加拿大团队”访华）执政期间，通过“加拿大团队”出访，关系变得相当好。在**贾斯汀·特鲁多**（Justin Trudeau: 加拿大现任总理）执政初期，关系一度变得很糟。然后我们听到**马克·卡尼**（Mark Carney: 加拿大前央行行长，现任加拿大总理）在领导人辩论中说了几件不同的事情，当时他正在竞选，他曾说中国是加拿大未来面临的最大问题，现在他谈论战略伙伴关系，一个转折点，他将访问中国。我们如何看待这一切？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Mary, it's been fascinating to watch the Canadian Chinese relationship over the last let's say 60 years. Some of us can remember when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau opened to China before the United States did and our relationship had its ups and downs over the years. It got pretty good under Jean Kretchan with the team Canada trips. It got pretty bad under Justin Trudeau for a while and then we heard Mark Carney say a couple of different things during the leaders debate when he was running for he was the prime minister running to keep his job he said China was the biggest you know the biggest problem he envisaged for Canada's future now he talks about strategic partnership a turning point and he's going to visit shei what do we make of all of that</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：所以，我同意维娜之前关于我们需要以一种真正平衡加拿大作为规则民主国家的利益以及存在的经济利益和机遇的方式来进入这种关系的说法。关于你提出的关于转向的问题，我也同意这不是一个非此即彼的选择。我认为，鉴于当今存在的地缘政治逆风，我认为你看到卡尼总理正在采取一种务实的方法来抓住经济机遇，同时，我认为他并没有改变他在那场辩论中采取的立场。我们确实必须考虑当今的问题。当你考虑贸易时，它不仅仅是一个新市场或一个扩大市场。我们希望做更多的服务。我们希望做更多的商品。它不是那样的。我的意思是，今天当你谈论贸易时，你也在谈论数据和人工智能的贸易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: so um I would agree with um you know with what Vina was saying a little earlier about um about needing to enter into this relationship in a way that really does balance the interests for Canada as a rules-based democracy and to the economic interests and opportunities that are there. To your question about uh you know about the pivot, I I I also agree it is not a it's not an eitheror. I think that given the geopolitical headwinds that exist today, I think what you're seeing in Prime Minister Carney do is take a pragmatic approach around the economic opportunity while at the same time I don't think he has uh I don't think that the position he took in that debate has also changed. We do have to consider the issues today. Uh when you think about trade, it isn't just let's it's a new market or an expanded market. We're looking to do more services. we're looking to do more goods. It is not like that. I mean, today when you're talking about trade, you're also talking about trade in data and AI</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：以及关键基础设施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: and critical infrastructure,</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：不仅仅是制成品，还有**关键矿产**（Critical Minerals: 对高科技产业和国家安全至关重要的矿产资源）。所以，你谈论的是广泛的贸易，但同时，你也在谈论旅游业、教育、农业食品以及加拿大所能提供的一切美好事物。所以这些是我们在加拿大思考这种关系时必须考虑的权衡。我认为这种关系有其附加值，我认为我们应该以开放的心态来处理它。但就多元化而言，我认为加拿大作为一个中等强国，与CPTPP中的伙伴国合作，正如维娜所说，CPTPP包括日本、新加坡、澳大利亚、新西兰、越南、马来西亚等遵循规则的国家。在我担任部长期间，英国已加入。哥斯达黎加目前正在经历这一过程。你知道，像印度尼西亚这样的国家，那是我与印度尼西亚谈判的最后一个协议。这些经济体在基于规则的系统下，在CPTPP伙伴关系下，有贸易规则。因此，当贸易伙伴之间发生争议时，有争议解决系统，并且有管理贸易方式的规则。例如，如何在数字贸易中处理数据治理？这些都是加拿大人需要思考的问题，当然，政府在制定贸易政策时也需要考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: not just manufactured goods and and and critical minerals. So, you are talking about trade that is broad, but at the same time, you're also talking about tourism, you're talking about education, you're talking about agra foods and all the great things that Canada has uh has to offer. So those are the puts and takes that we have to consider in Canada as you think about this relationship. I think that there are that there are additives to the relationship and I think that there are there are uh there there is a eyes wide open approach to how you step through it. But to the point of diversification, I think that Canada as a middle power country with partners in the CPTP, as Vina said, CPTP includes countries like Japan, like Singapore, like Australia, like New Zealand, like Vietnam, like Malaysia that are in a rules-based structure. The United Kingdom has seeded to it when I was the minister. Costa Rica is going through that right now. they are, you know, countries like Indonesia, which uh that was the last agreement I negotiated with with Indonesia. Um these are economies where under a rules-based system, under a CPTP partnership, there are rules for how we trade. So there's a disputes uh resolution system when there is a dispute to be had among the trading partners and there are rules to which you govern how you do your trade. How do you deal with data governance in digital trade for example among the partners? Those are the very issues that that uh that Canadians need to think about and uh and that certainly government when they're making policy trade polic</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：你是否清楚加拿大现任总理的立场？因为他在领导人辩论中说了一件事，但现在却说了不同的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: are you clear in your mind where the prime current prime minister of Canada stands in as much as he said one thing during the leaders debate but he's saying different things now</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：我认为这两件事可以同时成立。所以，中国确实对我们的国家安全和经济安全利益构成威胁。我们可以对此进行深入探讨。与此同时，显然，我们确实需要与中国在最高外交层面重新接触，以管理这种关系。所以，卡尼总理的意思是，我们需要与所有国家对话，包括那些我们存在严重分歧的国家。但分歧并没有消失。仅仅因为**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）表现得很刻薄，并没有让中国变得更好，对吧？对吧？所以，我的意思是，我们必须能够同时思考多重问题。因此，关于中国，他提出的是，在利益一致的某些事情上，我们可以做得更多。对吧？所以他有这种**可变几何**（Variable Geometry: 一种根据共同利益而非共同价值观建立伙伴关系的外交策略）的参与框架，对吧？这将适用于我们建立的某种利益联盟。但对于某些国家，我们将建立更多关系，因为价值观和利益一致。对于像中国这样的某些国家，我们可能有一些利益一致，但我们必须头脑清醒，我们的价值观不一致，我们的政治制度不一致，而且在“解放日”关税之前我们与中国存在的所有分歧仍然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: I think both things can be true at the same time. So, China does represent a threat to our national security and to our economic security interests as well. And we can unpack that. At the same time, obviously, we do need to re-engage with China at the highest level diplomatically to be able to manage that relationship. So, what Prime Minister Carney is saying is that we need to talk to all countries including those with whom we have serious disagreements. But the disagreements have not gone away. Just because President Trump is being really mean hasn't made China any better, right? Right? So like I mean we have to be able to hold multiple things in our heads. And so with respect to China, what he's proposing is that we can do more on certain things where interests align. Right? So he has this frame framework of variable geometry of engagement, right? That that will apply also to kind of coalitions of uh interests that we will build. But also with certain countries, we'll have more relationships because values and interests align. With certain countries like China, we may have certain interests that align, but we have to be cleareyed that our values do not, our political systems do not, and all the disagreements that we had before the liberation day tariffs are still there with China.</p>
</details>

现在挑战在于，即使是选择性接触，即使是说我们想在气候变化上与中国做更多事情，我们想通过**TMX**（TMX: Trans Mountain Expansion Project，跨山输油管道扩建项目）或**LG加拿大**（LG Canada: 可能是指LG能源在加拿大投资的电池厂）向他们出售更多的能源出口，我们必须认识到，我们可能希望将问题分门别类处理，但中国不会这样做。**中国共产党**（Chinese Communist Party: 中华人民共和国的执政党）通常不会分门别类处理问题，如果他们对你有什么问题，就像他们现在对日本一样，因为总理对反对党议员提问的回答，他们就会通过限制游客旅行来针对你。他们会通过禁止某些出口商品的销售来针对你。换句话说，中国确实会将问题联系起来，并利用贸易中的依赖性作为武器。所以即使在能源等问题上，我们也必须头脑清醒，不应该过度依赖。我想这是我们从当前经验中学到的最终教训，即在当前环境下，过度依赖任何贸易伙伴，即使是像美国这样曾经可靠的伙伴，也是一个坏主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the challenge becomes because even with selective engagement even saying we want to do more with China on climate change we want to sell them more of our energy exports uh from TMX or from LG Canada we have to recognize that we may wish to compartmentalize but China doesn't do that the Chinese Communist Party does not generally compartmentalize if they have an issue with you like they do now with Japan over what the prime minister said in response to a question from an opposition member of parliament they then target you by limiting travel of tourists. They travel you by by they put a ban on sale of certain uh exports. So in other words, China does connect issues and does weaponize dependence in trade. So even on issues like energy, we have to be cleareyed that we shouldn't become overdependent. I guess that's the final sort of lesson that we've learned from the current experience is overdependence on any trading partner even one that used to be reliable like the US is a bad idea in the current environment.</p>

</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：我们最初通过收购中国两家稀土生产厂的控股权开始。我们扩大了这项业务，两年前我退休时，我们在全球拥有10家工厂，包括安大略省彼得伯勒的一家。我们的总部设在加拿大安大略省多伦多。我们在泰国、韩国、爱沙尼亚和德国都有工厂。所以我们建立了一家全球公司，但我们从中国那两家工厂开始，我们参与那些“加拿大团队”任务对我们的发展产生了巨大的影响。

Uh we had plants in Thailand uh Korea uh Estonia and uh Germany. So we we established a global company but we started in China with those two plans and our participation in those team Canada missions made a massive difference to to how we developed.</p>

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: So those were the good old days. What what would you call what's going on today?</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：嗯，我们正在从糟糕的日子中恢复，尽管我们经历过起伏。我的意思是，与中国的关系并非一帆风顺。在克雷蒂安时期，那是一个增长期。然后，在哈珀执政初期，事情放缓了，我记得当贝尔德部长开始访问中国并开始修补关系时，情况又好转了。然后当然，在特鲁多执政期间，显然发生了“两个迈克尔”事件，但我们作为一个国家的行为方式，我，你知道，在朋友之间，我称之为我们“自摆乌龙”。我认为现在有了卡尼总理，我认为国际关系的处理方式更加成熟了。听着，我的意思是，在我看来，即使我不是他的忠实粉丝，我也会遵循**亨利·基辛格**（Henry Kissinger: 美国前国务卿，著名外交家）所说的，国家只有利益，没有朋友。所以，我们需要决定什么符合国家利益。如果我们遇到不符合加拿大利益的问题，那么我们必须睁大眼睛，清醒地认识到正在发生什么，并绝对保持警惕。我没有听到任何人主张我们应该不设障碍、不加批判地全面扩大与中国的关系。我认为现在正确的主张是，我们需要睁大眼睛去接触。我认为这适用于与世界上每个国家的关系，顺便说一句，我不想占用太多时间。亨利·基辛格还说过另一句话，再次，你知道，它刻在我的脑海里，特别是自从特朗普最新上任以来，那就是：成为美国的敌人非常危险，成为朋友是致命的，不幸的是我们正发现自己处于这种境地。

<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: Um it's it's we're recovering from the bad days although we've seen ups and downs. I mean the the relationship with China has not been smooth all the way. Um during the creten years it was a period of growth. Um then during the initial part of the Harper years things slowed down and uh I remember things picked up again when Minister Baird started going to China and started mending that relationship. Um and then of course during the uh the Trudeau years there was obviously the the two Michaels but we behaved as a country in ways that I I you know among friends I call it we scored in our own net. Um, and I think now with with Prime Minister Carney, um, I think there's a bit more of a mature approach to international relations. And listen, I mean, I in my view, I even though I'm not a huge fan of him, I I go by what Henry Kissinger said that states have interests that don't have friends. So, we need to decide what's in the national interest. And if we come across issues that are not in the interest uh of Canada, then we have to be wideeyed um cognizant of what's going on and absolutely vigilant. And I haven't heard anybody advocate that we should go all in on the Chinese relationship expanding with no barriers, with no critical thinking. I think what we're what is being advocated correctly that we need to go in with our eyes wide open. I think that applies to every relationship with every state in the world and by the way I don't want to monopolize the time. Um the other thing that um Henry Kissinger said that again I you know it's engraved in the back of my head for especially since the latest uh Trump uh incarnation uh is that to be a friend of the United States to be an enemy of the United States is very risky. to be a friend is lethal and that's what we're finding ourselves unfortunately.</p>

所以在我停止之前，我再说一件事。作为一家上市公司首席执行官，我总是要求我们公司披露任何客户依赖性，如果您的收入超过总收入的10%。所以在商业世界中，对于上市公司而言，对任何单一客户的10%依赖性都是一种风险，您必须讨论如何解决或正在采取什么措施来保护股东的利益。

<p class="english-text">So I'll say one more thing uh before I stop. As a public company CEO um I always had our company had to disclose um any dependency with any customer where your revenues were more than 10% of uh your total revenues.

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: right?</p>
</details>

莱内特：我们是一个中等强国，因为我们是价格接受者。我们不能制定规则。所以当我们与像美国这样非常敌对或难以捉摸的强国，或者像中国这样的国家打交道时，加拿大作为一个中等强国，我们通常必须依靠多边机构，因为规则是稳定的。但现在像联合国、世贸组织这样的多边机构不再那么可靠。

史蒂夫·佩辛：我们该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: what do we do?</p>
</details>

莱内特：我们需要依靠总理卡尼所说的这些“自愿联盟”。但我认为已经发生的事情，你知道，给你一些“自愿联盟”的例子，比如反对任意拘留，反对中国对关键矿产的垄断。这些都是非常事后的措施。当事情发生时，我们才考虑组建联盟。但我认为我们应该预先思考，组建那些实际上遭受过中国贸易胁迫的联盟，比如韩国、日本、澳大利亚等等，并交流经验，讨论当我们遇到这些问题时如何处理。所以我认为，你知道，每个人都提到了市场多元化的问题。我会说，作为一个商人，这实际上是说起来容易做起来难，因为经济体喜欢规模经济的概念。我们希望扩大规模，因为我们可以降低成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: We need to rely on these what Marani the prime minister call ad hoc coalition of the willing. But I think what has happened you know to give you some examples of the coalition of the willing such as against arbitrary detention against China's monopoly of critical minerals. These are very um post um exposed measures. When things happen then we think about putting the coalition together. But I think we should be preemptively thinking is bring together coalition such as those that have actually suffered trade coercion against from China such as South Korea, Japan, uh Australia, so on and so forth and exchange notes about how do we deal with these problems when we uh face these issues. So I think you know everyone has touched on the issue of diversification of market. I would argue that as a business person, it's actually easier said than done because economies like the idea of economies of scale. We want to scale it up because we can lower the cost.</p>

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Yeah.</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：你可以看到我们这个小组有很多观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: you can see we have a lot of views on this panel.</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：嗯，史蒂夫，我在那篇评论文章中发现一件有趣的事情是，尽管总理谈到了这些基于利益的联盟，但他给出的例子都集中在欧洲。所以他谈到了针对乌克兰的“自愿联盟”。他谈到了加拿大现在加入的“安全欧洲”采购计划。他甚至谈到了将玛丽提到的CPTPP贸易集团与欧盟对接，以便它们共同创造能够与美国和中国匹敌的规模。所以在一个美国和中国都变得保护主义、不遵守规则的时代，小国必须团结起来，而两个最大的集团将是欧盟和CPTPP。然后，他在整篇评论文章中提到中国的一个地方是关于气候的，他说我们可以在气候问题上建立一个联盟，利用中国和印度的技术，欧洲的规则，以及巴西的方法或类似的东西，对吧？但这有点像一个愿望清单。它不存在，也没有人真正谈论它。所以有趣的是，即使在那次对话中，它也较少关于中国。更多的是关于多元化，并与非主要大国建立更深层次的关系。基本上，既不与美国也不与中国合作，以建立基于规则的贸易，这样我们作为一个中等规模的国家就能拥有发言权，我们就能以一种更具保护性的方式行使我们的利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Um, one thing that I found interesting in that oped, Steve, is that while the prime minister talks about these interest-based coalitions, the examples that he gives are all Europe focused. So he talks about the coalition of the willing visav Ukraine. He talks about safe Europe in terms of procurement that Canada has now joined. Uh he even talks about docking the CPTP trading block uh that Mary spoke about with the EU so that together they can create scale that actually matches US and China. So at a time when both US and China have become protectionists, don't follow rules, smaller countries have to come together and the two biggest blocks would be EU and CPTP. So and then one place where he mentions China in that entire op-ed is to do with climate and he says that we can have a coalition around climate that sort of uses Chinese and Indian technology and European rules and Brazilian sort of approach or something, right? But that's kind of like a wish list. It doesn't exist and nobody's really talking about it. So the interesting thing is that even in that conversation, it's less about China. It's more about diversifying and building deeper relationship with other non- major powers. Basically with neither the US nor China to be able to create rules-based trading where we actually as a middlesized country have a voice and we can exercise our interest in a kind of in a way that's more protective.</p>
</details>

所以，我最后要提的一点是，是的，我们75%的贸易是与美国进行的，我们必须实现多元化，但与中国，我们已经存在过度依赖。所以，我们很容易就说，你知道，我们需要处理农业关税。我们必须继续向他们出售菜籽油。嗯，我们已经多次经历菜籽油贸易中断。我们必须吸取教训。这就像“一次被骗，下次小心”对吧？所以我们不能继续向那个市场出售63%的菜籽。所以我们必须实现多元化，提升价值链。我们的某些海产品也是如此。97%销往中国市场。我明白。这是一个更容易的市场，但我们现在必须做艰苦的工作。我们必须认识到，如果我们与中国在其他问题上存在分歧，中国会进行报复。台湾、乌克兰，所有这些都联系在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and then a final thing that I'll mention is yes, it's true that 75% of our trade is with the US and we have to diversify that, but with China, we have overdependencies already. So, and it would be easy for us to just say, you know, we need to deal with the agricultural tariffs. We have to continue to sell canola to them. Well, we've had disruptions to canola trade multiple times already. We have to learn the lesson. It's like fool me once, right? So we cannot continue to sell 63% of our canola seed to that market. So we have to diversify, move up the value chain. Same thing in terms of some of our seafood products. 97% going to China market. I get it. It's an easier market, but we have to do the hard work now. And we have to be cognizant that China will retaliate if we disagree with them on other issues. Taiwan, Ukraine, all linked.</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：所有这些都联系在一起。玛丽。

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: It's all linked. Mary.</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：所以，嗯，多元化工作，我完全同意对于企业来说。他们宁愿进入一个单一市场。这样做容易得多，但我想说，在我担任贸易部长的整个任期内，我从未有过一个不包含多元化内容的任务。所以，在2018年，总理交给我的任务是到2025年将非美国出口额增加50%。这大约是2910亿美元。我们已经做到了。我们已经谈判了协议。如果你考虑CPTPP，它覆盖了亚洲市场的一大片区域，不包括美国，也不包括中国。我们正在与**东南亚国家联盟**（ASEAN: 旨在促进东南亚地区经济、政治、安全、军事、教育、社会和文化合作的地区组织）进行谈判。顺便说一句，所有这些国家加起来有7亿人口。CPTPP有5亿人口。所以你谈论的是大约10亿人口，这还不包括中国和美国。所以，对于多边合作，这基本上就是我们一直在努力的工作，对吧？我的意思是，在规则的基础上创建贸易集团，允许市场准入，但也允许处理诸如如何在经济中对待工人等问题，以便实现公平贸易，因为在加拿大，当出现某种产品的倾销时，我的意思是，它会压低价格，并使我们的公司竞争力下降。这些问题实际上是在贸易谈判桌上处理的，而贸易伙伴会谈判这些规则，并决定我们将如何相互接触，然后你还有争议解决机制，你也会受到这些机制的约束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: So, um, the work of diversification, I absolutely agree for businesses. They would much rather go into one single market. It's way easier to do, but I would say I have never had a mandate in my entire time as trade minister that did not have diversification in it. So, in 2018, the mandate the prime minister gave to me was increase your non- US exports by 50% by 2025. That was sort of in the order of about $291 billion. We've done it. We've negotiated agreements. If you think about the CPTPP, that covers a gigantic swath of Asian markets that does not include the United States, nor does it include China. We are at the negotiating table with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. By the way, all of them added up is 700 million people. Uh CPTPP 500 million people. So you're talking in there sort of you're heading towards about a billion a billion people and that's without China and without uh and without the United States. So and and and to the plural laterals that is essentially the work that we have been building on right I mean creating trading blocks on a foundation of rules that allow market access but that allow for things like how do you how do you treat your workers within your economy so that there is actually fair trade because in Canada when you have a over you know an a dumping of let's say a product right I mean it depresses the prices and it you know and and and it makes our companies less competitive. Those issues are actually dealt with at the trade negotiating table whereas trading partners you negotiate those rules and you decide these are these are this is what we're going to this is how we're going to engage with one another and then you've got dispute resolution mechanisms that you are then bound by as well.</p>

所以我认为加拿大处于一个很好的位置。为什么？因为目前凭借我们现有的贸易协定，我们已经可以通过**CETA**（Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement: 加拿大与欧盟之间的全面经济和贸易协定）集团、CPTPP和印度尼西亚（世界第四人口大国，现已完成）进入世界经济的65%。印度将要开始工作。**东盟**（ASEAN: 东南亚国家联盟）作为一个集团也将要开始工作。顺便说一句，东盟的谈判始于2016年。东盟指的是东南亚国家。

### 中国贸易逆差与加拿大产业战略

史蒂夫·佩辛：好的，我来提醒大家我之前说的数字。2024年，加拿大向中国出口了300亿美元，进口了870亿美元。所以，莱内特，我的问题是，他们真的想从我们这里买东西，还是只想卖东西给我们？

<p class="english-text">Lynette: Well, you know, China is a much larger country compared to in Canada, right? And I would actually suggest that the straw poll that you took at the beginning of the audience, the results are actually not reflective of the Canadian public.</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：没错。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: That's right.</p>

莱内特：对。我认为观众，如果我可以用这个词的话，是自我选择的。那些来参加这个活动的人，他们实际上比普通加拿大人更亲华。所以我认为框架问题，你说马克·卡尼在作为政治候选人时说了不同的话，而现在他作为总理决策者则非常不同，但他的身份确实改变了。但我认为，在推销中国时，我们应该以很多细微差别来接触中国，这一点也很重要，那就是我们如何真正地构建这场辩论，这将是我的建议，我认为，你知道，公众对中国的看法在过去六个月里发生了剧烈变化。现在对华盛顿特区不利的人比对北京不利的人更多。这对中国有利。另一件事是，我认为我们应该把中国视为一个非常细致的、非常细致的立场。我认为随着形势的变化，我们不应该，我想说，不应该一直谈论价值观。所以一位**不列颠哥伦比亚大学**（UBC: University of British Columbia，加拿大著名大学）法学教授说，我们应该从最大化加拿大利益的角度来构建这场辩论，包括条约义务、人权条约义务，我绝对同意，因为这样像中国这样的国家就不能说我们站在道德制高点上批评他们，因为我们只是在最大化我们的利益。我想，如果我是总理，我不是，我也无权向他提供建议。但如果我有这个荣幸，我会对他说，想想你如何真正地推销与中国接触的问题。框架至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: Right. I think the audience, if I could use that word, is a self is a self-selected one. Those people who come who come to this event, they actually more pro-China than your average Canadians. So I think the issue of framing so you say that Mark Carney say different thing when he was a political candidate and he's now a prime minister decision maker is very different but his status has actually changed. But I think what what is also important in I think selling China that we should engage China with a lot of nuances is how we actually frame that debate and this would be my suggestions and I think you know public opinion with respect to China has changed drastically in the last six months. There are now more people unfavorable towards Washington DC than towards Beijing. That's in China's favor. And the other thing is that I think we should think about uh China as a very nuance as a very nuance uh position. I think with the shifting of the sand um we should not I would say not keep talking about values. So a UBC law professor say that we should frame the debate in terms of maximizing Canadians interest including treaty obligations obligations to human rights treaty which I would absolutely agree because then countries like China cannot say that we stand on uh moral high grounds and criticize them because we are just maximizing our interest. I I think I I if I'm the prime minister, which I am not, I'm also not in a position of advising him. But if I have the privilege, I would say to him that think about how you actually sell the question of engagement with China. The framing is critical.</p>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：嗯，我的经验是，在中国，在中国的消费者中，加拿大是一个很棒的品牌。他们想购买食品。他们想购买，我们出口这么多鱼是有原因的，因为中国消费者想要加拿大的鱼。他们想要加拿大的产品。嗯，**始祖鸟**（Arcterics: 加拿大高端户外品牌）是一个巨大的品牌。它不再是加拿大的了，但它是一个巨大的品牌。在中国，人们对加拿大的产品有一种亲和力，你知道，我们需要继续努力，这就是为什么，你知道，加拿大食品在中国的出口量如此之大。

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: what do you mean scary?</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：嗯，大约一个月前我在北京，在我的一次会议之后。我走进**小米**（Xiaomi: 中国一家以智能手机、智能硬件和电动汽车为核心业务的科技公司）的一家电动汽车经销商。我被在中国花5万美元能买到的东西震惊了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: I um I was in Beijing about a month ago after one of my meetings. I walked into uh an EV dealership by um Xiaomi. I was blown away what you can buy in China for $50,000.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：我想这就是对中国电动汽车征收100%关税的目的，是为了保护我们免受其害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: And this is I guess what the 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs are designed to protect us from</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：假设这些关税是经过深思熟虑的，而不是对美国征收100%关税的某种反射性反应。这对我来说有点痛点，因为欧洲人在经过两年研究后，对进入欧洲的中国电动汽车征收了17%到42%的关税，他们对每家电动汽车生产商都设定了不同的关税税率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: assuming that there was any thinking going into those tariffs as opposed to some reflexive uh reaction to what the Americans did when they imposed 100% tariffs. And that actually is is is a bit of a sore point for me because the Europeans had imposed tariffs after two years of study between 17% and 42% on Chinese EVs into Europe and they went through all the producers of EVs and they had a different tariff rate for each producer.</p>
</details>

我们，你知道，美国一征收100%的关税，我们就立刻跟进，没有任何思考，没有任何，我不知道，我假设没有任何思考，因为它几乎是反射性的。然而，我们本可以采取一种更具分析性的方法，顺便说一句，中国政府尊重数据，你知道，欧洲的系统会提供数据，虽然帮助不大，但我们仍然有很多选择。所以当我们对中国电动汽车征收100%的关税时，顺便说一句，我们加拿大还没有生产任何电动汽车。我们期望会发生什么？我的意思是，如果我们对美国或德国生产商征收关税，会发生什么？他们难道不会对我们的产品进行报复性关税吗？我的意思是，事情就是这样运作的。所以，中国人想买东西吗？是的，当然。但你看，他们想买有助于他们自己产业发展的东西。所以我们需要弄清楚我们可以向他们出售哪些材料和产品，这些产品既符合加拿大的利益，也符合中国的利益。

Uh what did we expect to happen? I mean, what would have happened if we imposed tariffs on American or German producers? Uh would they have not retaliated with tariffs on our products? I mean, that's the way it works. So, do the Chinese want to buy stuff? Yes, of course. But you see, they want to buy stuff that helps their own industry. So we need to figure out what are the materials and the products that we can sell to them that you know fit both the Canadian interest and the Chinese interest.</p>

### 历史回顾与当前挑战

史蒂夫·佩辛：好的，我们已经进行到一半了。所以现在我要做一次回顾。我们提醒大家我们在这里做什么。我们现在在多伦多市中心历史悠久的圣劳伦斯大厅。你知道吗？**约翰·A·麦克唐纳爵士**（Sir John A. Macdonald: 加拿大首任总理）曾在这个大厅里演讲。**乔治·布朗**（George Brown: 加拿大联邦之父之一）曾在这个大厅里演讲。**托马斯·达西·麦吉**（Thomas Darcy McGee: 加拿大联邦之父之一）曾在这个大厅里演讲。不，我没有报道过任何这些演讲，尽管你可能会这么认为。但我确实记得我上一次在这个大厅里是41年前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Okay, we're about halfway through here. So this is the point where I do what's called a rrackcking. We remind everybody what we're doing here. We are here in downtown Toronto in the historic St. Lawrence Hall. You know what? Sir John A. Macdonald spoke in this hall. George Brown spoke in this hall. Thomas Darcy McGee spoke in this hall. No, I did not cover any of those speeches despite what what you might think. But I do remember the last time I was in this hall was 41 years ago</p>
</details>

当时加拿大进步保守党有一位新领导人名叫**布莱恩·马尔罗尼**（Brian Mulroney: 加拿大前总理），他来到这里发表演讲，我报道了那场演讲，就在这个大厅里，那真是太棒了。这里的历史无处不在。总之，我们今晚谈论的是非常不同的事情。我们谈论的是中国，加拿大与中国未来的关系。我想提醒大家我们的嘉宾是谁。康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯，加中贸易理事会董事会成员；维娜·纳吉布拉，加拿大亚太基金会副总裁；玛丽·吴，加拿大前国际贸易部长；以及莱内特教授，多伦多大学和蒙克国际研究中心。维娜，我将在这里继续对话，也就是说，长期以来有一种观点认为，如果我们向中国开放，如果我们与中国贸易，如果我们努力使与中国的关系更加正常化，他们就会自由化。天知道，他们甚至可能变得更加民主。

<details>

<p class="english-text">when there was a new leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada named Brian Maloney who came here to give a speech and I covered that speech in this hall and it's magnificent. The history here is just everywhere. Anyway, we are talking something very different tonight. We're talking China, Canada's relationship with China going forward. And I want to remind everybody who our guests are. Can Constantine Karionopoulos, board member at the Canada China Business Council, Vina Najibula, Vice President, Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, Mary, former Minister of International Trade for Canada, and Professor Lynette, University of Toronto and the Monk School. Vina, I'm going to pick up the conversation here, which is to say there was a school of thought for a very long time that if we open to China, if we trade with China, if we try to make things more normal with China, they will liberalize. Goodness knows, they might even become more democratic.</p>

维娜·纳吉布拉：是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Yes.</p>

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Is there anybody who believes any of that anymore?</p>

维娜·纳吉布拉：嗯，我最近没有遇到过他们，所以可能还有一些人相信，但我认为大多数人。

<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Uh, I haven't met them recently, so there might be still some people who believe that, but I think most</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：那么，这样做值得吗？大多数人会同意，即使在当时，那也可能是天真的。如果有什么不同的话，我的意思是，如果你现在看，我们正变得越来越像中国，因为我们都回到了产业战略和产业政策。我们在某些方面都变得更加保护主义和重商主义。所以，这个实验是否以另一种方式奏效，我认为现在是一个更有趣的问题。所以，不，我不认为与中国的经济整合和接触导致了任何民主发展。当然，在过去十年中没有。我的意思是，我们可以深入探讨发生了什么和没有发生什么。那是一个更大的问题。但是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: So, is it worth doing then? Most would agree that that was probably naive even at the time. And if anything, I mean, if you look now, we're becoming more like China in that we're all resorting back to industrial strategy and industrial policy. We're all becoming more protectionists and more mercantalists in some ways. So whether or not the experiment worked in the other way is I think more interesting question right now. So no, I don't think the economic uh integration and engagement with China led to any democratic development. Certainly not in the last 10 years. I mean we can we can unpack what happened and did not happen. That's a bigger question. But</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：但这确实使中国数亿人摆脱了贫困。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: but it did bring hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in China.</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：绝对如此。我认为这很大程度上归功于中国人民的辛勤工作，而不是中国共产党的政策，甚至也不是与世界的接触。所以我的意思是，我认为所有这些都是事实，但我们必须回到你提出的问题。中国想从加拿大购买任何东西吗？我认为这是一个重要问题，因为中国的增长模式非常依赖出口。所以贸易顺差超过1万亿美元，而且还在增长。事实上，即使美国市场现在对中国关闭，他们也向欧洲销售更多。他们向东南亚销售更多。他们向非洲、拉丁美洲销售更多，他们也想向我们销售更多他们的产品，包括电动汽车。康斯坦丁说得绝对正确。但我们必须开始思考，我们希望加拿大在未来10年、20年、30年拥有什么样的经济？我们如何保持我们的生活水平？我们如何保持一个繁荣的发达国家？我们必须继续工业化。我们必须继续投资未来的技术，而不仅仅是出售我们得天独厚的原材料。所以，是的，中国想购买我们的东西，就像他们也想从俄罗斯购买石油一样，就像他们想从我们这里购买原材料一样。但我们是想继续销售这些产品，还是真的想成为一个真正的工业化国家？如果这是问题，那么与中国更深入的接触会导致问题。我们现在在欧洲和东南亚其他地方也看到了这些问题。对吧？他们也担心，如果中国继续补贴、继续操纵市场、操纵其货币，并做它一直以来非常有效地做到的一切，以达到今天的地位，他们是否有机会发展自己的制造业和国内经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Absolutely. And I think a lot of that is due to the hard work of the Chinese people rather than necessarily the policies of the Chinese Communist Party or even the engagement with the world. So I mean I think all of that is true but we have to go back to the question that you asked. Does China want to buy anything from Canada? I think that is an important question in that the Chinese growth model very much is exportd driven. So more than $1 trillion of surplus in trade and it's growing. In fact, even though the US market is now closing to China, they're selling more to Europe. They're selling more to Southeast Asia. They're selling more to Africa, Latin America, and they would like to sell us more of their stuff, too, including EVs. Constantine is absolutely right. But we have to start thinking about what kind of economy do we want to have in Canada 10, 20, 30 years from now. How do we maintain our status of living? How do we stay a prosperous developed country? We have to continue to industrialize. We have to to continue to invest in technologies of tomorrow, not just sell the raw materials with which we've been blessed. So yes, China wants to buy our stuff in the same way that they want to buy oil from Russia as well, in the same way way that they want to buy raw materials from us. But do we want to just continue to sell those products or do we actually want to become a proper industrialized country? And if that is the question, then deeper engagement with China leads to problems. Problems that we're now seeing elsewhere in Europe as well as in Southeast Asia. Right? They're also worried about can they have a chance of developing their own manufacturing and domestic economy if China continues to subsidize, continues to manipulate the market, manipulate its currency and do everything that it has done very effectively to get to where it is.</p>
</details>

莱内特：嗯，你知道，我认为贸易是比较优势的体现。我们不向中国销售制成品是有原因的，因为他们的劳动力成本要低得多，对吧？我认为这是一条经济学规则。我不确定我是否认同特朗普的观点，即每个国家都应该工业化，应该拥有比中国更多的工厂。我认为，我认为国家之间进行贸易是有原因的，我们的比较优势在于农业和服务业，这些是我们向中国销售的东西，他们向我们销售制成品。嗯，你知道，我不确定工业化是否是每个国家的出路，因为经济学、比较优势和劳动力成本在理论上是这样运作的，莱内特，我完全同意你的看法，在理想世界中，一旦你达到一定水平，工资必须上涨，生活水平必须提高，你的货币也必须升值，但当一个国家实际上控制所有这些要素时，我的意思是，你知道，据我所知，现在中国的消费者权力较小。他们可以花更多的钱。工资受到压制。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lynette: Well, you know, I think trade is a reflection of comparative advantage. there are reason why we are not selling manufactured goods to China because they are much lower cheaper labor costs right I think that's a rule of economics um I'm I am not sure whether I I buy Trump's argument of you know every country should become industrialized should have more factories than China I think I think there are reasons why countries trade with each other our comparative advantage lies with the agricultural sector and services and that's those are the things that we sell we sell China and they sell manufactured goods to us. um you know I'm not sure you know industrialization is the way to go for every countries um because of way economics and comparative advantage and labor cost cause works in theory that's in theory the case Lynette I completely agree with you that in ideal world once you sort of move to a certain level the wages have to go up and standard of living have to go up and your currency has to appreciate as well but when a state actually controls all those elements I mean you know as much as I know that in China right Now the consumers are less empowered.

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：我可以告诉你，世界上只有两家工厂在中国境外以商业大规模生产稀土。一家在马来西亚，由一家澳大利亚公司拥有；另一家在欧洲的爱沙尼亚，由我的前公司拥有。但是，目前福特公司一直在发布关于在这里建造新工厂的公告。

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：我们必须等待。然而，仅仅谈论关键矿产，并继续以我们仍然是“伐木工和挑水工”的方式对待世界，这种谬误在于。我们可以一直挖地洞，直到牛回家。但今天，这些地洞（锂和稀土）的唯一市场是中国，因为那里有转化和增值精炼能力。除非我们能拿出550亿美元中的一部分，说我们要建造或促进创建。

Perhaps copper is a bit more global uh the situation. But if we dug raris and lithium out of the ground, the only place we could ship it would be China because that's where the conversion and the value the value refining capacity.

### 加中关系中的风险与管理

史蒂夫·佩辛：有很长一串理由需要关注与中国增加接触的问题：恐吓侨民和散居社区。间谍活动，有充分记录的对本国的选举干预，中国对俄罗斯对抗乌克兰的战争机器的支持，对台湾的长期威胁，侵犯人权，迫害宗教少数群体，以及一些经不起推敲的劳工行为。维娜，这份清单，或者也许还有其他什么。如果我们与中国重新接触，加拿大面临的最大风险是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: There are a long list of reasons to be concerned about increased engagement with China, intimidation of expats and diaspora communities. Espionage, welldocumented election interference in this country, China's support of Russia's war machine against Ukraine, long-standing threat to Taiwan, human rights violations, persecution of religious minorities, some labor practices which do not stand up to light very well. Vina that list or maybe something else. What's the biggest risk to Canada if we re-engage with China?</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：嗯，好消息是，史蒂夫，我们一直在谈论要谨慎并考虑这些风险，包括经济风险，我认为我们一直在努力探讨我们想要拥有什么样的产业。所以，我们已经深入到对话的这一部分，即风险的种类以及我们如何管理这些风险，因为，再次，答案不是这种非黑即白的选择，即我们是否与中国接触。我认为这个小组的每个人都说，是的，我们必须在与中国的接触方面提升我们的水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Well, the good news, Steve, is that we have been speaking about being cautious and considering those risks, including economic risk, which I think we were trying to get at in terms of the kind of industries we want to have. So, we're we're deep into that part of the conversation is the kind of risks and how do we manage those risks because again, the answer is not this binary choice of do we engage with China or do we not. I think everybody on this panel says yes, we have to up our game in terms of engagement with China.</p>

</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：是的。所以，是的，我们确实需要更多地接触，在各个层面，包括商业、学术界、政府，与中国进行更多对话，更多了解中国，我们必须认识到存在许多许多需要管理的风险。所以我最近为《政策杂志》写了一篇文章，其中我列出了六个要素，这些要素必须到位，我们才能与中国进行更多合作，对吧？所以，它始于围绕我们想要保护的领域的护栏，无论是敏感技术还是研究，无论清单是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: yes. So yes, we do need to engage more and have more dialogue, more understanding of China at all levels, business, academia, government and we have to be cognizant that there are many many risks which need to be managed. So I did a piece for policy magazine recently where I sort of laid out kind of six elements that have to be in place for us to do more with China right so and it begins with guard rails around the areas which we want to protect so be that sensitive technologies be that research so whatever that list is</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：民主。

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: democracy</p>

维娜·纳吉布拉：当然，外国干预，我们的，是的，有很多清单，对吧？所以有护栏部分，然后我们需要明确我们想要做更多事情的领域，具体是哪些部门，我们必须具体化，对吧？就像不再仅仅是多卖或多买。我们必须更具体，对吧？然后我们必须拥有实际的工具来保护自己。所以所有我们还没有提到的事情，我们提到了围绕补贴或关键矿产战略等一些积极的事情，但我们还需要有筛选机制，投资筛选机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: sure foreign interference our yes there's a long list right so there's the guardrail piece then there is the area where we have to be clear on the stuff that we want to do more of what are the specific sectors we have to get granular right? Like it's no longer just about let's sell more or let's buy more. We have to get more specific, right? Then we have to have the actual tools to be able to to protect ourselves. So all of the things that we haven't yet mentioned, we've mentioned some of the kind of the positive things around subsidies or critical mineral strategy or whatever, but we also need to have screening mechanisms, investment screening mechanisms.</p>
</details>

史蒂夫·佩辛：我们现在有吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Do we have that yet?</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：嗯，所以我们有投资法案，但它需要更好地应用。现在它对部长来说非常自由裁量。不清楚。所以它使得系统不那么可预测。嗯，所以还有许多其他事情，然后我们必须建立联盟，因为我们单独永远无法对抗中国。所以我们仍然很难，因为美国过去常常领导所有这些，我们过去常常作为一个西方集团跟随。我们现在必须习惯一个美国不再领导的世界，对吧？所以我们必须展现领导力，并与其他欧洲、亚洲民主国家一起，共同找出如何管理风险。所以，再次，是的，存在许多许多风险，但答案仍然相同。我们必须继续与中国对话，与中国接触，我们必须在国内建立影响力，我们必须在国内建立能力。所以莱内特提到了公众的态度。它仍然对中国相当负面，但对中国、印度尼西亚、马来西亚以及所有这些其他国家的了解水平也非常低。对吧？所以我的意思是，我住在温哥华，在那里我们确实感觉自己是一个太平洋国家，但当你来到东部时，无论我们如何谈论自己是一个太平洋国家，它都是一个非常以欧洲为中心、以欧洲大西洋为中心的地方，为了能够接触，你必须了解对方，对吧？我们必须为此投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Uh so we we have investment act, but it needs to actually be better applied. Right now it's very discretionary to the minister. It's unclear. So it makes the system less predictable. Um so there are a number of other thing and then we have to build coalitions because alone we will never have leverage visav China. So we still it's very hard because US used to lead all of this and we used to kind of follow as a western block. We have to now be used to a world in which US does not lead right. So and we have to show leadership and with other European uh Asian democracies to be able to together figure out how to manage risks. So again yes there are many many risks but the answer remains the same. We have to continue to talk to China engage with China and we have to build leverage domestically and we have to build competence domestically. So Lynette mentioned about the attitude in the general public. It is still fairly negative towards China but there's also very low level of understanding of China of Indonesia of Malaysia of all these other countries. Right? So I mean I live in Vancouver where we do feel like a Pacific nation but when you come east as much as we talk about being a Pacific nation it's a very euroentric Euroatlantic kind of place and in order to be able to engage you have to know the other side right and we have to invest in that.</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：好的？我们需要保护国家利益。现在，我们还需要学习其他国家的成功经验。我看看澳大利亚人。谁是加拿大菜籽油无法进入中国的受益者？澳大利亚和巴西。我们对澳大利亚人管理他们国家或他们与中国企业的经营方式有问题吗？我的意思是，他们曾有贸易摩擦。他们是“五眼联盟”的成员。他们正在购买核潜艇。你猜这些潜艇将在哪里巡逻？不会是北极或太平洋。很可能是南海。但他们的贸易关系，他们与中国的贸易关系仍在继续增长。葡萄酒正在重新进入中国。铁矿石从未停止从澳大利亚进入中国。所以我认为我们需要看看其他国家在做什么，以及他们有多成功。而且每隔一段时间，当中国投资试图控制他们产业的敏感部分时，澳大利亚人就会说不。所以他们很清醒，他们非常警惕，我认为我们可以，我们或许可以比过去更谨慎地处理好这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Okay? We need to protect the national interest. Now, we also need to learn from successful examples from others. I I look at the Australians. Who was the beneficiary of Canadian canola oil not going to China? Australia and Brazil. Do we have a problem with the way the Australians run their uh their country or their businesses with the Chinese? I mean, they they had trade frictions. They're part of the five eyes. They're buying nuclear subs. And guess where those subs are going to be patrolling? They're not. It's not going to be the Arctic or the Pacific. It's probably the South China Sea. But and yet their trading relation their trade relation with China continues to increase. Wine is going back into China. Uh ironor has never stopped going into China from Australia. So I think we need to look at what others are doing and how successful they are. And every once in a while the Australians when Chinese investment is trying to control sensitive parts of their industry, they say no. So they they're cognizant and they're very vigilant and I think you can do we can probably um thread the needle perhaps a bit more carefully than we have done so in the past.</p>

### “可变几何”外交策略的实践

史蒂夫·佩辛：让我给在座的观众一个提示。你们看到麦克风放在房间中央。所以我要在这里再问一个问题，然后我们就要开始接受大家的提问了。所以让我抛出马克·卡尼在11月《经济学人》文章中使用的“可变几何”这个词，作为与中国接触的一种可行方法。玛丽，您如何解读这个词的含义，我们应该这样做吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Let me give a heads up to this audience. You see the microphone placed in the middle of the room. So I'm going to ask one more question here and then we're going to start to take questions from you folks. So let me throw this phrase that Mark Carney used in his November piece in the Economist variable geometry. as a plausible approach to engaging China. Mary, what what do you interpret that to mean and should we do it?</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：我想我们之前已经稍微谈过这个问题了。导致多边合作的**可变几何**（Variable Geometry: 一种根据共同利益而非共同价值观建立伙伴关系的外交策略）。多边合作仅仅是与那些你可以建立共同点、共同利益的伙伴建立不同的伙伴关系。所以摆脱价值观，而是基于你拥有的共同利益，并以一种实际上能帮助你获得所需影响力和杠杆的方式共同行动，超越你自己。所以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: I think we uh talked about that a little bit earlier. The variable geometry that leads to pluralateralism. Pluralateralism is just simply creating different partnerships with others who who you could create some um uh common ground with um a set of interests. So getting away from values but from interest that you have shared interests with and to do that together in a way that uh in a way that actually will help you have the kind of leverage and the influence that you will need beyond yourself. So that</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：我们准备好这样做吗？

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: are we well poised to do it?</p>
</details>

玛丽·吴：我认为我们绝对准备好了。我认为我们作为一个中等国家。我认为有很多工作要做。但我们加拿大准备好了吗？是的。我们知道如何做。我们在世界各地都有可以合作的伙伴，而且我们需要着手去做。你谈到的那个清单，不仅仅是加拿大有那个清单。许多其他国家也有。所以，你会有其他中等强国。你会有其他人在那个可变几何的设定中，你可以与他们合作，以确定那些能够让我们与中国进行接触和对话的利益，而不仅仅是加拿大。这是一个由国家和盟友组成的整体群体，这些利益或许就是那些利益，你实际上进行了这些对话，你进行了这种接触。这不是对话。你进行了一种可以让你进入更具意义的关系的接触。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: I think we absolutely are. I think we are as a middle country. I think that there's a lot of work that has to be done to do that. But do are we poised as Canada? Yes. We we know how to do this. We have partners around the world that we could do it with and uh and and we need to get on and do it. That list that you talked about, it's not just Canada that has that that that has that list. It's many other countries. So, you're going to have other middle powers. you're going to have other people in that variable geometry set that you can work with to identify interests that uh that allow us to then engage and have those conversations with China where it's more than just Canada. It's an entire group of you know of of of countries of allies where those very interests perhaps those are the interests and you actually have those conversations um you have that engagement. It's not conversation. You have an engagement that could try to get you into uh a more meaningful.</p>
</details>

莱内特：所以当马克·卡尼谈到可变几何时，我脑海中浮现的是一个由多个同心圆组成的**维恩图**（Venn Diagram: 一种用圆形表示集合及其关系的图示），它们相互重叠。对吧？一个可以代表任意拘留。另一个可以代表关键矿产供应的垄断。我们可以有多个圆圈来应对中国的问题，比如选举干预、贸易胁迫等等，这些我们还没有做。我认为关于护栏，我们应该在与中国的关系中预先设置的预防性护栏，无论是接触还是更深层次的关系，这些都是我认为我们应该在问题实际出现之前预先思考的同心圆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lynette: So when Mark Honey talks about variable of geometry, what appears in my mind is a van diagram with multiple concentric circle that overlap with each other. Right? One could represent arbitrary detention. The other one could represent monopoly of critical mineral supply. And we could have a multiple circles to cope with the re the is the issue of China such as electoral interference, trade coercion, uh so on and so forth which we haven't done and I think the thing about guardrail preemptive guardrail that we should put in place as we proceed with our relationship with China be it engagement or or deeper relationship these are the concentric circles that I think we should be thinking about pre preempt ly before problems actually emerge.</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：是的。所以我想这是玛丽和我观点略有不同的地方。能做到吗？是的。我们目前准备好这样做吗？我不确定，因为正如莱内特所说，我们一直对中国的行为反应过度，对吧？而不是主动地对我们想从中国得到什么以及我们不想做什么有一个非常清晰的理解。我认为我们还必须认识到，中国不仅仅是任何其他参与者。所以康斯坦丁总是说，每个人都这样做。嗯，中国是**中国共产党**（Chinese Communist Party: 中华人民共和国的执政党）。它比任何其他国家都强大得多。它现在是与美国平等的国家。所以它不仅仅是另一个我们需要管理关系的中等强国。我们必须认识到他们的经济规模是我们的40倍。他们已经在这种本质上制造不对称依赖的游戏中玩了15到20年。在产业战略方面，他们在许多方面都领先于我们。所以我们必须现实地看待我们正在与谁打交道，以及我们没有做好功课的事实。我们一直很自满。所以，是的，我们能否与中国进行选择性接触？是的。我们现在有工具吗？没有。如果我们真正用心去做，我们能否开发它们？是的。但我们必须进行你在这个房间里发起的这种对话，才能做到这一点。因为在民主国家，不仅仅是我们的政治领导人，人民也需要参与。这就是我们在这里的原因。我认为我们已经在做一些事情了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Yeah. So I think this is the one place where uh Mary and I have a slightly different view. Can it be done? Yes. Are we currently ready to do that? I I'm not sure because as as Lynette is saying, we have been so reactive to what China does, right? Rather than proactively have a really clear understanding of what it is that we want from China and what it is that we are not going to do. And I think we have to also recognize that China is not just any other actor. So Constantine constantly says with everybody does that. Well, China is m CCP is communist Chinese party. It's it's much much more powerful than any other country. It's now a peer state to the US. So it's not just another middle power that we have to kind of manage relations with. We have to recognize their economies 40 times the size of ours. There have been at this game of essentially creating asymmetric dependencies for 15 20 years. They're ahead of us on so many things when it comes to industrial strategy. So we have to be realistic of who we are dealing with and the fact that we haven't done our homework. We have been complacent. And so yes, can we have selective engagement with China? Yes. Do we have the tools right now? No. Can we develop them if we actually put our minds to it? Yes. But we have to have the kind of conversations that you're initiating in this room to be able to do that. Because in a democracy, it's not just our political leaders, but people who also need to participate. why we're here. I think we're already doing some of that.</p>

### 观众提问与专家回应

JM：哦，是的。嗯，我叫JM。我是多伦多大学的国际学生。我喜欢谈论加拿大的民主。我的感觉是，嗯，与华人相关的种族等级制度有些问题，因为当我们回顾华人在加拿大的历史记录时，有不列颠哥伦比亚省的建筑工人，有“黄祸论”，有华人人头税，亚洲少数民族以及疫情期间的仇恨。所以如果加拿大对这个国家的华裔加拿大人来说是一个相当独裁的国家，那么加拿大政府有什么资格称中国政府是独裁的呢？因为华人的自由在这两个国家几乎是相同的，独裁也几乎是相同的。

And you're right, um, for me, it was not lost on me that on July the 1st, a couple of years ago, opening up the Chinese Canadian Museum in Vancouver to acknowledge an exclusion act where someone like me, a sitting member of Parliament, was complicit in creating a law that prohibited people like me from coming in the country. But it's about recognizing and acknowledging um those you know the faults of our past as we have with indigenous reconciliation and and and and the answer is absolutely there's there's a lot that we're not a proud that we're not proud of but what have we done about Bob Ray says Bob Ray says what will we continue to do and look what we are</p>

卡罗琳：哦，嗨，我叫卡罗琳，我是财务秘书。我很高兴这里提到了中国问题，而且信息非常丰富。作为一名华裔加拿大人，中国对我来说非常亲切，但同时，我来到加拿大是为了自由。当马克·卡尼重新开启与中国的对话时，我非常担心，你知道，加拿大的价值观是否会受到损害，因为中国利用投资和贸易来影响加拿大的商业和公众舆论，策划跨国镇压，以及国家支持的网络攻击。所以，我想听听这位先生的回答，关于加拿大如何在与中国进行贸易的同时，不损害加拿大的价值观。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">Caroline: oh hi my name is Caroline I'm in finance secretary. I'm very happy uh the issue about China was brought up here and that's very informed. Uh as a Chinese Canadian uh China is very dear to me but in the meantime I came to Canada for freedom. When Mark Carney reopened the dialogue with China, I'm very concerned about, you know, if Canadian values will be compromised because China leverage the investment and trade to influence Canadian uh business and public opinion orchestra transnational repression uh and a state sponsor cyber attack. Uh so uh I I'd like to hear the answer from the gentleman about how we can uh Canada balance the relation between doing trade with China in the meantime uh not compro compromise Canadian values. Thank you</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：谢谢。我看不出加拿大的价值观会因为与他人进行更多业务而受到损害，无论是中国、印度还是美国。所以我认为加拿大的价值观没有那么脆弱，不会因为我们多卖或少卖而受到损害。我认为这是我们国家的一个特征，幸运的是我们对此感到满意，我们继续解决不满，我们继续修复问题。我们当然可以做得更好。你提出了法律问题。所以如果存在胁迫，如果这个国家存在非法活动，我们有法律和手段来制止它。我们需要更加努力。毫无疑问。有间谍。

<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: Thanks. I fail to see how Canadian values could be compromised by doing more business with others whether it's China, whether it's India. uh whether it's the United States. So I don't think Canadian values are that weak to be compromised because we sell more or we sell less. I think this is a characteristic of our country and mercifully we're we're fine with it and we continue to settle grievances and we continue to fix problems. We could be doing a better job. Of course you you're raising issues that are issues of law. So if there is coercion, if there is uh illegal activity in this country, we have the laws and the means to put an end to it. We need to try harder. There's no question about it. There's spies.</p>

史蒂夫·佩辛：让我给维娜一个机会来回答这个问题。您认为如果我们与这些国家进行更多业务，会威胁到我们的价值观吗？

<p class="english-text">Steve Paikin: Let me give let me give Vina a chance to speak to this question, too. Do you think if we do more business with these countries, it threatens our values?</p>
</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：嗯，它可能使我们容易受到胁迫，并被迫遵守与我们价值观不符的论点。所以我认为它使我们面临这种风险，但我们必须管理这种风险。换句话说，当康斯坦丁说他无法想象那个世界时，我的意思是，我们有例子可以说明那是什么样子，对吧？因为如果中国基本上说，为了进入这个市场，你必须停止批评人权状况，或者你必须停止谈论外国干预，所有这些事情，如果我们遵守，那将是损害我们的价值观。现在，如果我们给他们施加影响力，它会使我们更容易受到攻击，但它不一定会以这种方式结束。所以我们有办法同时管理两者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: Well, it can make us vulnerable to coercion and to compliance with lines of argument that are not in our consistent with our values. So I think it opens us to that risk but we have to manage that. So in other words when Constantine says he can't imagine that world I mean we have examples of what that looks like right so because if basically China says in order to have access to this market you have to stop criticizing situations of human rights or you have to stop talking about foreign interference all of those things if we were to comply that would be compromising our values. Now it opens it makes us more vulnerable if we give them leverage but it doesn't have to end up there. So there's a way for us to manage both</p>

</details>

维娜·纳吉布拉：克雷蒂安当时面对的是一个非常不同的中国。所以我认为我们不能将90年代和2000年代初发生的事情与现在发生的事情进行比较。我的观点是，中国现在强大得多，并要求像加拿大这样的小国更多地遵守。

莱内特：我们将从这里开始。我认为任何国家都不应该站在道德制高点上说我们只做公平贸易，因为这些事情非常非常模糊。界限非常模糊。对。你给出的例子，你知道，你必须真正分解一件衬衫、一件女衬衫的成分，才能说这些成分实际上是从哪里来的，这非常非常困难，但关于脆弱性问题，正如你所提到的，我们之前讨论过，我认为加拿大，从定义上讲，因为华裔散居人口的规模，我也是其中一员，我也是华裔加拿大人，无论我们是否与中国贸易，都容易受到中国政治干预。我的意思是，这是两个独立的问题。我们为什么要夸大它们？我们为什么要混淆它们？对吧？如果我们不与中国贸易，还有一个我们没有问过的问题。我们的经济繁荣怎么办？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lynette: We'll start with the I don't think any country should stand on moral high ground and say that we only do fair trade because these things are very very murky.

Right. the the examples that you have given you know like you have to really have to break down the ingredients of a shirt of a blouse to see to say that where these ingredients are actually source sourced from it is very very difficult but on the questions of vulnerability as as you have mentioned and we discussed earlier I think Canada by definition because of the size of the Chinese diaspora which I'm one of them I'm also a Chinese Canadian is vulnerable to Chinese political interference whether or not we trade with China. I mean these are two separate questions. Why are we inflating them? Why are we conflating them? Right? And if we do not trade with China, there's another question that we have not asked. How about our economic prosperity?</p>

维娜·纳吉布拉：没有人说我们不应该与中国贸易，再次，这取决于什么样的贸易，这不仅仅是贸易，还包括投资，还包括更深层次的经济关系。现在的贸易不仅仅是贸易，它与国家安全和经济安全息息相关，莱内特说得对，鉴于加拿大社会的构成，我们对外国干预和散居人口的脆弱性是固有的。但如果我们某些部门对中国产生战略依赖，我们也有其他潜在的脆弱性。所以你仍然可能变得更脆弱。仅仅因为某种程度的脆弱性是固有的，并不意味着，哦，那么在这种情况下我们做什么都无所谓。所以我认为，再次，多重事实可以同时存在。是的，我们必须与中国进行一些贸易。中国是一个重要且有影响力的经济大国。我们不能忽视，我们必须清醒地认识到，鉴于贸易现在与国家安全和经济安全内在联系，更大程度的接触会带来什么样的战略依赖和风险。我们不再生活在一个政治、贸易、外交是独立领域的世界上。

<p class="english-text">Vina Najibulla: nobody's saying that we shouldn't trade with China again it depends on what kind of trade and it's not just about trade it's also about investment it's about deeper economic relations trade right now is not just about trade there are links to national security and economic security and Lynette is right that our vulnerability v foreign interference and diaspora is of course baked in given the composition of Canadian society But we also have other potential vulnerabilities if we become strategically dependent on China in certain sectors. So you can still become more vulnerable. Just because a certain level of vulnerability is baked in doesn't mean that oh well then in that case it doesn't matter what else we do. So I think again multiple things can be true at the same time. Yes, we have to do some trade with China. China is an important consequential economic power. We cannot ignore and we have to be cleareyed about the kind of strategic dependencies, the kind of risks that come with greater engagement given that trade now is intrinsically linked to national security and economic security.

I think we're all in this boat together and I think I go back to what is it that we need to do as Canada as a country? What is in our interest? What kind of economy do we want uh down the road? What stands in the way of our economy getting there? Who should we be partnering with? How do we deepen those relationships in such a way that actually is inherently good for Canadian resiliency, for our economy in the future, for jobs for our workers, for us to be able to innovate, for us to compete, uh, and with whom? I mean, so I think that th those are the questions that that we as Canadians should be very cleareyed and very very focused on and getting ourselves on a path of accomplishing that over the next, you know, over the next number of years and decades so that Canada continues to have the standard of living that we want that continues to attract the people that we do that has the freedoms and the democra and and and and and living within, you know, within the democratic system that we have enjoyed.</p>

埃利奥特·陈：嗯，我的问题是关于贸易平衡的。嗯，正如你们所知，中国在过去十年里投入了数千亿美元，试图实现自给自足，特别是在高科技领域，你知道，从半导体到电动汽车，甚至食品。嗯，你知道，世界上存在这样一种情况，中国希望在所有这些方面实现自给自足，而不依赖从世界其他地方进口。所以我想我的问题是，对于小组中那些更支持转向中国的成员，也许是库里奥诺普洛斯先生。嗯，你知道，当一个国家想出售，你知道，从**Temu**（Temu: 一家中国在线零售商）商品到芯片再到电动汽车的一切，而另一个国家主要提供菜籽油和鱼时，你如何建立可持续的贸易关系？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Elliot Chen: Um my question is about the trade balance. Um as as as you know, you know, China spent the last decade spending hundreds of billions of dollars trying to achieve self-sufficiency. uh particularly in high-tech sectors, you know, everything from semiconductors to EVs to even food. Um you know, there there's a world in which China would like to be self-sufficient in all these things and not be dependent on importing from the rest of the world. And so I guess my question is for the you know the members of the panel that are more supportive of of a pivot uh perhaps Mr. to carryonopoulos. Um, you know, how do you build a sustainable trading relationship when one country wants to sell, you know, everything from timu goods to chips to EVs and the other country is primarily offering canola and fish.</p>
</details>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：嗯，是的，这不会容易，但我们之前稍微谈过，我们提到了产业战略。我认为北美和欧洲在战后时期之所以能以这种方式发展，其中一个重要原因就是产业战略的存在，嗯，在加拿大，至少在过去的几十年里，围绕汽车工业。好吧，也许在加拿大没有那么多，但在安大略省和魁北克省。我认为我们需要重新思考我们作为一个国家需要做什么，以及我们未来5年、10年、20年需要处于什么位置。

<p class="english-text">Constantine Curionopoulos: Um, yeah, it's not going to be easy, but we we talked a little bit earlier about um we mentioned rather an industrial strategy. Um I think part of one of the many reasons why North America and Europe developed the way they did in the postc world war period is the existence of industrial strategies um in in Canada at least in the last uh few decades around the automotive industry. Well perhaps not so much in Canada but in Ontario and Quebec. Um I think we need to rethink of what we need to do as a country and where we need to be in 5 10 20 years.</p>

康斯坦丁·库里奥诺普洛斯：而且，你知道，我不仅仅是因为中国这样做才这么说，而是我有点亲身经历。我的意思是，2011年，中国在“十二五”规划中确定了八个战略性新兴产业，其中大部分围绕脱碳和能源转型，他们绝对决心主导这些产业，利用它们来推动，是的，利用它们来推动他们的工业扩张，同时，也许在“十三五”规划中，他们确定需要实现关键矿产的自给自足，他们着手在全球范围内拥有关键矿产资产。我们需要思考我们需要做什么。当我们之前谈论从地下开采关键矿产时，我认为我们需要考虑在这里增加价值，以便为我们慷慨资助的电动汽车产业提供原料。

We need to think about what we need to do. When we were talking earlier about digging critical minerals out of the ground, I think we need to be thinking of adding value here in order to feed the EV industry that we've been so generously funding</p>

扎克：我是滑铁卢大学的扎克，我的问题是问部长，我们是否认为转向中国是免费的，因为美国很容易报复，而且考虑到比较，即使墨西哥也在报复中国，并对他们征收关税以取悦美国。所以我们认为，考虑到巨大的差距，尝试转向值得吗？

<p class="english-text">Zach: Zach from University of Wateroo and my question is to the minister is do we think a pivot to China would be costfree because the US could easily retaliate and given the comparison even Mexico is retaliating on China and putting tariffs on them to please the US. So do we think it's worth the juice to try to pivot given the huge gaps?</p>

<p class="english-text">Mary Ng: I don't think it's a pivot. I think it is what we all said what the variety of us said that we need to that we shouldn't ignore the second largest economy in the world and that there are interests for Canada to uh to expand and to do more in. So I think about tourism, I think about agra foods, I think about uh you know I right I mean energy right I mean like so I so there are this is where we do that and uh and I think we also then think about who else we do more trade with I mean around the world who are our partners or who should be better you know who should be deeper partners so I don't think I don't think it's a straight pivot I think it's I think you can walk and chew gum at the same time</p>
