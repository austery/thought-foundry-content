### 2025年科技就业市场概览

我将详细解析2025年科技就业市场的所有关键信息，包括劳动力市场的变化、技能要求、人工智能（AI）的影响以及人才招聘策略的调整。企业正积极推动员工返岗，AI已主导绩效评估，年轻一代不愿担任管理职位，“假装成功直到你真的成功”（fake it till you make it）的心态也终于开始消退。如果你还在使用ChatGPT撰写简历，那么你必须听听这些，希望我能说服你重新思考。我们将从招聘乐观情绪和劳动力市场韧性开始。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm about to break down everything you need to know about the tech job market in 2025, including changes in the labor market, skill requirements, AI influence, and changes in talent acquisition strategies. Companies are racing to the office, AI has taken over performance reviews, the younger generation is not willing to step into managerial roles, and the 'fake it till you make it' mentality is finally on the decline. If you're still writing your resume with ChatGPT, you need to listen to this; hopefully, I can convince you to rethink it. We're going to start with hiring optimism and labor market resilience.</p>
</details>

### 招聘乐观情绪与劳动力市场韧性

根据现有信息，2025年我们将从过去三年强劲的雇主市场转向一个更加平衡的劳动力市场。有几个因素促成了这一转变：根据**ZipRecruiter**（美国在线招聘网站）的一项调查，76%的雇主计划在2025年增加员工人数。预计在2025年至2030年间，就业市场将实现总就业人数7%的净增长，即780万个工作岗位。许多行业的职位发布量仍保持在疫情前水平，表明对工人的需求持续存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Based on the available information, in 2025, we will be shifting towards a more balanced labor market, rather than continuing to be in a strong employers' market as in the past three years. Several factors contribute to this: 76% of employers plan to expand their headcount in 2025, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. The job market is expected to see a net growth of 7% in total employment, or 7.8 million jobs, between 2025 and 2030. Job postings remain at pre-pandemic levels in many sectors, indicating sustained demand for workers.</p>
</details>

然而，尽管有降温趋势，劳动力市场仍显示出持续的韧性和雇主的乐观情绪。市场依然非常饱和；政治不确定性很高，尤其是在北美地区，如果我们考虑到可能发生或不发生的关税战，许多人仍在坚守自己的工作岗位，以应对可能随之而来的经济变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, despite the cooling trends, there are signs of continued labor market strength and employer optimism. The market is still very saturated; there is a lot of political uncertainty, especially in North America, and if we take into consideration the tariff wars that may or may not happen, many people are still holding on to their jobs in anticipation of upcoming economic changes that may or may not follow as a consequence of potential tariff wars.</p>
</details>

我必须强调，你所有与职业相关的行动都必须通过当前市场状况的视角来审视。如果你觉得自己落后了，看到朋友在大科技公司（**Big Tech**：通常指市值高、影响力大的科技巨头，如Google、Apple等）工作，务必问清楚他们是什么时候以及如何获得这份工作的。如果你正努力进入**FAANG**（FANG：最初指Facebook、Amazon、Apple、Netflix、Google五大科技巨头，现泛指大型科技公司）但屡屡碰壁，那么你不应该去咨询那些在2018年甚至2020年获得工作的人。那完全是另一个世界。你朋友进入大科技公司时的就业市场条件与我们今天所处的环境截然不同。如果你的朋友在进入FAANG之前就有大公司（指在知名大公司的工作经验）的背景，那又是一个与你目前面临的情况截然不同的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I cannot emphasize this enough: everything you're doing career-wise has to be viewed through the lens of current market conditions. If you're feeling like you're behind and you're looking at a friend who has a job at Big Tech (大型科技公司：通常指市值高、影响力大的科技巨头, 如Google、Apple等), always ask when and how they got that job. If you are trying to break into FAANG (FANG: 最初指Facebook、Amazon、Apple、Netflix、Google五大科技巨头，现泛指大型科技公司) and nothing's working for you, you should not be talking to somebody who got that job in 2018 or even in 2020. That is an entirely different universe. The conditions of the job market that were present when your friend entered Big Tech were polar opposite to where we are today. If your friend had big logos (指在知名大公司的工作经验) before they got into FAANG, again, that is a very different situation from what you're facing right now.</p>
</details>

### 日益增长的技能短缺与应对策略

第二点：日益增长的技能短缺。长期以来，技能短缺一直是雇主和招聘团队面临的一个重大问题。然而，技术进步的快速步伐使情况变得更糟，导致企业争相寻找具备合适技能的员工。我们正逐渐摆脱“通才时代”。2025年，克服技能短缺将需要企业采取多方面的方法。企业将继续扩大其人才库，利用被动求职者、应届毕业生和远程员工。同时，企业也将采取综合措施，投资于员工的持续培训和技能发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two: growing skill shortages. Skill shortages have been a significant problem for employers and recruitment teams for a while. However, the rapid pace of technological progress has made matters worse, leaving businesses scrambling to find workers with the right skills. We are slowly moving away from the era of generalists. Overcoming skill shortages in 2025 will require a multifaceted approach from the business side. Businesses will continue expanding their talent pools, tapping into passive candidates, recent graduates, and remote employees. At the same time, businesses will take a comprehensive approach to investing in continuous training and skill development of their employees.</p>
</details>

现在，请听取你雇主的建议：如果他们提供这些机会，我看到周围有很多人没有利用公司提供给他们的资源。公司为你的技能发展拨付了预算，如果公司没有强制你去做，你应该主动争取，因为那是免费的资源。在做出下一步职业选择时，你也应该考虑公司投资你教育的意愿，尤其是在你职业生涯早期。这里有一个我个人经历的例子：我曾在一家公司工作，在我接受他们的录用时，他们承诺会投资我的教育和技能发展。这些承诺非常笼统，没有书面记录，只是口头承诺。但当我加入公司后，发现每个团队都分配到了特定的预算，这个预算再按团队成员数量进行分配。所以，如果你的团队获得了1000美元，而团队有10名员工，那么你们每个人只能得到100美元。而100美元对于高质量的教育来说微不足道。我当时每年获得了500美元的预算，结果甚至不够在**Reforge**（在线职业教育平台）上学习一门课程。因此，如果技能发展对你很重要，请确保将其写入你的合同中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, take this from your employer: if they're offering that, I see so many people around me who are not taking advantage of what their companies are offering them. There are budgets allocated for your skill development, and if the company's not forcing you to do it, you should be proactive about it because that's free money. You should also consider the company's willingness to invest in your education when making your next move, especially if you're early in your career. Here's an example from my own experience: I worked at a company that promised they would make investments into my education and skill development when I was accepting their offer. The promises were very generic; they were not documented; they were just verbal promises. But when I joined the company, it turned out that every team got allocated a certain budget, and that budget was split between the number of members on every team. So, if your team got $1,000 and you had 10 employees on the team, every single one of you would get only $100. And $100 is nothing for a good quality education. I got offered $500 a year, which in the end was not enough even for one course at Reforge (在线职业教育平台). So, if skill development is something that matters to you, make sure that it's stipulated in your contract.</p>
</details>

### 科技领域中个体贡献者的崛起

第三点：科技领域中**个体贡献者**（individual contributors：指在组织中通过个人专业技能和产出直接贡献价值，而非通过管理团队实现目标的员工）的崛起。这是最有趣的趋势，也是我个人非常兴奋的一点，因为我不再觉得自己像个骗子。在我谈论它之前，我想先举一个我个人经历的简短例子。我从未想过要成为一名经理，我也没有这种抱负，我从未将人员经理视为我有一天渴望成为的人。那是因为我认为人员经理这个职位应该授予那些真正通过努力赢得它的人，而不是那些仅仅在公司熬了足够长时间，直到所有人都离开，而你成为唯一候选人的人。相反，它应该授予那些通过其智慧、可量化的成果以及高情商真正赢得它的人，这些特质赋予他们领导他人的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number three: rise of individual contributors (个体贡献者：指在组织中通过个人专业技能和产出直接贡献价值，而非通过管理团队实现目标的员工) in tech. This is the most interesting trend, and the one I'm incredibly excited about because I no longer feel like a fraud. Before I talk about it, I want to give a very quick example from a personal experience. I never wanted to become a manager; I never had this ambition, and I never looked at people managers as someone I aspired to be one day. That is because the way I thought about being a people manager is that I think it should be given to people who truly earned it, not those who just waited long enough at the company until everybody else left and they were the only candidate for the job. Instead, it should be given to those who actually earned it with their intelligent, quantifiable outcomes and a very high level of emotional intelligence that would give them the ability to lead other people.</p>
</details>

对我来说，这份工作伴随着无数的责任和巨大的压力，我个人宁愿将时间投入到我的技能和作为产品管理专业人士的个人发展上，而不是去指导他人。我一直认为，一个成为经理的人必须具备超强的技能，他们必须已经非常擅长自己的工作，并且非常擅长领导他人。然而，历史上直到最近，包括科技行业在内的大多数公司职位晋升标准都是：初级、中级、高级、经理。人们普遍认为，一旦你在高级个体贡献者（individual contributor）的岗位上表现足够出色，你最终就会成为一名经理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To me, this job comes with numerous responsibilities and a very high level of stress, and I personally would rather spend that time investing in my skills and my own personal development as a product management professional rather than coaching others. I always thought that a person becoming a manager has to be incredibly skilled; they have to be very good at what they do already, and they have to be very good at leading other people. However, historically and up until very recently, the standard progression in most corporate roles, including tech, was Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Manager. It was kind of expected that you would eventually become a manager once you were doing well enough in your senior role as an individual contributor.</p>
</details>

甚至在我年轻时刚开始职业生涯时，我一直在思考当我超越高级职位后该怎么办，因为我从不想成为一名经理。我的目标始终是在我所做的事情上获得极强的能力。我不认同那种策略，即你记录下你一天中做的每一件事，然后为你的管理团队编造一个夸张的故事，然后你开始为了这些表面功夫而工作，最终通过这种方式进入管理岗位，通过不具备极强能力，而是通过知道该和谁说话、该在谁面前露脸来攀登公司阶梯。因为我认为，即使你通过非常策略性和精于算计的行动来建立职业生涯，最终你的技能不足也会暴露出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even when I was younger, just starting my career, I kept thinking what I would do when I passed the senior level because I never wanted to be a manager. My goal has always been to gain very intense competence in what I do. I do not abide by tactics where you document every single thing you do during the day, then create a larger-than-life story for your management team, and then start working for those optics. That's how you make your way into the managerial role, climbing that corporate ladder by not being intensely competent but by knowing who to talk to and who to show your face to. Because I think that even if you manage to build a career by being very tactical and very calculated about your moves and things that you do, eventually your lack of skill will show.</p>
</details>

没有什么比“假装成功直到你真的成功”（fake it till you make it）这句话更让我讨厌的了。我认为我们作为一个社会在全球层面面临许多问题，因为有很多人非常擅长“假装”。我对顾问的角色也有同样的看法，比如在**德勤**（Deloitte：全球四大会计师事务所之一）或**麦肯锡**（McKinsey：全球知名管理咨询公司）的商业顾问。我曾认为你必须具备超强的能力才能在那里获得一个职位。我认为成为一名顾问——“顾问”这个词本身就意味着你在就如何开展业务向某人提供咨询，而且很可能是在20或25年取得成功后，你才会被一家咨询公司邀请去做这项工作。然后会有一个客户愿意为你的经验、知识和思维方式支付高昂的费用，让你现在可以就如何发展或转型一家大型企业提供咨询。是的，直到我有机会与那些在顶级咨询公司工作的咨询界人士相处更多时间，我对这份工作的看法才彻底颠覆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is nothing I hate more than this freaking expression: 'fake it till you make it.' I think that we as a society have a lot of problems on a global level because there are a lot of people that are very good at faking it. I had the same perception of the role of a consultant, like a business consultant at Deloitte (德勤：全球四大会计师事务所之一) or McKinsey (麦肯锡：全球知名管理咨询公司). I thought you had to be insanely competent to land a role there. I thought that being a consultant—well, the word 'consultant' implies that you are consulting somebody on how to do business, and probably after 20 or 25 years of proven success, you are invited by a consulting company to do that work. Then there is a customer who is willing to pay a lot of money for your experience and knowledge and your way of thinking that you're now allowed to consult a massive business on how to grow or how to transform. Yeah, that was until I had a chance to spend more time with people from the consulting world working at those top five consulting firms, and my perception of this job just shattered.</p>
</details>

所以，回到正题，我对个体贡献者职业路径的兴起感到非常兴奋。像我这样的首席产品经理（Principal PM）职位，或者任何其他职位：首席级别、员工级别、团队级别总监、高级总监、没有直接下属的副总裁（VPs）。他们的薪资将与有下属的同事一样高，只不过他们的重点将放在其特定领域的专业能力和经验上，而不是人员管理。这目前仍然非常罕见，但在未来5年内，我们将看到个体贡献者职位的崛起，我为那些包括我自己，希望在特定领域建立专业能力而不是专注于人员管理技能的人感到非常兴奋，因为这给了我对未来很大的希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So anyway, back to the topic, I am so excited about the rise of career paths for individual contributors. Roles such as Principal PM (Principal Product Manager) in my case, but it could be any other job: principal level, staff level, group level directors, senior directors, VPs without direct reports. They're going to be making just as much as their counterparts who have reports, except their focus will be on the competency and the experience in their specific field rather than people management. This is still very rare, but we are going to be seeing the rise of individual contributor roles in the next 5 years, and I'm very excited for people, including myself, who want to build competence in their specific field rather than working on people management skills, because this gives me a lot of hope for the future.</p>
</details>

公司开始为个体贡献者创建专门的职业路径，允许他们在不一定转向管理岗位的情况下，凭借其技术专长获得晋升和奖励。这一趋势认可了深厚专业知识的价值（还记得我们之前谈到的技能短缺吗？），并鼓励留住顶尖人才。我们将开始看到联合总监（co-director）职位的出现，其中一位总监专注于人员管理职责，如绩效评估、休假讨论、薪酬等等，而另一位总监则在你所擅长的领域内为你提供指导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Companies are starting to create dedicated career paths for individual contributors, allowing them to progress and to be rewarded for their technical expertise without necessarily moving into management. This trend recognizes the value of deep subject expertise (remember the skill shortages we talked about earlier) and encourages the retention of top talent. We're going to start seeing the creation of co-director roles where one director focuses on people management responsibilities, such as performance reviews, vacation discussion, compensation, and so on, and the other director guides you within the area that you specialize in.</p>
</details>

### AI与机器人对绩效管理和招聘的影响

现在，我们来谈谈人工智能（AI）和机器人与人力的关系。雇主们正在接受这样的理念：AI工具可以提高工作场所的公平性，并突出那些在传统绩效管理中可能被人员经理忽视的贡献。经理们仍将作为“人在回路”（human in the loop）的最终决策者，验证和核实机器人的建议。但对于更日常的活动，例如即时绩效评估，机器人很可能承担越来越多的经理任务，特别是对于基于数字的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, let's talk about AI and bots versus people. Employers are embracing the idea that AI tools can increase fairness in their workplace and highlight contributions that people managers could miss in more traditional performance management. Managers will still finalize the decisions as the human in the loop, validating and verifying the bot's recommendations. But for more everyday activities, such as in-the-moment performance reviews, bots are likely to take on an increasing share of manager tasks, especially for work that is digitally based.</p>
</details>

我预计，未来我们将看到AI在排班、反馈、绩效评估以及晋升和招聘决策中得到更广泛的应用。**高德纳**（Gartner：全球领先的信息技术研究和顾问公司）2024年6月对3300多名员工进行的一项调查显示，57%的员工认为在做出薪酬决定时，人类比AI更具偏见。高德纳2024年10月对近3500名员工进行的另一项调查表明，87%的员工认为算法可以提供比他们经理目前更公平的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I expect that going forward, we will be seeing increased use of AI in scheduling, feedback, performance reviews, and promotion and hiring decisions. A June 2024 Gartner (高德纳：全球领先的信息技术研究和顾问公司) survey of more than 3,300 employees revealed that 57% believe that humans are way more biased than AI when it comes to making compensation decisions. An October 2024 Gartner survey of nearly 3,500 employees suggested that 87% of employees think that algorithms could give fairer feedback than their managers right now.</p>
</details>

那么，这对你意味着什么呢？如果你的工作中有这样的系统，经理要求你每周五填写周总结——你做了什么、取得了什么成就等等——请认真且勤奋地去做，因为这些数据点将被输入到AI代理中，它们将每周处理你的反馈。这正是帮助你在下一次绩效评估以及奖金和薪酬谈判中取得好结果的关键。不要忽视这些事情。我知道很多人都说过，你应该全年记录你的所有成就，以便在年底正确填写文档，但你应该更频繁地这样做，因为很多数据将不再由你的直属经理处理，而是由他们将投入使用的AI工具处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what does this mean for you? If you have those systems at work where your manager asks you to fill out your weekly summary every Friday—what you've done, what you've achieved, things like that—do it and be very diligent about it, because those data points are going to be fed to AI agents that will be processing your feedback every single week. And that is exactly what's going to be helping you in your next performance review and conversation about your bonus and compensation. Do not neglect those things. I know this has been said many times: that you should be documenting all of your achievements throughout the year so you can properly fill out documentation at the end of it. But you should be doing it a lot more, because a lot of that data will be processed not by your direct manager but by the AI tools that they're going to be putting to use.</p>
</details>

### 人才招聘策略的转变

这引出了我的下一个观点：未来**人才招聘**（talent acquisition：指企业寻找、吸引、评估和聘用合格人才的过程）策略将发生哪些变化？AI将被大量用于筛选哪些简历能够进入面试环节。我希望我不需要向任何人解释AI可以检测AI。请不要盲目地使用**ChatGPT**（OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）或**Claude**（Anthropic开发的大型语言模型）来撰写简历，仅仅进行复制粘贴。我觉得这本应是显而易见、不言而喻的事情，但我个人去年看到了太多从头到尾完全由ChatGPT撰写，甚至没有改动一个字的简历。AI倾向于泛化，AI倾向于夸大，AI并不总是准确的，信息需要经过审查和事实核查。不要盲目依赖它来撰写一份开启你与潜在雇主之间全部关系的文档。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this leads me to my next point: what changes are we going to be seeing in talent acquisition (人才招聘：指企业寻找、吸引、评估和聘用合格人才的过程) strategies going forward? AI will be used a lot in identifying which resumes will make it through to the interview round. I hope I don't have to explain to anybody that AI can detect AI. Please do not use ChatGPT (OpenAI开发的大型语言模型) or Claude (Anthropic开发的大型语言模型) blindly to write your resumes by simply copying and pasting. I feel like this is such an obvious thing and should go without saying, but I personally have seen so many resumes last year that were written entirely by ChatGPT from start to finish without changing a word. AI tends to generalize, AI tends to exaggerate, AI isn't always accurate, and the information needs to be reviewed and fact-checked. Don't rely on it blindly to write a document that starts your entire relationship with a potential employer.</p>
</details>

### “重返办公室”趋势与混合办公模式

劳动力市场将适应新的现实。**混合办公**（hybrid work：结合远程工作和办公室工作的模式）模式正成为趋势，40%的雇主支持这种混合安排。基于技能的薪酬制度正在获得发展势头，特别是在AI、网络安全和数据科学等高需求领域。“重返办公室”趋势：混合办公模式将出现重大转变，40%的雇主支持混合模式，而完全远程工作的比例从2024年的21%下降到7%。公司将要求每周至少三天到办公室办公。要求到办公室办公的公司比例将从去年的37%增加到53%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The labor market is going to be adapting to new realities. There is a trend towards hybrid work (混合办公：结合远程工作和办公室工作的模式), with 40% of employers supporting mixed arrangements. Skill-based pay is gaining momentum, particularly in high-demand fields like AI, cybersecurity, and data science. The great office return: there's going to be a big shift toward hybrid work models, with 40% of employers supporting the mixed model, while fully remote work declined to 7% from 21% in 2024. Companies will be requiring in-office presence at least three days a week. Companies requiring in-office presence will increase to 53% compared to 37% last year.</p>
</details>

许多大公司正在2025年实施更严格的返岗政策。例如，你可能已经听说，**亚马逊**（Amazon：全球电商和云计算巨头）要求从2025年1月开始，员工每周五天到办公室办公，这标志着其从之前的混合模式发生了重大转变。**美国电话电报公司**（AT&T：美国最大的电信公司之一）要求所有员工从2025年1月开始每周五天到现场工作。**摩根大通**（JPMorgan：全球领先的金融服务公司）将到办公室办公的要求提高到每周三天，高级领导则要求每周五天到现场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many major companies are implementing stricter return-to-office policies in 2025. For example, as you've probably heard, Amazon (亚马逊：全球电商和云计算巨头) is requiring a five-day in-office presence starting January 2025, marking a significant shift from their previous hybrid model. AT&T (美国电话电报公司：美国最大的电信公司之一) is requiring all staff to work on-site five days a week beginning January 2025. JPMorgan (摩根大通：全球领先的金融服务公司) increased its in-office presence requirement to three days a week, with senior leaders being on-site five days a week.</p>
</details>

这一趋势并非仅限于大公司；**毕马威**（KPMG：全球四大会计师事务所之一）2025年的一项调查证实，83%的首席执行官预计在未来三年内将全面回归办公室。如果你的公司提供完全远程的工作设置，在考虑换工作时要三思。很多人已经习惯了每周五天在家工作，如果这对你很重要，那么在寻找新工作时要谨慎。大多数新职位都要求一定程度的办公室出勤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This trend is not isolated to large companies; a KPMG (毕马威：全球四大会计师事务所之一) survey from 2025 confirms that 83% of CEOs expect a full return to office within the next three years. If your company is offering a fully remote setup, think twice before changing roles. A lot of people got accustomed to being at home five days a week, and if that is something that matters to you, be careful when you look for a new job. The majority of new roles require some degree of in-office presence.</p>
</details>

现在，我们来看看推动这一转变的因素：协作与创新。许多高管认为，面对面的办公室文化能促进更好的协作和创新。人们越来越关注在远程环境中维护和加强企业文化。还存在生产力方面的担忧；一些领导者认为，办公室工作能带来更高的生产力和所有团队更高的参与度，尽管这一点仍有争议。经济不确定性：在经济不稳定时期，公司更倾向于对员工进行更直接的监督。混合办公通常被视为一种折衷方案，它既提供了灵活性，又保持了一定程度的面对面协作。有趣的是，与那些完全在办公室工作或完全远程工作的员工相比，混合办公的员工通常报告称他们与团队和工作的联系感更强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, onto the factors that are driving this shift: collaboration and innovation. Many executives believe that in-person office culture fosters better collaboration and innovation. There is a growing concern about maintaining and strengthening corporate culture in a remote environment. There are productivity concerns; some leaders argue that in-office work leads to higher productivity and higher engagement across all teams, although this remains a point of debate. Economic uncertainty: in times of economic instability, companies prefer more direct oversight of their workforce. Hybrid work is often seen as a compromise that offers flexibility while maintaining some in-person collaboration. Interestingly, hybrid workers often report feeling more connected to their teams and their work compared to those who work exclusively in person or exclusively remote.</p>
</details>

现在，这些因素在多份报告中都被列为推动这一转变的驱动因素，坦率地说，在这一点上，我个人认为你是否同意这些因素甚至都不重要。我个人不同意其中一半的观点，但我认为这些意见不会被纳入考量。公司正在迅速转向混合模式，即使是那些多年来一直远程办公的公司，现在也要求员工每周至少到岗两次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, those factors are being listed as drivers of this shift across multiple reports, and frankly, at this point, I personally think that it doesn't even matter whether you agree or not with those factors. I personally disagree with half of them, but I don't think those opinions are going to be taken into consideration. Companies are rapidly shifting to a hybrid model, and even the ones who have been remote for years are now asking employees to show up at least twice a week.</p>
</details>

### 以员工福祉为中心的工作模式

最后一个趋势是围绕**以员工福祉为中心的工作模式**（wellness-centric employment）。心理健康和整体福祉将继续成为一个趋势，并将成为人才招聘策略的核心组成部分之一。组织正在制定超越传统健康福利的全面员工福祉计划，因此你将开始看到更多预算被分配到心理健康假、心理治疗和冥想等方面。这一转变反映出一种更深层次的理解：顶尖人才越来越重视那些真正致力于员工福祉的组织。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the last trend is around wellness-centric employment (以员工福祉为中心的工作模式). Mental health and overall well-being continue to be a trend, and it's going to be one of the central components of talent acquisition strategies. Organizations are developing comprehensive wellness plans beyond traditional health benefits, so you will start seeing more budget allocated towards mental health days, therapy, and meditation. This shift reflects a deeper understanding that top talent increasingly prioritizes organizations that demonstrate genuine commitment to employee well-being.</p>
</details>

希望这些信息对你有所帮助。如果我没有提到任何趋势，请在下方留言；我很乐意继续这个对话。我个人对未来五年即将发生的事情感到有些兴奋。我享受了多年的完全远程工作设置，就我个人而言，我不会说它影响了我的生产力，但我非常好奇你们的想法。请在评论中告诉我。下次再见，再会。

<p class="english-text">I hope this was helpful. If there are any trends I haven't mentioned, please mention them below; I'm happy to continue this conversation. I am personally semi-excited for what's about to happen in the next five years. I've enjoyed the fully remote setup for many years, and personally, I wouldn't say that it impacted my productivity, but I am very curious to hear about what you guys think. Let me know in the comments. Till next time, bye.</p>
