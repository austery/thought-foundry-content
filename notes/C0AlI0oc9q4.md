title: 从500亿公司离职：创业教会我的生存法则与GenAI愿景
---
### 创业公司的生存法则：没有安全网的拼搏

当然，在创业公司最大的不同就是你没有任何安全网。你确实需要一种远超你生活中所见的拼搏精神。你没有时间坐下来思考，你必须直接处理问题并持续推进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the biggest thing that is different of course being in a startup is that you don't have any safety net. You really need to have a hustle that goes way beyond anything you've seen in life. You don't have any time to sit and think. You just have to deal with it and keep rolling.</p>
</details>

我想说，我将来会做出的最大改变是，确保加入公司的人理解这里没有安全网的事实。我们经历过不少人员流动，甚至早期团队的成员也不得不离开。部分原因在于，他们可能在大公司是完美的候选人或员工，在中型公司是出色的候选人，但在小型公司却格格不入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say the biggest thing I'll do differently is to make sure that people who come to the company understand the fact that there's no safety net. And we've had our fair share of turnovers. And even people who were in the early early teams, we've had to let go. Partly because they may be perfect candidates, perfect employees in a large company, perfect candidates or outstanding candidates in a medium company, but a terrible misfit in a small company.</p>
</details>

我来告诉你一个常见的对话场景。我们要求去拜访客户或做一些事情，然后期待一周后会有进展。你去问他们：“嘿，这事办成了吗？”他们会说：“没有，我发了邮件，还在等回复。”在大公司里，这完全是一个合理的说法，没问题，你会得到回复。通常，如果你在**亚马逊**（Amazon: 全球最大的在线零售商和云计算服务提供商之一）、**谷歌**（Google: 全球最大的搜索引擎和互联网服务公司之一）或**微软**（Microsoft: 全球领先的软件、服务和设备公司），你发出请求，人们会回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I'll tell you a general conversation that would usually go. We ask for say going and meeting with a customer or something. We're expecting a week goes by. You go ask them, "Hey, did this get done?" And they'll say, "No, I sent an email. We still waiting for a response." Now, in a large company, that's a perfectly fair statement to make. No problem. You'll get a response. And typically, say you're an Amazon or you're in Google or Microsoft, you send a response, people respond back.</p>
</details>

但如果你从一家创业公司发送邮件，他们通常不会回复。大多数时候，他们没有时间这样做。其次，我们也没有时间等待。我们会发邮件，然后打电话给那个人，再发短信，如果需要的话，甚至会给他们的妻子发短信，以确保我们得到回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The same people, if you're sending an email from a startup, they don't respond. Most of the time, they don't have time to do that. But second, we don't have the time to wait. We send an email, then call the person, then text the person, and text their wife if we have to to make sure we get a response.</p>
</details>

甚至有过这样的情况，我们会说：“你看，你想让我去接你的孩子吗？这样我能和你聊15分钟。”这种拼搏精神你在其他任何工作中都很少需要，但在这里你必须拥有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There have been cases where we would say, "Look, do you want me to go pick up your kids so that I can actually get 15 minutes with you?" It's that kind of hustle that you rarely almost ever need in any other job, but you need it here.</p>
</details>

为此，你还需要谦逊，因为通常你会说：“我是CEO，我不能去做那种事。”但实际上恰恰相反，你必须做所有事情。这意味着，我每天可以工作18小时，每周工作7天，但仍然完不成30%的任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for that, you also need humility because normally you would say, well, I am the CEO. I can't be going and doing something. It's exactly the opposite. In fact, you have to do everything. Meaning, I can work 18 hours a day. I can work 7 days a week. I would still not get to even 30% of my tasks.</p>
</details>

如果你在一家早期创业公司，根本没有所谓的**工作与生活平衡**（work-life balance）。别自欺欺人了，工作就是生活，它们是一回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're an early stage startup, there is no such thing called work life balance. Don't kid yourself. That is work. That is life. It's the same thing.</p>
</details>

### 创业精神的真谛与Articul8的使命

创业的真正定义是：旨在做一些你没有足够资源去完成的事情。这就是创业的定义。我是**Articul8**的创始人兼CEO **Arun Subramaniyan**。Articul8是一个**领域特定通用人工智能平台**（domain-specific GenAI platform: 专注于特定行业或应用场景的生成式人工智能平台），它使企业能够从其深厚的领域专业知识和数十年来收集的数据中获取价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The real definition of entrepreneurship is aiming to do something for which you don't have the resources. That's the definition of entrepreneurship. I am Arun Subraman, founder and CEO of Articulate. Articulate is a domain specific Genai platform that enables enterprises to get value from their deep domain expertise and data they've collected over decades.</p>
</details>

我成长在一个技术是理所当然的家庭。在80年代和90年代，典型的印度式成长环境认为，你必须在学校表现出色，这是首要任务。甚至在我上大学之前，我就对任何会飞的东西着迷。很早我就想成为一名航空航天工程师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I grew up in a family where technology was a given. Normal quintessentially Indian uh upbringing in the 80s and '90s assumed that you have to do well in school. That was the number one priority. I was fascinated by anything that flew even before I got to college. And very early on I wanted to be an aerospace engineer.</p>
</details>

当时很少有地方可以学习航空航天工程，我很幸运能进入顶尖学府之一。我去了**安娜大学**（Anna University），那里有一所名为**马塔斯理工学院**（Matas Institute of Technology）的学校。我的大学教育对我来说一直充满乐趣。我在那里完成了本科学习，然后去**普渡大学**（Purdue: 美国著名的研究型大学，尤其在航空航天领域享有盛誉）攻读研究生。许多人可能不知道，普渡大学被称为宇航员的摇篮，美国大多数宇航员都来自这所学校。**尼尔·阿姆斯特朗**（Neil Armstrong: 首位登上月球的人类）就毕业于普渡大学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there are very few places you could go to study aerospace engineering at the time and I was lucky enough to get into one of the top schools. I went to Anna University and there's a school called Matas Institute of Technology. My college education was just fun for me all the way through. So I finished undergrad there went off to do my graduate studies at Purdue. Many people may not know this is called uh the birthplace or cradle of astronaut is a school where most astronauts in the US actually come from. Neil Armstrong actually graduated from Purdue.</p>
</details>

### 责任感与回馈社会

有一件事深深触动了我，我以前从未那样想过。那是我上大学的时候，我参加了一个人的研讨会，他说了一些我从未思考过的事情：你需要感受到**所有权**（ownership）和**责任**（responsibility）才能真正提供帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is a particular incident that deeply touched me. I had never thought about it that way. This was when I was in college. I was attending a seminar by somebody and he said something that I had never thought about. You need to feel ownership and responsibility to actually help.</p>
</details>

这意味着什么呢？他举了一个例子：想想那些最早设计和建造水坝的人。无论他们是谁，他们都阻止了河流的泛滥。在他们开始建造水坝的时候，洪水被认为是“天灾”。无论你身处何种文化，人们都真心希望洪水不再发生，人们不再死亡，不再遭受苦难。他们并没有坐下来想：“哦，这是天灾，上帝要降下洪水，我们无能为力。”他们实际上认为“我会帮助人们不再受苦”，并真的去建造水坝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what that means is he gave an example which is think of the people who first designed dams and built dams. Whoever they might be, they stopped the flow of rivers. At the time that they started building dams, it was all an act of God. Wherever whichever culture you were, they really wanted to make sure that floods didn't happen. They didn't people didn't die. They didn't suffer. They didn't sit and think, "Oh, this is an act of God. God wanted floods to come in. We can't do anything." They actually thought that I will help people not suffer and actually go build dams.</p>
</details>

当他们第一次建造水坝时，那几乎是不可能完成的任务。现在，这已是自然而然的事情，当然，工程奇迹随处可见，我们到处建造水坝。但对于第一个想到这样做的人来说并非如此。想想那个人为了阻止“天灾”所承担的责任，对吗？那是一项巨大的责任。他们不仅那样想了，还真的去建造了水坝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When they first built it, it's an impossible act to be doing. Now, it's a natural thing. Sure, engineering marvels. We build dams all over the place. But it's not for the first person to have thought about it. Think of the responsibility the person took to stop an act of God, right? And that's a massive responsibility. And not only they they thought about it that way, they went and built the dam.</p>
</details>

如果你从所有权和责任的角度思考，你不需要拥有任何东西才能承担责任。你可以做自己的小事，在任何人的生活中产生巨大的影响。这对我个人产生了非常大的影响，因为当时我可能还是个青少年，用这种方式思考生活让我感到震撼。在此之前，我只是觉得世界在我身边自然发生，我们没有想过我们能在世界上创造什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you actually think about it from the perspective of ownership and responsibility, you don't need to have anything to take responsibility. You can do your own small thing to make a massive impact in anybody's life. That made a very personal impact for me because it was mind-blowing to me as at that time probably I was still a teenager to think about life like that. Until then I just thought like the world just happened around me. We didn't think we manifested something in the world right that's one thing.</p>
</details>

第二件深深影响我的事情是**回馈社会**（paying it forward）的概念。我在**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊的云计算服务部门）工作时，我们运行模拟，帮助扩展了**新冠疫情**（COVID-19）传播预测的模拟。当时新冠疫情刚刚开始，封锁从未在任何地方发生过，没有哪个州曾关闭过任何东西。我们帮助加利福尼亚州的一个部门扩展了他们的模拟，以预测加州何时可能出现病床耗尽的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing that affected me very deeply was the concept of paying it forward. So when I was in AWS we ran the simulations helped scale the simulations for running COVID predictions in terms of spread of COVID. And at the time of course COVID was just starting. The shutdowns had never happened anywhere else. No state had ever shut anything down. And we helped one of the state of California divisions scale their simulations to predict when the state of California is potentially going to run out of beds.</p>
</details>

我们最终所做的就是帮助他们将模型大规模部署到计算资源上，因为这是我们擅长的。模拟预测，大约5天内，加州的总病床数将耗尽。这项模拟，连同他们拥有的所有其他数据，对加州宣布首次全州范围的封锁起到了关键作用。同样的模拟今天仍被许多国家运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we ended up doing was we helped them take their models and then scale them on massive amount of compute cuz that's what we're really good at doing. And it predicted that in 5 days or so the total number of beds in California would be exhausted. And uh that simulation along with all the other data they had was instrumental in the state of California announcing the first statewide shutdown. And that same simulation is being run by many countries today.</p>
</details>

这是一个深深触动人心的项目，因为我加入亚马逊时，并没有想到我会做这样的事情。当时我们没有意识到，但它对世界上许多事情产生了巨大影响。我们所做的工作以微小的方式帮助世界变得更美好，这确实令人感到谦卑。用**史蒂夫·乔布斯**（Steve Jobs: 苹果公司联合创始人）的话说，这就像“在宇宙中留下一个印记”。但它真正想表达的是，无论我们身处何地，无论我们做多么微小的事情，都要确保我们离开时，这个地方比我们发现它时更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was a a deeply touching project to be working on because I didn't go to Amazon thinking that's what I would be doing. At the time we didn't realize it but it had a huge impact on a lot of things in the world. And it is truly humbling that the work we did helped in a small way in making the world a better place. In Steve Jobs's world, it is like make a dent in the universe. But it's really around saying, look, whatever we find ourselves in, whatever little we do, make sure that we leave the place in a better world than we found it.</p>
</details>

我们团队中的这些人，我想说他们没有人需要这份工作。他们没有人需要每天在这里工作无数小时。他们在这里是因为他们相信我们的使命。他们相信我们为什么做我们所做的事情，以及我们如何做我们所做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The group of people that we have with us, I would say none of them need this job. None of them need to be here working God knows how many hours they're working daily. They're here because they believe in the mission. They believe in why we do what we do and how we do what we do.</p>
</details>

### 从失败中学习：Articul8的诞生

如果你问我我的职业生涯是如何建立起来的，那真的是因为我“傻到”不会说不。我之所以用这个词，是因为每当我遇到问题时，即使在很早的时候，我也不知道其他人根本不会碰那个问题。我之所以得到它，是因为我傻到没有问“我们为什么要这样做？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you ask me how my career got built is really being dumb enough not to say no. And the reason I use the word is whenever a problem was given to me even very early days I didn't know that other people would never touch that problem. It was given to me because I was silly enough not to ask why would we do this?</p>
</details>

我们基本上会说：“哦，这是一个有趣的问题。让我去尝试解决它。”我失败的次数比成功的次数多。但当我成功的时候，我成功地完成了其他人认为不可能完成的事情。那些最有价值、最困难的问题，而且失败是可以接受的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We basically said oh it is an interesting problem. Let me go try solving it. I failed more often than I succeeded. But the times I succeeded, I succeeded in things that everybody else said cannot be done. The problems that were the highest value, the problems that were the most difficult to do and failure was okay.</p>
</details>

事情是这样开始的：我当时在**英特尔**（Intel: 全球最大的半导体芯片制造商之一），领导云和**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机科学领域）战略及执行团队。我的职责是帮助英特尔销售更多人工智能硬件。但我们知道最大的工作负载是**大型语言模型**（large language models）。**通用人工智能**（GenAI: Generative AI: 生成式人工智能）即将发生。那是2022年，在**ChatGPT**（由OpenAI开发的人工智能聊天机器人）推出前6个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the way it started was I was at Intel. I was leading the cloud and AI strategy and execution teams. My charter was to help Intel sell more AI hardware. But we knew that the largest workload was large language models. Genai is going to happen. This is 2022. And this was 6 months before Chad GBD was launched.</p>
</details>

所以我们建造了一台人工智能超级计算机，然后试图为其构建一个模型。我们实际上与一家非常大的公司合作，试图让他们购买英特尔硬件，项目一直进展到最终批准阶段，然后一切都崩溃了。在谁来资助哪些部分方面存在误解，这导致项目完全停止，就像火箭在发射台上爆炸一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we had built an AI supercomputer and then we were trying to build a model for that one. And we actually worked with a very large company trying to get them to buy Intel hardware and the project went all the way up to a final approval where everything broke loose. There was a misunderstanding in terms of who was going to fund what portions of it which basically ended up being the project completely stopping and it almost like the rocket analogy is the rocket blew up on the launchpad.</p>
</details>

那是一切开始的失败。但因为我们已经完成了建模，我们便去拜访客户说：“嘿，我们可以为你做这个。你想做吗？”他们说：“哦，好吧。我们可以试试这个。我们来做一个搜索模型。”我们实际上为他们构建了一个模型。那个模型最终变成了一个软件产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was a failure everything started with. But because we had already done the modeling, we then went to a customer and said, "Hey, we can do this for you. Would you want to do this?" They said, "Oh, okay. We can try this. Let's do a search model." We actually built a model for them. That model ended up being a software product.</p>
</details>

我们开发了软件，做了所有这些都是为了销售硬件。客户回来后说：“也许我们会在某个时候购买你的硬件。我能购买你的软件吗？”所以，从某种意义上说，这是第二次最大的失败。我们试图销售硬件，但没能成功，却成功销售了软件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We built the software. We did all that to sell hardware. The customer comes back and says, "Maybe we'll buy your hardware at some point. Can I buy your software?" So, in a sense, that was the second biggest failure. We tried to sell hardware. We couldn't sell the hardware, but we could sell the software.</p>
</details>

在一年内，我们从一个几乎板上钉钉、本将成为最大项目的项目失败，然后我们又去争取另一个销售硬件的项目，那个项目也失败了。最终，演变成了**Articul8**这家公司。如果你想想，如果我们第一次失败就停止了，我们就永远不会有第二个项目。如果我们第二次失败就停止了，我们就永远不会有Articul8。从失败的项目中扭转局势的角度来看，无论我们跌倒多少次，我们都能重新站起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And within a year, we went from having a project that is almost in the bag that was already going to become the biggest project out there. That project failed. Then we went and got another project to sell hardware. That project also failed. Ended up being Articulate the Company. And if you think about if we had stopped at the first failure, we would have never gotten the second project. If we had stopped at the second failure, we would have never got an articulate. The perspective of looking at it from failed projects getting turned around. Doesn't matter how many times we fall down, can we actually get up.</p>
</details>

### Articul8的独特策略：生产级试点

我们公司遵循的原则是，我们通常不做**概念验证**（PoC: Proof of Concept: 验证某个想法或技术可行性的小规模项目）。我们只做**生产级试点**（Production Pilot: 在真实生产环境中进行的小规模、高复杂度的验证项目）。你可能会问有什么区别？区别在于，PoC是任何人都可以做的事情。老实说，即使是一个对这些工具足够了解的高中生，也能用几十份文档构建一个PoC。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Say principles we go by in the company which is we typically do not do PC's. PC's meaning proofs of concept. We only do production pilots. You may ask what's the difference? The difference is a P is something that anybody can do. Honestly, even a high school student with a good enough knowledge of some of these tools can build a PC with a few tens of documents.</p>
</details>

PoC和生产级试点之间的区别在于，试点是生产规模的。你必须处理最复杂的用例。事实上，我们会走进客户那里说：“把你们最混乱的数据集给我们。把你们最复杂的问题给我们，让我们向你展示如何将其投入生产。”对吗？这就是我们所说的生产级试点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The difference between a PC and a pilot is pilot is production scale. You have to go after your most complex use cases. In fact, we go into a customer and say, "Give us your messiest of data set. Give us your most complex problem and let's actually show you how to actually take that to production." Right? That's what we mean by a production pilot.</p>
</details>

生产级试点和PoC的另一个巨大区别是，一旦你完成了生产级试点，启动生产就只是签署合同的问题了。所有的技术工作都已经完成。你可能会问的第三件事是，这意味着这应该需要很长时间才能完成。我们实际上将生产级试点的时间限制在4到8周。不能超过这个时间。即使是我们做的最复杂的用例，也完全在8周内完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other big difference between a production pilot and a PC is once you're done with your production pilot, turning on the production is just a matter of a contract signing. All the technical work is already done. And the third thing you might ask is okay that means this should take a long time to do. We actually cap production pilots to be between 4 to 8 weeks long. No more than that. Even the most complex of use cases that we do is entirely done within 8 weeks.</p>
</details>

这非常重要，因为当客户听到这样的说法时，比如“给我一个干净整洁的数据集，它经过精心策划，给我一个小问题，让我向你展示它确实有效”，然后你完成PoC，要投入生产却需要6个月或一年。根据最新的**麻省理工学院**（MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology: 世界顶尖的理工大学）研究，95%的GenAI项目未能投入生产，就是因为人们做了PoC，但项目从未向前推进。这是一种非常不同的理念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very important because when a customer hears this statement which is like give me a nice clean data set and it's nicely curated give me a small problem for me to show you that it actually works after you make the P to get to production it ends up taking 6 months or a year and most of the projects if you see the latest MIT study that said 95% of genai projects don't go to production is because of that because people do PC and it never moves forward but it's a very different uh philosophy.</p>
</details>

### GenAI市场与差异化价值

几个月前，据统计，世界上有28,600家自称是GenAI的创业公司。我相信这个数字现在已经翻了一倍多。原因在于，我相信每个人都认为他们正在解决一个重要的问题。我不认为有人会出去创办一家公司，或者如此努力地解决一个他们不认为重要的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last count a few months ago, there were 28,600 startups in the world that claimed to be Gen AI startups. I'm sure the number is more than doubled since. The reason for that is everybody, I believe, believes that they're solving an important problem. I don't think anybody goes out and starts a startup or works so hard to solve a problem they don't believe is important.</p>
</details>

然而，他们解决的问题处于不同的领域，他们解决的问题是他们认为热门的领域。现在，解决问题有两种方式，处理问题也有两种方式。第一种方式当然是追逐热门领域，这就是**红海理论**（Red Ocean Theory: 竞争激烈的现有市场）。或者，你可以追逐**蓝海理论**（Blue Ocean Theory: 尚未开发或竞争较少的市场）中的事物，那里没有人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, what they're solving for is in different domains and what they're solving for is in domains that they think is hot. Now, there's two ways to solve a problem, two ways to tackle a problem. The first way is, of course, go after where things are hot. That's the red ocean theory. Or go after things that are the blue ocean theory, where there's nobody there.</p>
</details>

现在，少有人走的路之所以少有人走，是有原因的，它很艰难，充满了比人多的路更多的失败。但这真的取决于你有什么样的承受能力，你真正在解决什么问题，以及你有什么资源可以去做。我认为没有一个正确或错误的答案，这只是关乎对你个人而言什么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a path less traveled is less traveled for a reason, is hard, and it's filled with more failures than the path more traveled with. But it really depends on what you have stomach for and what you're actually going and solving and what you have resources for that you can go do that. I don't think there is any one right or wrong answer. It is just about what is personal for you.</p>
</details>

那么，我相信这些公司会产生影响吗？绝对会。它们已经在产生影响了。它们已经从根本上改变了世界，以至于世界将不再是原来的样子。**OpenAI**也做了同样的事情。OpenAI刚开始时是一家小型创业公司，他们从根本上改变了世界，我认为这种改变将继续增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now do I believe that these companies are going to make an impact? Absolutely. They already are. They've changed the way the world in so many fundamental ways that it's no longer going to be the same. Same thing that OpenAI did. Open AAI was a small startup when they started. they have fundamentally changed the world and I think that's going to continue growing.</p>
</details>

我们相信，最容易实现的目标首先是市场上最拥挤的领域。每家公司都是一家GenAI公司，每家大公司都在尝试用GenAI做些什么。他们会去哪里？他们通常会去营销、财务、人力资源部门，部分原因是因为这是最容易实现的目标，因为你有用例，但即使犯了错误，也不会有太大改变，这不是一个威胁公司生存的事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That we believe that the lowhanging fruit is first and foremost the most crowded market out there every company is a geni company and every large company is trying to do something with genai where do they go they usually go to marketing they go to finance they go to HR partly because it's the lowest hanging fruit because you have use cases but if you make a mistake not much is going to change it's not a a company threatening event.</p>
</details>

然而，如果你看看公司正在做的最重要的事情，它大多与这些无关。一家制造公司从事制造，一家航空航天公司会进行设计、制造或维护。我们则专注于这些特定领域的用例。我们实际上追求的是能为公司营收带来巨大差异化的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, if If you look at what is the most important thing that the company is doing, it's mostly not related to any of these things. A manufacturing company does manufacturing. An aerospace company would do design or manufacturing or maintenance. We go after use cases in those particular segments. And we actually go after what makes a big difference for the company's topline.</p>
</details>

原因在于，如果一家公司能够真正找到新的业务，找到利用AI赚钱的新方法，那将是更持久的。而提高生产力的用例通常追求的是底线，这是每个人都会做的事情，无论你今天是否喜欢或正在做，每家公司都会使用一些生产力工具来利用AI用例，以减轻他们的负担，但这不会给任何公司带来差异化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason for that is if a company can actually find new business, find new ways to make money out of AI, that is something that will be longerlasting. Whereas productivity use cases typically go after the bottom line which everybody's going to do whether you like it or not today you're doing it or not every company is going to use some productivity tool to get their AI use case to reduce their burden for what they're doing that's not going to give differentiation for any company.</p>
</details>

所以我们相信，我们致力于为公司带来差异化的事情，这能给你带来更持久的价值。我们还有一个基本理念，那就是我们的业务建立在我们为你的业务增加了价值这一事实上。因此，我们可以分享这些价值，这就是我们业务增长的方式。我们的业务不一定是通过让你更高效来增长的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we believe that we work on things that give a company differentiation that gives you longerlasting value and we also have a philosophy that we fundamentally grounded on saying look we build our business based on the fact that we added value to your business. So we can share in the value that's how our business grows. Our business is not necessarily growing by making you more efficient.</p>

### 创业的内在驱动力与技术民主化

当然，在创业公司最大的不同就是你没有任何安全网。就像我经历过的其他任何工作一样，总有人可以寻求帮助，但最终责任在我。这意味着责任止于我，这在创业中是一个巨大的变化。这花了一点时间来适应，但像这样在创业公司的好处是，你没有时间坐下来思考。你只需要处理问题并持续推进，对吗？

<p class="english-text">So the biggest thing that is different of course being in a startup is that you don't have any safety net like any other job I've had there's always somebody who I could go to for help but ultimately the responsibility lies with me. Meaning the buck stops with me which is a huge change when it comes to it. That took a little bit of time to adjust, but the nice thing about being in a startup like this is you don't have any time to sit and think. You just have to deal with it and keep rolling, right?</p>
</details>

所以这是一件好事，因为你没有时间抓狂。我想说，我将来会做出的最大改变是，确保加入公司的人理解这里没有安全网的事实。我们经历过不少人员流动，甚至早期团队的成员也不得不离开。部分原因在于，他们可能在大公司是完美的候选人或员工，在中型公司是出色的候选人，但在小型公司却格格不入。

<p class="english-text">So that's a good thing because you don't have the time to freak out. Uh I would say the biggest thing I'll do differently is to make sure that people who come to the company understand the fact that there's no safety net. And we've had our fair share of turnovers. And even people who were in the early early teams, we've had to let go. Partly because they may be perfect candidates, perfect employees in a large company, perfect candidates or outstanding candidates in a medium company, but a terrible misfit in a small company.</p>
</details>

原因在于，你确实需要一种远超你生活中所见的拼搏精神。我来告诉你一个常见的对话场景。我们要求去拜访客户或做一些事情。我们期待一周后会有进展。你去问他们：“嘿，这事办成了吗？”他们会说：“没有，我发了邮件，还在等回复。”在大公司里，这完全是一个合理的说法，没问题，你会得到回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason for that is you really need to have a hustle that goes way beyond anything you've seen in life. Like I'll tell you a general conversation that would usually go. We ask for say going and meeting with a customer or something. we are expecting a week goes by you go ask them hey did this get done and they'll say no I sent an email we are still waiting for a response now in a large company that's a perfectly fair statement to make no problem you'll get a response.</p>
</details>

通常，如果你在亚马逊、谷歌或微软，你发出请求，人们会回复。但如果你从一家创业公司发送邮件，他们通常不会回复。大多数时候，他们没有时间这样做。其次，我们也没有时间等待。我们会发邮件，然后打电话给那个人，再发短信，如果需要的话，甚至会给他们的妻子发短信，以确保我们得到回复。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And typically say you're an Amazon or you're in Google or Microsoft you send a response people respond back the same people if you're sending an email from a startup they don't respond most of the time they don't have time to do that but second we don't have the time to wait we send an email then call the person then text the person and text their wife if we have to to make sure we get a response.</p>
</details>

甚至有过这样的情况，我们会说：“你看，你想让我去接你的孩子吗？这样我能和你聊15分钟？”这种拼搏精神你在其他任何工作中都很少需要，但在这里你必须拥有。为此，你还需要谦逊，因为通常你会说：“我是CEO，我不能去做那种事。”但实际上恰恰相反，你必须做所有事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There have been cases where we would say, "Look, do you want me to go pick up your kids so that I can actually get 15 minutes with you?" It's that kind of hustle that you rarely almost ever need in any other job, but you need it here. And for that, you also need humility because normally you would say, "Well, I am the CEO. I can't be going and doing something." It's exactly the opposite. In fact, you have to do everything.</p>
</details>

这意味着，我每天可以工作18小时，每周工作7天，但仍然完不成30%的任务。如果你在一家早期创业公司，根本没有所谓的**工作与生活平衡**。别自欺欺人了，工作就是生活，它们是一回事。这就是现实。只是人们的心态必须非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meaning, I can work 18 hours a day. I can work 7 days a week. I would still not get to even 30% of my tasks. If you're in an early stage startup, there is no such thing called work life balance. Don't kid yourself. There is work, there is life, it's the same thing. It's what it is. It's just that the people's mindset has to be very different.</p>
</details>

我在清理办公室里的咖啡杯时不会三思。如果我必须这样做，如果我看到什么并且有时间，我就会毫不犹豫地去做。如果我必须是那个去和最大的投资者谈话、筹集资金的人，我也会去做。所以，没有所谓的工作是“低于你身份”的，也没有所谓你可以“只委托然后走开”的事情。你不能委托责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think twice before clearing out all the coffee cups in the office. If that's what I have to do, if I see something and I have the time, I no problem doing it. If I have to be the one going and talking to the the biggest investor out there raising money, I will do that too. So there's no such thing called a job is beneath you and there's also no such thing called you can just delegate and walk away. You cannot delegate responsibility.</p>
</details>

有些人问我，你一直想创办一家创业公司吗？答案是否定的。我很高兴成为一名研究员。我接受了研究员的培训，最终也成为了研究员。我非常满意。商业方面完全是偶然。我没有上商学院。我所学到的所有商业知识都是在工作中获得的。

<p class="english-text">Some of the people have asked me a question like have you always wanted to start a startup? Answer is no. I was happy being a researcher. I trained to be a researcher and I ended up becoming one. I was more than happy. The business side was entirely accidental. I didn't go to business school. Everything I learned about business is what I learned in the job.</p>
</details>

对我来说，这又回到了“糖果店里的孩子”的时刻，因为我们正在解决很少有人会解决的问题。为什么技术的**民主化**（democratization of technology: 使技术更容易被大众获取和使用）对我来说很重要？部分原因在于它是一个普世的均衡器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me, it's a kid in a candy store moment all over again because we're solving problems that very few people would solve. Why is democratization of technology important for me? Partly because it's a universal equalizer.</p>
</details>

原因在于，想想科学、数学，甚至哲学，它们总体上是普世的。它具有深刻的解放性。无论人们身在何处，都没有不平等可言。如果你真的让人们更容易地使用它，那是你能回馈社会最公平的事情。这正是我们一直以来的动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason for that is think about science and math and even say philosophy in general is universal. It's deeply liberating. There is no inequality respect of where they are. And if you actually allow people to use that more easily that's the most equitable thing you can do back to the society and uh that's really what's been driving.</p>
</details>

而且，如果你看看，这也源于我的成长经历。我成长在一个事物不易获得的时代，比如在我上高中之前，没有有线电视，也没有互联网。今天回想起来，这似乎很疯狂，但从那时到坐在任何咖啡馆里访问世界上任何东西，只用了不到一代人的时间，对吗？它带来的解放是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also if you look at it that also comes from how I grew up like I grew up in a world where things were not easily available like there was no cable TV when I was growing up until I was in high school there was no internet and as crazy as it seems to think about it today going from there to sitting in any coffee shop accessing anything in the world happened in less than a lifetime, right? The unlock it gives is massive.</p>

想想那些可能没有资源、没有背景的孩子，能够因此改善他们的生活。这才是真正驱动我们的力量。我喜欢“民主化”这个词的原因是，这是你能做的最公平的事情。你正在帮助人们从他们所处的任何境况中振作起来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Think of the child who may not necessarily have the resources, may not have the backing being able to actually improve their life because of this. That's really what drives us. And the reason why I like the word democratization is it's the most equitable thing you can do. You are enabling people to pick themselves up from whatever situation they find themselves in.</p>

我们中的一些人非常幸运，能够接受教育，能够身处这些地方，亲眼看到这些事物并从中学习。很多人没有那么幸运。在十年内，我们将成为全球任何领域、任何特定领域应用的首选平台。这才是我们追求的使命。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Some of us have been super fortunate to to have had education to have had to be in places where we could actually see these things and learn from that. A lot of the people are not as fortunate. By the 10 years, we would have become the platform of choice for domain specific applications anywhere in the world in any domain you have. And that's really the mission that we're after.</p>
</details>

要成为首选平台，我们也必须为所有这些成果提供不成比例的价值回馈。对吗？这是其中一件事。我们改变世界的方式，实际上是确保我们能够让在每家公司工作的每一个人，每天拥有多个**数字孪生**（digital twins: 物理实体或过程的虚拟模型），并能够为自己和公司创造有意义的成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And to become the platform of choice, we also have to be giving disproportionate value back to all of those outcomes. Right? That's the one thing. And the way we would have changed the world really is to make sure that we enable every single person working in every single company to have their own digital twins multiple times a day and be able to make meaningful outcomes for themselves as well as their company.</p>
</details>

**Meta**在他们的超级智能实验室中宣布，他们正在为人们的个人生活做这件事。我们则说，我们将在企业层面实现这一点。十家创业公司中有九家会失败。即使是那1%成功的创业公司，也不会成为Meta或谷歌。但你所承受的痛苦是如此巨大，以至于你真的需要一个内在的指导原则来帮助你度过难关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta announced in their super intelligence lab they're doing that's what they announced that they're going to do for personal life for people outside. We're saying we'll do that for the enterprise. Nine out of 10 startups fail. And even the 1% one startup that succeeds doesn't become a Meta or a Google. But the pain you endure is so massive that you really need to have an inner guiding principle to actually get you past that.</p>
</details>

我想，这根植于我们能够做出微小改变的信念。不是因为我们认为我们比其他人更聪明，而是因为我们有毅力。所以我一直告诉我的团队，也一直告诉我自己：我们可以输，但我们不能被打败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is, I guess, rooted on the belief that we can actually make a small difference. Not because we think we're smarter than anybody else. It's because we have perseverance. So what I keep telling my team and I keep telling myself as well is we can lose but we can't be beat.</p>
</details>

我想说，我最大的力量源泉是我的妻子。她给我的生活带来了平衡，因为我是一个非常不平衡的人。这意味着如果我对某件事充满热情，我就会忘记一切，全身心投入。所以，她教会了我如何带来一种平衡感。这也是我得到了很多人帮助的地方，但我认为除了她之外，没有人能给我这么大的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I would say my greatest source of strength has been my wife. She's somebody who's bought balance in my life because I'm a deeply I would say imbalanced person. Meaning if I get passionate about something, I'll forget everything and just dive in. And so bringing a semblance of balance is something that she taught me. And it's also something where I've been enabled by a lot of people, but I don't think I've been enabled as much by anybody else other than her.</p>
