title: 日本收益率飙升引发市场震荡：Nvidia 竞争加剧与加密货币前景分析
---

### 欢迎回来与感恩节后记
大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是12月1日，星期一，也是今年的最后一个月。我没有迟到，尽管大家都在刷屏说我晚了。我实际上是在8:45前五秒开始的，就为了能准时。

我们回来了。这可能是我一年以来最长的一次直播间歇。说实话，过去四天我都没有直播。这有点疯狂，因为我上一次直播是在周三，然后周四、周五、周六、周日都没有直播，现在我们终于回来了。很高兴能回来，希望大家度过了一个愉快的感恩节。

坦白说，我很享受这段休息时间，因为这大概是一年来我第一次明确地连续四天和家人待在一起。所以我真心希望大家也能和家人共度一些时光。当然，我也很想念这里的每一个人，想念做直播的感觉。但我认为，有时候你确实需要退后一步，尤其是考虑到11月份在情绪上、在大家的心理和投资组合上都经历了多么大的起伏。所以，我认为短暂休息一下是件好事。希望大家至少能有段时间远离市场，专注于橄CCT和家人一起品尝美食、畅谈。

有人说：“现在你讨厌你的家人了。”嗯，这通常是在你和家人待了四天之后会发生的事。不过没有，我过得很愉快。我去了纽约，算是旅行了一下，如果你觉得去纽约也算是一种旅行的话。不过，纽约的消费力可一点也不弱。老兄，我从没在布莱恩特公园见过这么多人。我以前也多次在圣诞节期间去过纽约，但这次真的非常拥挤。所以，我们去了纽约，吃了一些美食，和家人共度时光，真的很享受那种无所事事、坐下来的感觉。

但考虑到我的个性和许多其他热衷于分析金融市场、希望掌握最新动态的人的性格，能回来真是太好了。回来感觉很好，因为能够再次分析全球金融市场正在发生什么，并为这一年画上句号，这显然是非常令人兴奋的。

### 日本国债收益率飙升：市场下跌的导火索
这是最后一个月，我们将最终巩固今年的年度回报。问题是，在接下来的31天里，这些回报将如何最终定型？它们会呈现出怎样的结果？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the last month where we're finally going to be solidifying these year-to-date returns. And the question becomes over the next 31 days, how do these returns end up solidifying? How do these returns end up turning out?</p>
</details>

目前，标普500指数在盘前交易中下跌。不幸的是，我们以一个红色的交易日开场。我们之所以下跌，是有一些原因的。这从昨晚的期货市场就开始了，我们会谈谈为什么会发生这种情况。标普500指数下跌了约0.69%。很大程度上与比特币有关，但比特币并非真正的主角。我认为，这更多地与日本有关。所以，我们会谈谈这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P 500 right here down in the pre-markets. Unfortunately, we are starting off with a bit of a red day. There's some reasons for why we're red. It started last night with the futures. We'll talk about why it's happening. S&P right there down about 69%. A lot of it has to do with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is not the real story. I think a lot of it has to do with Japan. So, we'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

在过去三天里，我一直没有关注市场，直到昨晚期货开盘。当时我想：“好吧，让我们看看过去几天到底发生了什么。”坦白说，除了比特币从91,000美元跌至今早的1.84美元之外，并没有发生太多事情。作为风险偏好的一个指标，随着比特币的下跌，所有风险资产都受到了影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have not focused on the markets over the past three days until last night when the futures opened. And I was like, "All right, let's see what the hell's been happening over the past couple days." And quite frankly, not much has happened except for Bitcoin tanking from 91 to 1.84 this morning. And as a risk-on indicator, that kind of took everything risk off as Bitcoin took a little bit of a dump right here.</p>
</details>

所以，我们会谈谈正在发生的事情。我们会讨论黑色星期五的购物销售情况。我们上周在那些零售商ETF或零售公司中看到了消费者的表现。XRT，作为最大的零售商ETF之一，经历了自五月以来最好的48小时、也就是两天的涨幅。黑色星期五和感恩节的销售数据已经出炉，而且相当不错。根据我们掌握的预测分析，我想网络星期一的销售也会很不错。如果真是这样，随着企业盈利持续改善，消费者在这个假日季可能并不像预期的那么疲软，这或许会成为市场的顺风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we'll talk about what's going on. We'll talk about Black Friday shopping sales. again the consumer we saw in those retail uh retailer ETFs or retailer uh companies last week the XRT which is one of the largest retailer ETFs was had it had its best 48 hour stretch two-day stretch since May uh Black Friday Cyber Monday sales at least Black Friday and Thanksgiving sales are in and it's pretty damn good. I imagine Cyber Monday is going to be pretty good as well based on the analytics we have in terms of the projections. If that's the case maybe that is a bit of a tailwind for the market as earnings continue to get better as the consumer maybe isn't as weak for this holiday season.</p>
</details>

但你看到英伟达下跌1%，Palantir下跌1%，Hoodie下跌3%，亚马逊下跌1%，博通下跌1.5%。还有特斯拉，昨天Michael Burry在他的Substack上称其为最被荒谬高估的公司之一。所以，Burry一直在攻击Palantir和特斯拉、英伟达，现在他又开始攻击特斯拉了。因此，我们将讨论整个股票市场正在发生的一切。目前，标普500指数当日下跌约0.64%，比特币价格为85,800美元，从91,000美元回落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you've got Nvidia down 1%, Palantir down 1%, Hoodie down 3%, Amazon down a percent, Broadcom down 1.5, Tesla which Michael Burry yesterday in his Substack said is the uh is one of the most ridiculously overvalued companies. So you got Burry who has been taking shots at palantir and Tesla Nvidia. Now he's taking shots at Tesla. And so we'll discuss kind of everything that's going on in the broader equity markets. Again, S&P 500 right there down about 64% on the day. Bitcoin 85,800 falling from 91,000.</p>
</details>

### 深入解析日元套利交易与加密市场去杠杆
我认为我们应该从日本开始，对正在发生的事情进行更深入的分析。昨晚，日本的十年期国债收益率大幅飙升，而且升势非常迅猛，我认为这正是导致比特币立即出现大幅下跌的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we should start off with Japan. I think we should start off with Japan to give a little bit more analysis on what's happening. Um, last night Japan's 10-year bond yield shot up and it shot up aggressively and I think that's what kind of caused Bitcoin to immediately take a ugly dip.</p>
</details>

这是日本的整体债券收益率情况。具有讽刺意味的是，就在期货开盘前几个小时，我正在听一个关于日本1990年代崩溃的YouTube视频，也就是所谓的日本“失落的十年”。债券收益率上升不是一件好事，因为这意味着人们在抛售债券，从而推高了收益率。市场基本上在说：“嘿，我们不相信通货膨胀率，我们不相信政府正在实施的财政或货币政策。”结果，就可能发生很多奇怪的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is the overall bond yields in Japan. You know, ironically, I was listening to um I I was listening to a a a story or not a story, it was a YouTube video that was talking about Japan's collapse in the 1990s, kind of that lost decade for Japan. and and and this was like a couple hours before the futures open. And then these are all the bond yields. Bond yields going up is not a good thing because that means people are selling bonds which means the yields are going higher. So the market's basically saying, "Hey, we don't trust the rate of inflation. We don't trust the fiscal or monetary policy that the government is deploying." And as a result, you get a lot of wacky things that could happen.</p>
</details>

那么，为什么这次情况如此糟糕呢？如果你看一下这张图表，日本十年期国债收益率达到了1.838%。这是自2008年以来日本十年期国债的最高收益率。我认为这也是吓到很多人的原因。顺便说一句，之所以会发生这种情况，是因为日本一直在加息的同时还在印钞，这很没有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why was this so bad? Well, if you take a look at this chart right here, 1.838% on the Japanese 10-year bond yield. That is the highest um yield for a Japanese 10-year bond since 2008. And that's what I also think is scaring a lot of people here because and the reason this is happening by the way is because Japan has been simultaneously raising rates while they've also been uh printing money which doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>
</details>

我正在观看的视频也提到了这一点，而且我正在努力研究更多关于日本历史的资料，所以未来几天我会更多地谈论这个话题。但日本确实进行了一些人类历史上最奇怪的经济实验，这些做法让你摸不着头脑，比如他们为什么在1990年这么做？为什么在2000年又那么做？有一段时间，**不良贷款**（Non-Performing Loans, NPLs: 基本上是已经违约、无法收回的贷款）占到了日本GDP的10%。这发生在2000年。为什么？因为日本政府鼓励日本银行去支撑那些已经获得贷款但永远无法偿还的濒临破产的公司，他们直到2008年底情况真正变得一团糟时才进行干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because you can't and and and this is kind of the video that I was watching and and I'm trying to do more research on like the history of Japan so I'll talk more about it over the coming days but it's like Japan has had some of the weirdest economic experiments in in in human history and it's just stuff that makes you scratch your head like why did they do this in 199 1990. Why did they do this in 2000? At one point, non-performing loans, NPLs, so loans that are basically defunct loans, like they're insolvent. You've got to write them off and and you got to realize that you're just never going to get the money paid because your credit underwriting was probably bad. At one point, non-performing loans were 10% of Japan's GDP. This is back in 2000. Why? because the Japanese government encouraged Japanese banks to prop up these failing companies that had been given loans that they were never going to pay back and they only intervened when [ __ ] really hit the fan going into the end of 2008.</p>
</details>

所以，日本发生的事情相当不可思议。现在他们所做的，十年期国债收益率飙升，同时又进行所有这些刺激性印钞，这也没有多大意义。你可以说这对于他们的GDP增长很重要，但同时加息又有点令人困惑。因此，日本正在发生很多奇怪和不稳定的事情，我认为这正是引发比特币抛售的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean it's quite incredible what has happened in Japan and now what they're doing the tenure by the way spiking as well doesn't make a lot of sense either with all the stimulus printing which I mean like you could argue that that is important uh for their GDP growth but also raising rates at the same time is is a bit confusing. So, you've got a lot of weird and wonky stuff happening in Japan, which I think is what triggered the the Bitcoin sell-off.</p>
</details>

那么，关于比特币抛售的逻辑推论是什么？如果日本国债收益率上升，日元兑美元就会升值。当日元兑美元升值时，人们就必须卖掉他们的科技股或其他资产。大多数情况下，最先被抛售的资产是加密资产，因为它们在那个时刻流动性最强，可以24小时交易。这就导致了比特币被卖出，以弥补日元空头头寸。因为存在一个非常方便的**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 借入低利率的日元，投资于高收益的资产），我想现在人们对此已经有所了解，那就是做空日元，借入日元，然后做多科技股、加密货币或其他风险资产。当这种交易的风险暴露时，最终会导致美国市场的风险资产出现一场血洗。所以我认为这就是过去24小时发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's the syllogism about the Bitcoin sell-off? If Japan yields rise, the yen appreciates against the dollar. When the yen appreciates against the dollar, people have to sell their uh yen or sell sorry, sell their tech stocks or whatever other asset they're in. Most of the types of assets that immediately get sold off are crypto assets because those are the most liquid at that moment because they trade 24 hours. that ends up being Bitcoin to cover the short on their yen because again there's a very convenient yen carry trade that I think people know about by now which is shorting the yen borrowing in yen and then going long tech or going long crypto or going long something risky when the chickens compose come home to roost for a trade like that it ends up leading to a blood bath in the US markets at least from a risk-on perspective and so I think that is what happened over the past 24 hours</p>
</details>

此外，还有很多关于去杠杆化的报告。在比特币市场或加密市场中，已经发生了8亿美元的去杠杆。没人确切知道为什么会出现如此大规模的去杠杆效应。当然，有人可能会说这是日元套利交易，但也可能是别的原因。也许不仅仅是日元套利交易，背后可能有不同的宏观论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you've also got a lot of reports of just deleveraging so there's $800 million ion dollars of deleveraging that has happened uh in the Bitcoin markets now or in the crypto markets. No one knows exactly why there's been so much of a deleveraging effect. Again, one could argue it is the yen carry trade, but maybe it's something else. Maybe maybe it's not just uh yen yen carry trade. Maybe there's a different macro thesis going on for why</p>
</details>

如果你看一下，XRP、Solana，Solana在127美元，比特币86,000美元，以太坊不幸地无法维持在3000美元以上的任何势头。今早有8亿美元的清算。你可能会认为，在10月10日那次导致200亿美元清算的杠杆事件之后，以及11月的又一次之后，系统中的杠杆应该不会那么多了。但看起来杠杆依然存在，而且人们似乎还在继续加杠杆。所以不幸的是，这可能是加密货币领域的另一个问题，那就是系统中还有大量杠杆没有被清除。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean if you take a look at it XRP Salana Salana's at 127 Bitcoin 86,000 Ethereum unfortunately is not able to maintain any momentum above 3,000 800 million as of this morning in liquidations. You would think after all the leverage that that happened on October 10th which led to that $20 billion liquidation and then again in November that there wouldn't be as much leverage in the system. It looks like there is and it looks like people continue to to leverage up. So unfortunately this might be another issue with what's going on in crypto which is that there's just a lot more leverage that is not wiped out of the system yet.</p>
</details>

我知道这是个坏消息，人们不想听到这个，因为过去一个半月他们一直在听说杠杆太多，保证金太多，但坦率地说，系统中可能真的有太多太多的保证金了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know that's a terrible or that's an people don't want to hear that because you know they they've heard for the past month and a half that there's leverage there's too much margin but quite frankly there might just be way too much freaking margin in the system.</p>
</details>

这就引出了关于Saylor的问题。现在，Saylor，我不太清楚他今天到底宣布了什么，对我来说仍然不完全明朗，但他宣布了一个14.4亿美元的储备金，我猜这只是一个装有十亿美元的储备。然后他们又买了一点比特币。我没时间去完全分析今天到底发生了什么，但他们又买了130个比特币，价格是89,960美元。他们现在拥有65万个比特币。顺便说一下，他们在8K文件中更新了对比特币的预测。他们不再认为年底会达到15万美元，现在他们假设是85,000美元。所以，他们的很多预测都下调了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this brings up the question of Sailor. Now, Sailor, I don't know exactly what he announced today. It still doesn't fully make sense to me, but he announced a 1.44 billion USD reserve, which I guess that's just a reserve filled with a billion dollars. And then they bought a little bit more Bitcoin. I didn't get time to fully analyze what exactly happened today, but they bought another 130 Bitcoin, 89, 960. They now have 650,000 Bitcoin. By the way, they updated in their 8K their projections for Bitcoin. They don't think it's going to 150,000 anymore by the end of the year. They're now assuming 85,000. So, a lot of their projections came down,</p>
</details>

但是Saylor继续在买入，很多人都在问一个问题，等等，考虑到MicroStrategy的债务义务，它会不会成为地球上负债最严重的资产之一？如果我没记错的话，他们每年需要为所有优先股和其他发行的股权支付约7.3亿美元的利息。当比特币上涨时，这一切都行得通。当比特币不涨时，这就成了问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but uh Sailor continues to buy and you got a lot of people asking a question, wait a second, could Micro Strategy become one of the most distressed assets on the planet in terms of debt just given the amount of obligations they have? They have about, if I'm not wrong, $730 million per year in interest that they have to pay on all their preferred and all the other types of equities they put out. Um, and a lot of that works when Bitcoin's going up. When Bitcoin is not going up, that becomes an issue.</p>
</details>

当然，如果你听Saylor的说法，他的观点是他们有大量的资金，或者说有大量的杠杆来偿还债务。如果你仔细阅读他们发行的优先股条款，会发现很多条款允许他们发行更多股票来偿还债权人，而不是给他们现金。在他们的许多文件中，出售比特币是最后的手段。这是一种可能性，但考虑到Saylor对比特币的承诺，这似乎不太可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, if you listen to Sailor, his perspective is they have tons and tons of money or not tons of money, they have tons of leverage to be able to pay off their debt. And a lot of the clauses, if you actually read through the preferred equities they put out, allow them to issue more stock to be able to pay off the creditors instead of having them giving them cash and selling their Bitcoin is kind of the last resort uh in in a lot of their filings. That it is a possibility, but you know, given Sailor's commitment to Bitcoin, it feels rather unlikely.</p>
</details>

所以，有很多不同的说法在发酵，但我认为日元套利交易是比特币受挫的核心原因，结果导致英伟达下跌1.2%。我们稍后会谈到英伟达。周末有很多关于英伟达的不同消息，很多关于其竞争格局的新报告。所以我们会讨论一下。但显然，谷歌、英伟达、博通、Palantir、Hood、特斯拉，所有这些公司都随着比特币从91,000美元跌至85,000美元而受到冲击。VIX指数也在上涨，盘前大约上涨了7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you got a lot of different narratives boiling up, but I think that yen carry trade is kind of the core reason why Bitcoin's getting hit and as a result that took down Nvidia down 1.2%. We'll talk about Nvidia. You had a lot of different things over the weekend about Nvidia, a lot of new reports about what's going on with Nvidia from a competitive perspective. So we'll talk about that. But obviously Google, Nvidia, Broadcom Pounder Hood, Tesla, all of them getting hit as Bitcoin takes a uh takes a bit of a dip from 91,000 to 85,000 here on the day. VIX is up as well, up about I think what 7% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

### Tom Lee 的乐观看法：量化紧缩结束与市场季节性顺风
好的，Tom Lee 刚刚上节目了。让我们看看他今天早上说了些什么，然后我们再来谈谈英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, around about 7%. Okay, Tom Lee was just on. Let's take a look at what he had to say this morning as well and then we will get into Nvidia</p>
</details>

> **Tom Lee:** 未来几周的焦点将围绕中央银行。美联储预计将在12月降息，而且今天也是**量化紧缩**（Quantitative Tightening, QT: 指中央银行减少其资产负债表规模，从而减少货币供应量的过程）结束的日子。如你所知，美联储自2022年4月以来一直在缩减其资产负债表，这对市场流动性构成了相当大的阻力。上一次我们结束QT是在2019年9月。如果你回顾那个时期，市场反应非常好。我认为在3周内，市场上涨了超过17%。所以我确实认为，QT结束的时机——现在基本上意味着QE（量化宽松）的开始——以及美联储的行动，恰逢11月市场动荡。所以我认为人们变得谨慎，但现在不得不追逐业绩，而且通常还有一个季节性的顺风。因此，即使第一天可能有些颠簸，我仍然对12月的前景相当看好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> in the next couple of weeks is around central bank. The Fed is set to cut uh in December, but also today is the day that quantitative tightening ends. And as you know, the Fed's been shrinking its balance sheet since April 2022. It's been a pretty big headwind for market liquidity. The last time we had an end to QT, quantitative tightening, was September 2019. And if you look back at that period, the markets really responded well. I think within 3 weeks, rallied more than 17%. So I do think the timing of QT ending which is now essentially QE starting >> and the Fed and at a time when November kind of was topsyturvy. So I think people got cautious but now have to performance chase and then you have a a really typically a seasonal tailwind. So I I'm pretty bullish into December even with maybe the first day being rocky.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 是的。所以，关键仍然在于美联储。因为我曾想过，市场可能会达到一个拐点，即美联储降息的原因本身会成为市场的问题。我之前对就业和其他所有事情都是这么想的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yep. Um, so it's still all about the Fed because I was thinking there there is a time when a market can hit an inflection point where the reason the Fed is cutting um becomes a problem for the markets. That's what I thought with the jobs and everything else. it there might</p>
</details>

> **Tom Lee:** 我想说，政府关门导致数据出现“黑洞”，我认为这造成了一些焦虑，因为市场喜欢确定性。但对我来说，失业救济申请数据一直表现良好，而且9月份的就业报告显示出一些复苏迹象。我认为劳动力市场可能保持得不错，但美联储不希望情况恶化。不过我认为通胀的故事实际上已经减弱了很多。所以对我来说，美联储降息是出于正确的原因，那就是当他们展望未来12个月时，关税对通胀的影响正在消退，但就业市场存在风险。所以我认为这是出于正确原因的降息，因为如果不降息，实际利率就会收紧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> uh I mean I'd say that the shutdown put a blackout on data and I think that created a bit of anxiety because you know markets like visibility but to me the fact that claims have been behaving and that this the the September jobs report kind of showed a a bit of a recovery. I think the labor market's probably holding fine but the Fed doesn't want that to worsen but I think the inflation story is actually weakened a lot. So to me the the Fed would be cutting for the right reasons which is as they look at the next 12 months the tariff inflation impacts are fading but there's risk on the job market. So I mean I think it's cutting for the right reason which is you know real rates are tightening if they don't cut.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** Tom，几周前市场的行为让我感到担忧的是，我看到所有AI领域的明星股都出现了相当急剧的下跌，因为当时看起来美联储不打算降息了。这引发了关于私募市场正在发生什么的疑问。我开始思考，好吧，我们是不是在看很多商业模式，如果美联储不继续降息，它们就无法运作？这些商业模式是否正是当前推动市场上涨的动力？这是让我警觉并说“嗯，这有点不一样”的一件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here here's what concerned me about a couple of weeks ago, Tom, with the market's behavior, and that was watching all of the AI high-f flyers dip and drop pretty precipitously in some cases because it looked like the Fed wasn't going to cut. That raised questions about what was happening in the private markets. And it made me start to wonder, okay, are we looking at a lot of business models that don't work if the Fed doesn't continue to cut rates? are are these and are these the business models that are are driving empowering the market right now? That that that's the one thing that made me sit up and say, "Huh, that's a little different."</p>
</details>

> **Tom Lee:** 是的。我认为11月份确实有很多反思，因为我们知道杠杆率上升了。我们也知道在一些市场，比如加密货币市场，出现了去杠杆化，而且保证金债务很高。我认为11月份基本上进行了一次重置，因为市场下跌了6%，但AI股票、meme股票和许多其他股票跌得更多。所以我认为这次头寸重置是健康的。而且我认为，我们在11月中旬与之交谈的许多基金经理，在那种情况下都放弃了，认为今年剩下的时间基本上是报废了。而现在，如果12月表现强劲，就会出现一些业绩追逐。我认为这正是你在一年最后几周通常应该预期的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I I think there was a lot a bit of soularching, Becky, in November because we know leverage rose. Um and we know there was deleveraging in in some markets like crypto and we know margin debts high. And I think that there was essentially a reset in November because, you know, the market had a 6% decline, but the AI stocks and the meme names and a lot of other names fell even more. So I I think that that position reset has been healthy. And I think many fund managers we talked to in November in the midst of all that kind of threw in the towel, thought the year, rest of the year was sort of a write-off. And and now if December is strong, there's going to be a a bit of a performance chasing. And I I think that's what you should typically expect in the final weeks of the year.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 我认为，当我们看到比特币和那些高飞的股票因为鲍威尔在某次会议上表现鹰派而抛售时，然后威廉姆斯完全扭转了局面，美联储期货跳涨，很明显他们肯定会再次降息，但我们从中得到的回报却很少。如果比特币真的完全依赖于美联储的宽松政策，它现在应该回到10万美元了。如果这是一个人们所说的贬值交易，我们现在并没有得到太多回报。现在大家都确定他们会降息。之前有一段时间我们以为他们不会降息。回到降息模式，我们得到了什么？

<p class="english-text">I thought it was um when we saw Bitcoin sell off and sort of the the high-f flyier selloff on the notion that Pal got hawkish at that one whatever it was that one meeting and then Williams totally turned that around and and the Fed futures jumped and it became clear they're definitely cutting again and we got very little for that uh with Bitcoin should be back at 100 if it really is totally dependent on uh Fed easing and and if if it's a debasement trade, which people say it is, we didn't get much for now. Everybody you're sure that they're going to cut. Now, there was a time where we thought they weren't going to cut. What do we get for going back to cutting mode?</p>

> **Tom Lee:** 是的，比特币和加密货币一直令人失望，因为它们在10月中旬受到了重创，然后当美联储降息的概率下降时又再次受挫。你说得对，比特币下跌了，而现在降息的概率已经恢复，但它们还没有完全恢复。我认为这仍然是10月10日那次去杠杆化的后遗症。这与2022年FTX事件造成的崩盘没什么不同，那次花了八周时间。所以我们正在从那次事件中恢复过来。现在已经过去七周了。所以，也许再过一两周，我认为加密市场就完全出清了，那时候它才会开始参与上涨。

<p class="english-text">Uh yeah, I mean uh Bitcoin and crypto have been disappointing because they really took it in the gut in midocctober and then kind of got hit again when you're right when the odds of a Fed cut dropped um Bitcoin fell and then now that the odds have recovered of a cut they haven't quite recovered. >> I mean I think that that's still the lingering effects of that deleveraging that happened on October 10th. It's not that different than the wipeout that happened in 2022 with FTX that took eight weeks. So, we're kind of emerging from that. We're now that's seven weeks in the rearview mirror. So, maybe in another week or two, I think crypto has fully washed out and that's when it starts to participate.</p>

### Nvidia 面临新挑战：谷歌 TPU 的竞争威胁
Tom 基本上在这里提出了一个论点，即我们在加密货币领域正在转向避险。他几周前也提出了同样的去杠杆论点。除非情况改变，否则加密货币似乎可能会停滞一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um you got Tom basically making the argument right here that we're going risk off on crypto. The same sort of deleveraging argument he made a couple weeks ago. And unless that changes then it does seem like crypto is probably going to be stalled out for a bit.</p>
</details>

Tom 仍然预测标普500指数会达到7200点，或者至少是7000点。这离我们只有2.5%的距离，并不算太疯狂。我们在周三收于683点。我知道当时成交量很低，所以现在随着我们进入12月的第一个交易周，市场将迎来全量交易，但一个月上涨2.5%并非不可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, Tom's still calling for 7200o um on the S&P 500. Obviously, it does or at least 7,000, right? It's two and a half% away. It's not that crazy. We ended at 683 on uh Wednesday. I know there was low volume, so now we're going to have full volume come into the markets as we approach the first trading week of December, but it it's not crazy to think we have a 2 and a half% month.</p>
</details>

现在，要达到这个目标有一些障碍。过去几周最大的障碍之一是关于我们是否会降息的明确性。我的意思是，概率是自上周我们得到美联储主席戴利和威廉姆斯暗示我们将可能降息以来最高的。美联储期货概率显示有87.6%的可能性。所以，如果我们继续得到市场对降息的预期，我不认为这是看跌的。这是否意味着我们会大涨？不一定。但这确实意味着我们有可能不会轻易下跌，或者底部不会像11月那样崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there are some hurdles to get there. One of the biggest hurdles over the past couple weeks was clarity around if we're going to get rate cuts. I mean, probabilities are the highest they've been even since all of last week when we got the nod from Fed President Dally and Fed President um Williams that we're going to be likely to cut. I mean, 87.6% on the Fed futures probability. So, if we're going to continue to get the market expectation that a rate cut is happening, I don't see that as bearish. Does that mean we're going to pump? Not necessarily. But it does mean there is a chance we don't easily dump or the bottom doesn't fall out like it was happening in November.</p>
</details>

而且你知道，11月最终只是小幅下跌。我们最高达到689点，周三收于683点。我知道现在我们下跌了大约半个百分点。但尽管周三很疯狂，那并不是一个我们最终下跌了四五个百分点的月份。事实上，那是自1950年以来标普500指数在11月份最大的逆转。我们下跌了4.5%，然后通过回升3.5%收复了其中的75%。所以，我们结束11月的方式相当不可思议。问题只是，这是否会在12月重演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, November ended barely down. We peaked at 689. We ended Wednesday at 683. I know right now we're down about half a percent. But as as crazy as Wednesday was, it was not uh one of those months where we actually ended, you know, four or five% down. In fact, it was the largest reversal in November's history since 1950 on the S&P 500. um we lost four and a half percent and then we recovered 75% of that by regaining three 3.5%. So quite incredible how we ended out November. The question is just will that play out for December.</p>
</details>

现在，一些人对12月持怀疑态度的原因之一是英伟达。所以让我们来谈谈这个话题。英伟达目前股价174.99美元，下跌约1.15%。周三它下跌了1.8%。所以实际上，周三当标普500指数收盘时，虽然不是历史新高，但接近历史新高，英伟达不幸未能收高。它是周三唯一收红的股票之一，我觉得这很奇怪。为什么在整个市场都在上涨的时候，英伟达却是红色的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now one of the reasons some people are skeptical for December is because of Nvidia. So let's get into that topic. Nvidia right here 174.99 down about 1.15%. It was down 1.8% on Wednesday. So actually on Wednesday when the S&P closed uh not at all-time highs but close to all-time highs, Nvidia unfortunately was not able to close higher. It was one of the only stocks that was red on Wednesday, which I thought was pretty peculiar. Like, why is Nvidia red when the entire market is pumping?</p>
</details>

我认为这是健康的，因为英伟达下跌但市场上涨，意味着有其他东西在支撑标普500指数，这是好事。谷歌、苹果，以及一系列不同的公司，比如医疗保健，都开始发挥作用。但英伟达到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's healthy because Nvidia going red, but the market pumping means that there's other things that are propping up the S&P 500, which is good.

SemiAnalysis，一家半导体咨询公司，很多人可能认识Dylan Patel，他是该精品咨询公司的创始人和思想领袖。他们发布了一份报告，我还没有完全读完，大概有1万字。我周末没做这件事。我计划深入分析他们所说的内容。但他发布的这张图总结了整个报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Semi analysis, which is a consulting firm for semiconductors. A lot of people probably know Dylan Patel. He is a uh thought leader and he's the founder of that boutique consulting firm. They put out a report and that report I have not fully read the report. It's like 10,000 words. I did not do that over the weekend. Uh I am planning to try to get deeper into analyzing what they're saying. But this graphic is what he posted which summarizes the entire report.</p>
</details>

正如你从图中所看到的，基本上是说谷歌的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌为机器学习专门设计的处理器）正在挑战英伟达的地位。他并不是说英伟达已经死了，也不是说英伟达无法生存。实际上，他非常看好它。我认为人们把他作为半导体分析师的观点描绘得不正确。他绝不是看空英伟达。如果你听过他过去六个月的任何播客，你会发现他对英伟达的发展轨迹非常非常乐观。每个人都知道英伟达是这里的领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as you can see right here from the graphic, it's basically Google TPUs are coming for Nvidia's launch. Now he is not saying Nvidia is dead. He's not saying Nvidia is not going to survive. He's actually incredibly bullish on it. I think people are painting his perspectives uh as a semiconductor analyst in the wrong light. I mean, he he he's by no means bearish on Nvidia. And if you've listened to any of his podcasts over the past like six months, he's very very bullish on their trajectory. Everyone knows Nvidia is the leader here.</p>
</details>

但他的论点是，可能会有一些利润率压缩，也可能会有一些市场份额被夺走。他指出的原因之一是，他看到这些大型语言模型公司早期采用了谷歌的TPU集群。例如，他说OpenAI甚至还没有部署TPU，就已经在整个实验室范围内的英伟达集群上节省了30%的成本。这表明TPU的每总拥有成本（TCO）优势是如此强大，以至于在它们甚至还没开机之前，你就已经从采用TPU中获得了收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But his argument is there might be a little bit of margin compression and there might be a little bit of market share that is being taken away. And one of the reasons he points to that is because of the early adoption that he's seeing in these LLM companies with Google's TPU fleet. So for example, he said OpenAI hasn't even deployed TPUs yet and they've already saved 30% on their entire labwide Nvidia fleet. This demonstrates how the perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs before they even turn on.</p>
</details>

谷歌的TPU，即张量处理单元，是另一种形式的**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 为特定用途设计的集成电路）。网上有很多关于这些TPU的能源效率以及它们至少能与Blackwell（英伟达的GPU架构）相媲美，甚至在特定用例中表现同样出色的争论。这可能不是通用用例，这也是黄仁勋反驳ASIC论点的地方。因此，这对谷歌来说是一个巨大的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A TPU tensor tensor processing unit from Google once again is another form of ASIC. And there are a lot of debates online going on around the energy efficiency of these TPUs and the ability for them to be at least somewhat on par with Blackwell if not quite frankly just as good in a specific use case, maybe not a general purpose use case, which is where, you know, Jensen's kind of retorts the ASIC argument comes in. And as a result, it's a massive opportunity for Google.</p>
</details>

已经有很多投资公司，比如摩根士丹利、摩根大通、高盛，在周末发表声明说：“嘿，我们不认为英伟达会倒下。”但如果谷歌能占据这个市场哪怕3%到4%的份额，我们谈论的将是未来几年其盈利和收入潜力的巨大增长。这就是为什么我认为谷歌能守住现在300美元这个价位的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've already had a bunch of investment firms like in like Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs. They came out over the weekend. They said, "Hey, we don't think Nvidia is going anywhere." But if Google were to take even three to 4% of this market, we're talking about massive upside to their earnings and revenue potential over the coming years, which is why I think Google is holding this $300 level that it's staying at right now.</p>
</details>

看，我正在努力对TPU做更多的研究，试图从根本上理解它们，但在我看来，我并不认为英伟达已经死了。我认为英伟达非常有吸引力。如果股价回到170美元以下，我会买入更多。我认为一年后，我们会嘲笑那些因为Michael Burry的Substack文章或谷歌TPU而认为英伟达会完蛋的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, I'm trying to do more research on the TPUs. I'm trying to understand them at at a fundamental level, but at its core, I do not think Nvidia is dead. I think Nvidia is very attractive. If I bought more Nvidia at 170, if we go back below 170, I will be buying more. I think in a year we will be laughing at the idea that Nvidia was supposed to die because of Michael Burry substack or because of Google TPUs.</p>
</details>

归根结底，如果你相信对AI和计算的需求是永无止境的，你就必须看好英伟达。就这么简单。因为如果需求不是永无止境的，即使谷歌开始销售一些TPU，是的，他们会赚一些钱，但该业务线的盈利可持续性，即他们持续销售TPU的能力，将不复存在。同样的情况也适用于AMD。显然，所有的CoreWeaves、Nebula、Iren这些公司都会出局。你要么相信需求存在，要么不信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the day, if you believe demand is insatiable for AI and compute, you have to be bullish Nvidia. It's just that simple. Because if demand is not insatiable, even if Google starts selling some TPUs, yeah, they'll make some money, but the sustainability of the earnings of that business line of them like consistently selling TPUs is not going to exist. Same thing for AMD. Obviously, all the Core Weaves, Neb, I ren those go out the window. Like, you either believe the demand is there or you don't.</p>
</details>

如果你相信需求存在，那么拥有供应链、基础设施、生态系统以及实际谈判能力以获得现有利润率的公司就是英伟达。我不是说那种垄断或准垄断会永远存在。但我想说的是，鉴于我们过去一年看到的计算和能源限制，以及基于黄仁勋从第三季度到第四季度的指引，现在英伟达的交易价格是2026年企业价值倍数（EV/EBITDA）的20倍，市盈率（EPS）的25倍。在我看来，这简直是明摆着的好买卖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you believe the demand is there, then the company with the supply chain, with the infrastructure, with the ecosystem, with the ability to actually negotiate the deals that allow them to have the margins that they have is Nvidia. Not saying th that that monopoly or that pseudo monopoly is going to exist forever. But I am saying given the level of compute constraints we've seen and energy constraints we've seen over the past year and and based on just Jensen's guidance for from uh Q3 going into Q4 and now Nvidia is trading at a 20 times EBID of value with a 25 times EPS for 2026. It just seems like a no-brainer in my opinion.</p>

### 马斯克看好谷歌与 Nvidia 的未来价值

埃隆说，很难想象谷歌在这里不会成为赢家。我认为谷歌已经展示的大量证据，尤其是Gemini 3，已经极大地吸引了埃隆的注意力。要知道，埃隆在很多方面都与谷歌竞争，他能说出“是的，这些家伙正在为真正的胜利奠定基础”，我认为这很重要。然后，他说英伟达是“显而易见的”。所以，Sundar、埃隆，还有周三那位谷歌DeepMind的研究员发推文说英伟达的抛售是愚蠢的。我确实不认为英伟达的投资逻辑存在根本性问题。

### 宏观经济观察：强劲的“黑五”消费与美联储降息预期
美国银行调整了我们的预测，预计12月将降息25个基点，终端利率保持不变。他们相信我们会得到这次降息。美国银行最初并不认为我们会降息，但他们改变了主意。为什么他们改变了主意？嗯，现在看来很明显，我们将得到这次美联储降息，因为美联储主席威廉姆斯和主席多莉已经暗示我们将降息。因此，一些大银行很难继续想象这次降息不会发生。

Bank of America originally did not think we were going to get this rate cut and they've changed their mind. Why did they change their mind? Well, it seems kind of obvious now that we are going to get this Fed rate cut as Fed President Williams and Fed President Dolly have signified that we're going to get a rate cut. And as a result, it's hard for some of these big banks to continue to imagine that this rate cut is not going to happen.</p>

除此之外，我们还经历了一个非常成功的黑色星期五。Shopify的首席执行官Toby Luke也说了以下这番话：商家的黑色星期五总销售额为62亿美元，同比增长25%。边缘计算的峰值请求达到了每分钟4.89亿次，这有点疯狂。应用服务器处理的峰值请求为每分钟1.17亿次。数据库的峰值查询达到了每秒超过5300万次，API在其峰值时每分钟处理超过3100万个请求。所以Shopify经历了一个非常大规模的黑色星期五，同比增长25%。他们每年都以大约20%到25%的速度复合增长，再次表明消费者可能并不像我们想象的那么疲软。

<p class="english-text">On top of that, you had a really successful Black Friday. Here's what Toby Luke, the CEO of Shopify, had to say as well.

App servers handled a peak of 117 million requests per minute. the peak database queries reached over 53 million per second and 2 million uh were reached as well over a second from the queries on the database and the API uh process over 31 million requests per minute at their peak. So Shopify had a massive massive Black Friday 25% year-over-year. Every year they've been compounding at around 20 to 25% showing again maybe the consumer isn't as weak as we think.</p>

Adobe Analytics表示，美国在线黑色星期五销售额达到创纪录的118.8亿美元，同比增长9%，预计周六将再增加50亿美元，周日60亿美元，而今天是网络星期一，预计销售额将达到142亿美元。Salesforce预计黑色星期五的消费总额将达到约180亿美元，同比增长3%。所以，如果我们认为消费者状况良好，并且我们认为将会降息，你就可以理解为什么美国银行会说：“好吧，我们必须调整我们对今年剩余时间将如何发展的预测”，以及为什么许多这些公司继续维持7000到7500美元的目标价，因为宏观环境确实有可能朝着有利于多头的方向发展。

So look, if we think the consumer is okay and we think we're getting rate cuts, you can understand why Bank of America is saying, "All right, we have to kind of tweak our call on how we think the rest of the year is going to end up playing out and why a lot of these firms continue to have this like $7,000 to $7,500 target because there just might be a chance for the macro to tune in in the favor of the bulls."</p>

> **Jensen Huang:** 当然。如果你看看我们今天在做的事情，我们与Synopsis合作了很长时间。英伟达是建立在Synopsis以及当然还有像Cadence、Siemens和Dassault等许多其他公司的设计工具基础之上的。这些是非常重要的公司，整个工程行业都建立在它们之上。由于我们今天能够做到的事情，我们能够将GPU加速计算，即英伟达的CUDA，首次带入世界工业领域。这是物理AI，是遵守物理定律的AI，是与物理世界互动的AI。这是极其复杂的东西。我们花了很多年才能够做到这一点。现在如果你看看世界的工业部门，它的规模是以万亿美元计的。所以对于英伟达、Synopsis以及整个行业来说，这是一个巨大的机会扩展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. If you look at what we're doing today, if you look, we've been partnering with Synopsis for a very long time. You NVIDIA was built on a foundation of design tools from Synopsis and of course many other companies like Cadence and and uh uh Seammens and Dau. These are very important companies that the entire engineering industry is built on top of as a result of what we're able to do today. We're able to bring GPU accelerated computing, Nvidia's CUDA into the world's industrial sector for the very first time. This is this is uh physics, physical AI. This is AI that obeys the laws of physics that AI that interacts with the physical world. This is extremely complex stuff. It's taken us years to be able to do this. And now if you look at the world's industrial sector, it's measured in trillions of dollars. So for both Nvidia and Synopsis and the entire industry, this is a giant expansion of opportunity.</p>

I I'm thinking about Vera Rubin. I had to go read that Richard Feman book because you mentioned he's a pretty funny guy.

Accelerating synopsis design tools, the EDA, the SDA, the CAE tools requires a computer architecture like CUDA. It's not available for AS6. And so NVIDIA can address markets that are much much broader, not just chatbots. We are also everywhere. We're in every cloud. We're in every single OEM. We're on prem and we're also at the edge. And so the NVIDIA opportunity is much much larger. And you're now seeing a real tangible experience example of an opportunity that we could do with our platform that nobody else can.

### 市场开盘动态与宏观数据解读
好吧，这就是黄仁勋回答谷歌问题的方式。这是他对谷歌事件的首次公开回应。正如Julie所说，黄仁勋从不恶语相向，总是非常尊重、友善。他懂得如何非常圆滑地处理事情。我认为他的回应是相当合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I was just all right. That's how Jensen answered the Google question. And this was his first public response to what's been going on with Google. As Julie says right there, Jensen never trashtalking, always pretty respectful, nice. He understands how to handle things very diplomatically. And uh I think his response is is pretty reasonable right there.</p>
</details>

他回应的前奏是他对原型制作中数字模拟的总可寻址市场（TAM）的解释。这是他在财报电话会议上谈到过的事情，但我没有想太多。这些在现实世界中创造实体产品的公司，在原型制作上花费数十亿美元，以及创建这些原型所需的数据。如果你能通过Omniverse和Cosmos平台合成地创建这些原型，或者至少在这些合成数据上进行训练——这就是他们帮助Synopsis在CUDA架构层面进行设计所做的事情——这再次证明了CUDA作为跨所有OEM、所有本地或云计算模块的首选开发者应用的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the sort of precursor to his response was the explanation he gave around the TAM of digital simulations on prototyping. That that's an you know that's something he talked about on the earnings call, but I haven't thought about it too much. These companies that are in the real world creating physical products spend billions of dollars on prototyping and the data required to be able to create those prototypes. if you could synthetically create those or at least train on that synthetic data via the Omniverse and Cosmos platform which is what they're helping Synopsis do in terms of designing that uh from a CUDA architecture perspective which again Jensen goes you know pretty deep every single quarter speaking about why CUDA is the developer application of choice across every single OEM every single on-prem or cloud computing module</p>
</details>

我的意思是，那是一道护城河，一道合法的护城河，不仅仅是他们在硬件上的垄断，而这种垄断正随着这些ASIC的出现而被削弱。但那些ASIC没有CUDA基础设施，无法将生态系统整合到一个地方。据我了解，要使用谷歌TPU，你必须使用谷歌云，这可能不适合世界上所有的客户。但话又说回来，这就是ASIC的特点，这也是为什么黄仁勋一直如此看好GPU相对于GPU的变体，如TPU或任何其他类型的变体。所以我认为他说的很有道理。

<p class="english-text">I mean that is a moat right like that is a legitimate moat outside of just their their monopoly on on the hardware that you know is getting chipped away as you have these AS6 come out but those AS6 don't have that CUDA infrastructure that actually integrates the ecosystem in one place I mean to get on Google TPUs from my understanding you have to be using Google cloud and that might not be suitable to every single customer in the world but then again that's the characteristic of an ASIC which is why Jensen has been so bullish on the sort of GPU versus the variation of the GPU like a TPU or any other type of variation so I think it makes a lot of sense what he's saying right there</p>

### 比特币周期之辩与未来展望
我确实看了Andre的视频。Andre的视频从技术分析的角度提出了一个非常有趣的观点，你可以讨厌技术分析，也可以喜欢它，但他的论点是，比特币的上涨和下跌有特定的天数。因此，距离下一个高峰还有365天。

<p class="english-text">Did you watch Andre's video on it? Yes, I actually did watch Andre's video. So, Andre's video actually has a really interesting point from a technical analysis perspective, and you can either hate technical analysis or love TA, but um his argument was that like there's a specific amount of days for Bitcoin to go up and down. And as a result, you have 365 days until the next peak.</p>
</details>

> **Andre Jikh (视频片段):** 历史模式显示比特币的下跌周期为50天。但更有趣的是，上一个周期，即第三和第四周期，也花费了完全相同的时间，大约1050天。现在，看看这个。我知道这看起来很复杂，但这张图表显示了同样的事情。比特币遵循着相同的模式，但从历史最低点到历史最高点，再从历史最高点到历史最低点交替进行。例如，在2015年，从历史最低点到历史最高点，比特币花了大约1050天。然后在2017年，从历史最高点到历史最低点，比特币花了大约一年，364天。然后在2018年，从历史最低点到历史最高点，又花了1050天左右。再次，从2021年的历史最高点到历史最低点，花了364天。那么，猜猜我们在这个周期从历史最低点到历史最高点花了多长时间？150到1064天左右。这意味着如果这个模式继续下去，我们应该在距离我们历史最高点364天后达到历史最低点，而这个最高点发生在今年的10月6日。这意味着大约在2026年10月5日，比特币可能会达到这个周期的历史最低点。

<p class="english-text">He's looking at the historical patterns on how Bitcoin has sold off, 50 days for this cycle. But what's also very interesting is that the last cycles, cycles three and four, also took the exact same amount, 1,50ish days. Now, check this out. I know it looks complicated, but this chart shows kind of the same thing. Bitcoins followed the same pattern, but alternating from the all-time low to the all-time high and then all-time high to the all-time low. So, for example, in 2015, from the all-time low to the all-time high, it took Bitcoin 1,50ish days. And then in 2017, from the all-time high to the all-time low, it took Bitcoin about a year, 364 days. Then in 2018, from the all-time low to the all-time high, it took again 1,50ish days. And again, from the all-time high in 2021 to the all-time low, it took 364 days. Well, guess how long it took us to go from the all-time low to the all-time high in this cycle? 150 to 1,64-ish days. Which means if this pattern continues, we should reach the all-time low 364 days from our all-time high, which happened on October 6th of this year. That means we are on around October 5th, 2026 when Bitcoin could reach the all-time low of this cycle.</p>

我的意思是，不管你喜不喜欢，这是一个非常简单的解释。你不必同意它，但一个三年级的学生都能理解这个解释。他只是在看以前的周期，从低点到高点，再从高点到低点，然后 буквально复制这些数字。

<p class="english-text">I mean, hate it or love it, it's a pretty simple explanation. You don't have to agree with it, but like a third grader could understand that explanation. He's just looking at the previous cycles from now or from lows to highs and then from highs to lows and literally just copying those numbers.</p>

### 日本的人口危机与经济困境
关于日本，有一个没人愿意谈论的更深层次的话题。日本实际上正在经历一场人口危机。传统的说法是日本人的生育率不高。当然，这确实是事实，就像美国人的生育率也不高一样。但真正的问题是，日本并不真正欢迎移民。

<p class="english-text">This is the conversation no one wants to have on Japan. This is the conversation no one wants to have. Japan's actually struggling on a population crisis. Now, the conventional conversation is um people in Japan aren't having that many kids. Sure, that's that's like the legit people in America aren't having that many kids. The actual problem is Japan doesn't really want immigrants.</p>
</details>

事实上，前首相之所以不得不羞愧辞职，是因为他想引进50万尼日利亚和印度人到日本，来从事日本工人阶级不怎么愿意做的工作。部分原因是文化变迁，但另一部分原因是人口老龄化。让一个75岁的人从事体力劳动并不容易。然而，日本民众完全拒绝了这一提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, the reason the old prime minister had to resign out of shame is because he wanted to bring in 500,000 Nigerians and Indians into Japan to be able to do a lot of the work that the working class of Japan isn't really doing. Partly because of uh cultural shifts, but also partly because they're getting older. It's not easy for someone who's 75 years old to do manual labor. And then, you know, the Japanese population rejected that wholeheartedly.</p>
</details>

所以问题是，当日本人口停止指数级增长——这在过去十年已经发生了——并且每个人都变老，无法从事体力劳动时，谁来做这些工作呢？如果你不让其他人进入这个国家。所以，这就像是关于他们经济状况的一个更广泛的哲学问题。与此同时，他们正在印钞和加息，这扰乱了日元套利交易，并影响了我们所有人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So the thing is when Japanese people stop when when the Japanese population starts growing stops growing at an exponential pace which it's already been for the past 10 years and everyone gets old and can't do manual labor who's going to do the work like if you're not going to have other people come into the country. So it's like that's the broader philosophical question on what's going on with their economy. And in the meantime they're printing money and raising rates and that's messing up the yen carry trade and that's affecting all of us.</p>

### 埃隆·马斯克的未来预测：AI、机器人技术与通货紧缩
> **Elon Musk:** 你必须让生产力提高，让商品和服务的增长速度超过货币供应的增长速度。美国正在大幅增加货币供应，赤字大约在2万亿美元的量级。所以，你必须让商品和服务的产出增长超过这个数字，才能避免通货膨胀。我们还没到那一步。但如果你问，我们需要多长时间才能达到？我猜大概是3年。在3年或更短的时间内，我的猜测是，商品和服务的产出增长将超过货币供应的增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Productivity to increase the goods and services faster than the increase in the money supply. So incre the US is increasing money supply quite substantially with you know deficits that are on the order of $2 trillion. >> Yeah. Uh so so you have to have um you know goods and services output increase more than that in order to not have inflation. So we're not there yet. But if you say like like how long would it take us to get there? I think it's 3 years probably 3 years before in 3 years or less my my guess is goods and services output will exceed the rate of inflation like money</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 也许在那三年之后，你会面临通货紧缩，然后利率降至零，那么债务问题就会比现在小。

<p class="english-text">>> Maybe after those three years, you have deflation and then interest rates go to zero and then the debt is a smaller problem than it is.</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yes. >> Right. >> That's most likely the case.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，老兄，我不知道情况是否会这样发展。我对此持怀疑态度，即在三年内会发生这种情况，但如果真的发生了，想象一下，首先，特斯拉的股价会发生什么？因为，你知道，埃隆之所以这么说，部分原因是他认为特斯拉将在输出所有商品和服务方面做出重大贡献。在这种情况下，机器人可能是创造通货紧缩的最大输出来源。但如果情况如此，三年后股市应该比今天高得多，因为大部分增长将归结为企业盈利。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean, again, dude, I I don't know if that's how it's going to play out. I I'm pretty skeptical that in three years that happens, but if that does happen in three years, just imagine, first of all, what's going to happen to Tesla's stock price? Because, you know, part of the reason Elon's saying this is because he thinks that Tesla's going to be a major contributor in outputting all the goods and services. In this case, robots is probably going to be the biggest output to uh create that deflation. But like the stock market should be much higher than it is today in three years if that's how it's going to play out because a lot of that growth is going to come down to corporate earnings.</p>

### AI 时代下的创造力与就业冲击
当机器人和人工智能做所有事情时，人们将如何谋生？我不知道。现在，我也不想听起来非常悲观，认为五年内每个人都会失业。我不认为会发生这种情况，但我们不能忽视我们所看到的所有关于大学毕业生和白领工作开始消失的数据。我不认为人工智能和机器人会做所有事情，但它们会做很多事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Man, how are people going to earn a living when robots and AI do everything? I don't know. Now again, I also don't want to sound super doomeristic and think like everyone's losing their jobs in five years. Like I I don't think that's happening, but we can't ignore all the data that we've been seeing about college grads and white collar jobs starting to go away. I don't think AI and robots are going to do everything, but they're going to do a lot.</p>
</details>

问题是，这是否会开辟一个新的就业市场？但我也对此持怀疑态度，因为互联网开辟了所有这些机会，每个人都说，“哦，人类总能找到办法。”但没有人真正回答人工智能将在创造就业机会方面带来什么。没有人回答这个问题。每个人都只是说，“哦，我们总能找到办法。我们总是创造新的工作。这就是人类进化的方式。”我说，“是的，但互联网，在它出现几年后就很明显，它将使信息民主化，这不可避免地会导致在其之上创建大量需要这些工作的商业模式。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the question is, does that open up a new job market, but I'm also skeptical of that because like the internet opened up all these opportunities and everyone's like, oh, humans always figure it out. But no one's actually answering what is AI going to create in terms of job opportunities. Like no one's answering that question. Everyone's just like, "Oh, we always figure it out. We always make new jobs. Like this is how humans, you know, evolve." I'm like, "Yeah, but the internet, it was quite obvious, even a couple years after the internet, that it would democratize information, which would inevitably lead to massive, massive business models that could be created on top of that that needed those jobs.</p>
</details>

我们从未有过一种东西能取代人类智能到这种程度，它既在使信息民主化，同时也在商品化信息内部的创造力价值，因为例如，一个大型语言模型直接给你答案，或者机器人直接自动化体力劳动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We never had something that was replacing human intelligence to the point where it's democratizing information but it's also commoditizing the value of creativity within the information because a large language model for example just gives you the answer or the robot just automates the the physical labor.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，问题就变成了一个更广泛的哲学论证，即人工智能如何增强工作？当然，Palantir 对此采取了非常明确的方法，正如你在他提供的链接中看到的那样。Karp 已经谈论这个问题很长时间了，即如果你真的相信人工智能，那么就存在一个世界，人工智能可以用来帮助人们，可以成为人类劳动的激励力量，成为人类能动性的激励力量，并且不一定会取代你，而是增强你的自主性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I I think the question then becomes a broader philosophical argument about how does AI enhance jobs? Now again Chad's link right there. Pounder has taken a pretty explicit approach to this as you can see on the link that he has right there which is and Karp has been talking about this for a long time right the idea that hey uh if you actually believe in AI then there is a world where AI can be used to help people and can be a motivating force for human labor motivating force for human agency and also be something that doesn't necessarily replace you but enhances your autonomy</p>
</details>

我认为对此的反驳是，当工厂里有人失业时会发生什么。比如，如果你是一名亚马逊工人，过去五年你一直是，然后他们走过来对你说，“我们不需要你了，因为一个机器人将做你正在做的工作。”我们已经看到了泄露的备忘录。亚马逊已经在讨论如何营销他们的新时代机器人技术，因为他们知道当他们解雇数百万人时，公关会非常糟糕。那些工作会怎样？那些人会怎样？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I I think the push back to that is what happens when someone loses their job in a factory. Like if you're an Amazon worker, you've been an Amazon worker for the past five years and they come up to you and they say, "We don't need you because a robot is going to be doing what you're doing." Which we've seen the leaked memos. Amazon's already been discussing how they're going to market their, you know, new age of robotics because they know the PR is going to be disgusting when they fire millions of people. Like like like what happens to those jobs? What happens to those people?</p>
