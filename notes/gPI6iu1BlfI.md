### 击毙梅乔的重大意义

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 欢迎收听《每日新闻》（The Daily），我是 **Natalie Kitroeff**。当墨西哥军方抓获并击毙该国头号毒枭时，这揭示了总统 **特朗普** 日益增长的压力正如何迫使该国对抗卡特尔。今天，我的同事 **Maria Abi-Habib** 和 **Jack Nicas** 将为我们讲述击毙毒枭 **梅乔**（El Mencho）的行动，以及墨西哥是否有能力赢得这场针对全球最强大犯罪分子的战争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketrof. This is the Daily. When the Mexican military captured and killed the country's top drug lord, it revealed how much President Trump's growing pressure is forcing the country to take on the cartels. Today, my colleagues Maria Abihabib and Jack Nikas on the operation to take down that drug lord, El Mencho, and whether Mexico has what it takes to win a war on some of the most powerful criminals in the world.

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 很高兴能参加节目。我现在正坐在你以前的办公室里，Natalie。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: Maria, Jack, wonderful to have you both on the show. Three Mexico City bureau chiefs. I'm sitting in your old office, Natalie.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 墨西哥击毙**哈利斯科卡特尔**（Jalisco Cartel）首领梅乔的消息非常震撼。我们最近了解到，特朗普政府在其中发挥了重要作用。请为我们说明一下，为什么除掉这一个卡特尔领导人如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: So, we have you here because the news that Mexico had taken out El Mencho, the head of the Halisco cartel, was massive. And we've learned in the days since that the Trump administration played a big part in that. So, level set for us. Why is the takeown of this one cartel leader such a big deal?

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 梅乔可以说是世界上头号犯罪分子，也是全球头号通缉犯。他领导着墨西哥乃至全世界最大的卡特尔。很难夸大这个人物在犯罪世界的地位。墨西哥政府追捕他是一个非常重大的举动，因为他已经逃亡了二十年，在政府内部有很深的关系网。而且，再过四个月**世界杯**就要举行了，发现他的地方距离赛场只有几小时车程。这一举动可能会开启墨西哥暴力冲突的新篇章。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: Well, El Mencho was arguably the single biggest criminal in the world. He was arguably the most wanted man in the world. He led the biggest cartel in Mexico. He led the biggest cartel perhaps in the world. And I know we tend to avoid using superlatives, but it's hard to overstate the importance and significance of this figure in the criminal world. And it's a really big deal that the Mexican government went after him because he had been on the run for two decades. He has ties to government figures around the Mexican government. And this is 4 months just before the World Cup arrives, just a few hours from where he was found. And this is a major move that could open a new chapter of violence in Mexico.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 这对墨西哥政府来说也是一次巨大的考验。他们从未面临过这样的挑战。上一次他们真正尝试打击国内威胁还是在 15 年前，但当时的卡特尔规模远没有这么大，地理覆盖范围和残暴程度也无法与**哈利斯科新一代卡特尔**（CJNG）相比。我们将看到墨西哥安全部队面临前所未有的考验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Yeah. I also think that at this point, this is a huge test for the Mexican government. They have never been tested like this. And the last time they tried to really take on a domestic threat like this was about 15 years ago. But that was a different cartel which was not nearly as big, did not nearly have the geographical reach or the penchant for brutality that Halisco cartel has. So we're going to be seeing Mexico security forces tested in a way that we've never seen before. So let's see what happens.

</details>

### 毒枭梅乔的崛起之路

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 让我们谈谈梅乔。对于很多听众来说，他并不是一个家喻户晓的名字。请告诉我，他是如何成为全球头号通缉犯的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Okay, let's talk about El Mencho, this cartel leader. I think for a lot of listeners, he wasn't a household name. So lay out for me how El Mencho got to be the most wanted man in the world.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 他出生在西部**米却肯州**（Michoacán）的一个贫困家庭。他有五个兄弟，从小种**牛油果**长大。他小学五年级就辍学去田里干活了。到了青少年时期，他开始看守大麻种植园。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Well, he was born into poverty in the state of Mitwakan, which is in the west. He has five brothers. He grew up kind of growing avocados, which is one of the livelihoods of Mituakan. A lot of the avocados that Americans make guacamole from, come from that state. He dropped out of primary school, I think about fifth grade, to work in the fields. And then by the time he was a teenager, he started to guard marijuana plantations apparently.

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 后来他决定移民到加利福尼亚。在 80 年代，他搬到了旧金山湾区，结果重操旧业，被当地警察逮捕。当时他大约 20 岁，随后被驱逐出境。但他非常固执，开始频繁更换姓名并往返于美墨边境。1992 年，他在萨克拉门托因海洛因交易最后一次被捕，服刑三年后再次被驱逐回墨西哥。那时他 30 多岁，竟然加入了当地警察局。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: And then he decided that he wanted to immigrate to California. So he did so in the 1980s. Apparently he said he wanted a better life. So he moves up to San Francisco, the Bay Area, and he ends up falling back into crime, and he gets arrested by the police up there. He's about 20 at this point, and he ends up getting deported. But like the soant that he is, he decides that he's going to start changing names and he starts criss-crossing the US Mexico border. Every time he's arrested, he gets thrown back into Mexico. He comes back. By 1992, he's arrested one last time at this point in Sacramento, California. And he's arrested because he and his brother are carrying out a heroin deal. And he spends 3 years in prison. And so at this point, he's deported again to Mexico and he's in his 30s. And he joins the local police.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 哇，前毒贩变成了警察？这职业转折够狂野的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Wow. Former drug dealer becomes a police officer. Kind of a wild career switch.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 这种情况在墨西哥发生的频率比你想象的要高，因为墨西哥警察系统内部存在严重的**腐败问题**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: You know, it happens more than you would think in Mexico because we have to remember that Mexico has corruption problems specifically within the police.

</details>

### 卡特尔的残暴与扩张

**Jack Nicas**: 梅乔意识到每个人都在受贿，如果不参与其中就是傻瓜。于是他转而加入了**千禧年卡特尔**（Millennial Cartel）。他非常有策略，通过娶首领的女儿来提升自己在组织中的地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: Well, so he kind of realizes that, well, everybody else is on the take and I'd be a sucker not to be on the take. So he switches over and he joins the Millennial Cartel which at this point is very very strong in the country southwest. And strategically he realizes the way to really rise up the ranks of this cartel is to marry one of the leader daughters.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 2008 年到 2009 年间，政府安全部队击毙或逮捕了千禧年卡特尔的许多领导人。这引发了一场极其血腥的权力斗争。梅乔凭借纯粹的暴力和实施最令人作呕、残暴行为的能力脱颖而出。他脱离原组织，成立了独立的**哈利斯科新一代卡特尔**（CJNG）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Yeah. And so he rises through the ranks and then in 2008 and 2009, government security forces end up arresting or killing a bunch of leaders from the Millennial Cartel. Exactly. And it sets off this extremely bloody, brutal leadership fight for who becomes the head honcho of Millennial Cartel. And through sheer brute force and his ability to really embrace some of the most disgusting, gruesome, brutal acts, who rises and ends up being on top? Well, it's El Mencho. and he spins off his forces to form an independent cartel, which is the Kalisco New Generation Cartel.

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 这个新团体的定义特征就是极致的残暴。有报道称，新招募的成员必须通过**同类相食**（cannibalism）来证明自己的忠诚——你必须吃掉一个背叛卡特尔的人。梅乔是这种更具侵略性、更暴力的经营方式的先驱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: And what is the defining feature of this new group he's leading, the Halisco cartel? It's his ability to or want and desire to really just be as brutal as absolutely possible. So for instance, there were reports that his new recruits, he really needed these people to show that they would be as compliant as foot soldiers as they possibly could be and that they were also willing to implement the levels of violence that he himself favored. So for instance, there were reports of cannibalism. you're a recruit and guess what? You've got to eat somebody. Somebody who had betrayed the cartel.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 他还实现了业务多元化。除了毒品，他还涉足牛油果产业、酒店业，甚至诈骗美国和加拿大的老年人，还参与了横跨南美的**非法金矿开采**。他们就像一家业务多元化的**财富 500 强公司**，同时也是一个“准国家行为体”，渗透到了各级政府中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Oh, for sure. He wants the Khalisco cartel to have a finger in every pie. So, avocados, obviously... And then he expands his empire and it becomes more of like a conglomerate. He's not just doing drugs. He's in the hotel industry. They start bilking, you know, senior citizens from the United States to Canada from their time shares. And also, they're now involved in illegal gold mining throughout South America. It gives them resources. It's natural for us to make the analogy that these guys are a Fortune 500 company with a diverse set of businesses. No question. They are also in a way a state actor.

</details>

### 致命的抓捕行动

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 既然这个组织如此强大，政府之前在做什么？为什么梅乔能逃避追捕这么久？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Okay. Given what you've both laid out about the steady and menacing rise of this group and their power across Mexico, I think a lot of people are going to be wondering at this point, what was the government doing this whole time that this was happening?

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 梅乔非常谨慎，他只使用人力传信，不使用电话或电台。2012 年和 2015 年政府曾接近过他，但他的手下通过纵火封锁城市，甚至击落了一架军用直升机让他逃脱。过去十年的失败既是因为无能，也是因为**勾结**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: The reality is El Mencho was very elusive. He basically... just used human messengers. He was not on the phone. He did not use radio. In 2015, they also nearly caught El Mencho, but his gunmen literally shot down a Mexican military helicopter, killing three soldiers, and he got away then as well. But over the past decade, there really haven't been many close calls. And I think that is in part because of incompetence by the Mexican authorities, but it is also in part because of complicity.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 那么这次行动是如何成功的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And it's what makes it even more shocking that the Mexican government was able to go up against El Mencho this time and actually get him. So Jack, walk me through how that operation went down.

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 周日上午，墨西哥特种部队在六架直升机的支援下，突袭了瓜达拉哈拉南部的一处出租屋。梅乔试图从后门逃走，躲在灌木丛中，但在交火中受了致命伤，在送往医院的直升机上死亡。情报显示，他这次有点大意了。墨西哥政府通过跟踪他的一名**情妇**确认了他的行踪。此外，**CIA** 也提供了关键情报，虽然现场没有美国地面部队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: So, what we know is that on Sunday morning, Mexican special forces and the Mexican army raided a rental home... they got into a very intense firefight with El Mencho and his men. Mencho slipped out the back and tried to escape... Eventually, Mexican forces then found him hiding in the brush. They shot Mencho and his bodyguards. The Mexican government says that they identified a "close associate" of a woman who was one of El Mencho's lovers. It also appears that there was important information coming from the CIA.

</details>

### 特朗普的压力与主权

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 为什么墨西哥政府选择在这个时刻采取行动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Marie and Jack, I think one of the biggest questions hanging over all this is just given how long this cartel's power has been steadily expanding... why did the Mexican government do this at this moment? Why now?

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 这是一个非常激进的攻势，背景是现任总统 **希恩鲍姆**（Claudia Sheinbaum）想要采取与前任不同的策略。另一个重大因素是 **唐纳德·J·特朗普**。白宫一直在施加持续的压力，特朗普威胁说如果墨西哥不解决卡特尔问题，美国军队就会介入。他公开威胁要进行单边军事打击，希恩鲍姆总统将其视为不可逾越的红线。因此，墨西哥政府正在竭尽全力证明他们可以独立处理这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: For one, the Mexican authorities had a piece of very actionable intelligence... But this also comes amid the backdrop of a very aggressive offensive against the cartels by President Shane Bomb (Sheinbaum). And then there also is one other major difference and that is Donald J. Trump. What we have in Mexico right now is a sustained pressure campaign from the White House to do more against the cartels. He is saying the Mexican government must solve its cartel problems or the US military will do it.

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 这种威胁在墨西哥引起了极大的不安。考虑到历史原因，墨西哥非常看重**主权**。而且特朗普并不是在虚张声势，他刚刚通过军事行动罢免了委内瑞拉总统。据希恩鲍姆的核心圈子透露，这正是让她彻夜难眠的事情。如果美国采取单边行动，可能会终结她的政治生涯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Well, you have to remember that California used to be Mexico. There's concerns about sovereignty... And it should be said, this isn't just an idle threat that Trump is making at this point, right? This is a president who has literally just gone into Venezuela and ousted the president by force. It's what keeps President Shamb (Sheinbaum) up at night.

</details>

### 根深蒂固的腐败挑战

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 击毙首领是否意味着卡特尔的终结？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Given that, let's talk about what this capture means for the cartel that El Mencho ran moving forward. How big of a blow is this for them?

</details>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: 历史证明，除掉首领并不意味着组织消失。梅乔手下有四五名指挥官。如果他们不能达成继任协议，卡特尔就会发生内斗和分裂，这可能会在墨西哥各地引发无数的小规模战争。真正的挑战在于解决**腐败**。除非墨西哥政府开始追究那些为卡特尔提供便利的腐败政客，否则很难取得实质性进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maria Abi-Habib**: Well, it depends on whether or not the commanders who were under El Mencho can agree amongst themselves a clear clean path to succession. If the cartel cannibalizes itself... then we could see it fracture. I think that what we haven't seen from the Mexican government is addressing the corruption. The reality is the only way for this criminal group to get this powerful and this big is through the complicity of officials across the nation.

</details>

**Jack Nicas**: 特朗普的“球门柱”是无限移动的。在击毙梅乔不到 24 小时后，特朗普就在网上发帖称“墨西哥必须加大打击卡特尔和毒品的力度”。这表明要求不会停止。但也许这正是必要的，因为特朗普的压力正在创造一种墨西哥以前从未有过的动力，迫使政府真正去对抗这些强大的犯罪组织。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jack Nicas**: I think Trump's goalposts are infinite. Less than 24 hours after the Mexican government killed El Mencho... Trump posted online, quote, "Mexico must step up their efforts on cartel and drugs." And that is, I think, a clear sign that the demands aren't going to end. And possibly that's also what is necessary because there are signs that Trump's pressure is creating a dynamic in Mexico that really hasn't existed before.
