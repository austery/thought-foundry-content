### 开场致辞与“我感觉很好”的故事

非常感谢，殿下，哈康王储。非常感谢您。我期待稍后与您会面，也感谢您在气候问题上所做的个人承诺，这非常重要。感谢挪威银行行长兼主席伊达·沃尔登·巴赫和尼古拉·坦根邀请我，尼古拉。我很荣幸来到这里，尤其是能与克里斯蒂娜·拉加德同台。那真是一场精彩的演讲，确实非常出色。克里斯蒂娜，多年来我们成为了非常亲密的朋友，能与您和克里斯汀·哈尔沃森在这里，我感到非常荣幸。非常感谢，期待在这些发言之后进行对话。很高兴再次回到奥斯陆。我在这里待了三天，遇到的朋友们问我的第一个问题就是关于唐纳德·特朗普。我今天不打算谈论唐纳德·特朗普，但我遇到了一位在美国经商的挪威商人朋友，我问他如何看待特朗普的政策和决定。他说：“我感觉很好。”他说话的方式让我想起了一个我四十年前听过的故事。我来自田纳西州纳什维尔，那是乡村音乐和大奥普里剧院的故乡。在那些日子里，有一位名叫“珍珠表姐”的喜剧演员，她穿着印花连衣裙，戴着一顶草帽，帽子上还挂着价格标签。她的幽默是质朴的乡村风格。她讲了一个故事：作为一名年轻的国会议员，我在参加了一天的市政厅会议后开车回农场。

<p class="english-text">Thank you very much um your royal highness crown prince Hulkon. Thank you very much. I look forward to meeting with you later and thank you by the way for your own personal commitment on the climate issue. It's quite important to Eda Waldenbotch the governor and chair of Georgia Bank Nikolai Tangen. Thank you for inviting me Nikolai. I am honored to be here especially it is an honor to share the stage with Christine Lagard. That was a brilliant speech really and truly it was out outstanding and um Sher Christine we have become very very close friends over the years and it's an honor to be here with you and Kristen Halverson thank you very much look forward to the conversation after these remarks. It's a great pleasure to be back here in Oslo. I've been here for three days and one of the first questions I've received uh from friends that I meet here is about Donald Trump. I don't intend to talk about Donald Trump today, but I met with a friend who is a Norwegian businessman who does business uh in the United States, and I asked him how he felt about Trump's policies and decisions. And he said, "I feel fine." And there was something about the way he said it that reminded me of a story that I heard actually 40 years ago. I come from Nashville, Tennessee. the home of country music and the Grand Old Opry. And back in those days, they had a comedian named Cousin Mini Pearl who wore a calico dress and a straw hat with the price tag still hanging from the hat. And she she had homespun rural humor. And she told a story. I was driving back to my farm after a day of town hall meetings as a young congressman.</p>

她讲了一个关于一个农民卷入事故的故事，农民起诉对方司机要求赔偿。当对方司机的律师有机会盘问这位农民时，律师说：“是不是在事故发生后，你立刻说‘我感觉很好’？”农民说：“嗯，没那么简单。你看，我当时正开着卡车把我的牛运到城里，然后这个人就横穿高速公路开了过来。”律师说：“我反对，法官大人。我们不想听冗长复杂的故事。请只回答是或否。事故发生后你是否立刻说了‘我感觉很好’？”

<p class="english-text">and she told about a farmer who was involved in an accident and he sued the other driver for damages. And when the other driver's lawyer had the chance to cross-examine this farmer, he said, "Now, isn't it true that immediately after this accident, you said, "I feel fine." And the farmer said, "Well, it's not that simple. You see, I was driving my cow to town in the back of my truck, and this fell came driving across the center of the highway, and the lawyer said, "I object, your honor. We don't want to hear a long involved story. Just answer the question, yes or no. Did you or did you not say immediately after the accident, I feel fine."</p>
</details>

农民说：“嗯，我正要说到那儿。你看，我当时正开着卡车把我的牛运到城里，然后这个人就横穿中心线，直接撞上了我的卡车，把卡车撞翻了，把我甩了出去，也把牛甩了出去。我在这边，牛在那边。警察走过来，看了一眼那头牛，说：‘它正在受苦。’然后他掏出枪，一枪打在牛的两眼之间。他走到我这边的卡车旁，说：‘你感觉怎么样？’”所以，那位商人的评论让我想起了那个故事。

<p class="english-text">Farmer said, "Well, I was leading up to that. You see, I was driving my cow to town in the back of my truck, and this fell came driving across the center line and ran right smack dab into my truck and knocked it over and threw me out and threw the cow out. I was on one side and the cow was on the other and the policeman came up and took one look at that cow and said, "She is suffering." Pulled out his gun and shot her right between the eyes. Came around to my side of the truck and said, "How do you feel?" And uh so there was something about the businessman's comment that reminded me of that story.</p>

### 全球可持续发展转型：挑战与停滞

毫无疑问，我们正处于全球可持续发展转型的关键时刻，它一直面临着巨大的逆风。但正如拉加德总裁雄辩地指出的那样，这些逆风变得更加强劲，每个人都心知肚明。在我的投资公司**世代投资管理公司**（Generation Investment Management: 一家专注于可持续投资的公司），我们每年都会发布一份可持续发展趋势报告。这已经是第九年了。我们找不到任何地方能把所有信息整合在一起，所以我们每年都尝试这样做。我们今年的主要发现是，虽然有一些停滞，但也有一些值得乐观的理由。十年前，预测是气温将上升3.6°C。现在这个数字已经降到了2.7°C。所以我们已经减少了近1%，但这还远远不够。自2001年以来，我们或多或少地停滞在这个水平。根据目前的国家政策，预计的气温上升幅度四年内没有变化。我们都知道原因。存在巨大的政治阻力，使得各国越来越难以采取新政策并提高其气候雄心。

<p class="english-text">Well, there's no doubt that we're at a a critical moment in the global sustainability transition and it's always faced significant headwinds. But as uh uh President Lagarde has very eloquently said, those headwinds have become stronger and everybody knows it. Uh at at my investment firm, Generation Investment Manager, we do an annual sustainability trends report. This is the ninth year. We couldn't find any place where it was all put together and so we've tried to do it each year. A and our our key findings uh this year are that um there is some pause but there's also reason for uh some good feelings. You know 10 years ago the projections were that we would um reach a 3.6° C increase in temperatures. That has now been cut down to 2.7. So we've shaved off nearly 1% but it's not nearly enough. And since 2001 we have more or less stalled out at that level. The estimated temperature rise under current national policies has not moved in four years. And we all know the reasons. There is a huge political push back that has made it harder and harder for countries to adopt new policies and improve their climate uh ambition.</p>

### 创新、既得利益者与政治权力

上周，瑞典诺贝尔委员会（顺便说一句，我更喜欢挪威诺贝尔委员会）将今年的经济学奖授予了三位杰出经济学家。一半授予乔尔·莫基尔（Joel Mokyr），另一半授予他的两位同事。我认为他们因何获奖值得反思，因为在我看来，这是近几十年来更具影响力的奖项之一。莫基尔几十年来一直持有的观点是，创新是经济繁荣和增长的关键。但他的两位同事指出，扼杀创新的因素之一是，当那些有理由害怕创新带来的变革的强大现有产业，可能已经积累了过多的政治权力，结果他们能够阻止创新的引入。

<p class="english-text">You know, uh, last week the Swedish Nobel Committee award I by the way much prefer the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Uh, but the Swedish committee awarded its economics prize this year to three distinguished economists. Half to Joel Moer and half to two of his colleagues. And I think it's worth reflecting because on what they are honored for finding because it's one of the more consequential awards uh in the last several decades in my opinion. Mocher who has had a narrative throughine for decades makes the point that innovation is the real key uh to economic uh prosperity and growth. But his two colleagues have pointed out that one of the factors that stifles innovation is when powerful incumbent industries that have a reason to fear the changes that come with innovation might have gathered too much political power uh and as a result are able to stop the introduction of innovations.</p>

化石燃料行业在“捕获”政治家方面，比在“捕获”排放物方面效率高得多。因此，他们利用积累的政治权力来抵制并削弱世界急需的进步。我们每天仍向**对流层**（Troposphere: 大气层最低层，地球上大部分天气现象发生在此层）排放1.75亿吨人为造成的全球变暖污染物。这些污染物不断累积，以至于目前每天额外捕获的热量，相当于每24小时有75万枚第一代原子弹在地球表面爆炸所释放的热量。这正在导致水循环的巨大破坏，并产生日益恶化的巨大后果。当我们试图重新启动2021年停滞的进展时，我们也面临着一股右翼民粹主义浪潮，这至少使世界各地的政治复杂化。我们看到了动荡的几年，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵，天然气供应的中断，正如拉加德总裁雄辩地描述的那样，还有我们希望迅速忘记的疫情，但它确实在许多方面重塑了政治格局。我们不要忘记，我们仍在应对中国加入**世界贸易组织**（WTO: World Trade Organization: 旨在促进国际贸易的全球性组织）后出现的超级全球化，许多高薪工作离心式地重新分配到世界各地的低工资地区，以及导致各国政治普遍不满的超级不平等的加剧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And the fossil fuel industry is significantly more efficient at capturing politicians than capturing emissions. Uh and as a result, they have used the accumulated political power to push back and to blunt the progress that the world needs very seriously. We are continuing to put 175 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the troposphere every day. And it accumulates to the point where it presently traps as much extra heat each day as would be released by 750,000 first generation atomic bombs exploding on the earth's surface every 24 hours. Uh this is causing a massive disruption of the water cycle. it is creating uh massive consequences that are getting worse by the day. And as we seek to restart the progress that stalled out um in 2021, we also confront a wave of right-wing populism that has at best complicated politics around the world. And we have seen a tumultuous few years with the sadistic invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with the interruption of gas supplies, as President Lagarde has eloquently described, the pandemic, which we want to forget quickly, but really royal politics in quite a significant number of ways. And lest we forget, we are still coping with the hyper globalization that followed China's admission to the WTO with the centrifugal redistribution of many higher wage jobs to low-wage venues around the world and an increase in hyper inequality that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction that infects the politics of every nation.</p>

### COP 30与全球气候雄心

因此，缺乏进展是今年如此关键的原因。不到一个月后，世界各国将在巴西举行**COP 30**（Conference of the Parties: 联合国气候变化框架公约缔约方大会），这是联合国主导的年度国际气候谈判。十年前在巴黎，195个国家同意到2050年实现**净零排放**（Net Zero: 指在特定时期内，通过各种方式抵消所有温室气体排放，使净排放量为零）。只有一个国家退出了。我很不好意思地提醒大家，那就是我的国家。但我也想指出一个重要的数学等式，有些人似乎会周期性地忘记：195减1不等于零。其他国家正在迎头赶上并填补空白。欧盟正在发挥领导作用，没有哪个国家像挪威一样提供如此多的领导力。不幸的是，特朗普总统的当选使这个问题变得相当复杂，他的行动也影响了一些其他国家，这些国家放慢了自身的进展。但没有其他国家退出。我们看到新的国家计划正在出台。到目前为止，这些计划远比应有的要弱。这些计划的薄弱令人担忧，但并非完全出乎意料，因为如果历史上最大的全球变暖污染排放国不参与解决这个集体问题，那么这可能会损害其他国家自行解决问题的动力。但挪威是那些有望扭转我所认为的短暂倒退趋势的国家之一。在COP 30之前提交新的气候计划，挪威表明气候行动仍在议程上。当然，细节决定成败。但我要赞扬挪威坚定不移地致力于帮助发展中国家适应那些已无法避免的变化。事实上，挪威在海外发展援助和其他援助方面的记录确实非常出色。你们通常将国民收入的1%以上用于这些目的。据我所知，没有其他国家能达到这个记录。我的国家接近0.25%。这还是在本届政府开始削减对外援助之前。挪威已承诺到2026年将其气候融资比2020年的数字翻一番，并且在过去两年中已经实现了这一目标。挪威还在拯救世界热带雨林方面发挥了坚定的作用，为此贡献了相当于数十亿美元的资金。

<p class="english-text">So that lack of progress is why this year is so critical. And in less than a month, the nations of the world will meet in Brazil for COP 30, the annual UNled international climate negotiations. And 10 years ago in Paris, 195 countries agreed to get to net zero by 2050. Only one nation has withdrawn. I'm embarrassed to remind you that it's my nation. But I also want to note a significant u mathematical equation that some people seem to forget episodically. 195 minus one does not equal zero. Other nations are stepping up and filling the gap. uh and the European European Union is playing a leadership role and no nation is providing as much leadership truly as Norway is providing. Um and unfortunately uh the election of President Trump has complicated this quite uh significantly but of course and his actions are influencing some other nations which have slowed down their own progress. But no other nation has withdrawn. We are seeing new national plans come out. So far they are much weaker than they need to be. And the weakness of these plans is worrisome but not entirely surprising because if the largest emitter of global warming pollution in history uh is not participating in solving this collective problem, then that can damage the motivation of other countries uh to tackle it themselves. But Norway is one of the nations poised to usher in a reversal of what I believe is destined to be a short-lived trend of backsliding. In submitting a new climate plan ahead of COP 30, Norway has indicated that action is still on the agenda. And of course, as always, the devil is in the details. But I want to applaud Norway's robust and ongoing commitment to helping developing nations adapt to the changes that can no longer be avoided. In fact, Norway's track record of overseas development assistance uh and other aid is truly remarkable. You've routinely committed more than 1% of your national income to these purposes. No other country I'm aware of can match that record. My own country is closer to a quarter of a percentage point. And that's before the current administration started slashing foreign aid. And Norway has committed to doubling its climate finance by 2026 compared with the 2020 figure and has already achieved this goal for the past two years. Norway has also played a stalwart role in saving helping to save the world's tropical forests contributing the equivalent of many billions of US dollars to that cause. It is important to recognize, however, that government-to-government aid, as essential as it is, uh, pales in comparison to the needed access to private capital in order to finance the energy transition.</p>

然而，我们必须认识到，政府间援助，尽管至关重要，但与为能源转型提供资金所需的私人资本相比，显得微不足道。

### 私人资本与发展中国家的困境

过去几年中最有希望和乐观的趋势之一是，例如去年，如果你看看全球各地所有新安装的发电量，许多人会惊讶地发现，可再生能源所占的比例达到了93%。国际能源署（International Energy Agency）预测，未来几年，这一比例将超过95%。那么，用于安装这93%可再生能源的资金来自哪里呢？85%的资金来自私人资本，只有15%来自政府支持。然而，资本获取存在不平等的分配。经济学家称之为**本土偏见**（Home Bias: 投资者倾向于投资本国资产的现象）。此外，投资者和贷款人也不愿向发展中国家投入资本，因为这些国家存在货币估值突然变化的明显风险，这可能导致他们蒙受损失。当然，他们会担心。合同执行的法院可及性、政府的连续性以及某些地区的腐败。所有这些因素都使得发展中国家的利率比挪威或美国高出两到三倍。因此，他们被剥夺了获取资本的机会。以非洲为例。非洲拥有全球60%的优质太阳能潜力。但非洲安装的太阳能电池板数量甚至少于美国佛罗里达州一个州。这是对当前全球资本分配体系的一种可耻的评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the most hopeful and optimistic trends of the last few years, last year for example, if you look at all of the new electricity generation installed worldwide everywhere in the world, many are surprised to hear that the percentage represented by renewable energy was 93%. And the International Energy Agency has projected that in the years ahead, it's going to exceed 95% renewable energy. But where did the money come from to install that 93% renewable energy? 85% of the money came from private capital, only 15% from government to support. However, there is an unequal malistribution of access to capital. There is what the economists call a home bias. And there is also a reluctance on the part of investors and lenders to commit to capital in uh infusions into developing countries where there is a noticeable risk of currency valuation on a sudden basis which might cause them to lose their money. Of course, they're going to be concerned. uh access to courts for the enforcement of contracts, continuity of government, continuity of government, uh corruption in some areas. All of these factors have raised the interest rates for developing countries two to three times higher than what Norway or the United States would pay. Uh and as a result, they have been deprived of access to capital. Take Africa for example. Africa has 60% of the prime solar energy potential of the entire world. But Africa has fewer solar panels installed than the single US state of Florida. That is a disgraceful commentary on the current system for the allocation of capital around the world.</p>
</details>

发展中国家作为一个整体，只获得了为能源转型和更广泛的可持续发展转型提供资金所需的一小部分资本。他们获得了43%的新化石燃料开发投资，几乎所有这些都是为了将化石燃料资源从发展中国家出口到富裕国家。我在发展中国家活动家社区的朋友们称之为**化石燃料殖民主义**（Fossil Fuel Colonialism: 指富裕国家通过投资发展中国家的化石燃料资源，以牺牲当地环境和人民利益为代价，获取能源利益的现象）。当然，尼日利亚等国家所经历的资源诅咒是需要避免的，尤其是在我们现在拥有太阳能和风能这两种卓越的可再生能源的情况下。太阳能和风能的成本持续以非常令人印象深刻的速度下降。

<p class="english-text">Developing countries as a whole are getting a tiny share of the capital necessary to finance the energy transition and the larger sustainability transition. They are getting 43% of the new investment in fossil fuel development, virtually all of it for exporting fossil fuel resources from developing countries to the wealthy countries. My friends in the activist community in developing countries call it fossil fuel colonialism. And of course, the resource curse that countries like Nigeria have experienced is to be avoided, especially now that we have a superior source of energy in renewable energy, both solar uh and wind. and the cost of solar and wind uh continue to go down uh very very uh impressively.</p>
</details>

### 挪威的领导作用与可再生能源的蓬勃发展

正如我所说，这个国家在所有这些问题上都是一个令人印象深刻的领导者，挪威的电力部门已经是世界上最清洁的之一。挪威98%的电力容量是零碳的，当然你们有很多水力发电，但你们做出了正确的选择，我们正在看到一个拐点，特别是太阳能的成本达到了前所未有的低水平。以巴基斯坦为例。他们正以创纪录的速度安装廉价的中国太阳能电池板。在巴基斯坦的一些地区，新娘的嫁妆包含三块太阳能板和一个逆变器已经司空见惯。这是一个真实的故事。我们看到这种情况在许多国家迅速发展。太阳能电池板的进口量不仅在非洲的发展中国家，而且在东南亚和世界其他地区都增长得非常快。当太阳能电池板与电池结合时，转型才真正开始站稳脚跟。在我的国家，加州的电网在傍晚时分有20%的电力来自白天充电的太阳能电池。我从澳大利亚飞到这里，南澳大利亚在傍晚时分有30%的电力来自电池。他们的目标是达到100%。专家们相信他们肯定会实现这个目标。因此，继发电之后，化石燃料的第二大市场是交通运输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this nation has been as I've said a very impressive leader in all of these matters and Norway's power sector is already one of the cleanest in the world. 98% of Norway's electricity capacity is carbonf free and of course you have a lot of hydro power but you've made the right choices and and we are seeing an inflection point as the cost of solar in particular reaches unprecedented low levels. Take Pakistan for example. They are installing cheap Chinese solar panels at a record rate. In some areas of Pakistan, it is now not uncommon for a bride's dowy to be three panels and an inverter. Uh and that's a true story. And we are seeing this take off in so many uh countries. Uh imports of solar panels are rising very quickly not only in the developing countries of Africa uh but in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the world. And when solar panels are coupled with batteries, then the transformation really begins to take hold. In my nation, the California grid is getting 20% of its power in the early evening from batteries charged with sunshine earlier in the day. I flew here from Australia and South Australia gets 30% of its power from batteries in the early evening. Their goal is to reach 100%. And the experts believe they definitely will reach that goal. So the second largest market for fossil fuels after electricity generation is transportation.</p>
</details>

在全球范围内，电动汽车的销量今年增长了30%以上。到2025年，电动汽车销量很可能占全球汽车总销量的四分之一。挪威再次成为全球领导者。插电式汽车多年来已经占据了90%以上的市场份额。九月份的数据刚刚公布，挪威所有新车销量的98.3%是电动汽车。所以我想你们可以打勾了。挪威，非常感谢你们的领导。你们的国家车队已经有三分之一是电动汽车，正朝着100%的目标迈进。

<p class="english-text">Uh and worldwide the sales volume of electric cars is up more than 30% this year. Uh will likely be a quarter of all cars sold worldwide uh in 2025. And Norway once again is the global leader. Cars with plugs have been nor more than 90% of the market for years already. And the figures for the month of September just came in. 98.3% of all new car sales in Norway are electric. So I think you can check that box. Norway, thank you very much for your leadership. Your national fleet is already one-third electric on its way toward 100%.</p>
</details>

### 中国的主导地位与地缘政治挑战

我们其他人现在可以环顾挪威，开始看到一个后石油时代的未来。但太阳能、电池和电动交通的蓬勃发展都伴随着巨大的地缘政治挑战。中国做出的决定使其在所有这些以可持续发展为重点的未来产业中占据主导地位。今年五月，中国每天新增的太阳能发电能力，相当于每天开设三座1**吉瓦**（Gigawatt: 功率单位，1吉瓦等于10亿瓦特）的核电站，连续30天。很难想象其他任何国家能做到这一点，而且在每一个相关领域，他们都做出了积极行动以主导这些行业的决定。所以我们必须应对这个挑战。中国似乎认为他们真的会把21世纪变成中国的世纪，并在地缘政治领域为全世界提供领导。我不认为他们能做到。我不认为世界会追随中国，因为世界普遍不认同中国的价值观。我们珍视自由，尽管有时它似乎受到攻击。但我也想指出，对中国动机的怀疑在许多方面都是有道理的，包括他们对**北约**（NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization: 北大西洋公约组织）国家和更广泛的欧洲国家构成的安全风险。中国经济本身离清洁还有很长的路要走。但我们必须认识到他们在能源转型方面所取得的成就。挪威正在激励世界各国。我们必须应对并管理中国在这些技术方面的主导地位。然而，我们也需要认识到，自巴黎协定以来，世界经济的发展方向已经明确。希望继续在全球市场竞争的公司，必须将可持续发展作为其业务运营的核心。美国没有以应有的方式参与。但我确实相信，我的国家也正在发生变化。因此，尽管当前存在政治困难，我们不能让对一个更美好世界的雄心在我们这一代人手中消逝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the rest of us can look around Norway right now and begin to see the start of a post oil future. But there is a huge geopolitical challenge associated with both the solar boom, the battery boom uh and the electric transportation boom. China has made decisions that have allowed it to dominate the market in all of these sustainability focused industries uh in the future. During the month of May this year, China installed as much new solar electric capacity every day as would have been provided by opening three 1 gawatt nuclear plants every day, 30 days in a row. It's difficult to imagine any other country accomplishing that and in every one of the related fields they have made an in a decision to move aggressively to dominate those industries. So we must respond to that challenge. China seems to think that they really will make the 21st century a Chinese century and provide leadership for the entire world perhaps in the geopolitical sphere as well. I don't think they can. I don't think the world will follow China because the world does not generally speaking agree with the values of China. We value freedom even though it seems at times to be under assault. But uh let me also made make the point that suspicion of Chinese motives might well be warranted on many fronts including the security risks that they pose to NATO countries and European countries more generally. The Chinese economy is itself a long way from clean. But we have to recognize that what they have accomplished with the energy transition. Uh Norway uh is inspiring countries around the world. Uh we have to respond and ma to and manage China's dominance of these technologies. And yet we also need to recognize that since Paris, the direction of travel for the world economy has been clear. Companies that want to continue to compete for global markets will have to make sustainability central to their business operations. The United States uh is not participating in the way that it should. But I do believe that change is coming in my country uh as well. So despite the political difficulties of the moment, we cannot let the ambition for a better world wither away on our watch.</p>

### 政治意愿：一种可再生资源

所以，让我引用挪威著名剧作家亨里克·易卜生（Henrik Ibsen）的话来结束我的发言。我不会像克里斯蒂娜那样勇敢，尝试用挪威语说出来。哦，天哪，克里斯蒂娜。在一个我们看到各种机构，特别是金融机构，从他们早期的气候承诺中退缩的时候，我想起了易卜生的《建筑大师》中的一句话：“空中楼阁，它们是如此容易避难，也如此容易建造。”但我想提醒大家另一段话，对我来说，它展示了我们共同的任务。来自《曼登》。他写道：“千言万语，不如一举。”所以，我们所有人都该是时候拿出力量，无视批评者，将我们的言语转化为行动，共同守护人类文明的未来。我们拥有一切所需。国际能源署告诉我们，现有技术可以实现65%的净零排放目标。成熟的商业模式已经为人所知。我们对另外35%也有清晰的路线图。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, let me close by citing Norway's celebrated playwright Henrik Hibson. And I am not going to be brave enough as as Christine was to even attempt to say it in Norwegian. Oh jeez, Christine. At a time when we've seen institutions of all kinds, but particularly financial institutions, back away from their earlier climate commitments, I'm reminded of Ipsson's The Master Builder and the quote, "Castles in the air. They are so easy to take refuge in and so easy to build, too." But I'd like to remind us of another passage which to me demonstrates our collective task. from Manden. He wrote, "A thousand words can't make the mark. A single deed will leave." So, the time has come for all of us to summon our strength and ignore our critics, uh, turn our words into deeds that will collectively safeguard the future of human civilization. We have everything we need. The International Energy Agency tells us the technologies are there for 65% of the way to reducing to net zero. Proven business models are already known. We have clear line of sight to the other 35%.</p>

人类所面临的每一个基于道德的挑战都经历过倡导者感到绝望的时期。废除奴隶制、妇女选举权、结束南非的种族隔离。有时看起来似乎不可能，正如已故的纳尔逊·曼德拉（Nelson Mandela）曾经说过的，在完成之前，一切似乎都是不可能的。当争论的杂草被清除，核心问题被揭示为对错之间的选择时，那么在非常深层次上，结果就注定了。
