### 单人设计团队的规模化挑战与破局契机

在 **AI Engineer** 这样规模仅约12至15人的紧凑团队中，每个人都必须独立承担大量跨职能工作。本届大会的参会人数从预估的6000人激增至7000人，伴随140多家赞助商、300多位演讲嘉宾以及600多场分论坛分享，而背后的设计交付工作却仅由**单人设计团队**（Solo Designer）全权负责。从现场随手可见的贴纸周边、实体与数字指引标牌、展厅主视觉，到官方网站、演讲嘉宾宣发海报及各个技术分论坛的专属吉祥物，每一项物料都是必须按时高质量上线的交付件。成百上千个细节意味着成百上千个潜在的失败点——例如赞助商Logo遗漏或演讲日程印刷错误都会引发重大运营事故。在传统工作模式下这几乎是不可能完成的任务，但借助 **Devin**、**ChatGPT** 以及 **Figma** 构成的AI协作设计团队，工具本身已不再是瓶颈，现实中的业务痛点反而成为了推动设计自动化的最佳灵感与杠杆。

All right. Hello everyone. Hope you guys having a good time at the conference. So, before we start, how many of you are actually designers? Like a product designer. Hey, one hands and another. Okay. And how many I assume that the rest of you are engineers? Is that correct? Yeah, pretty much. Okay. So, today's talk is a non-technical talk, but more of a real-world experience how I created the design for AI Engineer this conference and our other past conference as well and how AI has helped me. And so, the talk today is one designer plus AI, which is me as the designer, and hundreds of deliverables.

All right, let's start. So, my name is Vinson Weng. I am a senior creative designer at AI Engineer. And at AI Engineer, it's a very small team. So, we only have around 12 people to 15 people at the moment. And everyone has been doing their own thing and I think AI has been a really helpful way to like helping everybody doing everything. And at this scale we have a problem, obviously, right? And the problem is the scale problem or I would call the challenges. And how to overcome it? It's basically automation and we get to that in the later part of this talk.

So, when I prepared this talk, we only expected 6,000 attendees and now it's 7,000. Well, good for us. And then we have 140 sponsors. More. 140 plus sponsors. And then 300 plus speakers, 600 plus sessions, and one designer. And everybody needs every designs, right? Like every single thing needs design. Sponsor needs assets, speaker needs graphic. You need signage so you don't get lost. And this is basically what we do, what I do. So, from stickers, do you like your swag, your stickers? Well, I hope you do because I create that design, too. And to a landing page, speaker announcement, track mascot, all the stuff that you see, most of the stuff that you see here, from a signage to a digital signage, landing page, everything is a deliverable.

And a thousand details means a thousand way to fail, right? Because I'm missing sponsor logos, going to be a huge issue. And speakers that have a wrong schedule, also a huge issues, right? And it seems impossible to handle that many kind of deliverables, but yeah, meet my design team. So, it's me and Devin, GPT, and Figma. And right now we are at the stage where tools isn't the problem anymore, but having a real problem is our advantage. So, for example, when someone asked me, "What inspired you when designing in AI engineer?" I don't know the answer back then, but after I think about it, it's actually a problem that inspired me to like designing in this AI engineer. And we'll get to that in the latter part of this talk.

### 跳出模型能力的局限：从基础规范到原子复用

面对大语言模型（LLM）的底层局限，设计师必须具备跳出固有思维框架的破局能力。例如行业内常提及让大模型直接生成矢量图（如经典的“骑自行车的鹈鹕”SVG测试），基础模型的直接输出往往粗糙且无法达到专业交付标准；但如果换一个解题思路，先让 **ChatGPT** 生成高分辨率位图（PNG），再导入 **Figma** 进行矢量化处理，就能迅速交付可用的设计资产。要真正解决超大规模交付问题，关键在于落地五大支柱：夯实基础规范、组件可复用设计、自动化工作流、输出验证以及消除协同摩擦。作为产品设计师背景，核心抓手便是构建**原子设计**（Atomic Design: 将UI界面从最小的颜色、字号等原子拆解并逐步组装为复杂组件的设计方法论）。首先在内部严格统一排版系统（如区分桌面端与移动端的字号阶梯）、调色板和品牌标语；一旦底层基础设施搭建完备，市场等业务团队便能基于既定设计规范快速衍生出邮件模板、宣传单页和文档等资产，甚至吉祥物等核心视觉也能通过标准化模块实现高效率的复用迭代。

So, have you guys seen the talk by Simon Willison like in 2025? Yeah, and it's pretty interesting, right? He asked every LLM to create an a vector file, which is basically a pelican riding a bicycle. And it is basically to test and I tested again and it's still doing this for the basic model. And it's not usable for me as a designer. But as a designer, we have to think outside the box. And we could simply ask ChatGPT create a still image like a PNG for a pelican riding a bicycle and then I can vectorize it on Figma. And we can ship that now. So, we have to think outside the box here regardless the capabilities of the LLM.

And so, how to solve this scale problem, right? Basically five things: foundation first, reusable designs, automated workflows, validated output, and also remove frictions. The foundation is definitely the core part that we need to set up right. Like the design system, typography, colors, components, like other stuff. And once this is set up, like for example, when we create the website, it's all set up within this thing. And yeah, this is just an example. Like we have the colors, primary, and then also the accent colors, the typography, and also the tagline, all the other stuff.

And also, are you guys familiar with the atomic designs? So, yeah, my previous background is I'm a product designer. So, I'm pretty familiar with the thing where we need to create a user-centric design and also like atomic designs, right? Where we create the smallest part possible and then combining it into like basically a LEGO pieces and then into a deliverables. And this is pretty useful in my job desk right now. So, once we set up all of those foundation, we basically need to create—for example, we use Defont a lot. In the office, everybody use Defont, abusing Defont for example. So, in this case, I just need "hey, we use this desktop typography and this mobile typography" because we know Claude or like any other LLMs love to like throwing some random font size, right? And if we don't define it, it just delivering a slop like the previous slop.

And yeah, typography, color and stuff, and then it comes to reusable design. So, once we set up it right, like the website has the branding to it, all the other teams on the AI engineer, like for example the marketing teams can create everything basically. Like they can create an email design based on that. They can create a flyer, a document just based on the website because it's already defined early. And yeah, once you get the design, you can just rinse and repeat. For example, the mascot, it's all has pretty much the same design and it's rinse and repeat. And if you already defining those things, you can basically create one design that works for all.

### AI Agent驱动的自动化流水线与像素级规范交付

在自动化工作流的落地实践中，最大的飞跃在于将繁琐的手工制图转化为由 **Devin** 驱动的即时生成流。以往会议室门外的日程展示牌均需在 Figma 中逐一手动修改排版，如今只需通过自然语言向 Devin 发送指令，指定特定会议室与日期，AI 便会自动拉取最新结构化数据并导出准确无误的高清 PNG，直接拷入闪存盘推送到大屏幕呈现。过去设计师与开发人员在还原UI时往往因为像素偏差陷入无休止的反馈循环（Feedback Loop），而现在借助 **模型上下文协议**（MCP: Model Context Protocol，连接大模型与外部设计及数据工具的标准化协议）或 Figma 自动标注导出的设计规范表（Spec Sheet），Devin 能够精准解析图层间距、字号与色彩参数，实现像素级完美（Pixel-perfect）的代码化交付。在300多位演讲嘉宾的海量物料处理上，团队甚至构建了嘉宾宣发生成器与极受欢迎的集换式卡牌系统，支持随时在线更换嘉宾姓名、自动适配横版与头像等细节，彻底解决了单人难以支撑海量个性化素材制作的痛点。

And this is the part that I'm most interesting to talk about, which is the automated workflows. Before, for example, if you take a look outside the room, there's a schedule, right? The schedule for each and everyone. So, we used to do it manually on Figma, but now we use Devin for it. And let me show you. So, right now we just pull the latest data. I just asked Devin like, "Hey, I want this room at these days." And then we can just export it, download it PNG, and the data is all accurate, and then we can just ship it to the flash drive, and then put it on the screen.

And it was like impossible before because the friction is just too much between the designers and the developers. We cannot make things like pixel perfect because once we tell the designer, "Hey, this is the design." And then—sorry, the engineers that created the design, for example. "Hey, I need this to be delivered." And then they don't create it pixel perfect, it's a lot of feedback loop, right? But with Devin, we just say, "Hey, can you make this more accurate?" We can just connect it to MCP, and then if it doesn't work, we can just always like give a spec sheet or something that can be defined like what's the spacing, what's the font size, etc.

And this is what we do for the speaker announcement. So, we have 300 plus speakers, and it's impossible for me to like handle one by one, right? So, we create this thing, which is called—which you can also access to speaker announcement, and you can also try it yourself. Like this one, for example. You can select it right here. And then you can also change your name. Yeah. For example, this you can change the name to whatever you want. And we also have the landscape mode which can be also loaded. If the speaker also have the headshot and all the details, it will automatically export. And we also have the trading cards which is surprisingly pretty popular. And we have a different team. And this is all pixel perfect. All right. For example, this one. This is inspired by TBPN. And how do I deliver this in pixel perfect? Let's jump into it.

So, the process here is before when I start my career as a product designer, it used to be just okay, we need to research, we need to build product like design thinking in general, right? And then feedback loop and stuff like that. But right now, it's just outdated for me. Like in my case, we just go to Slack, Figma, and then send it back to Slack because Devin live in Slack, and then ship all the things that he need. Like for example, if we can connect the MCP or also the spec document, which is for example the spec sheet like this, which is a plugin in Figma if you interested. It's free and it's basically give an annotation to the PDF. And yeah, all designers don't name their layers, so yeah, this is just like some random frame three, frame four, but the LLM will get it. And it's basically defining all this spacing, all this font size, and then all the colors and stuff. It's definitely going to help you develop a pixel-perfect product.

### 多模态视觉核验、动态容错与从微观解构规模化

在完成生产自动化的基础上，AI 更是充当了可靠的**质量保证团队**（QA Team: 负责检查交付成果是否存在疏漏与缺陷的质检环节）。针对现场包含140多家赞助商的巨幅大厅展板与周边T恤，通过让具备多模态视觉识别能力的 Devin 自动对比原图与设计稿，能够以100%的准确率自动揪出任何遗漏的Logo，有效消除了人眼校对容易疏忽的盲区；在制作演讲嘉宾缩略图时，Devin 还能精准识别摄影师海量抓拍图中的人脸（如准确匹配 Jason Liu 并自动嵌入模板）。此外，系统设计的核心在于消除用户摩擦与敏捷应对异常场景——例如现场日程突发变动且原有界面缺少编辑功能时，只需让 Devin 实时在代码中动态注入编辑入口并重新导出。解决大规模交付难题的根本心法并非好高骛远，而是“从小处着眼”（Think Small）：在设计底层穷尽每一个最小组件与潜在的故障场景，结合人机协同建立全自动流水线与异常防御机制，将复杂的业务挑战转化为推动产品卓越交付的直接动力。

And we also have just recently like today have photos which we have to create the thumbnail for its speaker, right? And then we ask Devin like, "Hey, who is this person?" And yeah, it kind of did. Like I make a Tinder kind of you know, detection if this is the same person or not. And I think it's pretty accurate. It's Jason Liu. Yes. And then we can use this to like for context. Like before, when we create the thumbnail, we have to search all the codes that photographer have and search it one by one and maybe by time if possible. But now we can just like, "Oh, this is Jason Liu. Download that photo." And then we can paste it into the thumbnail, right? And it's pretty amazing. I mean, the world that we live in right now is actually like the state for me as a designer is already at the peak because what else can you ask for, right? I mean, we already have things to automate, we already have things to create the design fast. Basically, all you need is a problem because once you have a problem that worth solving, you can basically solve anything. And back to my talk, I got sidetracked right there. Yeah.

And then yeah. And this is also the amazing thing that we test. So, as you know, we have like hundreds of sponsors, right? Like 140 plus. And as you can see on the at the lobby, we have the banner with all the sponsors. And I basically tell Devin like "Hi, could you compare could you check if there are any missing logos in this graphic?" And the accuracy is 100% based on the test that I do. So, which is pretty well. And we use the same thing for the T-shirt that you got for your swag. And yeah, surprisingly, Devin knows how to like visualize things, right? Like how to detect things visually. And that is very surprising because as a human, we can like give errors. Oh, turns out there's one small something that is missing. But with this kind of thing, we can like double-check. So, human plus AI, combine it, well, you got your own QA team.

And then remove fiction. So, this is just the way of thinking. So, as a designer, we have to think as a user, not as a designer, all right? Because every user has its needs. You can walk through the for example, the map plan here. So, basically, I'm imagining myself as an attendee to go to the registration, go to the see the wayfinding and the QR code and then all the stuff. Basically, everything needs to be connected so you guys don't get lost and knows how to find your rooms and other stuff.

And the real job is handling exceptions. So, for example, oh, I have yeah. For example, there is a schedule update, all right? And when we create this thing, it doesn't has an edit button. And then one morning, it just "Hey, this schedule needs to be updated and we don't have those edit buttons." I could just ask Devin, "Hey, can you add me an edit button?" And then it did. So, we can change everything now and then ship it to PNG and replug it to the screen, which is pretty convenient, right? And those exceptions, right? It it's not possible before when we have to do it manually and stuff. But now it's just get easier.

And so, the takeaway here is that to solve the scale problem, you have to actually think small. Think all the smallest thing possible. Think everything that can go wrong and will go wrong and then try to solve it before. And also, like yeah, right now basically you can automate everything. And at this moment, having a problem is actually going to benefit you because that's going to help you ship a better product, going to ship things that are good. And yeah, I think that's all that I can share. Hope my talk has some benefits to you and yeah. That's all. Thanks, guys.
