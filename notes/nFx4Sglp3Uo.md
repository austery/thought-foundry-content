### 加拿大经济概览与挑战

**主持人**: 2025年2月，**加拿大央行行长Tiff Macklem**即将发表一次演讲。原本是关于货币政策的，但随后情况发生了戏剧性的变化。新的关税尚未生效，但围绕美国贸易政策的不确定性已经影响到我们的经济。如果美国发动一场旷日持久的贸易战，后果可能会很严重。那已经是近一年前的事了。那么，我们看到了什么样的后果，加拿大经济的整体状况如何？接着，我们来看看导致加拿大**青年失业率居高不下**的因素，该失业率在12月达到了13.3%。为什么现在找工作这么难？又能做些什么来降低这个数字呢？最后，这是我们在崭新工作室录制的第一个星期。我们将带您深入幕后，展示这一切是如何实现的，以及是哪些人促成了这一切。欢迎收看The Rundown。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Back in February 2025, Tiff
Macklem, governor of the Bank
of Canada, was set to give a
speech.
It was supposed to be about
monetary policy, but then
things changed dramatically.
>> While the new tariffs have
not yet taken effect, the
uncertainty around US trade
policy is already affecting our
economy.
And if the United States starts
a protracted trade war,
the consequences could be
severe.
>> That was almost a year ago.
So what kind of consequences
have we seen, and what's the
overall state of the Canadian
economy?
Then we take a look at
the factors driving Canada's
high youth unemployment rate,
which hit 13.3% in December.
Why is it so hard to find a job
right now?
And what can be done to bring
that number back down?
And finally, this is our first
week taping in our beautiful
new studio.
We take you behind the scenes
to show you how it all
came together and the people
who made it happen.
This is The Rundown.

</details>

**主持人**: 即使是那些靠预测为生的人，也很难预测到2025年的事件。我们经历了贸易战、不断变化的全球联盟、政治不确定性，所有这些都对一个国家的经济健康状况产生了重大影响。我想了解加拿大经济如何应对这一切，以及未来可能走向何方。于是，我与**德勤加拿大公司（Deloitte Canada）的首席经济学家Dawn Desjardins**进行了一次谈话。Dawn，非常感谢您接受我们的采访。您好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Even people whose job is
making predictions would
probably have had a hard time
predicting the events of 2025.
We had trade wars,
changing global alliances,
political uncertainty, all
things that have major effects
on the health of a country's
economy.
I wanted to know how Canada's
economy is dealing with all this
and what could lie ahead.
So I sat down for a talk with
Dawn Desjardins, chief economist
at Deloitte Canada.
Dawn, thank you so much for
having us.
Are you doing?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 我很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I'm good.
How are you?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 我很好。我想先看看加拿大的经济增长图表。过去一年，第二季度GDP**收缩了1.8%**，随后有所反弹。第三季度增长了2.6%。这是我们拥有的最新数据时期。但对第四季度以及全年来看，预测是积极的。您能告诉我们，是什么驱动了这种所谓的“温和扩张”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I'm doing well.
I want to
start with a chart of Canadian
economic growth.
Over the past year,
GDP contracted 1.8% in
the second quarter,
then bounced back.
It was up 2.6% in quarter three.
That's the last period
for which we have data.
But the forecast are positive
for Q4 and right through the
year.
Can you tell us what are
the main drivers of this?
We'll call them modest
expansion.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，短期来看，我认为更多的问题在于什么**没有**真正驱动我们，那就是消费者。加拿大的**人口结构**在过去几年里发生了显著变化。因此，当我们考虑2026年将发生什么时，我们将看到一个经济体，它不会从人口增长中获得那种（您所说的）推动力。所以我们认为，至少在短期内，这可能是一种情况，即您会看到**消费活动疲软，住房市场活动疲软**。这取决于您居住的地方，情况有些复杂。因此，总的来说，这会带来一点积极影响。但同样，速度不会很快。我认为我们面临的一个大问题，至少在我们预测的初期，是**企业方面**正在发生的事情。我的意思是，企业面临着极大的不确定性，这是可以理解的，因为全球经济正在发生变化。所以我们**没有看到任何企业投资**。这在2025年已经显现出来。我们预计在2026年初，情况仍将如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, in the near term,
I think it's more a question of
what's not really driving us,
and that will be the consumer.
The demographics for Canada
have changed significantly over
the last couple of years.
And so when we think about
what's happening in 2026,
we're going to see
an economy which isn't
getting that talk, if you will,
from that population growth.
And so we think that in the
near term anyway, it's probably
going to be a situation where
you have weak consumption
activity, housing market
activity.
It's a bit mixed depending
where you live.
And so that two on net
will be a bit of a positive.
But again, not super quick.
I think one of the big issues
that we're confronting
as we go through,
at least the first part of our
forecast, is what's happening
on the business front.
I mean, businesses are
extraordinarily uncertain,
and it makes sense because of
what's happening in
the global economy.
So we haven't seen any business
investment.
And that's certainly played out
in 2025.
And we think in the early part
of 2026, that's still going to
be the case.

</details>

### 2026年经济预测与利率

**主持人**: 好的。话虽如此，正如您所提到的，总的来说，我们预计2026年**增长率为1.5%**。考虑到您所描述的挑战，这是一个乐观的数字还是一个悲观的数字？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right.
With that being said,
as you mentioned, net overall,
we expect in 2026 a
growth rate of 1.5%.
Is that an optimistic number
or pessimistic one, considering
the challenges that you sort of
laid out?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 我认为，当我们看这个数字时，它看起来并不算太亮眼。但我认为我们将其视为一个“一分为二”的年份，意味着上半年可能会感觉**迟缓和疲软**。但随着2026年的推进，我们认为有很多理由相信我们将看到更强劲的活动。首先，我们相信**利率将保持在2.25%的低位**。这远低于2024年中期的5%。所以这将是好事。它将帮助消费者，也将帮助消费者，因为我们今年仍有大量抵押贷款需要再融资。2021年，人们获得这些抵押贷款时，利率非常低。现在虽然没那么低了，但肯定比我们看到高利率时要低得多。所以这将提供一些缓解。而且请记住，过去几年我们经历了大量的就业增长。我们经历了大量的工资增长。所以这将帮助这些消费者度过这个时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, I think when we look
at that number, it doesn't look
all that hot for the year.
But I think we're looking at it
as a year in two halves,
meaning first half probably
going to be feeling sluggish
and soft.
But as we round out 2026,
we think there's lots of
reasons to believe we're going
to see stronger activity.
First of all, interest rates
we believe will remain low
at 2.25%.
That's much lower than the 5%
of where we saw in mid 2024.
So that will be good.
And it's going to help consumers
and it's going to help
consumers, because we
still have a lot of mortgages
that are going to refinance
this year.
In 2021, when people took
those mortgages, the rates
were really low.
Now it's not as low,
but it certainly is a lot lower
than what we saw when we had
those high interest rates.
So that's going to provide
some relief.
And remember, we've had lots of
employment growth over the past
few years.
We've had lots of wage growth.
So that's going to help
those consumers navigate
through this period.

</details>

### 加美贸易关系与关税影响

**Dawn Desjardins**: 另一个，我希望这不是一个过于乐观的预测，但我们在7月份将迎来**Kuzma审查**。在那里，我们所消费的……再次强调，这是我们预测的一个相当大的假设，即我们将基本上保留我们对美国市场的免关税准入。现在，这并不一定意味着木材、钢铁、铝和成品汽车可能不会看到很多变化。所以我们已经考虑了这一点。变化不大。这意味着经济的这些部分将保持相当疲软。但经济的其他部分，我们可以免关税出口到美国，这可以占到我们出口的90%到95%。这些将是我们可以想象甚至拥有优势的领域，因为它们的税率比其他国家低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The other and I hope this
isn't a hopeful prediction,
but we do have the Kuzma review
excuse me in July.
And there what we're consuming.
And again this is a pretty big
assumption for our forecast is
that we will retain our access
to the US market basically
tariff free.
Now it doesn't necessarily imply
that lumber, steel,
and aluminium finished autos
may not see a lot of
change there.
So we baked that in.
Not a lot of change.
That means that those parts of
the economy will remain pretty
weak.
But the other parts of
the economy where we can
actually export to the United
States tariff free, and that
can be up to 90, 95% of our
exports.
Those are really going
to be areas where conceivably
we might even have an advantage,
because they're lower rate than
other countries.

</details>

### 政府支出与财政赤字

**主持人**: 2025年，我们看到联邦政府在支出方面有很多新闻头条，大量的支出，大量的基建。2025年和2026年的增长有多少是联邦政府额外支出造成的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> In 2025, we saw a number of
headlines with the federal
government in regards to
spending a lot of spending,
a lot of infrastructure.
How much of the growth in 2025
and 2026 is a result of
the additional
spending by the federal
government?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 是的，2025年有一部分是因为我们确实看到了国防方面的显著增长，主要是通过工资和薪金。所以这确实起到了一定的提振作用。随着我们进入今年，您知道，我们将继续看到一些支出。它会带来巨大的提振吗？可能不会，因为所有这些都是大项目，需要一段时间才能让资金到位。但话虽如此，在边际上肯定会起到作用。我们认为政府支出的**投资方面**会带来提振，而不是消费方面，因为我们知道政府劳动力等会受到很多削减。所以我们认为2026年将从政府投资方面获得提振。我还要补充一点，我们将看到许多其他政策变化，我们认为这些变化将有助于那些希望投资的企业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yeah, 2025, some of it
because we did see a
significant increase in the
defence side, mainly through
wages and salaries.
So that did give a bit of
a lift.
And as we go through
the course of this year,
you know, we're going to
continue to see some spending
now.
Is it going to be an
enormous lift.
Probably not because all
of these are big ticket items
and it takes a while for
that money to flow through.
But having said that,
on the margin definitely going
to be the case.
We think that the the investment
side of government spending,
not so much the consumption
side, because we know
there's going to be a lot of
cuts to government workforce,
for example.
So we say that we will
get a lift in 2026 from the
government investment side.
The other thing I guess I'd say
is we're going to have a lot of
other changes in policy that we
think will be helpful for
businesses who are looking to
invest.

</details>

**主持人**: 比如什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Like what?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，我们将看到……我的意思是，再次强调，这是我们的假设：**消除或至少减少省际贸易壁垒**。这对全国各地的许多公司来说都是一个巨大的机遇，这确实令人惊叹。我们还认为我们将看到一些**监管的减少**。您知道，当我们审视那些开始投资的公司时，它们会遇到巨大的延误、繁琐的法规和大量的繁文缛节。那么，如果政府承诺减少这些，我们认为这将有助于缓解企业方面的压力。所以，虽然这不是直接的政府支出本身，但缓解其中一些真正的障碍，我认为这对企业来说将是件好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, we're going to see and
I mean, again, this is what our
assumptions are elimination or
at least a reduction in
inter-provincial trade barriers.
So that opens up for a lot of
companies across the country,
which is really quite amazing.
We also think we're going to
see some reduction in some of
the regulation.
You know, when we look at
companies who are starting to
invest, they're looking at
big delays, lots of regulations,
lots of red tape.
Well, to the extent that we
have a commitment from
governments that they will
reduce this, we think that's
going to alleviate some
pressure from the business side
as well.
So while it's not
direct government spending per
se, the alleviation of some of
these, these real impediments,
I think that's going to be good
for the business side.

</details>

**主持人**: 继续谈论支出方面，联邦财政支持导致本年度**联邦赤字达780亿美元**。有人可能会说，政府支出如此巨额的资金存在很多风险，经济风险。当我们谈论充满不确定性的一年时，您是否认为这种风险是存在的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Staying on the spending side,
the federal financial support
is contributing to a federal
deficit of $78 billion this
year.
There's a lot of risk
that some would say economic
risk that come with government
spending this much money.
When we talk about a year of
lots of uncertainty,
do you take that that notion
that this is risky?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 不太算。原因在于，当我们审视像**债务偿还成本占我们收入的比例**这样的事情时。所以，从全国范围来看，您知道，我们有债务，也有赤字在增加债务。但我们的利率也更低。所以当我们考虑，好的，纳税人需要花多少钱来融资，来支付债务利息。所以现在大约是**每收入一美元，支付0.10美元**。为什么这听起来还可以？因为在90年代中期，这个比例是0.38美元。所以，您知道，我们过去已经做了很多财政上的艰苦工作。现在我们正在投资于我们的未来。所以这就是为什么我会说，是的，这些数字很大。考虑到当前的环境，它们听起来有点吓人。但我确实认为我们需要做这些事情。我们需要投资于我们的基础设施。我们需要在……您知道，帮助公司能够投入资金并感到他们将获得投资回报。这不会让他们等待几十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Not really.
And the reason is because when
we look at things like this,
debt service costs as a
percentage of our revenues.
So nationally, you know,
we have debt and we have
deficits which are adding to
that debt.
But we also have rates
that are lower.
And so when we think about,
okay, how much does it cost
taxpayers to actually finance
to pay the interest
on that debt.
So right now it's about
$0.10 on a dollar of revenue.
Now why does that sound okay.
Because in the mid '90s
that was $0.38.
So you know we have done
a lot of the hard work fiscally
in the past.
Now we're looking at an
investment in our future.
And so that's why I would
say yeah those numbers are big.
And they sound a bit scary
given the current environment.
But I do think that we need to
do these things.
We need to invest in
our infrastructure.
We need to help companies
in terms of, you know,
being able to put their
money to work and feel that
they are going to get a return
on those investment.
That's not going to take them
decades.

</details>

### 通胀风险与供应链

**主持人**: 好的。我将稍微回顾一下，不像您那么久远，但政府最近两次进行了大规模支出。大流行病，不用看太远。现在当我们谈论我们与美国的贸易关系时，在大流行病的情况下，通货膨胀确实上升了。请告诉我，为什么您不认为这次政府进行更大规模支出时会出现这种情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Okay.
I'm going to go back a
little bit in time, not as far
as you have, but the government
has embarked on big spending
twice recently.
Pandemic don't have to look far.
And now when we talk about our
trade relationship with the US,
in the case of the pandemic,
though, inflation rose.
Tell me why you do not expect
that to be the case
as the government
embarks on higher spending this
time around.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 他们在花什么钱？嗯，他们不得不花钱来支持人们。而且我们还面临一种情况，就是当我们走出大流行病时，我们有巨大的需求，但**没有工人**。所以公司不得不提高工资。所以我们看到工资显著上涨，结果是，这助长了价格上涨。所以这就是支出的类型。现在当我们展望未来时，这些是**投资支出**，而且这些都不会很快发生。这是其中一件事，您知道，如果我们考虑建造一条管道，建造一个港口，这不会很快发生。所以这是支出的渐进式增加。所以这是以不同的方式支出。我想另一件要考虑的事情是我们的**供应链**，到目前为止，我们还没有看到成本显著飙升，而这……您知道，加拿大公司将不得不转嫁给消费者。这在很大程度上再次反映了我们正在……您知道，将我们的商品运往美国。所以当我们进口它们时，我们不一定会看到我们的供应链成本高昂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> What were they spending on?
Well, they were having to spend
on supporting people.
And we also had a situation
where we had, you know,
as we came out
of the pandemic, we had huge
demand, but we had no workers.
And so companies had to pay up.
So we saw wages rise
significantly and as a result,
that fuelled an increase in
prices.
So that is the type of
spending it was.
Now when we look to what's
happening in the future,
these are investment dollars
and none of this is
going to happen quickly.
That is one of the things,
you know, if we think about
building a pipeline,
building a port, that isn't
going to happen very quickly.
So it's a gradual increase
in spending.
So it's spending in a
different way.
I guess the other thing to think
about is our supply chains and
their so far we haven't seen a
significant spike in cost,
which, you know, Canadian
companies are going to have to
pass on to consumers.
A lot of that again,
reflects this idea
that we are getting, you know,
our goods to the US.
So when we're importing them,
we're not necessarily seeing
that high, higher cost
on our supply chains.

</details>

### 加拿大房地产市场分析

**主持人**: 我想再谈谈利率。您认为今年剩余时间里利率不会从2.25%变动，但正如您所提到的，这些利率对许多人来说很重要，尤其是在住房市场方面，那些想进入市场的人，那些想续签贷款的人。但正如您所知，加拿大的市场正在软化。当我们谈论住房时，目前全国范围内给房价带来压力的主要因素是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I want to talk again about
interest rates a little bit.
You don't think it's going to
move at all from 2.25 for the
rest of the year, but these are
important, as you mentioned,
and laid out for a lot of
people with housing market,
people who are looking to enter
into the market, people who are
looking at renewing.
But as you know, the market
is softening in Canada.
When we talk about housing,
what are the main factors
that are pressuring house prices
right now across the country?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，像**多伦多**这样的市场，您知道，那里有大量的供应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> In terms of.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: **高楼，很多公寓楼**。而这些地方有很多投资者投入了资金。而且我们没有看到那种资金流继续。所以我们看到了一定程度的软化。此外，当我们考虑住房市场的整体状况时，出现了许多**负担能力问题**，对吧？我们看到房价变动非常显著，尤其是在大流行期间，因此负担能力压力不断累积。现在，它们是否处于一个情况，即事情变得更加负担得起？嗯，也许在某些市场是的，但在所有市场都不是。所以，是的，我们看到了价格修正。我们有较低的利率。这些，您知道，对负担能力有利。但在这个阶段，我们也有**不确定性因素**。所以消费者……我们真的很紧张。您看看消费者信心指标。它们……您知道，他们很紧张。那么，他们会在现阶段真的投入很多钱来买房吗？不一定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Towers, a bunch of condo
towers.
And those were a lot of
investors were putting money in
there.
And we haven't seen that
that flow continue.
So we have seen a softening.
Additionally, when we think
about overall conditions
in the housing market,
a lot of affordability issues
came up, right.
We had seen prices move so
significantly, especially
during the pandemic, and so
affordability pressures built
up.
Now, are they in a situation
now where things are
much more affordable?
Well, perhaps in some markets,
sure, but not in all markets.
And so yes, we've got price
corrections that have happened.
We have lower interest rates.
Those are, you know, good for
affordability.
But at this stage we also
have that uncertainty quotient.
And so consumers are like
we're really nervous.
You look at consumer confidence
metrics.
They're you know they're
nervous.
So are they going to really
put a lot of money down
to buy a home at this stage.
Not necessarily.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 我认为这不会持续下去。我的意思是，我认为当我们审视我们的预测，并关注可能改变消费者和企业信心的事件时，它确实是……我认为我们正朝着那个拐点迈进，届时我们将对这种关系有更多的清晰度。这可能是……您知道，乐观的想法，但……而且我认为协议不一定会完全相同。但总的来说，它将是我们能够进入我们最大的贸易伙伴的市场。这将缓解我们企业和消费者所担心的许多担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Don't think this will persist.
I mean, I think when we're
looking at our forecast and
looking at events that could
change consumer and business
confidence, it really is.
I think we're heading into that
period, that inflection point
where we're going to have some
more clarity on this
relationship.
It could be, you know,
optimistic thinking, but
and I don't think the agreement
necessarily going to look
exactly the same.
But in the main, it is going
to be that we will have access
to our largest trading partner.
And that will allay a lot of
these concerns that both
businesses and consumers have.

### 加拿大就业市场与青年失业

**主持人**: 让我们谈谈工作。在我们这次谈话的此刻，我们很遗憾还没有12月份的加拿大就业数据，但我们知道从9月到11月，加拿大增加了不到20万个工作岗位，是18万个。这些是什么类型的工作？帮助我们理解这里的人口统计特征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Let's talk jobs.
At this moment of our
conversation right now, we
don't, unfortunately, have the
Canadian job data for December,
but we know that from September
to November, Canada added
just under 200, 180,000 jobs.
What kind of jobs are these?
Help us understand the
demographics here.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，总的来说，我的意思是，我们看到那些受打击严重的行业有所改善，现在是暂时的，我认为，但尽管如此，确实有所体现。但它们处于低得多的水平。例如，在**制造业**领域，工作岗位往往是在服务业领域产生的。但当我们展望未来时，我们从公司那里听到的消息是，他们**不打算裁员**，原因有几点。一是他们知道人口结构对他们不利，所以进入劳动力市场的人不会那么多。但同时，他们也不打算增加人手。我认为这就是让消费者有点犹豫不决的原因。所以当我们审视劳动力市场时，它确实显得疲软。我们看看**职位空缺率**。所以有多少工作岗位可供失业工人选择。这已经大大下降了。您可能还记得，在大流行后，曾有数百万个工作岗位，现在已不再是这样了。所以劳动力市场确实显示出一些疲软的迹象，因为企业感到紧张。所以他们并没有真正投资于招聘新工人。现在，如果我们关于企业在2026年底感受如何的假设是正确的，那么这表明我们将开始看到一些就业增长，但我们可能不得不**忍受这种疲软的劳动力市场至少到年中**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, generally, I mean, we
have seen some improvement in
those industries that were very
badly hit now, temporary, I
think, but nonetheless, it did
show.
But they're at much lower
levels.
So in the manufacturing
sector, for example, jobs tend
to be created on the services
side of the equation.
But as we look going forward,
what we're hearing from
companies is that they're
not looking to cut their
workforce because a few
things.
One is that they know
the demographics aren't going
to be working for them, so we
won't be having as many people
come into the labour force.
But at the same time,
they're not looking to
necessarily add.
And that's what I think is
keeping a consumers a little
off balance.
So when we're looking
at the labour market, it does
seem to be soft.
We look at the vacancy rate.
So how many jobs are out there
for unemployed workers.
That's come down considerably.
As you may recall,
during the post pandemic,
millions of jobs that were out
there, that's no longer the
case.
So the labour market does
show some signs of being soft
because businesses are nervous.
And so they're not really
investing in getting new
workers.
Now, if we are correct
in our assumption about how
businesses are going to be
feeling as we even as we exit
2026, that suggests to us that
we will start to see some
employment gains, but we're
probably going to have to sit
tight with this soft labour
market at least until mid-year.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我们谈论一些大项目时……您知道，我们谈论管道，我们谈论……您需要熟练劳动力。我们这个国家在这方面有点短缺。这是否是一个问题？是否令人担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> When we talked about some of
these big projects.
You know, we talk about
pipelines, we talk about you
need skilled labour for that.
We have a bit of a shortage
in this country.
Is that playing?
Is that a concern at all?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 哦，是的。我们最近做了一项分析，说，好吧，如果一切按计划进行。我们建造更多的房屋。我们启动所有这些项目。这意味着什么？我们需要执行什么？我们确定的是，我们可能**需要额外50万熟练工人**。所以这是一个挑战。因此，对于所有这些大型政府项目，我们同意这一切都是必要的，以使我们走上更强劲的增长轨迹。但我们必须考虑到执行方面存在风险。我们需要将这些工人引进加拿大。我们是否需要利用经济中未充分利用的群体？当然，这可能有效。但我们也必须考虑到，我们可能需要**增加移民**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Oh it is.
We did a analysis recently
saying, okay, what if everything
goes according to plan.
We have more houses built.
We have all these projects get
underway.
What does that mean?
What's what do we need to
execute on that?
And what we determined
is that we probably
need half a million more
skilled workers.
And so that's a challenge.
And so with all of
these big government programs,
we agree that this is all
necessary to put us into a
stronger growth trajectory.
But we have to consider
that there is risk on
the execution side.
We need to get these workers
into Canada.
Do we have to tap underutilised
groups in the economy?
Sure, that could work.
But we also have to consider
that we may have to see
immigration rise.

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 时间也是，培训技术工人需要时间。是的。与其他省份相比，2026年的预期就业率如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Time as well, that it takes
time to train a skilled trades
workers.
Yeah.
Compare to other provinces in
terms of expected employment
rates in 2026?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，**安大略省**不幸的是，正处于风暴的中心。您知道，我们是制造业中心。所以我们看到了很大的压力。正如我所说，我们没有对汽车以及钢铁和铝材的关税**取消或至少减少**做出任何重大假设。所以这确实表明安大略省将继续落后。当我们看看我们……您知道，我们把出口运往哪里，在美国边境以南。所以是的，有些事情将一如既往，但有些事情将继续落后。现在，我猜最大的担忧，这也不是我们迄今为止看到的，就是它会**蔓延到经济的服务业**。您知道，当您看到某些社区失去大量工人时，这对他们可能使用的任何服务意味着什么？现在？我们还没有看到这方面的证据。所以，虽然我们必须注意这一点，并将其视为风险因素。但总的来说，安大略省……我想说，在我们进入2026年时，我们预计增长将比全国平均水平**温和得多**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, Ontario, unfortunately,
is sort of in the eye of the
storm.
You know, we're the
manufacturing hub.
So we are seeing a lot of
pressure.
And as I said, we haven't
made any big assumptions
about removal
or at least reduction in the
tariffs on the auto side as
well as steel and aluminium.
So that does suggest that
Ontario is going to be
continuing to lag.
And when we look at where,
you know, where do we send our
exports south of the border.
So yes, there's some things that
are going to be business as
usual, but others are going to
continue to lag.
Now, I guess the big fear,
and this isn't something
that we've seen so far,
is that it ripples out
into the services side of
the economy.
You know, when you see
certain communities losing a
lot of workers, what does that
look like in terms of any kind
of services they may be using?
Now?
We haven't seen that evidence
of that yet.
So it is something, though,
that we have to be mindful of
and keep on the risk side
of the equation.
But Ontario overall, I would
say, you know, we're looking
for more modest growth than the
national average as we go
through 2026.

### 消费者支出与储蓄率

**主持人**: 好的。让我们来谈谈我们口袋里有多少钱，或者有多少钱不在里面。您指出，2025年第三季度消费者支出有所收缩，这在衰退之外很少见。这意味着个人储蓄率上升了吗？还是人们已经精疲力尽了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right.
Let's talk about the money that
is or isn't in our pockets.
You point out that consumer
spending contracted in quarter
three of 2025, which is rare
outside of a recession.
Does that mean that personal
saving rates is up?
And or is it that people
are simply tapped out?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 当然，我们在大流行期间看到了巨额储蓄，它们已经下降了，并且再次下降。我认为当我们审视人们在花什么钱时，您知道，他们不得不支付更高的**抵押贷款**。所以这肯定会拿走一部分。我们前进的道路上可能不会看到那么快的工资增长。所以，再次强调，这意味着我们相信人们将能够偿还他们的抵押贷款，因为……再次强调，这个差距已经缩小了。所以这是好事。而且我们不期待大规模失业。所以再次强调，这是好事。但同时，您知道，当您将更多的钱用于支付抵押贷款时，例如，这确实表明储蓄率**不一定会显著上升**。绝不意味着我们会降到零，但它确实表明，它不会达到我们之前看到的那么高的水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> We had seen huge savings, of
course, during the pandemic,
and they've come down and they
have come down again.
I think when we're looking at
what people are spending on,
you know, they're having to
make these higher payments
in terms of their mortgages.
So that's certainly taking
some of it away.
We're probably not going
to see as rapid wage growth
as we move forward.
So again, it means
that people are going to
be able to, we believe, service
their mortgages because again
that gap is come down.
So that's good.
And we're not looking for
big job losses.
So again that's good.
But at the same time you know
when you do have more going
towards paying for your
mortgage, for example,
that does suggest that the
savings rates are not
necessarily going to rise
significantly.
Doesn't mean we're going to
zero by any stretch,
but it does suggest
that it's not going to see the
lofty levels we had been seeing.

### 加元汇率预测与美联储政策

**主持人**: 我想谈谈**加拿大元**。我觉得我们现在不太谈论它，因为它一直徘徊在一个我认为很多加拿大人希望看到它更高一些的水平。您预计到2026年底，加拿大元会是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I want to talk Canadian
dollar.
I feel like we don't talk
about it that much these days,
because it's been hanging
around at a point that I think
a lot of Canadians would love
to see a bit higher.
What do you expect
the Canadian dollar to be
at the end of 2026?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，我们目前的预测是大约**74.5美分**。所以比今天坚挺0.02美元。这反映了一种观点，即我们**将维持加拿大央行的利率稳定**，而美国**美联储**实际上会**降低其政策利率**。我的意思是，美国经济一直异常坚韧。他们做得如此之好真是令人惊叹，当然，在**人工智能和技术**方面进行了大量投资。这确实支撑了美国经济。但我们现在看到的是，我认为，美国劳动力市场正在略微软化。我们看到消费者方面的信心指标确实在软化。我的意思是，美国经济在消费者方面略有不同，因为您看到富裕阶层有很多支出，而许多并不那么富裕的人在支出方面确实面临困难。所以当美联储审视这些事情时，他们并没有看到美国的通胀……它有点稳定，比他们想要的要高，但它有点稳定。所以我认为从美联储的角度来看，他们现在正在关注劳动力市场。它正在……它有点疲软。而且我们知道，很大一部分人口的境况不如那些拥有大量大型投资组合的人。所以这可能意味着他们需要通过**降低利率**来解决这个问题。现在，我不认为他们会在2026年大幅降息，但会足以……它将使曲线朝有利于加拿大元的方向倾斜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, our forecast right now
is for about 74.5 cents.
So that's $0.02 firmer
than where we are today.
And it reflects a view
that we keep the Bank of
Canada rate steady.
Whereas in the US the Federal
Reserve does actually lower
their policy rate.
I mean, the US economy has been
extraordinarily resilient.
It's amazing how well they've
done lots of investment,
of course, in artificial
intelligence and technology.
And that really has bolstered
the US economy.
But what we're seeing right now,
I think, is evidence that the
labour market in the US is
softening a bit.
We're seeing measures of
confidence from the consumer
side certainly soften.
I mean, the US economy is a
little bit different in terms
of the consumer, because you
see lots of spending from the
very wealthy component and lots
of people who aren't really
that affluent, really having a
difficult time with their
spending.
So when the fed looks at these
things and they're not seeing
inflation in the US is
kind of steady, it's higher
than they want, but it's kind
of steady.
So I think from the Fed's
perspective they're now
looking at the labour market.
It's going it's a little soft.
And when we know that a large
portion of the population
aren't doing as well as the
people who are have lots of big
investment portfolios, for
example, that probably means
they're going to need to
address that through lower
interest rates.
Now, that doesn't mean
they're going to move a lot,
I don't think, in 2026,
but it will be sufficient
that it'll kind of bend that
curve in favour of the Canadian
dollar.

### 加拿大人工智能应用现状

**主持人**: 谈到人工智能。跟我谈谈我们在加拿大看到的人工智能。我们联邦有一个**人工智能部长**。那里有很多投资。我们能从中看到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Talked about AI.
Talk to me about what we see
for AI in Canada.
Here lots of we have an
AI minister federally.
There's lots of investment
there.
What can we see from that?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 嗯，关于加拿大的人工智能，当您看看**加拿大企业的人工智能采用率**时，它翻了一番。从6%上升到12%，这是好事。**加拿大统计局（Statistics Canada）**进行了一项调查，询问加拿大企业。我认为这个数字在未来12个月内有望升至17%至18%。所以这是好事。这意味着，您知道，我们可以看到更多的采用，然后它如何转化为生产力收益，在商品和服务的交付中。这……您知道，这将很有趣。我们确实相信这将产生……嗯，它究竟会如何发展？它意味着什么？我们不一定认为我们会看到大规模失业。而且我们也没有在数据中看到这一点，真的，因为它是**增强工人生产商品和服务能力的工具**。您知道，我一直觉得很有趣的一个统计数据是，看看美国公司**每名员工的投资额**，并与加拿大公司进行比较。这里的数字确实惊人。美国公司每投资一美元，给他们的工人……在加拿大是0.52美元。所以，在加拿大企业将要投资人工智能的程度上，我认为这将是一个很好的生产力提升，因为我们需要为我们的工人提供最好的工具和最好的技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, the one thing about AI
in Canada is when you look at
sort of the adoption rates by
Canadian businesses, it has
it's doubled.
It's gone from 6 to 12,
which is good.
And Statistics Canada
did a survey asking
Canadian businesses.
And that number I think is
supposed to go up to 17, 18%.
So that's good over the next
12 months.
So that means that, you know,
we can see more adoption and
then how that translates into
productivity gains in the
delivery of goods and services.
It's you know, it'll be
interesting.
We do believe that
this will generate.
Well, it's more how exactly
is it going to play out.
What's it going to mean.
We don't necessarily mean
think that we're going to see
huge job losses.
And we're not seeing
that yet in the data either,
really, because it's a
tool to augment workers ability
to produce goods and services.
You know, one thing that I find
always, like in such an
interesting statistic is
looking at how much a US
company invests per worker and
compare that to a Canadian
company.
And here the numbers
are really staggering.
For each dollar,
the US company invests
tools giving to their workers
$0.52 here in Canada.
So to the extent that
Canadian businesses
are going to invest in AI are
going, I think that's going to
be a good productivity lift
because we need to provide our
workers with the best tools and
the best technology we can.

### 经济学家的展望

**主持人**: 最后一个快速问题，因为我们不经常问首席经济学家这样的问题。您期待2026年发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> One last quick question for
you, because I don't think we
ask Chief Economist, is that
this that often?
What are you looking forward
to in 2026?

</details>

**Dawn Desjardins**: 我期待什么？您知道吗，我期待着我们看到**乐观情绪**的那一刻，因为我们都厌倦了听到“哦，这不确定。”“哦，天哪，我不知道发生了什么。”我认为我们正处于一个许多事情正在发生的节点。它们正在发生，但**基础正在构建**。我们只需要达到那个水平，我们就能开始看到。所以，我想对我来说，我将密切关注这一点，就是看到**商业情绪的转变**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> What am I looking forward to?
You know what, I'm looking
forward to that moment where
we are seeing optimism, because
we're all a little bit tired of
hearing, oh, it's uncertain.
And oh my goodness, I don't
know what's going on.
I do think that we are sort of
at that point where lots of
things are happening.
They're happening,
but the blocks are building.
We just need to get to that
level where we can
start to see.
So I think for me,
and I'll be watching this
keenly, is just seeing that
turn in terms of business
sentiment.

</details>

**主持人**: Dawn，我们就谈到这里。非常感谢您。非常感谢。

### 深入分析：加拿大青年失业率

**主持人**: 如果您认识15到24岁之间的人，或者您自己就在这个年龄段，您可能知道这里的就业市场相当严峻。为什么这个国家的年轻人现在找工作如此困难？Deep Dixit 将剖析加拿大高青年失业率的原因和影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

If you know someone aged 15 to
24 or are somewhat between 15
and 24, you probably know the
job market is pretty grim.
Why is it so hard
for young people to get hired
in this country right now?
Unravels a deep Dixit breaks
down the causes and effects
of Canada's high youth
unemployment rate.

</details>

**专家**: 当我看到年轻、健康的求职者，他们打电话给我说找不到工作时，我真是受不了。我向您保证，如果您努力寻找，您一定会找到工作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> It drives me nuts when I see
young, healthy people and
they'll call me up saying
I can't find a job.
I can assure you,
if you look hard enough,
you'll find a job.

</details>

**主持人**: 说起来容易做起来难，因为在经济疲软时很难找到工作。如果您是那些在15至24岁之间、努力找工作却屡屡碰壁的年轻人之一，您绝非孤例。过去一年，**青年失业率一直保持在10%以上**。这几乎是该国其他所有年龄段失业率的两倍。这不仅仅是一个短期问题，除了需要维持生计，职业生涯早期找不到工作会对长期产生深远影响。您更有可能错过积累技能、建立职业人脉以及在职业生涯早期晋升的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> That's easier said than done,
because it's hard to find work
in a sluggish economy.
And if you're one of
those young people
between 15 and 24 struggling
to land a job,
you're far from alone.
Over the last year, the youth
unemployment rate has stayed
above 10%.
That's nearly double
the unemployment rate of every
other age group in the country.
And this isn't just a short
term problem beyond needing to
afford to live, not finding
work at the start of your
career can have long lasting
effects.
You're more likely to miss
out on building skills,
growing professional networks,
and moving up early in your
career.

</details>

**年轻人**: 加油，兄弟。向上！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> You got this, bro.
Move up.

</details>

**主持人**: 即使年轻人在经济不景气时找到工作，通常薪水也较低。研究表明，在这样的时期进入劳动力市场可能会**导致年收入减少高达9%**，这些损失可能需要长达十年才能弥补。那么，我们是如何导致如此高的青年失业率的呢？这是几种重叠压力的结果。经济不确定性和贸易紧张局势导致企业招聘放缓，而当有工作机会时，年轻工人常常要与可能失业的经验丰富的员工竞争。与此同时，**入门级职位的数量有所下降**，许多经济学家将这一转变与**自动化和人工智能**联系起来。过去几年的高移民水平也增加了对这些入门级职位的竞争，尽管移民继续支持整体经济增长。我们曾见过青年失业率达到类似水平。在大流行期间，在2009年金融危机之后，以及在90年代中期，都是经济衰退时期。尽管加拿大目前技术上并未处于衰退之中。那么，我们该如何摆脱困境呢？其中一部分取决于政策，而这个过程已经开始。联邦政府已**降低了移民目标**。加拿大央行已**降低了利率**，国内支出在旅游、餐馆和现场娱乐等行业有所增加，这些行业是年轻人经常找到工作的地方。但这些措施需要时间。不会一蹴而就。与此同时，年轻人被要求在疲软的就业市场中导航，并承受他们并未创造的经济的长期后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And even when young people
do find work in a depressed
economy, it's often at a lower
salary.
Research shows entering
the workforce during periods
like this can reduce annual
earnings up to 9%, losses that
can take as long as a decade to
recover.
So how do we end up with
such high youth unemployment?
It's the result of several
overlapping pressures.
Economic uncertainty
and trade tensions have made
businesses slower to hire, and
when jobs are available, young
workers are often competing
with more experienced employees
who may have lost theirs.
At the same time, the number of
entry level positions has
declined, a shift that many
economists linked to automation
and AI.
High immigration levels over
the past several years have
also increased competition
for those entry level jobs,
even as immigration continues
to support overall economic
growth.
We've seen youth unemployment
reach similar levels before.
During the pandemic, after
the 2009 financial crisis,
and in the mid '90s, all
periods of economic recession.
Even though Canada isn't
technically in one right now.
So how do we get out of
this?
Some of it depends on policy,
and that process has already
started.
The federal government has
reduced immigration targets.
The Bank of Canada has
lowered interest rates,
and domestic spending
has picked up in sectors like
travel, restaurants and live
entertainment industries, where
young people often find work.
But these measures take time.
It's not going to happen
overnight.
In the meantime, young people
are being asked to navigate
a weak job market and absorb
the long term consequences
of an economy they didn't
create.

### 新工作室揭秘

**主持人**: 我喜欢我们新沙发，新地板，还有我们从地板到天花板的书架。我非常欣赏这个新工作室的很多地方，包括那些把它建好的人。下面是关于建造这个美丽空间的过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I love our new couch, our

ceiling bookcase.
I appreciate so much about this
new studio, including the people
who put it together.
Here's a look at what it took
to build this beautiful space.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，您可能已经注意到我们身处不同的环境。我们换过几次工作室。这是我们开场白（cold open）的地点。所以每集我们都从这里开始，就在我的办公室。我们有我们的书，我们有那边的摄像师，Ricardo。我们介绍当天的议题和头条新闻。我们仍然在楼上的一个会议室拍摄，作为我们的主工作室。但我们希望在接下来的几周内，我们主楼层的工作室就能完工，那将是我们的新家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Sir.
>> All right, so you probably
noticed we are in a different
setting.
We've changed studios a couple

This is the location for our
cold open.
So every episode we start off
here right in my office.
We've got our books,
we've got our camera operator
there, Ricardo.
And we introduce our topics
and our headlines for the day.
And we're still filming
in a boardroom upstairs
as our main studio.
But we're hoping in the
next couple of weeks that our
studio on the main floor will
be done and that will be our
new home.

</details>

**设计师**: 然后这个家伙放在上面，然后……所以我们应该有两个这样的。我叫Kathleen Black，是**TVO**的高级布景道具和服装设计师。我是The Rundown的制作设计师。我开始设计布景。就像在剧院一样，这非常不同。通常当你想到广播时，你会想到一个巨大、闪亮、全新的布景。而在这个案例中，我有点想到了我们的主持人Jeyan，想着如果我们在Jeyan的客厅里，会是什么样子？这开始激发我的想象，工作室的基调会是什么样的。我们需要为The Rundown以及播客空间腾出地方。因为我们有很多视频播客。我们当然还有“Big, if True”，这是我们的另一个广播节目，然后我们工作室里还有一个绿屏，孩子们和TVO Learn经常在那里拍摄。所以我们必须有一种方法来……当不想看到它时，可以将其遮蔽起来。一些关键的特点是**声学面板**。我们不想为我们是工作室而道歉，所以我们实际上将它们用作设计特色。我们有一个巨大、漂亮的**书架**，一个有点像窗户的特色，还有一个**单显示器**，大多数时候看起来会像一件艺术品，然后您需要与制片人以及您的灯光设计师和您的施工团队来回沟通。我喜欢去车间，因为事情正在进行。很忙。有木屑飞扬，这意味着布景道具正在变得生动起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And then this guy goes on
top and then.
So we should have two of these.
My name is Kathleen Black
and I'm the senior set prop
and wardrobe designer at TVO.
And I'm the production designer
on The Rundown.
So I started designing sets.
As in theatre, this is very
different.
Usually when you think of
broadcast, you think big,
shiny, new set.
And in this case,
I sort of thought about
our host Jeyan and thought
if we were in Jeyan's living
room, what would it look like?
And that started to pique
my imagination of what the tone
of the set would be within our
studio.
We needed to make room
for The Rundown as well as a
podcast space.
Because we have a lot of
video podcasts.
We of course have
Big, if True, which
is another one of our broadcast
shows, and then we also have a
green screen in our studio,
which is where kids and TVO
learn often shoots.
So we had to have a way
to sort of mask that
when we don't want to see it.
Some of the key features are
acoustic panelling.
We didn't want to apologise that
we're a studio, so we actually
used them as a design feature.
We have a big, beautiful
bookshelf, a bit of a window
feature and a single monitor
which will look like a piece of
art most times, and then you're
going back and forth with the
producers as well as your
lighting designer and your
construction team.
I love going to the shelf
because things are getting done.
It is busy.
There's sawdust flying, and it
means that set pieces are
coming to life.

**协调员**: 是的，受保护。您知道我的意思吗？然后……然后。我们在这里把它组装起来。我们的**截止日期非常紧张**，所以我们在现场外工作，而其他人则准备工作室。我们同时做很多事情。这很辛苦，但我们准备好了。我们已经准备好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Yes, protected.
>> You know what I mean?
And then when and then.
And we'll put it together here.
We're on a very tight
deadline, so we're working
off-site while other people
make the studio ready.
We're doing lots of things at
once.
It's a lot and we're ready.
We're up for it.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以当你进去时，每个人都在工作。每个人都有任务要做，而且他们的任务通常非常不同。有油漆团队，有木工团队。这是我们在做的。这里是The Rundown布景的景象，这里的窗帘，以及这些漂亮的工作室门。向我们的设计师Kathleen Black致敬。她太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

### 创伤对大脑发育的影响

**主持人**: 即将在The Rundown播出。当您经历创伤事件，尤其是重复性创伤事件时，特别是当它来自您亲近的人，如照料者、父母等。它会造成我所说的**级联事件**。您点燃了一整套生物事件，这些事件会级联，导致您的大脑发育偏离轨迹。与25岁未经历过创伤的人相比，您25岁时的大脑确实不同。我们可以追溯到创伤造成的**异常应激反应**的影响，这种反应在短期内拯救了您。您看到压力，应激反应……它们在短期内拯救我们。它们让我们度过压力源，但它们会留下一点……可以说是“友军误伤”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Coming up on The Rundown.
>> When you have a trauma event,
especially when it's a
repetitive trauma event,
especially when it's from
people who are close to you
caretakers, parents, and so on.
It creates what I call a
cascade event.
You've ignited a whole set
of biological events
that cascade, causing an off
trajectory development of your
brain.
Your brain is literally
different at age 25 when
compared to someone who's 25
who didn't have trauma.
And we can trace it
back to the effect of
the abnormal stress response
created by the trauma that
saved you in the short term.
You see stress, stress
responses, Eric.
They save us
in the near term.
They get us
past the stressor, but they

fire, so to speak.
