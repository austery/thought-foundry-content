title: 特朗普中东和平协议、中美贸易紧张与欧洲AI独立性
---
### 播客引言与今日头条

This is the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast. Good morning. It's Tuesday the 14th of October. I'm Steven Carowell in Brussels.
这是彭博欧洲日出播客。早上好。今天是10月14日星期二。我是史蒂文·卡罗威尔，在布鲁塞尔为您播报。

Coming up today, Donald Trump signs his Gaza truce deal to international acclaim, but establishing a lasting peace in the Middle East still looks difficult.
今天我们将关注，唐纳德·特朗普签署了他的加沙停火协议，获得了国际赞誉，但要在中东建立持久和平仍面临困难。

The US and China ratchet up trade tensions with tit-for-tat measures targeting the shipping industry.
美国和中国以针锋相对的措施，针对航运业加剧了贸易紧张局势。

Plus playing catchup on AI, Europe striving to claim a piece of the global tech boom, but remains dependent on American firms like Nvidia and OpenAI.
此外，欧洲正在努力追赶人工智能，力求在全球科技热潮中占据一席之地，但仍依赖英伟达和OpenAI等美国公司。

Let's start with a roundup of our top stories.
让我们从头条新闻综述开始。

### 加沙停火协议与人质释放

World leaders signed a Gaza ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump who hailed it as the historic dawn of a new Middle East.
世界各国领导人签署了由美国总统唐纳德·特朗普斡旋的加沙停火协议，特朗普称之为“新中东的历史性曙光”。

There were emotional scenes in Israel where families were reunited with hostages who were taken by Hamas during its October 7th attack two years ago.
以色列出现了感人的一幕幕，被哈马斯在两年前10月7日袭击中劫持的人质与家人团聚。

Their release, along with the freeing of Palestinian prisoners, marks the successful first phase of the US plan to end the war.
这些人质的获释，以及巴勒斯坦囚犯的释放，标志着美国结束战争计划的第一阶段成功完成。

President Trump described it as an achievement 3,000 years in the making.
特朗普总统将其描述为一项“酝酿了3000年的成就”。

"For so many families across this land, it has been years since you've known a single day of true peace. But now at last Israelis, but also for Palestinians and for many others, the long and painful nightmare is finally over."
“对于这片土地上的许多家庭来说，多年来他们从未有过一天真正的和平。但现在，对于以色列人、巴勒斯坦人以及许多其他人来说，漫长而痛苦的噩梦终于结束了。”

Even Trump's critics and political opponents agreed he had succeeded where others had failed, although some questioned his rhetoric.
即使是特朗普的批评者和政治对手也承认，他在他人失败的地方取得了成功，尽管有些人质疑他的言辞。

### 中东和平的长期挑战

Many others still have concerns about how the plan will work out in the long term.
许多人仍然担心该计划的长期效果。

Officials have yet to lay out a clear plan for disarming Hamas or how to fund the colossal task of rebuilding Gaza.
官员们尚未制定出解除哈马斯武装的明确计划，也未说明如何为重建加沙的艰巨任务提供资金。

There are also questions over who will run the territory which is home to 2.2 million people almost all of whom have been displaced by the war.
关于谁将管理这片土地也存在疑问，该地区是220万人口的家园，其中几乎所有人都因战争而流离失所。

### 中美贸易紧张局势升级

China has imposed curbs on five units of Hanoa Ocean in response to US probes against Chinese maritime logistics and ship building.
中国针对美国对中国海运物流和造船业的调查，对“Hanoa Ocean”的五个部门实施了限制。

That's according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
这是根据中国商务部的一份声明。

It's the latest escalation between the two countries as they try to claim they are winning their trade war.
这是两国之间最新的升级，双方都声称自己正在赢得贸易战。

Both countries now say the ball is in the other's court to compromise.
两国现在都表示，妥协的球在对方的半场。

Speaking yesterday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant says his administration won't back down.
美国财政部长斯科特·贝桑特昨天表示，他的政府不会退缩。

"This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world and we're not going to have it."
“这是中国与世界的对抗。他们用火箭筒瞄准了整个自由世界的供应链和工业基础，我们不会容忍。”

Scott Bessant speaking there despite his stance.
斯科特·贝桑特在那里发表了讲话，尽管他立场坚定。

He also said he believes a planned Trump Xi meeting will still be on, noting substantial communication over the weekend.
他还表示，他相信计划中的特朗普与习近平会晤仍将举行，并指出周末双方进行了实质性沟通。

### 全球经济与贸易展望

Elsewhere, smaller economies are adapting to a world where US consumers and companies are costlier to reach by seeking buyers in Asia, Europe, and Africa.
在其他地方，较小的经济体正在适应一个美国消费者和公司更难触及的世界，它们正通过在亚洲、欧洲和非洲寻找买家来适应。

The **World Trade Organization** (WTO: 旨在促进全球贸易自由化的国际组织) has revised its forecast for merchandise trade growth in 2025 from 0.9% to 2.4% as governments redraw alliances.
随着各国政府重新调整联盟，**世界贸易组织** (WTO: 旨在促进全球贸易自由化的国际组织) 已将其对2025年商品贸易增长的预测从0.9%上调至2.4%。

### 美联储利率政策观点

The Philadelphia Fed President Hannah Pollson has signaled she's in favor of two more quarter point interest rate cuts this year.
费城联储主席汉娜·波尔森表示，她支持今年再进行两次25个基点的降息。

Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual conference, the policy maker said she doesn't see conditions that would turn tariff induced price increases into sustained inflation.
这位政策制定者在全国商业经济学协会年会上表示，她认为没有条件会导致关税引发的价格上涨演变为持续性通胀。

My base case is that tariffs will increase the price level but they won't leave a lasting imprint on inflation. And given this base case, monetary policy should look through tariff effects on prices. Why? Let me start with the economics here. The lessons from economic theory are clear. So long as expectations are anchored, increases in prices due to supply effects do not turn into an inflation problem.
我的基本判断是，关税会提高物价水平，但不会对通胀留下持久影响。鉴于此，货币政策应忽略关税对物价的影响。为什么？让我从经济学角度解释。经济理论的教训很清楚：只要通胀预期稳定，由供应效应导致的价格上涨就不会演变为通胀问题。

The Fed's Anna Pollson speaking there.
那是美联储的安娜·波尔森的讲话。

She went on to say the policy makers decision to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last month made sense.
她接着说，政策制定者上个月将利率下调25个基点的决定是合理的。

Though a narrow majority of **FOMC** (Federal Open Market Committee: 美国联邦储备系统内负责制定货币政策的委员会) members favor at least two more cuts this year, others have argued for a cautious approach as inflation remains above their 2% goal.
尽管**联邦公开市场委员会** (FOMC: 美国联邦储备系统内负责制定货币政策的委员会) 成员中略微多数人支持今年至少再降息两次，但其他人主张采取谨慎态度，因为通胀仍高于他们2%的目标。

### 英国经济面临挑战

Bank of England policy maker Katherine Mann says Brexit and Liz Truss have made the UK a less competitive and slower growing economy.
英格兰银行政策制定者凯瑟琳·曼恩表示，英国脱欧和莉兹·特拉斯的政策使英国经济的竞争力下降，增长放缓。

Speaking at a conference in Philadelphia, the central banker said the UK's vote to leave the European Union was one step in a long erosion of sterling as a global currency.
这位央行官员在费城的一次会议上表示，英国投票脱离欧盟是英镑作为全球货币长期受到侵蚀的一个步骤。

She added that the implications of Brexit meant the supply side of the economy for the UK is a real challenge.
她补充说，英国脱欧的影响意味着英国经济的“供应侧”面临真正的挑战。

Mann had voted to hold interest rates at the last two **BOE** (Bank of England: 英格兰银行，英国的中央银行) meetings in an effort to shrink inflation which at 3.8% is almost double the bank's 2% target.
曼恩在**英格兰银行** (BOE: 英格兰银行，英国的中央银行) 最近两次会议上都投票支持维持利率不变，以期抑制通胀，目前通胀率达3.8%，几乎是该行2%目标的两倍。

### 贵金属市场创历史新高

Silver prices have reached an all-time high as traders drive a supply shortage.
由于交易员推高供应短缺，白银价格已达到历史新高。

Spot prices for the precious metal traded near $53 an ounce, beating a record set in the 1980s.
这种贵金属的现货价格交易接近每盎司53美元，打破了1980年代创下的纪录。

Concerns about a lack of liquidity in London have led some traders to fly bars across the Atlantic to profit from higher prices.
对伦敦流动性不足的担忧，导致一些交易员将银条空运过大西洋，以从更高的价格中获利。

The squeeze comes as investors globally look for safe havens with gold also climbing to another record high, building on eight straight weeks of gains.
此次挤压是在全球投资者寻求避险资产的背景下发生的，黄金也攀升至另一个历史新高，此前已连续八周上涨。

### SpaceX星舰成功发射

And SpaceX's Starship successfully lifted off for space on Monday in a closely watched test of its ability to deploy satellites and return to Earth intact.
周一，SpaceX的星舰成功升空，进行了一次备受关注的测试，以验证其部署卫星并完好返回地球的能力。

The rocket, billed as the largest and most powerful ever built, completed earlier milestones critical to CEO Elon Musk's aim of preparing it for regular missions into orbit and beyond.
这枚被誉为有史以来最大、最强大的火箭，完成了对首席执行官埃隆·马斯克而言至关重要的早期里程碑，旨在为将其准备用于常规轨道及更远的任务。

Let's take a listen to the moment it launched from the Starbase facility in South Texas.
让我们听听它在南德克萨斯州星际基地发射的那一刻。

"3, 2, 1. We have liftoff. Go Super Heavy. Go Starship. Thanks for all the historic flights, bad one."
“3，2，1。发射！超级重型火箭，冲！星舰，冲！感谢所有历史性的飞行，糟糕的那个。”

Minutes later, the Starship Superheavy booster split from the spacecraft as planned before splashing down at the Gulf of Mexico.
几分钟后，星舰的“超级重型”助推器按计划与飞船分离，随后溅落在墨西哥湾。

The success marks a step forward in Musk's ambitions to carry NASA astronauts to the moon in under two years and eventually establish civilization on Mars.
这次成功标志着马斯克雄心壮志向前迈进了一步，他计划在两年内将美国国家航空航天局的宇航员送上月球，并最终在火星上建立文明。

### 市场动态与加密货币震荡

Well, those are your top stories. On the markets, we're looking at European stock futures lower 210 and Euro stocks 50 this morning.
好了，以上是我们的头条新闻。在市场方面，我们看到欧洲股指期货下跌210点，欧洲斯托克50指数今早也下跌。

The Nikkei in Tokyo down by 2.6%, the Topix down by 2.2% those markets catching up after being closed yesterday.
东京的日经指数下跌2.6%，东证指数下跌2.2%，这些市场在昨天休市后正在追赶。

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down by 1% as well.
香港的恒生指数也下跌了1%。

So trade movements there having some effect on markets.
因此，那里的贸易动向对市场产生了一些影响。

Gold and silver we've been telling you about both significantly rallying today.
我们一直在告诉您的黄金和白银今天都大幅上涨。

Gold's up 1.6%. Silver's up 1.9% as well.
黄金上涨1.6%。白银也上涨1.9%。

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot index a tenth of 1% weaker and stock futures on Wall Street at the moment are lower to 410 lower for S&P E-Mini futures.
彭博美元现货指数下跌0.1%，华尔街的股指期货目前也走低，标普E-Mini期货下跌410点。

In a moment, we'll bring you more on events in the Middle East.
稍后，我们将为您带来更多中东事件的报道。

Plus, can Europe catch up in the **AI** (Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的科学与工程) race?
另外，欧洲能在**人工智能** (AI: 模拟人类智能的科学与工程) 竞赛中迎头赶上吗？

But another story that I've been reading this morning about how the crash in cryptocurrencies played out over the weekend.
但今天早上我还读到另一篇关于加密货币周末暴跌的文章。

So, some of those US China trade headlines on Friday, sparking a sell-off across many asset classes.
因此，周五的一些中美贸易头条新闻引发了许多资产类别的抛售。

But, Bitcoin plunged around 13% after those tensions spiked.
然而，在这些紧张局势加剧后，比特币暴跌了约13%。

Bloomberg's Alga Karif though has been writing about how the slump was much steeper in the **altcoin** (Alternative Coin: 任何比特币以外的加密货币) market which are these as she described them ecosystems of speculative tokens that have promised generational wealth through viral memes, big name branding and blind faith in momentum.
不过，彭博社的阿尔加·卡里夫一直在撰文，描述**山寨币** (altcoin: 任何比特币以外的加密货币) 市场的跌幅更为剧烈，她将其描述为通过病毒式迷因、大品牌营销和对势头的盲目信任来承诺创造世代财富的投机性代币生态系统。

Well, it seems that blind faith wasn't very well placed when we look at the 131 billion in value erased from those altcoins.
然而，当我们看到这些山寨币蒸发了1310亿美元的价值时，这种盲目信任似乎并没有得到很好的回报。

That's according to 10x research.
这是根据10x研究公司的数据。

Now this is a sector built on thinner than liquidity, speculative narratives and hype.
现在，这是一个建立在流动性稀薄、投机性叙事和炒作之上的领域。

So it is more vulnerable to bigger swings.
因此，它更容易受到更大的波动影响。

But August writing that the crash raises doubts about the future of this whole ecosystem.
但奥古斯特撰文称，此次崩盘引发了人们对整个生态系统未来的疑虑。

Traders and market makers see structural support for these tokens now eroding with fewer buyers and rising risk aversion.
交易员和做市商认为，随着买家减少和避险情绪上升，这些代币的结构性支撑正在被侵蚀。

Could this be a freeze for niche meme coins like Dogecoin?
这是否意味着像狗狗币这样的利基迷因币将面临停滞？

You can read August full at bloomberg.com and we'll put a link to it in our podcast show notes.
你可以在bloomberg.com上阅读奥古斯特的完整文章，我们也会在播客节目说明中附上链接。

### 加沙和平进程的下一步

Steven Carowell: To the Middle East now where US President Donald Trump talked about a new beginning for the region after the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners under the US brokered ceasefire yesterday. Our head of Middle East and North Africa coverage, Stuart Livingston Wallace, joins me now for more. Stuart, let's start first of all with how yesterday went. Was this a big success for Donald Trump?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 现在我们转向中东，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普昨天在中美斡旋的停火协议下，以色列人质和巴勒斯坦囚犯获释后，谈到了该地区的新开端。我们中东和北非报道的负责人，斯图尔特·利文斯顿·华莱士现在加入我们，带来更多信息。斯图尔特，我们首先从昨天的情况开始。这对唐纳德·特朗普来说是一次巨大的成功吗？

Stuart: Yeah, I think it was. And I think it would be mean-spirited to say otherwise.
斯图尔特: 是的，我认为是的。我认为如果说不是，那会显得很刻薄。

And if you think about what he achieved that certainly his predecessor and many other international leaders had failed to achieve over a couple of years which was ultimately the release of the hostages and also the release of a couple of thousand Palestinian detainees and prisoners.
如果你想想他所取得的成就，这无疑是他的前任以及许多其他国际领导人在过去几年中未能实现的，最终是人质的释放，以及数千名巴勒斯坦被拘留者和囚犯的释放。

So just in terms of the human impact it was a really big day I think, and particularly for the region and then to get that many leaders, and I'm referring of course to the summit in Sha Mashik, into a room at short notice I think speaks volumes to how consequential those actions have been.
因此，仅仅从人道影响来看，我认为这是非常重要的一天，特别是对该地区而言。而且，能在如此短的时间内召集这么多领导人——我当然指的是在沙马希克举行的峰会——齐聚一堂，这充分说明了这些行动的重要性。

Steven Carowell: Of course the signing was the big moment but what sort of plans emerged from that summit in Egypt about what happens next in Gaza?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 当然，签署协议是重要时刻，但埃及峰会就加沙下一步行动达成了哪些计划呢？

Stuart: Yeah, I mean I think you can look at this two ways. I mean I think you can look at it as a reminder that there is an awfully long way to go to getting true peace particularly in Gaza, but I would argue arguably across the Middle East.
斯图尔特: 是的，我认为你可以从两个角度来看待这个问题。我认为你可以将其视为一个提醒，即要实现真正的和平，尤其是在加沙，还有很长的路要走，而且可以说整个中东地区都是如此。

But on the other hand, you can view it as again summoning and successfully summoning that many leaders from around the world at short notice shows a degree of goodwill and that will be absolutely essential in terms of hammering out the details of what Gaza looks like going forward.
但另一方面，你可以将其视为又一次在短时间内成功召集了世界各地如此多的领导人，这显示出一定程度的善意，这对于制定加沙未来的具体方案，包括重建以及由谁来支付费用、由谁提供人员来监督和执行停火，以及最终由谁参与制定加沙未来可信的治理计划，都将是绝对必要的。

both in terms of the reconstruction and who's going to pay for it, who's going to provide personnel to monitor ceasefires and then to implement them. And then finally, who's going to be involved in formulating a credible governance plan for Gaza going forward.
包括重建方面，以及谁来支付费用，谁来提供人员监督和执行停火协议。最后，谁将参与制定加沙未来的可信治理计划。

Steven Carowell: In the immediate, what should we be expecting next in this process?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 那么，在这个过程中，我们近期应该期待什么？

Stuart: So to some extent now the hard work begins because it really is a question of hammering out exactly who is going to take responsibility for what because I think no one with who's been observing things over the last couple of years would argue that Heras is in any position to resume governance.
斯图尔特: 因此，在某种程度上，现在真正的困难才开始，因为这确实是一个需要明确谁将承担什么责任的问题。我认为，在过去几年里一直在观察局势的人，没有人会认为哈拉斯有能力恢复治理。

Although there have been early indications that they have been trying to reassert control but I think that's a non-starter for just about everyone.
尽管早有迹象表明他们一直在试图重新确立控制权，但我认为这对几乎所有人来说都是行不通的。

So that probably means some sort of international coalition over the short term, a technocratic government of some sort, hopefully with a strong Palestinian flavor, a reform of the Palestinian Authority.
因此，这可能意味着短期内某种形式的国际联盟，一种技术官僚政府，希望带有浓厚的巴勒斯坦色彩，以及巴勒斯坦权力机构的改革。

And then as you rebuild those institutions across the enclave you try and find a way of linking it up with the West Bank and you try and find a way of bringing or returning economic prosperity because I think that is the key here is it needs a functioning infrastructure and it needs a functioning economy for this to be viable in any sort of time frame.
然后，当你重建飞地内的这些机构时，你试图找到一种将其与约旦河西岸连接起来的方式，并试图找到一种带来或恢复经济繁荣的方式，因为我认为这里的关键是，它需要一个正常运作的基础设施和正常运作的经济，才能在任何时间框架内可行。

### 内塔尼亚胡的政治前景

Steven Carowell: What does all of this mean for Benjamin Netanyahu? Will he be able to keep a focus on security issues given the other controversies that he has faced in his leadership?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 所有这一切对本雅明·内塔尼亚胡意味着什么？鉴于他在领导期间面临的其他争议，他还能否继续专注于安全问题？

Stuart: Yeah, I mean that's an extremely good question and to some extent the landscape has shifted.
斯图尔特: 是的，我认为这是一个非常好的问题，而且在某种程度上，局面已经发生了变化。

I mean you can point to a couple of things. There was that somewhat but it would appear off the cuff remark from Trump yesterday in the Kasset where he urged the Israeli president to pardon BB in relation to the trials that he's currently going under.
我的意思是，你可以指出几件事。昨天特朗普在国会发表了那番似乎是即兴的言论，他敦促以色列总统赦免正在受审的内塔尼亚胡。

We'll see whether that happens. I mean, it's not entirely unprecedented, but it would be extremely unusual.
我们将拭目以待这是否会发生。我的意思是，这并非完全没有先例，但会极其不寻常。

That would remove at least some of the pressure on him.
那至少会减轻他的一些压力。

And then it'd be interesting to see what happens at the electoral level.
然后，在选举层面会发生什么将非常有趣。

I mean, up until probably a couple of weeks ago, I think it would be very difficult for Netanyahu to secure a win in a future election, which has to take place by October.
我的意思是，大概直到几周前，我认为内塔尼亚胡在未来必须在10月前举行的选举中获胜将非常困难。

But you do wonder with the release of the hostages and the seeming peace, at least for now, in Gaza, whether his electoral fortunes might turn around.
但你确实会想，随着人质的释放以及加沙目前看似的和平，他的选举命运是否会好转。

And more importantly whether he would have to rely on that sort of hard right members of his coalition to form a government going forward.
更重要的是，他是否必须依赖其联盟中的那些强硬右翼成员来组建未来的政府。

So I think something we're going to be watching over the next few months very hard to predict which way it'll go but his fortunes seem marginally better than they were until really quite recently.
因此，我认为在接下来的几个月里，我们将密切关注一些事情，虽然很难预测走向，但他的境况似乎比最近之前略有好转。

Steven Carowell: Okay, Stuart Livingston Wallace who heads up our coverage of the Middle East and North Africa. Thank you very much for joining us. Stay with us. More from Bloomberg Daybreak Europe coming up after this.
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 好的，斯图尔特·利文斯顿·华莱士，他负责我们中东和北非的报道。非常感谢您的加入。请继续收听，稍后将有更多来自彭博欧洲日出的内容。

### 欧洲AI独立性的困境

Now, European companies are striving to claim a piece of the global AI boom, but they remain dependent on American firms like Nvidia and OpenAI.
现在，欧洲公司正在努力在全球人工智能热潮中分一杯羹，但它们仍然依赖英伟达和OpenAI等美国公司。

Across the continent, there are fears that a failure to invest heavily in AI locally will mean losing talent and abandoning yet another tech revolution to Silicon Valley.
整个欧洲大陆都担心，如果未能对本地人工智能进行大量投资，将意味着人才流失，并将又一场技术革命拱手让给硅谷。

Our AI reporter Rachel Mets has been writing about this and she joins us now for more.
我们的人工智能记者雷切尔·梅茨一直在撰写相关报道，她现在加入我们，带来更多信息。

Steven Carowell: Rachel, good to talk to you. What did you hear then about these fears from European policy makers and executives?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 雷切尔，很高兴与你交谈。你从欧洲政策制定者和高管那里听到了哪些关于这些担忧的信息？

Rachel: I think a lot of people are concerned that as we've seen in the past there have been case after case where in Europe technology revolutions have come and they have gone and the continent and the individual countries just have not really been in charge of their destinies with these technologies.
雷切尔: 我认为很多人担心，正如我们过去所看到的，欧洲多次出现技术革命，但这些革命来来去去，而欧洲大陆和各个国家并没有真正掌控自己在这些技术上的命运。

We've seen that with mobile with cloud etc.
我们在移动技术、云计算等方面都看到了这种情况。

And with AI, I think people really want to be in charge, especially because they see it as a technology that will play into a lot of different industries and could have a lot of different impacts.
而对于人工智能，我认为人们确实希望掌握主动权，特别是因为他们将其视为一种将影响许多不同行业并可能产生许多不同影响的技术。

It could be, it's necessary for things like healthcare.
它可能是，对于医疗保健等领域来说是必要的。

It could be used in defense, things like that.
它可能用于国防等领域。

Especially, when you're talking about things that are really sensitive data wise, you want to have more control over them as a country.
特别是，当你谈论那些数据敏感性很高的事情时，作为一个国家，你希望对它们拥有更多的控制权。

### 欧洲AI投资与人才流失的担忧

Steven Carowell: Is this a lack of investment that's the source of this or is it just simply that the drivers of innovation in AI are just concentrated in Silicon Valley?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 这是否是投资不足造成的，还是仅仅因为人工智能创新的驱动力集中在硅谷？

Rachel: I think there's a few different things going on and our reporting seemed to indicate that there are a bunch of different factors here.
雷切尔: 我认为有几个不同的因素正在发挥作用，我们的报道似乎表明这里存在多种因素。

You definitely have a lot of people that are in Silicon Valley, but there's plenty of talent in Europe, in France, in Germany, in the UK, in many other countries as well.
硅谷确实有很多人才，但欧洲、法国、德国、英国以及许多其他国家也有大量人才。

And I think a lot of companies are saying, "Hey, we want to make sure we keep these smart people that we have here."
而且我认为很多公司都在说：“嘿，我们想确保留住我们这里的这些聪明人。”

They have people going through their universities and they want to keep them there, find ways to keep them there.
他们有来自大学的人才，他们希望将这些人留在这里，并找到方法留住他们。

Find ways to make it attractive for people to build companies there.
找到方法让人们乐于在那里创办公司。

And there is definitely investment, but it's true that it is a fraction of what companies collectively in the US are investing.
而且肯定有投资，但确实，这只是美国公司集体投资的一小部分。

But it's still not an insignificant amount of money that they are investing in AI.
但他们对人工智能的投资仍然不是一个小数目。

### 实现AI主权的挑战与现实

Steven Carowell: This reporting Rachel will cause a lot of hand ringing in Brussels where I am but really in many parts of Europe as well that Europe wants to avoid becoming a tech colony. Can Europe catch up in this or is it too late already?
史蒂文·卡罗威尔: 雷切尔，这份报道会在我所在的布鲁塞尔以及欧洲许多地方引起广泛担忧，欧洲希望避免成为一个科技殖民地。欧洲能迎头赶上吗，还是已经太晚了？

Rachel: I think that there's a lot of work still to be done is what it seems like we were finding in our reporting.
雷切尔: 我认为，根据我们的报道发现，仍有大量工作需要完成。

There is as you mentioned investment. There's still a lot of money that needs to be invested and there's also I think a lot of thinking that needs to be done about what are the goals here and what does it mean to have **sovereign AI** (主权人工智能: 指一个国家或地区能够自主控制、开发和部署人工智能技术的能力).
正如你提到的，投资是存在的。仍有大量资金需要投入，而且我认为还需要进行大量的思考，明确这里的目标是什么，以及拥有**主权人工智能** (sovereign AI: 指一个国家或地区能够自主控制、开发和部署人工智能技术的能力) 意味着什么。

I think one of the first questions we asked each person we interviewed was what does sovereign AI mean to you?
我认为我们采访的每个人，我们首先提出的问题之一就是：主权人工智能对你意味着什么？

And it's kind of a squishy term that seems to have a lot to do with control over the sort of start to finish process of AI and of chips and of cloud services and of the models themselves.
这是一个有点模糊的术语，似乎与对人工智能、芯片、云服务以及模型本身从开始到结束的整个过程的控制有很大关系。

Where they're operated and who's building them and those kinds of things.
包括它们在哪里运行，谁在构建它们，以及诸如此类的事情。

But you also need to be realistic about the fact that you simply can't do everything yourself.
但你也需要对一个事实保持现实：你不可能所有事情都亲力亲为。

Perhaps. And I think there's a number of companies that are trying to make this work in various ways.
或许如此。我认为有许多公司正试图以各种方式实现这一目标。

It's going to be really interesting to see in the coming years how it all pans out.
未来几年，这一切将如何发展，拭目以待将非常有趣。
