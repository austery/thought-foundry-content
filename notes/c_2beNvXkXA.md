title: 埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征：被忽视的疾病与医疗系统困境
---

### 被忽视的埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征

在现代医学史上，没有其他疾病像**埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征**（Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, EDS: 一种影响结缔组织的遗传性疾病）这样被忽视。这句话出自EDS专家兼风湿病学家罗德尼·格雷厄姆教授。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ella's Danlo syndrome. That quote is attributed to Professor Rodney Graham, a leading EDS expert and rheumatologist.</p>
</details>

埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征是一种遗传性疾病，主要影响身体的**结缔组织**（connective tissue: 支持、连接和分离不同类型组织和器官的组织），而结缔组织主要由**胶原蛋白**（collagen: 一种在结缔组织中发现的蛋白质，提供结构和弹性）组成。对于埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征患者来说，他们的胶原蛋白存在缺陷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ella's Danlo syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue which is primarily made up of collagen. And in the case of Ella's Damos patients, the collagen is faulty.</p>
</details>

这种缺陷可能导致皮肤弹性过大和**关节过度活动**（hyper-mobile joints: 关节活动范围超出正常限制）等症状。结果是，结缔组织无法像正常情况那样提供身体所需的支撑。结缔组织遍布我们全身，EDS可以影响韧带、皮肤、血管、器官、眼睛、牙龈和消化系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It can cause symptoms like stretchy skin and hyper mobile joints. The result is that it doesn't support you in the way it's supposed to. Connective tissue is all over our body. EDS can affect the ligaments, skin, blood vessels, organs, eyes, gums, and digestive system.</p>
</details>

EDS可能导致的一些疾病包括全身性疼痛、**肥大细胞疾病**（mass cell disorders: 肥大细胞异常激活或增殖引起的疾病）、**直立性心动过速综合征**（POTS, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: 一种自主神经系统失调，导致站立时心率异常升高）、痛经、**慢性疲劳综合征**（chronic fatigue syndrome: 一种以极度疲劳为主要特征的复杂疾病）、**克罗恩病**（Crohn's disease: 一种慢性炎症性肠病）、**神经多样性**（neurodivergence: 指大脑功能和处理信息方式的差异，而非缺陷）、**大脑迷雾**（brain fog: 一种认知功能障碍，表现为思维迟钝、注意力不集中和记忆力下降）、**视网膜脱离**（retina detachment: 视网膜从其下方的支撑组织分离）、**吞咽困难**（swallowing disorder: 吞咽食物或液体时出现困难）、抑郁症、**颅颈不稳**（cranial cervical instability, CCI: 颅骨底部和上颈椎之间的韧带松弛，导致异常移动）以及许多其他改变生活的疾病。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Some of the conditions that EDS can cause physical pain all over your body, mass cells disorders, POTS, painful menration, chronic fatigue syndrome, Crohn's disease, neurode divergence, brain fog, retina detachment, swallowing disorder, depression, cranial cervical instability, and many more lifealtering conditions.</p>
</details>

EDS通常被漏诊、治疗不足或误诊。它对人们的影响也各不相同，对某些人来说可能症状轻微，但对另一些人来说则可能导致残疾。在严重的情况下，甚至可能危及生命。这种独特性使得诊断更加困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">EDS is commonly missed, undertreated, and misdiagnosed. It also can impact people in different ways. It can be mild for some but disabling for others. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening. This uniqueness makes it harder to diagnose.</p>
</details>

根据多伦多大学最近发表的一篇文章，诊断EDS的估计时间在4到16年之间，而早期诊断至关重要。莉娜·邓纳姆和贾米拉·贾米尔等名人曾公开表示自己患有EDS。贾米拉·贾米尔分享说，她很幸运在九岁时就被诊断出来，因为小时候她就知道自己不应该参加接触性运动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to a recent article published by the University of Toronto, the estimate to be diagnosed is between 4 and 16 years. And early diagnosis is crucial. Celebrities like Lena Dunham and Jamila J have shared that they have EDS. Jamila Jamil shared that she was lucky to be diagnosed at age nine because as a child she knew that she shouldn't play contact sports.</p>
</details>

自1968年埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征首次分类以来，情况发生了很大变化。当时确定了五种类型，而如今EDS有13种不同的类别。专家们担心，由于这种疾病的研究不足，可能还有更多的分类尚未被发现，而且很少有临床专家真正了解它。这种研究的缺乏意味着EDS患者将继续遭受痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot has changed since Ellis Danlo syndrome was first classified in 1968. Back then five types were identified. Today there are 13 different categories of EDS. Experts worry there are more classifications because of how underststudied the condition is. and there are very few clinical experts who understand it. That lack of research means that people with EDS will continue to suffer. So, what else do we know?</p>
</details>

那么，我们还知道些什么呢？根据加拿大EDS基金会的数据，最常见的类型是关节过度活动型，占EDS确诊病例的90%。女性约占确诊病例的70%。EDS与早期流产、早产和死产的风险增加有关。如果需要剖腹产，还可能带来额外的危险。简而言之，EDS不仅仅是“关节松弛”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to Canada's EDS Foundation, the most common type is hyper mobile and it represents 90% of those diagnosed with EDS. Women make up approximately 70% of diagnosed cases. EDS is associated with a higher risk of early pregnancy loss, pre-term delivery, and still birth. And if you need a C-section, it can create additional dangers. In short, EDS is more than quote just loose joints.</p>
</details>

今天的嘉宾悉尼·贾兹瓦尔迪（Sydney Jazwaldi）被诊断出患有颅颈不稳，我之前提到过，这可能是由EDS引起的。悉尼尚未能确认自己患有EDS。在她的案例中，一场车祸触发了这种情况。EDS患者经历创伤（如**挥鞭式损伤**（whiplash: 颈部因快速前后摆动而造成的损伤））是很常见的，在这种情况下，韧带过度拉伸，由于它们由有缺陷的胶原蛋白组成或受损，因此无法再充分支撑头部和上脊柱。今天的节目将讨论悉尼面临的障碍。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Today's guest, Sydney Jazualdi, was diagnosed with cranial cervical instability, which I mentioned earlier can be caused by EDS. Sydney has not been able to confirm she has EDS. In her case, a car accident triggered this. It is common for EDS patients to experience a trauma like whiplash where the ligaments are overstretched and because there are made up of faulty collagen or damaged and no longer able to adequately hold up the head and upper spine. Today's episode will discuss the roadblocks that Sydney is facing. Here's our conversation with Sydney who tells us how a car accident changed her life.</p>

请大家仔细聆听。悉尼·贾兹瓦尔迪现在加入我们。

### 车祸后的急剧恶化

Nam Kiwanuka: 感谢您抽出时间与我交谈。您能带我们回到2023年7月吗？您当时发生了一场车祸，发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Um, can you take us back to July of 2023? You were in a car accident. What happened?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的，2023年7月21日，我在红灯前停车时被追尾了。后面的司机在撞击前从未尝试刹车。所以，起初我的医生认为我的伤势仅限于较轻的软组织损伤，比如挥鞭式损伤或脑震荡，因为标准的影像学检查未能揭示事故造成的全部损伤程度。但在事故发生后的六到七周内，我的症状开始急剧变化。我走路时开始失去平衡，出现了**足下垂**（drop foot: 由于神经或肌肉损伤导致无法抬起足部前部），这意味着我无法完全将脚抬离地面。我腿部和手臂的肌肉开始变得极其虚弱，我失去了大部分双手（尤其是右手）的灵活性和握力。我现在用笔写字超过一分钟，手就会失去知觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, so July 21st, 2023, I was rearended while stopped at a red light. The driver behind me never attempted to break um before the impact. So, at first, my doctors believed my injuries were limited to more mild soft tissue damage. So, things like whiplash or a concussion um because the standard imaging didn't reveal the full extent of the damage that did occur um from the accident. But over the next six to seven weeks following the accident, my symptoms began to change dramatically. I started losing my balance when walking. I developed drop foot, which meaning I could no longer fully lift my foot off the ground. My muscles in my legs and my arms started to become extremely weak. And I lost a lot like most of my dexterity and grip strength in both of my hands, especially my right hand. I still can't uh write with a pen for longer than a minute without losing feeling in my hand.</p>
</details>

但我不得不说，最可怕的部分是当我开始频繁出现**吞咽困难**（dysphasia: 此处指吞咽食物或液体时出现困难）发作时，感觉我的喉咙肌肉在吃东西，特别是喝东西时，会忘记如何吞咽。我还开始出现嘴唇和指甲变成紫蓝色的情况，我的身体感觉像是在忘记如何自动呼吸，我的身体和四肢都缺乏氧气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I would have to say the most frightening part was when I began having frequent episodes of dysphasia where it feels like my throat muscles would forget how to swallow when I was eating something and especially drinking something. And I also started having episodes where my lips and my fingernails would turn a purplish blue. And my body felt like it was forgetting how to breathe automatically. And there was just a lack of oxygen in my body and and extremities.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 车祸后会发生一些事情，比如脑震荡或者身体疼痛。但这听起来不像您所经历的情况。医生们说发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> After a car accident, there are certain things that happen like with concussion or maybe uh a body aches. But this doesn't sound that like that that's what was happening. What did doctors say was happening?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 嗯，他们最初的反应是“这不正常”。通常在事故发生后，随着时间的推移，人们会开始好转，但我却完全朝着相反的方向发展，随着时间的推移，我越来越糟。我看了很多专科医生，但我觉得自己被完全忽视了，不被相信，也不被理解。他们都喜欢直接得出结论，说“你有没有尝试过心理治疗？”你知道，因为我的病历上写着我过去有焦虑症，但老实说，在这个时代，谁没有焦虑症呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, their kind of initial reaction was this isn't normal. Um like usually after an accident people as time progresses uh following the accident they start to improve but I was going in the complete opposite direction as I was deteriorating as more time passed. I've seen so many specialists and I just felt very like written off and not believed and not understood and they all loved to kind of just jump to the conclusion of well have you tried therapy you know cuz I have anxiety in my chart from the past which I don't know who doesn't have anxiety honestly in this day and age um</p>
</details>

我根本不觉得医生们相信我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't feel believed D by the doctors at all.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 所以即使您有身体症状，也被当作是心理作用而忽视了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So even though you had physical symptoms, it was being dismissed as something that was just in your head.</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 完全正确。就像**身心疾病**（psychosomatic: 指心理因素导致或加重身体症状的疾病）一样，我一直得到的信息是，我不应该出现这些症状和问题。而且我见过的大多数医生都认为我的症状，比如走路不稳、足下垂、手指和嘴唇发蓝，主要是由于未解决的心理创伤引起的，例如中学时被欺凌之类的。一位医生甚至告诉我，我不需要再去急诊室了，因为他们认为并写在我的病历上的是焦虑发作。是的，这非常令人沮丧和恐惧，因为我只是害怕自己正在经历的症状，并寻求帮助，但我得到的却是完全相反的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Exactly. Like psychosmatic kind of the overall message I kept getting was I shouldn't be having these symptoms and issues that I was experiencing. Um, and the majority of doctors I've seen suggested that my symptoms, like my inability to walk without tripping over my feet, my drop, but my fingers and and lips turning blue were mostly also due to unresolved psychological trauma. Um, an example like being bullied in middle school or something. Um, and they, one doctor actually told me that I needed to stop going to the emergency room for what they believed and wrote in my chart were anxiety attacks. Um, yeah. So, that it was just very disheartening um, and scary because I just was scared of the symptoms I was experiencing and was looking for somebody to help me, but I was getting the complete opposite of that.</p>
</details>

### 生活的彻底改变与医疗困境

Nam Kiwanuka: 自车祸以来，您的生活发生了怎样的变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How has your life changed? Uh, since the car accident,</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 老实说，方方面面都变了。自从事故发生以来，我几乎失去了所有的独立性和自由。我现在完全依赖助行器，在家里需要使用助行车，每次出门看病都需要坐轮椅。我不再能独立完成基本的日常活动，需要父母的帮助。例如，洗澡、洗头、穿衣、准备饭菜。我不能去超市购物，不能独自去看病，也不能开车。自从事故发生那天起，我就没开过车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, in in every single way, honestly, like since the accident, I've lost almost all of my independence and freedom. I now rely completely on mobility aids, and I need to use a walker inside of my home and a wheelchair anytime I leave my home for medical appointments. Um, I'm no longer able to complete basic daily activities without help from my parents. Like some examples are showering, washing my hair, getting dressed, preparing meals. I can't grocery shop. I can't attend medical appointments on my own or drive. I haven't driven since the day of the accident.</p>
</details>

嗯，我想给您一个我日常生活的缩影：晚上要上楼到我的卧室，大约有14级台阶，我必须四肢并用地爬上去。而且必须有人在我身后支撑着，以防我失去平衡或摔倒，同时还要从后面推我上去，因为我不再有力量自己爬上去。我生活在持续的疼痛、眩晕和严重的神经系统症状中，我的精力极其有限。所以，即使是洗澡或阅读复杂的东西这样简单的任务，也会让我精疲力尽数小时，有时甚至一整天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I guess just to give you a bit of a, you know, snapshot into what my daily life is like, like at night to get to my bedroom, which is upstairs, which is about 14 steps, I have to crawl up on all fours, and someone has to brace behind me in case I lose my balance or I fall and at the same time push me up from behind because I just no longer have the strength to climb up on my own. Um, and I live with constant pain, dizziness, severe neurological symptoms, and my energy is so extremely limited. So, even simple tasks like showering or reading something complex can leave me exhausted for hours or even sometimes the rest of the day.</p>
</details>

我通常每天只能处理一次虚拟预约、一次电话或写两到三封电子邮件。我必须非常仔细地计划如何使用我的精力。例如，面对面的预约常常会让我好几天都无法活动。我基本上只能躺在沙发或床上，白天只有上洗手间时才会起身。有时我的症状变得非常严重，我不得不连续几周甚至几个月睡在楼下的客厅沙发上，因为我太虚弱了，无法爬上14级台阶到我的房间。有一次，我和家人甚至考虑买一个便携式马桶放在客厅，因为上洗手间所需的精力超出了我身体所能承受的范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I can usually only manage one virtual appointment, one phone call or writing two to three emails a day. And I really have to carefully plan how I use my energy before and after. Like at, for example, inerson appointments often put me out of commission for days afterwards. and I'm essentially couch bound and bed bound. And the only time I get up is to use the washroom during the day. Um, there have also been times when my symptoms have become so severe that I've had to sleep on the couch in my living room downstairs for weeks um or months because I was just too weak to make it up the 14 steps to my room. And at one point, my family and I were even considering buying a commode to keep in the living room because getting up to use the bathroom was more energy than my body could handle.</p>
</details>

我本应专注于康复，却不得不把过去两年半的每一分精力都花在寻求医疗护理上，而作为安大略省公民，通过**安大略省医疗保险计划**（OHIP, Ontario Health Insurance Plan: 加拿大安大略省的公共医疗保险系统），我本应有权获得这些护理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And instead of being able to focus on recovery, I've had to basically spend every ounce of energy the last 2 and 1/2 years almost just to access medical care um and care that should be my right as a Ontario citizen with OHIP.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 作为一名记者，我感到有些情绪；作为一位母亲，我感到另一些情绪。安大略省是加拿大最富裕的省份之一，我们生活在七国集团（G7）国家，而您却已经与这种情况抗争了两年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um as a journalist I'm feeling some things and as a mom I'm feeling other things. Um we Ontario is one of the most wealthiest provinces. We live in Canada uh a G7 country and this is something that you've uh been dealing with for two years.</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 所以您最终被诊断出患有颅颈不稳。什么是颅颈不稳？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So eventually you were diagnosed with something called cranioervical instability. What is cranio cervical instability?</p>
</details>

### 颅颈不稳的定义与影响

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的，**颅颈不稳**（cranioervical instability, CCI: 颅骨底部和上颈椎之间的韧带松弛，导致异常移动），也常被称为CCI，基本上是一种结构性疾病，颅骨底部的韧带变得过于松弛，导致颅骨和上颈椎（通常是C1和C2，就在颅骨底部下方）在颈部内异常移动。你知道，对于没有CCI的健康人来说，这些韧带通常足够强壮，能够将颅骨和椎骨牢固地固定在原位。在正常情况下，这个区域的移动非常小甚至没有。当这种稳定性丧失时，颅骨和上颈椎的异常移动实际上会压迫脑干和该区域的主要血管，包括将血液输送到大脑和从大脑排出血液的关键静脉和动脉，以及**脑脊液**（cerebral spinal fluid: 围绕我们大脑和脊髓的液体）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So cranioervical instability uh also kind of referred to as CCI is basically a structural condition where the ligaments at the base of the skull become too loose which allows the skull and the upper cervical vertebrae. So usually C1 and C2 which is right below the base of your skull to shift abnormally within the neck. And you know in somebody healthy without CCI, these ligaments are typically strong enough to hold your skull and vertebrae securely in place. And under normal circumstances, there is very little to to zero movement in this area. And when that stability is lost, the abnormal movement of the skull and upper cervical vertebrae actually can put pressure on the brain stem and major blood vessels in that area which include critical veins and arteries that get blood into your brain and out of your brain and also cerebral spinal fluid which is the fluid that surrounds our brain and spinal cord.</p>
</details>

这种压迫会导致严重的神经系统症状，并扰乱**自主神经系统**（autonomic nervous system: 控制身体非自主功能的神经系统，如呼吸、心率、消化）的功能。所以，就像我之前提到的，感觉我的身体会忘记如何呼吸或吞咽。这与自主神经系统密切相关，因为我们的自主神经系统控制着我们身体自动进行的一切，比如呼吸、血压、心率、消化、排便，还有我们的免疫系统，基本上是你身体里所有无需有意识思考就能做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this compression can cause severe neurological symptoms and disrupt the function of the autonomic nervous system. So kind of referring to earlier when I mentioned how it felt like my body would forget how to breathe or swallow. Um it's very connected because our our autonomic nervous system controls everything that our body does automatically. So our breathing, our our blood pressure, our heart rate, digestion, bowel movements, and you know, our immune system, and basically everything that you don't have to think of doing consciously in your body,</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 您最终是如何被诊断出患有CCI的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> how were you finally diagnosed with CCI?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的。在与安大略省的医生打交道，并让他们不断地给我“身心疾病”和其他各种借口后，我开始在网上研究，试图找出是否有人在机动车事故或其他任何事情之后，也曾像我一样突然恶化。我发现了很多在线支持小组，里面的人都经历过与我非常相似的情况，有着完全相同的症状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So after kind of dealing with the Ontario doctors and having them kind of give me the runaround of, you know, the psychosmatic and everything else argument, I just started researching online and trying to figure out anything I could if other people have ever had such a sudden deterioration similar to mine um following a motor vehicle accident or or anything else. And I found a lot of groups online, support groups of people who had dealt with very similar situations to me with the exact same symptoms.</p>
</details>

通过这项研究，我找到了我在美国纽约长岛的神经外科医生。他通过**磁共振成像**（MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 一种利用强磁场和无线电波生成身体内部详细图像的医学成像技术）、影像学检查、**CT扫描**（CT scans, Computed Tomography scans: 一种利用X射线和计算机生成身体内部横截面图像的医学成像技术）和我在五月份进行的侵入性检查，正式诊断了我。我为此不得不去了纽约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And through this research, I found my neurosurgeon in the US who is in New York State in Long Island. And he is the one that formally diagnosed me uh via MRI, imaging, CT scans, and invasive testing, which I did back in May. I had to go to New York for that.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 哦，所以您不得不离开您的省份，您的国家，甚至只是为了在另一个国家获得诊断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, [laughter] so you had to leave your province, your country to get even just a diagnosis in another country.</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的，没错。早在2024年4月，我通过研究发现，全世界只有极少数神经外科医生专门治疗这种疾病。所以，我咨询的第一位医生实际上在西班牙巴塞罗那。我飞到那里，做了很多影像学检查，并与他进行了一些非侵入性测试，他也给了我诊断。然后我回到了加拿大。所以，这大约是2024年4月、5月左右。我试图将我在CD上获得的报告和影像学资料带给安大略省的神经外科医生，但他们甚至不看。我试图把资料给他们，试图向他们解释，你知道，就像“嘿，我找到了原因。这就是我的问题所在，我们能解决吗？”但他们根本不想与此或与我扯上任何关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes, that that's correct. And back in April of 2024, I kind of through my research found out that there's only a very few neurosurgeons in the world that specialize in this condition. Um, so the first doctor I consulted was actually in Barcelona, uh, Spain. So I flew there and got a bunch of imaging done, did some, uh, testing with him that wasn't invasive and he gave me a diagnosis as well. So then I came back to Canada. So this was, yeah, around April, May 2024. And I tried bringing my report and imaging on CDs that I got to Ontario neurosurgeons and they would not even look at it. I um I tried to give it to them. I tried to explain to them, you know, like, hey, I I figured it out. This is what's wrong with me and like we can can we fix this? And they just had they didn't want anything to do with it or me. It felt like [panting]</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 我读到，颅颈不稳对女性的影响更大，因为女性更有可能患有埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征，如果我没说错的话。颅颈不稳是由它引起的。您患有埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> well I read that uh cranial cervical instability impacts more women because women are more likely to have something called correct me if I'm wrong in how I am saying it Ellis Danlos syndrome um and cranial cervical instability is caused by it. Do you have Ella's Danlos? though. Yes, you are correct in that and um I haven't been formally assessed or diagnosed with Ellers's Danlo syndrome.</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的，您说得没错。我还没有被正式评估或诊断出患有埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征，所以我不能确定。但我认为重要的是要理解，颅颈不稳在患有EDS的患者中非常常见，而且就像您刚才说的，这些患者中的大多数是女性。这就是为什么倡导者们如此努力地推动提高认识和认可的原因。我相信，一种主要影响女性的疾病，在系统和医学上都如此不被认可和忽视，绝非巧合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I can't say for certain but what I think is important and to understand is that herio cervical instability is very often seen in people with EDS Ellers Danlo syndrome and the majority like you just said of these patients are women um which is why advocates are pushing so hard for greater awareness and recognition. And I believe it's no coincidence that a condition that predominantly affects women has been so under recognized and neglected both systemically and medically.</p>
</details>

但是，创伤本身，就像我案例中的机动车事故，也可能导致患有或未患有EDS的人出现这种韧带损伤和不稳定性，这一点也得到了广泛认可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but it is also well recognized that trauma alone in my case such as an MVA, motor vehicle accident, can cause this kind of ligament injury and instability in people both with or without EDS.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 您能帮助我们理解什么是EDS吗？什么是埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Can you help us understand what EDS is? What is Ellis Danlo syndrome?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征有多种类型，不同的亚型。例如，有血管型埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征、经典型埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征，以及我认为最常见的关节过度活动型埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征。但基本上，患有埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征的人，我们的身体无法有效地产生胶原蛋白，这会影响我们的结缔组织和筋膜，筋膜基本上是把所有东西连接在一起的，把你的肌肉固定在原位，韧带连接着其他肌肉和它旁边的肌肉，以及你的关节固定在原位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Ellers's Danlo syndrome there are multiple types of it um different subtypes. So for example there's like vascular ellers Danlos, classic Ellers Danlows, um hyper mobile ellers Danlos which I believe is the most common one. Um but basically people with Ellers's Danlos our bodies do not produce collagen effectively and so that affects our connective tissue and fascia which is basically what holds everything together. your muscles in place. Uh ligaments connecting other muscles to the muscles beside it and your joints holding your joints in place.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Um is there a cure for it?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 据我所知没有。我认为更多的是学会与它共存，并在你的生活方式中做出调整，以帮助支持你的身体和需求。它非常复杂，因为埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征的每种亚型都有不同的相关症状。所以，是的，这是一个复杂的问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Not that I am aware of. I believe it's more learning to live with it. Um and having accommodations in your lifestyle that will help support your body. um and needs uh it's very complex because each subtype of elders Dan Lowe's has different symptoms associated with it. Um so yeah, it's kind of a complex question</p>

### 寻求境外治疗：官僚障碍与资金困境

Nam Kiwanuka: 对于正在收听播客而不是观看视频的人来说，他们可能不知道您戴着颈托，而且必须一直戴着。您的家庭医生将您转介给了安大略省各地脊柱诊所的八位医生，但您被拒绝了会诊。您知道原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and for people who are listening to the podcast and not watching the video um they might not um know that you have a neck brace and you have to wear that all the time. Your family physician has referred you to eight doctors at spinal clinics across Ontario, but you've been denied consultation. Do you know why?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的，我确实有点了解原因。要符合**OHIP境外预批计划**（OHIP out of country prior approval program: 安大略省医疗保险计划，如果加拿大境内无法提供手术，可以支付境外手术费用）的资格，卫生部要求安大略省的专科医生提供一份非常具体的支持信，该医生必须被认为与将要进行手术或程序的境外外科医生具有同等资格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, yes, I I do kind of have an idea why. So to qualify for the OHIP out of country prior approval program which is a program where OHIP can cover the cost of surgery performed outside of Canada if it isn't available here. The Ministry of Health requires a very specific support letter from an Ontario specialist who is considered equivalent to the outofcountry surgeon who would be performing whatever surgery or procedure needed.</p>
</details>

部分规定是，安大略省的专科医生必须提供一份支持信，其中包含医疗保健法中规定的三个重要要点。如果没有这三点书面内容并随境外申请一起提交，就会导致自动拒绝。我的家庭医生将我转介给了大多伦多地区（GTA）的九位神经外科医生，包括颅底神经外科医生、骨科脊柱外科医生，以及萨加的一个有几位不同神经外科医生工作的脊柱诊所。我收到了九份转介中的八份正式拒绝，第九份则从未回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And part of the rules is that the Ontario specialist must provide a support letter saying three important points that is part of the healthc care act. And without these three points written and submitted alongside the out of country application, it results in an automatic denial. And my family doctor referred me to nine neurosurgeons across the GTA, including skull-based neurosurgeons, orthopedic spine surgeons, and also a spinal clinic in a saga that has several different neurosurgeons working out of it. And I received formal denials from eight of the nine referrals sent and the nine just never responded.</p>
</details>

所有这些转介的目的是为了获得OHIP境外申请所需的这份支持信。这份信的必要性以及鉴于我神经和身体状况恶化而产生的紧迫性，在每一份转介中都非常清楚地说明了。我们还提供了所有相关的影像学资料，包括我的颈部和大脑的MRI、CT扫描，以及所有适用的医疗记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the intent behind all of these referrals was to obtain that required support letter for the OHIP at a country application. And the need for this letter and the urgency given my worsening neurological and physical condition was very clearly stated on every single referral. And we also provided all the relevant imaging including MRIs, CT scans of my neck and my brain and as as well as whatever medical records were applicable</p>
</details>

每一位神经外科医生都拒绝了。其中四份拒绝信表示，拒绝的原因是这超出了他们的范围。两位医生说他们的等候名单已经太长，一位医生说他们只接受外科医生之间的转介，而不是家庭医生转介给神经外科医生。另一位医生说我没有必要进行神经外科会诊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and every single neurosurgeon said no. Um, four of the rejections stated that the reasoning for the rejection was that this was out of their scope. Um, two said that their weight lists are already too long and one said that they only accepted referrals from surgeon to surgeon, not family doctor to neurosurgeon. and another one said that there was no need for me to have a neurosurgical consultation.</p>
</details>

这非常令人沮丧，因为我基本上陷入了官僚僵局，因为我无法让安大略省的神经外科医生提供所需的支持信，而没有这封信，OHIP将自动拒绝我的境外资助申请。所以，过去一年半以来，我基本上每天都在努力争取获得这封支持信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very frustrating because I've been stuck basically in a bureaucratic loop because I can't get an Ontario neurosurgeon to provide the required support letter and without that letter OHIP will automatically deny my application for out of country funding. So that's trying to obtain a support letter has been what I've spent all day every day doing for the last year and a half basically.</p>
</details>

我曾尝试向我的**省议会议员**（MPP, Member of Provincial Parliament: 加拿大安大略省立法机关的成员）求助，让他们代表我联系卫生部。我曾尝试提交**信息自由请求**（Freedom of Information request: 根据法律要求政府或公共机构提供信息的请求），以找出OHIP可以帮助我的安大略省这些外科医生的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I've tried advocating with my MPP to have them reach out to the Ministry of Health on my behalf. I've tried to submit a freedom of information request to figure out the supposed names of these surgeons at OHIPZ can help me um in Ontario.</p>
</details>

我的省议会议员在多伦多的皇后公园发表了关于我情况的议员声明。我有一篇新闻文章发表，我甚至通过**安大略省人权法庭**（Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario: 处理安大略省人权法典下歧视投诉的准司法机构）提交了一份人权申请，基本上解释了我以及安大略省许多其他颅颈不稳患者所陷入的这个循环，这导致我们无法获得救命的神经外科护理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had my MPP she made a member statement at Queens Park in Toronto uh about my situation. I've had a news article published and I've even submitted a human rights application through the human rights tribunal of Ontario basically explaining this loop that I and so many other people in Ontario with cranioervical instability are stuck in that is leaving us without access to life-saving neurosurgical care.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 听起来您因为繁文缛节而陷入了无人之境。您实际上创建了一个**GoFundMe**（GoFundMe: 一个在线众筹平台）来筹集资金，以便您可以前往美国支付手术费用。您打算去美国吗？或者您需要获得批准吗？您现在进展如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like because of red tape, you're just kind of in a no man's land. Um, and you've actually you actually um created a GoFundMe to raise money so you can travel to the States and pay for the surgery. Um, are you going to go to the States or do you need to get signed off? Like, uh, where are you at with that now?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 是的。GoFundMe是为了支付我之前提到的纽约神经外科医生的侵入性检查费用。因为他不会进行手术，除非你达到一定的测量阈值和症状改善。所以基本上，侵入性检查模拟了融合手术对我能起到的作用，幸运的是，我的一些最令人虚弱的症状改善了90%以上，我感觉自己近两年半来第一次恢复了正常。所以，是的，GoFundMe是为了支付检查费用，大约45,000加元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, the GoFundMe was to pay for the invasive testing with the neurosurgeon in New York that I mentioned earlier. Um, because he will not operate unless you ask like meet a certain threshold of measurements and symptom improvement. So basically the invasive testing mimicked what they the fusion surgery would do for me and there like luckily for me I had like upwards of 90% symptom improvement in every some of my most debilitating symptoms and I felt like myself again for the first time in almost two and a half years. So yeah, the GoFundMe was to try and cover the cost of the testing which was around $45,000 Canadian.</p>
</details>

现在，由于我符合大型融合手术的条件，该手术的费用将高达40万加元。所以，显然，我无法自掏腰包支付40万加元，除非让父母卖掉房子并放弃他们的退休储蓄，这在道德上我永远无法要求他们这样做，但我也不应该这样做。因为作为安大略省公民，根据《安大略省健康保险法》，如果一项医学上必要的手术无法在本地进行，并且是合理和必要的，那么它应该由OHIP和卫生部承担费用。所以，就像您之前提到的，问题不在于没有资金途径，而是繁文缛节阻碍了我获得所需的护理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now um since I qualify for the big fusion surgery that will cost in Canadian dollars upwards of $400,000. So, obviously, I can't afford $400,000 out of pocket without [snorts] asking my parents to sell our home and give up their retirement savings, which morally I could never ask them to do that, but I also shouldn't have to um because as an Ontario citizen, it's my legal right under the Ontario Health Insurance Act that if a medically necessary procedure cannot not be performed here and it's justified and needed, it should be covered by OHIP and the Ministry of Health. So, kind of like you mentioned earlier, the problem isn't that there's no pathway for funding, it's that red tape is preventing me from accessing the care that I need.</p>
</details>

### 呼吁政策制定者：为被“抹去”的患者发声

Nam Kiwanuka: 嗯，这不是您第一次接受采访。您提到您曾接受CBC的采访。您的省议会议员，您也一直与他们保持联系。您希望政策制定者了解您身上发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, this isn't your first interview. Uh, you mentioned that you did an interview with uh CBC. you um your local your MPP uh you've been in touch with them. What do you want policy makers to know about what has happened to you?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 我希望他们知道这不是一个孤立的案例。给您一些背景，有一个颅颈不稳的Facebook支持小组，我相信目前有超过800人，他们都有着和我完全相同的故事，即他们患有这种疾病，但无法让安大略省的任何医生认可并支持他们的境外申请。所以我认识很多人，不仅在安大略省，在其他省份也有，他们不得不卖掉房子和所有资产，去美国或欧洲或他们选择的任何专家那里进行手术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want them to know that this is not a oneoff case. Uh just to give you some context, there is a cranio cervical instability Facebook support group um that has I believe at this point over 800 people in it who all have the exact same story as me in the sense that they have this condition and they can't get any doctor in Ontario to recognize ize it and support their out of country application. So I know multiple people not even just in Ontario but in other provinces who have had to sell their houses and all their assets to pay for surgery in the United States or Europe or whatever specialist they decide to go with to do the surgery.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 悉尼，手术会如何改变您的生活？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sydney, how would uh surgery change your life?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 如果我能获得并进行手术，稳定我的颅骨和颈部，并减轻对脑干的压力，那不会是一夜之间的解决办法，但它有可能让我重获新生。我将能够走路，清晰思考，并重新过上独立的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I could get and access the surgery that would stabilize my skull and neck and taking the pressure off of my brain stem. It wouldn't be an overnight fix, but it has the potential to give me my life back. I could, you know, walk and and think clearly and get back to living independently.</p>
</details>

这不仅仅是为了恢复行动能力，也是为了找回我的尊严，让我的生活恢复稳定。就像我之前提到的，当我进行牵引测试时，我的症状立即得到了显著改善，我的大脑迷雾消散了，我可以不受限制地深呼吸，甚至我的手部灵活性也提高了。那是我们进行的一项测试。我又能正常地用笔写字了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not just about mobility and gaining that back. It's also about just getting my dignity back and having that stability in my life. [snorts] Like I mentioned earlier, when I underwent the traction testing, there was an immediate and noticeable improvement in my symptoms and my brain fog lifted and I could breathe deeply without restriction and my hand dexterity even improved. That was one of the tests we did. Uh, I could write with a pen again, normally.</p>
</details>

感觉就像我的身体终于记起了如何再次正常运作。我的意思是，手术可以改变一切。我真诚地希望，无论何时我能获得手术，它都能实现这一点。这将是第二次生命的机会，因为自从事故发生以来，我生活中的一切都停滞了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was like my body finally remembered how to function normally again. And I mean, the surgery could change everything. And I am genuinely hopeful that it will when whenever I will be able to access it. Um, it it would just be like a second chance at living and cuz everything in my life has been on pause since the accident.</p>
</details>

那些健康人、健全人无需多想就能自然做到的事情，我终于又能做到了。我真的认为我会对这一切怀有更深的感激。你知道，能够自己洗澡、做饭、在婚礼上跳舞、散步。那些平凡的瞬间会变得更加特别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And things that healthy people and able-bodied people can do naturally without a second thought, I would finally be able to do again. And I really do think that I would carry a deeper appreciation for all of it. You know, being able to bathe myself, cooking a meal, dancing at a wedding, going for walks. Um those small ordinary moments would feel like so much more special. I think</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 悉尼，非常荣幸能与您交谈。非常感谢您抽出时间，希望这次对话能推动讨论向前发展，我们所有人向您致以最美好的祝愿。在告别之前，您还有什么想补充的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sydney, it's been an absolute pleasure having the opportunity to speak with you. Um, thank you so much for making the time and hopefully this conversation can move the conversation forward and we extend everybody here extends our best wishes to you. Is there anything else that you'd like to add before we say bye?</p>
</details>

Sydney Jazwaldi: 我们迫切需要对颅颈不稳的官方认可、适当的诊断和计费代码，以及在本地无法提供治疗时，对省外和境外护理的资助。我希望政策制定者知道，这不仅仅是一个患者的问题，而是整个被系统“抹去”的患者群体的问题。我们需要承认EDS合并CCI的患者是真实存在的，他们的病情是真实的，并且可以治疗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We urgently need official recognition and proper diagnostic and billing codes for cranioervical instability and funding for out of province and out of country care when treatment isn't available here. Um, and I I want policy makers to know that this isn't just about one patient. It's about an entire community of people who have been erased by the system. And we need acknowledgement that EDS patients with CCI exist and that their conditions are real and treatable.</p>
</details>

卫生部和安大略省卫生局的第一步是分配一个适当的诊断和计费代码。我们还知道，创建这种途径是可能的，而且已经做到了。通过OHIP的境外计划，已经存在一个针对与埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征共病的**脑脊液渗漏**（cerebral spinal fluid leaks: 脑脊液从颅骨或脊柱逸出）的模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the first step for the Ministry of Health and Ontario Ontario Health to assign is to assign a proper diagnostic and and billing code. And we also know that creating this kind of pathway is possible and it's already been done. Um a model already exists through OHIPS out of country program for a condition uh that is kind of comorbid to Ellers's Danlos. It's cerebral spinal fluid leaks.</p>
</details>

安大略省已经与两家美国医院签订了协议，为患有这种疾病的公民提供资金和治疗，并将他们送往那里接受他们所需的改变生活和救命的治疗。所以我们知道这是可以做到的，只是还没有为CCI和埃勒斯-丹洛斯综合征患者做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Ontario already has agreements with two US hospitals to fund and treat citizens with that condition and send them there to get the life-changing and life-saving treatment that they need. So we know it can be done. It just hasn't been done yet for people with CCI and Ellers Danlos.</p>
</details>

建立类似的框架不仅能让患者及时获得手术护理，还能促进安大略省专家与美国医院或中心之间的协作和知识转化，将这些专业知识带回安大略省，以促进本地的医学进步，这样也许有一天我们就不必为了医疗护理而离开本省或国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Developing this similar framework would not only allow patients to receive timely surgical care, but promote collaboration and knowledge translation between Ontario specialists and US hospitals or centers. bringing that expertise back to Ontario to foster medical advancements here so that maybe one day we won't have to leave the province or country for medical care.</p>
</details>

我最后想说的是，我希望政策制定者知道，这不是一次性的解决办法。对于许多CCI和EDS患者来说，护理涉及多个阶段和持续的手术随访。治疗计划和资金必须反映这种需求和现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I just the last thing I want to say regarding this is I want policy makers to know that this isn't a one-time fix. For many patients with CCI and EDS, care involves multiple stages and ongoing surgical follow-ups. And the treatment plan and the funding must reflect that need and that reality.</p>
</details>

我们不是在要求特殊待遇。我们只是在要求获得与本省和本国几乎所有其他患者相同的医疗可及性、认可和尊严。不同之处在于，我们的疾病不那么“令人接受”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and we're not asking for special treatment. We are just asking for the same access, recognition and dignity that is afforded to almost every other patient in this province and country. The difference is is our illness just isn't as palatable.</p>
