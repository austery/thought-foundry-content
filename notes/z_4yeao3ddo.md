### 加拿大冰球文化的深刻反思

主持人：加拿大是一个冰球之国。这项运动是数百万人的骄傲和共同目标。因此，当2022年爆出五名加拿大**世界青年队**（World Junior Team: 国际冰球联合会举办的青年冰球赛事中的国家队成员）球员被指控性侵的故事时，这个国家本身面临着一场清算。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Canada is a hockey nation. The sport is a source of pride and shared purpose for millions. So when the story broke in 2022 that five Canadian World Junior players had been accused of sexual assault, the country itself faced a reckoning.</p>
</details>

主持人：几年前，我的儿子也打冰球。当我想到这种文化显然正在渗透到该组织的最高层时，我能理解为什么如此多的父母，以及如此多以我们国家冬季运动为傲的加拿大人，会对正在发生的一切感到彻底厌恶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A few years ago. I had my my son in hockey, and when I think about the culture that is apparently permeating the highest orders of that organisation, I can understand why so many parents, why so many Canadians who take such pride in our national winter sport, are absolutely disgusted by what's going on.</p>
</details>

主持人：尽管这些球员在七月被宣判无罪，但对有毒冰球文化的担忧并未消失，新的事件也浮出水面。我们如何确保年轻人获得正确的指导并面对正确的后果？房间里的大人们在哪里？你经常听到体育能塑造品格，教导孩子们如何面对输赢，如何全力以赴。但多大的压力才算过大？对竞争的渴望最终会不会对年轻人弊大于利？这里是《The Rundown》。观看本次采访的人请注意内容警告，其中包含对性侵犯的讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And although the players were acquitted in July, concerns about toxic hockey culture haven't gone away and new incidents have come to light. How can we make sure young men get the right kind of guidance and face the right kind of consequences? Where are the adults? In the room, then? You often hear that sports builds character, teaches kids about winning and losing, about giving something your all. But how much pressure is too much pressure? Can the desire to compete end up doing more harm than good for youth? This is The Rundown. A content warning for those watching this interview contains discussions of sexual assault.</p>
</details>

主持人：2022年5月，**TSN**（The Sports Network: 加拿大体育专业有线电视网络）高级记者里克·韦斯特海德（Rick Westhead）爆出了一则爆炸性新闻。五名加拿大世界青年队球员被指控于2018年6月在安大略省伦敦市的一家酒店房间内性侵一名年轻女性。**加拿大冰球协会**（Hockey Canada: 加拿大冰球运动的管理机构）对此案一直保持沉默，此后更多关于性侵和暴力欺凌的故事浮出水面。我与韦斯特海德谈论了他的新书《我们培养狮子：直面加拿大困扰的冰球文化》（"We Breed Lions: Confronting Canada's Troubled Hockey Culture"），以及青少年冰球世界中哪些改变了，哪些没有改变。里克，欢迎来到我们临时搭建的演播室。你最近怎么样？

<details>

<p class="english-text">In May 2022, TSN senior correspondent Rick Westhead broke an explosive story. Five Canada World Junior players had allegedly sexually assaulted a young woman in a London, Ontario, hotel room in June 2018. Hockey Canada had kept the case quiet, and more stories of assault and violent hazing have emerged since. I talked to Westhead about his new book, We Breed Lions: Confronting Canada's Troubled Hockey Culture and what's changed and hasn't changed in the world of junior hockey. Rick, welcome to our makeshift studio. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：很好，非常好。很高兴能加入你们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. Great, great. Glad to join you.</p>
</details>

主持人：我想谈谈你是如何开始撰写加拿大冰球文化中存在的问题的。这实际上始于一通电话。但请告诉我，这一切是如何发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk about how you started writing about the problems in hockey culture in Canada. This really began with sort of a phone call. But tell me, how did that all come about?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：实际上，这在此之前就开始了。在2021年的春夏两季，我做了大量关于**芝加哥黑鹰队**（Chicago Blackhawks: 北美国家冰球联盟的球队之一）一名球员指控被球队教练性侵的报道。从那时起，也就是2021年10月21日以来，这四年里没有一个星期我没有收到一些可靠的线索，人们请求我调查各种问题，无论是性侵、欺诈指控还是体育中的虐待行为。而这个关于加拿大冰球协会诉讼的故事也是以同样的方式开始的，有人在2022年5月给了我一个线索，关于一起在安大略省伦敦市法院悄悄提起并和解的诉讼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It actually kind of began before that. So through the summer, spring, and summer of 2021, I did a lot of reporting on an allegation that a player with the Chicago Blackhawks had made who said that he'd been sexually assaulted by one of the coaches with that team. And since then, since October 21st, there has not been a week that's gone by in these four years that I haven't received a number of credible tips from people asking me to look into issues, whether it's sexual assault or fraud allegations or maltreatment in sports. And and this story on the Hockey Canada lawsuit started the same way with somebody giving me a tip in May 2022 about a lawsuit that had been filed and settled quietly in a London, Ontario, courthouse.</p>
</details>

主持人：对于那些不熟悉情况、没有关注新闻头条的人，请给我们介绍一下。我知道这个案子已经结案了，但请给我们一个概念，这个案子是如何开始的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For people who aren't familiar, who haven't been tuning into the headlines, give us a little. I know that case is wrapped up, but give us an idea of what that case sort of started.</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：嗯，这个案子引起了国际头条关注。一名在法庭文件中被确认为M的女性声称，她被加拿大2018年世界青年冰球队的多名球员性侵。她说她去了安大略省伦敦市的一家酒吧，遇到了冰球运动员，并最终回去与其中一名球员发生了自愿性行为。她说，事后，这名球员邀请了他队里的所有球员回来参与群交。伦敦警方于2024年1月宣布了刑事指控。最终进行了审判。经过两个月的审判，法官不仅宣判所有五名球员，所有五名共同被告无罪，而且法官实际上还表示，她在此案中也发现了实际的同意。所以从刑事角度来看，这些球员被宣判无罪；而另一方面，**国家冰球联盟**（National Hockey League: 北美顶级职业冰球联赛）随后发表声明，仍然谴责了所发生的事情，称酒店房间里发生的行为是不恰当和错误的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this case captured international headlines. It was where a woman who was identified in court documents as M, alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by a number of players with Canada's 2018 World junior hockey team. She said that she attended a bar in London, Ontario and met hockey players and wound up going back to have consensual sex with one of those players. And she said that after the fact, the player invited all the players on his team to come back and participate in group sex. And so the criminal charges were announced in January 2024 by London police. And ultimately there was a trial. And after a two month trial, the judge not only acquitted all five players, all five co-defendants, but the judge actually said that she had found actual consent in this case as well. So in one respect, from a criminal perspective, these players were acquitted and in another, the National Hockey League came out subsequently and still condemned what happened, saying that the behaviour that took place in that hotel room was inappropriate and wrong.</p>
</details>

主持人：这只是你在书中探讨的一个案例。我想谈谈人们对这本书的评价以及你的期望。你写道，你希望这本书不是为了摧毁这项运动，而是为了让它变得更好。我很好奇，你是否曾被指责试图摧毁这项运动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's just one case that you look at throughout this book. I want to talk about some maybe what people have have said about the book and what your hopes were. You wrote that your hope of this book is not to tear down the game, but to make it better. I am curious, have you been accused of trying to tear the game apart?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：嗯，冰球在加拿大社会中占据着特殊的地位，不是吗？是的，我想每当，你知道，伟大的加拿大记者斯蒂芬·布伦特（Stephen Brunt）为这本书写了前言，他这样说：批评冰球就是反冰球，反冰球就是反加拿大。所以当你讲述一个令人不舒服的真相时，你自然会受到反弹。但两件事可以同时是真的，对吧。你可以拥有一项如此精彩的运动，同时仍然存在需要面对的系统性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, hockey enjoys a particular place in Canadian society, doesn't it? Yeah, and I think whenever, you know, Stephen Brunt, great Canadian journalist, wrote the foreword for this book and the way he put it was to critique hockey is to be anti hockey and to be anti-hockey is to be anti-Canadian. And so when you, you know, are telling a story that's an uncomfortable truth, you're naturally going to get blowback. But two things can be true, right. You can have a sport that's so amazing and still have these systemic issues that need to be confronted.</p>
</details>

### 青少年冰球体系的商业化与同辈压力

主持人：我不想假设所有听众或观众都熟悉冰球，也有人对青少年冰球系统本身不熟悉。对于不了解的人来说，它是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to assume that everyone is familiar with hockey who is listening or watching to this, and there are people who are unfamiliar with the junior hockey system in itself. For people who don't know, how does it work?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：所以我在书中探讨的一个方面是青少年冰球的商业化。对。我们谈论的是11、12、13岁的孩子，以及这如何成为一个主要产业，还有青少年系统。它的运作方式是，如果你足够优秀，是一名精英球员，你很可能在14、15或16岁时离开家庭，去为一支青少年球队效力，有时离家数百英里。这就是，你知道，与经历过这个系统的球员交谈时非常有趣的地方。他们描述的情况是，你很小就离家，与一些年龄在20岁或更大的队友以及成年人一起打球。你非常渴望被接受，因为如果你不被接受，你就会成为异类，没有人希望那样。所以这是一个真正的情境，顺从性（conformity）发挥作用。再次，当你如此渴望被接受时，你知道，我采访过的球员，我采访了58名男性，58名在过去十年中在加拿大打过**青少年A级冰球**（Junior A Hockey: 加拿大青少年冰球体系中的一个高级别联赛，通常指16-20岁年龄段）的球员。他们异口同声地说，虽然他们热爱这项运动，但他们也指出，当他们如此年轻就不得不离家时，确实存在这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the things I look at in this book is both the commercialisation of minor hockey. Right. So we're talking about kids 11, 12, 13 years old and how that has become a major industry, but also the junior system. And so how that works is if you are good enough, you're an elite player, you may well leave your family home at the age of 14, 15 or 16 to go off and play for a junior team, sometimes hundreds of miles away from your family. And this is where, you know, it's really interesting talking to players who've been through this system. And what they describe is a situation where you move away from home. You're so young and you're playing on a team with teammates who are in some cases 20 or older and adults, adults. And you're so desperate to be accepted because if you're not accepted, you're an outlier and no one wants that. So this is a real situation where conformity comes into play. And again, when you are so desperate to be accepted, you know, the players I've talked to and I interviewed 58 men, 58 who've played junior hockey, junior A hockey within the last ten years in Canada. And they, to a person have said that while they love the game, they've identified that there is these real issues when when they're so young and have to move away from home.</p>
</details>

### 欺凌与虐待：一个恶性循环

主持人：你的书不仅分享了被指控实施性侵的冰球运动员的故事，还写了那些遭受同伴甚至教练欺凌和虐待的球员。这是否会相互助长？当你纸上谈兵，阅读你的书时，这似乎很明显是一个循环问题，但它真的会相互助长吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your book shares stories not only of hockey players who are allegedly perpetrating sexual assault, but you also write about players who've been victims of hazing and abuse, whether it's by their own peers or even coaches. Does this feed each other? It seems pretty obvious when you look at it on paper, when you're reading through your book that this is a cyclical problem, but does it feed into each other?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：对吧？我的意思是，如果球员们互相物化，那么当他们物化年轻女性时，我们难道应该感到惊讶吗？你知道，有很多事情让我感到震惊。老实说，我以前没有详细听说过许多球员经历过的这些“成人礼”。其中一个记忆，是我在报道这个故事时留下的。我坐在多伦多西区我住处附近的一家餐厅里。我与一名20多岁的年轻人和他的父亲坐在一起。我在书里听到了那位球员，马库斯·帕特森（Marcus Patterson）和他的父亲汤姆（Tom）的故事。马库斯·帕特森在2019年打过青少年A级冰球。他第一次告诉他的父亲，当时我们正在吃早餐，关于他在2019年打青少年A级冰球时经历的一个叫做**“热箱”**（Hot Box: 一种在青少年冰球中被提及的欺凌仪式）的成人礼。对于不了解那是什么的人来说，他当时是球队的新秀，在一次客场旅行中，他们乘坐球队大巴，所有新秀都被叫到大巴后面，拍拍肩膀，再回来。他们离教练有10到15英尺远。所以这就引出了一个问题，教练们是否知道发生了什么。但新秀们走到大巴后面，被告知脱光衣服，然后他们都被迫挤进大巴后面的洗手间，想象一下五六个16、17岁的青少年赤身裸体地挤在里面。灯被关掉，一些硬币通过通风口扔进来，他们被告知，你们只有收集到3.25美元的零钱才能出来。嗯，搞笑的是，里面只有0.95美元的硬币。所以我听说过球员在这种情况下待了半小时或更长时间的轶事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? I mean, isn't it a natural progression if players are going to objectify one another? Should we be surprised when there are cases where they're objectifying young women? You know, and there are a lot of this shocked me. I'll be honest. I had not heard in detail about a lot of these rites of passages that that many of these players have gone through. One of them are memories. I have that from reporting this. I sat in Toronto at a, at a, at a restaurant in the, in the West End near where I live. And I sat with a young man in his 20s and his and the man's father. And I heard in the player there in the book, so Marcus Patterson and his father, Tom and Marcus Patterson played junior hockey, junior A hockey in 2019. And he told his dad for the first time about, well, we were sitting at breakfast about how when he played junior A hockey in 2019, he went through this rite of passage called the Hot Box. And for people who don't know what that is, he was a rookie on the team and during a road trip, they were on the team bus, and all of the rookies on that team got called to the back of the team bus, tapped on the shoulder, come back again. They're 10 or 15 feet away from their coaches. So begs the question of what the coaches, whether the coaches knew what was going on. But the rookies go to the back of the bus, they're told to strip, and then they all are forced to get into the bathroom at the back of the bus and imagine 5 or 6, 16, 17 year old teenagers jammed in there without clothes on. The lights are turned off, some coins are thrown in through a vent, and they're told, you guys can only come out when you collect $3.25 and change for us. Well, the joke of it is there's only $0.95 worth of coins in there. So I've heard of anecdotes of players being in that situation for upwards of half an hour or more.</p>
</details>

主持人：我想谈谈那个年龄段。当新秀们，或者那些20多岁、时间所剩无几的球员，这种动态是如何发挥作用的？因为，你知道，那些20岁的球员也曾是16岁，也经历过这些。他们可能没有**国家冰球联盟**（National Hockey League）的球队在召唤他们。这种动态中是否存在一些因素也起了作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk a little bit about that age range. How does it play, whether the rookies or they're, you know, they're on borrowed time at that point when they're kind of in their 20s, that dynamic. Because, you know, those 20 year olds, they were they were ones who were 16 and went through it. They may not have an NHL team that's calling them. Is there something in that sort of dynamic there that plays into it as well?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：是的。好问题。我想是有的。我想如果你20或21岁还在打冰球，那就意味着你即将从青少年冰球运动员过渡到现实世界。这可能很可怕，因为你一直以来，你所认同的身份，就只是一个冰球运动员。所以，你知道，在某些情况下，再次，根据我从这些年轻人那里听到的，你会遇到20岁的球员想要利用这一点，确保这些年轻球员也必须经历他们曾经经历过的那些入会仪式。公平地说，我也听说过一些老将球员，20岁的球员，他们确保这种做法不再继续，对吧，并为这些即将进入青少年冰球的青少年创造一个更安全的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Good question. I think I think that there is I think if you're still playing hockey when you're 20 or 21, the writing's on the wall that you're about to have to make this transition away from being a junior hockey player into the real world. And that might be scary because all you've done, all you have identified yourself as, is a hockey player forever. And so, you know, in some cases, again, from what I've heard from these, these young men, you have situations where 20 year olds have wanted to take advantage of that and make sure that these young players coming up have to go through the same sorts of initiations that they had to. To be fair, I've also heard stories about, you know, players who are veterans, 20 who've ensured that that practice does not continue. Right, and that there is a safer environment for these teenagers coming up playing junior.</p>
</details>

### 沉默的文化及其后果

主持人：好的。我想读一段你的书中的引文，它谈到了“沉默的文化”。它写道：那些曾经忍受或施加伤害的年轻人并没有从这项运动中消失。他们是教练、球探、总经理以及球队和联盟的高管。从这些有影响力的位置上，他们常常在维持一种沉默的文化中扮演着一个安静但关键的角色。这种沉默的文化在冰球世界中是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. I want to read a quote from your book that talks about sort of the culture of silence. It goes the young men who once endured or inflicted harm have not disappeared from the game. They are coaches and scouts and general managers and team and league executives. From these perches of influence, they have too often played a quiet but pivotal role in sustaining a culture of silence. How is this culture of silence functioned in the hockey world?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：嗯，我无法告诉你我在采访中听到“**缄默法则**”（Omerta: 一种黑手党式的沉默守则，指对犯罪活动保持沉默）这个词的次数，你知道，这种整个概念，就是我们不谈论我们看到的坏事，这在青少年冰球中存在，在职业冰球中也存在。它甚至延伸到青少年冰球，因为家庭们非常害怕，如果他们站出来，你知道，即使是举报虐待或不当待遇，他们的孩子，那些仍然希望追逐梦想的孩子，就会被球队开除，他们会被列入黑名单，不被允许回到球队。我最近一两周写了一个故事，关于安大略省的一个案例，一个14岁以下的**AA级冰球队**（AA Hockey Team: 加拿大青少年冰球联赛中的一个级别，通常代表较高水平的竞技）的更衣室里，就像**《蝇王》**（Lord of the Flies: 威廉·戈尔丁的小说，描绘了人性在缺乏文明约束下的堕落）一样。有一个群组讨论，其中充满了种族主义、恐同和仇恨言论。有球员按住队友，拉下他们的裤子和内裤，拍摄他们的生殖器照片，而其他男孩则在更衣室门口站岗，以确保没有人进来。在这种情况下，教练，再次，加拿大冰球协会的规定是教练必须一直待在这些房间里。我认为这个案例确实说明了当你举报时会发生什么，因为这个故事的后续是，在一个家庭对此提出投诉并受到制裁之后，那个站出来投诉的年轻男孩在另一个冰球场遭到袭击，脸部被拳打。而那次袭击发生在这些制裁生效几天之后。这导致了另一次制裁，那个打他脸的男孩被停赛一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I can't tell you the number of times in my interviews that I heard the word omerta, you know, like this and this, this whole concept that, you know, we don't talk about the bad things that we see and that that that's in junior hockey, it's in professional hockey. It even extends down into minor hockey because families are petrified that if they come forward and they, you know, make a report even about abuse or maltreatment, that their children will be, you know, who are still hoping to chase the dream that their kids are going to be dropped from the teams and they'll be blackballed, blacklisted, and not welcome back on their teams. I wrote about a story only in the last couple, last week or so, about a case in Ontario where an under 14 AA hockey team within the locker room, it was like Lord of the Flies. There was a group, a group discussion where there were racist and homophobic and, you know, hate speech filled passages going on this group chat. There were players holding down their teammates and pulling down their their pants and their underwear and taking photos of their genitals while other boys were standing guard by the doors of the locker room to make sure that nobody was coming in. And in that case, the coach who again, the rules of Hockey Canada are the coaches. Coaches are supposed to be in these rooms all the time. And and I think that case really does illustrate what happens when you make a report, because the, the kind of the after afterward of that story is after a family made a complaint about this and after there were sanctions, the young boy who stood up and made the complaint was assaulted in another hockey rink, punched in the face. And it only came. That assault only came days after these sanctions came down. And that led to another sanction, where the boy who punched him in the face was suspended for a year.</p>
</details>

主持人：我知道，这本书的重点是冰球，但这是不是冰球独有的问题？这是否也发生在**AAU**（Amateur Athletic Union: 美国业余体育联盟）或其他篮球或其他运动中？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know that, you know, the book is focussed on hockey, but is this what is it about it being? Is it exclusively a hockey thing? Is this happening in AAU, in other sort of basketball, whether it's basketball or other sports?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：是的，我认为冰球界人士的本能反应是说这不仅仅是冰球问题，这是一个社会问题。这确实有道理。当然，它无处不在，对吧？看看我们读到的所有关于杰弗里·爱泼斯坦（Jeffrey Epstein）的故事。看看我们读到的所有关于哈维·温斯坦（Harvey Weinstein）的报道。在英格兰的足球界也存在类似问题。在美国的篮球和橄榄球中也存在类似问题。但是你知道吗？也有关于这些问题的报道。这些故事被记录下来，被讲述，问责问题也被报道。所以对我来说，问题是为什么我们不报道加拿大冰球界的问题呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, and I think that's the reflex of people within hockey is to say this isn't just a hockey problem, it's a societal problem. And there's truth in that. There really is. Of course, it happens everywhere, right? Look at all the stories that we read about Jeffrey Epstein. Look at all the stories that we've read about Harvey Weinstein that have been reported. There have been issues like this in soccer in England. There's issues around this in basketball, in football in the United States. But you know what? There's journalism about it as well. And these stories are documented. They're told, there's accountability issues that are reported on. And so to me the question is why wouldn't we report on it in Canada about hockey.</p>
</details>

主持人：如果前球员正在进入我们看到的领导职位，我们如何打破这个循环？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If former players are working their way into leadership positions that we are seeing, how do we break that cycle?</p>
</details>

Rick Westhead：嗯，我认为也有一些乐观的因素，而且我在这本书中记录了一些正在尝试以不同方式做这件事的项目。举个例子，在安大略省汉密尔顿市，**AA汉密尔顿钢铁队**（AA Hamilton Steel）和**AA汉密尔顿哈士奇队**（AA Hamilton Huskies）采用了在美国开始的一个项目，叫做**“将男孩培养成男子汉”**（Coaching Boys Into Men: 一项旨在通过体育教练指导青少年男性建立健康价值观的美国项目）。所以我去了那里。这个项目本赛季在汉密尔顿有16支球队正在运行。所有的教练都被教导如何与他们的球员谈论同意问题，健康的男子气概是什么样的，他们应该如何对待彼此，如何对待年轻女性。我实际上坐在那里观看了这些模块。我看着教练们与11、12岁的男孩谈论这些问题。我很好奇，这些男孩是从哪里听到这些信息的？当然，父母应该和他们的孩子谈论这些。但是，你知道，通过我的采访和询问人们，我知道很多人对此感到不舒服。这些他们应该和孩子进行的对话并没有发生。它们在学校发生吗？当然不总是。所以也许展望未来，这里的乐观理由是，如果像这样的项目能够启动并传播开来。也许冰球可以成为一个我们真正关心培养有品格的年轻人，就像我们关心培养能打好冰球的年轻人一样的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think there is some optimism to be found too, and there are efforts and I document them in this book about programs that are trying to do this differently. So for one example, in Hamilton, Ontario, the AA Hamilton Steel and AA Hamilton Huskies have bought into this program that started in the United States. It's called Coaching Boys Into Men. And so I went down. And the way this works this season, they have 16 teams in Hamilton that are running this program. So all the coaches are taught about how to speak to their players, about issues of consent, about what healthy masculinity looks like, how they should treat each other, how they should treat, you know, young women. And I actually sat in and watched these modules. I watched the coaches talk to boys 11 and 12 years old about these issues. And I wondered, where are the boys hearing these kinds of messages? Of course, parents should be talking to their kids about this. But, you know, I know just through my interviews and through asking people, a lot of people are uncomfortable. And these kinds of conversations they should be having with their kids are not happening. Are they happening in schools? Certainly not always. And so maybe moving forward, the reason for optimism here is if word about programs like this get off the ground and spread. Maybe hockey can be a place where we're actually as concerned about grooming young men of character as we are of grooming young men who can play hockey really well.</p>

### 竞技体育中的健康与不健康竞争

主持人：体育充满了励志格言。付出110%。没有痛苦，就没有收获。但对于一个在成功压力下的孩子来说，这些话听起来像什么？竞争何时停止健康，何时开始成为压力和困扰的原因？我向世界冠军跨栏运动员、播音员兼《我母亲的女儿》（"My Mother's Daughter"）一书的作者佩尔迪塔·费利西安（Perdita Felicia），以及与儿童、青少年和成人合作的临床心理学家安德鲁·王（Andrew Wong）请教了这些问题以及更多。佩尔迪塔，安德鲁，欢迎来到《The Rundown》。你们两位最近怎么样？

<p class="english-text">Sports is filled with motivational sayings. Give it 110%. No pain, no gain. But what do they sound like to a kid who's under pressure to succeed? When does competition stop being healthy and start being a cause of stress and distress? I asked Perdita Felicia, world champion hurdler, broadcaster and author of My Mother's Daughter, and Andrew Wong, a clinical psychologist who works with kids, teens, and adults. About this and more. Perdita. Andrew, welcome to The Rundown. How are you two doing?</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：很好。

</details>

主持人：好的，佩尔迪塔，我先问你。你曾在最高水平的比赛中竞争。你会说，作为年轻人，竞争是如何激励你的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Perdita, I'm coming to you first. You competed at the highest level. What would you say that competition motivated you as a young person?</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：你知道我会说什么吗？对我来说，我喜欢运动的社交方面。这就是你发现的。如果你看数据，比如，年轻女孩喜欢运动的社交方面，而男孩们对运动的动力更多是他们能把自己推到多远，考验自己。我说的是14岁之前，当我长大后，对吧？因为老实说，对我来说，运动可有可无。但当我长大后，直到我16、17、18、19岁时，我才觉得，哦，是的，我真的很喜欢做这个，但老实说，我做它是因为我所有的朋友都在做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what I would say? For me, I loved the social aspect of sport. And that's what you find. If you look at data, like, young girls love the social aspect of sports, whereas boys like their motivation for sports is really like how far they can push and test themselves. I'm talking about like before the age of 14 as I got older, right? Because I was honestly like something I could take or leave. But as I got older, it wasn't till I was like 16, 17, 18, 19 then like, oh yeah, like, I really love doing this, but I really did it because all my friends were doing it, to be honest.</p>
</details>

主持人：他们当时在做什么？我们在竞争什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What were they doing? What were we what were we competing in.</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：是的。哦，天哪，什么都试过。三年级时我参加了越野跑。那完全是失败。如果你有很多快肌纤维，不推荐。然后我做了三级跳远，协调性糟透了。我知道这听起来可能不合逻辑，但我无法完成跳、跨、跳的部分。跳远我做得很好。甚至尝试了跳高，我身高不高，大概五英尺五英寸，但我获得了地区第三名，这在我的简历上就像一个新兴运动员一样。只是想说，我什么都做了，因为那很酷，我的朋友们都在做。然后，你知道，我接触了跨栏，我根本不想做。我的教练让我做跨栏。他只教我跨栏。我就是这样成为一个非常不情愿的跨栏运动员的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So oh my goodness everything. Like I tried out for cross country in grade three. That was an absolute fail. Don't recommend if you like. Have a lot of like fast twitch fibres. And then I did triple jump was horribly like awfully coordinated. I know it seems like it doesn't make sense further, but I couldn't do the hop skip jump part. Long jump was really good at it. Even tried high jump and I'm not that tall. I'm like five-five, but I got like third place in the region and work on my résumé as like an emerging athlete, just to say, like I did everything because it was cool and my friends were doing it. And then, you know, I had I got to the hurdles, didn't want to do it at all. And my coach made me do the hurdles. He would only coach me in hurdles. And that's how I became a very reluctant hurdler.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，就是这样。好的。安德鲁，当然，不仅仅是体育。我们知道学校里也有竞争，如果你有兄弟姐妹。我有一个哥哥。我们之间本身就存在着内部竞争。竞争氛围如何影响年轻人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, there we go. All right. Well, Andrew, it's not just sports. Of course. We know in school there is competition if you have siblings. I have an older brother. We there is an internal competition right there in itself. How can a competitive atmosphere affect young people?</p>
</details>

Andrew Wong：嗯，我想你一针见血地指出了这一点。大自然有一种内置机制叫做兄弟姐妹。他们促进这种健康的竞争。或者他们可以，我认为就像在体育运动中一样，有时你需要裁判介入。对于兄弟姐妹来说，那就是父母。我认为谈到兄弟姐妹，重要的是要理解他们会互相推动，对吧。但同时，我们希望看到的是这种健康的解决问题的方式，会有欢声笑语，会有解决问题，他们会自己解决问题。父母会时不时地介入说，好吧，我得帮你们解决一下问题了。但我确实相信，研究表明，那些建立了积极兄弟姐妹关系的人，可以在体育运动中建立积极的关系，就像佩尔迪塔说的那样，你知道，社交方面非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think I think you hit it on the on the nail on the head there. Nature has this built-in mechanism called siblings. And they promote this healthy competition. Or they can and I think just like in sports, sometimes you need the referees who come in. And for siblings it's the parents. And I think when it comes to siblings, what is so important to understand is that they will push each other right. But at the same time, what we hope to see is this sort of healthy problem solving as well, that there will be laughter and there will be problem solving, and they sort of work things out. And from time to time, parents will hop in and say, okay, I'm gonna have to help you guys problem solve a little bit. But this is where I do believe, and the research has shown that those who form these positive sibling relationships can go out there and form these positive relationships in sport, just like Perdita was saying, you know, the social aspect is so important.</p>

### 父母的角色：平衡竞技与成长

主持人：好的，佩尔迪塔，你是一位母亲。向六岁半的诺瓦（Nova）致敬。知道你作为运动员一生承受了多大的压力，你会希望你自己的孩子也承受那种压力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Perdita, you are a parent. Shout out to six and a half year old Nova. Knowing how much pressure you were under through your life as an athlete, would you want to see your own child deal with that kind of pressure?</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：你知道，这是个好问题，谢谢你把“半”加在六岁半上。这对诺瓦来说非常重要。我会说我们让她尝试了所有的事情，比如游泳、网球、花样滑冰。她都做过。实际上，在她五岁左右的时候，我想她听到有人说，她就像是，妈妈，我只是个孩子。我做了太多事情。我当时想，哦，他好像有点想要。我知道。我当时想，哦，我有点想让她拥有我没有过的所有东西和经历，因为我有点，你知道，只做了田径。那是我能负担得起的。所以关于压力这部分，小诺瓦可能感受到了其中的一些，实际上我们减少了。她现在只做游泳和花样滑冰，这就足够了。她喜欢这两件事。但我要说的是，压力必须是适合年龄的。现在我不喜欢看到的是，你知道，你看到这些年轻运动员，九岁、八岁、十四岁，就像是青少年运动的专业化。他们有营养师和教练。我实际上认为那是不健康的。它可能导致倦怠。它也可能导致他们不是真正为了自己而做，而是为了取悦教练或取悦父母。我认为父母和我们身边所有有小孩的人都需要关注这一点。我们是为了自己而做，还是真正为了他们和他们的乐趣？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, that's a good question, and thank you for putting the half on the six and a half. That's very important to Nova. I will say that we've thrown her in everything like swimming, you know, tennis, figure skating. She's done all the things. And it actually when she was around five, she I think she heard someone saying that she's like, mama, I'm just a child. I'm doing too many things. And I was like, oh, he's like, kind of wanted. I know. I was like, oh, I kind of want her to have all the things and the experiences I didn't have because I kind of just, you know, did track. It was something I could afford. So about the pressure piece, little Nova probably feel some of that and actually pared it back. She's just doing swimming right now and figure skating and that's enough. The two things she loves. But I will say this the pressure has to be age appropriate right now. What I don't like seeing is the fact that, you know, you see these these young athletes, nine, eight, 14, it's like it's become a professionalisation of youth sport. They have the nutritionist and the coaches. And I actually think that's unhealthy. It can lead to burnout. It also can lead to them not really doing it for them doing it to like please a coach or please a parent. I think parents and all of us who have littles around us need to kind of keep an eye on that. Are we doing it for us or is it really about them and their enjoyment?</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，安德鲁，我想让你接着佩尔迪塔刚才说的，但请帮助我们理解健康竞争和不健康竞争的区别是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Andrew, I'm going to get you to pick up on what Perdita said there, but help us understand what's the difference between healthy and unhealthy competition?</p>
</details>

Andrew Wong：健康竞争。重要的是要关注努力，关注技能发展，表扬的积极强化，以及庆祝孩子相对的成就。我想很多时候，我的意思是，这是人类天性的一部分。我们会比较。我办公室里经常有父母说，哦，我希望我不要比较，但我就是会。我总是提醒他们，我们确实会比较，这没关系。但我们必须意识到这一点。这是一种健康的比较还是不健康的比较。对吧。所以当我们谈论健康竞争时，就是要知道，好吧，我们要庆祝这种相对的成就。如果他们从未在花样滑冰中跳过**阿克塞尔跳**（Axel: 花样滑冰中的一种跳跃动作，以向前起跳和向后落冰为特点），这是第一次，我们就要庆祝。这不重要，你知道，如果冰场另一边的另一个孩子正在做**两周半阿克塞尔跳**（Double Axel: 花样滑冰中完成两周半空中旋转的阿克塞尔跳），对吧？这不重要。然后对于不健康竞争，它的关键在于过分强调输赢。我认为现在竞争的层次太多了。就像佩尔迪塔说的，我的意思是，你可以有一个六岁的孩子，被选中参加，你知道，冰球的单A队、双A队。这对孩子来说意味着什么？所以当我们进入那个层面时，问题就来了，因为现在我们只是强调输赢。我们必须强调乐趣、学习和技能发展。你知道，有时当我们给孩子施加太多压力时，我们会强调，哦，你做错了这个，你做错了那个。你必须做得更好。我们间接地产生了这种羞耻感。所以当他们感到羞耻时，他们现在害怕犯错。现在他们只是在玩，就像佩尔迪塔之前提到的，为了取悦教练，为了取悦父母，你知道。哦，我进了三个球。我今天会得到表扬。我一个球都没进，那回家路上会很难过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Healthy competition. It's so important to focus on the effort to focus on the skill development, the positive reinforcements of praise and celebrating the relative achievement of that child. I think so many times, I mean, it's built into to human nature. We will compare. I get parents in my office all the time saying, oh, I wish I didn't compare, but I do. And I always remind them, we do, we compare and that's okay. But we have to be aware of that. And is it a healthy comparison or not. Right. And so when we talk about healthy competition, it's knowing that, okay, we are going to celebrate that relative achievement. If they've never jumped an axle with foreign figure skating and this is the first time we celebrate, that doesn't matter if you know, another child on the other side of the rink is doing a double axel, right? It doesn't matter. And then with unhealthy competition, the piece around that, there's just so much emphasis on winning and losing. And I think nowadays there's so many different levels of competition. Like Perdido is saying, I mean, you can have a six year old who is being chosen for, you know, a single, a team, a double, a team in hockey. And what does that even mean to the child? And so when we go into that level, it becomes problematic because now we're just emphasising winning and losing. We have to emphasise the fun and the learning and the skill development. You know, sometimes when we put too much pressure on kids, we emphasise, oh, you did this wrong, you did that wrong. You have to do this better. And we indirectly produce this notion of shame. And so when they be, when they feel shame, now they're scared of making mistakes. Now they're only playing, as Perdita mentioned before, to please the coach, to please the parent, you know. Oh, I scored three goals. I'm going to get praised today. I didn't score any goals that that's going to be a tough one. On the car ride home.</p>
</details>

主持人：佩尔迪塔，我想听听你的看法。你认为健康竞争和不健康竞争的区别是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Perdita, I want to get your take. What do you think the difference is between healthy and unhealthy competition?</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：你知道，我经历过各种水平的体育运动，从基层、新兴、精英到职业，我的工作也持续了很长时间。我见过一些教练，他们是运动员能够脱颖而出的原因。所以，我给你一个快速的理解。我有一个世界级的精英训练伙伴，时间很长，所以我代表加拿大参赛。我不会说出她的名字。她代表另一个国家参赛，但我们当时在大学。她表现很好，然后她会回去参加职业赛季，比如说奥运会或世锦赛。我们回去，所以。所以我会在那里见到她，你知道，我们不在训练营，但我们会像，比如说奥运会、世界锦标赛，无论那一年在哪里举行。她就是无法集中精力。她甚至进不了决赛。这让我非常困惑。我记得我问我的教练，为什么她回家后就表现不好？结果是因为她的教练非常紧张，压力很大，对她大喊大叫，导致她在压力下的表现能力很低。所以当你看到一个运动员真的无法正常化，不允许失败时，你就会看到那些不健康的环境。如果你看到你年轻的新兴运动员看着你这个父母，或者看着你这个教练寻求确认，他们是否应该移动，他们是否应该做出这个动作。我是否应该，你知道，要求下场。这些事情开始变得非常不健康，因为那个孩子无法为自己做决定。你想要，就像安德鲁说的，拥有一个环境，你知道，孩子感到自由，他们享受其中。这很有趣。我想强调的另一件事是，我们必须将错误正常化，对吧？你必须将错误正常化。人们讨厌这个词。我喜欢“失败”这个词。没关系。与其对你的孩子吹毛求疵、分析，不如说，哦，天哪，看到你今天做得真棒。你知道，每当诺瓦下冰场时，你知道她还不是一个出色的滑冰运动员，但我梦想着她也许会成为一名多产的花样滑冰运动员，我正在投射，我正在投射。但我想说的是，一旦她下冰场，我就会问她，感觉怎么样？看起来很棒，我喜欢，我不会滑冰，但你六岁半，你会。所以我想你必须真正审视自己，作为父母和教练，然后确保孩子真的是出于正确的原因在做这件事。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, I've been through, like, every level of sport, grassroots, emerging, elite, professional with my job for a long time. And I have seen some coaches that have been the reason that athletes can excel. So I'll give you a quick, quick understanding. I had a a world class and elite training partner for a really long time, and so I competed for Canada. I won't say her name. She competed for another country, but so we were in university. She'd do great and then she'd go back for the professional season, let's say Olympics or worlds. We go back and so. So I'd see her, you know, we weren't at camps, but we'd be like, let's say the Olympics, the World Championships, wherever they were that year. And she could not get it together. Like she wouldn't even make a final. And it was so confusing to me. And I remember asking my coach, like, why is it when she goes back home, like she doesn't perform? And it came down to her coach being so high strung, so stressful yelling at her that her ability to perform under pressure was low. And so you see those unhealthy environments when an athlete really can't normalise, failure is not allowed to fail. If you see your young emerging athlete looking over at you as the parent or looking at you as the coach for confirmation, if they should move, they should make this play. Should I, you know, ask to come off the field. Those are the things that are starting to really become unhealthy because that child's not able to make decisions for themselves. You want, like Andrew said, to have this environment where you know, the child feels free, they're enjoying themselves. It's fun. And the other thing I want to stress, and I'll say this is we have to normalise mistakes, right? You have to normalise. And people hate this word. I love this word failure. It's okay. And instead of saying to your child nitpicking and analysing, just say, oh my goodness, it was great to see what you did today. You know, whenever Nova comes off the ice, you know she's not a great skater yet, but I have dreams of her maybe, you know, being a prolific figure skater, I'm projecting, I'm projecting. But the point I'm trying to say is, once she gets off the ice, I ask her, like, how did it feel? It looked great, I love it, I can't skate, but you're six and a half and you can. So I think you have to really check yourself as the parent and the coach and then make sure that child is really doing it for the right reasons.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的。安德鲁，佩尔迪塔提到了体育的商业化。体育发展得如此之快。你认为父母是否感到有压力，要让他们的孩子参加竞技体育，或者拿起相机拍摄精彩集锦上传到YouTube，以便球探们能看到，因为我们知道球探们正在关注。但父母们是否感受到了这种压力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Andrew, Perdita had mentioned the commercialisation of sports. Sports has grown so much. Do you think parents are feeling pressured to put their kids in competitive sports, or grab that camera to film that highlight reel to post on YouTube? So the scouts are watching because we know scouts are watching. But do parents feel that pressure?</p>
</details>

Andrew Wong：哦，天哪。绝对是。所以自我披露一下。我有一个七岁的孩子和一个九岁的孩子，九岁的孩子也是一名花样滑冰运动员。甚至她有时也会问，嘿，我的俱乐部有没有把我的视频发布出去？对吧？然后我七岁的孩子想尝试参加精选棒球队。所以，是的，有很多商业化。我认为这在当今是一个巨大的部分。是的，金钱是一个因素。每个俱乐部，每个联盟都想盈利。所以你会有，就像我之前说的，四个不同级别的冰球，四个不同级别的棒球。每个人都在努力招募。所以我确实认为这是一个巨大的因素。再加上社交媒体也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my goodness. Absolutely. So just some self-disclosure. I have a seven year old and a nine year old, and the nine year old is a figure skater as well. And even she sometimes asks, hey, did my club put that video of me out there? Right? And then you have my seven year old who wanted to try out for select baseball. And so, yeah, there's a lot of commercialisation. That's a huge part of it nowadays, I think. Yeah, money is a factor. Every club, every league wants to generate profit. And so you have, like I said before, like four different levels of hockey, four different levels of baseball. And everybody is trying to recruit. So I do think that's a that's a huge factor. Plus social media too.</p>
</details>

### 培养多重身份，超越输赢

主持人：好的。在剩下的几分钟里，佩尔迪塔，你有什么建议可以分享给年轻人或在场的成年人，关于如何在输赢的起伏中保持自我价值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. In the last few minutes that we have Perdita, do you have any advice to share for youth or the adults in the room on how to maintain your self-worth during the ups and downs of winning and losing?</p>
</details>

Perdita Felicia：我喜欢这个问题。我认为你必须使孩子的身份多样化。所以如果家庭中唯一的焦点是他们成为冰球明星，拥有冰场和任何比赛场地，我认为你让你的孩子处于劣势。因为事实是，绝大多数人不会去参加奥运会，也不会赢得**斯坦利杯**（Stanley Cup: 国家冰球联盟的年度冠军奖杯，是冰球界最高荣誉之一）。抱歉打破了那些花了几千美元在这些事情上的爸爸妈妈们的梦想。去做吧。热爱它的发展理念。但重点是，如果那是目标，那是想法。不。所以我认为你真的必须审视自己，然后说，不，我这样做是因为我的运动员将从体育中学习到一些永远对他们有益的东西。我记得我从九岁时在俱乐部田径队学到的东西，以及十八岁时在大学学到的东西，那就是，现在我有了责任感。如果我说我要做某事，我就会去做。另外，如果我长时间没有锻炼，我也可以回到跑步机上重新开始。这些只是努力。这就像我能够做事情并努力去适应不适，这些都是终身课程。我没有所有这些，你知道，奖牌挂在周围，但实际上我有。抱歉，我的意思是，不是每个人都有所有这些奖牌挂在周围，对吧？但重点是，比这些生锈、布满灰尘的奖牌更持久的是，我内在的成长动力和变得更好的愿望。所以这真的必须是你作为父母做这件事的原因。并且确保最终，你没有把你想要的东西投射到你的孩子身上。让他们有自己的目标和梦想。如果，是的，他们成为了下一个**西德尼·克罗斯比**（Sidney Crosby: 加拿大著名职业冰球运动员）或下一个佩尔迪塔·费利西安。安伯·莫利（Amber Morely），说得好。是的，很棒。但只是为他们做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that question. I think that you have to diversify your child's identities. And so if the only focus in the household is them being a hockey grade, a hockey star and having the rink and whatever the arena of play is, I think you do your child a disadvantage. Because here's the truth majority of the human population does not go to the Olympics, does not go and win a Stanley Stanley Cup. Sorry to break it to you moms and dads spending all these thousands of dollars on these things. Do it. Love the development idea of it. But the point is, if that is the goal, that's the idea. No. So I think you really have to check yourself and be like, no, I'm doing this because there are things my athlete is going to learn from sport that will serve them forever. And there's things I remember learning from, you know, when I was nine in club track and then when I was, you know, 18 in university where it's like, now I'm accountable. If I say I'm going to do something, I say it. Also, when I've not worked out for a long time, I can get back on a treadmill and do it again. These are just the effort. It's like me able to do things and try hard to be uncomfortable are lifelong lessons. I don't have all these, you know, medals hanging around, but well, actually I do. Sorry, not everybody has all these medals hanging around is what I meant to say, right? But the point is, what is what's more lasting than these rusty, dusty medals is really those kind of the intrinsic motivation I have to grow myself and to be better. And so that really has to be why you do it as a parent. And just make sure at the end of the day, that you're not projecting what you want on your for yourself onto your child. Let them have their own goals and their own dreams. And if, yeah, they go on to be the next Sidney Crosby or the next Perdita Felicien. Touché, Amber Morely. Yes, great. But just do it. Just do it for them.</p>
</details>

主持人：安德鲁，你知道，很多人都很难接受“输赢不是一切”这句话。成年人、年轻人、父母，无论是什么人。父母如何帮助他们的孩子理解这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Andrew, that, you know, a lot of people have a hard time with the phrase, you know, winning isn't everything. Adults, youth, parents, whatever it be. How can parents help their kids figure this one out?</p>
</details>

Andrew Wong：我认为首先最重要的是，让他们玩。让他们在外面享受乐趣。你知道，这种“输赢不是一切”的观念。这是真的。回到佩尔迪塔所说的，抱歉，这是关于在他们一生中建立韧性的能力。将他们从体育中学习到的东西带入日常生活。韧性。什么是韧性，对吧。它是能够说“我能做困难的事情”的能力。我能寻求帮助。我合作的一些运动员，他们非常害怕寻求帮助，因为他们认为必须自己完成。但研究表明，韧性是建立在能够足智多谋和寻求帮助的基础上的。所以这也意味着他们可以对他人脆弱，并信任那些比他们更了解的人。所以能够通过体育运动获得这一点，我热爱体育，因为它教会了太多关于生活的东西。所以当他们进入工作世界时，你知道，他们能否寻求帮助，而不是试图自己解决问题？我希望他们能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think first and foremost, let them play. Let them enjoy themselves out there. You know, this this idea that, you know, winning isn't everything. It's true. Going back to what Perdita was saying, sorry, it's being able to build resilience throughout their lives. Take what they can learn from sport into everyday life. Resilience. What is resilience, right. It's the ability to be able to say, I can do hard things. I can ask for help. Some of the athletes who I work with, they are so scared to ask for help because they think they have to do it on their own. But research has shown that resilience is built on being able to be resourceful and to ask for help. So that also means that they can be vulnerable to others and trust others that they know better. And so being able to take that away through sport, I love sports because it teaches so much about life. So when they go out into the work world, you know, can they ask for help instead of trying to figure things out on their own? I hope they can.</p>
