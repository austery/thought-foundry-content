title: 关税如何影响今年的节日购物季？

### 关税对节日购物的“千刀万剐”效应

这就像是**千刀万剐**（death by a thousand cuts: 指一系列小而累积的负面事件最终导致重大失败或损害）。可能这里多了几美元，那里多了几美元，你在购物时可能根本不会注意到。然而，当你累计计算你总共花了多少钱时，你可能会想：“这些钱都去哪儿了？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is death by a thousand cuts. Okay, it may be a couple dollars here, a couple dollars there. As you're shopping, you may actually not notice. And then when you think about how much you've spent in the cumulative, you're like, where did all that go?</p>
</details>

我是 Christine Sirette，我是 Kyra Blackwell，我是 Rosie Garin，您正在收听的是《Wirecutter Show》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm Christine Sirette. I'm Kyra Blackwell. I'm Rosie Garin. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.</p>
</details>

Rosie，今天只有我们俩在演播室，Kyra 不在。我想她会非常喜欢今天的对话，因为我们今天要谈论的是优惠，节日优惠。现在是十一月，很多人可能正在考虑或已经开始考虑他们的节日购物了。你是一个购物的提前规划者吗？你会提前购物，还是会等到临近假期才开始呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rosie, it's just us in the studio today. We flying solo without Kyra. And I think she would actually love this conversation because we are talking about deals today. Holiday deals. It's November. A lot of people are probably thinking about their or starting to think about their holiday shopping. Are you a pre-planner for shopping? Do you shop ahead of time or do you wait kind of closer to to the holidays?</p>
</details>

Rosie: 我是混合型的，你知道，我是一个特立独行的人，我无法被束缚。不，我确实喜欢全年都列购物清单。但不可避免地，总会有那么一刻，当离假期只剩两周，而我还没有完成清单时，我就会感到恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am a mix. You know, I'm a maverick. I sort of can't be pinned down. No, I do like keeping lists. Throughout the year, but there is inevitably that moment where I'm panicked because it's two weeks out and I haven't gotten through the list.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的，我也有类似的做法。我会列一些清单，但我历来不是一个**黑色星期五**（Black Friday: 感恩节后的第一个星期五，美国零售业的年度大促销日）的大买家。尽管如此，今年我确实为我的孩子们列了一份清单，一直在寻找一些优惠。所以，我认为现在是与一位真正了解优惠以及今年购物预期的人交流的好时机。而且我认为今年的情况会与往年有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I tend to do something similar. I'll I'll keep some lists. I am not historically a big Black Friday shopper. That said, this year I do have a list of things that I'm looking for for my kids that I have been looking for some deals on. So, I think this is a great time for us to talk with somebody who really knows a lot about deals and what to expect this year. And I think it's going to be a little bit different than it has been in years past.</p>
</details>

Rosie: 是的，我想这可能是真的。在过去一年里，我们节目专门做了两期关于**关税**（tariffs: 国家对进出口商品征收的税费）及其与消费品定价之间联系的节目，这些节目都是基于**Wirecutter**（Wirecutter: 《纽约时报》旗下的产品评测网站，以提供深入的产品评测和购物建议闻名）的记者们，他们试图弄清一个问题：关税是否会影响我想要和需要购买的商品价格，如果会，又是如何影响的？那些对话曾推测这个节日购物季可能会受到怎样的影响，但现在它已经来临了。所以，我认为是时候真正审视我们所处的情况以及未来一个半月会是怎样的了。休息回来后，我们将与 Ann Marie Conte 交流。她是 Wirecutter 的副编辑，她曾负责我们的优惠团队，现在负责各种主题的报道，从在我们的“Ask Wirecutter”专栏中回答读者问题，到探究为什么铅笔橡皮擦如此糟糕。你一定要看看她做的这个系列，它真的很棒。她最近的一篇文章就是关于在关税影响下，这个时期会发生什么。这篇文章名为《Wirecutter 的节日季关税导航指南》（Wirecutter's Guide to Navigating Tariffs this Holiday Season）。我认为这正是我们今天将要讨论的核心。没错，我们将分解 Ann Marie 发现价格波动最大的产品类别，并讨论一些你可能想在今年假期购物时考虑的策略。所以，休息回来后，Ann Marie Conte 将会回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's probably true. We've done two episodes on this show within the last year specifically about tariffs and their connection to consumer product pricing and that's been based on wire cutter journalists who are trying to kind of get to the bottom of this question. Will tariffs affect the prices of the things I want and I need to buy and if so how? Those conversations kind of speculated how this holiday shopping season might be affected. But now it's upon us. So, I think it's time to sort of really look at where we're at and what the next month and a half is going to look like. After the break, we're going to talk with Ann Marie Conte. She is a deputy editor here at Wire Cutter. And she used to run our deals team and now reports on a variety of subjects from answering reader questions in our Ask Wire Cutter column to figuring out why pencil erasers are so bad. You need to look at this series she did. It's really great. and her most recent piece is all about what to expect during this time with tariffs. It's called Wire Cutters Guide to Navigating Tariffs this holiday season. And I think that's really the crux of what we're going to talk about today. That's right. We're going to break down some of the product categories where Annie has seen the most price volatility and talk about some shopping strategies that you might want to consider heading into the holidays this year. So after the break and Marie Conte be right back.</p>

### 关税对商品价格的实际影响

欢迎回来。我们正式进入了节日购物季，特别是黑色星期五，是许多人寻找优惠的时候。今年的情况看起来有点不同，主要是因为关税正在影响产品价格。我们今天的嘉宾是 Wirecutter 的副编辑 Ann Marie Conte。我们正在讨论她最新发表的文章《Wirecutter 的节日季关税导航指南》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome back. We are officially into the holiday shopping season and Black Friday in particular is a time many of us are looking for deals. This year what it looks like is a little bit different largely because of how tariffs are impacting product prices. Our guest today is deputy editor at Wire Cutter, Anmarie Conte. We're talking about her newest article, Wire Cutters Guide to Navigating Tariffs this holiday season.</p>
</details>

Christine: Ann Marie，欢迎回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ann Marie, welcome back.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 哦，我很高兴能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I'm so excited to be here.</p>
</details>

Christine: 很高兴有你。我一直很喜欢你来节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's great to have you. I always love it when you're on the show.</p>
</details>

Christine: Ann Marie，在我们深入探讨本季关税和购物的细节之前，我想知道，这份报道可能不是每个人的兴趣所在，但你却全身心投入其中。能谈谈你的背景，以及为什么这不会让你感到无聊吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Marie, before we jump in to the nitty-gritty on on tariffs and shopping this season, I want to know this reporting specifically might not be everyone's cup of tea. You have delved deep into it with both feet. Talk about your background a little bit and why this doesn't put you to sleep.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: Rosie，我非常震惊，不是每个人都像我一样对关税感到兴奋。我是一个非常节俭的人，对吧？我从小在一个非常重视价值的家庭长大。所以当我来到 Wirecutter 时，金钱、价值和优惠对我来说是与生俱来的，对 Wirecutter 来说也是如此。我们真的希望人们永远不会后悔他们的购买，并能物有所值。这不一定只意味着花最少的钱。你可以放纵和挥霍一些东西，但你必须明智地去做。所以，这就是让我真正兴奋的事情。我不喜欢人们为某件东西支付过高的价格，或者感觉自己被欺骗了。最好的感觉是，你买到了一件非常棒、非常有用且价格非常好的东西。回到六月，你参加了我们的节目，谈论你和优惠团队一直在进行的这个优惠追踪项目，你们追踪了 40 个 Wirecutter 精选产品。当时，你已经追踪这些价格大约两个月了，对吧？现在你已经追踪了它们将近六个月了，都是同样的产品。在六月的时候，情况是变化不大，但可能即将发生一些变化。我们现在处于什么状况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rosie, I am deeply shocked that not everyone is as excited about tariffs as I am. I'm a massive cheapkate, right? And so I was definitely grew up in a household where value was really important to us. And so when I came to Wire Cutter and you know money and value and deals is very inherent to who I am and it's inherent to Wire Cutter. We really want people to never regret their purchases and to get the most for their money. And that doesn't necessarily only mean spending the least amount possible. You can indulge and splurge on things, but you have to be smart about it. And so this is the stuff that gets me really jazzed. And what I don't like is people overpaying for something or feeling like they've been hoodwinkedked. The best feeling is feeling like you got something that's really great, really useful for a really good price. Back in June, you joined us on the show to talk about this deals tracking project that you and the deals team have been working on where you tracked 40 wire cutter picks. And at that point, you had been tracking those prices for about two months, right? And now you've been tracking them for almost six months. the same products. In June, the story was not much has changed, but there might be some changes coming down the pike. Where are we at now?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 这真是个惊喜。变化既大又小。总的来说，价格并没有像我们预期的那样大幅波动，我们看到了高峰和低谷。一些公司能够获得豁免。例如**苹果**（Apple: 跨国科技公司），他们不必提高价格，因为他们获得了关税豁免，但如果这些豁免不延长，价格可能会上涨。所以我们仍然处于一种观望的状态。情况在个体上有所变化，但并非普遍如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was a real surprise. It's changed both a lot and a little. Broadly, prices haven't moved as much as we thought they would, and we've seen the peaks and the valleys. Some companies were able to get exceptions. So Apple, they haven't had to increase their prices because they got exemptions to the tariffs, but if they don't get extended, those prices might go up. So we are still in this position of a little bit of wait and see. Things have changed individually, but not necessarily broadly.</p>
</details>

Christine: 那么，当你们的优惠团队进行追踪时，你们追踪的是各种各样的产品，对吧？这些产品涵盖了多个产品类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you did that tracking, when the deals team did that tracking, you were looking at a diverse array of products, right? Like these were things across multiple product categories.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 是的，我们确实想挑选那些你经常购买的大宗商品。所以我们追踪了像洗衣机烘干机这样的东西，还有婴儿和儿童产品，比如汽车座椅。这些产品的价格都上涨了。我们当时只是挑选我们认为最好的产品，所以它代表了某人的日常生活，但不一定代表会受关税影响的产品，因为那时我们还不太清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And we really wanted to pick things that you would buy frequently and larger purchases. So we did have things like a washer dryer in there and then we also had baby kid products uh like car seats. Those have increased. We were just picking what we thought was best at the time. And so it was emblematic of someone's daily life but not necessarily of what would be affected by tariffs cuz we didn't really know at that point.</p>
</details>

Christine: 但你们仍在追踪那 40 种产品。所以你们已经追踪了大约六个月了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you're still tracking those same 40 products. And so it's been about 6 months now since you've been tracking them.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 是的。婴儿和儿童产品的价格有所上涨。任何用钢材制造的东西，关税对那个行业打击很大，但我们主要看到的是正常的价格波动和优惠定价。我认为人们需要知道的另一点是，价格无论如何都会根据优惠周期或一年中的时间正常波动。我们没有看到太多异常情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. And so the baby kid products have increased a bit. Um and anything made with steel, uh the tariffs have hit that industry pretty hard, but mostly we're seeing normal price fluctuations and deal pricing. That's the other thing that I think people need to know is that prices fluctuate normally anyway depending on the deal cycle or depending on the time of year. We are not seeing too many aberrations around that.</p>
</details>

Christine: 你认为普通消费者今年上网购物或去实体店购物时，会被他们看到的价格吓到吗？或者你认为这只是一点点小幅上涨？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think the average shopper is going to get online this year or go into a brickandmortar store and go shopping and be sticker shocked by prices they're seeing or do you think it's kind of like sort of a little bump?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 这就是**千刀万剐**。可能这里几美元，那里几美元。当你购物时，你可能不会真正注意到，然后当你想到你总共花了多少钱时，你会想：“那些钱都去哪儿了？”我认为这就是为什么普通人还没有完全看到我们一直在看到的那些涨幅，因为我们一年中的每一天都在关注这些东西。但在某些商品上，价格确实显著上涨了。实际上，非常有趣的是，我采访的一个消息来源告诉我，最初关税宣布时，人们在“降级消费”，也就是说他们购买更便宜的产品，但随着经济并没有像大家想象的那么糟糕，这种情况就趋于平稳了。我认为人们一开始是有点紧张，然后情况就稳定下来了。现在我们不是在谈论杂货，也不是在谈论类似的东西。我认为人们在那里确实看到了价格冲击。绝对如此。我们谈论的是日常家居用品、礼品。那么，回到基础知识，我想知道关税是如何直接影响产品定价的。也许这并不是基础知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is death by a thousand cuts. It may be a couple dollars here, a couple dollars there. As you're shopping, you may actually not notice and then when you think about how much you've spent in the cumulative, like where did all that go? I think that's why the average person hasn't quite seen those increases that we've been seeing because we look at this stuff every single day of the year. But on some items, things have gotten significantly more expensive. The actually really interesting thing is one of the sources that I interviewed told me that initially when the tariffs were announced, people were what they called trading down. So they were buying less expensive products, but that leveled out as the economy wasn't necessarily as bad as everyone thought it was going to be. I think people were sort of girding themselves at the beginning and then things leveled out. Now we're not talking groceries. We're not talking about things like that. I think people are really seeing the sticker shock there. Absolutely. We're talking about everyday household products, gifts. So, running it back 101. I want to know how do tariffs directly affect product pricing. Maybe that isn't 101.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 所以，**特朗普总统**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）在竞选时就以关税为纲领。他在就职当天说：“我们要实行关税。”对吧？通常情况下，关税是在进口时支付的。所以它不是由制造商支付的，而是由我们作为商品进入这个国家时支付的。实际上这里有几件事在发生，这并不是基础知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, President Trump campaigned on tariffs. He on inauguration day, he said, "We're instituting the tariffs." Right? Generally, that is paid upon import. So, it's not paid by the manufacturer. It's paid by us as things come into the country. There's actually a couple of things going on here. It's not a 101.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 所以，这取决于它是否是某个组件，这会增加价格，因为这些制造商需要在一个更大的产品中使用这些组件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So depending on if it's something that's a component that can increase the price because these manufacturers need to use these components in a larger product.</p>
</details>

Christine: 比如芯片之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like a chip or something like that.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 是的，你知道，床垫里的钢线圈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You know, steel coils in a mattress.</p>
</details>

Christine: 好的。但也有针对更大范围商品类别的关税。所以很难确定。情况一直在变化，谈判也在进行。因此，这也一直很困难。这些制造商和品牌一直无法为这一年做出计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. But also there are tariffs on larger and more broad categories of goods as well. So it's really hard to pin down. Things are changing. Negotiations happen. And so that's also been hard. These manufacturers and these brands have been unable to plan for the year.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 所以有时候他们会说，我们别无选择，不得不提高价格。但他们曾试图在关税生效前尽可能多地进口商品，将其存放在美国境内，然后销售这些库存。所以现在我们到了一个库存已经售罄的阶段，接下来他们将不得不进口更多商品，并且必须弄清楚什么是有意义的。但这就像是盲目尝试。而那种囤积商品的举动，理想情况下是为了不将价格转嫁给消费者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there are times when they say our hand is forced. We had to increase prices. But what they tried to do was import as much as they could before the tariffs took effect, hold them stateside and sell through that stock. And so now we're at a point where that stock has been sold down and what's going to happen next is they're going to have to import more goods and they have to figure out what makes sense. But it's like throwing spaghetti at the wall. And that kind of stockpile move ideally was so that prices weren't passed over to the consumer.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的。他们希望情况会以某种方式转变和变化，从而使他们能够保持稳定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And they were hoping that things would shift and change in a way that would allow them to just remain steady.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 在某些情况下，这确实奏效了，而在其他情况下，特别是小型企业不得不表示我们再也无法承担这笔成本了。大型制造商和大型品牌更有能力将成本分摊到他们的产品中。但有趣的是，早在四月，特朗普总统曾被引述说（我是在转述），孩子们今年可能只能有两个娃娃了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In some cases that has worked and in other cases, especially small businesses have had to say we just can't absorb this cost anymore. Larger manufacturers, larger brands are more able to spread the cost out across their products. But the interesting thing is that back in April, President Trump was quoted as saying, I'm paraphrasing, like the kids will have to have just two dolls this year, right?</p>
</details>

Christine: 你猜怎么着？**美泰**（Mattel: 全球最大的玩具制造商之一）不得不提高了他们娃娃的价格。这在某种程度上确实很有预见性。你知道，**美国女孩娃娃**（American Girl dolls: 美国美泰公司旗下品牌，以其历史背景和多样性娃娃闻名）不得不涨价了，我想，每个娃娃涨了 10 美元。所以，我们看到一些较大的涨幅和一些较小的涨幅，这取决于品牌、产品类型等等。现实是，即使是能够囤积商品的制造商，也只能囤积那么长时间。没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And guess what? Mattel has had to increase the price on their dolls. Like that actually was preient in a way. You know, American Girl dolls, they had to increase them, I think, by $10 per doll. So, we're seeing some larger jumps and some smaller jumps depending on the brand, the type of product, all of And the reality is that even manufacturers who could stockpile, you can only stockpile for so long. Correct.</p>
</details>

### 受关税影响的特定产品类别

Christine: 你之前提到，你看到儿童和婴儿用品以及钢铁制品的物价上涨了，比如床垫弹簧。还有哪些是钢铁制品的例子？汽车？我们说的是汽车吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned earlier that you've seen prices increase on kids and baby gear on things made with steel. So the mattress coils. What are what are some other examples of steel made goods? Cars. Are we talking cars?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 汽车。螺丝行业。你可能不会想到，螺丝无处不在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cars. the screw industry. Like you don't think about it and screws are in everything and so</p>
</details>

Christine: 包括人类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">including humans.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 我的手腕里就有螺丝。所以这就是挑战的一部分，因为这无法预测，也无法知晓。有些东西可以被吸收，有些则不能。我们现在还看到游戏机，预计它们的价格也会上涨。所以，我们认为如果你打算购买游戏机，你可能现在就想买，因为我们担心它可能会变得更贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have screws in my wrist. So that's part of the challenge of this is that it's impossible to predict. It's impossible to know and so some things can be absorbed and other things can't. We're also seeing right now gaming consoles, we're expecting those to increase. So, that is something that we think really should, you know, if you're going to buy a gaming console, you might want to buy it now cuz we're concerned it might get even more expensive.</p>
</details>

Christine: 那么其他电子产品呢？比如电脑？我们看到这些类别有什么变化吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about other electronics, you know, computers? Are we seeing any sort of movement in in those categories</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 在某些情况下是的。非常有趣的是，负责我们所有 **Chromebook**（Chromebook: 运行 Google Chrome OS 操作系统的笔记本电脑）测试的 Kimber Streams 实际上撤下了我们的首选产品并更换了它，因为价格上涨了 100 美元。据我所知，这并非直接归因于关税，对吧？许多价格上涨也归因于普遍的经济状况、贸易或美元的价值。并非所有公司都直接将问题归咎于关税。但我们确实知道，仅仅因为我们可以在自己的价格追踪中看到，有些东西正在变得更贵。所以，那个 Chromebook 精选产品在所有 Chromebook 中不再感觉是最佳价值，因此他们用一个感觉价值更好的产品取代了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in some cases? So, the really interesting thing is that Kimber streams, who does all of our Chromebook testing, actually removed our top pick and replaced it because it had jumped by $100. That was not as far as I know it was not directly attributed to tariffs, right? A lot of this price increase is also due to general economics or trade or the value of the US dollar. Not every company is attributing things directly to tariffs. But what we do know just because we can see it in our own price tracking is that some things are getting more expensive. So that Chromebook pick in the scheme of all of our Chromebooks no longer felt like the best value and so they replaced it with something that felt like a better value.</p>
</details>

Christine: 那么，考虑到这些类别，那些含有钢铁的物品、螺丝行业、笔记本电脑、耳机，你有什么购物建议吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So thinking about these categories, the things that contain steel, the screw industry, um laptops, headphones, how do you recommend shopping? Yeah,</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 对于电子产品之类的东西，我们的团队真的认为你通常不需要最新的花哨功能。通常改进是渐进的。所以对于大多数人来说，早期版本的产品就足够了。而真正讽刺的是，旧款科技产品应该更便宜，但有时情况并非如此。有时这些科技产品，包括旧版笔记本电脑、耳机之类的，价格反而上涨了。你通常可以购买去年的版本，它会很棒，完全能满足你的需求。我们也推荐一些**翻新商品**（refurbished items: 经过修复、清洁和重新包装，达到接近全新状态的二手商品）。这绝对是一种选择。有很多种购物方式和思考购物框架的方式，无论是圣诞礼物、光明节礼物还是任何节日礼物，我认为这有助于确保你不会恐慌，因为我们绝不希望你恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">with things like electronics, our teams really believe that you generally don't need the absolute latest bells and whistles. Often the improvements are incremental. And so for the majority of people, earlier edition tech is fine. And the thing that's really ironic is that older tech should be less expensive. Sometimes that's not actually the case. Sometimes this tech is getting more expensive. previous versions of laptops, headphones, things like that. You can usually get away with last year's version and it's going to be great. It's gonna totally work for you. We also do recommend some refurbished items, too. That's absolutely a way to go. And there's just a variety of ways that you can shop and frame your thinking about shopping for Christmas gifts or Hanukkah gifts or any general holiday gifts that I think helps ensure that you're not panicking because we never want you to panic.</p>
</details>

Christine: Ann Marie，总结一下我们目前讨论的内容，关税定价今年可能会在不同程度上影响每个产品类别，但你可能会在电子产品和婴儿用品等商品上看到更高的价格。如果你在这个季节寻找好价钱，一定要查看 Wirecutter 的钢铁页面。休息回来后，Ann Marie 将为我们提供一些实用的建议和策略，以帮助我们在节日购物季省钱。请稍等，我们马上回来。

<p class="english-text">Just to recap what we've talked about so far, Amarie, tariff pricing is probably going to impact every product category this year to varying degrees, but you will probably see higher prices on things like electronics and baby gear. And if you're looking for a good price for a deal this season, make sure and check out Wire Cutters Steel page. When we come back, Ann Marie is going to give us some practical advice and some strategies for saving money while shopping this holiday season. Stick around. We'll be right back.</p>

### 零售商策略与价格追踪的重要性

欢迎回来。我们正在与副编辑 Ann Marie Conte 讨论节日购物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome back. We're talking about holiday shopping with deputy editor Anie Conte.</p>
</details>

Christine: Ann Marie，去年黑色星期五前后，我们采访了 Nathan Burrow，他是 Wirecutter 的优惠高级编辑。他提到的一件事我觉得非常有趣，那就是这种——我不知道“阴暗”这个词是否恰当——但这种做法是，在优惠活动之前，产品的价格会上涨，以制造一种假象，让我们觉得当我们说“四折”时，你真的得到了巨大的折扣。请告诉我关于这种情况以及一年后我们看到了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amry, last year around Black Friday, we talked to Nathan Burrow. He's the senior editor of deals here at Wire Cutter. One of the things I thought was really interesting that he mentioned is this kind of um I don't know if shady is the right word but this move where you see prices on products increase just before deals events to sort of give the illusion that when we say 40% off you're getting this massive massive discount. Talk to me about that and what we're seeing a year later.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 我们已经谈论这个问题很多年了。我们一直在观察这种情况在各个零售商那里反复发生。多家零售商都这样做，这并非特定于任何一家零售商。然而，在我们追踪 40 种产品价格的过程中，我们确实看到了这种情况发生，比如一台笔记本电脑在优惠活动前会从 799 美元涨到 899 美元，然后又降回 799 美元。所以看起来它在打折，但实际上价格和之前一直保持不变。现在，**亚马逊**（Amazon: 跨国科技和电子商务巨头）因此面临集体诉讼，声称他们虚报价格以使优惠看起来更好。这就是为什么我们强烈鼓励价格追踪并从可靠的地方购买。这并不是在自吹自擂，但 Wirecutter 的优惠团队就是这样做的，他们不会发布不是真正优惠的价格。

<p class="english-text">We've been talking about this for years. We have been watching this happen over and over and over again across retailers. Multiple retailers do this. It is not specific to any one retailer. However, as we've been doing our 40 product price tracking, we definitely saw this happen where a laptop would go from $7.99 to $8.99 right before the deal event and then it would go back down to $7.99. So, it looked like it was on sale and it was the same price it had been the whole time previous to that. And there's now a class action lawsuit against Amazon for this reason, claiming that they misrepresented their pricing to make the deals look better. That is why we really encourage price tracking and purchasing from a reliable place. Like, not to toot our own deals horn, but that's what they do. and they will not post a price on a deal that isn't a real deal.</p>
</details>

Christine: 没错。所以 Wirecutter 的优惠团队全年都在追踪网站上 Wirecutter 精选产品的价格。他们是如何进行追踪的？它是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So, the deals team at Wire Cutter tracks product prices of Wire Cutter picks across the site all year long. How do they do this tracking? How does it work?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 他们是天才，他们非常擅长这个。所以很多工作是手动的，他们每天都会检查哪些商品在打折，价格是多少，然后他们还会使用每个人都能接触到的工具，对吧？所以有一些工具，比如 **Keepa**（Keepa: 亚马逊价格追踪工具）、**Camelcamelcamel**（Camelcamelcamel: 另一款亚马逊价格追踪工具），甚至 **Google Shopping**（Google Shopping: 谷歌提供的购物比价服务），它们会显示价格随时间的变化。使用 Google Shopping，你需要创建一个列表，它就会开始为你追踪产品。但使用 Keepa 和 Camelcamelcamel，它会显示历史记录。所以你可以查看并了解，它会给你一个大致的时间范围和对产品应有价格的理解，这样你就可以决定是否愿意支付这个价格。需要明确的是，Camelcamelcamel 和 Keepa 是用来追踪亚马逊价格的。如果你想追踪其他网站的优惠历史和价格，可以使用 Google Shopping。

<details>

<p class="english-text">They are geniuses and they're very good at this. Um, so a lot of it is manual. you know, they're checking every day to see what's on sale, to see what the prices are, and then they also use tools that everybody has access to, right? So, there are tools like Keepa, Camel, camel camel, even Google Shopping that will show you the price tracking over time. With Google Shopping, you need to create a list and it'll start tracking the product for you. But with Keepa and Camel, camel camel, it'll show you previous history. So you can take a look and see and it just gives you a general time frame and understanding of how much this product should cost so that you can decide if you're comfortable paying that price. And just to be clear, Camel camel camel and Keepa are to track Amazon prices, prices on Amazon. And then if you're wanting to track, you know, deal history and prices for other sites, use Google shop.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的。好的。那么根据这些数据，你和你的报告是否认为今年节日季的优惠会减少，或者我们看到的优惠会更小，影响力不如往年？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. Okay. So based on that data, do you think and does your reporting suggest that we will see fewer deals heading into the holiday season this year or are the deals that we will see just going to be smaller and less impactful than in years past?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 我们看到今年的优惠质量有所下降。所以，在七月的 **Prime Day**（Prime Day: 亚马逊每年为 Prime 会员举办的大型购物促销活动）和十月的大型优惠日之间，虽然现在这些是亚马逊的专属活动，但许多零售商也会在那段时间推出优惠以试图竞争，对吧？所以，在短短三个月内，我们看到各个零售商的优惠质量变差了。所以你现在得到的优惠比三个月前要差。这有很多原因，其中之一就是囤积的进口商品。但我们也预计，在黑色星期五，会有很多不错的优惠。它们可能不是你见过的最好的优惠，也可能不像往年那样优惠铺天盖地，但我们会继续审查，只发布我们认为值得的优惠。但等到黑色星期五才进行所有购物可能也不是一个好主意，因为它可能不是你见过的最好的优惠。而且我们现在的情况是，黑色星期五在十一月底。所以你只有非常有限的时间来完成节日购物。从文化上讲，我们似乎被训练成认为黑色星期五是等待、思考你想要什么，然后看看能否得到好优惠的时候，对吧？所以，Ann Marie，听起来你说的意思是，今年这种情况可能会有所改变。如果你在黑色星期五之前看到一个好优惠，那就去买吧，因为不能保证你在黑色星期五会看到大幅降价。

<p class="english-text">We've seen deal quality reduce this year. So between July's Prime Day and uh October's big deal days, which now at this point those are Amazon specific events, but many retailers put deals on sale around that time to try to compete, right? So across retailers, we have seen in just those 3 months, the deal quality get worse. So you're getting a worse deal now than you would have 3 months ago. And that's for a variety of reasons. One being the stockpiled imports. But we also expect that for Black Friday, there will be plenty of good deals. They may not be the best deal you've ever seen. It may not be the onslaught of deals that we've seen in years past, but we're going to continue to vet and only post the deals that we deem worth it and worthy. But it's also probably not a good idea to wait until Black Friday to do all of your shopping because it may not be the best deal you've ever seen. And we're also in a position now where Black Friday is the end of November. And so you only have a very limited amount of time to do your holiday shopping. It sounds like culturally we've been sort of trained to think of Black Friday as the time to sort of wait, think about what you want and then see if you can get a good deal, right? So, it sounds like what you're saying, Anry, is that might be changing this year a little bit. If you see a good deal before Black Friday, go ahead and get it because there's no guarantee you're going to see like a huge drop at Black Friday.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的。你认为这准确吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Would you say that's accurate?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 今年等待似乎是个错误。我认为如果你觉得黑色星期五购物很重要，并且想看看有什么优惠，你当然可以而且应该在黑色星期五购物，但我们目前不确定在黑色星期五完成所有购物是否是最明智的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It feels like a mistake to wait this year. I think you should absolutely can and should shop on Black Friday if that's important to you and if you want to see what deals there are out there, but we're not necessarily confident that doing all of your shopping on Black Friday will make the most sense right now.</p>
</details>

Christine: 购物以及围绕购物的经济变化之大令我感到惊讶。我的意思是，即使是黑色星期五、**网络星期一**（Cyber Monday: 感恩节后的第一个星期一，在线购物的促销日），以及随后的任何一个星期二，现在都形成了一整周的购物热潮。你提到了两个 Prime Day。似乎有很多地方可以观察更广泛的经济因素，包括关税，是如何影响商品价格的。这让我觉得如此动态，如此超出我的控制范围，这在节日购物时是一种不舒服的状态。所以我想知道，除了你提到的“也许不要买超出预算的全新笔记本电脑，你可能不需要它”之外，你还有什么实用的建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's amazing to me how much shopping in the economy around shopping has changed. I mean, even the fact of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, whatever Tuesday is, there's this whole week now that's focused. You mentioned both Prime Days. It's just, it seems like there are a lot of places to look at how broader economics and tariffs included are affecting prices of things. And it feels to me to be so dynamic, so out of my control. and that's an uncomfortable place to be when going into holiday shopping. So, I'm wondering what is your practical advice beyond, you know, you mentioned maybe don't buy the brand new laptop if it's out of your price range, you might not need it.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 去年的型号可能很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year's model might be great.</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 这听起来很简单，但实际上就是列一个清单，对吧？我认为其中一部分是，它甚至不必是你所有想买的东西的清单。它应该是你生活中那些你想要确保覆盖到的人，以及他们喜欢什么和对什么感兴趣的大致想法。你仍然可以在这里有一些意外的发现，但只要组织好自己，知道谁对你很重要，谁不应该忘记，这样你就不会在最后一刻感到恐慌。而且，你知道，有很多地方可以买到你可能意想不到的礼物。在高端杂货店或高端药店，有各种各样可爱的小惊喜。如果你看到某件商品有很好的优惠，你认为价格合理，那么多买几件，留作未来的乔迁礼物，或者特别是对于孩子们，作为生日礼物，这并没有坏处，因为我们确实预计物价会变得更贵。所以，储备一些你知道会受到多人欢迎的东西，并不是一个坏主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds so simple and it's literally make a list, right? And I think part of that is it doesn't even have to be a list of everything that you want to buy. It's the people in your life that you want to make sure you cover and a general idea of what they like and they're interested in. You still can have some serendipity here, but just getting yourself organized enough so that you know who's important to you and who not to forget so that you're not panicking at the last minute. And you know, there are so many places where you can buy gifts that you may not expect to. at a high-end grocery store or at a high-end pharmacy, there's all these lovely little delights. And if you see a good deal on something, something that you think is a good price, there's no harm in buying multiples of those and keeping them as future housewarming gifts or especially when it comes to kids, as birthday gifts, because we do expect things to get more expensive. And so having a little stockpile of things that you know will go over well with more than one person is not a bad idea.</p>

### 应对运输延迟及其他建议

Christine: 我喜欢这个建议。你之前提到不要等到黑色星期五。你还说今年的黑色星期五在十一月相当晚。所以运输窗口期有点短，对吧？与往年相比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that. Earlier you mentioned that don't wait for Black Friday. You also said Black Friday is actually quite late in November this year. So the shipping window is kind of short, right? Like comparative to other years.</p>
</details>

Rosie: 人们应该了解哪些关于运输的信息？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What should people know about shipping?</p>
</details>

Ann Marie Conte: 我们亲身经历过。我实际上刚刚从国外订购了一些东西，确实出现了海关延误。它显示已经抵达，但实际上甚至还没有离开仓库。所以，这可能是一个巨大的问题，而且我们没有像我们预期的那样收到那么多送货时的关税账单。那么，你能解释一下那些是什么吗？是的。所以，**微量豁免**（de minimis exemption: 允许低于特定价值的进口商品免除关税和税费的规定）取消了，这意味着任何低于 800 美元的商品都应该免除关税。当这项规定取消后，当你从国外订购商品时，有时法国或英国的公司会承担这些费用，或者他们在结账时会加上这些费用。如果他们不这样做，送货员就会出现在你家门口，说：“除非你支付一些费用，否则我们不会把这个包裹给你。”根据我们所见，通常是 30 美元左右，但 Wirecutter 今年已经订购了数千种产品，我们只收到了少数几张关税账单。所以，我们认为这不像我们想象的那么大的问题。然而，我们确实看到了运输延迟。所以，如果你在像 **Etsy**（Etsy: 一个专注于手工制品、复古商品和独特创意产品的电子商务网站）这样的地方购物，你实际上可以筛选并确保你正在从美国本土的卖家那里购物，这可能会减少商品无法按时到达的摩擦。如果你无法为国外商品预留额外的时间，如果你知道你需要那个法式蛋挞服务器，现在就买吧，以确保它能及时到达，因为那些公司甚至在他们的网站上都说会有运输延迟。请记住这一点。就美国大陆境内的普遍运输而言，大多数零售商都会竭尽全力确保你收到商品。你可能需要多付一点钱，对吧？情况总是如此。随着事情变得越来越紧急，运输费用可能会更高，但他们真的会尽力把它送到你手中。如果你在最后一刻购物，最安全的、不会让你焦虑的方式，确保商品在美国大陆境内送达，大概是十二月的第二周，以确保圣诞节前到达。

<p class="english-text">We've seen firsthand. I actually just ordered something from abroad and there were definitely customs delays. It had said it had already arrived and it hadn't even left its warehouse yet. So, it's potentially a huge issue and we're not seeing as many of the tariff bills upon delivery that we thought we would. So, can you explain what those are? Yes. So, the dimminimous exemption went away, which meant that anything under $800 was supposed to get zero tariffs. When that went away, when you order something from abroad, sometimes, the company in France or in England will absorb those fees or they will add it on at checkout. If they don't do that, the shipper will show up at your door and say, "We're not giving you this package until you pay something." It's usually around $30 from what we've seen, but Wire Cutter has ordered thousands of products this year and we've only received a handful of those tariff bills. So, we don't think it's as big of an issue as we thought it might have been. However, we are seeing the shipping delays. So, if you're shopping at a place like Etsy, you can actually filter down and make sure that you're shopping from US-based sellers and that will reduce the friction potentially of an item not arriving on time. If you can't build in that extra time for something abroad, if you know that you need that French tart server, buy it now just to make sure it gets here because those companies even on their sites are saying there will be shipping delays. Keep that in mind. In terms of shipping generally within the continental US, most retailers are going to work their butts off to make sure that you get it. You might have to pay a little more, right? That's always the case. as things end up more last minute, it might get more expensive to ship, but they're really going to do the best they can to get it to you. And if you are shopping last minute, the safest sort of non nailbiter, make sure it gets within the continental US is like the second week of December for a Christmas arrival.</p>
