### 杰克逊霍尔会议：参会经历与政策意外

主持人：你现在实际参加过多少次**杰克逊霍尔会议**（Jackson Hole Symposium: 每年由堪萨斯城联邦储备银行主办的全球央行年会）了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many Jackson Holes have you actually been to now?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：嗯，有点难说，但我第一次参加是在1997年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, it's a little hard to say, but my first one was 1997.</p>
</details>

主持人：我因为突发新闻不得不去别处，所以错过了几次，但大概有25到30次了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've missed a few here and there as breaking news has happened and I've had to be somewhere else, but so somewhere around 25 to 30.</p>
</details>

主持人：所以乔，如果我们再坚持40年，我们就能像迈克一样参加那么多次杰克逊霍尔会议了。也许...

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Joe, if we keep doing this for another 40 years, we'll uh we'll notch up as many Jackson holes as Mike has been to. Maybe</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：不。但如果他再做40年左右，我们永远也赶不上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">not. But if he does it another 40 or so, we can never catch up.</p>
</details>

主持人：如果迈克现在停下来，我们一直做到80岁，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If Mike stops now and we keep doing it until we're 80,</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：也许我们就能赶上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">maybe we'll catch up.</p>
</details>

主持人：欢迎收听《Lots More》，在这里我们与朋友们一起探讨当下正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome to Lots More, where we catch up with friends about what's going on right now.</p>
</details>

主持人：因为即使《OddLots》结束了，总有更多的事情发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because even when OddLots is over, there's always lots more.</p>
</details>

主持人：我们确实请到了完美的嘉宾。我们当然是在和彭博电视台（Bloomberg TV）独一无二的**Mike McKe**交谈。今天的讲话有点出人意料，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we really do have the perfect guest. We are of course talking to the one and only Mike McKe of Bloomberg TV. A little surprising speech today, huh?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：是的，我错了。大多数分析师也错了，他们认为**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**（Jerome Powell: 现任美联储主席）会希望为9月份的会议保留选择余地，因为我们一直在重复，在下次会议之前还有一份就业报告和一份**消费者物价指数**（CPI: Consumer Price Index: 衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I was wrong. As were the majority of analysts who thought that J. Paul would want to leave his options open for September because as we've been repeating over and over again, there's another jobs report, there's another CPI report before the next meeting.</p>
</details>

主持人：那么，如果我们看到均值回归会发生什么？我们有一份疲软的就业报告。如果下一份报告表现强劲怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what happens if we see a reversion to the mean? We had a weak jobs report. What if the next one comes in strong?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：我们的CPI通胀处于低水平。这会不会大幅上升？如果是这样，你就不想降息了。所以他基本上打开了降息的大门，这有点令人惊讶，因为现在要关上这扇门真的很难。特蕾西，你读过安娜·黄（Anna Wong）的看法了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we had inflation going through CPI at a low level. Does that pick up a lot? In which case you don't want to cut rates. So it was a bit of a surprise that he said basically opened the door to a rate cut because now it's really hard to close that door. Tracy, have you read Anna Wong's take yet?</p>
</details>

主持人：我还没有。她刚在终端上发表了一篇新文章，你应该读一下，但她认为如果以2024年的讲话为基准，那就不算太**鸽派**（dovish: 指货币政策倾向于宽松，支持降息或不加息），这当然是真的。那次讲话更偏鸽派。但我认为我们三人可能都有的感觉是，在很多人突然又开始关注通胀的背景下，这次讲话无疑是鸽派的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have not. So, she has a new piece out on the terminal which you you should read, but she argues that's not so dovish if you use the 2024 speech as the benchmark, which is true for sure. That was a more dovish speech. But what I think the vibe is that maybe the three of us have, it's certainly dovish in the context of a lot of people suddenly like, let's look at the inflation side again.</p>
</details>

主持人：嗯，正是如此。所以迈克，我想你和我们有同样的经历，那就是过去几天你和很多**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行）官员交谈过。他们听起来比几周前更**鹰派**（hawkish: 指货币政策倾向于紧缩，支持加息或不降息）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this is exactly it. So Mike, I think you had the same experience as us, which is a lot of the people from the Fed that you've been talking to over the past couple of days. They sounded more hawkish than they did, you know, perhaps like just three or four weeks ago.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：是的。我必须认为，或者说我必须提醒自己，这可能是一个**选择性偏差**（selection error: 统计学中因样本选择不当导致的误差），因为我们恰好遇到了那些更鹰派的人。显然，主席基本上证实了**克里斯·沃勒**（Chris Waller: 美联储理事）的预测，即他们已经决定通胀将会上升，但会缓慢上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I I have to think that or I have to caution myself to look at this as perhaps, as a statistician would say, a selection error because we happened to hit people who were more hawkish. Obviously, the chairman basically validated Chris Waller's forecast that uh infl they've decided that inflation is going to go up, but it's going to go up slowly.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：通胀需要一段时间才能渗透到经济中，而且会是部门性的、一次性的价格上涨，而不是持续的价格上涨。抛开讲话本身的实际技术经济细节不谈，你是否惊讶于没有更多，我不知道，具有告别意味的内容？毕竟这是他作为主席的最后一次讲话。而且正值我们都在讨论对**美联储独立性**（Federal Reserve independence: 指美联储在制定货币政策时不受政治干预的原则）的威胁之时。你是否惊讶于这只是一次政策性讲话，而没有提及这些更大的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It'll take a while to get into the economy and sector by sector, it'll be a one-time price rise and not a continuing price increase. Setting aside the actual technical economic details of the speech itself, were you surprised that there wasn't something more, I don't know, validary is the word, but you know, it's his last speech as the chairman. It comes at a time when we all were all talking about the sort of threats to Federal Reserve independence. Were you surprised it was such a policy speech and not any sort of nods to some of these bigger things?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：我对此并不惊讶。鲍威尔非常谦逊。他不是那种喜欢自吹自擂的人。我们事先就知道他不想把这次作为主席的最后一次杰克逊霍尔会议搞得声势浩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was not surprised by that. Paul is very self-fulfacing. He's not somebody who likes to toot his own horn. And I we kind of knew going in that he didn't want to make a big deal of this being his last Jackson Hole as chair.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：美联储独立性这件事确实有点令人惊讶，因为它一直是一个大问题。但我认为考虑到他想向市场传递的关于未来政策的信息，再加上他必须讨论新**政策框架**（framework: 央行制定和执行货币政策的指导原则和策略）的整个部分。是的，我认为他们觉得那样会太长、内容太多，而且这些问题会在许多其他场合讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Fed independence thing was a bit of a surprise because it has been such a a big issue. But I think given the message he wanted to send to the markets about the policy going forward, plus he had the whole section on the new framework he had to discuss. Yeah. I think they felt it was just going to be too long, too much and that would come up in many other uh fora to talk about.</p>
</details>

### 美联储新框架的困境与历史背景

主持人：这很有趣，没人谈论这个框架。五年框架研究的成果今天发布了，但它们完全被淹没了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is funny, no one's talking about the framework. The results of like five years of work on the framework are published today and they're just lost in all</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：我曾问过美联储官员这个问题。我说，你们为什么要这样做？因为他们在2020年提出了这个新框架，但它并没有奏效。一年后，鲍威尔说：“好吧，我们已经放弃了这个框架，因为我们遇到了通胀。”所以，如果你要花这么多精力去创建一个框架，然后经济一转向你就放弃它，那意义何在？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have asked uh Fed officials about this. I said, why do you do this? Because they came up with this new framework in 2020 that didn't work. And a year into it, JP Pal said, "Well, we've junk the framework because we've got inflation." And so, if you're gonna go to all this work to create a framework and then as soon as the economy turns, you junk it. Kind of what's the point?</p>
</details>

主持人：他们的论点是，这为他们如何思考问题提供了一个参考点。而今天，他们实际上回到了2012年的立场，那就是...

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And their argument is that it gives them sort of a reference point of how they want to think about things. And today really, they went back to 2012, which was</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：我们会在经济需要的时候做它需要的事情。重要的是要记住，思考2020年的框架很有趣，因为那个框架的存在是如此的2010年代风格，对吧？它就像在思考货币政策的主要问题是长期**低于目标**（undershoots: 指经济指标（如通胀）长期低于央行设定的目标）...

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we'll do whatever the economy needs when it needs it. It's important to remember it's interesting thinking about that 2020 framework because we are so the existence of that framework is so 2010s right it's so like thinking about well the main problem of monetary policy is long periods of undershoots</p>
</details>

主持人：**零利率下限**（zero bound: 指名义利率无法降至零以下的情况）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the zero bound</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：零利率下限，持续低于2%。我们如何才能可靠地将其提高到2%以上？然后五分钟后，我们就遭遇了40年来最严重的通胀。2020年的那个框架确实是那个时代的一个产物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the zero bound constantly under 2% how are we going to credibly get it above and then five minutes later we have the worst inflation yeah in 40 years that was a real that framework from 2020 was is an artifact of a time.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：是的，确实如此。美联储的新框架某种程度上考虑到了这种情况可能再次发生，因为他们不再在就业方面使用“不足”这个词了。而且他们也放弃了对零利率下限的提及，但他们基本上是在说，我们承认我们无法像我们曾经认为的那样精确地引导经济，因为我们所依据的潜在条件变化可能比我们预期的要快。我只想指出，我知道鲍威尔没有直接谈论**中央银行独立性**（central bank independence: 指央行在货币政策上的自主权），但会议上至少有一篇由伯克利大学的**Emmy Nakamura**提交的论文确实涉及了这个问题，我们很快会和她一起制作一期非常好的节目。所以，确实有一些主题讨论，只是我们没有都听到，因为是闭门会议。尽管迈克，你可以进入会议内部。我也可以进去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, absolutely. And the Fed's new framework sort of takes into account the fact that that could happen again because they're not using shortfall anymore in in employment. Uh but and they're they've also dropped references to the zero lower bound, but they basically they're saying we admit that we can't steer the economy in quite as precise a way as we thought we could because the underlying conditions that we're working off of can change faster than we anticipated. I will just note I know that pal didn't speak about central bank independence directly but there is at least one paper being presented at the conference that does deal with this issue by Emmy Nakamura from Berkeley and we have a really good episode coming up with her. So there there is some thematic discussion. It's just we're not all hearing it because it's closed doors. Although Mike, you get to go inside the conference. I get to go inside.</p>
</details>

### 杰克逊霍尔会议的内部氛围与演变

主持人：好的。那么会议室里的气氛是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So what's the vibe like in in the room?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：嗯，我不想让大家失望，但除非你是一位学术经济学家，否则它相当无聊，因为这些论文都是由学术经济学家撰写的，旨在审视长期问题并尝试将其置于背景中，以便中央银行家们能够思考这些问题。好的，这里出现了一个问题。过去的研究对此有什么说法？诸如此类。这不是一个人们进来就说“好的，这是失业率，这是物价，我们下次会议该怎么办？”的会议。这些根本不会被讨论。即使是出席的**联邦公开市场委员会**（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee: 美联储的主要货币政策制定机构）官员，他们也不会真正谈论这些，因为他们一直在谈论这些。他们来这里是为了钓鱼、徒步旅行和欣赏风景，同时阅读这些学术论文。所以，内部是一个学术会议。他们展示论文，有一位评论员讨论论文，然后人们可以提问。如果你注意到，如果你正在看你的彭博终端，几乎从来没有来自内部的头条新闻，因为没有人会说出任何会影响市场或真正引起人们兴趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I hate to disappoint everybody, but it's rather quite boring unless unless you're an academic economist because these papers are written by academic economists and they're designed to look at longer term issues and try to put them into context so that the central bankers can think about them. Okay, here's a problem that's come up. What's the research said about it in the past? That sort of thing. It's not a meeting where people come in and go, "Okay, here's unemployment and here's prices and what do we do at the next meeting?" That that doesn't get discussed at all. Even the open market committee officials who are here, they're not going to be really talking about that because uh they talk about that all the time. They're here to fish and and hike and enjoy the scenery along with these academic papers. So inside it's an academic uh conference. They present the papers. They have a discussant who talks about the papers and then people can ask questions. And if you notice, you know, if you're watching your Bloomberg terminal, it's almost never a headline from inside because nobody says anything that would move markets or interest people really.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：你知道，其他地区的联邦储备银行也有他们的会议。例如，11月波士顿联储会有一个会议。亚特兰大联储也有一个。我想在一年中的某个时候，它会在佛罗里达的某个地方举行。这里唯一真正特别的是，鲍威尔也提到了，它是在八月的杰克逊霍尔。任何人都不会拒绝来这里，他们就是这样请来**保罗·沃尔克**（Paul Volcker: 曾任美联储主席）的，因为他喜欢飞蝇钓。理论上，他们也可以参加其他会议，但这是八月的杰克逊霍尔，而且正如你所提到的，人们来这里是为了飞蝇钓，我认为这实际上是一个重要的因素，即使它只是一个有趣的因素，那就是...

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, other regional feds have their conferences. So, you know, there's there's a Boston Fed one in November. There's an Atlanta Fed one. I think it's somewhere in Florida at some point in the year. The only thing that's really special here is that, and Powell alluded to it, it's Jackson Hole in August. and anyone would be a fool to say no to coming there and that's how they got Vulkar to come because he liked fly fishing like this in theory like they could all show up at the other ones but it's Jackson Hole in August going to say and and and as you mentioned people are here to fly fish I think that's actually an important element even though it's just a fun element which is that</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：这是夏末，对几乎所有人来说，这里有点像度假和工作之间的一个过渡。然而，它变得重要的另一个原因是，从**本·伯南克**（Ben Bernanke: 曾任美联储主席）在大金融危机期间开始，他来到这里，主席通常会就会议主题发表开幕讲话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's late summer it's kind of like halfway between vacation and work out here for almost everyone another reason that it has become important though is starting with Ben Bernani during the great financial crisis he came and the chairman usually gave a speech to open the conference on the conference topic</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：就像是，“好的，我们正在讨论长期劳动力问题。这是一个很好的话题，我们很高兴大家都在这里。”然后他基本上宣布他们将首次在这次会议上实施**量化宽松**（QE: Quantitative Easing: 央行通过购买债券等方式向市场注入流动性以刺激经济的政策）。然后第二年，他还宣布了关于**量化紧缩**（QT: Quantitative Tightening: 央行通过缩减资产负债表来收紧货币政策的行动）以及他们将要做什么。然后突然之间，焦点就变成了主席会说什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it was like, okay, we're talking about long-term labor issues. That's a really good thing to talk about and we're glad you're all here kind of thing. Then he announced basically that they were going to do QE for the first time at this meeting. And then the next year he also had announcement about uh QEQT and what they were going to do. And then all of a sudden the focus became what's the chairman going to say?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：因为八月很少有美联储会议，只是日历上的巧合，也许在月初会有，然后直到九月都没有。所以你有一个漫长的月份，市场没有参考点，而这里就成了参考点。所以每个人都关注它，你知道，它有一个很大的铺垫。哦，下周就是杰克逊霍尔会议了。主席会说什么？所以这确实吸引了大量的关注，然后这种关注又自我强化，因为它变得重要。所以人们都想去那里，因为它很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if there's rarely a Fed meeting in August, just the way the calendar falls, maybe at the very beginning, and then there isn't one till September. So you have this long month where there's no reference point for the markets and that this became the reference point. So everybody pays attention to it and as you know, it's a big buildup to it. Oh, we've got Jackson Hole next week. What's the chairman going to say? And so that's really focused a lot of attention on it, which then feeds on itself because it becomes important. So people want to be there because it is important.</p>
</details>

### 美联储沟通的演变与全球央行面临的挑战

主持人：这让我想起了一项旧研究。那是几年前做的，所以我很想看到一项新研究，但它基本上审视了所有**联邦公开市场委员会**（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee: 美联储的主要货币政策制定机构）的声明和讲话。从2009年开始，它们的长度和复杂性都爆炸式增长。所以我认为以前你可能只需要高中阅读水平就能很好地阅读一些FOMC声明。它们非常短，大约400字。然后它们变成了大约2000字，你至少需要大学学历才能完全理解它们。跟我们谈谈讲话的形式，因为这也是人们喜欢做的事情，就是剖析词语数量之类的。确实，今年的讲话比去年鲍威尔明确打开降息大门的相对简短的讲话要长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This reminds me, there was an old study. It was done a few years ago, so I would love to see a new study, but it basically looked at all the FOMC statements and speeches over time. And starting from 2009, they exploded in both length and complexity. So I think it used to be you could have like, you know, a high school reading level and be fine reading some of the FOMC statements. They were very short, like 400 words. and then they became like 2,000 words and you needed a college degree at a minimum to fully understand them. Talk to us about just like the format of the speech cuz this is something else that people like to do is dissect like the number of words and things like that. And it is true this is a longer speech this year versus the relatively short speech from last year where Pal very definitively opened the door to a cut.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：是的。嗯，我认为这次讲话之所以长，是因为谈到了框架。正如我们所说，这可能有些无关紧要，但他必须讲完。他们一直在进行这项工作，并且预计他会在这里宣布。所以他基本上就是讲完了。我们现在已经完成了这项工作，并且已经向你们解释了，所以如果将来我们提到它，你们就会明白。所以这使得它更长了。真正切中要害的部分是关于经济的内容。他概述了他们对劳动力市场和通胀的看法，以及这两者如何结合。如果这是一次没有框架的普通讲话，它就不会那么长。也许它会显得更有力，因为它只专注于那个主题。你刚才谈到美联储在金融危机后的几年里声明变得非常长，美联储在某个时候也意识到了这一点，所以大约两三年前，他们已经大幅缩减了声明。我们以前有非常长的声明，他们试图解释每一个小细节，人们觉得内容太多了。所以现在他们只是简单地说，我们有一段关于经济现状的段落，以及一段说明我们正在采取什么措施的段落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh well I think that what made this speech long was talking about the framework. It's as we said maybe somewhat irrelevant but he had to go through it. They'd been doing this exercise and it was anticipated he would announce it here. So basically he went through it. We've now done the exercise and now we've explained it to you and so you'll understand going forward if we refer to this. So that made it longer. The part that uh was really kind of to the point was the stuff about the economy. He outlined what they were thinking about uh the labor market and what they were thinking about inflation and then how those two knit together. If this had been an ordinary speech without the framework, it wouldn't have been as long. Maybe it would have come across as even more punchy because it was just on that subject. you you were talking about the Fed's statements getting very long uh in the post great financial crisis years and the Fed realized that at one point and so about two or three years ago they've cut them back significantly. We used to have very long statements where they tried to explain every little thing and people found that too much. So now they're just kind of saying here's we got one paragraph on where the economy is and a paragraph that says here's what we're doing about it.</p>
</details>

主持人：你知道，八月下旬的杰克逊霍尔会议另一个好处是，你不仅能吸引美联储主席，还能吸引世界各地的中央银行家。但我觉得在当下，美联储本身，美联储总是平等的领导者。大多数人都会同意这一点，但美联储因为所有的戏剧性事件，就像一个黑洞一样吸走了所有的能量。你的看法是，我们看到鲍威尔与**克里斯蒂娜·拉加德**（Christine Lagarde: 欧洲央行行长）和**安德鲁·贝利**（Andrew Bailey: 英格兰银行行长）一起散步，你的看法是所有发达市场的中央银行是否仍在大致应对同样的事情？因为通胀等全球因素一直存在。他们是否都基本感受到了同样的压力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know another nice thing about Jackson Hole in late August is you don't just get you don't just lure the Fed share there. you lure central bankers all around the world. But I feel like in this moment the the Fed itself, the Fed is always first among equals. Most people would agree with that, but the Fed because of all the dramas like this black hole sucking up all the energy. It's your perception, you know, we saw the walk where Powell was with Lagarde and Bailey and Ua is your perception that all the developed market central banks are roughly wrestling with still the same things because there's just been there's been this global factor of the inflation and so forth. Are they all sort of basically feeling the same stresses?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：他们是的。我们仍然生活在一个后疫情时代。所以数据有些难以解读，你会看到经济的起伏，你可能能够或无法追踪。但目前最大的问题是，他们都在应对**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump: 前美国总统）的财政政策。但财政政策对不同国家有不同的影响。对美国来说，它是通胀性的。对许多国家来说，它是通缩性的，因为它们的货币正在贬值。美元正在走强。所以他们必须处理不同的问题。他们都面临着特朗普政策后果的问题，但每个国家的后果都不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are. We're still living in a post-pandemic world. So data are somewhat difficult to read and you see the ups and downs of the economies that you may or may not be able to track. But the biggest thing at the moment is that they're all wrestling with Trump fiscal policy. But the fiscal policy has different impacts on different countries. For the United States, it's inflationary. For many of the countries out there, it's deflationary because their currency is going down. The dollar is getting stronger. And so they have different problems they have to deal with. They all have a problem with the consequences of the Trump policy, but but the consequences are different for each one.</p>
</details>

### 关税政策的复杂影响与下一任美联储主席人选

主持人：嗯，你早些时候在电视上谈论过这个问题，因为谈到关税，关于它们实际可能有多大通胀效应，仍然存在巨大的争议，因为在传统经济学中，你会将它们视为一种税收，这往往会破坏需求并可能导致通缩。另一方面，我们已经看到生产者价格开始上涨。你对政策制定者如何看待关税影响了解了多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you were talking about this on TV earlier because when it comes to tariffs, there is still a huge debate over how inflationary they might actually be because in traditional economics, you would view them as a tax which tends to destroy demand and can lead to deflation. On the other hand, we have seen producer prices start to pick up. What have you learned about just how policymakers are actually viewing the impact of tariffs at this conference?</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：嗯，一直存在分歧。我们有**克里斯·沃勒**（Chris Waller: 美联储理事）的版本，他查阅了教科书，说关税是价格水平的一次性上涨，然后自从他七月首次这么说以来，我们看到总统推迟了这些关税。所以，它们一个接一个地生效，这拖长了整个过程。现在，主席似乎决定它仍然会是部门性的一次性上涨。所以，它可能会拖延，但不会是每个部门都看到价格持续上涨的过程。所以，他们很难判断其影响，因为它不像你通过**《斯姆特-霍利关税法案》**（Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: 1930年美国通过的一项大幅提高进口关税的法案，被认为是加剧大萧条的原因之一），并在某个特定日期生效，然后你看到即时的价格影响，然后你可以衡量正在发生什么以及它将做什么。在这里，他们必须考虑每个部门，出口商是否承担了其中任何一部分，进口商是否承担了其中任何一部分，公司在定价方面做了什么。他们是否为了不失去市场份额而从利润中抽取一部分，或者他们只是将成本转嫁给消费者？这些都是复杂的问题，正如一位美联储经济学家对我说的，每个问题都会影响另一个问题。

<p class="english-text">Well, there has been division. We have the Chris Waller version who went to the textbook and said tariffs are a one-time increase in the price level and then since he first said that in July, what we've seen is the president delaying these tariffs. So, they come on one by one and that drags the process out. Now, what the chairman seemed to decide was that it's still going to be a one-time increase sector by sector. So, it might drag out, but it's not going to be an ongoing process of each sector seeing prices rise. So, the impacts they they have a hard time judging because it's not like you pass uh Smoot Holly and on a certain day it takes effect and you see the immediate price impact and then you can measure what's happening and what's it's going to do. Here they have to take into account each sector, whether the the exporter absorbs any of it, whether the importer absorbs any of it, what companies do in terms of pricing. Do they take some out of their margins because they don't want to lose market share or do they just pass it along to people? These are all complex questions and and as one of the Fed economist said to me, each one affects another.</p>

主持人：因为很多这类商品都是用于为其他商品定价的中间产品。所以它变得非常复杂。因此，他们很难确切知道这将如何发展。

<p class="english-text">So because so much of this stuff is intermediate goods that are used to price something else. So it gets very complicated. So, it is hard for them to know exactly how this is going to play out.</p>
</details>

主持人：特蕾西，我有一个看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I have a take.</p>
</details>

主持人：哦。哦，你有吗？真是个惊喜。好吧，说吧。我当时在节目中就在想，也许答案是关税在通胀冲动方面是一次性的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh. Oh, do you? What a surprise. All right, go ahead. I was thinking about this when we were on air is maybe the answer is that tariffs are a one-off</p>
</details>

主持人：但施加关税的潜在政治冲动，这种每个人都希望拥有自己的东西并保护本国产业的愿望，将成为一个新的永久性特征，而不是一次性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in terms of the inflationary impulse but that the underlying political impulse to impose tariffs this desire for everyone to have all their stuff and protect their home uh countries industries and so forth is going to be this new permanent feature that is not a one-off.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：那个特征会是通胀性的吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Would that feature be inflationary?</p>

主持人：如果这种情况持续下去，那么也许会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if that is sustained then maybe it is.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：是的。我的意思是，这里有一个讽刺之处，那就是特朗普政府长期以来一直批评文书工作和政府官僚主义之类的东西，我甚至无法想象现在公司要花多少时间来弄清楚关税问题，以及处理海关文件之类的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean there is an irony here which is uh the Trump administration has long criticized paperwork and government bureaucracy and things like that and I cannot even imagine how much time companies are spending trying to figure out tariffs right now and doing customs documentation and stuff like that.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，迈克，明年我们会有新的美联储主席，杰克逊霍尔会议可能会有新的氛围。你现在在关注谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Mike, next year we're going to have a new Fed chair, new vibes at Jackson Hole potentially. Who are you watching out for</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：我仍然关注最初的特朗普名单，**凯文·哈塞特**（Kevin Hassett）、**凯文·沃什**（Kevin Warsh）和**克里斯·沃勒**（Chris Waller）。你可以争辩说，今天的讲话提高了沃勒的机会，如果你从拉斯维加斯的赔率角度来看，因为他是对的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right now? I'm still watching out for the original Trump list, the Kevin's Hasset and Worsh and for Chris Waller. You could argue that the speech today improved Waller's chances if if you were looking at it from a Las Vegas point of view in terms of odds because he was right,</p>
</details>

主持人：对吗？某种程度上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Sort of.</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：至少美联储是这么说的。但这是**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump: 前美国总统）。所以我们不知道。我认为大多数在讨论阶段被添加到名单上的人更多是**转移视线**（red herrings: 指分散注意力或误导性的信息）。其中一些人显然不会成为主席，但他所能做的就是让更多的人上电视接受采访，问他们“你会成为主席吗？”他们都说：“嗯，我们需要降息。”如果你不打算降息，你就不会在名单上。那么他们真的是认真的候选人吗？**斯科特·贝森特**（Scott Bessent）说：“好的，我要带11个人进来。”总统一直说：“我有三个人要选择。”所以，我认为你还是回到最初的名单。他对这些人感到满意。他们看起来都像是美联储主席的合适人选，而且我们知道这个人给人的印象很重要。所以他们是最有可能被选中。我不是说他不会带来惊喜。他几乎在做的每件事上都会带来惊喜。

<p class="english-text">At least at least the Fed is saying he was right. But this is Donald Trump. So, we have no idea. I think most of the people who've been sort of added on in the talking about stage in terms of the list are more red herrings. Some of them are obviously not going to be the chair, but what he's been able to do is get more people on TV getting interviewed about, are you going to be the chair? And they're all saying, well, we need to cut rates. You're not on the list if you're not going to cut rates. So, are they really serious candidates? And Scott Besson says, "Okay, I got 11 people I'm going to bring in." The president keeps saying, "I got three people I'm going to choose from." So, I think you go back to the original list. He's comfortable with those people. They all look like they could be fed chairs and we know the the impression that the person makes is important. So they're they're the most likely ones to choose from. I'm not saying he couldn't surprise. He surprises in almost everything he does.</p>
</details>

主持人：你以前和沃勒有过互动吗？我从未见过他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you interacted with Waller before? I've never met him. So</p>
</details>

Mike McKe：哦，我非常了解克里斯。关于克里斯有一点是，我们已经将**丽莎·库克**（Lisa Cook: 美联储理事）的事情推断为，如果总统在理事会中有四个人，那么他们就可以解雇所有银行行长等等，他将拥有所有这些控制权。我不认为沃勒会同意这样做。他支持降低利率。他有自己关于经济的看法，但他是一位非常聪明的经济学家，而且你可以为他所说的话辩护，即使你不一定同意。但他是一个**制度主义者**（institutionalist: 强调遵守既定制度和规范的人）。他是一个遵循美联储过去做法的人。我认为他不会屈服于总统做一些会损害美联储、损害其信誉、损害其履行职责能力的事情的愿望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I know Chris quite well. The one thing about Chris is we've we've extrapolated the Lisa Cook thing to if the president got four people on the board, then they can fire all the bank presidents, etc., etc., and he'd have all this control. I don't think Waller would go along with that. He's in favor of lower interest rates. Uh he has his own ideas about the economy, but he's a very smart economist and uh and you could defend what he says even if you don't necessarily agree with it. But he's an institutionalist. He's somebody who follows what the Fed has done in the past. And I don't think he would give in to the president's desire to do something that would hurt the Fed, hurt its credibility, hurt its ability to do its job.</p>
</details>

主持人：特蕾西，现在是2025年。我觉得**大卫·泽沃斯**（David Zervos: 华尔街经济学家）看起来像个美联储主席。
