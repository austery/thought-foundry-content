title: "The University of Chicago's Approach to Academic Writing: Stop Thinking About Rules, Start Thinking About Readers"
summary: "Professor Larry McEnerney explains the University of Chicago's 'top-down' writing philosophy. He argues that serious academic writing is not a basic skill governed by rules, but a high-level tool for thinking. The core challenge for experts is that professional readers are not paid to care about you; therefore, writing must create value by challenging or refining the existing community conversation, rather than just being 'new' or 'clear'."

## The "Top-Down" Approach to Writing

[cite_start]Let me immediately clarify things a bit by telling you a little bit about the difference of the University of Chicago's writing program. [cite: 1, 2, 4] [cite_start]We're one of, as far as we know, two in the country who takes what we call a top- down approach to writing rather than bottom up. [cite: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]

我来给大家澄清一下，介绍一下芝加哥大学写作项目的不同之处。据我们所知，全国只有两个项目采用我们称之为“自上而下”的写作教学法，而不是“自下而上”。

[cite_start]Every other school in the country, their primary constituency is freshmen. [cite: 3, 9] [cite_start]Um so most every school has something like freshman composition, freshman writing, freshman seminars, etc. [cite: 10, 11, 12] [cite_start]We don't actually have that course here. [cite: 12, 13]

国内所有其他学校，他们的主要服务对象都是大一新生。所以几乎每所学校都有类似大一写作、大一研讨会之类的课程。我们这里其实没有那门课。

[cite_start]As I remind people, Chicago is one of the few [universities] in the country that has more faculty than we have freshmen. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] [cite_start]That's because our program teaches throughout the medical school... we teach in the medical school all the time, and they're chockablock with faculty because most of their doctors are also faculty members. [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]

我总提醒别人，芝加哥大学是全国少数几所教员比大一新生还多的大学之一。这是因为我们的项目贯穿了整个医学院……我们一直在医学院授课，而那里到处都是教员，因为他们大多数医生同时也是教员。

## The Real Writing Problem: From Students to Faculty

[cite_start]So when this program got started in the late 70s early 80s our task was not to help the students it was to help the faculty. [cite: 27, 28, 29] [cite_start]This writing program got created because the people on this campus... as the guy who started it used to say, "Our freshman write pretty well. By the time they're third and fourth year students they don't write as well. [cite: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] [cite_start]Our graduate students struggle but the people with the real writing problems are the faculty." [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38] [cite_start]Which just turns on its head the standard notion that writing is a basic skill. [cite: 38, 39, 40]

所以当这个项目在70年代末80年代初启动时，我们的任务不是帮助学生，而是帮助教员。这个写作项目之所以被创立，是因为……就像创办人常说的：“我们的大一新生写得相当不错。但到了大三、大四，他们反而写得没那么好了。我们的研究生在挣扎，但真正有写作问题的人是教员。” 这彻底颠覆了“写作是一项基本技能”的标准观念。

[cite_start]The standard notion in the US and around the world is writing reading writing arithmetic you're supposed to learn it in high school or grammar school, maybe a little bit of college, but if you have to learn it after that there's something wrong with you. [cite: 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46] [cite_start]And therefore there's something remedial about programs like this. [cite: 46, 47, 48, 49]

在美国乃至全世界，标准的观念是读、写、算是你应该在高中或文法学校就学会的，也许大学会再学一点，但如果你在那之后还得学，那你就有问题了。因此，像这样的项目总被认为是“补习性质的”。

[cite_start]I've been talking to people for 30 years who their main reaction to any program I teach is that they do not want to be there and they think there's something a little bit offensive. [cite: 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] [cite_start]...you get a whole bunch of Oxford and Cambridge educated professionals or academics in a room and say, "We've brought in this guy to help you with your writing, and by the way, he's from Chicago." [cite: 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61] [cite_start]You know, waves of hostility coming at me across the room. [cite: 62, 63]

30年来，我遇到的人们对我教的任何项目的主要反应是，他们不想待在那里，并且觉得这有点冒犯。……你把一群牛津、剑桥毕业的专业人士或学者叫到一个房间，然后说：“我们请了这家伙来帮你们提高写作，顺便说一句，他来自芝加哥。” 你能感觉到敌意像浪潮一样从房间对面涌来。

## This Is Not a Remedial Course

[cite_start]So, I need you to know that this is not a remedial writing course. [cite: 64, 65] [cite_start]This is not a course in anything that you should have learned earlier on and didn't. [cite: 15, 16]

所以，我需要你们知道，这不是一个补习写作课。这门课教的不是你本该早就学会却没学会的东西。

It is overwhelmingly not a course in rules. [cite_start]I am not going to give you rules for writing. [cite: 16, 17] [cite_start]In fact, I'm going to spend a lot of a time attacking the fact that your training has been rulegoverned training. [cite: 17, 18] [cite_start]We think that is very bad for people who are operating at the level that you're operating. [cite: 18, 19]

这门课绝对不是关于规则的。我不会给你们写作规则。事实上，我将花大量时间来抨击你们所受的“基于规则的训练”。我们认为这对于像你们这样高层次运作的人来说非常糟糕。

[cite_start]Rule-governed training is very useful for people who are, forgive me for saying this, who are turning out a lot of writing, each of which is of relatively low value. [cite: 19, 20] [cite_start]So, if you're working at a business where you have to write a short memo every day or two to convey some information to somebody, it's fine to have a rule.[cite: 20, 21]...But that is not what you're doing. [cite_start]That is not the level of value your work has to generate. [cite: 21, 22, 23]

基于规则的训练对于那些，请原谅我这么说，需要大量产出相对低价值写作的人非常有用。所以，如果你在一家公司工作，每天都得写一两份短备忘录来传达信息，那么有规则是没问题的。……但那不是你们在做的事。你们的工作需要产出的也不是那种层次的价值。

[cite_start]And so, you one of the things that I'm going to be saying to you is you need to stop thinking about rules and start thinking about readers. [cite: 23, 24]

因此，我要告诉你们的事情之一是，你们需要停止思考规则，开始思考读者。

## The Expert Writer's Dilemma: Writing to Think

Here's the problem that experts have. [cite_start]You are in our vocabulary, you are what we call **expert writers**. [cite: 24, 25] [cite_start]What this means is not that you are necessarily expert at writing... [cite: 25, 26] [cite_start]But what it means is that you are writing about a subject at which you have expert knowledge. [cite: 26, 27]

这就是专家们遇到的问题。在我们的词汇中，你们被称为 **“专家作者”**（Expert Writers: 指那些在特定领域拥有专业知识并就此进行写作的人，而非指写作技巧本身）。这并不一定意味着你是写作专家……而是意味着你正在写的领域，你拥有专家级的知识。

[cite_start]You are not like high school students who are using their writing to introduce themselves to something at a fairly basic level. [cite: 27, 28] [cite_start]You are operating at the most sophisticated levels. [cite: 28, 29] [cite_start]When I work with faculty... I am working with people who are after all on the frontiers of knowledge. [cite: 29, 30] They're thinking stuff nobody's thought before. [cite_start]This is very hard stuff. [cite: 30, 31]

你们不像高中生那样，用写作来介绍一些非常基础的东西。你们在最高深的层次上运作。当我和教员们一起工作时……我是在和那些站在知识前沿的人打交道。他们在思考前人未曾想过的东西。这是非常困难的。

[cite_start]You are thinking about your world in very difficult ways. [cite: 32] [cite_start]This is a terrifically good thing and it's the source of most of the value of your work. [cite: 32, 33] [cite_start]Now you are also writing about that world and this is where a problem starts arising. [cite: 33, 34]

你们在以非常困难的方式思考你们的世界。这是一件极好的事情，也是你们工作价值的主要来源。现在，你们也在写作描绘那个世界，问题就出在这里了。

[cite_start]Unlike a journalist, almost surely you are using your writing process to help yourself think. [cite: 34, 35] [cite_start]In other words, the thinking that you're doing is at such a level of complexity that you have to use writing to help yourself do your thinking. [cite: 35, 36]

和记者不同，你们几乎肯定在利用写作过程来帮助自己思考。换句话说，你们正在进行的思考其复杂程度如此之高，以至于你们必须用写作来帮助自己完成思考。

This is quite different from high school students. [cite_start]My high school teachers told me, "Larry, there are two different processes. [cite: 36, 37] [cite_start]First, there's a thinking process, then there's a writing process." [cite: 37, 38] [cite_start]I had a teacher who said to me, "You are not ready to write your first word until you are finished thinking."[cite: 38, 39]...This was not a problem for me. [cite_start]First, I wrote the paper, then I wrote the outline. [cite: 40, 41]

这和高中生完全不同。我的高中老师告诉我：“拉里，这是两个不同的过程。首先是思考过程，然后是写作过程。” 我有位老师对我说：“在思考结束之前，你一个字都不能写。” ……这对我来说不是问题。我总是先写完论文，再倒回去写大纲。

[cite_start]But I thought I was the only one. [cite: 41, 42] [cite_start]...Nobody works that way. [cite: 43, 44] [cite_start]...But you are using your writing to help yourself think. [cite: 45, 46, 47, 48] [cite_start]If you don't do this for most people, you cannot think at the level you need to think. [cite: 48, 49]

但我以为只有我一个人这样。……根本没人是那样工作的。你们在用写作帮助自己思考。对大多数人来说，如果不这样做，你们就无法达到你们需要思考的深度。

## The Clash: Thinking Patterns vs. Reading Patterns

[cite_start]This means you have a very different set of writing challenges than anybody else has. [cite: 51, 52] [cite_start]This is a course about those challenges. [cite: 52, 53] [cite_start]...Here's the challenge. [cite: 53] [cite_start]You generate the text while you are doing your thinking. [cite: 54, 55, 56] [cite_start]But then you're going to send this text out to readers [cite: 56, 57, 58] [cite_start]and the readers are going to look through that text and if you've done your job, they're going to change the way they see the world. [cite: 58, 59, 60]

这意味着你们面临的写作挑战与其他人截然不同。这门课就是关于这些挑战的。……挑战在于：你们在思考的同时产出了文本。但接着你们要把文本发送给读者，读者会阅读这些文本，如果你们做好了，他们看待世界的方式将会改变。

So here's the problem symbolically. [cite_start]You actually generate a text on the horizontal axis, but whether it does its job depends on the vertical axis. [cite: 60, 61] And here's the problem. [cite_start]Very predictably, experts use language in one set of patterns to do their thinking, but those very same experts read with a different pattern. [cite: 61, 62]

所以这里有个象征性的问题。你们在“横轴”上产出文本，但它能否完成任务却取决于“纵轴”。问题就在于此：非常可预测地，专家们在思考时使用一套语言模式，但这些专家在阅读时却使用另一套模式。

So here's what happens. [cite_start]You have used your text as you must use it to help yourself think, but you're going to use writing patterns and language patterns that interfere with the way your readers read... even when those readers are also other experts. [cite: 63, 64, 65]

于是，问题发生了。你必须用文本来帮助自己思考，但你使用的写作模式和语言模式会干扰读者的阅读方式……即使那些读者也是其他专家。

What happens to readers when you do that? [cite_start]...The last thing they're going to do is they're just going to stop. [cite: 66, 67, 68] [cite_start]What happens before then? [cite: 68, 69]

当你这样做时，读者会怎么样？……他们最后会做的就是停止阅读。但在此之前呢？

1.  [cite_start]**They slow down.** [cite: 79] [cite_start]The first thing that happens is you slow down. [cite: 78, 79] [cite_start]You either read more slowly the first time or you have to read and reread and reread. [cite: 80, 81]
2.  [cite_start]**They don't understand.** [cite: 68, 69] [cite_start]The second thing that happens is... they do not understand. [cite: 69, 82]
3.  [cite_start]**They get aggravated.** [cite: 83]
4.  [cite_start]**Then you're done.** [cite: 83]

1.  **他们慢下来。** 首先发生的是你阅读速度减慢了。你要么第一次读就读得很慢，要么你必须一遍又一遍地重读。
2.  **他们不理解。** 第二件事是……他们无法理解。
3.  **他们被激怒了。**
4.  **然后你就完蛋了。**

## The Shift: Readers "Paid to Care About You"

[cite_start]Now, when this happens to you and you reread and reread, why did you do that? [cite: 84] [cite_start]Why didn't you just stop? [cite: 85]
[cite_start]“Because I need to read the content or understand the content of this paper.” [cite: 85, 86]
That's exactly right. [cite_start]What do you suppose happens if they don't need to read it? [cite: 86]
[cite_start]“They don't.” [cite: 87]

那么，当你遇到这种情况（需要反复重读）时，你为什么这么做？为什么不直接放弃？
“因为我需要阅读或理解这篇论文的内容。”
完全正确。那么，如果他们不需要读呢？
“他们就不读了。”

[cite_start]The problem is, you have no idea how to handle that problem.[cite: 87, 88]...How many things have you written in your life? [cite_start]...Academicy stuff. [cite: 88, 89, 90] Let's make it up. 100. [cite_start]You've written a 100 academic texts in your life. [cite: 90, 91, 92] [cite_start]Did the reader stop reading them? [cite: 92, 93]
[cite_start]“Never.” [cite: 93]
[cite_start]No. Why not? [cite: 94]
[cite_start]“They were grading it.” [cite: 94]

问题是，你们不知道如何处理这个问题。……你这辈子写了多少东西？……学术性的东西。我们假设一下，100篇。你写过100篇学术文章。你的读者停止阅读了吗？
“从没有过。”
是的。为什么不呢？
“因为他们要给我打分。”

Let's be a little more crude about it. [cite_start]They were paid. [cite: 94, 95] [cite_start]Your teachers read your stuff because they were paid to. [cite: 95, 96, 57] [cite_start]Why were your teachers reading your text? [cite: 58, 59] [cite_start]To change the way they see the world? [cite: 60, 61] [cite_start]No. Why? [cite: 61, 62, 63]

我们说得更直白一点。他们拿了薪水。你的老师读你的东西，是因为他们拿了钱才这么做的。你的老师为什么要读你的文章？为了改变他们看待世界的方式吗？不是。那是为什么？

[cite_start]Teachers read texts because they are paid to care about the students. [cite: 97] [cite_start]You've learned to write in a system where you're writing to readers who are paid to care about you. [cite: 97, 98] [cite_start]That will stop. [cite: 98, 99]

老师读学生的文章，是因为他们拿钱去关心学生。你们学会写作的那个系统，是“你写给那些拿钱来关心你的人”的系统。这种情况即将停止。

[cite_start]The rules that you've learned about writing were rules that were generated in the system where you are writing to somebody who's paid to care about you. [cite: 100] [cite_start]That's over in the world beyond school. [cite: 100, 101, 102] [cite_start]They're not paid to care about you. [cite: 102, 103]

你们学到的写作规则，是在那个“你写给拿钱来关心你的人”的系统中产生的。在学校以外的世界，这套行不通了。他们可没拿钱来关心你。

## The Only Thing That Matters: Value

[cite_start]Why are they reading your stuff? [cite: 103, 104] [cite_start]...The journals, your colleagues. [cite: 104, 105]
[cite_start]“Because they think it's valuable to them.” [cite: 105]

他们为什么要读你的东西？……期刊、你的同事。
“因为他们认为这对他们有价值。”

[cite_start]How much of student work is valuable to the faculty to which the students are writing? [cite: 106] [cite_start]...And by the way, some faculty who said to you, "Oh, your work was so valuable. Thank you." [cite: 106, 107] [cite_start]They were lying. [cite: 107, 108] [cite_start]...It was valuable to them because they learned that people misunderstood things in ways they had no idea people could misunderstand. [cite: 108, 109]

学生写给老师的东西里，有多少对老师来说是“有价值”的？……顺便说，有些老师跟你说：“哦，你的作业很有价值。谢谢你。” 他们在撒谎。……它之所以有价值，是因为老师们借此了解到，原来学生们能以他们（老师）完全想象不到的方式去误解事物。

[cite_start]Look, here's the problem you've got. [cite: 112] Yeah. Your writing needs to be clear. Sure. [cite_start]Your writing needs to be organized. [cite: 112, 113, 114] [cite_start]Yes, your writing needs to be persuasive. [cite: 114, 115] [cite_start]...But more than anything else, from now on, your writing needs to be **valuable**. [cite: 115, 116]

看，这就是你们面临的问题。是的，你的写作需要清晰。当然。你的写作需要有条理。是的，你的写作需要有说服力。……但从现在开始，最重要的是，你的写作需要**有价值**。

[cite_start]Because if it's not that, nothing else matters. [cite: 116] [cite_start]It makes zero difference. [cite: 116, 117] [cite_start]...Overwhelmingly, [the problem] is because it's not valuable. [cite: 121, 122, 123, 124, 125] [cite_start]And the other stuff doesn't matter. [cite: 125, 126] [cite_start]If it's clear and useless, it's useless. [cite: 126] [cite_start]If it's organized and useless, it's useless. [cite: 126, 127] [cite_start]It's persuasive and useless, it's useless. [cite: 127]

因为如果做不到这一点，其他一切都无关紧要。没有任何区别。……绝大多数情况下，[发表不了的]问题在于它没有价值。其他的东西都不重要。如果它清晰但无用，那它就是无用的。如果有条理但无用，那它就是无用的。如果有说服力但无用，那它就是无用的。

## Where Value Comes From: The Reader Community

[cite_start]Now, this terrifies people because they make the mistake. [cite: 128] [cite_start]...They think, "Oh my god, what if my ideas just aren't valuable?" [cite: 129, 130] [cite_start]...There's no such thing as value here [in the content itself]. [cite: 130, 131] [cite_start]Value's here [in the reader]. [cite: 131]

这吓坏了人们，因为他们犯了个错误。……他们想：“哦天啊，万一我的想法就是没有价值怎么办？” ……价值并不存在于[内容本身]中。价值存在于[读者]那里。

[cite_start]The question is whether this particular community of readers values it, which is why it's so much about readers and not about content. [cite: 131, 132] [cite_start]Can you imagine writing a text which one group of readers thinks is terrifically useful and another group of readers thinks is useless? [cite: 132, 133] [cite_start]Well, yeah. [cite: 133]

问题在于这个特定的读者群体是否认为它有价值，这就是为什么写作是关于读者，而不是关于内容。你能想象写一段文字，一群读者觉得它非常有用，而另一群读者觉得它毫无价值吗？完全可以。

[cite_start]...I say, "Okay, what journals are you going to submit it to?" [cite: 134, 135] [cite_start]and they look at me and say,"What does that matter?" [cite: 135, 136] Because they think it needs to be clear. [cite_start]It needs to be organized. [cite: 136, 137] It needs to be persuasive. [cite_start]...That's crazy wrong. [cite: 137, 138] But most importantly is valuable. [cite_start]Value lies in readers, right? [cite: 138, 139] [cite_start]Not in the thing. [cite: 139]

……我说：“好吧，你打算投稿给哪些期刊？”他们看着我说：“那有什么关系？”因为他们认为文章只需要清晰、有条理、有说服力。……这大错特错。最重要的是价值。价值在于读者，对吧？而不在于事物本身。

[cite_start]And so how people can think about their writing without thinking about readers is probably the biggest challenge you face. [cite: 139, 140] [cite_start]You've been trained to think about writing formally rule governed. [cite: 140, 141] [cite_start]You have to stop and you have to think about readers, not generic readers. [cite: 141, 142]

所以，人们怎么能只考虑写作而不考虑读者，这可能是你们面临的最大挑战。你们被训练成以形式化的、基于规则的方式思考写作。你们必须停止，必须开始思考读者，而不是泛泛的读者。

## Writing Is Not "Conveying Ideas," It's "Changing Ideas"

Here's a shock. [cite_start]You think writing is conveying your ideas. [cite: 183, 184] [cite_start]It's not. [cite: 184] [cite_start]...You think that writing is communicating your ideas to your readers. [cite: 184, 185] [cite_start]It is not. [cite: 185]

告诉你们一个惊人的事实。你们认为写作是在传达你们的想法。并不是。……你们认为写作是把你的想法传达给读者。不是的。

What is professional writing? [cite_start]...It's changing their ideas. [cite: 186, 187] [cite_start]Nobody cares what ideas you have. [cite: 187]

什么是专业写作？……是改变他们的想法。没人在乎你有什么想法。

[cite_start]This is way more radical than it sounds.[cite: 188]...I teach argument a lot and I [used to] say to students who make an argument "why do you think that?" [cite_start]...and then I realize this is a horrible question it's a teacherly question. [cite: 188, 189] [cite_start]A teacher says why do you think that because the teacher wants to know what's in [your] head. [cite: 189] [cite_start]...So now I don't say to him why do you think that I say now why should I think that? [cite: 189, 190]

这远比听起来要激进。……我经常教辩论，我[过去]常常问提出论点的学生“你为什么这么想？”……后来我意识到这是一个很糟糕的问题，这是一个老师才会问的问题。老师问“你为什么这么想”，因为老师想知道你脑子里在想什么。……所以现在我不再问“你为什么这么想”，我问：“我为什么应该这么想？”

And guess what? "Because I think that." [cite_start]That doesn't work. [cite: 190] [cite_start]...Why doesn't it work in academia? [cite: 190, 191] [cite_start]...Because there's a rule of Western academia. [cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 198] [cite_start]...The rule says nothing will be accepted as knowledge or understanding until it has been challenged by someone competent to challenge it. [cite: 198, 199, 200]

你猜怎么着？“因为我就是这么想的。” 这是行不通的。……为什么这在学术界行不通？……因为西方学术界有一条规则。这条规则是：任何事物在被有能力挑战它的人挑战之前，都不能被接受为知识或理解。

[cite_start]This is very important because it changes your readers. [cite: 200, 201] [cite_start]...Teachers read because they're paid to care about writers. [cite: 202] [cite_start]...Your readers [in academia] have the professional function of challenging what you say. [cite: 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221]

这非常重要，因为它改变了你的读者。……老师阅读是因为他们拿钱去关心作者。……而你们（在学术界的）读者，他们的职业职能就是挑战你所说的话。

## Stop Explaining, Start Arguing

[cite_start]It is an enormous mistake of PhD level writers that they try to explain first. [cite: 206, 207] [cite_start]And I know why you try to explain first. [cite: 207, 208] [cite_start]Because in school they just wanted you to explain first because the whole thing was just about seeing what you know. [cite: 208, 209]

博士生作者犯的一个巨大错误就是他们总想先“解释”。我知道你们为什么想先解释。因为在学校，他们只希望你先解释，因为整件事就是为了看你懂不懂。

[cite_start]...Don't begin with definition guys. [cite: 210, 211, 212]

……各位，不要用定义开头。

[cite_start]...When I sit with somebody... who's worried about their career not going anywhere, it can't be about their individual voice. [cite: 368, 369, 370] [cite_start]It's about what's going to make it valuable to their readers. [cite: 370, 371]

当我和一个……担心自己事业停滞不前的人坐在一起时，重点不能是他们的“个人声音”。重点是“什么能让他们的读者觉得有价值”。

...Do not explain. [cite_start]Argue. [cite: 344] You're talking to people who like wrote this stuff. [cite_start]You don't have to explain it to them. [cite: 344, 345] [cite_start]You have to predict what they're going to doubt when you say they're wrong. [cite: 345, 346] [cite_start]So you say to them, "You're wrong about this." [cite: 346, 347] And they say, "Why should I agree that I'm wrong?" [cite_start]And you say, "Well, here's why." [cite: 347, 348]

……不要解释。去论证。你在和那些写了这些东西的人对话。你不需要向他们“解释”。你必须预测当你（或明或暗地）说他们错了时，他们会质疑什么。所以你对他们说：“你们在这点上搞错了。”他们说：“我为什么要同意我错了？” 你说：“好，原因如下。”

That's what introductions do. [cite_start]They give a quick version of why these people should think that they're wrong and they say, "Well, okay... Now, I'll start reading the rest of it." [cite: 348, 349] Why? [cite_start]Because you've caused them to think that your work might be valuable for them. [cite: 349, 350]

这就是引言（Introduction）的作用。引言给出了一个简洁的版本，告诉这些人为什么他们应该（考虑）他们错了，然后他们会说：“好吧……我接着读下去。” 为什么？因为你已经让他们认为，你的工作对他们来说可能是有价值的。

## Forget "New" and "Original," Focus on "Valuable"

[cite_start]Take the word new or worse, original. [cite: 214, 215] [cite_start]If you think that you're here to do new and original work... kill [those words]. [cite: 215, 216] [cite_start]...You are not here to do original work. [cite: 217, 218] [cite_start]You are here to do valuable work. [cite: 218, 219]

忘掉“新”（new）这个词，或者更糟的，“原创”（original）。如果你认为你来这是为了做“新”和“原创”的工作……请忘掉这些词。……你来这里不是为了做原创工作。你是来做有价值的工作的。

[cite_start]What's the difference? [cite: 219] [cite_start]You think you're here to create new knowledge? [cite: 219, 220] [cite_start]...We can create new knowledge in the next 30 seconds. [cite: 221, 222] [cite_start]All we have to do is count up the number of people who are in this room because nobody in the world knows how many people are in this room. [cite: 222, 223] [cite_start]...Is anybody going to read that paper? [cite: 224, 225, 226] [cite_start]Why not? [cite: 226] [cite_start]They're going to say, "Who cares...?" [cite: 226, 227]

区别是什么？你以为你是来创造新知识的？……我们可以在接下来的30秒内创造新知识。我们只需要数一下这个房间里有多少人，因为全世界没人知道这个房间里有多少人。……有人会读那篇论文吗？为什么不？他们会说：“谁在乎啊？”

[cite_start]...[My friend's dissertation] was new and it's original, but it is not knowledge.[cite: 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239]...She was living in a positivistic world where knowledge looks like this [buildup model]. [cite_start]...And that is dead. [cite: 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260]

……[我朋友的论文]是新的，也是原创的，但它不是知识。……她活在一个实证主义的世界里，知识看起来是[累加]的。……那种模式已经死了。

Here's the model. Now, these are human beings. [cite_start]There are conversations moving through time and there's a bunch of people and they get to say what knowledge is. [cite: 240, 241] [cite_start]...That's the way it works. [cite: 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250] [cite_start]...In order for us to [get better], you have to be dealing with the stuff we say is knowledge. [cite: 261, 262, 263, 264]

现在的模式是这样的。这些是人。对话在时间中推进，有一群人，他们决定了什么是知识。……世界就是这样运作的。……为了让我们[变得更好]，你必须处理我们称之为知识的东西。

## Case Study: Signaling Value (1A vs 1B)

Okay, turn to the first page. [cite_start]...We're going to read two imagined contenders for a grant or publication, and we're going to decide which of these two we're going to publish. [cite: 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]

好的，翻到第一页。……我们将阅读两篇虚构的、竞争拨款或出版的文章，然后我们来决定要发表哪一篇。

**1. [cite_start]A.** As a consequence of the cost of sex, the theoretical probability of clonal and sexual coexistence is low. [cite: 154] [cite_start]Observation of coexistence in vertebrae taxa has been reported within the frozen niche variation model. [cite: 156] [cite_start]The relevant parameter is difference in overall niche breadth. [cite: 157] [cite_start]A wider niche breath for the sexuals and for the clones is predicted in performances in monocultures. [cite: 158] [cite_start]Performances and mixtures do not indicate such a relationship. [cite: 159] [cite_start]Switching of behaviors or resource use patterns between mixed and pure cultures may be the cause. [cite: 160] [cite_start]Post study will examine the predictions of the FNB model. [cite: 161]

**1. A.** 由于有性生殖的代价，克隆与有性共存的理论概率很低。在“**冻结生态位变异模型**”（Frozen Niche Variation Model: 一种解释有性生殖和无性生殖种群如何共存的生物学理论）中，已有报道观察到脊椎动物类群中的共存现象。相关参数是总生态位广度的差异。在单一培养模式下，有性生殖的生态位广度预计比克隆的更宽。但在混合培养模式下的表现并未显示出这种关系。混合与纯培养模式之间行为或资源使用模式的转换可能是原因所在。后续研究将检验 FNB 模型的预测。

[cite_start]**1B.** As a consequence of the cost of sex, the theoretical probability of clonal and sexual coexistence is low. [cite: 163] [cite_start]**Nonetheless**, observation of coexistence in vertebrae taxa has been **widely reported**. [cite: 163, 164] [cite_start]Within the **accepted model** of frozen niche variation, coexistence is explained by difference in overall niche breadth. [cite: 164, 165] [cite_start]**However**, **although** the FNV model correctly predicts wider niche breadth for the sexuals and for the clones, its predictions are **inconsistent** with reported performances in mixtures. [cite: 165, 166] [cite_start]The proposed study will examine whether the **anomaly** may be explained by the switching of behaviors or research use patterns between mixed and pure cultures. [cite: 166, 167]

**1B.** 由于有性生殖的代价，克隆与有性共存的理论概率很低。**然而（Nonetheless）**，在脊椎动物类群中，共存现象已有**广泛报道**。在**公认的（accepted）**冻结生态位变异模型中，共存是通过总生态位广度的差异来解释的。**但是（However）**，**尽管（although）** FNV 模型正确预测了有性生殖的生态位广度比克隆更宽，但其预测与已报道的混合培养模式下的表现并**不一致（inconsistent）**。本研究将探讨这种**异常（anomaly）**是否可以通过混合与纯培养模式之间行为或资源使用模式的转换来解释。

Which of these were going to be more likely to fund? [cite_start]Second one, of course, why? [cite: 167, 168]
...Tell me the words on the page. [cite_start]...What's the first word you see that makes it valuable? [cite: 270, 271, 272, 273]
[cite_start]“Nonetheless.” [cite: 274]
Next.
[cite_start]“...Widely accepted.” [cite: 275]
Next.
[cite_start]“However.” [cite: 275]
“Although.”
Next.
[cite_start]“Inconsistent.” [cite: 276]
Next.
[cite_start]“Anomaly.” [cite: 277]

我们更可能资助哪一个？当然是第二个，为什么？……告诉我页面上的词。……你看到的第一个使其具有价值的词是什么？
“然而（Nonetheless）。”
下一个。
“……广泛接受的（Widely accepted）。”
下一个。
“但是（However）。”
“尽管（Although）。”
下一个。
“不一致（Inconsistent）。”
下一个。
“异常（Anomaly）。”

## Learning the "Code" of Your Community

[cite_start]Here's my first piece of advice... Spend 15 minutes a week for the rest of this year taking articles in your field. [cite: 278, 279] [cite_start]...Go through and circle every word in the writing that is creating value to the readers. [cite: 280, 281]

这是我给你们的第一条建议……在今年剩下的时间里，每周花15分钟，找出你领域的文章。……通读并圈出写作中所有为读者创造价值的词。

[cite_start]Every community has its own codes. [cite: 287] [cite_start]The communities you're entering have their own codes. [cite: 287, 288] [cite_start]A set of words that communicates value. [cite: 288] [cite_start]You must know the codes of the communities you're working in. [cite: 288, 289]

每个社群都有自己的“代码”（codes）。你们即将进入的社群也有他们自己的代码。这是一套传达价值的词汇。你必须了解你所在社群的代码。

Tell me the words you underline that has to do with the community of readers. [cite_start]...Which words have to do with the community? [cite: 306, 307]
“Widely”
“Accepted.”
[cite_start]“Reported.” [cite: 308]
[cite_start]Those are words that cued that there was a community of people who want to understand this. [cite: 308, 309]

告诉我你划线的词中，哪些是与读者社群有关的？……哪些词与社群有关？
“广泛地（Widely）”
“公认的（Accepted）。”
“已报道的（Reported）。”
这些词都在暗示，存在一个想要理解这个问题的社群。

What do the other words do? [cite_start]Nonetheless, however, although, what do they do? [cite: 310, 311] [cite_start]...What's the difference between 'and' and 'but' in creating value? [cite: 319, 320] [cite_start]...That's it. [cite: 320, 321]

其他词是做什么的？Nonetheless, however, although，它们做什么？……“和”（and）与“但是”（but）在创造价值上有什么区别？……就是这个。

Imagine if you go to your readers and say, "Hey community, I've read your stuff. I've thought about what you think and I have something to say." [cite_start][Or] "Hey readers, I've read your stuff. I know what you think, **but** you're wrong." [cite: 321] [cite_start]Which one are they going to pay attention to? [cite: 321]

想象一下，你去找你的读者说：“嘿，社群，我读了你们的东西。我想了你们的想法，我有些话要说。” 或者：“嘿，读者们，我读了你们的东西。我知道你们在想什么，**但是**你们错了。”他们会注意哪一个？

[cite_start]...I am telling you that every article published in that journal in the last 20 years has opened by saying readers are wrong. [cite: 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328]

……我告诉你们，在过去20年里，那本期刊上发表的每一篇文章，都是以“读者们错了”开头的。

[cite_start]...You have to know the code. [cite: 331] [cite_start]If you say to the people who are the dominant figures in your field, "You know what? I've read all your stuff and you're idiots." [cite: 331, 332] [cite_start]Not going to go well. [cite: 332, 333] [cite_start]...What do you suppose the code is? [cite: 334, 335, 336, 337, 338] [cite_start]...Yeah, but the code is "Wow. Are you smart? ...You've advanced this community through in fabulous ways, **but** there's this little thing you got here that's wrong." [cite: 338, 339, 340, 341]

……你必须懂行话（code）。如果你对你领域的权威人物说：“你知道吗？我读了你所有的东西，你就是个白痴。” 这不会有好下场。……你觉得行话应该是什么？……对，行话是：“哇。你真聪明。……你以非凡的方式推动了社群的进步，**但是**，你在这里有个小地方搞错了。”

[cite_start]And now they say, "Oh, well, thank you for appreciating it. But what do you think we have wrong?" [cite: 341, 342, 343]

现在他们会说：“哦，谢谢你的欣赏。那我们哪里搞错了？”

[cite_start]...If you say that they've done something wrong, I'm taking a huge risk." [cite: 352] True. [cite_start]You think you're not taking a risk if you do this. [cite: 352, 353] What's the risk you run if you do this? [cite_start]"Hey, really smart people... I have something I want to add." [cite: 353, 354, 355] [cite_start]...What's the risk you run there...? [cite: 355, 356, 357]
[cite_start]“We don't care.” [cite: 358, 359, 360]

……[你会想]“如果我说他们做错了什么，我是在冒巨大的风险。” 没错。但你以为你（只补充）就不冒险了吗？你那样做有什么风险？“嘿，聪明的各位……我有些东西想补充。”……你冒的风险是什么？
“我们不在乎。”

## Know Your Readers

[cite_start]If you do not know your readers, the particular people in a community... you are very unlikely to create value and you are very unlikely to be persuasive. [cite: 301, 302] [cite_start]Because persuasion depends on what they doubt. [cite: 302] [cite_start]If you don't know what they doubt, how on earth are you going to overcome those doubts? [cite: 302, 303]

如果你不了解你的读者，不了解那个社群中的特定人群……你就不太可能创造价值，也不太可能有说服力。因为说服力取决于他们怀疑什么。如果你不知道他们怀疑什么，你到底要如何克服这些怀疑？

[cite_start]You must know them. [cite: 303, 304] [cite_start]It's not enough to know your subject matter. [cite: 304] [cite_start]You got to know your readers. [cite: 304, 305]

你必须了解他们。只了解你的主题是不够的。你必须了解你的读者。
