title: 更好地领导：转变阻碍你的信念
summary: 本文探讨了如何通过转变限制性信念来提升领导力。核心观点是，信念是后天习得且可塑的，而非个人身份的固有部分。通过重新构建信念，人们能够从完美主义等限制中解脱，采取与期望结果一致的行动，从而实现个人扩展和更有效的领导。

### 转变限制性信念，扩展自我

你已经发现了问题，并对其进行了深入剖析，现在你需要向前迈进，将自己从一个认为不能犯错的人转变为一个全新的人。这必须从真正相信自己能够改变开始，不是吗？如果你一直将自己定义为**完美主义者**（Perfectionist: 追求完美、不容许犯错的倾向），这便成为了你身份的一部分。你如何才能转变到一种不再持有这种信念的状态呢？很有趣的是，你甚至使用了“改变你是谁”这个说法，但实际上，我并不认为这是在改变你这个人。我认为这背后的误解在于人们将自己的**信念**（Beliefs: 对事物真实性的看法或接受）等同于自己的**身份**（Identity: 个人对自身存在的认知和定义）。

<p class="english-text">So you've uncovered, you've unpacked, and now you need to move forward and change yourself from someone who thinks they can't make mistakes to a different person. That has to start with like actually just believing that you can change, right? If you've always identified as a perfectionist, it's part of your identity. How do you sort of move to a mode in which you wouldn't believe that? So it's so interesting, Alison, that you're even using the terminology "change who you are," because actually, I don't see this as changing who you are. I think underlying this is people mistaken that their beliefs are who they are.</p>

我们所有的信念都是后天习得的。它们是我们为了在生命早期以及后续人生中，在任何特定情境下取得成功、生存或发展而学到的东西。关键在于，它们是**可塑的**（Malleable: 容易改变或影响的）。你可以根据自己真正想要的东西来改变这些信念，而不是被动地回应过去的经历。但这并不一定会改变你作为一个人本身。如果说有什么改变的话，那也是在扩展你的自我。

<p class="english-text">All of our beliefs are learned. They're what we learned in order to be successful or in order to survive or thrive in any context that we were in early on in life and as we moved through life. The key here is they're malleable. They're things that you can change according to what it is that you want rather than react to the experiences that you had in the past. But it doesn't necessarily change who you are as a person. If anything, it expands who you are.</p>

因此，当你开始从这个角度看待问题时，我认为这种心态会带来更大的开放性，让你能够说：“哦，好的，我可以采纳另一种信念”，或者“我现在可以以这种方式开始工作了”。这实际上会让你进入行动阶段：如果我采纳了这种新信念，如果我重新构建了它，并且我从“我不能犯错”转变为“我们将利用现有资源尽力做到最好”，或者“我们将利用现有信息尽力做到最好”，那么你就可以问自己：“好的，那么哪些行动与此相符，能让我达到我想要的结果呢？”

<p class="english-text">And so when you start seeing it from that perspective, I think that that is the mindset that then leads to more openness to say, oh, okay, yes, I can pick up another belief, or I can now start doing the work in this way, which then allows you to actually move into this action phase, which is if I pick up this new belief, if I've reframed it, And I've moved from, "I can't make a mistake," to, "We're going to do the best that we can with the resources that we have," or, "We're going to do the best that we can with the information that we have." Then you can say, "Okay, well, what actions align with that that will allow me to get to the outcome that I want?"</p>
