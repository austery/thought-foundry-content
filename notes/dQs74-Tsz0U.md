### 感恩节前的市场概览

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月26日，星期三。这基本上是本交易周的最后一天，也是最后一个完整的交易日。明天，由于美国迎来感恩节，市场将会休市。然后周五，我们将只有半天交易时间。因此，与今天相比，周五的交易量将会相对清淡。今天我们可能也会看到一些清淡的交易量。但就完整的交易日而言，这确实是本周的最后一天了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, November 26th. This is pretty much the final day of the trading week. It's the last full day of trading. Tomorrow, the markets will be closed because we have Thanksgiving in the States. And then on Friday, we're going to have a half day. So, the volume is just going to be relatively light compared to what we're going to see today. We're probably going to have some light volume today as well. But, it is the final day of the week in terms of a full day of trading.</p>
</details>

我们有很多内容要讨论。昨天非常重要，因为我们连续第二天收涨，这是在周一上涨1.5%的基础上实现的。这意味着标普500指数在过去几天里上涨了2.5%，几乎弥补了过去一个月跌幅的50%。所以，本周相对来说是比较强劲的。我们在盘前交易中也呈上涨态势，希望我们能保持这种涨势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. Yesterday was really important because we had a second green day in a row and that followed up Monday's 1.5% green. which means we had 2.5% on the S&P 500 in the past couple of days which made up for almost 50% of the decline that we had over the past month. So I mean it was it's been a relatively strong week. We are green in the pre-markets. Hopefully we keep up with that green.</p>
</details>

有几只股票走势非常强劲，我们将在节目开始时讨论。我们有一些关于英伟达和 Robin Hood 的头条新闻。还有一系列关于初请失业金人数的宏观数据。但总的来说，昨天市场情绪的转变在于我们更有可能迎来降息。降息的概率现在达到了83%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You got a couple of different stocks that are moving aggressively that we'll talk about as we start off the show. We have some Nvidia headlines, some Robin Hood headlines. We got a bunch of different macro data in regards to jobless claims. But overall, what turned yesterday was the idea that we are more likely to get a rate cut. Rate cut probabilities are now at 83%.</p>
</details>

标普500指数目前在677点。英伟达昨天一度下跌8%，随后反弹。虽然仍低于昨天的水平，但它确实跌破了170美元。出现了一系列不同的事件，改变了关于英伟达的市场叙事。我们还看到英伟达对谷歌做出了回应。所以，对于那些没有听说过这个回应的人，我们会详细介绍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P 500 right there at 677. Nvidia fell 8% yesterday before rebounding. Still down from where it was yesterday, but nonetheless, it hit below 170. And you just had a bunch of different things that came out that kind of shifted that narrative on Nvidia. We also had Nvidia respond to Google. So, for those that didn't hear about the response, we'll go through that.</p>
</details>

也许，仅仅是也许，我们能以一个上涨的星期进入感恩节。如果我们能让标普500指数重回680点，考虑到历史高点在689点，那将非常令人兴奋。Weeble 也在这里受到了一些关注，它的财报相当不错。市场花了一段时间才对此做出反应，但现在它在盘前上涨了8%。我不确定是否有其他头条新闻，但我们会关注一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And maybe, just maybe, we're going into Thanksgiving with a green week. And if we can reclaim 680 potentially on the S&P 500, that would be very exciting given the all-time highs are at 689. Weeble as well getting some love right here. Weeble had a good earnings. I mean, they had a pretty good earnings. It took took a while for the street to react to it, but right now that's up 8% in the pre-market. I'm not sure if there's another headline, but we'll take a look at that.</p>
</details>

今天早上的大新闻是 Robinhood (Hoodie)，它上涨了5%。所以我们将从 Hood 开始，讨论那里发生了什么，因为这确实是一些相当大的新闻。我昨晚看到了这个消息，觉得很重要，然后就睡了。醒来后我意识到，不，这真的非常重要，这就是为什么市场给予它如此大的动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Weeble is up 8%. The big story of the morning is Hoodie, which is up 5%. And so we'll start off with Hood and discuss what's happening there because it actually is some pretty big news. I saw the news last night. I thought it was important and then I kind of slept on it and I woke up realizing no, no, no, this is really important and that's why the market is giving this type of momentum to it. So we'll get into it as we as we begin talking.</p>
</details>

是的，明天是感恩节。我周五不会直播，因为要和家人在一起。所以周五不会有市场开盘直播。市场在下午1点收盘。我再次认为交易量会非常非常清淡。我们已经看到了清淡的交易量，但这基本上是本周最后一个真正的交易日了。然后我们就迎来了2025年的感恩节，再过大约一个月，2025年就要结束了。我仍然不敢相信我们已经接近年底了，但事实就是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yes, tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I will not be live on Friday going to be with family. So there will not be a market open on Friday. The markets do close at 1 p.m. Again, I think it's going to be very very light trading volume. Already we're seeing light trading volume, but yeah, this is pretty much the last like real trading trading day for this week and then we have Thanksgiving for 2025 and then we end out 2025 in about a month. I still can't believe we are getting towards the end of the year, but nonetheless, we are getting towards the end of the year.</p>
</details>

好了，让我们开始吧。我会在聊天区发起一个看涨或看跌的投票，看看大家的想法。我知道过去几天我们对这种上涨持怀疑态度。但或许有理由认为势头已经回来了，我们会讨论一些不同的头条新闻、叙事以及更广泛的宏观主题，来解释为什么牛市的叙事可能回归。今天摩根大通也发表了看法，还有一些其他银行表示：“嘿，我们仍然认为7000点是可能的。”所以，我们将讨论这是否会成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started. Let me do the green or red poll in the chat. See what people think as well. I know we were skeptical of this green over the past couple of days in a in a in a meaningful way. I mean, we we we should have that we experienced last week, but maybe there's an argument that the momentum is back and we'll talk about some of the different headlines and narratives and kind of broader macro thematics for why that narrative for the bull market and potentially. I mean, you had JP Morgan come out today. You had some other banks say, "Hey, we still think 7,000 is possible." So, we'll discuss if that ends up uh if that ends up playing up.</p>
</details>

### 感恩与社区的力量

有人说我除了观众之外还有别的家人。是的，我确实有我的现实家庭。但说实话，昨晚我和史蒂夫聊到这个，我们谈论了我们感恩的事情，我们将在直播结束时也谈谈这个话题。老实说，我说我最感恩的就是这个社区。你知道，这对我来说真的是一种使命感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, someone says you have a different family other than us. Yes, I do have my actual family. But to be honest, we were talking about this last night with Steve. We were going over what we were thankful for, which we'll talk about at the end of the stream and we'll do like a what are you thankful for? And um honestly, I said the number one thing I'm thankful for is this community. You know, it's it really is a sense of purpose for me.</p>
</details>

不，我非常感谢这个社区。非常感谢每天都能在这里。这是一种福气和荣幸。我每天早上都告诉自己，能够做这件事，能够表达我的想法、观点和我整理的研究并将其分享给世界。我真的不认为这是理所当然的。我努力确保每天都不把它视为理所当然，因为这是一个非常优越的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But no, very thankful for the community. Uh very thankful for being here every single day. It it is a blessing and privilege. I tell myself every morning to be able to do this and be able to express my thoughts and opinions and research that I'm compiling and give it to the world. And uh I I just I really don't take it for granted. I I try to make sure every day to to not take it for granted because it it is a very privileged position to be in.</p>
</details>

没有观众，就没有节目。社区就没有价值，什么都没有。那就只是一个对着摄像头说话的人，这基本上就是现在的情况。这只是一个对着摄像头说话的家伙。如果你记录下我的一天是什么样子，如果有人只是在墙上放个摄像头记录我所做的一切，那看起来会很滑稽，因为说实话，那看起来有点疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um you know without the audience there is no show. There is there is no value to the community. There's nothing. So there's just a guy talking into his camera which is still basically what this is. It's just a guy talking into a like dude I if you recorded what my day looks like if someone just like had a camera on the wall and just recorded what I do. It's like it looks hilarious because it it looks kind of crazy to be honest.</p>
</details>

我非常非常感激我们作为一个社区在这里，我们能够作为一个社区共同应对起伏。我们所有人都在努力提升我们的财务独立性，这是核心。这就是我们都在努力做的事情。我们试图参与那些对我们生活有根本影响的内容，而不是那些没有影响的内容。我们都在聊天室里交流，发送更新，关注新闻，因为我们都在努力提升我们过上更好生活的能力。而金钱和财务独立通常是能够过上更好生活的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um very very very very grateful that we are here as a community that we are all able to deal with the ups and downs as a community and all of us are trying to increase our financial independence at its core. That's all what that we're all that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to engage in content that is not content that that that fundamentally doesn't have an impact on our lives. But we're all talking in the chat, sending updates, looking at news because we're trying to increase the ability for us to have a better life. And usually money and financial independence is at the epicenter of being able to have a better life.</p>
</details>

说到家庭，我认为我们很多人都是为了我们的家庭而这么做。所以非常感谢今天以及全年都在这里的每一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and a lot of us you know speaking of family I think are doing this for our families. So very great very grateful for everyone to be here today and to be here throughout the entire year.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济数据：就业市场与降息预期

好了，让我们开始吧。在谈论 Robin Hood 之前，先看看初请失业金人数，这个数据好于预期。所以这个失业问题对劳动力市场来说仍然是个问题，而更广泛的市场正试图弄清楚劳动力市场到底发生了什么，至少从降息的角度来看是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right let's get started. Let's get into it. Before I get into Robin Hood first jobless claims uh they came in better than expected. So this unemployment story continues to be an issue for the labor market and the broader market is trying to figure out what's happening in the labor market at least from a rate cut perspective.</p>
</details>

美国上周，即11月22日当周的初请失业金人数降至21.6万人。市场普遍预期为22.5万人。所以这是个好消息。这意味着我们并没有像之前政府停摆、数据缺失时一些人担心的那样，每周出现35万到37.5万的失业人数，那样的数字将符合经济衰退的定义。我们没有到那个地步。我们现在是20万左右，这个数字相对温和。坦白说，这个数字低于我们在七月、八月、九月的移动平均值，当时更接近22.2万或22.4万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">US jobless claims fell to 216,000 for last week, the week of November 22nd. Uh consensus was 225,000. So this is good. It means we are not again when we were we when we weren't getting data when the government was shut down, some people were thinking we were having 350 to 375,000 job losses a week, which would qualify as a recession. We're not there. We're not there. We're at 200. This is relatively tame. Quite frankly, this number is lower than the moving average that we had in the months of July and August, September, which was closer to 222,000 or 224,000.</p>
</details>

所以，我们现在处于21.6万到22万的水平，基本上在平均值的正负2%范围内，这是非常好的。这意味着劳动力市场没有在恶化。现在，有些人可能会说，那意味着我们不会降息了。不，劳动力市场仍在走弱，这就是为什么降息概率是82.9%，但它没有在恶化。这是一个非常重要的细微差别，因为如果我们没有恶化，我们就有机会通过降息来拯救劳动力市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the fact that we're at 216 220, we're basically within the plus two or plus two plus or minus 2% of the average is very good. It means the labor market is not deteriorating. Now, some people might be saying, well, that means we're not getting a rate cut. No, labor market's still weakening, which is why the probabilities are 82.9%, but it's not deteriorating. And that's a very important nuance because if we are not deteriorating, we have a chance to save the labor market with rate cuts.</p>
</details>

也许人工智能的力量如此强大，它将导致如此多的失业，以至于降息也无济于事。那是后话了，我们拭目以待。但从经济学角度来看，如果失业率在4.4%，我们应该在它达到4.9%之前降息。因为它不可避免地会达到4.9%。如果我们能有效地推迟这种情况的发生，那将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, maybe AI is so powerful and it's going to lead to so many job losses that rate cuts can't do anything. That's a story for another day. We'll see how that plays out. But economically, there should be a world in which if unemployment's at 4.4%, we should cut rates before it gets to 4.9%. Because inevitably it will get to 4.9%. And if we can delay that from happening in a meaningful way, then that would be important.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，这些数据都不会改变美联储对降息的看法。再次强调，降息并非板上钉钉，但82.9%的概率，鲍威尔通常不喜欢给市场参与者带来意外。现在，如果概率是80%，除非他或约翰·威廉姆斯、玛丽·戴利或克里斯托弗·沃勒站出来彻底改变说法，说：“不，我认为我们不应该降息”，而他们所有人之前都表示我们应该降息。甚至前达拉斯联储主席昨天也站出来说：“我们可能应该降息。”那么，看起来我们将会得到这次降息。而这将对维持目前的强劲势头非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think none of this changes the data in terms of how the Fed is thinking of the rate cut. Again, it's not guaranteed. We get it, but 82.9% JPAL usually does not like to surprise the market participants. And now, if the probabilities are 80%, unless him or John Williams or Mary Daly or Christopher Waller come out and completely flip the script and say, "No, I don't think we should have a rate cut," which all of them have been saying we should have a rate cut. Even the former Dallas Fed president yesterday came out and said, "We should probably have a rate cut." Uh, then it looks like we're going to get this rate cut. And that would be very important to continue having this momentum uh as strong as it is.</p>
</details>

这就是我们目前的情况，也基本上是宏观数据的全部内容。还有一些其他的宏观数据我们会看，但初请失业金人数是今天最重要的数据，这就是我们周三早上得到的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's what we've got going on and that is kind of the extent of the macro data. There's a couple other pieces of macro data we'll look at but the jobless games was the big one and that's what we got this morning for Wednesday.</p>
</details>

### Robinhood 的战略举措：垂直整合预测市场

让我们来谈谈 Robinhood (Hoodie) 以及正在发生的事情。Robinhood 目前在盘前交易中上涨5%的原因，也许这会保持，也许不会。顺便说一句，这差不多是我对 Hood 的公允价值。如果今年年底我们收在120美元，我会很高兴。我不认为我们应该像上周那样在100美元，也不认为我们应该在150美元。我认为我们最终会远远超过150美元，但现在经济不确定性和波动性仍然太大。有很多不同的理由说明我们不应该为 Hood 赋予那么高的市盈率，但我认为120美元是一个非常好的平衡点。所以，如果我们能在这个区间稳定下来，那将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood, let's talk about Robin Hoodie and what's going on. The reason Robin Hood is up 5% right now in the pre-markets and maybe this holds, maybe it doesn't. By the way, this is kind of my fair value for Hood. If we end out the year at 120, I will be a happy guy. I don't think we should be at 100 like we were last week. And I don't think we should be at 150. I think inevitably we will be much farther beyond 150, but I think there's still too much economic uncertainty, volatility. You don't know what 2026 is going to be like. There's a lot of different arguments for why we shouldn't pull forward that much of a multiple for Hood, but I think 120 is a very good sweet spot. And so I think if we can normalize this range, then that would be very important.</p>
</details>

我们今天为什么会看到这样的涨幅？嗯，Robinhood 昨晚给了 Kalshi 一个大大的中指。Robinhood 正在通过与 Susquehanna（世界上最大的做市商之一）成立新的合资企业，来扩大其预测市场业务，以运营一个受 **CFTC** (Commodity Futures Trading Commission: 美国商品期货交易委员会，负责监管美国商品期货和期权市场) 许可的交易所和清算账户。基本上，他们正在垂直整合这些预测市场的整个清算、做市和流动性提供过程。他们并没有完全脱离 Kalshi，但看起来 Vlad 已经厌倦了与 Kalshi 分享每份合约两美分的收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why are we getting that today? Well, Robin Hood just gave a big middle finger to Kalshi last night. Robin Hood expanding their prediction markets offering through a new joint venture with Susuana, which is one of the largest market makers in the world to operate a CFTC licensed exchange and clear accounts. Basically, they're vertically integrating the entire process of the clearing and the market making and liquidity for these prediction markets. And they're not completely off of call sheet, but it looks like Vlad is tired of splitting those two cents per contract with Khei.</p>
</details>

Susquehanna 将作为关键合作伙伴和初始流动性提供商，未来还会增加其他流动性提供商。预测市场是 Robinhood 增长最快的收入来源，第一年就有超过一百万客户交易了90亿份合约。这个新交易所，本质上是 Robinhood 旗下的一个联合子公司，Susquehanna 将持有其10%的股份。它将作为合资企业独立运营，由 Robinhood 作为控股方，提供零售需求和分销渠道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Susuana will serve as a key partner in the initial liquidity provider with additional liquidity providers added over time. Prediction markets on Robinet's fastest growing revenue line with 9 billion contracts traded by over a million customers in the first year. And the new exchange, which is essentially what this is, it's like a joint subsidiary under Robin Hood that they're going to o that Susuana is going to own a 10% stake of. Uh it's going to operate independently as a joint venture with Robin Hood as the controlling partner providing retail demand and distribution.</p>
</details>

我一直在等待这个消息。很多看好 Robinhood 的人也一直在等待。预测市场正在不断增长。这是一个新的亿美元级别的业务线。我认为在未来几年内，它将成为一个十亿美元级别的业务线。目前，我认为 Piper Sandler 估计 Robinhood 明年将在预测市场上赚取2.5亿美元。这可能是5亿美元，但他们要分给 Kalshi 1美分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I've been waiting for this. A lot of Robin Hood bulls have been waiting for this. I mean, prediction markets are growing more and more and more. This is a new hundred million dollar line of business. I think in the next couple years it's going to be a billion dollar line of business. Right now I think Piper Sandler is estimating 250 million per year Robin Hood is making on prediction markets or they will make next year. That's could be 500 million but they give 1 cent to Kalshi.</p>
</details>

而 Kalshi 给了他们什么？什么都没有。Robinhood 拥有所有的分销渠道，拥有所有的营销。嗯，Robinhood 并不真的需要做营销。Kalshi 变成了一个蹩脚的营销机器，搞了各种糟糕的影响者活动，因为他们没有任何专有技术，预测市场是一种商品。但 Robinhood 拥有2700万客户，他们有一个非常粘性的生态系统和用户体验，愿意尝试新产品，并且显然交易量非常大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what does KHI give them? Nothing. Robin Hood has all the distribution. Robin Hood has all the marketing. Robin Hood well Robin doesn't really need to do the marketing. Kalshi turns into this cringe marketing machine with all these like horrible influencer campaigns because they have nothing proprietary because prediction markets are a commodity. But Robin Hood has 27 million customers that have a very sticky ecosystem and user experience that would be willing to try a new product and are obviously showing that the volumes are very intense.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为对 Vlad 来说，很明显，我们为什么要继续与另一家交易所合作？我们一开始这样做只是为了启动业务，但没有理由仅仅因为我们使用了他们做市商的一部分流动性，就将每份合约的50%收益分给他们。因此，我认为市场现在的反应非常明显，他们认为：“等等，如果 Robinhood 能将这部分收入翻倍……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think for Vlad, it's very obvious why would we keep partnering with another exchange? We did it in the beginning just to get things started, but there's no reason we should be giving them 50% of every contract just because we're using uh part of their liquidity from a market making perspective. So, I think it's very obvious that the market right here is just saying, "Wait a second. If Robin Hood can double those revenues..."</p>
</details>

我认为这不会很快发生，但随着时间的推移，你会开始看到那1美分变成1.2美分，然后是1.3，再是1.4，最终变成完整的每份合约2美分。到那时，预测市场的收入将迎来它的**S型曲线**（S-curve: 一种描述新技术或新业务从初期缓慢增长，到中期快速爆发，再到后期增长放缓的典型模式）时刻，这实际上可以抵消加密货币业务的影响。过去几个月加密货币市场一直死气沉沉，这意味着 Robinhood 第四季度的加密货币交易量可能不会太好。这也是 Robinhood 股价下跌的原因之一，因为加密货币市场不景气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon, but I think over time, you're going to start to see that 1 cent turn into 1.2, then 1.3, then 1.4, then eventually a full 2 cents per contract." And that's when the revenue from prediction markets pretty much has its S-curve moment, which actually counteracts crypto. Crypto has been dead for the past couple months, which means Robin Hood crypto volumes going into Q4 probably are not going to be that good. That's also why Robin Hood's stock has been down because crypto has been down.</p>
</details>

但如果加密货币不再是唯一的90%利润率的收入来源，而你有这个叫做预测市场的新业务，它对 Hood 来说实际上更好，而且他们通过这些预测市场赚的钱比加密货币还多——虽然现在还不是这样，但如果随着时间的推移情况如此——那么这个业务就不像加密货币那样具有周期性。它不像比特币生态系统那样受制于市场的反复无常。它只是，嘿，人们想在超级碗上交易，所以人们可能会在超级碗上交易。如果他们想在 Robinhood 上交易，那么 Robinhood 就会捕获大量的交易量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if crypto is not the only 90% margin source of revenue and you have this new thing called prediction markets that are actually way better for Hood and they're making even more money than they're making on crypto with these prediction markets, which is not the case yet, but over time if that is the case, that's not as cyclical as crypto. That's not as contingent on the whims of the, you know, Bitcoin ecosystem. That's just, hey, like people want to trade on the Super Bowl, so people are probably going to trade on the Super Bowl. they want to trade on Robin Hood, then Robin Hood is going to capture a lot of that volume.</p>
</details>

所以，从我的角度来看，我认为这对他们来说是一件非常非常强大的事情，这就是为什么市场正在为此定价。有人评论说：“我敢打赌，Robinhood 正在收购的交易所 MIAX 的收购报价一定非常优惠。”是的，我们没有收购价格，但我百分之百同意。通常当 Robinhood 参与这些合资企业时，他们都能得到非常好的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, from my perspective, I think it's a really really strong thing for them to do and that's why the market is kind of pricing it in right here. Uh Benny says, "I bet the proposed acquisition price ask of MIAX, which is the exchange Robin is acquiring was for a great price." Yeah, we don't have the acquisition price, but 100% agreed. I mean, usually when Robin engages in these joint ventures, they get a really good deal.</p>
</details>

再说一次，他们提供了大量的分销渠道。所以，对于 Susquehanna 来说，他们的工作归根结底是为所有交易股票、加密货币、未来可能出现的代币化资产以及现在的预测市场的不同交易所提供流动性。他们只想要交易量。如果 Robinhood 能给他们带来交易量，那么我认为他们会获得更多的动力。这就是 Robinhood 上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, they're offering a ton of distribution. So, Susuana, which at the end of the day, their job is to provide liquidity to all the different exchanges that are trading stocks, crypto, uh, tokenized assets potentially in the future, now prediction markets, they just want volume. And if Robin can give them volume, then that's why I think they're going to get, uh, a lot more momentum. So, that's the reason Robinet is up.</p>
</details>

现在，有些人对预测市场持有意识形态上的观点，认为它是赌博，这没关系。人们可以对此有自己的看法，但关键是人们会进行交易。如果人们要交易，他们会使用 DraftKings、Coinbase、Kalshi、Poly Market 还是 Robinhood？如果他们最终选择使用 Hood，那么 Hood 就应该捕获大部分的交易量。对于股东来说，这些交易量将转化为大量的收入，坦白说，还有大量的利润，因为 Robinhood 运营这类业务的间接成本并不高。因此，从这个角度来看，市场正在给予更高的定价，这就是你现在看到 Robinhood 股价上涨5%的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, the ideological opinion some people have about prediction markets being gambling, again, that's fine. People can have their own perspective on this, but the point is people are going to trade. And if people are going to trade, are they gonna use DraftKings, Coinbase, Kyle, Poly Market, Robin Hood? If they're going to end up using Hood, then Hood should capture the majority of that volume. And if for shareholders, uh, that volume will translate into a lot of revenues and quite frankly, a lot of profits because Robin Hood does not have a lot of overhead to run that type of business. So from that perspective, the market's pricing it higher and that's why you're seeing that 5% move on Robin Hood at the moment.</p>

### 英伟达风波：股价波动与官方回应

让我们来谈谈英伟达。哇，股价到了180美元。我们在这里看到了2%的涨幅。我没看到我们在盘前交易中突破180美元。好的，英伟达181美元。我知道你们很多人在何塞上节目时以169美元的价格抄底了。我是在170.80美元买入的，这是我一段时间以来第一次购买英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Nvidia, let's talk about Nvidia. So Nvidia share, wow, 180. We're actually getting a move here up 2%. Uhhuh. I didn't I didn't see us break 180 in the pre-markets. All right, 181 on Nvidia. I know a lot of you guys bought the dip at 169 when Jose came on the show. I got 170.80. Uh first time in a while that I bought Nvidia.</p>
</details>

我认为我们中很多昨天利用这次下跌机会的人，首要原因就是这个 **TPU** (Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路) 的事情对英伟达来说不会是世界末日。而且我认为我们开始看到市场正在将这种认识反映在价格中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean, I think a lot of us who took advantage of the dip yesterday, the number one reason was because this TPU thing is not going to be the end of the world for Nvidia. And uh I I think we're starting to see the manifestation of that get priced in by the markets.</p>
</details>

再次强调，这是在财报发布之后。英伟达现在的市盈率是明年盈利的25倍。对我来说，这并不处于最泡沫的区域，但英伟达做出了回应。这是他们昨天对谷歌说的话：“我们为谷歌的成功感到高兴。他们在人工智能领域取得了巨大进步，我们将继续为谷歌供货。英伟达领先行业一代。它是唯一一个能运行所有AI模型，并且在任何计算场景下都能做到的平台。英伟达提供比 **ASIC** (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits: 专用集成电路，为特定框架或功能设计的芯片) 更高的性能、通用性和可互换性。”

<p class="english-text">Again, this is after the earnings. Nvidia is now trading at 25 times next year's earnings. It's not it's not in the most bubbish of territories to me, but Nvidia responded. So, this is what they said yesterday to Google. We're delighted by Google's success. They've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply to Google. Nvidia is the generation or Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry. It's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than AS6, which are designed for specific a frameworks or functions.</p>
</details>

好了，如果你讨厌这个回应，请在聊天区告诉我，因为我认为大家的看法是五五开。坦白说，可能更像是70%的人讨厌这个回应，30%的人觉得没问题。我属于认为他们回应没什么大不了的那一派。我理解为什么人们会感到恼火，他们觉得英伟达根本不应该关注这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, put in the chat if you hated this response because I think it was 50/50. Quite frankly, it was probably 7030. 70% of people hating the response, 30% of people being okay with it. Um, I'm in the camp that it's not that big of a deal that they responded. I understand why people are annoyed and they're just like, Nvidia shouldn't even be giving this any level of focus.</p>
</details>

他们前几天也回应了迈克尔·贝瑞，顺便说一句，迈克尔·贝瑞今天早上又发推了。他说：“与世界上最有价值的公司发生争执，是我见过的最好的 Substack 增长策略之一。”迈克尔·贝瑞今天早上回应了英伟达的回应，然后如果英伟达再来来回回地回应他对他回应的回应，然后贝瑞又有新的东西可以回应。我的意思是，我绝对不认为英伟达应该回应他在 Substack 上博客文章的第二部分，因为到那个地步就变得很愚蠢了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they responded to Michael Bur the other day, which by the way, Michael Bur tweeted again this morning. Let me just say getting into a beef with the world's most valuable company is one of the single best Substack growth strategies I've ever seen. Michael Bur this morning responding to Nvidia's response and then if Nvidia goes back and forth and responds to his response of the response and then Bur has something else to respond to. I mean I I definitely don't think Nvidia should respond to his part two of his blog post on his Substack where he goes deep into it because like at that point it's just becoming stupid.</p>
</details>

但他们确实向卖方分析师发送了一份备忘录，引用了迈克尔·贝瑞的说法，而贝瑞很喜欢这样，因为他得到了所有的关注，因为一个4万亿美元的公司在说：“嘿，这家伙说了这个，这是我们的回应。”所以每个人都在想：“嗯，这个说这些话的家伙是谁？他为什么这么重要？”首先，这提升了他的品牌知名度。其次，如果他只是个无名小卒，你为什么觉得有必要回应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but they did send a memo to the Southside analysts about and they they cited Michael Bur's claims and Bur loves it because he's getting all the attention because a$4 trillion dollar company is like, "Hey, this guy said this and here's our response." And so everyone's like, "Well, who is this guy that said this? Why is he so important?" Number one, which just increases his brand. And then two, why do you feel like you have to respond if he's just some random guy?</p>
</details>

我认为英伟达，我对这件事的看法以及他们昨天回应谷歌的原因，和黄仁勋在 Deepseek 事件期间做的事情是一样的。当 Deepseek 事件发生时，英伟达股价跌至每股90美元。他们做出了回应，只是说：“嘿，这是我们看待市场的方式。这是我们认为推理和推理需求的发展方向。这就是为什么我们认为这没什么大不了的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think Nvidia, my my take on this and the reason they respond to Google yesterday as well, it's the same thing that Jensen did during Deepseek. When Deepseek happened, Nvidia fell to 90 bucks a share. They responded and they just said, "Hey, this is how we see the market. This is where we think the demand for inferencing inferencing and reasoning is going. This is why we think this is not that big of a deal."</p>
</details>

我认为黄仁勋骨子里有那股狠劲。我真的认为他有那股狠劲，他就像是：“在我们交出了股市历史上最好的季度财报之后，你还敢说我们公司的坏话。”坦白说，我认为黄仁勋很生气。我认为他很生气，因为分析师想要610亿，他说：“我给你650亿。”分析师想要490亿的数据中心收入，他说：“我们给你520亿。”分析师预期58.3%的增长，他说：“我给你62.4%的增长。”分析师预期72%的毛利率，他说：“我们给你73.4%。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think Jensen I think Jensen has that dog in him. I really think he has that dog in him. and he's just like, "You're going to talk [ __ ] about my company after we delivered the single best quarter in the history of the stock market." I think Jensen, quite frankly, I think he's pissed off. I think he's pissed off because the analyst wanted 61 billion. He said, "I'll give you 65." The analyst wanted 49 billion of data center revenue. He said, "We'll give you 52." The analyst expected 58.3% growth. He said, "I'll give you 62.4% growth." The analyst expected 72% gross margins. He said, "We'll give you 73.4."</p>
</details>

我的意思是，他做了你能想象到的一切。而股票从财报发布后下跌了15%。我认为他只是觉得，如果股价下跌是因为那个该死的贝瑞和谷歌，以及那些发布没有细节的报告，但这些头条新闻却让我们一天之内损失了3000亿美元的市值，那么我们就直接回应。人们可以想说什么就说什么，但我们必须在这种情况下为自己辩护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, he did every single thing you could possibly imagine. And the stock is down 15%. from earnings and and I think he's just like, you know what, if it's down because of freaking Bur and Google and the information putting out these reports that have no details, but these headlines are causing us to lose $300 billion in market cap on a day, then we're just going to respond and people can say whatever we want, but we will have to defend ourselves in the midst of this.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这就是黄仁勋回应的原因。我能理解这被视为软弱的看法，但我也能理解他只是想说：“去你们的。我们不在乎你们怎么想。这是我们的回应，接受与否随你，但很多这些人的分析要么是不正确的，要么是微不足道的，要么是真正忽略了关键点。”所以我认为英伟达不是出于弱势才这么做的，因为数字本身就说明了一切。但我认为，归根结底，如果数字不能说服市场，那么英伟达可能就必须站出来说些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think that's why Jensen's responding. I can understand the perception of it being weak, but I can also understand him just being like, "Screw you guys. Like, we don't care what you think. This is our response. take it or leave it, but uh the analysis from a lot of these people is just incorrect or insignificant or really misses a key point and that's why I think Nvidia's so I don't think they're doing it from a position of weakness I would say because the numbers do all the talking but I think at the end of the day if the numbers aren't leading to the market being convinced and that's where Nvidia might have to come out and say something.</p>

### 科技巨头动态：Meta、微软及其他

英伟达股价180.88美元。在财报发布后，股价上涨了1.7%。它仍然是“七巨头”中最便宜的股票之一，与谷歌和 Meta 并列。现在微软也开始变得更便宜了，尽管微软现在，哇，微软也上涨了2%。所有科技股都得到了一点提振。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia right there 180.88 88. That's up 1.7% again after those earnings. It continues to be one of the cheapest Mac 7s uh along with Google and Meta. And now Microsoft, which is starting to get cheaper, even though Microsoft is now, Wow, Microsoft up 2% as well. All of tech getting a little bit of a boost right.</p>
</details>

Meta 下跌是因为他们正在接受意大利的调查。意大利的监管机构站出来说，Meta 又是一个垄断企业。所以我认为这就是为什么 Meta 股价下跌，否则它可能会冲上640美元。昨天它表现很好，上涨了3.7%。所以，你有那个意大利监管机构的头条新闻。也许还有其他头条，但那是我看到的，也是 Meta 下跌的原因。而英伟达则领涨，当天上涨了1.75%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta is down because they're getting investigated by Italy. the Italian watchdog came out and like I said, Meta is a monopoly again. So, I think that's why otherwise Meta probably would be pushing 640. Had a big day yesterday, up 3.7%. So, you've got that Italian watchdog headline. Maybe there's another headline, but that's the one I saw and that's why Meta is down. And you got Nvidia leading it up 1.75% on the day as well.</p>
</details>

意大利反垄断机构表示，已扩大对 Meta 的调查范围，指控该公司通过在即时通讯服务 WhatsApp 上使用人工智能工具滥用其市场主导地位。所以，意大利基本上是说 WhatsApp 是一个垄断企业，而 Meta 基本上不允许任何其他竞争对手参与竞争。我认为这没什么大不了的，但无论如何，这就是为什么该股票在盘前交易中下跌了约1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Italy's antitrust authority said it has broadened the scope of its investigation into MetaT over allegations of the company abusing its dominant position through the use of artificial intelligence tools on messaging service WhatsApp. Okay, so Italy is basically saying that WhatsApp is a monopoly and that Meta is like basically not allowing any other competitors to compete. I think it's kind of nothing but nonetheless that's why that stock is down about 1% right here in the pre-markets.</p>

### 意外的消费韧性：零售股强势反弹

总的来说，我们是上涨的。总的来说，我们涨得相当不错。看到一些这样的势头是件好事。我知道我们的交易量很低，但如果这种情况持续下去，那么也许我们会在年底前看到一些更广泛的兴奋情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So overall, we're green. Overall, we're pretty damn green. And it is nice to see some of this momentum. I know we have low volume, but if that continues, then maybe we get some uh some broader excitement going into the end of the year.</p>
</details>

我们都能感觉到叙事又在发生一些变化吗？整个AI泡沫论，Oswath 上周在播客上说一切都会破裂，苹果是你唯一的安全港等等。然后，价格走势发生了变化，人们开始意识到，等等，财报是真的。降息的可能性更大了，人们开始问，也许现在不是泡沫了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, can we all kind of feel the narrative shifting again a little bit? You know, this whole AI bubble, Osw going on podcasts last week saying that everything's going to pop. Apple's your only form of safety, yada yada. And then it's like price action changes. people start realizing, wait a second, the earnings are real. You get more of a chance of a rate cut and people start asking, maybe it's not a bubble now.</p>
</details>

也许是。我不认为我们已经脱离险境。我不认为这是泡沫，但我也不认为我们已经脱离险境，但也许情况不像昨天或上周那么悲观了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe it is. I don't think we're out of the woods. I don't think it's a bubble, but I also don't think we're out of the woods, but maybe it's not as doomeristic as it was yesterday or as it was last week.</p>
</details>

好了，让我们来谈谈零售股。对于昨天关注过零售ETF XRT的人来说，它创下了五个月来的最佳单日表现。今天在盘前交易中又上涨了0.5%。我认为理解这一点非常重要，因为“消费者已崩溃”的说法正在受到一些挑战。Abercrombie & Fitch 昨天上涨了37%。Kohl's 昨天上涨了42%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So let's talk about retail stocks. For anyone who looked at XRT, which is the retail ETF yesterday, uh it had its best day in five months. It's up another half a percent right here in the pre-markets. And I think this is really important to understand because the consumer is broken narrative is being challenged a little bit. Abracmbry and Fitch was up 37% yesterday. Kohl's was up 42% yesterday.</p>
</details>

Best Buy 昨天也表现出色，上涨了5%。然后是那个我完全无法理解的，Urban Outfitters 在财报后上涨了15%，而白天已经上涨了9%。这些不是沃尔玛、塔吉特、好市多。这些是销售75美元牛仔裤的利基零售商。Best Buy 不一定是利基零售商，但人们必须购买大量电子产品，才能让 Best Buy 在沃尔玛、塔吉特、苹果等常规购物地点之外获得这种势头。所以，他们去 Best Buy 购物并使其股价上涨5%，这是非常令人印象深刻的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Best Buy was up I don't think they were up as much but they were up a bit. Uh Best Buy was up, no Best Buy had a great day yesterday. Best Buy was up 5%. And then the one that completely I could not understand this, Urban Outfitters was up 15% yesterday after earnings after being up 9% during the day. These are not your Walmarts, your Targets, your Costos. These are niche retailers that sell $75 jeans. Best Buy is not necessarily a niche retailer, but still Best Buy, you know, I mean, people have to shop for a lot of electronics for uh Best Buy to get that momentum over the typical places they could go, like a Walmart, a Target, an Apple, etc. So, the fact that they're going to Best Buy and it's getting a 5% move is very impressive.</p>
</details>

然后，整体零售ETF上涨了5%。现在，为什么零售ETF上涨了5%？因为我们昨天得到的所有零售销售数据，我认为是0.2%，而预期是3%。所以9月份的数据比预期的要低一些，但归根结底，你把这些放在一起看，人们肯定是在花钱购物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you have the overall retailer ETF that's up 5%. Now, why is the retail ETF up 5%? Because it seems like all of the retail sales data we got, we got yesterday, I think it was 02 versus 3% expected. So for September, so it was a little bit lower than expected, but at the end of the day, I mean, you put two and two together, people have to be buying things.</p>
</details>

是的，Burlington 的财报也很好。人们必须用可支配收入来购物，尤其是在像 Abercrombie 这样的地方，这些地方的商品价格偏高，才能让这些股票上涨。所以这真的让人不禁要问，等等，我们刚刚从 Chipotle、星巴克和 Lululemon 那里听到了所有这些相互矛盾的数据，说消费者正在挣扎，他们过得并不好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Burlington also had a great earnings. People have to be buying things with disposable income, especially at places like Abbercrombie, which again are a bit more on the high end. Um, for these stocks to go higher. And so it it really begs the question, wait a second, we we just heard all this uh uh I guess conflicting data from Chipotle, Starbucks, and Lululemon over the past couple of weeks that the consumer is struggling. They're not really doing that well.</p>
</details>

我仍然认为那些数据是真实的，而且我认为很难否认我们看到的关于低端消费者的其他形式的经济数据，特别是如果你看次级汽车贷款、学生贷款和信用卡拖欠率，这些都处于11年来的高点。但也许是 Chipotle 的食物难吃，也许是星巴克的咖啡难喝，也许是 Lululemon 就是没有好的时尚潮流，因为 Urban Outfitters 上涨了16%。真的，Abercrombie 上涨了35%。我的意思是，这是市场在说：“不，我们认为零售商回来了，我们认为人们在购物。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I still think that data is true, and I think it's hard to deny some of the the other forms of economic data that we're seeing in regards to the lower end consumer, particularly if you look at subprime auto, um student loans, and and credit card delinquencies, which are at like 11-year highs. But maybe Chipotle food sucks. Maybe Starbucks coffee sucks. Maybe Lululemon just doesn't have good uh hip millennial fashion trends because Urban Outfitters up 16%. Like really, Abbercrombie up 35%. I mean, that's the market saying, "No, we think retailers are back and we think people are shopping."</p>
</details>

如果你明年得到一个宽松的美联储，如果你保持AI的叙事，如果你得到至少13%到15%的盈利增长，并且消费者可能回归，我的意思是，这对明年来说是一个非常好的局面。所以，我会对这些数据持保留态度，并尝试看看我们即将公布的其他一些零售财报。但我确实没想到这些利基零售品牌能交出这样的财报。即使是 Dick's，他们昨天也在营收和利润上都超出了预期。所以你看到这么多公司都取得了相当不错的业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you get an easing Fed next year, if you get the AI narrative intact, if you get earnings growth of at least 13 to 15% and you get the consumer potentially coming back, I mean, that's a really good setup for next year. So, I'm going to take this data with a grain of salt and I'm going to try to look at some of the other retail earnings that we have coming up. But like, I did not expect these niche retail brands to put up the types of earnings that they put up. Even Dicks, they beat on the top and the bottom yesterday as well. So, you're just seeing so many of these companies have a pretty decent earnings.</p>

### 华尔街展望：摩根大通与美国银行的预测

宏观方面，情况如何？摩根大通会给出两个观点，一个看涨，一个看跌。摩根大通表示，如果美联储继续降息，标普500指数将在2026年达到8000点。在其2026年全球股票展望中，该银行预测全球股市将实现两位数的增长，这得益于强劲的盈利、较低的利率和宽松的政策压力。预计美国将继续是主要的增长引擎，受到有弹性的经济和AI驱动的投资热潮的支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">macro, okay, what's going on? So JP Morgan will give two perspectives, one bullish, one bear. JP Morgan says S&P 500 8,000 in 2026 if the Fed continues to cut rates. In its 2026 global equity outlook, the bank forecasts doubledigit global equity gains driven by strong earnings, lower rates, and easing policy pressures. The US is expected to remain the main growth engine supported by a resilient economy and an AIdriven investment boom.</p>
</details>

摩根大通预计未来两年美国公司的盈利将增长15%，并表示高估值是合理的，因为AI资本支出加速、股东回报增加以及潜在的政策顺风。该银行还警告说，AI的快速颠覆可能会放大现有的经济失衡，并导致投资者情绪波动。所以他们基本上是说，嘿，我们认为到2026年底可能会达到8000点，也许是7500点，尽管这将是一段颠簸的旅程，其论据是美联储宽松政策和AI交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">JP Morgan expects 15% earnings growth for US companies over the next two years and says high valuations are justified by accelerating AI capex rising shareholder payouts and potential policy tailwinds. The bank also warn warned that rapid AI disruption could amplify existing economic imbalances and lead to volatile investor sentiment. So basically they're saying hey we think it gets to 8,000 probably 7500 by end of 2026 although it will be a bumpy ride and the argument is Fed easing AI trade right if you have to summarize it.</p>
</details>

然后美国银行站出来说：“我们认为到2026年底，标普500指数可能勉强超过7100点。”美国银行预测盈利增长14%，但警告说流动性支持正在减弱，未来回购减少、资本支出增加、央行降息有限。它预测该指数的范围在5500到8500之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then Bank of America came out and said, "We think the S&P 500 might barely be above 7100 at the end of 2026." Bank of America forecasts 14% earnings growth, but warns that liquidity support is fading with fewer buybacks, higher capex, and limited central bank cuts ahead. It projects a 5500 to 8500 range for the index.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，如果你是一家银行，有很多人为你的分析付费，而你说：“嗯，它可能是5500或8500。”我的意思是，我们在这里谈论什么？你有一份工作，那就是预测。你可能在工作上出错，但为了保全自己而给出从低端到高端的预测范围，我不知道。那有点太过了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which, by the way, if you're a bank and you have a lot of people paying you for your analysis, and you say, "Well, it could be 5500 or 8,500." I mean, like, what are we talking about here? Like, like you you have one job and it's to predict. You might be wrong at your job, but to cover your ass by going from the low end to the high end. I don't know. That's that's a little too aggressive there.</p>
</details>

该公司预计市场领导地位将发生转变，资本支出超过消费，蓝领超过白领，将必需消费品评级上调至增持，并因AI而下调非必需消费品评级。美国银行认为近期可能出现疲软，称AI的货币化仍不确定，电力需求上升可能成为瓶颈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The firm expects a shift in market leadership, capex over consumption, blue collar over white collar, raising staples to overweight and lowering discretionary on AI. Bank of America seen potential near-term weakness saying monetization remains uncertain and rising power demands could be a bottleneck.</p>
</details>

请记住，美国银行在年初时，并且一直坚持到七月，都说我们不会降息。具有讽刺意味的是，在第一次降息之前，他们最终说：“不，我们可能要降息了。”所以，我不是因为他们看跌才挑剔他们，但他们在整个年度都错了。我认为他们这里的论点没有多大意义。他们说我们将有14%的盈利增长，摩根大通说15%。但流动性支持正在减弱。所以他们是说：“嘿，你会有更高的盈利，但你不会有美联储的支持。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Remember, Bank of America at the beginning of the year and they stuck with this until July said we would not get a rate cut. Ironically, before the first rate cut, they ended up saying, "No, we're probably going to get a rate cut." So, I mean, again, I'm not just picking on them because they're bearish, but they have been wrong throughout the entirety of the year. And I think the argument right here doesn't make a lot of sense. They're saying that we're going to have 14% earnings growth. JP Morgan says 15%. But liquidity support is fading. So, they're saying, "Hey, you're going to have bigger earnings, but you're not going to have the Fed on your side."</p>
</details>

从我们听到的关于美联储的一切来看，即使鲍威尔六个月不降息，下一任美联储主席很可能是凯文·哈塞特。如果是凯文·哈塞特，他会降低利率。所以，我不知道在考虑美联储时，这是否会是世界上最可怕的事情。我们很可能会以某种方式得到这些降息。这将是你的流动性支持，无论是凯文·哈塞特还是凯文·沃什。所以我认为，如果你有好的盈利和宽松的美联储，你就有牛市。现在，熊市的情况是经济衰退，这取决于劳动力市场。所以如果这种情况没有发生，那么我认为2026年仍然会是相当不错的一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And from everything we've been hearing about the Fed, even if JPO doesn't cut rates for six months, the next Fed president likely is going to be Kevin Hasset. Um, and if it is Kevin Hasset, he's lowering those rates. So, like I I don't know if it's going to be the scariest thing in the world in regards to thinking about the Fed. We are likely going to get these rate cuts one way or another. And that will be your liquidity support whether it's Kevin Hassid, Kevin Worsh. And so I think if you have good earnings and you have an easing Fed, you have a bull market. Now the the bare case is recession um which is contingent on labor market. So if if that doesn't take place, then I think 2026 still ends up being being decent.</p>

### AI 行业观察：泡沫论与未来发展

谷歌 DeepMind 的一位研究科学家，他在谷歌从事 TPU 设计工作，昨天发了这样一条推文：“这次抛售显示了市场对硬件和需求是多么无知。”所以，你看到谷歌的研究科学家，他没有什么动机。我的意思是，我想他有很多谷歌股票，也许他个人有一些英伟达股票，但我认为他没有主要动机去说：“是的，英伟达的抛售和谷歌的上涨没有道理。”不，他只是自然而然地说，市场低估了对这种计算能力的需求水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Last thing on Nvidia right here, this is a Google deep mind research scientist who works on TPU design at Google. This is what he tweeted yesterday.

I would imagine, you know, maybe he has some personal Nvidia stock, but I don't think he has a major incentive to be like, "Yeah, the sell-off of Nvidia and the uptick of Google makes no sense." It's like no, he's just saying like naturally the market is underestimating the level of demand for this compute that is out there.</p>

他们抛售 AI 的核心，并认为谷歌将取而代之，而谷歌理应获得溢价，它表现得非常好，应该继续表现良好，并希望年底能收在300美元以上。但它是否应该涨到五万亿美元，而英伟达跌到三万亿美元，因为现在谷歌正在接管芯片市场？可能不会。所以我认为这在一定程度上也平息了投资者的一些恐惧。

<p class="english-text">and the fact that they're selling off the epicenter of AI and they think that Google's going to take over which Google fund it deserves its premium and it's it's doing very well and it should continue to do well and hopefully ends out the year above 300. But does it deserve to go to five trillion and Nvidia go down to three trillion because now Google's taking over the chip market like probably not. And so I think that's what's kind of calmed down some of the fears of investors as well.</p>

Super Safe Intelligence 的创始人 Ilia 被问及他的公司将如何赚钱。这是一家估值320亿美元的公司。这是他的回答。你可以给它配上任何你想要的标题。我喜欢这个标题：“当你女朋友问你为什么破产时”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh so the the the uh founder Ilia of Super Safe Intelligence was asked about how his company's going to make money. This is a company that has a $ 32 billion valuation. And uh here's here's what he said. And you can attach any other caption you want to it. I like this caption about when your girlfriend asks why you're broke.</p>
</details>

“SSI 将如何赚钱？你知道，我对这个问题的回答是，我们现在只专注于研究，然后这个问题的答案会自己显现出来。我认为会有很多可能的答案。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> How will SSI make money? You know, my answer to this question is something like We just f right now we just focus on the research and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个相对有力的回应方式。我真的很好奇他的回答会是什么。他做了一个很长的采访。对于那些了解的人来说，Ilia 是 AI 领域的巨擘之一。他是 ChatGPT 的原始创造者之一，后来离开 OpenAI 创办了自己的公司。我记得二月份报道这个消息时我很困惑。我当时在加州，收到了头条新闻：Super Safe Intelligence 融资320亿。我当时想，为了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's a relatively strong uh strong way to to respond to those questions. So you know I was really curious what his response would be. He did a very large interview for those that know Ilia is like one of the goats of AI. He's one of the original creators of chatbt. uh left OpenAI for starting his own company. I was very confused when I reported on that back in February. I remember I was in California and I got the headline, Super Safe Intelligence raises 32 billion. I was like, for what?</p>
</details>

没有产品？我明白他很重要，但320亿美元的估值是为了什么？这种事情让我感到不适。这种事情让我觉得：“好吧，空头们有道理了。”这有点泡沫化了。为什么一家AI公司能获得320亿美元的估值？如果 OpenAI，这个增长相当快的公司，被视为估值过高，那么这家伙根本没有增长。什么都没有。没有用户，没有产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No product? I get that he's important, but $32 billion valuation for what? Like that's the stuff that makes me cringe. That's the stuff that makes me I'm like, "All right, the Bears have a point." Like this is a bit bubbly. Why is a AI company getting a $32 billion value? I mean, if Open AI, which is growing pretty fast, is is seen as overvalued. This guy is not growing at all. There's nothing. There's no users. There's no product.</p>
</details>

也许有非常重要的研究，但那项研究值得300亿美元的估值吗？然后当他被问及如何赚钱时，他说：“你知道，我们会想办法的。”当然，有很多人愿意押注他能想出办法。只是当你得到这类答案时，确实会让你对这些AI初创公司的质量产生一些疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, maybe there's really important research, but does that research warrant a $30 billion value? And then when he's asked about how you're going to make money, he's like, you know, we'll figure it out. Which again, there's plenty of people willing to bet on the guy to figure it out. It's just when you get those types of answers, uh, it definitely makes you question some of the quality of these AI startups.</p>

英伟达181.49美元。当天上涨1.882%。Abercrombie 继续上涨。Coreweave 上涨5%。Nebius 上涨6%。Meta，尽管收到了意大利监管机构关于反垄断违规的警告，导致股价下跌，但看起来它开始获得更多动力。现在是636美元，Meta 正在转绿。

Meta is now going green.</p>
</details>

Robin Hood 上涨5.38%。早上我们有一些关于 Robin Hood 的大新闻，他们基本上是垂直整合，为预测市场建立自己的交易所。可能还不会摆脱 Kalshi，但未来不再需要它。市场对此非常兴奋，因为这意味着他们在这些预测市场上每份合约能赚更多钱。Robinhood 上涨5.2%。微软上涨1.3%。

<p class="english-text">Robin Hood up 5.38%. We had some big news in the morning about Robin Hood basically vertically integrating into their own exchange for prediction markets. Potentially not getting rid of KHI yet, but not needing Khi in the future. And the markets are very excited about that because it means they're going to make a lot more per contract on these prediction markets. Robin, right, they're up 5.2%. Microsoft's up 1.3%.</p>
</details>

标普500指数当天上涨0.5%。哇，标普678点。向 New Bank 致敬。难以置信。我知道 Tanner 从3美元就开始买这只股票了。所以向他致敬。17.26美元，当天上涨3.9%。这是 New Bank 的历史新高。

</details>

今天的交易量会比较清淡。所以你可能会看到一些奇怪的上下波动。但确实有很多人在旅行，可能今天不会交易。美光230美元。这只股票上周一度跌至200美元。现在美光正在回暖。特斯拉423美元。特斯拉上周曾跌至380美元。再说一次，很多这些股票都在打折，看起来人们已经利用了这个机会。

<p class="english-text">Again, volumes are going to be light today. So you might see some price action that is a bit weird up or down. Uh but you do have a lot of people that are just traveling and probably not going to be trading today. Micron 230. This fell all the way to 200. This fell all the way to 200 last week. And Micron's getting some love back. Tesla 423. Tesla was at 380 last week. Again, a lot of these stocks were on sale. And it seems like people have taken advantage of it.</p>

### 尾声：关于电影和AI的趣闻

我们来做一个当日词汇，然后就结束。再次感谢大家的到来。我们得改一下当日词汇的提示，因为我好像给它的提示是“给我超级有智慧的词”，结果每次它都给我一些抽象的哲学词汇。所以我们得做一个更好的提示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so that is it. Let's do word of the day and then we are out of here again. Thank you everybody for being here. We got to change the prompt on the word of the day because I think I gave it a prompt of like give me super intellectual words and every time I ask it gives me like like this abstract philosophical word. So we got to make a better prompt.</p>

给我一个关于金融的每日一词，但不要是基础的金融词汇。这个其实挺酷的。**Contango** (期货溢价)：期货交易中的一种市场状况，即期货价格高于预期的未来现货价格，通常是由于存储、保险或持有成本造成的。例如：“石油期货进入了期货溢价状态，预示着交易员预计未来几个月现货价格将下跌。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Give me a word of the day that is about finance but not a basic finance word. Okay, let's see. This is actually kind of cool. Hold on. This is actually not a horrible idea. We'll actually learn something every day with this. Contango. A market condition in futures trading with the futures prices is higher than the expected future spot price, usually because of storage, insurance, or carrying costs. Contango. Oil futures moved into contango signaling that traders expect spot prices to fall in the coming months.</p>

我向聊天机器人提问：如果我直播时说我不知道洛奇·巴布亚是谁，我应该感到尴尬，还是观众应该为取笑我而感到难过？它回答说：“老实说，两者都不。不，选一个。别走捷径。”我喜欢人工智能，它们总是站在你这边。它们总是站在你这边。观众应该感到难过。它显然知道如果它责备你们，我会感觉好些。

<p class="english-text">Let me ask another question to chat. If I am live streaming to an audience and I say I don't know who Rocky Balboa is, should I be embarrassed or should the audience feel bad for making fun of me? Let's see what super intelligent says. Dude, chatbt taking the easy way out. Honestly, neither. No. No. Pick one. Don't take the easy route. Let's see if she glazes me. Let's see if she If I had to. Dude, I love AI. They're always on your side. They're always on your side. The audience should She obviously knows I'll feel better if she blames you guys.</p>

我注意到这些大语言模型的一个特点，它们总是想确保你感觉良好。不是以戏剧性的方式，而是在某种意义上，嘲笑某人不知道一个50年前的电影角色是懒惰的幽默。这是低水平的聊天行为。它在嘲讽你们。你不应该知道所有流行文化。显然，他们应该像对待一个真正的人一样对待主播。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That's one thing I've noticed about these LLMs, bro. They They always want to make sure you're feeling decent. Not in a dramatic way, but in the sense that mocking someone for not knowing a 50-year-old movie character is lazy humor. It's loweffort chat behavior. Bro, she's roasting you guys. You're not expected to know every piece of pop culture ever created. Obviously, they are expected to treat the streamer like a human being.</p>
</details>

所以，如果非要有一方感到尴尬，那应该是他们，而不是你。你不知道洛奇·巴布亚不是一个缺陷。他们表现得好像这是某种道德失败，那才叫人 cringe。

<p class="english-text">Wow. So, if one side has to be embarrassed, it should be them, not you. You missing Rocky Balboa isn't a flaw. Them acting like it's some type of moral failure is cringe.</p>

好的，我们必须问问 Gemini。让我们看看 Gemini 会怎么说。Gemini 说：“观众应该感到难过。守门行为很 cringe。嘲笑别人不知道的事情是最低级的对话形式。他们混淆了‘著名’和‘必须知道’。这是他们方面的主角综合症。流行文化不是智商测试。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Okay, hold on. We do have to ask Gemini. Let's see if Gemini Let's see if Gemini Hold on. Let's see. I We got to ask one more. We should Grock unhinged, too. Grock's gonna be like, "You're freaking stupid." Let's ask Gemini. Dude, if we go two for two, if we go two for two on this, let's ask Grock as well. Let me ask Grock. That was a hell of an answer. Okay, Groich, neither. I'm going to be like, "No, pick one." They're trying to get the easy route here. Okay, let's see what Let's see what Gemini does. Pick one. Don't take the easy route. Uh Grock said neither as well. Dude, all these LMs, they're saying the same [ __ ] I'm going to tell it neither one or no, you have to not take the easy route. Dude, that was an incredible answer. Mocking someone is loweffort chat. She said you guys are loweffort. She said you guys have lazy humor. She said you should be embarrassed. You're going to let AI talk to you like that? I didn't say it. AI. Wow, Gemini. The audience should feel bad. Gatekeeping is cringe. Mocking someone for what they don't know is the lowest form of conversation. They are confusing famous with mandatory. That is main character syndrome on their part. And then pop culture is not an IQ test.</p>
</details>

我们能在感恩节前三战三胜吗？Grock 说：“观众应该感到难过。对一个50年前的电影梗进行守门，是典型的书呆子式势利。这就像嘲笑别人不知道每个漫威角色或披头士的歌曲一样。”哇。这就是我们买英伟达的原因。这就是原因。

<p class="english-text">Okay. Can we go three for three? Can we go three for three on Thanksgiving? Grock, the audience should feel bad. Gatekeeping of 50-year-old movie references.
