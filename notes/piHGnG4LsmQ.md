### 创作者的起点与初心

我是否要退休了？这正是我将在本视频中回答的问题。如果你赶时间，可以直接跳到答案，但我认为先听我解释会更有意义。你们知道，我在 2011 年辞去了全职工作后，创办了这个 **YouTube** 频道。当时我每周大约教 15 个小时的课来维持生计。而其余 40 到 50 个小时，我则投入到这个频道制作视频中，我做这一切并非为了钱。我想，当时任何开始做这件事的人都不是为了钱，因为那时几乎赚不到什么钱。我全职工作的第一年，收入是 840 美元。第二年，我赚了 12,000 美元。我创建 Veritasium 的真正原因，是因为它让我能够结合我一直最热爱的三件事：学习科学知识、教学，以及创造——比如表演和制作视频。我并非为了创业而进入这个领域。我个人认为我非常不擅长推销东西，我不是那种会说“你一定要试试这个，它会改变你的人生”的人。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
Am I retiring? That is the question I will answer in this video, and you can skip ahead to the answer if you like, but I think it'll make more sense if I explain. You know, I started this YouTube channel in 2011 after quitting my full-time job. I was teaching around 15 hours a week to pay the bills. But the other 40 to 50 hours per week, I spent making videos on this channel, and I didn't do it for the money. I don't think anyone who started at that time did, because there was basically no money to be made. In my first year working full time, I made $840. In my second year, I earned $12,000. The real reason I made Veritasium is because it allowed me to combine the three things that I always loved doing the most, learning about science, teaching, and creating, like performing and making videos. I did not get into this to start a business. I personally think I'd be terrible at selling things. I'm not one of those people who can say, "You've gotta try this. It'll change your life."

### 坚持原则与价值传递

你知道，早在 2015 年，我曾发起了一个名为 **Snatoms** 的磁性分子建模套件的众筹项目，至今仍在亚马逊上销售，但我几乎从不提及它，因为我不想打扰你们。我猜想，如果你需要这样的东西，也许会自己找到。我几乎从不请求你们点赞、评论或订阅。我只想感谢你们观看。因为我认为你们知道自己想要什么。我不是那种“增长黑客”。我们不卖廉价的周边商品，没有 T 恤或连帽衫。我希望你们从我这里获得的价值，比我从你们那里获得的价值更多。你知道，我真正热衷的唯一一件事就是**真理**，而探求真理的最佳途径就是通过科学。我们的宇宙是一个非凡的地方，我认为大多数人一生都浑然不觉它是如何运转的。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
You know, back in 2015, I kickstarted a magnetic molecular modeling kit called Snatoms, and I still sell it on Amazon, but I hardly ever mention it because I don't wanna bother you. And I figure if you're looking for something like that, well maybe, you'll find it. I almost never ask you to like, comment, or subscribe. I wanna thank you for watching. Because I figure you know what you wanna do. And I'm not a growth hacker. We don't sell cheap merch, no t-shirts or hoodies. I want you to get more value outta me than I get out of you. You know, the only thing that I am really passionate about is the truth, and the best way to get to the truth is through science. Our universe is an extraordinary place, and I think most people go through life oblivious to how it actually works.

### 科学的负面后果与批判性思维

“船为什么能前进？”——“嗯，我不知道，我确实不知道，但我知道它能。” 但我确实不拥有所有答案。我认为这不仅仅是遗憾，它会带来真实的负面后果。举个例子，1958 年，**Dr. Benjamin Spock** 在他的著作《**《Baby and Child Care》**》中写道，婴儿应该趴着睡，而不是仰着睡，以防止他们被自己的呕吐物呛到。这本书在其 52 年的印刷期内，销量超过了除《圣经》以外的所有书籍。所以，它极具影响力。但当经验性研究表明，趴着睡的婴儿实际上更有可能死于**婴儿猝死综合征**（Sudden Infant Death Syndrome），这本书并没有及时更新。它几十年来都印着同样的错误建议，导致了估计 **50,000 例**不必要的死亡。关键在于，我们的生活会更美好、更快乐，当它与世界的实际运作方式相符，而不是仅仅符合我们表面的认知或我们希望的样子。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
How does the boat go forwards? - Yeah, escape that. Well again, well, I know, I know it does but again, I don't have all the answers. - I think that's not just unfortunate. It has real negative consequences. To give an example, in 1958, Dr. Benjamin Spock published in his book, "Baby and Child Care," that babies should be put down to sleep on their fronts rather than their backs to prevent them from choking on their own vomit. And this book outsold every other book, except the Bible, for its 52 year print run. So, it was pretty influential. But when empirical studies showed that babies sleeping on their fronts were actually more likely to die from sudden infant death syndrome, well, the book was not promptly updated. It was printed with the same bad advice for decades, leading to an estimated 50,000 unnecessary deaths. The point is we lead better and happier lives when they're in accordance with how the world actually is, rather than just how it appears to be or how we'd like it to be.
</details>

### Veritasium 的核心使命

这就是为什么每段视频的潜在主旨都是：我们如何知道什么是真实的？我们如何知道自己是否错了？因为我想提升**批判性思维**的水平。这正是 **Veritasium** 的根本使命。到 2013 年，我足够幸运，这个梦想中的工作——**YouTube** 频道——开始产生足够的收入让我维持生计。于是我辞去了所有其他工作，从那时起，这便成了我的主业。我真不敢相信我能做这么多事情，我想感谢你们，感谢每一位观看过我至少一个视频的人，是你们让这一切成为可能。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
That is why an undercurrent of every video is how do we know what's true, how would we know if we were wrong, because I want to increase the level of critical thinking in the world. That is the fundamental mission of Veritasium. Now so far, this is basically just like- By 2013, I was fortunate enough that this dream job YouTube channel started to produce enough income to live off. So I quit all other work, and this has been my main gig ever since. I can't believe all the things I've gotten to do, and I want to thank you, someone who's watched at least one of these videos, for making it possible.

### 创作者的生存焦虑

但我必须承认我最大的恐惧，以及我认为任何创作者面临的最大挑战，那就是**不确定性**（precariousness）。这是一份充满不确定性的工作。我的意思是，你每个月能赚多少钱，取决于你频道那个月获得了多少观看量。然后，还有评论区，以及你的自我价值感基本上与你的视频受欢迎程度挂钩的事实。但迄今为止，最大的不确定性来源，就是不知道这一切何时会结束，比如你何时会上传最后一个成功的视频，何时将不再能靠你一直在做的事情谋生。2018 年，我接到 **YouTube** 联系人的电话，他告诉我需要“保持相关性”。是的，这话有点伤人。我不会点名，但我见过许多朋友和其他创作者，因为各种原因停止创作，比如他们可能受伤或生了重病。我知道其他 **YouTuber** 被“取消”或被取消盈利。我的意思是，事情出错的方式有上百万种，而能继续顺利发展的方式却只有一种。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
But I have to acknowledge my biggest fear and what I think is the biggest challenge facing any creator, which is precariousness. This is a job that comes with a lot of uncertainty. I mean, how much you make in any given month depends on how many views your channel got in that month. And then, there's the comment section and the fact that your sense of self worth is basically tied to how well your videos are received. But by far, the biggest source of uncertainty is just not knowing when this is all going to end, like when are you going to upload your last successful video, when are you no longer going to be able to make a living doing what you have been doing. In 2018, I had a call with my contact at YouTube who told me I needed to quote, "Stay relevant." Yeah, that stung a bit. Now, I'm not gonna name names, but I have seen friends and other creators who have stopped making stuff for a whole bunch of reasons, like maybe they've gotten injured or gotten really sick. I know of other YouTubers who've been canceled or demonetized. I mean, there's just a million ways for things to go wrong and only really one way for them to continue to go right.
</details>

### 应对不确定性与早期实践

我认为最可怕的可能性是，**YouTube 算法**突然停止向人们展示你的视频。我认为这是最可怕的，因为它太普遍了，而且完全超出你的控制。我应对这种不确定性的方式是限制我的开销。我不会购买任何不必要的设备。我不会预订去拍摄地的差旅。但如果有人邀请我过去，我可能会顺便拍摄。我做了所有的研究、写作、拍摄和剪辑工作。即使是那些粗糙的动画，是的，那都是我做的。只要投入的是我的时间和对这个频道的依赖来维持生计，我就觉得没问题。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
I think by far the scariest proposition is that the YouTube algorithm just stops showing your videos to people. I think that's the scariest, because it is so common and it's completely out of your control. The way I dealt with this precariousness was by limiting my expenses. I didn't buy any more equipment than was strictly necessary. I didn't book travel to filming locations. But if someone else was flying me out, I might try to tag on a shoot. I did all the research, writing, filming, and editing myself. Even the crappy animations, yes, all of that was me. As long as it was just my time going into this channel and me depending on it for survival, I was okay.
</details>

### 规模化扩张与招聘挑战

当我 2016 年有了第一个孩子时，我推出了 **Patreon**，试图确保我能永远照顾我的家人。但频道持续增长，规模大到我仍然独自一人包揽一切变得有些可笑。我一直在工作。我可能是你遇到的最慢的剪辑师，所以我本该雇一个剪辑师，但招聘需要时间。有多少天招聘某人是我优先列表的顶端？零，因为我总是专注于制作下一个视频。我确实最终开始雇人，但不是因为我在主动寻找他们，而是因为他们找到了我。我认识的第一个长期合作的人是 Jonny Hyman。我找到他，仅仅是因为他在一家 Chipotle 餐厅认出了我。他才华横溢，为这个频道做了研究和写作，还负责剪辑、视觉特效和制作模拟。他甚至为视频创作和制作了原创音乐，你现在听到的就是其中一部分。我雇佣 Petr Lebedev，是因为他曾在我以前的博士导师手下读博。我在 Zoom 电话开始 20 分钟后就雇佣了 Emily Zang，并让她搬到另一个州。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
When I had my first kid in 2016, I launched a Patreon to try to ensure that I could always take care of my family, but the channel continued to grow. It grew to a size where it was ridiculous that I was still doing everything myself. I was working all the time. I am perhaps the slowest editor you will ever meet, so I should have hired an editor, but hiring takes time. And on how many days was hiring someone at the top of my priority list? Well, zero, because I was always focused on making that next video. Now, I did eventually start hiring people, but not because I was looking for them, just because they found me. I mean, the first person I worked with consistently was Jonny Hyman. And I only found him because he recognized me in a Chipotle. He is ridiculously talented. He's researched and written for this channel, plus he's edited, done VFX, made simulations. He's even written and produced music, original music for videos, and you're listening to some of it right now. I hired Petr Lebedev because he did a PhD with my old PhD supervisor.
</details>

### 团队协作的初期尝试

我雇佣 Emily Zang 是在一次 Zoom 通话开始 20 分钟后，并告诉她搬到全国去。我通过朋友 Xyla Foxlin 了解到你。我记得你给我发了条短信，我说：“天哪，Derek Muller 在给我发短信。”我说：“天哪，Veritasium，Muller 先生在给我发短信。”然后你说：“你今天晚些时候能接个 FaceTime 吗？”我说：“嗯，这面试流程有点不一样。”——我们聊了半小时。——“然后我说，你想和我一起工作吗？你想来洛杉矶一起工作吗？”——“我想，可以。多久？”——“你当时说，‘尽快’。”我主动在招聘网站上寻找的唯一一个人是我的剪辑师 Trenton。我的两位主要动画师 Ivy 和 Fabio，是通过冷邮件找到的。我说：“你在找能做出色动画的人吗？”你说“是”。Ivy 发给我一封邮件说：“我看过你的动画，我觉得我能做得更好。”“你的动画——”我当时有点冒犯，但我也想：“好吧，如果你觉得你能做得更好，那就展示一下。”我们还通过冷邮件找到了第一位实习生 Casper。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
I hired Emily Zang 20 minutes into a Zoom call and told her to move across the country. I found out about you through a friend, Xyla Foxlin. - I remember I just got a text from you and I was like, "Oh my god, Derek Muller was texting me." I be like, "Oh my God, Veritasium, Mr. Veritasium was texting me," and you were just like, "Can you hop on a FaceTime later today?" And I was like, "Well, this is a different interview process." - We talked for half an hour. - Yeah. - And then I said, "Do you wanna work with me? Do you wanna fly to LA and like work together?" - And I was like, "I guess. In how soon?" And you were like, "As soon as you physically can." - The only person I actively sought out on a job board was my editor, Trenton. My two main animators, Ivy and Fabio, I got through cold emails. What did you say? - I said, "Are you looking for someone to have good animations?" And you said yes, you were. - Ivy sent me an email saying, "I've seen your animations and I think I can do better." "Your animations-" - I wasn't so straightforward. - "Aren't the best." I was like slightly offended reading the email, but I was also like, "Well, if you think you can do better, let's see it." We also got our first intern, Casper, through a cold email.

### 增长的悖论与不可持续性

总而言之，我不太擅长寻找人才。但如果他们找到我并且看起来不错，我很乐意给他们一个机会。到 2021 年，我拥有了一个由作家、制片人、动画师和剪辑师组成的才华横溢的小团队。所以你可能会认为我可以把任务委托给他们，从而减少工作时间，但实际发生的是相反的情况。我工作的时间比以往任何时候都长，因为我必须为他们准备要做的事情，并且要培训他们。我仍然负责剪辑大约一半的视频，而对于另一半，我经常会在深夜开车穿越洛杉矶，去取我剪辑师的硬盘，因为这是我们找到的最快的数据传输方式。然后我会开车回家，上传文件，并在早上 6 点前发布视频。那一年我熬过的通宵比我生命中的任何一年都要多，包括大学时期。许多夜晚，我没有去哄孩子们睡觉，而是在楼下的办公室为这个频道制作视频。所以，那时我的未婚妻告诉我一件我早已知道的事情：这**不可持续**。是的，她当时还是我的未婚妻，因为尽管我们七年前就订婚了，并育有三个孩子，但我们一直没找到时间举办婚礼。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
In short, I wasn't very good at finding people. But if they found me and seemed decent, then I was happy to give them a shot. By 2021, I had this talented little team of writer, producers, animators, and an editor. So you might think that I could delegate tasks to them and work fewer hours, but what actually happened was the opposite. I was working more than than ever before because I had to prepare things for them to do and I had to train them up. You know, I was still editing about half of the videos, and for the other half, I would often drive across Los Angeles in the middle of the night to pick up a hard drive from my editor, because this is the fastest method of data transfer that we worked out. And then I would drive back home, upload the file, and launch the video by 6:00 AM. I pulled more all-nighters that year than any other year of my life, including university. There were many nights where instead of tucking my kids into bed, I was downstairs in the office making videos for this channel. So, that is when my fiance told me something that I already knew, which was that this was not sustainable. And yes, she was still my fiance because even though we got engaged seven years previous and had three kids together, we hadn't found the time to have a wedding.
</details>

### Electrify 的投资与战略转型

因此，时机恰好在 2022 年，这两个人——Owen 和 Ian——主动找到我，谈论投资 Veritasium。他们创办了一家名为 **Electrify** 的公司，其明确目标是帮助教育类创作者建立更好的业务并实现**工作与生活的平衡**。我们非常喜爱 Veritasium 在过去大约 13 年里所做的一切。我们只想让它继续下去，做得更多，做得更好。他们给我的交易是这样的：他们会收购部分业务，但我会保留所有权。他们将负责处理招聘、制作、后勤、公司合规、税务等事务。并且他们会减少我的工作时间。所以，这可以说是恰在完美时机提出的完美提议。我从不想处理招聘、税务以及所有这些杂事。我只想做视频，你知道吗？就像，一直以来都是这样。学习科学，制作一个很棒的视频。此外，他们为股权支付的预付款，将能减轻作为创作者的**不确定性**，尤其是在 **AI** 兴起和短视频刚刚起步的时期。当时存在比平时更大的不确定性。这将使我能够始终为我的家人提供保障，最重要的是，通过减少工作时间，我将有更多时间陪伴他们。所以，这简直是明智之举。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
So the timing was kind of perfect when in 2022, these two guys, Owen and Ian, approached me about investing in Veritasium. They had started a company called Electrify, with the stated aim of helping educational creators build better businesses and achieve work-life balance. We loved Veritasium for what it had been doing for I guess 13 years at that point. And we just wanna keep that going and do more and even more of that great stuff. So the deal they offered me was this. They would buy some of the business, but I would remain an owner. They would take care of things like hiring, production, logistics, you know, corporate compliance, taxes, all that sort of stuff. And they would reduce my working hours. So, it was kind of the perfect offer at the perfect time. I never wanted to deal with hiring, and taxes, and all that stuff. I just wanted to make videos, you know? Like that's always what it's been about. Learn about science, make a great video. Plus with the cash they would pay up front for equity, well, that would reduce the precariousness of being a creator, especially at a time when AI was coming on the scenes and shorts were just starting. There was a lot more uncertainty than usual. And this would allow me to always be able to provide for my family, which most importantly, with fewer working hours, I would have a lot more time to spend. So, it was kind of a no brainer.
</details>

### 合作成果与质量保证

我在 2023 年 4 月签署了协议，从那时起，Veritasium 就由我和 Electrify 共同拥有和运营。现在，我看到一些评论担心这次投资会影响频道，我完全理解。我的意思是，他们会削减成本，降低视频质量，然后为了提高短期利润而大量制作视频吗？但幸运的是，你无需猜测 Electrify 会做什么，因为我们已经合作了将近三年。所以，我可以向你展示我们所做的一切。我们制作了一些频道历史上最成功的视频。事实上，你们集体观看时间最长的三个视频都是在这个时期制作的：关于永久化学品、蓝色 LED 以及黑洞、白洞和虫洞的视频。像这样的视频稳步增加了人们观看 Veritasium 的时间。事实上，过去四个月，人们观看该频道的总时长创下了纪录。自交易以来，频道订阅者数量增加了 50%。这些成果并非仅仅通过增加视频数量来实现的。事实上，主频道视频的数量基本保持不变。我们也**没有**试图制作更短的视频。我们继续深入探讨复杂的科学主题。因此，视频的时长也在持续增加。但这只是在 Electrify 之前就开始的趋势。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
I signed the deal in April, 2023, and since then, Veritasium has been owned and run by me and Electrify. Now, I've seen some comments concerned with how the investment will affect the channel, which I totally get. I mean, would they cut costs, reduce the video quality, and just pump out way more videos to boost short-term profits? But fortunately, you don't have to wonder what Electrify will do, because we've already been working together for nearly three years. So, I can show you what we have done. We have produced some of the most successful videos in the channel's history. In fact, the three videos you collectively have spent the most time watching were all produced in this period. The videos on forever chemicals, blue LEDs, and black holes, white holes, and wormholes. Videos like these have steadily increased the amount of time that people are spending watching Veritasium. In fact, the last four months have seen a record amount of time that people are spending watching the channel. Since the deal, the number of subscribers on the channel has increased by 50%. These results have not been achieved by simply pumping out more videos. In fact, the number of main channel videos has remained basically constant. We've also not tried to make shorter videos. We've continued to do deep dives into complex scientific topics. And because of that, the length of videos has continued to increase. But that's a trend that began before Electrify.
</details>

### 团队壮大与能力拓展

我们真正实现增长的方式是增加人手。现在有超过 30 人在 Veritasium 工作：作家、导演、研究员、插画师、动画师、剪辑师和制作人员。这些人负责制作了你们许多喜爱的视频。我与 Gregor 合作制作了关于 Teflon、PFAS 和 Monsanto 的深度报道；与 Casper 合作制作了关于熵、最小作用量原理系列以及黑洞、白洞和虫洞的视频；与 Emily 合作制作了蓝色 LED 和微型鼠比赛视频；Henry 负责了关于 Alfred Nobel 和手机黑客的视频；Sulli 探索了 Citycorp Tower 的建造、超级胶水以及 Amelia Earhart 的遭遇；Petr 撰写并执导了关于 Oppenheimer 和日本刀的视频；Emilia 则负责了喷气发动机和锂离子电池的视频；James 制作了关于幂律和六度分隔的视频。我还可以继续列举，但重点是，**远非削减成本，在 Electrify 的支持下，开支翻了四倍**。大部分都花在了团队身上。我们遍布世界各地，但每年会聚在一起几次，交流并思考如何改进。当你看到一个精美的动画场景时，它并非来自 AI。那是**手工绘制**的，也是**人工动画**的。我们视频的**故事板**制作现在非常专业，就像电影工作室一样。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
The real way we've been able to grow is by adding more people. There are now over 30 people working on Veritasium, writer, directors, researchers, illustrators, animators, editors, and production staff. These are the people responsible for some of your favorite videos. I worked with Gregor to make the exposes on Teflon, and PFAS, and Monsanto, with Casper to make entropy, the principle of lease action series, and black holes, white holes, and wormhole. With Emily, we made blue LEDs and the micromouse competition video. Henry was responsible for the videos on Alfred Nobel and phone hacking. Sulli explored the construction of the Citycorp Tower, super glue, and what happened to Amelia Earhart. Petr wrote and directed the videos on Oppenheimer and Japanese swords. Emilia did the same for jet engines and lithium ion batteries. James made the videos on power laws and six degrees of separation. I could go on, but the point is far from cutting costs, under Electrify, expenses have quadrupled. Most of that goes to the team. We are all spread around the world, but we come together a few times a year to connect and figure out how to improve. When you see a beautifully animated scene, it's not AI. That was drawn by hand by a person and animated by a person too. The way our videos are storyboarded now, it's so professional. It's like a movie studio.
</details>

### 拓展平台与多媒体内容

我们还有其他方面的支持。像 PFAS 或 Monsanto 这样的视频可能会惹恼大公司。所以我们现在能够制作这些视频，是因为我们有**法律团队**提供专业建议。你可以把内容提交给法务团队，看看是否允许我们这样说。这极大地扩展了我们的能力。你知道，提升**批判性思维**的宏大目标，单凭我一人，几乎完全是通过制作 YouTube 视频来完成的。我没有时间或精力做其他事情。但有了更多的人和资源，我们拓展了方法。我们现在定期在 **TikTok** 和 **Instagram** 上发布视频，并且制作 **YouTube Shorts** 的原创内容。我们已将最成功的视频翻译成印度尼西亚语、泰语、越南语、阿拉伯语和土耳其语等语言，并维护着其他语言的专属频道。每周我们都会发布一份免费的科学通讯。我们还发起了一个科学问答桌游，获得了超过 11,000 名支持者。播客和其他频道的项目也正在进行中。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
And we have people supporting us in other ways too. Videos like PFAS or Monsanto might make big companies mad at us. So we've only been able to make those videos now, because we have access to a legal team who can properly advise us. You can run things past the legal team, but just see like, are we allowed to say this? So I mean, it just, it's expanded our capability. You know, the goal of improving the level of critical thinking in the world is a big one, but on my own, I tackled it almost exclusively by making YouTube videos. I didn't have the time or bandwidth for anything else. But with more people and resources, we have expanded our approach. We're now launching videos regularly on TikTok and Instagram, and we're making original Shorts for YouTube. We have dubbed our most successful videos into languages like Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Turkish, in addition to maintaining dedicated channels in other languages. Every week we are publishing a free science newsletter. And we just kickstarted a science trivia board game with over 11,000 backers. Other projects like podcasts and additional channels are in the works.
</details>

### 严谨的内容制作流程

当然，其中一些项目可能不吸引你，这没关系，但我希望你同意我的观点：世界需要更多严谨制作的科学内容。你知道，我们所有的**事实都会经过内部核查**，并且我们**每期视频都会咨询多位专家**。我们会将内容交由他们审阅，以确保我们准确无误。我们还会将早期版本发布给我们的 **Patreon** 支持者，他们慷慨地帮助我们发现错误。如果我们搞错了，我知道这种情况会发生，请务必告知我们。我欢迎你们的建设性批评。我希望你们帮助我们改进。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
Now, some of these things may not appeal to you, and that's fine, but I hope you agree with me that the world is better off with more rigorously produced science content. You know, all our facts are checked internally, and we also use multiple experts with every video. We run it past them to make sure we get everything right. We also post early versions to our Patreon supporters who graciously help us catch mistakes. If we ever mess up, and I know it happens, well please let us know. I welcome your constructive criticism. I want you to help us improve.
</details>

### 个人生活与退休的答案

至于我个人，我已经能够减少工作量，花更多时间陪伴我的四个孩子。今年夏天，我们游览了亚速尔群岛、冰岛，在阿姆斯特丹骑行，并拜访了我在温哥华的家人。就在上个月，我终于在葡萄牙与我聪明、美丽的妻子结婚了。我无法找到比她更好、更有耐心的伴侣共度余生。那么，我是在退休吗？嗯，总有一天我会的，但具体何时还不确定。我可以告诉你的是，我不会像以前那样经常出现，这可能在过去一两年里你们已经有所察觉。在一些即将发布的视频中，我可能完全不会出现，即使我在幕后指导。这是为了给我更多时间陪伴家人，阅读书籍，锻炼身体，并思考其他项目。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
As for me, I have been able to reduce my workload and spend more time with my now four kids. This summer, we traveled around the Azores, Iceland, biked around Amsterdam, and visited my family in Vancouver. And just last month, I finally got married to my brilliant, beautiful wife here in Portugal. I could not have picked a better or more patient partner with whom to spend the rest of my life. So, am I retiring? Well, at some point I will, but it's not exactly clear when that will be. What I can tell you is that I won't be around as much, which you've probably already gathered over the last year or two. You know, in some upcoming videos, I will not appear at all, even if I'm guiding things in the background. And this is to give me more time to spend with my family and to read books, and exercise, and contemplate other projects.
</details>

### 团队的力量与未来展望

我为我最初的**激情项目**如今雇佣了数十人而感到自豪。我从团队中的每一个人身上都获得了启发，并且对他们的能力有着极大的信心。他们获得了优厚的报酬，并且产出了优秀的作品。在我们的一次会议上，我走进一个房间，看到所有这些超级聪明的人都在践行提升**批判性思维**的使命。那一刻我意识到，我不再是孤军奋战了。不再是只有一个家伙在推一块巨石上山。现在，这个团队就像一个**巨型战车**（juggernaut）。他们就像一列呼啸而过的火车，拥有自己的动力。所以，我真心迫不及待地想看看我们能一起取得什么成就。希望你们加入我们。如果你有任何关于频道的问题或想法，请在评论区留言。一如既往，感谢观看。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
You know, I am proud that what started as my passion project, now employs dozens of people. I am inspired by each and every one of them, and I have the utmost confidence in their abilities. You know, they're paid well and they produce excellent work. At one of our meetings, I walked into this room to see all these super intelligent people who have taken up the mission of increasing the level of critical thinking in the world. And that's when it hit me that I am no longer doing this alone. It's no longer just one guy pushing a boulder uphill. Now, the team is like a juggernaut. They're like this train barreling down the tracks with their own momentum. So, I genuinely can't wait to see what we're able to accomplish together. I hope you'll join us.
