### 价值观、临在与无畏

史蒂夫·斯托特（Steve Stoute），《The Tanning of America》一书的作者，**UnitedMasters**的创始人，以及创意解决方案公司**Translation**的领导者，深入探讨了构建公司的核心要素。他指出，大多数公司都拥有由CEO或创始人设定的核心使命与价值观，这些构成了企业的**DNA**。这些DNA决定了公司如何吸引人才、设定期望以及驱动野心。如果缺乏这些关键要素作为公司运作的框架，就可能吸引错误的团队，并迷失前进的“**北极星**”——即公司的最终目标。斯托特强调，这是CEO的首要责任。

关于如何确立这些价值观，他建议从所有认为重要的事物中，提炼出最重要的五到七项，并确保每位员工都能深刻理解并践行这些原则，以此作为公司运作的指导方针，从而形成一种共享的理解。

他提出的第一个核心原则是“**getting on the plane**”（亲自到场）。在创业初期，当需要说服他人或推动项目进展时，他认为亲自前往与对方进行面对面对话至关重要。即使只是短暂的15分钟或半小时的交流，这种**物理临在**（physical presence）所传达的重视程度，能够极大地影响他人的尊重与欣赏。斯托特坦言，尽管这在许多人看来可能显得“极端”，但这种做法已成为他职业生涯中的一个重要**差异制造者**（difference maker）。它不仅表明了他对所谈论内容的重视，也彰显了他对建立真实连接的渴望。这种努力甚至可能帮助那些原本不那么出色的想法走得更远，因为它促成了有意义的对话，并可能将其转化为实际行动。在大多数情况下，它还能帮助一个好想法脱颖而出，优先于另一个同样优秀但来自他人的想法，仅仅因为他付出了“亲自到场”的努力。这是他在公司发展过程中早期学到的一个关键价值。

在确立了公司的核心价值观和通过“亲自到场”来强化连接后，领导者还需要掌握如何处理组织内部的复杂性，其中冲突扮演着至关重要的角色。斯托特认为，**冲突对成功至关重要**（Conflict is critical to success）。他表示，一个能够以积极方式、无缝处理冲突的组织，必然是一支获胜的团队。接受冲突的必然性，并主动迎向冲突，是公司价值观的重要组成部分。他强调，在自己的组织中，他不希望员工认为冲突是负面的或与表现不佳相关。相反，他希望员工明白，当两个**高绩效**（high performing）的个体，拥有共同目标但看待问题的方式不同时，冲突便会产生——而这通常源于对**完美**（perfection）、**成功**（success）、**野心**（ambition）和**成长**（growth）的追求。

在组织中，冲突是宝贵的，因为它能带来多角度的洞察。无论是关于营销计划的成败、产品颜色的选择、命名策略，还是确定最能带来成功的优先事项，或是从多位候选人中选拔人才，听取两到五种不同的视角都至关重要。关键在于，当以**公司整体利益**为中心，并去除个人立场时，即使存在分歧，也能找到最佳方案。这使得领导者能够在不失尊重的**前提下**挑战他人。因此，将冲突视为通往公司更优结果的积极途径，对领导者而言至关重要。冲突本身并非负面词汇，而是处理冲突的方式决定了它的性质。

此外，**无畏精神**（Being fearless）极大地帮助了斯托特。他指出，领导者必须以身作则。如果希望团队无畏，领导者自身必须展现出无畏的领导力。他回顾自己的职业生涯，特别是与**Carol's Daughter**的创业经历。尽管他对美容行业一无所知，但他看到了一个可以解决的问题。无畏之处在于敢于进入一个不熟悉的领域并解决问题，即使不完全理解该行业的方方面面。对他而言，无畏意味着不害怕因不了解行业而可能面临的失败。他拥抱未知，以开放的心态和极大的接纳度去面对，相信这一切的结合将带来伟大的成果。他鼓励人们认识到自己所不知道的，拥抱未知，并在说出“我不知道”时找到喜悦和自由。学习未知将发展出必要的**肌肉记忆**（muscle memory），将无畏转化为行动。虽然并非所有事情都适合无畏，但在追逐梦想和野心的过程中，它无疑是至关重要的。

<summary>Original English</summary>
I am Steve Stoute, author of the book, "The
Tanning of America," founder
of UnitedMasters,
as well as creative solutions
company, Translation.
So when we talk about building a company,
most companies
have core missions and values
that the CEO or the founder has that's
going to be the DNA of the company. It leads
to how you — the kind of people you hire,
your expectations,
your ambition.
It's the things that's most important that
if you don't have those ingredients,
if those aren't the framework in which the
company operates in,
then you're going to attract the wrong
talent, and you're going to lose sort of your North
Star — what you're trying to obtain. And I
think that that is the CEO's
responsibility.
How you go about coming up with these
values: out of all the things that you feel are
important, what are the top five, six — I
would say no more than seven things —
that you need every employee to fully
understand and embrace,
and use that as the guiding principles
on how you operate. And everyone has that
shared understanding.
I'll start with our first one, which is
getting on the plane.
What do I mean by getting on
the plane?
When I first started building the
business, there was this opportunity where you
could, like, call somebody
and, like,
pitch them the idea or try to move them
from point a to point b.
And for me, I thought it was very
important and that people respected
and appreciated
the idea that you will actually get on the
plane to come see them to have that
dialogue,
even if it was 15 minutes, a half
hour. And I know that seems extreme to many,
but I can't tell you how much of a
difference maker it's been in my career, the fact
that I was able and I prioritize
physical presence
in order to show you: a. how much I cared
about what I was saying,
and how much I cared about the importance
of
us connecting
in a real way. And that effort,
it may have helped ideas that weren't
as great
go further
because,
it led to a dialogue that turned into
something else. And in most times, it
helped an idea that was already good
be prioritized over another idea that
could have been as good that came from
somebody else because I actually did
the work
to get on the plane. That is one of the
values that I learned early on as a
difference maker as I was building
the company.
Conflict is critical to success.
You show me an organization
that seamlessly gets through conflict
in a positive way, and I'll show you a
winning team. Accepting that there's going to be
conflict
and running towards that conflict
as part of the values of the company,
for me, I think is important. Because in
my organization, I don't want people to
think that I think that conflict
is something that's
a bad thing
or
an aspect
of poor performance.
I want people to know conflict
comes
when two people who are high performing
have the same goal, but see it going at it
two different ways with the right intent:
perfection,
success,
ambition, growth. In an organization, you
want conflict
because you want to hear two, three, four,
five different perspectives
on why
that marketing plan will succeed or
fail, or why the product
color should be that color versus that
color, or why we should name it this, or what
the priorities are
that's going to lead to the most success,
or
there's four candidates. Which one should
we hire? If you put the company at the
center
and you remove yourself, and what's the
best idea for the company,
regardless of
the fact that you guys may disagree?
It allows you to think through, I can
challenge this person
as long as I am not disrespecting them
while I challenge them. So
framing conflict
as something that could be positive
towards a better outcome for the company
when you walk in the door as a leader,
to me, is important. Conflict is not a
bad word.
How you deal with conflict can make it a
bad word.
Being fearless helped me
tremendously throughout my career. The
first thing you can do is lead by example. If
you want a team of people to be fearless,
obviously, you as a leader have to be
fearless, and they have to see
what fearless leadership looks like. So
when I go throughout my career,
you take it back to starting a
beauty company
with Carol's Daughter, a beauty company
that, you know, we ended up building and
selling to L'Oreal at one point. I
didn't know anything about the beauty
business. But what I did know is there was
a problem there that I could solve.
And the fearless part was being able to
say, "I can go into
this area
and solve a problem
even though I don't understand
all of the elements of the beauty business
itself." That's for me what fearless has
been for me in business. Like, not being
afraid of the failure that seems
imminent because you don't know the
industry itself. Not being afraid
of what you don't know, but knowing that
you're willing to go into it with a big,
open heart and a wealth of
acceptance
of what you don't know,
and all of that stuff coming together
would lead to a better — would lead to a
great outcome. Know what you don't know.
Embrace what you don't know.
Find joy.
Find freedom
in saying, "I don't know." And then learning
what you don't know
will develop
the muscle memory you need
to take that fearlessness and turn it into
something. I can't just say being
fearless at everything
is the right answer.
But in chasing your dreams and chasing
your ambition,
it certainly is critical.
