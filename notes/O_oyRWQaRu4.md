### 传统职业观的挑战

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 努力工作。升职，更努力地工作，再升职，然后攀登企业阶梯。这是我们很多人从小就听信的剧本。但根据德勤（Deloitte）2025年的一项研究，这并不是一些年轻工作者感兴趣的。研究发现，只有6%的Z世代工作者希望晋升到领导岗位。相反，他们更看重工作与生活的平衡、灵活性和心理健康。他们希望赚钱并找到职业满足感。当然，他们只是不想在追求这些的过程中被耗尽心力。那么，当抱负不再是主要驱动力时，会发生什么？这是《The Rundown》。

今年格莱美颁奖典礼上，音乐家兼制作人菲董（Pharrell Williams）告诉观众，永不停止打拼，永不停止工作。停止做除了工作以外的任何事情。我们习惯了听到抱负是件好事，你不应该永远满足。但在“后抱负时代”的生活中，一位优秀的记忆录作者和广播员阿米尔·尼亚兹（Amil Niaz）挑战我们以全新的方式看待我们的生活和成就。米尔（Mièle）加入我们在演播室。你怎么样？

**Host (Jeyan)**: Work hard. Get a promotion, work harder, get another promotion and climb that corporate ladder. That's the script a lot of us grew up with. But according to a 2025 study from Deloitte, that's not what some younger workers are interested in doing. The study found only 6% of Gen Z workers want to move into a leadership position. Instead, they want things like work-life balance, flexibility and mental health. They want to make money and find professional satisfaction. Sure, they just don't want to get burned out getting there. So what happens when ambition isn't the main character anymore? This is The Rundown.

At the Grammys this year, musician and producer Pharrell Williams told the audience, never stop grinding and never stop working. Stop doing anything else but working. And we're used to hearing that ambition is a good thing, that you should never be satisfied. But in life after ambition, a good enough memoir writer and broadcaster, Amil Niaz challenges us to look at our lives and accomplishments in a whole new way. Mièle joins us in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 我很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: I'm good. How are you?

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 我很好。恭喜你的回忆录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: I'm doing well. Congratulations on the memoir.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Thank you.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 从一位千禧一代到另一位，我必须问，千禧一代的承诺和责任是如何塑造抱负的观念的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: From one millennial to another, I have to ask, how did the promise and the responsibilities of the millennial generation sort of shaped the ideas of ambition?

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 嗯，我是如此庆幸你提到了菲董的引言。我记得他说了那句话，我当时就想，不，不，这正是我不想再听到的。我的意思是，正是这样的信息，我想，你知道，你可能还记得小时候听了很多，努力工作，你知道，为了实现你的梦想牺牲你生活中的一切，即使只有少数人能实现那个梦想。但永不停止打拼，永不停止奋斗，永不停止工作。这就是我成长的环境。当时的想法是，无论你的处境如何，无论你是在贫困中长大，无论你是一个移民，你知道，无论生活给了你什么，如果你愿意非常努力地工作，牺牲一切，奋斗，打拼，那么你就能拥有美国梦，你知道，你就能拥有它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Well, I mean, I'm so glad you brought up the Pharrell quote. I remember him saying that and me just thinking, no, no, this is exactly what I don't want to hear anymore. I mean, it's messages like that that I think, you know, you may recall having heard a lot as a kid, work hard, you know, sacrifice anything in your life in order to achieve your dream, even though only a handful of us are ever going to get that dream. But never stop grinding, never stop hustling, never stop working. And that's what I grew up with. That was the idea was that no matter your circumstance, no matter if you grew up in poverty, no matter if you were an immigrant, you know, no matter whatever life handed you, if you were willing to work really hard, sacrifice everything, hustle, grind, then you could have the American dream, you know, you could have it.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 所有的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: All off is.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 房子。你可以有一个家庭。你可以有两辆车。你可以有一个小屋。你可以每年都去度假。我43岁了。你知道，我不知道你有多少这些东西。我没有多少。我的意思是，我有一个美满的家庭，我有一个很棒的生活，但我并不是按照那些步骤得到的。对。所以，我认为抱负这个想法，正如我们被承诺的，并且与我们被承诺的精英主义（meritocracy）这个想法紧密交织在一起，我认为在我们这一代人的生命中已经彻底破灭了。你知道，我们经历过多次金融危机。9/11事件，我认为，在文化上真正改变了我们看待许多不同事物的方式。所以，是的，我认为千禧一代的梦想早已破灭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: The house. You could have a family. You could have two cars. You could have a cottage. You could go on vacations every year. I'm 43. I you know, I don't know how many of those things you have. I don't have many. I mean, I have a wonderful family and I have a great life, but I didn't get it following those steps. Right. And so I think that idea of ambition, as we were promised and very much interlaced with this idea of meritocracy that we were promised, I think has really exploded in our generation's lifetime. You know, we've lived through multiple financial crises. 9/11, I think, really culturally shifted how we looked at a lot of different things. So, yeah, I think the millennial dream went bust a long time ago.

</details>

### 移民家庭的现实与挑战

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的，让我们来谈谈，我想回到你和家人在一起的时候，我们谈论承诺，但我想更多地谈谈移民家庭的具体现实。你认为，你知道，从家庭内部和你在家里的情况，与你在教室、学校、工作以及你在回忆录中记录的所有那些事情的现实相比，这些情况是如何让事情变得困难的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Well, let's talk a little bit about sort of I want to take it back to when with your family, we talk about the promise, but I want to talk about a little bit more of the realities being specific from an immigrant family. How did how did some of that make it difficult, you know, in terms of, I would call it the inside where you're at home versus what you were facing in the reality of your classroom, school, work and all of that stuff that you document in your memoir.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 是的，我的意思是，我是第一代移民。所以我的家人来自巴基斯坦。他们不会说这门语言。他们来到这个国家时，名下几乎没有钱。你知道，我的几个叔叔在这里，所以他们只有最基本的支持。他们抛弃了一切来到这里，为了更好的生活。这也意味着他们大部分时间都在努力安顿下来，努力找个住处，努力找工作，努力弄懂这个非常非常不同的官僚体系。他们没有多少精力来帮助我们弄清楚这些。对。就像移民的孩子们常常被扔给社会自己去闯荡。所以我们很多时候也不会说那门语言。但是，你知道，孩子们，孩子们不像你想象的那样欢迎外来者。尽管我们我们想相信其他情况，你知道吗？所以我记得我感到非常迷茫，非常困惑，不知道该向谁寻求指导和帮助。我的父母忙于为自己弄清楚这一切，而我作为长女，也得为我的弟妹们弄清楚。所以我感到很大的压力。当然，有时候我不得不帮助我的父母处理文件，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Yeah, I mean, I my I'm first generation to this country. So my family came from Pakistan. They didn't speak the language. They had very, very little money to their name when they came to this country. You know, a couple of my uncles were here, so they had the just the most bare bones of support. They left everything behind to come and have a better life. And that also meant that they were really spending most of their time trying to get set up right, trying to get a place to live, trying to get jobs, trying to figure out this very, very different bureaucratic system. They didn't really have that same energy to spend on helping us figure it out. Right. Like the kids of of immigrants often are just thrown to the wolves. And so we're many times not speaking the language either. But we, you know, kids, kids are not as welcoming as you would think to outsiders. As much as we we want to believe otherwise, you know? So I remember just feeling very lost, very confused and not really knowing where to turn to for guidance and for help. My parents were busy figuring it out for themselves, and I, as the eldest daughter was was kind of also the one to figure it out for my siblings. So I felt a lot of pressure. Sometimes I would have to help my parents navigate paperwork, of course, right?

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Yes.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 入籍考试。我帮他们学习。我教他们英语，同时我自己也在学习。所以当你已经承担了所有这些事情时，就很难再去专注于你的学业或你自己，并弄清楚我真正想要什么，因为我忙于确保我父母的这个愿景在我们来到这个新国家后不会破灭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Citizenship tests. I was helping them study. I was teaching them English while I was trying to learn it myself. And so when you're already taking on all of that stuff, it's really hard to then try and concentrate on your studies or yourself and figure out what is it that I really want, because I'm so busy trying to make sure that this vision that my parents had does not crumble once we're in this new country.

</details>

### 工作场所的现实与个人困境

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。你在书中很早就写道，当抱负被不平等所削弱或被用来对付你时，它就变成了一件有趣的事情。它呈现出一种锯齿状的形状，似乎是为了伤害任何仍希望抓住它的人。然而多年来，我仍然试图抓住它，在不同的公司里步步为营，我接受了策略性的降薪和职位头衔，这些职位包含了更多的工作但没有额外的薪水，希望抱负能以某种方式让我解脱。让我们来谈谈工作场所。在攀登阶梯的道路上，工作场所是如何与你生活中的经历不符的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Alright. Early in the book you write, ambition becomes a funny thing when it is blunted by inequality or used against you. It takes on a jagged shape, one that seems designed to maim anyone still hoping to grasp it. Yet for years, I still tried to grab on, inching my way up and across different companies, I took strategic pay cuts and job titles that included a lot more work with no extra salary, in the hope that ambition would somehow set me free. Let's talk about the workplace. How is the workplace on the way up the ladder, not aligned with what you were experiencing in life?

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 是的。你知道，我的意思是，我，我学了新闻学，希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Yeah. You know, I mean, I, I studied journalism in the hopes that.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 你没有选一个容易的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: You didn't pick an easy.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 不，我没有。那不是最明智的。我的意思是，我能预测整个行业会彻底崩溃吗？不能。我也选择它，因为它在某种程度上接近我的梦想。对。它是那种，可以说是父母认可的版本，是我真正想做的事情，那就是对的。对。当时我在温哥华。那是一个非常非常困难的时期，我试图找到我想要的那种工作。我在这行找不到一份能救命的工作。我搬到了多伦多，最终找到了一份工作，我非常兴奋。然后我接受了。那个想法是努力工作，埋头苦干，不要发出太多噪音，做好工作，你就会爬上阶梯。不幸的是，我认为这对很多女性，年轻女性，有色人种女性来说并非现实，存在着无形的障碍，而我们作为一个社会已经开始谈论它了。你知道，人们对我的成就抱有期望，但有一种无形的上限，我就是无法超越它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: No, I did not. It was not the wisest. I mean, could could I have predicted that the entire industry would essentially collapse in on itself? No. I also picked it because it was sort of adjacent to my dream. Right. It was the like, kind of parental approved version of what I really wanted to do, which was right. Right. And I was in Vancouver. It was a very, very difficult time to be trying to find the kind of work that I was looking for. I could not get a job to save my life in the industry. I moved to Toronto and I finally did find something, and I was so excited. And I took that. That idea work really hard, put your head down, don't make a lot of noise, and just do a good job and you will climb up the ladder. Unfortunately, that's not the reality for a lot of, I think women, young women, women of colour, there are invisible barriers and we've started to talk about it as a society. You know, people had expectations of how much I could accomplish, and there was a sort of an invisible ceiling that where I just couldn't progress beyond it.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 我想谈谈一件在你的书中一定很难详细描述的事情。你描述了一次可怕的袭击，然后又发展出了成瘾。这些事件是如何破坏你最终的目标的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: I want to talk about something that must have been very hard to detail. In your book. You describe a horrific assault and then also developing an addiction. How did those instances derail what you were ultimately aiming for?

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 是的。你知道，这是生命中的一个时刻，我真的感觉自己被分裂成了两半。有一个版本的我，完全不知道，你知道，如此可怕的事情会发生在一个人身上。然后是经历过这一切的那个版本的我，我必须决定我是否会走出来，以及如何走出来。而那时，我生活中唯一不变的、唯一稳定的、可以依靠的就是工作。所以我认为找到一种方法来应对如此悲惨、可怕且改变人生的事情，同时又在工作中做得很好，这一点非常重要。我非常害怕我所经历的事情会影响我的职业生涯。我把它写进书里，因为我认为很多人都经历过。很多人都有这些悲剧。我认识的一个人，她丈夫刚去世，我当时想的只有，她工作怎么办？你知道，在这种环境下她能负担得起请假吗？这真是太 sad 了。而且我认为你在大流行期间也看到了。这对很多人来说是生死攸关的情况。然而，我们很多人都在讨论工作。我们能保住工作吗？我们能继续下去吗？比如，我们怎么继续制造小玩意儿？即使我们很多人都在为全家人的安危而担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: Yeah. You know, it it was one of those moments in life where you I really felt I was like split into two. There was the version of me that had no idea that, you know, something that terrible could happen to a person. And then there's the version of me that has lived through it, and I have to decide if I'm going to come out the other side and how. And at the time, the only thing, the only constant, the only stable thing in my life that I could turn to was work. And so I just felt it was so important that I find a way to navigate something so tragic and and awful and life changing, while still doing a great job at work. I was terrified to let what had happened to me affect my career. I put it in the book because I think a lot of people go through that. A lot of people have these these tragedies. Someone I know, her husband just died and I'm all I could think about was, what is she going to do about work? You know, can she afford to take time off in, in this environment like, it's it's so sad. And I think you saw it in the pandemic. It was a life or death situation for so many people. And yet the biggest conversation a lot of us were having was about work. Could we keep our jobs? Could we keep going? Like, how do we keep making widgets? Even though many of us are afraid for our whole families?

### 疫情期间的写作与意义

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 当你提起大流行病时，我想谈谈你在那个时期写的东西。能告诉我一些关于在大流行期间，谈论痛点，这种工作是如何给你带来意义的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: As you bring up the pandemic, I want to talk about what you were writing during that time. Tell me a little bit about how, during that pandemic, talking about the pain points, how that kind of work gave you purpose.

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 在大流行病的那一刻。我怀着第二个孩子，家里有个蹒跚学步的孩子，我和丈夫刚从伦敦搬回来。我们没有工作，或者我们在找工作，我试图工作和照顾孩子，还要照顾我的，就像我妈妈也在家里一样，所有这一切都在一个非常小的空间里进行。我感觉我的大脑着火了。我做了我当时唯一知道该怎么做的事情。我写作，我一开始在社交媒体上分享其他父母分享的内容。编辑们开始联系我，说，你知道，这非常有共鸣。你会为我们写这个吗？所以它真的变成了一种，就像一种求助。这引起了很多人的共鸣，并由此诞生了。最终，我在《The Cut》上的专栏，现在还在继续，叫做《The Hard Part》，它催生了许多其他病毒式传播的文章，关于我们作为父母、作为职业父母、作为新手妈妈所经历的一切，因为你知道，为人父母非常不同。如果你在大流行病期间刚生了孩子，你无法真正与其他人产生共鸣，因为你不会有访客。你甚至可能不会去公园，对吧？你不能和其他人见面。你没有任何支持系统。所以，你知道，我自己也在经历这一切。是的，我找到了一个社群。我想，我在很多方面找到了我的声音。它确实创造了一种，就像一本书本身，因为那是我最终弄清楚的，比如，这就是我必须做的，这就是我想做的。我终于觉得，没有什么可失去的了。让我们放手去做吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: In that moment in the pandemic. Pregnant with my second, having a toddler at home, my husband and I had just moved back from London. We didn't have jobs or or we were looking for jobs, and I was trying to work and parent and and take care of my like my mom was in the house as well and do it all in this super tiny space. And I felt like I was like my brain was on fire. And I did the only thing I knew how to do, really, in a time like this. And I wrote and I and I was out there first on just on social media, sharing what other parents were sharing. And editors started reaching out and saying, you know, this is very relatable. Will you write this for us? And so that it really became this, like cry for help. That resonated with a lot of people and that it did spawn. Ultimately, my column in The Cut, which continues now called The Hard Part, and it's spawned a lot of other viral pieces about just like what we were all going through as parents, as working parents, as new moms, because, you know, parenthood was so different. If you just had a baby in the pandemic, you couldn't really relate to anyone else because you weren't going to like drop ins. You weren't maybe even going to the park, right? You couldn't meet up with other people. You had no support system. And so, you know, I was going through that myself. And yes, I found a community of people. I found my voice, I think, in many ways. And it did it did create a kind of the book in itself, because that was where I finally figured out, like, this is what I have to do, this is what I want to do. And I finally, there's nothing to lose. Let's go for it.

### 拥抱自我，重新定义“足够好”

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 在我们最后几分钟里，让我们来谈谈。你在书的跋文中写道，我一生中很多次试图逃避自己，成为一个更好的人。我抛弃了过去，否认了自己很多部分，试图吸引一种被告知是唯一值得追求的成功。我让贫困塑造了我的欲望。我让暴力威胁了我的职业生涯。我让别人对母性的看法改变了我的焦点。一旦我学会拥抱自己的每一个部分，我就找到了一个值得讲述的故事。你的故事副标题是“一本足够好的回忆录”。《足够好？》抱负的新观念？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Let's talk about it in our last couple of minutes that we have here. In your book's epilogue, you write, so many times in my life I tried to run away from myself to be someone better. I pushed away the past and denied so many parts of myself to try and attract a type of success that I was told was the only one worth pursuing. I let poverty shape my desires. I let violence threaten my career. I let other people's idea of motherhood change my focus. Once I learned to embrace every single part of me, I found a story worth telling. Your story subtitle is a good enough memoir. How is Good Enough? A New Idea of ambition?

</details>

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 你知道，我想说实话，很长一段时间，我觉得这是一种非常外在的东西，比如，你在这里足够好吗？你足够好成为一个母亲吗？这是别人为你定义的。现在我选择它作为我自己定义的东西。我在这里足够好。我作为一个母亲足够好，因为我爱我的孩子，他们吃饱了，他们快乐，他们被爱着。我认为这非常有力量。你知道，很多时候，这种平庸的想法，它是被鄙视的。我想如果我们把它重新定义为满足和满意，就像我说的，为自己重新定义“足够好”。这会非常自由。我感觉我职业生涯中最快乐、最满足的时刻，就是说“不”并在感觉不对劲时走开，并为自己定义“好”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mièle (Amil Niaz)**: You know, I think truthfully, for a long time it was something that I felt was very external, like, are you good enough to be here? Are you good enough to be a mom? And it was something that was being defined for you. And now I choose it as something I define for myself. I am good enough to be here. I am good enough as a mother because I love my kids and they're fed and they're happy and they're loved. And I think that that can be very empowering. You know, a lot of times this idea of mediocrity, it's it's shunned upon. And I think if we reframe it as contentment and satisfaction and like I said, redefine good enough for yourself. It can be very freeing. I feel the happiest I've ever felt the most satisfied in my career that I've ever felt, saying no and walking away when I feel like something's not right and and defining good for myself.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 那太美了。我们得在这里结束了。非常感谢你。非常感谢你的见解。恭喜你的书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: That was beautiful. We're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Congratulations on the book.

**米尔 (Amil Niaz)**: 谢谢。谢谢你邀请我。

### 新一代的职业诉求

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。我们听到了所有的表达。付出110%。埋头苦干。付出额外的努力。但如果你想要一个更平衡的生活呢？如果你更专注于学习和发展，而不是职业晋升呢？这些都是很多年轻工作者在问的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Okay. We've heard all the expressions. Give it 110%. Put your nose to the grindstone. Go the extra mile. But what if you want a more well-balanced life? What if you're more focused on learning and development than career advancement? Those are the kinds of things a lot of younger workers are asking.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 我刚刚经历了人生中最大的改变，那就是辞掉了我的公司工作，而且几乎没有备用计划。我决定生命太短暂了，不能做那些不能让我充实的事情，要真正冒险并相信自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: I just went through the biggest change in my life, which was leaving my corporate job with really no backup plan. I decided that life is too short to do something that isn't filling my cup, and to really take a risk and bet on myself.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 这变得太多了。我筋疲力尽了。我真的筋疲力尽了，有时我感到非常难过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: It just became a lot. I was burnt out. I was really burnt out and I was feeling very sad sometimes.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 所以经过很多深思熟虑，以及与人力资源和公司反复沟通后，我最终决定是时候离开了，去寻找其他机会，即使这意味着我将不得不经历一段不确定时期，不知道接下来要做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: So after a lot of deliberation and a lot of back and forth with the HR and the company, I finally decided that it was time for me to move on and look for other opportunities, even though that meant that I will have to go through a period of uncertainty about what I wanted to do next.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 特里西娅·威廉姆斯是 TMU 未来技能中心（TMU Future Skills Centre）的研究、评估和知识动员总监，她加入了我在演播室。你怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Tricia Williams is the Director of Research, Evaluation and Knowledge Mobilisation at TMU Future Skills Centre, and she joins me in the studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 非常感谢。我很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Thank you so much. I'm great. How are you?

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 我很好。我想听听你对我们刚才看的那个视频的看法。我们听到了“倦怠”。我们听到了“押注自己”这句话。不确定性。告诉我，当你看到这些视频时，你的想法是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: I'm doing well. I want to get your thoughts on that video that we just watched. We heard burnout. We heard the phrase bet on yourself. Uncertainty. Tell me, what are your thoughts when you see those videos?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 哦，当我看到这个时，我看到了年轻人说“我想要一些不同的东西，我将去追求一些机会”。所以我认为他们是在说他们想要一个更好的未来。无论他们如何定义它。我们知道年轻人，总的来说，就像我在这里做广泛的概括一样，现在普遍倾向于高度重视工作的质量，比前几代人更甚。这包括灵活性，有前进的道路，并真正地说，“我想为自己创造那样的机会”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Oh, when I see this, I see young people who are saying I want something different for myself and I'm going to pursue some opportunities. So I think they're they're saying that they want a better future for themselves. However they define that. And we know that young people, by and large, like I'm making broad generalizations here, generally tend to value quality of work very highly now, more so than previous generations. And that involves having flexibility, having pathways forward, and really saying, I want to create those kinds of opportunities for myself.

</details>

### 对话与工作场所的真实性

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 德勤（Deloitte）的调查，调查了23,000名Z世代和千禧一代，发现年轻专业人士在工作中寻求更多的真实性，请帮助我们理解，当我们谈论真实性的概念时，我们指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: The Deloitte survey, which looked at 23,000 Gen Z's and millennials and found that young professionals are looking for more authenticity at work, help us understand what are we talking about when we talk about the concept of authenticity?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 德勤的研究确实与我们在未来技能中心所做的许多工作相呼应，那就是关注工作质量，我们发表了几篇专门研究年轻人的论文。我们发现的一件事是，年轻人不希望在个人生活和工作生活之间存在价值不匹配。你说的“真实性”这个词，我认为总结得很好。它是在寻找机会，既能谋生，又能生活。这包括诸如心理健康支持、工作与生活的平衡或能够请假等事情。这不仅仅是，你知道，很多天的休息，而是真正感受到支持去做这些事情。我认为当我们与年轻人进行这项研究时，这些事情得到了响亮而清晰的体现，你知道，他们正在寻找方法来过上那种生活，而不仅仅是，你知道，打卡，打卡上班，然后拿到薪水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: The Deloitte study really parallels a lot of work that we've done at the Future Skills Centre, which was looking at quality of work, and we did a few papers that specifically looked at young people. And one of the things we find is that young people don't want to have value mismatch between their personal lives and their work lives. It's really so the word authenticity you said, I think, sums it up very well. It's looking for those opportunities to both make a living, but also make a life. And that involves things that like mental health supports or work life balance or being able to take time off. That's not just, you know, so many days off, but really feeling supported to do those things. And I think we saw those kinds of things come through really loud and clear when we did this research with young people that, you know, they were looking for ways to have that life that wouldn't just be, you know, putting in the time clock, punching their card in and getting a paycheque.

### 工作场所的适应与灵活性

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。鉴于目前工作场所的现状，它们如何支持这些目标，这些看似崇高的目标，对于一些可能，我不想说停滞不前，但它们如何支持自己的目标呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Okay. With that being said, with how established workplaces are right now, how can they support those goals, those lofty what seem like for maybe for some companies or organizations that might be, I don't want to say stuck in the past, but how do they support their goals?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 是的。不，很容易说，“哦，我的天哪，现在的年轻人，他们不想努力工作，他们不想做我们做过的事情”。你知道，我有时作为一名经理，我也会犯这种错误，你会想，“我希望你工作”，对吧？我希望你做这些事情。是的，我们可以做到这一切。所以这不是非此即彼。而是。所以我认为，你知道，我认为我们现在正处于一个巨大的转变之中，从一个工作岗位稀缺的世界，到一个技能稀缺的世界。所以我认为，你知道，越来越多的雇主想要获得他们真正需要的技能来推动业务改进，推动项目交付，推动卓越。他们将需要在劳动力市场上争夺这些技能。而年轻人拥有许多这些技能。他们拥有令人难以置信的创造力。他们有想法。他们是人工智能原生代。在我们调查过的所有不同群体中，他们是采用人工智能的最高群体。我认为想要利用这一点，企业和公司需要做出一些改变来吸引年轻人。这并不总是困难或昂贵的。所以我提到尽可能灵活。我知道我们正处于重返办公室的时代，但是否有任何灵活性？也许每周一两天，甚至只是偶尔说一句，“我们知道你需要在家工作”？在开始或结束时间方面是否有任何灵活性，这些事情，比如找到那种灵活性和活力，只要可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. No, it's really easy to say, oh my gosh, young people these days, they don't want to work hard, they don't want to do what we did. And you know, I'm guilty sometimes as a manager you're thinking, I want you to work, right? I want you to do these things. And yes, we can do all that. And so it's not either or. It's. And so I'd say, you know, one of the things I think we're in the midst of right now is a whole transition from a world in which, you know, we had a scarcity of jobs to one in which we have a scarcity of skills. And so I think, you know, more and more employers who want to access the skills that they really need to drive their business improvement, to drive their program delivery, to drive excellence. They're going to need to compete for those skills among the labour market. And young people have a lot of those skills. They have incredible creativity. They have ideas. They are AI natives. They are the highest group that is adopting artificial intelligence among any of the different groups we've surveyed. And I think businesses and companies that want to harness that will need to look at making some changes to entice young people. It doesn't always have to be difficult or expensive. So I mentioned flexibility whenever possible. So I know we're in an era of return to office mandates, but is there any flexibility around that? Maybe 1 or 2 days a week or even just say occasionally, we know you're going to need to work from home? If is there any kinds of flexibility on start times or end times, those sort of things like finding that flexibility and dynamism where you can.

### YOLO文化与可负担性危机

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。我想更好地理解一下，我将引用一位多伦多说唱歌手德雷克（Drake）的话，“YOLO”，你只活一次。他在2010年代初期普及了这句话。因为这种观念，人们辞职的决定有多大影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Okay. I want to have a better understanding of I'm going to quote a Toronto rapper, Drake, YOLO, you only live once. He popularized that phrase in the early 2010s. How much does quitting because of that sort of concept play into some of the decisions for people to quit?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 是的，这是我思考了很多的事情，因为，你知道，像许多人一样，我的生活中也有年轻人。我希望我就是其中之一。有时我不能说我现在还是了，但我确实看到，你知道，人们和年轻人谈论这个。哦，他们只是在过这种“YOLO”的生活。我认为年轻人正在做的事情是说“我们想要一个更好的社会契约”。对。所以是的，我会工作。我会投入时间来发展我的事业。但是我想知道，我能买房子吗，当我做所有那些工作的时候？或者我甚至买不起公寓吗？我能在周末出去吃饭吗？比如可负担性是其中的关键部分。所以我想，你知道，如果有时人们说，“看，我存不了钱，我买不了房子，我只想活在当下”。我的意思是，我们能责怪他们吗？你知道，如果你要存那么多钱，努力工作，而你仍然买不起你梦想的生活，以及你父母为你梦想的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah, it's something you know, I've thought a lot about because, you know, like many people, I have young people in my life. I wish I was one of them. Sometimes I can't say that I am anymore, but I, I do see, you know, people talk about this with young people. Oh, they're just doing this YOLO life. What are the things I think young people are doing is saying we want a better social contract. Right. So yes, I will work. I will put time in to make my career. But I want to know, can I buy a house right when I do all that work? Or am I not even going to be able to afford a condo? Can I afford to go out to eat on the weekends? Like affordability is a key part of this. So I think, you know, if sometimes people are saying, look, I can't save, I can't buy a house, I am just going to live in the moment. I mean, can we blame them? You know, if you're going to do all of that saving and work so hard and you still can't get the life that you have dreamt of and that your parents have dreamt of for you.

### 替代职业路径：网红与内容创作者

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 我想谈谈就业市场也不同，因为当我们看选项、替代方案时。你认为年轻一代是否认为他们有更多的选择？我想，与你把那个比作“打卡”的类比相比。是的。嗯，现在的替代方案可能是对很多人来说，成为内容创作者或网红。有这些选择，比如，“嗯，如果这个行不通，我我可以，我可能可以做这个”。或者如果我把它作为副业来做，你知道吗？我看到了一些我的劳动成果。是的。让我过渡到那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: I want to talk about the job market is also different in that when we look at the options, the alternatives. Do we think that the younger generation perceive that they have more options available? I'm thinking, in comparison to you put that analogy of kind of putting in your punch card. Yeah.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 是的。你知道，这很有趣，因为，你知道，我从来不想成为一名内容创作者。我几乎不能发帖给我的家人和朋友，但很多人确实渴望这样做。而且我认为，你知道，同样的方式。就像30年前很难想象你可以拥有一个完全在线的业务一样。对吧？所以任何技术或，你知道，发展时代都会创造新的工作，同样一些工作也会消失，对吧？我们现在的行政助理可以使用人工智能工具，他们的角色正在改变。所以当我们说，如果年轻人想成为内容创作者有问题吗？不。我认为，你知道，这就是我们生活中的新经济。我们认为现在有价值吗？它作为一种可行生活方式，可行职业，我应该说不是生活方式。它在加拿大对年轻人来说是一种可行的生计吗？嗯，我想这比其他地方要少一些。所以你可能会看到美国的年轻人拥有截然不同的变现结构。在这里。你无法通过观看和点击等方式赚取相同的金钱。所以它是一个较少选择的选项。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. You know, it's it's funny because, you know, I would never want to be a content creator. I can barely post to my family and friends, but a lot of people do aspire to this. And I think, you know, the same way. Like it was hard to imagine 30 years ago that you could have a fully online business. Right? So new jobs get created with any kind of technology or, you know, era of development the same way some disappear, right? We might administrative assistants now can use AI tools and their role is changing. So when we say like is it a problem if young people want to be content creators? No. I think, you know, this is the new economy we live in. Do we think there's value there now? The extent to which it's a viable lifestyle, viable career, I should say not lifestyle. Is it a viable livelihood for young people in Canada? Well, I'd say that's a little bit less than other places. So you might be looking at young people in the US that have a much different monetization structure. Right here. You can't earn money the same way from views and clicks and so forth. So it is less of an option.

### 公司如何适应新态度

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。我想把调查带回来。调查发现，Z世代更关注工作与生活的平衡，而不是攀登企业阶梯。公司如何扭转这种态度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: All right. I want to bring back the survey. The survey found that Gen Z's are more focused on work life balance than climbing that corporate ladder. How can companies turn that attitude around?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 嗯，你知道吗？我们对工作质量进行了研究。我们发现人们普遍明确表示，他们希望有机会学习和成长。对。这对加拿大来说太棒了。我们需要人们不断学习，不仅是在职业生涯早期，而且贯穿他们的整个职业生涯，因为，你知道，技术变化如此之快，而我们需要的技能。所以当我们说，“年轻人想进入领导层吗？”。我想他们可能会，但在正确条件下。那么条件是什么呢？也许你想确保你的中层管理者没有筋疲力尽，没有过度劳累。也许他们需要更多的支持。这众所周知是中层管理者苦苦挣扎的事情，对吧？我自己也曾是中层管理者，我知道这是真的。你在中间受到挤压。所以我认为，你知道，年轻人说我们不一定想要前几代人接受的那种交易。我认为最重要的是，这对我们所有人来说都是一个调整的挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, you know what? We did research on the quality of work. We really found that people were unanimously clear and that they want opportunities to learn and grow. Right. And this is great. We need that as Canada. We need people to be continually learning, not just early in their career, but throughout their careers, because, you know, technology is changing so fast and the skills we need. So when we say, do young people want to go into leadership? I'd say they might, but under the right conditions. So what are the conditions? Maybe you want to make sure your middle managers aren't burned out and aren't so overworked. Maybe they need to be supported more. This is famously something that middle management struggles with, right? And having been a middle manager myself, I know it's true. You get your squeezed in the middle. So I think, you know, young people are saying we don't necessarily want the deal that previous generations have accepted. And I think more than anything, that's a challenge to all of us to adjust.

</details>

### 经济衰退与长期影响

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 在最近《麦克林氏》的一篇文章中，你写道，在经济衰退期间成长会长期阻碍一个人的成长，即使在经济稳定之后。这对刚起步的人意味着什么？而且这不一定仅仅是经济衰退。如果我们看看我们现在所处的位置，我的意思是，我们已经脱离新冠疫情几年了，但新冠疫情与之有很大关系。气候是一个大问题。很多人对此非常恐惧。当你把所有年轻人面临的事情都打包在一起时，他们该如何开始呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: In a recent Maclean's article, you wrote, coming of age during an economic downturn can hinder a person's growth from a long time, even after the economy has stabilized. What does that mean for people starting out? And it's not necessarily just an economic downturn. If we look at where we are right now, I mean, we are a few years removed from Covid, but Covid had a lot to do with it. Climate is a big thing. A lot of people are very scared of that. When you package all of the things that are facing young people, how do how do you even start out?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 嗯，我们做了一些研究，研究了我们称之为“长期劳动力市场疤痕效应”。它实际上是基于90年代初的数据，那时我还是一名年轻人在90年代初，而那些毕业时遇到经济衰退的人，你可以实际从经验上将年轻人更高的失业率与较低的工资水平联系起来，即使在十年后。所以我们说，当你毕业时，经济状况对你长期的收入产生了长期影响，他们花了十年时间才从中恢复过来。所以我认为这会做什么，嗯，首先，我这么说不是为了劝阻任何现在的年轻人或他们担心他们的父母或家人。但我确实认为这表明需要一些社会政策干预。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, we did some research that looked at the long term labour market scarring effect that we called. And it really it's built on data from the early '90s, when I was a young person in the early '90s and people who graduated into a recession, you can actually empirically link a higher level of unemployment for youth with a lower wage level, even up to ten years later. So we're saying that there was a long impact of that when you graduated and the economic conditions in your longer term earnings, it took them ten years to recover from that. So what I think that does is, well, for one, I don't say that to discourage any young person now or their parents or family members who are concerned about them. But I do think it points to the need for some social policy interventions.

</details>

### 政府的角色与代际投资

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 好的。嗯，让我们来谈谈，你谈到了这一点，工作场所可以做什么，政府也可以。他们也能做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Okay. Well, let's talk, well, let's talk about you've talked about this, what workplaces can do, but also governments. What can they do as well.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 是的。我的意思是，这就是你知道的，我们正在进行代际投资，用政府的话来说，以及我们国家的基建，同样的方式。我认为我们需要思考社会基础设施中的代际投资。所以年轻人绝对至关重要。他们是我们未来的医生、律师、护士，以及将来照顾我的那些人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. And I mean this is where you know, we're in a in we're making generational investments, to use the government's words and the infrastructure of our country the same way. I think we need to be thinking about generational investments in the social infrastructure. So young people are absolutely critical. They are our future doctors and lawyers and nurses and and the people who are going to be taking care of me when I'm old and.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 灰白，你和我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Grey, you and I.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 我们俩。所以我们需要确保我们促进他们的教育，对吧？他们向劳动力市场的过渡，并确保所有这些事情发生得比现在更顺利一些。所以这包括，你知道，确保他们有非常好的指导和信息，以帮助他们在高中和大学的关键阶段做出选择，关于是否以及如何进入大学，以确保有各种各样的途径可供选择，无论是技术行业，无论是大学，还是其他某种项目，并确保他们有，你知道，适当的学费支持，经济援助，所有这些。这对年轻人来说是好事。但对我们来说，进行这些投资，确保我们拥有未来所需的劳动力，这一点确实很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Both of us. So we need to make sure that we are facilitating their education, right? Their transitions to the labour market, and to make sure all of those things happen a little more smoothly than they do right now. So that involves, you know, making sure they have really good guidance and information to help make choices at that critical stage in post-secondary and secondary school about whether and how to go forward in post-secondary to make sure there's a variety of pathways available, whether it's the skilled trades, whether it's university, whether it's some other sort of program, and to make sure that they have, you know, appropriate tuition support, financial aid, all of those things. That's good for young people. But it's really important for us to to make those investments, to make sure that we have the workforce we need in the future.

</details>

### 与养老金计划的比较

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 你将它与老年保障计划进行了比较，以便我们在这里可以做什么，当我们试图在这里进行创新时。是的。这个计划，你从这个计划的益处中看到了什么，它如何能帮助年轻人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: You make the sort of comparison to the old age security program to sort of what we can do is that when we're trying to think innovatively here. Yeah. How does that program, sort of what do you see from the benefits of that program to how it can help young people?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 嗯，如果我想到，你知道，加拿大的养老金计划和老年保障计划是如何制定的，它们是在上个世纪中期成熟的，当时老年贫困是一个真正的问题。我们仍然有贫困问题。对。但是，你知道，仍然有很多退休人员面临着，你知道，他们退休计划的核心部分是确保他们不会被追回老年保障金。对。如果我的家人中有处于这种情况的人，你知道，我认为我们作为一个国家，将我们资产的很大一部分投资于支持这个群体。对。我认为我们绝对需要确保它被用在需要的地方。但同时，我认为有一个群体，我们没有从经济必然性的角度去考虑支持和投资他们。我们认为，“哦，年轻人，他们不够努力工作。他们只想玩电子游戏”。顺便说一句，电子游戏是非常好的训练。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, if I think about when, you know, the Canada pension plan and the old age security programs were developed, they they came of age in the middle of the prior century when there was a real issue with senior poverty. And we still have issues with poverty. Right. But like, there's still a lot of retirees who face a, you know, a core plank of their retirement plan is making sure they don't get an OAS clawback. Right. And if people in my family who are in that situation and, you know, I think we we invest a significant portion of our assets as a country into supporting this group. Right. And I think we absolutely need to make sure it goes to where it's needed. But at the same time, I think there's a there's a group that we're not thinking of in terms of an economic imperative to support and invest in them. We think, oh, young people, they're not working hard enough. They just want to play video games. And by the way, video games is very good training.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: That is.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 非常真实。非常真实。你知道，手动灵巧性。所以我确实认为我们需要创造性地思考我们投资于哪些群体以及如何投资，并将其视为一种道德必然。就像战后时期一样，你知道，老年贫困是我们非常关心的一个重大问题。我认为年轻人及其支持需求是我们必须关注的关键问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Very true. Very true. You know, the manual dexterity. So I do think we need to think creatively about the ways and how and which groups we invest in and see it as, as a moral imperative. And the same way in the post-war period, we, you know, senior poverty was a huge issue of concern for us. I think young people and their support needs to be a critical issue for us.

</details>

### 未来工作：以人为本

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 我们谈到了新冠疫情。我们谈到了，你知道，这个国家的代际投资。根据你的研究，未来工作是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: We talked about Covid. We talked about, you know, generational investments in this country. From your research, what does the future of work look like?

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 我认为未来工作将更加人性化。老实说。我认为很多时候我们关注的是技术方面，我认为我们将学会如何让计算机和机器在机器和计算机擅长的自动化方面做得非常好。但我们工作的未来是这样的：它是与人交谈。是与他们互动。是一位药剂师向病人解释药物。是一位医生与某人谈论他们的心理健康或治疗支持。所以我认为未来工作将更加人性化，并由工具、支持和自动化来增强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: I think the future of work is more human. To be honest. I think a lot of times we focus on the technology aspect, and I think we're going to learn how to get computers and machines to be really good at the automated things that machines and computers are going to be really good at. But the future of our work is this it's talking to people. It's engaging with them. It's a pharmacist explaining the medication to a patient. It's a doctor talking to somebody about their mental health or therapy supports. And so I think the future of work is going to be much more human and augmented by tools and supports and automation.

</details>

**主持人 (Jeyan)**: 听起来所有几代人的未来都是光明的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Jeyan)**: Sounds like the future is bright for all generations.

</details>

**特里西娅·威廉姆斯 (Tricia Williams)**: 我希望如此。我的意思是，我有一个九岁的女儿，我想，你知道，她的未来会是什么样子？她，你知道，我认为大多数年轻人，也许他们的工作还没有被创造出来。但是，我认为未来可以是光明的。但我也认为我们必须确保我们创造这些途径。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: I hope so, I mean, I have a nine year old daughter and I think, you know, what's her future going to look like? She, you know, and I think most young people, maybe their jobs have not even been created yet. And but I do think the future can be bright. But I also think we have to make sure we create those pathways.

</details>
