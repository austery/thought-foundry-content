### 央行独立性面临的政治压力

当前，美联储正面临着来自政治层面的巨大压力。特朗普总统公开表达了对美联储政策的不满，并试图通过人事干预来影响货币政策的走向。这种干预行为，挑战了央行独立性的基石，引发了对未来经济前景的担忧。正如演讲者所言，总统似乎倾向于在周末，市场休市时采取行动，这进一步加剧了市场的不确定性。

Hello
 my
 friends,
 today
 is
 January
 17th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week
 was
 a
 week
 jam-packed
 full
 of
 Fed


news.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Looking
 at
 the
 markets
 more
 broadly


though,
 it
 continues
 to
 seem
 to
 me
 that


the
 markets
 are
 losing
 momentum.
 Now
 you


even
 see
 high
 flyers
 like
 silver
 being


sold.
 Now
 we
 are
 moving
 away
 from
 the


very
 seasonally
 positive
 part
 of
 the


year.
 So,
 it
 would
 not
 surprise
 me
 if
 we


were
 to
 consolidate
 or
 correct
 for
 the


coming
 weeks.
 Now,
 this
 episode
 we're


going
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 Fed,
 but
 I
 still


want
 to
 mention
 a
 couple
 notable
 things.

### 美联储主席人选的博弈

美联储主席人选的变动，反映了政治力量对货币政策的影响。原本被视为热门人选的凯文·哈塞特（Kevin Hasset）被总统公开排除，而凯文·沃尔什（Kevin Walsh）则成为新的潜在人选。这一变化引发了市场的剧烈反应，债券收益率曲线随之调整，表明市场对未来货币政策的预期发生了变化。

First
 off,
 there
 was
 escalating


geopolitical
 risk
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.


The
 president
 seems
 to
 have
 held
 off
 on


any
 military
 action,
 but
 as
 we
 know,
 the


president
 doesn't
 like
 to
 announce


military
 action
 before
 it
 happens.
 He


says
 that's
 stupid.
 I
 agree
 with
 him.


And
 of
 course
 he
 only
 likes
 to
 act


during
 the
 weekends
 when
 the
 markets
 are


closed.
 And
 secondly
 uh
 also
 uh
 the


president
 seems
 to
 be
 escalating
 his


rhetoric
 on
 Greenland.
 You
 seem
 to
 have


NATO
 members
 sending
 troops
 to
 kind
 of


make
 a
 stand
 over
 there.
 And
 as
 we're


recording
 it
 seems
 like
 there's
 a


headline
 saying
 that
 the
 president
 will


put
 tariffs
 on
 European
 countries
 for


supporting
 Greenland.
 So
 that
 is


something
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 then
 as
 well.


I
 know
 many
 of
 you
 comment
 or
 some
 of


you
 comment
 why
 is
 he
 talking
 about


politics.
 Isn't
 this
 a
 markets
 show?


From
 my
 perspective,
 politics
 and


markets
 are
 the
 same
 thing.
 Okay,
 now


moving
 on.
 So
 today
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 two
 things.
 First
 off,
 huge


developments
 on
 the
 race
 to
 be
 Fed


chair.
 On
 Friday,
 the
 president


basically
 ruled
 out
 Kevin
 Hasset
 and
 it


seems
 like
 it's
 likely
 that
 Kevin
 Walsh


will
 be
 Fed
 chair.
 So
 let's
 talk
 about


what
 happened.
 And
 there
 was
 a
 very


distinct
 market
 reaction
 to
 that
 and


what
 that
 could
 mean.
 And
 secondly,

### 央行独立制的终结与未来展望

演讲者认为，我们正处于**中央银行**（Central Bank: 负责制定和实施货币政策的机构）独立制的黄昏。他指出，政府干预央行已成为一种趋势，不仅在美国，也在日本等其他国家显现。这种趋势的背后，是政府对货币政策的控制欲增强，以及对央行独立性的质疑。他认为，央行独立性并非一成不变的制度，而是一种适应特定时代背景的安排。随着政府债务的增加和财政政策的影响力增强，央行独立性面临着越来越大的挑战。

think
 the
 biggest
 F
 news
 of
 the
 past


week
 was
 of
 course
 the
 very
 memorable


2-minute
 video
 JPL
 recorded
 last
 Sunday.


J.
 Pal
 basically
 told
 the
 world
 that


guys,
 President
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 take


over
 monetary
 policy.
 Please
 help.
 And


um
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 a
 sign
 of
 the


times.
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 are
 in
 the


twilight
 of
 the
 central
 banks
 and
 that


uh
 the
 Fed
 will
 not
 be
 an
 independent


central
 bank
 and
 many
 other
 central


banks
 in
 the
 world
 will
 lose
 their


independence
 as
 well
 and
 it's
 going
 to


be
 okay.

### 财政主导与财富不平等

演讲者进一步指出，当前经济面临的两个主要问题是财政主导和财富不平等。政府支出不断增加，导致通货膨胀，而央行的货币政策难以有效控制。同时，央行的宽松政策往往导致资产价格上涨，加剧了财富不平等。他认为，解决这些问题需要通过财政政策进行调整，并加强对财富分配的监管。

All right,
 starting
 with
 the
 hasset


tantrum.
 So
 on
 Friday
 the
 president
 was


doing
 a
 press
 conference
 about
 health


related
 stuff
 and
 basically
 just
 you


know
 began
 it
 by
 saying
 this.


>> I
 see
 Kevin's
 in
 the
 audience
 and
 I
 just


want
 to
 thank
 you.
 You
 were
 fantastic
 on


television
 today.
 I
 actually
 want
 to


keep
 you
 where
 you
 are.
 If
 you
 want
 to


know
 the
 truth,
 Kevin
 Hassid
 is
 so
 good.


I'm
 saying,
 "Wait
 a
 minute.
 If
 I
 move


them,
 these
 fed
 guys,
 certainly
 the
 one


we
 have
 now,
 they
 don't
 talk
 much.
 I


would
 lose
 you.
 I
 It's
 a
 serious
 concern


to
 me."
 So,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 thank
 you


very
 much.
 You've
 done
 incredible.


We
 don't
 want
 to
 lose
 him,
 Susie.
 We'll


see
 how
 it
 all
 works
 out.
 Okay.
 Thank


you,
 Kevin.
 Now
