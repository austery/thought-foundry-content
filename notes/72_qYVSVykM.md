### 市场全线飘绿，新高或在眼前

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场未来秀》。我们正在直播，天哪，这周一早上真是太刺激了。当我们从周日晚上过渡到市场开盘时，情况变得非常令人兴奋。很明显，我们正在上涨，女士们先生们。对于那些还没看到的人来说，股指期货全线飘绿。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Market Future Show. We are live and boy oh boy, what a Friday. This is about to become or actually it's not Friday. I've missed my uh I missed my job on Friday. It's about to become a pretty exciting Monday morning as we transition from Sunday night into into the market open. You know, obviously I can't wear a hat because, you know, there's no cap about the fact that we are going higher, folks. We are going higher, ladies and gentlemen. The futures, for those that haven't seen it, are green, green, green, green across the board.</p>
</details>

标准普尔500指数上涨1%，纳斯达克指数上涨1%，小盘股上涨1.13%。**VIX**（Volatility Index，波动率指数，常被称为“恐慌指数”）下跌了7.8%，这真是个好消息。上周VIX指数还在25，现在可能会在18以下开盘，甚至可能低于两周前的17。道琼斯指数基本上创下历史新高，达到47530点，上涨了近一个百分点。这很可能是因为市场发出了我们与中国达成贸易协议的信号。关于中国，我们有很多要谈的。所以，我们接下来会讨论这个。但这注定会是一个激动人心的隔夜市场。

<details>

<p class="english-text">S&P 500 up 1%, the NASDAQ up 1%. Small caps up 1.13. The VIX down 7.8, which is great to see. The VIX was at 25 last week, now potentially going to open up uh below 18, potentially even below 17 where it was two weeks ago. And then you got the Dow Jones basically hitting a all-time high at 47,530, up almost a percent. This is because it likely is signaling that we have a trade deal with China. We got a lot to talk about when it comes to China. So, we'll talk about that. Um, but it's about to be an exciting exciting exciting uh overnight markets. That's to say the least.</p>

### 个人近况：一本关于Karp的书与意外的提及

今天我就是不想戴帽子，仅此而已。这不是什么官方发型之类的。我只是觉得，“管他呢，我不在乎。”所以我就摘了帽子，头发乱糟糟的，但就这样吧。很抱歉周五没能来，伙计们。我不知道周五发生了什么，但在开盘后我就是感觉不舒服。我的声音很奇怪，腿在发抖。我想是天气从热转冷导致的。我甚至给Steve打了电话，他就在聊天室里。我们节目结束后会去他的“另类资产周刊”。我当时跟他说：“兄弟，我可能做不了节目了。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Dude, I just didn't feel like wearing a hat today. That's all. I didn't feel like wearing a hat. This is the first time I actually took my hat off in a while. So, it's not like the official hairstyle or anything. I just said, "You know what? Screw it. I don't care." So, we took the hat off and uh the hair is going all crazy, but there you go. I'm sorry I couldn't make it on Friday, guys. I just I don't know what happened on Friday, but after the close or after the open, I just didn't feel good, bro. Like, I didn't feel My voice was being weird. My like legs were shivering. Like, I I think it it's the the hot to cold weather. Something happened on Friday. I even called Steve. There he is right there in the chat. We'll uh we'll we'll be going over to his alternative assets weekly once we're done with the future show. But I even called him. I was like, "Bro, I don't think I can do the show."</p>
</details>

你们了解我，我真的不喜欢错过我的节目。我只因为看牙医错过节目，如果你的牙医像我的一样漂亮，那这绝对是缺席的好理由。还有就是旅行的时候。除此之外，我从不错过节目。所以，我不知道周五发生了什么，就是感觉不舒服。但我回来了，很高兴能在这里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">He was like, "What? You're going to miss the show?" I'm like, "You know, I I really don't like missing my show. You guys know me. I've I've only missed the show because of the dentist, which is a, you know, good reason to miss the show if if you have a dentist that looks as nice as mine." Um, and then and then I'm traveling. Otherwise, I don't miss the show. So, I don't know what happened on Friday. I just didn't feel good. But I'm back and uh and very excited to be here.</p>
</details>

在我们进入正题之前，有几件事要说。距离隔夜市场开盘还有12分钟，届时价格将会非常疯狂。比特币、以太坊，一切都在飙升。然后我们会讨论这一切发生的原因，以及显然与中国有关的、正在产生影响的事件。比特币达到了115.5，我们现在是114。以太坊终于突破了44100，这真是个好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a couple things before we get into everything we got going on. We got 12 minutes until the overnight markets open and then after those overnight markets where these prices are about to be crazy. Bitcoin, Ethereum, everything's mooning. Then we'll get into the reasons for why all of this is happening along with obviously what's going on with China which is kind of creating this impact. Bitcoin got to 115.5. We're at 114 right now. And then Ethereum finally breaking over 4,4100 which is very nice to see from Ethereum.</p>
</details>

这个周末，我读了一本书。当我说我真的读了这本书时，我是指我昨晚熬夜读的。我还没读完，还剩几章，但我真的在读书。有一本即将出版的书叫做《硅谷哲人》（The Philosopher in the Valley），作者是Michael Steinberger。这本书基本上是关于Karp（Alex Karp，Palantir CEO）的自传。就在刚才的市场期货直播之前，我采访了他两个小时，采访一个Karp在过去五年里给予了很多接触机会的人，感觉非常棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um over the weekend over the weekend I read a book I and when I mean I actually read the book I mean I was up last night. I didn't read the entire thing. I'm still have a couple chapters left but I legit read a book. So there is a book coming out called the philosopher in the valley by Michael Steinberger. He is someone who basically this is basically an autobiography on Karp and before the market futures stream right now I um I interviewed him for the past two hours and it was fascinating to interview a guy who Karp had given a lot of access to over the past five years and that's why I think I read the book.</p>
</details>

这次阅读有两个收获。第一，我意识到如果我真的关心某个主题，我是愿意去阅读的。我昨晚熬夜读书，而我平时看电影五分钟都忍不住要刷推特。我当时在翻书，甚至舔着手指翻页。就是说，如果我感兴趣，我就会去读。第二，它提醒了我，我有多么热爱阅读。我想这可能和我最近在Substack上写得更多有关。我每天都阅读，读很多研究报告和文章，但我不再读实体书了。我有点想重新开始读书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know there there's two takeaways from this. Number one I realized if I actually care about the subject I'm willing to read. Like I was up last night. I can barely watch a movie for five minutes before checking Twitter. I was reading through the book. I was like I was licking my finger to come to get to the next page. Like I just it's like if I'm interested in it, I'll read it. Number two, it taught me or it reminded me how much I love to read. And I think it's maybe because I've been writing more on the Substack and so obviously and I read every day. I read a lot of research and articles and stuff, but I don't read books anymore. I kind of want to get back to reading books.</p>
</details>

如果是我真正关心的东西，我觉得我能读完。而且，你知道，坐下来读书，不被通知、YouTube分心，感觉真的很好。就像很平静。我不知道是不是因为我年纪大了还是什么，但我想重新开始阅读。所以，重点是，这是一本很棒的书。我认为这次采访会很精彩。你们会听到很多以前从未听说过的关于Karp的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if it's a something that I actually care about, I feel like I can get through the book. And you know, it really felt good to not get distracted by notifications or YouTube or and just sit down and read. Like it just felt like peaceful. I don't know if it's because if I'm getting older or something, but as I'm I don't know, I want to get back to reading. So, the point is uh this is an amazing book. I think the interview will be really nice. A lot of you guys will get to hear parts about Karp that you've never heard about before.</p>
</details>

我读到后记的时候，发现我竟然在书里。我妈妈昨晚看到这个时都惊呆了，但我真的在书里，这有点疯狂。只是简短地提了一下，但我在这里给大家读一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I got to the epilogue and I'm in the book. I'm in the book. My mom freaked out last night when she saw this, but I'm in the book and it's kind of crazy. It's it's a it's a it's a small mention, but I'll show you guys right here.</p>
</details>

“2024年12月初，总统大选后几周，Palantir在纽约办公室举办了一场AIP活动。那天早上我到达时，Karp正与一位名叫Kukreja的业余股票评论员深入交谈，他可能是Palantir和Karp在散户投资者社区中最大的粉丝。他现在经常被邀请参加公司的活动，并已成为公司事实上的‘人形吉祥物’。当Karp与Kukreja先生聊天时，他注意到一位女士从房间对面走来，惊呼道：‘哦，我们何德何能有此荣幸？’”然后他谈到了那位女士是谁以及她为什么会见Karp。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll read it. In early December 2024, a few weeks after the presidential election, Pounder hosted an AIP event in the New York office. When I arrived that morning, Karp was deep in conversation with a Cookian, amateur stock commentator who was possibly Palanteers and Karp's biggest fan in the retail investor community. He was now regularly invited to the company's events and had become its deacto human mascot. As Karp chatted with Mr. Kraja, he noticed a woman approaching from across the room and exclaimed, "Oh, to what do we have this honor?" And then he he talks about who the woman was and why she was even meeting Karp.</p>
</details>

这一切都真实发生了。2024年12月，Karp和我在交谈。事实上，我们谈论的是机构投资者多么看好Palantir，以及他有多兴奋。那是在他们被纳入纳斯达克和标普指数后两个月。Michael Steinberger当时也在场，我猜他观察了发生的一切，然后把它写进了后记。所以昨晚看到这个感觉挺疯狂的。我没想到我会在书里占有一席之地，但是的，我在书里，这很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that all happened. That all happened like Karp and I were speaking. We were having a conversation December of 2024. In fact, the conversation was about how much the institutional investors missed a Palunteer and just like how excited he was. was right after they got into the NASDAQ and the S&P. So, this was two months after they got into those indices and Michael Steinberger was there. He was he was I guess he was observing everything that was happening and then he ended up putting it into the epilog. So, that was kind of crazy seeing this last night. I did not think I would get a spot in the book, but yeah, I'm in the book and so it's pretty cool stuff.</p>
</details>

我没有因此拿到报酬，也没有什么版权或姓名使用费之类的。我只是昨晚读到后记时惊呼：“天哪，我竟然在这本该死的书里。”这很酷。我认为你们会喜欢这本书，也会喜欢这次采访，因为里面有很多关于Karp不为人知的事情，包括Karp有一半黑人血统。很多人不知道他是混血儿。他的身份有很多不同层面，比如他对政治、世界的看法，为什么他从未结婚。这本书在很多这些主题上都写得很好，还有他的阅读障碍等等。所以，当采访发布时，我想你们会喜欢的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pretty I'm not I'm not getting paid. I I mean there's no copyright or use of my name or anything like I just I got to the epilog last and I was like, "Holy crap, I'm in the freaking book." So, it's pretty cool stuff. I think you guys will enjoy the book and uh yeah, I think you guys will enjoy the interview as well because there's a lot of parts about Karp that no one knows about, including the fact that Karp is half black. A lot of people don't know that he's biracial, you know, and so there's a lot of different elements of his identity, how he thinks about politics, the world, like why he never got married. It's it's a really good book on a lot of those subjects and um his dyslexia, you know, all that stuff. So, so I think when the interview comes out, you guys will like it and it should be pretty fun.</p>
</details>

是的，我被称为“人形吉祥物”，这太疯狂了。我没有拿到任何版税。我只是昨晚读到后记时才发现，我的名字在那里。我告诉我妈妈，她说：“你的名字为什么在那里？”我说：“我不知道，但我的名字就在那里。”显然，这是一种比喻，代表散户投资者。所以，这很酷。是的，他既是黑人也是犹太人。很多人仍然不知道这一点。他的身份有很多不为人知的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I got called the human mascot, dude. That was crazy. I'm not getting any royalties on this. I didn't I just I I I I got to the epilogue last night. I was like, "Holy crap, my name's there." I told my mom. She was like, "Why is your name there?" I was like, "I don't know, but my name's there. I'm there." And obviously, it was a metaphor for like the retail investor. So, pretty cool stuff. Yeah. Black and Jewish as well. Yeah. A lot of people still don't know that. There's a lot of parts of his to his identity that people don't know. But there you go.</p>
</details>

### 核心催化剂：中美贸易协议曙光初现

好了，距离隔夜市场开盘还有八分钟。我非常兴奋。为什么兴奋？因为我们要上涨了，就这么简单。我们上涨的原因是，根据我过去24小时看到的一切，我们似乎要和中国达成一项协议了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, we got eight minutes until the overnight markets open. Uh I am very excited. Why am I excited? Because we're going higher. It's that simple. We are going higher. And the reason we're going higher is because it looks like from everything I've seen in the past 24 hours, we are getting a deal with China.</p>
</details>

我知道今年基本上就像这张图所体现的那样。但正如Steven Fiorillo先生所说，更高。我们要上涨了。本周我们将讨论财报。这周会非常疯狂。我们还要讨论美联储，因为本周将有一次降息。更不用说SoFi的财报了，顺便说一下，我周五又买了500股SoFi。所以我现在有一千股了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I know that this entire year has basically been a metaphor uh uh embodied through this picture right here. As everyone can see right here on the screen, this picture is literally the basis for how this year has gone. But as Mr. Steven Fiorillo would said, higher. We are going higher. And we're going to get into the earnings conversation this week, guys. This week is going to be crazy. We're going to talk about the Fed because we got a Fed cut coming up this week. Not to mention we got forget SoFi earnings by which by the way I did buy another 500 shares of SoFi on Friday. So your boy's loaded up thousand shares.</p>
</details>

周二有SoFi，周三有Meta、谷歌和微软，都在同一时间。最重要的是，在这些公司发布财报之前，你还有**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee，联邦公开市场委员会，负责制定美国货币政策）会议。这周将是股市历史上最疯狂的一周之一。我不记得上一次Meta、微软和Alphabet在同一时间发布财报是什么时候了。我见过微软和Alphabet一起，也见过Meta和苹果一起。但三家同时，周三盘后绝对会是一片混乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't get to tell you guys because I didn't go live but uh my average is now like $295. Thousand shares I'm loaded up and hopefully not can take us to the promised land. But uh we got SoFi on f on Tuesday we have Meta, Google and Microsoft on Wednesday all at the same time. And then on top of that, you have the FOMC meeting right before all those companies report. I mean, this is going to be one of the most crazy weeks I think we've ever had in stock market history. I don't remember the last time we had Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet happen at the same time. I I've seen Microsoft and Alphabet happen together. I've seen Meta and Apple happen together. But all three of them, I mean, that day Wednesday after close is going to be madness trying to cover everything.</p>
</details>

周二有SoFi和PayPal。周四有亚马逊和苹果。我们有很多公司要公布财报，然后周三早上还有美联储降息。所以这将是疯狂的一周。而让这周更特别的是，如果我们能与中国进行一些实质性的谈判。过去九天我们一直在谈论中国的故事。自从特朗普对中国发怒的消息传出，导致标普500指数五个月来首次下跌3%以来，整个节目的主题一直是他们在谈判，这是筹码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's going to be wild. And then you have SoFi and PayPal on Tuesday. You have Amazon and Apple on Thursday. we just have a lot of companies and then you have that Fed rate cut on Wednesday morning. So, this is going to be a wild week and the way to make this week even more special is if we can get some real negotiations done with China. We've been talking about this China story for the past basically call it nine days now. Ever since the whole kind of Trump is mad at China thing broke out which caused the S&P 500 to fall 3% for the first time in five months. And I think the kind of theme of this entire show has been they're negotiating. It's leverage.</p>
</details>

我们已经经历过这种剧本无数次了。我想我们很多人在10月10日都逢低买入了。我们知道，从历史上看，那个周五股市的资金流入量是过去15年来最大的。我想我们很多人上周五也逢低买入了，不是这个周五，因为这个周五我们收盘创了历史新高，而是上上个周三，当时市场非常动荡。那些逢低买入的人将得到回报，因为根据我们今天听到的消息，我们似乎达成了协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the end of the day, we've been through this playbook a billion times. I think a lot of us bought the dip back on October 10th. I mean, we know historically the stock market had the largest inflows it's seen in the past uh 15 years on that Friday. And I think a lot of us bought the dip last Friday, not this Friday because this Friday we closed at all time highs, but la or no it wasn't last Friday, it was last Wednesday when things got really rocky and um you had like poundry go to 169, Nvidia go to 177 like like people ended up buying the dip and I think those dip buyers are going to be rewarded because essentially based on what we've heard today, it looks like we got a deal.</p>
</details>

这是今天早上Bent的一段视频，强调了这个协议可能真的要发生了。“这是我与我的中方对口官员，副总理何立峰的第五次会晤，我们讨论了广泛的问题，我认为我们已经为两位领导人下周四在韩国的会晤达成了一个实质性的框架。总统威胁说如果中国实施稀土全球出口管制，他将征收100%的关税，这给了我最大的筹码。所以我认为我们已经避免了这种情况。因此，关税将被避免，我们与中方有定期的季度会议。我们同意了这一点。我们还同意了大量购买美国农产品。我们同意中方将开始帮助我们处理导致这场可怕的芬太尼疫情的前体化学品。所以，总的来说，这是一次非常好的会议。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll talk more about the deal, but here's one video from Bent this morning highlighting that this deal uh might actually be happening. This was the fifth meeting that I've had with my Chinese counterpart, the vice premier Julie Fun, and we covered a wide range of issues and I think we've reached a substantial framework for the two leaders who will meet in Korea next Thursday. So, uh, you know, on the on the table, uh, the president had given me maximum leverage when he threatened 100% tariffs if the Chinese impose their rare earth uh, global export controls. So I think we have averted that. So the the tariffs will be averted and we have a regular meeting regular quarterly meeting uh with the Chinese. Uh it was scheduled for November 10th or before November 10th. I don't think we will have to have that. So uh we have been rolling the tariffs quarterly. So we agreed on that. We also agreed on substantial agriculture purchases for US farmers. We agreed that the Chinese would begin to help us uh with the precursor chemicals for this terrible fentanyl epidemic that's ravaging our country. So I would say that it was a very good meeting overall.</p>
</details>

好的，所以你听到Bent说这是一次非常好的会议。还有更多片段，我们会讨论Bent和Greer等人的言论。但甚至中国方面，中国大使馆发推文列出了三点，他们同意充分利用中美经贸磋商机制，就各自关切的经贸领域问题保持密切沟通，推动经贸关系健康、稳定、可持续发展，造福两国，为全球繁荣做出贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So you got Bent saying it was a very good meeting overall. There's a bunch more clips and we'll talk about uh some of those clips from Bent and Greer and all those guys. But dude, even the Chinese and again we're going to go real deep into this story. We got three minutes until the overnight markets open. But the Chinese embassy tweeted that uh these three bullet points that they have agreed to make full use of the China US economic and trade consultation mechanism, maintain close communication on respective concerns in the economic and trade fields and promote the healthy, stable, sustainable uh healthy and stable development of economic and trade relations to benefit both countries and contribute to global prosperity.</p>
</details>

这听起来不像贸易战。这三点，是中国大使馆今天逐字逐句发布的推文，感觉不像贸易战，不像中国讨厌美国或美国讨厌中国。看起来，尽管我们还没有正式协议，但Bent和何立峰已经为协议的框架奠定了谈判基础。而这个框架有望在11月1日特朗普与习会晤时确立。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean that does not sound like a trade war. those three bullet points right there which is word for word what the Chinese embassy tweeted today uh does not feel like a trade war it does not feel like China hates the US or the US hates China it looks like and again we don't have a deal but Bent and Lee set up the negotiations for what a framework for a deal would look like and that framework for a deal is going to be established uh hopefully on November 1st when Trump meets with Xi or I think it's it's October 30th it's it's in that in that time frame October 30th to November 1st that they're meeting.</p>
</details>

如果我们能达成任何合理的结论，再加上美联储降息，以及财报表现远超人们预期——到目前为止，标普500指数中80%已公布财报的公司都超出了盈利预期。这意味着利润率在上升。我想我们要上涨了，这很令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and look if we come to any reasonable conclusion and you've got the Fed rate cut and you've got a earnings coming in in a you know a much better way than people have expected. I mean so far 80% of the companies that have reported in the S&P 500 have beat on earnings. We looked at on Thursday whether it was Intel or Deckers and maybe their stocks didn't cooperate because a lot of those stocks were already up a lot year to date but the companies beat by an average of like 15 to 25% on EPS on earnings which means margins are going up. I mean I think we're going higher. I think we are going higher and it is exciting to see.</p>
</details>

### 市场反应：逢低买入策略再次奏效

现在，我在聊天室里快速发起一个投票：是继续上涨还是“利好出尽是利空”？当然，也可能出现“利好出尽是利空”的情况。我们周五确实收于历史高点。标普指数很可能在接下来的两分钟内开在接近680的水平。但即使是“利好出尽是利空”，那也意味着可以“逢低买入”。就像今年每一次机会一样，都是逢低买入的机会。我认为这一点不会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here's the poll I'll put real quick in the chat. Higher or sell the news. Higher or sell the news. I mean, there's a world where it could be a sell the news. That could definitely happen. We did close at an all-time high uh on Friday. Uh S&P likely opens up, I think, closer to that 680 level in the next two minutes. But if it is a sell the news, dude, it's also going to be a buy the dip. like every single thing this year, every single opportunity that we've had has been a buy the dip. And I don't think that necessarily changes.</p>
</details>

现在，问题在于那些在过去几周经历了大幅回调的动量股。我不知道它们是否会回到历史高点。也许有可能。但即使它们不回去，这也不是最疯狂的想法，对吧？因为一些经历回调的股票，也许回调已经足够了。很多股票下跌了30-40%，现在它们可以继续上涨，即使没有回到历史高点，或者它们可以在一个区间内稳定下来，这对于那些即使在下跌40%后年内仍上涨了5到7倍的股票来说，是你能期望的最好的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the the question around a lot of those momentum stocks that took a meaningful draw down over the past couple weeks, uh I don't know if they're going back to all-time highs. Maybe that's possible. But even if they don't, again, it's not the craziest idea, right? Because some of those stocks that did take a draw down, maybe that draw down is enough. And a lot of those stocks, you know, got hit 30, 40%. and now they can go higher even if they don't get back to all-time highs or they can stabilize in a range which is one of the best things you could ask for for stocks that are up five to 7x for the year even after that 40% decline.</p>

所以我认为过去几周发生的事情有很多健康的成分，尽管对我们所有人来说都很痛苦。但每一次出现任何程度的痛苦，我们做了什么？我们逢低买入，或者至少大部分散户都逢低买入了。我认为这种情况会继续上演。而且，这不仅仅是为了逢低买入而逢低买入，而是因为财报的势头持续证明逢低买入是合理的。感觉标普500指数7000点可能因为这种逢低买入的能力而成为可能。

<p class="english-text">So I think there's a lot of healthy components to what has happened over the past couple of weeks even though it was painful for all of us to deal with. But again, every time there's been any level of pain, what do we do? We bought the dip or at least the majority of retail bought the dip. And I think that has continued to play out. And again, it's not just buying the dip for the hell of buying the dip. It's because the earnings momentum that is out there continues to prove that buying the dip makes sense. And it feels like 7,000 S&P 500 might be in play because of that ability to buy the dip.</p>

AMD closed at 253 last week. 25. Google right there, 261. We saw Google get to 260 a while ago. So, I'm happy I bought another 500 shares on Friday. Let's see if we can get to 35 um on these earnings on Tuesday. SoFi right there 2963. Amazon up 1% 226. Meta 744. Haven't seen Meta at 740 since September.</p>

SPY（标普500 ETF）在哪里？天哪，680。我的天。我想我们都感觉它会开在那个价位附近。它周五收在678。SoFi 30。Palantir 187。上周在172逢低买入了Palantir。还在177逢低买入了英伟达。如果你在几乎所有股票上都逢低买入，你可能都做得不错。

Palanteer 187. Boom. Bought the dip at 172 on Palanteer last week. Also bought the dip at 177 on Nvidia. I mean, if you bought the dip on pretty much everything, you're probably doing well.</p>

伙计们，这可能是一次融涨（melt-up），一次真正严重的融涨。也许这次融涨的开端更健康，因为我们整个市场已经经历了一点回调，对吧？我们不是从673直接到680，而是从673跌到647，有些股票跌得更惨，但几乎所有股票都至少下跌了5%。市场下跌了3%，现在感觉以一种更健康的方式达到了这些水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Guys, this might be a meltup. This might be a real serious meltup. ... Yeah, and maybe it's a healthier start to another meltup because we already had a little bit of a draw down across the entire market, right? It's it's not like we're going from 673 to 680. We went from 673 to 647 and some names got hit worse than others, but pretty much everything took at least like minimum 5% hit. A lot of things took way worse than 5% of a hit. The market took a 3% hit and now it feels like a more healthier way to get to these levels. It really does, which is which is nice to see.</p>

中国股票怎么样？BABA（阿里巴巴）上涨2.9%。JD（京东）上涨2.74%。K Webb（中国互联网科技ETF）上涨了2%，这是一个很大的涨幅。

稀土股是红的。这很公平。US AR下跌13%，MP下跌5%。好吧，我想，很明显，如果你和中国达成了稀土金属和矿产的贸易协议，那么很多国内的生产商和矿商的需求就不会那么大了，对吧？或者至少感觉上他们的需求会下降一点。所以这很公平。黄金也下跌了1.32%。

<p class="english-text">The rare earth stocks are red. That is fair. US AR, my goodness, down 13%. MP's down 5%. Okay, I guess. Oh, well obviously I mean if you have a trade deal with China for rare earth metals and minerals, a lot of the domestic manufacturers and miners for those stocks, they're not going to have that much demand, right? Or at least the perception is their demand is going to go down a little bit. So that's fair. Gold is also down 1.32.</p>

### 展望未来：财报周与AI的持续影响

本周我们有什么安排？让我们来看看一些财报。顺便说一下，我想给你们看这个。**巴菲特指标**（Buffett Indicator，衡量股市总市值与国民生产总值GDP的比率）现在是223%。这意味着，如果你使用巴菲特指标，理论上这是历史上最昂贵的股市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what do we have this week? Let's transition into some of the earnings we have. By the way, I want to show you guys this real quick. The Warren Buffett indicator is now at 200 um 23%. Which means if you use the Buffett indicator, this is the most expensive stock market in history theoretically.</p>
</details>

当然，巴菲特指标在过去几年里一直很高，这有很多原因，但其中一个可以肯定的是人工智能和利润率的扩张，而伯克希尔哈撒韦公司并没有真正充分投资于此。我认为伯克希尔仍然有大约3500亿美元的现金，所以他们仍在等待机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, the Buffet indicator has been pretty much this high over the past couple years. uh not literally at this level but it's been you know getting to those all-time highs or close to those all-time highs and the reason for that is because our GDP as a our GDP relative to our stock market is is is in contrast right we are growing but we are not growing as fast as the stock market is growing but the reason the stock market is growing that much I mean there's a lot of reasons but one could definitely argue that AI and the margin expansion something that Birkshshire has not really been you know that fully invested in I think Bergkshire still has about 350 billion in cash so they are still waiting for an opportunity</p>
</details>

这个周末我们看到一个新闻标题，我认为这种情况会继续发生。奥利奥（Oreo）的制造商已经训练了自己的视频模型用于电视广告。他们在这些模型和人工智能上投资了4000万美元，并表示这使制作成本降低了30%到50%。视频模型正以惊人的速度发展。到明年，将很难分辨一个广告是否是人工智能生成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The makers of Oreo have trained their own video model for television advertising. They have invested 40 million in the models in AI and say it's cut production costs by 30 to 50%. Video models are continuing to advance at a rapid pace. By next year, it'll be difficult to tell if an ad is AI generated.</p>
</details>

这可能是很多公司一个有趣的财报看点。这些公司正在使用人工智能，人工智能降低了他们的成本。由于成本降低，他们能够实现更高的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share，每股收益）。由于EPS更高，股市继续扩大其整体估值，因为这些公司表明他们可以为股东创造更多价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This might actually be an interesting earning play for a lot of people to look at. ... But that could also be another consistent trend we're seeing in some of these companies. They're using AI. That AI is reducing their cost. As a result of reducing that cost, they're able to put up more EPS. As a result of putting up more EPS, the stock market continues to expand its overall multiple because these companies are showing that they can deliver more value for shareholders.</p>
</details>

然后周三将会是疯狂的一天。周三，我们有Meta、微软和亚马逊（应为谷歌）。你们认为周三哪家公司会从今天的价格上表现最好，是Meta、谷歌还是微软？我甚至不知道那天我们该怎么听财报电话会议。那将是疯狂的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Wednesday is going to be crazy. So here's my question. Let's uh let's put this in the chat. Wednesday, we have Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. By the way, 75% of you think that we're going to get that China deal done by end of year, which I would tend to agree with. I think we're in the closest level that we could possibly get that deal. Which one outperforms from these prices today, Meta, Google, or Microsoft on Wednesday? I don't even know how we're going to listen to the earnings calls that day. It's going to just be a wild day trying to get through all these stocks, but it's going to be exciting to see.</p>
</details>

说实话，我同意你们的看法。我认为是谷歌。我认为微软会很棒，但他们在云收入方面上个季度确实超出了预期，我不知道他们能否做到两次。谷歌有很多不同的因素在起作用，我可以看到它的EPS超出预期的可能性更大。至于Meta，我认为会不错，但我认为Meta内部存在一些混乱，扎克伯格将不得不清理这一切，并证明他们疯狂的支出是合理的。我认为谷歌是最清晰的，不会太差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, yeah, you know, honestly, I think I would I would I would agree with you guys. I think it's I think it's Google. I think Microsoft's going to be great. Uh, I do think Microsoft in their cloud revenue, you know, they really blew away expectations last quarter. I don't know if they can do that twice. Google has a lot of different elements working for it that I could see that EPS beat being higher than expected. And then Meta, I think, is going to be fine. I just think there's been a little bit of internal chaos in meta from all the stuff we've been seeing. And I think Z is just going to have to, you know, clean all that up and he's going to have to show that they might be spending like crazy, but it's justified. I think Google is the clearest though to to not be too bad.</p>

### 结论：牛市情绪持续，未来可期

我正在寻找看空的理由，但我不知道是否有一个简单的看空理由。现实地说，过去五个月自从关税事件以来，就没有出现过看空的理由。有一些令人担忧的看空因素，但最大的看空理由就是有很多股票的上涨可能不是基于最基本面的原因，但所有这些股票都经历了回调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm looking for the bare case. I don't know if there's an easy bare case, and realistically, there hasn't been a bare case for the past five months, ever since the tariff stuff. There are bearish things to be concerned about and to not worry about. And I think the biggest bearish case was just like there was a lot of stocks running for like probably not the most fundamental reason, but all those took a draw down.</p>
</details>

很多这种泡沫已经被挤出去了。可能还有一些局部感觉过热，但已经不像一个月前那么疯狂了。鉴于大量泡沫被挤出，市场已经能够走高，那些股票现在能够以更健康的方式上涨。我不知道还有什么能阻止它。美联储要加息吗？他们不会加息。那是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they all are probably not going to zero. Like they don't need to go to zero, and they have enough potential to justify why people would be excited to buy the dip on them. It's just they're also not going to the moon while the market was being flat, which was happening a month ago. And that as all I think pretty much all of it has been flushed out. There's probably still some pockets of it that feel toppy. But it's it's not as crazy as it was SoFi back above 30 when the meme stock ETF came out. When that ETF came out, I mean, a lot of people I remember the sentiment that they just felt like this was getting a bit ridiculous. I think a lot of that a lot of that has been flushed out and and given a lot of that flush out has happened and the market's been able to make a higher move and those stocks are now able to go higher in a more healthy way. I don't know what what has to be the what the Fed's going to hike. The Fed's not hiking. That's not happening.</p>

只要我们有中国协议、英伟达协议以及所有其他事情，比如特朗普周末说的与印度的协议也更近了一步。你有很多可以被市场消化的利好。此外，我们接近年底了。年底市场平均上涨4.7%。鉴于10月份出现了我们都预期的回调，如果市场需要一些波动，我们过去几周已经经历过了。也许这让我们能够迈向下一个台阶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then if we got the China deal and the Nvidia deal and all this other stuff or not the Nvidia deal, the the the well technically the Nvidia deal of Nvidia being able to sell chips to China, but the India deal which Trump said over the weekend they're closer to potentially getting into a conversation with that. I mean you just have a lot of stuff that can be baked. Also, we're near the end of the year. end of the year, markets are up on average 4.7%. And by the way, the reason the market tends to be good towards the end of the year is because September and August tend to suck. So the market kind of rallies towards the end of the year. September and August were really good. Guess what sucked? October to an extent, right? Now that we're recovering, but uh given October had that draw down that we were all anticipating where it was going to happen September, August, now that that's happened, you know, if the market needed some level of volatility, we got it over the past couple of weeks. And maybe maybe that allows us to make that next leg up.</p>
</details>

总之，主题是看涨的。我认为这次看涨更具可持续性，因为我们经历了一次健康的为期两周的全盘回调，我们可能都需要在获得收益之前看到更多的痛苦。这很自然。我们之前一直处于连胜状态。从四月到九月底，我们一直处于连胜状态。几乎没有什么能让我们下跌。然后因为特朗普说他厌倦了中国的出口管制，市场就下跌了3%。这几乎就像市场只是需要一个催化剂。而大多数人只是说：“好吧，如果这就是让我以25美元买到SoFi的催化剂，那我就这么做。”这就是为什么这也相当令人兴奋。

<p class="english-text">So, I mean again the theme of the day and hopefully the theme of tonight's future show continues into tomorrow. Look at Robin Hood 14338 is bullish. And the reason I really think this is more bullish is because we went through a healthy two week draw down across the entire board and all of us probably needed to see a little bit of more pain before we get those gains. It's just natural. We were going on a hot streak. Literally from April till the end of September, we're on a hot streak. And granted, we had a 30% decline, but the point is it was just up and up and up and up. And I ran Israel didn't take us down. Moody's didn't take us down. Trump announced 50% tariffs on the EU that didn't do anything. And then a 3% down day because Trump says, "Oh, I'm tired of China's uh export controls." And then boom, everything goes to It's almost like the market just needed a catalyst. And most people just said, "Okay, if that's the catalyst for me to get SoFi at $25, then that's what I'm going to do or pick whatever stock at whatever level." And that's why this is also pretty exciting.</p>
