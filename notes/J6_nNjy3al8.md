**Oliver Shu**: Welcome to part three of our 2026 big idea series. Oliver Shu explores how autonomous labs and AI are revolutionizing scientific discovery and changing how we conduct research and accelerate breakthroughs. Brian Kim reveals how AI is evolving beyond mere productivity tools to become the connective tissue and consumer applications, transforming how we interact and engage. And David Haber discusses how AI is reinforcing business models, creating compounding advantages that separate leaders from followers.

**Oliver Shu**: 我是Oliver Shu，A16Z美国动力团队的合伙人。我的大创意是，AI推理能力和机器人学习的进步将通过推动我们向**自主实验室**迈进，来帮助加速科学进步。实验室自动化已经存在很长时间了，这并不是什么新鲜事。就是那种你可以预先编程机器人来协助完成实验室某些操作的想法。现在新兴的是**推理能力**与**实验规划**以及实验室自动化的物理元素的结合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

My name is Oliver Shu. I'm a partner on the American Dynism team here at A16Z. And my big idea is that advances in AI reasoning capabilities and in robot learning will help accelerate scientific progress by moving us closer towards autonomous labs. Laboratory automation is something that's existed for a long time. Like that is not new. This idea of having robots that you can pre-program to assist in some of the motions involved in a lab. What is new and what is emerging right now is the combination of reasoning capabilities um and experiment planning and uh the physical element of lab automation. So

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 在不久的将来，这可能看起来像是科学家与一个包含AI应用和机器人的系统之间的协作。这将是一个更具协作性的过程，在不久的将来，在许多不同类型的实验室和许多不同类型的科学过程中，无论是在生命科学、化学工业还是材料科学研究领域等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

what that might look like in the near term is collaboration between a scientist and a system that involves both an AI application and a robot. Um and having that be a much more collaborative process uh in the near term in many different kinds of labs and many different kinds of scientific processes whether that's in the life sciences in the chemicals industry in the material science uh research sphere uh and so on and so forth. One of the

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 然而，我认为在不久的将来很重要的一点是关于**可解释性**。所以，如果你把AI系统看作是非确定性计算机，那么对于研究来说，真正重要的是你想要真正理解系统为什么会这样做，为什么它会以某种方式规划迭代一个实验，为什么它会计划做这个特定的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

things that I think is important in the near term though is around interpretability. So, you know, if you think about AI systems as non-deterministic computers, one of the things that really matters for research is you want to really understand why the system is doing what it's doing, why it's planning on uh iterating on an experiment in a given way, why it's

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 我认为，为科学研究而专门构建的系统可能会非常关注这一点——关注可解释性，记录在与人类科学家协作的每个步骤中究竟发生了什么。我认为，这种完全的“**自动驾驶科学**”的概念，对吧？就像一个闭环，AI会自我迭代，然后执行一个实验，然后继续在没有人为干预的情况下进行迭代。我认为这还需要一些时间。这就是我所说的，对于“自主科学”这个想法，这就是目的地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

planning on doing this particular thing. And I think uh you know systems that are purpose-built for scientific research are probably going to focus a lot on that on the interpretability on recording what exactly is is uh is happening throughout each step of the process as it collaborates with a human scientist. I think this concept of fully self-driving science, right, like a a closed loop where you have AI that iterates on itself and then carries out an experiment, then continues to to to iterate without human intervention. I think this is further out. This is what

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 我认为我们现在正处于为自主科学奠定基础的阶段。如果你把科学广义地看作是理论、计算和实验的某种结合，那么在AI生态系统中，在数学推理、物理推理、模拟和世界模型以及机器人学习等领域都有工作正在进行。所有这些随着能力的提高，最终都可以应用于闭环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I would consider the destination uh for this idea of of autonomous science. I think where we are right now is that there's a lot of work being done uh to form the foundations of autonomous science and there uh if you consider science as you know broadly speaking some combination of theory of computation and of experimentation there's work being done in the AI ecosystem across areas like mathematical reasoning uh physical reasoning simulation and world models and robot learning and all of these things

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 当然，所有这些领域的进展是不均衡的，你必须等待这些能力达到可以应用于闭环的程度。我认为那就是目的地，而在不久的将来，我们会逐步在实验室自动化和这方面的推理方面取得进展。但最终的目的地，我认为将围绕着“**自驾实验室**”或自主科学这个想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

eventually as these capabilities improve can be applied to uh closing this loop. But progress across all these fields is of course uneven and you kind of have to wait for the capabilities to get to the point where um they're ready to be applied to this close this closed loop and I think that's the destination and in the near term incrementally we'll make progress on you know lab automation on the reasoning pieces of this um but uh ultimately the final destination I

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 这部分将由研究进行的市场动态驱动。我认为，有些科学领域对其研究成果的需求端市场更为成熟，例如生命科学和制药、化学工业以及材料科学研究领域。我认为这些领域有现成的、愿意购买大量研究成果的买家。研究速度和能力的提升，以及可能出现的任何成本优势。所有这些都将在拥有成熟研究成果买家的市场中变得更加重要。因此，我认为自主实验室和自主科学的首次应用，很可能更多地取决于其运营的市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

think would be around this idea of a of of a self-driving lab or of autonomous science part of this is going to be driven by the market dynamic uh in which the research is conducted. So I think there are certain categories of science where there is just a much more mature uh demand side market for the outputs of research and examples include of course life sciences and pharma um the chemicals industry um facets of the uh material science industry. I think these are areas where there is a ready uh and willing buyer for a lot of the outputs of this research and the uh this the increase in speed and capability uh as well as any cost advantage that might um that might occur. All of these things are going to matter more to uh for markets where there is a well-established buyer of of of research output. And so I think the

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 我认为**Periodic Labs**是一个很好的例子，它是一个团队在自主科学方面的一次尝试。当你审视早期创业公司时，有像**Medra**这样的公司专注于生命科学和制药市场。有像**Chemifi**和**Yona Labs**这样的公司专注于化学工业。然后，稍微放眼全局，政府和行业之间存在合作，专注于AI和科学的交叉领域。你知道，有**能源部**领导的**Genesis Mission**，汇集了学术界、政府、国家实验室以及领先的AI公司，以推进AI驱动的科学。我认为就在今天，**DeepMind**宣布与英国政府建立合作伙伴关系，以在科学发现领域进行合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

where you see autonomous labs and autonomous science being adopted first is probably more of a function of the market that um that that that it's operating in. I think periodic labs is a great example of uh of a team taking a swing um at uh at autonomous science. I think you know when you look at the early stage startup landscape there's companies like Medra that are focused on the life sciences and uh pharma market. There's companies like uh Chemifi and Yona Labs that are focused on the uh on on the chemistry industry. Um and then there's zooming out a bit there's collaborations between government and industry that are really focused on this intersection of AI and science. uh you know there is the genesis mission led by the department of energy uh that brings together you know academia, government and the national labs as well as uh leading AI companies uh to pursue AIdriven science. I think just today

</details>

**Oliver Shu**: 所以我认为，有初创公司在进行实验室自动化工作。有初创公司在构建AI科学家。而这些工作正在更广泛的公共部门、私营部门和学术界合作的背景下进行，以真正加速AI驱动的科学发现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

DeepMind announced a partnership with the UK government um to collaborate on areas of scientific discovery. So I think there's, you know, there's startups that are working on lab automation. There's startups that are working on building an AI scientist and that work is happening against the backdrop of a broader collaboration between both the public sector and the private sector in academia to really accelerate AIdriven scientific discovery.

### AI连接人心的力量

**Brian Kim**: 大家好，我是Brian Kim，A16Z AI应用投资团队的合伙人。2026年将是主要的**消费级AI应用产品**从生产力（帮助你工作）转向连接性（帮助你保持联系）的一年。AI不再仅仅是帮助你工作，而是让你能更清晰地认识自己，并帮助你与你爱的人建立联系。AI在生产力方面非常有用。我认为我们将开始看到AI实际占据比传统产品更多的关注度和时间，而不是AI生产力工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Hi, I'm Brian Kim. I'm a partner at A16Z's AI applications investing team. 2026 marks the year where major consumer AI application products shift from productivity, helping you work to connectivity, helping you stay connected. Instead of helping you just do work, AI allows you to see yourself clearly and help build relationship with people you love. AI has been incredibly useful for productivity. And I think

</details>

**Brian Kim**: 会有人利用它来真正增强并获得他们感觉需要的来自他人的数字连接。我认为会有一群人真正利用AI来促进他们现有的线下人际关系。我们都是社会性动物，我相信AI在帮助我们与他人保持联系，并帮助我们感觉被他人看见方面，发挥着真正的作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

we'll we'll start seeing AI actually take more mind share and time from traditional products versus AI productivity tools. There will be folks who use it to really augment and actually get that connection that they feel that they need from others digitally. I think there will be a group of people who really use AI to facilitate their existing relationships in person. We're all social animals and

</details>

**Brian Kim**: 初创公司能否与大型平台竞争？这些平台拥有用户基础和网络。AI带来了一种全新的用户交互方式，这可能难以复制，并且可能无法原生存在于这些产品的平台中。只要存在全新的用户交互模式，只要存在全新的创意出口和与现有平台不同的原子单元，我坚信初创公司绝对可以获胜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I believe AI has a real place in helping us stay connected with others and help us feel like we're seen by others. Can startups compete with the large incumbent platforms? The incumbents have the platform, they have the network. AI brings a net new user interaction that may be difficult to replicate and may not natively live in the platforms of

</details>

**Brian Kim**: 越来越多地，我们与AI分享我们内心生活的更多内容。我真正兴奋的是，人们愿意分享的意愿正在随着AI而加深。当我和我的AI，你的AI，我的“家伙”和你的“家伙”交谈，说：“看看，你有没有关注他？你想谈谈ABC吗？” 我认为这将开启全新的关系，全新的对话，否则我们不会有。我非常期待AI最终能帮助人们被他人看见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the product. And in so far as there are net new user interaction models, in so far as there's net new creative outlets and atomic units that look different from what's available in current platforms, my strong belief is that startups can absolutely win. Increasingly, we're sharing so much more of our inner life with AI. What I get really excited about is people's willingness to share is deepening with AI. What happens when I'm okay with my AI coming to your AI, my guy talking to your guy and say, "Look, have you checked in on him? Do you want to talk about ABC?" I think those would be an

</details>

**Brian Kim**: 消费产品领域的口号是，永远要努力解决核心情感。这里的核心情感是渴望被看见，渴望与他人建立联系。要实现第一步，我认为AI产品能够理解你是谁会很有帮助。那么问题来了，在你不讲述自己人生故事的情况下，什么机制能让产品快速了解你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

opener for net new relationship, net new conversations that we wouldn't have otherwise. And I'm very excited for AI to actually finally help people be seen by others. The mantra in consumer products is look always try to actually address the core emotion. The core emotion again here is wanting to be seen, wanting to feel connected to

</details>

**Brian Kim**: 也许是摄取你的数字足迹。也许是摄取你在线上或线下谈论过的一些内容。也许是查看你的照片卷。通过人工智能或生成式AI，我们迎来了一波新的公司，它们真正帮助你更好地工作、更好地思考，并更容易地获取信息。我们已经见证了今天AI的惊人革命。我真正兴奋的是下一步是什么，以及可以做什么。我非常期待思考下一系列将开始解决并帮助人们感觉被他人看见的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

others. And in order for the first step to happen, I think it's it's helpful for the AI product to be able to understand who you are. So then the question is what would be the best mechanism for a product to understand you quickly without you narrating your life story. Perhaps it's ingestion of your digital footprint. Perhaps it's ingestion of some of the things that you talked about online or offline. Perhaps it's looking through your photo roll. With artificial intelligence or Gen AI, we have a net new wave of companies that really help you do work better, think better, and get information easier. We have been blessed by an incredible revolution in AI today. What I get really excited about is what is the next steps and what can be done. I get very excited to think about the next suite of products that would start addressing and helping people feel like they're being seen by others.

### AI强化商业模式

**David Haver**: 大家好，我是David Haver，A16C的普通合伙人，我负责领导AI应用基金。我对2026年的大创意是寻找那些AI能够**强化其商业模式**的公司。我认为有很多关于AI帮助自动化工作和降低成本的说法。但在AI实际强化商业模式并驱动收入的实例中，客户可能愿意采用该技术的程度几乎没有上限。因此，这类案例的市场拉力，比仅仅是成本削减的故事要强得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Hey, I'm David Haver, general partner here at A16C and I help co-lead the AI apps fund. My big idea for 2026 is looking for companies where AI reinforces the business model. You know, I think there's a lot of narrative around AI helping automate work and reducing cost. But I think in instances where AI is actually reinforcing the business model in driving revenue, there's really no limit to the amount that customers may want to adopt that technology. And so the market pull in examples like that are just, you know, so much stronger than than those where it's just a cost reduction story. I sit

</details>

**David Haver**: 我是**EVE**这家公司的董事会成员，该公司在原告法律领域运营。原告律师的独特之处在于，他们不按小时收费，而是按**风险代理**（contingency basis）收费，这意味着他们只有在胜诉时才能获得报酬。因此，虽然AI正在帮助他们自动化许多起草和推理工作，但最终它真的能让他们承接更多客户并赚取更多收入。所以它不会侵蚀计费小时数，而是真正强化了他们的商业模式。因此，EVE这类AI工作空间的市场拉力一直非常巨大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

on the board of a company called EVE, which operates in the plaintiff law space. And what's unique about plaintiff law is that those attorneys don't charge by the hour. They operate on a contingency basis, which which means that they only get paid if they win. And so again, while AI is helping automate a lot of the drafting and reasoning work that they do, ultimately it's it's really about enabling them to take on more clients and make more money. So it doesn't erode, you know, the billable hour. It really reinforces their business model. And as a result, the

</details>

**David Haver**: 我们投资组合中的另一个例子是**Salient**公司，它在贷款服务领域运营。他们将语音代理应用于，最初是汽车贷款，但现已扩展到整个消费贷款产品生态系统。在那里，语音代理可以用50种语言进行交流，完全合规地跟踪UDAP（《统一数据访问协议》），进行欢迎电话和付款提醒。当然，这其中有成本降低的因素，它有助于提高许多银行和非银行贷款机构的效率，这些机构拥有大型呼叫中心。但他们发现，最 remarkable 的是，语音代理实际上正在提高**收款率**。所以，这不仅仅是成本降低的故事，它实际上为他们的终端客户带来了更好的结果。因此，它强化了贷款机构的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

market pull for Eve's kind of AI workspace has just been tremendous. Another example in our portfolio is a company called Salient which operates in the uh loan servicing space. So they're applying voice agents to they started in uh auto lending but they've expanded to a whole ecosystem of kind of consumer lending products where you know a voice agent can speak in 50 languages fully compliantly track UDAP do welcome calls and payment reminders and obviously you know there is a cost reduction story in that right it is helping drive efficiencies in many of these bank and non-bank lenders who have large call centers but I think what's what they found which is so remarkable is that the voice agents are actually driving better collection rates, right? So, it's not just a cost reduction story. It's actually delivering, you know, better outcomes, you know, for their end customers. And as a result, um, it's reinforcing, you know, the lender

</details>

**David Haver**: 最终，AI应用的**复利竞争优势**的来源在哪里？我认为EVE是一个非常独特的例子和案例研究。最终，EVE的创始人有一个愿景，就是拥有从客户引入到最终结果的端到端工作流程。我认为，将自己深深地嵌入客户之中，让他们每天都生活在产品中，是防御的来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

business model. Ultimately, where did the sources of compounding competitive advantage, you know, reside in in AI applications and I think Eve is a really, uh, unique kind of example and case study for this. You know, ultimately the founders of Eve had a vision for, you know, owning the kind of endto-end workflow from intake, you know, to outcome. And I think you know deeply embed embedding yourself within your customer having them you know live within the product you know every day as a source of defensibility. I think

</details>

**David Haver**: 他们还在创建一个真正独特的数据资产。最终，通过能够处理从客户引入到结果的案例，这些结果数据不是公开的，不是模型公司和实验室可以在公共互联网上训练的数据源。因此，最终这些结果数据被用来更好地指导更智能的客户引入，以便EVE可以告诉他们的客户：“看，这个案例具有这些特征，可能价值5万美元。这个案例可能价值500万美元。以下是你可能想要如何分配你的劳动力和时间。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

they're also creating a a really unique data asset, right? Ultimately by being able to process cases again from intake all the way to outcomes that outcomes data is not public, right? That is not a source of information that you know model companies and labs can actually train on and you know on the public internet. And so, you know, ultimately that that outcomes data is is used to better inform smarter intake so that Eve can tell their their customers, look, this case has these characteristics to potentially be worth, you know, $50,000.

</details>

**David Haver**: 考虑到交易对手，你可能想在需求信函中加入哪些特征，以实现更好的结果？因此，我认为EVE处理的案例越多，平台就会变得越智能、越强大。再次强调，最终强化了其客户的商业模式，因为他们只有在获胜时才能获得报酬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

This case is potentially worth $5 million. Here's how you may want to triage, you know, your labor and your time. And ultimately, you know, given this counterparty, you know, what are the characteristics that you may want to put into a demand letter to actually affect better outcomes? And so I think the more cases that EES processes, you know, the smarter and more powerful the platform becomes. Again, ultimately reinforcing the business model for their clients because, you know, they only get paid if they win.
