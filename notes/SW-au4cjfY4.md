### 中共精英政治的迷雾与历史的价值

**Joe Wisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听OddLots播客的又一期节目。我是Joe Wisenthal。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Wisenthal</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我是Tracy Aloway。Tracy，有时候我会读20世纪的中国历史，嗯……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, sometimes I read 20th century Chinese history and uh</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 有时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">sometimes</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 不，这里有我无法理解的东西。比如，你知道，我读到毛泽东时代或邓小平时代，所有那些形形色色的干部，他们都说：“哦，我们犯了‘**左倾机会主义**’（Left Deviationism: 政治上过于激进，脱离实际）或‘**右倾机会主义**’（Right Deviationism: 政治上过于保守，偏离革命路线），或者诸如此类的事情。”他们都非常担心自己是否会被开除之类的。我从来不知道这些词是什么意思。我真的觉得我对中共精英政治的运作方式没有任何直观的理解，我认为我可能应该了解，考虑到我们美国人对中国运作方式的认识日益增长的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, there's here's something I don't understand. Like, you know, I read about the Mao era or the Dang Xiaopang era and all the various cowgers, they're all like, "Oh, we're like guilty of like committed like a left deviationism or right deviationism or all this stuff." And they're all really worried about whether they're going to get expelled or something like that. And I never like know what any of these words mean. Like I actually feel like I have no intuitive understanding of how like elite level Chinese Communist Party politics works and I think I probably should given the sort of like growing stakes and the growing awareness with which we as Americans all have to be aware about how China works.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 等等，如果你读了很多中国历史书，你一定知道什么是**自我批评**（Self-criticism: 中共党内一种通过公开承认错误来巩固团结和思想统一的方式），对吧？我知道什么是批评，但我不知道他们为什么会说：“哦，你搞了**修正主义**（Revisionism: 偏离马克思主义基本原则的理论或实践），或者你搞了**超左主义**（Ultraleftism: 政治上比左倾机会主义更极端，主张采取超越现实条件的激进政策），或者你搞了**超右主义**（Ultrarightism: 政治上比右倾机会主义更极端，主张采取过于保守甚至反动的政策）。”我不知道这些术语是什么意思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, if you're reading lots of China history books, you must know what self-criticism is, right? I know what criticism is, but I don't know why they're like, "Oh, you engaged in revisionism or you engra engaged in ultralleftism or you engaged in ultrarightism." And I don't know what any of these terms mean.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，我了解的中国经验是，有时候规则是故意模糊的，对吧？这样就没有明确的定义，你就可以随意打击你想打击的人。你知道我如何学习中国历史吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, my experience of China is that sometimes the rules are a little sketchy on purpose, right? So that there isn't a clear definition so that you can kind of go after whoever you want. You know what I I do to learn about Chinese history?</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 告诉我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 中国历史剧。我挺喜欢它们的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chinese historical dramas. I kind of love them.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 你是指戏剧还是书籍？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you mean like plays or books or</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 不不，我指的是电视剧。可能相当于在美国看肥皂剧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, no. I mean uh TV shows. Probably the equivalent of watch soap operas in the States.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 你有最喜欢的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you have a favorite?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 哦，我正在看一部。我之后告诉你。太好看了。但我之所以提起它，是因为最近有一部历史剧是关于习近平的父亲的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I have one I'm watching right now. I'll tell you afterwards. It's so good. But the reason I bring it up is because relatively recently there was a historical drama that was all about Xihinping's father.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 哦，我见过一些截图。我想有人把它都上传到YouTube了。你看了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I saw some screenshots from that. I think someone like uploaded it all to you. Have you watched it?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 我没有。我一直在找，但没找到。所以，如果你在YouTube上找到了，告诉我。但我之所以提起它，是因为我们今天要和他的传记作者之一，第一位用英语撰写他传记的作者，谈论他的生平。这部剧本身在上映时受到了严厉批评，这很有趣。有一些评论说：“哦，我想今天的中国青年宁愿看《怪奇物语》，也不愿了解中共的历史。”所以，我们将在播客中努力让中共历史像《怪奇物语》一样有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I haven't. I I've been looking for it and I haven't been able to find it. So, if you find it on YouTube, let me know. But the reason I bring it up is cuz we're going to be speaking about his life today to the author of one of his biographies, the first English-speaking biography. And the series itself got panned when it came out. It was really funny. And there were some quotes that said, "Oh, I think Chinese youth today would rather watch Stranger Things than learn about the history of the CCP." So, we're going to try to make CCP history as interesting as Stranger Things on this podcast.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 我想我们也要向美国听众，也许还有一些正在收听的中国青年，说明学习这些历史是值得的，对吧？不管它是否有趣，就像，好吧，现在是2025年。我们是否需要重温**延安**（Yan'an: 中国共产党在抗日战争和解放战争时期的重要根据地）或**西北地区**（Northwest Provinces: 中国西北部地区，包括陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等地）的历史，或者其他所有这些东西？这真的重要吗？无论如何，我们显然请到了最合适的嘉宾。我们将与Joseph Torigian交谈。他是斯坦福大学**胡佛研究所**（Hoover Institution: 斯坦福大学的一个公共政策智库）的研究员，也是**美国大学**（American University: 位于华盛顿特区的一所私立大学）的副教授。他是一本新书《党的利益至上：习近平之父习仲勋的生平》的作者。Joseph，非常感谢您来到OddLots。

<p class="english-text">And we're also, I guess, going to make the case maybe to American listeners and maybe some Chinese youth if they're listening that it's worth learning about, right? Like whether it's interesting or not, it's like, okay, it's the year 2025. Do we need to like revisit the history and Yanan or the Northwest Provinces or whatever? All this stuff. Is this really important? Anyway, we obviously have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Joseph Trigan. He is a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and an associate professor at American University. And he is the author of a new book, The Party's Interests Come First: The Life of Xi Jang Shun, Father of Xihinping. Joseph, thank you so much for coming on OddLabs.</p>

### 学习习仲勋生平的意义

**Joe Wisenthal:** 为什么我们对习仲勋的生平感兴趣，或者说，为什么你，为什么任何人会感兴趣并值得花时间去了解他的生平？你知道，当我听你的谈话时，我想到习近平正在努力实现的目标之一，就是通过让人们学习党史来使政权永垂不朽。他认为，保持党的警惕、奉献和与人民团结一致的方法之一，就是学习革命者的遗产。因此，这段历史是什么，将这段历史作为道德教育来教授，是习近平工程的核心。这就引出了一个问题：那段历史究竟是什么？我试图通过他父亲的视角，在我的书中讲述它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why are we interested or I guess you Why were you Why is anyone interested and worth spending time to learn about the life of Xi Jang Shun? You know, while I was listening to your conversation, I was thinking about how one of the things that Xiinping is trying to achieve is make the regime immortal by having people study party history. He believes that one of the ways to keep the party vigilant and dedicated and at one with the people is to learn from the legacy of the revolutionary. So what that history is, teaching that history as moral education is at the very heart of Xiinping's project. So that begs the question, what was that history? And I tried to tell it through the prism of his own father with my book.</p>
</details>

### 早期中共党员的入党动机

**Tracy Aloway:** 所以我一直想问一位中共专家的问题是，为什么在1940年代、1950年代、1970年代会有人想加入共产党？我理解事后诸葛亮，但回过头看，首先，没有人知道这一切会如何发展。其次，作为一名普通党员，你的生活似乎非常非常艰难，在某些方面也非常危险，就像Joe提到的自我批评以及因左倾或右倾或其他什么而惹麻烦。这似乎不是一段愉快的时光。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one question I always wanted to ask a sort of CCP expert is why would anyone want to join the party in the sort of 1940s, 1950s, 1970s? I understand that hindsight is 2020, but looking back, first of all, no one knew how this was all going to turn out. And secondly, it seems like your life as a sort of minor party official could be very, very tricky and very dangerous in some ways to Joe's point about things like self-criticism and getting in trouble for leftist deviations or rightist deviations or whatever. It doesn't seem like a fun time.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以我认为把你的问题稍微分解一下会很有意义。你是在哪个十年加入党的，这能说明很多关于那个人的事情，而且你为什么留在党内，可能与你最初加入的原因非常不同，因为你常常不知道这是一个什么样的组织，也不知道接下来会发生什么。但我认为你问题的核心是，为什么你会加入一个如此危险的组织？无论是为了反抗一支实力悬殊的军队而进行革命，还是因为党内有如此多的权力斗争。其中一个答案是，对于这些人来说，共产主义不仅仅是一种理解经济的方式，不仅仅是关于马克思主义辩证法。它实际上是他们生命意义和目的的来源。他们加入了一个对他们来说是世界历史必然性的体现的组织，这令人兴奋。它给了他们能动性，让他们觉得自己的生命有意义。当然，他们常常在整个国家面临因军阀、土匪以及西方和日本侵略而分崩离析的危险时加入党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that breaking down your question a little bit would be meaningful. What decade you joined the party can tell you a lot about that person and also why you stay in the party can be very different from why you joined in the first place because often you don't know what kind of organization it is and you don't know what's going to be coming. But I think that at the heart of what you're getting at is why would you join an organization that is so dangerous to be a member of? Either because you're fighting a revolution against a vastly superior force or because there are so many power struggles within that party. One of the answers is that for these people, communism wasn't just a way of understanding economics. It wasn't just about Marxist dialectics. It was really a source of meaning and purpose in their lives. It was joining an organization that for them was a manifestation of a world historical inevitability and it was exciting. It it gave them agency. It gave them a sense that their lives mattered. And of course they were often joining the party at moments when they felt that the entire nation was at risk of falling apart because of warlords and bandits and western and Japanese encroachments.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 我忘了是哪个年代了。但还有另一个原因，即使是今天，人们也会对激进政治感到兴奋，那就是性和约会，他们认为这会让他们对异性更有吸引力。你在书中提到了这一点，说这是早期共产党员的吸引力之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I forget what decade it is. But there's another reason that even people today get excited about radical politics and that is sex and dating and they think it'll make them attractive to members of the opposite sex. You mentioned that in your book that that was one of the appeals for the very early communists.</p>
</details>

### 习仲勋的崛起与党内关系

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以政治和个人事务常常在中国共产党党员身上混合在一起，这很有趣。所以有政治背景，有社会背景。他出生在清朝灭亡两年后。他看到了民族主义者和土匪之间、民族主义者和共产主义者之间的所有这些战斗。对他来说，在这个地区长大，即使是视觉上也会很震撼，因为他在西安附近长大，你们很多听众一定知道那里是兵马俑的故乡。那是因为第一个统一的中华帝国就是在他的出生地附近铸就的。所以他会看到他的国家从唐朝的辉煌高度跌落了多远。所以对他来说，他并不真正理解意识形态的复杂性。他并不是从知识分子的角度被马克思主义吸引。但正如他和其他人后来所写或谈论的那样，变得更激进、更左倾，只是一种很酷的感觉，因为当时有一种感觉，国家真的需要一些激烈的变革才能站稳脚跟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's interesting how politics and the personal mix often for members of the Chinese Communist Party. So there was a political background, there was a social background. He was born 2 years after the collapse of theQing dynasty. He saw all of these battles between nationalists and bandits, nationalists and communists. And it would have been even just visibly striking for him to grow up in this area because he grew up near Xian which many of your listeners must know as where the Terracotta soldiers are from. And that's because the first unified Chinese state was forged near where he was born. And so he would have seen just how far his country had fallen from these amazing heights during the Tong dynasty. And so for him he didn't really understand the intricacies of the ideology. He wasn't really attracted to Marxism from an intellectual perspective. But as he and other people had written about or talked about later, it was just kind of cool to be more radical, more leftist because there was a sense that the country really needed something drastic to be able to find its feet.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 你能谈谈他早期是如何在党内晋升的吗？因为这总是一个问题。首先，正如你所说，共产党的奋斗目标总是在不断变化，或者说他们执行目标的方式似乎非常灵活。所以我很好奇，一个初级政治家或党员如何在党内获得影响力，以及什么才算是一份能让他们晋升的好工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you talk a little bit about how he rose up through the party ranks in the sort of early days because this is always a question. So first of all, the goal of the Communist Party as you mentioned is sort of always changing in one way or another or certainly the way they execute on it seems to be quite flexible. And so I'm very curious how a sort of junior level politician or party member gathers influence within the party and basically what qualifies as a good job to get them ahead.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的，这是一个很好的问题。所以我的书试图探讨的困境之一是，在一个如此强调强有力领导和纪律的体系中，成为一名副手意味着什么？所以人们可能会想，我为什么要读一本关于一个不是中国共产党最高领导人的人的书呢？这不就是一个人们只听命行事的组织吗？但实际上，它比那复杂得多。而且它之所以复杂，有很多有趣的原因。其中之一是，最高领导人通常会给出一个他们想实现目标的总体方向，但他们不会说哪些更重要，以及如何实现。所以副手必须自己想办法。他们必须忠于最高领导人的意愿，但也不能把所有事情都搞砸。还有其他竞争者可能不喜欢你。你还必须意识到，最高领导人常常会改变主意。所以所有这些都是党员必须处理的事情，而习仲勋因其能够不断赢得党内著名元老的支持而脱颖而出。所以他不是开国元勋中最年长的一批，但他能够一次又一次地找到这些“老大哥”，他们在他身上看到了他们欣赏的东西，这真的让你印象深刻。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's a great question. So, one of the dilemmas that my book tries to explore is what does it mean to be a deputy in a system that puts so much focus on a strong leader and discipline? So, people might wonder, why would I read a book about someone who wasn't the top leader of the Chinese Communist Party? Isn't this just an organization where people do what they're told? But actually, it's so much more complicated than that. And it's complicated for lots of interesting reasons. One is that the top leader often will give a general sense of what they want to achieve, but they won't say what matters more and how to achieve it. And then so the deputy has to figure it out. They have to be loyal to what the top leader wants, but also not screw everything up entirely. There's other competitors that might not like you. You also have to be aware of the fact that often the top leader will change their mind. So all of these things are what members of the party have to manage and Xi Jun stands out for his ability to keep winning over famous senior men within the party. So he was not one of the oldest of the founding generation, but he really impresses you with his ability to find these big brothers over and over again who saw something in him that they admired. Hm.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 我从阅读你的书中真正体会到的一点，你提到了习近平本人，作为他自身目标的一部分，就是让年轻一代更多地了解党史。因此，Tracy提到了那部电视剧。我从阅读你的书中真正深刻领会到的一点是，这个国家是多么年轻，这个党是多么年轻。我的意思是，从某种意义上说，毛泽东就像习近平的叔叔。我的意思是，你用“老大哥”这个词来形容习仲勋寻找这些“兄弟般的人物”的能力。这仍然是一个非常亲密的，一个非常亲密的家庭。这些人就像在最初的时候就在那里，习近平认识他们，并和他们一起长大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing I really got from reading your book and you mentioned Xihinping himself as part of his own goal is to have the younger generations learn more about party history. Hence the drama that Tracy mentioned. One thing I really sort of deeply internalized reading your book is how young the country is, how young the party is, and I mean there is a sense in which Mao is like Xiinping's uncle. I mean you say the word big brother in terms of like Xi Jang Shun's ability to find these sort of brother figures. It's still a very close It's a very close family. These people were like right there at the very beginning that Xiinping knew and was growing up with.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的。所以，我认为书中一个非常重要的点是，这些人彼此认识了多久，对吧？所以这本书始于1920年代，习仲勋是1990年代初期的主要人物，这些名字一次又一次地出现，他们彼此认识了这么久，这些关系的复杂性确实非同寻常。所以在西方，我们常常习惯于将党划分为好人和坏人、改革派和保守派、左派和右派。而我的研究中发现的一点是，他们彼此互动的方式非常微妙。所以他们某种程度上是“亦敌亦友”，对吧？他们都忠于党，但对抗和忠诚的转变方式，是非常多变的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, one of the things in the book that I think is really quite significant is how long these people knew each other, right? So the book begins in the 1920s and Xi Jang Shun's uh a major figure through the early 1990s and these names keep coming back over and over and over again and they they knew each other for so long and the intricacies of these relationships are really something. So in the west we've often seen this habit of dividing the party between good guys and bad guys, reformers and conservatives, leftists and rightists. And one of the things that emerges from my research is that they were so subtle the way they interacted with each other. So they were kind of fremies in a way, right? So they all had loyalty to the party, but the way that the antagonism shifted, the way that the loyalty shifted, it was something that was very prote.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 再多谈谈这一点，因为我认为当西方人听到中国共产党时，他们常常想到派系斗争，以及所有这些干部在秘密房间里组成不同的团体，有着不同的目标。这真的发生过吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talk a little bit more about that because I think when people certainly in the west hear about the Chinese Communist Party, they often think of factionalism and all these cadres that are sort of in secret rooms forming different groups with different goals. Did that actually happen?</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以，我对“派系”这个概念对于理解中国共产党有多大用处持怀疑态度。现在，我不想走得太远。你和谁一起工作，你是否在同一个组织工作，这些事情肯定很重要。但**列宁主义政党**（Leninist parties: 以列宁思想为指导，强调高度集中统一和严格纪律的政党）之所以被称为“组织武器”，是因为它们对领导人非常友好，而且对某些团体采取任何协同政治行动都存在禁忌。当然，有时他们会达到那种协调水平，但他们必须非常小心，因为一旦最高领导人发现，他们就会有大麻烦。但同时，人就是人。所以，你可能在某些问题上持有更自由的观点，在其他问题上持有更保守的观点。仅仅因为你和某人一起工作过，并不意味着你会喜欢他们。所以，通常那些人，正如我所说，这些关系是由几十年前发生的事情塑造的，他们记忆犹新。如果你和某人一起工作过，但相处不好，这在未来很多年里也可能很有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm a skeptic about how useful the idea of factions can be for understanding the Chinese Communist Party. Now, I don't want to go too far. It definitely matters who you worked with, whether you work in the same organization, that kind of thing. But the reason Leninist parties are known as organizational weapons is because they are so leader friendly and because there is such a taboo about any concerted political action by certain groups. Now, sometimes they approach that level of coordination, but they have to be so careful because as soon as the top leader identifies that, then they're going to be in big trouble. But also, people are people. So, you can have more liberal views on some issues, more conservative views on other issues. Just because you worked with someone doesn't mean that you're going to like them. So, often the people who are, as I mentioned, these relationships are shaped by what happened decades previously, they have long memories. And if you worked with someone, you didn't get along, that can be meaningful many, many, many years into the future, too.</p>

### “左倾”与“右倾”：中共意识形态术语解析

**Joe Wisenthal:** 我在开头提到了这一点，但我记得几年前读了邓小平的最新传记，以及周恩来的最新传记。他们总是试图揣摩毛泽东的心思，对吧？他们就像在想：“哦，我们是不是犯了左倾还是右倾错误？”我从来都搞不清楚我们是否采取了正确的路线？我们是否采取了人民的路线？诸如此类。左倾到底是什么意思？他们总是被指责为左倾。我以为他们都是左派，他们是共产主义者。但当他们说某人在中共采取了左倾路线，而且这在某种程度上是坏事时，他们到底是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mentioned this at the beginning, but I remember when I read the uh recent biography from a few years ago of Dun Sha Pang and then also a recent Joe and Lie biography. They're always like trying to read Ma's mind, right? Like they're on there like, "Oh, and are we guilty of leftism or rightism or whatever?" And I can never really figure out do we take the correct line? Do we take the people's line? Whatever. What does leftism mean? They're always getting accused of leftism. I thought they're all leftists. They're communists. But what is actual what did they mean it when they said that someone was taking like the leftist line in the CCP and that that was bad in some way.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 好问题。所以当你查看中文文本中谈论左倾和右倾时，左倾总是加引号的，对吧？那么什么是左倾呢？理论上，左倾基本上意味着你过于雄心勃勃。你前进得太快。你不认识客观条件，因此你把事情搞砸了，因为你试图实现当时不可能实现的目标。同时，左倾也是中国共产党的一部分，因为存在着一种被称为“运动”的现象，对吧？那么什么是运动呢？运动意味着你故意让人们走得太远，因为你需要他们走得太远，因为其目的就是鼓舞人心，让他们兴奋，激发热情。所以你期望事情会走得太远。现在对于这些副手来说，通常当他们走得太远，然后进行**整风**（Rectification: 中共党内通过批评与自我批评来统一思想、纠正错误、纯洁队伍的政治运动）时，他们不会因此受到惩罚，因为总是期望会出现一些错误，你会打破一些鸡蛋，对吧？然而，因为这是一个如此认真对待意识形态的体系，当出现意见分歧时，它们常常不被理解为意见分歧。它们被视为更深层次政治问题的表现。正如你在介绍中提到的，毛泽东和邓小平之所以如此强大，原因之一是他们可以决定什么是左倾。他们可以决定什么是路线错误。所以我们常常认为存在派系，是因为最高领导人事后决定将一群人标记为一个团体，并说他们代表了某种政治观点。但几乎总是，真正发生的情况是这些人根本不符合主席的意愿，他们没有正确猜测他想要什么，他们因此受到惩罚，然后被贴上这个标签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good question. So when you look at Chinese texts when they talk about leftism and rightism, leftism is always in quotation marks, right? So what is leftism? In theory, leftism basically means that you're too ambitious. You're moving forward too quickly. you don't recognize the objective conditions and therefore you're making a hash of things because you're trying to achieve what is not possible at that particular time. Now, at the same time, leftism is part of the part of what makes the Chinese Communist Party because of this phenomenon known as campaigns, right? So, what's a campaign? A campaign means you get people to go too far deliberately because you need to get them to go too far because the whole point is to jin people up, to get them excited, to inspire zeal. So you expect that things are going to go too far. Now for these people who are the deputies, typically when they go too far and then there's a rectification, they're not punished for it because there was an always expectation that there was going to be some mistakes that you're going to break a few eggs, right? Nevertheless, because this was a system that took ideology so seriously, when there were differences of opinion, often they weren't understood as such. They were seen as manifestations of a deeper political problem. And as you were alluding to in your introduction, one of the reasons Mao and Dung were so powerful is because they got to decide what was leftist. They got to decide what was a line error. And so often the reason we think that there are factions is because the top leader decides after the fact to label a bunch of people as a group and say that they represented some kind of political view. But almost always what really happened is that these people just simply weren't in line with the chairman and they weren't guessing correctly what he wanted and they were punished for it and then they were given this label.</p>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的。好问题。部分原因是为了接班，对吧？所以，中国最高领导人总是考虑他们去世后会发生什么，他们不希望他们的模式随他们一起消失。因此，他们正在考验他们的副手。他们试图弄清楚他们的副手是否能自己做正确的事情。所以，他们不总是想明确，因为他们想看看你会怎么做。但同时，最高领导人也总是改变主意。他们反复无常。他们可以观察一个情况，然后决定事情没有按他们希望的方式发展，然后他们不会立即说出来，看看其他人是否会自己意识到这一点。但同时，我认为通过留下一些模糊性，他们可以看看你是否会利用这个空间尽一切可能忠于最高领导人，或者你是否会表现出一些你自己的倾向，而作为高级领导人，你可能喜欢也可能不喜欢这些倾向。让我们再多谈谈习仲勋的人生轨迹。你的书很大一部分是关于这些历史斗争的，他们痴迷于弄清中国和西北地区的准确历史，谁在何时何地，谁有影响力等等。为什么这如此重要？这些关于历史具体细节的斗争，以及最终这如何导致他被严厉惩罚、流放，基本上被逐出党，遭受羞辱，以及革命期间发生的所有可怕事情，长达16年。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Good question. Part of it was about the succession, right? So, Chinese top leaders always are thinking about what's going to happen after they die and they don't want their model to disappear with them. And so, they're testing their deputies. They're trying to figure out whether their deputies can do the right thing on their own. And so, they don't always want to be clear because they want to see what you do. But also, the top leaders change their mind all the time. They're mercurial. They can watch a situation and decide that things aren't going the well that they wanted and then they don't say that immediately to see whether or not other people are going to realize that on their own. But also, I think that by leaving some ambiguity, they can see whether or not you are going to use that space to do everything you can to remain loyal to the top leader or whether you're going to show some of your own inclinations which you may or may not like as the senior leader. Let's talk about the trajectory of Xi Jang Shun's life a little bit more. A big part of your book is these fights over over history and they're obsessed about like getting the exact history of right of Chinese and the Northwest Territories and who is where when etc and who is influential etc. Why was this so important? These sort of fights over specific details of history and then how did that culminate ultimately in 16 years in which he was sort of extremely punished and banished and basically cast out of the party and humiliated and all the horrible things that happened during the revolution.</p>

### 历史叙事、合法性与政治清洗

**Joseph Torigian:** 主要有两个原因。第一，对于最高领导人来说，你的合法性叙事就是说我总是在辩论的正确一方。所以当你为为什么每个人都应该听你的而辩护时，你的历史版本是否得到肯定，与你是否被视为值得担任主席的人有很大关系。第二个原因是，党是一个全面性的组织。对吧？所以你的整个自我价值感、你的声望、你的地位、你的意义感，都取决于党如何评价你对革命和政权建立后的贡献。所以从这个意义上说，历史对他们来说是绝对的存在性的。而且我认为，当谈到，正如我所说，这种对政权能否生存的执念时，你需要通过讲述党作为一个从一个胜利走向另一个胜利的组织来赢得年轻人的心，因为它是在世界舞台上保证中国重回其应有地位的唯一社会组织方式。对吧？所以出于所有这些原因，历史是如此重要。所以当你被清除出领导层并进行自我批评时，这些自我批评是关于什么的呢？嗯，这是你个人历史的反映。所以当习仲勋被清洗后在政治荒野中度过了16年时，他所写的就是他过去的经历，一遍又一遍，并与最高领导层协商，他以前所做的事情将如何被官方评价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Two reasons primarily. One is for a top leader your legitimation narrative is to say I was always on the right side of the debate. And so when you make the case for why everyone should listen to you, whether or not your version of history is affirmed has a lot to do with whether or not you are seen as someone who deserves to be the chairman. And the second reason is that the party is a totalizing organization. Right? So your entire sense of self-worth, your prestige, your status, your sense of meaning is how the party characterizes your contributions to the revolution and to the regime after it's established. So history in that sense is absolutely existential for them. And I think that also when it comes to, as I said, this preoccupation with whether the regime will survive, you need to win the hearts and minds of young people by talking about the party as an organization that went from one victory to another because it was the only way of organizing society that can guarantee China's return to its rightful place on the world stage. Right? So for all of these reasons, history is so important. And so when you're purged from the leadership and you're doing self-criticisms, what are these self-criticisms about? Well, it's a reflection of your own personal history. So when Xi Jun spent 16 years in the political wilderness after he was purged, what he was writing about was his past over and over and over again and negotiating with the top leadership just exactly how what he had done previously was going to be officially evaluated.</p>

### 中苏关系与“修正主义”的指控

**Tracy Aloway:** 你知道，你之前提到了“亦敌亦友”这个词，作为一名前少女，亦敌亦友对我来说一直很有趣。当我想到过去著名的亦敌亦友时。你喜欢这个过渡吗？是的，我喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you mentioned the word frennemy earlier, and as a former teenage girl, frenemies is something that is of perennial interest to me. And when I think about famous frenemies in the past. Do you like the segue? Yeah, I do.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 好的。当我想到过去著名的亦敌亦友时，我有点想到50年代和60年代的苏联和中国。关于老习仲勋的一个有趣之处在于，他曾一度负责管理中国与当时的苏联专家的关系。那对他来说是怎样的经历？实际操作起来有多棘手？拥有那段经历对他后来的岁月有用吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. When I think about famous frenemies in the past, I kind of think about the Soviet Union and China in the 50s and 60s. And one of the interesting things about the elder shei is that he was for a while in charge of basically managing China's relationship with Soviet experts at the time. What was that experience like for him? How tricky was that to actually do? And was it useful to him in later years having had that experience? So in 1953 the most prominent slogan in the people's republic of China was the Soviet Union of today is China's tomorrow and in fact that also was the year that Xiinping was born and his father Xi Jong was minister of propaganda. In subsequent years when Xi Jong Shun was working for Joan Li at the state council, as you said, one of his tasks was to manage the Soviet expert program. And for a period of time, the number one priority was to learn wholesale from the Soviet Union. And it was rooted in this idea that there was only one way of doing communism.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以在1953年，中华人民共和国最突出的口号是“今天的苏联就是中国的明天”，事实上，那一年也是习近平的出生年份，他的父亲习仲勋当时是宣传部长。在随后的几年里，当习仲勋在周恩来领导下的国务院工作时，正如你所说，他的任务之一就是管理苏联专家项目。在一段时间内，首要任务是全面学习苏联。这根植于一种观念，即共产主义只有一种实现方式。但毛泽东越来越认为，十月革命出了大问题，苏联领导人正在搞**修正主义**（Revisionism: 偏离马克思主义基本原则的理论或实践）。我知道你之前对这个词嗤之以鼻。这些共产主义行话是什么意思？修正主义基本上意味着你不再是一个真正的共产主义者。你没有像你所需要的那样真正左倾，对吧？你没有向前推进。你太害怕尝试为革命议程赢得新的胜利。所以习仲勋会目睹这个故事。他会目睹毛泽东如何逐渐得出结论，认为中国的项目将是不同的。他还会看到另一件事，那就是与中国共产党之外的人，特别是外国人交谈是多么危险。因为1962年对他的一项指控，除了你说的他试图修改历史之外，就是他是一个苏联间谍。所以对习仲勋来说，管理与苏联的关系会非常令人恐惧。对吧？所以中华人民共和国的第一次大清洗是针对一个名叫**高岗**（Gao Gang: 中共早期高级领导人之一，曾任中央人民政府副主席，后因“高岗、饶漱石反党联盟”事件被清除）的人，他也是西北人。他认识习仲勋多年。哦，这让毛泽东相信，高岗在1959年著名的**庐山会议**（Luchan Plenum: 1959年中共中央政治局扩大会议，彭德怀在此次会议上批评“大跃进”运动）上是苏联间谍，当时国防部长**彭德怀**（Peng Dehuai: 中共元帅，曾任国防部长，因在庐山会议上批评“大跃进”而被罢免）对**大跃进**（Great Leap Forward: 1958-1960年中国共产党发动的旨在快速发展经济和工业的运动，造成严重后果）提出了批评意见。在毛泽东看来，彭德怀之所以这样做，也只是因为他与苏联的特殊关系，毛泽东在那里看到了一些阴谋。彭德怀是西北战场的指挥官，习仲勋是他的得力助手。所以，习仲勋基本上是中华人民共和国前两次大清洗的“阿甘正传”式人物，毛泽东都认为他们与苏联有不正当关系，然后他自己也在1962年被清洗。我还要说一件事，这非常引人注目。中国和苏联在管理上遇到麻烦的第一次真正分裂发生在习仲勋访问苏联期间。

<p class="english-text">So in 1953 the most prominent slogan in the people's republic of China was the Soviet Union of today is China's tomorrow and in fact that also was the year that Xiinping was born and his father Xi Jong was minister of propaganda. In subsequent years when Xi Jong Shun was working for Joan Li at the state council, as you said, one of his tasks was to manage the Soviet expert program. And for a period of time, the number one priority was to learn wholesale from the Soviet Union. And it was rooted in this idea that there was only one way of doing communism. But Maadong increasingly came to the view that something had gone deeply wrong with the October revolution that the Soviet leaders were engaging in revisionism. And I know you were chuckling about this word uh earlier. What is this communist jargon? And revisionism basically means you're not really a true communist anymore. That you are not as actually leftist as you need to be, right? You're not pushing forward. you're too scared to to try to win new victories for the revolutionary agenda. And so Xi Junction would have witnessed this story. He would have witnessed how Maudong gradually came to the conclusion that the Chinese project was going to be different. And he also would have seen something else, which was how dangerous it was to talk to people outside the Chinese Communist Party, especially foreigners. because one of the accusations against him in 1962 other than as you said that he was trying to revise history was that he was a spy for the Soviet Union. So it would have been very frightening for Xi Jong Shin to manage relations with the Soviets. Right? So the first great purge of the people's republic of China was a man named Gao Gang and he was another northwesterner. He had known Xiang for years. Oh, this is come to believe that exactly Mao came to believe that Ga was a spy for the Soviet Union in 1959 at the famous for Chinese historians Luchan Penum when the defense minister Pong Deai made critical remarks of the great leap forward. He also in Mao's mind only did that because of his special relationship with the Soviet Union and he saw some some machinations there and Pong Dehai was the commander on the northwest battlefield and Xi Jong was his right-hand man. So uh Si Jun was basically a forest gump for the two first great purges of the people's republic of China and they both were seen by Mao as having had illicit relations with the Soviet Union and then he is purged in 1962 as well. I'll say one other thing about this which is quite remarkable. So the first split that was really something that the Chinese and Soviets had trouble managing happened while Xi Junction was visiting the Soviet Union.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 发生的事情是，中印边境发生了第一次冲突。几名印度士兵被杀。当习仲勋出访时，苏联发表了一份声明，基本上采取了中立立场，尽管苏联和中国当时处于正式联盟关系。中国人对此非常愤怒。习仲勋提前离开了莫斯科。几周后，苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫访问中国时，毛泽东对他说：“你们的声明让帝国主义者很高兴。”毛泽东的结论是，为什么苏联人不支持我们？为什么他们不更支持我们？他的答案是，这不是因为苏联人追求自己的利益。我们有我们的利益。而是因为他们不再是真正的共产主义者了。他们已经修正主义了。实际上，再次将其与习仲勋联系起来，这促使毛泽东对阶级斗争的观念产生了执念。他想找到一种方法来确保阶级斗争永远不会消失。而他1962年对习仲勋的镇压，就与他对阶级斗争重要性的这种沉思和执念有关，这部分是受到他所认为的苏联革命事业堕落的启发。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">And what had happened was there was an altercation on the border between China and India, the first one. And several Indian soldiers were killed. And while Xi Jongun was traveling, the Soviets put out a statement that essentially took a neutral position even though the Soviet Union and China were in a formal alliance. And the Chinese were absolutely furious. And Xi Jongun left Moscow early. And when Nikita Kruef, the Soviet leader, visited China just a few weeks later, Mao said to him, "Your statement made the imperialists happy." And Ma's conclusion was why aren't the Soviets, why don't they have our back? Why aren't they more supportive? And his answer was that it wasn't that the Soviets were pursuing their interests. We have our interests. It was that they're not really communists anymore. They've gone revisionist. And actually, to tie it again back to Shiong Shun, it contributed to Ma's preoccupation with this idea of class struggle. And he wanted to figure out a way to make sure class struggle never went away. and his crackdown on Xi Jongun in 1962 was related to his marinating and this obsession with the importance of class struggle that was partly inspired by what he saw as the degradation of the revolutionary project in the Soviet Thank you.</p>

### 文化大革命的阴影与习近平的应对

**Joe Wisenthal:** 所以习仲勋被清洗，遭受了16年的绝对折磨。你把他描述为20世纪中国的“阿甘正传”式人物，这很有趣，因为当然，在他职业生涯的后期，他积极参与了广东和**深圳**（Shenzhen: 中国广东省的一个主要城市，也是中国第一个经济特区）的开放，以及人们熟知的**经济特区**（Special Economic Zones: 旨在通过特殊政策吸引外资和技术，促进经济发展的特定区域）。但他生命的其余大部分时间，似乎一直担心着滑回**文化大革命**（Cultural Revolution: 1966-1976年在中国发生的一场政治运动，对社会造成巨大冲击）时期。根据你的书，文化大革命之前有很多类似的模式，这些清洗和运动之后也存在。我只是好奇，在你看来，即使是今天，党能否完全避免再次陷入这种自我毁灭的环境，或者说，这种陷入如此激烈、具有破坏性的内部斗争的倾向是否永远是党结构固有的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Xi Jang Shan was purged and subject to 16 years of absolute torment. It's funny you characterize him as sort of like the Forest Gump of 20th century China because of course later on in his career he was heavily involved in Guandong and the opening of Shenzen and these special opportunity zones or special economic zones which people know a lot about there. But he spent like much of the rest of his life essentially fearing the possibility it seems there's my reading of your book that the everpresent risk of sliding back into cultural revolution type periods and the cultural revolution per your book it there were many patterns of it prior to it it's sort of these purges and campaigns they existed afterward in I'm just curious in your view can the party even today ever be inured against the potential of reverting ing back into such a self-destructive environment such as that or is that always going to be endemic to the structure of the party that it could trip into these sort of intense inward battles that are so damaging?</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的，这是一个非常有见地的问题。要回答你提出的问题，一个证据就是看看习近平本人在文化大革命期间的经历，以及他是如何谈论它的。习近平说，文化大革命开始时，所有人都相信它，这是事实。所以当它被证明是一场灾难时，这让人深感幻灭。习近平承认，他也经历了一段怀疑时期，但正是因为他经历了这段思考为什么会发生如此可怕的事情的时期，但他仍然回到了党的道路，这意味着他的奉献比任何人都更坚定不移。在1980年代，在我发现的那些采访中，他谈到他如何看待1980年代是一个人们应该更加忠于党的时期，因为现在他们可以做一些事情了。现在左倾和激进主义已经消失了。所以你终于可以努力让中国走向正确的方向。事实上，他说他不想弥补失去的时间去玩乐和赚钱的原因，是因为他想确保另一次文化大革命永远不会发生。但这提出了一个问题，对吧，那就是你如何阻止这种情况发生？所以一些和习近平经历相同的人，他们认为中国需要**法治**（Rule of Law: 法律至上，所有人都必须遵守法律，政府权力受到法律约束）。它需要阻止另一个强人领导人的出现。而习近平的答案是，你需要一个不受约束的党。你需要一个如此强大的党，以至于它能够阻止那些在获得自由时利用自由伤害他人的人。所以对于习近平来说，很多人认为他是一个毛主义者，他所做的事情有很多与文化大革命相似的元素。这当然是真的。但正如你所说，我们与文化大革命联系在一起的很多东西，从一开始就是党的一部分。那么问题是，习近平他想利用斗争。他想利用运动，但他也不想再来一次文化大革命。那是什么意思呢？嗯，他和周围的人都说，我们不会重演文化大革命的悲剧。我们将避免那种激进主义。我们也将认识到，毛泽东去世后我们失去了一种警惕感，我们将找到这种“幸福的中间地带”。但这种意义上的“幸福的中间地带”是什么呢？对吧？就像斗争不是一个法律概念。它也不是一个清晰的概念。所以你可以看到理论上你会恰到好处地掌握它，但实际上却非常困难。我认为这就是我们看到中国在平衡经济和安全方面挣扎的原因之一，因为同时做两件事很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's a very insightful question. One piece of evidence to get at what you're driving at is to look what Xiinping himself experienced during the cultural revolution and how he's talked about it. Xiinping said that when the cultural revolution began, everyone believed in it, which was true. So when it became clear that it was a disaster, it was profoundly disillusioning. And Xiinping admitted that he too went through a period of doubt, but that precisely because he went through this time of thinking about why such a terrible thing could happen. but nevertheless return to the party's cause meant that his dedication is more unshakable than anyone's anyone else's. And the 1980s in these interviews that I found that he gave, he talks about how he saw the 1980s as a time when people should be even more loyal to the party because now they could do something. Now the leftism and the radicalism had gone away. so you could finally work to bring China in the right direction. And in fact, he said that the reason that he didn't want to make up for lost time and have fun and make money was because he wanted to make sure that another cultural revolution never happened. But it raises a question, right, which is how do you stop that from happening? And so some people who went through the same thing that Xiinping did, they believe that China needed the rule of law. It needed to prevent another strong man leader from appearing. And Xiinping's answer was you need to have a party that's unconstrained. You need to have a party that's so powerful that it can stop people who when are given the freedom to do so take advantage of it and use it to hurt people. And so for Xiinping, a lot of people think that he's a Mauist figure that a lot of what he's doing has elements that are reminiscent of the cultural revolution. And that's certainly true. But as you said, a lot of what we associate with the cultural revolution has been part of the party since the very beginning. And the question then is so Xiinping, he wants to use struggle. He wants to use campaigns, but he also doesn't want another cultural revolution. Well, what does that mean? Well, he and people around him have said that, well, we're not going to do the tragedy of the cultural revolution. We're going to avoid that kind of radicalism. We're also going to recognize that we lost a sense of vigilance after Ma's death and we're going to h find this happy medium. But what is a happy medium in this sense, right? Like struggle is not a legal concept. It's not a clear idea really. So you can see how in theory that you would get it just the right amount, but that in practice it's very hard. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing China struggle to balance the economy and security is because it's hard to do two things at once.</p>

### 习近平与父亲习仲勋的传承与创新

**Tracy Aloway:** 是的。我一直觉得有趣的是，在现代中国，国内有很多对文化大革命的描绘。比如历史剧，或者在《三体》中有一段非常非常长的章节描写了那段历史，这在某种程度上正好说明了你所描述的，即习近平希望人们了解发生了什么，并理解滑向类似文化大革命的危险。就此而言，你认为习近平在多大程度上真正借鉴了他父亲的经验来制定自己的政策？或者我们是否陷入了这样的陷阱，认为所有中国政治都必须是王朝式的，都与家族成员的继承有关？这在多大程度上是真的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I always thought it was interesting that in modern China there there are a lot of portrayals domestically of the cultural revolution. So things like historical dramas or in the threebody problem there's a very very long section on that and it kind of indicates exactly what you're describing which is to some extent Xiinping wants people to know what happened and to understand the danger of sliding back into something like the cultural revolution. Just on that note, to what extent do you think Xiinping actually draws from his father's experience in terms of his own policy? Or are we sort of falling into the trap where we think that all of Chinese politics has to be dynastic and it's all about family members succeeding family members? To what extent is that true?</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以习仲勋以党所能产生的最好的人的形象而闻名，几乎是独一无二的人道、自由、支持改革。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, Shiong has a reputation as the best kind of person that the party could produce, almost uniquely humane, liberal, pro-reform.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 所以当习近平上台时，许多了解这个家庭或了解一些党史的人认为他会像他们所理解的他的父亲那样。而当他朝着让他们失望的方向发展，事实上让他们大吃一惊时，他们非常非常失望。他们所做的一件事就是将他与他的父亲进行负面对比。一位流亡美国的异议知识分子说，习近平不是习仲勋的儿子，他是毛泽东的孙子。所以这种将习仲勋政治化地用来反对习近平的做法。我相信习近平对此深恶痛绝。但问题就变成了，习近平是否受到他父亲的积极榜样或消极榜样的启发。有些人说，习近平看到他父亲的自由政策失败了，这就是他做完全不同的事情的原因。你知道我们不能确定，但我可以说几件事。第一件有趣的是，习近平在《**人民日报**》（People's Daily: 中国共产党中央委员会机关报）上发表的第一篇文章是关于党内老一代和年轻一代之间关系的。他基本上说，我们需要尊重他们。我们可以从他们身上学到很多东西，但如果我们完全照搬他们所做的，从不创新，那我们就不尊重他们了。对吧？我们需要与时俱进。而且我认为，他内心深处想做的就是确保政权能够生存，他所做的一切都是为了这个目的，这意味着他基本上继承了他父亲想要的大局，那就是确保党和党的利益能够代代相传。那么他是否做了与他父亲不同的事情呢？是的。这是对他父亲的刻意拒绝吗？我不太确定。我想他可能会说，我所做的核心与我父亲所做的相同，但我们也需要与时俱进，这是一个党不断学习新事物并需要应对新客观条件的故事。最后一点，习近平说中国共产党之所以能够生存下来，而其他共产党未能生存，是因为它具有这种变革能力。正是因为党能够将马克思主义**中国化**（Sinicize Marxism: 将马克思主义基本原理与中国具体实际和中华优秀传统文化相结合，形成具有中国特色的马克思主义理论），并使其适应国家条件，从而找到一种中国式的现代化，他们才能找到这种非西方的发展方式。所以，他如何玩转传统与创新之间的辩证法，这很有趣，但从这个意义上说，我认为他的思想在这里有点微妙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when Xiinping came to power, a lot of individuals who knew the family or knew something about party history believed that he was going to be like what their understanding of his father was. And when he moved in a direction that disappointed them and in fact was quite a surprise for them, they were so so disappointed. And one of the things that they did was they negatively contrasted him with his father. One dissident exiled intellectual in the United States said that Xiinping is not the son of Xi Jong, he's the grandson of Mahatong. So this politicized use of Xi Jong against Xiinping. And I'm sure that Xiinping hates it. But then the question becomes well is Xiinping inspired by his father as a positive example or as a negative example. Some people have said that well Xiinping saw that his father's liberal policies failed and that's why he's doing some something completely different. You know we can't say for sure but I can say a couple things. One is that it's interesting it's interesting that Xiinping's very first article published in People's Daily was about the relationship between older generations in the party and younger generations. And he said essentially that we need to respect them. We can learn so much from them but we would not respect them if we did exactly what they did and we never innovate. Right? We need to move along with the times. And also I think that at heart what he wants to do is make sure that the regime survives and everything he's doing is for that purpose which means that he is essentially inheriting the big picture of what his father wanted which was to ensure that the party and the party's interests could persist from one generation to another. So is he doing certain things different from what his father did? Yes. Is it a conscious rejection of his father? I'm not so sure. I think maybe he would say that the heart of what I'm doing is the same as what my father did, but also we need to change with the times and it's a story of the party constantly learning new things and needing to address new objective conditions as they appear. And one last point on this, Xiinping says that the reason the Chinese Communist Party survived when other communist parties did not is because it had this capacity for change. That it was because the party could cynicize Marxism and adapt it to national conditions, therefore find a Chinese style of modernization that they could find this way of a non-western style of development. So, it's interesting how he plays with this dialectic between tradition and innovation, but in that sense, I think his thinking here is is a little subtle.</p>

**Joseph Torigian:** 他知道得更清楚，但他仍然让自己成为受害者，通过这样做，他毁灭了自己。他毁灭了船员。尽管他是一个认识到亚哈船长是那种如果儿子侮辱他就会打击儿子的人，这确实是非常毛主义的说法，对吧？就像毛泽东真的有点崇拜这种斗争、反击和拥有强大个性的想法，但他仍然没有真正做任何事情。而且，就像习仲勋一样，斯塔布克也不是一个明确的英雄或反派，对吧？他提出了关于他作为这个特定系统一部分所做事情的道德问题。斯塔布克也没有合法的途径来罢免亚哈船长，对吧？所以，有那么一刻他想过杀死他，但他认识到那违反了船上的法律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">he knew better but he still allowed himself to be a victim and by doing that he doomed himself. he doomed the crew. And even though he was someone who recognized that Ahab was the kind of person who would strike the sun if if the son insulted him, which really is a very mauist thing to say, right? Like Mao really kind of fetishized this idea of struggle and fighting back and having a strong personality, he still didn't really do anything about it. And also like Xi Jun, Starbucks isn't clearly a hero or a villain, right? He raises questions about the morality of what he was doing as part of this particular system. Starbucks also didn't really have legal recourse to removing Ahab, right? So, there's this one moment where he thinks about killing him, but he recognizes that that's a violation of the law of the ship.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 此外，斯塔布克与习仲勋相似之处在于，当他认为事情没有按照他认为正确的方式发展时，他会提出异议，但非常谨慎，以至于他几乎没有真正提出异议，因为他太谨慎了。所以，我最后再说一件事，对吧？所以，《白鲸记》有趣的地方在于，全体船员都认同了追捕这头鲸鱼的疯狂想法，对吧？这让我想起了**邓小平**（Deng Xiaoping: 中共第二代领导核心，中国改革开放的总设计师）关于大跃进的一句话，那就是“我们都发烧了”，对吧？这提出了一个问题：为什么人们会对这样一个奇怪而古怪的人如此忠诚？我认为这是因为这种冒险、刺激和使命感，触及了他们内心深处的一些东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Also, Starbucks is is similar to Xi Jun in the sense that when he thinks that something is not going the way he thinks is right, he remmonstrates but very carefully in a way that he's almost not even really remmonstrating because of just how cautious he is. So, and I'll say one final thing about this, right? So, what's interesting about Moby Dick is the whole crew kind of gets on board with this crazy idea of hunting this whale, right? And it kind of reminds me of this quote by Deng Xiaoping about the great leap forward, which is that we all had the fever, right? And it raises this question like why would people be so loyal to this person who's so strange and so eccentric? And I think it's because this idea of of the adventure and the thrill and and mission was was something that spoke to something at at the heart of their lives. So</p>

**Tracy Aloway:** 也许他们都只是创伤性地结合在一起了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">maybe they're all just trauma bonded.</p>

**Joseph Torigian:** 几点想法。我忘了创伤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A few thoughts. I forgot about trauma.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 嗯，你知道，当你写传记时，你需要谈论心理学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, it's when you write a biography, you need to talk about psychology</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 习仲勋和习近平经历了这些创伤的事实不容忽视，你需要谈论它，需要解决它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the fact that Xi Jun and Xiinping went through these traumas can't be ignored and you need to talk about it and it needs to be addressed.</p>

### 历史研究方法与中共理解的误区

**Joseph Torigian:** 但心理学和历史，心理学和政治是不同的学科，这是有原因的，那就是你不能将他们的行为本质化为他们童年时期的经历。对吧？所以很多人认为斯大林所做的一切都可以用他小时候被父亲殴打的事实来解释，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But psychology and history, psychology and politics are different disciplines for a reason, which is that you can't essentialize their behavior down to what they experienced as children. Right? So a lot of people thought that everything Stalin did could be explained by the fact that he was beaten up when he was a young person, right? By his father.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 哦，是的。斯大林的传记作家**斯坦福·科特金**（Stanford Cotkin: 知名历史学家，专注于苏联历史，著有斯大林传记）有句名言。他说：“哦，人们说他父亲虐待他，酗酒。”他说：“在19世纪末20世纪初的那个地区，谁的父亲不虐待人，不酗酒呢？”所以，无论如何，抱歉，你继续说。但是的，这是一个好观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. The Stalin biographer Stanford Cotkin. He has this great line. He's like, "Oh, people say that his father was abusive and drunk." And he's like, "Who wasn't abusive and drunk in the early late 1800s in that area?" So can't anyway, sorry, keep going. But yes, that's a good point.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的，我还要说一件事。D.H.劳伦斯在一本书中写了一章关于《白鲸记》的内容，他谈到了所有这些为了疯狂追逐而进行的实用主义，这也确实触及了我们所谈论的党的核心，那就是在革命期间，在大跃进期间，在文化大革命期间，你看到了这些乌托邦式的目标，但同时这并不意味着党在某些时候，甚至在同一时刻，有时比其他时候更甚，没有这种非常务实的一面，非常灵活的一面，而这两个元素从一开始就以我认为有意义的方式共存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'll say one other thing about this. It's a DH Lawrence wrote chapter in a book about Moby Dick and he talked about all this practicality in search of a mad mad chase and that also really gets to something at the heart of the party that we've talked about which is during the revolution during the great leap forward during the cultural revolution you see these goals that are just utopian and at the same time that doesn't mean that the party at sometimes even the same moment sometimes more than others doesn't also have this very practical side very flexible side and these two elements have coexisted from the very beginning in ways that I think are meaningful to dwell on too.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 所以，当涉及到像这些非常宏大的历史项目时，我总是好奇你是如何收集研究资料的，你查阅了哪些资料，以及你是否发现了以前可能不为人知的新事物。然后就此而言，你认为学者或者说西方人普遍在理解中共实际运作方式时最大的误解是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one thing I'm always curious when it comes to books like these very large historic projects is how you actually go about gathering your research and what sources you're looking at and whether you're finding new things that potentially people were unaware of before. And then just on that note, what would you say is the biggest misconception that academics or maybe people in the West in general tend to have when it comes to understanding how the CCP actually works.</p>
</details>

**Joseph Torigian:** 是的。所以当你研究中国共产党时，你不能只去几个档案馆，收集材料，然后写出来。你需要有不同的敏感性。你必须对可能性敏感，而不是局限性，并认识到你将不得不收集许多不同类型的证据，并制作一个马赛克，你将能够比其他人更好地理解某些事情，但未来人们会发现新的东西，这是一个持续的项目。永远不会有一个明确的版本，但尽管如此，你仍然可以做足够多的事情，至少在过渡时期说一些有意义的事情，一些可以开启对话的事情。所以，例如，许多内部文件，许多档案已经进入了美国的图书馆以及香港和台湾的机构。大陆的人们能够在审查之外出版历史，还有文献集和回忆录，但你也需要使用来自中国大陆的资料。所以有一段时间，党史期刊确实在突破界限。但即使是官方资料，比如编年史和官方传记，你也可以从中挖掘传记细节，但你也可以将其置于你收集的其他材料的背景下，然后突然之间，这些证据对你来说就变得有意义了，甚至可能连其编纂者都没有想到。而且我还列出了习仲勋每次会见外国人的清单，然后试图与那个人交谈或去他们的档案。我与**达赖喇嘛**（Dalai Lama: 藏传佛教格鲁派的领袖）交谈过。我去了法国共产党档案，因为习仲勋去过法国。我去了塞尔维亚的档案，因为他去了南斯拉夫（当时还存在）的一个重要的代表大会。诸如此类。所以你知道主要的误解是什么？嗯，要说的一点是，这并不总是西方人不理解中国，因为文化原因或其他什么而犯错的情况。但即使是这个体系的核心人物也常常犯错。对吧？所以，正如我之前提到的，那些认识习仲勋的人，当习近平成为什么样的领导人变得清晰时，他们完全惊呆了，对吧？而这些人并不是愚蠢的人。这些人都是久经沙场的人。而这些清洗之所以发生，像习仲勋这样实际上非常谨慎和聪明的人，为什么会在权力斗争的暗礁上触礁，是因为他也没有完全理解他所做事情的后果。所以从这个意义上说，我们应该记住，要正确理解这个系统是多么困难。不仅对外部的人来说，对内部的人来说也是如此。这是一个很棒的结局。Joseph Torigian，非常棒的书。非常感谢你来到OddLots和我们聊天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So when you do research on the Chinese Communist Party, you can't just go to a couple archives, collect the material, and write it up. You need to have a different sense of sensibilities. You have to be sensitive to the possibilities, not the limitations, and recognize that you're going to have to collect a lot of different types of evidence and make a mosaic, and you'll be able to understand certain things better than others, but that in the future, people will find new things and that it's it's an ongoing project. There's never going to be a definitive version, but nevertheless, there's enough that you can do to say in the interim at least, something meaningful, something to start a conversation. And so, for example, a lot of internal documents, a lot of archives have made their way to American libraries and institutions in Hong Kong and Taiwan. People from the mainland were able to publish histories outside of censorship, but also document collections and memoirs, but you also need to use the stuff that comes out of mainland China. So there was a period where party history journals were really pushing the envelope. But even the official stuff like the chronologies and the official biographies, you can mine those things for biographical details, but also you can put it in the context of other material you've collected and then suddenly that evidence is meaningful to you in a way that maybe even the compilers of it did not expect. And also I just made a list of every time that Xi Jun met with a foreigner and then tried to either speak to that person or go to their archives. I spoke to the Daly Lama. I went to the French Communist Party archives because Xiin went to France. I went to the archives in uh Serbia because he went to a big important Congress in Yugoslavia when it still existed. That kind of thing. And so you know what are the what are the main misunderstandings? Well, one thing to say is that this isn't always just a case of Westerners who don't understand China getting it wrong for cultural reasons or whatever. But people at the very heart of this system also constantly got it wrong. Right? And so, as I mentioned earlier, these people who knew the she were totally dumbfounded by Xiinping when it became clear what kind of a leader he was going to be, right? And these were not stupid people. These were people who had been around the block over and over and over again. And the reason these purges happened, the reason why someone like Shijin, who was actually quite cautious and quite clever, why he crashed on the shoulds of power struggles is because he also didn't fully understand the repercussions of what he was doing. So in that sense, we should keep in mind just how hard it is to get this system right. Not just for people on the outside, but even for people on the inside, too. That's a great ending. Joseph Turigan, fantastic book. Really appreciate you uh coming on OddLotss and chatting with us.</p>

### 结语：模糊的政治概念与历史的循环

**Joe Wisenthal:** Tracy，在我们录制那集节目的时候，Joseph提到了中共的各种运动。所以，我去了维基百科页面，我喜欢他们一些运动的名字，因为有些很直接，比如“清理阶级队伍运动”，这很明显，但有些则像“反击右倾翻案风运动”、“批林批孔运动”，这些总是很有诗意。“除四害运动”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, while we were uh recording that episode, Joseph mentioned the various campaigns that they had, the CCP. So, I went to the Wikipedia page and like I love some of the names of their campaigns cuz like some of them are like sort of straightforward like cleansing the class ranks campaign kind of obvious but then like counterattack the right devi counterattack the right deviationist reversal of verdicts trend campaign the criticize Lynn criticize confucious classic obviously campaign there's something always very poetic about these the four pests campaign</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 哦，是的，那个非常悲伤，而且适得其反。但我认为你提到了一个重要的点，那就是一场运动。你提到的第二个是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh yeah where that one was very sad and kind of blew up in their face. But I think you're getting to an important point, which is a campaign. What was the second one you mentioned?</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 等等，抱歉。“反击右倾翻案风运动”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Wait, sorry. The counterattack the right deviationist reversal of verdicts trend campaign.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 抱歉。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry. Um</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 那是“四人帮”攻击邓小平，邓小平参与了为在文化大革命中受到不当惩罚的人平反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was the gang of four attacking Diaang who was involved in reversing verdicts of people who had been improperly punished during the cultural revolution.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Aloway:** 对。但这实际上很重要，因为它就像那到底是什么意思？我认为这在某种程度上既是中国共产党的力量，也是它的弱点，那就是这些概念很多都是模糊不清、不断变化的，而且它们常常是故意模糊的，这样领导人就可以施加控制，并宣布什么才是真正的反右或反修正主义等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. But this is actually important because it's like what does that mean exactly? And I think this is kind of been both a strength and a weakness of the CCP over time which is that a lot of these concepts are fuzzy and everchanging and often they are fuzzy on purpose so that the leader can exert control and declare what actually is anti-right or anti- revisionism or whatever.</p>
</details>

**Joe Wisenthal:** 不，完全是。很清楚。我的意思是，显然有那个长达多少年的时期，正式的1966-1976年文化大革命，习老和习少都经历了真正令人难以置信的个人羞辱和痛苦，但它确实延伸到之前和之后。我真的，你知道，很清楚，在这样的政治体系中，要完全防范那种全面政治的回归，绝非易事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, totally. It is clear. I mean obviously there's like the however many year period the formal the 1966 1976 cultural revolution which she the elder she and the younger she well like truly like unbelievable levers levels of personal humiliation and suffering but it really extended both before that and afterwards and I really you know it's clear like it is not easy in a political system such as that to ever fully guard against the return of that style of full-blown politics.</p>

**Tracy Aloway:** 不，我绝对不会。我只是觉得在这种情况下非常有趣，作者碰巧对《白鲸记》中的一个角色和他的书的作者之间有异常深入的思考。所以，我不得不提出来。我觉得那非常出乎意料和奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I definitely won't. I just thought it was very funny in this case that the author happened to have a lot of an unusually high level of drawn out thoughts between one character and Moby Dick and the author of his book.
