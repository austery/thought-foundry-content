summary: 安大略省政府提议通过《支持儿童和学生法案》（Bill 33）重新引入学校资源官（SRO）项目，旨在保护学生并建立信任。然而，批评者认为该项目未能解决校园暴力的根本原因，反而可能让边缘化学生感到不安全。本文深入探讨了SRO项目的利弊，回顾了其在2020年因系统性危害（尤其对黑人和原住民学生）而终止的历史，并讨论了当前关于校园安全、资源配置以及对不同社区影响的激烈辩论。

### 引言与SRO项目背景

政府表示，在学校中配备警官将保护学生并建立信任。但另一些人则认为，**SRO**（School Resource Officer: 学校资源官，指派到学校的警官）项目无法解决暴力的根本原因，反而会让一些学生感到不安全。那么，数据告诉我们什么？

<p class="english-text">The government says having police officers in schools would protect students and build trust. But others say the school resource officer program wouldn't address the root cause of violence and would make some students feel unsafe. So what does the data tell us?</p>

我从密西沙加第一区和第七区的学校理事李安·科尔（Leeann Cole），以及皮尔黑人集体（Peel Black Collective）和黑人教育基金（Black Education Fund）的联合创始人、人权教育家大卫·博斯维尔德（David Bosveld）那里获得了关于该项目利弊的见解。大卫、李安，欢迎来到节目。你们好吗？

<p class="english-text">I got insight into the program's pros and cons from Leeann Cole school trustee for Mississauga Wards one and seven, and David Bosveld, co-founder of Peel Black Collective and Black Education Fund and powers in a Human Rights Educator. David, Leanne, welcome to the program. How are you guys doing?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 很好，谢谢。

</details>

主持人: 好的。我们直接从**Bill 33**（Supporting Children and Students Act: 《支持儿童和学生法案》，安大略省政府提出的一项法案）开始。安大略省政府的Bill 33，即《支持儿童和学生法案》，要求各教育局在有条件的情况下实施SRO项目。李安，你最近在**皮尔区教育局**（Peel District School Board: 安大略省的一个地方教育管理机构）会议上提出了一项关于该项目的动议。你的动议旨在做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. We're going to start off with Bill 33 right into it, the Ontario government's Bill 33, the Supporting Children and Students Act, calls on school boards to implement School Resource Officer SRO programs, where such programs are available. Now, Leanne, you introduced a motion at a recent Peel District School Board meeting regarding the program. What did your motion set out to do?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 这项动议是邀请警方，即皮尔区警局（Peel Regional Police）和**OPP**（Ontario Provincial Police: 安大略省省警），来到教育局与工作人员讨论，如果重新引入这个项目，它可能会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the motion is to invite the police, meaning Peel Regional Police and the OPP, to come to the school board and have a discussion with staff as to how it might look like if this program is reintroduced.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。我应该提一下，你今天是在发言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. I should mention you were speaking today.</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我今天不是代表教育局发言。我是在表达我个人的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I am not speaking on behalf of the board today. I'm speaking from what I feel personally.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的，大卫，让我们回顾一下。2017年。那是SRO项目结束的时候。2020年，2020年。抱歉，SRO项目是什么，为什么它在2020年结束了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right, David, take us back a little bit. 2017. That is when the SRO program ended. 2020, 2020. Sorry, what was the SRO program and why did it end in 2020?</p>
</details>

David: 嗯，那是在乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）被谋杀之后，我认为当时有一种真正的动力去审视各种结构和系统，特别是它们如何影响边缘化群体，比如黑人、原住民。皮尔区警方与社区进行了对话，听取了反馈。我们了解到，皮尔区警局的一些警官利用这个项目来磨练他们的调查技能，并为他们的晋升服务。我们还听说了那个6岁女孩被戴上手铐和脚镣的故事。最终，我们进行了一系列非常艰难的讨论。皮尔区警方自行决定终止该项目。随后的政治环境发生了一些变化。五年过去了。人们不再过多地考虑所谓的“觉醒主义”（Wokeism）。现在我们处于一个人们积极希望警官重返学校的环境中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it was in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, and I think there was a real impetus to look at structures and systems, and particularly how they affect marginalised groups, black people, Indigenous folks. And the Peel police entered a conversation with the community where feedback was given and taken. And, you know, we learned that the Peel Regional Police, some of their officers were using the program to hone their investigative skills and for advancement in their jobs. And we heard the story of the 6-year-old girl who was handcuffed and shackled. And ultimately, you know, we had this series of very difficult discussions. And the Peel police determined on their own to end the program. And the political environment has subsequently changed a little bit. It's five years later. People aren't thinking so much about, you know, the so-called Wokeism. And here we are in an environment where people are, you know, actively wishing to have police officers back in schools.</p>
</details>

主持人: 就该项目的持续时间而言，在所有这些反馈出现之前，它实际持续了多久？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In terms of the programs length, how long did it actually last for before all of that feedback?</p>
</details>

David: 我不清楚它具体存在了多久，但它存在的时间足够长，造成了严重的伤害。

### SRO项目运作与暴力事件数据

主持人: 好的。我应该提一下，我们确实向教育部（Ministry of Education）寻求了一份声明。但在录制前我们没有收到回复。李安，请帮助我们理解SRO项目应该如何运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. I should mention that we did reach out for a statement from the Ministry of Education. We did not hear back in time for the taping. Leanne help us understand, how the SRO program is supposed to work.</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我真的无法谈论在我担任理事之前它应该如何运作，但据我所知，他们应该作为学生的支持者，与学生建立关系。他们并非专门为了让学生惹麻烦或逮捕他们之类的。主要只是以支持的方式与学生建立关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I really can't speak to how it was supposed to work before I was a trustee, but from what I know, they were supposed to be there as a support for students, to build relationships with students. They weren't there specifically to get students in trouble or to arrest them or or anything like that. It was mainly just to create a relationship with students and in a supportive way.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么请帮助我们理解。从日常来看，学校里有警官会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So help us understand. So from a day to day, what would that look like? with a police officer in the classroom,</p>
</details>

Leeann: 没有他们会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What would it look like without them?</p>
</details>

主持人: 有他们呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> With them?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我不确定他们是否会一直在教室里。我想他们可能在学校的任何地方。但是，你知道，这就是我现在提出这项动议的原因，是为了看看未来会是什么样子，因为我们确实认识到它并不完美，但通过错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't necessarily know if they were in the classrooms. I think they could have been anywhere on on school property. but, you know, this is why I'm bringing this motion forward now, is to see what that might look like going forward, because we do recognize that it wasn't wasn't perfect, but thorough mistakes.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。我想展示一张图表。这是《环球新闻》（Global News）在八月下旬整理的数据，显示了安大略省学校的暴力事件数量。正如你所看到的，在疫情前数字有所上升，在疫情中期学校关闭时下降到约1000起，然后在学校重新开放后上升到4000多起。大卫，SRO项目的结束与学校暴力事件的增加之间有联系吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. I want to show a graphic. This is data compiled by Global News in late August showing the number of violent incidences in Ontario schools. As you can see, the numbers creep up just before the pandemic, a drop to around 1000 in the middle of the pandemic when schools were closed and then rise to over 4000 after the school closures ended. David, is there a connection between the end of the SRO program and the rise of violence in schools?</p>
</details>

David: 嗯，我不这么认为。正如理事科尔所说，SRO项目并非旨在成为一个执法项目，而是一个建立关系的项目。所以那些说“嘿，我们的学校不安全，把警察请回来，然后就会安全”的人，我认为他们扭曲了这些项目的目的。建立关系并不是逮捕、戴手铐和处理那些可以由学校工作人员和校长处理的纪律问题。所以我认为，你知道，该项目以前的设计，尽管旨在建立关系，但却演变成了校长可以召集警官来处理某些问题。警官们也乐意这样做。结果就是导致了孩子们的犯罪化。当我们具体看皮尔区警局，我来自布兰普顿（Brampton），我们发现，在社区中，根据他们每年公布的武力使用数据，黑人占社区人口的10%，但却占武力使用事件的30%。所以，如果你要在学校引入警官，我认为不难假设，如果学校有10%的黑人学生人口，他们可能会在任何形式的警察互动中遭受30%的负面影响。因此，我认为，科尔理事也提出了一个很好的观点，即学校需要支持。问题是这些支持是什么？更多的辅导员？也许更小的班级规模？儿童和青少年工作者？社会工作者？心理健康专业人员？这些都是经过培训的专业人员来处理儿童问题。而警察是经过培训的专业人员来处理犯罪问题。所以我们正在将一种潜在的支持引入学校，而这种支持可能有点过头了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I don't think so. And like Trustee Cole said, right, the SRO program is not designed to be an enforcement program, but a relationship-building program. So the folks that are, you know, saying, hey, our schools are unsafe, bring back police officers, and then they'll be safe. I think our contorting right what the purpose of those programs was building relationships is not arresting and handcuffing and dealing with discipline that could be handled by school staff and principals. So I think, you know, the previous design of the program, although it was intended to be, you know, relationship building morphed into, you know, the principal could call on the police officer to address certain issues. And the police officers were, you know, willingly doing that. And so it ended up with the criminalisation of kids. And when we look at Peel Regional Police, specifically where I'm from in Brampton, what we find is in the community and based on the data that they present annually around use of force, black people represent 10% of the community, but 30% of the use-of-force incidents. So if you were to introduce police officers in schools, I don't think it's a difficult assumption to assume that if the schools had 10% black student population, that they could be receiving 30% of negative police interactions in whatever form those existed. And so I think, you know, also, Trustee Cole makes a good point that there needs to be supports in schools. And the question is what are those supports more guidance counsellors, perhaps smaller class sizes, child and youth workers, social workers, mental health professionals which are trained professionals to deal with children. Right. And police are trained professionals to deal with crime. And so we're introducing, you know, potentially a support into schools that, you know, perhaps goes a bit too far.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我想听听你的看法。大卫提出了——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to get your take on that. You know, David makes a--</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我完全同意。而且我认为，我希望如果我的动议能被其他理事通过，当我们与警方和教育局进行讨论时，我希望他们的报告能带回：我们下次将如何做得不同？我们将如何确保我们能为孩子们提供帮助，不仅是孩子们，还有教职员工，让他们也感到安全？家长们。对吧。我认为这关乎所有人。我们必须确保以一种方式来完成，即他们不是去逮捕或提出指控，因为我们不希望孩子们认为他们有麻烦，每天都带着那种感觉走进学校。我们希望他们感到安全。这就是我们整个宗旨：安全和关爱的学校。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I completely agree. And I think, you know, and I'm hoping this is if my motion is passed by other trustees, that when we do have those discussions with the police and the board, I'm hoping their report can bring back, you know, what are we going to do different next time? How are we going to make sure that we're available for kids and not only the kids, but the staff, so that they feel a sense of safety as well? Parents. Right. I think it's everybody. And we have to make sure that it's done in a way that, you know, they're not there to arrest or lay charges because we don't want the kids thinking that they're in trouble and they're walking into, you know, that feeling every day. We want them to feel safe. That's what our whole motto is safe and caring schools.</p>
</details>

主持人: 就我们看到的图表而言，你提到SRO项目结束与我们所见之间存在一些联系，作为一个在学校和学生身边的人，你看到疫情后的情况有所不同。我想我们可以看看那些年发生了什么。从轶事来看，我们可以看到学生和老师们在说什么。但这两者之间有联系吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In terms of the graph that we saw there, you mentioned a little bit a connection between the end of the program and what we've seen as someone who's, you know, been around schools and. Students coming out of the pandemic, things are different. I think we can we can look at sort of, you know, what those those years have done. And anecdotally, we can we can see what students are saying and teachers are saying. But is there a connection between those two?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我不知道，我也不知道我们是否有足够的时间真正审视这些数据，你知道，2020年、2021年、2022年才过去几年。那么，仅仅是疫情的原因吗？我认为这里有很多因素需要我们考虑。而且我认为，如果这个项目真的要回来，它必须以某种方式可衡量，这样我们才能看到实际问题是什么以及它们现在为何存在。所以我真的无法对此发表评论。我认为我们仍然需要看看2024年或2025年的数据会显示什么，然后才能做出决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't know, and I don't know if we've had enough time to really look at the data, you know, 2020, 2021, 2022 was just a couple of years ago. So and is it only the pandemic? I think there's a lot of factors here that we have to consider. And I think if we do have the program come back, it has to be somehow measurable so that we can see what the actual issues are and why they're present now. So I really can't speak to that. I think we still need to see what the data shows for 2024 or 2025 and make a determination from there.</p>
</details>

### 社区反馈与系统性歧视担忧

主持人: 好的。我想读一下**安大略省人权委员会**（Ontario Human Rights Commission: 负责促进和保护人权）关于Bill 33的意见书。让我们来读一下。通过强制实施SRO项目，Bill 33削弱了教育局的权力，并阻止它们履行根据《安大略省人权法典》（Ontario Human Rights Code）保护所有学生权利的责任。这在包括皮尔区和多伦多在内的司法管辖区尤其令人担忧，因为这些地区的黑人学生和社区一直反映SRO项目带来的系统性危害。所以，这基本上就是你强调的，大卫，这项法案是否忽视了种族化社区对系统性歧视的担忧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. I want to read the Ontario Human Rights Commission's submission on Bill 33. Let's have a read there. By mandating the implementation of SRO programs, Bill 33 disempowers school boards and prevents them from filling their responsibility to protect the rights of all students under the Ontario Human Rights Code. This is particularly concerning in jurisdictions including Peel and Toronto, where black students and communities have routinely communicated the systemic harms associated with SRO programs. So pretty much what you had highlighted, David, does this bill ignore the concerns of racialized communities about systemic discrimination?</p>
</details>

David: 嗯，百分之百是。对吧。而且它正在被仓促通过立法机关。这些讨论已经发生过。它们是正在进行的讨论。SRO项目被取消后，顺便说一句，那是皮尔区警方做出的决定。不是教育局，社区成员支持了那个决定。皮尔区警方随后更进一步，与OHRC合作开展了他们称之为“人权项目”的工作。在该项目中的第12项建议非常具体地谈到了终止学校中的SRO项目和警务项目的重要性。他们制定了一个协议。对吧。所以对于认为“嘿，警察根本不应该进入学校，不安全，孩子们打架，暴力事件发生，吸电子烟等等”的普通公众成员来说。存在一个协议，我认为衡量现有协议并确定它是否最佳运作或是否需要调整是公平的。但警察是在特定情况下被邀请进入学校的。安全问题、犯罪以及其他校长、督学和学校工作人员无法解决的问题。对吧。通常这些是孩子。他们是12岁、15岁、10岁、6岁的孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, 100%. Right. And it's being rushed through the legislature. These discussions happened. They're ongoing discussions. Once the removal of the SRO program happened, by the way, that was the Peel police that made that decision. It wasn't the school board, the community members, you know, supported that decision. The Peel police then went further and partnered with the OHRC on what they called their Human Rights Project. And within that project item or recommendation 12 talks very specifically about the importance of ending the SRO programs in police programming in schools. And they have developed a protocol. Right. So for the average member of the public that thinks, hey, police aren't allowed in schools at all, it's unsafe, kids are fighting and violence is happening, vaping all of these things. There's a protocol that exists, and I think it would be fair to measure that existing protocol and determine whether it's working optimally or whether it needs to be adjusted. But police are invited into schools under specific circumstances. Safety issues, crimes and other issues that it's determined that the principals, the superintendents and the school staff can address. Right. Often these are kids. They're 12 year olds, 15 year olds, 10 year olds, 6 year olds.</p>
</details>

主持人: 警察能起到威慑作用吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Cops be a deterrent.</p>
</details>

David: 你知道吗？我的意思是，警察可能对某些事情有威慑作用，但他们也可能制造恐惧。当你想到**神经多样性学生**（neurodivergent students: 指大脑功能与典型人群存在差异的学生，如自闭症、ADHD等）、黑人和原住民学生、可能是无证件的新移民，去学校看到警察可能会对人们造成真正的创伤。还有那些与警察有过负面互动的人。所以我认为，我只想重申，在学校环境中，我们应该争取资源和资金，用于支持学生的社会情感福祉。那将是我之前列出的那些东西，对吧？更多的辅导员、更小的班级规模、额外的支持，比如儿童和青少年工作者。这些才是真正能帮助处理行为问题的专业人员。而且，你知道，引入SRO项目总是被说成“只是为了建立关系”，但它也总是在“学校不安全”的幌子下进行的。如果警察在那里，你知道，也许他们可以解决一些问题，你知道，那最终会导致，我们知道，不成比例地将边缘化群体的学生犯罪化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know? I mean, cops might be a deterrent to something, but they may create fear. When you think of, you know, neurodivergent students, black and indigenous students, newcomers that maybe are undocumented, like going to your school and seeing a cop could, you know, really be traumatizing for people. Also, people who have had negative interactions with police. So I think and I'll just reiterate, in the school environment, we should be pressing for resources and funding for things that support students social emotional well-being. And that would be the things I listed before, right? More guidance counsellors, smaller class sizes, extra supports as child and youth workers. Those are the professionals that can really help deal with behavioural issues. And, you know, the introduction of SRO programs, it's always stated as, oh, it's just to build relationships, but it's always also, you know, under the guise of schools are unsafe. And if a cops there, you know, maybe they can address some of these issues, you know, and that will end up, we know, disproportionately criminalizing students from marginalised groups.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。我想更好地了解你从家长那里听到的情况。他们是否要求通过这个项目让警察进入学校？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. With that, I want to get a better understanding of what you're hearing from parents. Are they asking for police to be on school grounds through this program?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我认为据我所知，他们中的大多数人是这样。我和其他几位理事实际上去了社区。那是在卡利登（Caledon）发生了一起事件之后，一位家长对他们孩子发生的事情非常不满，所以我们在社区发起了一份请愿书，我们只是随机选择了密西沙加、布兰普顿和卡利登的区域。我们挨家挨户地与家长交谈，有时如果他们的孩子在家，也与孩子们交谈。我们问他们，如果教育局能促成与警方就未来可能的样子进行对话，他们是否会支持这个项目？从我收集到的签名来看，大约有100个，我想我只有一个人说不。所以，你知道，但话说回来，我同意你的观点，因为它必须是一个有效的项目。它必须是可衡量的。我知道你说过，我们必须能够衡量这一点。那么我们做对了什么？我们做错了什么？如果它真的回来了，这就是我提出这项动议与工作人员和警方讨论的原因，它会是什么样子？我们将如何衡量它？也许我们一开始只在几所学校试行。也许警官不穿制服，也许他们是便衣，我不知道，但这就是我提出这项动议的原因，看看它可能是什么样子。因为现在确实有一种恐惧感。对吧？所以，很难看清大局并决定，我们应该听这个群体还是那个群体。所以，你知道，我们必须与所有人合作，确保它做得对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think from what I know, the majority of them are, we actually went out into the community, myself and a few other trustees. It was after an incident had occurred in Caledon whereby a parent was very upset about what happened to their child, and so we took a petition in the community and we just chose random areas in Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon. We went door to door and we spoke to parents, and sometimes if their kids were home, the kids too. And we asked them, we asked them, is this something that you would support if the school board could facilitate a conversation with the police about what this might look like going forward? And from the signatures that I got, which is roughly about 100, I would say, I think I had one person say no. So, you know, but again, to your point, I agree with you at the same time, because it has to be a program that works. It has to be measurable. And I know you said that we're keyword, you know, we have to be able to measure this. So what are we doing right? And what are we doing wrong. And if it does come back, and this is why I've put this motion forward to discuss this with staff and the police, what is it going to look like? How are we going to measure this? What? Maybe we just start with a couple schools at first. Maybe the officers not in uniform, maybe they're plainclothes, I don't know, but that's why I put this motion forward to see what it might look like. Because there is a sense of fear right now. Right? So and it's hard to look at the broader picture and decide, like, who do we listen to this group, this group. So, you know, we have to work with everybody to make sure that it's done right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。我应该提一下，你知道，100个签名不是一个很大的数字。但我确实想问大卫，如果大多数学生、家长和老师都希望这个项目回来，你会支持吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. I should mention, you know, 100 signatures is not a it's not a huge number. But I do want to ask David, if a majority of students, parents and teachers did want the program back, would you support it.</p>
</details>

David: 如果他们真的想让这个项目回来？不。绝对不会。原因很简单。如果你带着公平的视角进入社区，并牢记皮尔区教育局的历史和背景，它曾因不愿和无法解决具体的反黑人种族主义和其他形式的歧视而被置于监管之下。那也是在2020年。教育部的承诺和指示都围绕着公平和倾听边缘化社区人民的声音。正是这些声音将遭受伤害，而警务在这些社区的每一个例子中都造成伤害。对吧。所以我们不可能天真地认为在学校环境中，警务项目不会伤害黑人学生和其他边缘化学生。我认为大多数人站出来说“是的，我们想要警察”的想法，你需要给人们一些教育，解释历史是什么，现状是什么，我们为什么会走到这一步，安全问题是什么，以及如果存在安全问题，其他可能的解决方案是什么。你的图表显示学校中可能存在更多的暴力事件。所以我建议，让我们看看这些暴力事件发生的根本原因。让我们真正思考并有意识地解决这个问题。因为设置SRO并与警官建立关系并不能解决学生吸电子烟、学生打架、学生逃课、某些学生群体可能没有以健康的方式与他们的教育环境建立联系的原因。而且，你知道，那才是他们需要的支持。我会说一千遍，警官没有受过儿童和青少年工作者的培训，将他们引入学校。成本呢，对吧。他们的预算正在膨胀。他们说他们没有资源来处理社区中的汽车盗窃和犯罪，他们也说这些事件正在增加。他们将字面上在安大略省的多个学校中部署一名警官。我认为这没有意义。我认为我们应该就省政府可以增加什么类型的支持和资源来为学校中的每个人创造真正的安全进行建设性对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> If they did want the program back? No. Absolutely not. So, and the reason is very simple. If you go out into the community with an equity lens and keeping in mind the history and the context of the Peel District School Board that was placed under supervision because of an unwillingness and inability to address specifically anti-Black racism and other forms of discrimination. That was in 2020 as well. And the commitment and the directives from the Ministry of Education were all around equity and listening to marginalised voices of people from marginalised communities. And it's those voices that are going to experience harm, and policing creates harm in those communities in every example. Right. So we couldn't possibly be naive enough to think that in a school environment, policing programs would, you know, not harm black students and other marginalised students. And I think the idea of majorities, you know, speaking out and saying, yeah, we want police like you would have to give some education to folks and explain what the history is, what the current state is, why we got to where we got, what the safety issues are, what the other possible solutions for. You know, if there are safety issues. Your graph demonstrated that perhaps there's more violent incidents in schools. So I would suggest let's look at the root causes of these violent, you know, these occurrences of violence. And let's really think and be intentional about how do we resolve that. Because putting an SRO and building relationships with police officers does not address why students are vaping, why students are fighting, why students are skipping class, why, you know, certain groups of students perhaps are not as connected to their educational environment in healthy ways. And, you know, that's the support that they need. And I'll say it, you know, a thousand times police officers are not trained to be child and youth workers and introducing them to the school. The cost, right. Their budgets are ballooning. They're saying that they don't have the resources to deal with car theft and crime in the community, which they also say is on the rise. And they're going to literally embed a police officer, you know, in multiple schools across the province of Ontario. I don't think it makes sense. I think we should have a constructive conversation about what type of supports and resources the province can add to create real safety in schools for everybody.</p>

### 未来展望与倡导

主持人: 好的。Bill 33今天进行了最终投票。李安，我想更好地了解你的时间线。你预计SRO项目何时会在皮尔区实施？

<p class="english-text">>> All right. So Bill 33 went for a final vote today. Leanne, I want to better understand you in terms of a timeline. When do you expect the SRO program to be implemented in Peel?</p>
</details>

Leeann: 我希望我能回答这个问题，但老实说，我一无所知。我没有被告知任何事情，我也没有任何猜测。但我确实同意你所说的。如果学校能有更多的社会工作者和支持工作者，那会很棒。你说得对，这归结于资金问题，而让警察回来对教育局来说是免费的。但你提出了一个有趣的观点，即他们没有受过儿童和青少年工作者类型工作的培训。也许我们可以考虑让警察接受那种培训。

<p class="english-text">>> I wish I could answer that, and honestly, I have no idea. I haven't been told anything and I don't have any guess. But I do agree with what you said. It would be great if we could have more social workers and support workers in the school when it comes. You're right, it comes down to funding, and for us to have the police back, that's at no cost to the board. But you made an interesting point that they're not trained in child and youth worker type work. And maybe that's something that we could look at that the police get that kind of training.</p>
</details>

David: 是的，我想是这样。但我认为，你知道，假设一个被雇佣为警官的人，已经接受了武力使用训练、如何逮捕人、如何调查犯罪，那是他们的核心职能。然后在此之上再叠加一层，说“现在你要成为引导孩子做出更好决定的人，或者与孩子建立关系的人，或者在学校内部解决问题的人”。我认为我们忽略了这样一个事实：有专业人士专门从事这项工作，他们上学就是为了与孩子一起工作，帮助和支持他们。而那些才是我们学校需要的人。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I think so. But I think that, you know, assuming that a police officer who's been hired to be a police officer has been put through, you know, use of force training, how to arrest people, how to investigate crimes, that is their core function. And then layering on top of that and saying, now you're going to become, you know, the person that guides children into better decisions or builds relationships with children or, you know, disrupts problems within the school. I think we're missing the point that there are people who are professional at this who went to school to be to work with children and to help and support them. And those are the people that we need in the schools.</p>

主持人: 大卫，你来做最后的总结。如果可以的话，你如何改变政府在这个问题上的立场？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> David, you get the last word on this. if you could, how do you change the government's position on this?</p>
</details>

David: 嗯，已经有很多倡导活动了。你知道，我们现在的政治环境与2020年不同，但在2020年，我们看到，教育局，特别是皮尔区教育局被置于监管之下，教育部部长发布了指令，要求开始解决存在的、并持续存在的系统性反黑人种族主义。所以，你知道，这是倡导，是像“无警学校”（policing free schools）、“男孩与权力”（Boys and Powers）、皮尔黑人集体（Peel Black Collective）这样的团体。有很多团体正在教育和动员社区成员，让他们真正理解这个问题，因为如果没有理解这个问题，我认为，公平地说，那些支持警察重返学校的人，他们希望自己的孩子安全。而这正是被提议用来保障他们安全的唯一方案。所以，让我们进行更广泛的讨论，关于从长远来看，什么能为学校里的孩子和教职员工，为所有人创造安全。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Well, there's been a ton of advocacy. you know, we're not in a political environment that is the same as we were in 2020, but in 2020, we saw, you know, boards played the particularly appeal board placed under supervision directives issued, by the Minister of Education to, you know, begin to address the systemic anti-Black racism that existed, and continues to exist. And so, you know, it's advocacy, it's groups like policing free schools, Boys and Powers, Peel Black Collective. There's a whole bunch of groups out there that are educating and mobilizing community members to, you know, really understand this issue because without understanding the issue, I think, you know, in fairness to the folks that say yes to, you know, police back in schools, you know, they want their kids to be safe. And this is what's being proposed to keep them safe and nothing else. So let's have a broader discussion about what, you know, long term, going to create safety in schools for children and for staff, for everybody.</p>

主持人: 好的。我们就到这里。李安，大卫，非常感谢你们的真知灼见。我相信这将是我们密切关注的对话。所以非常感谢你们的时间。
