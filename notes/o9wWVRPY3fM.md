### 节目介绍

**Rosie**: 我是 Rosie Garren，您正在收听的是 **《连线》杂志的播客节目**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I'm Rosie Garren and you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.

</details>

**Rosie**: 大家好，我是 Rosie。在我们上一期节目中，我和 Christine 与 **《连线》杂志的编辑总监 Margarite Preston** 聊了聊在家升级咖啡装备所需的工具。我们讨论了咖啡研磨机、不同的冲煮方法以及其他能让你冲出理想风味早晨咖啡的技巧。所以，如果你还没听过，快去听听吧。但有一件制作一杯好咖啡的重要元素，我们当时没时间详谈，那就是**咖啡豆**本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Hey there, it's Rosie. In our last episode, Christine and I talked with Wire Cutter editorial director Margarite Preston about the gear you need to upgrade your coffee setup at home. We covered grinders, different brewing methods, and other techniques to develop the flavor you want in your morning brew. So, go check that out if you haven't heard it. But there was one important element of a great cup of coffee we didn't have time to talk about, and that's the coffee beans themselves.

</details>

### 咖啡豆基础

**Rosie**: 每一杯咖啡都始于一颗成熟的咖啡樱桃，它是咖啡植物的果实。这种植物的种子被采摘、干燥、烘焙，然后包装成咖啡豆。咖啡生产过程中的每一步，都有可能改变最终咖啡的风味。从你种植的咖啡品种到烘焙咖啡豆的温度。老实说，我觉得这有点令人不知所措。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Every cup of coffee starts off as a ripe coffee cherry, the fruit of the coffee plant. The seeds of that plant get harvested, dried, roasted, and packaged up as coffee beans. Every step of the coffee production process is an opportunity to change the way a cup eventually will taste. From the type of coffee plant you grow to the temperature at which you roast the beans. To be honest, I find that a bit overwhelming.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我多年来一直是个想成为咖啡鉴赏家的人，但在超市或当地咖啡店里，我仍然难以理解咖啡豆包装袋背面的那些说明。我该如何尝试新品牌或新咖啡烘焙商，同时又能确信自己会喜欢它的味道呢？为了弄清楚这一点，我将通过“咖啡101”课程向 Sum Nai 学习。Sum 是 **Coffee Project New York** 的联合创始人，该公司最初是纽约东村的一家咖啡店，现已扩展到烘焙、批发、零售和教育领域。Sum 还是一位**认证的 Q Grader**，我刚了解到这相当于葡萄酒界的侍酒师。所以，休息过后，Sum 将告诉我如何购买能冲泡出我喜爱的咖啡的咖啡豆。请继续收听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I've been a wannabe coffee snob for years and I still struggle at the grocery store or at my local coffee shop deciphering the words on the back of a bag of beans. How do I experiment with new brands or new coffee roasters and still have confidence that I'm actually going to like the taste? So to understand that, I'm going through coffee 101 with Sum Nai. Sum is co-founder of Coffee Project New York which began as a coffee shop in New York's East Village and it has since expanded into roasting wholesale retail education. Sum also happens to be a certified Q Grader which I've just learned is essentially the equivalent of a sommelier in wine. So after the break some's going to tell me about how to buy coffee beans that will end up in a cup of coffee I love. So stick around.

</details>

### 嘉宾的咖啡之旅

**Rosie**: 我们回来了，咖啡专家、**Coffee Project New York** 联合创始人 Sum。Sum，欢迎来到《连线》杂志的播客节目。非常高兴能请到你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: We're back with S Guy, coffee expert and co-founder of Coffee Project New York. Sum, welcome to the Wire Cutter Show. So happy to have you.

</details>

**Sum**: 谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Thanks for having me.

</details>

**Rosie**: 谢谢你来这里。嗯，我的第一个问题是，你是如何、为何、何时爱上咖啡的？我来自马来西亚，在那里出生长大，那里的咖啡文化非常盛行。比如，我们会随时随地出去闲逛、喝咖啡，从早上 7 点到凌晨 2 点，因为它就像是我们聚在一起聊天交流的媒介。我真正爱上**精品咖啡**的那部分，直到我搬到纽约市才开始。我当时想建立一个像我在马来西亚家乡那样的空间，让人们可以进来聚会，喝他们想喝的东西。然而，我意识到，一旦我开始做生意，我就越深入地研究咖啡这种饮品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Thank you for being here. Um, my first question is how, why, when did you fall in love with coffee? I'm from Malaysia, born and raised, and coffee culture there, it's a big thing. Like, we would go hang out, drink coffee at any time of the day, 7:00 a.m. to like 2:00 a.m. in the morning because it's just like a medium for us to get together and talk about things. My love for actual like the specialty coffee side of things didn't really happen until I moved to New York City. I wanted to actually build the space like what I have back home in Malaysia for people to come in and gather drinking whatever that they want. However, I realized that as soon as I start the business, me diving deeper and deeper into coffee as a beverage.

</details>

**Sum**: 是的。现在它变成了咖啡作为一种水果，然后整个咖啡文化，包括人、生产者以及我们汇聚的这些人，对我来说发生了很大的变化，从一开始它仅仅是作为一种社交媒介。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Yeah. And now it become coffee as the fruit and then the whole coffee culture is the people the producer and all these people that we're bringing together changed a lot for me from the beginning itself where it is just the barriage as a medium of connection.

</details>

### 如何选豆：风味优先

**Rosie**: 好的。所以你显然对咖啡有非常非常深入的了解。我们要请你把话题拉回到最基础的层面，就像你在跟好奇的初学者讲解一样。那么，如何才能选到你带回家后会喜欢的咖啡豆呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Okay. So you obviously have a very very deep knowledge of coffee. We're going to ask you to dial it way way way back like you're talking to curious noviceses. So, how do you choose beans you know you'll like when you get home?

</details>

**Sum**: 嗯，我认为首先要做的是看看咖啡豆包装袋上列出的**风味描述**。我倾向于先看风味或风味特征，因为这会让你更愿意尝试来自不同产地的咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: So, I think the first thing is maybe look at the bag of coffee and see some of these flavor calls that is listed on the back. I prefer to go with the flavor first or the profile first because then it opens up your mind about trying different coffees from different origin.

</details>

### 理解风味描述

**Rosie**: 我想稍微聊聊这些**风味描述**以及你在咖啡包装袋上看到的一些词语。比如，如果看到“巧克力味”，那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I want to talk a little bit about these tasting notes and some of the words that you see on on a bag of coffee. If you see chocolatey as a as an example, what does that mean?

</details>

**Sum**: 很多时候这是一种**印象**。咖啡包装袋告诉你，你可能会尝到的第一种味道是什么。咖啡本身是一种水果。所以它固有的风味特征，要么是**果味**，要么是**草本味**，要么是**花香**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: A lot of times it's an impression. The bag of coffee tells you what is the first thing that you might be tasting. Coffee itself is a fruit. So the innate flavor call that you get from it, it's going to be either fruity or something herbaceious or floral.

</details>

**Rosie**: 好的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Okay?

</details>

**Sum**: 或者两者的结合。但当你看到咖啡包装袋上有巧克力、榛子、红糖这样的风味描述时，这些都是我们在把咖啡豆放进烘焙机开始烘焙时发生的**化学反应**。比如咖啡豆中的糖分发生焦糖化反应。这让你联想到它的味道像巧克力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Or a combination of both. But when you see a bag of coffee that you have notes like chocolate, hazelnuts, brown sugar, these are all the chemical reaction that's happening when we put the seed into a roaster and start roasting them. So it's the sugar in the city itself browning to a certain reaction. It reminds you of how it tastes like chocolate.

</details>

**Rosie**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Yeah.

</details>

**Sum**: 榛子或者嗯红糖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Hazelnut or um brown sugar.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我见过樱桃味、苹果味。我见过很多不同的东西，我一直想知道那是什么意思。所以，这些风味是在咖啡豆被烘焙时产生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I've seen cherry. I've seen apple. I've seen so many different things and I've always wondered what that means. So that manifests when the beans are being roasted.

</details>

**Sum**: 正确。从技术上讲，当咖啡豆被烘焙时，会发生化学反应，热量会改变咖啡豆中的某些成分，形成一种你可能在草莓中也找到的化合物。所以，当我们一起吃草莓时，我们知道它尝起来像草莓，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Correct. So um technically speaking like whenever the coffee is getting roasted chemical reaction happen and the heat change some component in the beans itself to a compound that you might also find in let's say strawberry. So when we both eat a strawberry together, we know it tastes like strawberry, right?

</details>

**Rosie**: 但我不知道你的草莓尝起来是什么味道，你也不知道我的草莓尝起来是什么味道，但我们都知道我们在尝到草莓味，因为我们有过品尝它们的经验。烘焙方面是这样的：如果这款咖啡有草莓的印象，那么很可能咖啡本身含有一种化合物，让你联想到你吃草莓时尝到的草莓味，以及其他化合物。所以，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: But I don't know how your strawberry tastes and you will not know how my strawberry tastes, but we both know that we're tasting strawberry because we have experience having them. with the roasting side of things is if this coffee has impression of strawberry, highly likely there is a compound in the beverage itself that reminds you of the strawberry that you had in the other compound when you're eating a strawberry. So,

</details>

**Sum**: 所以这一切都非常主观，因为对我来说，咖啡豆包装上的草莓味很可能和我品尝到的草莓味不同，或者说，你品尝到的草莓味和我品尝到的草莓味会不一样，无论那是什么样的草莓。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: so this is all incredibly subjective because notes of strawberry to me in a bag of coffee are is very likely going to be different or different on my palette than it will be on yours, whatever that strawberry is.

</details>

**Rosie**: 正确。所以，每当我教课或者在咖啡包装袋上看到风味描述时，我们经常会努力保持**品鉴校准**。我们会知道，比如，如果这袋咖啡尝起来像草莓，那么我的草莓味和你尝到的草莓味会大致相同，因为我们都经历过我们称之为**咖啡词典**或**风味轮**的训练，我们一起进行了大量的味觉校准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Correct. So uh whenever I am teaching a class or I'm like getting a note uh on the back of coffee a lot of times we try to stay calibrated. We will know like if let's say this bag of coffee tastes like strawberry then my strawberry and your strawberry will somewhat be the same because we have experience with what we call the coffee lexicon or the flavor wheel where we do a bunch of pallet calibration together.

</details>

### 品鉴校准与风味轮

**Rosie**: 你能解释一下这个过程吗？我听说过，也读过一些，但我很想让你描绘一下它的样子。这个校准过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Can you explain this process? I've I've heard of it. I've read a little bit about it, but I'm I would love for you to kind of paint a picture of what that looks like. The calibration process.

</details>

**Sum**: 偶尔，我们会召集一些团队成员，买来各种香料、水果，一起品尝，并从根本上确定我们正在吃的东西。比如，以青柠为例。当我拿到一个青柠，切开它，开始品尝。我们不会只说“酸”，而是深入到五种基本味觉：甜、酸、苦、鲜味和咸味。当我们一起做这样的练习时，我们会从香气、芬芳开始记录，也就是从闻它们开始。我记得做这个练习时，第一次意识到，单独的青柠不仅仅是尖锐、明亮和酸涩的。它其实是带点咸味的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Once in a while, we gather some of our team members and we buy a bunch of spices, fruits, and we eat it together and try to pinpoint the product that we're eating from ground level. So, take a lime and as an example. So, when I have a lime, I cut it open and I start eating it. Instead of just saying like a sour, we're diving into the five basic tastes. Sweet, sour, bitter, umami, and salty. When we do an exercise like that together, we write down from aroma, fragrance, which is we start from smelling them. And I remember doing this exercise and realized for the very first time, lime on its own is not just sharp, bright, and acidic. It's actually salty.

</details>

**Rosie**: 呃。然后我们会调整我们的感受，使之相互匹配，同时解释为什么我会这样品尝。这就是我们在专业场合保持校准的方式。但是，我们如何与那些喜欢我们的咖啡但又不是咖啡专业人士的人保持校准呢？这时你就会看到一些咖啡包装上写着，它的味道像 **Jolly Rancher**（一种糖果），像**棉花糖**。这些词语更常见，人们更容易理解和联想到。而且也更有趣，我个人认为也更不吓人。所以，如果我拿到一袋尝起来像 **Fruity Pebbles**（一种谷物麦片）的咖啡，我就会确信，哦，这是一种混合了多种水果的味道，尝起来像红色的 **Sun-Maid**（葡萄干品牌），那么我知道它会带点酒味，还有很多红葡萄的味道，这比直接说“这款咖啡尝起来像橙子、草莓和猕猴桃”要容易理解。我认为，冲泡后，品尝它，再看看标签，有助于你理解它的风味。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Huh. And then we would tone down our levels to match each other and at the same time would explain why I would taste this this way. So this is how we stay calibrated in the professional setting. However, how do we stay calibrated with people who enjoy our coffee that is not in coffee? And that's when you see bags of coffee that says that it tastes like Jolly Rancher, tastes like a cotton candy. So these are terms that it's a little bit more common that people can actually figure it out and also think about it and it's also more fun and personally I think it's less scary. So if I get a bag of coffee that tastes like Fruity Pebbles, I'll know for sure that oh it's a mixed bag of fruits, tastes like a red sunre, then I know it's going to be a little bit boozy and also like a lot of like red grape compared to like if you want to go straight into like this coffee tastes like orange, strawberry and kiwi. I think after brewing it, sipping it and looking at the label helped you understand the flavor.

</details>

### 整豆 vs. 咖啡粉

**Rosie**: 我在买咖啡的时候，应该买**整豆**还是**研磨好的咖啡粉**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: When I'm buying coffee, should I be buying whole bean or ground?

</details>

**Sum**: 我认为**整豆**永远是首选，因为一旦你磨碎了咖啡，你就大大暴露了咖啡的内部。所以，它会更快地**脱气**、**变质**，即使你储存它们。但还有一个非常实际的原因，为什么你不应该提前研磨咖啡，是因为你不知道你想如何冲煮它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: I think whole bean is always the go-to because once you ground the coffee, you're exposing the coffee areas a lot more. So, chances of it degassing, getting still is a lot quicker even though you still them. But that's a very practical reason of why you do not want to grind your coffee ahead of time is because you don't know how you want to brew it.

</details>

**Rosie**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Mhm.

</details>

**Sum**: 所以，比如说你有一袋咖啡，你预先磨好了，或者你买的是预磨好的，它就只能适合做**滤泡咖啡**。你将无法进行任何调整，或者说无法适应不同的冲煮风格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: So if let's say you are you have a bag of coffee and you preground or you bought it pregrown, there's only going to be good for like filter. You won't be able to make any adjustment or like cater it to a different brew style.

</details>

### 烘焙日期解读

**Rosie**: 另一个我一直很好奇的术语是**烘焙日期**。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Another term I've been curious about roast date. M

</details>

**Rosie**: 它相对于我购买、制作和饮用咖啡有什么意义？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: what does that mean relative to my buying and then making and drinking a cup of coffee?

</details>

**Sum**: 所以，当我们谈论烘焙日期时，它指的是咖啡豆烘焙完成并包装好的技术日期。这个日期告诉你咖啡的新鲜度。当你拿到一袋非常新鲜的咖啡，比如昨天刚烘焙好，你马上就冲煮它，结果不一定最好，因为咖啡在烘焙完成后还有很多变化。所以，我们希望它有一个**静置期**。这也是我们为什么要注意烘焙日期的原因之一。烘焙日期后你越早冲煮咖啡，就越难萃取出咖啡的风味。所以它不会像在包装袋里放了 5 天或更久的咖啡那样好喝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: So when we talk about roast date is uh technically when is the beans getting roasted and finished and packaging. That date tells you the freshness. When you have a back of coffee that is super fresh. Let's say it's roasted yesterday and you brew it right away. it's not always going to be the best results because there are still a lot of things going on with the coffee after we finish roasting. So, what we like is to have a rest period. And that's one of the reason why we want to pay attention to the roast date. The sooner you brew your coffee after the roast date, it's actually harder for you to extract the coffee. So it will not taste as good as if the coffee has been sitting in the bag for 5 days or more.

</details>

**Rosie**: 风味不会那么醇厚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: The flavors won't be as deep.

</details>

**Sum**: 是的。嗯，不仅如此，你可能会尝到很多**烟熏味**、**气泡感**或者我们称之为**草味**，这都是刚烘焙完不久的。有时我们一起杯测咖啡时，如果咖啡太新鲜，一个非常常见的风味描述是**烤牛肉味**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Yes. Um not only that, you might get a lot of like smokiness, gassiness or what we call like grassiness um right after roast. And sometimes when we cup coffee together, a very common flavor call that we'll be getting if the coffee is way too fresh is roasted beef.

</details>

**Rosie**: 哦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: O

</details>

**Sum**: 是的。嗯，所以一旦它静置并“打开”了，你就能从咖啡中获得更多好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: yes. Um, so as soon as it rest and open up, you'll get a lot more benefit from the beverage itself.

</details>

**Rosie**: 那么，简单来说，你通常需要等多久？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: So in terms of short hand, how long generally are you going to want to wait?

</details>

**Sum**: 理想情况下是 **7 天**。经验法则是，如果你是浅度烘焙，它需要更长的静置期会更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Ideally 7 days. Rule of thumb is if you have a lighter roast, chances of it resting longer is going to be better.

</details>

### 烘焙程度区分

**Rosie**: 你能简要解释一下浅度、中度、深度烘焙的区别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Can you briefly explain the differences between light, medium, and dark roasts?

</details>

**Sum**: 浅度、中度和深度烘焙，嗯，是我们看到的咖啡豆本身的颜色。这非常非常主观，因为别人的深度烘焙可能是别人的中度烘焙。但是，我喜欢看到的是，当人们谈论浅度、中度和深度烘焙时，这几乎总是体现在咖啡包装袋上的风味描述中。所以，**浅度烘焙**的咖啡，你总会在包装袋上看到很多草本、花香和果味。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: light, medium and dark rose is uh when we see the color of the beans itself very very subjective because somebody's dark rose can be somebody's medium rose however uh what I like to see when someone is talking about light medium and dark roses it is almost always reflected in the way that the back of coffee has the calls. So light roast coffee you will always see a lot of herbaceious floral and fruit notes in the back.

</details>

**Rosie**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Okay.

</details>

**Sum**: **中度烘焙**的咖啡，你会看到更多的果味，但同时也会有一些红糖、香草或煮熟的浆果的味道。所以，想象一下菠萝或桃子，你把它放在烤架上烤的那种感觉。那就是你的中度烘焙。如果是**深度烘焙**，留意焦糖、黑巧克力、烤榛子、杏仁等风味描述。这些都表明了烘焙程度。只要你尝不到烧焦或极度的苦涩味，深度烘焙的咖啡就很适合做**奶咖**，或者也许那就是你早上需要提神的咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Medium roast of coffee you will see a little bit more of the fruit but at the same time you get some sort of brown sugar like vanilla or like cooked berries. So like think about pineapple or peach that you throw it on top of a grill kind. So that will be your medium roast. And if it's a dark rose, look out for notes like caramel, dark chocolate, roasted hazelnut, almonds. These are all sign that can tell you a little bit more on that. As long as you're not tasting burnt or extreme bitterness from the dark roast itself, it will be great as a milk barriage or maybe that is the cup of coffee that you need to wake you up in the morning.

</details>

### 产地与风味

**Rosie**: 有哪些方法可以根据咖啡豆的产地来判断它的风味？嗯，这正是我觉得非常迷人的地方。我喜欢不同产地咖啡的风味。所以，来自**亚洲产区**的咖啡，由于海拔原因，通常**酸度较低**。而来自**美洲产区**的咖啡，酸度会**更温和**，带有更多的**香料味**，比如苹果等风味。然后，来自**非洲产区**的咖啡会更**明亮**、**果味更浓**、**花香更重**。这些都是经典的分类，但现在很多情况都在变化，人们在**发酵技术**上越来越有创意，这总是让我感到惊喜。所以，大约两三周前，我喝了一杯咖啡。那实际上是一杯来自印度尼西亚的咖啡。我喝的时候，它的味道几乎像高海拔产区的哥伦比亚咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: What are some of the ways you can determine the taste of coffee beans based on where they're from? M this is exactly where gets very fascinating for me. I love how coffee tastes in different region. So coffee from the Asian region a lot of times is going to be lower acidity because of the elevation and then coffee from the Americas is going to be a little bit more mild in acidity and more spice forward notes of apple and things like that and then coffee from the African region will be brighter fruier more floral so these are all the classic but there's a lot of things changing right now and people are getting more and more creative with fermentation technique and it throws me off all the time. So, I have a cup of coffee just maybe two to 3 weeks ago. It is actually a cup of coffee from Indonesia. When I had it, it tastes like almost an high elevation Colombia

</details>

**Sum**: 这是因为他们采用了**厌氧天然处理法**。所以，虽然我们都有一些基础来判断风味，但现在情况变得越来越复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: because of the anorobic natural process that are putting on to it. So while we all have something to ground us to the taste, now things are getting more and more complex.

</details>

### 超市购豆指南

**Rosie**: 好的。那假设我在超市买咖啡豆。我在货架前，有这么多不同的选择。当你抬头看、低头看，试图去拿一袋整豆咖啡时，你的一般指导建议是什么？我应该看什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Okay. So let's say I buy my coffee beans at the grocery store. I'm in the aisle. There are so many different options. What is your general guidance when you're looking up and down and trying to reach for a bag of whole bean coffee? What do I look for

</details>

**Sum**: 当你在超市购买咖啡时？我认为第一件事是，选择你喜欢它风味的咖啡，以及它适合的冲煮方法和烘焙程度。然后之后，你可以看看那些可能让你感兴趣的产区。你想看到一些常见的，或者不常见的，是拼配豆还是**单一产地豆**。最后，可能是**烘焙日期**。你不想买那种在货架上放了 6 个月或更久的咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: when you're buying coffee in a grocery store? I think the first thing is uh pick the coffee that you like how it tastes, the brew method it's roasted for and then after that you can look into regions that might excite you. You want to see something that is very common or not common if it's a blend or it's a single origin and finally probably is the roast date. You don't want to have something that has been sitting on a shelf for like 6 months or something like that.

</details>

**Rosie**: 而且你希望它上面有烘焙日期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: And also you want you it needs to have a roast date.

</details>

**Sum**: 是的。我认为几乎每一袋咖啡上都会有烘焙日期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sum**: Yes. I think highly likely you will see a roast date on each and every bag of coffee.

</details>
