title: AI时代：职业阶梯的消亡与新一代的生存突围
---
### 职业阶梯的崩塌：从“学位即门票”到“技能即生存”

几十年来，全球年轻一代都相信一个清晰的承诺：只要进入大学——哪怕背负一些债务——就能获得一张通往中产阶级的入场券。这张门票意味着一份白领工作、高于非毕业生的薪资，以及最终实现房产拥有权的机会。但如今，这张承诺已被打破——昔日的“黄金门票”，不过是学生贷款上一张10%折扣券。

<p class="english-text">For decades, a clear promise defined the aspirations of young adults worldwide. If you went to university—even if you accumulated some debt—you got a ticket to the middle class. That ticket guaranteed a white-collar job and a salary premium over non-graduates. It also paved the way to homeownership. That promise has been broken – the golden ticket turned out to just be a coupon for 10% off a student loan.</p>
</details>

我们正见证一场罕见的经济转型。通常，经济增长会奖励那些为教育投入努力的人；但如今，经济在扩张的同时，大学毕业生的就业大门却在关闭。2024年5月，牛津经济研究院报告称：这是45年来美国近期大学毕业生的失业率首次超过全国平均水平。虽然这并不算灾难——因为美国整体失业率仍接近历史低位——但这一逆转已具有标志性意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are witnessing a rare economic shift. A growing economy usually rewards the effort taken to get an education. Yet today, the economy has been expanding while the door for graduate employment has been closing. In May 2024, Oxford Economics reported a statistic that defines this new era. For the first time in 45 years, the unemployment rate for recent university graduates in the United States exceeded the national average. Now while this is not great - it is by no means a disaster - as US unemployment - while rising is still hovering near all-time lows.</p>
</details>

这种逆转部分源于供给端的剧变。1960年，英国仅有约5%的年轻人上大学；到2007年，这一比例飙升至43%。美国也经历了类似趋势：1960年拥有学位的成年人占比为7.7%，到2023年已接近38%。曾经是精英能力稀缺信号的学位，如今已成为基本期望。当稀缺性消失，薪资溢价也随之蒸发。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This inversion is partly a story of supply. In 1960, only about 5 percent of young people in the UK went to university. By 2007, that figure had risen to 43 percent. The United States saw a similar trajectory, with the share of adults holding a degree jumping from 7.7 percent in 1960 to nearly 38 percent in 2023. The degree - which was once a rare signal of elite capability, has become a baseline expectation. As scarcity disappeared, so did the pay premium.</p>
</details>

不仅毕业生数量激增，成绩通胀也在加剧。以英国为例：上世纪90年代中期，获得一等学位的学生比例仅为7%，如今已升至26%。这种成绩通胀的问题在于——当每个人都“特别”，就没人真正特别了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is not just the number of graduates that have been growing either, there has been grade inflation too. In the UK, for example - the proportion of students awarded a First-Class degree went from 7 percent in the mid-90s to 26 percent today. The problem with grade inflation like this is that - if everyone is special, no one is.</p>

### 就业市场的冻结：AI、工资与结构性断层

2025年9月，美国20至24岁人群的失业率飙升至9.2%，远高于一年前的7%。彭博社数据显示，拥有四年制学位的美国人如今占所有失业劳动者比例超过25%，创下历史新高，甚至高于2020年3月疫情期间的峰值。为了“原地不动”，毕业生们必须疯狂投递简历：英国高飞研究公司（High Fliers Research）发现，2025年2月，英国应届毕业生平均每人投出21.7份申请——几乎是2023年的两倍，但成功率却跌至三十年来最低点，仅27%的学生在该月已锁定工作。关键行业如人力资源、营销和会计的毕业生岗位数量分别下降了78%、46%和42%。与此同时，去年英国仍有超过46.5万名学生完成本科学业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In September 2025, unemployment among 20–24-year-olds in the United States hit 9.2 percent, rising sharply from 7 percent a year earlier. Broader data from Bloomberg reveals that Americans with four-year degrees now account for more than 25 percent of all unemployed workers. This ratio has climbed to an all-time high, surpassing even the temporary peak reached during the pandemic layoffs of March 2020. The crisis can be seen in the frantic activity required to just stand still. According to High Fliers Research, final-year students in the UK now make an average of 21.7 job applications each. This nearly doubles the number of applications made just two years ago in 2023 - yet success rates have plummeted to their lowest levels in three decades. Only 27 percent of UK final-year students had a job lined up by February 2025, down from 33 percent two years earlier. Graduate job postings have plummeted in key sectors: falling 78 percent in human resources, 46 percent in marketing, and 42 percent in accounting. While this is happening - the supply of graduates keeps rising, with over 465,000 finishing their first degree in the UK last year.</p>

金融时报首席数据记者约翰·伯恩-穆尔多克指出，这一新图景最引人注目的特征是性别分化。毕业生招聘的崩溃对年轻男性打击最大。

<p class="english-text">John Burn-Murdoch, the chief data reporter at the FT, highlights that the most striking feature of this new landscape is the gendered nature of the divide. The collapse in graduate hiring has hit young men the hardest.</p>
</details>

美国详细的就业数据显示，过去一年中，男性毕业生失业率从不足5%跃升至7%，而女性毕业生的失业率则保持稳定。去年，女性新增了13.5万个就业岗位，其中仅医疗行业就增加了近5万个。男性则集中于科技与金融领域——这些行业在疫情期间疯狂招聘后，正大规模裁撤初级岗位，并积极拥抱自动化。大型语言模型如今能完成过去由年轻男性负责的任务：编写基础代码、分析电子表格、管理数据。彭博社上月报道称，OpenAI已聘请了100多名前投资银行家，训练其人工智能如何构建金融模型，以替代全行业初级银行家的重复性劳动。

<p class="english-text">Detailed employment data from the US reveals that the unemployment rate for recent male graduates has jumped from under 5 percent to 7 percent over the last year. For female graduates, the rate remains unchanged. Women gained 135,000 jobs last year, including nearly 50,000 in healthcare alone. Men cluster in fields like tech and finance. These sectors have been purging entry-level roles after pandemic-era hiring binges. They are also aggressively embracing automation. Large Language Models now perform tasks young men were once hired to do, such as writing basic code, analyzing spreadsheets, and managing data. Bloomberg reported last month that OpenAI had hired more than 100 ex-investment bankers to train its AI on how to build financial models as it looks to replace the hours of grunt work performed by junior bankers across the industry.</p>

### 信任的崩塌：AI如何摧毁招聘系统

这项技术变革正在瓦解整个招聘流程。生成式AI让求职者能一键批量发送数百封定制化求职信和简历。《经济学人》指出，过去一份出色的求职信能帮助雇主区分高质量与低质量申请人；如今，面对海量无法分辨的申请材料，招聘方已失去筛选能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This technological shift towards AI has started breaking the hiring process too. Generative AI allows applicants to spam hundreds of custom cover letters and resumes out to hiring firms with a single click. The Economist describes how a good cover letter - used to help distinguish between high- and low-quality applicants. Employers - now flooded with indistinguishable applications, struggle to differentiate between candidates.</p>
</details>

这引发了经典的“柠檬问题”——经济学家乔治·阿克洛夫（George Akerlof）于1970年提出的概念。在阿克洛夫模型中，当买家无法区分高质量商品（桃子）与低质量商品（柠檬——美国俚语，指买后才发现有缺陷的汽车），他们因害怕买到“柠檬”而压低出价，导致优质卖家退出市场，最终只剩劣质品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This creates a classic "lemons problem," a concept introduced by the economist George Akerlof in 1970. In Akerlof’s model, when buyers can’t distinguish between high-quality goods (or peaches) and low-quality goods (lemons – a slang term in America for a car that’s found to be defective after it has been bought.), their fear of buying a lemon drives down the price they are willing to pay. This drives sellers of high-quality goods out of the market, leaving only lemons.</p>
</details>

在毕业生就业市场中，“商品”就是求职申请。当雇主面对成千上万份由AI生成、毫无差别的求职信时，他们无法识别那些真正投入时间与精力的优质候选人。信号被噪音淹没。正如买家不再购买二手车，雇主也正在关闭公开招聘流程，转而依赖线下人脉与裙带关系——因为如今唯一可靠的信号，只剩下个人介绍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the graduate job market, the "goods" are job applications. When employers are flooded with thousands of AI-generated, indistinguishable cover letters, they lose the ability to identify the high-quality candidates who invested time and effort. The signal is drowned out by noise. Just as buyers in Akerlof's market stopped buying used cars, employers are stopping the open hiring process. They retreat to offline networks and nepotism to find people they feel they can trust. The issue is that if everyone sounds perfect on paper, the only signal left is a personal introduction.</p>
</details>

### 技能的鸿沟：从“实习训练”到“即时价值”

过去，职场培训依赖重复劳动：初级律师花数年审查合同、会计师核对审计日志、投行新人多年构建Excel模型和PPT提案。这些枯燥工作虽乏味，却至关重要——它们不仅让新人证明自己，更教会他们如何胜任工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the job training - has long depended on repetitive work. Junior lawyers spent their first few years reviewing thousands of pages of contracts while accountants checked audit logs. Junior investment bankers spent years building excel models and PowerPoint slideshows for pitches. This work – while tedious - served a critical function. By grinding through this repetitive work for years – juniors both proved themselves and learned how to do their job well.</p>
</details>

人工智能正切断这一链条。据《金融时报》报道，英国国际律师事务所Simmons & Simmons已部署名为“Percy”的定制AI工具处理文件审查与法律摘要。可以想象，Percy首先学会的是如何把免责声明字体调小到比正文还短——其次才是“如何在24小时内开26小时账单”。Percy已是合伙人材料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Artificial Intelligence has started to sever this link. According to the FT, at Simmons & Simmons, - a UK based international law firm - a custom AI tool named "Percy" now handles document review and legal summarization. Presumably, the first thing Percy worked out was how to make a font size small enough so the disclaimer doesn’t seem longer than the document and the second was 'How to bill 26 hours in a 24-hour day. Percy’s already partner material.</p>
</details>

如今，新人已从“执行者”演变为“校验者”，负责验证AI输出的准确性。但审查合同是否严谨、代码是否安全，需要的是判断力——而刚毕业的学生几乎不具备这种能力。洞察力源于经验，但企业越来越不愿提供这种培养机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of the basic tasks that AI is being used for at law firms once taught “the trade” to fleets of trainee lawyers. Juniors have now begun evolving from "doers" generating first drafts into "checkers" verifying AI output. But verifying the soundness of a contract or the security of a piece of code requires judgment – and the problem is that fresh graduates rarely possess this skill. Discernment requires experience – but companies are increasingly reluctant to provide that experience.</p>

### 经济不确定性与“薪资地板”的陷阱

技术变革只是加剧压力的因素之一。它与其他宏观力量共同构成完美风暴，使新员工成为潜在的财务负担。

<details>

<p class="english-text">New technology is just one factor compounding the pressure on young job seekers. It joins a perfect storm of macroeconomic forces that make novice employees - a potential financial liability.</p>

美国作为全球最大消费市场，企业正面对不断变化的关税规则：他们不知道原材料成本、消费者是否接受涨价、利润率能否维持。外国企业则担心能否出口，或是否因中国出口转移而面临更激烈的国内竞争。当公司无法预判成本与需求时，便会冻结决策——推迟重大投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firms are dealing with constantly changing tariff rules in the United States - the biggest consumer market in the world. American firms don't know what their raw materials will cost or if the consumer will accept higher prices - they have no idea what their margins will be if they might have to swallow some of the cost increase. Foreign firms don't know if they will be able to export at all, or if they’ll face higher competition in their domestic markets from redirected Chinese exports. When a company has no visibility as to what their costs will be or what demand will look like, they often freeze up. They postpone big decisions until they have greater visibility. The constantly changing nature of these tariffs makes the situation particularly difficult for businesses - and is likely reducing growth both at US-based firms and international firms.</p>
</details>

高盛近期分析进一步印证了这一悲观前景：10月私营部门裁员公告达到历史非衰退期峰值，WARN通知（企业大规模裁员前必须提交的文件）数量也升至2016年以来最高。尽管初期失业申请仍低，但这些先行指标表明美国劳动力市场正在弱化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Recent analysis from Goldman Sachs adds weight to this gloomy outlook. Their researchers found that private-sector layoff announcements in October reached their highest level on record outside of a recession. Furthermore, WARN notices—which companies must file before mass layoffs—have ticked up to levels not seen since 2016. While initial jobless claims remain low, these leading indicators suggest the US labor market is weakening.</p>
</details>

这种不确定性催生了“大冻结”：企业采用“低招聘、低裁员”的“Job Hugging”模式，现有员工不愿离职，导致晋升通道堵塞，初级岗位更难打开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of this uncertainty has led to a "great freeze" in the broader job market. We are seeing a "low-hire, low-fire" dynamic – which has been termed “Job Hugging” - where incumbent employees stay put, reducing the churn that typically opens up entry-level spots at firms. With quit rates falling, the ladder is getting blocked somewhat from the top down.</p>
</details>

全球多国政府为应对生活成本危机而提高最低工资。尽管美国联邦最低工资仍低，但多个州已大幅上调。《经济学人》指出，学者们最近开始对高最低工资的副作用感到忧虑：虽然它帮助了低收入者，却从根本上改变了雇佣计算。当入门级薪资被推高至接近有经验员工水平时，新人与老手之间的价值差异被抹平。过去，低起薪可抵消培训成本；如今，新人更昂贵。当一名无经验员工的成本接近有数年经验者时，理性雇主会毫不犹豫选择后者。由于实习生无法立即创造价值以匹配其新价格，企业便关闭了招聘之门。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Governments around the world have been busy raising minimum wages to combat the cost-of-living crisis. While the US minimum wage has stayed low – higher minimum wages have been imposed by many states. The Economist recently wrote about how academics have recently been getting cold feet about the effects of high minimum wages. While they may help the lowest earners, they fundamentally alter the calculus of hiring. By lifting the pay floor for entry-level workers closer to that of experienced staff, these policies may have inadvertently erased the distinction between the two groups. In the past, a lower starting salary offset the cost of on-the-job training. Today, graduates are more expensive. When the cost of an inexperienced worker rivals that of a worker with a few years of experience, the rational employer chooses the proven candidate every time. Since trainees can’t generate immediate value to justify their new price tag, firms close the door to hiring them. The Economist quotes a paper by Hannah Farkas of Columbia University who found that big increases in the wage floor led employers to making working schedules less predictable and the work less safe – with a higher incidence of workplace injuries - in effect they make the job worse to compensate for it paying more.</p>

### 教育泡沫与结构性错配

毕业生陷入两难：就业市场冻结，而生活成本却达数十年新高。通胀侵蚀购买力，城市房价飙升，许多毕业生背负沉重的学生贷款。他们被薪资底线和生活成本双重挤出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This leaves graduates in a precarious position – where they face a frozen job market while grappling with the highest living costs in a generation. Inflation has eroded their purchasing power, housing costs have skyrocketed in the cities where jobs exist, and many carry significant student debt. They are priced out of employment by wage floors and priced out of life by the cost of living.</p>
</details>

雇主越来越依赖线下招聘与人脉网络，这对缺乏家庭背景的工薪阶层毕业生尤为不利。AI系统的滥用已摧毁了招聘方与申请者之间的信任——面对每名学生21.7份AI生成的简历，招聘方关闭了“消防水龙带”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Employers increasingly retreat to offline hiring and personal networks. This disadvantages working-class graduates who have fewer family connections with the ability to influence hiring decisions. The trust between recruiter and applicant has evaporated due to the use of AI systems. Faced with 21.7 applications per student—many generated by AI bots—recruiters turn off the firehose.</p>

学生看到门关上，便试图买更大的钥匙：硕士入学人数激增。这就像为漏水的船钻另一个洞来排水——若本科历史学位找不到工作，那“高级历史”硕士学位就能让OpenAI相信你能写代码吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Students see the door closing and respond by buying a bigger key. Enrollment in Master’s programs has skyrocketed in recent years. It's like trying to fix a leak in your boat by drilling another hole to let the water out. If your Bachelor's in History didn't get you a job, surely a Master's in Advanced History will convince Open AI that you can write code.</p>
</details>

恐惧驱动了高学历热潮，但硕士的回报率也在缩水。研究显示，40%的美国硕士项目未能带来实际财务收益；在英国，35岁时拥有硕士学位者薪资常与学士学位者持平。学生陷入学历军备竞赛，反而稀释了所追求的资格价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fear is one of the drivers of the growth in advanced degree programs – but the returns to earning a master’s degree have started shrinking too. Research shows that 40 percent of US master’s programs deliver no real financial benefit. In Britain, graduates with master’s degrees often earn similar salaries to those with a bachelor’s degree by age 35. Students have found themselves in an arms race of credentials that devalues the very qualifications they chase.</p>
</details>

并非所有学位都等价。美国“平等机会研究基金会”（Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity）分析指出，工程、护理和经济学学位终身投资回报可超50万美元；而创意艺术、社会关怀、农业、英语、哲学、教育和心理学学位则常带来负回报。“通往中产阶级的门票”已不再是泛化的学位，而是与市场高度契合的特定技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not all degrees are created equal. Analysis by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity – a US based think-tank highlights a stark divide. While engineering, nursing, and economics degrees can offer a lifetime Return on Investment of over half a million dollars - degrees in creative arts, social care, agriculture, English, philosophy, education, and psychology frequently result in a negative financial return. The "ticket" to the middle class is no longer a generic degree; it is a specific, market-aligned skillset.</p>
</details>

乔治城大学研究人员指出：你选择的**专业**，比你上哪所大学更重要。尽管最差的美国大学几乎无法提供价值，但一般而言，进入公立大学的学生回报率反而高于昂贵的私立非营利学校——尽管后者标榜“非营利”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to researchers at Georgetown University - the subject that you pick matters more than the university you attend. While the worst US colleges provide their students with next to no value. In general - people who enroll in America’s public universities get a better return on investment than students who go to the more prestigious private non-profit ones – which – despite being nonprofits - tend to be significantly more expensive.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，研究显示男性接受大学教育的机会成本更高——因为他们更可能从事无需学位的高薪技术工种，如水管、电气或建筑。这四年脱产的成本，对男性而言更难被合理化。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Interestingly, research shows that men face a higher opportunity cost for attending university - as men are more likely to work in skilled trades—like plumbing, electrical work or construction—which offer high earnings without the need for a degree, the financial sacrifice of four years out of the workforce is harder to justify.</p>

### 重新发现“实体价值”：从办公室到仓库

当玻璃幕墙的办公门关闭，另一扇门正打开——通向仓库、建筑工地与教室。彭博社报道，曾被毕业生忽视的岗位——如代课教师、监狱警卫——申请人数激增。亚特兰大一家交通引导公司每周收到80份申请，五年前仅为10份。尽管整体失业率仍维持在4.3%的较低水平，但失业者滞留时间更长。这些“不光彩”的工作提供了许多办公室岗位已不再保证的东西：稳定性。它们难以被自动化，人员流动率也在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As the glass-walled office door closes, another door opens to the warehouse, the construction site, and the classroom. Bloomberg reports that there has been a surge in applications for roles graduates once ignored like substitute teachers and prison guards. According to the article, an Atlanta based traffic-flagging company now receives up to 80 job applications a week, compared with just ten five years ago. While the overall jobless rate remains fairly low at 4.3% - those out of work are lingering in unemployment for longer. Some of these less glamorous jobs offer what many office roles no longer guarantee: stability. They are hard to automate, and turnover in these roles is falling.</p>
</details>

吊诡的是，曾被热捧的Zoom革命反而强化了“实体在场”的价值。企业差旅已恢复至疫情前水平，因为商业重新发现了一个简单真理：**人只卖给真人**。我们曾以为Zoom会杀死商务旅行，但事实是：没人能用穿着睡裤的虚拟人签下百万美元合同——除非你卖的是睡裤，那倒是个明智之举！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Paradoxically, the Zoom revolution that everyone was excited about in 2020 has reinforced the value of physical presence. Corporate travel is rebounding to pre-pandemic levels because businesses have rediscovered a simple truth: people buy from people.

### 全球差异与结构转型

尽管英语国家毕业生就业困难，但这并非全球现象。南欧却呈现出意外亮点：意大利的毕业生失业率降至1990年代以来最低，希腊从债务危机时期的40%降至10%以上，西班牙与葡萄牙保持稳定或改善。这些经济体避开了2020年代的科技金融狂热，如今受益于欧盟复苏基金——刺激了对工程师与项目经理的需求。

<details>

<p class="english-text">While the job situation has been tough for college graduates in the Anglosphere – it is not a global problem, Southern Europe offers a surprising bright spot. Italy’s graduate unemployment rate is at its lowest since records began in the 1990s. Greece has fallen from 40 percent during the debt crisis to just over 10 percent. Spain and Portugal show stability or improvement. These economies avoided the tech-and-finance binge of the 2020s and now benefit from EU recovery funds - stimulating demand for engineers and project managers.</p>

企业结构正在变化。美国雇主协会（American Society of Employers）指出，传统金字塔式组织——顶层少数高管、中层大量管理者与高价值贡献者、底层无数初级员工——正让位于“钻石结构”：底座变窄，中层膨胀。

<p class="english-text">Corporate structures appear to be changing.

企业大量雇佣中年专家，却前所未有地减少招聘新人。这节省了当前培训成本，但危及领导力梯队建设。据《金融时报》报道，一些招聘者警告：今天不招初级员工，15年后公司将面临生存危机。

普华永道首席AI官丹·普里斯特（Dan Priest）告诉《经济学人》，结构最终可能演变为“沙漏型”——AI吞噬中层管理，让AI原生毕业生直接跃升至领导岗位。但这种乐观依赖一个目前看来已断裂的准入机制，我不确定它是否现实。

</details>

毕业生岗位远未灭绝，但它们更稀少、竞争更激烈、获取更难。要找到一份工作，你必须更多依赖人脉，而非生成AI求职信或在线申请。地理、性别与行业都在塑造结果——今天，你所学专业的重要性远超以往。AI确实在影响毕业生招聘，但经济不确定性、学历通胀与结构性变革同样扮演着关键角色。

尽管逆风强劲，整体失业率仍处于历史低位——如果你在找工作，至少不是在衰退期，结果终会好起来。但你必须采用不同策略来脱颖而出。“纸面天花板”正在裂开，你的就业能力不再仅取决于学术资格。**可验证的技能**比文凭本身更重要。当前最紧缺的技能，是技术能力与人文关怀能力的结合：熟练技工、专业程序员仍供不应求。经济并未崩溃，但正在重构。
